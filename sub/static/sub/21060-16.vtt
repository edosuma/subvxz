00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:40.833
in a court of law.

00:42.633 --> 00:45.367
-I became a police officer
because I wanted to be able

00:45.400 --> 00:48.467
to help my community
and work with people.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.200
There's a lot of people
that need assistance,

00:51.233 --> 00:54.500
and I wanted to be able
to better...

00:54.533 --> 00:58.200
uh, better my community
and better the people
that I work with.

00:58.233 --> 01:00.767
-(radio chatter)

01:00.800 --> 01:06.967
-Going to a carjacking,
that, uh... subject just took
a car at gunpoint

01:07.067 --> 01:09.067
at a, uh, shopping plaza.

01:09.067 --> 01:10.767
-(radio chatter)

01:10.800 --> 01:15.533
-Described as a Hispanic male
carjacked the vehicle
with a gun.

01:15.567 --> 01:17.833
-Running, running on the right.
-Okay, I got it.

01:17.867 --> 01:19.267
Get out here.

01:22.133 --> 01:24.800
-(radio chatter)
-(engine racing)

01:27.733 --> 01:30.467
-You guys got the car?

01:30.500 --> 01:33.333
-Let's go up with it,
go up with it, move, move.

01:33.367 --> 01:36.300
-I can't see! I can't see!
-Watch-- Watch that side.

01:36.333 --> 01:37.733
It's clear, it's clear,
it's clear.

01:37.767 --> 01:41.333
Go through. Go through.
-(radio chatter)

01:41.367 --> 01:43.700
-(siren wailing)
-Driver! Come on!

01:43.733 --> 01:45.333
-That was the vehicle!

01:45.367 --> 01:46.600
-Stay!

01:46.633 --> 01:49.567
-(siren wailing)

01:49.600 --> 01:51.533
-He ducked through
the backyard.

01:51.567 --> 01:53.300
-Okay.
He went in the backyard
over here.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.500
Watch over there!
-Where? Which one?

01:55.533 --> 01:56.933
-The one right in the middle.

01:56.967 --> 01:59.233
-The one right here!
He jumped foot, right here!

01:59.267 --> 02:01.967
-Watch your corner.
Stay deep, stay deep,
stay deep.

02:02.067 --> 02:04.867
We do have K-9's en route
to this location, right?

02:04.900 --> 02:06.700
There's a possibility
that he may be back here.

02:06.733 --> 02:09.867
We don't wanna walk through
because of the fact
that he has the gun.

02:11.867 --> 02:14.400
Right now we're waiting
for a K-9 unit to arrive,

02:14.433 --> 02:16.833
and we're gonna clear this
with the K-9.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.333
-He's saying
nobody's home, Tony.

02:18.367 --> 02:22.433
-Last we heard was
he jumped the fence
into this backyard.

02:22.467 --> 02:24.600
Again, it's a subject
that's armed with a gun.

02:24.633 --> 02:26.533
He carjacked a vehicle.

02:26.567 --> 02:28.867
So we're gonna clear it
with the K-9.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.400
-Ready?
-Mm-hm.

02:38.667 --> 02:40.600
-Get the wall right here.

02:40.633 --> 02:42.733
-(sirens in distance)

02:44.500 --> 02:46.733
-Show yourself or you're
gonna get bit!

02:49.067 --> 02:51.467
Make sure we got people
posted on that wall.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.267
-Hey, right there!
There he is!

02:53.300 --> 02:55.300
There he is,
on top of the house!
He's right here!

02:55.333 --> 02:58.333
-Oh, got him running north.
-All right, come on!

02:58.367 --> 02:59.833
-(horse whinnying)
-(dog barking)

02:59.867 --> 03:00.967
-Watch that gate.

03:01.067 --> 03:03.767
-(horse whinnying)
-I got it.

03:06.733 --> 03:08.700
-Looks like he's going west.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.733
-Northeast bound
-No, he went this way.

03:11.767 --> 03:13.233
-He went to the right.
-Yeah, right.

03:13.267 --> 03:16.167
-He went to the right,
where you're at, Stahl.
-He went right.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.500
Right there.

03:17.533 --> 03:20.633
-I think they got him.
Don't they?
-He might be here.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.367
-You're gonna get bit
by the K-9! You better come out!

03:39.933 --> 03:42.067
You better come out
or you're gonna get bit!

03:42.100 --> 03:44.267
-(dog barking)

03:44.300 --> 03:46.067
-Get your hands up!
Hands up!

03:46.067 --> 03:48.767
-(clattering)
-(man yelling)

03:48.800 --> 03:50.067
-(bleeping)

03:50.067 --> 03:51.567
-Hey! Get on the ground!
-Get on the ground!

03:51.600 --> 03:52.600
-Get on the ground!

03:52.633 --> 03:54.067
-(man yells)

03:54.067 --> 03:55.767
-Let him-- Let him
get the dog off.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.700
-(groaning)

03:57.733 --> 04:00.967
-He hasn't been checked
yet, guys. Keep his hands.
Keep his hands.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.333
Where's the gun?
-It wasn't my gun.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.167
-Where is it?
-Where'd you throw it?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.100
-I don't want some little kid
walking home from school

04:06.133 --> 04:07.867
and finding it!
-I don't have it.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.967
-Here, stand him up.
Stand him up. He's gonna
walk (indistinct).

04:10.067 --> 04:11.500
-Stand up, all right?

04:13.133 --> 04:17.600
-Has anybody...
got the victim?
-Nobody else outstanding.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.700
-What was the deal today, man?
-Nothing, really.

04:19.733 --> 04:22.800
-Nothing, really?
Were you just driving
the car, just wanted

04:22.833 --> 04:23.867
a ride?
-Yeah.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.233
-Yeah?
Why the gun?

04:25.267 --> 04:27.233
-I just thought it would be
much easier.
-Less resistance

04:27.267 --> 04:28.633
from the people
you took the car from?

04:28.667 --> 04:30.800
-Yeah.
-You know how dangerous
that can be, right?

04:30.833 --> 04:32.067
-Yeah.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.433
-Carlos?
Listen to me, Carlos.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.667
You understand the most
important thing right here

04:35.700 --> 04:37.267
is to retrieve that weapon.
-Yeah.

04:37.300 --> 04:40.167
-Okay? And your safety.
-It must be in the car,
most likely.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.900
Understand that we're getting
the fire department to come out
here and talk to you.

04:42.933 --> 04:46.067
That's our number one concern
is you getting treated, okay?

04:46.100 --> 04:47.833
-All right.
-But understand this.
Where I'm gonna keep

04:47.867 --> 04:51.333
harping on this, is
the gun that was used--

04:51.367 --> 04:53.633
if it's not in the car,
we need to find that.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.200
-All right.
-That's very imperative, okay?

04:55.233 --> 04:57.967
-You keep saying "most likely."
Did you leave the car
with the gun?

04:58.067 --> 05:00.767
-Yeah, I left it in the car.
-Where at in the car?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.367
-It's probably, like,
on the left seat.
-Under the-- I'm sorry?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.233
-On the left seat,
under the driver's seat.

05:05.267 --> 05:06.933
-Under--?
-Left it on the driver's seat?

05:06.967 --> 05:08.867
Underneath the driver's seat
or on the driver's seat?

05:08.900 --> 05:10.667
-On the left seat,
it's on the side.

05:10.700 --> 05:13.433
-On the side?
-So it's in the compartment
on the driver's door?

05:13.467 --> 05:15.567
-Yeah.
-All right, Carlos.
We're just gonna have you

05:15.600 --> 05:17.867
come over
in this other vehicle. Okay?

05:17.900 --> 05:20.967
We're gonna go over
and talk with the victim now.

05:21.067 --> 05:22.500
Hi, ma'am.
Tell me real quick
what happened.

05:22.533 --> 05:26.300
-Okay.
I went to the store
on 67th Avenue

05:26.333 --> 05:29.467
and Bethany, Fry's Market.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.500
I proceeded to open the door.
-Okay.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.233
-And then I felt a tug
on my door, and I turned around,

05:35.267 --> 05:38.333
and I saw this kid. I said,
"Well, what do you want?"

05:38.367 --> 05:40.867
-And so he--
-And-- And he tugged again.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.467
He tugged on the door again,
and he opened it.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.133
-What did he say to you?
-He says, "Get out of your car."

05:47.167 --> 05:48.867
-Okay.
-I said, "What do you want?"

05:48.900 --> 05:51.500
He said, "Get out of your car."
-Was he holding the gun
at that point in time?

05:51.533 --> 05:55.367
-At that point, I--
I didn't realize he had the gun
until I looked down like this,

05:55.400 --> 05:57.133
and I saw it.
-Thank you.

05:57.167 --> 06:00.167
-When I arrived, I saw him
in the vehicle, and, uh,
when we approached the vehicle,

06:00.200 --> 06:02.667
it took off, and then
it ended up crashing over here.

06:02.700 --> 06:05.867
-Okay.
So you can see in the map door
of the driver's door right here,

06:05.900 --> 06:09.767
you can see the top portion
of the semi-automatic gun
sitting in that compartment

06:09.800 --> 06:12.200
right there.
So he says it's the gun
that he used,

06:12.233 --> 06:14.533
and it's right where
he told us it was gonna be at.

06:14.567 --> 06:17.067
-Thank God that the victim
wasn't hurt in this case.
-Hm. Yeah.

06:17.100 --> 06:21.367
So we'll get that collected,
and then, uh, we'll probably
get it processed.

06:21.400 --> 06:25.500
-And, uh, he's looking at, uh,
another investigative lead
in another carjacking

06:25.533 --> 06:29.067
that happened, I believe,
yesterday or early
this morning as well.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.667
-Okay.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.567
-Okay, Carlos?
-It's not even like a real gun.
It's just a pellet gun.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.233
-Just a pellet gun? All right.
-Yeah.

06:35.267 --> 06:37.133
-And you didn't know the person
you took the car from?

06:37.167 --> 06:38.367
-No, I didn't know her at all.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.300
All right.
And you used a gun to do it?

06:40.333 --> 06:41.367
The pellet gun?
-Yeah.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.233
-So that led us up
to this point?

06:43.267 --> 06:45.567
You know how dangerous
that can be, right?

06:45.600 --> 06:47.133
You just wanted a ride.

06:47.167 --> 06:49.767
-Yeah.
-Basically, is what
it comes down to, huh?

06:49.800 --> 06:53.300
All right.
Okay, well, um...

06:53.333 --> 06:56.933
your charges at this point
in time is for the carjacking,

06:56.967 --> 07:00.733
um, and, uh, probably
the armed robbery as well.

07:00.767 --> 07:02.567
-So multiple felonies.
-Multiple felonies.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.600
-Okay.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.667
-I really do love my job.
I love to hunt.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.533
I love to get out there
and look for the guns
and the drugs and the action.

07:10.567 --> 07:14.700
But it's not the same feeling
that you get helping somebody.

07:14.733 --> 07:18.067
My calm demeanor in talking
to them and explaining
step by step

07:18.067 --> 07:21.067
how the process works
and, you know, you see
that relief

07:21.100 --> 07:23.800
that comes from them,
like, okay, it's not so bad.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.367
We're heading to a breach
of peace.

07:25.400 --> 07:29.900
Um, there was a--
Dispatch gave us a description
of a male and female,

07:29.933 --> 07:32.167
physical, in the parking lot
at the Waffle House.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.867
My supervisor arrived on scene
first, and she said there was
a vehicle leaving the scene.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.767
She actually just called out
on the radio that she's got
the vehicle stopped.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.533
So, we're trying to get
to the complaint and determine

07:43.567 --> 07:45.967
if in fact we do have a crime
that has been committed.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.867
As of now all we know
is, uh, a male and female
were physical.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.367
-(radio chatter)

07:53.300 --> 07:56.667
-Hey, now, that man,
he hit both of us in our mouth!

07:56.700 --> 07:58.867
-Okay.
-And I'm pressing charges.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.467
-Okay.
-He hit my cousin in her mouth
and she's (bleep) bleeding.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.500
Okay. I know you're upset,
but talk to me.
Do you know this guy?

08:04.533 --> 08:06.700
-No! And he rubbed
my (bleep)! No!

08:06.733 --> 08:09.700
-You guys were just arguing?
-No, I don't even know him!

08:09.733 --> 08:11.667
-Ma'am, let me take a look
at your mouth, are you bleeding?

08:11.700 --> 08:14.567
-I don't even know
this (bleep) man.
He just got up and hit me.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.900
-Can I--
-(bleep)

08:15.933 --> 08:18.200
-Can I have an ambulance
come and check you out, ma'am?

08:18.233 --> 08:20.200
Can I have an ambulance
come check you out?
-I wanna go home.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.133
I don't even know what
the (bleep) you fighting for.

08:22.167 --> 08:24.300
-Do you wanna press charges?
-He just hit me! That's it!

08:24.333 --> 08:27.067
-I'm sitting inside, eating...
-Okay, okay, okay.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.467
-I'm trying to get her
to come in the car,

08:29.500 --> 08:32.433
and they out here trying
to fight with this (bleep) man
for nothing.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.767
-Okay...
-I don't know what the (bleep)
who I know!

08:34.800 --> 08:36.700
-Do you want me to get
an ambulance here
to check you out?

08:36.733 --> 08:39.200
-Yes! I'm ready to go home!
-And you guys said you both
wanna press charges?

08:39.233 --> 08:40.533
-Yes! I'm pressing charges!
-Okay.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.900
Ma'am, can I talk to you
for just a second over here?

08:42.933 --> 08:44.933
Is that your vehicle
or her vehicle?
-No, that's her vehicle.

08:44.967 --> 08:46.900
-And you don't know him,
you said?
-He was talking to her.

08:46.933 --> 08:49.500
-Okay.
-And he said that we stole
something from him,

08:49.533 --> 08:50.700
which we would never--

08:50.733 --> 08:53.933
-Do you know him at all?
-Never seen him.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.333
Seen him at the club,
that was it, and then
he was here.

08:56.367 --> 08:59.167
-At the strip club?
-Yeah, at the strip club.
She was talking to him--

08:59.200 --> 09:00.967
-Which one, Babe's?
-The, uh-- Yeah, Babe's.

09:01.067 --> 09:03.200
-Okay.
-She was talking to him,
and he just--

09:03.233 --> 09:05.433
he came to the car
and told me that.

09:05.467 --> 09:07.167
-While you were in the car?
-While I was in the car.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.467
He told me that.
-Okay.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.367
-Ripped my (bleep) clothes off.
-And then from there...?

09:10.400 --> 09:13.300
-And then he tried to--
-How did he go
to hitting vehicles together,

09:13.333 --> 09:15.700
what happened there?
-'Cause she jumped in the car,

09:15.733 --> 09:17.500
so he tried to hit the vehicle.
-Okay.

09:17.533 --> 09:20.367
-And he opened and snatched
it open and hit her.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.633
-Okay.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.600
-So I don't know, he--
-Opened the door and hit her?

09:23.633 --> 09:27.067
-He opened the door
and hit her, 'cause he was
trying to get us in the car.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.867
-Okay. When, uh,
EMS gets here, I'll have 'em
check you out, too...

09:29.900 --> 09:31.600
-Damn...
-...just to make sure
there's nothing major.

09:31.633 --> 09:33.133
Try to calm down,
and hang tight for a second.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.067
We'll get some more information
from you, all right?
-Okay.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.367
Did you see
everything that happened?

09:36.400 --> 09:38.400
-Everything. Everything.
-Okay, great.

09:38.433 --> 09:42.067
-She's probably gonna be 10-15,
so don't let her go anywhere.
In the pink.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.533
-In the pink? Okay.
-For sure.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.800
-I was right there,
and then right here
in the middle,

09:45.833 --> 09:48.500
she was backing up
and going forward
and then trying to get him.

09:48.533 --> 09:51.200
So he opened up the car
and hooked her a couple times.

09:51.233 --> 09:52.400
You know, to make her stop,

09:52.433 --> 09:54.167
and then she drove off
into the bushes over there.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.600
And then backed back out,
and then that's when
the female came in here,

09:56.633 --> 09:59.467
went around, went after
that vehicle over there.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.467
-Were you inside
or you're outside already?
-No, I'm outside,

10:01.500 --> 10:03.967
I pull in here, and I hear
a bunch of screaming
and hollering,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.433
and them two
were in a fight inside.
-Okay.

10:06.467 --> 10:09.033
-The vehicle was parked
right here.
-They were initially

10:09.067 --> 10:11.100
right in the front row?
-They were in a fight.

10:11.133 --> 10:13.467
-Was that the girl
in the pink or was that
the driver

10:13.500 --> 10:16.000
that's in the vehicle?
-No, the girl in the pink
got out and started walking,

10:16.033 --> 10:17.833
and them two started
fighting again.
-Okay.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.467
-So then he picks her up,
slams her, and then she
gets into my bag

10:21.500 --> 10:23.533
and starts taking
aftershave and everything else.

10:23.567 --> 10:26.700
Whack! Hit him in the head
with it, and then that episode.

10:26.733 --> 10:28.333
-Okay.
-And then, they made it
over there.

10:28.367 --> 10:30.333
It was a mutual beat-ass,
you know?

10:30.367 --> 10:33.333
-While it's all fresh
on your mind, I'm gonna get you
a written, sworn statement

10:33.367 --> 10:34.700
real quick.

10:34.733 --> 10:37.433
-After watching the video
and the witness statements,

10:37.467 --> 10:40.867
independent witnesses, I think
we should go over there
and talk to her,

10:40.900 --> 10:42.733
and we have enough
for breach of peace.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.767
So we'll go, uh, hook her up
and go from there.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.733
-Hey.
-Takia, I'm gonna explain
to you in just a second here.

10:48.767 --> 10:50.200
Um, just need you
to turn around.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.100
You can set your phone down.

10:52.133 --> 10:54.667
-Go ahead and put
your cigarette down for me.
-Put your cigarette out, please.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.533
Thank you.
We'll explain to you
in just a second

10:56.567 --> 10:58.567
exactly everything
that's going on, all right?

11:00.067 --> 11:02.633
All right,
don't pull against me, just...

11:05.067 --> 11:08.100
Just face forward, thank you.

11:08.133 --> 11:11.633
I am gonna place you
under arrest for breach of peace

11:11.667 --> 11:13.333
for the altercation
that occurred.

11:13.367 --> 11:15.867
-Mm-hm.
-I'll explain a little more
in just a second here,

11:15.900 --> 11:18.067
but that's where we're at
right now, all right?

11:18.100 --> 11:19.167
There we go. Thank you.
-Got it.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.900
All right.
Come over here, please.

11:21.933 --> 11:25.767
-But he hit my cousin.
-That was way after
you started the altercation.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.900
-Mm-hm.
-So, if it wouldn't have been
for that beginning,

11:28.933 --> 11:31.767
we wouldn't be where
we are now, all right?

11:31.800 --> 11:33.233
Any questions?
-No, ma'am.

11:33.267 --> 11:35.767
-Okay, thank you.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.733
-So what we're gonna
go ahead and do is
we're gonna go ahead

11:37.767 --> 11:39.867
and back out of here.
We're gonna let you
go ahead and leave.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.067
Soon as I give you a report
number, you'll be free to leave.
-Okay.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.600
-Okay?
-Hello?

11:43.633 --> 11:45.400
-How are you doing, sir?
I'm Officer Williams

11:45.433 --> 11:46.667
with the Fort Myers
Police Department.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.300
Um, once you got
to the Waffle House,

11:48.333 --> 11:49.900
what started
the fight initially?

11:49.933 --> 11:53.067
-What started the fight
was that she took my hat
and, like, I was trying

11:53.100 --> 11:56.600
to take it back from her.
But at the same time, like,
she wanted money,

11:56.633 --> 12:00.100
but I didn't wanna
give it to her, so she started
kicking my car and stuff

12:00.133 --> 12:02.367
like that, so, like,
I kept on try--
-Which one was it

12:02.400 --> 12:03.467
that was kicking your car?

12:03.500 --> 12:06.333
-Um, like, the one
with the pink...

12:06.367 --> 12:07.767
-Like a jumpsuit kind of?
-Yeah, yeah, her.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.067
-Okay.
And that's what happened
to your taillight?

12:10.067 --> 12:11.700
-Yeah, that's what happened
to my taillight.

12:11.733 --> 12:14.800
Plus, the driver kept on trying
to hit my car...
-Mm-hm.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.733
-...with her car
and stuff like that.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.567
-Okay.
Were you in your car
at that time?

12:18.600 --> 12:20.633
-No, like, I was outside
of the car.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.433
-And you're standing there
as she was trying to...
-What-- What I was doing,

12:23.467 --> 12:27.367
I was dodging it,
just trying not
to get hit from her car.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.100
-Were you in fear
for your safety at that time?

12:29.133 --> 12:32.600
-Of course I was.
Like at one point, like,
they was, inside of my car,

12:32.633 --> 12:35.333
like at one point--
-She said something
about her phone.

12:35.367 --> 12:39.300
Where did that come into play?
-She-- What she saying was,
like, she was trying to dance

12:39.333 --> 12:40.833
for me.
-Uh-huh.

12:40.867 --> 12:43.100
-Um, like at Babe's,
like she accidentally...

12:43.133 --> 12:44.700
-That was at Babe's,
not at Waffle House?

12:44.733 --> 12:46.433
-Yeah.
-Okay. Okay,
she didn't tell me that.

12:46.467 --> 12:48.833
-At Babe's, like,
she cracked her phone there,
but-- but she said,

12:48.867 --> 12:52.233
like, she was trying to dance
for me, and, like, she felt like
I should have to pay

12:52.267 --> 12:54.333
for her phone.

12:54.367 --> 12:55.933
-Did you agree to it
at any point in time?

12:55.967 --> 12:58.767
No. She scratched me
on my neck, and, like,
she broke my taillight--

12:58.800 --> 13:00.900
-Was that at Babe's
when she scratched you
and everything, too?

13:00.933 --> 13:02.233
-No, like, that was
at the Waffle House.

13:02.267 --> 13:03.900
-Once you got
to the Waffle House, okay.
-Mm.

13:03.933 --> 13:06.133
-I don't know if anybody's
informed you or not,
but she is under arrest,

13:06.167 --> 13:08.267
the female that was
in the pink.
Um, we've determined her

13:08.300 --> 13:10.167
to be an aggressor,
and she's under arrest,

13:10.200 --> 13:12.433
with two of our other officers
right now.

13:12.467 --> 13:15.333
I'm not taking you to jail
or anything for breach
of peace.

13:15.367 --> 13:18.633
It's pretty well clear-cut
that you were trying
to get outta there, so...

13:18.667 --> 13:21.067
Take it as a lesson learned,
I mean, hanging out
at the strip club.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.500
It's fun and everything,
but you kinda make yourself
vulnerable hanging out

13:23.533 --> 13:24.900
with strangers, and...
-Yeah.

13:24.933 --> 13:26.500
-So...
-Yeah, that's what happens, man.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.933
Thank you, man, I appreciate it.
-Absolutely. I appreciate
your cooperation.

13:30.933 --> 13:32.633
-I've been a cop for about, uh,
six years.

13:32.667 --> 13:35.767
I'm part of a proactive
detective narcotic unit

13:35.800 --> 13:37.933
that goes out
and actively seeks
drug dealers

13:37.967 --> 13:39.833
and people that commit
violent crimes.

13:39.867 --> 13:43.300
Uh, part of my, uh, duties,
I do backup, uh, patrol

13:43.333 --> 13:46.067
when they call for um,
you know, a second unit,

13:46.100 --> 13:49.133
involved in fights
or something violent.

13:49.167 --> 13:52.233
All right, so we had an officer
call out for another unit

13:52.267 --> 13:55.267
for a second, so...
you could hear the guy
yelling on the radio,

13:55.300 --> 13:58.933
so we're gonna, uh,
go back them up, see
if they need any more help.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.067
What's up?
-How's it going?

14:11.067 --> 14:12.800
-Good.

14:12.833 --> 14:16.300
He thought I wasn't
paying attention when he decided
to make a flinch move at me.

14:18.133 --> 14:19.767
-And did you plan
to ride home right now?

14:19.800 --> 14:21.067
-Yeah, it's like
three blocks away.

14:21.067 --> 14:23.300
-I turn around and there's a car
almost ran him over.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.367
-Okay.
-Because he has no lights,
he has no reflectors

14:25.400 --> 14:26.633
on his bike
so you didn't see him.

14:26.667 --> 14:30.133
So I stop him and go
to start talking to him,
-Yeah...

14:30.167 --> 14:31.867
-...and immediately
the attitude starts right there.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.700
-Okay.
-I get his information,
and he's giving me lip

14:34.733 --> 14:36.933
'cause I'm taking down
his information, calling him in,

14:36.967 --> 14:40.600
and as I'm looking down
to call it in, he does
this flinch at me right there,

14:40.633 --> 14:42.733
so I stuffed everything
in my pocket, pulled him
off the bike.

14:42.767 --> 14:45.633
-Sure. Absolutely.
-Cuffed him, asked him
what his, uh, problem is

14:45.667 --> 14:48.833
there, why he's making
flinch moves at me, if he's
wanting to fight or what.

14:48.867 --> 14:51.100
And, uh, detained him
for the time being--

14:51.133 --> 14:53.167
-Do you not like
the police or...?

14:53.200 --> 14:55.433
What's up, man?
-I don't know, I was just--

14:55.467 --> 14:58.233
seeing I felt like it,
right then.

14:58.267 --> 14:59.533
-Like to fight
a police officer?

14:59.567 --> 15:01.767
-He said he's got ADHD--

15:01.800 --> 15:05.267
-No, I been watching
"Dragon Ball Z" last night.
-Okay.

15:05.300 --> 15:09.367
-And... it was just--
It's nighttime, I'm
on a bike ride.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.533
All I came out for
was a bike ride.
-Sure.

15:12.567 --> 15:17.667
-And, uh, I thought
I could get away
with flinching.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.833
-Is there, like, a reason
you did it or is it,
"Dragon Ball Z" got you

15:20.867 --> 15:23.233
hyped up, or...
-No, I was just
being questioned,

15:23.267 --> 15:26.833
and you know, I'm kind
of the guy, I didn't feel like
being questioned.

15:26.867 --> 15:30.467
-Got it.
-And, uh, I do martial arts.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.333
-Okay.
-Tai chi.

15:32.367 --> 15:34.967
-Cool.
-And so-- And I work hard
at it.

15:35.067 --> 15:38.767
-Cool.
-I'm an impressive person, and
I think I made the wrong move.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.067
-Okay.
Well, I would think so, right?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.367
We're not out here to hurt you.
We wanna help you,

15:43.400 --> 15:46.500
and I know this officer
stopped you 'cause
he didn't want you

15:46.533 --> 15:47.867
to get hit by a car.

15:47.900 --> 15:51.100
-Yeah. You're right.
I apologize, Officer.

15:51.133 --> 15:53.133
(chuckles)

15:53.167 --> 15:54.867
I'm not rude.
-No, okay.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.067
-And I wasn't being rude.
-Sure.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.567
-You got anything
in your pockets?

15:58.600 --> 16:02.233
-I don't know.
I don't want any cop
to check out my pockets

16:02.267 --> 16:05.067
right now.
-You don't want any cop
to check out your pockets?

16:05.100 --> 16:08.167
-No.
-Do you use-- Do you use, uh--
Do you use drugs at all?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.433
-No.
-Okay.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.100
Show me what you did
to this officer.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.233
Show me what you did to him.

16:13.267 --> 16:15.200
-I went like this...
-You did that?

16:15.233 --> 16:16.867
-...when I thought
he wasn't looking.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.400
-Okay, you're under arrest.
You have the right

16:18.433 --> 16:19.733
to remain silent.
Anything you say or do

16:19.767 --> 16:21.233
can be used against you
in the court of law.

16:21.267 --> 16:23.067
You have the right
to the presence of an attorney.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.567
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you
before questioning.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.567
Do you understand your rights?
-But he was far away from me.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.767
-Well, you can't do that
and intimidate a police officer
like that.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.300
That's against the law.
-No, it was far away.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.800
-How far away were you?
-About almost as close
as we are now.

16:33.833 --> 16:36.267
-That's in your personal bubble.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.733
-So wouldn't you say
that that would be something

16:38.767 --> 16:41.367
implicating that you would like
to fight this officer?
-No.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.800
-Let me see your eyes.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.267
Don't kick me.

16:44.300 --> 16:47.267
-No, he does that bull,
like he's gonna charge
or something.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.067
-Okay.
-At this time we're gonna
check your pockets.

16:55.167 --> 16:56.867
-So you really didn't want us
to go in your pockets,

16:56.900 --> 16:58.400
'cause you didn't want us
to find nail polish?

16:58.433 --> 17:00.633
-Yeah, and cigarettes.
I am a member

17:00.667 --> 17:04.633
of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.400
Why didn't you want
your dad finding this stuff
in your room?

17:07.433 --> 17:11.833
-Nail polish?
'Cause I don't think
he likes it very much.

17:11.867 --> 17:13.600
-Emma?
-Who's Emma?

17:13.633 --> 17:16.767
-That's Hermione
from "Harry Potter."
She's popular.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.233
That's why I got that.

17:18.267 --> 17:20.500
-Okay.
-Well, look, man, when
you deal with the police--

17:20.533 --> 17:22.533
we're good guys, man,
we're not out here
to hurt you

17:22.567 --> 17:25.833
or do anything with you.
But it's unacceptable for you
to-- to kind of challenge

17:25.867 --> 17:28.600
an officer, you know
what I mean?
-Yeah. I-- I'm embarrassed

17:28.633 --> 17:30.200
that he caught me.

17:30.233 --> 17:32.933
-Well, I mean, it's okay,
people get stopped,
and we deal with people

17:32.967 --> 17:36.400
all the time.
But you can't-- you can't,
you know, provoke a fight.

17:36.433 --> 17:38.133
-Yeah. I'm lucky
he didn't slam me.

17:38.167 --> 17:40.600
-I know, he's a lot
bigger than you, you know
what I mean?

17:40.633 --> 17:43.867
What kind of martial arts
do you do?
-Tai chi and karate.

17:43.900 --> 17:47.433
-Karate?
What kind of karate?
-I'm training myself.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.800
Regular.
-Do you do like
Youtube videos or--?

17:50.833 --> 17:55.133
-No.
-Just-- Where do you t--
Where do you learn?

17:55.167 --> 17:56.367
Just, friends or--?
-Out in the yard.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.700
-Out in the yard.
Kinda just self-taught?
-Yep.

17:58.733 --> 18:00.833
-Yeah?
How's that going?

18:00.867 --> 18:04.867
-Good.
-What-- What belt are you?
Are you the white belt

18:04.900 --> 18:08.200
or the green belt?
-Well, I can use hard energy,
which is a secret form

18:08.233 --> 18:10.500
of mental power.
-Okay.

18:10.533 --> 18:14.467
-But it's taken me 10 years.
It's extremely powerful.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.900
-Have you ever
been arrested before?

18:15.933 --> 18:19.100
-Um, no.
-You've never been arrested?

18:19.133 --> 18:20.300
-No.
-Ever?

18:20.333 --> 18:21.333
This is your first time?
-Yeah.

18:21.367 --> 18:24.833
-Okay.
-(radio chatter)

18:24.867 --> 18:27.967
-(over radio):
...for petty larceny.
The second is showing

18:28.067 --> 18:31.567
cautions of history
of obstruction in his state
of Nevada--

18:31.600 --> 18:33.333
-I thought you'd never
been arrested?

18:33.367 --> 18:35.133
-Yeah.
-I thought you never
used drugs.

18:35.167 --> 18:38.700
-Why do you lie?
Why lie? Right?

18:38.733 --> 18:43.133
-I don't use drugs.
-Well, you got a drug warrant
out of Lyon County.

18:43.167 --> 18:46.700
-Yeah, I know.
They're freaked out
and thought I had drugs.

18:46.733 --> 18:49.167
-You didn't have drugs?
-No, that-- Well--

18:49.200 --> 18:50.700
-And what about
the stealing warrant?

18:50.733 --> 18:53.633
You got a stealing warrant,
you got a petty larceny warrant,

18:53.667 --> 18:57.400
you have a drug warrant,
you have a traffic warrant.

18:57.433 --> 18:59.200
Um, you have these charges.

18:59.233 --> 19:03.100
-Those are all stuff
from somewhere else that was
weird things--

19:03.133 --> 19:05.500
-So why do you--
Why do you try to fight
the police?

19:05.533 --> 19:07.667
What-- What is the deal
with complying with the police?

19:07.700 --> 19:10.933
You have multiple--
multiple histories
with fighting the police.

19:10.967 --> 19:12.267
What are you doing?

19:12.300 --> 19:14.767
-I'm taking
a serious stand. Look.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.067
-(laughs) That is a bad move,
moving on my partner
like that, dude.

19:18.067 --> 19:19.800
-You need to relax.
-I can't stand up
and look at him?

19:19.833 --> 19:21.767
-You need to relax.
-Stay right there.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.967
-Relax.
-Widen your feet and relax.

19:25.067 --> 19:26.633
-You got threatened by that?

19:26.667 --> 19:29.733
-Actually, open the back door.
I'm done with him.

19:29.767 --> 19:32.067
-I'm sorry if I pissed you off,
but you can't square up

19:32.067 --> 19:33.267
to people like that, you know?

19:33.300 --> 19:34.400
-Seriously.
-Don't worry about it.

19:34.433 --> 19:35.767
-Right, well, I'm worried
about it.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.400
I don't want you
to get hurt, okay?

19:38.433 --> 19:39.500
-I'll see you.

19:41.367 --> 19:44.967
-He-- He obviously has
some anger issues that need
to be addressed.

19:45.067 --> 19:47.967
-Fighting the cops
should not be your outlet
for your anger issues.

19:49.733 --> 19:52.167
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.800
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.833 --> 19:54.967
Cover is code three.

19:55.067 --> 19:57.967
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.533 --> 20:06.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.533 --> 20:10.533
-(theme music playing)
