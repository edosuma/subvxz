00:00.873 --> 00:02.357
<i>Previously on Damages...</i>

00:02.711 --> 00:03.695
<i>Meet my granddaughter.</i>

00:03.779 --> 00:06.285
Michael had a chance to be a
father and he ran away from it.

00:06.376 --> 00:08.965
You still don't feel well?
Oh, you're burning up.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.044
I recommend ordering
another round of tests.

00:11.113 --> 00:12.542
What's the worst case scenario?

00:12.625 --> 00:13.585
Leukemia.

00:13.675 --> 00:15.821
- What's this?
- It's a medallion from my unit.

00:15.911 --> 00:20.563
Mr. Herndon can make some
inquires about High Star on your behalf.

00:20.641 --> 00:22.808
High Star was
conducting missions for the CIA.

00:22.879 --> 00:25.100
The operation
is called Dust Devil.

00:25.179 --> 00:28.199
Nasim must have witnessed one
of the Dust Devil missions.

00:28.268 --> 00:30.993
With his testimony and this
document to back him up,

00:31.067 --> 00:32.381
you've got yourself a case.

00:32.455 --> 00:34.774
I can't turn over
my company's records, Trent.

00:34.855 --> 00:36.385
What's it got to do
with the Defense Department?

00:36.460 --> 00:38.838
If this lawsuit
goes forward, it'll blow back on

00:38.913 --> 00:42.308
the military and you guys will wind up
with another Abu Ghraib on your hands.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.547
Everything fits in the bag.

00:43.616 --> 00:45.824
- What sort of locale you thinking of?
- A bus.

00:45.894 --> 00:48.257
It didn't detonate because
the kill switch was still engaged.

00:48.328 --> 00:49.617
Nasim Marwat, you're
under arrest.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.481
What are the charges?

00:50.567 --> 00:52.060
Conspiracy to
commit a terrorist act.

00:52.124 --> 00:53.370
I've done no such thing.

00:53.435 --> 00:55.514
I hacked into the
fed database, no problem.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.382
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57.446 --> 01:00.113
I was able to get your
terrorist into the system.

"Add That Little Hopper To Your Stew"

02:25.622 --> 02:26.771
Hey.

02:34.315 --> 02:35.923
Can anyone hear me?

02:36.235 --> 02:37.411
Hey!

02:42.392 --> 02:43.629
Anyone?

02:43.860 --> 02:45.032
A.C.?

02:53.452 --> 02:54.974
I don't need anything.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.198
I'm okay.
I just want to talk.

03:00.342 --> 03:01.993
Could I please talk to someone?

03:02.450 --> 03:03.549
Please?

03:11.207 --> 03:13.208
Please, brother,
why are they doing this?

03:13.305 --> 03:14.354
I've done nothing wrong.

03:14.423 --> 03:16.483
Shut the fuck up.
I'm not your brother.

03:16.637 --> 03:17.662
Keep moving.

03:58.130 --> 03:59.065
Where is he?

03:59.182 --> 04:02.670
Mr. Marwat is being held at the
Federal Detention Center in Brooklyn.

04:02.758 --> 04:03.987
He's my client.
I want to see him.

04:04.818 --> 04:07.248
That's not possible.
Not yet.

04:07.338 --> 04:09.435
Mr. Marwat may not be
a citizen of this country,

04:09.508 --> 04:13.470
but he's entitled to due process.
He as the right to see counsel.

04:13.542 --> 04:17.079
Ma'am, at this moment, he's
being interviewed by federal agents.

04:17.233 --> 04:21.094
As you know, he is the prime suspect
in an attempted act of terrorism.

04:21.196 --> 04:24.152
Mr. Marwat assisted
Americans in Afghanistan.

04:24.273 --> 04:25.290
Does that sound
like a terrorist?

04:25.364 --> 04:27.252
We have evidence
connecting him to the crime scene.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.174
What exactly
is he charged with?

04:29.257 --> 04:30.854
At this point, he hasn't been.

04:30.935 --> 04:34.736
Is he under arrest?
Have you even Mirandized him?

04:34.832 --> 04:36.165
They're not required to.

04:37.790 --> 04:40.211
There was imminent danger
to the public safety.

04:40.302 --> 04:42.675
The law says he can be questioned
without his attorney present.

04:42.761 --> 04:44.315
Thank you, Bill.
We have this under control.

04:44.392 --> 04:45.662
I was only saying.

04:46.470 --> 04:50.131
So it's been 24 hours, and
he hasn't even been read his rights.

04:50.246 --> 04:51.358
Not yet, ma'am.

04:51.469 --> 04:54.472
Agent Rosetti, when
can I have access to my client?

04:54.559 --> 04:56.465
Once Mr.
Marwat has been thoroughly questioned,

04:56.572 --> 04:58.719
you can talk to him
as much as you want.

04:58.853 --> 05:01.388
We'll notify you when we
can grant you access.

05:15.515 --> 05:16.532
You got him.

05:18.399 --> 05:19.644
A clean shot.

05:19.766 --> 05:24.179
I haven't had a good rabbit
stew since my wife passed.

05:24.279 --> 05:26.436
I think I'm going to
cook this one up myself.

05:28.084 --> 05:31.424
Howard, I can't tell you how
happy I am that you're taking this land.

05:31.856 --> 05:36.603
I mean, the idea of a Home Depot
here-- It just makes me sick.

05:36.715 --> 05:38.780
Well, I'm honored
you accepted my offer, Ed.

05:38.857 --> 05:41.177
Well, you certainly
gave me a good price.

05:41.262 --> 05:44.488
My daddy bought this
land back in the '30s.

05:45.295 --> 05:47.793
The old factory's just right
over that hill there.

05:47.989 --> 05:51.387
Who'd have guessed you could
make a fortune off of gloves?

05:51.516 --> 05:53.074
My dad made
a pile on refrigeration.

05:53.236 --> 05:54.011
No kidding?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.741
Yeah, came over here
from Norway without a kroner.

05:58.444 --> 06:01.207
Settled in Minnesota.
Built an empire.

06:01.309 --> 06:03.430
But, you know what, he never
spent a dime on himself.

06:03.601 --> 06:08.206
Well, he wasn't interested
in money. He believed in the work ethic.

06:08.304 --> 06:09.629
That's exactly right.

06:09.775 --> 06:11.550
My dad used to say,

06:11.648 --> 06:16.036
"making a profit is God's way of
thanking you for working hard."

06:17.011 --> 06:19.312
God and country-- That's
what he was all about.

06:19.407 --> 06:20.397
Amen.

06:20.531 --> 06:22.345
Well, let me ask you
something, Howard.

06:22.456 --> 06:25.555
How are things going over
there in Afghanistan?

06:25.651 --> 06:26.910
I'm not the government, Ed.

06:26.997 --> 06:28.038
I don't choose where we fight.

06:28.125 --> 06:30.127
I just send men over to help
out where they're needed.

06:30.207 --> 06:32.621
I can respect that,
but-- Now don't get me wrong--

06:32.736 --> 06:36.984
I fought in Korea-- But this war's
been going on for ten years.

06:37.088 --> 06:41.577
And the Taliban is still over there
farting falafel and our boys are dying.

06:41.666 --> 06:44.382
- Yes, sir.
- It's been on my mind

06:44.472 --> 06:46.971
mind because my grandson is
just finishing up at boot camp

06:47.076 --> 06:51.180
training, and his unit's going
to be assigned any day now.

06:51.297 --> 06:52.938
I see.

06:53.754 --> 06:55.938
He joined up without
his mother's permission.

06:56.071 --> 06:59.856
My daughter's just terrified
he's going to end up in combat.

06:59.979 --> 07:01.621
It's a mother's job to worry.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.827
I respect your grandson's
desire to serve.

07:06.013 --> 07:07.950
I'm just praying he stays
out of harm's way.

07:11.626 --> 07:14.014
You can add that little
hopper to your stew, Ed.

07:16.184 --> 07:18.357
I'm going to file a
motion to get us access to Nasim.

07:18.466 --> 07:20.119
- It won't matter.
- Why is he here?

07:20.218 --> 07:23.125
I asked him to come,
and he's right, it won't matter.

07:23.230 --> 07:26.806
Nasim is finished as a witness.
He's labeled a terrorist.

07:26.899 --> 07:29.583
Any shred of credibility
he might have had is gone.

07:29.686 --> 07:31.021
Hey, I wouldn't worry about it.

07:31.108 --> 07:33.726
I mean it's not like you guys are
dealing with the CIA or anything.

07:35.142 --> 07:36.830
You took away the decanter.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.142
I knew you were coming.

07:38.228 --> 07:39.992
You think the CIA set Nasim up?

07:40.103 --> 07:41.746
Your witness was
arrested right in

07:41.836 --> 07:43.776
the middle of a deposition
against High Star.

07:43.909 --> 07:45.277
- Timely.
- Howard Erickson

07:45.354 --> 07:46.756
could not have
orchestrated this alone.

07:46.848 --> 07:48.870
It had to be the CIA.

07:48.982 --> 07:51.999
So now it's time to get very
paranoid-- Assuming they'll be

07:52.083 --> 07:53.928
listening in on every
phone call you make.

07:54.029 --> 07:55.820
I had the office swept.
It was clean.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.639
- Cell phones. - We
got rid of them. We're using new ones.

07:58.777 --> 08:00.359
Good.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.536
Well...

08:03.318 --> 08:04.584
you still don't have a witness.

08:05.430 --> 08:09.679
You ladies have any, uh, further
leads, or are we finished here?

08:09.765 --> 08:11.620
Nasim said there was
another American on Chris's

08:11.708 --> 08:14.852
mission who wasn't with High Star.
I suspect he's CIA.

08:14.949 --> 08:16.754
Absolutely.
If the Agency was running ops

08:16.832 --> 08:18.979
over there, they had to
have someone on the ground.

08:19.820 --> 08:21.743
Nasim saw this man in New York.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.369
He can identify him--
That's our lead.

08:23.489 --> 08:25.177
You're gonna try to find a CIA

08:25.274 --> 08:27.788
operative in a city of
eight million people?

08:30.887 --> 08:32.008
Good luck.

08:34.583 --> 08:37.261
Trust me.
He can be useful.

08:38.316 --> 08:40.861
Nasim thought the CIA
guy followed him from the mosque.

08:41.010 --> 08:42.841
We could check the surveillance
cameras in the area.

08:44.241 --> 08:47.136
It's a long shot.
Worth a try.

08:48.429 --> 08:51.149
The government's paying over a
hundred million to renew your contracts.

08:51.246 --> 08:53.164
We need to know you'll be
able to handle the workload.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.526
I can assure you
your money is not being wasted.

08:56.951 --> 08:58.899
My apologies.
Sorry I'm late.

08:58.987 --> 09:00.057
No worries, Jack.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.004
You know Trent
Prowse from Defense.

09:03.088 --> 09:04.535
- Of course. Good to see you.
- Likewise.

09:04.685 --> 09:08.658
Trent was just questioning
our ability to fulfill our contracts.

09:09.812 --> 09:12.045
As we draw down
troops, our need for private

09:12.130 --> 09:14.168
forces will increase
exponentially.

09:14.261 --> 09:18.389
We'll require additional security,
training for the Afghan police force...

09:18.477 --> 09:19.504
We'd anticipated that.

09:19.579 --> 09:22.119
But you've already got men
in Iraq, Middle East, Africa, Japan.

09:22.231 --> 09:23.720
You're not spread too thin?

09:23.809 --> 09:24.940
Absolutely not.

09:25.038 --> 09:27.596
The fact is, we're expanding--
We're recruiting new men.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.385
Will you have the
facilities to train them?

09:29.508 --> 09:30.961
Jack, show him the thing.

09:32.969 --> 09:34.627
Trent, you got to see this.

09:34.752 --> 09:36.005
I got to show you something.

09:39.223 --> 09:40.375
Thanks, Jack.

09:42.474 --> 09:44.363
We're in escrow
on this property here.

09:46.073 --> 09:48.324
That's over 20,000 acres.

09:50.256 --> 09:54.715
Now, we're converting this old
factory into a new ops center,

09:55.039 --> 09:57.060
doubling our training capacity.

09:57.152 --> 09:58.163
I see.

09:58.314 --> 10:01.104
Two landing strips
here for transport, and a new

10:01.188 --> 10:02.814
sniper range right there.

10:03.839 --> 10:05.108
When can you start on all this?

10:05.203 --> 10:07.841
We'll be breaking ground at
the close of escrow, in seven days.

10:09.954 --> 10:11.427
This looks good, Howard.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.204
I'll bring this
back to my people.

10:14.254 --> 10:15.486
- In the meantime...
- Hello?

10:15.576 --> 10:18.136
Here's a complete
breakdown of our anticipated needs.

10:18.237 --> 10:21.361
Um, I'm sorry.
He's in a meeting. One moment.

10:22.415 --> 10:23.816
It's Ed O'Malley.

10:24.326 --> 10:25.679
I should take this, Trent.

10:25.786 --> 10:27.295
It's the man that's
selling me the property.

10:27.388 --> 10:28.378
I think we're done here anyway.

10:28.459 --> 10:29.855
Always a pleasure, Howard.

10:34.058 --> 10:36.581
Ed.
How was that Hasenpfeffer?

10:36.702 --> 10:38.437
I have to go to work now.

10:38.529 --> 10:42.250
But Mrs. Auroro is going to be with you,
and she'll call me if you need me.

10:42.506 --> 10:43.807
Okay.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.553
She's warm.

11:15.794 --> 11:18.007
Yes, but her temperature
has been holding steady.

11:18.173 --> 11:19.993
I'll call you immediately
if anything changes.

11:20.112 --> 11:22.490
- Thanks.
- Uh, of course.

11:22.575 --> 11:24.853
When will you hear
from Dr. Weisler?

11:25.121 --> 11:27.785
I'm expecting her
test results at the end of the day.

11:27.890 --> 11:29.130
I'll let you know.

11:29.627 --> 11:33.874
Ms. Hewes, your son, Catherine's
father, does he know she's sick?

11:33.990 --> 11:36.380
- No.
- Perhaps you should tell him.

11:37.472 --> 11:39.080
I don't know how to reach him.

11:42.213 --> 11:44.693
So we're looking for the man
who followed Nasim from the mosque.

11:44.786 --> 11:46.378
Do you think you could
find anything for us?

11:46.488 --> 11:48.941
Well, the mosque may
have security cameras, and

11:49.031 --> 11:50.914
I'm... I'm sure there are
some banks around there.

11:51.004 --> 11:53.039
I-I can try to dig
up some footage.

11:53.144 --> 11:55.643
Okay, great.
I'll take anything you can find.

11:56.767 --> 11:59.291
Dean Gulickson from
<i>the Times called again.</i>

11:59.389 --> 12:01.184
He wants to talk to you
about the High Star case.

12:01.285 --> 12:04.857
Dean Gulickson?
He's a fine reporter.

12:04.955 --> 12:06.837
I read everything he's
written on Afghanistan.

12:06.918 --> 12:08.219
He knows the place inside out.

12:08.299 --> 12:09.985
It's, uh, still a no.
Thanks, Maggie.

12:10.069 --> 12:11.289
I'm not talking to the press.

12:11.394 --> 12:12.934
Okay.
I'll tell him.

12:14.431 --> 12:17.044
Um, I'll get on
those tapes right away.

12:55.032 --> 12:56.935
Time to pray.

13:02.986 --> 13:04.635
Ms. Hewes, it's Dr.
Weisner.

13:08.119 --> 13:09.438
Put her on.

13:18.226 --> 13:19.871
Yes, it's Patty.

13:20.289 --> 13:21.802
You have the results?

13:35.291 --> 13:36.606
Anything?

13:37.625 --> 13:38.652
No.

13:38.757 --> 13:42.144
I... I can't find Nasim, let alone
someone who's following him.

13:49.312 --> 13:50.733
Are you okay?

13:51.101 --> 13:53.570
I just got Catherine's
test results back.

13:54.982 --> 13:56.012
And?

13:57.833 --> 13:59.260
She's fine.

14:04.178 --> 14:04.919
Oh!

14:06.811 --> 14:08.594
Piss-poor effort, Riccio.

14:08.677 --> 14:10.758
You throw darts worse
than you shoot a rifle.

14:10.860 --> 14:12.392
Man, you can't even
shoot your load.

14:12.489 --> 14:13.971
Could if he was
aiming at your sister.

14:14.067 --> 14:15.671
Stand aside, boys.

14:19.161 --> 14:20.182
Oh!

14:22.313 --> 14:23.677
Oh!

14:25.121 --> 14:26.413
Oh!

14:28.721 --> 14:30.079
Carry on, boys.

14:30.201 --> 14:32.934
All right, try not to
embarrass yourselves.

14:33.284 --> 14:34.602
Nobody pays tonight.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.868
Hope the bar is okay.
It's a little loud.

14:38.971 --> 14:41.927
Ed here is 1st Marines.
Landed at Inchon.

14:42.035 --> 14:42.981
Is that so?

14:43.100 --> 14:44.433
Pour him your best whiskey.

14:44.580 --> 14:48.833
Thank you, Howard.
You mind if we sit down?

14:56.686 --> 14:58.050
You're looking a little green.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.175
Did you get word
on your grandson?

15:00.266 --> 15:02.666
No, everything's fine there.
We got lucky.

15:02.829 --> 15:07.839
His unit was assigned to
Japan for humanitarian work.

15:07.936 --> 15:09.344
That's great news.

15:11.914 --> 15:13.240
What's on your mind?

15:13.788 --> 15:15.231
It's my daughter.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.124
She doesn't want me
selling you the land.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.414
We agreed on a price, but
if she wants to renegotiate...

15:22.553 --> 15:26.008
It's not the money; it's-it's...
it's the politics.

15:26.646 --> 15:30.222
She doesn't want the family property
going over to a mercenary.

15:30.984 --> 15:32.289
Her word.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.310
- I see.
- It seems there's

15:35.388 --> 15:38.903
a slew of lawsuits
against your company.

15:39.008 --> 15:40.354
All dismissed, Ed.

15:40.438 --> 15:42.492
What about the
one pending right now?

15:42.601 --> 15:47.278
She said that some of your men were
killed on an illegal mission.

15:47.378 --> 15:49.177
- Is there any truth to that?
- None.

15:49.270 --> 15:52.344
All of my work is government sanctioned.
It's totally legit.

15:52.438 --> 15:55.901
That case is...
it's-it's a left-wing crusade against me.

15:56.029 --> 15:57.766
Well, my daughter is concerned.

15:57.852 --> 16:01.257
It just doesn't sit
well with her.

16:02.855 --> 16:05.710
I don't want to
butt in here, Ed, but, uh...

16:06.277 --> 16:09.051
Isn't the land yours to sell?

16:10.323 --> 16:11.345
Yeah.

16:12.027 --> 16:17.758
The truth is, Howard, it doesn't
sit well with me, either.

16:23.902 --> 16:27.508
Now, I've got commitments
based on my acquisition of that land.

16:27.638 --> 16:28.940
And I'm sorry, Howard.

16:29.050 --> 16:31.816
No. We had a deal.
We shook hands.

16:31.893 --> 16:33.333
I-I didn't
have all the facts.

16:33.449 --> 16:36.723
Facts?
You have no idea what the facts are.

16:36.795 --> 16:40.099
- Howard... - The men
I train protect Americans.

16:40.189 --> 16:42.915
Lives are at stake here.
Forgive me, Ed, but your

16:43.009 --> 16:47.120
daughter doesn't have the first fucking
clue about what's going on here!

16:49.418 --> 16:53.478
I'm sorry, Howard.
The deal's off.

17:04.342 --> 17:06.108
- Ms. Hewes?
- Yeah.

17:06.295 --> 17:07.713
There's someone
here to see you.

17:07.838 --> 17:09.777
He says he's your son.

17:14.525 --> 17:16.060
I am her son.

17:24.858 --> 17:27.880
You can go home, Maggie.
Please shut the door.

17:33.670 --> 17:36.000
New assistant.
She's cute.

17:40.548 --> 17:42.947
Are you going to offer
me a drink or anything?

17:43.137 --> 17:44.733
No, I'm not.

17:45.747 --> 17:47.713
I heard you
were looking for me.

17:50.453 --> 17:51.792
Yeah.

17:53.895 --> 17:55.458
Here I am.

18:01.986 --> 18:04.526
Do you expect
a hug or something?

18:07.922 --> 18:10.011
I wanted to apologize.

18:10.687 --> 18:12.311
I'm sorry for disappearing.

18:12.407 --> 18:15.354
I just needed to sort some
things out for myself.

18:25.729 --> 18:26.983
Is that it?

18:28.156 --> 18:30.365
Because, if it is, I
need to get home.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.641
I want to see my daughter.

18:34.764 --> 18:37.537
After three years of
neglect, you suddenly care?

18:37.642 --> 18:38.941
How is she?

18:40.825 --> 18:42.704
She's perfect.

19:03.271 --> 19:04.960
So can I see her?

19:09.183 --> 19:11.624
I understand if you
need to think about it.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.760
Here's my information.

19:17.071 --> 19:18.491
Let me know your answer.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.566
Have a good night.

19:30.663 --> 19:32.592
We never really talked
about your case last night.

19:32.683 --> 19:33.537
How's it going?

19:33.664 --> 19:37.257
Well, the CIA is now
involved, and my witness has

19:37.349 --> 19:38.721
been arrested as a terrorist.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.015
- Shit.
- Yeah.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.344
- Is he a terrorist?
- No, he was set up.

19:44.344 --> 19:45.719
Sorry, this is me.

19:46.454 --> 19:47.847
- Did you get a new cell phone?
- Yeah.

19:47.950 --> 19:50.093
We think someone's been
listening in on our calls.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.651
And I have my old phone here.
Shall we crank-call the CIA?

19:53.742 --> 19:57.392
- Can you still make dinner?
- Uh, I'll try.

19:57.505 --> 19:59.296
Hey, you're in
the weeds right now.

19:59.384 --> 20:01.005
Whatever you can swing
is fine with me.

20:01.092 --> 20:02.402
Thanks for
being so understanding.

20:02.490 --> 20:04.195
- Okay.
- Okay, this is me.

20:04.273 --> 20:05.906
Okay, well, bye, babe.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.750
Help me, please.
I need to speak to my lawyers.

20:19.842 --> 20:20.607
Stop talking.

20:20.692 --> 20:22.084
I am innocent.
My family needs me.

20:22.175 --> 20:23.516
Where are you from?

20:23.842 --> 20:25.681
Brooklyn, NYC.
Born and bred.

20:25.761 --> 20:28.388
But your family.
I heard someone call you "Reza."

20:29.233 --> 20:31.111
That is Iranian, yes?

20:31.448 --> 20:33.604
My family left
Iran a long time ago.

20:33.682 --> 20:36.656
- Are you a Muslim?
- Eat.

20:36.739 --> 20:38.485
I'm begging you.
Please help me.

20:38.581 --> 20:43.889
Look into my eyes. I'm like you.

20:45.164 --> 20:46.705
I am an innocent man.

20:53.441 --> 20:56.866
Look, asshole,
you're not like me.

20:57.662 --> 20:59.495
I'm not a terrorist.

21:26.817 --> 21:28.655
Hey, Asgari, your shift's up.

21:29.153 --> 21:30.390
I just gave him dinner.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.216
I was told an official would be
coming by later to see the prisoner.

21:33.322 --> 21:36.097
Oh, thanks. How far'd you get?

21:36.224 --> 21:37.609
Did about half of it.

21:37.711 --> 21:40.178
17 across is a bitch, though.
Six letters.

21:40.272 --> 21:41.363
See if you can get it.

21:41.455 --> 21:43.213
It's not "if," my
friend, but when.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.688
- Have a good one.
- Yeah.

21:56.835 --> 21:57.944
Hello.

22:05.373 --> 22:08.231
Whoa! Hi.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.218
I need to talk
about the case with you.

22:12.218 --> 22:13.469
Anything the matter?

22:13.585 --> 22:15.170
I'd rather not
discuss it over the phone.

22:15.262 --> 22:17.348
Can you meet me in a half
hour at the park on 15th?

22:17.470 --> 22:19.161
Yeah, I'll be there.

22:39.318 --> 22:40.436
Patty.

22:41.358 --> 22:42.819
Agent Rosetti called.

22:43.264 --> 22:45.621
Nasim's being Mirandized at 1:00

22:45.713 --> 22:47.079
We can talk to him
this afternoon.

22:47.175 --> 22:48.380
Great.

22:50.261 --> 22:51.971
So, what's so urgent?

22:53.056 --> 22:54.850
I wanted you to
take a look at this.

23:02.599 --> 23:04.165
Very interesting.

23:04.785 --> 23:05.706
Mmm.

23:10.142 --> 23:11.470
Do you think it's true?

23:13.092 --> 23:17.163
Well, if it is, it could
answer a lot of questions for us.

23:19.245 --> 23:21.562
You purposely called
me on your old phone.

23:21.664 --> 23:24.022
This guy must have
been listening in on my calls.

23:24.113 --> 23:26.586
That is the only way that he
could have tracked Nasim.

23:26.683 --> 23:28.328
Very smart, this one.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.683
So I thought I'd
lure him to the park.

23:30.776 --> 23:32.499
Did you notice
anyone watching us?

23:32.605 --> 23:36.641
I wasn't looking.
But I had someone taking photographs.

23:38.442 --> 23:40.659
He's actually quite useful.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.835
What are we looking for?

23:46.429 --> 23:47.795
Could be anyone.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.798
I mean, just because you made the call
doesn't mean the guy was listening.

23:51.025 --> 23:52.636
Or that he showed up.

23:52.843 --> 23:54.435
You don't even know if
your phone was tapped.

23:57.165 --> 23:58.501
My bet's on him.

24:05.151 --> 24:07.002
My money's on the
kid with the skateboard.

24:07.170 --> 24:09.487
The CIA are sneaky little bastards.

24:09.576 --> 24:11.509
Nasim knows who
we're looking for.

24:11.605 --> 24:13.442
He's being Mirandized today.

24:13.519 --> 24:16.571
We'll bring him the photos
and hope he can make an I.D.

24:30.826 --> 24:32.174
You're white as a as a sheet.

24:32.481 --> 24:34.238
I'm just getting over the flu.

24:34.904 --> 24:37.855
Nasim Marwat.
Did you know about this guy?

24:37.943 --> 24:39.684
No, sir, but I should've.

24:39.769 --> 24:42.302
An Afghan tries to
blow up a New York City bus.

24:42.379 --> 24:43.497
You're goddamn right
you should've.

24:43.581 --> 24:45.023
He wasn't on any list.

24:45.108 --> 24:48.049
He slipped through the cracks.
No one's heard of this fuck.

24:48.157 --> 24:52.178
I got guys in seven countries trying
to round up intel on him right now.

24:52.272 --> 24:53.617
It's a little fucking late.

24:57.146 --> 25:00.081
The device Marwat used had a kill
radius of more than a hundred feet.

25:00.170 --> 25:02.543
Lucky for you the asshole
forgot to arm the damn thing.

25:04.237 --> 25:05.721
Have the Feds questioned him?

25:05.807 --> 25:06.821
Yeah, but they got nothing.

25:06.897 --> 25:08.017
They'll be arraigning him today.

25:08.101 --> 25:12.321
It's a bad idea.
We need to hold this Marwat.

25:12.436 --> 25:14.502
Let's not give him a
chance to lawyer up.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.171
The DOJ isn't
the Wild West anymore.

25:17.266 --> 25:20.413
He's entitled to a speedy
trial, access to counsel.

25:20.504 --> 25:22.443
The longer he's in
custody, the longer he's not

25:22.531 --> 25:25.597
communicating with any
accomplices on the street.

25:25.682 --> 25:28.188
I fucked up.

25:28.770 --> 25:33.301
Let me set it straight, spend
some time alone with this guy.

25:33.432 --> 25:34.872
See what I can get out of him.

25:35.130 --> 25:36.465
How do you suggest we hold him?

25:36.566 --> 25:38.141
Drop all the charges.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.724
And then?

25:40.819 --> 25:43.384
Lock him up on
immigration violations.

25:43.782 --> 25:46.784
Then we can keep him away from his
attorneys as long as we need.

25:49.901 --> 25:54.990
I run this up the flagpole, it
comes back to fuck me, you'll be next.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.412
You gonna make the call or not?

25:58.581 --> 26:00.422
Dean Gulickson from
<i>the Times called again.</i>

26:01.494 --> 26:02.496
Can you tell him no?

26:02.637 --> 26:04.309
I already did.

26:04.466 --> 26:07.386
Car's waiting to take you and Patty to Mr.
Marwat's arraignment.

26:07.481 --> 26:09.710
- Great.
- We won't be needing the car.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.135
What happened?

26:12.238 --> 26:15.036
Nasim's arraignment
has been canceled.

26:15.136 --> 26:18.314
The government has dropped the
conspiracy charges against him.

26:18.412 --> 26:19.255
Just like that?

26:19.353 --> 26:21.771
Now they're holding him
on an immigration violation.

26:21.900 --> 26:24.987
Which means that we don't
have access to him.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.667
He's denied the
right to attorney.

26:27.763 --> 26:28.798
They can just do that?

26:28.887 --> 26:30.369
Well, it seems like
these people have the power to

26:30.444 --> 26:32.732
do whatever they
damn well please.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.231
We need Nasim to
I.D. the guy in the park.

26:35.365 --> 26:38.479
I'll keep helping
with this, Ellen, but only

26:38.575 --> 26:40.442
if you're willing
to go all the way.

26:40.552 --> 26:41.854
I am.

26:43.912 --> 26:45.329
All right, then.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.460
Let's get Agent
Rosetti back in here.

26:50.556 --> 26:52.251
I spoke to O'Malley
and his daughter.

26:52.339 --> 26:54.315
- And? - I offered
them the amount we discussed.

26:54.394 --> 26:56.411
They won't budge.
More money's not gonna do it.

26:57.304 --> 26:59.188
Did they even counter?

26:59.279 --> 27:00.773
Howard, there's no negotiation.

27:00.843 --> 27:04.372
It's the principle of the thing, and
you can't negotiate with principles.

27:04.495 --> 27:06.130
No matter how
upside down, pretzel-twisted

27:06.217 --> 27:08.108
and jack-fucked those
principles are!

27:08.199 --> 27:10.809
They don't want to sell
because of case against you.

27:10.911 --> 27:15.215
This fucking case!
Do we have any options?

27:15.303 --> 27:17.199
I checked into the Bruer
Farm and the golf course.

27:17.280 --> 27:22.038
No one wants to sell.
At this point we're hemmed in.

27:22.136 --> 27:23.407
Unacceptable!

27:46.244 --> 27:47.862
Do not speak my language.

27:54.755 --> 27:56.708
Have you told anyone about me?

28:01.907 --> 28:03.543
I don't know you.

28:03.654 --> 28:06.167
But you saw
me outside the mosque.

28:06.804 --> 28:07.941
Yes.

28:08.076 --> 28:09.718
What do you know, Nasim?

28:12.186 --> 28:15.383
What did Chris Sanchez
tell you about me?

28:19.466 --> 28:24.139
We know where you live, Nasim.

28:25.038 --> 28:28.473
I'm worried about your
wife, your children...

28:31.662 --> 28:34.285
Without a man around
to protect them.

28:34.637 --> 28:36.671
Shame what happened
to your father.

28:37.751 --> 28:46.214
Now, I can help you get home, but you're
gonna have to tell me the truth.

28:52.396 --> 28:54.543
I saw you once in Afghanistan.

28:55.146 --> 28:57.064
But Chris told me
nothing about you.

28:57.166 --> 28:58.178
When did you see me?

28:58.267 --> 29:00.378
Just before the mission
where Chris's men were killed.

29:00.489 --> 29:01.548
What were you doing there?

29:01.642 --> 29:03.157
I would scout
the area for Chris.

29:03.244 --> 29:05.608
Did you tell the lawyers
that you saw me over there?

29:06.523 --> 29:07.487
Yes.

29:07.578 --> 29:09.445
Did you tell
'em saw me in New York?

29:12.045 --> 29:14.271
Yes, I told them, but
they don't know who you are

29:15.066 --> 29:17.619
because I don't know
who you you are.

29:23.074 --> 29:27.581
Okay.
I believe you, Mr. Marwat.

29:27.863 --> 29:33.816
Please send me home.
I beg you.

29:35.263 --> 29:37.051
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

29:37.167 --> 29:41.161
You're being held here on
immigration violations right now.

29:42.174 --> 29:44.242
I'm gonna get you deported.

29:44.512 --> 29:45.810
That will get me home?

29:45.907 --> 29:47.269
Lickety-split.

29:47.373 --> 29:51.339
I'll just need you to sign some
documents to waive your right to

29:51.438 --> 29:54.867
speak to an attorney or
claim political asylum.

29:55.491 --> 29:56.849
I will sign anything.

29:56.947 --> 29:59.159
Good.
I'll be back with the documents.

29:59.255 --> 30:05.793
But Nasim, if you ever tell anyone about
me, I'll kill your whole family.

30:12.885 --> 30:14.357
Guard?

30:28.312 --> 30:30.999
So how are you
going to find this CIA guy?

30:31.093 --> 30:32.264
I have no idea.

30:32.385 --> 30:34.828
And you still can't
get access to your witness?

30:34.935 --> 30:37.834
He hasn't even
been read his rights.

30:49.270 --> 30:50.883
Mazel Tov!

30:54.017 --> 30:55.420
It's beautiful.

31:02.016 --> 31:03.897
Can you believe he did
that to her in public?

31:04.077 --> 31:05.874
Well, she looks pretty happy.

31:07.192 --> 31:10.464
Because she has to be.
She has an audience.

31:10.574 --> 31:12.495
So you don't
like public displays.

31:13.757 --> 31:15.615
That's too bad because...

31:16.582 --> 31:18.489
I was going to ask you...

31:19.532 --> 31:21.123
if you wanted...

31:22.217 --> 31:22.799
Uh...

31:23.532 --> 31:24.772
a mint.

31:27.430 --> 31:30.347
You're an asshole.
Oh, Jesus!

31:30.620 --> 31:32.529
Your expression was priceless.

31:32.617 --> 31:34.308
Because you
scared the shit out of me.

31:34.415 --> 31:37.413
I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about marriage.

31:37.505 --> 31:39.515
It's just not
for me; not right now.

31:39.635 --> 31:41.893
Do you think that you
don't want to get married

31:41.980 --> 31:43.710
because of what happened
to your fiancé?

31:45.227 --> 31:47.405
I mean, you don't have to talk
about it, if you don't want to.

31:48.449 --> 31:49.955
No, it's fine.

31:52.522 --> 31:54.272
His name was David, right?

31:55.381 --> 31:57.647
Yeah. David.

32:00.618 --> 32:02.282
How'd this get in here?

32:03.311 --> 32:04.987
I don't know.

32:10.292 --> 32:12.463
Maybe it's got
something to do with him, yeah.

32:15.799 --> 32:17.676
I was a different person.

32:18.906 --> 32:20.735
You know, it was another time.

32:22.609 --> 32:24.285
Is that a good thing?

32:25.632 --> 32:27.348
It doesn't really matter.

32:27.691 --> 32:30.174
Yeah. I can't change it.

32:54.295 --> 32:55.800
Can I come in?

32:56.260 --> 32:57.785
Uh... sure.

33:05.745 --> 33:07.379
Out late last night?

33:08.117 --> 33:09.851
My job keeps me up.

33:13.155 --> 33:14.543
So, have you thought about it?

33:14.684 --> 33:17.009
Yeah. I have.

33:17.677 --> 33:20.085
Can I see my daughter?

33:22.612 --> 33:24.938
About three weeks
ago, I went up to Boston.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.139
What brought you up there?

33:28.866 --> 33:30.492
I was looking for you.

33:31.920 --> 33:37.396
While I was there, I bumped into
your old friend Henry Thain.

33:37.517 --> 33:40.302
Oh! Henry!

33:43.216 --> 33:45.753
How's he enjoying college life?

33:46.219 --> 33:50.143
He led me to the sleazy little
place where you used to deal drugs.

33:52.564 --> 33:57.376
I needed a way to get on
my feet, which I have, by the way.

33:57.979 --> 33:59.542
Doing quite well.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.399
I don't know what kind
of life you're living,

34:18.024 --> 34:26.777
but you're not fit to be a father.
I'm not going to let you see Catherine.

34:27.853 --> 34:31.938
That's her name?
How did you choose that?

34:32.058 --> 34:35.588
I'm not gonna let her meet you,
so you can just run off again.

34:35.952 --> 34:37.501
It would be cruel.

34:37.603 --> 34:39.161
I'm not running anywhere.

34:39.280 --> 34:43.120
Well, if you want to see her,
just convince me you've changed.

34:43.966 --> 34:50.232
Until then, come within 100 yards of her,
and I'll get a restraining order.

34:50.353 --> 34:52.663
I'm sorry that's your position.

34:54.454 --> 35:00.372
But... you have been taking care of
her, and-and I'm grateful for that.

35:03.987 --> 35:08.255
So, I guess I have to
respect your feelings.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.714
Can anyone hear me?!

35:32.710 --> 35:35.040
Can I please fucking
talk to someone?

36:30.848 --> 36:32.256
Miss Parsons?

36:33.170 --> 36:34.993
<i>Dean Gulickson from The Times.</i>

36:38.754 --> 36:40.319
<i>Have a seat.</i>

36:45.519 --> 36:47.662
<i>Thanks for agreeing
to talk to me about the case.</i>

36:47.761 --> 36:49.129
<i>I haven't agreed yet.</i>

36:49.513 --> 36:50.796
<i>I see.</i>

36:52.742 --> 36:54.858
<i>How often are
you in Afghanistan?</i>

36:54.963 --> 36:56.264
<i>Most of the year.</i>

36:58.972 --> 37:00.523
<i>The story I have--</i>

37:00.633 --> 37:03.847
<i>It goes way beyond just a civil
action against High Star.</i>

37:03.953 --> 37:05.571
<i>How far beyond?</i>

37:05.729 --> 37:10.058
<i>Extraordinary rendition, CIA, innocent
man being framed as a terrorist.</i>

37:11.224 --> 37:12.714
<i>That's pretty far.</i>

37:13.714 --> 37:16.991
<i>I can give you all of
it if you do something for me.</i>

37:17.130 --> 37:18.329
<i>I'm listening.</i>

37:18.501 --> 37:21.169
<i>There's a High
Star employee over there--</i>

37:21.277 --> 37:22.822
<i>Christopher Sanchez.</i>

37:22.946 --> 37:24.490
<i>And he's missing.</i>

37:25.499 --> 37:27.065
<i>Or he's been killed.</i>

37:28.252 --> 37:31.864
<i>Either way, I want
you to find him.</i>

37:33.032 --> 37:34.385
<i>What if I can't?</i>

37:35.738 --> 37:37.714
<i>Well, then you
don't get the story.</i>

37:41.398 --> 37:43.020
<i>- Trent Prowse.
- Howard Erickson.</i>

37:43.140 --> 37:46.495
<i>Hey, have you seen the mock-up
of the new Excalibur drone?</i>

37:46.593 --> 37:48.865
<i>It's got 400 pounds of
laser-guided munitions.</i>

37:48.953 --> 37:51.074
<i>It can hit a cabbage
from 600 miles away.</i>

37:51.165 --> 37:53.090
<i>It's still a few years
away from production, though.</i>

37:53.188 --> 37:55.515
<i>Yeah, well, I can't
wait to see that baby in action.</i>

37:55.613 --> 37:56.885
<i>You'll be among the first.</i>

37:56.969 --> 38:00.103
<i>Listen, I was talking to the secretary
about your expansion plan.</i>

38:00.187 --> 38:01.652
<i>He's confident you
can handle the job.</i>

38:01.743 --> 38:03.041
<i>Well, he's a smart man.</i>

38:03.126 --> 38:05.287
<i>Provided you're able to stick
to your construction schedule.</i>

38:05.416 --> 38:06.984
<i>Yeah, no problem doing that.</i>

38:07.070 --> 38:11.084
<i>Listen, um, I actually called
you up to ask you for a favor.</i>

38:11.174 --> 38:12.481
<i>Yeah?
What can I do for you?</i>

38:12.566 --> 38:15.364
<i>I was wondering if we could
discuss some troop deployments.</i>

38:15.490 --> 38:16.865
<i>What do you have in mind?</i>

38:22.551 --> 38:23.706
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

38:23.802 --> 38:25.951
<i>It's a record of Mr.
Marwat's activities.</i>

38:26.053 --> 38:28.195
<i>You'll see that he's being
well taken care of.</i>

38:28.286 --> 38:29.906
<i>That's not what we asked for.</i>

38:32.493 --> 38:34.983
<i>This is a lunch menu.
"8:00 a.m., breakfast.</i>

38:35.063 --> 38:38.299
<i>Mr. Marwat is given oatmeal,
scrambled eggs and a pineapple</i>

38:38.416 --> 38:40.766
<i>juice, attested to by
Guard Frank Bishop."</i>

38:40.860 --> 38:43.850
<i>It's a daily record of all
his meals, his exercise time.</i>

38:43.973 --> 38:46.051
<i>You'll see he's allowed to
pray five times a day.</i>

38:46.158 --> 38:48.667
<i>That is not the
information we asked for.</i>

38:49.611 --> 38:52.265
<i>We need to know which
organizations are questioning</i>

38:52.351 --> 38:56.424
<i>him, how long the interrogations last,
and what methods are being used.</i>

38:56.510 --> 38:57.712
<i>You know that's classified.</i>

38:57.806 --> 38:59.129
<i>We can't give that to you.</i>

38:59.229 --> 39:01.700
<i>Well, this is useless.</i>

39:01.785 --> 39:03.511
<i>I'm afraid that's
all I'm able to provide.</i>

39:03.595 --> 39:05.026
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Parsons.</i>

39:13.941 --> 39:15.392
<i>Everything we need in there?</i>

39:16.286 --> 39:19.039
<i>Yeah.
This should do it.</i>

39:23.152 --> 39:25.043
<i>Courtesy of the
Dominican Republic.</i>

39:25.136 --> 39:29.815
<i>Everybody talks about the Cubans, but the
Dominicans make the superior cigar.</i>

39:32.136 --> 39:33.689
<i>- No, thank you.
- You sure?</i>

39:33.823 --> 39:36.086
<i>I'm sure.</i>

39:42.574 --> 39:44.445
<i>What can I do for you, Ed?</i>

39:45.855 --> 39:50.946
<i>My grandson's unit has
been reassigned to Afghanistan.</i>

39:52.313 --> 39:54.969
<i>The Arghandab Valley.</i>

39:55.293 --> 39:56.672
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

39:57.461 --> 40:00.584
<i>I know how much you and your
daughter were afraid of that.</i>

40:01.425 --> 40:03.680
<i>You got him sent
over there, didn't you?</i>

40:14.664 --> 40:16.817
<i>Of course, it
might be good for him.</i>

40:17.550 --> 40:23.933
<i>Combat changes a man.
Deepens him.</i>

40:24.928 --> 40:28.993
<i>From the minute he wakes up in the morning,
he knows that day could be his last.</i>

40:31.268 --> 40:32.586
<i>Heightens the senses.</i>

40:32.700 --> 40:38.021
<i>I'm asking you, man to man...
did you have my grandson sent there?</i>

40:38.123 --> 40:41.737
<i>On the other hand,
I wouldn't want any of</i>

40:41.839 --> 40:43.601
<i>my sons over there right now.</i>

40:43.702 --> 40:47.409
<i>That particular area is getting
more dangerous by the day.</i>

40:47.497 --> 40:49.200
<i>Cut the crap, Howard!</i>

40:51.702 --> 40:56.898
<i>Place is crawling with snipers...
IED's, RPG's.</i>

40:57.413 --> 41:00.621
<i>Hell, I heard things are so
confused over there right now,</i>

41:00.696 --> 41:03.288
<i>some of our boys are getting
hit with friendly fire.</i>

41:07.307 --> 41:10.182
<i>Are you saying
what I think you're saying?</i>

41:13.320 --> 41:18.797
<i>This is a war, Ed.
Anything is possible.</i>

41:20.507 --> 41:23.158
<i>I really think you
should consider that.</i>

41:24.965 --> 41:30.425
<i>What good is a piece of land if you
have no family to share it with?</i>

41:31.725 --> 41:33.909
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

41:38.061 --> 41:40.988
<i>My answer is... yes...</i>

41:43.977 --> 41:46.985
<i>I did get your grandson
sent over there.</i>

41:48.146 --> 41:50.221
<i>And I can pull him out.</i>

41:52.954 --> 41:54.594
<i>It's up to you.</i>

42:01.999 --> 42:03.433
<i>Thank you for meeting with us.</i>

42:04.832 --> 42:06.618
<i>We were given a list of Mr.
Marwat's daily</i>

42:06.706 --> 42:09.913
<i>activities, and of all the guards
posted to his detail, you</i>

42:10.003 --> 42:12.352
<i>seem to be the one who had
the most contact with him.</i>

42:12.472 --> 42:14.454
Uh... yeah, probably.

42:14.759 --> 42:16.862
<i>We believe Mr.
Marwat is innocent.</i>

42:16.972 --> 42:22.044
<i>And the man that framed him for the
crime is in one of these photographs.</i>

42:28.225 --> 42:31.515
<i>Has anyone from these pictures
come to talk to Mr. Marwat?</i>

42:31.613 --> 42:35.209
<i>Do you... recognize anybody?
Take your time.</i>

42:35.297 --> 42:40.398
<i>No, I-I don't
recognize these people. No.</i>

42:41.838 --> 42:44.164
<i>You work the day shift,
8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., is that right?</i>

42:44.258 --> 42:45.631
<i>- That's right.
- Would you be willing</i>

42:45.703 --> 42:49.384
<i>to take in these photographs to Mr.
Marwat... give him a chance</i>

42:49.463 --> 42:53.373
<i>to identify the man that
we're looking for?</i>

42:54.596 --> 42:56.131
<i>Are you nuts?</i>

42:56.953 --> 42:59.616
<i>You want me to
bring this to a terror suspect?</i>

42:59.776 --> 43:03.042
- <i>- You'd be compensated.
- Whose side do you think I'm on?</i>

43:03.564 --> 43:07.083
<i>Anyway, I get frisked every
day when I go to work.</i>

43:07.249 --> 43:09.790
<i>I get caught with these
on me, I'll lose my job.</i>

43:11.458 --> 43:13.428
<i>Just meeting with you
could get me jammed up.</i>

43:13.535 --> 43:15.303
<i>Then why did you agree to it?</i>

43:15.980 --> 43:19.711
<i>You're the only guard who
would speak to us. Why?</i>

43:19.822 --> 43:22.401
<i>I guess, uh, the
others aren't as stupid.</i>

43:22.513 --> 43:25.424
<i>Or is something about this
not sitting quite right with you?</i>

43:26.816 --> 43:29.253
<i>Have you spoken to Mr. Marwat?</i>

43:31.771 --> 43:34.140
<i>A little, sure.</i>

43:34.253 --> 43:35.195
<i>In your experience,</i>

43:35.296 --> 43:38.227
<i>does he behave like someone who
could possibly be a terrorist?</i>

43:41.582 --> 43:42.679
<i>I gotta go.</i>

43:42.779 --> 43:48.137
<i>Mr. Asgari... if anyone from these
pictures comes to talk to Nasim...</i>

43:49.402 --> 43:51.744
<i>please, just let us know.</i>

43:58.545 --> 43:59.574
Excuse me, sir.

43:59.706 --> 44:01.588
<i>I'm here to see Marwat, Nasim.</i>

44:40.862 --> 44:43.749
<i>Six fuckin' letters.</i>

44:51.100 --> 44:52.742
<i>Hey, Asgari.</i>

44:53.171 --> 44:54.987
<i>Hey, Tommy, stay out
of trouble, huh?</i>

44:56.515 --> 44:57.661
<i>You're late.</i>

44:57.810 --> 45:00.162
<i>Eh, two minutes.
Had to make a pit stop.</i>

45:05.201 --> 45:06.750
<i>I still can't find this bitch.</i>

45:06.856 --> 45:08.496
<i>All I know is the
second letter's a "U."</i>

45:21.967 --> 45:23.166
<i>"Cupcake."</i>

45:23.262 --> 45:25.470
<i>Nah, seven letters.
Doesn't fit.</i>

45:36.185 --> 45:38.236
<i>I need to speak
to the detainee.</i>

45:38.494 --> 45:39.706
<i>Good to see you again, sir.</i>

45:39.932 --> 45:41.058
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:49.180 --> 45:51.703
<i>"Muffin.
" 17 across, it's "muffin."</i>

45:51.799 --> 45:54.491
<i>Shh! Quiet, man, the
prisoner is being questioned.</i>

45:55.211 --> 45:56.534
<i>Sorry.</i>

46:28.763 --> 46:31.912
<i>"Muffin.
" "Muffin" fits.</i>

46:32.611 --> 46:34.489
<i>This is the guy.
He came to see Mr. Marwat.</i>

46:34.584 --> 46:35.299
<i>Are you sure?</i>

46:35.402 --> 46:37.202
<i>Definitely.
I saw him last night.</i>

46:37.304 --> 46:40.033
<i>Thank you so much.
You'll be compensated, as promised.</i>

46:40.117 --> 46:42.017
<i>Keep the money; I just
hope I'm right about this.</i>

46:42.099 --> 46:43.228
<i>You are. He's innocent.</i>

46:43.311 --> 46:44.743
<i>Then get him out of there.</i>

46:49.607 --> 46:50.664
<i>How's the weight?</i>

46:50.793 --> 46:54.216
<i>You know, I don't hunt
very much, so it's hard to say.</i>

46:54.311 --> 46:56.167
<i>Well, you could use a .22,
but since we're walking</i>

46:56.258 --> 46:59.267
<i>rabbits, that shotgun'll make it
easier for you to snap shoot.</i>

46:59.363 --> 47:00.358
<i>Right.</i>

47:03.335 --> 47:04.753
<i>Any word on
flight restrictions?</i>

47:04.834 --> 47:08.474
<i>I'm in contact with the
FAA as to fixed-wing aircraft,</i>

47:08.553 --> 47:10.142
<i>but helicopters are no problem.</i>

47:10.230 --> 47:11.700
<i>Good, good.</i>

47:11.774 --> 47:13.294
<i>Nice piece of property.</i>

47:13.372 --> 47:14.778
<i>She'll make a
beautiful compound.</i>

47:15.910 --> 47:17.770
<i>What changed O'Malley's mind?</i>

47:17.880 --> 47:20.230
<i>He wanted to do his
part for the war effort.</i>

47:20.715 --> 47:24.163
<i>Some people, Jack, you give them enough
time, eventually they'll see the light.</i>

47:27.241 --> 47:29.815
<i>We have a face;
now we need a name.</i>

47:30.095 --> 47:31.942
<i>I'll call Bill,
see if he can help us.</i>

47:32.102 --> 47:34.102
<i>Ms. Hewes,
this came for you.</i>

47:48.430 --> 47:49.597
<i>What is it?</i>

47:51.306 --> 47:52.814
<i>A summons.</i>

47:53.390 --> 47:56.372
<i>Michael's suing me for
custody of Catherine.</i>

48:00.586 --> 48:02.654
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

48:06.031 --> 48:08.299
<i>Anyone?
I just want to fuckin' talk!</i>

48:08.457 --> 48:09.875
<i>I just want to talk!</i>

48:10.969 --> 48:13.366
<i>Open the fuckin' door!</i>

48:13.744 --> 48:15.390
<i>Can we please talk?</i>

48:50.246 --> 48:51.495
<i>Thy kingdom come,</i>

48:51.571 --> 48:54.516
<i>Thy will be done on earth
as it is in Heaven.</i>

48:54.731 --> 48:57.424
<i>Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our</i>

48:57.502 --> 49:01.733
<i>trespasses... as we forgive
those who trespass against us.</i>
