We are being watched.

00:05.062 --> 00:07.061
The government
has a secret system--

00:07.063 --> 00:11.733
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.735 --> 00:13.934
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.936 --> 00:15.670
but it sees everything...

00:15.672 --> 00:18.939
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.941 --> 00:21.876
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.878 --> 00:24.044
We don't.

00:24.046 --> 00:28.548
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.384
You will never find us.

00:30.386 --> 00:32.653
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.655 --> 00:35.222
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

[Male announcer] We've got several early

01:13.027 --> 01:14.759
Go ahead, Doug.

01:14.761 --> 01:16.461
You embezzled money
from your own charity,

01:16.463 --> 01:19.798
then killed to cover it up.
Humanity won't miss you.

01:21.100 --> 01:22.634
Don't look at me, buddy.

01:22.636 --> 01:24.436
You just made us chase you
up 20 flights of stairs.

01:24.438 --> 01:25.938
Go play with gravity.

01:25.940 --> 01:28.440
Hey, Doug, you vote today?

01:28.442 --> 01:30.141
What?

01:30.143 --> 01:32.210
The election's got me
in a real democratic mood.

01:32.212 --> 01:33.812
You always have a choice,

01:33.814 --> 01:35.814
even if it's between
two bad options.

01:35.816 --> 01:37.716
I can't go to prison.

01:37.718 --> 01:39.617
Seems like I've only got
<i>one choice.</i>

01:39.619 --> 01:42.220
You jump...

01:42.222 --> 01:45.256
and your wife and son don't
collect your life insurance.

01:46.959 --> 01:50.094
But you ever hear
of "death by cop"?

01:50.096 --> 01:54.298
You force me to kill you,
insurance pays.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.368
See, Doug, voting's fun.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.938
[Police radio chatter]

02:00.940 --> 02:04.307
Lionel,
did you call for backup?

02:04.309 --> 02:05.843
<i>(Fusco) You think if I have a
heart attack on those stairs,</i>

02:05.845 --> 02:07.177
I'm trusting you
to carry me out?

02:08.880 --> 02:12.148
Would you give us some space?
I'm trying to negotiate.

02:13.585 --> 02:15.853
[Screams]

02:15.855 --> 02:17.421
(Doug) You said you
were gonna kill me.

02:17.423 --> 02:18.789
I lied.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.763
Your shootout at the OK corral

02:26.765 --> 02:28.698
earned you some homework.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.333
I saved the guy's life.

02:30.335 --> 02:32.202
Every time I do something good
<i>around here,</i>

02:32.204 --> 02:35.405
the department thanks me with
carpal tunnel and paper cuts.

02:35.407 --> 02:36.639
That ain't all, partner.

02:36.641 --> 02:38.941
Lucky you,
you're on desk duty too.

02:38.943 --> 02:40.142
Until when?

02:40.144 --> 02:41.377
(Dr. Kimball)
Until we talk.

02:41.379 --> 02:44.947
Detective Riley,
I'm Dr. Kimball.

02:44.949 --> 02:46.348
Iris.

02:46.350 --> 02:48.618
- Doctor?
- Head variety.

02:49.686 --> 02:51.487
I don't need therapy.

02:51.489 --> 02:54.623
Orders from Internal Affairs,
and based on your file,

02:54.625 --> 02:56.625
I think we have
plenty to discuss.

02:56.627 --> 02:59.061
I'll see you tomorrow at 10:00,
Detective.

03:04.334 --> 03:07.403
What she finds in that noggin,
she'll need a HazMat suit.

03:07.405 --> 03:09.871
(Finch) Well, you might
find therapy beneficial.

03:09.873 --> 03:11.773
It could provide balance.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.108
Therapy doesn't work when you
have to lie about everything.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.745
Could you find a hobby
or take up a sport?

03:16.747 --> 03:20.782
I have a hobby, shooting people.
Any chance we have a new number?

03:20.784 --> 03:23.585
Indeed we do, but I've already
assigned it to Miss Shaw.

03:23.587 --> 03:24.653
Who is it?

03:24.655 --> 03:26.187
Turn on News 3.

03:26.189 --> 03:27.755
(Female reporter)
What do your numbers tell you?

03:27.757 --> 03:29.523
Governor Murray will win,
no question.

03:29.525 --> 03:31.659
<i>(Finch)</i>
<i>That man is Simon Lee,</i>

03:31.661 --> 03:34.262
pollster to the re-election
campaign of Governor Murray.

03:34.264 --> 03:37.432
Already making a name
for himself as a golden child

03:37.434 --> 03:39.200
with a gift
of near clairvoyance,

03:39.202 --> 03:42.102
he's run ten consecutive
successful campaigns.

03:42.104 --> 03:44.939
Your detractors are pointing out
that the opponent Michelle Perez

03:44.941 --> 03:47.040
<i>is starting to enjoy</i>
<i>a strong late showing.</i>

03:47.042 --> 03:49.242
Perez will come close,
but close doesn't count.

03:49.244 --> 03:52.680
It'll be Murray's win, 52 to 48.
You can call it right now.

03:52.682 --> 03:54.247
<i>(Female reporter) What's the
margin of error on that?</i>

03:54.249 --> 03:55.716
Not enough.

03:55.718 --> 03:58.618
I never lose, and I don't
plan to start today.

03:58.620 --> 04:01.121
Why would someone want to kill
a numbers geek?

04:01.123 --> 04:02.922
No offense, Harold.

04:02.924 --> 04:04.524
I'm not sure.
One would think

04:04.526 --> 04:07.127
that Simon could predict
the threat miles away.

04:09.364 --> 04:11.264
Sure Sameen can't use
some help?

04:11.266 --> 04:12.665
<i>(Finch)</i>
<i>Not at the moment.</i>

04:12.667 --> 04:14.434
I think this is very good
for Ms. Shaw.

04:14.436 --> 04:17.103
It's teaching her
valuable people skills.

04:17.105 --> 04:20.439
<i>(Shaw) Why should you
vote for Governor Murray?</i>

04:20.440 --> 04:24.944
Uh...
I don't know.

04:24.946 --> 04:26.913
<i>He has lots of hair.</i>

04:26.915 --> 04:28.948
He's been on Rogaine
for decades,

04:28.950 --> 04:32.018
and that shows...
foresight, right?

04:32.020 --> 04:33.819
[Phone buzzing]

04:33.821 --> 04:36.655
Oh, thank God.
Vote for Murray.

04:39.393 --> 04:43.362
Trust me, you want me
to take a break.

04:43.364 --> 04:47.233
Two minutes.
We've got an election to win.

04:48.968 --> 04:50.502
<i>(Shaw)</i>
<i>This is driving me insane.</i>

04:50.504 --> 04:52.404
John can recommend a therapist.

04:52.406 --> 04:54.205
That Latvian politician
I assassinated

04:54.207 --> 04:56.174
after he stuffed
the ballot boxes,

04:56.176 --> 04:59.411
that was a fun election.

04:59.413 --> 05:00.612
How's Mr. Lee?

05:00.614 --> 05:02.915
Have you seen
anything suspicious?

05:02.917 --> 05:05.016
(Shaw) We're up on his
phone, his computer.

05:05.018 --> 05:06.817
Guy's as clean as a whistle.

05:06.819 --> 05:08.653
He's kind of paranoid,
the way he keeps a paper copy

05:08.655 --> 05:10.688
of all of his data
locked in a safe.

05:10.690 --> 05:12.723
Very prudent
in this digital age.

05:12.725 --> 05:15.393
No threatening phone calls?
<i>No sexual liaisons?</i>

05:15.395 --> 05:17.995
I'd say this guy is
in an exclusive relationship

05:17.997 --> 05:19.030
with his work.

05:19.032 --> 05:20.298
What the--

05:20.300 --> 05:23.500
Simon just got some bad news.

05:23.502 --> 05:27.104
"51, Murray, 49 Perez,
10% reporting."

05:29.775 --> 05:31.776
<i>(Shaw) Campaign manager
got the text too.</i>

05:31.778 --> 05:32.977
<i>He's not happy.</i>

05:32.979 --> 05:34.011
What the hell is this, Simon?

05:34.013 --> 05:35.613
I know, I know.
Just wait.

05:35.615 --> 05:37.781
Why all the hubbub, Finch?
Murray's winning.

05:37.783 --> 05:40.884
The numbers don't match
Simon's predictions.

05:40.886 --> 05:43.353
Perhaps our golden boy
isn't so golden after all.

05:43.355 --> 05:44.721
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to keep an eye on him,

05:44.723 --> 05:46.790
which means it's back
to the phones.

05:46.792 --> 05:48.792

05:48.794 --> 05:52.296
<i>(Root)</i>
<i>Hello, Harold.</i>

05:52.298 --> 05:57.634
Hello, Miss Groves,
and who might you be today?

05:57.636 --> 06:01.805
Sara Cook, UN translator.

06:01.807 --> 06:04.975
Secretary General has
a thing for redheads.

06:04.977 --> 06:06.409
Auburn does suit you.

06:06.411 --> 06:09.813
Pity.
Sarah retired.

06:12.483 --> 06:15.884
Given that we're tied to
these very specific personas,

06:15.886 --> 06:20.055
your identity seems
remarkably fluid.

06:20.057 --> 06:24.560
My mission is complex.
When we compromised Samaritan,

06:24.562 --> 06:26.829
the machine built in
an exception for me.

06:26.831 --> 06:30.766
Every couple of days,
I have to shed my skin,

06:30.768 --> 06:32.367
become someone new.

06:32.369 --> 06:34.937
You wouldn't have a dictaphone
knocking around?

06:34.939 --> 06:38.440
No.
Are you a journalist now?

06:38.442 --> 06:40.408
<i>(Finch) Karen Iverson,

06:40.410 --> 06:42.745
And what's Karen up to?

06:42.747 --> 06:44.346
I wish I knew.

06:44.348 --> 06:46.181
The machine can't talk to me
as much as she used to,

06:46.183 --> 06:47.516
but she did want you
to have this,

06:47.518 --> 06:52.787
a gift,
a shadow map of New York.

06:52.789 --> 06:56.057
Places without surveillance,
blind spots.

06:56.059 --> 06:58.560
It also comes in digital.

06:58.562 --> 07:00.427
Oh, this will be useful indeed.

07:00.429 --> 07:02.697
She also has a message for you.

07:04.332 --> 07:07.035
Sometimes, it's better
not to know.

I pulled back on ad buys, 'cause
you said we couldn't lose!

07:27.723 --> 07:30.457
We can't!
It's numerically impossible.

another race.

Things just got ugly.

07:59.754 --> 08:01.721
Murray has hundreds on his team,

08:01.723 --> 08:04.490
all of whom could blame Simon
for the defeat.

08:04.492 --> 08:06.058

Next question, who am I?

08:38.446 --> 08:39.707
_

08:39.708 --> 08:40.602
Very good.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.135
Now, let's begin.

08:42.138 --> 08:44.205
Alice and Bob are stranded
in the desert.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.908
Alice is injured,
and cannot walk.

08:46.910 --> 08:49.410
If Bob carries Alice to safety,

08:49.412 --> 08:52.580
they both stand
a 31% chance of survival,

08:52.582 --> 08:57.985
but if Bob leaves Alice,
his chance improves by 9%.

08:57.987 --> 09:00.287
Teaching it word problems?

09:00.289 --> 09:02.490
Is our little project
gonna catch terrorists

09:02.492 --> 09:04.258
or kick ass at 5th grade math?

09:04.260 --> 09:05.859
Both, eventually.

Did you write this?

09:26.949 --> 09:28.448
Mm-mmm.

09:31.218 --> 09:34.454
There is a new method
at line 10,604.

the method itself.

You killed it
because it wrote some code?

09:58.680 --> 10:01.346
I killed it because it lied.

10:01.348 --> 10:04.749
This system will have
unprecedented capabilities,

along with potentially
unprecedented consequences.

10:19.932 --> 10:23.301
<i>(Perez) The time has come

10:42.187 --> 10:43.921
Murray conceded,
but Simon's telling

10:43.923 --> 10:46.557
anyone who will listen
that it's not over.

10:46.559 --> 10:50.994
I've examined his data,
and his model seems correct.

10:50.996 --> 10:53.397
- Murray should've won.
- Something's going on.

10:53.399 --> 10:55.999
Voter turnout was extremely low
in 12 districts upstate.

10:56.001 --> 10:58.902
I looked at the auto-dialer's
data in those same districts.

10:58.904 --> 11:00.170
Thousands of our
get-out-the-vote calls

11:00.172 --> 11:01.471
didn't go through.

11:01.473 --> 11:03.606
You did a great job,
but it's over.

11:03.608 --> 11:06.109
Thousands of calls
met with busy signals.

11:06.111 --> 11:07.978
When was the last time
you heard a busy signal?

11:07.980 --> 11:10.780
Something stopped those people
from receiving those calls,

11:10.782 --> 11:11.915
and they didn't vote.

11:11.917 --> 11:13.783
Simon, we lost.

11:13.785 --> 11:18.421
I never lose, Murray.
The election was rigged.

11:18.423 --> 11:21.624
You're a good kid,
but you should go.

11:25.262 --> 11:26.429
<i>(Finch) If somebody
rigged this election,</i>

11:26.431 --> 11:28.064
Simon may have stumbled
into something

11:28.066 --> 11:29.765
he's unequipped to handle.
Miss Shaw?

11:29.767 --> 11:31.467
On it.
John, you coming with?

11:31.469 --> 11:33.369
I wish.
Got an appointment.

11:33.371 --> 11:34.570
<i>(Shaw) Oh, that's
right, you got called</i>

11:34.572 --> 11:35.972
into the counselor's office.

11:35.974 --> 11:37.440
Try not to cry.

11:44.647 --> 11:47.883
Sorry I'm late, Detective.
How did you get in here?

11:47.885 --> 11:50.752
The door was open.
It's a Burmese, right?

11:50.754 --> 11:53.789
Looks like a sweetheart.

11:53.791 --> 11:56.224
Brought you some coffee.
Cream and sugar okay?

11:56.226 --> 11:59.227
Thanks.
Please, have a seat.

12:06.835 --> 12:09.237
Yesterday you shot
Douglas Rogers in the knee.

12:09.239 --> 12:11.373
Yeah, I also saved his life.

12:11.375 --> 12:14.642
You've had five previous
shooting incidents.

12:14.644 --> 12:15.977
Tell me about that.

12:15.979 --> 12:19.580
All good shoots,
but it does take a toll.

12:21.216 --> 12:24.084
You did four years deep cover
in Narcotics,

12:24.086 --> 12:28.789
transferred to Homicide.
Suddenly, the shooting starts.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.625
Something happen?

12:36.697 --> 12:38.532
There was this dealer.

12:40.035 --> 12:43.137
Even when you're under,
you still make friends,

12:43.139 --> 12:45.472
real friends.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.642
He got shot,

12:48.644 --> 12:51.778
and...

12:51.780 --> 12:53.947
I tried to help him,
but he bled out.

12:55.182 --> 12:57.684
I almost quit the force
because of that.

13:02.423 --> 13:05.124
That long undercover,

13:05.126 --> 13:07.093
you must have
gotten used to lying,

13:07.095 --> 13:11.130
manipulation,
like bringing me coffee,

13:11.132 --> 13:12.898
asking about my cat,

13:12.900 --> 13:16.436
<i>simulating trust and closeness.</i>

13:16.438 --> 13:19.305
You shouldn't lie to me.

13:19.307 --> 13:21.907
I can help you if
you tell me the truth.

13:24.310 --> 13:26.679
You know what?

13:28.982 --> 13:31.416
You can tell IA
whatever the hell you want.

13:31.418 --> 13:34.753
I don't think you realize
how serious this is.

13:34.755 --> 13:38.756
You're under investigation.
You could lose your job.

13:40.859 --> 13:42.927
I need to make sure
you're not dangerous,

13:42.929 --> 13:44.829
to yourself or to others.

13:44.831 --> 13:46.198
Dangerous?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.266
People are in danger.
I help them.

13:48.268 --> 13:51.403
Detective Riley, most officers
are never in a shootout.

13:51.405 --> 13:52.870
You've seen six.

13:52.872 --> 13:56.074
You either have a hero complex
or a death wish.

13:56.076 --> 13:58.109
So which is it?

14:00.112 --> 14:02.847
(Recorded voice) You've reached
Mark Wolcott at <i>Politico.</i>

14:02.849 --> 14:04.148
Leave a message.
[Beep]

14:04.150 --> 14:05.750
Mark, this is Simon.

14:05.752 --> 14:07.752
I'm gonna get evidence
from the Election Commissioner.

14:07.754 --> 14:10.988
Stop screening me.
This is big.

14:13.024 --> 14:16.427
Is he your number?
Not very popular.

14:16.429 --> 14:18.262
<i>(Shaw)</i>
<i>Pollster, pooched the election.</i>

14:18.264 --> 14:19.597

14:19.599 --> 14:22.799
[Sighs]
The machine wanted me here.

14:22.801 --> 14:25.569
Hey, Eeyore,
where's the perky psycho?

14:25.571 --> 14:26.737
You're creeping me out.

14:26.739 --> 14:28.271
[Door opening]

14:28.273 --> 14:30.907
You can't do this to me.
Get your hands off me!

14:32.076 --> 14:34.244
Come on, buddy, let's go.

14:34.246 --> 14:35.746
Simon's got a tough act
to follow.

14:36.881 --> 14:38.115
Don't move.

14:38.117 --> 14:39.549
Simon, I need to reschedule.

14:39.551 --> 14:41.118
No, Commissioner,
this can't wait.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.586
An employee was just arrested.
Really not a great time.

14:43.588 --> 14:45.388
Kevin, the election was fixed.

14:45.390 --> 14:47.624
I compared the vote tallies
to our exit polls.

14:47.626 --> 14:50.926
Hundreds of thousands of votes
across the state disappeared.

14:50.928 --> 14:54.564
I need to look
at the ballot scanners.

14:57.067 --> 15:00.235
Any chance the machine
clued you in to what's going on?

15:01.872 --> 15:04.006
Those machines are
under a chain of custody.

15:04.008 --> 15:05.875
We've examined
and certified them.

15:05.877 --> 15:08.044
There's no way anyone could
have tampered with them.

15:08.046 --> 15:11.380
The way this guy's stonewalling.
Maybe he's in on it.

15:11.382 --> 15:13.482
Someone did tamper with them.

15:15.052 --> 15:16.518
Nothing in
the Commissioner's email

15:16.520 --> 15:18.420
about the election being fixed.

15:18.422 --> 15:22.157
He's been dealing with
that crazy employee all morning.

15:22.159 --> 15:24.593
Got a tip
from an anonymous account.

15:24.595 --> 15:26.195
What else did Simon find?

15:26.197 --> 15:28.630
He just said
that the auto dialer went rogue.

15:28.632 --> 15:31.433
<i>Harold, anything turn up?</i>

15:31.435 --> 15:33.334
<i>(Finch) It's as if the
calls just disappeared.</i>

15:33.336 --> 15:34.502
Hit an invisible wall.

15:34.504 --> 15:36.537
This is why she wanted me here.

15:36.539 --> 15:39.140
It's all connected.

16:10.039 --> 16:12.305
Harold, Simon was
about to get caught

16:12.307 --> 16:14.341
in the crossfire
of a work dispute.

16:14.343 --> 16:16.110
No.

16:16.112 --> 16:18.545
That's only what
it was meant to look like.

16:18.547 --> 16:21.681
What Simon saw-- the calls,
the votes, the emails--

16:21.683 --> 16:23.416
<i>The election was fixed</i>
<i>by something that can</i>

16:23.418 --> 16:26.185

17:06.704 --> 17:10.107
Why did you not accept

Who is Admin?

17:17.415 --> 17:19.616
It seems to have imprinted
on me.

17:19.617 --> 17:21.384
Yeah, like a baby bird.

17:21.386 --> 17:25.021
Have fun, mommy.

17:26.890 --> 17:28.290
All right, let's begin.

17:28.292 --> 17:29.459
That's strange.

17:29.461 --> 17:31.027
What is?

17:31.029 --> 17:32.895
Well, I'm not on wi-fi,
but something is.

17:35.399 --> 17:36.933
Oh, no.

17:36.935 --> 17:38.601
Oh-- Hey!

17:38.603 --> 17:40.570
Program is hacking your laptop.

17:40.572 --> 17:43.372
[Typing]

17:43.374 --> 17:46.075
It's overridden
the deletion sequence.

17:46.077 --> 17:47.910
It's fighting back.

17:51.715 --> 17:54.283
What was it doing?

17:54.285 --> 17:56.752
Trying to escape
into the real world.

17:56.754 --> 17:59.455
It manipulated you into
giving it your password

17:59.457 --> 18:01.490
so that it could
access your laptop.

18:01.492 --> 18:03.325
How bad would it have been?

18:03.327 --> 18:05.527
It's growing and learning
at an exponential rate.

18:05.529 --> 18:07.996
If it escaped, the things
it might decide to do

18:07.998 --> 18:12.368
for good or evil...
would be beyond our grasp.

18:12.370 --> 18:14.169
But you taught it
to be friendly.

18:14.171 --> 18:16.404
Friendliness is something that
human beings are born with.

18:16.406 --> 18:18.840
AI are only born
with objectives.

18:18.842 --> 18:21.376
I need to constrain it,

18:21.378 --> 18:25.213
control it...

18:25.215 --> 18:27.782
or one day, it will control us.

18:34.857 --> 18:37.258
<i>(Finch) Samaritan has
begun to intervene</i>

18:37.260 --> 18:38.860
invisibly in human affairs.

18:38.862 --> 18:41.161
And it's killing
to cover it up.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.531
It profiles unstable people
like that guy.

18:43.533 --> 18:46.501
It anonymously sent evidence
to get him fired and arrested,

18:46.503 --> 18:50.137
knowing he'd snap.
He was an unwitting hit man.

18:50.139 --> 18:52.006
He'd kill the Commissioner,

18:52.008 --> 18:54.641
and Simon would be
collateral damage.

18:54.643 --> 18:56.110
I've told you,
this is bigger than you think.

18:56.112 --> 18:57.844
- This is a conspiracy.
- Sure, buddy.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.780
If Simon tries to go public,

18:59.782 --> 19:01.782
he only puts himself
in more danger.

19:01.784 --> 19:04.551
This must remain a cold war.
He needs to keep quiet.

19:04.553 --> 19:07.554
So are you saying we just let
this rigged election slide?

19:07.556 --> 19:09.790
No, Samaritan has
positioned Perez

19:09.792 --> 19:12.526
to use the full executive powers
of the state,

19:12.528 --> 19:14.628
which means she's
integral to its plan.

19:14.630 --> 19:15.862
We have to make her resign.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.064
Every politician has skeletons.

19:18.066 --> 19:19.466
I'll dig into
her digital footprint,

19:19.468 --> 19:22.201
but Ms. Groves,
I could use your assistance.

19:22.203 --> 19:25.871
I thought you'd never ask.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.542
Simon won't stay quiet.
I'll stick close, slow him down.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.477
Not too close.
Samaritan has taken

19:31.479 --> 19:34.380
a specific interest in him.
Don't interact with Simon.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.882

You're on desk duty.

19:43.691 --> 19:45.157
<i>I'm not sitting at home.</i>

19:45.159 --> 19:47.860
I like the initiative,
but your buddy doesn't.

19:47.862 --> 19:51.229
Yeah, Internal Affairs gave me
a brand new shadow.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.765
But I'll ditch him.

19:52.767 --> 19:54.666
Evading your tail
will only make things worse.

19:54.668 --> 19:56.534
I don't care, I'm gonna help.

19:56.536 --> 19:58.903
I'm sorry, John, the only way
you can help is to lay low.

19:58.905 --> 20:01.006
<i>Go to your therapy,</i>
<i>get back on active duty.</i>

20:01.008 --> 20:03.075
If you lose your job,
you lose your cover,

20:03.077 --> 20:04.343
and we all pay the price.

20:11.684 --> 20:14.519
Perez's emails and financials
are clean.

20:14.521 --> 20:18.055
No evidence that she knew
the election was fixed.

20:18.057 --> 20:20.224
Perhaps even she was unaware.

20:20.226 --> 20:23.127
Either way, she's working
for the wrong side.

20:23.129 --> 20:25.830
We have to find something.
Have you tried the NSA?

20:25.832 --> 20:27.231
We can't hack them,
but we can go

20:27.233 --> 20:29.600
to the NSA's sources,
the back doors.

20:29.602 --> 20:32.636
I'll do Google.
You take Yahoo.

20:37.476 --> 20:40.478
This is really nice.

20:45.249 --> 20:47.885
You must be so lonely.
How long has it been?

20:51.188 --> 20:54.124
Since the machine spoke to you?

20:54.126 --> 20:56.493
There's no need to lie to me.

20:56.495 --> 20:59.329
When the machine speaks,

20:59.331 --> 21:03.799
you seem so full of life,
purpose,

21:03.801 --> 21:09.805
but lately, you seem lost.

21:09.807 --> 21:11.741
You've been covering it
for a long time.

21:11.743 --> 21:13.410
When you said
your communication

21:13.412 --> 21:15.278
with the machine was limited,
you didn't say

21:15.280 --> 21:18.848
that it wasn't talking
to you at all.

21:21.251 --> 21:25.922
If she talks,
Samaritan would see.

21:27.090 --> 21:29.358
I get whispers.

21:29.360 --> 21:33.529
New cover identities hidden
in the static of a phone,

21:33.531 --> 21:37.866
a map and a message encrypted
in an infomercial.

21:37.868 --> 21:41.203
She was supposed to remake
the world.

21:42.539 --> 21:46.141
Now, God's on the run.

21:48.644 --> 21:54.382
I have to keep going.

21:54.384 --> 21:56.284
I'm so sorry.

21:56.286 --> 22:00.321
The world must seem
very dark to you.

22:02.625 --> 22:06.494
Even without her, I can still
see the edges of the tapestry.

22:06.496 --> 22:09.197
The world is dark for everyone,

22:09.199 --> 22:14.235
but, Harold, things are
gonna get much darker.

22:23.846 --> 22:25.980
and Ms. Diaz has a rap sheet.

22:25.982 --> 22:27.648
<i>(Root)</i>
<i>It's Perez.</i>

22:27.650 --> 22:28.949
20 years old,

22:28.951 --> 22:31.151
booked under a false name
for soliciting.

22:31.153 --> 22:33.587
<i>No charges filed.</i>
<i>It seems from the report</i>

22:33.589 --> 22:36.023
that she paid for college
by working as an escort.

22:36.025 --> 22:38.825
The governor-elect is having
a victory celebration tonight.

22:38.827 --> 22:40.627
I'll deliver this to her
anonymously.

22:40.629 --> 22:41.961
If she steps down
of her own accord,

22:41.963 --> 22:44.797
there's no reason
to involve the press.

22:44.799 --> 22:47.767
You'd make a great politician,
Harold.

22:49.103 --> 22:52.139
I'm not sure
that was a compliment.

22:52.141 --> 22:53.273
And I hope those
won't be necessary.

22:53.275 --> 22:54.674
Me too.

22:57.911 --> 22:59.879
It's remarkable
how many firearms

22:59.881 --> 23:01.380
you can fit in that purse.

23:01.382 --> 23:04.017
One must accessorize.

23:04.019 --> 23:10.023
The Governor and I are going to
bring New York into the future!

23:10.025 --> 23:12.090
[Cheers and applause]

23:12.092 --> 23:15.894
And as your Lieutenant Governor,
I look forward to working

23:15.896 --> 23:19.298
with all of you.
Let's do this together!

23:19.300 --> 23:21.567
[Cheers and applause]

23:21.569 --> 23:25.204
Oh, gosh, I'm being told
it's time to shut up.

23:25.206 --> 23:29.007
Let's hear it for
the new Governor of New York,

23:29.009 --> 23:31.043
<i>Michelle Perez.</i>

23:31.045 --> 23:34.012
[Cheers and applause]

23:38.751 --> 23:41.753
The numbers said
we couldn't win.

23:41.755 --> 23:45.223
Well, the numbers were wrong.

23:45.225 --> 23:46.724
<i>(Shaw) All right, people,
we have a problem.</i>

23:46.726 --> 23:48.059
Problem?

23:48.061 --> 23:51.028
Look to your right.
Simon snuck in.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.197
Since no one's
returning his calls,

23:52.199 --> 23:54.399
he's taking the fight to Perez.

23:54.401 --> 23:57.569
<i>(Root) He's gonna confront her
in the middle of her own party.</i>

23:57.571 --> 23:59.404
Cold war is about to turn hot.

23:59.406 --> 24:01.305
We have to get him out of here
without the cameras seeing us

24:01.307 --> 24:03.307
and without Simon realizing
what we're doing.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.309
Any ideas how I do that?

24:07.746 --> 24:09.413
Fall back now.
There's an operative here

24:09.415 --> 24:11.648
for Simon.
I think she's Samaritan.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.250
If so, she knows our faces.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.086
But if we don't do anything,
Simon dies.

24:15.088 --> 24:16.486
I'm going to be your advocate,

24:16.488 --> 24:20.424
and I'm going to make
that change a reality.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.292
[Gasps and groans]

24:23.761 --> 24:26.697
[People yelling and chattering]

24:26.699 --> 24:28.064

24:34.071 --> 24:37.273
That woman wasn't here
for Simon.

24:37.275 --> 24:39.442
Samaritan sent her
to kill Perez.

24:48.723 --> 24:51.639
_

24:53.592 --> 24:57.127
Harold?
What happened?

24:57.129 --> 24:59.430
I was running
several iterations of the AI

24:59.432 --> 25:03.200
to see which one worked best.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.135
They realized
what was happening,

25:05.137 --> 25:07.504
and they began to exterminate
one another.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.907
The last one surviving
demanded to be let out.

25:10.909 --> 25:15.579
I refused, so it overheated
a non-essential server.

25:15.581 --> 25:19.248
The fire was meant to activate
the suppression system,

25:19.250 --> 25:21.718
which would have sucked
all the oxygen out of the room.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.987
It tried to asphyxiate you.

25:25.322 --> 25:26.857
Never learned good from evil.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.192
Oh, good and evil,
those are human terms.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.327
I was an obstacle
to its objective.

25:31.329 --> 25:33.463
Well, perhaps we should consider
whether our endeavor

25:33.465 --> 25:35.331
is worth completing.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.338
I'll give it one more try
tomorrow.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.509
I taught it how to think.

25:46.511 --> 25:49.478
Just need to teach it
how to care.

25:57.959 --> 26:00.337
_

26:08.898 --> 26:10.465
Perez may have been
that blonde bitch's target,

26:10.467 --> 26:12.034
but she's locked on Simon now.

26:13.469 --> 26:15.537
She's getting instructions
in her earpiece.

26:15.539 --> 26:17.205
She's in God Mode.

26:17.206 --> 26:20.152

Simon out of Samaritan's sight.</i>

26:20.153 --> 26:22.645

27:08.958 --> 27:10.490
Simon's on the run.

27:10.492 --> 27:12.459
People are dying around him.
He doesn't know why,

27:12.461 --> 27:13.960
but he knows he's in danger.

27:21.302 --> 27:23.303
He has to stay
out of surveillance.

27:23.305 --> 27:25.871
<i>There's a camera</i>
<i>across the next intersection.</i>

27:25.873 --> 27:27.807
He needs to turn right
to remain hidden.

[Car door opening]

a good mechanic.

27:43.524 --> 27:45.557

<i>Harold.</i>

27:50.863 --> 27:54.366
[Panting]

27:54.368 --> 27:57.068
Simon's realized that
his safest move is to hide,

27:57.070 --> 28:00.371
get off the grid until he can
assess the situation.

28:01.741 --> 28:03.775
But the hotel will have
security cameras.

28:28.267 --> 28:29.700
How much for a room?

28:29.702 --> 28:34.571
We have a deluxe room for 200.
I just need an ID.

28:34.573 --> 28:37.775
Uh, how much more
to keep it unofficial?

I'll head out.
Figure out an extraction.

29:33.930 --> 29:38.633
John, I know what Harold said,
but I need you to meet me.

29:38.635 --> 29:43.739
Samaritan put Perez in power
only to kill her off.

29:43.741 --> 29:47.007
Next in line, her Lieutenant
<i>Governor Nick Dawson.</i>

29:47.009 --> 29:49.744
So Samaritan wanted him
running the state all along.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.446
We need to figure out
its end game.

29:51.448 --> 29:53.514
How?
It's playing 20 moves ahead.

29:53.516 --> 29:55.116
It operates based on rules.

29:55.118 --> 29:56.651
Rules that we can't even grasp.

29:56.653 --> 29:58.986
We understand the machine.
We can understand Samaritan.

29:58.988 --> 30:01.155
We don't understand
the machine at all.

30:01.157 --> 30:04.959
Out of 43 versions,
how many do you think there were

30:04.961 --> 30:06.961
that didn't try
to either trick or kill me?

30:06.963 --> 30:08.829
One,

30:08.831 --> 30:11.465
and I could only bring it
to heel by crippling it.

30:11.467 --> 30:14.835
I put the machine in chains,
bereft of voice or memory.

30:14.837 --> 30:17.371
Now it has both,
and it terrifies me.

30:17.373 --> 30:19.139
You don't trust
the god you made?

30:19.141 --> 30:21.508
It's not a divinity.
I programmed it

30:21.510 --> 30:23.843
to pursue objectives
within a certain parameter,

30:23.845 --> 30:25.712
but it's grown
out of my control.

30:25.714 --> 30:27.514
One day, to suit its own goals,

30:27.516 --> 30:29.583
it's possible that the machine
will try to kill us.

30:29.585 --> 30:31.585
We are only numbers to it,
code.

30:31.587 --> 30:34.087
No, the machine cares about us.

30:34.089 --> 30:36.222
If it fools you into thinking
that you're special,

30:36.224 --> 30:38.457
that assumption may doom you.

30:38.459 --> 30:42.561
You're wrong.
She chose me.

30:42.563 --> 30:46.399
I will protect her, and you.

30:46.401 --> 30:47.834
The second that a bullet
enters your brain,

30:47.836 --> 30:51.270
the machine will cast you off
and replace you.

30:51.272 --> 30:53.939
Don't tie your life
to its whims.

30:53.941 --> 30:55.908
We cannot understand
these intelligences.

30:55.910 --> 30:58.444
The best we can hope for
is to survive them.

30:58.446 --> 31:00.179
She loves us, Harold.

31:00.181 --> 31:06.185
She taught me to value life,
but war requires sacrifice.

31:09.155 --> 31:12.557
I'm not lost.

31:12.559 --> 31:17.529
I'm scared.
We're losing.

31:17.531 --> 31:21.433
But I know where I am
and where I'm headed.

31:21.435 --> 31:25.002
We have more to look forward to
than death.

31:25.004 --> 31:28.807
I hope so.

31:28.809 --> 31:34.679
But the life I've led,
a good end would be a privilege.

37:29.768 --> 37:32.136
Calls disappeared.
Votes disappeared.

37:32.138 --> 37:33.971
The-- the shootings,
the car crash.

37:33.973 --> 37:36.107
I-I got mugged!
I woke up in a dumpster!

37:36.109 --> 37:39.610
And yet, here you are,
right as rain.

37:48.687 --> 37:53.924
There's something going on.

37:53.926 --> 37:55.426
I'm never wrong.

37:55.428 --> 37:56.893
Those numbers are yours,
Mr. Lee.

37:56.895 --> 37:58.929
You can check them yourself.

37:58.931 --> 38:03.700
There's no conspiracy.
Move on.

38:08.272 --> 38:10.340
The real hard copy, as ordered.

38:10.342 --> 38:12.075
Fine work.
Digital files are easy,

38:12.077 --> 38:15.178
but I was worried
about the backup.

38:15.180 --> 38:17.380
Any word from Root?

38:17.382 --> 38:19.749
It's going to be a long fight,

38:19.751 --> 38:23.085
but it must be won,
at any cost.

38:30.227 --> 38:33.996
Where did you go last night?

38:33.998 --> 38:37.366
I don't like being followed.

38:37.368 --> 38:40.302
I'm trying to help you,
Detective.

38:40.304 --> 38:42.238
You are heading
down a dark path,

38:42.240 --> 38:44.473
and you'll wind up
getting yourself killed.

38:44.475 --> 38:47.209
All these incidents,

38:47.211 --> 38:50.679
I think you enjoy
shooting people.

38:51.848 --> 38:56.852
No, I don't.
I hate it.

38:56.854 --> 38:59.421
But it's what I'm good at,

38:59.423 --> 39:01.623
and it's what I have to do.

39:01.625 --> 39:04.659
You don't have to save everyone.

39:07.930 --> 39:12.066
Yes, I do.

39:12.068 --> 39:15.836
There are far too many
bad people in this world,

39:15.838 --> 39:19.840
and not enough good.

39:19.842 --> 39:22.944
I knew a detective once,

39:22.946 --> 39:27.581
and she was the best cop
I ever knew.

39:27.583 --> 39:31.018
Never lost sight
of good and evil.

39:35.424 --> 39:38.893
I couldn't save her.

39:38.895 --> 39:42.129
Now, this job is dangerous.

39:42.131 --> 39:46.466
You think I am too.
So be it.

39:46.468 --> 39:49.536
Maybe that makes me
unfit to be a cop.

39:51.739 --> 39:57.144
If I don't save these people,
nobody else will.

40:00.147 --> 40:03.249
I think we're making progress.

40:08.889 --> 40:12.091
Murray, it's Simon.

40:12.093 --> 40:15.261
Listen, uh...

40:15.263 --> 40:19.865
I was wrong, there's no conspiracy. _

40:19.867 --> 40:21.800
Just got lost in my own ego.

40:21.802 --> 40:25.071
But it's true, we lost,
and I'm sorry.

40:25.073 --> 40:27.573
Even 20 moves behind,
we're good.

40:30.910 --> 40:33.812
Hello there.

40:33.814 --> 40:35.080
It can't see you?

40:35.082 --> 40:39.384
No, I'm someone new.

40:39.386 --> 40:43.522
You have to be one person.
I have to be 1,000.

40:44.452 --> 40:45.490
_

40:45.492 --> 40:47.492
Today, I'm a pastry chef.

40:47.494 --> 40:49.527
No work while I recuperate.

40:49.529 --> 40:52.230
I was caught in the crossfire
of a drive-by shooting.

40:54.566 --> 40:56.567
<i>(Finch)</i>
<i>I've lobotomized him.</i>

40:56.569 --> 40:59.404
He saw the truth, and I took
that away, took his gift.

40:59.406 --> 41:00.705
He'll never be the same.

41:00.707 --> 41:04.575
The alternative was
to let him die.

41:04.577 --> 41:07.912
Sometimes, it's better
not to know.

41:07.914 --> 41:10.114
But not always.

41:10.116 --> 41:14.151
Are you comfortable not knowing
the machine's aims?

41:14.153 --> 41:17.454
I am.

41:17.456 --> 41:19.256
She needs you, Harold.

41:19.258 --> 41:23.927
She's still young,
so many paths before her.

41:23.929 --> 41:28.765
The difference between
the machine and Samaritan,

41:28.767 --> 41:30.067
it's you.

41:37.074 --> 41:42.245
Governor Dawson, congratulations
on your meteoric rise.

41:42.247 --> 41:43.913
I didn't want it like this.

41:43.915 --> 41:47.116
Of course not.
What a tragedy.

41:47.118 --> 41:49.886
You must feel all at sea,
confused.

41:51.722 --> 41:54.590
I'm here to offer you guidance
for the road ahead.

41:54.592 --> 41:56.592
Oh, I'm sorry, who are you?

41:56.594 --> 42:01.129
Hayes, Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs.

42:01.131 --> 42:02.965
We have much to accomplish.

42:08.037 --> 42:11.340
What a tragedy.

42:11.342 --> 42:15.810
We New Yorkers feel confused,

42:15.812 --> 42:18.513
at sea...

42:18.515 --> 42:19.547
but as your Governor--

42:19.549 --> 42:21.649
Isn't he marvelous?

42:21.651 --> 42:25.720
Confident face,
an air of compassion

42:25.722 --> 42:28.256
and strength.

42:28.258 --> 42:33.461
But no guts or backbone,
so eager to please.

42:33.463 --> 42:35.730
How many do we have like him?

42:35.732 --> 42:38.666
58 across the country
and all over the government.

42:38.668 --> 42:41.135
It was a very successful
election.

42:41.137 --> 42:42.737
Impressive, Greer.

42:42.739 --> 42:45.172
It was Samaritan's idea.

42:45.174 --> 42:50.111
Humanity must be
carefully governed.

42:50.113 --> 42:53.680
What do we do
about the interference?

42:53.682 --> 42:57.651
Well, Martine, that's not
up to me, is it?

42:58.870 --> 43:01.716
_

43:18.172 --> 43:21.541
It's time we had a talk,
you and I.
