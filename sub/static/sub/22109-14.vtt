key to the trophy case.

01:01.233 --> 01:02.966
If we'd ever won a trophy,

01:03.002 --> 01:04.635
I would've turned the heck out of it.

01:04.670 --> 01:05.704
Mm.
_

01:05.704 --> 01:08.038
I can't believe you're retiring, sir.

01:09.508 --> 01:13.043
Martin, I must ask you to keep
secret what you just heard...

01:13.079 --> 01:15.312
the shocking news that I'm retiring.

01:15.347 --> 01:18.382
Sir, you are addressing
a student safety monitor.

01:18.417 --> 01:22.019
With diagonal belt comes
great responsibility.

01:22.054 --> 01:24.755
I've got a secret! Firsties!

What?!

01:34.633 --> 01:36.900
Skinner's quitting! I won the pool!

01:36.936 --> 01:39.503
Guess who's renting two
songs from iTunes!

01:39.538 --> 01:41.572
Skinner's retiring! Bombardment!

01:41.607 --> 01:43.273
He will be missed! Bombardment!

01:43.309 --> 01:45.909
He stood up for me when they
tried to ban bombardment!

01:45.945 --> 01:47.277
Bombardment!

01:48.614 --> 01:50.581
My fellow Americans, and Uter:
_

01:50.616 --> 01:52.082
the rumors... are true.

01:52.118 --> 01:53.650
I'm resigning the principality

01:53.686 --> 01:55.352
effective Taco Tuesday.

01:56.622 --> 01:58.822
Seymour, you will be missed.

02:01.460 --> 02:05.729
And now, the flyover by the
Permission Slip Angels.

02:08.234 --> 02:10.967
Ow! My distance-vision eye.

02:11.002 --> 02:13.904
Skinner leaving. One last
chance to honor him.

02:13.939 --> 02:16.173
With a shot to the head.

02:20.646 --> 02:23.614
Oh. Move it.

02:23.649 --> 02:26.316
Come on, Bart! Take the shot!

02:26.352 --> 02:28.385
I don't have the damn shot!

02:28.420 --> 02:30.754
Now, in honor of our
principal's retirement,

02:30.789 --> 02:33.090
we'll have a performance
from a super talent

02:33.125 --> 02:35.425
who's gonna wrap up our feelings.

There's a certain lack of elegance

02:53.546 --> 02:55.012
in rhyming karate with karate.

02:55.047 --> 02:56.246
Karate!

02:56.282 --> 02:57.814
Now, I'll share a fond farewell

02:57.850 --> 03:00.817
with one student chosen at
random to represent you all.

03:02.288 --> 03:04.574
Oh! Bart Simpson.

03:04.574 --> 03:07.991
There is a God, and his
name is the Devil.

03:08.027 --> 03:11.066
Bart, come forward.

03:11.730 --> 03:14.598
In the words of the late
David Bowie, né Jones:

No. Got you!

03:24.310 --> 03:25.742
Now, Willie! The honey!

03:35.521 --> 03:37.988
Simpson, I'm not retiring.

03:38.023 --> 03:40.524
This was all just a prank on you.

03:41.827 --> 03:44.228
Leave him alone!

03:48.601 --> 03:50.968
Where do I go? How do I live this down?

03:51.003 --> 03:54.238
Mom, my humiliation
bath is getting cold.

03:54.273 --> 03:57.040
Hold still. You've got
honey in your pits.

03:58.844 --> 04:00.877
Oh. Mm, sticky.

04:02.114 --> 04:04.248
Bombardment!

04:04.283 --> 04:06.316
Haw-haw!

04:06.352 --> 04:08.485
Oh, Nelsoned by Largo.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.921
I'll get them back.
I'll get them all back.

04:10.956 --> 04:13.390
And that'll be the end of it forever.

04:13.425 --> 04:16.260
Not good enough!
_

04:16.295 --> 04:19.029
_

04:19.064 --> 04:21.697
What are you gonna do, Bart?
Wait, wait, wait. Don't tell me.

04:21.733 --> 04:23.267
I'll have nightmares,

04:23.302 --> 04:26.065
like the one where I'm wearing
my pajamas during the daytime.

04:26.065 --> 04:27.871
You are wearing your pajamas.

04:27.906 --> 04:30.674
Some day I want to be a racecar driver.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.909
Do you know how many get killed?

04:32.945 --> 04:36.313
They don't show that on the pajamas!

04:50.396 --> 04:53.196
Ugh.

04:56.935 --> 04:58.468
Pranking Bart was my "Sergeant Peppers,"

04:58.504 --> 05:00.904
after a lifetime of
"Back Off Boogaloos."

05:00.939 --> 05:04.241
What the...? Simpson!
_

05:05.344 --> 05:07.244
Ugh!

05:07.279 --> 05:09.646
My skin!

05:15.120 --> 05:17.487
Hey, Brandine.

05:17.523 --> 05:20.924
These woods is filled
with scary white people.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.326
What else is new?

05:22.361 --> 05:23.660
Bait the traps.

05:23.696 --> 05:26.008
Mama needs a new people coat.

05:26.332 --> 05:28.932
Thanks to one vengeful
prankster, clowns...

05:28.967 --> 05:32.002
once a source of delight...
have now become more twisted

05:32.037 --> 05:35.439
than the balloon animals they
wrap their creepy hands around.

05:35.474 --> 05:37.741
We only hope that by showing it on TV,

05:37.776 --> 05:39.309
no one goes out and copies it.

05:39.345 --> 05:41.011
Now, let's tell you how it's done.

05:41.046 --> 05:42.612
Send your copycat videos

05:42.648 --> 05:46.516

We're doomed.

06:20.886 --> 06:22.652

How many times have I
told you not to wake me

06:25.324 --> 06:27.157
till it's two seconds to air?

06:27.192 --> 06:28.345
Krusty, I have to warn you.

06:28.345 --> 06:31.328
People's attitudes have changed about...

06:31.363 --> 06:33.997
Hey-hey, kids!

06:35.434 --> 06:37.467
Calm down, children. I'm here.

06:37.503 --> 06:40.237
The shirtless man with the
bone through his skull

06:40.272 --> 06:43.807
and a grass skirt with
nothing down under.

06:46.078 --> 06:48.245
I tried to warn you.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.880
People hate clowns now.

06:49.915 --> 06:51.815
And the advertisers
want to meet with you.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.390
_

06:57.399 --> 06:59.199
What is it with Bart and these pranks?

06:59.234 --> 07:01.001
- I don't get it.
- I don't know.

07:01.036 --> 07:02.435
Boys will be boys.

07:02.471 --> 07:03.970
That's another thing I don't get.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.173
What does that mean?
Spoons will be spoons.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.275
But they don't make you
go to juvenile court

07:08.310 --> 07:09.843
at 8:00 in the morning.

07:09.878 --> 07:11.845
Yo. If we hurry, we can get
those breakfast burritos

07:11.880 --> 07:14.214
- they serve at the courthouse.
- Those are good, Marge.

07:14.249 --> 07:15.849
Children's Court of Springfield
_

07:15.884 --> 07:17.384
is now in session.

07:17.419 --> 07:19.719
Apologies. Divorced dad, no sitter.

07:19.755 --> 07:21.855
That must be really tough, Judge.

07:21.890 --> 07:23.990
I raised a turtle by myself. Pure hell.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.459
Milhouse said he'd help,
and he just walked away.

07:26.495 --> 07:27.894
Let me look at your file, son.

07:27.930 --> 07:29.696
Your Honor, I can save you some time.

07:29.731 --> 07:32.499
I've done it all: juvie,
state juvie, groovy juvie,

07:32.534 --> 07:35.335
the Montessori prison,
Outward and Inward Bound.

07:35.370 --> 07:37.804
So you're down to fry me or free me.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.007
What can I say? I'm a widdle dickens.

07:45.514 --> 07:48.715
Well, Bart, based on the
ancient judicial principle

07:48.750 --> 07:50.784
"boys will be boys..."

07:50.819 --> 07:53.420
Mm-hmm.

07:53.455 --> 07:56.389
- I'm going to hand down a suspended...
- No!

07:56.425 --> 07:59.270
Marge, for once, let us
get rich people justice.

07:59.270 --> 08:03.530
No. Judge, I love my son, but
he's got a real problem.

08:03.565 --> 08:06.286
He needs to learn the
meaning of consequences.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.357
Huh?

08:08.770 --> 08:11.204
Bart, I sentence you to 28 days

08:11.240 --> 08:14.774
at the Tomorrow's New Horizons
Addiction Rehab Center

08:14.810 --> 08:17.444
and General Rotten Time Ranch.

08:19.548 --> 08:21.681
Mom, how could you do that to me?

08:21.717 --> 08:25.452
- Yeah, Mom.
- Because I love you, Bart.

08:25.487 --> 08:27.420
And a mother's toughest job is saying

08:27.456 --> 08:30.223
"Help me. My kid has a problem."

08:30.259 --> 08:33.293
I do not! All I ask is,
Dad, while I'm gone,

08:33.328 --> 08:35.428
will you hold onto my
can of peanut brittle?

08:35.464 --> 08:38.097
Anything for you, son.

08:38.133 --> 08:39.466
Snakes!

08:39.501 --> 08:41.467
Gotcha!

08:41.503 --> 08:43.068
Why you little...!

08:44.773 --> 08:48.275
Oh. The snakes ate
all the peanut brittle.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.110
I don't know.

08:50.145 --> 08:52.312
I don't know if I did the right thing.

08:52.347 --> 08:53.914
Comfort me.

08:53.949 --> 08:57.117
Oh, Marge, part of being
a parent is doing things

08:57.152 --> 08:59.753
that'll make your child
never speak to you again.

09:01.356 --> 09:03.456
Oh, no, honey, I didn't mean "never."

09:03.492 --> 09:05.225
Definitely on his deathbed.

09:06.929 --> 09:08.428
When he's dying.

09:08.463 --> 09:10.163
Oh!

09:10.198 --> 09:13.133
I had to do it. I had to do it.

09:13.168 --> 09:15.869
He was out of control.
Look what he did to Krusty.

09:15.999 --> 09:18.373
_

09:18.373 --> 09:20.674
I feel terrible for his writers.

09:22.010 --> 09:23.176
I beat you

09:23.211 --> 09:24.344
if you don't flip sign.

09:24.379 --> 09:26.646
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip!

09:30.452 --> 09:34.087
What are you here for? To laugh at me?

09:34.122 --> 09:36.356
- No.
- Please laugh at me!

09:36.391 --> 09:38.491
I don't exist unless you laugh at me!

09:40.529 --> 09:42.529
Look what you've done to me!

09:46.802 --> 09:48.668
He looks just like me!

09:48.704 --> 09:50.437
And Maggie looks just like Lisa.

09:50.472 --> 09:53.173
And Milhouse's mother looks
just like Milhouse's father.

09:53.208 --> 09:55.475
Why is this universe so lazy?

09:55.510 --> 09:56.876
Never mind that.

09:56.912 --> 09:58.778
Krusty, our son's prank caused this.

09:58.814 --> 09:59.913
We're gonna help you.

09:59.948 --> 10:01.614
Ah, forget it. I'm finished.

10:01.650 --> 10:03.183
Oh!

10:03.218 --> 10:05.051
- Wait, wait.
- What?

10:05.087 --> 10:06.219
You can still work.

10:06.254 --> 10:07.487
What if you gave up comedy,

10:07.522 --> 10:09.823
and transitioned to serious acting?

10:09.858 --> 10:11.358
Eh, impossible.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.560
I've never shown genuine
emotion in my life.

10:13.595 --> 10:15.729
I'm even reading this off a card.

10:16.097 --> 10:17.098
_

10:17.099 --> 10:19.833
Okay, next card.

10:19.868 --> 10:21.735
But seriously, I gotta speak from the...

10:21.770 --> 10:23.570
next card... heart.

10:23.605 --> 10:25.338
I can't be a dramatic actor.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.874
I have all the depth of a foot bath.

10:27.909 --> 10:30.477
Next card. Skip that one. Next card.

10:30.512 --> 10:33.079
A lot of funny actors have
transitioned to drama:

10:33.115 --> 10:35.048
Tom Hanks, Albert Brooks.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.516
I'm not convinced.

10:36.551 --> 10:38.084
- Michael Keaton.
- I'm in.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.886
- Zach Braff.
- Now I'm not so sure.

10:39.921 --> 10:42.889
- Bryan Cranston.
- I'm in. And hopeful.

10:43.444 --> 10:44.542
_

10:45.761 --> 10:50.230
Greetings! I am your director,
Llewellyn Sinclair,

10:50.265 --> 10:52.732
and you are the Barbies and Kens

10:52.768 --> 10:54.334
whom I shall pose

10:54.369 --> 10:57.270
in my Malibu beach house
of thespic triumph.

10:57.305 --> 10:59.572
My choice for our play
is Arthur Miller's

10:59.608 --> 11:01.441
Death of a Salesman.

11:02.744 --> 11:04.677
However, the rights cost too much,

11:04.713 --> 11:07.981
so we'll be doing this knockoff
version, The Salesman's Bad Day.

11:09.484 --> 11:11.584
Don't worry, the text is just Play-Doh

11:11.620 --> 11:13.520
to be extruded through the Fun Factory

11:13.555 --> 11:15.955
of my Tony Award-watching genius.

11:15.991 --> 11:19.259
To play Willie Salesman, please
welcome the man who's taking

11:19.294 --> 11:22.662
a bold leap into
intentional unfunniness,

11:22.697 --> 11:25.098
and giving me a ride home tonight,

11:25.133 --> 11:27.801
and maybe more, hmm?

11:27.836 --> 11:30.070
Mr. Herschel Krustofsky.

11:30.105 --> 11:32.705
Hey-hey. Let me see the script.

11:32.741 --> 11:34.941
My line. My line. Garbage.

11:34.976 --> 11:36.309
Garbage. My line.

11:36.344 --> 11:37.710
I don't know.

11:37.746 --> 11:39.312
Should I really be doing this?

11:39.347 --> 11:40.880
I'm an out-of-work has-been

11:40.916 --> 11:43.583
whose next logical step
is to take his own life.

11:43.618 --> 11:46.786
And that's exactly what
Death of a Salesman is about.

11:46.822 --> 11:49.155
I thought this was The
Salesman's Bad Day.

11:49.191 --> 11:50.657
And that's exactly what I said.

11:50.692 --> 11:52.625
Anyone hear different? I thought not!

11:52.661 --> 11:54.727
But Krusty, the part of Willie Loman,

11:54.763 --> 11:56.896
I mean "Salesman," is perfect for you.

11:56.932 --> 11:58.398
You'll just be playing yourself.

11:58.433 --> 12:00.834
- Can I play someone I like?
- No.

12:01.201 --> 12:03.661
_

12:04.973 --> 12:08.842
I know he can't see me, but
can he still feel my love?

12:08.877 --> 12:11.578
I'm afraid the glass blocks that, too.

12:11.613 --> 12:13.079
Oh.

12:13.115 --> 12:16.416
Marge, I promise I will
make your boy whole.

12:16.451 --> 12:19.152
I want to believe that so much.

12:19.187 --> 12:21.254
I'll never forget how peaceful he was

12:21.289 --> 12:24.824
in those moments before he
took his very first breath.

12:33.568 --> 12:36.469
Bart, you act like you
don't have a problem,

12:36.505 --> 12:38.838
but deep down, you know you need help.

12:38.874 --> 12:40.974
No way. I am awesome.

12:41.009 --> 12:44.611
Sit down and I'll elaborate.

12:44.646 --> 12:47.013
Um, I think I'll need some help.

12:47.048 --> 12:49.616
Uh, Marge, could you come in here?

12:49.651 --> 12:52.018
Please, take my seat.

13:04.232 --> 13:06.633
We need to get to the bottom of this.

13:06.668 --> 13:08.468
Right to the point.

13:08.503 --> 13:09.836
No, no, no!

13:09.871 --> 13:12.205
Oh, well, maybe I should
try a different tack.

13:16.578 --> 13:19.078
Mom, don't sit down!
I don't want to hurt you.

13:19.114 --> 13:22.849
Okay, you just completed
step one: learning empathy.

13:22.884 --> 13:25.885
Ow!

13:25.921 --> 13:27.053
Pop, look.

13:27.088 --> 13:29.222
I am losing the weight.

13:29.257 --> 13:31.324
Come on, Krusty!

13:31.359 --> 13:33.826
There's raw emotion just
beneath your surface.

13:33.862 --> 13:35.161
Frack it!

13:35.197 --> 13:36.829
Oh, I don't know, I'm scared.

13:36.865 --> 13:38.731
The theater is not for cowards.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.867
All I ask for is integrity and honesty

13:40.902 --> 13:42.402
in The Salesman's Bad Day.

13:42.437 --> 13:44.003
Title may change.

13:44.039 --> 13:46.673
Now, Herschel, summon
that talent you've hidden

13:46.708 --> 13:49.576
from the entire world for 60 years.

13:49.611 --> 13:52.278
I can't!

13:55.650 --> 13:58.551
Hershel, my son, listen
to me and listen good.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.287
You are a once-in-a-generation
performer.

14:01.323 --> 14:02.689
You think so?

14:02.724 --> 14:04.857
No! I was faking it.

14:04.893 --> 14:06.759
And if I can do it, so can you.

14:06.795 --> 14:09.028
And now, become a great actor.

14:09.064 --> 14:11.364
And now, sense memory.

14:11.399 --> 14:12.699
And now, be present.

14:12.734 --> 14:13.900
And articulate!

14:13.935 --> 14:15.435
- And we breathe.
- Oh, okay.

14:15.470 --> 14:17.870
And great actor.

14:17.906 --> 14:19.105
I'm sorry, my sons.

14:19.140 --> 14:20.406
Clench butt.

14:20.442 --> 14:21.908
I'm finished as a salesman.

14:21.943 --> 14:23.543
Clenchier.

14:23.578 --> 14:26.079
The only thing I have left
worth anything is...

14:26.114 --> 14:28.047
Transport me to another plane.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.782
my life insurance.

14:29.818 --> 14:32.452
But, Pop, that only
pays off if you're...

14:32.487 --> 14:33.820
Big pause.

14:35.824 --> 14:37.423
Dead.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.559
Your pop is gonna go out
on his route, boys.

14:39.594 --> 14:41.227
One last time.

14:41.263 --> 14:42.996
No, Pop. No.

14:43.031 --> 14:45.732
Tell your mother I'm sorry
about the woman in Boston!

14:45.767 --> 14:49.068
Also, my death is a metaphor
for American industry!

14:52.507 --> 14:54.240
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

14:54.276 --> 14:57.677
And I'll be fine, unless I get
those voices in my head.

14:57.712 --> 15:00.146
You can't act.

15:00.181 --> 15:01.914
Uh-oh.

15:01.950 --> 15:04.517
You're a clown, and that's
all you'll ever be.

15:04.552 --> 15:06.753
And when you die,
they'll be playing this:

15:06.788 --> 15:08.321
No.

15:08.356 --> 15:09.922
No. Stop it.

15:09.958 --> 15:12.025
No! No! No!

15:12.060 --> 15:13.626
Ugh. Ah!

15:13.662 --> 15:15.695
Anything wrong, Krusty?

15:15.730 --> 15:17.930
Only what's tormented me my entire life.

15:17.966 --> 15:19.999
Very good. See you tomorrow.

15:23.560 --> 15:27.227
_

15:27.732 --> 15:30.149
Reverend, I'm here for my last step:

15:30.149 --> 15:32.717
to make amends for the
rotten things I've done.

15:32.752 --> 15:33.851
Oh, fine.

15:33.886 --> 15:36.854
Let me get into uniform.

15:36.889 --> 15:39.056
I'm sorry I cut all the
Bible ribbons short

15:39.092 --> 15:40.591
so no one could mark their place.

15:40.626 --> 15:41.892
Why you son of a...

15:47.355 --> 15:49.822
Willie, I'm sorry I shaved your beard.

15:49.858 --> 15:52.225
I've had to wear a merkin on me face.

15:53.929 --> 15:56.162
I also had the blades removed
from your lawnmower.

15:56.197 --> 15:57.830
You've just been riding around.

15:57.866 --> 15:59.933
No one interferes with me mowing!

15:59.968 --> 16:02.235
And I'm sorry I used
your baseball chalker

16:02.270 --> 16:03.970
to write "Skinner Sucks."

16:04.005 --> 16:06.572
I'll show you who su...
Wait, you can do that?

16:06.608 --> 16:08.174
Please don't encourage me.

16:08.209 --> 16:10.143
_

16:10.178 --> 16:11.811
Thank you for encouraging me.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.680
Ugh, we're out of chalk.

16:13.715 --> 16:17.317
You know, I had just completed rehab.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.352
Well, me, too.

16:20.464 --> 16:22.409
_

16:22.691 --> 16:24.257
America loves a lot of things,

16:24.292 --> 16:26.526
but I never dreamed a
comeback was one of them.

16:26.561 --> 16:27.727
- Tell me, Krusty.
- No, no.

16:27.762 --> 16:28.995
No more of the "K" word.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.396
I'm a serious actor now.

16:30.432 --> 16:32.332
If only my father could see me.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.768
Oh, I see you. Son, you
used to be a putz.

16:35.804 --> 16:37.837
Now you're a putz trying
to be a schmendrick,

16:37.872 --> 16:39.539
which makes you a schmeckle.

16:39.574 --> 16:41.541
Get out of my head!

16:42.744 --> 16:45.745
Yet another puff piece
that ends in madness.

16:45.780 --> 16:48.681
I know you lost the love
of Linda Ellerbee

16:48.717 --> 16:50.583
while we were launching the luge

16:50.618 --> 16:52.085
at the Olympics in Lillehammer.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.786
B-B-B-Brokaw.

16:54.285 --> 16:57.158
_

16:57.158 --> 16:59.625
Bart Simpson cured of pranking?
_

16:59.661 --> 17:01.361
I never thought I'd see it.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.262
And you haven't. Look up there.

17:03.298 --> 17:04.964
Water balloons, ready to drop.

17:06.768 --> 17:10.069
It's times like this I'm
glad I have eyebrows.

17:13.842 --> 17:16.476
Sweetie, I've never been prouder of you.

17:16.511 --> 17:21.247
I knew my little bad seed
could bloom into a flower.

17:21.281 --> 17:23.583
You're proud of me?

17:28.256 --> 17:30.456
That's right. Now go give that speech

17:30.492 --> 17:33.593
and know that sitting in that
audience will be your mother,

17:33.628 --> 17:36.462
who's always believed in you.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.837
Nothing can rain on my parade today.

17:46.307 --> 17:49.642
I... I... I... Run!

17:55.183 --> 17:57.283
Simpson!

17:58.653 --> 18:00.653
Motherhood sucks.

18:04.492 --> 18:06.592
Boys will be boys.

18:08.329 --> 18:09.695
Ah!

18:09.731 --> 18:11.497
You can't come in here.

18:11.533 --> 18:13.599
This is the "boys will be boys" room.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.505
_

18:17.505 --> 18:20.840
Tonight, you will make
theatrical history.

18:20.875 --> 18:22.809
You'll take a play that has been seen

18:22.844 --> 18:26.612
all over the world more
times than man can count,

18:26.648 --> 18:28.848
and you will do the best version ever.

18:28.883 --> 18:31.851
How do I know? Because I
just took six Valiums.

18:31.886 --> 18:34.320
See you outside.

18:36.191 --> 18:38.524
You'll never get rid of me.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.194
You'll always be a self-hating clown.

18:45.233 --> 18:48.134
When I was 17, I walked into the Amazon.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.369
The company, not the river.

18:50.405 --> 18:53.139
And when I was 21, I walked out.

18:53.174 --> 18:57.076
And, man, was I loaded.

18:57.112 --> 18:59.679
Thank you, Jeff Bezos.

18:59.714 --> 19:01.214
Listen to your uncle, boys.

19:01.249 --> 19:02.915
He's a great man.

19:02.951 --> 19:04.984
The audience is quiet.
That means you're bombing.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.652
Quick, you got to get a laugh.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.221
Drop your pants, show your fanny.

19:08.256 --> 19:09.722
You know, your "A" material.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.390
Get out of my head.

19:11.426 --> 19:13.259
I... am...

19:13.294 --> 19:14.861
a serious actor!

19:17.432 --> 19:19.532
Laughs? I'm getting laughs.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.934

Okay, but now that I'm big again,

I can't work Tuesdays, Thursdays,

19:49.230 --> 19:51.931

Raptors' home games.

He's ruining my play.

20:13.704 --> 20:16.469
Well, don't worry. You've got
plenty of other good plays.

Oh, wait. You don't.
