[theme music playing]

00:23.490 --> 00:24.491
[gags]

00:36.736 --> 00:38.671
[upbeat music playing]

00:40.206 --> 00:42.275
Here's your birthday cake, Tweety.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.611
Double fudge chocolate seed cake.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.046
Your favorite!

00:46.112 --> 00:46.880
Mmm.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.681
Oh, boy, I can't wait!

00:48.748 --> 00:50.283
I just love birthdays.

00:50.383 --> 00:53.553
I'll be right back with some refreshments.

01:13.873 --> 01:15.275
[thuds]

01:33.426 --> 01:34.394
[exclaims]

01:34.461 --> 01:36.129
What do they put in this stuff?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.999
[doorbell ringing]

01:40.800 --> 01:42.735
Oh, look! A package.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.971
With no label or shipping address?

01:45.071 --> 01:48.608
The president always says, "If you see a suspicious package,

01:48.675 --> 01:50.410
call the bomb squad."

01:51.778 --> 01:54.981
Remember, if you see something, tell people.

01:55.081 --> 01:56.282
[sirens wailing]

01:58.251 --> 01:59.919
[motor whirring]

02:10.497 --> 02:12.165
[explosion]

02:14.200 --> 02:17.871
Wow. That idea really bombed.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.041
[thrashing]

02:26.679 --> 02:28.448
[dramatic music playing]

02:39.659 --> 02:41.861
Blow out the candles, Tweety.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.163
[inhales deeply]

02:44.831 --> 02:46.166
[gulps]

02:48.201 --> 02:49.802
[fire bell ringing]

02:55.041 --> 02:57.243

03:10.423 --> 03:12.892
[amusing music playing]

03:14.527 --> 03:16.196
[growling]

03:16.262 --> 03:17.330
Back, peasant.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.766
Birthday magician coming through.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.203
[doorbell ringing]

03:23.269 --> 03:25.605
Ooh. Granny got me a magician.

03:25.705 --> 03:26.940
Come in! Come in!

03:29.175 --> 03:31.010
Ladies and gentlemen.

03:31.077 --> 03:35.014
For my first illusion, the disappearing canary trick.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.617
[amusing music playing]

03:49.095 --> 03:51.731
Okay, that's the end of the performance. See you next time.

04:12.919 --> 04:13.753
[thuds]

04:19.492 --> 04:22.095
Now, this idea can't fail.

04:23.162 --> 04:24.964
[snoring]

04:27.934 --> 04:29.636
[creaking]

04:34.440 --> 04:37.677
[Granny] Okay, Tweety. Time to open your presents.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.114
Ooh. Birdseed! Thank you, Granny!

04:42.181 --> 04:43.483
[whirring]

04:45.251 --> 04:47.687
Look at that, a pinata.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.656
I just love pinata's.

04:49.756 --> 04:50.923
So, do I!

04:53.626 --> 04:55.595
[thrashing]

04:57.997 --> 04:59.932
No candy is coming out, Granny.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.769
Let me give it one last whack.

05:02.835 --> 05:03.703
[glass breaking]

05:08.007 --> 05:10.443
[thrashing]

05:12.712 --> 05:15.548
Now, that's what I call a house party.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.483
[both laughing]

05:25.325 --> 05:29.228
I am the mysterious, magnificent quack!

05:29.329 --> 05:32.231
I can see into your future!

05:32.332 --> 05:34.067
[thunder rumbling]

05:34.167 --> 05:36.469
What questions do you have for the cosmos?

05:36.536 --> 05:39.739
Oh, dear. I do have just one question.

05:39.839 --> 05:43.710
Uh, my life has been lonely lately.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.145
Is there anybody out there for me?

05:46.212 --> 05:47.647
I see...

05:47.714 --> 05:51.751
I see... A dark figure.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.487
It's not clear, but there's somebody.

05:54.554 --> 05:55.688
Really?

05:55.755 --> 05:56.756
[giggles]

05:56.856 --> 05:58.257
Can you tell me who it is?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.493
I need a stronger connection to get a read.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.996
Perhaps, you could hold your hands over the crystal ball.

06:04.063 --> 06:07.100
I'll do anything to know who it is.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.768
It's materializing!

06:08.868 --> 06:10.103
Close your eyes!

06:10.203 --> 06:12.605
Try to visualize your partner.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.207
I can't. Who is it?

06:14.273 --> 06:15.875
It's... It's...

06:16.442 --> 06:17.944
It's me.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.115
I do!

06:22.215 --> 06:24.217
Let's get married right away!

06:26.285 --> 06:29.889
Do you promise to cherish and hold, in sickness and health,

06:29.956 --> 06:32.058
-for richer and-- -We do!

06:35.762 --> 06:38.297
[exclaim excitedly]

06:40.366 --> 06:43.302
Well, this isn't what I was hoping for.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.873
But, I guess marriage is all about compromise.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.817
[dramatic music playing]

07:13.833 --> 07:15.835

Whew.
