00:55.889 --> 00:59.684
1879 (12TH YEAR OF THE NEW AGE)

00:59.768 --> 01:04.105
YOKOHAMA STATION

01:43.436 --> 01:44.979
You'll hurt yourselves!

01:46.231 --> 01:47.440
Rintaro!

02:15.510 --> 02:18.972
Was it you who sold a warship

02:19.055 --> 02:21.724
to Makoto Shishio?

02:22.308 --> 02:24.227
What might this be about?

02:25.436 --> 02:26.604
We are told

02:26.688 --> 02:31.109
a Shanghai arms dealer is on the train.

02:31.192 --> 02:33.069
How rude!

02:33.153 --> 02:35.280
This gentleman represents--

02:35.363 --> 02:38.783
Shouldn't you start
by introducing yourself?

02:43.538 --> 02:45.081
You're Japanese?

02:49.002 --> 02:52.213
You are Goro Fujita, Bureau of Police?

02:53.214 --> 02:54.048
Or

02:55.091 --> 02:59.137
is it Hajime Saito,
formerly of the Shogun police?

03:02.015 --> 03:05.768
You want weapons too?
I'll sell you all you want.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.689
Ironclads, Gatling guns, Snider rifles…

03:11.191 --> 03:14.110
Now that the Satsuma Rebellion's over,
I've got lots.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.447
Bring him.

03:18.865 --> 03:19.866
On your feet.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.580
I wouldn't.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.961
Where's Battôsai the Killer?

03:33.838 --> 03:35.757
Why is the Shanghai mafia asking?

03:35.840 --> 03:36.966
Does he still have

03:38.384 --> 03:40.303
the scars on his cheek?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.347
What?

03:47.977 --> 03:48.853
Well?

03:50.230 --> 03:54.442
Does he still have
the cross of scars on his cheek?

03:58.696 --> 04:00.073
He does, huh?

04:01.699 --> 04:03.159
They're still there?

04:05.662 --> 04:08.873
I guess my sister still hates him.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.675
You want a fight, Shinsengumi?

04:20.593 --> 04:21.719
Halt!

04:38.528 --> 04:39.654
Hold it!

05:50.683 --> 05:52.143
You want me?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.275
I'm all yours.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.286
Take him!

06:41.692 --> 06:48.658
ASAKUSA, TOKYO

06:57.125 --> 06:57.959
Sorry.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.003
That bride looks fine!

07:01.087 --> 07:02.130
Good for you!

07:02.839 --> 07:04.424
Will you look at that!

07:05.842 --> 07:07.009
Well!

07:11.055 --> 07:13.766
All these new Western ways.

07:15.685 --> 07:20.398
A white kimono would be nice,
but I'd like that dress too.

07:20.481 --> 07:24.110
How many weddings
are you planning to have?

07:24.193 --> 07:26.696
I prefer the old hairstyles.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.947
-Why?
-What?

07:28.030 --> 07:29.657
They suit an old head?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.499
Kaoru?

07:38.583 --> 07:41.794
Kaoru! You're staring into space.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.297
She's imagining she's marrying Kenshin.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.091
You're a kid with a big mouth!

07:47.175 --> 07:48.593
Cut it out!

07:49.802 --> 07:51.345
Oh, Kenshin.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.389
It is certainly very beautiful.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.687
Ms. Kaoru?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.232
What's wrong?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.859
Figure it out.

08:06.777 --> 08:07.653
Huh?

08:08.779 --> 08:11.365
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS MINISTRY
BUREAU OF POLICE TRAINING GROUND

08:11.449 --> 08:12.658
Begin!

08:22.251 --> 08:23.920
We've finally started.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.505
Very good.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.281
Mr. Maekawa.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.076
Chief Uramura.

08:57.119 --> 09:01.541
Several men from my dojo
are serving as instructors here.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.167
They are?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.963
It's been 12 years since the Restoration.

09:08.130 --> 09:11.092
These young men have never seen war.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.681
Japan has sent troops to Taiwan
and now to Korea.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.519
We're still arguing with China

09:22.019 --> 09:25.481
over our claim that Okinawa is ours.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.902
There could be war with China at any time.

09:38.119 --> 09:45.042
TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS

09:52.008 --> 09:53.301
Thanks for coming out.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.386
You're nothing but trouble.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.347
If you would confirm transfer…

09:59.932 --> 10:02.977
He wants you to confirm the transfer.

10:13.529 --> 10:14.697
Thank you.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.241
Come on.

10:43.893 --> 10:47.605
Why the hell did we free
a Shanghai mafia boss?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.649
We didn't free him.

10:51.400 --> 10:56.072
He was released into custody of the consul
under the terms of our treaty.

10:56.572 --> 11:00.242
Why should China judge
a violation of our law?

11:00.326 --> 11:02.495
They have jurisdiction.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.916
It's the same with a Japanese in China.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.294
Enter.

11:15.966 --> 11:16.967
Remember Cho?

11:17.677 --> 11:21.222
One of Shishio's Ten Swords.

11:21.889 --> 11:25.142
He's been working undercover for us.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.021
Thanks for your help back then.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.737
I don't trust turncoats.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.740
Oh, dear!

11:40.241 --> 11:41.450
Don't be like that.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.414
He'll keep an eye on
what Shanghai's doing.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.250
You know the drill.

12:01.929 --> 12:05.099
BEEF HOT POT
AKABEKO

12:06.892 --> 12:09.937
Bring more! This isn't enough.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.148
I'm starving!

12:12.231 --> 12:14.108
Beef! It's been a while.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.151
Right?

12:16.485 --> 12:17.737
Here you are.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.740
Great!

12:22.074 --> 12:23.576
Where were you?

12:23.659 --> 12:27.580
Fencing with the constables
at the Police Dojo.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.373
It's busy here.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.125
Tae works us hard.

12:31.959 --> 12:35.504
Find a boyfriend like Kaoru too,
and I'll give you time off.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.339
Tae, stop it!

12:37.423 --> 12:38.382
Oh?

12:38.466 --> 12:40.468
You stop it too!

12:41.302 --> 12:43.721
Anyway, let's eat.

12:48.809 --> 12:49.727
That's hot!

12:49.810 --> 12:51.061
Why are you shoving it in?

12:51.145 --> 12:52.438
You shut up.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.773
Calm down, Kaoru!

12:53.856 --> 12:55.191
I am calm.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.489
I'm stuffed!

13:48.244 --> 13:49.620
Pig!

13:49.703 --> 13:52.122
And you eat too much meat.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.875
Your face is still red.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.962
You shut up. I'm not blushing.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.297
What's wrong?

14:01.006 --> 14:04.134
Nothing. I'm fine.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.182
It's time you got used to peace.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.524
If you would, Kujiranami.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.195
The opening shot of vengeance.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.592
What was that noise?

14:59.648 --> 15:00.816
Move!

15:01.650 --> 15:03.736
Stand aside!

15:03.819 --> 15:06.238
Out of the way!

15:09.658 --> 15:10.701
Move!

15:15.664 --> 15:17.708
Mr. Himura!

15:17.791 --> 15:19.501
What's going on, Chief?

15:19.585 --> 15:20.836
What's up?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.881
Someone fired a cannon into the city!

15:23.964 --> 15:26.759
They hit a beef place called Akabeko.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.385
Akabeko?

15:28.469 --> 15:32.056
It came from Ueno Hill.
We'll surround the area.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.475
They might shoot again.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.101
Be careful.

15:38.896 --> 15:42.149
I'll go with the Chief.
Go check on Akabeko.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.692
-Okay.
-I'll come too!

15:43.776 --> 15:44.693
Come on!

16:11.261 --> 16:12.429
What's going on?

16:16.016 --> 16:18.644
Tae! Tsubame!

16:25.234 --> 16:26.151
Search the area!

16:31.281 --> 16:33.367
Only a shrine tree snapped off.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.286
Not even a trace of a gun mount.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.958
They probably used the tree
to stop the recoil.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.503
Even if they did aim and fire from here,

16:44.586 --> 16:48.090
surely, they couldn't hit Akabeko!

16:49.758 --> 16:50.676
Chief!

16:51.969 --> 16:53.303
-Chief!
-Yes?

16:54.805 --> 16:55.806
We found this.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.477
"Man judges"?

17:01.645 --> 17:05.691
It's usually, "Heaven judges."
Don't they even know that?

17:06.316 --> 17:07.234
No.

17:11.572 --> 17:15.117
Someone will pass judgment
in Heaven's place.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.331
JUSTIFICATION FOR EXECUTION

17:21.415 --> 17:24.501
The shogunate and the Shinsengumi…

17:24.585 --> 17:27.087
They both justified their killings
that way.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.631
So this means…

17:31.133 --> 17:33.260
I think someone's saying

17:34.470 --> 17:36.972
if Heaven will not judge,

17:37.056 --> 17:38.682
then they will.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.392
I see.

17:40.893 --> 17:46.065
So some malcontents are still unhappy
with the new government.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.900
We can't have that.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.986
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir!

17:52.029 --> 17:54.740
-Search every corner of this area!
-Yes, sir!

17:59.078 --> 18:00.746
Anyone in mind?

18:01.830 --> 18:02.748
No.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.836
The man from Shanghai?

18:10.881 --> 18:13.050
He sold Shishio that ship.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.139
He said something.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.392
"Does Battôsai still have his scars?"

18:42.162 --> 18:48.460
MAN JUDGES

18:48.544 --> 18:50.921
OGUNI CLINIC

18:51.004 --> 18:52.005
Hey!

18:52.089 --> 18:54.550
More bandages!

18:54.633 --> 18:57.594
We've used everything we had.
I'll get more.

18:57.678 --> 18:58.887
Thanks.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.097
I'm finished here.

19:00.889 --> 19:02.766
-Press down on that wound.
-Yes.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.479
Megumi!

19:07.980 --> 19:10.566
How are you doing?

19:10.649 --> 19:12.109
As best I can.

19:13.026 --> 19:13.861
Tae!

19:15.237 --> 19:17.322
Tsubame!

19:18.073 --> 19:21.451
She got burned trying to get people out.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.706
Kaoru and Yahiko just left.

19:25.789 --> 19:26.957
Oh, I see.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.252
What a thing to do!

20:09.499 --> 20:10.751
Ms. Kaoru? Yahiko?

20:11.585 --> 20:12.753
Are you all right?

20:12.836 --> 20:17.299
Yes. We were checking on the injured
at Megumi's clinic.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.843
Tsubame and Tae?

20:37.611 --> 20:42.074
Anyway, who could have done
something this horrible?

20:49.790 --> 20:50.832
Megumi,

20:52.209 --> 20:53.377
can I ask you something?

20:55.796 --> 20:56.922
What?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.217
Kenshin's scars…

21:01.718 --> 21:04.721
They're pretty old. Why don't they fade?

21:06.431 --> 21:07.391
I don't know.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.945
I asked Dr. Oguni about that once.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.322
And?

21:24.908 --> 21:27.077
It was half superstition.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.167
He said a scar
inflicted in righteous anger

21:34.751 --> 21:38.714
won't disappear until
that anger is appeased.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.625
You're still up?

22:19.588 --> 22:20.464
Sano…

22:22.716 --> 22:27.095
So what's going on
that we don't know about?

22:37.064 --> 22:38.023
Kenshin…

22:41.193 --> 22:43.904
I understand very well

22:45.280 --> 22:49.576
that you don't want to worry
Kaoru, Yahiko, and Megumi.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.287
But…

22:55.832 --> 22:58.210
surely you can tell me.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.767
What's that noise?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.858
Mr. Himura! Open up!

23:23.360 --> 23:24.569
Mr. Himura!

23:30.325 --> 23:32.077
Come quick! The Maekawa Dojo!

23:32.160 --> 23:33.537
What?

23:34.121 --> 23:34.955
An attack.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.334
It's a slaughter. The police came,

23:40.293 --> 23:41.795
but they're no match!

23:42.379 --> 23:43.839
-I'll come!
-No.

23:45.090 --> 23:49.970
I'll be back by morning.
Keep the gate shut tight.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.431
You're in charge.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.151
Mr. Himura!

24:05.402 --> 24:06.862
-Mr. Himura!
-What now?

24:06.945 --> 24:12.409
Have Chief Uramura put guards at
the Kamiya Dojo and Oguni Clinic.

24:12.492 --> 24:15.454
There's no word from the Chief.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.081
We're going there now.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.417
Kenshin.

24:20.500 --> 24:24.588
Leave the Maekawa Dojo to me.
You go to the Chief's.

24:24.671 --> 24:25.881
I thank you.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.427
URAMURA

24:38.852 --> 24:42.481
Put that down, or I'll shoot!

24:42.564 --> 24:44.399
Fool!

24:44.483 --> 24:47.486
You think that thing will stop me?

24:56.411 --> 24:57.579
Husband!

24:57.662 --> 25:01.833
Who are you? What do you want?

25:08.089 --> 25:11.051
What the hell's going on?

25:18.975 --> 25:21.186
Okay, who's next?

25:32.948 --> 25:34.783
Damn you!

25:36.910 --> 25:38.578
What do you want?

25:50.882 --> 25:53.093
Oh, relax!

25:53.927 --> 25:55.887
You won't be lonely.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.015
You can all die together.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.684
No! Kill me instead!

26:07.148 --> 26:08.858
Don't hate me for this.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.528
Instead…

26:18.410 --> 26:20.370
Hate me?

26:22.080 --> 26:25.458
Quite enough people hate me already.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.463
Left cheek, crossed scars…

26:30.547 --> 26:32.757
Mr. Himura! Be careful!

26:32.841 --> 26:34.551
So it's you?

26:36.136 --> 26:37.262
Battôsai the Killer?

26:38.847 --> 26:39.681
Perfect.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.235
Tell me…

27:36.363 --> 27:38.615
who's using you for revenge?

27:41.951 --> 27:44.287
A good guy.

27:44.371 --> 27:48.541
We used to see
who could kill the most in a night.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.214
It was fun.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.385
So you've led a life of shame too.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.015
We're two of a kind.

28:04.099 --> 28:07.727
If you're after revenge,
I'll fight all you want.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.940
But don't drag others into this.

28:54.941 --> 28:58.319
Mementos of my god-given gift!

29:16.087 --> 29:17.172
Get out!

29:35.940 --> 29:36.858
Hey!

29:39.652 --> 29:40.570
Are you alive?

29:43.990 --> 29:46.409
I'm too late!

29:50.288 --> 29:51.790
What happened?

30:04.594 --> 30:07.055
I know what you're thinking.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.645
"Who are these guys?"

30:14.938 --> 30:16.481
"How many of them are there?"

30:18.107 --> 30:23.446
"Who's the leader?"
"Where will they attack next?"

30:31.788 --> 30:34.290
Suffer, then.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.503
Now

30:39.462 --> 30:41.381
man judges.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.070
Mr. Himura!

31:07.740 --> 31:08.658
Why?

31:09.617 --> 31:11.536
Why us?

31:15.498 --> 31:16.749
Why?

32:08.468 --> 32:09.761
What's the matter,

32:11.930 --> 32:13.056
Battôsai?

32:25.234 --> 32:27.737
You look as if
you've seen my sister's ghost?

32:44.671 --> 32:45.880
You…

32:48.675 --> 32:49.676
It can't be…

32:56.849 --> 32:58.226
What if it is?

33:08.611 --> 33:10.154
Will you kill me?

33:13.074 --> 33:15.159
Like you did her?

33:17.704 --> 33:20.415
With that filthy sword?

33:23.501 --> 33:24.961
It's been 14 years.

33:26.212 --> 33:31.467
I went to Shanghai, nearly died there,
and worked my way up

33:32.135 --> 33:35.722
to the top of the Shanghai mafia.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.808
All the while

33:39.684 --> 33:42.645
planning to come back
and avenge my sister.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.861
Just wait.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.948
Man's judgment is at hand.

33:56.784 --> 33:59.328
The men with me hate you too.

33:59.912 --> 34:04.167
And we are capable of anything.

34:07.628 --> 34:08.713
Battôsai…

34:10.715 --> 34:13.718
I don't want to simply cause you pain.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.140
I want you to suffer.

34:58.346 --> 34:59.305
Kenshin's here.

35:00.723 --> 35:04.060
What's all this trouble about?

35:06.771 --> 35:07.730
Hey,

35:08.773 --> 35:09.649
Kenshin.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.193
Kenshin!

35:17.198 --> 35:19.158
Welcome back, Kenshin.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.666
I'll get some rest.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.181
Something's not right.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.562
I've never seen him look

35:48.729 --> 35:50.148
so tormented before.

36:19.719 --> 36:23.681
<i>Tokyo is now on high alert.</i>

36:24.807 --> 36:30.438
The dojo of fencing instructor Maekawa
was attacked last night.

36:31.522 --> 36:35.276
As was the home of Chief Uramura.

36:35.943 --> 36:39.405
Most of the officers
who responded were injured.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.784
We don't know who the attackers were.

36:43.868 --> 36:44.994
However,

36:45.578 --> 36:48.664
this is clearly a challenge
to police authorities.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.459
Our dignity is at stake.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.963
We must preserve public order in Tokyo!

37:08.684 --> 37:11.020
It wasn't easy, but I found them.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.773
Their armory.

37:14.982 --> 37:17.735
They've taken a place in Yokohama.

37:20.613 --> 37:24.575
A man named Wu Heixing.
A Shanghai millionaire.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.459
Lack of scruples makes good spies.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.880
Thanks a lot!

37:40.299 --> 37:42.385
I was one of the Ten Swords.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.347
Like I'd really work for the new regime!

37:55.690 --> 37:59.860
After yesterday's events,

38:00.569 --> 38:06.993
we have 30 comrades
stationed in the compound.

38:11.747 --> 38:12.832
Come in.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.256
It's been a while, boss.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.216
Heixing?

38:23.384 --> 38:25.594
When did you come back from Shanghai?

38:26.637 --> 38:30.725
I was told you're finishing up
what you came to do.

38:30.808 --> 38:36.397
I just wanted to make sure
you remembered our deal.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.401
I remember.

38:41.777 --> 38:44.780
Once I'm done, the organization is yours.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.867
Arms, opium… Do what you like.

38:48.659 --> 38:51.120
Japan will be yours.

39:20.399 --> 39:21.609
<i>Good news, Tomoe.</i>

39:23.402 --> 39:28.491
It's finally time for heaven
to levy judgment on Battôsai.

39:32.286 --> 39:35.122
Enishi… Not you!

39:36.040 --> 39:37.291
You didn't know?

39:38.250 --> 39:40.961
They said they had told you.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.385
Go home, Enishi.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.805
You're our family's son.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.849
-Don't get mixed up in this.
-To hell with the family!

39:54.558 --> 39:56.519
It's you I want to--

39:56.602 --> 39:58.562
Go home, Enishi.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.400
Why?

40:08.447 --> 40:09.615
What happened?

40:15.704 --> 40:17.456
Why protect him?

40:18.124 --> 40:19.917
He's your enemy!

40:20.000 --> 40:22.920
He stole your happiness.
You should want revenge!

40:55.661 --> 40:59.081
KAMIYA DOJO

42:15.908 --> 42:20.120
Last night after you two went out,

42:21.830 --> 42:23.290
Yahiko said…

42:25.292 --> 42:27.836
he was sick of being weak.

42:33.300 --> 42:38.097
In his own way,
he senses that trouble's coming.

42:40.307 --> 42:42.935
He's trying to strengthen himself.

42:56.031 --> 42:58.075
Then I should talk to you all.

43:02.121 --> 43:06.333
Ms. Kaoru, get everyone together.

43:17.094 --> 43:22.474
Last night, the Maekawa Dojo
and Chief Uramura's home were attacked.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.981
All to take vengeance on me.

43:32.234 --> 43:34.278
Vengeance on you?

43:37.114 --> 43:39.783
The Akabeko attack too.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.708
They were planned by
a man named Enishi Yukishiro.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.880
Brother to Tomoe Himura…

43:54.798 --> 43:57.217
my wife, who I stabbed to death.

44:10.397 --> 44:11.982
As the shogunate fell…

44:15.694 --> 44:16.695
when…

44:19.406 --> 44:21.992
I got these scars.

44:27.665 --> 44:31.210
Woman, pour us a drink.

44:31.835 --> 44:36.674
We're out day and night
risking our lives for the likes of you.

44:38.926 --> 44:41.929
Kyoto's no place for fake patriots.

44:44.515 --> 44:45.891
You're mine!

44:56.276 --> 44:59.238
I thought I'd come out and say thank you.

45:02.449 --> 45:04.201
You really…

45:06.453 --> 45:08.497
make it rain blood.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.214
<i>I'll stay with you…</i>

45:19.508 --> 45:21.593
<i>a while longer.</i>

45:45.284 --> 45:48.328
<i>What is happiness?</i>

45:50.164 --> 45:52.499
I feel like living here with you

45:53.834 --> 45:55.711
has answered that question for me.

46:00.048 --> 46:01.133
<i>I was</i>

46:02.050 --> 46:06.138
<i>engaged to be married.</i>

46:09.558 --> 46:10.976
Before the wedding

46:12.603 --> 46:14.396
in the unrest in Kyoto,

46:16.356 --> 46:17.941
he made the ultimate sacrifice.

46:24.990 --> 46:27.367
<i>If you want revenge,</i>

46:28.243 --> 46:33.123
get close to Battôsai and find out
all you can about him.

46:36.043 --> 46:40.088
Find his weak points.

46:43.050 --> 46:44.009
Tomoe…

46:46.178 --> 46:48.847
the happiness you've lost once…

46:51.558 --> 46:53.894
<i>you will never lose again.</i>

47:18.377 --> 47:19.753
<i>April 5th.</i>

47:20.921 --> 47:25.968
<i>Before our wedding,</i>
<i>Kiyosato made the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

47:38.480 --> 47:39.815
I can't die!

47:42.109 --> 47:44.152
There's someone I love.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.836
<i>I want to avenge Kiyosato.</i>

51:38.804 --> 51:40.097
Tomoe…

52:27.227 --> 52:28.395
Tomoe…

52:39.739 --> 52:41.074
Tomoe…

52:46.163 --> 52:47.789
You're angry too.

53:33.001 --> 53:34.169
Are you all right?

53:37.839 --> 53:42.010
This is the first you've heard
about this Tomoe person.

53:47.182 --> 53:48.141
Yes.

53:49.392 --> 53:50.477
It's a surprise.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.233
But…

53:58.443 --> 54:00.570
I feel sorry for her somehow.

54:05.033 --> 54:10.121
Perhaps she was very pure of heart.

54:13.792 --> 54:16.628
She hated herself for falling for

54:17.629 --> 54:20.131
the man who'd killed her first love.

54:24.427 --> 54:25.595
And so…

54:28.473 --> 54:31.351
maybe she meant for him to stab her.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.113
I'm sure…

54:45.073 --> 54:47.701
Kenshin will never forget Tomoe.

54:50.870 --> 54:52.497
To love someone like that…

54:55.375 --> 54:57.377
so deeply…

55:02.841 --> 55:04.092
and…

55:08.263 --> 55:10.098
have her die by your hand.

55:17.564 --> 55:19.107
You'd never forget that.

55:32.495 --> 55:33.455
But

55:35.123 --> 55:37.167
you and Kenshin are alive.

55:43.590 --> 55:48.178
If you're alive, you can move on together.

55:49.596 --> 55:54.768
Now that Tomoe's dead,
that's one thing she can't do.

56:04.277 --> 56:07.113
Go on. Go to him.

56:54.369 --> 56:55.370
Kenshin.

56:59.707 --> 57:00.917
Ms. Kaoru…

57:06.423 --> 57:08.091
I know you hate troubling people.

57:09.426 --> 57:12.595
I thought you might vanish again.

57:32.824 --> 57:33.950
Thank you.

57:59.184 --> 58:01.811
One gem after another!

58:05.607 --> 58:06.691
Well!

58:07.859 --> 58:11.946
A <i>wo-dao </i>Chinese sword!
I've never seen one before.

58:21.372 --> 58:24.375
What? I'm busy here.

58:27.879 --> 58:28.880
You, huh?

58:30.340 --> 58:34.135
The sword thief who lost to Battôsai
and switched sides?

58:34.761 --> 58:36.179
Sword hunter!

58:42.268 --> 58:43.478
Whatever.

58:44.604 --> 58:50.527
I sent the police to the wrong place,
just like that Chinese guy Wu said to.

58:51.486 --> 58:53.821
That deserves some reward.

58:54.447 --> 58:57.492
This is a great sword.

58:57.575 --> 58:59.285
It could hurt you.

59:00.578 --> 59:02.997
The balance is different
than Japanese swords.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.595
You seem sure of yourself.

59:20.056 --> 59:22.642
Do you hate Battôsai too?

59:31.568 --> 59:33.945
All of a sudden,

59:35.029 --> 59:36.864
I want to test this blade.

59:47.250 --> 59:48.835
KAMIYA DOJO

59:48.918 --> 59:52.463
Thank you for your efforts this past year.

59:53.381 --> 59:54.966
-Thank you, master.
-Thank you, master.

1:00:01.055 --> 1:00:02.390
Dismissed!

1:00:02.473 --> 1:00:03.391
<i>-Yes!</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:10.273
Take a break, and then we clean!

1:00:10.356 --> 1:00:11.482
-Yes!
-Yes!

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:53.941
<i>Now,</i>

1:00:54.025 --> 1:00:56.569
man judges.

1:00:56.653 --> 1:00:58.029
Why?

1:00:58.655 --> 1:01:00.657
<i>Why us?</i>

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:03.618
MAN JUDGES

1:01:22.303 --> 1:01:23.846
Hello!

1:01:28.893 --> 1:01:30.061
Howdy!

1:01:30.144 --> 1:01:31.688
Misao!

1:01:31.771 --> 1:01:32.647
How are you?

1:01:32.730 --> 1:01:36.109
What are you doing here?
Did you come from Kyoto?

1:01:36.192 --> 1:01:38.736
It took so long!

1:01:39.237 --> 1:01:40.947
Tokyo's so far away!

1:01:41.030 --> 1:01:43.574
Of course it is. Did you come alone?

1:01:46.619 --> 1:01:47.912
Aoshi too?

1:01:49.872 --> 1:01:51.457
Is Himura here?

1:02:04.387 --> 1:02:07.056
So what brings you here anyway?

1:02:09.475 --> 1:02:11.769
The Suikoji Temple priest

1:02:11.853 --> 1:02:16.357
heard from his late father that Himura
had something to do with Elder's death.

1:02:18.359 --> 1:02:22.280
The father apparently knew Himura.

1:02:24.782 --> 1:02:26.784
Imagine that.

1:02:28.035 --> 1:02:32.123
Battôsai fighting alongside
the Shogun's Hidden Watchers!

1:02:33.082 --> 1:02:35.209
Fate works in strange ways.

1:02:36.127 --> 1:02:40.173
Himura is living quietly in Tokyo now.

1:02:41.257 --> 1:02:42.467
I see.

1:02:44.051 --> 1:02:48.639
If you have the chance,
could you take him a message?

1:02:50.141 --> 1:02:57.064
My father had his late wife's diary,
and I'd like to return it.

1:03:00.735 --> 1:03:03.571
He often spoke with my father

1:03:05.156 --> 1:03:07.700
about how one who had killed so many

1:03:08.659 --> 1:03:11.412
should then lead his life.

1:03:12.288 --> 1:03:15.666
Or even if he still should live.

1:03:30.097 --> 1:03:31.015
Here.

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:41.526
This is Tomoe's diary?

1:03:44.779 --> 1:03:46.239
You knew about her?

1:03:48.950 --> 1:03:50.284
Did you read it?

1:03:50.868 --> 1:03:53.037
I couldn't do that!

1:03:53.788 --> 1:03:57.792
I'm sure it's important to Himura,
so I brought it.

1:04:37.123 --> 1:04:43.504
THE HEART TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH

1:04:46.299 --> 1:04:48.134
<i>The Watchers told me</i>

1:04:48.217 --> 1:04:50.303
something interesting.

1:04:51.137 --> 1:04:54.682
They said in December,
Tokyo will rain blood.

1:04:55.433 --> 1:04:59.395
And Battôsai will be the cause.

1:05:54.784 --> 1:06:01.499
YOKOHAMA WAREHOUSE DISTRICT

1:06:10.883 --> 1:06:13.010
Squad 2, around to the left.

1:06:13.594 --> 1:06:15.680
Squad 3, secure the back door.

1:06:16.347 --> 1:06:17.473
We charge in.

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:19.183
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1:07:20.870 --> 1:07:23.456
It's a damn trap!

1:08:01.452 --> 1:08:03.996
This should buy us some time.

1:08:34.151 --> 1:08:36.362
What's this? A newspaper extra?

1:08:38.531 --> 1:08:39.740
What is it?

1:08:42.993 --> 1:08:45.246
MAN JUDGES

1:08:51.794 --> 1:08:53.671
What's that?

1:08:54.421 --> 1:08:55.589
Look!

1:09:36.088 --> 1:09:37.673
What's that noise?

1:09:38.215 --> 1:09:40.092
The same as before.

1:09:48.767 --> 1:09:49.935
Captain Aoshi!

1:09:50.936 --> 1:09:52.104
I have to go!

1:10:25.429 --> 1:10:27.765
Let the festival begin!

1:11:08.472 --> 1:11:09.556
Take us down.

1:11:30.077 --> 1:11:31.537
Follow that.

1:11:31.620 --> 1:11:33.205
Do whatever you have to.

1:11:34.039 --> 1:11:34.999
Understood.

1:11:46.802 --> 1:11:48.887
Man's judgment is at hand.

1:11:50.097 --> 1:11:52.474
The men with me hate you too.

1:11:53.309 --> 1:11:57.271
And we are capable of anything.

1:12:00.274 --> 1:12:01.400
Battôsai…

1:12:03.444 --> 1:12:05.988
I don't want to simply cause you pain.

1:12:06.739 --> 1:12:07.823
<i>I want you to suffer.</i>

1:12:14.747 --> 1:12:16.248
Are you all right?

1:12:16.957 --> 1:12:18.459
Thank you!

1:12:59.208 --> 1:13:01.168
Hurry!

1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:07.299
Is Battôsai here?

1:13:10.010 --> 1:13:11.261
This is for him!

1:13:26.402 --> 1:13:27.361
Go.

1:13:27.444 --> 1:13:29.655
Upstairs! Hurry!

1:13:29.738 --> 1:13:30.989
Thank you!

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:33.992
Who are you?

1:13:35.244 --> 1:13:37.162
Evil powers

1:13:38.122 --> 1:13:41.208
will bury evil-doers in darkness.

1:13:43.836 --> 1:13:47.131
As the last captain
of the Hidden Watchers,

1:13:48.006 --> 1:13:49.967
that is my task.

1:14:14.908 --> 1:14:16.577
Whoever you are,

1:14:17.828 --> 1:14:20.914
you don't get in the way of Mumyoi!

1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.585
Don't just stand there!

1:14:25.377 --> 1:14:26.420
You too!

1:14:37.848 --> 1:14:38.932
Who are you?

1:14:46.273 --> 1:14:47.524
Is it you?

1:14:49.610 --> 1:14:52.237
Kenshin's brother-in-law?

1:14:58.035 --> 1:15:00.162
Well, he's not here.

1:15:00.245 --> 1:15:01.288
But

1:15:02.581 --> 1:15:06.835
if you've come looking for a fight,
I'll give you one.

1:15:10.255 --> 1:15:11.131
You will, huh?

1:15:13.425 --> 1:15:16.762
Big talk from tiny glasses!

1:15:39.618 --> 1:15:40.661
Captain Aoshi!

1:15:49.795 --> 1:15:50.754
Captain Aoshi!

1:15:51.463 --> 1:15:53.632
It's Battôsai we want!

1:15:56.552 --> 1:15:58.887
Not you!

1:16:19.074 --> 1:16:20.200
Sanosuke!

1:16:24.329 --> 1:16:27.916
Guys, when you're in a fight,

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:29.501
you use your head!

1:17:20.761 --> 1:17:21.887
Captain Aoshi!

1:17:31.605 --> 1:17:32.898
Captain Aoshi…

1:17:38.236 --> 1:17:39.488
Captain Aoshi!

1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:41.198
Captain Aoshi!

1:17:43.950 --> 1:17:45.160
Captain Aoshi!

1:17:46.244 --> 1:17:49.623
He shielded me.

1:17:50.499 --> 1:17:51.541
Are you all right?

1:17:52.584 --> 1:17:55.379
Thank you!

1:17:55.462 --> 1:17:57.881
Captain Aoshi!

1:18:01.218 --> 1:18:02.177
Captain Aoshi!

1:18:04.346 --> 1:18:05.514
Damn it!

1:18:40.006 --> 1:18:42.426
Wait, Battôsai!

1:18:46.555 --> 1:18:48.557
Finish me off.

1:18:56.148 --> 1:19:00.527
To restore the Emperor,

1:19:01.528 --> 1:19:04.197
you stole our samurai pride.

1:19:05.407 --> 1:19:06.825
You denied us…

1:19:09.369 --> 1:19:11.496
an honorable death.

1:19:16.084 --> 1:19:17.878
So now…

1:19:20.797 --> 1:19:22.382
with those hands…

1:19:25.469 --> 1:19:28.138
give me that now!

1:19:36.438 --> 1:19:37.856
That much

1:19:39.441 --> 1:19:42.152
you owe me!

1:19:52.037 --> 1:19:54.039
Run me through!

1:20:12.098 --> 1:20:13.266
I'm sorry.

1:20:17.354 --> 1:20:19.439
I have sworn that with this blade,

1:20:20.440 --> 1:20:22.526
I will never kill again.

1:20:25.529 --> 1:20:27.322
Live in the new age.

1:20:31.117 --> 1:20:32.077
Freeze!

1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:35.163
Then at least cut off this arm!

1:20:36.164 --> 1:20:37.791
Come quietly!

1:20:37.874 --> 1:20:40.710
Because if I still have it…

1:20:42.087 --> 1:20:43.880
Battôsai!

1:20:47.884 --> 1:20:49.427
Battôsai!

1:20:49.511 --> 1:20:52.472
Kill me! Please!

1:21:26.423 --> 1:21:27.382
Sano!

1:21:35.056 --> 1:21:36.099
Ken…

1:21:40.145 --> 1:21:41.271
Kaoru…

1:21:44.941 --> 1:21:46.109
Sorry.

1:21:48.403 --> 1:21:49.738
I'm sorry!

1:21:50.572 --> 1:21:52.073
He took Kaoru.

1:21:55.368 --> 1:21:56.828
I couldn't stop him.

1:21:58.788 --> 1:22:00.373
I couldn't do anything…

1:22:03.126 --> 1:22:04.377
but watch.

1:22:34.449 --> 1:22:35.909
Now you look good.

1:22:44.125 --> 1:22:45.418
Hold it!

1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:49.673
Keep your hands off her!

1:22:55.512 --> 1:22:56.972
Don't worry.

1:23:15.699 --> 1:23:16.950
Yahiko!

1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:33.842
"The heart to live in authentic truth"?

1:23:35.969 --> 1:23:36.928
That's dumb.

1:23:46.271 --> 1:23:49.232
Are you Enishi Yukishiro?

1:23:50.567 --> 1:23:52.193
So what if I am?

1:23:53.319 --> 1:23:57.490
Killing Kenshin or me
won't bring Tomoe back.

1:23:58.074 --> 1:23:59.701
You just lose your soul…

1:24:01.619 --> 1:24:03.621
a prisoner of your rage.

1:24:03.705 --> 1:24:05.498
How do you know her?

1:24:14.507 --> 1:24:15.675
Did you hear that…

1:24:18.762 --> 1:24:20.430
from Battôsai?

1:24:22.223 --> 1:24:23.892
My sister's name?

1:26:02.407 --> 1:26:06.077
<i>Here, I shall levy man's judgment.</i>

1:29:12.138 --> 1:29:13.848
There's no escape.

1:29:17.018 --> 1:29:20.063
Man's judgment requires your death.

1:29:20.646 --> 1:29:23.816
Tomoe would not have wanted this.

1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:24.734
Silence.

1:29:26.319 --> 1:29:28.029
How would you know?

1:29:29.697 --> 1:29:30.531
Die!

1:29:31.866 --> 1:29:32.867
Die!

1:29:36.037 --> 1:29:37.914
You don't speak for her.

1:29:38.414 --> 1:29:39.624
Die!

1:29:41.584 --> 1:29:42.502
Die!

1:29:43.378 --> 1:29:45.421
Die!

1:29:50.385 --> 1:29:51.552
Die!

1:30:22.625 --> 1:30:23.668
Why?

1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:33.344
Why do you look so sad?

1:30:41.519 --> 1:30:43.688
Why won't you smile?

1:31:46.792 --> 1:31:52.048
TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH

1:31:58.346 --> 1:31:59.514
<i>The man I met</i>

1:32:00.598 --> 1:32:02.391
is a wanderer named Kenshin.

1:32:02.475 --> 1:32:05.311
Wandering is the easy way out.

1:32:05.394 --> 1:32:08.606
To help you out, why else?

1:32:09.190 --> 1:32:12.318
That sword is for you.

1:32:12.902 --> 1:32:17.573
Your life does not belong only to you.

1:32:17.657 --> 1:32:22.078
Worry about your own life
before someone else's.

1:32:22.787 --> 1:32:24.956
<i>I must not let him die now.</i>

1:32:26.165 --> 1:32:27.875
I will preserve him

1:32:29.126 --> 1:32:30.836
though it means my life.

1:32:55.653 --> 1:32:56.779
Kenshin!

1:33:06.372 --> 1:33:07.456
Are you going?

1:33:10.334 --> 1:33:11.419
Yahiko…

1:33:15.798 --> 1:33:17.049
look after Sano.

1:33:41.449 --> 1:33:43.909
The first one to find him kills him.

1:33:46.078 --> 1:33:47.455
All right?

1:33:49.957 --> 1:33:51.208
Suit yourself.

1:33:53.919 --> 1:33:54.754
Come on.

1:34:02.887 --> 1:34:04.013
You called?

1:34:07.183 --> 1:34:08.601
It's a bit soon,

1:34:10.019 --> 1:34:12.521
but the organization is yours.

1:34:13.814 --> 1:34:15.858
Why is that?

1:34:15.941 --> 1:34:18.069
My private war is almost over.

1:34:22.531 --> 1:34:26.619
It's not as easy as that, boss.

1:34:29.455 --> 1:34:32.458
The Japanese police
have gotten wind of this place.

1:34:33.209 --> 1:34:37.296
If you lose and they take you in again,
our government won't be--

1:34:37.380 --> 1:34:38.214
Heixing!

1:34:44.762 --> 1:34:46.305
What did you say?

1:34:48.391 --> 1:34:51.519
Do you think I might lose?

1:34:51.602 --> 1:34:53.437
No, never.

1:34:58.567 --> 1:34:59.819
Get out of here.

1:35:00.569 --> 1:35:03.114
One more word, and I'll kill you too!

1:35:22.633 --> 1:35:24.552
Are you turning tail?

1:35:24.635 --> 1:35:25.511
Shut up!

1:35:26.095 --> 1:35:29.849
We'll kill Battôsai,
and then Yukishiro too.

1:35:31.100 --> 1:35:32.184
Mr. Wu…

1:35:36.897 --> 1:35:39.275
Thank you for your help in Kyoto.

1:35:40.776 --> 1:35:43.404
I understand you might have
some work for me.

1:35:58.210 --> 1:36:00.087
You! Halt!

1:36:01.464 --> 1:36:02.506
Halt!

1:36:17.772 --> 1:36:19.607
So you're Battôsai?

1:36:20.191 --> 1:36:21.859
We've been waiting.

1:38:44.293 --> 1:38:45.419
Himura!

1:38:45.502 --> 1:38:47.963
Don't go keeping this to yourself!

1:38:50.549 --> 1:38:51.592
Ms. Misao!

1:38:51.675 --> 1:38:56.472
For Aoshi Shinomori,
Captain of the Edo Hidden Watchers,

1:38:56.555 --> 1:38:59.892
Misao Makimachi stands with you!

1:39:11.195 --> 1:39:12.488
This is my job.

1:39:15.199 --> 1:39:16.617
Kenshin!

1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:17.534
Sano?

1:39:17.618 --> 1:39:19.536
Out of the way!

1:39:35.803 --> 1:39:38.722
Kenshin, go!

1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:41.517
Go, Himura!

1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:57.157
Go!

1:40:23.767 --> 1:40:24.935
Damn it!

1:40:25.019 --> 1:40:26.770
Go around!

1:40:42.828 --> 1:40:45.247
I don't have time to play now.

1:40:46.248 --> 1:40:47.499
"Play"?

1:40:48.083 --> 1:40:49.209
How dare you!

1:40:50.502 --> 1:40:53.130
I hold the trump card here!

1:40:56.425 --> 1:41:00.971
The greatest of the Ten Swords
assassins, Sojiro Seta!

1:41:01.055 --> 1:41:03.807
Do your worst!

1:41:04.641 --> 1:41:05.934
You!

1:41:07.644 --> 1:41:10.731
It's been a while, Mr. Himura.

1:41:29.541 --> 1:41:31.835
Hey! What are you doing?

1:41:33.003 --> 1:41:34.880
I became a wanderer too.

1:41:35.506 --> 1:41:39.093
After Mr. Himura beat me,
my life lost meaning.

1:41:42.387 --> 1:41:44.515
It's been a while since I drew a sword,

1:41:45.516 --> 1:41:47.518
but I'm probably better than you.

1:41:48.769 --> 1:41:51.939
Get them! Kill them both!

1:44:00.776 --> 1:44:02.152
That was fun.

1:44:03.695 --> 1:44:08.200
It's nice not having to worry about
your back for a change.

1:44:20.545 --> 1:44:22.756
Go on ahead, Mr. Himura.

1:44:23.590 --> 1:44:25.217
And show me

1:44:25.717 --> 1:44:31.807
how that sword cuts old hatreds
and frees those trapped in the past.

1:44:34.476 --> 1:44:35.727
I thank you.

1:45:19.104 --> 1:45:19.938
Come on.

1:46:39.643 --> 1:46:40.685
So you're here…

1:46:43.355 --> 1:46:44.689
Battôsai.

1:46:47.776 --> 1:46:48.944
Sorry to keep you.

1:46:52.364 --> 1:46:53.740
Where's Ms. Kaoru?

1:46:54.825 --> 1:46:55.784
Indeed…

1:46:57.786 --> 1:46:58.870
I wonder.

1:47:02.749 --> 1:47:03.917
Enishi,

1:47:07.087 --> 1:47:12.050
it's perfectly natural
you'd want to avenge your sister.

1:47:13.343 --> 1:47:16.388
But stop pulling other people into it.

1:47:18.056 --> 1:47:20.058
Your enemy is me alone.

1:47:20.892 --> 1:47:22.519
I alone bear the guilt.

1:47:22.602 --> 1:47:23.562
Shut up!

1:47:25.313 --> 1:47:28.150
It's not you alone. It's all of you.

1:47:29.192 --> 1:47:33.655
Your friends, everyone you talk to,

1:47:34.531 --> 1:47:37.659
and all of this shit country you've made!

1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:50.005
Tomoe…

1:47:52.257 --> 1:47:54.509
the time has come at last.

1:48:18.074 --> 1:48:21.786
Man's judgment is at hand.

1:51:08.578 --> 1:51:09.996
Well, Battôsai?

1:51:12.707 --> 1:51:15.043
Does your wound hurt like my sister's?

1:51:23.218 --> 1:51:27.931
I'm damn sure it doesn't!

1:52:17.439 --> 1:52:19.023
Die!

1:52:26.823 --> 1:52:31.828
Only death can repay the sin of murder.

1:52:32.412 --> 1:52:36.750
Writhe in agony,
and die in regret and despair!

1:52:36.833 --> 1:52:39.627
That is the only way you can atone!

1:52:47.761 --> 1:52:48.887
Stand up!

1:52:51.973 --> 1:52:53.767
This does not

1:52:55.101 --> 1:52:57.604
atone for your crime.

1:53:01.733 --> 1:53:03.526
Stand up, Battôsai!

1:53:21.419 --> 1:53:22.629
What's wrong?

1:53:25.381 --> 1:53:26.883
Can't take any more?

1:53:30.345 --> 1:53:31.888
Then kill yourself.

1:53:34.474 --> 1:53:38.520
Turn that phony back-blade on yourself

1:53:39.979 --> 1:53:41.481
and die.

1:53:51.783 --> 1:53:52.951
Bastard.

1:53:55.119 --> 1:54:00.416
You kill more than you can count,
and you're afraid to kill yourself?

1:54:07.131 --> 1:54:08.758
Battôsai!

1:54:14.347 --> 1:54:16.349
I've thought about death many times.

1:54:19.769 --> 1:54:23.690
But I knew my death
would never atone for my sins.

1:54:25.984 --> 1:54:27.443
Quit your babbling.

1:54:29.279 --> 1:54:31.781
I still have no idea…

1:54:35.785 --> 1:54:37.203
how to atone.

1:54:44.377 --> 1:54:45.628
But now…

1:54:50.300 --> 1:54:51.676
for my friends…

1:54:55.847 --> 1:54:58.975
and for the peace that Tomoe wanted…

1:55:04.689 --> 1:55:05.690
Enishi…

1:55:08.401 --> 1:55:09.861
I have to stop you.

1:55:26.836 --> 1:55:27.837
Enishi…

1:55:30.131 --> 1:55:32.091
do you see Tomoe…

1:55:34.844 --> 1:55:36.512
smiling now?

1:57:15.778 --> 1:57:18.656
How could my sister fall for you?

1:57:52.273 --> 1:57:55.193
Your feelings for her are not wrong.

1:57:57.361 --> 1:58:00.198
Nor is your hatred for me.

1:58:02.116 --> 1:58:04.744
But the way you are living

1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:08.081
is very wrong.

1:58:12.919 --> 1:58:14.545
End this.

1:58:48.746 --> 1:58:49.664
Tomoe…

1:59:05.054 --> 1:59:06.180
Tomoe…

1:59:26.659 --> 1:59:29.078
Battôsai!

1:59:43.926 --> 1:59:45.011
Damn you!

1:59:53.519 --> 1:59:54.687
Enishi…

1:59:59.233 --> 2:00:00.651
I'm sorry.

2:00:16.250 --> 2:00:18.377
You think I'm some kind of joke!

2:00:19.086 --> 2:00:20.254
I'll kill you!

2:00:20.338 --> 2:00:21.547
-All of you!
-No!

2:00:26.928 --> 2:00:28.179
Keep out of my way.

2:00:44.070 --> 2:00:45.238
Bastard!

2:00:47.782 --> 2:00:48.741
Heixing!

2:00:52.411 --> 2:00:54.413
Don't get in my way!

2:01:02.630 --> 2:01:03.673
No!

2:01:04.674 --> 2:01:05.758
Stop!

2:01:06.342 --> 2:01:08.928
You'll kill him!

2:01:09.804 --> 2:01:11.055
You will!

2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:23.484
Thank you for protecting…

2:01:25.611 --> 2:01:26.737
Ms. Kaoru.

2:01:36.622 --> 2:01:37.832
No…

2:01:41.460 --> 2:01:42.295
No!

2:01:42.378 --> 2:01:43.379
Kenshin.

2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:47.717
I wanted to protect…

2:01:52.930 --> 2:01:55.516
The one I wanted to protect…

2:03:02.083 --> 2:03:03.250
Tomoe!

2:03:07.171 --> 2:03:09.173
Damn it!

2:03:13.177 --> 2:03:14.512
Damn it!

2:04:25.249 --> 2:04:26.333
Enishi Yukishiro,

2:04:27.334 --> 2:04:28.586
this came for you.

2:04:32.798 --> 2:04:37.052
TO ENISHI YUKISHIRO
APPROVED BY CENSOR

2:04:49.356 --> 2:04:53.611
THIS DIARY SHOULD BE WITH YOU

2:04:53.694 --> 2:04:58.073
FOR YOUR SISTER'S SAKE,
I PRAY THAT YOU WILL LIVE

2:05:06.665 --> 2:05:10.085
KAORU KAMIYA

2:05:48.958 --> 2:05:53.462
<i>He is the man who robbed me</i>
<i>of my happiness</i>

2:05:55.005 --> 2:05:59.718
<i>and the man who brought me happiness anew.</i>

2:06:01.679 --> 2:06:05.891
<i>He will kill again.</i>

2:06:07.184 --> 2:06:10.271
<i>But after all his killing is done,</i>

2:06:11.313 --> 2:06:16.485
<i>I am sure he will preserve</i>
<i>many more than he has killed.</i>

2:06:20.990 --> 2:06:23.325
<i>I must not let him die now.</i>

2:06:50.102 --> 2:06:51.687
<i>I will preserve him…</i>

2:06:53.647 --> 2:06:55.316
<i>though it means my life.</i>

2:07:04.950 --> 2:07:10.539
I WILL PRESERVE HIM
THOUGH IT MEANS MY LIFE

2:08:09.807 --> 2:08:10.766
-Ten!
-Ten!

2:08:12.393 --> 2:08:13.227
-One!
-One!

2:08:14.728 --> 2:08:15.729
-Two!
-Two!

2:08:17.106 --> 2:08:18.107
-Three!
-Three!

2:08:18.190 --> 2:08:19.733
THE HEART TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH

2:08:19.817 --> 2:08:20.776
-Four!
-Four!

2:08:22.319 --> 2:08:23.195
-Five!
-Five!

2:08:24.655 --> 2:08:25.614
-Six!
-Six!

2:08:39.503 --> 2:08:41.130
Don't overdo it.

2:08:41.714 --> 2:08:43.424
Be quiet.

2:08:47.761 --> 2:08:49.096
That hurt!

2:08:53.434 --> 2:08:54.768
Don't overdo it.

2:09:23.172 --> 2:09:24.715
What did you tell Tomoe?

2:09:28.427 --> 2:09:30.429
Thank you, I guess.

2:09:33.766 --> 2:09:37.019
In the end, Enishi saved me.

2:09:40.105 --> 2:09:41.857
But now I think maybe

2:09:43.650 --> 2:09:46.320
it was Tomoe watching over me.

2:09:51.408 --> 2:09:52.993
Enishi Yukishiro…

2:09:55.954 --> 2:09:57.581
I wonder how he's doing.

2:10:01.543 --> 2:10:04.087
He will have to atone as well.

2:10:09.676 --> 2:10:11.094
Not with his death,

2:10:12.888 --> 2:10:14.389
but with his life.

2:10:16.725 --> 2:10:18.060
Until he does that…

2:10:20.562 --> 2:10:23.357
the Tomoe in his mind will not smile.

2:10:51.260 --> 2:10:52.469
Kenshin…

2:10:54.680 --> 2:10:57.558
what did you say to Tomoe?

2:11:01.979 --> 2:11:04.022
The same as you.

2:11:06.358 --> 2:11:07.401
Thank you.

2:11:10.362 --> 2:11:11.572
And

2:11:13.031 --> 2:11:14.616
I'm sorry, and…

2:11:21.331 --> 2:11:22.499
goodbye.

2:17:18.855 --> 2:17:21.691
