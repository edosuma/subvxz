Armando?

One second, princess.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.540
I'm just having
a little trouble with the...

01:27.380 --> 01:29.500
Nice shot, Elena.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.710
Thanks, abuelo.

01:30.710 --> 01:33.540
Do you mind keeping it down?

01:33.540 --> 01:36.330
I'm trying to take
a nap over here.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.790
Oh, sorry, Skylar.

01:37.790 --> 01:40.210
This is my first time
at King Hector's royal retreat.

01:40.210 --> 01:41.790
I have to prepare.

01:41.790 --> 01:45.460
And the rest of us have to
prepare for our vacation.

01:45.460 --> 01:47.880
I hope we get to see
some marposas.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.920
According to my book,
they live in these waters.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.290
Ooh, maybe I can hear them
whistling with my magnaphone.

01:53.290 --> 01:56.250
Good idea, Isabel.
Pull!

01:59.830 --> 02:02.000
Wait. Look over there.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.420
Marposas!

02:07.710 --> 02:09.330
Whoa!

02:09.330 --> 02:10.710
They're beautiful.

02:10.710 --> 02:12.710
Oh, don't go.

02:12.710 --> 02:15.080
Oh, I wish I could
get a closer look.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.710
Maybe they'll
come back later.

02:16.710 --> 02:19.080
Well, that's enough
practice, Armando.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.580
I think I'm ready.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.460
Thank you.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.750
Okay.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.330
I know all the kings,

02:26.330 --> 02:27.920
I've read up on
their kingdoms,

02:27.920 --> 02:30.500
I have my royal gifts.
Ready to go, Skylar?

02:30.500 --> 02:31.920
Go

02:31.920 --> 02:33.460
To the retreat.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.040
I thought
we'd fly in. Yes!

02:35.040 --> 02:37.790
I think we should
drop you off

02:37.790 --> 02:40.750
so I can introduce you
to all the kings.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.880
Oh, I agree.
Francisco's right.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.330
Oh, that's sweet,

02:44.330 --> 02:46.040
but you have a vacation
to get to.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.290
Come on, Skylar.

02:47.290 --> 02:48.880
What about my vacation?

02:48.880 --> 02:50.960
She'll be fine,
Francisco.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.710
Okay.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.500
Just remember, Elena,

02:54.500 --> 02:56.620
not all rulers
act the same way we do.

02:56.620 --> 02:58.880
If you need anything,

02:58.880 --> 03:01.210
we will just be
on the other side
of the island.

03:01.210 --> 03:02.210
Great.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.420
See you after
the retreat.

03:06.420 --> 03:10.330
Okay, I guess
we're doing this.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.670
Adios, vacation.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.960
Whoa! Those are
some fancy ships.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.290
ELENA: And fancy kings.

03:23.290 --> 03:26.380
Yeah, well, you're
one fancy princesa,

03:26.380 --> 03:29.120
and I'm
an even fancier jaquin.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.670
Hold on.

03:33.750 --> 03:36.670
Check out the plumage,
amigos!

03:39.170 --> 03:41.880
Now that is
a royal entrance.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.710
Thanks, Skylar.

03:45.170 --> 03:48.830
Hi. I'm Princess Elena
of Avalor.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.040
King Joaquin
of Cariza.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.830
I'm so glad
you could join us.

03:52.830 --> 03:55.670
I am King Lars
from Maarswik.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.920
And I am King Raja
of Napurna.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.710
It's an honor
to be invited.

03:59.710 --> 04:01.500
I can't wait
to meet our host.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.330
Yes. Uh, I should
probably warn you

04:06.330 --> 04:08.790
that King Hector
can be a bit--

04:08.790 --> 04:10.620
- Bossy.
- Pushy.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.080
I was going to say
difficult.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.790
But he always gives out
very generous gifts

04:13.790 --> 04:14.790
at the end
of the retreat.

04:14.790 --> 04:16.330
Last year,

04:16.330 --> 04:18.170
he gave us
a summer castle.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.710
And the year before that,

04:19.710 --> 04:22.080
we got our very own
private island.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.880
I wonder what he'll
give us this year.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.040
Wouldn't you
like to know?!

04:25.040 --> 04:27.170
Ah, King Hector.

04:27.170 --> 04:29.380
Joaquin! What up?

04:29.380 --> 04:32.790
This retreat
is for rulers only.

04:32.790 --> 04:34.920
Hector,
this is Elena,

04:34.920 --> 04:36.750
the crown princess
of Avalor.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.920
Oh, wow, I know that.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.920
I was just kiddin'.
Works every time.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.960
He did that to all of us
on our first time
at the retreat.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.750
That joke
never gets old.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.120
It sure doesn't.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.460
Raja, Lars, get over
here, you knuckleheads.

04:51.830 --> 04:54.880
How are you boys
enjoying your summer castles?

04:54.880 --> 04:57.210
With a joy
beyond measure.

04:57.210 --> 04:59.920
Yes. Thank you for
giving them to us.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.750
Well, it's nothing compared
to this year's gift.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.790
Behold, my indestructible
eight series ship,

05:05.790 --> 05:08.620
the Sea Blaster!

05:08.620 --> 05:09.750
Comes complete with
automatic sails,

05:09.750 --> 05:12.380
bowling alley on deck,
and the topper,

05:12.380 --> 05:15.830
a solid gold statue
of yours truly on the prow.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.210
You play your cards
right, Elena,

05:17.210 --> 05:19.380
and you won't have to
fly in on that beast.

05:19.380 --> 05:20.580
Who's he calling a beast?

05:20.580 --> 05:23.580
Skylar is not a beast.
He's a jaquin.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.500
Yeah, I know.
I got a zoo full of 'em.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.330
Just kidding.

05:27.330 --> 05:29.500
If you're gonna be
at my retreat, Elena,

05:29.500 --> 05:32.120
you'll have to learn
how to take a joke.
Not like these two.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.380
King Hector,
am I imagining things,

05:34.380 --> 05:37.500
or is your resort
even more beautiful
than last year?

05:37.500 --> 05:39.920
I renovated
the entire island.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.040
Had to find something to do
with all my money.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.380
ELENA: You can always
build roads.

05:44.380 --> 05:46.080
- Or schools.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.380
Why would I build
a school?

05:48.380 --> 05:50.290
I graduated years ago,
as far as you know.

05:50.290 --> 05:52.880
How about giving us
a tour of the island, Hector?

05:52.880 --> 05:55.120
Hey, thought you'd
never ask, Joaquin.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.670
We can start with
my new aquarium,

05:56.670 --> 05:58.290
which is filled with
sea creatures

05:58.290 --> 06:01.170
I have personally
captured all over the world,

06:01.170 --> 06:02.880
most of 'em underwater.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.000
It is even more beautiful
than I remember.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.920
I hope Elena
is okay.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.710
Stop worrying, Francisco.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.920
I told you
she'll be fine.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.750
Let's go see
the waterfall.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.790
I'd rather stay
and look for marposas,
if that's okay.

06:24.790 --> 06:27.290
Of course.
Now come on.

06:27.290 --> 06:29.170
Let's walk off
those worries.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.920
The chairs
are all set up.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.790
Where'd they go?

06:36.790 --> 06:41.460
Oh, well, I can't let
such a cozy chair go to waste.

06:42.830 --> 06:44.750
ISABEL:
Armando!

06:44.750 --> 06:47.920
It says marposas
come to this island
to lay their eggs.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.750
Um, big purple ones?

06:49.750 --> 06:50.880
How did you
know that?

06:50.880 --> 06:52.960
They're all over
the beach.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.080
Ooh. Let's see if we can
find a baby.

06:55.080 --> 06:58.920
Sure. Right after
a little siesta.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.830
- Come on.
- Aaahh!

07:00.830 --> 07:02.710
Or now is good.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.380
And this little nook,
I like to call

07:09.380 --> 07:11.120
the feasting hall.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.330
What a host!

07:12.330 --> 07:14.380
What a tour!

07:16.750 --> 07:18.000
Take a seat, everyone.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.580
Prepare for the feast
of your lifetimes.

07:20.580 --> 07:21.750
Ah-ah-ah.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.500
That throne is for
the Rajinator.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.170
Oh, sorry.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.380
Larzipan,
you sit there.

07:31.380 --> 07:34.290
Of course,
King Hector.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.120
I'll just take this one.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.710
Nope. That one's for
Joaquini-Bonini.

07:43.710 --> 07:45.460
Oh, that's okay.
Hector, I...

07:45.460 --> 07:47.080
Sit!

07:47.080 --> 07:49.920
Um, where's my throne?

07:49.920 --> 07:52.750
They must've forgotten
to set one out for you, Elena.

07:54.330 --> 07:55.620
Hey, bring another chair!

08:00.710 --> 08:02.710
All right then.
Shall we begin?

08:02.710 --> 08:05.040
I have royal gifts
for everyone.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.580
Handmade shears,
Avaloran chocolate. Oh!

08:08.580 --> 08:11.330
Oh, I love
Avaloran chocolate.

08:11.330 --> 08:12.790
HECTOR:
Ahem!

08:12.790 --> 08:14.420
That's wonderful,
princess,

08:14.420 --> 08:16.210
but, see, royal gifts
are not distributed

08:16.210 --> 08:17.920
until the end
of the retreat.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.080
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.880
Your Majesties,
the buffet is served.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.710
Don't worry.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.790
King Hector's hard on
all the new rulers.

08:30.790 --> 08:32.960
- Oh, yeah.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.830
My first retreat,
there wasn't a seat
for me in the whole resort.

08:35.830 --> 08:37.380
I had to stand
the entire time.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.500
That's terrible.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.380
That's what I thought
until he gave me
a private island.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.830

10:47.080 --> 10:48.710
ALL: We are!

10:48.710 --> 10:50.790
- I guess I am too.

10:50.790 --> 10:52.710
- Come quick.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.880
My ship!

10:58.880 --> 11:01.750
My Seven Cities
Ocean Stream ship!

11:01.750 --> 11:02.830
What happened?

11:02.830 --> 11:04.330
That sea creature
rammed it.

11:05.710 --> 11:07.500
Not just any
sea creature, boys.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.460
That's a marposa.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.290
What? That doesn't
make any sense.

11:11.290 --> 11:12.710
My family and I saw
a whole pod

11:12.710 --> 11:15.460
on the voyage here,
but they were friendly.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.920
Does that look
friendly to you?

11:19.920 --> 11:22.080
- No, but--
- To the command center.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.750
- We must devise
a plan of attack.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.750
King Hector, I know
I'm a new ruler,

11:27.750 --> 11:29.500
but maybe there's
another way.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.880
There's only one way
to deal with a creature
like that, Elena.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.120
My way.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.790
Perhaps we should
think this through, Hector.

11:35.790 --> 11:37.000
So let me
get it straight.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.830
What you're saying is
you don't want

11:38.830 --> 11:40.710
my new Sea Blaster ship.

11:40.710 --> 11:42.670
Let's start
planning that attack.

11:42.670 --> 11:44.040
- Glad you agree.
- But I don't know--

11:44.040 --> 11:47.040
Elena, you said
you had family nearby.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.790
I do.

11:48.790 --> 11:50.920
Okay, why don't you
check on them

11:50.920 --> 11:51.790
and make sure they're safe.

11:51.790 --> 11:53.880
Right.
Of course.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.330
Good. Now we can plan
our attack in peace.
Come on, boys.

12:05.170 --> 12:06.790
Ooh, over there.

12:06.790 --> 12:09.210
See those cracks?
I think it might hatch soon.

12:09.210 --> 12:11.040
ELENA: Isabel!

12:11.040 --> 12:12.380
Elena!

12:12.380 --> 12:14.580
Is everyone
all right here?

12:14.580 --> 12:15.920
We're fine. Why?

12:15.920 --> 12:18.330
A marposa attacked
King Raja's ship.

12:18.330 --> 12:20.500
That doesn't make
any sense.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.250
My book says they're harmless,

12:22.250 --> 12:24.120
and stay way out at sea,
except...

12:24.120 --> 12:25.920
Except when?

12:25.920 --> 12:28.750
When the female marposa
comes to shore to lay her eggs.

12:28.750 --> 12:32.080
It says here that
baby marposas get very upset

12:32.080 --> 12:33.920
if they're separated
from their mothers.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.460
They thrash around
because they're scared.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.670
They can even
be dangerous,

12:38.670 --> 12:40.920
but they calm right down
once they find their mom.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.460
So maybe the marposa
that destroyed the ship

12:45.460 --> 12:47.830
was a baby
separated from its mother.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.880
It must've happened
after it hatched.

12:51.330 --> 12:53.880
Because when the baby
is with its mom,

12:53.880 --> 12:56.500
it's happy,
like that one.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.120
BOTH: Awww!

12:58.120 --> 13:00.460
So we have to find
the marposa's mother.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.210
But how?

13:02.210 --> 13:03.920
Hm. They communicate
by whistling.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.170
If the mom is looking
for her baby,

13:06.170 --> 13:07.790
she'd be whistling.

13:07.790 --> 13:10.210
Maybe your magnaphone
can help us locate her.

13:10.210 --> 13:12.380
Great idea.
Here, take it.

13:12.380 --> 13:15.380
But first I have
to tell the other kings
it's just a baby.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.500
Armando, did you see
the marposa?

13:21.500 --> 13:23.670
Uh-huh.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.670
And it sure saw me.

13:30.790 --> 13:32.710
We are gonna lure
the creature out to sea
and capture it, yes!

13:32.710 --> 13:33.710
Now let's cast off.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.040
King Hector, wait!

13:45.040 --> 13:46.880
Oh, back so soon?

13:46.880 --> 13:48.920
You have to stop
the attack.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.540
I think the marposa
is just a scared baby.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.080
If we help it
find its mother,

13:53.080 --> 13:54.710
it'll leave
your ships alone.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.670
Men, let's get
that net set up.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.420
You have to listen
to me, King Hector.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.620
No. You have to listen
to me.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.920
But what you're doing
is wrong.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.620
Larzipan, do you
think I'm wrong?

14:05.620 --> 14:07.330
- Of course not.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.710
You've never been wrong
about anything.

14:09.710 --> 14:11.000
Bonini?

14:13.380 --> 14:15.620
I know I'm right
about this, Joaquin.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.540
You have to
believe me.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.500
You want that ship, don't you?
Are you in or out?

14:19.500 --> 14:22.380
I'm in.

14:22.380 --> 14:23.920
Elena, are you
in or out?

14:23.920 --> 14:25.670
I'm out.

14:25.670 --> 14:27.670
Let's go, Skylar.

14:29.540 --> 14:32.580
- Not yet.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.580
Maybe we should
go back the other way.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.580
- Wait.

14:39.830 --> 14:41.710
Do you hear that?

14:41.710 --> 14:43.540
Sounds like
a marposa to me.

14:43.540 --> 14:44.830
It's the same whistle
as the baby.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.460
It must be the mother.

14:46.460 --> 14:49.290
It's coming from
that little island.

14:49.290 --> 14:51.330
Let's check it out.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.920
There.
She's trapped in those roots.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.080
SKYLAR: That would explain
why the baby's alone.

15:07.380 --> 15:08.960
It won't budge.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.920
Do you think you can
pull it loose, Skylar?

15:10.920 --> 15:13.210
You got it, princesa.

15:16.620 --> 15:18.880
I am a mighty jaquin.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.920
You will not break me.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.790
I will break you!

15:25.170 --> 15:27.710
Ow! Splinter,
splinter, splinter!

15:30.920 --> 15:33.790
There it is,
off the starboard bow.

15:36.170 --> 15:38.290
Ready the net!

15:44.880 --> 15:47.880
Okay, root, I am
forced to use

15:47.880 --> 15:50.380
the most powerful weapon
at my disposal.

15:50.380 --> 15:51.880
Your claws?

15:51.880 --> 15:53.670
My mouth.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.750
It's moving!

15:58.750 --> 16:00.830
You almost got it, Skylar.
Pull!

16:03.830 --> 16:06.120
Ow. My wings.

16:09.580 --> 16:11.120
You did it!

16:17.580 --> 16:19.920
Now let's lead her
to her baby.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.170
Okay.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.710
Ow!

16:25.710 --> 16:27.330
Are you okay?

16:27.330 --> 16:29.620
I banged up my wing,
but I think
I'll be all right.

16:29.620 --> 16:32.790
Come on, marposa.
Follow me.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.120
- It's the baby!

16:41.120 --> 16:43.080
She found her baby.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.460
Oh, it's gonna be all right.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.120
Look. Another marposa.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.040
That must be the mother;
Elena was right.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.750
Men, lower the net.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.880
But the baby isn't
a threat anymore.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.000
It's calm.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.120
Yeah, which'll make it
that much easier

17:05.120 --> 17:07.540
to capture for
my aquarium.

17:07.540 --> 17:10.460
So this wasn't about
protecting our ships?

17:10.460 --> 17:13.580
This was just about
having another sea creature

17:13.580 --> 17:14.750
to show off
in your aquarium?

17:14.750 --> 17:17.620
No, another two
sea creatures.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.080
We'll capture
the baby and the mother.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.710
That's not right.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.540
You can't do this.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.790
It's already done.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.000
Drag the net.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.620
What are they doing?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.620
We have to stop them,
Skylar.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.790
Oh, we will.
Ow.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.330
Ow, ow.

17:39.330 --> 17:41.920
My wing hurts too much.
I have to land.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.750
ELENA: Uh... oh, down there
on that driftwood.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.330
I'm sorry, princesa.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.170
It doesn't matter.

17:52.170 --> 17:54.170
We're too late.

17:54.170 --> 17:55.710
I'll get us to shore.

18:07.790 --> 18:09.460
Rest here, okay?

18:09.460 --> 18:10.880
I'll go get some help.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.040
Joaquin?

18:13.040 --> 18:16.040
I should have listened to you
from the beginning, Elena.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.380
Perhaps I've spent
so much time

18:18.380 --> 18:20.880
following Hector's lead,
I forgot that true leadership

18:20.880 --> 18:23.210
is about standing up for
what you believe is right.

18:23.210 --> 18:25.580
I appreciate that.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.120
But Hector has
the marposa.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.540
What else can we do?

18:28.540 --> 18:30.290
Exactly what
you've been doing.

18:30.290 --> 18:32.750
Fight for what we know
is right.

18:32.750 --> 18:35.290
I tried that,
and I failed.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.920
Then you must do
what all great leaders do

18:37.920 --> 18:39.790
after they fail.

18:39.790 --> 18:45.710
- Try again.

18:45.710 --> 18:49.620
I'll need your help,
and your row boat.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.080
Bring it out on the deck.

19:03.830 --> 19:05.710
- SAILOR: It's the mother!

19:12.040 --> 19:14.880
Get that creature onboard
so we can catch the mother.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.380
Perhaps we should
just let it go, Hector.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.790
I agree.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.750
Do you really need
another sea creature

19:21.750 --> 19:23.210
in your aquarium?

19:23.210 --> 19:24.960
Do you really need
my Sea Blaster ship?

19:24.960 --> 19:27.210
'Cause if you want it,
you'll do what I tell you.

19:27.210 --> 19:29.000
Look at that.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.750
Whoa. I thought
the Sea Blaster
was indestructible.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.290
I have a plan.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.000
Okay, I'll go
distract them.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.420
And I'll do the rest.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.750
King Hector!

19:46.750 --> 19:48.330
About time
you showed up.

19:48.330 --> 19:50.120
The other marposa
knocked a hole in your ship.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.380
Impossible.

19:52.380 --> 19:55.290
Forget about
the creature, men.

19:55.290 --> 19:57.500
Patch up my ship at once!

20:04.080 --> 20:06.250
Don't worry. I'm gonna
get you back in the water.

20:18.790 --> 20:20.880
What do you think
you're doing?

20:20.880 --> 20:22.880
Freeing the marposa.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.250
Get away from
that crank.

20:26.670 --> 20:28.120
Is now a good time
to take out

20:28.120 --> 20:29.920
our royal gifts,
King Hector?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.790
If you cut that net,
you are out of the club.

20:32.790 --> 20:34.880
You'll never be
one of the kings.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.830
I don't need to be
one of the kings.

20:36.830 --> 20:39.540
I'm going to be queen!

20:44.000 --> 20:45.880
Oh!

20:45.880 --> 20:47.880
I want all of you
off my ship.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.540
You might wanna get
off your ship, too.
It's sinking.

20:56.330 --> 20:59.000
Your Majesty, you should
come with us before it sinks.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.830
This ship will not sink.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.920
Do you hear me?

21:02.920 --> 21:05.460
This is a top-of-the-line
Sea Blaster.

21:05.460 --> 21:08.080
Whoa! Make room for me!

21:16.170 --> 21:19.380
I'm glad we don't have
to listen to Hector anymore.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.750
But what about
the royal retreat?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.750
We can have our own.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.710
- Hmm.

21:25.710 --> 21:28.290
Please sit.

21:28.290 --> 21:30.750
There's a seat
for everyone.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.120
Oh, because you did not
have one before...

21:33.120 --> 21:34.880
very good!

21:34.880 --> 21:37.250
Who would like
some Avaloran chocolate?

21:37.250 --> 21:39.830
Lars, I know you do.

21:39.830 --> 21:41.880
I certainly do.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.120
Thank you for
hosting us here.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.880
We are delighted
to have you.

21:45.880 --> 21:49.120
Your granddaughter is
a wonderful crown princess.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.750
See? I told you
you had nothing
to worry about.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.920
Ay, Francisco!

21:54.920 --> 21:57.210
Look! It's the marposa
mom and her baby!
