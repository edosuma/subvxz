00:07.090 --> 00:09.081
For those of you just joining us...

00:09.259 --> 00:11.693
...what you're looking at
is the work of ZFT...

00:11.861 --> 00:16.594
...a terrorist organization responsible for
at least half a dozen biological attacks.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.757
Everything we know,
in your packets...

00:18.935 --> 00:22.769
...including a copy of their manifesto,
their ideology and their methods.

00:22.939 --> 00:27.239
Destruction by technology,
which boils down to the following:

00:27.410 --> 00:29.571
Attempting to provoke
or prepare for war.

00:29.746 --> 00:33.682
- War? With whom?
- That's the question, isn't it?

00:33.850 --> 00:37.286
What we do know is these acts
seem to be increasing in frequency.

00:37.454 --> 00:41.185
And that their targets are unpredictable
and therefore unprotectable.

00:41.357 --> 00:43.416
Taxi! Taxi!

00:48.398 --> 00:52.266
Evidence suggests
ZFT is funded by an unlikely source...

00:52.435 --> 00:54.699
...and a name I'm sure
you've all heard of.

00:54.871 --> 00:57.203
William Bell,
founder of Massive Dynamic.

00:57.574 --> 01:00.805
Wait, wait! Hold the bus!

01:04.114 --> 01:06.082
You go up Park?
Past Lenox Hill Hospital?

01:06.249 --> 01:08.240
Yes, six stops away.
Are you feeling okay?

01:08.418 --> 01:10.818
Fine. Just go, please.

01:10.987 --> 01:14.548
Those of you assembled in this room
now have a single clear-cut goal:

01:14.724 --> 01:16.385
To provide actionable evidence...

01:16.559 --> 01:18.993
...establishing a link
between Bell and ZFT.

01:19.195 --> 01:21.288
Agents Olivia Dunham
and Charlie Francis...

01:21.464 --> 01:23.830
...will be coordinating
the investigation.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.127
All efforts and information
go through them.

01:26.302 --> 01:28.236
Now let's go to work.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.135 --> 02:01.467
Stop the bus.
Stop, please, I have to get off.

02:01.638 --> 02:03.629
Ma'am, please sit.
I'm not allowed to...

02:03.807 --> 02:06.799
- Stop the bus. I have to get off now.
- Okay, okay.

02:07.777 --> 02:09.676
Open the door.

02:13.116 --> 02:16.108
Oh, my God, please.
Please help, somebody.

02:17.654 --> 02:19.849
Oh, my God. Oh, I can't breathe.

02:20.523 --> 02:22.491
Oh, my God.

02:24.227 --> 02:27.458
- Miss, you need some help?
- Lady, you okay?

02:28.264 --> 02:30.892
Yeah, 911? I'm standing on the...

03:06.836 --> 03:09.703
Find anything new in there, Walter?

03:10.340 --> 03:14.800
You've read the manifesto about a dozen
times cover to cover, so just wondering.

03:15.678 --> 03:18.203
I need to show you something, Peter.

03:27.223 --> 03:28.781
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.392
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

03:31.561 --> 03:33.051
Show and tell, apparently.

03:37.934 --> 03:40.903
What is this?
I don't know what I'm looking at.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.910
This typewriter is Belly's.

03:50.580 --> 03:53.378
I remember the day he purchased it.
It was raining.

03:53.549 --> 03:55.312
Do you understand
what you're saying?

03:55.485 --> 03:57.476
That William Bell
doesn't just fund ZFT...

03:57.654 --> 04:00.782
...he wrote their manifesto
and is responsible for everything?

04:00.957 --> 04:02.424
Absolutely not.

04:02.592 --> 04:04.924
William Bell was many things.

04:05.094 --> 04:09.554
He was ambitious, he was egotistical,
he was temperamental.

04:09.732 --> 04:11.427
But he wasn't a madman.

04:11.601 --> 04:14.331
Although the ideas in this manifesto
are radical...

04:14.504 --> 04:18.769
...he wouldn't do this.
These horrendous things.

04:19.274 --> 04:20.935
He would never do it.

04:21.110 --> 04:24.910
There are references all throughout
to the chapter of ethics...

04:25.081 --> 04:27.914
...but there is no such chapter.
It is missing.

04:28.084 --> 04:33.021
And I believe that someone has removed
it to suit their own evil purposes.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.656
- And I can prove it.
- How?

04:34.824 --> 04:37.292
Get another copy of the book.
With all the pages...

04:37.460 --> 04:39.428
There is no other copy.
This is the only one.

04:40.763 --> 04:42.094
- I'll get it.
- He wrote it here.

04:42.265 --> 04:46.964
In this lab. It could still be
here somewhere, the original.

04:47.136 --> 04:49.161
- And what if you're wrong?
- I'm not wrong.

04:49.339 --> 04:51.933
And when I find it, you will see.

04:52.108 --> 04:54.508
It will absolve him, Peter.

04:56.279 --> 04:58.645
Peter, it's Olivia.

05:00.950 --> 05:02.349
So this is what I got so far.

05:02.518 --> 05:06.852
Bus driver called 911. Reported
an agitated woman got off his bus.

05:07.023 --> 05:09.787
Moments later she caught fire
and exploded.

05:09.959 --> 05:11.153
Police combed the area...

05:11.327 --> 05:15.286
...they couldn't find any evidence
of an accelerant or an incendiary device.

05:15.465 --> 05:17.831
There's something strange
in your neighborhood.

05:18.001 --> 05:19.332
Who you gonna call?

05:19.502 --> 05:21.493
So, what do you make of this, Walter?

05:21.671 --> 05:23.696
Well, from what Agent Francis
described...

05:23.873 --> 05:28.401
...it's possible we're dealing with a
case of spontaneous human combustion.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.205
I thought that was just a myth.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.678
A myth is just an unverified fact.

05:32.849 --> 05:36.250
- Maybe she was hit by a tiny meteor.
- That's also possible.

05:36.452 --> 05:38.079
Until I get this body to the lab...

05:38.254 --> 05:40.654
...I won't be able to say anything
with certainty.

05:40.823 --> 05:42.916
I'll get the coroner to prep the bodies.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.890
Bodies? Is there another somewhere?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.695
You okay?

05:52.869 --> 05:54.200
Yeah, I just...

06:13.790 --> 06:15.348
Broyles.

06:18.027 --> 06:19.995
Send her in.

06:23.232 --> 06:25.792
- Philip.
- Nina.

06:26.002 --> 06:27.867
I won't play coy, Philip.

06:28.037 --> 06:31.768
I understand the FBI has opened
an investigation into Massive Dynamic.

06:31.941 --> 06:36.537
As you can imagine, we spend
a lot of money on counterintelligence.

06:36.712 --> 06:39.613
And any probe into our finances
raises red flags.

06:43.286 --> 06:46.278
So, what are you fishing for?

06:46.456 --> 06:49.482
Industrial espionage?
Treaty violations?

06:49.659 --> 06:52.219
We have evidence
that William Bell may be involved...

06:52.395 --> 06:55.558
...with several biological attacks
perpetrated this past year.

06:56.132 --> 06:59.067
- But that's ridiculous.
- Perhaps.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.327
But as long as you're here...

07:02.538 --> 07:05.234
...if you have something to offer,
now would be the time.

07:05.408 --> 07:08.844
I'm not one of your street thugs
that you can bully, Philip.

07:09.045 --> 07:13.175
- And William Bell is not a terrorist.
- I'd like to hear him tell me that himself.

07:13.349 --> 07:17.115
I'm afraid that's not possible.
He's traveling.

07:21.624 --> 07:25.822
You're wasting your time.
William Bell is not the enemy.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.664
Is there something else?

07:38.941 --> 07:42.377
Matter is just energy
waiting to happen.

07:43.012 --> 07:46.812
The average adult at rest
contains enough potential energy...

07:46.983 --> 07:50.783
...to explode with the force
of five very large hydrogen bombs.

07:50.953 --> 07:53.148
You know, theoretically,
you're actually right.

07:53.322 --> 07:56.519
Ha-ha-ha. My son finally agrees with me.

07:56.692 --> 08:00.219
- Agent Farnsworth, take a note of that.
- We're not good at releasing it.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.557
Well, it needs a spark,
of course, a trigger.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.529
What do you think released it in her?

08:04.700 --> 08:06.497
Some say a particle is to blame.

08:06.669 --> 08:09.331
The appropriately named pyroton.

08:09.505 --> 08:12.531
Maybe we could finally prove
that it exists.

08:12.708 --> 08:15.700
Peter, fire up the electron microscope.

08:15.878 --> 08:19.211
- I might have taken that apart.
- What on earth for?

08:19.382 --> 08:22.374
I needed the parts
for a project I'm working on.

08:24.387 --> 08:29.620
As I said, the potential for destruction
in each of us is infinite.

08:40.369 --> 08:42.667
Yes, Jim, I understand.

08:42.837 --> 08:43.861
Right away.

08:44.039 --> 08:46.941
I had you pegged
as a creature of habit. Heh.

08:49.378 --> 08:51.073
You changed your office.

08:51.247 --> 08:53.943
- Come again?
- Your desk. You've moved it.

08:58.421 --> 08:59.786
Uh, ahem.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.857
We know from the driver
what stop she got on.

09:03.025 --> 09:05.186
He's worked up
an artist's sketch rendering...

09:05.361 --> 09:08.023
...so we'll canvass the area,
see if we can ID her.

09:08.197 --> 09:09.926
What about the other victim?

09:10.099 --> 09:12.090
Did the bus driver
see her get on too?

09:12.602 --> 09:13.728
Were they not together?

09:14.937 --> 09:16.802
I'm sorry, you mean one.

09:17.406 --> 09:20.603
- There was only one victim.
- I'm confused.

09:39.595 --> 09:41.062
Agent Dunham?

09:47.103 --> 09:48.331
Where are we on this?

09:51.741 --> 09:56.075
The bus driver remembered
what stop she, uh...

09:57.580 --> 10:03.246
What stop she got on.
He gave us an artist's sketch rendering.

10:03.419 --> 10:06.479
We're gonna show it around
and see if we can ID her.

10:06.656 --> 10:08.817
- What the hell is going on here?
- Sanford.

10:08.991 --> 10:13.325
Why is the entire 13th floor trying to link
William Bell to biological terror attacks?

10:13.496 --> 10:15.964
- We have evidence Bell...
- I know what you have.

10:16.132 --> 10:18.930
Testimony from a dead man
who was an admitted terrorist.

10:19.101 --> 10:21.695
Well, his testimony confirms
what we've long suspected.

10:21.871 --> 10:26.137
Massive Dynamic may be involved
or behind events we've been witnessing.

10:26.309 --> 10:28.004
William Bell and Massive Dynamic...

10:28.177 --> 10:31.271
...are the Defense Department's
largest contractors.

10:31.447 --> 10:34.143
These waters are much too deep
for a fishing expedition.

10:34.317 --> 10:36.444
Are you seriously suggesting
we ignore...?

10:36.619 --> 10:39.850
I am telling you to drop this,
considering you have nothing more...

10:40.022 --> 10:43.822
...than an unsubstantiated report
from a hostile source. Clear?

10:52.802 --> 10:55.498
- Are we really going to...?
- No.

10:56.305 --> 10:57.704
Get more evidence.

11:06.649 --> 11:09.083
Just a few more centimeters.

11:10.519 --> 11:12.510
You know, Walter,
working with you...

11:12.688 --> 11:15.156
...it's amazing
the sort of things you get used to.

11:15.324 --> 11:18.054
- You're not the first person to tell me that.
- Wow.

11:18.227 --> 11:20.923
Looks like somebody
could have flossed more.

11:27.436 --> 11:31.998
Okay. Let's just hope
that she has her dental records on file.

11:32.174 --> 11:33.937
File? Of course.

11:34.110 --> 11:38.012
My filing system.
Perhaps that's where I hid the manifesto.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.740
Like how you seal things
in the walls of your house?

11:40.916 --> 11:44.181
Or how you squirrel things
in deposit boxes around the country?

11:44.353 --> 11:45.877
I would hardly call that filing.

11:46.055 --> 11:48.922
I was trying to hide things
because I was afraid someone...

11:49.091 --> 11:51.252
...would unlock all my secrets.

11:51.427 --> 11:53.793
I didn't realize
that the someone would be me.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.954
Where's my Geiger counter?
I left it here.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.862
A radiation detector
is gonna help find the manifesto?

11:59.034 --> 12:04.939
No, but I find that the rhythmic
ticking it emits helps me think.

12:05.107 --> 12:09.373
Oh, Walter, Peter actually cannibalized
that for his project too.

12:09.545 --> 12:12.878
Oh, no. Look, this has got to stop.
Lab rule number one:

12:14.250 --> 12:16.548
Do not borrow Walter's equipment
without asking.

12:16.719 --> 12:22.521
- Walter. We found a match on the victim.
- Oh?

12:24.794 --> 12:27.092
Her name is Susan Pratt.

12:33.469 --> 12:36.302
Thank you. We'll take it from here.

12:36.672 --> 12:39.903
Susan Pratt. She's 29 years old.

12:40.075 --> 12:44.944
Single, worked for New York
Highway Department.

12:45.114 --> 12:46.911
Toll-booth operator.

12:47.082 --> 12:49.448
That's a lonely line of work.

12:53.255 --> 12:56.952
Doesn't look like
she had much of a social life either.

12:58.494 --> 13:00.519
She's definitely a table for one.

13:07.102 --> 13:10.196
Hey, Liv. Do you think there was
something wrong with her?

13:10.706 --> 13:13.334
- What do you mean?
- You know.

13:13.509 --> 13:16.000
Good-looking woman
in the prime of her life...

13:16.178 --> 13:20.137
...no evidence of a boyfriend,
or any friends, for that matter.

13:20.316 --> 13:22.784
Just doesn't exactly strike me
as being normal.

13:22.952 --> 13:26.513
Well, I guess that depends
on what your definition of normal is.

13:32.294 --> 13:33.693
Liv.

13:33.863 --> 13:35.558
Charlie, I think I found something.

13:35.731 --> 13:39.167
She has a $30,000 check
from an Isaac Winters.

13:39.335 --> 13:42.668
I found something too.
I think you should take a look at this.

13:56.886 --> 13:59.480
What the hell happened to her?

14:02.024 --> 14:03.855
Walter, I'm back.

14:04.026 --> 14:07.086
- Did you get it?
- No, I told you, they don't have it.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.096
It has to be Frankenberry,
that's what I ate back then.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.700
If I'm to remember
where I hid the manuscript...

14:12.868 --> 14:14.768
...it's simple sense memory, Peter.

14:14.970 --> 14:17.700
They don't have it.
For all we know, they don't make it.

14:17.873 --> 14:20.000
I did, however, get you this.

14:20.175 --> 14:23.372
All the artificial sugary sweetness
a growing scientist needs.

14:24.079 --> 14:25.944
Hello, Agent Dunham.

14:26.115 --> 14:31.610
Let me guess.
You're a cornflakes gal. Am I correct?

14:31.921 --> 14:33.582
Yeah, why not?

14:33.756 --> 14:35.519
We went to the victim's apartment...

14:35.691 --> 14:39.218
...and there appears to be evidence
of other fires.

14:40.262 --> 14:42.253
So the bus stop
wasn't her first incident?

14:42.431 --> 14:43.864
No.

14:44.567 --> 14:48.230
Walter, does that mean something
to you?

14:48.404 --> 14:50.702
Well, it changes everything.

14:50.873 --> 14:54.070
We can rule out spontaneous
human combustion, for one.

14:54.243 --> 14:57.110
I mean, that's strictly a one-off event,
as you can imagine.

14:57.947 --> 14:59.505
So what does it rule in?

15:01.450 --> 15:02.542
Pyrokinesis.

15:02.718 --> 15:05.448
- Stop. This is no time for jokes, Walter.
- Pyrokinesis?

15:05.621 --> 15:08.112
It's not even a real word.
Made up by Stephen King.

15:08.290 --> 15:11.657
Ever see Firestarter? Little girl
who can start fires with her mind?

15:11.827 --> 15:15.991
Mr. King coined the term, but the
phenomenon existed long before that.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.427
It's not that complicated.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.559
It's merely a form of telekinesis, the
ability to move objects with the mind.

15:21.737 --> 15:24.228
- "Merely."
- However, with pyrokinetics...

15:24.406 --> 15:27.273
...they can excite objects
at a molecular level.

15:28.410 --> 15:35.680
Well... Well, look. Think of each
of these grains of cereal as molecules.

15:36.485 --> 15:42.185
As the molecules
start to vibrate more quickly...

15:42.358 --> 15:46.351
...they generate heat energy...

15:46.562 --> 15:49.793
...until that energy must be released.

15:51.266 --> 15:52.494
Fascinating, Walter...

15:52.668 --> 15:55.432
...but it still doesn't explain
why Susan Pratt blew up.

15:55.604 --> 15:57.435
I suspect this was a newfound ability.

15:57.606 --> 16:01.372
It takes training to generate
a heat source outside of the body.

16:01.577 --> 16:04.045
Without proper control,
the energy is turned inward.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.044
You see? She had no other options.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.843
So you think that she had a choice...

16:09.018 --> 16:11.612
...to either blow somebody else up
or blow herself up?

16:11.787 --> 16:15.120
Yes. But this poor woman
had yet to master her ability.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.155
Which made her a powder keg.

16:17.326 --> 16:21.854
Emotional stress, agitation,
any high anxiety, would set her off.

16:22.031 --> 16:25.728
So where does this ability come from?
Is it that she was just born different?

16:25.901 --> 16:27.960
Or is it something
that someone did to her?

16:28.804 --> 16:32.331
That is the real question now, isn't it?

16:33.676 --> 16:36.509
- I'm not cleaning that up, by the way.
- Dunham.

16:36.679 --> 16:39.807
We got a hit from that check
you found in Susan Pratt's apartment.

16:39.982 --> 16:43.975
It was cut from a law firm,
signed by Isaac Winters.

16:44.153 --> 16:45.984
He has an office in Charlestown.

17:18.053 --> 17:19.384
No movement.

17:20.756 --> 17:23.054
Why am I not surprised
you brought one of those?

17:23.224 --> 17:25.125
Because you know me too well.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.922
If we get caught,
I don't know you at all.

17:42.911 --> 17:44.776
Looks like somebody left in a hurry.

17:44.947 --> 17:48.405
You have four new messages.

17:51.954 --> 17:54.479
Mr. Winters, this is Susan.
Susan Pratt.

17:54.690 --> 17:57.591
You told me to call you
if anything odd started happening.

17:57.760 --> 18:02.493
Well, it did, after I took the tests.
Please call me back.

18:04.066 --> 18:07.832
I'm gonna call ERT,
have them dust for prints.

18:08.937 --> 18:10.598
Mr. Winters, it's Susan again.

18:10.773 --> 18:14.641
You told me not to talk to anybody,
but I'm scared.

18:14.810 --> 18:16.778
What's happening to me?

18:31.994 --> 18:36.829
Attention, all citizens.
Evacuate the area now.

18:39.301 --> 18:41.269
This is not a test.

18:41.436 --> 18:43.233
Hey. Liv.

18:48.744 --> 18:50.473
You okay?

18:59.288 --> 19:01.313
You sure you haven't had any LSD?

19:02.224 --> 19:04.624
Mescaline? Magic mushrooms?

19:04.793 --> 19:06.488
It wasn't a drug trip, Walter.

19:06.695 --> 19:09.596
Well, hallucinations can be caused
by a number of things.

19:09.765 --> 19:11.596
Could you look straight ahead, please?

19:11.767 --> 19:15.225
Sleep deprivation, concussion,
brain tumor.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.235
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.969
Oh, I don't think so.

19:20.142 --> 19:25.011
If you were actually going insane, you'd
likely have no idea it was happening.

19:25.214 --> 19:27.239
Take it from me.

19:27.983 --> 19:30.474
When did these episodes start?
How did they feel?

19:30.652 --> 19:32.119
First was Susan Pratt's body.

19:32.287 --> 19:35.745
Then it was in Broyles' office,
the other, on the street.

19:35.924 --> 19:39.826
The same people, the same places,
but bleak.

19:39.995 --> 19:43.294
I mean, the city was on fire.

19:43.866 --> 19:49.168
Fascinating. There's another possibility,
but it's a bit complicated.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.629
Deja vu.

19:50.806 --> 19:52.797
It wasn't deja vu, Walter.
Not even close.

19:52.975 --> 19:56.502
Not typical.
Protracted deja vu, prolonged.

19:56.678 --> 20:00.478
You're familiar with
the pliability of space-time, yes?

20:00.649 --> 20:02.640
Of course. Who isn't?

20:02.818 --> 20:05.150
Wait, let me explain.

20:09.358 --> 20:15.888
Most of us experience life
as a linear progression, yes? Like this.

20:16.064 --> 20:20.797
This is an illusion, because every day,
life presents us with an array of choices.

20:20.969 --> 20:25.872
As a result,
life should look more like this:

20:26.408 --> 20:31.072
And each choice leads to a new path.

20:31.380 --> 20:35.749
To go to work, to stay home.

20:35.918 --> 20:41.515
And each choice we take
creates a new reality.

20:41.690 --> 20:42.748
Do you understand?

20:42.925 --> 20:45.416
Yes, but what does it have to do
with deja vu?

20:45.594 --> 20:49.428
Deja vu is simply a momentary glimpse
to the other side.

20:49.598 --> 20:51.361
Almost everyone experiences it.

20:51.533 --> 20:54.730
We feel that we've
been somewhere before...

20:54.903 --> 20:58.566
...because, actually,
we have in another reality.

20:59.741 --> 21:01.299
It's another path.

21:02.077 --> 21:03.840
The road not taken.

21:04.546 --> 21:05.877
Walter, why me?

21:06.815 --> 21:09.045
Why am I seeing these visions?

21:10.419 --> 21:11.681
I don't know.

21:18.527 --> 21:22.520
Walter, what about
William Bell's drug trials?

21:22.698 --> 21:24.689
Cortexiphan?

21:25.267 --> 21:27.599
- You said that it worked on perception.
- Yes.

21:27.769 --> 21:32.468
If it's true, and I was part
of the trials when I was a kid...

21:32.841 --> 21:35.401
...is it possible
that it's causing these visions?

21:35.911 --> 21:37.879
I don't know.

21:38.046 --> 21:42.107
But what I do know
is that you are a committed investigator.

21:42.284 --> 21:44.115
You're a perceptive agent.

21:44.286 --> 21:48.279
If you are having these visions, whatever
they are, there must be a reason.

21:48.457 --> 21:50.288
- Trust me.
- Really, Walter?

21:50.459 --> 21:54.793
From a man who routinely sees little
green men prancing through the lab?

21:54.963 --> 21:57.796
Hey, I think I found something.

21:57.966 --> 22:01.402
It's another victim who died
the same way Susan Pratt did.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.937
I checked it out and the guy
who runs the website lives in Malden.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.177
- Yes?
- My name is Olivia Dunham.

22:14.383 --> 22:16.408
I'm a special agent with the FBI.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.348
We need to speak
to Emmanuel Grayson.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.454
May I see your credentials, please?

22:35.337 --> 22:38.170
Mr. Grayson, you operate
a website called Galaxy Truths.

22:38.807 --> 22:42.971
Where you claim to uncover conspiracies
perpetrated by foreign governments.

22:43.145 --> 22:47.639
I don't claim. I accomplish.
Unlike you two.

22:48.150 --> 22:51.779
You're just pawns being used by the
government to spread their propaganda.

22:51.953 --> 22:54.319
Look, I can appreciate your opinion,
Mr. Grayson...

22:54.489 --> 22:56.480
No, look, look, you're right. Okay?

22:56.658 --> 22:58.057
She's a fed, but I'm not.

22:58.226 --> 23:01.024
I'm just like you.
I am a citizen in search of the truth.

23:01.196 --> 23:04.393
Give me the photo. We downloaded
this off of your website.

23:04.566 --> 23:07.797
It claims this person was a victim
of spontaneous human combustion.

23:07.969 --> 23:10.631
Now, you gotta tell us,
where did this one happen?

23:10.806 --> 23:13.070
Budapest. Three weeks ago.

23:13.241 --> 23:15.835
Victim was an American
graduate student on holiday.

23:16.011 --> 23:19.538
The Hungarian police
say he was attacked and set on fire.

23:19.714 --> 23:21.944
- That's not the truth.
- Why do you say that?

23:22.684 --> 23:24.811
Are you familiar with William Bell?

23:26.154 --> 23:28.088
Of course.

23:28.256 --> 23:30.224
William Bell killed these people.

23:31.460 --> 23:32.484
What do you mean?

23:32.661 --> 23:36.222
William Bell's company,
Massive Dynamic, is a cover.

23:36.398 --> 23:38.730
For all manner of unethical behavior.

23:39.201 --> 23:42.898
Multinational, outside the purview
of government control.

23:43.071 --> 23:46.939
He founded it to continue
his experiments with impunity.

23:47.109 --> 23:49.600
Among them, secret drug trials.

23:50.278 --> 23:53.008
This was one of his test subjects.

23:53.582 --> 23:55.675
Then why would William Bell
have him killed?

23:55.851 --> 23:58.718
Well, he didn't.
At least not intentionally.

23:58.887 --> 24:01.447
You see, Bell is trying
to activate his subjects.

24:01.623 --> 24:03.386
To see which ones were successful.

24:03.558 --> 24:07.016
Some can handle the process,
others can't.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.287
What process?

24:08.497 --> 24:11.227
- To create super-soldiers.
- Super-soldiers?

24:11.399 --> 24:14.766
Yes. Like Khan Noonien Singh.

24:14.936 --> 24:16.870
To defend us in the coming war.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.563
- What war?
- I'm sorry.

24:19.741 --> 24:21.572
- The Khan?
- Yes.

24:21.743 --> 24:22.869
As in The Wrath of?

24:23.612 --> 24:26.046
- Yes.
- And let me guess.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.546
This war, it's against?

24:28.717 --> 24:31.914
The Romulans. Renegade Romulans.
From the future.

24:32.087 --> 24:35.750
Here to change the timeline.
The sworn enemy of the Federation.

24:35.924 --> 24:39.155
The Federation? That would be
the United Federation of Planets?

24:39.327 --> 24:41.124
Yes.

24:41.830 --> 24:45.425
- And you all know this because?
- I am the son of Sarek.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.125
- Which makes you Spock.
- Yes.

24:49.404 --> 24:53.101
Well, Mr. Spock,
thank you for your time.

24:53.275 --> 24:55.266
We'll let you
get back to the bridge now.

24:55.810 --> 24:58.472
Live long and prosper.

24:58.647 --> 25:00.945
Okay, yes, you were right.

25:01.116 --> 25:04.244
But see that? I'm a big enough girl
to admit when I'm wrong.

25:04.419 --> 25:06.785
Oh, I think we can prepare
for that possibility...

25:06.955 --> 25:08.513
...it shouldn't be a problem.

25:08.690 --> 25:10.783
Mr. Prime Minister, I'm very sorry...

25:10.959 --> 25:13.689
...would you mind holding
for just a moment? Thanks.

25:14.663 --> 25:16.187
Hello?

25:16.798 --> 25:18.459
When?

25:19.935 --> 25:25.066
Well, no. Don't do that.
Don't do anything until I get there.

25:27.642 --> 25:30.611
Sir, I'm sorry, something has come up,
if you'll excuse me.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.339
Yes, you too.

25:34.216 --> 25:35.979
Get me to the helicopter, fast.

25:47.929 --> 25:50.591
What if we're overlooking something?

25:51.366 --> 25:54.199
What if Emmanuel Grayson was right?

25:54.636 --> 25:57.935
About which part?
Being from planet Vulcan?

25:58.106 --> 26:00.768
No. Forget that.

26:01.509 --> 26:03.033
Some of what he said made sense.

26:03.211 --> 26:04.542
We know that William Bell...

26:04.713 --> 26:07.978
...conducted drug trials
with experimental drugs.

26:08.183 --> 26:10.845
Cortexiphan, for one.

26:12.020 --> 26:14.511
Do you have anything stronger
for my coffee?

26:14.689 --> 26:18.216
Yeah, bottom drawer.
In the cabinet behind you.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.524
And here I was, halfway kidding.

26:26.601 --> 26:28.694
- What?
- What your father said...

26:28.870 --> 26:32.033
...about me having these visions
for a reason.

26:32.207 --> 26:34.471
Maybe there's a clue in them
I'm meant to find.

26:34.643 --> 26:36.907
- Meaning what?
- We have one victim, Susan Pratt.

26:37.112 --> 26:39.808
But in my visions,
there are always two bodies.

26:40.348 --> 26:43.146
- Who are they?
- I don't know. Unidentified.

26:43.318 --> 26:45.809
But if I could get back
to that parallel universe...

26:45.987 --> 26:48.888
...as Walter describes,
I can ID that second charred body.

26:49.057 --> 26:51.423
What's happening there
could help us understand...

26:51.626 --> 26:54.026
...what's happening here.
- Happening where?

26:54.896 --> 26:56.659
Nowhere.

27:00.669 --> 27:02.500
Here's your new assignment.

27:02.937 --> 27:04.734
Always a pleasure seeing you, sir.

27:17.786 --> 27:19.253
Hey.

27:19.421 --> 27:22.584
Wait a sec. Harris, can you stop?

27:22.757 --> 27:24.725
You want me to submit
for a psych exam?

27:24.893 --> 27:27.589
- That's right. I'm concerned for you.
- Why?

27:27.762 --> 27:31.129
I've read your briefs. I'd say
your analysis borders on the paranoid.

27:31.299 --> 27:34.234
Besides which,
your behavior's been noted as erratic...

27:34.402 --> 27:37.030
...and driven by emotion,
and not just by me.

27:37.205 --> 27:38.365
That's not what this is.

27:38.540 --> 27:40.770
My colleagues need to trust me,
depend on me...

27:40.942 --> 27:42.432
...not wonder in their minds...

27:42.610 --> 27:45.078
...whether I'm losing mine.
- This job is intense...

27:45.246 --> 27:47.373
This has got nothing to do
with my ability.

27:47.549 --> 27:51.451
- This is about you and me.
- Right now, you are acting emotionally.

27:51.619 --> 27:54.554
Yes, you're right, I am.
I've tried to move past our history.

27:54.723 --> 27:58.090
I've tried to reason with you
in interest of a working relationship.

27:58.259 --> 28:00.159
But you seem to get off on this.

28:00.328 --> 28:02.558
So fine, I don't give a damn anymore.

28:02.731 --> 28:05.598
I am not gonna let you
undermine my ability to do my job.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.928
You can color this
anyway you like, Dunham...

28:08.103 --> 28:11.903
...but I am still your superior officer.
That evaluation is a direct order.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.020
You put a shoot-to-kill order
out on the perps.

29:01.189 --> 29:03.487
You understand me?
Don't get close to them.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.126
- Charlie.
- Yeah, what's up?

29:07.162 --> 29:09.722
I was wondering where we were
on the Susan Pratt case.

29:09.898 --> 29:11.331
Pratt, nowhere.

29:11.499 --> 29:14.866
- Same place we were yesterday.
- I'd like to look again.

29:17.138 --> 29:20.198
You have half of Boston
in quarantined lockdown...

29:20.375 --> 29:22.866
...and you're worried about
a pair of charred twins?

29:23.344 --> 29:24.538
Twins?

29:38.660 --> 29:40.890
Sorry, didn't see you.

29:51.739 --> 29:54.606
We already ran Susan's bio,
where we didn't find a sister.

29:54.809 --> 29:56.242
I know.

29:56.411 --> 29:58.902
- Now, what makes you think...?
- Look. You were right.

29:59.080 --> 30:02.015
Nancy Lewis.
It says here that she had a twin sister...

30:02.183 --> 30:05.050
...who went missing 11 years ago.

30:05.220 --> 30:08.280
Maybe Susan ran away,
changed her identity.

30:08.456 --> 30:11.755
Well, she must have been running
pretty hard. Where does Nancy live?

30:14.229 --> 30:17.562
She's local, 934 Whittier.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.131
Thanks, Charlie.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.642
Hi. Can I help you?

30:35.483 --> 30:39.214
Nancy Lewis,
my name is Isaac Winters.

30:55.870 --> 31:00.204
Nancy Lewis? FBI.
We need to ask you some questions.

31:00.375 --> 31:02.206
It's unlocked.

31:15.590 --> 31:17.490
Nancy?

31:25.300 --> 31:27.359
Coffee's still hot.

31:31.339 --> 31:33.864
This is Dunham.
I need immediate forensic dispatch...

31:34.042 --> 31:38.103
...to 934 Whittier, apartment 210.

31:39.514 --> 31:42.278
Dunham, take a look at this.

31:42.450 --> 31:44.918
This glass has been melted.

31:46.354 --> 31:49.187
You think she's starting fires
like her sister?

31:49.724 --> 31:51.453
What is it?

31:52.594 --> 31:54.027
I got an idea.

31:58.533 --> 31:59.932
I'm not sure.

32:00.101 --> 32:01.830
I got it.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.532
Don't touch that.

32:06.708 --> 32:09.370
- We haven't pulled prints.
- You're not gonna need to.

32:09.544 --> 32:11.739
Protocols and processing
evidence are clear.

32:11.913 --> 32:14.108
Let me guess,
you're new around here.

32:14.282 --> 32:17.251
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

32:17.418 --> 32:20.080
Just tell Mr. Protocol
to let me do my job, please.

32:20.254 --> 32:21.915
It's okay, he's with me.

32:22.090 --> 32:25.491
Are you ever gonna tell me
what it is that you are actually doing?

32:25.660 --> 32:28.754
Help me with this first.
Hold the glass up here.

32:31.099 --> 32:32.589
Gently.

32:38.072 --> 32:40.063
I sure hope this is important.

32:40.241 --> 32:43.301
I was about to take my bath.

32:44.245 --> 32:46.645
Hey. You have any problem
taking it apart?

32:46.814 --> 32:49.305
Walter tried to take back
the electron microscope...

32:49.484 --> 32:51.850
...but I convinced him
that you needed it.

32:52.020 --> 32:53.248
So, what's going on?

32:53.421 --> 32:56.822
Nancy Lewis was kidnapped,
and we're gonna find out who did it.

33:09.203 --> 33:11.194
I've seen this woman before.

33:12.140 --> 33:13.869
Why does she look so familiar?

33:14.042 --> 33:17.136
Maybe because you dissected
her twin sister yesterday.

33:18.012 --> 33:22.540
Remember? Blond girl, about 5'7",
really well done, melted fillings?

33:22.784 --> 33:24.479
Oh, right.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.954
Astrid, can you plug that in
to the DVI input?

33:28.122 --> 33:29.919
Yes.

33:30.658 --> 33:32.125
Okay.

33:32.293 --> 33:35.888
Here's the deal. Walter, the project
that I've been working on...

33:36.064 --> 33:37.725
...was for you.
- For me?

33:37.932 --> 33:39.297
It reconstructs audio.

33:39.467 --> 33:42.834
I wanted you to be able to digitize
some old records you have.

33:43.004 --> 33:45.837
- I know how much they mean to you.
- Thank you, son.

33:47.709 --> 33:54.706
You know, when he was 5,
he built me a popsicle napkin holder.

33:54.882 --> 33:59.410
- Dreadful design. Utterly useless.
- Thank you.

33:59.587 --> 34:03.887
But this... This is... Ha.

34:04.592 --> 34:06.560
You're welcome. Anyway...

34:06.728 --> 34:09.356
...the basic principles at work here
are very simple.

34:09.530 --> 34:12.726
- You know how a record player works?
- Needle goes over the grooves.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.266
Vibrations it picks up
are amplified into sound.

34:15.469 --> 34:18.530
Exactly. The principle's the same,
except instead of a needle...

34:18.706 --> 34:21.869
...I use the microscope
to take a high-resolution digital image...

34:22.043 --> 34:23.670
...of the grooves on the surface.

34:23.844 --> 34:27.178
That is transferred to the computer,
which translates it into audio...

34:27.348 --> 34:30.408
...that we can hear.
- You sound just like him.

34:31.552 --> 34:34.543
I'm guessing that with the
software modifications I gave you...

34:34.722 --> 34:36.917
...we're gonna do the same thing
with this.

34:37.091 --> 34:39.719
You're saying that you can play back
the glass somehow.

34:39.893 --> 34:42.192
Yeah. Walter says
these pyrotechnic abilities...

34:42.362 --> 34:44.592
...only occur
during times of emotional stress.

34:44.766 --> 34:46.791
I think that when our twin
was kidnapped...

34:47.001 --> 34:50.300
...the heat that she generated
caused that window to liquefy slightly.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.201
Which means that any sound
that was in this room...

34:53.373 --> 34:56.036
...would have left
microscopic impressions in the glass.

34:56.210 --> 34:57.609
Like the grooves on a record.

34:58.246 --> 35:01.511
Exactly right.
Now, if you'll please scan the glass.

35:04.652 --> 35:08.713
- Okay, you're ready to go.
- All right.

35:08.890 --> 35:12.121
It's transferring
into the sound processor now.

35:12.293 --> 35:13.624
Let's see what we got.

35:17.799 --> 35:19.630
That could have been
one of my records.

35:20.635 --> 35:23.604
It's okay. I already have
a digital scan of the glass.

35:23.771 --> 35:25.898
Let's try that again. Shall we?

35:26.774 --> 35:29.072
Just slow it down.

35:37.852 --> 35:40.446
I don't understand,
this should be working.

35:43.658 --> 35:45.091
Yes. Yes.

35:47.295 --> 35:49.661
Now, attenuate for ambient noise.

35:54.969 --> 35:56.994
Get out of here.

35:57.171 --> 35:59.366
Stay away.

35:59.607 --> 36:01.074
What do you want?

36:04.779 --> 36:06.576
Please.

36:09.383 --> 36:11.283
I have her, see you there.

36:12.620 --> 36:13.712
The poor dear.

36:17.325 --> 36:19.793
Peter, can you play it
from when he starts to talk?

36:19.961 --> 36:22.293
Yeah, one sec.

36:24.966 --> 36:27.298
Okay, just there, where's he's dialing.

36:28.202 --> 36:30.136
Okay, can you make that clearer?

36:30.338 --> 36:34.035
Sure. Now, we just isolate the sound.

36:39.547 --> 36:41.139
You thinking what I'm thinking?

36:41.315 --> 36:43.943
My cell phone app
can dial the number from the tones.

36:57.198 --> 36:58.756
This is Harris.

37:07.742 --> 37:10.233
I'm headed out for a few hours.
Anybody needs me...

37:10.411 --> 37:13.505
...I'm reachable by cell phone.
- You got it.

37:28.529 --> 37:31.191
I got him, Charlie. He's headed west.

37:31.365 --> 37:33.265
I'm right behind you.

38:12.073 --> 38:14.473
Charlie, he's approaching a warehouse...

38:14.642 --> 38:16.234
...off Moore and Adams.

38:17.545 --> 38:20.207
Roger that.
We're turning on to Adams right now.

38:39.700 --> 38:40.724
Hey.

38:40.901 --> 38:45.395
- He used a remote to get in.
- I guess we'll go the old-fashioned way.

39:08.029 --> 39:10.623
- Where are we?
- No thermal activity yet.

39:10.798 --> 39:13.460
The body temperature's normal.
We'll know more soon.

39:13.634 --> 39:17.331
Well, he's losing patience.
We need her active. Get it done.

40:03.184 --> 40:08.053
- Liv, I heard gunshots. You okay?
- Charlie, we've got a man down.

40:20.367 --> 40:23.495
Charlie, I've got her.
Back north-west corner.

40:25.539 --> 40:27.871
- I'm Olivia, I am with the FBI.
- Help me, please.

40:28.042 --> 40:30.408
Don't worry. You're gonna be okay.

40:30.578 --> 40:31.738
No!

40:32.913 --> 40:34.574
Harris, open the door!

40:36.050 --> 40:38.280
Goddamn it, Harris, open the door.

40:38.452 --> 40:40.181
Open the door.

40:42.623 --> 40:44.022
I can't breathe.

40:45.126 --> 40:46.923
Well, look at that.

40:49.730 --> 40:53.188
Good work, Dunham. You managed
to activate her before we could.

40:53.367 --> 40:55.733
Damn it, Harris, open the door.
She needs help.

40:55.903 --> 40:59.430
Not if she can control it.
If not, she'll explode and kill both of you.

40:59.607 --> 41:01.234
So one problems solves another.

41:03.043 --> 41:04.874
- I'm burning up.
- You're gonna be okay.

41:05.045 --> 41:07.377
- Just calm down. Just calm down.
- I'm burning up.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.914
- Okay.
- Yeah, it's me. I need to speak to him.

41:10.084 --> 41:12.052
Hold on,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

41:12.219 --> 41:13.618
It worked. She's hot.

41:13.787 --> 41:15.550
We have an active, but she's a loss.

41:15.723 --> 41:18.214
- She's highly unstable.
- Why is this happening to me?

41:18.392 --> 41:22.158
They did something to you, maybe
to both of us, when we were just kids.

41:22.363 --> 41:24.388
Now you're feeling the effects
from that.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.624
You can control this, okay?

41:26.800 --> 41:28.768
You can control this,
I'm gonna help you.

41:28.936 --> 41:31.803
I just need you to focus the heat
away from us.

41:31.972 --> 41:33.906
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Just focus.

41:34.074 --> 41:38.067
Focus on anything. Focus, Nancy.
You can do this, Nancy.

41:38.779 --> 41:40.747
- I can't.
- You can.

41:40.915 --> 41:44.282
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
There won't even be a trace.

41:44.451 --> 41:45.884
I...

42:04.505 --> 42:07.338
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

42:07.508 --> 42:09.874
Oh, yeah, you're gonna be okay.

42:12.546 --> 42:15.447
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

42:23.224 --> 42:25.556
Okay, I think you got
all of that, Walter.

42:25.726 --> 42:28.286
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

42:28.462 --> 42:30.453
Excuse me,
could you keep an eye on him...

42:30.631 --> 42:32.292
...make sure he doesn't leave?

42:38.372 --> 42:40.306
Agent Dunham.

42:40.741 --> 42:42.709
Where's Peter?

42:42.876 --> 42:45.504
Peter's in the bathroom.

42:49.350 --> 42:51.318
What the hell did you people do to us?

43:02.329 --> 43:04.058
You and William Bell, Walter.

43:05.532 --> 43:07.557
What did you do to me?

43:10.337 --> 43:12.237
Susan Pratt...

43:13.040 --> 43:17.340
...and Nancy Lewis
are from Jacksonville, Florida.

43:17.678 --> 43:19.908
Just like Nick Lane.

43:20.080 --> 43:23.675
A guy that you conducted drug trials on
when he was a kid.

43:23.851 --> 43:26.615
The drug trials
that you conducted on me.

43:28.589 --> 43:30.420
They were Belly's.

43:30.591 --> 43:31.888
They were his trials.

43:32.059 --> 43:34.186
But you knew.

43:35.296 --> 43:37.958
Walter, you were there.
And you knew.

43:38.132 --> 43:40.532
We were trying to help.

43:40.901 --> 43:42.766
- We meant no harm.
- No harm?

43:42.936 --> 43:48.374
You were drugging children.
Three-year-old children, Walter.

43:48.542 --> 43:50.305
Why did you do it?

43:51.045 --> 43:53.946
We were trying to prepare you...

43:54.248 --> 43:56.773
...to make you capable.

43:57.318 --> 43:58.808
Able.

44:01.655 --> 44:04.749
- Something terrible is coming.
- What?

44:05.526 --> 44:07.426
I don't know.

44:08.028 --> 44:10.258
Walter, what did you do to us?

44:10.431 --> 44:12.023
I don't know.

44:12.232 --> 44:15.895
- Damn it, Walter, you do.
- No. I don't.

44:16.837 --> 44:18.896
I don't know.

44:19.073 --> 44:22.839
I can't remember.

44:28.349 --> 44:30.579
I'm sorry.

44:59.113 --> 45:00.580
Hey.

45:01.181 --> 45:03.649
Hey, Walter.

45:05.018 --> 45:07.213
What just happened?

45:57.671 --> 45:59.002
Nina.

45:59.173 --> 46:00.504
What is it?

46:00.674 --> 46:02.699
These were all taken
in the last 24 hours.

46:03.343 --> 46:06.278
You know what happened
the last time he appeared...

46:06.447 --> 46:08.176
...with this kind of frequency.

46:09.716 --> 46:11.707
We need to talk.

47:26.126 --> 47:27.320
Astrid, I found it.

47:27.861 --> 47:31.854
The original manuscript
with the extra pages.

47:32.032 --> 47:33.431
I was right.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.465
Listen to this:

47:36.003 --> 47:39.495
"Our children
are our greatest resource.

47:39.673 --> 47:43.165
We must nurture them,
and protect them.

47:43.644 --> 47:48.672
We must prepare them
so they can one day protect us."

47:49.383 --> 47:50.782
You see, I was...

47:52.619 --> 47:53.847
Hello, Walter.

47:57.391 --> 47:58.949
Hello.

48:00.193 --> 48:02.354
It's time to go.

48:06.833 --> 48:08.630
Is it time?

48:22.916 --> 48:24.975
I'll get my coat.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.109
Evening.
