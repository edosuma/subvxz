It's true he's worth something,

00:17.800 --> 00:20.292
but he needs to show that
he still has the skill.

00:20.328 --> 00:22.358
- Can you make that happen?
- I can.

- Coffee in the pot, pastries on the table.

- It was a one-off.
- You don't want pastries?

03:39.924 --> 03:40.940
I didn't say that.

Mmm!

- That's good.
- I mean, this might be about Lowry.

04:02.652 --> 04:04.136
It's probably nothing, but...

04:04.335 --> 04:06.455

We're tracing police reports, keywords,

05:09.689 --> 05:12.075

youths in Mazyr stood out.

05:12.111 --> 05:12.788

as a white British woman

- What was the girl's name?
- Maya.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.708

05:39.336 --> 05:41.536
Omair would have been so proud of you.

05:43.685 --> 05:45.134

- 'Morally, of course, I object.'

Of course.

- No.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.202

07:08.073 --> 07:11.397
We moved here from Bosnia. Srebrenica.

07:11.433 --> 07:14.776
- You are aware of the troubles there, yes?
- Yes.

07:15.856 --> 07:17.700
So, the family are sent here

07:30.937 --> 07:36.051

anything that you can tell me

07:44.800 --> 07:46.304

07:48.346 --> 07:50.009

for a car that matches
the sister's description.

away. Fits the timescale.

- She's using the girl for an attack.
- It's a possibility.

08:14.935 --> 08:18.002
No, it's more than a possibility,
I understand how she works.

08:18.088 --> 08:20.586
She'll have gained her trust,
made her feel important.

was filled with harmless chemicals.

14:24.090 --> 14:25.041
Why?

14:25.077 --> 14:27.929
Because I do not shit on

But this was success.

14:30.346 --> 14:31.611
This was not a success.

be smuggled through Security,

15:08.097 --> 15:09.334
trying to find out if it was faulty

15:09.398 --> 15:11.634
or deliberately primed not to activate.

15:11.717 --> 15:14.132
Airport security cameras pulled
up something else, though.

Yuri Shevchenko, ex-member of
Scorpio, a notorious Serbian

15:19.120 --> 15:23.443

he was Borisovich's main enforcer.

15:23.498 --> 15:25.875
He was at the airport
watching. And this is good.

15:25.911 --> 15:27.017
Boss, I missed the good part.

15:27.053 --> 15:29.650
If Borisovich had a presence at
the airport for Lowry's attack,

15:29.701 --> 15:31.292
it's evidence they are
still working together.

15:31.328 --> 15:34.311

Ivan. Runs a pool hall.

15:34.381 --> 15:35.172

15:35.208 --> 15:37.365
Imagine so, the place is
called Ivan and Yuri's.

15:37.427 --> 15:39.031
Could have led with that, Will.

15:39.121 --> 15:41.245
The pool hall's a front
for low-level crime.

15:41.281 --> 15:43.651
Have words with the cousin,
try to find out where Yuri is.

15:43.687 --> 15:46.737
We locate Yuri, we work our
way back, we find Borisovich,

15:46.802 --> 15:48.417
find Jane before something else happens.

15:48.481 --> 15:52.500

rehearsal for something much worse.

15:52.984 --> 15:54.144
Copy that.

15:57.065 --> 16:01.589
So, ma'am, has anyone told Maya's sister?

16:01.625 --> 16:04.313
Anti-terrorist officers have
picked her up for questioning.

16:04.349 --> 16:06.064
Right, it's just I promised her sister...

16:06.135 --> 16:07.752
You promised her sister
whatever she needed to hear

16:07.788 --> 16:10.554
so you could get the intel,
exactly as I told you to do.

16:11.579 --> 16:14.002
This is only a win because
the device didn't activate.

16:14.088 --> 16:16.688
You want to feel bad about
something, feel bad about that.

16:16.786 --> 16:19.851

- Slainte.

16:35.335 --> 16:38.934
- You did the right thing, you know.
- Yeah.

16:39.011 --> 16:41.011
That's what we're up against these days.

16:41.864 --> 16:47.475
One person, a city centre, a
bomb, a car, truck, a knife...

16:48.652 --> 16:51.512
- She chose to do this.
- Yeah, and Lowry chose her.

16:52.665 --> 16:54.225
Give me more of that.

16:57.381 --> 17:01.145
Misguided, justified... It doesn't matter.

17:01.483 --> 17:04.089
The moment she went into a
civilian area to do harm to folk

17:04.166 --> 17:07.040
whose only crime was being in the
wrong place at the wrong time...

17:07.931 --> 17:08.955
No.

17:10.134 --> 17:13.412
- You don't have any doubts, do you?
- Not about this.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.252
So, what's worrying you?

17:19.342 --> 17:22.487
We'd all be on the scrapheap
if it wasn't for Donovan, right?

17:29.021 --> 17:32.911
I feel like she would burn through

- Jensen.

So they had Abbott and no Costello.

27:24.350 --> 27:27.154
- Which means Maya died for nothing.
- Not necessarily.

27:27.190 --> 27:29.655
They discovered a faint level
of radiation on the canister,

27:29.741 --> 27:32.215
which is strange in
itself. But it also means...

27:32.286 --> 27:33.490
We can trace where it came from.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.979
Yes, because each radiation
signature is distinct.

So, I've been working through
the ledger that Novin grabbed from

assets match this radiation source...

27:42.447 --> 27:45.234

evacuated, and never came back.

38:16.635 --> 38:18.679
(SHE CHOKES AND COUGHS)

38:19.848 --> 38:22.396
Hold on, yeah? You're going
to be OK. Just hold on.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.427
- Markov...
- I need a minute.

38:28.463 --> 38:29.554
She doesn't have a minute.

38:29.691 --> 38:32.852
If it's not properly
purified, it will kill her.

38:34.466 --> 38:36.506
- Shit!
- Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

38:36.549 --> 38:37.595
Did he finish it?

38:38.350 --> 38:41.110
(REYNOLDS GASPS)

38:43.241 --> 38:44.794
Mac, what are you doing?

38:45.188 --> 38:46.214
Mac?

38:50.757 --> 38:53.181
Wait! He said if it's not
purified, it'll kill her.

38:53.242 --> 38:54.477
She's dying anyway.

38:57.631 --> 38:58.831
Fuck.

39:11.430 --> 39:13.474
(SHE GASPS)

39:13.510 --> 39:16.750
(SHE COUGHS)

39:17.985 --> 39:20.128
It's OK. It's OK.

39:24.015 --> 39:26.214
She's OK. She's OK.

39:27.770 --> 39:30.194
Come on, let's blow this place
and get the hell out of here.

39:30.230 --> 39:32.805
You did it, you stopped it. You stopped it.

39:32.876 --> 39:33.847
We good? Let's go.

39:33.943 --> 39:35.343
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

39:48.173 --> 39:49.626
This will get the job done.

39:50.351 --> 39:51.351
Put you down.

39:55.351 --> 39:58.406
- Yep, that'll do it.
- It's set, let's move.

39:58.442 --> 40:01.319
Donovan said if we could
get a sample of the Novichok,

40:01.405 --> 40:03.354
the Ministry of Defence
would really like it.

40:03.390 --> 40:05.595
Of course, when the enemy
has it, it's terrorism.

40:05.658 --> 40:07.034
When we have it, it's just modern warfare.

40:07.070 --> 40:08.651
So, we following orders or what?

40:10.071 --> 40:11.937
REYNOLDS: Just blow the place to hell.

40:19.300 --> 40:20.300
Captain.

40:22.870 --> 40:25.557
- You sure about this?
- Do it.

40:25.596 --> 40:28.197
Wait, wait, wait. Can I do it?

40:28.248 --> 40:29.368
Sure, mate.

40:37.950 --> 40:39.030
Come on!

40:49.030 --> 40:51.074
Fucking 20, eh?

40:51.172 --> 40:53.102
Destroying more of my property.

40:53.870 --> 40:59.582
Even without Markov, the Novichok
can be reverse-engineered.

41:00.135 --> 41:01.315
Our agreement...

41:01.390 --> 41:03.922
You didn't really think I
would let that jihadist bitch,

41:03.983 --> 41:06.342
loose with chemical weapons, did you?

41:07.802 --> 41:09.322
Then what was all this for?

41:14.575 --> 41:20.763
The Russians developed Novichok,
but no paperwork, no samples,

41:20.799 --> 41:22.934
Markov had it all up here.

41:23.294 --> 41:27.269
I needed you to make sure
he completed his work.

41:27.714 --> 41:32.319
You were my good and faithful
servant, and I thank you.

41:35.728 --> 41:37.242
Stop! Stop!

41:47.186 --> 41:49.546
(GASPING)

42:16.830 --> 42:21.910
(SHE WHEEZES AND COUGHS)

42:29.845 --> 42:32.245
(SHE RETCHES)

42:44.743 --> 42:48.863
(PHONE RINGS)

43:03.032 --> 43:04.952
How did you get this number?

43:11.050 --> 43:11.901
Ma'am?

43:16.910 --> 43:19.834
I was monitoring comms within a
10 mile radius of the facility,

43:19.870 --> 43:21.914
going through all the
calls it picked up and...

43:21.950 --> 43:23.052
What?

43:32.539 --> 43:34.543
LOWRY: 'How did you get this number?'

43:35.847 --> 43:37.413
MAN: 'He gave it to me.

43:38.328 --> 43:39.794
'What do you mean?

43:39.881 --> 43:42.529
'Your husband. Omair Idrisi.

43:43.248 --> 43:45.034
'He's still alive.'
