WEBVTT

00:08.471 --> 00:09.008
Hi.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.743
Hi.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.111
Okay.

00:16.649 --> 00:18.416
So I thought we'd...
try this new restaurant.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.018
It's right around
the corner from here.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.686
It's Scottish-Mexican fusion.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.088
Scottish-Mexican fusion?

00:23.090 --> 00:24.689
Scottish-Mexican fusion.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.192
That would seem like two things
that do not fuse.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.793
Perhaps you'll change
your mind when you try

00:28.795 --> 00:30.362
their signature
haggis enchiladas.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.730
Okay.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.466
All right. Yeah, come on.
Lead the way.

00:34.468 --> 00:37.302
I was surprised
when you called.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.670
Isn't there some
universal guy rule

00:38.672 --> 00:41.239
where you have to wait
four days to call a girl?

00:41.241 --> 00:43.274
That... does not ring a bell.

00:43.276 --> 00:44.609
And it's three days.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.278
Here we are.

00:49.516 --> 00:52.117
Uh, I did not realize
there would be live music.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.452
So, uh, should we...

00:54.454 --> 00:55.620
Eat anywhere but here?

00:55.622 --> 00:57.288
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.957
Besides, I'm sure
we can find a place

00:58.959 --> 01:00.125
where we don't need
reservations.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.593
Oh, you think
it's just that easy?

01:01.595 --> 01:03.828
Just stroll in off the
street and get a meal?

01:03.830 --> 01:07.766
Well, let me tell you
the tale of Gary Blauman.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.300
There's the blushing bride!

01:09.302 --> 01:10.802
Oh!

01:10.804 --> 01:12.103
Gary Blauman!

01:12.105 --> 01:13.638
How are you?!

01:13.640 --> 01:15.573
Uh, duh, like I need to ask.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.875
You're getting married.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.177
Well, don't let me keep you.
You have things to do.

01:19.179 --> 01:21.913
I will see you
walking down the aisle.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.550
I'll be the guy in the
eighth row going like this.

01:26.085 --> 01:28.119
Right?!
Right.

01:28.121 --> 01:29.421
Good luck today!
Thank you.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.055
Okay.

01:31.891 --> 01:33.458
Hey, there's the
blushing bride...

01:33.460 --> 01:34.759
Code red!

Oh, my God. Oh, my God,

01:49.776 --> 01:51.209
oh, my God!
Why the code red?

01:51.211 --> 01:53.344
I mean, if it's...
if it's about your hair,

01:53.346 --> 01:55.447
I didn't even notice;
especially not from the back.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.649
What?
Nothing.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.684
Gary Blauman is here,
and I had no idea he was coming.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.419
His reply card must've
gotten lost in the mail.

02:01.421 --> 02:02.620
I mean,
where's he gonna sit?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.923
It took us weeks to plan
the seating chart!

02:04.925 --> 02:06.891
Robin.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.158
Shh.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.961
I got you.
Huh?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.897
You're talking to
the seating chart master.

02:12.899 --> 02:15.700
At my own wedding, I managed
to sit small-town Minnesotans

02:15.702 --> 02:19.604
right next to liberal New
Yorkers with grace <i>and</i> aplomb.

02:19.606 --> 02:22.707
Table 27 still gets together
once a year for a reunion.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.176
Perhaps you've seen their photos
on Facebook.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.580
Like I said...

02:28.582 --> 02:29.981
I got you.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.182
Thanks, Marshall.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.989
Code red!

02:37.991 --> 02:39.591
Grandma's sitting
next to the band,

02:39.593 --> 02:41.926
divorced couple sitting one
table away from each other,

02:41.928 --> 02:44.028
no coherent
singles table.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.331
This is the Robin's hair
of seating charts.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.333
Singles tables are cruel.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.900
I mean, what if you went
to a wedding

02:48.902 --> 02:50.502
and there was a table
of all fat guys?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.270
That would be awesome.
You're right, it would.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.771
Let's crack this
Gary Blauman nut first,

02:53.773 --> 02:55.673
and then we'll work
on the fat guy table.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.842
Wait, did you say Gary Blauman?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.744
Yeah. Why?

02:59.746 --> 03:03.214
I... hate... that guy.

03:03.216 --> 03:04.282
Why?

03:04.284 --> 03:05.583
Remember a few years ago

03:05.585 --> 03:07.585
when I read that biography
of Teddy Roosevelt?

03:07.587 --> 03:09.187
<i>For weeks after I read it,</i>

03:09.189 --> 03:12.323
<i>I only wanted to talk</i>
<i>about one thing.</i>

03:12.325 --> 03:15.560
Teddy Roosevelt was
the coolest guy ever!

03:16.730 --> 03:18.863
Oh, that's it!
No more books, Ted.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.533
I don't like the person
you become when you read books.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.701
Here's the deal: you
get to tell us one more

03:23.703 --> 03:26.004
interesting fact
about Teddy Roosevelt.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.473
One more, and then
you're done forever.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.941
So make it a good one.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.243
Okay.

03:32.245 --> 03:34.846
He went blind in one eye...

03:34.848 --> 03:37.615
from getting hit too hard
in a boxing match...

03:38.250 --> 03:40.151
...while he was president!

03:40.153 --> 03:41.419
That's a pretty good one.
Wow.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.487
That is kind of...

03:42.489 --> 03:43.988
Right?! Oh, and when he was
at Harvard...

03:43.990 --> 03:45.890
No! No! Shut up!
Oh, my God! Please!

03:45.892 --> 03:47.992
<i>Well, one night,</i>
<i>we were throwing a party</i>

03:47.994 --> 03:50.562
<i>to celebrate... something--</i>

03:50.564 --> 03:52.096
<i>I-I can't remember what--</i>

03:52.098 --> 03:54.065
<i>when a pretty girl</i>
<i>I had never met</i>

03:54.067 --> 03:55.733
<i>noticed the book</i>
<i>on the coffee table.</i>

03:55.735 --> 03:57.702
I can't believe
you have this book.

03:57.704 --> 03:58.903
I just finished
reading it.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.473
Teddy Roosevelt was
the coolest guy ever.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.509
A unicorn.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.743
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

04:05.745 --> 04:07.312
It was a stroke of luck on par

04:07.314 --> 04:09.781
<i>with the 50-page manuscript</i>
<i>in Roosevelt's breast pocket</i>

04:09.783 --> 04:12.083
<i>that helped slow that</i>
<i>would-be assassin's bullet.</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:12.917
Dude, come on.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.519
Sorry. Anyway...

04:14.521 --> 04:17.088
enter Gary Blauman.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.624
Is that the Teddy
Roosevelt biography?

04:19.625 --> 04:21.426
Coolest guy ever.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.661
Right? Right?

04:23.663 --> 04:25.196
Right? Right?

04:25.198 --> 04:27.999
Right? Right?
Right?

04:28.001 --> 04:30.435
<i>So the three of us started</i>
<i>talking Teddy Roosevelt.</i>

04:30.437 --> 04:32.370
When he took that
four-minute flight

04:32.372 --> 04:33.605
on the Wright
brother's plane?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.772
So cool.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.641
The time he climbed
the tallest mountain

04:36.643 --> 04:38.443
in Europe on
his honeymoon.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.644
So cool.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.212
<i>And that's when I realized,</i>

04:41.214 --> 04:43.314
<i>Blauman and I were locked</i>
<i>in a battle of wills</i>

04:43.316 --> 04:45.516
<i>that made T.R.'s charge</i>
<i>up San Juan Hill</i>

04:45.518 --> 04:47.018
<i>look like a walk in the park.</i>

04:47.020 --> 04:49.220
<i>Or should I say,</i>
<i>in the national park,</i>

04:49.222 --> 04:50.254
<i>since it was Roosevelt</i>

04:50.256 --> 04:51.756
<i>who spearheaded</i>
<i>the establishment...</i>

04:51.758 --> 04:53.758
Dude, come on. I gave you one.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.661
The battle raged on.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.630
In a way, he was...

04:58.632 --> 05:02.700
...the archetype
of the modern politician!

05:03.603 --> 05:05.203
<i>Dude, knock it off.</i>

05:05.205 --> 05:06.938
<i>Knock what off, bro?</i>

05:06.940 --> 05:08.039
<i>This is my apartment,</i>

05:08.041 --> 05:09.140
<i>my Teddy Roosevelt</i>
<i>conversation,</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:10.508
<i>I get the girl.</i>

05:10.510 --> 05:12.977
<i>Oh, so the fact that</i>
<i>you're the incumbent means</i>

05:12.979 --> 05:14.112
<i>she should just pick you?</i>

05:14.114 --> 05:16.147
<i>Tell that</i>
<i>to William Howard Taft.</i>

05:16.149 --> 05:18.716
<i>You're calling me Taft?</i>

05:18.718 --> 05:20.518
If anyone's Taft, you're Taft!

05:20.520 --> 05:22.387
<i>I'm not Taft! I'm Teddy!</i>

05:22.389 --> 05:24.422
<i>The hell you are.</i>
<i>My name is Ted!</i>

05:24.424 --> 05:27.659
<i>Yeah, right. Go sign the</i>
<i>Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act, Taft!</i>

05:27.661 --> 05:29.927
<i>How dare you?</i>

05:29.929 --> 05:32.797
Skinny-dipping
in the Potomac River.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.001
<i>And so the standoff</i>
<i>continued, hours passed...</i>

05:37.003 --> 05:39.170
<i>then days.</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:41.472
Days passed?
Days passed.

05:41.474 --> 05:44.876
<i>Finally, a T.R. stricken</i>
<i>by tropical fever</i>

05:44.878 --> 05:48.546
<i>on his Amazon trek,</i>
<i>we could go no further.</i>

05:48.548 --> 05:51.082
When he was Assistant Secretary
of the Navy...

05:51.084 --> 05:52.650
Will you just pick
one of us already

05:52.652 --> 05:54.719
so I can either have sex
or go to sleep!

05:56.655 --> 05:58.890
Smooth, bro.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.492
After that day,
I have never liked that guy.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.628
So let's just tell Robin
this can't be done,

06:03.630 --> 06:05.263
and send Gary Blauman packing.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.731
Did you just say

06:06.733 --> 06:08.332
Gary Blauman?

06:08.334 --> 06:09.233
Yeah.

06:09.235 --> 06:11.602
I...

06:11.604 --> 06:13.371
love that guy!

06:13.373 --> 06:14.839
What?! He's the devil!

06:14.841 --> 06:16.708
He's an angel.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.811
It was 2006,
Marshall and I had broken up,

06:19.813 --> 06:21.913
and I was back in New York
feeling vulnerable

06:21.915 --> 06:24.415
and listening to
my breakup song over and over.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.718
Sugar Ray's "Fly."
You know it.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.586
Man, you know nothing
about breakups.

06:28.588 --> 06:29.954
I really don't.

06:29.956 --> 06:32.523
Anyway, then I hit bottom.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.691
There's a bottom
below Sugar Ray?

06:33.693 --> 06:35.426
Mm.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.361
What?!

06:37.363 --> 06:39.397
Why have I never
seen that before?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.565
I've been using cover-up

06:40.567 --> 06:42.900
and strategically placed straps
for a long time

06:42.902 --> 06:44.769
to keep this puppy quiet.

06:44.771 --> 06:47.038
After all the times
you guys made fun of me

06:47.040 --> 06:48.539
for my breakup butterfly
tattoo?

06:50.577 --> 06:52.877
Oh, the fact that Ted got
a butterfly tattoo,

06:52.879 --> 06:55.079
will you ever stop
being hilarious?

06:55.081 --> 06:57.081
So why is it only
half a butterfly?

06:57.083 --> 07:00.485
Because Gary Blauman saw me
in the tattoo parlor,

07:00.487 --> 07:03.121
dragged me out
and talked some sense into me.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.889
Lily, trust me,

07:04.891 --> 07:07.024
you and Marshall
are going to get back together.

07:07.026 --> 07:10.094
And when you do, you will
be so glad you did not get

07:10.096 --> 07:11.763
the other half
of that butterfly.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.933
Actually, I was gonna get a
little more than the butterfly.

07:18.570 --> 07:21.105
It's good that I ran into you.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.374
Marshall, Blauman saved you
from a lifetime

07:23.376 --> 07:26.444
of looking at Sugar Ray every
time we do it on your birthday.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.945
Find him a nice seat.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.248
No, no, do not find him a seat.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.049
I'm telling you, this guy...
You find him a nice...

07:32.051 --> 07:33.484
<i>Neither of us</i>
<i>was gonna back down,</i>

07:33.486 --> 07:35.920
so finally we decided
to take it to the groom.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.856
Wh-What's going on?
Shh!

07:38.858 --> 07:40.024
Wha...?

07:42.961 --> 07:43.961
Who's that guy?

07:43.963 --> 07:46.130
It's my ex-boyfriend.

07:49.950 --> 07:51.450
So, we're crouching
behind a van,

07:51.452 --> 07:53.052
hiding from
your ex-boyfriend.

07:53.354 --> 07:56.088
Forgive me, I'm a little bit
of a detective.

07:56.090 --> 07:57.723
It was a bad breakup?

07:57.725 --> 07:59.091
Pretty bad.

07:59.093 --> 08:01.059
Bad like
there was a big fight?

08:01.061 --> 08:03.162
Bad like there was
a big ring.

08:03.164 --> 08:05.297
Bad like this happened
in the past year?

08:05.299 --> 08:08.367
Bad like it
happened Saturday.

08:08.369 --> 08:10.335
So bad.

08:10.337 --> 08:11.603
Yeah.

08:13.873 --> 08:15.674
Okay, he's gone.

08:16.843 --> 08:19.278
I'm so sorry, Ted.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.947
I really like you,
but I'm-I'm in

08:21.949 --> 08:24.816
the weirdest place on Earth
right now.

08:24.818 --> 08:26.518
You're in a Scottish-Mexican
restaurant?

08:27.655 --> 08:28.787
Yup.

08:28.789 --> 08:31.323
Yeah, I am.

08:32.225 --> 08:34.960
It's just too soon
for me to be dating.

08:34.962 --> 08:36.895
I think I should head home.

08:36.897 --> 08:40.365
Well, want me to walk with you?

08:40.366 --> 08:43.034
Lots of scary ex-boyfriends
in this neighborhood.

08:43.037 --> 08:44.870
Sure.

08:45.805 --> 08:47.406
I do want to hear
the rest of that story.

08:47.408 --> 08:49.107
Right, right the story.

08:49.109 --> 08:50.209
Yeah.

08:50.211 --> 08:53.545
So, we decided
to take it to the groom.

08:53.547 --> 08:55.180
Did you say Gary Blauman?

08:55.182 --> 08:56.348
Yeah.

08:56.350 --> 08:57.649
Gary Blauman?

08:57.651 --> 08:58.450
Yes.

08:58.452 --> 09:01.520
Blauman... comma, Gary?

09:01.522 --> 09:03.822
Point, comma,
get to the damn.

09:03.824 --> 09:06.658
I...

09:13.433 --> 09:15.234
love...

09:15.236 --> 09:17.402
that we have the opportunity
to destroy

09:17.404 --> 09:20.539
Gary Blauman's weekend by
kicking him out of the wedding!

09:20.541 --> 09:23.909
Yes! Gary Blauman Haters' Club
right here!

09:23.911 --> 09:25.744
What that guy did to me.

09:25.746 --> 09:28.347
Oh... God!

09:28.349 --> 09:29.414
It makes me

09:29.416 --> 09:31.583
furious to this day!

09:31.585 --> 09:34.019
Okay, okay, I'm gonna try
and tell this story

09:34.021 --> 09:35.621
without completely losing it.

09:35.623 --> 09:37.689
Ready? Okay, here goes.

09:37.691 --> 09:39.224
I was at the...

09:42.462 --> 09:44.029
Nope, not gonna happen.
Give me a second.

09:44.031 --> 09:45.597
Ooh!
Ooh!

09:45.599 --> 09:47.299
I was at the bar.

09:47.301 --> 09:49.167
Hey, Barney!

09:49.169 --> 09:50.502
What's up, Blauman?
Have a seat.

09:50.504 --> 09:51.737
Oh, thanks.

09:51.739 --> 09:54.239
Your fries.
Need anything?

09:54.241 --> 09:55.941
I'm good, thanks.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.810
Oh, but he was not good, thanks.

09:58.812 --> 10:01.079
He was not good, thanks, at all!

10:01.081 --> 10:04.116
Oh, what? Did he take
one of your fries?

10:04.118 --> 10:05.817
Take one?

10:06.753 --> 10:08.420
Take one?

10:08.422 --> 10:10.188
Lily, it would have been
one thing

10:10.190 --> 10:13.158
if he took one of my fries;
that would have been one thing.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.861
No, Lily, that day,

10:15.863 --> 10:18.030
Blauman took...

10:21.467 --> 10:23.935
...four of my fries!

10:23.937 --> 10:26.271
But that's not even the capper!

10:26.273 --> 10:28.774
<i>Here's the part that still</i>
<i>keeps me up at night:</i>

10:28.776 --> 10:30.709
<i>the fourth fry he took...</i>

10:30.711 --> 10:33.245
the fourth fry he took...

10:36.116 --> 10:37.816
Buddy, you oka... you okay?

10:40.487 --> 10:43.088
The fourth fry he took...

10:45.491 --> 10:47.759
...was an accidental curly.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:59.906 --> 11:02.841
You don't take
a man's accidental curly.

11:02.843 --> 11:03.909
You take a man's wife

11:03.911 --> 11:06.478
before you take
his accidental curly.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.312
If you wanted

11:07.314 --> 11:09.047
curly fries so bad,

11:09.049 --> 11:11.483
why not just order them
in the first place?

11:11.485 --> 11:12.551
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:12.553 --> 11:13.852
'Cause that's
what you want.

11:13.854 --> 11:15.721
All curly fries.

11:15.723 --> 11:18.457
Regular cut with
a few accidental curlies.

11:18.459 --> 11:19.624
That's what you want.

11:19.626 --> 11:21.126
That's the dream.
He's right.

11:21.128 --> 11:23.228
That is the dream.
No!

11:23.230 --> 11:25.364
I refuse to look
down from the altar

11:25.366 --> 11:28.500
as I say my vowels to
the woman of my dreams,

11:28.502 --> 11:31.703
and see that
damned, stupid,

11:31.705 --> 11:33.705
accidental-curly-
fry-stealing

11:33.707 --> 11:35.674
Gary Blauman!

11:35.676 --> 11:37.008
Did you say Gary Blauman?

11:37.810 --> 11:40.078
I...

11:40.080 --> 11:41.747
hate...

11:41.749 --> 11:43.382
to disagree with Barney.

11:44.050 --> 11:45.517
But I love that guy!

11:45.519 --> 11:48.353
<i>I just met him earlier today.</i>

11:48.355 --> 11:49.821
Oh, my gosh!

11:49.823 --> 11:50.922
It's you.

11:50.924 --> 11:52.057
Yeah.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.259
You're the poet William Zabka.

11:55.762 --> 11:58.163
Nobody ever recognizes me
for my poetry.

11:58.165 --> 12:00.031
He has all six
of my collections.

12:00.933 --> 12:02.067
When Terry Gross interviewed me

12:02.069 --> 12:04.302
on <i>Fresh Air,</i> he listened live.

12:04.871 --> 12:07.272
Gary Blauman rules!

12:07.274 --> 12:08.573
Gary Blauman?

12:09.075 --> 12:11.743
I...

12:12.612 --> 12:13.745
hate...

12:14.914 --> 12:16.715
...that I once thought
I loved Gary Blauman.

12:16.717 --> 12:19.284
Ooh, this sounds good.

12:19.286 --> 12:21.920
Gary's the guy
that I had an affair with.

12:21.922 --> 12:25.690
Tom found out,
threw me out of the house.

12:25.692 --> 12:28.760
Now the kids are
from a broken home.

12:28.762 --> 12:32.297
Because of Gary Blauman,
everything that matters to me

12:32.299 --> 12:34.399
is gone.

12:37.303 --> 12:38.804
I got that beat.

12:38.806 --> 12:40.338
So, I was ordering
these fries...

12:40.340 --> 12:41.840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:41.842 --> 12:42.841
Blauman's gay?

12:42.843 --> 12:43.942
Well...

12:43.944 --> 12:45.577
then that means that night,

12:45.579 --> 12:49.548
the real battle
was between Blauman

12:49.550 --> 12:51.450
and the girl.

12:51.452 --> 12:54.719
And the prize... was this guy.

12:56.089 --> 12:57.489
Keep telling yourself
that, buddy.

12:57.491 --> 12:59.191
I don't want to see Gary Blauman
at my brother's wedding.

12:59.193 --> 13:00.311
Neither do I!

13:00.336 --> 13:01.427
I'm the brother in question!
Now, now, hold on.

13:04.331 --> 13:06.465
Order! Order!

13:06.467 --> 13:09.434
Robin put this on my plate,
and so I'll make the decision.

13:09.436 --> 13:12.003
Now, let's take a short recess.

13:12.005 --> 13:12.971
Everybody out.

13:12.973 --> 13:14.439
Okay.

13:14.441 --> 13:17.342
Lily, out of court settlement.

13:17.344 --> 13:20.045
Drop this whole thing,
and I'll give you ten bucks.

13:20.047 --> 13:21.947
No.

13:24.317 --> 13:26.518
I can't go higher than ten.

13:28.789 --> 13:32.624
I'm ready to give
my decision.

13:32.626 --> 13:33.725
This was a tough one.

13:33.727 --> 13:35.527
Lot of good points
on both sides.

13:35.529 --> 13:38.396
But ultimately... Blauman stays.

13:38.398 --> 13:39.464
Yeah.
What in the...?

13:39.466 --> 13:40.799
For one simple reason.

13:40.801 --> 13:43.935
There is a higher law
at every wedding.

13:43.937 --> 13:46.471
A law that trumps
all other arguments.

13:46.473 --> 13:49.841
When the bride asks
for something, she gets it.

13:49.843 --> 13:50.709
Yes.

13:50.711 --> 13:52.210
- Wow.
- Good point.

13:52.212 --> 13:53.378
He's right.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.780
This fake court thing
is adjourned.

13:55.782 --> 13:58.717
Judged.

13:58.719 --> 14:00.485
Well, I guess
let's go find Blauman

14:00.487 --> 14:01.887
and tell him the good news.

14:01.889 --> 14:03.588
Yeah, about that.
Bit of a wrinkle.

14:03.590 --> 14:05.924
I was just in the hallway,
ran into Blauman.

14:05.926 --> 14:07.859
I told him
if he didn't leave immediately,

14:07.861 --> 14:09.995
then Billy Zabka was gonna
crane-kick him in the face.

14:09.997 --> 14:11.096
What?!

14:11.098 --> 14:12.731
But that's not
even my move!

14:12.733 --> 14:13.598
I...

14:13.600 --> 14:14.533
We have to stop him.

14:14.535 --> 14:15.901
Barney!
I...

14:15.903 --> 14:17.669
Come on, come on, come on.

14:17.671 --> 14:19.170
So, we all run out
to the parking lot

14:19.172 --> 14:21.740
to stop Gary Blauman from
leaving the wedding...

14:22.675 --> 14:24.442
What are you doing?

14:24.444 --> 14:25.844
This is my place.

14:25.846 --> 14:28.480
Oh.

14:28.482 --> 14:29.948
So, uh...

14:29.950 --> 14:33.151
well, I guess this...
this is where I leave you.

14:37.589 --> 14:39.557
This is your place.

14:39.559 --> 14:41.326
Yup.

14:41.328 --> 14:44.262
You sure it's not
a few blocks that way?

14:44.264 --> 14:46.664
Nope, it's right here.

14:46.666 --> 14:48.933
It's right
where you picked me up.

14:48.935 --> 14:50.601
So it is.

14:52.404 --> 14:55.740
Well... good night.

14:55.742 --> 14:56.774
Good night.

14:58.243 --> 14:59.978
<i>Eight years earlier,</i>
<i>I probably would've given</i>

14:59.980 --> 15:01.546
<i>some embarrassing speech,</i>
<i>confessed my love</i>

15:01.548 --> 15:02.780
<i>and scared her off.</i>

15:02.782 --> 15:04.282
<i>But I didn't.</i>

15:04.284 --> 15:07.251
<i>Because somehow I just knew</i>
<i>this was all gonna work out.</i>

15:07.253 --> 15:09.087
Ted?
Oh, thank God.

15:13.759 --> 15:16.627
Do you at least want
to finish your story?

15:16.629 --> 15:19.731
Right.

15:19.733 --> 15:23.034
So, we all ran out
to the parking lot, and...

15:23.036 --> 15:25.269
Blauman, Blauman,
I'm sorry.

15:25.271 --> 15:27.372
You can stay. Billy won't
kick you in the face.

15:27.374 --> 15:28.673
It's not even my move.

15:28.675 --> 15:30.675
If I was gonna do anything,
I'd sweep the leg,

15:30.677 --> 15:32.877
and put you in a body bag;
everyone knows that.

15:32.879 --> 15:35.480
What...?
Is that from one of your poems?

15:35.482 --> 15:37.248
Thank you for that.

15:38.217 --> 15:40.084
Please stick around,
for the bride.

15:40.086 --> 15:42.453
You're not a Taft.
Even if you are,

15:42.455 --> 15:44.022
Roosevelt shouldn't have
divided the party like that.

15:44.024 --> 15:45.656
I mean, he handed the
election to Wilson.

15:45.658 --> 15:47.325
Completely, right?
Right? Right?

15:48.395 --> 15:50.395
No, wait! No! All right?

15:50.397 --> 15:51.629
Forget it!

15:52.498 --> 15:54.298
And, James, I'm sorry

15:54.300 --> 15:55.533
about you and Tom.

15:55.535 --> 15:58.236
But you have to stop blaming me
for your own decisions.

15:59.138 --> 16:01.773
Well, guys, take a good look.

16:01.775 --> 16:05.209
This face you won't
be seeing again.

16:06.912 --> 16:09.781
Come...

16:09.783 --> 16:11.049
The bri... the bri...

16:11.051 --> 16:13.551
Gary?

16:15.154 --> 16:16.854
He's really leaving.

16:16.856 --> 16:18.156
Hey, Barney.

16:18.957 --> 16:20.825
You still, uh,
have my wedding ring?

16:20.827 --> 16:23.261
Yeah.

16:24.563 --> 16:26.697
I've got some work to do.

16:26.699 --> 16:28.933
Excuse me.

16:31.737 --> 16:33.104
Blauman will cool off
eventually.

16:33.106 --> 16:34.272
We'll see him again.

16:34.274 --> 16:35.139
Of course we will.

16:35.141 --> 16:36.407
I don't know.

16:36.409 --> 16:38.810
I mean, we might
really never see him again.

16:38.812 --> 16:41.079
Because I remember
at our wedding

16:41.081 --> 16:42.480
looking out and thinking,

16:42.482 --> 16:44.849
"Man, everyone here means
so much to me."

16:45.584 --> 16:46.884
A bunch of those people,

16:46.886 --> 16:49.320
you know,
I haven't seen them since.

16:49.322 --> 16:51.289
<i>And that's how it goes, kids.</i>

16:51.291 --> 16:54.158
<i>The friends, neighbors,</i>
<i>drinking buddies</i>

16:54.160 --> 16:56.160
<i>and partners in crime</i>
<i>you love so much</i>

16:56.162 --> 16:58.996
<i>when you're young,</i>
<i>as the years go by,</i>

16:58.998 --> 17:00.865
<i>you just lose touch.</i>

17:03.168 --> 17:04.535
<i>That being said,</i>

17:04.537 --> 17:07.438

<i>Carl's still behind the bar</i>
<i>at MacLaren's.</i>

17:10.609 --> 17:12.477
Hey, watch it over there.

17:12.479 --> 17:13.978
Yeah, watch it over there!

17:13.980 --> 17:15.880
It's become a family business.

17:15.882 --> 17:17.748
<i>Jeanette was arrested</i>
<i>for mailing jars of urine</i>

17:17.750 --> 17:18.983

17:18.984 --> 17:20.117
<i>No, not that Val Kilmer.</i>

17:20.119 --> 17:21.986
<i>She narrowly avoided</i>
<i>prison time,</i>

17:21.988 --> 17:25.189

not allowed to date my...

17:42.542 --> 17:44.242

17:46.679 --> 17:48.446

Because
sometimes I just feel like

17:50.617 --> 17:52.083
he never listens to me,
you know?

17:52.085 --> 17:54.252
Gosh, caller,
that's a real pickle.

Damn it, Patrice,
I'm not finished!

18:19.679 --> 18:22.280
Aah, no! I'm your friend!
I'm helping you!

18:22.282 --> 18:24.182
<i>Still, it's nice knowing</i>
<i>she's out there</i>

18:24.184 --> 18:25.750
<i>fighting the good fight.</i>

18:25.752 --> 18:27.185
<i>Scooter's been married</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

18:27.187 --> 18:28.920
<i>Apparently, he met</i>
<i>a girl at work,</i>

18:28.922 --> 18:30.488
and it was love at first sight.

18:30.490 --> 18:33.391
<i>I guess something about her</i>
<i>helped him get over Lily.</i>

18:33.393 --> 18:35.459
You look beautiful today,
Jasmine.

18:35.461 --> 18:37.295
Like every day.

18:37.297 --> 18:39.964
Move. I serve
sloppy joe now.

18:39.966 --> 18:42.567
Blitz struggled with a gambling
<i>addiction for a while.</i>

18:42.569 --> 18:45.603
<i>But after a three-day bender</i>
<i>on the same slot machine,</i>

18:45.605 --> 18:46.704
<i>he finally kicked it.</i>

18:46.706 --> 18:48.906
I got to get help.

18:53.812 --> 18:56.714
Yes!

18:56.716 --> 18:58.549
Aw, man!

18:58.551 --> 19:00.651
<i>I'm not sure what happened</i>
<i>to Blah Blah.</i>

19:00.653 --> 19:03.020
<i>But I'd like to think</i>
<i>that wherever she is, she...</i>

19:03.022 --> 19:05.756
<i>Carol! Her name was Carol!</i>

19:05.758 --> 19:07.158
Thank you.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.793
<i>Sandy Rivers' inappropriate</i>
<i>office behavior</i>

19:08.795 --> 19:11.762
<i>finally caught up with him,</i>
<i>ending his news career...</i>

19:11.764 --> 19:13.297
<i>in America.</i>

19:25.811 --> 19:27.411
<i>He hasn't changed.</i>

19:27.413 --> 19:30.047
<i>It took some doing,</i>
<i>but James finally convinced Tom</i>

19:30.049 --> 19:32.049
<i>to take him back.</i>

19:32.051 --> 19:35.953
<i>And nobody's happier about it</i>
<i>than their kids.</i>

19:35.955 --> 19:40.524
Hey, kids, have I ever told you
how I met your father?

19:40.526 --> 19:42.026
It was at a party.

19:42.028 --> 19:44.962
<i>And as for Blauman...</i>

19:47.232 --> 19:48.766
Guys, wait!

19:50.003 --> 19:51.469
I'm sorry for storming off
like that.

19:51.471 --> 19:53.170
I don't want to miss
this wedding.

19:53.172 --> 19:55.306
<i>You will be shocked, kids,</i>

19:55.308 --> 19:57.308
<i>when you discover</i>
<i>how easy it is in life</i>

19:57.310 --> 19:59.543
<i>to part ways</i>
<i>with people forever.</i>

19:59.545 --> 20:02.446
<i>That's why</i>
<i>when you find someone</i>

20:02.448 --> 20:06.617
<i>you want to keep around,</i>
<i>you do something about it.</i>

20:06.619 --> 20:09.120
So, I guess...

20:09.122 --> 20:10.721
good night.

20:11.957 --> 20:14.892
Good night.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.611
Unless...

20:33.613 --> 20:35.713
do you want
to walk around some more?

20:35.715 --> 20:37.248
It's still early.

20:38.550 --> 20:41.185
Sure.

20:46.358 --> 20:48.592
What are you doing?

20:51.229 --> 20:53.397
Remembering this.

20:54.966 --> 20:56.233
Come on.
