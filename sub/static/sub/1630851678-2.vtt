00:43.001 --> 00:45.045
[frogs croaking]

00:54.179 --> 00:55.138
[yawns]

00:57.015 --> 00:58.684
[all] Where you going,
Anne?

00:58.684 --> 01:00.686
Uh, the mailbox.

01:00.686 --> 01:01.979
Sounds exciting.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.814
Can we come?
Please?
[grunting]

01:03.814 --> 01:05.816
Uh... yeah. I guess.

01:05.816 --> 01:06.692
[both] Yay!
Whoo‐hoo!

01:10.612 --> 01:12.531
[squeaks]

01:12.531 --> 01:15.617
You know,
I used to only get the mail
to intercept my report card.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.952
But these days‐‐ Huh?

01:18.370 --> 01:19.997
Hey, smallish humans.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.542
[screams]
Hey! Watch it!

01:23.542 --> 01:25.168
You overgrown stinkbugs!

01:26.253 --> 01:27.921
What did you call us?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.007
Sorry, sorry.
She's just a baby.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.134
[chuckles]
Weirdest baby
I've ever seen.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.010
[growls]

01:36.013 --> 01:37.889
Ooh! That looks fun.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.349
[Anne] Sprig, no!
[grunts]

01:39.349 --> 01:40.475
[pants]

01:40.475 --> 01:42.060
[Hop Pop]
A free vacation?
[gasps]

01:42.060 --> 01:43.895
Just for listening
to your talk?

01:43.895 --> 01:45.439
Well, sign me up.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.732
[grunts]

01:49.359 --> 01:51.403
[sighs]

01:51.403 --> 01:52.571
[gulping]

01:52.571 --> 01:53.947
Ah!

01:53.947 --> 01:54.781
Something wrong,
kiddo?

01:54.781 --> 01:56.074
Where do I start?

01:56.074 --> 01:57.701
Polly nearly got
in a fight.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.870
Hop Pop was seconds away
from getting scammed.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.372
And Sprig almost got
turned into wood chips.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.957
Wait. Sprig is made
out of wood?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.625
[groans]

02:05.625 --> 02:07.919
I'm exhausted just trying
to keep them all alive.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.423
[laughs] Sounds like
being a parent.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.342
The trick is to ease them
into the world.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.720
Slow and steady like how
I'm easing this egg into‐‐

02:16.720 --> 02:18.221
Dang it!

02:18.221 --> 02:21.808
Just be patient.
This is a lot of new
for them.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.394
Yeah, you're right.
Slow and steady.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.104
[vocalizes, gasps]

02:26.104 --> 02:27.105
Bleh!

02:27.105 --> 02:28.357
Think you're tough?

02:28.357 --> 02:30.108
Bring it on,
humans.

02:30.108 --> 02:33.612
Free money?
And all I have to do is give you
my bank account numbers?

02:33.612 --> 02:37.157
[inhales, screaming]

02:37.157 --> 02:39.451
[grunting]
Nope.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.953
Slow and steady
ain't gonna cut it.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.580
You three will be dead
in two days.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.332
Is that a threat?
You okay, Anne?

02:45.332 --> 02:49.169
Here. Take this free
stress test I got
from that guy.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.839
No. The responsible thing
to do is to train you
all at once

02:52.839 --> 02:55.967
at the most chaotic
and dangerous place I know.

03:00.514 --> 03:05.686
The mall... where I learned
life's most important skills.

03:05.686 --> 03:09.523
And where you're gonna learn
the lessons you need to survive
in my world.

03:09.523 --> 03:13.235
[scoffs] Survive?
Your world is soft, Anne.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.113
Yeah. I mean,
the animals don't even try
to disembowel you.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.572
Yeah, we don't need
no stinking‐‐

03:17.572 --> 03:19.491
[all scream]

03:19.491 --> 03:20.575
Ow!

03:20.575 --> 03:22.494
[clears throat] Proceed.

03:22.494 --> 03:25.580
I've come up
with a specific task
for each of you.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.125
First up, Polly. You need
to control your temper.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.876
It's drawing
too much attention,

03:29.876 --> 03:31.670
and we're trying
to keep a low profile.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.755
I say what I want
when I want!

03:33.755 --> 03:35.966
Maybe in Wartwood,
but not here.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.843
Your mission is to go
into that store

03:37.843 --> 03:40.679
and build a custom plushy
without fighting anyone.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.889
Huh. Child's play.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.351
Sprig,
you can't touch everything
or you're gonna lose a limb.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.688
But there's
so many new surfaces
and textures.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.399
Your mission is
to walk through that gallery
of art installations

03:52.399 --> 03:54.276
without touching
any of them.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.735
Eh,
looks simple enough.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.320
Finally, Hop Pop.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.489
You need to stop taking
free stuff.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.242
In my world,
everything has a price.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.911
Then why did they
call it "free," Anne?

04:04.911 --> 04:09.249
Hmm? Because they think
I'm gullible and easily scammed?

04:09.249 --> 04:12.169
Yep.
Oh, well, that's actually
pretty clever.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.629
Your mission is to make it
through Kiosk Alley

04:14.629 --> 04:16.923
without falling
for any free scams.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.842
[laughs]

04:18.842 --> 04:20.969
I'll be watching all of you
from up here.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.971
You got 20 minutes
to complete your missions.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.390
And if one of us
screws up?

04:25.390 --> 04:30.395
Then you can't be trusted
to leave the house... ever.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.856
No way! Scatter!
Since when do you
set the stakes?

04:32.856 --> 04:33.982
[all scream, grunt]

04:33.982 --> 04:34.983
Oh, boy.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.404
Piece of cake!
[blows raspberry]

04:39.404 --> 04:41.531
Hmm. This will do.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.991
Yoink, yoink.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.494
Hmm. No, thanks.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.247
Don't know why Anne thought
this would be difficult.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.750
Huh?
[babbles]

04:51.750 --> 04:54.753
[Anne] <i>Build a custom plushy</i>

04:54.753 --> 04:56.505
Oh, hello there.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.340
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.883
But that's‐‐
[spits]

04:59.883 --> 05:02.010
What the‐‐
Hey, lady!

05:02.010 --> 05:03.887
Your chubby spawn
is ruining my work.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.097
Did you just call
my kid a spawn?

05:06.097 --> 05:09.059
[thinking] <i>Focus, Polly.</i>
<i>Don't make a scene.</i>

05:09.059 --> 05:11.311
[sighs]
Know what?
It's fine.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.938
I'll just get more‐‐
Hey!
[babbles]

05:12.938 --> 05:14.773
‐Hey!
‐[giggling]

05:16.817 --> 05:21.071
Must contain fury!

05:23.406 --> 05:25.659
Whoa!

05:25.659 --> 05:28.119
Such textures
to explore.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.289
[gasps] Whoa!

05:31.289 --> 05:33.375
[grunts, giggles]

[Anne] <i>Then you can't be trusted</i>

05:38.505 --> 05:41.132
Whoa. It's fine.
Totally fine.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.677
I can just look
and appreciate
from afar.

[pants, groans]

05:58.275 --> 06:02.028
[grunts]
Come on, Sprig.
Fight it.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.029
[groans]

06:06.366 --> 06:08.159
Must be some kind
of performance piece.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.289
Sir, how would you like
a free gift card?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.457
[groans]
You there, do you wanna
regrow that hair?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.209
I know you do.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.588
Hey there, handsome.
Wanna start your modeling career
with some headshots?

06:19.588 --> 06:21.006
Just need your ID.

06:21.006 --> 06:24.843
It's 100%,
no strings attached, free.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.679
[groaning]

06:27.679 --> 06:29.723
[gasps, grunts]

06:29.723 --> 06:31.808
[stomach rumbling]
Oof.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.477
It's the last time
I get sushi out of
the vending machine. Hmm?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.192
[gasps] Mark here.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.988
Got a suspicious
looking COD,
Creepy Old Dude, on radar.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.031
I'm in pursuit.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.576
[hums] So far, so good.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.996
The Anne Boonchuy trial by fire
is really paying off.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.789
OMG. Anne!
Is it really you?

06:56.207 --> 06:57.792
Where have you been?

06:57.792 --> 07:00.587
Is it true you went missing
or ran away or died
or something?

07:00.587 --> 07:03.465
Don't be ridiculous, Gabby.
I was just on my family's farm.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.676
In Alaska.
For five months.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.888
Well, now that you're back
I got to catch you up
on all the hot goss.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.973
Listen,
I'm sorta‐‐
So...

07:11.973 --> 07:14.643
Bridget got mad at Carlos
'cause she thought Carlos
went to the movies with Johanna.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.519
But it was actually
Yoko.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.730
So then Yoko and Bridget
stopped being BFFs until
they both got mad at Tommy,

07:18.730 --> 07:21.524
because Tommy said,
"We've only been dating
since second grade.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.901
We're not soul mates."

07:22.901 --> 07:24.694
[groaning]

07:24.694 --> 07:26.363
I can't do this.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.449
These things
are just so cool.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.035
Yeah. And then I said,
"Dude, you're gonna get caught."

07:32.035 --> 07:33.078
Right? So obvious.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.205
Chance.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.169
Touch.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.923
Feeling.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.176
[chuckles]

07:55.433 --> 07:56.351
Uh‐oh.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.562
Whoa!

07:59.562 --> 08:01.147
[screams, grunts]

08:02.440 --> 08:05.860
[babies babbling]
Almost done. Ha!

08:05.860 --> 08:07.946
[grunts, laughs]

08:07.946 --> 08:09.447
Whoa!

08:11.241 --> 08:12.450
[babbles]

08:12.450 --> 08:14.327
No! Please!

08:14.327 --> 08:18.373
I'm so tired!
This madness needs
to stop!

08:18.373 --> 08:19.332
[babbles]

08:22.544 --> 08:24.504
That's it!

Can someone get
the manager?

08:35.390 --> 08:37.392
[chuckles]
Take that, Anne.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.894
Told you your world
was easy‐pea‐‐
[gasps]

08:41.646 --> 08:44.524
It can't be.
Thousands of coppers just there
for the taking.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.026
For free!

08:47.235 --> 08:48.445
They didn't know it,

08:48.445 --> 08:50.238
but they ended up going
to the same restaurant.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.614
Chance.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.368
[gasps]

08:55.368 --> 08:58.538
We got a disrober
stealing wishes in progress.
Over.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.373
So what started out
as a love triangle

09:00.373 --> 09:02.876
is now some kind of disgusting
love rhombus.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.252

09:04.252 --> 09:05.462

09:05.462 --> 09:06.755
[grunting]

09:06.755 --> 09:08.882
I may have touched
something!

09:08.882 --> 09:11.092
Oh, shoot!
Good to see you, Gabs.
Got to go.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.011
Later, Anne.
Glad you made it
back from Alaska.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.098
[Sprig, Polly screaming]

09:17.098 --> 09:19.851
Gangway!
Angry moms coming through!

09:19.851 --> 09:21.227
[all crying]

09:21.227 --> 09:22.937
Oh. At least it can't
get any worse.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.481
[Hop Pop]
Help me, Anne!
Help me!

09:24.481 --> 09:25.815
[screams]

09:25.815 --> 09:28.735
Hop Pop,
why are you green?

09:28.735 --> 09:31.029
The cursed fountain did
this to me.

09:31.029 --> 09:35.241
You were right, Anne!
Everything has its price.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.286
Okay, first things first.
Gotta clean up this mess.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.913
You're doing great,
sweetie.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.706

the difference.

Oh, hey. Bada‐bing.

09:53.343 --> 09:56.304
‐Ooh.
‐[babies crying]

09:57.680 --> 09:59.265
Can I help you,
ladies?

09:59.265 --> 10:01.392
Why, yes.
We're looking
for a ruffian

10:01.392 --> 10:03.686
who was making trouble
for our little angels.

10:03.686 --> 10:04.938
I've got just the guy.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.648
Excuse me, sir.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.191
I have a number of ladies here
who would like to complain.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.528
You listen here...
[all chattering]

10:11.528 --> 10:15.240
Headquarters,
I've got a pack of MIDs.
That is Moms In Distress.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.117
Send backup!
Send backup!

10:17.117 --> 10:18.660
[woman]
...the manager.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.286
[all panting]

10:22.622 --> 10:25.166
[all panting]

10:25.166 --> 10:27.127
Well, guess
we failed our trials.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.253
Oh, you think?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.839
No, no.
I'm the one who failed.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.882
I shouldn't have put
you guys through all of this
in the first place.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.926
It was too much,
too soon.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.845
Don't feel too bad.

10:36.845 --> 10:40.765
Turns out we could stand
to learn a few things
about your world.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.601
I just really thought
throwing you into
the deep end would work.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.645
I mean, it worked
for me in Amphibia.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.855
[all] Uh...

10:46.855 --> 10:49.065
‐[scoffing, laughing]
‐Whoa!

10:49.065 --> 10:52.068
You barely survived.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.362
Yeah. Remember when she
was looking at her phone

10:54.362 --> 10:56.447
and walked right into
that pool of quicksand?

10:56.447 --> 10:57.949
[screams]

10:57.949 --> 10:59.534
Or when she
was napping outside

10:59.534 --> 11:02.078
and a swarm of skullsuckers
tried to carry her away?

11:03.538 --> 11:05.707
[all laughing]

11:05.707 --> 11:07.750
Hey, I don't remember
that last part.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.503
Anne, we were always
looking out for you.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.714
Even if you didn't
always notice.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.049
Thanks, guys.
I had no idea.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.343
And I'll try to do better
about easing you into
this place.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.431
I think we need
to get Hop Pop
to a shower.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.725
Oh, yes, please.
My skin is burning.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.103
[frogs croaking]

11:37.530 --> 11:39.616
‐[grunts]
‐[King Andrias] The box!

11:42.577 --> 11:43.703
Marcy!

11:50.501 --> 11:53.546
No! She managed
to open the portal.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.215
Well, no matter.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.762
I still have the box.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.140
So, what about you two?
Are you with me?

12:04.140 --> 12:06.059
We're with you.
Definitely with you.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.561
Good. Get her to
a rejuvenation tank.
And make it snappy.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.147
She's fading fast.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.607
There's nothing
we can do for her.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.359
Now let's move
before someone‐‐

12:18.655 --> 12:20.240
So what's the plan,
Captain?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.575
I'm gonna have to toss you
out the window.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.534
The window?

12:23.534 --> 12:25.203
No, Grime!

12:25.203 --> 12:26.537
[screaming]

12:26.537 --> 12:27.872
[screams, grunts]

12:27.872 --> 12:30.375
Ha! Ha!
A flawless escape.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.294
And did you have a plan
for after you threw us
out a window?

12:33.294 --> 12:35.255
[shrieks]

12:36.589 --> 12:38.508
[shrieks]

12:38.508 --> 12:39.926
Well, that's lucky.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.886
Excellent work,
George Sparrow.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.971
[squawks]

12:42.971 --> 12:46.474
Anne, Marcy,
please be all right.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.145
So many loose ends.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.730
So little time.

12:53.731 --> 12:54.941
Follow them.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.364
[Grime] Our army
has been captured.

13:01.364 --> 13:04.659
Looks like we'll have
to take shelter somewhere
and come up with a new strategy.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.369
Okay, but where
do we even go?

13:06.369 --> 13:09.122
Your tower? Andrias will
be expecting that.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.666
Then we'll have to go somewhere
he doesn't expect.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.629
Look up there
in the sky.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.131
[chirping]

13:20.049 --> 13:21.926
What in the frog
is going on?

13:21.926 --> 13:23.136
Why are you two here?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.179
Is it just me
or is the palace flying?

13:25.179 --> 13:26.681
Where are the Plantars?
Where's Anne?

13:26.681 --> 13:27.807
Where's Sprig?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.058
What do we tell them?

13:29.058 --> 13:30.685
Not the truth.
That's for sure.

13:30.685 --> 13:35.481
[clears throat]
People of Wartwood,
we have terrible news.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.569
The king has turned out
to be a ruthless tyrant
of unspeakable power.

13:39.569 --> 13:40.903
[all gasp]

13:40.903 --> 13:42.447
Well, I never voted
for him.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.074
Anne and the Plantars had
to go on a daring mission.

13:45.074 --> 13:49.037
But they send us
to protect you fine frogs
in the meantime.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.830
Right, Sasha?

13:50.830 --> 13:54.834
There's no way
they're gonna trust us just
because we name‐dropped Anne.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.377
Not with that attitude.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.254
[Mrs. Croaker]
Oh, what a relief.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.215
Classic Anne.
Always looking out for us.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.176
Why, that's wonderful.

14:03.176 --> 14:07.597
Rest easy tonight, folks,
because Anne's best friend
is here to watch over us.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.558
[all cheering]

14:12.977 --> 14:17.648
Okay. We'll lay low here
and then in a day or two,
we'll ditch this crummy town.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.150
Dibs on Hop Pop's bed.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.489
You gonna come in
or just stand there
and be weird?

14:24.489 --> 14:26.282
I‐‐ I think I'll sleep
in the barn.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.409
[grunts]

14:30.328 --> 14:31.621
[snores]

14:33.372 --> 14:35.666
Now that is a big potato.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.628
[chirps]

14:38.628 --> 14:40.713
[gasps]
Oh, a tiny snail.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.716
[chirps]
And a bigger snail.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.095
Well, don't mind me.
I'm gonna go sleep in the corner
with the rest of the trash.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.515
It's all
someone like me deserves.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.852
[rooster crows]

14:54.852 --> 14:56.145
[snorts] Who is it?
Where am I?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.688
Of course this is my
natural hair color.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.733
Rise and shine.
I made worm waffles.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.110
[worms squeaking]

15:02.110 --> 15:04.070
I'm not hungry.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.490
Look, I get you feel guilty
about tricking your friends

15:07.490 --> 15:10.284
and inadvertently helping
the king get the music box.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.786
But you've got to get
ahold of yourself.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.913
[grunts]

15:13.913 --> 15:16.874
We need to be in fighting shape
if we're going to
take down Andrias and‐‐

15:16.874 --> 15:18.209
[horn honks]
What's that sound?

15:18.209 --> 15:19.585
[both scream]

15:21.045 --> 15:23.840
Ooh! I love
an enthusiastic welcome.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.718
I just wanted to thank you again
for watching over the town.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.512
Ooh! Boysenbug!

15:29.512 --> 15:32.557
Gonna go inside and heat
this bad boy up.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.059
I wasn't sure
about those two,
Archie,

15:35.059 --> 15:36.727
but they turned out
to be good eggs.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.187
[sighs]

15:38.187 --> 15:39.438
[Wally] Hello!

15:39.438 --> 15:40.857
Oh, no.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.859
[concertina playing]

15:42.859 --> 15:45.987
[laughs]
Any friend of Anne's
is a friend of mine.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.947
That's touching.
Look, I got to go.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.032
Yes, she's taught me
many lessons.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.993
Showing me the importance
of honesty,

15:51.993 --> 15:54.662
[grunts]
being true to yourself,
the meaning of friendship.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.581
I've been working on
a song about it.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.583
[vocalizes]
No!
Can't right now.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.335
Very busy protecting
the town for Anne
and stuff.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.380
[groans]
I swear if one more
country bumpkin‐‐

16:04.380 --> 16:06.174
[screams]
Free bread, anyone?

16:06.174 --> 16:07.466
[grunts]
Get away from me!

16:09.260 --> 16:11.679
Don't want
the extra carbs, eh?
I get it.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.391
[chomping]
[sighs]

16:15.391 --> 16:18.644
Great news.
I got a message from Beatrix.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.480
She's hiding underground
with the toads
that avoided capture.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.691
They've got weapons,
soldiers and fortification.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.359
We've got to join her.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.654
Why? So we can come up
with another cruddy plan
that fails

16:28.654 --> 16:30.448
and ends up hurting
the people we love?

16:30.448 --> 16:32.658
[groans]
No need to be a downer.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.285
You want another strawberry,
little guy?

16:34.285 --> 16:35.703
Yes, you do.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.247
Look, I don't know.
Maybe we're doing
this all wrong.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.958
[crash]
[grunts]
What is it this time?

16:40.958 --> 16:43.211
Look, just take the muffins
or cake or whatever else you‐‐

16:43.211 --> 16:44.170
Oh.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.010
They must have
tracked us here.
Go for the legs.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.938
[screaming]

17:02.939 --> 17:04.357
<i>Signal reinforcements.</i>

17:06.108 --> 17:08.152
Dang thing was calling
for help.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.947
There's probably
a whole army of them
on their way now.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.032
Let's pack up.
We're getting out of here.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.701
What? We can't leave these frogs
to face them on their own.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.870
What about that old lady
who gave us a pie?

17:17.870 --> 17:20.581
Lieutenant, these bumpkins
will only slow us down.

17:20.581 --> 17:23.167
And if I'm being honest,
that piecrust was soggy.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.419
I know it's harsh,
but Wartwood is done for.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.046
We need to rejoin
our forces

17:27.046 --> 17:29.006
and make plans
for the coming war.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.261
No, enough with the plans
and the schemes.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.762
‐I'm done.
‐What?

17:34.762 --> 17:36.472
But you love schemes.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.892
Lies,
manipulation, backstabbing,
it's, like, your thing.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.394
Since when have you cared?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.063
Since I saw
the consequences.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.649
[sighs]
Listen, Lieutenant,

17:46.649 --> 17:49.443
whatever you're dealing with,
you need to confront it.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.488
Go into that house,
face what burdens you.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.950
Then when you've got your head
back on straight, come join me.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.034
Please.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.926
[Anne] <i>Sasha, Marcy and I</i>
<i>are finally together.</i>

18:13.926 --> 18:15.886
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>It's awesome.</i>

18:15.886 --> 18:18.180
<i>Tomorrow we head to Newtopia.</i>

18:18.180 --> 18:20.766
<i>And after that I think</i>
<i>we're actually going home.</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:22.935
<i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>I trusted Sasha again.</i>

18:22.935 --> 18:27.189
<i>I always knew, even after</i>
<i>everything that happened,</i>
<i>we'd work it out.</i>

18:27.189 --> 18:30.401
[sobbing] Oh, Anne.
I'm so sorry.

18:30.401 --> 18:33.070
I shouldn't have tried so hard
to be in control again.

18:33.070 --> 18:36.741
In the end,
where did it get me?

18:37.658 --> 18:40.036
Well, that ends now.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.080
I wanna be someone better.
Someone that deserves you.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.708
I know what I have to do.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.251
Listen up, everyone.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.587
I called you all here
to tell you that...

18:49.587 --> 18:52.381
[inhales]
...a robot army is on its way
to destroy Wartwood.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.466
[all gasp]

18:53.466 --> 18:55.468
What? An army?
How many are we talking?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.428
What's a robot?
[Sasha]
And that's not all...

18:57.428 --> 19:00.640
I lied to you
about Anne sending us
to protect the town.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.560
She's been zapped
to another world that has
no idea I'm even here.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.021
I'm no guardian.
I'm a fraud.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.105
[all gasp]

19:08.105 --> 19:10.066
Fraud or not, though,

19:10.066 --> 19:12.401
I'm gonna do the right thing
for once in my life.

19:12.401 --> 19:17.073
With my last breath
I'm gonna defend
this town.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.407
[all scream]

19:18.407 --> 19:20.493
Whoa, Nellie!

19:20.493 --> 19:22.203
Present.
Shut up, Nellie.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.792
[engines whirring]

19:27.792 --> 19:30.711
Only one? Honestly,
that doesn't seem that bad.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.054
Of course.

19:40.054 --> 19:44.100
[shouts, grunting]

19:44.100 --> 19:45.643
[screams]

19:45.643 --> 19:47.478

19:51.190 --> 19:52.191
Oh, no.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.361
[grunts]

19:59.115 --> 20:00.533
Sorry I'm late.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.701
Grime‐sy!

20:01.701 --> 20:03.160
I got to thinking,

20:03.160 --> 20:05.037
Beatrix may have weapons
and soldiers,

20:05.037 --> 20:06.789
but you know
what she doesn't have?

20:08.124 --> 20:09.458
You, Lieutenant.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.876
Grime‐sy!

20:10.876 --> 20:12.753
No. Get off me.
You big softy.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.964
<i>Increasing deployment.</i>

20:19.719 --> 20:21.637
Thirty against two, eh?

20:21.637 --> 20:22.930
Hardly a fair fight.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.390
[screaming]

20:26.934 --> 20:28.686
Die, robot scum!
[burps]

20:29.895 --> 20:31.063
Good boy.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.732
What the‐‐

20:32.732 --> 20:34.066
Oi! Bugger off.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.331
No way.
The townspeople?

20:49.331 --> 20:52.710
By barrel's belly.
They're deadlier
than any soldier.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.761
Grime!
Way ahead of you!

21:02.845 --> 21:04.430
<i>Locking on.</i>

21:08.476 --> 21:10.394
Those blasted things
are following us.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.854
Then let's lead them
in the right direction.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.747
[screams]

21:29.747 --> 21:31.707
I think you're enjoying this
too much.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.920
Wow. I don't‐‐
I don't know what to say.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.130
You said enough,
deary.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.132
You may have been
a terrible person,
Sasha,

21:40.132 --> 21:42.551
but you were honest with us
when you didn't have to be.
