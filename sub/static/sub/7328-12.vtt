WOMAN:
Hi, Mr. Poole,
my name is Julie,

00:05.173 --> 00:06.440
and I'm calling on behalf...

00:06.474 --> 00:08.276
Hi, this is Allison,
and I'd like to tell you

00:08.309 --> 00:10.278
about a special new program...

00:10.311 --> 00:11.512
Hello?

00:11.545 --> 00:13.114
Hi, Petty Officer
Lambert.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.648
Yeah?
Hi, my name is Roland Kesta.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.251
I'm calling on behalf
of Thrifty Phone Services.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.419
I've thought it over

00:18.452 --> 00:19.420
and I don't think I want

00:19.453 --> 00:21.055
to change my phone service.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.123
That's what most people say
until they hear

00:22.156 --> 00:23.591
how much we can save them
on long-distance calls.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.493
I don't make long-distance
phone calls, okay?

00:25.526 --> 00:26.494
( glass breaks )

00:26.527 --> 00:27.428
Did you hear that?

00:27.461 --> 00:28.396
What?

00:28.429 --> 00:30.131
Sounded like glass breaking
in the kitchen.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.632
No.

00:31.665 --> 00:36.270
Our long-distance service
is exactly the same as AT&T,

00:36.304 --> 00:38.472
Sprint, SBC,
except we can save you...

00:38.506 --> 00:39.540
Who the hell are you?

00:39.573 --> 00:42.476
The man who's going
to save you 40%

00:42.510 --> 00:43.577
on your long-distance calls,
sir.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.812
Get the hell out of my house!

00:44.845 --> 00:48.349
( grunting, loud crashing )

00:48.382 --> 00:49.383
Move it along.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.218
What's taking...?

00:50.251 --> 00:53.487
Um, there's
no contract to sign...

00:53.521 --> 00:57.191
( man screaming,
crashing, clattering )

00:57.225 --> 00:58.526
Uh, Petty Officer Lambert?

01:01.762 --> 01:05.466
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:05.499 --> 01:09.137
and CBS

01:42.470 --> 01:44.905
Last time I'm going
to tell you, Tony.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.474
Don't answer my phone,

01:46.507 --> 01:48.342
use my computer,
read my mail,

01:48.376 --> 01:49.543
look through
my purse,

01:49.577 --> 01:53.281
scan my PDA
or touch my cell phone ever.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.817
And an extra side
of hash browns.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.352
Just so we're clear, Kate,

01:58.386 --> 02:00.588
I didn't do any of those things.
Zero. Zip. Nada.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.889
Then how did you know

02:01.922 --> 02:03.457
where I went
to breakfast?

02:03.491 --> 02:05.293
Logo on the coffee cup
in your wastebasket.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.528
Anyone invite you into
this conversation, probie?

02:07.561 --> 02:09.363
You looked
through my trash?

02:09.397 --> 02:10.664
Did you say it was off limits?
Huh?

02:10.698 --> 02:11.665
Did ya?

02:11.699 --> 02:13.534
Why do you do these things?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.569
Sharpening
my investigative skills.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.174
Grab your gear.
What's up?

02:20.208 --> 02:21.175
A dead sailor.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.210
We didn't get any calls.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.245
Saw it on the news,
huh, boss?

02:24.278 --> 02:26.847
Hey, DiNozzo,
for once, you're right.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.350
Come on. Let's go.

02:42.796 --> 02:43.764
Who's in charge here?

02:43.797 --> 02:44.798
Lieutenant Cheney, sir.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.799
We'll finish
this in ten.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.768
Lieutenant Cheney?

02:47.801 --> 02:49.770
Special Agent
Gibbs, NCIS.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.472
CHENEY:
You must be psychic,
Gibbs.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.973
I just put in
a call to NCIS.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.508
Not psychic.
Just watch the news.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.310
They monitor our radio calls.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.546
Chief says cooperate
with the news media.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.913
Budget hearings time.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.982
You got it.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.352
What do we have here?

03:04.385 --> 03:05.152
Not sure yet.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.987
News said a sailor
was murdered.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.224
Maybe-- kitchen door's
broken in,

03:10.258 --> 03:11.992
and judging from the blood,
it could be murder.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.627
No body.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.396
No body.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.731
( both slurping )

03:17.765 --> 03:19.367
Miller.
Yeah, boss.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.670
Right away, boss.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.374
CHENEY:
We got a 911 from
a telemarketer.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.876
Said he was talking with
a Petty Officer Dion Lambert

03:28.909 --> 03:31.512
when he heard a
struggle and the
line went dead.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.447
Call was traced here.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.758
Lieutenant, your ex-wife
just called.

03:44.792 --> 03:45.826
Which one?

03:45.859 --> 03:46.960
The nasty one.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.796
You're going to have
to be more specific.

03:48.829 --> 03:49.830
This is too weird.

03:49.863 --> 03:50.964
Definitely.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.400
Good weird.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.267
You want me to call her back?

03:53.301 --> 03:54.535
No. Next time
one of my exes calls,

03:54.568 --> 03:55.536
get her name.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.271
Lieutenant.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.945
( both slurping )

04:04.978 --> 04:06.680
CHENEY/GIBBS:
Ah...

04:06.714 --> 04:09.617
CHENEY:
Unless you object,
this is yours.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.851
No objections.

04:10.884 --> 04:14.455
Let's go, Rachael.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.393
Hey, Rachael, I'm Tony.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.995
If you want
to get together
and compare notes.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.365
What's your shoe size?

04:24.398 --> 04:24.932
Twelve.

04:24.965 --> 04:25.833
( chuckles )

04:25.866 --> 04:27.435
You wish.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.736
No, it is.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.771
It really is.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.473
You can measure
it if you want.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.507
GIBBS:
DiNozzo.

04:33.541 --> 04:34.575
Yeah, boss?
Trace evidence,

04:34.608 --> 04:36.477
bag and tag.
Kate, sketch and shoot.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.879
McGee, laptop
and answering machine.

04:38.912 --> 04:39.880
Right.
( laughs )

04:39.913 --> 04:41.815
That was really odd.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.384
Hmm. What?

04:43.417 --> 04:47.287
Well, you know,
I mean, how you and him and...

04:49.390 --> 04:51.359
Never mind.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.464
Tony, have you seen
my sketch pad?

04:56.497 --> 04:57.998
Yeah, it's in the truck
under my seat.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.501
Under your seat?
How did it...?

05:04.605 --> 05:06.407
Like those pants.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.844
MAN:
Yeah, well,
that sounds good.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.413
If you can just
take care of that for me.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.781
( thud, both grunt )

05:13.814 --> 05:15.048
Oh...

05:15.082 --> 05:16.617
Sorry.
Wow!

05:16.650 --> 05:17.918
You know, your eyes

05:17.951 --> 05:19.887
are the same color
as my Porsche.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.389
( chuckles )

05:21.422 --> 05:22.122
You've gotta be kidding.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.457
( both laugh )

05:23.491 --> 05:25.092
What do you say
we have dinner?

05:25.125 --> 05:28.529
Why bother with preliminaries?

05:28.562 --> 05:30.030
Ah, now who's kidding?

05:31.499 --> 05:32.833
You serious?

05:32.866 --> 05:35.703
She's not,
but I am.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.038
CHENEY:
Come on, Monteleone.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.707
( laughs )

05:44.445 --> 05:46.380
RACHAEL:
Shotgun.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.149
Get in the car,
probie.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.686
It's deja vu.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.955
TELEMARKETER ( on tape ):
There's no contract to sign.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.858
( man screaming,
loud crashing )

05:57.891 --> 05:59.993
TELEMARKETER:
Uh, Petty Officer Lambert?

06:00.027 --> 06:03.631
( man retching, gagging )

06:03.664 --> 06:07.401
How many calls a day
do you make?

06:07.435 --> 06:08.636
Somewhere between
300 and 400.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.639
You ever feel guilty
calling people uninvited,

06:11.672 --> 06:13.474
intruding into their lives?

06:13.507 --> 06:14.675
At first, a little.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.109
When you get cursed at

06:16.143 --> 06:18.746
a couple hundred times,
you get over it.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.449
Why'd you keep selling when you
knew something was very wrong?

06:21.482 --> 06:26.153
My boss doesn't want us
to stop selling for any reason.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.755
He's got the compassion
of a cluster bomb.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.892
How did you get Petty Officer
Lambert's number?

06:31.925 --> 06:32.893
From a list broker.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.094
How'd it get on the list?

06:34.127 --> 06:35.429
I don't know.

06:35.463 --> 06:38.198
A magazine subscription,
a warranty card,

06:38.231 --> 06:40.434
supermarket charge.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.835
Supermarket charge?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.070
Why do you think

06:43.103 --> 06:44.505
they give you those
little key tags

06:44.538 --> 06:45.739
they scan when you check out?

06:45.773 --> 06:46.607
For discounts.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.443
It's to collect
information

06:49.477 --> 06:50.744
they sell to
telemarketers.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.813
What brands you buy,
how much, how often...

06:52.846 --> 06:54.448
( incredulous laugh )

06:54.482 --> 06:56.149
Isn't that
against the law?!

06:56.183 --> 06:57.150
Anytime you write

06:57.184 --> 06:57.918
your name down,

06:57.951 --> 07:00.087
it's going in
somebody's database

07:00.120 --> 07:02.022
and then being sold
to somebody else.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.524
Wow.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.226
Okay, well,
I'm going to

07:06.259 --> 07:08.195
need your work,
cell and home numbers.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.129
All right.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.832
But please don't call
between 6:00 and 8:00,

07:11.865 --> 07:14.735
because that's usually...

07:14.768 --> 07:18.171
You said 6:00 and 8:00, right?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.213
Tell Abby I want a full
acoustical analysis.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.883
Uh... uh, boss,
you-you know that

07:29.917 --> 07:31.552
she's working Petty Officer
Lambert's hard drive,

07:31.585 --> 07:32.920
answering machine and
all the crime scene evidence.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.855
Then help her, McGee.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.857
Yes, boss.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.593
You really think
it's a good idea

07:39.627 --> 07:40.794
for probie to be alone with...

07:42.896 --> 07:44.264
I was going through
Lambert's papers.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.266
Something you're
very good at.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.735
There's a second name
on the lease:

07:47.768 --> 07:49.102
George Mansur.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.639
There's no sign of a roommate
in that house, Tony.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.973
Well, roommates move out, Kate.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.642
16 months ago,
you had a roommate...

07:54.675 --> 07:55.543
Tony.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.644
Kate, you're with me.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.278
Gladly.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.580
Tony, find Mansur.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.948
On it, boss.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.599
ABBY:
The only blood type
at the scene was O-positive.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.301
Petty Officer Lambert's
O-positive.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.170
It's the most common blood type
there is.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.305
I shipped a DNA sample
to the Armed Forces Registry.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.207
Fingerprints we lifted his?

08:28.876 --> 08:31.912
Your missing corpse
is Petty Officer Lambert.

08:31.945 --> 08:32.880
Unidentified prints.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.247
I have not had time
to run all the prints

08:34.281 --> 08:35.248
that you lifted yet.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.717
Blood-spatter analysis.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.553
Okay, Gibbs, I know
you think I'm Supergirl...

08:39.587 --> 08:41.154
Actually,

08:41.188 --> 08:42.556
my hair's more like
Wonder Woman.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.824
Or Isis.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.258
Or the Powerpuff girl.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.595
I've always been
partial to Xena.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.662
I don't know
about her.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.997
No self-respecting superhero

08:50.030 --> 08:51.665
should wear
open-toed shoes.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.700
Oh, I agree.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.001
McGEE:
He erased
his hard drive.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.302
No problem.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.671
He used a DOD-certified
wipe program.

08:57.705 --> 08:58.672
Uh-oh.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.140
"Uh-oh" doesn't sound good.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.141
It's not.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.776
A DOD wipe not
only deletes,

09:02.810 --> 09:04.612
but it overwrites
seven times.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.279
There's no way to recapture
the information, boss.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.582
Why would he use
something like that
on his home computer?

09:08.616 --> 09:10.250
He's an information
systems tech,

09:10.283 --> 09:12.586
and it could just be
a matter of course,
or he could be...

09:12.620 --> 09:13.687
Hiding something.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.624
He wipe his answering machine?

09:16.657 --> 09:18.792
No. There were
two calls.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.028
One yesterday,
from Blockbuster Video--

09:21.061 --> 09:23.230
late returning
Happy Gilmore--

09:23.263 --> 09:25.365
and one two days ago from
Thrifty Phone Services.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.200
All right,
let's hear it.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.335
You!

09:28.368 --> 09:29.737
Blood spatters!

09:31.271 --> 09:35.175
ABBY:
* Yo-ho, heave ho...

09:35.208 --> 09:38.746
Petty Officer Lambert,
my name is Dennis Brough.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.814
I'm calling on behalf
of Thrifty Phone Services.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.050
How would you
like to cut... ( beep )

09:43.083 --> 09:44.251
That's it?

09:44.284 --> 09:45.318
He must've picked up.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.155
They called him two days ago,
why call him back?

09:48.188 --> 09:50.023
Dennis Brough, Kate.

09:50.057 --> 09:50.824
Got it.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.159
Acoustics analysis.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.161
Yes.
On that next, boss.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.120
( computer beeps )

10:21.454 --> 10:23.090
( computers blipping )

10:26.393 --> 10:28.696
( rapid blipping )

10:31.765 --> 10:32.833
( three blips )

10:34.467 --> 10:37.404
Who was that that said,
"Always expect the unexpected"?

10:37.437 --> 10:38.772
Me.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.407
Well, you're right again.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.508
Boss, you sure are.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.944
McGee, you're about
to interrupt unbelievable news.

10:43.977 --> 10:44.778
Abby, trust me,

10:44.812 --> 10:46.947
my news is much more
unbelievable.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.048
Gibbs, you're never going
to believe what I found.

10:48.081 --> 10:48.816
Kate, hold on
one second.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.884
( all talking at once )

10:50.918 --> 10:52.285
McGEE:
Hold on, okay?

10:52.319 --> 10:53.787
This is really
important!

10:53.821 --> 10:55.088
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

10:55.122 --> 10:56.824
McGEE:
You just walked in and...

10:56.857 --> 10:59.226
( whistles ) Hey!

10:59.259 --> 11:00.694
Abby.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.796
Okay, this is the blood trail

11:02.830 --> 11:06.700
found on Petty Officer Lambert's
kitchen floor.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.468
Notice anything hinky?

11:08.501 --> 11:09.469
Yeah, they're passive drops.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.470
Exactly.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.006
Created by the force of gravity
acting alone.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.342
In blood trails,
the shape of drops

11:15.375 --> 11:16.443
are affected by gravity
and movement.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.346
The tail always points
in the direction of travel.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.349
There was no movement
when the blood dropped.

11:22.382 --> 11:26.353
Nope. Somebody stood there,
dropped some blood,

11:26.386 --> 11:28.388
took a step,
dropped some blood...

11:28.421 --> 11:30.023
took a step,
dropped some blood...

11:30.057 --> 11:31.491
McGee!

11:31.524 --> 11:34.127
The acoustical analysis
of the phone call

11:34.161 --> 11:37.364
indicates that the fight sounds
were unidirectional.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.500
I overlaid Kate's sketch
of the crime scene

11:40.533 --> 11:42.335
and found the source

11:42.369 --> 11:43.737
to be Petty Officer
Lambert's computer.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.839
They were sound
effects, boss.

11:45.873 --> 11:46.840
Okay.

11:46.874 --> 11:47.775
Kate.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.876
I spoke to Dennis Brough

11:48.909 --> 11:50.310
from the Thrifty
Phone Service.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.012
He's home with the flu.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.782
The supervisor gave Dennis
his lead to Roland Kesta.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.384
Petty Officer Lambert
asked that telemarketer

11:57.417 --> 11:58.451
to call him back.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.221
Between 8:00 and 12:00
last night.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.426
Our petty officer
faked his own murder.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.834
We have one advantage
over Petty Officer Lambert:

12:13.867 --> 12:16.336
he doesn't know
we know he's still alive.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.205
I'll flag his accounts:

12:18.238 --> 12:19.072
bank, credit, ATM, E-mail.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.074
Kate, this mojo faked
his own death.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.911
Left his laptop, wallet,
cell phone and car behind.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.545
Do you really think
he's going to swipe

12:25.578 --> 12:27.214
the old charge card
at the local Drugs R' Us?

12:30.117 --> 12:31.284
Tony's right.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.352
Thanks, boss.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.486
( no audio )

12:33.520 --> 12:35.055
GIBBS:
You check it anyway, Kate.
You never know.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.224
If Tony ever does find
his ex-roomie,

12:37.257 --> 12:39.059
check his
accounts, too.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.493
I'm zoning in on him.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.394
Yeah? You locate him?

12:41.428 --> 12:44.497
Not yet, but... got
his driver's license.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.468
Federal tax return, too.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.137
He's a freelance
computer geek.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.339
Made six figures last year.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.241
Wishing you were
a computer geek, Tony?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.810
I'd rather be homeless
than be you, probie.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.983
It's an old address;
same as Petty Officer Lambert's.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.085
He's depreciating a '93 Hyundai
on his return.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.287
How can you depreciate a car
that old?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.856
More important question:

13:08.889 --> 13:10.457
Why would a guy pulling down
six figures a year

13:10.490 --> 13:11.524
drive a car that old?

13:11.558 --> 13:13.426
Only one way to find out.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.896
Find him and ask him.
Which I am trying...

13:16.930 --> 13:18.832
...going to do.

13:18.866 --> 13:19.833
McGee, you're with me.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.905
Where we going, boss?

13:24.938 --> 13:27.174
Talk to Petty Officer
Lambert's shipmates.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.476
But he's not
on a ship, boss.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.514
Oh, sir, you were using
a military euphemism.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.582
You think?

13:35.615 --> 13:36.984
So, uh,

13:37.017 --> 13:40.053
you mean Bethesda Hospital
Computer Center.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.554
You speak their language.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.024
You mean, I'm going
to interview them?

13:44.057 --> 13:45.358
I interview.
You translate.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.826
Come on.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.132
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Lieutenant Barclay
to Admin 24.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.433
Lieutenant Barclay to Admin 24.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.902
MAN:
Lambert's UA for one day,

13:54.935 --> 13:57.237
NCIS is investigating?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.139
You have a problem with that,
Petty Officer Wilson?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.273
No, sir.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.442
What was Petty Officer
Lambert's job?

14:02.475 --> 14:05.412
He was developing
a new code base

14:05.445 --> 14:07.280
for enterprise resource
and planning.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.216
The new application will be able
to support

14:09.249 --> 14:11.284
medical multi-processing
and scalable architecture

14:11.318 --> 14:13.120
up to eight terabytes
of data.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.221
Wow.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.989
Whew.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.926
He was writing
a new computer program

14:18.959 --> 14:21.228
as part of an overhaul
and update

14:21.261 --> 14:23.630
to the Naval Medical
Computer System.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.166
Hmm. Anything sensitive?

14:26.199 --> 14:29.202
A person's health information
is very sensitive, sir.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.504
National security sensitive,
Petty Officer.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.306
We have a circuit-based gateway,
sir,

14:33.340 --> 14:35.208
which applies
a security mechanism

14:35.242 --> 14:38.045
anytime there's a USD-TCP
connection established.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.147
Once that
connection's made,

14:40.180 --> 14:41.414
packets can travel
between hosts

14:41.448 --> 14:43.416
without further checking.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.052
No.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.921
Petty Officer
Lambert's fitreps

14:47.955 --> 14:49.356
were above standard, sir.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.424
He was just
a regular guy.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.927
Our definition of "regular"
might be different.

14:55.195 --> 14:58.198
One man's Linux
is another's OS/2.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.299
( laughs )

14:59.332 --> 15:00.700
I hear that.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.568
Right.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.137
Sorry.

15:04.171 --> 15:07.374
Any recent changes
in his behavior
or attitude?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.441
No, sir.

15:08.475 --> 15:09.977
Take that back.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.612
A few days ago,
he seemed jumpy.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.081
I tapped him on the shoulder

15:14.114 --> 15:15.983
to talk about
the performance degradation

15:16.016 --> 15:17.017
in the application gateway,

15:17.050 --> 15:18.351
and he about came out
of his chair.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.221
He was... nervous.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.991
Yeah, I got that, McGee.

15:24.024 --> 15:24.958
Okay.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.126
Yeah, I'm going to need,

15:26.159 --> 15:28.228
I'm going to need
copies of all his stuff.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.264
Uh, access to
the source codes,

15:31.298 --> 15:34.067
flow charts, and the
logical processes

15:34.101 --> 15:35.335
involved in the application.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.369
Not a problem, sir.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.239
Special Agent Gibbs.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.540
Karen Wilkerson,

15:40.573 --> 15:43.143
Petty Officer Wilson's
supervisor.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.712
You're late.

15:45.745 --> 15:49.716
We're making
a software changeover.
It's been crazy.

15:49.749 --> 15:50.950
Mm.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.424
Get copies of what
we need here, McGee.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.558
Right, boss.

15:58.591 --> 16:02.262
Tell me about
Petty Officer Lambert.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.631
Not a lot to tell.

16:04.664 --> 16:05.532
Good guy.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.767
Hard worker.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.336
First one in
in the mornings,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.004
usually the last to leave.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.740
Volunteered
to work weekends.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.775
You work weekends?

16:15.808 --> 16:19.246
Not if I can help it.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.514
Why is NCIS
investigating a sailor

16:21.548 --> 16:23.416
who's missed one day
of work?

16:23.450 --> 16:25.218
He's UA,
Miss Wilkerson.

16:25.252 --> 16:28.021
It's not as if
he's missed a deployment.

16:28.055 --> 16:32.392
Petty Officer Wilson says
he seemed jumpy lately.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.362
Well, he'd be in
a better position
to know that than me.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.766
Petty Officer Lambert
and I didn't have much
day-to-day contact.

16:39.799 --> 16:44.737
You, uh, work weekends,

16:44.771 --> 16:47.607
Special Agent Gibbs?

16:49.176 --> 16:50.310
If I need to.

16:50.343 --> 16:55.282
Why do I feel
you need to a lot?

16:55.315 --> 16:58.218
( laughs )

16:59.186 --> 17:00.687
Anything else?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.822
I have to get back to work.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.225
Not at the moment.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.228
Well, if there is,

17:08.261 --> 17:10.497
I'll make myself
available.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.201
Even on the weekend.

17:17.437 --> 17:20.307
Oh, might even be on time.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.612
( chuckles )

17:25.645 --> 17:26.579
Wow.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.580
KATE:
Enough, Tony.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.082
I have nothing to hide.

17:29.116 --> 17:29.916
Really? Hmm.

17:29.949 --> 17:32.585
For someone
with nothing to hide,

17:32.619 --> 17:33.453
you seem
awfully concerned

17:33.486 --> 17:34.854
about what other people
know about you.

17:34.887 --> 17:35.822
Why, because I get upset

17:35.855 --> 17:37.857
when you go through
my personal belongings?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.326
Exactly.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.593
Well, Tony,

17:40.627 --> 17:44.397
some people enjoy having
a private life.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.200
Unlike you, we
don't go around
informing everyone

17:47.234 --> 17:49.869
about the frequency
of our hooking up.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.471
In a slump?

17:53.406 --> 17:54.541
( weary sigh )

17:55.675 --> 17:57.677
Gibbs-- Mansur
withdrew $6,000

17:57.710 --> 17:59.646
from his bank account

17:59.679 --> 18:02.249
the week before
he moved out.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.683
He's also moved three times
in the last six years.

18:03.716 --> 18:07.520
This last time he didn't file
a change of address

18:07.554 --> 18:08.588
at the post office.
Thank you.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.790
Whatever the hell this is,
they're in it together.

18:10.823 --> 18:14.561
Yeah, but what is...
"whatever the hell this is"?

18:14.594 --> 18:15.828
Find Mansur...

18:15.862 --> 18:17.530
Yes.
And we'll find out.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.698
I know, boss. I'm trying.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.333
Try harder.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.768
Right.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.503
You know, Gibbs,
maybe Lambert

18:23.536 --> 18:25.405
faked his own death
to get out the Navy.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.175
You know, wanted
to make a few bucks,
like his roomie.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.041
Not likely.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.610
His enlistment was up
in five months.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.912
McGee!
Yeah, boss.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.581
Check with Abby.
Find out how she's doing

18:34.614 --> 18:35.482
with that stuff
you brought in.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.716
Right.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.654
( yawns )

18:43.356 --> 18:45.458
That should help
keep you awake.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.593
Thanks.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.631
I have looked at
100,000 lines of code.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.434
Is it possible to die
of boredom?

18:54.467 --> 18:55.602
No.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.571
How can you be sure?

18:58.605 --> 19:03.510
Well, because I had Professor
Bernbaum for economics.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.577
Believe me,

19:04.611 --> 19:07.280
his class makes staring
at a monitor

19:07.314 --> 19:08.581
seem like Mardi Gras.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.317
I don't know.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.385
This really sucks.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.920
I'll tell you
what sucks.

19:13.953 --> 19:17.624
Working after school
as a burnt-potato-chip picker.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.526
You're making that up.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.861
You ever seen
a burnt potato chip

19:21.894 --> 19:23.763
in a bag
of potato chips?

19:23.796 --> 19:26.566
Hmm. Now that you mention it.

19:26.599 --> 19:30.403
Sat next to a conveyer belt,
air choked with oil,

19:30.437 --> 19:33.806
watching cooked potato chips
fly by.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.408
I would pick out the burnt ones

19:35.442 --> 19:36.976
while trying
not to get motion sickness.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.547
Incinerator operator.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.915
Burning medical waste
at 2,000 degrees.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.617
Body parts, body waste.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.622
Summer between freshman
and sophomore year,

19:49.656 --> 19:51.424
I was a Porta Potti cleaner.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.560
It was the hottest summer
on record.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.563
Ski-lift operator-- Alberta.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.231
Negative 44 degrees Fahrenheit.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.899
Cleaned asbestos.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.569
Collected roadkill.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.337
Tie?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.472
No? Okay.

20:05.505 --> 20:09.542
( computer beeping )
Before I joined NCIS...

20:09.576 --> 20:12.412
Is that what
I think it is?

20:15.715 --> 20:18.385
Depends.
What do you think it is?

20:19.519 --> 20:23.723
The reason Petty Officer Lambert
faked his own murder.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.897
Petty Officer Lambert
was part of the team

20:30.930 --> 20:33.733
that was updating the Navy's
medical computer system.

20:33.766 --> 20:34.867
He'd been working on it
almost two years.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.703
Did you tell him?

20:36.736 --> 20:37.837
No. Saved the best for you.

20:37.870 --> 20:38.705
Oh, thanks, McGee.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.273
You know how I relish
the moments...

20:40.307 --> 20:42.375
Stop relishing and
start explaining, Abby.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.444
Okay. Geez, Gibbs.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.912
Five months ago,
Petty Officer Lambert

20:45.945 --> 20:48.348
buried a simple command
in the program

20:48.381 --> 20:49.482
to send him drugs.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.383
Lots of drugs.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.384
McGee!
Sorry.

20:51.418 --> 20:55.622
For every 337 prescriptions,

20:55.655 --> 20:56.823
one was written for him.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.658
It's ingenious
in its simplicity.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.692
What kind of drugs?

20:59.726 --> 21:00.827
Painkillers:

21:00.860 --> 21:02.962
Percocet, Vicodin, Oxycontin.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.665
Oxycontin is twice
as addictive as heroin.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.934
It's more addictive
than pistachios.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.705
Well, have you ever eaten
just one pistachio?

21:12.739 --> 21:13.906
Actually, I have.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.642
Uh, potato chips,
on the other hand...

21:18.711 --> 21:22.782
Uh, uh, the Navy writes
a lot of prescriptions,

21:22.815 --> 21:24.351
so the amount
that he was getting,

21:24.384 --> 21:25.652
it's no way it was
for personal use.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.721
In the last five months,
18,000 Oxycontin,

21:28.755 --> 21:30.890
12,000 Percocet,
9,000 Vicodin.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.360
Legal price for an
80-milligram Oxycontin:

21:33.393 --> 21:34.561
six dollars.

21:34.594 --> 21:35.562
Street price is
$65 to $80.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.698
On the Oxycontin alone,
he made a million bucks.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.666
Cash.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.436
Petty Officer Lambert
is long gone.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.672
I would be.

21:53.780 --> 21:56.983
Three lines of computer code
buried among millions.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.888
I'm amazed you found it.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.757
I didn't, really.
It was Abby Sciuto.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.058
She's a whiz at codes.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.960
You never suspected
Petty Officer Lambert

22:07.994 --> 22:10.630
of abusing his access
to the Navy drug system?

22:10.663 --> 22:12.632
Not until you showed up.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.567
When NCIS investigates

22:14.601 --> 22:18.471
a sailor who's been UA one day,
there's something wrong.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.540
After you left,
I had Petty Officer Wilson

22:20.573 --> 22:22.409
run a check
on Lambert's computer.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.676
I never caught this.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.578
Sciuto must be hot!

22:27.514 --> 22:31.050
What made you suspicious,
Agent Gibbs?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.919
A murder that didn't happen.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.122
Your Petty Officer
faked his own death.

22:36.155 --> 22:39.158
He wanted us looking for
his body instead of him.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.061
We'd have done it, too,
if Abby hadn't found
the hinky blood trail.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.530
( laughs )

22:43.563 --> 22:44.931
I gotta meet this woman.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.502
You know what, she's
probably not your type--

22:49.536 --> 22:51.471
tats, piercings,
dark makeup...

22:51.504 --> 22:52.872
Goth?

22:52.905 --> 22:53.806
Yeah.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.107
I love Goth.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.610
GIBBS:
Thieves are just like
gamblers.

22:57.644 --> 23:00.913
They never quit when
they're ahead.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.549
Why would Petty Officer Lambert?

23:02.582 --> 23:07.520
In five days, the new software
system goes online.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.689
He must've been afraid it would
pick up his scam.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.190
WILSON:
Got it.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.660
He had this prescription
sent to Box 781,

23:13.693 --> 23:16.596
Mail Boxes Etc,
Fourteenth Street.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.598
McGee, you two keep pulling
Lambert's scrips.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.100
See if there are any
in the pipeline.
Happy to, boss.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.202
Lieutenant Cheney.
Special Agent Gibbs.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.771
WOMAN:
One moment.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.842
So tell me more
about this Abby.

23:29.876 --> 23:34.581
You know what? I can't
work and talk... okay?

23:36.015 --> 23:37.617
Think you'll find him?

23:37.650 --> 23:39.586
Usually do.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.753
Hello.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.154
Hey, Cheney.
It's Gibbs.

23:42.188 --> 23:42.955
What do you got?

23:42.989 --> 23:44.023
Our missing Petty Officer
siphoned

23:44.056 --> 23:46.826
thousands of opiates from
the Navy drug program.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.227
Ring any bells?

23:48.260 --> 23:49.128
Oh, yeah.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.463
Where and when?

23:50.497 --> 23:52.064
My office. One hour.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.099
You got it.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.903
You like boats?

23:56.936 --> 23:59.005
Sail or power?

23:59.038 --> 24:01.774
Sail.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.944
I love to sail.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.113
This weekend?

24:07.146 --> 24:09.616
Um... I'm...

24:09.649 --> 24:11.851
I'm still building her.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.521
Which marina?

24:14.554 --> 24:15.655
My basement.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.890
( laughing ):
Of course.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.794
Saturday?

24:21.828 --> 24:25.598
If I can find Lambert by then.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.901
Well... what are you doing
standing here, Agent Gibbs?

24:35.675 --> 24:36.943
Jethro.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.745
Jethro?!

24:47.854 --> 24:49.789
McGEE:
Two black coffees.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.160
And two grande triple-pump

24:54.193 --> 24:56.162
half-caf vanilla lattes.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.997
Cheers.
Thanks.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.600
Mine's the one
with the extra foam.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.802
McGEE:
Ah! Ah! Sorry.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.140
So, Gibbs, I've had my eye
on this one guy--

25:08.174 --> 25:11.310
he's a lobbyist--
went from dealing

25:11.343 --> 25:13.312
to a few friends
to supplying the beltway

25:13.345 --> 25:14.881
with illegal painkillers.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.315
Well, syncs up.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.817
Miller.

25:17.850 --> 25:18.851
Yeah, boss.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.088
Just a second.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.790
You know what?
Here, let me....

25:23.823 --> 25:24.724
Ooh!
Ooh!

25:24.757 --> 25:25.725
My fault.

25:25.758 --> 25:26.859
No, it was mine.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.728
No, I should've been
more careful.

25:28.761 --> 25:29.829
No, not a problem.
Not a problem.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.764
McGee! Miller!

25:31.798 --> 25:33.232
BOTH:
Sorry, boss.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.840
Aaron Alan Wright.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.041
Ever busted?

25:42.074 --> 25:42.975
Once.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.811
Dealing to his frat brothers
at Syracuse.

25:44.844 --> 25:45.845
Got probation.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.213
Why haven't you busted him?

25:47.246 --> 25:49.081
I want the other end
of his pipeline.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.151
I bust him, his supplier
just finds another dealer.

25:52.184 --> 25:53.686
He's soft.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.987
Mind bringing him in here
for a chat?

25:55.021 --> 25:56.188
Oh, yeah.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.926
Have Monteleone and Rand
pick up Wright.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.093
Deliver him here.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.795
Sure, boss.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.233
Is that the 7220?

26:07.266 --> 26:08.801
That's the 7230.

26:08.835 --> 26:09.869
Sweet.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.237
Yeah.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.911
GIBBS:
Petty Officer
Dion Lambert.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.747
Sorry.
Never heard of him.

26:20.780 --> 26:24.784
A Navy computer geek.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.819
Steals painkillers
from the government.

26:26.853 --> 26:30.890
What does a swabbie stealing
painkillers have to do with me?

26:30.923 --> 26:31.758
He sells them to you,

26:31.791 --> 26:34.126
you sell them
to your beltway clients.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.895
This really is a waste of time.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.664
( over speaker ):
I've advised my client

26:37.697 --> 26:40.833
not to answer your questions,
and he won't.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.001
That is beautiful.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.671
Franck Muller
Conquistadore.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.739
MONTELEONE:
$7,800 retail.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.941
Yeah; you know that guy
paid retail.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.977
Look at him.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.880
We've known you've been
dealing for months.

26:53.913 --> 26:54.814
WRIGHT:
Really.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.816
Then, uh, why'd it take you

26:56.849 --> 26:58.217
this long to call me in?

26:58.250 --> 27:00.653
The lieutenant wanted
your source.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.054
And I just
gave it to him.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.090
And that's the Petty Officer?
What was his name again?

27:04.123 --> 27:06.659
Dion Lambert.

27:06.693 --> 27:07.660
( annoyed sigh )

27:07.694 --> 27:08.961
I'm scanning...

27:08.995 --> 27:10.930
No. No hits.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.833
This isn't a frat bust
for grass, Aaron.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.868
This is hard time.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.169
Every night...

27:17.203 --> 27:19.839
hard time.

27:19.872 --> 27:23.810
CHENEY:
Tell us where Petty Officer
Lambert's hiding.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.244
We'll cut you a deal.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.847
Minimum time in
a Federal facility

27:27.880 --> 27:30.116
without nightly cavity searches.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.986
Aaron, if they had
evidence of you doing
something illegal--

27:34.020 --> 27:38.825
which I know you didn't--
they wouldn't be talking deals.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.827
I have to listen
to my lawyer.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.094
He's very expensive.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.430
When I find
Petty Officer Lambert...

27:44.463 --> 27:45.898
And he will.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.800
...he'll roll on you for a deal.

27:47.834 --> 27:48.935
Really?
Yeah.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.937
You want to know why?

27:50.970 --> 27:53.706
( half-whispers ):
'Cause he's soft.

27:53.740 --> 27:54.974
Just like you.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.809
What is this?

27:56.843 --> 27:58.377
"Bad Cop, Bad Cop"?

27:58.410 --> 27:59.912
Gibbs, we miscalculated.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.347
You think?

28:01.380 --> 28:03.750
Our friend here's
looking forward

28:03.783 --> 28:07.353
to playing strip poker
in Marion-- without cards.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.822
GIBBS:
Yeah? Is that true...

28:09.856 --> 28:11.090
Air-ron?

28:13.826 --> 28:16.228
Charge my client
or we're walking out.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.997
Now.

28:25.905 --> 28:26.939
Bastards.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.041
GIBBS:
Aaron?

28:30.209 --> 28:31.978
You won't last 48 hours
at Marion.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.412
Oh, I figure 24.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.414
Five bucks.

28:35.447 --> 28:36.883
That's a bet.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.954
( chuckling )

28:41.988 --> 28:43.890
What are you laughing at,
DiNozzo?

28:45.191 --> 28:47.059
And you, Monteleone?

28:48.394 --> 28:50.062
We didn't break him!

28:51.497 --> 28:52.999
Made him piss
his pants, though.

28:53.032 --> 28:56.068
( chuckles ):
Hell, yes.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.345
I'd wait until
we get outside.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.183
Aaron...

29:17.289 --> 29:18.991
( rolling the "r" ):
Rachael...

29:19.025 --> 29:20.526
Hey, how would you like
to discuss

29:20.559 --> 29:22.294
that interrogation
over some...

29:22.328 --> 29:24.063
Chinese food?
I don't think so.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.933
Yeah, how'd you know
I was going to...?
Kate said you would.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.969
Well, you see,
Kate's just a little...
Jealous?

29:30.002 --> 29:32.571
Did she tell you I was
going to say that, too?

29:32.604 --> 29:34.974
I'll give you one thing.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.076
You're almost as
good-looking as...

29:37.109 --> 29:39.211
you think you are.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.421
Gibbs! George Mansur--
Lambert's ex-roommate--

29:49.455 --> 29:51.891
he's online!

29:51.924 --> 29:53.559
Where?
I back-traced
his I.P. address

29:53.592 --> 29:55.995
to the Key Bridge
Cybercafe in Georgetown.

29:56.028 --> 29:59.398
Tony, McGee, you're with me.
Kate, phones.

29:59.431 --> 30:02.368
Abby, keep tabs on
Mansur's computer.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.104
But...

30:05.137 --> 30:06.205
( sighs )

30:06.238 --> 30:07.539
Boys night out!

30:07.573 --> 30:09.141
Which means girls night in!

30:09.175 --> 30:11.310
Transfer your
phones to my lab.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.087
Look, this is illegal!
Your guy is on my computer!

30:21.120 --> 30:23.089
TONY:
It's not your computer.
It's the cybercafe's.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.090
Yeah, well,
I'm logged in on it!

30:24.123 --> 30:25.257
He can see all of my trades.

30:25.291 --> 30:28.260
That's an invasion
of my privacy!

30:28.294 --> 30:30.562
Actually, he's right, boss.

30:30.596 --> 30:31.964
Uh-huh.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.934
Then... you'll let me go?

30:34.967 --> 30:36.035
No.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.403
( screaming ):
Hel...!

30:37.436 --> 30:39.838
Don't... shout.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.408
Federal Agents.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.076
All's well.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.011
Go about your business.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.246
Where's your roomie?

30:47.279 --> 30:48.881
I-I don't have one.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.017
Ex-roomie.
Dion?

30:51.050 --> 30:53.619
I don't know. I haven't
seen him since I moved
out two weeks ago.

30:53.652 --> 30:54.720
Why'd you move?

30:54.753 --> 30:58.057
He bought the place.
Didn't want a roommate anymore.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.658
You didn't file
a change of address.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.093
I-I mailed it
in yesterday.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.428
You and Dion partners?

31:02.461 --> 31:04.596
No. He-he works his own trades.

31:04.630 --> 31:08.134
A Petty Officer Second
day trades in the market?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.568
Dion's sharp.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.204
Is that what this is about?
His inside trading?

31:12.238 --> 31:13.639
Inside trading?
Had to be.

31:13.672 --> 31:16.342
He makes a lot more money
than I do in the market.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.044
The drug market?

31:18.077 --> 31:19.912
Dion wasn't dealing drugs.

31:19.946 --> 31:21.013
I'd have known.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.148
Uh-huh.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.284
Well, if he was,
I didn't know, I swear!

31:25.317 --> 31:26.285
Where's Dion now?

31:26.318 --> 31:27.353
I don't know!

31:27.386 --> 31:28.587
He's a workaholic.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.057
If he's not home,
he's at his job.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.258
( cell phone rings )

31:32.291 --> 31:34.326
Yeah. Gibbs.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.063
CHENEY:
I've got good news
and I've got bad news, Gibbs.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.598
This is your car, right?
Okay...

31:39.631 --> 31:42.534
You make a couple hundred grand
a year and you drive this?

31:42.568 --> 31:44.403
I'm not a... car guy.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.338
Don't you dig chicks?

31:46.372 --> 31:48.340
Right. Got it.

31:48.374 --> 31:51.677
Get McGee and Abby
to do what they do
when they hook up.

31:51.710 --> 31:52.979
( chuckles )

31:53.012 --> 31:55.114
You meant their computers.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.415
Then you take him in.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.684
Well, I haven't done...
Shut up!

31:58.717 --> 31:59.685
So, what's up?

31:59.718 --> 32:04.123
Lieutenant Cheney found
Petty Officer Lambert.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.058
Where?

32:06.092 --> 32:09.928
In a ravine
in Rock Creek Park.

32:12.231 --> 32:15.201
( indistinct police
radio communications )

32:29.415 --> 32:33.085
DUCKY:
This the petty officer
who faked his murder, Jethro?

32:34.286 --> 32:37.056
Unless DNA says otherwise.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.060
Yeah, well,
he's not faking now.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.195
Shooter put
one round

32:43.229 --> 32:45.097
into the back of his head.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.232
DUCKY:
And his hair is burned.

32:46.265 --> 32:50.669
I'd say the muzzle was within
two inches of his skull.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.104
Aaron Wright
doesn't have the guts

32:52.138 --> 32:53.739
to pull a trigger
looking you in the eyes.

32:53.772 --> 32:56.508
Neither does George Mansur,

32:56.542 --> 32:58.377
but my gut's telling me

32:58.410 --> 33:00.746
that Ducky's about
to eliminate him as a suspect.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.348
What time did
our boy die, Duck?

33:02.381 --> 33:04.283
Patience, Jethro.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.052
Mr. Palmer is at home

33:06.085 --> 33:08.554
with the flu, so I'm
my own assistant tonight.

33:08.587 --> 33:11.757
Yeah.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.293
Judging
by the ambient temperature,

33:14.326 --> 33:15.661
I'd say he expired

33:15.694 --> 33:18.730
between 1800 and 2100 hours.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.267
How does that jibe
with your gut?

33:21.300 --> 33:25.237
Well... let us see.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.039
Oh, wow.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.807
Mansur bought
Argente Cosmetics

33:28.840 --> 33:31.410
two days before it jumped
28 points.

33:31.443 --> 33:34.080
Must have been when the FDA
approved androgen lipstick.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.715
It increases a woman's libido.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.220
Viagra for women?

33:41.253 --> 33:44.123
Why is that funny, McGee?

33:44.156 --> 33:45.257
It's not that it's funny.

33:45.291 --> 33:47.426
It's, it's, you know, women.

33:47.459 --> 33:48.727
Women...

33:48.760 --> 33:49.795
don't need to
be turned on

33:49.828 --> 33:52.798
before they perform?

33:52.831 --> 33:55.701
No, no, that's not
what I mean, Abby.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.136
( phone rings )

33:57.169 --> 33:58.137
What?!

33:58.170 --> 33:59.671
Whoa!

33:59.705 --> 34:01.173
Yikes, Abby.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.574
What did McGee do this time?

34:02.608 --> 34:05.277
He put his size ten shoe

34:05.311 --> 34:06.578
in his size 12 mouth.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.380
GIBBS:
When did Mansur log on

34:08.414 --> 34:10.048
at the cyber cafe?

34:10.849 --> 34:12.851
16:56.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.087
Four minutes before
the Tokyo market opened.

34:15.121 --> 34:18.157
The longest trading gap
was eight minutes

34:18.190 --> 34:19.825
until Neander-boy took over.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.460
When you're done
with Neander-boy,

34:21.493 --> 34:23.262
tell him to release Mansur.

34:23.295 --> 34:26.265
That might be a while, Gibbs.

34:28.334 --> 34:30.236
MONTELEONE:
Oh, no, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

34:30.269 --> 34:31.036
No, no, no, no, no.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.704
I've never paid
for it in my life.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.473
Uh-huh.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.242
Well, I was 15

34:36.275 --> 34:37.176
and my cousin Anzo

34:37.209 --> 34:39.311
paid Maggie O'Brian
for the both of us,

34:39.345 --> 34:39.778
but that doesn't count.

34:39.811 --> 34:40.879
Yes it does, Tony.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.181
I'm Primo.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.384
Sorry. Couldn't tell
the two of you apart.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.522
Look at this.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.160
Someone's been
chain smoking here.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.164
Do you smoke, Aaron?

34:58.197 --> 34:59.431
All right,
you got me, all right?

34:59.465 --> 35:01.800
I lit up in your elevator.
What's the big...?

35:01.833 --> 35:03.369
Oh, geez.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.803
How's it going, Ducky?

35:04.836 --> 35:06.705
Slow, with no assistant.

35:06.738 --> 35:07.706
This the killer?

35:07.739 --> 35:08.740
I didn't kill anybody.

35:08.774 --> 35:09.875
I don't even own a gun.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.577
You want to see
what your bullet did?

35:11.610 --> 35:13.179
No.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.913
Did Aaron just
acknowledge
he shot him?

35:14.946 --> 35:16.315
Sounded that way to me.

35:16.348 --> 35:17.383
No. I don't want to see this.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.751
I can assure you,
it will be very instructional.

35:19.785 --> 35:23.522
Your slug penetrated
the occipital lobe,

35:23.555 --> 35:25.457
instantly blinding
the poor boy.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.326
Death, of course,
was so sudden,

35:27.359 --> 35:28.594
I doubt that
he'd notice it.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.761
It then

35:29.795 --> 35:31.263
entered the corpus callosum.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.232
Oh, God, just stop.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.166
I gotta barf.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.236
During the 18th century,
the corpus callosum

35:37.269 --> 35:38.370
was believed
to house the soul.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.706
It wasn't till the
mid-20th century

35:40.739 --> 35:42.508
that scientists determined

35:42.541 --> 35:44.676
that it's a thick
bundle of nerve fibers

35:44.710 --> 35:47.879
to transfer information
between the right and left

35:47.913 --> 35:50.216
hemispheres
of the brain.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.185
Fascinating.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.554
I didn't kill Dion.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.256
Dion?

35:57.289 --> 35:59.625
Definitely someone he was
on a first-name basis with.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.397
Is that deal you offered
still on the table?

36:05.431 --> 36:07.366
Hell, no.

36:08.434 --> 36:09.601
I know who killed him.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.807
Do I get the deal?

36:15.841 --> 36:17.709
Not if it was you.

36:19.945 --> 36:20.879
I can live with that.

36:22.548 --> 36:25.684
I picked up the drugs
from a blind mailbox.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.587
I sent the cash
by return mail.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.656
The last shipment
came in two days ago.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.558
I dropped 50 grand in
the mail that night.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.260
He made a million
and got whacked

36:34.293 --> 36:35.494
waiting for 50 grand.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.729
You cops always inflate.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.265
They never made
anywhere near a mil.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.266
They?

36:40.299 --> 36:41.267
Dion and his partner.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.268
CHENEY:
What partner?

36:42.301 --> 36:44.403
I don't know his name.
I only worked with Dion.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.404
Hey, wait-wait.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.374
Just... hear me out. Please.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.245
Sorry.
His partner is a...

36:53.279 --> 36:55.481
a computer geek
where Dion works.

36:55.514 --> 36:56.415
He picked up on the scam

36:56.448 --> 36:58.384
and he threatened
to report it unless Dion

36:58.417 --> 36:59.651
cut him in on half.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.487
Find the partner...

37:01.520 --> 37:03.255
you find his killer.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.825
WILKERSON:
I don't believe him.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.494
If two of my people
were ripping off

37:08.527 --> 37:10.762
the system, I should be
fired for incompetence.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.431
They weren't
both doing it.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.633
Petty Officer Wilson
caught on to the scam.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.702
Well, if he caught
on, I should have.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.371
They sat next
to each other.

37:19.405 --> 37:22.374
You're not very
computer-literate are you,
Jethro?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.875
McGEE:
Boss?

37:23.909 --> 37:24.976
He's got
a Trojan horse

37:25.010 --> 37:27.346
on Petty Officer
Lambert's computer.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.381
He could access his programs.

37:29.415 --> 37:30.349
I didn't insert that.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.483
Just once, boss,

37:31.517 --> 37:33.452
I wish one of
these guys would say

37:33.485 --> 37:35.321
"You got me."

37:35.354 --> 37:36.588
"I did it."

37:36.622 --> 37:37.589
McGee.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.291
Sorry, man.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.459
Ma'am, you know me.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.760
I love the Navy.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.395
I wouldn't steal from it.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.996
I believe you, Niles.

38:06.352 --> 38:07.519
How could I have
missed this yesterday?

38:08.454 --> 38:09.655
Nobody gets everything right

38:09.688 --> 38:10.722
the first time, McGee...

38:10.756 --> 38:12.424
except Gibbs.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.492
I just can't believe
that Niles did it.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.761
McGee, you're so...

38:15.794 --> 38:16.995
trusting.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.430
What's wrong with that?

38:18.464 --> 38:20.999
Well, it's great
in a relationship.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.802
Kind of sucks
for an investigation.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.438
Aw...

38:26.472 --> 38:27.439
Poor baby.

38:27.473 --> 38:28.474
( kissing )

38:41.920 --> 38:44.423
Familiar with
this new advance

38:44.456 --> 38:47.092
in technology called...
power tools?

38:47.125 --> 38:48.427
Close your eyes.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.406
Mm?

39:00.439 --> 39:01.640
You feel the wood?

39:05.477 --> 39:06.612
You don't get
a sensation

39:06.645 --> 39:08.447
like that
from a power tool.

39:09.147 --> 39:11.783
( laughing )

39:16.788 --> 39:18.857
Something is hinky here, McGee.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.993
These are the butts that Kate
found at the crime scene.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.431
Looks like
identical twins.

39:25.464 --> 39:26.832
All from the same pack.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.534
Now, these

39:28.567 --> 39:32.003
are Aaron Wright and Petty
Officer Wilson's Triboros.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.506
Twins, but not identical

39:34.540 --> 39:36.074
because they came
from different packs.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.677
Correct... but not my point.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.614
The killer
didn't smoke Triboros.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.954
The butts that Kate
found were Llamas.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.155
Okay, I gotta call Gibbs.

39:50.188 --> 39:53.559
You just proved that Petty
Officer Wilson isn't the killer.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.694
Or Aaron Wright?

39:55.727 --> 39:58.464
You ruled out both suspects.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.665
No, I didn't.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.567
Either one could still
be the murderer.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.935
All I proved is that
someone smoked Llamas

40:03.969 --> 40:05.170
at Rock Creek Park.

40:10.509 --> 40:13.512
( phone ringing )

40:22.521 --> 40:24.089
( clearing throat ):
Yeah. Gibbs.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.491
Boss, uh...

40:25.524 --> 40:27.626
I-I don't know
if this is important or not.

40:27.659 --> 40:28.827
McGee,

40:28.860 --> 40:30.729
this had better
be the most important

40:30.762 --> 40:32.130
phone call you ever made.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.607
Yeah.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.544
Mm-hmm.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.253
Everything all right?

40:55.286 --> 40:56.555
Yeah.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.898
Come on, what's wrong?

41:08.900 --> 41:11.803
Your petty officer won't
admit to any involvement.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.640
Well... I don't
believe he was.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.110
You got a smoke?

41:21.647 --> 41:23.649
Well, that surprises me.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.926
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

41:35.794 --> 41:38.229
Ever been to Sicily?

41:38.263 --> 41:40.699
Interesting segue.

41:40.732 --> 41:41.800
No.

41:47.238 --> 41:50.909
Capaci's a town
outside Palermo.

41:50.942 --> 41:54.713
In '91, there
was a Mafia don

41:54.746 --> 41:57.215
sitting in a
hillside orchard

41:57.248 --> 41:58.550
chain-smoking,

41:58.584 --> 42:01.720
watching
the road below.

42:01.753 --> 42:04.623
Two cars in a tight formation
came around the corner.

42:06.792 --> 42:09.795
The don hit a switch.

42:09.828 --> 42:12.197
The road exploded.

42:12.230 --> 42:15.601
It killed the chief magistrate

42:15.634 --> 42:20.639
prosecuting the Sicilian Mafia,
his wife and three bodyguards.

42:20.672 --> 42:23.008
The Italian
carabinari, they found

42:23.041 --> 42:25.143
the cigarette butts
in the orchard.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.112
Sent them to our FBI crime lab.

42:27.145 --> 42:30.849
They matched the DNA

42:30.882 --> 42:33.719
from the saliva
on the filters to the don.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.754
It's the first
time that DNA

42:35.787 --> 42:37.789
was ever used
successfully

42:37.823 --> 42:39.825
to prosecute a killer.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.130
You are a very strange man.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.633
( chuckling )

42:47.666 --> 42:49.835
Yeah. Yeah...

42:49.868 --> 42:52.337
It's about
to get stranger.

43:07.719 --> 43:09.721
( snuffing cigarette )

43:14.092 --> 43:15.827
Karen.

43:15.861 --> 43:18.797
I hope that the DNA
on this cigarette

43:18.830 --> 43:22.701
doesn't match the butts
found where Dion was executed.

43:27.706 --> 43:29.374
Oh, I really do.
