- I'm gettin' somethin' on the sonar!
- What is it?

00:27.569 --> 00:30.363
Strong reading from
underneath the cap rock, sir!

00:30.447 --> 00:33.325
- Possible oil flow?
- Still analysing.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.415
It's, uh...

00:41.458 --> 00:43.460
Sounds like, uh...

00:47.547 --> 00:49.632
Tiny hammers.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.582
Let's go skating!

03:09.064 --> 03:12.442
- They're coming right at us!
- Take us to Elfcon three!

03:12.525 --> 03:14.611
Take us to Elfcon three.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.215
These guys aren't stopping.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.260
- Take us to Elfcon two!
- Let's go to Elfcon two.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.051
We have a partridge
in a pear tree.

04:20.135 --> 04:23.972
You take us to Elfcon one.
Let's rig for silent running.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.642
- Look alive, everybody!
- OK, we're at Elfcon one.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.549
- I lost it!
- What do you mean, you lost it?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.301
Wait!

05:02.802 --> 05:04.888
What the...?

05:07.849 --> 05:08.892
Uh...

05:09.601 --> 05:11.520
Sir, you're gonna
want to hear this.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.440
[Smokey Robinson sings]
## You better watch out

05:15.524 --> 05:17.734
## You better not cry

05:17.818 --> 05:20.570
## You better not pout
and I'm telling you why

05:20.654 --> 05:23.281
Find out where
that music's coming from.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.794
Santa, I've got her
on the locator.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.225
## He knows when
you are sleeping

05:50.642 --> 05:53.770
## He knows when you're awake

05:54.271 --> 05:58.275
## He knows if you've
been bad or good

05:58.441 --> 06:00.443
## So be good for goodness'...

06:00.944 --> 06:02.195
## Yeah, yeah, yeah

06:02.821 --> 06:04.322
## You better watch out

06:04.614 --> 06:06.575
## You better not cry

06:06.658 --> 06:08.368
## You better not pout

06:08.452 --> 06:10.829
## And I'm telling you why

06:10.912 --> 06:15.584
## Santa Claus
is coming to tow-...

06:18.336 --> 06:20.255
- What now?
- It's just gone.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.048
In the middle of the chorus!

06:22.132 --> 06:24.342
Nobody needs to
know about this.

06:24.426 --> 06:28.263
Maybe we should mention the
Smokey Robinson thing, sir.

06:28.346 --> 06:31.850
We're at
Elfcon four. All clear.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.979
Curtis, what do you say we get
you headphones this Christmas?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.607
It's all right, everybody.
Let's get back to work.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.777
Curtis, you're 900 years old.
Grow up!

06:42.694 --> 06:44.613
Bernard.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.621
You know I didn't break
any of the rules -

06:52.704 --> 06:54.623
according to The Santa Handbook.

06:54.706 --> 06:58.085
The handbook! Curtis, do you
go pee-pee with that thing?

06:58.168 --> 07:00.754
It says elves are encouraged
to listen to music.

07:00.837 --> 07:05.717
It makes them more creative,
more productive and more alert.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.886
Look out!

07:13.517 --> 07:15.602
Aagghh!

07:17.521 --> 07:19.606
- It's OK.
- Let's go!

07:21.149 --> 07:23.360
Is he all right?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.612
Wow! That's gonna leave a mark.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.156
Oof!

07:28.323 --> 07:30.283
Is that Blitzen?
Looks like Prancer.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.202
- Who is that?
- It was Chet.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.663
- A reindeer in training.
- Oh.

07:35.831 --> 07:36.998
Hmph!

07:37.082 --> 07:40.377
Well, please tell me
that it's early in his training.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.546
Wow! Nice fall.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.674
Curtis, when are you
gonna tell him?

07:45.757 --> 07:47.426
Not now!

08:09.072 --> 08:11.533
It's so cold up here.
How can you not be freezing?

08:11.616 --> 08:15.162
You have not seen cold till you
see where my dad lives. It's...

08:15.245 --> 08:17.539
Don't be embarrassed.
My parents are divorced.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.416
- No big deal.
- I'm not embarrassed.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.377
- Why don't you talk about your dad?
- He doesn't like me to.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.212
- It's complicated.
- Is he a spy?

08:24.296 --> 08:25.922
No, he...

08:26.339 --> 08:28.508
He works with toys and these...

08:29.551 --> 08:32.471
Iittle people. Kids.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.724
Can we just do
what we came here to do?

08:35.807 --> 08:36.892
Sure.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.774
All right.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.610
Charlie, this is
really dangerous.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.571
Someone could catch us
at any moment.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.407
Kinda exciting.

08:52.616 --> 08:56.620
Well, you know, Danielle, I may
not come out of this alive.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.831
So, in case we don't
see each other again...

09:04.378 --> 09:06.254
Aagghh!

09:09.633 --> 09:11.718
Are you OK?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.181
Oof!

09:29.653 --> 09:32.698
[## Danger Danger:
Naughty Naughty Christmas]

09:38.704 --> 09:41.206
- Almost done.
- OK. I'm not leaving.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.379
## I've been a naughty boy

09:47.462 --> 09:51.299
## I didn't get a toy

09:51.425 --> 09:57.139
## Santa Claus left nothing
underneath my tree

09:58.223 --> 10:01.393
## He knows that I've been bad

10:01.727 --> 10:04.813
## But being good just ain't my bag...

10:16.533 --> 10:18.452
Hello, Charlie.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.788
Hello, Principal Newman.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.421
OK, try it now.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.594
OK, all right.
Here's what we need.

10:36.637 --> 10:40.641
Get one more bolt on that flange
and it's ready for Christmas.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.726
Good work, guys. Whew!

10:44.061 --> 10:45.979
Perfect job on suspension,
you guys.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.523
Thinkin' outside the box.
I love it.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.988
- Do you want a cookie, Santa?
- Do I want a cookie?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.990
Yes! What's fresh?

10:57.741 --> 10:58.867
Oooh!

10:58.951 --> 11:01.203
Sweet, just like you.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.712
Alexander, let's think.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.674
Take the hat off.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.678
Too much counterweight.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.347
Thanks, Santa. You're the man.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.392
That's why they give me the big
belly, so I don't fall over!

11:25.185 --> 11:28.772
Hey, Joey! How's that
static-free-tinsel coming?

11:29.439 --> 11:32.526
Hey, guys, Santa wants to
see the new tinsel.

11:40.909 --> 11:44.663
I could come up there and take
care of this the ugly way.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.749
Or... we go outside
and play some football.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.340
Curtis, you need to
tell him right now!

11:55.716 --> 11:59.094
I don't know.
He's so happy right now.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.305
And why do I have to be
the one to tell him?!

12:01.388 --> 12:04.558
Because I'm the head elf.
I don't give bad news.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.852
It's one of the perks
of my seniority.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.979
Now, tell him!

12:29.625 --> 12:31.793
Come on, pork chop. Bring it on.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.880
Who you callin' pork chop,
meatloaf?

12:34.963 --> 12:36.715
Meatloaf?!

12:37.007 --> 12:39.927
You wanna talk some trash?
I'll talk trash with ya.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.930
- But first, I'm gonna blitz.
- Ready, set!

12:43.263 --> 12:46.725
- I'm comin' after you, buddy.
- Seven swans a-swimming!

12:46.808 --> 12:48.727
Six geese a-laying!

12:49.061 --> 12:51.647
Five golden rings!

12:51.730 --> 12:53.273
Hike!

12:55.275 --> 12:57.736
Hey, who's got the ball?
I can see it. Let go of me.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.530
He's too quick! He spins!
He moves! He's on the way!

13:00.614 --> 13:03.450
And he might go all the...

13:04.952 --> 13:06.370
way!

13:06.453 --> 13:08.580
Rumblin', stumblin', bumblin'!

13:08.664 --> 13:10.749
Oh, they pile on!

13:15.128 --> 13:17.214
OK, you win!

13:24.721 --> 13:26.848
You guys aren't elves.
You're wizards!

13:26.932 --> 13:30.185
No matter how many times you run
that play I never see it comin'.

13:30.269 --> 13:33.355
Santa? We need to talk.

13:44.283 --> 13:46.451
- That's weird, isn't it?
- Uh-oh!

13:46.535 --> 13:49.454
- These fit yesterday.
- Hot cocoa for you.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.707
This is not a good time, Abby.

13:51.790 --> 13:55.377
I sent Dasher down
for some Brazilian cocoa beans.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.923
- What's the bad news?
- What do you mean?

14:00.424 --> 14:05.679
Whenever you play the designer
bean card, you have bad news.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.810
What are you doing with
the naughty-and-nice list?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.645
Don't shoot the messenger.

14:17.983 --> 14:21.320
- It's... Charlie.
- Sheen?

14:21.820 --> 14:25.157
- I thought he straightened out.
- Not that Charlie.

14:28.994 --> 14:32.664
My Charlie. My son Charlie?
He's on the naughty list?

14:35.083 --> 14:38.253
- There's gotta be a mistake.
- We don't make mistakes.

14:38.337 --> 14:41.757
I'm sorry, Santa.
Please excuse me.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.637
How could this happen? Is this
what you were trying to tell me?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.932
Great! You told him! Let's get
you dressed for that meeting.

14:50.015 --> 14:53.644
I can't have the meeting here.
I'm gonna have to see Charlie.

14:53.727 --> 14:58.190
- Number two, tell him now.
- Tell me what, guys? Come clean.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.859
- Santa, there's a clause.
- That would be me.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.695
No, I mean there's another
Santa clause.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.406
Curtis, in case you haven't
noticed - this time of year,

15:06.490 --> 15:08.992
the malls are filled with
other "Santa Clauses".

15:09.076 --> 15:11.829
Yes, but there's another
Santa clause.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.748
There was a first clause,
but also a second clause.

15:14.832 --> 15:16.375
Get on with it!

15:18.001 --> 15:22.464
When the last Santa fell off your roof
and you put on his coat, you found this.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.842
Right. "He who wears the coat

15:25.551 --> 15:28.303
takes on the responsibilities
of Santa Claus."

15:28.387 --> 15:30.472
And the rest
would be history, right?

15:30.556 --> 15:34.643
But it seems our number two elf,
the keeper of the handbook,

15:35.561 --> 15:39.857
overlooked the single
most important detail

15:39.940 --> 15:41.942
in the history of Christmas!

15:42.359 --> 15:45.612
Wow! One mistake in 900 years.

15:46.697 --> 15:48.407
Look.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.452
- I can't see that.
- Better now?

15:51.618 --> 15:52.870
- Or now?
- Well...

15:53.454 --> 15:55.414
- Better now?
- It's gettin' there.

15:55.497 --> 15:58.000
- Or now?
- I can't see anything.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.962
I see. Good, good, good.
I see it. OK.

16:02.504 --> 16:06.258
"The card holder acknowledges
a woman of his choosing..."

16:06.341 --> 16:10.804
"True love... Not valid
in the state of Utah..."

16:11.263 --> 16:12.598
"Holy...

16:14.683 --> 16:16.310
matrimony?!"

16:16.393 --> 16:18.937
- I gotta get married!
- Yes.

16:19.188 --> 16:21.815
It's... the Mrs clause.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.526
["Here Comes The Bride"]

16:26.028 --> 16:28.322
What if I don't want
to get married?

16:29.656 --> 16:32.618
Oh, dear. The de-Santification
process has begun!

16:32.701 --> 16:35.287
The de-Santification?

16:36.497 --> 16:40.667
Are you telling me that clause
says if I don't get married...

16:41.293 --> 16:43.378
I don't get to be
Santa any more?

16:48.133 --> 16:51.053
Wh-... what about the kids?

16:52.012 --> 16:53.931
What about the elves?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.727
- What about you guys?
- It's not completely hopeless.

16:58.811 --> 17:01.146
You still have time
to find a wife.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.816
- How much time do I have?
- 28 days.

17:05.067 --> 17:08.569
28 days? So I've gotta...
find a wife by Christmas.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.698
Actually, Christmas Eve.

17:14.576 --> 17:18.079
- I guess it's over.
- No! You can't think that way!

17:18.163 --> 17:20.540
Please, don't give up hope.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.713
Cos if you do, then we have to.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.684
- Whoa!

17:40.894 --> 17:43.522
Christmas is getting
very complicated.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.442
Santa?

17:46.775 --> 17:47.818
Santa?

17:48.610 --> 17:52.156
- Are you with us?
- I'm sorry, yes. Yes, I am.

17:52.239 --> 17:57.661
Well, on behalf of Father Time and
the Council of Legendary Figures,

17:57.786 --> 18:00.581
I'd like to thank you for being
such a gracious host.

18:00.664 --> 18:03.083
- Hear, hear.
- What a lovely place.

18:03.375 --> 18:07.713
Without further ado, let us
convene the year-end conference.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.716
- Tooth Fairy.
- Thank you, Mother Nature.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.468
Fellow Council members,

18:12.551 --> 18:15.179
I'd like to again propose
a new name for myself.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.222
- Oh, please!
- Good heavens!

18:19.016 --> 18:22.227
In the past, you have rejected
Tooth Man, Tooth Guy and Tooth.

18:22.311 --> 18:25.731
- Because they stunk.
- Today, I'd like to submit...

18:25.814 --> 18:27.358
- Captain Floss.
- Nice!

18:27.441 --> 18:28.734
- Plaque Man.

18:28.817 --> 18:32.321
- And Roy.
- Roy! No.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.699
No kid's gonna put a tooth under
a pillow for a man named Roy.

18:35.783 --> 18:38.619
This from someone in a diaper
who shoots people's butts!

18:38.702 --> 18:40.788
Wait a minute. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

18:40.871 --> 18:43.248
Now, how about this?
The Molarnator.

18:43.332 --> 18:46.043
The Molarnator! I like it.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.671
Thank you, Santa. Can we
vote now on the Molarnator?

18:48.754 --> 18:51.882
All in favour of a name change
for Tooth Fairy?

18:53.050 --> 18:54.802
All right. And all opposed?

18:55.803 --> 18:57.596
Easter Bunny?

18:58.639 --> 19:00.808
- Sandman?
- Wha-...?

19:00.974 --> 19:03.394
What happened?
Was I asleep again?

19:04.353 --> 19:07.272
Name change for the Tooth Fairy.
Yes or no?

19:07.523 --> 19:09.316
No. I'm sorry.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.612
All right. Next item on the
agenda. Santa? Status report.

19:13.696 --> 19:17.866
OK. First, welcome to the North
Pole. Great to have you here.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.995
This is our big time of year,
so things are busy as usual.

19:21.078 --> 19:24.331
There's a little speed bump
in the road this year.

19:24.415 --> 19:27.459
- You all know Charlie.
- I love Charlie!

19:27.710 --> 19:29.169
- Great kid.
- Good boy.

19:29.253 --> 19:31.005
- Sweet kid.
- Good teeth.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.675
Well, Charlie...
got himself on the naughty list.

19:34.883 --> 19:36.468
- What?!
- Oh, my!

19:36.552 --> 19:39.305
I'm struggling with the timing,
cos it's...

19:39.388 --> 19:42.641
I gotta be up here and I've also
got to take care of Charlie...

19:42.725 --> 19:44.977
That's every parent's dilemma:

19:45.352 --> 19:47.688
how to balance
work and children.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.232
Most people lose sleep over that.

19:50.316 --> 19:55.362
Tell me about it! I have 33,000
offspring. All in private school.

19:57.614 --> 20:01.785
Well, to top it off... I have to get
married by Christmas Eve.

20:01.869 --> 20:04.622
- What?!
- Otherwise I stop being Santa.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.081
- What?!
- No!

20:06.165 --> 20:08.792
The de-Santification process
has already begun.

20:08.876 --> 20:10.753
Wait a minute.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.838
You do look thinner, and...

20:12.921 --> 20:16.175
- Your beard is shorter! Right?
- You're right!

20:16.258 --> 20:19.094
Apparently,
it's called the Mrs clause.

20:19.303 --> 20:21.555
Don't mess with me, Santa.
I'm pre-El Nino.

20:21.639 --> 20:25.351
No, I'm not messing with
anybody. What I'm saying is...

20:25.434 --> 20:27.061
I have to find a wife in...

20:27.144 --> 20:31.523
27 days, 20 hours
and 1 7 minutes.

20:31.607 --> 20:34.568
- Wow!
- It's what I do.

20:35.736 --> 20:38.364
Wait a minute. Cupid!
Cupid, come over here.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.616
- What do you need?
- Shoot me with a dart.

20:40.699 --> 20:44.036
- Then I'll fall in love.
- First of all, they're arrows.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.788
Second of all, no can do.

20:45.996 --> 20:48.290
- Why not?
- Arrows have no effect on us.

20:48.374 --> 20:51.835
If they did, I would have shot
myself, met a nice girl,

20:51.919 --> 20:53.712
Ieft the business years ago.

20:53.796 --> 20:56.757
- Enough with the questions.
- You can't stop being Santa.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.259
I don't want to.

20:58.342 --> 21:01.303
Kids are 86 per cent happier
since you've taken the job.

21:01.387 --> 21:03.514
- He's right.
- This is all I want to do.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.976
But what am I gonna do?

21:07.309 --> 21:09.019
Well, you...

21:09.728 --> 21:12.147
You can't be two places at once.

21:13.941 --> 21:15.109
Maybe you can be.

21:15.693 --> 21:19.154
OK, everyone, can I get the
room for a minute? Thank you.

21:19.238 --> 21:21.949
Can I just...? One minute.
Take a cocoa break.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.660
Have a nice long break.
Relax, everyone.

21:24.743 --> 21:28.664
I want to show Santa some improvements
on the pantograph. Thanks.

21:28.747 --> 21:34.044
Walk with me. I've tripled the RAM
and reconfigured the circuitry.

21:34.295 --> 21:37.131
I see you've externalised
the power source

21:37.214 --> 21:39.842
to make better use of
the electromagnetic energy.

21:39.925 --> 21:42.428
No, it's just there
cos it looks really cool.

21:42.511 --> 21:44.346
Yeah, it does.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.182
Wait a minute.
You tripled the RAM.

21:47.892 --> 21:51.061
I see where this is going. I am
not getting in that machine.

21:51.186 --> 21:55.232
Besides, creating a copy of
Santa won't solve our problems.

21:55.316 --> 21:59.278
- The elves'll know.
- But this would be a special toy!

21:59.361 --> 22:03.032
- How's that, Curtis?
- I added a fuzzy logic circuit.

22:03.115 --> 22:05.451
The duplicate will look
and think just like you.

22:05.534 --> 22:09.204
When you're with your family, dealing
with Charlie, looking for a wife...

22:09.288 --> 22:12.458
The toy will be up here melting
in front of my fireplace.

22:12.541 --> 22:15.502
No, the toy Santa will be
dealing with business up here.

22:15.586 --> 22:17.671
I can deal with
business up here.

22:17.755 --> 22:20.925
Santa, if the elves find out
we've made a switch... Aaggh!

22:21.008 --> 22:23.469
No! No!
This machine is not the answer.

22:27.973 --> 22:30.059
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You! You! Shoo!

22:31.602 --> 22:34.563
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:53.082 --> 22:55.543
Look, you can't get
much better than that.

22:56.961 --> 23:00.464
And I promise -
it won't hurt a bit.

23:05.970 --> 23:08.973
- I'm goin' in.
- I can't watch this!

23:40.129 --> 23:42.214
Ow! Ow!

24:04.695 --> 24:06.238
It's perfect!

24:08.699 --> 24:11.452
That's because it's me,
Einstein.

24:13.370 --> 24:16.165
- Santa, are you all right?
- Yeah, I got a shock in there.

24:16.248 --> 24:18.167
Is there supposed to be a shock?

24:18.250 --> 24:20.085
Aagghh!

24:21.670 --> 24:23.506
It's naked!

24:27.468 --> 24:29.220
Throw something over it.

24:29.303 --> 24:32.473
- It's incredible!
- Yes, it is.

24:36.685 --> 24:38.687
Can he talk?

24:40.856 --> 24:42.483
Hello?

24:45.903 --> 24:47.738
Hello?

24:48.364 --> 24:49.824
Hello?

24:52.785 --> 24:54.703
Ho, ho, ho!

24:55.621 --> 24:57.998
Ho, ho... ho!

24:58.332 --> 25:00.709
- Not bad.
- Not bad yourself.

25:03.254 --> 25:04.880
I can't put my finger on it,

25:04.964 --> 25:07.049
but there's something
about you that I like.

25:07.133 --> 25:09.760
There's something
about you that I like!

25:12.805 --> 25:17.184
- Watch him. I'll be right back.
- He's coming right back.

25:18.477 --> 25:19.520
Ha-ha-ha!

25:20.521 --> 25:23.232
- Bernard, I need your help.
- What do you mean?

25:23.315 --> 25:24.984
What I mean is
I gotta go see Charlie

25:25.067 --> 25:27.611
and I want you to
convince the elves...

25:27.695 --> 25:30.156
that... toy Santa is me.

25:30.239 --> 25:33.492
- Hm. Have you seen that thing?
- I've seen it.

25:33.576 --> 25:35.619
Keep the elves
at a distance and say

25:35.703 --> 25:38.038
that I've changed my look,
it'll work.

25:38.122 --> 25:40.791
Santa, we're in
way over our heads here.

25:40.875 --> 25:43.377
If anybody can do this,
it's you, number one.

25:43.461 --> 25:47.006
I... I'm not gonna lie to all the elves.

25:47.089 --> 25:50.009
I myself think he looks
absolutely terrific!

25:50.092 --> 25:53.429
Better and fresher somehow
than he has in years.

25:53.846 --> 25:56.682
There's now a more supple
veneer to his skin

25:56.766 --> 25:59.226
and an added lustre
to the thickness of his hair.

25:59.310 --> 26:01.645
You could almost say
there's a...

26:02.271 --> 26:04.106
a toy-like quality to him.

26:04.815 --> 26:07.943
Most importantly, he's very
happy with his new look,

26:08.027 --> 26:11.280
and I would caution you all
not to point or stare

26:11.697 --> 26:13.532
or use the word "plastic".

26:13.741 --> 26:15.284
OK? OK.

26:15.367 --> 26:18.120
Thank you. That's all.
Back to work, please.

26:26.754 --> 26:29.423
Comet, because I don't
want to take Prancer.

26:29.507 --> 26:33.135
I want to take a trip with you.
When's the last time we had a cruise?

26:33.219 --> 26:34.970
I love you, buddy.

26:35.096 --> 26:38.933
Besides, Prancer had too many
apples. We know what that means.

26:39.016 --> 26:41.435
Before you go,
take a look at your watch.

26:41.519 --> 26:43.729
Hey! Can't go anywhere
without that.

26:43.813 --> 26:47.316
- I've done some work on it.
- It's beautiful. It really is.

26:47.400 --> 26:51.112
- You like it?
- The workmanship's fabulous.

26:51.195 --> 26:54.490
It has a power reserve that measures
how much magic you have left.

26:54.573 --> 26:56.409
- It's at ten.
- That should be enough.

26:56.492 --> 27:00.413
But if you use up any magic
for any reason the level drops.

27:01.247 --> 27:06.252
Santa, if it gets to zero - you won't
be able to return to the Pole.

27:06.335 --> 27:08.212
Uh-oh.

27:09.797 --> 27:12.091
Then let's not let it get to zero!

27:12.174 --> 27:15.553
- Now, look at me.
- Mm-hm?

27:16.637 --> 27:18.973
What's the most important thing?

27:19.557 --> 27:21.392
For you not to touch Santa?

27:22.184 --> 27:24.145
For you to come back!

27:25.813 --> 27:27.231
Thank you.

27:27.356 --> 27:31.068
Comet, please just
chill out a little bit, OK?

27:31.152 --> 27:35.364
Come on! It's not like we're
pullin' the sleigh. Right?

27:35.448 --> 27:37.658
There's no packages.
It's one stop.

27:37.742 --> 27:41.203
And I think I might have forgot
we're gonna go see Charlie.

27:53.549 --> 27:56.010
Scott! Hey!
You trimmed your beard.

27:56.093 --> 27:57.511
Yeah.

27:57.970 --> 28:00.056
Come here, big guy.

28:01.724 --> 28:03.684
Whoa! Lost some
weight there, huh?

28:03.768 --> 28:05.853
- Slim-Fast?
- You don't know how fast.

28:05.936 --> 28:07.855
- We should get going.
- Oh, OK.

28:07.938 --> 28:10.191
How do you always know
when there's a problem?

28:10.274 --> 28:13.277
I see you when you're sleepin'.
I know when you're awake.

28:13.361 --> 28:16.489
Which is a pretty frightening
concept when you think about it.

28:16.572 --> 28:18.991
We're really worried
about Charlie.

28:19.075 --> 28:22.536
He keeps upping the ante. This
time he defaced school property.

28:22.620 --> 28:25.665
- It's classic acting out.
- I'm blaming myself for this.

28:25.748 --> 28:28.417
- We're both his parents.
- Where is he?

28:28.626 --> 28:31.462
He's waiting for us
in Principal Newman's office.

28:31.545 --> 28:35.341
Something about her makes me
want to deface public property.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.593
Hello, Mr Calvin. Laura, Neil.

28:38.010 --> 28:40.429
- Miss Newman.
- Principal Newman.

28:40.930 --> 28:43.808
Haven't seen you since the last
time Charlie was in trouble.

28:43.891 --> 28:46.060
I've been travelling for work.

28:46.227 --> 28:49.480
If you spent more time with your
son there'd be fewer problems.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.732
Then I wouldn't spend
so much time with you,

28:51.816 --> 28:53.818
which is always
such a pleasure.

28:53.901 --> 28:57.530
A battle of wits. It's a shame
you come unarmed. Excuse me.

28:59.031 --> 29:00.574
Ouch!

29:02.952 --> 29:04.787
Good morning, Principal Newman.

29:04.870 --> 29:08.582
Mr Picardo, I want you to look into
my eyes. What do you see?

29:10.251 --> 29:12.628
It's dark. And it's cold.

29:12.795 --> 29:15.339
It's your future, Mr Picardo -
keep this up

29:15.423 --> 29:17.800
and you will spend
your life stabbing trash.

29:17.883 --> 29:19.802
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes.

29:19.885 --> 29:23.222
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm going to geometry.

29:23.306 --> 29:25.391
Have a nice trip.

29:31.230 --> 29:35.026
It's an affront to authority and
blatant disrespect for property.

29:35.109 --> 29:38.154
If this continues I'll have no
other recourse than to suspend..

29:38.237 --> 29:42.366
Excuse me. Is there a rest stop between
here and the end of the lecture?

29:42.450 --> 29:45.369
I'm more interested in why this
happened in the first place.

29:45.453 --> 29:48.623
So am l. Charlie, we're all
worried about you.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.960
It feels like you're trying to
get someone's attention.

29:53.085 --> 29:55.171
What's bothering you?

29:58.215 --> 29:59.675
- Dr Miller?
- Neil.

29:59.759 --> 30:03.596
- Neil, any theories?
- Well, frankly I have several.

30:04.221 --> 30:06.432
Here we go.
Let's just order a pizza.

30:06.515 --> 30:08.267
Scott, you're not helping.

30:08.351 --> 30:12.980
I was listening to a tape series
on child development last night.

30:14.565 --> 30:17.401
You know what the problem is?
Excuse me, Neil.

30:18.486 --> 30:20.821
It's four weeks until Christmas.

30:20.988 --> 30:23.491
- That's a holiday in December.
- Oh.

30:23.699 --> 30:27.245
Have you noticed the hallways?
Not a decoration, not a twinkle light,

30:27.328 --> 30:31.499
not an expression of the joy
kids are supposed to be feeling.

30:31.874 --> 30:34.961
- What kind of school is this?
- A public school.

30:35.044 --> 30:39.882
A top-rated public school.
That takes effort. And money.

30:40.258 --> 30:43.219
Spending any of that money
on holiday decorations

30:43.302 --> 30:45.721
would take away from
the things that truly matter.

30:45.805 --> 30:48.516
Forgive me, but I think
holiday cheer really matters.

30:48.599 --> 30:50.768
What are we going to do?
We are worried...

30:50.851 --> 30:54.522
Let me handle this. You know
what you did is wrong. Right?

30:54.605 --> 30:56.440
- I guess so.
- There's no guessing.

30:56.524 --> 30:58.859
Guessing is gone.
It was wrong what you did.

30:58.943 --> 31:01.779
And you're not gonna
do it again. Promise me.

31:01.862 --> 31:03.447
- OK.
- There you go.

31:03.906 --> 31:06.534
He won't do it again.
Meeting is adjourned.

31:06.617 --> 31:09.036
It most certainly is not!
Charlie...

31:09.120 --> 31:11.372
You know what else?
Here's a little donation.

31:11.455 --> 31:14.208
Why don't you
buy yourself a wreath?

31:16.794 --> 31:18.421
I am Santa Claus.

31:18.504 --> 31:19.547
Boo!

31:21.090 --> 31:23.718
Yeah. No, no,
I think that this is gonna work.

31:23.801 --> 31:26.095
Good... Good job, Curtis.

31:26.929 --> 31:30.099
Would it kill you to give
a wholehearted compliment?

31:30.182 --> 31:31.225
Ho, ho, ho.

31:32.018 --> 31:33.895
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Santa?

31:35.438 --> 31:38.691
- I need you to look at this.
- All right!

31:39.609 --> 31:41.027
Nice!

31:41.110 --> 31:42.862
No. I mean,
I need you to read it.

31:42.945 --> 31:45.781
Well, let's try to be
specific, shall we?

31:45.865 --> 31:46.908
Ha-ha!

31:47.241 --> 31:49.744
I'll take a look at it
over at my desk.

31:50.870 --> 31:53.748
- How does he know where it is?
- I programmed him that way.

31:53.831 --> 31:56.083
He has most of Santa's memories.

31:56.876 --> 32:00.630
OK, we need you to study
everything that's in that book

32:00.755 --> 32:03.257
because it is the key
to being Santa.

32:04.425 --> 32:07.595
Right! I'll memorise
everything in the book.

32:08.638 --> 32:11.307
I'll follow all the rules.

32:12.433 --> 32:14.185
Cos rules are very important!

32:16.020 --> 32:18.231
- I like this guy.
- I can barely read this.

32:18.314 --> 32:19.357
Hi, Santa.

32:19.774 --> 32:20.816
Uh...

32:21.317 --> 32:24.153
- Hi.
- Oh. You look...

32:24.237 --> 32:27.031
Like he got
a good night's sleep.

32:29.742 --> 32:33.704
Like you got a very
good night's sleep.

32:34.455 --> 32:37.542
How about a nice
chocolatey cocoa?

32:51.764 --> 32:54.892
- Careful, it's hot.
- Of course it is.

33:10.116 --> 33:11.492
Aagh!

33:13.786 --> 33:14.829
Whoo!

33:15.872 --> 33:19.375
That's delicious! I like cocoa!

33:19.584 --> 33:22.378
Cocoa's superior refreshment!

33:22.461 --> 33:24.630
Get me some more cocoa!

33:24.839 --> 33:25.798
Whoo!

33:25.882 --> 33:27.216
Right away, Santa.

33:27.467 --> 33:28.509
Ho, whoa!

33:29.469 --> 33:32.138
I think Santa feels
a little buzz!

33:32.889 --> 33:33.931
Whoooo!

33:35.933 --> 33:38.811
Let me get this straight.
You were de-Santified?

33:38.895 --> 33:42.648
And you only have 27 days
to find a wife or you're out?

33:43.649 --> 33:45.109
Yeah.

33:45.193 --> 33:47.653
What are you gonna do?
We dated for three years

33:47.737 --> 33:49.989
before you got up
the courage to propose.

33:50.072 --> 33:53.367
That's a pretty serious
commitment issue, isn't it?

33:53.451 --> 33:56.287
Yes, Sigmund. I was afraid
I'd mess up the first time.

33:56.370 --> 33:58.748
- I'm more afraid now.
- Dad, you can't give up.

33:58.831 --> 34:00.833
There's never been
a better Santa.

34:00.917 --> 34:02.752
I appreciate that.

34:02.835 --> 34:05.421
It's for the best. If l
had spent more time with you,

34:05.505 --> 34:08.049
you'd spend less time in
the spray paint industry.

34:08.132 --> 34:10.676
Don't do that to yourself.
You have been a great dad.

34:10.760 --> 34:13.471
And being Santa has made you
an even better man.

34:13.554 --> 34:15.723
I'm gonna go out
on an emotional limb.

34:15.806 --> 34:17.683
Don't try to make me cry.

34:17.766 --> 34:21.437
Believe it or not, you have
a great capacity for love.

34:21.646 --> 34:23.563
I know you can
find someone wonderful

34:23.648 --> 34:25.690
to spend the rest of
your life with.

34:25.775 --> 34:29.320
Don't let the facts that you
have no time, no prospects

34:29.402 --> 34:32.489
and a paralysing fear of
intimacy get you down.

34:32.572 --> 34:33.616
Hm.

34:34.324 --> 34:36.284
Have you ever
helped anyone? Ever?

34:36.369 --> 34:39.746
You know what I'm gonna do? I am
gonna look through my phone book

34:39.831 --> 34:42.500
and see who's still single out
there and not too bitter.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.962
There's divorced moms at school
who'll go out with anybody.

34:46.045 --> 34:49.590
As promising as this sounds,
I don't need help with this area.

34:49.674 --> 34:53.136
Your old man was a high-school
legend. A double letterman.

34:53.219 --> 34:54.971
I had a Mustang.

34:55.054 --> 34:56.931
So as far as dating goes,

34:57.014 --> 35:00.935
I think if anybody can stir up
the old mojo it would be moi.

35:01.227 --> 35:03.896
Come on! I don't think
there's a woman out there

35:03.980 --> 35:06.065
that doesn't want
a piece of this.

35:09.527 --> 35:11.320
- Hi, Mom!
- Lucy!

35:12.947 --> 35:15.867
- Uncle Scott!
- How's my little sweet pea?

35:16.534 --> 35:19.746
Ohh! I haven't seen you in a long time.

35:19.829 --> 35:23.458
- Tell me what's been happenin'.
- I learned to swim underwater.

35:23.541 --> 35:26.210
- And I'm not afraid!
- That's amazing!

35:26.836 --> 35:31.549
Maybe we'll have to go to the mall
and... get some ice cream.

35:31.924 --> 35:34.927
- Plenty of women at the mall.
- Charlie...!

35:35.303 --> 35:38.389
Santa, look forward and
put on a smiley face.

35:38.639 --> 35:40.892
- Say hello to your elves.
- Ho, ho, ho!

35:40.975 --> 35:43.478
You're doing a wonderful job!

35:44.228 --> 35:49.067
Santa, when you said the bigger
wheels, is this what you meant?

35:49.150 --> 35:50.193
Ho, ho, ho!

35:50.276 --> 35:52.361
You're doing a wonderful job!

35:53.196 --> 35:55.907
You're doing great.
Dial it down on the ho-ho-ho's,

35:55.990 --> 35:57.909
but otherwise you're gold.

35:58.117 --> 35:59.160
Ho, ho ho!

36:01.370 --> 36:03.748
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

36:05.333 --> 36:09.128
Why don't you just say it? "You
were right, Curtis. I was wrong."

36:09.212 --> 36:10.463
OK, OK, I admit it.

36:11.964 --> 36:14.258
They're happy.
They're working hard.

36:14.342 --> 36:16.344
Everything's going to be fine.

36:16.427 --> 36:18.429
This book is very
interesting reading.

36:18.513 --> 36:21.265
There's a lot of rules
they're not following.

36:21.349 --> 36:23.476
That's what I've been
saying all along.

36:23.559 --> 36:26.896
Things have gotten
a little too sloppy around here.

36:26.979 --> 36:31.359
Yes! Sloppiness means mistakes.
Mistakes aren't a good thing!

36:34.362 --> 36:36.531
I might have to
make some changes here.

36:36.614 --> 36:39.534
- What do you have in mind?
- Let me show you.

36:39.659 --> 36:41.953
There's many things.
Look here...

36:42.036 --> 36:46.708
Neil, are you sure you don't have
any other clothes I can borrow?

36:46.791 --> 36:49.085
I mean, the idea tonight
is to attract a woman.

36:49.168 --> 36:52.380
- What are you talking about?
- I look like a limesicle.

36:52.463 --> 36:54.465
I think it makes you look hot.

36:54.841 --> 36:57.468
What do you think, Laura?
Honestly, what do you think?

36:57.552 --> 36:59.470
Doesn't he look hot, Laura?

36:59.554 --> 37:02.598
I think it's what's inside
that really counts.

37:02.682 --> 37:05.184
- Thought you liked the sweater.
- We'll talk later.

37:05.268 --> 37:07.103
I'm off.
I may need to borrow a car.

37:07.186 --> 37:10.815
I'm parked behind Neil. The
minivan - I just had it washed.

37:11.649 --> 37:13.484
The minivan.

37:13.568 --> 37:15.570
OK, then. Well, wish me luck.

37:16.112 --> 37:19.282
I got a needlepoint sweater,
and a minivan...

37:19.866 --> 37:22.035
See ya in about eight minutes.

37:32.628 --> 37:34.464
Scott? Hey.

37:34.547 --> 37:37.008
- Tracy!
- Yes!

37:37.091 --> 37:39.927
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

37:40.386 --> 37:43.139
- Here, why don't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you.

37:43.222 --> 37:45.308
Thank you very much.

37:49.312 --> 37:51.356
So, I'm so glad
we finally got to do this.

37:51.439 --> 37:53.858
- I'm pretty nervous.
- Oh, are you?

37:54.192 --> 37:56.069
Laura says
we have a lot in common.

37:56.152 --> 37:58.404
I hear that you love
this time of year also?

37:58.488 --> 38:01.199
It's my favourite time of year
and my busiest time of year.

38:01.282 --> 38:03.826
- Whoa, look at the sweater!
- Yeah!

38:03.910 --> 38:07.372
Some sweater.
Like I should talk!

38:08.122 --> 38:10.625
I also have my Christmas
charm bracelet.

38:10.708 --> 38:14.629
- That's beautiful. Look at 'em!
- Yeah.

38:14.712 --> 38:17.215
I wear it all year long
just to keep the spirit alive.

38:17.298 --> 38:22.345
That's gorgeous. A little teddy bear
and packages. That's very nice.

38:23.346 --> 38:27.725
- So what work do you do?
- I'm in the toy business.

38:27.809 --> 38:29.894
- No way!
- Way!

38:33.231 --> 38:35.984
- That sounds so creative.
- I love it.

38:36.067 --> 38:38.319
- I love creative people.
- Yeah?

38:38.778 --> 38:40.238
Yeah.

38:43.574 --> 38:45.159
So what do you do?

38:45.243 --> 38:48.204
I'm hoping someday to break
into the music business.

38:48.288 --> 38:50.290
- As a singer-songwriter.
- No way!

38:50.373 --> 38:51.833
Way!

38:53.668 --> 38:56.296
- What's your favourite music?
- Country-western.

38:56.379 --> 38:58.131
- Ohh!
- Yeah.

38:58.214 --> 39:00.550
- Do you like Shania Twain?
- Yeah!

39:01.342 --> 39:05.555
## The best thing about
singing at Christmas

39:05.638 --> 39:08.683
## Is the cocoa,
carolling and fun

39:08.766 --> 39:11.102
- You know that one?
- I know that song.

39:11.185 --> 39:13.062
## Go totally yuletide

39:13.229 --> 39:15.356
- ## Takin' a sleigh ride
- You're good.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.692
## Santa shirts, reindeer skirts

39:17.942 --> 39:19.444
## Whoah-oh-oh!
- Hey!

39:19.986 --> 39:23.781
## Watchin' the windows
fog, drinkin' some eggnog

39:23.865 --> 39:26.034
- That's good.
- ## Whoah-oh-oh!

39:26.659 --> 39:28.369
## Fill up a stocking

39:28.453 --> 39:30.580
## Spray on some flocking

39:30.663 --> 39:33.166
Put up a tree!
Sports on TV!

39:33.333 --> 39:35.335
## Uh, whoah-oh-oh

39:35.585 --> 39:40.006
## I want to be free, yeah
to feel the way I feel

39:40.298 --> 39:42.050
## Ah, ah, ah, ah

39:42.133 --> 39:43.426
Man!

39:43.509 --> 39:45.345
## I feel like some Christmas

39:45.637 --> 39:49.557
## Oh-oh, wow wow wow! ##

39:57.065 --> 39:59.150
Whew!

40:01.361 --> 40:03.112
You hated it?

40:03.196 --> 40:05.698
It kind of scared me
a little bit.

40:06.449 --> 40:08.243
No, I just. I...

40:08.618 --> 40:12.038
I just... I wasn't prepared
for a performance, so if l...

40:12.121 --> 40:15.625
I put myself out and that was
not an easy thing to do.

40:15.959 --> 40:18.169
If you can't support
a woman's ambition,

40:18.253 --> 40:21.381
then I don't think there's any
reason to continue this date.

40:25.218 --> 40:26.719
- Dad?
- Hey, sport.

40:26.803 --> 40:28.471
How'd it go?

40:28.680 --> 40:30.139
Well...

40:31.307 --> 40:35.019
Let's just say
I'm not bookin' a church yet.

40:36.813 --> 40:39.607
Boy, I'll tell ya,
women are hard to figure out.

40:39.691 --> 40:42.944
- Tell me about it.
- You too, huh? Girl trouble?

40:43.486 --> 40:45.488
Well, there's this one girl.

40:46.489 --> 40:50.577
We just used to be friends and
hang out at the mall and stuff.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.495
Then one day I looked at her

40:52.579 --> 40:55.248
and I got this weird feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

40:55.331 --> 40:57.667
I started worrying about
what to wear

40:57.750 --> 40:59.919
and what my hair
looked like...

41:00.753 --> 41:02.839
And then I wanted to kiss her.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.634
How did she do that?

41:06.718 --> 41:09.137
I don't know.
But they all can do that.

41:10.722 --> 41:13.558
Oh, look at that.
The snow globe!

41:14.434 --> 41:17.770
This is so beautiful. I remember
when Bernard gave this to you.

41:17.854 --> 41:20.481
He said all I have to do
to see you is shake it.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.608
Uh-huh.

41:22.192 --> 41:25.111
Now, all you have to do
is yell down the hall.

41:25.195 --> 41:27.405
And I'm there
whenever you need me.

41:27.488 --> 41:28.948
Yeah.

41:29.407 --> 41:33.286
I'm a little tired, Dad.
I'll see you in the morning.

41:35.622 --> 41:37.040
OK.

41:37.123 --> 41:38.875
- Good night.
- Night.

41:40.335 --> 41:42.420
Can you turn
the light off, please?

41:42.504 --> 41:45.381
Yeah, cos it's
such a big reach for you!

41:53.556 --> 41:55.975
What do you mean
it's not straight?

41:58.186 --> 42:00.271
- Sure it's straight.
- Uh-uh.

42:01.189 --> 42:04.025
- Maybe your head's crooked.

42:04.776 --> 42:08.112
- Prancer's not this picky.
- Yes, he is.

42:08.404 --> 42:10.323
- Hi, Comet.
- Hi!

42:13.326 --> 42:15.245
I've got something for you.

42:15.537 --> 42:17.789
Hey, Lucy,
what have you got there?

42:19.582 --> 42:22.585
Careful with the sweets.
He tends to overeat.

42:22.669 --> 42:25.004
Uncle Scott,
are you Santa Claus?

42:25.255 --> 42:27.757
What? Why would you ask me
something like that?

42:27.841 --> 42:30.593
Cos you have a reindeer,
and only Santa has reindeer.

42:30.677 --> 42:33.096
Nonsense.
A lot of people have reindeer.

42:33.179 --> 42:35.265
Name five.

42:36.683 --> 42:39.894
Well... most of them
live in Finland.

42:40.311 --> 42:42.397
I can't pronounce their names.

42:45.817 --> 42:49.404
Besides, reindeer are too stupid
to make good pets.

42:49.612 --> 42:52.699
Well, I think you're very smart.

42:57.412 --> 43:00.165
Well, I think he's learning
at an excellent rate.

43:00.248 --> 43:03.751
Oh, really? This morning
he ate a bowl of waxed fruit.

43:03.835 --> 43:05.295
Wait a minute.

43:06.212 --> 43:08.047
I need the
naughty-and-nice list.

43:08.131 --> 43:09.424
No.

43:09.549 --> 43:11.676
It says I'm supposed to
check it twice.

43:11.759 --> 43:14.471
- Santa already checked it.
- No, I didn't.

43:14.554 --> 43:18.099
- The real Santa.
- I am the real Santa!

43:18.183 --> 43:20.185
- I'm sorry?
- I'm in charge here.

43:20.268 --> 43:22.312
- What?
- I check the list twice.

43:22.395 --> 43:24.314
That's the rule.
I like the rules.

43:24.397 --> 43:27.150
- You know how I feel.
- You're misunderstanding.

43:27.233 --> 43:30.779
No, I'm the rule-maker. I like
the rules. Santa likes rules.

43:30.862 --> 43:33.323
I've got a good idea.
How about we have some fun?

43:33.406 --> 43:34.449
Huh?

43:34.699 --> 43:36.868
- It's good to have fun.
- Right.

43:37.035 --> 43:39.871
Santa, look over there.
See those elves?

43:40.205 --> 43:42.916
Go ahead.
Go play some tinsel football.

43:42.999 --> 43:44.459
Break!

43:46.085 --> 43:49.964
- What's the object of tinsel football?
- Come on down.

43:50.465 --> 43:52.801
If you don't have the ball,
get it.

43:52.884 --> 43:56.096
If you have the ball,
run to the end zone.

43:59.766 --> 44:03.645
OK, I'll go get the football.

44:04.813 --> 44:06.397
Ready, hike!

44:12.904 --> 44:15.949
I've got the ball. What are you
gonna do? Who's gonna stop me?

44:16.032 --> 44:17.408
Come on!

44:17.492 --> 44:19.953
This is a lot of fun!

44:24.249 --> 44:26.209
Oh, so sorry!

44:40.557 --> 44:44.060
Come here! Stop! Slow down
when I'm talking to you!

44:44.227 --> 44:46.312
Come here, you! Come on.

44:52.026 --> 44:54.821
He's headed east
toward the main entrance!

45:02.078 --> 45:04.164
Hello, Charlie.

45:06.291 --> 45:08.042
Hello, Principal Newman.

45:09.252 --> 45:10.879
Are Laura and Neil
on their way?

45:10.962 --> 45:12.797
No, I volunteered to go solo.

45:12.881 --> 45:14.507
Oh. You look...

45:15.216 --> 45:17.260
You've lost weight.
Feeling all right?

45:17.343 --> 45:19.429
I was until I got
this phone call.

45:27.145 --> 45:30.440
Charlie, you promised you
weren't gonna do this again.

45:30.523 --> 45:33.443
What's the matter with you?
I'm gonna have to punish ya.

45:33.526 --> 45:35.695
I'll ground him for...
two months.

45:35.779 --> 45:38.323
- I thought you were on my side!
- I'll go one better.

45:38.406 --> 45:40.325
- You're suspended.
- But... Dad!

45:40.408 --> 45:42.952
I'm as upset about
this as you, but isn't there

45:43.036 --> 45:45.914
a punishment that doesn't mean
takin' him out of school?

45:45.997 --> 45:48.625
- What did you have in mind?
- We could...

45:48.708 --> 45:50.460
Uh... ah...

45:50.543 --> 45:52.629
Community service?

45:53.505 --> 45:54.547
Huh.

45:55.173 --> 45:57.258
That's not a bad idea.

45:59.010 --> 46:02.722
OK, Charlie. I want you to
start by cleaning up this wall.

46:02.806 --> 46:05.517
I want everything
off of there by tonight.

46:05.600 --> 46:09.646
And then clean off every mark
off every locker in this hallway.

46:09.729 --> 46:12.273
- Every one?!
- Do as she says, Charlie.

46:12.357 --> 46:14.401
But I have homework,
tests to study for.

46:14.484 --> 46:18.113
Not my problem. I have a
detention group on Saturday.

46:18.196 --> 46:20.407
So we will all get together
at the rec centre

46:20.490 --> 46:22.617
and scrape off graffiti at 8am.

46:22.701 --> 46:24.994
- See you both there.
- You say both of us?

46:25.078 --> 46:28.540
No, l... I'm very busy. I do a
lot of other community service.

46:28.623 --> 46:31.668
That's good. You just got
yourself elected parent rep.

46:31.751 --> 46:35.839
And, Charlie...
We'll talk about the suspension.

46:53.732 --> 46:57.610
Curtis, what is he doing
in the naughty-and-nice centre?

46:59.446 --> 47:02.907
- What's going on?
- I'm checking the naughty-nice list.

47:02.991 --> 47:05.952
- I'm checking it twice.
- I already told you!

47:07.620 --> 47:09.456
It's been checked. Don't worry.

47:09.539 --> 47:11.458
I do worry.
There's a lot of mistakes.

47:11.541 --> 47:13.585
I'll give you
a big fat for instance!

47:13.668 --> 47:16.880
In Denmark, there's a guy
named Sven Halstrom right here.

47:16.963 --> 47:20.717
He's a Dane. He was wiping
his nose on his sister's shirt.

47:20.800 --> 47:25.013
Yuk! That's not very nice!
And yet he's on the nice list.

47:25.096 --> 47:28.475
We try to cut most children
slack this time of year.

47:28.558 --> 47:32.687
I don't understand that!
Kids are misbehaving everywhere.

47:32.771 --> 47:35.357
They're running with scissors.
They're sticky.

47:35.440 --> 47:38.151
"I'm not gonna stop this car!"
"No, we're not there yet!"

47:38.234 --> 47:40.779
"Brush your teeth!"
"Pick up those clothes!"

47:40.862 --> 47:42.947
It goes on and on.

47:43.031 --> 47:46.785
But they're just kids!
Everybody misbehaves some time.

47:46.868 --> 47:49.454
But according to
The Santa Handbook,

47:49.955 --> 47:53.291
naughty kids get lumps of coal
in their stockings. Right?

47:53.375 --> 47:55.502
We will make stockings.

47:55.585 --> 47:59.673
In my opinion, they should all
get coal in their stockings.

48:00.131 --> 48:02.801
- Don't you?
- No! That's not how it works!

48:02.884 --> 48:05.720
Get me the naughty-nice list.
Get me every list!

48:05.804 --> 48:09.265
Get me
everything.

48:09.432 --> 48:11.893
[## Unwritten Law:
Unwritten Christmas]

48:18.108 --> 48:20.527
Mr O'Reilly, Mr Leary.

48:21.027 --> 48:22.988
You in charge of the gangbangers?

48:23.071 --> 48:25.156
They're students,
actually, and yes.

48:25.240 --> 48:27.117
Keep 'em away from the car.
It's new.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.786
I don't need some delinquent
kids scratchin' it up.

48:29.869 --> 48:33.498
They're not delinquents.
And don't worry about your car.

48:33.581 --> 48:36.293
I'd worry about your legs
in those shorts.

48:36.376 --> 48:38.628
I thought only swimmers
shaved their legs!

48:38.712 --> 48:40.463
Whoa, good one!

48:40.547 --> 48:42.048
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

48:42.132 --> 48:44.467
- Brought you coffee.
- Thank you.

48:45.760 --> 48:49.431
- So you have a nice-guy side.
- I'm a man of many sides.

48:49.806 --> 48:52.809
I'm a puzzle.
I'm a Rubik's Cube with pants.

48:52.934 --> 48:55.228
- A laugh! Actual laugh.

48:55.312 --> 48:58.273
- Dad, it doesn't come off.
- It's not supposed to come off.

48:58.356 --> 49:00.692
Hence you've got to be
careful where you put it.

49:00.775 --> 49:04.446
Hence tagging is serious.
Hence your presence here.

49:04.946 --> 49:08.116
Don't say "hence" any more, Dad.
It's really annoying.

49:10.827 --> 49:12.662
Nicely done!

49:12.746 --> 49:17.167
How do you do it? I have trouble
with one. You have hundreds.

49:18.251 --> 49:20.503
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:21.046 --> 49:23.590
- I was really good this year.

49:23.673 --> 49:27.677
Is that so? Are you absolutely
sure about that, Pamela?

49:27.761 --> 49:30.680
I want a doll house
and a swimming pool.

49:31.097 --> 49:32.891
A swimming pool?

49:32.974 --> 49:35.185
I'm sorry. She insisted
on talking to you.

49:35.268 --> 49:37.771
- It's not a problem.
- OK.

49:37.979 --> 49:42.734
I'll tell you what. If you can
promise me you'll be good,

49:42.817 --> 49:45.278
I can guarantee
you'll have a great Christmas.

49:45.362 --> 49:48.073
- OK! Yeah!
- Come on.

49:54.955 --> 49:57.332
Kids get so nutty
this time of year.

49:57.707 --> 50:00.418
- Is she a neighbour?
- No.

50:00.502 --> 50:02.462
Oh. How did you know her name?

50:02.546 --> 50:04.756
Oh, the... necklace,
it said Pamela on it.

50:04.839 --> 50:08.593
Oh, I guess I missed that. I'm
gonna go check on this group.

50:14.349 --> 50:16.434
You cost me, Pamela.

50:18.812 --> 50:22.107
I just couldn't sleep
thinking about all those rules.

50:22.190 --> 50:24.776
Am I wrong? Am I right?
Does it matter?

50:24.901 --> 50:27.779
Couldn't have been the three
gallons of cocoa I had!

50:27.863 --> 50:31.700
But you understand rules, don't
you? You're highly decorated.

50:31.783 --> 50:34.202
And look at that face.
There you go.

50:34.452 --> 50:36.746
There's a face
only a mom would like.

50:36.830 --> 50:39.958
I don't have a mom,
so I wouldn't know about that.

50:40.041 --> 50:42.294
Now, it's time
for the big event.

50:43.503 --> 50:45.380
Guess what?

50:45.881 --> 50:48.049
Son, it's show time!

50:48.633 --> 50:51.052
You're in the spotlight.
Get bigger with it.

50:51.136 --> 50:54.014
It's your big chance.
I need a little help.

50:54.097 --> 50:57.184
I need a little muscle.
I need a little nudge.

50:57.350 --> 50:59.728
Let's call yourself
the little nudge!

50:59.811 --> 51:03.773
This won't hurt - except for the
electric shock through you.

51:03.857 --> 51:05.525
See ya on the other side!

51:27.839 --> 51:30.050
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi. Uh...

51:30.467 --> 51:32.344
It looks like you're going out.

51:32.427 --> 51:35.180
- Sorry. I should have called.
- No, it's OK. Come in.

51:35.263 --> 51:36.932
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

51:42.687 --> 51:45.148
- Is there a problem?
- No, no. I just...

51:45.232 --> 51:47.192
I wondered if, um...

51:48.026 --> 51:49.945
If you would...

51:50.821 --> 51:53.532
Do you want to go
get some noodles?

51:55.492 --> 51:57.202
Or pie?

51:57.285 --> 51:59.704
But I don't want to
keep you from your date, so...

51:59.788 --> 52:03.041
Oh, it's not a date. It's the
faculty Christmas party.

52:04.709 --> 52:07.379
Is that your idea of
a night on the town?

52:07.712 --> 52:09.631
Noodles and pie?

52:09.923 --> 52:12.759
- Yes. What would be your idea?
- Pizza and a movie.

52:12.843 --> 52:14.511
- Thick or thin crust?
- Thin.

52:14.594 --> 52:16.263
Good! Movie?

52:16.513 --> 52:19.141
Two For The Road.
Audrey Hepburn, Albert Finney.

52:19.224 --> 52:22.394
Movie's OK, but the car
was the star. '53 MGTD.

52:22.644 --> 52:24.938
Racing green, wire wheels...
Beautiful.

52:25.021 --> 52:28.358
I'm impressed. That is
a great car. My favourite car.

52:28.441 --> 52:30.360
Didn't like driving 'em
in the rain.

52:30.485 --> 52:33.947
You have to push it to start it.
Other than that it's perfect.

52:34.656 --> 52:36.741
It's perfect, though.

52:39.828 --> 52:42.664
- I could drive you to your party.
- That would be great.

52:42.747 --> 52:46.168
Except for, eventually,
I'm going to have to get home.

52:46.251 --> 52:49.421
Well, l... I could pick you up.

52:49.588 --> 52:53.175
So you're going to drop me off,
then come back and pick me up?

52:53.258 --> 52:55.135
- Yeah.
- Why don't you just stay?

52:55.218 --> 52:58.054
- All right, I'll stay.
- I'll get my coat.

52:58.555 --> 53:01.224
So, Mr Andretti,
what are you driving?

53:01.349 --> 53:04.436
You know...
I think you're gonna like it.

53:35.884 --> 53:37.803
Mind if I ask you
something personal?

53:37.886 --> 53:39.429
Please.

53:39.513 --> 53:42.140
- You look really different.
- The weight.

53:42.224 --> 53:46.186
It's lndian teas and it's a lot
of salves and stuff. It's...

53:46.269 --> 53:48.438
- Do you want some cocoa?
- Uh, yes.

53:49.106 --> 53:51.566
Cocoa.
You have thought of everything.

53:51.650 --> 53:54.986
Well, this time of year,
l... I really shine.

53:55.487 --> 53:57.697
Yeah, I can't wait
till it's over, though.

53:57.781 --> 54:00.033
Streets are crowded,
the malls are jammed,

54:00.117 --> 54:03.203
people max out their credit cards...
It's noisy.

54:03.620 --> 54:05.372
When did you become
such a cynic?

54:05.455 --> 54:07.999
Oh. I don't know.

54:09.084 --> 54:11.169
I used to love Christmas, too.

54:11.294 --> 54:14.631
It was the only day
that my parents didn't fight.

54:16.049 --> 54:17.092
- Oh.
- Oh.

54:18.218 --> 54:20.387
They were at each other
all the time.

54:20.470 --> 54:24.349
But on Christmas, they tried
to make the holiday special.

54:24.433 --> 54:28.061
My dad went through this charade
so I'd believe in Santa Claus.

54:28.145 --> 54:31.773
He put a cot by the fireplace
so Santa could take a nap...

54:31.857 --> 54:33.775
Like he has time to take a nap!

54:33.859 --> 54:37.320
Consider the amount of gifts
he would have to... deliver.

54:37.404 --> 54:40.240
Why would he nap? He
would probably need some coffee.

54:40.323 --> 54:43.785
Yeah. And there was
cocoa and cookies.

54:44.536 --> 54:46.621
And carrots for the reindeer.

54:47.122 --> 54:49.750
That's a good gesture.
The reindeer love carrots.

54:49.833 --> 54:52.127
And the thought is
important to them, too.

54:52.210 --> 54:57.132
Yeah. And I'd wake up and the cocoa
and cookies would be gone

54:57.215 --> 55:00.635
and the cot would be mussed
and the carrots gnawed.

55:00.719 --> 55:04.473
They swallow them. If they're
fresh they'll eat 'em like that.

55:04.556 --> 55:06.641
They love red bell peppers, too.

55:06.725 --> 55:08.727
You know the stories.
If you read...

55:10.687 --> 55:14.524
And there would be incredible
presents under the tree.

55:14.941 --> 55:18.445
One year was a rocking horse,
and I named it Harvey.

55:18.987 --> 55:21.615
And the next year was
a little red wagon,

55:21.698 --> 55:24.576
which I made a lemonade stand,
which was great.

55:24.659 --> 55:26.411
And the last year was...

55:27.412 --> 55:32.084
It was just... a Baby Doll. She was
pink and soft and beautiful.

55:33.627 --> 55:36.088
- Beautiful?
- Yes.

55:38.006 --> 55:40.676
I believed in Santa so much
I'd get in fights at school

55:40.759 --> 55:43.303
with kids who tried to tell me
that he didn't exist.

55:43.387 --> 55:46.223
And one day
I came home with a bloody nose.

55:46.431 --> 55:49.685
That's when my parents
decided to tell me to...

55:49.851 --> 55:51.770
grow up.

55:51.937 --> 55:54.064
I was devastated, and...

55:55.524 --> 55:59.194
Good, Carol! This is great
sleigh-riding conversation!

55:59.277 --> 56:03.156
- I'm a terrible sleigh con-..
- It's fine conversation.

56:03.240 --> 56:06.743
A person just wants something
to believe in, you know?

56:06.827 --> 56:09.329
Yes, I know. Yes, I know.

56:10.872 --> 56:12.791
OK, we have cocoa.

56:12.874 --> 56:15.460
We have a blanket.
We have a horse-drawn sleigh.

56:15.544 --> 56:17.379
The only thing that's...

56:20.173 --> 56:21.800
- What?

56:21.883 --> 56:23.468
- It's snowing.
- Oh.

56:23.969 --> 56:25.512
As if by magic?

56:25.595 --> 56:28.682
That's what I was gonna say,
that it should be snowing!

## Holiday

56:45.365 --> 56:49.369
## Since you've been gone

## Oh, my darling

## Holiday...

I owe you one.

57:15.729 --> 57:17.564
It's a great party.

57:18.523 --> 57:20.901
Look. That guy moved.

57:22.402 --> 57:25.280
- Would you excuse me?
- Mm-hm.

57:42.172 --> 57:45.050
Could I have your attention?
Your attention, please!

57:46.468 --> 57:51.306
There we go. Hi. I'm Scott Calvin and
I just thought I'd step up here and...

57:51.390 --> 57:54.977
and say the word that we've all
been longing to hear.

57:56.019 --> 57:57.688
Fire!

58:01.400 --> 58:04.820
OK. What I think, folks, is
that a lot of you have forgotten

58:04.903 --> 58:07.698
what the true spirit
of Christmas is all about.

58:07.781 --> 58:08.824
Mm?

58:08.949 --> 58:11.493
If you're not willing
to dance or laugh or flirt

58:11.576 --> 58:15.038
or risk the buffet, I don't
think we have much choice.

58:15.122 --> 58:18.500
So before the choir gets out
here I say we rock this house

58:18.584 --> 58:21.211
with a secret Santa! Huh?

58:22.462 --> 58:24.256
Carol - happy, happy Christmas!

58:24.339 --> 58:28.010
I think they're just
decorations for the carollers.

58:28.302 --> 58:31.263
She's afraid these are
decorations for the carolling.

58:31.346 --> 58:34.224
I think Carol is right
about the carolling!

58:34.308 --> 58:37.894
I'm talking about the packages
that are backstage.

58:37.978 --> 58:40.188
There aren't any
packages backstage.

58:40.272 --> 58:42.357
Ohh! There's none back there.

58:42.524 --> 58:46.320
So I was mistaken
when I saw this bag of gifts.

58:46.403 --> 58:49.531
Maybe I'm wrong, but it sure
looks like a bag of gifts.

58:49.615 --> 58:51.783
Ohh! It's heavy
like a bag of gifts.

58:52.576 --> 58:55.203
Look at this! What's in here?

58:58.165 --> 59:00.250
It's very heavy, very heavy.

59:02.210 --> 59:03.879
John Pierce.

59:04.463 --> 59:06.548
Doesn't your mom call you JJ?

59:08.926 --> 59:11.011
Merry Christmas, JJ.

59:20.771 --> 59:22.856
No way.

59:23.982 --> 59:25.400
This is Toss Across!

59:26.360 --> 59:28.320
I used to love this
when I was a kid!

59:29.529 --> 59:31.281
But I never told anybody.

59:31.573 --> 59:33.951
Where did...? Who did this?

59:36.119 --> 59:37.704
Grace Kim.

59:39.164 --> 59:41.291
Yes, there you are!
Merry Christmas.

59:41.375 --> 59:43.043
- Thank you.
- Tom Astle.

59:43.168 --> 59:44.962
- Me! Sorry, Gordon.
- Hey!

59:45.045 --> 59:47.714
- Haven't changed a bit!
- Gee, thanks.

59:48.090 --> 59:49.675
- Lizzy Garcia.
- Here.

59:50.259 --> 59:53.845
- There. Merry Christmas.
- Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots!

59:53.929 --> 59:56.181
Mint condition!
This is incredible!

59:56.265 --> 59:58.350
The Holly Hobbie Oven!

01:00:02.813 --> 01:00:05.816
Come on up and get
the rest of your presents.

01:00:06.024 --> 01:00:07.776
- Marie?
- Here!

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:10.946
There she is. Katie. Jerry.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.657
- Here!
- Cory. Cory?

01:00:13.782 --> 01:00:15.450
Here!

01:00:19.705 --> 01:00:21.790
[## Chuck Berry:
Run Rudolph Run]

01:00:56.325 --> 01:00:58.660
- Carl, you need a net.
- Not me!

01:00:59.703 --> 01:01:01.788
This is great.

01:01:04.416 --> 01:01:06.335
Hey, party animal,
you want to play?

01:01:06.418 --> 01:01:09.129
- I can't figure it out.
- It's beanbag tic-tac-toe.

01:01:09.213 --> 01:01:11.381
No, I mean
the secret Santa thing.

01:01:11.465 --> 01:01:14.510
Someone tracked down all those
wonderful antique toys.

01:01:14.593 --> 01:01:16.970
Probably someone who knows
his way around eBay.

01:01:17.054 --> 01:01:18.639
- Yeah.
- Yep.

01:01:18.847 --> 01:01:20.766
It was you. I know it was you.

01:01:21.642 --> 01:01:24.645
I just can't figure out...
How did you do it?

01:01:24.812 --> 01:01:27.648
Sometimes you don't need
to know all the answers.

01:01:27.731 --> 01:01:29.233
Speaking of which...

01:01:29.983 --> 01:01:32.277
Even the principal
needs a Christmas gift.

01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:33.987
Merry Christmas.

01:01:34.488 --> 01:01:36.406
Come on, open it. Rip it open.

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:39.034
Come on.
We're not gonna save the paper.

01:02:02.558 --> 01:02:04.893
It's Baby Doll.

01:02:10.899 --> 01:02:12.985
Come here.

01:02:14.486 --> 01:02:16.321
- Did you call the office?
- No.

01:02:16.405 --> 01:02:18.407
- Did they call you?
- It's not like that.

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:21.243
- Did you investigate us?
- No, I wouldn't do that.

01:02:21.326 --> 01:02:25.247
Did you...? I told you about
Baby Doll an hour ago, and...

01:02:25.706 --> 01:02:27.374
Did you send someone to...?

01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:29.209
- No.
- No.

01:02:29.585 --> 01:02:33.005
Well... I don't know
how you did it.

01:02:34.131 --> 01:02:36.133
It's like some kind of magic.

01:02:36.717 --> 01:02:39.094
Yeah, sort of like
some kind of magic.

01:02:39.178 --> 01:02:42.931
And... and pretty much
the last that I have.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.811
What? Well, what...?
You know what?

01:02:48.187 --> 01:02:50.063
I don't want to know.

01:02:50.355 --> 01:02:54.193
What you did in there tonight
for everyone was wonderful.

01:02:54.276 --> 01:02:56.361
Thank you.

01:03:01.241 --> 01:03:02.701
I'm sorry.

01:03:03.869 --> 01:03:05.829
I shouldn't have done that.

01:03:08.332 --> 01:03:10.793
- Is that OK?
- Yeah.

01:03:12.544 --> 01:03:15.589
Got this weird feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

01:03:17.216 --> 01:03:18.884
I'm, um...

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:24.139
I'm not...
real good at this.

01:03:42.116 --> 01:03:43.826
Where did that come from?

01:03:43.909 --> 01:03:45.994
I don't know.

01:03:59.007 --> 01:04:01.093
Hi! Merry Christmas!

01:04:01.176 --> 01:04:02.678
Ho, ho, ho!

01:04:09.977 --> 01:04:11.812
Can I have your attention?

01:04:12.229 --> 01:04:15.566
Stop the work, please.
Everybody stop the work.

01:04:15.691 --> 01:04:17.568
- Merry Christmas!

01:04:17.651 --> 01:04:21.155
That's nice. I have a little
announcement to make.

01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:25.701
From this moment forward, we're
not gonna make any more toys.

01:04:25.784 --> 01:04:28.537
The children of the world
don't deserve presents.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.789
They're running rampant
with naughtiness.

01:04:30.873 --> 01:04:33.792
This Christmas we're gonna
give those greedy kids

01:04:33.876 --> 01:04:36.754
exactly what they deserve.

01:04:37.629 --> 01:04:42.843
A beautiful, high-quality
yet low-sulphur variety of coal!

01:04:45.888 --> 01:04:47.264
Quiet!

01:04:49.099 --> 01:04:52.353
We have to focus,
all of us, on the goals ahead.

01:04:53.187 --> 01:04:56.273
And just to make sure
that that happens...

01:04:57.274 --> 01:04:59.109
Thank you, sweetie.

01:05:00.277 --> 01:05:03.072
I... I hate to blow my own horn.

01:05:16.335 --> 01:05:18.253
Stay where you are!
Don't be afraid!

01:05:23.175 --> 01:05:24.551
Back! Back!

01:05:25.135 --> 01:05:27.805
I was up late, couldn't sleep.

01:05:27.888 --> 01:05:30.140
Milk wouldn't do it,
cocoa is a little sweet,

01:05:30.224 --> 01:05:33.310
so I decided to make
an army of toy soldiers.

01:05:34.812 --> 01:05:37.606
They don't have
a good sense of humour like me.

01:05:40.651 --> 01:05:44.571
I would do what they ask you.
Which is what I'm going to tell you!

01:05:44.655 --> 01:05:47.574
Don't listen to him!
This guy's not Santa!

01:05:47.741 --> 01:05:49.743
- He's not Santa?
- He's a toy!

01:05:50.828 --> 01:05:53.580
He has a rubber face
and a plastic tushy!

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:00.713
Trust me!
Don't let him ruin Christmas!

01:06:01.005 --> 01:06:03.716
Thank you for
those kind words, Bernard!

01:06:03.799 --> 01:06:06.677
Well, now that we all
have an understanding,

01:06:07.928 --> 01:06:11.724
have a joyous and
merry Christmas!

01:06:15.978 --> 01:06:18.022
Merry Christmas!

01:06:25.612 --> 01:06:27.114
OK, ready? Go!

01:06:28.324 --> 01:06:30.743
This is what I call
community service!

01:06:30.826 --> 01:06:32.911
Here she comes. Duck down!

01:06:34.246 --> 01:06:35.497
Hey!

01:06:35.581 --> 01:06:37.916
Attention you hooligans
behind that snow bank!

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.336
You have snowballed
the wrong house.

01:06:40.419 --> 01:06:44.173
Drop the snowballs, kick them
away from the snow suits

01:06:44.256 --> 01:06:46.550
and keep the mittens
where I can see them.

01:06:46.634 --> 01:06:49.428
Your dad is hanging with
Principal Newman?

01:06:49.511 --> 01:06:51.096
- Is he dating her?
- No.

01:06:52.181 --> 01:06:55.351
Go to your homes.
Uh... pelt the ones you love.

01:06:55.851 --> 01:06:58.270
- And a merry Christmas!

01:06:58.354 --> 01:07:01.190
- That is really gross, man.
- Shut up.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.957
There are things about me you
should know. Personal things.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.542
We don't need to
rush things, Scott.

01:07:21.001 --> 01:07:23.462
I think you need to
know these things.

01:07:23.545 --> 01:07:24.588
OK.

01:07:24.672 --> 01:07:26.298
Um...

01:07:30.052 --> 01:07:32.471
Remember the mistletoe,
how it just showed up?

01:07:32.554 --> 01:07:34.431
- Yes.
- And the sleigh.

01:07:34.515 --> 01:07:36.517
- How magical that was?
- Yes.

01:07:36.809 --> 01:07:38.769
Secret Santa Claus?

01:07:39.103 --> 01:07:41.188
- That was me.
- Yeah?

01:07:44.149 --> 01:07:47.695
I'm not this size much. I'm
usually much bigger than this.

01:07:47.778 --> 01:07:49.530
So am I sometimes.

01:07:49.613 --> 01:07:51.824
I have a big white beard
that's beautiful.

01:07:51.907 --> 01:07:54.493
- I don't.
- I work a long way from home.

01:07:54.743 --> 01:07:57.079
When I get back home,
I sleep for a long time.

01:07:57.162 --> 01:07:59.873
See? OK.
It's not so bad so far.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.668
You work far away from home
and you sleep a lot.

01:08:02.751 --> 01:08:06.338
You've never been to prison
and you don't wear socks with sandals.

01:08:06.422 --> 01:08:07.631
Well...

01:08:10.175 --> 01:08:12.011
I'm Santa Claus.

01:08:12.428 --> 01:08:13.804
What?

01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:17.933
The suit, the red suit's real.
The North Pole is a place.

01:08:18.017 --> 01:08:22.604
There are elves. They make toys.
They're beautiful and it's real.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:24.607
- I exist.
- That's not funny.

01:08:24.689 --> 01:08:26.149
- It's magical.
- Cut it out.

01:08:26.233 --> 01:08:27.734
I'm telling the truth.

01:08:27.818 --> 01:08:30.112
I told you something personal
from my childhood

01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:33.948
and now you're making a joke
out of it and it's not funny. It hurts.

01:08:34.033 --> 01:08:38.996
I know how hard this is to
believe, but connect the dots.

01:08:39.078 --> 01:08:41.749
- Think what's happened.
- I know what's going on.

01:08:41.832 --> 01:08:45.044
- Think about the little girl.
- You felt something for me.

01:08:45.127 --> 01:08:48.339
Now you're acting like a mental
patient because you're scared.

01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:52.051
- I deliver gifts in a sleigh.
- lncredible.

01:08:52.134 --> 01:08:55.595
I go down chimneys with burning
logs and I still deliver gifts.

01:08:55.679 --> 01:08:57.723
I'm not scared.
That's not what this is.

01:08:57.805 --> 01:09:00.184
If you're trying to
push me away, it's working.

01:09:00.267 --> 01:09:02.102
Carol, don't make me leave.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.647
Please.

01:09:33.466 --> 01:09:35.426
- How could you pick her?
- I didn't.

01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:36.929
You don't care any more.

01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:39.180
I care more about you
than anybody.

01:09:39.265 --> 01:09:41.100
But it's a two-way street.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:44.770
- You won't confide in me.
- You want it? Here it is.

01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:47.939
- What? Talk to me.
- I don't live a normal life.

01:09:48.023 --> 01:09:50.609
- You live a great life here.
- Just listen to me!

01:09:50.693 --> 01:09:53.654
My friends get to go around
saying, "My dad's a plumber."

01:09:53.737 --> 01:09:56.782
"My dad's a pilot." "My dad's
a dentist." You know what?

01:09:56.866 --> 01:10:00.452
My dad is the best thing of all
and I can't tell anyone.

01:10:02.288 --> 01:10:06.542
You have no idea how hard it is,
walking around with that secret.

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:09.879
And now you're going out
with Principal Newman!

01:10:09.962 --> 01:10:12.214
And you don't even
tell me about it.

01:10:12.298 --> 01:10:15.718
My whole life has become
about secrets, and I hate it!

01:10:19.972 --> 01:10:22.057
I'm sorry.

01:10:24.059 --> 01:10:26.395
Forget about
Principal Newman, all right?

01:10:26.479 --> 01:10:28.606
And forget about Santa.
I'm done.

01:10:31.192 --> 01:10:32.985
My time's up.

01:10:33.486 --> 01:10:35.905
Who cares any more?

01:10:41.327 --> 01:10:43.662
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Lucy.

01:10:44.079 --> 01:10:46.499
- What are you doing?
- Just shovelling.

01:10:46.582 --> 01:10:47.625
Oh.

01:10:48.042 --> 01:10:50.628
Charlie, is Uncle Scott
Santa Claus?

01:10:51.462 --> 01:10:53.255
No.
Why would you think that?

01:10:53.339 --> 01:10:55.299
I don't know.

01:10:55.591 --> 01:10:59.553
- How come Uncle Scott was sad?
- What makes you think that?

01:10:59.637 --> 01:11:01.680
I asked him to stick
a straw in his nose

01:11:01.764 --> 01:11:03.724
and blow bubbles
in his milk.

01:11:03.808 --> 01:11:06.227
- And he said no.
- Whatever.

01:11:07.144 --> 01:11:09.980
- Can you talk to him?
- I don't think so, Lucy.

01:11:10.064 --> 01:11:12.233
- Did you have a fight?
- Sort of.

01:11:12.316 --> 01:11:14.193
- Are you gonna make up?
- I don't know!

01:11:14.276 --> 01:11:16.403
- Are you gonna be mad forever?
- Lucy!

01:11:16.487 --> 01:11:18.697
- What?
- These are hard questions.

01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:20.533
No, they're not. They're easy.

01:11:20.616 --> 01:11:23.119
And you can't be mad
at him forever, Charlie.

01:11:23.202 --> 01:11:25.371
He's your daddy
and you love him.

01:11:34.505 --> 01:11:36.757
## Dashing through the snow

01:11:36.841 --> 01:11:39.718
## In a strip-mining machine

01:11:39.802 --> 01:11:41.387
## Flatten the hills we go

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.222
Come on!

01:11:43.389 --> 01:11:46.058
Put a smile on that face,
little troll!

01:11:46.267 --> 01:11:49.270
Wait a minute. I got a joke.
This'll cheer you up.

01:11:50.396 --> 01:11:52.148
- Knock, knock!
- Who's there?

01:11:54.066 --> 01:11:55.818
- Aren't you?
- Aren't you who?

01:11:55.901 --> 01:11:58.112
Aren't you supposed to
get back to work?!

01:11:58.195 --> 01:12:01.115
All of ya! You little idiots!
Back to work!

01:12:01.991 --> 01:12:04.076
Got any twos?

01:12:05.244 --> 01:12:06.704
Hm.

01:12:07.955 --> 01:12:10.040
Go fish.

01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:14.462
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:12:14.837 --> 01:12:16.922
Whooaahh!

01:12:18.966 --> 01:12:21.051
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:12:23.095 --> 01:12:25.222
- Want some more hot chocolate?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:25.306 --> 01:12:26.766
OK.

01:12:28.934 --> 01:12:31.395
- Would you get that, honey?
- Yeah, sure.

01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:37.359
Is S... Scott here?

01:12:37.777 --> 01:12:39.779
- Who are you?
- Uh...

01:12:39.862 --> 01:12:41.947
Curtis, a friend from...
Buffalo.

01:12:43.657 --> 01:12:45.826
- Are you an elf?
- Of course not!

01:12:46.035 --> 01:12:48.162
Why would you ask
such a silly question?

01:12:48.245 --> 01:12:50.122
How come you have pointy ears?

01:12:51.624 --> 01:12:55.252
It's... because I never
ate my green vegetables.

01:12:56.212 --> 01:12:59.382
Do you eat
your green vegetables?

01:13:02.051 --> 01:13:04.095
Uncle Scott!

01:13:04.345 --> 01:13:06.847
Yeah, I'm right here.
What's wrong?

01:13:07.306 --> 01:13:09.558
Oh... Curtis! What are you doin' here?

01:13:09.642 --> 01:13:11.727
There's a little
trouble at the...

01:13:11.811 --> 01:13:13.354
plant.

01:13:14.355 --> 01:13:16.148
It's OK.
Curtis is a very old friend.

01:13:16.232 --> 01:13:19.026
We have a large, uh... firm.
We work together in...

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:20.778
- Buffalo.
- Buffalo?

01:13:22.738 --> 01:13:26.492
We work together in Buffalo.
So... we're gonna talk business.

01:13:26.575 --> 01:13:29.662
- What business?
- It's none of your business.

01:13:29.745 --> 01:13:32.873
Soon I'm gonna be seven.
And then I can know things.

01:13:32.957 --> 01:13:34.875
- Good night, Curtis.
- Good night, Lucy.

01:13:34.959 --> 01:13:36.711
Good night, Lucy.

01:13:36.794 --> 01:13:39.463
- What's up?
- Toy Santa's out of control.

01:13:39.547 --> 01:13:42.174
He's locked up the elves,
shut down the workshop,

01:13:42.258 --> 01:13:45.511
he thinks everybody's naughty
and he's gonna give everyone coal!

01:13:45.594 --> 01:13:48.514
- Why didn't Bernard tell me?
- He's under house arrest.

01:13:48.597 --> 01:13:49.682
Bernard?!

01:13:49.765 --> 01:13:52.977
Fly back with me to the North
Pole to save Christmas!

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.813
I can't. I have no magic left.
I'm out of magic. Look.

01:13:55.896 --> 01:13:57.314
Grrrr!

01:13:59.442 --> 01:14:02.653
- I thought you had Comet.
- Yeah, we...

01:14:03.195 --> 01:14:04.947
Yes! Come on!

01:14:05.906 --> 01:14:07.992
Hey, Comet. We just...

01:14:11.162 --> 01:14:12.830
Comet?

01:14:13.622 --> 01:14:15.291
Comet?

01:14:17.543 --> 01:14:19.086
Look at me.

01:14:20.379 --> 01:14:22.340
- Comet...!

01:14:23.883 --> 01:14:25.760
What are ya doin'?

01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:28.846
- Eating sugar is bad for you.

01:14:30.431 --> 01:14:32.850
What do you mean,
you didn't eat this?

01:14:34.018 --> 01:14:35.895
Who did?

01:14:36.354 --> 01:14:38.189
A squirrel?!

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.443
Get this. You gotta fly both
of us back to the North Pole.

01:14:43.736 --> 01:14:45.655
- Yeah, tonight.

01:14:46.822 --> 01:14:48.824
OK. I'll help you up.

01:14:48.908 --> 01:14:51.786
All right? Ready? You've got to
help me a little here.

01:14:53.537 --> 01:14:54.997
Pull.

01:14:55.122 --> 01:14:56.165
Ai! Gah!

01:14:57.166 --> 01:15:00.127
Good. OK, we almost got it.

01:15:00.294 --> 01:15:01.796
That's OK.

01:15:02.963 --> 01:15:06.676
OK, now, help me.
Can ya move anything?

01:15:14.558 --> 01:15:17.061
Fire in the hole! Get away!

01:15:21.023 --> 01:15:22.066
Whoa!

01:15:22.566 --> 01:15:24.568
Eat some roughage, will you?

01:15:25.653 --> 01:15:30.116
- Oh, what about the jet pack?
- It burned up on reentry.

01:15:32.618 --> 01:15:35.705
What am I supposed to do?
Grow wings?

01:15:38.916 --> 01:15:42.336
I hope he doesn't have
too many stops to make tonight.

01:15:43.921 --> 01:15:47.925
You and me both, pal.
OK. Let's just get it over with.

01:15:49.051 --> 01:15:50.094
OK.

01:15:50.386 --> 01:15:52.221
One, two...

01:15:54.056 --> 01:15:55.308
Three!

01:15:57.977 --> 01:16:01.022
- What's going on down there?
- Are you sure about this?

01:16:01.105 --> 01:16:03.107
What? The old toaster trick?

01:16:03.357 --> 01:16:06.944
When we were kids we used to do
this to get a little extra cash.

01:16:07.028 --> 01:16:09.780
- Works every time!
- I can't watch this.

01:16:10.239 --> 01:16:13.242
- You ready, buddy?
- All right. Let her rip.

01:16:13.659 --> 01:16:14.702
One,

01:16:14.827 --> 01:16:15.870
two,

01:16:16.621 --> 01:16:18.205
three!

01:16:19.248 --> 01:16:20.458
Ow!

01:16:23.919 --> 01:16:25.546
Oh, Scott!

01:16:26.964 --> 01:16:29.216
- Scott, are you all right?
- Mom!

01:16:30.384 --> 01:16:32.386
- Yes?
- I lost another tooth.

01:16:32.637 --> 01:16:34.805
Should I put it
under my pillow?

01:16:35.139 --> 01:16:36.641
Yes!

01:17:06.921 --> 01:17:07.964
By cuspids!

01:17:08.839 --> 01:17:09.882
Shhh.

01:17:10.007 --> 01:17:11.717
This way. Come on.

01:17:11.801 --> 01:17:14.637
Curtis, get the door.
It's a Tooth Fairy ambush.

01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:23.271
What do you people want?
I only carry $20 in change.

01:17:23.354 --> 01:17:25.356
Tooth Fairy, it's me, Santa.

01:17:25.481 --> 01:17:27.692
I've lost the weight
and the beard, but it's me.

01:17:27.775 --> 01:17:30.736
I know Santa. Santa is a friend.
And you, sir, are no Santa.

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.029
I am too.

01:17:32.113 --> 01:17:35.950
How did I know I could capture
you by holdin' on to a wing?

01:17:36.033 --> 01:17:39.161
You wanted to change your name
to Captain Floss or Plaque Man.

01:17:39.245 --> 01:17:40.913
Or, as I recall, Roy.

01:17:40.997 --> 01:17:44.250
And it was Santa's idea
to call you the Molarnator.

01:17:46.252 --> 01:17:49.297
- Who's the kid?
- One of my elves. He's an elf.

01:17:50.006 --> 01:17:51.048
Ow.

01:17:51.966 --> 01:17:53.634
Santa!

01:17:55.887 --> 01:17:57.638
The Molarnator at your service!

01:17:59.056 --> 01:18:01.559
- A little altitude, please!
- What?

01:18:01.893 --> 01:18:04.353
Could you possibly
fly a little higher?

01:18:04.437 --> 01:18:05.479
Oof!

01:18:05.688 --> 01:18:08.900
- What?
- Never mind!

01:18:17.617 --> 01:18:19.410
Principal Newman?

01:18:20.411 --> 01:18:22.371
What is it, Charlie?

01:18:23.247 --> 01:18:26.876
You keep asking me if there's
something bothering me.

01:18:26.959 --> 01:18:29.045
Well, there is. I...

01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:32.173
I couldn't talk
about it before, but...

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:35.551
I want to talk about it now.

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:38.304
OK. Go ahead.

01:18:39.013 --> 01:18:42.099
- My dad is Santa.
- Oh, please. Not you too.

01:18:42.183 --> 01:18:43.851
Hold on.

01:18:44.268 --> 01:18:47.230
If you have no feelings
for my dad, then fine.

01:18:47.313 --> 01:18:49.690
But if the only reason
for not being with him is

01:18:49.774 --> 01:18:52.860
that you don't believe in him,
you're making a big mistake.

01:18:52.944 --> 01:18:54.487
Oh, Charlie...

01:18:54.695 --> 01:18:56.364
Here.

01:18:59.116 --> 01:19:02.245
I want you to take this.
Look into this and...

01:19:02.495 --> 01:19:05.289
try to remember what it was like
when you were little

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:07.917
and you still
believed in Christmas.

01:19:32.525 --> 01:19:35.611
Seeing isn't believing.
Believing is seeing.

01:19:38.239 --> 01:19:40.449
You haven't seen anything yet!

01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:46.372
- Curtis?
- What? Ow!

01:19:46.789 --> 01:19:48.457
- What do I do?
- Slow down.

01:19:48.541 --> 01:19:49.584
OK.

01:19:49.917 --> 01:19:52.128
Piece of cake. Attaboy.
There you go.

01:19:52.211 --> 01:19:53.963
Why can't you fly higher?

01:19:54.881 --> 01:19:58.050
Tooth Fairy, I want to thank
you. I'll never forget this.

01:19:58.134 --> 01:19:59.927
I wish I could do more,
but I gotta go.

01:20:00.011 --> 01:20:02.388
Denver just started
a new pee-wee hockey league.

01:20:02.472 --> 01:20:04.640
Before you go,
I want you to know that nobody,

01:20:04.724 --> 01:20:07.351
nobody was
braver than you were today.

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:09.770
You should be
proud of your wings.

01:20:10.313 --> 01:20:12.440
- They're not too girly?
- Not on you.

01:20:21.824 --> 01:20:24.285
Wouldn't it be easier
to go through the workshop?

01:20:24.368 --> 01:20:27.497
No. That way Santa and his
soldiers would be expecting us.

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:31.083
Sound military strategy involves
taking your enemy by surprise.

01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:33.252
It's good strategy.

01:20:35.421 --> 01:20:38.549
Sometimes being a despot
is a tough business.

01:20:40.259 --> 01:20:41.302
Come on.

01:20:46.849 --> 01:20:48.976
It's Scott, isn't it?

01:20:49.227 --> 01:20:51.270
Yeah. What are you
supposed to be?

01:20:51.354 --> 01:20:54.774
A better, stronger version
of what you used to be -

01:20:55.441 --> 01:20:57.527
with a flawless complexion,
I might add.

01:20:57.610 --> 01:21:01.155
- Look, it just glistens.
- Listen to me. I'm back now.

01:21:01.239 --> 01:21:04.408
So untie us. Let the elves go
and give me back the coat.

01:21:09.705 --> 01:21:13.251
No can do! It's Christmas Eve!
I have coal to deliver!

01:21:13.334 --> 01:21:16.129
And I don't want those
naughty kids to suffer!

01:21:16.212 --> 01:21:18.923
Boys! One, two, three!

01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:21.717
And... one, two!

01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:24.220
Try to keep up!
Let's go. Move it on!

01:21:24.887 --> 01:21:27.140
Try to...
This is just too tight.

01:21:29.225 --> 01:21:31.144
This is all my fault.

01:21:31.352 --> 01:21:33.813
I thought I could
create another Santa.

01:21:33.896 --> 01:21:37.066
My elfin pride
blinded me to all reason.

01:21:38.192 --> 01:21:40.278
There's only one Santa.

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:42.697
Well, I've done
a pretty rotten job.

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:44.574
I didn't check the list twice.

01:21:44.657 --> 01:21:47.160
My kid thinks I betrayed him.

01:21:48.578 --> 01:21:50.288
I hurt the woman I love.

01:21:51.456 --> 01:21:53.541
I ruined Christmas.

01:22:02.633 --> 01:22:03.676
Charlie!

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:06.345
How'd you get up here?

01:22:12.185 --> 01:22:13.227
Scott!

01:22:13.644 --> 01:22:16.064
I got to fly in
with the Tooth Fairy.

01:22:16.272 --> 01:22:18.316
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:22:18.399 --> 01:22:21.360
Brush between meals
and don't forget the floss.

01:22:21.444 --> 01:22:24.030
And if anybody cares,
I'm exhausted.

01:22:24.781 --> 01:22:27.116
And she...
has a beautiful smile.

01:22:28.826 --> 01:22:31.579
- Thank you for everything.
- No. Thank you.

01:22:32.663 --> 01:22:35.041
I am... the Molarnator!

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:40.963
Whoo!

01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:42.548
Come on!

01:22:58.314 --> 01:22:59.982
Hyah!

01:23:14.831 --> 01:23:16.541
Get out of the way!

01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:18.209
What are you doing?

01:23:18.292 --> 01:23:21.129
- You gotta save Christmas.
- How am supposed to save...?

01:23:25.508 --> 01:23:27.927
- No, no, no.
- Please. Don't worry.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.430
Whoa!

01:23:31.764 --> 01:23:33.641
Slow down.

01:23:34.767 --> 01:23:36.394
Stay.

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:39.731
Whoah!

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.775
Oh, Chet...

01:23:43.735 --> 01:23:46.070
Ouch! Ow! Oh, oh, oh!

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:50.074
Thanks. Excuse me, pork chop.

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:53.411
OK. Chet, this is it.
You ready to rock and roll?

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:56.664
- Chet?
- Yeah. He's still in training.

01:23:56.873 --> 01:24:00.585
- Has he had much flight time?
- About a minute and a half.

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:03.254
- He's had a lot of crash time!
- Curtis...!

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:06.049
- He's just a baby.
- All right.

01:24:07.133 --> 01:24:09.302
Let's see what this baby can do.

01:24:09.552 --> 01:24:11.137
- Oh, boy.

01:24:11.429 --> 01:24:14.182
Ready to go, buddy?
You know what we gotta do.

01:24:14.265 --> 01:24:15.933
Hyah!

01:24:18.603 --> 01:24:21.105
Chet! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chet, Chet.

01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:27.195
You gotta focus, Chet.

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:33.117
OK, everybody! Outside, now!

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:39.123
Almost there, boys. Let's go!

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:44.963
- Chet, whoa!

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:03.314
Snowballs, on three!

01:25:04.023 --> 01:25:05.692
One!

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:08.569
Two!

01:25:15.034 --> 01:25:16.703
Three!

01:25:34.012 --> 01:25:35.513
OK, elves...

01:25:37.181 --> 01:25:38.850
Let's get 'em!

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.025
Whoa, whoa! Not so far!

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:48.776
- Whoa, Chet!
- Whooh!

01:25:49.402 --> 01:25:51.779
Back for more action,
eh, scooter?

01:25:51.863 --> 01:25:53.531
- Chet, Chet!

01:25:56.576 --> 01:25:58.244
Cut the chitchat, Chet!

01:25:58.661 --> 01:26:00.705
Why is this such a problem?
Come on!

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:02.916
Where do you think you're going?

01:26:02.999 --> 01:26:05.960
- Go, go!
- Hyah, boy! Come on!

01:26:07.003 --> 01:26:08.463
Faster!

01:26:09.756 --> 01:26:12.008
The lead.
The one in the front, Chet!

01:26:12.091 --> 01:26:14.427
Leave my reindeer alone!

01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:17.096
- Go! Go! Go!

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:20.600
Come on! We got to get them
before they get out the hole.

01:26:20.683 --> 01:26:22.810
Stay away from my lead reindeer!

01:26:24.771 --> 01:26:27.106
- Whoo!

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.651
Holy Hannah,
he's an action hero!

01:26:29.734 --> 01:26:31.569
Hyah!

01:26:53.424 --> 01:26:58.304
What are you doin' up there?
I can't see where I'm driving.

01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:02.934
You are a sad,
strange little man.

01:27:04.394 --> 01:27:05.436
Whoa!

01:27:06.563 --> 01:27:08.690
You're gonna fall... I hope!

01:27:10.984 --> 01:27:13.486
That's a good way
to lose an eye!

01:27:15.822 --> 01:27:18.408
Look out! You're scaring me!

01:27:25.290 --> 01:27:27.000
Can I help you?

01:27:27.083 --> 01:27:29.252
Honey, I'm home!

01:27:34.424 --> 01:27:36.175
Loser!

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:32.815
Hey, I'm supposed to wear this
coat! How about a little elbow?

01:28:32.899 --> 01:28:35.568
There you are.
That's gotta feel good.

01:28:36.361 --> 01:28:39.405
You want the shoe?
Take it off. Go ahead. Go on!

01:28:45.370 --> 01:28:46.412
Uh?

01:28:47.413 --> 01:28:50.291
What are we gonna do now,
smartypants?

01:28:52.001 --> 01:28:54.295
Watch out!
The building! Left, left!

01:28:54.379 --> 01:28:56.798
Oh, well.
The town'll break the fall.

01:29:02.595 --> 01:29:04.055
Look out!

01:29:05.932 --> 01:29:09.144
Yo, Tony! Hey, Brian, stop me!

01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:14.732
Oof!

01:29:16.943 --> 01:29:20.238
Get off of me! Now remember,
rules are very, very important!

01:29:20.321 --> 01:29:22.157
I want hot chocolate.

01:29:22.448 --> 01:29:25.994
Hey, guys, back up. I've
got a special place for him.

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:30.165
You idiot! Wait a minute,
something's shocking me.

01:29:30.248 --> 01:29:32.292
- You were great.
- Sounds like you were too.

01:29:32.375 --> 01:29:34.502
- We've got ten minutes.
- Where is Carol?

01:29:35.962 --> 01:29:37.547
- Carol! Are you all right?
- Yes!

01:29:37.630 --> 01:29:40.925
- Where are you going?
- I gotta deliver gifts.

01:29:41.176 --> 01:29:42.886
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:29:42.969 --> 01:29:44.971
- No.
- You gotta get married.

01:29:45.054 --> 01:29:47.140
Excuse me?

01:29:49.809 --> 01:29:51.352
Carol, l...

01:29:52.896 --> 01:29:58.067
I cannot continue being Santa...
unless I find a Mrs Claus.

01:29:59.402 --> 01:30:02.989
Oh. So that's what the whole
noodles and pie thing...

01:30:03.072 --> 01:30:05.784
- You just needed a wife.
- No.

01:30:06.451 --> 01:30:07.827
No?

01:30:08.411 --> 01:30:10.079
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:30:10.789 --> 01:30:12.791
Yes, I was looking for a wife.

01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:17.253
No, I didn't figure on
falling... in love.

01:30:21.424 --> 01:30:23.218
You love me?

01:30:25.595 --> 01:30:29.641
- This is all happening so fast.
- Well, there's no pressure.

01:30:30.642 --> 01:30:32.018
Good.

01:30:32.102 --> 01:30:35.355
I mean, if I don't get married
I just won't deliver the gifts

01:30:35.438 --> 01:30:38.525
and children everywhere
will stop believing,

01:30:38.608 --> 01:30:42.570
the elves will lose their jobs,
the North Pole will disappear

01:30:42.654 --> 01:30:44.739
and Christmas will be gone.

01:30:47.867 --> 01:30:49.702
- Get down on one knee.
- Hm?

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.163
Do it. Now.

01:30:56.084 --> 01:30:58.169
Say "Carol."

01:31:00.964 --> 01:31:02.757
- Carol.
- Uh-huh?

01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:04.384
Yeah?

01:31:04.467 --> 01:31:07.303
You say this is happening
all so fast.

01:31:08.346 --> 01:31:10.932
You say this is happening
all so fast.

01:31:11.099 --> 01:31:13.435
But you've known me
your whole life.

01:31:14.728 --> 01:31:16.771
But you've known me
your whole life.

01:31:16.855 --> 01:31:19.107
When you were
little and alone...

01:31:20.442 --> 01:31:23.361
- Santa...
- I can take it from here.

01:31:23.445 --> 01:31:25.405
..Santa was always
there for you.

01:31:25.488 --> 01:31:29.159
And I will be, as long as you
continue to believe in me.

01:31:29.451 --> 01:31:32.036
I know I'm asking you
to leave everything at home,

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:34.706
but I can guarantee you
that this is worth it.

01:31:34.789 --> 01:31:36.458
This place...

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:39.627
This place is all about magic

01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:43.173
and love... and wonder.

01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:47.052
And occasionally
a thin-crust pizza

01:31:47.469 --> 01:31:50.013
and a movie and
a long winter night.

01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:53.016
Is there a school here?

01:31:55.685 --> 01:31:59.647
Yeah, we have one, a school, but
the elves need a new principal.

01:31:59.731 --> 01:32:03.651
Cos as of late some of the elves
have been acting a bit impish.

01:32:10.241 --> 01:32:12.327
Carol...

01:32:13.787 --> 01:32:15.872
- I love you.
- You do?

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:19.334
Would you be my wife?

01:32:21.086 --> 01:32:22.670
I will.

01:32:22.754 --> 01:32:25.632
Thank you.
I've got it from here.

01:32:30.762 --> 01:32:32.430
I will.

01:32:37.602 --> 01:32:40.730
By the powers vested in me
by me,

01:32:41.981 --> 01:32:43.733
I now pronounce you Santa

01:32:44.776 --> 01:32:46.277
and Mrs Claus.

01:32:49.781 --> 01:32:52.242
Well, go on now. Kiss her!

01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:00.917
Awwww!

01:33:24.607 --> 01:33:27.902
- Dad, we gotta go.
- Walk me to my sleigh.

01:33:28.278 --> 01:33:32.032
We gotta go! When we get back,
we start making some more toys.

01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:40.999
All right. Well, Mrs Claus,
you might want to get some rest.

01:33:41.333 --> 01:33:44.711
You see, tomorrow begins
vacation season for me,

01:33:44.794 --> 01:33:48.423
which means a three-month
honeymoon for us.

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:53.845
Nothing tropical. You do not
want to see this in a Speedo.

01:33:55.513 --> 01:33:57.390
Don't be home too late.

01:33:58.433 --> 01:34:00.226
And so it begins.

01:34:00.352 --> 01:34:02.937
Boys, we've got
some toys to deliver!

01:34:03.355 --> 01:34:04.898
Hyah!

01:34:26.711 --> 01:34:28.338
Lucy?

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:30.757
What, Charlie?

01:34:31.549 --> 01:34:34.344
Come downstairs.
I want you to see something.

01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:45.897
Lucy.

01:34:46.731 --> 01:34:48.775
Watch this.

01:35:04.833 --> 01:35:06.584
Uncle Scott?!

01:35:10.589 --> 01:35:13.466
- Do you have any twos?
- Go fish!

01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:17.512
You are Santa!
I knew it was you all along.

01:35:17.596 --> 01:35:20.181
- And you were right.
- Uncle Scott...

01:35:20.974 --> 01:35:23.893
You look all rosy.
Are you feeling better?

01:35:24.311 --> 01:35:26.479
I'm feeling much, much better.

01:35:26.646 --> 01:35:29.232
Is there anything else
I should know about?

01:35:29.316 --> 01:35:33.445
I don't know. But Charlie has
something he wants to tell you.

01:35:33.528 --> 01:35:35.113
OK.

01:35:36.573 --> 01:35:41.369
You know, I was exactly your age
when I found out my dad was Santa.

01:35:41.453 --> 01:35:44.915
- But I couldn't tell anybody.
- I can't tell anybody either?

01:35:44.998 --> 01:35:48.001
No. But knowing it
isn't a burden.

01:35:49.169 --> 01:35:50.754
It's a gift.

01:35:52.213 --> 01:35:55.508
Most kids stop believing in
Santa when they grow up.

01:35:55.592 --> 01:35:57.886
But I get to
believe in him forever.

01:35:57.969 --> 01:36:00.847
I love you, Charlie. Thank you.

01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:08.688
But do we still get toys?

01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:12.025
If you ever get to bed and go to
sleep like the other kids.

01:36:12.108 --> 01:36:14.027
Oh... OK!

01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:18.448
- Merry Christmas, Lucy.
- Merry Christmas, Santa.

01:36:19.449 --> 01:36:21.618
Sport, I gotta fly.

01:36:37.634 --> 01:36:40.178
- Easy, boys, easy.

01:36:41.096 --> 01:36:43.181
You're gettin' it, Chet.

01:36:55.861 --> 01:36:57.946
Look, Charlie!

01:36:59.239 --> 01:37:01.157
Merry Christmas, Comet!

01:37:07.747 --> 01:37:12.002
All right, boys!
Hyah! Ho, ho, ho!

01:37:13.461 --> 01:37:15.589
- Hyah!

01:37:15.672 --> 01:37:18.925
Merry Christmas to all!
And to all a good night!

01:37:21.303 --> 01:37:23.513
Nothin' wrong with
a straight line, Chet.
