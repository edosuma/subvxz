WEBVTT

00:21.187 --> 00:23.255
How much are these?

01:18.645 --> 01:22.214
<i> These spies are even
more cunning than I thought.</i>

01:22.216 --> 01:25.217
<i>They appear to have been</i>
<i>operating for some time</i>

01:25.219 --> 01:27.352
<i>right under our noses.</i>

01:31.224 --> 01:33.092
Spies?

01:33.094 --> 01:36.128
Now they've been promoted
from conspirators to spies?

01:36.130 --> 01:38.363
Well, the distinction
is hardly great.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.232
And yet still no evidence.

01:40.234 --> 01:43.168
No names, just
conjecture and gossip.

01:43.170 --> 01:46.138
Gossip is how
these things start.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.475
Scripture tells us that the
tongue is a restless evil

01:49.477 --> 01:51.510
full of deadly poison.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.746
And it tells us that "Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbor."

01:54.748 --> 01:56.548
It's been a month,
Captain Simcoe.

01:56.550 --> 02:00.185
Where is this mythical Patriot
petition that I was promised?

02:00.187 --> 02:03.789
I've yet to uncover it. I fear
it's likely been destroyed.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.891
<i>So then all you have is gossip.</i>

02:16.169 --> 02:18.537
<i> I have a sense
the conspirators</i>

02:18.539 --> 02:20.506
<i>know that I'm coming for them.</i>

02:26.279 --> 02:27.613
Calm down, Bucephalus.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.751
Shh, calm down.
Calm, boy.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.453
<i>He's gone mad!</i>

02:36.556 --> 02:38.891
Easy! Easy! Easy!

02:43.630 --> 02:46.231
<i> Bucephalus, calm.</i>

02:46.233 --> 02:48.400
- Bucephalus!
- Out!

02:54.942 --> 02:56.675
Ah!

03:03.851 --> 03:05.751
Someone was in a hurry.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.555
Oh, believe me.
I wish we had more time.

03:12.792 --> 03:16.295
If I could, I'd leave this
place with you tomorrow.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.434
But you can't.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.676
And neither can I.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.445
You've your obligation
to your family...

03:34.881 --> 03:38.517
and we both have our roles
to play for Washington...

03:38.519 --> 03:40.919
- Mr. Culpepper.
- <i> Mm.</i>

03:41.988 --> 03:44.489
I hate that name.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.491
Oh, I don't know.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.893
I quite like it.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.495
Oh, really?

03:50.497 --> 03:53.599
After all, if I can't
be Mrs. Woodhull,

03:53.601 --> 03:55.968
perhaps I can be
Mrs. Culpepp...

03:55.970 --> 03:57.469
No, don't say it.

03:57.471 --> 04:00.305
Don't say it.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.739
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.742
Bucephalus.
Bucephalus.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.378
Shh, shh, shh.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.680
<i>Bucephalus.</i>

04:41.682 --> 04:44.516
Bucephalus, shh, shh.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.751
<i>Easy, boy.</i>

04:45.753 --> 04:48.887
Easy. Be still.
Be still.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.779
His heart
was under great stress.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.018
And I've little doubt
of the cause.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.754
Are you suggesting poison?

05:55.756 --> 05:59.024
Well, I don't know much
about them, but there's...

05:59.026 --> 06:02.961
there's a foreign smell
to this apple, like almonds.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.030
Of course he was poisoned.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.732
What else could it be?

06:06.734 --> 06:09.634
He was... he was
in perfect health.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.870
Just perfect.
Perfect.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.639
This was murder.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.508
A senseless murder.

06:16.510 --> 06:20.645
I doubt Bucephalus was
the intended target, Major.

06:20.647 --> 06:23.415
Didn't you often eat the
same apples you fed him?

06:24.517 --> 06:29.054
Someone was trying
to kill you, sir.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.523
Do you know where
this fruit came from?

06:31.525 --> 06:34.860
Uh, Brewster...
Lucas Brewster.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.896
He has the biggest
orchard in town.

06:37.898 --> 06:41.666
Brewster is one of the names
at the top of my list.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.535
A miscreant in his youth,

06:43.537 --> 06:46.438
vocal in his rejection
of any authority.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.042
I'll detain him
while we search his farm.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.712
<i> The answer was
here all the time.</i>

06:53.714 --> 06:55.614
<i>Sir, we merely needed the key.</i>

06:55.616 --> 06:58.717
The cipher key, from Major
Andre's own code book no less.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.552
Courtesy of our friend
in New York.

07:00.554 --> 07:04.556
Mr. Culpepper does not shy
away from the bold play.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.425
And once Mr. Sackett
deciphered it,

07:06.427 --> 07:08.960
we were able to apply it
to the encrypted dispatches

07:08.962 --> 07:10.762
that we intercepted last month.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.564
"And immediately
there fell from his eyes"

07:12.566 --> 07:14.433
as it had been scales,

07:14.435 --> 07:16.101
"and he received sight
forthwith."

07:16.103 --> 07:19.838
Mr. Sackett, it seems, has
undergone a conversion to faith.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.973
Hmm, perhaps
because, for the first time,

07:21.975 --> 07:24.776
we are able to see their
movements as a deity might...

07:24.778 --> 07:26.445
from on high.

07:26.447 --> 07:30.715
Sir, the enemy will try
to take Philadelphia by sea,

07:30.717 --> 07:32.784
by the Delaware Bay.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.188
All of our scouting reports
argue that the attacks

07:36.190 --> 07:37.722
will come by land
from the north.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.191
That's what
they want you to think.

07:39.193 --> 07:42.127
It's a feint, sir.
The dispatches indicate

07:42.129 --> 07:44.863
<i>that General Howe</i>
<i>has ordered 3,000 men</i>

07:44.865 --> 07:47.866
to be withdrawn
from Cornwallis's troops

07:47.868 --> 07:50.735
and quietly marched
to Staten Island,

07:50.737 --> 07:53.171
where the Royal Navy
has secretly gathered

07:53.173 --> 07:56.475
over 100 boats
for an expeditionary force.

07:56.477 --> 07:59.177
The order reportedly left
Cornwallis in high dudgeon,

07:59.179 --> 08:01.213
anxious as he was
to personally thank you

08:01.215 --> 08:05.984
for disrupting a visit to his wife
with that, uh, Trenton affair.

08:07.553 --> 08:11.089
Major Tallmadge,
you are to ready a detachment

08:11.091 --> 08:14.059
to rendezvous with General
Arnold in Connecticut,

08:14.061 --> 08:15.994
dragoons and militia,
immediately.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.162
North?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.698
But, sir, we've just proven

08:19.700 --> 08:21.166
that the attack
will be coming from...

08:21.168 --> 08:24.836
From the south, which is
why I will make plans

08:24.838 --> 08:27.973
to shore up our defenses
on the Delaware, if you agree.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.542
Of course, sir.

08:30.544 --> 08:34.513
Good, then unless you think it's wise
to inform the enemy of our plan,

08:34.515 --> 08:36.280
perhaps you will join me
in convincing them

08:36.283 --> 08:38.917
that <i> their</i> plan is working.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.586
A counter-feint.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.193
You have discretion
to act as you see fit

08:48.195 --> 08:50.629
to advance the mission.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.301
I'll stay here.

09:50.356 --> 09:53.258
Oh, Mrs. Woodhull, I didn't
know you were coming.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.993
I'm sorry to startle you,
Mr. Baker.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.095
I thought you were my husband.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.599
Would you like me
to cook something?

10:00.601 --> 10:02.901
- Oh, no, no. I couldn't ask that.
- It's...

10:02.903 --> 10:06.638
I'd do it for Abraham,
but he's not here.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.742
I can hazard a guess
of where he is, of course.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.344
Or who he's with.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.846
Perhaps I should leave.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.282
Why?

10:17.284 --> 10:20.118
You're the only one
who really lives here now.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.658
Tell me, Mr. Baker...

10:29.629 --> 10:30.962
did your parents marry for love

10:30.964 --> 10:33.264
or did their parents
decide for them?

10:34.767 --> 10:37.969
I never knew my parents.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.872
I was told my father
was a sailor and my mother...

10:43.776 --> 10:46.411
I was raised in an orphanage.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.314
<i>I never had the luxury of
growing up in a home like this,</i>

10:49.316 --> 10:51.816
as your son will.

10:54.253 --> 10:56.388
There is love here,
Mrs. Woodhull.

10:58.257 --> 11:01.292
I know because I know what
its absence feels like.

11:14.207 --> 11:18.176
- Is the owner here? DeJong?
- No, but I can get him.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.680
- Whatever they said I did, it's not true.
- That's enough out of you.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.815
Tell him we're taking his
cellar as a temporary jail.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.317
<i>Orders of the major.</i>
<i>I need you to open it.</i>

11:28.020 --> 11:30.755
<i>Was that Lucas Brewster?</i>

11:33.025 --> 11:35.193
<i>They arrested Lucas Brewster.</i>

11:37.930 --> 11:42.434
<i> I admit the
evidence is damning,</i>

11:42.436 --> 11:46.304
though I find it hard to imagine
a man afflicted with palsy

11:46.306 --> 11:50.408
would have the steady
hand to mix poison.

11:50.410 --> 11:54.045
A weak constitution is an excellent
cover for a devious mind.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.781
Abraham?

11:56.783 --> 11:59.718
Forgive the intrusion. I heard
Lucas Brewster's been arrested.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.019
Are the charges serious?

12:01.021 --> 12:03.321
Very, Captain Simcoe
believes that Brewster

12:03.323 --> 12:05.990
<i>killed Major Hewlett's horse</i>
<i>with a poisoned apple</i>

12:05.992 --> 12:09.294
intended for the major himself.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.896
He died for me.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.999
These are serious charges.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.769
Is there any evidence
to support them?

12:17.771 --> 12:19.204
We have the matter
well in hand.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.472
<i>Thank you, Farmer Woodhull.</i>

12:20.474 --> 12:24.209
Has Brewster
in any way confessed?

12:24.211 --> 12:25.944
No.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.413
But I expect a noose will
make an honest man of him.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.517
Perhaps before rushing
to that conclusion,

12:32.519 --> 12:36.788
we should send for someone
more expert than Dr. Mabbs.

12:37.957 --> 12:41.292
If we are gonna hang
a citizen of Setauket,

12:41.294 --> 12:43.962
the accusation
should be confirmed.

12:43.964 --> 12:48.233
Of course, Your Honor.
Every care should be taken.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.402
I'll advise the major.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.912
Oh, damn. Mary borrowed my coach
to visit you with Thomas.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.914
That's all right, I can
give you a ride into town.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.382
- Right.
- Could I accompany you?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.484
Wouldn't your
own horse be faster?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.319
I'm in no rush.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.054
And I'd appreciate the
chance to discuss the case

13:10.056 --> 13:11.856
against Brewster
with Your Honor.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.358
I must say, I'm pleased
to see you two

13:13.360 --> 13:15.026
have moved past
your differences.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.128
Indeed.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.130
I've learned that
patience and forbearance

13:19.132 --> 13:23.067
are much preferred
to anger and rash action.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.470
I agree, especially
when personal grudges

13:25.472 --> 13:27.338
end up affecting
those who are innocent.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.174
Yes, the innocent must be
protected at all costs.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.342
That must be the foremost
concern of any justice...

13:31.344 --> 13:32.944
Ah!

13:32.946 --> 13:34.979
Father!
Father!

13:35.815 --> 13:38.016
Stay down!

13:38.018 --> 13:39.884
Oh, Jesus.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.253
It came from over there.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.256
Father, look at me.
Look at me!

13:45.258 --> 13:46.524
Help!

13:46.526 --> 13:48.526
<i>Behind the fence!</i>

13:48.528 --> 13:50.595
Father!

13:53.966 --> 13:57.068
Wait, let him drink.
Let him drink, drink.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.404
Now hold him. Hold him down.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.841
Look at me, Father.
Look at me.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.877
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.146
- Put pressure, pressure.
- Hold him down.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.415
Oh, my God.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.383
Please, take him away.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.853
What happened?

14:14.855 --> 14:16.588
He has been shot

14:16.590 --> 14:19.190
just outside a few hours ago.

14:19.192 --> 14:23.261
Whoever it was has escaped for the
moment, but will be found soon.

14:23.263 --> 14:26.197
Come on, hurry up.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.333
I'll be right there.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.580
That's good.
All right, he's done.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.082
Praise be to God.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.450
If that ball had
punctured his stomach

14:45.452 --> 14:48.019
or had shattered on a rib,
he'd be gone.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.026
Wh...

14:55.028 --> 14:57.161
- Is he dead?
- No.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.631
<i>He's just overcome.</i>

14:59.633 --> 15:03.301
We found the place
where he was shot from.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.271
A fence rail still spotted
with his powder,

15:06.273 --> 15:09.374
and we found this nearby.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.210
Must've used it
as wadding for a shot.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.646
It appears to be torn
from a book.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.247
The wadding survived?

15:16.249 --> 15:19.517
It's not any book.
A Bible.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.520
A verse from Judges.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.223
Hmm.

15:25.225 --> 15:29.594
An assassin who wraps his
boulette in the word of God.

15:29.596 --> 15:33.064
I want every firearm

15:33.066 --> 15:35.300
in this town
surrendered tomorrow

15:35.302 --> 15:37.602
and anyone who does not comply

15:37.604 --> 15:40.338
must be considered
a suspect and arrested.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.640
<i> I'll post the
order immediately.</i>

15:45.010 --> 15:47.478
I promise you, we'll find
the man who did this

15:47.480 --> 15:51.115
<i>and the rest</i>
<i>of this league of assassins.</i>

16:01.160 --> 16:03.294
<i>State your name.</i>

16:03.296 --> 16:05.096
Walter Havens.

16:05.098 --> 16:08.299
Havens.
One blunderbuss.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.235
The rebel whaleboats are
ranging further up the coast.

16:11.237 --> 16:13.671
Without my shot,
they'll take my catch.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.440
Your weapon will be
returned to you

16:15.442 --> 16:18.142
when I'm reassured
the town is once again safe.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.213
Safe for whom?

16:23.682 --> 16:27.385
Make a note... "Less than
fully cooperative."

16:27.387 --> 16:30.221
Oh, this is hardly necessary
in your case, Abraham.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.024
The law applies to me
the same as anyone else, sir.

16:35.627 --> 16:39.364
Mark him down,
"very cooperative."

16:47.206 --> 16:49.107
State your name.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.441
You know who I am.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.610
State your name.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.513
Nathaniel Tallmadge.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.616
This is my church that you
now call your stables.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.753
I think it suits the town better
as a defensive fortification

17:01.755 --> 17:04.288
rather than a pulpit
for seditious sermons.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.625
A fine fowling piece.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.359
If you say so.

17:09.362 --> 17:13.231
But what does a man of the
cloth need weapons for?

17:13.233 --> 17:17.300
Are we now practicing the
insurrection that we preached?

17:17.303 --> 17:20.137
I never minded fighting
for a just cause.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.407
Or speaking
against an unjust one.

17:28.113 --> 17:31.682
"For all they that take the sword
shall perish by the sword."

17:36.556 --> 17:39.290
Everything is set, Captain.

17:44.363 --> 17:47.098
Now they've taken our guns,
we're at their mercy.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.533
You mean the mercy
of the rebels

17:48.535 --> 17:50.201
like the one they've
got locked up down below.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.602
Figures that it's a Brewster.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.071
I'm married to a Brewster.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.606
Moses?

17:55.608 --> 17:57.308
Moses, do you still have it?

17:57.310 --> 17:59.777
- What?
- You know what I mean.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.448
The petition.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.216
You do, don't you?

18:05.218 --> 18:08.453
Well, I suggest you put it to
the fire and run while you can.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.354
Run? And just
leave everything?

18:10.356 --> 18:12.223
Well, what've you got?

18:12.225 --> 18:15.626
You have no family. You can
start over in Connecticut

18:15.628 --> 18:17.728
or join the Continentals.

18:17.730 --> 18:21.199
Walter, look at me.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.568
Look at me. I just...
I can't just leave...

18:23.570 --> 18:26.737
Just meet me
at moonrise by my boat.

18:26.739 --> 18:29.273
The cove beyond
Crane Neck Point.

18:31.176 --> 18:33.478
<i> You always were
an empty bottle, Robeson.</i>

18:33.480 --> 18:34.846
If you had as much brains
as you have guts,

18:34.848 --> 18:36.747
what a clever fellow you'd be.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.382
Guts enough to brain you.

18:42.821 --> 18:45.456
Enough.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.292
Whatever our grievances,

18:48.294 --> 18:50.261
we have more in common
with each other

18:50.263 --> 18:53.397
than we do with those men perched
like vultures up on that hill.

18:53.399 --> 18:57.301
<i>First, they took our church.</i>

18:57.303 --> 19:00.271
Then they took our headstones.

19:00.273 --> 19:04.242
Now the means to defend ourselves?
What will they take next?

19:04.244 --> 19:05.643
Hear, hear.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.547
Don't you see who
your real enemies are?

19:09.549 --> 19:12.517
Spoken like a true rebel.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.255
Might we have a word,
Reverend Tallmadge?

19:32.739 --> 19:34.872
<i>Good news. Good news.</i>

19:34.874 --> 19:36.707
We have found
the man responsible...

19:36.709 --> 19:39.577
your father's old nemesis,
Reverend Tallmadge.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.712
The reverend?

19:41.714 --> 19:44.282
Major, with all due respect,
the reverend would more likely

19:44.284 --> 19:45.950
shoot you than my father.

19:45.952 --> 19:50.221
His attitude when he turned in the
weapons was highly combative.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.657
Captain Simcoe found that his
musket had recently been fired,

19:52.659 --> 19:55.193
so I ordered his house
to be searched.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.328
I found this on his person.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.965
Judges 3, a most
appropriate selection.

20:00.967 --> 20:05.469
It seems the reverend is an artist
who cannot resist signing his work.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.338
A Mr. Moses Paine
to see you, sir.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.240
With urgent
information, he says.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.242
Very well.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.415
Major, Captain.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.517
What have you for us,
Mr. Paine?

20:19.519 --> 20:21.752
The petition
you've been looking for

20:21.754 --> 20:24.789
<i>backing Selah Strong</i>
<i>to the New York Congress.</i>

20:27.793 --> 20:29.627
I confess my name is on it,

20:29.629 --> 20:32.296
<i>a foolish mistake in a
moment of drunken weakness.</i>

20:32.298 --> 20:35.800
But I suspect there are others who
will prove of more interest to you.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.603
- The petition?
- Yes.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.373
It seems we finally
have the means

20:42.375 --> 20:44.842
<i>to capture the rest</i>
<i>of the cabal.</i>

20:44.844 --> 20:49.013
Arrest every name on this list
if they are still in town.

20:49.015 --> 20:52.817
<i>Order Appleton to start</i>
<i>building gallows for 10.</i>

20:52.819 --> 20:55.886
And arrest Mr. Paine.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.756
But I brought you this
information of my own free will.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.591
<i> No doubt</i>
<i>to save your own skin.</i>

21:00.593 --> 21:01.959
If you'd have
brought it earlier,

21:01.961 --> 21:03.828
you could've saved
another life.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.730
<i>Go.</i>

21:06.732 --> 21:08.532
These men will
require prosecution.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.501
Yes.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.936
We can hardly ask your father

21:11.938 --> 21:14.472
to manage such proceedings
in his condition,

21:14.474 --> 21:17.608
even if it is just a formality.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.410
I'll do it.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.579
I studied the law
at King's College.

21:21.581 --> 21:25.316
I have watched my father dispense
justice since I could stand.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.418
If he will trust me
to act in his stead,

21:27.420 --> 21:31.389
<i>it'll be swifter than to
wait for another magistrate.</i>

21:33.558 --> 21:35.059
Richard?

21:39.865 --> 21:42.633
It's time I assumed
some of the burden.

22:12.564 --> 22:16.600
<i>Hey, look at the boy.</i>

22:16.602 --> 22:18.769
Army life suiting you,
Mr. Strong?

22:18.771 --> 22:21.672
Better since you swiped me
a decent pair of boots.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.108
How far is the coast?

22:24.110 --> 22:27.545
The coast? Five
miles, give or take.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.347
You thinking of home, Selah?

22:29.349 --> 22:31.615
Well, with the men
we have here,

22:31.617 --> 22:33.517
we outnumber
Hewlett's garrison.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.454
I say we return there,
take back what's ours.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.889
Right, and after we take
it, we can stay there

22:38.891 --> 22:41.025
till, oh, at least suppertime

22:41.027 --> 22:42.660
before the Navy smokes us out.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.562
It'd be a good meal, though.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.865
Yeah, I'm with you there.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.540
Fraternizing
with the enlisted men?

22:56.542 --> 22:58.576
Not sure he'd be
so full of spunk

22:58.578 --> 23:00.811
if he knew his wife
thinks him dead.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.646
I coulda sorted this out
if your pal Sackett

23:02.648 --> 23:04.615
let me and Culpepper meet
up instead of having him

23:04.617 --> 23:06.584
stash his letters in the
hollow of an old tree.

23:06.586 --> 23:09.086
Sackett's procedures are
intended to keep you both safe.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.656
But these are our friends
we're lying to, Ben.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.792
They're agents. They only
know what they need to know.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.394
<i>Any more could</i>
<i>put them in danger.</i>

23:16.396 --> 23:17.928
Right, so Anna
doesn't need to know

23:17.930 --> 23:20.398
her husband's still alive.

23:20.400 --> 23:23.534
This isn't personal, Caleb.
It's a discipline...

23:23.536 --> 23:25.669
a craft,
as Mr. Sackett calls it.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.138
The more we stick by the rules,

23:27.140 --> 23:28.906
the better it will be
for all of us.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.595
What are you doing here?

23:51.597 --> 23:53.464
I heard a rumor
I couldn't imagine is true.

23:53.466 --> 23:54.899
Well, just let me explain.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.568
Moses Paine has turned
in the petition

23:57.570 --> 23:59.170
that backed Selah for Congress.

23:59.172 --> 24:01.739
They're out looking for
the others who signed it.

24:01.741 --> 24:05.843
So, why in God's name are you
helping Hewlett to swing the axe?

24:05.845 --> 24:07.578
The charges are false.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.113
Simcoe has created the threat.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.715
All I have to do
is present the case

24:11.717 --> 24:14.452
and then just
see it fall apart.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.986
You're planning to lose?

24:15.988 --> 24:17.588
Do you have a better idea?

24:17.590 --> 24:20.791
Gather those loyal,
raid the armory,

24:20.793 --> 24:22.593
storm the church, and shoot
Hewlett and Simcoe...

24:22.595 --> 24:24.929
And then hang the Grand
Union Flag over the church?

24:24.931 --> 24:28.466
- Mm.
- And then what?

24:28.468 --> 24:30.734
Then we bring
the war here to Setauket?

24:30.736 --> 24:33.637
The war is already here,
can't you see that?

24:36.875 --> 24:39.210
I have to study this.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.045
All right?

24:51.057 --> 24:55.159
<i> Law, in its most
general and comprehensive sense,</i>

24:55.161 --> 24:57.862
<i>signifies a rule of action</i>

24:57.864 --> 25:01.699
<i>and is applied indiscriminately</i>
<i>to all kinds of action...</i>

25:01.701 --> 25:03.734
<i>whether animate or inanimate,</i>

25:03.736 --> 25:06.637
<i>rational or irrational.</i>

26:57.983 --> 27:01.285
These men betrayed our trust.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.154
These men plotted murder.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.690
These men conspired.

27:08.226 --> 27:11.629
Now, what is the nature
of conspiracy?

27:11.631 --> 27:12.930
What defines it?

27:12.932 --> 27:14.832
Secrecy.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.901
<i>Betrayal.</i>

27:17.903 --> 27:20.671
The conspirator

27:20.673 --> 27:22.840
walls himself
from friend and neighbor

27:22.842 --> 27:24.742
and he lives a secret life,

27:24.744 --> 27:29.179
pretending to be a part of the
God-fearing community of man,

27:29.181 --> 27:33.350
the community of laws
and of shared values,

27:33.352 --> 27:36.787
<i>even as he plots its overthrow.</i>

27:36.789 --> 27:39.289
<i>Now, the evidence</i>
<i>against these men is clear.</i>

27:39.291 --> 27:41.191
<i>Of their guilt,</i>
<i>there is no doubt.</i>

27:41.193 --> 27:45.729
But it is their salvation
that we are about today.

27:45.731 --> 27:50.000
Only by their confession
can they repent their sins

27:50.002 --> 27:51.869
<i>and, in return,</i>

27:51.871 --> 27:54.271
solicit a measure of our mercy.

27:56.141 --> 27:58.742
Lucas Brewster,
stand and face the bench.

28:08.753 --> 28:11.355
Do you swear to tell the truth,

28:11.357 --> 28:12.923
the truth being
your only defense

28:12.925 --> 28:14.958
against these charges
against you?

28:14.960 --> 28:16.760
All right.

28:16.762 --> 28:19.997
I... I suppose I...

28:19.999 --> 28:23.300
Yes. Yes, I do.

28:25.136 --> 28:29.940
Did you conspire with Nathaniel
Tallmadge and these other men

28:29.942 --> 28:33.110
to assassinate Major Hewlett
and Judge Richard Woodhull?

28:33.112 --> 28:35.412
No.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.015
Of course not.

28:38.017 --> 28:42.853
And yet this vial of cyanide
poison was found in your house.

28:42.855 --> 28:46.857
Those redcoats claim they found it.
It's nothing of mine.

28:46.859 --> 28:50.394
Mr. Brewster, it is pointless
to impugn the words

28:50.396 --> 28:53.197
of these good men.
These are officers.

28:53.199 --> 28:56.100
They are sworn to protect us and
they have earned our trust.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.869
Yeah, and what about my word?

28:58.871 --> 29:01.739
Your word?
The word of a poisoner?

29:01.741 --> 29:03.373
The lowest form of assassin?

29:03.375 --> 29:05.409
He who strikes like a
viper from the shadows,

29:05.411 --> 29:08.045
too fearful to face his enemy?
Your word, sir?

29:08.047 --> 29:10.881
- These are lies cooked up by them.
- <i> Why would they lie?</i>

29:10.883 --> 29:13.984
- <i> What possible motive would they have?</i>
- Damned if I know.

29:13.986 --> 29:16.987
You conspired against the Crown!
You provided aid,

29:16.989 --> 29:18.756
- and you provided comfort to the enemy!
- No, no.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.224
- You tried to murder these men...
- No, no!

29:20.226 --> 29:21.859
...and you tried
to kill my father!

29:21.861 --> 29:23.927
Leave the poor man alone!

29:23.929 --> 29:26.196
Can't you see he's sick?

29:28.801 --> 29:30.768
Mr. Brewster may be seated.

29:30.770 --> 29:33.170
We will resume when order
is restored.

29:42.247 --> 29:43.981
An unfortunate turn.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.517
And yet I wonder
if it was just bad luck

29:46.519 --> 29:49.453
that let you rouse
such sympathy for a killer.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.455
Should I have been
gentler with him?

29:51.457 --> 29:54.792
This is just a formality,
as you said.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.527
You and I are merely
players in a comedy

29:56.529 --> 29:58.495
whose ending has
already been written.

30:01.099 --> 30:05.169
But, by all means,
continue the performance.

30:17.115 --> 30:20.184
Sip slowly, Father.
I'm not going anywhere.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.585
You should.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.887
Your husband may have need
of a friendly face

30:23.889 --> 30:26.223
during his first foray
as a magistrate.

30:26.225 --> 30:29.226
I'm afraid Abraham
does not feel much

30:29.228 --> 30:31.528
like a husband these days,
nor I a wife.

30:32.864 --> 30:36.066
Mary, whatever distance

30:36.068 --> 30:38.502
has grown between
you and my son,

30:38.504 --> 30:40.838
perhaps it's time
you acknowledge

30:40.840 --> 30:42.606
the part you have played in it.

30:44.108 --> 30:45.843
My part?

30:45.845 --> 30:48.278
You convinced me
to pardon Selah Strong.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.314
Yes, and that only
worsened the problem.

30:50.316 --> 30:53.483
Because it was a subterfuge
when you should've been direct.

30:55.253 --> 30:58.155
<i>Do you truly want Abraham?</i>

31:05.296 --> 31:09.366
Aberdeen
will take care of me.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.869
Go be with him.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.238
<i>Go be with your husband.</i>

31:23.381 --> 31:27.084
A page torn from a Bible
to help propel a bullet.

31:27.086 --> 31:30.053
<i>A bullet that nearly</i>
<i>ended my father's life.</i>

31:30.055 --> 31:33.323
A page from Judges
to help kill a judge.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.425
Do you deny it?

31:35.427 --> 31:38.495
Deny a page was torn from it,
no, but not by my hands.

31:38.497 --> 31:41.298
If not yours,
Mr. Tallmadge, then whose?

31:41.300 --> 31:45.602
That man visited me with one
of his men to ask questions.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.437
I'm guessing
when my back was turned...

31:47.439 --> 31:49.239
I suppose you also
credit Captain Simcoe

31:49.241 --> 31:51.308
with firing the round,
despite the fact

31:51.310 --> 31:54.978
that he was with myself and my
father at the time of the shooting.

31:54.980 --> 31:58.315
- But where were you?
- In my home.

31:58.317 --> 32:01.285
And can any
here testify to that?

32:02.253 --> 32:03.553
I was alone.

32:03.555 --> 32:06.189
Of course.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.492
You were alone.

32:10.261 --> 32:13.964
You've been alone for some
time now, haven't you?

32:13.966 --> 32:16.700
Because of the choices
that you've made,

32:16.702 --> 32:20.337
preaching rebellion until your
congregation walked away.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.706
Your father walked away.
The rest followed like sheep.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.108
<i> Because their
shepherd went astray!</i>

32:25.110 --> 32:27.477
And where did that leave you?

32:27.479 --> 32:31.348
Abandoned and angry, and
at one man in particular.

32:31.350 --> 32:35.252
So you went way beyond
sermonizing, didn't ya?

32:35.254 --> 32:37.688
Huh? Colluding
with all of these men

32:37.690 --> 32:40.590
to overthrow the powers that you
blamed for destroying your life!

32:40.592 --> 32:43.193
You preach against me
in my own church?

32:44.195 --> 32:46.229
Well, then repent.

32:46.231 --> 32:48.098
Just repent and silence me.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.367
- How dare you, boy?
- I dare because I'm the son

32:50.369 --> 32:52.169
of the man that
you almost killed.

32:54.038 --> 32:57.374
You were well-equipped for the
task as well, weren't you?

32:57.376 --> 33:01.311
I remember the war stories
you told when I was a boy.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.414
<i>His years fighting</i>
<i>the French and the Iroquois.</i>

33:04.416 --> 33:08.118
This is your musket, is it not?

33:08.120 --> 33:09.553
I don't deny the weapon's mine,

33:09.555 --> 33:12.189
but I deny I used it against
your father or any man.

33:12.191 --> 33:16.259
I swore an oath after that war
never to take another life.

33:16.261 --> 33:20.731
I see that you cannot
be induced to confess.

33:20.733 --> 33:25.068
Shall I then show
these good people

33:25.070 --> 33:28.772
how you used musket and ball
together so shamefully?

33:30.608 --> 33:34.344
First, the primer, yes?

33:37.048 --> 33:39.449
And then the firing charge.

33:44.122 --> 33:47.057
Then the ball that was extracted
from my father's body.

33:49.561 --> 33:53.463
And then to ram it home,
just a...

33:55.501 --> 33:57.601
It seems our
farmer-turned-barrister

33:57.603 --> 33:59.436
is in need of some assistance.
Allow me.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.272
Allow me.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.146
Ball?

34:34.539 --> 34:37.706
I'm guessing you've never seen
a Pennsylvania rifle, Captain.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.743
The barrel's grooved.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.080
It takes a smaller round
than your Brown Bess.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.449
That one you're trying
to jam down her muzzle,

34:45.451 --> 34:48.251
<i>the one our young Hotspur here
says almost killed his father,</i>

34:48.253 --> 34:51.088
well, that's a musket round.

34:51.090 --> 34:54.190
The kind a king's man might
use if he was bent on murder.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.462
After hearing
all my war stories,

34:58.464 --> 35:00.630
I'm surprised you
didn't know that, boy.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.435
That is enough evidence
for today.

35:05.437 --> 35:09.106
<i>I will now retire</i>
<i>and consider my ruling.</i>

35:09.108 --> 35:11.741
You have no right
to sit in judgment.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.310
No?

35:13.312 --> 35:15.345
I am the authority here.

35:15.347 --> 35:18.148
The only authority I
recognize is that of God's,

35:18.150 --> 35:19.649
and you, sir, are not He.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.251
Reverend, I believe
this proceeding...

35:21.253 --> 35:22.719
No, no, no.
It's all right.

35:22.721 --> 35:23.854
Let him speak.

35:23.856 --> 35:26.890
This will be his last sermon.

35:32.196 --> 35:35.665
A man may believe

35:35.667 --> 35:38.135
in freedom from tyranny

35:38.137 --> 35:42.339
and not be rebel or a traitor.

35:42.341 --> 35:46.309
If he is not free
to make up his own mind,

35:46.311 --> 35:49.312
that is the worst
form of tyranny.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.915
- Aye.
- Hear, hear.

35:54.218 --> 35:56.786
These men were sent here
to subjugate us.

35:58.589 --> 36:02.559
But I never would've expected

36:02.561 --> 36:05.829
the boy who grew up
best friends

36:05.831 --> 36:07.898
with my son Benjamin

36:07.900 --> 36:10.600
to turn against his own.

36:12.638 --> 36:16.940
Abraham, what did you do

36:16.942 --> 36:20.410
that day your father
walked out of my church?

36:20.412 --> 36:23.446
You stayed behind.

36:23.448 --> 36:26.349
You thought for yourself.

36:28.419 --> 36:30.320
A lesson for us all.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.860
That is enough.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.829
<i>Silence!</i>
<i>Take the prisoners down.</i>

36:39.831 --> 36:42.632
<i>Take them down now,</i>
<i>to the tavern cellar.</i>

36:53.377 --> 36:57.814
Abraham, I wanted to commend
you on your efforts today.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.549
I think your father
would be very proud.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.251
Oh, thank you, sir.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.988
Have you reached a decision?

37:04.990 --> 37:06.723
I have.

37:06.725 --> 37:10.560
I expect Mr. Appleton's labors
will not go unrewarded.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.262
To tell you the truth,
I would like nothing more

37:12.264 --> 37:14.397
than to hang these miscreants.

37:14.399 --> 37:18.335
But given the confusion
of today's proceeding,

37:18.337 --> 37:20.837
I think it best to show
that measure of mercy

37:20.839 --> 37:23.373
that you spoke of, Abraham.

37:23.375 --> 37:26.710
So, I am sentencing
them all to a term

37:26.712 --> 37:29.379
of no less than
10 years on the Jersey.

37:29.381 --> 37:32.782
Um, sir... ahem...
if I may.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.452
Given the conditions
aboard that ship,

37:35.454 --> 37:36.920
that is a death sentence.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.888
You think a hanging
more merciful?

37:38.890 --> 37:40.390
No, no.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.826
It's just that
what happened today...

37:42.828 --> 37:44.928
the business with the rifle...

37:44.930 --> 37:47.998
So he used a different weapon
than the one he turned in.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.799
He's clever,
I'll grant him that.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.401
Or perhaps he's innocent.

37:51.403 --> 37:53.703
I acknowledge that there are
untidy aspects to this case,

37:53.705 --> 37:56.640
and perhaps some were
overzealous in pursuing it.

37:56.642 --> 37:59.409
<i>But the most important thing</i>

37:59.411 --> 38:02.879
<i>is that an arm of disloyal
citizens have been identified</i>

38:02.881 --> 38:06.583
and the gangrenous limb
will now be cut off

38:06.585 --> 38:08.385
from the rest
of the healthy body.

38:08.387 --> 38:11.521
There's just one problem, sir.

38:13.524 --> 38:16.893
It seems to me that the true
assassin may still be out there.

38:16.895 --> 38:20.864
I shall make it my mission
to find him out.

38:27.605 --> 38:29.506
<i> I can't feel
my legs anymore.</i>

38:29.508 --> 38:33.810
Let alone something else
of equal importance.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.514
How much
further to Ridgefield?

38:37.516 --> 38:39.049
No more than a day.

38:39.051 --> 38:41.918
I sent a scout ahead to alert
General Arnold of our arrival.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.088
Oh, of course you have.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.957
Now, look, don't be injured
if Benedict Arnold

38:47.959 --> 38:51.594
ain't as excited to meet the
famous Benny Boy Tallmadge.

38:51.596 --> 38:54.597
I will admit,
the man impresses.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.599
Imagine having your horse
shot out from under you,

38:56.601 --> 38:59.469
your leg pinned beneath it,
and instead of surrendering

38:59.471 --> 39:01.671
to the regular standing
above you with a bayonet,

39:01.673 --> 39:03.840
you pull his pistol
and shoot him dead.

39:03.842 --> 39:07.677
Yeah, it sounds like a tale
I'd tell about me self,

39:07.679 --> 39:11.514
which tells me he's
taking a bit of license.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.288
Company, halt!

39:13.288 --> 39:15.134
<i>- Company halt!</i>
<i>- Company halt!</i>

39:15.987 --> 39:17.420
Private.

39:17.422 --> 39:19.310
Caught him hiding in a ditch.

39:19.310 --> 39:21.932
<i>Thought he might be a spy, but when
he said he was from Setauket...</i>

39:21.932 --> 39:23.531
Let him down.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.103
- Mr. Havens.
- Ben.

39:34.906 --> 39:37.640
Walt, look at you.
How are ya?

39:37.642 --> 39:39.542
What brings you to Connecticut?

39:39.544 --> 39:41.778
A bloody-back
named Simcoe.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.713
Ever since he returned
to Setauket,

39:43.715 --> 39:45.715
he's had it in for us Whigs.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.385
Your father's
been arrested, Ben.

39:48.387 --> 39:51.588
- My father?
- And Lucas Brewster, too.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.923
Your father, my uncle.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.458
That's quite the coincidence.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.860
On what grounds
could he be arrested?

39:56.862 --> 39:58.428
Conspiracy.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.096
I left town
to cheat the hangman.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.499
I doubt the rest
will be so lucky.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.005
How many whaleboats
could you round up?

40:09.007 --> 40:10.407
What do you mean?

40:10.409 --> 40:14.411
- To carry all this lot?
- Aye.

40:14.413 --> 40:17.614
We're going home?

40:17.616 --> 40:19.716
We're going home.

40:27.858 --> 40:29.793
Thank you, Luke.

40:35.566 --> 40:38.067
All right, sweetheart,
we'll go upstairs.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.936
Time for your nap.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.988
Thomas!

41:33.624 --> 41:35.825
Thomas, stop it.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.794
Thomas.
