WEBVTT

00:30.791 --> 00:33.833
-You wanted to see me, Professor?
-Ah. Come in, Jayce.

00:33.916 --> 00:35.833
-Can you believe it?

00:35.916 --> 00:38.625
Our city is about to turn 200 years old.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.041
A bicentennial.

00:42.291 --> 00:45.500
It's shaping up
to be an amazing Progress Day.

00:48.791 --> 00:54.083
"Stanwick Padidly"?
Huh, I don't know much about him.

00:54.166 --> 00:57.916
Everything he built either exploded,
melted, or toppled over.

00:58.708 --> 01:00.708
And yet, here he stands.

01:02.333 --> 01:05.208
Stanwick set his personal ambitions aside

01:05.291 --> 01:07.833
and focused on something
far more important.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.625
Our future.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.375
He realized nothing he could accomplish

01:12.458 --> 01:15.291
could compare to the contributions
of his students.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.041
I had no idea.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.500
That was his sacrifice.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.333
A dear friend.

01:24.125 --> 01:28.041
The Council has recommended you give
the Progress Day speech this year.

01:28.125 --> 01:31.041
What… But you always give that speech.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.583
I… I could never take your place.

01:33.666 --> 01:35.666
I agree with them.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.750
Your Hexgates have done wonders
for our city.

01:38.833 --> 01:44.125
Brought scholars from distant lands.
Reignited passions in arts and science.

01:44.916 --> 01:46.458
You deserve this honor.

01:48.833 --> 01:52.416
I… I will do my best
to make Piltover proud, Professor.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.125
It's short notice, I know,

01:54.208 --> 01:58.083
but perhaps there's something in the lab
you might be able to share?

01:58.166 --> 01:59.916
People love a grand reveal.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.666
Viktor and I have just the thing.
The next chapter of Hextech.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.708
Come to the lab this afternoon,
I'll show you.

02:05.791 --> 02:07.291
I'll look forward to it.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.708
You certainly have something
to live up to, my boy.

03:18.083 --> 03:21.208


03:21.291 --> 03:27.250


04:07.875 --> 04:12.250
<i>Happy Progress Day.
Happy Progress Day.</i>

04:32.083 --> 04:36.083
Our most famous protégé, Jayce Talis.

04:36.708 --> 04:38.958
The visionary behind the Hexgates,

04:39.041 --> 04:43.041
a beacon of trade and prosperity
for our great City of Progress.

04:43.125 --> 04:43.958
Excuse me.

04:44.666 --> 04:46.541
Sorry, sorry. Yeah. Excuse me.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.916
-He's a very busy man.

04:54.458 --> 04:56.916
-Cait.
-Serves you right.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.291
You still avoiding her?

05:02.375 --> 05:03.208
I'm working.

05:03.750 --> 05:04.708
Oh, I can see that.

05:05.291 --> 05:08.583
I mean, there's so much crime
to thwart outside your family's tent.

05:08.666 --> 05:12.125
I can only imagine the strings she pulled
to have me posted here.

05:12.208 --> 05:13.625
It's your fault really,

05:13.708 --> 05:16.583
for not following her into a career
"more befitting your station."

05:17.791 --> 05:20.458
She'd do anything to keep me
from seeing the real world.

05:20.541 --> 05:22.791
Well, at least you'll have front-row seats
to the speech.

05:23.791 --> 05:24.708
Speech?

05:24.791 --> 05:27.166
Mm-hmm.
I'm giving the big address tonight.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.500
Hmm. We really have descended to anarchy.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.625
Have fun herding the drunkards.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.791
Happy Progress Day.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.333
Uh, shipping manifest?

06:19.791 --> 06:22.541
From your friend. Downtown.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.125
Let's go!

06:42.000 --> 06:43.666
Ah, shit. The Firelights.

06:59.291 --> 07:01.375
We have five minutes
till they're out of there.

07:08.708 --> 07:10.708
You ever seen
this much Shimmer before?

07:11.750 --> 07:15.291
They're expanding.
Check for more below. Burn it all.

07:29.666 --> 07:33.125
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Open up.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.375
Open the door.

07:43.708 --> 07:45.833
Oh, no. She's here.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.125
What the…

08:52.708 --> 08:53.750
Hi.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.916
Vi?

09:30.083 --> 09:31.541
I can't lose you.

09:34.958 --> 09:37.041
Why did you leave me?

09:37.125 --> 09:39.375
<i>Because you're a jinx.</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:45.500
-<i>I want to fight.</i>
-<i>You're not ready.</i>

09:51.125 --> 09:52.250
No.

10:44.166 --> 10:46.500
You were supposed to guard the cargo.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.958
You think he will approve?

11:10.166 --> 11:11.791
Heimerdinger believes
science should be used

11:11.875 --> 11:13.583
to improve lives as much as we do.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.125
We just need to show him it's safe.

11:17.375 --> 11:18.875
And what about the Council?

11:19.750 --> 11:22.375
We stabilized the crystal like they asked.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.416
Built the Hexgates like they asked.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.375
It's our turn to decide
the future of Hextech.

11:29.666 --> 11:32.083
Professor. I'm so glad you could make it.

11:32.166 --> 11:36.125
Wouldn't miss it for the world, my boy.
What do we have on the docket?

11:38.875 --> 11:40.500
It all began with this.

11:42.375 --> 11:44.458
A crystal of magical energy,

11:44.541 --> 11:47.375
too volatile to be handled
outside our workshops.

11:47.458 --> 11:50.583
Hextech was supposed to bring magic
into the life of the common man.

11:50.666 --> 11:54.000
And now, it finally can.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.708
A Hextech Gemstone.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.958
-Wait.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.875
Holy sprockets.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.000
We've found a means
to fortify the crystals.

12:22.083 --> 12:27.208
This new version is stable
and absolutely safe.

12:29.791 --> 12:34.041
We present to you
the next chapter of Hextech.

12:34.833 --> 12:37.458
We can now design portable devices.

12:37.541 --> 12:38.708
Oh…

12:42.000 --> 12:45.083
The Gemstone can power virtually anything.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.416
The Atlas Gauntlets.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.875
The mining colonies in the fissures
can work faster and without fatigue.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.666
The Hex Claw.

13:16.250 --> 13:20.250
A mechanical arm,
equipped with a powerful ray of light.

13:28.125 --> 13:31.583
Imagine what our artificers could do
with such a device.

13:32.166 --> 13:35.500
I want Hextech to be a tool
for us to build a new world.

13:35.583 --> 13:38.833
-And now, it's finally possible.

13:42.875 --> 13:46.166
Anyway, this is our presentation.

13:46.250 --> 13:50.541
Quite amazing, gentlemen.
You should be very proud.

13:51.125 --> 13:55.333
Obviously, there are a few kinks
to iron out and screws to be tightened,

13:55.416 --> 13:59.416
but give it a decade of careful research,
and it will be ready.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.666
A decade?

14:00.750 --> 14:04.666
Oh, don't worry, my boy.
It zips past you in the blink of an eye.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.541
With respect, Professor.

14:06.625 --> 14:09.541
We can be improving lives
with Hextech now.

14:09.625 --> 14:12.250
A breakthrough like this
takes time, Viktor.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.416
Putting that kind of power
into everyone's hands is dangerous.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.958
Keep at it and I'm sure
you will discover a way

14:18.041 --> 14:20.791
to safeguard Hextech against misuse.

14:32.791 --> 14:37.625
There must've been four, five of them.
I don't know how they got inside.

15:54.666 --> 15:55.875
You're from the undercity.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.833
I didn't do anything. She's crazy.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.041
-Easy.

16:03.291 --> 16:04.333
She shot me.

16:04.416 --> 16:06.875
Who shot you? Who were you working for?

16:07.708 --> 16:10.583
-I can't. He'll kill me.
-Who?

16:11.500 --> 16:13.291
-I can protect you.

16:13.916 --> 16:17.083
Caitlyn Kiramman,
why does that not surprise me?

16:17.708 --> 16:20.000
Interfering in an investigation, again.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.125
You're supposed to be guarding
your mother's tent.

16:23.208 --> 16:28.041
I was, Sheriff, but she doesn't need it.
And clearly, this takes priority.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.333
I realize you're used
to getting your way, Kiramman,

16:30.416 --> 16:32.291
but we have a chain of command
for a reason.

16:32.375 --> 16:33.958
I understand.

16:34.041 --> 16:36.666
But there's more going on here
than just the smuggling.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.541
-If I could just question him I could--
-I'll take it from here.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.250
Since you're looking for more work,

16:41.333 --> 16:43.666
you can take the graveyard shift tonight
at the fair.

16:44.666 --> 16:46.666
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.125
I want this one on a boat
to Stillwater prison.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.375
Yes, sir.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.708
She fired on us.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.291
There are always mishaps in battle.

17:38.833 --> 17:42.291
The Firelights were her target
and most are dead.

17:43.083 --> 17:46.958
It wasn't a mishap,
she froze up and lost her shit.

17:47.541 --> 17:49.333
I could've handled those brats.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.375
-She's a problem and we all know it.
-We?

17:53.958 --> 17:54.833
Who's we?

17:57.625 --> 18:00.541
I expect better from you than excuses.

18:00.625 --> 18:03.541
It was your job to make sure
things went smoothly.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.958
You failed. Don't disappoint me again.

18:16.416 --> 18:21.458
The world's growing smaller
every day, thanks to the Hexgates.

18:21.541 --> 18:23.833
And now, we're cut off.

18:23.916 --> 18:26.916
The topsiders are leaving us
further and further behind.

18:28.750 --> 18:29.791
What happened?

18:30.541 --> 18:31.791
She already told you.

18:33.250 --> 18:34.583
I'm asking you.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.958
One of those Firelight wackos
was a girl.

18:41.041 --> 18:44.833
-With pink hair.
-Hmm…

18:52.625 --> 18:54.291
Your sister's gone.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.000
You know that as well as I do.

18:57.083 --> 19:00.250
I know. I know. Sisters, right?

19:00.333 --> 19:03.500
You can't live with 'em, can't stuff
'em back in the ol' babymaker.

19:05.791 --> 19:08.291
Today's screw-up will set us back weeks.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.750
I'm sorry.

19:11.833 --> 19:15.500
-I need to know that I can rely on you.
-Phew.

19:16.458 --> 19:19.458
I'm doing this for us, Jinx. All of us.

19:19.958 --> 19:24.625
The sons and daughters of Zaun
deserve more than their runoff.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.458
It won't happen again.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.500
I know.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.416
Sevika will clean up today's mess.

19:42.500 --> 19:46.625
Sevika? That ogre couldn't clean
a dust bunny with a blowtorch.

19:46.708 --> 19:51.000
She'll suffice.
You should focus on your gadgetry.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.250
Ugh.

19:53.000 --> 19:53.833
Take some time.

19:54.375 --> 19:56.666
I don't need time.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.375
Take it anyhow.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.958
Fundraiser's going well.

20:26.708 --> 20:27.875
Your mother would be proud.

20:28.416 --> 20:29.875
Hmm… Would she?

20:30.416 --> 20:31.958
Tired of mingling?

20:32.041 --> 20:35.458
Hmm. These people have nothing new
to offer me.

20:36.041 --> 20:38.750
The only one actually worth my time
is him.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.666
The golden boy.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.125
Ah, he's won Piltover's heart.

20:45.125 --> 20:47.500
Oh, speak of the devil.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.416
Could I borrow you for a minute?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.750
To what do I owe the pleasure?

21:18.500 --> 21:20.291
It's Heimerdinger.

21:20.375 --> 21:21.916
When is it not?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.500
We've shown him our research.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.750
He thinks we need more time.

21:25.833 --> 21:27.291
It's Progress Day.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.916
Representatives from all over the world

21:29.000 --> 21:32.250
have come to see what new wonders
the City of Progress has to offer.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.458
If there's a time to present
a new creation, it is now.

21:37.541 --> 21:38.583
Great.

21:41.291 --> 21:46.750
Heimerdinger is a great scientist.
But he's old. He only ever sees the past.

21:47.458 --> 21:49.958
Piltover needs a leader who looks forward.

21:50.708 --> 21:52.250
Someone like you.

21:52.333 --> 21:53.916
You really believe that?

21:54.958 --> 21:58.916
Hextech has the potential
to change everything.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.333
The world is ready.

22:00.416 --> 22:02.875
And I've already spoken
to several potential investors.

22:02.958 --> 22:03.791
Investors?

22:03.875 --> 22:05.083
Of course.

22:05.166 --> 22:07.375
Everyone wants Hextech for themselves.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.875
It's your speech.

22:09.958 --> 22:12.500
Give the people a glimpse of the future.

22:27.166 --> 22:28.291
It wasn't her.

22:33.291 --> 22:34.125
It wasn't.

22:38.416 --> 22:42.250
I know. Just…
just some wannabe street trash.

22:42.875 --> 22:44.791
I got confused, that's all.

22:44.875 --> 22:47.833
Now, he thinks I'm weak.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.041
"Sevika will clean it up."

22:51.125 --> 22:54.083
Sevika's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.541
I'm not weak.

23:05.541 --> 23:07.166
And I'm gonna show him.

23:07.250 --> 23:10.458
Oh, I'm gonna show him. You'll see.

23:22.666 --> 23:23.833
Where were you?

23:23.916 --> 23:26.125
They were asking
if I could do the address.

23:26.208 --> 23:28.458
You should come up with me.
We're partners.

23:28.541 --> 23:32.500
No, no. Not in front of all of them…

23:34.083 --> 23:36.291
You… have your speech prepared?

23:37.208 --> 23:38.125
Uh-huh.

23:38.833 --> 23:41.750
An inspiration
to Piltover's future

23:41.833 --> 23:44.083
and that of all humanity.

23:44.166 --> 23:48.500
Please join me in welcoming to the stage…

23:49.125 --> 23:51.208
-Jayce Talis.
-Guess it's time.

24:31.250 --> 24:32.333
Uh, good evening.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.625
I know many of you probably didn't expect
to see me here today.

24:37.708 --> 24:39.833
And believe me,
I'm just as shocked as you are.

24:47.166 --> 24:51.458
My family and I are simple people.
In our factory, we made hammers.

24:52.083 --> 24:55.083
They were probably used to cut the stones
you're standing on right now.

24:56.208 --> 24:59.458
No one in my life
expected very much of me.

24:59.541 --> 25:04.541
And that is precisely what makes
this moment so extraordinary.

25:05.625 --> 25:08.791
A few years ago, the Hexgates
opened their ports to the world

25:08.875 --> 25:13.500
and made Piltover prosper beyond anything
we could have ever imagined.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.166
But… we're not done yet.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.500
This year, we've created something new
for you.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.916
Something that… um…

25:52.000 --> 25:55.208
That we will share with you…

25:58.833 --> 25:59.916
…when the time is right.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.416
Things that will bring an end
to your hardships.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.916
Whether you're the scion
of our high houses,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.208
or an honest laborer from the underground.

26:12.291 --> 26:15.916
We vow to keep pressing forward,
for we are the City of Progress.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.875
And our future is bright.

26:46.791 --> 26:48.000
That it, then?

26:48.083 --> 26:50.625
I thought that Talis boy
was some kind of genius.

26:50.708 --> 26:53.208
Last year, didn't he launch a blimp
halfway across the continent?

26:53.291 --> 26:54.625
Airship, actually.

26:54.708 --> 26:58.916
An airship has a rigid metal hull.
It's not a blimp.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.625
It's a balloon, ain't it?

27:00.708 --> 27:02.583
Sure as hell looks that way.

27:03.500 --> 27:07.375
Pardon us, if we aren't quite
so refined as you, milady.

27:08.291 --> 27:10.458
What are you
even doing here, Kiramman?

27:10.541 --> 27:12.875
Don't you have a cocktail party to attend?

27:16.708 --> 27:17.541
Fire.

27:18.041 --> 27:19.291
Fire!

27:25.583 --> 27:27.625
-What's happening?
-Get the fire brigade.

27:32.541 --> 27:36.500
Help. In here, please. Help me.

27:44.750 --> 27:49.000
Help. It's so hot, please. I'm trapped.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.583
I'm a helpless little girl
and I've set the building on fire.

27:55.666 --> 27:59.125
By accident. Totally by accident.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.125
Get out. Now.

28:07.208 --> 28:11.541
Also, I brought this dynamite.
Goodbye.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.583
<i>The Gemstone is gone.</i>

28:47.333 --> 28:49.708
<i>Along with some of our research papers.</i>

28:51.291 --> 28:53.208
<i>The situation is still developing.</i>

28:53.708 --> 28:56.791
<i>No one in the undercity
has claimed responsibility yet.</i>

28:58.250 --> 29:00.041
How did it come to this?

29:04.666 --> 29:08.708
Hmm. For too long
has the underground been left unchecked.

29:08.791 --> 29:10.166
We've lost touch.

29:10.250 --> 29:14.666
They may not be your preferred
constituents but they're still our people.

29:14.750 --> 29:18.250
The undercity cannot be controlled.
Not by us.

29:18.333 --> 29:20.208
So where does that leave us?

29:22.000 --> 29:22.833
Mr. Talis?

29:22.916 --> 29:25.708
Could the trenchers build a weapon
with the stolen crystal?

29:25.791 --> 29:27.666
Shimmer, body replacements…

29:27.750 --> 29:31.541
We've seen their ingenuity
over the years, of course, they can.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.875
If the right person got a hold of it,

29:36.958 --> 29:39.708
it's possible
they could utilize its energy.

29:39.791 --> 29:41.916
We need to address this immediately.

29:43.708 --> 29:44.708
I agree.

29:45.291 --> 29:48.416
It was my responsibility
to safeguard this technology and I failed.

29:49.083 --> 29:51.208
My mistake cost people their lives.

29:51.791 --> 29:55.083
I have come before you to recommend
that we suspend all Hextech operations

29:55.166 --> 29:56.833
until the situation is resolved.

29:57.333 --> 30:00.875
Including our laboratories,
the refinery and the Hexgates.

30:00.958 --> 30:02.791
Have you lost your mind?

30:02.875 --> 30:05.291
The Hexgates must remain open.

30:05.375 --> 30:08.791
Piltover's status
as a global shipping lane depends on it.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.875
Thousands would lose their income.

30:10.958 --> 30:14.791
But shouldn't the safety of Piltover
be our first priority?

30:14.875 --> 30:17.250
You would sacrifice your life's work?

30:17.333 --> 30:21.875
Without the Hexgates, my goods
cannot reach foreign markets till winter.

30:21.958 --> 30:23.708
Am I to tell the Noxians

30:23.791 --> 30:26.375
their next shipment of wine
will be vinegar?

30:26.458 --> 30:29.375
Councilors.
It appears we are at an impasse.

30:29.958 --> 30:33.416
If we shut down the Hexgates,
the city will suffer.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.000
But if we do nothing,

30:35.083 --> 30:38.416
we leave ourselves vulnerable
to malefactors.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.416
More lives may be lost.

30:41.541 --> 30:46.416
Perhaps the time has come
to explore a more radical solution.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.125
What are you suggesting?

30:50.291 --> 30:54.458
Mr. Talis has demonstrated
his commitment to our safety.

30:54.541 --> 30:57.583
He's willing to sacrifice
his own enterprise.

30:57.666 --> 31:00.541
And it seems to me only Mr. Talis

31:00.625 --> 31:03.625
has the knowledge necessary
to secure the Hexgates.

31:03.708 --> 31:07.041
I propose that a new chair
be brought forth,

31:07.625 --> 31:10.708
and that House Talis be elevated
to this august body.

31:10.791 --> 31:12.666
-What?
-As a Councilor,

31:12.750 --> 31:17.416
he will have the resources
necessary to protect all our investments.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.958
Councilor Medarda,
his is highly irregular.

31:21.041 --> 31:24.083
The Council has held seven seats
for generations.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.583
Does the boy have any experience?

31:26.666 --> 31:30.458
Only that of a scientist.
Like Heimerdinger.

31:36.958 --> 31:39.416
I believe Councilor Medarda is right.

31:39.916 --> 31:42.875
Hextech security should be
administered by a scientist.

31:43.416 --> 31:44.958
I second the motion.

31:45.041 --> 31:47.125
Well then, shall we vote?

32:07.333 --> 32:08.166
Jinx!

32:11.375 --> 32:13.625
Jinx! Jinx!

32:14.833 --> 32:15.875
Jinx!

32:15.958 --> 32:17.125
That's me.

32:17.208 --> 32:21.250
Half a dozen enforcers, dead. Enforcers.
Dead.

32:21.333 --> 32:23.416
-Yeah…
-A building blown to pieces.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.375
Oh, yeah.

32:26.958 --> 32:30.208
Do you have any idea what you've done?

32:30.291 --> 32:33.250
Actually, I do.

32:41.833 --> 32:43.791
Happy Progress Day!

33:11.875 --> 33:13.000
Hey.

33:13.583 --> 33:15.250
How are you feeling?

33:17.750 --> 33:19.458
I've had a break in the case.

33:19.541 --> 33:21.041
Shouldn't you be resting?

33:21.125 --> 33:22.458
While the trail is hot?

33:22.541 --> 33:24.791
Listen, you know how I've suspected

33:24.875 --> 33:28.041
there is a single mind
behind the undercity's violence?

33:28.125 --> 33:29.500
The great conspiracy.

33:29.583 --> 33:32.833
I think whoever attacked the square
is our suspect.

33:32.916 --> 33:36.375
The same symbols showed up at the botched
smuggling operation at the Hexgates.

33:36.458 --> 33:37.958
-The Hexgates?
-Keep up.

33:38.041 --> 33:41.583
All this time, they've kept their dealings
localized to the undercity.

33:41.666 --> 33:45.166
Low priority.
The attack on the square changes things.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.416
They've overstepped.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.000
If I can figure who made this,

33:48.083 --> 33:50.833
it could lead me directly
to whoever's behind it all.

33:50.916 --> 33:53.916
The answer is here,
staring me in the face.

33:54.875 --> 33:56.125
I can feel it.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.250
How do you intend to prove any of this?

34:02.666 --> 34:07.208
If I can just work this out.
Marcus will have to listen.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.666
If there's one thing
I've learned about the Council,

34:10.750 --> 34:12.291
they need more than just theories.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.875
Since when did you concern yourself
with the Council's opinion?

34:17.291 --> 34:18.416
Since I…

34:19.333 --> 34:20.458
became a Councilor.

34:23.166 --> 34:25.166
You're serious.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.083
When? Why?

34:27.666 --> 34:30.041
Have they discovered how to govern
with grease and a spanner?

34:30.125 --> 34:37.041
Ha ha. I was actually hoping
you might consider joining my staff.

34:39.541 --> 34:41.083
"House Talis Security."

34:42.625 --> 34:45.541
That's a ceremonial position.
I'd live behind a desk.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.541
You almost died, Cait.

34:47.625 --> 34:49.791
I just… I just want you to be safe.

34:49.875 --> 34:52.250
Thanks, but I already have a job.

34:53.083 --> 34:55.125
No. You don't.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.416
After the attack,
your parents spoke to the Sheriff.

35:00.458 --> 35:01.750
This is the best I could do.

35:02.541 --> 35:06.500
I don't need charity, Councilor.
Yours or my parents'.

35:06.583 --> 35:08.500
-Cait.
-Get out.

35:38.416 --> 35:40.333
I need to speak
with one of the inmates.

35:40.875 --> 35:44.416
Oh, folks in here
aren't usually very talkative.

35:44.958 --> 35:47.000
This one was hit by friendly fire.

35:47.083 --> 35:50.791
He's got reason to talk.
Must have been sent in today?

35:51.916 --> 35:56.166
Oh. Inmate 2135.

35:56.916 --> 36:00.375
<i>Yeah, I'm, uh, afraid that's not possible.</i>

36:00.458 --> 36:03.000
-Why not?
-Uh, well, there's been…

36:03.083 --> 36:05.541
-<i>an incident.</i>
-<i>What kind of incident?</i>

36:05.625 --> 36:08.000
-<i>The…</i>

36:08.083 --> 36:09.916
<i>…not so pretty kind.</i>

36:12.458 --> 36:14.916
<i>You don't understand,
I have to talk to him.</i>

36:15.416 --> 36:20.458
<i>Oh, you'll be able to.
As soon as he can move his jaw again.</i>

36:21.458 --> 36:22.541
<i>Who assaulted him?</i>

36:50.208 --> 36:51.333
Who the hell are you?
