00:05.898 --> 00:07.190
What's the problem with Lance
and how can we help?

00:07.274 --> 00:08.149
He's only in it for himself.

00:08.566 --> 00:11.190
This is the Coke campaign
we did down on the beach.

00:11.274 --> 00:12.857
That's what the ad lackeys
turned it into.

00:12.940 --> 00:15.357
They changed his skin tone
to fit this campaign.

00:15.441 --> 00:16.524
We like how Parker looks.

00:16.607 --> 00:17.566
Parker could have a show
tomorrow.

00:17.773 --> 00:19.232
That's three-million dollars
down the toilet.

00:19.857 --> 00:21.732
We coming out 'cause Vernon
getting his number retired

00:21.815 --> 00:22.732
at General Carver High.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.648
I wanted to talk to you
about playing again.

00:24.732 --> 00:25.898
I'm gonna need to see you
work out.

00:25.982 --> 00:26.982
RICKY JERRET:
You need to see me work out?

00:27.065 --> 00:27.898
What,
you got a problem with that?

00:28.232 --> 00:29.441
I got a problem
with working out. You right.

00:31.441 --> 00:34.399
Thank God the boy
has got more brains than you.

00:35.149 --> 00:38.190

you motherfucker.

02:37.732 --> 02:40.316
As if that wasn't
good enough for ya.

02:40.399 --> 02:42.149
After everything
we went through,

02:42.232 --> 02:44.357
everything that we slugged
our way through, our childhood

02:44.441 --> 02:46.690

02:46.773 --> 02:49.024
I mean, what the hell
could have been so hard?

02:49.107 --> 02:50.898
I thought you were
a fighter, Billy.

02:50.982 --> 02:53.482
What the fuck
were you thinking?

02:53.566 --> 02:55.482
I know it wasn't about me,
because if it was about me,

02:55.566 --> 02:57.482
you would have known that
I was always there for you,

no matter what he says,

04:16.982 --> 04:20.190
just take a deep breath
before you respond, huh?

04:20.274 --> 04:23.232
You know me. I specialize
in making people feel good.

04:23.316 --> 04:26.857
You have been known
to ruffle a few feathers, too.

04:26.940 --> 04:30.982
( song continues,
lyrics indistinct )

04:38.190 --> 04:40.482
Cut! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.
Cut. Cut.

04:40.566 --> 04:43.607
Baby, baby, baby.
Zion, I'm gonna need one more.

04:43.690 --> 04:46.357
We're gettin'
to the Promised Land
that your name suggests.

04:46.441 --> 04:49.815
You're makin' me crazy.
Am I man, or am I machine?

04:49.898 --> 04:52.274
I already did it for you
like a hundred times, bro!

04:52.357 --> 04:56.232
OK, let's go for 101.
Like the Dalmatians.

04:57.690 --> 04:59.607
Fuck! I didn't
see you guys there

04:59.690 --> 05:01.274
lurking in the shadows.

05:01.357 --> 05:04.149
For big men
we move stealthily--
like ninjas.

05:04.232 --> 05:06.898
Strike like ninjas, too.

05:06.982 --> 05:08.274
So, no more beef?

05:08.357 --> 05:10.357
Oh, the Parker Coca-Cola thing?

05:10.441 --> 05:13.773
That shit's Old Testament,
man, I've moved on.
I'm a businessman.

05:13.857 --> 05:17.316
OK, bigger and better deals--
great to hear.

05:17.399 --> 05:19.316
Yeah. So what's
all this epicness?

05:19.399 --> 05:22.441
Just content
for the channel.
We do more than surfing.

05:22.524 --> 05:24.399
Maybe I should go home,
put my Vans on,

05:24.482 --> 05:27.149
and do some big-time ollies.

05:27.232 --> 05:28.690
( laughing )

05:28.773 --> 05:31.316
Well, that  would surely go
as viral as herpes.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.024
And that's the way
it's got to be.

05:33.107 --> 05:35.399
We've got to stay relevant
and keep reinventing ourselves.

05:35.482 --> 05:38.316
- Just like you, Spencer.
- Looks pricey. Is it?

05:38.399 --> 05:40.940
I don't carry a budget
around in my back pocket, Joe.

05:41.024 --> 05:45.107
OK, well, I'm gonna go
pick up Vernon and Reggie
at the airport,

05:45.190 --> 05:48.399
and maybe you can stay
and help him produce
this whole thing.

05:48.482 --> 05:51.898
Yeah, high school is
retiring Vernon Littelfield's
number today.

05:51.982 --> 05:55.732
Oh! Well, congratulations.
Tell Vernon congratulations

05:55.815 --> 05:58.399
from all of us here
at Sports X.

05:59.857 --> 06:01.107
- Have fun.
- All right, man.

06:01.190 --> 06:02.316
Talk to you later.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.857
Lance, buddy,

06:08.940 --> 06:10.773
I sense a little
defensiveness.

06:10.857 --> 06:15.357
I don't like to let
money get in the way
of creating art, Joe.

06:15.441 --> 06:18.316
Well, we don't let
art get in the way
of creating money.

06:18.399 --> 06:20.524
( laughs ) Jesse!

06:20.607 --> 06:23.857
Can you take this guy to craft,
get him some sushi or something,

06:23.940 --> 06:26.357
load it up with salmonella,
so he knows what it's like

06:26.441 --> 06:28.107
to be disrupted while
he's trying to work.

06:28.190 --> 06:29.566
OK, got it.
Hey, dude.

06:29.648 --> 06:31.857
- Hey, Cheese.
- Is it usually like this?

06:31.940 --> 06:34.690
No, it's usually an iPhone
at the Berrics.

06:34.773 --> 06:36.648
I'll show you were
the espresso is.

06:36.732 --> 06:37.607
Yeah.

06:41.149 --> 06:42.024
All right, man.

06:43.149 --> 06:44.482
Y'all be good.

06:46.316 --> 06:48.024
- What up, Spence.
- Vern.

06:48.107 --> 06:51.399
Don't forget
to read that book
about Lucky Luciano.

06:51.482 --> 06:54.232
Watch the doc too,
the one where he dies
in the end.

06:54.316 --> 06:55.982
Will do, paisan.

06:56.065 --> 06:57.898
- Ciao.
- Be good, goodfellas.

06:57.982 --> 07:00.648
Spence, see how responsible
I've become?

07:00.732 --> 07:02.232
- We're jetting smarter.
- Yes, you are.

07:02.316 --> 07:03.982
Appreciate the effort, Vern,
but look, if that means

07:04.065 --> 07:06.190
you're gonna get
implicated in the next
racketeering sting,

07:06.274 --> 07:08.482
I'd rather you guys
fly yourself.

07:08.566 --> 07:10.357
Ready for your big coronation?

07:10.441 --> 07:12.441
It's just the high school
retiring my jersey, Spence.

07:12.524 --> 07:14.399
- That's what I said.
- Shut up, Reggie.

07:14.482 --> 07:16.190
- It's an honor.
- Just sayin',

07:16.274 --> 07:18.399
every time we go back home,
everybody's got their hand out.

07:18.482 --> 07:20.441
Come on, Reg.
Don't be so jaded.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.399
I can't help it.
I'm from Compton.

07:22.482 --> 07:24.274
Got the right attitude now,
Vern.

07:24.357 --> 07:25.982
It's gonna be the first
of many honors.

07:26.065 --> 07:27.441
You keep playing
the way you're playing,

07:27.524 --> 07:29.024
Dallas is gonna put you
in the ring.

07:29.107 --> 07:30.732
Then you're gonna wear
a gold jacket.

07:30.815 --> 07:33.441
Hopefully, my bust
will be next to yours.

07:33.524 --> 07:35.607
Yeah, and congrats
on the HOF thing.

07:35.690 --> 07:37.065
Wow. Thank you, Reg.

07:37.149 --> 07:39.274
Good. Now can we stop
jerkin' each other off

07:39.357 --> 07:42.190
and get in and out of L.A.
with some money left
in our pockets?

07:44.857 --> 07:47.732
( chatter )

07:47.815 --> 07:50.441
Fuck, man, what happened
to Tiffany? I thought
that was your girl.

07:50.524 --> 07:52.982
She is, you know
what I'm sayin'?

07:53.065 --> 07:56.607
Tiff's my girl  girl, bro.
But she gets seasick.

07:56.690 --> 07:58.857
Don't say nothin'.
I don't want to spook Tasha.

07:58.940 --> 08:01.566
- She old work.
- I ain't sayin' shit.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.190
I know you got me.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.898
How long you been
fuckin' with Donna,
anyway?

08:05.982 --> 08:08.316
I don't know,
six months or so.

08:08.399 --> 08:10.940
That's cool.
She cool. Good vibes.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.316
- How do you know her again?
- On the scene.

08:14.399 --> 08:18.399
- That's cool.
- Yep.

08:18.482 --> 08:21.232
I feel like you're not
telling me something.

08:21.316 --> 08:23.648
- You feel that way?
- I do.

08:23.732 --> 08:25.773
I'm gonna tell you
how it is, bro, straight up.

08:25.857 --> 08:27.773
'Cause you my boy
and I got love for you.

08:27.857 --> 08:29.607
- You fucked my girl.
- Hell, no!

08:29.690 --> 08:31.982
- Oh, my God.
- I ain't fuck her, bro.

08:32.065 --> 08:35.566
She bad and all,
but that ain't my kind of ass.
That's some white girl shit.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.815
Babe, think you could
take a picture of us?

08:37.898 --> 08:40.690
- No.
- That's so rude.

08:40.773 --> 08:42.773
So what the fuck
you gotta tell me
straight up?

08:42.857 --> 08:45.773
- She got with my boy.
- What boy?

08:45.857 --> 08:49.399
If I tell you this shit,
I need your word you're
not gonna say nothing.

08:49.482 --> 08:50.982
Straight up omertà.

08:51.065 --> 08:53.399
Omertà, yeah, OK.
This isn't The Godfather.

08:53.482 --> 08:56.399
You got my word.
Just fuckin' tell me.

08:56.482 --> 08:57.773
Tiger.

08:57.857 --> 09:00.274
She fucked Tiger Woods?

09:00.357 --> 09:03.607
Fore! Hole-in-one, nigga.

09:06.441 --> 09:09.648
TTD: Man! You're having a go
for the Rams. This is sick!

09:09.732 --> 09:11.274
All right, Andrew,
let's be gentle with him.

09:11.357 --> 09:13.357
He gonna be more skittish
than a rescue dog.

09:13.441 --> 09:14.773
I should get
a rescue dog.

09:14.857 --> 09:16.316
You should get
a therapy dog.

09:16.399 --> 09:20.024
Black swan. I appreciate
you agreeing to come here

09:20.107 --> 09:21.648
and being discreet
about it.

09:21.732 --> 09:23.898
And I appreciate you agreeing
to come work out for me.

09:23.982 --> 09:27.024
I'm so happy
the mutual admiration society
is alive and well.

09:27.107 --> 09:29.898
Don't look nervous, man.
I got this, baby.

09:29.982 --> 09:31.690
- I know. I know.
- Who's Urkel?

09:31.773 --> 09:34.357
That's Andrew,
my assistant.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.690
- This is TTD.
- Don't be disrespectful, T.

09:36.773 --> 09:38.316
- Good to meet you.
- Thank you.

09:38.399 --> 09:39.732
He's gonna be the timer.

09:39.815 --> 09:41.357
Look, I hope you understand,
you know,

09:41.441 --> 09:43.898
it just can't look like
I'm jamming you on nobody.

09:43.982 --> 09:46.190
- Yeah.
- Well, you sure aren't.

09:46.274 --> 09:48.316
That's what we're doing, right?
Talkin' like white people?

09:48.399 --> 09:51.274
Let's keep it real, man.
You can wake Rick up in
the middle of a threesome

09:51.357 --> 09:54.107
and he gonna snatch balls
one-handed like O.B.J.

09:54.190 --> 09:57.566
Paws on the balls,
but I am ready to work out.

09:57.648 --> 10:00.232
- What we gonna do first,
routes?
- Yeah, routes up first.

10:00.316 --> 10:02.524

this mornin'!

10:23.524 --> 10:26.857
Relax, TTD.
Calm down.
He'll be all right.

10:26.940 --> 10:28.482
Charles:
Good, good.

10:30.399 --> 10:32.648
- TTD: Come on, Rick.
- Arggh!

10:32.732 --> 10:35.399
I'm feeling a little off.
It might be the meds.

10:35.482 --> 10:38.107

10:43.607 --> 10:45.065
I just ain't used
to playing with 'em.

10:45.149 --> 10:47.357
You know what?
Let's go hit the forty.

10:47.441 --> 10:49.316
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's do that.

10:54.815 --> 10:56.399

10:56.482 --> 10:58.648

TTD:
Let me see that watch, Urkel.

11:27.648 --> 11:30.482
God damn,  man!
We never gonna get out
of that house.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.732
I told him he shouldn't have
took time off to retire.

11:32.815 --> 11:35.316
Comebacks ain't easy.
I know.

11:35.399 --> 11:38.399

( chatter, phones ringing )

11:55.274 --> 11:57.149
Enid. Hey. Hi.

11:57.232 --> 11:58.857
I was just passing by,
I had to tell you,

11:58.940 --> 12:00.773
you look beautiful today.

12:00.857 --> 12:03.773
You really do. You know?
I love what you've done
with your hair.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.607
And I love what
you've done with yours, Joe.

12:06.690 --> 12:09.357
( laughs )
Why you so happy today?

12:09.441 --> 12:11.982
Somebody steal your lighter?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.690
I work in accounting, Joe.

12:13.773 --> 12:16.857
Everyone who works in accounting
is fucking miserable.

12:16.940 --> 12:19.690
- Did you not get that memo?
- No, I didn't.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.274
I love accounting.
Gets my blood pumping.

12:22.357 --> 12:26.732
For real. I get a real rush
when I'm crunching numbers,
movin' decimal points...

12:26.815 --> 12:29.441
- Fractions do it for me.
- Fractions are OK.

12:29.524 --> 12:32.065
- Now, what do you need, Joe?
- Oh, no. Nothing. Nothing.

12:32.149 --> 12:34.607
I was just down at
the shoot with Lance, and--

12:34.690 --> 12:36.399
Impressive. The scope of it.

12:36.482 --> 12:38.898
It reminded me of the first time
I saw Cats  on Broadway.

12:38.982 --> 12:42.065
- You ever see Cats?
- I have. The original cast.

12:42.149 --> 12:44.107
I used to have the unitard.

12:44.190 --> 12:47.232
Ho ho! Betcha
you turned some heads.

12:47.316 --> 12:49.274
I like you.

12:49.357 --> 12:53.107
Good. I'm glad.
Because, uh...

12:53.190 --> 12:56.441
I gotta ask you,
how much did that video cost?

12:56.524 --> 12:58.607
- ( sighs )
- Besides too much.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.316
I'm guessin' around 300K?

13:00.399 --> 13:03.940
I'm not allowed
to discuss this budget, Joe.

13:04.024 --> 13:06.441
Lance has sworn me to secrecy.

13:06.524 --> 13:09.441
Enid, oh, but it's me.

13:09.524 --> 13:11.773
It's your best friend, Joe.

13:11.857 --> 13:15.648
But if I were to turn around
to the printer

13:15.732 --> 13:19.566
and someone were to open
that top drawer,

13:19.648 --> 13:22.857
he might find a budget
he could take a peek at.

13:26.232 --> 13:27.524
My hero.

13:31.357 --> 13:35.149
Oh, you gotta be
fucking kidding me!

13:35.232 --> 13:37.732
Enid, this looks like
a fuckin' military contract.

13:37.815 --> 13:39.648
Is there bid-rigging
involved here?

13:39.732 --> 13:41.149
Are you taking bribes
under the table?

13:41.232 --> 13:43.357
Don't attack my integrity, Joe.

13:43.441 --> 13:47.190
A million dollars
on a fuckin' skateboard video?!

13:47.274 --> 13:50.107
I thought those things
are suppose to be
street-level.

13:50.190 --> 13:53.690
They usually are,
but for some reason,
this one's different.

13:53.773 --> 13:56.482
He seems to have
some kind of bug up his ass,

13:56.566 --> 13:57.815
a giant  one.

13:57.898 --> 14:00.232
I tried to ask about it,

14:00.316 --> 14:02.232
but he went
full 'roid rage on me.

14:02.316 --> 14:04.024
Do you know what
that boy told me?

14:04.107 --> 14:06.190
That I should
start smoking pot.

14:06.274 --> 14:07.316
So I did.

14:07.399 --> 14:09.815
Wasn't expecting that.

14:09.898 --> 14:12.482
OK, all right. Enid...

14:12.566 --> 14:15.149
stop cutting checks
as of right now.

14:15.232 --> 14:16.732
No one cuts a check

14:16.815 --> 14:20.024
unless Spencer or myself
approves it. Understood?

14:20.107 --> 14:22.190
- Understood.
- Great.

14:22.274 --> 14:25.149
Great. Thanks.
Good talk, Enid. Bye.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.482
It's not the way
I remember high school,

14:28.566 --> 14:30.815
but I appreciate
the vintage throwback look.
Right on, brutha.

14:30.898 --> 14:32.690
That's not style.
That's some motherfucker

14:32.773 --> 14:34.107
too broke
to get his hair cut.

14:34.190 --> 14:35.940
Reg, you gonna
be positive today?

14:36.024 --> 14:37.857
'Cause if not,
I'll leave your ass
in the car.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.399
With the windows up.
How about you try

14:39.482 --> 14:41.316
and be the "glass half full"
kind of guy today?

14:41.399 --> 14:42.857
Yo, Spence, man,
look around, man.

14:42.940 --> 14:44.982
The only thing half full
in the 'hood is a 40-ouncer.

14:45.065 --> 14:48.898
They tryin' to reel us in.
Man, I know he up to something.

14:48.982 --> 14:50.857
The pride of Compton
returns.

14:50.940 --> 14:52.940
Mr. Hags.
What's goin' on, man?

14:53.024 --> 14:54.566
I want you to meet Spencer.

14:54.648 --> 14:57.149
This is my financial guru
and all-around great guy.

14:57.232 --> 14:58.773
Mr. Hagerty,
real pleasure
to meet you.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.316
Nothing more important to me
than quality education.

15:01.399 --> 15:03.107
Then you in
the wrong place.

15:03.190 --> 15:04.898
It's nice to see you, too,
Reginald.

15:04.982 --> 15:06.898
Believe it or not,
I always knew

15:06.982 --> 15:08.482
both these boys
would make it out.

15:08.566 --> 15:10.524
What do you want,
Mr. Hags?

15:10.607 --> 15:12.316
You've never been
this nice to me before.

15:12.399 --> 15:15.107
( laughs )
Come on, guys.

15:15.190 --> 15:18.065
Glass half full, Reggie.
Half full.

15:18.149 --> 15:20.399
Place hasn't changed too much,
huh, Mr. Hags?

15:20.482 --> 15:22.648
Sadly, it has--
for the worse,

15:22.732 --> 15:25.107
which is what I wanted
to discuss with you.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.566
I knew it was somethin'.

15:26.648 --> 15:29.149
- ( phone chiming )
- Sorry about that.

15:30.357 --> 15:33.690
- ( chiming )
- My apologies.

15:33.773 --> 15:35.773
What's the problem, Joe?

15:35.857 --> 15:37.732
Hey, finally.
My God.

15:37.815 --> 15:39.898
Um, are you alone right now?

15:39.982 --> 15:42.773
- What difference
does that make?
- It's sensitive, OK?

15:42.857 --> 15:45.441
I'm with Vernon
and his principal.
Hold on one second.

15:45.524 --> 15:47.898
- Excuse me.
- Is Vern in trouble?

15:47.982 --> 15:49.024
He is not. Are you?

15:49.107 --> 15:50.607
Let me start by saying

15:50.690 --> 15:52.607
how much I love and appreciate
our partnership.

15:52.690 --> 15:55.149
This doesn't sound good.
What'd you do, Joe?

15:55.232 --> 15:57.982
Believe it or not,
I didn't do anything.

15:58.065 --> 16:01.190
But it turns out
that our guy Lance--

16:01.274 --> 16:03.107
Your  guy Lance.
Your guy.

16:03.190 --> 16:05.107
Yeah, yeah. My guy Lance

16:05.190 --> 16:08.232
has been spending
like a coked-up sailor
in a whorehouse on this video.

16:08.316 --> 16:10.773
- How bad is it?
- Over a million.

16:10.857 --> 16:12.316
And apparently
this is something new.

16:12.399 --> 16:15.107
He's usually very
budget-conscious.

16:15.190 --> 16:18.149
So you think Mr. No Beef
is trying to tell us
to go fuck ourselves?

16:18.232 --> 16:20.690
That thought
has crossed my mind, yeah.

16:20.773 --> 16:22.815
There's only one guy
who can answer our questions.
Where is he?

16:22.898 --> 16:26.732
Jesse said he's
finishing up the shoot
somewhere in the desert.

16:26.815 --> 16:28.773
What is he,
David fuckin' Fincher now?

16:28.857 --> 16:30.024
I'll see you soon.

16:30.107 --> 16:33.024
( R&B music playing )

16:35.357 --> 16:36.357
Hey.

16:37.566 --> 16:39.149
Hey.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.566
Where you been all day?

16:41.648 --> 16:43.524
Uh, uh, runnin' errands.

16:43.607 --> 16:45.690
What kind of errands? Besides,
ain't that your job, TTD?

16:45.773 --> 16:48.940
- Job?
- Not when somebody's
special birthday is comin' up.

16:49.024 --> 16:50.898
Oh, so you were
shopping for my birthday.

16:50.982 --> 16:52.524
That's three months away.

16:52.607 --> 16:54.732
So where'd you go,
Equinox?

16:54.815 --> 16:57.732
- Equinox?
- Why would I go to Equinox
for your birthday gift, baby?

16:57.815 --> 16:59.898
You don't need a gym membership.
Look at you. You're perfect.

16:59.982 --> 17:02.482
You been sweatin'
your ass off, Ricky.
Don't lie to me. I can tell.

17:02.566 --> 17:05.898
- She's got good senses.
- The sweat thing is my fault.

17:05.982 --> 17:07.441
I had him stop for a hike

17:07.524 --> 17:09.773
because as you know,
I'm trying to lose weight.

17:09.857 --> 17:11.399
Yeah, well,
it ain't workin', TTD.

17:11.482 --> 17:12.607
And if you went on a hike,

17:12.690 --> 17:14.190
how come you  ain't sweatin'?

17:14.274 --> 17:16.482
- I have glandular issues?
- That's a lie.

17:16.566 --> 17:18.190
Who are you, Robert Mueller?

17:18.274 --> 17:20.399
- Tell me the truth, TTD.
- Don't answer that.

17:20.482 --> 17:22.274
You better answer me
if you want to stay
in this house.

17:22.357 --> 17:23.482
Baby,
don't threaten my friend.

17:23.566 --> 17:26.065
Technically,
I'm both your friends.

17:26.149 --> 17:28.232
I'd like to keep it that way.

17:29.566 --> 17:32.524
Go ahead and tell her,
snitch.

17:32.607 --> 17:34.024
Ricky worked out
for the Rams.

17:34.107 --> 17:36.316
You went and tried out
for Charles?

17:36.399 --> 17:38.690
Yeah, but I-I was ashamed.
That's why I didn't say nothin'.

17:38.773 --> 17:41.773
You did more
than not tell me.
You just straight-up lied.

17:41.857 --> 17:43.399
Babe, l-listen--

17:45.190 --> 17:46.982
You never gonna win that.

17:47.065 --> 17:48.732
Pussy's undefeated.

17:48.815 --> 17:50.773
It's undefeated.

17:58.107 --> 18:00.190
Look at the windmills,
look at the windmills...

18:00.274 --> 18:03.357
Again, again, again
with the windmills.
Come on.

18:03.441 --> 18:05.232
You're stressed.

18:05.316 --> 18:06.940
- You think so?
- Yes.

18:07.024 --> 18:08.898
Look, once we get Sports X
up and running,

18:08.982 --> 18:10.690
I want you to go away
and recharge.

18:10.773 --> 18:13.566
I want you
to think about a vacation
in a beautiful locale.

18:13.648 --> 18:16.065
Well, OK, we're headed to one.

18:16.149 --> 18:18.482
Well, after we're done
meeting with Lance,

18:18.566 --> 18:20.232
I'm gonna leave you
so you get your R&R.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.898
OK, all right.

18:21.982 --> 18:25.149
You're not exactly
the beacon of mental health
either, my friend.

18:25.232 --> 18:27.107
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Maybe I should drop you off

18:27.190 --> 18:28.982
at the Betty Ford Clinic
in Rancho Mirage.

18:29.065 --> 18:32.607
It's the original franchise.
Only the best for you.

18:32.690 --> 18:34.773
Well, it's a waste
of time for me, OK?

18:34.857 --> 18:36.940
Plus, I don't have
substance abuse issues.

18:37.024 --> 18:38.607
Oh ho! Really?

18:38.690 --> 18:40.648
Oh, wow.
No sex addiction?

18:40.732 --> 18:42.648
That's
not a valid addiction.

18:42.732 --> 18:44.940
That's opportunity
and appetite.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.898
- Alcohol? Pain meds?
- No, no, no.

18:47.982 --> 18:51.065
I enjoy them.
I don't need  them.
There's a big difference.

18:51.149 --> 18:53.898
Delusional. Check.
What about depression?

18:53.982 --> 18:56.024
I'm not depressed. No.

18:56.107 --> 18:58.773
I am a little tortured,
but not depressed.

18:58.857 --> 19:03.024
OK. Finally, an admission,
some self-awareness.

19:03.107 --> 19:06.982
That, my friend,
that is the first step
on the road to recovery.

19:07.065 --> 19:08.982
So does that mean
you're ready to talk now?

19:09.065 --> 19:11.232
Or are you just gonna
keep avoiding it?

19:11.316 --> 19:13.149
There's a lot of shit
in my head, Joe.

19:13.232 --> 19:16.566
Well, that is not
a healthy way to exist.
Take it from me, I know.

19:16.648 --> 19:19.898
Well, suicide doesn't only
kill the person who commits it,

19:19.982 --> 19:22.566
it also kills the ones
they left behind.

19:24.566 --> 19:25.815
OK.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.648
So your brother's death
is weighing on you.

19:27.732 --> 19:31.524
Right? You just need
to do a better job
of compartmentalizing.

19:31.607 --> 19:34.566
You should do what I did
after my wife died.

19:34.648 --> 19:36.815
- Celebrate?
- ( laughs ) No, no.

19:36.898 --> 19:38.732
No, no, no,
right after that.

19:38.815 --> 19:41.815
What I did was,
I took a small,

19:41.898 --> 19:45.857
very, very, very beautiful
mental picture of her

19:45.940 --> 19:50.190
and I locked it away
in the deep, deep recesses
of my brain.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.524
That sounds
so fucked up.

19:53.607 --> 19:56.107
- Yeah, it sounds so  fucked up.
- That's why you have issues.

19:56.190 --> 19:58.441
It sounded OK
when I was just thinking it,

19:58.524 --> 20:00.607
but when I said it out loud,
it didn't sound as good.

20:00.690 --> 20:02.940
How about this?
Why don't we just go
take care of business,

20:03.024 --> 20:05.316
and then after that,
we'll go take care of us.

20:05.399 --> 20:08.190
Me and you, two for one,
Betty Ford.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.399
Oh, my God.
Couples Betty Ford?

20:10.482 --> 20:12.107
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

20:14.316 --> 20:16.065
( coughing )

20:20.566 --> 20:21.773
Excuse me.

20:21.857 --> 20:24.024
Should we get you
some water, Mr. Hagerty?

20:24.107 --> 20:27.190
No, no, it's OK.
Just the asbestos,
that's all.

20:27.274 --> 20:29.815
Asbestos, my ass.
It's from all the Kools
he used to smoke.

20:29.898 --> 20:34.065
Besides, if the asbestos
doesn't get me and these kids,

20:34.149 --> 20:36.898
the lead poisoning will.

20:36.982 --> 20:39.107
You being serious,
Mr. Hagerty?

20:39.190 --> 20:40.857
Unfortunately,
I am.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.065
Lead builds character.
I mean, look at us.

20:44.149 --> 20:47.065
Hey, ol' Reg,
there's our old homeroom.
Let's take a look.

20:47.149 --> 20:48.648
( scoffs )

20:54.107 --> 20:55.898
Reggie:
Straight to the back
like the old days.

20:55.982 --> 20:59.648
Just like you boys left it.
Nothin's changed.

20:59.732 --> 21:01.357
Only much, much worse.

21:02.898 --> 21:04.898
Damn budget committee!
Are you all right, Vernon?

21:04.982 --> 21:07.441
Yeah, just give me a hand up.

21:07.524 --> 21:11.065
Good, 'cause we don't have
proper liability coverage.

21:11.149 --> 21:12.482
OK, Mr. Hags, you win.

21:12.566 --> 21:15.482
We'll do the right thing
and make a donation.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.940
I'm thinkin', like... 5K?

21:19.024 --> 21:21.940
( bell rings )

21:22.024 --> 21:25.773
Great day.
Thanks for bringing me, babe.
That was sweet of you.

21:25.857 --> 21:28.773
Yeah. Kisan,
he's hilarious, right?

21:28.857 --> 21:30.441
He's stupid-funny.

21:30.524 --> 21:32.773
A lot of fun.
He's crazy, too.

21:32.857 --> 21:34.857
His whole crew is.

21:34.940 --> 21:36.857
They always are.

21:36.940 --> 21:38.773
Always, yeah.

21:38.857 --> 21:40.982
You know
a lot of his boys?

21:41.065 --> 21:43.441
- A few.
- How many is a few?

21:43.524 --> 21:45.607
Is this some type
of trick fuckin' question?

21:45.690 --> 21:48.316
No, you said "always crazy,"
not "crazy."

21:48.399 --> 21:50.065
Like you have
some kind of history.

21:50.149 --> 21:52.607
Uh, no, you  said
his crew is crazy, idiot.

21:52.690 --> 21:55.399
I just agreed.
What are you
trying to get at?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.732
Nothing.

21:57.815 --> 22:00.232
I'm just gonna sit out here
and watch the Golf Channel.

22:00.316 --> 22:01.607
Check the leader board.

22:03.024 --> 22:05.274
See how Tiger's  doing.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.773
If you think I'm gonna let you
come at me

22:07.857 --> 22:09.732
with all this passive-aggressive
bitch-like shit

22:09.815 --> 22:11.815
and get way with it,
you got the wrong girl.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.940
Fine. He told me
that you had a thing with Tiger.

22:14.024 --> 22:16.232
- Who told you?
Cheating Kisan?
- What-- When he--

22:16.316 --> 22:17.357
Don't start stuttering
and muttering now.

22:17.441 --> 22:18.857
Yeah, Kisan, he told me.

22:18.940 --> 22:20.524
But he said
not to say anything, so...

22:20.607 --> 22:23.024
We know how that worked out.

22:23.107 --> 22:24.566
I couldn't help myself.

22:24.648 --> 22:26.648
What's that fool doing
talking about my business

22:26.732 --> 22:28.149
when he's rolling around
with some skank

22:28.232 --> 22:29.732
- behind Tiffany's back, anyway?
- Was it true?

22:29.815 --> 22:31.482
You're asking me
if I hooked up with Tiger?

22:31.566 --> 22:33.815
- Yeah, I am.
- Duh.

22:33.898 --> 22:35.773
I was waitressing
at Waffle House.

22:35.857 --> 22:40.607
"Duh." That's how you answer
whether or not you fucked
somebody? "Duh"?

22:40.690 --> 22:43.857
- What is that?
- I'm gonna go home.

22:43.940 --> 22:46.232
Donna, wait. Come on,
I love you.

22:46.316 --> 22:48.815
That's what
I'm trying to say.

22:48.898 --> 22:50.482
I'm sorry.

22:50.566 --> 22:52.441
You're really telling me
you love me for the first time

22:52.524 --> 22:54.399
after we just talked about
me fuckin' Tiger Woods.

22:54.482 --> 22:58.357
- I am.
- You're a sick fuck,
you know that?

22:58.441 --> 23:00.107
And I love you too.

23:04.232 --> 23:07.482
Listen, we don't have
to tell Kisan, though.
Right?

23:07.566 --> 23:09.524
Like I'm gonna say
anything to Kisan.

23:09.607 --> 23:11.607
Come on, you know
I'm cooler than that.

23:14.940 --> 23:17.149
( dance music playing )

23:22.399 --> 23:25.732
- Hi.
- Nombres?

23:25.815 --> 23:27.232
( laughs )
Nombres.

23:27.316 --> 23:29.732
Spencer Strasmore
and Joe Krutel.

23:29.815 --> 23:33.357
Sorry, whose list?
'Cause you're not on Lance's.

23:33.441 --> 23:35.857
Not on Lance's?
Can I see this?

23:40.316 --> 23:41.940
What the fuck, dude?

23:44.232 --> 23:46.065
Hagerty:
I stand before you all

23:46.149 --> 23:48.441
to introduce a young man
who sat

23:48.524 --> 23:50.232
in the very same seats
as you...

23:50.316 --> 23:52.524
Kind of.
You broke the damn thing.

23:52.607 --> 23:55.232
...walked the same halls,

23:55.316 --> 23:56.982
studied the same classes,

23:57.065 --> 24:01.607
and of course,
played on the same field.

24:01.690 --> 24:05.441
With the help and guidance
of his friend,

24:05.524 --> 24:10.732
General Carver's astute
Reggie Morris.

24:10.815 --> 24:14.274
Astute? Man's smooth,
I'll give him that.

24:14.357 --> 24:16.107
You are, Reg.

24:16.190 --> 24:18.607
Maybe I could stand to be
a bit more philanthropic.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.815
After all, I mean,
five grand ain't shit.

24:21.898 --> 24:26.274
I think that, uh,
we can up it a tiny bit.

24:26.357 --> 24:27.316
You sure?

24:28.815 --> 24:31.898
It is with great pleasure

24:31.982 --> 24:35.940
that we retire the number 90

24:36.024 --> 24:39.857
and rename our field...

24:39.940 --> 24:41.566
The LittelField!

24:41.648 --> 24:43.648
( cheers, applause )

24:47.399 --> 24:50.607
( marching band plays )

25:14.107 --> 25:16.190
( music continues )

25:17.690 --> 25:19.607
Hagerty:
All right.

25:23.232 --> 25:24.815
I don't want to stop the music,

25:24.898 --> 25:28.690
but I'm a man of action,
not words,

25:28.773 --> 25:31.815
so I just want to thank y'all
from the bottom of my heart

25:31.898 --> 25:32.773
and say...

25:34.607 --> 25:37.857
I'm donating a million dollars
to the school, y'all!

25:37.940 --> 25:41.482
( crowd cheering )

25:41.566 --> 25:44.607
What the fuck
are you doin', man?!
Are you fuckin' high?

25:46.274 --> 25:48.982
Hey, band, how about y'all
play me something I know?

25:49.065 --> 25:50.607
Please. Come on, y'all.

25:54.857 --> 25:58.107
( band playing
"Nothin' but a G Thang" )

26:13.149 --> 26:14.982
( bong water bubbling )

26:15.065 --> 26:17.857
If you want, I can talk to him,
I sort of speak his language.

26:17.940 --> 26:20.065
Yeah? What's that, douche?

26:20.149 --> 26:22.524
Hey, bro.
Where's Lance?

26:22.607 --> 26:25.232
No clue, dude,
but take a chill pill,
would you?

26:25.316 --> 26:27.274
No, I'm not gonna take
any pills, all right?

26:27.357 --> 26:29.190
Neither should you.
You shouldn't do
any of that shit.

26:29.274 --> 26:31.482
Drugs are bad.
Just say no.

26:31.566 --> 26:33.607
Never chill.
Never chill.

26:33.690 --> 26:35.690
Hey, listen, I know
you're upset,

26:35.773 --> 26:38.399
but there's no need to ruin
everybody else's night,
you know?

26:38.482 --> 26:41.232
A-A-And not all drugs are bad.

26:41.316 --> 26:43.107
I mean, ask Steve Jobs.

26:43.190 --> 26:44.357
He's dead.

26:44.441 --> 26:46.482
Not from taking LSD.

26:46.566 --> 26:48.316
As a matter of fact,
he's on record as saying

26:48.399 --> 26:50.274
it helped with his creativity.

26:50.357 --> 26:52.065
Joe, cut the shit, all right?

26:52.149 --> 26:53.482
Our ass is on the line,
your ass is on the line,

26:53.566 --> 26:55.441
with this fucking company
we purchased.

26:55.524 --> 26:59.316
I'm aware of that,
I just like to deflect
in moments of crisis.

26:59.399 --> 27:00.773
Lance:
Whoa! Fellas!

27:00.857 --> 27:03.232
I'm so happy
you could make it.

27:03.316 --> 27:06.274
Yeah, well, your warm welcome
is a little surprising

27:06.357 --> 27:07.940
considering we weren't
even on the list.

27:08.024 --> 27:10.524
That's an oversight,
I can assure you.

27:10.607 --> 27:12.107
- Administrative error.
- Spencer: Ah.

27:12.190 --> 27:14.982
- Great party.
- If you can't share it

27:15.065 --> 27:18.065
with the ones that
helped you make it,
who can you share it with?

27:18.149 --> 27:21.815
Who's paying for
all the gratitude that
you're spreading around here?

27:21.898 --> 27:23.316
Again with the money.

27:23.399 --> 27:25.232
Yeah,
again with the money.

27:25.316 --> 27:27.524
It's our money,
and we want to know
where it's going.

27:27.607 --> 27:30.357
A million bucks
for a skate video seems
a little fuckin' excessive.

27:30.441 --> 27:31.857
And liberating.

27:31.940 --> 27:34.898
And I can't wait to get
back out there to it again.

27:34.982 --> 27:37.232
You're gonna love it
when it's finished,
mate.

27:37.316 --> 27:38.898
You missed his point
totally, Lance.

27:38.982 --> 27:40.648
( clears throat )
This whole thing

27:40.732 --> 27:43.232
feels a little bit like
a big "fuck you" to us.

27:43.316 --> 27:44.982
Joe:
Oh, no. Come on.

27:45.065 --> 27:46.898
- I can't believe that.
- I'm pretty sure it does.

27:46.982 --> 27:48.024
Lance, tell him.

27:48.107 --> 27:51.149
It's all a matter
of perception.

27:51.232 --> 27:52.940
I've been working
on this video for months,

27:53.024 --> 27:55.024
and when I get a chance
to spend more of your money,

27:55.107 --> 27:57.732
I'll gleefully take it.

27:57.815 --> 27:59.773
Hence the added scope.

27:59.857 --> 28:03.024
Yeah, yeah.
Hence the added scope--
after-party.

28:03.107 --> 28:05.357
Exactly! We're finally
on the same page.

28:05.441 --> 28:07.773
Feels a little bit
like insubordination.

28:07.857 --> 28:09.024
- Wouldn't you say?
- Yeah, Lance,

28:09.107 --> 28:10.940
you gotta get yourself
in check, man.

28:11.024 --> 28:14.274
You come to my house

28:14.357 --> 28:16.482
and you let him
embarrass me like this.

28:16.566 --> 28:18.566
Gentlemen, you need to
keep yourselves in check.

28:18.648 --> 28:21.524
I'll remind you,
I'm not an employee.

28:21.607 --> 28:24.607
I built this company.
I work for me.

28:24.690 --> 28:25.815
I answer to me.

28:25.898 --> 28:27.690
We get that.
We understand.

28:27.773 --> 28:30.024
But this thing has to run
more efficiently, you know?

28:30.107 --> 28:31.441
Like a big family.

28:31.524 --> 28:34.357
Like a giant dysfunctional
fuckin' family.

28:34.441 --> 28:36.857
We pumped a lot of our own money
into this company, Lance.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.065
- Into you!
- Well, then,

28:39.149 --> 28:40.857
I guess you're fucked,

28:40.940 --> 28:42.690
because you bought
the company,

28:42.773 --> 28:44.732
but you didn't buy me.

28:44.815 --> 28:47.399
I'm drawing a line
in the sand, mate, yeah?

28:47.482 --> 28:49.024
'Cause let me tell ya.

28:49.107 --> 28:51.024
I ain't changing.

28:51.107 --> 28:53.190
I'm gonna do
whatever the hell I want,

28:53.274 --> 28:55.190
whenever the hell I want,

28:55.274 --> 28:58.690
with whoever I want,
whenever I want.

28:58.773 --> 29:00.316
Do you feel me?

29:03.149 --> 29:04.482
I feel you.

29:09.441 --> 29:10.566
Do you feel me?

29:10.648 --> 29:13.566
Yeah. Ow.
I do feel you, yeah. Ow.

29:13.648 --> 29:15.982
OK, good.
I want you to feel this too.

29:16.065 --> 29:18.024
You're fired, mate.

29:19.357 --> 29:21.316
