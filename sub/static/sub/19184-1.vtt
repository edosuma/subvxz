05:51.226 --> 05:53.060
Prime Minister Musayev,

05:53.603 --> 05:55.396
if you don't recognize me,

05:55.731 --> 05:58.399
look hard at my face and you'll understand.

05:59.526 --> 06:03.112
General Vasilly Topov
was not only my father,

06:03.739 --> 06:06.073
he was my comrade, my leader in battle.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.200
And now his fight
for the liberation of Pasalan

06:12.289 --> 06:13.789
His army is under my command,

06:14.082 --> 06:15.666
and I will stop at nothing

06:15.751 --> 06:17.251
to make his dreams become reality.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.052
Prime Minister Musayev,

06:26.136 --> 06:30.222
we have occupied
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

06:34.186 --> 06:37.271
The abandoned city surrounding
the complex is under our control.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.401
No longer can we be ignored.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.278
Now, we are the occupiers.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.909
Any attempt to penetrate its borders

06:49.993 --> 06:52.161
will be met with fierce resistance.

06:54.623 --> 06:57.166
The reactor
has been rigged with explosives.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.877
Detonators have been set to 72 hours.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.004
Should our demands go unanswered,
they will go off.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.716
Such an explosion
would produce a radiation cloud

07:05.801 --> 07:07.927
100 times stronger
than the bombs dropped on Japan.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.100
We call for the imminent release of all

07:14.184 --> 07:17.186
227 political prisoners you've held captive.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.690
We call for the complete
and total independence of Pasalan.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.861
Nothing less will be deemed acceptable.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.949
Prime Minister Musayev, this fight
is not only about country and politics,

07:30.200 --> 07:32.368
it is about blood.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.452
Mine...

07:33.537 --> 07:34.537
...and now yours.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.331
We have your children.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.542
Should you ignore my demands

07:39.668 --> 07:41.502
they will be the first to go.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.006
I urge you to act responsibly.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.552
We ask only to be free,

07:50.637 --> 07:53.055
as you would want your children to be free.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.651
Come on, come on, come on.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.613
That's it. Hey, take it easy.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.660
This way.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.456
Okay, come on, come on.

08:19.833 --> 08:24.253
Over there, right over there.
All right, now take it easy. Take it easy.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.258
Hey, easy! For Christ's sake,
there's spare parts in there!

08:30.218 --> 08:31.427
Morons.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.628
Sit.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.770
-How do you feel?
-I feel good.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.315
-Any problems?
-No.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.488
-Do you know where you are?
-Yes.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.408
-Do you know why you're here?
-Yes.

09:37.577 --> 09:41.163
Is it necessary for you to question
the things you don't know?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.249
-No.
-Excuse me, Doctor.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.875
Thank you.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.336
Okay, can you please move
your right fingers,

09:47.420 --> 09:50.256
one by one, beginning with the forefinger?

09:51.383 --> 09:54.009
-Limited range.
-All right.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.469
Okay.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.848
-Do you feel warm?
-Yes.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.435
I'm gonna cool you off.

10:20.203 --> 10:23.539
Very good. You were very good today.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.532
So you've seen the security tape
from the museum?

10:58.616 --> 10:59.825
I have.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.495
You want to describe what you saw,
or shall I?

11:03.872 --> 11:07.416
I saw an armed assailant take
direct hits to vital areas

11:07.876 --> 11:10.961
and still manage
to overpower a security detail.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.839
This remind you of something?

11:14.632 --> 11:17.468
White Tower was shut down over a year ago.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.512
-Maybe it was something else.
-Maybe.

11:20.764 --> 11:25.267
But we should still prepare for the worst,
however remote the possibility.

11:26.436 --> 11:30.272
So, if we assume the worst,
the problem becomes ours to share.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.940
Hypothetically.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.110
So then, hypothetically,

11:35.779 --> 11:37.905
what is our shared solution?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.706
Let's load them up.

12:42.053 --> 12:46.473
On April 26th, 1986,
Chernobyl Reactor Number 4 exploded.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.018
Worst nuclear power plant accident
in history.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.604
The ensuing fire released a plume

12:52.689 --> 12:55.899
of highly radioactive fallout
into the atmosphere.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.652
The city of Chernobyl was evacuated

12:58.736 --> 13:01.697
and has remained abandoned
for over 20 years.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.284
We believe the rebels have set up
their bunker

13:05.368 --> 13:08.203
in one of the buildings adjacent
to the reactor complex,

13:08.329 --> 13:12.541
about two miles due east
from our current position in Chernobyl city.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.881
While the site itself
no longer has enough fuel to make a bomb,

13:18.965 --> 13:21.300
it has 100 times the radiation.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.722
An explosion in Reactor Number 3
would release that radiation.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.058
And now for the bad news.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.770
It appears the general's son has gotten
his hands on some of our weaponry.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.483
Here to explain, Dr. Richard Porter.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.408
In the 1960s, with war in Asia looming,

13:47.243 --> 13:50.537
the U.S. began research
into Operation Black Tower,

13:51.706 --> 13:54.583
what we've now come to call
the Universal Soldier program.

13:56.002 --> 14:00.881
A high-response, self-sustaining,
quick-healing, stronger, faster soldier,

14:00.965 --> 14:04.009
fueled by high-concentrate
nutritional supplements.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.930
A soldier that operates
without conscience or hesitation.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.850
By freezing a human body
with nitrogen-based gas,

14:11.935 --> 14:16.355
repairing it and reheating it
through thyroid and pituitary augmentation,

14:16.731 --> 14:19.983
we were able to revive
a recently-deceased soldier,

14:20.485 --> 14:22.903
and, in the process, improve them.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.781
Programmable and erasable.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.826
One that you can turn on and turn off.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.788
Deceased, as in dead?

14:34.791 --> 14:38.835
That's right.
Five years ago, the program was suspended,

14:38.920 --> 14:42.839
or, rather, replaced by a program
known as White Tower.

14:43.967 --> 14:47.135
Led by Dr. Robert Colin,
under my supervision,

14:47.220 --> 14:51.848
White Tower sought to improve and perfect
what Black Tower had introduced.

14:53.309 --> 14:57.896
Using gene therapy techniques developed
during Dr. Colin's cloning research,

14:57.981 --> 15:02.985
we were able to give our UniSols
a DNA tune-up from the inside out.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.655
The new model was superior
in every physical capacity,

15:07.740 --> 15:09.783
a virtual killing machine.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.161
The next generation UniSols,

15:13.871 --> 15:16.290
or NGUs, as we like to call them.

15:17.792 --> 15:21.336
There was, however,
an incident in a government building.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.216
Twelve dead. Nobody injured.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.761
It was considered to be a malfunction,

15:29.846 --> 15:33.932
though I believe their temperature
had not been properly moderated.

15:34.017 --> 15:38.103
We were instructed to shut down
all the existing NGUs, which we did.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.355
But there was a break-in.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.985
Some things were taken,
including a Series 7 model.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.698
We have reason to believe
it was my former colleague, Dr. Colin.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.701
We suspect
he's been continuing his studies.

15:53.703 --> 15:57.623
Colin's been operating
out of Eastern Europe as a gun-for-hire.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.877
Gentlemen, we'll be fighting
against the perfect soldier.

16:02.712 --> 16:06.089
One who is impervious to injury and pain,
quicker than hell,

16:06.174 --> 16:09.384
and with a nervous system
unaffected by radiation.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.263
We have four first-generation UniSols

16:13.348 --> 16:16.600
that are more than capable
in this type of endgame.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.894
Dismissed.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.817
-You say four, Colonel.
-That's correct.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.488
-I thought there was five.
-There were. Now there's four.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.156
What happened to the fifth?

16:31.240 --> 16:35.327
He's the subject of a privately-funded
program run by Dr. Sandra Fleming.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.621
-Project Phoenix.
-Doing what?

16:38.623 --> 16:40.957
Behavioral modification therapy

16:41.084 --> 16:44.711
or psychological rehabilitation,
as Dr. Fleming calls it.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.466
She's trying to reintroduce him into society.

16:50.885 --> 16:54.763
He was one of the very first,
but by far the best of the group.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.143
Dr. Fleming has been conducting
her research in Switzerland.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.481
I think of escape.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.653
Peaceful feeling.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.118
-Shame.
-Why do you say that?

17:19.454 --> 17:21.498
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.751
Just say the first thing
that comes into your mind.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.461
I don't remember.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.968
Maybe for things I have done.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.764
What have you done, Luc?

17:42.311 --> 17:43.812
I don't know.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.986
I think he's hungry.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.073
Why don't you feed him?

18:11.674 --> 18:13.300
How do you feel?

18:14.886 --> 18:16.178
Helpless.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.141
Maybe you're feeling
the weight of responsibility.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.478
It's what it feels like to grow older, Luc.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.231
Do you realize how far you've come?

18:29.025 --> 18:31.818
Two years ago when we started this,
when you first woke up,

18:31.903 --> 18:34.529
you couldn't remember the day before.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.870
-My head feels full.
-It's just another stage in your development.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.166
We're getting there.

19:04.644 --> 19:08.313
You may have forgotten our agreement,
Doctor, but I haven't.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.607
Consider this my last reminder.

19:10.691 --> 19:15.445
I haven't forgotten, I've been in surgery,
which appears to be quite a success.

19:16.113 --> 19:19.991
-So, when will we do it?
-I told you, I'm gonna run a diagnostic...

19:20.076 --> 19:23.787
I have to guarantee the safety of my men,
as well as my own.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.958
It'll be taken care of.

19:28.876 --> 19:33.338
So you want to wait? Then I guess
the wire transfers can wait as well.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.341
What's the hurry, right?

19:37.260 --> 19:39.094
-Miles.
-Yes, Doctor?

19:39.470 --> 19:42.264
The general's son is growing anxious.

19:42.598 --> 19:46.685
He'd like to be micro-chipped this instant.
It can't possibly wait.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.857
I'm nobody's son anymore, Doctor.
It is Commander Topov.

19:53.776 --> 19:54.943
Right.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.534
I've done it to myself.
It does hurt a little bit now.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.119
Maybe for you.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.625
-Failsafe is active, sir.
-Satisfied?

20:12.086 --> 20:13.461
No. My men.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.966
Fine. Round them up.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.427
Gentlemen, two-pronged objective.

21:44.512 --> 21:47.889
Securing of the reactor site
and the dismantling of the detonators,

21:47.974 --> 21:50.266
and the extraction
of the two known hostages.

21:50.393 --> 21:53.687
Now, we have reason to believe
that the children are being held here.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.355
However, their positions could be fluid,

21:55.439 --> 21:58.650
so we're moving in
on a staggered six-front maneuver.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.152
Disable all communication
and transportation vehicles

22:01.237 --> 22:04.155
that you encounter,
and remember the objective.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.702
If it comes down to either-or,
we go big picture and we take the reactor.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.706
-Are there any questions?
-What if we encounter the freak?

22:12.873 --> 22:14.749
Avoidance, if you can.

22:16.585 --> 22:20.130
-Keep it occupied.
-Is that the best you can do, Doctor?

22:21.090 --> 22:24.426
It's probably programmed
to defend the reactor site,

22:24.677 --> 22:27.178
so it'll stick close to it like a nest,

22:27.263 --> 22:32.267
making it impossible to use high-powered
weaponry in the presence of the explosives.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.229
Captain, your men should not engage
with the NGU.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.441
That's what my men are for.

22:57.168 --> 23:00.003
-It's hot in here.
-Take your coat off.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.511
-We've been here before?
-Every week.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.681
That's what I thought.

23:12.266 --> 23:16.227
-Can I get you guys some coffee?
-Yeah, sure, I'll have some coffee, thanks.

23:16.312 --> 23:20.065
-What would you like, Luc, to drink?
-Orange juice.

23:20.566 --> 23:23.651
Great. I'll be right back to take your orders.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.991
-How are your knees feeling?
-A little better.

23:30.659 --> 23:34.871
I think the anti-inflammatories are working.
We need to get you some more of those.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.249
The weather report said
there may be another snow front on the way.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.627
Could get a couple of inches
over the weekend.

23:40.711 --> 23:44.172
I think the cold weather's
been affecting your joints.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.510
The next shipment should be in
by next week, so...

24:00.356 --> 24:01.439
Luc!

24:03.400 --> 24:06.611
Luc, stop! Luc! No!

24:08.364 --> 24:10.156
Luc, stop! Luc!

24:11.826 --> 24:14.869
Luc, stop! Stop!

24:16.205 --> 24:17.914
No! Luc, no!

24:19.375 --> 24:21.209
No! Luc, stop, stop!

24:22.294 --> 24:23.753
Luc, stop!

24:26.382 --> 24:28.967
-Somebody help him.
-Go! Go! Go!

25:14.638 --> 25:16.806
-Man down! We got a man down.
-Move, move, move!

25:34.283 --> 25:38.036
-Let's go! Move, move, move! Go!
-Come on, come on!

25:51.592 --> 25:55.470
Hold fire, holding fire.
All units proceed to reactor complex.

25:56.138 --> 26:00.934
Repeat, hold fire, holding fire.
All units proceeding to reactor complex.

26:01.477 --> 26:05.188
Copy that. Unit One holding fire.
All units holding fire.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.690
-All systems green, sir.
-Good.

26:11.028 --> 26:14.781
The complex in sight.
All units falling into position, over.

26:18.869 --> 26:23.289
Unit One, Unit Two, two units,
report to the south perimeter. Cover your...

26:23.374 --> 26:25.667
Unit One holding. Contact back.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.545
I'll take the north side.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.758
Unit Two is on the move.
Proceeding to north perimeter.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.010
Unit Two to north perimeter.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.974
Unit Two, hold position in north perimeter.

26:44.645 --> 26:47.355
We're on the south perimeter, Structure 3.
We're going in. Over.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.899
Burke, the show's on.
Send them in and provide cover.

26:49.984 --> 26:52.443
Sir, we have successfully taken out
all lines of defense.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.112
We need to send in two units.

26:54.196 --> 26:58.366
Negative. Send in the freaks.
That's an order, Burke. Pull back.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.368
Roger that.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.454
It's all yours, boys.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.751
Don't fuck it up.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.499
How long before they reach
the Meeting Point A?

27:48.584 --> 27:50.084
Stand by, sir.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.416
There he is. There he is.

28:30.501 --> 28:32.543
-Shut him down.
-I'm on it.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.991
Holy shit, did you see that?
Did you see that?

29:05.494 --> 29:07.745
One is out. Tell Two and Three
One is down.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.998
We need Two, Three and Four to triangulate
on the new position. Do it!

29:42.197 --> 29:43.322
We're gonna triangulate... Come on!

29:43.407 --> 29:45.116
We're gonna triangulate on what's...
Hang on!

29:45.200 --> 29:46.534
Triangulate... Listen to me.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.719
Let him go! Let him go!
Move Four to the reactor.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.971
Have Three engage. Have Three engage.

31:02.736 --> 31:05.780
-What the hell is going on?
-He's too fast. They can't track him.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.125
All right, let's get Four to the reactor.
Get Four.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.336
Four moving to the reactor, sir.
Four moving.

31:41.441 --> 31:44.569
-Sir, approaching the reactor right now.
-Okay, there they are. There they are.

31:44.653 --> 31:48.239
-Shut them down, Doctor.
-Deactivate. Repeat, deactivate.

34:34.281 --> 34:37.533
Complete evac. Send the order.
Burke, complete evac. Pull them out!

34:37.617 --> 34:38.743
-Evac. Evac.
-Pull back now!

34:38.827 --> 34:40.745
-Get everybody out of there!
-Complete evac now. Complete evac.

34:40.829 --> 34:41.911
Colonel.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.623
Tell them to retreat. Get them out.
Get the men out of there.

34:44.708 --> 34:47.501
-Retreat. I repeat, retreat...
-Get them all out. Tell him that is an order...

34:47.585 --> 34:50.004
-You're not coming in clear.
-Sir.

35:22.245 --> 35:25.539
We're under fire. Unit One under fire.
Falling back.

35:54.444 --> 35:55.569
Shit.

35:56.029 --> 35:59.532
Colonel Petrov's down.
Request transportation.

35:59.741 --> 36:00.950
No, no.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.410
Request transport.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.662
Go. Go.

36:04.746 --> 36:07.915
Listen to me, God damn it.
You're coming with me.

36:13.588 --> 36:17.383
Go now. Take him with you. Go.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.391
Take him with you! Go!

36:28.854 --> 36:31.272
Look. Is he coming?

37:26.202 --> 37:29.622
-How's my boy?
-I feel good.

37:30.332 --> 37:34.335
Good. That's very good.
That's my good boy.

37:35.045 --> 37:36.128
Yes.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.423
Magnificent.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.369
That's because
we're gonna give you a chance

38:08.453 --> 38:10.245
to explain the situation when they get here.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.289
-I told you from the start...
-We were sitting ducks out there.

38:12.374 --> 38:14.541
You don't need to tell me.
I saw it with my own eyes.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.502
If you let us in,
we would've taken him out ourselves.

38:16.586 --> 38:18.629
You didn't stand a chance. You never did.

38:18.713 --> 38:23.092
-Hey, hey, come on. Knock it off. Get back.
-You don't have to like it, but it's the truth.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.970
It took on your entire outfit
and forced you to retreat.

38:26.054 --> 38:29.431
One man.
We're talking about a perfect specimen.

38:29.516 --> 38:32.559
One who knows nothing other
than to obey an order.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.520
Something you seem
to know nothing about.

38:34.604 --> 38:37.606
-Fucking knock your teeth out!
-Hey, hey, hey! Get back!

38:47.117 --> 38:49.034
What the hell was that?

38:50.412 --> 38:54.456
"This imprudent act of aggression
has resulted in a swift response.

38:54.916 --> 38:58.919
"We have detonated one of the explosives
around the reactor.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.588
"Consider it a warning shot.

39:02.799 --> 39:06.051
"The world doesn't appear to apply pressure
to the Bosorow bullies.

39:06.136 --> 39:07.970
"They're allowing them to stall.

39:08.221 --> 39:11.306
"You are not doing anything.
Think about your children."

41:37.245 --> 41:39.955
I empathize with your father.

41:40.081 --> 41:41.415
I know how he feels.

41:42.584 --> 41:46.003
You only hope for your family to be safe.

41:46.421 --> 41:49.339
And when they are not you carry it with you

41:49.424 --> 41:50.591
like a cancer.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.928
Unlike me, he can change this.

41:59.058 --> 42:03.270
I would rather die
than see my father give in to you.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.901
And so it may be, for all of us.

42:09.944 --> 42:14.615
Hey. Stockholm syndrome, huh?
Bonding with the captives.

42:15.283 --> 42:16.867
You know, I'm touched.

42:16.951 --> 42:20.913
What's the matter with you, Doctor?
Did the kids pick on you in school?

42:20.997 --> 42:25.709
Yes, yes, they did.
I was asthmatic, bad athlete, terrible skin.

42:25.793 --> 42:28.837
-Don't be so hard on yourself.
-No, no, it's true.

42:28.922 --> 42:30.422
Perhaps I overcompensated.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.549
Yes, we all congratulate you
on your science project.

42:32.634 --> 42:36.261
Now, why don't you go back to your room?
You're boring us.

42:37.138 --> 42:40.307
Hey, you know, kids,
this is an important lesson.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.894
You always have to ask yourself
who's in control.

42:44.854 --> 42:50.442
It's not always the one doing the talking.
Sometimes it's the guy in the background.

42:52.153 --> 42:55.364
I mean, okay,
let's be honest with ourselves here.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.449
You call that an army?

42:57.575 --> 43:00.786
Come on, it's a bunch of peasants
with slingshots.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.830
But just one of my men, just one...

43:04.916 --> 43:06.667
That's all it took.

43:06.834 --> 43:10.921
Now I want you to imagine
an army of men like that.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.175
That, children,

43:17.053 --> 43:18.804
that is real power.

43:21.683 --> 43:22.849
Bravo.

43:25.478 --> 43:27.688
-Very captivating.
-Thank you.

43:31.025 --> 43:34.111
Or maybe your poodle
would like to get a word in.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.989
My poodle. Well, he's kind of shy.

43:37.073 --> 43:40.701
-No, please...
-He's not blessed with the gift of the gab.

43:42.287 --> 43:46.415
Then maybe you can shut the fuck up
and do what I'm paying you for.

43:48.793 --> 43:52.004
Hey, you're the boss.

44:04.559 --> 44:07.144
We think that the main detonators
are over here.

44:07.228 --> 44:09.187
Pull back and encompass
the whole compound.

44:09.272 --> 44:10.814
Copy that, sir.

44:11.232 --> 44:12.232
That's the cooling tower.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.943
If we can get in those pipes,
we can access the reactor there.

44:15.028 --> 44:18.113
It's probably been capped off after
the accident, but it can be reopened, sir.

44:21.242 --> 44:22.576
He's here.

44:40.261 --> 44:41.636
Hello, Luc.

44:44.640 --> 44:48.435
I expect you're feeling somewhat fatigued.
That's normal.

44:49.896 --> 44:52.689
The sedation should wear off soon enough.

44:54.442 --> 44:55.567
Sandra?

44:55.651 --> 44:59.071
Dr. Fleming is here
and has authorized this examination,

44:59.155 --> 45:05.077
so there should be no cause for alarm.
We're your friends. You're home, Luc.

45:06.162 --> 45:09.414
I have a few questions for you.
Please answer yes or no.

45:09.499 --> 45:12.959
-I want to talk to Sandra.
-Just answer the questions.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.798
Do you see yourself as a person
who is a reliable worker?

45:19.967 --> 45:20.967
Yes.

45:21.052 --> 45:25.472
Do you see yourself as a person
who is original, comes up with new ideas?

45:26.140 --> 45:27.182
No.

45:27.642 --> 45:32.187
-Is relaxed? Handles stress well?
-Yes.

45:33.231 --> 45:36.191
-Starts quarrels with others?
-Sometimes.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.069
Yes or no.

45:40.405 --> 45:41.738
Sometimes.

45:44.158 --> 45:48.036
I'm gonna give you something
that will help with your recovery.

45:50.164 --> 45:52.666
I'm gonna make you feel better, Luc.

45:54.210 --> 45:56.336
Gonna make you whole again.

46:10.518 --> 46:11.852
Where am I?

46:20.319 --> 46:21.695
Where am I?

46:33.249 --> 46:36.084
We started him on a mixture of both
psychotropic drugs and ergogenics.

46:36.169 --> 46:37.669
-His system isn't ready for that.
-Methylphenidate

46:37.753 --> 46:39.463
-and mentenolone...
-Please, listen to me.

46:39.547 --> 46:41.006
His nervous system will break down.

46:41.090 --> 46:44.092
You can't reverse years of hormonal therapy
in a day.

46:44.177 --> 46:48.513
It's like rehabilitating a fight dog,
then putting it back to fight.

46:48.681 --> 46:53.643
-This could backfire in a myriad of ways.
-Rehabilitation was never part of his design.

46:53.728 --> 46:55.979
And as you can see,
he's at odds with his nature.

46:56.063 --> 46:58.648
He was created to serve a need,
and he's not doing that.

46:58.733 --> 47:01.693
But now
you're just compounding the situation.

47:01.777 --> 47:05.614
Dr. Fleming, you have to ask yourself
whether a dog, once it has tasted blood,

47:05.698 --> 47:07.657
can ever forget that taste.

47:07.742 --> 47:12.579
There is substantial power inside of him
that I have spent two years regulating.

47:12.705 --> 47:15.665
If you unleash it this quickly,
you may not be able to control it.

47:15.750 --> 47:19.961
Just get him up to speed, Doc.
You let me worry about controlling it.

47:23.508 --> 47:26.218
Listen. You said something
about some pipes earlier.

47:26.302 --> 47:27.302
-Yes, sir.
-You still think you can

47:27.386 --> 47:29.262
-get in through there?
-I know I can, sir.

47:29.347 --> 47:31.348
Okay, we're gonna try this your way.
Listen to me.

47:31.432 --> 47:33.850
This is strictly recon.
Do not engage this thing.

47:33.935 --> 47:35.185
It's not combat. You understand?

47:35.269 --> 47:36.937
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, let's go.

51:28.335 --> 51:30.128
Why is she in there?

51:30.546 --> 51:34.257
Unfortunately, at the moment,
she's the only one he trusts.

51:38.095 --> 51:42.015
You know, in business, as in life,
people are so distrustful.

51:42.183 --> 51:44.434
-They always want insurance.
-Yes, sir.

51:44.518 --> 51:48.188
I mean, whatever happened
to the handshake deal? Am I right?

51:48.272 --> 51:52.025
-You're right, sir.
-Failsafe. Everybody wants a failsafe.

51:52.860 --> 51:56.529
-But where is my failsafe? You understand?
-Yes, Doctor.

51:57.156 --> 52:00.366
No, no, I'm asking you. Where's my failsafe?

52:04.580 --> 52:07.874
-This is your failsafe.
-And why is that?

52:10.711 --> 52:13.713
Because the NGU cannot hurt
the commander and his men.

52:13.798 --> 52:14.964
Right.

52:15.090 --> 52:18.051
But... But he can.

52:18.511 --> 52:20.011
Indeed he can.

52:20.429 --> 52:22.514
-Very smart, Doctor.
-Of course it is.

52:22.598 --> 52:25.892
You see, Miles,
there's always a way around things.

52:25.976 --> 52:30.146
Now, I want you to count his fingers
and toes. No, I'm just kidding.

52:31.065 --> 52:33.900
We've come a long way from replicating
sheep, wouldn't you say, Miles?

52:33.984 --> 52:35.235
Yes, sir.

52:39.156 --> 52:41.074
Happy birthday, my boy.

53:31.542 --> 53:34.168
Colonel, I can disconnect this thing.

53:35.129 --> 53:36.713
That'll tip them off too soon.

53:36.797 --> 53:40.466
Find the kids. Do not engage the freak.
We need you alive.

53:40.926 --> 53:42.302
Roger that.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.880
He's going to do as he threatens, you know.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.384
Are you listening to me?

54:24.011 --> 54:26.638
I have to address the country in an hour.

54:26.722 --> 54:28.514
I can't discuss this with you right now.

54:29.099 --> 54:30.683
You are not alone in this.

54:31.226 --> 54:32.852
You think I don't know this?

54:33.228 --> 54:36.105
Sending in troops
was the act of a desperate man.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.024
That frightens me.

54:38.233 --> 54:39.859
They've left me with no choice.

54:40.027 --> 54:41.152
Yes they have.

54:41.362 --> 54:43.112
Is it right to sacrifice others' children
but not our own?

54:43.197 --> 54:44.197
And what then?

54:44.281 --> 54:45.281
What is proved?

54:47.868 --> 54:51.371
I am obliged to think beyond myself.

54:51.622 --> 54:53.539
Beyond our son and daughter.

54:53.707 --> 54:54.791
Obliged to what?

54:54.875 --> 54:56.876
Your image in history?

54:57.795 --> 55:01.464
If you allow something to happen to them,

55:02.257 --> 55:04.759
I will never forgive you.

55:58.939 --> 56:01.774
I hear two voices.
You guys picking this up? Over.

56:05.362 --> 56:08.489
There's a female voice.
That must be where he's got the kids.

56:27.301 --> 56:31.554
-We don't have all day, Miles.
-Yeah, right. Okay, Doctor, all right.

56:34.183 --> 56:38.603
Miles is gonna run the diagnostic today,
Andrew. Are you okay with that?

56:41.231 --> 56:44.567
-Yes.
-Okay, first question.

56:45.152 --> 56:47.820
You are a punctual and reliable person.

56:49.406 --> 56:50.490
Yes.

56:52.409 --> 56:55.495
You know how to make efficient use
of your time.

56:56.121 --> 56:57.163
Yes.

56:57.581 --> 57:01.501
Okay. Friends find you impulsive
and unpredictable.

57:03.045 --> 57:04.087
No.

57:04.963 --> 57:09.342
You like to spend leisure time relaxing
in a tranquil family atmosphere.

57:10.844 --> 57:11.928
Yes.

57:14.348 --> 57:17.266
You often contemplate
the complexity of life.

57:23.023 --> 57:24.065
Yes.

57:27.611 --> 57:30.029
Andrew, did you hear the question?

57:32.241 --> 57:34.158
-Hook him up.
-Yes, sir.

57:42.334 --> 57:44.001
Okay, just a sec.

57:47.548 --> 57:50.383
Andrew, listen carefully.

57:51.885 --> 57:55.471
You often contemplate
the complexity of life.

57:58.559 --> 58:00.726
-No.
-That's right.

58:01.603 --> 58:04.522
You have to listen, Andrew. It's important.

58:43.437 --> 58:45.229
As the leader of a nation in crisis,

58:45.314 --> 58:50.443
my decisions have been dictated
by a single principle:

58:50.527 --> 58:53.196
to serve the common good of the people,

58:53.280 --> 58:55.364
no matter what might be sacrificed
in the process.

58:55.449 --> 59:00.203
While pride demands aggression
be met with aggression,

59:00.287 --> 59:04.165
humanity depends on diplomatic
and peaceful conflict resolution.

59:04.249 --> 59:08.169
It is therefore the responsibility
of those in positions of power

59:08.253 --> 59:12.715
to question any hard line policy

59:12.799 --> 59:15.051
that threatens survival as we know it.

59:15.135 --> 59:18.346
Therefore, I have authorized

59:18.430 --> 59:21.265
the release of 110 prisoners

59:21.350 --> 59:23.976
in exchange for immediate
deactivation of the detonator

59:24.061 --> 59:26.395
at Chernobyl reactor three.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.898
Over the next 48 hours

59:28.982 --> 59:33.319
all troops will stand down
in ceasefire mode,

59:33.403 --> 59:36.739
as the terms of exchange are implemented.

59:36.823 --> 59:39.784
The remaining prisoners
will then be released

59:39.868 --> 59:42.453
in exchange for the hostages.

59:55.884 --> 59:57.426
It's over, Luc.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:20.783
We might have had our share of differences,

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.578
but it is the result that is important, yes?

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:27.707
Yes.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:33.212
For a world leader to give in to the demands
of a small outfit such as our own,

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:38.092
one should savor
the rarity of the experience.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:40.720
The thing is,

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:46.726
to stop at this moment would be a shameful
waste of both leverage and position.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.937
Yeah, you're young, you'll learn,

01:00:50.022 --> 01:00:54.025
-but now we have to move...
-It is over,

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:59.030
-and that is that.
-That's not really for you to say,

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:03.993
because there have been expenses.
Unanticipated expenses.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:08.581
It's hard to budget these things in advance.
Now, I have an army to build.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:13.586
And, like you said, moments like these
don't often present themselves.

01:01:13.754 --> 01:01:16.088
I don't think you're hearing me.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:24.722
You want to fuck around?
Is that what you're trying to do?

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.352
You have been paid.

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:32.605
You and me, our business together,
it is all over.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.191
You want to try to test me?

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:38.235
Easy. Easy.

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:42.615
Who is this?

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:45.451
Vasilly!

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.618
Okay. Very good.

01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:30.496
That's a good boy.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:33.999
We have to go now.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:37.420
You have to finish your job. Then we'll go.

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:42.299
The children.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.680
Can I ask you a question?

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:50.850
No, you cannot.

01:02:51.852 --> 01:02:56.105
You often contemplate
the complexity of life?

01:02:57.858 --> 01:03:01.110
Hey, it's not for you
to ask questions, understand?

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.492
-Andrew.
-Yes or no?

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:13.539
Andrew, you're tired.
You've been through a lot today.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:17.626
Are you a punctual and reliable person?

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:22.173
I don't like your tone. Sit.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.719
-You answer my question.
-I'm not gonna...

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:31.891
How do you feel? Do you feel warm?
Do you need me to cool you off?

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:36.312
-Answer me. Answer my question.
-You answer my question.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:39.648
I'm not gonna an...
Andrew, I want you to sit down.

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:45.654
I need to help... To cool you off now, please.
Sit down. I order you to sit!

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:48.991
Stop it. You have to...

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:51.285
You know how to put every minute
of your time to good purpose?

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:54.163
-No! This is a mistake...
-Are you rested?

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:56.081
Are you happy?

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:59.210
-Stop. Stop. No.
-Yes or no?

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:03.672
You often think about humankind
and its destiny?

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:05.841
Yes or no?

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.137
Who am I?

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:43.963
Be quiet. I'm on your side.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:45.714
Are you one of them?

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:48.634
-Who?
-One of the ones who can't be killed?

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:53.222
Let's hope so. Now come with me
and be very quiet. Come on.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.985
Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go!

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:25.254
Colonel, they've reactivated the detonators.

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:28.257
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Look.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.760
What's the communication status
on Captain Burke?

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:33.012
None.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:36.515
Game's back on.

01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:18.849
Communications are down.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.976
We've got no way of knowing
if anyone's alive over there.

01:06:21.061 --> 01:06:22.770
-What about Burke?
-Nothing.

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:27.024
Is it possible your creation might have had
an episode, Dr. Porter?

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:28.734
It's possible.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:32.237
Thirty minutes.
We're officially at Defcon One.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.406
Where are we with Deveraux?

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.534
As he is right now,
he wouldn't stand a chance against the NGU.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:38.661
Dr. Fleming?

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:41.372
If we proceed with the double dosage
and leave him something in reserve,

01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:44.041
-it's possible we can get him there.
-Then let's do it.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.335
But understand this is your last bullet.

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:50.339
Assuming he survives, there'll be no
controlling him, no communication hookup.

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.091
He'll know only
what he's been programmed for.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:54.802
To find those kids and stop the detonation.

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:57.054
-Beyond that...
-Who's gonna dose him?

01:06:57.138 --> 01:07:00.766
-It's not gonna be safe in there. I'll do it.
-No, I will.

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:02.643
I owe it to him.

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.214
I know what's happening.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:38.137
-What is happening, Luc?
-I'm going back.

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:42.015
I'm going to fight.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.562
Yeah.

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:51.483
I remember.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.160
Give it to me.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:04.872
I'll do it.

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.709
I want to be here with you.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.338
It's not safe for you.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:16.175
It's okay.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.308
Go now.

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:15.317
Go.

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:56.449
Run! Run! Get out of here!
Run! Go, go, go! Run!

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:02.182
Fucking prick.

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:11.733
Fucking prick...

01:18:22.782 --> 01:18:25.033
Keep asking them questions, just...

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:30.330
Trying to get some... An answer.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:34.959
Nothing.

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:38.713
Just a simple yes or no.

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:42.217
It's ridiculous.

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:48.348
I knew I had something to tell you.

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:54.145
It was right there on the tip of my tongue.

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:57.148
Shit.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:03.571
I'm sure I'll remember it in a minute, just...
Just wait right there.

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:08.368
Something so familiar.

01:19:10.037 --> 01:19:11.704
Can't explain it.

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:16.709
You know exactly
what I'm talking about, right?

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:20.213
You understand. You don't have to answer.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.717
We're good like that, right?

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:34.561
We've been over this all before.

01:19:43.404 --> 01:19:45.822
I'm just gonna do something here.

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:16.806
I just remembered what I wanted to tell you.

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.353
Wait a second.

01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:53.426
That's Luc.

01:22:55.596 --> 01:22:59.849
He's just used the booster shot.
Something must have slowed him down.

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.894
We'll get another 20 good minutes
out of him.

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:05.104
I hope.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.719
Come with me.
