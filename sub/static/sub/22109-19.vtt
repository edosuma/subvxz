WEBVTT

00:09.577 --> 00:11.579
(exclaiming)

00:14.748 --> 00:15.883
-Mmm.
-Worth it.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.519
-Totally worth it.
-Again!

00:18.552 --> 00:20.554
*

00:25.226 --> 00:26.594
MARGE:
Dinnertime!

00:26.627 --> 00:28.896
Dad, are you gonna
watch the solar eclipse?

00:28.929 --> 00:31.399
Sorry, but this is
pork chop night.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.403
*

00:37.771 --> 00:38.839
OTHERS:
Ooh!

00:38.872 --> 00:40.007
LISA:
Ah!

00:40.040 --> 00:41.742
Way to go, God!

00:42.943 --> 00:44.878
Huh?

00:44.912 --> 00:46.247
(shouting)

00:47.948 --> 00:49.383
Aah! My eyes!

00:49.417 --> 00:51.419
I told you to use
the cardboard box!

00:51.452 --> 00:54.122
I thought you meant
for standing on.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.695
Marge, you gonna eat
that piece of burnt gristle?

01:01.729 --> 01:03.564
-No.
-Whoo-hoo!

01:03.597 --> 01:05.433
-(chewing noisily)
-Homer!

01:05.466 --> 01:08.035
Did you pour fry pan grease
into the milk carton?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.404
-Yes, but it's not for...
-Just a splash for my coffee.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.441
(groans) I wanted to watch
the eclipse with you.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.576
I can only imagine
what you've got planned

01:15.609 --> 01:17.411
for date night tomorrow.

01:17.445 --> 01:20.381
Date night?!
Marge, if we're still dating,

01:20.414 --> 01:22.883
why in the world
do we have these kids?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.385
-What? (groans)
-Hmm?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.986
Hey!

01:26.019 --> 01:28.956
You need to make me feel
you're as smitten with me

01:28.989 --> 01:30.758
as you were when we met.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.261
Marge, darling,
you mean as much to me

01:33.294 --> 01:34.962
as the sun and the moon.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.765
There was an eclipse of the sun
by the moon,

01:37.798 --> 01:39.933
and you didn't even
walk outside.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.403
Come on, Marge,
you can't be that mad.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.771
-(grumbling)
-Uh-oh.

01:45.139 --> 01:48.942
(groans) Marge wants
a date night this Saturday.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.478
You think you've got problems?

01:50.511 --> 01:53.347
I'm really not liking
this new bar mix.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.285
This Saturday? Is she crazy?

01:57.318 --> 01:59.520
That's when we spray nitrous
in the ant farm

01:59.553 --> 02:00.954
and watch 'em go nuts.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.690
Yeah, here's a taste.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.460
Stupid ants.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.696
Maybe I could have
a date night here.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.464
Sure. I'll make it nice.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.700
Take the paint cans
out of the ladies' room,

02:12.733 --> 02:15.303
just like
the Waldorf Hysteria there.

02:15.336 --> 02:18.306
I don't know what to do.
I want it to be perfect.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.542
I've spent so long ignoring
how she thinks and feels.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.777
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a real crotch-22 there.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.447
You know, Moe, a lot
of what you think you're saying,

02:26.480 --> 02:27.848
you're not really saying.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.850
Well, I got to admit,
I've been doing

02:29.883 --> 02:32.453
a little of this nitrous myself.
(chuckles)

02:32.486 --> 02:33.654
(inhales)

02:33.687 --> 02:36.524
Oh.
(chuckles)

02:36.557 --> 02:38.025
(slurring):
Stupid ants.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.027
(cackles)

02:40.060 --> 02:42.963
*

02:42.996 --> 02:47.368
* My funny valentine *

02:47.401 --> 02:51.572
* Sweet comic valentine *

02:53.741 --> 02:58.178
* You make me smile *

02:58.212 --> 03:00.848
* With my heart *

03:04.017 --> 03:07.721
* Your looks are laughable. *

03:07.755 --> 03:09.223
Aw.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.058
You didn't have to do that.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.761
That and much, much more.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.930
Huh? Huh?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.366
(laughs)

03:19.767 --> 03:21.402
Corkage fee.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.736
$30 dollars?

03:22.770 --> 03:24.605
Corkage is the sum we charge

03:24.638 --> 03:26.540
for opening the wine
you bring, sir.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.343
30 bucks to open a box?!

03:29.377 --> 03:31.612
I mean, nothing's too good
for this lady.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.582
-Play the violin.
-I am just a waiter, sir.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.117
I said play the violin.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.988
(playing off-key)

03:43.791 --> 03:46.794
(playing classical music)

03:49.297 --> 03:51.299
*

03:55.836 --> 03:58.606
(laughs) After dinner drinks.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.141
I feel like
Mrs. Remington Steele.

04:01.174 --> 04:06.079
* Con te partiro *

04:06.113 --> 04:09.317
* Paesi *

04:09.350 --> 04:11.485
* Che non ho mai... *

04:12.820 --> 04:15.556
(both moaning)

04:15.589 --> 04:17.591
(Grampa snoring)

04:19.327 --> 04:21.662
I want you.
I want you!

04:21.695 --> 04:23.964
And I want you. Only you.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.967
Oh.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.136
Ooh.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.139
(moans):
Oh.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.974
What the...?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.976
(knock on door)

04:36.009 --> 04:39.179
-(knocking continues)
-(Homer grunting)

04:39.212 --> 04:43.351
Oh. Sweetie, I-I think
you'd better see who it is.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.654
-(sighs)
-Homer, I know it's late

04:46.687 --> 04:48.789
and you've got your
"Keep Out, Flanders" sign up,

04:48.822 --> 04:51.759
but, uh, I'm sorry, I-I...
(sobs)

04:51.792 --> 04:53.694
(sniffles)
I'm feeling mighty low, sir.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.830
-MARGE: Who is it, Homie?
-It's stupid no one.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.866
Flanders? What's wrong?

04:58.899 --> 05:01.034
Marge, it's date night!

05:01.068 --> 05:02.936
That's a made-up thing.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.439
FLANDERS:
Mmm-mmm.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.174
Lukewarm water.
If I close my eyes,

05:07.207 --> 05:08.942
I can pretend
I'm at the dentist.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.378
(slurps, sighs)

05:10.411 --> 05:12.380
Afterwards, I'll grab
some Flintstone vitamins

05:12.413 --> 05:14.181
and try to knock myself out.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.783
Half a Bamm-Bamm should do it.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.217
Ned, what happened?

05:17.250 --> 05:18.952
(sighs)
I'm out of work.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.589
The Leftorium is no-morium.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.158
Hey, Ned.
I can't hack it anymore.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.127
You want to buy
my side of the kiosk?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.463
I'll get all the people
coming out of Sears!

05:29.497 --> 05:32.199
But I got squat.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.970
People are getting all
their southpaw sundries online.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.507
All I was getting were
right-handed college students

05:39.540 --> 05:41.308
who wanted to experiment.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.810
Don't worry, Ned.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.646
Homer will tell you
how to get a job at the plant.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.581
-I will?
-Yes, you will.

05:47.615 --> 05:50.418
-Because it's date night.
-You said that wasn't a thing.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.487
-Let's not fight on date night.
-Oh, all right.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.489
Call the plant and ask
for Human Resources.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.324
(chuckles):
Oh, thank you.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.027
And as a reward,
you get my famous cocoa.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.936
Now, I assume the two of you
will want a cup?

06:08.969 --> 06:11.371
(sighs)
Make my next one a double.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.180
I cannot be your head
of Human Resources

06:20.213 --> 06:21.682
one more second, okay?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.717
With the verbal abuse
and the physical abuse,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.285
and the lying under oath.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.788
And especially this!

06:27.821 --> 06:30.424
Would you like to be
the new head of Human Resources?

06:30.458 --> 06:33.026
To quote my pet turtle,
"Shell yes!"

06:33.060 --> 06:34.528
Not so fast.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.930
You may have to give me blood
from time to time.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.199
Yes, sir.
My blood's like my attitude:

06:39.232 --> 06:41.435
-B-positive.
-Excellent.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.604
Isn't this great?
We're carpooling to work.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.773
So I can see you
in the morning, at work,

06:45.806 --> 06:47.775
in the evening,
and in my dreams,

06:47.808 --> 06:50.043
thanking you
for saving my life.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.079
Look, Ned,
we're just driving together.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.548
I don't want any "iddlies,"
"diddlies,"

06:54.582 --> 06:56.984
"neighborinos"
or "oopsy-doopsies."

06:57.017 --> 06:59.419
-Okily-dokily.
-Here's another suggestion:

06:59.453 --> 07:01.321
no talk, just music.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.991
Oh, sure. That's why I brought
this CD of Christian favorites,

07:04.024 --> 07:05.993
Magical Ministry Tour.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.962
(rock music playing)

07:08.996 --> 07:11.264
* Pray, pray, heart and soul *

07:11.298 --> 07:13.734
* Stick another dime
in the poor box, baby. *

07:13.767 --> 07:15.402
-Maybe we should talk.
-(music stops)

07:15.435 --> 07:16.770
Well, of course, my friend.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.438
-Want to talk about Jesus?
-No.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.574
-Want to talk about
Ecclesiastes?
-No.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.843
-Want to talk about baby Jesus?
-(music resumes)

07:22.876 --> 07:25.012
* Pray, pray, heart and soul *

07:25.045 --> 07:27.581
* Stick another dime
and I'll pray with thee. *

07:27.615 --> 07:29.617
Let's crank it up to six.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.851
(crow caws)

07:30.884 --> 07:32.419
BURNS:
You'll notice on your paycheck,

07:32.452 --> 07:35.989
we've adjusted for desk rental
and electrical power usage.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.158
(chuckles)
Isn't this a power plant?

07:38.191 --> 07:41.094
As defined by the IRS,
we are a religion.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.532
And that is the last question
you'll ask of me.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.336
I will break you in one day.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.371
Now we're gonna do
a little role-playing

07:51.404 --> 07:52.840
with Smitty and Jacqueline.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.642
Smitty, pretend
you're greeting her.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.143
Uh, have a good one.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.212
Okay, stop right there.
A good one, what?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.649
An unspecified object
is the devil's wordplay,

08:01.682 --> 08:04.217
so I say, "Come and go
with a hidely-ho!"

08:04.251 --> 08:05.819
What a wuss.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.387
I can hear you.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.523
Did you help this wuss
get this job?

08:09.557 --> 08:11.458
I just told him who to call.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.460
And you didn't put in
a good word?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.228
-No.
-You idiot.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.631
A recommendation from you
would've sunk him for sure.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.867
Okay, what happens
if I touch her?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.334
Mm. Go ahead.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.571
Hey, good work today.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.438
This hardly seems fair!

08:27.440 --> 08:30.010
Your behavior is obnoxious
and offensive.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.713
You'll be working for me
in a different capacity.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.081
Hmm.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.350
(video game sound effects)

08:37.384 --> 08:40.654
-What are you doing, Lisa?
-Making an art project.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.557
-You color very neatly.
-Thank you.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.325
Pride's a sin.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.361
(groans)
So is snitching to God, Rod.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.898
I'm Todd. I think.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.265
(crow caws)

08:52.299 --> 08:54.267
(snoring)

08:54.301 --> 08:56.770
Homer. Homer.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.706
Hey, hey!
(shouting groggily)

08:58.739 --> 09:00.107
Homer, you were
sleeping at work.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.742
I had to mop up your drool.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.777
HOMER:
Leave me alone.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.383
To beef up team spirit,
I thought I'd form

09:10.417 --> 09:12.052
a little prayer circle
at lunch.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.254
Um, if you pray at lunch,

09:14.287 --> 09:16.624
aren't you interrupting
God's lunch?

09:16.657 --> 09:20.560
Finally,
someone thinks about God.

09:21.962 --> 09:25.098
(Todd humming)

09:25.132 --> 09:28.401
Um, Todd, do you have
anything else you can do?

09:28.435 --> 09:31.772
-Can I pray for you?
-Ugh. If you do it silently.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.607
(quietly):
Dear Lord, let Lisa avoid

09:33.641 --> 09:35.575
(louder):
the cleansing fire foretold by

09:35.609 --> 09:38.578
the Council of Nicaea
before they got leprosy!

09:38.612 --> 09:41.615
-That's not silently!
-You have such great hearing.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.884
(groans)
I miss Milhouse.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.453
I knew if I switched
from white to dark socks,

09:46.486 --> 09:49.056
things would start happening.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.558
Uh, you wanted to see me?

09:51.591 --> 09:52.926
(sighs)
I happen to know

09:52.960 --> 09:54.762
your father didn't die.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.765
Look, Ned, you have to learn
the way things work around here.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.634
People cut corners.
You have to let things slide.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.939
Let me repeat.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.108
Sorry, Homer,
I can't cut you any slack.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.844
I owe it to you to help you
achieve your potential.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.280
Maybe you could help get me
another job at the plant.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.850
One where you don't have to
show up, like safety inspector.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.786
But you are
the safety inspector.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.620
Then I should really
return these things

10:20.654 --> 10:22.622
that have fallen down my back.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.029
They look like gummy worms,
but they're not.

10:30.397 --> 10:33.300
I can't take it.
I can't take it!

10:33.333 --> 10:35.502
Why can't he be like
our neighbor on the other side,

10:35.535 --> 10:37.671
who we never see?

10:37.705 --> 10:39.206
What's the matter, Homie?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.975
(sobbing):
Oh, no. No. No.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.176
(door creaks)

10:50.751 --> 10:51.785
Eh?

10:51.819 --> 10:54.387
Oh, Lord, it's Homer Simpson.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.656
I forget. Are you seven hours
ahead or behind?

10:56.690 --> 10:59.626
Whatever. I really need
your help with Flanders.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.795
Could you please get him fired?

11:01.829 --> 11:03.864
I feel you.
Thanks.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.066
Oh, I reached him.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.735
So, looking through the records,

11:07.768 --> 11:11.304
I discovered this company has
never given anything to charity.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.973
In fact, it looks as if

11:13.006 --> 11:15.575
we've actually taken money
from charities.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.244
Ned, would you mind

11:17.277 --> 11:19.579
if I brought a few associates
into this meeting?

11:19.612 --> 11:21.014
(chuckles):
Well, no.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.515
-(dogs barking)
-(Flanders screams)

11:22.549 --> 11:23.984
-You're fired!
-Nice boy, nice boy!

11:24.017 --> 11:25.485
You're welcome
to keep any radiation

11:25.518 --> 11:27.054
that seeped into your bones.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.089
Speaking of charity,
call the orphanage, Smithers.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.091
We have some leaks in our pipes

11:31.124 --> 11:32.926
and need tiny hands
to plug them.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.362
Uh, they said they wouldn't
send you any children, sir.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.064
(scoffs)
They have to say that.

11:39.566 --> 11:42.936
I want to thank you, Homer.
You've been a true blue friend.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.105
Can we talk about something fun?

11:45.138 --> 11:47.374
I now weigh more than Fat Elvis.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.943
Well, I know
I got one advantage you don't.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.279
I got Homer Simpson
in my corner.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.948
Um, Ned,
I have a confession to make.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.950
Now don't go
turning Catholic on me.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.119
I can't.
I don't fit in those booths.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.954
Ah, don't worry about me.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.791
I'm sure there's a job out there
for a Bob Jones University grad

12:03.824 --> 12:05.793
who majored in teaching
and casting out demons

12:05.826 --> 12:07.494
and who speaks fluent Aramaic.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.731
-(gasps)
-(dog growling)

12:11.765 --> 12:14.334
Hmm. Wish Mr. Burns
didn't send these home with you.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.571
A word to the wise:
don't be cocky.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.141
Don't say you can lifeguard
if you can't swim.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.610
(chuckles)
It'll come up, believe me.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.214
*

12:27.247 --> 12:29.716
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.219
Make sure you keep at least
five Bibles between you.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.787
Oh, don't got crazy,
Patrick Swayze.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.488
Time to put Baby in the corner.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.024
(screams)

12:40.427 --> 12:43.931
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm. You can't pose
for your cover photo like that.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.801
Much better.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.602
(screams)

12:52.672 --> 12:53.640
(sighs)

12:53.673 --> 12:55.175
(tires screech)

12:57.544 --> 12:58.912
(Flanders groans)

12:58.946 --> 13:02.449
Ned, would you like
to say grace?

13:02.482 --> 13:04.417
(clears throat)
Heavenly Father,

13:04.451 --> 13:07.587
thank you for the blessing
of being tested, losing my wife,

13:07.620 --> 13:10.423
losing my second wife,
losing four jobs,

13:10.457 --> 13:13.760
and losing $23
at blackjack to Bart.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.930
23 chips, so $2,300.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.100
-I'll finish grace at home.
-Can you do that?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.335
Yes, I can do that!

13:22.369 --> 13:26.106
Oh, God, now the apologies
are gonna start.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.441
I apologize
for my tone of voice,

13:28.475 --> 13:30.343
and for the things I said.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.212
And now, as penance,

13:32.245 --> 13:34.814
I will get that skunk
out of your birdhouse.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.152
I don't care what you say,
Marge. We got to help him!

13:39.186 --> 13:40.653
I want to help him.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.323
Good, good.
The ice queen begins to thaw.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.493
Oh, Lord, give me a sign
you're still with me.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.233
Mm. Poor Ned.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.802
It really helps
to eat your feelings.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.805
I've got it!
I know what job Ned can do!

13:58.838 --> 14:02.375
Well, go tell him.
He goes to bed in five minutes.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.812
Ned, Ned!
You should be what Jesus was!

14:05.845 --> 14:07.214
-A carpenter?
-No.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.681
-Fisherman?
-No.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.050
-Foot washer?
-No.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.818
-Wine creator?
-No.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.153
-Water walker?
-No.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.521
-Superstar?
-No.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.357
-Dashboard ornament?
-No! A teacher.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.192
I think you should be a teacher.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.827
Like Jesus.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.795
Lord, should I do it?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.699
And you shall receive it.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.671
He's looking right at us,
and he's not doing a thing!

14:31.704 --> 14:34.741
Duffman hates Duffmankind!

14:34.774 --> 14:36.476
Oh, yeah!

14:40.713 --> 14:44.417
* Up in the morning
and out to school *

14:44.451 --> 14:47.887
* The teacher is teaching
the golden rule *

14:47.921 --> 14:50.924
* American history
and practical math *

14:50.958 --> 14:52.926
* You studying hard... *

14:52.960 --> 14:56.263
I promised I wouldn't cry
on his first day of school.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.099
-(sniffles)
-Let's play the frozen game.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.633
(both grunt)

15:05.505 --> 15:07.941
So, rub-a-dub-dub,
30 kids and their sub.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.809
Let's be friends, shall we?

15:09.842 --> 15:11.945
KIDS (chanting):
Teacher, teacher, you must quit.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.281
You can't teach us math or lit.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.749
There's no mercy in the bunch.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.419
We will make you leave by lunch.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.989
Martin Prince?
Were you in on that poem?

15:22.022 --> 15:24.224
Oh, they paid me.
A gig's a gig.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.892
Well, sir, I'm not scared off.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.927
I got two little wild things
at home.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.666
Now, who can name
the state capitals?

15:33.700 --> 15:36.103
-A dingus.
-(laughter)

15:36.136 --> 15:39.406
Well, in that case, I'm
the biggest dingus in the world.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.674
(laughter)

15:43.176 --> 15:44.944
Okay, then,
let's give Mr. Flanders

15:44.978 --> 15:47.147
a room 4F salute.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.516
(kids clamoring)

16:01.728 --> 16:04.297
Simpson, take the kill shot.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.699
Why me?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.802
-Prove your loyalty.
-My loyalty to what?

16:09.836 --> 16:11.871
To peer pressure.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.145
Bart Simpson, I know you--

16:18.178 --> 16:20.547
we've been fishing together,
we've gone to church together--

16:20.580 --> 16:23.950
and if you can fire that spit
wad after our long relationship,

16:23.983 --> 16:25.985
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.888
Aah!

16:28.921 --> 16:30.390
(groans):
Oh.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.724
(school bell rings)

16:31.758 --> 16:33.393
Last lesson, kids.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.863
"F" is for foolish
and failure and Flanders.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.398
You win.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.970
Yes?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.173
Look, what is your deal?
Do you like me?

16:46.206 --> 16:47.974
Do you want to be like me?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.377
Lisa, I have something
to show you.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.645
-What?
-I made you a little house.

16:52.679 --> 16:56.516
There's me praying.
There's you at the computer.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.718
I made you a saxophone
out of dried macaroni,

16:58.751 --> 17:01.554
and the crackers on the roof--
they're solar panels.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.523
Todd, I had you all wrong.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.158
You're a wonderful kid,

17:05.192 --> 17:07.527
and I'm happy
to call you my pal.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.663
So glad I have a friend.
I'm really sick of my brother.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.365
Okay, that's enough.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.570
What's the matter, Homer?

17:17.604 --> 17:20.373
(sighs)
I think I ruined Flanders' life.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.608
BART:
Join the club.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.210
What are you doing here?

17:23.243 --> 17:26.079
I come here for a G&T--
gumball and talk.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.916
Here you go, pal.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.188
Listen, you've got
to apologize to Flanders.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.090
Why don't you apologize
to Flanders?

17:37.124 --> 17:39.592
You're the one who prayed
for him to get fired.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.395
What? He should apologize to me,
because he...

17:42.429 --> 17:45.532
well, he...
he makes me feel so damn guilty!

17:45.565 --> 17:47.900
All right, I'll apologize, too.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.870
What's she doing here?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.072
Hello.
She's my designated driver.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.249
(knock on door)

18:02.282 --> 18:04.884
Hey, fellas.
What brings you here?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.386
We came to say we're sorry,

18:06.419 --> 18:08.555
and we want you
to go back to teaching.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.223
Oh, with all I've been through,

18:10.257 --> 18:13.059
I've never questioned my faith
until now.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.562
You spit-wadded
my moustache, boy.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.764
I think you could be
a great teacher.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.766
Almost as good as her.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.903
(sniffles)
Thank you, son.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.905
*

18:25.938 --> 18:29.242
Remember, if you can
teach one kid one thing,

18:29.276 --> 18:31.411
then today will be a success.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.413
She never gave up.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.482
-Neither will I.
-Great.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.650
Now, this counts
as a parent-teacher conference

18:37.684 --> 18:39.085
and a Christmas concert.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.487
Well, that's all well and good,

18:40.520 --> 18:42.822
but I got to get those kids
to respect me.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.825
Do people respect God?
No, they fear him.

18:45.858 --> 18:49.762
It's never personal,
just business.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.931
(thunder rumbling)

18:51.964 --> 18:54.167
Just leave everything to me.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.968
-(school bell rings)
-(Willie humming)

18:56.002 --> 18:58.338
(kids clamoring)

18:58.371 --> 19:00.440
Listen up, children.
If you push hard enough

19:00.473 --> 19:03.476
on the pudding skin, there's
a tough cup of vanilla beneath.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.546
-Now take your seats.
-How you gonna make us?

19:06.579 --> 19:07.814
(Bart hums)

19:10.483 --> 19:13.653
I won't.
The good Lord will.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.289
(kids exclaiming)

19:16.323 --> 19:18.291
Haw... Huh?

19:18.325 --> 19:19.992
(whimpers)

19:20.026 --> 19:23.530
The scariest thing is
we don't have a class skeleton!

19:23.563 --> 19:25.532
(screams)

19:25.565 --> 19:28.000
Truly, God is the biggest bully
of them all.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.536
KIDS:
Amen.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.575
Now, Nelson,
I'm not gonna ask you to stand

19:35.608 --> 19:37.310
and read me a list
of state capitals,

19:37.344 --> 19:39.812
but the good Lord
might be pleased.

19:39.846 --> 19:43.816
Albany, Annapolis, Atlanta,
Augusta, Austin, Baton Rouge...

19:43.850 --> 19:45.352
(school bell rings)

19:45.385 --> 19:47.420
Does the Lord hear
the bell up there?

19:47.454 --> 19:49.155
Yes, son, he does.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.190
(excited chatter)

19:54.193 --> 19:56.028
Thank you, Bart.
I knew, deep within you,

19:56.062 --> 19:58.531
there was a good boy,
and I respectfully request

19:58.565 --> 20:01.000
that those be
the last two pranks you pull.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.035
You know it, man.

20:09.141 --> 20:10.510
FLANDERS:
Wow, they're quiet.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.112
I'm reaching them.
Edna was right.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.181
MILHOUSE:
Hmm. Does that
cute school nurse

20:15.214 --> 20:17.049
know that I'm alive?

20:17.083 --> 20:20.253
Because last time I left
her office, I was legally dead.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.290
SHERRI:
I have to beat Terri
to a training bra.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.625
BART:
I wonder how much
I can sell Maggie for.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.628
HAMSTER:
I'm starting to think this
wheel doesn't go anywhere.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.108
Shh!
