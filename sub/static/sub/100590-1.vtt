00:16.916 --> 00:19.208
<i>In the 21st century,</i>

00:19.458 --> 00:23.291
<i>mankind began colonizing outer space...</i>

00:23.916 --> 00:27.125
<i>expanding the world they live in,</i>

00:27.375 --> 00:30.333
<i>as well as life itself.</i>

00:30.416 --> 00:32.333
PLANET LATIMER

00:53.500 --> 00:55.083
Move! You idiot!

01:12.666 --> 01:14.041
Go around that way.

01:14.125 --> 01:15.500
Get lost.

01:18.625 --> 01:20.166
You little twirp!

01:29.791 --> 01:30.791
Damn it...

01:31.083 --> 01:32.083
The hell are you doing?

01:42.833 --> 01:44.958
- There she is!
- Get her!

01:49.875 --> 01:50.833
What...?

01:50.834 --> 01:52.000
The heck?

01:55.625 --> 01:57.416
Over there, the elevator!

01:58.750 --> 02:01.041
Close... Come on, close!

02:05.458 --> 02:06.416
Damn it!

02:06.417 --> 02:07.625
The fuck she playing at?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.333
<i>Consciousness was digitized</i>

02:33.416 --> 02:37.166
<i>and stored on a device called a "stack."</i>

02:37.708 --> 02:40.625
<i>Digital consciousness
became one's identity,</i>

02:41.083 --> 02:44.750
<i>the body,
nothing but a replaceable vessel.</i>

02:45.916 --> 02:49.833
<i>In an age where bodies
became disposable objects called sleeves,</i>

02:50.666 --> 02:56.208
<i>physical death no longer inspired
any fear or dread in people.</i>

02:56.958 --> 02:59.166
<i>The rich started to enjoy lifespans</i>

02:59.458 --> 03:03.500
<i>that were as long as the stars.</i>

03:16.583 --> 03:19.208
The world's a stage
with players and voyeurs!

03:19.625 --> 03:22.541
If it's all the same,
you might as well dance, come on!

03:24.416 --> 03:28.166
For tea to raise your spirits,
go straight to the left.

03:37.291 --> 03:40.916
If you want to screw a dead lover,
come around back to the right.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.958
We've got a premium sleeve
waiting for you.

03:45.416 --> 03:47.250
Sick of Latimer?

03:48.208 --> 03:52.791
The needlecast behind the dance floor
will send you to another planet.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.333
Here we go!

03:54.416 --> 03:55.767
- There she is.
- The world's a stage...

03:55.791 --> 03:58.125
- Come here!
- ...with players and voyeurs!

03:59.875 --> 04:02.500
This one's been transmitted
from another planet.

04:02.583 --> 04:04.916
Hand him Case 305.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.333
The needlecast?

04:06.583 --> 04:07.583
You.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.083
Get me a mirror.

04:25.333 --> 04:28.083
At least put something on, will ya?

04:28.250 --> 04:29.250
Hey.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.958
Mr. Tanaseda told us to give this to you.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.125
Let me through!

04:48.708 --> 04:51.666
Out of the way!

04:55.083 --> 04:57.708
Boss is worried about you, Miss Holly.

04:57.791 --> 04:59.625
It's dangerous for you to be out alone.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.416
Come back to headquarters.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.583
Let go. I'm leaving this planet.

05:04.958 --> 05:07.541
You can't protect me.

05:51.458 --> 05:52.458
What the...?

06:02.375 --> 06:03.833
Holly Togram?

06:05.416 --> 06:06.583
Come with me.

06:30.708 --> 06:34.875
Liar! You said
you'd needlecast me over there.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.083
Are you listening?

06:38.166 --> 06:39.875
We had a deal.

06:39.958 --> 06:41.708
Mute member three.

06:41.791 --> 06:43.875
- <i>Muting member three.</i>
- Hey!

06:48.750 --> 06:51.208
I see you met my guy, Takeshi.

06:51.833 --> 06:54.500
How does that sleeve suit you?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.875
We prepared the highest grade
soldier's body available there.

07:00.541 --> 07:04.875
Reflexes are good,
but it has a heavy nicotine addiction.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.041
Still get the urge to smoke in VR, do you?

07:08.708 --> 07:10.416
The hand remembers.

07:13.958 --> 07:15.375
So Mr. Tanaseda,

07:15.833 --> 07:19.291
didn't you want me
to look into your brother's death?

07:20.500 --> 07:23.458
I doubt the girl knows anything.

07:23.541 --> 07:27.833
That girl is a tattooist
for the Mizumoto syndicate,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.291
the yakuza organization
my brother used to head.

07:31.666 --> 07:35.416
She'll get you into Mizumoto HQ
without arousing any suspicion.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.916
I don't need her to get in.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.958
I don't doubt it.
You are an Envoy, after all.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.208
However,

07:48.000 --> 07:52.833
the mystery of my brother's real death
lies in the succession ceremony.

07:53.833 --> 07:58.416
A tattooist is needed for the ritual.

07:58.791 --> 08:01.166
I need her to get into the ceremony?

08:01.583 --> 08:04.333
That's right. The ceremony is in two days.

08:04.583 --> 08:08.416
If we miss this one,
we'll have to wait years for the next one.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.541
<i>Mute deactivated manually.</i>

08:13.125 --> 08:14.500
We had a deal!

08:14.583 --> 08:17.416
- You said you'd transmit me!
- Mute member three.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.958
- <i>Muting member three.</i>
- Why...

08:20.500 --> 08:22.000
Adjust display levels.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.541
Your payment is as we discussed.

08:27.958 --> 08:30.291
The grudges against you
in Harlan's World...

08:31.958 --> 08:34.166
I'll make them disappear.

08:37.207 --> 08:38.541
That's it?

08:39.166 --> 08:41.041
What more could you want?

08:43.332 --> 08:45.666
<i>End command entered.</i>

08:47.416 --> 08:53.416
Takeshi Kovacs, the last living Envoy
who brought down the Saito syndicate.

08:53.500 --> 08:57.541
What? You're Takeshi Kovacs the Envoy?

08:57.625 --> 09:01.541
It's been a year since
Quellcrist Falconer and your sister died.

09:02.291 --> 09:05.416
What more do you have to lose?

09:08.083 --> 09:11.583
I'm counting on you, Takeshi Kovacs.

09:30.375 --> 09:31.666
We're going to Mizumoto HQ.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.375
No way!

09:33.458 --> 09:36.916
Plus, Envoys are terrorists.
You're a fugitive.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.166
What do you think you're doing?

09:42.666 --> 09:45.750
If the assassin comes back,
we're done for.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.166
That brat...

09:53.250 --> 09:56.666
What am I, a babysitter?

10:05.625 --> 10:07.708
What's your problem...

10:07.875 --> 10:09.875
Holly of the Mizumoto syndicate?

10:10.875 --> 10:13.375
I'm Gena of UN's CTAC.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.750
I need you to cooperate.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.875
CTAC? What do you want with me?

10:18.958 --> 10:21.375
You were talking
with the Tanaseda syndicate.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.208
They're under strict CTAC surveillance.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.125
I learned about you
from that communication.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.791
Thought we wouldn't know?

10:31.458 --> 10:32.750
How careless of you.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.833
As are you.

10:37.666 --> 10:39.333
I'm her babysitter.

10:39.833 --> 10:40.833
Come over here.

10:52.666 --> 10:55.166
Are you a Mizumoto yakuza?

10:55.708 --> 11:00.875
There's no bigger scum
than gangsters who use children.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.375
Requesting backup!
Second platoon, come in...

11:53.875 --> 11:54.875
Get behind me.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.041
Are they with you?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.583
What do you think?

12:12.916 --> 12:13.916
Help...

12:23.708 --> 12:25.125
A "real death"...

12:25.833 --> 12:28.666
His digital consciousness
won't be retrievable.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.958
His sleeve... it's enhanced for combat.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.291
CTAC and ninja sleeves...

12:39.500 --> 12:41.250
This job can't get any worse.

13:27.208 --> 13:28.375
It's after her!

13:33.875 --> 13:34.875
There are more?

13:36.208 --> 13:37.583
Duck, Holly!

14:31.958 --> 14:33.041
This is Gena.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.625
Enemy fighters have wiped out the unit.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.500
Requesting body collection.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.083
Holly of the Mizumoto syndicate,

14:46.166 --> 14:49.458
why would they target
a tattooist like you?

14:50.208 --> 14:54.375
I'm... leaving the Mizumoto syndicate.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.583
CTAC is looking into
the Mizumoto syndicate.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.500
What's going on inside?

15:02.833 --> 15:05.250
Who hired those mercenaries?

15:06.125 --> 15:07.333
Shinji...

15:08.208 --> 15:10.125
He's planning a coup.

15:10.833 --> 15:14.333
Shinji... The incoming boss?

15:16.208 --> 15:20.250
I'm taking you back to the syndicate.
We need you to cooperate.

15:20.333 --> 15:21.333
No!

15:21.375 --> 15:24.916
Hold on. We have business
with the Mizumoto syndicate, too.

15:25.333 --> 15:26.833
Step aside.

15:30.416 --> 15:34.125
Why don't I arrest you
and hand you over to the UN,

15:34.416 --> 15:35.916
Mr. Babysitter?

15:36.666 --> 15:40.250
Planning on walking into
a yakuza headquarters wearing that?

15:42.500 --> 15:43.583
Damn it.

15:44.333 --> 15:47.708
Neither of us want any more trouble,
do we?

15:48.375 --> 15:49.458
Wait.

15:49.541 --> 15:52.916
I'm not going back there!

15:54.833 --> 15:57.666
<i>Let me go! I want to get off this planet.</i>

15:57.750 --> 16:01.125
<i>Forget it. Tanaseda won't listen to you.</i>

16:06.083 --> 16:09.541
Pretty open for a yakuza headquarters.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.458
They run a hotel, too.

16:13.541 --> 16:15.375
It's connected to headquarters.

16:21.416 --> 16:22.500
Ogai.

16:22.583 --> 16:25.791
Holly. I see you went out again.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.458
I told you it's dangerous.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.166
So is this place.

16:31.708 --> 16:35.416
Thank you both for escorting Holly here.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.916
She's always going off by herself.

16:41.083 --> 16:45.583
The Mizumoto syndicate proudly presents
the oldest luxury hotel on Latimer,

16:45.666 --> 16:48.416
the Wild Geese.

16:49.333 --> 16:52.916
I am Ogai, your guide.

16:54.083 --> 16:56.083
Do you have a reservation?

16:56.208 --> 16:59.666
You can also choose to just dine.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.958
Let me know if you'd prefer that.

17:02.041 --> 17:05.750
However, the karaoke house
on the 11th floor

17:06.125 --> 17:09.125
is only open to overnight guests.

17:09.208 --> 17:10.665
- We hope you understand.
- Holly.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.040
Turn him off.

17:13.375 --> 17:20.165
Ogai RM 62217 can only be
deactivated by Genzo.

17:21.333 --> 17:24.165
Genzo... The boss?

17:24.665 --> 17:30.125
Yes. Ogai's master is Genzo,
head of the Mizumoto syndicate.

17:30.250 --> 17:35.125
Of course, that will switch over
once the succession takes place.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.208
Holly.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.375
So you're back.

17:41.916 --> 17:44.625
I keep telling you not to go out alone.

17:45.541 --> 17:46.916
You must be Genzo.

17:47.750 --> 17:48.833
Turn him off, will you?

17:48.916 --> 17:51.000
What did you just say?

17:51.083 --> 17:54.416
What kind of way is that
to talk to Mr. Shinji?

17:54.500 --> 17:55.791
You want your ass kicked?

18:00.750 --> 18:03.208
Looks like there was no need to change
after all.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.791
Shut up. It's not my fault.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.708
This is Mr. Shinji, our incoming boss.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.625
You better show some respect.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.791
Put the gun away, you bastard!

18:14.333 --> 18:17.833
Shinji. These two are my bodyguards.

18:17.916 --> 18:21.583
They saved me from an attack
where two of our men were killed.

18:21.666 --> 18:23.791
You were attacked again?

18:34.250 --> 18:35.791
This is...

18:40.250 --> 18:41.750
Ken Kakura.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.166
Gena.

18:52.625 --> 18:57.625
That's still no reason
to disrespect Mr. Shinji, is it?

18:58.208 --> 19:00.708
There must be consequences.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.458
Mr. Shinji? Wait...

19:21.250 --> 19:22.708
Sorry about that.

19:23.916 --> 19:25.333
A token of remorse.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.333
No, thanks.

19:37.458 --> 19:40.083
It's too much for him to accept.

19:43.166 --> 19:47.125
Give it the burial it deserves, will you?

19:50.500 --> 19:51.958
You're one lucky guy.

19:54.583 --> 19:55.625
Ogai.

19:56.291 --> 20:01.750
Take these guests
to our most expensive room.

20:05.583 --> 20:11.875
This suite is the crown jewel
of our hotel, <i>Vita Sexualis.</i>

20:15.625 --> 20:20.916
We also offer various kinds
of room service to fit your needs.

20:22.541 --> 20:26.333
It's the perfect room for newlyweds.

20:33.791 --> 20:35.458
Excuse me.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.666
I'm going to see Genzo.
Come with me, Mr. Bodyguard.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.166
I pass.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.291
Lead the way.

20:42.958 --> 20:45.875
Please. Follow me, sir.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.750
So you're Ken?

21:09.041 --> 21:11.958
I'm Genzo, head of the Mizumoto syndicate.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.416
Sorry to be lying down like this.

21:16.458 --> 21:19.541
You can get up.
I can do this part without looking.

21:31.125 --> 21:34.083
In this room, Holly is the boss.

21:47.541 --> 21:50.916
She's been a troublemaker
ever since she was little.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.583
Glad you survived, kiddo.

22:01.458 --> 22:04.625
You're with the Tanaseda syndicate,
aren't you?

22:06.791 --> 22:09.500
Right now, I'm just Holly's bodyguard.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.416
I'm inside the Mizumoto headquarters.

22:13.541 --> 22:16.666
<i>Find out anything about the coup?</i>

22:16.875 --> 22:21.291
Holly Togram claims
the incoming bossÂ Shinji is behind it.

22:21.833 --> 22:24.291
<i>A coup by the incoming boss?</i>

22:26.625 --> 22:28.375
<i>But why...?</i>

22:29.083 --> 22:30.625
<i>Anything else to report?</i>

22:31.875 --> 22:34.083
I haven't killed any yakuza yet.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.333
<i>I'd almost forgotten your motive.</i>

22:39.083 --> 22:41.500
<i>I was surprised when I heard</i>

22:41.583 --> 22:45.458
<i>that an Envoy defector
would be joining a CTAC mission.</i>

22:45.541 --> 22:49.333
<i>But now you are considered a hero
among the top brass at CTAC,</i>

22:49.708 --> 22:51.083
<i>Reileen Kawahara.</i>

22:51.958 --> 22:56.041
<i>Though, I suppose your code name
on the job is Gena.</i>

22:59.250 --> 23:00.708
Good evening.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.083
It seems I've gotten lost.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.500
I'm trying to get back to my room.

23:06.041 --> 23:07.416
Can you point the way?

23:11.208 --> 23:16.125
Your boss Tanaseda
is the son of our founding boss.

23:16.916 --> 23:21.916
This was our second boss,
Tanaseda's younger brother.

23:22.958 --> 23:26.208
Tanaseda is still alive, isn't he?

23:26.291 --> 23:28.250
Using sleeve after sleeve.

23:28.666 --> 23:32.041
He's one of the most feared yakuza
in the entire universe.

23:32.583 --> 23:34.541
Why would a fearless man like him

23:35.000 --> 23:39.291
send one of his men our way
all of a sudden?

23:41.458 --> 23:44.000
What did you come here for?

23:44.791 --> 23:46.833
Come back here, Genzo.

23:50.708 --> 23:52.666
If there's a coup brewing...

23:53.625 --> 23:55.250
you'll want help.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.041
Again with the rumors.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.541
I'm sick of it.

24:00.916 --> 24:02.250
A coup is unthinkable.

24:02.708 --> 24:05.708
There have been attacks, though.

24:08.083 --> 24:09.541
Tell me, Ken.

24:10.125 --> 24:15.250
Do you know why Mizumoto
became the biggest syndicate on Latimer?

24:16.541 --> 24:17.750
In our syndicate,

24:18.708 --> 24:23.791
the previous boss always dies
when a succession happens.

24:24.833 --> 24:27.375
Not just the sleeve...

24:28.125 --> 24:29.833
the stack dies too.

24:31.041 --> 24:32.500
A "real death."

24:32.958 --> 24:36.541
This tradition was created
to prevent any one boss

24:36.625 --> 24:39.750
from holding onto power forever
and ruining the syndicate.

24:40.208 --> 24:43.416
The boss gives his life to the syndicate.

24:44.041 --> 24:48.000
The men also give their lives
to the syndicate.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.166
That is our code.

24:54.708 --> 24:58.750
What's the point of choosing death
in the world we live in?

24:59.416 --> 25:03.291
Humanity has more or less
achieved eternal life.

25:03.583 --> 25:08.708
That is all the more reason to have death
as the foundation

25:08.791 --> 25:11.375
of a giant entity such as Mizumoto.

25:16.750 --> 25:19.333
All right, that's it for today.

25:25.916 --> 25:27.416
That's amazing!

25:27.500 --> 25:29.625
Can you get in anywhere with that?

25:30.916 --> 25:33.166
I'll show you something more amazing.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.041
Come here, you.

25:45.458 --> 25:47.000
One down.

25:50.708 --> 25:52.625
I saw your brother's picture.

25:53.875 --> 25:56.375
He died according to the syndicate's code.

25:57.458 --> 25:58.958
A code, you say?

26:00.708 --> 26:02.750
You don't believe it?

26:02.833 --> 26:05.958
Perhaps if it had only been my brother.

26:06.041 --> 26:12.791
But my father was a wicked man,
the very embodiment of evil.

26:14.208 --> 26:18.333
To think that scum of a human
would give up his life to honor a code...

26:20.000 --> 26:21.541
it's unthinkable.

26:22.250 --> 26:25.541
You believe there's something
behind this tradition?

26:25.958 --> 26:27.583
It seems that way, yes.

26:28.208 --> 26:33.041
That tattooist girl seems to be crucial
to the succession ritual.

26:34.625 --> 26:39.333
She needs to be protected. At least
until the ceremony begins, in two days.

26:51.625 --> 26:52.750
Someone's here.

26:52.833 --> 26:53.958
I'll get it.

26:58.416 --> 26:59.416
Who's there...

27:18.875 --> 27:23.416
What's this, a part of your consciousness
that failed to upload?

27:24.041 --> 27:26.166
What're you doing in here, idiot?

27:26.583 --> 27:27.875
Who are they?

27:29.416 --> 27:30.416
Someone's here.

27:30.708 --> 27:31.708
I'll get it.

27:33.083 --> 27:33.999
Who's there...

27:34.000 --> 27:37.041
It's Dad and Mom.

27:38.041 --> 27:40.166
I thought Genzo was your dad.

27:40.250 --> 27:41.416
Of course not.

27:43.458 --> 27:46.958
Look. Dad was shot in the head,

27:47.333 --> 27:49.708
and Mom's stack is intact, too.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.041
They haven't found the stacks?

27:53.125 --> 27:55.208
They're both still alive.

27:56.166 --> 28:00.958
You need Mizumoto's help
to find your parents' stacks?

28:02.541 --> 28:05.750
Genzo says he'll help look for them.

28:06.750 --> 28:10.041
But I can't bear it any longer.

28:14.833 --> 28:17.208
You should delete this data.

28:17.708 --> 28:19.291
How can I?

28:20.041 --> 28:22.708
You're just clinging to the memory
of dead people.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.500
Let's go.

28:30.041 --> 28:34.083
Spend too much time with fragmented data
and it'll take over your consciousness.

28:35.375 --> 28:36.375
Holly...

28:37.333 --> 28:38.333
come on.

28:39.041 --> 28:40.208
Who is...

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
You idiots.

28:49.916 --> 28:53.833
How long does it take to kill one kid?

28:57.708 --> 28:58.875
Two days...

29:00.083 --> 29:02.958
Only two days to the succession.

29:05.541 --> 29:07.583
Get it through your head!

29:12.208 --> 29:13.250
You okay?

29:14.083 --> 29:15.416
Tell me, are you?

29:16.833 --> 29:18.041
I'm sorry.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.833
You have to understand,

29:21.791 --> 29:24.875
it hurts to hit you, too.

29:29.375 --> 29:32.000
Those damn bodyguards...

29:33.250 --> 29:36.416
Next time, you're finished!

29:38.291 --> 29:42.083
ONE DAY TO THE SUCCESSION CEREMONY

30:23.541 --> 30:24.791
Just as I thought.

30:25.458 --> 30:27.041
The damn yakuza.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.500
Gena!

30:43.750 --> 30:45.791
Why are all these yakuza here?

30:45.875 --> 30:49.041
One of our security guards,Â Nogaki,
was found dead.

30:49.458 --> 30:51.833
Boss ordered increased security.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
I see.

30:54.166 --> 30:57.000
I'm going to see Genzo.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.416
Will you come with me, Gena?

31:01.875 --> 31:03.333
Fine, then.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.750
What is this, a parade?

31:13.833 --> 31:16.333
No need to get cheeky.

31:29.416 --> 31:30.416
What the...?

31:36.500 --> 31:39.083
Who's there?

31:49.208 --> 31:50.708
Taniguchi!

32:00.375 --> 32:03.166
The fuck did you just do?

32:07.416 --> 32:09.916
What are you standing around for? Get him.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.041
You bastard!

32:23.708 --> 32:24.875
Kill them!

32:27.458 --> 32:28.458
Taste this!

33:05.541 --> 33:07.125
What are they doing here?

33:10.708 --> 33:11.958
That won't work.

33:40.333 --> 33:41.333
Ken!

34:46.166 --> 34:47.666
Come on, follow me.

34:51.083 --> 34:52.083
Miss Holly?

34:52.416 --> 34:53.416
What the...

34:53.708 --> 34:56.083
The fuck? Watch it!

35:15.375 --> 35:17.291
Help us, Ogai!

35:21.250 --> 35:24.666
Property destruction detected.

35:24.750 --> 35:28.458
Calculating amount of damages.

35:30.958 --> 35:34.291
Insurance will not cover
for depreciated...

35:34.375 --> 35:37.458
- Ogai! We're being attacked.
- My, oh my!

35:38.333 --> 35:41.541
Holly is my friend.

36:25.125 --> 36:29.041
It seems I've caused the most destruction.

36:35.125 --> 36:36.416
Kid...

36:37.250 --> 36:39.166
Why are they so desperate to get you?

36:42.500 --> 36:43.500
Well...

36:44.875 --> 36:46.166
that's because...

36:47.458 --> 36:49.666
Tell me everything if you want to live.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.916
I'm not throwing away my life
because you wouldn't talk.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.500
I'm...

36:58.541 --> 37:00.583
going to kill the boss.

37:05.291 --> 37:09.833
<i>To help realize the founding boss' idea
for a succession system,</i>

37:10.166 --> 37:15.875
<i>the tattooist Margot invented a piece
of technology to embed a special program</i>

37:15.958 --> 37:19.375
<i>into the tattoo traditionally worn
by the Mizumoto boss.</i>

37:21.833 --> 37:24.791
<i>By performing the succession ritual,</i>

37:24.875 --> 37:30.750
<i>the program runs, destroying the stack
contained in the previous boss' sleeve.</i>

37:31.416 --> 37:37.250
<i>The tattoo is passed onto the next boss,
and the ritual is repeated.</i>

37:38.958 --> 37:44.000
If Shinji kills you, he'd be able
to avoid real death. In other words...

37:44.083 --> 37:47.291
He stays in power forever.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.541
Is there a backup
of that tattoo technology?

37:53.583 --> 37:55.833
So only you can access it?

38:00.958 --> 38:01.958
What?

38:02.500 --> 38:03.583
Gena...

38:04.291 --> 38:05.958
we should treat your wounds.

38:06.541 --> 38:07.875
Let's go back to the room.

38:09.375 --> 38:11.750
Aren't you going to see Genzo?

38:13.166 --> 38:15.666
Your treatment comes first.

38:22.041 --> 38:23.041
Yes.

38:23.416 --> 38:27.791
According to the data I acquired,
Shinji is definitely behind the coup.

38:28.416 --> 38:29.416
How shall I proceed?

38:29.875 --> 38:31.625
<i>Your mission is accomplished.</i>

38:31.708 --> 38:34.291
<i>We have enough leverage overÂ Mizumoto.</i>

38:34.916 --> 38:38.041
<i>If the coup succeeds,
we can blackmail Shinji.</i>

38:38.125 --> 38:41.875
<i>If it fails, we still have intel
on the boss' tattoo.</i>

38:42.250 --> 38:43.666
<i>It's time for you to withdraw.</i>

38:44.625 --> 38:47.125
<i>Your source, was it Holly Togram?</i>

38:48.333 --> 38:50.958
<i>She needs to be eliminated.</i>

38:51.500 --> 38:52.500
<i>That's all.</i>

38:55.500 --> 38:58.291
CTAC is no better than the yakuza.

39:14.791 --> 39:20.291
<i>He'll chop your off your limbs
And rip off your skin</i>

39:21.000 --> 39:26.916
<i>And sew your pieces onto him</i>

39:27.833 --> 39:32.916
<i>Stay at home, don't go out alone</i>

39:33.750 --> 39:39.833
<i>Or the Patchwork Man will crack your bones</i>

39:43.583 --> 39:49.875
<i>Or the Patchwork Man will crack your bones</i>

39:52.500 --> 39:53.500
Big brother...

39:56.750 --> 39:58.666
What were you singing?

40:00.083 --> 40:02.166
A song my baby sister used to like.

40:03.458 --> 40:04.458
Right...

40:05.958 --> 40:07.375
I'm going into VR.

40:07.666 --> 40:09.666
Watch her while I'm away.

40:12.833 --> 40:13.833
Gena?

40:15.791 --> 40:16.916
Yeah, okay.

40:28.541 --> 40:31.875
Do you believe it, Takeshi?

40:32.333 --> 40:35.375
That their code is real?

40:36.000 --> 40:40.250
That they're willing to tattoo themselves
with a self-destruction device?

40:41.125 --> 40:42.250
Who knows?

40:43.125 --> 40:47.375
I have no insight
into the thoughts of an old geezer.

40:47.458 --> 40:50.125
What does age have to do with it?

40:50.208 --> 40:53.750
We live in an age
where bodies are replaceable.

40:53.833 --> 40:57.458
I could be 2,000 years old,

40:57.541 --> 40:59.500
or I could be 18.

40:59.583 --> 41:03.541
No 18-year-old talks like that, old man.

41:19.375 --> 41:20.458
My brother...

41:22.500 --> 41:24.083
I missed you.

41:25.208 --> 41:27.833
I was the one that rescued you.

41:32.916 --> 41:36.958
Will the men honor the code?

41:37.416 --> 41:38.916
I wonder.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.791
I for one wouldn't trust a guy
with such an obnoxious laugh.

41:44.625 --> 41:45.875
Obnoxious laugh?

41:46.250 --> 41:51.916
Yeah.
Genzo laughs like a strangled chicken.

41:54.208 --> 41:57.083
Anyway, something will happen
at tomorrow's ceremony.

41:58.666 --> 41:59.666
What?

42:15.125 --> 42:16.125
Takeshi,

42:16.666 --> 42:19.875
there's something I'd like you
to investigate before the ceremony.

42:25.250 --> 42:26.250
Welcome back.

42:27.291 --> 42:30.041
So, what were you discussing?

42:31.000 --> 42:35.541
Apparently, there's more to the ritual
than what Holly told us.

42:35.625 --> 42:36.916
I need to look into it.

42:37.375 --> 42:40.875
Shinji will want to kill Holly
before the ceremony begins.

42:41.375 --> 42:44.083
Look after her while I'm gone.

42:50.416 --> 42:53.333
I'm not her babysitter.

42:54.958 --> 42:57.750
Why are you still here?

42:58.708 --> 43:00.333
None of your business.

43:01.166 --> 43:04.666
There's no sign of reinforcements coming
or you leaving.

43:07.375 --> 43:09.291
What's CTAC up to?

43:10.291 --> 43:12.541
I received orders to withdraw earlier.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.083
I see.

43:15.666 --> 43:17.083
You should get out, too.

43:18.791 --> 43:20.791
Didn't think you'd be concerned.

43:22.166 --> 43:25.041
Face those ninjas alone and you'll die.

43:25.791 --> 43:27.250
Your stack will be destroyed.

43:27.625 --> 43:29.083
I can't back out now.

43:30.125 --> 43:31.583
You should run.

43:31.833 --> 43:35.416
What's the point of dying
for someone else's cause?

43:35.958 --> 43:38.333
If I run, I'll be surrounded by enemies.

43:39.583 --> 43:41.000
It's suicidal.

43:41.708 --> 43:45.541
Why are you always putting your life
on the line for other people?

43:46.166 --> 43:47.875
What do you know about me?

43:59.166 --> 44:03.166
<i>To increase security
ahead of tomorrow's ceremony,</i>

44:03.250 --> 44:06.750
<i>we will now conduct a system update.</i>

44:06.833 --> 44:09.875
There isn't much time.
I'm going to check out their HQ.

44:15.583 --> 44:16.583
Ken.

44:16.958 --> 44:18.250
You'll need a security pass.

44:20.708 --> 44:22.041
A souvenir, is it?

44:22.625 --> 44:23.625
See ya.

44:31.750 --> 44:33.625
Holly, wake up.

44:34.916 --> 44:36.375
What's the matter, Gena?

44:37.041 --> 44:38.041
Listen closely.

44:39.666 --> 44:42.208
There's something you need to know.

45:34.625 --> 45:37.041
Bingo, old man.

45:43.416 --> 45:46.666
DAY OF THE SUCCESSION CEREMONY

45:50.375 --> 45:52.166
- Really?
- Ogai.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.666
What's the news?

45:55.291 --> 45:57.250
Mr. Ken and Ms. Gena,

45:57.375 --> 46:01.291
have you seen the flying firework devices
around the building?

46:01.791 --> 46:02.791
Not interested.

46:03.291 --> 46:04.291
What do you want?

46:04.958 --> 46:11.583
I'll be controlling the fireworks display
after the ceremony.

46:11.666 --> 46:14.791
It's my time to shine.

46:14.958 --> 46:17.291
Over here, you two.

46:21.958 --> 46:23.041
What did you do?

46:23.125 --> 46:24.791
I took a picture.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Show us the picture, Ogai.

46:27.416 --> 46:28.416
Certainly.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.125
Enough joking around.

46:31.291 --> 46:32.625
What do you want?

46:33.041 --> 46:38.541
Due to increased security levels,
certain areas are off-limits today.

46:38.625 --> 46:41.458
The communal bath on the tenth floor
and the 11th floor...

46:43.750 --> 46:44.750
What the...?

46:44.875 --> 46:45.875
What was that?

46:45.916 --> 46:47.791
Something must have happened.

46:47.875 --> 46:49.333
I'll go check it out.

46:54.666 --> 46:55.916
Holly's gone.

47:00.541 --> 47:01.875
What was that?

47:03.416 --> 47:05.083
The fireworks have exploded.

47:07.541 --> 47:08.958
Perfect timing.

47:09.333 --> 47:12.333
Use this diversion
to get rid of the bodyguards.

47:13.291 --> 47:16.791
The tattoo won't be finished
until just before the ceremony.

47:16.875 --> 47:18.583
There's still time.

47:18.958 --> 47:19.958
Yes, sir.

47:25.541 --> 47:27.208
Don't screw up this time.

47:34.208 --> 47:35.291
What?

47:36.666 --> 47:38.666
A firework malfunction
caused the explosion.

47:39.041 --> 47:39.999
Boss...

47:40.000 --> 47:42.416
We can't let it interfere
with the ceremony.

47:42.500 --> 47:44.916
We're finishing the tattoo now.

47:50.166 --> 47:51.166
You bastard...

48:05.750 --> 48:06.958
Miss Holly is missing.

48:07.041 --> 48:09.000
Sweep the hotel and headquarters.

48:09.083 --> 48:09.999
Yes, sir.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Wait.

48:11.458 --> 48:14.291
Holly is probably at the ceremony.

48:14.666 --> 48:16.666
Why would you know that?

48:16.750 --> 48:18.500
Ninjas took her, didn't they?

48:18.583 --> 48:19.583
Listen...

48:20.666 --> 48:22.333
I was sent here by Tanaseda.

48:23.916 --> 48:25.875
I'll share everything I know.

48:26.291 --> 48:27.375
We need to join forces.

48:27.750 --> 48:29.166
That can wait.

48:38.625 --> 48:42.833
Damn it. They had to show up today?

48:43.416 --> 48:46.041
Your precious ceremony is a farce, too.

49:55.791 --> 49:57.791
Our current boss Genzo

49:58.166 --> 50:01.125
has faced death in the name of honor.

50:01.791 --> 50:03.916
But this is not the end of him.

50:04.625 --> 50:08.791
Untethered to the body,
his soul shall transform into a dragon,

50:09.208 --> 50:12.083
leading me along the path to glory.

50:18.791 --> 50:21.125
Congratulations on your inauguration,

50:21.208 --> 50:24.958
Mr. Shinji, or shall I say Mr. Genzo?

50:25.041 --> 50:29.000
Or did you go by yet another name
before that?

50:29.416 --> 50:30.416
Who are you?

50:31.750 --> 50:33.375
How did you gain access?

50:33.875 --> 50:37.666
How many times have you ascended
to boss now?

50:38.500 --> 50:39.791
Father...

50:40.416 --> 50:41.625
Hideki!

50:42.333 --> 50:46.291
It's just like you to come up
with a hairbrained plot like this.

50:46.375 --> 50:48.375
Ogai, what's going on?

50:48.458 --> 50:50.500
I'm working on it.

50:51.166 --> 50:53.875
By having the boss give up their life,

50:54.375 --> 50:57.875
you ensured absolute loyalty
from your men.

51:01.541 --> 51:06.666
<i>But in reality, you've been taking over
the new boss' sleeve.</i>

51:39.166 --> 51:45.541
<i>You robbed them of all the hard work
they put into the syndicate.</i>

51:47.500 --> 51:49.000
How despicable...

51:50.000 --> 51:53.083
and utterly shameless you are.

51:53.166 --> 51:54.625
Shut off the audience.

51:54.708 --> 51:55.708
In other words...

51:56.208 --> 52:01.250
<i>the boss of the Mizumoto syndicate
has always been...</i>

52:01.333 --> 52:04.416
you and only you, Father.

52:04.583 --> 52:05.583
Ogai,

52:05.916 --> 52:06.958
shut it off, now!

52:10.583 --> 52:11.583
Father...

52:12.833 --> 52:15.541
did you kill my brother, too?

52:22.791 --> 52:25.208
I've closed down the system.

52:25.916 --> 52:29.208
Holly. Hurry up and finish my tattoo.

52:29.625 --> 52:31.916
All I need is to complete the ritual.

53:07.458 --> 53:09.666
Why is it red?

53:10.375 --> 53:12.833
It should be blue for inaugurations.

53:13.916 --> 53:19.416
Did you just try to activate
a stack destruction program?

53:20.958 --> 53:22.666
You want me dead?

53:28.916 --> 53:30.125
I've had enough.

53:30.916 --> 53:34.416
I'm sick of all the lying, the killing.

53:34.500 --> 53:35.583
Shut up!

53:36.541 --> 53:39.666
Hurry up.
Finish the tattoo and complete the ritual.

53:40.375 --> 53:44.666
Then give me back my parents' stacks.

53:46.541 --> 53:48.083
What are you talking about?

53:48.750 --> 53:50.791
Gena found the records.

53:51.791 --> 53:57.833
I know my parents' stacks were purchased
by the Mizumoto syndicate a long time ago.

54:00.708 --> 54:02.333
So it's true?

54:04.666 --> 54:08.166
Give me back my mom and dad!

54:19.875 --> 54:20.958
There.

54:24.958 --> 54:26.500
Dad... Mom?

54:27.000 --> 54:28.083
You fool.

54:32.208 --> 54:34.708
No!

54:38.250 --> 54:40.583
You traitor!

54:47.500 --> 54:48.625
What's this?

54:50.083 --> 54:51.333
Don't worry.

54:52.041 --> 54:53.958
They know who you are.

54:54.791 --> 54:56.375
You've got to be kidding me.

54:57.166 --> 55:01.875
How many...
How many men gave their lives for you?

55:01.958 --> 55:03.625
What about the code of honor?

55:03.708 --> 55:05.083
Honor?

55:09.791 --> 55:12.750
None of you were interested in honor.

55:13.583 --> 55:17.916
You just wanted a cause
to blindly fight and die for.

55:18.416 --> 55:20.875
Must be nice to live in ignorance.

55:21.208 --> 55:27.000
You have no idea the sacrifices I've made
to build up the Mizumoto syndicate.

55:27.083 --> 55:30.916
You kill boss after boss
and yet you speak of sacrifice?

55:31.416 --> 55:36.166
I gave their worthless existences meaning.

55:36.458 --> 55:42.458
You all, too.
You just wanted a stage to dance on.

55:43.666 --> 55:45.166
You ought to be grateful.

55:45.958 --> 55:50.416
Me. My very soul...

55:51.291 --> 55:53.750
is the essence of the Mizumoto syndicate.

55:56.333 --> 55:59.000
An actor who doesn't know his time is up

56:00.500 --> 56:03.041
will have to be dragged off stage.

56:18.750 --> 56:19.708
After him!

56:19.709 --> 56:20.833
Get him!

56:27.250 --> 56:28.958
Where is he hiding?

56:29.041 --> 56:30.250
That piece of scum...

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
What's this?

56:40.416 --> 56:41.541
What's going on?

56:52.750 --> 56:53.750
Get away!

56:58.000 --> 56:59.666
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

57:00.125 --> 57:03.083
I can't stand yakuza who use children.

57:29.750 --> 57:32.500
I can rebuild the syndicate
whenever I want.

57:34.041 --> 57:36.333
All I need is for you to die.

57:43.750 --> 57:45.000
Get behind me, Holly.

57:53.916 --> 57:54.916
Die!

57:55.916 --> 57:56.916
Gena!

58:44.375 --> 58:45.541
You bastard!

59:04.125 --> 59:07.916
Ogai! You have to defeat him.

59:08.541 --> 59:11.083
Please help us, Ogai!

59:11.416 --> 59:13.791
My master is...

59:14.333 --> 59:17.333
the new boss, Shinji.

59:17.416 --> 59:19.041
Ogai...

59:20.833 --> 59:21.916
Please.

59:25.125 --> 59:29.458
What a tearjerker. Poor little Holly.

59:29.541 --> 59:33.833
Mom and Dad dead. No more friends either.

59:42.416 --> 59:45.833
I see your horrid laugh hasn't changed...

59:55.916 --> 59:56.916
Father.

59:57.166 --> 59:58.250
Hideki!

59:59.125 --> 01:00:01.916
You were here on Latimer?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.416
They say you should be there
for a parent's death.

01:00:05.791 --> 01:00:07.291
You...

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:13.041
Mr. Ogai. I believe I sent some data
to your customer service station.

01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:14.666
Did you see it?

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:18.291
Allow me to check. One moment, please.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:23.083
What are you up to, Hideki?

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:28.500
Ken found consciousness transmission
records for each of the past bosses.

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:29.583
What...

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:35.916
That body is Shinji's,

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:38.875
but the stack belongs to the founder.

01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:40.291
So what?

01:00:41.166 --> 01:00:42.875
I'm the boss.

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:45.291
In the past...

01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:47.666
and until the end of time.

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.250
The current boss is Shinji.

01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:53.250
You are not the boss.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Holly is my friend.

01:00:57.291 --> 01:00:58.416
Ogai!

01:00:58.625 --> 01:01:00.875
Please wait three seconds.

01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:10.166
Ogai!

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:14.708
My brother!

01:02:17.291 --> 01:02:18.750
My brother...

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:33.291
<i>Big brother...</i>

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.041
Big brother.

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:46.666
Show us your true self, you coward.

01:02:54.125 --> 01:02:56.958
I don't know about tradition or honor...

01:02:57.833 --> 01:03:01.083
but all I see is a man hiding
in someone else's sleeve.

01:03:06.791 --> 01:03:08.625
You maggot.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:12.083
Bring it on.

01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:21.333
You god damn piece of shit!

01:04:22.416 --> 01:04:25.291
You little punk!

01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:07.666
Father.

01:05:07.875 --> 01:05:10.125
We haven't completed the ritual yet.

01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:15.208
Holly...

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.916
Die, you devil!

01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:37.375
You only die once.

01:05:38.166 --> 01:05:39.708
Make sure you remember it.

01:05:43.666 --> 01:05:46.541
I don't want to die...

01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:49.583
I don't want to die...

01:05:57.916 --> 01:05:59.000
Hideki.

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:00.625
I don't want to die.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:05.458
Help me, Hideki.

01:06:07.666 --> 01:06:09.750
Do it for your father.

01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:11.666
I still want to live...

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.125
My last act of filial piety.

01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:33.750
MIZUMOTO

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.458
"I got rid of Holly."

01:06:46.625 --> 01:06:48.791
That's what I told CTAC.

01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:51.541
Gena!

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:54.625
Now you can needlecast anywhere.

01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:55.791
Yes.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.041
Are you sure you don't want this picture?

01:07:00.708 --> 01:07:01.791
Delete it.

01:07:02.541 --> 01:07:03.541
I don't want it.

01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:05.791
As you wish.

01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:10.916
By the way, Mr. Ken,
Mr. Tanaseda is waiting for you upstairs.

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:12.958
Got it.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.958
All right... Guess I'll head off.

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:34.416
Goodbye...

01:07:35.625 --> 01:07:36.750
my brother.

01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:43.500
So, Margot...

01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:46.750
You're starting to grow tall.

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:51.333
Would you like to switch to a new sleeve
like always?

01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:55.541
I'm thinking of growing old
in this sleeve.

01:07:56.416 --> 01:08:02.458
I want Ken and Gena to recognize me
when I reunite with them as an adult.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:04.250
Okay.

01:08:12.583 --> 01:08:16.125
Have you talked to the yakuza
on Harlan's World?

01:08:16.457 --> 01:08:17.541
Talked to them?

01:08:18.375 --> 01:08:19.625
Not yet.

01:08:20.791 --> 01:08:22.416
We had a deal.

01:08:23.582 --> 01:08:25.666
I have another mission for you.

01:08:28.166 --> 01:08:32.082
You said if I did the job,
you'd mediate with the yakuza.

01:08:32.166 --> 01:08:35.082
I never said it was just one job.

01:08:36.916 --> 01:08:38.375
You've got to be kidding me.

01:08:40.707 --> 01:08:42.541
Are you ready?

01:08:46.541 --> 01:08:47.957
Mr. Tanaseda...

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:53.625
you might be more like your father
than you think.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.416
Where's the next job?

01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:16.708
