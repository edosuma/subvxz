WEBVTT

00:12.346 --> 00:15.053
( crow cawing )

00:15.224 --> 00:17.306
What the hell
is this mess?

00:17.476 --> 00:19.467
She did this.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.226
It means something,

00:21.397 --> 00:23.513
the way it's all
set up like that.

00:24.901 --> 00:27.358
The Governor was right
to send us out.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.143
Damn straight, Tim.

00:29.322 --> 00:32.906
We're doing a righteous
public service here.

00:33.075 --> 00:35.066
Go back.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.745
What?

00:38.873 --> 00:40.454
Neil:
The arms are a G.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.365
The legs make an O.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.283
And that's a back.
It says, "Go back."

00:47.215 --> 00:49.046
(laughing)

00:49.217 --> 00:50.707
This is too good.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.251
Look at this.

00:53.429 --> 00:55.715
She sent us
a biter-gram, y'all.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.221
( laughs)

00:57.391 --> 01:00.224
I don't believe
this is happening.

01:01.604 --> 01:05.267
Hey, hey!
You knock it off.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.807
What the hell's
wrong with you?

01:07.985 --> 01:10.021
Now, the Governor
chose you

01:10.196 --> 01:12.528
'cause he thought
you were ready.

01:12.698 --> 01:15.405
I want you to succeed.
I do.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.862
But if you keep
announcing to the world

01:18.037 --> 01:19.743
that you're pissing
your pants,

01:19.914 --> 01:22.280
I'm gonna have to
smash your teeth in.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.835
Now how do you say
your last name?

01:29.006 --> 01:30.507
Gargulio.

01:31.968 --> 01:34.926
Well, I'm gonna keep
calling you Neil.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.838
All right?

01:38.015 --> 01:40.097
( rustling )

01:43.604 --> 01:46.596
What's the deal,
Michonne? Hmm?

01:46.774 --> 01:50.016
You gonna leap out of the woods,
one against four,

01:50.194 --> 01:51.730
all of us armed
to the teeth

01:51.904 --> 01:55.237
and you with just
your little pig-sticker?

01:55.408 --> 01:57.569
No, no, no, Michonne.

02:08.087 --> 02:09.577
( growls )

02:26.272 --> 02:28.433
We having fun yet?!

02:28.607 --> 02:30.598
(theme music playing )

03:06.729 --> 03:09.345
Woman on phone: Hello?
ls-- is someone there?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.684
Rick: Yes. Yes.
Who is--?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.190
Woman:
Oh, my God!

03:13.361 --> 03:14.817
I can't believe
someone picked up.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.694
We've been calling since--
since it all started.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.196
Rick:
Where are you?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.028
Woman:
I can't say.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.158
Rick: You could be
1,000 miles away.

03:23.329 --> 03:25.490
Woman: I'm not going to say
where we are.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.495
Rick:
Are you--

03:27.666 --> 03:29.748
are you someplace safe?

03:29.919 --> 03:31.534
Woman:
Yeah.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.545
And part of it
is because we're careful.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.501
I can't tell you
where we are.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.085
I'm sorry.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.388
What ma-- what makes
your place so safe?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.386
It's just...

03:43.557 --> 03:45.422
away...

03:45.601 --> 03:47.557
from them.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.223
l have a son.

03:58.447 --> 04:02.406
|-- l have a newborn baby.

04:03.828 --> 04:05.534
I'm with a good group
of people.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.410
Would you be willing--

04:09.125 --> 04:11.457
could you take in others?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.911
We can pull our weight.
We can help you.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.750
I'd have to talk
to the group.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.664
Well, put them on.
Let me make a case.

04:18.843 --> 04:20.174
Let me talk to them first.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.754
Please, please,
don't-- don't go.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.763
Just-- please,
we're good people here.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.549
We just need some help
and we can help you.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.888
- I'll call back in two hours.
- Please!

04:31.063 --> 04:33.520
You don't understand.
You don't know.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.188
We're dying.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.772
- We're dying here.
- ( clicks )

04:58.299 --> 05:00.506
Rick:
Everybody okay?

05:00.676 --> 05:02.667
Yeah, we are.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.436
What about you?

05:11.604 --> 05:14.141
I cleared out
the boiler block.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.601
How many were there?

05:16.775 --> 05:19.482
I don't know.
A dozen, two dozen.

05:19.653 --> 05:23.362
l have to get back.
Just wanted to check on Carl.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.488
Rick, we can handle
taking out the bodies.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.820
- You don't have to.
- No, I do.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.619
Everyone have a gun
and a knife?

05:31.790 --> 05:34.702
Yeah. We're running
low on ammo, though.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.084
Maggie and me were planning
on making a run this afternoon.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.165
Found a phone book
with some places we can hit,

05:39.340 --> 05:40.705
look for bullets and formula.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.498
We cleared out
the generator room.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.507
Axel's there trying to fix it

05:44.678 --> 05:46.214
in case of emergency.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.640
We're gonna sweep
the lower levels as well.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.184
Good. Good.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.343
Rick.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.189
(whimpering)

05:59.360 --> 06:02.443
Let's go. She's hit.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.444
Slowed her down.

06:04.615 --> 06:07.778
- Tim and Crowley, they--
- We're close to the red zone.

06:07.952 --> 06:10.739
Them shots just pulled
every biter in this area our way.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.575
- Let's go. Get up.
-( hyperventilating )

06:13.749 --> 06:15.580
Neil!

06:15.751 --> 06:17.082
(grunts)

06:17.253 --> 06:19.289
Now you're gonna rise
to the occasion, son.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.328
Some serious shit's
going down.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.543
I need you here.
You read me, amigo?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.504
- I don't want you to die.
- Yes. Yes.

06:26.679 --> 06:28.590
Get up.

06:28.764 --> 06:33.007
Now you know we don't ever
let our own turn.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.641
Neven

06:38.691 --> 06:40.898
Come on.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.524
Just do it.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.692
Atta boy.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.697
Come on,
let's get going.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.484
She ain't running,
she's hunting.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.575
So are we.
There we go.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.786
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,
catch a biter by the toe.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.292
My mother said to pick...

07:00.462 --> 07:02.202
Governor:
You know you can join in.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.417
They don't bite.

07:04.592 --> 07:08.801
That's kind of the whole idea
of the place.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.427
Seems like you also
encourage people

07:10.598 --> 07:12.930
to punch each other
in the face.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.091
The arena.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.975
You didn't like
that much, huh?

07:17.146 --> 07:21.105
No, not so much,
but I get it.

07:21.275 --> 07:24.108
Listen, I want to
ask you something.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.064
No.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.354
Okay.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.114
Hold on.
How do you get it?

07:31.285 --> 07:33.071
I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your town.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.576
This is our town.
You stayed.

07:34.747 --> 07:37.113
You're part of this now,
so tell me.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.077
(sighs)

07:42.087 --> 07:45.454
If it's an escape,
I don't think it's the right one.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.123
It's brutality for fun,

07:47.301 --> 07:50.885
and I think the world's
brutal enough already.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.048
It really
bothered you, huh?

07:55.225 --> 07:57.056
But I do want to be here.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.683
So what were you saying

07:58.854 --> 08:01.641
before I made you condemn
our sadistic way of life?

08:01.815 --> 08:05.057
I want to contribute.
Everyone else does.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.736
Well, Robbie could use
some help in food distr--

08:06.904 --> 08:08.144
I want to work the wall.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.654
I'm a good shot.
I want to stay that way.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.200
Can you use a bow?

08:12.368 --> 08:13.824
I can learn.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.110
Well, I can get
somebody to teach you.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.418
(sighs)

08:31.595 --> 08:34.337
-( phone rings)
- Hello?

08:34.515 --> 08:36.051
Hello?

08:36.225 --> 08:38.341
Man: You the guy
she was talking to?

08:40.979 --> 08:42.844
Yes.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.763
And you want to come
where we are?

08:44.942 --> 08:48.184
- She said it was safe.
- It is.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.854
No attacks,
no one's been bit,

08:52.032 --> 08:54.614
no one's died,

08:54.785 --> 08:57.697
no one's turned,
no one's gone crazy.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.951
Yes, we want to come
where you are.

09:02.126 --> 09:04.492
You could be dangerous.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.661
Have you killed anyone?

09:11.218 --> 09:14.927
Yes, people who threatened me
or threatened my group.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.719
How many people
have you killed?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.762
Foun

09:26.567 --> 09:28.398
Two outsiders who tried
to draw on me.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.059
One threw me to walkers.

09:30.237 --> 09:34.071
The other one,
he was one of our own.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.197
He lost it.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.199
Lost what?

09:38.370 --> 09:40.531
Who he was.

09:40.706 --> 09:43.413
He threatened me.

09:43.584 --> 09:47.247
He tried to kill me,
so I killed him.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.503
How did you lose
your wife?

09:50.758 --> 09:52.589
How do you know
I had a wife?

09:52.760 --> 09:56.298
You have a boy
and a baby.

09:56.472 --> 09:58.758
Tell me how you lost
your wife.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.524
I don't want to talk
about that.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.108
- ( clicks )
- Hello?

10:16.283 --> 10:19.116
Hello?
No!

10:20.871 --> 10:22.862
No!

10:33.592 --> 10:34.923
Andrea:
Thanks for doing this.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.129
When the Gov asks me
to do something, I do it.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.635
I figure we can
start tomorrow.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.842
There's a training area,
some hay bales.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.472
There's even a bow
you can use.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.974
It was my old one.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.385
You must be pretty good.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.148
Yeah.
My dad taught me.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.649
He used to
take me hunting.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.356
He wanted me to be
in the Olympics.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.145
This one was his.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.234
I mean, it's worth
more than my car.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.900
It's... awesome.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.491
So I totally
killed him for it.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.159
That wasn't why
you killed him.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.373
No.

11:12.548 --> 11:15.381
My dad wasn't himself.
My brother wasn't either.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.257
I had to kill my sister.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.176
Sucks, right?

11:28.480 --> 11:29.981
Yeah.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.857
- ( growling )
- Walker.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.980
Cool.
Watch this.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.213
- I got it.
- I can do it.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.884
We're not supposed
to go over the wall.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.597
(grunts)

12:13.025 --> 12:14.731
What the hell was that?

12:14.902 --> 12:17.314
That is how it's done.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.068
I said I could do it.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.025
What is wrong with you?

12:21.199 --> 12:23.190
This isn't a game.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.530
( clanking )

12:30.918 --> 12:32.909
( door closes)

12:52.648 --> 12:54.138
May I?

13:18.048 --> 13:20.039
Still feel it.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.676
I'm wiggling
my toes right now.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.303
( chuckles )

13:27.474 --> 13:29.681
I'm a ghost
from the knee down.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.888
I'm sorry.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.645
You saved my life, Rick.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.608
She was sorry for
the things that happened.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.860
She told me that.

13:50.038 --> 13:53.405
She planned
on telling you.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.950
Take your time,
whatever you need.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.869
You carried us.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.208
You didn't let us give up.
You got us here.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.624
It's not enough.
It's not safe enough.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.464
There isn't anywhere else.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.471
I know you want
to get away from this,

14:09.641 --> 14:12.098
but we've run already.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.521
I got a call.

14:17.691 --> 14:18.851
What?

14:19.026 --> 14:20.687
Someone called.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.944
On this phone.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.945
A woman.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.357
She was young.
She was part of a group.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.698
She said they had
a safe place.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.873
They said they were just dialing
numbers and I picked up.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.044
She said they'd
be calling back.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.551
If it sounds right, I want to talk
them into taking us in.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.054
Did she say
where they were?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.340
No, but it doesn't matter.

14:53.518 --> 14:57.102
If it's safe, we'll get there.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.888
Don't tell the rest
of the group, not yet.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.571
l'll sit here with you.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.700
That's something
I'm pretty good at nowadays.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.531
No.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.415
All right.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.562
( rustling )

15:48.740 --> 15:50.276
Move!

15:53.954 --> 15:56.286
( groans )

15:57.624 --> 15:59.239
( groans )

15:59.417 --> 16:02.124
- Ah!
- ( Michonne coughing)

16:06.967 --> 16:09.174
(growling)

16:18.937 --> 16:22.270
(coughing)

16:24.484 --> 16:26.975
( groans )

16:29.948 --> 16:31.563
( squelches )

16:49.718 --> 16:52.835
( metal clanking )

16:55.307 --> 16:57.298
Check it out, man.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.466
Must have missed it
last night.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.100
It's probably just
one or two of 'em.

17:04.274 --> 17:06.481
Don't look
they got much fight.

17:12.908 --> 17:14.694
They ain't going nowhere.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.154
We'll take care of it
on the way back.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.908
( whistles )

17:21.082 --> 17:23.038
Come on.

17:27.047 --> 17:30.915
You know, my mom,
she liked her wine.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.256
She liked to
smoke in bed.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.762
Virginia Slims.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.719
l was playing out with the kids
in the neighborhood.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.681
I could do that
with Merle gone.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.277
They had bikes, I didn't.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.274
We heard sirens
getting louder.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.537
They jumped on their bikes,
ran after it,

18:02.707 --> 18:05.824
you know, hoping to see
something worth seeing.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.168
I ran after them,
but I couldn't keep up.

18:14.511 --> 18:17.173
I ran around a corner

18:17.347 --> 18:20.885
and saw my friends
looking at me.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.391
Hell, I saw everybody
looking at me.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.808
Fire trucks everywhere.

18:27.983 --> 18:31.100
People from
the neighborhood.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.645
It was my house
they were there for.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.986
It was my mom in bed

18:38.159 --> 18:40.286
burnt down to nothing.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.704
That was the hard part.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.367
You know,
she was just gone.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.127
Erased.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.630
Nothing left of her.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.302
People said it was
better that way.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.464
( chuckles)
I don't know.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.304
Just made it seem
like it wasn't real, you know?

19:08.982 --> 19:10.938
I shot my mom.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.481
She was out.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.646
Hadn't turned yet.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.030
lendedit

19:23.204 --> 19:25.195
It was real.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.332
Sorry about your mom.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.123
I'm sorry about yours.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.503
Come on.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.471
( knocks )

19:49.981 --> 19:52.017
Come in.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.238
I know why
you want to see me.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.947
You were told we don't
go over unless we have to.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.282
ljust...

20:07.457 --> 20:09.698
I wanted
a little practice.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.377
Fair enough.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.374
We don't need you
on the wall.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.591
Okay.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.639
I liked the fights.

20:31.022 --> 20:36.233
I didn't like
that I liked them.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.769
But you did.
I know.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.781
What?

20:43.952 --> 20:45.237
How?

20:45.412 --> 20:49.200
Could have walked out.
You started walking out.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.208
But you stayed.

20:54.379 --> 20:57.086
Just like you stayed
right now to tell me that.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.623
( chuckles )

20:59.801 --> 21:02.793
Are you saying
that I like you, too?

21:02.971 --> 21:06.088
I think
I'm growing on you.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.851
You rose
to the occasion, kid.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.728
When we get back,
I'm gonna get you a beer.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.435
Come on, she can't have
made it that far.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.770
No, no, no, no.
We're done.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.277
We're gonna grab a car,
haul ass home.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.779
It's been
a good day's work.

21:22.949 --> 21:26.066
But she-- she killed
Tim and Crowley.

21:26.244 --> 21:29.828
Yep, but we messed
her up pretty bad.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.831
Anyway, she's headed
straight for the red zone.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.788
She's as good as dead.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.463
What do we tell
the Governor?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.086
What the hell you think
we tell him?

21:39.257 --> 21:40.497
Tell him we killed her.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.540
Like I said, man,
she's as good as dead.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.301
I'm gonna keep going.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.554
She ain't right
in the head.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.430
She's gonna die.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.216
Ain't worth our time.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.180
Definitely ain't
worth our blood.

21:53.354 --> 21:54.855
Now let's go.

21:55.023 --> 21:57.810
This is some serious shit.
That's what you said.

22:00.069 --> 22:03.106
I'm not gonna lie
to the Governor about it.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.115
You're right.

22:08.286 --> 22:10.277
Can't cut corners
on this one.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.744
You've come along
pretty quick there, kid.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.505
How do you say
your name again?

22:19.672 --> 22:21.833
Gargulio.

22:23.801 --> 22:27.134
- Gargulio.
-( bird squawks)

22:27.305 --> 22:29.045
Hear that bird?

22:29.224 --> 22:31.135
(gunshot)

22:38.441 --> 22:40.022
Gargulio.

22:49.619 --> 22:52.861
(walkers growling )

23:14.435 --> 23:16.300
( phone rings)

23:16.479 --> 23:18.015
Hello?

23:18.189 --> 23:21.522
Woman: You didn't want to tell
him how your wife died?

23:21.693 --> 23:24.526
No, ljust lost her.
But if that's what it takes--

23:24.696 --> 23:26.402
Woman:
It'd be good.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.188
You should talk
about it, Rick.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.072
That sounds--

23:32.662 --> 23:34.368
how--

23:38.501 --> 23:40.913
how do you know my name?

23:42.797 --> 23:44.412
( clicks )

24:17.457 --> 24:20.790
(car approaching )

24:47.320 --> 24:48.810
Clear outside.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.400
All right,
let's take a look.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.656
Hey.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.825
It's a beautiful day.

25:26.943 --> 25:30.652
- ( wings flapping )
- ( gasps )

25:38.079 --> 25:39.740
Glenn, get that duck.

25:39.914 --> 25:42.030
- What?
- Get that duck.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.449
-( laughs ) Are you serious?
- Yeah.

25:44.627 --> 25:47.414
A kid growing up in a prison
could use some toys.

25:49.632 --> 25:52.965
You were the kind of guy who waxed
his car every weekend, right?

25:53.136 --> 25:56.344
No, I wasn't particularly
proud of my car

25:56.514 --> 26:01.099
or my house or my job.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.851
My dog was a wonder
of stupidity.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.307
Lost a fight
with a tree once.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.899
You did this.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.061
| find it hard to believe that you
didn't have a single thing

26:13.239 --> 26:15.571
that you were
proud of before.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.609
I didn't say that.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.412
I had something.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.333
So how long has it been?

26:33.384 --> 26:35.295
Uh, since--

26:35.470 --> 26:37.882
since you had
whiskey this good?

26:39.599 --> 26:42.090
Solong,
I can't remember.

26:42.268 --> 26:45.351
Well, I'm happy
to forget a lot.

26:45.521 --> 26:48.388
Notjust the bad stuff.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.557
Even the good times?

26:50.735 --> 26:54.444
I want to be here

26:54.614 --> 26:56.445
right now.

26:57.784 --> 27:01.493
This glass in my hand,
leaves in the breeze,

27:01.662 --> 27:03.448
talking to you.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.363
| feel special.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.122
An audience
with the Governor.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.829
Ugh.

27:09.003 --> 27:10.994
Let'sjust go with Philip, huh?
I'm off the clock.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.003
Oh, Philip.
That's better.

27:13.174 --> 27:15.756
Makes me feel less
like a lobbyist.

27:17.011 --> 27:20.469
You don't have to be ashamed
about liking the fight.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.551
Or fighting the fight.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.479
I love it.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.309
It's not the only thing,
but nowadays,

27:31.484 --> 27:34.897
it's part of being alive.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.653
Really alive.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.360
Most people don't have it,

27:39.534 --> 27:41.775
what it takes to see
the whole story.

27:41.953 --> 27:44.319
Being able to live
with it, to use it.

27:44.497 --> 27:48.285
That's why there's a hell of a lot
more of them than us.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.324
Us?

27:52.004 --> 27:54.165
Yeah.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.425
'Cause you have it, Andrea.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.507
You made it.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.428
So enjoy it.

28:06.602 --> 28:10.015
Eat, drink, and be merry,
for tomorrow we die.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.599
Oh, I'm not
planning on dying.

28:11.774 --> 28:14.607
No, neither am I.
It just happens.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.528
Other things happen.

28:45.349 --> 28:48.056
Glenn: We just hit the powdered
formula jackpot.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.388
Maggie:
Oh, thank God.

28:50.563 --> 28:53.930
I also got beans, batteries,

28:54.108 --> 28:56.190
cocktail wieners,
many mustards.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.737
It's a straight shot back
to the prison from here.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.816
Probably make it
in time for dinner.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.106
I like the quiet.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.570
Back there, back home,
you can always hear them

29:05.745 --> 29:07.736
outside the fence
no matter where you are.

29:09.540 --> 29:12.407
And where is it y'all good people
are calling home?

29:16.422 --> 29:17.753
Merle?

29:17.924 --> 29:20.916
( laughs)

29:21.093 --> 29:24.051
Wow!

29:25.640 --> 29:27.176
Hey, back the hell up!

29:27.350 --> 29:29.261
Okay, okay, honey.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.766
Jesus.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.098
You made it.

29:35.566 --> 29:39.605
Can you tell me,
is my brother alive?

29:39.779 --> 29:41.269
- Huh?
-Yeah.

29:44.283 --> 29:48.572
Hey, you take me to him
and I'll call it even

29:48.746 --> 29:50.953
on everything that happened
up there in Atlanta.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.115
No hard feelings.
Huh?

29:57.546 --> 30:00.128
( laughs )
You like that?

30:00.299 --> 30:01.835
Yeah.

30:02.009 --> 30:07.254
Well, I found myself
a medical supply warehouse.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.137
Fixed it up myself.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.300
( laughs)
Pretty cool, huh?

30:12.478 --> 30:15.140
We'll tell Daryl you're here
and he'll come out to meet you.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.851
- Hold on. Just hold up.
- Whoa. Whoa.

30:18.025 --> 30:20.107
Hold up here.
Hold up.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.815
Hey, the fact that we found
each other is a miracle.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.197
Come on, now.

30:26.367 --> 30:29.234
You can trust me.

30:29.412 --> 30:30.948
You trust us.

30:31.122 --> 30:33.829
You stay here.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.331
( chuckles )

30:41.173 --> 30:42.709
No!

30:45.928 --> 30:48.135
Hey, hey, hold up,
buddy, hold up.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.011
Let go of her.
Let go of her!

30:50.182 --> 30:51.843
Merle: Put that gun
in the car right now.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.633
Put it in the car, son.

30:56.147 --> 30:59.184
There you go. Now we're gonna
go for a little drive.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.064
We're not going
back to our camp.

31:01.235 --> 31:02.941
No, we're going
somewhere else.

31:03.112 --> 31:06.195
Get in the car, Glenn!
You're driving!

31:06.365 --> 31:08.526
- Move!
- Don't.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.191
Okay.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.360
Merle: Get up.

31:13.748 --> 31:15.238
That's it.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.246
(engine starts)

31:44.028 --> 31:46.144
Oh, that's what
I'm talking about.

31:48.532 --> 31:51.023
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

31:51.202 --> 31:53.739
Yeah, buddy.

31:53.913 --> 31:56.199
What the hell
you need slippers for?

31:56.373 --> 31:59.456
You know,
end of the day, relaxing.

32:01.754 --> 32:04.871
(walker growling )

32:09.095 --> 32:10.881
( exhales )

32:11.055 --> 32:13.046
All right.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.261
Must have been in
the cell at the end.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.478
We checked
everywhere else.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.652
That's Carol's knife.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.671
(ringing)

33:04.150 --> 33:06.357
How did you know
my name?

33:08.154 --> 33:11.317
Woman:
Because we know you.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.321
How do you know me?

33:13.492 --> 33:16.325
And you know them, Rick.

33:17.872 --> 33:19.487
The people you were
talking to today,

33:19.665 --> 33:21.656
that was Amy,
Jim, Jacqui.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.325
Lori?

33:35.890 --> 33:37.505
Lori?

33:37.683 --> 33:40.595
Lori? Lori?

33:40.769 --> 33:42.509
(crying)

33:42.688 --> 33:44.974
What happened, Rick?

33:46.734 --> 33:48.850
Baby, what happened?

33:52.531 --> 33:54.362
I loved you.

33:56.827 --> 33:58.818
I loved you.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.665
I couldn't put it
back together.

34:05.836 --> 34:09.203
I couldn't
put it back together.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.372
I thought it was...
(sobbing )

34:19.099 --> 34:21.841
I made a deal
with myself.

34:24.939 --> 34:27.396
I would keep you alive.

34:30.444 --> 34:33.026
I'd find a place.
I would fix that.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.983
And then...

34:36.951 --> 34:39.943
I couldn't open that door.
I couldn't risk it.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.745
l was gonna
keep you alive.

34:43.916 --> 34:47.750
Carl, the baby.
And then...

34:49.588 --> 34:52.580
I thought
there'd be time.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.623
There's never time.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.757
But I loved you.

34:59.932 --> 35:02.264
I love you.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.015
I couldn't put it
back together.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.266
I should have said it.

35:11.443 --> 35:15.652
lshould-- I should
have said it.

35:15.823 --> 35:17.654
(breaking up)
Rick.

35:17.825 --> 35:20.942
Now you listen to me.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.907
You have a baby.

35:24.081 --> 35:25.787
Our baby.

35:27.418 --> 35:29.500
And Carl.

35:29.670 --> 35:32.753
And the others.

35:32.923 --> 35:35.460
I love you.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.420
Rick.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.585
(voice garbled )

35:40.848 --> 35:43.305
Can you do that?

35:43.475 --> 35:45.386
Can you do that?

35:47.229 --> 35:50.813
Rick? Rick?

35:50.983 --> 35:52.814
Rick?

35:54.987 --> 35:58.320
Rick? Rick?

36:27.936 --> 36:30.678
( knocking )

36:33.817 --> 36:35.853
I lied when I said
I was off the clock.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.861
This is a 24/7 kind of gig.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.989
Should I hide
under the bed?

36:42.159 --> 36:44.195
Not this time.

37:01.512 --> 37:03.002
Company?

37:07.851 --> 37:09.716
Yeah.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.227
- We lost all three guys.
- ( sighs )

37:12.398 --> 37:16.107
Tim, Crowley,
the other one.

37:16.276 --> 37:18.892
Gargulio.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.902
Jesus.

37:21.073 --> 37:24.065
Yeah, she cut Tim down,
put her sword through him.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.985
Then biters got
in the middle of it,

37:27.162 --> 37:29.869
then I got her.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.656
Damn.

37:32.835 --> 37:36.077
Well, we'll dress it up.
Give 'em a hero's funeral.

37:36.255 --> 37:39.622
You tell a story.
A supply run gone sideways.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.586
Do you have 'em?

37:44.513 --> 37:47.380
Her head.
The sword.

37:47.558 --> 37:52.348
Um, we got caught
in a crowd.

37:52.521 --> 37:55.433
The kid had the head,
Crowley had the sword.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.690
They both got all tore up.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.440
I got something else
for you, though.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.775
A guy I used to know
from the Atlanta camp

38:04.950 --> 38:07.111
and his pretty
little girlfriend.

38:09.121 --> 38:11.783
- They know Andrea?
- Mm-hmm.

38:14.543 --> 38:16.659
Anyone else?

38:16.837 --> 38:18.668
Don't know.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.875
Found them on
the return trip.

38:21.049 --> 38:24.041
From the looks of 'em,
they got to be set up pretty good.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.462
I'll find out where.

38:38.025 --> 38:40.016
Everything okay?

38:41.987 --> 38:43.852
Hell, yeah.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.364
( baby fussing )

39:44.508 --> 39:46.464
Hey.

39:46.635 --> 39:48.546
Hey.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.947
(door clanking )

40:33.724 --> 40:37.216
( breathing heavily )

41:18.143 --> 41:20.099
( chuckles )

41:21.438 --> 41:23.474
She looks like you.

41:28.862 --> 41:31.649
Hey, just-- you got her?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.779
- Yeah.
- All right.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.032
Okay.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.323
(fence rattling )

41:53.553 --> 41:56.511
(fence rattling )

41:56.682 --> 41:59.765
(walkers growling )

42:23.333 --> 42:25.995
(theme music playing )
