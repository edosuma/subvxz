Never touch that.

I'm looking forward to our ride today.
We better go extra hard
to work off these cornballs.

00:55.452 --> 00:59.081
Actually, uh, I can't really go today.

00:59.189 --> 01:03.148
- How's that?
- My bike needs a tune-up or something.

That's okay. Have fun.

- No. He'll be fine.

- Did you go shopping?
- Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.

01:36.793 --> 01:38.954
- Excuse me.
- I paid for it myself.

- With what?
- Company credit card.

01:41.298 --> 01:43.528
- You're returning that.
- But...

- Get a job.
- Michael. Hey, the Cornballer.

It looks like I'm going to be
staying here for a while.

No, it doesn't. It doesn't look like that.
I've got a full house here, Gob.

02:16.099 --> 02:20.001
<i>He's just in a bad mood, Gob,</i>
<i>because his son feels suffocated by him.</i>

02:20.103 --> 02:22.537
- Suffocated? Really?
- <i>Yes, Michael. He's a teenager.</i>

02:22.639 --> 02:25.938
He's probably got a little girlfriend,
and, well, let's face it...

02:26.042 --> 02:30.035
- you are overbearing.
- Maybe I should be more like
you when it comes to parenting.

No borders. No limits. "Go ahead,
touch the Cornballer. You know best."

Michael, if I could stick my
pretty little nose in here for one second.

02:43.059 --> 02:45.527
- You're still not an actor.
- Lovely.

02:45.629 --> 02:47.563
I saw a lot of this type of behavior...

02:47.664 --> 02:52.294
and I think what you're experiencing is
your son's very normal need...

02:52.402 --> 02:56.600
to distance himself from
his overbearing father.

- Buster!

- It's a bird.
- I know it's a bird. I'm on the phone.

- It walked on my pillow.
- Look, I have a child that
costs me money too, you know.

- Why can't you get a job?
- What is it with this family and working?

- <i>[Wings Flapping]</i>
- He didn't invite Buster.

Buster's his brother too.
What's wrong with Buster?

<i>that perhaps it was time to</i>
<i>let her own baby bird fly away.</i>

05:38.802 --> 05:40.633
- Why do I have to take him?
- <i>Because he's your brother.</i>

You run around with everyone else,
going on bike rides, making cornholes.

- Mom, listen...
- Everyone's laughing, riding
and cornholing except Buster.

And I know he's not the sharpest knife
in the drawer, but he's sensitive, Michael...

to be interested in him.

a change of clothes.

- Michael.

What's he doing here?
Why is he in his bathing suit?

Mom dropped me off
to spend time with Michael.

Spend time with Michael,
or to serve her own menopausal needs?

06:28.084 --> 06:31.576
She's always got to wedge herself in
the middle of us, so she can control everything.

<i>Mom's awesome.</i>

06:36.526 --> 06:38.426

Let me ask you something.

06:56.512 --> 06:59.811
Is this a business decision, or is it personal?

06:59.916 --> 07:02.714
'Cause if it's business,
I'll go away happily.

But if it's personal, I'll go away.

- Watch this.

11:29.018 --> 11:32.146
Okay, everybody.
Well, we've lost a leading lady...

11:32.255 --> 11:36.055
but did you know in Shakespeare's day
that the women's roles...

11:36.159 --> 11:38.787
were played by men?

11:38.895 --> 11:40.988
Fancy that.

11:42.064 --> 11:44.532
Hmm.

11:44.634 --> 11:47.432
George Michael,
you know Steven's lines, yes?

11:47.537 --> 11:49.562
- Sort of.
- Fine. Then you are my Benedict.

11:49.672 --> 11:52.971
- And Steven Holt... Where is Steven Holt?
- Steve Holt!

11:53.075 --> 11:56.875
Yes. Get ready for the acting challenge
of your sweet young life, fair lady.

11:56.979 --> 11:59.004
For you are my Beatrice.

- You're in prison.

- Yeah, and it's tough.

the same mistake your mom made with Buster.

- Yeah, boy. What happened there?
- <i>I really don't know.</i>

12:55.171 --> 12:58.299
Maybe it was the 11 months
he spent in the womb.
