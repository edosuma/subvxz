00:11.255 --> 00:13.130
Your girlfriend's birthday - I love it.

00:13.546 --> 00:15.963
-Keep a low profile.
-I'm just your roommate.

00:17.296 --> 00:19.005
-And your colleague.
-Yeah.

00:19.088 --> 00:22.380
You know, like <i>Pinky and the Brain.</i>
A real team.

00:22.463 --> 00:23.880
They'll buy me, for sure.

00:24.588 --> 00:26.755
Particularly
the <i>Dead Poets Society</i> fans.

00:27.130 --> 00:29.921
-"O Captain! My Captain!"
-Right...

00:30.713 --> 00:33.130
So now it's the <i>Dead Poets Society</i>
from Marseille?

00:33.546 --> 00:38.046
Hey, the teacher from the calanques
who silences the cicadas...

00:38.630 --> 00:40.296
-and the sun...
-No.

00:41.713 --> 00:42.963
-OK, not Marseille.
-No.

00:44.921 --> 00:47.505
-Nor <i>Dead Poets Society,</i> all right!
-Thank you.

00:47.588 --> 00:50.046
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:50.130 --> 00:52.088
THE LAME PLAN

00:52.171 --> 00:53.838
THE CRAZY PLAN

00:53.921 --> 00:56.463
THE BOOTY PLAN

00:56.546 --> 00:58.421
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

00:58.505 --> 01:00.963
Surprise!

01:01.046 --> 01:03.546
Not bad, a bit punchier, all right?

01:03.630 --> 01:05.380
Philippe? Happy face.

01:05.463 --> 01:07.255
Matthieu? Less depressed.

01:07.338 --> 01:08.713
Charlotte? More meerkat.

01:10.088 --> 01:11.088
Ten minutes!

01:11.630 --> 01:13.505
I don't know what we're doing here.

01:13.588 --> 01:16.880
You always moan about not seeing
my friends. Now's your chance.

01:18.838 --> 01:21.255
-Don't leave me.
-I won't.

01:31.338 --> 01:32.255
Hey...

01:32.338 --> 01:34.255
-Hey!
-I love your style.

01:34.338 --> 01:36.213
-Thanks.
-It's great you're so at ease.

01:37.005 --> 01:38.921
I mean, in your condition.

01:39.005 --> 01:42.171
Very, very tight and very sparkly.

01:42.505 --> 01:45.463
Yes, I'm Katarina Witt, figure skater.

01:46.338 --> 01:48.046
Olympic champion in '84 and '88.

01:48.671 --> 01:50.463
The '80s! Tonight's theme.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.171
Well, the theme
which was changed behind my back!

01:54.255 --> 01:55.796
"Walk of shame" was better.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.921
Cells in the bowl, Polaroids for the pics.

01:59.005 --> 02:00.255
It's the '80s, guys!

02:00.880 --> 02:02.046
-Seriously?
-Yes!

02:04.171 --> 02:07.171
Champagne for the beautiful Gaïa,
welcome! Here you go.

02:07.255 --> 02:09.505
-'80s!
-Walk of shame!

02:09.588 --> 02:11.296
-In the '80s!
-Walk of shame!

02:11.380 --> 02:13.338
-No!
-To us!

02:15.255 --> 02:16.880
Coats this way, follow me.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.213
Oh, Antoine. "I'm coming." About time!

02:26.171 --> 02:28.213
Nine minutes! Everybody, hide!

02:30.755 --> 02:32.046
He's taking the piss.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.588
I'm making a big effort
because dinner with your dad...

02:37.671 --> 02:38.505
Shit!

02:38.796 --> 02:42.671
-Fuck! No! Open up! It's me!
-Mom, don't start!

02:42.963 --> 02:45.296
I have an idea, let's go back downstairs.

02:45.380 --> 02:46.921
Two floors for the glutes. -Tighten them up.
-No, Mom!

02:48.630 --> 02:50.130
You need it, come on!

02:50.213 --> 02:51.546
-Let's go!
-"Come on..."

02:51.630 --> 02:53.088
Come on, for real.

02:53.171 --> 02:55.005
Otherwise, we'll be early for...

02:56.421 --> 02:59.755
-Oh, no...
-Don't worry, Mom, I can fake it.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.796
-Sorry, darling...
-Come on!

03:02.505 --> 03:03.505
Open up!

03:05.005 --> 03:07.046
Three, two, one...

03:07.505 --> 03:09.380
Surprise!

03:09.463 --> 03:10.671
No!

03:12.588 --> 03:14.713
Surprise...

03:15.505 --> 03:16.505
Whoa...

03:17.963 --> 03:21.213
-You guys are crazy!
-I'll handle the music.

03:23.630 --> 03:27.255
-I really didn't expect this!
-Oh, yeah?

03:27.338 --> 03:28.338
Really?

03:29.005 --> 03:32.630
-Give me your coat, cell in the bowl.
-Yeah! OK!

03:33.171 --> 03:35.130
-Louder, Matt!
-Yes!

03:39.171 --> 03:40.171
You OK?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.713
I'm so happy!

03:46.421 --> 03:47.421
Hey. Good evening.

03:54.713 --> 03:56.338
You sure you were invited?

04:20.630 --> 04:21.630
Hey, you!

04:23.380 --> 04:25.588
-Happy birthday!
-Thanks, Daddy.

04:25.671 --> 04:26.671
Wait a sec.

04:26.755 --> 04:28.921
Let me take a photo. Hang on.

04:29.005 --> 04:30.338
There you go, step forward.

04:31.296 --> 04:32.713
-Like this?
-Yeah.

04:38.296 --> 04:40.130
Come on, let's take a pic together!

04:40.880 --> 04:42.505
-Photo!
-Photo!

04:43.880 --> 04:45.213
-All good?
-Yes! OK, OK!

04:47.921 --> 04:50.880
-One, two, three...
-Waikiki!

05:04.338 --> 05:05.838
Look at Gaïa in the pic.

05:07.671 --> 05:10.546
-Oh, yeah, you can't see her.
-You're such bitches!

05:14.921 --> 05:17.963
-Come on, come on!
-Come on!

05:29.921 --> 05:32.130
-Are you OK?
-This bouncer here is my sister.

05:33.588 --> 05:35.213
And that guy, there...

05:35.296 --> 05:36.671
he's the traitor.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.588
-What about your class?
-Where were you?

05:40.671 --> 05:42.380
-I got away.
-You've been drinking.

05:42.463 --> 05:44.338
-Roman, nice to meet you.
-Guys!

05:44.421 --> 05:45.421
Nice to meet you.

05:45.838 --> 05:48.005
This Taliban here is my girlfriend.

05:48.546 --> 05:50.630
Not my wife, my girlfriend.

05:51.255 --> 05:52.546
We're not married.

05:53.630 --> 05:57.213
I was with some mates and I smoked loads.

05:58.588 --> 05:59.588
Yeah, all right.

06:00.171 --> 06:02.255
Happy birthday!

06:04.921 --> 06:05.921
He's drunk... Yeah...

06:07.505 --> 06:09.630
I'm happy you came.

06:09.713 --> 06:12.796
-Hello. Roman, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

06:14.755 --> 06:17.671
It was my idea to invite him in case

06:17.755 --> 06:21.005
you had the idea of throwing me
a surprise party without me knowing,

06:21.088 --> 06:23.296
of course,
because I absolutely didn't know.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.421
-So, I thought he could...
-Very well.

06:25.505 --> 06:29.005
-We can get to know each other. Sweet!
-Yes. You're so sweet.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.296
This is so cute.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.880
You like each other already.

06:32.338 --> 06:33.755
Did Matthieu go this way?

06:34.505 --> 06:36.713
-Yeah...
-I'll go find the traitor.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.046
-Take it easy, it's Elsa's birthday.
-I want to kill him.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.880
Please, for once, think about me.

06:46.255 --> 06:48.171
Antoine! Now's not the time!

06:55.421 --> 06:56.421
You're an asshole.

06:59.338 --> 07:00.838
But I got used to the idea.

07:09.046 --> 07:09.880
Right...

07:11.630 --> 07:14.796
-Wait, used to the idea of what?
-Of us, I think.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.338
Of us? Like, you and me?

07:17.755 --> 07:20.963
Like hand heart, lovey-dovey couple, ew?

07:21.713 --> 07:24.088
-"Ew"? Really?
-Yeah, it's a trap!

07:25.505 --> 07:29.671
-We go rather well together, don't we?
-"Go rather well together..."

07:29.755 --> 07:33.255
Leggings and Converse go well together
but I can also wear jeans, get it?

07:33.880 --> 07:37.130
-No, not really.
-I don't mind if you see other chicks.

07:37.921 --> 07:38.921
Am I interrupting?

07:39.505 --> 07:42.171
-No, we were talking about clothes.
-Great.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.713
Eviction operation. I'll take the whore,
you take Harry Potter.

07:45.796 --> 07:47.755
-I mean, Henri Pottier. Now.
-OK.

07:49.838 --> 07:51.963
So, you're a teacher too?

07:52.713 --> 07:55.963
Well seen.
Did the velvet jacket give me away?

07:56.046 --> 07:57.046
His classical side.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.255
I'm actually a Latin teacher.

08:02.838 --> 08:03.880
At primary school?

08:05.171 --> 08:07.005
Well, I...

08:07.421 --> 08:09.755
I need to borrow him a sec,
birthday secret.

08:09.838 --> 08:10.838
-OK.
-Come.

08:14.838 --> 08:16.963
Fancy a... beer?

08:18.338 --> 08:19.588
<i>Veni, vidi, vici.</i>

08:21.088 --> 08:22.088
Latin...

08:22.963 --> 08:26.005
I like Elsa,
I don't need to be paid to be here.

08:27.088 --> 08:29.963
Listen, I want to believe
what you're saying, really.

08:30.046 --> 08:32.421
In other circumstances,
we could have been mates.

08:32.505 --> 08:35.005
But you booked me
because you love her, no?

08:35.088 --> 08:36.296
-Yes.
-Right.

08:36.380 --> 08:39.338
No one could have predicted this,
so let her choose!

08:39.421 --> 08:43.255
But you're the Frankenstein of sex.
A big green-eyed lie.

08:43.338 --> 08:44.505
You don't even exist.

08:45.380 --> 08:48.130
And that will destroy her. Get it?

08:49.171 --> 08:51.463
Because you two have done nothing wrong.

08:52.588 --> 08:55.463
If Elsa finds out the truth,
you'll be in trouble too. Yes, we'll all be in trouble.
But some more than others.

09:00.296 --> 09:01.296
We'll see.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.963
Hey, I'm not saying this
just to be a pain.

09:05.630 --> 09:08.755
I get that you want to play a role,
be part of our group.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.671
But you'll never be like us.

09:20.713 --> 09:24.505
-I trained as a dancer so...
-Oh, right! Sorry.

09:24.588 --> 09:27.338
Tell them to stop the coke
in the bathroom. I'm bursting.

09:27.421 --> 09:29.380
-Right.
-Are you flirting to evict him?

09:31.171 --> 09:34.546
Who's that "passionately curious"
trashy chick with Matt?

09:34.963 --> 09:37.046
She's Cédric's guest. His cousin.

09:37.130 --> 09:39.463
-Lives in London.
-She didn't dress for the theme.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.671
-She did.
-She didn't.

09:40.755 --> 09:44.088
Hey, you forgot the theme!
It's supposed to be the '80s!

09:44.171 --> 09:45.671
-She didn't!
-The '80s, really?

09:47.588 --> 09:48.755
She didn't dress for it.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.130
Get rid of him now.

10:15.255 --> 10:18.338
Hey! You didn't dance like this
before our divorce.

10:20.588 --> 10:22.921
Just saying, though. I don't care.

10:23.380 --> 10:24.380
Of course not. 30 years old.

10:27.588 --> 10:29.380
You must have done something wrong.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.255
-I don't know what but...
-What are you saying?

10:32.338 --> 10:35.046
I don't know, what 30-year-old
still lives with her dad?

10:35.130 --> 10:36.963
You're smothering her.

10:38.380 --> 10:41.546
Listen, this is her night, let her be.

10:41.630 --> 10:42.630
Cheers!

10:44.046 --> 10:46.046
I actually work at the SRS.

10:46.838 --> 10:48.171
You mean at the CNRS?

10:49.171 --> 10:50.713
-Exactly.
-Right, OK.

10:50.796 --> 10:55.088
So, you wrote a thesis on quantum physics
and you teach Latin at primary school?

10:55.171 --> 10:57.963
-Is that not frustrating?
-I'd say it's pretty dodgy.

10:59.796 --> 11:01.963
Teaching is the art of adapting oneself.

11:02.505 --> 11:05.005
I mean, Latin is dope!

11:05.088 --> 11:06.088
I love it!

11:11.421 --> 11:12.755
Bottoms up!

11:14.380 --> 11:15.880
I love it!

11:26.171 --> 11:28.630
-She's out of line!
-Forget about it.

11:42.755 --> 11:43.755
Wait, no.

11:44.421 --> 11:46.588
What? Are you ashamed of me?

11:46.671 --> 11:50.713
No, not at all. It's just...
This is very new to me, that's all.

11:51.296 --> 11:52.546
It's new to me too.

11:53.963 --> 11:54.963
Here.

11:56.588 --> 11:57.921
I have something for you.

12:00.046 --> 12:01.046
A gift!

12:02.213 --> 12:04.713
Whoa! A pig?

12:05.338 --> 12:06.338
Miss Piggy. So cute.

12:09.921 --> 12:11.755
The gift is actually inside.

12:15.630 --> 12:18.713
-So cute! A USB stick!
-No!

12:18.796 --> 12:21.588
-I mean, yes, but the gift is <i>inside.</i>
-Oh, right.

12:21.671 --> 12:23.505
It's kind of homemade but...

12:24.338 --> 12:25.338
it's for you. Thank you.

12:30.630 --> 12:31.963
Don't mind me!

12:36.880 --> 12:37.880
Mom, I... This is Jules.

12:40.255 --> 12:41.255
Great!

12:42.046 --> 12:44.380
Look, honey. Look what I made you.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.130
A beautiful cake.

12:46.755 --> 12:47.755
There you go!

12:48.505 --> 12:52.380
You'll be pleased,
there are only 130 calories per slice.

12:52.921 --> 12:55.380
So you don't get fat.
Now's the time to be careful!

12:56.380 --> 12:57.213
Right?

12:59.296 --> 13:00.546
How are you, Jérôme?

13:01.755 --> 13:04.088
Have fun! This is cool.

13:06.088 --> 13:07.338
Your mom seems nice.

13:08.505 --> 13:09.505
Are you OK?

13:10.671 --> 13:12.796
Yeah, it's just that photo isn't me.

13:13.963 --> 13:15.421
Oh, right. Who is it?

13:15.838 --> 13:19.171
It's my sister, Anaïs. You know,
the one who's more... everything.

13:19.255 --> 13:20.255
Right, OK. You know what?

13:24.630 --> 13:28.880
As much as I like your mom,
this is one ugly-ass cake, no?

13:30.380 --> 13:31.546
There we go. Look.

13:32.630 --> 13:33.630
Safe place for it.

13:34.421 --> 13:36.755
If we get hungry, there's pizza.

13:37.546 --> 13:38.463
No?

13:38.546 --> 13:41.588
With Cha and Milou, that's our ritual:

13:41.671 --> 13:44.671
two flavors, three girls, six slices.

13:45.380 --> 13:46.380
Whoa...

13:46.463 --> 13:47.921
And I eat both flavors.

13:49.588 --> 13:51.005
And I think you're beautiful.

13:54.171 --> 13:56.005
Hey, lovebirds!

13:56.088 --> 13:57.296
You're so cute!

14:40.005 --> 14:44.255
Five, four, three, two, one...

14:47.380 --> 14:48.588
See? I told you.

14:49.213 --> 14:50.213
Unbelievable. Can I hang?

14:56.380 --> 14:59.546
-I'm not sure this is great for the baby.
-Not at all.

14:59.630 --> 15:00.463
Here.

15:02.463 --> 15:03.463
OK...

15:13.255 --> 15:14.755
Things seem a bit tense.

15:15.713 --> 15:16.713
Totally.

15:17.838 --> 15:19.921
What about you, with Elsa?

15:20.838 --> 15:22.296
Is it serious or...?

15:22.921 --> 15:24.963
I mean, she introduced you to her parents.

15:25.588 --> 15:27.505
Knowing Elsa, that means something.

15:28.421 --> 15:33.838
-You know how to stress a guy out.
-Dude, stress-wise, I have my fair share.

15:36.380 --> 15:39.880
-I'm struggling to deal with it too.
-Don't deal with it.

15:39.963 --> 15:41.130
Let off some steam!

15:42.130 --> 15:45.296
It's simple. I box every Sunday
at 5 p.m. in the 8th.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.630
Come along if you want.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.171
Silence, please!

15:51.463 --> 15:54.505
Elsa! Young Elsa
is wanted in the living room!

15:55.588 --> 15:57.213
Yes... Milou!

15:57.671 --> 15:59.338
-So formal!
-Yep.

15:59.421 --> 16:01.171
Queen of the night, right? Milou!

16:02.671 --> 16:03.755
Right, well...

16:03.838 --> 16:08.755
We lied to you, the online kitty
was full to bursting, right, Milou?

16:10.838 --> 16:12.421
Yeah, absolutely!

16:12.505 --> 16:16.380
We wanted to get you a gift
that reflects you, a special gift.

16:16.463 --> 16:17.755
A generous gift.

16:19.963 --> 16:20.963
You're crazy! Yeah, crazy...

16:31.088 --> 16:32.088
A cow?

16:32.171 --> 16:35.130
A gnu! Saved from the slaughterhouse
by you. Meet Caroline!

16:35.713 --> 16:37.755
You're her sponsor! Amazing, right?

16:38.046 --> 16:38.880
Right?

16:39.963 --> 16:41.463
Thanks, everyone. And thanks to "gnu".

16:44.505 --> 16:47.046
That's the last time I contribute online.

16:48.255 --> 16:49.921
1,200 euros! Fuck!

16:50.505 --> 16:53.921
Caroline earns more than me!
Milou should marry her.

16:54.338 --> 16:56.796
-Caroline!
-Thanks, buddies!

16:57.338 --> 17:00.213
-It's so cool!
-You'll need to write to her.

17:00.296 --> 17:01.630
-You think?
-No!

17:02.213 --> 17:03.588
It's a gnu!

17:06.380 --> 17:07.380
So?!

17:07.463 --> 17:09.296
-You OK, honey?
-Great!

17:10.046 --> 17:11.046
A gnu! Right, OK...

17:17.630 --> 17:18.630
Sorry.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.546
-You teach at Jeanne d'Arc, right?
-Yes.

17:24.088 --> 17:26.463
Was it not renamed Simone Veil last year?

17:27.005 --> 17:29.421
Yes, of course, force of habit.

17:31.171 --> 17:32.671
You teach in 1,000-euro shoes?

17:35.463 --> 17:36.463
They were a gift.

17:37.630 --> 17:38.921
That wasn't my question.

17:39.921 --> 17:41.213
I know where to get a deal.

17:42.130 --> 17:45.088
Does your ugly buddy know too,
with his 800-euro Jordans?

17:46.171 --> 17:49.796
-At least, he knows how to dance!
-He better take it easy.

18:02.088 --> 18:03.338
Haven't we met?

18:03.921 --> 18:05.421
I don't think so.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.338
Hey, buddy. The chick at 11 o'clock.

18:12.005 --> 18:13.380
She's not hitting on me.

18:13.463 --> 18:14.796
Not at all.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.421
She's setting me on fire.

18:17.213 --> 18:18.921
Hey, easy, tiger.

19:09.796 --> 19:11.171
Right, enough of that.

19:11.588 --> 19:12.588
Leave me alone.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.546
What if the baby were to come now?

19:16.255 --> 19:17.255
Huh?

19:21.296 --> 19:23.796
I'd pray for the baby
to be cooler than you.

19:24.588 --> 19:25.588
What?!

19:28.671 --> 19:29.921
Who are you texting?

19:38.963 --> 19:40.130
Thanks for the invite.

19:40.796 --> 19:43.963
Sorry about the other day.
I think... I was a bit blunt.

19:44.713 --> 19:45.838
We're even.

19:46.588 --> 19:48.838
I was never the queen of finesse either.

19:49.713 --> 19:51.713
Not to be mistaken with fitness. Shit, you're so not funny!

19:56.171 --> 19:59.421
I'm really happy to be here.
You mean a lot to me.

19:59.505 --> 20:02.255
-I'm sorry?
-You mean a lot to me.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.213
I'm exhausted, shall we go?

20:11.921 --> 20:14.546
Honey, it's only 11 p.m.
and it's Elsa's 30th.

20:15.296 --> 20:18.296
-But you promised--
-The one time we go out, Gaïa...

20:21.338 --> 20:22.630
Forget it. I'll go.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.130
Sorry, this isn't going to work.

21:29.463 --> 21:31.005
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

21:33.963 --> 21:34.963
Here.

21:35.421 --> 21:37.796
It's only small
but I thought you'd like it.

21:39.255 --> 21:40.463
Thanks.

21:40.546 --> 21:42.630
-Shall I open it?
-You shouldn't have. Yes.

21:44.046 --> 21:45.046
-May I?
-Yes. Thank you.

22:02.671 --> 22:05.005
You know what?
I shouldn't fucking be here.

22:08.088 --> 22:13.380
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

22:13.463 --> 22:18.380
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

22:18.796 --> 22:24.463
<i>Happy birthday, dear Elsa</i>

22:24.880 --> 22:30.546
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

22:32.505 --> 22:33.505
Where's Jules?

22:33.588 --> 22:34.630
Happy birthday!

22:35.380 --> 22:36.213
Blow!

23:50.838 --> 23:51.838
<i>Hey, Elsa.</i>

23:53.171 --> 23:55.713
<i>Here's a song I wrote for you,</i>
<i>for your birthday.</i>

23:57.463 --> 23:59.880
<i>I hope you like it. That's it.</i>

24:00.421 --> 24:01.421
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

24:09.130 --> 24:12.046
<i>Your Katie chucked you out</i>
<i>Your Katie chucked you out</i>

24:12.130 --> 24:15.213
<i>Your Katie chucked you out</i>
<i>Your Katie chucked you out</i>

24:48.130 --> 24:49.838
Heading home from work, miss? Or maybe you're starting?

25:09.838 --> 25:12.463
TRYING NOT TO THINK ABOUT YOU
SO WATCHING NETFLIX.

25:12.546 --> 25:13.546
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

25:13.630 --> 25:15.796
-YOU NEVER BORE ME.
-HOPE I DIDN'T BORE YOU.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.005
-GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.
-NOT TOO DRUNK?

25:35.338 --> 25:39.005
What's good about you gays
is that you're supposed to be open-minded.

25:39.796 --> 25:41.505
Just go for it, Chantal.

25:41.588 --> 25:43.296
I'm a great opportunity for you.

25:43.380 --> 25:45.213
A new experience.

25:46.380 --> 25:47.838
Understand what I'm saying?

25:50.380 --> 25:51.380
Chantal?

25:51.713 --> 25:52.963
Where are you going?

25:53.546 --> 25:57.046
-We can just be friends, that works.
-OK but shut up.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.588
Shall we share an Uber?

26:30.255 --> 26:31.255
I'm sorry...

26:46.505 --> 26:48.380
I did something awful to Elsa.
