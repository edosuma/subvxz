This weekend the Industrial
Furnishing Convention

10:04.908 --> 10:06.562
Your tone is so unlikable,

All mean and gross.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.139
Those fucks are
trying to rile me.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.532
Just try to act cute, a little.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.230
Come on.

10:33.154 --> 10:36.244

And my silly ideas

10:36.287 --> 10:40.204
are a cute way
to not sunburn my cheeks.

11:06.578 --> 11:07.841
Ah!

11:07.884 --> 11:10.582
We got five sales
off that baby talk shit.

11:10.626 --> 11:13.411
You know,
Mama was the master at it.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.718
She used to do
all the pitching for Daddie.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.720
She was a beauty queen.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.941
She knew how to sell
anything to men.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.508
Well, yep, like, like they say,

11:23.552 --> 11:25.728
Mama was
a goddamn special woman.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.338
Yeah.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.906
She told me once,
when buying my first bra,

11:29.950 --> 11:33.693
that "men do not respect
your femininity

11:33.736 --> 11:36.957
unless you are
manipulating them with it."

11:37.000 --> 11:39.046
Mom died before I got boobs.

11:39.089 --> 11:42.092
And Dad took me to buy
my first bra, so I guess

11:42.136 --> 11:43.877
I missed that terrible tip.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.314
Listen, lady. I'm the awning
darling at this Con!

11:46.357 --> 11:48.708
-So back off!
-What? What?

11:48.751 --> 11:51.319
I will not back off,
I'll front on.

11:51.362 --> 11:52.973
That doesn't make sense.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.801
And you're going down.

11:56.106 --> 11:59.153
You gonna let that cheap tramp
take what's yours?

11:59.196 --> 12:00.720
[laughs]:
No!

12:00.763 --> 12:03.505
-What is she taking?
-Uh, all the sales!

12:03.548 --> 12:05.725
You should outsell
Awn Point this year.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.031
That would blow Daddie's mind.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.903
I do want to impress him,
Brenna.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.166
And I do want to sell my ideas.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.255
They could hit big

12:14.298 --> 12:16.605
if we got a big buy
from a big chain, imagine it!

speak for themselves.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.741
Well, they haven't yet.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.438
But they'll sell.

to playing this game.

Okay, so maybe...

12:35.102 --> 12:36.843
she did trick me.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.540
Oh, right.

I do here to get justice

12:45.547 --> 12:47.331
without looking like a racist?

12:47.375 --> 12:49.029
Maybe stop worrying
about how you look

12:49.072 --> 12:50.813
and worry about what you do.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.860
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's insane talk.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.973
Okay, listen.

19:52.016 --> 19:55.890
Guys, my designs
put shade on your target area

19:55.933 --> 19:58.762
for 96% of the day.

19:58.806 --> 20:01.287
What happened?
I literally can't hear her.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.463
Is something wrong with the mic?

20:03.506 --> 20:05.421
I can't hear a word
she's saying,

20:05.465 --> 20:07.989
but her body language
is so off-putting, man.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.686
I'm out.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.167
Hey! Listen, you fuckers!

20:12.211 --> 20:14.822
You were in on this idea
a second ago!

20:14.865 --> 20:17.259
I humiliated myself all weekend

20:17.303 --> 20:18.826
to get these sales!
[stammers]

20:18.869 --> 20:20.697
Where do you think
you're going, buddy?

20:20.741 --> 20:22.612
-[indistinct chatter]
-A waste of time.

20:22.656 --> 20:23.657
Just a waste of my time.

20:30.794 --> 20:33.275
[baby voice]:
Don't you just wuv this awning?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.277
I have a master's degwee.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.626
[slurping bottle]

20:36.670 --> 20:38.889
[cheering, clamoring]

20:38.933 --> 20:40.369
Don't start.

20:40.413 --> 20:43.111
A Manhattan, please, hon.
[chuckles]

20:43.154 --> 20:44.678
I just got to know, was all this

20:44.721 --> 20:46.636
more of your Loki and Thor shit?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.682
Did you know it would be
more fun for you

20:48.725 --> 20:50.988
to watch me crash and burn
on the biggest stage?

20:51.032 --> 20:54.470
[gasps]
I'm not that conniving.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.385
Am I? [chuckles]

20:56.429 --> 20:58.648
Yes, you are.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.694
Well, listen.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.523
Your ideas are great.

21:03.566 --> 21:06.395
But leave the pitching
to Daddie.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.267
You think my ideas are great?

21:08.310 --> 21:10.660
[chuckles]
Well...

21:10.704 --> 21:12.836
-cheers!
-Oh, no.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.490
This one's for you, too.

21:14.534 --> 21:17.014
I've already had
my four ounces of wine today.

21:17.058 --> 21:19.060
Later, sis.

21:27.068 --> 21:29.723
Hey, man, look, I-I gave Shauna
20 bucks. I need it back.

21:29.766 --> 21:31.768
[stammers]
What are you talking about?

21:31.812 --> 21:34.597
Look, she-she sold me some
coupons for fast food and...

21:34.641 --> 21:36.207
[stammers] I can't believe
it's true,

21:36.251 --> 21:39.646
because Shauna's so cool
and everything, but...

21:39.689 --> 21:41.865
turns out, they're a scam.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.867
How do you know it's a scam?

21:43.911 --> 21:45.565
Did you go to the right ones?

21:45.608 --> 21:46.740
Uh, come again?

21:46.783 --> 21:49.395
You got to go
to the right franchises.

21:49.438 --> 21:50.787
That's what she told me.

21:50.831 --> 21:53.050
I've got
three of those coupon pages

21:53.094 --> 21:54.922
I have been waiting
to cash in...

21:54.965 --> 21:57.054
Oh, wait. Wait.

21:57.098 --> 21:59.100
Uh, oh-oh, shit!

21:59.143 --> 22:02.712
She got you and me both
on this one.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.540
Goddamn it!

22:04.584 --> 22:06.716
H-Hold on one second.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.762
[bottle caps pop]

22:11.852 --> 22:14.245
You know, I've always wondered
how this would feel.

22:14.289 --> 22:16.944
A guy like me fitting in
with a guy like you.

22:16.987 --> 22:19.250
Shit. Just two dads,

22:19.294 --> 22:21.252
drinking some Buds, talking.

22:21.296 --> 22:22.906
Oh, man!

22:22.950 --> 22:25.039
So, uh, you know this...

22:25.082 --> 22:27.084
Irish Heritage Foundation?

22:27.128 --> 22:29.435
Yeah. That's the favorite
charity or whatever

22:29.478 --> 22:32.525
of Kelley Frakes and all sorts
of rich white people, right?

22:32.568 --> 22:35.354
No, man. That is just Shauna.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.008
She set it up knowing white
folks would give money to it.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.184
She uses it to fund
her soccer team.

22:40.228 --> 22:43.144
And she funnels money
to her school through it.

22:43.187 --> 22:44.624
Oh, she's good. She's real good.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.016
I didn't even see the header

22:46.060 --> 22:47.235
when I bought
these coupons from her.

22:47.278 --> 22:50.412
[chuckles]
Wow, she's like a Robin Hood.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.240
That's so cool, man.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.373
Now, d-do you mind if I get,
like, a selfie here,

22:54.416 --> 22:57.071
or is that-that cool...?

23:00.814 --> 23:03.164
[laughs]

23:06.254 --> 23:09.562
I couldn't do
the baby talk thing, either.

23:09.605 --> 23:12.260
I did do it a long time ago,
but I gave it up.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.784
And now I'm the head

23:14.828 --> 23:17.221
of the Jolly Night Inn
hotel chain.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.049
Yeah? No shit?

23:19.093 --> 23:21.443
No shit, listen.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.272
[whispers]:
I am Shirley Temple.

23:24.315 --> 23:27.710
But... Shirley Temple died.

23:27.754 --> 23:30.539
That's what I wanted
the world to believe.

23:30.583 --> 23:34.456
I had to maintain
that cutesy baby persona

23:34.500 --> 23:36.458
throughout my career
as a movie star,

23:36.502 --> 23:39.635
then as a diplomat
and as an ambassador.

23:39.679 --> 23:42.116
That's why I decided
to fake my own death

23:42.159 --> 23:44.945
and become a powerful
businesswoman in my old age.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.686
You know,

23:46.729 --> 23:49.602
you're a very smart gal.

23:49.645 --> 23:53.214
Seriously. I heard about
the self-adjusting awnings.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.259
I'm intrigued.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.305
Really? Okay.

23:57.348 --> 23:59.829
Let me tell you about
a little something called

23:59.873 --> 24:02.353
Town Cloud.

24:02.397 --> 24:04.704
Yeah, it's a huge, shared awning

24:04.747 --> 24:07.576
that an entire town can share
so that we block out

24:07.620 --> 24:09.796
that bastard sun,
but at the same time,

24:09.839 --> 24:12.581
we exploit all its power
with solar panels.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.236
So, like, if you're, like, if
you're the sun. No, you stand...

24:15.279 --> 24:16.933
-Wait, where are you going?
-You know what, forget it.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.718
Good luck out there, Debbie.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.459
And forget we ever met.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.243
Shirley Temple's dead.

24:25.942 --> 24:28.118
Goddamn it.

24:28.162 --> 24:30.469
World ain't ready for me.
