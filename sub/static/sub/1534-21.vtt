00:00.269 --> 00:02.406
Previously on Once Upon A Time...

00:02.627 --> 00:03.739
Daniel's grave.

00:04.369 --> 00:05.264
Mother!

00:05.264 --> 00:07.232
She ripped his heart out.

00:07.266 --> 00:09.834
All the dark deeds I've
done poisoned my heart.

00:09.868 --> 00:12.069
- Who do you want found?
- My daughter.

00:12.103 --> 00:13.504
Your lilith might be the one

00:13.538 --> 00:16.139
who keeps Ms. Swan on her dark path.

00:16.174 --> 00:18.308
Your parents are monsters, Emma.

00:18.343 --> 00:19.943
They banished me and
threw you in a wardrobe.

00:19.978 --> 00:20.878
She wants revenge.

00:20.912 --> 00:23.981
Marian...
she's my sister Zelena.

00:24.015 --> 00:26.216
She's pregnant.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.932
Stop the carriage.

00:41.966 --> 00:44.166
Whoa!

00:55.078 --> 00:57.346
Good day, citizens.

00:57.381 --> 00:59.181
Enjoying the meadow?

00:59.216 --> 01:03.052
Indeed. It seemed perfect
for our wedding ceremony.

01:03.086 --> 01:04.352
It is lovely.

01:04.388 --> 01:06.889
But see, the thing is,

01:06.924 --> 01:10.459
these are part of the royal lands,

01:10.493 --> 01:14.797
and I don't recall giving
you permission to marry here.

01:14.831 --> 01:16.364
We didn't know.

01:16.399 --> 01:17.733
We had just... uhh!

01:17.767 --> 01:19.134
Oh!

01:19.168 --> 01:20.268
Your majesty.

01:20.303 --> 01:23.405
Could you be overreacting
because of what day it is?

01:23.440 --> 01:25.908
Don't talk to me about this day, daddy.

01:25.942 --> 01:28.677
But you need the support of
your citizens, your majesty.

01:28.711 --> 01:31.847
To alienate them would
be shortsighted and weak.

01:31.881 --> 01:33.381
I'm not weak!

01:39.288 --> 01:43.224
I was going to spare you, but
someone just made me angry.

01:54.470 --> 01:57.572
Next time there's a wedding,

01:57.606 --> 02:00.040
book the church.

02:05.546 --> 02:07.914
Make your way home.

02:07.949 --> 02:10.283
I have someplace to go.

02:32.673 --> 02:34.273
Mother.

02:37.678 --> 02:40.013
It's been too long.

02:59.365 --> 03:00.833
So...

03:00.867 --> 03:02.935
Yeah.

03:02.969 --> 03:06.572
So you moved on. With her.

03:06.606 --> 03:09.474
That's not fair. You understood.

03:09.509 --> 03:10.475
You agreed.

03:10.510 --> 03:13.678
Understanding it and
seeing it are different.

03:13.712 --> 03:16.348
That's hardly the most
important point here.

03:16.382 --> 03:17.382
My son.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.518
Zelena's not gonna keep
wearing that glamour,

03:19.552 --> 03:20.652
and Roland's not gonna understand

03:20.686 --> 03:21.853
where his mother's gone.

03:21.887 --> 03:23.321
For him to lose her again...

03:23.356 --> 03:24.956
a forgetting potion.

03:24.990 --> 03:29.193
Just take him back to before
the fake Marian showed up.

03:29.227 --> 03:31.328
He'll lose time, but it's better, right?

03:31.363 --> 03:34.933
Yes. Thank you.

03:34.967 --> 03:38.002
God, poor Marian.

03:38.037 --> 03:40.838
And Zelena...

03:40.873 --> 03:42.440
Just killing her like she meant nothing

03:42.474 --> 03:44.508
so she could play out
this sad farce with us.

03:44.543 --> 03:45.842
I just... I wanna...

03:48.346 --> 03:49.646
But I can't.

03:51.349 --> 03:53.551
I mean, I-I knew that
things didn't feel right,

03:53.585 --> 03:55.519
but I just didn't know why.

03:57.322 --> 04:00.391
I'm sorry. This was all about me.

04:00.425 --> 04:02.559
For her, this was all about...

04:02.594 --> 04:05.528
Making sure I never get my happy ending.

04:05.563 --> 04:09.466
If by happy ending, you mean us, then...

04:09.500 --> 04:11.735
At least, in a way, that's possible again.

04:11.769 --> 04:16.072
Look, it's messy, I know, but...

04:16.107 --> 04:17.406
Between us...

04:17.440 --> 04:20.543
Is a huge obstacle.

04:20.577 --> 04:22.077
And it's going to get bigger every day,

04:22.113 --> 04:23.980
and not just for nine months either.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.848
It's a lifetime she has cooking in there.

04:25.882 --> 04:28.684
No matter what happens from now on,

04:28.719 --> 04:30.987
there's going to be this child.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.656
You're tied together in a way...

04:33.690 --> 04:37.426
In a way we'll never be.

04:37.460 --> 04:38.928
I'm such an idiot to think that

04:38.962 --> 04:40.997
life wouldn't kick me in the teeth again.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.101
I hear you.

04:45.135 --> 04:46.435
Just...

04:46.469 --> 04:48.838
Just what?

04:48.872 --> 04:52.073
What do we do now?

04:55.616 --> 04:57.746
Can't believe this survived all that time.

04:57.780 --> 05:00.415
This place that belonged to your...

05:00.450 --> 05:02.784
His name was Neal.

05:02.818 --> 05:06.388
He was a lot of things to me.

05:06.422 --> 05:09.223
Now he's just gone, thanks to her.

05:10.660 --> 05:11.660
Sorry?

05:16.632 --> 05:17.732
I think I just felt it kick.

05:17.767 --> 05:20.635
You wouldn't want to rattle
an expectant mother now,

05:20.670 --> 05:23.404
would you?

05:23.438 --> 05:26.073
Everyone, pack up. You, too.

05:26.107 --> 05:29.043
We're going back to Storybrooke. Tonight.

05:34.683 --> 05:36.584
What is this?

05:36.618 --> 05:38.219
It's a bagel.

05:38.253 --> 05:39.420
Is it?

05:40.789 --> 05:43.123
Did you hear?

05:43.158 --> 05:45.092
This is why I hate this place.

05:46.961 --> 05:48.729
Are you sure you wanna start the day

05:48.763 --> 05:51.298
- by tangling with the Dark One?
- Hmm.

05:51.332 --> 05:55.602
The Dark One who can't strike
back without charring his heart.

05:55.636 --> 05:58.271
You're toothless, old dog.

05:58.306 --> 06:01.074
So I get to give you the good news.

06:01.108 --> 06:04.644
Emma's already on her
way back. And guess what?

06:04.679 --> 06:05.978
She didn't turn evil after all.

06:06.013 --> 06:08.815
So I get to find my happiness,

06:08.849 --> 06:11.884
and you will never find yours.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.923
Now for you, never is a
long, long time.

06:21.494 --> 06:22.762
Well, that's bad news.

06:22.796 --> 06:24.964
Emma's in charge of happy endings
around here.

06:24.998 --> 06:27.366
The ink has to contain her blood.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.535
It has to governed by her dark impulses.

06:29.569 --> 06:31.537
No dark savior... No ink.

06:31.571 --> 06:34.106
You okay?

06:35.575 --> 06:37.643
What was he saying about your heart?

06:39.379 --> 06:40.646
I'll be perfectly fine

06:40.680 --> 06:42.681
once I find another way to get that ink.

06:42.716 --> 06:44.983
You think there's a loophole?

06:45.017 --> 06:46.952
Well, there always is.

06:46.986 --> 06:49.520
Let's go.

06:53.659 --> 06:56.027
Forget walking.

06:56.062 --> 06:57.328
I have a better idea.

07:15.847 --> 07:17.047
Emma.

08:03.393 --> 08:05.394
Hey. All right.

08:07.097 --> 08:10.800
Maleficent...

08:10.834 --> 08:12.768
This is Lily.

08:12.803 --> 08:14.437
This is your daughter.

08:23.952 --> 08:25.552
You show up

08:25.586 --> 08:29.289
on the anniversary of
killing the man that I loved?

08:30.897 --> 08:33.760
To what, rub salt in the wound?

08:34.421 --> 08:35.578
To apologize.

08:36.027 --> 08:37.054
I see.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.902
How did you get out of the looking glass?

08:40.958 --> 08:43.328
I borrowed a rabbit.

08:43.361 --> 08:45.961
Wonderland's an amazing place.

08:45.961 --> 08:47.030
And I've learned a lot.

08:47.510 --> 08:51.146
I understand now why
you had to send me away.

08:51.181 --> 08:55.050
Without me, you've become
your own person, and...

08:55.084 --> 08:56.651
And I'm very proud of you.

08:56.686 --> 08:59.888
What do you want, mother?

08:59.923 --> 09:02.156
To help you.

09:02.191 --> 09:05.694
You've got beauty and strength and power.

09:05.728 --> 09:08.863
I just wanna help you
get that final piece...

09:08.897 --> 09:10.332
love.

09:10.366 --> 09:11.845
I had that piece.

09:13.085 --> 09:16.722
You took it and tore its heart out.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.190
The Stable Boy.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.058
Daniel!

09:20.092 --> 09:24.129
His name was Daniel.

09:24.163 --> 09:25.831
Yes.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.659
I made a terrible mistake.

09:27.659 --> 09:29.560
You see, I was fine
with a loveless marriage.

09:29.595 --> 09:32.196
I thought you'd be the same.

09:32.230 --> 09:34.465
And now I realize that you feel things

09:34.499 --> 09:36.633
more deeply than I do.

09:36.667 --> 09:39.003
No, you really do.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.205
You deserve more than I had.

09:41.239 --> 09:43.007
Little late, isn't it?

09:43.041 --> 09:45.809
Oh, we both know that's not true.

09:45.843 --> 09:49.480
I had an encounter with
a certain wingless fairy

09:49.514 --> 09:50.714
who told me of a failed attempt

09:50.748 --> 09:52.883
to connect you with your soul mate.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.818
You met tinker bell?

09:54.852 --> 09:56.586
Indeed.

09:56.621 --> 09:59.155
She told me, Regina.

09:59.189 --> 10:02.058
There is someone out there for you,

10:02.092 --> 10:04.594
someone you're fated to be with,

10:04.629 --> 10:06.362
and I'm here to find him.

10:08.598 --> 10:11.934
I'll believe it when I see it.

10:11.968 --> 10:16.005
No, I mean it.
I've no reason to escape.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.409
And with that cuff, you won't
have the magic to do it either.

10:19.443 --> 10:21.577
Oh, look.

10:21.611 --> 10:23.445
Home.

10:23.479 --> 10:25.213
Mmm. Dank.

10:25.248 --> 10:28.450
Isn't it? I'm glad I thought of it.

10:28.484 --> 10:30.452
And right upstairs, our O.B., Dr. whale,

10:30.486 --> 10:32.955
gives the finest care this
side of the fictional alps.

10:32.989 --> 10:35.858
- The perfect temporary home.
- Yes.

10:35.892 --> 10:37.860
This home is temporary.

10:37.894 --> 10:43.098
But me being in your life
is not, because this...

10:43.132 --> 10:44.699
Means forever.

10:44.733 --> 10:47.536
Okay, Zelena.

10:47.570 --> 10:49.404
You wanna start talking truth?

10:49.439 --> 10:51.073
Tell me,

10:51.107 --> 10:52.907
why are you so confident?

10:52.942 --> 10:56.644
Tell me, what's gonna
make you feel safe at night

10:56.679 --> 10:58.245
once that baby's born?

10:58.280 --> 11:00.715
The fact that if you kill me,

11:00.749 --> 11:04.418
Robin will always know that you murdered

11:04.453 --> 11:06.588
the mother of his child.

11:06.622 --> 11:09.791
You underestimate me, Zelena.

11:09.825 --> 11:11.626
Enjoy your new home.

11:22.770 --> 11:25.772
Get anything on blood magic,

11:25.807 --> 11:27.841
but be quick.

11:27.875 --> 11:30.210
I've just remembered something
in the back that might help.

11:54.835 --> 11:57.136
What are you doing here?

12:03.409 --> 12:04.810
What do you want?

12:04.845 --> 12:07.013
I want The Author.

12:07.047 --> 12:09.715
Finding him was my idea
before you stole it.

12:12.786 --> 12:15.487
What's wrong with you? You look terrible.

12:15.522 --> 12:17.356
Nothing. I'm fine.

12:17.390 --> 12:20.559
Oh, it's your heart, isn't it?

12:20.593 --> 12:22.894
It's finally happening.

12:22.928 --> 12:25.297
Yeah.

12:25.331 --> 12:28.634
It's dying.

12:28.668 --> 12:31.203
Bad news for you and me both.

12:31.237 --> 12:34.906
You said it would kill
your ability to love.

12:34.940 --> 12:37.475
You didn't say that...

12:37.509 --> 12:41.312
The Dark One can't die, not like that.

12:41.346 --> 12:43.381
No,

12:43.415 --> 12:45.917
but Rumplestiltskin can.

12:45.951 --> 12:49.054
A friendly warning...

12:49.088 --> 12:51.489
you don't wanna face the Dark One

12:51.523 --> 12:52.856
when there's no one else at home.

12:52.891 --> 12:57.562
So I suggest you don't antagonize me.

12:57.596 --> 13:00.364
Oh, but it doesn't really matter.

13:00.399 --> 13:03.067
By definition, when I get my happy ending,

13:03.101 --> 13:05.336
I'll be... Guess what?

13:05.370 --> 13:07.338
Happy.

13:07.372 --> 13:09.539
So I don't really care
what you'll be up to.

13:09.574 --> 13:12.342
No, you...

13:12.376 --> 13:14.845
You're just being shortsighted.

13:14.879 --> 13:17.014
Look.

13:17.048 --> 13:20.217
I have the quill.

13:20.251 --> 13:23.721
You and I can...

13:23.755 --> 13:26.022
Work together.

13:26.056 --> 13:30.560
We... we could figure out a
way to... to find that ink.

13:30.595 --> 13:34.931
Yes, you look like you're up
for some serious collaboration.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.034
Thank you.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.869
I'll figure out the ink on my own.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.003
No, no, no.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.441
- Good-bye, dearie.
- No.

14:11.111 --> 14:15.080
You are too good for this place, m'lady.

14:16.265 --> 14:17.390
You'd be surprised.

14:18.702 --> 14:19.835
Who are you?

14:19.870 --> 14:21.836
They call me Nottingham.

14:21.871 --> 14:24.506
The sheriff of Nottingham, actually.

14:28.445 --> 14:31.547
Come.

14:31.581 --> 14:33.550
My name's Cora,

14:33.550 --> 14:35.451
and I'm looking for a man.

14:35.486 --> 14:37.320
Well...

14:37.354 --> 14:39.454
A specific man.

14:39.489 --> 14:44.960
He has a tattoo on his arm of a lion...

14:44.995 --> 14:47.162
Right here.

14:49.265 --> 14:51.199
Robin Hood.

14:51.234 --> 14:53.869
Sounds like you're
talking about Robin Hood.

14:53.904 --> 14:55.073
Tell me more, sheriff.

14:55.073 --> 14:57.005
Oh, no, no, no, you
don't want him, darling.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.408
He is a sanctimonious blowhard

14:59.442 --> 15:01.510
who thinks he's better than
all the other thieving bastards

15:01.544 --> 15:04.579
because he steals from the rich...

15:04.613 --> 15:06.915
To give to the poor and
won't shut up about it.

15:06.949 --> 15:10.585
- That sounds insufferable.
- Mm.

15:10.619 --> 15:13.588
But my daughter has her heart set on him.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.557
The things we do for our children.

15:15.591 --> 15:17.559
Mmm.

15:17.593 --> 15:20.094
Well, he's all married up now, I hear,

15:20.128 --> 15:23.064
to some sickly little tart
that no one else would want.

15:23.098 --> 15:27.234
Wives can be gotten rid of, so I hear.

15:31.106 --> 15:33.707
I think I could help you find him...

15:33.741 --> 15:36.777
For a price.

15:39.214 --> 15:41.615
Maybe I'm closer to finding
what I was looking for

15:41.649 --> 15:44.184
than I realized.

15:44.218 --> 15:46.152
Let's talk some more.

15:48.155 --> 15:51.091
So if I have this straight,

15:51.125 --> 15:54.527
you thought Emma was going
to go dark, and she didn't.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.463
So the whole operation's dead?

15:56.497 --> 15:57.586
Right.

15:57.765 --> 16:01.234
The energy of her darkest
potential has to charge the ink.

16:01.268 --> 16:04.170
Okay, let's think.

16:06.306 --> 16:08.775
It's a shame. I mean...

16:08.809 --> 16:10.676
Writing a happy ending for the Evil Queen.

16:10.711 --> 16:13.213
Well, you... you've always
been a favorite of mine.

16:13.247 --> 16:16.116
Very clear goals plus
totally damaged personality

16:16.150 --> 16:17.683
with a self-destructive streak?

16:17.718 --> 16:19.719
A recipe for compelling.

16:19.753 --> 16:21.019
And of all the characters I've written for,

16:21.054 --> 16:23.222
you really do get screwed over the most.

16:23.257 --> 16:25.124
I'm well aware.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.293
By the way, I-I was only
working with Rumplestiltskin

16:27.327 --> 16:29.094
because he was able to protect me.

16:29.129 --> 16:31.731
So, you can trust me.

16:31.765 --> 16:34.166
And you can really do as you say?

16:36.302 --> 16:40.239
Take a look at this.

16:42.742 --> 16:44.076
This page...

16:44.110 --> 16:48.814
It says my happy ending
is possible, doesn't it?

16:48.848 --> 16:51.383
I mean, it has to exist for a reason.

16:51.417 --> 16:53.652
Whoa.

16:53.686 --> 16:55.219
I wrote this.

16:55.254 --> 16:59.257
I mean, the story with this
drawing in it, from my...

16:59.292 --> 17:03.227
Well, a-a little
experimental writing I did

17:03.262 --> 17:07.131
for another book that I
never got the chance to write.

17:07.165 --> 17:08.900
Where did you get this?

17:08.934 --> 17:13.171
It just turned up one
day in Robin's things.

17:13.204 --> 17:16.073
I don't know how that happened,
but it... yeah, it suggests

17:16.108 --> 17:18.142
that something is looking out for you.

17:18.176 --> 17:20.243
Something?

17:20.279 --> 17:22.512
Well, could you be more vague?

17:22.547 --> 17:23.814
You know as well as I,

17:23.848 --> 17:26.249
there are forces greater than all of us.

17:26.284 --> 17:28.285
But no matter how you got
that, gosh, I am a fan.

17:28.319 --> 17:31.154
I'd be happy to write
whatever you want if...

17:31.189 --> 17:32.656
You only had the ink.

17:32.691 --> 17:34.858
Oh, I already figured that part out.

17:34.892 --> 17:38.495
I know exactly where to find it.

17:41.398 --> 17:43.733
You're so beautiful.

17:45.636 --> 17:48.371
Sorry. I just...

17:48.405 --> 17:51.374
Just... You are, that's all.

17:53.211 --> 17:54.510
So how are we gonna get revenge

17:54.545 --> 17:56.679
on Snow White and Prince Charming?

17:56.714 --> 17:59.134
Now that I see you,

18:00.403 --> 18:02.871
I don't wanna waste our time on revenge.

18:02.905 --> 18:06.508
I understand why you want it.

18:06.542 --> 18:09.978
It's suddenly so clear we
should only look forward.

18:10.013 --> 18:12.046
Seriously?

18:12.080 --> 18:13.648
We're gonna let them get away with this?

18:13.682 --> 18:15.884
We can be happy in the future

18:15.918 --> 18:17.886
or we can be angry about the past.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.554
Let's do both.

18:19.588 --> 18:22.456
Look, all these years since I figured out

18:22.491 --> 18:25.292
what happened, I-I've
been trying to figure out

18:25.327 --> 18:30.031
how two humans could get me
away from a Freakin' dragon.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.799
But now I get it.

18:32.834 --> 18:34.535
You're a pushover.

18:34.569 --> 18:38.639
What'd they do, rub your
belly? Give you a dragon treat?

18:38.673 --> 18:40.074
Lily...

18:40.108 --> 18:42.410
No.

18:42.444 --> 18:44.512
I did everything I could.

18:44.546 --> 18:51.818
But all I wanna do now is
enjoy our time together.

18:51.853 --> 18:55.055
I am your mother.

18:55.089 --> 18:57.024
Well, I'm grown up now.

18:57.058 --> 18:59.492
I don't need grooming
advice from Annie hall.

18:59.527 --> 19:03.363
- I gotta go.
- Wait! Wait.

19:03.397 --> 19:05.731
Please.

19:05.766 --> 19:08.535
If you go, if you leave
town, you can't get back in.

19:08.569 --> 19:10.736
I can't leave at all.

19:10.771 --> 19:13.039
I'll crumble back into the dust that I was

19:13.074 --> 19:14.774
before Gold revived me.

19:14.808 --> 19:16.709
Man, that's a bummer.

19:16.743 --> 19:19.378
Please.

19:19.412 --> 19:22.915
Can't you just wait a little while longer?

19:22.950 --> 19:25.618
Things could look different in a week.

19:25.652 --> 19:29.055
Send me a postcard.

19:38.249 --> 19:38.807
David.

19:38.967 --> 19:40.801
I'm not here to kill you.

19:40.836 --> 19:42.436
Okay...

19:42.470 --> 19:44.939
I just...
I just want my daughter.

19:44.973 --> 19:46.607
Lily isn't with you?

19:46.642 --> 19:47.942
She's leaving.

19:47.976 --> 19:51.311
And you think we can help.

19:51.346 --> 19:53.180
Come in.

19:53.214 --> 19:57.251
You cast the second curse. Can you...

19:57.285 --> 19:59.019
Is there a way for you to seal the borders

19:59.054 --> 20:00.521
the way Regina did?

20:00.555 --> 20:02.356
I don't know how to do what you want.

20:02.390 --> 20:04.358
But that wouldn't be the right way, anyway.

20:04.392 --> 20:06.160
If she's upset,

20:06.194 --> 20:07.994
you have to get to the
heart of what's wrong.

20:08.029 --> 20:10.530
I don't know what's
wrong. I don't know her.

20:10.565 --> 20:12.599
Well, she's acting a lot like Emma did

20:12.633 --> 20:13.767
when she first came here.

20:13.801 --> 20:15.869
She had these...

20:15.903 --> 20:17.503
Her walls were always up.

20:17.538 --> 20:22.008
She was afraid that if she
opened herself up to me,

20:22.043 --> 20:24.844
I would let her down
like everyone else had.

20:24.879 --> 20:27.547
And... Ultimately, I did.

20:27.581 --> 20:30.716
If you have any way to help...

20:30.750 --> 20:34.019
You didn't give her back to me then,

20:34.054 --> 20:38.558
but please, if you can help, do it now.

20:38.592 --> 20:41.194
Yes.

20:41.228 --> 20:43.729
Come on, David, let's find her.

20:43.763 --> 20:48.500
Thought I might find you here.

20:48.534 --> 20:52.738
Fair warning... bus service
in these parts can be spotty.

20:52.772 --> 20:54.673
It's going to be a wait.

20:54.708 --> 20:56.809
Missed the part where that's your problem.

20:56.843 --> 20:59.011
Shove off.

20:59.045 --> 21:00.878
I bet that mouth got you lots of attention

21:00.913 --> 21:04.649
back at the group home,
but it doesn't work here.

21:04.683 --> 21:07.319
Now...

21:07.353 --> 21:08.987
Listen up.

21:11.224 --> 21:13.825
I've got some talking to do.

21:20.933 --> 21:22.066
Cora.

21:22.101 --> 21:23.534
How... I thought...

21:23.568 --> 21:24.969
Yes, hello, get out, Henry.

21:29.074 --> 21:30.775
Why are you here?

21:30.809 --> 21:32.876
I have news.

21:32.910 --> 21:34.044
I found your man.

21:34.078 --> 21:36.913
You found him?

21:36.948 --> 21:38.815
He's on his way.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.784
He's on his way?

21:40.818 --> 21:42.386
Mother.

21:42.420 --> 21:44.255
Come.

21:53.497 --> 21:55.966
You remembered.

21:58.803 --> 22:00.503
I love this color.

22:02.006 --> 22:04.174
I can't believe you did all this.

22:04.208 --> 22:06.842
I told you, I've learned.

22:06.877 --> 22:10.680
Thank you.

22:10.714 --> 22:12.081
For the dress.

22:12.115 --> 22:15.017
Oh, you're welcome, darling.

22:15.052 --> 22:18.120
Now turn around and meet him.

22:28.165 --> 22:29.765
Your majesty.

22:38.041 --> 22:40.709
I think I'll leave the two of you alone.

22:40.743 --> 22:43.978
Enjoy your evening together.

22:50.253 --> 22:52.787
You know, this apple tree

22:52.822 --> 22:55.323
used to stand near where I grew up?

22:57.593 --> 23:01.295
There was a Stable Boy I liked once,

23:01.330 --> 23:03.798
and we used to meet underneath it.

23:03.833 --> 23:05.466
Stable Boy?

23:07.236 --> 23:08.269
Well, you certainly
have come up in the world

23:08.303 --> 23:12.340
since consorting with a
lowly Stable Boy, I'd say.

23:12.374 --> 23:15.309
Have I?

23:15.344 --> 23:18.512
I don't feel like I've
gone anywhere but down.

23:18.547 --> 23:21.315
Oh, you just need...

23:21.350 --> 23:25.686
Some manly arms to lift you up.

23:25.721 --> 23:28.088
Now you let me be the strong one

23:28.123 --> 23:32.159
so that you can be weak
when you want to be.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.526
Weak?

23:33.561 --> 23:35.195
Well...

23:35.230 --> 23:37.131
Feminine.

23:40.534 --> 23:43.036
Manly arms...

23:43.071 --> 23:44.104
Like these?

23:44.139 --> 23:46.573
Hello, there.

23:46.607 --> 23:48.207
Oh!

23:48.242 --> 23:49.776
Glory of...

23:49.810 --> 23:52.178
What are you doing?!

23:52.212 --> 23:55.114
That's not a real tattoo. That's magic.

23:55.149 --> 23:56.683
Who put that on there?

23:56.717 --> 23:58.285
Stop it. Ah!

23:58.319 --> 23:59.552
Was it mother?!

23:59.587 --> 24:02.221
Ah! Yes! Ah!

24:02.256 --> 24:04.857
She told me
to pretend to be your soul mate,

24:04.892 --> 24:06.959
and that I could be the king.

24:06.994 --> 24:09.595
Ah, just it off me!

24:09.629 --> 24:11.530
What does she get out of it?

24:11.564 --> 24:12.731
Ow! Just stop it!

24:12.766 --> 24:14.867
What does she get out of it?!

24:14.902 --> 24:17.136
She said that she wanted you
to have a child.

24:21.240 --> 24:22.140
What?

24:22.175 --> 24:23.975
She said she wanted you to have a child.

24:24.010 --> 24:27.145
And I... and I don't know why.

24:31.318 --> 24:35.220
You know about Snow and
Charming getting you banished,

24:35.254 --> 24:38.123
putting Emma's potential
for darkness into you.

24:38.157 --> 24:40.992
Sent me through the portal in my eggshell,

24:41.027 --> 24:43.161
like baby Moses in his basket.

24:43.196 --> 24:46.215
And unless you have any ideas about
giving them what they deserve...

24:46.215 --> 24:50.035
Let's not worry about what they deserve.

24:50.036 --> 24:52.670
Let's work on what we deserve.

24:52.705 --> 24:55.005
I deserve them dead.

24:55.040 --> 24:58.309
Well...

24:58.344 --> 25:01.212
You do have some darkness
in you, don't you?

25:03.515 --> 25:05.983
Thing is, a lot of that darkness,

25:06.017 --> 25:07.617
that actually belongs to Emma.

25:07.652 --> 25:12.256
And right now, it's good and riled up.

25:12.290 --> 25:18.162
And riled up savior darkness
is exactly what I need.

25:18.196 --> 25:20.726
The only thing you need,
lady, is to get out of my way.

25:21.671 --> 25:23.719
And here I thought we could
have a civil conversation.

25:26.014 --> 25:29.283
Guess I should just cut to the chase.

25:29.317 --> 25:31.218
Hey! Stop! Ah!

25:31.252 --> 25:34.154
You're out of your mind!

25:37.525 --> 25:39.460
Welcome to Storybrooke.

26:08.855 --> 26:10.956
Lily?

26:21.501 --> 26:23.168
Lily.

26:34.538 --> 26:38.107
So how did it go?

26:38.141 --> 26:41.110
He's not still here, is he?

26:41.144 --> 26:42.311
Oh, but he is.

26:44.547 --> 26:46.515
He wanted to see the dungeon.

26:46.549 --> 26:49.484
Oh, for heaven's sake,
you're having a tantrum.

26:49.519 --> 26:51.686
There.

26:51.721 --> 26:53.522
He's home now, poor thing.

26:53.556 --> 26:55.757
Why'd you let him go?

26:55.792 --> 26:59.327
Don't you want someone else
to suffer for what you did?

26:59.361 --> 27:02.531
- Like usual.
- I don't understand.

27:02.565 --> 27:04.433
I thought you were getting along.

27:04.467 --> 27:06.267
Well...

27:06.302 --> 27:10.939
I haven't known a lot of love in my life,

27:10.973 --> 27:12.407
but...

27:14.576 --> 27:17.178
I do know

27:17.212 --> 27:20.014
that's not what a soul mate feels like.

27:22.484 --> 27:28.823
Your so-called "soul mate"
is a married, moralizing sap.

27:28.857 --> 27:31.291
The one I found is much better.

27:33.595 --> 27:37.030
You were never interested in my happiness.

27:41.536 --> 27:42.870
Hello, Zelena.

27:42.904 --> 27:44.839
Oh, visitors.

27:44.873 --> 27:46.239
I'll put the kettle on.

27:46.274 --> 27:49.676
I've got The Author and I've got the ink.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.878
I wanted you to witness the moment

27:51.912 --> 27:54.581
he writes me my heart's desire.

27:54.615 --> 27:57.584
See, this is my town

27:57.618 --> 27:59.719
and this is my story.

27:59.753 --> 28:01.321
You've just been a supporting player

28:01.356 --> 28:02.456
this whole time.

28:02.490 --> 28:06.493
Yeah, see,
I'm not here to support you.

28:06.527 --> 28:08.862
I'm here to replace you.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.931
Out with the old, and in with the new.

28:11.966 --> 28:14.033
Really?

28:14.067 --> 28:15.401
We'll see about that.

28:15.435 --> 28:17.604
Wait.

28:17.638 --> 28:20.106
What exactly is he going to write?

28:20.140 --> 28:22.341
Oh, I've given that a lot of thought.

28:22.376 --> 28:25.911
There are so many good options.

28:25.945 --> 28:29.181
But I think, after much deliberation,

28:29.216 --> 28:34.786
I've come up with the
perfect ending for you, sis.

28:34.821 --> 28:37.188
What are we lookin' at?

28:37.223 --> 28:39.290
The horizon.

28:39.325 --> 28:41.092
Is it doing something?

28:41.127 --> 28:44.062
Well, I just thought you'd find it calming.

28:44.096 --> 28:46.097
It is. So is rum.

28:49.802 --> 28:53.138
Emma, I can tell that your heart is uneasy.

28:53.172 --> 28:56.408
And it's my job...
well, I hope it's my job,

28:56.442 --> 28:57.509
to protect your heart,

28:57.543 --> 29:00.578
even when no one is
physically trying to steal it.

29:00.612 --> 29:02.480
You don't have to stop
me from going after Gold.

29:02.515 --> 29:03.781
I'm smarter than that.

29:03.815 --> 29:05.216
He didn't turn my heart dark,

29:05.251 --> 29:07.052
and I'm not gonna fall
into one of his traps.

29:07.086 --> 29:08.420
I'm not worried him getting to your heart.

29:08.454 --> 29:09.954
I was talking about your parents.

29:09.988 --> 29:12.089
Oh, we talked about this.

29:12.123 --> 29:15.459
I talked, you walked away.

29:15.493 --> 29:17.061
I just wanna know, is
anything gonna be enough?

29:17.095 --> 29:19.564
Or are you willing to lose
them just to spite them?

29:19.598 --> 29:22.733
Gimme back the rum.

29:22.768 --> 29:24.501
They've done a lot of good.

29:24.536 --> 29:26.570
Turned themselves into heroes.

29:26.604 --> 29:31.508
Yes. I know they didn't
own up to what they did.

29:31.543 --> 29:34.078
But did you ever think
maybe they were ashamed?

29:34.112 --> 29:35.745
And they wanted you to like them.

29:35.780 --> 29:37.614
I'd like them more if...

29:37.648 --> 29:41.485
I'd known they turned themselves around.

29:41.519 --> 29:44.955
I like when people find their
good hearts along the way.

29:44.989 --> 29:49.192
They were trying to
protect you, Swan. Twice.

29:49.226 --> 29:50.460
Before you were born, they
wanted to make you happy.

29:50.494 --> 29:55.498
And when they found you again,
they wanted to make you proud.

29:55.532 --> 29:59.602
Do you want both those to be failures?

30:06.310 --> 30:07.676
It headed this way.

30:07.711 --> 30:09.878
- She.
- Thank you.

30:09.913 --> 30:11.046
I'm worried.

30:11.081 --> 30:13.549
You need to be taught to
fly, and she was way too low.

30:13.584 --> 30:16.819
If one wing tip hit a tree,
she could be badly hurt.

30:16.853 --> 30:19.655
And maybe hurt a lot of
people around you, too.

30:19.689 --> 30:21.890
David.

30:24.494 --> 30:26.028
Oh, she...

30:26.062 --> 30:28.631
She looks like me.

30:31.534 --> 30:32.567
Be careful.

30:32.602 --> 30:35.670
She's my daughter.

30:42.778 --> 30:43.978
Mary Margaret, no!

30:44.013 --> 30:46.648
Stop! She's out of control!

30:51.219 --> 30:52.654
Mary Margaret!

30:52.688 --> 30:54.756
Aah!

30:54.790 --> 30:56.390
Uhh!

30:57.626 --> 31:00.061
No!

31:14.190 --> 31:15.224
Mom?!

31:15.922 --> 31:18.015
She hit her head hard.

31:18.952 --> 31:19.961
No, stay still.

31:22.753 --> 31:24.294
It's gonna take time to heal inside.

31:28.041 --> 31:30.376
I'm sorry I let you down again.

31:30.411 --> 31:31.678
You didn't.

31:31.712 --> 31:34.247
No, I was selfish.

31:35.242 --> 31:38.744
Yes, you were, but at some
point this has to stop.

31:38.779 --> 31:41.714
Emma, I'm not ever going to stop
trying to protect you, not ever.

31:41.714 --> 31:44.448
- I don't care what you do or say.
- I know.

31:44.482 --> 31:46.684
I need to stop punishing you.

31:48.753 --> 31:49.753
You do?

31:51.556 --> 31:54.057
You're a hero.

31:54.092 --> 31:57.461
If it happened at my expense,
it doesn't change anything.

31:57.495 --> 31:59.429
It doesn't change the
good person you became,

31:59.463 --> 32:01.598
and it doesn't change what you are.

32:01.632 --> 32:04.801
Which is what?

32:04.836 --> 32:06.770
My mom.

32:10.341 --> 32:12.976
You wanted to make me proud,

32:13.010 --> 32:16.446
so you li... omitted the truth,

32:16.480 --> 32:18.881
which was kind of
self-defeating, but human.

32:18.915 --> 32:21.618
Cutting you out and trying to hurt you

32:21.652 --> 32:23.953
has just made me miserable.

32:26.022 --> 32:28.958
Anyway, I miss you

32:28.992 --> 32:31.427
and I forgive you.

33:10.065 --> 33:11.599
Are you all right?

33:11.633 --> 33:15.336
I'm not sure just yet.

33:19.875 --> 33:21.776
You know,

33:21.810 --> 33:25.112
I was going to give you something earlier.

33:25.146 --> 33:26.714
This was supposed to be yours,

33:26.748 --> 33:29.650
but I never got a chance to give it to you.

33:35.757 --> 33:37.525
It's too late, isn't it?

33:37.559 --> 33:41.328
You're too grown up for everything.

33:41.362 --> 33:43.864
You don't need me.

33:43.898 --> 33:46.133
And I know that I'm not...

33:46.167 --> 33:48.836
I'm not what you were hoping for.

33:51.772 --> 33:55.475
I thought that you'd be
this scary dragon bitch,

33:55.509 --> 33:58.144
and we'd go get our revenge.

33:58.178 --> 34:02.849
You know, blasting all
those who did us wrong.

34:04.918 --> 34:10.857
But you're just... This real person.

34:10.891 --> 34:13.993
And you're so frickin' open, it kills me.

34:14.027 --> 34:15.928
Why does that kill you?

34:15.963 --> 34:18.231
I don't understand. Please, tell me.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.667
Because you want a relationship,

34:21.701 --> 34:23.835
a future.

34:23.871 --> 34:26.906
And anyone who's ever wanted
that with me, it's just...

34:26.940 --> 34:30.676
It's never worked out.

34:30.710 --> 34:33.712
I've always let them down.

34:33.746 --> 34:37.047
I destroy everything that I touch.

34:37.083 --> 34:42.053
That darkness they put in
me, it's serious business.

34:42.088 --> 34:45.857
I don't mind a little darkness.

34:52.398 --> 34:53.899
Look...

34:55.634 --> 34:57.936
Why don't you stay for a week,

34:57.970 --> 35:01.005
and I can teach you about
being a scary dragon bitch?

35:02.808 --> 35:04.542
Okay.

35:04.576 --> 35:06.010
One week.

35:09.515 --> 35:11.949
You're just mad because
I have with Robin Hood

35:11.983 --> 35:14.886
what you've always wanted.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.320
A child.

35:16.354 --> 35:18.255
No, I already have a child.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.423
Henry.

35:19.457 --> 35:24.061
No, what I'm mad about is
you trying to come between us.

35:24.095 --> 35:26.830
About you trying to hurt me.

35:26.864 --> 35:29.300
Now I'm going to see
to it that you can never

35:29.334 --> 35:31.468
hurt anyone else again.

35:31.502 --> 35:35.906
Our author here is going to
write you out of the story.

35:39.009 --> 35:40.276
Forever.

35:40.311 --> 35:43.346
Sorry, sis.

35:43.380 --> 35:44.848
I think you're bluffing.

35:44.882 --> 35:46.983
You'd never take away Robin's baby.

35:47.017 --> 35:48.985
That's not how I look at it.

35:49.019 --> 35:53.489
You see, as far as everyone
will be concerned, including me,

35:53.523 --> 35:56.826
it'll be as though you never existed.

35:56.860 --> 35:59.595
Wait, can he do that?

35:59.629 --> 36:01.664
Just change all of your memories?

36:01.698 --> 36:03.366
Absolutely.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.435
The pen is mightier than the...

36:05.469 --> 36:07.636
Well, everything.

36:12.041 --> 36:14.844
Well...

36:14.878 --> 36:17.379
I never knew our mother,

36:17.413 --> 36:20.015
but I imagine I'm getting
to know her right now.

36:20.049 --> 36:22.685
Is that so?

36:22.719 --> 36:26.524
She tossed me in a basket, sent me to oz.

36:26.524 --> 36:30.194
She gave up a baby without
even blinking an eye.

36:30.229 --> 36:33.164
And look at you now.

36:33.198 --> 36:36.133
You are exactly like her!

36:40.137 --> 36:42.939
You'll never be happy.

36:42.974 --> 36:44.842
You don't know how.

36:44.876 --> 36:47.845
But you do understand power,

36:47.879 --> 36:50.113
and you're about to lose it.

36:50.147 --> 36:54.251
Your people want Snow White to be queen.

36:54.285 --> 36:56.419
And unless you start building a dynasty,

36:56.453 --> 36:59.923
she'll take back the kingdom,
and you'll lose it all.

36:59.957 --> 37:03.426
And when I die of a mysterious illness,

37:03.460 --> 37:08.965
you're the power behind the
child-sized throne, right?

37:09.000 --> 37:13.235
Well, guess what, mother?

37:13.270 --> 37:16.739
I found a way to keep
that from ever happening.

37:16.774 --> 37:18.140
What is that?

37:18.174 --> 37:20.242
A potion,

37:20.277 --> 37:23.780
to take away your future
claim on the royal line.

37:23.814 --> 37:25.882
But you're not pregnant.

37:25.916 --> 37:27.950
And now I never will be.

37:30.420 --> 37:33.488
I won't be a baby mill for you, mother.

37:33.523 --> 37:36.825
You'd never
do that. This is a sham.

37:36.859 --> 37:38.593
Is it?

37:38.628 --> 37:39.962
You made it clear

37:39.996 --> 37:43.966
you don't think anyone's going to love me.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.834
So why not make it official?

37:45.868 --> 37:48.269
After all,

37:48.304 --> 37:50.639
love is weakness.

37:50.673 --> 37:53.809
I was wrong about that.

37:53.843 --> 37:57.979
The man... I really thought
he was a good match.

37:58.013 --> 38:01.416
I'm very sorry.

38:01.451 --> 38:04.819
Now, we both know you're
not going to drink that,

38:04.853 --> 38:09.257
so put it down and we can fix this.

38:09.291 --> 38:11.993
You don't think I'm
strong enough to do this?

38:12.027 --> 38:13.661
Stupid girl.

38:13.695 --> 38:16.630
You think it'll make you
strong to hurt yourself?

38:16.665 --> 38:19.733
Oh, it does if it hurts you more.

38:32.914 --> 38:35.282
No. No.

38:35.316 --> 38:37.484
Get the hell out of my life!

38:37.518 --> 38:40.653
Oh, Regina.

38:42.923 --> 38:45.125
I really did come here to help you.

38:45.159 --> 38:47.794
I love you.

38:47.828 --> 38:50.089
I wanted you to have
a child for your own sake.

38:51.510 --> 38:54.400
If I wanted to take your power...

38:54.434 --> 38:56.536
I'd find a much more direct way.

38:58.873 --> 39:01.975
Now please take one last
piece of motherly advice.

39:02.009 --> 39:03.142
I hope you learn

39:03.176 --> 39:08.047
what it's taken me a lifetime
to realize about myself.

39:08.081 --> 39:11.850
The only one standing in
the way of your happiness

39:11.885 --> 39:13.952
is you.

39:15.755 --> 39:19.925
Go back to wonderland, mother.

39:19.959 --> 39:23.529
I don't need you.

39:23.563 --> 39:26.832
Well, the ink is drying.

39:26.866 --> 39:28.567
So what do you want me to do?

39:31.704 --> 39:34.205
Nothing.

39:34.240 --> 39:38.109
You didn't know our
mother, Zelena, but I did.

39:38.144 --> 39:40.111
And yet, we both suffered.

39:40.146 --> 39:42.480
She hurt you and she hurt me, too.

39:44.083 --> 39:47.052
But our own worst enemy isn't her

39:47.086 --> 39:49.921
or each other.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.689
It's ourselves.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.724
Regina!

39:53.759 --> 39:55.026
Is everything all right?

39:55.061 --> 39:57.962
I've been looking all over for you.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.163
Everything's fine.

39:59.197 --> 40:03.534
I'm so tired of standing in
the way of my own happiness,

40:03.569 --> 40:07.438
and I'm not going to do it anymore.

40:07.472 --> 40:10.207
Aw. Another woman defining her happiness

40:10.241 --> 40:12.242
relative to the love of a man.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.545
It's sad, really.

40:14.579 --> 40:18.082
Oh, don't get it wrong, greenie.

40:18.116 --> 40:21.051
Robin isn't my happy ending.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.853
My happy ending is finally
feeling at home in the world.

40:25.156 --> 40:29.093
Robin's just a part of that world.

40:29.127 --> 40:33.329
A world that you're going to be
forced to watch from a distance,

40:33.363 --> 40:39.135
with the most restrictive
visitation rights in history.

40:39.169 --> 40:40.971
See you at the next ultrasound.

40:45.710 --> 40:48.911
So you don't want me writing anything?

40:51.215 --> 40:52.482
No.

40:52.516 --> 40:56.119
I already have everything I need.

40:57.488 --> 41:00.356
Well, I don't.

41:06.496 --> 41:08.497
- Regina!
- What the...

41:08.531 --> 41:10.099
No.

41:12.135 --> 41:13.769
What does it say?

41:13.803 --> 41:16.471
"Vanishing in a cloud of
smoke, The Author slips away"

41:16.506 --> 41:19.374
"with the ink to where..."

41:19.408 --> 41:23.145
"Mr. Gold awaits."

41:30.386 --> 41:31.553
How?

41:31.587 --> 41:33.054
No, no.

41:33.088 --> 41:35.690
I don't care how.

41:35.724 --> 41:37.191
And I don't wanna waste time.

41:37.225 --> 41:38.960
That's what I thought.

41:38.994 --> 41:40.895
- Are you okay here?
- I soon will be.

41:40.929 --> 41:43.229
- Here.
- Let go of me.

41:43.264 --> 41:44.264
Go and write.

41:46.167 --> 41:47.600
Write on what?

41:57.679 --> 41:59.979
Now then...

42:00.013 --> 42:04.050
It's time villains finally win.
