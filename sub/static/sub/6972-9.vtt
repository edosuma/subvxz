00:12.200 --> 00:14.200
- Dr. Cabrera.
- Where is he?

00:14.200 --> 00:16.200
He's down in trauma. They said
you'd know what's wrong with him.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.300
- Who transferred him from ICU?
- I did-- he was scheduled for, uh...

00:19.300 --> 00:22.000
...therapeutic plasmapheresis. They were
prepping him. He went into shock.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
- What are his vitals?
- Not good. Pulse is 40. Blood pressure 80/50. His GCS is six.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.400
Okay. Get on the phone to the FBI.
There's an Agent Scully that should be notified.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.400
- FBI?
- This man is an FBI agent.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.600
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him is he's going to die.

00:58.800 --> 01:02.800
Can you hear me?
Mr. Skinner?

01:06.900 --> 01:11.300
I'm not understanding.
Can you speak up?

01:15.900 --> 01:17.200
What'd he say?

01:17.200 --> 01:19.000
A name.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.900
He's coding on us.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.700
Clear!

01:30.000 --> 01:32.500
Dr. Cabrera, clear.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.700
Dr. Cabrera!

01:37.900 --> 01:40.400
Let him go.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.100
Every minute of every day we choose.

02:25.100 --> 02:30.700
Who we are. Who we forgive.
Who we defend and protect.

02:30.700 --> 02:36.400
To choose a side or to walk
the line. To play the middle.

02:36.400 --> 02:40.800
To straddle the fence between
what is and what should be.

02:40.800 --> 02:47.300
This was the course I chose. Trying to find the
delicate balance of interests that can never exist.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.300
Choosing by not choosing.

02:49.300 --> 02:53.800
Defending a center which cannot hold.

02:54.100 --> 02:57.100
So death chose for me.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.000
SOUTH STREET GYM
24 HOURS EARLIER

03:06.500 --> 03:11.900
Go easy on him, Slugger.
I need him to lock up for me tonight, okay?

03:30.100 --> 03:35.300
Don't telegraph that left, Dre.
Stevie Wonder would see that one coming.

03:35.500 --> 03:39.600
You're fighting the
FBI now, Dre. Fight smart.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.200
Go!

04:24.000 --> 04:26.200
Hey, Slugger.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.900
You okay?

04:27.900 --> 04:30.700
Slugger, can you hear me?

04:30.900 --> 04:34.500
Talk to me.
You all right?

04:34.800 --> 04:37.700
- Slugger.
- Mr. Skinner.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.200
Mr. Skinner.
Hi.

04:43.300 --> 04:46.300
You going to stick with us now?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.000
Do you remember what happened?

04:50.300 --> 04:53.100
I was boxing.
I must've gotten tagged.

04:53.100 --> 04:56.100
Yes, you did. At least you
didn't get your ear bit off.

04:56.100 --> 05:01.600
That's something, right?
Dr. Plant will be with you in a minute.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.100
Yeah. Skinner.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.600
Hello.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.700
- Walter... Skinner.
- Who is this?

05:31.700 --> 05:39.000
Have... you heard... the news?
It's... in... you.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.500
- What is this?
- You... have... 24 hours... to go.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.800
What is this?
What do you want?

05:48.800 --> 05:54.200
You... are... already dead.

06:00.100 --> 06:05.800
Mr. Skinner. Didn't expect to see you
up and around. You must be feeling better.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.000
Can you take a seat on
that table for me, please?

06:16.600 --> 06:19.300
I'm Dr. Plant.

06:19.300 --> 06:23.200
I was here with you before.
You probably don't remember.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.100
- No.
- Well, the good news is...

06:26.100 --> 06:31.000
...your dilation's back to normal.
Plus you still have both your ears.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.100
I heard that one.

06:33.100 --> 06:40.200
I'm going to release you. But I suggest that
you rethink the boxing. You're not 20 anymore.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.800
There's nothing wrong with me?

06:42.800 --> 06:47.600
Well, you got your bell rung.
Other than that, I think you're fine.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.200
Might want to ice that bruise.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.300
What bruise?

06:55.800 --> 06:58.000
Right here.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.900
- How the hell did I get that?
- Must've taken a hard one to the ribs.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.700
But there's nothing broken.
No internal bleeding.

07:04.700 --> 07:08.800
Like I said... You'll live.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.800
Thanks.

07:40.700 --> 07:43.200
What is it, Agent Mulder?

07:44.600 --> 07:49.400
I just, uh... I thought I'd
poke my head in and say hey.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.000
Hey.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.600
- What, are you sleeping one off?
- No, I was having trouble seeing. It's nothing.
I just didn't think I should drive.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.500
You going to be all right, sir?

08:21.300 --> 08:24.300
He's going to tell you he's all right.

08:24.400 --> 08:29.100
- That's because there's nothing wrong with me.
- Not that I could tell if there was. Why are all the lights out?

08:29.100 --> 08:35.100
He's having trouble with his eyes.
He's also got a nasty bruise on his ribcage.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.299
- What did you do?
- It's nothing.

08:43.400 --> 08:48.600
- Says who?
- Says the doctor who released me from the hospital.

08:50.700 --> 08:54.500
That was the second opinion.
The first was unsolicited.

08:54.500 --> 08:59.600
A phone call at the hospital. A scrambled
voice telling him he had 24 hours to live.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.900
That was somebody yanking my chain.
Look, I got a clean bill of health.

09:06.900 --> 09:11.400
In the last 48 hours, did you eat or drink
anything that tasted metallic or otherwise odd?

09:11.400 --> 09:14.900
Oh, come on. Are you
thinking that I'm poisoned?

09:15.100 --> 09:19.300
- Did the doctor take your blood?
- Yes. And it checked out.

09:19.300 --> 09:24.200
- Well, if you were poisoned, it could have been overlooked.
- If it did, why call and tell me at the hospital?

09:24.200 --> 09:28.200
To scare you.
See what you'd do. Who you'd turn to.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.400
Oh. This is about you.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.500
Or about the X-Files.

09:33.500 --> 09:38.200
You are so paranoid, Mulder.
You're not even on the X-Files anymore.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.800
I know. But you are.
You still supervise them.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.500
What happened today?
Anything out of the ordinary?

09:45.500 --> 09:47.400
I'm not going to play this game.

09:47.400 --> 09:52.200
Look, it could've been anything. It could
have been the slightest touch, or a handshake.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.700
- This morning, you woke up...
- I woke up.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.100
Alone?

09:57.100 --> 09:59.200
Yes. Alone.

09:59.200 --> 10:03.000
- And how'd you get to the office?
- The same way that I always do-- I drove.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.100
- And then what?
- Then nothing-- I had meetings, I went to the gym, ...

10:06.100 --> 10:09.100
- ...to the hospital, and now I'm here.
- Just slow down.

10:09.100 --> 10:13.600
One step at a time. How'd you get
from the parking garage to your office?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.300
The elevator.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.700
And then what?

10:18.300 --> 10:24.100
I walked up the hallway. I passed the
same dozen people that I pass every morning.

10:25.900 --> 10:31.900
I went to my office. I said
"good morning" to my secretary.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.000
She said "good morning" to me.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.500
I returned calls, I did paperwork,
I was here for the rest of the day.

10:38.500 --> 10:43.000
Now think. There's
got to be something.

10:50.700 --> 10:54.200
In the hallway, there was a man.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.700
He stopped me.
He wanted to know the time.

10:59.900 --> 11:02.500
Did he touch you?

11:06.400 --> 11:09.300
He grabbed me.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.400
On my right wrist.

11:11.400 --> 11:17.000
It wouldn't necessarily leave a mark.
Some poisons are absorbed through the skin.

11:18.100 --> 11:21.100
What time was it?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.600
There you are.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.500
That's him. Right there.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.700
Wait a second. Back up.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.000
It can't be.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.600
That's Kenneth Orgel.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.000
An advisor to a Senate
subcommittee on ethics and new technology.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.900
- He's a scientist?
- A physicist. Very well known, as far as physicists go.

11:50.900 --> 11:55.200
He signed in here as a visitor to the
office of Assistant Director Walter Skinner.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.000
Why would he be coming to see you?

11:58.000 --> 12:03.400
- I'd like to ask him that myself.
- Sir, if this man poisoned you, you should be
off your feet and under a doctor's care.

12:03.400 --> 12:09.400
If this man poisoned me I'm going to put a
gun to his head, find out why and ask
him how he's going to make me well.

12:09.500 --> 12:13.200
- What hospital was he at?
- St. Katherine's.

12:34.100 --> 12:37.800
- Yes?
- Dr. Orgel? Kenneth Orgel?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.500
Yes.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.600
Do you know who I am?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.600
No.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.400
My name's Walter Skinner.
I'm an Assistant Director at the FBI.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.400
Dr. Orgel, you visited the FBI this morning.
You came to see Mr. Skinner.

12:51.400 --> 12:58.900
No... uh, you must be mistaken.
Sorry, you'll have to come back another time.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.600
- Go around back.
- What?

13:14.500 --> 13:17.300
Please, you're bothering me.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.100
Federal agent!

13:40.200 --> 13:41.700
Go!

14:10.300 --> 14:12.200
Drop the gun.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.200
Drop it!

14:54.900 --> 14:58.900
- Don't push me, beautiful!
- Yeah, so's your Mom.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.600
- Take your hands off me!
- Hey, give it a rest, huh?!

15:02.600 --> 15:09.900
You are such pigs! Pigs should eat you!
No, you should die like pigs!

15:13.300 --> 15:15.500
- Let him go, Agent Mulder.
- What?

15:15.500 --> 15:21.900
He's got diplomatic papers. It's our mistake.
You can go. Just let him go.

15:26.400 --> 15:31.400
Get in the house. The police are going to be
here any moment. I don't have time to
stand around and answer any questions.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.600
His name is Alexander Lazreg-- L-a-z-r-e-g.

15:34.600 --> 15:39.700
He's the cultural attache with the Tunisian mission
here in D.C. See what else you can find out about him.

15:39.700 --> 15:44.600
- You need to get to a hospital.
- No. I'm trying to stay out of one.

15:51.500 --> 15:55.700
20 HOURS, 29 MINUTES REMAINING
- The boxer, FBI.
- Yes, you released him from your care earlier this evening.

15:55.700 --> 16:00.600
- Is he not all right?
- Well, that's why I'm here. He may have been poisoned.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.300
You're kidding. By who?

16:03.300 --> 16:07.400
I don't know. In fact, I'm not
even sure what I'm looking for.

16:07.400 --> 16:13.600
Well, you're lucky. He's on a government HMO.
No one's even bothered to handle his samples yet.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.200
Is this them in here?

16:16.200 --> 16:22.200
I'm not supposed to let you have those,
not without a written release from the patient.

16:22.200 --> 16:27.100
We may not have time.
He may not have time either.

16:27.300 --> 16:30.800
He had absolutely no symptoms of poisoning.

16:30.800 --> 16:37.500
- Are you sure these haven't been processed?
- I'm not sure, but I doubt they've even been touched.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.900
I'm not so sure you should be doing that.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.200
This is a crime scene.
What would you rather I be doing?

17:03.200 --> 17:08.000
I'm concerned for Dr. Orgel's personal
property and the preservation of evidence.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.599
I'd be a lot more concerned
with the preservation of Dr. Orgel.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.599
Hello, Senator...

17:37.500 --> 17:40.500
It's carbon.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.200
Pure carbon.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.300
How in the world would that
get into his bloodstream?

17:47.300 --> 17:50.200
How is it working as a poison?

17:50.200 --> 17:53.400
By all rights, it shouldn't be.

18:01.600 --> 18:07.000
- Look at them, just rattling around in the solution.
- It's just bizarre.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.300
- Did you see that?
- Did you just touch something?

18:11.300 --> 18:13.900
No, I didn't.

18:13.900 --> 18:17.800
It just multiplied.
Look!

18:18.500 --> 18:20.700
It just did it again.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.900
Zooming in.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.200
What the hell are they?

18:45.100 --> 18:47.600
Wait here, please.

19:06.400 --> 19:11.500
I don't have to tell you how
late it is, do I, Agent Mulder?

19:11.500 --> 19:14.700
But I suspect that wasn't
even a consideration of yours.

19:14.700 --> 19:18.700
Actually, time is my only
consideration, Senator.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.800
This was taken only three days ago.

19:20.800 --> 19:27.300
It's of you and Dr. Kenneth Orgel holding
a Senate Resolution: S.R. 819, I think
it's called. What is that?

19:27.300 --> 19:30.500
A funding bill.
What is this all about?

19:30.500 --> 19:37.300
A friend of mine is going to die because of S.R. 819.
I don't know how, I don't even know why...

19:37.300 --> 19:39.800
- ...but I'm betting you do.
- What are you talking about?

19:39.800 --> 19:43.800
I don't even really know yet; all I have
are a few pieces: a Tunisian diplomat, ...

19:43.800 --> 19:47.600
...this Dr. Kenneth Orgel,
this health bill, S.R. 819.

19:47.600 --> 19:51.900
All leading up to a plot to kill an Assistant
Director of the FBI. Does that make sense?

19:51.900 --> 19:57.800
The bill you've referred to will provide money
and supplies to the World Health Organization, ...

19:57.800 --> 20:02.100
...medical technology to third world countries.

20:02.100 --> 20:09.200
I have aided you in the past with information, Fox,
and advice, which right now is to leave here at once...

20:09.200 --> 20:15.400
...and never again suggest to anyone
my involvement in any such dark intrigue.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.300
- Am I understood?
- This man may die; he may only have a few hours to live.

20:19.300 --> 20:24.200
My intention is to save lives, Fox, ...

20:24.200 --> 20:27.700
...but I can't save his.

20:28.700 --> 20:32.200
Good night, Fox.
Drive safely.

23:22.300 --> 23:25.500
15 HOURS, 21 MINUTES REMAINING

23:28.600 --> 23:30.900
Dr. Plant?

23:30.900 --> 23:33.200
- What? What is it?
- I think I've found it.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.200
I think I found what the carbon's doing.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.100
It's, uh...it's not just
reproducing itself. It has behavior.

23:41.100 --> 23:46.800
It's creating something, a-a matrix stimulated
by blood flow in response to movement.

23:46.800 --> 23:52.200
It's multiplying and solidifying
in an orderly fashion.

23:52.200 --> 23:56.100
It's building valves or-or
dams in the vascular system.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.900
It's building a heart attack.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.900
Dr. Plant?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.100
- You're doing blood work on a Walter Skinner?
- Yes.

24:03.100 --> 24:08.000
I just heard on the radio there's a
Walter Skinner who's been picked up
by paramedics at a parking garage downtown.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
- Where are they taking him?
- D.C. General.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.100
Did you see this?

24:18.100 --> 24:22.100
We've got some sort of
extreme vascular event here.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.600
- How is he even still alive?
- We'll take the left arm first.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.700
Mark it just above the bicep.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.600
Let's get to it.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.400
I'll get this side.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.400
Hey, you... Out.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.700
- I know this man.
- I don't care. This is a sterile operating room.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.700
- Get these people out.
- Look, I'm sorry. His name is Walter Skinner.

24:50.700 --> 24:53.300
We've been investigating his illness.
What are you doing?

24:53.300 --> 24:57.500
- If he's gonna live, he's gonna have to lose his arms.
- No, that's not going to save him. It's his blood.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.100
- Who the hell is this woman?
- She's a doctor.

25:00.100 --> 25:03.300
You're not going to solve anything
until you get a scope into him.

25:03.300 --> 25:06.200
Nothing else is going to work.

25:06.200 --> 25:10.200
Look, if you want to save this
man listen to what I'm saying.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.400
It's okay, sir.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.700
Lie back down.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.800
We're just moving
you to another room.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.600
Who did this to me?

25:34.600 --> 25:37.600
That's what Mulder's trying
to figure out right now.

25:37.600 --> 25:41.500
But we're going to take
good care of you. I promise.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.300
We're going to do everything we can.

25:54.100 --> 25:57.500
I don't know.
I can't remember.

26:18.700 --> 26:22.700
Sir?
Is that you?

26:25.000 --> 26:28.400
- Agent Mulder!
- Hey, do you have the key to this drawer?

26:28.400 --> 26:32.000
- What are you doing?
- AD Skinner's in the hospital. Somebody poisoned him.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
- Poisoned him? Why?
- For doing his job.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.300
I-I don't understand.

26:36.300 --> 26:42.200
I'm looking for anything that relates to a
Senate Resolution: S.R. 819. If you want to save
his life, you'll help me open this drawer.

26:42.200 --> 26:47.400
- I don't have the key.
- You have a letter opener? In your desk? Something?

26:50.700 --> 26:53.200
Is he going to be all right?

27:17.500 --> 27:20.700
- What's his condition?
- He's stable, but it's not good, Mulder.

27:20.700 --> 27:27.500
He's got extreme vascular trauma and distension.
His... his blood has become a weapon against his body.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.100
- Well, can you fight it?
- We don't know what it is.

27:30.100 --> 27:34.200
I mean, the best that we can do is
keep lasering his arteries open.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.000
But it's only going to be a
matter of time before we lose.

27:38.000 --> 27:44.200
I mean, it's-it's building walls in his vessels
faster than we can tear them down, and...

27:44.200 --> 27:48.800
- ...and we just don't have the technology to combat it.
- Maybe we do.

27:48.800 --> 27:53.100
- What is this?
- I found this with Skinner's morning mail.

27:53.300 --> 27:59.400
He was doing a security check on a Senate bill for
violation of trade laws involving sensitive technology.

27:59.400 --> 28:03.600
Yeah, but this is just a routine procedure, Mulder.
The FBI does dozens of these a year.

28:03.600 --> 28:11.000
No. This bill was going to vote in the Senate.
All it was waiting on was Skinner's review
and an analysis by Dr. Kenneth Orgel.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.100
You're saying that Dr. Orgel poisoned
Skinner in order to cover up his analysis?

28:15.100 --> 28:16.800
No. Orgel didn't poison anybody.

28:16.800 --> 28:25.400
Orgel came to the FBI to tell Skinner what he
knew, that there was a gross violation of
export laws involving new technology.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.600
New technology.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.600
You know what that means?

28:31.300 --> 28:34.300
Well, I think I might.

28:35.300 --> 28:37.400
That's not me.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.800
- You want to get this? It was in his pants pocket.
- Thank you.

28:41.700 --> 28:46.000
- Hello.
- Might as well... give up.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.600
- Who is it?
- It's a computer synth voice.

28:48.600 --> 28:52.700
You... can't... stop it.

28:52.700 --> 28:58.600
- Somebody that must know he's here.
- Walter Skinner... your time...

28:58.600 --> 29:01.400
...IS ALMOST UP.

29:18.700 --> 29:21.700
Federal agent!
Stop right there!

29:23.000 --> 29:24.500
Sir!

31:07.600 --> 31:13.100
- Yes.
- The bill is in danger, Senator. A new threat has emerged.

31:13.100 --> 31:16.900
- You shouldn't have called me.
- Blood will be on your hands.

31:16.900 --> 31:23.000
- I don't buy your hollow threats.
- Well, Dr. Orgel does. You can ask him.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.100
What have you done with him?

31:27.900 --> 31:30.900
I can tell you where to find him.

31:34.600 --> 31:39.100
The car is leased, part of a fleet service
that services the diplomatic counsel corps.

31:39.100 --> 31:42.700
- What other forensic evidence were you able to lift?
- Not much on the outside.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.700
It's not surprising considering
the condition of the vehicle.

31:45.700 --> 31:50.900
Inside we found a couple hairs,
human, from an expensive wig.

31:53.800 --> 31:57.000
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful.
What else?

31:57.000 --> 32:00.900
Well, we scraped the tire treads,
found something odd.

32:01.200 --> 32:05.800
It's full of polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs.
Over 500 parts per million.

32:05.800 --> 32:11.000
Now that's the kind of levels you used to see
in the 1970s. Right before the EPA got fangs.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.100
- From where?
- Well, the PCBs are saturated evenly in the clay, uh...

32:16.600 --> 32:21.000
Demo site, maybe, or, uh, an old power plant.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.800
Who's in here?

33:45.400 --> 33:48.200
Is someone there?

33:50.400 --> 33:55.000
Oh... Senator, please, let me go.

33:55.600 --> 33:59.600
I need... water.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.100
Who did this to you?

34:02.100 --> 34:06.600
Hurry... please.
It's... killing me.

34:06.600 --> 34:10.000
They believe you have exposed
them to the FBI, to Walter Skinner.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.699
No. I told the FBI nothing. I told them nothing.
Please, I promise not to expose anyone.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.199
3 HOURS, 56 MINUTES REMANING

35:00.300 --> 35:03.600
Sir, there's something I'd like to try.

35:03.600 --> 35:07.400
It's a treatment called
therapeutic plasmapheresis.

35:07.400 --> 35:11.100
It requires filtering all
of the blood in your body.

35:11.100 --> 35:17.400
It's a radical procedure and there is a
danger that your body might go into shock.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
I'm in your hands.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.100
I think I owe you an apology, Scully.

35:30.900 --> 35:33.100
You and Mulder.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.100
Sir?

35:35.100 --> 35:38.600
I've been lying here thinking.

35:40.600 --> 35:44.500
Your quest...

35:44.500 --> 35:48.800
- ...it should have been mine.
- What do you mean?

35:51.300 --> 35:56.200
If I die now, I die in vain.

35:57.900 --> 36:01.900
I have nothing to show for myself.

36:02.700 --> 36:04.800
My life...

36:04.800 --> 36:07.400
Sir, you know that's not true.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.200
It is.

36:13.200 --> 36:19.400
I can see now that... I always played it safe.

36:19.400 --> 36:23.300
I wouldn't take sides.

36:23.300 --> 36:27.100
Wouldn't let you and Mulder...

36:27.100 --> 36:30.400
...pull me in.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.400
You've been our ally
more times than I can say.

36:38.800 --> 36:42.900
Not the kind of ally that I could have been.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.400
- I remember now.
- What?

37:06.100 --> 37:10.400
- I can't see his face, he has a beard.
- Try.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.200
He was at the gym.

37:19.900 --> 37:22.600
At the hospital.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.500
He killed that man.

37:28.700 --> 37:32.800
He was at the FBI when Orgel approached me.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.800
He was following you?

37:36.000 --> 37:40.800
The tape... he's on the surveillance tape.

38:42.200 --> 38:46.400
You must be surprised to see me here.

38:52.800 --> 38:58.500
- I'm sure I'm not the man you're looking for.
- Where is he? Where's Orgel?

38:58.500 --> 39:01.300
- Orgel is dead.
- I don't believe you.

39:01.300 --> 39:04.000
You lied to me this morning;
you're lying to me now.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.200
- Drop this, Fox.
- Where is Orgel?!

39:06.200 --> 39:10.500
I need to know what he knows.
A friend of mine is dying.

39:10.500 --> 39:14.900
I tell you, they killed him.
What Orgel knows died with him.

39:14.900 --> 39:17.200
Tell me what you know, Senator!

39:17.200 --> 39:21.200
This is about S.R. 819, isn't it?
What the hell did they put in Skinner?

39:21.200 --> 39:26.300
I'm sure you already have some idea, Fox.

39:28.300 --> 39:31.700
It's the same technology
that S.R. 819 will export.

39:31.700 --> 39:36.700
Technology that the world
believes is purely theoretical.

39:36.700 --> 39:42.400
Nanotechnology.
Microscopic, atom-sized machines?

39:43.700 --> 39:47.300
- Machines can be stopped.
- Your friend is already dead.

39:47.300 --> 39:51.100
- I don't believe that.
- If you pursue this, Fox, they will kill you.

39:51.100 --> 39:57.100
- Not before I expose you and your role in this.
- My role? I am a victim here.

39:57.100 --> 40:00.200
Don't you understand that?
I'm fighting for my life.

40:00.200 --> 40:04.100
- I will stop this!
- It's too late, Fox.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.000
It's too late!

40:20.800 --> 40:22.900
All right, he's coding on us.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.500
Clear.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.600
Dr. Cabrera, clear.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.100
Dr. Cabrera?

40:32.200 --> 40:34.400
Let him go.

40:39.300 --> 40:43.000
Call time of death, 9:33.

41:40.200 --> 41:43.000
THREE WEEKS LATER

41:43.400 --> 41:48.100
Sir, I've spoken with your doctors
and your prognosis is excellent.

41:48.100 --> 41:51.200
Whatever you are infected
with appears to be dormant...

41:51.200 --> 41:55.000
...and your recovery is
being hailed as miracle.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.400
The man who poisoned you
was at the FBI that day.

41:58.400 --> 42:03.200
Scully was able to pull these
off the security video tapes.

42:03.200 --> 42:08.700
Hopefully, it might jog your memory.
Maybe you can identify this man.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.800
No, I'm sorry.

42:15.200 --> 42:19.100
S.R. 819 was withdrawn by
committee late last night.

42:19.100 --> 42:21.700
Without explanation.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.700
Good. So this man failed then?

42:24.700 --> 42:27.700
If that was his true motive.

42:27.700 --> 42:34.700
If he wanted to poison you to prevent you from
investigating S.R. 819, why call you to tell you that?

42:34.900 --> 42:42.900
This man worked for the government that was
to receive this technology. He drove one of their
cars and he killed one of his own to save you.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.700
So you still think this is about you?

42:46.700 --> 42:48.200
About the X-Files?

42:48.200 --> 42:49.900
Yes.

42:49.900 --> 42:56.600
Yes, I do. And I have an idea who may be behind all this.
But I'd need your authority to continue the investigation.

43:01.400 --> 43:07.900
I have neither the authority nor the will to
allow your continued inquiry into this matter.

43:08.800 --> 43:12.700
You'll perform your duties as directed
by AD Kersh and only AD Kersh.

43:12.700 --> 43:14.400
Sir?

43:14.600 --> 43:18.800
This matter's closed, Agents.
Am I clear?

43:58.100 --> 44:01.900
I've been expecting you to show up.

44:06.200 --> 44:09.300
You know I can push the button any time.

44:09.300 --> 44:13.900
What do you want from me?
What's this about, Krycek?

44:16.400 --> 44:19.700
All in good time.
