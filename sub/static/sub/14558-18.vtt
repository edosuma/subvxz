WEBVTT

00:12.480 --> 00:15.083
CHARLIE:
So, yeah, uh, remember that

00:15.116 --> 00:18.119
the fluid dynamics class
has been moved this week

00:18.152 --> 00:19.553
to Friday at 10:00.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.555
So, it's not at
its normal time.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.191
Okay, see you then.
Bye-bye.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.103
Charlie.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.270
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.338
I didn't mean to startle you.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.607
- Rachel?
- Yeah. Hi, Charlie.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.575
What-What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be

00:41.609 --> 00:43.077
doing that
Geospatial project

00:43.111 --> 00:44.245
- over at Stanford?
- No, I...

00:44.278 --> 00:45.346
This is a list of names

00:45.379 --> 00:46.580
of people I know,

00:46.614 --> 00:48.282
that I've worked
with recently.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.118
Three of them are now dead.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.385
- Did you say dead?
- Yeah.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.620
I think they found out something

00:52.653 --> 00:53.787
they weren't supposed to know.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.223
They were killed,

00:55.256 --> 00:56.257
even though it doesn't
look like it.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.726
And I think they're going
to kill me as well.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.162
How did they die, Rachel?

01:01.195 --> 01:03.364
It's complicated.
Look, I can't...

01:03.397 --> 01:05.599
I can't explain it right here.
Not... not now.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.335
Have you gone to the police?

01:07.368 --> 01:08.169
No, no, no, I can't trust them.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.670
But you can trust me?

01:09.703 --> 01:11.172
I know you.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.173
I know

01:12.206 --> 01:13.207
you're who you say you are.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.642
If you take me to your brother,

01:14.675 --> 01:15.776
I'll believe he's your brother.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.181
All right.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.616
I'll take you to see
my brother Don,

01:22.650 --> 01:24.718
tomorrow, at the FBI.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.786
Thank you.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.288
I'll meet you here
in the morning.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.689
And I'll bring documentation,
just, please,

01:28.722 --> 01:30.258
look at those names.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.225
They shouldn't
be dead,

01:31.259 --> 01:32.426
but they are.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.729
Rachel...

01:38.499 --> 01:40.801
A conspiracy, huh?

01:40.834 --> 01:41.935
I guess so, I mean,

01:41.969 --> 01:44.205
with this woman Rachel Lawton,
it's always something,

01:44.238 --> 01:45.573
- you know?
- Wacky, is she?

01:45.606 --> 01:46.574
Uh, maybe a little yeah.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.742
She was into these odd
ideas in grad school.

01:48.776 --> 01:49.710
Like for instance, uh,

01:49.743 --> 01:52.580
she once posed
that certain top scientists

01:52.613 --> 01:55.416
were actually aliens sent here
to help mankind.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.617
She probably knew Larry.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.286
That's the thing
about Rachel,

01:58.319 --> 01:59.387
she was always quite
a brilliant thinker

01:59.420 --> 02:01.922
and she was usually
a lot of fun to hang out with.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.324
So, uh, what's her field?

02:03.357 --> 02:05.393
She's a statistician--
specializing

02:05.426 --> 02:07.461
- in demography.
- Oh.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.663
There are some crazy
conspiracies, you know.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.166
Sometimes it takes
a brilliant,

02:12.200 --> 02:13.834
nutty thinker
to spot one.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.369
The only trouble is,

02:15.403 --> 02:17.271
usually the kind of people
nobody believes.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.543
MAN: Subject suffered
a cardiac arrest.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.813
A result of a massive
absorption of acetaminophen,

02:25.846 --> 02:28.316
hydrocodone
and alcohol.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.185
My preliminary finding
is Rachel Lawton died

02:31.219 --> 02:34.455
of a non-accidental overdose
of prescription medication.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.690
Hey, thanks very much.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.326
All right?

02:38.359 --> 02:43.531
She was scared, upset,
and maybe a little erratic,

02:43.564 --> 02:47.835
but, uh, she didn't
seem suicidal.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.737
Look, I got a quick
background here.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.372
I mean, you know,
she was going

02:51.405 --> 02:52.440
to a therapist
for two years.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.607
For what?

02:53.641 --> 02:55.343
For depression.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.777
The employment records
show she,

02:56.810 --> 02:58.846
she had emotional
outbursts,

02:58.879 --> 03:00.848
questionable stability,
you know...

03:00.881 --> 03:03.584
So, that's,
that's the end of it then?

03:03.617 --> 03:05.919
No, I mean, we'll do
a basic follow-up,

03:05.953 --> 03:08.689
but, I mean, I don't think
it's going anywhere.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.426
Come on, let's get
out of here.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.816
OSWALD:
Hey, Charlie.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.951
Oswald.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.254
Thanks for stopping by.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.290
I mean, don't thank me yet.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.458
I figured you wanted
to talk to me more

03:44.492 --> 03:46.327
about enrolling or whatever.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.295
Yeah.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.397
Specialized program.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.632
For people like you.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.034
High school dropouts that are
obsessed with fantasy baseball?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.403
Gifted people

03:55.436 --> 03:58.772
who lack traditional educations.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.008
Ah. That's a nice way
of putting it.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.476
But, Charlie,

04:02.510 --> 04:04.345
I'm just not a Cal Sci guy.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.913
I'm horrible at tests.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.315
Like, the worst.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.383
I can't talk to professors.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.385
- You talk to me.
- Yeah,

04:11.419 --> 04:13.321
but we met over
baseball stats.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.922
That's the one thing I know.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.457
Oswald,

04:16.490 --> 04:18.326
with some training,
man, you,

04:18.359 --> 04:21.595
you really could work
in any field you wanted to.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.632
What is this?
Ten million to one?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.367
It's the odds
of a woman

04:26.400 --> 04:27.535
and three people she worked with

04:27.568 --> 04:28.669
dying in a two week period.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.504
I knew her.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.040
I identified her body
this morning at the morgue.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.408
Oh, Charlie,

04:34.442 --> 04:35.709
that's awful.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.311
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

04:37.345 --> 04:40.013
She claimed that
these people were killed

04:40.047 --> 04:42.516
because of something
they knew.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.585
What about this guy
that's not checked off?

04:44.618 --> 04:46.720
Still alive, I guess.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.862
RECEPTIONIST: Berkeley Political
Science Department.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.063
Hello. Uh...

04:56.096 --> 04:58.932
I'm trying to reach
Dr. Robert Reynolds.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.100
- I, um...
- I'm sorry.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.470
Dr. Reynolds is no longer
with us.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.405
Are you a friend
or a family member?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.041
That's okay. Thank you.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.114
Charlie, what are the odds that
these five people would die

05:14.147 --> 05:15.082
in a two week period?

05:15.115 --> 05:17.818
About 700 million to one.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.621
Which means Rachel was
telling me the truth.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.625
DON:
So five people

05:24.658 --> 05:26.794
all mid-20s to 40s,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.362
all in good health,

05:28.396 --> 05:29.930
and all dead within two weeks.

05:29.963 --> 05:30.998
David.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.099
Teresa King,

05:32.132 --> 05:33.066
computer scientist.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.836
Rebecca Ortega, Sam Chambers
statisticians.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.004
And Robert Reynolds,

05:37.037 --> 05:38.506
political scientist.

05:38.539 --> 05:39.807
No known
connections.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.074
Heart attack,
asthma--

05:41.108 --> 05:42.510
conditions that can be
mimicked by drugs.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.378
DAVID: Yeah, we also have the
classics here.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.446
Slipped in the bathtub,

05:45.479 --> 05:48.115
car accident, self-
administered drug overdose.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.683
What about doing a second
autopsy on Rachel Lawton?

05:49.717 --> 05:51.452
Yeah, we already requested it.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.487
COLBY: And if Charlie's wrong,

05:53.521 --> 05:54.488
and these are five
random deaths?

05:54.522 --> 05:56.457
Well, that's why we got to find
something solid.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.058
Otherwise, I mean,
you know, I don't want

05:58.091 --> 05:59.059
to waste
our time here.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.597
Hey...

06:03.631 --> 06:04.932
am I losing you?

06:04.965 --> 06:06.934
Pardon?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.970
Some memo from DC
about a special detachment

06:10.003 --> 06:11.171
to the D.O.J.?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.541
No, uh...

06:13.574 --> 06:16.810
they called and I said
it probably isn't for me.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.446
Probably...

06:18.479 --> 06:19.647
Isn't.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.115
Okay.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.822
Hey, I found some more
journals with articles

06:28.856 --> 06:30.123
- by Rachel Lawton.
- Oh, thank you.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.091
Yeah.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.926
Any idea what she's
currently working on?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.528
No, not yet.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.798
She published a lot,
on a variety of topics.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.733
You know, she,
she came to a seminar

06:39.767 --> 06:40.968
that I taught in San Diego.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.069
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.438
She was a bright girl,
you know, creative thinker.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.474
It's just a shame.
You know, it's just a shame.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.642
Who kills a statistician?

06:48.676 --> 06:50.478
You know, one of our stats guys
got a death threat once.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.512
Yeah.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.713
For doing expert testimony

06:52.746 --> 06:53.781
in a water rights case.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.148
Isn't that
what got your

06:55.182 --> 06:57.918
special admissions candidate guy
into trouble--

06:57.951 --> 06:59.219
baseball stats, huh?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.054
Yeah.

07:01.088 --> 07:04.725
Actually he may not
be applying.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.093
Hmm?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.861
He's scared that he may not
be able to handle it.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.998
Well, we've all been there, huh?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.700
Except for maybe you.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.569
You know, when we have students
who lack confidence,

07:15.603 --> 07:17.771
sometimes we get
them interested

07:17.805 --> 07:19.873
in a really good problem.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.041
You know, just get
them obsessed,

07:21.074 --> 07:23.477
and then they forget

07:23.511 --> 07:25.012
- that they're afraid.
- Hmm.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.580
- Like what's this guy into?
- Girls.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.181
Skateboarding.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.750
Baseball.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.620
Statistics.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.222
(fast, hip-hop music plays)

07:51.605 --> 07:53.741
CHARLIE:
You know,

07:53.774 --> 07:56.209
you just broke the law
with that little trick.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.712
The law of conservation
of angular momentum.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.180
Ah. Wait, is that

08:00.213 --> 08:02.850
Sir Isaac Newton going
to come and bust me?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.552
Charlie,
you're not gonna

08:04.585 --> 08:06.620
hard sell me on this
college thing, are you?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.188
No. Actually, I, uh...

08:08.221 --> 08:09.590
I kind of need your help.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.294
We searched the hotel room
where Rachel Lawton died,

08:14.327 --> 08:15.262
but we didn't find any

08:15.295 --> 08:17.531
of the documentation
she told Charlie about.

08:17.565 --> 08:20.901
Now we have to go through what
she had on her when she died.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.235
Well, that's everything, so...

08:22.269 --> 08:24.304
COLBY:
This is it, huh?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.139
Hey, man, check
the bag for pens.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.975
Pens? What for?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.077
You didn't get that memo
on corporate espionage?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.779
Yeah, they make pens
where they can put

08:31.812 --> 08:32.980
the flash drive on the inside.

08:36.984 --> 08:41.188
Well, what else can they put
flash drives in?

08:41.221 --> 08:43.323
Key chains,
rubber duckies.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.592
Rubber ducky flash drive?

08:44.625 --> 08:45.759
I want one of those.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.027
Yeah.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.528
How 'bout a watch?

08:52.165 --> 08:54.334
OSWALD: This is about
those five people

08:54.367 --> 08:55.302
that died, isn't it?

08:55.335 --> 08:57.337
Well, Oswald, they must
have known something

08:57.370 --> 08:59.172
and were killed to
keep it a secret.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.241
This problem's
becoming a bit dangerous.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.911
That being said, I have
already been shot at once.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.345
Oh, hey.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.114
Hey, Professor.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.616
- COLBY: Perfect timing.
- DAVID: Oswald.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.250
- Good to see you.
- Fellas.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.119
Um...

09:12.152 --> 09:14.054
maybe I should
step out.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.989
Uh, you know what?
If it's all right

09:16.023 --> 09:18.058
with the FBI,
I would love

09:18.091 --> 09:18.992
to utilize
Mr. Kittner's

09:19.026 --> 09:21.128
statistical analysis
skills on this case.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.562
Mr. Kittner?

09:23.330 --> 09:24.632
So what do
you guys got?

09:27.034 --> 09:28.335
You've got a watch.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.737
It's Rachel Lawton's.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.739
Ah, yeah, it's
a flash drive.

09:31.772 --> 09:32.806
Here.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.975
Yeah, you just open this

09:35.008 --> 09:37.110
and all you need is a USB cable.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.647
- USB.
- Perfect.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.283
Plug that in there.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.818
That plugs directly
into your computer.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.922
That I do know about.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.899
This is some sort of
statistical raw data,

09:58.932 --> 10:01.935
pertaining to what
I'm not exactly sure.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.904
Oswald.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.342
I have no idea
what those headings mean.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.712
This is going
to be tough.

10:11.745 --> 10:15.015
The best problems always are.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.886
DAVID:
One connection

10:18.919 --> 10:20.921
between Rachel Lawton and
the other dead people--

10:20.954 --> 10:23.356
they all worked in
statistical analysis.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.225
And statisticians
usually

10:25.258 --> 10:27.895
work freelance--
they go from project to project.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.697
Hired by corporations,
governments,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.198
political campaigns.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.667
I found a more specific
connection

10:33.701 --> 10:35.869
to three out of five of them.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.707
DAVID:
J. Everett Tuttle.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.507
The billionaire?

10:40.540 --> 10:42.342
Yeah, he's a hedge
fund manager,

10:42.375 --> 10:44.244
he's into philanthropy
and politics.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.813
Three of the people

10:45.846 --> 10:47.748
on Rachel's list worked
for one of his companies.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.016
That's not much.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.418
I mean, a financial wiz
hiring statisticians.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.485
"Not much" is all we have.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.923
I finished the forensic
autopsy on Rachel Lawton.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.691
It was smart to request
a second one.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.826
Why? What do you got?

10:58.859 --> 10:59.960
Apparently, her killer didn't
have a lot of patience.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.196
Although she had a potentially
lethal dose of alcohol

11:03.230 --> 11:06.700
and painkillers in her, Rachel
Lawton died of asphyxiation.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.168
How?

11:08.201 --> 11:09.703
She had traces of cotton fiber

11:09.737 --> 11:11.104
in her lungs, likely
suffocated from a pillow

11:11.138 --> 11:13.340
or towel after she
was unconscious.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.341
Sort of thing that,

11:14.374 --> 11:16.777
in the absence of
suspicious circumstances,

11:16.810 --> 11:18.145
might be missed.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.780
So we're not talking
about five random deaths.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.448
We've definitely have
one murder on our hands.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.450
We're gonna need forensic
autopsies on the other victims.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.953
I'll get it started.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.088
We might be
looking at five murders.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.322
Yeah.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.191
But we have no idea
what they're about.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.867
Five deaths, but so far you can
only prove one was murder.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.368
It's mathematically
improbable

11:41.401 --> 11:42.302
that these deaths
are coincidence.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.437
Well, to make a case,
we need a motive.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.806
And live witnesses.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.074
You say three of the dead

11:47.107 --> 11:49.109
did consulting work
for J. Everett Tuttle?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.278
Right, and what do you
know about him?

11:51.311 --> 11:53.413
Got a rep for playing dirty
on Wall Street.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.448
SEC made a run at
him, got nowhere.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.417
The New York AG
indicted him on fraud,

11:57.450 --> 11:59.519
but two of the witnesses
disappeared,

11:59.552 --> 12:01.188
- and couldn't make a case.
- Witnesses disappeared?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.890
One was later found
in Greece.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.325
The other never turned up.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.459
You think he's capable
of murder?

12:06.493 --> 12:09.396
They think so in New York,
but they had no evidence.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.231
The guys are off to see Tuttle,
let's see what

12:11.264 --> 12:12.299
they come up with,
all right?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.341
It's a great cardio workout.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.510
Great way to get
some firewood, too.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.278
Yeah.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.380
Well, you end up
with something useful.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.282
Sit on those exercise machines,

12:29.316 --> 12:30.350
you got nothing
when you're done.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.353
So, how can I
help the FBI?

12:33.386 --> 12:34.554
We're here to talk to you about

12:34.587 --> 12:36.123
three people who used
to work for you.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.926
Let's see.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.132
Well, Sam Chambers
did research for me.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.499
And, uh...

12:46.533 --> 12:48.869
I don't know the other two.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.137
They were
researchers as well.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.405
I hire a lot
of consultants.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.541
I don't meet them
all in person.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.443
Well, these three all died
within the last few weeks.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.946
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.180
What were they hired
to do for you?

13:00.213 --> 13:02.482
I'm not sure.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.117
Would you
check on that?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.452
I'll get
back to you.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.520
Mr. Tuttle, do you know
a Rachel Lawton?

13:07.554 --> 13:10.057
Doesn't sound familiar.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.092
What business
do you actually do?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.326
I retired
a year ago.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.395
Well...

13:15.428 --> 13:17.898
I manage a hedge fund.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.466
I serve on
corporate boards.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.601
Try to put more time into public
service, that sort of thing.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.436
And why do you employ

13:23.470 --> 13:26.139
statisticians
and computer scientists?

13:26.173 --> 13:28.141
To test stock market systems.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.011
See, I'm still
dreaming about finding

13:31.044 --> 13:33.914
that magic formula
for striking it rich.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.983
Some people would say
you've already found it.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.452
Take it from a guy
with more than enough,

13:39.486 --> 13:40.553
it ain't never enough.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.858
So, it looks like
this Oswald kid

13:44.892 --> 13:46.493
bit pretty hard
on the FBI hook, huh?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.328
Yeah, yeah, no,
he's really into it,

13:48.361 --> 13:50.063
but he still won't
apply to Cal Sci.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.331
What?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.633
He doesn't quite grasp all the
things he could accomplish here.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.569
And I just don't know how
to get that across to him.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.406
Well, that's because your
whole life is math and science,

13:59.439 --> 14:00.473
same with your students.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.542
I mean, what, you were
raised in the church here

14:02.575 --> 14:04.244
and you preach
to the converted.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.446
Just have
to figure out a way

14:06.479 --> 14:07.514
to convert the heathen.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.481
Yeah, well, here he comes.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.883
Oswald.

14:09.917 --> 14:10.951
Hey, Charlie.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.119
Speak of the devil.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.253
There's
something off

14:13.286 --> 14:14.254
about Rachel's numbers.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.255
- Hi there.
- Hi, hi.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.256
Go ahead.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.457
I did what you said.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.593
I printed them out without
headings to search for patterns.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.629
Didn't find
any patterns,

14:22.662 --> 14:24.397
but there's definitely
something off about her numbers.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.333
I just can't put my finger
on it, you know?

14:26.366 --> 14:27.567
Let us take
a look at it.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.568
Here you go.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.470
Thanks.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.572
You know what? That's a very
good observation, Oswald.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.042
Because there are
too many sevens.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.977
And threes.
Too many for what?

14:37.010 --> 14:38.345
Too many for this
list to be random.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.479
MILLIE:
Yeah.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.647
For some reason,
when people make up

14:40.680 --> 14:41.714
reports with numbers in them,

14:41.748 --> 14:44.684
they always put in way too
many threes and sevens

14:44.717 --> 14:46.019
and not enough ones and twos.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.556
Me, I think I'd use
too many fours.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.392
I mean, this way, you can not
know what the numbers describe,

14:52.425 --> 14:54.027
but you can tell
if someone's lying.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.195
Mm.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.564
And on that note,
I have to go to work.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.132
- Bye-bye, Millie.
- Nice to meet you.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.600
- You, too.
- Thank you.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.303
She was pleasant.
Who's that?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.038
That's Dr. Mildred Finch.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.540
She's the chair of our math,
physics and astronomy division.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.242
Really?

15:09.276 --> 15:11.044
She's easy to talk to.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.679
Yeah, she is, a little bit.

15:12.712 --> 15:16.249
So, anyway, how do we
figure out what this is?

15:16.283 --> 15:19.319
Well, we have applications
that can help analyze

15:19.352 --> 15:20.653
unlabeled sets of numbers.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.289
It's called
meta-data.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.424
It's information about data.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.658
For instance, the numbers

15:25.692 --> 15:27.594
one, two, three, four
and five are data.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.963
They may refer to anything.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.599
But let's say you found out
that they refer to a zip code.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.501
Well, then they mean
something specific--

15:34.534 --> 15:36.103
in this case,
Schenectady, New York.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.438
So we use that to figure out

15:38.471 --> 15:40.107
what Rachel's numbers
are talking about.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.609
Yeah, and then we may be able
to figure out why she died.

15:45.012 --> 15:48.115
If you want a spooky guy
to mastermind a conspiracy,

15:48.148 --> 15:49.482
J. Everett Tuttle
is your pick.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.551
Why do you say that?

15:51.584 --> 15:54.154
We told him that three of
his former employees died

15:54.187 --> 15:55.522
in the last couple of weeks,

15:55.555 --> 15:57.624
didn't seem to care,
didn't even ask how.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.027
No concern for them,
nothing for the families?

16:00.060 --> 16:02.329
Not at all. No, in fact, the
only time

16:02.362 --> 16:03.730
he expressed
any interest at all...

16:03.763 --> 16:04.597
Don't tell me.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.366
Was when you asked him
about himself.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.068
- Yeah. You got it right.
- All right,

16:08.101 --> 16:09.436
he could have a
self-absorbed,

16:09.469 --> 16:11.471
Type-A personality, or
he could be a sociopath.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.108
You got something new?

16:15.142 --> 16:16.143
I do.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.577
But I don't know
what it means yet.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.579
Four of the five dead people
have consulted

16:19.612 --> 16:21.181
on political campaigns.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.349
(typing)

16:22.382 --> 16:23.583
Mostly high-end
polling analysis.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.285
But...

16:25.318 --> 16:26.653
I'm still working
my magic on that.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.689
OSWALD:
Hey, Charlie,

16:29.722 --> 16:30.623
what about the lottery?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.060
Could we just be looking
at Lotto numbers?

16:33.093 --> 16:35.028
- I mean...
- Watch your head.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.763
- New category.
- Oh, great.

16:36.796 --> 16:40.467
Megan says that four
of the researchers

16:40.500 --> 16:42.769
consulted for
political campaigns.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.138
Oh, so you think
we're looking at, like,

16:45.172 --> 16:46.606
like, polling data

16:46.639 --> 16:49.042
or, uh, campaign contributions?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.610
Maybe votes.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.213
Lets see what happens

16:53.246 --> 16:55.648
when we compare Rachel's numbers
to election returns.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.486
ALAN:
Hey, Donnie.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.121
Do you ever think
of moving back home?

17:01.154 --> 17:02.589
Yeah, no thanks.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.657
Well, I mean, you're here
all the time lately.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.493
You know, there's
plenty of room.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.628
Yeah, look, I like having
somewhere else to go.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.364
You know, my own
little piece of privacy.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.800
I yearned for that once, too,
if you remember.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.635
I remember.

17:15.668 --> 17:19.172
Guess I thought
I'd miss you guys too much.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.074
(door opens)
Hey.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.344
So, Rachel's data
might be election results.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.246
We're gonna
compare it

17:26.279 --> 17:27.680
to local and state returns.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.615
ALAN:
It wasn't suicide,

17:28.648 --> 17:31.318
- it was a murder.
- Yeah, looks that way.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.686
This Rachel girl
you met at grad school,

17:33.720 --> 17:35.388
were you guys close?

17:35.422 --> 17:39.092
Yeah, a bunch of us used
to hang out-- she had a van.

17:39.126 --> 17:42.795
So we'd all pile in, we'd go
to movies, go to concerts or...

17:42.829 --> 17:44.697
It's funny--
she'd always say

17:44.731 --> 17:46.633
we could spend
our whole lives studying,

17:46.666 --> 17:49.269
but we'd only be young
for a short while.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.742
What are you... You're
not worried about

17:55.775 --> 17:57.177
how I'm handling this,
are you?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.778
Uh... yeah.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.714
To be honest,
I'm kind of concerned

18:01.748 --> 18:03.783
that it's not bothering me more.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.287
It's all this FBI stuff,
you know?

18:07.320 --> 18:08.788
After a couple dozen

18:08.821 --> 18:11.258
murder cases,

18:11.291 --> 18:14.194
just isn't hitting me
the same as it used to,

18:14.227 --> 18:16.196
even when I know the victim.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.398
And that's, um...

18:18.431 --> 18:19.899
that's an unsettling
realization.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.701
Yeah, tell me about it.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.503
Oh, so now I got

18:23.536 --> 18:25.772
two jaded, world-weary sons.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.740
Yeah. This one's got
a shrink to prove it.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.184
CHARLIE:
Hey.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.719
So I ran Rachel's data
against election returns,

18:39.752 --> 18:41.754
and this brute force
data search found a match.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.190
To an election here in L.A.?

18:44.191 --> 18:45.192
Yeah, to the most recent

18:45.225 --> 18:46.726
county supervisor's election.

18:46.759 --> 18:47.760
I think it's
the sixth district.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.196
Jason Brasher won,
beat a three-term incumbent.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.563
- Big upset.
- What, he stole it?

18:50.597 --> 18:51.798
CHARLIE:
Well, I'll tell you this:

18:51.831 --> 18:53.866
those vote totals
should be random,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.868
- and they aren't.
- All right,

18:55.902 --> 18:57.470
this is starting to make sense.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.739
J. Everett Tuttle was
Brasher's largest contributor.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.242
He was the driving force
behind the campaign.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.477
Rachel Lawton, she worked
on Brasher's campaign.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.878
Says that she did

19:05.912 --> 19:07.547
demographic analysis, Charlie.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.881
MEEKS: Teresa King
did freelance work

19:08.915 --> 19:10.383
for a computer company.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.751
That same company
had a contract

19:11.784 --> 19:12.852
with the Brasher campaign.

19:14.887 --> 19:15.755
That's all five victims.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.591
Oh, man, do we have
to ask, you know?

19:18.625 --> 19:21.194
The odds that this would be
random, it's like the four of us

19:21.228 --> 19:22.762
getting hit by lightning
on the way home tonight.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.231
And it's not
even raining.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.398
So, Tuttle...

19:25.432 --> 19:26.633
Yeah, I'm with you.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.767
Now, California
Elections Code

19:27.800 --> 19:29.369
requires an audit
of five percent

19:29.402 --> 19:30.337
of touch-screen
voting machines.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.440
And here it is.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.775
A preliminary audit
indicated discrepancies,

19:35.808 --> 19:38.411
but the final report
said the race was clean.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.880
The auditor changed his mind?

19:40.913 --> 19:42.449
We should talk to him,

19:42.482 --> 19:43.883
find out why.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.924
- That the house?
- That's the one.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.227
Hey, hold on.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.328
FBI. What
happened here?

19:55.362 --> 19:56.563
Guy who lives here,
looks like

19:56.596 --> 19:58.431
he slipped by the pool
and hit his head,

19:58.465 --> 19:59.566
fell in and drowned.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.300
Get everybody out.
It's a crime scene.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.869
Get everybody
out right now.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.771
Hey, everybody,
we got to clear out.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.612
Arman Cuthbert,

20:12.645 --> 20:14.447
auditor with
the County Registrar.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.715
There's no evidence
of foul play,

20:15.748 --> 20:17.384
but, I mean,
what do you think

20:17.417 --> 20:18.485
Charlie would say
about those odds?

20:18.518 --> 20:21.321
Why kill somebody over
a county supervisor's seat?

20:21.354 --> 20:23.323
L.A. County Supervisors
are powerful.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.492
Each reps over
two million people--

20:25.525 --> 20:26.893
more than
many U.S. Senators.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.361
They control a budget
worth billions.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.529
You think Tuttle

20:29.562 --> 20:30.563
rigged the election for Brasher?

20:30.597 --> 20:31.998
It's looking like it.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.634
The county's using these
new electronic voting machines.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.735
We'd better find out

20:35.768 --> 20:36.736
how secure they are.

20:36.769 --> 20:37.870
A political
conspiracy,

20:37.904 --> 20:39.506
complete with dead witnesses.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.441
We need a
live witness.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.242
If there's
any left.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.046
Doubt you're here
for my darts.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.481
Nope.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.017
But I am winning.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.720
Yeah, Charlie, we need your
help finding witnesses

20:53.753 --> 20:55.322
these guys haven't
gotten to yet.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.324
I'll certainly try--
using organizational theory.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.958
Because every
organization

20:58.991 --> 21:00.560
can be analyzed
mathematically.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.895
And in this case, there's
the extra added parameter

21:02.929 --> 21:03.730
of secrecy.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.332
So you could
mathematically analyze

21:05.365 --> 21:06.333
the JFK assassination?

21:06.366 --> 21:07.467
CHARLIE:
Oh, sure.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.937
Look, JFK conspiracy theories
require the cooperation

21:10.970 --> 21:12.305
of the CIA, the FBI.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.340
That number of

21:13.373 --> 21:14.173
people involved,
mathematically,

21:14.206 --> 21:17.009
makes keeping the secret
impractical.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.311
OSWALD:
Yeah, which is

21:18.345 --> 21:19.479
why we all know about it.

21:19.512 --> 21:22.382
But can your analysis
help us find

21:22.415 --> 21:23.716
the role of
any remaining witnesses?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.385
Here's what I'm gonna
do for you.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.320
I'm gonna look at the employees
at Brasher's campaign,

21:27.354 --> 21:30.323
as well as at
Tuttle's firm,

21:30.357 --> 21:32.425
and match them against
who you'd need to pull off

21:32.459 --> 21:33.993
an election fraud.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.428
I guess the FBI could do that.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.464
I can do it faster.

21:37.497 --> 21:41.334
Election irregularities?
I thought that got looked into.

21:41.368 --> 21:44.737
The county conducted an audit
of the election, am I right?

21:44.771 --> 21:45.805
Well, there you go.

21:45.838 --> 21:46.939
MEEKS:
Superintendent Brasher,

21:46.973 --> 21:47.974
what was your connection

21:48.007 --> 21:49.542
to J. Everett Tuttle?

21:49.576 --> 21:50.710
Everett is my
good friend.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.944
We go way back.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.380
He is the one
that talked me

21:53.413 --> 21:54.481
into running for public office.

21:54.514 --> 21:57.550
Everybody else said no way,
impossible, can't win.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.419
They sure look like idiots now.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.391
Sir, do you know this woman?

22:05.658 --> 22:07.126
Nope. No, never seen her.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.561
Cute girl.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.897
She worked for
your campaign.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.031
She was murdered.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.469
Uh...

22:16.503 --> 22:19.338
I... I don't even know what her
job was; never met the woman.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.377
What's this about?

22:24.411 --> 22:26.513
Are you saying that
there's some connection

22:26.546 --> 22:28.881
between this woman's death

22:28.915 --> 22:30.583
- and my campaign?
- Was there?

22:30.617 --> 22:32.419
What the hell...?

22:32.452 --> 22:34.821
No... This can't
be happening to me.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.156
I will talk to you
after I've gotten a lawyer.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.458
But before I do,

22:38.491 --> 22:39.626
I'm gonna
make some phone calls

22:39.659 --> 22:40.793
and find out what the hell

22:40.827 --> 22:42.529
you people
think you're doing.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.499
Wonder how much
Tuttle's told this guy.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.535
My guess... nothing.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.504
I know Tuttle's our guy,

22:51.538 --> 22:52.772
but I still don't know
how he did it.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.408
And we don't have any evidence
I can put in front of a judge.

22:55.442 --> 22:56.943
It's like prosecuting
the Mafia--

22:56.976 --> 22:58.478
everybody knows
something's going on,

22:58.511 --> 23:00.112
but nobody will
talk about it.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.681
We just need some time,
you know?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.616
I mean, how about you
pressuring him on Brasher?

23:03.650 --> 23:06.185
They might lay low, give us
time to find some witnesses.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.920
Worth a try.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.089
My company has met or surpassed

23:10.122 --> 23:11.858
every security requirement.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.560
Our machines create
a paper trail

23:13.593 --> 23:14.894
that can be audited.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.430
They're actually more
secure and easier to use

23:17.464 --> 23:19.031
than any paper ballot system.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.767
How's the software
actually protected?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.168
All machines

23:22.201 --> 23:24.537
are kept in a guarded facility
until an election.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.173
Access to the unit's
hard drive is locked.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.108
But poll workers can open it.

23:29.141 --> 23:30.877
Even if one machine was hacked,

23:30.910 --> 23:32.612
they don't link up.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.547
And there's no way
to dial into them.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.449
Mr. Dockins, you're confident

23:36.483 --> 23:38.217
that these machines
performed as intended

23:38.250 --> 23:39.251
during the recent
election cycle?

23:39.285 --> 23:41.020
What if I told you
the results were fraudulent?

23:41.053 --> 23:42.822
Whatever the problem was,

23:42.855 --> 23:44.857
it wasn't in these machines.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.796
CHARLIE: So I've identified two
job profiles necessary

23:49.829 --> 23:52.565
to the conspiracy that don't
match the dead people.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.966
Uh, what are we looking for?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.569
Okay, one would be
a demographer specializing

23:56.603 --> 23:59.506
in statistical analysis
of L.A. elections.

23:59.539 --> 24:03.142
Someone well experienced
with precinct data.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.877
- And the other one?
- A computer programmer

24:04.911 --> 24:08.548
someone exceptionally
innovative and smart.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.683
Probably makes a lot of money
and consults extensively.

24:13.252 --> 24:16.055
You have no evidence of any
wrongdoing on my client's part.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.490
MEEKS:
Mr. Tuttle is at the center

24:17.524 --> 24:19.258
of an intensive
federal investigation.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.961
I've been investigated
dozens of times.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.864
Resulting in
no convictions.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.533
We ain't talking about
stock fraud here, guys.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.667
We'll look at your
businesses, your contacts,

24:27.700 --> 24:29.001
your political
involvement,

24:29.035 --> 24:30.903
particularly
the Brasher campaign.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.639
And we're going to get into
everything, you understand

24:32.672 --> 24:34.106
- what I'm saying?
- Hmm.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.545
I own two
dozen companies,

24:38.578 --> 24:40.279
with numerous
subsidiaries,

24:40.312 --> 24:43.550
I serve on 15 boards
of directors

24:43.583 --> 24:45.251
and I employ

24:45.284 --> 24:47.654
four major law firms.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.689
Even a cursory

24:49.722 --> 24:51.791
investigation of my holdings

24:51.824 --> 24:55.695
is going to put quite a strain
on the FBI's limited resources.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.964
But...good luck, fellas.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.005
Oh, yeah, he's scared.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.540
So, you found some people

25:07.574 --> 25:09.742
that fit the profiles
we came up with?

25:09.776 --> 25:11.644
DAVID:
Actually, Megan found two.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.580
Austin Parker
and Jane Aliano.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.682
He was the head researcher
on Brasher's campaign.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.617
And she did software
security work

25:17.650 --> 25:19.786
on one of Tuttle's
stock management firms.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.821
Yeah, the kicker is
they're both missing.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.656
Why am I not surprised?

25:23.690 --> 25:24.857
Rachel Lawton's
phone records show

25:24.891 --> 25:26.258
that she called both of them

25:26.292 --> 25:27.860
day before she
was murdered.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.662
She must have
tried to warn them.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.698
Yeah, now Parker's still alive.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.332
We got four hits on his credit
card in the last two days.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.333
So, assuming he's
moving around,

25:34.366 --> 25:36.168
- hiding out.
- OSWALD: When I tried that...

25:36.202 --> 25:37.036
you guys found me.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.138
DAVID:
Yeah, he left his car at home.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.973
Could have borrowed one,
might be living in it.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.174
If he'd rented, we'd have found

25:42.208 --> 25:43.342
a record of
that by now.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.211
Yeah. All right,
we'll try to figure out

25:45.244 --> 25:46.312
what he's using for a car.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.581
I'll chart some rough ideas
on where they might be,

25:48.615 --> 25:50.817
based on those four
credit card hits.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.885
Using the theory that he's, uh,
avoiding his usual hangouts.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.887
So...

25:54.921 --> 25:57.990
I'm assuming that she's
our computer scientist.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.358
That's right.
She told her sister

25:59.391 --> 26:01.761
she was heading out of town,
expected back on Monday,

26:01.794 --> 26:04.063
but we haven't heard anything,
there's been no calls,

26:04.096 --> 26:06.165
no activity on the credit cards,
so, she might be dead.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.702
OSWALD:
Now, forgive me

26:09.736 --> 26:11.804
for stating the obvious,
but, uh...

26:11.838 --> 26:13.372
it seems Austin Parker

26:13.405 --> 26:15.942
is your last hope.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.161
Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

26:35.194 --> 26:36.763
What's going on?
What's going on?

26:36.796 --> 26:37.129
It's all right.

26:37.163 --> 26:37.830
We're FBI.

26:37.864 --> 26:38.931
We're here to protect you, okay?

26:38.965 --> 26:40.232
Hold on! Hold on!

26:40.266 --> 26:41.834
We know that Rachel Lawton
called you.

26:41.868 --> 26:44.671
She told you
what's going on.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.073
We also know that this is
about the Brasher election.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.341
Whatever life I have left

26:49.375 --> 26:51.678
has become about
the Brasher election.

26:51.711 --> 26:52.645
What was your involvement?

26:52.679 --> 26:54.914
I was asked to make up
a list of precincts

26:54.947 --> 26:56.282
where the vote
would be closest.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.851
- And that's what I did.
- Is that unusual?

26:58.885 --> 26:59.786
Winning precincts doesn't count.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.654
All that matters
is the overall vote total.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.922
But guess what?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.857
Brasher won all the precincts
on your list.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.694
Somebody used my list to decide
where to hack the vote.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.729
They figured it'd look
less suspicious if they did it

27:09.762 --> 27:11.363
in precincts where the votes
were closer. Yep.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.331
There was a mandatory audit,

27:12.364 --> 27:14.333
due to the use of electronic
voting machines.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.401
Now the auditor's dead.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.236
Mr. Parker, we'd like
you to come with us, okay?

27:17.269 --> 27:18.437
We need you to
make a statement.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.939
Wait, wait. You can't
make a case yet.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.040
Until you can,
I'm not cooperating.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.842
We have witness protection.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.944
These people rigged an election,
I think they can

27:24.977 --> 27:25.912
hack witness protection.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.450
Get some indictments,
then maybe I'll testify.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.952
All right. Who do you think
is behind this?

27:32.985 --> 27:35.087
Brasher's an idiot.

27:35.121 --> 27:38.090
But his old friend Tuttle--
he had a hand in everything.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.959
Okay, gentlemen,

27:39.992 --> 27:42.428
that's what I know.
Now get out of my car.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.395
Now, Mr. Parker,

27:43.429 --> 27:44.063
you're gonna be safer
if you come with us.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.031
None of us is safe. Get out.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.700
We'll find you again.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.869
- If I'm around to find.
- Get out.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.713
We need unmarked units
for surveillance

28:00.747 --> 28:05.451
on a vehicle
license 4-D-Q-S...

28:24.003 --> 28:26.072
- You okay?
- Yeah.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.407
I didn't think I'd be this
close to a car bomb again

28:28.440 --> 28:30.409
after Afghanistan,
but ,yeah, I'm fine.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.379
Could have been detonated
remotely.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.014
Might have been a timer.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.949
Could have been any one

28:36.983 --> 28:39.285
of about half a dozen different
fusing techniques.

28:42.521 --> 28:45.091
MEGAN: Well that's a change in
tactics.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.258
I mean, this is
an obvious murder.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.159
It's not a staged

28:47.193 --> 28:49.061
accident anymore.
We confronted Tuttle

28:49.095 --> 28:49.929
and he put it right
back in our faces.

28:49.962 --> 28:54.333
So it's gonna come down
to Jane Aliano.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.869
Agent Reeves, the Director's
Office is on line two.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.471
I'll call him back.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.439
Okay.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.043
What, you're ducking
calls from the Director?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.511
Only when I have to tell
him something

29:05.544 --> 29:07.079
he doesn't
want to hear.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.380
I'll take the Aliano interview.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.316
All right.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.324
I take care of Pico, Jane's dog,

29:18.357 --> 29:20.359
when she's out of town.

29:20.392 --> 29:23.029
Do you know what's
happened to my sister?

29:23.062 --> 29:25.197
No. But we're trying
to locate her.

29:25.231 --> 29:29.035
She does a lot of consulting--
travels all the time--

29:29.068 --> 29:32.939
but she's never just not
shown up like this.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.573
Is there any possibility
she might have spoken

29:34.606 --> 29:36.175
to another family member
or a friend?

29:36.208 --> 29:39.011
No. No, not that I've heard.

29:39.045 --> 29:42.114
And that's what's
really scaring me.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.916
She's never
gone this long without

29:43.950 --> 29:45.051
calling Mom and Dad.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.086
And how was she the last time
that you spoke to her?

29:47.119 --> 29:49.121
Distracted.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.590
But, but that's Jane-- one
of those brilliant people

29:51.623 --> 29:53.492
always processing
four things at once.

29:53.525 --> 29:56.295
(laughs):
I know the type.

29:56.328 --> 29:59.131
She wanted to be sure
I'd have time for Pico.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.567
feed him,
take him for a walk

30:01.600 --> 30:03.169
in his favorite park.

30:03.202 --> 30:06.138
I told her of course.
I know how much he means to her.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.574
She even made him
a Christmas stocking.

30:08.607 --> 30:11.077
This dog is like
a child to her.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.478
(whines)

30:27.059 --> 30:30.029
FBI.
Jane, it's okay.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.563
- We're the good guys.
- We have her.

30:31.597 --> 30:32.865
DISPATCH:
Roger that, Agent Sinclair.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.071
I got a call
from Rachel Lawton,

30:39.105 --> 30:40.506
and what she
said scared me.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.274
But even before
that, I knew

30:42.308 --> 30:44.276
something was hinky
about the whole thing.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.378
What you know could really
help us, Jane.

30:46.412 --> 30:49.548
Yeah, but then what
happens to me?

30:49.581 --> 30:51.117
Look, if we were
able to find you,

30:51.150 --> 30:52.251
it would've only been
a matter of time

30:52.284 --> 30:53.519
until they did, too.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.087
But we will

30:55.121 --> 30:57.023
protect you every step
of the way.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.424
And we need
a witness

30:58.457 --> 31:00.126
who's willing to take them down.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.330
I'm... I'm just
so damn scared.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.397
I know you are.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.967
But you're angry, too.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.141
They picked the wrong computer
geek to mess with.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.080
DON:
Come on, there just,

31:21.113 --> 31:23.082
there can't be
that many possibilities.

31:23.115 --> 31:26.118
In general, no, it's
power/control, power/wealth.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.920
Well, it all comes back
to money, doesn't it?

31:27.954 --> 31:29.088
People get money
to get power,

31:29.121 --> 31:30.689
or power to get money.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.159
There are fanatical
idealists, you know.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.261
He shoots,
he scores!

31:35.294 --> 31:37.596
Oh, Oswald Kittner.

31:37.629 --> 31:38.931
Mercy rule?

31:38.965 --> 31:40.366
It's got to be
a Canadian hockey table.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.700
If they can rig
a local election,

31:41.733 --> 31:42.935
why not a larger one?

31:42.969 --> 31:43.970
Uh, because the bigger election,

31:44.003 --> 31:45.104
the bigger the conspiracy.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.339
If it's too big, it can't
sustain secrecy, you know?

31:47.373 --> 31:48.474
It's like Watergate.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.242
It's like Iran-Contra
or something.

31:50.276 --> 31:52.979
Unless there's a self-
perpetuating element involved

31:53.012 --> 31:55.147
like, uh... nano technology.

31:55.181 --> 31:58.184
Okay, you know when you
stack up champagne glasses

31:58.217 --> 31:59.418
and fill them with champagne?

31:59.451 --> 32:02.221
You only pour the champagne
into the top glass

32:02.254 --> 32:04.123
and then it overflows
to the others.

32:04.156 --> 32:07.159
Requires resources applied in
one location, then it spreads.

32:07.193 --> 32:08.527
Oh, good God,
another one?

32:08.560 --> 32:09.595
(chuckles)

32:09.628 --> 32:12.164
What he means is, is that
the conspiracy starts

32:12.198 --> 32:14.200
at a single source
but can then spread.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.667
ALAN:
That's right,

32:15.701 --> 32:19.471
because the supervisors
oversee the county budget.

32:19.505 --> 32:22.041
I mean, they oversee
everything the county buys,

32:22.074 --> 32:23.042
which includes...

32:23.075 --> 32:23.842
voting equipment.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.144
Brasher could definitely
make sure

32:25.177 --> 32:27.013
the county only buys
their machines.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.515
Yeah, and with L.A.
County's huge population,

32:29.548 --> 32:32.751
rigged voting machines here
could make the difference

32:32.784 --> 32:34.253
in a statewide election.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.988
You know what they say--

32:36.022 --> 32:37.990
as California goes,
so goes the country.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.025
This Tuttle...

32:39.058 --> 32:41.227
wants to be a kingmaker.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.265
Hey.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.100
Megan just got a report
from Tru-Poll Systems.

32:48.134 --> 32:49.135
That's the
company that makes

32:49.168 --> 32:50.269
the electronic
voting machines.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.537
Uh-huh, and?

32:51.570 --> 32:53.305
Tru-Poll just updated
all the motherboards

32:53.339 --> 32:54.740
on their machines
in California.

32:54.773 --> 32:55.941
Now, the motherboards
are made in Taiwan

32:55.974 --> 32:59.211
by a company based here in
the States: SDKG Electronics.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.013
And the really
interesting part

33:01.047 --> 33:03.149
about SDKG-- it was founded
by this entrepreneur

33:03.182 --> 33:05.317
named Paul Prescott
two years ago.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.119
Tuttle approached him
about buying out his company

33:07.153 --> 33:08.320
and Prescott says no.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.422
Prescott died
in a rock-climbing accident.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.191
Really?

33:12.224 --> 33:14.326
It happens to a lot of people
that get in Tuttle's way.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.028
- Who owns that firm?
- A holding company

33:16.062 --> 33:18.264
that Tuttle sold one year ago.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.233
COLBY:
Well, Aliano

33:21.267 --> 33:23.769
was hired to design
a stock analysis program,

33:23.802 --> 33:26.472
but she was told that it should
also be able to alter prices.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.774
Right. Now, she didn't really
see the point,

33:28.807 --> 33:30.742
but Tuttle was paying
her well, so...

33:30.776 --> 33:32.444
So, what, it
changes votes?

33:32.478 --> 33:33.279
Apparently,
to a computer,

33:33.312 --> 33:35.247
votes and stocks
are the same thing.

33:35.281 --> 33:36.382
They're just a bunch
of number...

33:41.687 --> 33:43.322
If he's going
after Jane Aliano,

33:43.355 --> 33:45.357
that's a problem.

33:45.391 --> 33:45.724
Yeah, for us and for him.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.432
Aliano studied at UCSD.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.500
They say she's brilliant.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.701
Supposedly,
she told the FBI

33:55.734 --> 33:59.505
that "they picked the wrong
computer geek to mess with."

33:59.538 --> 34:02.141
Not the most threatening
statement I've ever heard.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.475
Her code must be hidden

34:03.509 --> 34:05.311
in the machine's
legitimate coding,

34:05.344 --> 34:06.612
probably in
the operating system.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.247
Oh, well, here.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.449
That's easy.
Tell you what you do.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.683
You need to look for the
computer code

34:11.717 --> 34:12.351
that looks like Jane's.

34:18.457 --> 34:20.259
This all looks
exactly the same.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.528
Well, all I have to do then
is write an algorithm

34:22.561 --> 34:24.096
to isolate her code
from the rest.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.164
Hey, do me a favor.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.298
Go find Dr. Finch.

34:26.332 --> 34:29.468
Tell her we need a priority run
on the supercomputer,

34:29.501 --> 34:31.103
and, you know, be convincing.

34:31.137 --> 34:35.174
I'll tell her the fate
of democracy is at stake.

34:35.207 --> 34:36.775
I like that.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.411
Jane's code
is embedded

34:39.445 --> 34:42.148
in the operating system
on the motherboard

34:42.181 --> 34:43.182
of the Tru-Poll machines.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.350
And you can prove that?

34:44.383 --> 34:46.552
Mathematically
incontrovertible.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.520
Well, how do the rigged
machines pass all the testing

34:48.554 --> 34:49.755
- they go through?
- Ah.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.857
Why don't you think of,
of voting

34:51.890 --> 34:54.160
on a voting
machine as a man

34:54.193 --> 34:56.528
reading instructions

34:56.562 --> 34:58.664
to assemble a model car,

34:58.697 --> 35:01.767
but you want the man
to build something different

35:01.800 --> 35:03.001
than this car.

35:03.034 --> 35:05.437
The easiest way is
to rewrite these directions.

35:05.471 --> 35:08.207
These re-written
instructions then become

35:08.240 --> 35:09.875
evidence of tampering.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.578
However, if you can alter
the operating system,

35:12.611 --> 35:15.281
the way the man interprets
the correct instructions,

35:15.314 --> 35:16.882
step one becomes step five,

35:16.915 --> 35:20.152
four wheels become two,
and red becomes green.

35:20.186 --> 35:23.755
See, the voting machine makes
illegal alterations, but only

35:23.789 --> 35:25.324
within the operating system,

35:25.357 --> 35:26.492
so there's no evidence.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.260
Mess with the
operating system,

35:28.294 --> 35:30.262
you can make that machine
do anything.

35:30.296 --> 35:32.531
Right, well, Jane Aliano
can testify to this

35:32.564 --> 35:34.200
unless Tuttle gets to her first.

35:34.233 --> 35:34.900
Yeah, we'd better get her

35:34.933 --> 35:35.701
someplace safe,
okay, guys?

35:55.654 --> 35:56.888
FBI! Get down!

35:56.922 --> 35:58.524
Get down!

35:58.557 --> 36:01.327
Down on the ground!
Put the gun on the ground!

36:01.360 --> 36:03.229
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

36:04.563 --> 36:05.731
(engine roaring)

36:05.764 --> 36:06.865
(tires screeching)

36:08.434 --> 36:09.668
Drop the gun.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.503
Hands behind your back.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.644
Mr. Dawkins, we just
arrested three men trying

36:18.677 --> 36:20.812
to assassinate
Jane Aliano.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.549
They're Tru-Poll Security
on your company payroll.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.417
Yeah, we also
cracked your coding.

36:25.451 --> 36:26.685
You conspired
with J. Everett Tuttle

36:26.718 --> 36:28.620
to tamper
with the voting machines

36:28.654 --> 36:29.655
and fix the election.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.357
As well as killing
six people.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.292
You will cooperate
with the investigation

36:33.325 --> 36:34.926
or you're going
to face the death penalty.

36:38.597 --> 36:39.765
Maybe you don't
quite understand

36:39.798 --> 36:40.866
what you're up
against here.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.401
No...

36:42.434 --> 36:43.569
I do know.

36:46.938 --> 36:50.642
I know exactly
what I'm up against.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.650
I intend to fully cooperate.

36:58.684 --> 36:59.918
You'll give us Tuttle?

36:59.951 --> 37:02.020
No.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.422
Tuttle wasn't part of this.

37:04.656 --> 37:05.924
This was my plan.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.360
My people. My machines.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.829
Tuttle had absolutely nothing
to do with any of it.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.800
He won't change his story.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.034
Yeah, his goons all back him.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.469
They took orders
directly from him,

37:17.503 --> 37:18.470
never even
heard of Tuttle.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.539
Yeah, but I say Tuttle's
got something on him.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.507
Whatever it is,

37:21.540 --> 37:23.675
it's scarier
than multiple murder charges.

37:23.709 --> 37:24.776
He's smart.

37:24.810 --> 37:25.944
Played it perfect.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.713
If Tuttle kills
Jane Aliano,

37:27.746 --> 37:29.681
we got no case... or this guy

37:29.715 --> 37:31.617
takes the fall.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.869
Agent Eppes.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.538
You know,
I may be retired,

37:52.571 --> 37:54.005
but I still have
appointments to keep.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.041
Election fraud,
conspiracy and murder.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.876
(laughs)

37:57.909 --> 38:02.514
You're constrained by limited
funds and inadequate manpower,

38:02.548 --> 38:04.783
and you've got a suspect
who's made a full confession.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.585
He's lying and I'm
gonna prove it.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.621
You're going to spend bureau
resources pursuing a case

38:09.655 --> 38:11.657
that's already been solved?

38:11.690 --> 38:13.492
And your superiors
are going to call that

38:13.525 --> 38:14.626
selective prosecution.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.727
You know that.

38:15.761 --> 38:18.797
And especially when
the congressmen start calling

38:18.830 --> 38:19.798
and complaining about you,

38:19.831 --> 38:20.732
which they will.

38:23.469 --> 38:26.104
You're just one man.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.507
Just like you, pal.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.523
Don.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.124
Hey. The Times has the story.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.661
The Brasher campaign,
Tru-Poll, Tuttle, all of it.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.363
The governor wants an
investigation; there's demand

38:51.397 --> 38:53.799
for a special grand jury. How'd
they even get it?

38:53.832 --> 38:55.634
That's what I'm wondering.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.770
Well, it wasn't me.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.410
DON:
I can't talk to the press

39:04.443 --> 39:05.677
about an open investigation,

39:05.711 --> 39:07.813
and I wouldn't, I mean,
not without proof.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.782
Well, who... who do you think
gave the story to the press?

39:10.816 --> 39:11.783
Uh... they might
have seen

39:11.817 --> 39:14.486
an advance copy of an article

39:14.520 --> 39:16.955
set to run in the Journal
of Political Science.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.824
Really, Charlie, you did this?

39:18.857 --> 39:19.925
What I did was

39:19.958 --> 39:22.761
I submitted an article detailing
my recent research.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.696
Charlie, you can get
into a lot of trouble.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.632
Yeah, it's possible,

39:26.665 --> 39:29.067
but it's unlikely because,
look, I-I used information

39:29.100 --> 39:30.101
that's in the public record.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.903
And the
organizational theory

39:31.937 --> 39:33.805
I performed linking
Tuttle's firm

39:33.839 --> 39:35.707
to Brasher's campaign
to Tru-Poll,

39:35.741 --> 39:37.943
th-that's all
mathematically solid.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.110
- The Journal leaked it?
- Yeah.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.612
They sent out
a summary

39:40.646 --> 39:41.613
to the general press.

39:41.647 --> 39:44.616
It's extremely difficult
to prevent a scientist

39:44.650 --> 39:45.551
from publishing his research.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.119
Academic freedom is
big in this country.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.755
Yeah, apparently so.

39:49.788 --> 39:50.989
Yeah, so Tuttle wasted his time.

39:51.022 --> 39:54.793
He wasted all that money trying
to devise his little scheme.

39:54.826 --> 39:55.961
It was all useless...

39:55.994 --> 39:57.796
...because now the voting
officials

39:57.829 --> 39:59.931
will know what
to look for. (doorbell rings)

39:59.965 --> 40:00.932
You did good, Chuck.

40:00.966 --> 40:03.435
But Tuttle's still not in jail.

40:03.469 --> 40:04.436
Hey, I'm not done

40:04.470 --> 40:05.537
with him yet, don't you worry.

40:05.571 --> 40:06.805
(door opens)

40:06.838 --> 40:08.139
What's up?

40:08.173 --> 40:09.675
Hello, Don, Mr. Eppes.

40:09.708 --> 40:10.676
- Hi.
- Oswald.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.110
Hey, did you see the news?

40:12.143 --> 40:13.211
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.913
It's on CNN and stuff.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.515
I got to tell
you, man,

40:16.548 --> 40:19.117
this is like nothing
I've ever felt before.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.853
I, it's really big,
you know?

40:21.887 --> 40:24.122
Yeah, it was, it was,
it was important work.

40:24.155 --> 40:27.826
Was, was that your plan,
to show me the powers of math

40:27.859 --> 40:29.528
in fighting evil?

40:29.561 --> 40:31.930
Because it, it worked.
You got me.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.199
I'm applying to Cal Sci.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.568
Dude, that's,
that's awesome.

40:36.602 --> 40:37.969
You're right, another one.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.705
Well, we can
always use one more.

40:39.738 --> 40:40.706
Are you kidding?

40:40.739 --> 40:41.807
They're taking over here.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.609
You're right.

40:47.513 --> 40:50.682
(phone ringing)

40:50.716 --> 40:51.950
Reeves.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.788
Yes, sir.

40:56.822 --> 41:00.759
I... I have given it
a lot of thought actually,

41:00.792 --> 41:04.730
and I don't think I can do it.

41:04.763 --> 41:05.864
I understand, but...

41:10.836 --> 41:13.104
So I don't actually have
a choice in the matter?

41:16.908 --> 41:18.176
Yes, sir.

41:20.879 --> 41:25.817
* I don't remember much,
if anything *

41:25.851 --> 41:28.887
* Of those years,
kinda strange *

41:28.920 --> 41:31.156
* Kinda sad, considering

41:31.189 --> 41:33.992
* All the laughs and all

41:34.025 --> 41:36.494
* The tears.
