fated villagers to inhabit.

00:06.320 --> 00:09.960
-Where is the third?
-Let it happened, fated one.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.880
She is protected by love.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.640
One break up away from Doom?

00:14.840 --> 00:16.080
Time for the Summoning.

00:16.280 --> 00:21.360
-No!
-Rise again unto this plane.

00:25.840 --> 00:32.440
# I left my friends for my new life
How will I know it's gonna be all right? #

00:32.560 --> 00:39.280
# I got to take control
And write my destiny #

00:39.440 --> 00:44.560

01:16.480 --> 01:19.560
Hey, Sorsha it’s me.
We’re blowing the cobwebs away.

01:19.760 --> 01:25.280
Just two girls running,
which is legal here, I checked. Call me.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.920
Sorsha! Are you okay?

01:40.040 --> 01:43.200
Is it your Founder? Esmerelda and Lacie?

01:44.200 --> 01:48.080
Isn’t it time to let the others know?
No.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.760
Seb can’t know. Promise me.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.360
Okay. For now.
So, why’d you flake out on me?

01:57.680 --> 02:00.160
Something came up.

02:00.360 --> 02:04.520
Sweet Veronica, what is that?

02:04.680 --> 02:06.400
Hollowfall.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.760
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

02:12.920 --> 02:15.120
May I ask why?

02:15.320 --> 02:20.160
Why what? Why we tolerate your presence?
Your questions?

02:20.360 --> 02:23.160
Your tedious sanctimony?
(SCOFFS)

02:23.360 --> 02:24.640
You forgot the smell.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.080
Why you made me help you raise Hollowfall?

02:29.280 --> 02:32.000
It’s been lost between realms
for centuries.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.800
Sorsha Doyle has our sister locked away
inside her.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.320
Protected by puppy love for Seb.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.280
Sorsha’s puppy is about to take a trip
to "the farm."

02:42.320 --> 02:44.440
Everybody knows the legend.

02:44.560 --> 02:50.080
When Hollowfall rises, a champion must be
sent from Evermoor to foster peace.

02:50.280 --> 02:55.760
All the young people will volunteer,
and I shall pick Seb.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.680
No one knows it’s a one-way trip.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.800
Once we’ve waved him off...

03:00.960 --> 03:03.680
...out of sight, out of mind.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.600
And Sorsha will fall to us.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.440
A village just appeared?

03:11.560 --> 03:14.760
It rises for one day, every 600 years.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.200
But it’s risen early.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.000
I'm guessing that's not cause
for celebration?

03:19.120 --> 03:24.440
Are you kidding? It’s the biggest thing
to happen here since... (STUTTERS)

03:24.560 --> 03:26.600

03:26.800 --> 03:30.760

A momentous day indeed!

03:30.920 --> 03:34.400
Hollowfall has honored us with its rising.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.600
It was an ancient seat of science
and progress.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.400
The Circle must convene.
What remains of it.

03:41.520 --> 03:45.200
Sebastian, as Page you may stay.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.840
Sending the right champion is crucial
to appease the Hollowmen.

04:01.080 --> 04:05.000
Let us follow the instructions
left by our Circle forebears.

04:08.440 --> 04:13.520

04:27.480 --> 04:29.320
Shall we?

04:29.480 --> 04:34.120
So, your folks are safely off to London,
which means...

04:34.320 --> 04:39.120
We skip school, do whatever we want,
and "Mission Awesome" is go.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.480
-What’s first?
-Depends.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.840
Do you want to jam with the dingle-horners
before or after we get bee-beards?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.280
Let’s do neither of those things.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.800
Ah, the very fellows!

04:50.960 --> 04:54.120
Let’s do what he wants, then we sneak off.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.600
Like goats who’ve chewed through
a leash.

cast in Hollowfall clay.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.280
Too heavy for my lumbago. (CHUCKLES)

05:06.440 --> 05:09.560
Do I have to ask
why you two are not at school yet?

05:09.760 --> 05:12.200
That won’t be necessary we’re happy to...

in the Urn of Champions.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.040
What about Hollowfall?

05:39.200 --> 05:44.000
Is there actually stuff to do there?
Or is it like, more sewing and frowning?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.000
We know very little.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.000

-(SCOFFS) Magic villages are the worst.

-I was 5.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.840
You don’t want to draw on a
millennium of romantic expertise?

15:16.000 --> 15:20.200
Just don’t open with "grasshopper barf
can mend a broken heart."

15:20.360 --> 15:22.200
That’s all I got.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.320
I made Seb believe in magic.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.000
I stayed in the Circle,
I even made him apply as Page.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.320
Those are the things that made him go.

15:32.520 --> 15:38.680
-Sorsha, your hand.
-It’s getting better. I don’t understand.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.560
I think I do, and I have an idea.

15:50.880 --> 15:56.160
Three cups, please.
We’re expecting a guest.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.920
Sister. You made the right choice.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.000
(DOOR OPENS)

16:07.120 --> 16:10.320
-So did you.
-(SCOFFS)

16:10.520 --> 16:13.320
Someone’s itching to tell us
her stupid plan.

16:13.520 --> 16:17.520
Well. It’s a little hard to
if you don’t get human emotions.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.960
Your sister is still in here.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.680
But she’s weakening.
I can’t hear her over how much I miss Seb.

16:26.840 --> 16:31.040
Out of sight, out of mind.
That’s what you were counting on...

16:31.200 --> 16:35.200
Don’t you know anything about love?
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.120
(SHRILL LAUGHTER)

16:38.280 --> 16:41.200
Checkmate! Your move, Smelly.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.360
So you want to make a deal?

16:44.360 --> 16:46.000
How thrilling.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.600
Now remember to sit still
until those casts set.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.000
-It shouldn’t take more than a fortnight.
-A Fortnight?

16:53.160 --> 16:56.240
Okay, now there are some humiliating
side-effects.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.320
But only if you care about
being pointed at and mocked.

17:00.520 --> 17:07.360
(CLEARS THROAT) Here’s a bell you can ring
in case of emergencies, and foot-rot.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.680
(SIGHS) So much for Mission Awesome.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.600
I had a lot of important wrestling
to watch today.

17:15.760 --> 17:19.320
Instead I got a baby hippo
where my foot used to be.

17:21.360 --> 17:24.000
(GRUNTING)

17:25.000 --> 17:26.920
(PANTING)

17:27.040 --> 17:28.560
Twin hippos...

17:28.720 --> 17:31.880
Do you see what this means?
We’re inseparable now.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.840
Forever! We’ll be two old-timers,
telling tall tales by the fire.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.400
Still joined at the foot.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.640
Emergency! (BELL CLANGING)

17:43.960 --> 17:46.680
We need three to help us complete
the chant.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.680
We’ve exhausted poor Budgie.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.720
And there’s one other condition...

17:52.880 --> 17:55.440
If you want Sebastian back.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.120
Name it.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.560
I don’t like this. I’m stopping it.

18:02.720 --> 18:07.600
Tara’s doing this so you don't end up
a lonely old woman or a tyrant.

18:07.760 --> 18:12.080
Take it from me, neither is a life choice
I'd recommend.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.680
We just need a third weaver,
to focus on the words and repeat them.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.080
The thread will do the rest.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.560
Not you.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.880
-Sorsha has to do it.
-What? No!

18:28.000 --> 18:30.280
Sorsha’s not strong enough.

18:30.440 --> 18:36.040
She contains magic even older
than your former powers, Tara.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.720
Oh? What’s wrong, America?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.000
Not so special anymore?

18:43.400 --> 18:46.600
I will do whatever it takes
to bring Seb home.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.320
Sorsha!
(SORSHA GRUNTS)

18:57.520 --> 19:03.560
(ALL) From the mud that life sustains,
rise again onto this plane.

19:03.720 --> 19:08.240
Farrum thremonda àmellus esk.

19:08.400 --> 19:14.560
From the mud that life sustains,
rise again onto this plane.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.080
Farrum thremonda àmellus esk.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.120
It’s working.
(GASPS)

19:21.280 --> 19:27.560
(WIND WHISTLING)
(RUMBLING)

19:32.600 --> 19:34.760
Sorsha, you did it!

19:37.800 --> 19:39.680
Sorsha, your hand.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.960
(WHOOSHING)

19:45.080 --> 19:46.600
Seb!

19:54.280 --> 20:01.200
-So, how does it feel to be a pioneer?
-I’d rather be a fireman.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.680
I’ll put a in a word with father.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.040
Bogbird chowder.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.520
So, you’ve regained your appetite.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.400
Yeah. But not my memory.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.440
Hollowfall is a blur.
I can’t remember any of it.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.600
And you thought you could keep her safe.

20:33.760 --> 20:37.160
And you thought you knew how love worked.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.520
Oh, but I don’t have to.

20:40.520 --> 20:44.720
Not anymore.
Now we can leave the messy work to you.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.200
You made an oath to guarantee
that boy’s return.

20:48.360 --> 20:52.840
Say the words. I want to enjoy them again.

20:53.840 --> 20:58.600
(SIGHS) I promise...

20:59.600 --> 21:01.920
...to break up Seb and Sorsha.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.880
That’s the spirit.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.680
Next time on Evermoor Chronicles...

21:12.840 --> 21:16.040
-What's "Snootcoming"?
-To elect the most popular couple.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.400
It drew the Founders inside
the lantern.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.240
The dance only works if performed
by the elected king and queen.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.880
I'll make them think
I'm spliting-up them up.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.960
Cameron and Sorsha have fallen in love.
(RETCHS)

21:28.080 --> 21:29.360
It was the truth.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.320
I saw you and Cameron.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.280
This break-up just became real.
