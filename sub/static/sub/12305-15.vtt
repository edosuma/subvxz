WEBVTT

00:54.932 --> 00:56.600
Hey, hand me a gigger.

00:57.059 --> 00:59.103
Uh, that would be your word for this?

01:02.356 --> 01:04.066
What the hell was that?

01:04.191 --> 01:08.028
The trick of fishing with
explosives the element of surprise.

01:08.070 --> 01:09.238
Explosives?

01:09.321 --> 01:11.991
Yeah. You didn't think we were going to
sit here for hours with poles and like,

01:12.074 --> 01:13.117
talk?

01:14.076 --> 01:15.244
Three fish?

01:15.286 --> 01:17.454
Not a lot of bang for your bang.

01:17.496 --> 01:18.664
All right,

01:23.544 --> 01:25.379
fire in the hole.

01:33.637 --> 01:37.349
See, better than two poles in six hours.

01:46.150 --> 01:47.276
Is that...

01:47.693 --> 01:49.195
No way.

01:53.324 --> 01:54.909
Don't touch it, Bart!

02:26.065 --> 02:27.983
We were cherry
- bombing the shallows for fish, and...

02:28.025 --> 02:29.443
as in illegal explosives?

02:29.485 --> 02:31.028
No one was around. I mean...

02:31.111 --> 02:33.197
- The girl in the car might disagree.
- her arm, you know,

02:33.239 --> 02:34.532
with no hand, and I dove in.

02:34.573 --> 02:36.200
If someone was down
there, it was like...

02:36.242 --> 02:37.409
some dead chick inside.

02:37.451 --> 02:41.038
she was tied at the
driving wheel with the tape

02:41.121 --> 02:43.165
She's dead, she's dead.

02:43.207 --> 02:47.169
Well, good, I tell you
something stay here for a second.

02:48.003 --> 02:50.172
What are you thinking, Horatio?

02:50.214 --> 02:53.884
There may be a fingerprint
preserved inside this duct tape.

02:53.926 --> 02:55.886
Check that please, would you?

03:09.733 --> 03:10.943
Horatio...

03:12.528 --> 03:13.988
you recognize the make and model?

03:14.029 --> 03:16.699
I recognize more than that, Frank.

03:16.740 --> 03:19.118
This is Kathleen Newberry.

03:24.874 --> 03:27.042
She's been missing for over a week.

03:27.918 --> 03:30.129
Where's Kathleen, Julia?

03:30.171 --> 03:31.881
Why are you asking me that?

03:32.089 --> 03:34.091
Kyle got out of prison
because Julia Winston

03:34.133 --> 03:36.051
paid her a million reasons to disappear.

03:37.720 --> 03:38.971
Any sign of the money, Frank?

03:39.054 --> 03:39.763
No.

03:39.889 --> 03:41.891
She had a fast car and a bag of money.

03:42.224 --> 03:44.143
She could've ended up anywhere.

03:45.269 --> 03:47.271
Anywhere but here.

05:00.471 --> 05:03.557
Always makes me nervous
when the crowd is so close.

05:03.849 --> 05:05.559
There's not a lot of dry
land to stand on here.

05:05.601 --> 05:06.935
It's a bit tight today.

05:07.019 --> 05:10.314
Yeah, but it's just such
a gruesome thing to watch.

05:12.566 --> 05:13.776
I don't know.

05:17.863 --> 05:19.198
Something's off.

05:19.490 --> 05:20.657
What's that?

05:21.617 --> 05:23.535
Her sunpass is missing.

05:23.827 --> 05:26.205
Remember, we tracked
her as far north as boca.

05:26.330 --> 05:28.791
Yeah, and then her car ended
up all the way back down here.

05:28.874 --> 05:30.376
Yeah, that doesn't add up.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.879
All right, we still have the court
order to check the sunpass archives.

05:33.921 --> 05:35.339
It might be worth looking into.

05:35.381 --> 05:37.091
Yeah, maybe the killer made a mistake.

05:37.132 --> 05:38.717
The sunpass could take us right to him.

05:38.759 --> 05:39.927
I'll call it in.

06:31.687 --> 06:33.188
So, what do you got?

06:33.355 --> 06:36.567
I happened to catch a glimpse of
this blonde hair in the zipper here.

06:36.650 --> 06:37.484
May I?

06:38.027 --> 06:40.029
Finish what you started.

06:42.948 --> 06:45.701
This obviously is not hers.

06:47.161 --> 06:48.412
What was the cause of death?

06:48.579 --> 06:50.247
Well, her lungs are full of water.

06:50.331 --> 06:51.665
She drowned.

06:59.089 --> 07:02.593
But the bruising on her wrists
and knees indicate she struggled

07:02.676 --> 07:04.428
before losing consciousness.

07:04.470 --> 07:05.971
So she was alive when she went down.

07:06.138 --> 07:06.847
Yeah.

07:10.059 --> 07:11.560
I'll have it in a bit.

07:11.643 --> 07:12.478
Okay, great.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.313
I'm going to go run
this in the meantime.

07:14.396 --> 07:15.439
Thanks.

08:38.188 --> 08:41.567
Somehow I knew you
wouldn't stay away, Horatio.

08:41.607 --> 08:44.445
We found Kathleen
Newberry's body, Julia.

08:44.737 --> 08:46.363
I never even met her.

08:46.989 --> 08:49.700
My assistant Pamela
gave her my care package.

08:49.742 --> 08:52.244
A $1 million care package.

08:52.369 --> 08:54.621
Enough for her to start a new life,

08:54.705 --> 08:56.332
and get our son out of prison.

08:56.373 --> 08:59.043
The money is gone.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.171
I watch the news.

09:02.504 --> 09:05.382
Do you I think I'm capable
of tying her to her car

09:05.424 --> 09:07.551
and pushing it into the everglades?

09:08.344 --> 09:13.891
We recovered your fingerprint on the
tape that was used to bind her body.

09:14.350 --> 09:17.019
Anyone could have taken it from my home.

09:17.311 --> 09:20.189
There are a lot of people out
there with motive to frame me.

09:23.067 --> 09:25.402
I'm looking at one right now.

09:28.530 --> 09:30.783
You're still mad Kyle chose me over you.

09:30.866 --> 09:33.619
Julia, you're in deep trouble.

09:33.744 --> 09:35.412
I didn't kill her.

09:35.704 --> 09:37.247
Why can't you just believe me?

09:37.331 --> 09:41.835
Because I haven't heard the truth yet.

09:52.346 --> 09:53.681
Waiting on a result?

09:54.515 --> 09:55.808
As usual.

09:57.976 --> 09:59.269
You hear about Julia?

09:59.728 --> 10:02.147
We found her print on the
tape that bound Kathleen.

10:02.231 --> 10:03.524
Not surprised.

10:03.691 --> 10:05.359
Last time I saw her she implied

10:05.401 --> 10:07.403
that we weren't going to
see Kathleen Newberry again.

10:07.486 --> 10:09.863
So what, you're hoping to
tie this hair back to her?

10:09.988 --> 10:13.492
Yeah, case closed, and H
gets Kyle back in his life.

10:13.575 --> 10:14.368
Yeah.

10:20.124 --> 10:21.333
Is it Julia?

10:21.375 --> 10:22.292
No.

10:23.711 --> 10:25.671
But you know what, it's
the next best thing.

10:25.838 --> 10:27.673
It's Pamela's, her assitant.

10:28.007 --> 10:29.550
I'm going to go pay her a visit.

10:30.551 --> 10:34.555
I quit working for Julia right
after she got custody of Kyle.

10:34.763 --> 10:35.973
She fire you?

10:36.557 --> 10:37.516
No.

10:38.058 --> 10:40.144
You know as well as
I do she's dangerous.

10:40.269 --> 10:41.645
I left on my own accord.

10:42.730 --> 10:45.482
You didn't leave because you
got yourself a big payday?

10:45.524 --> 10:46.608
What are you talking about?

10:46.650 --> 10:49.820
I'm talking about your hair that
I found on Kathleen Newberry's body

10:49.862 --> 10:52.322
and the million dollars
that I didn't find.

10:52.364 --> 10:54.241
I didn't steal any money.

10:54.825 --> 10:58.328
The last time I saw her was
when I gave her Julia's gift.

10:58.662 --> 11:00.414
It's a shame what happened to her.

11:00.581 --> 11:02.249
How do you think your hair got on her?

11:04.084 --> 11:07.254
She... hugged me, right
before she left town.

11:13.844 --> 11:15.846
How can I ever thank you?

11:20.142 --> 11:22.728
And it clung to her this whole time.

11:23.312 --> 11:25.439
Hey, you're the scientist.

11:25.481 --> 11:27.775
And you're the suspect, again.

11:30.402 --> 11:32.696
Mind telling me how you
paid for all of this?

11:34.406 --> 11:36.867
If there's one thing
I learned from Julia,

11:37.409 --> 11:39.203
it's how to invest wisely.

11:39.453 --> 11:42.122
I'm sure that's not the only
thing you learned from Julia.

11:48.128 --> 11:49.421
Hey, how's it going?

11:49.672 --> 11:53.550
Hey, did Delko remember to touch base
with you about the sunpass court order?

11:53.592 --> 11:55.427
Yeah, he did, and they're
sending the records over.

11:55.511 --> 11:58.180
And I'm gonna go over to the
garage to process the Newberry car.

11:58.222 --> 11:59.973
Did you get the photos from
the crime scene this morning?

12:00.015 --> 12:00.724
I did.

12:00.766 --> 12:02.601
I am just about to download them.

12:02.726 --> 12:03.727
Okay. Great.

12:06.063 --> 12:07.231
Wait a minute.

12:10.901 --> 12:12.111
Oh, my god.

12:12.569 --> 12:13.862
What's wrong, Calleigh?

12:13.987 --> 12:16.281
All of my crime scene photos are gone.

12:16.532 --> 12:18.242
They're gone? What do
you mean, they're gone?

12:18.450 --> 12:19.284
Let me see.

12:22.663 --> 12:23.872
Well, they're not gone, they're black.

12:23.956 --> 12:26.208
Did you remember to take
the lens cap off the camera?

12:26.250 --> 12:28.002
Yes. Of course, I did.

12:30.838 --> 12:32.548
Okay, what does that mean?

12:41.056 --> 12:42.182
What is this?

12:42.349 --> 12:44.601
This memory disc isn't department issue.

12:44.977 --> 12:47.146
Did you let the camera out of your
sight at any point this morning?

12:47.187 --> 12:47.980
No.

12:48.480 --> 12:52.026
I mean, I may have set it
down for a second at the scene.

12:52.192 --> 12:54.278
Do you think somebody swapped it out?

12:54.987 --> 12:56.572
There's some prints on this.

12:56.613 --> 12:58.949
I think somebody is trying
to sabotage our case.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.084
So, what do you recall about
the car after it was recovered?

13:10.419 --> 13:13.297
Well, all of the doors were shut
except for the driver's side, of course

13:13.339 --> 13:15.174
that's where the victim was removed.

13:16.008 --> 13:18.927
The trunk was only
slightly ajar, not open.

13:35.611 --> 13:37.363
Hey, Calleigh, come here
and take a look at this.

13:40.991 --> 13:42.242
See this here?

13:42.409 --> 13:44.536
Somebody tampered with the lock.

13:48.415 --> 13:49.249
Here you go.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.167
Thank you.

13:56.256 --> 13:57.800
It looks like...

14:00.135 --> 14:01.804
looks like a piece of metal.

14:02.930 --> 14:05.015
You know, I think that
happened after it was submerged.

14:05.099 --> 14:07.476
That looks like the
tip of a fishing spear.

14:07.518 --> 14:10.104
The guys that found
her body were fishing.

14:13.190 --> 14:14.900
Duncan, I'm coming in.

14:16.068 --> 14:16.985
What are you doing, man?

14:17.027 --> 14:18.987
They're cops and they have warrants.

14:19.238 --> 14:21.407
So you guys stole the
money out of the trunk.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.409
All right, look, I'm pre
- law.

14:23.492 --> 14:25.452
I know about Florida's salvage rules.

14:25.577 --> 14:26.620
It's finders keepers.

14:26.745 --> 14:28.122
Then I'm sure you also know all about

14:28.163 --> 14:30.958
what it's like to interfere
with a murder investigation.

14:41.135 --> 14:44.304
All right, when you guys were there,
did you happen to steal anything else?

14:44.346 --> 14:45.139
Like what?

14:45.222 --> 14:46.098
Like anything.

14:46.140 --> 14:48.350
Evidence, a digital camera memory card?

14:48.392 --> 14:49.852
Did you take a sunpass?

14:49.893 --> 14:50.978
Um, no.

14:51.061 --> 14:53.981
No? Well, you just lied to me 15
seconds ago pretty convincingly,

14:54.023 --> 14:56.025
so I don't know why I
should believe you right now.

14:56.066 --> 14:56.900
He's not lying.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.110
Okay, save it, you guys.

14:58.152 --> 14:59.653
We already know that you've been lying.

14:59.778 --> 15:01.697
If you're willing to steal
money from a dead woman,

15:01.739 --> 15:04.158
then obviously you're willing to
take evidence to cover your tracks.

15:04.199 --> 15:05.075
Here's what's going to happen.

15:05.117 --> 15:08.704
We are going to confiscate every
computer, every digital camera,

15:08.829 --> 15:13.000
and every cell phone until we find the
evidence that's ours that's missing.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.169
Look, we're just two
guys in the wrong place...

15:15.294 --> 15:18.714
Actually, you're two guys in the
center of a murder investigation.

15:20.299 --> 15:21.800
You're both under arrest.

15:41.987 --> 15:42.988
Kyle.

15:47.576 --> 15:48.577
How are you?

15:49.536 --> 15:51.246
Just been trying to settle down,

15:51.330 --> 15:53.374
trying to sort
everything out in my head.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.210
Can I help you with that?

15:58.420 --> 16:00.297
Look, why are you still harassing mom?

16:00.381 --> 16:02.007
You don't really think
that she killed that woman.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.259
Son, that woman lost her life.

16:04.343 --> 16:06.303
Look, please, just leave her alone, dad.

16:06.679 --> 16:08.555
I can't do that, son.

16:09.848 --> 16:12.976
Look... okay, she's really,
really scared, dad, okay?

16:13.018 --> 16:15.312
I can tell that she's scared
and she doesn't want to admit it,

16:15.354 --> 16:16.814
and it has to be because of you.

16:16.897 --> 16:18.857
But she has no reason
to be afraid of me.

16:18.941 --> 16:20.484
But she is.

16:23.028 --> 16:25.280
Are you sure that's what's going on?

16:25.656 --> 16:27.074
Don't try to con me, okay?

16:27.157 --> 16:27.908
I came here...

16:27.950 --> 16:29.827
- ... and said what I needed to. I'm done.
- Keep your voice down.

16:29.952 --> 16:31.829
I've said what I came here to say.

16:31.870 --> 16:34.456
Okay, I'm not going to
let you use me against her.

16:54.002 --> 16:56.296
I can't believe we've gone through
all of Bart and Duncan's stuff

16:56.338 --> 16:58.006
and we still haven't
found the memory card.

16:58.173 --> 17:00.050
I know, I was kind of
hoping that we'd find

17:00.091 --> 17:02.469
Kathleen Newberry's
sunpass in all this stuff.

17:02.510 --> 17:05.180
Department of transportation did
give us access to all their records,

17:05.221 --> 17:06.431
and believe it or not,

17:06.473 --> 17:09.684
they have a license plate
camera at all their tollbooths.

17:09.726 --> 17:12.771
Oh, great, well, let's just hope
whoever was using it hasn't stopped.

17:12.811 --> 17:16.358
Will you pull up all of the tollbooths
that the sunpass has gone through?

17:19.069 --> 17:20.779
Hey, check your e
- mail.

17:23.990 --> 17:25.282
"Solve a crime with Calleigh"?

17:25.367 --> 17:26.534
What is this?

17:26.617 --> 17:30.747
I don't know, but this web link has been sent to everybody in the lab's e
- mail.

17:30.830 --> 17:32.791
Is it some sort of a joke?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.919
I don't think anyone's
laughing. Come here.

17:38.505 --> 17:40.966
"Solve a crime with Calleigh... or not. "

17:41.633 --> 17:45.303
Do you want to see "how one of Miami's
top CSIs really solves her cases?"

17:45.345 --> 17:46.263
Keep checking back

17:46.304 --> 17:50.141
and see the latest bungle Calleigh
Duquesne tries to cover up.

17:50.308 --> 17:51.893
Will you play the video?

17:52.394 --> 17:53.311
Sure.

17:57.107 --> 17:59.067
That looks like Delko's handwriting.

17:59.609 --> 18:00.944
That's so weird.

18:01.319 --> 18:03.154
The video makes it
look like you need help

18:03.196 --> 18:05.490
remembering how to
process a crime scene.

18:05.532 --> 18:07.784
Let's just move on from it, okay?

18:09.995 --> 18:14.040
That video looks like it was
taken by somebody in the crowd.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.042
Wait a minute.

18:16.126 --> 18:18.003
There's a comments section?

18:18.169 --> 18:21.214
Some pretty creepy things are
already being posted about you.

18:21.298 --> 18:22.007
Wait.

18:22.841 --> 18:24.092
Look at that picture.

18:24.134 --> 18:25.969
That angle could not
be taken from the crowd.

18:26.011 --> 18:27.429
That's from my camera.

18:27.554 --> 18:29.598
So whoever swapped the memory car

18:29.639 --> 18:31.766
is not trying to sabotage the case,

18:31.808 --> 18:33.351
they're messing with me.

18:34.644 --> 18:35.937
All right, let's just narrow it down.

18:36.104 --> 18:37.522
It's clearly not

18:37.606 --> 18:40.191
Bart and Duncan'cause you can't send e
- mail from booking.

18:40.233 --> 18:42.611
What I can do is I can take the e
- mail address

18:42.652 --> 18:44.029
and I can follow it back to a web site.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.113
No, you know what?

18:45.196 --> 18:46.114
Let's just leave it alone

18:46.197 --> 18:48.533
because I don't want these
pranks to mess up the case.

18:48.617 --> 18:51.661
Calleigh, I'm sorry, but the
memory card says different.

18:53.371 --> 18:55.457
Evidence has been compromised here,

18:55.498 --> 18:59.294
so we need to resolve this if we're
going to protect the investigation.

18:59.461 --> 19:03.173
Okay, but let's just get back
to the sunpass for a minute.

19:04.299 --> 19:05.300
Please.

19:08.011 --> 19:08.929
Okay.

19:09.971 --> 19:12.891
I plotted the usage of
Kathleen Newberry's sunpass.

19:12.933 --> 19:16.436
Whoever has it hasn't been shy, and
they've been using a regular route.

19:16.519 --> 19:18.688
This is the last tollbooth
they've been through.

19:18.730 --> 19:20.398
Can we pull up those
license plate photos?

19:20.440 --> 19:21.650
Yeah, we're lucky we have them,

19:21.691 --> 19:25.070
'cause the Department of transportation
usually throws them away right away.

19:29.991 --> 19:31.451
That's a semi.

19:32.786 --> 19:35.538
A semi explains why it's been
through so many tollbooths.

19:35.622 --> 19:38.458
I'm gonna go talk to Tripp and
have him bring the truck driver in.

19:39.459 --> 19:40.418
Thank you.

19:57.477 --> 19:58.478
Who the hell are you?

19:58.520 --> 20:01.064
Your nightmare. Get your butt down here.

20:02.399 --> 20:05.277
Is there, uh, some kind of problem?

20:06.486 --> 20:08.238
Hey, you can't go through my truck.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.573
You Ted Wallace?

20:10.407 --> 20:10.991
Yeah.

20:11.032 --> 20:12.867
This warrant says we can.

20:16.162 --> 20:18.123
You sure you're not Kathleen Newberry?

20:18.248 --> 20:19.749
You got her sunpass.

20:22.043 --> 20:24.212
You're a suspect in a
murder investigation.

20:24.296 --> 20:26.089
I don't know anything about a murder.

20:26.131 --> 20:28.383
I drive my routes and I keep to myself.

20:28.466 --> 20:29.593
Yeah, well,

20:30.594 --> 20:33.388
how'd you come across Kathleen
Newberry's sunpass, then?

20:34.097 --> 20:35.140
I found it.

20:35.181 --> 20:36.766
- Where?
- Here.

20:36.975 --> 20:39.311
I'd always bed down here
before I pick up at the port.

20:39.352 --> 20:42.606
I found it laying on the
ground about a week ago.

20:42.647 --> 20:44.733
I thought I'd save a few bucks on tolls.

20:44.816 --> 20:48.069
You can't arrest me for not
calling it in to lost and found.

20:48.111 --> 20:49.613
Lost and found? A woman's dead.

20:49.654 --> 20:51.114
We're locking up your truck.

20:51.197 --> 20:52.657
You're going to take a little ride.

20:56.745 --> 21:01.041
You know, Kathleen's body wasn't found
too far from here just a few miles.

21:01.333 --> 21:04.544
Think she stopped here on her way out of
town and got picked off by our trucker?

21:04.628 --> 21:08.506
I don't know by who, but I
know where I'm gonna look first.

21:12.802 --> 21:16.973
Well, the heaviest traffic area at
all these rest stops: the restrooms.

21:17.766 --> 21:19.017
A lot of people have been in and out of

21:19.059 --> 21:20.936
here since Kathleen
Newberry disappeared.

21:21.019 --> 21:22.687
Think there's any evidence left?

21:22.729 --> 21:25.982
Well, these places aren't exactly
known for their cleanliness.

21:27.651 --> 21:29.402
Towel dispenser's damaged.

21:30.862 --> 21:31.988
Maybe a struggle?

21:32.072 --> 21:33.156
Got something here.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.582
Got a faint sweet smell.
I bet you it's chloroform.

21:43.375 --> 21:45.085
So she was subdued.

21:47.170 --> 21:48.046
Yeah.

22:00.725 --> 22:04.020
The killer took her car, drove
a few miles to the glades,

22:04.312 --> 22:06.690
taped her up, and then he drowned her.

22:09.484 --> 22:11.903
That explains the how, but not the who.

22:12.612 --> 22:14.948
Got some dried blood over here, too.

22:17.909 --> 22:20.954
Well, like I told you, these places
aren't known for their cleanliness.

22:56.698 --> 22:59.159
We found your blood out
at the rest stop, Ron.

23:00.952 --> 23:02.245
Oh, I
- I know what it was.

23:02.287 --> 23:04.956
It was the, uh, it was
the, uh, towel dispenser.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.625
You know? It wasn't working.

23:06.666 --> 23:09.753
And I grabbed for it,
and I, I cut myself.

23:17.761 --> 23:21.222
So a woman was killed out
there, and you have a record.

23:21.264 --> 23:24.184
Yeah, I'm in the system
for, uh, real estate fraud.

23:24.226 --> 23:26.895
Real estate fraud and now murder, Ron.

23:32.234 --> 23:33.652
That's not a cut.

23:33.735 --> 23:35.153
It looks like a bite mark.

23:39.324 --> 23:42.118
Oh, I'm not sure you
can tell either way.

23:42.535 --> 23:44.246
But I told you what happened.

23:44.287 --> 23:44.996
That's what happened.

23:45.038 --> 23:47.290
And now I'm gonna tell
you what I think happened.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.586
You subdued Kathleen Newberry, Ron.

23:51.836 --> 23:53.421
She bit you.

23:53.546 --> 23:56.132
You drove her out to the Everglades

23:56.174 --> 23:57.884
and then killed her.

24:21.032 --> 24:23.535
I'm gonna ask you a
question that my lawyer will.

24:24.077 --> 24:26.204
Can you prove that?

24:26.246 --> 24:28.498
That's what I do.

24:38.842 --> 24:41.177
This is everything I have on Julia.

24:41.553 --> 24:43.888
She's had numerous run
- ins with the law.

24:43.930 --> 24:45.181
Nothing ever stuck.

24:45.724 --> 24:48.810
Has the name Ron Saris
been mentioned yet?

24:49.019 --> 24:50.645
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

24:50.770 --> 24:52.898
She was using one of her aliases,

24:52.939 --> 24:54.816
but they were both
brought in in St. Augustine

24:54.900 --> 24:58.695
for questioning about a
charity scam five years ago.

24:59.237 --> 25:00.989
Five years ago...

25:01.156 --> 25:03.158
no charges were filed, were they?

25:03.199 --> 25:03.825
No.

25:06.453 --> 25:07.579
What else?

25:09.247 --> 25:11.625
Nothing else about Ron Saris.

25:12.083 --> 25:12.959
But, um,

25:13.501 --> 25:15.503
there's something else you should know.

25:16.171 --> 25:17.505
What is it?

25:17.714 --> 25:19.299
Julia came to me.

25:20.467 --> 25:23.219
Someone must have tipped her
off that I was looking into her.

25:25.055 --> 25:27.724
Horatio, she asked me to work for her.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.020
Work on what?

25:32.270 --> 25:34.522
Specifically, about Marisol.

25:35.482 --> 25:37.359
And why you went to Brazil.

25:38.109 --> 25:42.781
She learned you had some trouble
down there, so she wanted details.

25:42.989 --> 25:44.324
Details?

25:45.742 --> 25:48.411
I never asked you about
what happened in Rio.

25:49.704 --> 25:50.747
Anyway, I...

25:51.581 --> 25:52.207
I wouldn't help her.

25:52.249 --> 25:53.792
I told her I wouldn't help her.

25:55.418 --> 25:56.795
Horatio, I...

25:57.254 --> 25:58.922
I don't trust this woman.

25:59.339 --> 26:01.591
And I don't think she's
one to give up easily.

26:01.675 --> 26:03.093
Neither am I.

26:07.138 --> 26:08.390
Julia...

26:09.057 --> 26:12.310
did Ron Saris murder Kathleen Newberry?

26:12.727 --> 26:15.564
I haven't seen or heard
from Ron in six years.

26:15.647 --> 26:16.856
Five years.

26:19.693 --> 26:21.444
It's been five years.

26:22.362 --> 26:27.242
And Ron is back in town and I
think you're in contact with him.

26:31.830 --> 26:34.499
We all have skeletons in our closet.

26:34.833 --> 26:37.294
But I've left mine behind for Kyle.

26:37.752 --> 26:40.046
I don't think you can
say the same thing.

26:43.300 --> 26:47.596
As it turns out, I didn't need
your P. I. Friend's help, after all.

26:48.054 --> 26:52.017
In Rio, money can buy
a lot of information.

26:58.023 --> 27:00.108
You murdered this man.

27:11.703 --> 27:15.582
Julia, this isn't going to work.

27:22.839 --> 27:24.424
Leave me alone.

27:45.521 --> 27:47.982
Ryan, what are you doing
on Calleigh's web site?

27:48.065 --> 27:50.234
Someone's interfering
with an investigation,

27:50.276 --> 27:52.403
and I'm going to figure out who it is.

27:52.778 --> 27:54.822
There are over 10, 000 hits.

27:54.864 --> 27:57.032
I thought that e
- mail only went out to us lab rats.

27:57.074 --> 28:00.077
Yeah, well, it went
viral, hence my urgency.

28:00.161 --> 28:03.205
Well, can't you just look up
who the site is registered to?

28:03.330 --> 28:05.416
I did. It's Sir Berners
- Lee.

28:07.793 --> 28:11.005
He created the internet,
so obviously, that's a fake.

28:11.172 --> 28:14.759
I also followed a bunch of ip
addresses, it all pretty much

28:14.925 --> 28:16.260
led to nowhere.

28:16.385 --> 28:18.262
Wow, someone's really
covering their tracks.

28:18.304 --> 28:19.138
Yeah.

28:19.180 --> 28:22.349
If we're going to find this guy, we're
gonna have to find him on his level.

28:22.391 --> 28:23.809
Meaning?

28:25.519 --> 28:27.188
The source code.

28:27.730 --> 28:29.690
That gobbledygook make sense to you?

28:29.732 --> 28:33.360
Yeah, those numbers control the
background color and the text.

28:33.819 --> 28:36.030
And that one's for the video player.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.824
Like, how Youtube works.

28:39.158 --> 28:41.952
Yeah, but this is a
different Flash video player.

28:42.286 --> 28:43.996
In fact...

28:47.249 --> 28:50.795
aside from a couple of tweaks,
it's exactly like the one we use.

28:50.836 --> 28:52.087
So?

28:53.130 --> 28:55.382
That's custom
- coded for us.

28:55.549 --> 28:56.717
By who?

28:56.926 --> 28:58.594
Hey, Calleigh, it's me.

28:59.762 --> 29:01.639
Yeah, I know who's messing with you.

29:08.437 --> 29:09.772
Hey, Cooper.

29:12.149 --> 29:13.776
Come right on in, Cal.

29:15.402 --> 29:17.363
Why are you doing this?

29:17.905 --> 29:19.115
Doing what?

29:19.240 --> 29:20.533
This.

29:21.784 --> 29:23.452
I always wanted to start a web site.

29:23.494 --> 29:25.037
Now I finally have the time.

29:25.371 --> 29:26.789
Thanks to you, by the way.

29:26.831 --> 29:28.999
Okay, look, I understand
that you are angry.

29:29.041 --> 29:31.669
I also understand that you
blame me for losing your job.

29:31.710 --> 29:32.711
I'm not angry.

29:32.753 --> 29:34.797
I used Speedle's credit
card, you caught me.

29:35.005 --> 29:37.591
The lab cannot afford judgment
errors by its employees.

29:37.633 --> 29:38.926
I'm just trying to insure that.

29:38.968 --> 29:41.720
You do realize that
destroying crime scene photos

29:41.762 --> 29:44.265
is an obstruction of justice, don't you?

29:44.306 --> 29:45.516
Something happen to your photos?

29:45.558 --> 29:48.060
My memory card was swapped,
but you already know that

29:48.102 --> 29:52.064
because I've already seen my crime
scene photos on your web site.

30:14.587 --> 30:16.213
Web site's a public forum.

30:16.338 --> 30:18.883
Any user can post a comment or photo.

30:19.049 --> 30:20.426
You can search my place if you want to.

30:20.468 --> 30:21.886
But thank you.

30:21.927 --> 30:24.096
Now I've got my next post for the site.

30:24.430 --> 30:26.140
Okay, you know what, Cooper?

30:26.307 --> 30:29.393
When you were fired, I
opted not to press charges.

30:29.477 --> 30:32.897
Please, do not force me into
rethinking that decision, okay?

30:33.022 --> 30:34.774
I haven't done anything wrong.

30:35.399 --> 30:37.109
None of this is against the law.

30:39.153 --> 30:40.654
You're not that guy.

30:41.197 --> 30:42.114
You made one mistake.

30:42.156 --> 30:43.657
Don't make it worse.

30:45.743 --> 30:47.369
I'll see you at the next crime scene.

30:49.121 --> 30:51.081
I really hope you don't.

31:14.980 --> 31:16.732
is that Kathleen Newberry's shirt?

31:16.774 --> 31:18.859
As a matter of fact, it is.

31:19.568 --> 31:22.905
See, once it dried, the
pattern revealed itself.

31:22.947 --> 31:25.366
You see this discoloration right here?

31:26.659 --> 31:28.077
Looks like the tread from a boot.

31:28.119 --> 31:32.248
What I initially thought
was a "v" is actually a "W."

31:32.373 --> 31:35.626
And that's the logo for
Woodridge hunting boots.

31:35.709 --> 31:37.378
Yes, it is.

31:47.471 --> 31:50.933
The stain has diesel fuel in it.

31:50.975 --> 31:53.936
Fortunately, that fuel
preserved the pattern for us.

31:54.019 --> 31:57.106
Let's bring in Mr. Ted Wallace.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.536
Woodridge hunting boots.

32:11.829 --> 32:13.247
Ted, pal.

32:14.290 --> 32:15.875
This isn't your lucky day.

32:15.916 --> 32:17.918
Are we still talking about
that dead girl in the car?

32:17.960 --> 32:19.170
We are, Ted.

32:19.211 --> 32:21.338
Check your notes from
our last chat, man.

32:21.505 --> 32:23.382
All right, I happened to
find this woman's sunpass.

32:23.424 --> 32:24.592
That's where my story ends.

32:24.633 --> 32:26.051
Well, you better start
telling us something, Ted,

32:26.093 --> 32:29.346
like how your boot print ended
up on Kathleen Newberry's shirt.

32:29.472 --> 32:31.390
I... I don't know.

32:31.557 --> 32:33.726
I've been in that
restroom a million times.

32:33.809 --> 32:37.104
Maybe I tracked something in
and she fell on my boot print.

32:43.569 --> 32:45.196
I'm not your guy.

32:45.237 --> 32:47.364
Well, who is my guy then?

32:52.453 --> 32:53.662
All right, look...

32:54.622 --> 32:57.541
he had a sunpass in one hand...

32:57.625 --> 32:59.376
and five thou cash in the other.

32:59.418 --> 33:01.712
All I got to do is
take my rig up north...

33:01.754 --> 33:03.464
and take his sunpass with me.

33:03.506 --> 33:04.548
Look at these guys.

33:04.590 --> 33:06.675
Can you identify him
amongst these men, too?

33:06.717 --> 33:08.511
No, man, they could've
been kermit the frog.

33:08.552 --> 33:11.055
Ted, pal, do me a favor
- really take a look.

33:13.099 --> 33:14.809
Maybe this guy.

33:15.976 --> 33:18.354
All I cared about was the cash.

33:19.396 --> 33:20.940
Was he with a woman?

33:21.065 --> 33:22.024
No.

33:26.946 --> 33:29.532
At the time, it seemed like easy money.

33:30.783 --> 33:32.743
I sure didn't think it
was tied to any killing.

33:32.785 --> 33:35.788
Well, we all make mistakes,
Ted... this is yours.

33:35.830 --> 33:37.456
Take him, please.

33:55.558 --> 33:56.600
Julia.

33:58.310 --> 33:59.728
Hello, Horatio.

34:00.020 --> 34:04.024
Ron saris is about to go down for
the murder of kathleen newberry.

34:04.066 --> 34:05.901
Bring him in, please.

34:05.985 --> 34:08.279
I can't do that, Horatio.

34:08.320 --> 34:10.614
He's going to take you down, too...

34:14.659 --> 34:15.786
you know...

34:16.661 --> 34:18.289
Julia, I'm sick of this.

34:18.330 --> 34:20.331
We've been doing this
your way up until now.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.585
Now we're going to do it my way.

34:22.668 --> 34:24.837
He's dead... dead... dead.

34:24.879 --> 34:28.007
Wait. You
- you can't just kill a cop. You...

34:29.216 --> 34:30.885
Why are you protecting him?

34:31.135 --> 34:32.178
- Why?
- Come on. Ron...

34:32.303 --> 34:33.512
- you still love him, don't you?
- Ron...

34:33.596 --> 34:35.431
Tell me, look at me. You
still love him, don't you?

34:35.473 --> 34:36.181
That's what it is.

34:36.223 --> 34:37.641
No, come on.

34:37.766 --> 34:38.516
Look...

34:39.393 --> 34:41.312
look, I can make him disappear.

34:44.023 --> 34:45.690
Come on, R on.

34:45.983 --> 34:47.568
Tell me...

34:48.319 --> 34:50.279
I just need to make one call.

34:50.780 --> 34:51.362
Yeah?

34:51.739 --> 34:53.783
I only want to be with you.

34:58.412 --> 35:01.373
Yeah, well, that's all I've
ever wanted, was to be with you.

35:13.010 --> 35:15.471
I need to speak with who's in charge.

35:32.363 --> 35:33.948
Where's Ron, Julia?

35:34.490 --> 35:36.826
I asked you to let this go, Horatio.

35:36.867 --> 35:39.161
You are protecting a murderer.

35:40.454 --> 35:41.956
What does he have on you?

35:41.997 --> 35:43.707
This has nothing to do with him.

35:43.833 --> 35:44.708
Julia,

35:45.084 --> 35:49.338
I want to help you, but this
is going to be my last chance.

35:50.798 --> 35:52.716
I don't need your help.

35:53.843 --> 35:55.678
Besides, it's too late.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.311
Oh... I'm sorry, Horatio.

36:05.479 --> 36:09.191
You may not understand this
now, but it's for your own good.

36:21.787 --> 36:23.914
U. S. Marshal's office just notified us,

36:23.956 --> 36:26.709
a judge just granted a
warrant for your arrest.

36:26.792 --> 36:27.835
Granted to who?

36:27.877 --> 36:30.254
Brazilian federal police.

36:30.421 --> 36:32.131
They're en route to
take you into custody.

36:32.214 --> 36:35.509
You're being extradited
to Brazil, this afternoon.

36:36.385 --> 36:38.512
They're charging you
with murder, Horatio.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.852
Horatio, I want you to know that
we're going to be here for you,

36:58.894 --> 37:00.187
no matter what.

37:00.353 --> 37:02.814
We need to stay focused
on the newberry case.

37:02.898 --> 37:03.648
Okay.

37:03.732 --> 37:06.776
I just got a call on a possible
lead. I'm going to head there now.

37:06.860 --> 37:08.320
We'll hold down the fort.

37:08.528 --> 37:10.155
I'd appreciate that, ma'am.

37:15.577 --> 37:18.330
You go voluntarily, you wave
your right to fight extradition.

37:18.371 --> 37:20.790
It's not going to make
a difference, Rick.

37:23.543 --> 37:25.295
That won't be necessary.

37:27.380 --> 37:28.757
Lieutenant Caine, you ready?

37:28.798 --> 37:29.799
Yes, sir.

37:29.966 --> 37:31.092
Let's go.

38:05.502 --> 38:07.504
Natalia, what are you doing?

38:07.712 --> 38:08.922
This is exactly what Cooper wants.

38:08.964 --> 38:10.131
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

38:10.173 --> 38:12.634
It's just that... You
know, this is really scary,

38:12.676 --> 38:14.052
because we're not the only
people who can see this.

38:14.094 --> 38:15.929
The criminals could be studying this.

38:16.012 --> 38:17.556
And studying us.

38:19.432 --> 38:21.059
He's at it again.

38:21.935 --> 38:23.478
Wait a minute. I thought
that she talked to him.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.896
Yeah, well, he obviously didn't listen,

38:24.938 --> 38:26.898
'cause he just updated the web page.

38:26.940 --> 38:28.275
What, a spider?

38:28.817 --> 38:30.902
Black widow? What's
that supposed to mean?

38:31.987 --> 38:34.823
"This southern belle has a deadly bite. "

38:34.906 --> 38:37.951
"John hagen, a decorated
homicide detective,"

38:38.160 --> 38:41.329
"performed his own little
Duquesne mutiny, ' "

38:41.413 --> 38:45.625
"by committing suicide in this venomous
little CSI's very own firearms lab. "

38:45.750 --> 38:47.043
Oh, my god.

38:48.128 --> 38:49.963
Has cooper lost his mind?

38:50.046 --> 38:52.048
No, but he's escalating.

38:52.174 --> 38:53.466
Is calleigh in the lab?

38:53.508 --> 38:57.220
Uh, no. The last I heard, she went out
to follow a lead on the newberry case.

38:57.345 --> 38:59.764
You've reached CSI Calleigh
Duquesne with damn it,

38:59.848 --> 39:01.808
it's going straight to voicemail.

39:01.933 --> 39:03.476
It means her phone's
off. That's not like her.

39:03.518 --> 39:05.020
No, that's not good.

39:07.647 --> 39:08.732
What are you doing?

39:08.773 --> 39:11.318
Checking the GPS tracker on her Hummer.

39:14.571 --> 39:15.989
He couldn't have sent
her out on a fake call.

39:16.072 --> 39:17.657
She just had her number changed.

39:17.699 --> 39:19.159
Yeah, he could have.

39:20.619 --> 39:22.537
He posted her new number.

39:32.631 --> 39:34.549
- Where is she?
- I don't know!

39:34.633 --> 39:35.717
What the hell are you doing, huh?

39:35.800 --> 39:37.177
What are you doing, Cooper?

39:37.302 --> 39:39.846
I was just having a little
bit of fun, man, all right?

39:39.930 --> 39:42.182
Little miss perfect needed to
be taken down a notch or two.

39:42.265 --> 39:44.059
So I videotaped her. So what?

39:44.184 --> 39:47.270
Videotape? You've been harassing her
on the web site, and now she's missing.

39:47.312 --> 39:49.272
Well, Calleigh's a big girl;
she can take care of herself.

39:49.314 --> 39:50.106
She can take of herself?

39:50.148 --> 39:52.025
You posted her new
number on the web site!

39:52.067 --> 39:53.527
It's not against the law.

39:53.652 --> 39:57.656
Yeah? What if some felon, what if some
felon calls her out to a location, huh?

39:57.697 --> 39:59.282
You think about that?

40:00.992 --> 40:02.536
Yeah, that's what I thought.

40:02.619 --> 40:05.789
If something happens to her, Cooper,
I'm going to come back here and kill you.

40:50.333 --> 40:51.793
Lieutenant Caine.

40:53.837 --> 40:55.630
I have to admit...

40:55.839 --> 40:57.883
I never thought we'd
see you back in Rio.

40:58.258 --> 40:59.634
Why am I here?

41:00.969 --> 41:03.680
We needed time to build a case.

41:05.348 --> 41:08.977
And somebody made it worth
your while, right, chief?

41:09.186 --> 41:11.479
I do not like what you're implying.

41:11.605 --> 41:14.191
You hunted down and
killed Antonio Riaz...

41:14.274 --> 41:15.484
That is why you're here.

41:15.567 --> 41:16.735
He murdered my wife.

41:16.776 --> 41:18.820
And so you murdered him.

41:21.239 --> 41:25.535
Chief, let's just say that Mr.
Riaz got what was coming to him.

41:26.620 --> 41:27.913
You'd testify to that?

41:27.954 --> 41:29.748
In a real court, I might.

41:31.458 --> 41:33.627
No courtroom is necessary.

41:33.835 --> 41:36.004
I just wanted to hear you admit it.

41:36.838 --> 41:39.216
I admitted to nothing.

41:43.637 --> 41:45.388
So what happens now?

41:54.231 --> 41:55.941
It is very simple.

41:56.817 --> 41:58.693
As far as I'm concerned...

42:00.779 --> 42:02.906
You are free to go.

42:05.867 --> 42:08.036
Just like that, huh?

42:08.078 --> 42:09.496
Yes.

42:11.248 --> 42:12.999
Just like that.

42:18.797 --> 42:19.798
But...

42:20.924 --> 42:22.467
You should know,

42:23.802 --> 42:26.596
you made a lot of enemies
the last time you were in Rio.

42:33.144 --> 42:36.606
And this is your way
of saying "Good luck. "

42:37.190 --> 42:38.942
I admit to nothing.

42:39.151 --> 42:41.736
But... Good luck.
