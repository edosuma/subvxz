he's gonna kick open the doors

00:07.633 --> 00:09.715

and a year from now

00:09.802 --> 00:11.713

00:11.887 --> 00:14.754
The name of the next

00:19.269 --> 00:22.261

We have assumed control

the nice things in life.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.640

accept no shame in this.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.937

like hand cream as

01:51.528 --> 01:53.393

to treasure.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.107

civilization.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.781
So you'll no doubt
understand when l

01:58.869 --> 02:00.405
accepted the role of
Provisional Mayor,

02:00.496 --> 02:01.861
eight-and-a-half
months ago,

02:01.955 --> 02:03.695
l was apprehensive.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.622
I imagined those
Wild West movies

02:05.709 --> 02:07.210
my father was
so fond of.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.834
A town hill of
anarchists,

02:09.922 --> 02:12.038
malcontents
and savages.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.836
How wrong I was.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.804
Put simply, Deﬁance
is paradise.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.344
Look around you,

02:23.894 --> 02:25.600
in any direction
and you'll ﬁnd

02:25.687 --> 02:26.938
indescribable beauty.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.972
This is a town of
people who know how

02:30.067 --> 02:31.557
to have a good time.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.483
But when the moment
comes to roll up the sleeves

02:33.570 --> 02:35.686
and get down to the
nifty-gritty.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.151
no one works harder
for a living.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.533
And that hard work has
turned Deﬁance into a

02:45.082 --> 02:46.242
And I predict,

02:46.959 --> 02:48.665

02:58.428 --> 03:00.384
that makes this
town so unique,

03:01.765 --> 03:03.096
is your inclusiveness.

side by side

03:07.437 --> 03:10.019

03:10.357 --> 03:11.813
It's truly inspiring.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.975
In my time as mayor.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.980
I've worked every single
day to live up

03:16.071 --> 03:17.527
to the lolty standard
the people

03:17.614 --> 03:18.649

for me.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.608
Together, we have
reduced crime.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.156
We've rebuilt the
stasis net.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.197
By nationalizing
the gulanite mines.

03:28.292 --> 03:31.284
we have doubled wages and
tripled productivity.

03:32.588 --> 03:35.204
And now. I'd like to thank
my colleagues at the
Earth Republic.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.711
In particular. Viceroy
Berto Mercado

03:37.885 --> 03:39.876
who has made the long trip
from New York

03:39.970 --> 03:41.961
to celebrate with us today.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.637
Thanks to their generous
ﬁnancial assistance

03:45.309 --> 03:48.051
the long-delayed
Mag-Lev Spur will ﬁnally

03:48.145 --> 03:49.225
become a reality!

03:49.438 --> 03:52.054
Now I know you're all itching
to get to the party, so

03:52.149 --> 03:55.232
without ﬁrrther ado,
allow me to wish you a

03:55.319 --> 03:58.686
happy and prosperous
Founders Day!

04:02.993 --> 04:04.608

Mr. Mayor.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.284
Thank you. Berlin.
Thank you.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.363

You're pretty with the

04:12.127 --> 04:13.628

With your big
words. your hand lotion.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.422
But I tell you something. I
never met a show-off who

04:26.516 --> 04:27.676
was quite as smart as he
thought he was.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.804
Well. now that you ﬁnally
have. you can tell your

04:29.895 --> 04:31.260
grandkids all about it.

04:31.355 --> 04:34.643
Oh. (LAUGHS) I'll
have to remember that.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.564
The viceroy is a
powerful man.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.197
Why do you go out of
your way to make him mad?

04:45.869 --> 04:48.702
Mercado only respects
people he hates.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.909
You should remember
that. Churchill.

mayor now.

I'd catch this one?

05:15.565 --> 05:16.975
Blind optimism. I guess.

much more for Deﬁance.

right to be here?
