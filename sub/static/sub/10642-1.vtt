<i>The case that makes you... </i>

00:11.607 --> 00:15.547
<i>... pushes you to your limits,
earns you that badge.</i>

00:17.384 --> 00:20.686
<i>And the one that breaks you.</i>

00:21.610 --> 00:23.409
<i>Rips it all apart.</i>

01:05.018 --> 01:06.283
Hi, there!

01:06.319 --> 01:10.253
I'm Claire Warren, and
I'm running for City Council.

01:10.289 --> 01:11.388
Hi, there. Hi.

01:11.424 --> 01:14.123
I'm Claire Warren, and
I'm running for City Council.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.124
I want...

01:15.159 --> 01:16.058
Have a nice day.

01:16.093 --> 01:18.828
Vote for my mom!
She'll give you 10 bucks.

01:18.863 --> 01:19.733
- Danny!
- Hi!

01:19.758 --> 01:20.586
Hi, there.

01:20.611 --> 01:22.544
I'm Claire Warren, and
I'm running for City Council.

01:22.638 --> 01:24.504
Might I have just a moment with you?

01:24.539 --> 01:25.739
<i>You don't suck at this.</i>

01:25.774 --> 01:26.673
I do. I kind of suck at this.

01:26.708 --> 01:28.388
- Honey, no.
- I do.

01:28.423 --> 01:30.408
Who am I to think
that somebody will actually vote

01:30.444 --> 01:33.661
for some lame, cupcake-baking,
stay-at-home mom.

01:33.686 --> 01:34.886
 Really!

01:34.969 --> 01:37.036
Yo, can I bail now? I'm out of flyers.

01:37.071 --> 01:38.312
Mother, he's buying you votes.

01:38.337 --> 01:39.482
Great! How many?

01:39.518 --> 01:41.674
Hello! It's called election fraud.

01:41.709 --> 01:43.842
Okay. Let's get some ice cream.

01:43.878 --> 01:45.277
I can't believe this.

01:45.312 --> 01:47.446
Democracy is so dead.

01:48.882 --> 01:50.915
Hey.

01:50.951 --> 01:52.917
Oh, wow.

01:52.953 --> 01:55.920
This is the best one yet, Chief.

01:55.956 --> 01:57.121
Where's the crew?

01:57.156 --> 01:59.691
There is no crew. It's a ghost ship.

02:00.727 --> 02:02.794
Want some ice cream?

02:02.829 --> 02:05.929
 You're getting heavy.

02:05.965 --> 02:07.698
All right. See you, guys!

02:07.733 --> 02:09.259
See you later. Watch Adam!

02:09.285 --> 02:10.460
Yeah.

02:10.485 --> 02:12.302
Danny. Danny, wait!

02:12.337 --> 02:13.937
We're supposed to stay with Adam!

02:13.973 --> 02:17.107
And how can I help you there, son?

02:17.142 --> 02:18.875
Help you with something?

02:22.013 --> 02:24.714
I need a ride.

02:30.822 --> 02:32.287
Have you seen Adam?

02:34.258 --> 02:35.055
Hey!

02:35.090 --> 02:36.019
I can't find Adam.

02:36.044 --> 02:37.935
I've looked everywhere. He's gone.

02:37.970 --> 02:40.729
Well, look again. Come on.

02:46.298 --> 02:47.443
Man: Adam!

02:47.478 --> 02:49.738
- Adam!

03:06.747 --> 03:09.393
 The two of you were
supposed to be watching him!

03:09.447 --> 03:11.114
He was fine. He was with Willa, and...

03:11.149 --> 03:12.718
No, but you never should
have left them alone!

03:12.753 --> 03:14.514
You're the oldest! You're in charge!

03:14.535 --> 03:16.069
Except when he's getting to
third base with some slut.

03:16.103 --> 03:18.986
Like you'd ever know what
that is, you freak of nature!

03:19.021 --> 03:19.905
Stop it.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.074
Turning on each other
won't help anyone...

03:22.109 --> 03:23.208
Definitely not Adam.

03:23.243 --> 03:26.144
The first few hours of a
missing-child case are critical,

03:26.180 --> 03:28.707
and if you spend them
screaming at each other

03:28.743 --> 03:30.468
instead of remember what he was wearing,

03:30.503 --> 03:31.816
what he was doing, or
who he was doing it with,

03:31.851 --> 03:33.517
you might as well bury
your kid right now.

03:35.755 --> 03:37.321
You're the officer they sent?

03:37.356 --> 03:38.723
She's just a little girl, John.

03:38.758 --> 03:40.825
I'm the little girl
who's gonna find your son.

03:48.634 --> 03:50.767
 Who do you need to see again?

03:50.802 --> 03:52.760
Office Meyer.

03:52.787 --> 03:55.287
Well, watch out, man. It's
big-time detective now.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.523
She'll eat you for that.

03:57.558 --> 03:58.724
Meyer!

03:58.759 --> 04:00.759
What, Tom? What?

04:05.331 --> 04:07.298
Can I, uh, help you with something?

04:07.333 --> 04:09.467
You Nina Meyer?

04:09.502 --> 04:12.603
Yeah. And who are you?

04:16.642 --> 04:17.909
I'm him.

04:30.847 --> 04:32.914
I promised the people of Red Pines

04:32.949 --> 04:35.250
a return to family
values, and I meant it.

04:35.285 --> 04:37.151
 But don't you think
that firing Deputy Conroy

04:37.186 --> 04:38.885
while the affair is
still just alleged...

04:38.921 --> 04:41.054
No, I don't tolerate lying, Frank.

04:41.090 --> 04:42.990
You can just ask my kids, okay?

04:43.025 --> 04:45.159
- So when's the governor announcement?

04:45.194 --> 04:46.994
No idea what you're talking about.

04:47.029 --> 04:48.729
<i>She's the
politician in the family.</i>

04:48.764 --> 04:49.930
When'd you become the shady one?

04:49.965 --> 04:53.000
A long time ago, Paul. I
can take one more question.

04:53.035 --> 04:55.901
- Uh, could you make it brief?
- [Cellphones chiming]

04:55.937 --> 04:57.370
Holy crap.

04:57.405 --> 04:58.605
Mayor Warren!

04:58.640 --> 05:00.273
Have you spoken to the police
about the reappearance of Adam?

05:00.308 --> 05:01.541
Mother!

05:01.576 --> 05:02.642
What?

05:04.912 --> 05:06.146
Grief, wow.

05:06.181 --> 05:09.149
Um, the inevitability of loss.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.650
Life isn't a straight shot, my friends.

05:11.685 --> 05:14.505
It's full of hills and valleys.

05:14.541 --> 05:16.721
Confront your grief,
your... your fear of it,

05:16.757 --> 05:20.159
and you'll take away its power.

05:21.595 --> 05:23.128
Excuse me, folks.

05:24.031 --> 05:25.297
Can I help you?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.133
Hotel guy is at the door.

05:29.169 --> 05:31.235
He says you haven't paid the bill.

05:31.271 --> 05:33.304
  Tell him pay day is Friday.

05:33.339 --> 05:36.106
You have a job? What do you do?

05:36.142 --> 05:37.308
I cash checks.

05:37.343 --> 05:40.278
Oh, my god. They found that boy.

05:40.313 --> 05:41.145
What boy?

05:41.181 --> 05:43.281
The one that was murdered years ago.

05:43.316 --> 05:44.215
The mayor's kid.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.316
Though a
body was never found,

05:46.351 --> 05:47.417
<i>after an extensive investigation,</i>

05:47.452 --> 05:50.187
<i>the warrens' neighbor
was eventually convicted</i>

05:50.222 --> 05:51.421
<i>for Adam's murder.</i>

05:51.456 --> 05:54.691
<i>But sources say the young
man showed up earlier today</i>

05:54.726 --> 05:56.025
<i>to a downtown police precinct</i>

05:56.061 --> 05:59.996
<i>and clearly identified himself
as the youngest Warren child.</i>

06:00.031 --> 06:03.165
<i>He was promptly taken to
City Memorial for evaluation,</i>

06:03.201 --> 06:06.134
<i>and I am told though his
physical condition is weak</i>

06:06.170 --> 06:09.338
<i>and he has sustained several
injuries of unknown nature,</i>

06:09.373 --> 06:11.139
<i>he is now stable.</i>

06:12.876 --> 06:15.277
Where is he? Where is Adam?

06:15.313 --> 06:17.213
I don't know. She wants us
to talk to the doctors first.

06:17.248 --> 06:18.214
Oh, well, screw her.

06:18.249 --> 06:18.980
I want to see my son.

06:19.016 --> 06:20.682
- Bourbon?
- Shut up. Is Dad here?

06:20.717 --> 06:21.949
Yeah, he's getting a flight.

06:21.984 --> 06:24.051
- Where is she?!
- Right here.

06:24.087 --> 06:25.520
I want to know how something
like this gets leaked.

06:25.555 --> 06:27.355
He walked into a busy precinct, Will.

06:27.390 --> 06:29.224
How? How? Where did he come from?

06:29.259 --> 06:31.326
He said that he traveled
for at least 20 miles.

06:31.361 --> 06:33.361
I've got teams in every woods within 50

06:33.396 --> 06:35.463
searching for the bastard that took him.

06:35.498 --> 06:36.383
Does he know who he is?

06:36.419 --> 06:38.298
- Yes.
- How do we know it's him?

06:38.334 --> 06:40.171
It...

06:40.206 --> 06:42.137
It's been 10 years. He
was supposed to be dead.

06:42.172 --> 06:44.404
We ran a DNA test. It's him.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.572
And is he okay?

06:45.608 --> 06:47.974
I mean, what do the doctors say?

06:48.009 --> 06:50.483
He's got some scars. Signs of abuse.

06:51.380 --> 06:52.446
He was kept in shackles.

06:52.481 --> 06:54.413
He took half the skin off
his hand in the escape.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.085
Oh, god.

07:00.121 --> 07:02.154
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.021
All right.

07:03.057 --> 07:05.758
Take a moment, and then shut it down.

07:05.793 --> 07:06.992
Oh. "Shut it down"?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.427
The only thing that's important

07:08.463 --> 07:10.262
is when you walk in
that door, he feels safe.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.364
'Cause I don't know what kind
of hell he's been through,

07:12.399 --> 07:13.231
but it's been a long one.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.403
 Okay.

07:58.276 --> 08:00.408
Hi, Adam.

08:05.416 --> 08:06.948
Hi, Mom.

08:42.884 --> 08:45.284
- Hi.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.821
Hi, my sweet boy.

08:51.326 --> 08:52.591
Welcome home, Ad.

09:07.632 --> 09:13.295
I told him to wait for
me across the street.

09:13.533 --> 09:15.328
You didn't see him
talking to any strangers?

09:15.675 --> 09:16.941
Anyone you didn't recognize?

09:16.978 --> 09:18.734
Ju-just me, the ice cream guy, and Hank.

09:21.697 --> 09:22.877
Who's Hank, Willa?

09:23.110 --> 09:24.510
Just our neighbor.

09:24.545 --> 09:26.345
Right, Mother?

09:27.682 --> 09:29.247
Years ago, there was some sort

09:29.283 --> 09:32.249
of an... indecent-exposure
thing in a park.

09:32.285 --> 09:34.151
"Thing"?! Try conviction!

09:34.187 --> 09:36.053
The man is a sex offender.

09:36.089 --> 09:38.590
The conviction of
my client 10 years ago

09:38.625 --> 09:41.359
was based purely on
circumstantial evidence.

09:41.394 --> 09:44.071
Mr. Asher was bullied
into taking a plea deal

09:44.131 --> 09:45.311
by the police department.

09:45.405 --> 09:47.070
Our city's finest.

09:47.105 --> 09:48.505
So in light of the DNA test

09:48.541 --> 09:50.541
confirming the identity of Adam Warren,

09:50.576 --> 09:52.576
I suspect we can all safely assume

09:52.611 --> 09:54.745
that he wasn't murdered by my client.

09:54.780 --> 09:59.015
I am asking for his immediate
and unconditional release.

09:59.051 --> 10:00.551
Well, I'm going to agree with you,

10:00.586 --> 10:02.781
unless the state has any objections.

10:02.817 --> 10:03.997
 No, Your Honor.

10:04.031 --> 10:04.997
I can go home.

10:05.032 --> 10:06.965
 You can go home.

10:07.001 --> 10:10.635
Mr. Asher, the court
would like to apologize.

10:11.463 --> 10:12.462
 A decade ago,

10:12.497 --> 10:16.432
justice was profoundly
absent from this case.

10:16.468 --> 10:20.369
And therefore, I'd like to
grant you maximum compensation

10:20.405 --> 10:23.271
for wrongful incarceration.

10:23.307 --> 10:26.809
It will be $30,000 a year
for each year that you served.

10:26.844 --> 10:29.678
And with that, the
matter can be adjourned.

10:38.021 --> 10:40.622
Move it back! Thank you very much!

10:40.657 --> 10:42.189
Woman: Mayor Warren!

10:42.225 --> 10:44.692
Mayor Warren! Mayor Warren!

10:47.864 --> 10:50.632
Mayor Warren! Mayor Warren!

10:56.739 --> 10:57.804
Excuse me.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.906
Excuse me. Get out of my way!

10:59.942 --> 11:01.708
- That's my son.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.677
Adam!

11:03.712 --> 11:06.246
Oh, god.

11:06.281 --> 11:07.748
Hey, Dad.

11:07.783 --> 11:10.851
Hi, Chief.

11:14.922 --> 11:16.889
Let's do this inside, John.

11:16.924 --> 11:19.892
  Mayor Warren, are you
happy to have him back home?

11:24.098 --> 11:26.398
  This is a personal family matter.

11:26.433 --> 11:28.900
The mayor will make a statement
when the time is right.

11:28.935 --> 11:30.268
- Thank you.
- All right, vultures.

11:30.303 --> 11:31.870
You got your show. Move it back.

11:31.905 --> 11:34.572
Move it back! Thank you very much!

12:08.085 --> 12:09.585
 I, um...

12:09.974 --> 12:11.941
I took them all down.

12:12.484 --> 12:13.910
The photos of you.

12:13.945 --> 12:15.273
It's just I... I couldn't...

12:15.309 --> 12:16.864
This was so high before.

12:25.989 --> 12:28.289
Do you want to go see your room?

12:29.623 --> 12:31.659
Okay.

12:31.695 --> 12:33.937
We'll just be upstairs.

12:44.721 --> 12:46.807
If we're gonna have a shot at
catching the guy who did this,

12:46.843 --> 12:47.808
I need to question Adam.

12:47.844 --> 12:50.010
It can wait till morning.
The boy just got home.

12:50.046 --> 12:51.578
He knows that Adam's escaped.

12:51.614 --> 12:52.983
He could be on the move.
Every second counts.

12:53.018 --> 12:55.915
I waited 10 years to get my son back.

12:55.951 --> 12:57.516
You can wait one night.

12:57.552 --> 12:59.461
He could have other boys, Claire.

12:59.496 --> 13:01.755
He could be doing
this to other families.

13:07.062 --> 13:09.129
I want the shrink here for this.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.902
You two seem good.

13:19.448 --> 13:20.996
I'm glad you're here.

13:21.021 --> 13:22.289
I came for Adam.

13:31.874 --> 13:33.985
Well, here you go, Hank.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.020
Your aunt Sally and I are real happy

13:36.055 --> 13:38.856
all that ugly business
got straightened out.

13:38.892 --> 13:40.371
Where's my mom?

13:41.013 --> 13:42.138
Oh, boy.

13:45.365 --> 13:47.431
The people there at the facility...

13:47.467 --> 13:49.367
They were supposed to tell you.

13:52.385 --> 13:53.671
She passed, Hank.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.573
'Bout a month ago.

13:55.609 --> 13:58.543
She'd been sick for a long time.

14:01.147 --> 14:02.323
Oh.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.750
Well, they really should have told you.

14:16.028 --> 14:19.194
We were gonna sell the house,
but you can stay for now.

14:22.967 --> 14:24.266
Thank you.

14:25.675 --> 14:28.470
 Tell me about
the man in the woods.

14:28.506 --> 14:29.869
What does he look like?

14:30.269 --> 14:32.057
His skin looks like...

14:32.542 --> 14:34.143
Gravel.

14:34.178 --> 14:36.778
H-he has holes in his face.

14:37.848 --> 14:40.281
What about the place he kept you in?

14:40.316 --> 14:41.883
 Any windows?

14:42.743 --> 14:44.218
Where was the door?

14:44.254 --> 14:46.164
It was up on the ceiling.

14:48.324 --> 14:49.624
Did he ever take you outside?

14:49.660 --> 14:51.325
No.

14:51.361 --> 14:54.094
No. Never? Not... not once?

14:54.129 --> 14:55.596
He came to me.

14:55.631 --> 14:57.631
He always came to me.

15:01.336 --> 15:03.336
<i>Back to our continuing coverage now</i>

15:03.372 --> 15:05.606
<i>of the extraordinary Adam Warren story.</i>

15:05.641 --> 15:07.841
<i>Tonight, Hank Asher... behind bars here</i>

15:07.877 --> 15:10.743
<i>for more than 10 years
for the boy's murder...</i>

15:10.779 --> 15:12.011
<i>Is back at home</i>

15:12.047 --> 15:15.014
<i>after DNA evidence yesterday
confirmed the boy's return.</i>

15:15.050 --> 15:17.684
<i>An emergency hearing
was held this morning,</i>

15:17.719 --> 15:19.686
<i>which declared Asher a free man.</i>

15:19.721 --> 15:21.420
<i>His lawyer tells us tonight</i>

15:21.456 --> 15:24.958
<i>Mr. Asher has no plans to sue
the Red Pines Police Department</i>

15:24.993 --> 15:27.759
<i>despite being wrongly
held for so many years,</i>

15:27.795 --> 15:30.629
<i>which his lawyer calls
extremely generous.</i>

15:30.664 --> 15:34.933
 Sometimes he would forget
to close the door behind him,

15:34.969 --> 15:38.870
and I could see outside
through a window upstairs.

15:38.906 --> 15:41.339
What could you see?

15:42.285 --> 15:43.628
Can I have some more?

15:43.663 --> 15:45.509
Sure, sweetie. In one... one second.

15:45.544 --> 15:46.744
Just... What could you see?

15:48.853 --> 15:50.481
A red dragon.

15:53.013 --> 15:54.380
Okay.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.874
Tell me...

15:56.910 --> 15:59.056
Tell me about that.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.290
The red... red dragon.

16:01.326 --> 16:03.693
I watched it while the
man lied on top of me.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.795
- It was glowing.
- Okay.

16:05.831 --> 16:07.163
It was beautiful.

16:07.198 --> 16:08.564
All right, you can stop this now.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.033
And what was the dragon doing, Adam?

16:10.068 --> 16:11.647
He has been through
enough tonight, Detective.

16:11.682 --> 16:13.440
- We can continue this tomorrow.
- What was the dragon doing, Adam?

16:13.476 --> 16:14.871
The man lied on top of me.

16:14.906 --> 16:16.906
- I said stop this now!
- Every night, he would come...

16:16.942 --> 16:18.140
What was the dragon doing, Adam?

16:18.175 --> 16:19.508
Nina, come on!

16:19.543 --> 16:21.458
He was breathing fire.

16:22.179 --> 16:24.680
Right at me.

16:31.048 --> 16:32.431
Right at me.

16:34.724 --> 16:36.924
I'm gonna get him, okay?

16:40.296 --> 16:42.363
I'm gonna get him.

16:50.097 --> 16:51.881
And why is this all
on me? You're their father!

16:51.962 --> 16:53.295
Danny's drunk!

16:53.331 --> 16:55.815
Willa's becoming a religious nutjob.

16:55.982 --> 16:56.947
Where the hell have you been?

16:56.983 --> 16:58.748
It's not the right
time for a campaign.

16:58.784 --> 16:59.916
Not the right time, not the right time.

16:59.951 --> 17:00.850
When is the right time?

17:00.886 --> 17:02.752
- When he comes back?!
- Don't say... no, no.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.520
- Don't... don't... don't say it!
- He's not coming back!!

17:04.555 --> 17:06.890
Sorry.

17:06.925 --> 17:09.625
I just heard you from back there. I...

17:09.661 --> 17:11.972
The judge denied the
search warrant again.

17:12.066 --> 17:12.680
Oh, great.

17:12.704 --> 17:13.963
Said that there's still
not enough evidence

17:13.997 --> 17:15.792
that Hank Asher had anything
to do with Adam's disappearance.

17:15.829 --> 17:18.191
But... Willa saw them together.

17:18.228 --> 17:19.608
You can't get a search warrant
unless you have evidence,

17:19.631 --> 17:22.369
and you can't get evidence
until you have a search warrant.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.777
Welcome to the justice system.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.789
The low, low price of 10 cents a day,

17:40.821 --> 17:44.452
you, too, could feed a starving child.

17:44.493 --> 17:45.927
Couldn't make it till noon today, champ?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.766
What are you doing?

17:53.802 --> 17:55.936
Ow!

17:55.971 --> 17:57.437
Don't worry. They're still there.

17:57.472 --> 17:58.438
They're like roaches.

17:58.473 --> 18:00.606
While it's lovely to
have you back home again,

18:00.642 --> 18:02.675
could you refrain from
taunting the media?

18:02.711 --> 18:04.344
I still have a job to get back to.

18:04.379 --> 18:05.611
Speaking of which...

18:05.647 --> 18:08.013
I don't think we can stall much longer.

18:08.049 --> 18:10.816
People want to see you
handling this as a mother.

18:10.852 --> 18:12.952
We should book
something... An interview.

18:12.987 --> 18:15.321
This isn't a political
opportunity, Will.

18:15.356 --> 18:16.555
It's our life.

18:16.590 --> 18:19.524
Or at least make a statement,
ideally before the announcement.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.625
What announcement?

18:20.661 --> 18:22.861
We talked about this. John.

18:22.896 --> 18:24.528
Yeah, well, I guess I figured

18:24.564 --> 18:26.197
with everything going on right now,

18:26.233 --> 18:28.666
the... the governor thing
would be off the table.

18:32.538 --> 18:34.505
Well, let's not make any decisions

18:34.540 --> 18:35.907
about anything just now.

18:35.942 --> 18:37.641
We just got our son back.

18:38.278 --> 18:39.510
Can I have some more?

18:39.545 --> 18:41.011
Of course, baby.

18:41.046 --> 18:43.981
You used to hate those. The
smell of them made you sick.

18:45.050 --> 18:46.884
What?

18:46.919 --> 18:48.618
Eggs.

18:54.426 --> 18:56.059
I want bodies
outside the mayor's house,

18:56.095 --> 18:57.994
where she gets her coffee in
the morning, her dry cleaners.

18:58.029 --> 18:58.602
Gus!

18:58.627 --> 19:00.096
Find out what bathroom
she likes to poop in...

19:00.131 --> 19:01.597
- Gus!
- ... and put a body outside of that, too.

19:01.632 --> 19:02.598
What? What do you want?

19:02.633 --> 19:04.733
Lead on the Warren story.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.535
You know every major
national media outlet

19:06.570 --> 19:07.904
is down here covering the story, right?

19:07.939 --> 19:10.539
So what the hell makes you think
that she's gonna want to talk to a...

19:10.574 --> 19:12.708
I don't know, whatever
the hell it is you do here.

19:12.743 --> 19:14.575
Lesbian lifestyle blog.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.945
We have a lesbian lifestyle blog?

19:16.980 --> 19:19.047
We do, and you're right. She won't.

19:19.082 --> 19:20.949
But her son will.

19:44.673 --> 19:46.073
Hi.

19:46.108 --> 19:49.375
I'm... I'm John Warren.

19:49.411 --> 19:50.609
I'm...

19:50.645 --> 19:52.878
I know who you are.

19:52.914 --> 19:55.114
I don't know what to say.

19:56.751 --> 19:59.118
Except that I'm... I'm sorry
for what happened to you.

19:59.154 --> 20:01.120
You're sorry for what happened to me?

20:01.156 --> 20:02.039
Yes, I am.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.496
You happened to me.

20:05.002 --> 20:06.959
Your family happened to me.

20:06.994 --> 20:09.727
Did you want me to forgive you?

20:09.763 --> 20:12.130
This city was a mob.

20:14.335 --> 20:15.800
They were after me.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.171
They were gonna get this
monster no matter what,

20:19.206 --> 20:21.340
and you people lit the torches.

20:21.375 --> 20:22.639
No. Now, wait a minute...

20:22.675 --> 20:24.141
You know what I thought about, John?

20:24.177 --> 20:26.177
When I laid my cell, I
thought about your boy...

20:26.212 --> 20:27.578
Your beautiful little boy.

20:29.548 --> 20:30.914
I wished I did it.

20:30.949 --> 20:33.283
I wished I took him
from you and hurt him,

20:33.319 --> 20:35.152
wrapped my fingers around his throat

20:35.188 --> 20:37.021
and watch the life drip
from his little body,

20:37.056 --> 20:38.022
bit by bit.

20:38.996 --> 20:42.191
So don't feel sorry
about what happened to me.

20:42.226 --> 20:45.094
I didn't spend a minute feeling sorry

20:45.130 --> 20:46.997
for what happened to you.

20:51.236 --> 20:53.436
Price of coffee's not
what it used to be.

21:07.251 --> 21:08.750
 Why didn't you run?

21:11.055 --> 21:13.787
I mean, for 10 years,

21:13.823 --> 21:16.157
some crazy dude had you
locked up in a basement.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.041
He had to bring you
food every day, right?

21:19.077 --> 21:20.061
I mean, he must have messed up

21:20.096 --> 21:22.196
and forgot to lock
the door once or twice.

21:22.232 --> 21:24.165
Why... Why didn't you just...

21:25.123 --> 21:27.135
Why didn't you just run
the first chance you got?

21:27.170 --> 21:29.203
I did.

21:29.239 --> 21:30.841
I ran.

21:31.606 --> 21:33.173
The first chance I got.

21:33.739 --> 21:34.768
When was that?

21:35.746 --> 21:37.044
Yesterday.

21:40.749 --> 21:42.382
I'm... I'm...

21:42.418 --> 21:44.851
I'm sorry, dude.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.153
I was...

21:46.188 --> 21:47.553
Hey, Danny.

21:47.588 --> 21:49.121
How does it get in there?

21:50.850 --> 21:51.984
What?

21:53.213 --> 21:54.549
The ship.

21:57.265 --> 21:58.997
How does it get in there?

22:02.370 --> 22:03.830
What if it's not him?

22:04.176 --> 22:06.504
I know. I know that sounds
crazy, and maybe it is.

22:06.540 --> 22:08.906
But he is... different, okay?

22:08.942 --> 22:10.675
From the moment I saw
him at the hospital,

22:10.710 --> 22:12.975
there's just been
something off about him.

22:13.713 --> 22:15.046
H-he's different.

22:15.082 --> 22:17.449
- Are you drunk?
- No, no.

22:17.484 --> 22:18.616
Just listen to me, because...

22:18.651 --> 22:22.252
Adam's different because
he's not 9 years old anymore,

22:22.288 --> 22:23.853
because he eats eggs.

22:23.889 --> 22:25.255
Uh, the... the ships!

22:25.291 --> 22:26.423
In the bottles?

22:26.459 --> 22:28.959
He doesn't remember that you
have to collapse the mast.

22:28.994 --> 22:30.026
That's all he did!

22:30.062 --> 22:32.229
It was all he cared about.
How could he forget that?

22:32.264 --> 22:34.198
Maybe it was the decade
of rape and torture.

22:34.233 --> 22:35.199
Willa...

22:35.234 --> 22:37.234
They did a DNA test,
you worthless piece of...

22:37.269 --> 22:38.601
That's enough!

22:49.347 --> 22:51.280
You are my son...

22:51.316 --> 22:53.876
And I will always love you.

22:54.519 --> 22:58.086
But you... are a drunk, honey.

22:58.122 --> 23:01.658
And it's my fault for
cleaning up after you.

23:01.693 --> 23:04.759
But... you are just a drunk.

23:05.404 --> 23:06.393
Mom...

23:06.430 --> 23:09.895
Yeah, you're a drunk,
and you are confused.

23:11.301 --> 23:18.894
So don't ever, ever say
anything like that again.

23:23.270 --> 23:24.177
Okay.

23:24.213 --> 23:25.146
Here we go.

23:25.181 --> 23:27.879
Honey, can you pull
up the calendar for me?

23:30.152 --> 23:32.152
<i>And what was the
dragon doing, Adam?</i>

23:32.187 --> 23:34.787
<i>- The man lied on top of me...
- The dragon. Where was the door?</i>

23:34.822 --> 23:36.289
<i>It was up on the ceiling.</i>

23:36.324 --> 23:38.124
<i> His skin looks like gravel.</i>

23:38.160 --> 23:39.626
<i>He has holes in his face.</i>

23:39.661 --> 23:41.494
<i>What was the dragon doing, Adam?</i>

23:44.899 --> 23:46.132
Holy crap.

23:49.236 --> 23:50.369
A red dragon.

23:50.404 --> 23:53.172
He was breathing fire. Right at me.

26:43.969 --> 26:47.137
It's the sunset hitting
the northern mountain range,

26:47.173 --> 26:48.238
turning it red.

26:48.273 --> 26:51.041
That's our red dragon,
and for it to breathe fire,

26:51.077 --> 26:53.177
oil refinery right behind it.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.145
- So the guy's cabin in the woods...
- Well, from the cabin,

26:55.181 --> 26:58.015
for it to seem like it was
breathing smoke from the head,

26:58.050 --> 27:00.482
it could be anywhere
from here down to here,

27:00.518 --> 27:02.618
and given line of sight on a clear day,

27:02.653 --> 27:04.153
it might go back four miles.

27:04.189 --> 27:07.890
So all deep woods, hardly
populated, perfect cover.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.892
This is our search area.

27:09.928 --> 27:11.160
Get a team together and let's move.

27:11.196 --> 27:12.294
Got it.

27:18.035 --> 27:20.001
I never should have taken these down.

27:21.071 --> 27:22.296
I gave up.

27:22.768 --> 27:25.338
Well, we all did.

27:25.635 --> 27:26.468
Mm.

27:26.777 --> 27:31.213
But I gave up on more than just him.

27:44.426 --> 27:46.560
I won't run.

27:48.264 --> 27:50.253
I don't need to be governor.

27:58.907 --> 28:00.361
Oh, god.

28:01.209 --> 28:02.645
I am so sorry.

28:04.445 --> 28:06.909
Are you?

28:07.447 --> 28:09.248
Well, come on, I didn't
know he was there.

28:10.284 --> 28:11.216
Oh, please. Come on.

28:11.252 --> 28:12.851
You... you got a sixth sense.

28:12.887 --> 28:13.925
Don't... That's not fair!

28:13.950 --> 28:17.355
Hey, I-I get it.
Adam won you City Council.

28:17.391 --> 28:19.224
Why not governor this time
around? Even president.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.593
"Mayor puts family back
together"? It's gold!

28:21.628 --> 28:23.395
Like you didn't do the same thing.

28:23.430 --> 28:25.729
You didn't write a book, John.

28:25.765 --> 28:27.210
You hatched an escape plan.

28:27.246 --> 28:30.367
<i>Do you think I wanted to be on tour?</i>

28:30.403 --> 28:32.730
Living out of suitcases?

28:32.766 --> 28:34.939
Eating crap hotel food?

28:34.974 --> 28:37.208
I don't know. It's a good thing
you weren't too lonely doing it.

28:42.014 --> 28:45.648
Oh, honey. Honey, please, please.

28:45.684 --> 28:47.650
Wherever you're going
right now, I'm just...

28:47.686 --> 28:48.952
I am asking you not to.

29:00.698 --> 29:02.298
Can you just bring the bottle?

29:02.333 --> 29:03.098
 Come on, baby.

29:03.134 --> 29:04.352
Let me... let me get your number.

29:04.387 --> 29:05.959
Are you deaf and dumb?

29:05.994 --> 29:08.025
- I told you I'm with someone.
- Yeah?

29:08.060 --> 29:09.771
Who?

29:09.807 --> 29:11.240
Him.

29:12.509 --> 29:15.176
You haven't even talked to that guy.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.878
Come on, man.

29:24.027 --> 29:25.786
We don't do a lot of talking.

29:27.290 --> 29:28.146
Shut up.

29:28.181 --> 29:30.225
Man: Mm, mm, mm.

29:30.260 --> 29:31.826
Desperate times. Sorry.

29:31.861 --> 29:34.022
Uh, no. I am happy to help.

29:34.057 --> 29:35.329
Oh, my god.

29:35.364 --> 29:37.331
Danny, you don't recognize me?

29:37.366 --> 29:39.399
Should I?

29:39.434 --> 29:40.868
Bridey Cruz. High school.

29:42.338 --> 29:45.339
Wow.

29:45.374 --> 29:47.674
Yeah, uh, of course.

29:47.709 --> 29:49.041
I'm sorry.

29:49.077 --> 29:50.343
Hey, I watch the news.

29:50.378 --> 29:52.178
You got a lot on your plate right now.

29:54.548 --> 29:57.383
So how is he... your brother?

29:57.418 --> 29:59.352
Uh, he's good. He's good, you know.

29:59.387 --> 30:00.586
I mean, he's got scars,

30:00.621 --> 30:02.621
and it's gonna take a while, but...

30:06.026 --> 30:08.659
Me and my sister were
supposed to be watching him.

30:08.695 --> 30:11.562
I remember.

30:12.632 --> 30:14.766
I was there.

30:17.237 --> 30:19.104
Yeah.

30:21.835 --> 30:23.901
So I guess we all got 'em.

30:24.410 --> 30:26.043
Hmm?

30:28.414 --> 30:30.072
Scars.

31:42.217 --> 31:43.822
<i>Make a wish! Make a wish!</i>

31:43.847 --> 31:45.198
<i>Blow out the candles!</i>

31:45.233 --> 31:46.765
<i>Yay!</i>

31:46.800 --> 31:48.320
<i>I want a big piece.</i>

31:48.356 --> 31:49.547
<i>I want the frosting.</i>

31:49.607 --> 31:50.973
<i>Okay, you got it.</i>

31:52.443 --> 31:53.576
<i>Yay!</i>

31:53.611 --> 31:54.577
<i>I want a big piece!</i>

31:54.612 --> 31:55.678
<i>I want the frosting!</i>

31:55.714 --> 31:56.512
<i>Oka... </i>

31:58.783 --> 32:01.417
Forgive me, father, for I have sinned.

32:12.963 --> 32:14.229
Police!

32:14.264 --> 32:17.032
On your knees, on your knees!

32:18.468 --> 32:21.203
Thought you said it was legal now!

32:21.238 --> 32:23.037
What the... ?

32:26.575 --> 32:30.044
It has been six days
since my last confession.

32:32.081 --> 32:33.280
And...

32:33.315 --> 32:39.485
10 years since my last true confession.

32:41.123 --> 32:42.756
<i>Make a wish! Make a wish!</i>

32:42.791 --> 32:44.224
<i>Blow out the candles!</i>

32:44.259 --> 32:45.424
<i>Yay!</i>

32:45.460 --> 32:46.860
<i>I want a big piece!</i>

32:46.895 --> 32:48.094
<i>I want the frosting!</i>

32:48.130 --> 32:50.096
<i>Okay, you got it. Happy birthday.</i>

32:50.132 --> 32:51.564
<i>Happy birth...</i>

32:53.635 --> 32:55.235
<i>Yay!</i>

32:55.270 --> 32:56.902
<i>I want a big piece!</i>

32:56.937 --> 32:58.237
<i>I want the frosting!</i>

32:58.272 --> 33:00.773
I want a big piece.

33:00.808 --> 33:03.108
I want the frosting.

33:03.144 --> 33:04.810
<i>All right.</i>

33:07.143 --> 33:08.609
I didn't take that little boy's ship.

33:08.645 --> 33:10.592
I don't even know how it got there.

33:11.646 --> 33:12.545
Here's what I think, Hank.

33:12.580 --> 33:14.938
Just 'cause someone does something bad,

33:15.066 --> 33:16.565
it doesn't make them a bad person.

33:16.601 --> 33:19.690
But, see, if this thing goes to trial,

33:19.715 --> 33:21.536
the jury's not gonna see it like me.

33:21.571 --> 33:22.748
Because first, they're gonna hear

33:22.773 --> 33:23.793
about what you did in that park.

33:23.853 --> 33:24.985
That was years ago.

33:25.020 --> 33:27.020
I took my lump for that. I paid a fine.

33:27.056 --> 33:27.821
I registered.

33:27.857 --> 33:29.756
And then they're gonna see this.

33:33.349 --> 33:34.484
What's that?

33:34.509 --> 33:35.762
Your computer.

33:37.477 --> 33:38.758
Want to watch?

33:46.413 --> 33:47.580
Turn it off.

33:47.767 --> 33:48.945
You're the one that likes it.

33:49.592 --> 33:50.518
I just want to know why.

33:50.598 --> 33:51.690
Please turn it off.

33:51.715 --> 33:53.037
Is it because they're
so little and helpless?

33:53.072 --> 33:54.268
Turn it off!

33:57.588 --> 33:59.916
I look at that stuff.

34:00.058 --> 34:02.082
I don't act on it.

34:03.884 --> 34:06.017
I just look at it.

34:06.051 --> 34:07.817
I believe you.

34:07.853 --> 34:08.818
Do you?

34:08.853 --> 34:10.186
But, see, a jury...

34:10.221 --> 34:12.154
They're not gonna see it like me.

34:12.188 --> 34:14.657
They're just gonna see a
monster that likes little boys.

34:14.692 --> 34:17.103
Little boys like Adam Warren.

34:17.862 --> 34:19.364
You didn't mean to kill him.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.129
- Sometimes, things just get out of hand.
- No.

34:21.165 --> 34:23.498
And that's why you cleaned the
garage... To get rid of his blood.

34:23.534 --> 34:25.266
- But you kept his toy to think about it.
- No.

34:25.302 --> 34:26.569
Remember what you did.

34:26.603 --> 34:27.842
- Dream about it.
- No.

34:27.877 --> 34:29.003
Hank, it's not your fault.

34:29.039 --> 34:30.368
You were born this way.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.574
It's like having straight hair or curly.

34:33.610 --> 34:35.208
Blue eyes or freckles.

34:35.244 --> 34:36.878
You can't help the way you were born.

34:36.913 --> 34:38.812
I don't want to be like this.

34:39.916 --> 34:41.552
I can help you.

34:42.886 --> 34:43.851
I can help.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.840
If you just tell me
what you did to Adam.

34:47.730 --> 34:51.331
I won't let them make you their monster.

34:55.464 --> 34:57.798
They're gonna sentence you to death.

34:57.833 --> 35:00.901
Wipe you away, like a stain.

35:00.936 --> 35:01.968
Oh, god.

35:02.003 --> 35:02.902
No, Hank.

35:02.937 --> 35:04.136
There's no god.

35:04.171 --> 35:06.739
'Cause if there was, why would
he make something like you?

35:06.774 --> 35:09.075
- Please...
- There's only me.

35:09.110 --> 35:11.143
I'm the only one that can save you now.

35:12.172 --> 35:14.947
So, tell me about Adam.

35:16.017 --> 35:16.916
Hmm?

35:17.907 --> 35:20.551
Tell me what you did to him.

35:41.992 --> 35:43.280
That bad, huh?

35:44.842 --> 35:46.966
What are you doing here?

35:48.823 --> 35:49.947
I want to help.

35:51.684 --> 35:53.757
Go home, John.

35:53.792 --> 35:55.785
To your son and your wife.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.392
Do you think I have them back now?

35:57.889 --> 35:58.683
John...

35:58.719 --> 36:00.322
I don't have my son back.

36:00.358 --> 36:01.633
Not the sweet little boy

36:01.668 --> 36:05.386
I took my eye off for one damn second.

36:06.031 --> 36:06.896
And my wife?

36:06.931 --> 36:08.667
I'm married to a machine, not a wife.

36:08.774 --> 36:10.372
<i>So the only thing I can do now...</i>

36:10.408 --> 36:12.775
'Cause I sure as hell
can't sleep anymore...

36:12.811 --> 36:15.210
is help you find the
monster who did this to us.

36:15.246 --> 36:16.828
You want to know who
wrecked your family?

36:16.853 --> 36:17.814
So just tell me right now...

36:17.849 --> 36:19.649
- You want to know who the monster is?
- ... how I can help.

36:19.684 --> 36:22.251
<i>I'm the monster.</i>

36:22.286 --> 36:25.254
I'm the one who had it
all figured out at 25

36:25.289 --> 36:27.155
and looked you in the eye

36:27.190 --> 36:28.723
and told you that your son was dead.

36:28.759 --> 36:31.924
Every scar on that kid's
body... It wasn't the bogeyman.

36:31.949 --> 36:33.227
It was me.

36:33.971 --> 36:37.432
I'm the one who stopped
looking and got promoted for it.

36:37.907 --> 36:40.068
So blame me.

36:42.002 --> 36:42.904
Hate me.

36:42.940 --> 36:45.835
Because I'm the one who
didn't save your son.

36:49.979 --> 36:53.647
No. You didn't.

36:57.954 --> 36:59.874
<i>But you saved me.</i>

37:36.303 --> 37:37.603
Where's Dad?

37:37.638 --> 37:41.507
Oh, um, honey, he'll be back soon.

37:41.543 --> 37:43.443
Um, come here.

37:43.478 --> 37:44.511
Let me.

37:44.546 --> 37:46.012
Okay?

37:46.047 --> 37:47.669
Let's see.

37:47.694 --> 37:49.767
Under like this first.

37:50.740 --> 37:52.060
Pull it through.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.207
Better not tell Dad we're doing this.

37:57.374 --> 37:59.742
He's gonna want to teach you himself.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.577
Okay. Okay.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.913
Great.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.520
Put your collar down.

38:14.196 --> 38:15.495
See?

38:16.664 --> 38:18.093
That's a Windsor knot.

38:18.902 --> 38:20.228
 Good morning.

38:20.263 --> 38:21.530
I'll keep this brief.

38:22.034 --> 38:25.566
Let me first begin by thanking
the people of Red Pines

38:25.602 --> 38:27.667
for their overwhelming support.

38:27.703 --> 38:30.570
The medical staff at City Memorial,

38:30.606 --> 38:34.108
everyone at the mayor's
office, and the media,

38:34.143 --> 38:37.111
for allowing us a moment to breathe

38:37.146 --> 38:39.742
and begin the healing process.

38:39.777 --> 38:40.469
Uh...

38:40.494 --> 38:43.359
Family has always been
paramount to who I am

38:43.395 --> 38:45.517
and what I stand for.

38:45.553 --> 38:47.722
And mine got a happy ending.

38:48.222 --> 38:52.689
But we are the exception and
not the rule in this country.

38:54.095 --> 38:55.657
Now more than ever,

38:56.097 --> 38:59.417
I want to strengthen our
child-protection laws,

38:59.611 --> 39:02.196
increase sex-offender monitoring,

39:03.237 --> 39:08.567
fund more programs like AMBER
Alert to protect our children.

39:11.078 --> 39:12.077
To stop the nightmare

39:12.112 --> 39:14.874
that we've been living
for the past 10 years...

39:15.960 --> 39:17.382
From happening...

39:18.587 --> 39:23.949
To other good American families.

39:28.535 --> 39:32.498
So, that is why today, with
the support of my family,

39:32.534 --> 39:36.568
I am announcing my candidacy

39:36.604 --> 39:40.439
for governor of our
great state of Maine.

39:41.775 --> 39:46.378
Not for me, but for my Adam

39:46.413 --> 39:51.415
and for all the other Adams
who are still out there!

40:10.235 --> 40:13.136
We're getting smoked by
every other paper in the country,

40:13.171 --> 40:15.538
like it's their story to tell.

40:15.574 --> 40:17.974
Don't believe everything you read.

40:18.009 --> 40:20.109
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

40:20.145 --> 40:21.611
The doctor at City Memorial

40:21.647 --> 40:23.580
who verified Adam Warren's DNA test.

40:23.615 --> 40:24.446
Mm-hmm?

40:24.482 --> 40:27.783
I called him this morning for comment.

40:27.818 --> 40:29.217
And?

40:29.253 --> 40:31.320
He doesn't exist.

40:34.825 --> 40:36.954
This is our story.

40:37.709 --> 40:39.928
And there's a hell of a lot more to it.

40:50.153 --> 40:51.385
Meyer?

40:51.421 --> 40:53.212
You okay?

40:53.247 --> 40:54.860
Kid's little ship.

40:54.896 --> 40:57.765
Forensics pulled the pedo's
prints off it 10 years ago.

40:57.801 --> 40:58.602
So?

40:58.627 --> 41:00.642
Nina: So that's all they got.

41:00.677 --> 41:02.901
The kid's prints were never on it.

41:02.937 --> 41:04.459
Seems odd, right?

41:04.494 --> 41:06.619
Since he was seen carrying
it around that night.

41:07.895 --> 41:08.960
Unless...

41:08.996 --> 41:14.666
Someone put it in there and
cleaned it for me to find.

41:18.037 --> 41:20.905
<i> They say
every cop has two...</i>

41:20.940 --> 41:23.106
<i>The case that breaks you... </i>

41:24.710 --> 41:26.710
<i>... and the one that makes you.</i>

41:30.282 --> 41:31.081
Oh, gosh.

41:31.116 --> 41:32.749
I've been praying for that family.

41:32.784 --> 41:33.842
They have a long road ahead.

41:33.877 --> 41:35.274
They sure do, ma'am.

41:35.310 --> 41:37.086
They sure do.
