00:01.560 --> 00:04.119
Two traffic officers
were first at the scene.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.729
<i>They found three bodies -</i>

00:05.730 --> 00:07.699
two young women
and an elderly man.

00:07.700 --> 00:10.949
<i>Another body's since been
found in a burnt out four-by-four.</i>

00:10.950 --> 00:13.450
- Hello, Bluebell.
- Get away from her!

00:14.760 --> 00:16.309
My father...

00:16.309 --> 00:18.279
He's the one to blame.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.499
<i>- Mel has gone to the hospital.</i>
- Is she OK?

00:20.500 --> 00:23.009
- She's been shot.
- Has she said anything?

00:23.010 --> 00:25.449
It was Andy.
<i>He's on the run.</i>

00:25.450 --> 00:27.579
One of the lorries is
unaccounted for.

00:27.580 --> 00:29.399
Right, and I bet I know who's got that.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.259
Apart from finding out
where Andy is,

00:31.260 --> 00:34.459
<i>identifying who
he was with is our main priority.</i>

00:34.460 --> 00:36.779
- Any idea who this is?
- Yeah, we've got him.

00:36.780 --> 00:38.209
Michael Adams.

00:38.210 --> 00:40.899
Listen, I can only give you
24 hours on this, OK?

00:40.900 --> 00:43.299
<i>The gun you found under the dead
man's car seat,</i>

00:43.300 --> 00:45.399
- it's not been sent over.
- It's evidence.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.189
<i>Evidence that the gun
is police issue.</i>

00:48.190 --> 00:50.389
<i>This is all wrong,</i>
Clarissa.

00:50.390 --> 00:52.500
All wrong.

02:23.580 --> 02:25.960
When were you last
at Orchard House?

02:27.380 --> 02:29.390
I've not seen Andy in weeks.

02:30.140 --> 02:33.759
He took out one of the articulated
lorries on the 18th.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.169
He couldn't afford to pay anyone,

02:35.170 --> 02:37.379
so probably ended up
doing a few jobs himself.

02:37.380 --> 02:40.130
The lorry wasn't
returned to the depot.

02:40.980 --> 02:45.090
Just like Andy to escape in a lorry
with his name all over the side of it.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.980
We've got some evidence that he
was...

02:49.340 --> 02:51.900
with someone on Christmas Eve.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.739
Who?

02:54.740 --> 02:56.500
They're investigating.

03:00.780 --> 03:04.859
You know what Andy's like -
women, men, you name it.

03:04.860 --> 03:06.389
It's one of the reasons I left him.

03:06.390 --> 03:08.359
Do you have any idea
who that might have been?

03:08.360 --> 03:11.550
- You think they were responsible for what happened?
- We don't know yet, but...

03:12.540 --> 03:15.219
Laurence...

03:15.220 --> 03:17.750
why am I here? Why are you telling
me this?

03:18.660 --> 03:21.060
Is there something
you need to tell me?

03:22.900 --> 03:25.939
According to Stevie's diaries, you
and her weren't speaking to each other...

03:25.940 --> 03:29.100
- You clearly don't have teenage kids.
- Zoe...

03:29.900 --> 03:32.999
You think I could
murder my own daughter?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.309
Andy? Sure.

03:34.310 --> 03:37.450
His old man? Absolutely
no problem, but the girls?

03:38.300 --> 03:41.280
You think I could point
a gun at them, and...

03:50.020 --> 03:53.740
If you'll excuse me,
my daughter needs me.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.019
<i>What time were you back?</i>

04:07.020 --> 04:08.829
<i>I'm a teenager all over again.</i>

04:08.830 --> 04:10.700
Just asking.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.620
How was the Red Lion?

04:17.180 --> 04:19.050
You made the paper.

04:23.590 --> 04:25.749
There we all were,
eating our Christmas lunch

04:25.750 --> 04:27.050
and there was you...

04:27.900 --> 04:29.600
<i>A whole family.</i>

04:30.140 --> 04:32.240
<i>And we think
we've got problems.</i>

04:33.820 --> 04:35.380
Did you see Ryan?

04:36.660 --> 04:40.240
I thought he might have called,
but it's not easy for him.

04:47.460 --> 04:50.259
People were asking where you were,
but I didn't tell them.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.700
<i>I didn't want to put them
off their Christmas pudding.</i>

04:54.740 --> 04:56.530
<i>To tell you the truth,
I...</i>

04:57.240 --> 04:58.759
<i>don't know how you do it.</i>

04:58.760 --> 05:00.369
<i>I couldn't do what you do.</i>

05:00.370 --> 05:01.820
<i>I doubt many could.</i>

05:03.820 --> 05:06.929
Are you coming back, or...
was that Christmas?

05:06.930 --> 05:09.180
Of course I'm coming back.
I said so, didn't I?

05:15.540 --> 05:18.160
I'm proud of you, son.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.959
I thought Nikki was going
to be here?

05:43.960 --> 05:45.719
She's doing Jack's job,

05:45.720 --> 05:47.759
had to be done first thing.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.670
Yeah, and where's Jack?

05:50.010 --> 05:52.219
He had to go to his dad's last
night,

05:52.220 --> 05:54.969
and he wanted to talk to the DCI
about the gun

05:54.970 --> 05:57.039
- that still hasn't arrived.
- Really?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.499
What about the sim card?

05:58.500 --> 06:00.779
He's going to ask about that, too.

06:00.780 --> 06:03.339
I thought they wanted us to look
at the body from the four-by-four.

06:03.340 --> 06:05.839
The DI said it's on its way.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.399
Right.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.010
Well, Martin McMorris it is, then.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.600
Postmortem.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.230
December 26th, 8Âªm.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.060
Mum.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.169
- Hello, love.
- Mum...

06:56.170 --> 06:58.900
It's all right. You don't have
to do anything.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.260
It's all over now, Mel.

07:04.740 --> 07:07.099
Everything is going to be fine.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.320
No-one can get to us here.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.579
Have you got them yet?

07:14.580 --> 07:16.659
Looks like a heel.

07:16.660 --> 07:18.389
<i>Boot of some kind?</i>

07:18.390 --> 07:20.710
I'm checking the database.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.190
Look at this.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.509
Did you ever keep a diary?

07:25.510 --> 07:27.999
Every January I started one,
but then...

07:28.000 --> 07:30.709
Mine was full of the most
desperate angst,

07:30.710 --> 07:32.559
<i>most of it made up.</i>

07:32.560 --> 07:34.729
- Are you reading Stevie's diary?
- Well, I'm trying to.

07:34.730 --> 07:37.509
Not only is her handwriting
indecipherable,

07:37.510 --> 07:39.529
it's full of drawings
and symbols

07:39.530 --> 07:41.300
that could mean anything.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.979
But I don't think "M",

07:43.980 --> 07:46.069
<i>the letter on the gift tag,</i>

07:46.070 --> 07:47.379
<i>means Melanie,</i>

07:47.380 --> 07:49.410
cos I've found this entry.

07:52.260 --> 07:55.100
"Must tell Mel the truth about M."

07:55.530 --> 07:57.199
Did you get this tyre mark?

07:57.200 --> 07:59.779
<i>It's a...</i>
a bike?

07:59.780 --> 08:01.309
- No.
<i>- A scooter?</i>

08:01.310 --> 08:04.100
Motorbike?
Wheelbarrow?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.979
Still no sign of Andy
or the Arctic.

08:07.980 --> 08:10.839
And the gun. You assured me
you'd sent it to the Lyell.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.949
- Don't worry, I've still got it.
- Why?

08:12.950 --> 08:16.099
Yesterday morning, I was called
by my Chief Superintendent.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.769
Apparently, there's an ongoing
classified operation

08:18.770 --> 08:20.929
that supersedes this investigation.

08:20.930 --> 08:23.999
- What?
- I was urged to hold on to the gun,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.469
and hold off examining the
four-by-four, and the body inside.

08:27.470 --> 08:30.199
Were you also urged
to remove the SIM card

08:30.200 --> 08:32.619
- from the phone we found?
- I don't know what you're talking about,

08:32.620 --> 08:35.818
and, frankly, Jack,
I resent that implication.

08:35.820 --> 08:39.419
There's a photo in there of the two
of you cosying up

08:39.419 --> 08:41.659
at a clay pigeon shooting event.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.429
I get to meet a lot of people

08:43.429 --> 08:46.049
in my new role as Detective
Chief Inspector.

08:46.050 --> 08:47.629
- All right.
- Yeah, I knew who Andy was,

08:47.630 --> 08:50.139
and I knew he'd been on trial
for murder, he wasn't convicted -

08:50.140 --> 08:51.799
in my opinion,
he was a good man

08:51.800 --> 08:53.789
until proven otherwise and, besides,

08:53.790 --> 08:56.499
you can get information
from a phone without the SIM.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.810
The phone was seriously
damaged by the fire.

08:59.140 --> 09:00.699
The serial number's illegible,

09:00.700 --> 09:02.509
so we don't know who the
service provider was,

09:02.510 --> 09:04.220
and without that SIM card...

09:04.860 --> 09:07.349
What about Andy's service provider?

09:07.350 --> 09:09.299
Any information from them?

09:09.300 --> 09:13.379
No calls or messages
between the 18th and the 23rd,

09:13.380 --> 09:16.029
but then quite a few
to a number,

09:16.030 --> 09:18.409
which could possibly belong to a
burner phone -

09:18.410 --> 09:21.969
the type used by undercover
police officers.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.479
All right, Jack,

09:23.480 --> 09:25.799
- I'm as frustrated as you are...
- Are you?

09:25.800 --> 09:28.259
..but let me assure you,
I will not rest

09:28.260 --> 09:31.859
until I've ascertained the truth
of what's happened round here.

09:31.860 --> 09:34.070
- OK?
- OK.

09:36.460 --> 09:40.129
Apart from the gunshot wounds, there
are indications that the deceased

09:40.130 --> 09:42.390
sustained a number of heavy blows.

09:42.980 --> 09:46.979
We've got severe bruising,
right across the body,

09:46.980 --> 09:49.079
deffused red in colour.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.930
Two classic entry wounds to the
chest.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.819
Stippling around
the margin of the wounds

09:55.820 --> 09:57.629
where there are burn marks

09:57.630 --> 09:59.389
and some slight tears.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.109
I would estimate that the distance
from which he was shot...

10:02.110 --> 10:03.410
..was point blank range.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.339
Point blank range.

10:08.340 --> 10:11.629
The tissue samples taken from under
Martin McMorris' ring?

10:11.630 --> 10:13.179
Yeah, what about them?

10:13.180 --> 10:16.190
It wasn't father fighting son
as we suspected.

10:17.340 --> 10:18.940
It was Martin,

10:19.380 --> 10:22.380
but with a man named Vernon Rye.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.540
Please don't, Mr. Rye.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.929
I've already seen four bodies
riddled with bullets

11:01.930 --> 11:05.260
this Christmas holiday,
let's not make it a fifth.

11:12.540 --> 11:16.580
Hey, you be careful in there.
It's all I've got.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.900
That your bike, is it?

11:21.100 --> 11:23.469
You're all here
cos I nicked a bike?

11:23.470 --> 11:26.079
I knew things had changed
this last nine years,

11:26.080 --> 11:28.340
- but isn't this a bit over the top?
- Get moving.

12:23.060 --> 12:25.939
The boots are Wellingtons,

12:25.940 --> 12:28.649
size seven or eight...

12:28.650 --> 12:30.089
There are some at the house.

12:30.090 --> 12:32.779
<i>And Jack found a pair</i>
in Vernon Rye's caravan.

12:32.780 --> 12:35.829
He also has a bike <i>and a
motive for being there.</i>

12:35.830 --> 12:37.569
Why would he have come down here?

12:37.570 --> 12:39.659
Maybe we're missing something.

12:39.660 --> 12:41.100
Morning.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.359
Morning.
Any news on DI Gibbs?

12:45.360 --> 12:47.980
She's still in a critical
condition, I'm afraid.

12:48.660 --> 12:51.259
I was wondering when the lake was
going to be searched.

12:51.260 --> 12:52.569
Soon, I hope.

12:52.570 --> 12:55.539
We're prioritising our resources
into the search for Andy.

12:55.540 --> 12:58.600
It seems that Christmas has
slowed everything down.

13:00.620 --> 13:04.089
I understand you've offered to take
some things over to Mel.

13:04.090 --> 13:06.039
- Yes.
- Would you do that now?

13:06.040 --> 13:07.609
I'm going over there.
She's awake.

13:07.610 --> 13:09.589
- Of course.
- I'd like you to come with me.

13:09.590 --> 13:13.259
- What for? I...
- We have a suspect in custody

13:13.260 --> 13:16.249
who I think Mel may well
be able to identify.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.269
- I don't know, I...
- Dr. Alexander,

13:18.270 --> 13:20.009
she trusts you.

13:20.010 --> 13:21.770
You saved her life.

13:22.380 --> 13:23.680
Please.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.719
Pyjamas and knickers, <i>I mean,
that's what I'D want.</i>

13:51.720 --> 13:53.020
Yeah.

14:05.380 --> 14:08.659
Rimonabant?
<i>They help release serotonin.</i>

14:08.660 --> 14:10.069
<i>They're illegal.</i>

14:10.070 --> 14:12.059
To suppress the appetite.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.809
Very popular amongst teenagers,

14:13.810 --> 14:15.979
but the side effects are awful.

14:15.980 --> 14:19.500
Perhaps she needed to keep her
weight down for riding.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.609
<i>Dr. Alexander?</i>

14:22.610 --> 14:24.300
Coming.

14:32.060 --> 14:34.020
Is this about the other night?

14:36.820 --> 14:39.459
I can't believe Martin.

14:39.460 --> 14:42.739
I never thought he'd be one to grass
me up.

14:42.740 --> 14:44.169
How do you know Martin?

14:44.170 --> 14:47.460
He used to run a scaffolding yard,
I did some jobs for him.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.169
You again.

14:50.170 --> 14:52.789
Mr. Hodgson just wants to take
a few samples from you.

14:52.790 --> 14:55.310
A few swabs is all.
Will that be OK?

14:57.020 --> 14:59.459
Were you wearing these
on Christmas Eve?

14:59.460 --> 15:01.630
Don't have much else.

15:03.940 --> 15:05.940
This is not about some
punch-up, is it?

15:09.220 --> 15:12.460
Martin McMorris was found shot
dead on Christmas morning.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.219
Holy shit!
And you think it was ME?

15:16.220 --> 15:18.060
- Was it?
- No way!

15:18.780 --> 15:20.080
I just wanted me money.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.830
Me and Martin, we're mates.

15:25.180 --> 15:27.059
You're looking for gunshot residue.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.699
You know the drill.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.559
It's how they nailed me last time.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.379
If you didn't fire a gun,
there'll be no residue.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.850
Nothing to worry about.
Roll your sleeves up.

15:43.940 --> 15:46.179
Where did the fight take place,
Vernon?

15:46.180 --> 15:47.840
Back of the King and Queen.

15:48.460 --> 15:49.819
Any witnesses?

15:49.820 --> 15:51.819
Don't know.
We were off our tits.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.810
What was it about?
Relax your hand.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.579
What are fights usually about?

15:56.580 --> 15:59.500
Women, money, football.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.369
I served time for that man and
he owes me, big time,

16:03.370 --> 16:06.730
but he's all, "Money's all gone
and it's backs to the wall".

16:07.540 --> 16:09.399
And I take him outside

16:09.400 --> 16:12.950
and I let him know what it's really
like to have your back to the wall.

16:13.850 --> 16:17.139
Then he tells me he can get
the money off his son Andy

16:17.140 --> 16:18.449
who's loaded

16:18.450 --> 16:20.559
and he shows me pictures
of Andy's house.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.480
I mean,
have you seen it?!

16:25.380 --> 16:27.539
Look, when I last saw Martin,

16:27.540 --> 16:31.459
he was getting in a cab singing
Rudolph the red pissed reindeer.

16:31.460 --> 16:33.309
- Did you follow him?
- On me bike, you mean?

16:33.310 --> 16:36.020
- Did you follow him to Orchard House?
- No, I didn't!

16:38.980 --> 16:42.500
And you better prove I didn't.

16:43.860 --> 16:45.789
Were you with Bluebell
when she...?

16:45.790 --> 16:49.659
I did my best to make her
as comfortable as possible.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.410
You used to have a horse.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.310
You remember me saying that?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.480
You were upset.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.320
Do you remember anything else, Mel?

17:02.540 --> 17:05.459
He has a photo
he wants you to look at.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.480
Do you recognise that man?

17:09.420 --> 17:10.839
Are you sure?

17:10.839 --> 17:15.319
We have evidence he
was fighting your grandfather.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.240
No.

17:18.780 --> 17:21.079
Grandad was fighting with Dad.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.520
Shouting and screaming.

17:32.340 --> 17:35.470
Me and Stevie and Gabrielle came
back from church

17:35.980 --> 17:38.760
and Grandad was off his face...

17:39.700 --> 17:42.430
..knocking stuff off the dining room
table

17:43.540 --> 17:45.940
and Dad was white with anger.

17:47.740 --> 17:49.590
I went upstairs to my room.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.300
Best out of the way when he gets
like that.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.040
And then...

17:58.180 --> 17:59.480
..bang!

18:00.460 --> 18:03.449
So you didn't actually see who
started the shooting.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.720
She was upstairs, in her bedroom.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.760
What happened to Stevie?

18:08.980 --> 18:10.690
I told you what happened.

18:12.420 --> 18:14.050
There was an explosion.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.339
- The four-by-four?
- The four-by-four?

18:19.340 --> 18:21.039
The one Mike drove?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.510
- Mike was there?
- Who's Mike?

18:24.340 --> 18:26.550
He's a friend. He works for Andy.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.419
Has he been killed as well?

18:30.420 --> 18:33.749
We believe the man driving
the four-by-four

18:33.750 --> 18:36.789
has been identified as Michael
Adams.

18:36.790 --> 18:39.550
No, no, please.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.299
You need to stop now.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.099
I just had to get to Bluebell.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.790
I just had to get away.

18:47.540 --> 18:51.010
I had to get away from...

18:53.930 --> 18:55.239
So, Christmas Eve,

18:55.240 --> 18:57.719
we know Vernon Rye
and Martin McMorris had a fight

18:57.720 --> 18:59.700
round the back of the King
and Queen pub.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.579
McMorris getting in a cab
at 12.35 am.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.969
He owes Rye
thousands of pounds,

19:06.970 --> 19:09.079
and he tells him he's going to get it from his son
at Orchard House.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.709
Well, I wouldn't trust him,
would you?

19:10.710 --> 19:13.219
- I'd follow him there and make sure.
- Here, watch this.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.380
Here's Rye unlocking his bike,
clearly a bit worse for wear,

19:17.260 --> 19:20.899
then he cycles off
in a different direction.

19:20.900 --> 19:23.599
That doesn't prove he didn't steal
a car or get into a taxi

19:23.600 --> 19:25.319
- and go to Orchard House.
- But crucially,

19:25.320 --> 19:28.579
there's no gunshot residue on
either his skin or on his clothes.

19:28.580 --> 19:29.949
You're sure they weren't washed?

19:29.950 --> 19:31.459
The shirt he was wearing
that night

19:31.460 --> 19:33.649
is still covered in Martin's
blood from the fight.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.839
Given Martin was shot
at point blank range,

19:35.840 --> 19:38.799
that suggests Vernon Rye wasn't the
man who pulled the trigger.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.900
He'd have been covered in GSR.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.019
When did you identify Michael Adams?

19:51.020 --> 19:52.579
That's not his real name.

19:52.580 --> 19:55.779
He was an undercover police officer
working for McMorris.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.659
Does that explain
why the four-by-four

19:57.660 --> 19:59.719
and his body haven't been
sent over to The Lyell?

19:59.720 --> 20:02.819
Nikki, my hands are tied.
Excuse me.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.279
DI Baker -

20:04.280 --> 20:05.989
"The Lyell confirm Vernon Rye

20:05.990 --> 20:09.130
"unlikely to have been
involved in shootings".

20:09.980 --> 20:13.490
Which brings us back to Andy -
did you find anything this morning?

20:14.220 --> 20:16.739
Footwear marks across the lawn
leading towards to the lake,

20:16.740 --> 20:20.379
and a tyre mark which I think
probably belongs to a wheelbarrow.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.359
What would Andy be doing
with a wheelbarrow?

20:22.360 --> 20:23.869
I don't know.
Thanks.

20:23.870 --> 20:26.579
Right, so we know that Andy was with
someone else Christmas Eve.

20:26.580 --> 20:28.689
Is there any evidence that
that person's been murdered?

20:28.690 --> 20:30.899
Not that we've found so far,
but that doesn't mean

20:30.900 --> 20:32.659
that they weren't murdered
somewhere else and then taken.

20:32.660 --> 20:34.279
So he could have murdered them,
dumped them,

20:34.280 --> 20:36.630
but why didn't
he dump all the other bodies?

20:37.460 --> 20:41.269
The neighbours heard "fireworks"
shortly after 1.00,

20:41.270 --> 20:43.829
and then the police officers
arrived just after half past.

20:43.830 --> 20:46.459
He only had a 30-minute window.

20:46.460 --> 20:47.760
All right.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.150
What if it wasn't a body?

20:50.860 --> 20:53.069
It's my belief
that Michael Adams,

20:53.070 --> 20:54.379
working undercover,

20:54.380 --> 20:57.369
was investigating
Andy's haulage firm.

20:57.370 --> 20:59.029
We know that Andy
took a lorry out

20:59.030 --> 21:00.589
on the 18th of December,
possibly

21:00.590 --> 21:03.950
to pick up a consignment
of Russian automatic weapons.

21:04.260 --> 21:07.609
Now, there's no sign of weapons
at the haulage depot...

21:07.610 --> 21:09.169
So you think he took them
to the house?

21:09.170 --> 21:11.219
We've searched everywhere else.

21:11.220 --> 21:13.529
Apart from the ones we
found in Andy's office,

21:13.530 --> 21:15.820
there's no sign of
the other weapons.

21:16.260 --> 21:18.299
The only place we haven't searched
is...

21:18.300 --> 21:20.480
- The lake.
- The lake, yeah.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.290
The lake.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.360
Is that it?

21:25.940 --> 21:29.220
How exactly am I meant to get
back to me caravan?

21:33.900 --> 21:35.260
Do you want a lift?

21:42.780 --> 21:44.080
Yeah.

21:52.460 --> 21:54.280
My brother's inside.

21:56.860 --> 21:58.499
What did he do?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.259
Does it matter?

22:00.260 --> 22:01.560
No.

22:02.940 --> 22:04.240
We all never did it.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.649
Was it you who proved me innocent?

22:09.650 --> 22:10.980
Science did that.

22:15.740 --> 22:17.509
My family stopped
coming to see me

22:17.510 --> 22:19.400
a few years into me sentence.

22:21.060 --> 22:24.190
I thought, "I'll be all right,
who cares?"

22:25.620 --> 22:27.320
But I DID care.

22:29.340 --> 22:33.070
In the end, they're the only ones
who really know you...

22:34.260 --> 22:36.270
..who'll give you a second chance.

22:50.340 --> 22:52.450
- What's your name?
- Jack.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.770
- Happy Christmas, Jack.
- And a better New Year.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.139
What are you doing out of bed?

23:31.140 --> 23:33.100
Mel?
It's all right.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.500
It's all right.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.540
It's OK.

23:42.340 --> 23:44.060
Oh, love.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.199
- Hi.
- Want some tea?

23:51.200 --> 23:53.339
No, thanks.
So, Michael Adams

23:53.340 --> 23:55.990
is the name of the man
in the four-by-four.

23:56.540 --> 23:58.339
Our undercover cop.

23:58.340 --> 24:01.179
I'm thinking that he could be
the M in Stevie's diary.

24:01.180 --> 24:03.659
"Must tell Mel the truth about M."

24:03.660 --> 24:05.269
What do you think it means?

24:05.270 --> 24:07.939
An undercover cop bought a
19-year-old an iPhone for Christmas?

24:07.940 --> 24:10.779
A reconditioned one.
It wasn't new.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.630
- Thanks.
- You never make tea.

24:12.940 --> 24:14.379
Happy Christmas.

24:14.380 --> 24:18.199
Do you think that Martin didn't know
that his son had bankrupted

24:18.200 --> 24:19.509
and that everything was lost?

24:19.510 --> 24:22.280
I don't know. Not an easy thing
to own up to. Thank you.

24:23.460 --> 24:26.619
So, Martin McMorris owes
Vernon Rye money.

24:26.620 --> 24:28.859
Goes to see his son,
asks him to help out.

24:28.860 --> 24:32.149
But son can't help Dad out
because... he doesn't have any.

24:32.150 --> 24:33.859
You examine the shoes you
found in the master bedroom?

24:33.860 --> 24:35.499
- Just about to.
- Thank you.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.609
Andy's upstairs sipping
the last of the champagne,

24:38.610 --> 24:40.179
snorting the last of the cocaine,

24:40.180 --> 24:42.849
in walks the old man demanding
money he doesn't have.

24:42.850 --> 24:45.699
Add an automatic
weapon to that lethal cocktail...

24:45.700 --> 24:48.719
What we know is whoever killed Martin
would have been covered in gunshot residue,

24:48.720 --> 24:51.689
and the only person we haven't been
able to test who we know was there...

24:51.690 --> 24:54.319
- is Andy McMorris.
- I claim my prize.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.779
What?

24:55.780 --> 24:57.389
I knew I'd seen it
somewhere before.

24:57.390 --> 24:59.699
- What?
- The necklace.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.219
Who's that?

25:01.220 --> 25:03.540
That's Zoe's sister,
Jackie Emmans.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.020
She was with Andy on Christmas Eve?

25:08.180 --> 25:09.800
You're going to be fine, sweetheart.

25:11.380 --> 25:12.680
Yeah.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.550
Thanks for coming, Auntie Jackie.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.400
<i>She's going to be all right,
isn't she?</i>

25:32.300 --> 25:34.550
<i>- Mrs. Emmans?
- Yes.</i>

25:36.060 --> 25:39.600
Just a quick question regarding
the events at Orchard House.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.300
Is that your necklace, Mrs. Emmans?

25:47.420 --> 25:49.360
I'm so sorry.

25:53.050 --> 25:54.959
I was with Andy Christmas Eve.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.260
<i>I was going to tell you...</i>

25:57.300 --> 25:58.609
<i>You bitch!</i>

25:58.610 --> 26:00.220
<i>- Get her out of here!
- Yep, yeah.</i>

26:01.500 --> 26:02.860
<i>Get off me!</i>

26:06.220 --> 26:09.009
Calm down,
OK?

26:09.010 --> 26:10.869
Two days ago,
I had a family.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.170
Now look at me.

26:15.660 --> 26:17.429
So how long had you and Andy

26:17.430 --> 26:19.050
been having sex for?

26:22.340 --> 26:23.940
Couple of months.

26:26.660 --> 26:30.190
After Zoe left him, I went round to
collect some stuff, and...

26:31.940 --> 26:34.979
We've always had this flirty thing
going on, and...

26:34.980 --> 26:37.089
Well, it just happened.

26:37.090 --> 26:39.390
What time did you get
there on Christmas Eve?

26:40.220 --> 26:43.850
He sent a message about 10.30
on WhatsApp.

26:44.620 --> 26:47.120
Stevie and Mel were going to church,
and so...

26:47.580 --> 26:51.419
"I've left the gate open -
get over here quick."

26:51.420 --> 26:54.560
And what did you tell your husband?
It was Christmas Eve.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.720
I had tonnes of wrapping to do...

27:03.220 --> 27:04.940
and...

27:08.580 --> 27:11.340
..he should go upstairs to bed.
He's not been well.

27:12.540 --> 27:14.550
What time did you get to
Orchard House?

27:14.980 --> 27:16.880
About 11.45.

27:17.660 --> 27:20.039
I saw the au pair
leaving with the girls.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.820
And what did you and Andy do?

27:27.780 --> 27:30.029
We had a drink. Had sex.

27:30.030 --> 27:31.769
Any drugs involved?

27:31.770 --> 27:33.389
Coke is Andy's thing, not mine.

27:33.390 --> 27:34.879
How long were you there?

27:34.880 --> 27:36.499
About an hour, not long.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.499
His dad walked in on us.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.179
What time was that?

27:40.180 --> 27:42.059
Around 1.00.

27:42.060 --> 27:44.659
And what was Martin's reaction
when he saw his son

27:44.660 --> 27:46.099
screwing his sister-in-law?

27:46.100 --> 27:48.110
I thought Andy was
going to kill him.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.900
He was swearing...

27:52.740 --> 27:55.250
..shouting. I was scared.
I was really scared.

27:56.110 --> 27:57.419
And then what happened?

27:57.420 --> 27:59.829
I got out of there as quickly
as I could. What do you think?

27:59.830 --> 28:02.559
You left your necklace.
It's broken.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.739
Did someone rip it off your neck?

28:04.740 --> 28:07.680
Andy was crazy. I've never seen him
like that before.

28:09.860 --> 28:11.580
And what were you wearing?

28:15.340 --> 28:19.339
- What were you wearing?
- A red dress and stockings.

28:19.340 --> 28:20.829
I am now showing Mrs. Emmans

28:20.830 --> 28:23.039
two items of underwear -
a bra and knickers.

28:23.040 --> 28:27.019
We retrieved those from your
linen basket in the bathroom.

28:27.020 --> 28:30.059
Would you care to explain how
gunshot residue was found on them?

28:30.060 --> 28:33.259
I never touched a gun. I swear!

28:33.260 --> 28:34.819
And what about Andy?
Did you ever see him touch a gun?

28:34.820 --> 28:37.509
No.
I promise you on my kids' lives.

28:37.510 --> 28:38.859
OK.

28:38.860 --> 28:41.550
OK. Where was Andy going
on the 18th?

28:42.140 --> 28:43.449
How would I know?

28:43.450 --> 28:45.340
He took a truck from the depot.

28:45.670 --> 28:48.429
- I was at a school nativity on the 18th.
- You knew where he was.

28:48.430 --> 28:50.019
No,
I didn't know where he was.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.210
- Where is he now?
- In hell, as far as I'm concerned.

28:56.660 --> 29:00.480
Cooke believes Andy McMorris was
using the lake to store guns.

29:02.020 --> 29:03.620
We're going to be here all night.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.199
<i>What do you mean,</i>
there's not enough evidence?

29:10.200 --> 29:12.579
Jackie Emmans is lying
through her teeth.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.909
What about the gunshot residue
on her underwear?

29:14.910 --> 29:16.919
McMorris must have had
residue on his hands,

29:16.920 --> 29:18.889
and it transferred onto Jackie's
clothing when he undressed her.

29:18.890 --> 29:22.149
So you're telling us that Jackie didn't fire
the gun that killed the rest of the family?

29:22.150 --> 29:24.829
No, I'm saying there's insufficient
evidence from her clothing.

29:24.830 --> 29:27.499
Right, where does this leave us?
Exactly where we started.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.579
- We need to find Andy.
- Have a look at this.

29:30.580 --> 29:33.800
This is the 18th of December.

29:35.060 --> 29:38.239
Andy leaves the house, gets in his
car, drives off through the gates.

29:38.240 --> 29:42.609
And this - this is Zoe
arriving on the 21st.

29:42.610 --> 29:44.719
She's come to pick up her kids to
go and see her mum.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.729
Now, we don't see Andy again

29:46.730 --> 29:48.799
till the 23rd of December.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.519
The day that we know
he drove back through Dover.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.739
We've got images of him
on the M25, M20

29:53.740 --> 29:56.459
and then he goes off
at the junction.

29:56.460 --> 29:58.459
We know that Andy came back
to the house.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.279
Look,
we need to find this lorry.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.039
Right, well, have a look at this.
This is Andy returning to the house,

30:03.040 --> 30:05.010
the 23rd of December.

30:06.740 --> 30:08.560
Right, what's he got there, then?

30:10.860 --> 30:13.349
- Mistletoe. So what?
- It's not just the mistletoe.

30:13.350 --> 30:16.019
We found mud on his car.
We tested it.

30:16.020 --> 30:18.049
It's a match for the mud
we found on the boot

30:18.050 --> 30:19.869
upstairs in the bedroom
at Orchard House.

30:19.870 --> 30:21.600
Traces of calcium.

30:22.060 --> 30:23.529
- Chalk.
- So,

30:23.530 --> 30:27.129
Andy leaves the house on the 18th
and he comes back on the 23rd.

30:27.130 --> 30:28.439
We think...

30:28.440 --> 30:31.319
wherever he left his car during that
period is where he left the lorry.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.620
- Right.
- This...

30:33.130 --> 30:34.580
is McMorris Haulage.

30:35.020 --> 30:38.070
And this - this is a chalk pit.

30:39.430 --> 30:41.180
It's a two-mile walk.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.000
Bingo.

30:43.780 --> 30:45.080
Call it in.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.540
Clear!

31:57.460 --> 31:58.780
They've got something!

32:12.180 --> 32:13.480
You're kidding me.

32:20.780 --> 32:22.700
We've found guns.

32:25.780 --> 32:27.960
<i>We've found Andy McMorris.</i>

32:29.520 --> 32:31.499
Brought across the lawn
in a wheelbarrow

32:31.500 --> 32:33.899
that was also found in the lake.

32:33.900 --> 32:37.459
I thought Mel told you it was
her father who did this.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.379
Yes, but she was in shock, so...

32:39.380 --> 32:41.139
Maybe she's covering for someone.

32:41.140 --> 32:44.550
Who? Who?
If it wasn't Andy, who is it?

32:45.060 --> 32:47.069
Clarissa mentioned
that Andy was on trial

32:47.070 --> 32:49.059
for attempted murder,
and the trial collapsed.

32:49.060 --> 32:50.589
Could it have been
someone connected to that?

32:50.590 --> 32:52.649
We're looking into that,
but it's highly unlikely.

32:52.650 --> 32:54.559
Isn't it time we looked at the
four-by-four,

32:54.560 --> 32:55.969
and at the body of Michael Adams?

32:55.970 --> 32:58.909
An undercover police officer
investigating the importation

32:58.910 --> 33:00.779
of some serious weaponry.

33:00.780 --> 33:03.339
Andy was clearly mixing with some
very dangerous people.

33:03.340 --> 33:06.679
And what, Jack?
What do you think it was? A hit?

33:06.680 --> 33:09.230
What, he's crossed
the Russian mafia, has he?

33:09.620 --> 33:11.600
Maybe that's what Mel meant -

33:12.350 --> 33:15.459
that her father was to blame,
for bringing this on the family.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.939
I think it's time we get the
four-by-four back to The Lyell

33:17.940 --> 33:20.140
so we can start doing our jobs.

33:36.770 --> 33:38.079
When it was found,

33:38.080 --> 33:40.389
the body was in the so-called
pugilistic posture,

33:40.390 --> 33:43.080
curled up,
fists gripped tight.

33:50.700 --> 33:54.930
So we've got full thickness
burns across most of the body,

33:55.950 --> 33:58.330
particularly the right
side of the head,

33:59.340 --> 34:01.649
the right shoulder,
upper chest,

34:01.650 --> 34:02.950
right hip.

34:08.139 --> 34:10.978
As the skin has burned,
we've got breaches.

34:10.980 --> 34:13.458
Significant ones
on both calves,

34:13.460 --> 34:15.469
right and left thighs,
right hip,

34:15.469 --> 34:16.949
right elbow...

34:17.300 --> 34:19.199
Yes, and left elbow.

34:31.699 --> 34:33.679
He was hit by a bullet.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.779
We have an entry wound,
left side of the neck,

34:37.780 --> 34:41.129
ten centimetres below the
external auditory meatus.

34:41.130 --> 34:43.739
The fire has destroyed any reliable
evidence of soot stains

34:43.739 --> 34:45.350
or burns around it.

34:52.020 --> 34:53.339
Did the bullet kill him?

34:53.340 --> 34:56.379
Hard to say, but from its
appearance, and location,

34:56.380 --> 34:59.790
I'd say it was
probably not in itself fatal.

35:00.500 --> 35:03.420
So was he alive when the
four-by-four caught fire?

35:19.420 --> 35:22.610
Soot in the trachea,
down towards both lungs.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.749
Indicates Mr. Adams
was still alive

35:25.750 --> 35:28.149
- when the fire started.
- Jesus.

35:28.150 --> 35:31.589
<i>As the fire caught hold, burning
the various man-made materials in the car,</i>

35:31.590 --> 35:34.459
<i>in the car, they'll have given off
significant amounts of cyanide</i>

35:34.460 --> 35:37.500
<i>and carbon monoxide,
which he would have inhaled.</i>

35:38.700 --> 35:40.000
Hold on...

35:46.580 --> 35:48.540
That is a sim card.

35:51.420 --> 35:54.029
What, you think Adams know
he was going to die

35:54.030 --> 35:55.830
and, what,
decided to swallow it?

36:01.380 --> 36:03.060
Maybe.

36:03.950 --> 36:06.840
OK.
I need to see what's on that.

36:09.940 --> 36:11.240
Merry Christmas.

36:14.460 --> 36:17.829
A tracking device.
Just what I've always wanted!

36:17.830 --> 36:20.599
A tracking device that not only
tracks where a vehicle is,

36:20.600 --> 36:23.049
but if it's incapacitated
in some way,

36:23.050 --> 36:26.579
it automatically sends a signal...
A signal to the minder,

36:26.580 --> 36:30.260
who called it in from a phone box
outside Reading Station.

36:30.940 --> 36:32.630
What happens now?

36:42.540 --> 36:44.300
Mum?

36:52.780 --> 36:54.080
It's Laurence.

36:58.380 --> 36:59.680
Hi.

37:05.180 --> 37:08.300
OK. I understand.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

37:13.540 --> 37:15.900
They want me
to identify your dad.

37:37.940 --> 37:39.659
Andy's phone,
Stevie's phone,

37:39.660 --> 37:42.780
Mel's phone and the sim card
we found in Michael Adams.

37:43.180 --> 37:46.139
Andy called and sent messages
to Michael Adams,

37:46.140 --> 37:47.699
he clearly trusted him.

37:47.700 --> 37:51.179
Stevie, the older sister,
also sent messages.

37:51.180 --> 37:54.019
In the last month,
they got more and more suggestive,

37:54.020 --> 37:56.859
invitations out,
promises of intimacy.

37:56.860 --> 38:00.119
She also sent him some
quite intimate photos,

38:00.120 --> 38:03.149
but Adams seems to have
kept his distance.

38:03.150 --> 38:05.979
That's good to hear. Did you find
anything on the sim card?

38:05.980 --> 38:08.569
Not very much.
Most of the calls he made

38:08.570 --> 38:10.189
and messages had been deleted.

38:10.190 --> 38:11.799
Yeah, well, the last
thing he would have wanted

38:11.800 --> 38:14.859
was to be found out
as an undercover police officer.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.539
Was it Andy who called
Adams on Christmas Eve?

38:17.540 --> 38:19.659
No,
it was Mel who called him.

38:19.660 --> 38:21.300
We know she trusted him.

38:21.620 --> 38:23.600
A desperate call for help.

38:27.220 --> 38:29.010
I don't think I can do this.

38:29.980 --> 38:33.170
You can take as much
time as you like.

38:34.540 --> 38:36.809
No. Please.

38:36.810 --> 38:39.510
I'm afraid we do need the body
formally identified.

38:40.940 --> 38:42.300
This way.

38:52.340 --> 38:55.639
So if Adams deleted most of his
messages and calls,

38:55.640 --> 38:57.499
why did he swallow the sim card?

38:57.500 --> 39:00.660
Because he was saving
something for us to find.

39:01.660 --> 39:03.159
Stored on this card

39:03.160 --> 39:05.520
was a landline number
for a place in Reading.

39:05.860 --> 39:07.939
- A minder.
- Exactly.

39:07.940 --> 39:10.899
There was also a message he received
earlier in the day

39:10.900 --> 39:12.599
which he didn't delete -

39:12.600 --> 39:14.929
"What if it's not all
over by Christmas?"

39:14.930 --> 39:16.599
- Who sent that?
- We don't know.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.250
Right, let's call it.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.950
You sent Michael Adams a text.

40:04.620 --> 40:07.260
He said it would be all over
by Christmas.

40:08.660 --> 40:10.600
I made sure of it.

40:13.940 --> 40:15.859
I never should have married him.

40:15.860 --> 40:17.589
Everyone said I was mad,

40:17.590 --> 40:20.810
but I was in love,
and determined to make it work.

40:21.740 --> 40:24.990
With my father's money,
we built the most amazing house,

40:25.540 --> 40:27.750
but it was never enough.

40:29.020 --> 40:32.300
I was never enough for any of them.

40:33.460 --> 40:36.359
All Mel could think about was her
precious bloody horse,

40:36.360 --> 40:37.990
and as for Stevie...

40:39.100 --> 40:42.939
..thrown out of school for
dealing drugs, and blaming me. Me!

40:42.940 --> 40:46.819
It wasn't me who screwed everything
up, everything we had.

40:46.820 --> 40:49.539
And you know what Andy's
big plan was?

40:49.540 --> 40:52.950
Guns!
Smuggling guns!

40:53.780 --> 40:55.779
And then he applied
for sole custody.

40:55.780 --> 40:58.859
We'd agreed we wouldn't fight
for the kids,

40:58.860 --> 41:00.880
that they would be wherever
they wanted to be,

41:01.460 --> 41:04.540
and I went round there with a
letter from my solicitor.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.500
I would have killed him then,
but he wasn't there.

41:10.620 --> 41:13.199
I told Mike I was
going to the police,

41:13.200 --> 41:16.009
I was going to destroy Andy, and
he told me the police

41:16.010 --> 41:20.259
were already onto him, and that it would
all be over by Christmas,

41:20.260 --> 41:21.760
but then it hit me...

41:23.060 --> 41:24.419
..if Andy goes down,

41:24.420 --> 41:27.009
he'll make sure
I go down with him,

41:27.010 --> 41:29.850
and I wasn't going to
let that happen. No way.

41:31.020 --> 41:32.320
No way.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.619
<i>It's Christmas Eve.
So at</i> 11.45,

41:38.620 --> 41:40.309
the au pair, Gabrielle,

41:40.310 --> 41:43.010
took Stevie
and Mel to midnight mass.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.379
- Bye, Dad.
- Take care, yeah?

41:58.380 --> 41:59.940
Look after my girls, yeah?

42:04.530 --> 42:07.239
The girls drove to the church
and passed Jackie Emmans,

42:07.240 --> 42:09.149
who, after getting
a message from Andy,

42:09.150 --> 42:11.000
was waiting for them to leave.

42:13.460 --> 42:16.699
Andy left the gates open,
switched off the CCTV,

42:16.700 --> 42:18.660
and awaited Jackie's arrival.

42:21.340 --> 42:23.039
How are you doing?
You all right?

42:23.040 --> 42:24.340
Yeah, I'm good.

42:27.660 --> 42:29.399
Jackie only had
a couple of hours

42:29.400 --> 42:31.059
before her husband
would miss her,

42:31.060 --> 42:34.590
so they had a quick drink
and headed upstairs.

42:40.020 --> 42:42.920
Later, in the master bedroom...

42:44.060 --> 42:47.030
..we know that Andy and Jackie
drank champagne,

42:47.540 --> 42:49.850
and that Andy snorted some cocaine.

42:52.220 --> 42:55.060
We also know that McMorris
loved his guns...

42:55.980 --> 42:59.390
..which might explain how Jackie
got gunshot residue...

43:00.540 --> 43:02.150
..on her underwear.

43:03.380 --> 43:04.680
Andy!

43:05.820 --> 43:07.240
Stay there.

43:07.580 --> 43:11.040
And later, his father, Martin,
arrives...

43:12.260 --> 43:15.440
..we think around 12.50.

43:22.060 --> 43:26.980
The old man walks in, catches them
having sex, and an argument ensues.

43:34.260 --> 43:36.890
Jackie says she left
the house at around 1.00.

43:38.100 --> 43:41.979
And Zoe, according to her
confession, also arrives at 1.00.

43:41.980 --> 43:44.359
But Jackie never
mentioned seeing Zoe

43:44.360 --> 43:46.319
either in the house
or on her way out.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.669
But I thought Zoe said
one of her motives

43:48.670 --> 43:51.659
for what happened was her seeing
Jackie and Andy in bed together.

43:51.660 --> 43:54.169
Yeah, but I don't think
she meant that literally.

43:54.170 --> 43:56.560
She said she saw Jackie
leaving the house.

43:57.100 --> 43:59.069
The only thing we know
for certain

43:59.070 --> 44:01.729
is that Jackie drove
past the police

44:01.730 --> 44:05.939
who were called to the house,
six miles away, at 1.20.

44:05.940 --> 44:08.419
Who's going to pay for this
bloody lot, then, eh?

44:08.420 --> 44:10.529
What are you doing, you fool?
Eh?

44:10.530 --> 44:12.999
I bet Zoe don't know
what you're up to.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.829
And you're going to go and tell her,
are you?

44:14.830 --> 44:16.739
For a price, I might not.

44:16.740 --> 44:18.059
Zoe also said

44:18.060 --> 44:21.360
she came home and saw
Andy and his father arguing.

44:22.460 --> 44:24.480
Happy bloody Christmas.

44:24.790 --> 44:26.920
You've got what's coming, love.

44:27.470 --> 44:29.479
She said that Martin was
laughing at her,

44:29.480 --> 44:32.969
and told her that Andy and Jackie
had been having sex upstairs.

44:32.970 --> 44:34.829
At least he kept it
in the family, eh?

44:34.830 --> 44:36.139
- Oi!
- Get out...

44:36.140 --> 44:37.979
Zoe went in to the study.

44:37.980 --> 44:40.610
She opened the drawer,
and picked up the machine gun.

44:42.860 --> 44:46.379
And, as soon as she saw Andy's dad,

44:46.380 --> 44:48.380
she started shooting.

44:57.780 --> 45:00.119
She said Andy ran through
the kitchen.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.859
She followed him,
firing the gun as she went,

45:02.860 --> 45:05.809
accidentally shooting Stevie,

45:05.810 --> 45:08.160
who was making herself
a hot chocolate.

45:23.180 --> 45:25.739
She ran out, she opened fire.

45:25.740 --> 45:27.519
She killed Andy,

45:27.520 --> 45:29.549
but she also shot the horse

45:29.550 --> 45:31.739
and seriously wounded Mel.

45:31.740 --> 45:35.100
Who had climbed out of her window
and made it across the paddock.

45:37.740 --> 45:41.110
Zoe then made her way
back through the house.

45:42.660 --> 45:46.760
She heard Gabrielle, the au pair,
coming up the stairs

45:47.300 --> 45:49.300
to see what had happened.

45:54.180 --> 45:57.650
She told her to take a car
and leave the house.

45:58.300 --> 46:01.139
It's at this point she saw
the four-by-four arriving.

46:01.140 --> 46:03.139
Why did she kill Michael Adams?

46:03.140 --> 46:04.979
She said she didn't know who it was,

46:04.980 --> 46:08.219
and that she was so out of her mind,
that she just opened fire.

46:08.220 --> 46:11.250
Can I just say that none of this
really makes much sense?

46:11.860 --> 46:14.809
What did the text mean? "What if
it's not all over by Christmas?"

46:14.810 --> 46:18.139
From what I understand,
the consignment of illegal guns

46:18.140 --> 46:19.819
was to be sold on Boxing Day.

46:19.820 --> 46:23.650
The undercover operation would see
Andy and his buyers arrested.

46:24.260 --> 46:27.399
Michael knew this was going to
happen, but he wanted to reassure Zoe.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.019
- Reassure Zoe? About what?
- All right,

46:29.020 --> 46:31.699
OK,
I know there's discrepancies.

46:31.700 --> 46:33.989
I'm sure,
in the weeks to come,

46:33.990 --> 46:37.130
Zoe will clarify exactly
what's happened here.

46:37.740 --> 46:40.490
In the meantime, thank you all
for your hard work.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.080
What?
You think Zoe made it all up?

46:49.420 --> 46:52.089
I think a lot of what she said in
her statement

46:52.090 --> 46:55.019
doesn't coincide withthe facts
as we know them.

46:55.020 --> 46:58.100
He said that Mel was possibly
covering for someone.

46:58.610 --> 47:00.619
Mm. Did she say anything about
her mother to you?

47:00.620 --> 47:02.059
I'm seeing her later.

47:02.060 --> 47:04.169
I promised to get
her some more things.

47:04.170 --> 47:08.339
I heard on the news that they'd
found the father's body in the lake.

47:08.340 --> 47:09.680
Is that right?

47:11.020 --> 47:12.620
We'll see you back at The Lyell.

47:16.060 --> 47:18.180
Mel must be devastated.

47:19.660 --> 47:21.759
I'm sure,
when she's feeling a bit better,

47:21.760 --> 47:23.229
you could visit her.

47:23.230 --> 47:26.280
I was wondering what to do
with Mel's present.

47:26.780 --> 47:30.359
She'd brought her father some
freshwater fish for the lake.

47:30.360 --> 47:31.959
When did she buy them?

47:31.960 --> 47:33.819
Well, they were delivered
a few days ago,

47:33.820 --> 47:37.380
and then she came round on Christmas
Eve to make sure they were all OK.

47:38.300 --> 47:41.899
She was really looking forward
to giving them to him.

47:41.900 --> 47:45.410
She so wanted this Christmas to
be just perfect.

48:05.020 --> 48:08.139
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Did you do the tests on Mel's clothes?

48:08.140 --> 48:09.449
Have you got the results?

48:09.450 --> 48:12.459
I'm wondering if there's been
some kind of Christmas mix-up.

48:12.460 --> 48:13.769
What do you mean?

48:13.770 --> 48:15.909
Well, we know Melanie was shot

48:15.910 --> 48:17.839
and so her blood
would be on the dress,

48:17.840 --> 48:19.969
and we know she tried
<i>to help Bluebell.</i>

48:19.970 --> 48:21.279
Who lost a lot of blood.

48:21.280 --> 48:25.119
But there are also
traces of Martin's blood,

48:25.120 --> 48:28.939
of her father's,
<i>and her sister Stevie's.</i>

48:28.940 --> 48:31.298
- I'll call Nikki.
- And I'll call Cooke and update him.

48:31.790 --> 48:33.590
Shit.
Turn round.

49:09.100 --> 49:11.480
"Must tell Mel
the truth about M."

49:40.150 --> 49:42.249
"Good Luck Mel!
I know you can do it."

49:42.250 --> 49:43.550
"Love M"

49:52.660 --> 49:54.499
"Rimonabant.

49:54.500 --> 49:57.109
"Side effects may include
severe depression,

49:57.110 --> 49:58.790
"anxiety,
mood changes."

50:02.960 --> 50:04.280
Mel?

50:06.820 --> 50:08.120
Mel!

50:15.160 --> 50:18.239
<i>Right, listen, Mel's gone missing.
Is Nikki still at the house?</i>

50:18.240 --> 50:19.809
- Yep.
- I've tried her.

50:19.810 --> 50:22.560
- Phone's dead.
<i>- Right, I'm calling for backup.</i>

50:26.220 --> 50:27.520
Mel!

50:30.260 --> 50:32.500
- Mel!
- Leave me alone!

50:39.100 --> 50:41.320
I knew you'd find out.

50:42.220 --> 50:43.659
Oh, Mel.

50:43.660 --> 50:46.550
Dad always told me that everything
was going to be OK.

50:49.740 --> 50:51.550
Look at it!

50:53.460 --> 50:55.959
How can you lose all this?

50:55.960 --> 50:58.019
But that wasn't
why you took the gun

50:58.020 --> 50:59.799
from your dad's office,
was it?

50:59.800 --> 51:01.750
You were jealous of your sister.

51:05.420 --> 51:07.850
- Mel...
- Leave me alone!

51:14.540 --> 51:15.840
Mel!

51:19.050 --> 51:20.350
Mel!

51:28.300 --> 51:30.260
Why did you call Michael Adams?

51:31.180 --> 51:34.210
He was the only one that
cared about you and Bluebell.

51:38.260 --> 51:40.680
Stevie knew how much Mike meant
to me.

51:43.620 --> 51:45.990
He didn't know how I felt,

51:46.860 --> 51:49.450
but...
she did,

51:49.860 --> 51:51.850
and she had to have him.

51:54.140 --> 51:56.770
When I phoned Mike,
he tried to explain...

51:59.220 --> 52:02.260
..but Grandad was laughing
at me, and Dad...

52:15.460 --> 52:18.380
I bought Dad these stupid fish...

52:19.180 --> 52:21.650
..for his stupid lake.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.280
All that money wasted.

52:28.300 --> 52:30.980
I was going to put everyone
in there, but then...

52:31.900 --> 52:34.160
..the police arrived, and...

52:35.300 --> 52:37.290
You needed to cover your tracks.

52:40.260 --> 52:42.640
It was like I'd suddenly woken up.

52:44.260 --> 52:46.720
Is that when you
tried to shoot yourself?

52:50.380 --> 52:52.290
I went into the woods...

52:54.900 --> 52:57.240
..where they'd never find me.

53:00.140 --> 53:02.320
I wrapped the gun in the blanket...

53:04.420 --> 53:06.710
..and pointed it at my heart.

53:07.300 --> 53:08.940
Dr. Alexander?

53:10.140 --> 53:12.459
Sergeant Chainey!
I'm with Mel!

53:12.460 --> 53:15.179
I know.
DCI Cooke called it in.

53:15.180 --> 53:17.220
She's very scared.

53:18.660 --> 53:20.300
If I go out there now,

53:20.620 --> 53:22.300
they'll shoot me.

53:24.740 --> 53:27.200
And it'll all be over.

53:28.420 --> 53:30.580
I told you I once had a horse.

53:35.100 --> 53:37.770
How did it make you feel,
riding Bluebell?

53:40.300 --> 53:43.110
It was the only time
I ever felt completely free.

53:44.260 --> 53:47.180
But my horse died,
and I stopped.

53:50.100 --> 53:51.470
But you know what?

53:52.580 --> 53:54.620
I want to ride again.

53:57.060 --> 53:58.820
To feel that again.

54:01.980 --> 54:03.940
Isn't that what you want, Mel?

54:05.340 --> 54:07.330
To feel like that again?

54:11.340 --> 54:13.600
To feel that alive?

55:11.420 --> 55:15.420
- I've got one more present.
- Look at that one!

55:22.940 --> 55:24.839
Thank you for my Christmas
presents.

55:24.840 --> 55:26.590
I'm glad you like them.

55:29.380 --> 55:30.780
How are you doing?

55:32.740 --> 55:35.960
Maybe this is how we should do
Christmas Day next year.

55:36.740 --> 55:38.810
Your folks on Boxing Day,

55:39.420 --> 55:41.659
a new tradition.

55:41.660 --> 55:43.780
Just me and you?

55:45.480 --> 55:46.800
I'd like that.

55:57.700 --> 56:00.390
Thank you for coming with me now.

56:01.420 --> 56:03.219
Still think it's a waste of time.

56:03.220 --> 56:05.030
He's not going to want to see me,
Dad.

56:05.860 --> 56:07.670
You don't know that.

56:12.140 --> 56:14.110
He's your brother.

56:28.140 --> 56:29.780
That's sweet.

56:35.660 --> 56:37.760
They're beautiful!

56:38.340 --> 56:40.459
Awesome, cheers!
Thanks very much.

56:40.460 --> 56:42.380
Who's that?
Is that you?

56:45.220 --> 56:48.129
<i>You didn't have any other presents?
Not even a card or anything?</i>

56:48.130 --> 56:50.250
Only from Secret Santa at The Lyell.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.300
<i>Don't you think you should
open that?</i>

56:54.620 --> 56:55.920
OK.

56:57.420 --> 57:00.100
<i>That's a Santa secret
that needs to be opened.</i>

57:00.460 --> 57:04.750
- Look at my tree!
- It's very festive.

57:17.940 --> 57:20.579
An open ticket to Washington!

57:20.580 --> 57:22.320
<i>What time is it there?</i>

57:22.820 --> 57:25.269
Just after 4.30.

57:25.270 --> 57:28.499
<i>OK, well, you'd better hurry up,
because the last flight's at 9.00pm.</i>

57:28.500 --> 57:30.869
- What?
<i>- It's all booked.</i>

57:30.870 --> 57:32.779
<i>I spoke to Clarissa,
everything is fine.</i>

57:32.780 --> 57:34.089
I can't!

57:34.090 --> 57:36.719
<i>No, she spoke to Jack,
and then spoke to Thomas...</i>

57:36.720 --> 57:38.179
You're serious?

57:38.180 --> 57:40.059
<i>"Happy to get rid of you",</i>

57:40.060 --> 57:41.700
<i>I think is what they said.</i>

57:43.340 --> 57:45.500
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

57:47.820 --> 57:50.650
- I think I'd better get packing!
<i>- Yes, hurry!</i>

57:51.460 --> 57:55.100
Oh, wait.
Hang on, don't go anywhere.

58:00.780 --> 58:02.450
Hi.

58:07.270 --> 58:09.290
Merry Christmas!
