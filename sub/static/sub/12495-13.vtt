<i>Aah!</i>

00:53.762 --> 00:56.097
That show is intense.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.726
My heart's all cramped up.

00:59.810 --> 01:00.769
I'm sweating...

01:01.269 --> 01:02.354
More than usual.

01:03.772 --> 01:04.648
Use your rag.

01:04.690 --> 01:05.524
Oh yeah, my rag.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.529
Seriously, you guys, that was,

01:07.568 --> 01:10.529
like, the best episode ever.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.613
True that.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.613
Totally.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.782
But I'm so sad.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.743
Why?

01:15.784 --> 01:17.411
Only one more episode

01:15.784 --> 01:17.411
left of "Walking Orange."

01:17.912 --> 01:19.246
And...

01:17.912 --> 01:19.246
(sniffs)

01:19.914 --> 01:21.164
I don't want it to end.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.835

01:25.126 --> 01:25.878
No...

01:26.921 --> 01:27.963
My eyes are just sweating.

01:29.130 --> 01:29.965
Rag.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.008
Oh yeah, my rag.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.304
Hey, I read online that next

01:33.343 --> 01:36.304
week's episode is going to--

01:36.346 --> 01:37.639
No, no, no!

01:39.516 --> 01:42.352
Please, don't tell us anything

01:39.516 --> 01:42.352
about the series finale.

01:42.394 --> 01:43.437
Don't spoil it.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.819
I was just going to say

01:48.483 --> 01:50.819
that after the finale,

01:50.861 --> 01:52.404
they're going to rerun

01:50.861 --> 01:52.404
the first episode.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.657
Ohhh...

01:57.076 --> 01:59.078
So you can put

01:57.076 --> 01:59.078
the pillows down.

02:00.245 --> 02:00.955
Hey!

02:01.413 --> 02:02.998
I need one of you

02:01.413 --> 02:02.998
to be my cameraman.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.422
What kind of video

02:08.879 --> 02:10.422
are you making?

02:10.714 --> 02:13.092
The kind that gets me

02:10.714 --> 02:13.092
into the Man Fans.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.177
The Man Fans?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.178
It's a club.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.764
A bunch of fans

02:17.554 --> 02:18.764
of Captain Man.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.348
And Kid Danger.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.892
Hmm.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.436
It's really hard to get in.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.106
I tried to join and they

02:24.812 --> 02:27.106
wouldn't even take<i> me</i> .

02:28.148 --> 02:30.734
Hey, everyone who's surprised

02:28.148 --> 02:30.734
by that, raise your hand.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.320
Ooh look, no one.

02:36.115 --> 02:37.532
Just be careful.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.366
Why?

02:38.951 --> 02:40.577
Because that girl who's

02:38.951 --> 02:40.577
president of the Man Fans,

02:40.869 --> 02:43.497
uh, Paula Macchiato,

02:40.869 --> 02:43.497
she's mean.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.624
Well, she said

02:43.538 --> 02:45.624
I could join the Man Fans

02:45.666 --> 02:47.459
if I pass my initiation.

02:47.835 --> 02:48.460
Which is?

02:49.252 --> 02:52.756
I got to make a video of me

02:49.252 --> 02:52.756
eating... hair soup.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.092
What kind of soup?

02:55.134 --> 02:56.010
Hair!

02:56.760 --> 02:59.972
I got this big bag of it fresh

02:56.760 --> 02:59.972
from a barbershop floor.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.933
You can't eat soup

03:01.056 --> 03:02.933
with a bunch of hair in it.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.811
Okay, first, the things

03:03.266 --> 03:05.811
you say don't matter.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.648
And second, I am going

03:08.063 --> 03:09.648
to eat the hair soup

03:09.690 --> 03:11.692
so I can join

03:09.690 --> 03:11.692
the Man Fans.

03:12.151 --> 03:12.818
Hold my phone.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.194
And...

03:16.905 --> 03:17.739
Roll video.

03:18.115 --> 03:18.949
Okay.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.534
Go.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.243
Hi, Paula Macchiato.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.288
I want to join

03:23.037 --> 03:25.288
your club so much,

03:25.580 --> 03:27.457
I'm going to eat

03:25.580 --> 03:27.457
a bowl of...

03:30.418 --> 03:31.503
Hair soup.

03:45.100 --> 03:45.893
Can I have some?

03:49.646 --> 03:50.731
It all just

03:49.646 --> 03:50.731
kind of happened.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.983
My dad was

03:51.106 --> 03:52.983
an irresponsible scientist.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.194
I wanted an

03:53.567 --> 03:55.194
after-school job.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.238
(Captain Man)

03:55.485 --> 03:58.238
And by accident,

03:55.485 --> 03:58.238
he made me indestructible.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.364
Ahhh!

03:59.656 --> 04:01.116
(Henry)

03:59.656 --> 04:01.116
I went to

03:59.656 --> 04:01.116
this crazy store

04:01.825 --> 04:03.660
and met a pretty

04:01.825 --> 04:03.660
interesting guy.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.037
I'm going to

04:03.702 --> 04:05.037
blow your mind.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.539
(Captain Man)

04:05.412 --> 04:07.539
Now I protect the good

04:05.412 --> 04:07.539
citizens of Swellview.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.540
Who call me...

04:08.749 --> 04:09.708
(Henry)

04:08.749 --> 04:09.708
He turned out to be...

04:09.958 --> 04:10.918
(Captain Man)

04:09.958 --> 04:10.918
You know the name.

04:10.959 --> 04:11.835
Captain man!

04:12.086 --> 04:12.920
That's right, Henry.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.756
In time, I realized

04:13.336 --> 04:15.756
that being a superhero

04:15.797 --> 04:17.257
is a lot to handle alone.

04:17.549 --> 04:18.383
He wanted some help.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.843
(Captain Man)

04:18.633 --> 04:19.843
I needed a sidekick.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.595
I, Henry Hart...

04:21.636 --> 04:23.013

04:21.636 --> 04:23.013

08:03.066 --> 08:05.110
where do I sit?

08:05.444 --> 08:07.028
Uh...

08:05.444 --> 08:07.028
On your butt.

08:09.697 --> 08:10.907
"On my butt."

08:11.325 --> 08:12.492
That's a good one.

08:13.160 --> 08:13.785
Yeah...

08:15.078 --> 08:16.413
Welcome to the Man Fans,

08:15.078 --> 08:16.413
Piper.

08:16.788 --> 08:17.747
(all talking at once)

08:18.706 --> 08:19.499
Hey!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.918
I'm the president

08:20.167 --> 08:21.918
of the Man Fans

08:21.960 --> 08:24.087
so I say who gets in

08:21.960 --> 08:24.087
and when!

08:24.379 --> 08:25.380
Everyone got that?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.799
(everyone)

08:25.505 --> 08:27.799
Yes, yes ma'am.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.927
But you said

08:28.967 --> 08:30.927
if I made a video of me

08:30.969 --> 08:33.180
eating hair soup

08:30.969 --> 08:33.180
I could be a member.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.806
Well, I changed my mind!

08:35.765 --> 08:36.975
But I ate hair.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.435
So?

08:39.353 --> 08:41.688
You don't want to know what

08:39.353 --> 08:41.688
that hair did to my stomach.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.232
Well, now if

08:42.647 --> 08:44.232
you want to join...

08:45.275 --> 08:49.070
You have to show us a selfie

08:45.275 --> 08:49.070
of you with Captain Man.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.157
But how am I supposed

08:49.737 --> 08:52.157
to find Captain Man?

08:52.491 --> 08:54.117
A real Man fan

08:52.491 --> 08:54.117
can find him.

08:54.951 --> 08:55.618
Right, guys?

08:56.453 --> 08:58.621
(kids murmuring)

09:00.581 --> 09:01.291
All right.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.043
Well, I am

09:01.791 --> 09:03.043
a real Man fan,

09:03.084 --> 09:05.212
and I will get

09:03.084 --> 09:05.212
a selfie with him.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.339
Great.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.339
Now, get out.

09:07.839 --> 09:08.840
I will get out.

09:23.771 --> 09:24.731
Only one chip left.

09:24.772 --> 09:28.527
(wild west duel melody)

09:28.568 --> 09:29.319
Race you for it.

09:30.153 --> 09:30.862
Okay.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.489
I'll try.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.908
♪♪

09:34.949 --> 09:35.909
Hands on the table.

09:37.785 --> 09:38.703
On three.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.997
♪♪♪

09:41.039 --> 09:41.956
One--

09:43.708 --> 09:46.836
Come on!

09:43.708 --> 09:46.836
You. Little. Chip snatcher.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.964
(incoming call alert)

09:50.924 --> 09:52.800
Hey, Gooch.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.800
What's up?

09:52.842 --> 09:53.801
<i>Spoiler alert.</i>

09:54.302 --> 09:56.304
Wait! Don't say anything

09:54.302 --> 09:56.304
about "The Good Wife,"

09:56.346 --> 09:57.514
I'm not caught up yet.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.185
<i>No. My spoiler alert</i>

09:59.224 --> 10:02.185
<i>is about The Spoiler.</i>

10:02.436 --> 10:03.103
Oh.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.067
What do you know

10:07.899 --> 10:09.067
about The Spoiler?

10:09.359 --> 10:10.777
<i>We received a tip</i>

10:09.359 --> 10:10.777
<i>that he's planning to show up</i>

10:10.818 --> 10:13.654
<i>at the Swellview monoplex</i>

10:10.818 --> 10:13.654
<i>tomorrow at midnight.</i>

10:13.905 --> 10:15.740
Hmm.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.740
I wonder why.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.619
Tomorrow night is the worldwide

10:16.366 --> 10:19.619
premiere of "Galaxy Wars 9."

10:20.495 --> 10:21.496
Oh my god.

10:22.456 --> 10:23.457
Thanks, Gooch.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.084
The Spoiler must have

10:24.332 --> 10:26.084
inside information

10:26.126 --> 10:27.294
about what happens

10:26.126 --> 10:27.294
in the movie.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.129
He's going to ruin it

10:27.586 --> 10:29.129
for everyone.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.005
Not if you and me stop him.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.674
Not if you and<i> I</i> stop him.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.218
That's what I said.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.386
You said "you and<i> me</i> ."

10:36.428 --> 10:37.387
Okay, who cares?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.222
We have grammar rules

10:37.845 --> 10:39.222
for a reason.

10:39.264 --> 10:39.889
Hey, guess what?

10:39.931 --> 10:40.557
What?

10:41.141 --> 10:41.849
Ow!

10:41.891 --> 10:42.559
Yeah. There you go.

10:42.934 --> 10:43.810
You know,

10:42.934 --> 10:43.810
I got one, too.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.103
Oh, do you?

10:43.851 --> 10:45.103
Ahh!

10:45.353 --> 10:46.396
Ow!

10:46.813 --> 10:47.564
Hey!

10:47.606 --> 10:48.565
Ow!

10:48.607 --> 10:49.483
Ah!

10:49.524 --> 10:50.400
Oh no,

10:49.524 --> 10:50.400
not the face!

10:50.858 --> 10:52.735
Ahh! Not the butt!

10:50.858 --> 10:52.735
Ahhh!

10:57.407 --> 10:58.366
(Jasper)

10:57.407 --> 10:58.366
Piper?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.410
I'm in Henry's room!

11:03.079 --> 11:04.331
Hey, where's Henry?

11:04.581 --> 11:05.248
I don't know.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.375
But your text said

11:05.915 --> 11:07.375
he needed me fast.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.962
Yeah. Uh, Henry dropped a sock

11:07.708 --> 11:10.962
out of the window

11:11.004 --> 11:12.213
and he wants you

11:11.004 --> 11:12.213
to go get it.

11:12.755 --> 11:13.881
Why do I got to get it?

11:14.257 --> 11:15.883
Just go get the sock.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.260
Okay.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.681
(Jasper)

11:21.222 --> 11:22.681
Yep. That's a sock.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.683
Hey, what are you doing?

11:24.934 --> 11:26.645
Being safe.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.063
If you fall, this rope will keep

11:26.685 --> 11:29.063
you from hitting the ground.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.064
I'm not going to fall.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.985
I don't know.

11:34.027 --> 11:34.693
(bag pops)

11:34.027 --> 11:34.693
(Jasper grunts)

11:34.944 --> 11:36.821
Ahh!

11:37.738 --> 11:38.532
(Jasper groans)

11:38.573 --> 11:39.616
Help me!

11:40.033 --> 11:41.201
Call my mom!

11:41.700 --> 11:44.454
(alarm beeping)

11:46.373 --> 11:49.376
Captain Man emergency hotline.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.376
What is your situation?

11:49.750 --> 11:52.128
My brother's dumb friend

11:49.750 --> 11:52.128
fell out of the window

11:52.170 --> 11:54.005
and now he's dangling.

11:54.047 --> 11:54.881
- (Jasper yells)

11:54.047 --> 11:54.881
Help me!

11:54.922 --> 11:56.257
Send Captain Man.

11:56.715 --> 12:00.053
I'm sorry, but that is not

11:56.715 --> 12:00.053
a Captain Man type of emergency.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.720
Please,

12:00.094 --> 12:01.720
call the Fire Department.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.057
He's not on fire.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.392
- (Jasper yells)

12:04.432 --> 12:05.392
Piper?

12:05.559 --> 12:07.101
I'm sorry,

12:05.559 --> 12:07.101
but we cannot--

12:07.143 --> 12:09.062
Wait. What if I

12:07.143 --> 12:09.062
set him on fire?

12:10.564 --> 12:12.190
Then will Captain Man

12:10.564 --> 12:12.190
come here?

12:12.857 --> 12:13.567
Goodbye.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.152
Dah!

12:20.031 --> 12:21.449
But you don't

12:20.031 --> 12:21.449
understand. See--

12:21.491 --> 12:22.116
<i>Hey.</i>

12:22.741 --> 12:24.536
<i>Who do you think</i>

12:22.741 --> 12:24.536
<i>you are bothering me?</i>

12:24.578 --> 12:26.413
<i>I'm busy.</i>

12:26.454 --> 12:29.082
(Piper)

12:26.454 --> 12:29.082
But I tried to get a selfie

12:26.454 --> 12:29.082
with Captain Man.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.627
I had a great plan,

12:29.457 --> 12:32.627
but it didn't work.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.753
<i>If you want</i>

12:32.919 --> 12:34.753
<i>to join my club,</i>

12:35.088 --> 12:38.466
<i>then get a selfie</i>

12:35.088 --> 12:38.466
<i>with Captain Man!</i>

12:39.259 --> 12:41.969
But I don't know where he is.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.969
How do I find him?

12:42.470 --> 12:43.555
<i>Wah.</i>

12:43.971 --> 12:45.640
<i>"How do I find him?"</i>

12:43.971 --> 12:45.640
<i>Wah.</i>

12:45.682 --> 12:47.016
<i>That's how you sound!</i>

12:48.643 --> 12:50.520
Sorry, I didn't realize.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.273
<i>You see this?</i>

12:54.399 --> 12:57.068
<i>That's how much time you have</i>

12:54.399 --> 12:57.068
<i>o   get a selfie with Captain</i>

12:54.399 --> 12:57.068
<i>Man,</i>

12:57.360 --> 12:59.904
<i>or else you'll never</i>

12:57.360 --> 12:59.904
<i>join the Man Fans.</i>

13:00.363 --> 13:01.531
But...

13:02.907 --> 13:06.160
(melancholic music plays)

13:10.123 --> 13:12.667
Hey, Pipes.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.667
Everything okay?

13:14.419 --> 13:16.713
Yes. I'm not upset.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.713
Now, shut up.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.048
Uh...

13:20.007 --> 13:22.719
I overheard you talking

13:20.007 --> 13:22.719
to that girl from the Man Fans.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.887
So?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.765
Why do you want

13:24.929 --> 13:26.765
to join that club so bad?

13:27.181 --> 13:30.226
Well, I just think

13:27.181 --> 13:30.226
Kid Danger's really cute.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.145
Ugh, kill me.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.856
And every week

13:33.480 --> 13:35.856
the Man Fans get together

13:35.898 --> 13:37.442
and talk about stuff

13:35.898 --> 13:37.442
that Captain Man

13:37.484 --> 13:38.693
and Kid Danger are doing,

13:39.110 --> 13:40.654
and I just want

13:39.110 --> 13:40.654
to be part of it.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.616
But how am I going to get a

13:41.362 --> 13:44.616
stupid selfie with Captain Man?

13:48.995 --> 13:49.788
All right, listen.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.708
I read a rumor online

13:54.000 --> 13:55.543
that Captain Man

13:54.000 --> 13:55.543
might be going to the

13:55.585 --> 13:57.086
"Galaxy Wars" premiere tonight.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.547
Really?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.547
Where online?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.383
Uh, they,

14:00.006 --> 14:02.383
they took it down,

14:02.425 --> 14:04.427
but I saw it and it said

14:02.425 --> 14:04.427
he was going to be there.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.429
Wait.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.390
Where am I

14:07.888 --> 14:09.390
going to get a ticket?

14:10.849 --> 14:11.810
Uh.

14:11.934 --> 14:12.851
Charlotte has

14:11.934 --> 14:12.851
an extra one.

14:13.603 --> 14:14.853
I could ask her

14:13.603 --> 14:14.853
to take you.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.064
Why are you

14:15.730 --> 14:17.064
being nice to me?

14:17.607 --> 14:18.733
Because...

14:19.317 --> 14:20.652
you're my little sister

14:19.317 --> 14:20.652
and I...

14:20.694 --> 14:22.069
I don't know.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.069
Shut up.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.535
Henry, look!

14:26.032 --> 14:28.535
I got your sock!

14:40.672 --> 14:42.423
(chattering)

14:44.008 --> 14:44.843
(Henry)

14:44.008 --> 14:44.843
Hey.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.510
You find anything?

14:45.968 --> 14:47.470
Yeah, I found a great pic--

14:48.680 --> 14:51.015
(cracks up)

14:51.265 --> 14:52.099
What's funny?

14:52.141 --> 14:52.767
All right.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.228
Seriously?

14:53.434 --> 14:55.228
You're gonna make fun of us?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.688
Knock it off.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.688
Come on. Enough.

14:57.063 --> 14:57.856
Okay.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.817
So, you're a skynaut?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.695
A red skynaut.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.281
And I'm...

15:05.029 --> 15:07.281
Duke Starjacker.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.783
(laughs)

15:08.825 --> 15:09.909
Yeah, yeah.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.078
You won't be laughing

15:10.744 --> 15:12.078
when we catch The Spoiler.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.163
Oh, right.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.163
About The Spoiler,

15:14.581 --> 15:16.666
here's a new pic of him

15:14.581 --> 15:16.666
from a month ago.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.337
Got it.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.006
Hey, and you're going to take

15:22.046 --> 15:24.006
Piper to the movie tonight?

15:24.465 --> 15:25.341
Oh, yeah.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.427
It's almost 11:00.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.427
I better go pick her up.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.636
Okay. We'll see you

15:27.468 --> 15:28.636
at the monoplex.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.345
Yep.

15:35.935 --> 15:36.770
<i>Popcorn.</i>

15:39.272 --> 15:40.940
Uh...

15:40.981 --> 15:42.108
What you doing

15:40.981 --> 15:42.108
with that popcorn?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.110
Putting it in

15:42.483 --> 15:44.110
my adventure sack.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.447
You know they sell popcorn

15:45.194 --> 15:47.447
at the movie theater.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.198
Yeah, for like

15:47.697 --> 15:49.198
a billion dollars.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.661
Okay, let's go...

15:50.825 --> 15:53.661
corn smuggler.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.709
Up the tube.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.758
(Ray)

16:05.214 --> 16:06.758
No, my popcorn!

16:06.800 --> 16:08.718
(Henry)

16:06.800 --> 16:08.718
Ha! Your sack has

16:06.800 --> 16:08.718
a hole in it.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.886
Argh!

16:14.849 --> 16:19.395
(chattering)

16:19.771 --> 16:20.897
You see The Spoiler?

16:20.939 --> 16:22.148
No, not yet.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.609
Red Skynaut.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.194
You are the sworn

16:24.901 --> 16:27.194
enemy of Mento.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.949
Sorry.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.949
We don't speak nerd.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.200
Tranya!

16:34.368 --> 16:36.036
You have insulted my tribe.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.998
Now taste

16:36.370 --> 16:38.998
the Tassel of Tinklon.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.840
Why'd you do that?

16:47.423 --> 16:48.257
Mom!

16:48.508 --> 16:50.760
A kid just broke

16:48.508 --> 16:50.760
my glow bat!

16:52.887 --> 16:54.013
How about those

16:52.887 --> 16:54.013
two seats right there?

16:54.054 --> 16:54.722
Cool.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.727
(Henry)

16:58.685 --> 16:59.727
Hey, hey, hey.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.228
See that girl over there?

17:02.438 --> 17:03.356
The one wearing

17:02.438 --> 17:03.356
the me button?

17:04.398 --> 17:07.819
Yeah. That's the president

17:04.398 --> 17:07.819
of our fan club, the Man Fans.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.279
She's the one who's being

17:08.444 --> 17:10.279
really mean to my sister.

17:10.613 --> 17:11.280
Wow.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.282
What?

17:13.324 --> 17:15.284
Her button. That's a

17:13.324 --> 17:15.284
fantastic picture of me--

17:15.326 --> 17:16.494
Oh, let's just

17:15.326 --> 17:16.494
sit down.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.044
Um, where do you

17:23.584 --> 17:25.044
want to sit?

17:25.085 --> 17:25.753
(gasps)

17:26.921 --> 17:28.923
-What?

17:26.921 --> 17:28.923
-That's Paula Macchiato.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.011
Hi, Paula!

17:35.638 --> 17:37.598
'Sup Paula?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.977
Until you get a selfie

17:38.599 --> 17:40.977
with Captain Man,

17:41.019 --> 17:42.854
don't talk to me,

17:41.019 --> 17:42.854
don't look at me,

17:42.896 --> 17:44.772
and don't even think

17:42.896 --> 17:44.772
about sitting with us.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.110
Okay. Sorry.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.240
Okay, I got something

17:51.988 --> 17:54.240
to say to that girl.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.994
Shh. Don't upset her, please.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.994
I need her to like me.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.538
Okay.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.538
But if she looks at me,

18:00.580 --> 18:01.956
I'm going to give her

18:00.580 --> 18:01.956
one of these...

18:07.003 --> 18:07.962
Hey, I want popcorn.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.630
There's none left

18:08.546 --> 18:09.630
in your adventure sack?

18:09.672 --> 18:10.548
You know there's not.

18:12.008 --> 18:12.842
Be right back.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.301
Keep an eye out

18:13.175 --> 18:14.301
for The Spoiler.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.053
You too.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.479
Uhh.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.479
Excuse me!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.066
Hey, people, listen up!

18:29.316 --> 18:30.359
It's The Spoiler!

18:30.610 --> 18:32.445
He's going to ruin everything!

18:33.905 --> 18:36.574
I got some information

18:33.905 --> 18:36.574
about the movie!

18:38.868 --> 18:39.702
Ray?

18:43.831 --> 18:44.791
So, get this...

18:45.291 --> 18:47.334
Quick, everyone do this!

18:45.291 --> 18:47.334
La, la, la.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.420
(everyone)

18:47.376 --> 18:49.420
La, la, la.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.380
No, don't do that!

18:49.462 --> 18:51.380
Hear me!

18:51.714 --> 18:52.673
Hear me!

18:53.132 --> 18:56.052
(everyone)

18:53.132 --> 18:56.052
La, la, la, la...

18:57.386 --> 18:58.178
Hey, you!

18:58.888 --> 18:59.680
What?

19:00.014 --> 19:00.640
Shut up!

19:02.266 --> 19:04.102
It's Kid Danger!

19:06.186 --> 19:07.480
(high pitched screaming)

19:06.186 --> 19:07.480
Oh my God!

19:07.521 --> 19:09.774
We love you, Kid Danger!

19:10.942 --> 19:14.278
Spoiler alert...

19:10.942 --> 19:14.278
I'm about to spoil you.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.156
Yes!

19:14.862 --> 19:17.156
That was the perfect quip!

19:19.075 --> 19:19.784
Get out of here!

19:20.326 --> 19:22.453
(crowd gasps)

19:24.080 --> 19:25.205
(grunting)

19:25.247 --> 19:29.502
(cheering)

19:30.753 --> 19:35.257
(grunting)

19:35.842 --> 19:37.510
(crowd gasping)

19:37.969 --> 19:39.345
Maybe I'll just

19:37.969 --> 19:39.345
break your arm

19:39.386 --> 19:40.805
and then ruin the movie

19:39.386 --> 19:40.805
for everyone.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.184
Get your hands off

19:42.932 --> 19:45.184
Kid Danger!

19:45.476 --> 19:47.937
(screaming)

19:48.771 --> 19:52.441
(cheering)

19:55.611 --> 19:56.737
It's Captain Man!

19:57.030 --> 20:00.282
(cheering)

20:04.954 --> 20:05.955
Calm down.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.709
Go, Piper!

20:09.750 --> 20:10.626
Yeah!

20:12.294 --> 20:13.921
Well, The Spoiler...

20:15.089 --> 20:16.215
I'm about to spoil--

20:16.256 --> 20:17.175
I already quipped that.

20:18.425 --> 20:19.177
Oh.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.931
Kid Danger,

20:21.679 --> 20:23.931
can I have a hug?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.307
Uhhh.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.309
Not right now.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.309
I need to go stand over there.

20:31.856 --> 20:32.815
Move!

20:35.442 --> 20:37.820
Captain Man,

20:35.442 --> 20:37.820
I'm Paula Macchiato,

20:37.862 --> 20:39.655
the president of

20:37.862 --> 20:39.655
your fan club,

20:39.697 --> 20:40.614
the Man Fans.

20:41.115 --> 20:41.991
I'm awesome.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.326
Yeah,

20:42.742 --> 20:44.326
I've heard about you.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.874
What's your name,

20:48.455 --> 20:49.874
little girl?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.876
Piper Hart.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.876
Remember?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.003
One time you shot

20:51.918 --> 20:54.003
an alien off my face?

20:55.171 --> 20:56.756
Oh yeah.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.174
Well, Piper Hart,

20:58.216 --> 21:01.052
you showed extreme bravery

20:58.216 --> 21:01.052
by using this glow bat

21:01.094 --> 21:03.429
to beat The Spoiler

21:01.094 --> 21:03.429
nearly half to death.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.348
Thanks.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.348
I loved it!

21:08.017 --> 21:08.726
And you...

21:09.393 --> 21:11.478
You just sat there

21:09.393 --> 21:11.478
like a pile of nothing.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.108
But... But I was going

21:12.605 --> 21:15.108
to do something.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.192
Wah.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.360
"I was gonna do

21:16.692 --> 21:18.360
something."

21:19.070 --> 21:20.279
That's how you sound.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.782
(laughing)

21:23.074 --> 21:25.785
And now, I, Captain Man,

21:23.074 --> 21:25.785
declare you,

21:25.826 --> 21:28.621
Piper Hart, the new president

21:25.826 --> 21:28.621
of the Man Fans.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.414
(cheering)

21:36.087 --> 21:37.088
I'm okay.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.509
Now what do you say

21:39.757 --> 21:42.509
we all watch "Galaxy Wars 9?"

21:43.177 --> 21:45.179
- Wait! Wait!

21:46.597 --> 21:49.058
As guardian

21:46.597 --> 21:49.058
of the Throne of Krandor,

21:49.100 --> 21:53.520
I challenge both Captain Man

21:49.100 --> 21:53.520
and Kid Danger to the duel--

21:56.023 --> 21:59.652
(cheering)

22:00.360 --> 22:01.279
Hey, what's that?

22:33.477 --> 22:34.270
(bell oven dings)

22:34.312 --> 22:35.146
(Man)

22:34.312 --> 22:35.146
Mmm
