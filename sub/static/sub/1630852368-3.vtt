<i>We all just gotta unplug</i>

00:20.145 --> 00:22.648
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:24.942
<i>Just like the way Doug unplugs</i>

00:26.568 --> 00:28.862
Good morning, everyone!

00:28.946 --> 00:32.698
I've gathered you here to announce a very special surprise.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.160
-Wow. -Is it a trip to the museum?

00:35.244 --> 00:37.913
No. Mega City Restaurant for pancakes?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.165
The duck pond?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.877
Tell us the surprise. Emma's getting floppy.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.923
All right then.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.384
The time has come for the great reveal.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.094
The surprise is

00:52.177 --> 00:54.888
we're going to a play at the Mega City Theater!

00:54.972 --> 00:57.766
-Wonderful! -I knew it!

00:57.850 --> 01:01.645
That's why you're wearing your favorite play-watching bow tie.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.730
I never watch a play without it.

01:04.605 --> 01:07.943
My sensors indicate going to a play must be exciting.

01:08.026 --> 01:11.822
But I've never heard of one before. What is a play, Emma?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.949
Time to give it a plug, Doug.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.958
<i>Want to be entertained</i>

01:23.542 --> 01:26.170
<i>Why not check out a play</i>

01:26.253 --> 01:30.465
<i>Watch actors on stage Tell a story that is made up</i>

01:30.549 --> 01:33.010
<i>A set might include A scene-setting backdrop</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:35.762
<i>Each actor in costume And maybe some props</i>

01:35.846 --> 01:38.432
<i>Live in front of you</i>

01:40.058 --> 01:41.476
<i>Dim the lights Say yeah</i>

01:41.560 --> 01:42.978
<i>You might laugh</i>

01:43.061 --> 01:47.149
<i>It's okay if you cry at the play</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:53.322
<i>If there's a song</i>

01:53.405 --> 01:57.534
<i>You can sing along at the play</i>

02:06.710 --> 02:10.714
I get it. Plays are when people act out a story for an audience.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.342
But I still have a big question.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.427
Why do people go to plays?

02:15.511 --> 02:16.762
Excellent question, Doug.

02:16.845 --> 02:20.474
And you shall find out at this evening's performance.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.144
There's nothing like a perfect Tuesday night at the theater

02:24.228 --> 02:26.438
to bring the whole family together.

02:26.522 --> 02:29.483
Tuesday? But, Dad, it's Wednesday.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.527
Wednesday?

02:31.610 --> 02:34.530
Oh, no! We missed the play!

02:36.281 --> 02:39.660
I'm sorry, everyone. I'll make it up to you.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.288
As soon as I take off my play-watching bow tie.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.874
Oh, Laurence.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.167
Poor Dad.

02:47.251 --> 02:51.213
He loves watching plays almost as much as he loves being in them.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.132
I guess I won't learn about plays today after all.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.719
I know it's disappointing, but you know what Dad always says, Emma.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.721
"No matter what happens"--

02:59.805 --> 03:03.016
"The show must go on!"

03:03.642 --> 03:06.186
Yeah, it must! Our show!

03:06.270 --> 03:10.274
If Dad missed his play, we can put on a play for him instead.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.318
-That's a great idea. -What will the play be about?

03:15.654 --> 03:16.947
My favorite.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.950
The <i>Three Billy Goats Gruff</i>.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.202
Once upon a time,

03:22.286 --> 03:26.290
there were three billy goats who loved to eat grass.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.125
One day, they woke up

03:28.208 --> 03:32.004
and all the grass on their side of the river was gone.

03:32.087 --> 03:35.215
But a grumpy troll, who lived under the bridge,

03:35.299 --> 03:38.594
wouldn't let them cross to the grass on the other side.

03:38.677 --> 03:43.307
So the nice billy goats invited the troll to join them on the other side,

03:43.390 --> 03:44.558
and so he did.

03:44.641 --> 03:50.981
The troll took a nap in the soft grass, while the goats ate and ate.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.109
And they all lived happily ever after.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.111
What a bot-tastic story, Emma.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.280
So let's put on the play.

03:58.363 --> 04:03.076
Doug, Doug, Doug. There's so much we need before we're ready to perform.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.371
A stage, costumes, actors.

04:06.455 --> 04:10.209
Wait a nanosecond. Maybe some of the bots at Rebots can help us out.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.172
Thanks for coming, bots.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.634
Doug said you needed help putting on a play, whatever that is.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.260
So, here we are.

04:20.344 --> 04:25.516
Perfect! And I have a surprise for you.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.644
You're all going to be actors!

04:29.937 --> 04:33.982
Emma, what are actors?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.444
Actors pretend to be characters in the story.

04:37.528 --> 04:40.697
First, we need a grumpy troll.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.658
Who's feeling grumpy today?

04:42.741 --> 04:45.536
Mud! Oh, no, you don't, furry creature!

04:45.619 --> 04:48.497
Don't go dirtying up my nice, clean path.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.124
I think we have our troll.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.545
Great! Now we just need three goats.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.798
With your noble strength, Mr. Forkrick,

04:57.881 --> 05:00.509
and your cool confidence, Jenny,

05:00.592 --> 05:02.636
you'll make great billy goats.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.597
Or should I say botty goats?

05:05.681 --> 05:07.432
Who will play the third goat?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.519
Princess Woofingham!

05:12.312 --> 05:14.481
Now are we ready to put on the play, Emma?

05:14.565 --> 05:15.983
Not quite.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.986
Next we need to make costumes and build a set.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.196
Building and making?

05:21.280 --> 05:24.700
That's what we bots are programmed for. Let's go.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.997
No. Not quite goaty enough.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.082
Let's get this bridge started.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.544
Closer.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.421
Worka, worka.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.132
Worka, worka, worka.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.301
Top of the bridge coming through.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.891
Perfect! Our costumes are ready.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.934
And now for the curtains.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.732
There. Our stage is set.

05:59.359 --> 06:04.531
-Now are we ready to put on the play? -Almost. We just need an audience.

06:04.615 --> 06:05.866
Jenny, you on it?

06:05.949 --> 06:07.492
I'm on it.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.623
Special delivery for Emma's dad and family.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.418
What's this? Tickets for a play?

06:16.502 --> 06:18.462
And this one's tonight?

06:18.545 --> 06:21.632
Come on, family. We're off to...

06:21.715 --> 06:23.509
the backyard?

06:25.344 --> 06:27.262
Surprise!

06:27.346 --> 06:29.181
We're putting on a play for you, Dad.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.935
What a wonderful surprise.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.437
Thank you, Emma Bean and bots.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.731
Oh, this is so thoughtful.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.067
Hold on. Just one thing.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.111
Now we're ready.

06:44.780 --> 06:48.367
Places, everybotty! Get ready to start.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.910
This play is for my dad,

06:49.993 --> 06:52.829
and I really wanna make him happy and proud.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.331
So give it your best,

06:54.414 --> 06:57.501
and no matter what happens, the show must go on.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.337
-Yay, Emma! -Yeah! Emma!

07:00.420 --> 07:01.630
That's my girl.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.882
Welcome, one and all,

07:03.966 --> 07:07.761
to the Backyard Theater Company's performance

07:07.845 --> 07:11.223
of the <i>Three Botty Goats Gruff</i>.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.976
A modern spin on a classic tale.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.687
Without further ado…

07:17.855 --> 07:21.692
Once upon a time, there were three little botty goats.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.528
Remember, Jenny, you're a goat.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.573
You say your line and walk over the bridge.

07:27.656 --> 07:31.159
I'm a goat. First I walk, then I fly.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.620
No, Jenny, you don't fly.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.373
Walk all the way across the bridge.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.749
Got it.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.586
I'm the littlest botty goat.

07:40.669 --> 07:44.840
-And they were really hungry. -And I'm really hungry.

07:45.591 --> 07:46.800
But it looks like

07:46.884 --> 07:50.220
the only green grass is on the other side of this bridge.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.763
Guess I better cross it.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.225
But when the littlest botty goat got to the bridge,

07:55.309 --> 07:57.978
she met a grumpy troll that didn't want her to cross.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.939
Nice to see ya. Welcome to my bridge, botty goat.

08:01.023 --> 08:04.651
Mop Bot, you need to act grumpy.

08:04.735 --> 08:08.447
Grumpy? But I'm not sure what it feels like to be grumpy, Emma,

08:08.530 --> 08:09.740
or a troll.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.825
What if you pretended

08:11.909 --> 08:14.661
that if Jenny gets to the other side of the bridge,

08:14.745 --> 08:17.206
all of Rebots will never be clean again?

08:18.123 --> 08:19.499
Never clean?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.376
Now I'm grumpy.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.421
No problem. Don't even need to walk, Mop Bot.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.799
Jenny. The botty goats don't fly.

08:27.883 --> 08:28.884
Oops!

08:31.094 --> 08:33.679
Ready, Mr. Forkrick? You're on next.

08:33.764 --> 08:34.806
Got it.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.893
Then another hungry botty goat tried to cross the bridge

08:37.976 --> 08:38.977
to get to the green grass.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.938
Who's tryna cross my bridge this time?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.066
-Oh! -Oh, no!

08:44.149 --> 08:46.276
We've got bridge problems!

08:46.360 --> 08:47.402
I've got it.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.073
Sorry.

08:52.658 --> 08:55.494
Emma, was this part of the story?

08:57.079 --> 08:58.080
Where's my bridge?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.751
Wait, Princess Woofingham!

09:02.835 --> 09:04.711
-It's not time yet! -Oh!

09:04.795 --> 09:08.090
And then a third botty goat came to cross the bridge.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.425
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.678
Or to chase a squirrel?

09:12.761 --> 09:15.055
Dirt alert, dirt alert, dirt alert.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.725
My beautiful stage!

09:20.435 --> 09:23.522
Everyone, we're going to take a brief intermission.

09:23.605 --> 09:29.319
Oh, I wanted to put on a good play for my dad, but now it's a disaster.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.614
-We're really sorry, Emma. -Yeah.

09:32.698 --> 09:37.119
It's not your fault. I should have let you practice more.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.539
Sorry, bots, we have to cancel the show.

09:40.622 --> 09:44.168
Cancel? But, Emma, what about what you told us?

09:44.251 --> 09:47.713
-No matter what happens-- -The show must go on.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.048
Yeah. You bots are right.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.635
Even though things aren't going the way we wanted,

09:53.719 --> 09:55.804
the audience came for a show.

09:55.888 --> 09:59.516
But how can we finish the play without a set?

10:01.393 --> 10:04.688
Having bots for actors sure has its perks.

10:04.771 --> 10:09.067
Places, everyone! The show must go on!

10:09.151 --> 10:10.694
-You said it! -Let's do this!

10:10.777 --> 10:14.698
Okay, now two little botty goats made it over the bridge,

10:14.781 --> 10:18.410
but when the final goat tried to pass, the troll stopped him.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.163
You'll never get across my bridge.

10:21.246 --> 10:25.834
But I just wanna join my botty goats on the other side.

10:25.918 --> 10:29.922
Would you like to join us and take a nice nap in the green grass?

10:30.005 --> 10:33.759
Join you? No one's ever invited me to join them before.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.386
I can't be grumpy about that.

10:36.470 --> 10:40.766
So the little botty goat and the troll walked over the bridge together.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.560
Bravo! Brava!

10:43.644 --> 10:48.232
And they all lived happily ever after.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.734
Bravissimo!

10:51.860 --> 10:55.364
We did it! We made my dad smile.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.825
Oh! What a cast! What a show!

10:58.909 --> 11:02.371
Thanks, Dad. It didn't totally work out the way we planned.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.374
But I was on the edge of my seat!

11:05.457 --> 11:06.750
I laughed. I cried.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.086
And you grabbed my hand when the troll showed up.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.922
And I finally learned why you go to see a play.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.967
Because even if it doesn't go the way you planned,

11:15.050 --> 11:17.678
a play still makes the people watching smile.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.638
It made us smile too.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.893
Especially Princess Woofingham.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.029
What's that?

11:37.072 --> 11:40.284
-What you got there, Doug? -I'm not sure, Uncle Forkrick.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.494
I've never seen a book like this before.

11:42.578 --> 11:45.747
And I've never seen a human that looks like that either.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.625
-Ask Emma? -Ask Emma.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.299
Doug! What brings you here?

11:56.008 --> 11:58.969
Is that a Dana Dash comic book?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.679
Who's Dana Dash?

12:00.762 --> 12:05.058
Only the world's fastest and greatest hero ever created

12:05.142 --> 12:07.769
in the history of comic books.

12:07.853 --> 12:11.648
She sounds bot-tastic! But what's a hero?

12:11.732 --> 12:13.358
I'll plug in and find out.

12:16.195 --> 12:18.697
<i>From comic books to movie screens</i>

12:18.780 --> 12:21.408
<i>Heroes are in so many great stories</i>

12:21.491 --> 12:24.578
<i>Using superpowers to save the day</i>

12:24.661 --> 12:27.122
<i>We need more heroes</i>

12:27.206 --> 12:29.958
<i>Do you know a hero</i>

12:30.042 --> 12:33.837
<i>Who can help us make sure Everyone's okay?</i>

12:34.379 --> 12:36.423
<i>Yeah, I think we need you</i>

12:37.716 --> 12:41.386
<i>So put on your hero mask and suit</i>

12:42.471 --> 12:44.973
<i>We'll call you by Any name that you choose</i>

12:45.057 --> 12:47.309
<i>Show how fast that you can run</i>

12:47.392 --> 12:49.686
<i>Shout your catchphrase When you're done</i>

12:49.770 --> 12:51.730
<i>We'll tell your story</i>

12:51.813 --> 12:56.193
<i>Now we know that you'll be our hero</i>

12:57.569 --> 12:59.738
Wow! Heroes are amazing.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.990
But I still have a big question.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.284
How could we become heroes?

13:04.368 --> 13:07.538
You came to the right human, Doug,

13:07.621 --> 13:11.708
because I know exactly how we can become heroes.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.796
In fact, we'll become Mega City's greatest hero team.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.589
To the Emma Cave!

13:17.673 --> 13:19.299
That's my bedroom.

13:19.883 --> 13:25.514
Okay, Doug, if we're gonna be heroes, the first thing we need are hero costumes.

13:25.597 --> 13:26.974
Hero costumes?

13:27.057 --> 13:30.227
You'll see. Let's suit up.

13:39.528 --> 13:43.532
We are the superest looking hero team ever!

13:43.615 --> 13:45.450
Are we ready to be heroes now?

13:45.534 --> 13:49.037
Almost. We just need to come up with our hero names.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.455
Then we go save the city.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.375
You mean like Doug?

13:54.126 --> 13:56.461
It could be just Doug,

13:56.545 --> 14:00.591
but what about a name that has something to do with your outfit

14:00.674 --> 14:02.217
or what you do best?

14:02.301 --> 14:05.679
Like Dana Dash wears super-fast shoes.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.639
How stylishly speedy.

14:07.723 --> 14:12.311
And that's why we call her Super-Fast Dana Dash.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.271
Now let's see.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.858
I'm wearing a helmet to protect me from all the daring things I do

14:17.941 --> 14:21.695
and a tutu because I'm an excellent dancer.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.281
So I am...

14:25.115 --> 14:26.992
the Daring Dancer!

14:27.075 --> 14:28.577
Now it's your turn, Doug.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.915
Okay. I'm wearing a bow tie and I'm a robot

14:32.998 --> 14:35.501
and I'm a robot wearing a bow tie.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.003
So I am Bow Tie Bot?

14:38.962 --> 14:40.839
Simple, yet effective.

14:40.923 --> 14:41.965
I love it!

14:42.049 --> 14:48.764
Together we are… Bow Tie Bot and the Daring Dancer!

14:48.847 --> 14:55.687
Oh, yeah! This hero team is ready to go play outside!

14:57.272 --> 15:00.776
Whoosh! Whoosh!

15:00.859 --> 15:01.944
Whoosh!

15:02.027 --> 15:04.821
Emma, why are we whooshing?

15:05.989 --> 15:09.243
'Cause we're twirling and flying like heroes, Doug.

15:09.326 --> 15:12.996
Wait. I forgot the most important step to being a hero.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.957
Superpowers!

15:15.040 --> 15:17.292
Superpowers? What are those?

15:17.376 --> 15:21.547
They're awesome things heroes can do that regular humans can't.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.508
Dana Dash has super speed. Check it out!

15:24.591 --> 15:29.012
She's so fast, she can dash kids to school on time if they miss the bus.

15:29.096 --> 15:34.560
She can even catch a speeding baby cheetah and return it to her mommy cheetah.

15:34.643 --> 15:35.894
Incredible!

15:35.978 --> 15:39.314
I bet she can even run faster than Princess Woofingham does

15:39.398 --> 15:41.024
when I put food in her bowl.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.693
That is fast.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.529
But how are we going to figure out our superpowers?

15:46.154 --> 15:48.282
Oh, no! My ball!

15:49.491 --> 15:50.617
What'll I do?

15:50.701 --> 15:52.619
How can we help you, young boy?

15:52.703 --> 15:55.831
Young boy? I'm your age.

15:55.914 --> 15:59.418
-I know. Hello, Gary. -Hi, Emma.

15:59.501 --> 16:05.757
Uh-uh-uh. I'm not Emma. I am… the Daring Dancer!

16:05.841 --> 16:09.219
Oh, sorry. Hi, Daring Dancer.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.263
Do you know how to get my ball back?

16:12.055 --> 16:14.641
Don't worry. I'm on it.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.228
Here's your ball, youthful Gary.

16:18.312 --> 16:19.730
Whoops!

16:34.620 --> 16:36.914
Now that's how you hero.

16:37.748 --> 16:38.832
Thanks.

16:38.916 --> 16:42.211
I never would've gotten my ball back without you.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.378
Who are you?

16:43.462 --> 16:44.963
It's me, Doug.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.216
Doug! It is you.

16:47.299 --> 16:53.263
But today he's Bow Tie Bot. Mega City's newest hero!

16:53.347 --> 16:54.806
Say your catchphrase, Doug.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.391
What's a catchphrase, Emma?

16:56.475 --> 17:01.313
I know. A catchphrase is a cool thing you say before you save the day.

17:01.396 --> 17:05.692
Like Dana Dash says, "Dashing off to save the day."

17:05.776 --> 17:08.862
And then she dashes off to save the day!

17:09.445 --> 17:11.865
My catchphrase. Okay.

17:11.949 --> 17:18.247
How about, "I'm Bow Tie Bot. Check out my turbo boosters."

17:18.329 --> 17:19.414
Not bad.

17:19.498 --> 17:23.335
I'm Bow Tie Bot and I have a bow tie.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.711
A little on the nose.

17:24.795 --> 17:29.675
I'm Bow Tie Bot and I'm dressed to save you from this mess.

17:29.758 --> 17:32.469
Yes! That's it! That's the one!

17:32.553 --> 17:35.389
I dance in super joy!

17:36.390 --> 17:40.394
I'm gonna tell people that there's a new hero in Mega City.

17:40.477 --> 17:45.190
Hey, people! There's a new hero in Mega City!

17:45.274 --> 17:47.401
You're a real hero, Doug.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.571
You've got superpowers and a catchphrase.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.699
What are your superpowers, Emma?

17:53.782 --> 17:56.034
I'm not sure, Doug.

17:56.535 --> 17:59.496
But I know how we can figure it out.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.165
With a superpower test.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.376
To the backyard!

18:06.128 --> 18:07.629
Ready to pour, Doug?

18:07.713 --> 18:11.091
Ready. But why am I pouring dog food again?

18:11.175 --> 18:15.220
Well, we know that Dana Dash's superpower's super speed.

18:15.304 --> 18:20.309
I figure if I can beat Princess Woofingham to the bowl after you pour in her food,

18:20.392 --> 18:22.477
then I have super speed too.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.521
Pour on three.

18:24.605 --> 18:28.734
-One, two… -Three.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.072
Go, Daring Dancer! Go!

18:38.827 --> 18:42.539
Looks like Princess Woofingham has super speed, but not me.

18:42.623 --> 18:46.376
That's okay. There are other superpowers we can test for. Right?

18:46.460 --> 18:47.920
Yeah, there are.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.714
Let's go, Bow Tie Bot. To the front yard.

18:51.924 --> 18:53.634
Now for the strength test.

18:53.717 --> 18:55.552
The strength test, Daring Dancer?

18:55.636 --> 18:57.554
Yes, the strength test, Bow Tie Bot.

18:57.638 --> 19:01.808
I figure if I can push this full reboot bin across the sidewalk,

19:01.892 --> 19:05.479
then I have super strength. Here goes.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.987
Wait, I can do this.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.493
You got this, Emma. Keep pushing.

19:23.872 --> 19:26.917
I was sure super strength would've been my superpower,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.253
but I can't even move this bin.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.129
Wait. "Move."

19:31.213 --> 19:36.260
I once read a comic book where a hero can move things with his mind.

19:36.343 --> 19:40.389
He just focused super hard, and it moved.

19:40.472 --> 19:44.059
Prepare for a hero mind move.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.272
You got this, Daring Dancer.

19:50.816 --> 19:56.405
Doug, I'm doing it. I'm moving it with the power of my mind!

19:56.488 --> 19:58.532
What a superpower.

19:59.283 --> 20:01.326
-Yeah! -Yeah, Emma!

20:01.410 --> 20:04.663
Well, thank you. Just doing my job.

20:04.746 --> 20:09.001
Thank you. Anyway, I better get this bin back to Rebots.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.961
Love the tutu!

20:12.421 --> 20:15.424
Oh, Doug. Doug, Doug, Doug.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.343
I don't think we're gonna find my superpower.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.012
Guess I'm no hero.

20:20.095 --> 20:24.558
We can't give up now. Bow Tie Bot needs the Daring Dancer by his side.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.853
We're Mega City's greatest hero team. Remember?

20:27.936 --> 20:32.858
Sorry, Bow Tie Bot. You'll have to save Mega City without me.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.236
Daring Dancer, wait!

20:38.030 --> 20:39.364
I got ya, Dad.

20:42.618 --> 20:45.204
Emma Bean, you're my hero.

20:45.871 --> 20:49.082
Wait, I'm your hero?

20:49.166 --> 20:50.667
You most certainly are.

20:50.751 --> 20:55.255
Dinner would've been ruined, and then you twirled in out of nowhere!

20:55.339 --> 20:59.218
Our spaghetti sauce is saved!

20:59.301 --> 21:03.055
Emma! I finally learned how we can become heroes.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.723
We can help someone in need.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.434
You helped your dad by saving the groceries,

21:07.518 --> 21:10.187
and I helped your neighbor by rescuing his ball.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.981
So helping is our superpower.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.859
That means we're both heroes.

21:15.943 --> 21:17.945
I think it's time to say your catchphrase.

21:19.238 --> 21:25.536
I'm the Daring Dancer, saving the day one twirl at a time.

21:25.619 --> 21:26.703
Good one, Emma!

21:26.787 --> 21:30.541
Daring Dancer, Mega City needs a hero like you.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.334
Don't forget Bow Tie Bot.

21:32.417 --> 21:36.213
He's the hero for helping me try to find my superpowers,

21:36.296 --> 21:38.215
even when I almost gave up.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.633
I learn from the best.

21:41.051 --> 21:43.679
So what should we do next, Daring Dancer?

21:43.762 --> 21:47.057
We need to find someone who needs our help.

21:48.517 --> 21:50.978
I've got a super idea!

21:52.563 --> 21:57.067
Oh, how am I ever going to put all these groceries away before dinner?

21:57.150 --> 22:00.195
Does somebody need some help?

22:00.279 --> 22:05.075
Bow Tie Bot and the Daring Dancer are here to save the day.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.795
Incredible!

22:17.713 --> 22:20.924
What a heroic putting away of the groceries.

22:21.008 --> 22:24.052
A million thanks, heroes.

22:24.136 --> 22:27.681
No need to thank us. We're just doing what heroes do.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.224
And if you ever need help--

22:29.308 --> 22:34.146
Just call for Bow Tie Bot and the Daring Dancer!

22:34.229 --> 22:35.272
Whoosh!

22:35.856 --> 22:37.232
<i>We need you</i>

22:38.275 --> 22:42.029
<i>So put on your hero mask and suit</i>

22:43.071 --> 22:45.866
<i>We'll call you by any name That you choose</i>

22:45.949 --> 22:47.784
<i>Show how fast that you can run</i>

22:47.868 --> 22:50.662
<i>Shout your catchphrase When you're done</i>

22:50.746 --> 22:52.581
<i>We'll tell your story</i>

22:52.664 --> 22:57.377
<i>Now we know that you'll be our hero</i>

23:03.884 --> 23:06.303
<i>That you'll be our hero</i>
