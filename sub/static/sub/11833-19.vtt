LINDSAY DOLE:
Previously on "The Practice"...

00:02.735 --> 00:05.338
Can you tell me the crime
your son's been convicted of?

00:05.371 --> 00:07.173
He's on death row
in Pennsylvania.

00:07.207 --> 00:09.610
He is to be executed
in five weeks.

00:09.643 --> 00:10.511
He was convicted of raping

00:10.544 --> 00:13.313
and killing his girlfriend,
Alisa Kearns,

00:13.346 --> 00:14.280
then killing her mother.

00:14.314 --> 00:15.516
Any DNA?

00:15.549 --> 00:18.218
They didn't do
full DNA analysis back then.

00:18.251 --> 00:20.053
This is Ellenor Frutt.

00:20.086 --> 00:21.021
ELLENOR: Hello.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.156
She says you can do something.
Can you really?

00:23.423 --> 00:25.258
Would you support me
in my efforts

00:25.291 --> 00:27.493
to try to determine where
the rape kit could have gone?

00:27.528 --> 00:28.629
Of course,
but, Ms. Frutt,

00:28.662 --> 00:31.397
Mr. Donovan was rightly
convicted of a double homicide.

00:31.431 --> 00:34.835
He did not commit
that crime.
All right.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.770
"Steven"...
"Alisa"?

00:36.803 --> 00:39.305
Yes, that's it--
Alisa.
32665.

00:39.339 --> 00:41.842
Yeah, that's
the file number.
We've got it.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.244
New evidence is one thing,

00:44.277 --> 00:48.414
but the re-evaluation of old
evidence is quite another.

00:48.448 --> 00:51.618
I am only asking that
you authorize a DNA test.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.086
The petition is denied.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.455
She just doesn't know
when to quit.

00:55.488 --> 00:58.391
Well, I guess she and I
have something in common then,

00:58.424 --> 00:59.593
because I'm not quitting.

01:04.297 --> 01:07.167
Okay, the Pennsylvania
supreme court

01:07.200 --> 01:08.201
turned us down last night,

01:08.234 --> 01:10.671
which means we have to go
to federal circuit court

01:10.704 --> 01:13.339
under what's called
a successor petition.

01:13.373 --> 01:14.708
Just to get the DNA test?

01:15.542 --> 01:17.077
It gets worse.

01:18.278 --> 01:19.245
Since his last lawyer

01:19.279 --> 01:21.214
previously filed
a habeas petition,

01:21.648 --> 01:23.884
under federal law
we don't get another chance

01:23.917 --> 01:26.186
unless we can pretty much
prove that he's innocent

01:26.720 --> 01:30.223
and that his constitutional
rights were violated.

01:30.256 --> 01:30.957
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.292
We're trying to get
the DNA test

01:32.325 --> 01:33.827
in order to prove
that he's innocent,

01:33.860 --> 01:35.428
but we can't get that test

01:35.461 --> 01:37.497
unless we prove
that he's innocent first?

01:37.531 --> 01:38.699
Right.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.900
How the hell can that be?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.535
I don't know,

01:41.568 --> 01:44.437
but Stuart Donovan is set
to be put to death in 17 days.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.640
So, that means
between now and then

01:46.673 --> 01:49.576
we have to somehow prove
that he's innocent.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.717
This sounds worse
than California.

01:57.383 --> 02:01.187
(music playing)

02:45.431 --> 02:47.400
(indistinct chatter)

02:48.735 --> 02:50.270
(horn blows in distance)

02:51.337 --> 02:53.907
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Donnell?

02:53.940 --> 02:55.041
Yes.

02:55.075 --> 02:58.579
My name is Arthur Turner,
and this is my wife, Gertrude.

02:58.612 --> 02:59.479
Hello.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.982
I'm afraid
we're in a bit of trouble.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.717
What kind of trouble?

03:03.750 --> 03:05.552
It's my daughter.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.688
We were recently married,
and my stepdaughter

03:07.721 --> 03:09.422
is trying to get
the marriage annulled.

03:09.455 --> 03:10.957
There's a hearing
scheduled for today.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.793
Mr. Turner,
this is Lindsay Dole.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.562
She heads up our domestic
relations department.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.598
Lindsay, this is Arthur Turner,
his wife Gertrude.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.331
Hello.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.333
Bobby,
on that Lujack matter--

03:20.366 --> 03:21.835
I'll handle
the Lujack deposition.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.837
Help the Turners.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.806
If they're able
to get this annulled,

03:25.839 --> 03:28.008
which they are trying
to do...
Rebecca?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.376
Actually, sir, we have
an annulment specialist.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.477
Could you help the Turners?

03:31.512 --> 03:32.946
Their marriage is being
threatened with annulment.

03:32.979 --> 03:35.616
The hearing's today.
I have a Lujack conflict.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.384
I'm actually helping Bobby
on the Lujack matter.

03:38.418 --> 03:39.052
Thank you.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.486
Ms. Washington
will help you.

03:43.389 --> 03:46.426
This Lujack sounds
like a really big client.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.904
I can't possibly thank you
enough for coming.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.405
Come on,
I'll show you the room,

03:59.439 --> 04:00.641
and we can get started.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.755
Oh, my god.

04:15.388 --> 04:16.822
Oh, sorry.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.793
I don't even
notice those anymore.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.427
After 12 years--

04:21.461 --> 04:23.029
I have a meeting
with the informant at 1:00.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.065
Eugene's going
to see the eyewitness.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.068
Good luck trying to get
the time of day with him.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.570
What about the father?
Are you--

04:29.603 --> 04:31.004
Jimmy is going to try.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.840
I can't tell you
how grateful I am.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.842
We can't get
our hopes up, Mary.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.511
I keep trying
to tell you this.

04:37.544 --> 04:38.745
Let's just get to work.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.522
An annulment
is kind of a drastic measure.

04:48.555 --> 04:49.389
I just thought--

04:49.422 --> 04:50.891
where is my mother now?

04:50.924 --> 04:51.625
She's with her husband.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.760
Her husband?
He's nothing but--

04:53.794 --> 04:56.997
Claire.
No,
I'll say my say.

04:57.030 --> 05:00.366
You're no better than he is,
taking advantage of old--

05:00.400 --> 05:03.804
I am not taking advantage
of anyone, ma'am,

05:03.837 --> 05:05.772
and I will thank you
not to draw conclusions

05:05.806 --> 05:07.574
about who and what I am.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.910
You're a lawyer.
That's all I need to know.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.011
Claire, that's enough.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.114
According to Mr. Turner,

05:14.147 --> 05:15.882
he loves your mother
very much.
Oh, right.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.719
She lacked the capacity
to enter into a contract,

05:18.752 --> 05:20.587
marital or--
How do you figure?

05:20.621 --> 05:21.788
Duress?
What are the grounds?

05:21.822 --> 05:24.357
She has Alzheimer's,
Ms. Washington.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.528
You didn't know this?

05:28.562 --> 05:34.100
Your client married
a woman with Alzheimer's.

05:34.134 --> 05:38.471
So? It's illegal
for somebody with Alzheimer's

05:38.505 --> 05:39.372
to get married?

05:40.273 --> 05:42.676
Well, it does raise
some capacity issues.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.645
(sighs)

05:44.678 --> 05:45.979
So, what's going
to happen?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.413
There's going
to be a hearing.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.616
Mr. Turner, you'll have
to take the stand.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.051
I think they plan
on calling a doctor.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.486
And then, Mrs. Turner,
you'll have to testify.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.856
No, I won't let her
be put through that.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.525
She has to demonstrate
to the court

05:58.559 --> 06:00.661
that she was competent
to get married.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.997
If Claire were concerned
about her mother's welfare,

06:04.030 --> 06:07.067
she wouldn't have stuck her
in that nursing home.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.870
Now, she's not going
to be put through testimony.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.171
I'm afraid
that she has no--

06:11.204 --> 06:12.739
I said no.

06:13.106 --> 06:17.110
Mr. Turner,
you hired me to help you.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.513
If you plan to keep this
marriage from being annulled,

06:19.546 --> 06:21.715
your wife
will have to testify.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.651
I can do it, sweetheart.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.052
All I have to do

06:26.086 --> 06:31.057
is show them
that I'm continent.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.093
It's competent.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.596
Yes.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.399
We should get in.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.671
(indistinct chatter)

06:49.676 --> 06:50.744
Mr. Bresler...

06:52.613 --> 06:53.680
I appreciate
you taking the time.

06:53.714 --> 06:57.017
Yeah, um, like I said,
I only got a couple of minutes.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.890
Your house is right across
from the Kearns'?

07:03.924 --> 07:07.628
Was. I, uh, got divorced
and moved about six years ago.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.963
Well, in any case,

07:09.996 --> 07:11.732
going to that night,

07:11.765 --> 07:13.667
you can be sure
it was Stuart Donovan

07:13.700 --> 07:15.802
you saw go
into that house?
Positive.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.004
Can you tell me how
you happened to see him?

07:18.805 --> 07:20.541
I was watching
"Johnny Carson"

07:20.574 --> 07:23.544
when I, uh,
see his Camaro pull up.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.813
It was red with big tires
and mag wheels.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.215
It was always making
a lot of noise, day and night.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.818
So, you actually saw
Stuart get out of the car?

07:31.852 --> 07:34.655
Yes.
Well, he said
he left around 9:00.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.089
Impossible.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.592
It was between
11:30 and 12:00.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.493
I told you
I was watching "Carson."

07:40.527 --> 07:42.896
Well, did you hear any screams
come from the house?

07:42.929 --> 07:44.230
No.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.569
You know he's going
to be executed in two weeks?

07:49.770 --> 07:50.804
Yes.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.073
It's been on the news.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.041
Well, given that,
is there any chance

07:55.075 --> 07:57.711
it wasn't Stuart Donovan
you saw that night?

07:59.179 --> 08:03.784
Mr. Young, I met the kid
a few times back then.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.520
He seemed like
a real nice boy.

08:06.553 --> 08:09.155
I'm not saying he did
what they said he did,

08:09.189 --> 08:11.625
but he did go in there
that night.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.226
There's no question
about that.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.034
Mr. Turner, how long
have you known your wife?

08:21.067 --> 08:23.203
Over 35 years.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.874
I knew her late husband.
They both knew my first wife.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.910
I guess the question
that people are asking--

08:31.645 --> 08:32.913
she has Alzheimer's.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.881
I fell in love with her
long before

08:34.914 --> 08:37.317
she was stricken with that.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.820
It certainly doesn't
make me stop loving her.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.823
Okay,
but it might stop you

08:42.856 --> 08:45.091
from being able
to care for her.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.560
If that day comes,

08:46.593 --> 08:50.897
I might have to consider
putting her in a home.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.934
But that day is not now,
Claire.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.001
I'll tell you that.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.870
You don't know what you're
talking about, Arthur.

08:56.903 --> 08:57.804
I would never--

08:57.838 --> 08:58.972
Ms. Stevens, sit.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.944
Mr. Turner,
please do not address her.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.179
She's upset because
I took her out of the home.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.014
Yes, she is.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.116
She thinks you married her
to gain guardianship

09:10.150 --> 09:11.718
so, you could remove her
from the home.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.154
I married her
because I love her,

09:15.288 --> 09:17.123
and as a person
who loves her,

09:17.157 --> 09:18.692
I wanted her
out of that place--

09:18.725 --> 09:19.660
damn right.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.864
You snuck a minister
into the nursing home,

09:23.897 --> 09:25.198
where he performed
the wedding service?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.000
Yes, I did.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.169
And you have control
of your wife's estate now,

09:29.202 --> 09:30.036
don't you, Mr. Turner?

09:30.070 --> 09:33.173
If Claire wanted
her mother to be happy,

09:33.206 --> 09:35.075
she would want her
to be with me.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.043
She wants her mother
properly cared for.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.779
And I'm doing that!

09:38.812 --> 09:40.113
She has Alzheimer's.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.315
You're a 76-year-old man
with no training--

09:42.348 --> 09:43.984
I can do better
than they can.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.686
That isn't true.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.621
You're ill-equipped
to provide care--

09:47.654 --> 09:49.322
I can take care of her!

09:49.355 --> 09:50.290
GERTRUDE: you!

09:51.357 --> 09:52.859
Stop it.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.103
Mrs. Turner, who is he?

10:04.370 --> 10:05.672
What's his name?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.014
She is not a witness here.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.117
No, she isn't, but the court
certainly would like to know

10:17.150 --> 10:18.318
if she can answer
the question.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.689
Mrs. Turner, who is this man?

10:24.758 --> 10:25.959
Do you know him?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.897
Of course, I do.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.232
Who is he?

10:40.473 --> 10:44.010
His name is Arthur Turner.

10:44.945 --> 10:48.849
He is my lawfully
wedded husband,

10:48.882 --> 10:50.984
and I would appreciate it

10:51.017 --> 10:56.256
if all of you would leave
the two of us alone.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.476
I've been having
these dreams lately.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.344
What sort of dreams?

11:19.746 --> 11:22.415
That I'm asleep,
and I can't wake up.

11:22.448 --> 11:26.386
Then I start thinking
they've already done it.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.722
I'm dead, and this is what
it feels like.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.058
Yeah.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.029
I have a meeting
with the informant

11:36.062 --> 11:36.797
in 45 minutes.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.733
I don't really expect him
to help me

11:39.766 --> 11:41.467
unless he figures
there's something

11:41.502 --> 11:42.636
we can give him.

11:42.669 --> 11:47.440
Okay. Can you make them
stop with the priest?
I'm sorry?

11:47.473 --> 11:49.943
This priest keeps
coming to see me.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.913
He says it's important that
I confess to God before I go.

11:52.946 --> 11:53.847
I'll deal with that.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.382
He says it's my only chance
for absolution.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.852
I will take care
of the priest.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.287
Stuart,
don't talk to anybody,

12:01.321 --> 12:03.156
not even Clergy.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.927
Most of the time she's lucid,

12:06.960 --> 12:08.328
but she does suffer bouts

12:08.361 --> 12:10.864
of both confusion
and delusion.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.398
And, doctor,
does her condition

12:12.432 --> 12:13.534
stand to improve?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.068
No.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.537
It's a progressive disease.

12:16.570 --> 12:20.106
Her cognitive abilities
will eventually erode,

12:20.140 --> 12:21.908
probably completely.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.044
What about care?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.879
I think she's already
at a point where she needs

12:25.912 --> 12:28.381
full-time supervision
by a professional staff.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.351
To entrust her to the care
of a 76-year-old man

12:31.384 --> 12:32.853
with no training--

12:32.886 --> 12:34.187
that's a threat
to her safety.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.089
Does she seem

12:36.122 --> 12:38.191
to have deteriorated
since she left the home?

12:38.224 --> 12:39.893
It's only been a month.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.262
I'll ask
the question again.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.230
Does she seem
to have deteriorated

12:44.264 --> 12:45.431
since she left the home?

12:45.465 --> 12:47.000
No.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.802
When you talk
about the welfare

12:48.835 --> 12:49.970
or well-being of a patient,

12:50.003 --> 12:53.306
whether or not she's happy
or depressed, is that a factor?

12:53.339 --> 12:54.474
Of course.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.877
And if Mrs. Turner
were happier

12:56.910 --> 12:58.444
living with Mr. Turner,

12:58.478 --> 13:02.182
that is something to consider
medically as well, isn't it?

13:02.215 --> 13:04.551
It's not the only thing
to consider, and given--

13:04.585 --> 13:06.186
my question is,

13:06.219 --> 13:09.389
isn't it possible she would
be better off living with him,

13:09.422 --> 13:11.257
especially
when he loves her?

13:11.858 --> 13:14.528
The likelihood of him being
able to take care of her

13:14.561 --> 13:15.662
is so remote--

13:15.696 --> 13:20.066
but if you were satisfied that
he could take care of her,

13:20.100 --> 13:21.935
she's better off
living with him

13:21.968 --> 13:24.337
than in a nursing home,
isn't she?

13:24.370 --> 13:28.575
It's a very big if...
but probably yes.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.443
Thank you, doctor.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.891
(door opens)

13:45.391 --> 13:46.259
Mr. Kearns?

13:47.093 --> 13:47.761
Yes.

13:47.794 --> 13:50.430
My name
is James Berluti, sir.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.632
As I'm sure you know,

13:51.665 --> 13:53.934
Stuart Donovan
is soon to be executed

13:53.967 --> 13:56.336
for the murder
of your wife and daughter.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.337
And?

13:57.370 --> 14:01.274
At the risk of you slamming
the door in my face,

14:01.307 --> 14:04.144
I've been hired
by Stuart's mother.

14:04.177 --> 14:09.082
If I could, and I know
how offensive this must seem,

14:09.115 --> 14:12.118
I'd like to ask you
just a couple of questions.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.924
I was working
the graveyard shift,

14:17.958 --> 14:20.026
but I remember before I left

14:20.060 --> 14:22.295
my wife trying
to calm Alisa down.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.130
Do you know why?

14:24.164 --> 14:27.000
Alisa had broken up
with Stuart

14:27.033 --> 14:28.602
a few days before,

14:28.635 --> 14:30.904
and he was calling
and harassing her.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.007
She was pretty upset.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.245
I didn't take it
seriously enough,

14:39.279 --> 14:40.547
and when I came home,

14:41.948 --> 14:43.349
I saw what he had done
to her.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.388
This may be the part
that sounds offensive,

14:48.421 --> 14:51.257
but can you think
of anybody else

14:51.291 --> 14:53.927
who may have wanted
to harm your daughter

14:53.960 --> 14:55.095
or your wife?

14:56.296 --> 15:00.266
Mr. Berluti, I understand.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.037
As a parent, Mary Donovan
will do anything

15:04.070 --> 15:06.072
to prevent
her son's execution.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.243
But you tell her for me--

15:10.276 --> 15:12.245
and as a parent,
she should understand

15:12.278 --> 15:15.582
that I won't feel any peace

15:15.616 --> 15:18.151
until the person who raped
and murdered my daughter

15:18.184 --> 15:20.353
is put to death,

15:20.386 --> 15:21.722
and you can tell her
I'll see her soon

15:21.755 --> 15:25.358
because I plan to be there.

15:25.391 --> 15:28.161
I plan to be there
for his final breath,

15:28.194 --> 15:31.364
just like he was for my wife
and daughter's.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.401
I understand
you want closure, sir,

15:36.737 --> 15:40.006
but if he didn't do it...

15:40.040 --> 15:42.175
when they execute him,
that's it.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.945
They got the real killer,
Mr. Berluti.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.387
I don't want her
testifying.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.321
Mr. Turner...

15:55.355 --> 15:58.291
it's not hard
to get her confused, Rebecca.

15:58.324 --> 15:59.392
They're just going to--

15:59.425 --> 16:03.263
the judge has made it clear
he needs to hear from her.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.766
I'll try my best to protect her,
but she has to testify.

16:05.799 --> 16:09.469
Why don't you two
stop your fussing?

16:09.503 --> 16:13.106
He's not going to hurt me
with everybody watching.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.708
Frank is just
a big coward

16:14.741 --> 16:16.710
when you
come right down to it.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.611
Who's Frank?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.279
Her first husband.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.651
Frank is not going
to be there, Gertie.

16:24.685 --> 16:26.653
Oh. Well, then why
are we all so worried?

16:26.687 --> 16:30.691
Claire is going to be in there
with her lawyer,

16:30.724 --> 16:33.293
saying that you and I
shouldn't be married.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.761
Married?

16:37.430 --> 16:40.500
Well,
I suspect Frank

16:40.534 --> 16:43.203
will have something
to say about that.

16:44.805 --> 16:46.272
Frank is dead.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.010
You remember that.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.280
Oh, yes...

16:57.851 --> 16:59.285
just as well.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.404
Who are you?

17:18.438 --> 17:21.174
I represent
Stuart Donovan,

17:21.207 --> 17:23.577
the man who is about to be
executed on your testimony.

17:23.609 --> 17:27.480
Don't be laying that on me.
Other folks testified.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.449
But your testimony
was especially powerful.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.552
You said
that he confessed to you.

17:31.585 --> 17:32.252
He did.

17:32.285 --> 17:35.155
Really?
Why would he do that?

17:35.188 --> 17:37.691
Had an attack of conscience,
I guess.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.561
Seems to happen a lot
around you, doesn't it?

17:40.594 --> 17:45.231
Back in 1988, you were arrested
for robbing a liquor store.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.701
Then you testified
that Stuart Donovan confessed,

17:47.734 --> 17:49.603
and you got
a reduced sentence.

17:49.636 --> 17:53.507
Then arrested again in '91
and '93 on other charges--

17:53.540 --> 17:56.276
both times you became a snitch
on jailhouse confessions

17:56.309 --> 17:59.412
and both times you got
a reduced sentence.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.582
People open up to me.

18:01.615 --> 18:05.786
Stuart Donovan
is about to be executed.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.621
Do you really want that
on your conscience?

18:08.589 --> 18:10.724
You are a burglar
and an armed robber,

18:10.757 --> 18:14.861
but you have never
killed anyone.

18:14.895 --> 18:17.631
Don't start
with Stuart Donovan.

18:21.635 --> 18:22.703
What do you
want from me?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.138
A statement saying
that you lied--

18:25.171 --> 18:27.273
that he never confessed.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.710
The statute of limitations
has run on perjury.

18:29.743 --> 18:31.578
You won't
have to worry about that.

18:40.754 --> 18:41.555
I'll do it...

18:44.457 --> 18:47.227
if you get me
a bring-down to county--

18:47.260 --> 18:48.629
Curran-Frumhold
facility.

18:48.662 --> 18:50.597
I don't know
how I can do that.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.236
Then we got nothing
to talk about.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.806
Earl,
a man is about to die.

18:59.840 --> 19:03.376
No bring-down,
no statement.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.614
(knocks on door)

19:20.861 --> 19:23.363
the question we have,
Mrs. Turner,

19:23.396 --> 19:26.767
is whether you fully appreciated
what you were doing

19:26.800 --> 19:29.269
when you took this man
for your husband.

19:29.302 --> 19:33.473
The question you have
is whether I'm nuts.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.976
I can
fully appreciate that.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.211
I need some straight answers,
ma'am.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.581
Why do I
owe anybody anything?

19:41.648 --> 19:44.250
I didn't
see anybody here

19:44.284 --> 19:47.621
coming to visit me
in that hole.

19:47.654 --> 19:51.224
All you people
care so much--

19:52.025 --> 19:53.627
where were you?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.662
Where were you,
Claire?

19:56.029 --> 19:58.398
Please don't address
your daughter, ma'am.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.602
Arthur is the only one
who wants to take care of me.

20:01.635 --> 20:06.507
He's the only one
who loves me. Frank didn't.

20:06.540 --> 20:07.641
Who is Frank?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.743
He's dead,
that's who he is.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.377
Frank was her first husband.

20:11.912 --> 20:13.847
Bang on the head,
he's dead.

20:15.549 --> 20:19.620
Arthur's idea
to say he fell.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.856
JUDGE: Excuse me?

20:24.024 --> 20:26.492
You wouldn't stop him.

20:27.561 --> 20:28.895
(crying)

20:30.363 --> 20:31.998
the man beat on me.

20:32.032 --> 20:33.734
Gertie!

20:33.767 --> 20:36.603
Bang on the head,
he's dead.

20:36.637 --> 20:37.838
Oh, my god.

20:37.871 --> 20:39.472
Your honor, could we take
a short recess?

20:39.506 --> 20:40.340
No, actually.

20:40.373 --> 20:44.477
Mrs. Turner, Frank--
your first husband--

20:44.511 --> 20:45.546
how did he die?

20:47.948 --> 20:49.015
He fell.

20:49.049 --> 20:50.050
He fell.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.818
A second ago
you were suggesting

20:51.852 --> 20:53.787
that Arthur
hit him on the head.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.689
That's what happened.

20:55.722 --> 20:59.459
He fell after Arthur
hit him on the head.

21:02.393 --> 21:08.248
Arthur is the only one
who loves me.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.739
And he killed
your first husband?

21:13.774 --> 21:16.009
You can't force me...

21:16.042 --> 21:17.844
to testify against him.

21:19.813 --> 21:22.315
He's my husband now.

21:23.684 --> 21:26.653
I don't
have to say a word...

21:26.687 --> 21:27.688
right, honey?

21:41.735 --> 21:43.369
Well,
I hope you're happy.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.270
What?

21:44.304 --> 21:47.874
That double Lujack--
that annulment thing--

21:47.908 --> 21:49.776
turns out sweet Arthur
is a murderer.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.444
Excuse me?

21:51.477 --> 21:53.947
Well, it seems Arthur
whacked her first husband

21:53.980 --> 21:55.949
with a 2x4
and married her,

21:55.982 --> 21:58.552
maybe so, she could avail
herself of spousal privilege

21:58.585 --> 22:01.588
and wouldn't
have to testify.
What?

22:01.622 --> 22:02.656
It doesn't all make sense.

22:02.689 --> 22:06.126
The guy was killed 15 years ago.
Why get married now?

22:06.159 --> 22:08.428
Anyway, the judge
annulled the marriage

22:08.461 --> 22:10.831
and referred the matter
to Helen Gamble.

22:10.864 --> 22:13.667
You're helping me on this Bobby.
You Lujacked me into a murder.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.101
I Lujacked to Lindsay.

22:15.135 --> 22:17.504
Fine.
Then you can both help me.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.777
It was a terrible thing.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.712
Did you see Stuart Donovan
that night?

22:25.746 --> 22:29.482
No. I was in Florida
visiting my folks that month.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.417
A month--
you were away a whole month?

22:31.451 --> 22:35.055
Mr. Young, my husband
was a drunk back then.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.623
There's no mystery here.

22:36.657 --> 22:38.424
The reason we got divorced
is because I got tired

22:38.458 --> 22:41.094
of seeing him passed out
every night at 9:00.

22:41.127 --> 22:44.497
He slept in that chair there
for six straight years.

22:44.531 --> 22:48.669
9:00? He said he saw Stuart
between 11:30 and 12:00.

22:48.702 --> 22:49.703
Yeah, well...

22:50.203 --> 22:51.104
well what?

22:51.137 --> 22:54.007
I wasn't here, Mr. Young.
I was in Florida.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.677
Mrs. Bresler, I'm not
going after your ex-husband.

22:56.710 --> 22:58.612
I got a guy looking at death
in two weeks

22:58.645 --> 23:00.446
for a crime
he didn't commit.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.114
He confessed.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.082
No, he didn't.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.486
Is it possible

23:06.520 --> 23:09.089
your ex-husband was lying
about that 11:30 business?

23:11.457 --> 23:13.026
I don't think
he would lie.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.127
But?

23:15.195 --> 23:17.564
There was a "but"
in your tone.

23:17.598 --> 23:19.566
He could've believed
it was 11:30

23:19.600 --> 23:21.001
when it
may have been 9:00.

23:21.034 --> 23:25.906
By that time, he would've been
12 sheets to the wind.

23:25.939 --> 23:28.441
Why didn't you tell this
to the police?

23:28.474 --> 23:29.810
I did.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.181
LUCY: Get this--
turns out Johnny Carson

23:35.215 --> 23:37.518
had a prime-time special
on that night.

23:37.551 --> 23:39.019
This guy might have thought
it was 11:30

23:39.052 --> 23:41.722
when he saw Johnny Carson on,
but it was really only 9:00.

23:41.755 --> 23:45.692
So, we got a bogus eyewitness
on top of a bogus informant.

23:45.726 --> 23:46.660
So, what happens?

23:46.693 --> 23:48.895
They have to order
a new trial now, don't they?

23:48.929 --> 23:50.597
ELLENOR: No way.

23:50.631 --> 23:51.598
How can they not--

23:51.632 --> 23:54.000
Mary, I haven't solved
the confession thing yet.

23:54.034 --> 23:56.603
He only recants if I get him
transferred to county jail,

23:56.637 --> 23:59.472
and I haven't a clue
as to how to pull that off.

23:59.506 --> 24:02.208
All we have to do
is get him into court.

24:02.242 --> 24:03.109
What do you mean?

24:03.143 --> 24:05.011
The Curran-Frumhold
facility

24:05.045 --> 24:07.881
is used as a lockup
for the common pleas court.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.016
If he could get into court
on anything,

24:10.050 --> 24:11.752
that's where
they'll hold him.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.591
BOBBY: It was referred
to Helen?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.025
And she wants
to talk to them.

24:19.059 --> 24:20.126
Not a chance.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.895
She implied she might file
charges if they don't talk.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.864
Let her.
It was 15 years ago.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.866
She's going to make murder
on the testimony of a witness

24:25.899 --> 24:29.803
with Alzheimer's for
a 15-year-old crime? Good luck.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.071
Well, even so,
if we can spare them

24:31.104 --> 24:33.640
from being put
through a trial...
This can't get prosecuted.

24:33.674 --> 24:34.775
Don't be so sure.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.877
Helen,
thanks for calling first.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.513
You're not
talking to them.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.815
Bobby, we already have
her recorded testimony.

24:41.848 --> 24:44.084
Oh, right, you'll be sure
to get a guilty with that.

24:44.117 --> 24:47.120
Evidently the dead husband
used to abuse her.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.855
And that means
Arthur killed him?

24:48.889 --> 24:50.624
Rebecca,
she said he did.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.092
Because she has
Alzheimer's.

24:52.125 --> 24:55.996
And because it's probably true.
Let me just talk to them.

24:56.029 --> 24:56.730
No way.

24:56.763 --> 24:58.131
Then he'll
probably get charged.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.567
Well, we're not letting you
speak to them.

25:01.668 --> 25:04.638
Please don't make me prosecute
a 76-year-old man.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.973
You're not
talking to them.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.717
He's in
the conference room.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.051
You got to be kidding.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.953
If I can't
ask her questions here,

25:19.986 --> 25:22.022
I will just do it
at a P. C. hearing.

25:22.055 --> 25:24.257
REBECCA: Bobby--

25:24.290 --> 25:25.726
No.

25:26.760 --> 25:27.794
Okay, let's go.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.868
ARTHUR:
What's going on?

25:34.901 --> 25:36.903
Don't say anything, Arthur.
They're arresting you.

25:36.937 --> 25:37.838
We'll take care of it.

25:37.871 --> 25:38.739
Arresting me?

25:38.772 --> 25:40.741
I'm going to go
to the precinct with you.

25:40.774 --> 25:42.743
Lindsay and Bobby--
they'll look after Gertrude.

25:42.776 --> 25:44.244
Where are they taking him?

25:44.277 --> 25:47.581
I'm all right, Gertie.
Don't you worry.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.249
MAN: you have the right
to remain silent.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.151
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

25:51.184 --> 25:51.918
in a court of law.

25:51.952 --> 25:53.319
You have the right
to an attorney.

25:53.353 --> 25:55.288
If you cannot afford one...

25:55.321 --> 25:56.990
(sobbing)

26:01.061 --> 26:02.328
EARL: What do you mean
new lawyer?

26:02.362 --> 26:04.097
A private
defense attorney.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.866
What are you
talking about?

26:05.899 --> 26:08.602
I'm trying to get you to county,
and this is how it works.

26:08.635 --> 26:11.337
Your new private attorney
will go in asking the state

26:11.371 --> 26:12.573
to pay your legal fees.

26:12.606 --> 26:15.041
The court is going to want to
know what's wrong with your P. D.

26:15.075 --> 26:17.778
and to get the answer, they're
going to need to hear from you,

26:17.811 --> 26:21.214
and for that,
you've got to be there.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.850
You'll be transported
to the Curran-Frumhold facility

26:23.884 --> 26:26.352
to be available for your
evidentiary presentation.

26:26.386 --> 26:29.322
Then after the hearing
you'll be brought back here.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.024
This only happens
if you give me the statement.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.025
I will.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.193
Well, I need it now.

26:33.226 --> 26:34.260
Well,
you don't get it now--

26:35.361 --> 26:36.997
not till after
I go to Curran.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.032
This could take some time.
Stuart Donovan--

26:39.065 --> 26:39.900
Well, you know what?

26:39.933 --> 26:41.768
I suggest you speed it up
'cause I ain't

26:41.802 --> 26:43.904
giving you the statement
till after I go to Curran.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.108
JIMMY: That's bad.

26:48.141 --> 26:50.844
The soonest we can get
Earl to Curran is 10 days.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.412
If we wait that long
and we strike out,

26:52.445 --> 26:53.947
that leaves us
with just four days.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.115
We can't risk that.

26:57.684 --> 26:58.785
Let's still go in tomorrow.

26:58.819 --> 26:59.920
With what?

26:59.953 --> 27:02.022
Well, we've got
the ex-wife's affidavit

27:02.055 --> 27:03.123
on the witness's drinking.

27:03.156 --> 27:06.259
We've possible prosecutorial
misconduct there as well.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.029
You can also represent
as an officer of the court

27:09.062 --> 27:11.397
that Taylor is prepared
to recant on the confession.

27:11.431 --> 27:12.298
That's got to be enough

27:12.332 --> 27:14.067
to at least get an order
for a DNA test.

27:14.100 --> 27:17.804
I would like to go in
with more than that.

27:17.838 --> 27:20.774
You feel guaranteed you'll
get that statement from Taylor?

27:20.807 --> 27:22.943
Guaranteed from that guy?
Hardly.

27:22.976 --> 27:25.445
Then we can't waste 10 days
banking on him.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.681
Let's go in tomorrow
with what we've got.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.229
Okay. Let's do it.

27:46.199 --> 27:48.368
I don't know
about a conviction,

27:48.401 --> 27:50.136
but beating
probable cause--

27:50.170 --> 27:51.705
that's a very low
threshold.

27:51.738 --> 27:54.908
She just gets confused
about things.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.477
Well, what was she
confused about?

27:57.511 --> 27:59.813
She said you hit him
on the head.

27:59.846 --> 28:00.814
Did that
come out of nowhere?

28:00.847 --> 28:04.017
Yes. The man fell.

28:05.819 --> 28:07.253
They'll probably call her
to the stand.

28:07.287 --> 28:08.388
No.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.356
This is a criminal proceeding.
I can't--

28:10.390 --> 28:12.225
I don't want her
put in the witness chair again.

28:15.461 --> 28:18.231
We need
to protect her.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.333
Are you looking
to protect her or yourself?

28:20.366 --> 28:23.169
You think I'm a murderer now,
Ms. Washington?

28:23.203 --> 28:25.405
I don't really know you,
Mr. Turner.

28:25.438 --> 28:27.440
You don't strike me
as being anything but gentle,

28:27.473 --> 28:30.010
but as your lawyer,
let me tell you,

28:30.043 --> 28:32.012
they already have
a recorded testimony

28:32.045 --> 28:33.880
from the annulment
proceeding.

28:33.914 --> 28:36.783
They could probably satisfy
probable cause with that.

28:36.817 --> 28:39.185
But they couldn't
convict on it, right?

28:42.188 --> 28:45.425
If you're
to avoid a trial,

28:45.458 --> 28:46.392
the best thing

28:46.426 --> 28:49.095
is for Gertrude to testify
at probable cause

28:49.129 --> 28:51.998
and say you didn't do
what she said you did--

28:52.032 --> 28:53.199
that she was confused.

28:53.233 --> 28:55.836
I don't
want her testifying.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.940
I don't think
you have a choice.

29:16.222 --> 29:19.459
Stuart Donovan versus
the state of Pennsylvania.

29:19.492 --> 29:21.461
We'll hear
from the petitioner

29:28.134 --> 29:28.969
May it please the court.

29:29.002 --> 29:30.303
My name is Eleanor Frutt,

29:30.336 --> 29:31.838
and I am joined
by my colleagues

29:31.872 --> 29:34.107
Eugene Young
and James Berluti.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.909
We are here representing
Stuart Donovan

29:35.942 --> 29:39.145
and his petition to get
a court-ordered DNA test,

29:39.179 --> 29:41.081
which test
would likely exonerate him

29:41.114 --> 29:43.449
of the crime for which
he has been convicted,

29:43.483 --> 29:44.618
which conviction

29:44.651 --> 29:48.388
has him scheduled for death by
lethal injection in 14 days.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.524
In order
for us to prevail,

29:50.557 --> 29:53.426
we must show by clear
and convincing evidence

29:53.459 --> 29:55.161
that it would be
unreasonable for a jury

29:55.195 --> 29:58.064
to have found my client guilty
under the evidence.

29:58.098 --> 30:00.233
Before we get to that,
you must also show that

30:00.266 --> 30:03.169
your client's constitutional
rights were violated.

30:03.203 --> 30:05.205
I believe we can make
that showing, your honor.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.007
One of the key eyewitnesses
in the case

30:07.040 --> 30:09.375
suffered from a very serious
drinking problem.

30:09.409 --> 30:11.044
That's exculpatory evidence

30:11.077 --> 30:13.547
the state failed
to turn over to the defense.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.281
This drinking problem
was relevant?

30:15.315 --> 30:17.618
We believe it was,
your honor, since the events

30:17.651 --> 30:20.486
he claimed to have witnessed
occurred at a time of night

30:20.521 --> 30:22.322
when his capacity
for observation

30:22.355 --> 30:24.858
was routinely undermined
by his inebriated--

30:24.891 --> 30:26.259
he was drunk on the night
in question?

30:26.292 --> 30:29.295
According to his ex-wife,
whose affidavit is attached

30:29.329 --> 30:31.397
to our memorandum
as exhibit "D,"

30:31.431 --> 30:35.268
she said her husband was
habitually drunk every night--

30:35.301 --> 30:38.905
can she verify that he was
intoxicated on this night?

30:38.939 --> 30:41.141
She wasn't there,
but she's basing--
Thank you.

30:41.174 --> 30:43.176
You can verify
that the prosecution

30:43.209 --> 30:44.210
knew of his
drinking problem?

30:44.244 --> 30:47.213
Yes. Mrs. Bresler told
the police that her husband

30:47.247 --> 30:50.250
was typically passed out
by 9:00 every night

30:50.283 --> 30:53.419
and that he was quite possibly
confused as to the time

30:53.453 --> 30:55.956
he said he saw
my client's car pull up.

30:55.989 --> 30:58.424
This was never
brought to the attention

30:58.458 --> 31:00.293
of the defense,
and, accordingly,

31:00.326 --> 31:02.629
Mr. Bresler was never
cross-examined on it.

31:02.663 --> 31:05.566
Wasn't the defense free
to discover all this?

31:05.599 --> 31:08.101
The fact that the defense
was free to discover it

31:08.134 --> 31:10.203
does not absolve
the state's obligation

31:10.236 --> 31:12.305
to turn over
all exculpatory evidence.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.040
Here they didn't.

31:14.074 --> 31:15.275
All right, counsel,

31:15.308 --> 31:17.511
but we also have
a confession in this case.

31:17.544 --> 31:19.613
That confession was
tainted, your honor.

31:19.646 --> 31:21.214
I spoke to Earl Taylor,

31:21.247 --> 31:24.150
the jailhouse informant
who secured that confession,

31:24.184 --> 31:26.920
and he indicated to me that
that statement was false.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.322
He also conveyed his
willingness to recant it,

31:29.355 --> 31:31.157
as you can see
from my affidavit,

31:31.191 --> 31:33.026
exhibit "F."

31:33.059 --> 31:35.428
that means we have
a false confession

31:35.461 --> 31:37.631
backed up
by very questionable

31:37.664 --> 31:39.232
eyewitness testimony,

31:39.265 --> 31:42.035
and these two pieces
of evidence represent

31:42.068 --> 31:44.705
the prosecution's case
in its entirety--

31:44.738 --> 31:47.541
a lie
from a jailhouse snitch

31:47.574 --> 31:50.944
and the observations
of an intoxicated alcoholic.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.078
That's it.

31:52.112 --> 31:54.047
Plus a blood match.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.517
Well, do we?
That's why we're here--

31:56.550 --> 31:59.520
to seek confirmation
of the blood match.

31:59.553 --> 32:02.623
There was no DNA technology
12 years ago,

32:02.656 --> 32:06.292
but we now have the ability
to run a dispositive test,

32:06.326 --> 32:08.294
and that's what
we're asking for.

32:08.328 --> 32:12.065
Stuart Donovan
is scheduled for death.

32:12.098 --> 32:15.068
We're asking for a test
that would take only hours

32:15.101 --> 32:16.737
to see if we are
about to execute

32:16.770 --> 32:18.705
the right man.

32:18.739 --> 32:21.141
We are not petitioning
that you set him free.

32:21.174 --> 32:24.010
We are not asking
for a new trial.

32:24.645 --> 32:27.581
Just one little test.

32:35.722 --> 32:37.223
(horn blows)

32:38.525 --> 32:39.560
You said yesterday

32:39.593 --> 32:41.662
that Arthur had hit
your late husband

32:41.695 --> 32:43.163
over the head.

32:43.196 --> 32:45.065
At least
you implied that.

32:45.098 --> 32:46.533
Is that what happened?

32:46.567 --> 32:49.335
I take
the fifth commandment.

32:50.637 --> 32:52.138
You can't take
a commandment

32:52.172 --> 32:53.173
in here, ma'am.

32:53.206 --> 32:55.175
My client has asserted
her fifth amendment rights.

32:55.208 --> 32:56.677
She's not being charged
with anything.

32:56.710 --> 32:59.345
Doesn't matter. She's allowed
to assert fifth amendment rights

32:59.379 --> 33:01.715
when there's the prospect
of criminal charges.

33:01.748 --> 33:03.183
The commonwealth
has no intention--

33:03.216 --> 33:04.518
She was there at the time
of the accident.

33:04.551 --> 33:05.619
Possible accessory charges.

33:05.652 --> 33:07.087
Your honor,
I'd ask the court

33:07.120 --> 33:08.288
to grant
the witness immunity.

33:08.321 --> 33:09.556
She doesn't want immunity.

33:09.590 --> 33:11.457
Your honor,
this is hard enough.

33:11.491 --> 33:15.061
I agree.
Counsels, take your seats.

33:16.196 --> 33:18.565
Mrs. Turner,
I'm granting you

33:18.599 --> 33:21.034
full immunity
against prosecution,

33:21.067 --> 33:22.302
which means
you won't be arrested

33:22.335 --> 33:23.369
for anything you say here.

33:24.304 --> 33:26.472
I want you to answer
Ms. Gamble's questions.

33:26.507 --> 33:27.473
Don't do it, Gertie.

33:27.508 --> 33:28.709
Mr. Turner--

33:28.742 --> 33:33.346
He's my husband.
I don't have to testify.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.415
No, your marriage
was annulled.

33:42.255 --> 33:43.089
All right.

33:44.024 --> 33:46.627
Counsel and the witness
in chambers, please.

33:46.660 --> 33:49.062
Mrs. Stevens, you too.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.467
Whether or not a witness
had a drinking problem

33:54.500 --> 33:55.669
is a collateral issue,

33:55.702 --> 33:56.570
certainly not one
which would call for--

33:56.603 --> 33:59.072
Why didn't you tell
the defense about it?

33:59.105 --> 34:02.776
I'm not sure we didn't,
but assuming we didn't,

34:02.809 --> 34:04.444
that goes
to impeachment only.

34:04.477 --> 34:05.646
It wasn't evidence.

34:05.679 --> 34:08.715
Moreover, knowing
of Mr. Bresler's problem,

34:08.748 --> 34:12.085
a reasonable jury still could
have chosen to believe him.

34:12.118 --> 34:13.620
What about
the confession?

34:13.654 --> 34:16.289
The state stands
by the confession.

34:16.322 --> 34:19.592
Defense is now trying to bribe
the informant into recanting

34:19.626 --> 34:20.460
the statement he gave--

34:20.493 --> 34:21.360
I object to that.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.597
May it
please the court,

34:23.630 --> 34:26.600
Mr. Taylor contacted
our office and informed us

34:26.632 --> 34:28.702
of Ms. Frutt's attempts.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.670
We outfitted him
with a wire.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.639
She promised to try
to get him transferred

34:33.674 --> 34:35.676
to a county facility
in exchange

34:35.708 --> 34:37.643
for him recanting
the statement concerning

34:37.678 --> 34:41.581
Mr. Donovan's confession.
If you please...

34:41.614 --> 34:43.349
ELLENOR'S VOICE:
and this is how it works--

34:43.382 --> 34:45.652
your new private attorney
will go in asking the state

34:45.686 --> 34:47.187
to pay your legal fees.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.254
The court's going to
want to know

34:48.288 --> 34:50.322
what's wrong with your P. D.,
<i>and to get the answer,</i>

34:50.356 --> 34:52.125
they're going to need
to hear from you,

34:52.158 --> 34:54.628
and for that,
you've got to be there.

34:54.661 --> 34:57.297
You'll be transported
to the Curran-Frumhold facility

34:57.330 --> 34:59.766
to be available for
your evidentiary presentation,

34:59.800 --> 35:02.603
and then after the hearing,
you'll be brought back here.

35:02.636 --> 35:04.337
May I respond to that,
your honor?

35:04.370 --> 35:06.206
I would hope
you would.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.215
Yes, I offered
to help the informant

35:15.248 --> 35:18.318
in exchange for him
telling the truth.

35:18.351 --> 35:19.786
Just as the prosecution

35:19.820 --> 35:21.387
was free to play ball
with him,

35:21.421 --> 35:23.223
offering him
a reduced prison term

35:23.256 --> 35:24.390
in exchange
for his testimony,

35:24.424 --> 35:27.293
so, too, am I free
to make a deal.

35:27.327 --> 35:28.895
I was not
suborning perjury.

35:28.929 --> 35:30.496
Are you suggesting
I was?

35:30.531 --> 35:33.333
All I am suggesting is that
Mr. Taylor is a liar.

35:33.366 --> 35:35.569
And better that
he lie for you?

35:35.602 --> 35:38.304
This informant is
a professional witness.

35:38.338 --> 35:40.273
He has gotten three
of his own sentences

35:40.306 --> 35:42.609
cut down by getting
three different confessions.

35:42.643 --> 35:43.510
Who's kidding who here?

35:43.544 --> 35:44.611
All right.

35:47.981 --> 35:49.850
I would remind the court

35:49.883 --> 35:52.185
we are not asking you
to stay an execution.

35:52.218 --> 35:55.522
We are not asking
for a mistrial or a new trial.

35:55.556 --> 35:58.291
We are not begging you
to commute a sentence

35:58.324 --> 36:01.695
or to show leniency,
just a test,

36:01.728 --> 36:04.731
one that will
tell us the truth.

36:04.765 --> 36:07.601
And given
the incredibly sketchy evidence

36:07.634 --> 36:10.236
that's the basis
of his conviction,

36:10.270 --> 36:12.773
how can any system
that purports to offer

36:12.806 --> 36:15.942
even an appearance
of being about the truth

36:15.976 --> 36:17.377
not say yes?

36:18.011 --> 36:22.683
The state lost the rape kit.
They lost it.

36:22.716 --> 36:24.651
They didn't even bother
to look for it.

36:24.685 --> 36:27.921
We hunted for it,
we dug it out, we found it,

36:27.954 --> 36:31.224
and now all we're asking
is that you test it.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.693
That isn't much.

36:32.726 --> 36:36.797
It's certainly a lot less work
than executing a man.

36:46.873 --> 36:48.675
I know you love Arthur,

36:49.442 --> 36:50.977
but, ma'am,
I'm sure you loved

36:51.011 --> 36:52.846
your late husband
Frank, too, didn't you?

36:52.879 --> 36:54.648
Oh, god, no.

36:56.282 --> 36:57.851
He hit me, Frank did.

36:57.884 --> 37:00.954
I was glad he died,
truth be told.

37:00.987 --> 37:03.389
Okay.

37:03.423 --> 37:05.225
Did Arthur kill him?

37:06.527 --> 37:08.695
Can you take us
back to that day?

37:12.332 --> 37:14.568
I don't want
to go back to that day.

37:14.601 --> 37:16.469
We need you to.

37:21.074 --> 37:25.612
Frank was at me,
like every day,

37:26.847 --> 37:28.381
yelling this and that.

37:30.383 --> 37:31.718
I told him before,

37:33.419 --> 37:36.757
"you take your hand
to me again..."

37:37.423 --> 37:39.760
And he did,

37:39.793 --> 37:44.397
right across my face,
like so many times before.

37:46.332 --> 37:47.467
And I...

37:49.836 --> 37:51.538
saw it there.

37:51.572 --> 37:53.406
(suspenseful music)

37:53.439 --> 37:55.375
You saw what?

37:55.408 --> 37:56.409
The board,

37:58.444 --> 38:00.881
laying on the counter.

38:01.682 --> 38:04.484
I just picked it up.

38:05.385 --> 38:06.653
You picked it up?

38:07.420 --> 38:08.689
Yes, I did.

38:09.856 --> 38:11.558
I told him,

38:12.358 --> 38:15.762
"you take
your hand to me..."

38:20.534 --> 38:24.437
I-I didn't mean
to kill him,

38:24.470 --> 38:26.640
just swat him down.

38:27.741 --> 38:29.610
You hit your husband?

38:31.044 --> 38:35.782
Arthur came in and said
we should say he fell.

38:37.150 --> 38:38.351
Mom.

38:43.657 --> 38:47.060
I'm sorry, Claire.

38:48.995 --> 38:50.664
I killed your daddy.

38:57.871 --> 38:59.840
Why did you say
Arthur did it?

39:01.174 --> 39:07.057
Sometimes I think he did.

39:07.413 --> 39:11.818
I-I get confused.

39:16.156 --> 39:17.658
I think...

39:20.160 --> 39:23.764
"how could I have..."

39:26.967 --> 39:31.404
(crying)

39:35.008 --> 39:36.643
but I did.

39:46.052 --> 39:47.453
I did.

40:12.078 --> 40:13.747
She says she killed him.

40:17.984 --> 40:19.085
Did she?

40:29.663 --> 40:30.597
I don't understand.

40:35.268 --> 40:37.504
She started
talking about it.

40:40.941 --> 40:42.643
I had to get her
out of that home

40:42.676 --> 40:45.979
before she got herself
into trouble.

40:47.247 --> 40:48.148
Th--

40:48.181 --> 40:49.550
that's why you married her,

40:49.583 --> 40:51.752
to get her out
before she said too much?

40:54.521 --> 40:55.856
That, and I love her.

40:59.660 --> 41:01.127
What are they
going to do to her?

41:02.195 --> 41:03.463
Nothing.

41:04.197 --> 41:05.966
She's got immunity,
remember?

41:07.033 --> 41:08.769
So, what happens?

41:08.802 --> 41:10.003
Well, you're free to go.

41:10.036 --> 41:11.672
You can take her home
if you want.

41:16.810 --> 41:18.178
Where is she?

41:18.211 --> 41:20.781
(indistinct chatter)

41:22.248 --> 41:23.984
Gertie.

41:31.257 --> 41:34.027
They got me to tell.

41:34.127 --> 41:36.129
That's okay
sweetheart.

41:36.162 --> 41:40.500
But, you didn't
want me to tell.

41:40.634 --> 41:41.535
It's okay.

41:41.568 --> 41:45.305
I'm going to take you home,
sweetheart.

41:45.338 --> 41:47.173
You're not mad at me?

41:47.774 --> 41:49.175
Hey, I love you.

41:54.848 --> 41:55.949
(kisses)

41:58.985 --> 42:00.286
Come on,
let's go home.

42:12.799 --> 42:13.900
CLERK: Be seated.

42:17.137 --> 42:18.805
It is the opinion of this court

42:18.839 --> 42:21.241
that Stuart Donovan's
constitutional rights

42:21.274 --> 42:24.778
were violated by
the district attorney's failure

42:24.811 --> 42:27.080
to provide defense counsel
with the information

42:27.113 --> 42:29.983
concerning Mr. Bresler's
drinking problems.

42:30.383 --> 42:33.687
Certainly,
armed with this information,

42:33.720 --> 42:35.221
a jury might have been
more inclined

42:35.255 --> 42:37.758
to disbelieve
this material witness.

42:39.025 --> 42:41.895
As for
the informant's statement

42:41.928 --> 42:44.698
concerning Mr. Donovan's
confession,

42:44.731 --> 42:47.801
that, too,
is certainly in doubt.

42:49.035 --> 42:50.771
The standard
for this court, however,

42:50.804 --> 42:53.006
is whether
a reasonable jury

42:53.039 --> 42:56.877
could have found
the defendant guilty.

42:56.910 --> 42:58.845
While we feel the jury
in this case,

42:58.879 --> 43:02.082
given all
this new information,

43:02.115 --> 43:03.817
quite likely
would have returned

43:03.850 --> 43:06.119
with a verdict
of not guilty,

43:06.152 --> 43:08.755
we are not persuaded that
they could not have

43:08.789 --> 43:14.761
reasonably returned
with a guilty just the same.

43:14.795 --> 43:17.130
The petitioner's request
for a DNA test

43:17.163 --> 43:18.765
is therefore denied.

43:18.799 --> 43:20.166
We are adjourned.

43:21.201 --> 43:22.669
(bangs gavel)

43:27.407 --> 43:28.709
Let's go!

43:29.309 --> 43:32.846
(crying)

44:11.985 --> 44:14.988
(music playing)

44:38.244 --> 44:39.312
You stinker!
