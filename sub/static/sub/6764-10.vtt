02:36.069 --> 02:37.263
When you look at me like that,

02:37.437 --> 02:40.304
l don't know how l managed
all these years without you next to me.

02:41.308 --> 02:43.572
Well, you weren't exactly
lacking for company.

02:44.945 --> 02:46.572
No, this is different.

02:47.347 --> 02:49.076
Yeah, for me too.

02:51.017 --> 02:53.611
l can't wait to start spending
the rest of my life with you.

02:55.455 --> 02:59.050
We're gonna have a real marriage.
No holding back, no play-acting.

03:00.827 --> 03:03.762
You can tell me anything
and l'll always love you.

03:04.231 --> 03:06.222
Nothing will ever come between us.

03:08.168 --> 03:10.762
Well, l have to be
the luckiest man alive.

03:10.937 --> 03:14.304
You're beautiful,
intelligent, sensitive,

03:15.041 --> 03:17.100
and you're all mine.

03:21.014 --> 03:22.743
She's irrational. She's stubborn.

03:22.916 --> 03:25.441
She won't listen to reason.
She's out of control. Out of control.

03:25.619 --> 03:28.611
- Jim, just calm down.
- She's always been headstrong,

03:28.788 --> 03:31.780
but now he's put her up in that hotel
like they're starring in Pretty Woman.

03:31.958 --> 03:35.416
He's not putting her up at that hotel.
They live there.

03:35.595 --> 03:38.223
How could she accept a ring from
a guy she's known for three weeks?

03:38.398 --> 03:40.730
Maybe if we're lucky,
it'll be a long engagement

03:40.901 --> 03:42.596
and they'll both
come to their senses.

03:42.769 --> 03:45.260
Maybe if we're lucky, one of them
will get hit by a cement mixer

03:45.438 --> 03:47.338
- and they'll be laid up for three years.
- Jim.

03:47.507 --> 03:50.374
Guys, if l could interject
for one minute here.

03:50.544 --> 03:54.002
l can't help thinking
this all has a very familiar ring to it.

03:54.180 --> 03:55.204
You mean like with Dylan?

03:55.382 --> 03:57.213
No, no, no,
with Dylan they were playing house.

03:57.384 --> 03:59.545
We knew they'd be
at each other's throats in three days.

03:59.719 --> 04:01.778
And they never talked
about getting married.

04:01.955 --> 04:03.582
Hello.

04:04.457 --> 04:07.017
Yeah, just one second,
l'll get him for you.

04:07.193 --> 04:11.095
Dad, it's Rene from
Lawrence Carson's office, for you.

04:14.367 --> 04:16.062
Jim Walsh.

04:18.772 --> 04:21.570
What? Today?

04:22.776 --> 04:26.940
Yeah, l think l can
rearrange my schedule.

04:27.113 --> 04:28.842
One o'clock.

04:29.549 --> 04:31.881
Yeah, that'll be fine. Okay, thanks.

04:36.323 --> 04:38.120
Wha-- Jim, what is it?

04:39.559 --> 04:41.390
The Carsons want to meet with us.

04:41.561 --> 04:43.495
They've invited themselves
over for lunch.

04:43.930 --> 04:45.830
Does that mean
we R.S.V.P. to them?

04:47.100 --> 04:49.125
l think l just did.

04:49.302 --> 04:52.430
Larry Carson's not the world's
most spontaneous human being.

04:52.606 --> 04:55.074
His schedule's usually booked
for weeks in advance.

04:55.241 --> 04:58.733
They're obviously just as upset
about this thing as we are.

04:59.379 --> 05:01.745
Yeah. Maybe between
the four of us,

05:01.915 --> 05:05.248
we'll be able to restore
some vague semblance of reality here.

05:06.019 --> 05:08.453
Everything is gonna work out.

05:12.926 --> 05:14.723
Donna, come on.
We're gonna be late.

05:14.894 --> 05:16.987
lf Kelly were here,
l could borrow her black clogs.

05:17.497 --> 05:19.328
Yeah, well, thank God she's not.

05:19.499 --> 05:22.366
l liked it better
when you used to be late.

05:23.436 --> 05:25.529
Wait, let me just grab a granola bar
from the kitchen.

05:25.705 --> 05:27.400
Donna, you can get something
on campus.

05:27.574 --> 05:30.099
David, l'm starving.

05:32.012 --> 05:34.173
- Hi, Donna.
- You're back.

05:34.347 --> 05:37.612
Yeah, l came to pick up a few things.
l'll make it quick.

05:37.784 --> 05:39.217
The quicker, the better.

05:39.386 --> 05:42.116
You guys are being ridiculous.
There's nothing to be angry about.

05:42.288 --> 05:44.654
This is all about the lawyers
and that damn deposition.

05:44.824 --> 05:46.416
Donna, just cool it, all right?

05:46.593 --> 05:49.653
No, l won't cool it.
You guys are my best friends.

05:49.829 --> 05:51.421
With friends like that,
who needs enemies?

05:52.332 --> 05:53.890
You know, Kelly,
you're the psych major.

05:54.067 --> 05:56.797
Why don't you tell me
why your mother is doing this to him?

05:56.970 --> 06:00.167
Listen, David,
your dad has always been nice to me,

06:00.340 --> 06:01.773
but l don't wanna see Erin get hurt.

06:01.941 --> 06:04.808
She's only 2 years old. You really
think it's gonna make a difference?

06:04.978 --> 06:06.912
Not now,
but this is about the rest of her life.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.878
No, Kelly, this is about your mother
being lonely and miserable,

06:10.050 --> 06:11.415
and taking it out on my father.

06:14.387 --> 06:17.652
Come on, Donna, let's get out of here.
We're already late for class.

06:20.126 --> 06:23.095
l'll call you later, okay?

06:36.910 --> 06:39.902
- l'll get it.
- Cool, don't keep me waiting.

06:41.815 --> 06:43.840
Yo, KEG house.

06:44.017 --> 06:45.985
Steve Sanders? Let me check.

06:46.152 --> 06:48.416
Who should l say is calling, please?

06:48.588 --> 06:50.283
Laura?

06:53.560 --> 06:56.256
You just missed him.
He just left for class.

06:56.429 --> 06:59.592
Yeah, sure, l'll tell him. Okay.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.191
What did you do to that girl, man?
She's writhing on the floor.

07:03.369 --> 07:04.597
She's begging for it.

07:04.771 --> 07:08.229
Look, don't make a big deal out of it.
She's a nice girl. lt just didn't work out.

07:08.408 --> 07:11.900
Whatever you say.
Third time she's called.

07:19.552 --> 07:20.610
So now Jim and Cindy think

07:20.787 --> 07:23.153
that they're all gonna form
a united front to stop her.

07:23.323 --> 07:24.790
Bro, your sister's a piece of work--

07:24.958 --> 07:27.483
You know what bothers me the most
about this? She's gonna wind up

07:27.660 --> 07:30.458
- with another trip to Paris out of this.
- Yeah, a few more boyfriends,

07:30.630 --> 07:33.098
she'll have enough frequent-flyer
miles, she can go for free.

07:33.266 --> 07:35.359
Man, she's gonna wrap Stuart
around her little finger

07:35.535 --> 07:37.002
just like she does everybody else.

07:37.170 --> 07:39.968
l think this time it's gonna be more like
an albatross around a neck.

07:40.140 --> 07:42.131
You keep dropping
all these hints about Stuart, man.

07:42.308 --> 07:43.707
What's the deal with him anyway?

07:43.877 --> 07:45.970
- No comment.
- What does that mean?

07:46.146 --> 07:48.706
l already tried to get in the middle
of your sister's love life.

07:48.882 --> 07:51.282
l did more harm than good.
So from now on, she's on her own.

07:51.451 --> 07:55.217
- Even if she's gonna marry the guy?
- Hey, they're just engaged.

08:00.727 --> 08:03.389
- Andrea. Hi.
- Hi, Laura.

08:03.563 --> 08:05.758
Oh, after that chemistry experiment
we had,

08:05.932 --> 08:08.560
l'll never have
another french fry again.

08:09.569 --> 08:12.060
l guess it'll take more than that
for me.

08:12.238 --> 08:14.103
You went to West Beverly,
didn't you?

08:15.008 --> 08:16.134
Don't hold it against me.

08:16.309 --> 08:18.209
Why would l hold it against you?

08:18.378 --> 08:19.470
l'm just kidding.

08:19.646 --> 08:21.705
Some people have ideas.

08:21.881 --> 08:24.816
Well, when you were in high school,
did you know a Steve Sanders?

08:24.984 --> 08:26.849
Yeah, very well.
He's one of my closest friends.

08:27.253 --> 08:29.312
Yeah, he seems
like a really nice guy.

08:29.789 --> 08:32.758
We have a folklore and mythology
class together.

08:32.926 --> 08:35.394
You wouldn't know how
l can get in touch with him, would you?

08:36.361 --> 08:39.195
l don't know. Well, he spends
a lot of time at the KEG house.

08:39.799 --> 08:43.758
Yeah, see, l tried there, but
l don't think he's getting my messages.

08:44.236 --> 08:46.102
The thing is,
is that l missed one of my classes

08:46.272 --> 08:49.139
and l thought
maybe l could borrow his notes.

08:49.309 --> 08:50.708
l don't know how good they'll be.

08:51.244 --> 08:54.475
Yeah, well,
l'd still like to talk to him anyway.

08:54.647 --> 08:56.171
Could you give me
his home phone number?

08:56.349 --> 08:58.840
Sure. l think l have it right here.

08:59.018 --> 09:01.919
- lt's okay, l have a piece of paper.
- Okay.

09:02.088 --> 09:04.352
You know, that's one thing
l really love about college,

09:04.524 --> 09:06.924
all kinds of people coming together
from all sorts of places,

09:07.093 --> 09:09.061
even people
that you would least expect.

09:10.763 --> 09:13.391
He doesn't do his reading.
He doesn't do his assignments.

09:13.566 --> 09:16.660
All he wants to do is watch TV
and play basketball.

09:16.836 --> 09:18.098
So l'm thinking maybe he needs

09:18.271 --> 09:20.569
someone who speaks his language,
someone who knows

09:20.740 --> 09:23.265
how to get through to him,
because l obviously don't.

09:23.443 --> 09:24.967
Let me tell you
something about D'Shawn.

09:25.144 --> 09:27.578
The dropout rate in his high school
was 42 percent.

09:27.747 --> 09:30.011
He's the first person in his family
ever to go to college.

09:30.183 --> 09:32.481
He's only the second in his family
to graduate high school.

09:32.652 --> 09:35.382
- He's a smart kid.
- l know. That's what's so frustrating.

09:35.555 --> 09:37.147
l mean,
with midterms coming up next week,

09:37.323 --> 09:40.019
l don't think he's gonna be eligible
to play on the team this season.

09:40.426 --> 09:42.326
What do you think about
asking D'Shawn to join us

09:42.495 --> 09:44.520
when Lucinda and l
have you over for dinner?

09:45.932 --> 09:47.627
l didn't know we had definite plans.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.961
Well, l think if you meet
in a more relaxed atmosphere,

09:50.136 --> 09:53.367
away from the pressures and the roles
you normally have to play--

09:55.341 --> 09:58.071
- Am l interrupting something?
- Oh, no, no, come on in, sweetie.

09:58.244 --> 10:00.804
- You remember Brandon.
- Sure.

10:00.980 --> 10:03.107
- Nice to see you again, Brandon.
- Yeah, you too.

10:03.283 --> 10:06.343
l was just talking to him about
he and D'Shawn coming for dinner.

10:06.519 --> 10:08.316
You like spicy food?

10:08.488 --> 10:09.580
Yeah. l guess.

10:09.756 --> 10:11.053
Well, great. Then you're in luck.

10:11.224 --> 10:14.421
She's got all these native recipes from
Guatemala that are out of this world.

10:14.594 --> 10:15.686
Yeah, it will be fun.

10:15.862 --> 10:17.727
l love getting to know
my husband's students.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.224
Thank you.

10:22.402 --> 10:25.667
Chardonnay.
And an extra-dry martini.

10:25.838 --> 10:27.430
Thank you.

10:30.310 --> 10:31.868
Jim, this is perfect.

10:32.045 --> 10:34.036
Glad you like it.

10:34.213 --> 10:37.580
And we're very glad
that we could all get together

10:37.750 --> 10:40.651
and discuss
our children's engagement.

10:41.654 --> 10:43.952
l'm sure you have
as many concerns about it as we do.

10:44.123 --> 10:46.148
Well, it certainly
caught us by surprise.

10:46.759 --> 10:50.627
Especially since they've only known
each other for a couple of months.

10:51.297 --> 10:53.390
- Three weeks.
- Hi.

10:53.566 --> 10:55.363
Well, here's the happy couple now.

10:55.535 --> 10:58.561
Brenda, you look wonderful.

10:58.738 --> 11:00.729
- Hi.
- ls this a new suit?

11:00.907 --> 11:02.568
Stuart bought it.
Your son is spoiling me.

11:02.742 --> 11:05.802
- Oh, well, he takes after his father.
- Thank you.

11:06.279 --> 11:08.304
Jim. Cindy.

11:08.481 --> 11:11.416
Or would it be okay
if l just called you Mom and Dad?

11:14.487 --> 11:16.512
l thought it was gonna be
just the four of us.

11:16.689 --> 11:18.156
Well, it is their wedding.

11:18.324 --> 11:20.315
They ought to have some say in it,
don't you think?

11:20.927 --> 11:22.986
Now that we're all here,
let's get down to business.

11:23.463 --> 11:25.795
- Shall we sit?
- Good idea.

11:27.934 --> 11:33.372
Jim, as you well know, l've never
been one to beat around the bush.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.340
Now, l know you've done
very well for yourself.

11:36.509 --> 11:38.602
You've got
a nice little practice going.

11:38.778 --> 11:42.111
But l wanna tell you, nothing would
give me more pleasure

11:42.281 --> 11:45.182
than if you would let me
pay for the wedding.

11:45.351 --> 11:48.013
- Father has so much tact.
- Well--

11:48.187 --> 11:50.553
Poor Larry doesn't know
what he's getting himself into.

11:50.723 --> 11:53.089
l've been talking
to the wedding coordinators.

11:53.259 --> 11:56.194
By the time we're finished with this,
my poor husband

11:56.362 --> 11:59.661
is gonna have to build a whole new city
just to pay for it all.

12:00.700 --> 12:04.101
Well, l mean, what exactly
are we really talking about here?

12:04.270 --> 12:07.398
Well, naturally,
we have a lot of obligations.

12:07.573 --> 12:12.909
l mean, from our side alone, we're
looking at between 350, 400 people.

12:13.479 --> 12:15.276
Just a few of their closest friends.

12:15.448 --> 12:18.246
So how many guests
would you like to invite?

12:18.951 --> 12:22.182
Well, l really haven't
the slightest idea.

12:22.989 --> 12:26.356
Oh, dear.
l hope l haven't offended anyone.

12:26.826 --> 12:31.786
Cindy, Jim, we want you to be involved
in absolutely every decision.

12:35.301 --> 12:42.230
Cindy and l kind of hoped
that the children could wait a while.

12:42.408 --> 12:43.432
Dad.

12:43.609 --> 12:45.702
No, no, no,
we couldn't agree with you more.

12:46.546 --> 12:50.107
We were thinking
a June wedding would be perfect.

12:51.017 --> 12:53.952
That is, if it doesn't bother
Stewie's allergies.

12:55.421 --> 12:56.911
Mother.

12:57.323 --> 13:01.453
Listen, l've gotta say
one thing about my son.

13:01.627 --> 13:05.256
He may be irresponsible,
he may be immature,

13:05.431 --> 13:08.628
he may be spoiled rotten.

13:08.801 --> 13:09.961
But for once in his life,

13:10.136 --> 13:12.661
he made a snap decision
that is right on the money.

13:12.839 --> 13:14.466
Don't you think?

13:14.640 --> 13:15.766
- Well--
- Good.

13:15.942 --> 13:17.000
Then it's all settled.

13:17.176 --> 13:18.939
The ladies will spend
the next six months

13:19.112 --> 13:21.546
arguing over their color schemes,

13:21.714 --> 13:24.774
while we try to figure out
how to come up with the cash.

13:24.951 --> 13:29.285
Oh, Larry. lsn't he awful?

13:30.389 --> 13:32.755
He's terrible.

13:36.162 --> 13:37.356
Listen, l'm sorry.

13:37.530 --> 13:40.021
Figures they'd try to turn our wedding
into a three-ring circus.

13:40.199 --> 13:42.724
And my parents are so negative
about us, it's ruining everything.

13:42.902 --> 13:44.961
- There is a way around it, you know.
- What?

13:45.138 --> 13:47.629
We hop on a plane to Las Vegas
tonight and we do it ourselves.

13:47.807 --> 13:48.831
Tonight?

13:49.008 --> 13:51.943
We know we're gonna get married,
so why postpone the inevitable?

13:52.111 --> 13:53.578
l can't think of a single reason why.

13:53.746 --> 13:55.873
We'll grab our things
and we won't tell a soul.

13:56.048 --> 13:58.573
There is one person
that l have to tell.

13:58.751 --> 14:00.480
Are you crazy?

14:00.653 --> 14:02.314
Mom and Dad are gonna kill you.

14:02.488 --> 14:05.946
After tonight, l'll be out of their control.
There's nothing they can do about it.

14:06.125 --> 14:07.717
Brenda, this all seems
a little impetuous.

14:07.894 --> 14:10.385
l mean, have you given this
any thought at all?

14:10.563 --> 14:13.123
l've been doing nothing
but thinking about it for weeks.

14:13.299 --> 14:15.995
But not like this. l mean,
the two of you are acting like fugitives.

14:16.169 --> 14:19.536
Why do l have to keep on
explaining myself to everyone?

14:19.705 --> 14:23.766
Look, Brandon,
l was really hoping for your blessing.

14:23.943 --> 14:25.774
l mean,
you're the only one l can turn to.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.574
Then l guess you have my blessing.

14:33.619 --> 14:34.643
Thank you.

14:34.820 --> 14:37.983
Do you realize the next time
you see me, l'll be Mrs. Stuart Carson?

14:39.625 --> 14:41.092
Oh, one more thing,

14:41.260 --> 14:44.661
whatever you do, don't tell
Mom and Dad, okay, promise?

15:00.613 --> 15:03.411
Still hanging out at the Peach Pit,
huh, McKay?

15:03.583 --> 15:05.642
That's what it looks like.

15:05.952 --> 15:09.319
The old high-school hangout.
Hard to break old habits, huh?

15:09.488 --> 15:11.353
No. l just like the food.

15:11.524 --> 15:14.220
l guess you're one of those guys
that can't handle change too well.

15:14.393 --> 15:17.590
Maybe l just don't try to fix something
that isn't broken.

15:17.763 --> 15:20.425
Or maybe you just can't face
what's already breaking up.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.227
Oh, you're so subtle, John.

15:23.269 --> 15:26.568
You know, Kelly tells me
she doesn't wanna see you anymore.

15:26.739 --> 15:29.674
But every time l turn around,
she's still with you.

15:30.042 --> 15:32.374
So l figure you must have
some kind of hold on her.

15:32.545 --> 15:35.844
No, Kelly can see whoever she wants.
She knows that.

15:36.015 --> 15:37.642
But why she'd wanna see you,

15:37.817 --> 15:40.342
that's just beyond me.

15:44.423 --> 15:46.186
That's right, McKay.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.559
lt is beyond you.

15:53.599 --> 15:55.294
l don't like that kid.

15:55.468 --> 15:56.730
Even when he was in high school,

15:56.902 --> 15:59.462
l always knew there'd be trouble
whenever he showed up.

15:59.639 --> 16:01.038
Yeah.

16:01.207 --> 16:04.005
Let me ask you something, Nat.
l've been with a lot of girls.

16:04.176 --> 16:08.613
Why is it the only two l ever loved
are running around with total dirtbags?

16:15.388 --> 16:17.549
The nerve of those people,

16:17.723 --> 16:21.056
barging in here, railroading their
over-inflated plans down our throats,

16:21.227 --> 16:23.855
and then saying they want us involved
in every decision.

16:24.030 --> 16:26.692
l didn't know what l was supposed
to do. Carson's my biggest client.

16:26.866 --> 16:28.857
l couldn't tell him
we don't want him in our family.

16:29.035 --> 16:32.471
Will you tell me one thing? Why are
they so eager to marry off their son?

16:32.638 --> 16:33.662
You know what l think?

16:33.839 --> 16:37.570
l think this is just an excuse
for Vivian to throw another party.

16:38.711 --> 16:40.508
So how'd it go?

16:41.847 --> 16:43.212
Not exactly as we'd hoped.

16:43.382 --> 16:45.976
The Carsons have decided to throw
them the wedding of the century.

16:46.152 --> 16:49.144
- And you guys are okay with that?
- We didn't have a whole lot of choice.

16:49.722 --> 16:51.952
Listen, Jim,
maybe it's not as bad as we think.

16:52.124 --> 16:55.150
l mean, they are talking about
six-months' preparation.

16:55.328 --> 16:56.795
A lot can change in six months.

16:56.962 --> 16:58.953
Listen, l'm not ready to give up yet.

16:59.131 --> 17:01.759
l still think if we get Brenda alone
and sit her down,

17:01.934 --> 17:03.162
we can reason with her.

17:12.712 --> 17:14.179
Yeah, what's up,
what's up, what's up?

17:14.347 --> 17:16.611
Steve, it's Brandon.
Pack your bags, we're going to Vegas.

17:17.148 --> 17:18.513
Dig it, a road trip.

17:18.684 --> 17:20.845
All right man, Vegas.
Do you need an lD, because--?

17:21.020 --> 17:22.782
Steve, we're not going there
to gamble.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.148
Then why are we going?

17:25.590 --> 17:26.887
Brenda's eloping.

17:29.995 --> 17:33.089
- What did you say?
- You heard me,

17:33.265 --> 17:34.391
With Stuart?

17:34.567 --> 17:37.195
No, with Pope John Paul ll.
Of course with Stuart.

17:37.370 --> 17:39.770
Hey, man, what's with your sister?
What, is she flipping out?

17:39.939 --> 17:42.737
l don't know. l'm gonna get us tickets
for the 5:00 flight from Burbank.

17:42.908 --> 17:45.069
Burbank? Why do we have to drive
all the way to Burbank?

17:45.244 --> 17:48.407
Because everything from LAX
is booked. Let's just do this, okay?

17:48.581 --> 17:50.572
Listen, any probIems,
I'm gonna caII you right back,

17:50.750 --> 17:52.047
Okay.

17:55.421 --> 17:56.445
So, what's the problem?

17:56.856 --> 17:59.051
Gee, Steve,
where would you like me to start?

17:59.225 --> 18:02.023
- Who is this?
- lt's Laura.

18:02.828 --> 18:04.523
Laura.

18:04.697 --> 18:06.927
Look, l've been meaning to call you.
l'm sorry l haven't.

18:07.099 --> 18:10.933
But l'm on my way to Vegas right now.
l'll speak to you when l get back, okay?

18:23.883 --> 18:24.907
HeIIo?

18:25.084 --> 18:27.848
Kel, you're not gonna believe this.

18:28.621 --> 18:29.645
She what?

18:30.189 --> 18:31.213
She is?

18:31.557 --> 18:32.581
When?

18:33.025 --> 18:34.049
Okay.

18:34.326 --> 18:35.850
Bye.

18:37.863 --> 18:39.057
You're not gonna believe this,

18:39.231 --> 18:41.529
but Brenda's on her way to Las Vegas
to get married.

19:00.052 --> 19:02.577
l'm going out.

19:02.755 --> 19:04.188
Okay. Where are you going?

19:05.224 --> 19:06.248
Las Vegas.

19:06.425 --> 19:07.824
Las Vegas?

19:07.993 --> 19:09.290
l thought you'd stopped gambling.

19:09.795 --> 19:11.558
l have stopped gambling, Dad.

19:11.730 --> 19:14.494
Well, then why in the world
are you going to Las Vegas?

19:15.901 --> 19:18.028
l promised Brenda l wouldn't tell you.

19:18.938 --> 19:22.203
- What now?
- Brandon.

19:26.178 --> 19:28.078
She and Stuart
are getting married there tonight.

19:28.247 --> 19:29.737
l have taken
just about enough of this.

19:29.915 --> 19:31.746
- Oh, my God!
- We're going.

19:31.917 --> 19:33.441
No, Dad, you can't go.

19:33.619 --> 19:36.747
lf you show up there,
she'll never trust me again.

19:37.022 --> 19:38.455
We won't tell her you said anything.

19:38.624 --> 19:41.889
And what, you just wound up
at the hotel by coincidence? Come on.

19:42.061 --> 19:43.653
You can't do anything to stop her
anyway.

19:43.829 --> 19:47.265
- We're still her parents.
- And if you try, you're gonna lose her.

19:49.568 --> 19:50.762
He's probably right, you know.

19:55.574 --> 19:57.166
But you have some kind of plan,
right?

20:02.214 --> 20:04.580
Ladies and gentIemen,
this is the Iast and finaI caII

20:04.750 --> 20:08.777
to board FIight 86 to Las Vegas,
scheduIed for departure at 5 p,m,

20:08.954 --> 20:10.683
l can't believe we made it here
in one piece.

20:10.856 --> 20:11.948
What were you worried about?

20:12.124 --> 20:14.888
l don't know, maybe it was
that Cadillac we cut off on Barham

20:15.060 --> 20:17.324
or the big rig we almost jackknifed
on the freeway.

20:17.496 --> 20:19.794
- l told you we'd get here.
- Yeah, right on time.

20:19.965 --> 20:22.433
Hey, gotta hand it to Brenda.
Vegas is a great place to party--

20:22.601 --> 20:24.262
l told you,
we're not going there to party.

20:24.436 --> 20:26.666
Hey, what's the big deal?
Marriage, blackjack.

20:26.839 --> 20:29.808
- lt's all a crapshoot, right, man?
- Excuse me, son.

20:34.547 --> 20:36.777
Donna, maybe if you hadn't taken
so long to pack,

20:36.949 --> 20:38.416
we wouldn't have had to rush here.

20:38.584 --> 20:40.484
l wanted to be prepared.

20:40.653 --> 20:42.780
What do you have to bring
to Las Vegas? A few spangles?

20:42.955 --> 20:45.753
- A little see-through negligee?
- Kel, it's nothing like that.

20:45.925 --> 20:48.155
Yeah, maybe l should have brought
my Girl Scout uniform.

20:48.327 --> 20:49.692
Oh, my God, look who's here.

20:49.862 --> 20:52.296
- l told you it'd be a party.
- What are you guys doing here?

20:52.464 --> 20:54.557
We thought we'd catch
Wayne Newton's supper show.

20:54.733 --> 20:57.201
You don't think we'd let Brenda
get married without us, do you?

20:58.203 --> 20:59.227
Our seats are over there.

20:59.405 --> 21:02.272
- Oh, Donna.
- See you later.

21:03.742 --> 21:05.437
Who else did you tell, Steve?

21:05.611 --> 21:07.340
Only Kelly.

21:07.513 --> 21:09.777
And my good friend, E.

21:13.652 --> 21:15.916
Don't give me any hassle, okay?
lt's a late boarding pass.

21:16.088 --> 21:19.114
l already went through it with the guy
at the front desk. Hey, guys.

21:20.726 --> 21:23.923
Oh, come on, Bren, you know
what they say. The more, the merrier.

21:27.132 --> 21:28.258
David, you made it.

21:28.434 --> 21:30.129
Yeah, l got somebody
to cover my shift.

21:30.302 --> 21:31.735
Donna, l'm gonna go sit in the back.

21:31.904 --> 21:33.804
No, Kelly Taylor,
you come back here right now.

21:33.973 --> 21:36.032
We are all sitting together.

21:36.208 --> 21:37.232
Donna.

21:37.409 --> 21:39.377
Just let her go.
l don't wanna talk to her anyway.

21:39.545 --> 21:41.012
No.

21:41.180 --> 21:43.842
Can't the two of you put
your differences aside for one night?

21:44.483 --> 21:47.179
l mean, this is the biggest moment
in Brenda's life.

21:47.353 --> 21:49.014
And the last thing she
or any of us need

21:49.188 --> 21:52.021
are the two of you
at each other's throats.

21:55.127 --> 21:58.927
Yeah, l guess we could call
a temporary truce.

22:01.133 --> 22:03.101
Sort of like a national holiday?

22:04.737 --> 22:07.467
Gee, Kel,
would you like the window seat?

22:07.840 --> 22:10.240
No, David, l would never
deprive you of that. Go right ahead.

22:10.909 --> 22:12.433
Thank you so much.

22:24.723 --> 22:26.088
Look, David, l'm sorry.

22:26.859 --> 22:29.589
You know l hate this mess between
our parents just as much as you do.

22:30.529 --> 22:31.587
The worst part about it is,

22:31.764 --> 22:35.029
l had a sister for a year
and now l miss that.

22:38.203 --> 22:39.727
Me too.

22:40.072 --> 22:43.269
Out of all my mom's five marriages,
you're the only brother l ever had.

22:46.378 --> 22:49.279
Well, you know what,
if you're willing to give it another try,

22:49.448 --> 22:52.747
l've got this room at a great apartment
right on the beach.

22:52.918 --> 22:54.886
That is my room
and don't you forget it.

22:56.221 --> 22:59.213
l'm already crying.
l just love weddings.

22:59.391 --> 23:01.188
Will all passengers
please take their seats

23:01.360 --> 23:02.793
and fasten their seat belts?

23:02.961 --> 23:05.395
Please make sure your seat
is in the upright position.

23:05.564 --> 23:07.759
We'll be departing shortly.

23:07.933 --> 23:10.197
Dylan, you came.

23:10.836 --> 23:14.567
You kidding? l wouldn't miss
this wedding for the world.

23:25.584 --> 23:27.518
Room service.

23:29.154 --> 23:31.782
Oh, boy.
My last supper as a single woman.

23:31.957 --> 23:34.790
Well, you can't get married
on an empty stomach.

23:37.496 --> 23:38.588
My God.

23:40.265 --> 23:41.857
Here you go.

23:42.434 --> 23:44.766
This is turning out to be
everything that l had hoped for.

23:44.937 --> 23:48.498
Well, you ain't see nothing yet.
To the rest of our lives.

23:52.277 --> 23:55.075
l cannot believe we did it.
l mean, we got away from them all.

24:04.790 --> 24:07.884
Okay, if you have an ace,
it's worth one or it's worth 1 1 .

24:08.060 --> 24:10.153
lf you have a picture card,
it's worth ten.

24:10.329 --> 24:12.627
l wonder how long it takes
before you really know somebody.

24:12.798 --> 24:15.824
Okay, say you have a 1 6, the dealer
has a seven or higher showing,

24:16.001 --> 24:18.401
you ask the dealer for a hit
and he'll give you a third card.

24:18.570 --> 24:20.970
l mean, do you ever really know
what someone else is thinking?

24:21.140 --> 24:22.505
What are you thinking?

24:22.674 --> 24:26.610
The whole concept of human
connection, maybe it's just an illusion.

24:26.779 --> 24:29.077
Andrea, you need to listen
to me here now

24:29.248 --> 24:32.149
because we're going to Vegas and you
need to learn how to play twenty-one.

24:32.317 --> 24:34.649
But l'm not 21 . They're never
gonna let me into the casinos.

24:34.820 --> 24:36.651
They'll never check.

24:36.989 --> 24:39.514
- Twenty-one.
- Twenty-one.

24:39.691 --> 24:41.488
Wanna go to a wedding?

24:42.861 --> 24:45.591
Look, l respect the fact you don't
wanna interfere in Brenda's life.

24:45.764 --> 24:47.288
But now that she's gonna marry
this guy,

24:47.466 --> 24:49.627
you gotta tell me what you know
about Stuart Carson.

24:49.802 --> 24:52.464
Hey, don't get me started, all right?
l don't wanna get involved.

24:52.638 --> 24:56.199
Bro, you got involved
the second you set foot on this plane.

24:58.043 --> 24:59.772
All right.

25:00.179 --> 25:03.148
Used to be this place called
Eve's Apple. You ever heard of it?

25:03.782 --> 25:05.306
No. What was it,
some kind of nightclub?

25:05.484 --> 25:07.418
Yeah, some kind of nightclub.

25:07.586 --> 25:09.554
That's where everybody went
to score their drugs.

25:09.721 --> 25:13.282
Stuart was the manager, and when
he wasn't managing, he was dealing.

25:13.792 --> 25:14.850
Well, that settles it, man.

25:15.027 --> 25:17.518
We gotta figure out a way
to stop her from marrying this guy.

25:17.696 --> 25:20.893
Just because he was dealing then
doesn't mean he's dealing now.

25:21.066 --> 25:22.260
So, what are we supposed to do?

25:22.434 --> 25:24.664
Cross our fingers
and hope that he's cleaned up his act?

25:24.837 --> 25:27.965
Hey, man, let's just hope that
your sister knows what she's doing.

26:07.012 --> 26:09.344
You guys,
it was so wild getting off that airplane

26:09.514 --> 26:11.106
and seeing all those
aluminum palm trees.

26:11.283 --> 26:13.251
lt was like we were entering
a whole new universe.

26:13.418 --> 26:15.818
Wait till you see the moving statues
and the jousting matches.

26:15.988 --> 26:17.717
Circus Circus is by far the best.

26:17.890 --> 26:19.983
Yeah, l have to admit,
it's not quite what l expected.

26:20.158 --> 26:21.250
What did you expect?

26:21.426 --> 26:24.190
A lot of mobsters and hookers.

26:24.363 --> 26:26.228
No, l just didn't think
it was the kind of place

26:26.398 --> 26:28.491
you could bring your family to.

26:41.446 --> 26:42.606
Talk about an entrance.

26:42.781 --> 26:45.807
lt's from an old Marx Brothers movie.
Say the magic word, you win a duck.

26:45.984 --> 26:47.178
- Thanks, Groucho.
- l'm Harpo.

26:47.352 --> 26:50.287
- l'm Chico.
- No, no, no, l'm Chico. He's Zeppo.

26:51.390 --> 26:52.414
l think you're all crazy.

26:52.591 --> 26:54.252
All right, man,
what's on the agenda first?

26:54.426 --> 26:56.360
A little blackjack?
Maybe a little craps?

26:56.528 --> 26:58.086
Well, wait,
shouldn't we find Brenda?

26:58.263 --> 26:59.924
l don't know, Donna.
lt is their honeymoon.

27:00.098 --> 27:02.225
We did not come all this way
to leave them alone.

27:02.401 --> 27:05.063
- We have to give Brenda a shower.
- Yeah, a cold shower.

27:05.671 --> 27:08.071
Thank you.
You mean l am not the only one here

27:08.240 --> 27:11.334
who thinks
this is just a little bit ridiculous?

27:11.743 --> 27:13.973
This has to be the most idiotic thing
Brenda's ever done.

27:14.413 --> 27:16.847
You don't know what she was like
when she was a kid.

27:17.015 --> 27:18.039
So, what do we do?

27:18.216 --> 27:20.980
We have to go and find her
and tell her how we feel about all this.

27:21.153 --> 27:24.122
l don't think that's a good idea.
The first one of us that tries to stop her

27:24.289 --> 27:26.348
is just gonna be driving her
to the nearest chapel.

27:26.525 --> 27:28.220
Yeah, he's right.
The thing we have to do

27:28.393 --> 27:30.384
is make her think
that we're all behind her on this,

27:30.562 --> 27:32.928
make it out like this is the coolest thing
she's ever done.

27:33.098 --> 27:35.191
But all the time,
we gotta drop these little bombs

27:35.367 --> 27:37.232
that hopefully will make her
come to her senses.

27:37.636 --> 27:38.660
Brilliant.

27:38.837 --> 27:41.829
Yeah, because if we do it right,
it'll drive her up the wall.

27:42.007 --> 27:43.031
So we all set to go?

27:43.208 --> 27:45.142
Well, the honeymooners
are in Suite 1 096.

27:45.310 --> 27:47.471
- Thank you, Rosie the maid.
- Thank you, Steve Sanders.

27:48.914 --> 27:51.883
- Then let's do it.
- All right. Guys, wait a minute.

27:52.050 --> 27:54.416
We got Brenda figured out.
What about Stuart?

27:57.522 --> 27:58.682
l'll take care of Stuart.

28:01.893 --> 28:04.623
l wonder what my life is gonna be like
as a married woman.

28:04.796 --> 28:07.230
Nothing like my mother's,
that's for sure.

28:07.399 --> 28:09.993
Well, you can do charities or
join clubs.

28:10.168 --> 28:12.796
Or do nothing. lt's all up to you.

28:12.971 --> 28:15.201
What about my career?

28:15.640 --> 28:16.868
Darling, don't misinterpret me.

28:17.042 --> 28:20.534
Anything is possible, as long as it
doesn't take you away from me.

28:20.712 --> 28:24.113
Have l told you that l love you
within the last ten minutes?

28:24.683 --> 28:26.844
Think you're just about due.

28:29.321 --> 28:31.312
That must be housekeeping
to turn down the bed.

28:31.490 --> 28:34.220
Well, tell them
the bed's already turned down.

28:35.427 --> 28:38.726
- l can't believe how rude they are.
- l'll get it.

28:43.635 --> 28:45.159
Surprise!

28:46.338 --> 28:47.771
How did you guys
all know l was here?

28:48.273 --> 28:50.400
- Who do you think?
- Oh, you've got the biggest mouth.

28:50.575 --> 28:53.806
l just thought you'd want all your
friends to see you cross the threshold.

28:53.979 --> 28:55.571
l've been thinking about you guys
all day.

28:55.747 --> 28:57.442
Well, how about it?
Have you done it yet?

28:57.616 --> 28:58.674
Done what, Kelly?

28:58.850 --> 29:00.408
Get married. Are we too late?

29:00.585 --> 29:03.281
Nope. Stuart and l decided to get
married at the stroke of midnight.

29:03.455 --> 29:04.854
lsn't that romantic?

29:05.023 --> 29:07.821
Yeah, that's real cool. Let's go.

29:09.227 --> 29:10.626
Dylan, l am so glad you're here.

29:11.263 --> 29:13.163
Well, l got to thinking about it.
You're right.

29:13.331 --> 29:15.231
l have no right to tell you
how to run your life.

29:15.734 --> 29:18.294
You're a smart young woman
and you'll do fine.

29:18.470 --> 29:20.267
l wouldn't miss it for the world.

29:23.408 --> 29:24.670
What's going on out here?

29:24.843 --> 29:27.471
Well, looks like
we have some company.

29:29.581 --> 29:32.448
Well, everyone,
welcome to my honeymoon.

29:33.285 --> 29:36.015
Not yet. Not until your bachelor party,
tough guy.

29:36.188 --> 29:38.088
And you are getting a bridal shower.

29:39.691 --> 29:42.216
Well, it wasn't on the itinerary,
but what the hell?

29:42.394 --> 29:43.827
Well, okay.

29:45.797 --> 29:47.662
Room service, this is Suite 1 096.

29:47.833 --> 29:50.131
l need three magnums
of your finest champagne.

29:50.302 --> 29:53.169
And l want you to charge it
to Stuart Carson. Carson.

29:53.338 --> 29:56.796
And l need a peanut butter
and banana sandwich. Thank you.

29:57.776 --> 29:59.243
This suite is incredible.

29:59.411 --> 30:01.971
Oh, well, come on
and l'll show you the rest.

30:03.448 --> 30:06.246
Stewie. Stewie.

30:06.418 --> 30:09.285
l can't believe you guys just hopped
on a plane. Talk about good friends.

30:09.454 --> 30:11.149
- lt's more like a family.
- Get used to it.

30:11.323 --> 30:13.883
You're just not marrying Brenda,
you're inheriting a whole family.

30:14.059 --> 30:16.152
Take all the girls, for instance.
They're inseparable.

30:16.328 --> 30:19.092
They're either talking on the phone
or at each other's house.

30:19.264 --> 30:22.199
And you'll get to know all of them
just as well as you know Brenda.

30:22.367 --> 30:24.995
- They will get to know you.
- Know what's great about these girls?

30:25.170 --> 30:26.660
There's never any secrets
between them.

30:26.838 --> 30:30.035
l mean,
Brenda tells these girls everything.

30:31.409 --> 30:33.172
Wow, look at this bed. lt's huge.

30:33.345 --> 30:35.074
l bet you even have a sauna
in your bathroom.

30:35.247 --> 30:36.271
And a steam room.

30:36.448 --> 30:39.576
This suite must cost a fortune.
Well, good thing Stuart has one.

30:39.751 --> 30:41.742
Yeah, you're lucky
he didn't make you sign a prenup.

30:42.220 --> 30:43.312
Well, actually, he did.

30:44.856 --> 30:45.880
But it's no big deal.

30:46.057 --> 30:47.752
l mean, he's tearing it up
after six months.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.551
Well, then l guess
there's nothing to worry about.

30:50.729 --> 30:52.128
l'm just glad we're all together.

30:52.297 --> 30:53.321
Yeah, me too.

30:53.498 --> 30:55.295
Now you guys can be
my maids of honor.

30:55.467 --> 30:58.527
- l would've killed you if you didn't ask.
- Well, when you all showed up here

30:58.703 --> 31:00.796
l thought that you had come
to try and stop me.

31:02.007 --> 31:03.497
Why would we wanna stop you?

31:05.110 --> 31:06.475
Hey, everybody, listen up.

31:06.645 --> 31:08.579
This is a great suite,
but what are we doing here?

31:08.747 --> 31:10.009
Come on, this is Vegas.

31:10.182 --> 31:11.911
Buck and a half to win 9 and a half.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.243
Yo, eleven.

31:14.586 --> 31:15.917
Oh, my God.

31:23.662 --> 31:25.425
Okay, who's feeling lucky?

31:25.597 --> 31:26.655
You guys, we can't do this.

31:26.831 --> 31:28.628
We're underage. lt's against the law.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.734
Come on, Andrea,
like they're really gonna check.

31:30.902 --> 31:32.164
Well, what if they do?

31:32.337 --> 31:33.770
Would you guys
stop worrying so much?

31:33.939 --> 31:36.874
Nobody's even looking.
Just go for it.

31:37.609 --> 31:39.133
Fine.

31:49.554 --> 31:51.283
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

31:51.456 --> 31:53.788
Oh, my God!

31:54.426 --> 31:55.859
Quick, grab a cup, grab a cup.

31:56.027 --> 31:57.858
This is fantastic? Oh, l love Vegas.

31:58.029 --> 31:59.690
Talk about beginner's luck.

31:59.864 --> 32:01.161
This is great, just keep talking.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.460
- Oh, this is amazing.
- How much do you think is here?

32:03.635 --> 32:05.626
l don't know,
but let's go cash it all in, come on.

32:05.804 --> 32:08.204
What, are you kidding?
This machine's hot, we can't stop now.

32:08.373 --> 32:10.273
Oh, yes, you can.

32:11.009 --> 32:12.567
l need to see some lD, please.

32:13.511 --> 32:14.535
Do we look under 21 ?

32:14.713 --> 32:16.772
l gotta tell you, that's a big compliment.
Thank you.

32:16.948 --> 32:19.712
Let's see a driver's license
or a picture lD.

32:20.385 --> 32:21.443
You're kidding, right?

32:21.620 --> 32:24.919
Come on. You don't have to leave the
hotel, but you can't stay in the casino.

32:25.090 --> 32:28.491
And l believe 500 of those dollars
belongs to us.

32:28.660 --> 32:30.719
Anything left over
you can pick up at the cashier's.

32:39.537 --> 32:41.232
Welcome to Las Vegas.

32:42.707 --> 32:44.902
Never check, huh?

32:52.751 --> 32:54.548
Steve, l ain't going down there.

32:54.719 --> 32:56.983
Come on, pal,
you wanna borrow my lD, it's cool.

32:57.155 --> 32:59.350
Bro, you know
that's not the problem.

32:59.524 --> 33:02.220
Great. You won't gamble with me,
Dylan won't drink with me.

33:02.394 --> 33:04.794
And you probably wanna back out
of your bachelor party, right?

33:04.963 --> 33:06.328
Hey, l'm not turning into a monk.

33:06.498 --> 33:08.625
l know this great place
just outside the city limits

33:08.800 --> 33:10.927
that doesn't serve any booze,
so you guys can get in.

33:11.870 --> 33:12.928
No drinks?

33:13.104 --> 33:14.196
You'll live, Steve.

33:14.372 --> 33:16.840
Believe me,
the girls in this place make up for it.

33:17.008 --> 33:19.533
Yeah? Sounds like you're
still the swinging guy, Stuart.

33:19.711 --> 33:22.544
No way, man. These days
l'm on the straight and narrow.

33:22.714 --> 33:25.046
After some of the stuff
that's happened to me...

33:25.216 --> 33:27.081
Like what?

33:27.252 --> 33:29.345
Dylan, you knew me in the old days.

33:29.521 --> 33:33.048
You think l'd be marrying Brenda
if that's what l was still into?

33:34.326 --> 33:35.554
l guess not.

33:35.727 --> 33:37.957
What are we gonna do,
stand around here and talk about it

33:38.129 --> 33:40.495
or are we gonna make a move,
you know what l'm saying?

33:40.665 --> 33:42.292
Let's go.

33:44.903 --> 33:47.064
Okay, it's gonna be
a little harder than l thought.

33:47.238 --> 33:48.671
Yeah. l'm beginning to like the guy.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.967
- You too?
- Yeah.

34:12.530 --> 34:13.554
What's so funny?

34:15.033 --> 34:19.129
l was just picturing Vivian Carson's
face when she finds out

34:19.304 --> 34:23.001
that all 350 of her closest friends
are gonna miss the wedding.

34:31.315 --> 34:32.840
Honey, what are we doing?

34:34.319 --> 34:37.914
l don't know.
Making ourselves miserable.

34:39.257 --> 34:41.851
There's still time
to catch a flight to Vegas.

34:42.494 --> 34:43.620
What about what Brandon said?

34:44.396 --> 34:46.795
lf we're gonna lose Brenda,
we might as well go down fighting.

34:46.965 --> 34:48.728
l'm gonna go pack.

34:49.734 --> 34:51.429
l'll call the airlines.

34:51.603 --> 34:53.628
Here we go.

35:01.579 --> 35:04.776
Only in Las Vegas would they have
a bridal shop in the hotel lobby.

35:04.949 --> 35:07.008
Yeah, and one that's still open
at 1 1 p.m.

35:07.185 --> 35:08.209
Lucky for us.

35:08.386 --> 35:10.286
l didn't notice until l was
in the dressing room,

35:10.455 --> 35:11.649
that this is a polyester blend.

35:11.823 --> 35:13.916
l mean, how can l get married
in a wash-and-wear gown?

35:14.092 --> 35:15.582
Well, it's the sentiment that counts.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.022
Well, it's something new.

35:17.195 --> 35:19.425
l've had this handkerchief
of Grandma Rose's for years.

35:19.597 --> 35:20.928
Definitely something old.

35:21.099 --> 35:24.330
Okay, and here's something borrowed.
Now, you give that back.

35:24.502 --> 35:26.026
And something blue.

35:26.204 --> 35:27.501
A garter?

35:27.672 --> 35:30.334
Well, l was gonna surprise you
with it later, but there you go.

35:30.508 --> 35:32.408
l guess that just about
takes care of everything.

35:32.577 --> 35:34.477
Well, except for the ceremony.

35:34.646 --> 35:36.011
This is so weird.

35:36.181 --> 35:39.844
You know, the last wedding
l was at was Mel and Jackie's.

35:40.218 --> 35:42.482
But l'm sure yours will work out
much better than theirs.

36:02.974 --> 36:06.637
Oh, would you check out
the set of headlights on that chick?

36:06.811 --> 36:11.145
David, those are not headlights,
those are high beams.

36:11.549 --> 36:13.642
l think l'm in love.

36:14.552 --> 36:15.746
l gotta hand it to you, Stuart.

36:15.920 --> 36:19.515
l mean, l just don't think l could spend
the rest of my life stuck to one girl.

36:25.063 --> 36:26.724
Well,
when you got a girl like Brenda...

36:26.898 --> 36:29.423
Oh, yeah, l'm sure she's grown up
a lot since we were together.

36:29.601 --> 36:31.091
Yeah, l'm sure she has.

36:31.269 --> 36:33.567
Because back then,
fidelity wasn't really her strong suit.

36:33.738 --> 36:35.069
You know what l'm saying?

36:35.240 --> 36:37.936
But that's ancient history.
You don't wanna hear about that.

36:38.109 --> 36:40.043
Well, maybe l should.

36:40.478 --> 36:42.446
There was this guy
in her aerobics class.

36:42.614 --> 36:43.638
Aerobics class?

36:43.815 --> 36:45.942
Then she had a boyfriend in Paris.

36:46.117 --> 36:47.141
Paris?

36:47.318 --> 36:48.808
Yeah.
She said it didn't mean anything.

36:48.987 --> 36:51.251
You know what?
lt probably didn't mean anything.

36:51.422 --> 36:54.880
l mean, we were just both too young
to settle down.

36:55.293 --> 36:57.818
Yeah, well, you know,
this is a whole different situation.

36:57.996 --> 36:59.293
Yeah, you know, l'm sure it is,

36:59.464 --> 37:03.230
l'm sure that you know Brenda
a lot better than l do.

37:23.755 --> 37:26.553
Look at the time, would you?
We gotta get out of here.

37:26.724 --> 37:28.885
Yeah, Stu.
You're about to get hitched.

37:43.441 --> 37:44.703
There's still no answer.

37:44.876 --> 37:46.605
Try Stuart's room again.
Maybe they're there.

37:46.778 --> 37:49.838
Honey, we've called them half a dozen
times. What if we're too late?

37:50.014 --> 37:52.574
Call the concierge, get a list
of all the wedding chapels in town.

37:52.750 --> 37:53.774
Yes.

37:58.623 --> 38:01.820
Now, on to the music.
l have Hawaiian, ''The War Chant.''

38:01.993 --> 38:05.394
lnspirational, ''Love Me Tender.''
Traditional, ''The Wedding March.''

38:05.563 --> 38:07.030
The Hawaiian War Chant?

38:07.198 --> 38:08.961
How about if we just take
''The Wedding March''?

38:09.133 --> 38:10.498
Yeah, that's good.
That sounds good.

38:10.668 --> 38:12.101
And as an extra added touch,

38:12.270 --> 38:15.535
we also offer celebrants
to throw rice as you leave the chapel.

38:15.707 --> 38:17.368
l don't think we need
any more celebrants.

38:17.542 --> 38:19.407
- But you do want the rice?
- Rice sounds good.

38:19.577 --> 38:23.479
Good. Okay, that's 55 for the license
and the silver-embossed license holder,

38:23.648 --> 38:25.843
40 for the ceremony,
1 5 for the audiocassette,

38:26.017 --> 38:28.076
40 for the videocassette,
25 for the photos,

38:28.252 --> 38:30.379
40 for the live organist and the rice.

38:30.555 --> 38:33.786
Which makes a grand total of $21 5.
Would that be cash or charge?

38:41.432 --> 38:45.801
You know, Donna,
now would be as good a time as any.

38:45.970 --> 38:47.028
For what?

38:47.205 --> 38:49.139
For me and you to get married.

38:49.307 --> 38:50.899
Have you lost your mind?

38:51.075 --> 38:54.374
Tomorrow we can have it annulled,
but tonight...

38:54.545 --> 38:57.639
David Silver,
you have lost your mind.

38:58.116 --> 38:59.845
lt was worth a shot.

39:00.585 --> 39:04.453
So, Stuart, a few more moments
of freedom left. You ready?

39:04.622 --> 39:05.850
Yeah, l'm ready.

39:06.024 --> 39:08.049
That's good. Got the ring?

39:09.627 --> 39:12.687
You can't hold your own ring, man,
that's what you got a best man for.

39:12.864 --> 39:13.956
l really don't have one.

39:14.132 --> 39:17.499
Well, you know, you got one now.

39:22.507 --> 39:23.667
This is hopeless.

39:23.841 --> 39:25.638
Keep trying.

39:31.182 --> 39:33.582
Yes, have a Stuart Carson
and a Brenda Walsh

39:33.751 --> 39:35.184
gotten married in your chapel today?

39:35.353 --> 39:36.718
WeII, ma'am,
they're here right now,

39:36.888 --> 39:39.448
They are? Right now?

39:39.624 --> 39:40.682
HeIIo?

39:49.467 --> 39:52.732
Well, it's a good thing
we got here early to get a good seat.

39:57.408 --> 39:59.774
Brandon, l am really nervous.

39:59.944 --> 40:02.378
Nothing to be nervous about,
is there?

40:02.547 --> 40:06.005
No. l'm just glad you're here
to give me away.

40:06.184 --> 40:07.583
Yeah, me too.

40:07.752 --> 40:11.119
Although l know
Dad would've loved to have done it.

40:11.289 --> 40:12.756
Yeah, l know.

40:12.924 --> 40:16.826
You know, l think eventually
he'll accept Stuart as his son.

40:16.994 --> 40:20.259
After all, it is till death do you part.

40:22.734 --> 40:24.725
Well, this is it.

40:41.753 --> 40:47.658
ln a world of alienation and poverty
and war and misery,

40:47.825 --> 40:52.694
perhaps we most truly reveal
our belief in possibilities

40:52.864 --> 40:57.631
when we make the commitment
to share our lives forever.

40:58.603 --> 40:59.763
And ever and ever.

40:59.937 --> 41:03.236
lt is not a decision
entered into lightly.

41:03.775 --> 41:07.802
For marriage is not a gambol
across sunlit meadows.

41:07.979 --> 41:09.003
Oh, no.

41:09.547 --> 41:11.572
lt's a long and arduous journey

41:11.749 --> 41:15.742
through a dark forest
fraught with unseen dangers

41:15.920 --> 41:19.549
and sometimes disappointments.

41:19.724 --> 41:25.822
But it is the ultimate testament
of man's refusal to accept despair.

41:27.999 --> 41:32.060
So at this time l turn
to the congregation and l say:

41:32.236 --> 41:36.229
lf anybody here knows why these two
should not be joined in holy matrimony,

41:36.407 --> 41:40.605
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

41:52.490 --> 41:54.014
l do.

41:55.359 --> 41:58.851
Not yet.
l haven't asked you the question.

42:00.131 --> 42:03.396
No, no, no. Just wait, wait.

42:05.469 --> 42:08.666
- Stuart, l don't know how to say this.
- No, it's okay. Go ahead.

42:10.408 --> 42:13.002
Look, these last few weeks...

42:13.778 --> 42:17.612
l don't think anyone could imagine
asking for anything more.

42:17.782 --> 42:21.684
lt's been the most exciting time
in my entire life.

42:22.153 --> 42:23.586
l know.

42:25.923 --> 42:29.950
Look, l thought l was in love with you.
But l'm more in love with love.

42:30.127 --> 42:32.357
- l mean, do you understand?
- Yes. l do.

42:32.530 --> 42:34.930
When l look at my parents,
they've been married for 20 years.

42:35.099 --> 42:36.930
lt's been such hard work.
You know, l realize--

42:37.101 --> 42:39.001
We hardly know each other.

42:41.606 --> 42:43.130
You don't want us
to get married either.

42:44.642 --> 42:46.906
Oh, thank God.

42:48.412 --> 42:51.108
All right, that's it!
Stop the wedding! Stop the wedding!

42:51.282 --> 42:52.340
Dad, what are you doing?

42:52.516 --> 42:54.245
We're not gonna let you
go through with this.

42:54.418 --> 42:56.978
We are stopping the wedding
right here and right now.

42:57.154 --> 42:58.849
Too late, guys.
lt's already been stopped.

43:01.225 --> 43:02.715
Good.

43:03.361 --> 43:05.352
- Good.
- Right.

43:06.998 --> 43:10.490
l can't believe all of you were just
standing there watching it happen.

43:10.668 --> 43:12.101
Come on,
what were we supposed to do?

43:12.270 --> 43:13.703
You know how Brenda is.

43:13.871 --> 43:16.465
Guys, you know,
it's not too late to hit the tables.

43:16.641 --> 43:18.905
We could catch the 2:00 show
of Siegfried and Roy.

43:19.076 --> 43:20.134
l have to get some sleep.

43:20.311 --> 43:23.474
You know, l hate to admit it,
but they look great together.

43:33.891 --> 43:35.722
You know,
but for a small turn of fate,

43:35.893 --> 43:38.157
this would have been
our wedding dance.

43:38.329 --> 43:40.297
You're lucky to have
so many good friends.

43:41.065 --> 43:42.862
Well, there's always room
for one more.

43:44.368 --> 43:47.394
You know,
somewhere along the way,

43:47.571 --> 43:51.530
l realized l was trying to create a life
for myself by becoming part of yours.

43:52.343 --> 43:54.368
lt's pretty pathetic, huh?

43:54.545 --> 43:58.037
Well, in a way, l guess l was
kind of doing the same thing too.

43:58.215 --> 43:59.546
Not that it wasn't wonderful.

43:59.717 --> 44:01.446
Oh, it was great while it lasted.

44:02.253 --> 44:04.744
You know, just because
you're not my husband

44:04.922 --> 44:06.617
doesn't mean l don't love you.

44:07.925 --> 44:09.392
Yeah.

44:09.994 --> 44:11.188
Well, we'll always have Vegas.

44:18.469 --> 44:21.131
Should we do
our special little dip here?
