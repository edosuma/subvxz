Man on radio:
There's been a massive spike

this doesn't change everything.
It does.

This is a catastrophe
of biblical proportions.

Travis: We need to get away
from the city.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.588
We need to get away
from people.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.966
Just grab Alicia,
Liza, Chris,

03:40.137 --> 03:42.628

what this thing is.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.171

We're coming to get you.
I need you to pack

- His fever's, like, 103.
- What's wrong?

04:07.038 --> 04:10.246
I tried to get him in the bath,
but it hurts when I touch him.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.782
Don't-- don't touch him.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.077

Alicia, move away from him.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.322
What's wrong with you?

05:30.497 --> 05:32.783
People are getting sick.
It could be contagious.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.040
If he has it, l have it.

05:35.210 --> 05:39.749
Alicia, can I talk to him?
Please?

Hey, Matt.

They should be home soon.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.471
They're driving home today.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.139
When did this start?

06:00.485 --> 06:03.067
He was supposed to meet me
at the beach yesterday and...

06:03.238 --> 06:04.853
never showed up.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.612

06:29.014 --> 06:31.471
What are you doing?

06:33.518 --> 06:34.928
Is that a bite?

06:35.103 --> 06:36.809
Matt:
Yeah.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.597
- Is that how it happens?
- Travis: I don't know.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.517
I mean, Calvin was shot.
It wasn't-- it wasn't like--

06:43.695 --> 06:45.856
it wasn't like this.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.321
Get Alicia.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.027
What are you talking about?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.360
I'm gonna call 9-1-1

06:53.538 --> 06:54.618
- Okay, I'll wait for them here.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.869
- Mom.
- Don't do this.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.406
What the hell are you doing?
Are you psychotic?

06:57.584 --> 06:59.370
- He's sick.
- Alicia.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.339
It's okay.
It's okay.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.837
You want some water?

07:12.223 --> 07:14.054

(honking)

08:42.981 --> 08:44.642
Man:
What's going on?

08:44.816 --> 08:46.727
Cops shot
some homeless dude.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.357
Shot him, like, 20 times!

09:14.387 --> 09:17.049
Yeah.
You should come by.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.215
Gladys is nine.
You believe that? It's so scary.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.133
- That's great.
- Got a ton of food.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.019
We're getting a bunch of cancels
'cause of that bug going around.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.272
So we'll see you.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.683
Okay.
Okay, thanks.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.500
( door opens, closes)

09:51.549 --> 09:54.791
Mom, are you gonna tell her?
Mrs. Cruz?

09:54.969 --> 09:56.800
- Tell her what?
- What's happening.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.381
Nick, we don't know
what's happening.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.057
Well, we know more
than she does.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.433
Okay, I'll talk to her.
I'll tell her.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.975
It's just like
no one is paying attention.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.234
lt's-- it's like it's not real.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.780
It is.

It's real.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.074
Hey.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.581

10:34.092 --> 10:35.582
You saved us.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.427
You had no other choice.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.929
( breathes heavily )

10:43.935 --> 10:46.051
(sighs)

10:46.229 --> 10:50.347
I'm about to step into...
a world of shit.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.689
You know that, right?

10:58.283 --> 11:00.524
Yeah.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.943
Travis: Damn it.
No one's answering.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.863
No Liza, no Chris.
He's pushing my calls.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.996
Did you try Liza at her house?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.500
Of course I tried the house, Maddy.
Of course I did.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.082
Okay, go.
Travis, go get them now.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.793

11:18.845 --> 11:21.131
Mrs. Cruz:
There goes another one.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.888
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.097
Mrs. Cruz:
Well, should I get the cake?

11:31.649 --> 11:33.856
Call me if you're
gonna be longer.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.064
If I'm longer,
go without me.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.155
- l'll catch up.
- No.

- I'm on my way over.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.024
What? No.

We agreed he was staying
with me this weekend.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.367
ls Chris home from school?

12:23.534 --> 12:26.367

Something's happened.
I'll explain when | get there, okay?

12:28.873 --> 12:31.410
No, no, no. You can't keep
moving the goal-posts.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.040
Liza, Jesus.
Just--

12:33.211 --> 12:36.044
Our settlement agreement
was very clear.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.670
- ls Chris home?
- It's clear, Travis.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.671
- It is defined.
- You're not listening to me.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.423
You get him three weekends
a month.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.676
You can'tjust pick
and choose.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.973
- Can you just please call him?
- ( horns honking )

12:46.140 --> 12:47.471
Call him, tell him
to get his ass home.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.802
Liza:
He'll be home any minute.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.138
( honks horn )

12:51.312 --> 12:52.768
Travis:
Now, Liza!

12:52.939 --> 12:55.351
I'll see you next weekend.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.897

13:02.615 --> 13:04.606
Man: T.J., let's go, go.
Check it out.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.320
Woman:
Yeah, another homeless.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.138
Madison: Alicia. Alicia.
We need the bucket.

13:33.896 --> 13:37.480
Alicia?
Alicia, get the bucket.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.185
Dr. Han.
Hi, it's Maddy Clark again.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.854
Listen, uh, Nick is really
hurting right now,

13:45.033 --> 13:46.523
and | just need you
to call in the prescription

13:46.701 --> 13:48.612
so I can pick it up, but I'm
really worried about him,

13:48.786 --> 13:50.868
and I think
he really, really needs it.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.031
- Hang in there, big brother.
- ( breathing heavily )

13:54.208 --> 13:56.039
We're gonna get
your medicine, okay?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.121
Alicia: Longer we leave him,
the worse he gets.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.662
- I know. I'm aware.
- He won't be able to travel.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.877
- Alicia.
- I gotta get under the blanket.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.461
Mom, what are you gonna do?

14:07.638 --> 14:08.923
I don't know. Dr. Han's
not calling me back,

14:09.098 --> 14:10.554
and now I can't
even reach Travis.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.966
Well, yeah, I mean,
it's like after an earthquake.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.805
Circuits are overloaded.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.308
- Got anything stashed?
- No.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.563
Vicodin from my wisdom teeth.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.565
l flushed 'em.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.476
lt's dangerous for him
to go cold turkey like this.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.064
- I know. I know.
- Mom, |--

14:25.239 --> 14:26.319
- It's okay.
- The doctor's.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.231
You can pick 'em up.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.070
Mom.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.529
I don't even know--
I think they're closed.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.535
They're not calling me back.
By the time |--

14:33.706 --> 14:36.493
( distant sirens wailing )

14:37.585 --> 14:39.200
Watch him.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.335
- Prom-- do not leave the house.
- l wo-- I won't.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.213

- I'll look after him.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.585

Yo, Officer.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.232
- ( honks horn )
- What's going on out there?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.442
Was there an accident?

15:08.616 --> 15:10.117
lt'll clear up
past Sherman Oaks.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.366
I don't even know
why I asked you.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.632
( distant siren wailing )

15:53.494 --> 15:55.610
( alarm beeps, stops )

15:55.788 --> 15:58.120
( banging echoes)

16:07.508 --> 16:09.794
( clang echoes )

16:22.148 --> 16:24.514
( distant clang )

16:45.546 --> 16:47.707
( creaks )

17:39.517 --> 17:41.053
Oh, my God!

17:42.562 --> 17:45.099
- Hello, Miss C.
- Tobias.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.944
Can I have my knife back?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.440
( exhales )

17:57.535 --> 18:00.368
-( police radio chatter)
- ( car horns honking)

18:00.538 --> 18:03.371
- ( siren wailing)
- ( chatter)

18:06.127 --> 18:07.913
Man:
You know this ain't right.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.668
Yo, this is wrong, man.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.125
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.586
Back away, sir.
Get on with your business.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.045
This is his business.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.721
- This is all our business.
- Officer: Stay back.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.095
That man never hurt a fly.
That man was unarmed.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.474
- LAPD's out of control.
- ( crowd agrees )

18:23.644 --> 18:25.600
Officer: We're gonna need
to clear this area now.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.977
Man: Yo, we ain't
clearing nothing.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.479
Officer:
This is a crime scene.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.605
Man #2: Yeah, and we're
all behind the tape.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.641
Officer: lwill not tell
you people again.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.776
Man #2: Good, 'cause
we people aren't moving.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.357
Hey, kid,
put the camera down.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.615
No, no, no, homie.
Keep that camera up.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.572
I'm gonna give jackboot over
here a little civics lesson.

18:42.747 --> 18:43.907
You wanna go to jail, son?

18:44.081 --> 18:45.946
Jail? For what?
Freedom of speech?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.410
Right to lawful assembly?

18:47.585 --> 18:48.825
He ain't breaking any laws.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.334
Man, he ain't threatening
nobody.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.005
Oh, call your little buddy, yeah.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.009
( drawer slides open )

19:09.023 --> 19:11.139
( drawer slides shut)

19:11.317 --> 19:12.932
Be careful.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.852
Thank you.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.706
Here.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.213
Oh, can't do hot now.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.466
I'll make gazpacho
next time.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.172
Yeah. It's gonna end up
in the bucket.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.007
Can you drink some water?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.342
I'm not thirsty.
Water is not what I need.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.848
Yeah, I know
what you need, Nick.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.474
Mom's working on it.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.351
(child crying outside)

19:49.522 --> 19:51.353
( moans, retches )

19:51.524 --> 19:55.233
It's her party, and she'll cry
if she wants to.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.401
( Nick retching )

19:59.907 --> 20:02.865
(groaning, retching)

20:11.168 --> 20:12.328
Whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

20:12.503 --> 20:13.868
- Hey. Alicia.
- I'll be fast.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.422
No, no, no, no.
Hey, you can't go back there.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.422
Hey! You promised Mom.
Alicia, come--

20:18.592 --> 20:22.005
You make promises
all the time, Nick. Lie down!

20:22.179 --> 20:23.385
I'm an asshole.
I'm an asshole.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.763
Okay, but listen, Alicia, if you leave,
you won't come back.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.548
Please.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.809
- You let Mom go.
- Not safe. No, Matt!

20:29.979 --> 20:31.844
- Matt is not safe.
- Oh, Jesus...

20:32.022 --> 20:33.762
No, Alicia, you don't get
what it makes people do.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.272
You don't know
what I had to do, Alicia!

20:35.443 --> 20:37.229
- What did you have to do?!
- You don't know!

20:37.403 --> 20:40.520
Matt will hurt you!
He will kill you, Alicia. I'm--

20:40.698 --> 20:43.110
- ( thuds )
- ( objects clatter )

20:50.082 --> 20:51.117
( door opens)

20:51.292 --> 20:53.283
No, no, no, not now!

20:53.461 --> 20:54.951
Not now!

20:55.129 --> 20:57.040
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Not now!

20:57.214 --> 20:59.796
Don't you do this,
you stupid son of a bitch!

20:59.967 --> 21:01.082
(grunting)

21:03.304 --> 21:06.842
Stay still.
Shh.

21:09.852 --> 21:12.093
Why do I bother speaking?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.728
Seriously,
why do | waste my breath?

21:14.899 --> 21:16.890
- Is he here?
- You think I'm lying to you?

21:17.067 --> 21:19.319
We gotta find him.
It's not safe.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.943
This virus that's going around,

21:21.113 --> 21:23.490
the shootings the past few days,
it's connected.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.318
What are you talking about?

21:25.493 --> 21:27.609
Didn't you see what happened
on the freeway last night?

21:27.787 --> 21:29.903
I studied ti|| 2:00,
passed out.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.240
Well, people are getting sick.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.371
They get sick,
and they get violent.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.203
- And the cops shoot them.
- I've seen it.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.333
You know what I've seen?
Nothing.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.996
- It's getting worse.
- I don't know what to tell you.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.789
- What are you looking for?
- ( touch-tones beeping )

21:41.967 --> 21:43.252
Hey, just give me a second.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.963
( all chanting )
Hell, no! We won't go!

21:45.137 --> 21:47.173
Hell, no!
We won't go!

21:47.348 --> 21:49.964
( phone rings)

21:50.142 --> 21:51.382
Mom! Mom!

21:51.560 --> 21:52.720
Travis:
Where the hell are you?

21:52.895 --> 21:54.510
Dad, why do you
have Mom's phone?

21:54.688 --> 21:55.768
I'm with your mother.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.476
We're coming to get you.
Tell us where you are.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.857
There's a protest.
I'm at a protest.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.358
- A protest?
- Where is he?

22:01.529 --> 22:03.065
- Where?
- The cops,

22:03.239 --> 22:04.649
they shot some
homeless man, Dad.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.439
This poor guy,
he wasn't doing anything.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.153
Okay, let us
come and get you.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.034
The people were taking action.
This is important, Dad!

22:11.205 --> 22:13.116
Yeah, I get it.
| get it. Okay, but--

22:13.290 --> 22:14.541
Dad, I'm part of it, okay?

22:14.708 --> 22:16.289
I gotta go.
I gotta go, Dad.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.666
Chris--

22:17.837 --> 22:19.873
( chanting continues)

22:21.298 --> 22:22.799
I know where he is.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.217
Cafeteria food's designed
to survive a nuclear strike.

22:27.388 --> 22:30.551
Expires in, like, the year 3000.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.884
What did you come back for?

22:32.059 --> 22:34.641
Uh, Nick, my son,
is not feeling well.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.348
Well, that's smart.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.979
LAPD lockup,
they have pharmaceuticals.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.731
Nick was here
when l was a freshman.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.517
He seemed nice.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.812
Yeah, he's a good kid.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.480
Yeah.

22:47.658 --> 22:50.570
Uh, the looters
hit pharmacies first,

22:50.744 --> 22:54.077
then gun shops,
liquor stores.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.990
The less you go out,
the less chance you get exposed.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.872
(Tobias grunts)

23:05.676 --> 23:08.383
Hey, Miss C, have you
seen any of 'em yet?

23:08.554 --> 23:11.261
I mean, I've only
seen 'em online.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.548
No.
Let's hurry this up.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.186
Mother lode.

23:25.446 --> 23:26.856
Wow, you're stocking up
for a while.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.568
It's gonna be a while.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.949
So your mom's back, then?

23:32.119 --> 23:34.201
My uncle's been around.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.453
You should stock up,
too, Miss C.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.074
No, we have food.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.624
(scrubbing )

23:53.474 --> 23:56.090
I'm sorry.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.476
She should have been
back by now.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.308
Yeah, I know.

24:01.482 --> 24:04.599
Someone should
have called...

24:04.777 --> 24:06.233
by now.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.280
Thank you.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.405
(sighs)

24:22.795 --> 24:26.913
Mr. and Mrs. Cruz:
J‘ Happy birthday to you... J‘

24:27.091 --> 24:30.458
- I hate you.
- J‘ Happy birthday to you... J‘

24:30.636 --> 24:32.001
I know.

24:32.179 --> 24:38.015
J‘ Happy birthday,
dear Gladys J‘

24:38.185 --> 24:43.020
- J‘ Happy birthday to you. J‘
- ( sirens wailing)

24:43.190 --> 24:45.272
( cans rattling )

24:49.446 --> 24:50.697
Tobias:
The desert will be safer

24:50.864 --> 24:52.445
because things
will fall apart now.

24:52.616 --> 24:56.200
No satellites, no Internet,
no cell phones.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.577
Communications will fail
'cause no one's there

24:58.747 --> 24:59.862
to manage the servers.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.827
The electrical grid will
collapse for the same reason.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.993
It's all gonna go to hell.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.501
And that's what they don't get.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.879
When civilization ends,
it ends fast.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.710
They're gonna contain it.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.875
The same "they"
that's supposed to warn us?

25:14.388 --> 25:17.630
- Come on.
- ( distant rustling )

25:17.808 --> 25:19.514
(groaning)

25:19.685 --> 25:21.141
No, wait-- Miss C.

25:24.648 --> 25:28.687
( groaning on speakers)

25:29.695 --> 25:32.061
(groaning continues)

25:33.741 --> 25:35.072
It's one of them.

25:35.242 --> 25:38.154
( static crackling )

25:38.328 --> 25:40.705
(groaning continues)

25:44.501 --> 25:46.492
( distant alarm beeping )

25:46.670 --> 25:49.582
Let's go. Let's go.
Go, go, go, go.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.248
- Let's go.
-( beeping continues)

25:52.426 --> 25:54.508
Let's go. Go.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.427
Oh, God.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.092
Leaveit

26:03.270 --> 26:05.181
Tobias, leave it.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.563
Oh, God.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.602
Okay, get the door.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.271
Okay.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.940
Oh, God.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.109
Artie?

26:28.629 --> 26:30.540
Artie.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.464
-( raspy breathing )
- We-- we gotta go. We gotta go.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.099
(door rattling )

26:44.228 --> 26:45.843
Artie, can you hear me?

26:46.021 --> 26:47.636
He can't hear you.
You know he can't.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.978
We'll get you help, Artie.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.158
Artie, stop.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.615
We're gonna get you help, okay?
We'll get you--

27:04.790 --> 27:06.075
Tobias:
No, no.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.662
- No, stop!
- Tobias: No, no!

27:16.176 --> 27:17.586
Madison:
No, Tobias!

27:17.761 --> 27:20.173
- No, no, no, no! Ah!
- No! Tobias!

27:21.807 --> 27:23.672
Oh, no, no, no!

27:23.851 --> 27:24.931
(screaming )

27:25.102 --> 27:27.309
(grunting)

27:27.479 --> 27:29.435
Help me!

27:38.323 --> 27:39.938
Oh, no.
No, no!

27:41.869 --> 27:43.154
(grunting)

27:48.500 --> 27:51.207
- ( grunting)
- ( squelching)

27:51.378 --> 27:53.460
( panting )

28:28.832 --> 28:30.072
(engine starts)

28:30.250 --> 28:32.036
( crowd shouting )

28:34.254 --> 28:37.337
(Travis, echoing)
Chris!

28:37.507 --> 28:39.088
( crowd shouting )

28:39.259 --> 28:43.377
- Chris!
- Chris!

28:43.555 --> 28:46.547
( distorted voices )

28:46.725 --> 28:49.182
Chris!

28:55.609 --> 28:57.941
Liza:
Christopher James Manawa!

28:59.279 --> 29:01.361
- Christopher James Manawa.
- We gotta go, man.

29:01.531 --> 29:02.737
Dad, he was unarmed,
but they shot him.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.864
No, they shot him
like a dozen times.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.775
- Tell us on the way.
- I'm doing what you taught me.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.195
This is what you taught me.
Dad, we stand up for people.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.238
Travis: I know, I know, but
there's a time and a place--

29:11.416 --> 29:12.826
Chris: Right now.
This is happening right now.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.457
( conversation continues
indistinctly )

29:14.628 --> 29:17.119
(sirens wailing,
horn honking )

29:17.297 --> 29:18.457
Travis:
Liza!

29:18.632 --> 29:20.463
Enough.
( continues indistinctly )

29:20.634 --> 29:22.465
- Okay, we gotta go.
- This is important.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.376
Come on, man.
You're important, okay?

29:24.554 --> 29:25.634
Christopher,
listen to your father.

29:25.806 --> 29:28.889
( police radio chatter)

29:29.059 --> 29:30.720
Christopher, now!

29:30.894 --> 29:33.306
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you guys?

29:33.480 --> 29:36.222
- Are you kidding me?
- No, wait, wait. Stop.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.480
- Come on. Come on.
- This way.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.270
- Where are we going?
- ( canister fires )

29:43.448 --> 29:45.109
( rasping )

29:45.284 --> 29:47.775
Stop. Right now.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.818
On the ground!
On the ground! Stop!

29:49.997 --> 29:52.409
- ( gunshots )

29:55.669 --> 29:57.625
- ( woman screaming )
- Man: Get out! Get out!

30:00.090 --> 30:02.832
( helicopter blades
whirring )

30:03.010 --> 30:05.467
- ( woman screams )
- Man: Go! Go, man! Let's go!

30:32.039 --> 30:35.156
- Okay?
- ( woman speaks Spanish )

30:35.334 --> 30:37.666
- Thing of beauty.
- Looks good, looks good.

30:37.836 --> 30:38.996
Man:
Kick this wall down!

30:39.171 --> 30:41.412
Man #2: Man, what's
going on out here?

30:41.590 --> 30:44.206
Take the side.
Take the side.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.499
Go to your right.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.008
( people shouting )

30:47.179 --> 30:48.840
Chris:
Jeez!

30:53.518 --> 30:56.385
Excuse me, sir.
Can we come in, please?

30:56.563 --> 30:58.224
We're closed.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.480
Please, it's not safe out here.
I mean, it's dangerous.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.730
Go to the police.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.392
No, I think
they're the danger.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.901
I mean, they're not
letting anyone leave.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.482
We just need somewhere
to ride it out.

31:06.656 --> 31:07.645
Please. Please?

31:07.824 --> 31:09.530
( speaks Spanish )

31:11.495 --> 31:14.032
Please.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.195
Okay, come in.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.581
Thank you.

31:22.005 --> 31:25.418
( crowd shouting,
cheering )

31:28.053 --> 31:30.260
Do you have a back door?
Access to the alley?

31:30.430 --> 31:32.386
- There is no other door.
- Travis, please.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.843
Woman:
Hey, hey.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.428
- ( man speaks Spanish )
- Liza: Travis,

31:36.603 --> 31:37.683
- this is their home.
- ( woman speaks Spanish )

31:37.854 --> 31:39.230
Do you have access
to the roof?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.184
Travis, can you please
not go in there?

31:41.358 --> 31:43.394
We can see
what's coming there.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.433
You will be fine in there.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.773
I think it'll be safer if we
stay away from the front door.

31:47.948 --> 31:50.189
No, I think you will
be safer in there.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.107
Papa, I thought
you were locking up.

31:52.285 --> 31:55.197
( speaks Spanish )

31:55.372 --> 31:57.283
- Are you okay?
- We're fine.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.573
- Who are you?
- |'m-- I'm sorry.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.457
I'm sorry. I'm Travis.
This is my family.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.040
We just need somewhere to ride
it out, and then we'll go.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.954
- ( siren wailing)
- ( distant shouting )

32:07.300 --> 32:09.291
(distant banging )

32:09.469 --> 32:12.632
It's okay, Papa.
Please, have a seat in there.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.221
Thank you, thank you.
I'm sorry.

32:15.392 --> 32:16.882
Sorry.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.561

Thank you.

32:20.147 --> 32:23.981

32:30.490 --> 32:31.946
Woman on radio:
LA County health officials

32:32.117 --> 32:34.654
recommend Angelinos
stay inside.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.819
If you don't
need to travel, don't.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.830
If you must leave your house,
take precautions.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.991
Local neighborhood watch
programs are being established

32:42.169 --> 32:43.875
in many neighborhoods
throughout the city...

32:44.045 --> 32:45.581
( radio turns off)

32:51.845 --> 32:54.928
You can stay with us, Tobias,
until this is over.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.427
This doesn't end.

32:58.602 --> 33:00.558
There's room.
It's safe.

33:00.729 --> 33:03.562
You gotta take care
ofyourson.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.608
I'll be okay.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.156
You?

33:14.367 --> 33:16.028
Yeah.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.207
(car approaching )

33:52.322 --> 33:55.314
-( praying in Spanish)
- ( distant shouting )

34:06.753 --> 34:08.744

34:10.674 --> 34:13.256
Thank you.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.508
Thank my wife.

34:18.765 --> 34:22.098
( distant tires screech )

34:22.269 --> 34:24.180
This is insane.

34:24.354 --> 34:26.515
Chris, get away
from the window.

34:28.358 --> 34:29.393
Can't make anything out.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.183
You don't wanna see
anything out there.

34:31.361 --> 34:33.773
Okay?
Just, come on, step away.

34:33.947 --> 34:37.280
Sit down.
Read something.

34:37.450 --> 34:40.613
(siren wailing)

34:47.961 --> 34:50.293
What do you know?

34:50.463 --> 34:52.203
What have you seen?

34:52.382 --> 34:54.088
( distant shattering )

34:54.259 --> 34:56.796
- I've seen what people do.
- ( engine roars)

34:56.970 --> 34:59.302
What they don't do.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.590
- It doesn't make sense.
- ( glass shatters )

35:05.312 --> 35:07.803
They don't die, Liza.
They...

35:09.316 --> 35:10.556
( glass shatters )

35:10.734 --> 35:13.396
- ...come back.
- ( fire crackling )

35:17.449 --> 35:19.656
Gotta get far away
from what's outside.

35:19.826 --> 35:23.068
( car alarm blaring )

35:23.246 --> 35:24.656
All of us.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.622
( man shouting )

35:28.793 --> 35:31.330
( officer on P.A., indistinct)

35:31.504 --> 35:33.005
(tires squealing,
engine rewing )

35:33.173 --> 35:36.336
(sirens wailing,
horn honking )

35:39.512 --> 35:42.094
- Alicia: What took you so long?
- Shut the door.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.508
How's your brother?

35:46.686 --> 35:49.268
Never better.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.475
He went grand mal on me.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.561
I'm sorry.

35:55.528 --> 35:58.019
- Travis call?
- No.

36:11.461 --> 36:13.702
(pills rattling)

36:23.223 --> 36:25.009
We ration those.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.720
Oxy? Oxy's good.
How much?

36:27.894 --> 36:29.725
It's enough to get us
to the desert.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.137
And then what?

36:36.736 --> 36:38.818
Hey.
(snaps fingers)

36:38.988 --> 36:40.979
She tried to leave.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.740
Yeah.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.901
I stopped her.

36:54.254 --> 36:55.585
(tapping )

36:55.755 --> 36:57.370
Alicia:
Hey, Matt, it's me again.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.086
Can you give me a call?
I wanna know how you're doing.

37:37.422 --> 37:41.131
(crying )
No. No, God.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.589
(cell phone ringing)

37:54.272 --> 37:56.137
- Travis?
- Maddy. Maddy?

37:56.316 --> 37:59.149
- Travis? Hi.
- You can hear me?

37:59.319 --> 38:00.980
Yeah, baby, where are you?
Are you okay?

38:01.154 --> 38:04.271
Yeah, no, we're good.
I found Chris. He's safe.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.735
Where are you?
You okay?

38:06.910 --> 38:10.573
Yeah, we're okay.
Can you come home?

38:10.747 --> 38:13.113
We're stuck.
The freeway's jammed,

38:13.291 --> 38:15.156
and highway patrol's
figuring it out.

38:15.335 --> 38:17.121
l, um...

38:17.295 --> 38:19.832
Well, where are you?
You're at Liza's?

38:20.006 --> 38:22.338
No, no.
We're waiting in a shop.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.841
|-- how's Nick?
Is he okay?

38:25.011 --> 38:26.751
Did you find him the meds?

38:26.930 --> 38:29.171
Uh, yeah.
Uh...

38:30.517 --> 38:32.599
I got him enough,
you know, to wean him off.

38:32.769 --> 38:35.476
I mean, to take him to the
desert and just wean him off.

38:35.647 --> 38:36.978
- ( explosion )
- Oh, shit.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.013
Madison: Wait, Travis,
what was that?

38:39.192 --> 38:41.103
- Tell me what that was.

Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.485
Look, Maddy,
I want you to go.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.863
Go to the desert, now.
Don't wait.

38:47.033 --> 38:50.321
No, I'm gonna wait for you.
I'm gonna wait for you.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.326
Okay, I don't know
how long we're gonna be.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.362
Just go ahead. We'll catch up.
We'll find you, okay?

38:54.541 --> 38:56.372
No, Travis, just-- no--

38:56.543 --> 38:58.704
- ( gunshots )
- Whoa! Travis?

38:58.878 --> 39:01.210

39:01.381 --> 39:03.497
Officer over P.A.
By order of the LAPD,

39:03.675 --> 39:06.883
you must clear
the streets now.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.968
( crickets chirping )

39:16.563 --> 39:18.224
( beeps )

39:21.526 --> 39:23.391
(sighs)

39:28.658 --> 39:31.320

39:35.832 --> 39:37.663
What the hell happened?

39:39.377 --> 39:41.242
Mom?

Mom, are you okay?

but it hurts to pray... J‘

40:32.430 --> 40:33.590
(touch-tones beeping )

40:33.765 --> 40:37.053
J‘ The life l have
isn't what I've seen J‘

40:39.479 --> 40:42.812
J‘ The sky's not blue
and the field's not green... J‘

40:48.947 --> 40:51.063
(sighs)

40:53.993 --> 40:55.654
Dead again?

40:56.996 --> 40:58.497
Phone lines
keep going off and on.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.326
Power cuts out.

41:02.335 --> 41:05.702
Tell me.
What's going on?

41:08.925 --> 41:10.005
( distant woman screams )

Oh, God.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.135
Don't look.
Don't look.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.767
Mom, Mr. Dawson's

Get off!

41:31.280 --> 41:35.023
What are you doing?
Mom. Mom!
