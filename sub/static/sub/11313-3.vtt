00:10.190 --> 00:11.756
There's a lot of death.

00:11.758 --> 00:14.325
The ground is just saturated with it.

00:14.327 --> 00:17.028
The previous owner,
he committed suicide.

00:17.030 --> 00:20.365
There's a lot of
physical trauma going on.

00:20.367 --> 00:22.834
- You think he was killed?
- Yeah.

00:22.836 --> 00:24.636
Somebody keeps talking
about murder, murder,

00:24.638 --> 00:25.880
murder, murder, murder, murder, murder,

00:25.906 --> 00:26.905
murder, murder, murder, murder.

00:26.907 --> 00:28.973
There's something.
There's something here.

00:28.975 --> 00:33.011
It's trying to push
me away with a force.

00:33.013 --> 00:37.315
It very much hates
someone in this house.

00:37.317 --> 00:39.484
I just hear death.

00:39.486 --> 00:41.753
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.755 --> 00:43.388
God.

00:43.390 --> 00:45.390
It's like, "I'm going to get you."

00:45.392 --> 00:46.491
I see dead people.

00:46.493 --> 00:47.759
Her face was all demonic.

00:47.761 --> 00:49.494
I speak to dead people.

00:49.496 --> 00:52.297
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:52.299 --> 00:53.698
And they speak to me.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.233
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

00:55.235 --> 00:58.369
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.371 --> 01:00.371
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam!

01:00.373 --> 01:01.521
I rely on my partner.

01:01.621 --> 01:03.187
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.189 --> 01:04.922
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.924 --> 01:06.423
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

01:06.425 --> 01:09.627
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.629 --> 01:10.794
They're everywhere.

01:10.796 --> 01:12.196
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.198 --> 01:14.264
This guy's got the
markings of a serial killer.

01:14.266 --> 01:17.067
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.069 --> 01:19.103
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.105 --> 01:20.337
...until the very end...

01:20.339 --> 01:22.006
Is this dead guy doing that to her?

01:22.008 --> 01:23.874
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.876 --> 01:25.976
That's it.

01:25.978 --> 01:27.244
...or time to get out.

01:27.246 --> 01:31.482
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

01:45.831 --> 01:48.532
I'm in the small town of
Estill Springs, Tennessee.

01:48.534 --> 01:51.835
It's about 85 miles
southeast of Nashville.

01:51.837 --> 01:54.304
I got a call from a
young mother named Emily.

01:54.306 --> 01:55.739
She says whatever's in the house

01:55.741 --> 01:58.709
hates kids and was going
after her 3-year old son.

01:58.711 --> 02:00.144
She was hysterical on the phone,

02:00.146 --> 02:02.312
and I'm really hoping
we can help her out.

02:07.053 --> 02:08.252
Before Amy arrives,

02:08.253 --> 02:10.086
I sweep the house from top to bottom,

02:10.089 --> 02:12.756
looking for any leading information.

02:12.758 --> 02:16.060
Photographs, family heirlooms,

02:16.062 --> 02:18.796
even a baby's crib can
influence her findings.

02:18.798 --> 02:21.865
So it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

02:21.867 --> 02:23.200
When I'm done, the location

02:23.202 --> 02:24.902
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:34.146 --> 02:42.052
There's some nutty woman
running towards me screaming.

02:42.054 --> 02:43.987
She's got issues.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.956
She is very physical.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.492
She, like, can touch people.

02:48.494 --> 02:51.862
Like, she's got her arm on me now.

02:51.864 --> 02:54.164
Okay.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.966
What happened?

02:55.968 --> 03:00.370
She was doing creepy stuff that
actually kind of made me scared.

03:00.372 --> 03:03.907
She made it like death.

03:10.349 --> 03:12.816
When we spoke on the
phone, you sounded pretty upset.

03:12.818 --> 03:16.019
Most of it was because of your son, Eli.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.755
Yeah. We got him about a year ago.

03:17.757 --> 03:20.357
He was in an orphanage from China.

03:20.359 --> 03:22.126
He's waking up screaming in the night.

03:22.128 --> 03:23.994
I go in there, he is trembling.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.562
It's heartbreaking.

03:25.564 --> 03:27.765
He's obviously terrified.

03:27.767 --> 03:30.200
When you did adopt him, did
they give you any indication

03:30.202 --> 03:32.703
that he was having any issues
like you're talking about?

03:32.705 --> 03:35.072
He slept awesome. He slept all night.

03:35.074 --> 03:36.607
He took a 2-hour nap during the day.

03:36.609 --> 03:38.342
He had no issues.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.611
It's hard because we
brought him into this.

03:40.613 --> 03:42.012
Let me get some basic stuff from you.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.647
How long are you guys here?

03:43.649 --> 03:46.083
- We've been here about 4 years.
- Who's living in the house?

03:46.085 --> 03:49.052
Um, it is me, my husband, Christopher,

03:49.054 --> 03:51.755
and my son, Eli.

03:51.757 --> 03:53.824
And recently, my youngest sister, Abby,

03:53.826 --> 03:55.793
and her 4 year-old son have moved in.

03:55.795 --> 03:58.428
If you can, just give
me an abbreviated version

03:58.430 --> 03:59.963
of what you guys are going through here.

03:59.965 --> 04:03.667
Well, we've heard voices,
a feeling of being watched.

04:03.669 --> 04:05.602
We've seen shadow people.

04:05.604 --> 04:08.205
And me and my husband both
have pretty extreme mood swings.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.807
And when you say the mood swings,

04:09.809 --> 04:11.141
what are we talking about?

04:11.143 --> 04:12.843
He's very irritable.

04:12.845 --> 04:16.046
He seems anxious and nervous
about things all the time.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.081
I mean, that can't be
good for the marriage?

04:18.083 --> 04:21.718
It's really hard.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.854
I should be happy to be
in this home with him,

04:23.856 --> 04:25.355
with our new baby.

04:25.357 --> 04:27.558
So if we can't fix the problem
with the paranormal here,

04:27.560 --> 04:28.992
what do you think would happen?

04:28.994 --> 04:31.094
Worse things would happen to Eli.

04:31.096 --> 04:34.531
I fear that it will get to
the point where he gets hurt.

04:34.533 --> 04:37.167
I feel like it targets children.

04:40.206 --> 04:46.410
So this lady, she's talking
about kids, little children.

04:46.412 --> 04:50.247
She doesn't want me to go in this house.

04:50.249 --> 04:54.852
She very much hates
someone in this house.

04:54.854 --> 04:56.520
It feels like a male.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.493
Okay, so I got punched in the stomach.

05:03.495 --> 05:04.995
Do you know what by?

05:04.997 --> 05:06.330
Her.

05:06.332 --> 05:08.699
****.

05:08.701 --> 05:11.401
That hurt like a ****.

05:17.176 --> 05:19.309
This room's pretty bad for me.

05:19.311 --> 05:23.247
I wake up seeing shadow
people standing by my bed.

05:23.249 --> 05:25.716
I mean, I wake Christopher
up, and he keeps a baseball bat

05:25.718 --> 05:27.417
by the bed because I've said,
"There's someone in the room.

05:27.419 --> 05:28.785
There's someone here."

05:28.787 --> 05:30.587
What are we talking about as
far as how often you see this?

05:30.589 --> 05:31.822
Once a week, once a month.

05:31.824 --> 05:34.524
It's easily a couple
times a week, if not more.

05:34.526 --> 05:36.493
All right. So a couple
times a week, that's scary.

05:36.495 --> 05:37.794
Yeah, it's a lot.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.263
And since we've gotten Eli,

05:39.265 --> 05:41.298
it seems to be that he's seeing it now,

05:41.300 --> 05:43.901
and that's what's waking him up.

05:43.903 --> 05:45.769
All right. So has
anything else happened?

05:45.771 --> 05:49.039
Yes, I feel someone sitting on this bed.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.774
How often is this happening?

05:50.776 --> 05:53.076
At least once a week.

05:53.078 --> 05:55.312
Do you think it's trying
to get into bed with you?

05:55.314 --> 05:58.649
I think it's sitting there
and wants to watch me.

05:58.651 --> 06:00.417
How the hell are you sleeping?

06:00.419 --> 06:03.086
I don't sleep very well.
I mean, I'm 32 years old.

06:03.088 --> 06:04.721
I'm sleeping with three night-lights.

06:04.723 --> 06:06.490
Well, listen, you're
going through hell here.

06:08.961 --> 06:11.561
What she's doing, I know, is not good.

06:11.563 --> 06:14.598
Yeah, she is **** physical.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.935
She can move things.
She can touch people.

06:17.937 --> 06:20.270
I think that she's very capable of,

06:20.272 --> 06:22.973
like, making noise?

06:22.975 --> 06:24.708
She can do a lot of crazy stuff.

06:29.548 --> 06:31.148
What's going on in here?

06:31.150 --> 06:33.116
I saw a shadow figure,

06:33.118 --> 06:35.385
and it was at this end of his bed.

06:35.387 --> 06:38.021
And it was, like,
peeking over like this.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.489
Describe what it looked like.

06:39.491 --> 06:40.891
It was tall, dark.

06:40.893 --> 06:42.693
I could see the head and the shoulders.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.962
You couldn't see
through it. It was solid.

06:44.964 --> 06:46.763
I thought someone was in his room,

06:46.765 --> 06:48.265
but I was frozen.

06:48.267 --> 06:50.100
It was horrible. I was terrified.

06:50.102 --> 06:52.536
I was terrified for him.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.204
It scares me right now to talk about it,

06:54.206 --> 06:56.239
to be honest.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.674
Yeah, I can see that.

06:57.676 --> 07:00.777
It just was the worst experience
I have ever had in this house.

07:00.779 --> 07:04.414
He was in an orphanage with no family.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.149
To think that it's worse here

07:06.151 --> 07:07.684
with a mom and dad that love him...

07:07.686 --> 07:09.586
That's upsetting. Don't
feel guilty, though.

07:09.588 --> 07:12.122
Is there anything else?

07:12.124 --> 07:15.359
My niece told me that she saw a monster,

07:15.361 --> 07:17.894
and it had a cape and red eyes.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.463
No arms, no legs.

07:19.465 --> 07:20.897
And she said she could see the body,

07:20.899 --> 07:22.733
like, moving up and down.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.434
I guess, like it was breathing?

07:24.436 --> 07:26.036
So is it possible he's seeing that?

07:26.038 --> 07:28.171
I mean, he's waking up screaming.

07:28.173 --> 07:31.742
He's pointed over there,
said, "Scare me, scare me."

07:31.744 --> 07:36.847
I feel like they want...

07:36.849 --> 07:38.882
that they want him.

07:38.884 --> 07:42.185
I definitely feel
like they're after him.

07:49.995 --> 07:54.031
What I'm hearing is weird noises,

07:54.033 --> 07:56.233
but then it's, like,
almost, like, inhuman?

07:56.235 --> 07:57.968
Like growling?

07:57.970 --> 07:59.903
But it's, like, coming from, like,

07:59.905 --> 08:01.772
everywhere.

08:01.774 --> 08:04.141
Trying to push me away,

08:04.143 --> 08:07.411
with a force.

08:07.413 --> 08:10.180
And it doesn't sound human.

08:17.022 --> 08:18.922
You seeing it?

08:18.924 --> 08:22.526
I'm seeing a version of it.

08:22.528 --> 08:24.061
Can you describe it?

08:24.063 --> 08:26.963
It's, like, got long legs and arms,

08:26.965 --> 08:30.333
but it crawls on all four.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.968
It's got a weird body.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.671
And then, like, a
weird human-shaped face.

08:34.673 --> 08:37.674
It's like screaming and ****.

08:37.676 --> 08:40.077
It is a force.

08:40.078 --> 08:43.280
It's a legitimate force.

08:43.282 --> 08:45.949
This sucker is really evil.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.811
So, Abby, I understand that
you recently moved down here.

09:08.813 --> 09:10.846
Yep, about 3 to 4 months ago.

09:10.848 --> 09:12.381
And you moved down here with your son.

09:12.383 --> 09:14.049
- Yes.
- And how old is he?

09:14.051 --> 09:15.617
- He's 4.
- Okay.

09:15.619 --> 09:18.554
So, Abby, Emily told me that her
and her husband's relationship

09:18.556 --> 09:20.989
has kind of gone downhill
since moving here.

09:20.991 --> 09:22.758
Um, have you noticed that?

09:22.760 --> 09:24.193
- Yeah.
- You have.

09:24.195 --> 09:26.595
They're not happy
with each other right now.

09:26.597 --> 09:30.232
I noticed he snaps really quick,

09:30.234 --> 09:32.368
and he's said to me, "I
feel really irritated,

09:32.370 --> 09:34.670
and I don't know why."

09:34.672 --> 09:36.138
You've been here a few months.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.940
I know your sister's been
having a lot of activity

09:37.942 --> 09:40.109
since she moved in here.
What about yourself?

09:40.111 --> 09:42.144
Right. Well, I've had,

09:42.146 --> 09:45.214
just an overall feeling
of being watched.

09:45.216 --> 09:47.549
You feel like you're
being watched right now?

09:47.551 --> 09:49.551
Yeah. Like, I don't...

09:49.553 --> 09:52.321
Like there's someone else in the corner.

09:52.323 --> 09:55.424
Okay. Anything else?

09:55.426 --> 09:57.393
My son has been having nightmares.

09:57.395 --> 09:58.794
He's never had nightmares like he's had

09:58.796 --> 10:00.062
since we moved down here.

10:00.064 --> 10:01.663
He's described to me

10:01.665 --> 10:04.366
a bunch of vampires wearing capes...

10:04.368 --> 10:06.468
- Okay.
- With sharp teeth and red eyes.

10:06.470 --> 10:09.071
So what your son described in a dream

10:09.073 --> 10:13.208
to you is something that
Emily's niece said she saw.

10:13.210 --> 10:14.977
Yeah.

10:14.979 --> 10:16.912
I want to feel like I
made the right choice

10:16.914 --> 10:19.982
and didn't bring him into
somewhere that's not safe.

10:19.984 --> 10:21.350
'Cause I'm...

10:21.352 --> 10:25.154
I moved down here to make
a better life for him and I.

10:25.156 --> 10:26.855
Anything else going on?

10:26.857 --> 10:28.791
Um, I get panic attacks.

10:28.793 --> 10:29.892
Okay.

10:29.894 --> 10:32.528
And then, like, I can't breathe.

10:32.530 --> 10:34.630
Like I feel like I have
to take a deep breath.

10:34.632 --> 10:38.767
And then my heart will just
feel like it's going really fast,

10:38.769 --> 10:40.903
beating out of my chest almost.

10:40.905 --> 10:42.671
You have any other physical problems?

10:42.673 --> 10:46.542
Every once in a while, I get
a feeling of nauseousness,

10:46.544 --> 10:48.510
like, really sick to my stomach.

10:48.512 --> 10:52.781
But when I'm outside, I fell better.

10:52.783 --> 10:55.184
There's something...
There's something here.

10:57.922 --> 10:59.988
I can't tell what this
strange-looking creature

10:59.990 --> 11:02.991
is, possibly a demon.

11:02.993 --> 11:05.461
If anybody has any,

11:05.463 --> 11:09.598
predispositions to, say,

11:09.600 --> 11:12.801
being depressed or anxious or angry,

11:12.803 --> 11:16.038
it'll amplify that tenfold.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.041
Also, if they have any,

11:19.043 --> 11:22.511
existing illnesses,
it'll go in there

11:22.513 --> 11:27.616
and attack that and
make it 10 times worse.

11:27.618 --> 11:31.320
It can make someone very ill,

11:31.322 --> 11:33.689
whether mentally or physically.

11:37.027 --> 11:40.729
Somebody's sleepwalking, this man.

11:40.731 --> 11:42.397
Male.

11:42.399 --> 11:45.400
I think he's being
influenced by this thing.

11:45.402 --> 11:47.469
And then someone just yelled, "Murder!"

11:47.471 --> 11:49.271
Somebody keeps talking
about murder, murder,

11:49.273 --> 11:50.460
murder, murder, murder, murder, murder,

11:50.486 --> 11:51.465
murder, murder, murder, murder.

11:57.848 --> 11:59.348
So, Chris, I was talking to Emily.

11:59.350 --> 12:01.250
She was talking about the stuff
that's going on in the house.

12:01.252 --> 12:04.620
Um, she said your
personality has changed

12:04.622 --> 12:06.321
since the activity picked up.

12:06.323 --> 12:07.656
I mean, do you agree with that?

12:07.658 --> 12:10.292
Yeah, she says I'm a
little bit more edgy now.

12:10.294 --> 12:14.496
You know, I... I can
feel I get angry faster.

12:14.498 --> 12:16.465
- Are you concerned about it?
- Yeah.

12:16.467 --> 12:18.500
I mean, I... I want to go
back to the way we used to be.

12:18.502 --> 12:20.102
So do you believe
Emily when she tells you

12:20.104 --> 12:22.104
about all the experiences she's having?

12:22.106 --> 12:23.372
- I believe her.
- Okay.

12:23.374 --> 12:25.173
I wish I could see
something just at least once,

12:25.175 --> 12:27.609
just so I can know what her
and Eli are going through.

12:27.611 --> 12:29.378
You've had no experiences?

12:29.380 --> 12:30.712
There's a few things,

12:30.714 --> 12:33.382
but I'm not sure if
they're paranormal not

12:33.384 --> 12:35.050
Okay, so let's go through 'em.

12:35.052 --> 12:37.886
Okay. I... I hear the floor creaking.

12:37.888 --> 12:40.155
It sounds like somebody walking.

12:40.157 --> 12:41.823
Could it be somebody walking?

12:41.825 --> 12:44.726
Nah, if I'm home alone,
I'll still hear it.

12:44.728 --> 12:46.361
All right, so how do youla that?

12:46.363 --> 12:49.498
I don't know. I think
it might be the cat.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.133
Cat?

12:51.135 --> 12:52.968
What's the cat weigh?
Six pounds? I mean...

12:52.970 --> 12:55.837
Maybe. I don't really know what it is.

12:55.839 --> 12:57.606
All right. Is there anything
else that's going on with you?

12:57.608 --> 12:58.974
Yeah. Sometimes, you know,

12:58.976 --> 13:00.442
if I'm out in the garage working,

13:00.444 --> 13:02.044
I just kind of get this weird feeling

13:02.046 --> 13:04.079
somebody's staring at you.

13:04.081 --> 13:05.981
And how do you explain that one?

13:05.983 --> 13:07.950
I was told that the previous owner,

13:07.952 --> 13:10.619
he committed suicide.

13:10.621 --> 13:12.054
Okay, do you know how?

13:12.056 --> 13:13.989
I was told he shut the garage doors

13:13.991 --> 13:17.993
and, ran his lawnmower.

13:17.995 --> 13:19.928
That's something I'll
definitely look into.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.163
Anything else?

13:21.165 --> 13:22.564
I'm tired a lot.

13:22.566 --> 13:24.733
Is it while you're home
or while you're at work?

13:24.735 --> 13:26.768
Usually when I'm home.
Actually, when I leave,

13:26.770 --> 13:29.037
and I go to work, I
feel... I feel pretty good.

13:29.039 --> 13:30.672
Mold or anything like that in the house

13:30.674 --> 13:32.040
when you had it inspected?

13:32.042 --> 13:33.408
No.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.510
Well, it doesn't sound like
you're much of a skeptic.

13:35.512 --> 13:37.479
Maybe. I love my family.

13:37.481 --> 13:39.615
I'm gonna do whatever
I can to keep 'em safe.

13:39.617 --> 13:41.650
- Okay.
- That's why you're here.

13:45.489 --> 13:46.822
Got it.

13:46.824 --> 13:48.757
Okay, I think I know what's going on.

13:51.195 --> 13:55.163
Wow, this one was hard to figure out.

13:55.165 --> 13:57.766
- So what do think's happening?
- I'm pretty damn sure.

13:57.768 --> 13:59.601
There are Native Americans here

13:59.603 --> 14:02.771
who are not mentally sound.

14:02.773 --> 14:05.807
And I think, if a person,

14:05.809 --> 14:07.442
a living person, is in this area,

14:07.444 --> 14:09.678
they can form an attachment.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.179
Have they made this attachment?

14:11.181 --> 14:14.216
Yes. To a living male here.

14:14.218 --> 14:16.852
And I think these Native Americans,

14:16.854 --> 14:20.956
that they're acting like a demon

14:20.958 --> 14:24.626
and that they're influencing
a living male here

14:24.628 --> 14:29.264
to potentially,
kill his whole family.

14:29.266 --> 14:30.799
Why do they want to do that?

14:30.801 --> 14:33.201
They're just crazy.

14:49.721 --> 14:52.221
Look, I always ask homeowners
for leads on history.

14:52.223 --> 14:54.223
Half the time, they're useless.

14:54.225 --> 14:57.493
But in this case, turns out
the owner did die in the garage.

14:57.495 --> 14:59.295
I'm heading over to meet with his sons,

14:59.297 --> 15:02.098
who say they don't believe
his death was accidental.

15:08.806 --> 15:10.506
I know it's a touchy subject. Your dad

15:10.508 --> 15:12.441
passed away right here in this garage.

15:12.443 --> 15:15.211
Before we get to that, what
kind of a man was your father?

15:15.213 --> 15:18.481
He worked two jobs.
Mom stayed home with us.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.249
This is a picture of mom and dad,

15:20.251 --> 15:22.852
taken in '92.

15:22.854 --> 15:24.954
I know this is all
very hard to talk about,

15:24.956 --> 15:26.922
but I got a weird question
to ask both of you guys.

15:26.924 --> 15:31.527
Um, did mom and/or dad ever talk

15:31.529 --> 15:33.696
about anything strange
going on in the house

15:33.698 --> 15:36.432
that they couldn't explain?

15:36.434 --> 15:38.067
Dad said one time

15:38.069 --> 15:42.838
that he thought the house was haunted.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.974
I know your dad died in 2011.

15:44.976 --> 15:46.709
Is that right?

15:46.711 --> 15:48.644
Okay, is your mom still around?

15:48.646 --> 15:50.913
- She's passed away.
- When did she die?

15:50.915 --> 15:52.581
It's 2002.

15:52.583 --> 15:56.052
She had a stage 4 brain tumor,

15:56.054 --> 15:57.586
and she just got tired of fighting it.

15:57.588 --> 16:00.956
And she passed away
in the master bedroom.

16:00.958 --> 16:03.592
- How old was she at the time?
- 76, wasn't it?

16:03.594 --> 16:07.163
76, okay. How'd your father take that?

16:07.165 --> 16:11.701
I don't think he was that upset at all.

16:11.703 --> 16:13.536
- That's a little strange.
- Yeah.

16:13.538 --> 16:15.204
Sounds like you and your
father didn't get along.

16:15.206 --> 16:16.739
No, not at all.

16:16.741 --> 16:18.908
I tried for 20 years in the military

16:18.910 --> 16:23.012
to feel like he felt I
was worthy of something.

16:23.014 --> 16:25.181
And it never happened.

16:25.183 --> 16:27.850
All right. So what happened
after your mom passed?

16:27.852 --> 16:29.819
Within a week or so after Mom died,

16:29.821 --> 16:32.088
he had a couple girls living here.

16:32.090 --> 16:34.290
Wait a minute. How old was
your father again at this time?

16:34.292 --> 16:35.691
About 82.

16:35.693 --> 16:37.993
And how old were the two
women that moved in here.

16:37.995 --> 16:40.429
In their 30s.

16:40.431 --> 16:41.997
They was taking his money.

16:41.999 --> 16:44.934
He'd gone through at least $100,000.

16:44.936 --> 16:48.104
He pawned everything he had.

16:48.106 --> 16:50.740
Now, I know your dad died
right here in the garage.

16:50.742 --> 16:52.641
What was the official cause of death?

16:52.643 --> 16:54.810
Carbon monoxide toxicity.

16:54.812 --> 16:58.981
Here's a copy of the autopsy report.

16:58.983 --> 17:01.217
Where'd they say that was coming from?

17:01.219 --> 17:03.486
There was a lawnmower sitting
right here that was running.

17:03.488 --> 17:05.621
How old was your father at the time?

17:05.623 --> 17:07.455
- 86.
- Was he in bad health?

17:07.458 --> 17:10.159
- No.
- He could outdo me, no problem.

17:10.161 --> 17:11.660
What do you think happened?

17:11.662 --> 17:14.663
I think he was killed in
there and brought out here.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.699
- You think he was killed?
- Yeah.

17:16.701 --> 17:18.233
Do you agree with that, Kim?

17:18.236 --> 17:20.336
Yeah, I don't believe
he committed suicide.

17:20.338 --> 17:22.171
What happens to these two girls
that are living in the house?

17:22.173 --> 17:23.638
Were they ever questioned?

17:23.641 --> 17:25.406
No.

17:30.314 --> 17:32.181
Don't like it in here.

17:32.183 --> 17:34.683
I feel like death.
There's a lot of death.

17:38.589 --> 17:41.257
Like the ground is just ****

17:41.259 --> 17:42.491
Saturated with it.

17:42.493 --> 17:44.627
Feels very deep here.

17:46.831 --> 17:48.297
I feel a male.

17:48.299 --> 17:51.267
And I feel death and darkness.

17:51.269 --> 17:53.202
I feel, like, a loss of control.

17:53.204 --> 17:56.038
And I feel something around my neck.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.274
I feel like I'm being strangled.

18:02.246 --> 18:05.815
So far, I know of two deaths
on my client's property...

18:05.817 --> 18:09.185
one in the master bedroom,
the other in the garage.

18:09.187 --> 18:11.020
But I want to see if
there's anything more

18:11.022 --> 18:14.190
that could help my case.

18:14.192 --> 18:18.394
Searching through old records,
I find the Martin family.

18:18.396 --> 18:20.429
Turns out, they lost four
of their seven children

18:20.431 --> 18:22.364
while living on Emily and Chris' land.

18:26.070 --> 18:27.770
So I asked the local genealogist

18:27.772 --> 18:29.138
to look into these deaths for me.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.606
I'm meeting her at a small cemetery

18:30.608 --> 18:32.374
right near Emily and Chris' property,

18:32.376 --> 18:34.076
where she says she's
got something to show me

18:34.078 --> 18:35.644
that might help my case.

18:43.821 --> 18:45.955
So Kathryn, I appreciate you
helping me out with the case.

18:45.957 --> 18:47.323
But why'd you want to meet here?

18:47.325 --> 18:49.325
Well, this is where a lot of
the Martin family is buried.

18:49.327 --> 18:50.693
- Right here?
- Yes, sir.

18:50.695 --> 18:52.428
Okay.

18:52.430 --> 18:54.163
Before we get to the
deaths of these kids,

18:54.165 --> 18:55.731
um, what do we know about the family?

18:55.733 --> 19:00.202
John Graves Martin owned
this land from 1875 to 1927.

19:00.204 --> 19:02.371
Do you know how much
property they had here?

19:02.373 --> 19:05.975
Yeah, at its peak, the
Martins had 560 acres.

19:05.977 --> 19:08.210
So we know from the
census he lost four kids.

19:08.212 --> 19:09.745
- Yes.
- All right.

19:09.747 --> 19:11.113
So what were you able to find out?

19:11.115 --> 19:13.482
Well, unfortunately, not
much. During this time period,

19:13.484 --> 19:15.818
Tennessee didn't require
death certificates.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.687
- Okay.
- So what we do know is, by 1900,

19:18.689 --> 19:20.122
he'd lost two of the children.

19:20.124 --> 19:22.658
And by 1910, he lost the other two.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.293
Okay, do we know what they died from,

19:24.295 --> 19:25.928
how old, their names, stuff like that?

19:25.930 --> 19:28.831
We only know the name of one
of their daughters, named Era.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.467
And she passed away before 1910.

19:31.469 --> 19:33.736
So now there's three kids
left. What happened with them?

19:33.738 --> 19:35.604
Well, all of them grew
up to have families

19:35.606 --> 19:37.439
and lived here in Tennessee.

19:37.441 --> 19:40.009
Okay.

19:40.011 --> 19:41.977
The violent woman

19:41.979 --> 19:45.281
who attacked me is
following me wherever I go.

19:45.283 --> 19:47.516
She may hate that I'm
here, but I'm not leaving

19:47.518 --> 19:50.319
until I find out who she was in life.

19:50.321 --> 19:52.054
Can you describe
what she looks like?

19:52.056 --> 19:58.327
Seeing her young, she looks
like she could be from anytime

19:58.329 --> 20:01.030
from 1870 to, like, 1920.

20:01.032 --> 20:03.299
But when she shows
herself as an old lady,

20:03.301 --> 20:05.301
she's looking real recent.

20:09.774 --> 20:12.741
She's talking about
something about her father,

20:12.743 --> 20:17.079
'cause she's talking about
how her father was a good man.

20:17.081 --> 20:18.914
You know, I think her whole family got

20:18.916 --> 20:20.883
****.

20:20.885 --> 20:23.786
Something... Something bad.

20:23.788 --> 20:25.788
Some kind of vendetta.

20:25.790 --> 20:28.157
She is fixated on...

20:28.159 --> 20:30.025
on children.

20:30.027 --> 20:32.194
She's trying to protect
the living children

20:32.196 --> 20:35.197
from the male... the
living male in the house,

20:35.199 --> 20:38.067
because she, I believe,

20:38.069 --> 20:40.536
understands that there's an attachment

20:40.538 --> 20:44.039
that's influencing him to
potentially harm the children.

20:45.609 --> 20:47.543
This is really close
to my client's property.

20:47.545 --> 20:50.012
Indeed, this was part of
the original Martin farm.

20:50.014 --> 20:52.081
- Who owns it now?
- John Graves Martin

20:52.083 --> 20:55.384
sold this cemetery to
the city of Estill Springs

20:55.386 --> 20:57.419
in 1900 for $30,

20:57.421 --> 20:59.588
but there was a stipulation in the deed.

21:02.293 --> 21:06.729
He wrote in there that it
was for whites and no other.

21:06.731 --> 21:08.797
- Now, did that change?
- It did.

21:08.799 --> 21:12.101
Now it's a city cemetery,
so anyone can be buried here.

21:12.103 --> 21:14.770
There's more than 860 burials here.

21:14.772 --> 21:17.139
People are still being
buried here today.

21:21.278 --> 21:24.913
There's a lot of dead around,

21:24.915 --> 21:26.648
restless souls.

21:26.650 --> 21:28.751
How many?

21:28.753 --> 21:32.821
Thirty to 40, maybe, people?

21:32.823 --> 21:34.957
And this is all different
**** time periods.

21:34.959 --> 21:38.694
This is very, um, weird.

21:38.696 --> 21:42.398
Like, some are old,
you know, like, way old.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.634
Some of them, they're like recent

21:45.636 --> 21:48.170
and that they could do real harm.

21:48.172 --> 21:51.740
Something's not right
here. Something's not right.

21:58.649 --> 22:00.149
If you need us to investigate

22:00.151 --> 22:02.051
unexplained activity in your home,

22:02.053 --> 22:04.586
go to the Dead Files
page at travelchannel.com.

22:04.588 --> 22:06.488
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story.

22:06.490 --> 22:07.823
And we'll help if we can.

22:15.437 --> 22:18.038
You know, something else
caught my attention in research.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.841
A brutal case where a mob
tortured and killed a black man

22:20.843 --> 22:22.976
right near Emily and Chris' house.

22:22.978 --> 22:24.544
I'm heading over to meet
with a local professor

22:24.546 --> 22:26.346
who said it was one of
the most heinous crimes

22:26.348 --> 22:28.081
in the state's history.

22:34.957 --> 22:37.958
Doing my research, I came across
this lynching that took place,

22:37.960 --> 22:39.593
looks like, right by
my client's property.

22:39.595 --> 22:41.395
- What do
you know about it?

22:41.397 --> 22:44.264
This happens February 8th, 1918.

22:44.266 --> 22:47.033
Jim Mcllherron was an
African-American male

22:47.035 --> 22:48.368
walking down Main Street.

22:48.370 --> 22:50.270
And he's confronted by three white men.

22:50.272 --> 22:51.905
They start throwing rocks at him

22:51.907 --> 22:53.774
and throwing racial epithets at him.

22:53.776 --> 22:55.842
- What happens next?
- They pick on the wrong guy.

22:55.844 --> 22:57.778
Mcllherron is an expert marksman.

22:57.780 --> 22:59.780
He's armed. He pulls out his gun.

22:59.782 --> 23:01.381
He shoots six shots.

23:01.383 --> 23:03.784
When the dust clears,
two of the men are dead

23:03.786 --> 23:05.752
and one is, badly injured.

23:05.754 --> 23:07.354
I have a copy of the
two death certificates

23:07.356 --> 23:08.555
of the men who died.

23:08.557 --> 23:10.257
So he kills two
out of the three guys.

23:10.259 --> 23:12.459
Yes, sir.

23:12.461 --> 23:14.327
It's in broad daylight.

23:14.329 --> 23:16.029
He knows he has to get
out of town immediately.

23:16.031 --> 23:18.098
He goes about 40 miles,

23:18.100 --> 23:20.567
to a place called
McMinnville, a small town.

23:20.569 --> 23:23.103
And when word of this shooting happens,

23:23.105 --> 23:25.105
several hundred men

23:25.107 --> 23:27.541
start to create a mob to follow him.

23:27.543 --> 23:30.243
They collect dogs.
They find him in a barn.

23:30.245 --> 23:32.412
They surround
him. A shootout ensues.

23:32.414 --> 23:33.947
Hundreds of shots are fired.

23:33.949 --> 23:36.616
Mcllherron is shot in the eye,

23:36.618 --> 23:38.869
in the arm, and in the leg.

23:38.871 --> 23:42.172
Okay.

23:42.174 --> 23:44.908
Something bad happened.

23:44.910 --> 23:48.044
This was a long time
ago, during the day.

23:48.046 --> 23:50.780
Something bad happened. And it...

23:50.782 --> 23:55.552
And that set the stage for
all the **** up ****

23:55.554 --> 23:58.088
That has happened since
and is happening now.

24:01.026 --> 24:02.926
**** no. Hell no!

24:02.928 --> 24:04.227
What?

24:04.229 --> 24:05.929
Somebody... Okay, there's a lot

24:05.931 --> 24:08.231
of physical trauma going on here.

24:08.233 --> 24:12.369
People being shot or stabbed here.

24:12.371 --> 24:15.071
So does Mcllherron die
from the gunshot wounds?

24:15.073 --> 24:17.174
Nope. They put him back on a train

24:17.176 --> 24:19.709
and take him back to Estill Springs.

24:19.711 --> 24:22.179
When the train arrives,
about 1,500 people

24:22.181 --> 24:23.547
are there.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.215
They take him about a half a mile out.

24:25.217 --> 24:26.483
They make two fires.

24:26.485 --> 24:29.019
They tie him to a tree
and begin to torture him.

24:29.021 --> 24:30.453
What kind of torture we talking about?

24:30.455 --> 24:32.355
They poked him with red-hot irons

24:32.357 --> 24:34.858
and shoved it into
his... into his stomach.

24:34.860 --> 24:36.159
Okay.

24:36.161 --> 24:38.528
Took it out, burned
either side of his neck.

24:38.530 --> 24:41.164
They castrated him
before they burned him.

24:41.166 --> 24:42.699
This is not the same lynching,

24:42.701 --> 24:44.768
but this is the kind
of gruesome spectacle

24:44.770 --> 24:47.804
that we're talking about.

24:47.806 --> 24:49.539
Jesus.

24:49.541 --> 24:52.509
I've seen a lot of really bad things

24:52.511 --> 24:54.110
in my time on the police department.

24:54.112 --> 24:56.279
And I got to tell ya, this is...

24:56.281 --> 24:59.316
It... It's pretty messed up.

24:59.318 --> 25:01.318
Knowing the maps at the
time, this looks like

25:01.320 --> 25:04.020
this might have happened either
on or near my client's property.

25:04.022 --> 25:05.622
Does that sound right to you?

25:05.624 --> 25:06.790
Absolutely.

25:06.792 --> 25:08.892
Either right next to it,
or on the property itself.

25:08.894 --> 25:11.194
And I know the Martin
family owned it at the time.

25:11.196 --> 25:13.230
Would they have at least been there,

25:13.232 --> 25:14.731
or been involved in this lynching?

25:14.733 --> 25:16.066
Absolutely.

25:16.068 --> 25:17.701
If they weren't a part of it,
I'm sure they knew about it.

25:17.703 --> 25:19.436
More than likely, just about everybody

25:19.438 --> 25:22.072
in Estill Springs was a part of this.

25:22.074 --> 25:24.774
Was anybody ever convicted
for this lynching?

25:24.776 --> 25:26.109
No.

25:26.111 --> 25:27.911
In fact, the members of the
mob took souvenirs of his body.

25:27.913 --> 25:30.347
They took his ears, they took a finger.

25:30.349 --> 25:32.082
- For what?
- They displayed him

25:32.084 --> 25:33.750
in the local store.

25:33.752 --> 25:36.853
That's pretty sick.

25:36.855 --> 25:41.157
My, Achilles, got chopped.

25:41.159 --> 25:43.360
Um, something happened back here,

25:43.362 --> 25:44.928
like I got cut.

25:44.930 --> 25:47.297
So I'm gonna say there was,
like, an attack or some...

25:47.299 --> 25:49.899
something like this.

25:49.901 --> 25:53.770
See, and more I go back,
the more pain I'm feeling.

25:53.772 --> 25:55.538
My head hurts.

25:55.540 --> 25:57.340
Head hurts.

26:07.886 --> 26:10.920
I saw a lot of disturbing
activity on my walk.

26:10.922 --> 26:13.089
But the dead woman
attacking a living man

26:13.091 --> 26:15.158
had me the most concerned.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.827
She had really long hair.

26:17.829 --> 26:21.765
And she was wearing a dress.

26:21.767 --> 26:25.001
She can punch people.

26:25.003 --> 26:28.004
And I'd like to show,
like, a living man.

26:28.006 --> 26:30.907
And have her, like,
punch him in the stomach.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.613
Is this what you saw?

26:38.583 --> 26:40.450
Yes.

27:00.562 --> 27:03.463
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:03.465 --> 27:05.565
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:05.567 --> 27:08.334
and our clients for the first time.

27:08.336 --> 27:11.838
Amy, I'd like you to meet
Emily, her husband, Chris.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.540
And this her sister, Abby,

27:13.542 --> 27:15.208
who recently moved into their home

27:15.210 --> 27:16.876
with her
4- year-old son.

27:16.878 --> 27:18.545
The main reason we were called in

27:18.547 --> 27:20.380
is for this beautiful, young boy here.

27:20.382 --> 27:21.948
This is Eli.

27:21.950 --> 27:24.984
This is their son

27:24.986 --> 27:27.253
that they adopted from China last year.

27:27.255 --> 27:29.756
They wanted to give him a better life.

27:29.758 --> 27:31.658
But the activity's so bad in the house

27:31.660 --> 27:33.326
that Emily actually told me

27:33.328 --> 27:35.595
he'd probably be better
off back at that orphanage.

27:35.597 --> 27:38.298
It broke my heart when
she said that to me.

27:38.300 --> 27:40.433
I'm really hoping that you
can give us some answers

27:40.435 --> 27:42.402
and, help them out.

27:45.373 --> 27:49.142
This was one of the worst investigations

27:49.144 --> 27:50.977
I've ever done.

27:50.979 --> 27:54.247
And that's why we're
here in this barn tonight

27:54.249 --> 27:57.116
because there was no way in hell

27:57.118 --> 28:00.086
I was going back to your property.

28:00.088 --> 28:01.721
The first place

28:01.723 --> 28:05.725
that I got pulled to
was to the backyard.

28:05.727 --> 28:09.963
I walked over to the detached garage.

28:09.965 --> 28:13.833
And I had this overwhelming feeling

28:13.835 --> 28:17.370
of death and darkness in there.

28:17.372 --> 28:19.372
And it seemed like the ground

28:19.374 --> 28:22.141
was just kind of saturated with it.

28:22.143 --> 28:25.445
And I almost felt
like I was gonna vomit.

28:25.447 --> 28:27.447
Wow.

28:27.449 --> 28:30.717
There was some male.

28:30.719 --> 28:33.019
And I felt, like, a loss of control.

28:33.021 --> 28:36.356
And then I also felt like
something was around my neck.

28:36.358 --> 28:38.992
And I was being strangled.

28:38.994 --> 28:41.060
When I'm in the garage,
you get this feeling

28:41.062 --> 28:43.696
that somebody is kind of watching you.

28:43.698 --> 28:44.964
Now Chris is a skeptic.

28:44.966 --> 28:47.066
And he always tries to figure out

28:47.068 --> 28:48.768
that it's not paranormal.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.538
I'm a see-it-to-believe-it
person.

28:51.540 --> 28:53.439
Now, before Chris and
Emily owned the house,

28:53.441 --> 28:56.910
it was owned by Robert
Dawson and his wife, Barbara.

28:56.912 --> 28:59.345
Um, I got a photo of that couple.

28:59.347 --> 29:01.781
Now, Barbara passed away from cancer

29:01.783 --> 29:04.751
in the master bedroom in 2007.

29:04.753 --> 29:06.185
She had been sick for a while.

29:06.187 --> 29:07.620
What was kind of funny

29:07.622 --> 29:09.589
is Robert, according to his two sons,

29:09.591 --> 29:11.724
who I interviewed,

29:11.726 --> 29:13.660
didn't seem too broken up about it.

29:13.662 --> 29:15.828
Now, the guy was 82 at the time.

29:15.830 --> 29:17.530
And a week after his wife died,

29:17.532 --> 29:20.833
he had two women in their
30s move in with him.

29:20.835 --> 29:24.337
Now, they took advantage of
him, they took all his money.

29:24.339 --> 29:27.574
Now, 2011, he was found
dead in that garage,

29:27.576 --> 29:29.108
according to the autopsy protocol

29:29.110 --> 29:31.945
that I got right here.

29:31.947 --> 29:35.081
Official cause of death was
carbon monoxide poisoning.

29:35.083 --> 29:38.051
That makes sense to me,
that feeling of, like,

29:38.053 --> 29:41.287
darkness and despair and negativity.

29:41.289 --> 29:43.089
All that you feel in that garage

29:43.091 --> 29:46.292
that affects someone's personality?

29:46.294 --> 29:51.164
I think that a person
would feel weighted down,

29:51.166 --> 29:55.768
an agitation, tired, drained.

29:55.770 --> 29:57.804
I feel a lot of that,

29:57.806 --> 29:59.872
just not necessarily just the garage,

29:59.874 --> 30:01.341
but just being in...

30:01.343 --> 30:03.676
on the property, I guess you could say.

30:03.678 --> 30:07.180
When I leave, I actually
kind of feel better.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.784
What else did you see?

30:11.786 --> 30:16.756
One of the more powerful dead people

30:16.758 --> 30:18.157
on your property

30:18.159 --> 30:20.360
is the dead woman who I met outside.

30:20.362 --> 30:23.496
And she was just
screaming and freaking out,

30:23.498 --> 30:25.798
charging me like a maniac.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.001
I think the living
would possibly hear her

30:28.003 --> 30:32.205
when she's flipping out and
also see her as a shadow.

30:32.207 --> 30:35.108
The other thing I was
getting a lot with her

30:35.110 --> 30:37.910
and about her is her
fixation on children.

30:37.912 --> 30:40.780
And she also made it very clear

30:40.782 --> 30:44.884
that she does not like living adults.

30:44.886 --> 30:48.921
The biggest concern with her
is that she can be very violent,

30:48.923 --> 30:51.557
and unfortunately, physical.

30:51.559 --> 30:54.293
I found that out because
when I was getting ready

30:54.295 --> 30:56.029
to go into the house,

30:56.031 --> 30:58.731
she freaking

30:58.733 --> 31:01.234
jumped me and punched
me square in the stomach.

31:01.236 --> 31:04.203
Um, you're hitting on a lot

31:04.205 --> 31:06.005
of the things these
guys are experiencing.

31:06.007 --> 31:09.042
First off, um, you say
she's fixated on kids?

31:09.044 --> 31:10.877
- Yeah.
- Emily, do me a favor

31:10.879 --> 31:14.814
and tell Amy what you
see over Eli's crib.

31:14.816 --> 31:17.950
I saw a shadow
person, really tall.

31:17.952 --> 31:21.621
And it was just standing by
his bed looking down at him.

31:21.623 --> 31:23.222
He wakes up at night

31:23.224 --> 31:26.459
screaming and crying,
saying, "Scare me. Scare me."

31:26.461 --> 31:27.660
Tell Amy

31:27.662 --> 31:29.896
about the other shadow
figures you see, as well.

31:29.898 --> 31:32.165
I see 'em around my bed all the time.

31:32.167 --> 31:34.200
Couple times a week,
I wake up in the night

31:34.202 --> 31:35.702
seeing stuff.

31:35.704 --> 31:38.738
Do you ever hear any sounds or
anything while it's going on?

31:38.740 --> 31:40.306
A lot of the times, I'll be home alone,

31:40.308 --> 31:42.108
sitting there watching TV.

31:42.110 --> 31:44.243
And, you know, I'll hear
stuff throughout the house.

31:44.245 --> 31:46.679
And I just think it's
the dog or a cat or...

31:46.681 --> 31:48.247
Something.

31:48.249 --> 31:50.149
Now, is that this woman doing all this?

31:50.151 --> 31:54.220
It could be her. I
mean, she's got issues.

31:54.222 --> 31:59.025
The person that she said
she really dislikes the most,

31:59.027 --> 32:00.793
as far as living people in the house,

32:00.795 --> 32:03.830
is the male in the house.

32:03.832 --> 32:06.299
And she really has it out for him.

32:06.301 --> 32:10.069
And I had a sketch done

32:10.071 --> 32:13.439
of what she would like to do to him.

32:25.053 --> 32:27.954
This is what this person
wants to do to you, apparently.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.196
So she just wants to take me out?

32:37.198 --> 32:39.165
Yeah.

32:39.167 --> 32:41.868
Can she?

32:41.870 --> 32:44.036
Yes.

32:44.038 --> 32:45.972
Chris, did you think
tonight you'd be a target

32:45.974 --> 32:47.373
when we sat down?

32:47.375 --> 32:49.842
I didn't think I really
had much to do with it

32:49.844 --> 32:51.344
at all, to be honest with you.

32:51.346 --> 32:54.580
I'm here to help her.
I'm here to support her.

32:54.582 --> 32:57.550
Looks like you may need the support.

32:57.552 --> 33:00.586
Kind of looking that way.

33:00.588 --> 33:03.189
You have any idea who
this crazy, old bat is?

33:03.191 --> 33:08.928
The few things that I was
able to extract from her were

33:08.930 --> 33:11.364
she can look a couple of different ways.

33:11.366 --> 33:13.499
When she showed herself
as being younger,

33:13.501 --> 33:15.101
it looked like she could be from, like,

33:15.103 --> 33:17.203
1870 to 1920.

33:17.205 --> 33:21.974
But then, when she
showed me herself older,

33:21.976 --> 33:25.111
it seemed extremely current.

33:25.113 --> 33:27.480
She was obsessed with her father.

33:27.482 --> 33:29.849
And she kept saying that
her father was a good man

33:29.851 --> 33:33.152
and her whole family had gotten screwed.

33:33.154 --> 33:37.256
The other thing that I got was
the connection with children,

33:37.258 --> 33:39.992
and that kids were
extremely important to her

33:39.994 --> 33:41.761
when she was alive.

33:41.763 --> 33:44.897
And they're still
important to her in death.

33:44.899 --> 33:48.267
Even though she may be scaring children,

33:48.269 --> 33:52.705
she's actually trying to protect them.

33:52.707 --> 33:55.541
So I'm just going off
the dates you gave me.

33:55.543 --> 33:57.443
There are a couple of women
who lived on the property

33:57.445 --> 33:59.345
that might fit the bill.

33:59.347 --> 34:00.980
Now, back in the late 1800s,

34:00.982 --> 34:04.150
this house sat in the
middle of a 560-acre farm.

34:04.152 --> 34:07.353
The guy who owned it was
named John Graves Martin.

34:07.355 --> 34:08.987
Well, he had seven
children. Out of the seven,

34:08.989 --> 34:12.491
four died at a very young age.

34:12.493 --> 34:15.995
Three of his kids survived,
and two of them were daughters.

34:15.996 --> 34:17.663
The one that makes the most sense,

34:17.665 --> 34:19.632
based on what you told
me, is Edna Martin.

34:19.634 --> 34:22.902
Now, she was born in
1895, grew up on the land.

34:22.904 --> 34:24.804
And she died in 1986.

34:24.806 --> 34:26.772
The other thing is you mentioned

34:26.774 --> 34:29.342
her being protective of the father.

34:29.344 --> 34:31.944
John Graves Martin built a
cemetery right on the property.

34:31.946 --> 34:33.512
But when he sold it to the city,

34:33.514 --> 34:36.882
he said it had to be for whites only.

34:36.885 --> 34:38.818
To me, it feels like Edna.

34:38.820 --> 34:41.387
Like, looking back at this whole thing,

34:41.389 --> 34:44.757
I almost feel like the
punch in the stomach was...

34:44.759 --> 34:46.893
was a second warning.

34:46.895 --> 34:49.027
Warning for what?

34:49.030 --> 34:51.630
To **** leave.

34:54.502 --> 34:56.636
When I walked through the door,

34:56.638 --> 34:59.272
I'm hearing this, like, growling.

34:59.274 --> 35:02.141
And it just sounded like
what you would imagine, like,

35:02.143 --> 35:06.946
a demon voice to sound like.

35:06.948 --> 35:10.249
The other thing was how
it was projecting itself.

35:10.251 --> 35:12.118
And what it looked like was,

35:12.120 --> 35:15.788
like, it had these long arms.

35:15.790 --> 35:18.991
And then it had, like,
this human, deformed head.

35:18.993 --> 35:22.094
My sister's daughter,

35:22.096 --> 35:28.100
she woke up to a black,
hooded figure with red eyes.

35:28.102 --> 35:31.871
Abby's son had a dream just like that.

35:31.873 --> 35:34.040
He said that there was a bunch of

35:34.042 --> 35:36.509
vampire-type people standing
in a group with capes.

35:36.511 --> 35:38.177
And they kept just staring at him.

35:38.179 --> 35:39.745
And he woke up.

35:39.747 --> 35:42.848
So is this something that
Chris' niece might have seen?

35:42.850 --> 35:45.818
Yes.

35:45.820 --> 35:47.620
It took me a while to figure out,

35:47.622 --> 35:49.288
but then it finally hit me.

35:49.290 --> 35:51.023
This thing is not a demon.

35:51.025 --> 35:54.560
It's dead Native Americans
who are mentally ill.

35:54.562 --> 35:56.095
And they are projecting themselves

35:56.097 --> 35:58.064
as a demon to scare you.

36:00.468 --> 36:02.735
They can focus in on people's weaknesses

36:02.737 --> 36:05.438
very quickly and easily.

36:05.440 --> 36:08.007
And so someone has a predisposition

36:08.009 --> 36:11.177
to being depressed, anxious, angry,

36:11.179 --> 36:14.780
they will draw that out
and amplify it tenfold.

36:14.782 --> 36:16.282
I woke up in the middle of the night,

36:16.284 --> 36:19.418
just that bad, heavy chest feeling.

36:19.420 --> 36:20.987
Can't breathe.

36:20.989 --> 36:23.089
And I constantly...
It seems to be actually

36:23.091 --> 36:24.824
getting worse over the
past couple of weeks.

36:24.826 --> 36:28.060
Yeah, like, I can't even
get out of bed some days.

36:28.062 --> 36:31.397
We aggravate each
other, and it's nonstop.

36:33.167 --> 36:34.800
What... What the hell do they want?

36:34.802 --> 36:37.370
You know, they definitely
keyed in on, you know,

36:37.372 --> 36:39.839
the male of the house.

36:39.841 --> 36:43.676
I saw this thing form
attachments to this male.

36:43.678 --> 36:47.546
And they've already
attached themselves to you.

36:47.548 --> 36:49.448
Whoa.

36:49.450 --> 36:52.618
Slight things could be
headaches, sleeplessness.

36:52.620 --> 36:55.354
There might be some
sleepwalking incidents.

36:55.356 --> 36:58.357
I'm a sleepwalker.

36:58.359 --> 37:00.960
Other people might see the behaviors

37:00.962 --> 37:04.563
more than the individual
who's being directly affected.

37:04.565 --> 37:06.899
And things that they
would notice might be

37:06.901 --> 37:09.068
abnormal aggressive behavior
that doesn't make sense

37:09.070 --> 37:10.870
for that individual.

37:10.872 --> 37:13.205
Yeah. I mean, he's a different person.

37:13.207 --> 37:15.408
- The snapping, real...
- Yeah.

37:15.410 --> 37:17.109
You know, just snaps real quick.

37:17.111 --> 37:19.111
He never used to do that, ever.

37:19.113 --> 37:22.782
The problem is is that
this attachment obviously

37:22.784 --> 37:25.551
can be extremely dangerous.

37:25.553 --> 37:29.088
And the thing that I did get, um,

37:29.090 --> 37:32.591
was that their ultimate goal would be

37:32.593 --> 37:37.296
for this individual to harm
and/or kill the entire family.

37:41.269 --> 37:42.968
All right. So
let me get this straight.

37:42.970 --> 37:44.737
You're saying that whatever's there

37:44.739 --> 37:47.573
is trying to influence
him to kill his family?

37:47.575 --> 37:49.308
Absolutely.

37:51.946 --> 37:55.214
I'm extremely frightened
for you and your family.

38:11.157 --> 38:13.091
So, Chris, I got to be honest.

38:13.093 --> 38:16.527
You had so few experiences
and seemed like such a skeptic,

38:16.529 --> 38:19.230
I almost thought about
leaving you out of the review.

38:19.232 --> 38:21.232
But now we have to figure out

38:21.234 --> 38:24.235
how to save not only you,

38:24.237 --> 38:26.437
but your beautiful family.

38:26.439 --> 38:28.773
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

38:31.711 --> 38:34.078
So there's a deceased female

38:34.080 --> 38:38.316
at the location who might be Edna,

38:38.318 --> 38:40.985
who is unstable.

38:40.987 --> 38:43.688
And she's coming after
you because she's afraid

38:43.690 --> 38:46.491
you're going to hurt the kids.

38:46.493 --> 38:51.696
And then you have the
unstable Native Americans

38:51.698 --> 38:53.965
who are targeting your family

38:53.967 --> 38:57.001
to, essentially, be exterminated.

39:00.173 --> 39:03.474
Here are the things that can be done.

39:03.476 --> 39:07.812
The first thing is the
garage needs to be cleansed.

39:07.814 --> 39:11.716
That should remove all of that residual

39:11.718 --> 39:13.885
negative darkness that,

39:13.887 --> 39:19.123
unfortunately, is surrounding
the male's demise there.

39:19.125 --> 39:22.060
After that, I want her gone.

39:22.062 --> 39:24.429
So what I would like to see with her

39:24.431 --> 39:27.265
would be a male medium brought in

39:27.267 --> 39:31.936
who has a very authoritative
kind of presence.

39:31.938 --> 39:35.273
And that individual should
come and move her on.

39:35.275 --> 39:36.974
This might take a couple of visits

39:36.976 --> 39:40.378
just because she is wicked.

39:40.380 --> 39:43.247
Now, with the Native Americans,

39:43.249 --> 39:46.084
a team of people need to come in.

39:46.086 --> 39:50.154
You need a Cherokee Native
American medicine person

39:50.156 --> 39:54.125
or shaman who needs
to perform a clearing

39:54.127 --> 39:56.461
and removal ritual.

39:56.463 --> 39:58.763
At the same time, a religious person,

39:58.765 --> 40:00.164
such as a priest,

40:00.166 --> 40:02.567
needs to be brought in
who performs an exorcism

40:02.569 --> 40:05.436
of the land...

40:05.438 --> 40:08.039
the house, and of you.

40:10.176 --> 40:14.045
Once all of this has been done,
you will know within the week

40:14.047 --> 40:17.215
if it has been successful or not.

40:17.217 --> 40:19.917
If we do all this stuff,
and it doesn't work...

40:19.919 --> 40:22.186
You just get the **** in your car,

40:22.188 --> 40:24.188
and you leave.

40:24.190 --> 40:27.525
I don't want to go home.

40:27.527 --> 40:32.163
I'm just really nervous,
anxious, worried.

40:32.165 --> 40:33.564
I'm scared.

40:33.566 --> 40:36.033
I mean, I knew it was bad.

40:36.035 --> 40:38.769
I just didn't think
it was to that extreme.

40:38.771 --> 40:40.738
So what would happen if we didn't do

40:40.740 --> 40:42.607
any of that stuff you said? We just...

40:42.609 --> 40:44.108
You would end up killing your family.

40:47.514 --> 40:49.680
You gonna do this exorcism thing?

40:49.682 --> 40:51.782
Or you gonna say BS on it?

40:51.784 --> 40:54.519
I'm willing to try.

40:54.521 --> 40:55.987
Well, no, no. It's not "willing to try."

40:55.989 --> 40:57.421
You're either gonna
do it, or you're not.

40:57.423 --> 40:58.856
There's no in between here.

40:58.858 --> 41:00.691
I mean, if it'll make me feel better.

41:00.693 --> 41:02.360
It's not a matter of feeling better.

41:02.362 --> 41:04.362
She's telling you, "If
you don't get this done,

41:04.364 --> 41:06.864
you're gonna do harm
to your own family."

41:06.866 --> 41:09.634
So, Chris, you gonna
have this exorcism done?

41:09.636 --> 41:11.669
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:11.671 --> 41:14.705
Well, do I have to even ask you
if you're gonna do this stuff?

41:14.707 --> 41:16.641
I'm definitely doing it.

41:16.643 --> 41:18.176
I'll do whatever it takes.

41:18.178 --> 41:21.812
It's crazy to me to think...

41:21.814 --> 41:24.282
that this is happening to me.

41:24.284 --> 41:25.983
It's just hard to say, "No,"

41:25.985 --> 41:28.186
when everything you said is so right.

41:30.790 --> 41:33.524
The only way Chris can
save himself and his family

41:33.526 --> 41:36.594
is to bring in a priest
to perform an exorcism.

41:36.596 --> 41:39.630
If that works, a medium
and a team of shaman

41:39.632 --> 41:41.598
can clear out the rest of the dead,

41:41.623 --> 41:45.359
and his family will finally be
able to live a peaceful life.
