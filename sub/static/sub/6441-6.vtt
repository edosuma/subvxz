00:23.256 --> 00:26.054
Okay, take five. Kent and Turner,
you're in the final.

00:26.659 --> 00:30.026
Dude, I'd definitely take
you in a rematch.

00:30.196 --> 00:33.165
My foot slipped on the dive,
ruined my rhythm.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.699
It's funny, I thought you
were just slow.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.933
He's a hottie, isn't he?

00:40.640 --> 00:42.005
Look at him.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.867
- Who, Clark?
- Oh, come on, Lana.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.446
- Krissy, Clark and I are just friends.
- Right.

00:52.185 --> 00:54.745
- So, what do you think?
- Awesome.

00:54.921 --> 00:58.118
I'll ask the principal
if we can hang it in the cafeteria.

00:58.291 --> 01:01.556
You've really thrown yourself
into Spirit Week. I'm impressed.

01:01.728 --> 01:05.858
Well, these are the best times of our lives.
Isn't that what they say?

01:06.299 --> 01:09.063
To be honest, I'd forgotten
how much fun this can be.

01:09.235 --> 01:12.136
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Krissy. Hey, baby.

01:12.505 --> 01:16.134
Hey, Troy, you're dripping
on my signs.

01:16.309 --> 01:20.473
- Don't you have another race?
- Finals. I need a good-luck kiss.

01:21.981 --> 01:25.576
- Go. I can finish up here.
- Thanks. Follow me.

01:26.953 --> 01:28.750
Not a problem.

01:36.329 --> 01:39.730
All right, this one's for bragging rights.
Fastest in the school.

01:39.899 --> 01:42.299
Okay, guys, on the blocks.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.628
Come on, Troy, hurry up.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.209
Swimmers, take your marks.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.107
Three, two, one!

02:06.893 --> 02:08.793
Troy?

02:09.128 --> 02:11.427
- Hey, hey! Troy!
- What's wrong with him?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.268
He's going under!

02:18.104 --> 02:20.004
Somebody help him!

02:20.173 --> 02:22.437
- Troy!
- Help him!

03:45.958 --> 03:47.892
Open your mouth.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.125
Hey, that's perfect.

03:52.298 --> 03:55.961
All we have to do is come up with
a snappy name, we'll make a fortune.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.535
Forget Mrs. Fields.
You could be "Mrs. Kents."

03:58.704 --> 04:02.936
- I like the sound of that.
- This is turning into a bigtime operation.

04:03.109 --> 04:05.373
Thanks. I've added
two convenience stores...

04:05.545 --> 04:08.173
...and the retirement center
to my client list.

04:08.347 --> 04:10.110
That's great.

04:10.349 --> 04:12.146
What?

04:12.318 --> 04:15.151
I don't see how we'll pay
the feed bill this month.

04:15.621 --> 04:20.115
- I could get an extension on our credit.
- We're already three months behind.

04:20.293 --> 04:23.660
- Henry's a friend, he'll understand.
- He already said no.

04:23.829 --> 04:26.957
My salary from Lionel isn't enough.
What are we gonna do?

04:36.008 --> 04:38.476
Maybe we should talk to my father.

04:43.015 --> 04:45.415
Why is it whenever anyone
mentions Granddad...

04:45.585 --> 04:48.577
...everyone becomes quiet
and uncomfortable?

04:48.754 --> 04:51.780
- Isn't it weird I've never met the guy?
- Clark, I'm...

04:51.958 --> 04:56.088
I'm sorry that you haven't had a relationship
with your grandpa, I really am.

04:56.262 --> 04:58.457
But there's too much bad blood.

04:59.932 --> 05:03.299
I'm sorry, but I've got work to do.

05:12.211 --> 05:16.614
- Lana, where would you like these?
- You can just put them on the counter.

05:16.782 --> 05:19.478
- Getting ready for the Spirit Week bash?
- Trying to.

05:19.652 --> 05:24.680
I think Nell's used the projection booth
as her personal storage since the late '70s.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.956
What are those?

05:34.133 --> 05:37.227
Clark, these photos are
of my mom and some guy.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.870
Maybe he's an old boyfriend.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.209
They were taken when
my parents were married.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.472
Maybe he was just a friend.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.148
- I'm sure you're right.
- Right about what?

05:56.322 --> 05:58.483
The mystery man with Lana's mother.

05:58.658 --> 06:01.559
Hey, they make an attractive couple.

06:05.464 --> 06:09.161
And there could be a million explanations.
Who do you think it is?

06:10.269 --> 06:12.328
I don't know,
but I'll bet Nell does.

06:12.505 --> 06:16.373
Then mystery solved.
I wish they were all this easy.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.136
Well, it's late, we should
get to school.

06:19.311 --> 06:23.441
- I'm heading that way, if you need a lift.
- I've got the first two periods off.

06:23.616 --> 06:27.279
- Clark?
- No, I was just gonna run.

06:28.254 --> 06:31.018
I don't think you could outrun
my Porsche, Clark.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.495
Excuse me. What's going on?
I need to get in there.

06:43.669 --> 06:47.537
- You should've been here earlier, Mr...?
- Kent. Clark Kent.

06:47.707 --> 06:51.871
Of course. I noticed in your records
you have a penchant for tardiness.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.841
- Who exactly are you?
- I'm Mr. Reynolds, your new principal.

06:56.315 --> 06:59.148
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Yes.

06:59.318 --> 07:00.876
So you're aware,
from now on...

07:01.053 --> 07:05.490
...this gate locks when the bell rings
and doesn't open until school is out.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.148
I'd...

07:07.827 --> 07:11.820
I'd appreciate it if you'd give Clark
a pass. He was late because of me.

07:11.997 --> 07:13.589
Lex Luthor.

07:13.766 --> 07:18.169
The Porsche, the attitude. Somehow
I'm not surprised you're involved.

07:18.337 --> 07:21.101
- You know each other.
- Mr. Reynolds was headmaster...

07:21.273 --> 07:23.673
...at Excelsior Prep
during my stay there.

07:23.843 --> 07:26.073
You might find this hard
to believe, Lex...

07:26.245 --> 07:29.703
...but people should take responsibility
for their own actions.

07:29.882 --> 07:33.079
- It won't happen again.
- I'm keeping my eye on you, Mr. Kent.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.248
The next time it happens,
automatic detention.

07:39.325 --> 07:40.587
Catch you later, Clark.

07:45.765 --> 07:50.668
Spare the rod, spoil the child. You haven't
changed. What's next, school uniforms?

07:50.936 --> 07:55.168
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay away
from my school and my students, Luthor.

07:55.341 --> 07:59.607
Listen, I know we had our share
of run-ins at Excelsior, but I was 14.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.543
Don't you think it's petty to be
holding a grudge?

08:02.715 --> 08:05.411
That's awfully noble,
coming from a Luthor.

08:06.452 --> 08:07.976
I'm a little confused.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.748
Exactly what did I do
to earn such enmity?

08:13.292 --> 08:15.157
Goodbye, Lex.

08:27.072 --> 08:29.165
Kristine Parker?

08:34.380 --> 08:37.543
- I'm Principal Reynolds.
- Hi, nice to finally meet you.

08:37.716 --> 08:41.914
- Did you get my memo about the uniforms?
- I did. Thank you, I'm looking into it.

08:42.087 --> 08:45.648
I understand you're the visionary
behind our Spirit Week activities.

08:45.825 --> 08:48.623
Well, I just want everyone
to have the best time ever.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.853
I admire your enthusiasm.

08:51.030 --> 08:55.160
I was going through the student files,
trying to get to know everyone better...

08:55.334 --> 08:59.395
...and I noticed we don't have
the transcripts from your last school.

08:59.572 --> 09:03.599
That's weird. But it figures,
my guidance counselor was a total ditz.

09:03.776 --> 09:07.439
We need a copy on file. If you can
have your parents forward it...

09:07.613 --> 09:11.447
...I'd appreciate it.
- No problem, I'll tell them tonight.

09:20.459 --> 09:24.361
I see Troy's death has joined the ranks
of the unexplained and bizarre.

09:24.530 --> 09:30.162
Big time. The report said he died of an
onset of a rapid aging disease, progeria. Hi.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.362
I thought that made you age
over 10 years, not 10 seconds.

09:33.539 --> 09:38.203
Exactly. The coroner's running a test
to tell whether Troy had progeria, or...

09:38.377 --> 09:40.242
Something unexplained and bizarre.

09:40.412 --> 09:45.440
Good luck investigating. You'll probably
need a hall pass from our new principal.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.086
A lot of schools have
a closed-campus policy.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.616
- Why you so worked up?
- I had a run-in with him.

09:51.790 --> 09:55.021
He busted me for being late.
Threatened to keep his eye on me.

09:55.194 --> 09:58.857
Clark's on the principal's bad boy list.
First time for everything.

09:59.031 --> 10:00.726
- Guy's a real hard case.
- Right.

10:00.900 --> 10:04.461
First, it's a lock-down, next thing you know
he'll be burning books.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.696
Wait till he comes after The Torch.

10:06.872 --> 10:11.935
I did some digging on our Principal Reynolds
to find out his views on the fourth estate.

10:12.544 --> 10:15.035
Harvard, B.A.
Ph.D. At Columbia in education.

10:15.547 --> 10:20.177
Taught at prep schools all over Europe and
the East Coast. Pretty impressive resume.

10:20.352 --> 10:24.379
His name was mentioned as the new head
of the Metropolis Board of Education.

10:24.556 --> 10:27.650
Till one day he's dismissed
from Excelsior Prep...

10:27.826 --> 10:29.885
...and he doesn't work
again until here.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.860
How does a guy on the fast track
end up in Smallville?

10:33.032 --> 10:35.592
I don't know, but he's not
Wall of Weird material.

10:36.001 --> 10:40.438
Just because the guy doesn't love you
like every other teacher in this school...

10:40.606 --> 10:43.939
...doesn't mean that he's hiding
some dark past.

10:51.483 --> 10:53.747
Hey. Came by to see if
you needed a hand.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.444
Thought you were helping
your mom this afternoon.

10:56.622 --> 11:00.149
- She said she's got it covered.
- Something wrong?

11:00.326 --> 11:02.692
My mom's been secretive
the last couple days.

11:02.861 --> 11:05.352
A Kent secretive, that's shocking.

11:05.531 --> 11:08.864
- It has to do with my grandfather.
- You've never mentioned him.

11:09.034 --> 11:12.231
I've never actually met him.
I've only seen old pictures.

11:12.404 --> 11:16.340
- Do you know anything about him?
- He was a corporate lawyer in Metropolis.

11:16.508 --> 11:19.602
He and my grandmother
retired to Coast City.

11:20.012 --> 11:23.607
When I was in sixth grade,
I decided to call him. I left messages...

11:23.782 --> 11:27.115
...but he never called back.
Guess he wasn't interested.

11:27.286 --> 11:30.847
All these years I had this image
of the Kents as the perfect family.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.117
I guess we're just as dysfunctional
as everyone else.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.485
I never did pressure my parents
for the story.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.392
Maybe you didn't want to know.

11:39.798 --> 11:42.824
Maybe it's easier to live
with the image than the truth.

11:43.002 --> 11:47.098
Looks like we're both dealing
with secrets out of the past.

11:47.539 --> 11:51.669
I'm not sure what I'm gonna do, but this
is your chance to get some answers.

11:56.749 --> 11:59.149
I'll catch up with you later?

12:02.921 --> 12:07.620
Lana, the place looks fantastic.

12:08.694 --> 12:12.255
- You've done a really good job here.
- Thanks.

12:13.098 --> 12:16.590
- I wanted to talk to you about something.
- Yeah, what is it?

12:18.971 --> 12:21.201
These pictures.

12:24.510 --> 12:25.875
Do you know who he is?

12:26.245 --> 12:29.112
Must have been one of your mom's
old boyfriends.

12:29.281 --> 12:32.273
They were taken after Mom and Dad
were already married.

12:32.451 --> 12:35.147
Just a year before I was born.

12:37.322 --> 12:39.222
Lana, what's this about?

12:40.225 --> 12:41.487
I'm not sure.

12:42.594 --> 12:44.357
Listen to me.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.088
Your mother...

12:47.566 --> 12:52.196
She loved you and your father more
than anything else in this world.

12:53.038 --> 12:56.974
She never would have done anything
to hurt either of you.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.444
You know that, don't you?

13:25.771 --> 13:27.398
Hi, Dad.

13:27.573 --> 13:29.700
I appreciate you making the trip.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.813
I was surprised to get
your message.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.781
Must have taken a lot for Jonathan
to ask for my help.

13:40.953 --> 13:45.253
Jonathan is at the co-op in Granville.
He doesn't know I called.

13:46.191 --> 13:48.022
I should have known.

13:50.295 --> 13:52.889
I imagined this place differently.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.767
But it's not the life I wanted
for you, Martha.

13:56.935 --> 13:59.961
I'm happy, Dad. It's a good life.

14:00.139 --> 14:04.269
For some people, maybe.
But you had so much potential.

14:04.443 --> 14:09.403
Top 10 in your class. You could have gone
to any law school you wanted.

14:09.581 --> 14:11.674
I had hoped you'd take over
my practice.

14:11.850 --> 14:15.251
I never wanted to be a lawyer.
This is the life I chose.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.888
This is the life Jonathan
chose for you.

14:18.056 --> 14:21.457
- You just went along for the ride.
- This isn't about Jonathan.

14:21.627 --> 14:25.461
You raised an independent daughter.
You're angry because you got that.

14:25.631 --> 14:30.625
Here you are, 20 years later, going behind
your husband's back asking me for money.

14:30.802 --> 14:33.737
- Mom?
- Clark.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.106
I thought you were at the Talon.

14:36.608 --> 14:39.168
I finished early. What's up?

14:41.813 --> 14:44.008
Clark, this is your grandfather.

14:47.252 --> 14:50.415
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- Hello, Clark.

14:56.361 --> 14:57.794
I'II...

14:57.963 --> 14:59.794
I'll be at the motel.

15:00.766 --> 15:04.031
I'll have a cashier's check drawn
tomorrow morning.

15:04.203 --> 15:08.003
Why don't you stay with us?
We have plenty of room.

15:09.741 --> 15:12.767
I don't think that would be
a very good idea, Clark.

15:14.112 --> 15:16.444
Well, how about dinner?

15:17.449 --> 15:19.474
One meal as a family.

15:19.651 --> 15:21.676
I'm sorry.

15:42.407 --> 15:46.309
I don't want your father having anything
to do with our finances.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.412
Jonathan, what was I supposed to do?

15:48.580 --> 15:52.482
- Wait until the bank foreclosed?
- I wish you'd said something to me first.

15:52.651 --> 15:56.417
- What's the harm in hearing him out?
- You don't have to be the mediator.

15:56.588 --> 15:59.648
- I wish things could be different.
- Why can't they be?

15:59.825 --> 16:04.353
You told me to look for the best in people.
Maybe he's trying to put this behind him.

16:04.529 --> 16:06.827
I seriously doubt that, Clark.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.661
What happened that was
so bad?

16:09.835 --> 16:13.066
It can't be any worse than
what's in the storm cellar.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.604
Or can it?

16:18.644 --> 16:23.274
When your mother and I decided to get
married, I went to him to ask for her hand.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.777
- What'd he say?
- I remember his exact words:

16:26.985 --> 16:30.978
"I will not let my daughter throw her life
away by marrying a hick farmer...

16:31.156 --> 16:33.818
...that couldn't possibly
support her."

16:34.092 --> 16:37.687
- Well, that's harsh.
- That's the way he dealt with people.

16:37.963 --> 16:42.332
When he realized we were serious
about getting married, he lost it.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.561
- He tried to shove me out of his office.
- What happened?

16:48.407 --> 16:50.602
I hit him.

16:53.545 --> 16:56.275
I'm not proud of that,
I tried to apologize to him.

16:56.448 --> 17:00.009
He wouldn't have anything to do
with it. Your grandfather and I...

17:00.185 --> 17:03.814
...haven't said a word to each other since.
- That was 20 years ago.

17:03.989 --> 17:07.390
He was willing to drive out here,
maybe he wants to try again.

17:07.559 --> 17:11.757
Believe me, Clark, he's not here to help.
He's here to gloat.

17:34.486 --> 17:39.185
Hey, I got a message you wanted
to see me. Everything all right?

17:39.358 --> 17:41.588
I was wondering if you could
do me a favor.

17:41.860 --> 17:45.125
I take it Nell couldn't identify
the mystery man?

17:45.497 --> 17:47.829
If she could, she wouldn't
tell me anything.

17:47.999 --> 17:49.591
I wanna know who it is.

17:50.268 --> 17:52.532
Well, that shouldn't be
hard to find.

17:52.704 --> 17:56.333
But coming to terms with it could prove
to be more complicated.

17:56.508 --> 17:57.975
What do you mean?

17:58.143 --> 18:00.270
Come on, you know the story
of Pandora.

18:00.445 --> 18:03.539
She was given a box by Zeus
and warned never to open it.

18:03.715 --> 18:07.116
- She couldn't resist the temptation.
- I'm not afraid of the truth.

18:07.285 --> 18:11.187
Neither was Pandora. But once the box
was open, it could never be closed.

18:11.356 --> 18:13.916
All the misery could
never be put back.

18:14.092 --> 18:18.051
I appreciate the warning.
And anything you can tell me.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.458
Go, Crows!

18:25.570 --> 18:26.901
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey, Clark.

18:27.072 --> 18:30.132
Clark, you might want to disappear
for the next hour or so.

18:30.308 --> 18:32.299
- Why's that?
- I'm about to interview...

18:32.477 --> 18:35.037
...your new best friend,
Principal Reynolds.

18:35.213 --> 18:37.579
Thanks for the heads up.

18:40.652 --> 18:43.086
- What have you got there?
- Remember my buddy...

18:43.255 --> 18:47.385
...that works at the M.E.'s office?
- The guy with the black fingernail polish.

18:47.559 --> 18:51.928
It's hard being Smallville's only goth.
He sent me the autopsy report of Troy.

18:52.097 --> 18:55.589
It's amazing what lending someone
your eyeliner can get you.

18:58.203 --> 18:59.727
So Troy didn't have progeria.

18:59.905 --> 19:04.535
No, but his pituitary gland, which produces
a hormone that controls the aging process...

19:04.709 --> 19:08.873
...was completely drained. Like someone
just sucked the youth out of him.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.743
Well, that's quite an assumption,
Miss Sullivan.

19:13.518 --> 19:15.145
Principal Reynolds.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.313
I was just running through
various scenarios, you know...

19:19.491 --> 19:22.688
...wild theories and stuff.
I'm shutting up now.

19:22.994 --> 19:26.395
Well, don't. I like my students
thinking outside the box.

19:26.798 --> 19:29.130
I've been reading back issues
of The Torch.

19:29.301 --> 19:32.168
I see a lot of creativity
and insight there.

19:32.337 --> 19:35.864
- You're kidding.
- Well, unverified insight.

19:36.041 --> 19:40.569
But many a Pulitzer has sprung
from the seeds of wild theories.

19:43.181 --> 19:45.046
Just make sure you can back
them up.

19:45.217 --> 19:49.278
That'll be the difference between
writing trash for The Inquisitor...

19:49.454 --> 19:52.423
...and reporting for The Daily Planet.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.694
- Are you still up for that interview?
- Well, give me half an hour.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.730
Mr. Kent.

20:02.901 --> 20:05.335
I was actually looking for you.

20:06.404 --> 20:08.304
I'd like to see you in my office.

20:19.384 --> 20:24.845
- You look like you feel a little out of place.
- I've never been in the principal's office.

20:25.023 --> 20:29.050
You can start by sitting.
I'll cut right to the chase.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.853
I think you're a slacker.

20:33.031 --> 20:36.330
Quit the football team before you
played the first game...

20:36.501 --> 20:40.267
...chronic tardiness,
zero extracurriculars.

20:41.573 --> 20:45.441
I get very good grades and I write
for The Torch occasionally.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.474
Retyping the cafeteria menu
isn't exactly writing.

20:48.647 --> 20:51.480
I see a lot of untapped potential
in you, Mr. Kent.

20:51.816 --> 20:56.947
Mr. Reynolds, I don't understand, we just
met. How could you judge me so quickly?

20:57.122 --> 20:59.556
How do you know Lex Luthor?

21:00.425 --> 21:03.189
Well, he's a friend of mine. Why?

21:03.361 --> 21:05.727
A person is judged by
the company they keep.

21:05.897 --> 21:10.732
Lex Luthor doesn't have friends.
He sees people as a means towards an end.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.961
I don't think that's true.

21:13.505 --> 21:17.839
Time will tell. Frankly, I'm more interested
in your world. What are your goals?

21:18.009 --> 21:21.206
Well, I'd like to help people.

21:21.379 --> 21:22.676
Something like that.

21:22.847 --> 21:26.544
Helping people is a noble aspiration.
It's also rather vague.

21:26.718 --> 21:30.085
Where are you gonna be
five years from now?

21:30.989 --> 21:33.048
To tell the truth,
I'm not really sure.

21:33.224 --> 21:35.158
Well, I'm gonna help you to focus.

21:35.327 --> 21:39.764
I want you to write a five-page essay on
where you're gonna be five years from now.

21:39.931 --> 21:44.334
And I want it on my desk
by the end of the school day on Friday.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.371
Sir, why are you doing this to me?

21:50.075 --> 21:52.566
This isn't punishment, Mr. Kent.

21:52.744 --> 21:55.042
Consider it a challenge.

22:14.232 --> 22:17.998
Clark, hey. Just in time to volunteer
for the decorations committee.

22:18.169 --> 22:21.263
Actually, I've gotta finish my essay
for Mr. Reynolds.

22:21.439 --> 22:24.067
That's a bummer. What's it about?

22:24.743 --> 22:27.303
What the future theoretically
holds for me.

22:27.646 --> 22:30.308
Who cares about the future?

22:30.482 --> 22:33.451
- I like to think there's life after high school.
- Sure.

22:33.618 --> 22:37.554
Yeah, as in a job, responsibilities,
getting old.

22:48.667 --> 22:51.227
- Is everything all right?
- Of course.

22:52.604 --> 22:55.505
Krissy, we've got the lighting
the way you want it.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.905
Great. Let's see what you got.

23:05.350 --> 23:06.908
Let me guess.

23:07.085 --> 23:11.021
Reynolds wants to know where you
see yourself five years from now?

23:12.824 --> 23:15.622
He made me do that assignment
when I was at Excelsior.

23:15.794 --> 23:17.819
He's nothing if not consistent.

23:20.265 --> 23:23.496
He doesn't exactly have
a high opinion of you.

23:23.668 --> 23:28.935
I wasn't a model student, but imagine being
a bald 14-year-old in an elite prep school.

23:29.107 --> 23:32.599
- Must have been tough.
- I had a major chip on my shoulder.

23:32.777 --> 23:34.244
But Reynolds saw through it.

23:34.412 --> 23:39.042
He challenged me to own up to my actions,
not to assume the mantle of the rich kid.

23:39.217 --> 23:42.152
He was tough but fair.
I liked him for that.

23:42.320 --> 23:47.815
I wish the feeling was mutual. Whatever he
has against you, he's taking it out on me.

23:48.059 --> 23:51.893
I'm sorry being friends with me
comes with such a high price.

23:53.965 --> 23:57.901
So exactly how long were you planning
to work on this essay?

23:59.104 --> 24:01.538
I'm just not ready to go home yet.

24:05.677 --> 24:09.374
- Something wrong?
- No, it's just family stuff.

24:09.647 --> 24:12.480
Come on, Clark, I'm the king
of family dysfunction.

24:14.686 --> 24:18.622
My father and grandfather hate each other,
and I feel caught in the middle.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.758
And you'd like to play peacemaker.

24:20.925 --> 24:24.383
Best thing to do is put them in a room
and let them fight it out.

24:24.562 --> 24:26.860
So you're saying I should
play hardball.

24:27.031 --> 24:28.931
That's up to you, but...

24:29.100 --> 24:34.299
...it'll take that sort of determination to
bring your father and grandfather together.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.569
What do you think?

24:40.745 --> 24:43.373
Perfect.

24:43.681 --> 24:46.809
- Thank you for doing this, Russell.
- It's been a weird week.

24:46.985 --> 24:50.682
- Feels good to be doing something.
- I know you and Troy were friends.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.819
I really miss him.

24:56.161 --> 24:59.221
Well, that's why I came to see you,
Russell.

24:59.397 --> 25:01.388
For Troy.

25:03.434 --> 25:05.595
For the others.

25:05.770 --> 25:08.603
The others?
What are you talking about?

25:12.877 --> 25:15.368
The ones who will live inside me forever.

25:36.934 --> 25:38.299
Hey, Dad, got a minute?

25:38.469 --> 25:42.929
You gotta talk to me while we're working.
We got a lot to do before it gets dark.

25:43.107 --> 25:45.735
There's someone I want you to see.

25:52.583 --> 25:56.075
- Your mother put you up to this?
- No, this was all my idea.

25:56.254 --> 25:57.516
Don't blame the boy.

25:57.688 --> 26:01.317
The problems we have are between us.
Martha says you need help.

26:01.492 --> 26:02.789
I'm here to give it.

26:02.960 --> 26:07.693
- So now you want to be part of this family?
- I don't want anything from you.

26:07.865 --> 26:11.392
I brought a check because
I won't watch my daughter suffer.

26:11.569 --> 26:15.198
- Couldn't resist turning that knife?
- Dad, give him a chance.

26:15.373 --> 26:18.365
- You two can work this out.
- I don't think so, son.

26:18.543 --> 26:21.671
It's just like 20 years ago,
the same argument and attitude.

26:21.846 --> 26:26.476
Not quite. It has been 20 years.
But everything I predicted has come true.

26:27.085 --> 26:31.021
I knew Martha was making
a big mistake when she married you.

26:31.189 --> 26:33.180
That's not true, Granddad.

26:33.658 --> 26:36.650
You'll have to swallow
your pride to save this farm.

26:36.828 --> 26:39.797
I don't need a lecture on how
to take care of my family.

26:39.964 --> 26:43.422
You're just as stubborn and pig-headed
as you were the day we met.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.626
You get off my land.

26:46.237 --> 26:48.034
Gladly.

26:48.573 --> 26:50.564
Granddad, wait.

26:51.242 --> 26:54.609
- It wasn't supposed to be like this.
- Just let him go, son.

26:55.313 --> 26:57.781
I know you had good intentions...

26:57.949 --> 27:00.042
...but some things just can't change.

27:03.387 --> 27:05.787
Let's unload the truck.

27:08.893 --> 27:11.760
- Clark, wait up.
- Hey.

27:13.664 --> 27:15.928
You look like the wind got
knocked out of you.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.864
I'm just dealing with
some family issues.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.637
You want to talk about it?

27:20.805 --> 27:23.137
The more I talk about it,
the worse they get.

27:23.307 --> 27:26.970
Did you guys hear about Russell?
They found his body behind the Talon.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.613
- What happened?
- He aged, like, 100 years.

27:29.780 --> 27:33.181
The police thought it was a homeless guy
until they found his ID.

27:33.351 --> 27:36.013
Two progeria deaths in two days,
what are the odds?

27:36.187 --> 27:40.590
Lana wanted to cancel the Spirit Week party
but Principal Reynolds asked her not to.

27:40.758 --> 27:43.124
He said he wanted to
keep things normal.

27:43.294 --> 27:47.754
He obviously hasn't had his normal meter
reset for Smallville.

27:54.238 --> 27:57.833
- What is it, Clark?
- I saw Russell with Krissy at the Talon.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.239
Troy was with her
before he went geriatric.

28:00.611 --> 28:03.705
- It's not exactly a smoking gun.
- It's worth a look.

28:03.881 --> 28:07.442
We could check out her old records.
See if there's anything strange.

28:07.618 --> 28:10.485
I'll get started
and I'll tell you what I find.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.156
Interesting choice.

28:20.364 --> 28:22.423
The Count of Monte Cristo.

28:23.868 --> 28:27.736
Classic tale of a man whose past
comes back to haunt him.

28:29.473 --> 28:31.907
Why are you here, Lex?

28:33.911 --> 28:36.675
We're upgrading our computer system
at the plant.

28:36.847 --> 28:40.044
Thought we might donate our
old computers to Smallville High.

28:40.451 --> 28:42.476
You are not an alumnus.

28:42.753 --> 28:44.846
Call it a thank-you.

28:46.691 --> 28:50.923
You pushed me.
And in hindsight, I appreciate that.

28:51.095 --> 28:54.258
In some ways, you're responsible
for the man I am today.

28:54.432 --> 28:58.027
I'm not sure that's a burden
I care to take on.

28:58.202 --> 29:02.229
Besides the tax deduction,
what's the quid pro quo?

29:03.040 --> 29:05.838
Now, why do you think
I want anything in return?

29:06.010 --> 29:10.310
Because I've learned there's always a price
when dealing with the Luthors.

29:11.816 --> 29:16.082
I want you to stop turning your antagonism
towards me against Clark Kent.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.913
Lionel has taught you well.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.857
- My father?
- Yes. This meeting?

29:24.028 --> 29:27.725
It reminds me of the incident
that almost got you expelled.

29:27.898 --> 29:31.459
- He had nothing to do with that.
- No, only later.

29:32.136 --> 29:34.798
After receiving notice of
your expulsion hearing...

29:34.972 --> 29:39.705
...he generously offered the school's
trustees a new library, with two conditions:

29:39.877 --> 29:44.314
That you were allowed to stay,
and I was allowed to go.

29:46.884 --> 29:51.344
History has an interesting way
of repeating itself, doesn't it?

30:02.700 --> 30:05.294
Clark, I hope I'm not interrupting.

30:05.636 --> 30:10.903
No, I could use the inspiration. I thought
you'd be swamped with party prep by now.

30:11.075 --> 30:14.704
I was heading over to the Talon,
but this arrived at my house.

30:16.647 --> 30:20.344
I asked Lex to look into those photos
of my mother.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.476
You think there's more to it
than meets the eye?

30:23.654 --> 30:27.181
I don't know, he sent me this.
I haven't opened it yet.

30:27.358 --> 30:30.885
As badly as I want the truth,
I'm afraid I won't like what I find.

30:31.062 --> 30:32.996
Why the change of heart?

30:33.164 --> 30:36.930
The image of my parents the way
I thought they were is all I have.

30:37.101 --> 30:39.592
You don't want to lose that.

30:39.770 --> 30:42.534
Maybe just by doubting, I already have.

30:45.543 --> 30:48.444
How are things with your grandfather?

30:48.612 --> 30:50.409
"Disaster" is an understatement.

30:50.581 --> 30:54.745
I took him to see my father.
It was like watching history repeat itself.

30:54.919 --> 30:56.409
So, what's next?

30:57.288 --> 30:59.313
I hate to see it end like this.

30:59.490 --> 31:02.550
But I can't control the way
they act around each other.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.285
Are you gonna try again?

31:04.795 --> 31:09.323
I can't do anything about the past.
Maybe I can do something about the future.

31:15.973 --> 31:18.464
- Clark.
- I don't want our relationship to end...

31:18.642 --> 31:21.270
...before it ever had a chance to begin.

31:21.746 --> 31:24.613
Well, you can come in
if you want.

31:25.816 --> 31:29.843
But you'll have to excuse me,
I'm running a little late.

31:33.891 --> 31:36.917
There's something I wanted
to show you.

31:37.728 --> 31:39.161
It's our photo album.

31:39.330 --> 31:44.165
School plays, camping trips, backyard
activities, stuff that families do together.

31:47.304 --> 31:50.102
I wanted you to see our family
the way I do.

31:50.274 --> 31:52.799
We're more than old arguments
and overdue bills.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.671
I'd like you to give this
to your mother.

31:57.848 --> 32:01.648
It's a cashier's check. Tell her she can
use it now, a year from now...

32:01.819 --> 32:06.188
...whenever she needs it.
- Why don't you give it to her yourself?

32:06.657 --> 32:08.147
I'm sorry, Clark.

32:08.526 --> 32:13.896
I don't understand how a man who hasn't
seen his family in 20 years can walk away.

32:22.139 --> 32:26.303
- Krissy, I need to talk to you.
- Is there a problem, Mr. Reynolds?

32:26.477 --> 32:29.537
I left three messages for your parents,
still no answer.

32:29.713 --> 32:31.146
They've been really busy.

32:31.315 --> 32:34.546
- Is this still about my transcripts?
- And you.

32:34.785 --> 32:38.277
I've been making an effort to get
to know the students and parents.

32:38.456 --> 32:41.687
Maybe I can come by your house
this weekend when they're home.

32:41.859 --> 32:44.054
They'll be at the Talon for the rally.

32:44.228 --> 32:49.359
- You could meet us there before the party.
- That'll be fine, see you there.

33:05.549 --> 33:07.915
Where have you been?
I left you six messages.

33:08.085 --> 33:12.613
- Sorry, it's been a weird day.
- Well, it's about to get weirder. Take a look.

33:12.790 --> 33:15.190
Florida, 12 years ago,
Piper High School.

33:15.359 --> 33:18.988
Three students died of the same
mysterious? Ber-progeria.

33:19.163 --> 33:22.189
All in a 48-hour period.
Let me guess, Krissy was involved.

33:22.533 --> 33:24.467
Try "Missy."

33:25.002 --> 33:27.095
Class of '90, Missy Parker.

33:27.271 --> 33:30.672
- Different name, same face.
- Yeah, it gets better.

33:31.141 --> 33:34.235
Lakewood High, Class of '81...
There she is again.

33:35.513 --> 33:39.108
You won't believe this. I matched Krissy
to triple progeria cases...

33:39.283 --> 33:42.878
...going back to Hammond
School for Girls, class of 1921.

33:43.053 --> 33:45.521
It's like she feeds off youth
to stay young.

33:45.689 --> 33:49.284
Takes the Peter Pan complex
to a whole new level.

33:49.460 --> 33:53.692
Troy was killed almost two days ago,
Russell was killed yesterday.

33:53.864 --> 33:56.924
- Krissy's gonna need another victim.
- I'll call the police.

34:00.604 --> 34:02.367
Clark?

34:20.857 --> 34:22.585
Krissy?

34:36.473 --> 34:38.407
Krissy?

34:39.609 --> 34:41.577
Mr. Reynolds.

34:41.745 --> 34:43.804
So, what do you think?

34:43.980 --> 34:47.938
I think you've taken Spirit Week
to a whole new level.

34:48.717 --> 34:53.052
- Are your parents here yet?
- Actually, Mr. Reynolds...

34:53.223 --> 34:55.384
...they died. Over a century ago.

34:55.792 --> 34:57.453
What are you talking about?

34:57.627 --> 35:01.620
See, I've seen the future, Mr. Reynolds,
again and again...

35:01.798 --> 35:03.959
...and I've learned one thing:

35:08.872 --> 35:12.899
These are the best years
of anyone's life.

35:18.748 --> 35:21.216
Clark, thought you were the band.

35:21.485 --> 35:25.979
If they don't show, we're stuck with
a half-dozen MP3s and my boom box.

35:26.156 --> 35:28.351
Have you seen Krissy?

35:28.525 --> 35:31.961
Yeah, she was just here.

35:40.804 --> 35:45.207
- What's going on?
- Just go lock the door, don't let anyone in.

35:47.344 --> 35:50.279
Krissy, stop!
I know what's going on.

35:50.714 --> 35:52.375
You need help.

35:53.750 --> 35:56.218
I need him.

36:01.424 --> 36:04.518
I'm not gonna let you
hurt anyone else.

36:04.694 --> 36:07.219
I am saving them, Clark.

36:07.397 --> 36:10.855
From lives that will never be as happy
as they are right now.

36:11.168 --> 36:15.127
- There's more to life than cheerleading.
- You're wrong.

36:16.006 --> 36:20.909
You will never be this young,
this beautiful...

36:21.778 --> 36:24.406
...or this perfect again.

36:25.415 --> 36:27.542
But I will.

37:04.921 --> 37:07.014
- More bills, huh, Dad?
- Yeah.

37:07.190 --> 37:09.886
Seems like these darned things
keep right on coming.

37:10.060 --> 37:13.086
Clark, you've had quite a week.
Any fallout from school?

37:13.263 --> 37:16.699
- Spirit Week is officially kaput.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

37:16.866 --> 37:18.265
Principal's gonna be okay.

37:18.435 --> 37:22.098
He warned me about being late
when they loaded him into the ambulance.

37:22.572 --> 37:26.303
I know the situation with your grandpa
is bugging you. It should, but...

37:26.476 --> 37:28.876
I went to go see him.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.376
He asked me to give this to you.

37:36.853 --> 37:40.448
He said he tried to get involved
in my life after the adoption.

37:40.624 --> 37:43.218
Why wouldn't you let him see me?

37:43.393 --> 37:44.792
Well, it's complicated.

37:44.961 --> 37:48.055
It can't be that complicated,
he's my grandfather.

37:49.366 --> 37:52.335
Clark, when you were a little boy...

37:52.502 --> 37:55.437
...you couldn't control
your abilities like now.

37:55.605 --> 38:00.201
If he'd spent any time with us, I think
he might have found out your secret.

38:00.377 --> 38:01.742
He's family.

38:01.911 --> 38:05.608
We had such a history of disagreeing
on things...

38:05.782 --> 38:08.273
...we just didn't know how he'd react.

38:08.451 --> 38:11.784
We couldn't be sure we could trust him.

38:12.255 --> 38:15.588
So he's not a part of our lives
because of me?

38:16.293 --> 38:20.855
Son, every young man wants to have
a relationship with his grandpa.

38:21.264 --> 38:24.825
But in your case,
it just may not be possible.

38:36.613 --> 38:38.080
Lana.

38:38.381 --> 38:41.578
- Working on something important?
- Just finished my essay.

38:41.751 --> 38:46.518
- So where you gonna be in five years?
- In college, probably studying journalism.

38:47.090 --> 38:48.819
You're kidding.

38:48.992 --> 38:51.517
Don't tell Chloe,
but I think it's growing on me.

38:51.695 --> 38:55.927
I like to find the truth behind things.
I'm tired of having secrets in my life.

38:56.099 --> 38:57.464
And personally?

39:00.470 --> 39:05.271
I've decided I'm gonna find a way to have
a relationship with my grandfather.

39:06.476 --> 39:09.172
How about you, is everything okay?

39:09.879 --> 39:12.473
Clark, I read Lex's file.

39:12.649 --> 39:16.244
According to court papers,
my parents filed for divorce in 1985.

39:16.419 --> 39:18.353
Irreconcilable differences.

39:18.521 --> 39:21.354
- But they worked it out, right?
- Eventually.

39:21.524 --> 39:24.584
But they were legally separated
for over a year.

39:25.362 --> 39:28.820
- So the guy in the picture...?
- Could be more than a friend.

39:32.102 --> 39:35.765
I was born right after my parents
got back together.

39:38.608 --> 39:41.236
My father could still be alive.

39:42.305 --> 39:48.662
