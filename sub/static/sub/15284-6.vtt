10:58.956 --> 11:01.357
Mm, searching for bad boys.
It's my specialty.

11:01.425 --> 11:02.793
I'll hit you
with a list ASAP.

11:02.860 --> 11:05.095
- Thank you, angel.
- Mm-hmm.

11:20.911 --> 11:22.510
Hey.

11:22.577 --> 11:23.477
Hey?

11:23.545 --> 11:25.213
That's all
you've got is "hey"?

11:25.281 --> 11:26.647
You mad at me?

11:26.715 --> 11:28.149
Mad at you? Why would I
be mad at you, Toby?

11:28.217 --> 11:29.517
You do something wrong?

11:29.584 --> 11:32.120
Get in the car.

11:32.188 --> 11:34.923
Get in the damn car.

11:44.465 --> 11:46.800
What do you got to say
for yourself?

11:46.868 --> 11:49.436
I got your texts.
I'm sorry. All right?

11:49.503 --> 11:51.905
We've been over this. You know
how bad that could have been?

11:51.973 --> 11:53.940
Yeah, I--look,
I was nervous,

11:54.007 --> 11:56.309
I freaked out. I don't--
I don't really know what happened.

11:56.376 --> 11:58.311
It wasn't like
I thought it was gonna be.

12:01.181 --> 12:02.982
I'm sorry.

12:05.219 --> 12:09.055
They say it's never as good
as your first time.

12:09.122 --> 12:11.757
The truth is...

12:11.825 --> 12:14.092
first time sucks.

12:15.795 --> 12:17.830
You don't know
what you're doing.

12:17.897 --> 12:20.198
You're fumbling around.

12:20.266 --> 12:22.334
It's awkward.

12:22.402 --> 12:25.404
It does get better.

12:25.472 --> 12:28.305
I promise.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.541
All right.

12:30.609 --> 12:33.043
You know what?

12:33.111 --> 12:36.481
I might have just the thing
to make you feel better.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.885
I didn't even know the Bureau
had a softball team.

12:40.952 --> 12:42.552
Since when do you play?

12:42.620 --> 12:44.153
Since Morgan drafted me.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.256
Really? Why?

12:46.323 --> 12:47.991
Don't let the skinny
geek thing fool you.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.394
I know the good doctor's
deceptively athletic.

12:50.461 --> 12:52.763
Oh, it's deceptive,
all right.

12:52.830 --> 12:54.163
Blake, what did you find out?

12:54.231 --> 12:55.866
None of the pet owners
had much.

12:55.933 --> 12:58.067
Each of their dogs just
disappeared from their yard.

12:58.135 --> 13:00.035
But he did get into
their yards unnoticed,

13:00.103 --> 13:02.938
so that means he stalked them
and knew their patterns.

13:03.006 --> 13:05.307
What about the list
of juvenile offenders Garcia sent us?

13:05.375 --> 13:07.209
Local P.D.'s checking out
a few names that caught my eye.

13:07.277 --> 13:09.978
Excuse me. Agent Hotchner,

13:10.046 --> 13:12.415
another woman's body
was just found.

13:12.482 --> 13:14.449
That was quick.

13:14.517 --> 13:16.117
[Siren]

13:16.184 --> 13:19.854
Morgan: Ok. I got it.

13:20.856 --> 13:22.290
Her name is Vicky Thomas.

13:22.357 --> 13:23.291
22-year-old prostitute.

13:23.358 --> 13:25.293
Originally
out of Daytona Beach.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.961
And she's got
a 2-year-old son.

13:27.029 --> 13:27.995
Reid: Victimology matches.

13:28.063 --> 13:29.964
Blake: So does the plastic bag.

13:30.032 --> 13:32.399
Guys, this is a residential area,
not frequented by prostitutes.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.568
Well, he didn't kill her
here, he just dumped her.

13:34.636 --> 13:37.805
He didn't beat her either.
She took a blow to the head.

13:37.872 --> 13:40.140
Bite marks. Pretty rare M.O.

13:40.207 --> 13:41.475
He didn't do that
to the other victim.

13:41.543 --> 13:42.976
And look at her.
She's filthy.

13:43.044 --> 13:44.978
He must have rolled her
around in all this trash.

13:45.046 --> 13:47.313
Probably a forensic countermeasure
used to degrade the crime scene.

13:47.380 --> 13:48.481
And the victim.

13:48.549 --> 13:50.483
Ok, so he beats and suffocates
his first victim

13:50.551 --> 13:52.618
and just dumps her.

13:52.686 --> 13:54.119
But this one
he clocks over the head,

13:54.187 --> 13:56.288
bites her,
but he covers his tracks.

13:56.356 --> 13:58.223
That's a huge shift in M.O.
you think he's evolving?

13:58.291 --> 13:59.959
Well, that's a pretty
rapid evolution.

14:00.026 --> 14:01.327
It might not even be
the same guy.

14:01.394 --> 14:02.594
Well, it can't be
a copycat.

14:02.662 --> 14:03.795
The story literally
just made the news.

14:03.863 --> 14:05.964
Yeah, and what about
the plastic bag?

14:06.031 --> 14:07.265
He used that
on both victims.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.767
Yeah, but nothing
about the second kill

14:08.835 --> 14:11.470
says young or impulsive.
He thought this one through.

14:11.537 --> 14:14.473
Guys, what if we're
dealing with a team?

14:14.540 --> 14:17.509
If there are two of them,
they're feeding off each other.

14:17.577 --> 14:20.377
This could turn into a spree
real soon.

14:40.364 --> 14:41.197
Hey there.

14:41.264 --> 14:43.232
How you doin'?

14:43.300 --> 14:46.302
I'm good, baby.
How are you?

14:46.370 --> 14:47.737
Oh, I had a hard day
at work.

14:47.805 --> 14:50.206
I'm just looking
for a little fun.

14:50.273 --> 14:51.974
How much?

14:52.041 --> 14:53.775
Depends on what you want.

14:53.843 --> 14:55.844
I want it all.

14:55.912 --> 14:58.547
200.

14:58.615 --> 15:00.749
[Exhales]

15:00.817 --> 15:02.551
Sold.

15:02.619 --> 15:03.952
Get in.

15:08.356 --> 15:10.357
So what's your name?

15:10.425 --> 15:11.458
Shawna.

15:11.527 --> 15:14.896
Shawna.
That's a pretty name.

15:14.963 --> 15:16.764
[Grunting]

15:16.832 --> 15:19.366
Sit back and relax
and enjoy the ride.

15:19.434 --> 15:20.367
Uhh!

15:20.435 --> 15:23.369
Hey! You don't want
to make me use this.

15:23.437 --> 15:25.104
Not so tight.
Not so tight.

15:25.172 --> 15:27.206
You want to make
this part last.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.175
The trick is you want to
give her a good scare.

15:29.243 --> 15:31.310
That way she does
whatever you say.

15:31.378 --> 15:32.578
Isn't that right,
Shawna?

15:32.646 --> 15:35.314
You're gonna do whatever
we tell you, aren't you?

15:35.382 --> 15:36.682
Yeah.

15:44.145 --> 15:47.247
[Indistinct police radio]

15:47.315 --> 15:50.552
Jogger ran by this morning.
Said his dog went crazy.

15:50.652 --> 15:52.753
They're not bothering
about hiding the bodies.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.888
Not worried about being
connected to their victims.

15:55.956 --> 15:56.889
Arrogant.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.991
What do you we know
about her?

15:59.059 --> 16:00.260
Name is Shawna Radford.

16:00.328 --> 16:02.028
21-year-old prostitute.

16:02.096 --> 16:04.097
Some of my guys
have seen her around.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.965
She doesn't trick
anywhere near here.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.667
There's no apparent
bite marks.

16:07.735 --> 16:09.736
She's got a lot
of swelling and bruising.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.003
She obviously took a blow
to the forehead.

16:12.071 --> 16:13.905
Looks like it could have been
a hammer.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.974
So why do they even
need the bag?

16:16.042 --> 16:17.710
Suffocation's
a form of torture.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.845
And they enjoy
watching her suffer.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.180
It's also become
something of a signature.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.417
In this case,
it's part M.O., part ritual.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.719
And this combines elements
of the first and second murders.

16:27.786 --> 16:29.554
The first time
was violent and sloppy.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.755
No planning,

16:30.822 --> 16:33.224
no forensic countermeasures.
Just a lot of rage.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.793
The second murder
was more sophisticated.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.396
If this is a team, one of them might be
much younger than the other.

16:38.464 --> 16:41.499
Which means the older unsub
is probably the more dominant partner.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.967
He's teaching him.

16:44.034 --> 16:46.903
The first kill was committed
by the younger unsub.

16:46.971 --> 16:49.239
It was exactly that,
his very first.

16:49.307 --> 16:51.107
So he probably did it alone.

16:51.175 --> 16:52.576
So what does that make
the second kill?

16:52.644 --> 16:53.843
A demonstration.

16:53.911 --> 16:57.281
And this one's about perfecting
their M.O. together.

16:57.348 --> 16:59.682
When can I take
this thing off?

16:59.750 --> 17:01.717
This is a surprise.
Why do you want to ruin it?

17:01.785 --> 17:03.519
I--'cause I don't like
surprises.

17:03.587 --> 17:04.853
[Chuckles]

17:04.921 --> 17:09.090
We are... here.

17:12.028 --> 17:15.297
You know, when we started
this whole thing, I wasn't sure, I just--

17:15.364 --> 17:17.699
you know, I didn't know
if you had it in you.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.300
Thanks a lot?

17:19.367 --> 17:20.968
Last couple nights,

17:21.036 --> 17:24.806
I mean, you've come
a long way.

17:24.873 --> 17:26.374
I'm proud of you, Toby.

17:26.442 --> 17:28.376
I really am.

17:31.446 --> 17:34.247
Go ahead.
Take that thing off.

17:34.316 --> 17:35.683
Ok.

17:37.051 --> 17:38.652
Ta-daa!

17:40.188 --> 17:41.789
This is your surprise?

17:41.856 --> 17:44.658
It's graduation day,
my man.

17:44.726 --> 17:46.959
Come on.

17:49.162 --> 17:51.864
Based on victim type
and kill zone dynamics,

17:51.932 --> 17:53.899
we believe that we're
looking for two white males,

17:53.967 --> 17:55.735
one significantly older
than the other.

17:55.803 --> 17:58.404
The younger unsub we believe
is an adolescent.

17:58.472 --> 18:00.373
He probably
lives in the area,

18:00.441 --> 18:02.941
so odds are he's a student
at a local high school.

18:03.008 --> 18:07.212
We think the older unsub
is in his late 30s to early 40s.

18:07.279 --> 18:08.302
Now, he's sophisticated,

18:08.327 --> 18:10.411
so he probably has violent
criminal experience.

18:10.416 --> 18:12.050
So you should be looking
at ex-cons,

18:12.117 --> 18:14.019
and we can't rule out
people who've had

18:14.044 --> 18:15.687
law enforcement training.

18:15.688 --> 18:17.723
Blake: The older one
had access to teenagers,

18:17.790 --> 18:19.357
but somehow
he didn't stick out.

18:19.424 --> 18:21.859
Reid: Which means he most likely
lives or works near an area

18:21.926 --> 18:23.193
where young people congregate.

18:23.261 --> 18:25.463
Like a school, church,
or a community center.

18:25.530 --> 18:26.864
Now, he's also charismatic,

18:26.931 --> 18:28.999
the type of guy that
a teen would easily trust.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.701
Maybe a teacher or a coach.

18:30.769 --> 18:31.769
No. No, no, no.

18:31.837 --> 18:34.437
It's lightweight, cheap.
It won't last.

18:34.505 --> 18:35.872
Now, this one--

18:35.939 --> 18:38.040
look, it's a little more
expensive, but it's worth it.

18:38.108 --> 18:39.809
Reid: Much like
the D.C. snipers,

18:39.877 --> 18:41.210
John Allen Muhammad
and Lee Boyd Malvo,

18:41.278 --> 18:42.679
this is a mentor/mentee
relationship,

18:42.747 --> 18:45.047
where the old one is attempting
to teach the younger one

18:45.115 --> 18:46.215
to become a better killer.

18:46.283 --> 18:48.718
This dynamic is rare,
but the symbiotic nature

18:48.786 --> 18:50.575
of their mutual desires
actually strengthens their

18:50.600 --> 18:51.787
affinity for one another.

18:51.788 --> 18:54.222
There's a chance
they're related.

18:54.290 --> 18:56.892
We should consider
a father and son team,

18:56.959 --> 18:58.894
brothers, or possibly
an Uncle and nephew.

18:58.961 --> 19:01.229
Rossi: But even if there
is no biological connection,

19:01.297 --> 19:04.900
this relationship has all the hallmarks
of their kind of bond.

19:04.967 --> 19:07.535
Hotch: The younger one's
probably looking for a father figure,

19:07.603 --> 19:09.837
trying to fill
some emotional void.

19:09.905 --> 19:11.071
No fuss, no muss.

19:11.139 --> 19:14.509
You have your fun and
Johnny law's none the wiser.

19:14.576 --> 19:16.076
They prey on prostitutes,

19:16.144 --> 19:17.412
so put the word
on the street

19:17.479 --> 19:19.346
to any of the working girls
you may know.

19:19.415 --> 19:20.581
Yeah, I like this one.

19:20.649 --> 19:22.582
Ohh... o ho ho.

19:22.650 --> 19:25.251
That's a $100 titanium
framing hammer.

19:25.319 --> 19:27.353
[Sucks in breath]
Beautiful...

19:27.422 --> 19:28.988
easily traced.

19:30.591 --> 19:32.025
Now, this one,

19:32.092 --> 19:36.362
this is your garden variety
$5.00 16-ouncer with a steel head.

19:36.431 --> 19:38.364
Sold at a hundred stores
everywhere.

19:38.432 --> 19:40.699
This is the one you want.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.535
Hotch: And their pace
is relentless.

19:42.602 --> 19:45.771
Given their combined appetites
and the player-coach dynamic,

19:45.839 --> 19:48.073
these two are especially
dangerous.

19:48.141 --> 19:49.608
Thank you very much.

19:49.676 --> 19:52.445
All right, let's hit it,
people.

19:52.512 --> 19:53.946
Hotch: What have you
got, Garcia?

19:54.013 --> 19:55.880
Sir, I am afraid
I have come up dry.

19:55.948 --> 19:58.249
A lot of weird stuff
happens in South Florida.

19:58.317 --> 20:01.820
I found a few hammer attacks,
a shocking number of biting attacks,

20:01.887 --> 20:04.088
but only one or the other,
no combo platters.

20:04.156 --> 20:05.557
All right, go back
another 10 years.

20:05.624 --> 20:06.991
And look nationwide.

20:07.059 --> 20:09.627
Our older unsub must
have a criminal past.

20:09.695 --> 20:12.395
That M.O. is too specific to just
be popping up this late in his life.

20:12.464 --> 20:13.664
You got it.
Back in a flash.

20:13.731 --> 20:16.433
Hotch: All right,
thanks, Garcia.

20:16.501 --> 20:19.369
Hey. I ruled out most of the kids
on that offender list,

20:19.437 --> 20:22.439
but there is one
that I'm having brought in.

20:22.507 --> 20:24.641
His name is Jose Aguilar.

20:24.709 --> 20:27.209
He moved to Miami right around
the time the animal murders started.

20:27.277 --> 20:29.846
Kicked out of two schools
in Orlando for bullying.

20:29.913 --> 20:32.515
Broke one kid's nose.
Gave the other a concussion.

20:32.583 --> 20:34.416
But that's not why
I want to talk to him.

20:34.485 --> 20:35.985
He made a visit to the E.R.,

20:36.052 --> 20:40.155
right after being attacked
by a guy with a hammer.

20:40.223 --> 20:42.491
The kid refused to make
an official police report.

20:42.558 --> 20:44.960
Apparently he hates cops.

20:45.027 --> 20:47.228
Keep me posted.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.932
Jose, appreciate
you coming in, man.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.767
Like I had a choice.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.335
Why am I here?

20:54.403 --> 20:57.438
Look, it's all good,
all right?

20:57.507 --> 20:59.540
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

20:59.608 --> 21:02.275
I didn't do anything.
I don't know anything. We done?

21:02.343 --> 21:04.678
Kid, I get it.
The neighborhood I grew up in,

21:04.746 --> 21:05.946
we hated Five-0, too.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.447
Oh, so you can relate.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.483
We're not those kind
of cops, man.

21:09.551 --> 21:11.351
Oh, whatever.

21:11.419 --> 21:13.453
I think I can relate.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.555
I doubt that.

21:15.623 --> 21:16.853
Because when you look at me,

21:16.878 --> 21:18.856
you jump to a particular
set of conclusions.

21:19.292 --> 21:21.188
It's human nature
to make assumptions

21:21.213 --> 21:22.461
based on appearances.

21:22.462 --> 21:24.163
It's an outdated
primal instinct

21:24.231 --> 21:26.566
born of our need to quickly
assess our surroundings.

21:26.634 --> 21:28.334
Of course, in this modern era,

21:28.402 --> 21:30.569
those assumptions
tend to be very wrong and...

21:30.637 --> 21:32.070
often quite hurtful.

21:32.138 --> 21:33.609
It happens to me a lot,

21:33.634 --> 21:35.347
and I bet that happens
to you all the time.

21:38.545 --> 21:40.546
I swear I didn't
do anything.

21:40.613 --> 21:41.334
We believe you.

21:41.359 --> 21:43.858
We just want to know what
you wouldn't tell the cops

21:43.983 --> 21:47.018
about the man that
attacked you with the hammer.

21:47.085 --> 21:49.353
I don't remember much.

21:49.421 --> 21:51.355
You want to try something
interesting?

21:51.423 --> 21:54.691
This may sound crazy,
but close your eyes and concentrate.

21:54.759 --> 21:55.655
I think you'd be surprised

21:55.680 --> 21:57.805
to see how much
you can remember if you try.

21:58.629 --> 22:00.063
All right.

22:00.130 --> 22:02.566
Do you remember what you were.
doing that day before the attack?

22:02.633 --> 22:05.001
Just went to school.

22:05.069 --> 22:07.938
What was the weather like?

22:08.005 --> 22:10.405
[Exhales] Hot.

22:14.210 --> 22:15.978
Hey. Sorry I'm a little late.

22:16.046 --> 22:17.880
An hour's
more than a little.

22:17.948 --> 22:19.481
I said I was sorry.

22:19.549 --> 22:21.817
You've been late almost every day
for the past two weeks.

22:21.885 --> 22:24.553
I've been really busy with school
and stuff. I'll do better.

22:24.620 --> 22:28.022
Toby,
I have to let you go.

22:28.090 --> 22:29.223
What?

22:29.291 --> 22:31.392
I warned you a bunch of times
about being late.

22:31.460 --> 22:33.494
I--

22:33.562 --> 22:34.929
I'm sorry.

22:34.997 --> 22:36.530
Then there was that thing
with the puppies.

22:36.599 --> 22:37.865
That wasn't my fault.

22:37.933 --> 22:39.801
Look, it's my job
to manage this place,

22:39.868 --> 22:41.902
and I can't do my job
if you can't do yours.

22:41.970 --> 22:44.471
Hollie, Hollie, please.

22:44.538 --> 22:47.273
You should go clean out
your locker.

22:47.341 --> 22:48.875
Sorry.

22:52.379 --> 22:56.649
And what were you doing
just before the attack?

22:57.985 --> 23:00.519
Walking home from school.

23:00.587 --> 23:03.255
I cut through the park
'cause I had to take a leak.

23:03.323 --> 23:04.957
Then I heard this barking.

23:05.025 --> 23:06.592
[Barking]
Then I saw this kid

23:06.660 --> 23:09.495
and he was beating
on this dog.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.931
It pissed me off.
I like dogs.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.064
Hey!

23:13.132 --> 23:15.834
So I jumped the kid,
started beating his ass,

23:15.901 --> 23:17.435
and the dog ran away.

23:17.503 --> 23:19.114
The next thing I know,
I get hit in the back

23:19.139 --> 23:20.705
with something hard.

23:20.706 --> 23:21.906
Uhh!

23:21.974 --> 23:23.942
It hurt like a bitch.

23:24.010 --> 23:27.145
I look up and see
some dude with a hammer.

23:27.212 --> 23:30.080
He popped me one more time
in the arm before I took off.

23:30.148 --> 23:32.282
Did you know the kid
who was beating the dog?

23:32.350 --> 23:34.217
Some white kid.
Never seen him.

23:34.285 --> 23:35.719
He doesn't
go to my school.

23:35.787 --> 23:37.121
What about the guy
with the hammer?

23:37.188 --> 23:40.624
He was white, too,
but older.

23:40.692 --> 23:42.960
Could you describe him
to a sketch artist?

23:43.028 --> 23:47.764
The older dude--
no, it happened too fast.

23:47.831 --> 23:49.532
But the kid...

23:49.599 --> 23:52.234
I think so.

23:58.842 --> 24:01.276
[Dogs barking]

24:18.259 --> 24:19.860
Good night.

24:19.928 --> 24:22.096
See you tomorrow.

24:47.388 --> 24:48.555
Aah!

24:55.042 --> 24:56.710
So Jose rolls up
on the younger unsub

24:56.777 --> 24:58.578
while he's doing his thing.

24:58.645 --> 25:00.722
But the older unsub
just happens to be there

25:00.747 --> 25:01.981
to come to his rescue?

25:02.099 --> 25:04.634
Or the older one
was already there watching.

25:05.116 --> 25:07.817
That attack happened months ago,
so they've known each other

25:07.885 --> 25:09.485
at least that long.

25:09.553 --> 25:13.556
Why would a grown man
in his 40s connect with a teenager?

25:13.624 --> 25:15.390
Easily explained
if they're related.

25:15.458 --> 25:17.225
Or if their relationship
is sexual.

25:17.293 --> 25:19.628
Well, if they were related
or having sex,

25:19.696 --> 25:21.630
there would probably
be more of a connection

25:21.698 --> 25:23.732
and there might not be
such a big disparity in their M.O.s.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.047
The dominant partner
might not even allow

25:26.048 --> 25:28.134
the submissive
to participate in the kill.

25:28.138 --> 25:30.805
If he's mentoring him, maybe
it's because he wants to give back

25:30.873 --> 25:32.807
or leave some kind of legacy.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.533
Well, like in most cases,
the dominant one probably

25:34.558 --> 25:35.943
initiated the contact.

25:35.944 --> 25:37.511
You think he sought
the younger one out.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.147
That's usually how it goes.

25:39.214 --> 25:41.082
It takes talent to see talent.

25:41.150 --> 25:42.984
When and where they met
is gonna be the key.

25:43.052 --> 25:45.986
It's only a matter of time
before their partnership dissolves.

25:46.054 --> 25:48.254
In an student/teacher dynamic
there comes a day

25:48.322 --> 25:51.992

no longer needs the teacher.

right there

26:36.801 --> 26:38.802
in the Sing Sing prison yard,
died last July.

26:38.870 --> 26:42.206
That M.O. is too similar to what
we've seen not to be related.

26:42.273 --> 26:43.607
But the timeline
doesn't fit.

26:43.674 --> 26:46.443
Stein got locked up
over 20 years ago.

26:46.510 --> 26:48.812
What if the mentor
got mentored himself?

26:48.880 --> 26:51.447
So you think Stein mentored
our older unsub?

26:51.514 --> 26:52.849
Then the unsub learned
his skills in prison.

26:52.916 --> 26:54.951
There's a reason
they call it Crime U.

26:55.018 --> 26:58.054
If the guy who took the time
to mentor him suddenly died,

26:58.122 --> 27:00.522
it could have triggered
his need to pay it forward.

28:17.963 --> 28:20.198
So, he has a preference
for younger boys.

a teenage apprentice.

Rick James seem Amish.

31:10.359 --> 31:13.527
I also looked at his emails
and social networks.

31:13.595 --> 31:16.063
He's been in touch a lot
with a Toby Whitewood,

31:16.131 --> 31:18.699
and by a lot, I mean a couple,
3 times a day for the last year.

31:18.766 --> 31:20.201
Well, what do you got
on Whitewood?

31:20.268 --> 31:22.470
He's a 15-year-old sophomore
at McKinley High School.

31:22.537 --> 31:23.971
His parents divorced
two years ago.

31:24.039 --> 31:26.907
He lives with his mom Claire.
That's about it. He's squeaky clean.

31:26.975 --> 31:29.809
Garcia, what about
employment or volunteer activities?

31:29.877 --> 31:33.913
Pause. He works part-time
at Hal's pet shop.

31:33.981 --> 31:35.315
Blake: You got a picture
of the kid?

31:35.383 --> 31:36.582
Sent.

31:36.650 --> 31:38.885
[Beeping]

31:39.953 --> 31:43.323
Garcia, that's him.
You got an address?

31:43.391 --> 31:45.090
Yep. Work address
has been sent to you.

31:45.158 --> 31:47.526
Home address is actually
closer to Hotch.

31:47.593 --> 31:48.527
Thanks.

31:48.594 --> 31:49.828
That explains how
he got close to Toby.

31:49.896 --> 31:51.163
Somehow he figured out
who was committing

31:51.231 --> 31:52.664
the animal murders,
he stalked him at his job

31:52.732 --> 31:54.099
and eventually
earned his trust.

31:54.167 --> 31:57.669
[Muffled cries]

31:57.737 --> 31:59.238
At least help me
get her on the boat?

31:59.305 --> 32:01.605
No, I'll do it.
You, uh, you clean the car.

32:01.673 --> 32:03.707
Use the supplies
in that locker.

32:03.775 --> 32:05.876
And when I say clean,
I mean spic and span.

32:05.944 --> 32:07.111
But then we can take her
out on the boat.

32:07.179 --> 32:08.546
We are not gonna do anything.

32:08.613 --> 32:09.880
I'm gonna take her
out on the boat.

32:09.948 --> 32:11.115
I'm gonna get rid of her.

32:11.183 --> 32:12.983
And you are gonna
get rid of that car.

32:13.052 --> 32:15.553
What?! That's not fair.
She's mine.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.554
No. No, no, no.

32:17.621 --> 32:19.956
The second you brought her
over to my house,

32:20.024 --> 32:22.059
she became mine.

32:22.126 --> 32:24.594
Now go.

32:24.662 --> 32:26.663
Did you not hear me?

32:26.730 --> 32:28.798
[Hollie sobbing]

32:33.570 --> 32:36.805
You know, you don't tell me
what to do. You're not my father.

32:40.009 --> 32:42.649
No. Your father bailed
on you and your mom

32:42.674 --> 32:43.479
'cause he couldn't deal.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.881
Me, I'm the guy
that got you through it.

32:45.949 --> 32:47.816
Don't act like you did me
some big favor.

32:47.884 --> 32:49.617
I know exactly
what you wanted, perv.

32:49.685 --> 32:51.719
What's that, Tobe?

32:51.787 --> 32:54.222
You think that I don't see the way
you look at me?

32:54.290 --> 32:57.258
I'm not stupid,
you know.

32:57.326 --> 33:01.496
I should have trusted my gut.
You don't have it in you.

33:01.564 --> 33:04.099
You're nothing but
a sad little loser.

33:04.166 --> 33:08.168
You're an old ex-con
that likes hanging out with kids,

33:08.236 --> 33:11.004
and...I'm the loser?

33:11.072 --> 33:14.508
You're wasting my time.

33:16.677 --> 33:18.112
Get out of here.

33:18.179 --> 33:19.513
Come on, pretty girl.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.114
[Whimpering]

33:21.181 --> 33:22.515
Uhh!

33:22.583 --> 33:25.651
[Sobbing]

33:38.097 --> 33:40.932
[Sobbing]

33:57.637 --> 33:58.570
Claire Whitewood?

33:58.638 --> 33:59.704
Yes.

33:59.772 --> 34:01.607
We're with the FBI.
We're looking for Toby.

34:01.674 --> 34:03.074
He's not here.

34:03.143 --> 34:04.075
You know where he is?

34:04.144 --> 34:06.911
I haven't seen him
since this morning.

34:07.980 --> 34:10.315
What did he do?

34:10.382 --> 34:11.616
Yeah, go ahead, Garcia.
What do you got?

34:11.683 --> 34:14.518
Two things. One--
David Roy Turner's father Nate,

34:14.585 --> 34:16.687
he was a boat mechanic.
He owned a repair shop.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.556
He died 12 years ago,
but according to public records,

34:18.623 --> 34:21.091
it's still in his name.
Yes, I just sent you the address.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.426
[Beeping]

34:22.494 --> 34:24.262
Yeah, I got it.
Hang on, guys.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.033
[Siren]

34:30.100 --> 34:32.302
Blake: What was
the second thing, Garcia?

34:32.370 --> 34:34.036
The second thing is, is that
the manager at the pet store

34:34.103 --> 34:36.339
where Toby works at was just
reported missing by her fiance,

34:36.407 --> 34:38.308
and her name is Hollie Riggio.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.210
If Toby had anything to do
with the girl's disappearance,

34:40.277 --> 34:41.678
then his victim preference
is changing.

34:41.745 --> 34:43.045
Or the prostitutes
were just practice

34:43.112 --> 34:44.346
for the girl
he really wanted.

34:44.414 --> 34:47.283
[Crying]

34:51.420 --> 34:53.289
You know,
the old guy was right.

34:53.356 --> 34:56.391
Taking my time to see
that look in your eyes is worth it.

34:56.458 --> 34:58.561
You see, in here,

34:58.628 --> 34:59.961
I'm the boss.

35:00.029 --> 35:03.531
You know about being
the boss, don't you?

35:03.599 --> 35:05.800
[Sobbing]

35:08.970 --> 35:11.405
Get away from me!

35:12.373 --> 35:13.307
No. No, no.

35:13.374 --> 35:14.675
Hmm?

35:14.743 --> 35:17.712
Come on. Come on.

35:17.779 --> 35:21.182
No! No! No--

35:21.249 --> 35:23.983
stop it.

35:25.886 --> 35:27.187
[Gasping]

35:27.254 --> 35:32.525
[Choking]

35:32.593 --> 35:36.096
I taught you everything.

35:36.163 --> 35:42.400
[Choking]

35:46.055 --> 35:47.245
Oh, I can't--

35:47.270 --> 35:49.447
my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

35:49.743 --> 35:52.177
It's like we're cursed
or something.

35:52.245 --> 35:53.978
I know this is a lot,

35:54.046 --> 35:56.848
and we're here to help you
however we can.

35:56.915 --> 36:00.084
Is there anything
I can get you?

36:01.220 --> 36:04.055
3 years ago, Toby
and his 17-year-old sister

36:04.123 --> 36:06.958
were carjacked. The assailant
took them to a remote location

36:07.025 --> 36:08.826
where he repeatedly
raped Toby's sister

36:08.894 --> 36:10.560
and then bludgeoned her
to death.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.295
But he let Toby live.

36:12.363 --> 36:15.132
His mother just told us
that Toby confessed

36:15.199 --> 36:18.701
to not screaming or running
because he actually liked watching.

36:18.770 --> 36:21.138
He said it aroused him.

36:21.205 --> 36:24.107
It was a single-event imprint.
That was his trigger.

36:24.175 --> 36:26.041
Then we're dealing
with two psychopaths.

36:26.109 --> 36:28.310
And if they're both
at the boathouse location,

36:28.378 --> 36:30.880
then neither one of them's
going to go quietly.

36:30.947 --> 36:35.651
[Gasping and choking]

36:35.718 --> 36:38.487
[Sobbing]

36:38.554 --> 36:40.589
Ahh.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.723
Here.

36:42.792 --> 36:43.624
Oh, please.

36:43.692 --> 36:44.725
It's ok.

36:44.794 --> 36:45.994
Oh, please, just
let me go, please.

36:46.061 --> 36:47.495
He's gone now.
It's ok.

36:47.562 --> 36:50.098
It's ok. He's just a--

36:50.166 --> 36:51.599
he's just a hard-headed
little kid.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.935
He didn't know better.

36:54.003 --> 36:56.337
I guess that reflects
poorly on me.

36:56.405 --> 36:59.807
Um...I don't know.

36:59.874 --> 37:02.409
It's just, uh...

37:02.476 --> 37:04.211
Ah, ok.

37:04.279 --> 37:07.314
But he did tell me
what a bitch you were to him.

37:07.381 --> 37:08.949
[Sobbing]

37:09.017 --> 37:12.319
And despite
what you just saw,

37:12.386 --> 37:16.422
I cared very deeply
for that boy.

37:16.489 --> 37:17.489
[Sobbing] No...

37:17.557 --> 37:19.658
So...

37:19.726 --> 37:21.593

right now.

37:28.869 --> 37:31.203
I've been to prison.

37:35.141 --> 37:37.508

This is Agent Hotchner.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.434
Yes, what can I do for you?

38:15.645 --> 38:18.280
Thank you very much.

38:19.115 --> 38:20.482
What is it?

38:20.549 --> 38:24.286
Dallas P.D. discovered
an unidentified male body

38:24.354 --> 38:25.988
with the mouth sewn shut.

38:28.057 --> 38:29.591
Like the silencer.

38:29.658 --> 38:32.127
He's dead.

38:32.195 --> 38:34.362
It's obviously a copycat.

38:34.429 --> 38:37.064
Dallas division is into it.

They said they'd keep us
in the loop.

Hey, pretty boy.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.951
You made it. I like that.

38:58.019 --> 38:59.119
You bring a glove?

38:59.186 --> 39:00.320

about it, kid.
