Yes?

04:13.820 --> 04:16.380
Oh, good morning.
I'd like one of those.

04:17.660 --> 04:18.980
Ah.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.860
Hmm?

04:40.260 --> 04:41.460
Huh?

04:41.540 --> 04:43.900
Oh, okay.

04:43.980 --> 04:46.820
Could you just lay it out
on the floor here?

04:46.900 --> 04:50.140
- That'd be nice.
Floor?

04:50.220 --> 04:52.180
- Very well.
- Thank you.

04:52.260 --> 04:55.340
