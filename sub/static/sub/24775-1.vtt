00:17.240 --> 00:19.680
- Where is she?
- Fuck!

00:20.560 --> 00:24.760
- The exam is in 30 seconds!
- It's not like her to be late.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.520
- Hi. Are they up there?
- Yes.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.520
- Cool! What did you get?
- We got a B!

00:29.600 --> 00:32.040
Great! Excuse me.

00:32.119 --> 00:35.440
- She'll be here.
- What do we do? We're all gonna flunk.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.920
- Seriously.
- Are you ready?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.560
Two minutes. I have to... take a crap.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.600
Two minutes or you'll have to take
the exam again.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.320
Fuck.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
Hey.

01:01.320 --> 01:04.920
- What's going on, Simone?
- We'll make it.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.080
- We've got lots of time.
- Can I see?

01:07.560 --> 01:12.480
I've just changed it a bit and indicated
who says what. It's not hard.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.560
You take the presentation.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.240
You're insane.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.920
Simone, you're awesome.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.840
What do I talk about? I don't get it.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.480
You talk about the water. Easy-peasy.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.840
- Just say what it says.
- Simone, we owe you a million.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.040
And a date.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.280
Tonight?

01:39.120 --> 01:41.960
- You'd better pass then.
- Deal.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.520
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.320
- Isn't that your dad?
- Simone!

01:50.280 --> 01:51.360
Simone!

01:52.360 --> 01:53.360
Dad!

01:54.280 --> 01:57.000
Come here.
Why didn't you answer your phone?

01:57.080 --> 01:59.280
- Dad, I've got an exam.
- This is serious.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.400
Go home and stay there.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.320
Come. Come on.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.080
- But we've got a group exam.
- We're up next.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.760
How am I gonna pass now?

02:06.840 --> 02:09.039
Mom and Rasmus are in the car.

02:10.479 --> 02:11.840
Dad, what's going on?

02:11.920 --> 02:14.520
It's gonna rain,
and we can't be here when it starts.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.480
- Rain?
- I don't have time to explain.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.320
- Sten, I'll look at it when I'm there.
- Dad, what's going on?

02:21.400 --> 02:24.720
- Take it easy, Simone. Dad's talking.
- Why did you come get me like that?

02:24.800 --> 02:28.320
What rain is he talking about?
The sun's shining.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.800
- What's the rush?
- We'll be there soon.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.960
- We'll make it in time.
- Dad, you're crazy!

02:34.040 --> 02:36.480
- Hang up.
- I'll call when we're safe.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.800
Where are we going?

02:38.160 --> 02:39.280
Don't do that.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.480
- I'm looking for my marker.
- Please hang up.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.920
- Damn right it's serious.
- Don't take it off.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.560
I don't know how far it will spread.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.760
- What the hell?
- Keep your eye on the road.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.880
- Don't take off your seat belt, Rasmus.
- What's up?

02:55.960 --> 03:00.760
- I'll glue you to your seat if you do it.
- Let me find it.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.480
<i>Breaking news:
People in Vordingborg are experiencing</i>

03:03.560 --> 03:09.120
<i>acute allergic reactions
and respiratory problems.</i>

03:09.200 --> 03:13.360
<i>Eyewitnesses report that the symptoms
appeared after heavy rainfall...</i>

03:19.480 --> 03:21.000
Don't, Rasmus!

03:21.080 --> 03:24.560
- Is that what we're running from?
- Help your brother buckle up.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.480
- Simone, now!
- But he won't do it!

03:28.560 --> 03:32.120
- Sit down.
- Rasmus, put that seat belt on now.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.680
Dad, watch out!

03:48.200 --> 03:50.240
Are you okay? Did anything happen?

03:51.400 --> 03:53.080
- Are you all right?
- Move your car!

03:53.160 --> 03:54.600
Where to?

03:54.680 --> 03:57.400
If you don't move it, we'll all die!

03:57.920 --> 03:58.760
What do you mean?

03:58.840 --> 04:00.360
Is the rain dangerous?

04:00.440 --> 04:04.440
<i>More deaths have been reported
after the rainfall over Vordingborg.</i>

04:04.520 --> 04:09.120
<i>Everyone is advised to go indoors.
If you are in the Vordingborg area...</i>

04:10.800 --> 04:13.680
Get in. They say the rain's dangerous.

04:13.760 --> 04:14.920
Get in!

04:18.360 --> 04:20.959
We need to find shelter. Now.
We have to get out of here.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.640
Get out of the car!

04:25.760 --> 04:29.240
- Why is the rain dangerous?
- Don't turn around. Go!

04:34.320 --> 04:36.160
Hey, what's going on?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.320
Dad!

04:38.440 --> 04:40.880
- We can't stay here, Simone.
- What about the others?

04:40.960 --> 04:43.760
We can't help anyone until we're safe.
Come on!

04:44.440 --> 04:45.440
Simone!

04:57.040 --> 04:58.640
How far do we have to run?

04:59.120 --> 05:00.120
Hurry!

05:00.200 --> 05:02.880
- Where are we going?
- Run! We're almost there.

05:03.400 --> 05:07.120
- I can't go on. How far is it?
- Come, Simone. Come, sweetie.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.000
- Stop that. We're almost there.
- Come on.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.280
Apollon has a safe place.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.800
What is this place?

05:30.880 --> 05:32.360
Is it your work?

05:36.880 --> 05:38.000
Get in.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
Get inside.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.400
Go, go, go!

05:55.000 --> 05:57.960
- Dad, I'm scared.
- Don't be.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.480
This is the safest place we can be.
Stand still while you're cleansed.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.400
Cleansed?

06:02.480 --> 06:04.520
No illnesses can enter this place.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.480
Apollon built these bunkers
for catastrophes. It's got everything.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.480
Catastrophes?

06:15.240 --> 06:17.120
We don't know how serious this is.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.520
I don't want to be here.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.040
Don't worry, sweetie, we'll go home soon.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.520
The manual.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.600
- All the information about this place.
- How long will you be gone?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.760
- You know I don't know that.
- Gone?

06:29.920 --> 06:33.080
Mom? Mom, what is this place?

06:37.280 --> 06:39.760
Where's Dad going?
What are they talking about?

06:40.360 --> 06:41.360
I don't know.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.200
- Mom will look after you.
- But where are you going?

06:51.760 --> 06:55.120
- There's something I need to do.
- For how long?

06:55.200 --> 06:58.400
- Dad has to go get something.
- But didn't you just say...?

06:58.480 --> 07:02.320
Dad doesn't know for how long,
but he'll be back as soon as he can.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.680
Dad, you can't just go.

07:08.000 --> 07:08.840
Dad...

07:08.920 --> 07:11.200
Come on, sweetie,
let's see what's in the kitchen.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.760
You're old enough to hear this.

07:15.600 --> 07:20.120
There's something in the rain.
A virus that kills people.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.680
- It's worse than you can imagine.
- What?

07:23.760 --> 07:26.720
I'm the only one who can fix this.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.960
I can prevent everyone from dying.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.520
- But what's going to happen to you?
- Nothing's going to happen to me.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.040
You have to be strong for Rasmus.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.760
Nothing can happen to him.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.400
It's your responsibility
to protect your little brother.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.800
- I don't understand.
- No one can find Rasmus.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.920
He's the key to it all.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.280
What is it with him?

07:55.360 --> 07:56.360
Protect him.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.800
Nobody knows you're here.
You're safe here.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.680
I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.520
Dad.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.080
<i>Please help.
We don't know what's going on.</i>

08:26.480 --> 08:28.280
<i>People are dying outside.</i>

08:31.480 --> 08:32.480
<i>Help!</i>

08:33.840 --> 08:34.679
No.

08:34.760 --> 08:38.840
<i>More than 100 deaths in Næstved.
It's happening in Vordingborg, too.</i>

08:38.919 --> 08:39.760
STAY INSIDE

08:39.840 --> 08:40.679
No.

08:40.760 --> 08:44.640
<i>We aren't allowed to go outside
or talk to anyone who's been outside...</i>

08:44.720 --> 08:47.320
stay inside, so nothing happens

08:47.400 --> 08:48.240
<i>Mom?</i>

08:48.320 --> 08:50.520
Sirens are blaring,
this is NOT an exercise

08:54.160 --> 08:55.840
Why are all these weird things here?

08:55.920 --> 08:57.320
It's a place from Dad's work.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.200
Why is there an underground bunker?

08:59.920 --> 09:02.080
Because we're safe
from the rain down here.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.400
- Would you like a cup of cocoa, sweetie?
- Why aren't you nervous?

09:07.320 --> 09:08.680
What's up with the rain?

09:08.760 --> 09:10.360
Don't worry about it.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.360
I'm looking out for you.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.920
Hey, don't think about all that stuff.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.360
I don't like it here.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.120
Let's just have a nice time.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.840
Mom's making hot cocoa.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.960
There's nothing to be afraid of.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.920
Can Dad's suit withstand the rain?

09:56.320 --> 09:57.320
Is that Dad?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.280
It can't be Dad.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.720
Dad can let himself in.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.080
Who else would it be?

10:03.160 --> 10:06.280
- We have to open the door.
- What if he can't open the door?

10:07.640 --> 10:09.120
It's really dangerous.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.240
- But...
- It's not Dad.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.400
He won't be back anytime soon.

10:28.840 --> 10:29.840
Dad?

10:30.920 --> 10:32.560
No. Come back!

10:39.560 --> 10:40.640
No!

10:43.640 --> 10:44.640
Help!

10:45.880 --> 10:48.480
- Mom!
- No! Come back!

10:48.560 --> 10:49.760
No, don't!

10:50.720 --> 10:51.720
Let go of him!

10:52.400 --> 10:53.760
No, don't!

10:54.440 --> 10:55.560
Let go of me!

11:15.360 --> 11:16.760
Mom!

11:16.840 --> 11:18.040
Go inside!

11:19.280 --> 11:20.640
Go inside!

11:20.720 --> 11:21.800
Mom!

11:22.280 --> 11:25.000
Mom? Mom, come back inside!

11:25.080 --> 11:26.760
- Wait for Dad!
- Mom.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.440
Come back!

11:32.880 --> 11:34.200
No! Mom!

11:46.120 --> 11:47.120
Mom!

11:56.760 --> 11:57.760
Mom...

12:10.920 --> 12:14.360
Dad, come on. Please pick up.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.600
Please!

12:53.320 --> 12:54.320
I can't...

12:55.480 --> 12:56.480
I can't...

12:56.520 --> 12:59.840
I can't do this without you. Please.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.200
I can't do this without you.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.400
Please come back.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.520
I never should have opened the door.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.400
Help!

13:19.240 --> 13:20.880
Help!

13:57.000 --> 13:58.240
<i>Do it now.</i>

13:59.000 --> 14:00.040
<i>We're not ready.</i>

14:00.400 --> 14:02.920
<i>By the time you're ready, he'll be dead.</i>

14:03.000 --> 14:06.800
Do it now, Frederik.
The calculations say it works.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.360
I won't inject my son with something
I haven't researched thoroughly.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.840
No, but you know everything
there is to know. You have to try.

14:15.200 --> 14:19.160
- We don't know if it's a mutagen.
- Are we afraid that it'll kill him?

14:19.240 --> 14:20.640
He's dying!

14:20.720 --> 14:23.960
All the calculations say it works.
You showed me the simulations.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.920
- But they're simulations.
- That simulate reality!

14:28.600 --> 14:30.040
Do it now, Frederik.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.120
We need to get hold of Dad...

14:40.160 --> 14:42.720
and he'll be here
as soon as he works this out.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.280
How do we get hold of him?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.680
Your phone doesn't work.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.840
Cool.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.480
There are other bunkers.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.880
- If there are other bunkers...
- Are there people in them?

15:33.000 --> 15:38.320
We'll find out. There must be some way
of connecting to the other bunkers.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.960
We have a connection to the other bunkers.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.040
Is Dad there?

15:44.520 --> 15:45.880
Maybe.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.080
Name. Connect.

15:49.280 --> 15:54.360
Come on. There must be other people
in the bunkers.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.280
Think they're gonna answer?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.040
Come on.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.160
- Doesn't it work?
- Come on!

16:12.280 --> 16:14.840
Shit! Why does it have to be
so fucking hard?

16:17.320 --> 16:22.360
There must be some standard way
of communication.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.120
- A phone or...
- A walkie-talkie?

16:26.440 --> 16:28.200
Yeah, exactly. Something.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.440
They must have thought of something.

16:34.160 --> 16:38.280
If you live in a bunker, there must be...

16:38.920 --> 16:42.200
a walkie-talkie.
Yes, that's a brilliant idea.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.280
Or a phone.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.560
Or WiFi.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.120
Rasmus?

16:53.160 --> 16:54.160
Yes.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.560
- Rasmus?
- Yes.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.480
- What happened?
- I thought it was a walkie-talkie.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.119
I really hope not.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.160
This isn't a walkie-talkie.
It's a vacuum cleaner.

17:20.920 --> 17:21.920
Get down.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.440
Research kit...

17:33.640 --> 17:36.960
And here... mobile field com.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.520
It's a radio!

17:50.520 --> 17:51.760
Thank you.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.440
No battery.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.720
Does it work?

17:55.960 --> 17:57.000
We'll make it work.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.120
Okay. Anything?

18:02.880 --> 18:04.960
Okay, it's working.

18:06.440 --> 18:07.440
Hello?

18:08.400 --> 18:09.680
- Hello?
- Anyone?

18:09.760 --> 18:10.760
Not yet.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.200
Hello?

18:14.000 --> 18:14.840
<i>Hello?</i>

18:14.920 --> 18:17.240
Hello! Say something if you hear me.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.920
Hello! Come in!

18:20.560 --> 18:23.880
<i>- Hello.
- Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

18:23.960 --> 18:25.320
<i>- What?
- Is it Dad?</i>

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
We can hear you.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.320
<i>What? Hello!</i>

18:28.400 --> 18:29.280
Hello.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.840
<i>- I can barely...
- Are you there?</i>

18:34.560 --> 18:36.680
I made contact before. Come on.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.360
They can't hear you.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.800
We have to get
a better connection, Rasmus.

18:44.880 --> 18:48.000
- Go place the antenna close to the door.
- I'm not going outside.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.920
Not outside, but as far as you can.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.440
We need to establish a connection.
You can do it.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.640
That's it.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.080
That's it. Hello?

19:01.160 --> 19:05.000
A bit more. It's getting better now.
Go up the steps.

19:08.520 --> 19:12.640
A bit more. A bit more, Rasmus.
It's getting better. Can you hear me now?

19:14.240 --> 19:15.320
<i>I hear you.</i>

19:15.400 --> 19:17.320
It's working. Come back, Rasmus.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.520
<i>Hello?</i>

19:21.600 --> 19:23.080
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Yes.</i>

19:24.440 --> 19:26.320
Okay, you've got to help us.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.000
My name's Simone,
and I'm with my brother Rasmus

19:30.080 --> 19:31.960
in a bunker.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.680
What's your name?

19:34.560 --> 19:35.680
<i>My name is Philip.</i>

19:36.080 --> 19:37.760
Philip.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.960
We're in an underground bunker.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.080
We don't know what's going on.
What's going on outside?

19:45.800 --> 19:49.520
<i>My parents are freaking out upstairs.
I'm in the basement.</i>

19:50.000 --> 19:51.320
<i>They're going crazy.</i>

19:51.400 --> 19:56.760
<i>Someone's trying to fix it.
It's some illness carried by the rain.</i>

19:56.840 --> 19:59.520
<i>I don't know. Someone's trying to set up
pick-up locations,</i>

19:59.600 --> 20:02.400
<i>but I don't know how far we have to go
to get away from this.</i>

20:02.480 --> 20:07.640
Philip, our mom's dead,
and we can't get in touch with our dad.

20:07.720 --> 20:10.040
We can't call him. We can't reach him.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.040
We have to get in touch with him.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.080
Can you call him?

20:17.160 --> 20:20.280
<i>Call? I think the network's down,
but give me his number.</i>

20:20.360 --> 20:22.960
20067849.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.920
His name is Frederik Andersen.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.360
<i>I'll try, but the world is crazy out here.
I need a few hours.</i>

20:30.320 --> 20:32.280
- Thank you.
<i>- It's crazy out here.</i>

20:34.600 --> 20:36.400
We'll get hold of him, Rasmus.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.520
You're tired, sweetie.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.400
Let's go to bed.

21:04.880 --> 21:08.120
<i>I won't inject my son with something
I haven't researched thoroughly.</i>

21:09.120 --> 21:13.840
<i>No, but you know everything
there is to know. You have to try.</i>

21:30.840 --> 21:31.840
Rasmus?

21:50.760 --> 21:51.760
Rasmus.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.120
What are you doing?

21:56.520 --> 21:57.560
I'm looking for Dad.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.120
- What?
- There was someone here.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.040
- Don't get up at night.
- Dad was here.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.880
It was just a dream, sweetie.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.680
He stood there looking at me.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.160
Yeah, okay.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.040
If he'd been here,
he'd have taken us with him.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.480
He wouldn't just leave.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.720
No, but...

22:28.880 --> 22:30.920
Come on, sweetie.
You have to go back to bed.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.920
I'll find you, Dad.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.080
I have to find you.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.040
Understand?

22:55.960 --> 22:57.120
I have to find you.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.800
<i>Hello?</i>

23:01.840 --> 23:04.280
<i>Simone?</i>

23:04.360 --> 23:05.960
- Hello?
<i>- Hello? Come in.</i>

23:06.040 --> 23:09.040
- Philip? Can you hear me?
<i>- Simone? Yes, I can hear you.</i>

23:09.120 --> 23:10.600
Did you get hold of my dad?

23:10.680 --> 23:13.120
<i>No, there's no connection.</i>

23:14.560 --> 23:18.440
<i>I'm not going outside.
People get ill and die.</i>

23:18.520 --> 23:21.440
<i>You say that you're in Vordingborg, right?</i>

23:21.520 --> 23:24.360
<i>There's a pick-up location
at the hospital.</i>

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
<i>They're evacuating people
and registering survivors.</i>

23:28.080 --> 23:30.240
<i>They must know where your dad is.</i>

23:31.200 --> 23:35.760
Yes... A hospital you said? Here?

23:36.400 --> 23:40.560
- I can get there.
<i>- No, it's too dangerous to go outside.</i>

23:40.640 --> 23:42.560
<i>I'll try to contact them...</i>

23:46.840 --> 23:47.720
Hello?

23:47.800 --> 23:49.760
<i>- General power outage.
- Philip?</i>

23:50.080 --> 23:51.560
<i>- Total shutdown.
- Are you there?</i>

23:51.640 --> 23:55.120
- Hello?
<i>- Emergency generator initializing.</i>

23:55.200 --> 23:57.560
No! Come on. Can you hear me?

23:57.640 --> 23:59.880
Can you hear me?

24:03.440 --> 24:04.440
Rasmus.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.840
Sweetie, wake up.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.360
Sweetie.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.640
- Hey.
- What's up?

24:15.400 --> 24:20.480
Rasmus, the man on the radio
said there's a hospital.

24:20.880 --> 24:24.800
It's not far from here.
They have a pick-up location there.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.160
They'll know where Dad is.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.600
Are you going out there?

24:30.680 --> 24:32.880
Yes. It's our only chance to find Dad.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.680
Can't you send the man on the radio?

24:37.240 --> 24:40.440
No, the radio doesn't work anymore.
The power has gone off outside.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.400
Don't go. Mom died out there.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.400
Rasmus, I'll be okay.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.400
I'll wear the suit.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.960
I don't want to be alone here.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.880
I'll be back.

24:55.960 --> 24:59.240
- It's too dangerous for you to go.
- Why isn't it dangerous for you?

24:59.320 --> 25:00.320
Rasmus...

25:01.200 --> 25:05.480
- I want to wear a suit, too.
- They're too big for you.

25:05.560 --> 25:10.920
- I don't want you to go.
- Rasmus, we have to find Dad.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.280
- Don't do it. No.
- I have to.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.520
- Rasmus...
- No!

25:18.280 --> 25:21.000
Okay.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.440
I'll stay here.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.480
- You can't do it. You can't do it.
- Okay.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.240
<i>No one can find Rasmus.</i>

25:33.000 --> 25:35.440
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Don't.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.520
<i>He's the key to it all.</i>

26:02.520 --> 26:03.560
Are you ready?

26:04.360 --> 26:06.520
The simulations are the same.

26:07.880 --> 26:12.040
I'm going to inject 100 mg now
and 100 again in an hour.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.600
The virus should activate
within five minutes.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.840
We ought to see results within ten.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.800
No, I'm not doing it at the hospital.
They won't allow it.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.240
Yes. Yes, we'll show them
the results if...

26:32.920 --> 26:33.920
if it works.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.520
I'm the only one who can fix this.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.160
<i>I can prevent everyone from dying.</i>

28:03.360 --> 28:04.920
<i>Nothing can happen to him.</i>

28:06.680 --> 28:09.680
<i>It's your responsibility
to protect your little brother.</i>

28:09.760 --> 28:13.160
<i>I'm sorry. I'll do as you say.</i>

28:14.680 --> 28:15.720
<i>We won't go up.</i>

28:16.120 --> 28:20.000
<i>But then you have to keep your promise.
Come back.</i>

28:20.080 --> 28:22.240
<i>Fix all this. Okay?</i>

28:30.720 --> 28:33.480
I'm just so afraid
that there's only me and Rasmus now.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.680
Just the two of us.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.840
But I'll...

28:40.880 --> 28:42.200
I'll look after him.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.040
Why are we planting this?

28:53.560 --> 28:56.400
Don't you think things
are supposed to grow here?

29:01.360 --> 29:02.360
Simone?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.480
How long do we have to stay here?

29:05.560 --> 29:08.160
We'll have to wait for Dad.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.640
When is he coming back?

29:10.920 --> 29:12.800
Well, Rasmus, soon.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.240
And then will everything be okay?

29:16.920 --> 29:18.680
Yes, then everything will be okay.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.320
It's not nice down here.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
No.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.320
That's why we have to make it nice, right?

29:33.160 --> 29:34.280
How?

29:36.080 --> 29:38.200
How? Well, we'll...

29:39.400 --> 29:41.120
We'll turn this place into our own.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.680
And then what?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.200
We'll find out then.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.000
Promise me that Dad will come back?

29:57.040 --> 29:58.040
Yes.

29:59.680 --> 30:00.680
I promise.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.720
Why aren't you eating your food?

30:15.240 --> 30:16.280
I don't like it.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.600
You have to eat it anyway.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.280
You're not my mom.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.200
Oh, come on.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.280
I'm not dancing.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.600
See, there's cake.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.120
11 YEARS OLD

33:24.160 --> 33:26.360
<i>Promise me that Dad will come back.</i>

33:27.040 --> 33:28.280
<i>Yes. I promise.</i>

33:46.360 --> 33:47.680
This is stupid.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.240
- What is?
- That you're shaving me.

33:51.920 --> 33:52.960
Wanna try?

33:53.760 --> 33:55.640
No. I don't have a beard.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.920
No, but you have fuzz. Don't they say you
get a beard once you've shaved the fuzz?

34:03.880 --> 34:05.200
Why did you lie?

34:07.440 --> 34:08.440
About what?

34:09.199 --> 34:10.800
About when we're leaving here.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.760
I didn't lie. We're still waiting.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.000
It's been five years.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.280
- Yes, but Dad...
- Dad's not coming.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.760
He's probably dead.

34:20.920 --> 34:21.920
Mom's dead.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.679
- And we'll die, too.
- No.

34:25.159 --> 34:26.159
Yes.

34:26.520 --> 34:30.120
You pretend everything's okay,
but we're running out of food.

34:31.120 --> 34:34.360
We're waiting for him to return.
He said he'd come back.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.440
He said...

34:42.920 --> 34:44.159
I want to get out of here.

34:47.080 --> 34:50.239
<i>Rasmus is right.
We're running out of food.</i>

34:51.159 --> 34:52.600
<i>We can't stay here any longer.</i>

34:54.639 --> 34:55.840
I'm going outside now.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.160
<i>I have to see what's out there
before I take Rasmus with me.</i>

35:03.760 --> 35:05.320
<i>I promise to take care of him.</i>

35:06.800 --> 35:10.680
If there's nothing out there,
we'll head for the next bunker.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.360
RASMUS, DON'T GO OUT! WAIT!

37:04.720 --> 37:08.040

<i>The world is sick. I can stop it.</i>

38:42.880 --> 38:45.320
- We can save millions.
- What do you mean?

38:50.880 --> 38:53.600
The world is sick. I can stop it.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.000
It's a virus.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.880
<i>You don't know the consequences.</i>

38:59.240 --> 39:00.400
Hello?

39:00.480 --> 39:01.880
We can save millions.

39:03.160 --> 39:05.600

- That's insane.

You don't know how it'll change the world.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.240
<i>He's the key.</i>

39:17.320 --> 39:19.120
<i>- If you're wrong?
- What is it with him?</i>

39:20.920 --> 39:22.520
<i>You don't know the consequences.</i>

39:23.640 --> 39:25.600
<i>It kills multi-resistant bacteria.</i>

39:28.560 --> 39:30.320
<i>We can save millions.</i>

39:30.800 --> 39:32.080
<i>What do you mean?</i>

<i>That's insane.</i>

39:50.320 --> 39:51.320
Simone!

40:10.680 --> 40:12.560
Why didn't you turn off your alarm?

40:15.480 --> 40:16.560
Rasmus...

40:18.360 --> 40:20.080
we can't stay here.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.320
- What?
- We leave tomorrow.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.840
What do you mean?

40:28.280 --> 40:29.280
Listen...

40:31.160 --> 40:33.800
- There's nothing out there.
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

40:33.880 --> 40:36.960
Dad told me to look after you
and to protect you,

40:37.040 --> 40:39.320
but I can't protect you against it...

40:39.840 --> 40:41.280
because there's nothing.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.600
You went outside?

40:43.680 --> 40:46.600
It sucks.
There's nothing out there for us.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.200
There's no one out there. Everyone's gone.

40:49.280 --> 40:55.040
I'm sorry, but all we can do
is head for the next bunker.

40:55.120 --> 40:59.160
And then we'll be locked up down there,
but that's all I can do.

40:59.600 --> 41:03.160
Sweetie, I can't do anything. I can't...

41:04.000 --> 41:06.040
I can't do it alone.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.560
Look...

41:09.240 --> 41:11.520
you're not alone.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.120
I'm here, too.

41:18.800 --> 41:19.800
Okay?

41:21.400 --> 41:23.360
You don't have to look after me anymore.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.320
We look after each other now.

41:39.560 --> 41:44.320
I just want to see the sky again.
Just for five minutes.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.200
Tomorrow?

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Yes.

42:03.240 --> 42:04.320
Tomorrow?

42:04.400 --> 42:05.560
Yes, Rasmus.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.840
We're in this together.

42:24.600 --> 42:25.880
It's just the two of us.

43:14.720 --> 43:15.720
Simone!

43:17.360 --> 43:20.080
Simone! We can't breathe down here!

43:34.520 --> 43:35.760
How do you open this?

43:38.600 --> 43:39.600
Simone!

43:42.560 --> 43:43.560
How do you open this?

43:45.440 --> 43:46.440
Come on!

43:50.320 --> 43:52.480
Why isn't it working? Open up!

43:53.720 --> 43:56.840
<i>Emergency override. Opening doors.</i>

43:57.640 --> 44:00.760
<i>Emergency override. Opening doors.</i>

44:55.680 --> 44:57.400
We did it. We got them out!

45:01.680 --> 45:02.760
Rasmus.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.040
Who are those people?

45:12.640 --> 45:14.920
Stay there! Stay!

45:15.520 --> 45:17.600
- Get inside!
- We won't do anything!

45:19.240 --> 45:21.360
Go. Get inside! Come on. Get inside!

45:21.760 --> 45:22.760
All the way in!

45:23.840 --> 45:24.840
Close it!

45:25.305 --> 45:31.622
