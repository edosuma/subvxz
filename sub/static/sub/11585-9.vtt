(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.808 --> 00:11.145
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.481
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.514 --> 00:15.649
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.683 --> 00:17.185
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.218 --> 00:19.153
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.255
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.525
[woman's voice echoing]
I CAN STILL SMELL HIM.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.427
THE BURNING DIESEL CRAP.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.262
HE SAID WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A SLUT...

00:28.296 --> 00:31.199
[normal voice]
BETWEEN A SLUT AND A BITCH?

00:31.232 --> 00:33.334
A SLUT WILL SCREW ANYTHING,

00:33.367 --> 00:35.403
AND A BITCH WILL SCREW
ANYTHING BUT YOU.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.509
AND THEN HE WAS IN ME.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.213
DIDN'T EVEN TAKE OFF
HIS KEVLAR.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.816
HE VIOLATED YOU,
ROCHELLE.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.351
IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.086
YEAH.
[sniffles]

00:52.120 --> 00:54.355
BUT I WAS THE ONE
THAT HAD TO HIT THE HEAD

00:54.388 --> 00:56.190
FOR SNEAKING BEER,

00:56.224 --> 00:57.225
AND I WAS THE ONE
WITHOUT MY M4.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.227
I HAD MINE,
AND I STILL GOT RAPED.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.562
WELL, THEN, YOU SHOULD HAVE
KILLED THAT BASTARD, KAYLA.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.197
I'M ALWAYS STRAPPED NOW.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.866
YOU...

01:05.899 --> 01:09.103
YOU CAN'T CARRY
A CONCEALED WEAPON.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.604
IF YOU GET CAUGHT,
YOU'LL GO TO PRISON.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.106
[laughs]

01:12.140 --> 01:14.442
SOUNDS BETTER
THAN GETTIN' RAPED.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.280
WELL, THEN I THINK
WE SHOULD END HERE.

01:19.313 --> 01:23.317
KEEP WRITING IN YOUR JOURNALS,
AND REMEMBER TO BREATHE.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.255
HI. I NEED YOU
TO OPEN YOUR JACKET.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.422
GET OFF ME.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.757
THIS IS A SAFE PLACE.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.226
EVERYTHING THAT IS SAID
IN SESSION IS CONFIDENTIAL.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.261
OKAY.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.229
YOU ARE A CLIENT HERE,
OLIVIA.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.063
AND I AM A COP,

01:36.096 --> 01:38.732
AND I CANNOT LET YOU
LEAVE WITH A GUN.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.705
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

01:44.738 --> 01:47.308
IF THERE ARE ANY BODIES
ON THIS GUN,

01:47.341 --> 01:48.509
YOU ARE GONNA BE
IN DEEP.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.445
NOW, I DON'T WANT THAT.
DO YOU?

01:53.314 --> 01:55.316
I JUST WANNA FEEL SAFE
AGAIN.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.189
GO HOME.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.394
MY OFFICE.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.432
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ADDRESSING

02:11.465 --> 02:14.368
YOUR ANXIETY
FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.204
I PUT YOU WITH THESE WOMEN

02:16.237 --> 02:17.671
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THE SAME MINDSET.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.308
AND IF YOU KNEW THAT ROCHELLE
RODRIGUEZ WAS CARRYING,

02:20.341 --> 02:21.875
YOU SHOULD HAVE
REPORTED IT.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.444
I HAD MY SUSPICIONS.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.513
NO ONE WOULD TRUST ME
IF I FRISKED THEM.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.515
AND I HAD PROBABLE CAUSE.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.217
YOU CROSSED THE LINE,
OLIVIA.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.819
WHEN WE'RE IN SESSION,
YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR JOB ASIDE.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.455
NOT IF THEY BREAK THE LAW.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.690
OLIVIA.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.627
ONE OF MY PATIENTS
IS MISSING.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.662
SHE COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.967
JESSIE CREWES.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.538
SHE WENT AWOL
FROM CHERRY POINT A MONTH AGO.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.972
SHE HEARD THAT I WAS DOING

02:52.005 --> 02:53.974
PRO BONO WORK
WITH MILITARY RAPE VICTIMS,

02:54.007 --> 02:56.677
AND SHE CAME HERE
FOR THERAPY.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.612
SO FILE
A MISSING PERSON'S REPORT.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.249
I CAN'T DO THAT.
THEY'D PUT HER IN THE BRIG.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.049
MARGO, SO WILL I.

03:02.082 --> 03:05.253
IF I FIND HER,
I HAVE TO ARREST HER.

03:05.286 --> 03:09.223
SHE WAS RAPED SEVEN MONTHS AGO
BY A FELLOW MARINE.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.791
SHE'S PREGNANT, OLIVIA.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.595
SHE'S HAVING
HER RAPIST'S BABY?

03:18.399 --> 03:20.501
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

03:20.534 --> 03:21.769
THREE DAYS AGO.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.872
SHE WAS UPSET,
BUT SHE WOULDN'T SAY WHY.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.241
(landlord)
SHE HASN'T BEEN A TENANT
THAT LONG,

03:27.275 --> 03:29.377
BUT YOU'RE THE SECOND PERSON
TO COME LOOKIN' FOR HER.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.678
WHO WAS THE FIRST?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.012
SOME GUY I SAW HER WITH.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.714
THEY WERE HAVING
A PRETTY HEATED ARGUMENT.

03:33.747 --> 03:34.848
WHEN?

03:34.882 --> 03:35.916
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.585
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.487
WHITE GUY,
THIRTIES, MILITARY.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.021
I MEAN, OUT OF UNIFORM,

03:41.054 --> 03:43.391
BUT THE HAIRCUT AND POSTURE
GAVE HIM AWAY.
[cell phone rings]

03:43.424 --> 03:45.826
EXCUSE ME--BENSON.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.628
WHERE?

03:47.661 --> 03:49.763
GREAT.
THANK YOU, FIN.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.565
FIND HER?

03:51.599 --> 03:53.634
WE FOUND HER CAR.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.606
(woman)
I THINK IT'S THIS WAY...YEAH.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.309
HERE IT IS.
TOWED FROM OUTSIDE BATTERY PARK.

04:16.724 --> 04:17.991
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

04:18.025 --> 04:19.560
STAND BACK, PLEASE, MA'AM.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.831
OH...[breathes hard]

04:29.403 --> 04:30.838
[woman whimpering]

04:30.871 --> 04:33.407
[vomiting]

04:33.441 --> 04:35.309
[breathing hard]

04:35.343 --> 04:37.578
UH, MANHATTAN SVU
TO CENTRAL.

04:37.611 --> 04:42.350
I NEED A BUS AND CSU
AT CITY IMPOUND.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.817
HAVE SECTORS CANVASS
ALL HOSPITALS

04:43.851 --> 04:46.320
FOR A SIX- TO EIGHT-WEEK-OLD
PREMATURE NEWBORN.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.822
(male operator)
COPY THAT. AMBER ALERT
PROTOCOLS COMMENCING.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.324
INFANT'S RACE?

04:50.358 --> 04:56.063
THE MOTHER'S CAUCASIAN.
THE FATHER'S...UNKNOWN.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.080
RIGOR'S SET.
T.O.D.'S ABOUT 12 HOURS.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.550
SHE HAS BRUISING
AROUND HER THROAT.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.351
LOOKS LIKE
SHE WAS YOKED.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.121
ONE JAGGED STAB WOUND
TO THE BACK.

05:54.154 --> 05:54.922
ANY WAY THE BABY

05:54.955 --> 05:56.857
COULD HAVE SURVIVED
THE ATTACK?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.125
HOW FAR ALONG WAS SHE?

05:58.158 --> 06:00.761
32, MAYBE 33 WEEKS.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.030
THE LUNGS
AREN'T FULLY DEVELOPED YET,

06:03.063 --> 06:04.998
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT WORRIES ME.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.567
YOU THINK
THE BABY WAS CUT.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.135
I'D BE SURPRISED
IF IT WASN'T.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.103
THE KILLER REALLY HACKED UP
THE WOMB.

06:10.137 --> 06:13.674
I GOT PIECES OF PLACENTA

06:13.707 --> 06:15.876
AND PART OF
THE UMBILICAL CORD.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.712
I'LL RUSH DNA
ON THE CORD BLOOD,

06:18.746 --> 06:20.648
SEE IF WE CAN I.D.
THE FATHER.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.452
DETECTIVE BENSON?

06:24.485 --> 06:25.719
YEAH.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.555
COMMANDER BRENT MARCUS,
JAG CORPS.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.989
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
SO FAR?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.057
WELL, WE'RE JUST
GETTING STARTED.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.526
I'LL SEE YOU COPIES
OF THE RECORDS WHEN WE'RE DONE.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.594
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.195
UH, THIS IS
A CIVILIAN HOMICIDE.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.598
OF AN ACTIVE DUTY
AWOL MARINE.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.099
NOW, WE CAN RUN THE SHOW,

06:39.132 --> 06:41.602
BUT I DON'T SEE
ANY REASON TO INTERFERE

06:41.635 --> 06:43.170
UNLESS YOU GIVE ME ONE.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.072
OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED
THE VICTIM'S MILITARY RECORDS

06:45.105 --> 06:46.707
AND A FILE
ON HER RAPE COMPLAINT.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.842
WHAT DOES THE SEXUAL ASSAULT
HAVE TO DO WITH THE MURDER?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.878
HER KILLER CUT THE BABY
OUT OF THE VICTIM'S WOMB.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.212
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE,
DETECTIVE,

06:52.245 --> 06:55.182
THAT SOME WOMAN TARGETED HER
AND BABY-SNATCHED?

06:55.215 --> 06:56.850
NO WOMAN
CUT HER VICTIM OPEN,

06:56.884 --> 06:58.719
DRAGGED THE BODY,

06:58.752 --> 07:00.688
AND THEN STUFFED IT
INTO THE TRUNK OF HER OWN CAR.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.523
THE ONLY MOTIVE HERE
IS DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.592
NOW, WOMEN IN THE MILITARY
PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE

07:04.625 --> 07:06.927
ONLY TO BE ATTACKED BY
THEIR OWN MEN--LIKE OUR VICTIM.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.095
WHO NEVER I.D.'D
HER RAPIST.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.863
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HIM,

07:09.897 --> 07:11.865
OR BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID
YOU'D DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.934
THAT DOESN'T EVEN
DESERVE A RESPONSE.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.736
IT'S STILL AN OPEN FILE.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.706
WHICH I NEED ACCESS TO
SO I CAN SOLVE HER MURDER.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.173
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.174
AND WHY'S THAT?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.943
BECAUSE SHE WAS RAPED
IN IRAQ,

07:22.976 --> 07:24.878
WHERE THE CRIME SCENE
AND MOST OF HER UNIT

07:24.912 --> 07:27.147
ARE STILL IN THEATER.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.619
HOW LONG
HAS THE INFANT BEEN MISSING?

07:31.652 --> 07:32.953
(Fin)
ABOUT 12 HOURS.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.555
ANY HITS
ON THE AMBER ALERT?

07:34.588 --> 07:36.223
HUNDREDS.
NONE THAT HAVE PANNED OUT.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.125
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE THIS MARINE WAS KILLED?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.260
A LARGE POOL OF BLOOD
WAS FOUND IN BATTERY PARK.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.029
THE LAB'S TESTING IT NOW.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.497
SHE WAS STATIONED
IN NORTH CAROLINA.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.165
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
IN NEW YORK?

07:45.198 --> 07:46.867
SHE WENT AWOL
TO JOIN A THERAPY GROUP

07:46.900 --> 07:48.035
THAT SPECIALIZES IN TREATING

07:48.068 --> 07:50.738
MILITARY RAPE VICTIMS
WITH PTSD.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.172
THAT'S A LONG WAY
TO TRAVEL FOR THERAPY.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.541
IT'S A LONG
WAITIN' LIST,

07:53.574 --> 07:55.275
AND RETURNING VETS
NEED HELP NOW.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.645
HAVE WE TRACKED CREWES'
RECENT MOVEMENTS?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.513
SHE SUBLET AN APARTMENT,
USED ONLY CASH.

07:59.547 --> 08:02.149
WE CANVASSED HER BLOCK.
SHE DIDN'T GO OUT MUCH.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.518
DRUG STORE, CORNER MARKET--
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.153
SHE WAS SEEN ARGUING
WITH AN UNIDENTIFIED MALE

08:06.186 --> 08:07.087
TWO DAYS AGO.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.657
THAT'S WHY I PULLED
SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS

08:09.690 --> 08:11.725
FROM LOCAL ATMs, HOPING
WE'D FIND A STALKER SHADOW.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.761
(Fin)
SOMEONE WAS HUNTING HER.
YOU DUMP HER PHONE?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.262
(Munch)
SEVERAL INCOMING CALLS

08:15.295 --> 08:16.096
FROM A DISPOSABLE CELL PHONE

08:16.129 --> 08:18.098
AND TWO FROM A MIDTOWN
HOTEL PAY PHONE.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.100
YOU RUN 'EM DOWN?
THE HOTEL WAS FULL.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.334
THE PAY PHONES
WERE IN THE LOBBY.

08:21.368 --> 08:24.204
ANYBODY COULD HAVE COME IN OFF
THE STREET TO MAKE THOSE CALLS.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.206
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT?

08:26.239 --> 08:27.074
NEXT TO NOTHING.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.709
SHE WAS RAPED IN IRAQ
AND COULDN'T,

08:28.742 --> 08:31.178
OR WOULDN'T,
IDENTIFY HER ATTACKER.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.213
LET ME GUESS--THE MILITARY
WILL NOT RELEASE AN ACTIVE FILE.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.081
WELL, IF IT HAPPENED
IN-COUNTRY,

08:34.114 --> 08:35.683
IT HAD TO BE SOMEBODY
SHE WORKED WITH.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.284
(Cragen)
WHAT UNIT WAS SHE ASSIGNED TO?

08:37.317 --> 08:39.720
A SQUADRON
IN THE 2ND AIRWING.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.221
MAINTENANCE
ON LIGHT ATTACK HELICOPTERS.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.090
OKAY, THERE'S 15 HELOS
PER SQUADRON.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.192
SO?

08:45.225 --> 08:46.393
COBRA GETS A THREE-MAN
MAINTENANCE TEAM

08:46.426 --> 08:49.262
TO WORK ON ENGINES, NAVI,
WEAPON SYSTEMS, AND ORDNANCE.

08:49.296 --> 08:52.666
PLUS, THERE'S TWO PILOTS
AND A DOOR GUNNER PER BIRD.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.668
THAT'S OVER 75 SUSPECTS.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.003
THEN NARROW IT DOWN.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.337
GO BACK TO THE THERAPIST,

08:57.370 --> 08:59.807
SEE IF THE VICTIM
GAVE HER A NAME.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.578
(Margo)
I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.346
I CAN'T BELIEVE
JESSIE WAS MURDERED.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.181
I'VE BEEN DOING
GRIEF COUNSELING ALL DAY.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.683
WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS

09:09.717 --> 09:11.218
GETTING THE MARINES
TO COOPERATE.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.153
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU?

09:13.186 --> 09:14.855
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT CORPORAL CREWES?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.256
NOTHING.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.159
I GUESS YOU AND THE MILITARY
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.128
DEATH DOESN'T NULLIFY
CONFIDENTIALITY.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.196
HOLD ON, MARGO.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.264
YOU ASKED ME TO FIND HER.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.999
I'M SORRY I GOT YOU
INVOLVED, OLIVIA.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.168
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.169
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR AN APOLOGY, MARGO.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.205
I'M ASKING YOU
FOR YOUR HELP.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.176
THIS WOMAN WAS MURDERED,
AND THEY CUT HER BABY OUT.

09:36.209 --> 09:39.012
NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR YOU
TO HIDE BEHIND CONFIDENTIALITY.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.214
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.284
THEY COULD YANK
MY LICENSE.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.019
(Fin)
WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

09:46.053 --> 09:48.121
TALK TO ONE OF THE PATIENTS
FROM JESSIE'S SUPPORT GROUP.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.723
THE SHRINK WON'T TELL YOU
ABOUT THE RAPE.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.692
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SHE'S
GONNA GIVE UP HER PATIENT LIST?

09:51.725 --> 09:54.728
I DON'T NEED IT.
I ALREADY KNOW WHO TO TALK TO.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.164
DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW
YOU'RE IN THERAPY?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.799
NO.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.734
THEN THEY WON'T
HEAR IT FROM ME.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.109
HEY.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.343
UGH. GO AWAY, BITCH.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.179
SAY THAT TO ME.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.747
ROCHELLE,
I JUST WANNA TALK.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.950
I CAN'T DO THAT.
WE ALL DID TIME IN THE DESERT.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.352
TALKING TO YOU WOULD BE
LIKE BREAKING RANKS.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.921
ARMY?
HU-RAH.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.356
RANGERS. MOGADISHU.
'93.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.058
THAT'S BLACK HAWK DOWN.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.094
I WAS AN MP TURRET GUNNER.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.096
RAN A 50-CAL BELT-FED,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.098
ESCORTING TRUCK CONVOYS
FROM BASE TO BASE.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.766
THAT'S HOW I MET JESS.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.367
YOU KNOW, YOUR SILENCE

10:34.401 --> 10:36.269
IS JUST PROTECTING
HER KILLER.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.271
IF YOU DON'T TALK TO US,

10:38.305 --> 10:40.073
IT'S LIKE HER RAPE
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.379
JESS HAD NIGHT ROTATION.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.415
SHE SAID HE CAME IN THE HANGAR,

10:48.448 --> 10:51.084
LOCKED THE DOOR, AND RAPED HER.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.188
TOOK HER A MONTH
TO REPORT IT.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.423
WHY DID SHE WAIT
SO LONG?

10:56.456 --> 10:58.425
JESSIE GOT CAUGHT
A COUPLE OF MONTHS BEFORE

10:58.458 --> 11:00.694
HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE
IN HER UNIT.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.262
WAS IT CONSENSUAL?
NO SEX IN COMBAT.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.131
YOU GET CAUGHT,
THEY'LL DING YOUR RECORD.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.432
THAT'S WHY SHE THOUGHT
COMMAND

11:05.465 --> 11:07.434
WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THAT SHE'D BEEN RAPED.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.202
BUT THEN SHE TURNED UP
PREGNANT.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.271
SHE SAID SHE HAD
ALL THE EVIDENCE SHE NEEDED

11:11.304 --> 11:12.773
AND FILED.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.107
DID SHE TELL YOU
WHO ATTACKED HER?

11:14.141 --> 11:15.675
NO.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.979
ONLY THAT HE
WAS RANKED ABOVE HER

11:19.012 --> 11:20.981
AND SHE WAS AFRAID
OF RETRIBUTION.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.415
WHAT KIND OF RETRIBUTION?

11:22.449 --> 11:24.251
IF HE WAS AN OFFICER,

11:24.284 --> 11:25.285
HIS MEN COULD JAM HER UP.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.788
EVEN HER OWN UNIT COULD GIVE HER
THE COLD SHOULDER.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.957
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE

11:29.990 --> 11:31.424
TO BE RAPED BY SOME BASTARD

11:31.458 --> 11:34.928
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
WATCHING YOUR SIX!

11:36.163 --> 11:37.965
WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HER RAPIST?

11:37.998 --> 11:40.734
JESSIE WENT AWOL BECAUSE
SHE KNEW HE WAS COMING HOME.

11:40.768 --> 11:45.238
SHE WAS AFRAID
OF WHAT HE WOULD DO.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.940
[Warner, distantly]
VICTIM'S MOTHER KEEPS CALLING.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.909
SHE'S UPSET,
WANTS ANSWERS.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.410
OLIVIA?

11:50.443 --> 11:52.312
[Fin, normal voice]
LIV.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.047
YES?
WHERE'D YOU GO?

11:54.081 --> 11:55.115
OH, I'M SORRY.
GO AHEAD.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.250
THE VICTIM WAS YOKED
AND STABBED FROM BEHIND.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.485
DEATH WAS IMMEDIATE.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.487
SO YOU'RE SAYING THE BABY
WAS TAKEN POST-MORTEM?

12:00.520 --> 12:03.223
YES. THE AMBER ALERTS
HAVE BEEN UPDATED.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.992
I TESTED THE CORD BLOOD
AND PLACENTA

12:05.025 --> 12:07.327
USING DNA ANCESTRY.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.829
YOUR RAPIST
IS CAUCASIAN.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.497
YOU GOT THE HAIR
AND EYE COLOR TOO?

12:10.530 --> 12:13.266
THE ANCESTRY TEST
USES GENETIC MARKERS

12:13.300 --> 12:16.236
THAT TEND TO BE SIMILAR
IN RACIAL GROUPS.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.806
SO CAN'T WE RUN IT AGAINST
THE MILITARY'S DNA BASE?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.473
THAT'S USED TO IDENTIFY
REMAINS.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.475
THEY WON'T GIVE US
ACCESS.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.478
SO WE HAVE NOTHING TO HELP
NARROW DOWN THE SUSPECT POOL.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.380
MAYBE CAUSE OF DEATH
WILL HELP.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.216
THE VICTIM
WAS STABBED ONCE.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.485
THE KNIFE WAS THRUST
UNDER THE RIBCAGE,

12:32.519 --> 12:34.822
THROUGH THE LUNG
AND INTO THE HEART.

12:34.855 --> 12:38.058
THE RIGHT VENTRICLE WAS SHREDDED
WITH A SHARP TWIST OF THE BLADE.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.193
THAT'S A COMBAT MANEUVER
FOR A SILENT KILL.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.162
THE LUNG COLLAPSES
SO THE TARGET CAN'T SCREAM.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.231
DOESN'T THAT REQUIRE
SPECIALIZED TRAINING?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.934
THEY DON'T OFFER ADVANCED
KNIFE FIGHTIN' SKILLS IN BASIC.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.568
I MEASURED THE WOUND TRACT.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.804
THE MURDER WEAPON
IS APPROXIMATELY 7 INCHES LONG

12:50.838 --> 12:52.039
AND NON-SERRATED.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.540
SOUNDS LIKE
A KA-BAR KNIFE TO ME.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.108
THAT COMES
WITH THE UNIFORM.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.210
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
TO GET THE DUTY ROSTER

12:57.244 --> 12:57.945
FOR THE NIGHT
SHE WAS RAPED.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.147
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.117
(Marcus)
I ALREADY SENT THE VICTIM'S
MILITARY RECORDS

13:04.151 --> 13:05.185
TO YOUR PRECINCT.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.153
WHERE'S THE FILE
ON THE RAPE?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.155
THE WITNESS STATEMENTS,
THE SUSPECT LIST,

13:08.188 --> 13:10.590
THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS
THAT WE CAN TALK TO?

13:10.623 --> 13:11.458
THERE ISN'T ONE.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.226
VICTIMS GET TWO REPORTING
OPTIONS--

13:13.260 --> 13:15.428
JESSICA CREWES CHOSE RESTRICTED
OVER NON-RESTRICTED.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.897
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.365
NON-RESTRICTED
GETS THE FULL-COURT PRESS.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.201
RESTRICTED ALLOWS THE VICTIM
TO REPORT THE ASSAULT,

13:21.234 --> 13:23.937
GET MEDICAL
AND COUNSELING TREATMENT,

13:23.971 --> 13:25.238
WITHOUT STARTING
A FORMAL INVESTIGATION.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.940
OH, SO THE RAPIST
GOES FREE

13:26.974 --> 13:28.575
WHILE YOU COVER UP
THE RAMPANT SEXUAL ASSAULT

13:28.608 --> 13:30.110
OF ENLISTED FEMALES?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.244
THE POLICY WAS PUT
IN PLACE

13:31.278 --> 13:33.480
SO THAT VICTIMS WOULD AT LEAST
COME FORWARD AND GET HELP

13:33.513 --> 13:35.282
WITHOUT FEELING
VIOLATED AGAIN.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.616
YOU'RE HELPING RAPISTS
AVOID PRISON.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.118
WE STILL ASK QUESTIONS,
CHECK ALIBIS,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.320
JUST IN CASE THE VICTIM
CHANGES HER MIND.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.289
BUT JUST LIKE YOU,
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE

13:42.322 --> 13:44.124
AND NO WITNESSES.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.893
UNLESS THE SUSPECT
KNOWS HE GOT AWAY WITH IT,

13:45.926 --> 13:47.560
WHAT'S TO PREVENT HIM
FROM ATTACKING THE VICTIM

13:47.594 --> 13:48.561
TO KEEP HER QUIET?

13:48.595 --> 13:50.630
WE TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION
TO MAKE SURE THE VICTIM

13:50.663 --> 13:52.165
DOESN'T SERVE WITH
OR UNDER THE ACCUSED.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.101
WELL, THEN, YOU SCREWED UP,
COMMANDER,

13:54.134 --> 13:55.869
BECAUSE THE AUTOPSY
REPORT SHOWS

13:55.903 --> 13:59.172
THAT JESSIE CREWES WAS BUTCHERED
BY A FELLOW MARINE.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.075
IF THIS IS TRUE, I'M SHUTTING
DOWN YOUR INVESTIGATION.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.877
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.245
SHE WAS MURDERED HERE,
NOT IN FALLUJAH.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.881
THE U.S. MILITARY'S SOVEREIGN,
DETECTIVE.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.349
AND SINCE BOTH THE SUSPECT
AND THE VICTIM

14:09.382 --> 14:11.218
BELONG TO THE ARMED FORCES,

14:11.251 --> 14:14.321
THAT MEANS THAT YOUR WORK
IS DONE HERE.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.462
ADA KIM GRAYLEK.
ANSWER'S NO.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.231
GOOD. I'D LIKE TO KICK
YOUR ASS IN COURT.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.198
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TALKING TO ME?

14:25.232 --> 14:26.333
PUTTING ASIDE MY AMBITION

14:26.366 --> 14:27.667
TO SOLVE THE MURDER
OF A DEAD MARINE.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.236
YOU INTERESTED?
VERY.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.104
THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING OVER
THE INVESTIGATION.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.472
WHICH YOU CAN'T LEGALLY DO.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.341
MILITARY'S SOVEREIGN,
MS. GRAYLEK.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.542
END OF ARGUMENT.
NOT QUITE.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.177
THE VICTIM WAS MURDERED
IN THE CITY.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.278
SHE WAS STABBED
IN BATTERY PARK,

14:38.311 --> 14:39.479
WHICH IS FEDERAL LAND.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.580
NEXT.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.215
TIME OF DEATH
CAN'T BE ESTABLISHED.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.316
YOU SAY SHE DIED
IN THE PARK.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.018
I SAY SHE DIED
IN THE TRUNK OF HER CAR.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.220
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS SHE WAS
MURDERED BY ANOTHER MARINE.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.257
WHO'S UNIDENTIFIED,
AND UNLESS HE'S ON ACTIVE DUTY,

14:50.290 --> 14:52.325
HE'S A CIVILIAN
AND BEYOND YOUR REACH.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.197
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.932
THE DUTY ROSTER
FOR 2ND AIRWING

14:58.966 --> 15:00.433
ON THE NIGHT
CORPORAL CREWES WAS RAPED.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.269
NCIS ALREADY LOOKED
INTO THAT.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.670
WE'LL LOOK AGAIN.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.607
AND I NEED THE CURRENT
WHEREABOUTS

15:07.640 --> 15:10.377
OF EVERY MARINE
IN THE VICTIM'S SQUADRON.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.247
(Benson)
IT'S THE OLDEST TRICK
IN THE BOOK.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.216
MARCUS IS STALLING
BY DROWNING US IN PAPERWORK.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.951
WHY WOULD HE?

15:17.985 --> 15:21.021
BECAUSE THE MILITARY
CAN'T AFFORD ANY MORE BAD PRESS,

15:21.054 --> 15:22.222
LET ALONE LOSING
ANY MORE SOLDIERS.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.624
MARCUS IS RUNNING INTO THE SAME
BRICK WALLS WE DO, LIV.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.260
ANY LEADS
ON JESSIE CREWES' KILLER?

15:27.294 --> 15:29.396
MOST OF THE UNIT'S STILL
DEPLOYED FROM TOUR EXTENSIONS.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.998
BUT THERE WERE FIVE
MARINES ON DUTY

15:31.031 --> 15:32.165
THE NIGHT
THAT SHE WAS RAPED

15:32.199 --> 15:34.234
THAT MATCH THOSE
WHO SHIPPED HOME.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.702
TWO SERGEANTS, A GUNNERY
AND A MASTER SERGEANT,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.237
AND A LIEUTENANT RANK
ABOVE CORPORAL CREWES.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.206
WE HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE THEY ARE?

15:39.239 --> 15:41.341
WELL, WE'VE GOT SERGEANT
KELLY AND MONROE

15:41.374 --> 15:42.542
ARE AT CHERRY POINT,

15:42.575 --> 15:46.046
THE GUNNERY SERGEANT DITKA
AND MASTER SERGEANT PRUITT

15:46.079 --> 15:47.680
HAVE APPROVED LEAVE,

15:47.714 --> 15:50.183
AND LIEUTENANT GARY ROSTEN'S
WHEREABOUTS ARE CLASSIFIED.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.319
EXCUSE ME, I WAS TOLD I COULD
FIND A DETECTIVE BENSON HERE.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.154
I'M DETECTIVE OLIVIA BENSON.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.190
I'M JESSIE'S MOTHER.
WE TALKED ON--

15:58.658 --> 16:00.994
OH, MY GOD--
[hyperventilating]

16:01.028 --> 16:03.496
(Cragen)
PLEASE, THIS WAY.
COME THIS WAY.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.565
MY OFFICE HERE...

16:09.402 --> 16:11.238
MRS. CREWES, I'M...

16:11.271 --> 16:13.773
I'M SO SORRY THAT YOU
HAD TO SEE THAT.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.343
I NEEDED TO SEE IT...

16:16.376 --> 16:18.445
TO MAKE IT REAL.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.217
I HADN'T TALKED TO JESSIE
IN OVER A MONTH.

16:24.251 --> 16:27.087
MPs CAME TO CLEVELAND
LOOKING FOR HER.

16:27.120 --> 16:31.124
THEY WERE SURE
I WAS HIDING HER.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.060
[voice breaking]
I REALLY WISH I WAS.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.766
ARE THERE ANY LEADS
TO HER BABY?

16:41.434 --> 16:44.071
NO.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.374
MY GRANDSON'S DEAD, TOO,
ISN'T HE?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.309
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.678
I HAVE TO FACE FACTS.

16:51.711 --> 16:56.283
I WORRIED ABOUT INSURGENTS
AND ROADSIDE BOMBS.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.219
BUT WHEN...

16:59.252 --> 17:03.090
JESSIE TOLD ME MEN STILL
OUTNUMBER WOMEN TEN TO ONE,

17:03.123 --> 17:08.095
I...I EXPECTED
SOME HARASSMENT,

17:08.128 --> 17:10.597
NOT RAPE.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.436
DID SHE GIVE YOU
ANY DETAILS?

17:16.469 --> 17:20.107
YEAH. SHE CALLED ME
RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENED...

17:20.140 --> 17:23.143
BUT WOULDN'T SAY
WHO ATTACKED HER.

17:24.777 --> 17:28.115
I TOLD HER
TO FILE A COMPLAINT.

17:28.148 --> 17:32.119
BUT JESSIE
WAS ALREADY GETTING HARASSED

17:32.152 --> 17:34.287
AND--AND--AND--

17:34.321 --> 17:35.688
DIDN'T WANT MORE TROUBLE.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.292
WHY WAS SHE
HAVING PROBLEMS?

17:39.326 --> 17:40.727
A SERGEANT LOST A STRIPE

17:40.760 --> 17:43.763
FOR HANGING
AROUND MY DAUGHTER.

17:43.796 --> 17:47.534
SHE SAID
HE WAS A POPULAR GUY,

17:47.567 --> 17:51.238
AND HIS UNIT
BLAMED HER FOR IT.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.473
DID SHE GIVE YOU
HIS NAME?

17:55.842 --> 17:58.678
DOMINIC PRUITT.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.650
NAVY CROSS,
MERITORIOUS SERVICE,

18:03.683 --> 18:05.518
COMBAT ACTION.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.154
THIS LIST
GOES ON AND ON.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.189
(Fin)
HE ENLISTED RIGHT
OUTTA HIGH SCHOOL.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.358
EVERY C.O. I TALKED TO
WANTED TO ADOPT THE GUY.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.194
WELL, PRUITT'S
ABOUT TO SHIP OUT AGAIN.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.128
YOU THINK HE RAPED ANY OTHERS?

18:15.162 --> 18:17.664
(Fin)
THERE'S NO RECORD
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

18:17.697 --> 18:18.765
THAT MEANS NOTHING.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.234
WHEN WOMEN REFUSE TO SERVE
WITH THE MEN WHO RAPE THEM,

18:21.268 --> 18:23.203
THEY GET COURT-MARTIALED
FOR DESERTION,

18:23.236 --> 18:26.239
DERELICTION,
CONDUCT UNBECOMING.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.341
I MEAN, THEIR FILES
GET RED-FLAGGED,

18:28.375 --> 18:30.210
AND THE MEN WHO RAPED THEM
GET A WEEKEND PASS.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.778
HE PASSED A POLYGRAPH,
OLIVIA.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.281
ANY PSYCHO CAN DO THAT.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.782
DO WE KNOW WHERE HE IS?

18:35.815 --> 18:38.351
THE JAG OFF SAID
HE'D GET RIGHT BACK WITH ME,

18:38.385 --> 18:40.453
BUT SINCE I CAN'T HOLD
MY BREATH THAT LONG,

18:40.487 --> 18:42.389
MUNCH'S RUNNIN' HIS CREDIT.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.723
TURNS OUT HE'S RIGHT HERE
IN THE CITY.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.625
HIS CREDIT CARD
HAS HIM REGISTERED

18:45.658 --> 18:47.794
AT A HOTEL IN MIDTOWN.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.068
WHOA, WHOA.

18:56.102 --> 18:59.272
WE SHOULD PROBABLY FIGURE
THE BEST WAY TO TALK TO PRUITT.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.740
PUT HIM IN THE BOX
AND SWEAT HIM.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.376
HE'S NOT LIKE A NORMAL HUMP
WE PICK UP OFF THE STREET.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.845
PRUITT'S NOT JUST GONNA START
SPILLIN' HIS GUTS.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.013
THEY TRAIN HIM NOT TO.

19:07.046 --> 19:10.250
LOOK, HE'S GONNA COOPERATE,
OR HE'S GONNA SIT IN A CELL.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.419
SOUNDS LIKE YOU
ALREADY DECIDED HE'S GUILTY.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.388
'CAUSE THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.424
LOOK, I KNOW
THAT THIS IS DIFFICULT.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.959
I GET DEFENSIVE TOO
EVERY TIME A COP GOES BAD.

19:19.992 --> 19:20.827
IT'S FUNNY.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.462
I JUST NEVER HEARD YOU
PUSH THAT HARD

19:22.495 --> 19:24.631
FOR ONE P.P.
TO CLEAN HOUSE.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.967
[crashing sound]

19:28.000 --> 19:29.869
THIS WAY.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.771
[crashing, clattering]

19:33.340 --> 19:35.242
[beep]
READY?

19:36.243 --> 19:38.278
NYPD! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

19:38.311 --> 19:40.513
FREEZE!
AAH!

19:40.547 --> 19:42.615
I SAID BREAK IT UP!

19:42.649 --> 19:44.617
[glass shatters]
I SAID STOP! STOP!

19:46.653 --> 19:48.255
FREEZE! BACK OFF!
OLIVIA, NO!

19:51.724 --> 19:54.327
[hard breathing echoes]

19:59.666 --> 20:01.368
[cocks pistol]

20:07.407 --> 20:10.377
OLIVIA, ARE YOU OKAY?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.345
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:13.513 --> 20:15.482
EASY, EASY.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.317
EASY.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.690
I'M SORRY.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.359
(woman)
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

20:26.393 --> 20:27.727
STAY RIGHT THERE,
MA'AM.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.697
THAT'S MY HUSBAND, GARY.
HE'S HURT.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.031
HE NEEDS A DOCTOR!
I SAID DON'T MOVE!

20:32.064 --> 20:34.434
[whispering]
I'M SORRY.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.370
TAKE YOUR TIME.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.307
FEEL YOUR FEET
ON THE GROUND.
YEAH.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.708
BREATHE.
[mumbles]

20:41.741 --> 20:44.243
[inhales, exhales]

20:50.650 --> 20:52.585
COME ON, GET UP.
GET UP.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.736
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.604
I CAN'T LET YOU
QUESTION THE SUSPECT.

21:11.638 --> 21:12.905
I'M FINE, FIN.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.874
YOU HELD YOUR GUN
TO THE BACK OF A MAN'S HEAD.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.777
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU'RE IN?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.312
YOU REPORTED ME?

21:19.346 --> 21:21.481
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU
GETTING YOUR HEAD TOGETHER.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.616
I AM WORKING ON IT.
ARE YOU?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.585
SEEMS LIKE YOU EVEN HAVE ISSUES
WITH YOUR SHRINK.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.886
YOU NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.955
THE ONLY PERSON THAT
I'M INTERESTED IN TALKING TO

21:28.988 --> 21:31.558
IS THE MAN THAT RAPED
AND KILLED JESSICA CREWES.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.025
WE NEED TO FIND THAT BABY.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.362
IF I LET YOU DO THIS,
I'M SITTIN' IN.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.629
LOOK, I'M OKAY!

21:36.663 --> 21:38.865
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S EITHER ME OR IT'S CRAGEN.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.567
YOU CHOOSE.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.434
YOU'RE JERKING ME AROUND.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.969
I HAVE BEEN HERE
FOR 45 MINUTES.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.937
I WANT TO SEE
MY HUSBAND!

21:44.971 --> 21:46.706
WHY CAN'T I SEE HIM?

21:46.739 --> 21:47.874
WHERE IS HE?

21:47.907 --> 21:48.808
WHY CAN'T I SEE HIM?

21:48.841 --> 21:51.678
I WANT MY HUSBAND!
WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

21:51.711 --> 21:52.879
MRS. ROSTEN, PLEASE.
GARY!

21:52.912 --> 21:54.881
GARY!
YOU NEED TO RELAX,
MRS. ROSTEN.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.883
I WILL ARREST YOU
IF I HAVE TO.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.018
WHY? WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG,

21:59.051 --> 22:00.887
AND YOU'RE TREATING HIM
LIKE A CRIMINAL!

22:00.920 --> 22:01.788
IT WAS PRUITT'S KNIFE.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.856
MY HUSBAND
WAS JUST DEFENDING HIMSELF.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.659
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
WE JUST WANT A STATEMENT.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.428
WHERE IS GARY?

22:11.431 --> 22:12.432
THIS WAY.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.970
DO YOU KNOW WHY PRUITT
ATTACKED YOUR HUSBAND?

22:18.004 --> 22:19.739
NO.

22:19.772 --> 22:20.907
WHAT HAPPENS
TO ENLISTED MEN

22:20.940 --> 22:23.543
WHO ASSAULT
THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICERS?

22:23.576 --> 22:24.911
A GENERAL COURT-MARTIAL.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.646
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A PRETTY BIG RISK

22:26.679 --> 22:28.848
FOR A LIFER LIKE PRUITT
TO TAKE.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.717
IT HAPPENS.
CAN WE GO NOW?

22:30.750 --> 22:32.819
YOU SEEM PRETTY RATTLED.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.020
MY HUSBAND WAS ATTACKED,

22:34.053 --> 22:35.922
AND YOUR COPS PULLED GUNS.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.057
HOW SHOULD I FEEL?

22:38.090 --> 22:40.092
I'D THINK
YOU'D BE USED TO IT

22:40.126 --> 22:43.029
SINCE YOUR HUSBAND'S WORTH
IS MEASURED BY HIS KILLS.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.931
I'M NOT A MARINE.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.803
(Benson)
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO JESSICA CREWES?

22:50.837 --> 22:52.038
I TRIED CALLING HER
FROM THE HOTEL

22:52.071 --> 22:53.740
WHEN I GOT INTO TOWN,
BUT NO JOY.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.041
NO, I ASKED YOU WHEN.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.743
A WEEK AGO.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.678
AND YOU CALLED HER
FROM THE LOBBY.
YES, MA'AM.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.813
AND WHY'S THAT?
YOU DON'T HAVE A CELL PHONE?

23:00.847 --> 23:03.049
NOT ON LEAVE.
NOT WHEN I DON'T WANNA BE FOUND.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.084
WHY WERE YOU
TRYING TO REACH HER?

23:05.117 --> 23:07.720
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS OKAY.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.822
ISN'T THAT CONSIDERED
FRATERNIZING?
YES, MA'AM.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.824
BUT YOU DID IT ANYWAY.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.626
DID YOU KNOW WHERE
SHE LIVED?

23:13.660 --> 23:14.761
NO.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.896
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

23:16.929 --> 23:18.531
ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.633
SHE TOOK A TRANSPORT
FROM KUWAIT.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.969
DEFINE YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CORPORAL CREWES.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.904
MY RELATIONSHIP?

23:24.937 --> 23:26.906
SHE'S A FELLOW MARINE
AND A FRIEND.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.074
A FRIEND?

23:28.107 --> 23:29.942
SHE HAD TO BE
MORE THAN A FRIEND

23:29.976 --> 23:31.778
FOR YOU TO DISOBEY
A DIRECT ORDER, SERGEANT.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.880
IT'S MASTER SERGEANT,
MA'AM.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.949
SO RANK IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.
I EARNED IT.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.485
SO YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
PRETTY PISSED

23:38.518 --> 23:39.752
WHEN YOU GOT DEMOTED
OVER A WOMAN

23:39.786 --> 23:41.721
THAT WAS FOUR RANKS
BELOW YOU.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.556
JESSICA'S WELFARE
WAS MORE IMPORTANT.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.892
SHE NEEDED MY HELP.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.460
SHE WENT AWOL
AND NEEDED TO REPORT IN.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.928
WELL, IF YOU
WERE GONNA CONVINCE HER,

23:48.961 --> 23:50.730
HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW
WHERE SHE WAS?

23:50.763 --> 23:51.798
SHE TOLD ME.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.867
I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID
THAT YOU COULDN'T REACH HER.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.036
I HAD HER COORDINATES
BEFORE I GOT HERE.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.975
SO YOU TRACKED HER
LIKE PREY...

24:03.009 --> 24:05.512
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO...

24:05.545 --> 24:08.615
BECAUSE SHE WAS RAPED
AND SHE COULD PROVE IT.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.583
SHE WAS ABSENT WITHOUT LEAVE
AND PREGNANT.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.519
SHE NEEDED TO GO BACK
TO CHERRY POINT,

24:12.552 --> 24:15.154
GET SQUARED AWAY,
GET AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.023
TRY GETTING A JOB
WITHOUT ONE.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.858
AND YOU WERE GONNA HELP HER?
I LOOKED OUT FOR HER!

24:18.891 --> 24:21.093
WHETHER SHE LIKED IT
OR NOT.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.700
YOU SEE THAT?

24:29.636 --> 24:31.871
THAT'S ADRENALINE.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.940
YOU ALMOST KILLED A MAN.

24:43.950 --> 24:44.851
THAT BROAD'S GOT PTSD.

24:44.884 --> 24:47.186
I'D KNOW THE GLASSY-EYED
EXPRESSION ANYWHERE.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.055
WHAT IS SHE DOING
CARRYING A GUN?

24:51.290 --> 24:54.594
LOOK...I'M NOT
PRESSING CHARGES, OKAY?

24:54.627 --> 24:55.895
SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.064
I DON'T WANNA GET PRUITT
IN ANY MORE TROUBLE.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.065
YOU THINK I GIVE
A RAT'S ASS

24:59.098 --> 25:00.266
ABOUT YOU FILING
A COMPLAINT?

25:00.299 --> 25:01.834
ISN'T THAT YOUR JOB?

25:01.868 --> 25:03.135
YOU'RE A COMBAT PILOT.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.204
YOU'RE NO VICTIM.
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.006
THE QUESTION
I WANNA KNOW IS

25:07.039 --> 25:09.075
WHY WAS PRUITT
TRYING TO KILL YOU?

25:11.110 --> 25:12.879
IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.080
NOBODY COMES AT SOMEBODY
LIKE THAT

25:14.113 --> 25:15.582
OVER A DISAGREEMENT.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.051
THE JACKHOLE FOUND OUT

25:19.085 --> 25:20.920
THAT I WAS THE ONE
WHO TURNED HIM INTO COMMAND

25:20.953 --> 25:22.589
OVER JESSICA CREWES.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.123
THEY HAD A RELATIONSHIP?

25:24.156 --> 25:26.058
IT WAS MORE LIKE A THING.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.994
PRUITT'S ASSIGNED TO AIRWING
FOR GROUND SUPPORT

25:28.027 --> 25:29.662
SO WE DON'T GET SHOT DOWN
BY RPGs.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.898
OH, SO HE LIVED OUTSIDE THE WIRE
IN THE DESERT.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.332
FOR WEEKS AT A TIME.

25:33.365 --> 25:37.136
BUT THAT'S WHAT BRAWN
IS FOR.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.639
OFF-DUTY...

25:39.672 --> 25:42.074
HE WAS ALL OVER HER.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.844
DID YOU KNOW JESSIE CREWES
REPORTED BEING RAPED?

25:46.045 --> 25:48.114
NO.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.650
BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.251
WHY IS THAT?

25:52.284 --> 25:55.321
SHE HAD A REPUTATION.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.923
A LOT OF WOMEN
IN THE CORPS DO.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.958
WELL, THEY'RE EITHER
BITCHES OR SLUTS.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.192
WHICH ONE WAS JESSIE?
NEITHER.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.929
BUT TO SURVIVE,
SHE HAD TO BE TOUGH.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.330
SHE HAD TO BE BETTER.
SAYS WHO?

26:04.363 --> 26:07.133
THOSE ARE THE RULES
WHEN YOU'RE FIRST.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.769
LOOK, THESE WOMEN
ARE THE FIRST IN COMBAT.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.638
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE,
BUT THEY ARE.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.973
HOW CAN A MAN TRUST YOU
TO WATCH HIS BACK

26:14.006 --> 26:16.709
UNTIL YOU PROVE
THAT YOU CAN?

26:18.177 --> 26:20.780
IT'S NOT FAIR.
IT'S JUST TRUE.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.015
NOW, JESS,
SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.150
SHE WANTED IT EASY.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.652
SO YOU HAD TO TEACH HER
A LESSON,

26:25.685 --> 26:27.019
TOUGHEN HER UP
BY RAPING HER.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.154
NO. I TOLD HER
NOT TO ASK FOR FAVORS.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.623
SOME GUYS WOULD TAKE IT WRONG
AND GIVE HER TROUBLE.

26:30.657 --> 26:31.924
AH, BLAME THE VICTIM.
THAT'S WHAT RAPISTS DO.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.794
LOOK, I DID NOT RAPE
CORPORAL CREWES.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.863
I DID NOT HAVE SEX
WITH HER EITHER--IT'S FORBIDDEN.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.198
WELL, WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOU ONLY
OBEY ORDERS THAT YOU WANT TO.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.067
BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY THERE
TO STOP YOU.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.334
THERE'S NOBODY THERE
TO TELL YOU NO.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.370
DID SHE SAY THAT? HUH?

26:44.403 --> 26:46.372
DID SHE SAY
THAT I RAPED HER?

26:46.405 --> 26:48.775
SHE WAS TOO AFRAID.
YOU MADE SURE OF THAT.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.010
SHE WAS HARASSED
WHEN YOU GOT DEMOTED.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.780
NOW, WHAT WOULD
YOUR LITTLE BUDDIES HAVE DONE

26:53.813 --> 26:55.982
IF SHE NAMED YOU
OUTRIGHT?

26:56.015 --> 26:57.950
I'M THINKING
THAT EVEN YOUR FELLOW MARINES

26:57.984 --> 27:01.287
WOULDN'T HAVE GONE
THIS FAR.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.122
THIS WAS SOMETHING
THAT YOU HAD TO TAKE CARE OF

27:03.155 --> 27:04.991
ALL BY YOURSELF.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.959
AND THAT IS WHY
YOU STALKED HER...

27:06.993 --> 27:09.195
YOU STABBED HER...

27:09.228 --> 27:12.832
AND YOU STUFFED HER
INTO THE TRUNK OF HER OWN CAR.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.035
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE...

27:17.837 --> 27:20.840
YOU SHOULD HAVE PULLED THAT
TRIGGER WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.943
AND IF I WAS LIKE YOU...

27:23.976 --> 27:25.745
I WOULD HAVE.

27:26.946 --> 27:27.914
GUY'S A SOCIOPATH.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.949
HE DIDN'T EVEN BLINK
AT THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.951
HE'S SCRAPED BODY PARTS
OFF THE DESERT FLOOR.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.320
YOU EXPECT HIM TO FALL APART
OVER A BODY IN A TRUNK?

27:34.353 --> 27:36.455
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ADMIT
THAT FOUR TOURS IN IRAQ

27:36.488 --> 27:38.157
HAS TURNED HIM
INTO A COLD-BLOODED KILLER?

27:38.190 --> 27:39.826
OBVIOUSLY IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I THINK,

27:39.859 --> 27:41.160
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO HOLD HIM.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.295
WHAT ABOUT THE ATTACK
ON GARY ROSTEN?

27:43.329 --> 27:45.031
THE LIEUTENANT DECLINED
TO PRESS CHARGES.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.398
I THINK HE WANTS PRUITT
BACK AT HIS POST.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.300
SO THEY'RE TAKING RECRUITS
WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS NOW.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.369
WHAT'S ONE MORE
MURDERING BASTARD WITH A GUN?

27:50.402 --> 27:52.304
(Munch)
FORENSICS CAME BACK
ON PRUITT'S KA-BAR.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.140
DIDN'T FIND ANY BLOOD
MATCHING JESSIE CREWES.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.808
SO? MAYBE HE CLEANED IT.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.777
WELL, THEY DID SAY
THE BLADE IS CONSISTENT

27:57.810 --> 27:58.911
WITH HER WOUND TRACT.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.412
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH

28:00.446 --> 28:02.381
SINCE EVERYONE
IS ISSUED ONE AT INDUCTION.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.850
LOOK, THE EVIDENCE
IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL,

28:03.883 --> 28:04.851
BUT IT'S STRONG.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.318
NOT AGAINST
HIS MILITARY RECORD.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.987
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.188
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
LINKING PRUITT

28:09.221 --> 28:11.023
TO JESSIE'S CAR
OR APARTMENT.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.959
HOW 'BOUT A WITNESS?

28:12.992 --> 28:14.894
THE VICTIM'S LANDLORD?

28:14.927 --> 28:17.930
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHECK
WITH HIM BEFORE NOW?

28:17.964 --> 28:19.465
BECAUSE I SCREWED UP,

28:19.498 --> 28:21.768
AND IT WILL NOT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.206
(Benson)
ARE YOU SURE?

28:27.239 --> 28:29.508
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
THAT'S HIM.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.477
THAT'S THE GUY
I SAW ARGUING WITH JESSIE.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.979
OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR SIGNATURE

28:33.012 --> 28:34.781
RIGHT NEXT TO THAT PHOTO.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.787
GREAT. THANK YOU.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.521
NOT YOUR LUCKY DAY,
SERGEANT.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.390
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.
YOU LIED TO ME.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.092
YOU WERE SEEN
AT JESSIE'S APARTMENT.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.293
YOU WERE HEARD
ARGUING WITH HER.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.929
SHE HAD TO GO
BACK TO BASE.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.964
IT WAS HER ONLY WAY OUT
AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.934
YOU LIED TO ME THEN,
AND YOU'RE LYING TO ME NOW.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.235
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.037
I SAID OPEN YOUR MOUTH,

28:58.070 --> 29:01.307
OR I'M GONNA HAVE YOU RESTRAINED
AND HAVE YOUR BLOOD DRAWN.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.508
YOU DECIDE.

29:17.556 --> 29:18.991
THANKS FOR THE CALL.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.292
ONLY BECAUSE
I HAD TO, COMMANDER.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.393
IT'S THE LAW.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.097
(Benson)
OH, NO, HOLD IT.

29:25.131 --> 29:28.100
YOU DON'T GET HIM
TILL YOU SIGN FOR IT.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.408
THANKS
FOR YOUR HARD WORK.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.210
ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.812
YOU WON'T HAVE CUSTODY
FOR LONG.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.413
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.416
MILITARY JUSTICE
IS SWIFT AND SURE.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.253
AS A PROSECUTOR,
YOU SHOULD APPRECIATE THAT.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.988
I HAVE A MORAL OBJECTION
TO MURDER.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.992
I HAVEN'T DECIDED TO SEEK
THE DEATH PENALTY.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.060
OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.261
THE HEINOUS NATURE
OF THIS CRIME

29:55.294 --> 29:57.964
AND THE PRESS EXPOSURE ALONE
GUARANTEE YOU WANNA KILL HIM.

29:57.997 --> 30:01.467
EXECUTION ISN'T MURDER
WHEN IT'S SANCTIONED BY LAW.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.102
NOT IN NEW YORK.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.104
THERE'S A COURT-ORDERED
MORATORIUM ON THE DEATH PENALTY,

30:05.137 --> 30:07.339
AND I INTEND TO STOP YOU.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.419
LAST TIME I CHECKED,

30:20.452 --> 30:23.322
THE JUDGE ADVOCATE HAD
JURISDICTION OVER ITS MEMBERS.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.324
NOT WHILE HINDERING OUR ABILITY
TO EXERCISE LAW AND ORDER.

30:25.357 --> 30:28.527
POSSE COMITATUS,
MS. GRAYLEK?

30:28.560 --> 30:30.296
A WOMAN IS DEAD,
MURDERED IN THE CITY,

30:30.329 --> 30:33.465
HER UNBORN CHILD
FORCIBLY REMOVED FROM HER BODY.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.567
AND WHAT JUSTICE
CAN YOU OFFER THE BABY?

30:35.601 --> 30:38.637
YOU HAVE NO RECOURSE
OVER VICTIMS KILLED IN UTERO.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.906
WE DO.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.240
HAVE WE LOCATED
THE INFANT'S BODY?

30:41.273 --> 30:42.041
(Graylek)
NO, YOUR HONOR.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.243
AND I DON'T NEED IT
TO PROVE DEATH.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.578
THE UNIFORM CODE ALLOWS
FOR JOINT JURISDICTION.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.580
THE MILITARY HAS GIVEN US
NO RELIEF IN THIS CASE.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.917
TELL YOU WHAT--YOU CAN HAVE
PRUITT WHEN WE'RE DONE.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.919
DOUBLE JEOPARDY
DOESN'T APPLY.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.620
BUT I DOUBT
THAT WE'D WASTE TIME AND MONEY

30:54.653 --> 30:55.421
TRYING HIM AGAIN.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.289
THEY WON'T COURT-MARTIAL
A SUSPECT

30:57.323 --> 30:59.291
IF HE'S ALREADY BEEN PROSECUTED
BY THE STATE.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.660
THEY NEED EVERY PENNY
FOR GUNS AND AMMO.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.995
PRUITT
IS A UNITED STATES MARINE

31:03.029 --> 31:04.296
BOUND BY MILITARY CODE,

31:04.330 --> 31:06.432
IN OR OUT OF UNIFORM,
WHEREVER HE MAY BE.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.634
SOVEREIGNTY IS ABSOLUTE,
YOUR HONOR.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.302
[sighs]

31:10.336 --> 31:12.538
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH THE COMMANDER.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.473
I'LL NEED BENSON
TO GIVE EVIDENCE

31:14.506 --> 31:16.943
AT PRUITT'S ARTICLE 32
HEARING.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.611
OH, AND, UH,

31:19.645 --> 31:21.447
SHE'LL BE SURROUNDED
BY UNIFORMS.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.649
TELL HER TO TAKE A PILL.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.387
(Benson)
LIKE A LOT OF VICTIMS,

31:28.420 --> 31:31.223
CORPORAL CREWES DIDN'T
IMMEDIATELY REPORT HER RAPE.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.926
WHY DON'T VICTIMS
REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT?

31:33.960 --> 31:36.628
BECAUSE THEY OFTEN BLAME
THEMSELVES.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.597
SHAME, FEAR.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.600
MANY TIMES THEY
FEEL VIOLATED AGAIN

31:41.633 --> 31:43.702
BY THE MEDICAL EXAM,
BY HAVING TO TELL THEIR STORY

31:43.735 --> 31:45.704
OVER AND OVER
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.274
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE
THE VICTIM TO FILE A COMPLAINT?

31:48.307 --> 31:49.942
30 DAYS.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.677
AFTER SUCH
A PROLONGED PERIOD,

31:51.710 --> 31:54.546
WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE
LEFT?

31:54.580 --> 31:56.582
THE VICTIM'S PREGNANCY.

31:56.615 --> 32:00.186
SHE DECIDED TO HAVE
HER RAPIST'S BABY.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.554
NOTHING FURTHER.

32:06.658 --> 32:10.329
DETECTIVE BENSON,
DO YOU LIKE THE MILITARY?

32:10.362 --> 32:12.231
NO.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.734
IS IT THE UNIFORMS,
THE WAR?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.736
OR IS IT THE MEN AND WOMEN
WHO BLEED FOR THIS COUNTRY

32:17.769 --> 32:18.770
WHO OFFEND YOU?

32:18.804 --> 32:21.307
I SUPPORT THE TROOPS
THAT FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.475
ARE YOU AWARE, DETECTIVE--
BUT MY PROBLEM...

32:23.509 --> 32:25.411
IS WITH ANY INSTITUTION

32:25.444 --> 32:28.981
THAT REFUSES TO ADDRESS
RAMPANT SEXUAL TRAUMA.

32:30.116 --> 32:31.383
THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.552
ARE YOU AWARE
THE U. S. CONVICTION RATE

32:33.585 --> 32:35.087
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT
IS 13%?

32:35.121 --> 32:37.389
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THIS.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.658
WHILE THE MILITARY'S
CONVICTION RATE STANDS AT 10.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.394
ISN'T IT TRUE YOU WENT AFTER
A DECORATED MARINE

32:42.428 --> 32:44.130
TO GET PRESS
FOR YOUR CRUSADE?

32:44.163 --> 32:45.397
NO.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.233
A CRUSADE, I MIGHT ADD,
THAT HAS NO FOUNDATION.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.135
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.602
MOVE ON,
LIEUTENANT REED.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.404
DID YOU KNOW
THAT CORPORAL CREWES

32:52.438 --> 32:54.673
WAS CITED FOR HAVING SEX
WITH A FELLOW MARINE?

32:54.706 --> 32:57.209
YES. 30 DAYS PRIOR
TO HER RAPE.

32:57.243 --> 32:58.410
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE

32:58.444 --> 33:00.146
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD
CONSENSUAL SEX AGAIN?

33:00.179 --> 33:02.414
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE,

33:02.448 --> 33:05.384
OR YOU DIDN'T ASK IF SHE WAS
STILL SCREWING AGAINST CODE?

33:05.417 --> 33:07.253
LIEUTENANT,

33:07.286 --> 33:09.221
I'LL GIVE YOU EVERY LATITUDE,
BUT WATCH IT.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.789
YES, SIR.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.691
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
SHE CRIED RAPE

33:12.724 --> 33:15.227
TO COVER UP A SUDDEN PREGNANCY
IN A COMBAT ZONE

33:15.261 --> 33:18.397
AS A RESULT OF AN ILLICIT
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP?

33:18.430 --> 33:23.702
NO. NOT WHEN THE CONSEQUENCES
OF REPORTING A RAPE ARE SO HIGH.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.637
ESPECIALLY IN THE MILITARY.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.476
HOW'D IT GO?

33:30.509 --> 33:31.443
BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.479
PRUITT'S ATTORNEY
DIDN'T MENTION THE FACT

33:33.512 --> 33:34.780
THAT I HELD A GUN
TO HIS CLIENT'S HEAD.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.716
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH JESSIE'S MURDER.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.585
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS
FIND EVERY WEAKNESS.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.487
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.655
I GET YOU
NOT WANTING PEOPLE TO KNOW

33:43.689 --> 33:45.591
THAT YOU'RE IN THERAPY.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.626
AH, WELL, I MAY NOT
HAVE A CHOICE.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.829
AS LONG AS YOU WORK AT IT,
THE FLASHBACKS WILL GO AWAY.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.531
DID FOR ME.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.832
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.468
FORENSICS CAME BACK
ON THE CORD BLOOD.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.304
PRUITT'S DNA DIDN'T MATCH.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.538
TEST IT AGAIN.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.141
THEY ALREADY DID--TWICE.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.611
I WAS WRONG.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.713
IF PRUITT'S NOT OUR GUY...

34:07.746 --> 34:10.482
WHO IS?

34:10.516 --> 34:12.118
STILL HAVE FOUR SUSPECTS

34:12.151 --> 34:14.453
WHO ALL WORKED IN CLOSE QUARTERS
WITH THE VICTIM.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.488
IT HAD TO BE SOMEBODY
THAT SHE WORKED WITH EVERY DAY

34:16.522 --> 34:18.357
WHO WATCHED HER,
WHO THOUGHT ABOUT HER,

34:18.390 --> 34:21.293
WHO ENJOYED
ORDERING HER AROUND...

34:21.327 --> 34:23.095
LIKE A PILOT.

34:23.129 --> 34:26.298
WHO WAS ATTACKED BY
AN ANGRY MARINE WITH A KA-BAR.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.566
YOU CAN'T KEEP ME
HERE.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.135
WE HAVE QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR MOVEMENTS

34:29.168 --> 34:31.570
THE NIGHT JESSICA CREWES
WAS MURDERED.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.105
SO ASK.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.707
I DIDN'T SAY
WE WANTED TO ASK YOU.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.110
YOUR HUSBAND RAPED
AND MURDERED JESSICA CREWES...

34:38.144 --> 34:40.212
AND YOU HELPED HIM.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.613
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.582
YOU LIKE BEING MARRIED
TO A PILOT.

34:43.615 --> 34:45.751
YOU LOVE THE PRESTIGE.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.719
AND YOU
WEREN'T GONNA LET JESSICA

34:47.753 --> 34:49.255
RUIN EVERYTHING
THAT YOU BUILT.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.123
YOU'RE CRAZY.

34:51.157 --> 34:54.693
I-I'M NOT LISTENING TO THIS,
AND YOU CAN'T KEEP ME HERE.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.596
YOUR HUSBAND'S DNA
MATCHES THE BABY'S BLOOD.

34:57.629 --> 35:00.632
THAT'S A LIE.
THERE IS NO BABY.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.469
THEN HOW COME I HAVE A PIECE
OF THE UMBILICAL CORD

35:03.502 --> 35:06.572
THAT THE BASTARD
LEFT BEHIND?

35:06.605 --> 35:09.808
YOU COULD BE CHARGED
WITH AIDING AND ABETTING.

35:10.909 --> 35:12.611
AND TRUST ME...

35:12.644 --> 35:14.780
NO JUDGE
IS GONNA BE LENIENT.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.651
YOU CAN'T TALK TO MY WIFE
WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY PRESENT.

35:19.685 --> 35:20.586
WE HAVE RIGHTS.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.689
YOU BELONG TO UNCLE SAM.
YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.658
SHE CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING
THAT YOU CAN USE, OKAY?

35:26.692 --> 35:28.627
IT'S BETWEEN A HUSBAND AND WIFE.
IT'S PRIVILEGED.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.662
THERE'S NOTHING PRIVILEGED
ABOUT HER ACTIONS.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.231
IF SHE'S GUILTY,

35:32.264 --> 35:34.600
SHE'LL FLIP FOR A DEAL.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.169
(Benson)
WELL, I COULD ASK THE D.A.
FOR LENIENCY,

35:37.203 --> 35:38.470
BUT I'M TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW,

35:38.504 --> 35:39.371
IF I WALK OUT THAT DOOR,

35:39.405 --> 35:41.540
I PROMISE YOU
I WILL NEVER COME BACK.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.913
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS GONNA KILL HER.

35:49.881 --> 35:52.351
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED,
MARLENE.

35:55.454 --> 35:58.824
GARY SAID JESSIE
WAS THE CAMP SLUT...

35:58.857 --> 36:01.660
AND IN A MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS,

36:01.693 --> 36:03.795
HE MADE A MISTAKE.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.598
A RAPE ACCUSATION
WOULD HAVE RUINED MY FAMILY.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.667
I WANTED TO CONFRONT HER.

36:08.700 --> 36:09.701
BUT SHE'D
ALREADY GONE AWOL,

36:09.735 --> 36:12.571
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE CHANCE.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.707
HOW DID YOU GET
JESSIE'S CELL PHONE NUMBER?

36:15.741 --> 36:19.678
I HAD A FRIEND WHO WORKED
IN BASE PERSONNEL.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.780
AND YOU USED
A DISPOSABLE PHONE.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.816
GARY GAVE IT TO ME.

36:26.352 --> 36:29.888
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO JESSIE
TO MAKE HER TRUST YOU?

36:31.790 --> 36:33.792
IF MY HUSBAND WAS A RAPIST,

36:33.825 --> 36:36.962
I HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW...

36:36.995 --> 36:39.798
THAT I NEEDED
TO SHIELD MY KIDS.

36:41.767 --> 36:44.536
I SAID I HAD TO HEAR
THE DETAILS FACE-TO-FACE.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.672
AND SHE TOLD YOU
WHERE SHE WAS.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.876
SHE FELT SORRY FOR ME.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.745
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

36:56.782 --> 36:59.785
WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND DO
WITH THE BABY?

37:04.356 --> 37:07.626
HE SAID HE THREW THE BODY
IN THE...HUDSON.

37:12.531 --> 37:14.733
[sobbing]

37:23.609 --> 37:25.344
(Benson)
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

37:28.380 --> 37:30.782
THE HUDSON CURRENTS
RUN TOWARD NEW JERSEY,

37:30.816 --> 37:33.785
BUT WE DRAGGED THE RIVER
ON BOTH SIDES TO BE SURE.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.854
YOU FOUND THE BABY.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.791
HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE,
DID HE?

37:39.825 --> 37:43.362
WARNER SAID HE WAS PROBABLY
DEAD BEFORE HE HIT THE WATER.

37:43.395 --> 37:46.332
SHE DIDN'T FIND
ANY FLUID IN HIS LUNGS.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.066
WELL, THAT'S COMFORTING.
I'LL LET THE GRANDMOTHER KNOW.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.369
MAYBE SHE CAN STITCH IT
ON A PILLOW.
OLIVIA.

37:57.776 --> 38:01.313
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
SOME PERSONAL TIME OFF.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.514
WHY?

38:02.548 --> 38:03.482
YOU KNOW WHY.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.751
JUST DO IT.

38:07.453 --> 38:08.654
IS THAT AN ORDER,
CAPTAIN?

38:08.687 --> 38:10.356
NO.

38:10.389 --> 38:13.959
IF IT WAS, I'D HAVE TO MAKE
A NOTATION IN YOUR JACKET.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.465
HOW MUCH TIME
SHOULD I TAKE OFF?

38:19.498 --> 38:21.833
AS MUCH AS YOU NEED.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.710
COMMANDER MARCUS SAID
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, MA'AM.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.679
IT'S OLIVIA, AND...

38:33.712 --> 38:36.382
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.683
FOR WHAT?

38:37.716 --> 38:41.587
YOU DID YOUR JOB
AND GOT JUSTICE FOR JESSIE.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.622
I DON'T GET YOU
AT ALL.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.858
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.661
I KNEW MY DNA
WOULDN'T MATCH.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.730
I TOLD YOU,
I DIDN'T HAVE SEX WITH HER.

38:53.699 --> 38:56.968
YOU JUST LOOKED OUT
FOR HER.

38:57.002 --> 38:57.769
A MARINE IN MY UNIT

38:57.803 --> 39:00.506
GOT ATTACKED
BY HER SUPERIOR OFFICER.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.508
SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
AND NEEDED HELP.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.942
THAT'S MY JOB.

39:05.611 --> 39:06.812
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO
TO YOUR C.O.?

39:06.845 --> 39:08.580
ACCUSING AN OFFICER
WITHOUT PROOF

39:08.614 --> 39:10.416
WILL LAND YOU
IN THE BRIG.

39:10.449 --> 39:13.385
AND ROSTEN HAD ALREADY
TURNED YOU IN FOR FRATERNIZING.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.687
THAT'S WHY I
WENT AFTER HIM.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.088
EITHER HE CONFESSED...

39:17.122 --> 39:20.626
OR HE WOULDN'T BE COMING BACK
FROM HIS NEXT DEPLOYMENT.

39:22.494 --> 39:23.895
WOULD YOU
HAVE KILLED HIM?

39:26.698 --> 39:29.034
WOULD YOU HAVE SHOT ME?

39:30.702 --> 39:32.538
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

39:34.072 --> 39:36.675
AND YOU DESERVE
TO KNOW WHY.

39:39.110 --> 39:43.449
I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
SIX MONTHS AGO.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.859
QUIT KICKING YOURSELF.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.461
WELL...

39:55.494 --> 39:57.929
THAT'S EASY TO SAY
AND HARD TO DO.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.433
TAKES PRACTICE.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.736
YOU'LL GET THERE.

40:12.844 --> 40:13.979
[elevator bell dings]

40:14.012 --> 40:15.046
I GOTTA CATCH MY TRAIN.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.482
YEAH.

40:18.950 --> 40:19.985
MASTER SERGEANT.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.887
DOMINIC.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.623
BE CAREFUL.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.625
I'M A MARINE.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.594
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

40:28.627 --> 40:31.630
