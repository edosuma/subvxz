WEBVTT

00:07.560 --> 00:10.199
You go all over town...

00:10.457 --> 00:12.732
There ought to be a law.

00:13.561 --> 00:15.233
- Bunch of meatheads.
- So it's true.

00:15.465 --> 00:18.775
He keeps on talking
even when people aren't there.

00:19.066 --> 00:23.378
Yes, but if no one's there to hear it,
does he really make a sound?

00:24.488 --> 00:26.638
Cliffie, is it worth my asking
what the problem is?

00:26.888 --> 00:28.765
Yeah, Norm, it's my transmission.

00:28.999 --> 00:31.274
Spend day after day taking it
to garages all over town,

00:31.524 --> 00:34.277
- nobody can fix it.
- Here we go, Cliffie.

00:34.545 --> 00:37.423
Pierson's Garage, Braintree.

00:37.690 --> 00:39.009
They can fix anything. All right?

00:39.222 --> 00:42.020
Yeah, well, yeah.
Thank you very much, Normie.

00:42.284 --> 00:45.401
You know, my toaster's on the blink.
You think they could fix it?

00:47.251 --> 00:50.561
Well, only if you got one in your car.

00:50.852 --> 00:52.922
See, they're
auto mechanics, Woody.

00:53.169 --> 00:56.161
Oh, great, it's in
the back seat right now.

00:57.805 --> 00:59.397
All right, all right. Take it easy, Norm.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.105
The kid's good, but you can take him.

01:01.323 --> 01:04.281
All right, I have to select my
words rather carefully here.

01:04.551 --> 01:11.070
Woody, they can fix only those things
that originally came with the car

01:11.463 --> 01:12.452
when you bought it.

01:12.663 --> 01:14.972
As far as I know, cars don't come
with toasters.

01:15.229 --> 01:17.220
Well, mine did.

01:17.919 --> 01:19.671
It was part of a
promotional campaign.

01:19.947 --> 01:23.337
You know, if I'd bought a convertible,
I'd have got a food processor.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.695
Ask for Luis.
He doesn't speak English.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.800 --> 02:44.791
Woody, whisky neat.

02:46.138 --> 02:49.255
Frasier, what are you doing here?
I thought you had a date tonight.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.552
I did, but when I showed up,
she was in the middle of a shower.

02:53.734 --> 02:55.133
Well, couldn't you wait?

02:55.361 --> 02:57.795
It was her bridal shower.

02:59.367 --> 03:03.565
Next time I make a date two months
in advance, I'll call to confirm.

03:04.917 --> 03:05.986
Afternoon, everybody.

03:06.211 --> 03:09.089
- Hey, Sam, how were the mountains?
- It rained all weekend.

03:09.383 --> 03:10.372
Sam, you forgot this.

03:10.635 --> 03:12.512
Yeah, thank you.

03:15.350 --> 03:17.306
In other words, it was great.

03:19.982 --> 03:22.337
Hey, Diane, how you doing there?

03:22.820 --> 03:24.492
How am I doing?

03:25.074 --> 03:26.985
Did you ask me how I'm doing?

03:27.285 --> 03:29.958
No, not me. That was Woody.
He's a ventriloquist.

03:32.585 --> 03:33.700
Why? What's the matter?

03:37.092 --> 03:39.003
- Last week...
- Yeah?

03:39.262 --> 03:42.174
...we were at passion's portal...

03:43.727 --> 03:49.404
...standing on the threshold of a new
and excitingly textured relationship.

03:49.820 --> 03:53.210
We were about to open the door
on a brand-new beginning for us.

03:54.118 --> 03:58.316
Well, I knocked at the door,
but nobody was home,

03:58.667 --> 04:01.545
so I went to the mountains
with the girl next door.

04:03.174 --> 04:04.732
I see.

04:04.968 --> 04:07.641
Apparently last week meant
more to me than it did to you.

04:08.307 --> 04:10.616
Come on, what are you doing here?

04:10.894 --> 04:13.408
Are you saying that even though
we're not really going together,

04:13.690 --> 04:15.487
you want me not to date
anybody else?

04:16.904 --> 04:19.702
It's not what I want, Sam.
It's what you want that's important.

04:20.033 --> 04:21.785
Well, good. Because what l
wanted to do

04:22.036 --> 04:24.072
was go to the mountains
with Andrea.

04:24.624 --> 04:26.580
Very well. Let's just forget
the whole thing.

04:26.877 --> 04:30.347
Oh, come on, Diane.
It was just physical.

04:30.675 --> 04:33.712
I mean, that stuff doesn't
mean anything to me.

04:34.347 --> 04:37.066
Come on, don't you see what I'm
doing here? I'm just honing my skills

04:37.352 --> 04:40.230
for that magical night that you
and I hit the sheets running.

04:40.523 --> 04:47.395
Sam, you and I will couple when 1,000
ice ages have come and gone.

04:48.244 --> 04:51.634
All right. How soon do we
get to play touchy-feely?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.114
Lighten up, will you?

04:54.128 --> 04:57.006
- Good evening, citizens.
- Looking a little beat, buddy.

04:57.299 --> 05:00.575
Been staying up late watching
those adult movies on cable again?

05:00.888 --> 05:03.800
Ma put a lock on that channel.

05:07.607 --> 05:08.926
It's my paperboy, Normie.

05:09.151 --> 05:11.142
He's hitting every place
but the front porch.

05:11.404 --> 05:12.883
So I got a little plan worked out now.

05:13.533 --> 05:15.808
All right, get this, 4::30
tomorrow morning in the a.m.,

05:16.370 --> 05:18.281
I'm gonna put on the old
camouflage jacket,

05:18.540 --> 05:20.132
stick a couple of branches
behind my ears,

05:20.376 --> 05:22.048
and duck in the rhododendron bush.

05:22.296 --> 05:24.048
He's smart, but I'm
a little bit smarter.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.151
You talking about the kid
or the rhododendron bush?

05:29.975 --> 05:33.763
I wanna see all my employees
in my office, immediately.

05:36.067 --> 05:39.742
Cheers staff, this means you.
In the office, on the double.

05:42.744 --> 05:44.302
Hey, come on, you heard me.

05:44.914 --> 05:46.711
We didn't hear the magic word.

05:48.211 --> 05:50.167
- Please.
- That's not it.

05:51.299 --> 05:53.415
Come on, Carla,
what's the magic word?

05:53.845 --> 05:56.040
Money. We all want a dollar.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.994
Okay, okay, all right.

06:01.315 --> 06:03.749
Come on, come on, here you go.
Here's one for you. Here you go.

06:04.027 --> 06:05.255
One for you.

06:05.488 --> 06:06.807
One for you.

06:07.032 --> 06:08.385
Whoa, wait, whoa.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.607
What are you trying to do?

06:09.828 --> 06:11.466
- Beat me out of a buck here?
- Sammy.

06:11.706 --> 06:14.266
I'm here out of a fierce sense
of loyalty as your accountant, pal.

06:14.543 --> 06:17.580
And the dollar is your little way
of saying thank you.

06:19.342 --> 06:20.536
Well, thank you for coming.

06:21.179 --> 06:23.295
I want you all to take a look at this
in the newspaper.

06:23.557 --> 06:24.910
It really got me going here.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.937
"Grown Man Lives in Refrigerator"?

06:27.230 --> 06:28.583
No.

06:28.857 --> 06:29.892
No, no. Not that part.

06:30.109 --> 06:31.542
Let me see that.

06:31.778 --> 06:35.487
Oh, my God, look at that.
He's got a TV in there.

06:36.828 --> 06:38.978
Sam, what is this about?

06:39.999 --> 06:41.990
Oh, yeah, all right.

06:42.253 --> 06:44.892
Yeah, column three,
down at the bottom.

06:45.383 --> 06:48.455
"Don Talbot's Locker Room,
Grand Opening."

06:48.763 --> 06:52.438
Yeah, not only that, Don has got two
other pubs opening the same time.

06:52.811 --> 06:54.642
I mean, he's doing
fantastic business here.

06:54.939 --> 06:57.931
What's this got to do
with the guy in the refrigerator?

06:59.988 --> 07:02.297
Nothing, Woody, nothing.
This has to do with me.

07:02.576 --> 07:03.850
This has to do with my life.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.951
I mean, Don was up
with the Red Sox for what,

07:06.206 --> 07:07.605
a cup of coffee, for goodness sake.

07:07.834 --> 07:10.268
I was there five years,
and now this clown is a celebrity,

07:10.546 --> 07:12.901
and I'm paying my employees
to come talk to me.

07:16.097 --> 07:17.689
You're gonna be paying us a lot more

07:17.933 --> 07:21.005
unless this conversation
starts getting exciting.

07:21.730 --> 07:22.719
Okay, fair enough.

07:22.941 --> 07:25.330
I brought you in here because
I wanna ask you a question:

07:25.611 --> 07:27.567
What is Cheers missing?

07:27.823 --> 07:29.814
A mechanical bull.

07:31.788 --> 07:33.904
No, Woody, that was one of those
questions you ask

07:34.166 --> 07:35.963
when you don't
really want an answer.

07:36.336 --> 07:37.689
You mean, rhetorical.

07:40.718 --> 07:41.992
Yeah, rhetorical, right.

07:42.220 --> 07:45.212
Anyway, what I'm gonna do here,

07:45.517 --> 07:48.031
is I am gonna come out
from behind the bar,

07:48.313 --> 07:53.433
and I'm gonna become a full-time
manager/host.

07:53.863 --> 07:54.932
A what?

07:55.199 --> 07:57.554
Manager/host.

07:58.287 --> 07:59.356
Yeah, I greet people.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.652
No, it's perfect. I mean, let's face it.
I'm recognized on the street.

08:03.378 --> 08:05.130
So is a fire hydrant.

08:06.424 --> 08:09.894
You see, at the same time, I'll be able
to hustle up some more business,

08:10.222 --> 08:14.818
I'll be able to handle the publicity,
the quality control, handling bookings.

08:15.188 --> 08:16.337
I mean, it's great.

08:16.565 --> 08:17.918
What do you think?

08:18.192 --> 08:20.865
Is that another rhetorical question?

08:21.656 --> 08:24.773
Well, yeah, it is, Woody, actually,
because we're gonna do it.

08:25.078 --> 08:26.511
We're gonna start immediately.

08:26.747 --> 08:28.942
Does that mean you
won't be bartending anymore?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.244
I'm glad you asked that.

08:30.461 --> 08:32.417
Now that I've
moved up to management,

08:32.673 --> 08:35.745
we're gonna have an opening behind
the bar, and we're gonna need to fill it.

08:36.053 --> 08:38.486
Wait a minute. You know, there was
a guy in here the other day,

08:38.765 --> 08:42.395
- had an application. He was fantastic--
- Hey, now wait. Time out, Sammy.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.364
Does this mean that you're
gonna be hiring

08:44.608 --> 08:46.041
- another full-time bartender?
- Yeah.

08:46.277 --> 08:48.313
I have to advise you,
I think that's unwise.

08:49.491 --> 08:51.527
- You sure?
- I'd stake my career on it.

08:51.786 --> 08:53.583
You're unemployed.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.847
All right, I'll stake your career on it.

08:58.129 --> 09:01.246
You really-- You can't afford yourself
as a full-time host/manager.

09:01.551 --> 09:02.825
No, see, that's the beauty of it.

09:03.053 --> 09:06.170
As manager, I'll be thinking up new
schemes to bring in more business,

09:06.475 --> 09:08.352
but I'll be so darned charming
as the host,

09:08.604 --> 09:10.993
that people will start bringing in
more friends. It's perfect.

09:11.274 --> 09:13.868
I'll be thinking and charming
all at the same time.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.224
Add chewing gum,
and we can sell tickets.

09:18.369 --> 09:23.523
Sammy, I'm sceptical,
but more importantly, I'm thirsty, so...

09:23.919 --> 09:26.752
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks for coming in.

09:31.764 --> 09:34.562
Ken, don't forget to run a
handkerchief over those shoes.

09:34.894 --> 09:36.168
Mr Malone, they're tennis shoes.

09:36.438 --> 09:38.633
Well, don't spend
too long on them then.

09:40.695 --> 09:42.128
Hey, what's with the spread, Sam?

09:42.406 --> 09:44.158
Well, I really topped myself tonight.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.922
I booked a party in here.

09:46.162 --> 09:50.599
The-- Let's see. The Fraternal Order
of the Caribou's sending a group over.

09:51.002 --> 09:52.993
Great.

09:53.256 --> 09:58.376
A group of loudmouthed, rowdy
conventioneers, drinking like fish,

09:58.764 --> 10:01.278
swearing like sailors,
and putting their paws all over us.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.836
Yeah, happy birthday to me.

10:06.860 --> 10:07.895
How many are coming?

10:08.112 --> 10:10.580
Well, I don't know. They said they're
sending over a whole herd,

10:10.866 --> 10:12.618
so I guess we're
gonna be swamped here.

10:13.287 --> 10:16.085
I just hope we have enough food.
What do you think?

10:18.587 --> 10:22.102
Welcome. I'm Sam Malone,
your host and owner of Cheers.

10:22.426 --> 10:24.303
You may remember me
as Mayday Malone,

10:24.554 --> 10:26.112
the relief pitcher for the Red Sox?

10:26.390 --> 10:28.904
Anyway, I just want you to know
the autographs are free,

10:29.186 --> 10:30.665
but the drinks are gonna cost you.

10:30.939 --> 10:32.497
Make him go away, Neal.

10:35.154 --> 10:37.304
Well, welcome.

10:38.784 --> 10:40.979
Carla, a couple tables over here
you may wanna get to.

10:41.455 --> 10:44.811
Gee, wait on tables. Is that what
a waitress is supposed to do?

10:45.128 --> 10:46.322
Thanks for the tip, Sam.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.423
Diane, we need a mop
over here, please.

10:49.801 --> 10:52.520
I'll buy the bullets
if you'll pull the trigger.

10:53.182 --> 10:56.060
Shooting is too quick.
I want him to suffer.

10:56.353 --> 10:57.752
Why don't you date him again?

11:01.027 --> 11:03.780
Get it in gear, girls.
We got new customers coming in.

11:04.073 --> 11:06.633
Not if you greet them.

11:07.203 --> 11:08.272
What?

11:08.497 --> 11:09.691
Sam,

11:10.166 --> 11:11.997
this isn't working.

11:12.253 --> 11:13.652
We've done this for a week,

11:13.880 --> 11:15.711
and I haven't seen
any more customers

11:15.967 --> 11:17.878
than there were before you
took over as host.

11:18.137 --> 11:19.934
In fact, there are less.

11:20.182 --> 11:23.697
And you haven't come up with
one good idea to increase business.

11:24.063 --> 11:26.782
Tonight's different. I've booked
a whole lodge into this place.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.627
I mean, tonight-- Tonight we're
making Cheers history here.

11:29.905 --> 11:33.500
A little of the old Malone magic
is beginning to spread.

11:34.954 --> 11:36.831
I could use some of that
on my flowers.

11:37.124 --> 11:38.523
Just--

11:42.925 --> 11:44.404
Well, Woody,

11:44.636 --> 11:48.106
Iooks like the new man behind the bar
is working out pretty well, huh?

11:48.434 --> 11:51.551
Yeah, he's doing pretty well
considering the pressure he's under.

11:51.856 --> 11:54.734
I mean, after all, working around
a man of my experience

11:55.027 --> 11:57.018
is probably a little bit intimidating.

12:01.495 --> 12:04.214
Good, he seems to be adjusting.

12:05.961 --> 12:07.519
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sam Malone.

12:07.755 --> 12:10.189
Yeah. Let go of me, you little devil.

12:10.843 --> 12:12.993
Yes, I am. I'm--

12:13.430 --> 12:15.898
- I'm the manager.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

12:16.185 --> 12:17.618
- Well, thank you.
- Fred Anderson.

12:17.854 --> 12:20.209
- Social Director, Caribou Lodge.
- Yeah, right. I got you.

12:20.483 --> 12:22.075
- Well, you ready for us?
- You bet I am.

12:22.319 --> 12:24.116
Great, great.

12:24.865 --> 12:27.584
Come on in, guys. Looks clean.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.394
Gather around, employees, please.

12:29.622 --> 12:31.453
Okay, now, next couple hours
it's gonna be hell.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.540
You're gonna be running
your little tushies off.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.911
But tonight, when you put your
head down on the pillow,

12:36.174 --> 12:38.642
you're gonna know it was worth it,
because tonight is the night

12:38.928 --> 12:40.998
that we put Cheers on the map.
Okay, all right.

12:49.403 --> 12:51.155
You guys are the whole lodge?

12:51.447 --> 12:54.405
Yeah, we just got our charter
last week.

12:55.287 --> 12:56.800
You're right, Sam.

12:57.039 --> 12:58.267
We just got on the map.

12:58.500 --> 13:02.778
Cheers, population: three Caribou,
one jackass.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.355
Aren't people like that sad?

13:12.629 --> 13:14.221
Huddled together,

13:15.175 --> 13:18.804
totally lacking confidence
in their own individuality.

13:19.182 --> 13:21.173
And incapable of an original thought.

13:21.435 --> 13:24.711
You know,
as Dr Bennett Ludlow once said,

13:25.024 --> 13:28.380
"I'll speak no thought but mine own."

13:34.790 --> 13:36.781
All right, I'll admit that things
haven't turned out

13:37.043 --> 13:39.921
exactly the way I planned them,
but it'll be okay.

13:40.215 --> 13:42.934
They'll tell their friends,
and their friends will tell their friends.

13:43.220 --> 13:46.974
Do you have anything else?
I'm allergic to shellfish.

13:47.936 --> 13:49.654
Sammy, I'd face reality if I were you.

13:49.898 --> 13:54.767
You have three guys in bad suits and
enough food to cater the Crusades.

13:55.532 --> 13:58.729
Next to this, Hula Night
was a smashing success.

13:59.037 --> 14:00.709
All right, it's okay.

14:00.956 --> 14:04.187
I know things haven't gone
exactly great up to this point,

14:04.504 --> 14:06.574
but they will, they will.
I'll think of something.

14:07.008 --> 14:09.203
Hey, skimpy outfits
on the waitresses, Sammy.

14:09.470 --> 14:11.506
- That's not bad.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

14:11.766 --> 14:14.758
I don't want people having to look
at something I'm ashamed of.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.815
- You got a lovely body.
- Yeah.

14:17.066 --> 14:18.943
I'm talking about hers.

14:20.113 --> 14:22.991
You see, Sammy,
topless waitresses, scientific fact,

14:23.284 --> 14:27.038
they can deliver drinks faster than
their clothed counterparts.

14:27.416 --> 14:28.690
Just forget it, Clavin.

14:28.918 --> 14:32.354
This is just your slimy way of trying
to cop a look at my tooters.

14:36.973 --> 14:39.612
Well, everything seems to be
running smoothly out here.

14:39.894 --> 14:43.682
Think I'll step in my office
and think up some more ideas here.

14:44.026 --> 14:45.937
I don't wanna be disturbed.

14:46.196 --> 14:48.107
Go away, Diane.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.605
Sam, may I speak to you
for a minute?

14:52.790 --> 14:56.226
This situation isn't working.

14:56.588 --> 14:59.261
Your schemes aren't working,

14:59.592 --> 15:02.265
and you're driving Carla and me crazy,

15:02.556 --> 15:05.912
and if you continue this
entrepreneurial bent of yours,

15:06.228 --> 15:08.184
you're going to bankrupt the bar.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.716
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

15:10.986 --> 15:12.385
Well, I don't know what.

15:12.613 --> 15:14.444
Well, because you don't
have my brain.

15:16.161 --> 15:17.753
Well, whoever has it
should return it.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.739
You need it right now.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.555
Hey, leave me alone, please.

15:24.799 --> 15:25.834
Oh, Sam, I'm sorry.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.689
It's just obvious
what has to happen here.

15:27.929 --> 15:29.248
You have to go back
behind the bar.

15:29.474 --> 15:32.307
I know. I know. I've known it
for a long time.

15:32.645 --> 15:34.283
But why aren't you
doing anything about it?

15:34.523 --> 15:38.436
Well, because doing something
about it means I have to fire Ken.

15:40.533 --> 15:41.966
Right.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.794
And he's such a nice guy too.

15:44.039 --> 15:46.234
Yeah, damn it.

15:46.543 --> 15:48.374
All right, I've put this off
long enough.

15:48.630 --> 15:50.621
Go get Ken.
I'll handle this right now,

15:50.883 --> 15:53.681
and I'll do it quickly,
cleanly and painlessly.

15:53.971 --> 15:56.405
Just like a surgeon. Yeah.
Yeah, just like a surgeon.

15:56.684 --> 15:58.276
Very well.

16:00.941 --> 16:02.533
- He's headed this way.
- All right.

16:02.778 --> 16:06.293
I suggest you start
scrubbing up, Dr Malone.

16:07.368 --> 16:09.006
- Sam, you got a minute?
- Yeah, Ken.

16:09.246 --> 16:11.237
I'd like you to meet my family.

16:16.006 --> 16:19.681
I just want you to know that it was
pretty rough going there for a while,

16:20.013 --> 16:22.891
- for the four of us.
- The five of us.

16:24.604 --> 16:26.276
But thanks to you,
we've turned the corner.

16:26.524 --> 16:28.674
Kids, this is Mr Sam Malone.

16:28.944 --> 16:29.933
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.508
Hi.

16:33.911 --> 16:39.065
Well, this-- This is very nice, Ken,
but I do need to talk to you.

16:40.129 --> 16:43.917
Oh, yeah, well, all right,
there you go.

16:46.597 --> 16:47.632
Yes, Mr Malone?

16:50.271 --> 16:51.750
Ken...

16:53.943 --> 16:55.899
...I'm giving you a raise.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.789
That's terrific. Well, thank you.

17:00.036 --> 17:01.594
Thank you, Mr Malone.

17:01.831 --> 17:04.140
Come on, honey, I want to introduce
you to the others, okay?

17:04.417 --> 17:05.692
Okay. Nice to meet you.

17:05.920 --> 17:06.989
Yeah, you too. You too.

17:07.214 --> 17:10.843
- Come on, children.
- We want to stay with Uncle Sam.

17:11.972 --> 17:14.088
- Is that all right, Sam?
- Sure, sure.

17:17.105 --> 17:20.142
Well, quite an operation, Dr Malone.

17:21.237 --> 17:22.750
What am I gonna do?

17:22.989 --> 17:24.707
I can't fire Woody.

17:25.702 --> 17:30.173
Well, maybe if he knew the
situation, he'd wanna go.

17:30.877 --> 17:34.870
Why don't you just explain it to him,
and let him draw his own conclusion?

17:35.217 --> 17:37.685
Maybe he'll volunteer to leave.

17:37.972 --> 17:40.691
He's such a sweet guy.
I'll bet he will.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.847
Boy, he is a sweet guy.

17:44.107 --> 17:46.143
Of course he will.

17:47.737 --> 17:52.367
Sam, you look quite natural sitting
there with a babe on each knee.

17:53.329 --> 17:56.207
She's seen babes in my lap before.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.655
Yes, but these know
how to tie their own shoes.

18:03.471 --> 18:05.621
Goodbye, you sweet little cherubs.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.721
I don't like her.

18:10.482 --> 18:12.438
Try dating her.

18:14.572 --> 18:16.051
Sam, you wanted to see me?

18:16.283 --> 18:17.955
Yes, I do, Woody.

18:18.370 --> 18:20.964
Say, you know Ken's
two kids here, don't you?

18:21.249 --> 18:22.762
Yeah, I met them before. Hi.

18:23.003 --> 18:24.152
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:24.380 --> 18:25.972
Yeah. Sit down, Woody.

18:26.258 --> 18:29.853
I called you in here
because I got a kind of problem.

18:30.181 --> 18:31.694
I hope I can help you, Sam.

18:31.933 --> 18:34.128
Well, I hope so too, Woody.

18:34.563 --> 18:38.351
You know, that scheme of mine to
come out from behind the bar

18:38.695 --> 18:42.608
and be a host/manager
hasn't turned out too well.

18:42.951 --> 18:45.067
Well, that's putting it mildly.

18:45.330 --> 18:47.446
But if it means I'm gonna get you
back behind the bar,

18:47.709 --> 18:48.858
then I can't say I'm sorry.

18:49.086 --> 18:52.442
Well, it does mean that you're getting
me back behind the bar, Woody,

18:52.759 --> 18:58.675
but the problem is,
I can't afford three bartenders.

19:01.105 --> 19:03.255
You did meet Ken's kids here,
haven't you?

19:03.567 --> 19:05.797
- Yeah, I did. Hi.
- Hi.

19:08.074 --> 19:12.704
So, what it boils down to, Woody, is
I'm gonna have to let somebody go.

19:13.709 --> 19:15.381
Boy, that's tough, Sam.

19:15.962 --> 19:17.190
Yeah.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.414
You kids are getting
awful heavy here.

19:19.676 --> 19:22.270
Why don't you go sit on old
Uncle Woody's lap there, huh?

19:22.556 --> 19:24.114
There you go. There you go.

19:24.351 --> 19:25.625
Hey, there we go.

19:25.853 --> 19:29.448
Okay, now, Woody, try to follow
me closely on this, okay?

19:29.776 --> 19:34.327
Now, see, I can't fire myself because,
well, I own the place.

19:34.701 --> 19:36.453
- Well, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

19:36.704 --> 19:38.376
So that means

19:39.000 --> 19:43.118
either you or Ken,

19:43.549 --> 19:45.221
the father of these two kids.

19:47.472 --> 19:49.224
You get what
I'm saying here, Woody?

19:50.434 --> 19:51.833
- No.
- I do. I do.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.741
No, no, no.

19:54.691 --> 19:58.400
Listen, maybe you kids
ought to go now, huh?

19:58.739 --> 20:02.129
Thank you. Bye-bye,
sweetheart, bye-bye.

20:06.836 --> 20:09.145
You're firing me, Sam.

20:11.969 --> 20:15.644
Woody, l-- Boy, I don't know
what to say here, man.

20:17.979 --> 20:20.174
Leave Cheers.

20:20.816 --> 20:26.129
You know, I always thought this job
was just too good to keep forever.

20:27.578 --> 20:29.011
Well, I understand.

20:29.246 --> 20:31.316
You know, I'm young and unattached,

20:31.584 --> 20:34.621
and I can afford to be
out of work more than Ken.

20:36.341 --> 20:40.300
- You are the sweetest guy I know.
- You are too, Sam.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.039
Whoa, what are we doing here?

20:42.267 --> 20:43.700
This doesn't have to be
a big goodbye.

20:43.937 --> 20:48.215
I'll help you find another job, and if
Ken ever leaves, you'll be first in line.

20:48.569 --> 20:49.718
I appreciate that.

20:51.324 --> 20:52.313
Woody--

20:52.534 --> 20:54.013
No, I know what
you're gonna say, Sam.

20:54.245 --> 20:56.998
Really? I don't.

20:57.334 --> 20:59.325
Well, it would have been great.

20:59.587 --> 21:02.545
I'll see you, Sam.
I'm gonna go get my things.

21:03.551 --> 21:05.542
Oh, boy.

21:10.396 --> 21:12.785
Sam, this has gotta be the
strangest night of my life.

21:13.067 --> 21:14.864
Yeah, it must be
something in the air.

21:15.112 --> 21:17.580
Boy, I don't even know
how to bring this up, but...

21:17.866 --> 21:19.902
Well, there was a guy
sitting at the bar,

21:20.162 --> 21:21.754
said he was from the Harvard Club.

21:21.998 --> 21:23.795
Wait a minute. Here's his card.

21:24.085 --> 21:26.724
Anyway, he said he
liked the cut of my jib,

21:27.006 --> 21:29.395
and he asked me
if I wanna go and work for him.

21:29.677 --> 21:32.350
Now the money he's offering
would be hard to turn down.

21:32.641 --> 21:34.199
- Sam?
- Woody!

21:34.477 --> 21:37.310
I swear to uphold
the bylaws of the lodge

21:37.607 --> 21:40.565
and to defend
the dignity of the herd.

21:41.029 --> 21:43.702
Woody, Woody, Woody. Wait, wait,
wait, man. Wait, wait, wait.

21:43.992 --> 21:45.789
Listen, there's somebody
in the bar here,

21:46.037 --> 21:48.107
somebody from the Harvard Club,
who wants to hire Ken,

21:48.373 --> 21:49.522
so you don't have to leave.

21:49.751 --> 21:52.311
I mean, just get back
behind the bar, man.

21:52.589 --> 21:54.545
God. What a relief.

21:57.138 --> 21:58.253
Wait a minute, Sam.

21:59.475 --> 22:00.874
What?

22:01.353 --> 22:02.991
What do you think I am?

22:04.984 --> 22:07.817
I got fired from a job that
means more to me

22:08.114 --> 22:09.388
than anything else in the world,

22:09.617 --> 22:11.528
and you want me to just come
walking back in here

22:11.786 --> 22:14.619
because Ken wants to leave?

22:14.958 --> 22:16.516
Well, I can't do that.

22:17.671 --> 22:20.026
Listen, I need you.

22:20.300 --> 22:23.610
Please, isn't there anything
I can do to change your mind here?

22:26.477 --> 22:28.468
- Hundred-dollar-a-month raise?
- Hundred dollars?

22:28.772 --> 22:31.445
No, no, Woody, wait, wait.

22:31.734 --> 22:33.326
I need you.

22:33.863 --> 22:35.854
Yeah, okay, a hundred bucks.

22:36.451 --> 22:37.964
- It's a deal.
- Yeah.

22:38.203 --> 22:40.080
All right.

22:41.584 --> 22:46.055
Boy, yeah, you know,
you really surprised me here. I--

22:46.425 --> 22:47.938
You're a pretty tough negotiator.

22:48.178 --> 22:52.012
Yeah, Sam, boy, I know you think
I'm just a country bumpkin.

22:52.518 --> 22:55.988
And the Boyd family may not be too
sharp about a lot of things.

22:56.316 --> 22:57.954
I mean, we don't
know much about math.

22:58.194 --> 23:00.185
We don't know much
about science.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.165
We don't know much
about politics.

23:02.409 --> 23:04.365
We don't know much
about medicine.

23:04.621 --> 23:06.179
We don't know much
about world affairs,

23:06.416 --> 23:09.135
but I'll tell you, there's something
we're pretty darned sharp about.

23:09.420 --> 23:10.819
What's that?

23:12.091 --> 23:14.161
What were we talking about?

23:16.974 --> 23:18.089
Machinery.

23:18.310 --> 23:20.187
We don't know much
about machinery.

23:20.438 --> 23:23.475
I'll tell you, my uncle, he lost his arm
in some kind of contraption--

23:23.777 --> 23:25.130
Oh, you're kidding me.

23:25.488 --> 23:26.557
Wait a minute.

23:26.782 --> 23:28.295
- What? What?
- I remember.

23:28.534 --> 23:29.683
We were talking about money.

23:29.912 --> 23:31.868
That's right. That's right.

23:32.123 --> 23:36.753
We were talking about your
$50-a-month raise.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.951
Sam, it was 1 00 a month.

23:43.183 --> 23:45.492
But you know, I'll tell you.

23:46.313 --> 23:49.032
I think 100 a month is too steep.

23:49.986 --> 23:52.659
- I'll settle for 30 a week.
- You got it.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.470
Host/manager extraordinaire.
