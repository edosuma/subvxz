00:06.528 --> 00:08.747
<i>-It was just another day
as a crotch beetle </i>

00:08.791 --> 00:10.097
<i>in Trophy's vagina.</i>

00:10.140 --> 00:12.055
<i>I believe it was a Friday.</i>

00:12.099 --> 00:15.102
<i>Everyone was business
as usual -- replacing fluids, </i>

00:15.145 --> 00:17.365
<i>removing stray bottle caps,
that sort of thing. </i>

00:17.408 --> 00:19.193
<i>Everyone but me.</i>

00:19.236 --> 00:21.412
<i>Me, I've always been a dreamer.</i>

00:21.456 --> 00:22.674
Hey, Norma...

00:22.718 --> 00:24.328
you ever wonder
what it'd be like

00:24.372 --> 00:28.332
to venture into the great, wide,
non-vaginal world beyond?

00:28.376 --> 00:30.552
- Whaddaya mean? The feet?
- No, I mean...

00:30.595 --> 00:31.814
out there!

00:31.857 --> 00:33.555
- No, why would I?

00:33.598 --> 00:37.080
Trophy's roomy ladycave contains
everything we could ever need --

00:37.124 --> 00:40.736
shelter, barbiturates,
Fun Hat Fridays --

00:40.779 --> 00:42.042
- The basics, yes.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.826
But don't you have dreams?

00:43.869 --> 00:46.307
- Hat on, Martina!

00:46.350 --> 00:48.004
Stop your whimsy!

00:48.048 --> 00:50.572
Remember whose vag
you're living in.

00:50.615 --> 00:54.184
<i>-I don't know how I'm gonna
do it, but one day... </i>

00:54.228 --> 00:57.274
<i>I'm gonna live in
a little crotch of my very own. </i>

01:28.697 --> 01:30.655
Is that any good?

01:32.004 --> 01:33.354
- Good morning, students.

01:33.397 --> 01:36.618
I'm Mr. BJ Educator,
your substitute teacher.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.142
So, for the rest of the year,
we'll be watching

01:39.186 --> 01:44.234
the thought-provoking film
"Remember the Titans."

01:44.278 --> 01:46.845
- But we're already watching it
in science class.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.456
Mrs. Gilman is going through
a divorce,

01:48.499 --> 01:50.458
and it's the best
she can do right now.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.677
<i>-Principal Shepler here
with your Thank the Lord </i>

01:52.721 --> 01:55.506
<i>and Savior Jesus Christ
It's Friday announcements! </i>

01:55.550 --> 01:58.422
<i>Coach Kitman's trial will be
broadcast live </i>

01:58.466 --> 02:00.250
<i>in the auditorium on Monday.</i>

02:00.294 --> 02:02.034
<i>Wear green if you think
he's guilty </i>

02:02.078 --> 02:05.168
<i>and blue if you have first-hand
knowledge of his guilt. </i>

02:05.212 --> 02:08.432
<i>So, we're canceling tonight's
football game and pep rally </i>

02:08.476 --> 02:11.392
<i>and showing the film
"Remember the Titans" instead. </i>

02:11.435 --> 02:15.135
<i>Hope you remember
to bring your school spirit. </i>

02:15.178 --> 02:18.442
- At this point, I'd really like
to forget the Titans.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.271
- If I forget the Titans,
will you please remind me?

02:21.315 --> 02:22.881
- Ha! You're fun.

02:22.925 --> 02:25.841
- Sometimes, life is fun
for no reason at all.

02:27.495 --> 02:30.411
I know it'll be lame,
but want to sit with me tonight?

02:30.454 --> 02:32.239
- I don't scratch my head
unless it itches,

02:32.282 --> 02:34.241
I don't dance
unless I hear some music,

02:34.284 --> 02:37.635
and I don't go to the movies
unless someone asks me!

02:37.679 --> 02:39.681
- Sweet Denzel impresh!

02:39.724 --> 02:41.248
You do anyone else?

02:41.291 --> 02:44.294
- Isn't it ironic...
but I don't.

02:44.338 --> 02:47.776
- Can't wait for you
to meet my peeps.

02:47.819 --> 02:50.431
- I mean, Javi and I have texted
about homework four times,

02:50.474 --> 02:52.563
sat at the same table
at lunch three times,

02:52.607 --> 02:55.087
and today, they asked me
to friend third base --

02:55.131 --> 02:57.046
watching a movie at <i>night.</i>

02:57.089 --> 02:59.309
- Sorry, hon, I need you
to babysit the beetles tonight.

02:59.353 --> 03:03.270
I've got my first real <i>date
date post-resurrection,</i>

03:03.313 --> 03:06.360
and I can't have bugs
in my jelly roll.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.926
- But you know
I've always dreamed

03:07.970 --> 03:09.754
of being part of a squad.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.147
That's not fair.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.670
<i>-I'm</i> not fair, Annie.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.150
This guy could be the one.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.370
He's a..."art clown".

03:16.413 --> 03:18.459
Real stepdad material!

03:18.502 --> 03:20.722
- Can't Baba or Pete
watch the beetles?

03:20.765 --> 03:22.158
- It's Friday, Annie.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.421
Old country
mother/son date night.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.771
- Oh, right.
But don't you need the beetles

03:26.815 --> 03:29.470
to stop you
from literally falling apart?

03:29.513 --> 03:31.515
- I have no idea, Annie.

03:31.559 --> 03:35.911
My body is a mystery
only an art clown can solve.

03:35.954 --> 03:38.740
- Why did I think this Friday
would be any different?

03:38.783 --> 03:40.524
"Annie, babysit the beetles.

03:40.568 --> 03:43.135
Annie, wear this wig
and meet with my parole officer.

03:43.179 --> 03:46.313
Annie, go make another season
of 'Mad Men.' I'm bored."

03:46.356 --> 03:48.837
I'm so mad, I could sigh!

03:48.880 --> 03:50.317
- Yikes.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.449
Trophy doesn't call her
"The Drain" for nothing.

03:52.493 --> 03:53.798
- Annie's not a drain.

03:53.842 --> 03:56.279
She's a faucet of hopes
and dreams.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.368
Let's help her.

03:58.412 --> 04:03.155
- That tickles! Whoa!

04:03.199 --> 04:05.157
I guess Coach Kitman
was right -- for some people,

04:05.201 --> 04:07.551
the most flattering outfit
is a large sweatshirt.

04:07.595 --> 04:10.032
But I can't look incredible
and go out in public.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.903
I think that's an either/or.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.341
Thanks anyway, guys.
- What gives?

04:14.384 --> 04:16.299
We just pulled a full Cinderella
on her,

04:16.343 --> 04:17.779
and now she wants to stay home?

04:17.822 --> 04:19.998
You're a bleeding heart
for losers, Martina.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.131
- What a waste of a fun hat!

04:22.174 --> 04:24.525
- She's just used to crushing
her own dreams

04:24.568 --> 04:27.354
before the world
or her mother gets a chance to.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.007
We have to spell it out for her.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.574
- Yay!

04:30.618 --> 04:32.315
- Oh! Okay!

04:32.359 --> 04:34.796
I guess you'll be
my emotional support beetles!

04:34.839 --> 04:37.233
Here, hop in my Jansport.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.148
Wait, stop!

04:39.191 --> 04:41.846
I'm talking about my backpack!

04:41.890 --> 04:45.197
Besides, that would be
my <i>frontpack.</i>

04:47.417 --> 04:49.289
- See?

04:49.332 --> 04:52.335
You <i>can</i> make meatloaf
and give foot rub at same time.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.903
Peter, why you no give bunion
the tickle-tickle?

04:54.946 --> 04:58.036
- Don't get me wrong, I love
being a slave to the matriarchy,

04:58.080 --> 05:01.344
but sometimes, I wish
I had a guy pal to hang with.

05:01.388 --> 05:05.392
- Male friendship not for shy
undertaker grown boys, Peter.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.046
You never leave the Baba.
- Special delivery.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.353
Mr. Peter Fantasy.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.269
- What this?
Too small to be bride.

05:13.313 --> 05:17.273
Any package that not for work
and not bride for pervert.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.669
- Not <i>perverts, Baba -- loners.</i>

05:21.712 --> 05:22.931
<i>-I'm Gymnast Gregory.</i>

05:22.974 --> 05:24.628
<i>Wanna see my front roundoff?</i>

05:24.672 --> 05:26.891
- There's something wrong
with this wife, Peter.

05:26.935 --> 05:30.242
If she no get pregnant
in 90 days, we return.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.853
- Gregory's not my lover.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.420
He's here to be my friend.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.422
See?

05:35.465 --> 05:37.685
<i>-Men die an average of
five years earlier than women. </i>

05:37.728 --> 05:38.947
<i>Loneliness is
one of the biggest threats </i>

05:38.990 --> 05:40.644
<i>to men's health.</i>

05:40.688 --> 05:42.951
<i>But Gymnast Gregory,
our companion smart doll, </i>

05:42.994 --> 05:44.822
<i>is here to help.</i>

05:44.866 --> 05:47.303
<i>-While we watch the game,
let's do a somatic inventory </i>

05:47.347 --> 05:49.349
<i>of the places
our bodies carry tension. </i>

05:49.392 --> 05:50.567
- I'd like that, Greg.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.047
<i>-As a professional athlete,</i>

05:52.090 --> 05:53.831
<i>Gymnast Gregory
creates intimacy </i>

05:53.875 --> 05:56.878
<i>within a nonthreatening
sports-based bond. </i>

05:56.921 --> 05:58.140
<i>-Tell me about the frustrations
you feel </i>

05:58.183 --> 05:59.663
<i>with your manager at work.</i>

05:59.707 --> 06:01.361
<i>I love hearing you
talk about the situation </i>

06:01.404 --> 06:02.971
<i>yet never do anything
to change it. </i>

06:03.014 --> 06:05.887
<i>-He can flip, cartwheel,
and help males over 18 </i>

06:05.930 --> 06:09.107
<i>experience vulnerability
with another man. </i>

06:09.151 --> 06:11.458
- Most things I need to get off
my chest are too embarrassing

06:11.501 --> 06:14.417
to share with other men
and too boring for human women.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.941
<i>-Sharing your feelings can help
lower your blood pressure </i>

06:16.985 --> 06:19.422
<i>and make you less inclined
to yell at strangers. </i>

06:19.466 --> 06:22.382
<i>In a double-blind study,
Gymnast Gregory owners </i>

06:22.425 --> 06:24.775
<i>were 17% less likely
to murder women </i>

06:24.819 --> 06:27.169
<i>who rejected
their sexual advances. </i>

06:27.212 --> 06:28.605
- I didn't understand
the importance

06:28.649 --> 06:30.128
of straight male friendship

06:30.172 --> 06:32.609
when it came to my depression,
but I do now.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.872
Thank you, Gymnast Gregory.

06:34.916 --> 06:38.354
- But lonely middle-aged men
some of our best customers.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.095
<i>-Spot me on the balance beam!</i>

06:40.138 --> 06:42.750
<i>Then I'll help you confront
the inadequacy you feel </i>

06:42.793 --> 06:44.447
<i>when you pee sitting down.</i>

06:44.491 --> 06:47.319
You mean standing is an option?!

06:47.363 --> 06:50.192
Having a male friend
is gonna be great!

06:50.235 --> 06:52.324
- Peter, you no need boyfriend

06:52.368 --> 06:57.155
when you have good job
and lubed-up Baba.

06:57.199 --> 07:00.158
- Didn't realize mimes
are technically art clowns.

07:05.512 --> 07:08.471
How 'd you know I love
gas-station flowers?

07:11.518 --> 07:13.781
And horse tranquilizers.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.565
He's mine. Oh, he's mine.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.350
- Good evening. Ready to order?

07:18.394 --> 07:21.571
Oh! Okay, two words.

07:21.615 --> 07:24.748
Uh, you're a...chicken...

07:24.792 --> 07:26.446
- Newborn kitten!
- Breastfeeding!

07:26.489 --> 07:28.535
- The Vietnam War!
- Tender!

07:28.578 --> 07:30.624
- Oh, chicken tenders!
Chicken tenders!

07:32.364 --> 07:34.802
And what kind of sauce
would you like with that sir?

07:34.845 --> 07:37.500
Three words...
- Just bring us one of each.

07:37.544 --> 07:41.112
And I'll take a hamburger patty
soaked in vodka.

07:41.156 --> 07:44.420
Geeze latoosh, it's barely been
an hour without my beetles.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.987
Better put a jump on the hump.

07:46.030 --> 07:49.164
Francois, how bout we skip
straight to dessert?

07:49.207 --> 07:52.950
They have a wonderful
back alley here, and so do I.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.432
- Good turnout!

07:56.476 --> 07:59.000
Surprised the recycling club
came as the segregationist mob,

07:59.043 --> 08:01.568
but they do enjoying
separating things.

08:04.222 --> 08:07.008
Oh, no, there go
my social-anxiety hives.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.618
Better just go home.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.795
Hey...what are you doing?

08:11.839 --> 08:14.624
Wow, you just superficially
covered them up.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.409
I guess that's what Trophy does
with all her flaws.

08:17.453 --> 08:18.759
- Annie, hey!

08:18.802 --> 08:22.632
Reminder -- the Titans!
Remember?

08:22.676 --> 08:24.982
- Oops, I, uh, almost forgot.

08:25.026 --> 08:26.331
- I'm Safety Pin.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.898
My thing's safety pins.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.596
- I'm Babygirl.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.250
My thing's sucking a pacifier
dipped in cough syrup.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.601
I've really
internalized misogyny

08:34.644 --> 08:36.603
and totally missed
the point of "Lolita"...

08:36.646 --> 08:38.605
for now!
- Cool!

08:38.648 --> 08:40.041
Javi, what's your thing?

08:40.084 --> 08:41.825
- I'm into
post-colonial feminism,

08:41.869 --> 08:44.088
but I don't have
a visual signifier for it yet,

08:44.132 --> 08:45.568
and long Furbys.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.832
- What's your thing, Annie?
- My thing is...

08:48.876 --> 08:52.270
looking at the ground and --
and -- and -- and...

08:52.314 --> 08:54.621
- Hey, Martina!
Get your head in the game!

08:54.664 --> 08:58.581
Playing fairy godmother to
The Drain was <i>your</i> idea!

08:58.625 --> 09:00.235
- And mystery.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.324
My thing is mystery.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.587
- I told you,
she is full of surprises.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.849
- Nice.
- Meta.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.462
- How ironic would nachos be?

09:10.506 --> 09:14.423
- I could really dip my pacifier
in some cheese right now.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.080
- Oh...

09:19.123 --> 09:20.342
actually, would you like
some nachos?

09:20.385 --> 09:23.780
- You <i>are</i> mysterious.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.870
- Annie overcoming her fears
and Denzel on the big screen --

09:26.914 --> 09:29.830
doesn't it all just make a girl
dream of a better world?

09:29.873 --> 09:32.876
- Hope it's a world
where you shut the hell up.

09:35.444 --> 09:36.663
- Table for two, sir?

09:36.706 --> 09:38.316
Or will your mother
be spying on you

09:38.360 --> 09:40.057
from the car again this evening?

09:40.101 --> 09:42.190
- Two for the all-male section,
please.

09:42.233 --> 09:46.890
We're here to experience
positive platonic masculinity.

09:46.934 --> 09:49.197
- Perhaps something
by the septic tan--

09:49.240 --> 09:50.633
<i>-Could you tell me all about</i>

09:50.677 --> 09:53.157
<i>exactly how whiskey
gets distilled? </i>

09:53.201 --> 09:55.116
- Oh, my apologies Mr. Gregory.

09:55.159 --> 09:59.163
I didn't see you there.
Please follow me.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.905
- So, buddy,
what should we discuss first?

10:01.949 --> 10:04.125
Deck remodels?
Automotive repair?

10:04.168 --> 10:06.954
Having spare keys made?

10:06.997 --> 10:09.521
<i>-We could start by listing NFL
quarterback record-holders, </i>

10:09.565 --> 10:11.523
<i>but the real touchdown would be
you sharing </i>

10:11.567 --> 10:12.960
<i>what's bothering you tonight.</i>

10:13.003 --> 10:14.526
- Me?

10:14.570 --> 10:16.354
No one's ever talked to me
about sports trivia

10:16.398 --> 10:20.707
or asked me how I feel before!

10:20.750 --> 10:22.665
Mommies.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.494
One minute, you're happily
snuggled up in their womb,

10:25.537 --> 10:27.278
the next, you're 31

10:27.322 --> 10:29.759
and they don't trust you to go
have a drink with a male friend.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.674
<i>-Wow. Thanks for
opening up like that. </i>

10:31.718 --> 10:34.546
- Baba's only ever thanked me
for shutting my face hole!

10:34.590 --> 10:37.114
Cheers to male friendship.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.726
- Just close your eyes
and hold still --

10:39.769 --> 10:42.380
it's best if I'm
the only one who moves.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.861
Oops.
There we go. Okay.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.689
Mm.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.951
How can we

10:47.995 --> 10:49.605
if you're trapped
in an invisible box!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.563
Let me in!

10:54.436 --> 10:57.221
How am I supposed to
get home now?

10:57.265 --> 10:58.788
Oh!

10:58.832 --> 11:00.834
Ooh!

11:03.750 --> 11:06.927
I guess without the beetles,
I don't quite work right.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.232
I'll call Annie.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.758
Daughters should be good
for something.

11:11.801 --> 11:15.544
Huh, I really need
those beetles.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.244
Damn it!

11:20.288 --> 11:22.769
Welp, it's all downhill
from here.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.083
<i>-And that is why
we will always... </i>

11:33.127 --> 11:35.216
<i>-Remember the Titans.</i>

11:37.000 --> 11:38.393
- What are you up to tomorrow,
Annie?

11:38.436 --> 11:39.960
- Tomorrow? Tomorrow?

11:45.226 --> 11:47.532
- Mm, not your best.
- Right, yeah, I know.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.447
- Well, we'll be at
the skatepark in the morning.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.101
Hope to see ya there.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.450
- Plans on a Saturday morning,

11:52.494 --> 11:54.757
right after plans
on a Friday night?

11:54.801 --> 11:57.238
Who knew I was "that bitch"?

11:57.281 --> 11:59.240
Couldn't have done it
without you guys!

11:59.283 --> 12:01.764
- Okay, everybody,
let's get some shut-eye!

12:01.808 --> 12:04.985
Don't forget, we've got a vagina
to rebuild bright and early.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.638
It's probably gonna be
absolutely wrecked

12:06.682 --> 12:08.640
by clown penis.
- Yay!

12:08.684 --> 12:10.642
- Who's excited for
Infrastructure Week!

12:10.686 --> 12:12.775
- Me!
- Not I.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.038
Like Annie,
I want more out of life.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.258
I've actually written some
free-verse I'd like to share

12:17.301 --> 12:19.086
on the topic of my dreams.

12:19.129 --> 12:22.089
'Twas the night I discovered -
- That's enough out of you.

12:22.132 --> 12:24.004
Tomorrow, you're on anus watch.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.615
- But I'm a terrible goalie.
You've said it yourself.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.797
Hmm, you're wet and bumpy.
This could work out.

12:34.841 --> 12:39.497
I have an excellent franchise
opportunity inside my vagina.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.065
Can you go round up
some of your friends?

12:42.109 --> 12:47.897
Hear me, frogs of the forest,
take me home!

12:54.861 --> 12:58.386
- Beetles! Beetles?
I need your help.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.867
Faking social adequacy
during a movie is one thing,

13:00.910 --> 13:03.695
but a skate park
in the cold light of day...

13:03.739 --> 13:05.523
I'm not sure I'm up to this!

13:05.567 --> 13:07.308
Ahhh!

13:07.351 --> 13:09.527
Who said you could
sleep in there?

13:09.571 --> 13:11.965
- I was cold, and I took
her gentle snoring as consent.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.618
- Me, too.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.708
- Where the hell is Trophy!

13:16.752 --> 13:18.754
Us crotch beetles
keep her alive.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.712
Plus, without her constantly
ordering us around,

13:20.756 --> 13:22.192
the hive is beginning to spiral.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.194
- I for one say
we keep helping Annie.

13:24.238 --> 13:26.588
She and I are kindred souls.

13:26.631 --> 13:30.157
- Okay, at least it'll keep the
masses busy 'til Trophy returns.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.419
Hey, beetles!

13:31.462 --> 13:34.117
Let's make 'er up!
- Yay!

13:38.252 --> 13:41.342
- I look like a self-confident
suburban teen trying to rebel

13:41.385 --> 13:44.519
against understanding parents
who love her.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.303
And you made me a skateboard

13:46.347 --> 13:48.740
out of the lid
of a baby coffin?!

13:48.784 --> 13:52.570
I'm so freaking mysterious!

13:52.614 --> 13:54.224
- Annie, Annie!

13:54.268 --> 13:55.747
Have you seen Peter?

13:55.791 --> 13:58.141
Baba wait hour
for Saturday breakfast in bed,

13:58.185 --> 14:00.622
but no tuna sandwich,
no morning love letter,

14:00.665 --> 14:02.102
no Petey!

14:02.145 --> 14:04.669
- Trophy never came home
last night, either.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.584
- It all Gymnast Gregory fault.

14:06.628 --> 14:10.588
This why Baba always warn
you kids -- no make friends.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.764
- Actually...
I made some friends last night.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.375
The beetles and I are on our way

14:14.418 --> 14:16.377
to meet them
at the skate park now.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.945
- Annie, this no time
to crack jokes.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.773
You sweet social outcast
like your uncle.

14:21.817 --> 14:25.299
Weekends are for family,
not make-believe friends.

14:30.565 --> 14:33.960
Whew, made it back
on some pollywog power!

14:34.003 --> 14:35.962
You can clock out now.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.835
Alright, beetles,
assemble the pit crew!

14:39.879 --> 14:41.402
Putting Humpy Trophy
back together again

14:41.445 --> 14:43.099
is gonna take days.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.407
Beetles? Anyone?

14:46.450 --> 14:49.018
C'mon, I know <i>you're</i> home,
Annie.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.020
It's the weekend!

14:53.066 --> 14:56.069
Uh-oh. Get back here.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.331
- Is this your tongue?

14:57.374 --> 14:58.898
Be more careful!

14:58.941 --> 15:00.987
- Where's Annie
and my crotch beetles?

15:01.030 --> 15:02.858
- If you can't date men
who treat you right,

15:02.902 --> 15:05.992
you really should just spend
Friday nights with Petey and me.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.389
- Hey, Baba.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.826
Sorry I missed breakfast,
but Gregory and I

15:14.870 --> 15:16.524
went to see
a Christopher Nolan movie

15:16.567 --> 15:18.134
and then drove around all night

15:18.178 --> 15:20.832
quoting lines from
other Christopher Nolan movies.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.486
Sorry.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.010
- You mean you stay up all night

15:24.053 --> 15:26.360
breaking
your worried mother's heart.

15:26.403 --> 15:29.058
<i>-I'm supposed to practice
my back hand springs, </i>

15:29.102 --> 15:31.060
<i>but I'm all ears
if you wanna go off </i>

15:31.104 --> 15:33.671
<i>on all the ways your mother's
emotionally blackmailing you. </i>

15:35.717 --> 15:38.850
<i>She's not the hero
Gotham needs, Pete. </i>

15:38.894 --> 15:40.200
- Be warned, Petey.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.767
Funeral home no place
for male gymnast.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.639
I have known quite a few.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.859
They steal your shoes
and trade for steroids,

15:47.903 --> 15:51.385
but the Baba know
you want man-friend.

15:51.428 --> 15:54.518
There someone
I want you to meet.

15:54.562 --> 15:57.652
- Oh, my.
- This Petetini.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.915
Baba make smarter doll.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.918
He good boy like you.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.702
<i>-Let's make Mother
French toast, </i>

16:04.746 --> 16:07.575
<i>then sniff all her babushkas
'til we find the one </i>

16:07.618 --> 16:10.056
<i>that smells like her hair
in the rain. </i>

16:10.099 --> 16:12.145
<i>Maybe Gregory should leave.</i>

16:12.188 --> 16:14.103
<i>He scares me, Pete.</i>

16:14.147 --> 16:15.887
<i>-I only listen, not judge.</i>

16:15.931 --> 16:18.455
<i>Judging is for the Olympics.
- Oh, no.</i>

16:18.499 --> 16:20.240
This is the ultimate
loner's dilemma!

16:27.116 --> 16:29.684
- Wow, Annie!
Nice Caballerial.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.555
- Nice eyebrow safety pin.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.514
- Love your baby-coffin board.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.472
- Oh, my gosh, I'm doing it!

16:35.516 --> 16:37.822
Nothing can take this
away from me!

16:37.866 --> 16:39.346
- Sorry, kids.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.478
We've got to close down
the skate park today.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.132
It's for
the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.742
- Aw, the park needs to be empty

16:44.786 --> 16:46.527
because their immune system's
compromised?

16:46.570 --> 16:48.007
- No.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.312
Their wish was to make
other children angry

16:49.356 --> 16:51.488
by closing the park.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.360
Mean kids get cancer, too.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.622
Everybody out!

16:54.665 --> 16:56.319
All of you, outta here.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.800
- Now what?
We can't go to my house.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.368
My parents are hoarders.
- My dad's a mime.

17:01.411 --> 17:04.284
It takes him like six hours
to pantomime invisible snacks.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.068
- We could go to my house.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.549
But my whole family is baby
and we live in a giant crib.

17:08.592 --> 17:09.985
It was cool at first.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.943
- Oh, well, maybe tomorrow.
See you later.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.207
- Bye-bye.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.730
- Oh.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.732
I've never
had friends over before,

17:17.775 --> 17:20.430
but I guess
it's technically possible.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.824
Hey, guys!
We could go to my house.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.914
- Coo-coo.

17:25.957 --> 17:29.091
- Must be kinda weird to live
in a funeral home.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.571
- Shhh -- it's better

17:30.614 --> 17:33.313
if we don't disturb Baba
mid-embalm.

17:33.356 --> 17:34.575
- Annie? That you?

17:34.618 --> 17:36.098
Your mother need
vagina bugs back.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.360
Her foot fall off.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.060
Blah blah blah,
typical mortician talk.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.278
This way!

17:43.627 --> 17:44.889
- What's that noise?

17:46.282 --> 17:48.763
- Is this your family?
They're cute.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.504
- I know you said mystery
was your thing,

17:50.547 --> 17:52.593
but clearly, you're a frog girl.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.335
- Annie!

17:58.207 --> 18:00.514
- Too mysterious,
too mysterious!

18:00.557 --> 18:02.124
- Wait! Don't leave!

18:02.168 --> 18:04.866
We could play Wii or go hang out
in the corpse freezer.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.172
My thing isn't frogs!

18:06.215 --> 18:07.434
It's actually friendship.

18:07.477 --> 18:11.133
Friendship is my thing!

18:12.656 --> 18:17.008
Mom, what exactly happens
on a date?

18:17.052 --> 18:19.228
- I didn't realize
my crotch beetles

18:19.272 --> 18:21.230
make up my entire skeleton.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.711
I need them back pronto, Annie!

18:23.754 --> 18:26.322
- For what it's worth,
they are really great beetles.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.150
They even helped me
make some friends.

18:28.194 --> 18:31.022
The friends are, of course,
gone now, but at one point

18:31.066 --> 18:34.330
in the last two days, I can say
I had up to three friends.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.202
- I think that ran its course.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.638
C'mon home, beetles.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.901
Mama needs you!

18:39.944 --> 18:41.424
- C'mon, beetles!

18:41.468 --> 18:43.252
We've gotta raise
this broad's barn!

18:43.296 --> 18:45.559
Everybody in! Martina?

18:45.602 --> 18:47.126
Martina? You coming?

18:47.169 --> 18:48.779
- You know what? I'm not.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.477
We both knew this day
would come, Norma.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.956
This is goodbye.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.438
- Well, I'll leave the cervix
open for you.

18:55.482 --> 18:59.225
- Thanks a lot
for babysitting, Annie.

18:59.268 --> 19:02.228
- Annie! Hey, Annie.

19:02.271 --> 19:06.362
- I'm Martina, and I just
have to say, you are so cool.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.799
- I am?
- Oh, yeah.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.192
You want something
more out of life

19:10.236 --> 19:12.803
than just serving Trophy,
and so do I.

19:12.847 --> 19:15.066
- Are you going to be my beetle
from now on?

19:15.110 --> 19:18.244
- No, I'm leaving
to find my path.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.202
I'm a dreamer, just like you.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.421
But listen, Annie.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.336
One day, you'll get out of here,

19:23.379 --> 19:26.252
and until then, you should
really give Javi a call.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.210
Just tell them your thing
is haunted houses.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.559
- Thanks.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.039
And good luck
fulfilling your dreams.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.823
- Oh, I will.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.956
You know, I've been workshopping
some singer-songwriter stuff,

19:34.999 --> 19:36.697
and I'd really love
to share with --

19:36.740 --> 19:40.483
- I think I'm just gonna
go make that call.

19:40.527 --> 19:43.878
<i>-Don't be such a dreamer,
Gregory. </i>

19:43.921 --> 19:46.576
<i>Thanks to me, Pete is working
on his self-respect </i>

19:46.620 --> 19:48.099
<i>and recognizing
the toxic patterns </i>

19:48.143 --> 19:49.666
<i>that are keeping him stuck.</i>

19:49.710 --> 19:52.452
<i>-Gymnast Gregory,
my critique of you</i>

19:52.495 --> 19:57.500
<i>is that you cannot walk plain,
always doing flips. </i>

19:57.544 --> 20:00.590
<i>Just like you cannot
accept Pete plain. </i>

20:00.634 --> 20:04.725
<i>You have him doing flips
of personality. </i>

20:04.768 --> 20:07.728
- That's actually true.
Petetini makes a lot of sense.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.382
<i>-You know what I love
about you, Pete, </i>

20:09.425 --> 20:13.037
<i>even your big feelings
can't frighten me off. </i>

20:13.081 --> 20:14.996
- Oh,
that's such a relief, Gregory.

20:15.039 --> 20:18.652
I was worried if I told you
about my abandonment issues,

20:18.695 --> 20:21.132
you'd abandon me,
just like that.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.134
<i>-Wee!</i>

20:23.178 --> 20:25.963
- And you've abandoned me,
just like that.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.139
<i>Petetini not leave.</i>

20:28.183 --> 20:30.316
- I paid for
a male friendship doll

20:30.359 --> 20:33.144
with anti-abandonment
programming

20:33.188 --> 20:36.974
that could never walk out on me
like my father did.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.976
- Peter, my only boy.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.544
Keep boring feelings to self,
'kay?

20:41.588 --> 20:43.720
<i>-I embarrassed for you.</i>

20:47.071 --> 20:48.290
- Have the beetles said
when they'll be done

20:48.334 --> 20:49.683
with the reconstruction?

20:49.726 --> 20:51.075
- They're contractors.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.295
Whatever they say,
add six weeks.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.776
Since I'm stuck at home,
how about we watch that

20:55.819 --> 20:59.823
"Remember the Beauticians" movie
you're always blathering about?

20:59.867 --> 21:03.262
- Sorry, I'm meeting Javi and
the girls in front of the 911.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.654
I worried they'd never
talk to me again,

21:04.698 --> 21:06.047
but they seem sort of fascinated

21:06.090 --> 21:08.702
by a haunted funeral home
being my thing.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.181
- Where you two off to?

21:10.225 --> 21:12.749
Saturday nights,
we clean sink drains

21:12.793 --> 21:15.578
and listen to podcasts
of people playing Scrabble.

21:15.622 --> 21:18.015
- Actually, Baba, Petetini and I
are going to go drink

21:18.059 --> 21:20.322
some light beer out of cans.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.368
It's really important
that we take some time

21:22.411 --> 21:25.936
to recharge
our masculine energy.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.591
- Should have never had kids.
- Should have never had kids.

21:33.117 --> 21:36.120
- She's not coming back, Norma.

21:36.164 --> 21:38.514
- Who would have thought
I'd miss that crazy dreamer.

21:38.558 --> 21:41.038
- Well, you're about to miss
Silly Shirt Saturday!

21:41.082 --> 21:42.518
Get in here!

21:42.562 --> 21:45.086
- Here's to you, Martina.

21:45.129 --> 21:47.610
You keep dreaming
those big dreams.

21:47.654 --> 21:50.047
Enough for all us
crotch beetles.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.835
<i>-And that's the story
of how I went from living </i>

21:54.878 --> 21:56.837
<i>in an overcrowded corpse vagina</i>

21:56.880 --> 22:00.231
<i>to living in
a small plastic gymnast. </i>

22:00.275 --> 22:02.625
<i>Never, ever give up
on your dreams. </i>
