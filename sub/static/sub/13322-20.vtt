00:01.596 --> 00:03.790
Mr. Harvey says that
Callie broke into his house.

00:03.797 --> 00:05.740
If the DA finds out,
you're gonna go to prison.

00:05.752 --> 00:07.634
There was more DNA on the murder weapon.

00:07.950 --> 00:09.320
Watch out!

00:09.355 --> 00:10.343
She's under arrest.

00:10.356 --> 00:11.722
Vehicular assault and
a felony hit and run.

00:11.725 --> 00:13.658
I know you killed your grandmother,
and we're gonna prove it.

00:13.693 --> 00:15.987
- You're crazy.
- I can't do this anymore.

00:16.032 --> 00:18.217
If you help us build a
case against your pimp,

00:18.244 --> 00:19.356
we're gonna put him behind bars.

00:19.379 --> 00:21.766
It's me, Diamond. You can come get me.

00:21.801 --> 00:24.820
There are so many unknowns
about traumatic brain injuries.

00:24.829 --> 00:26.076
- Emma's pregnant?
- No!

00:26.099 --> 00:27.772
She isn't pregnant anymore.

00:27.807 --> 00:30.045
I just can't face him and
not tell him the truth,

00:30.067 --> 00:31.626
so I wrote him this.

00:32.342 --> 00:33.838
You can't read it, can you?

00:33.860 --> 00:35.680
They're trying to turn Anchor
Beach into a private school.

00:35.715 --> 00:37.352
Wonder where this money is coming from.

00:37.388 --> 00:38.531
That's Craig Stratos.

00:38.541 --> 00:39.744
Did you hear about Anchor Beach?

00:39.762 --> 00:42.307
Frannie sent me a screen shot from
some anonymous Twitter account.

00:42.370 --> 00:44.010
I know you had an abortion,

00:44.037 --> 00:45.461
and that you didn't give Jesus a chance

00:45.462 --> 00:46.720
to tell you what he really wanted.

00:49.248 --> 00:50.284
Jesus?

00:51.464 --> 00:52.986
Jesus, are you listening to me?

00:54.768 --> 00:56.825
I can't afford to go to private school.

01:00.028 --> 01:01.676
You're pregnant, aren't you?

01:03.829 --> 01:05.682
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

01:06.321 --> 01:07.448
It's okay.

01:07.898 --> 01:10.155
You know this might sound crazy, but...

01:10.362 --> 01:11.569
we can do this.

01:12.038 --> 01:13.092
I'm... I'm ready.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.137
We can have this baby together.

01:18.725 --> 01:20.258
I had an abortion.

01:22.947 --> 01:24.562
Why didn't you tell me?

01:24.597 --> 01:26.222
Why didn't you talk to me?

01:27.037 --> 01:29.757
I'm adopted, Emma, you know that.

01:31.018 --> 01:34.338
I didn't talk to you,
because the baby wasn't yours.

01:36.776 --> 01:38.193
It was Brandon's.

_

02:03.653 --> 02:06.446
_

02:18.618 --> 02:20.090
So, what do we do now?

02:22.167 --> 02:24.595
Well, uh, there's no way

02:24.626 --> 02:27.257
a jury is going to see
Callie as sympathetic,

02:27.279 --> 02:29.794
or innocent after they see this.

02:30.329 --> 02:32.609
And the DA knows it, so they've...

02:32.789 --> 02:34.217
offered us a deal.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.416
It's not great.

02:36.669 --> 02:38.820
It's not even good to be honest,

02:39.059 --> 02:42.076
but it's the best we're going
to get under the circumstances.

02:43.905 --> 02:45.000
How long?

02:45.478 --> 02:46.777
Three years.

02:48.221 --> 02:50.991
We have until tomorrow to let them know.

02:51.342 --> 02:53.388
If you decide to accept the deal,

02:53.508 --> 02:57.280
surrender right away, and begin
serving your time immediately.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.457
I can't...

03:51.835 --> 03:54.371
I can't go to jail. I don't...

03:54.491 --> 03:56.434
- Please no, Mom.
- Okay. Hey, listen, listen.

03:56.465 --> 03:58.398
Take a deep breath, okay?

03:58.518 --> 04:00.271
It's okay, you're okay.

04:00.763 --> 04:02.245
Hey, we still have time.

04:02.267 --> 04:03.721
They don't need an
answer until tomorrow.

04:03.756 --> 04:06.290
We will find a way. This is not over.

04:06.326 --> 04:07.861
- It's not over.
- It is over.

04:07.893 --> 04:09.528
Everything is over.

04:14.163 --> 04:15.700
Um, can you...

04:17.370 --> 04:19.622
can you please not tell anyone at home?

04:19.644 --> 04:21.744
I... I... I don't want
them looking at me,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.460
and feeling sorry for me. I, um...

04:23.580 --> 04:25.126
- I'm scared enough, I don't want everyone...
- Yes, listen.

04:25.158 --> 04:28.432
It's fine that's, uh, this is
between us and Mama, alright?

04:29.536 --> 04:30.536
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:30.581 --> 04:32.833
Alright, let's get you
outta here. Let's go.

04:36.756 --> 04:37.755
Hi!

04:37.790 --> 04:39.496
You wrote about my...

04:39.896 --> 04:41.513
You wrote about me on Twitter?

04:41.694 --> 04:43.576
I just heard a couple of
kids trying to figure out

04:43.586 --> 04:44.726
who was pregnant in our class.

04:44.757 --> 04:47.532
Luckily for me, Natalie put
on a few pounds this year.

04:47.847 --> 04:50.617
How could you do that? To me? To Jesus?

04:50.652 --> 04:53.467
- No one knows it was me.
- I do!

04:53.840 --> 04:55.477
And Jesus will.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.352
No, he won't.

04:57.572 --> 04:59.710
He's never gonna find out
about it, because I deleted it.

04:59.746 --> 05:01.849
- The whole account.
- What if he already saw it?

05:01.903 --> 05:03.974
Don't you think if he saw it,
he would have said something?

05:04.150 --> 05:05.303
So, that's your big...

05:05.423 --> 05:07.537
solution? Hope that he didn't see it.

05:07.924 --> 05:09.329
Some friend you are.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.932
Three years?

05:15.486 --> 05:17.851
Oh my God, this is so unfair.

05:17.874 --> 05:19.009
I know.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.409
I know, love.

05:20.767 --> 05:23.013
Trust me, I'm gonna do everything
I can in the next 24 hours

05:23.040 --> 05:26.125
- to make sure this doesn't happen.
- Stef, what can you do in a day?

05:26.143 --> 05:28.647
Listen, I have to go.
Just... just try and relax.

05:28.674 --> 05:29.917
I will... I will call you later.

05:29.944 --> 05:31.818
Yeah. Drew!

05:32.097 --> 05:33.713
Were you leaving? I was
hoping to talk to you.

05:33.746 --> 05:35.078
Oh. I have a meeting.

05:35.155 --> 05:36.583
With Craig Stratos?

05:37.078 --> 05:38.186
Yeah.

05:38.785 --> 05:41.326
Do you have any idea
who that man really is?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.844
His son tormented my family,

05:43.871 --> 05:45.356
and brought a weapon to school,

05:45.391 --> 05:47.273
and then tried to blame
us for what happened.

05:47.322 --> 05:48.858
- He's doing this out of rev...
- I know

05:48.894 --> 05:52.105
that you have had some challenging
experiences with the Stratos family,

05:52.465 --> 05:55.610
but I promise you his
intentions here are good, okay?

05:55.635 --> 05:56.894
And, honestly, even if they aren't,

05:56.912 --> 05:58.907
the end result is gonna
be great for everyone.

05:58.938 --> 06:00.137
Oh, for everyone?

06:00.326 --> 06:03.190
What about families like mine who
can't afford Anchor Beach Academy?

06:03.204 --> 06:06.577
Lana, of course, your
kids will go here for free,

06:06.612 --> 06:08.663
and you'll be making
more money on top of it,

06:08.699 --> 06:11.331
and we won't have to worry about
all the politics of the school board,

06:11.343 --> 06:12.505
or writing grants.

06:12.518 --> 06:15.425
We'll have better arts,
better sports programs.

06:15.755 --> 06:18.195
Lana, this is our chance to
be a part of a world-class

06:18.204 --> 06:19.862
educational institution.

06:19.982 --> 06:22.439
Okay, first of all, my name is Lena.

06:22.695 --> 06:26.286
And secondly, I will be back
to work tomorrow full-time.

06:27.192 --> 06:29.188
Okay, yeah, good,

06:29.431 --> 06:32.670
but I'm gonna need you to do
your job and help manage this.

06:32.747 --> 06:34.657
Don't come back if you're
just gonna stir the pot.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.764
Kids are already threatening a
walk-out, and I have a feeling

06:36.778 --> 06:38.358
your daughter has a little
something to do with it.

06:38.372 --> 06:39.786
Hey, I have to go,

06:40.177 --> 06:43.159
but you... listen to me... Lena.

06:43.443 --> 06:46.799
You can get on board, be a
part of this, benefit from it,

06:46.821 --> 06:48.168
or you can step aside.

06:48.348 --> 06:50.536
The vote's tomorrow,
so this is happening.

06:50.563 --> 06:51.784
With or without you.

07:01.006 --> 07:02.452
Hey, I got your text. What's up?

07:02.479 --> 07:04.759
Hey. Come take a look at this.

07:08.533 --> 07:10.865
This is the nanny-cam footage
from Doug Harvey's house.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.573
He told us that he'd never
heard about Martha's murder.

07:13.595 --> 07:15.103
Well, that's clearly not true.

07:15.138 --> 07:16.886
He knows something, I mean, he has to.

07:16.905 --> 07:18.423
Otherwise, why would he lie to us?

07:19.707 --> 07:22.235
Obviously, I cannot look into this.

07:22.302 --> 07:23.827
Okay? It's a conflict of interest,

07:23.829 --> 07:24.894
and the last thing I wanna do

07:24.924 --> 07:27.661
is give Gray something
else to go to IA about.

07:27.675 --> 07:28.896
You got it.

07:29.364 --> 07:30.468
Thank you.

07:33.783 --> 07:34.954
Any word on Russell?

07:34.972 --> 07:36.598
Anything from Diamond's phone?

07:36.826 --> 07:39.954
Uhhh, no, but, uh,

07:40.013 --> 07:42.324
she told him that we
were talking to her.

07:42.482 --> 07:43.635
Maybe he's laying low.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.716
Oh my God, if he thinks
that she's talking to us...

07:45.770 --> 07:46.798
Should we move her?

07:46.838 --> 07:48.870
I mean, look what he
did to... to Brandi.

07:48.905 --> 07:51.518
Let's give it 24
hours. See what happens.

08:01.860 --> 08:03.630
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

08:11.027 --> 08:13.072
So, I need your help with something.

08:13.608 --> 08:15.897
We have to keep any protests,

08:15.932 --> 08:17.256
any response from the students,

08:17.283 --> 08:19.683
we have to keep things
calm and under control.

08:19.734 --> 08:21.694
Um, okay, but

08:21.919 --> 08:23.784
we have to make sure
our voices are heard.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.773
I know, I agree, and we're going to.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.393
There's a board meeting tomorrow night,

08:27.451 --> 08:29.789
and I was assured that the students
would have a place at the table.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.118
But in the meantime,

08:31.163 --> 08:32.895
- we can't have any chaos.
- _

08:32.897 --> 08:35.032
Okay? You guys can't
be walking out of class,

08:35.051 --> 08:36.784
or anything like that. Deal?

08:38.357 --> 08:39.854
Thank you.

08:41.352 --> 08:43.256
There is something else
that you should know.

08:45.343 --> 08:48.289
Nick's dad is the one
who is behind all of this.

08:48.352 --> 08:49.848
Wait, what?

08:50.596 --> 08:53.235
How? Nick doesn't even go here anymore.

08:53.777 --> 08:55.277
He's putting up the money.

08:59.380 --> 09:00.682
Come here.

09:07.633 --> 09:08.916
Hey, um...

09:09.349 --> 09:10.673
do you wanna go for a walk?

09:11.929 --> 09:13.015
Sure.

09:17.618 --> 09:19.213
I was wrong about Kyle.

09:22.339 --> 09:24.727
Pretty sure he killed that poor woman.

09:27.785 --> 09:29.664
I can't believe I...

09:30.272 --> 09:33.460
let myself get so
wrapped up in all of this.

09:33.465 --> 09:35.316
It was so stupid.

09:37.068 --> 09:40.081
So... what does that mean for you?

09:41.870 --> 09:42.942
Um...

09:43.149 --> 09:45.590
Well, the lawyer said
that if we go to trial,

09:45.640 --> 09:48.617
then we should say that, uh,

09:48.838 --> 09:51.653
that he manipulated me, and, and...

09:51.684 --> 09:54.067
convinced me all this crazy stuff, so...

09:55.548 --> 09:57.111
Do you think that'll work?

09:59.256 --> 10:00.864
Dunno. I hope so.

10:04.017 --> 10:05.283
Listen, um...

10:07.887 --> 10:09.720
I know you're going through

10:10.013 --> 10:11.922
kind of a tough time right now.

10:13.761 --> 10:15.382
You're finally pissed off.

10:16.211 --> 10:17.725
Which you have every right to be.

10:17.756 --> 10:22.134
You've had... a really raw
deal a lot of your life. Um.

10:24.294 --> 10:25.702
Just don't...

10:29.021 --> 10:30.877
Just don't be like me.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.715
No, I just mean, um...

10:33.769 --> 10:38.139
Like don't do... all
kinds of stupid things.

10:38.152 --> 10:41.505
Just use that, uh, hurt,

10:41.550 --> 10:44.028
and anger, and...

10:44.784 --> 10:48.383
Use it for things like fighting for
the school, which you're doing, so...

10:50.356 --> 10:52.119
Where do you think I learned that?

10:53.406 --> 10:54.622
From you.

10:56.798 --> 10:59.334
Listen, if you tell anyone I said this,

10:59.366 --> 11:01.424
I'll totally deny it, but...

11:02.862 --> 11:04.240
you're my hero, Callie.

11:31.939 --> 11:33.357
I know you.

11:33.682 --> 11:35.330
You came to my house that day.

11:35.344 --> 11:36.911
You and that lady cop.

11:37.686 --> 11:39.006
This is harassment.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.781
You know, now that you mention
it, I do seem to remember that.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.397
I also remember you saying

11:43.411 --> 11:45.627
that you didn't know anything
about Martha Johnson's death.

11:45.951 --> 11:47.780
But I have a picture here...

11:48.798 --> 11:50.586
that contradicts that.

11:55.154 --> 11:56.744
Should we be looking
at you as a suspect,

11:56.749 --> 11:58.073
- Mr. Harvey?
- No!

11:58.101 --> 11:59.087
No.

11:59.375 --> 12:00.916
I was at her house that day.

12:00.934 --> 12:04.429
I was painting her curb, but
I was not the only one there.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.112
Who else was there? Kyle Snow?

12:06.140 --> 12:08.809
No. Not him. Some...

12:09.918 --> 12:11.298
Someone else.

12:15.336 --> 12:16.529
Hey.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.920
Hey.

12:17.942 --> 12:20.194
Are you busy? I just,
um, thought we can...

12:20.314 --> 12:22.182
Yeah! Yeah, sure.

12:27.536 --> 12:30.222
You, uh, you okay?

12:30.342 --> 12:31.883
What happened with the...

12:31.900 --> 12:33.460
Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm...

12:33.730 --> 12:35.583
just a little anxious, that's all.

12:37.288 --> 12:39.675
Uh, what do you wanna play?

12:41.720 --> 12:45.075
How about that "Great Big
World" one that we used to do?

12:46.015 --> 12:47.102
Yeah.

12:52.153 --> 12:54.332
♪ You'll be okay ♪

12:56.230 --> 12:58.425

What page are you on?

13:27.813 --> 13:30.055
Uh, I'm on page 47.

13:30.413 --> 13:32.317
And if you ask me again in an hour,

13:32.339 --> 13:35.239
I will probably still be on page 47.

13:35.929 --> 13:37.028
Hey!

13:37.423 --> 13:41.157
So, um, there's a board
meeting tomorrow at school.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.236
They're gonna be voting on the
whole private charter thing.

13:44.901 --> 13:47.209
So a bunch of us are gonna be
there and try and save the school.

13:47.232 --> 13:48.723
Uh, you guys should...

13:49.264 --> 13:51.595
try and come. Yeah,
sure, we'll be there.

13:51.837 --> 13:53.233
Yeah, of course.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.662
Okay. Great.

14:01.421 --> 14:02.952
Is everything okay?

14:03.821 --> 14:05.660
What's going on with you g... guys?

14:05.688 --> 14:08.605
Nothing, just stupid best friend stuff.

14:11.155 --> 14:14.445
So he starts describing this guy
he saw at Johnson's house that day.

14:14.494 --> 14:16.532
Now, I'm thinking he's
talking about Troy.

14:16.567 --> 14:19.501
Her grandson; who was a suspect
but had a very tight alibi.

14:19.537 --> 14:22.345
Right. So, I show him this picture...

14:23.082 --> 14:26.055
and he says, "Yep,
that's him, absolutely."

14:26.984 --> 14:29.011
Okay, but this was four years ago.

14:29.131 --> 14:31.742
So, how do we know this guy is
remembering all this correctly,

14:31.749 --> 14:33.682
and how do we know this happened
on the day of the murder?

14:33.718 --> 14:35.999
Because thanks to a massive case of OCD,

14:36.033 --> 14:39.315
Doug Harvey is meticulous
with his bookkeeping.

14:39.355 --> 14:41.647
He has a record of every transaction
he made as a curb painter,

14:41.659 --> 14:44.120
and it proves that he was
painting Martha Johnson's curb

14:44.136 --> 14:45.921
the day she was killed,
which we verified

14:45.932 --> 14:47.013
with the canceled check from her bank.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.531
Right, which is why he's
so obsessed with the case.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.956
See, he was afraid someone
was gonna pin it on him.

14:52.076 --> 14:53.651
So what about the grandson's alibi?

14:53.691 --> 14:57.413
Okay, his alibi is his boss at
the dive shop where he works,

14:57.458 --> 14:59.165
who is now his girlfriend,

14:59.193 --> 15:01.129
and the ex-husband has confirmed with us

15:01.129 --> 15:02.863
that they were having an affair
at the time all of this went down.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.952
So you think that she's
lying to cover for him?

15:04.975 --> 15:06.185
- Yes.
- Yes.

15:08.916 --> 15:10.897
Look, this is Gray's case.

15:10.925 --> 15:12.521
You guys really need
to take this to him.

15:12.556 --> 15:15.424
He suppressed evidence in
the initial investigation.

15:15.459 --> 15:17.717
You really think he's gonna
want to open it back up?

15:19.586 --> 15:23.387
Listen, I know that you and I
have not always seen eye to eye,

15:23.734 --> 15:26.366
and of course, this is important
because this is my daughter,

15:26.417 --> 15:28.494
but if this checks out...

15:28.672 --> 15:30.605
it could mean that an innocent boy

15:30.641 --> 15:34.219
is going to a maximum
security prison for life.

15:34.275 --> 15:37.293
Why do you think Gray is so
intent on seeing Callie put away?

15:37.848 --> 15:39.675
Cause this girl, this teenage girl,

15:39.703 --> 15:42.175
keeps uncovering things
that he tried to cover up.

15:46.887 --> 15:49.112
Hey, I just need to grab some stuff.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.675
Have you ever gotten someone pregnant?

15:57.795 --> 16:00.395
No.

16:02.688 --> 16:03.772
You haven't?

16:05.776 --> 16:06.742
No.

16:08.779 --> 16:09.956
Why?

16:10.076 --> 16:12.208
S... someone at school...

16:12.528 --> 16:15.580
had a weird, top-secret Twitter account

16:15.619 --> 16:18.068
and I'm... I'm pretty sure
that it was... Mariana.

16:18.091 --> 16:21.863
I mean, it said stuff
that only she would know.

16:21.936 --> 16:24.127
Anyway, one of the posts...

16:24.380 --> 16:26.667
said that her best friend

16:26.701 --> 16:28.384
didn't tell her that she was pregnant,

16:28.399 --> 16:32.411
and Emma is Mariana's
best friend, or one of 'em.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.505
I'm not... look.

16:42.997 --> 16:46.472
What? Uh... No, no, it was...

16:46.484 --> 16:47.622
It was there, I... I know.

16:47.650 --> 16:50.218
- I... I... I saw it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey listen. It's okay.

16:51.226 --> 16:52.387
Don't worry about it.

16:54.627 --> 16:55.724
Okay.

17:07.605 --> 17:08.680
Hi!

17:08.742 --> 17:11.203
Hey Grandma, it's... it's me.

17:11.323 --> 17:14.154
Jesus! How are you, sweet boy?

17:14.672 --> 17:18.501
Uh, good, better. I'm...
I'm getting better, I think.

17:19.976 --> 17:22.351
Um, do you remember the letter...

17:22.386 --> 17:23.685
that you read me?

17:23.805 --> 17:25.116
From... from Emma?

17:25.184 --> 17:27.780
Uh, yeah, uh-huh, what about it?

17:28.760 --> 17:30.359
Did you read me all of it?

17:30.594 --> 17:34.718
Because Emma keeps asking
me if I read the whole...

17:34.932 --> 17:39.014
whole thing like... like I missed
something, something important,

17:39.048 --> 17:41.243
and I can't... I can't find it anywhere.

17:42.538 --> 17:46.091
So was there anything
that you didn't tell me?

17:50.265 --> 17:51.908
So what does this mean for Callie?

17:52.381 --> 17:55.658
Oh, it's a bit of a
Hail Mary to be honest.

17:55.778 --> 17:58.873
I'm just hoping that I can
point enough suspicion at Troy,

17:58.918 --> 18:01.125
then her actions will seem justified,

18:01.143 --> 18:03.877
so that she can turn down the plea deal,

18:04.520 --> 18:07.314
then uh, take our chances in court.

18:11.037 --> 18:13.155
Yeah? Come on in.

18:13.902 --> 18:15.255
What's up?

18:18.547 --> 18:20.127
Um...

18:21.230 --> 18:24.965
I, uh, I... I... I need
to tell you something.

18:25.663 --> 18:27.100
Okay.

18:28.366 --> 18:31.004
Emma... Emma got pregnant.

18:32.610 --> 18:34.088
- Oh?
- But then,

18:34.102 --> 18:35.982
then, she... she had an abortion.

18:37.312 --> 18:39.678
- Okay.
- I just... I just found out,

18:39.683 --> 18:41.583
and I thought that you guys should know.

18:43.218 --> 18:45.730
- Did Emma tell you?
- Not exactly.

18:45.730 --> 18:48.771
Um, she wrote me a letter, but
I couldn't read it. So, then

18:48.891 --> 18:51.428
Grandma did, and, um...

18:51.479 --> 18:53.416
So Emma doesn't know that you know.

18:58.839 --> 19:01.497
Come here, sit down.

19:03.884 --> 19:04.971
Are you, uh... ?

19:05.022 --> 19:08.564
How are you doing? How are
you feeling about all this?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.206
- It feels weird.
- Mm-hmm.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.095
I mean, obviously, Ana
could have had an abortion,

19:15.117 --> 19:16.846
and... and... and I wouldn't be here.

19:17.454 --> 19:21.447
Um... I said that I would never
get into a situation like this,

19:21.452 --> 19:24.291
but if... if I did, I wouldn't...

19:28.671 --> 19:30.585
but it's Emma's body.

19:31.746 --> 19:33.992
So...

19:35.845 --> 19:38.972
I just wish that... that
she would have told me.

19:39.866 --> 19:41.908
So are you gonna talk to her about it?

19:44.246 --> 19:45.411
I think...

19:45.592 --> 19:47.117
I think... I think I should wait

19:47.151 --> 19:48.915
until she brings it up.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.342
So you're in a relationship
with Troy, right?

20:49.553 --> 20:51.709
I was. We broke up.

20:51.829 --> 20:53.674
Hmm, sorry to hear that.

20:53.956 --> 20:55.955
- You were together how long?
- A few years.

20:55.978 --> 20:57.323
Can you be more specific?

20:57.374 --> 20:59.204
Because according to your ex-husband,

20:59.226 --> 21:02.022
you and Troy started having
an affair about five years ago.

21:02.057 --> 21:03.371
Is that correct?

21:03.491 --> 21:05.825
I'm gonna need you to
answer me "yes" or "no."

21:07.514 --> 21:09.544
- Yes.
- So is that why you lied?

21:09.561 --> 21:11.599
- I didn't.
- But you do know

21:11.600 --> 21:14.234
that falsifying evidence
is a felony, right?

21:14.354 --> 21:17.899
And if we end up proving
that you lied, you go to jail.

21:19.527 --> 21:23.076
So I want you to think very
carefully before you answer this.

21:24.993 --> 21:28.348
Do you swear that Troy
Johnson was at work that day

21:28.383 --> 21:30.984
as you stated to the police at the time?

21:31.019 --> 21:33.342
Come on, come on, come
on, come on. Come on.

21:35.290 --> 21:37.117
- Yes.
- Damn it!

21:38.193 --> 21:39.258
Okay.

21:40.544 --> 21:41.769
I'll be back.

21:47.728 --> 21:49.628
- She's lying.
- Maybe.

21:50.332 --> 21:52.067
But I don't think we're
gonna get anywhere here.

21:52.187 --> 21:53.873
Can't we at least bring Troy in?

21:53.993 --> 21:55.355
Harvey placed him at the scene.

21:55.377 --> 21:56.990
That's plenty of
grounds to question him.

21:57.765 --> 21:58.978
What's going on?

21:59.014 --> 22:00.162
We cloned Diamond's phone.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.972
Looks like her pimp
is coming to get her.

22:02.092 --> 22:03.134
"Bring Tina."

22:03.161 --> 22:04.284
Tina, what?

22:04.319 --> 22:05.656
Your pimp's running crystal meth?

22:05.674 --> 22:08.070
Yeah, he jacked it off a street dealer.

22:08.098 --> 22:10.583
I just don't understand why he
gave it to Diamond to hold on to.

22:10.601 --> 22:11.844
I, uh, I have got to go.

22:11.876 --> 22:14.493
Go, go, go. We'll...
we'll figure something out.

22:14.799 --> 22:16.642
- And thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:22.953 --> 22:24.760
- Good turnout, huh?
- Yeah!

22:24.818 --> 22:27.795
Yeah, it's a good thing that
somebody tweeted the rumor, you know?

22:28.079 --> 22:29.497
Yeah, I know, right.

22:31.263 --> 22:33.246
Look, I... I know it was you.

22:34.705 --> 22:35.732
What?

22:35.852 --> 22:38.804
The... the... the...
the Twitter account.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.268
No... no Secrets, or whatever?

22:40.288 --> 22:41.925
I... I know that it was you.

22:41.988 --> 22:43.223
Look, I'm not stupid,

22:43.858 --> 22:46.008
Mariana. In fact, you're the stupid one

22:46.011 --> 22:48.335
for thinking that no one
was gonna figure it out.

22:48.502 --> 22:50.723
I cannot believe that
you knew about Emma,

22:50.741 --> 22:51.871
and you... you didn't tell me.

22:51.898 --> 22:54.283
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry, Jesus!

22:54.403 --> 22:55.632
You have a freaking TBI.

22:55.645 --> 22:57.919
Y... y... you flipped out when
there was a pepperoni on your pizza.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.504
So excuse me for not telling you
that your girlfriend was pregnant.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.405
And for the record, I didn't
know until a little while ago.

23:05.414 --> 23:06.661
She didn't tell me.

23:06.781 --> 23:09.015
So if you want to be mad at
anyone, be mad at Brandon.

23:09.693 --> 23:11.910
Why would I be mad at Brandon?

23:12.725 --> 23:14.936
Just waiting for the last black
and whites to get into place.

23:14.955 --> 23:16.585
Once Russell picks up
Diamond and the drugs...

23:16.705 --> 23:18.800
we'll force him this
way, and he'll be trapped.

23:19.606 --> 23:22.107
I'm just glad we're finally
gonna get this scumbag locked up.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.251
Nice work, Foster.

23:25.934 --> 23:27.333
I knew you were gonna be good at this.

23:27.369 --> 23:30.103
Yeah, Adams-Foster. Trust me, you
don't want to piss off my wife.

23:35.973 --> 23:38.595
Come on, Russell, where are you?

23:55.110 --> 23:56.329
Excuse me, guys, thank you.

23:58.052 --> 23:59.232
Over here.

24:01.269 --> 24:02.377
C... can we come in yet?

24:02.390 --> 24:03.575
Isn't the meeting about to start?

24:03.642 --> 24:05.530
Um, yes, we are about to start,

24:05.535 --> 24:07.346
but it's a closed meeting.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.791
We were told we could attend,
that's why we're all here.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.111
Well, I'm sorry, you were misinformed.

24:12.147 --> 24:13.112
Whew!

24:14.610 --> 24:16.152
Why are you doing this?!

24:18.193 --> 24:20.111
Nick doesn't even go
to school here anymore.

24:20.161 --> 24:21.494
Whose fault is that?

24:22.571 --> 24:25.140
You know everything that happened
with Nick is because of you.

24:25.305 --> 24:26.913
You're the reason, he...

24:26.936 --> 24:29.206
he stalked me, and he
broke into my house.

24:29.231 --> 24:31.634
You're the reason he could have
hurt everyone in this school!

24:32.823 --> 24:34.932
And you're the reason
he almost killed himself.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.423
He never had a chance
with a father like you.

24:39.729 --> 24:43.009
Hasn't your family done
enough damage to Anchor Beach?

24:44.784 --> 24:46.635
I'm not gonna let you take my school.

24:47.577 --> 24:48.915
Thing is...

24:49.550 --> 24:51.104
you don't have a say.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.207
What's happening?

25:18.605 --> 25:20.883
What the hell are you doing?
We're setting up a bust here.

25:20.901 --> 25:23.429
- We got a 911 from this address.
- Oh my God!

25:25.625 --> 25:26.801
Diamond?

25:26.875 --> 25:27.922
Diamond!

25:27.956 --> 25:29.188
Diamond.

25:33.161 --> 25:34.244
Hello?!

25:34.364 --> 25:36.457
Don't panic, okay?
We've dispatched officers

25:36.474 --> 25:38.478
who should be arriving at any minute.

25:38.534 --> 25:40.269
This is Officer Adams-Foster.

25:40.292 --> 25:42.335
We're all clear here,
Operator, thank you.

25:42.370 --> 25:43.642
Yes, Officer.

25:46.102 --> 25:47.589
Where is Diamond?

25:47.865 --> 25:49.275
What's goin' on?

25:49.311 --> 25:50.827
- Where's Diamond?
- They gone.

25:50.860 --> 25:53.674
- They who?
- Diamond and Christina.

25:53.888 --> 25:55.352
Christina? Tina!

25:55.385 --> 25:56.647
Christina. "Bring Tina."

25:56.917 --> 25:58.601
I'm so stupid.

25:58.721 --> 26:00.522
She's bringing him a girl.

26:03.995 --> 26:05.583
Any word on the trial?

26:06.259 --> 26:08.083
Yeah, they offered me a deal.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.602
So, probation. That's great, right?

26:11.033 --> 26:12.604
Yeah, not this one.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.137
It's, um, three years in jail.

26:15.887 --> 26:18.662
Three years? For what?
That's ridiculous.

26:19.014 --> 26:20.793
Yeah, but I'm gonna take it.

26:23.258 --> 26:24.816
What the... ? Pull over.

26:27.068 --> 26:28.937
I don't believe these two.

26:31.625 --> 26:33.458
Hey! Hey, hey.

26:33.494 --> 26:35.694
Stop right there! What
do you think you're doing?

26:35.814 --> 26:36.985
Cause it looks like you're running away,

26:36.999 --> 26:38.332
and I know y'all are not that dumb!

26:38.332 --> 26:40.665
Guys, don't do this. I thought
you were trying to clean up.

26:40.692 --> 26:42.701
You know my mom took a really
big chance getting you into GU.

26:42.736 --> 26:44.333
He's gonna kill me.

26:44.495 --> 26:46.973
If I don't go back to
Russell, he's gonna kill me.

26:47.004 --> 26:48.937
He ghosted the last
girl who crossed him,

26:48.982 --> 26:52.420
and if I wanna... if I
wanna get out of this alive,

26:52.613 --> 26:55.581
I gotta go back to him, and
I gotta bring him a girl.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.416
I don't... I don't wanna go anymore.

26:57.451 --> 26:58.766
What? No, no, you have to!

26:58.775 --> 27:00.612
You said you would. You promised!

27:00.693 --> 27:02.216
But you said he was gonna
get me a record deal.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.129
No, he will! He knows folks,
he knows people, I swear.

27:05.152 --> 27:06.462
She's lying to you, Christina.

27:06.494 --> 27:07.800
- No, I'm not, just...
- Yes, you are.

27:07.836 --> 27:09.711
Just... just come. Just come with me,

27:09.730 --> 27:11.449
and you just... you just
got to come meet him,

27:11.490 --> 27:14.021
and if you don't like him,
you... you can leave, I swear.

27:14.048 --> 27:15.223
Now you really are lying!

27:15.236 --> 27:16.700
No! Stop! Just...

27:16.984 --> 27:19.777
Please! You just... you
gotta come. Just come.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.439
He's coming now. He's...
he's coming to come get us.

27:22.509 --> 27:23.606
I can't.

27:23.660 --> 27:26.146
- You don't have to, you don't have to.
- You stay out of this!

27:26.182 --> 27:27.412
It doesn't concern you!

27:27.448 --> 27:29.330
- I'll go.
- What?!

27:29.450 --> 27:30.363
Yeah.

27:30.543 --> 27:32.384
- What?!
- Like hell you will.

27:32.419 --> 27:33.418
Oh, please!

27:33.637 --> 27:35.254
I don't have anything to lose.

27:35.289 --> 27:37.015
I mean, I am going to
jail tomorrow, so...

27:38.001 --> 27:39.128
Callie.

27:39.627 --> 27:41.907
Okay folks, let's get started.

27:44.632 --> 27:46.267
Wait a second. Where are the...

27:46.387 --> 27:47.966
You said that this would
be the open meeting.

27:48.002 --> 27:50.956
The board decided they'd prefer to
have this conversation privately.

27:51.028 --> 27:53.663
- But you specifically told me...
- It's the board's right, Lena.

27:58.928 --> 28:01.095
Thank you all for being here

28:01.121 --> 28:03.097
on this very important night

28:03.098 --> 28:05.796
to talk about the
future of Anchor Beach.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.548
Now, let me bring up the
man who has a real vision

28:09.566 --> 28:12.165
for how to ensure the future of ABCC.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.575
Craig Stratos.

28:20.036 --> 28:21.585
Anchor Beach...

28:21.887 --> 28:25.081
has the potential to be a
world-class secondary school,

28:25.113 --> 28:27.815
but it's under-funded,
and over-extended.

28:28.509 --> 28:30.383
I am willing to raise...

28:30.503 --> 28:31.721
and donate...

28:31.788 --> 28:34.828
the money needed to
make ABCC an elite...

28:34.948 --> 28:37.032
first-rate private school,

28:37.595 --> 28:40.842
the likes of which San
Diego has never seen.

28:41.274 --> 28:42.869
So, you want to remind us where you were

28:42.883 --> 28:44.491
on the day of Martha Johnson's murder?

28:44.982 --> 28:47.945
I'm not saying anything
until my lawyer shows up.

28:48.065 --> 28:50.561
Okay, that's fine,
that's... that's your right.

28:51.365 --> 28:53.943
Uh, so just listen.

28:55.302 --> 28:57.471
Look, you're guilty, we all know it.

28:57.863 --> 29:00.029
Your DNA's on the murder weapon.

29:00.335 --> 29:02.420
And I know... I know
what you're gonna say.

29:02.898 --> 29:05.610
"It was a garden axe. I was helping
my grandmother in the garden."

29:06.073 --> 29:07.546
Which would be fine...

29:07.790 --> 29:09.501
except you gave sworn testimony

29:09.516 --> 29:11.316
that you were at work
the day she was killed.

29:11.436 --> 29:13.645
Now, we have a witness who was painting

29:13.654 --> 29:15.202
your grandmother's curb that day,

29:15.218 --> 29:16.403
and can prove it.

29:16.997 --> 29:19.164
Who places you at the scene.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.655
No, I... that's not...

29:22.363 --> 29:24.489
I... I have a witness too,

29:24.556 --> 29:26.859
who testified that I
was at work that day.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.093
Oh, you mean Vanessa?

29:29.615 --> 29:30.940
Yeah, we brought her in.

29:30.989 --> 29:33.142
Told her about our friend,
the curb painter, and...

29:33.480 --> 29:35.021
seems like ever since you two broke up,

29:35.034 --> 29:37.354
she's much less interested
in protecting you.

29:37.578 --> 29:39.480
Seems like all we had to do was tell her

29:39.513 --> 29:42.146
that falsifying evidence
was a felony, and well...

29:44.740 --> 29:45.857
So...

29:47.614 --> 29:49.713
Well, here's the deal, Troy.

29:50.424 --> 29:52.714
You can draw this out and
make this hard on yourself,

29:53.412 --> 29:57.646
or... this can be over now.

29:58.956 --> 30:02.059
Now, you got to be tired carrying
this around you all this time.

30:06.419 --> 30:07.672
Admit it now,

30:07.942 --> 30:10.478
and we'll make sure you
don't end up on Death Row.

30:24.391 --> 30:26.608
I was over helping her with yard work.

30:29.865 --> 30:31.194
I used to do that...

30:32.414 --> 30:33.766
sometimes.

30:36.157 --> 30:38.904
She told me that she
took me out of her will,

30:38.931 --> 30:40.512
'cause she was...

30:41.229 --> 30:44.476
tired of me asking
for money all the time.

30:45.887 --> 30:49.140
She thought that I needed
to stand on my own two feet.

30:55.081 --> 30:56.388
I was...

30:58.325 --> 31:01.693
I was just so mad that she could
even say something like that.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.132
I had the axe in my hands.

31:13.776 --> 31:16.475
And she was turning to
walk away from me, and I...

31:21.165 --> 31:23.196
I just swung and hit her.

31:26.863 --> 31:28.463
I didn't mean it.

31:33.594 --> 31:35.718
I didn't think that I
would actually hit her.

31:42.536 --> 31:44.160
But you did.

31:45.142 --> 31:46.241
Right?

31:59.060 --> 32:00.078
Get in.

32:15.276 --> 32:16.272
Hello?

32:16.392 --> 32:17.727
He confessed.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.766
- What? Who did?
- Troy Johnson.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.999
Oh my God. Are you serious?

32:26.039 --> 32:27.652
Yep, to the whole thing.

32:27.772 --> 32:30.561
DA's gonna have a hard time denying
Callie was afraid of him now.

32:30.583 --> 32:33.107
- I think you got yourself a dismissal.
- Okay.

32:35.139 --> 32:37.598
Oh my God, thank you,
Mike. Thank you so much!

32:37.640 --> 32:39.864
I'm... I... I'm gonna call Callie.

32:39.900 --> 32:41.468
Okay.

32:41.588 --> 32:42.934
Okay.

32:42.969 --> 32:44.481
Oh, Callie.

32:45.332 --> 32:46.771
My God.

32:46.806 --> 32:48.958
- Hey!
- Where's Callie?

32:49.025 --> 32:51.743
She's with, um, Diamond,
and that Russell guy.

32:51.778 --> 32:54.746
She said you should, you know,
track her phone and find them.

32:54.866 --> 32:56.722
Oh my God, Callie.

33:05.992 --> 33:07.667
He's gonna pat us down.

33:07.894 --> 33:09.441
Best hide your phone.

33:32.458 --> 33:36.570
Wow. Anchor Beach Academy
sounds like an amazing place.

33:36.907 --> 33:40.510
An elite learning
institution for the elite.

33:41.388 --> 33:44.811
I was a founding member of
the Anchor Beach charter.

33:45.593 --> 33:48.004
It was created because a group of us

33:48.060 --> 33:50.960
wanted our children, and the
children of this community

33:50.988 --> 33:54.034
to have access to a quality education.

33:54.741 --> 33:58.977
So why would we go back on that promise?

33:59.164 --> 34:01.118
And make it only
available to those families

34:01.157 --> 34:03.910
who can afford $30,000 a year.

34:05.206 --> 34:08.768
A good education is not a privilege.

34:08.888 --> 34:10.301
It's a right.

34:11.427 --> 34:14.130
We cannot continue to
take away from the poor...

34:14.473 --> 34:16.139
to give to the wealthy.

34:17.469 --> 34:21.253
No new auditorium, or
improved computer lab...

34:21.668 --> 34:24.635
is worth betraying
these kids that we serve.

34:25.194 --> 34:28.196
These kids that you know and love.

34:29.641 --> 34:31.534
So please, please...

34:32.137 --> 34:35.803
don't throw away all the
good work we're doing here.

34:37.429 --> 34:39.693
It would be a terrible,
terrible mistake.

34:40.853 --> 34:42.047
Thank you.

34:43.370 --> 34:45.301
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

34:45.318 --> 34:47.998
- They won't let us into the meeting.
- You're kidding.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.562
Hey, so I... I... I think, uh...

34:51.764 --> 34:54.271
Jesus is starting to get suspicious.

34:54.445 --> 34:55.900
Are you sure? Wait!

34:55.935 --> 34:58.060
I was just with him a little
while ago, he didn't say anything.

34:58.105 --> 35:00.611
- No, I'm... I'm sure.
- Did you?

35:01.007 --> 35:03.007
Hey, did you know about Emma?

35:03.043 --> 35:04.542
What... what about?

35:04.577 --> 35:07.281
- That she was pregnant!
- Shh! Quiet, Jesus!

35:07.295 --> 35:09.336
Come here, come on, stop! Stop!

35:09.456 --> 35:11.916
Why did you know?! Why didn't
you... why would you tell him?

35:11.951 --> 35:14.055
- I didn't! He...
- I... I figured it out.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.287
- And...
- And... and... and what, Brandon?!

35:16.308 --> 35:18.950
- And... and I went with her to...
- What...

35:18.992 --> 35:20.674
Wait, wait, you...

35:20.717 --> 35:24.068
You took Emma to... to
get an... an abortion?!

35:24.082 --> 35:26.388
Stop, Jesus, stop,
okay?! She was scared,

35:26.390 --> 35:28.255
she needed a friend, and
she couldn't tell you.

35:28.284 --> 35:30.106
Why couldn't she tell me?!
Why couldn't you tell me?!

35:30.162 --> 35:33.104
I mean, everyone else knew!
My whole freaking family knew!

35:33.146 --> 35:35.581
Emma, why couldn't you...
why couldn't you tell me?

35:35.608 --> 35:38.629
I'm sorry, Jesus. I really am, I just...

35:38.833 --> 35:40.938
I thought that it was for the best.

35:41.648 --> 35:44.105
Because... because the baby was his.

35:44.471 --> 35:46.047
That's why you didn't want to tell me.

35:46.089 --> 35:47.758
Because the baby was Brandon's.

35:47.774 --> 35:48.996
- Jesus, that...
- Guys, come here!

35:49.013 --> 35:51.000
They're not gonna let us in,
so we're not gonna let them out!

35:51.023 --> 35:52.149
- No, hey, hey!
- Jesus!

35:52.194 --> 35:53.825
Wait, let me, let me.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.037
Jesus!

36:11.678 --> 36:13.346
You know where his has to go.

36:17.617 --> 36:20.424
My God, my phone! My
mom's gonna track my phone.

36:21.905 --> 36:26.452
- Should we run?
- He has a gun. A gun!

36:36.129 --> 36:37.107
Well...

36:37.227 --> 36:40.894
the motion to dissolve the
Anchor Beach charter is carried.

36:46.531 --> 36:49.979
What's going on?

36:53.724 --> 36:55.272
Education is a right!

36:55.300 --> 36:57.735
Not just for the rich and white!

36:57.777 --> 36:59.628
Education is a right!

36:59.671 --> 37:01.606
Not just for the rich and white!

37:01.648 --> 37:03.372
Education is a right!

37:03.393 --> 37:05.463
Not just for the rich and white!

37:05.470 --> 37:07.236
Education is a right!

37:07.271 --> 37:09.277
Not just for the rich and white!

37:09.397 --> 37:11.022
Education is a right!

37:11.022 --> 37:12.958
Not just for the rich and white!

37:12.987 --> 37:14.817
Education is a right!

37:14.845 --> 37:16.675
Good luck explaining to
them what you've done.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.753
You call the cops on me, bitch?!

37:51.778 --> 37:53.233
You damn near got me arrested.

37:53.284 --> 37:55.639
- I ought to knock your ugly head off.
- I'm sorry.

37:55.759 --> 37:58.138
I didn't know, I just...

37:58.363 --> 38:01.015
They... they knew you was
coming to get me, and...

38:01.135 --> 38:03.955
and they was setting up a sting, and...

38:03.990 --> 38:06.607
I called 911 to let you know!

38:06.626 --> 38:08.763
They knew? How the hell did they know?

38:08.808 --> 38:10.069
- What? You tell 'em?
- No!

38:10.114 --> 38:12.023
You're so stupid, you probably
told them something, huh?

38:12.073 --> 38:13.564
I swear I didn't say nothing!

38:13.600 --> 38:14.966
You better not have.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.867
I find out you've been
talking to the cops?

38:16.903 --> 38:19.714
- I'll kill you, you understand?
- Yeah.

38:24.586 --> 38:25.810
Is this her?

38:28.715 --> 38:30.233
This is Christina.

38:36.326 --> 38:37.622
Not bad.

38:38.297 --> 38:40.020
Thought you said she was 14.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.144
