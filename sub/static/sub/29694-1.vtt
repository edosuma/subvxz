01:42.477 --> 01:44.897
This is a Neanderthal.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.903
He looks pretty nice doesn't he?

01:48.901 --> 01:50.301
But he's stupid.

01:51.737 --> 01:57.327
He's a stupid savage,
growling and barbaric. A cave man.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.993
As the conventional knowledge claims.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.334
Are members of it today
Sigma Kai in our room?

02:02.372 --> 02:04.172
Yes man.

02:05.209 --> 02:08.276
How do you feel as a Kappa Alpha Theta
members you call cavemen?

02:09.838 --> 02:11.261
That's an insult, isn't it?

02:12.966 --> 02:17.386
But let's go back to our Neanderthal friends.
Evolved from our common ancestors,

02:17.429 --> 02:19.139
"EVOLUTION OF NEANDERTHALERS"
- three to four hundred thousand years ago.

02:19.181 --> 02:23.021
We know they were stocky.
Strong people with a very strong construction.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.555
"NEANDERTHALERS VS HOMO SAPIENS"
- Physically exactly a caveman.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.939
What happened to them?

02:28.982 --> 02:33.492
The modern human with our superior
intelligence has competed them away

02:33.529 --> 02:38.159
and driven them to extinction.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.199
This makes perfect sense, doesn't it?

02:43.330 --> 02:46.250
I say that this is completely incorrect.

02:47.960 --> 02:53.050
Fossil remains were discovered in 1856
for the first time from a human-like being ...

02:53.090 --> 02:55.180
"NEANDER DAL"
- in the Neandertal in Germany.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.087
Hence the name Neanderthal.

02:57.135 --> 03:01.845
That was in the Darwin era. It was
also the Sir Francis Galton era.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.600
Galton was an exceptional one
man, a genius.

03:05.644 --> 03:09.114
His greatest contribution to future
generations is the Eugenics.

03:09.147 --> 03:13.687
He and his followers thought
that based on one's appearance ...

03:13.735 --> 03:17.025
his level of intelligence or civilization
could be determined.

03:19.658 --> 03:23.347
I wonder if you can guess which breed
Galton thought it was the most intelligent

03:25.622 --> 03:29.212
It turns out that Sir Francis
was very biased,

03:29.251 --> 03:31.291
which blinded him for the evidence.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.925
He was a white European man,

03:32.963 --> 03:37.433
so he stated that white Europeans do it
the pinnacle of human development.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.137
Actually ... they are not.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.694
Okay, listen to this.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.977
Genetic studies show
that everyone outside of Sub-Saharan Africa

03:51.023 --> 03:53.533
between 1 and 4 percent

03:53.567 --> 03:55.187
Neanderthal genes.

03:55.861 --> 04:00.371
Yes, people, that means
what you think it means. Yes.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.777
Do you now feel better about yourself,
Sigma Kai?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.226
Yes.

04:04.536 --> 04:09.996
Could it be that we are dying out the Neanderthal
have not caused with our superior functions ...

04:10.042 --> 04:13.092
but that we might have those traits
have taken over from them?

04:14.087 --> 04:17.627
That's an interesting question,
but we will never know the answer.

04:18.216 --> 04:22.007
Unless we are a Neanderthal
meet in person.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.471
But that is impossible ...

04:26.016 --> 04:27.416
Or not?

04:27.726 --> 04:33.566
Coincidentally, the world's only non-fossilized ones
remains of a Neanderthal

04:33.607 --> 04:36.817
present here on this campus,
across the square.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.569
These were discovered by my boss,
Dr. Godwin Thomas.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.235
Dr. Thomas called him William,

04:42.282 --> 04:44.992
to William King, the Irish
Natural scientist,

04:45.035 --> 04:48.547
the first scientist to be Neanderthals
recognized as a separate species.

04:49.122 --> 04:55.462
We learned a lot from William, but we
have not yet exploited its real potential.

04:56.213 --> 04:59.513
It wouldn't be great
if anyone can find a way

04:59.550 --> 05:05.760
to use his DNA to make a
clone living Neanderthal?

05:08.267 --> 05:09.667
Is that a crazy idea?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.212
Probably.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.524
But don't you want to meet your cousin William?

05:16.567 --> 05:18.437
- Yes.
- Yes.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.094
Me too.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.305
All right, that's it for today.

05:22.531 --> 05:25.451
Read chapters three and four
from the book of Rodgers and Jacobs

05:25.492 --> 05:27.581
and I see you all
next Thursday.

05:44.219 --> 05:47.349
I know how to do it.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.311
- How should you do that?
- How to clone a Neanderthal.

05:53.729 --> 05:59.439
Really? And where does a student go
like you gained that experience?

05:59.484 --> 06:02.994
I'm not actually a student.
I'm a doctor.

06:03.447 --> 06:07.737
I have a PhD in reproductive
endocrinology and bio-engineering.

06:12.124 --> 06:15.504
Oh ... um ... Do you want a glass of wine?

06:15.959 --> 06:17.379
"Provisional sequence Neanderthal Genome"
- Well, the basic procedure ...

06:17.419 --> 06:19.089
is one-on-one cloning.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.509
We start with it
to remove cell nuclear DNA

06:21.548 --> 06:23.298
from the receiving Gay
sapiens donor egg cell,

06:23.342 --> 06:26.432
and then we replace it with DNA
taken from William's monster.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.557
But that is not nearly enough.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.015
- Including mitochondria?
- Yes. Otherwise it will be a messy event,

06:28.597 --> 06:34.937
Are you telling me that you should
copy the entire protein profile?

06:35.062 --> 06:39.612
what can be acceptable to sheep,
but certainly not for the human species.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.860
That seems to be a difficult job.

06:43.987 --> 06:48.237
Yes, but I said it would be possible.
Not easy, or cheap.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.278
Well then we can get started better.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.043
- What?
- You know you're crazy?

06:59.378 --> 07:01.458
I know, I know.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.545
What's the meaning of this?
Why Neanderthals?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.469
What does that yield?

07:14.351 --> 07:15.751
I want to show you something.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.879
Here we are.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.277
Batman's cave. Yes, baby.

07:27.114 --> 07:31.454
This is my kingdom.
It happens here.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.021
Come on.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.599
- Can I touch this?
- Yes go ahead.

08:03.817 --> 08:09.157
One of these is made by Homo sapiens,
the other by Neanderthals.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.658
- No.
- Which is what?

08:11.408 --> 08:13.828
- Yes.
- Wow.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.522
This is amazing.

08:19.166 --> 08:24.496
Well, imagine how much you can learn

08:24.546 --> 08:28.376
by our most related cousin
to bring it back to life.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.008
No, our equal.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.852
He alone can tell us
who we are and who we are not.

08:35.265 --> 08:40.684
This is the ontology part of paleontology.
The study of existence and becoming.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.060
I think...

08:58.205 --> 09:01.965
I think we need him
to better understand ourselves.

09:06.505 --> 09:09.265
You are a very interesting one
person, dr. Reid.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.718
And you too, Dr. Sullivan.

09:18.475 --> 09:22.515
- Yes.
- Godwin? With Bob Clayborn.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.232
Good evening, Bob.

09:25.524 --> 09:30.404
Godwin, I'm struggling with a difficult problem,
and I would like to know your opinion.

09:30.445 --> 09:34.565
- Okay, how can I help you?
- Of course I am talking about the Neanderthal project

09:34.616 --> 09:39.946
Bob. I really don't think so
I am the one who must give his opinion.

09:39.997 --> 09:43.247
I'm not asking you for anything negative
to say about your colleagues.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.089
I only need your vision.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.980
How? What can I say?

09:48.046 --> 09:51.876
Barbara and Julian
are an academic super couple.

09:52.217 --> 09:56.757
Three groundbreaking articles in two
year time. Their work is amazing.

09:57.014 --> 10:00.348
Well, I could lose them if
faculty members when I stop the project.

10:00.559 --> 10:03.139
But that is not my biggest concern.
I have a dilemma.

10:03.187 --> 10:09.477
I have to decide if I have them
whether or not it will give green light

10:09.735 --> 10:11.135
to take the final step.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.355
Have you submitted this to Rich Rowley?

10:14.406 --> 10:17.656
As a bioethics specialist, I think
this idea horrible.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.621
He called it a fairground attraction.

10:19.661 --> 10:24.961
- What about Nida Burang?
- She wants to continue the project.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.309
She is convinced that the investigation
will have great benefits.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.879
Please, Godwin, I ...

10:32.299 --> 10:37.679
I'll call you as my friend.
I can no longer postpone the decision.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.768
How shall I formulate it?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.442
I admit that I have my doubts

10:44.478 --> 10:49.068
at Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein character of this project.

10:50.234 --> 10:52.324
Great doubts.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.346
I understand your point.

10:57.407 --> 11:01.657
Okay, thank you, Godwin, for your sincerity.
Good night.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.858
Let's finish the project anyway.

11:28.564 --> 11:29.964
Are you serious?

11:33.569 --> 11:37.359
- Who will carry the fetus?
- I'm going to do that.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.579
- Wow.
- Let's have a child.

11:57.259 --> 12:00.889
"Welcome to Nevada
The Silver State "

12:00.929 --> 12:06.139
Barbara, never promise
To kick Julian's 'Blue Suede Shoes' ...

12:06.185 --> 12:09.855
- and always too 'Love Him Tender'?
- I promise.

12:10.397 --> 12:14.817
And you, Julian, never promise Barbara
leaving the 'Heartbreak Hotel' ...

12:14.860 --> 12:19.910
- and always be her 'Burning Love'?
- I promise.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.367
Then I declare you now
to husband and wife.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.568
You better kiss the bride now,
young man.

12:29.041 --> 12:32.381
You are doing great.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.710
- Sorry ...
- The baby is coming.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.175
I want you to squeeze very hard
at the next woe.

12:37.216 --> 12:38.716
- Okay?
- Keep breathing, ready?

12:38.759 --> 12:40.889
- Yes.
- Pressing, pressing.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.164
That's how he goes.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.227
To breathe. To breathe.
No, no, press, press, press.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.272
It worked well done.

12:56.318 --> 12:57.880
What is it?

12:58.028 --> 13:00.818
It is a boy.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.369
Congratulations, mother and father.

13:10.082 --> 13:12.582
- He's healthy.
- (What the hell is that?)

13:12.626 --> 13:14.206
You did a great job.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.295
- Is everything alright?
- Yes.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.740
Yes?

13:27.349 --> 13:28.749
Here he is.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.944
He is beautiful.

13:34.064 --> 13:36.114
It is a well-built boy.

14:10.559 --> 14:14.269
- Julian?
- Barbara Sullivan and I have a child.

14:14.313 --> 14:18.073
A healthy boy from
nine pounds and seven ounces.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.494
Congratulations.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.408
Bob, I'm really sorry I am you
put in this situation.

14:27.201 --> 14:30.224
There will be tomorrow morning at ten o'clock
be held at a press conference.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.230
This explains it all.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.053
I gave him a clear assignment
to stop the project,

14:45.093 --> 14:47.553
but he used instead
university funds to continue it.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.176
We need that bastard
dismiss and sue.

14:50.224 --> 14:52.814
If we sue him,
he just takes his Neanderthal with him

14:52.851 --> 14:55.021
to one of the dozens
universities with a lot of money,

14:55.062 --> 14:56.522
who will gladly hire him.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.193
You would think it's cloning
of people is against the law.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.693
- Well, not in Nevada.
- Nevada.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.870
The university does not own
the DNA this thing is made of?

15:06.907 --> 15:08.317
This makes it our property, right?

15:08.367 --> 15:10.945
Well, the 13th amendment to the constitution
suggests the opposite.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.699
And what is the 13th amendment?

15:12.746 --> 15:15.456
- That which forbids slavery.
- Right.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.581
And he's not a thing, George.

15:17.626 --> 15:21.166
- What about our liability?
- We are fully responsible.

15:21.213 --> 15:24.303
Serious.
What if he grows up and becomes violent?

15:24.550 --> 15:26.680
Resources from the university
used to create it.

15:26.718 --> 15:30.598
So whether he stays here or not, we wear
the responsibility for what happens.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.039
Jesus.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.346
- If you allow me, Bob.
- Hmmm.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.608
This will be worldwide news tomorrow morning.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.769
If we work out and sue Reid,

15:40.816 --> 15:43.610
we bear full responsibility,
but without the benefits.

15:43.735 --> 15:48.985
On the other hand, if we embrace it, we get the
publicity and the ability to control it.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.537
So what do you think Bob?

16:03.755 --> 16:08.545
This is William, a healthy one
Neanderthal baby one week old.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.306
Fertilized and reproduced using
transfer of a somatic cell nucleus

16:12.347 --> 16:13.767
with Neanderthal DNA.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.191
This scientific breakthrough was possible,
because unlike ordinary fossils

16:17.227 --> 16:20.017
William's tissue samples
have been preserved,

16:20.063 --> 16:23.023
including intact sets
of the DNA in the cell nucleus.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.648
Dr. Barbara Sullivan
that you see here with William,

16:25.694 --> 16:28.363
has used a lot of groundbreaking
developed.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.755
She also carried the fetus
until the moment of birth.

16:31.033 --> 16:34.373
- Dr. Reid, so he's a clone.
- In fact, yes.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.911
Professor, don't most clones die?

16:36.955 --> 16:38.615
So far, yes.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.625
But we have new replacement methods
developed for the DNA of the mitochondria

16:42.669 --> 16:45.009
next to the DNA of the cell nucleus.
- What does that mean?

16:45.047 --> 16:48.377
- That means he's fine.
- What about diseases?

16:48.425 --> 16:53.045
We have indicators that indicate that
William's immune system will be very strong,

16:53.096 --> 16:57.476
but we take all possible precautions.
That's why you see photos instead of actually seeing them.

16:57.518 --> 16:59.228
What about the moral aspect?

17:01.188 --> 17:04.858
Explain to me how this is
is immoral in any way.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.401
Are you a proud father, Dr. Reid?

17:07.444 --> 17:10.454
I have to state clearly
that there is no genetic link

17:10.489 --> 17:12.819
of any kind between William
and myself or Dr. Sullivan.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.866
But I am very proud.

17:16.744 --> 17:20.165
Yes, really proud.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.957
There are many people
I have to thank.

17:24.377 --> 17:30.008
First, my esteemed colleague, my dear
girlfriend and my wife, Dr. Barbara Sullivan.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.345
And also my boss,
Dr. Godwin Thomas.

17:33.387 --> 17:34.847
Her brilliant fieldwork yielded

17:34.888 --> 17:38.598
the Neanderthal monster,
from which the DNA was extracted.

17:38.642 --> 17:42.692
And Wallace University
President, Bob Clayborn.

17:42.729 --> 17:47.979
He was a constant source of support
for this historical project.

17:48.443 --> 17:49.843
Thank you, Bob.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.534
Congratulations Bob,
we have become famous.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.911
Let me make something clear, Julian.

17:59.246 --> 18:03.286
This project is supervised by
a committee led by Godwin.

18:03.667 --> 18:07.047
You are not allowed to do anything
without her and my permission.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.447
I understand that.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.773
- Julian. Julian.
- Hey.

18:17.431 --> 18:19.101
Congratulations.

18:20.267 --> 18:24.517
Congratulations to Barbara and to William.

18:25.397 --> 18:26.797
Thank you, Godwin.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.466
Thanks.

18:30.903 --> 18:33.453
- I'll be there if you need me.
- Thanks.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.423
He said...

19:27.668 --> 19:29.313
that the key is under the doormat.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.508
You can come home
anytime you want.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.056
- I love you.
- I love you too.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.114
Dad?

21:45.848 --> 21:48.728
- Hello, William.
- Hey.

21:50.227 --> 21:51.627
I'm Sara.

21:52.813 --> 21:54.213
Nice to meet you.

21:55.065 --> 21:57.815
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

22:00.946 --> 22:02.356
Julian is at a staff meeting.

22:02.406 --> 22:04.946
But he would eat for it
to be at home.

22:06.660 --> 22:09.410
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

22:17.671 --> 22:19.211
- Shall I clean this up?
- I'll wear them.

22:19.256 --> 22:21.546
Thanks.

22:22.718 --> 22:25.008
This ... thanks.

22:38.108 --> 22:41.898
Ooh. I see you one
have a healthy appetite, William.

22:44.865 --> 22:48.955
His body weight and metabolism
require 20% more calories than with us.

22:48.994 --> 22:50.584
And a higher protein content.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.756
- The chicken is delicious.
- Thanks.

23:19.483 --> 23:20.883
Listen...

23:21.652 --> 23:25.112
I wanted to say that I am proud of you.
And what you are trying to do.

23:25.364 --> 23:26.764
Thank you, Dad.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.081
It won't be easy.

23:30.077 --> 23:33.287
You will have to work hard at it
get it done, just like me.

23:33.330 --> 23:37.580
- There is nothing free in this world.
- I understand.

23:38.168 --> 23:41.628
You can do it, William.
I know you can do it.

23:42.631 --> 23:47.681
You are smart.
And ultimately you are also a Reid.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.288
We do not give up.

23:54.351 --> 23:55.751
Yes.

23:56.562 --> 24:00.482
That's my son.
That's my son.

24:01.191 --> 24:04.321
Well, we'll start tomorrow.

24:06.405 --> 24:08.535
Good night, I love you.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.307
I love you too, Dad.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.317
Answer B.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.133
No, William, it's A.

24:25.883 --> 24:27.843
Don't worry, don't worry.

24:36.310 --> 24:39.650
So that's 23 for math

24:39.688 --> 24:43.398
and 18 for English.

24:43.442 --> 24:47.952
About the same as when you got it
took the exam. When was that? March?

24:50.157 --> 24:51.557
Not bad.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.327
- Not good.
- Not bad.

24:55.454 --> 24:58.566
I see you working hard.
Don't let my presence bother you.

25:00.334 --> 25:01.464
Thanks.

25:01.502 --> 25:03.552
- See you at dinner.
- Bye, Dad.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.077
What was your score?

25:12.888 --> 25:16.428
I think my average was 34.

25:17.935 --> 25:19.655
That is a very high score.

25:20.479 --> 25:23.859
Yes, I was completely obsessed.
I did nothing but study.

25:23.899 --> 25:25.299
What are you doing now?

25:26.568 --> 25:30.948
I'm still studying.
I try to finish my thesis.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.319
What is it about?

25:32.366 --> 25:34.616
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

25:34.910 --> 25:40.420
The title is "Hyper-complex iterations of
generalized Mandelbrot collections ".

25:41.208 --> 25:44.128
- What does that mean?
- I get that.

25:50.759 --> 25:53.219
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

25:55.097 --> 25:58.977
It is rather difficult to explain.
Can we go into it another time?

26:00.060 --> 26:01.460
Yes.

26:01.728 --> 26:08.188
Well it seems that it is English
the hardest thing for you.

26:09.528 --> 26:12.068
So let's take a look at that.

26:13.699 --> 26:15.989
Why don't you read that out loud?

26:16.034 --> 26:17.494
- This?
- Yes.

26:21.123 --> 26:24.857
"The whole world is a stage and all men
and women in it are only actors. "

26:25.961 --> 26:28.671
"Each of them has its own
outputs and its inputs. "

26:29.173 --> 26:32.593
"Every person plays many roles
during his life. "

26:32.634 --> 26:35.974
What does the stage symbolize
this passage of Shakespeare?

26:37.639 --> 26:39.951
- What do you think?
- The stage is the same as the world.

26:40.559 --> 26:43.399
It is not the same, but symbolizes it.

26:43.937 --> 26:47.357
The stage is the stage and the world is the
world. They are two different things.

26:47.399 --> 26:49.109
Yes, they are two
different things, but ...

26:49.151 --> 26:54.451
Why do we symbolize one with something else?
Why can't we name things by their names?

26:55.073 --> 26:57.373
Well, that's called a metaphor.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.464
then maybe we come to one
deeper truth about the world?

27:05.501 --> 27:09.551
No, I think we are further from the
get rid of truth. Not closer.

27:11.131 --> 27:16.931
Well, that may be so, but they ask you
to interpret abstract text ideas.

27:16.970 --> 27:21.430
I understand what they are asking for
but I just don't like it.

27:37.199 --> 27:40.659
Maybe this is a Neanderthal thing.

27:46.834 --> 27:49.714
Okay, so ...

27:50.546 --> 27:56.296
why don't we look at this?

27:56.927 --> 28:01.887
"Twinkel, twinkel, little star ..."

28:01.932 --> 28:04.642
Are members of it today
Sigma Kai in the hall?

28:05.269 --> 28:06.736
Let me ask you a question.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.694
What do you think of it as the Theta members?
you call cavemen?

28:09.731 --> 28:11.154
That's an insult, isn't it?

28:12.526 --> 28:15.106
But not anymore.
Thanks to William.

28:15.612 --> 28:20.082
"How much do I wonder what you are ..."

28:20.117 --> 28:22.617
"GOD IS THE CREATOR OF LIFE"
- It became a crazy state for a while ...

28:22.661 --> 28:23.701
"LET THE DEAD REST"
- but as always ...

28:23.745 --> 28:25.615
"NO CLONING"
- attracted public attention ...

28:25.664 --> 28:27.424
"EMBRYOS NO LAB RATS. STOP PLAYING FOR GOD"
- quickly to other stories.

28:27.457 --> 28:31.497
I think people were disappointed then
it turned out that he was not a dangerous savage.

28:32.087 --> 28:33.207
Take a look.

28:33.255 --> 28:36.975
"High above the world ..."

28:37.009 --> 28:40.139
The traditional story that goes around,
is that we, Homo sapiens,

28:40.179 --> 28:45.179
our Neanderthal family members by our
drove higher intelligence to extinction.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.185
With every day spent on William's study,

28:47.227 --> 28:49.597
we get more reasons
to doubt this story.

28:49.646 --> 28:54.526
"Like a diamond in the sky ..."

28:54.568 --> 28:57.568
We have a close eye on William
held on the basis of a set of metrics.

28:57.613 --> 29:00.873
As I predicted,
William developed faster ...

29:00.908 --> 29:03.538
and showed one
equal or higher intelligence

29:03.577 --> 29:05.947
compared to children
from Homo sapiens.

29:06.955 --> 29:10.535
"Twinkel, twinkel, little star ..."

29:10.584 --> 29:15.264
William has the language at a very young
acquired age and developed very quickly.

29:15.547 --> 29:17.967
- Mom.
- Oh my God.

29:18.008 --> 29:20.088
- Julian.
- What happened?

29:20.135 --> 29:21.585
He said "mom."

29:21.637 --> 29:25.927
His ability to learn, his vocabulary
and his innate understanding of grammar ...

29:25.974 --> 29:31.064
are all equal to or better than that of
children of Homo sapiens at the same age.

29:31.104 --> 29:36.744
"How much do I wonder what you are ..."

29:39.154 --> 29:40.554
Just hold on, William.

29:41.031 --> 29:43.241
I love you baby, you're doing well.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.332
I'm going to talk to your doctor.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.699
Mom. Come here.

29:48.288 --> 29:50.208
He is too hot, we have to do something.

29:50.249 --> 29:52.999
We tried antibiotics,
and antiviral agents and steroids.

29:53.043 --> 29:54.673
We can do nothing more.

29:54.711 --> 29:58.631
We wanted to get to the lab
keep the operating room level sterile,

29:58.674 --> 30:01.224
- but no protocol was sufficient.
- Mom.

30:01.260 --> 30:06.010
I need you.
Please come here. Mom.

30:06.056 --> 30:07.456
He needs me.

30:07.641 --> 30:09.601
-You can't go in like that.
- Barbara, Barbara.

30:09.643 --> 30:11.043
Release.

30:15.274 --> 30:16.674
Hello Darling.

30:17.568 --> 30:19.818
It turns out it's William's immune system

30:19.862 --> 30:23.822
extraordinarily strong and adaptive,

30:23.866 --> 30:27.156
some promising medical applications
for the rest of us.

30:27.411 --> 30:32.171
There is much to learn from William
about our body and brain,

30:32.207 --> 30:34.207
and about how we are now.

30:34.251 --> 30:36.881
But more about that next week.
Thanks everyone.

30:38.922 --> 30:42.552
"Twinkel, twinkel, small star"

30:42.885 --> 30:46.765
"How much I wonder what you are."

30:47.472 --> 30:52.232
Please, Barbara, listen, this is madness.
We have a professional disagreement,

30:52.269 --> 30:54.269
but that is no reason to
to make our marriage clap.

30:54.313 --> 30:58.823
It is much more than a professional
dispute. It is about our principles.

30:59.818 --> 31:04.698
Well, then ... so I suppose that means
that you have high principles and I don't.

31:06.200 --> 31:11.620
Listen, I ... I just want with it
continue the project according to the protocol.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.333
There is no problem
that requires a solution.

31:13.373 --> 31:16.003
William is happy and healthy
in the lab.

31:16.043 --> 31:18.883
- It's a cage and he deserves better than that.
- A cage?

31:18.921 --> 31:21.881
You have contributed to the design
of all aspects of his care.

31:21.924 --> 31:25.344
You have his complete genome. You need
not having him there in person.

31:25.385 --> 31:27.135
No, you know that's not true.

31:27.179 --> 31:29.809
We have to see how his genes are during
express its development.

31:29.848 --> 31:33.978
Listen, Barbara, it's our responsibility
to study him there as well as possible.

31:34.019 --> 31:37.689
Which study?
You have already proven your point.

31:37.981 --> 31:43.151
He is just as human as you are.
Nothing can be learned anymore.

31:45.322 --> 31:47.720
What happened to my
brilliant science partner?

31:49.368 --> 31:50.768
I'm a mother.

31:52.454 --> 31:54.044
I have to take care of my son.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.231
He is not your son.

32:01.004 --> 32:04.014
Barbara, Barbara, wait.
Please, Barbara, I'm sorry ...

32:05.676 --> 32:07.076
Damn.

32:13.183 --> 32:14.983
But what about media attention?

32:17.271 --> 32:19.111
I'm worried of course, but ...

32:20.190 --> 32:23.610
We have had almost two years
no longer receive press questions.

32:24.236 --> 32:26.356
I think the novelty
is worn off.

32:27.364 --> 32:31.624
He is just so remarkably normal.

32:33.954 --> 32:36.924
Over time it is
no longer such an interesting story.

32:37.958 --> 32:40.168
That can change in an instant.

32:40.711 --> 32:42.301
What about your own work?

32:43.255 --> 32:49.765
Okay, I will keep my academic position
I continue to do part-time research,

32:51.013 --> 32:55.523
but I am losing my seniority
and my chance of a permanent appointment.

32:55.934 --> 32:57.334
Sorry.

32:57.519 --> 33:01.609
Well, there is an existing protocol,

33:02.274 --> 33:05.404
that I have to make a proposal
to the supervisory committee.

33:06.612 --> 33:09.742
- You preside.
- I preside.

33:11.742 --> 33:13.202
Thank you, Godwin.

33:25.506 --> 33:28.926
- I want to see it.
- Be careful.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.080
Yes.

33:35.766 --> 33:37.306
Yes, we are going there.

33:47.319 --> 33:51.029
Well, this is the clinic where I'm going to work.

33:51.073 --> 33:54.583
We will live in that apartment.
Up there.

33:58.664 --> 34:03.084
This is the kitchen.
The living room is inside.

34:03.585 --> 34:06.585
Yes, there is enough space
to run around.

34:09.424 --> 34:11.974
Where is my room?

34:13.344 --> 34:15.005
Hey, easy, William.

34:19.226 --> 34:22.146
- Is this my room?
- Yes.

34:35.993 --> 34:39.663
- What do you think about it?
- It's great, Mom.

34:41.373 --> 34:42.873
It is really amazing.

34:48.714 --> 34:51.054
I just wish Dad were here.

34:54.136 --> 34:55.886
He comes to visit us.

34:56.929 --> 35:02.390
He will actually come here on Monday
for your first school day.

35:09.401 --> 35:11.651
I think we are here very
will be happy.

35:13.572 --> 35:15.782
Dr. Reid, I think you
the island community

35:15.823 --> 35:19.123
very tolerant and
diversity-welcoming.

35:19.870 --> 35:22.660
Dr. Sullivan and I already have
long discussions

35:23.582 --> 35:27.632
about William's special circumstances,
but for you we can discuss ...

35:28.086 --> 35:31.916
- What circumstances?
- I mean, his allo-human personality.

35:32.674 --> 35:35.344
- What?
- His allo-human personality.

35:35.385 --> 35:36.885
I do not know what that means.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.807
Dr. Reid, William is a Neanderthal.

35:42.518 --> 35:46.098
William is a highly intelligent
human child.

35:46.146 --> 35:50.186
I expect you to treat him
just like any other student.

35:50.234 --> 35:51.834
That is hypocritical, that you state that.

35:53.153 --> 35:56.663
We treat every child equally while we
value each one as a unique individual.

35:56.698 --> 36:00.538
- How do you do both things at the same time?
- That's the challenge, right?

36:00.577 --> 36:03.707
"Good morning everyone, how are you?"

36:04.623 --> 36:07.383
"Good morning everyone, how are you?"

36:08.210 --> 36:11.960
"Good morning everyone,
good morning everyone"

36:12.005 --> 36:14.715
"Good morning everyone, how are you?"

36:15.467 --> 36:18.297
"Good morning, William, how are you?"

36:19.096 --> 36:21.886
"Good morning, Jackie, how are you?"

36:22.641 --> 36:26.061
"Good morning, Ruby, Good morning, Nelson."

36:26.103 --> 36:27.983
"Good morning, Heather ..."

36:28.021 --> 36:31.571
You can put your personal feelings aside
and consider that this can be good for him?

36:31.608 --> 36:36.108
"Good morning, Morrison,
Good morning Marcus, how are you? "

36:36.822 --> 36:39.532
"Good morning, William, how are you?"
- Thanks.

36:40.409 --> 36:43.159
"Good morning, Jackie, how are you?"

36:43.912 --> 36:46.332
- How was your first day of school?
- It was amazing.

36:46.373 --> 36:49.583
- My best friend's name is Moch.
- Moosh?

36:50.335 --> 36:53.455
- Moch. Funny name.
- It's an abbreviation for Morrison.

36:54.381 --> 37:01.093
- I get it.
- There is a lizard in a cage and a fish.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.813
Yes that are they.

37:07.728 --> 37:09.848
May I please
more meatloaf?

37:10.272 --> 37:14.112
Yes of course.
Wow, you are a bottomless pit.

37:15.569 --> 37:17.069
- Please.
- Thanks.

37:17.112 --> 37:18.512
You're welcome.

37:18.655 --> 37:21.985
Okay, I'll take this.

37:22.534 --> 37:24.204
- I just want a little bit of you.
- Don't worry.

37:24.244 --> 37:26.544
A little bit ... Just a little bit.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.250
Hey, look, what was that?

37:31.585 --> 37:33.345
I'll show you some pictures.

37:33.378 --> 37:36.267
And I want you to tell me
what's the first thing you're thinking of, okay?

37:37.341 --> 37:38.741
Cool.

37:40.844 --> 37:42.244
Rabbit.

37:44.515 --> 37:45.915
Cat.

37:47.851 --> 37:49.251
Penguin.

37:51.813 --> 37:54.273
Sunset.
- That was a good answer.

37:55.025 --> 38:00.485
I also made more difficult cards
and I want to see how you do it, okay?

38:07.829 --> 38:10.699
Glad.
- Good.

38:12.751 --> 38:14.151
Sad.

38:17.881 --> 38:19.281
Angry.

38:20.717 --> 38:22.117
Well done.

38:23.136 --> 38:26.216
B ... Afraid.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.582
Well done.

38:33.689 --> 38:35.229
I love you, daddy.

38:38.443 --> 38:40.033
I'm very proud of you.

38:41.488 --> 38:43.568
You have a bright future
do you know?

38:44.616 --> 38:50.906
Top marks at school, scholarship at Wallace
University and then graduation.

38:52.624 --> 38:54.674
Maybe you will someday
a professor like me.

38:54.710 --> 38:56.290
- Yet?
- Right.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.070
I'm proud of you.

39:12.311 --> 39:13.711
Well done, son.

39:31.288 --> 39:32.688
Here you are.

39:33.582 --> 39:37.632
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you,
but I think we have to work.

39:38.378 --> 39:40.838
- Yes.
- Okay.

39:45.719 --> 39:47.719
"This is a valley of ash,"

39:48.305 --> 39:51.475
"a fantastic farm
where ash grows like weeds "

39:51.517 --> 39:54.557
"to mountain ranges, hills and
grotesque gardens. "

39:54.811 --> 39:59.151
"Where ash takes the forms of houses,
chimneys and rising smoke, "

39:59.191 --> 40:06.191
"and finally through an excellent one
effort shaped like ash gray men. "

40:06.240 --> 40:07.870
Do you know the source of this quote?

40:07.908 --> 40:09.448
- "The Great Gatsby".
- Well done.

40:10.369 --> 40:14.789
So what does "The Valley of Ash" symbolize?

40:14.831 --> 40:16.231
It symbolizes ashes.

40:17.459 --> 40:20.459
Come on William
You promised to try.

40:21.505 --> 40:24.555
- The valley of ash.
- Okay.

40:24.967 --> 40:26.627
Death and dissolution.

40:27.886 --> 40:29.466
Gatsby's birthplace.

40:29.763 --> 40:33.813
The past he is ashamed of,
and is afraid to return to.

40:34.601 --> 40:36.001
Good.

40:36.645 --> 40:40.485
- That's what they want me to say.
- They want your own interpretation.

40:40.524 --> 40:43.694
- No, they don't want him.
- William ...

40:43.735 --> 40:47.815
What if you were a happy ash girl,
with your happy lover of ash?

40:47.865 --> 40:53.295
You like ash and your city is made of it.
Ash symbolizes health and happiness.

40:54.246 --> 40:57.996
Well, then we have it
about literary irony or something.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.632
No, we both know I have a bad one
get a rating if I answer that way.

41:01.670 --> 41:05.470
There is a correct interpretation of it
the text. But who decides?

41:05.507 --> 41:08.427
These symbols and metaphors are fake.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.720
Why is this so important to you?

41:12.139 --> 41:15.139
Because I feel like something
is taken away from me.

41:31.158 --> 41:32.558
Good.

41:38.248 --> 41:39.648
Good.

41:45.130 --> 41:46.970
See, that's the caveman.

41:48.467 --> 41:49.867
You're gonna get a beating.

41:51.887 --> 41:53.557
Come back, caveman.

41:59.478 --> 42:01.688
Wait a minute, we just want to talk to you.

42:03.524 --> 42:04.924
What is going on?

42:06.360 --> 42:07.760
He cave boy.

42:08.904 --> 42:10.304
Why are you in such a hurry?

42:15.953 --> 42:18.463
Come on.

42:22.209 --> 42:23.609
Come on man.

42:25.546 --> 42:27.086
We just want to talk to you.

42:34.096 --> 42:35.496
Shit.

42:40.018 --> 42:41.418
Shit.

42:44.356 --> 42:46.516
Get him. Hold him, hold him.

42:48.068 --> 42:49.468
Ahhh.

42:52.406 --> 42:54.184
Okay, cave boy, let's handle this.

43:03.542 --> 43:06.802
- He's dangerous.
- Darlene, I can't file a complaint

43:06.837 --> 43:08.917
every time two boys get into a fight.

43:08.964 --> 43:12.514
He wasn't arguing.
My son attacked that horror.

43:12.551 --> 43:14.891
- He practically broke his hand.
- Nothing's broken.

43:14.928 --> 43:17.080
What difference does it make
whether it is broken or not?

43:17.097 --> 43:20.727
- I know William wants to apologize to your son.
- I don't want a damn apology.

43:20.767 --> 43:24.597
- I want to have that thing locked up.
- Okay, okay, we're done here, okay?

43:24.646 --> 43:25.556
- Don't you do anything?
- I'm not going to do anything.

43:25.606 --> 43:27.066
- Really?
- We're done here.

43:27.107 --> 43:28.357
- Wow.
- Go home.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.240
- It's over, go home, okay?
- Good.

43:31.862 --> 43:33.262
Wow, Jerry.

43:37.409 --> 43:39.909
Thank you, Jerry, it won't happen again.

43:41.371 --> 43:46.131
- They said you started the fight.
- That's not true, they followed me.

43:46.168 --> 43:50.628
- Why did they follow you?
- I do not know.

43:50.668 --> 43:52.228
They called me a caveman.

44:10.317 --> 44:13.277
William, these people ...

44:15.030 --> 44:19.830
Some people don't understand. We can
don't expect them to understand.

44:21.161 --> 44:24.081
But you can never do such a thing again.

44:25.582 --> 44:26.982
Never.

44:27.251 --> 44:31.881
Whatever they said,
you just have to walk away from them, okay?

44:35.509 --> 44:38.179
Do you promise me this?
- I promise.

44:41.932 --> 44:46.562
- You are not a caveman.
- I know that, I'm Neanderthal.

44:48.272 --> 44:54.032
That's true.
That means that you are very special.

- You can't catch me.
- Yes, I can.

46:23.367 --> 46:25.367
William, it's dinner time.

46:26.245 --> 46:29.665
- Wow. I'm hungry.
- You are always hungry.

46:34.378 --> 46:37.298
- Who is that?
- Oh, that's Ted.

46:37.673 --> 46:39.673
- Who is Ted?
- Mom's friend.

46:40.342 --> 46:42.342
- Hello, Ted.
- William.

46:43.428 --> 46:44.828
Hey.

46:51.854 --> 46:54.064
Come on everybody.
The lasagna is on the table.

46:54.106 --> 46:56.266
- Lasagna.
- Go ahead.

46:56.316 --> 46:58.860
What? Come on, dad, please.

46:58.527 --> 47:02.157
I completely forgot about me
attend a graduate seminar.

47:03.407 --> 47:06.527
- Dad...
- Next time, buddy, okay?

47:12.958 --> 47:15.338
Okay, see you in two weeks.

47:16.170 --> 47:17.880
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

47:27.139 --> 47:30.229
- What time did he say he was here?
- Three o'clock.

47:40.861 --> 47:42.261
Sorry, William.

47:50.329 --> 47:51.959
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:54.208 --> 47:56.838
- You must Dr. Be Sullivan.
- Yes.

47:57.127 --> 47:59.839
I'm Jacqueline Deval.
I'm here to work with William.

48:01.089 --> 48:04.009
- Where is Dr. Reid?
- He has a conflicting appointment now.

48:04.051 --> 48:07.563
He asked me to do the tests. I'm
a graduate student in his lab.

48:11.642 --> 48:15.312
He didn't tell you I'd come.
- No, he didn't.

48:16.188 --> 48:18.398
Hello Julian,
what the hell are you doing?

48:19.566 --> 48:22.436
What do you mean? I mean, you send
a stranger without informing us,

48:22.486 --> 48:24.566
instead of being there for your son.

48:26.365 --> 48:29.205
No, I will not invite her
for dinner with Ted.

48:30.744 --> 48:32.211
What do you think I'm talking about?

48:33.872 --> 48:35.462
You can't be a bigger bastard.

48:36.458 --> 48:39.038
Okay, let's get started.

50:25.234 --> 50:27.244
And was it horrible or horrible?

50:27.653 --> 50:29.053
Terrible.

50:29.655 --> 50:31.055
Horrible.

50:35.410 --> 50:36.370
Judy.

50:36.411 --> 50:38.831
- How did it go?
- Good.

50:40.249 --> 50:41.649
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

50:42.960 --> 50:45.920
Listen, I was too busy
with studying for the test,

50:45.963 --> 50:48.541
so I had no more time
to practice my texts.

50:48.924 --> 50:51.594
Do you think you can come on Sunday?
to practice them with me?

50:51.969 --> 50:53.849
- Yes.
- No, you can't.

50:53.887 --> 50:55.887
- We're going camping.
- Yes.

50:57.015 --> 50:59.725
- No.
- Oh, okay.

51:01.395 --> 51:03.522
But you will come to the rehearsal session
on Monday, right?

51:03.647 --> 51:05.607
- Yes.
- Good.

51:05.649 --> 51:07.049
Okidoki.

51:07.276 --> 51:10.066
- I hope you come back alive.
- Yes.

51:12.364 --> 51:14.704
- Well done, dude.
- Yes.

51:19.454 --> 51:23.964
Okay, brother William, how do you like this joke. Get what
you like crossing an elephant with a rhino?

51:26.211 --> 51:29.461
- I do not know.
- An oil horn.

51:33.093 --> 51:34.933
- Do you get it?
- It's funny, dude.

51:34.970 --> 51:36.760
- No.
- Okay.

51:43.687 --> 51:45.727
- Nosefant.
- What?

51:46.356 --> 51:47.776
A nose fan.

51:50.360 --> 51:52.820
- Is that funny?
- Yes, yes, that's funny.

51:54.489 --> 51:56.801
- That's a good joke, I liked it.
- Yes man.

52:02.998 --> 52:04.643
Is your mother already texting you?

52:08.337 --> 52:10.737
We finally have you
got off the island, man.

52:12.716 --> 52:14.139
Since when have you been there?

52:14.426 --> 52:16.720
Since we moved here,
when I was five years old.

52:16.845 --> 52:18.255
- Damn.
- That's madness.

52:19.598 --> 52:20.998
Indeed.

52:21.683 --> 52:23.183
You must let go of the beast.

52:24.061 --> 52:25.651
Free the beast.

52:37.658 --> 52:39.488
- Will.
- Yes?

52:39.826 --> 52:42.746
Have you heard of that stewardess?
who ran backwards against the propeller?

52:42.871 --> 52:44.751
- No.
- Disaster.

52:45.958 --> 52:48.714
- I don't understand.
- "Dis-assed-her". She lost her ass.

52:56.635 --> 52:58.765
But that is very sad.

53:24.413 --> 53:28.213
Just put that in it
and stick it in the ground and ...

53:28.250 --> 53:29.710
Ok, thanks for the help.

53:29.751 --> 53:32.421
What are you doing? You should have them
before putting them in the tent.

53:32.462 --> 53:35.974
I'm going to write my college essay about
setting up this ridiculous tent.

53:36.133 --> 53:38.400
I think we do the whole thing
have inside out.

53:38.552 --> 53:40.012
- Really?
- Look at this.

53:40.053 --> 53:42.473
- This is ridiculous.
- I give up.

53:45.642 --> 53:47.042
And that thing must be here.

53:48.103 --> 53:48.663
You see?

53:48.729 --> 53:51.609
- Can you write the college essay for me?
- No.

53:56.612 --> 53:59.612
- Which universities will you apply for?
- A few places ...

53:59.656 --> 54:04.286
- Oregon State University and Evergreen.
- And I'm going to sign up for the University of Video Games

54:04.620 --> 54:07.331
- You must have a back-up university.
- Cross-border University?

54:07.456 --> 54:10.036
- University of higher education?
- Exactly.

54:12.503 --> 54:15.133
- You're going to Wallace University, right?
- If I am allowed.

54:15.172 --> 54:18.972
- You will come in.
- You are the ultimate example of positive discrimination.

54:19.009 --> 54:21.719
No not true.
He is about the best student in school.

54:21.762 --> 54:25.540
- Judy is the best student at school.
- Judy is the best looking student at school.

54:26.558 --> 54:27.978
I think he blushes.

54:29.144 --> 54:30.544
Oh, Will.

54:34.733 --> 54:37.573
Listen Will, how do fish get high?

54:38.612 --> 54:41.452
- You never stop joking.
- Sea weed.

54:42.199 --> 54:44.369
- Do you understand?
- No.

54:44.409 --> 54:45.809
That was a good joke.

54:51.625 --> 54:55.055
- How do you like it here, Will?
- I love it.

54:56.922 --> 54:59.552
- Namaste.
- Wow. You scared me an accident.

55:00.050 --> 55:03.220
- Goodbye.
- Hey.

55:03.470 --> 55:04.970
This is a peaceful place.

55:15.524 --> 55:19.494
- Do you want to join us?
- Cool.

55:20.988 --> 55:24.068
- Man.
- What are these?

55:24.575 --> 55:28.455
- Mushrooms.
- Completely organic, completely safe.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.480
I thank you for that.

55:33.250 --> 55:35.170
- No thanks.
- Thanks.

55:35.210 --> 55:40.010
what are you doing?
Yo. Marcus.

55:40.048 --> 55:43.515
The main reason to go camping
is to leave your parents at home, dude.

55:46.346 --> 55:47.746
It's cool, man.

55:48.432 --> 55:51.482
- Yes, dude, take as much as you want.
- Thanks.

55:58.650 --> 56:00.110
Just like popcorn.

56:08.827 --> 56:11.157
So you are sitting
in high school?

56:11.914 --> 56:15.214
- The high school's cool.
- High school is not cool.

56:20.088 --> 56:21.488
Yes.

56:21.965 --> 56:23.365
And what are you doing?

56:24.760 --> 56:28.300
We make jewelry from
organic fibers and sea shells,

56:28.347 --> 56:30.967
and we sell them up
festivals and concerts.

56:31.016 --> 56:35.186
- That is cool. Do you earn a living with that?
- No man.

56:37.022 --> 56:43.072
We are not trying to earn a living,
but we just live, you understand?

56:48.033 --> 56:51.953
This is one of the pieces that we have
made. They are made entirely from hemp.

57:12.015 --> 57:14.765
- You are beautiful.
- He's a Neanderthal.

57:17.020 --> 57:19.980
- Marcus. What the hell are you doing, man?
- Is it a secret?

57:23.735 --> 57:25.135
No.

57:30.409 --> 57:32.989
You are that young man from the university.

57:35.664 --> 57:37.064
Yes.

57:40.210 --> 57:42.130
This is cool.

57:42.921 --> 57:46.551
This is so cool, man.

57:49.970 --> 57:52.560
- Thanks.
- Yes.

57:53.056 --> 57:54.456
Wow.

57:57.144 --> 58:01.444
- Would you ever go back?
- We just got here.

58:10.407 --> 58:14.827
Back ... back, do you understand what I mean?
Go back to your time.

58:15.078 --> 58:16.708
He is not a time traveler.

58:22.252 --> 58:23.652
I'm not feeling well.

58:24.713 --> 58:27.673
It's okay, man.
It's okay, that's a natural feeling.

58:27.716 --> 58:29.316
Just breathe in until it's over.

58:35.265 --> 58:36.665
Yes.

58:43.023 --> 58:44.443
Then go there.

58:48.862 --> 58:52.822
This is not cool, man.
Not cool.

59:27.109 --> 59:30.279
- "What did you think she wouldn't notice?"
- "I didn't think about it at all."

59:30.320 --> 59:31.570
"Typically a man."

59:31.613 --> 59:34.533
No, you only repeat that sentence
"She certainly noticed."

59:36.702 --> 59:38.332
Right, damn it.

59:40.747 --> 59:44.207
- So you say ...
- "Did you think she wouldn't notice?"

59:44.626 --> 59:47.126
"I didn't think about it at all."
"She certainly noticed."

59:47.171 --> 59:49.921
- You say...
- "I didn't think you'd mind."

59:50.716 --> 59:52.796
- Right.
- This starts the music.

59:52.843 --> 59:55.803
This is going to be disastrous.
I always forget my texts.

59:55.846 --> 59:59.216
You will do well, Judy.
Just improvise if you forget.

59:59.756 --> 01:00:01.806
But then the band doesn't know
when they have to start playing.

01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:09.615
You are so calm.
How do you do that?

01:00:32.299 --> 01:00:33.719
Be careful.

01:00:54.655 --> 01:00:58.049
"From time to time"

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:04.500
"I notice that I pretend ..."

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.920
"You will hold my hand."

01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:13.959
"And then you whisper to me
words of love. "

01:01:16.855 --> 01:01:20.255
"From time to time"

01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:26.021
"I notice that I dream about him"

01:01:26.478 --> 01:01:33.478
"He is holding my hand
against his heart forever. "

01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:48.461
"From time to time"

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.340
"From time to time"

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:58.890
"she won't see me
like more than a friend "

01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:06.261
"From time to time."

01:02:18.155 --> 01:02:19.555
You were great.

01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:54.089
Well done.

01:02:55.692 --> 01:02:57.092
Well done.

01:02:59.363 --> 01:03:01.033
It was amazing.

01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:03.891
Judy.

01:04:01.383 --> 01:04:05.933
His grades are good, but he
has difficulty with standardized tests.

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:11.230
- What is going on?
- The problem is not the intelligence,

01:04:11.268 --> 01:04:16.478
but his cognitive patterns do not come
corresponds to one of the known models.

01:04:16.523 --> 01:04:19.733
It's ... it's unique.

01:04:20.986 --> 01:04:25.066
Of course intelligence is ultimately
only to measure what intelligence tests.

01:04:26.283 --> 01:04:27.683
OK.

01:04:29.203 --> 01:04:30.913
What about intensive guidance?

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:32.414
Yes, I definitely recommend it.

01:04:32.456 --> 01:04:35.923
Especially if he is in the future again
submit an application to the university.

01:04:36.627 --> 01:04:39.297
Excuse me, did you say resubmit?

01:04:41.048 --> 01:04:45.588
He has ... withdrawn his applications.

01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:51.133
- I assumed you were familiar with this decision.
- Ho, ho, ho, moment.

01:04:51.475 --> 01:04:54.815
Did you first ask William about it?

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:04.970
I can not believe this.

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:13.540
Well, what will William do then?
after graduation?

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:15.917
He was offered a part-time job.

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:19.166
- True?
- Iron shop

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:27.676
Okay, I want William
comes to live with me after graduation.

01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:29.719
You just want to return it
to the lab to perform tests.

01:05:29.763 --> 01:05:33.223
I want him to live in the real world
and stops hiding.

01:05:33.267 --> 01:05:36.687
Do you really think Wallace University
is the real world?

01:05:36.728 --> 01:05:39.808
Is it less real than that ridiculous
island where you keep him imprisoned?

01:05:39.857 --> 01:05:44.107
With false lighthouses and on pets
looking T-shirt stores and all that nonsense?

01:05:44.152 --> 01:05:45.822
I'm trying to do that
what is best for him.

01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:46.703
No, you don't.

01:05:47.823 --> 01:05:50.833
because you like to play family
with that colorless Ted.

01:05:50.868 --> 01:05:54.880
Since he was born, you tried him
to prove something about yourself,

01:06:00.711 --> 01:06:03.801
Nobody in the world is left with anything more
facing challenges than William.

01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:09.259
Well, I think the question should be
what is best for William,

01:06:09.761 --> 01:06:12.181
and how he develops as a person.

01:06:12.222 --> 01:06:14.489
In that respect I think
that he is doing fantastic.

01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:17.917
Either way, the decision is not
to you. Neither of you.

01:06:18.687 --> 01:06:20.517
William turns 18 in a few weeks.

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:33.156
- Brother William, I have a joke for you.
- What?

01:06:34.536 --> 01:06:36.326
Why did the cookie go to the doctor?

01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:40.009
I honestly don't understand why
you find these things funny.

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:42.920
Because he felt broken.

01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:47.632
Don't you understand him?

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:51.970
- Do you understand him? Broken?
- I understand, but I don't understand.

01:07:00.437 --> 01:07:01.347
Many have already received a reply,

01:07:01.396 --> 01:07:02.306
Jackson goes to the UCLA,

01:07:02.356 --> 01:07:04.490
Ellie to Evergreen,
and Judy goes to Columbia.

01:07:05.901 --> 01:07:07.491
Judy goes to Columbia.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.100
Oregon State University ...

01:07:16.703 --> 01:07:20.293
I only got rejections.
My parents went crazy.

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:25.747
- Yes, backup university then ...
- I think so.

01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:31.801
- Oregon State University.
- Yes, yes, should be good.

01:07:31.844 --> 01:07:33.434
- Awesome.
- Thanks man.

01:07:36.306 --> 01:07:38.426
- Backup university.
- Thanks man.

01:07:44.731 --> 01:07:48.441
It is better to apply
to fill in ...

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:29.279
William, I want you for yourself
find a place in the world.

01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:32.569
Going to college
like your classmates.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:37.529
You have the capacities for it,
and I think you know that.

01:08:37.576 --> 01:08:40.826
- He just wants you back in his lab.
- Yes, that's part of it.

01:08:40.871 --> 01:08:42.911
- You don't have to be his lab rat.
- William, William ...

01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:47.706
There are many areas
of promising new research ...

01:08:48.045 --> 01:08:49.595
Even outside of work,

01:08:53.341 --> 01:08:57.142
It might be the key to a new one
treatments that can help millions of people.

01:08:57.179 --> 01:08:58.849
- Or not.
- Or not.

01:08:58.889 --> 01:09:01.679
But we won't know
unless we try.

01:09:14.654 --> 01:09:17.165
This is much bigger
then you and me, William.

01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:24.002
I want to go to Wallace University,

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.290
- but as a student.
- I'll talk to the Dean of Admission ...

01:09:29.336 --> 01:09:30.546
- No, dad.
- I'm sure we can arrange something.

01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:31.417
- I ...
- What?

01:09:31.462 --> 01:09:35.843
I want to earn it ...
Just like everyone else.

01:09:38.095 --> 01:09:42.064
OK. I respect that.

01:09:45.457 --> 01:09:50.767
If you achieve that, go with it
agree to participate in the study?

01:09:50.816 --> 01:09:53.145
William, you have to
nothing to decide yet.

01:09:56.655 --> 01:09:58.055
Yes.

01:10:01.743 --> 01:10:03.143
Fantastic.

01:10:04.913 --> 01:10:06.313
Fantastic.

01:10:13.839 --> 01:10:17.049
Oh, man, I'll help you get your scores
increase. It's going to be fun.

01:12:08.453 --> 01:12:10.503
These are very good scores.

01:12:15.127 --> 01:12:16.527
They really are.

01:12:23.427 --> 01:12:25.217
Let's go for a walk.

01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:29.123
Come on.

01:12:54.541 --> 01:13:00.051
This is not your fault, William.
Julian is under great pressure.

01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:02.990
Whose?

01:13:04.843 --> 01:13:06.243
I do not know.

01:13:13.185 --> 01:13:18.655
Every time I scored lower than a 10
my mother hit me with a ruler.

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:22.070
And then she cried afterwards.

01:13:22.903 --> 01:13:27.243
My father worked day and night
to pay private teachers,

01:13:27.282 --> 01:13:31.292
and the ballet lessons and all other lessons.
I hardly saw him.

01:13:32.079 --> 01:13:36.249
They had a complete plan for it
my life, and that is why I hated them.

01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:40.443
But I now know that
they just tried to help me.

01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:46.588
- Without them I would not have been where I am now.
- Where are you now?

01:13:47.928 --> 01:13:51.468
Where am I now?
Wow...

01:13:53.058 --> 01:13:55.768
I try to complete my thesis,

01:13:55.811 --> 01:13:58.981
who doesn't care.

01:14:00.691 --> 01:14:07.691
And I have a relationship with one
dissatisfied father figure.

01:14:13.453 --> 01:14:18.123
- And walking in the woods.
- And walking in the woods.

01:14:19.626 --> 01:14:22.086
- With me.
- With you.

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:26.840
I like that part.

01:14:36.018 --> 01:14:39.148
- I heard you like to sing.
- Yes.

01:14:40.063 --> 01:14:42.073
What kind of songs do you like to sing?

01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:45.092
Many species,

01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:48.609
Songs of plays,
pop songs and rock songs.

01:14:48.655 --> 01:14:52.195
- Songs of plays? Really?
- Yes.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.870
I'm a little curious ...

01:14:54.912 --> 01:14:59.922
They are often abstract texts
and full of metaphors.

01:15:01.627 --> 01:15:06.047
- Doesn't that bother you?
- I just ignore that.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.240
The rhythm and melody are
completely logical for me.

01:15:34.618 --> 01:15:37.198
- I do not know.
- Come on.

01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:47.761
- Please?
- Okay.

01:15:56.723 --> 01:16:00.143
"From time to time"

01:16:01.144 --> 01:16:06.024
"I notice that I pretend"

01:16:06.942 --> 01:16:08.782
"You will hold my hand."

01:16:08.819 --> 01:16:15.819
"Then you whisper
me words of love "

01:16:19.955 --> 01:16:24.965
"From time to time"

01:16:29.882 --> 01:16:35.932
"You will not see me as
more than a friend."

01:16:37.973 --> 01:16:39.183
- Excuses.
- Sorry.

01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:43.925
It's from my high school musical.

01:16:47.941 --> 01:16:49.981
- Sing with me.
- No.

01:16:56.408 --> 01:16:58.578
I told you I'm tone deaf.

01:16:58.619 --> 01:17:02.539
"From time to time"

01:17:03.123 --> 01:17:08.503
"You will not see me
like more than a friend "

01:17:09.129 --> 01:17:13.299
"From time to time"

01:21:47.157 --> 01:21:49.237
I'm here to pick you up at 12:00.

01:24:04.545 --> 01:24:05.945
You bastards.

01:24:27.109 --> 01:24:28.509
Take a look.

01:24:59.641 --> 01:25:04.151
- Do you want water or tea?
- Water, please.

01:25:07.191 --> 01:25:10.191
Well, what brings you here?

01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:13.074
I'm not sure.

01:25:26.251 --> 01:25:29.251
You found me, right?

01:25:29.555 --> 01:25:32.095
Well, it looks like you found me.

01:25:33.467 --> 01:25:37.677
No, I mean ... my remains

01:25:40.015 --> 01:25:41.415
I understand.

01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:45.085
Yes I did that.

01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:48.982
Would you like to see it?

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.580
- Yes.
- Dr. Sullivan, hello.

01:26:07.626 --> 01:26:10.666
I am Sara
Dr. Reid's girlfriend.

01:26:12.047 --> 01:26:13.507
Apologies for disturbing you.

01:26:14.174 --> 01:26:19.684
I stand in front of the exam center and I thought there
maybe a timetable error or something is made.

01:26:19.721 --> 01:26:21.221
Is William with you?

01:26:22.224 --> 01:26:27.774
No fossil in the normal sense of the word.
It is what is known as a swampy.

01:26:28.063 --> 01:26:30.073
It is essentially a mummy.

01:26:30.107 --> 01:26:35.857
Preserved by tannins and it
low oxygen content in the peat.

01:26:36.655 --> 01:26:38.115
OK ...

01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:38.260
- Like he wants to say something.
- I always thought so.

01:27:40.469 --> 01:27:42.509
Maybe he's talking to you.

01:27:49.686 --> 01:27:51.086
How did he die?

01:27:53.148 --> 01:27:55.108
In fact, nobody knows for sure.

01:27:55.567 --> 01:28:02.527
There was no trace of violence, or one
clear infection, illness or nutritional deficiency.

01:28:03.075 --> 01:28:06.165
Maybe he's just
got stuck in the mud.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.480
How did they become extinct?

01:28:11.625 --> 01:28:15.595
People have many ideas,
but nobody knows for sure.

01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:19.419
- What do you think it was?
- Well, that's just a guess,

01:28:19.466 --> 01:28:23.006
but I think Homo sapiens

01:28:23.053 --> 01:28:28.733
developed the ability to complex
create stories and believe in them.

01:28:29.017 --> 01:28:34.517
Stories that can form connections
between larger groups than the family.

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:39.110
These groups have succeeded by their numeric
dominance over the Neanderthals

01:28:39.152 --> 01:28:44.662
forcing them to live in less favorable habitats.
Which ultimately caused their extinction.

01:28:53.959 --> 01:28:55.339
What kind of stories?

01:28:55.377 --> 01:29:01.877
Stories such as why our tribe, our country
or our God is above that of others.

01:29:02.342 --> 01:29:05.972
Why they should be prepared
to die in defense thereof.

01:29:06.638 --> 01:29:09.018
- You mean religion?
- Yes.

01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:15.856
And family stories.

01:29:17.816 --> 01:29:20.186
Yes, family stories.

01:29:26.283 --> 01:29:28.995
Is it intelligent to believe
in things that are not true?

01:29:29.494 --> 01:29:35.174
Do you feel less intelligent?
Less human?

01:29:39.755 --> 01:29:43.515
I feel that I am forced
to live in a less favorable habitat,

01:29:44.384 --> 01:29:46.054
because of your numerical dominance.

01:30:42.568 --> 01:30:47.068
William, you have a place here.

01:30:54.466 --> 01:30:57.286
- Dr. Sullivan?
- Sara?

01:30:57.332 --> 01:30:59.422
- Do you have contact with him?
- No you?

01:30:59.459 --> 01:31:01.799
No, he doesn't answer his phone.
Was he upset this morning?

01:31:01.837 --> 01:31:03.627
He was upset and nervous.

01:31:04.965 --> 01:31:07.935
I am so sorry about all this.

01:31:09.136 --> 01:31:10.536
This is not your fault.

01:31:11.722 --> 01:31:16.482
He told me how friendly
you were. How nice he likes you.

01:31:22.983 --> 01:31:24.383
I know that.

01:31:29.114 --> 01:31:31.204
Why are you driving me?
not just going to college?

01:31:31.241 --> 01:31:34.661
I'm going to talk to Julian.
And then you can search for him here.

01:31:37.331 --> 01:31:40.131
This is a Neanderthal.

01:31:42.503 --> 01:31:45.673
His name is William,
he is a stupid barbarian.

01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:50.716
A growling savage, a caveman.

01:31:52.471 --> 01:31:56.601
Not everyone at Wallace University
was happy to reproduce William.

01:31:56.642 --> 01:31:59.852
But one must sometimes break the rules
to make progress.

01:32:01.813 --> 01:32:06.693
The extensive study of the genes
and William's behavior

01:32:07.319 --> 01:32:12.069
is one of the largest scientific
have been breakthroughs in modern times.

01:32:12.115 --> 01:32:13.515
No, that's not it.

01:32:18.997 --> 01:32:22.707
As you can see, William is recently
graduated from high school.

01:32:22.751 --> 01:32:29.301
He is now preparing to participate
extensive studies here at Wallace University.

01:32:29.341 --> 01:32:31.631
- No he does not.
- Excuse me?

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:36.692
I said he won't do that.

01:32:38.141 --> 01:32:42.811
William, not now and not here.

01:32:42.855 --> 01:32:44.985
- This is my job.
- Your job.

01:32:45.399 --> 01:32:50.029
You know nothing about your work.

01:32:55.409 --> 01:32:56.829
Your work has failed.

01:32:57.578 --> 01:32:58.978
No, William.

01:33:02.249 --> 01:33:03.649
- You failed.
- Hmm.

01:33:16.889 --> 01:33:18.289
William.

01:33:19.516 --> 01:33:20.916
William.

01:33:22.019 --> 01:33:23.419
Stop.

01:33:24.354 --> 01:33:26.904
Hi, William.
Will ..., William, do you want to quit?

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.570
Please wait, William.

01:33:31.612 --> 01:33:36.412
William, I'm sorry for what I said.

01:33:38.035 --> 01:33:40.665
But you embarrassed me
for everyone in the room.

01:33:40.704 --> 01:33:42.664
No, you did that yourself.

01:33:47.211 --> 01:33:50.421
OK. Just go home and
we'll talk about it later.

01:33:50.464 --> 01:33:51.864
We don't do that.

01:33:54.927 --> 01:33:56.327
What did you say?

01:33:57.095 --> 01:33:58.950
You are not my father.

01:34:12.986 --> 01:34:14.696
William, William. Wait.

01:34:14.738 --> 01:34:17.488
William, William, do you want to quit?

01:34:26.875 --> 01:34:28.275
Dad.

01:34:38.554 --> 01:34:41.354
- That's a caveman.
- that he does such a thing?

01:34:54.611 --> 01:34:56.071
Call the emergency number.

01:35:23.223 --> 01:35:26.483
- Yes.
- Sara, is he ... Is he with you?

01:35:26.518 --> 01:35:28.518
Did you see H im?
- No and you?

01:35:28.562 --> 01:35:32.442
No, he was just here.
It must be close.

01:35:32.482 --> 01:35:35.782
- Why? What happened?
- He attacked Julian.

01:35:35.819 --> 01:35:38.819
What? No, I can't believe that.

01:35:39.489 --> 01:35:40.909
I think he'll be fine,

01:35:40.949 --> 01:35:44.659
- but I'm going to the hospital with him.
- It must be Julian's fault.

01:35:44.703 --> 01:35:49.043
Listen, the police are looking for him.
Just call me as soon as you see him, okay?

01:35:49.082 --> 01:35:50.860
I just don't want him to get hurt.

01:35:51.084 --> 01:35:52.484
I will do.

01:35:55.172 --> 01:35:56.672
- Ho, ho
- Damn.

01:35:59.051 --> 01:36:00.091
What is going on?

01:36:00.135 --> 01:36:02.624
Sorry, madam,
cars may not continue after this point.
