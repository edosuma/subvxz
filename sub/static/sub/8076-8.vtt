00:03.837 --> 00:06.707
[theme music]

00:11.779 --> 00:13.881
I don't know what
to do about Astrid.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.484
She keeps bringing
home stray people.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.651
Well, then,
Mother, why don't you

00:17.685 --> 00:19.787
just have her committed again?

00:19.820 --> 00:24.192
Just for a few weeks,
like last time.

00:24.225 --> 00:27.395
Ah, I hate to spend the money.

00:27.428 --> 00:30.064
Mother, it's me, your Astrid.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.299
I'm home!

00:31.332 --> 00:32.233
Oh my goodness.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.469
Oh, darling, I missed you so!

00:35.503 --> 00:37.205
And look what I've
brought, Conners.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.038
Ohh!

00:43.544 --> 00:46.947
I met and Roseanne and Jackie
at the spa, fell in love.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.082
They're so fresh.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.050
Met them again in New
York, even fresher.

00:50.084 --> 00:50.984
And I've brought them here.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.086
Ha.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.889
Yeah, this is Andy,
DJ, Bev, Jerry, Mark,

00:55.923 --> 00:58.326
Becky, Jackie, and Roseanne.

00:58.359 --> 01:03.297
And this is Kiki, Lily,
Chip, Doris, Astrid, and--

01:03.331 --> 01:05.566
where's my Porcelain?

01:05.599 --> 01:08.302
You know I like to have my
Porcelain here when I get home.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.204
Is Porcelain somebody's name?

01:10.238 --> 01:12.106
Yes, it's Astrid's son.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.874
Whether it's a
name is debatable,

01:13.907 --> 01:17.145
but it's what she chose.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.247
Now, Mommy, I know I'm
not your precious Chippy,

01:19.280 --> 01:21.615
but couldn't you at
least pretend to like me?

01:21.649 --> 01:24.017
Oh, darling, don't
be so oversensitive.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.820
You know I love all
my children the same.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.956
Well, just because I was
the one on the boat with Daddy

01:28.989 --> 01:31.425
when he died does not mean
I'm responsible for his death.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.993
DORIS: No, of
course not, darling.

01:33.026 --> 01:37.598
Daddy just fell
off all by himself.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.301
Man, I'm starving.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.535
Oh, forgive me.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.372
That we're-- that's
so rude of us.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.906
Won't you join us?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.676
The eggs benedict are
absolutely divine!

01:48.709 --> 01:50.611
And if you don't favor
eggs, Cook can prepare

01:50.644 --> 01:51.879
almost anything you'd like.

01:51.912 --> 01:52.780
No, that's OK.

01:52.813 --> 01:53.914
We'll just eat what's out.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.849
Wouldn't you like to change?

01:55.883 --> 01:56.750
Why?

01:56.784 --> 01:57.751
All we're gonna do is eat.

01:57.785 --> 02:02.156
But you're in
your travel clothes.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.792
Oh, we really don't mind
eating in our travel clothes.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.728
I mean, sometimes we
even sleep in 'em.

02:07.761 --> 02:11.732
Um, darling, do show your
friends up to their room

02:11.765 --> 02:13.100
so they can freshen up.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.003
Werner, set a few more
places at the table, please.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.005
What if I just want
to grab a sausage?

02:18.038 --> 02:18.906
Do I have to change for that?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.679
You see, we change our clothes
for each unit of the day--

02:25.713 --> 02:28.449
morning, breakfast, morning
activities, lunch, nap,

02:28.482 --> 02:30.618
cocktails, dinner,
and after dinner.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.686
You change your clothes
eight times a day?

02:32.720 --> 02:33.721
On average.

02:40.428 --> 02:44.998
But we don't have eight
changes of clothes total.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.535
We're never gonna fit in here!

02:47.568 --> 02:48.836
I watch that Martha Steward.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.471
We'll be fine.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.274
[theme music]

02:53.307 --> 02:57.711
What doesn't kill us
is making us stronger.

02:57.745 --> 03:01.682
We're gonna last longer than
the greatest wall in China

03:01.715 --> 03:05.653
or that rabbit with a drum.

03:05.686 --> 03:10.123
If there's one
thing that I learned

03:10.157 --> 03:13.827
while waiting for my
turn is that in each life

03:13.861 --> 03:15.062
some rain falls.

03:15.095 --> 03:18.566
But you also get some sun.

03:18.599 --> 03:22.503
And we'll make out
better than OK, hey.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.506
Hear what I say.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.408
Yeah, any day.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.318
[laughs]

03:45.359 --> 03:46.760
[ball clinking]

03:48.829 --> 03:50.731
[ball clinking]

03:52.300 --> 03:53.867
Is everyone comfy?

03:53.901 --> 03:56.370
Would anyone like a sweater?
- Oh, no, thanks.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.338
We're all fine.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.606
All right.

03:58.639 --> 04:02.510
They all changed
their clothes again.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.613
I've asked Werner to put out
some extra clothes for them.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.349
Yes, the primary colors, the
hallmark of the working class.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.520
Hello, fellows!

04:12.553 --> 04:13.487
Hey, Chip.

04:13.521 --> 04:14.455
Ow!

04:14.488 --> 04:15.889
I got you!

04:15.923 --> 04:18.091
Mark, DJ, I'd like you
to meet Flip and Skip.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.632
Chip, Flip, and Skip?

04:24.665 --> 04:28.135
You've gotta be hosin' me.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.404
Oh, we've taken that
ribbing before, hey, fellows.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.305
Have we?

04:31.339 --> 04:32.506
[laughter]

04:32.540 --> 04:34.508
Of course, at Choate, we
always gave the business

04:34.542 --> 04:36.076
to Ray, Tray, and Gray.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.378
[laughter]

04:38.412 --> 04:40.848
CHIP: So, we were
hoping maybe you

04:40.881 --> 04:43.751
boys would like to join us for
a little game of touch football.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.085
Sounds cool.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.822
OK, we're not changing
clothes between quarters.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.458
Would anyone like a drink?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.893
We've got screwdrivers,
mimosas, Bloody Marys,

04:52.926 --> 04:55.162
Tom Collins, boilermaker.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.964
Astrid, it's 10:30
in the morning!

04:56.997 --> 04:58.031
ASTRID: I know.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.233
My daughter is a
child of the modern age.

05:00.267 --> 05:05.238
In my day, we had our
first drink at 10:15 sharp!

05:05.272 --> 05:09.577
Beverly, you look
like a mimosa girl.

05:09.610 --> 05:14.181
Oh, Doris, it's like
you've known me all my life.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.949
Well, anyone can
tell that you're

05:15.983 --> 05:17.918
a woman of taste and breeding.

05:17.951 --> 05:21.689
Yeah, anybody that started
drinking at 10:00 AM.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.691
CHIP: Look, Mother,
I'm going to score!

05:27.395 --> 05:29.430
I say!

05:29.463 --> 05:30.964
This is a game of
touch football.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.165
Yeah, I'm begging your pardon.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.337
So, Astrid,
where's your husband?

05:37.371 --> 05:40.474
Well, he went to visit his
mother in a mental institution.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.276
That's where my
husband is too.

05:43.310 --> 05:47.848
We really have
moved up in class.

05:47.881 --> 05:51.251
There we go, sugar.

05:51.284 --> 05:55.222
Are you still breathing?

05:55.255 --> 05:58.392
I forgot my mirror.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.460
All right, all right.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.360
That is it.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.329
Andy, now, you knocked that off.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.531
I told you before.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.766
You do not throw things
at the nice rich lady.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.936
Stop that.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.472
Hello, how are you?

06:11.505 --> 06:12.305
Hello!

06:16.109 --> 06:19.246
I'm afraid Grandmama is
a little hard of hearing.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.848
Oh.

06:20.881 --> 06:25.252
(YELLING) I'm
having a lovely time!

06:25.285 --> 06:28.155
Your house is simply marvelous!

06:28.188 --> 06:31.592
I have dreamed all
my life of living

06:31.625 --> 06:33.461
in a house just like this!

06:36.997 --> 06:38.365
Nice catch, DJ.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.567
Thanks.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.903
Women and football
don't mix, old sport.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.438
DJ, why don't
you take a break,

06:44.472 --> 06:45.806
and I'll give you a
tour of the house.

06:45.839 --> 06:46.707
OK.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.476
JACKIE: All right.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.010
OK.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.278
Hey.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.814
Filling in for DJ Conner,
number 32 in your program

06:53.847 --> 06:56.950
is number one in your
heart is Jackie Harris!

06:56.984 --> 06:57.885
All right.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.520
Go get get 'em Jackie!

06:59.553 --> 07:01.789
Hey, Becky, Conner women
are not just cheerleaders.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.724
Get out of here.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.725
Both of yas.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.126
Now you guys are toast!

07:08.662 --> 07:09.830
Ah.

07:09.863 --> 07:14.434
To my dear departed
husband, Reginald Wentworth.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.003
To Daddy.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.738
What a life, man.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.974
You guys just sit around,
drink until you get gout,

07:21.008 --> 07:23.711
and then-- and then
your servant carts

07:23.744 --> 07:27.314
you around in a wheelchair.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.216
Yes, but to break
up the busy day,

07:29.249 --> 07:31.318
I thought we might bring the
children out to amuse us.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.890
ASTRID: There's my little
Porcelain, come to me.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.659
JACKIE: Andy, hey
Andy, look at here.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.461
Mommy's playing football,
ha, and Mommy's kicking butt!

07:44.532 --> 07:45.899
Oh, hello, Jerry.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.768
Did you like your nap?

07:47.801 --> 07:52.339
How did that 100% pure
Egyptian cotton treat ya, huh?

07:52.372 --> 07:54.074
Would you like to
play ball, Porcelain?

07:54.107 --> 07:54.975
Yeah.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.410
He would.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.112
Go over.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.582
Look how wonderful he is.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.482
No!

08:02.516 --> 08:03.383
Don't go after it.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.451
Don't go off the porch.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.352
Come to Mommy.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.186
Are you hurt?

08:11.358 --> 08:12.760
Oh!

08:12.793 --> 08:14.394
Such a violent game.

08:14.427 --> 08:15.863
Go chip, go!

08:15.896 --> 08:17.264
JACKIE: I'm gonna get him!

08:20.768 --> 08:22.670
Woo!

08:22.703 --> 08:25.038
[growls]

08:31.979 --> 08:34.414
Geez, this kitchen is huge.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.349
You could have like a
whole party in here.

08:36.383 --> 08:39.019
Oh yeah, you can do a
lot of things in here.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.958
You've got great hair.

08:44.992 --> 08:45.959
Thanks.

08:45.993 --> 08:46.794
Can I have some pretzels?

08:50.330 --> 08:53.533
You're one of those
bad boys, aren't you?

08:53.567 --> 08:56.369
What'd I do?

08:56.403 --> 08:57.270
Nothing.

08:57.304 --> 09:00.373
But I know what you want to do.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.242
- You do?
- Sure.

09:02.275 --> 09:07.881
I know about guys like you,
guys from public schools,

09:07.915 --> 09:11.418
with your torn jeans
and sweaty t-shirts.

09:11.451 --> 09:15.422
You like to stay out late at
night, rip antennas off cars,

09:15.455 --> 09:16.924
steal.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.760
And spit.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.062
Well, I did take my
parents' car once, but--

09:22.095 --> 09:23.196
I knew it!

09:23.230 --> 09:26.900
I bet you have
African-American friends too.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.268
Yeah, don't you?

09:28.301 --> 09:31.438
Ugh, DJ, I've
always wanted to do

09:31.471 --> 09:32.472
it with a boy from the streets.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.344
This isn't your
first time, is it?

09:37.377 --> 09:38.779
Yes, I mean no, I mean I--

09:38.812 --> 09:41.114
I've been with
lots of women, just

09:41.148 --> 09:44.852
not here in the "vine yard."

09:44.885 --> 09:46.687
Most of them have been
mall chicks and waitresses.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.137
Shouldn't you two
be wearing sweaters?

10:16.383 --> 10:17.584
Slow down, guys.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.854
You don't want to ruin your
appetite before dinner.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.123
But I thought this was dinner.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.659
No, Mark, it's an
appetizer, like that thing

10:25.693 --> 10:29.930
they put in the upper right
hand corner of the TV dinner.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.099
Hey, where are
all the Wentworths?

10:32.132 --> 10:35.803
Oh, they're upstairs,
changing again.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.304
Sitting here in
the lap of luxury,

10:37.337 --> 10:39.973
I just can't help thinking about
the poor, starving children

10:40.007 --> 10:41.041
of the world.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.442
I really don't think
I've been doing all

10:42.475 --> 10:44.745
I can for the great unwashed.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.514
So the next time I'm
at the dry cleaners,

10:47.547 --> 10:51.752
I'm dropping an extra quarter
in the Sally Struthers can.

10:51.785 --> 10:55.255
JACKIE: Oh man, look at this!

10:55.288 --> 10:58.158
Oh, wow, I think we
found Doris's stash.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.895
Demerol, Valium, Prozac.

11:01.929 --> 11:05.933
Wow, Xanax, Percocet, Lithium.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.468
This chick is looped!

11:08.501 --> 11:12.906
Oh, look, this one here
is just plain old aspirin.

11:12.940 --> 11:17.878
I'll borrow it in case
I get a headache later.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.780
What do you think this is for?

11:19.813 --> 11:21.614
[buzz]

11:22.649 --> 11:23.683
Hey!

11:23.717 --> 11:24.584
Look at that!

11:24.617 --> 11:25.786
You made a butler appear.

11:25.819 --> 11:29.056
And he's-- he's bearing gifts!

11:29.089 --> 11:32.425
You really liven up
a poor butler's life.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.994
You know, it must
suck having a job

11:34.027 --> 11:37.130
with the word "butt" in it.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.966
Hey, take a load
off here, Werner.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.500
We want to buy you a drink.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.269
Oh, no, no, no,
wouldn't be proper--

11:42.302 --> 11:44.637
too many rules around here.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.173
[laughter]

11:47.340 --> 11:49.777
And as grand dame
of the Conner family,

11:49.810 --> 11:52.345
let me just remind you,
I simply cannot have you

11:52.379 --> 11:55.115
laughing in your dining attire!

11:55.148 --> 11:56.449
[laughter]

11:57.450 --> 11:59.219
[clears throat]

12:00.420 --> 12:02.655
Really?

12:02.689 --> 12:04.657
Uh, Werner, would you tell Cook
that we're ready for dinner?

12:04.691 --> 12:05.592
Thank you.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.209
Man, look at this.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.144
Three forks, four plates.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.146
I don't know how many glasses.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.515
I know, there are many
things on the table,

12:28.548 --> 12:29.783
I don't even know
where I put my elbows.

12:33.386 --> 12:40.327
So, Roseanne, what do
people in the Midwest do?

12:40.360 --> 12:44.297
You know, raise families,
farm, just regular stuff,

12:44.331 --> 12:45.665
like, you know, work at jobs.

12:45.698 --> 12:46.733
Hmm.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.136
You lost me.

12:49.169 --> 12:53.606
Uh, Doris, could you please
pass me the bread there, if it

12:53.640 --> 12:56.143
isn't a bother or anything.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.145
Bread is never a
bother, dear, not

12:58.178 --> 12:59.980
when it's baked, not
when it's sliced,

13:00.013 --> 13:02.249
and not when it's served.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.817
Oh, I-- I know.

13:03.851 --> 13:04.684
I was just--

13:08.488 --> 13:10.190
Excuse me, Astrid?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.692
I don't mean to be
rude, but who's that?

13:12.725 --> 13:14.094
You missed the introductions.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.230
This is Dr. Harun Devi Bakshi
of the University of Calcutta.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.065
Hello.

13:21.368 --> 13:25.072
So, Dr. Bakshi,
there, what brings

13:25.105 --> 13:27.174
you to the good old US of A?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.675
I'm doing a fellowship
at the Kennedy

13:28.708 --> 13:31.011
School of Government in Boston.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.780
Oh, well, that
sounds like fun.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.616
I get a kick out of it.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.952
What I'm finding, however,
is that the American views

13:38.986 --> 13:42.222
on foreign policy are at
the very least cloistered.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.824
No, I totally disagree.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.227
I think the cliche of
the cloistered American

13:47.260 --> 13:48.996
is an anachronism.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.431
Did you say India or Indiana?

13:55.235 --> 13:56.603
India.

13:56.636 --> 13:57.504
India.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.638
Oh.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.874
Yeah, I-- I didn't ever
see that Gandhi movie.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.843
But was it "Gandhi" II
or III where he gets

14:03.877 --> 14:05.212
in that big fight with Mr. T?

14:08.548 --> 14:09.749
Oh, anyway.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.552
Hey, what's the deal
with the Untouchables?

14:12.585 --> 14:15.055
In our country, we
have a caste system.

14:15.088 --> 14:18.091
The Untouchables are
on the lowest rung.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.226
They are less than us.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.694
Their lives are a drudgery.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.730
They get the most
undesirable jobs.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.032
Oh.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.199
Yeah, we have that here.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.467
We just call them
illegal aliens.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.008
Nobody else is talking to him.

14:40.948 --> 14:41.814
OK.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.116
Listen.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.517
Can I just say something?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.753
You know, before dinner when you
came out there, and you saw us,

14:46.786 --> 14:48.855
and we were kind of making
a joke at the expense

14:48.888 --> 14:50.423
of your family,
well, we would really

14:50.457 --> 14:54.194
like to say that we're sorry and
we didn't mean to offend you.

14:54.227 --> 14:59.933
Yes, well, thank you
for your words, Roseanne.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.335
A brilliant
[inaudible],, eh, Chippy?

15:02.369 --> 15:03.870
[speaking french]

15:04.938 --> 15:06.006
No, really, I just
want you to know

15:06.039 --> 15:07.975
that we're very, very sorry.

15:08.008 --> 15:11.244
Roseanne, we've thanked
you for your words,

15:11.278 --> 15:12.379
and that was the end of it.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.892
Well, can we turn a light on?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.161
No, these people
are like moths.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.563
They'll be down
here in a second.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.965
Think they're still mad at us?

15:31.999 --> 15:34.434
I think we'd have to
'em open to find out.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.137
God, they've got
rules for everything!

15:37.170 --> 15:39.906
Rules for what to wear,
rules for how to eat,

15:39.939 --> 15:42.075
rules for how to sit.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.543
Uh-oh.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.278
Oh, it's you.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.915
I thought maybe the
help was stealing again.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.750
Well, since I'm here, I'm
going to get a little bicarb.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.419
I've got indigestion.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.454
Well, that's an
understandable.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.758
Oh, it's you.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.493
I thought it was Daddy.

16:00.527 --> 16:04.197
I thought I saw Daddy's ghost.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.765
(MOCKING) Daddy's
ghost stole my pan.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.200
He broke my glass unicorn.

16:07.234 --> 16:10.470
I am sick to death
of Daddy's ghost!

16:10.503 --> 16:12.805
Maybe Daddy broke the
horn off the unicorn

16:12.839 --> 16:14.241
so it would feel like
the other horses.

16:17.777 --> 16:21.181
So it wouldn't
feel so different!

16:21.214 --> 16:23.016
Oh, Daddy, I love you!

16:23.050 --> 16:25.985
I miss you so!

16:26.019 --> 16:29.422
Well, hey, let's all
make some sandwiches.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.890
I'm not hungry.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.693
Come on, Doris, you hardly
ate anything at dinner.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.362
I'm-- I'm fine, really.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.830
I mean, really, you only had
like, what, a couple of peas?

16:37.864 --> 16:39.966
And who's to say you
kept any of that down?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.501
I said I'm not hungry.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.835
Mother, it's all right.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.104
There's nothing wrong
with coming down

16:44.137 --> 16:45.405
to the kitchen for a sandwich.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.474
But it's not why I came here.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.243
Take the damn sandwich!

16:50.277 --> 16:51.578
My!

16:51.611 --> 16:53.380
Did you just yell at me?

16:53.413 --> 16:55.248
You bet your ass I did.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.849
Now take the damn sandwich.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.685
How could you speak
to me like that?

16:58.718 --> 17:01.588
Oh, who are you to be
putting on those airs?

17:01.621 --> 17:03.923
We all know what the
family was built on--

17:03.956 --> 17:06.459
bootlegging, gambling, bimbos.

17:08.895 --> 17:09.896
God, that felt good.

17:09.929 --> 17:13.100
I-- I've kept that
inside for 80 years.

17:13.133 --> 17:17.237
Lucky for you, my
teeth didn't fly out.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.507
This is just what
all of you people need.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.342
What in heaven's name
is she talking about?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.376
You need to get mad!

17:23.410 --> 17:24.277
You need to yell.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.678
Let it out.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.116
Then you won't need to drink so
much or to start foreign wars.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.283
We don't start wars.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.119
We just profit from them.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.853
Oh, we start some.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.256
Now listen to what
this lady has to say.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.924
Roseanne, teach her.

17:37.957 --> 17:41.094
Doris Wentworth, I'm going
to tutor you in the fine art

17:41.128 --> 17:42.629
of female anger.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.697
No, I-- I don't think so.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.633
Well, I'm sure with
your proper upbringing

17:46.666 --> 17:51.571
you realize that it is rude to
refuse a request of a guest.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.541
She's got you there, Mumsie.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.276
I'll give you one minute.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.244
Great.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.846
Well, let's start
by loosening up.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.481
Unclasp those arms, Doris.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.583
Take the pole out.
Come on.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.752
Put your legs apart, Doris.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.355
And plant them firmly, because
once you start yelling,

18:08.388 --> 18:10.490
you might find
yourself off balance.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.458
How do you feel?

18:11.491 --> 18:13.660
A tad wrong.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.562
Good, now repeat after me.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.765
I'm not taking any
crap from anyone!

18:18.798 --> 18:19.799
I am not--

18:19.832 --> 18:20.700
Stop!

18:20.733 --> 18:21.668
It is not "I am."

18:21.701 --> 18:23.970
It's "I'm"!

18:24.003 --> 18:26.673
I'm not taking any--

18:26.706 --> 18:28.040
do I have to say the C word?

18:28.074 --> 18:29.376
Yes, you do, Doris.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.077
You have to say it, because
it's the most important word

18:31.110 --> 18:32.179
in the whole damn sentence.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.146
Trust her, Doris.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.148
She's very good at this.

18:35.182 --> 18:38.485
I'm not taking any
crap from anyone.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.386
That was pretty good.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.621
But are you serving tea, Doris?

18:41.654 --> 18:43.723
You've got to make it
shrill and grating.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.892
I'm not taking any
crap from anyone!

18:45.925 --> 18:49.496
You know, like fingernails
on a chalkboard.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.831
I'm not taking any
crap from anyone!

18:54.801 --> 18:56.203
Good!

18:56.236 --> 18:57.103
Now personalize it.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.071
Make it your own!

18:59.105 --> 19:02.041
I'm not taking out a
damn crap from anyone,

19:02.074 --> 19:04.277
you hear that, Astrid?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.778
Bravo, Mama.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.680
How do you feel?

19:07.714 --> 19:12.219
I feel fan-freaking-tastic!

19:12.252 --> 19:13.152
[laughs]

19:14.153 --> 19:15.522
Oh, that's good.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.790
See, now you won't need to
take those pills anymore.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.825
I won't?

19:18.858 --> 19:21.428
No, women who yell
don't need pills.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.831
Men invented pills
to shut women up!

19:24.864 --> 19:26.666
[laughs]

19:27.700 --> 19:28.635
I'm ashamed to be a man!

19:28.668 --> 19:31.204
DORIS: That's the
spirit, Chippy!

19:31.238 --> 19:32.539
I want to yell too!

19:32.572 --> 19:33.373
Yoohoo!

19:35.708 --> 19:37.344
It does feel good.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.380
Now, something here tells me
that that's not the first time

19:40.413 --> 19:41.714
you've done that, Astrid.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.850
She's a little too
good to be a beginner.

19:43.883 --> 19:44.917
No, no, no, no.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.219
That's the first time
I've ever done it.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.354
I swear.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.588
Roseanne, I think we've
got ourselves a natural.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.622
All right.

19:49.656 --> 19:50.823
Practice makes perfect.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.760
Give it to me again,
baby, right in the face.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.161
I said no, Daddy!

20:00.600 --> 20:03.670
I believe our
work here is done.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.105
I am absolutely famished.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.540
I'm hungry too!

20:07.574 --> 20:08.975
Yelling makes you hungry.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.910
Wait till you see how
much you can eat after you

20:10.943 --> 20:12.445
start breaking things.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.313
[laughter]

20:13.346 --> 20:15.848
May I make a suggestion?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.116
Stella.

20:17.149 --> 20:17.950
My god, the help!

20:21.388 --> 20:26.359
Roseanne, you're good, but
there's something missing.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.460
Do tell.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.862
See, you've got to
put some bottom into it.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.298
See, give it some body language.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.032
- Mhm.
- You know, get that hip going.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.033
Mhm.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.435
OK, and then get
that head going.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.603
- Mhm.
- That's it.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.170
That's it.
Now give him the hand.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.008
That's it.

20:42.041 --> 20:45.845
And then you tell
him, get out my face!

20:45.878 --> 20:49.449
'Cause Stella don't take that!

20:49.482 --> 20:55.254
You better check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.222
JACKIE: Stella!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.024
Stella!
Stella!

20:58.057 --> 20:58.958
ALL: Go Stella!

20:58.991 --> 21:00.192
Go Stella!

21:00.226 --> 21:01.193
Go Stella!

21:01.227 --> 21:02.662
GRANDMAMA LILY: Stella!
