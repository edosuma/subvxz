00:08.660 --> 00:11.533
Previously
onStar Trek: Picard...

00:11.576 --> 00:14.014
SOJI: All the disordered
are Romulans.

00:14.057 --> 00:17.234
The only Romulans ever
assimilated, as far as I know.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.499
Hugh?Welcome.

00:21.543 --> 00:22.674
I'm looking for someone.

00:22.718 --> 00:26.548
Dr. Soji Asha.Can you take me to her now?

00:26.591 --> 00:30.813
I believe she's close to
discovering who she really is.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.336
SOJI: I had the dream again
last night.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.773
NAREK: If I can get her
to tell me about her dreams,

00:34.817 --> 00:37.472
the information is all in there.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.082
Including the location
of their homeworld.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.041
I'm pushing the door now.
I'm stepping inside.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.914
NAREK:
What do you see?

00:44.957 --> 00:47.395
SOJI: I see two red moons,
dark as blood,

00:47.438 --> 00:49.701
and-and lightning,
so much lightning.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.399
Well done, little brother.

00:51.442 --> 00:52.617
You found home.

00:52.661 --> 00:55.055
Narek!

00:55.098 --> 00:57.057
She's been activated.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.762
Soji?

01:06.805 --> 01:09.460
Do you know what's
happening to me?I do. Come.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.506
They are in some
serious trouble.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.595
PICARD: This thing can take us
to a safer place.

01:13.638 --> 01:16.250
A spatial trajector.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.773
We have to go now.

01:17.816 --> 01:20.645
Let's set a rendezvous.Rendezvous? Where are you going?

01:20.689 --> 01:22.343
Nepenthe. Meet us there.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.996
Where's the kid?

01:25.737 --> 01:28.697
Elnor, I told you
to stay on the ship.

01:28.740 --> 01:31.003
I'll stay behind to cover
your escape.Come.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.094
Trust me.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.691
Oh.

02:06.735 --> 02:09.433
Hi.

02:09.477 --> 02:12.654
Dr. Jurati. Commodore Oh.

02:12.697 --> 02:15.178
Director of
Starfleet Security.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.180
I'd like to talk to you
about your two recent visits

02:17.224 --> 02:18.399
with Admiral Picard.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.967
Def-Definitely. Sure.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.360
During your
first meeting,

02:23.404 --> 02:25.362
you discussed
his belief

02:25.406 --> 02:28.365
that he interacted
with a synthetic life-form.

02:28.409 --> 02:31.020
The work and whereabouts
of Dr. Bruce Maddox

02:31.063 --> 02:32.891
and fractal neuronic cloning.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.415
You have me under surveillance?

02:34.458 --> 02:35.894
Following that meeting,
you transferred

02:35.938 --> 02:39.071
300 gigabytes of material
relevant to Dr. Maddox

02:39.115 --> 02:41.378
to your personal access
display device.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.075
Data which,
presumably,

02:43.119 --> 02:46.557
you provided the admiral in the
course of your second meeting,

02:46.601 --> 02:48.429
at his residence
in La Barre, France.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.346
I take your silence
to be confirmation.

02:52.389 --> 02:55.218
What else did you and he
discuss the second time?

02:55.262 --> 02:57.699
Um...

02:57.742 --> 02:59.918
the works of Asimov.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.968
I told him I was sorry.Oh?

03:06.011 --> 03:07.883
What for?

03:07.926 --> 03:11.495
Not sorry for,
sorry that.

03:11.539 --> 03:15.064
Sorry that I didn't
get a chance to meet...

03:17.109 --> 03:19.547
...the synthetic life-form.

03:19.590 --> 03:23.899
That would've been the
culmination of a lifelong dream.

03:25.466 --> 03:27.250
I'm sorry, am I in trouble?

03:27.294 --> 03:28.773
Not at all.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.385
I'm here because
we need your help.

03:31.428 --> 03:34.301
Admiral Picard
notified Starfleet

03:34.344 --> 03:36.303
that he intends
to travel off-world

03:36.346 --> 03:40.307
in search of Bruce Maddox and a
functioning synthetic life-form.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.526
We'd like you to accompany him.

03:42.570 --> 03:47.009
Off-world?
I've never...

03:47.052 --> 03:49.229
If it's just my expertise
you need, maybe...

03:49.272 --> 03:52.449
We need far more than just
your expertise, I'm afraid.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.408
Let me show you
what will happen

03:54.451 --> 03:57.062
if synthetic life
is allowed to exist.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.764
O-Okay, but...My mind

04:02.807 --> 04:04.940
to your mind.

04:04.983 --> 04:08.248
My thoughts to your thoughts.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.386
Ah!

04:34.883 --> 04:36.580
What do you need me to do?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.410
First, take this.

04:43.892 --> 04:47.243
It will allow us
to track you.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.377
It must be chewed.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.776
What I'm going
to ask you to do

04:58.820 --> 05:02.171
will require
terrible sacrifice.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.094
RIOS: Get us back online, Raffi.I'm trying, I'm trying.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.488
The tractor beam has completely
scrambled our systems.

05:14.531 --> 05:17.229
Well, try harder,
goddamn it.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.449
I blame you for this.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.016
Me? How is this my fault?

05:21.059 --> 05:23.410
"Chris, baby, he's an old man,
how far is he gonna get?"

05:23.453 --> 05:25.760
Now Picard's en route
to a planet that's days away

05:25.803 --> 05:28.023
at maximum warp.
Don't ask me how.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.417
And I'm tractor-locked
to a Borg cube full of Romulans.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.856
Ah, damn it.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.685
Can't you hack the
traffic control system?

05:37.728 --> 05:39.774
Raffi!I'm trying.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.777
The underlying code's all
freaky Borg machine language.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.822
Just ask them to let us go.

05:44.866 --> 05:49.131
They don't want us,
they want her.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.220
I mean, wherever
Picard took her,

05:51.263 --> 05:53.222
they'll hunt her down
and destroy her.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.919
Just tell them
we want to go home.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.802
NARISSA: Where have you hidden
Picard and the synth?

06:12.502 --> 06:14.939
I said tell me
where I can find

06:14.983 --> 06:18.987
Picard and your
little protégé.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.293
We know you led them
into Subsector 11,

06:21.337 --> 06:23.208
and that only you
returned.

06:23.252 --> 06:26.168
The bodies of four heavily armed
guards were afterward found

06:26.211 --> 06:28.213
in Subsector 11,
and that will definitely be

06:28.257 --> 06:31.042
my second question,
but for now,

06:31.086 --> 06:32.435
please answer the first.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.698
They're gone.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.265
And what was
their destination?

06:36.308 --> 06:38.354
I strongly advise you

06:38.398 --> 06:40.835
to not say
you don't know.

06:48.756 --> 06:49.974
I'm bored.

07:20.265 --> 07:23.791
I hate this vile cube.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.836
It's obscene.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.361
As are you and your...

07:29.405 --> 07:31.320
"xBs,"

07:31.363 --> 07:34.366
but that isn't why
these things died.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.545
They died
because of you.

07:42.026 --> 07:45.856
Because you helped Picard
and the synthetic escape.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.685
Because you ruined

07:48.729 --> 07:51.993
years of patient work
by dozens of operatives

07:52.036 --> 07:54.778
across hundreds
of star systems.

07:54.822 --> 07:57.346
Because you
may have doomed

07:57.389 --> 08:01.524
a trillion souls
across half the galaxy.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.180
I would kill you, too,

08:05.223 --> 08:07.748
but you're Federation,

08:07.791 --> 08:10.577
and you're protected
by that asinine treaty.

08:17.453 --> 08:18.585
Are you ready?

08:18.628 --> 08:21.022
Leaving now.

08:21.065 --> 08:23.677
Signal lock's strong.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.553
NARISSA:
Then I'll let our guests go.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.643
COMPUTER VOICE:
Systems back online.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.211
Ship stabilizer is reactivated.
Engine status...

08:37.604 --> 08:39.997
You did it!
Wasn't me.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.651
That has to be a trick.

08:41.695 --> 08:45.176
Maybe.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.657
They still have to catch me.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.535
What about Elnor?

09:06.981 --> 09:10.419
Your friends,
they're worried.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.990
RIOS :
Hey, Mano, it's time to go.

09:16.033 --> 09:19.559
Go without me.
This will not happen again.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.517
My help is needed here.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.914
Everybody here
thinks you're crazy.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.916
And brave.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.789
And brave.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.147
Adios, kid.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.366
You might want

12:38.409 --> 12:40.585
to point that thing
at my head, uh...

12:40.629 --> 12:43.545
My heart is solid duritanium.

12:45.373 --> 12:48.202
You said this was
a safe place.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.726
Are we safe here, Kestra?

12:57.037 --> 12:58.778
Your mum and dad about?

13:01.476 --> 13:03.521
Is he your grandpa?

13:03.565 --> 13:05.523
No.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.047
Your dad?

13:07.090 --> 13:09.919
I don't know him
at all.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.226
He told me
he was a friend

13:12.269 --> 13:15.533
of the man he called
my father.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.275
But you don't
believe him?

13:18.319 --> 13:20.364
I don't believe
anyone.

13:22.410 --> 13:25.282
What's that?It's called a compass.

13:25.326 --> 13:27.719
It finds north.
I got it from my friend

13:27.763 --> 13:30.200
Captain Crandall
over in Infinity Lake.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.333
He's even older
than Picard.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.857
So...

13:34.901 --> 13:36.946
do you believe me?

13:36.990 --> 13:39.209
Have you told me any lies yet?

13:39.253 --> 13:43.039
Well, kind of. I mean,
this is just a costume.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.563
It's, like...
like a game

13:45.607 --> 13:47.217
my brother made up.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.872
Yeah, I'm not really
a Viveen, Wild Girl

13:49.916 --> 13:52.832
of the Woods.You had me fooled.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.181
My arrows are real, though.

13:54.224 --> 13:57.314
But I would never shoot you
because I'm a pacifist,

13:57.358 --> 13:59.316
but I could.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.015
I'll keep that
in mind.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.713
Also, this compass
is broken.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.586
Who was her father?

14:08.630 --> 14:11.285
Well, I...

14:11.328 --> 14:14.636
I imagine that you've heard of
Commander Data.

14:14.679 --> 14:18.248
Whoa, you're an android?

14:20.685 --> 14:22.470
Soji.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.385
No. It's-it's
all right.

14:24.428 --> 14:27.170
No-no.
Easy, easy.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.303
I know it must be
very hard.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.220
Everything you believed in,

14:33.263 --> 14:35.744
your memories,
your identity...

14:35.787 --> 14:39.226
My dreams, my body,
my parents, my sister,

14:39.269 --> 14:42.272
all of it was fake.No, no, not Dahj.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.926
No, Dahj was real.

14:48.322 --> 14:51.934
I am so sorry.

14:53.414 --> 14:56.634
Your sister is dead.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.902
She was murdered

15:02.945 --> 15:05.252
by those people
who nearly killed you.

15:07.297 --> 15:10.257
Whatever.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.520
None of this is real.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.436
Just get on with the mind game.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.320
Mom! Dad!

15:34.281 --> 15:36.674
So, who are these people?

15:36.718 --> 15:39.895
We were...

15:39.939 --> 15:42.942
They're old friends.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.033
Come on.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.574
KESTRA:
Mom!

16:26.724 --> 16:28.552
Mmm...

16:34.558 --> 16:36.821
You're in trouble.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.258
How bad?

16:39.302 --> 16:41.000
Bad enough.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.400
I'm fine.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.491
I'm fine.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.928
Really.

16:56.972 --> 17:01.759
And I am very, very glad
to see your face.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.243
Welcome...

17:09.376 --> 17:12.988
This is Commander
Deanna Troi.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.381
Dr. Soji Asha.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.774
Just Soji.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.213
Long story.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.350
KESTRA :
Dad!

17:27.394 --> 17:29.178
What?KESTRA:
Come out here!

17:29.222 --> 17:32.834
Stop yelling!It's Jean-Luc Picard!

17:36.403 --> 17:37.926
Pause music.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.843
Say again?

17:41.886 --> 17:43.062
PICARD:
Hello, Will.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.155
Ah... Oh, man.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.982
Ah.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.120
Oh...

17:58.164 --> 18:00.644
You need a place to hide out?

18:00.688 --> 18:02.385
Shields up.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.387
Perimeter scans to max.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.563
We've had a little trouble
around here lately

18:06.607 --> 18:07.999
with the Kzinti.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.785
Best to run
anti-cloaking scans, too.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.787
Romulans?Mm-hmm.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.311
Initiate anti-cloaking scans.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.707
That time you were
flying off to Romulus,

18:19.750 --> 18:21.709
to plan the great
supernova rescue,

18:21.752 --> 18:23.145
do you remember what I said?

18:23.189 --> 18:26.670
"So you want to be ass-deep
in Romulans

18:26.714 --> 18:28.629
for the rest of your life?"I believe I also

18:28.672 --> 18:33.068
reminded you of Newton's
fourth law of thermodynamics.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.288
No good deed goes unpunished.Right.

18:35.331 --> 18:36.941
I told Kestra to show

18:36.985 --> 18:38.856
your friend how to
find the shower.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.771
Thank you.
She's a friend?

18:40.815 --> 18:42.643
Soji. She appears fully human.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.775
Her face, her voice,
her body language

18:44.819 --> 18:47.169
all express clear emotion.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.432
The poor thing
seems traumatized.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.434
But?

18:51.478 --> 18:53.567
I sense nothing.
I can't read her.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.962
I think I'm in over my head.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.791
When I left Earth,
I had a plan, I had a ship.

19:00.835 --> 19:04.360
I even had a crew, of sorts.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.188
Now I've lost them all.

19:06.232 --> 19:10.366
My plan turns out to be, well,

19:10.410 --> 19:15.893
half a plan at best, and the
girl's life is still in danger.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.808
Well, it sounds like
you need a new plan.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.419
Yeah.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.117
One that starts with a nap.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.511
Oh...You're exhausted.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.426
You can lie down
in Thad's room and rest

19:26.469 --> 19:28.819
while Will makes us dinner.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.126
Pizza, in the wood-fired oven.
Tomato and basil

19:31.170 --> 19:32.736
from our garden.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.956
Behold! A Wild
Girl of the Woods!

19:34.999 --> 19:36.914
Elanil sindelamin namad.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.133
Nicely done.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.917
You cut out the venom sacs?

19:39.961 --> 19:43.443
Nope, I left them in so we can
all spew black bile and die.

19:43.486 --> 19:47.360
Pizza, with tomato, basil and
nonvenomous bunnicorn sausage.

19:47.403 --> 19:51.102
Sounds wonderful. Thank you.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.018
Stay as long as you need.

19:54.062 --> 19:57.239
Whatever it is,
we can handle it.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.545
TROI:
Of course.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.155
Absolutely.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.734
Can you play
the violin?

20:13.777 --> 20:15.214
No.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.780
Do you like Sherlock Holmes?

20:16.824 --> 20:19.305
I guess so.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.916
Can you run superfast
and jump really high

20:21.959 --> 20:24.832
and, um, and bend steel
with your hands?

20:24.875 --> 20:27.661
Turns out, yes, I can.

20:27.704 --> 20:29.228
Weird.

20:29.271 --> 20:32.318
Tell me about it.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.189
KESTRA:
So, okay, you have blood.
Do you have spit?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.582
I do.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.887
Mucus?

20:36.931 --> 20:38.411
Yes, I have mucus.

20:38.454 --> 20:40.587
Data did not have mucus.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.806
You know a lot about Data.

20:42.850 --> 20:46.114
My parents served with him
in Starfleet, until he died.

20:46.157 --> 20:49.073
A long time ago, on a
ship called the Enterprise.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.771
Picard was the captain.

20:50.814 --> 20:55.558
My dad said he was the greatest
Starfleet captain ever.

20:55.602 --> 21:01.434
It seems weird to make an
android with mucus and saliva,

21:01.477 --> 21:04.872
but I guess Data
would do it like that.

21:06.743 --> 21:10.007
I don't see how this Data
could be my father.

21:10.051 --> 21:13.315
I mean, if I was...

21:13.359 --> 21:17.972
made, it was probably
about three years ago.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.019
Wait, why would Data
want to make an android

21:22.063 --> 21:24.021
with mucus and saliva?

21:24.065 --> 21:28.025
Well, he was always
trying to be more human.

21:28.069 --> 21:31.028
He could do all these-these
amazing things,

21:31.072 --> 21:34.293
but all he ever really wanted
to do was, like, have dreams

21:34.336 --> 21:39.472
and tell jokes and, like,
learn how to ballroom dance.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.609
Are you like that?

21:48.611 --> 21:50.047
Actually,

21:50.091 --> 21:53.921
until you said the word
"android" back there,

21:53.964 --> 21:57.098
I was still clinging
to the idea that I was human.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.319
Oh.

22:09.676 --> 22:10.938
A-Are you okay?

22:12.156 --> 22:13.767
No, no. D-Don't cry.

22:13.810 --> 22:16.639
I-I think you're amazing.

22:16.683 --> 22:19.773
Because I have mucus?

22:19.816 --> 22:21.992
And because
you're three years old,

22:22.036 --> 22:25.909
so I get to be the boss of you.

22:45.929 --> 22:48.105
Deanna, the language

22:48.149 --> 22:50.281
that Kestra was speaking...

22:50.325 --> 22:51.674
Viveen.

22:51.718 --> 22:56.549
Spoken by
the Wild Girls of the Woods.

22:56.592 --> 22:59.769
You know, the first time
that I met Thad,

22:59.813 --> 23:02.903
he was speaking some sort of
invented language.

23:02.946 --> 23:04.905
He couldn't have been
more than five.

23:04.948 --> 23:08.604
Hmm. That was the...

23:08.648 --> 23:10.389
second time, actually.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.608
Oh, Lord.

23:12.652 --> 23:16.003
A long time ago.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.962
Last week would have been
his 18th birthday.

23:22.183 --> 23:25.229
Oh, we're fine. Really.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.057
Kestra still aches for him,

23:27.101 --> 23:31.714
but with every day, the ache
fades a little bit more.

23:31.758 --> 23:37.590
But seeing that happen must be
a different ache for you.

23:41.681 --> 23:44.466
It's wonderful
to see you, Jean-Luc.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.816
I'm so grateful you came to us.

23:46.860 --> 23:50.864
Now, I didn't just come here
in the hope of refuge.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.474
I also wanted to...

23:52.518 --> 23:54.345
I know.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.173
We're not going to stay.

23:56.217 --> 24:00.003
Uh, I-I'm not gonna put
all of you in danger.

24:00.047 --> 24:03.790
The minute that I get
the next move sorted,

24:03.833 --> 24:05.313
Soji and I will be gone.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.707
Don't be silly. You heard Will.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.839
Stay as long as you like.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.236
It's just that...

24:15.279 --> 24:17.499
if something were
to happen to Kestra...

24:17.543 --> 24:20.241
Of course. Deanna, I understand.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.420
I'm not as brave
as I used to be, Jean-Luc.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.379
Then you're getting wiser.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.403
RAFFI:
Damn it.

24:52.447 --> 24:53.579
I told you, Chris.

24:53.622 --> 24:54.754
What does it mean?

24:54.797 --> 24:56.233
It means somebody's tailing us.

24:56.277 --> 24:59.236
Must be since we left the cube.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.977
He's good,
keeping just at or beyond

25:01.021 --> 25:02.631
the limits of Sirena's scanners.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.067
RAFFI:
What kind of somebody?

25:04.111 --> 25:05.242
RIOS:
Small, fast. A scoutship.

25:05.286 --> 25:06.722
RAFFI:
Romulan, probably.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.507
One of those little snakeships
they got.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.900
RIOS:
Snakeheads.
Double subthrusters.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.598
Massive firepower
for their size.

25:12.641 --> 25:13.903
Can you shake him?

25:13.947 --> 25:15.731
Take a seat.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.910
Agnes. Take a seat, honey.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.392
You okay?

25:25.436 --> 25:27.874
Hold tight.

25:43.324 --> 25:44.934
Now what?

25:44.978 --> 25:47.894
Now we just wait till he...

25:47.937 --> 25:49.112
overshoots us.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.377
At the rate he was traveling,
he'll be light-years away

25:53.421 --> 25:55.989
before he figures out we're not
in front of him anymore.

25:57.686 --> 26:00.863
Then I just lay in an alternate
course for Nepenthe,

26:00.907 --> 26:02.169
in case he doubles back.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.347
I'm sorry. I want to be
the fun crew member

26:06.390 --> 26:08.784
who says, "Let's hide
in that comet,"

26:08.828 --> 26:10.612
and it turns out to be a giant
gormagander or something,

26:10.656 --> 26:12.266
but can I ask

26:12.309 --> 26:13.528
a maybe dumb question?

26:14.877 --> 26:16.879
Do you guys actually want
to go to Nepenthe?

26:18.185 --> 26:20.709
This isn't an outing, honey.

26:20.753 --> 26:22.276
No, I know.We're going
to Nepenthe

26:22.319 --> 26:25.671
to pick up Picard.
And the synth chick.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.631
Wow.

26:29.675 --> 26:32.634
I remember you
the night we left Earth,

26:32.678 --> 26:35.158
standing there
in your cute little blue coat,

26:35.202 --> 26:37.944
so excited about
going out into space

26:37.987 --> 26:40.990
and meeting a real
live sentient synth

26:41.034 --> 26:42.644
like you've always
dreamed of.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.691
But it seems like the closer
we get to finding her,

26:45.734 --> 26:48.302
the less you want to be there.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.045
I just want to go home.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.873
Okay? I want you to turn
this ship around,

26:53.916 --> 26:56.353
point it at the Earth
and push play.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.312
P-Picard can look after himself,

26:58.355 --> 26:59.966
and somebody else can find
that fucking synth.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.489
Why does it have to be me?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.971
I got a paying
client, Agnes.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.103
You just came along
for the ride.

27:10.193 --> 27:13.066
RAFFI:
And now you come
along for a ride

27:13.109 --> 27:14.502
with Auntie Raffi.

27:14.545 --> 27:18.245
She's gonna hook you up
with whatever you need.

27:18.288 --> 27:21.161
Okay?

27:22.510 --> 27:25.165
Is it cake?

27:25.208 --> 27:27.689
You bet it's cake.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.526
RIKER:
You get some rest?

27:38.569 --> 27:40.049
Oh, I tried.

27:40.093 --> 27:43.705
I'm worried about my pilot.

27:43.749 --> 27:47.100
That he didn't make it.

27:48.754 --> 27:51.147
What have you gotten yourself
into, Jean-Luc?

27:51.191 --> 27:53.193
Can you tell me?No.

27:53.236 --> 27:56.762
I never wanted you to get
involved in any of this, Will.

27:56.805 --> 28:01.810
Coming here was
a desperate impulse.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.725
I regret it already.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.640
Copy that.

28:05.684 --> 28:09.296
I'll stick to making pizza.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.559
I'm just thinking
how great it would be

28:11.602 --> 28:15.302
if ignorance of danger
was all it took

28:15.345 --> 28:17.478
to keep it away
from the people we love.

28:17.521 --> 28:20.263
That's not what I was saying.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.004
Smell that.

28:22.048 --> 28:24.354
Antarean basil.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.487
Grows like weeds around here.
Everything does.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.968
The soil has
regenerative powers,

28:29.011 --> 28:32.101
which is why we came here,
of course.

28:35.104 --> 28:37.019
Wild Girl of the Woods!

28:37.063 --> 28:39.456
I'm taking her
to see the garden.
Ah.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.502
Allamalan val peresta o manal.

28:41.545 --> 28:43.547
Vo peresta melinàs andlif.

28:45.158 --> 28:46.463
She read Thad's
Viveen dictionary.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.857
All of it,
in, like, two minutes.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.076
RIKER:
Two minutes?

28:50.119 --> 28:51.686
That thing's
300 pages long.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.864
Hmm.

28:55.908 --> 28:58.301
We haven't met, Soji.
I'm Kestra's dad.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.000
Will.Hello, Will.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.479
Hi.PICARD:Commander Riker and I

29:02.523 --> 29:06.048
served together on
the USS Enterprise.

29:06.092 --> 29:09.486
And you were the greatest
captain ever, I heard.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.706
The greatest captain ever?
Where'd you get that nonsense?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.795
From you.
From me?

29:13.839 --> 29:15.797
I must have been drinking
at the time.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.060
Could you tell your mom we could
use some more tomatoes.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.758
Nice to meet you.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.632
Speaking of drinking,
may I?

29:24.675 --> 29:25.633
Please.
Thank you.

29:25.676 --> 29:28.505
So I'm just gonna speculate

29:28.549 --> 29:32.379
and say out loud what I've
been saying in my brain.

29:32.422 --> 29:34.250
You don't have to tell me
anything; how's that sound?

29:36.078 --> 29:38.211
You're worried about cloaks.

29:38.254 --> 29:39.647
That says Romulans.

29:39.690 --> 29:43.129
And the level of anxiety
and fear for our safety,

29:43.172 --> 29:46.567
tells me Tal Shiar.

29:46.610 --> 29:50.266
Next, you're not the one
that's on the run, it's her.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.181
But why?

29:52.225 --> 29:55.837
What has poor Soji done
to incur their wrath?

29:55.881 --> 29:59.362
Could it have anything
to do with the fact...

29:59.406 --> 30:01.190
that she's clearly an android?

30:01.234 --> 30:03.845
And not just any android.

30:03.889 --> 30:08.067
I'd recognize that
head tilt anywhere.

30:08.110 --> 30:11.461
Kid's got Data
in her DNA.

30:11.505 --> 30:15.161
And that's why you're here.
How am I doing?

30:15.204 --> 30:18.860
Not bad, for a pizza chef.

30:20.514 --> 30:23.299
Now I understand why you
wanted to keep it a secret.

30:25.954 --> 30:28.957
Classic Picard arrogance.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.567
You get to make the decisions

30:30.611 --> 30:32.569
about who gets to take
the chances and who doesn't,

30:32.613 --> 30:34.397
and who's in the loop,
and who's out of the loop.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.747
And, naturally, it always
ends up with you.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.706
Well...
That's fine,

30:38.749 --> 30:40.403
on the bridge of
your starship, Captain.

30:40.447 --> 30:44.799
But now you're dealing with
a teenager, more or less.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.280
That can be an extremely
humbling experience.

30:47.323 --> 30:50.152
Frankly...

30:50.196 --> 30:51.414
I'm not sure you're up to it.

30:55.070 --> 30:56.550
Perhaps I'm not.

30:56.593 --> 30:59.379
There you go.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.641
Baby steps.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.773
Baby steps.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.606
Have you ever seen
a real tomato?

31:09.650 --> 31:13.175
I've never had any food
that didn't come

31:13.219 --> 31:14.481
from a replicator.

31:14.524 --> 31:17.266
Try one.

31:22.271 --> 31:23.229
Like this?

31:23.272 --> 31:24.621
Take a bite.

31:28.451 --> 31:30.279
Mmm.Good?

31:30.323 --> 31:33.456
It tastes so...

31:33.500 --> 31:35.719
real.

31:37.286 --> 31:39.810
Real is so much better.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.947
Kestra, take those tomatoes
to Daddy,

31:45.991 --> 31:47.906
and then set the table
for dinner, please.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.385
Deldeth m'rant.

31:49.429 --> 31:50.430
Zeth.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.697
That wasn't Viveen.

31:56.740 --> 31:59.874
Harpanthi. Spoken by
the Mind Witches

31:59.918 --> 32:01.397
of the Southern Ice.

32:01.441 --> 32:04.487
I never managed to learn
much Viveen.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.620
How many languages
did Thad invent?

32:06.663 --> 32:10.363
11. 12, if you count Pahlplah,

32:10.406 --> 32:12.843
the language of butterflies.

32:12.887 --> 32:15.063
But it doesn't have words.
Only wingbeats.

32:16.412 --> 32:17.936
I love that.

32:17.979 --> 32:20.286
Thad was born and raised
on starships.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.723
From the time
he was very little,

32:22.766 --> 32:25.726
he was fascinated
by the idea that

32:25.769 --> 32:27.423
people had homeworlds.

32:27.467 --> 32:30.731
Betazed. Earth.

32:30.774 --> 32:32.559
He wanted a homeworld
of his own,

32:32.602 --> 32:34.648
so he invented one.

32:34.691 --> 32:36.215
Ardani.

32:36.258 --> 32:37.956
It means "home."

32:37.999 --> 32:41.220
Ardani.
When Thad got sick,

32:41.263 --> 32:43.657
we came here to Nepenthe.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.354
He loved it here.

32:45.398 --> 32:46.965
This became his homeworld.

32:47.008 --> 32:49.489
What did he have?

32:49.532 --> 32:52.448
Mandaxic neurosclerosis.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.450
It's a silicon-based virus.

32:54.494 --> 32:59.151
It's very rare, and in theory,
completely curable.

32:59.194 --> 33:02.458
You just have to culture
the infected cells

33:02.502 --> 33:04.591
in an active positronic matrix.

33:04.634 --> 33:08.029
But by the time Thad
came down with MN,

33:08.073 --> 33:10.597
there were no active
positronic matrices.

33:10.640 --> 33:14.601
And no one was allowed
to develop new ones.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.646
Because of the synth ban.

33:16.690 --> 33:19.127
So, you see, Soji,

33:19.171 --> 33:22.174
real isn't always better.

33:22.217 --> 33:25.220
Kestra told you.She told me

33:25.264 --> 33:27.570
this is all
very new to you.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.659
That you're very new.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.879
That's just a guess.

33:31.922 --> 33:34.621
I really don't know
anything at all.

33:34.664 --> 33:37.624
Except that, for some reason,

33:37.667 --> 33:39.974
the Romulans are very
interested in figuring out

33:40.018 --> 33:41.845
where I came from.

33:41.889 --> 33:45.545
Where I was... made.

33:45.588 --> 33:48.548
Well, one Romulan.

33:48.591 --> 33:51.420
Narek.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.944
He got me to believe
that he cared about me.

33:55.772 --> 33:58.471
I thought he even loved me.

33:58.514 --> 34:01.691
I trusted him, but...

34:01.735 --> 34:04.129
it was all a mind game.

34:04.172 --> 34:06.305
He was trying to trick me
into remembering

34:06.348 --> 34:09.047
information he needed.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.918
And then he tried to kill me.

34:11.962 --> 34:14.661
It must be very hard to feel

34:14.704 --> 34:16.576
that you can trust
anyone now.

34:16.619 --> 34:19.666
You think?

34:19.709 --> 34:22.277
This way that you're
being right now,

34:22.321 --> 34:24.801
all sensitive and caring,

34:24.845 --> 34:27.065
that makes me trust you less.

34:28.588 --> 34:30.198
I don't trust you

34:30.242 --> 34:34.115
or Kestra; I definitely
don't trust Picard.

34:34.159 --> 34:37.249
This whole thing,
if it's even really happening,

34:37.292 --> 34:39.425
how do I know
it's not another game?

34:39.468 --> 34:41.122
That it isn't real?

34:41.166 --> 34:44.212
Like my childhood.
Like my parents.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.909
You bring me to this
beautiful place,

34:45.953 --> 34:49.696
surround me with warm, friendly
people and good food, and...

34:49.739 --> 34:52.612
Torture you?
Destroy you?

34:52.655 --> 34:54.048
Yeah, you're right.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.572
All this is an elaborate plot.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.400
I wouldn't trust any of us
if I were you.

35:06.669 --> 35:09.281
Hey, hey!

35:12.545 --> 35:14.547
All you had to say is
"dinner is served."

35:14.590 --> 35:16.070
You all right?

35:16.114 --> 35:18.855
She could have
broken me in half.

35:18.899 --> 35:23.382
I suppose I should be encouraged
that she held back.

35:24.557 --> 35:25.819
Baby steps.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.168
Yes, sir.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.604
This isn't something
a ship's counselor

35:28.648 --> 35:33.174
is supposed to say,
but you had it coming.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.784
Easy there, imzadi.

35:34.828 --> 35:37.874
Do you have any idea what that
young woman's been through?

35:37.918 --> 35:41.748
What she's going through now,
what the Romulans did to her?

35:41.791 --> 35:46.579
To you, the idea that
all this could be some kind

35:46.622 --> 35:49.930
of subterfuge or simulation
is preposterous.

35:49.973 --> 35:54.064
But to her, it would be
more of the same.

35:54.108 --> 35:57.633
You know you're real, but she
has no reason to believe that.

35:57.677 --> 36:00.636
She has no reason to believe
that she herself is real.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.248
Her capacity to trust

36:03.291 --> 36:06.251
was a flaw in her programming.

36:06.294 --> 36:10.080
She's been manipulated,
tortured.

36:10.124 --> 36:12.779
Her very consciousness
has been violated.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.346
KESTRA:
Dad!

36:21.091 --> 36:23.268
What I need to be...

36:23.311 --> 36:28.098
You need to be
Jean-Luc Picard.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.753
Compassionate, patient,

36:30.797 --> 36:33.234
curious.

36:33.278 --> 36:38.239
And one other thing.
Useful.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.894
Let us help you, Jean-Luc.

36:40.937 --> 36:43.766
Pretend that our
dinner table

36:43.810 --> 36:45.768
is the ready room
of the Enterprise.

36:47.901 --> 36:51.600
We'll find a way
forward, together.

36:51.644 --> 36:54.342
Cancel red alert!

36:54.386 --> 36:56.214
Burnt tomato.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.739
Dinner is served.

37:14.057 --> 37:15.407
We're going back
to the Queencell?

37:15.450 --> 37:17.800
I'd forgotten the immense
power hidden there.

37:17.844 --> 37:20.020
Maybe I was afraid
I'd be tempted to use it.

37:20.063 --> 37:24.242
But now, I promised to defend
and protect the xBs.

37:24.285 --> 37:27.027
I failed them all.
I've been a fool.

37:27.070 --> 37:31.945
We are gonna take this cube
away from them forever.

37:31.988 --> 37:35.296
That sounds like
a treaty violation to me.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.430
Did you really think
you weren't being watched?

37:38.473 --> 37:41.389
And not just
a treaty violation.

37:41.433 --> 37:44.262
Open insurrection.

37:46.481 --> 37:49.136
I'm grateful.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.312
I'm authorized
to kill you now.

39:16.310 --> 39:20.270
To activate the Queencell,
you will need an xB...

39:22.360 --> 39:25.058
How's this for
a lost cause?

39:25.101 --> 39:28.104
I was that much of a...

39:28.148 --> 39:33.066
hopeful fool again,
for a minute.

39:33.109 --> 39:36.722
Thanks for that.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.137
There you go, honey.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.839
Need some more milk?

40:06.882 --> 40:10.103
Yes, please.Okay.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.498
Chocolate?

40:13.541 --> 40:15.630
That's probably overdoing it.

40:15.674 --> 40:18.894
Mm, no such thing
on Planet Raffi.

40:24.987 --> 40:27.076
Here you go.Thank you.

40:28.774 --> 40:32.908
Thank you for being
so kind to me.

40:32.952 --> 40:34.344
You're a good person.

40:36.390 --> 40:39.611
Well, thank you.

40:39.654 --> 40:43.310
But I'm more like the wreckage
of a good person.

40:43.353 --> 40:46.487
In an emergency,
you can slap together

40:46.531 --> 40:49.882
a temporary good person
out of the pieces, but...

40:49.925 --> 40:53.407
Oh, Agnes, are we looking
at an emergency here?

40:55.148 --> 40:58.804
Is it Chris?No.

40:58.847 --> 41:02.634
No.
Oh, Agnes.

41:02.677 --> 41:05.027
I'm such an idiot.

41:05.071 --> 41:06.725
It's Bruce Maddox.

41:06.768 --> 41:10.903
To see him after so long.

41:10.946 --> 41:12.557
Then right away to lose him...

41:12.600 --> 41:14.210
What's wrong?

41:14.254 --> 41:16.648
Our little shadow is back.Are you sure
it's the same guy?

41:16.691 --> 41:18.214
Identical warp signature.

41:18.258 --> 41:19.868
How is that possible?Unclear.

41:19.912 --> 41:21.000
I'm gonna try something
different, see if I can...

41:21.043 --> 41:22.523
RAFFI:
Whoa.

41:22.567 --> 41:23.611
Whoa. Oh...

41:23.655 --> 41:24.917
Is that blood?

41:24.960 --> 41:26.309
Red velvet.

41:28.877 --> 41:32.838
Ugh. Uh... hello?

41:32.881 --> 41:36.406
We got a hospitality
emergency here.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.975
You're okay. You're okay.

41:40.019 --> 41:42.587
Come on. You're okay.

41:42.630 --> 41:45.938
My Wild Girl of the Woods.
Extra bunnicorn sausage.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.722
Thank you.

41:47.766 --> 41:50.333
Soji, welcome to our home.

41:50.377 --> 41:53.249
SOJI: Thank you.RIKER: Guests get two.

41:55.164 --> 41:56.514
Imzadi?TROI: One, please.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.907
KESTRA: Do you like pizza?SOJI: I do like pizza.

41:58.951 --> 42:00.648
KESTRA:
Good.

42:00.692 --> 42:04.434
Still no contact with Rios.

42:04.478 --> 42:07.829
If he doesn't show, I'm
gonna need another ship.

42:07.873 --> 42:09.527
Well, you might be able
to find one

42:09.570 --> 42:12.268
over at Infinity Lake spaceport,
if you're willing to wait.

42:12.312 --> 42:13.705
There is a weekly
passenger service,

42:13.748 --> 42:17.578
but independent operators
are rare.

42:17.622 --> 42:19.493
KESTRA:
Well, there's Captain Crandall.

42:19.537 --> 42:22.409
He's been everywhere from
Qonos to Tyken's Rift.

42:22.452 --> 42:23.410
So he says.

42:23.453 --> 42:24.585
And he has a ship.

42:24.629 --> 42:26.761
The Inside Straight.

42:26.805 --> 42:28.371
Only, it's kind of broken.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.025
And so is Rupert Crandall.

42:30.069 --> 42:31.723
Anyway, even if he weren't,

42:31.766 --> 42:34.116
where are you planning on
pointing this starship of yours?

42:36.075 --> 42:38.251
Home.

42:38.294 --> 42:41.776
Narek, the Tal Shiar agent
on the Artifact,

42:41.820 --> 42:45.040
he showed me a traditional
meditation practice

42:45.084 --> 42:46.302
called the Zhal Makh.

42:46.346 --> 42:48.348
He made me think he was just

42:48.391 --> 42:50.480
helping me,
but he was using it

42:50.524 --> 42:53.266
to pull information out of me
I didn't even know I knew.

42:53.309 --> 42:56.574
Well, did he get
the information?

42:56.617 --> 43:00.621
I was so stupid.
Yes, he got it.

43:00.665 --> 43:02.231
And what was it?

43:10.022 --> 43:14.200
When I met your sister,

43:14.243 --> 43:16.594
she had just been activated
by the Romulans'

43:16.637 --> 43:18.421
first attempt on her life.

43:18.465 --> 43:20.554
Until then, like you,

43:20.598 --> 43:22.425
she believed she was human.

43:22.469 --> 43:24.602
After the attack,

43:24.645 --> 43:25.994
she discovered that
she possessed

43:26.038 --> 43:28.431
extraordinary
defensive capabilities,

43:28.475 --> 43:30.042
like you.

43:30.085 --> 43:32.435
Soji,

43:32.479 --> 43:35.308
listen to the timbre
of my voice.

43:35.351 --> 43:38.659
Feel the fluctuations
of my heart rate.

43:38.703 --> 43:41.749
Note the dilation of my pupils.

43:41.793 --> 43:44.709
Soji...

43:44.752 --> 43:47.189
you cantrust me.

43:49.235 --> 43:52.368
Do you believe him?

43:55.502 --> 43:58.679
I know he thinks he isn't lying.

43:58.723 --> 44:00.594
But that doesn't mean
I believe him.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.552
I've known this man
for 35 years, Soji.

44:02.596 --> 44:03.728
Will...

44:05.120 --> 44:08.167
I want, wewant...

44:08.210 --> 44:11.823
to help you to get back
to that home.

44:11.866 --> 44:14.086
Why?

44:14.129 --> 44:17.132
Because you were created

44:17.176 --> 44:20.701
out of a remnant of a friend,
Commander Data.

44:20.745 --> 44:22.529
Our very dear friend.

44:22.572 --> 44:23.748
And one hell
of an officer.

44:23.791 --> 44:26.533
PICARD: Mm-hmm.
He gave his life

44:26.576 --> 44:28.187
to save mine.

44:28.230 --> 44:30.668
But that's not
the main reason.

44:30.711 --> 44:34.628
Before your sister
came to me,

44:34.672 --> 44:37.631
I was haunted by my past.

44:37.675 --> 44:41.069
Uh... marking time.

44:41.113 --> 44:43.332
Wasting my life.

44:43.376 --> 44:45.378
But now,

44:45.421 --> 44:48.816
I'm alive.
And I have a mission.

44:48.860 --> 44:51.819
Which means there's not
a hell of a chance

44:51.863 --> 44:55.301
that you or anyone
else can stop me.

45:04.876 --> 45:07.356
When I did the Zhal Makh,

45:07.400 --> 45:11.578
Narek took me deep
into a memory of my childhood.

45:11.621 --> 45:13.711
That's what I thought
it was, anyway.

45:13.754 --> 45:15.451
And he had me look
up through a window

45:15.495 --> 45:17.802
in what I thought
was my childhood home.

45:17.845 --> 45:20.369
And he asked me what I saw.

45:20.413 --> 45:22.154
And I told him I saw

45:22.197 --> 45:24.591
two red moons
and a sky full of lightning.

45:24.634 --> 45:26.680
He knew
you were synthetic.

45:26.724 --> 45:30.075
And that your childhood memories
were implanted.

45:30.118 --> 45:33.339
He was looking for an implanted
memory of a real place.

45:33.382 --> 45:36.168
And when I told him about
the lightning and the moons,

45:36.211 --> 45:40.172
he said, "You found home."

45:42.827 --> 45:45.743
And that's when he tried
to kill me.

45:49.442 --> 45:50.399
Thoughts?

45:50.443 --> 45:51.444
Maddox.

45:51.487 --> 45:53.881
He left Earth
right after the ban,

45:53.925 --> 45:57.145
no one was able to find him
for 14 years.

45:57.189 --> 45:59.713
Maybe he went to this planet
with the two red moons.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.497
TROI:
And resumed his work

46:01.541 --> 46:04.892
creating synthetic
life-forms.

46:04.936 --> 46:06.328
KESTRA:
Soji.

46:06.372 --> 46:07.895
You have a homeworld.

46:07.939 --> 46:11.420
I have a homeworld.

46:11.464 --> 46:13.031
My Ardani.

46:20.212 --> 46:21.822
Picard, I want to go there.

46:21.866 --> 46:23.650
Yes. We will.

46:23.693 --> 46:27.915
But first, we have
to identify

46:27.959 --> 46:30.526
and locate the planet.

46:30.570 --> 46:32.050
Well, I don't want
to spoil the mood,

46:32.093 --> 46:33.878
but you may need
more than that.

46:33.921 --> 46:35.053
The Romulans
have a head start,

46:35.096 --> 46:36.141
and they probably know
where they're going.

46:36.184 --> 46:37.620
TROI: And given
what they did to you,

46:37.664 --> 46:39.100
and to your sister,

46:39.144 --> 46:43.322
your homeworld
is in terrible danger.

46:43.365 --> 46:45.150
You may want to contact
Starfleet, Jean-Luc.

46:45.193 --> 46:46.716
Probably.

46:46.760 --> 46:49.850
But before that,
I have to find out

46:49.894 --> 46:51.591
where the hell we're going.

46:51.634 --> 46:53.288
It's in the
Vayt sector.

46:53.332 --> 46:54.637
The Ghulion system.

46:54.681 --> 46:58.250
The planet doesn't have
a name, only a number.

47:00.948 --> 47:04.256
I asked Captain Crandall.

47:14.919 --> 47:16.268
This is silly.
I'm fine.

47:16.311 --> 47:18.574
I-I ate a slice of cake
the size of a Borg cube.

47:18.618 --> 47:20.620
Then I had another one.

47:20.663 --> 47:22.840
: And then,
I started on number three.

47:28.628 --> 47:31.239
Okay, listen.

47:31.283 --> 47:33.285
Really I brought you here
'cause I need to talk to you.

47:33.328 --> 47:35.156
Chris, you don't need
to say anything.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.593
You and I...I managed to shake
our shadow again.

47:37.637 --> 47:39.465
But if he keeps
finding us,

47:39.508 --> 47:41.641
I think I might know why.

47:43.686 --> 47:45.819
What if Raffi's
being tracked?

47:45.863 --> 47:47.603
Think about it.

47:47.647 --> 47:49.649
Remember how mysterious
she was acting

47:49.692 --> 47:50.955
before we got
to Freecloud?

47:50.998 --> 47:53.827
Her whole "goodbye
forever" routine?

47:53.871 --> 47:55.698
Then she comes right back,

47:55.742 --> 47:58.440
no explanation?
What was that about?

47:58.484 --> 48:01.487
Where did she go?
Who did she see?

48:01.530 --> 48:03.619
No...I know. I know.

48:03.663 --> 48:05.099
I hate to think Raffi
would betray us like that,

48:05.143 --> 48:06.274
endanger our lives.

48:06.318 --> 48:09.103
Maybe somebody,

48:09.147 --> 48:12.933
Romulans, placed
a tracker on her

48:12.977 --> 48:14.369
without her knowing.

48:14.413 --> 48:16.197
It's not Raffi.

48:16.241 --> 48:19.244
So, what, it's you?

48:19.287 --> 48:22.595
You've been stuck on
La Sirenasince we left Earth.

48:22.638 --> 48:23.857
RAFFI:
Rios!

48:25.206 --> 48:27.165
Shit. He's back!

49:19.869 --> 49:21.871
COMPUTER VOICE:
Noranium hydride synthesized.

49:21.915 --> 49:26.180
Warning: Depending on species,
there may be neurotoxic effects.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.973
You can do this.

50:15.099 --> 50:18.537
What is the nature of your--
Oh, bloody hell!

50:46.260 --> 50:47.609
Qazh!

50:58.098 --> 51:01.145
Raffi, I have one more thought
about finding this guy.

51:01.188 --> 51:03.190
But I don't think
you're gonna like it very much.

51:03.234 --> 51:07.107
Why? Does it involve
shooting me out of an airlock?

51:08.891 --> 51:11.459
I really hope not.

51:11.503 --> 51:12.852
EMIL :
Captain Rios,

51:12.895 --> 51:14.506
would you please
come to sickbay?

51:14.549 --> 51:17.117
Is it Agnes? Is she still
having stomach trouble?

51:17.161 --> 51:18.771
At the moment,
I'm more concerned with the fact

51:18.814 --> 51:20.642
that she's in a coma.

52:13.739 --> 52:16.394
PICARD:
They only came
within comms range

52:16.437 --> 52:17.830
late last night.

52:17.873 --> 52:20.137
Well, have your pilot
send his transponder codes,

52:20.180 --> 52:22.139
and I'll make sure
that Orbital Control

52:22.182 --> 52:25.707
doesn't give
them any trouble.Thank you, Will.

52:25.751 --> 52:27.709
You were worried
about them.

52:27.753 --> 52:30.190
I was.Mm.

52:30.234 --> 52:33.585
So? What are they like,
this new crew of yours?

52:33.628 --> 52:35.935
Well, I would have to say

52:35.978 --> 52:37.893
they are
decidedly motley.

52:37.937 --> 52:41.984
There's been nothing but drama
since we left Earth orbit.

52:42.028 --> 52:43.986
And I'm told,
it's been continuing

52:44.030 --> 52:46.206
since I saw them last.

52:46.250 --> 52:50.863
They... they seem to be
carrying more baggage

52:50.906 --> 52:53.431
than all of you ever did.

52:53.474 --> 52:57.391
But then...
I'm not the one to talk.

52:58.740 --> 53:01.003
Mm, which reminds me.

53:01.047 --> 53:02.179
Rios.

53:02.222 --> 53:03.658
ETA?

53:03.702 --> 53:06.052
Same as the last two times
you asked me.

53:06.095 --> 53:09.925
Rios out.

53:09.969 --> 53:13.320
He can be
a little testy sometimes.

53:13.364 --> 53:15.235
Well, that's,
that's one word for it.

53:19.283 --> 53:21.894
PICARD:
Do you ever think about
shipping out again?

53:21.937 --> 53:25.114
RIKER:
Well, I am still
on active reserve.

53:25.158 --> 53:27.378
But it would have to be
a very good reason.

53:32.121 --> 53:34.863
Jean-Luc...

53:38.084 --> 53:40.173
You've done more than your
fair share of planet-saving

53:40.217 --> 53:41.914
in your day.
And nobody would blame you

53:41.957 --> 53:43.524
if you just stayed home

53:43.568 --> 53:48.094
and let other people look after
the galaxy for a while.

53:48.137 --> 53:51.967
Especially given
your... your condition.

53:52.011 --> 53:55.449
I mean,
nobody but me, that is.

53:55.493 --> 53:56.929
I never thought you had
any business retiring

53:56.972 --> 53:58.017
in the first place.

53:59.932 --> 54:02.674
And you were right.

54:08.506 --> 54:10.856
Beautiful.

54:12.901 --> 54:14.599
Thank you, Will.

54:14.642 --> 54:17.341
What for?

54:17.384 --> 54:21.780
Oh... for so many things.

54:21.823 --> 54:24.435
But today...

54:24.478 --> 54:28.090
for not trying to talk me
out of all this.

54:28.134 --> 54:30.528
Believe me, I know better.

54:30.571 --> 54:33.182
That, my friend,

54:33.226 --> 54:35.968
is always a losing proposition.

55:04.126 --> 55:05.824
Hi.

55:07.869 --> 55:11.395
So...

55:11.438 --> 55:13.310
I'm gonna miss you.

55:17.879 --> 55:19.403
I'm gonna miss
you, too.

55:20.839 --> 55:23.015
I...

55:23.058 --> 55:26.540
I don't totally get it.

55:26.584 --> 55:30.109
But I do know something
really bad happened to you.

55:32.241 --> 55:34.766
Something really bad
happened to me, too.

55:36.811 --> 55:40.380
And what helped me through it
was my mom and my dad.

55:40.424 --> 55:43.514
You don't have
a mom and a dad.

55:43.557 --> 55:45.820
But you have Captain Picard.

55:45.864 --> 55:49.041
I don't have Picard.

55:49.084 --> 55:51.173
But you could.

55:51.217 --> 55:52.566
If you wanted to

55:52.610 --> 55:55.308
is all I'm saying, and...

55:55.352 --> 55:57.658
and he could have you.

55:57.702 --> 56:01.314
And you could both
have each other.

56:02.750 --> 56:04.883
I'll think about it.

56:20.899 --> 56:22.988
Wait, wait-wait-wait!

56:32.214 --> 56:35.696
You just have to pretend
it works.

56:56.369 --> 56:58.371
Two to beam up.
