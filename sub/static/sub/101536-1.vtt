00:59.466 --> 01:02.037
Oh, right.
I got excited.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.472
- Anyway, we got him.
- Banh Mi Shop. Second floor.

01:06.807 --> 01:09.911
He's got to know
we're coming now.

01:09.978 --> 01:14.581
Let's go, guys. Places ASAP.
At Start Of Project.

01:14.648 --> 01:17.986
Like, man,
I'm not going out there and getting eaten.

01:18.053 --> 01:21.056
Guys, we're here to prove
that there is no monster.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.959

a flawless track record.

01:24.025 --> 01:25.626
You don't
understand, Velma.

01:25.693 --> 01:28.562
I'm like the boy
who cried wolf.

01:28.629 --> 01:33.234
I keep warning you, but like, you won't
believe me until I finally get eaten.

01:33.301 --> 01:36.570
I don't think you guys were
listening when I told you that story.

01:36.637 --> 01:42.277
Point is, being afraid is a waste of time.
Monsters aren't real.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.087
Huh?

01:54.422 --> 01:57.491
Excuse me,
we don't know these guys.

04:29.043 --> 04:33.014
Your days of scaring people on Highway
13 are over, Haunted Scarecrow.

04:33.081 --> 04:37.352
Or should we call you...
Regular Scarecrow?

04:37.418 --> 04:38.953
Whoa. I guess you should.

04:39.020 --> 04:40.654
Aren't you sweaty in there?

04:40.721 --> 04:44.725
Not just any scarecrow,
but the Scarecrow.

04:44.791 --> 04:46.928
AKA Dr. Jonathan Crane,

04:46.995 --> 04:50.664
former professor of psychology in
Gotham City turned supervillain.

04:50.731 --> 04:53.535
And recently, an escapee
from Arkham Asylum.

04:53.601 --> 04:57.972
Nice work. That's a mighty
big fish you kids trapped there.

04:58.039 --> 05:00.275
It wasn't a trap.
It was an app.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.243
They're totally
different things.

05:02.310 --> 05:05.746
Still. This one's wanted for
crimes all over the East Coast.

05:05.812 --> 05:09.117
I can already feel the paperwork
burrowing into my skull.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.753
Any last words before the law
throws a book on you?

05:12.819 --> 05:16.690
"I would've..."
Come on, say it with me...

05:16.757 --> 05:20.995
"I would've gotten away
with it too if...

05:21.062 --> 05:22.696
If it hadn't been..."

05:22.763 --> 05:26.267
Oh, but I am getting
away with it.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.777
- Drones.
- A dead man's switch.

05:36.843 --> 05:41.482
You shut down the signal I use
to control my gas grenade drones,

05:41.549 --> 05:45.320
but that same signal is the only
thing that stops my friends here

05:45.386 --> 05:51.725
from plunging this entire town into
76 hours of unmitigated terror.

05:53.428 --> 05:56.497
And so the fate
of Crystal Cove was left

05:56.564 --> 06:00.068
in the capable hands of
the Avocado Toast Generation.

06:00.134 --> 06:03.104
- I... I gotta let him go.
- Wait!

06:27.861 --> 06:30.965
Shaggy. Shaggy, it's over.
You got them all.

06:31.032 --> 06:34.135
I know. I'm just rewarding us
for a job well done.

06:39.674 --> 06:43.444
- Ralvsies?
- Ralvsies? Rabsolutely.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.352
Special thanks to Mystery Incorporated,

06:51.419 --> 06:54.155
for proving once again
that most creeps

06:54.222 --> 06:58.960
are just regular guys
with bad gas and worse ideas.

07:03.131 --> 07:07.035
All right. Let's see some dancing up in here.

07:07.101 --> 07:11.205
Elvira's Halloween Highway
of Horror Parade is back on.

07:13.641 --> 07:19.514
<i>Um, no, sorry. That's not true. This is, uh,
this is sort of a federal crime scene now.</i>

07:20.682 --> 07:22.717
This isn't possible.

07:22.784 --> 07:27.221
I was in hiding until you
meddling young adults came along.

07:27.288 --> 07:29.891
How could you have
known where to find me?

07:29.957 --> 07:34.062
We're Mystery Incorporated.
This is who we are. This is what we do.

07:34.128 --> 07:35.697
- Word.
- Okay.

07:35.763 --> 07:38.900
We've always solved mysteries
and we always will.

07:38.966 --> 07:40.335
Nothing but net!

07:40.401 --> 07:42.804
Frankly, taking you
down was easy.

07:42.869 --> 07:44.138
Basic.

07:44.205 --> 07:45.540
I found traces
of an unknown substance

07:45.606 --> 07:48.109
on a piece of fan mail
sent to Elvira.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.912
Analysis confirmed it to be
residue from a toxic gas

07:50.978 --> 07:53.114
derived from
the Tibetan Blue Poppy,

07:53.181 --> 07:54.615
the signature weapon

07:54.682 --> 07:58.553
of the 53rd most infamous
supervillain in the world.

07:58.619 --> 08:01.155
How about a little
sick burn, Scarecrow?

08:01.222 --> 08:03.624
From there, we assumed
you'd strike during the parade

08:03.691 --> 08:06.694
and tracked your gas leak
with an air quality meter.

08:06.761 --> 08:10.665
I wrote the app to counter the signal
used to control your gas grenades myself.

08:10.732 --> 08:12.100
Womp womp.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.103
Just one problem.

08:15.169 --> 08:19.273
I only steal
Toe Omni-Tech gear.

08:19.340 --> 08:21.409
It doesn't leak.

08:24.645 --> 08:26.781
Get him in the truck.

08:26.848 --> 08:33.054
I'm not afraid of you, Crane. Fear is an
illogical reaction to an imagined threat.

08:33.121 --> 08:36.758
Fearless, then. Intelligent.
Proud and stubborn.

08:36.824 --> 08:42.363
You remind me very much of the one
person in this world I care about.

08:42.430 --> 08:47.835
For that reason,
I'll do you one favor and tell you...

08:47.902 --> 08:51.005
that while I might be
the one in chains,

08:51.072 --> 08:55.243
I believe we are both caught
in the same trap.

08:55.309 --> 08:58.546
- It was an app.
- Wait. What's that supposed to mean?

09:13.261 --> 09:17.465
Guys. She's gonna be okay.
She told me.

09:21.836 --> 09:25.873
Guys. Check this out.
My arms aren't shaking.

09:25.940 --> 09:30.378
And I feel super weird.
Like my heart's beating in slow motion.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.413
Yeah. Me too.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.883
Internet medical site.

09:34.949 --> 09:39.787
No! You guys just have a temporary
case of "not being scared."

09:39.854 --> 09:43.524
Probably because we finished our
Halloween mystery before dinner.

09:43.591 --> 09:47.962
Well, then, like, what are we waiting for?
We should be celebrating.

09:50.998 --> 09:53.601
Scooby-Doo, old buddy,
we need to be trick-or-treating

09:53.668 --> 09:56.137
right now while
the trick-or-treating is hot!

09:56.204 --> 10:00.341
- Trick-or-treating?
- Aren't you two too old for trick-or-treating?

10:00.408 --> 10:04.345
No. Oh! Shoot, though...
We don't have costumes.

10:04.412 --> 10:07.248
I would need
the perfect costume.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.283
We didn't think
we'd need costumes.

10:09.350 --> 10:13.087
Last year we were up past midnight
chasing the ghosts of The Three Stooges.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.062
Like, necessity is the mother
of invention.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.501
All we need to do is
chew up some candy like so.

10:30.538 --> 10:34.575
And we chew it to produce
a sticky resin, thusly.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.214
Sprinkle some happy little
wrapped candies,

10:40.281 --> 10:42.350
and top it off with
a couple of buckets.

10:42.416 --> 10:45.988
And boom. We're, like,
spilled Halloween candy.

10:48.891 --> 10:50.291
Oh, my.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.626
But sort of brilliant.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.028
If you already had
all that candy,

10:54.095 --> 10:56.097
why do you want
to trick-or-treat?

10:56.163 --> 10:58.165
This is, like,
our seed candy, Daph.

10:58.232 --> 11:00.735
You gotta have candy
to make candy.

11:03.571 --> 11:05.706
Like, we'll meet you
at the Corn Maze.

11:29.564 --> 11:33.267
Scoob. We did it.

11:33.334 --> 11:36.737
This is the mother lode.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.308
Scooby Snacks.

11:40.374 --> 11:44.845
This totally makes all the itchiness from
the candy drying on our skin worth it.

11:54.589 --> 11:55.756
Phew.

11:58.626 --> 12:00.294
Hmm?

12:10.638 --> 12:14.709
It's like one of those
drones we shot down.

12:14.775 --> 12:15.776
Bleh.

12:18.312 --> 12:21.248
"Tot-alli Frame."

12:21.315 --> 12:24.318
Totalli Frame, man!

13:00.454 --> 13:02.256
Scoob, those pumpkins
are, like,

13:02.323 --> 13:06.360
drinking up a mixture of toxic
waste and concentrated fear gas.

13:06.427 --> 13:10.464
Like, we need to get these Scooby Snacks
as far away from here as possible.

13:24.378 --> 13:26.882
I think we need to get us
out of here, too.

13:35.991 --> 13:37.959
Giddy up, Scoob!

13:40.028 --> 13:42.329
Oh, no. You giddy up.

13:42.396 --> 13:44.166
- No. You giddy up.
- No. You giddy up.

13:44.231 --> 13:47.002
- You giddy up.
- No. You giddy up.

14:02.249 --> 14:04.251
Okay, we both giddy up.

14:04.318 --> 14:07.221
Double giddy up,
on the double.

14:29.978 --> 14:31.512
Run, Scoob.

14:59.373 --> 15:01.776
Huh.

15:12.020 --> 15:15.389
Oh. Run. Run!

15:20.394 --> 15:23.798
Ever since you kids unmasked
the Trash Monster of Scranton,

15:23.864 --> 15:27.368
it's me who's been warning you
not to mess with law enforcement.

15:27.434 --> 15:33.474
I want you kids to remember that whatever
happens next, you brought this on yourselves.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.776
But we caught the villain.

15:35.843 --> 15:37.478
You're in over
your heads on this one.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.081
Just go home
and leave it to the pros.

15:43.084 --> 15:46.188
Jeepers. I hope
we did the right thing.

15:46.254 --> 15:47.621
Of course we did.

15:55.096 --> 15:58.632
Thank you
for saving Crystal Cove.

15:58.699 --> 16:01.602
Happy Halloween, pardners.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.838
Oh, my gosh. Thank you?

16:03.905 --> 16:05.907
Oh, little girl,
you don't have to do that.

16:05.974 --> 16:09.978
It's cool. She wanted to do
it, so I told her it was okay.

16:10.045 --> 16:11.712
Aw, well, thank you both.

16:11.779 --> 16:15.783
No problem. I'm Mike.
This little cowpoke is Michelle.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.886
You guys really
did save the town.

16:17.953 --> 16:20.088
You ever need anything,
just ask.

16:20.155 --> 16:22.958
Maybe I'll buy y'all
a caramel corn later on.

16:23.858 --> 16:24.825
Hey, nerds.

16:25.961 --> 16:28.897
Oh, you all turned around?
Wow.

16:28.964 --> 16:31.099
Well, it turns out
these reporters

16:31.166 --> 16:33.734
want to interview you
for capturing the Scarecrow

16:33.801 --> 16:39.207
instead of me for being the hottest Grand
Marshal this side of the River Styx.

16:39.274 --> 16:41.142
No accounting for taste.

16:41.209 --> 16:45.247
Who? Us? On TV?

16:45.313 --> 16:48.216
This could be big, guys.
This could be our moment.

16:49.516 --> 16:51.619
Please.
One question at a time.

16:51.685 --> 16:54.189
Victoria Hasselbaum from
<i>Newsy McNews Face News.</i>

16:54.256 --> 16:57.424
Is this all of you? I was told there
were five. I see less than five.

16:57.491 --> 16:59.060
Scooby and Shaggy
were right here.

16:59.127 --> 17:02.529
They're always nearby.
Just usually hiding.

17:03.764 --> 17:06.600
Those are the ones.

17:08.535 --> 17:11.438
Toxic waste
and fear gas combo.

17:11.505 --> 17:15.776
Like dogs, but pumpkins.
They're pumpkins.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.447
They were like jackals,

17:20.514 --> 17:22.884
only they were like
Jack-O'-Lanterns.

17:22.951 --> 17:24.451
Jackal Lanterns.

17:27.155 --> 17:28.957
Only terrifying.

17:29.024 --> 17:32.060
And they're coming this way.
You gotta believe us, man.

17:32.127 --> 17:34.930
Have you caught sight of these
Jackal Lanterns? I never heard...

17:34.996 --> 17:37.698
Uh... This is
Shaggy and Scooby.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.701
They're, um... really into
the Halloween spirit.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.703
<i>This isn't cosplay, Velma.</i>

17:42.770 --> 17:45.639
<i>Halloween's turned
upside down and inside out.</i>

17:45.706 --> 17:48.542
<i>The pumpkins are trying
to eat the people.</i>

17:51.478 --> 17:54.883
We need to go
somewhere to hide.

17:54.950 --> 17:57.385
They're perfectly sane.
From a certain point of view.

17:57.451 --> 18:01.356
They're... they're just wired
up on candy, I think.

18:01.423 --> 18:03.024
Excuse me. Excuse me.

18:03.091 --> 18:06.294
But does that young man
have an owl stuck to his butt?

18:06.361 --> 18:08.662
Who? Oh, my gosh.

18:10.831 --> 18:12.599
They mean you, Mr. Owl.

18:12.666 --> 18:14.169
Okay, tell... tell you what.

18:14.235 --> 18:17.339
Let's do this a little more
formally somewhere else.

18:17.405 --> 18:19.274
It's been a crazy
night and...

18:19.341 --> 18:24.112
Velma. This is real. I'm crying wolf here.
You have to believe me.

18:24.179 --> 18:25.479
No, I don't!

18:25.546 --> 18:26.714
You guys are a mess.

18:26.780 --> 18:28.383
You've eaten
way too much candy,

18:28.450 --> 18:29.550
we've already
solved the mystery,

18:29.616 --> 18:31.319
and you're talking nonsense.

18:31.386 --> 18:32.720
You guys locked yourselves

18:32.786 --> 18:34.722
in the Mystery Machine
instead of helping.

18:34.788 --> 18:36.992
Maybe you can
just skip this part too.

18:41.963 --> 18:44.099
Just...
Go get cleaned up.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.168
But, Velma...

18:47.235 --> 18:50.171
Come on, let's de-owl you.

18:50.238 --> 18:52.740
<i>♪ From the shores
Of the chocolate fountain ♪</i>

18:52.806 --> 18:54.775
<i>♪ To the peak of the rock
Candy mountain ♪</i>

18:54.842 --> 18:58.812
<i>♪ I've been seeking
trick-or-treating for your love ♪</i>

18:58.880 --> 19:01.316
<i>♪ Well, when it's time
To wash an owl ♪</i>

19:01.383 --> 19:03.717
<i>♪ And you wish that
you had a towel ♪</i>

19:03.784 --> 19:05.220
<i>♪ But you don't have a towel ♪</i>

19:05.286 --> 19:07.022
<i>♪ So you got to use
Your sweater ♪</i>

19:17.132 --> 19:18.233
Hmm...

19:22.037 --> 19:22.971
Ah...

19:24.973 --> 19:26.740
Oh,
what a cute little baby.

19:26.807 --> 19:31.545
Oh, you're just such a cute little owl.
Ah, who's cute? You are.

19:34.581 --> 19:38.420
Man, what a...

19:38.486 --> 19:40.321
What a night.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.290
If you guys are cool here,

19:42.357 --> 19:45.726
I've got this amazing plan to score
the perfect costume. All I have to...

19:45.793 --> 19:48.796
- No, we are not cool here.
- Uh-uh.

19:48.862 --> 19:53.134
Did nobody hear what we said about
toxic flying monster pumpkins?

19:53.201 --> 19:54.701
Jackal Lanterns?

19:54.768 --> 19:59.240
We've fought some dumb monsters,
guys, but that's just dumb.

19:59.307 --> 20:03.844
Well, I'm not making it up,
so it's reality that's dumb.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.914
Why you gotta be
like that, reality?

20:05.980 --> 20:09.650
Well, you said these things were right
on your tail, so where are they now?

20:12.487 --> 20:16.723
What if these things turn into
monsters too? Help me out, Scoob.

20:16.790 --> 20:19.793
We need to, like, squash
every squash that we see.

20:27.302 --> 20:29.537
I mean,
we've been doing this forever.

20:29.603 --> 20:34.175
Since we got a pup named Scooby-Doo.
Anyway, we make a heck of a team.

20:34.242 --> 20:36.743
There is no "I" in
Mystery Incorporated.

20:38.379 --> 20:39.780
Except for the obvious one.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.916
Thank you.

20:41.983 --> 20:45.652
They're gonna have to tow the old girl to
the body shop, and the bill ain't pretty.

20:45.719 --> 20:48.523
I figure maybe we can get
dishwashing jobs to earn money.

20:50.525 --> 20:52.293
It's Bill Nye.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.429
Now, that Bill is pretty.

20:54.496 --> 20:58.399
<i>Velma, Fred. Hey, I was just
watching the news and I saw you guys.</i>

20:58.466 --> 21:01.369
<i>I just wanted to call
and say congratulations.</i>

21:01.436 --> 21:02.604
Thanks, Mr. Nye.

21:02.669 --> 21:04.572
<i>Hey, no problem.</i>

21:04.638 --> 21:07.308
<i>But this isn't that sort of
"thank you." I got you something.</i>

21:18.153 --> 21:21.055
- An air drop?
- <i>Before the mic drop.</i>

21:39.040 --> 21:41.309
What is that?

21:41.376 --> 21:45.712
<i>It gives me great pleasure to
introduce the future of mystery solving...</i>

21:45.779 --> 21:48.349
<i>The Mystery Machine X.</i>

21:49.716 --> 21:53.354
Whoa. Electric.
Massive touchscreen.

21:53.421 --> 21:57.125
An autoclave.
This thing has it all.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.426
Except a soul.

22:03.231 --> 22:04.899
<i>Hello, Mystery Incorporated.</i>

22:04.966 --> 22:06.901
<i>Welcome to the
Mystery Machine X.</i>

22:06.968 --> 22:10.405
<i>Where can I take you on this
invigorating Halloween night?</i>

22:10.471 --> 22:13.908
Whoa. And you made the nav
computer look like you.

22:13.975 --> 22:18.413
<i>Better. This actually is me. I'm just
talking to you through the vehicle now.</i>

22:18.479 --> 22:22.050
I'm chillin' at home tonight handing
out candy to trick-or-treaters,

22:22.116 --> 22:25.153
but I do have a costume.
You're sitting in it.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.356
<i>I'm like a nav computer,
a science resource,</i>

22:28.423 --> 22:31.492
<i>and a friend, all wrapped up
in one convenient package.</i>

22:31.559 --> 22:34.529
<i>Being a hologram
is highly entertaining.</i>

22:34.596 --> 22:36.763
<i>Hang on, Nye Riders.</i>

22:47.709 --> 22:49.877
So you're going to... what?

22:49.944 --> 22:52.380
Ride around
and solve mysteries with us?

22:52.447 --> 22:54.482
<i>Why not?
It sounds like fun.</i>

22:54.549 --> 22:56.750
What about when
trick-or-treaters show up?

22:56.817 --> 22:58.453
Or if you have to go
to the bathroom?

22:58.519 --> 23:01.055
<i>Well, there's a real computer
inside this thing too,</i>

23:01.122 --> 23:03.558
<i>although it's not
as charming as I am.</i>

23:03.625 --> 23:06.394
<i>Just press the "Bill me now"
button to summon me</i>

23:06.461 --> 23:09.530
<i>and "Bill me later"
to switch to autopilot.</i>

23:12.367 --> 23:16.404
Wow. This is so generous,
Mr. Nye. Thank you.

23:16.471 --> 23:19.907
Fred, we don't have to worry about
fixing the Mystery Machine anymore.

23:19.974 --> 23:21.909
This night just
keeps on giving.

23:21.976 --> 23:25.613
The Mystery Machine doesn't need fixing.
She said she's gonna be fine.

23:31.586 --> 23:34.289
- What happened?
- It's... it's Victoria Hasselbaum

23:34.355 --> 23:36.291
from <i>Newsy McNews Face News.</i>

23:36.357 --> 23:39.826
Something... The pumpkins.
They just came alive and took her.

23:39.894 --> 23:41.195
Took her where?

23:51.572 --> 23:55.777
Hank, can you unhitch
this thing from my car?

23:55.842 --> 23:58.646
I mean, I don't want to have to
pay double toll on the highway.

23:58.713 --> 23:59.914
Elvira.

24:01.349 --> 24:02.617
Oh. Hey, girl.

24:02.684 --> 24:06.054
I just wanted to say that
I love your look. Gaultier?

24:06.120 --> 24:07.488
Oh, Gezundheit.

24:07.555 --> 24:09.023
Same with my scarf.

24:09.090 --> 24:11.626
Have you ever considered
mentoring anyone?

24:11.693 --> 24:13.827
One of me
is more than enough.

24:13.895 --> 24:16.597
Or so the legends say.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.333
I don't want
to be you, silly.

24:18.399 --> 24:22.003
Just to look and think like
you, but still have free will.

24:22.070 --> 24:23.638
Have you ever
done circus work?

24:23.705 --> 24:26.741
You know? Like,
getting shot out of a cannon,

24:26.808 --> 24:28.743
wrestling a bear,
breathing fire...

24:28.810 --> 24:32.180
Not officially
for a circus, no.

24:32.246 --> 24:33.948
All right. You're in.

24:34.349 --> 24:35.583
Yes!

24:35.650 --> 24:39.687
But remember, you're getting
an education, not a job.

24:39.754 --> 24:43.524
First thing you need to know is how
I like my luggage packed into my car.

25:02.510 --> 25:06.314
Maybe Daph was right.
Maybe we imagined the whole thing.

25:06.381 --> 25:09.484
- You think so?
- I don't know. Maybe.

25:09.550 --> 25:12.353
I mean, if they were real,
then where did they go?

25:13.588 --> 25:14.856
Like, zoinks!

25:14.922 --> 25:17.625
Oh! Help, Scoob.
I've got a pumpkin butt.

25:22.764 --> 25:29.003
- Hello? Miss Hasselbaum?
- It's Mystery Incorporated. We come in peace.

25:44.919 --> 25:48.055
- Uh-oh.
- This is what Shaggy and Scooby were talking about.

25:48.122 --> 25:49.957
Is this even possible?

25:50.024 --> 25:51.959
Huh?

25:56.397 --> 25:58.299
Miss Hasselbaum.
It's me, Fred.

25:58.366 --> 26:00.101
We're here to rescue you.

26:03.604 --> 26:04.907
My glasses.

26:04.972 --> 26:07.575
I can't see without my glasses.

26:11.112 --> 26:12.680
I didn't want to see that.

26:13.981 --> 26:16.350
Oh, no. Victoria Hasselbaum.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.357
This isn't happening.

26:31.199 --> 26:33.067
Run!

26:33.134 --> 26:37.672
Fred. This is so dumb. It's the
dumbest monster ever. It can't be real.

26:37.738 --> 26:39.106
Oh, I believe you, Velma.

26:43.611 --> 26:45.646
I just don't think
my legs do.

26:46.681 --> 26:48.249
Oh!

27:18.947 --> 27:22.049
Wow. You're a regular
Mary Sue.

27:22.116 --> 27:25.052
Daphne.
Now step on it, Elvira!

27:25.119 --> 27:27.321
I'm trying.

27:38.132 --> 27:40.201
Parade's back on.

27:46.008 --> 27:48.409
Oh, no. They got Hank.

27:48.476 --> 27:52.513
They zombified him,
only they pumpkified him.

28:24.845 --> 28:26.514
They turned the power off.

28:26.581 --> 28:29.517
How could they turn the power off?
They're vegetables.

28:40.728 --> 28:43.297
It's, like, the Alpha
Jackal Lantern.

28:57.144 --> 28:58.679
Halloween.

29:01.984 --> 29:06.420
One more thing I don't like about
that big orange guy. He cheats!

29:06.487 --> 29:08.856
Well, if you can't beat 'em...

29:22.070 --> 29:23.704
Phew.

29:23.771 --> 29:24.772
Yeah.

29:38.887 --> 29:41.322
It begs the question,
is this a natural occurrence,

29:41.389 --> 29:45.426
or perhaps another problem caused by the
so-called "Information Superhighway"?

30:01.242 --> 30:02.944
Guys, over here.
Come on.

30:29.303 --> 30:30.738
Coming through.

30:52.060 --> 30:55.262
Mike. Hey, Mike.
We need your help. Remember me?

30:55.329 --> 30:56.530
I'm Fred,
from Mystery Incorporated.

30:56.597 --> 30:58.632
Yeah, now's not
a great time, man.

30:58.699 --> 31:00.634
It's just that Michelle
said we saved the town,

31:00.701 --> 31:03.537
and you said you owed us one
because we saved the town.

31:07.042 --> 31:08.542
Our friends need a ride.

31:09.477 --> 31:11.345
I said caramel corn.

31:16.684 --> 31:18.853
Fine. Get in the back.
Come on.

31:32.800 --> 31:36.437
Mr. Nye, get us out of here.
Ludicrous speed. Engage.

31:55.257 --> 31:56.590
- Huh?
- Whoa.

32:02.931 --> 32:07.468
You know what's terrifying?
It's so messed up, I'm not even hungry.

32:07.535 --> 32:10.771
Y'all cowpokes want some
of this here licorice?

32:11.572 --> 32:12.941
Yes, please.

32:17.611 --> 32:20.048
<i>Wow. You guys are having
a wild Halloween.</i>

32:20.115 --> 32:23.151
<i>If I weren't virtually right
here, I'd be jealous.</i>

32:23.218 --> 32:25.820
Pumpkins that were mutated
by toxic chemicals

32:25.887 --> 32:28.823
and can bite people and turn
them into other pumpkins.

32:28.890 --> 32:31.092
In what world
does that make sense?

32:31.159 --> 32:34.262
She's still back there.
My love.

32:34.328 --> 32:37.731
No, Daphne made it out with Elvira.
They're right up ahead.

32:37.798 --> 32:40.367
No. No.
The Mystery Machine.

32:40.434 --> 32:43.404
We left her back there
all alone.

32:43.470 --> 32:45.140
It's okay, Freddy.
We got the X now,

32:45.207 --> 32:47.641
and it's got way more tech
than the old one had.

32:47.708 --> 32:50.711
We're gonna crack
this mystery like a gourd.

33:00.989 --> 33:04.893
Ah, what a hideous night
for a drive.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.895
Ah, so hideous.

33:06.962 --> 33:09.663
- Is everyone okay?
- Like, no.

33:09.730 --> 33:12.901
Heck no. Look, I don't
even live out this way.

33:12.968 --> 33:14.970
It's been a crazy night,
we're all tired,

33:15.036 --> 33:18.940
and these guys smell like the bottom
of a trash can in a candy store.

33:19.007 --> 33:20.876
And I kind of have to go.

33:20.942 --> 33:23.245
And my little girl
kind of has to go.

33:23.311 --> 33:27.414
Sorry, Mike. Let's pull over at the
next exit and we'll sort it all out.

33:34.788 --> 33:37.359
We already solved
the Scarecrow mystery.

33:37.424 --> 33:41.229
I can't believe that this...
event is a coincidence.

33:41.296 --> 33:43.265
It's not.

33:43.331 --> 33:46.533
You saw what the toxic waste and the
fear gas did to that pumpkin patch.

33:46.600 --> 33:49.137
Did I? What do you think,
Mr. Nye?

33:49.204 --> 33:51.438
Do you have any science-based
wisdom to impart?

33:51.505 --> 33:54.575
<i>Well, Velma, if you stacked
every ruler on Earth,</i>

33:54.642 --> 33:56.710
<i>end-to-end between
the Earth and the Moon,</i>

33:56.777 --> 33:58.280
<i>they would all drift away</i>

33:58.346 --> 34:00.581
<i>before you could
measure anything at all.</i>

34:02.449 --> 34:06.520
Okay, yeah. I mean science wisdom
that applies to our current situation.

34:06.587 --> 34:11.927
<i>Oh. Well, no, then. Nothing yet.
No idea on the pumpkins.</i>

34:11.993 --> 34:14.828
<i>The town should definitely
not have collapsed, though.</i>

34:14.896 --> 34:16.730
<i>There are no fault lines
in the area.</i>

34:16.797 --> 34:18.066
<i>There was talk of underground</i>

34:18.133 --> 34:20.135
<i>lithium mining
a few years back,</i>

34:20.201 --> 34:21.669
<i>but it was shut down</i>

34:21.735 --> 34:23.671
<i>over concerns about
the impact on the environment.</i>

34:23.737 --> 34:25.739
<i>Hmm. Crystal Cove
gets its name</i>

34:25.806 --> 34:29.077
<i>from the stalactite anthodite
crystals in the area's sea caves,</i>

34:29.144 --> 34:31.645
<i>but none of those caves
extend this far inland.</i>

34:31.712 --> 34:35.951
<i>Anthodite crystals are, by the
way, my sixth favorite crystal.</i>

34:44.125 --> 34:46.962
Daddy's had about enough of
Halloween night. Yes, sir.

34:48.997 --> 34:50.464
What the...

35:04.346 --> 35:05.813
No way.

35:06.982 --> 35:09.483
Mr. Nye. More RPMs, please.

35:09.550 --> 35:11.052
Whoa.

35:13.989 --> 35:16.224
Hey, I thought
we were stopping.

35:16.291 --> 35:18.193
Speed up. Go, go, go.

35:20.594 --> 35:23.164
Really? It's a parade float.

35:30.305 --> 35:32.474
Um... Mentee of the Dark.

35:32.539 --> 35:33.908
Yes, Mentor of the Dark.

35:33.975 --> 35:35.709
I don't suppose
you've ever disconnected

35:35.776 --> 35:37.611
a parade float
from a car going

35:37.678 --> 35:39.847
eighty miles per hour before,
have you?

35:39.914 --> 35:43.318
Um, of course I have.
Do you have a cutting torch?

35:43.385 --> 35:45.853
Duh. Of course I do.

35:54.295 --> 35:57.631
Daph, hurry. The Jackal
Lanterns are coming in fast.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.401
I know what
I'm doing, Freddy.

36:04.072 --> 36:05.773
Do you want me
to come over there?

36:05.839 --> 36:07.808
I think you're supposed
to hold it like...

36:07.876 --> 36:09.511
Frederick Herman Jones.

36:09.576 --> 36:13.781
Do not torchsplain to me when
I am carrying a torch for you.

36:13.847 --> 36:15.417
I mean...

36:15.483 --> 36:17.818
No, yeah. I'm sorry.
It's just...

36:17.886 --> 36:21.655
No. You do you. You do you.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.664
Whoops. Butterfingers.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.613
Fire extinguisher?

37:05.833 --> 37:08.702
Ha! The old
"hotsy coldsy" trick.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.972
Nice. Check this one out.

37:26.820 --> 37:28.722
Light 'em up, Mr. Nye.

37:57.519 --> 37:58.685
- Yes.
- Yeah.

38:05.659 --> 38:08.463
They're still coming?

38:08.530 --> 38:11.798
Well, at least we bought
ourselves some breathing room.

38:13.401 --> 38:16.137
After all that,
I'm starting to wish

38:16.204 --> 38:19.174
there was more breathing
room in this corset.

38:19.240 --> 38:22.076
Ooh, ooh. Can I wear it?
Thanks for the assist back there.

38:22.143 --> 38:24.979
No problem. But now
we need to solve this mystery.

38:25.046 --> 38:26.948
The trouble is,
we can't slow down

38:27.015 --> 38:29.850
to collect clues
with those things chasing us.

38:29.918 --> 38:32.020
Do we even know
they're real pumpkins?

38:32.086 --> 38:36.291
Mmm. Stringy. Seedy.
Smokey aftertaste.

38:38.993 --> 38:41.629
- Mmm.
- Delicious.

38:41.695 --> 38:44.465
Definitely real pumpkins.

38:48.102 --> 38:51.139
The fear gas.
Maybe we've been exposed to it.

38:51.206 --> 38:54.008
<i>Nope. The first thing I did
was check the air quality.</i>

38:54.075 --> 38:56.077
<i>It's remarkably clear
out there.</i>

39:00.148 --> 39:02.517
Velma, are you scared too?

39:02.584 --> 39:04.419
Of course not.

39:04.485 --> 39:08.122
There's got to be a logical solution
to this somewhere in my mind palace.

39:08.189 --> 39:10.791
Wow. You live in a palace?

39:10.857 --> 39:15.729
No, it's a mind palace.
It's a place I can go in my imagination.

39:15.796 --> 39:17.298
It's where I keep
all of my memories

39:17.365 --> 39:20.301
and store the clues
for the cases we solve.

39:20.368 --> 39:22.337
Eh. That's not as fun.

39:23.504 --> 39:25.373
Normally it's a lot of fun.

39:25.440 --> 39:31.079
I just can't seem
to find anything in here today.

39:31.145 --> 39:32.981
It's because she's scared.

39:33.047 --> 39:34.815
Scared? I'm not scared.

39:34.882 --> 39:36.783
You sure?

39:36.850 --> 39:40.688
Because I can never find what I'm
looking for and I'm scared all the time.

39:40.754 --> 39:42.223
I'm not scared.

39:42.290 --> 39:45.260
You can't be scared
of something that isn't real.

39:45.326 --> 39:48.563
- But they are real.
- Real pumpkin.

39:48.630 --> 39:50.198
But not real monsters.

39:50.265 --> 39:53.167
Aw. There's no shame
in being scared, Velma.

39:53.234 --> 39:55.836
Well, good. Because I'm not.

39:55.903 --> 39:59.707
Now can everyone be quiet so
I can focus on my mind palace?

40:02.543 --> 40:06.813
Now. What do we know
about these Jackal Lanterns?

40:06.881 --> 40:11.185
They can turn people into other monster
pumpkins, like zombies in the movies.

40:11.252 --> 40:13.221
Like, they'll eat your pants
right off your butt.

40:13.288 --> 40:16.924
Uh-uh. No joke.
Right off your butt.

40:16.991 --> 40:19.060
They smash real good.

40:19.127 --> 40:23.898
<i>We know that chemicals generally don't
cause mutations this extreme in nature,</i>

40:23.965 --> 40:28.202
<i>so these Jackal Lanterns probably
aren't what they appear to be.</i>

40:28.269 --> 40:30.171
"Probably"?

40:30.238 --> 40:32.507
You're saying there's a chance these things
are really monster pumpkins for real?

40:32.573 --> 40:35.310
<i>As scientists, we can't discount
anything without evidence.</i>

40:35.376 --> 40:39.380
<i>Even the seemingly impossible
is possible, technically.</i>

40:39.447 --> 40:42.450
Man, I thought science was supposed
to make people feel better.

40:42.517 --> 40:47.488
Nope. Science is a means to get to the
truth, and sometimes the truth hurts.

40:49.390 --> 40:53.027
Right now, truth is that I don't
know what to make of any of this.

40:55.530 --> 40:57.932
<i>Occam's razor suggests
that the solution</i>

40:57.999 --> 41:01.868
<i>requiring the least explanation
is the best solution.</i>

41:01.936 --> 41:02.970
<i>Uh, usually.</i>

41:03.037 --> 41:04.871
Oh, great.

41:04.939 --> 41:07.809
Pumpkins are tired of getting
smashed, and now they want revenge.

41:07.874 --> 41:10.844
And we all fell into their trap
like hair in a drain.

41:10.912 --> 41:12.547
A trap.

41:13.314 --> 41:14.515
A trap?

41:14.582 --> 41:16.517
Shaggy, I could kiss you.

41:16.584 --> 41:18.453
Oh...

41:18.519 --> 41:21.255
Whoa. Like,
that escalated fast.

41:21.322 --> 41:24.425
Not literally.
But you just reminded me.

41:24.492 --> 41:28.262
Dr. Crane said that he and I
were caught in the same trap.

41:28.329 --> 41:30.932
I couldn't figure out what he
meant, but...

41:30.998 --> 41:35.002
Mr. Nye. Step on it.
We need to catch up to the Scarecrow.

41:38.740 --> 41:41.476
So you're the sheriff
in these here parts?

41:43.311 --> 41:45.279
- Howdy, Sheriff.
- You kids!

41:45.346 --> 41:47.148
What are you doing
all the way out here?

41:47.215 --> 41:49.984
Sheriff, we need to speak
to Dr. Crane.

41:50.051 --> 41:52.220
Have you completely
lost your minds?

41:52.286 --> 41:55.356
It's, like,
about the Jackal Lanterns.

41:55.423 --> 41:56.457
The what?

41:56.524 --> 41:59.427
Orange. Freaky.
Aggressive drivers.

42:02.063 --> 42:04.966
What is that?
What's happening?

42:05.032 --> 42:07.568
Sheriff, please,
we don't have time to explain.

42:07.635 --> 42:11.506
And we can't explain. We just need
you to patch us through to the truck.

42:11.572 --> 42:15.243
Look, Crane isn't my prisoner.
He belongs to the Feds.

42:15.309 --> 42:17.712
I'm lucky they even
let me drive behind.

42:17.779 --> 42:21.549
I'm just trying to have a cool
sheriff moment here, and...

42:23.484 --> 42:26.354
Are those pumpkins
driving cars?

42:33.961 --> 42:37.031
- Please, Sheriff.
- What have you done?

42:37.098 --> 42:40.601
I gotta call this in.
Don't do anything.

42:46.607 --> 42:50.011
Mr. Nye, can you think of a way
I can communicate with Dr. Crane?

42:50.077 --> 42:53.181
<i>Of course, I can. I'll just need to check...</i>

42:53.247 --> 42:56.818
<i>Trick-or-treaters!
Hang on one second.</i>

42:56.885 --> 42:59.020
Wait, what? Mr. Nye?

42:59.086 --> 43:00.889
<i>Trick-or-treat!</i>

43:00.955 --> 43:04.826
<i>Whoa. All right.
Those are some amazing costumes.</i>

43:04.893 --> 43:06.727
<i>In real life,
in order to exist, of course,</i>

43:06.794 --> 43:08.663
<i>Aquaman would
probably need gills.</i>

43:08.729 --> 43:11.299
<i>Your version is accurate
to the source material.</i>

43:11.365 --> 43:14.268
<i>But the source material
is somewhat unreliable.</i>

43:14.335 --> 43:16.037
<i>He's handing out candy.</i>

43:16.103 --> 43:18.840
Hey. Let's go see Bill Nye.

43:20.575 --> 43:23.177
Get out of here, son.
Leave this to law enforcement.

43:23.244 --> 43:24.645
We can help, Sheriff.

43:24.712 --> 43:26.614
No. You stay safe.

43:26.681 --> 43:28.649
As much as I grumble
at you kids,

43:28.716 --> 43:31.719
I feel almost like you're
the only family I've got.

43:31.786 --> 43:35.256
But we've only talked,
like, eight or ten times.

43:44.031 --> 43:45.700
The horror.

43:45.766 --> 43:47.435
Sheriff! No!

44:01.249 --> 44:03.117
Mr. Nye? Hello?

44:05.453 --> 44:07.255
<i>Engaging autopilot.</i>

44:09.290 --> 44:10.791
What are you going to do?

44:12.660 --> 44:14.595
<i>Activating seat adjustment.</i>

44:18.232 --> 44:21.168
<i>Adjusting seat position
to exterior of vehicle.</i>

44:23.604 --> 44:25.273
Whoa!

44:30.211 --> 44:33.147
Oh, Bill Nye.
What have you done?

44:35.049 --> 44:36.517
Whoa!

44:37.953 --> 44:40.054
You brilliant, lovable man.

44:41.756 --> 44:43.624
I'm okay.

44:43.691 --> 44:46.294
Speak for yourself. Finally found
the flaw in this thing, I guess.

44:46.360 --> 44:48.262
<i>Well, yes,
but the pressure in Atlantis</i>

44:48.329 --> 44:50.933
<i>would have to be over
35,000 kilopascal.</i>

44:50.999 --> 44:53.301
<i>And that's on top
of the social pressures.</i>

45:10.651 --> 45:13.154
You... monsters.

45:17.291 --> 45:19.760
Daddy,
this ride is fun.

45:19.827 --> 45:23.031
That's right, baby.
It's all a 3D motion control ride.

45:23.097 --> 45:24.265
None of it's real.

45:26.267 --> 45:29.570
Daddy just ate too much pizza and
fell asleep with the TV on again.

45:29.637 --> 45:31.806
It's that
pepperoni-<i>Westworld</i> combo.

45:33.741 --> 45:36.912
Velma's got the right idea, Scoob.

45:36.979 --> 45:40.748
It's, like, safer in the armored truck.
Time to eject.

45:40.815 --> 45:42.084
You guys comin'?

45:42.149 --> 45:43.919
What? Are you
offering me dog treats?

45:43.986 --> 45:45.453
Get out of here with that.

46:01.970 --> 46:03.905
Pepperoni <i>Westworld.</i>

46:14.815 --> 46:18.252
Happy Halloween, boys.
I realize that this isn't normal,

46:18.319 --> 46:20.554
but extenuating
circumstances.

46:24.792 --> 46:26.494
Don't worry.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.829
He's behind three inches
of reinforced laminate.

46:28.897 --> 46:31.232
We'll be right here
if you need us.

46:43.844 --> 46:48.816
Ms. Dinkley. I didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

46:48.884 --> 46:52.253
So, you know who I am now,
Dr. Crane.

46:52.319 --> 46:54.588
I may be the 53rd

46:54.655 --> 46:57.258
most infamous
supervillain in the world,

46:57.324 --> 47:00.561
but I'm still
fairly resourceful.

47:03.297 --> 47:06.968
You weren't in Crystal Cove
to attack Elvira, were you?

47:07.035 --> 47:09.203
What makes you think that?

47:09.270 --> 47:11.505
Motive. You don't seem
like a crazed fan,

47:11.572 --> 47:13.874
and you recently escaped
from Arkham Asylum.

47:13.942 --> 47:18.013
Why risk your freedom to attack a
celebrity at a high-profile event?

47:18.080 --> 47:24.251
Need I remind you that I am quite mad?
I am also a fan of Elvira.

47:24.318 --> 47:30.357
I did write her a fan mail,
so technically I am both crazed and a fan.

47:30.424 --> 47:32.860
But you are correct.

47:32.928 --> 47:38.200
I had no plans to attack Elvira
or to do anything tonight

47:38.265 --> 47:40.768
other than watch
the Halloween parade.

47:40.835 --> 47:43.038
You said we were
in a trap together.

47:43.105 --> 47:47.775
I thought that maybe you were speaking
figuratively, but you weren't, were you?

47:47.842 --> 47:49.443
Tell me...

47:50.244 --> 47:53.115
Are you frightened yet?

47:53.181 --> 47:54.950
No.

47:55.016 --> 48:00.421
You said that fear was an irrational
reaction. You are incorrect.

48:00.488 --> 48:03.024
Fear is ancient.
Primordial.

48:03.091 --> 48:09.530
Fear knows the answer
before you do, Ms. Dinkley.

48:09.597 --> 48:12.968
So, yes.
I was speaking figuratively.

48:13.034 --> 48:17.638
But we are also both
in a very literal trap,

48:17.705 --> 48:19.440
as I'm sure you've surmised

48:19.507 --> 48:24.445
based on the nature of this
unusually desperate little visit.

48:24.512 --> 48:29.084
But, dude, who would be out to get
the Scarecrow and the Scooby gang?

48:29.151 --> 48:33.654
It's true that we do not seem
to have anything in common,

48:33.721 --> 48:37.893
but logic dictates that
there must be a link.

48:37.959 --> 48:40.728
Someone went
to a great deal of effort

48:40.795 --> 48:46.101
to track me down
and to lead you to me.

48:46.168 --> 48:49.971
Do you think this is all linked
to the "Jackal Lanterns"?

48:51.072 --> 48:52.740
The what?

49:04.652 --> 49:07.621
Mr. Nye, this is Fred.
Come in, Mr. Nye. Over.

49:07.688 --> 49:09.291
<i>...and that's on top
of the social pressures.</i>

49:09.356 --> 49:11.792
<i>You know, dolphins have
kind of a mean streak...</i>

49:11.859 --> 49:14.129
<i>Seriously, Mr. Nye.
Thanks again.</i>

49:14.196 --> 49:17.933
<i>It's past their bedtimes now,
so maybe we could just wrap this up.</i>

49:17.999 --> 49:21.903
<i>Oh, no. No problem.
Have a happy Halloween, everyone.</i>

49:21.970 --> 49:25.840
Great.
Power steering's gone.

49:25.907 --> 49:31.112
This thing is tight!
Hey, we should just switch outfits.

49:31.179 --> 49:33.248
Why?

49:33.315 --> 49:37.351
Think about it. You're famous, so naturally
the monsters will try to eat you first.

49:37.418 --> 49:40.588
If I'm dressed like you,
I can act as bait while you stay safe.

49:40.654 --> 49:45.093
I've heard of being hungry for
fame, but this is ridiculous.

49:46.827 --> 49:49.763
All right. I'm up for anything.
Give me your scarf.

49:49.830 --> 49:50.966
Huh?

49:58.306 --> 50:00.674
- Computer.
- <i>Acknowledged.</i>

50:00.741 --> 50:02.177
Mike and Michelle
need our help.

50:02.244 --> 50:04.378
<i>Initiating rescue protocols.</i>

50:24.165 --> 50:27.269
Lasers. Computer,
use the lasers on the pumpkins.

50:27.335 --> 50:32.107
<i>Activating type 1-4
UV laser defense system, patent pending.</i>

50:35.476 --> 50:37.711
All right.
Now we're talking.

50:48.555 --> 50:49.790
The power's down.

50:49.857 --> 50:52.260
And this whole
thing's electric.

50:52.327 --> 50:54.561
Game over, man.
Game over.

50:54.628 --> 50:55.997
Ha! Found the flaw.

51:00.634 --> 51:02.137
- Daddy?
- Yeah, baby.

51:02.203 --> 51:04.738
Now I really have to go.

51:14.515 --> 51:15.783
Guys!

51:32.000 --> 51:33.567
Come on. Hurry.

51:37.405 --> 51:39.074
Get in the car, Velma.

51:39.140 --> 51:41.443
I can't leave
Dr. Crane in there.

51:41.508 --> 51:44.845
Yeah, you can. It's easy.
I already did it.

51:50.385 --> 51:53.687
"Don't worry. I won't sting you,"
said the scorpion to the frog.

52:15.310 --> 52:17.511
Whoa.

52:33.594 --> 52:36.530
I'll need my personal effects.

52:44.005 --> 52:46.307
Extenuating circumstances.

53:00.721 --> 53:03.091
Freddy, Mike,
Michelle, grab on!

53:14.502 --> 53:16.004
A little help, Dr. Crane?

53:16.737 --> 53:19.974
Dr. Crane? Dr. Crane?

53:22.676 --> 53:25.246
What did you
expect, Velma?

53:27.549 --> 53:29.384
Hang on.

53:30.851 --> 53:34.289
Be brave, baby. Be brave.

53:37.791 --> 53:40.028
There is no time
for bravery.

53:43.131 --> 53:44.332
Run!

54:02.884 --> 54:04.751
- Ow!
- Freddy!

54:12.360 --> 54:13.760
Yoink!

54:46.194 --> 54:49.297
I love your work.
Big fan.

54:49.364 --> 54:52.433
Oh, with an outfit like that,
you'd better be.

55:05.413 --> 55:07.949
No!

55:09.683 --> 55:11.052
Phew.

55:18.126 --> 55:23.797
Um, I don't want to be a party pooper
or anything, but we're out of gas.

55:28.802 --> 55:30.371
Uh, now what?

55:31.872 --> 55:33.840
Jeepers. It's the creepers.

55:33.908 --> 55:35.944
Like, man, I vote we run.

55:44.851 --> 55:47.922
I'm sorry, everyone.
I failed.

55:47.989 --> 55:49.524
What are you talking
about, Velma?

55:49.591 --> 55:53.760
I got cocky after we captured
Scarecrow. Before, even.

55:53.827 --> 55:55.897
Like the Sheriff said,
he's been warning us

55:55.964 --> 56:00.235
that we're in over our heads since we
caught the Trash Monster of Scranton.

56:00.301 --> 56:02.704
The poor Sheriff.

56:02.769 --> 56:06.708
I assumed we couldn't fail,
and that I couldn't make a mistake.

56:06.773 --> 56:09.911
Because of that,
I didn't listen to Scooby and Shaggy.

56:09.978 --> 56:11.745
Now we've had someone
arrested for a crime

56:11.812 --> 56:15.350
they didn't commit, and we're no
closer to solving this mystery.

56:15.416 --> 56:17.352
And we lost a shoe
and some good luggage.

56:17.418 --> 56:19.454
And we're on the run
for our lives.

56:19.520 --> 56:22.856
It's these dumb Jackal Lanterns.
They're unstoppable.

56:22.924 --> 56:25.593
That's not true.
We've stopped a lot of them.

56:25.660 --> 56:27.095
They smash real good.

56:27.161 --> 56:29.564
Yeah, but there are
so many of them.

56:29.631 --> 56:33.968
And that alpha pumpkin seems to disrupt
anything electrical that gets near it.

56:34.035 --> 56:36.803
We don't need gadgets, Velma.
We have me.

56:36.870 --> 56:38.306
What are you going
to do, Freddy?

56:38.373 --> 56:40.708
I'm going to do
what I do best.

56:40.774 --> 56:43.111
I'm gonna do traps.

57:38.166 --> 57:41.969
Ugh. These Jackal Lanterns
are like a force of pure chaos

57:42.036 --> 57:44.739
that resists every attempt
to apply order.

57:44.806 --> 57:50.078
If I can just get a few quiet minutes in my
mind palace, maybe I can puzzle this out.

57:50.144 --> 57:52.814
Well, if Scoob and I
were in your mind palace,

57:52.880 --> 57:54.315
we'd help you look.

57:54.382 --> 57:56.684
And I'd be the handsome
prince who lived there.

57:56.751 --> 58:01.122
I wish I could take
you two into my mind palace.

58:01.189 --> 58:03.291
We'd just break something.

58:03.358 --> 58:07.762
Seriously. Sometimes I think I don't
appreciate what you guys bring to the table.

58:07.829 --> 58:12.066
We wouldn't have a Scooby gang
without a Shaggy and a Scooby.

58:13.468 --> 58:16.170
- Well, there is a way.
- A way to what?

58:16.237 --> 58:18.639
A way we can join you
in your mind palace.

58:21.642 --> 58:22.543
Scooby Snacks?

58:24.746 --> 58:26.414
What are you...

58:28.149 --> 58:31.052
Hey. These actually
aren't bad.

58:31.119 --> 58:32.820
Scooby Snacks
bring people together.

58:32.887 --> 58:35.289
And they're delicious.

58:35.356 --> 58:37.558
And now that we've all shared
Scooby Snacks together,

58:37.625 --> 58:40.895
a part of us will be right there with
you when you go to your happy place.

58:40.962 --> 58:43.064
- Mind palace.
- That too.

58:43.131 --> 58:45.967
Thanks for the gesture, guys.
It was really sweet.

58:46.033 --> 58:50.004
Okay, think, Velma.
Think like your life depends on it.

59:01.916 --> 59:05.386
Okay, Ms. Dinkley.
Time to review the facts.

59:05.453 --> 59:07.388
Like, for some reason I thought there was going...

59:07.455 --> 59:09.157
...to be a lot more
math floating around.

59:09.223 --> 59:12.193
You guys are really
in my mind palace?

59:12.260 --> 59:16.631
- As advertised.
- It's the Mystery Machine.

59:16.697 --> 59:19.534
Weird. Your mind palace looks
like the Mystery Machine.

59:19.600 --> 59:22.036
For some reason I thought
it was gonna be a hobbit hole.

59:22.103 --> 59:23.871
Yeah. Nerd stuff.

59:23.938 --> 59:25.706
It can look like
anything you want it to.

59:25.773 --> 59:28.976
I guess this is just where
I feel the most comfortable.

59:29.043 --> 59:30.645
So, like, what do we do?

59:30.711 --> 59:33.548
We just drive through
my memory and look for clues.

59:33.614 --> 59:36.117
Let's start with
the Halloween parade.

59:43.057 --> 59:44.692
Drive a little further.

59:47.562 --> 59:48.529
Stop!

59:51.632 --> 59:56.471
Scarecrow's equipment.
He said it was stolen from Toe Omni-Tech.

1:00:01.075 --> 1:00:02.443
Hmm.

1:00:02.911 --> 1:00:04.212
Huh?

1:00:10.985 --> 1:00:12.353
Hmm.

1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:13.721
Imaginary.

1:00:14.923 --> 1:00:15.857
Oh.

1:00:15.924 --> 1:00:17.492
Come on. We need to hurry.

1:00:24.665 --> 1:00:28.436
Oh, boy. This is
starting to creep me out, man.

1:00:28.503 --> 1:00:30.304
Like, we shouldn't have come.

1:00:30.371 --> 1:00:32.840
Shaggy, Scooby.
You were in the pumpkin patch too.

1:00:32.908 --> 1:00:34.175
What did you see?

1:00:39.380 --> 1:00:41.582
We, like, saw
the Totalli Frame drones here

1:00:41.649 --> 1:00:43.818
and then the pumpkins
started to come to life.

1:00:43.886 --> 1:00:45.720
Totalli Frame?

1:00:45.786 --> 1:00:49.690
Yeah. That's what it said on the side.
It was spelled all funny. See?

1:00:49.757 --> 1:00:51.859
Ah. Totalli Frame.

1:00:51.927 --> 1:00:54.195
<i>Time's up, guys.
They found us.</i>

1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:03.704
- How'd the mind tricks go?
- Mind palace. And not great.

1:01:09.744 --> 1:01:13.381
These things aren't real.
I just can't prove it yet.

1:01:13.447 --> 1:01:15.918
I have no doubt that science
will prevail eventually,

1:01:15.984 --> 1:01:19.153
but there's something I
trust even more than science.

1:01:19.220 --> 1:01:22.823
- Bazookas?
- No, silly. It's you guys.

1:01:24.492 --> 1:01:27.361
Now let's go smash
some pumpkins.

1:02:06.467 --> 1:02:07.568
Yes.

1:02:23.584 --> 1:02:26.721
Mystery Incorporated...
incorporate.

1:02:37.966 --> 1:02:42.670

1:03:37.525 --> 1:03:39.493
Stop.

1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:43.965
It worked. I'll admit it.
I'm afraid.

1:03:44.032 --> 1:03:45.433
I'm afraid of failing.

1:03:45.499 --> 1:03:48.302
Of failing science.
Failing justice.

1:03:49.171 --> 1:03:51.605
Failing my friends.

1:03:51.672 --> 1:03:54.341
But you've been using
those fears against me.

1:03:54.408 --> 1:03:57.611
And I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

1:04:00.182 --> 1:04:01.749
Velma!

1:04:07.488 --> 1:04:10.291
Freddy. The app.

1:04:10.725 --> 1:04:11.659
Punch it.

1:04:16.397 --> 1:04:18.900
Yay, high score.

1:04:26.174 --> 1:04:28.743
- Velma?
- Velma?

1:04:28.809 --> 1:04:30.244
Are you in there?

1:04:35.816 --> 1:04:39.020
- It was a robot?
- Drones, to be more precise.

1:04:39.087 --> 1:04:42.423
I owe that discovery
to Shaggy and Scooby.

1:04:42.490 --> 1:04:44.258
Hmm?

1:04:44.325 --> 1:04:45.793
Shaggy and Scooby noticed

1:04:45.860 --> 1:04:48.662
that the Scarecrow's drones
had some writing on them.

1:04:48.729 --> 1:04:50.664
Shaggy thought
it said "Totalli Frame,"

1:04:50.731 --> 1:04:55.536
but the "Al" and the "Li" were written
like elements on the periodic table.

1:04:55.603 --> 1:04:57.505
Aluminum and lithium.

1:04:57.571 --> 1:05:01.675
The text actually read
"TOT Aluminum Lithium Frame,"

1:05:01.742 --> 1:05:05.780
meaning that the drone itself was
made from a lightweight lithium alloy.

1:05:05.846 --> 1:05:10.384
<i>Light, but strong enough to carry
something heavy like Scarecrow's gas tanks.</i>

1:05:10.451 --> 1:05:11.719
Or a pumpkin.

1:05:13.054 --> 1:05:15.523
All drones. Go figure.

1:05:15.589 --> 1:05:18.626
What about the Sheriff
and Victoria Hasenpfeffer

1:05:18.692 --> 1:05:20.929
and everyone who got
turned into pumpkins?

1:05:20.996 --> 1:05:23.165
They're still right here.

1:05:24.598 --> 1:05:27.002
Ugh, my ankles are swollen.

1:05:28.769 --> 1:05:31.139
Everybody got put
into the monster's mouth,

1:05:31.206 --> 1:05:33.141
<i>then their personal
possessions were switched</i>

1:05:33.208 --> 1:05:35.342
- <i>to a Jackal Lantern drone and sent back out.</i>
- Hey.

1:05:38.046 --> 1:05:41.615
<i>The big guy here puts out an electromagnetic
pulse which disrupts electronics</i>

1:05:41.682 --> 1:05:46.254
<i>and makes sure that no one can contact
the outside world once they've been eaten.</i>

1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:49.925
The same would've happened to me if I
hadn't known what I was getting into.

1:05:49.991 --> 1:05:52.860
So that weird Scarecrow guy
did it after all.

1:05:52.928 --> 1:05:55.931
No. Dr. Crane
was telling us the truth.

1:05:55.997 --> 1:05:58.967
He was framed to draw
us in and distract us.

1:05:59.034 --> 1:06:00.701
Distract us from what?

1:06:00.768 --> 1:06:04.005
Bill Nye reminded us that
Crystal Cove is rich in lithium.

1:06:04.072 --> 1:06:07.008
<i>The proposed lithium mine would
have run under Crystal Cove,</i>

1:06:07.075 --> 1:06:11.712
<i>but it never happened because the science
said it would damage the environment.</i>

1:06:11.779 --> 1:06:14.883
Oh, man. Like the town
square collapsing.

1:06:14.950 --> 1:06:16.117
That's right.

1:06:16.184 --> 1:06:18.119
Someone decided to mine
the lithium anyway,

1:06:18.186 --> 1:06:20.754
and engineered this whole
mess to cover it up.

1:06:20.821 --> 1:06:24.792
Someone who's gotten to know us well
enough that he can push our buttons.

1:06:24.859 --> 1:06:27.795
Let's see what happens
when we start pushing his.

1:06:31.933 --> 1:06:32.800
Huh?

1:06:35.736 --> 1:06:38.940
<i>I'll take the "big reveal"
from here, Velma.</i>

1:06:39.007 --> 1:06:40.608
- Reveal?
- Who's that?

1:06:40.674 --> 1:06:41.508
What's happening?

1:06:41.575 --> 1:06:43.111
Who is that?

1:06:45.313 --> 1:06:46.882
The Sheriff!

1:06:46.948 --> 1:06:51.887
<i>That's right. But Sheriff who?
You never bothered to ask.</i>

1:06:51.953 --> 1:06:54.022
<i>I kept telling you
ever since you unmasked</i>

1:06:54.089 --> 1:06:57.424
<i>the Trash Monster of Scranton
that you were in over your heads.</i>

1:06:57.491 --> 1:07:01.629
<i>I warned you that if you kept
meddling in other people's business,</i>

1:07:01.695 --> 1:07:03.932
<i>that there
would be consequences.</i>

1:07:03.999 --> 1:07:05.699
<i>It was me.</i>

1:07:05.766 --> 1:07:08.937
<i>These last few years,
it was all me pulling the strings.</i>

1:07:09.004 --> 1:07:09.938
But why?

1:07:10.005 --> 1:07:11.839
Because he's not
a sheriff at all.

1:07:11.907 --> 1:07:16.144
This is Cutler Toe,
former head of Toe Omni-Tech.

1:07:16.211 --> 1:07:17.578
TOT.

1:07:17.645 --> 1:07:21.649
Also known as the Trash
Monster of Scranton.

1:07:23.218 --> 1:07:25.619
Um, I'm not seeing it.

1:07:27.355 --> 1:07:28.689
What!

1:07:28.756 --> 1:07:30.225
<i>That's right.</i>

1:07:30.292 --> 1:07:32.526
<i>Once you exposed my plan
to make everyone think</i>

1:07:32.593 --> 1:07:36.630
<i>a trash monster was causing
pollution instead of Toe Omni-Tech,</i>

1:07:36.697 --> 1:07:40.135
<i>I went to jail and lost
half my stock.</i>

1:07:40.201 --> 1:07:41.369
<i>To make things worse,</i>

1:07:41.435 --> 1:07:43.071
<i>scientists said
my lithium mine</i>

1:07:43.138 --> 1:07:45.407
<i>was going to pollute
the environment,</i>

1:07:45.472 --> 1:07:47.275
<i>so I lost that too.</i>

1:07:47.342 --> 1:07:49.743
<i>In prison, I'd learned
that Dr. Jonathan Crane,</i>

1:07:49.810 --> 1:07:53.081
<i>AKA the Scarecrow,
was a fan of my tech.</i>

1:07:53.148 --> 1:07:57.152
<i>So I did what anyone
in my situation would do.</i>

1:07:57.218 --> 1:08:00.221
<i>I spent my remaining millions
to amass an army of drones</i>

1:08:00.288 --> 1:08:04.960
<i>and moved to Crystal Cove to
impersonate a local Sheriff.</i>

1:08:05.759 --> 1:08:07.228
<i>I used my position</i>

1:08:07.295 --> 1:08:09.663
<i>as an authority figure
to get under your skins.</i>

1:08:09.730 --> 1:08:13.068
<i>I'd tell you that you were breaking
the law to wear down your confidence,</i>

1:08:13.134 --> 1:08:16.603
<i>and then tell you I supported
you to build it back up.</i>

1:08:16.670 --> 1:08:18.940
<i>The old
"hotsy coldsy" trick.</i>

1:08:19.007 --> 1:08:20.741
<i>Once the trap was set,</i>

1:08:20.808 --> 1:08:23.844
<i>all I had to do was unleash
my robotic drills.</i>

1:08:23.912 --> 1:08:27.015
<i>The robots would extract millions
of dollars worth of lithium</i>

1:08:27.082 --> 1:08:28.682
<i>while I chased everyone
out of town</i>

1:08:28.749 --> 1:08:30.484
<i>with my pumpkin drones.</i>

1:08:30.551 --> 1:08:33.221
<i>And made you kids
look like fools.</i>

1:08:33.288 --> 1:08:36.590
And I'll bet the toxic waste
wasn't even toxic waste.

1:08:36.657 --> 1:08:40.627
<i>Thanks to you, I'm not
allowed to have real toxic waste anymore.</i>

1:08:40.694 --> 1:08:44.165
<i>So I spent another million
dollars to buy green glow sticks</i>

1:08:44.232 --> 1:08:47.002
<i>and I snapped them
all into that tanker truck.</i>

1:08:47.068 --> 1:08:49.104
And you might've
gotten away with it too,

1:08:49.170 --> 1:08:51.638
if it weren't for these
friends of mine.

1:08:51.705 --> 1:08:53.008
Friendship's O-P.

1:08:53.074 --> 1:08:55.910
<i>Well, whatever.
Go ahead and celebrate.</i>

1:08:55.977 --> 1:08:59.646
<i>Even you baby geniuses
can't arrest a hologram.</i>

1:08:59.713 --> 1:09:03.251
The real Cutler Toe
is in a very fast sportscar

1:09:03.318 --> 1:09:06.854
packed with more money
than you dweebs will ever see

1:09:06.921 --> 1:09:09.157
in your combined lifetimes.

1:09:09.224 --> 1:09:11.558
I could be halfway
to Guam by now.

1:09:11.625 --> 1:09:13.395
Not even the Feds
can catch me.

1:09:13.461 --> 1:09:15.063
We'll see about that.

1:09:15.130 --> 1:09:17.232
Right? What do you think,
Mr. Nye?

1:09:17.298 --> 1:09:19.034
Did we keep him
talking long enough?

1:09:19.100 --> 1:09:20.768
<i>Perfect, Velma.</i>

1:09:20.834 --> 1:09:23.905
<i>He's headed southbound,
still on Highway 13 by the Oak exit.</i>

1:09:26.007 --> 1:09:30.178
Hope that sportscar is as
swift as justice, Mr. Toe.

1:09:30.245 --> 1:09:32.280
<i>No! No!</i>

1:09:37.352 --> 1:09:39.421
That's Toe's car, all right.

1:09:39.487 --> 1:09:41.289
He couldn't have gotten far.

1:09:41.356 --> 1:09:43.590
Come on, it's not like someone
could just swoop in and grab him.

1:09:51.266 --> 1:09:54.035
Well, at least if the dead
ever come out of this graveyard,

1:09:54.102 --> 1:09:56.804
they'll have a lot of
dead cars to choose from.

1:09:59.374 --> 1:10:01.976
I can't believe it.
I think they're all wrecked.

1:10:11.886 --> 1:10:15.689
These shoes
are the real monsters.

1:10:15.756 --> 1:10:17.492
Well, they say
that the best way

1:10:17.559 --> 1:10:20.761
to get to know someone is to
walk a mile in their shoes,

1:10:20.828 --> 1:10:23.031
young Mentee of the Dark.

1:10:25.033 --> 1:10:27.368
It is a nice night
for a walk.

1:10:27.435 --> 1:10:29.537
Yeah, I'm not complaining.

1:10:29.603 --> 1:10:30.972
Like, me either, Scoob.

1:10:31.039 --> 1:10:33.607
All that sitting
and screaming wears you out.

1:10:33.674 --> 1:10:35.410
Yeah, makes you hungry.

1:10:35.477 --> 1:10:39.214
Hey, guys, check it out.
I did not lead us astray.

1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:40.482
Civilization.

1:10:40.548 --> 1:10:45.019
Dude. You are a lifesaver.
For real this time.

1:10:45.086 --> 1:10:48.223
I'm... I'm still not sure I ever
want to see you again, though.

1:10:48.289 --> 1:10:50.291
Happy trails, partner.

1:10:50.358 --> 1:10:52.193
Keep in touch, Mike.

1:10:52.260 --> 1:10:55.897
I don't think Calamity Jane here
would let me have it any other way.

1:11:03.004 --> 1:11:06.141
Hey! You guys looking
for the Halloween party?

1:11:06.207 --> 1:11:09.911
No. We don't have perfect costumes.
Can't you see that?

1:11:09.978 --> 1:11:13.481
Oh. Well, I thought you guys were
dressed like those kids from the news.

1:11:13.548 --> 1:11:15.649
The Mystery Teens
or whatever.

1:11:15.716 --> 1:11:17.784
Uh,
Mystery Incorporated.

1:11:17.851 --> 1:11:20.421
Yeah, man.
Anyway, come on in.

1:11:20.488 --> 1:11:21.822
We don't have an invitation.

1:11:21.890 --> 1:11:24.092
Uh, well, good,
'cause we didn't make any.

1:11:24.159 --> 1:11:25.859
Is there food?

1:11:25.927 --> 1:11:29.030
Only if you count the sandwich
tray, cheese fountain,

1:11:29.097 --> 1:11:30.864
the cookie station,
the ice cream bar,

1:11:30.932 --> 1:11:33.635
Uncle Ernie's hot wings,
and the taco truck.

1:11:38.973 --> 1:11:41.976
I can also make you some
pizza bagels if you want...

1:11:48.749 --> 1:11:53.087
- What do you think, gang?
- Dancing? Looks like fun to me. I'm in.

1:11:53.154 --> 1:11:57.258
I know I shouldn't ask, but,
really... can I have the wig?

1:11:58.660 --> 1:12:00.662
It's not a wig.

1:12:00.727 --> 1:12:05.433
Daphne, have you been trying to get
Elvira's outfit as a costume all along?

1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:06.968
No.

1:12:07.035 --> 1:12:10.672
But that's a great idea.
Now we can go to this party.

1:12:10.737 --> 1:12:15.842
Wait. Were you just trying to replace
Elvira and take over her life?

1:12:15.910 --> 1:12:17.478
She's done this before.

1:12:20.081 --> 1:12:26.387
We once solved three mysteries with Phyllis
Diller before we even figured it out.

1:12:26.454 --> 1:12:32.759
You are one weird kid. And I'm
proud to be your Mentor of the Dark.

1:12:33.628 --> 1:12:34.929
It's not a wig.

1:12:36.397 --> 1:12:37.465
It's a macaque.

1:12:37.532 --> 1:12:39.934
And her name is Meredith.

1:12:40.001 --> 1:12:43.737
Go ahead. Put her on.
You've earned her.

1:12:43.804 --> 1:12:48.309
After the day we've had, I'm not
even gonna ask. You coming, Elvira?

1:12:48.376 --> 1:12:52.447
Nah. I'm afraid I'm due back
at my usual haunt.

1:12:52.513 --> 1:12:54.649
Well, thanks again.
See you around.

1:12:54.716 --> 1:12:57.418
Every couple of hours,
just stick a piece of fruit

1:12:57.485 --> 1:12:59.587
or some nuts up in there.

1:12:59.654 --> 1:13:05.026
And, like, maybe if you find a cockroach
or snail. But those are sometimes foods.

1:13:05.093 --> 1:13:07.295
Got it.
You're the best, Elvira.

1:13:07.362 --> 1:13:09.464
I know.

1:13:09.530 --> 1:13:13.134
Well, there you have it,
my children of the night.

1:13:13.201 --> 1:13:15.637
The true story
of the fourth weirdest

1:13:15.703 --> 1:13:19.440
Halloween night I've ever had.
And what have we learned?

1:13:19.507 --> 1:13:22.744
That friendship
is stronger than monsters.

1:13:22.809 --> 1:13:25.446
That there's an answer
to every mystery.

1:13:25.513 --> 1:13:30.318
And that there is nothing
to fear, but fear itself.

1:13:31.452 --> 1:13:33.288
And maybe this.

1:13:35.423 --> 1:13:37.191
Happy Halloween.

1:14:27.909 --> 1:14:30.912
Ah. Ooh.

1:14:34.482 --> 1:14:35.350
Ooh.

1:16:02.370 --> 1:16:05.673
She's alive. She's alive!

1:16:09.177 --> 1:16:11.579
<i>Scooby-Dooby-Doo!</i>
