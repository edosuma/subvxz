WEBVTT

00:09.103 --> 00:12.712
I'm taking breakfast to Evelyn,
she's still down with that bad leg.

00:12.837 --> 00:15.806
- Will you be all right till I get back?
- I've got my accounts to finish.

00:16.253 --> 00:18.887
That's not
what I'm talking about, Conor.

00:19.148 --> 00:21.462
- I'm worried about you.
- You should be worried.

00:21.587 --> 00:23.399
For your own safety, as well.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.174
Make sure you stay
on the main roads today.

00:26.741 --> 00:29.278
Don't you think it's possible
you're overreacting to all this?

00:29.582 --> 00:31.441
There's two of us dead, Nella.

00:31.713 --> 00:33.901
I don't care
if they looked like accidents.

00:34.026 --> 00:36.410
Someone out there
is targeting the resistance.

00:36.769 --> 00:38.670
When Kahlan gets here,
we'll find out who.

00:38.795 --> 00:40.903
- Kahlan's coming?
- I sent an urgent message.

00:41.211 --> 00:43.448
She'll show you
the truth of my words.

00:52.393 --> 00:55.262
I don't need a Confessor to tell me
I should believe in my husband.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.241
You've decided
where we're taking the box?

00:59.366 --> 01:01.910
The one place in all the Midlands
where Rahl can't get into,

01:02.138 --> 01:04.084
neither by spell nor by force,

01:04.643 --> 01:06.774
is the Crypt of the Ancient Seeker
at Tavol'Rang.

01:07.427 --> 01:10.415
And that's where we're headed,
with a detour to my home town,

01:10.540 --> 01:13.540
- to pick up the key.
- Pack up. We need to go now.

01:14.595 --> 01:17.910
Agreed. It's a day's walk to my house,
and three more to Tavol'Rang.

01:18.325 --> 01:20.392
We need to go by way of East Marwen.

01:20.999 --> 01:23.357
This message found its way to me
in the marketplace.

01:23.829 --> 01:27.090
- Some friends of mine are in trouble.
- The entire Midlands is in trouble

01:27.215 --> 01:29.229
if we don't get this box
locked away safe.

01:29.439 --> 01:30.439
I know.

01:30.916 --> 01:33.689
But the friend that sent that message
is a leader in the resistance.

01:34.042 --> 01:35.967
He and his wife
risked their lives to hide me

01:36.092 --> 01:38.792
when I was running from Aydindril
with The Book of Counted Shadows.

01:39.434 --> 01:41.767
We'll just have to meet up
after you get the key.

01:41.978 --> 01:43.477
Wait. You can't go alone.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.654
He's right.

01:45.899 --> 01:48.162
A Confessor can't travel
without her Seeker,

01:48.638 --> 01:50.984
the Seeker can't travel
without his Confessor.

01:52.448 --> 01:54.070
But who would trouble themselves

01:54.239 --> 01:56.282
with an old man in a tattered cloak?

01:57.977 --> 01:59.342
Thank you, Zedd.

02:00.353 --> 02:03.058
I'll meet you in East Marwen,
the day after tomorrow,

02:04.298 --> 02:05.721
with the key in my hand.

02:06.201 --> 02:08.038
The box goes with me.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.112
Too many D'Harans in these parts
on the lookout for the Seeker.

02:26.977 --> 02:27.977
Conor?

02:29.603 --> 02:30.603
Nella?

02:33.665 --> 02:34.765
What's wrong?

02:46.352 --> 02:47.625
1x11 - <i>Confession</i>

02:48.047 --> 02:49.127
Sync: Kasius

02:49.930 --> 02:51.439
{pos(192,210)}I came as fast as I could...

03:00.994 --> 03:04.391
{pos(192,230)}Eternal darkness
upon the soul of whoever did this.

03:05.639 --> 03:08.229
{pos(192,210)}This is Constable Declan.
I sent for him.

03:08.523 --> 03:10.272
You can speak freely,
he's one of us.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.151
{pos(192,210)}I'm Kahlan Amnell.

03:14.787 --> 03:17.321
{pos(192,210)}It's been a long time
since we had a Confessor in East Marwen.

03:19.102 --> 03:21.403
You've come when you're most needed.

03:21.848 --> 03:22.910
Richard Cypher.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.874
{pos(192,210)}It is an honor beyond words
to meet the Seeker,

03:30.007 --> 03:32.438
{pos(192,210)}though I wish
we met under happier circumstances.

03:35.152 --> 03:36.682
Do you have any idea?

03:39.020 --> 03:40.718
I can't bring Conor back,

03:41.032 --> 03:44.085
but I swear to you
on my power as a Confessor...

03:45.531 --> 03:48.060
I will bring whoever killed him
to justice.

03:52.881 --> 03:54.650
{pos(192,210)}Conor knew he was in danger.

03:55.792 --> 03:59.238
{pos(192,210)}The message {* he sent to me }said that two of the men
in your group were already dead.

04:01.727 --> 04:04.702
We believe they were murdered
by traitors in league with the D'Harans.

04:06.154 --> 04:08.502
One of the men
appeared to have taken his own life,

04:08.860 --> 04:11.055
but there was no reason for him
to have done that.

04:12.606 --> 04:15.648
The other was crushed under his{* own} wagon
while he was fixing a wheel,

04:16.449 --> 04:17.892
but nobody saw it happen.

04:19.349 --> 04:21.416
{pos(192,210)}When was the last time
you saw your husband?

04:21.541 --> 04:23.241
{pos(192,210)}I left before breakfast.

04:23.796 --> 04:25.765
The sun was just coming up.

04:26.326 --> 04:28.058
I spent the morning with a friend,

04:29.246 --> 04:31.644
{pos(192,210)}she's been sick,
and when I came back,

04:32.280 --> 04:34.211
{pos(192,210)}the place was torn apart, and I...

04:36.578 --> 04:38.029
Was anything missing?

04:42.101 --> 04:43.240
{pos(192,210)}Just his inkwell.

04:43.693 --> 04:45.409
The golden one his father gave him,

04:45.805 --> 04:47.860
{pos(192,210)}and a silver bowl
he kept on his desk.

04:48.761 --> 04:50.400
The sick friend you visited,

04:50.862 --> 04:53.500
- does she live near a marsh?
- No, a meadow.

04:54.039 --> 04:54.835
Why?

04:55.365 --> 04:56.933
It's just these seeds,

04:57.330 --> 04:58.955
they're still green, newly fallen,

04:59.622 --> 05:02.426
from a stalk of Kindon grass
and it only grows in marshes.

05:04.364 --> 05:06.305
There's just one marsh around here.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.115
I've never been to Conor's house
in my life.

05:16.501 --> 05:18.789
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm sure.

05:19.369 --> 05:20.569
I stay close to home.

05:21.494 --> 05:23.862
So you wouldn't know anything
about a mysterious highwayman

05:23.987 --> 05:26.404
who roams the roads at night,
robbing travelers?

05:28.648 --> 05:30.746
A man like that
might even be capable of murder.

05:36.206 --> 05:39.713
- I wouldn't know anything about that.
- Would you know anything about this?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.314
Kindon seeds.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.762
They were found
on the floor of Conor's home.

05:47.029 --> 05:48.825
The only Kindon grass in East Marwen

05:48.950 --> 05:51.105
grows in the marsh
next to your property.

05:52.883 --> 05:55.521
Where were you this morning,
Niles, around sunrise?

05:58.851 --> 05:59.851
I was...

06:00.398 --> 06:01.318
in the woods.

06:02.038 --> 06:03.038
Hunting.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.950
You can't lie to a Confessor, Niles.

06:10.118 --> 06:12.627
Never been to Conor's house,
have you?

06:17.754 --> 06:19.336
Declan, what are you doing?

06:20.038 --> 06:21.253
I'm sorry, Luna.

06:21.566 --> 06:23.173
Conor Greenleaf is dead.

06:23.976 --> 06:25.626
By your brother's hand.

06:27.348 --> 06:30.264
- Niles would never...
- {*Please, d}Don't make this harder than it is.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.974
My brother is not a murder.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.276
Let him go.

06:41.498 --> 06:43.035
He won't tell me anything.

06:44.331 --> 06:46.280
We need to know
the full truth of his crimes,

06:46.523 --> 06:49.123
so the people know
justice has been done.

06:50.913 --> 06:52.119
Will you Confess him?

06:56.786 --> 06:58.695
What if you're wrong,
and he's innocent?

06:59.176 --> 07:01.321
He'll lose his mind, his will,

07:01.876 --> 07:04.465
- for nothing.
- I can tell he's lying.

07:05.537 --> 07:07.741
In Westland,
we have judges and counsels,

07:07.866 --> 07:10.326
we make sure somebody is guilty
before we punish them.

07:10.451 --> 07:11.305
Counsels,

07:12.325 --> 07:14.975
no matter how wise, make mistakes.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.492
Confessors don't.

07:19.232 --> 07:20.522
It's three murders.

07:22.806 --> 07:24.031
We owe it to Conor,

07:24.634 --> 07:26.364
and we owe it to the resistance.

07:49.134 --> 07:50.134
I got you.

07:57.108 --> 07:59.395
Tell me what happened
when Conor was killed.

08:00.634 --> 08:02.007
It was the morning.

08:02.684 --> 08:03.928
Early in morning.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.012
I went to his house...

08:12.022 --> 08:14.243
I'm sorry I lied to you, Confessor.

08:15.435 --> 08:16.435
I killed him

08:17.101 --> 08:18.427
and I took the bowl

08:19.413 --> 08:20.620
and the inkwell.

08:20.745 --> 08:23.460
Do you know anything
about the deaths of Conor's two friends?

08:25.830 --> 08:28.674
Did anyone help you?
Are you working with the D'Harans?

08:29.100 --> 08:30.134
Nobody helped me.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.220
Please, don't hate me.

08:34.958 --> 08:35.958
Please.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.399
Go with them peacefully.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.442
Accept your fate with dignity.

09:21.287 --> 09:22.889
Under the power of a Confessor,

09:23.244 --> 09:26.927
Niles Braggindor has admitted
to taking the life of Conor Greenleaf.

09:28.274 --> 09:29.492
He will be punished

09:30.307 --> 09:33.611
in accordance with the laws
of the Midlands and East Marwen.

09:54.775 --> 09:56.384
We're lucky you came and you did.

09:56.509 --> 09:58.596
Justice is uneasy to come by
these days.

10:00.019 --> 10:01.642
I'm sorry for your loss.

10:02.746 --> 10:04.805
I loved Conor like a brother.

10:05.549 --> 10:07.008
I know you did too.

10:08.037 --> 10:11.187
Thank you for helping me
bring his killer to justice.

10:11.594 --> 10:13.487
This town is lucky to have you.

10:14.656 --> 10:18.284
Conor risked his life
thousands of times fighting for freedom,

10:19.009 --> 10:21.133
and then he dies
in a common robbery.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.265
That still doesn't explain
the other two deaths.

10:26.058 --> 10:27.066
Constable!

10:27.744 --> 10:29.134
I've been robbed.

10:29.567 --> 10:31.171
Sit down, I'll find you a healer.

10:31.410 --> 10:32.601
I don't need to sit,

10:32.726 --> 10:34.841
I need to find the thief
who stole everything I own.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.920
- Where did this happen?
- Two hour's ride north of here,

10:38.579 --> 10:42.557
just after sunrise. A highwayman
put a blade to my throat.

10:42.955 --> 10:45.116
I tried to fight him off,
but he was too strong.

10:45.241 --> 10:47.697
Why don't you come into my chambers?
You can describe him.

10:47.987 --> 10:50.733
I don't need to describe him.
He's right in front of me.

10:52.473 --> 10:53.485
{*That's i}Impossible.

10:54.298 --> 10:57.175
Niles was here
in East Marwen at sun up,

10:58.090 --> 10:59.970
taking the life of another man.

11:00.379 --> 11:01.368
I'm telling you,

11:01.832 --> 11:03.682
he's the one who robbed me.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.984
If that's true,
we just executed an innocent man.

11:33.096 --> 11:34.096
Thaddicus.

11:41.496 --> 11:44.042
- Good day to you.
- Thaddicus, it's me. Zedd.

11:44.385 --> 11:45.622
Of course it is.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.332
It's only been 23 years,
how could I forget?

11:49.616 --> 11:51.425
There was no way for me
to send word.

11:51.550 --> 11:53.754
I was on the other side of the Boundary,
in the Westland.

11:54.457 --> 11:57.925
I'm sure you had magical business
of earth-shattering importance there.

12:00.857 --> 12:01.857
I did.

12:08.167 --> 12:09.877
Thaddicus, is Mother...?

12:12.292 --> 12:13.023
Here?

12:14.632 --> 12:15.912
Of course she is.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.478
Where else would she be?

12:19.114 --> 12:21.464
Come,
she'll be overjoyed to see you.

12:49.151 --> 12:50.151
When?

12:51.059 --> 12:52.220
Five years ago.

12:52.861 --> 12:54.406
Your name on her lips.

12:54.635 --> 12:56.122
Where's my Zeddicus?

12:56.530 --> 12:58.533
Why didn't my Zeddicus
ever come home?

13:03.152 --> 13:05.158
You look like
something the dog rolled around in.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.526
Come in and have something to eat.

13:08.566 --> 13:09.566
And a bath.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.758
A highwayman
had a knife to your throat.

13:17.367 --> 13:18.575
You were frightened.

13:18.825 --> 13:20.491
Of course I was frightened.

13:21.283 --> 13:23.845
- But I know what I saw.
- I know, I know.

13:24.407 --> 13:26.557
Identical beard, similar clothes.

13:27.595 --> 13:28.765
Don't forget his eyes.

13:30.168 --> 13:31.168
His eyes.

13:33.477 --> 13:35.200
You were looking into his eyes.

13:36.595 --> 13:39.545
Just looking into mine
for the past quarter hour.

13:40.955 --> 13:42.471
So what color are they?

13:42.660 --> 13:43.488
My eyes?

13:50.344 --> 13:51.344
Grey.

13:52.659 --> 13:54.528
Blue, actually.

13:55.316 --> 13:58.176
Amazing how the mind
plays tricks under pressure, isn't it?

14:00.670 --> 14:01.465
Or...

14:01.971 --> 14:03.884
someone paid you to come here
and say all this.

14:05.350 --> 14:07.320
- And stab me?
- A warning,

14:07.854 --> 14:09.723
of what they might do
if you don't play along.

14:10.857 --> 14:12.344
That man robbed me.

14:19.344 --> 14:21.094
When you confess someone,

14:21.337 --> 14:23.187
they fall in love with you.

14:23.393 --> 14:26.093
Are you sure
that once Niles was confessed,

14:26.320 --> 14:29.422
he didt just tell you
what he thought you wanted to hear?

14:30.006 --> 14:31.995
The confessed
can't lie to a Confessor, ever,

14:32.726 --> 14:33.833
for any reason.

14:36.271 --> 14:38.116
What did they take from you?

14:38.952 --> 14:41.220
A bag of silver.
All my tools.

14:41.345 --> 14:43.401
And a bracelet
I was bringing to my wife.

14:43.829 --> 14:46.533
Green stones in a gold circlet,
with rubies along the edge.

14:46.658 --> 14:47.594
You're lying.

14:48.537 --> 14:51.470
What are you going to do,
confess me so you can prove that?

14:51.595 --> 14:53.391
{*Apparently y}Your confessions
aren't all that reliable.

14:56.093 --> 14:58.313
Did you say green stones
in a gold circlet?

15:00.111 --> 15:01.227
What about them?

15:02.445 --> 15:04.574
That's it.
That's my bracelet.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.432
Where did you get that?

15:08.970 --> 15:10.200
My brother gave it to me.

15:10.905 --> 15:11.905
When?

15:12.282 --> 15:14.454
- This morning.
- Right after he stole it from me.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.346
He stole it from you this morning?

15:18.471 --> 15:19.719
Around sunrise?

15:22.053 --> 15:24.344
Then he couldn't have killed Conor.

15:25.205 --> 15:26.716
My brother may have been a thief,

15:26.999 --> 15:28.830
but he was no murderer.

15:29.468 --> 15:31.388
You killed him.
He didn't have to die.

15:35.721 --> 15:37.021
Calm down, Luna.

15:38.219 --> 15:39.491
Calm down.

15:41.538 --> 15:43.358
Are you proud of yourself,
Confessor?

15:45.088 --> 15:46.876
You murdered my brother

15:47.400 --> 15:50.448
as sure as you drove
a stake into his heart.

15:56.696 --> 15:57.826
I'm sorry, Nella.

15:59.594 --> 16:01.294
Niles didn't kill Conor.

16:02.722 --> 16:04.832
He was robbing a man
when your husband died.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.548
You confessed him.

16:08.154 --> 16:09.463
He said he did it.

16:09.837 --> 16:11.156
I don't understand.

16:11.281 --> 16:12.431
Neither do I.

16:13.868 --> 16:15.140
If Niles was innocent,

16:15.526 --> 16:17.446
then why were Conor's things
in his house?

16:17.571 --> 16:19.311
And how did those seeds
get on my floor?

16:20.876 --> 16:22.806
We're searching for answers.

16:24.202 --> 16:25.483
We don't have them yet.

16:30.093 --> 16:31.114
Maybe we do.

16:32.921 --> 16:35.333
Unless a man
can be in two places at once,

16:35.458 --> 16:36.822
then the whole thing is crazy

16:36.947 --> 16:39.921
and every time something crazy
happens in the Midlands,

16:40.690 --> 16:42.478
there's always one thing behind it:

16:43.530 --> 16:44.419
magic.

16:46.627 --> 16:49.841
I'm right about this. Is there anyone
in East Marwen who has magic?

16:53.237 --> 16:56.303
There's a man up in the caves
who claims to be a sorcerer.

16:58.659 --> 17:01.319
An innocent man is dead,
because of me.

17:01.507 --> 17:03.029
It's not your fault.

17:03.461 --> 17:04.530
It couldn't be.

17:04.655 --> 17:06.717
Maybe somebody's doing
something to you.

17:06.842 --> 17:08.721
Maybe it's Darken Rahl,
maybe he's...

17:09.963 --> 17:10.862
Nobody...

17:11.837 --> 17:13.691
Not even a Wizard of the First Order

17:13.934 --> 17:16.387
has magic powerful enough
to work against a Confessor's.

17:18.824 --> 17:20.372
There's something wrong with me.

17:22.529 --> 17:23.628
Listen.

17:24.433 --> 17:27.503
There is an explanation for all this
and we'll find it.

17:28.607 --> 17:29.464
I know you.

17:30.029 --> 17:32.550
And who you are is more
than some magical power you have.

17:47.310 --> 17:48.947
Go! He's getting away.

17:53.702 --> 17:55.592
I'm going to pull it out.

18:12.627 --> 18:14.278
You have to go. Now.

18:14.579 --> 18:17.466
- I'm not leaving you.
- I'll go into town, I'll get Declan.

18:17.591 --> 18:19.139
You have to catch him.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.433
Go. I can walk. Now.

19:07.817 --> 19:08.817
Luna.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.015
You're a fine cook, Thaddicus.

19:46.220 --> 19:49.417
- Don't patronize me.
- I'm not patronizing you.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.272
You always had a gift
in the kitchen.

19:53.356 --> 19:56.117
Your vegetables, so fresh and crisp.

19:57.584 --> 19:58.967
As opposed to...

19:59.092 --> 20:01.658
May the Spirits forgive me.
Mother's.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.053
Remember those carrots?

20:11.306 --> 20:12.306
Paste.

20:12.652 --> 20:14.152
I gagged every time.

20:17.411 --> 20:18.633
Twenty-three years, Zedd.

20:20.028 --> 20:21.718
Twenty-three years.

20:23.467 --> 20:25.567
Your room's just as you left it.

20:26.363 --> 20:27.767
I go in every now and then,

20:27.892 --> 20:30.468
make sure the mice
haven't brought the place to ruin.

20:35.286 --> 20:36.943
Just passing through, is it?

20:37.902 --> 20:40.759
I came for something very important.

20:42.211 --> 20:43.511
What a surprise.

20:43.873 --> 20:46.497
Zeddicus shows up
because he needs something.

20:46.914 --> 20:48.746
And what is it this time?
Night Stones?

20:48.983 --> 20:50.291
Sorcerer's Sand?

20:51.182 --> 20:53.668
Well, you're too late.
I sold it all years ago.

20:54.928 --> 20:57.028
You didn't sell what I came for.

20:58.589 --> 21:00.091
The key to the Crypt of Tavol'Rang.

21:01.915 --> 21:03.595
That was the first thing to go.

21:05.530 --> 21:08.349
Have any idea what you've done?

21:09.664 --> 21:12.126
Our family
always protected that key.

21:12.823 --> 21:14.963
It was a sacred vow our ancestors

21:15.088 --> 21:17.025
made to the First Order of Wizards.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.814
Here's the truth of the situation,
brother: I'm not a Wizard.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.406
As you never{* for one second} <let me forget.

21:23.574 --> 21:27.215
You know as well as I do
that not every child inherits the power.

21:27.340 --> 21:29.527
I am not going to apologize
for the ways of fate.

21:29.652 --> 21:32.343
So the way you lorded me, that...
That was fate?

21:32.468 --> 21:35.460
{*The way}How you left me to do the kitchen chores
cause you were meant for greater things?

21:36.651 --> 21:38.963
The way it was always
"Run off and play, Thaddicus,"

21:39.401 --> 21:42.675
while Father gave his precious time
to the training of the great Zeddicus?

21:43.653 --> 21:45.729
Memories are slippery things,

21:46.533 --> 21:50.002
but the crack of Father's stick
across my knuckles is hard to forget.

21:50.990 --> 21:52.340
You need the key?

21:52.752 --> 21:55.288
Why don't you use your mystical powers
to conjure it?

21:55.481 --> 21:58.842
You always {*did }loved showing off your magic
to your poor, powerless brother.

21:59.225 --> 22:01.194
You know it doesn't work that way.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.839
Wherever you went,
you should have stayed there.

22:04.964 --> 22:07.591
That key was not yours to sell.

22:08.571 --> 22:10.269
You were always like that,

22:10.394 --> 22:12.956
no thought of anything
beyond the next penny in your pocket.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.291
I'll bet all the jewels in Tamarang

22:15.459 --> 22:19.128
that whatever you sold it for
went straight to the gaming tables.

22:20.812 --> 22:23.341
Be sure to bolt the door
on your way out.

22:40.023 --> 22:41.503
Did you see who it was?

22:42.670 --> 22:45.154
He was just a cloak in the shadow.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.750
Are you sure it was a he?

22:47.954 --> 22:49.492
Luna's out of her mind with rage,

22:49.963 --> 22:51.327
most of it directed at you.

22:52.749 --> 22:55.665
Her father made his living as a hunter,
just like Niles.

22:56.512 --> 22:58.564
The girl knows
how to use a crossbow.

22:59.157 --> 23:01.597
- We need to go her cabin.
- I don't think you're ready.

23:01.722 --> 23:03.297
I've had worse. We're going. Now.

23:54.097 --> 23:55.412
What happened?

24:00.921 --> 24:02.071
I killed her.

24:11.429 --> 24:12.867
I tracked Luna to the house.

24:13.899 --> 24:17.499
I mean, I knew it was Luna
when I saw the cloak and crossbow.

24:20.721 --> 24:21.825
And then...

24:23.769 --> 24:26.219
And then what?
You saw the crossbow...

24:27.695 --> 24:29.855
I heard a noise. It was Luna.

24:30.918 --> 24:33.613
She attacked me,
so I defended myself.

24:36.197 --> 24:37.947
She scratched at my neck.

24:38.757 --> 24:40.257
She was defenseless.

24:41.577 --> 24:43.598
- I didn't have to hurt her.
- Please,

24:44.085 --> 24:45.285
don't hurt me.

24:49.305 --> 24:50.849
But I killed her anyway.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.701
I don't believe
that you killed that woman.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.579
Look at me.

25:00.257 --> 25:03.584
The Richard I know risks his life
every day for others.

25:05.124 --> 25:07.772
You wouldn't kill a defenseless woman,
I know you.

25:07.897 --> 25:09.997
I did it, Kahlan. I remember it.

25:12.913 --> 25:15.805
Just like Niles
remembered killing Conor.

25:17.261 --> 25:20.017
Maybe his memories weren't real,
and neither are yours.

25:21.807 --> 25:24.647
You said that magic
had to be behind all this.

25:25.213 --> 25:27.313
Well, now I'm starting to agree.

25:27.626 --> 25:29.569
We need to go find that sorcerer.

25:30.540 --> 25:32.448
Well, I hope you're right.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.069
'Cause right now,
I don't trust myself.

25:36.579 --> 25:38.331
What if I do
something like that again?

25:38.456 --> 25:39.245
You won't.

25:39.904 --> 25:42.039
Because I'll be with you.
Every second.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.435
What did you come back for,

25:49.560 --> 25:52.091
another magical treasure
for one of your schemes? Well, go away.

25:52.432 --> 25:53.801
I lost them all at cards.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.805
No more waiting, Zorander.

25:58.087 --> 25:59.787
One hundred gold pieces.

26:00.633 --> 26:02.268
You only won 70 off me.

26:03.456 --> 26:06.001
The extra 30
is the price of my patience.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.744
I haven't got any.
I can't pay you.

26:09.607 --> 26:11.694
You're gonna pay. Slowly.

26:12.784 --> 26:14.338
If I can't get my money,

26:15.122 --> 26:17.504
then I'll just have to have some fun
with you instead.

26:35.227 --> 26:38.233
If you ever dare
to show your face to my brother, ever,

26:39.039 --> 26:41.584
you'll wish
I had burned you to cinders.

26:41.709 --> 26:42.725
Now get out.

27:00.596 --> 27:01.991
Why'd you come back?

27:03.023 --> 27:06.870
I got about a league from here
when my temper cooled and I realized...

27:11.796 --> 27:14.632
The task that calls me away
is a grave one, Thaddicus.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.847
The chance
that I will not return alive is...

27:19.540 --> 27:20.540
Is great.

27:21.719 --> 27:24.540
I didn't want to go to the Shadows
knowing that my last words

27:24.665 --> 27:27.363
to the only brother I have
in all the world were

27:27.488 --> 27:28.488
unkind

27:29.266 --> 27:30.266
and unfair.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.768
Now let's get you cleaned up.

27:35.930 --> 27:39.084
You look like one of Mother's turnips
after an hour in the pot.

27:41.420 --> 27:42.420
Besides,

27:43.656 --> 27:44.969
I always did love

27:45.748 --> 27:47.103
showing off my powers.

27:53.427 --> 27:56.023
You're the only sorcerer
anywhere near this village.

27:56.548 --> 27:58.397
Do you know anything
about these murders?

27:58.522 --> 27:59.635
Were they your doing?

28:05.338 --> 28:06.747
He's telling the truth.

28:07.033 --> 28:10.246
And I'm really more
of a sorcerer-in-training, anyway.

28:11.226 --> 28:13.232
I've been studying magic books
my whole life,

28:13.624 --> 28:17.121
I've learned a few minor tricks, things
you can do with powders and potions.

28:17.860 --> 28:20.698
- You don't have any powers?
- {*But t}That doesn't mean I can't help you.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.474
My knowledge in the field
is quite extensive.

28:23.846 --> 28:27.079
You say these victims
believe they did something they didn't?

28:27.776 --> 28:29.634
They don't just believe...

28:30.988 --> 28:33.981
they actually see themselves
doing it in their heads.

28:34.106 --> 28:35.212
Shared visions.

28:36.004 --> 28:37.358
Memory magic.

28:38.138 --> 28:40.605
I've read something about that in...

28:41.471 --> 28:42.303
here.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.221
There are accounts

28:44.463 --> 28:45.724
of an ancient device

28:46.294 --> 28:48.225
that produces the effect
you speak of.

28:49.632 --> 28:50.632
Here we go.

28:50.933 --> 28:52.209
Azzallel's Orb.

28:52.406 --> 28:54.523
Azzallel was a fantastically
gifted wizard.

28:55.145 --> 28:57.234
His wife gave birth
to a blind daughter.

28:57.511 --> 28:59.791
Azzallel tried but failed

28:59.916 --> 29:02.326
to manifest new eyes
for his baby girl.

29:02.451 --> 29:04.443
So instead, he created a way

29:04.936 --> 29:07.263
of plucking visions from his head

29:07.613 --> 29:09.563
and placing them inside hers.

29:10.525 --> 29:11.874
Azzallel's Orb was stolen

29:12.494 --> 29:14.633
 200 years ago
and believed to be lost forever.

29:15.298 --> 29:16.435
Hello, Bosin.

29:17.245 --> 29:19.655
Still stealing money
from old ladies?

29:22.769 --> 29:24.169
I found something.

29:24.916 --> 29:26.706
When we were searching Luna's cabin,

29:27.031 --> 29:30.206
one of my men pulled this scorched paper
from her fireplace.

29:30.893 --> 29:32.454
There's handwriting there,

29:33.124 --> 29:35.884
but I can't make it out.
Maybe you'll have better luck.

29:36.975 --> 29:38.255
No luck required.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.536
This I can help you with.

29:40.982 --> 29:41.982
May I?

29:48.612 --> 29:50.662
Dust of a Shadrin's thigh bone.

30:01.366 --> 30:02.366
Like I said,

30:02.801 --> 30:03.945
a few minor tricks.

30:10.885 --> 30:12.008
"Dearest Luna.

30:12.789 --> 30:14.633
"I can't meet you tonight.

30:14.770 --> 30:16.420
"I think my wife knows.

30:17.207 --> 30:19.358
"Missing you desperately. Conor."

30:19.805 --> 30:21.193
Conor and Luna were lovers?

30:22.770 --> 30:23.988
If Nella knew about that,

30:24.199 --> 30:27.099
she'd have a good reason
to kill her husband...

30:27.766 --> 30:28.701
and Luna.

30:35.573 --> 30:36.709
My husband is dead.

30:38.235 --> 30:40.218
Why are you doing this to me?

30:51.643 --> 30:53.543
Did you kill Conor and Luna?

31:01.145 --> 31:03.652
And then gave the memories
of what you did to Niles.

31:04.524 --> 31:05.524
And me.

31:06.649 --> 31:07.707
I'm sorry.

31:10.745 --> 31:11.869
Where is it, Nella?

31:12.408 --> 31:13.759
Where's the orb?

31:56.548 --> 32:00.198
I told Conor I was leaving
to take breakfast to a sick friend.

32:01.501 --> 32:03.501
But I didn't make it very far.

32:08.341 --> 32:09.552
After I killed Conor,

32:10.776 --> 32:13.744
I gathered seeds
from the grasses near Niles' cabin

32:14.815 --> 32:16.746
and scattered them around the body.

32:18.622 --> 32:22.562
Then I ransacked my house
and hid our possessions in Niles' cabin.

32:24.029 --> 32:27.591
All that was left was to put the visions
of what I did into Niles' head.

32:30.274 --> 32:32.491
And the memories Richard
has of murdering Luna?

32:34.286 --> 32:35.659
Right after I killed her,

32:37.013 --> 32:39.294
Richard came running
into the cabin from the woods.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.205
How could I have done such a thing?

32:53.792 --> 32:55.442
It's time to go, Nella.

33:08.148 --> 33:10.114
And lemon cake, my own creation.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.389
You know,
you could make a living at this.

33:12.514 --> 33:13.699
An honest one.

33:14.853 --> 33:17.036
Patronize me again,
you'll get a pack full of sand.

33:20.016 --> 33:21.025
Where to now?

33:21.785 --> 33:25.294
The less you know about where I'm going,
and why, the better, for your own sake.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.851
I know I'm guilty
of occasional self-importance,

33:30.108 --> 33:31.319
but in this case,

33:32.302 --> 33:34.285
the fate of the world
actually may depend

33:34.410 --> 33:36.407
on the success of the errand
that calls me.

33:45.308 --> 33:46.558
In that case...

33:50.323 --> 33:51.589
you'll need this.

34:00.423 --> 34:02.590
The key to the Crypt of Tavol'Rang.

34:05.329 --> 34:06.879
You had it all along?

34:07.337 --> 34:08.212
Of course.

34:09.050 --> 34:10.799
Mother would've come back
from the grave

34:10.924 --> 34:13.803
swinging that iron skillet if I'd let it
out of my sight for a second.

34:14.454 --> 34:16.594
How could you put me
through such a thing?

34:17.315 --> 34:18.373
I was angry

34:19.170 --> 34:21.252
that you came home
for something you needed...

34:22.453 --> 34:23.918
and not to see me.

34:26.608 --> 34:28.308
I needed to see you too.

34:46.266 --> 34:49.206
- How are you feeling?
- Like I killed an innocent woman.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.621
I still keep seeing her die.

34:52.079 --> 34:54.753
Hearing her screams.
Feeling her blood on my hands.

34:57.821 --> 34:59.874
I loved Conor and Nella.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.490
They would've given
their lives for me.

35:04.181 --> 35:05.568
They almost did.

35:06.478 --> 35:08.168
To lose them over this?

35:09.064 --> 35:10.779
Over jealousy and anger.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.450
You don't have to watch.

35:21.705 --> 35:23.186
The other two who died,

35:23.311 --> 35:26.381
I'd like to talk to their families,
see if there's anything you didn't find.

35:27.139 --> 35:29.280
I'll take you to them, after.

35:31.454 --> 35:32.554
Don't worry,

35:34.396 --> 35:36.520
Conor's work will go on here,

35:37.309 --> 35:38.365
no matter what.

35:55.104 --> 35:56.504
Are you all right?

35:59.806 --> 36:02.743
When you described Luna's attack,
you said she was scratching you, right?

36:03.138 --> 36:04.870
She went after my face...
Well, Nella's.

36:06.675 --> 36:09.828
She scratched me right here.
Hurt like a stinging nettle.

36:09.953 --> 36:13.587
I just saw three deep scratches
in that exact spot on Declan's neck.

36:15.833 --> 36:17.885
- What are you saying?
- It's no coincidence.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.345
Luna scratched her attacker. And whoever
attacked her committed all the murders.

36:22.890 --> 36:26.183
Nella Greenleaf will now
be consigned to the Shadows,

36:27.254 --> 36:30.521
in accordance with the laws
of the Midlands and East Marwen.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.912
- Wait!
- Stop!

36:32.808 --> 36:35.484
- Lower the door.
- He killed Conor! He killed them all!

36:36.087 --> 36:37.087
Now!

37:05.471 --> 37:07.361
I'm not with the resistance

37:09.837 --> 37:12.040
I've been killing
off the resistance.

37:13.161 --> 37:14.161
Why?

37:15.244 --> 37:16.867
I believed in Darken Rahl.

37:17.642 --> 37:19.451
That he would protect us.

37:21.006 --> 37:24.116
You had to know that killing Conor
would draw attention.

37:26.015 --> 37:27.315
I had no choice.

37:30.140 --> 37:32.332
Conor was growing suspicious of me.

37:33.256 --> 37:36.503
When he told me he sent for your help,
I had to act quickly.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.785
The hard part

37:42.211 --> 37:44.887
was making the murder
look like Niles did it.

37:46.881 --> 37:48.724
Where did you get Azzallel's Orb?

37:49.076 --> 37:50.326
From my father.

37:52.509 --> 37:55.828
It's belonged to my family
for hundreds of years.

37:58.868 --> 38:00.563
It's a wonderful device,

38:01.058 --> 38:02.058
really.

38:02.660 --> 38:03.712
All you have to do

38:03.837 --> 38:06.674
is think of what you want
the other person to remember

38:07.435 --> 38:09.235
and the orb does the rest.

38:12.404 --> 38:14.072
Everything was perfect,

38:15.543 --> 38:18.705
until the man Niles robbed
on the road showed up,

38:18.830 --> 38:20.278
after Niles was

38:20.848 --> 38:21.848
hanged.

38:22.414 --> 38:23.475
And then you

38:24.717 --> 38:26.698
kept asking questions.

38:30.296 --> 38:32.935
With a Confessor around,
I knew I'd never be safe.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.050
So I tried to kill you.

38:36.651 --> 38:39.791
And with the Seeker tracking me,
I knew I had to cover my tracks.

38:40.061 --> 38:41.859
I ran straight to Luna's.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.033
Don't hurt me.

39:04.492 --> 39:06.551
So you're the one
who knocked me out?

39:07.765 --> 39:10.919
I put the memory of Luna's murder
into your head.

39:11.289 --> 39:13.908
It seemed like the best plan
at the time.

39:14.921 --> 39:16.319
What I didn't count on

39:16.444 --> 39:19.206
was the Confessor fighting
for your innocence.

39:20.732 --> 39:24.132
That's when I gave Nella
the memories of everything I did.

39:26.669 --> 39:28.490
To make her the mastermind.

39:29.357 --> 39:31.576
So Conor and Luna were never lovers?

39:32.025 --> 39:33.958
I wrote that letter myself.

39:34.764 --> 39:38.768
I knew the hermit had the power
to restore burned objects.

39:39.828 --> 39:42.769
It's a trick he performs
at children's parties.

39:43.793 --> 39:45.643
Did you kill the other two?

39:45.768 --> 39:47.857
The suicide, and the accident?

39:51.640 --> 39:52.790
Both of them.

39:54.181 --> 39:57.120
I see the error of my ways now,
Confessor.

39:58.734 --> 40:02.597
I only hope you allow me
to atone by serving your will

40:03.887 --> 40:05.777
for the rest of my days.

40:08.162 --> 40:09.162
My will

40:09.718 --> 40:11.677
is that you die by nightfall.

40:19.586 --> 40:21.752
But by then,
you'd better be a long way from here.

40:23.043 --> 40:26.693
I sent word to the D'Harans
that the Seeker was in East Marwen.

40:27.486 --> 40:31.045
They're on their way
from Fort Naramond, to take the Seeker.

40:32.253 --> 40:34.143
They'll be here by sundown.

40:35.654 --> 40:36.804
We should go.

40:38.730 --> 40:41.080
There's still one thing
I need to do.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.231
It wasn't your fault.

40:43.576 --> 40:45.416
Declan had us all fooled.

40:48.795 --> 40:51.031
I should have suspected him sooner.

40:52.435 --> 40:54.493
At least you got justice
for my husband.

41:03.496 --> 41:04.896
Anything you need.

41:06.049 --> 41:07.558
Whenever you need it.

41:14.380 --> 41:16.056
A remarkable story.

41:16.298 --> 41:18.058
And a very powerful piece of magic.

41:18.722 --> 41:21.710
I remember killing that woman
as clearly as I'm looking at you now.

41:21.835 --> 41:23.895
No one should have to live
with a memory like that,

41:24.020 --> 41:25.922
except a real killer.

41:27.267 --> 41:30.821
{*If you like, }I could use Azzallel's magic
here to pluck it from your mind.

41:31.640 --> 41:32.906
I'd be very grateful.

41:33.229 --> 41:36.629
Although Richard's probably
not the one who needs it most.

41:37.018 --> 41:39.355
- Would you...?
- Absolutely not.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.183
What I did really happened.

41:46.963 --> 41:48.885
I'm not as infallible as I thought,

41:50.427 --> 41:52.843
and it cost a man's life.
I don't ever want to forget that.

41:55.020 --> 41:57.237
Things were never
this complicated in Westland.

41:57.459 --> 41:59.209
You could always go back.

42:02.788 --> 42:03.907
Not a chance.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.687
On to new pressing matters...

42:10.183 --> 42:12.669
The magical key
to the Crypt of Tavol'Rang.

42:12.794 --> 42:13.844
You got it.

42:15.969 --> 42:17.909
How was the visit with your family?

42:20.427 --> 42:22.622
It was a visit with family.
