WEBVTT

00:10.044 --> 00:13.480
Well, I see Nathan still hasn't
made his mind up about the decor.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.183
Mr. Brooks has a curator
change out the art every month.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.185
He says it fosters
neural plasticity.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.887
I feel more plastic already.

00:20.888 --> 00:23.523
So I compiled the login
information you asked for...

00:23.524 --> 00:25.625
Miss Wu's calendars,
Dropbox, etc.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.195
Great. Let me know
if there's anything else.

00:28.196 --> 00:31.331
I wanna pick up exactly
where Anne left off.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.800
And here's your office.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.769
We'll have that swapped out
this afternoon.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.964 --> 01:05.432
You have a key to that?

01:05.433 --> 01:08.302
No, but I'll get Office Services
to unlock it ASAP.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.829
Trick-or-treat.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.798
Ha-ha. Come on in, old man.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.069
That's a lot of luggage
for one night.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.538
It's a carry-on.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.173
Carry on to what,
the fucking Titanic?

04:34.174 --> 04:36.409
Well, it's everything
I got until,

04:36.410 --> 04:38.144
you know, Crystal takes me back.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.813
Yeah, but you're only gonna
be here for one night,

04:40.814 --> 04:42.515
because that's what
we agreed on.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.751
That's what you said, right?

04:44.685 --> 04:46.386
No, no, no, no, not "".

04:46.387 --> 04:48.087
This can't be a long-term thing.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.956
Get a hotel.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.392
You're one of the richest
motherfuckers I know. Buy a hotel.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.193
It's not gonna be
a long-term thing, okay?

04:54.194 --> 04:55.462
I gotta work some shit out.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.896
Okay, look, I'm running late.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.398
Don't try to sweet talk me,
all right?

04:58.399 --> 04:59.899
Here are the rules.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.534
Everything on the third
shelf of the fridge,

05:01.535 --> 05:03.503
that's my healthy
blood-pressure food.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.671
Don't touch it.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.072
Phone rings, don't answer it.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.907
And no visitors.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.742
Those are the rules, P.

05:09.743 --> 05:13.212
So I got a doctor coming over.
Gonna need someplace private.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.914
What's wrong with his office?

05:14.915 --> 05:18.951
He's coming from San Francisco.
I'd do it at the house, but...

05:18.952 --> 05:21.253
You can't wait a few days
before you get a checkup?

05:21.254 --> 05:23.456
Well...

05:23.457 --> 05:25.025
He's a neurologist.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.402
I'm seeing things again, Bobo.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.105
Fuck you, man.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.411
You're gonna spring that
on me now.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.513
This guy's gonna get
to the bottom of it.

05:46.514 --> 05:50.182
Point is, nobody can know
about this.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.618
You mean, don't tell Crystal.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.686
She finds out,
I never get her back.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.287
We don't have to worry
about that,

05:55.288 --> 05:57.857
because she'll be too busy
starting her new job.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.992
What new job?

06:12.706 --> 06:15.341
You can't be here.
I told Nathan you wouldn't be...

06:15.342 --> 06:16.544
Fuck Nathan.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.115
You took her job?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.117
You're in her office.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.252
He loved her.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.887
What?

06:27.888 --> 06:31.824
These are love letters
to Anne Wu.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.494
"I didn't know what I was
missing until I met you.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.629
"I didn't know there were
more pieces of me

06:36.630 --> 06:39.599
"until I felt how
perfectly we fit.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.633
Love, Doc Woo."

06:40.634 --> 06:42.935
Signed W-O-O.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.471
You get it?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.739
That was her pet name
for our son.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.107
Crys, I know what you're doing.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.241
It wasn't a fling.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.743
He loved her.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.545
And I thought he loved Jocelyn.

06:52.546 --> 06:55.314
He did.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.849
Right.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.251
He loved both of them.
How does someone do that?

06:59.252 --> 07:00.620
- They don't.
- You do.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.490
I thought I did.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.159
Get this through your head.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.962
I haven't seen Tessie in months,
and I have no plan to.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.499
I love you...

07:12.500 --> 07:14.767
and only you,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.936
and I don't wanna see you
torturing yourself.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.939
I don't give a shit
about your girlfriend.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.008
I want answers.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.612
PJ is dead. That's what we get.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.715
- You gotta stop this.
- Did you stop?

07:28.716 --> 07:32.351
When people asked you to stop,
did you stop?

07:32.352 --> 07:34.153
No.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.655
And it cost me everything.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.824
She stole from PJ.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.826
She had his wife raped,

07:39.827 --> 07:42.695
off of that fucking software,
Bathwater.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.430
What if I can find it?

07:44.431 --> 07:46.071
Well, it's not gonna change
what happened.

07:52.873 --> 07:57.276
We can move on from this,
but we gotta do it together.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.780
Pernell, you need to get it
into your fucking head

08:00.781 --> 08:05.185
that we will never do anything
together ever again.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.556
Get the fuck out.

08:48.261 --> 08:52.131
You been here a while?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.167
Two days.

08:56.303 --> 08:59.672
We just got here last night.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.140
People never seem to get sick

09:01.141 --> 09:02.610
during regular business hours?

09:06.079 --> 09:09.048
- Who's sick?
- My mom.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.450
She has a...

09:11.451 --> 09:12.785
um...

09:12.786 --> 09:15.387
perforated abdominal viscous,

09:15.388 --> 09:18.124
apparently.

09:18.125 --> 09:18.959
You?

09:18.960 --> 09:22.294
My, um...

09:22.295 --> 09:23.630
My congregant.

09:23.631 --> 09:26.365
You're a minister?

09:26.366 --> 09:29.736
- She got shot.
- My God.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.337
She's pregnant.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.640
Is she okay?

09:33.641 --> 09:36.644
Mr. Curtis?

09:59.299 --> 10:02.368
- What's wrong?
- Zach...

10:02.369 --> 10:05.437
They said I lost too much blood.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.674
They couldn't save him.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.977
They couldn't save the baby.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.690
I appreciate you
taking me on, Doc.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.958
Could use some good news
right about now.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.960
Yeah, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.296
I haven't decided
to be your doctor yet.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.464
You came all this way
just to say maybe?

10:32.465 --> 10:38.738
No. I also visited with...
What's his name, Dr. Williams?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.139
He said that
you're seeing things.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.574
But your MRI shows
no brain swelling,

10:42.575 --> 10:44.777
no growths, no thyroid issues.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.746
Have you ever wanted
to cut yourself open

10:46.747 --> 10:50.649
to remove the insects that were
crawling around under your skin?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.785
- No.
- Okay.

10:52.786 --> 10:56.022
So then it's not Ekbom Syndrome.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.690
There's the writing thing.

10:57.691 --> 11:01.060
The only time you can't
control what you write

11:01.061 --> 11:03.195
is when you use
that special pen.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.164
When did this start?

11:05.165 --> 11:08.067
About a week ago.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.738
Anything happen recently that
might have triggered all this?

11:12.605 --> 11:15.474
You're aware I can read, right?

11:15.475 --> 11:18.745
I already know that
you're on trial for murder.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.346
I know about your son, too.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.049
So if you're not gonna be
upfront with me,

11:23.050 --> 11:24.751
then I'm going to get bored,

11:24.752 --> 11:26.753
and then I'm going to leave.

11:26.754 --> 11:30.823
The thing all started
with my son.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.760
That's when the
hallucinations kicked in.

11:33.761 --> 11:36.495
But they went away
after he died.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.131
And then I found his pen.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.867
And then they started again.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.770
But thisis not psychological,
Doc. This is something else.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.671
Okay.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.040
Let me look at the pen.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.817
Write your name.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.097
"Sweet panic." What is that?

12:11.098 --> 12:13.632
I've never seen
those words before.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.567
Okay. Do me a favor.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.970
Look up.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.507
Hold straight.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.876
Okay, good.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.211
Good job.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.915
Okay. Why don't you try again?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.296
What the...

12:45.332 --> 12:48.368
I tried this a thousand times.
It never happened before.

12:52.505 --> 12:56.275
- That's a dirty fucking trick.
- I call it an experiment.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.979
What this experiment shows me
is that you're not faking it.

12:59.980 --> 13:03.715
There is something going on
inside your head.

13:03.716 --> 13:04.716
Can you fix it?

13:04.717 --> 13:07.553
- Maybe.
- Wait a second.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.988
Where are you going, Doc?

13:08.989 --> 13:10.689
I just proved here there's
something wrong with me.

13:10.690 --> 13:11.924
I need to get supplies.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.726
Well, how long's
that gonna take?

13:14.727 --> 13:17.063
Well, it's about
a two-hour drive.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.998
I'm kind of hungry,
so I'm gonna have dinner.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.034
And then I'm gonna sleep
for seven to eight hours.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.036
Doc, this can't wait
till tomorrow.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.873
- Are you suicidal?
- No.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.141
Then it can wait.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.615
Hey, Dude! How many times?
You can't sit here.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.783
I'm with Duck Dynasty.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.586
Excuse me. Thank you.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.355
Here you go.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.327
I'm gonna pray
to St. Anthony now.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.299
Dear St. Anthony,
please come around.

13:53.300 --> 13:57.669
There's something that's lost
and cannot be found.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.906
I gotta do it twice.

14:00.908 --> 14:04.043
Dear St. Anthony,
please come around.

14:04.044 --> 14:08.780
Something is lost
and cannot be found.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.617
My capsule.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.826
He does that every day,
same time.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.395
- How's that?
- The balcony man.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.932
Comes out every day
same time with his phone.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.367
Anyway.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.636
Now, we wait for St. Anthony.

14:30.637 --> 14:31.803
To do what?

14:31.804 --> 14:34.007
To find my capsule.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.365
Let's make this quick.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.234
I can do it.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.271
Do what?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.839
I now where he is.
I know his routine.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.509
I can make him quiet.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.213
I thought I said I didn't want
anybody else getting hurt.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.516
You also said, if he tells...

15:21.154 --> 15:23.090
Towels are done.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.597
You said if he tells
the jury whathe saw,

15:31.598 --> 15:32.831
you go away for good.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.533
Yeah, well, maybe I should.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.868
Even though I didn't kill
Shane Caldwell,

15:36.869 --> 15:38.337
it doesn't mean I'm not guilty.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.706
No, Shane is the guilty one.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.674
Mike Alcala isn't.

15:42.675 --> 15:46.078
No, but he's being used by
the devil to bring you down.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.014
Is that what they call
telling the truth these days?

15:48.015 --> 15:49.581
Let it go.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.717
Trial is still a few weeks out.
We'll find another way.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.586
- This is the other way.
- What if you're wrong?

15:54.587 --> 15:57.623
Just for one second, entertain
the idea that I'm not anointed.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.526
I did that already. I've
never stopped regretting it.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.762
Fine. If I'm your Solomon,
listen to me.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.066
Do not fucking hurt that man.

16:26.253 --> 16:29.688
- Ariella?
- Yes, Mrs. Harris.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.957
I have a email here. I don't
know the password for it.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.359
I thought maybe you might.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.862
Well, that's
Ms. Wu's personal email.

16:36.863 --> 16:40.066
You're telling me you worked for her for
over a year, you don't know her password?

16:40.067 --> 16:42.801
Should I know your passwords?

16:42.802 --> 16:46.073
Thank you.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.359
Hey, wanna take a break?

17:08.361 --> 17:12.098
I wish I could, but I have
to go do a favor for a friend.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.101
But I'll be back
like three or so.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.968
We're right on schedule.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.405
- You ever have Melvin's?
- No.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.440
Best barbecue in the Bay Area.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.009
- You can have it for later.
- Okay.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.011
Thank you. It smells real nice.

17:26.012 --> 17:29.615
Don't thank me yet.
It's kind of a bribe.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.716
Okay.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.121
This first piece is
a bit of a secret.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.491
I'm having a baby.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.195
Yeah.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.131
You don't look like it.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.834
It's in there. Trust me.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.937
What do you need?

17:51.938 --> 17:54.573
I wanna raise it right...

17:54.574 --> 17:55.808
in a house.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.278
This house.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.580
It has a huge backyard,

18:01.581 --> 18:03.415
a big patio.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.251
It's the kind of place

18:05.252 --> 18:07.986
I've been dreaming about
since I was little.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.721
It's real nice, Miss.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.624
Well, the only problem
are the owners.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.260
They want it to go to a family.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.762
You're gonna be a family.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.531
Well, the Realtors
made it very clear,

18:19.532 --> 18:21.867
the only kind of family
these people understand

18:21.868 --> 18:23.969
is the mommy and daddy kind.

18:23.970 --> 18:27.306
I'm hoping
you could help me out.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.441
I don't know.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.244
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.812
I told you it was crazy.

18:33.813 --> 18:37.516
No one's gonna believe
you and me are married.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.186
Why not?

18:40.187 --> 18:42.788
Look at me. I'm not fancy.

18:42.789 --> 18:46.392
Stop it. I'm sure
you clean up very well.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.261
We don't talk the same.
I don't know much about you.

18:49.262 --> 18:52.431
At this point, you know more about
me than any other man in my life.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.333
There's so many houses.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.302
What if you just kept looking?

18:56.303 --> 18:57.736
Why should I have to?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.905
I have the money.
I have a family.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.273
Why not me?

19:01.274 --> 19:03.643
No, I'm sorry. That's not...

19:05.345 --> 19:08.714
You know what? It's fine.
I'm not mad, not at you.

19:08.715 --> 19:12.319
I'm just tired of taking no
for an answer.

19:13.286 --> 19:16.121
Don't let those ribs get cold.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.857
You'd do all the talking?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.935
- Hey. You're up.
- Yeah.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.570
I hit seven vending machines,

19:31.571 --> 19:32.971
none of them had
Sour Patch Kids.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.774
But these are Sour Zachs.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.877
Bootleg, but I'll take them.
Thank you.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.814
How long do you think
until they let me go home?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.650
I don't think
we should rush anything.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.751
Why not?

19:45.752 --> 19:48.086
- Because you got shot.
- Grazed.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.155
- It's not that serious.
- Serious enough to make you...

19:50.156 --> 19:51.791
I don't wanna talk about that.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.303
You don't have to put on
a brave face for me.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.240
You don't have to pretend
you're upset about this.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.810
I wanted this baby.

20:11.811 --> 20:16.081
- I wanted to raise...
- I don't want to talk about that, Paul.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.983
I want to talk about this gift.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.051
Because that's what this is.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.489
This is a chance to go back
to the way that things we're,

20:23.490 --> 20:26.224
before the baby,
before Flock Block,

20:26.225 --> 20:28.294
before Pernell Harris.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.061
How are we feeling, Alicia?

20:30.062 --> 20:31.430
Much better. How are you?

20:31.431 --> 20:33.432
Good. And who's this?

20:33.433 --> 20:35.200
This is Reverend Paul.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.803
He just came to check in on me.
Thank you.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.339
Again, Reverend,
please tell everyone

20:40.340 --> 20:42.575
how much I appreciate
their prayers.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.648
Of course, Sister Alicia.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.754
Okay, take a deep breath.

20:57.490 --> 21:01.360
Okay, so this is just
a sedative.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.462
All right?
Nothing to be scared about.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.331
So what's supposed to happen?

21:05.332 --> 21:10.502
Well, the conscious part of your
brain wants to write your name.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.571
But I think there's
another part of your brain

21:12.572 --> 21:14.606
that wants to write
something else.

21:14.607 --> 21:18.209
And that part is controlling
your hand.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.145
So what I'm hoping is

21:20.146 --> 21:24.350
that this will help us find out

21:24.351 --> 21:26.685
what it's trying to say.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.354
All right?

21:28.355 --> 21:30.356
So just relax.

21:30.357 --> 21:33.559
Deep breath in.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.662
Long breath out.

21:36.663 --> 21:39.865
Deep breath in.

21:39.866 --> 21:44.870
Long breath out.

21:44.871 --> 21:48.139
Deep breath in.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.543
Long breath out.

21:58.385 --> 22:03.856
And now for our host,
Dave Rumio!

22:09.729 --> 22:12.398
Hey, hey, hey, everyone,
thank you for joining us

22:12.399 --> 22:13.765
for another episode of...

22:13.766 --> 22:15.867
Follow Your Path!

22:15.868 --> 22:19.237
Yes!

22:19.238 --> 22:21.473
And how about a big round
of applause for our contestant

22:21.474 --> 22:23.809
for the rest of eternity...

22:23.810 --> 22:26.479
the Honorable
Judge Pernell Harris!

22:28.448 --> 22:29.748
Doc, wake me up.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.651
Doc Olonari,
wake me the fuck up.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.556
You're not real.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.525
You're not fucking real.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.128
I sure felt real in that jail
cell last week.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.599
Boom! Boom!

22:47.767 --> 22:50.969
Who's ready to get started?

22:50.970 --> 22:55.206
Spin for sin! Spin for sin!

22:55.207 --> 22:58.510
Okay, the first lucky
contestant is going to be...

22:58.511 --> 23:01.913
Round and round it goes.
Round and round.

23:01.914 --> 23:04.484
- It's time for me! Come on, Bobo!
- Yes!

23:15.027 --> 23:17.597
This is the greatest day
of my life.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.235
Now, Keith, this is
the golden rope to riches.

23:24.704 --> 23:28.039
Pernell, God has been
trying his darndest

23:28.040 --> 23:29.575
to show you the path.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.477
But for some reason,
you just won't listen.

23:31.478 --> 23:34.980
So we have gathered all
of your friends and family,

23:34.981 --> 23:38.917
or what's left of them...

23:38.918 --> 23:42.220
to show you that,
if you choose the wrong path,

23:42.221 --> 23:46.492
you will be walking it alone.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.160
No!

24:08.080 --> 24:11.950
Spin for sin! Spin for sin!

24:11.951 --> 24:15.386
Spin for sin! Spin for sin!

24:15.387 --> 24:17.889
Spin for sin! Spin for sin!

24:17.890 --> 24:20.159
Spin for sin!

24:23.195 --> 24:25.397
Which wife are you
gonna choose, Pernell?

24:27.433 --> 24:29.602
I won't choose.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.572
I'll make it easy on you.
Alphabetical order.

24:33.573 --> 24:37.710
Ladies and gentlemen,
the lovely Crystal Harris!

24:45.552 --> 24:47.686
Stop!

24:47.687 --> 24:50.622
Okay, Pernell,
are you ready to...

24:50.623 --> 24:52.791
Follow your path!

24:52.792 --> 24:55.393
Follow your path!

24:55.394 --> 24:57.328
There is no path!

24:57.329 --> 24:59.365
There is no God!

25:02.001 --> 25:03.334
How could you be so sure?

25:03.335 --> 25:05.237
Because I did everything
He asked!

25:08.374 --> 25:09.842
And PJ still died.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.798
It's only one way
to be sure if God exists.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.679
Follow me, Dad.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.389
Can you hear me?

25:58.390 --> 26:01.260
Pernell, are you okay?

26:03.029 --> 26:04.230
Are you?

26:07.466 --> 26:09.768
I thought you said
that was just a sedative.

26:09.769 --> 26:12.003
- It was.
- Bullshit.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.340
That was...

26:17.376 --> 26:19.044
It's never been that bad before.

26:19.045 --> 26:22.648
Pernell, do you recognize this?

26:22.649 --> 26:24.282
This is what you wrote.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.918
Do you recognize this?

26:31.157 --> 26:35.728
These are the phrases that
you've been writing, aren't hey?

26:39.899 --> 26:42.068
Pernell, what is this?

26:43.970 --> 26:46.839
It's PJ's suicide note.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.387
Hey, wake up.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.922
- Yeah.
- Wake up.

27:03.923 --> 27:07.392
- What?
- I got news.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.260
Hi.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.462
Duck Dynasty.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.964
Where'd you go?

27:12.965 --> 27:15.433
I saw St. Anthony.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.536
What? Shit.

27:18.537 --> 27:21.539
He talked to me. He told me.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.875
He told me where
your capsule is.

27:23.876 --> 27:26.612
What did the coach say?

27:29.716 --> 27:31.382
Hold on a second.

27:31.383 --> 27:34.119
Where is it?

27:34.120 --> 27:36.321
- Just tell me where it is.
- What?

27:36.322 --> 27:38.289
Don't lie to me.
I want my capsule back!

27:38.290 --> 27:40.258
There's some old dude making
some crazy noise.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.728
I'm not leaving till I get it!
Do you hear me?

27:42.729 --> 27:44.195
Man,
he's gonna get himself shot.

27:44.196 --> 27:47.266
I know it's in there!
Get your hands off me!

27:57.576 --> 27:58.844
Hey! Help!

27:58.845 --> 28:01.213
Help! Hey! Help!

28:02.749 --> 28:09.388
Let him go now!

28:13.192 --> 28:17.029
Where the fuck is he?
He's gotta be under.

28:18.765 --> 28:19.898
Where's my capsule?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.432
I wanna know where
my capsule is!

28:21.433 --> 28:23.302
Get out of the way.

28:39.151 --> 28:42.153
Okay, Miss Wu,
now, I just need you to answer

28:42.154 --> 28:43.454
the security questions
you chose.

28:43.455 --> 28:47.492
The first one
is high school mascot.

28:47.493 --> 28:50.796
Um, Yellow Jackets.

28:50.797 --> 28:52.498
And spouse's nickname?

28:54.801 --> 28:57.335
Are you sure?
That must be some mistake.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.805
Maybe something's changed,

28:59.806 --> 29:03.009
but this is the question you chose
when you set up the account last year.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.279
Pernell Harris, Junior?

29:08.280 --> 29:11.017
No. I said spouse's nickname.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.821
Sorry, that's not it, either.

29:16.055 --> 29:19.290
Miss Wu, are you still there?

29:19.291 --> 29:22.593
I can't reset that password unless
I get the correct information.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.831
Doc Woo. Try Doc Woo. W-O-O.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.632
That's it. Great.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.067
I'll reset your account.

29:29.068 --> 29:37.068
Your temporary password
is W0PK1N5.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.980
Now, would you be willing
to take a quick...

30:24.957 --> 30:28.259
- Good. I caught you.
- Hi, Nathan.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.928
Wanted to make sure you're
getting settled in okay.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.097
Yeah, everything's great,
just great.

30:32.098 --> 30:35.266
Good. Glad to hear it.

30:35.267 --> 30:38.103
Went by the security office.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.538
Grabbed this for you.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.874
We pulled it from one
of the surveillance cameras.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.876
Saves time.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.377
You're very photogenic.

30:46.378 --> 30:50.148
- Thank you.
- You wanna grab dinner?

30:50.149 --> 30:52.017
I can help get you up to speed.

30:52.018 --> 30:55.386
You know, I...

30:55.387 --> 30:57.623
I all right have plans,
but thank you.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.273
Come on.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.508
Not now. Come on,
you piece of shit!

31:17.509 --> 31:19.610
Hey. Hey, you okay?

31:19.611 --> 31:23.348
I put my dollar in.
I just want my Hot Cheetos.

31:23.349 --> 31:26.217
- I got some change.
- It's not gonna work.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.319
It's okay. I got it.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.821
- What is it, Cheetos?
- Yeah, number 16.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.124
It's stuck.

31:37.964 --> 31:40.599
- You've got two.
- Thank you.

31:42.501 --> 31:47.038
My mom,
she didn't make it, so...

31:47.039 --> 31:49.240
I'm so sorry.

31:49.241 --> 31:53.111
We stayed up all night praying
that God would make her better,

31:53.112 --> 31:55.846
and just... and just...

31:55.847 --> 31:57.383
God doesn't give a shit.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.189
Yeah.

32:04.190 --> 32:08.359
God almost never lets
people die.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.996
He probably killed your mom,

32:10.997 --> 32:12.263
'cause he's a jerk.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.299
Had nothing to do
with the surgery.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.701
If you're trying to be funny right
now, it's really not working.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.703
You think God maybe
did this because he cares?

32:18.704 --> 32:20.738
My mom just died.

32:20.739 --> 32:22.540
My baby just died.

32:22.541 --> 32:26.177
Yeah, the congregant I told
you about is my girlfriend.

32:26.178 --> 32:30.548
I pretty much ruined her life so
she could help me build my church.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.350
She's good at it, too.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.852
But I always thought she was
just a placeholder, you know?

32:34.853 --> 32:37.255
Then this baby comes along.

32:37.256 --> 32:40.258
And gets in the way
of everything.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.693
If that one little sperm
had just stopped short,

32:42.694 --> 32:45.463
I'd be preaching lies
on TV right now.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.132
And now it's gone.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.900
Now I have a second chance.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.736
What?

32:51.737 --> 32:53.338
You shouldn't be blaming God.

32:53.339 --> 32:54.905
You should be asking yourself,

32:54.906 --> 32:56.541
how can this change you
for the better?

32:56.542 --> 32:59.044
What apathy can your mother's
death shake away?

32:59.045 --> 33:00.778
Because no matter
why God did it,

33:00.779 --> 33:03.448
he's given you a chance
to do something different.

33:03.449 --> 33:06.585
And if you don't take it,
fuck you.

33:11.257 --> 33:16.661
You know, my mom always begged
me to go to church with her.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.763
I never did it.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.432
So now what?

33:36.915 --> 33:40.485
- Where've you been?
- Trying.

33:40.486 --> 33:43.089
You know what, it's fine.
Let's just get in there.

33:46.492 --> 33:49.594
What happened to you?
Are you okay?

33:49.595 --> 33:53.364
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.965
You look like you got hit
by a truck.

33:54.966 --> 33:57.468
- What were you doing?
- Please.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.171
- I'm here.
- My God. This is not happening.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.907
It's okay.
I wanna do this for you.

34:02.908 --> 34:06.010
But you can't, Keith. Not like this.
You can barely stand up.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.478
Why would you even
show up like this?

34:08.480 --> 34:12.750
'Cause I know how important
this house is to you, Miss,

34:12.751 --> 34:14.485
and you asked for my help.

34:14.485 --> 34:17.121
You know what? That's really sweet.
It is, okay?

34:17.123 --> 34:20.190
But I think I'm gonna have a better
chance of doing this on my own, okay?

34:20.192 --> 34:22.460
So just get in your truck
and go home.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.630
I'll tell them you had to work.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.733
I'm sorry, Miss.

34:28.734 --> 34:29.867
Miss Graham!

34:29.868 --> 34:31.636
Mr. and Mrs. Browning!

34:31.637 --> 34:34.205
How are you?

34:34.206 --> 34:35.440
How many kids
did you raise here?

34:35.440 --> 34:37.342
We had four of our own.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.510
And then they had another six
so far.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.580
- Is that blood, Keith?
- It is.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.715
I had an accident at work today.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.453
- What is it you do?
- Construction.

34:48.719 --> 34:52.190
Wow, look at this.
Did you make that?

34:52.190 --> 34:55.592
No, that is my mother's
crib mobile,

34:55.594 --> 34:58.229
handmade by my grandfather.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.765
Wow! And what about
these newer pieces here?

35:00.766 --> 35:04.469
It turned into kind of
a family history since then.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.172
And every time
a new baby is born,

35:07.173 --> 35:08.306
we add a new charm.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.375
I love that.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.477
Keith, we are definitely
doing that for our son.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.346
You're having a boy?

35:15.681 --> 35:17.948
So how many other houses
you two looking at?

35:17.949 --> 35:19.950
We're not.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.888
I now it sounds crazy, but we've
got our hearts set on this house.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.657
You sure this is the kind of
neighborhood you'd want to raise him in?

35:26.658 --> 35:30.461
This is exactly the kind of
place we've always dreamed of.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.197
Yeah?

35:32.198 --> 35:35.766
- That how you feel, Keith?
- Yep.

35:35.767 --> 35:39.670
You understand, though, that
everyone here is traditional...

35:39.671 --> 35:41.439
I mean, nice, but traditional.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.975
And what traditions exactly
are we breaking?

35:44.976 --> 35:48.879
All we're saying is, it's easier
when folks have things in common.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.215
Things like what?

35:50.216 --> 35:52.650
Different kind of people
want different things.

35:52.651 --> 35:56.221
I know that we want to raise
a healthy and happy family,

35:56.222 --> 35:57.522
just like most people.

35:57.523 --> 35:58.856
Is that what you mean?

35:58.857 --> 36:02.693
Yes, and also like values.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.962
Henry and I, for example,

36:04.963 --> 36:06.664
we both grew up in small towns,

36:06.665 --> 36:08.934
and we both went
to the same church.

36:12.404 --> 36:15.906
- Church is where we met.
- Which one?

36:15.907 --> 36:18.343
Hand of God Chapel.

36:18.344 --> 36:22.247
First time I saw
this beautiful young lady,

36:22.248 --> 36:24.749
she was carrying
a stack of bibles.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.618
She dropped one,
and I helped her pick it up,

36:27.619 --> 36:28.753
and...

36:28.754 --> 36:32.523
Have you read 1 Epistles
John 4:7?

36:32.524 --> 36:36.261
"Lovers of God,
and everyone who loveth

36:36.262 --> 36:39.830
is born of God and knoweth God."

36:39.831 --> 36:44.302
I never got that before, but
after I looked into her eyes,

36:44.303 --> 36:47.706
I finally understood
what John was saying.

36:50.542 --> 36:54.979
Please, God, guide the soul
of your humble servant...

36:54.980 --> 36:58.048
- Gladys Tempton.
- Gladys Tempton.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.784
And embrace her in Your glory.

36:59.785 --> 37:03.388
He who hears My word and
believes in Him who sent Me

37:03.389 --> 37:05.323
has everlasting life

37:05.324 --> 37:08.359
and shall not come into judgment

37:08.360 --> 37:12.330
but is passed from death
into life.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.198
Amen.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.934
Amen.

37:21.940 --> 37:26.478
You ever heard of a guy
named Vincent Gigante?

37:28.747 --> 37:31.048
I'm really not
in the mood, Bobo.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.617
But you're in my house,

37:32.618 --> 37:34.552
drinking my expensive scotch,

37:34.553 --> 37:36.887
so you can indulge me.

37:36.888 --> 37:40.090
This dude walks around his
neighborhood in his bathrobe,

37:40.091 --> 37:41.559
mumbling shit to himself,

37:41.560 --> 37:43.694
acting crazy, total nut job.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.464
Well, it turns out,
Gigante was actually running

37:46.465 --> 37:48.198
the Genovese crime family
the whole time.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.000
People called him The Oddfather.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.370
Look, I don't know what the fuck
you're accusing me of now, Bobo,

37:52.371 --> 37:53.771
but I really had
a horrible morning.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.506
Too bad Alcala survived?

37:55.507 --> 37:57.808
Fuck you talking about?
What happened to Alcala?

37:57.809 --> 37:59.444
You gonna keep
bullshitting me with this

37:59.445 --> 38:00.978
"cuckoo for Cocoa Puff" act,
that's fine.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.514
I need to know what
you're gonna tell the cops.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.983
'Cause it's damn sure not gonna be that
you were chilling on the mayor's couch,

38:05.984 --> 38:07.352
while someone tried to kill the
only witness in your murder trial.

38:07.353 --> 38:08.819
That's not gonna happen.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.555
Bobo, you gotta believe me,
I had nothing to do with this.

38:10.556 --> 38:13.792
Yeah, like you had nothing to do
with Shane Caldwell, right?

38:16.094 --> 38:20.966
You're gonna get that doctor to say he
met you somewhere else, you got that?

38:31.610 --> 38:33.712
I'm gonna take care
of this, Bobo.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.084
Yeah, we'll see.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.666
Doctor Tieman said
I can go home tomorrow.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.736
- I heard.
- That's great, right?

38:58.737 --> 39:02.540
I don't wanna pretend
this didn't happen.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.942
Okay, I do.

39:04.943 --> 39:05.911
You're right.

39:05.912 --> 39:07.912
God's giving us a second chance,

39:07.913 --> 39:09.714
but not to make
the same mistakes.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.916
Paul, I do not ask for a lot,
but I need this.

39:11.917 --> 39:14.685
I saved a person's soul today...
A woman.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.455
She lost her faith,
and I counseled her.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.089
I brought her back
into the flock.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.925
That's what I mean.
Let's get back to doing that.

39:20.926 --> 39:23.794
But it was different.
I was honest.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.430
That's what you've always done.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.432
No, I used to tell them
what they wanted to hear,

39:27.433 --> 39:29.534
how to get clean or get rich.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.669
This time I told the truth.

39:31.670 --> 39:34.138
I never would have done that
if it wasn't for what happened.

39:34.139 --> 39:37.509
- Paul...
- I don't wanna go back to who I was.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.516
Fine.

39:45.517 --> 39:48.318
If it helps you, then remember.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.788
But do not talk to me
about it ever.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.457
I need to focus on tomorrow.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.058
Good.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.226
'Cause tomorrow is
gonna be different.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.830
No more sugarcoating.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.634
And no more hiding.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.715
It was on her finger.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.884
A gold engagement ring
with three diamonds on it.

40:19.885 --> 40:23.622
- Well, I can assure you...
- Someone fucking took it!

41:00.391 --> 41:02.828
You've reached Pernell Harris.
Please leave a message.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.731
Hey, um, it's me.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.172
You promised me.

41:16.407 --> 41:18.043
- I know.
- Then why?

41:21.379 --> 41:26.751
Because I promised him

41:26.752 --> 41:29.554
that I would protect you

41:29.555 --> 41:31.890
no matter what.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.061
Well, you just made it worse.

41:50.008 --> 41:52.176
Yeah, thank you for trying.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.177
Okay.

42:17.603 --> 42:20.470
Hey, it's me. Um, listen,

42:20.471 --> 42:21.672
I don't know if I'm gonna...

42:21.673 --> 42:23.674
Or I don't know when I'm gonna

42:23.675 --> 42:26.210
get a chance
to tell you this, so...

42:26.211 --> 42:28.145
I'm sorry.

42:28.146 --> 42:30.915
I'm sorry for what I said
yesterday,

42:30.916 --> 42:34.085
and, yeah, how I said it.

42:35.854 --> 42:39.523
Look, I don't know
how much us I have left in me,

42:39.524 --> 42:42.660
but, um, thank you

42:42.661 --> 42:45.630
for, um...

42:45.631 --> 42:47.264
Yeah, thank you for trying.

42:47.265 --> 42:49.334
Okay.

42:52.838 --> 42:55.173
Hey, it's Crystal.
Leave a message.

43:01.713 --> 43:03.447
Please state your destination.

43:03.448 --> 43:05.650
Bobo's house.

43:05.651 --> 43:07.384
Accident reported ahead.

43:07.385 --> 43:09.154
Calculating alternate route.

43:11.389 --> 43:15.727
Make a U-turn, then in one mile,
turn left on Florno Street.

43:43.054 --> 43:44.989
Traffic detected ahead.

43:44.990 --> 43:47.057
Calculating alternate route.

43:47.058 --> 43:48.558
Again?

43:48.559 --> 43:50.862
In 50 feet, turn left.

44:05.076 --> 44:07.611
- Where's Anne?
- She couldn't make it.

44:07.612 --> 44:10.580
Turn left in 100 feet.

44:10.581 --> 44:12.382
Recalculating.

44:12.383 --> 44:14.584
Are you fucking kidding me?

44:14.585 --> 44:15.786
Fuck's sake.

44:15.787 --> 44:18.088
In 20 feet, take a right.

44:18.089 --> 44:20.358
Just get me
to the fucking highway.

44:23.594 --> 44:25.797
- Who are you?
- A friend.

44:27.265 --> 44:28.799
This is bullshit.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.600
Wait, wait, wait.

44:30.601 --> 44:31.902
Don't fuck...

44:31.903 --> 44:33.938
Holy fuck! You set me up!

44:33.939 --> 44:35.941
No! Wait! I didn't!

44:39.544 --> 44:42.612
Wait!

44:42.613 --> 44:44.249
No! Wait!

44:53.324 --> 44:55.760
Crystal! Crys!

44:55.761 --> 44:56.895
Pernell?

44:58.196 --> 44:59.264
Crys!

45:01.132 --> 45:02.566
God.

45:02.567 --> 45:04.369
What happened?

45:09.474 --> 45:11.409
How did you know I was here?

45:14.045 --> 45:16.514
You have reached
your destination.

45:31.396 --> 45:33.331
Keith.

45:57.055 --> 45:59.523
- Has he spoken to anyone else?
- No, sir.

45:59.524 --> 46:01.091
He's not even in the system yet.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.460
Go get the chief.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.843
I would like to confess to
the murder of Shane Caldwell.
