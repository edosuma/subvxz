WEBVTT

00:01.225 --> 00:02.642
On the day of our birth,

00:02.729 --> 00:04.718
we are each given a name...

00:05.807 --> 00:07.450
A promise of who we are

00:07.537 --> 00:09.695
and all that we may become.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.107
I am Emma.

00:12.443 --> 00:14.318
I was born with a purpose.

00:14.818 --> 00:17.250
You have a purpose.

00:17.652 --> 00:20.517
I... am Hannah.

00:20.677 --> 00:22.789
I was born without a purpose.

00:24.115 --> 00:27.929
Mother placed no expectations
on me other than to survive...

00:28.364 --> 00:29.475
To live.

00:29.562 --> 00:31.333
Oh, God, no.

00:31.519 --> 00:33.050
To learn.

00:33.526 --> 00:36.064
That is all my mother
expected from me...

00:36.151 --> 00:38.112
For my mind to exceed
her own...

00:38.199 --> 00:39.721
Observation,

00:39.808 --> 00:42.659
hypothesis, conclusion.

00:42.746 --> 00:46.029
So that I may help her
fulfill her promise.

00:51.971 --> 00:53.896
I was raised in nature,

00:54.152 --> 00:56.919
looking out upon the stars
and horizons...

00:57.136 --> 00:59.513
The great beauty
of a dead world.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.831
I was raised on the other
side of the glass window,

01:02.918 --> 01:04.912
looking upon the world
of the living,

01:04.998 --> 01:08.708
brought up by elders,
educators, teachers

01:08.871 --> 01:10.802
instead of a mother.

01:11.502 --> 01:13.091
By an extraordinary
sisterhood

01:13.178 --> 01:15.076
who taught me everything.

01:17.082 --> 01:19.630
Strength in place
of compassion.

01:20.401 --> 01:22.713
They taught me science
and temporal mechanics

01:22.800 --> 01:26.581
so that I may one day
learn to break time itself.

01:26.668 --> 01:30.388
We honor time
with patience.

01:30.949 --> 01:32.252
When I was old enough,

01:32.339 --> 01:34.951
I infiltrated
the lives of others.

01:36.199 --> 01:37.872
Brilliant minds.

01:38.496 --> 01:39.800
My mother.

01:40.113 --> 01:41.647
And yet,
for all her brilliance,

01:41.734 --> 01:44.060
her science
poisoned everything.

01:44.907 --> 01:46.408
She built a machine to bend...

01:46.495 --> 01:48.685
To break the natural world.

01:48.806 --> 01:52.393
My only purpose was to learn
how to complete Titan

01:52.480 --> 01:55.474
so that she may have
her Forest of Red.

01:56.470 --> 01:59.208
So that she can stop
a madwoman she calls

01:59.295 --> 02:00.818
the Witness.

02:01.363 --> 02:04.396
And now that my education
is complete,

02:04.913 --> 02:06.213
the end is here.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.326
Are you ready
to earn your place,

02:08.413 --> 02:11.185
to fulfill Titan's
true design?

02:11.570 --> 02:12.832
Yes.

02:13.284 --> 02:15.427
Initiate splinter sequence.

02:15.514 --> 02:17.888
No matter how hard
we fight...

02:20.485 --> 02:23.046
The Witness cannot be stopped.

02:24.874 --> 02:27.329
I'm ready to complete Titan.

02:28.117 --> 02:30.970
Mother has invited me home.

02:31.468 --> 02:33.712
Mother has sent me away.

02:34.205 --> 02:35.689
I am not ready...

02:37.418 --> 02:41.324
I am ready
for a life of certainty.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.973
For a life of doubt.

02:43.060 --> 02:45.832
For what I was made...
to be a daughter.

02:45.919 --> 02:46.931
To be a daughter.

02:47.018 --> 02:48.072
- A daughter.
- Daughter.

02:48.159 --> 02:49.913
- To be a daughter.
- To be a daughter.

02:52.918 --> 02:54.757
For Mother.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.413
For Mother.

03:09.652 --> 03:11.890

03:20.637 --> 03:22.270
Katarina.

03:23.317 --> 03:24.653
Olivia.

03:24.831 --> 03:27.435
You look... well.

03:39.277 --> 03:41.139
I've seen this before...

03:41.707 --> 03:44.944
Neurological deterioration
from temporal radiation.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.527
You're dying.

03:46.614 --> 03:48.811
And you are the Witness,

03:49.450 --> 03:50.988
always were,

03:51.348 --> 03:55.576
and that, in the end,
I think will kill us both.

03:58.984 --> 04:01.022
Is this how you do it?

04:01.551 --> 04:03.264
How you see?

04:05.753 --> 04:08.608
Jack your consciousness
into the time stream?

04:08.856 --> 04:11.685
You must be pretty desperate,

04:11.839 --> 04:13.215
because, let's face it,

04:13.302 --> 04:16.185
nothing beats the real thing.

04:17.238 --> 04:19.190
I'm sure you've heard by now.

04:19.403 --> 04:22.248
Primaries...
True Seers...

04:22.348 --> 04:24.733
Have built a weapon
to destroy you.

04:25.402 --> 04:27.365
They call you a demon.

04:27.942 --> 04:29.701
Where is it?

04:31.563 --> 04:33.467
When is it?

04:36.012 --> 04:40.389
And you call yourself
the Witness?

04:44.334 --> 04:46.233
You made a mistake

04:46.597 --> 04:48.342
bringing me here...

04:49.129 --> 04:52.686
Took the one from whom
there's nothing left to take.

04:52.918 --> 04:56.912
Maybe there's nothing more
I can take from your body.

05:09.594 --> 05:11.694
But from here, Katarina...

05:13.754 --> 05:15.706
I can take everything.

05:22.547 --> 05:24.011
This is not a plan.

05:24.098 --> 05:24.989
This is insane.

05:25.076 --> 05:26.332
It's what has to happen.

05:26.419 --> 05:27.642
Elliot's drive,
it gives us

05:27.729 --> 05:29.030
the signature
for Titan, right?

05:29.117 --> 05:30.892
We splinter there, find Jones,
bring her back.

05:30.979 --> 05:33.282
Titan is massive!

05:33.369 --> 05:35.292
Who knows where
she's being kept?

05:35.379 --> 05:38.714
Besides, this machine won't have
that kind of precision.

05:38.801 --> 05:40.120
Then fix the goddamn
splinter suit.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.245
I am working on it
as fast as I can.

05:42.332 --> 05:44.183
Athan's suit was shot to hell.

05:44.270 --> 05:46.701
- Work faster.
- We are at a stalemate.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.597
We cannot get to 1491.

05:48.684 --> 05:50.787
It's too far back
without a beacon,

05:51.011 --> 05:54.264
without an anchor
of some kind to lock on to.

05:54.553 --> 05:56.050
So what are we
supposed to do?

05:56.137 --> 05:57.645
Trust her.

05:59.604 --> 06:01.147
We trust Jones.

06:19.418 --> 06:20.529
What's wrong?

06:20.715 --> 06:22.998
This is where they kept me.

06:23.847 --> 06:26.030
Back of the cell is warmer.

06:26.596 --> 06:28.748
Just think
of something you hate.

06:29.052 --> 06:30.545
It'll keep you going.

06:30.668 --> 06:33.733
If I'm going out, Mr. Deacon,

06:34.123 --> 06:36.066
I prefer it while thinking

06:36.153 --> 06:38.006
of something I love.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.063
How long must I be gone?

06:52.246 --> 06:55.167
Long enough to understand
and to experience

06:55.254 --> 06:57.647
all those things
which make up a life.

06:57.825 --> 06:59.581
Don't ask this of me,

06:59.668 --> 07:00.715
not now.

07:00.819 --> 07:02.153
Hannah,

07:03.168 --> 07:06.331
this envelope...
It's not a directive.

07:06.418 --> 07:08.811
It's rather
a mission of choice,

07:08.995 --> 07:10.753
to be opened
only on this date

07:10.840 --> 07:13.613
and...
only after you truly know

07:13.700 --> 07:16.045
what I've asked you
to fight for.

07:16.663 --> 07:18.686
I cannot leave you like this.

07:20.785 --> 07:23.373
Please, Hannah,

07:23.643 --> 07:25.379
you must.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.856
Is Titan yet complete?

08:04.558 --> 08:05.815
Nearly.

08:06.409 --> 08:09.645
Unfortunately, the towers
were meant to transport,

08:09.732 --> 08:10.869
not transpose.

08:10.956 --> 08:13.130
Calculations take time.

08:13.228 --> 08:15.083
We'll be ready to test shortly.

08:22.682 --> 08:24.966
How are you
finding the future?

08:25.815 --> 08:28.989
At night, it's... darker

08:29.104 --> 08:30.630
than I imagined.

08:31.038 --> 08:32.104
Quieter.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.339
Without distraction.

08:35.738 --> 08:38.163
Perhaps your box was too big.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.659
No, not at all.

08:40.746 --> 08:42.530
I was glad for it.

08:42.630 --> 08:45.567
You were made to think,
not feel.

08:45.896 --> 08:47.255
Of course.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.159
Finish it.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.498
I hope you've rested.

09:47.724 --> 09:49.806
You'll need your strength.

09:53.087 --> 09:56.073
You see, I've found
new ways to travel,

09:56.392 --> 09:59.050
to see beyond
the edges of time,

09:59.517 --> 10:03.753
further and more powerful
than any Primary.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.261
I have witnessed,

10:08.399 --> 10:10.268
but not everything.

10:20.869 --> 10:23.792
The rest I will take
from your mind.

10:28.998 --> 10:32.603
Now, where is the weapon?

11:00.666 --> 11:03.190
You're quite formidable.

11:03.457 --> 11:04.898
Your mind is a maze.

11:04.985 --> 11:07.440
But I'll make my way through.

11:07.578 --> 11:10.690
I'd temper your certainty.

11:34.981 --> 11:36.845
What are you doing here?

11:37.183 --> 11:38.787
I would've thought
that'd be obvious.

11:38.874 --> 11:41.342
Dr. Adler repaired the suit?

11:41.582 --> 11:42.911
How?

11:43.231 --> 11:45.175
Ask him yourself
when we get home.

11:45.262 --> 11:47.170
It was foolish
of you to come here,

11:47.257 --> 11:49.823
risk yourself
for a dying woman.

11:49.993 --> 11:51.210
This is not what I...

11:51.297 --> 11:53.537
Did you really think we were
just gonna leave you here?

11:53.633 --> 11:54.997
You don't get
to fall on that sword.

11:55.084 --> 11:56.510
We need it for her.

11:56.597 --> 11:57.672
Deacon...

11:57.819 --> 12:00.455
We can't leave him behind,
not again.

12:00.542 --> 12:03.221
He was instrumental
in helping us.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.448
There's no time.

12:05.821 --> 12:09.015
Deacon is nothing
if not monumentally resilient.

12:09.102 --> 12:12.035
He can take care of himself...
for now.

12:15.655 --> 12:16.818
You all right?

12:16.905 --> 12:18.797
The usual symptoms...

12:19.295 --> 12:22.297
Trembling hands,
blurry vision.

12:22.438 --> 12:24.374
But now...

12:26.014 --> 12:28.250
some odd lapses in...

12:28.337 --> 12:29.811
time.

12:32.193 --> 12:34.672
The neurological symptoms
are worsening.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.267
What did you
experience in Titan?

12:37.460 --> 12:38.704
What did you see?

12:38.808 --> 12:41.891
She tried to worm her way
inside my head.

12:42.085 --> 12:44.477
I think she was attempting
what she once did to you.

12:44.749 --> 12:46.633
She made me see things.

12:46.797 --> 12:48.586
Sabotage the machine.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.522
Sam.

12:50.864 --> 12:52.657
Did you tell them anything

12:52.779 --> 12:54.352
about the mission?

12:54.844 --> 12:56.524
About the bell?

12:57.522 --> 12:58.796
No.

12:59.053 --> 13:01.998
You came for me
before I had the chance.

13:14.983 --> 13:18.384
Climb the steps.
Ring the bell.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.802
We have the bell,
gotta find the steps.

13:23.124 --> 13:25.334
Yes, that would be simpler
if we knew

13:25.421 --> 13:29.087
what kind of weapon
the Primaries had constructed.

13:29.382 --> 13:33.477
This story is frustratingly
nonspecific.

13:33.968 --> 13:35.639
"There once was a serpent

13:35.726 --> 13:37.946
"who only traveled
in one direction.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.595
"Always forward,
never backward.

13:40.718 --> 13:44.084
Until one day,
the serpent came upon a demon."

13:49.655 --> 13:51.928
"The demon
cursed the serpent,

13:52.015 --> 13:53.790
"driving him insane,

13:54.015 --> 13:56.204
"causing him
to eat his own tail.

13:56.295 --> 13:59.727
"The serpent was blind, but
there were those who could see,

13:59.814 --> 14:03.540
"some who were seers who knew
the serpent's true path,

14:03.627 --> 14:07.454
"so they created a weapon
to destroy the demon."

14:08.830 --> 14:10.587
Why a demon, do you think?

14:10.812 --> 14:14.201
Well, it's an apt description
of a monstrous opponent.

14:14.343 --> 14:17.001
Olivia has become
something else...

14:17.088 --> 14:19.532
Something far less than human.

14:19.673 --> 14:20.827
Mother?

14:25.741 --> 14:28.128
Hannah,
w-what are you...

14:30.430 --> 14:32.207
I sent you away.

14:32.347 --> 14:33.594
I returned

14:33.730 --> 14:35.435
to help you find the weapon,

14:35.558 --> 14:36.699
together.

14:36.980 --> 14:39.404
Isn't that what daughters
are made to do?

14:39.613 --> 14:41.552
Serve their mothers?

14:43.065 --> 14:44.125
Isn't that what daughters

14:44.212 --> 14:45.654
are made to do?

14:46.151 --> 14:48.115
Serve their mothers?

14:54.902 --> 14:57.716
"They hid the weapon
in the snake's den...

14:57.824 --> 15:00.747
"where it waited
for its madness to end.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.597
"But it never did.

15:02.792 --> 15:05.041
"Then the Seers discovered
that the only one who could

15:05.128 --> 15:07.560
"wield the weapon
was the demon itself.

15:07.949 --> 15:11.258
"So the serpent was doomed
to circle in madness...

15:11.433 --> 15:13.152
forever."

15:26.764 --> 15:28.417
Nice try.

15:31.691 --> 15:33.310
Where are you going?

15:33.524 --> 15:36.302
I imagine if you can
get into my head,

15:36.542 --> 15:38.981
I can find my way into yours.

16:23.293 --> 16:25.138
You have a brilliant mind.

16:25.254 --> 16:27.995
I can't imagine
how it must feel to lose control of it.

16:28.082 --> 16:33.334
If my mind, if my life,
was the price of yours...

16:33.564 --> 16:36.231
I'd happily pay it.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.085
Your body may be
too weak, Katarina,

16:39.172 --> 16:41.130
your mind too strong,

16:41.433 --> 16:44.264
but the mind and body
of your Hannah?

16:44.449 --> 16:48.170
What wouldn't you confess
to protect that?

16:48.816 --> 16:52.326
Your daughter has always
been your best,

16:52.613 --> 16:55.342
most exploitable weakness.

17:02.971 --> 17:05.391
Mother,
it's been a year

17:05.478 --> 17:09.584
since I left to live
in your world, your past.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.964
Here they have
everything, always,

17:13.050 --> 17:14.646
and somehow see nothing.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.787
Music, film, art, each other.

17:18.089 --> 17:21.451
The world's so full
and the people so empty.

17:22.271 --> 17:25.518
This place, this time,
seems much too...

17:25.605 --> 17:30.115
Lifeless, too sterile,
not at all what I imagined.

17:30.363 --> 17:34.042
Its hallways haunted,
its rhythms a clockwork,

17:34.129 --> 17:36.685
its subjects
too full of feeling.

17:37.165 --> 17:39.584
Distracted
by their possessions.

17:40.697 --> 17:43.287
Devoted to their obsessions.

17:44.269 --> 17:46.724
They lose themselves
in imagery.

17:47.473 --> 17:49.238
In memory.

17:50.785 --> 17:52.003
Missing the present

17:52.090 --> 17:53.763
as it happens around them.

17:53.850 --> 17:57.146
Trapped in a past
that they hope to regain.

17:57.629 --> 17:59.888
Yet somehow
I belong to it.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.240
I belong to it.

18:03.004 --> 18:04.646
Was born of it.

18:05.269 --> 18:07.185
Was born for it.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.026
Was created
to make it whole even if...

18:10.113 --> 18:12.373
Now I can't quite see.

18:13.519 --> 18:15.334
For Mother.

18:17.105 --> 18:18.469
For Mother.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.084
For Mother.

18:21.254 --> 18:22.370
Looks like
you got that whole

18:22.457 --> 18:23.995
lost-in-thought thing
happening.

18:24.082 --> 18:25.573
Too good-looking for a beer,

18:25.660 --> 18:27.196
too rough-and-tumble
for a cocktail,

18:27.283 --> 18:29.240
so... here.

18:39.531 --> 18:40.737
First Scotch?

18:40.824 --> 18:42.479
First a lot of things
these days.

18:42.566 --> 18:44.714
Well, that's the first
I'm even hearing you talk,

18:44.801 --> 18:46.506
so that's progress.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.955
You're not the small-town type.
I can tell that.

18:52.042 --> 18:53.745
Big city, bright lights
isn't your thing.

18:53.832 --> 18:55.024
Your eyes give that away.

18:55.111 --> 18:56.526
There's too much life in there,

18:56.613 --> 18:58.162
like you seen some shit.

18:59.010 --> 19:01.526
Like a soldier, maybe?
Military?

19:01.613 --> 19:03.709
Been away,
can't quite get back?

19:04.926 --> 19:07.318
Yes, something like that.

19:11.823 --> 19:13.387
I'm Bryan.

19:14.339 --> 19:15.777
Hannah.

19:22.574 --> 19:24.315
If Primaries have created

19:24.402 --> 19:26.995
a weapon for your enemies,
it is to be feared.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.490
Not to be uncovered
but to be unmade.

19:30.691 --> 19:33.190
Without Titan,
you have no weapons

19:33.277 --> 19:35.506
with which to defend yourself.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.935
- Mother.
- Show me.

19:44.035 --> 19:45.659
It's not ready.

19:45.746 --> 19:48.317
I want to see...
now.

19:57.777 --> 20:01.425
The central spire must key in
at the very same moment,

20:01.512 --> 20:04.237
repeating, drawing temporal
radiation on top of itself,

20:04.324 --> 20:05.526
where it should,

20:05.613 --> 20:08.159
in theory, be overlaid.

20:08.246 --> 20:10.638
A paradox made of time itself.

20:41.776 --> 20:45.059
We must be patient, Mother.

20:46.723 --> 20:47.902
Mother?

20:49.324 --> 20:51.263
I have no daughter,

20:51.551 --> 20:54.873
only a piece of myself
to be where I cannot.

20:57.629 --> 21:00.001
I built you
to achieve great heights,

21:00.088 --> 21:01.428
not fall from them.

21:04.582 --> 21:06.232
Finish Titan.

21:15.205 --> 21:17.029
Bring me Jones.

21:33.734 --> 21:40.103
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

21:40.330 --> 21:42.673
♪ Ah, ah ♪

21:47.834 --> 21:49.193
Hey.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.780
You got plans tonight?

21:52.123 --> 21:54.336
There was something
I was supposed to do...

21:54.545 --> 21:56.617
Am supposed to do.

21:57.123 --> 21:59.840
Something I thought
I wanted to be done with,

21:59.927 --> 22:01.412
but now...

22:03.739 --> 22:05.365
Well, um,

22:06.185 --> 22:08.531
I was thinking 
you and I could do something.

22:09.115 --> 22:10.758
You mean like...

22:13.092 --> 22:14.547
I don't know.

22:14.825 --> 22:16.762
Okay, rejection,
I can take it.

22:16.849 --> 22:18.432
- No...
- No, no, I can take it. I can take it.

22:18.519 --> 22:20.086
No, no, I...

22:20.732 --> 22:22.242
I'd love that.

22:22.435 --> 22:28.781
<i>♪ I will shiver
the whole night through ♪</i>

22:29.256 --> 22:30.732
Hannah?

22:31.717 --> 22:33.624
We both know
this isn't real.

22:33.711 --> 22:38.401
But when has anything ever
needed to be real to be true?

22:39.076 --> 22:40.414
Mother, please.

22:40.842 --> 22:42.240
Olivia,

22:42.669 --> 22:45.263
whatever you think
there is to gain from this...

22:45.350 --> 22:48.145
You splintered me
time and again, Katarina.

22:48.232 --> 22:51.108
Broke me into pieces
and then made me whole.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.187
Your daughter stopped you then.

22:53.326 --> 22:55.086
Who will stop me now?

22:56.711 --> 22:58.045
Olivia!

22:58.152 --> 22:59.287
No!

23:17.957 --> 23:19.293
Christ.

23:24.775 --> 23:26.478
Hannah!

23:27.689 --> 23:28.849
Katarina.

23:37.169 --> 23:38.649
Hannah!

23:43.619 --> 23:45.057
Hannah!

23:45.643 --> 23:48.106
Meine liebe.

23:48.987 --> 23:50.996
My daughter.

23:51.181 --> 23:53.265
Please forgive me.

23:57.424 --> 23:59.481
You can stop this.

24:00.745 --> 24:02.431
Just tell me
where your Primaries

24:02.518 --> 24:03.903
have built your weapon.

24:05.587 --> 24:07.424
England.

24:08.019 --> 24:09.512
Hertfordshire.

24:09.901 --> 24:11.846
1491.

24:12.423 --> 24:14.701
Please stop this.

24:15.573 --> 24:17.966
Just be done with it.

24:23.761 --> 24:26.810
Prepare Titan
for the jump to 1491.

24:27.972 --> 24:29.475
Find me Emma.

24:34.713 --> 24:36.470
What the hell
did she do to you?

24:36.557 --> 24:38.139
What I deserved
and

24:38.226 --> 24:40.598
- what I needed her to.
- Come on.

24:43.994 --> 24:46.355
Titan's splintering.

24:46.792 --> 24:48.431
It worked.

25:06.647 --> 25:07.865
What is it?

25:07.952 --> 25:09.030
Titan...

25:09.187 --> 25:13.337
It's splintered
to England, 1491.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.806
She's done it.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.263
Jones.

25:19.460 --> 25:21.108
Thanks to Elliot Jones' data,

25:21.195 --> 25:23.553
we can use Titan's signature
as an anchor,

25:23.640 --> 25:26.506
and with Katarina's Tether
telemetry as a Beacon...

25:26.593 --> 25:27.678
We can lock on.

25:27.765 --> 25:29.993
And send you to 1491.

25:32.102 --> 25:34.017
You ready to get medieval?

25:40.312 --> 25:42.295
All right,
we splinter to 1491,

25:42.382 --> 25:44.202
track down
Jennifer's Primary pals.

25:44.289 --> 25:45.735
What about Jones?

25:49.394 --> 25:51.764
Best way to save her
is find the weapon first.

25:52.871 --> 25:54.938
Adler, how soon
can you program a jump?

25:55.025 --> 25:56.967
It's not me
you have to worry about.

25:57.054 --> 25:58.590
Jones' Tether

25:58.765 --> 26:01.368
should act like a kind
of lighthouse in the fog,

26:01.455 --> 26:03.434
but we are still
firing a bullet

26:03.521 --> 26:04.743
into the storm here.

26:04.830 --> 26:05.967
So aim carefully.

26:06.054 --> 26:08.962
That requires
monumental processing power.

26:09.184 --> 26:11.105
Titan has that.
We do not.

26:11.192 --> 26:12.431
Figure it out.
We're going.

26:12.518 --> 26:15.045
We could be off
by years and miles.

26:15.132 --> 26:16.829
Should you make it
through the fog at all,

26:16.916 --> 26:19.160
I am not putting
anyone in that machine

26:19.247 --> 26:21.065
until we know
what we're in for.

26:21.152 --> 26:22.571
Jesus, Julian, sack up.

26:22.658 --> 26:24.750
I will knock you
on your ass, boy!

26:24.837 --> 26:27.466
All right, all right.

26:27.624 --> 26:32.674
So basically it's good,
fast, and cheap, pick two...

26:32.761 --> 26:34.990
Only, alive,
on time, or together.

26:35.077 --> 26:36.164
Worse.

26:36.251 --> 26:37.953
If you survive,

26:38.040 --> 26:40.112
your tethers may not hold.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.766
Stranded in the Middle Ages?

26:41.853 --> 26:42.953
If you do this,

26:43.040 --> 26:45.375
there is absolutely
no guarantee that you

26:45.462 --> 26:48.411
will ever see home again.

26:51.618 --> 26:54.982
We've had missions before
we thought would be the last.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.786
This isn't any different.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.339
It is.

27:02.027 --> 27:04.005
There's an end coming.

27:04.569 --> 27:06.269
Look, I...

27:06.619 --> 27:08.677
I was and I am

27:08.832 --> 27:11.005
afraid of losing you,

27:12.461 --> 27:14.411
of losing us.

27:16.161 --> 27:18.286
But if we go,

27:18.924 --> 27:20.657
we go together.

27:23.135 --> 27:25.263
Attempting to lock on.

27:34.032 --> 27:35.940
I'd either say a prayer

27:36.386 --> 27:38.575
or read up on how to joust.

27:39.265 --> 27:41.826
Mr. Cole,
if you please.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.484
Wait, no, wait.

27:53.201 --> 27:54.577
If you're the...

27:55.818 --> 27:57.142
Whatever...

27:57.229 --> 27:59.421
The chosen one,

28:00.050 --> 28:01.400
you can't go first.

28:01.487 --> 28:02.564
It's too risky.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.927
Adler's right.
We're blind.

28:05.014 --> 28:06.531
We're in the fog.

28:07.565 --> 28:10.023
But I have always
been your Seer,

28:10.182 --> 28:11.425
- from the beginning.
- No,

28:11.512 --> 28:13.633
- No, that's my role in all of this...
- Jennifer...

28:13.830 --> 28:17.357
To make sure that you get
where you need to go.

28:18.295 --> 28:20.295
So you follow me this time.

28:34.374 --> 28:36.111
We're right behind you.

28:43.277 --> 28:45.482
Climb the steps.

28:51.573 --> 28:55.045
Initiating
splinter sequence.

29:03.903 --> 29:05.809
Come on.

29:06.895 --> 29:08.574
Adler.

29:17.499 --> 29:18.684
Adler?

29:20.022 --> 29:21.807
Adler!

29:22.385 --> 29:23.501
Did she make it?

29:23.588 --> 29:24.951
I don't know.

29:25.323 --> 29:27.115
I can't be certain.

29:27.837 --> 29:30.014
No record of arrival.

29:41.117 --> 29:42.381
Perimeter alert.

29:42.468 --> 29:43.765
Upstairs.

29:48.338 --> 29:49.921
What do we got? Scavs?

29:50.008 --> 29:51.494
Not exactly.

29:54.171 --> 29:56.400
Just when I thought
I was out,

29:56.644 --> 29:58.944
they pull me back in.

30:03.921 --> 30:06.353
You've all got that
"I forgot it's 2043" look

30:06.440 --> 30:07.522
on your face.

30:07.609 --> 30:08.994
I haven't kicked it yet.

30:09.091 --> 30:10.159
But you...

30:10.690 --> 30:11.945
The younger you...

30:12.032 --> 30:13.883
I made it to medieval times,

30:13.970 --> 30:17.197
and let me tell you,
it ain't no dinner attraction

30:17.284 --> 30:19.763
with chivalry,
revelry, and rivalry.

30:26.249 --> 30:27.766
What's happening?

30:28.173 --> 30:30.141
Green to red.

30:30.553 --> 30:32.601
Everything's changing.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.453
The circle's
not perfect anymore.

30:35.673 --> 30:36.954
Do we find the weapon?

30:37.041 --> 30:38.773
Like I always said,

30:38.958 --> 30:42.495
the right ending
is the one you choose.

30:42.582 --> 30:43.876
But you lived it.

30:43.963 --> 30:47.065
What I know, otter eyes,
and when I know it

30:47.152 --> 30:48.621
is a moving target.

30:48.882 --> 30:52.127
But you're close.
The end is in sight.

30:52.214 --> 30:55.047
But you have to go...
now.

30:55.258 --> 30:57.820
I'm in a whole lot
of trouble back there.

30:58.079 --> 31:01.088
And, Threepio, do me a favor.

31:01.175 --> 31:03.666
Fix that goddamn splinter suit.

31:03.856 --> 31:05.353
Or all of us...

31:05.462 --> 31:07.022
Dead as doornails.

31:12.501 --> 31:15.551
I've... lost her once for good.

31:15.777 --> 31:18.780
And now I've lost her forever.

31:18.867 --> 31:21.035
Hannah is fine, Jones.

31:21.122 --> 31:22.845
Wherever she is, she's okay.

31:22.932 --> 31:24.653
None of that shit was real.

31:25.403 --> 31:27.379
The fear of losing

31:27.987 --> 31:30.246
and the memory of loss

31:30.621 --> 31:33.856
is no less painful
than the moment itself.

31:34.348 --> 31:36.450
Then why didn't you
give it up sooner?

31:36.978 --> 31:40.234
I needed Olivia to feel
as if she'd earned it...

31:40.321 --> 31:42.300
A lesson she once taught me.

31:42.387 --> 31:43.715
The only difference?

31:43.802 --> 31:46.528
I learn from the past.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.291
She runs from it.

31:58.988 --> 32:00.591
Are you okay?

32:03.340 --> 32:05.160
Mr. Deacon?

32:07.290 --> 32:11.026
Weapon or no weapon,

32:11.999 --> 32:13.882
the day will come
when you're gonna have

32:13.969 --> 32:15.918
to take this place by force.

32:16.819 --> 32:18.825
And until that day is over,

32:19.480 --> 32:23.254
not me, not you,
none of us gets to give up.

32:23.662 --> 32:27.270
Go home, Mr. Deacon,
where you belong.

32:28.201 --> 32:30.498
Find the others,

32:31.476 --> 32:33.279
and end this.

32:37.445 --> 32:39.240
Hannah is lucky.

32:40.011 --> 32:42.458
Because of all
the mothers in the world,

32:43.268 --> 32:45.306
she hit pay dirt.

32:58.959 --> 33:01.343
<i>Hey, girl,
have fun with Bryan tonight.</i>

33:01.430 --> 33:03.731
<i>Call me after
with all the juicy details.</i>

33:29.234 --> 33:30.773
No, no, no.

33:30.860 --> 33:32.851
Shh, shh, shh.

33:33.362 --> 33:35.100
Where's the...

33:35.187 --> 33:36.387
Aw, man, that guy...

33:36.474 --> 33:38.208
That guy couldn't
pour a glass of water.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.350
Weak-ass pour, no style.

33:40.437 --> 33:42.387
I couldn't let you
drink that shit, no way.

33:42.474 --> 33:46.700
I mean, what's the point
in taking out a beautiful girl

33:47.042 --> 33:49.167
when I gotta
bring her back home

33:49.607 --> 33:51.372
for a decent drink?

34:02.145 --> 34:03.640
Hey, guys, uh,

34:03.727 --> 34:06.204
sorry, it's kind of
a private party situation.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.203
Door's open.
Lights are on.

34:08.290 --> 34:10.953
Look, the place doesn't gotta
look closed to be closed, okay?

34:11.040 --> 34:12.223
I got money.

34:12.310 --> 34:14.766
Why don't you just
pour us a drink, bro?

34:14.853 --> 34:17.898
Hey, please don't make me
call the cops, man, okay?

34:30.420 --> 34:31.889
Hannah!

35:27.942 --> 35:29.982
"There once was a serpent

35:30.407 --> 35:35.185
"who only traveled
in one direction.

35:35.496 --> 35:38.787
"Until one day,
the serpent

35:38.900 --> 35:40.693
came upon a demon."

36:31.158 --> 36:32.805
My dearest Hannah,

36:32.892 --> 36:35.605
I hope, by now,
you've lived a life...

36:35.692 --> 36:37.769
Or at least part of one.

36:38.048 --> 36:41.550
I hope you see now what
I've asked you to fight for...

36:41.637 --> 36:44.456
The good beneath
all its complexity.

36:44.650 --> 36:47.136
And should you
choose to continue

36:47.223 --> 36:50.081
to lay down arms
to love or to live,

36:50.168 --> 36:52.097
I shall not blame you.

36:52.337 --> 36:54.526
But if there
is fight left in you,

36:54.845 --> 36:57.901
there is one last
piece of the puzzle,

36:58.110 --> 37:00.183
and only you can find it.

37:00.587 --> 37:03.261
Her name is Marion Woods.

37:04.728 --> 37:07.597
The story came
from a woman named Marion.

37:09.548 --> 37:11.125
She was my mother.

37:13.907 --> 37:15.526
I found her...

37:17.267 --> 37:20.495
A time and a place.

37:20.876 --> 37:23.065
I know where she'll be.

37:23.579 --> 37:25.175
But know this:

37:26.689 --> 37:29.355
she could be our salvation,

37:29.470 --> 37:31.347
the key to everything,

37:31.821 --> 37:34.722
or... our undoing.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.212
My Hannah,

37:37.571 --> 37:39.500
this is the most
dangerous thing

37:39.587 --> 37:41.886
I've ever asked of you.

37:42.634 --> 37:43.954
Find her,

37:44.267 --> 37:46.081
hear her story,

37:46.689 --> 37:48.948
learn what you can,

37:50.110 --> 37:52.355
and return home.

38:16.690 --> 38:19.520
<i>My God,
that dress is incredible.</i>

38:19.721 --> 38:21.022
<i>You like it?</i>

38:21.109 --> 38:23.434
<i>Absolutely!
You look amazing.</i>

38:23.521 --> 38:24.908
<i>My name's John.</i>

38:25.191 --> 38:26.465
<i>I'm Marion.</i>

38:41.651 --> 38:42.985
"There once was a serpent

38:43.072 --> 38:45.342
who only traveled
in one direction."

38:54.848 --> 38:57.131
My mother may be a demon...

38:59.551 --> 39:01.709
But I am not.

39:02.012 --> 39:04.162
I can choose for myself...

39:04.848 --> 39:06.733
Choose my own purpose,

39:07.121 --> 39:08.387
my own life,

39:09.066 --> 39:10.297
my own name.

39:10.384 --> 39:11.909
Hi, I'm Madison.

39:11.996 --> 39:13.779
Oh, no, please,
call me Maddie.

39:13.925 --> 39:15.159
I'm Marcy Mackenzie,

39:15.246 --> 39:17.295
real nice to meet you.

39:21.469 --> 39:23.576
Hi, I'm Marion Woods.

39:26.488 --> 39:28.285
I will go back
to the world I know

39:28.372 --> 39:30.147
and find my own way.

39:30.676 --> 39:32.990
I will tell my own story.

39:38.477 --> 39:42.285
It appears she activated
one of our machines.

39:42.939 --> 39:45.425
Went back to 2009.

39:48.095 --> 39:49.689
Her work is finished.

39:50.064 --> 39:51.988
Titan is nearly complete.

39:53.056 --> 39:54.988
I will never
go back to Titan.

39:55.633 --> 39:57.452
I'm not from Titan!

39:57.539 --> 39:59.160
I only want to talk.

40:01.095 --> 40:02.986
Find Emma.

40:04.276 --> 40:05.910
End her cycle.

40:23.947 --> 40:25.269
You're hit.

40:25.471 --> 40:27.042
No, I'm okay.

40:27.619 --> 40:28.858
But the Tether...

40:28.977 --> 40:30.384
Shit!

40:31.237 --> 40:32.839
We gotta go.

40:36.677 --> 40:38.351
The end is coming.

40:38.967 --> 40:40.781
Quicker than expected.

40:45.805 --> 40:47.448
These are two of my best.

40:47.563 --> 40:50.182
Take them. Find your friends.

40:50.422 --> 40:52.815
Only this time,
bring me to them.

40:57.711 --> 41:00.174
I think
I understand you now.

41:00.508 --> 41:03.273
It's not about power
or control

41:03.360 --> 41:05.206
or reliving the past.

41:05.329 --> 41:08.112
You have no appreciation
for that.

41:09.094 --> 41:10.911
You are afraid of the end.

41:10.998 --> 41:16.085
To be in that dark...
That box... forever,

41:16.172 --> 41:19.487
that box to which
we all must someday go.

41:19.574 --> 41:22.104
A frightened little girl

41:22.243 --> 41:25.690
with no more golems
left to speak to.

41:25.938 --> 41:28.588
Even in lying,
you told me the truth.

41:29.891 --> 41:31.456
So did you.

41:31.876 --> 41:33.001
Deacon...

41:33.156 --> 41:35.667
We can't leave him behind,
not again.

41:35.813 --> 41:38.463
He was instrumental
in helping us.

41:39.088 --> 41:40.453
There's no time.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.375
- Mr. Deacon is nothing if not
- Mr. Deacon is nothing if not

41:42.462 --> 41:44.270
- monumentally resilient.
- Monumentally resilient.

41:44.357 --> 41:46.190
He can take care of himself.

41:50.106 --> 41:53.054
Thank you for confirming
what I always knew.

41:53.341 --> 41:55.827
He's far too soft
to turn on you all.

41:55.942 --> 41:57.921
I just needed a bloodhound.

41:58.263 --> 42:00.015
And when he finds them,

42:00.357 --> 42:01.777
I will kill him...

42:03.442 --> 42:05.624
And everyone you love.

42:06.981 --> 42:08.827
I will hurt them,

42:09.560 --> 42:10.991
break them,

42:11.653 --> 42:13.093
twist them round,

42:13.521 --> 42:15.499
and bleed them dry.

42:17.136 --> 42:19.632
And no weapon will stop me.

42:21.567 --> 42:23.007
And I will do this...

42:23.094 --> 42:25.452
because I have seen, Katarina.

42:26.255 --> 42:28.232
I know,

42:29.403 --> 42:33.002
because I... am the Witness.
