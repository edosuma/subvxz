38:52.675 --> 38:54.608

a wall to thinking,

38:54.642 --> 38:56.506
"I'm actually going
to write a letter saying that

38:56.541 --> 38:58.439
we don't need a wall."
- Right.

38:58.474 --> 39:00.510
Does anyone ever bother to--
I mean, are there, like,

39:00.545 --> 39:03.444
scary gunboats coming
up and down this river, uh?

39:03.479 --> 39:05.446
- I mean, I think the border
patrol technically does have

39:05.481 --> 39:07.448
a hovercraft that they've used
once and it was horrible.

39:07.483 --> 39:08.587
- Park Service does too.
- Yeah.

39:08.622 --> 39:10.624
- They have helicopters.
- For the record,

39:10.658 --> 39:13.592
I don't understand why Mexico
is made to be such an issue.

39:13.627 --> 39:16.595
I mean, it's our second biggest
trade partner aside from China.

39:16.630 --> 39:18.701
- What about the Canadians?
They're actually pouring across

39:18.735 --> 39:20.599
our borders
and stealing our jobs.

39:20.634 --> 39:23.568
- They are taking our jobs!
- Find a non-Canadian comedian.

39:23.602 --> 39:26.605
How many Canadians play hockey
in the United States

39:26.640 --> 39:28.193
for a U.S. team?

39:28.227 --> 39:30.402
- Those are high paying jobs
that Americans--

39:30.437 --> 39:31.403
- They're stealing!
They're stealing them.

39:31.438 --> 39:33.716

39:33.750 --> 39:35.683

avenues that the conversation

39:35.718 --> 39:38.755
go to where violence comes
from, where dangers come from.

39:38.790 --> 39:40.481

our small towns here.

all in one year

39:46.729 --> 39:48.420
and say it's fixed.

39:48.455 --> 39:49.559
- You know, I've been
to a few places

39:49.594 --> 39:51.630
where they do have a wall.
- Yeah.

39:51.665 --> 39:56.497
- Few things are uglier
in the entire world,

39:56.532 --> 39:58.499
of all of the places I've seen,

39:58.534 --> 40:00.570
few things have been more
of an indication

40:00.605 --> 40:05.713
of an utter failure
of otherwise smart people

40:05.748 --> 40:09.614
to figure shit out.

40:09.648 --> 40:13.238
Thank you for showing me
this amazing, amazing--

40:13.272 --> 40:16.448
I mean, just ludicrously
amazing place.
