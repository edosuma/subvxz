WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:04.838
- I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU,
JOHNNY,

00:04.872 --> 00:06.307
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GATE,

00:06.340 --> 00:08.008
THAT I'M HONORED
THAT YOU EVEN THOUGHT

00:08.042 --> 00:09.043
TO INVITE ME TO THE BARBECUE,

00:09.077 --> 00:10.844
SO THANK YOU.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.980
- EVERYONE FROM WORK'S INVITED,
BRIAN.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.582
- AND MY DAD
AND MOST OF THERESA'S FAMILY.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.184
- AND--AND I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE GONNA BE JUGGLING

00:16.217 --> 00:17.351
A LOT OF PLATES,

00:17.385 --> 00:18.752
AND I DON'T WANT TO ADD ONE MORE

00:18.786 --> 00:19.987
SCINTILLA OF STRESS
TO THE SITUATION.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.189
- SCINTILLA?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.756
WHAT ARE YOU--
SPIT IT OUT.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.757
- CAN I BRING GABBY?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.259
- OF COURSE YOU CAN.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.594
THE MORE, THE MERRIER.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.028
I'M BUSTING OUT MY NEW GRILL

00:28.062 --> 00:29.930
THAT MY DAD GOT US
AS A HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.665
- IT ARRIVED?
- YESTERDAY. IT'S HUGE.

00:31.699 --> 00:32.766
IT'S LIKE THE BIGGEST GRILL
I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.235
- [laughs]
LOOK AT YOU.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.769
LIT UP LIKE A KID ON CHRISTMAS.

00:35.803 --> 00:36.737
- [laughs]
HONESTLY, I CAN'T STOP SMILING.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.372
MY CHEEKS HURT.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.440
THAT'S HOW HAPPY I AM
ABOUT THIS GRILL.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.041
[laughs]

00:41.075 --> 00:42.910
- CHICAGO NORTH,

00:45.446 --> 00:46.880
- CUBS AND SOX.
[siren wails]

00:46.914 --> 00:48.549
AMBULANCE 14 RESPONDING.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.584
YOU KNOW WHO WON?
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.120
IT'S GONNA BE A GROUP
OF HAPPY DRUNK ASSHOLES

00:52.153 --> 00:53.921
PISSING OFF A GROUP
OF UNHAPPY DRUNK ASSHOLES.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.257
- CUBS 4 TO 3.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.192
- OH, THERE WE GO.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.227

BIG RED BOX.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.272
- OH, MAN.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.406
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE
A LOT OF FUN.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.407
- YEAH, ISN'T IT?

01:13.441 --> 01:14.942
[crowd cheering]

01:14.975 --> 01:16.910
- HOW BAD THEY GET THIS TIME,
ANDY?

01:16.944 --> 01:19.046
- AH, PRETTY LIGHT.
BOTH TEAMS SUCKED THIS SEASON.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.382
SO MIGHT BE
FIVE OR SIX BUSTED-UP HANDS,

01:21.415 --> 01:23.417
THREE CONCUSSIONS,
A BROKEN NOSE OR TWO.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.752
WE ONLY GOT A FEW AMBOS,

01:24.785 --> 01:25.786
SO YOU MIGHT BE HAULING
A FULL BOAT.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.455
- OKAY.
- SCREW THE CUBS.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.422
- WHITE SOX STINK.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.757
[air hisses]

01:29.790 --> 01:32.426
- GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.262
- IT'S NICE TO SEE TRADITIONS

01:34.295 --> 01:36.130
BEING HANDED DOWN
TO THE NEXT GENERATION.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.632
- YEAH, I LOVE THIS TOWN.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.301
- [laughs]

01:40.334 --> 01:43.271
[hip-hop music]

01:43.304 --> 01:51.212
*

02:03.557 --> 02:05.293
- DO YOU HAVE TO BE DRUNK
TO ENTER THE STADIUM?

02:05.326 --> 02:07.695
- CUBS ARE A GODDAMN
EMBARRASSMENT TO THIS CITY.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.029
- OKAY, FELLAS,
LET'S KEEP IT BREEZY.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.664
- WE'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT?

02:10.698 --> 02:12.500
ARE YOU SO CONCUSSED
THAT YOU CAN'T REMEMBER

02:12.533 --> 02:15.936
THAT YOUR TEAM INTENTIONALLY
THREW A WORLD SERIES FOR MONEY?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.271
- COME ON, GUYS,
GIVE IT A REST.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.607
- LAST TIME YOU WON,
106 YEARS AGO.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.209
THINK ABOUT THAT.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.311
THE LAST TIME THE CUBS
WON THE WORLD SERIES,

02:23.344 --> 02:25.779
OUR ARMY STILL RODE HORSES
INTO BATTLE.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.047
- ENOUGH.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.816
THOUGH, SADLY, IT'S TRUE.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.051
- ALSO, WRIGLEY'S
A VERY EFFEMINATE BALLPARK.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.653
- OKAY, NOW I KNOW
HIS BRAIN IS BRUISED,

02:32.686 --> 02:34.622
BECAUSE WRIGLEY
IS AN AMERICAN CLASSIC.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.324
- ALL THAT GIRLY IVY
ON THE WALLS?

02:36.357 --> 02:38.226
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HANG
SOME PLANTS IN THE DUGOUT,

02:38.259 --> 02:39.993
PAINT THE INFIELD DIRT FUCHSIA,

02:40.027 --> 02:41.462
AND COMPLETE THE WHOLE
CHICK APARTMENT EXPERIENCE?

02:41.495 --> 02:42.696
- HEY, I'M GONNA
PULL THIS RIG OVER

02:42.730 --> 02:43.997
IF YOU TWO DON'T SHUT UP.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.199
- HE STARTED IT.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.200
- HE REALLY DID, JOHN.
- HEY.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.202
[both grunt]
- SH--.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.670
- EVEN THEIR FANS CAN'T HIT
WHAT THEY'RE SWINGING AT.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.171
- YEAH, FUNNY, FUNNY.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.406
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT CELLULAR PARK?

02:52.440 --> 02:54.308
NOTHING.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.076
- AT LEAST WE DON'T HAND OUT
TISSUES ON THE WAY OUT.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.011
- I REALLY DON'T GET
WHY PEOPLE NEED TO FIGHT.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.880
WE'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME TEAM,

02:59.913 --> 03:01.181
THE CITY OF CHICAGO,

03:01.215 --> 03:03.016
WHICH IS PART OF A LARGER TEAM

03:03.050 --> 03:04.985
KNOWN AS THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA,

03:05.018 --> 03:07.187
WHICH IS JUST ONE PART
OF TEAM EARTH,

03:07.221 --> 03:08.989
AND BEYOND THAT,

03:09.022 --> 03:10.691
YOU HAVE THE INTERGALACTIC
FEDERATION OF PLANETS,

03:10.724 --> 03:12.360
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S CURRENTLY
NO PROOF THAT IT EXISTS.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.728
- THERE IS IF YOU READ
THE RIGHT PUBLICATIONS.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.664
WE'LL SIDEBAR ABOUT THIS LATER.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.533
- IT'S IN OUR NATURE TO FIND
DIFFERENCES IN EACH OTHER.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.201
IT'S HOW WE DEFINE OURSELVES.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.103
THERE'S NO US WITHOUT A THEM,

03:23.136 --> 03:25.205
BLACK, WHITE;
NORTH SIDE, SOUTH SIDE;

03:25.239 --> 03:26.840
RICH, POOR;
FAT, SKINNY.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.076
PERSONALLY, I FIND
THE WHOLE THING EXHAUSTING.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.511
AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE,

03:30.544 --> 03:32.546
I'VE DIVIDED THE WORLD
INTO TWO GROUPS:

03:32.580 --> 03:35.549
PEOPLE WHO FISH
AND FISH.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.950
- [chuckles]

03:36.984 --> 03:38.952
BRIAN, PEOPLE WILL FIGHT
ABOUT ANYTHING.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.688
- THE ONLY WAY
PEOPLE EVER COME TOGETHER

03:40.721 --> 03:43.223
IS WHEN THEY FIND
A COMMON ENEMY.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.025
- I USED TO WORK IN THIS
WAREHOUSE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.462
EVERYONE IN SHIPPING
HATED EVERYONE IN RECEIVING,

03:48.496 --> 03:50.798
AND THE ONLY THING
THEY COULD ALL AGREE ON

03:50.831 --> 03:51.932
WAS EVERYONE IN SALES
WAS AN ASSHOLE.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.401
- WELL, THEY ARE,

03:53.434 --> 03:55.068
BECAUSE THEY THINK
THAT WHATEVER THEY WANT,

03:55.102 --> 03:56.937
IT CAN JUST MAGICALLY APPEAR
WHENEVER THEY WANT IT,

03:56.970 --> 03:59.607
EVEN IF IT'S BEEN BACKORDERED
FOR THREE DOGGONE MONTHS.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.541
- DID YOU WORK IN SHIPPING,
BRIAN?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.310
- AUTO PARTS.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.944
A LOT OF OUR STUFF HAD TO COME
ALL THE WAY FROM JAPAN.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.579
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
A CLASSIC "US VERSUS THEM" THING

04:05.613 --> 04:07.147
IN ACTION AT MY BARBECUE
THIS WEEKEND.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.382
MY DAD'S GONNA BE THERE
AND THERESA'S DAD,

04:08.416 --> 04:10.117
A FIREMAN AND A COP.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.785
IT'S GONNA BE A CONSTANT FIGHT
ALL DAY LONG.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.254
- THAT SH-- IS ANCIENT,
TRIBAL,

04:14.288 --> 04:15.923
WHICH MAKES NO GODDAMN SENSE,

04:15.956 --> 04:18.392
SINCE 80% OF BOTH OF THOSE CREWS
ARE IRISH.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.328
- AND AS WE ALL KNOW,
THE IRISH HAVE NEVER FOUND

04:20.361 --> 04:21.895
A SINGLE THING
TO FIGHT EACH OTHER OVER.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.131
- ARE THERE ANY SUBJECTS
WE SHOULD STAY CLEAR OF?

04:24.164 --> 04:25.232
- ALL OF THEM.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.634
- MEN SITTING AROUND A FIRE,

04:26.667 --> 04:28.669
STOKING BIG EMBERS OF HATRED,

04:28.702 --> 04:31.905
THEIR DARKEST NATURES
ON FULL DISPLAY.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.106
- I GET IT
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO COME.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.141
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

04:34.174 --> 04:36.477
I'M GONNA BE THERE EARLY.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.479
- GRACIAS, PAPI.

04:38.512 --> 04:41.248
YO, T, YOUR DAD IS SUPER EXCITED
ABOUT THE BARBECUE.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.650
IT'S, LIKE,
ALL HE CAN THINK ABOUT.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.352
- REALLY?
- MM.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.353
- YOU TALKED TO MY DAD?

04:45.386 --> 04:46.454
- NO, HE TEXTED ME.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.755
- YOU TEXT WITH MY DAD?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.256
- YOU DON'T?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.157
- NO, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE COULD TEXT.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.925
- YEAH, I TAUGHT HIM.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.594
IT WASN'T EASY, THOUGH.
HE'S GOT BIG FINGERS.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.128
- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET MY DAD
TO TEXT FOR YEARS.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.364
- OH, YEAH, TAUGHT HIM
AT THE BOWLING ALLEY.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.931
- YOU BOWL WITH HIM TOO?
- YEAH.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.433
HE'S THE CAPTAIN OF OUR TEAM.
- [laughs]

04:59.467 --> 05:00.768
- AND I WAS LIKE,
"JERR, YOU AIN'T GETTING

05:00.801 --> 05:02.436
"NO FROZEN YOGURT AFTERWARDS

05:02.470 --> 05:05.806
UNTIL YOU SEND ME
FIVE PERFECT TEXTS, NO TYPOS."

05:05.839 --> 05:07.941
HE DID IT, T.
I WAS SO PROUD OF HIM.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.644
WE GOT THREE FLAVORS
OF FROYO THAT NIGHT.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.882
HONESTLY, ONE OF THE BEST PARTS
ABOUT DATING MAEVE

05:14.915 --> 05:16.316
IS GETTING TO KNOW YOUR FATHER.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.885
I THINK HE MIGHT BE LIKE
MY BEST FRIEND.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.153
I HAVEN'T HAD A BEST FRIEND
IN A LONG TIME.

05:20.187 --> 05:23.657
[engine turns over]

05:23.691 --> 05:24.725
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.159
HE DOESN'T LIKE ANYONE.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.696
IN FACT,
HE PRETTY MUCH HATES EVERYONE.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.064
- OH, T, HATE IS A STRONG WORD.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.333
JERR DON'T HATE ANYBODY.
HE'S A TEDDY BEAR.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.335
IN FACT, I CALL HIM JERR-BEAR.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.504
HE LOVES IT.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.471
HE CALLS ME BILLY-GOAT.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.406
[cell phone dings]

05:38.439 --> 05:39.473
HMM.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.341
OOH, GUESS WHO.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.677
- JERR-BEAR?
- NAH, IT'S MY COUSIN BEBO.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.879
HE WANTS TO HANG OUT LATER,
PLAY SOME XBOX.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.887
[background chatter]

06:01.061 --> 06:02.362
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- HEY.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.998
THIS GRILL IS AMAZING.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.534
I THINK I'M GONNA COOK
ALL OF OUR MEALS ON THIS THING,

06:06.567 --> 06:08.101
BREAKFAST, LUNCH, AND DINNER.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.737
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE BREAKFAST
ON THERE.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.004
- I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS THING CAN DO ANYTHING.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.406
IT MIGHT HAVE
SATELLITE CAPABILITIES.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.674
I HAVEN'T READ
THE ENTIRE MANUAL YET.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.409
- WELL, IF IT'S GONNA MAKE
OUR DADS

06:15.443 --> 06:16.744
DROP THEIR STUPID BEEF
WITH EACH OTHER,

06:16.777 --> 06:18.579
I WILL DEFINITELY BE IMPRESSED.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.414
- THIS THING'S GREAT AT BEEF.
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.549
THEY HAVE TO DROP THEIR SH--;
IT'S EXHAUSTING.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.616
- THEY'RE NOT YOUNG MEN.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.617
I DON'T SEE THEM CHANGING.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.018
- HEY, KIDS.
- HEY.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.720
- HEY, FRANK.
- SOME MACHINE, HUH?

06:26.754 --> 06:28.922
OH, MY GOD, IT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN THE CATALOG.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.024
EVERYTHING SMELLS DELICIOUS.
- YEAH.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.192
- HERE, LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.226
- OKAY, AH.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.628
JUST A COUPLE RULES, DAD.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.897
I'M RUNNING THE SHOW HERE.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.466
THIS ENTIRE AREA IS MINE.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.567
- UNDERSTOOD,
I GOT IT.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.034
- OKAY.
- [clears throat]

06:41.068 --> 06:42.570
- WHAT?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.271
OH, AND I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO PUT IN

06:44.304 --> 06:45.573
A LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT
WITH THERESA'S DAD TODAY.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.140
- OH, HE'S COMING?
THAT PIECE OF--

06:47.174 --> 06:48.576
- DAD.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.243
- OH, SORRY, THERESA.
NO OFFENSE.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.378
- NO, HERE'S THE DEAL, OKAY?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.713
YOU GUYS HAVE TO PUT AN END

06:52.746 --> 06:54.748
TO THIS COP-FIREMAN BULLSH--
TODAY

06:54.782 --> 06:55.949
AND BE CIVILIZED HUMAN BEINGS.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.585
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

06:57.618 --> 07:00.754
- YOU JUST KEEP ME FED,
I'LL BE A GOOD BOY.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.155
- ALL RIGHT, HERE'S MY DAD.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.557
I'M TELLING HIM THE SAME THING.
- OKAY.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.592
- JOHN.
- OKAY.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.661
- GOD, DID HE GET SHORTER?

07:07.695 --> 07:09.730
COPS OFTEN SHRINK UNDER
THE WEIGHT OF THEIR OWN GUILT.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.998
IT'S A PROVEN FACT.
- COME ON, MAN.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.633
- I'M NOT GONNA START ANYTHING.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.967
I'M JUST HERE
FOR A COUPLE BEERS,

07:14.001 --> 07:16.003
COUPLE BURGERS,
COUPLE LAUGHS.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.805
LOOK AT HIM BACKING
HIS WAY OVER HERE.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.507
- WHAT?

07:19.540 --> 07:20.641
- HE CAN'T WAIT
TO POKE HIS NOSE IN THIS GRILL

07:20.674 --> 07:21.975
AND START YAPPING.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.777
COPS,
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.579
NOSY BASTARDS.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.248
LOOK AT HIM, TRYING
TO SNEAK HIS WAY OVER HERE.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.450
- LOOK, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO BE THE BIGGER PERSON TODAY.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.752
- THAT WON'T BE HARD.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.453
[laughs]

07:33.487 --> 07:34.922
THAT'S ONE OF THE LAUGHS
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.189
- REAL FUNNY.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.457
- I THOUGHT I SMELLED GAS.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.526
- HEY.
- HERE WE GO.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.460
- SERIOUSLY?
A GAS GRILL?

07:40.494 --> 07:43.030
- HELLO, MY GOOD MAN.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.499
- WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

07:45.533 --> 07:46.867
- SH--.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.772
- MAC, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.641
- SPECIAL KIND OF HURRICANE.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.510
I GOT THE RECIPE WHEN I WAS
TENDING BAR IN NEW ORLEANS.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.478
LOCALS USED TO
DUMP IT ON GRAVES,

07:58.512 --> 08:00.480
KEEP THE EVIL AWAY.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.650
- HOW COME YOU DIDN'T BRING
HOT DOUG--I MEAN DOUG?

08:02.683 --> 08:03.817
- WE BROKE UP.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.218
TURNS OUT IT'S REALLY HARD

08:05.252 --> 08:06.453
TO MAINTAIN THE INTENSITY
THAT YOU GET

08:06.486 --> 08:08.288
WITH INTERNET COMMUNICATION.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.190
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.225
IT'S A WHOLE NEW THING.
- ACTUALLY, I WOULD.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.128
I WAS SNOOPING AROUND ONE TIME
ON A WEBSITE

08:15.162 --> 08:18.131
DEDICATED TO SMALLMOUTH BASS
AND OTHER LAKE FISH.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.301
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M IN A HEATED EMAIL EXCHANGE

08:21.334 --> 08:22.903
WITH A WOMAN NAMED SHELLEY.

08:22.936 --> 08:26.339
STARTED OFF DEBATING
OVER LIVE BAIT AND LURES

08:26.373 --> 08:29.409
AND ENDED UP WITH
AN INTENSE DECLARATION OF LOVE.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.844
- TURNS OUT SHELLEY WAS A DUDE,
HUH?

08:30.878 --> 08:31.979
- YEP.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.314
GOT CATFISHED ON A FISHING SITE.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.382
- [laughs]

08:35.415 --> 08:37.551
- I AIN'T JUDGING NOBODY.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.654
- OH, BRIAN AND GABBY ARE HERE.

08:40.688 --> 08:41.655
- OH, GOOD.

08:41.689 --> 08:42.690
GOOD.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.891
THAT GABBY.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.593
WHAT A SMILE, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.328
- SURE LIGHTS UP A ROOM
OR A BACKYARD.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.530
LIGHTS UP A WHOLE BACKYARD.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.533
[upbeat music]

08:53.567 --> 08:55.335
*

08:55.368 --> 08:57.537
- HONEY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO START
WITH A SMALLER CUP.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.240
- I'M FINE, YOU GUYS.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.474
UH-HUH.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.377
- DAMN.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.180
- SOMEBODY'S DANCING
WITH THE HURRICANE.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.348
- HEY, VOO.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.349
- WHERE'S DOUG?

09:09.382 --> 09:10.350
- WE BROKE UP.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.719
HEY, GABBY.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.220
THAT'S A CUTE TOP.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.421
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN YOU

09:14.454 --> 09:15.555
OUT OF YOUR NURSE'S UNIFORM.

09:15.589 --> 09:16.590
YOU LOOK GOOD.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.263
THESE ARE AWESOME.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.198
YOU SHOULD GO GET SOME.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.267
MAYBE SHARE ONE.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.874
- HANK,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.275
- WITH WHAT?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.044
- I NEED YOU
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.545
- OKAY.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.881
- DO YOU THINK MY SON CARTER
IS A GAY?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.215
- HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT,
BRIDGET?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.651
- JUST LISTEN.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.385
HE'S IN THE HIGH SCHOOL
THEATER PROGRAM.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.088
HE DOESN'T LIKE SPORTS.
HE HAS A HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.422
I THINK HE'S GAY,

09:49.456 --> 09:51.291
BUT I WANTED
A PROFESSIONAL OPINION.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.427
- I'M NOT GETTING
A GAY VIBE FROM HIM.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.929
I DON'T THINK HE IS.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.065
- STATISTICALLY SPEAKING,
HE SHOULD BE.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.668
THEY SAY THAT ONE
OUT OF EVERY TEN PEOPLE IS GAY.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.169
NOW, MY OTHER NINE KIDS
ARE STRAIGHT,

10:02.202 --> 10:03.804
SO THAT LEAVES JUST CARTER.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.505
- THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
HOW IT WORKS,

10:05.538 --> 10:08.108
AND HAVING
STEREOTYPICALLY GAY INTERESTS

10:08.141 --> 10:09.076
DOESN'T MAKE HIM GAY.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.310
- CAN YOU BE A DEAR

10:10.343 --> 10:11.945
AND INVESTIGATE FOR ME?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.313
- YOU KNOW, YOU COULD JUST
ASK HIM YOURSELF,

10:13.346 --> 10:15.082
CONSIDERING
HE IS YOUR SON AND ALL.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.685
- I'VE TOLD CARTER
IT'S OKAY IF HE'S GAY.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.119
THE NEW PRIEST AT OUR CHURCH

10:19.152 --> 10:20.487
IS ACCEPTING
OF ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLES.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.189
- UH-HUH.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.957
- MY FRIEND MAURA'S SON
CAME OUT OF THE CLOSET

10:23.991 --> 10:26.326
AND GOT A STANDING OVATION
AT THE 10:30 MASS,

10:26.359 --> 10:28.328
AND THAT IS THE MASS.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.797
OH, IF ONLY
HE COULD COME OUT THEN.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.331
BUT LISTEN TO ME GO ON AND ON.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.632
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.201
IT COULD BE ANY MASS.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.369
CHRISTMAS EVE WOULD BE
A CROWD-PLEASER.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.038
COULD YOU JUST TALK TO HIM?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.140
- OKAY, I'LL LOOK INTO IT
FOR YOU.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.641
- THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.676
YEAH.

10:42.710 --> 10:43.977
DAMN SHAME.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.647
- HOW CAN YOU FIND
ONE POSSIBLE FLAW

10:47.681 --> 10:49.182
WITH THIS MAGNIFICENT MACHINE?

10:49.216 --> 10:50.483
- ITS EXISTENCE IS ITS FLAW.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.651
IT'S A GAS GRILL.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.886
IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.487
- WHAT IS WRONG
WITH A GAS GRILL?

10:54.521 --> 10:55.989
- YOU GET NO CHAR.
THE CHAR IS WHERE THE FLAVOR IS.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.958
YOU NEED TO FLIP THAT ONE.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.293
- DON'T FLIP THAT BURGER.
YOU'LL LET THE JUICES OUT.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.029
- HE LET THE JUICES OUT
WHEN HE BOUGHT A GAS GRILL.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.697
- THIS GRILL IS TOP OF THE LINE.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.498
TELL HIM HOW MUCH IT COST,
JOHNNY.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.234
- BOTH OF YOU LET IT DROP.
- LOOK, WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.169
I MEAN, A GRILL IS A GRILL,
AS LONG AS IT USES CHARCOAL.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.071
- THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS
THING I EVER HEARD.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.006
THIS BABY HAS
FOUR DIFFERENT COOKING ZONES

11:13.040 --> 11:15.709
INCLUDING ROTISSERIE
AND A SEARING BURNER.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.410
THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE GRILL.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.378
- I KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.813
I SAW IT IN THE CATALOG

11:19.847 --> 11:21.581
NEXT TO THE SELF-ROTATING
WINE RACK

11:21.614 --> 11:24.151
IN THE EXPENSIVE,
USELESS SH-- SECTION.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.685
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST BOUGHT
A CHEAPER GRILL

11:25.719 --> 11:26.686
AND COOKED THE MONEY.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.055
- BOTH OF YOU SHUT IT

11:28.088 --> 11:30.724
AND TRY A BURGER.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.927
I GUARANTEE YOU YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MISS ANY CHAR IN THIS BAD BOY.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.429
- MMM, THIS BURGER
IS PERFECTION, SON.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.565
JERRY, TELL ME
THAT'S NOT A JUICY BURGER.

11:38.598 --> 11:42.035
- HEY, JERR, I GOT THE BURGERS
YOU ASKED FOR, BROTHER.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.771
- BILLY CEPEDA TO THE RESCUE!

11:43.804 --> 11:45.873
- ALWAYS.
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

11:45.906 --> 11:47.174
- HEY.
- WHAT'S UP, Y'ALL?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.508
- HEY.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.010
- WHERE SHOULD I PUT
MY PASTELON?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.011
- YOUR WHAT?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.079
- MY PASTELON.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.546
I LEARNED TO MAKE IT

11:53.580 --> 11:54.748
WHEN I WENT TO PUERTO RICO
WITH BILLY.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.049
- YEAH, IT'S DELICIOUS.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.017
THIS THING'S GOT BEEF.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.351
IT'S GOT CHEESE.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.386
IT'S GOT PLANTAINS.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.287
- OH, I HAD THAT ONCE.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.454
IT'S GOOD.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.890
BANANA LASAGNA.
- [chuckles]

12:02.923 --> 12:04.892
- THE THING
ABOUT PUERTO RICAN CUISINE

12:04.925 --> 12:05.893
WHICH I LOVE IS THAT
IT'S HEARTY, HEALTHY,

12:05.926 --> 12:07.560
AND IT TASTES GOOD.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.529
IT'S NOT EMPTY CALORIES,
LIKE AMERICAN FOOD.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.730
- DID YOU MAKE THAT YOURSELF,
SWEETHEART?

12:10.764 --> 12:12.532
- I BASICALLY DID.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.902
I WAS IN THE KITCHEN
WITH BILLY'S MOM AND EBOLA.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.804
- OH, THERE'S EBOLA IN THAT.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.039
- EBOLA IS SPANISH
FOR "GRANDMOTHER," THERESA.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.107
GOD.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.275
LEARN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.611
I MEAN, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW ABOUT
OTHER PEOPLE'S CULTURES TOO.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.279
- IT'S ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED
ABUELA, BABE.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.581
- EBOLA IS A DISEASE, MAEVE.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.918
- EXCUSE ME, THERESA.
I'VE BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.721
I'M SORRY I'M NOT UP TO DATE
ON THE NEW AMERICAN DISEASES.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.589
- CAN YOU JUST PUT IT
ON THE TABLE, PLEASE?

12:36.623 --> 12:38.058
- CAN I HAVE A SERVING SPOON,
THERESA?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.759
- YOU KNOW
WHERE THE SPOONS ARE, MAEVE.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.761
- I DO, BUT I'M A GUEST.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.729
- [inhales deeply]

12:42.762 --> 12:43.797
FINE.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.498
- AMERICANS.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.633
- HEY, Y'ALL GOT TO TRY
SOME OF THIS PASTELON.

12:46.666 --> 12:47.968
IT'S AMAZING.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.937
- WE WILL, BILLY.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.672
- I TEXTED BILLY AS SOON
AS I SMELLED THE POISONOUS GASES

12:52.705 --> 12:54.741
EMANATING FROM
THIS OVERPRICED MONSTROSITY.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.476
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME
WITH THIS SH--?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.445
- [laughs]

12:58.478 --> 12:59.446
MMM.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.515
SO GOOD.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.484
YOU SMELL THAT CHAR?
- I DON'T NEED CHAR.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.019
SEE THE JUICES
COMING OUT OF THIS?

13:06.053 --> 13:07.354
- YOU TEXTED BILLY?

13:07.387 --> 13:08.288
- YEAH, HE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO TEXT.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.322
OH, THE KID IS DYNAMITE.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.657
WE HANG OUT ALL THE TIME.

13:10.690 --> 13:11.791
- ONLY BEEN ASKING YOU
TO HANG OUT

13:11.825 --> 13:13.626
FOR THREE YEARS OR SO.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.794
- WHAT WOULD WE TALK ABOUT?

13:14.828 --> 13:15.762
WE GOT NOTHING IN COMMON.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.130
- YEAH, KID.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.631
YOU NEVER PLANTED DRUGS
ON A SUSPECT.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.868
- YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS REGRET
NOT HAVING A JOB

13:20.901 --> 13:22.502
WHERE I GOT TO SLEEP IN A ROOM

13:22.535 --> 13:24.337
WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER MEN
FOUR NIGHTS A WEEK.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.039
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:26.073 --> 13:27.174
I'M NOT GETTING SUCKED
INTO THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.009
I ALMOST DID,
BUT I'M NOT.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.679
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME
WITH MY GRILL, MAKING BURGERS.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.219
- HEY, KEEP EYES ON VOO.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.720
- VOODOO CAN HANDLE HERSELF.

13:40.753 --> 13:41.821
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.523
- YOU DON'T KNOW MY PUNCH.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.993
ROLLING STONES CAME INTO MY BAR
AFTER A SHOW ONE NIGHT,

13:46.026 --> 13:48.161
AND HALFWAY THROUGH
HIS THIRD ROUND OF THAT STUFF,

13:48.195 --> 13:51.464
KEITH RICHARDS PISSED HIMSELF
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BAR.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.400
KEITH RICHARDS.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.568
- I DOUBT IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.337
- MAYBE I SHOULD GO TALK TO HER.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.671
THINK THAT'D BE OKAY?

13:58.705 --> 14:00.173
- YEAH, I THINK IT'D BE NICE.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.674
- SHE USUALLY LISTENS TO ME.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.742
- YOUNG PEOPLE, STOP.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.644
STOP.
LISTEN TO ME.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.813
WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO WORK THROUGH THEIR SH--,

14:06.846 --> 14:08.715
LET 'EM WORK THROUGH THEIR SH--.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.018
THEN CALL 'EM A CAB
IF THEY NEED ONE.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.719
VOODOO, KEYS.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.557
GRAB THOSE FOR ME, KEVIN.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.427
THANKS.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.539
- MMM.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.275
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.243
NO WAY YOU MADE IT.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.078
- OF COURSE NOT.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.112
DON'T TELL THERESA.

14:39.146 --> 14:42.849
- OKAY, YOU OWE ME.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.952
- HEY,
SORRY ABOUT MY MOM.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.719
YEAH, I SAW HER TALKING
YOUR EAR OFF BEFORE,

14:46.753 --> 14:48.121
AND I'M PRETTY SURE I CAN GUESS
WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.923
- YOU CAN, CAN YOU?

14:49.957 --> 14:52.125
- YEAH, SHE TELLS EVERYBODY
SHE THINKS I'M GAY.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.793
- [sighs]

14:53.826 --> 14:56.296
LOOK, IT'S A HARD THING
FOR A LOT OF PARENTS

14:56.329 --> 14:57.864
TO WRAP THEIR MIND AROUND.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.866
- YEAH, NO, I KNOW.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.800
UH...

15:03.270 --> 15:04.771
CAN I TELL YOU A SECRET?

15:04.804 --> 15:05.738
- SURE.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.243
- I'M NOT GAY.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.579
- OKAY.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.880
WHY IS THAT A SECRET?

15:13.913 --> 15:16.083
- BECAUSE MY MOM
THINKING I'M GAY

15:16.116 --> 15:18.885
IS THE BEST THING
THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.388
OKAY, I'M THE ONLY
HIGH SCHOOL KID I KNOW

15:21.421 --> 15:23.623
WHO'S ALLOWED TO HAVE
SLEEPOVERS WITH GIRLS.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.426
I BANGED THIS ONE CHICK
IN HER OWN BED LAST NIGHT,

15:26.459 --> 15:28.328
AND HER PARENTS WERE HOME.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.963
IT'S OFF THE HOOK.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.798
THEY--THEY BROUGHT US BREAKFAST
IN THE MORNING.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.000
- FOR REAL?
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.101
NO PUN.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.102
SEE, AT FIRST, I WAS PISSED

15:35.135 --> 15:36.669
MY PARENTS THOUGHT I WAS GAY

15:36.703 --> 15:38.771
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE SPORTS
AND GRILLING

15:38.805 --> 15:40.107
AND ALL THAT MANLY CRAP.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.608
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO LIKE, THOUGH?

15:41.641 --> 15:42.942
PUSSY.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.478
- HOLY SH--, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.913
YOU'RE LIKE
A STEPHEN HAWKING BRAIN

15:46.946 --> 15:48.415
WITH A WORKING DICK GENIUS.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.849
- APPRECIATE THAT.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.018
- I'M PROUD OF YOU, MAN.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.352
GENIUS.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.320
MAN.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.130
- SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO CALL YOU

16:03.163 --> 16:04.097
ONE OF THOSE "YOU-BERS"?

16:04.131 --> 16:06.033
- WHAT THE HELL?

16:06.066 --> 16:09.269
STATS, LOOK AT THESE BRANCHES
JUST HANGING OVER INTO THE YARD.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.438
YOUR TREE HAS CROSSED THE LINE!

16:11.471 --> 16:12.605
- IT'S OKAY.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.940
- WHY ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS?

16:13.973 --> 16:16.709
YOU'RE LIKE MRS. RULES--
MS. RULES.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.977
- WHAT?
NO, I'M NOT.

16:18.011 --> 16:18.978
- YEAH.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.847
YEAH, YOU ARE.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.484
DON'T WORRY, I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT, MISS RULES.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.852
THESE BRANCHES ARE UNACCEPTABLE.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.556
- WHOA, WAIT,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:29.589 --> 16:33.193
- WHERE YOU FEAR TO TREAD,
MR. RULES.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.128
- THAT'S NOT MY NAME.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.064
- OH, MAN.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.531
THAT'S A TASTY BURGER, BRO.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.667
- THANK YOU, BILLY.
- MM-HMM.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.236
- IT'S JUICY BECAUSE IT'S NOT
DRIED OUT FROM THE CHARCOAL.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.404
- DAD.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.005
- YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF IRONIC

16:46.039 --> 16:46.973
THAT A FIREMAN'S AFRAID TO COOK
WITH REAL FIRE.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.408
- DAD.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.476
- IT'S DIFFERENT
FROM BEING A COP.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.378
YOU CAN'T TASER AN UNARMED FIRE.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.413
- THEY ALWAYS LIKE THIS?
- YEAH, THEY HATE EACH OTHER.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.481
- NAH, JERR-BEAR
DON'T HATE NO ONE.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.083
- JERR-BEAR?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.584
- HE'S THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED
TO CALL ME THAT.

16:57.617 --> 16:58.585
- OH.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.652
- HEY!

16:59.686 --> 17:01.354
THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.589
- WHAT THE HELL?

17:02.622 --> 17:03.690
- VOO.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.724
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?

17:04.757 --> 17:05.692
- THERE'S NOBODY HOME.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.760
I LET MYSELF IN.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.997
THEY GOT SOME REALLY NICE STUFF
IN HERE.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.899
[loud crash]

17:14.767 --> 17:17.504
DOES ANYBODY HAVE GLUE?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.572
A LOT OF GLUE.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.607
- UM...

17:20.640 --> 17:21.674
I'M GONNA GO GET HER.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.177
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.846
- GABBY, IF YOU AND BRIAN
EVER BREAK UP

17:26.879 --> 17:28.715
AND HE STARTS
CHUGGING HURRICANES,

17:28.748 --> 17:31.184
LET HIM WORK OUT HIS OWN SH--.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.552
- OH!

17:32.585 --> 17:33.420
WHO MESSED WITH THE HEAT
ON THIS BURNER?

17:33.453 --> 17:34.854
- IT WAS TOO LOW.

17:34.887 --> 17:35.788
IT'S A GRILL,
NOT A TANNING BED.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.257
- THE HEAT WAS PERFECT.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.092
- IT WAS TOO LOW.
IT NEEDS MORE HEAT.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.527
WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME CHAR.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.728
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S THE LAST TIME

17:41.761 --> 17:42.762
YOU SAY "CHAR" TODAY.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.063
- ALL RIGHT, THESE ARE THE WORDS

17:44.097 --> 17:45.465
THAT ARE BANNED
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.466
- CHAR.
- CHARCOAL.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.634
- FIRE.
- FIREFIGHTER.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.568
- COPS, GAS, AND JUICY.
GOT IT?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.137
- GOT IT.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.438
HOW ABOUT YOU, JERR-BEAR?
- I TOLD YOU.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.605
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.407
KITCHEN'S CLOSED.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.409
THERESA, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN ME FOR A HURRICANE?

17:56.443 --> 17:58.245
- I WOULD LOVE THAT.
- A STRONG HURRICANE.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.446
- ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

17:59.479 --> 18:01.148
- CHAR.
- YOU WANT SOME CHAR?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.882
WHY DON'T YOU PUT
YOUR FAT ASS ON HERE,

18:02.915 --> 18:04.251
AND I'LL CHAR IT UP FOR YOU!

18:08.788 --> 18:10.757
- VOO.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.226
VOODOO.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.461
HEY, VOO.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.595
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- NOTHING.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.963
JUST LOOKING FOR A BIG-ASS KNIFE

18:16.996 --> 18:19.098
TO CUT DOWN THAT TREE.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.133
- UM...

18:20.167 --> 18:21.234
I THINK YOU MAY HAVE HAD

18:21.268 --> 18:22.269
TOO MUCH PUNCH.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.236
YOU HAVE A PUNCH MUSTACHE.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.904
- I KNOW THAT.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.606
- DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW
ABOUT MY PUNCHSTACHE?

18:26.639 --> 18:27.640
I LOVE MY PUNCHSTACHE.

18:27.674 --> 18:28.641
PEOPLE COMPLIMENT ME ON IT.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.177
EVERYONE BUT YOU.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.611
- LET'S JUST GO BACK
TO THE PARTY, HUH?

18:31.644 --> 18:32.679
- YOU THINK THAT'D BE BEST?

18:32.712 --> 18:33.746
- I DO.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.515
- WELL, TOO BAD.

18:35.548 --> 18:40.520
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CONTROL
HURRICANE VOODOO.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.022
ALL YOU CAN DO IS RIDE THE WIND.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.792
HURRICANE FORCE WIND,
CATEGORY AWESOME.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.494
- VOO, STOP IT.
STOP.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.595
STOP IT.
DON'T.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.330
- HEY, WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?

18:50.363 --> 18:52.532
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
WITH GABBIGALE?

18:52.565 --> 18:53.800
- I'M HERE
BECAUSE YOU SEEM UPSET,

18:53.833 --> 18:55.835
AND I CARE ABOUT YOU.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.541
- I KNOW.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.142
I KNOW YOU DO, BRIAN.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.512
IT'S JUST--IT'S HARD.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.381
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

19:08.415 --> 19:09.882
BUT WE'RE GONNA BE GOOD.

19:09.916 --> 19:10.883
- YEAH?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.118
- YEAH.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.486
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.289
- EVENTUALLY.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.158
BUT FOR NOW...

19:19.192 --> 19:20.627
THERE'S NOBODY HOME,

19:20.660 --> 19:23.296
SO IT'S
"JUMP ON THE BED WITH ME" TIME.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.297
- NO.
- YEAH.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.832
- VOODOO, COME ON.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.334
WE ARE TRESPASSING RIGHT NOW.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.535
- HERE, WATCH THIS.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.902
KARATE.
[grunts]

19:29.936 --> 19:32.138
[thud]

19:32.171 --> 19:34.040
- VOODOO, YOU OKAY?

19:34.073 --> 19:35.675
- DID THAT LOOK COOL?

19:40.613 --> 19:43.082
- SO WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT CARTER?

19:43.115 --> 19:44.751
- I THINK
HE'S JUST FIGURING STUFF OUT.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.753
- AHA.
THAT'S CODE FOR GAY.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.087
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,

19:48.120 --> 19:49.055
BUT I DO KNOW YOUR SON
IS A GENIUS.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.557
- CARTER?
NO.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.824
I LOVE THAT BOY,

19:51.858 --> 19:53.226
BUT, BELIEVE ME,
HE'S NO GENIUS.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.861
I DON'T THINK
HE EVER BROUGHT HOME

19:54.894 --> 19:57.096
ANYTHING BETTER
THAN A B-MINUS ON A REPORT CARD.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.566
- TELL HIM NO MORE SLEEPOVERS
UNTIL HE GETS STRAIGHT As,

19:59.599 --> 20:02.335
I GUARANTEE YOU
THOSE GRADES WILL SKYROCKET.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.870
HE'S A GENIUS.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.938
- [laughs]
I DIDN'T THINK I WAS DRUNK,

20:05.972 --> 20:07.940
BUT NOW THAT I'M UPSIDE DOWN,
WHOO!

20:07.974 --> 20:10.377
HEY.
HEY, WHAT'S UP WITH THE GRILL?

20:10.410 --> 20:13.212
- OOH, JOHNNY, JOHNNY, GRILL.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.517
[indistinct chatter]

20:17.550 --> 20:19.185
- FINE.
- IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.687
- OH.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.721
- IT'S--
I GOT IT.

20:21.754 --> 20:22.622
- IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.690
- FUEGO!

20:23.723 --> 20:24.724
- NO, DON'T.

20:24.757 --> 20:29.262
[overlapping shouting]

20:29.296 --> 20:31.097
- CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
- CALL AN AMBULANCE.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.633
- NOTICE NO ONE SAID,
"CALL THE COPS."

20:41.741 --> 20:42.775
- [groans]

20:42.809 --> 20:44.043
- YOU CALL THAT A BURN?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.878
THAT'S FIRST DEGREE,
AT BEST.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.147
CHECK THIS OUT.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.384
THAT'S SECOND DEGREE,
BORDERLINE THIRD.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.486
- MAYBE SECOND DEGREE,
BUT IT'S TINY.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.722
I'VE SEEN BIGGER SUNBURNS.
- MINE'S GOING DOWN MY HAND.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.624
I'M IN SKIN GRAFT
TERRITORY HERE.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.959
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S SOME
NICE CHAR YOU GOT THERE, JOHN.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.127
SEE, THAT'S THE COLOR
YOU WANT YOUR CHICKEN.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.062
- NAH, YOU FRY A CHICKEN.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.131
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
TO A PERFECTLY INNOCENT BIRD?

21:05.164 --> 21:07.434
BEER CAN UP ITS ASS OVER WOOD.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.801
- HEY, DOC.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.236
HOW MUCH LONGER
WE LOOKING AT HERE?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.938
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.
ASK A NURSE.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.340
- BALLPARK.
- NURSE.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.407
- OH.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.475
both: DOCTORS.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.109
- SO ARROGANT.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.511
- THEY THINK
THEY'RE FRIGGIN' GODS.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.079
- HALF THE TIME,
THEY'RE JUST GUESSING.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.514
- "HALF THE TIME,"
THAT'S BEING GENEROUS.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.482
- THE TOUGHEST PART
OF A DOCTOR'S DAY

21:22.515 --> 21:23.416
IS CHANGING HIS TEE TIME.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.784
- YEAH.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.285
- DECIDING BETWEEN STEAK
AND LOBSTER.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.454
- THEY JUST ORDER BOTH.
- THEY DO.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.488
- PIGS.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.489
both: BASTARDS.
