<i>OPUS PICTURES PRESENTS</i>

00:45.125 --> 00:47.423
<i>A BK PICTURES PRODUCTION</i>

00:48.028 --> 00:50.496
<i>EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS
LEE TAE HUN, KIM WOO TAEK</i>

00:54.067 --> 00:56.035
<i>PRODUCED BY SHIM BO-KYOUNG</i>

00:56.570 --> 00:58.561
<i>DIRECTED BY CHOI HO</i>

01:09.983 --> 01:15.521
Iko CHOI has been proving himself
worthy of his nickname, the 'Zombie.'

01:15.522 --> 01:18.324
He delivers an average of
100 strikes per round

01:18.325 --> 01:20.350
to his opponent's perfect submission

01:20.494 --> 01:25.364
while displaying an incredible ability
to take the most brutal blows.

01:25.365 --> 01:27.299
A true warrior at heart.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.102
Formerly a rising soccer star,

01:30.103 --> 01:33.639
CHOI was the youngest player
to debut in the K League.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.876
But after single-handedly
knocking down

01:36.877 --> 01:39.678
11 players of his opposing team
on the field,

01:39.679 --> 01:41.814
he was permanently barred
from the football association.

01:41.815 --> 01:45.851
The incident gave him the nickname,
a 'Forward who never returns.'

01:45.852 --> 01:51.023
His bad boy behavior on the field
may have given him a red card

01:51.024 --> 01:55.327
but it has landed him a shot
in the WFC title match

01:55.328 --> 01:57.853
as the first-ever Korean fighter.

01:57.931 --> 02:00.666
There's never been another
genius like him.

02:00.667 --> 02:04.470
The impossible endurance
and endless optimism...

02:04.471 --> 02:07.940
And there it is,
the infamous 'Zombie Dance'!

02:07.941 --> 02:12.207
We would love to see
that dance once again.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.514
<i>What's your secret weapon
against the champion?</i>

02:15.515 --> 02:17.278
<i>My weapon?</i>

02:17.384 --> 02:19.682
<i>It's my brother.</i>

02:20.320 --> 02:23.689
<i>In this historic event, CHOI
will be going up against</i>

02:23.690 --> 02:27.159
<i>the notorious Andrei Anatoivich.</i>

02:27.160 --> 02:29.253
<i>Get yourself ready
for the big match.</i>

02:33.066 --> 02:37.025
<i>BIG MATCH</i>

02:38.471 --> 02:41.304
<i>Unfortunate news has
just come in.</i>

02:41.708 --> 02:49.708
<i>The defending champion, Anatoivich,
was tested positive for illegal drugs.</i>

02:49.983 --> 02:53.646
<i>A truly devastating outcome for CHOI</i>

02:53.720 --> 02:58.924
<i>who went through 8 months of
gruel training with his brother</i>

02:58.925 --> 03:01.360
<i>in preparation of this match.</i>

03:01.361 --> 03:04.888
<i>Anatoivich has a history of
substance abuse...</i>

03:17.410 --> 03:19.503
Poor bastard...

03:19.946 --> 03:24.076
8 months of hard work
goes out the window.

03:25.252 --> 03:27.119
Should I cancel the fan meeting?

03:27.120 --> 03:28.610
No, that's fine.

03:29.289 --> 03:31.519
I know just what to do
in a situation like this.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.185
I'll deal with Iko.

03:34.995 --> 03:37.496
So, the meeting goes as planned?

03:37.497 --> 03:38.497
Sure.

03:38.832 --> 03:39.832
Alright!

03:40.100 --> 03:42.295
Counting on you, coach.

03:50.977 --> 03:52.205
Yo, Iko!

03:52.312 --> 03:53.973
What are you doing
huddled up in there?

03:54.748 --> 03:55.748
You crying?

03:55.849 --> 03:57.976
Will a round of jujitsu
cheer you up?

04:00.720 --> 04:01.720
What the?

04:02.188 --> 04:03.655
Come and have some.

04:03.757 --> 04:05.816
You crazy?

04:05.959 --> 04:08.985
It's a lost opportunity
not the end of the world.

04:09.963 --> 04:11.089
You ate all this?

04:11.197 --> 04:12.664
We'll start over.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.634
With the match canceled,

04:15.635 --> 04:18.160
you don't know who might
throw down the gauntlet.

04:18.605 --> 04:21.874
You can't be pigging out
like this.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.977
I might lose my mind
if I don't do this.

04:24.978 --> 04:27.879
Come on, a crisis is a chance
and a chance is an opportunity.

04:29.349 --> 04:30.839
Put down your chopsticks now.

04:36.957 --> 04:39.551
Drop the drumstick.

04:45.465 --> 04:48.332
Stop chewing. Stop it, damn it.

04:53.273 --> 04:54.900
Aw, my shoulder!

04:56.209 --> 04:57.904
You'll pay for that.

04:57.978 --> 04:59.138
Hey!

04:59.646 --> 05:01.136
For crying out loud.

05:08.254 --> 05:11.348
<i>We're live from
Iko's fan meeting.</i>

05:11.458 --> 05:14.860
<i>To be honest, I wasn't impressed
after watching his debut match.</i>

05:14.861 --> 05:17.196
<i>I thought his days
were numbered.</i>

05:17.197 --> 05:20.666
<i>I pride myself as being
the best MMA analyst.</i>

05:20.667 --> 05:24.125
Iko gave my prediction a knockdown.

05:24.237 --> 05:27.400
Yes, we call men like
that 'Champions'.

05:32.245 --> 05:36.875
We lost our parents early.

05:36.950 --> 05:39.544
So, I had to be Iko's parent.

05:39.652 --> 05:41.950
From an early age,

05:42.522 --> 05:45.753
his body always reacted
faster than the brain.

05:49.662 --> 05:51.296
And I see that his nephew
is no ordinary boy either.

05:51.297 --> 05:53.959
He won't give up his food.

05:54.768 --> 05:57.965
It runs in the family.

05:58.038 --> 06:01.098
Never giving up, the power...

06:04.244 --> 06:08.271
My husband and Iko are like
two bodies and one soul.

06:08.415 --> 06:11.873
He can tell how Iko feels from
the sound of him urinating.

06:12.652 --> 06:14.051
Anyway,

06:15.455 --> 06:19.892
I had just left
the national wrestling team

06:19.893 --> 06:23.192
because of my recurrent
shoulder dislocation problem.

06:23.696 --> 06:26.231
So, I started coaching Iko.

06:26.232 --> 06:28.792
Then, I discovered

06:29.135 --> 06:30.898
that he was a natural.

06:31.237 --> 06:32.761
At striking?

06:32.872 --> 06:33.998
No, at taking blows.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.835
He has no fear of getting
beat up.

06:36.943 --> 06:39.104
Striking is an acquired skill

06:39.579 --> 06:42.810
but taking blows is
in the spirit.

06:43.550 --> 06:47.886
I swore to myself that
I'll make my brother a champion

06:47.887 --> 06:50.321
that you see on 9 o'clock news.

06:50.657 --> 06:51.749
Champion!

06:51.958 --> 06:53.084
Champion!

06:53.193 --> 06:54.455
Champion!

06:54.594 --> 06:55.720
Champion!

06:55.862 --> 06:56.988
Champion!

06:57.163 --> 06:58.391
Champion!

07:07.807 --> 07:12.267
How's our straight shooter
Iko doing?

07:12.445 --> 07:13.537
What brings you here?

07:13.680 --> 07:16.877
To discuss our contract,
of course.

07:17.350 --> 07:21.150
Let's pick up where we left off.

07:22.188 --> 07:23.246
Shall we?

07:24.691 --> 07:25.691
What the heck?

07:25.825 --> 07:28.127
<i>"For roadwork"</i>
Who knows?

07:28.128 --> 07:30.392
Maybe he'll fetch a big sponsor this time.

07:30.497 --> 07:32.931
Think business for a change.

07:34.734 --> 07:36.167
Do you mind?

07:39.472 --> 07:42.703
Do you know how many athletes
got their careers cut short

07:42.909 --> 07:45.036
because of his fraudulent contract?

07:46.346 --> 07:49.315
Just leave my job to me.

07:50.783 --> 07:54.153
How do you explain that guy
who never wins a game

07:54.154 --> 07:56.884
but still makes tons of money
on endorsements and TV shows?

08:00.193 --> 08:01.626
These days,

08:01.928 --> 08:06.160
I'm worried we're getting
way more luck than we deserve.

08:06.466 --> 08:09.601
What if Iko lets his success
get the better of him?

08:09.602 --> 08:11.900
What if he gets injured?

08:12.005 --> 08:14.599
I'm treading carefully
like walking on thin ice.

08:16.409 --> 08:17.876
Tomorrow morning 6:00 a.m.

08:17.877 --> 08:19.242
Road work!

08:20.947 --> 08:22.437
Where are you going at this hour?

08:22.549 --> 08:24.710
To do business that
you love so much.

08:24.984 --> 08:26.679
He's got no brain for money.

08:32.558 --> 08:33.426
Where to?

08:33.427 --> 08:36.087
This address, please.

09:54.207 --> 09:55.207
Iko!

09:56.309 --> 09:57.674
- Go, champion!
- What's up?

11:03.943 --> 11:05.535
Are you here?

11:13.353 --> 11:15.753
We're from Nambu Police Station.

11:16.556 --> 11:18.657
We'd like to ask you a few
questions in relation to a case.

11:18.658 --> 11:21.752
You have a brother called
'Yeong-ho'?

11:21.961 --> 11:24.122
Do you know where he is?

11:24.864 --> 11:27.697
Excuse me.
Let me take that call.

11:33.206 --> 11:34.400
Hello?

11:34.507 --> 11:35.208
<i>Where are you?</i>

11:35.209 --> 11:37.005
<i>Did you take off with
your brother again?</i>

11:37.610 --> 11:43.548
He didn't come home last night,
and doesn't answer my calls.

11:43.549 --> 11:44.783
<i>Now the police?
I'm so gonna kill him.</i>

11:44.784 --> 11:46.952
- Well...
- It's like raising three boys.

11:46.953 --> 11:48.750
<i>- I'm so sick of it!</i>
- Hello?

11:55.795 --> 11:57.763
<i>"Yeong-ho"</i>

12:08.307 --> 12:10.741
We found this
at the crime scene.

12:10.977 --> 12:12.103
Mr. Iko,

12:13.012 --> 12:15.913
do you know Sugar Park, the promoter?

12:17.517 --> 12:19.417
There's been a murder.

12:22.722 --> 12:23.722
What?

12:35.268 --> 12:36.565
Player in the house.

12:39.439 --> 12:42.499
This man was killed 12 hours ago.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.210
And this is the account

12:45.211 --> 12:47.679
that the victim opened
in your brother's name.

12:47.980 --> 12:51.149
I know you brothers train really hard

12:51.150 --> 12:53.516
but realistically,

12:53.653 --> 12:57.180
you can't make this kind of
money solely from MMA.

12:57.256 --> 12:59.190
Isn't that right?

13:00.760 --> 13:02.728
I think we understand what happened.

13:02.829 --> 13:04.228
Let's not make this complicated.

13:05.198 --> 13:06.426
Where's your brother?

13:07.800 --> 13:08.800
Where is he?

13:13.439 --> 13:17.967
My brother would never get himself
involved in something like this.

13:18.644 --> 13:20.245
Can I go if you're done?

13:20.246 --> 13:21.907
Where would you go?

13:22.081 --> 13:23.673
To find my brother.

13:25.651 --> 13:29.018
I'm sorry but you're a suspect, too.

13:29.121 --> 13:32.784
Because you're a flight risk,
you can't go anywhere.

13:32.925 --> 13:33.983
Stick around for a while.

13:37.763 --> 13:39.788
He's like a goddamn bucking bull!

13:42.468 --> 13:46.234
Older brother is a retired
wrestler on national team.

13:46.472 --> 13:49.373
Younger brother is an MMA fighter.

13:50.843 --> 13:53.678
People like them shouldn't be
allowed to walk around freely.

13:53.679 --> 13:55.113
They're walking weapons.

13:55.114 --> 13:57.849
They should be made
to wear ankle monitors.

13:57.850 --> 14:00.785
I'm actually a big fan of his.

14:00.887 --> 14:03.288
That explosive energy is
his trade mark.

14:03.289 --> 14:04.756
Good for you.

14:04.891 --> 14:06.449
Explosive energy, my ass.

14:06.559 --> 14:11.258
Track down the brother before
the reporters sniff out a scoop...

14:14.200 --> 14:16.191
what the hell is he doing?

14:37.523 --> 14:41.084
What a psycho!

14:41.727 --> 14:43.718
What's going on?

14:57.843 --> 14:59.310
Go away.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.406
Open it.

15:03.716 --> 15:05.411
What the heck?

15:05.518 --> 15:06.610
Your brother.

15:07.820 --> 15:09.014
Yeong-ho.

15:16.862 --> 15:17.862
Yeong-ho?

15:34.513 --> 15:35.639
What's this?

15:48.160 --> 15:50.287
<i>Iko?</i>

15:50.496 --> 15:51.496
Yeong-ho!

15:54.667 --> 15:57.402
Can you hear me? Hello?

15:57.403 --> 15:58.631
Yes... yeah!

15:58.804 --> 16:03.366
Where the hell are you?
What's all this about?

16:03.542 --> 16:05.877
The police've got
all the wrong ideas.

16:05.878 --> 16:07.758
- Hey, listen!
<i>- They're accusing you of murder.</i>

16:07.847 --> 16:09.337
I'm at the police station.

16:09.582 --> 16:10.615
Hello?

16:10.616 --> 16:12.743
Shut up and
listen to me carefully.

16:12.985 --> 16:14.452
Call the police now!

16:16.355 --> 16:17.355
Yeong-ho!

16:19.859 --> 16:20.859
<i>Hello?</i>

16:21.060 --> 16:22.894
Hello to you,

16:22.895 --> 16:26.262
<i>the hero of
the Korean MMA scene.</i>

16:28.567 --> 16:31.365
I'm the one that's holding
your brother captive.

16:31.504 --> 16:32.994
We have an issue to resolve.

16:33.105 --> 16:37.201
Who are you?
Why are you doing this to us?

16:38.511 --> 16:42.747
I'm telling you that your
brother's life depends on you.

16:42.748 --> 16:43.449
What?

16:43.450 --> 16:45.183
You're going to do exactly
as I tell you from now.

16:45.184 --> 16:48.745
<i>If you disobey my orders,
your brother will be killed</i>

16:49.055 --> 16:50.818
like the poor bastard
from last night.

16:50.923 --> 16:54.225
<i>Same will happen
if you call the police.</i>

16:54.226 --> 16:56.854
You can kiss your brother
good bye forever.

17:00.466 --> 17:02.024
Do you need a proof to believe me?

17:04.637 --> 17:06.471
I am watching your every move,

17:06.472 --> 17:10.101
how you're leaning against
the wall and shaking your foot.

17:23.923 --> 17:26.892
Am I being punk'd?

17:29.862 --> 17:32.797
<i>Are you from Super Action TV?</i>

17:37.203 --> 17:40.434
- Does have a mental illness?
- There's nothing in the record.

17:41.774 --> 17:43.935
<i>Iko... Iko...</i>

17:44.877 --> 17:47.779
<i>Do as they say for now.</i>

17:47.780 --> 17:49.581
- What?
<i>- Just do what they say!</i>

17:49.582 --> 17:50.674
<i>Oh God...</i>

17:54.920 --> 17:57.286
Luxury cannot be not traded.

17:57.556 --> 18:02.493
The moment you walk into Chanel
or Hermes and buy something,

18:02.828 --> 18:05.626
it becomes just a product.

18:06.031 --> 18:10.934
And repeated experience of that
makes you believe you own the world.

18:11.437 --> 18:14.167
Reserved only for seven players,

18:15.074 --> 18:21.138
an exclusive gambling experience
dedicated to chosen seven that rules Korea.

18:21.614 --> 18:24.716
<i>99th Horse: Iko CHOI</i>
Everything that happens is real
with only the minimum intervention.

18:24.717 --> 18:26.437
<i>99th Horse: Iko CHOI</i>
And today's horse is...

18:29.355 --> 18:32.791
Can you hear me?

18:34.193 --> 18:37.028
<i>Every second you waste
with questions</i>

18:37.029 --> 18:39.998
will be taken off
your brother's clock.

18:40.399 --> 18:43.101
I will kill you
when I catch you.

18:43.102 --> 18:44.763
<i>I'll teach you pain.</i>

18:44.870 --> 18:46.770
And don't you lay a finger
on my brother.

18:46.872 --> 18:49.741
Not a finger, you hear me?

18:49.742 --> 18:52.074
Put on the bracelet

18:52.178 --> 18:55.011
<i>if you want to find your brother.</i>

19:04.957 --> 19:06.686
Now get moving.

19:06.792 --> 19:07.693
What?

19:07.694 --> 19:10.218
Find the Red Angel outside.

19:10.296 --> 19:11.388
Red what?

19:12.131 --> 19:14.031
Let's go.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.167
<i>Get moving.</i>

19:16.168 --> 19:17.328
Your time has started.

19:17.903 --> 19:20.167
Put my brother back on.

19:21.540 --> 19:22.564
Ding!

20:18.597 --> 20:20.827
Hey!

20:20.966 --> 20:22.058
What the heck?

20:23.035 --> 20:24.593
How did you get out?

20:26.171 --> 20:28.264
Is this really not...

20:28.607 --> 20:30.438
a hidden camera prank?

20:30.709 --> 20:32.233
Get him!

20:34.980 --> 20:36.504
I'll only be a few hours.

20:40.753 --> 20:42.120
My brother is being held captive.

20:42.121 --> 20:44.749
Wait.
If you'll just listen to me...

20:45.357 --> 20:47.052
I need to go out for a second.

21:14.119 --> 21:18.656
Location, police station.
15 homicide detectives present.

21:18.657 --> 21:20.892
Will your horse in handcuffs
make it past the detectives?

21:20.893 --> 21:24.028
Will his escape effort
succeed or fail?

21:24.029 --> 21:25.553
Place your bets now.

21:25.631 --> 21:27.598
<i>Okay, let's get the ball rolling.</i>

<i>See that door to your left?</i>

21:38.110 --> 21:40.101
Get him!

21:59.932 --> 22:01.661
Back off! Stand back!

22:08.407 --> 22:09.772
Give me a break!

22:17.082 --> 22:18.344
What the?

22:20.285 --> 22:21.650
Oh man...

22:44.076 --> 22:46.135
I got him!

22:49.782 --> 22:51.249
You alright?

22:51.583 --> 22:54.017
You see? I told you to back off.

23:17.076 --> 23:21.445

23:59.551 --> 24:00.219
What?

24:00.220 --> 24:02.120
<i>I tell you where to go
at every step.</i>

24:02.121 --> 24:02.888
You bastard!

24:02.889 --> 24:04.651
<i>Alright, alright.
Now go straight.</i>

24:06.425 --> 24:07.983
<i>Stop.</i>

24:09.695 --> 24:12.289
<i>You should look around carefully.</i>

24:14.199 --> 24:15.530
<i>That's not it.</i>

24:16.135 --> 24:17.468
Where, then?

24:17.469 --> 24:19.061
<i>Door 2, on your left.</i>

24:23.175 --> 24:24.175
<i>Turn right.</i>

24:28.847 --> 24:30.838
Now go straight!

24:45.797 --> 24:47.230
Oops!

24:58.010 --> 25:01.207
I think you can clear the fence
at 11 o'clock.

25:09.087 --> 25:10.349
Who is that joker?

25:10.656 --> 25:12.817
Hey, you in cuffs.

25:13.692 --> 25:14.556
Alpha.

Penetrate the wall of men!

25:58.604 --> 25:59.628

26:25.163 --> 26:26.163
Back up!

26:42.714 --> 26:44.875
Barricade!

26:54.059 --> 26:55.651
Don't let him get away!

26:55.794 --> 26:57.895
The betting pool has reached
3 million dollars.

26:57.896 --> 26:58.730
No more bets, please.

26:58.731 --> 27:00.823
<i>What's the hurry, man?</i>

27:04.336 --> 27:06.327
The dealer rolls the dice.

27:09.508 --> 27:12.705
Bravo, don't back out!

27:31.063 --> 27:32.655
Move over!

27:33.532 --> 27:35.397
The bastard's mine!

27:50.649 --> 27:51.649
Where is he?

27:51.683 --> 27:52.584
Where's the bastard?

27:52.585 --> 27:55.720
Did you catch him?
He's in there?

27:55.721 --> 27:56.721
We got him.

27:56.822 --> 27:58.255
We got him, sir.

27:58.924 --> 27:59.924
Who the hell is he?

28:00.025 --> 28:02.186
He is highly dangerous.

28:02.260 --> 28:03.955
You sure you got him?

28:07.065 --> 28:08.430
Oh my...

30:09.688 --> 30:11.781
If the horse gets in the car,
'success' wins.

30:16.461 --> 30:17.291
The Red...

30:17.429 --> 30:18.919
Hey, Red!

30:23.335 --> 30:25.030
Red!

30:25.837 --> 30:26.837
Stop!

30:29.207 --> 30:30.731
What the heck?

30:30.842 --> 30:31.842
Hey!

30:32.010 --> 30:33.443
You, Red!

30:44.289 --> 30:45.289
The goddamn Red...

30:46.758 --> 30:47.986
Red?

30:48.627 --> 30:49.889
Are you the Red Angel?

30:51.696 --> 30:53.357
Why would I get in?

30:53.565 --> 30:55.362
Where's the son of a bitch
that called me?

30:56.268 --> 30:58.065
Do you have some water?

30:59.838 --> 31:01.430
Water. I need water.

31:13.385 --> 31:15.352
<i>The fugitive may be

31:18.790 --> 31:20.348
So, you won't talk.

31:20.659 --> 31:23.685
Do you think I'll go soft
because you're a girl?

31:24.496 --> 31:26.259
My brother would never...

31:26.364 --> 31:29.128
Damn smoke... He'd never
be involved in a shady business.

31:36.241 --> 31:38.300
You'll just play dumb?

31:39.144 --> 31:41.669
Is that how you wanna play this?

31:50.622 --> 31:52.180
Alright, fine.

32:00.999 --> 32:02.125
Who are you?

32:02.434 --> 32:03.526
A gangster?

32:04.703 --> 32:06.034
How old are you?

32:06.471 --> 32:07.471
Who the hell are you?

32:07.472 --> 32:09.206
The one that shows your way.

32:09.207 --> 32:10.299
Ha!

32:10.942 --> 32:13.911
Your boss is a hidden camera
and you're a human navigator?

32:14.212 --> 32:15.270
That works.

32:15.981 --> 32:18.381
This is all I know.

32:18.783 --> 32:22.776
So, there's no point
in hassling me, okay?

32:29.361 --> 32:30.953
Damn it.

32:32.530 --> 32:38.059
<i>Iko CHOI who escaped from
police custody is still missing.</i>

32:38.236 --> 32:39.260

Is it true that Iko killed a man?

32:42.273 --> 32:43.467
I don't know!

32:43.541 --> 32:49.741
<i>The search effort is met with difficulty

32:52.150 --> 32:54.482

Let's get you prettied up
for your brother.

33:04.429 --> 33:06.897
Just relax.

33:17.308 --> 33:20.141
Is this where my brother is?
And the peeping Tom?

33:20.245 --> 33:22.713
I only know where
I have to take you.

33:23.815 --> 33:26.682
You won't get in
looking like that.

34:06.424 --> 34:07.424
Harder!

34:22.574 --> 34:24.775
Listen to the instructions
from your bracelet.

34:24.775 --> 34:27.010
It'll control your movement
from now.

34:27.011 --> 34:29.980
Only my brother controls
what I do, okay?

34:32.150 --> 34:33.844
Shut up and follow me.

34:38.223 --> 34:40.554
<i>Tic toc, time is running out.</i>

34:41.092 --> 34:44.527
<i>Your interest is piling up.</i>

<i>I should get your brother
to make up the loss.</i>

34:47.065 --> 34:49.032
<i>Should I go for the finger
or the eye?</i>

34:49.033 --> 34:50.226
Hey! Hey!

34:50.335 --> 34:52.335
I'm here as you wanted.
Where do you want me to go?

34:52.337 --> 34:54.605
<i>Don't let the Red Angel

34:54.606 --> 34:57.700
Can you get rid of
that annoying stalker?

34:57.842 --> 35:00.834
The boss is expecting me
and he won't get off my back.

35:06.217 --> 35:07.284
What do you want?

35:07.285 --> 35:09.052
I need to go with that girl.

35:09.053 --> 35:11.283
Get the hell out of here.

35:20.865 --> 35:21.957
Not bad.

35:23.535 --> 35:24.855
Make sure he doesn't get through.

35:25.570 --> 35:26.696
Your brother came for you.

Sing us a song.

35:56.501 --> 35:57.501

Time is ticking away.

36:03.608 --> 36:06.475
Sing me a song and
I'll give you a hint.

36:07.512 --> 36:09.412
Take it or leave it.
You want me to hang up?

44:42.393 --> 44:43.393
Yes, sir.

44:52.103 --> 44:53.502
Where's my brother?

44:54.205 --> 44:55.263
Your brother?

45:08.719 --> 45:10.710
Where did you take him?

45:13.691 --> 45:15.792
My brother, Yeong-ho!

45:15.793 --> 45:17.727
Who the hell is that?

45:17.828 --> 45:19.996
Yeong-ho CHOI.
Don't you know who that is?

45:19.997 --> 45:22.365
Who sent you?

45:22.366 --> 45:24.634
- Tell me.
- Who... sent you?

45:24.635 --> 45:26.796
<i>Iko... I'm alright.</i>

45:29.039 --> 45:30.199
<i>I'm fine.</i>

45:44.355 --> 45:46.983
<i>Did you do your road work?</i>

45:47.224 --> 45:49.818
<i>Kim Hye-soo, Gianna Jeon
and Ko So-young!</i>

45:53.464 --> 45:56.627
<i>Iko, do your 10 KM!</i>

45:58.536 --> 46:00.936
<i>Unleash your fierceness!</i>

46:01.138 --> 46:02.833
<i>He tried to hurt himself.</i>

46:03.274 --> 46:05.469
So, I could only send you
one finger.

46:05.943 --> 46:08.878
You want to meet the rest
of your brother?

46:09.647 --> 46:12.081
<i>Get out of the building
and find the Red Angel.</i>

46:12.383 --> 46:14.647
Oops, a police squad
in the building!

46:16.821 --> 46:18.254
<i>Need another tip?</i>

46:21.759 --> 46:25.559
You'll find your exit route
on the roof top.

46:49.153 --> 46:50.245
What happened in here?

46:50.354 --> 46:51.255
A war broke out?

46:51.256 --> 46:53.416
Are they all dead?

46:53.524 --> 46:56.526
- Get everyone arrested.
- Yes, sir!

46:56.527 --> 46:58.688
Don't bother with handcuffs.
They're barely alive.

46:58.963 --> 47:00.260
The commission in the pot?

47:00.364 --> 47:01.524
6 million dollars.

47:01.732 --> 47:03.723
<i>Can't believe
I just lost 7 million.</i>

47:16.046 --> 47:19.379
- Search other rooms.
- We're on it.

47:50.447 --> 47:51.846
He wants me to jump?

47:58.355 --> 47:59.822
Freeze, you bastard!

48:03.093 --> 48:05.186
Hands up.

48:06.163 --> 48:07.357
Now!

48:08.365 --> 48:13.894
Budge an inch and I'll put
a bullet through your brain.

48:14.038 --> 48:15.038
Is that clear?

48:15.673 --> 48:17.834
With all due respect,
I need to catch someone now.

48:18.242 --> 48:20.977
He has my brother.
And I'm chasing that bastard.

48:20.978 --> 48:22.579
Alright, I got you.

48:22.580 --> 48:23.947
You're not going anywhere.

48:23.948 --> 48:26.115
I'm gonna catch that bastard.
And you catch me, okay?

48:26.116 --> 48:28.551
What the hell?

48:28.552 --> 48:31.788
The three of us will meet
and clear any misunderstanding.

48:31.789 --> 48:33.122
My gun.

48:33.123 --> 48:35.325
You should never let me go, okay?

48:35.326 --> 48:38.659
- What are you doing?
- Never give up on me.

48:39.496 --> 48:41.064
What are you trying to do?

48:41.065 --> 48:42.327
No, you can't.

48:42.499 --> 48:43.659
Are you out of your mind?

49:00.718 --> 49:01.946
Put the horse to sleep.

49:02.886 --> 49:03.886
Get moving.

49:16.800 --> 49:17.800
He's not here.

49:19.703 --> 49:21.432
<i>Guru, track him down!</i>

49:21.572 --> 49:23.335
<i>But he's right there.</i>

49:33.450 --> 49:36.385
This punk won't give me
the time of the day.

49:37.021 --> 49:38.545
Give me a break.

49:39.423 --> 49:42.790
Okay.
He's near Cheongdam Bridge.

49:46.497 --> 49:47.964
Not again.

49:48.165 --> 49:49.723
He's going off the grid again.

49:51.035 --> 49:52.832
What was his last position?

49:53.604 --> 49:54.604
Here.

49:59.443 --> 50:00.842
Previous route?

50:13.090 --> 50:13.957
<i>Kimhae Seafood</i>

50:13.957 --> 50:14.957
Kim Hye-soo...

50:16.660 --> 50:18.924
It's Kim Hye-soo, 5 KM.

50:19.329 --> 50:21.695
It's a breeze so far, right?

50:22.733 --> 50:25.065
Kim Hye-soo... the beautiful Hye-soo.

50:25.169 --> 50:27.569
Jeonja world, Gianna Jeon. 7 KM.

50:27.905 --> 50:29.065
Come on, man.

50:30.541 --> 50:31.541
Gianna!

50:43.821 --> 50:45.812
I found him!
Jamwon Hangang Park!

51:09.646 --> 51:10.646
It's you again.

51:12.149 --> 51:12.716
Aw!

51:12.717 --> 51:15.048
Get in the car, will ya?

51:15.452 --> 51:18.888
- Stop giving me trouble.
- So, you're an athlete.

51:22.025 --> 51:23.117
I'm gonna kill you all.

51:33.937 --> 51:35.768
Get off of me!

51:36.039 --> 51:39.202
Now is time to use your brain.

51:39.309 --> 51:42.676
Do your brother
a favor and think!

51:42.780 --> 51:44.372
Check that out!

51:49.953 --> 51:50.953
Where are you going?

51:51.054 --> 51:52.112
Damn you!

51:52.356 --> 51:54.221
I'll deal with you later.

51:56.393 --> 51:58.657
He's heading toward Hannam Bridge.

52:02.666 --> 52:03.666
Jo!

52:17.481 --> 52:18.514
Ko So-young.

52:18.515 --> 52:18.916
<i>"Koso Bean (Flavorsome beans)"</i>

52:18.917 --> 52:20.406
10 KM.

52:24.354 --> 52:27.687
<i>"Unleash your fierceness"</i>
<i>Unleash your fierceness!</i>
<i>Get to the top!</i>

52:32.496 --> 52:36.091
Look at you panic.
It can only mean one thing.

52:36.667 --> 52:38.999
Iko's made it!

52:39.136 --> 52:42.003
My brother's here, isn't he?

52:42.105 --> 52:43.197
He'll kick your asses!

52:49.346 --> 52:50.938
You're all going down.

53:50.274 --> 53:51.434
Horse in captivity.

53:51.541 --> 53:52.633
Situation resolved.

54:07.057 --> 54:08.388
Come on. Let's move.

54:08.825 --> 54:10.918
That's evidence.

54:11.028 --> 54:13.596
Sir, I got something.

54:13.597 --> 54:14.597
What?

54:16.366 --> 54:18.334
When was this taken?

54:18.502 --> 54:21.335
This came through the hot line.

54:21.638 --> 54:25.574
Darting in and out of places...
what the heck are they doing?

54:25.676 --> 54:27.507
I showed it to the men we arrested.

54:27.611 --> 54:29.806
She came with Iko CHOI earlier.

54:29.913 --> 54:30.971
What?

54:34.551 --> 54:37.920
Put her on wanted list and
get me everything on her.

54:37.921 --> 54:40.116
- Yes, sir.
- Congratulations, Lieutenant.

54:40.524 --> 54:42.890
This calls for a special promotion.

54:44.161 --> 54:47.653
Why are you taking me?

54:47.764 --> 54:51.495
I'm the victim here!

54:54.738 --> 54:58.941
They took our boss and
wrecked our casino.

54:58.942 --> 55:01.069
Call Sergeant Park.

55:01.478 --> 55:03.673
Find out which clan
put him up to this.

55:05.315 --> 55:06.339
Uh... boss?

55:07.417 --> 55:08.417
Look.

55:10.721 --> 55:11.588
<i>News just come in.</i>

55:11.589 --> 55:13.556
<i>Iko CHOI, the wanted fugitive,</i>

55:13.557 --> 55:16.651
<i>was spotted at an illegal
gambling establishment.</i>

55:17.894 --> 55:20.886
- Tae-ho!
- Mom!

55:22.866 --> 55:25.334
Leave my baby alone,
you shameless scumbags!

55:28.772 --> 55:30.137
He is an athlete.

55:37.614 --> 55:40.777
<i>Wanna catch the bastard?
Click this link.</i>

55:44.154 --> 55:46.019
What the heck?

55:50.527 --> 55:53.985
Bring in the best of our men!

55:54.931 --> 55:55.693
This is war.

55:55.799 --> 55:56.799
Yes, boss!

56:01.271 --> 56:02.761
Until when?

56:03.040 --> 56:05.941
Now, damn it! Right away!

56:07.644 --> 56:10.780
- <i>Several sightings of Iko CHOI</i>
- Did you hear that?

56:10.781 --> 56:11.947
<i>- At Seongsan 515. I repeat.</i>
- We've got his location.

56:11.948 --> 56:15.645
If we catch him again,

56:15.786 --> 56:18.454
everyone will get
a special promotion!

56:18.455 --> 56:19.455
Yes, sir!

56:21.425 --> 56:23.559
Are we looking at
the future Captain?

56:23.560 --> 56:26.256
It's not a dream but reality.
Step on it!

56:34.071 --> 56:35.071
Oh, shit!

56:37.074 --> 56:38.939
Ace?

56:40.343 --> 56:42.140
You should check this out
for yourself.

56:58.562 --> 56:59.586
Guru!

56:59.930 --> 57:01.261
Today's gonna be extra fun.

57:05.035 --> 57:07.799
We need to make some
adjustments to the plan.

57:54.351 --> 57:55.351
Listen.

57:55.418 --> 57:58.114
Your brother's in the stadium.

57:58.822 --> 57:59.822
<i>Iko!</i>

58:01.291 --> 58:02.315
Yeong-ho!

58:02.459 --> 58:03.619
<i>You alright, man?</i>

58:03.827 --> 58:05.124
Damn it, man!

58:05.462 --> 58:06.520
<i>You okay?</i>

58:06.963 --> 58:09.765
I have your finger.

58:09.766 --> 58:11.800
<i>Thanks, man. I appreciate that.</i>

58:11.801 --> 58:13.735
I can't believe this.

58:13.870 --> 58:15.770
It's been a while since
we last came here.

58:16.406 --> 58:20.365
Not since you knocked out
11 players.

58:20.477 --> 58:22.274
If it wasn't for your temper,

58:22.479 --> 58:24.208
you could've made
the national team.

58:24.881 --> 58:28.977
Remember that time when
Cha Bum came along.

58:29.085 --> 58:30.484
What are you talking about?

58:30.587 --> 58:33.715
Do you remember
where he was sitting?

58:34.224 --> 58:38.456
<i>I can't seem to remember...</i>

58:40.697 --> 58:43.257
Yeah, I know...
Cha Bum, Cha Bum...

58:43.466 --> 58:45.127
where was he sitting?

58:45.268 --> 58:47.293
I'm at where Cha Bum
was sitting... argh!

58:51.241 --> 58:52.640
Alright, alright.

58:55.712 --> 58:58.714
<i>Where would the psycho Iko beat?</i>

58:58.715 --> 59:00.046
Are you the one that texted?

59:01.451 --> 59:04.852
I'm chasing Iko, too.
I'll tell you where to go.

59:04.955 --> 59:06.047
Who are y...?

59:08.225 --> 59:10.625
- Come on. Get moving.
- Yes, sir.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.267
Why did he come here?

59:18.268 --> 59:21.136
Contact the control center.

59:21.137 --> 59:22.337
Let's get this son of a bitch!

59:22.772 --> 59:27.106
When you're on the ring, you should
only think about your opponent.

59:27.510 --> 59:31.571
<i>Offense is the best defense.</i>

59:33.049 --> 59:33.777
Understand?

59:33.883 --> 59:35.043
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

59:35.352 --> 59:39.686
You stay alert, too. Okay?

59:40.624 --> 59:43.525
I've never let my guard down
since the day you were born.

59:44.828 --> 59:47.263
<i>Now is not the time for tears</i>

59:47.264 --> 59:48.959
<i>but for celebration.</i>

59:49.332 --> 59:50.390
Peeping Tom?

59:50.567 --> 59:52.933
<i>Hey, brothers!</i>

59:53.570 --> 59:55.970
Welcome to the final stage!

59:57.207 --> 59:59.573
Not many horses
have made it this far.

59:59.776 --> 01:00:04.213
<i>Most died in an accident
or got shot by the police.</i>

01:00:04.347 --> 01:00:08.545
Even fewer have cleared
this final stage.

01:00:09.686 --> 01:00:13.087
If you want to know more,
ask the Red Angel.

01:00:13.189 --> 01:00:15.987
<i>Let's look on the bright side.</i>

01:00:16.126 --> 01:00:20.927
There's a jackpot waiting for
you at the end of this stage.

01:00:21.598 --> 01:00:27.264
An unimaginable sum of money
that you can't dream to spend!

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:28.869
Son of a bitch!

01:00:28.972 --> 01:00:33.275
- I'll break all your fingers!
- How dare you mess with my brother!

01:00:33.276 --> 01:00:37.042
You're already dead because
I'm gonna get you!

01:00:39.015 --> 01:00:42.084
I would look at this
in a different way.

01:00:42.085 --> 01:00:47.182
<i>It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
Like the title match you never had.</i>

01:00:47.524 --> 01:00:48.924
<i>Two sides of a coin.</i>

01:00:48.925 --> 01:00:50.449
A crisis can also
be an opportunity.

01:00:51.061 --> 01:00:56.328
<i>It's up to you what you get
out of this opportunity.</i>

01:00:56.433 --> 01:00:58.901
Succeed and you're going home
with a huge prize.

01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:01.334
<i>Although the chance
is fairly slim.</i>

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.205
What's it going to be
for the brave brothers?

01:01:05.842 --> 01:01:08.037
<i>I prepared something for you.</i>

01:01:11.648 --> 01:01:14.014
Time you got is 30 minutes.

01:01:14.184 --> 01:01:18.780
Find each other in that time,
and the bomb will disarm.

01:01:20.156 --> 01:01:25.150
But if you fail, the devices
on your ankles will go off.

01:01:26.663 --> 01:01:29.359
So, there is just one rule
to this game.

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.228
You stop, you die.

01:01:34.437 --> 01:01:36.805
Wow, this is so much fun!

01:01:36.806 --> 01:01:39.475
You fucking psycho!

01:01:39.476 --> 01:01:43.879
This is so exciting that
I'm gonna shit my pants!

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:48.747
<i>How are you gonna find
each other in this massive stadium?</i>

01:01:51.421 --> 01:01:54.754
You can get your hint
from the Red Angel.

01:01:55.558 --> 01:02:00.222
<i>Good things happen to those
with a positive mind. Showtime!</i>

01:02:06.336 --> 01:02:08.827
Don't look back and run.
Good luck.

01:02:17.147 --> 01:02:19.877
- Where do I go?
- Don't ask me that.

01:02:19.949 --> 01:02:22.850
- You have the hints.
- Not my business.

01:02:26.356 --> 01:02:27.414
Damn it.

01:02:29.159 --> 01:02:30.854
Guru, where do I go?

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.326
<i>Where do I go, man?</i>

01:02:41.738 --> 01:02:44.104
Are they my guests? Shit!

01:02:45.341 --> 01:02:48.401
No. Our guests.

01:02:48.711 --> 01:02:50.440
She's with him.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.381
It turns out
you're quite an athlete.

01:02:54.551 --> 01:02:56.452
You should've told me.

01:02:56.453 --> 01:02:59.820
Then, I would've prepared
more suitable equipment.

01:02:59.923 --> 01:03:03.689
This is all but a huge
misunderstanding.

01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:07.763
We're all being used, okay?

01:03:07.764 --> 01:03:08.958
Shut up!

01:03:09.499 --> 01:03:13.026
You get a grand
for every valid thrust.

01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:14.770
Send him home!

01:03:23.947 --> 01:03:25.346
<i>A pair play.</i>

01:04:02.252 --> 01:04:04.652
Where are these bastards now?

01:04:04.721 --> 01:04:07.087
Tell me. Where is my brother?

01:04:09.192 --> 01:04:11.319
Above your head.

01:04:22.572 --> 01:04:24.437
Do you even know where to go?

01:04:26.676 --> 01:04:28.007
Get the hell out of here.

01:04:29.812 --> 01:04:30.812
Now!

01:05:02.211 --> 01:05:03.269
There he is!

01:05:04.581 --> 01:05:07.516
Him or me, one of us
is gonna die tonight.

01:05:07.517 --> 01:05:08.517
Get him!

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.882
Wait, wait, wait.

01:05:12.722 --> 01:05:14.587
We have a new location. Zone F.

01:05:14.724 --> 01:05:16.316
F? That way.

01:05:18.394 --> 01:05:19.394
Out of my way!

01:05:22.165 --> 01:05:23.165
Move over.

01:05:23.566 --> 01:05:25.500
Go around the other side!

01:05:27.337 --> 01:05:28.497
Put your hands up!

01:05:31.674 --> 01:05:32.698
What do we do, sir?

01:05:35.612 --> 01:05:36.636
Do we fire?

01:05:37.246 --> 01:05:38.304
What's that on his ankle?

01:05:39.449 --> 01:05:40.449
Sir?

01:05:40.984 --> 01:05:43.077
Stop right there!

01:05:44.754 --> 01:05:46.551
What the?

01:05:58.134 --> 01:05:59.567
Inside!

01:06:02.005 --> 01:06:04.337
Who the hell are you?
Are you gangsters?

01:06:04.674 --> 01:06:05.971
What are you talking about?

01:06:06.275 --> 01:06:07.799
Go, Korea!

01:06:08.778 --> 01:06:11.246
- Louder!
- Go, Korea!

01:06:25.428 --> 01:06:26.622
Yeong-ho!

01:06:28.531 --> 01:06:29.531
Over here!

01:06:29.599 --> 01:06:31.692
I see you, man!

01:06:32.201 --> 01:06:33.964
I can smell you from here.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:36.630
Do you know why
I left the national team?

01:06:38.408 --> 01:06:42.640
Because of shoulder dislocation!

01:06:45.048 --> 01:06:48.108
Where is the bastard
behind all this?

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:55.885
My brother.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.100
Alright!

01:07:05.635 --> 01:07:06.693
Iko!

01:07:29.325 --> 01:07:32.761
Section 4,
'25 min and over' wins.

01:07:35.031 --> 01:07:37.659
Iko! Iko, man!

01:07:38.434 --> 01:07:40.698
Listen.
We're running out of time.

01:07:40.803 --> 01:07:44.637
Don't think about finding me.
Find the son of a bitch first.

01:07:44.841 --> 01:07:46.331
I'll take care of myself.

01:07:46.476 --> 01:07:49.138
Go to the sky box!
That's our only chance.

01:07:49.979 --> 01:07:52.379
Don't worry about me, okay?

01:07:53.382 --> 01:07:57.045
Once a fighter beckons under pressure
that's the end of him.

01:08:01.057 --> 01:08:03.355
The highlight of the day!

01:08:04.093 --> 01:08:06.061
Ladies and gentlemen,
a stadium roulette.

01:08:06.195 --> 01:08:07.992
Red versus black.

01:08:08.865 --> 01:08:14.804
Where will the fireworks go off?

01:08:15.138 --> 01:08:17.868
Place your final bets now.

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.779
<i>We lost him again.</i>

01:08:30.252 --> 01:08:31.720
But he's here.

01:08:33.523 --> 01:08:34.523
Here...

01:08:36.192 --> 01:08:37.216
Right here.

01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:44.156
On the roof?

01:09:02.852 --> 01:09:07.755
Sons of bitches!
You know what Iko's nickname was...

01:09:07.857 --> 01:09:09.916
Evacuate. I have a bomb!

01:09:10.393 --> 01:09:11.758
Back in his soccer playing days?

01:09:12.161 --> 01:09:16.791
A 'Forward who never returns'!

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:20.528
We're having an exciting game
thanks to a solid script.

01:09:24.407 --> 01:09:27.035
He's the best horse we've had.
Give him a little bonus.

01:09:27.844 --> 01:09:29.607
How about you go all in?

01:09:36.652 --> 01:09:38.586
You gotta put the sail up
when there is wind.

01:09:39.121 --> 01:09:40.611
Man, it's getting hot.

01:09:41.357 --> 01:09:43.325
They're betting big time.

01:09:44.694 --> 01:09:48.185
4 on red and 6 on black.
Grand total, 100 million. No more bets!

01:09:59.242 --> 01:10:00.242
Go further.

01:10:01.077 --> 01:10:02.077
Go on.

01:10:02.712 --> 01:10:03.872
Go if you dare!

01:10:04.213 --> 01:10:06.545
- Christ!
- What? What?

01:10:06.616 --> 01:10:09.016
Are you gonna jump?

01:10:09.352 --> 01:10:11.149
I'll follow you to the end.

01:10:16.225 --> 01:10:20.355
- God damn it!
- To the end, you fucking bastard...

01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:27.029
Don't let go, man!

01:10:37.513 --> 01:10:40.038
There are men who are playing us.

01:10:40.516 --> 01:10:42.177
We've got to catch them.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.119
Is this the end for you?

01:10:48.891 --> 01:10:50.722
Good playing. Bye.

01:11:11.514 --> 01:11:14.149
<i>Go to the sky box!
Whatever it takes.</i>

01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:15.481
Attack with V.

01:11:15.584 --> 01:11:17.415
<i>Go!</i>

01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:25.718
If you've got no imagination,
you have no wings!

01:11:32.068 --> 01:11:33.068
Huh?

01:12:07.903 --> 01:12:09.598
It didn't go off!

01:12:10.106 --> 01:12:12.097
Iko, my baby!

01:12:12.675 --> 01:12:15.075
You fearless bastard.

01:12:15.177 --> 01:12:18.169
You decided to break in head first?

01:12:21.684 --> 01:12:24.847
Ace, I'm bleeding!

01:12:25.287 --> 01:12:26.811
What the hell?

01:12:42.104 --> 01:12:44.868
<i>Is it a fall through?</i>

01:12:47.576 --> 01:12:51.034
Yes... The game is null and void.

01:12:51.447 --> 01:12:52.447
<i>Null and void?</i>

01:12:55.584 --> 01:12:57.518
<i>What a crazy bastard!</i>

01:12:57.653 --> 01:13:01.555
<i>Ace got punched in the face by a lunatic.</i>

01:13:02.691 --> 01:13:04.591
<i>Your game is shit.</i>

01:13:31.987 --> 01:13:33.386
It's too hot.

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:36.350
I'll let you cool down
before I eat you.

01:13:38.961 --> 01:13:40.929
We're shutting down the game.
Get everybody.

01:13:42.998 --> 01:13:46.627
Everyone, return to base.

01:13:47.136 --> 01:13:49.127
Damn soccer.

01:14:14.463 --> 01:14:15.463
Hey!

01:14:15.998 --> 01:14:17.192
What the hell?

01:14:27.443 --> 01:14:30.037
Sugar Park disappeared.

01:14:30.646 --> 01:14:32.580
Su-kyung Kim...

01:14:37.953 --> 01:14:40.444
Do you have anything?

01:14:40.756 --> 01:14:43.458
Keep an eye on the crazy woman.

01:14:43.459 --> 01:14:44.659
Yes, sir.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:45.660
Here, sir!

01:14:47.463 --> 01:14:50.990
What the hell? Fire away.

01:14:52.134 --> 01:14:55.262
I got this off an informant
in sports gambling business.

01:14:55.471 --> 01:14:56.995
The mystery girl, Su-kyung Kim,

01:14:57.106 --> 01:15:00.608
is a former boxer who was
barred for match fixing.

01:15:00.609 --> 01:15:05.280
She got 300 hours of community service
and a 3-year suspended sentence.

01:15:05.281 --> 01:15:09.809
She had some financial issues
with her coach

01:15:09.919 --> 01:15:13.047
until the coach got killed
suspiciously.

01:15:14.123 --> 01:15:15.283
That's all I got.

01:15:18.894 --> 01:15:20.555
The entire video
surveillance data

01:15:22.198 --> 01:15:25.190
from the big ass stadium
was wiped clean.

01:15:26.502 --> 01:15:28.265
Does that make sense to you?

01:15:29.505 --> 01:15:33.100
And what was that thing
strapped on his ankle?

01:15:35.377 --> 01:15:37.868
There is definitely
something going on.

01:15:39.715 --> 01:15:42.912
I can't figure out what.

01:16:00.269 --> 01:16:01.361
Listen.

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.431
You broke the rules on your end.

01:16:04.506 --> 01:16:08.237
But I'm still willing to do
my final delivery

01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:09.568
on one condition.

01:16:09.912 --> 01:16:11.937
<i>You'll pay me ten times
what you normally pay.</i>

01:16:12.381 --> 01:16:14.440
<i>Take the deal and
the horse is yours.</i>

01:16:29.732 --> 01:16:33.099
Where did you bring me?

01:16:33.369 --> 01:16:36.236
Stop! You're hurting me!

01:16:37.506 --> 01:16:41.067
Your brother is still alive.
I can guarantee that.

01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:43.005
Let go of me!

01:16:43.312 --> 01:16:46.080
You make one wrong move,
it's over for you two!

01:16:46.081 --> 01:16:47.241
Over, my ass!

01:16:47.916 --> 01:16:52.012
This is only
the beginning for me.

01:16:53.322 --> 01:16:54.822
Now you'll tell me your name,
who you are

01:16:54.823 --> 01:16:58.259
and about the peeping Tom
that you're working for.

01:17:02.464 --> 01:17:03.988
What's going on?

01:17:17.479 --> 01:17:20.846
Are you a thug?

01:17:24.219 --> 01:17:25.550
No, sir. A friend.

01:17:27.923 --> 01:17:30.653
You're a jock?

01:17:53.849 --> 01:17:56.044
She's pretty, right?
My champion.

01:17:58.487 --> 01:18:00.819
<i>You trust me, don't you?</i>

01:18:01.123 --> 01:18:02.283
<i>I need your help.</i>

01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:10.029
This should be the right address.

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.324
Jae-yeol.

01:18:15.104 --> 01:18:16.104
Jae-yeol!

01:18:27.049 --> 01:18:29.643
Disappear quietly
if you want to live.

01:18:30.352 --> 01:18:32.912
You know better than
to mess with Ace.

01:18:33.489 --> 01:18:35.889
Don't try anything.
Bring the horse over by 8:00 pm.

01:18:36.158 --> 01:18:37.386
The meeting point is...

01:18:39.728 --> 01:18:42.196
<i>I thought I had
no business with you.</i>

01:18:42.297 --> 01:18:46.134
<i>The crazy horse
ruined everything.</i>

01:18:46.135 --> 01:18:48.160
<i>Another game?</i>

01:18:48.437 --> 01:18:51.201
It's gonna be nothing like
what you've ever seen.

01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:57.537
The horse is still alive.
The game is still valid.

01:18:57.679 --> 01:18:59.781
<i>You messed up.</i>

01:18:59.782 --> 01:19:01.579
<i>So, who's the other horse?</i>

01:19:04.319 --> 01:19:06.719
A horse that's tested and proven.

01:19:08.557 --> 01:19:13.722
The big match is going to be
a chicken game.

01:19:14.797 --> 01:19:17.664
I'm putting my own neck on this.

01:19:19.067 --> 01:19:23.197
<i>It's all for fun.
Don't be so serious.</i>

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:29.901
So, it's a secret gambling club
for special few members.

01:19:30.012 --> 01:19:32.713
Because the participants
only logon and off,

01:19:32.714 --> 01:19:36.411
they cannot be incriminated.

01:19:36.652 --> 01:19:39.314
What an evil bunch!

01:19:39.955 --> 01:19:43.015
Iko, do you know
who protects this world?

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.018
It's the officer workers like us.
What do we do at work?

01:19:48.597 --> 01:19:51.157
We spread and spread!

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.867
So, you'll expose them online?

01:19:56.972 --> 01:19:58.234
That's right!

01:19:58.607 --> 01:20:01.974
I'll make it my mission
to expose them.

01:20:07.382 --> 01:20:10.885
What's her role?
She knows well about them,

01:20:10.886 --> 01:20:12.366
I'm sure there's
something she can do.

01:20:14.456 --> 01:20:16.651
She'll connect me back to them

01:20:16.992 --> 01:20:18.755
by handing me over to them.

01:20:19.294 --> 01:20:20.294
Right?

01:20:20.362 --> 01:20:22.730
Man, how is that helping you?

01:20:22.731 --> 01:20:24.699
She's just selling you out.

01:20:25.133 --> 01:20:27.533
From now, you're getting
your hands off this.

01:20:28.203 --> 01:20:31.866
We'll get the bad guys.
You look after your father.

01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:33.467
Iko...

01:20:35.978 --> 01:20:37.206
we protect

01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:43.249
our women.

01:20:48.991 --> 01:20:50.151
Our women?

01:20:56.732 --> 01:20:57.858
What's he on about?

01:20:58.367 --> 01:20:59.367
Iko?

01:21:15.817 --> 01:21:18.843
<i>This clip is going viral
on the internet.</i>

01:21:19.288 --> 01:21:21.415
<i>Listen, Iko just called.</i>

01:21:22.024 --> 01:21:25.983
<i>He said not to worry
and just wait for him, okay?</i>

01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:27.888
You see how your uncle
is alright?

01:21:28.096 --> 01:21:29.290
Yeah...

01:21:32.935 --> 01:21:35.130
when does he run?

01:21:36.171 --> 01:21:37.570
When dad...

01:21:38.941 --> 01:21:41.603
It means your dad is fine, too.

01:21:41.977 --> 01:21:43.239
Okay.

01:21:45.681 --> 01:21:46.875
Now swallow.

01:21:48.016 --> 01:21:49.016
Come here, baby.

01:21:51.553 --> 01:21:55.182
Both your dad and uncle are fine.

01:21:56.692 --> 01:21:58.557
And they're coming home soon.

01:22:04.232 --> 01:22:08.191
Do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?

01:22:08.637 --> 01:22:10.195
And Ace...

01:22:10.339 --> 01:22:13.638
he controls your life and
money on his smart phone.

01:22:13.809 --> 01:22:16.403
He has the world
at his finger tips.

01:22:17.212 --> 01:22:19.942
He has no weak spot.
He can't be caught.

01:22:31.693 --> 01:22:32.693
Here we are.

01:22:37.466 --> 01:22:38.626
Relax.

01:22:39.868 --> 01:22:41.995
Just do as he tells you.

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:45.139
Lose if he wants you to.
Just do as he says.

01:22:45.273 --> 01:22:48.401
Anyone who survived
did just that.

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:51.679
You have what it takes.
Just remember...

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.045
what does it feel like

01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:55.981
to be champion?

01:23:00.622 --> 01:23:02.021
Hey, champion!

01:23:03.959 --> 01:23:05.119
I'm so jealous!

01:23:27.916 --> 01:23:28.916
Iko!

01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:04.245
Iko's life depends on us.

01:24:04.352 --> 01:24:07.719
Don't worry
about breaking the law.

01:24:07.856 --> 01:24:11.019
Let's show the world how
the office men fight the evil.

01:24:11.793 --> 01:24:15.092
When the data is overloaded
and temporarily freezes,

01:24:15.197 --> 01:24:17.791
we locate the frequency
that get recovered first.

01:24:18.667 --> 01:24:19.793
You got it.

01:24:20.202 --> 01:24:23.763
Do you know why this company
is called ADT?

01:24:24.072 --> 01:24:27.473
We're the UDT
of frequency locators.

01:24:40.922 --> 01:24:42.389
<i>It's D-Dos time!</i>

01:24:42.557 --> 01:24:43.319
<i>Ready?</i>

01:24:43.425 --> 01:24:44.425
On your marks,

01:24:44.426 --> 01:24:45.188
get set,

01:24:45.293 --> 01:24:46.293
go!

01:24:53.568 --> 01:24:54.568
Hello?

01:24:59.574 --> 01:25:00.666
What the hell?

01:25:19.728 --> 01:25:20.387
Random!

01:25:20.595 --> 01:25:21.755
That's him! This one!

01:25:22.731 --> 01:25:24.631
So much for a genius hacker.

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.232
Okay, we got you.

01:25:44.986 --> 01:25:47.045
I'm counting on you, Jae-yeol.

01:25:49.825 --> 01:25:50.825
What the hell?

01:25:50.892 --> 01:25:52.484
This guy is a goddamn Pentagon.

01:25:52.627 --> 01:25:54.527
What are you talking about?

01:25:54.796 --> 01:25:56.821
Find a way somehow!

01:26:01.403 --> 01:26:02.927
<i>Welcome back, Iko CHOI.</i>

01:26:03.772 --> 01:26:07.538
<i>Let's have fun, shall we?</i>

01:26:07.876 --> 01:26:11.505
Stop talking shit to me
from behind the camera.

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.204
Let's meet face to face.

01:26:15.617 --> 01:26:17.414
I've got something
special for you.

01:26:31.199 --> 01:26:35.226
You know, the underworld is
way bigger than the real.

01:26:35.737 --> 01:26:41.004
<i>The MMA world is in a big scandal
with Iko CHOI.</i>

01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:47.173
<i>CHOI is most likely to be
permanently expelled...</i>

01:27:00.428 --> 01:27:06.389
<i>If you die, all your debt
will go to your family.</i>

01:27:07.402 --> 01:27:08.528
<i>So, how about it?</i>

01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:13.330
<i>Work for me to pay off your
debt and protect your family.</i>

01:27:17.979 --> 01:27:19.776
I said I was out.

01:27:23.118 --> 01:27:30.081
An exclusive championship match
reserved only for the special seven.

01:27:31.393 --> 01:27:34.226
A death match between
a Russian horse fighting for money

01:27:34.362 --> 01:27:39.095
versus Zombie fighting
for his brother.

01:27:41.102 --> 01:27:43.627
They'll fight until one dies.

01:27:56.885 --> 01:27:57.681
Yeong-ho!

01:27:57.752 --> 01:27:59.913
- You okay?
- Run, Iko!

01:28:14.069 --> 01:28:15.730
Why did you come here, idiot?

01:28:17.505 --> 01:28:20.406
These men are complete lunatics.

01:28:22.777 --> 01:28:24.005
Put the gloves on.

01:28:24.212 --> 01:28:25.406
Bring on the game.

01:28:29.985 --> 01:28:32.453
We don't have much time.
It's Seoul Station.

01:28:32.554 --> 01:28:34.454
I'm going there to save Iko.

01:28:34.589 --> 01:28:38.025
<i>Ace, the mastermind behind
all this is also there.</i>

01:28:38.727 --> 01:28:40.427
<i>Iko didn't bashed up your casino.</i>

01:28:40.428 --> 01:28:42.726
<i>- It wasn't his fault.</i>
- Let's go for next round.

01:28:43.064 --> 01:28:45.294
<i>Let's all meet there!</i>

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:48.102
<i>It's near Seoul Station.</i>

01:28:48.103 --> 01:28:49.103
Pack your gears.

01:28:49.170 --> 01:28:50.967
This guy is a ghost.

01:28:51.039 --> 01:28:53.166
This is a military program.

01:28:53.274 --> 01:28:56.539
<i>It can't be tracked down.</i>

01:29:04.352 --> 01:29:06.343
Track down the signal
from this bracelet.

01:29:06.454 --> 01:29:08.622
That's where Iko is.

01:29:08.623 --> 01:29:10.591
Ace will be close by, too.

01:29:10.592 --> 01:29:12.116
What?

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:15.525
That's where their server is.

01:29:15.597 --> 01:29:16.723
Can you do this?

01:29:16.831 --> 01:29:20.232
Wait! Wait!

01:29:23.972 --> 01:29:25.997
When you find it, stick this in.

01:29:32.113 --> 01:29:33.171
Iko!

01:29:33.581 --> 01:29:35.310
I have a better view from here.

01:29:37.085 --> 01:29:40.543
You know what his weakness is,
don't you?

01:29:40.989 --> 01:29:44.425
His weak spot is...

01:29:46.861 --> 01:29:48.260
I don't know either.

01:29:54.736 --> 01:29:57.704
The bastard has gained weight.

01:29:57.705 --> 01:29:58.831
Don't get your eyes off him.

01:30:04.646 --> 01:30:05.646
Jab! Jab!

01:30:05.914 --> 01:30:07.211
One, two!

01:30:07.582 --> 01:30:08.582
That's my boy.

01:30:09.384 --> 01:30:10.681
Where is it supposed to be?

01:30:12.253 --> 01:30:15.051
It's right there.
I'm getting two sets of signals.

01:30:28.269 --> 01:30:29.429
<i>This is awesome, Ace!</i>

01:30:30.638 --> 01:30:33.664
Wake up, Iko!

01:30:34.576 --> 01:30:36.066
Give him a choke!

01:30:36.511 --> 01:30:39.207
Choke! That's it!

01:30:57.265 --> 01:30:59.233
Where are you?

01:30:59.434 --> 01:31:00.628
Where are you hiding, Ace?

01:31:14.082 --> 01:31:15.582
Breathe, man.

01:31:15.583 --> 01:31:16.982
Keep breathing!

01:31:17.085 --> 01:31:18.245
Damn it.

01:31:23.158 --> 01:31:26.150
Uh-oh, your brother is
going to die because of you.

01:31:26.227 --> 01:31:29.219
He doesn't deserve this.

01:31:30.865 --> 01:31:32.633
I'm alright, I'm alright!

01:31:32.634 --> 01:31:34.795
The bastard is on drugs!

01:31:34.903 --> 01:31:37.531
Iko, are you a quitter?

01:31:37.805 --> 01:31:40.865
Remember, if you die
so will your brother.

01:31:40.975 --> 01:31:44.411
Go, you indefatigable bastard!

01:31:45.747 --> 01:31:47.814
There are two reasons for
a man to fight to death.

01:31:47.815 --> 01:31:50.050
Money or family?

01:31:50.051 --> 01:31:55.011
Why don't you raise the stake
and go all in with the money?

01:31:55.156 --> 01:31:57.181
<i>I'll bet on money.</i>

01:31:57.292 --> 01:31:59.260
<i>Man, that's a champion.</i>

01:32:01.396 --> 01:32:05.890
How long should I put up with you
and live off the commission?

01:32:14.776 --> 01:32:18.974
Guru, transfer everything
quietly to the last penny.

01:32:39.534 --> 01:32:41.195
<i>A little to the right.
A little more.</i>

01:32:42.136 --> 01:32:44.036
Steady... steady...

01:32:44.272 --> 01:32:45.705
Right there!

01:32:45.773 --> 01:32:47.297
- Where?
<i>- I think you're there!</i>

01:32:50.578 --> 01:32:52.546
Wait.

01:32:53.381 --> 01:32:57.317
Maybe it's not. No, it's not.

01:32:58.786 --> 01:33:00.083
Hurry up!

01:33:04.993 --> 01:33:07.052
That's it. Come on!

01:33:07.195 --> 01:33:09.288
Go, pound!

01:33:17.505 --> 01:33:18.597
Did you check both sides?

01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:20.230
It's done.

01:33:33.554 --> 01:33:34.634
<i>A little more to the right.</i>

01:33:35.223 --> 01:33:37.123
Wait, stop!

01:33:38.026 --> 01:33:39.118
There!

01:33:43.798 --> 01:33:45.163
That's it!

01:33:45.967 --> 01:33:46.967
Is that...

01:33:48.269 --> 01:33:49.395
Andrei?

01:33:50.171 --> 01:33:51.171
What the?

01:33:51.172 --> 01:33:52.332
This is incredible.

01:33:53.141 --> 01:33:55.507
Let's get to work.

01:33:55.710 --> 01:33:58.178
Twitter, YouTube
and everything else.

01:33:58.279 --> 01:33:59.837
Keep uploading and sharing.

01:34:00.148 --> 01:34:02.309
Power on all monitors!

01:34:06.587 --> 01:34:07.611
Cool!

01:34:11.059 --> 01:34:13.860
<i>We need a warrant for that.</i>

01:34:13.861 --> 01:34:15.726
I don't care, just do it!

01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:16.963
I'm almost there, too.

01:34:16.964 --> 01:34:18.397
Yes, sir.

01:34:21.369 --> 01:34:22.369
Let's go.

01:34:23.237 --> 01:34:24.237
Where?

01:34:25.506 --> 01:34:26.506
I said go!

01:34:26.941 --> 01:34:28.135
Alright!

01:34:35.983 --> 01:34:37.416
Great job, my boy!

01:34:40.321 --> 01:34:41.652
How do you undo this?

01:34:42.323 --> 01:34:43.990
No... Step back!

01:34:43.991 --> 01:34:44.991
Behind you!

01:34:45.126 --> 01:34:46.559
He's up again!

01:34:46.627 --> 01:34:48.117
Hey!

01:35:04.612 --> 01:35:05.612
What the heck?

01:35:15.857 --> 01:35:17.290
Wake up, Iko!

01:35:17.792 --> 01:35:19.953
Hang in there, man.

01:35:22.063 --> 01:35:23.826
Andrei, you bastard!

01:35:24.232 --> 01:35:26.632
Iko!

01:35:28.903 --> 01:35:31.064
You've been exposed, asshole.

01:35:33.574 --> 01:35:34.574
Hey!

01:35:36.411 --> 01:35:38.003
You can't hit a woman.

01:35:40.548 --> 01:35:41.708
What are you, a thug?

01:35:51.058 --> 01:35:53.083
What's happening?

01:35:59.333 --> 01:36:00.766
Look!

01:36:01.869 --> 01:36:02.869
Cut off the feed.

01:36:10.778 --> 01:36:11.778
Cut it off now!

01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.608
I can't!

01:36:13.815 --> 01:36:15.612
Is it a virus?

01:36:16.818 --> 01:36:22.313
<i>- Is it time for Ace to stop?
- Good bye.</i>

01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:31.098
- Block off all the exits!
- Yes, sir!

01:36:33.201 --> 01:36:34.293
Iko!

01:36:34.402 --> 01:36:35.562
Wake up!

01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:36.870
Iko!

01:36:38.306 --> 01:36:39.534
Stop, Andrei!

01:36:40.374 --> 01:36:41.898
That's enough. Stop!

01:36:44.812 --> 01:36:45.904
What's he doing?

01:36:46.013 --> 01:36:48.277
Don't just take it all!

01:36:48.616 --> 01:36:50.049
Come on, get up!

01:36:50.585 --> 01:36:51.745
Get up!

01:36:52.186 --> 01:36:53.483
Stop, Andrei!

01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:07.192
Iko!

01:37:07.935 --> 01:37:09.698
Everyone is watching you!

01:37:10.204 --> 01:37:13.230
We're being broadcasted live!

01:37:13.674 --> 01:37:16.939
Everyone is watching!

01:37:17.078 --> 01:37:20.775
Open your eyes, man!

01:37:28.823 --> 01:37:31.053
What's wrong with this?

01:38:27.949 --> 01:38:29.075
Did you win?

01:38:44.799 --> 01:38:46.790
Bring in the forensic team.

01:38:52.173 --> 01:38:53.231
There's a man.

01:38:57.345 --> 01:38:58.345
We got them!

01:38:58.846 --> 01:39:00.438
We caught the bastards!

01:39:03.951 --> 01:39:07.682
Give them Miranda, okay?

01:39:08.956 --> 01:39:10.056
Who the hell are you?

01:39:10.057 --> 01:39:12.617
Me? "Go, Korea!"

01:39:12.693 --> 01:39:14.527
From the stadium!

01:39:14.528 --> 01:39:17.520
- Arrest them all.
- Yes, sir.

01:39:17.898 --> 01:39:19.229
Why me?

01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:20.925
Come on.

01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:24.438
What did I do?

01:39:30.544 --> 01:39:31.544
My back!

01:39:38.886 --> 01:39:42.185
- Can you help us?
- Please, help us.

01:39:43.924 --> 01:39:45.221
Please, help us.

01:39:46.394 --> 01:39:50.057
<i>The game's not over, Iko.</i>

01:39:50.431 --> 01:39:52.991
How about some face time?

01:39:55.002 --> 01:39:57.766
I gotta get this motherfucker.

01:39:57.938 --> 01:39:59.599
Can you manage from here?

01:39:59.807 --> 01:40:00.967
Go to the police!

01:40:01.542 --> 01:40:02.839
Don't go, man!

01:40:18.959 --> 01:40:20.085
Hey!

01:40:21.996 --> 01:40:23.293
Peeping Tom?

01:40:29.203 --> 01:40:30.966
Damn it!

01:40:32.173 --> 01:40:33.936
You little asshole!

01:40:40.247 --> 01:40:45.879
You really are one crazy
son of a bitch to come back.

01:40:51.759 --> 01:40:53.624
Running away again?

01:40:55.930 --> 01:40:58.364
I never expected you
to whip up a scheme.

01:40:59.467 --> 01:41:02.925
I should've planned another round.

01:41:03.571 --> 01:41:06.369
Shall we start over?

01:41:11.979 --> 01:41:14.038
What the hell is this?

01:41:16.617 --> 01:41:18.175
You!

01:41:24.325 --> 01:41:25.883
You bastard!

01:41:27.862 --> 01:41:30.330
Show your face, asshole!

01:41:35.169 --> 01:41:36.609
Can I get a sample of
Zombie's punch?

01:41:48.582 --> 01:41:50.573
You look like you need a rest!

01:41:51.952 --> 01:41:53.214
Come on!

01:41:53.754 --> 01:41:55.346
Is that all you've got?

01:41:55.923 --> 01:41:58.016
You're within my range.

01:42:04.398 --> 01:42:05.990
Jeez, you're scaring me!

01:42:08.769 --> 01:42:12.000
You're my horse!

01:42:12.206 --> 01:42:14.037
You run at my whip

01:42:14.141 --> 01:42:16.976
and wag your tail
when I give you carrots.

01:42:16.977 --> 01:42:20.674
Just do as I tell you
until you drop dead!

01:42:21.448 --> 01:42:25.885
How dare you try to out smart me?

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:28.579
Put a dent in my perfect plan?

01:42:30.691 --> 01:42:34.821
Only I decide when the game ends.

01:42:39.433 --> 01:42:41.060
Says who?

01:42:47.174 --> 01:42:48.505
Okay!

01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:06.285
Hey!

01:43:18.639 --> 01:43:19.731
Mister...

01:43:22.243 --> 01:43:24.108
Don't call me that.

01:43:49.603 --> 01:43:50.603
Hey...

01:43:52.006 --> 01:43:53.735
what happened to your face?

01:44:04.018 --> 01:44:05.349
You alright?

01:44:09.623 --> 01:44:12.456
What's the matter with you?

01:44:14.161 --> 01:44:15.753
I can't breathe.

01:44:21.335 --> 01:44:22.632
Champion.

01:44:22.903 --> 01:44:25.736
We found them, Lieutenant!

01:44:37.251 --> 01:44:39.913
It's all in here.

01:44:40.321 --> 01:44:47.159
We had a clear understanding
of the situation from the early stage

01:44:47.461 --> 01:44:52.098
and were able to deliver
a successful crackdown...

01:44:52.099 --> 01:44:54.659
This is the hot clip
that we secured.

01:44:55.936 --> 01:44:57.270
Did you see that?

01:44:57.271 --> 01:44:58.504
The best takedown in history!

01:44:58.505 --> 01:45:01.507
The police have cracked down
on an illegal gambling ring

01:45:01.508 --> 01:45:05.069
that have kidnapped and
used innocent citizens...

01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:13.944
Handcuffs, sir.

01:45:15.789 --> 01:45:16.789
That's okay.

01:45:31.405 --> 01:45:35.967
From tonight,
we're all Iko's fans.

01:45:36.110 --> 01:45:37.168
Yes, boss.

01:45:37.244 --> 01:45:38.541
Real loyal fans.

01:45:51.658 --> 01:45:53.819
Iko! Iko!

01:45:54.194 --> 01:45:56.458
Are you alright?

01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:58.192
Thank God, you're alive.

01:45:58.465 --> 01:46:00.800
Where is my husband?

01:46:00.801 --> 01:46:02.402
- Where is he?
- Stop it, please.

01:46:02.403 --> 01:46:04.098
Look, it's Yeong-ho CHOI!

01:46:16.283 --> 01:46:18.478
- Let me through...
- Yeong-ho!

01:46:19.153 --> 01:46:20.814
Are you alright?

01:46:21.789 --> 01:46:27.026
I told you to do business,
not bash up your face like this.

01:46:27.027 --> 01:46:28.221
Aw, that hurts!

01:46:28.796 --> 01:46:29.922
Where's Iko?

01:46:30.431 --> 01:46:31.728
He's fine!

01:46:41.909 --> 01:46:43.137
Did you get him?

01:46:51.118 --> 01:46:52.551
Let's go, man.

01:46:54.421 --> 01:46:56.946
We've got road work tomorrow.

01:46:57.458 --> 01:47:00.689
- Road work?
- What the hell, man?

01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:07.366
Hey, can you put this finger
in ice?

01:47:07.634 --> 01:47:10.000
You finally got your wish.

01:47:10.204 --> 01:47:13.640
You're on 9 o'clock news.

01:47:14.675 --> 01:47:17.906
I don't know
what I'll do about you.

01:47:18.745 --> 01:47:25.218
