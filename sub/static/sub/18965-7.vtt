someone in my classroom

claiming to be
the new teacher?

00:21.605 --> 00:24.107
It's not your classroom,
Miss Thatcher. It's the town's.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.193
Answer my question.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.487
A letter
in your employment file

00:28.487 --> 00:29.780
was brought to my attention,

00:29.780 --> 00:31.114
and given the contents,

00:31.114 --> 00:32.908
well, I was forced
to replace you.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.242
What letter?

00:38.413 --> 00:39.623
According to this,

00:39.623 --> 00:41.458
you used
your family's influence

00:41.458 --> 00:44.211

of financial gain

00:44.211 --> 00:47.046
to secure
your first teaching assignment.

00:47.046 --> 00:49.508
It's quite a serious allegation.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.718
That isn't true.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.595
Well, it is, according
to Thomas Higgins.

for the Western Territories,

00:56.807 --> 00:59.518

01:01.102 --> 01:03.522
He was the Superintendent
in Hamilton,

01:03.522 --> 01:04.940
before I moved here.

01:04.940 --> 01:07.026
Well, then, apparently,
he can be trusted.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.986
He's lying.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.529
He is
a well-respected official,

Ray Wyatt isn't

01:35.262 --> 01:37.264
the kind of man who's used
to being told what to do.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.767
There's no doubt that Gowen
is in Mr. Wyatt's pocket.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.435
All that talk of
expanding the school,

01:41.435 --> 01:43.437
and he was planning on
getting rid of me all long.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.146
That letter
is a forgery, Elizabeth.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.607
We're gonna prove it,

01:46.607 --> 01:49.109
and you're gonna be back
in that classroom in no time,

01:49.109 --> 01:51.278

It isn't a forgery, Jack.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.821

You'd never bribe anyone.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.952
No, and I didn't.

01:57.952 --> 02:00.203
But when my mother heard
Higgins was sending me West,

02:00.203 --> 02:03.082
she tried to use
influence and money

02:03.082 --> 02:04.458
to keep me
in Hamilton.

But you didn't
take the job in Hamilton.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.753
No. I turned it down

write the letter?

he made...

02:20.015 --> 02:21.767

Oh, Elizabeth.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.938
I turned him down.
Of course you did.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.689
And that made him angry.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.150
I just never realized how much.
He must've written the letter

02:30.150 --> 02:32.444
as soon as
I started working here.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.404
So you didn't know
about it until now?

02:34.404 --> 02:37.783
Right, but now that
the letter has come to light...

02:38.867 --> 02:40.995

to teach anymore.
