WEBVTT

00:02.636 --> 00:04.582
If I take something to help me sleep...

00:04.638 --> 00:06.481
I'll be groggy for the meeting.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.987
But if I don't take anything and I don't sleep,
I'll be groggy for the meeting, you know?

00:10.044 --> 00:11.546
Yeah.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.889
I was up for reelection as social chair
of our local Realtors group.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.826
The vote was tonight.

00:16.884 --> 00:20.093
I was so nervous,
I could barely hear Claire's pep talk.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.498
Why did I beg Mitchell
to introduce me to this developer?

00:22.556 --> 00:24.297
You're right. We'll know soon enough.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.565
Gonna go upstairs, see if I can
get some sleep. Love you. Mwah.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.300
I hope so too.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.601
Hello? Hey, Gil.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.407
No, no, no. You-You didn't wake me.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.444
Um, so, you hear anything, or-

00:40.841 --> 00:43.048
Hey, Dunphy. Just wrapping up
a phone call with this jackass.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.488
I gotta run, Dunphy. I got a late meeting
with some jackass.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.992
What's going on- What's going on?

00:48.049 --> 00:50.051
The people have spoken, Dunphy. I'm in.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.927
You're out. Sorry to have to
tell you that in private.

00:52.987 --> 00:55.228
- Was it even close?
- No!

00:55.289 --> 00:58.099
I have a mandate.
Not the kind you hide from your wife either.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.900
I can't believe it. I'm a one-termer?

00:59.960 --> 01:02.907
That puts me alongside
Henry Eustace Tyler and Art Wagner.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.635
Never met Art Wagner.

01:04.697 --> 01:08.009
- They took away his Realtor's license after Gategate.
- Huh.

01:08.069 --> 01:10.606
Okay, enough history, Dun-for.
Fork over the hardware.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.742
Gil, as my predecessor told me...

01:12.807 --> 01:15.879
respect the office,
respect the medallion.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.213
Ooh, shiny.
How often do you clean this thing?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.317
- Every time I shower.
- Well, don't worry.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.918
It's gonna get a good buffing tonight...

01:22.983 --> 01:24.860
when it's swinging against
the back of my wife's head.

01:24.919 --> 01:28.366
- Oh, yeah!
- That is not respecting the medallion!

01:30.124 --> 01:32.001
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:32.059 --> 01:34.096
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:34.161 --> 01:36.198
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:36.263 --> 01:38.174
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:38.232 --> 01:39.404
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:44.939 --> 01:47.351
So, after we pick up
my allergy medication...

01:47.408 --> 01:49.547
you drop Manny and I at the museum.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.112
Why do you even have to go?

01:51.178 --> 01:53.681
Ay. other mothers are going
to the field trip too.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.090
Don't worry.

01:55.149 --> 01:58.028
I'm not going to be all over you,
trying to suffocate you.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.587
Don't talk like that.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.929
I hate crowded elevators.

02:01.989 --> 02:05.664
Only one thing worse-
when they stop and you get trapped.

02:08.996 --> 02:12.239
Actually, there's one thing
even worse than that.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.303
It's okay, sir.
There's no need to panic.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.009
Getting trapped with him.

02:18.072 --> 02:20.552
I don't even know the guy's name.
He belongs to my club.

02:20.608 --> 02:25.148
But for whatever reason,
he has the knack for showing up...

02:25.212 --> 02:27.715
when I'm at my absolute worst.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.653
- Be right back.
- Mm-hmm.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.500
Here, let me help you.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.603
- Maybe we should help someone else.
- Oh, don't be frightened.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.670
Big step!

02:51.105 --> 02:52.448
Who's next?

02:54.008 --> 02:55.817
I'm sorry. Pepper's getting
a what for your wedding?

02:55.876 --> 02:57.480
A D. P.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.991
No. No, a director of photography.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.527
Apparently, he's a big deal.
He won a Golden Globe.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.086
No, you win an Oscar. You buy a Golden Globe.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.098
So he can only meet with us
this morning.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.134
Is there any way
you could pick Lily up from school?

03:09.190 --> 03:11.636
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I can.
I'll take her to the park.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.694
That's good. it'll get my mind
off this meeting with your friend.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.604
I am so nervous.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.973
I haven't had
a sales meeting in forever.

03:18.032 --> 03:21.741
I'm a little rusty. Do you remember
when we used to call you "Little Rusty"?

03:21.802 --> 03:23.839
I was eight,
and I can still cancel this meeting.

03:23.904 --> 03:28.410
Fine. I gotta go. I gotta-
I don't know what I have to do.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.977
What is this?

03:30.044 --> 03:33.514
I'm sweating off weight
for my wrestling match. I slept in this.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.255
Does this have anything to do
with why we're out of plastic wrap?

03:36.317 --> 03:39.787
It's the bottom layer. And I've got
some news for you. it's not keeping me fresh.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.959
Okay. You're gonna be late.
You gotta get undressed in the backseat.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.730
Ooh, got any pointers for him?

03:44.792 --> 03:47.204
- Do you girls have to move that now?
- I've been lonely.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.104
Having a mirror in my room
will be like having company.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.665
Ugh, your daughter's a parakeet.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.902
- Careful.
- Stop saying that. I think I know what I'm-

03:54.969 --> 03:56.243
Oh, one second.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.214
- Oh!
- Hello?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.649
Oh, hey. No, this is a good time.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.584
- Haley!
- All right. Geez!

04:01.642 --> 04:05.021
No, I just gotta help my sister out
with something. Okay. Bye.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.616
- Okay, let's just put this down for a second.
- Okay.

04:09.450 --> 04:13.091
Uh-oh. I don't think this is gonna fit.
You'll have to get a smaller mirror.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.496
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:14.555 --> 04:16.557
Haley, you'll still be
the same size in it.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.625
No!

04:18.692 --> 04:20.365
Oh, my God! We're trapped!

04:20.427 --> 04:23.431
It's not such a huge disaster.
You'll just be a little late for school.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.999
Make up your mind! Which is it?

04:25.065 --> 04:26.305
Oh, my God.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.813
- I'm missing a text.
- Just got real, didn't it?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.439
Who sent you?

04:32.906 --> 04:34.715
Come on. We have to go.
We can't be late.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.278
- I am so excited. Aren't you?
- Oh, no.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.449
What? What's happening?
How are you ruining this?

04:39.513 --> 04:41.584
- There's a report of lice in Lily's class.
- Ugh.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.151
It's probably from Portia.

04:43.217 --> 04:44.992
You know, she is always so filthy.

04:45.052 --> 04:48.033
They had to kick her out of Swim Buddies
because she left a ring around the pool.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.831
We should probably cancel our meeting
and pick Lily up ourselves, huh?

04:51.892 --> 04:54.202
Probably? We have to!

04:54.261 --> 04:55.934
We can't risk infecting Claire...

04:55.996 --> 05:00.274
just so we can keep a meeting
with the top wedding photographer in the state.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.039
No. No.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.243
I am calling her.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.048
Yeah, it's the right thing to do...

05:08.108 --> 05:10.611
even though it's like
a one percent chance...

05:10.678 --> 05:12.487
of her actually catching anything...

05:12.546 --> 05:15.584
and a hundred percent chance
of us freaking her out.

05:15.649 --> 05:19.062
Well, now, wait.
Are we being selfish here, Cam?

05:19.119 --> 05:21.360
Maybe. Go on.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.460
If we alarm her just so that we can have
a clear conscience...

05:24.525 --> 05:26.163
doesn't that make us-

05:26.226 --> 05:27.569
- Monsters.
- Monsters.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.869
Wouldn't we be doing her a favor
by not telling her...

05:29.930 --> 05:31.603
and sparing her all that worry?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.441
Second huge favor of the day,
after you got her a meeting with your client.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.311
Mmm. I'm-
I'm starting to feel bad about this.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.147
Because we're doing so many favors,
Claire will never be able to pay us back?

05:40.207 --> 05:42.949
Thank you. Nope, she does not
need the stress, Cam.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.047
Yep. That's it.
No more favors for Claire.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.147
No!

05:46.213 --> 05:49.251
Look at us! Two blondes, having fun!

05:49.316 --> 05:50.590
Aah!

05:52.186 --> 05:53.790
Hey, buddy!

05:53.854 --> 05:56.266
My match is coming up.
Got any final dad-vice?

05:56.323 --> 05:57.563
Starting to sound natural, right?

05:57.624 --> 05:59.331
- Yeah.
- You know what?

05:59.393 --> 06:01.270
Just get out there and enjoy yourself.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.672
You showed real character
trying a new sport.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.768
No matter what happens,
I couldn't be prouder.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.710
- Thanks, Dad.
- You bet.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.076
Go get 'em!

06:09.136 --> 06:11.514
That maybe the bestpart
about being a parent.

06:11.572 --> 06:15.076
Whatever's going on in your personal life,
when your kid's happy, you're happy.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.282
A happy kid is like an antidepressant,
but a natural one...

06:18.345 --> 06:20.848
not the kind your husband has to find
in your jewelry drawer.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.417
Enough said about that!

06:27.254 --> 06:30.133
- Hey, Gil.
- Oh, whoops! I'm sorry, man.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.967
I hope I didn't blind ya. Although you
might not want to see what's next.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.667
- Our kids are wrestling each other.
- Are you kidding?

06:36.730 --> 06:40.303
Nope!
There's my little bra-snapper right there.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.903
He's a beast, man.

06:41.969 --> 06:45.041
Oh, yeah, yeah. I get it.
This is when you try to intimidate me.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.107
No. No. Hey, good luck.

06:47.174 --> 06:50.018
Hey, did you ever hear about
those illegal baby-fighting rings...

06:50.077 --> 06:51.681
they got south of the border?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.487
- That's not a real thing.
- Yeah, wife and I brought him down there.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.050
Won a whole carload of chickens.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.153
See you out there, man.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.198
- That- That never happened!
- Hey!

07:00.254 --> 07:03.235
- Watch yourself! Watch yourself!
- Wish me luck.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.237
- No need. You worked hard. I just want you to have fun.
- Thanks, Dad.

07:06.293 --> 07:09.137
Also, I'd like to revise
what I said to you in the car about biting.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.472
Manny, they have everything here.

07:14.535 --> 07:18.642
The Rain Forest Experience,
the Hurricane Booth, Discovering the Body.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.879
We have that one in Colombia too, but-
but a different kind.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.422
Oh, no.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.617
- What?
- You don't hear that?

07:28.882 --> 07:31.692
it's my new shoes. They're squeaking.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.959
Then walk softer.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.126
Oh, great.

07:36.190 --> 07:38.602
It sounds like the floor's
made of cat toys. I'm screwed.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.229
- Why?
- Why?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.240
Because these kids
make fun of everything.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.776
Hand them this,
it'll stick with me forever.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.573
That's what happened to Mumbles.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.635
Hey, Manny, come with us.

07:48.702 --> 07:52.206
- Let's go, Mumbles.
- One time!

07:52.272 --> 07:55.446
- Let's go.
- Just go on without me. I'm just gonna stand here.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.819
What, forever?

07:59.179 --> 08:00.681
What happened to him?

08:00.747 --> 08:03.853
He didn't use to be
that self-conscious before high school.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.865
He used to go around in his poncho,
play the pan flute.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.368
Ay. I miss my little old Manny.

08:11.425 --> 08:15.271
Manny, you care too much
about what other people think.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.037
I know that some of the mothers here
want to make fun of me...

08:18.098 --> 08:21.170
because of my accent
and my bouncy bosom.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.772
But they don't. You know why?
Because I don't care.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.284
Because I walk with confidence.
And so can you. Let's go.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.384
This place sucks so bad.

08:31.445 --> 08:33.686
- Sure does, Giggles.
- One time!

08:36.383 --> 08:37.953
Okay, she's not leaving.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.328
You gotta lure her away
from the staircase.

08:40.386 --> 08:42.424
She'll trust you. You're kind of dressed
like an animal trainer.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.162
Why do you keep calling it a "she"?

08:44.224 --> 08:45.965
Because "hes" don't look
at me like that.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.028
My God, is she gonna sleep all day long?

08:48.095 --> 08:50.575
That coming from you?
The possum's actually laughing.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.441
And, besides,
it's obviously not sleeping.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.447
- What else would she be doing?
- Playing.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.983
- Playing... what?
- Oh, my God!

08:59.039 --> 09:02.987
Playing possum, the one thing
that absolutely everyone knows possums do.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.616
Ha-ha! I got you! I was playing possum
on you by pretending-

09:06.680 --> 09:07.784
No, no, no, no. Don't even.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.021
No, my God.
Mom's not even here until 5:00.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.927
- And you ate our only PowerBar.
- That's probably what attracted it.

09:12.986 --> 09:16.092
- We gotta throw something at it.
- Fine.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.499
Are you crazy?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.396
Mr. Perlowe will be right with you.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.769
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:22.829 --> 09:26.470
I was so nervous before,
but I think I've really got this.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.376
- Oh, no!
- What?

09:28.435 --> 09:30.176
What's happening? How are you ruining this?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.944
Why does everybody say that?

09:32.005 --> 09:34.781
The director of photography we met with
this morning, he's turning us down.

09:34.841 --> 09:37.549
- Why?
- Um- Oh, "creative differences."

09:37.611 --> 09:40.057
He suggested one of us
wear a hidden camera in our boutonniere.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.854
He called it "Groom with a View."

09:41.915 --> 09:44.259
Somebody got it into his head
to call it the "Cam-Cam."

09:44.318 --> 09:47.356
Then there was a lot of foot-stomping
and cane-snapping and monocle-smashing.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.367
Who was your wedding photographer?
Mr. Peanut?

09:49.423 --> 09:51.994
- It's a director of-
- Sorry I'm late.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.505
Jim Perlowe,
this is my sister, Claire Dunphy.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.063
Hi. A pleasure to meet you.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.870
Listen, I went by
the construction site this morning...

09:57.931 --> 10:00.411
and those condos
are gonna be fantastic...

10:00.467 --> 10:02.811
assuming, of course,
you get the right closets and blinds.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.577
- Appears the meeting has already started, so, okay.
- Yes, it has!

10:05.639 --> 10:06.811
Bye-bye, Mitchell!

10:07.975 --> 10:09.648
Shall we?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.690
Yes, absolutely! So.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.254
Hey, sleepy!

10:16.316 --> 10:20.025
Long nap today. Claire must've really
worn you out at the park, huh?

10:20.087 --> 10:22.567
Yeah. Do you want
to lie down with me, Daddy?

10:22.623 --> 10:26.093
Oh, honey, the day I answer no
to that question...

10:27.260 --> 10:28.432
is today.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.032
- Where are you going?
- I gotta call Daddy.

10:31.098 --> 10:34.671
You should know that it's not just
our low prices that set us apart.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.772
It's our level of experience.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.783
You know, I have seen it before.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.945
A new guy walks in to
an irregular-shaped space, and he's just like...

10:42.009 --> 10:44.216
"Ugh! Where do we even start?"

10:45.278 --> 10:47.224
You start with measurements, maybe.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.191
Hey, Cam, what's up?

10:49.249 --> 10:50.990
Well, it's official. Someone has lice.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.462
- Daddy, hug me!
- Oh, oh!

10:52.519 --> 10:55.898
I would, but remember,
the carpet's hot lava! Yeah, hot lava!

10:55.956 --> 10:58.459
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

10:58.525 --> 11:00.937
I think so.
Her head sounds like Pop Rocks.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.564
You have to warn Claire.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.303
Daddy, this game is mean.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.902
Well, you know what, sweetie?
Uh-huh. Yep. Hey.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.709
All right. No. Just stay calm.

11:09.770 --> 11:13.513
Um, first of all, if there's anything
that you need from me, anything at all...

11:13.573 --> 11:15.814
I will be living at the Embassy Suites.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.220
Secondly, there's-
there's no guarantee that she has it.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.088
I mean, I'm with her right now.
I think I'd know.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.292
Yeah, I think I know.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.129
So, as you can see,
all of them are modules...

11:29.189 --> 11:30.634
so they can be customized for each unit-

11:30.691 --> 11:31.692
- Mitchell!
- Hey!

11:31.758 --> 11:33.396
- Hi!
- Claire, I need to talk to you.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.303
Yeah, right when we're done.
Just after the meeting.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.864
It's kind of important.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.570
- I love-
- Actually, I gotta take this call. Excuse me.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.273
Okay. What is going on with you?

11:42.335 --> 11:44.975
- You know how you've been scratching your head?
- Is it that noticeable?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.608
I have some kind of nervous tic.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.675
Yeah, there might be
one of those in there too.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.779
Um, so Lily brought home
lice from school.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.346
- What?
- Yeah.

11:52.412 --> 11:55.086
And I would've told you,
but Cam thought that maybe-

11:55.148 --> 11:58.994
You let me walk around with insects
gnawing on my skull, and you said nothing?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.998
- Yeah, but, Claire-
- Come here, Little Rusty.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.295
- Listen, you just-
- What kind of monster...

12:03.356 --> 12:06.064
puts their self-interest
ahead of telling another human being...

12:06.126 --> 12:09.107
that they are going to get
a parasite infestation?

12:09.162 --> 12:11.005
- I feel you would've done the same thing.
- Never.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.407
No, Claire, stop it!

12:12.466 --> 12:14.412
I got to get off to another meeting.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.311
- But, Claire, let's just cut to the chase.
- Uh-huh?

12:16.369 --> 12:18.212
- You got my business.
- Oh, super!

12:18.271 --> 12:21.809
Oh, I think we're way past handshakes, huh?

12:30.884 --> 12:33.524
Manny, stop disrespecting
your ancestors.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.568
It took them six and a half million years
to walk upright.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.398
Didn't you hear the tour guy?

12:38.458 --> 12:40.802
- "Duh."
- No, don't give me that attitude.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.205
No, I- Why is your face red?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.765
What?

12:44.831 --> 12:46.538
Ay.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.673
it must be my allergy medication.
I must be overreacting to it.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.411
Um, I'll get you some water.
There's a fountain right over there.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.013
Manny, where have you been all day?

12:57.077 --> 13:00.149
I was in the Bird Wing.
Hilarious they call it that, no?

13:00.213 --> 13:02.454
Where's your mom?

13:02.516 --> 13:05.190
- She was just there.
- I think she's hiding.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.562
She probably saw she and I
were wearing the same outfit...

13:07.621 --> 13:09.692
and didn't want
to get outdone, as usual.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.896
Uh, yeah, maybe.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.070
But the important thing
is that I have fun out there, right?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.444
Let's go over this again,
'cause I feel like you're not listening.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.210
I need you to win.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.774
- Whoa, whoa!
- Hey, Jay.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.786
Hey, Luke.
Don't let your dad get in your head.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.448
- Get out there and do your best.
- All right.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.149
What the hell was that?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.591
He's wrestling Gil Thorpe's kid.
I hate that guy.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.788
Always trying to make me
feel like less of a man.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.127
- The guy that took your necklace, right?
- My medallion!

13:40.187 --> 13:43.430
Call it what you want. I'm just glad
I don't have to help you with the clasp again.

13:44.758 --> 13:46.362
- Jay, you crying?
- No!

13:46.426 --> 13:49.600
Referee sprayed some disinfectant
on the mats. I got some in my eye.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.665
- You got a tissue?
- Here you go.

13:51.731 --> 13:54.439
Keep it. it's my wife's.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.444
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey, Son.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.006
Good to see you.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.018
- Uh, the match is about to start.
- Yeah?

14:01.074 --> 14:02.917
Which means it's about to finish.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.978
You see that little petunia
he's wrestling?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.025
Yes.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.491
You know Gil's dad?

14:09.549 --> 14:11.551
I know he always sees me at my worst.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.121
I really want this win, Phil.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.293
- I can taste it, like metal.
- Me too. Metal.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.303
I don't know what it is with this guy...

14:19.359 --> 14:21.361
but no matter what I do,
I just can't win with him.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.738
That's the way I am with his son.
And Time Warner Cable.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.538
It's emasculating, you know?

14:25.599 --> 14:27.408
It's not a feeling a man should have.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.969
You know what
the beginning of "love" is?

14:29.035 --> 14:30.571
For God's sake. We're just talking here.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.208
Why do you always have to make
everything bigger than it is?

14:33.273 --> 14:34.445
L-O.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.009
Hey, Phil, listen.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.852
Does your pharmacy carry lice shampoo?
Lily got it at school.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.257
Ooh, away, scary robot! Away!

14:42.315 --> 14:45.455
- I can't breathe.
- Good. Neither can your hair pets.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.519
- What?
- Nothing.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.657
- Lily got lice from someone.
- Portia.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.395
Who else? You know what?

14:50.457 --> 14:52.562
Skip the pharmacy.
Just borrow our lice kit.

14:52.626 --> 14:54.628
It's in the basement.
The key's under the mat.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.765
Thank you, Phil. Thanks. All right.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.709
Enough... with scary robot!

14:59.766 --> 15:02.713
- But who wants to pretend to be a
dog and ride in the car? - I do!

15:02.769 --> 15:06.307
Okay. Meet you at the door. And remember,
we're gonna keep our head outside the window.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.444
- Fun!
- Yeah, fun. Uh-huh.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.146
Fun.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.053
All right, the match is starting.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.319
I feel that metal now in my mouth,
like you were saying.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.383
- What if he loses?
- Then we hide our disappointment.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.588
Follow my lead. I've been doing it for years.

15:18.652 --> 15:21.861
The kid needs to know
we support him no matter what.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.732
Come on, Luke!

15:24.791 --> 15:26.964
Yeah!

15:46.046 --> 15:48.322
- All right, they're gone.
- Okay. Let's get out of here.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.883
Stay close.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.452
Mom, you're unbelievable.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.794
Ay. that's sweet,
but I know I look terrible.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.855
You come down on me
for being self-conscious...

15:55.922 --> 15:58.801
- then you run and hide because your face is red.
- You're right.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.860
I keep blaming the high school boys...

16:00.927 --> 16:03.373
for making you self-conscious,
and you're taking after me.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.273
We can assign blame when we're
safely behind our tinted windows.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.938
We're trapped!

16:08.001 --> 16:11.676
No. When I was in the caveman exhibit,
I discovered fire exits.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.877
I'll explain to you why
that's funny in the car. Follow me.

16:13.940 --> 16:17.046
No, Manny. it's time for me
to set a good example for you.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.987
- Okay.
- Mom, what are you doing?

16:19.045 --> 16:21.582
I'm gonna show you that it's not important
what other people think.

16:21.648 --> 16:25.221
What is important
is that you stay true to yourself. Ay.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.095
It was the bravest thing
my mom had ever done.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.598
Hey, everybody!

16:30.657 --> 16:32.933
Uh, hear my squeaky shoes?

16:32.993 --> 16:37.135
Pretty funny, isn't it?
That's right, it's me, Ol' Squeaky Shoes.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.575
- Crazy!
- Get a load of that pink shirt.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.078
Aw, it's so pretty.
Hey, Manny, nice top.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.445
- Uh, but my shoes!
- What about 'em, Pink Top?

16:47.374 --> 16:50.446
It was the bravest thing
he has ever done.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.353
They call me "Pink Top."

16:52.412 --> 16:54.892
- My hero.
- Pink Top.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.387
- Hey!
- Ho!

17:00.453 --> 17:02.956
We really blew it with Luke today.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.730
How could I do that?

17:04.790 --> 17:06.566
My dad never missed an opportunity...

17:06.626 --> 17:09.903
to let me know when I disappointed him,
and I do it to my grandkid.

17:09.963 --> 17:11.464
It's just as much my fault.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.532
I've seen what having a disapproving father
has done to my wife.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.079
- I should've known better.
- Dang it.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.742
Buddy, I know you're upset.
You've got every right.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.752
We made that wrestling match
all about our stupid feud.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.981
- That was wrong.
- Forget about those jerks.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.287
We couldn't be anything but proud of you,
just like I'm super proud of your mom.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.657
Let's repair this one first.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.663
We just don't want you
to beat yourself up because you lost.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.790
I'm not. I just started wrestling.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.858
Sure, it would've been nice to win,
but I tried my best.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.768
I just said "dang it"
because I forgot to get a straw.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.637
Son of a gun! He's actually okay.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.767
- I don't buy it.
- Why? What are you talking about?

17:45.832 --> 17:49.075
No kid lets down his father and grandfather
and is that okay with it.

17:49.135 --> 17:52.480
- He's burying his feelings.
- Or maybe he's just raised better than that.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.746
He knows it's pointless
to fight other people's battles.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.549
It's all in the D. N.A., Phil.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.555
My old man has a problem with somebody?

17:58.611 --> 18:01.251
Trust me, I'm looking
for that guy's kid on the schoolyard.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.794
- It's how men work.
- Or used to work.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.990
Maybe those thuggish Pritchett genes
got mixed with more evolved Dunphy genes...

18:07.053 --> 18:09.055
resulting in a more
elevated human being.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.124
Oh, my God! He's attacking him!

18:11.191 --> 18:14.172
- Hey! Get off my kid!
- Hey! Get off my kid!

18:14.227 --> 18:15.831
You get off of my kid!

18:15.895 --> 18:17.738
Hey, hey! Get off my daughter's husband!

18:17.797 --> 18:19.970
Would it kill you
to call me your kid, Jay?

18:21.568 --> 18:24.048
- Oh, my God. He was saving him.
- Oh.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.380
- Have a good day.
- Well, all's well that ends well.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.577
- Right.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.983
- Here we go.
- Grab a seat, Son.

18:29.042 --> 18:31.283
- Coming in.
- I think, uh, probably just a regular burger.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.414
Yeah.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.550
I can't see it anymore.
You think it's gone?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.119
It could be hiding.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.791
- I have an idea.
- What are you doing?

18:41.855 --> 18:44.563
I'm gonna create a distraction
so then we can make a break for it.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.831
Okay, just give it a second to warm up.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.065
Okay.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.472
It's back!

18:53.133 --> 18:54.635
Oh, my gosh.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.477
It's so dark down here.
Be careful, sweetie.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.054
What is going on down here?

19:13.153 --> 19:15.155
All right, I got to admit
something right here.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.223
You impressed me today, Luke.

19:17.290 --> 19:21.136
- That kid started choking. You didn't see a rival or-
- Yeah.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.572
A chance to fight
your family's stupid battles.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.110
You just saw somebody who needed help.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.840
And that makes you
the biggest man in this whole car.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.942
- You just attacked him, didn't you?
- He made that choke sign.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.008
I thought he was mocking my wrestling.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.583

and keep that to ourselves.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.974
Just wanna say I'm sorry, Doofy.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.874
- And yet you're still calling-
- What your kid did today was amazing.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.276
No hard feelings, right?

20:01.334 --> 20:05.111

for a second. Lily, honey?

20:05.171 --> 20:07.549

- All right. Good.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.109
Whoa! Who's this little dumpling?

20:09.175 --> 20:12.816
Only my niece. if there's
one thing she loves, it's piggyback.
