WEBVTT

01:59.529 --> 02:01.663
Yes?

02:03.583 --> 02:05.667
For you, my lady.

02:24.688 --> 02:27.105
How far is Mole's Town?

02:34.948 --> 02:36.448
Sansa.

02:40.370 --> 02:42.203
Lady Brienne.

02:44.825 --> 02:48.126
When I heard you had escaped
Winterfell, I feared the worst.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.380
You have no idea how happy I am

02:52.466 --> 02:54.132
to see you unharmed.

02:55.252 --> 02:57.502
Unharmed?

02:57.587 --> 02:59.304
What are you doing here?

02:59.423 --> 03:02.273
I rode north with the Knights of
the Vale to come to your aid.

03:02.392 --> 03:05.226
<i>They're encamped
at Moat Cailin as we speak.</i>

03:05.312 --> 03:07.128
To come to my aid?

03:08.765 --> 03:11.466
Did you know about Ramsay?

03:11.568 --> 03:13.801
If you didn't know, you're an idiot.

03:13.904 --> 03:16.304
If you did know, you're my enemy.

03:17.023 --> 03:19.774
Would you like to hear
about our wedding night?

03:21.945 --> 03:24.179
He never hurt my face.

03:24.281 --> 03:27.782
He needed my face,
the face of Ned Stark's daughter.

03:32.339 --> 03:34.873
But the rest of me,

03:34.958 --> 03:37.091
he did what he liked with the rest of me

03:37.177 --> 03:40.462
<i>as long as I could still give him an heir.</i>

03:43.383 --> 03:45.463
What do you think he did?

03:49.272 --> 03:51.172
I can't begin to contemplate...

03:51.274 --> 03:53.514
What do you think he did to me?

04:01.535 --> 04:04.702
Lady Sansa asked you a question.

04:04.821 --> 04:06.271
He beat you.

04:06.373 --> 04:07.655
Yes, he enjoyed that.

04:07.757 --> 04:09.257
What else do you think he did?

04:09.326 --> 04:11.493
- Sansa, I...
- What else?

04:14.164 --> 04:15.663
Did he cut you?

04:17.666 --> 04:20.502
- Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
- I didn't know.

04:20.587 --> 04:22.504
I thought you knew everyone's secrets.

04:22.589 --> 04:25.924
I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.

04:26.009 --> 04:27.642
I underestimated a stranger.

04:29.179 --> 04:30.711
The other things he did,

04:30.814 --> 04:32.597
ladies aren't supposed
to talk about those things,

04:32.682 --> 04:35.517
but I imagine brothel keepers
talk about them all the time.

04:38.021 --> 04:40.355
I can still feel it.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.575
I don't mean in my tender
heart it still pains me so.

04:43.693 --> 04:47.529
I can still feel what he did in
my body standing here right now.

04:50.033 --> 04:53.084
I'm so sorry.

04:53.203 --> 04:55.086
You said you would protect me.

04:55.205 --> 04:58.739
And I will. You must believe me
when I tell you that I will.

04:58.842 --> 05:02.293
I don't believe you anymore.
I don't need you anymore.

05:02.379 --> 05:04.212
You can't protect me.

05:04.297 --> 05:06.180
You won't even be able
to protect yourself

05:06.266 --> 05:08.550
if I tell Brienne
to cut you down.

05:11.104 --> 05:12.520
And why shouldn't I?

05:15.442 --> 05:17.692
Do you want me
to beg for my life?

05:17.777 --> 05:20.111
If that's what you want, I will.

05:22.148 --> 05:24.616
Whatever you ask
that is in my power,

05:24.734 --> 05:25.933
I will do.

05:26.036 --> 05:29.871
What if I want you
to die here and now?

05:31.625 --> 05:33.608
Then I will die.

05:35.412 --> 05:38.946
You freed me from the monsters
who murdered my family

05:39.049 --> 05:43.084
and you gave me to other
monsters who murdered my family.

05:44.754 --> 05:46.804
<i>Go back to Moat Cailin.</i>

05:46.923 --> 05:49.307
My brother and I will take
back the North on our own.

05:49.426 --> 05:50.958
I never want to see you again.

05:51.061 --> 05:54.262
I would do anything to undo
what's been done to you.

05:57.267 --> 05:58.933
I know that I can't.

06:00.987 --> 06:03.738
Will you allow me to say
one more thing before I go?

06:06.776 --> 06:09.911
<i>Your great-uncle
Brynden the Blackfish</i>

06:09.996 --> 06:13.665
has gathered what remains of the
Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.

06:13.783 --> 06:15.917
You might consider seeking him out.

06:16.002 --> 06:19.320
The time may come when you
need an army loyal to you.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.422
I have an army.

06:20.457 --> 06:22.457
Your brother's army.

06:30.967 --> 06:32.016
Half-brother.

07:01.715 --> 07:02.997
You're not ready.

07:05.335 --> 07:08.219
You should go home before it's too late.

08:04.561 --> 08:08.196
You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.

08:23.296 --> 08:25.079
She has a point.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.554
None of the first Faceless Men
were born to lords and ladies.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.625
They began as slaves
in the mines of Valyria.

08:37.727 --> 08:39.260
Who was the first?

08:39.345 --> 08:40.761
He was no one.

08:42.097 --> 08:45.099
The Many-Faced God taught
him how to shed his face

08:45.185 --> 08:46.818
and how to give the gift.

08:46.936 --> 08:50.354
The man taught others in
exchange for their service.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.908
Many served, many more
gifts were given.

08:53.993 --> 08:56.861
Soon all the masters
and overseers were gone

08:56.946 --> 08:59.163
and the Faceless Men fled.

08:59.282 --> 09:01.082
Where did they go?

09:01.167 --> 09:02.784
Here.

09:02.869 --> 09:06.170
They founded the Free City of
Braavos and built this house.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.508
These were the faces
they wore in life

09:10.610 --> 09:13.160
when they were not
wearing others.

09:13.263 --> 09:16.013
The first Faceless Men.

09:17.550 --> 09:19.350
And now a girl is one of them,

09:19.469 --> 09:21.636
if a girl desires.

09:23.106 --> 09:25.306
A girl has no desires.

09:32.565 --> 09:34.148
Who?

09:41.624 --> 09:44.358
<i>An actress who calls
herself Lady Crane.</i>

09:44.460 --> 09:47.328
She performs at the theater
in Sheelba Square.

09:49.132 --> 09:52.049
<i>A girl has been given
a second chance.</i>

09:52.168 --> 09:54.368
There will not be a third.

09:54.470 --> 09:56.554
One way or another,

09:56.656 --> 09:59.674
a face will be
added to the hall.

10:18.578 --> 10:21.279
Ahh!

10:23.199 --> 10:25.950
Oh, murdered by a boar.

10:26.035 --> 10:28.619
The great big hairy whore.

10:28.705 --> 10:32.290
He dug in his tusks
and dug out my guts

10:32.375 --> 10:35.843
and soon I am no more.

10:35.929 --> 10:38.846
Oh, come, Father,
in bed you must lie.

10:38.932 --> 10:41.849
I love you, Father.
Please don't die.

10:41.935 --> 10:45.603
Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.

10:45.722 --> 10:49.440
I feel the winds of winter
as they lick across the land.

10:49.559 --> 10:52.944
And our son alone
on that cold, cold throne

10:53.062 --> 10:55.196
without a guiding hand.

10:55.281 --> 10:58.566
Who will teach him strength?
Who will teach him grace?

10:58.651 --> 11:02.570
To whom will he turn when it's time to
learn to look darkness in the face?

11:02.655 --> 11:06.240
Ned Stark will do fine.
Now bring me more wine.

11:08.795 --> 11:10.628
Ooh!

11:10.747 --> 11:13.297
Ooh, what's happened here, then?

11:13.416 --> 11:15.249
He brought you here, Ned Stark,

11:15.335 --> 11:17.752
'cause you're the brightest
fellow in the land.

11:17.837 --> 11:19.420
You should be king of us all

11:19.505 --> 11:21.722
and I should be your Hand.

11:21.808 --> 11:24.058
We men of the North
are right good hands

11:24.143 --> 11:25.960
at keeping people lawful.

11:26.062 --> 11:27.695
I'd ask him for permission,

11:27.764 --> 11:29.964
but he smells too bloody awful.

11:31.768 --> 11:35.019
<i>I die! I die!</i>

11:35.104 --> 11:38.305
And here I now must lie.

11:38.408 --> 11:41.993
Oh, woe.
Oh, no.

11:43.746 --> 11:47.982
Oh, I am about to go.

11:50.119 --> 11:52.086
Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?

11:52.171 --> 11:54.121
The Iron Throne's what I demand.

11:54.207 --> 11:55.122
- You cannot.
- I can.

11:55.208 --> 11:56.123
- You will not.
- I will.

11:56.209 --> 11:57.875
- You dare not.
- I dare yes.

11:57.961 --> 12:00.094
<i>- The line of succession.
- What's that mean?</i>

12:00.179 --> 12:01.963
<i>- The proper progression.
- What's that mean?</i>

12:02.048 --> 12:04.498
- The lawful ascension.
- What's that mean?

12:16.446 --> 12:19.697
So move along, give me my chair

12:19.816 --> 12:21.899
and there won't be no more trouble.

12:25.204 --> 12:28.022
But we had a deal
all done and dusted.

12:28.124 --> 12:31.325
I'm starting to think
you can't be trusted.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.671
Save my father.

12:43.756 --> 12:47.276
Truly you should.
Killing the man will do you no good.

12:47.310 --> 12:49.560
- Save him, please.
- Show him mercy.

12:49.679 --> 12:52.179
<i>Show the people what
a good king should be.</i>

12:52.265 --> 12:54.515
Good people, you may all relax.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.734
My father's friend
shall be spared the...

12:59.072 --> 13:02.239
<i>Father! No!</i>

13:02.358 --> 13:05.026
Oh, Father.
Oh!

13:14.287 --> 13:15.736
<i>Worry not!</i>

13:15.838 --> 13:17.338
<i>All is well.</i>

13:17.423 --> 13:19.340
I have here a decree

13:19.425 --> 13:22.209
from my father Tywin Lannister,

13:22.295 --> 13:24.411
the richest man you'll see.

13:24.514 --> 13:27.048
He proclaims me
Hand of the King.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.933
The position's mine for life.

13:29.052 --> 13:31.418
And he's given me permission to take

13:31.521 --> 13:33.637
Sansa as my wife.

13:36.442 --> 13:38.476
You'll learn that what I lack in height,

13:38.561 --> 13:40.811
I make up for in appetite.

13:40.897 --> 13:43.280
<i>So let's forget about your plight,</i>

13:43.399 --> 13:45.483
and go rehearse our wedding night.

13:54.911 --> 13:57.711
It's a wart.
Two warts.

13:57.797 --> 13:59.630
I've got two fucking
warts on my cock.

13:59.749 --> 14:03.584
Well, don't worry, love. They usually
go away in five or six years.

14:03.669 --> 14:06.954
Oh, wash this, darling.
It stinks of me.

14:07.056 --> 14:10.290
You can do better, Bianca, dear.
You must do.

14:10.393 --> 14:12.059
I had two lines.

14:12.145 --> 14:14.361
There are no small parts.
You rang very false.

14:14.430 --> 14:16.013
I rang very false?

14:16.099 --> 14:19.016
What you need, love,
is for someone to ring you true.

14:20.937 --> 14:23.487
You weren't complaining
about me last night.

14:23.606 --> 14:25.566
<i>May I get you some wine,
Lady Crane?</i>

14:25.608 --> 14:27.691
<i>I'm a rum girl, Bobono.</i>

14:27.777 --> 14:30.027
You need to know that if
we're going to be intimate.

14:30.113 --> 14:31.695
Of course we're going to be intimate.

14:31.781 --> 14:34.365
It's only a matter of time.

14:37.086 --> 14:39.086
To our children.

14:39.172 --> 14:41.172
May they have your talent.

14:41.290 --> 14:43.174
And your filthy mind.

14:49.882 --> 14:52.299
A girl will poison the rum.

14:52.385 --> 14:54.635
Lady Crane is the only
one who drinks it.

14:58.641 --> 15:01.725
If a girl could use one of
the faces from the hall...

15:01.811 --> 15:03.978
A girl is not ready.

15:06.449 --> 15:08.949
She's a good actress.

15:09.035 --> 15:11.368
So a man has heard.

15:11.487 --> 15:14.321
Seems like a decent woman.

15:17.326 --> 15:20.744
Does death only come for the wicked
and leave the decent behind?

15:22.882 --> 15:24.381
No.

15:28.137 --> 15:29.703
Who wants her dead?

15:29.805 --> 15:32.590
That does not matter.
The price was paid.

15:34.393 --> 15:37.377
The younger actress.

15:37.480 --> 15:40.814
She's jealous because
Lady Crane is better.

15:40.900 --> 15:44.500
A girl must decide if she wants
to serve the Many-Faced God.

15:45.855 --> 15:47.571
A girl has decided.

15:47.690 --> 15:51.325
A servant does not ask questions.

17:00.846 --> 17:03.264
No! No! No!

17:26.355 --> 17:28.656
It was you.

17:28.758 --> 17:30.457
You made the white walkers.

17:30.543 --> 17:32.676
We were at war.

17:32.778 --> 17:35.179
<i>We were being slaughtered.</i>

17:35.281 --> 17:37.715
<i>Our sacred trees cut down.</i>

17:37.800 --> 17:40.534
We needed to defend ourselves.

17:40.636 --> 17:42.136
From whom?

17:42.221 --> 17:44.772
From you.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.057
From men.

17:55.701 --> 17:59.403
We speak in the presence
of the Drowned God.

17:59.488 --> 18:01.572
In his name we gather today

18:01.657 --> 18:05.292
to choose a new king as our leader.

18:05.378 --> 18:07.244
Who makes a claim?

18:12.168 --> 18:14.418
I am Yara Greyjoy,

18:14.503 --> 18:16.920
daughter of Balon Greyjoy,

18:17.006 --> 18:19.256
King of the Iron Islands.

18:20.593 --> 18:22.542
I claim the Salt Throne.

18:22.645 --> 18:25.212
We've never had a queen.
Not once.

18:25.314 --> 18:27.731
There are many things we've never done.

18:27.850 --> 18:30.567
We've never made our mark
upon the world.

18:30.686 --> 18:34.104
The great lords of
Westeros pay us no mind

18:34.190 --> 18:37.241
until our little raids
buzz through their kingdoms

18:37.360 --> 18:38.992
<i>long enough to become a nuisance.</i>

18:39.078 --> 18:41.362
Then they swat us down.

18:41.447 --> 18:44.948
They conquer us, humiliate us,

18:45.034 --> 18:47.501
<i>and go right back to forgetting we exist.</i>

18:47.586 --> 18:49.503
Aye!

18:49.588 --> 18:51.922
- We are a sea people.
- Aye!

18:52.041 --> 18:55.292
- Our god is a sea god.
- Aye!

18:55.378 --> 18:57.544
When I am queen, we will
build a fleet that...

18:57.630 --> 18:59.346
- You shall not be queen!
- I am not finished!

18:59.432 --> 19:02.015
Yes, you are!
A woman will not lead us.

19:02.101 --> 19:05.436
Not when Balon's
own male heir has returned.

19:32.465 --> 19:34.498
I am Theon Greyjoy...

19:35.968 --> 19:38.886
last living son
of Balon Greyjoy.

19:46.929 --> 19:49.513
And she is your rightful ruler.

19:49.598 --> 19:50.848
Aye!

19:50.933 --> 19:52.566
Those of you that have sailed under her,

19:52.651 --> 19:54.568
and there are many of you here,

19:54.653 --> 19:57.271
- <i>you know what she is.</i>
- Aye!

19:57.356 --> 19:58.655
- She is a reaver.
- Aye!

19:58.774 --> 20:00.991
- She is a warrior.
- Aye!

20:01.110 --> 20:02.860
She is Ironborn!

20:02.945 --> 20:04.578
Aye!

20:04.663 --> 20:07.247
We will find no better leader.

20:10.286 --> 20:12.119
This is our queen.

20:17.376 --> 20:21.328
<i>Yara! Yara! Yara!</i>

20:21.430 --> 20:24.014
I'm Euron Greyjoy.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.550
I claim the Salt Throne.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.196
Niece.

20:40.783 --> 20:41.783
Nephew.

20:43.652 --> 20:45.452
Little Theon.

20:47.122 --> 20:50.040
Heard you managed to fuck
things right into the ground.

20:51.660 --> 20:53.544
<i>Captured a castle you couldn't keep.</i>

20:53.662 --> 20:56.663
Got yourself taken prisoner.

20:56.749 --> 20:58.966
Even heard you have no cock.

21:02.888 --> 21:05.222
Explains why you think
a woman can be king.

21:05.341 --> 21:07.090
When did you return, Uncle?

21:07.176 --> 21:09.393
A few days ago.

21:09.512 --> 21:11.878
I had some things
to take care of.

21:11.981 --> 21:13.730
Long overdue.

21:15.017 --> 21:16.600
I'm glad you're here.

21:18.687 --> 21:22.356
Now I know what my first
act as queen will be.

21:22.441 --> 21:25.275
To execute the man
who killed my father.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.200
I did.

21:33.285 --> 21:35.419
I killed him.

21:36.872 --> 21:39.506
Threw him right over a rope bridge

21:39.592 --> 21:42.759
and watched him fall.

21:42.878 --> 21:44.545
<i>He was leading us nowhere</i>

21:44.630 --> 21:47.264
and we would still be heading
there if it weren't for me.

21:47.383 --> 21:50.434
<i>No one loved him.
No one wanted to follow him.</i>

21:50.553 --> 21:53.270
He led us into two wars
we couldn't win.

21:53.389 --> 21:57.357
I apologize to you all for
not killing him years ago.

21:57.443 --> 21:59.643
That would have been hard to do.

21:59.728 --> 22:01.728
You weren't here.

22:01.814 --> 22:05.399
Last I heard, you were gallivanting
around the world having a grand old time.

22:05.484 --> 22:06.950
Gallivanting?

22:07.069 --> 22:08.768
That the sort of thing
you start to say

22:08.871 --> 22:11.288
once your dick gets chopped off?

22:11.407 --> 22:14.241
<i>Did the great lords of Westeros
teach you words like that?</i>

22:15.578 --> 22:17.411
You were gone.

22:17.496 --> 22:18.996
Yara was here.

22:19.081 --> 22:21.798
<i>Being Ironborn.
Leading Ironborn.</i>

22:21.917 --> 22:24.801
<i>Getting ready to bring us
back to glory.</i>

22:24.920 --> 22:26.386
<i>And how will she do that?</i>

22:26.472 --> 22:30.841
I will build the largest fleet
the world has ever seen.

22:33.062 --> 22:37.264
Right idea, except I'm the one who's
going to build the Iron Fleet

22:37.349 --> 22:39.650
<i>because I'm the one
who knows how to use it.</i>

22:39.768 --> 22:41.234
<i>I've been all over the world.</i>

22:41.320 --> 22:44.655
I've seen more of it
than all of you combined.

22:44.773 --> 22:47.691
And across the sea there is a person

22:47.776 --> 22:51.645
who hates the great lords of
Westeros just as much as we do.

22:51.747 --> 22:54.331
Someone with a large army,

22:54.450 --> 22:58.201
three large dragons, and no husband.

22:58.287 --> 23:00.537
<i>I'm going to build that fleet</i>

23:00.623 --> 23:02.839
and I'm going to gallivant right over

23:02.958 --> 23:05.092
and give it to Daenerys Targaryen

23:05.177 --> 23:07.594
along with my big cock.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.680
You're going to seduce
the Dragon Queen?

23:09.798 --> 23:13.016
I'm not going to seduce her.
The Iron Fleet will seduce her.

23:13.135 --> 23:15.936
And together we're going
to take the Seven Kingdoms.

23:16.021 --> 23:19.389
I wasn't born to be King.

23:19.475 --> 23:22.008
I paid the iron price

23:22.111 --> 23:23.560
and here I stand.

23:25.397 --> 23:29.116
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

23:29.201 --> 23:33.153
Euron! Euron!
Euron! Euron!

23:33.238 --> 23:35.405
Euron! Euron!

23:46.502 --> 23:49.336
May Euron, your servant,
be born again

23:49.421 --> 23:51.972
from the sea as you were.

23:52.057 --> 23:55.142
<i>Bless him with salt.
Bless him with stone.</i>

23:55.227 --> 23:57.144
<i>Bless him with steel.</i>

23:57.229 --> 23:59.879
<i>Listen to the waves.
Listen to the god.</i>

23:59.982 --> 24:03.100
<i>He is speaking to us and he says</i>

24:03.185 --> 24:08.238
<i>we shall have no king
but Euron Greyjoy.</i>

24:08.357 --> 24:11.558
Let the sea wash your follies
and your vanities away.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.910
<i>Let the old Euron drown.</i>

24:14.029 --> 24:16.830
<i>Let his lungs fill with seawater.</i>

24:22.538 --> 24:25.789
<i>Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.</i>

24:25.874 --> 24:28.458
<i>What is dead may never die,</i>

24:28.544 --> 24:32.212
but rises again
harder and stronger.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.531
What is dead may never die.

25:41.617 --> 25:44.868
What is dead may never die.

25:58.801 --> 26:01.268
Where are my niece and nephew?

26:06.225 --> 26:08.358
Let's go murder them.

26:28.413 --> 26:30.630
<i>They stole our best ships.</i>

26:31.967 --> 26:33.917
Won't be enough to save them.

26:35.721 --> 26:37.871
Go back to your homes.

26:37.973 --> 26:40.340
Chop down every tree you can find.

26:40.425 --> 26:43.009
Quarter-saw the timber
and start building.

26:43.095 --> 26:45.178
I want every man bending planks.

26:45.264 --> 26:48.765
I want every woman
spinning flax for sails.

26:48.851 --> 26:51.184
Build me a thousand ships

26:51.270 --> 26:53.737
and I will give you this world.

27:12.875 --> 27:15.675
I banished you twice.

27:17.045 --> 27:19.930
You came back twice.

27:23.268 --> 27:25.185
And you saved my life.

27:29.808 --> 27:31.808
So I can't take you back

27:31.894 --> 27:34.027
and I can't send you away.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.812
You must send me away.

27:51.546 --> 27:53.279
Is there a cure?

27:53.382 --> 27:55.665
I don't know.

27:56.668 --> 27:58.635
How long does it take?

27:58.754 --> 28:01.254
I don't know that either.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.820
But I've seen what happens
when it goes far enough.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.300
I'll end things before that.

28:10.432 --> 28:12.565
I'm sorry.

28:13.602 --> 28:14.818
I'm so sorry.

28:14.937 --> 28:17.136
Don't be.

28:17.239 --> 28:19.689
All I've ever wanted
was to serve you.

28:22.861 --> 28:25.445
Tyrion Lannister was right.

28:28.116 --> 28:30.667
I love you.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.290
I'll always love you.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.880
Good-bye, khaleesi.

28:49.221 --> 28:51.554
Do not walk away
from your queen,

28:51.640 --> 28:53.723
Jorah the Andal.

28:55.811 --> 28:58.144
You have not been dismissed.

28:59.481 --> 29:01.865
You pledged yourself to me.

29:01.984 --> 29:05.285
You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

29:07.322 --> 29:10.907
<i>Well, I command you to find the cure</i>

29:10.993 --> 29:13.543
<i>wherever it is in this world.</i>

29:15.964 --> 29:18.631
I command you to heal yourself

29:18.717 --> 29:21.584
<i>and then return to me.</i>

29:24.673 --> 29:27.424
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

29:27.509 --> 29:30.010
I need you by my side.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.385
In the last fortnight since
our pact with the Masters,

30:12.471 --> 30:15.772
how many killings have been carried
out by the Sons of the Harpy?

30:15.891 --> 30:17.440
None.

30:17.559 --> 30:20.479
And how many Masters have been
butchered by the free men?

30:20.562 --> 30:23.146
Two, but that was the day of the pact.

30:23.231 --> 30:24.981
<i>Since then, nothing.</i>

30:25.067 --> 30:28.101
So it's safe to say that a
fragile peace has taken hold.

30:28.203 --> 30:29.569
For now.

30:29.654 --> 30:31.571
For now is the best we
get in our profession.

30:31.656 --> 30:33.156
It's not enough.

30:33.241 --> 30:35.075
Considering the city was
on the brink of civil war,

30:35.160 --> 30:36.720
I'd say it's a good start.

30:36.745 --> 30:39.329
It's not enough
for Meereen to have peace.

30:39.414 --> 30:41.898
They need to know Daenerys
is responsible for it.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.784
The Sons of the Harpy
have a good story.

30:44.886 --> 30:47.053
Resist the foreign invaders.

30:47.139 --> 30:49.255
Our queen has an even better story.

30:49.341 --> 30:54.010
Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains and all that.

30:54.096 --> 30:56.479
The people know
who brought them freedom.

30:56.598 --> 30:59.065
Yes, but do they know
who brought them security?

30:59.151 --> 31:01.184
Who brought about
an end to the violence?

31:01.303 --> 31:03.903
We need someone
the people trust,

31:03.989 --> 31:07.407
someone they know cannot
be bought or influenced.

31:07.492 --> 31:10.643
Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

31:10.745 --> 31:12.996
Who said anything about "Him"?

31:15.083 --> 31:17.502
You stand in the presence of Kinvara,

31:18.461 --> 31:21.422
High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis,

31:21.923 --> 31:23.132
the Flame of Truth,

31:23.216 --> 31:24.592
the Light of Wisdom,

31:24.926 --> 31:28.471
the First Servant of the Lord of Light.

31:34.727 --> 31:38.147
Welcome to Meereen.

31:39.724 --> 31:42.692
That's about the extent
of my Valyrian.

31:48.483 --> 31:51.284
Thank you for travelling
all this way.

31:51.369 --> 31:55.205
I know from personal experience how
uncomfortable the journey can be.

31:59.828 --> 32:02.962
The truth is we need your help.

32:03.048 --> 32:06.166
We had hoped that we could
somehow persuade you to...

32:06.251 --> 32:08.532
You don't need to persuade me.

32:08.587 --> 32:10.386
I came to help.

32:10.505 --> 32:13.673
Daenerys Stormborn is the
one who was promised.

32:13.758 --> 32:17.644
From the fire she was
reborn to remake the world.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.729
Yes.

32:19.848 --> 32:21.714
She has freed the slaves from their chains

32:21.816 --> 32:25.351
and crucified the Masters for their sins.

32:25.437 --> 32:27.220
She did indeed.

32:27.322 --> 32:30.190
Her dragons are fire made flesh,

32:30.275 --> 32:32.108
a gift from the Lord of Light.

32:32.194 --> 32:35.111
But you heard all of this before,
haven't you?

32:35.197 --> 32:37.580
On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

32:39.868 --> 32:43.253
<i>The dragons will purify
nonbelievers by the thousands,</i>

32:43.371 --> 32:45.738
burning their sins and flesh away.

32:45.840 --> 32:50.543
Ideally we'd avoid purifying
too many nonbelievers.

32:50.629 --> 32:53.630
The Mother of Dragons has followers
of many different faiths.

32:53.715 --> 32:56.916
You want your queen to be
worshipped and obeyed.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.802
And while she's gone,
you want her advisors

32:59.888 --> 33:01.587
to be worshipped and obeyed.

33:01.690 --> 33:04.924
I'd settle for obeyed.

33:05.026 --> 33:08.027
<i>I will summon my most eloquent priests.</i>

33:08.113 --> 33:10.730
They will spread the word.

33:10.815 --> 33:14.433
Daenerys has been sent to lead
the people against the darkness

33:14.536 --> 33:18.621
in this war and in the
great war still to come.

33:18.740 --> 33:20.206
That sounds most excellent.

33:20.292 --> 33:23.276
A man named Stannis
Baratheon was anointed

33:23.378 --> 33:26.129
as the chosen one
by one of your priestesses.

33:26.248 --> 33:29.082
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

33:29.167 --> 33:32.335
He attacked King's Landing
and was soundly defeated

33:32.420 --> 33:34.554
by the man standing beside me.

33:34.639 --> 33:37.106
Last I had heard,
he had been defeated again,

33:37.225 --> 33:41.394
this time at Winterfell
and this time for good.

33:41.479 --> 33:44.597
We'd be most grateful for any support
you could provide the queen.

33:44.683 --> 33:47.800
I suppose it's hard for a
fanatic to admit a mistake.

33:47.902 --> 33:51.437
Isn't that the whole point
of being a fanatic?

33:51.523 --> 33:53.690
You're always right.

33:53.775 --> 33:56.409
Everything is the Lord's will.

33:56.494 --> 34:00.163
Everything is the Lord's will.

34:00.282 --> 34:03.032
But men and women make mistakes.

34:03.118 --> 34:05.084
Even honest servants of the Lord.

34:05.170 --> 34:09.121
And you,
an honest servant of the Lord,

34:09.206 --> 34:11.708
why should I trust you
to know any more

34:11.793 --> 34:13.713
than the priestess
who counseled Stannis?

34:13.795 --> 34:16.763
My friend has a healthy
skepticism of religion,

34:16.848 --> 34:19.599
but we are all loyal
supporters of the queen.

34:24.773 --> 34:26.693
Everyone is what they are

34:26.808 --> 34:30.509
and where they are for a reason.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.780
Terrible things happen for a reason.

34:33.864 --> 34:37.533
Take what happened to you,
Lord Varys, when you were a child.

34:39.237 --> 34:40.987
<i>If not for your mutilation</i>

34:41.072 --> 34:42.989
<i>at the hand of
a second-rate sorcerer,</i>

34:43.074 --> 34:46.326
<i>you wouldn't be here
helping the Lord's Chosen</i>

34:46.411 --> 34:49.527
<i>bring his light into the world.</i>

34:49.630 --> 34:52.864
Knowledge has made you powerful.

34:52.967 --> 34:56.052
But there's still
so much you don't know.

34:58.173 --> 35:01.174
<i>Do you remember
what you heard that night</i>

35:01.259 --> 35:04.811
<i>when the sorcerer tossed
your parts in the fire?</i>

35:06.898 --> 35:10.516
You heard a voice call out from the flames.
Do you remember?

35:13.021 --> 35:16.823
Should I tell you what the voice said?

35:16.908 --> 35:20.493
Should I tell you the name
of the one who spoke?

35:30.121 --> 35:32.288
We serve the same queen.

35:32.374 --> 35:34.424
If you are her true friend,

35:34.542 --> 35:37.176
you have nothing to fear from me.

37:27.121 --> 37:28.654
What?

39:12.427 --> 39:14.410
He saw me, the Night King!

39:14.512 --> 39:16.679
- <i>He saw me!</i>
- He touched you.

39:18.232 --> 39:20.349
I don't know.
He was close, but...

39:20.435 --> 39:21.435
He touched you.

39:24.772 --> 39:26.805
He knows you are here.
He'll come for you.

39:26.908 --> 39:28.291
But he can't get in.

39:28.409 --> 39:31.944
He can now.
His mark is on you.

39:32.030 --> 39:34.110
You must leave, all of you.

39:38.036 --> 39:39.985
<i>Come on, Hodor.
Help me with the sledge.</i>

39:40.071 --> 39:41.871
Hodor.

39:41.956 --> 39:43.940
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

39:44.042 --> 39:46.943
- The time has come.
- The time for what?

39:47.045 --> 39:50.096
For you to become me.

39:50.181 --> 39:54.283
But am I ready?

39:54.385 --> 39:56.302
No.

39:58.222 --> 40:00.973
We can't defend the north
from the walkers

40:01.059 --> 40:02.808
and the south from the Boltons.

40:02.894 --> 40:04.843
If we want to survive,
we need Winterfell

40:04.946 --> 40:07.730
and to take Winterfell,
we need more men.

40:10.952 --> 40:13.619
<i>Aside from the Starks
and the Boltons,</i>

40:13.705 --> 40:16.405
the most powerful
houses in the North

40:16.491 --> 40:18.541
are the Umbers, the Karstarks,

40:18.660 --> 40:20.292
and the Manderlys.

40:20.378 --> 40:23.079
The Umbers and the Karstarks

40:23.164 --> 40:25.131
have already declared
for the Boltons,

40:25.216 --> 40:26.849
so we're not doing
so well there.

40:26.968 --> 40:29.585
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

40:29.671 --> 40:31.921
But the Karstarks
declared for Ramsay

40:32.006 --> 40:34.540
without knowing
they had another choice.

40:34.642 --> 40:36.976
I beg your pardon, my lady,

40:37.061 --> 40:40.212
but they know that a Stark
beheaded their father.

40:40.314 --> 40:42.674
I don't think we can
count on them either.

40:44.018 --> 40:46.702
How well do you know
the North, Ser Davos?

40:46.821 --> 40:48.187
Precious little, my lady.

40:48.272 --> 40:50.406
<i>My father always said
Northerners are different.</i>

40:50.525 --> 40:54.226
More loyal,
more suspicious of outsiders.

40:54.328 --> 40:55.894
They may well be loyal,

40:55.997 --> 40:57.947
but how many rose up
against the Boltons

40:58.032 --> 41:00.112
when they betrayed your family?

41:02.170 --> 41:04.754
I may not know the North,
but I know men.

41:04.872 --> 41:07.373
They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world

41:07.458 --> 41:10.376
and even the bravest of
them don't want to see

41:10.461 --> 41:13.779
their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.

41:13.881 --> 41:17.216
If Jon's going to convince
them to fight alongside him,

41:17.301 --> 41:19.268
they need to believe
it's a fight they can win.

41:19.387 --> 41:21.937
There are more than three
other houses in the North...

41:22.056 --> 41:24.690
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,

41:24.776 --> 41:26.392
<i>Mazin, Hornwood.</i>

41:26.477 --> 41:30.095
Two dozen more.
Together they equal all the others.

41:30.198 --> 41:32.148
We can start small and build.

41:32.233 --> 41:34.700
<i>The North remembers.</i>

41:34.786 --> 41:36.268
<i>They remember the Stark name.</i>

41:36.354 --> 41:38.270
People will still risk
everything for it,

41:38.372 --> 41:40.573
from White Harbor
to Ramsay's own door.

41:40.658 --> 41:42.875
I don't doubt it.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.077
But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

41:45.163 --> 41:47.246
No, but I do.

41:50.134 --> 41:52.785
Jon is every bit
as much Ned Stark's son

41:52.887 --> 41:54.670
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

41:54.756 --> 41:56.806
<i>And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,</i>

41:56.924 --> 41:59.892
<i>but they will back us against
the Boltons without question.</i>

41:59.977 --> 42:01.510
I didn't know the Tullys
still had an army.

42:01.596 --> 42:03.562
My uncle the Blackfish
has reformed it

42:03.648 --> 42:04.897
and retaken Riverrun.

42:04.982 --> 42:07.066
How do you know that?

42:08.436 --> 42:11.437
Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

42:13.441 --> 42:15.191
That's good.

42:15.276 --> 42:17.309
The Blackfish is a legend.

42:17.411 --> 42:19.812
His support would mean a great deal.

42:19.914 --> 42:22.915
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.360
almost starts to look like a winning side.

42:27.622 --> 42:29.705
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

42:29.791 --> 42:31.590
You heard them.
We need more men

42:31.676 --> 42:33.492
and my uncle has an army.

42:33.594 --> 42:35.127
We can send the Blackfish a raven.

42:35.213 --> 42:37.263
Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.

42:37.348 --> 42:39.014
It has to be you.

42:39.133 --> 42:41.414
Ride for Riverrun.
My uncle will talk to you

42:41.469 --> 42:43.869
and you'll know how to talk to him.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.056
What is it?

42:48.860 --> 42:50.910
I don't like leaving you here alone.

42:51.012 --> 42:52.294
With Jon?

42:52.396 --> 42:55.180
Not him.
He seems trustworthy.

42:55.283 --> 42:57.283
A bit brooding, perhaps.

42:57.368 --> 42:59.451
I suppose that's
understandable, considering.

43:01.155 --> 43:03.038
The others, though.

43:05.209 --> 43:08.861
Davos and the Red Woman helped
a man murder his own brother

43:08.963 --> 43:10.563
with bloodmagic.

43:10.665 --> 43:13.249
<i>And when Stannis paid for his crime,
where were they?</i>

43:13.351 --> 43:17.553
Already out looking for a
leader with better prospects.

43:17.672 --> 43:20.089
And that wildling fellow
with the beard...

43:20.174 --> 43:23.494
Jon isn't Tormund.
Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman

43:23.544 --> 43:26.545
or Stannis for that matter.
Jon is Jon.

43:26.647 --> 43:30.099
He's my brother. He'll keep me safe.
I trust him.

43:32.587 --> 43:36.505
Then why did you lie to him when he asked
you how you learned about Riverrun?

43:45.700 --> 43:47.399
New dress?

43:47.501 --> 43:50.235
I made it myself.
Do you like it?

43:50.338 --> 43:54.340
Yeah, it's...
I like the wolf bit.

43:54.425 --> 43:58.544
Good, because I made this for you.

44:01.215 --> 44:03.549
<i>I made it like the one
Father used to wear.</i>

44:03.634 --> 44:06.552
As near as I can remember.

44:08.306 --> 44:10.022
Thank you, Sansa.

44:10.107 --> 44:11.774
You're welcome.

44:31.996 --> 44:34.446
Don't knock it down while I'm gone.

44:34.548 --> 44:36.465
I'll do my best.

44:41.889 --> 44:44.006
Good luck.

45:15.122 --> 45:17.673
Should we close the gate,
Lord Commander?

45:17.792 --> 45:19.875
I'm not the Lord Comman...

45:24.348 --> 45:28.600
Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.

45:40.564 --> 45:42.347
<i>We can go home now, Hodor.</i>

45:42.450 --> 45:45.017
Well, maybe not home home,

45:45.119 --> 45:47.319
but somewhere that isn't a cave.

45:47.421 --> 45:48.821
Hodor.

45:48.906 --> 45:50.956
Eat something that isn't moss.

45:53.160 --> 45:55.494
I want an egg.
How do you like 'em?

45:55.579 --> 45:58.530
Boiled? Fried up with some butter?

45:58.632 --> 46:00.215
Hodor.

46:00.334 --> 46:03.886
With a rasher of bacon
and some blood sausage.

46:04.005 --> 46:05.304
Hodor.

47:05.232 --> 47:07.449
Get Bran and run!

47:19.747 --> 47:21.713
Bran.
Bran, wake up.

47:21.799 --> 47:24.833
- Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

47:24.919 --> 47:26.468
Bran, wake up.

47:36.564 --> 47:39.131
<i>- Gods keep you on the kingsroad.
- Take it easy.</i>

47:39.233 --> 47:40.349
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

47:43.604 --> 47:44.803
Hodor.

47:44.905 --> 47:46.855
Hodor. Hodor.

47:48.359 --> 47:49.441
Help me!

48:08.879 --> 48:10.359
<i>Go!</i>

48:11.132 --> 48:12.631
Go!

48:59.847 --> 49:02.097
<i>Remember that you are a Stark.</i>

49:02.183 --> 49:04.566
Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale

49:04.685 --> 49:07.052
<i>and try to stay out of fights.</i>

49:07.154 --> 49:09.521
Yes, Father.

49:10.691 --> 49:14.076
But if you have to fight, win.

49:15.829 --> 49:19.615
Bran!
Bran, wake up!

49:29.927 --> 49:33.011
Bran! Bran!
Bran, wake up.

49:33.097 --> 49:35.881
- Bran! Bran, wake up!
- Hodor. Hodor.

49:41.805 --> 49:43.045
You have to wake up.

49:43.107 --> 49:45.357
- We need Hodor.
- Hodor. Hodor.

49:45.442 --> 49:47.092
<i>Bran, we need Hodor.</i>

49:47.194 --> 49:49.594
<i>Bran, you have to wake up.
We need Hodor.</i>

49:51.615 --> 49:53.949
Hodor. Hodor.

50:02.826 --> 50:04.442
Bran, we're all going to die!

50:04.545 --> 50:06.161
<i>Bran, wake up!</i>

50:06.247 --> 50:09.748
<i>We're all going to die!
Bran! Bran!</i>

50:09.833 --> 50:11.667
Bran, you have to wake up.
We need Hodor.

50:11.752 --> 50:13.335
Hodor. Hodor.

50:13.420 --> 50:15.671
Warg into Hodor now!

50:15.756 --> 50:17.839
<i>Bran, wake up.
We need Hodor.</i>

50:17.925 --> 50:21.059
<i>We need Hodor.
Warg into Hodor now! Now!</i>

50:21.145 --> 50:23.178
Listen to your friend, Brandon.

50:24.565 --> 50:26.398
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

50:26.483 --> 50:28.300
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

50:28.402 --> 50:30.485
Hodor.
Hodor.

51:05.222 --> 51:08.273
- Summer!
<i>- Go.</i>

51:08.359 --> 51:09.941
Go!

51:47.164 --> 51:49.204
<i>The time has come.</i>

51:51.769 --> 51:54.069
Leave me.

52:19.797 --> 52:21.930
- What are you doing?
- Go!

53:11.098 --> 53:13.131
Hodor, hurry!

53:13.233 --> 53:14.233
Hodor!

53:33.170 --> 53:34.870
Hold the door!

53:34.955 --> 53:37.339
<i>Hold the door!</i>

53:40.844 --> 53:42.677
<i>Hold the door!</i>

53:44.932 --> 53:47.349
<i>Hold the door!</i>

53:55.392 --> 53:57.392
Hold the door!

54:04.201 --> 54:05.951
<i>- Hold the door!
- Wylis!</i>

54:06.036 --> 54:07.702
What's the matter?

54:07.821 --> 54:10.539
- <i>Hold the door!</i>
- Come on, son.

54:10.657 --> 54:12.290
Hold the door!

54:18.131 --> 54:21.967
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

54:22.052 --> 54:25.420
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

54:25.506 --> 54:27.506
Hold the door!

54:27.591 --> 54:29.508
<i>Hold the door!</i>

54:57.371 --> 54:59.754
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

54:59.873 --> 55:02.507
<i>Hold the door!
Hold the door!</i>

55:02.593 --> 55:05.293
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

55:05.379 --> 55:08.013
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

55:08.098 --> 55:10.765
Hold the door!
Hold door!

55:10.884 --> 55:13.218
<i>Hold door!
Hold the door!</i>

55:13.303 --> 55:17.556
Hold the door!
Hold door! Hold door!

55:17.641 --> 55:20.442
Hold door!
Hodor!

55:20.561 --> 55:23.228
Hodor!
Hodor!

55:23.313 --> 55:25.897
Hodor! Hodor!

55:25.983 --> 55:27.382
Hodor!
