00:00.800 --> 00:02.260
<i>Previously on “Boston Legal”…</i>

00:02.300 --> 00:04.360
Jerry, you've made rather
a point of saying

00:04.400 --> 00:06.860
that this is the year
that you will make partner.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.460
There are many ways of
getting that job done, Jerry.

00:09.500 --> 00:13.000
Prancing around the office
as little Bo Peep

00:13.000 --> 00:14.860
is not one of the better ones.

00:14.900 --> 00:17.060
Do you know what happens to
lawyers who make partner, Jerry?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.500
They become locked-in… lifers.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.460
I'm not sure
that's something you want.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.060
Take off your pants, Denise.

00:23.100 --> 00:28.000
See, you like to talk.
I don't. I like to do.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.900
Surely you jest.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.644
My God, Denny.
Can you believe it?

00:36.900 --> 00:38.946
Election day
is almost upon us.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.460
–You gonna vote?
–Of course I'm gonna vote. Are you?

00:42.500 --> 00:44.360
Never missed
a presidential election.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.660
And I'm usually right, too.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.260
I've been on the winning side
8 times out of the last 11.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.016
–That's impressive.
–Yeah.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.960
Also an uncanny coincidence,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.498
since 8 out of the last 11
have also gone republican.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.800
Do tell.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.060
So you just <i>always</i>
vote republican?

01:00.100 --> 01:02.800
–I vote my values.
–So this week—

01:02.800 --> 01:04.860
I thought we weren't
gonna go there.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.682
You're right.
You're right.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.360
Who are you voting—
–Alan.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.060
Never mind. I'm not
looking to discuss it.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.000
I just… Who?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.100
McCain.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.100
Seriously?

01:19.100 --> 01:20.420
I'm serious. McCain.

01:21.000 --> 01:21.800
Ah.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.400
–Denny—
–Alan.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.984
You're right.
I'm sorry.

01:27.900 --> 01:28.760
–It's just…
–Come on.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.660
–…what would possibly possess—
–Hey.

01:30.700 --> 01:31.960
I'm sorry. Forget it.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.200
The important thing
is that we both vote.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.160
–That's right.
–To voting.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.300
Hear, hear.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.460
–It's just—
–Okay, that's it.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.160
No, no, no, no, no, no.
All right, how about this?

01:48.200 --> 01:50.900
I give you my word,
I will not speak.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.460
I will not open my mouth
if you'll just give me

01:53.500 --> 01:57.400
two reasons why you're voting
for John McCain—just two.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.460
That's a discussion.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.600
No, it's not.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.036
One person talking
does not a discussion make.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.000
Just two reasons.
I won't talk.

02:07.700 --> 02:08.600
Promise.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.200
Okay.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.038
If McCain wins,
he'll help save the salmon.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.718
–What?
–You're talking.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.500
I…

02:21.400 --> 02:23.660
The wild salmon stocks
in Canada are threatened,

02:23.700 --> 02:27.000
either by climate change,
fish farming, sea lice.

02:27.100 --> 02:30.160
Once the salmon go,
there goes half the ecosystem.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.850
I don't need to tell you.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.760
And, uh, McCain
will save them?

02:36.800 --> 02:38.300
–Not directly…
–Wh—

02:38.300 --> 02:40.660
…but the polls show
that if McCain wins,

02:40.700 --> 02:42.900
it's like a third term
of Bush.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.960
A lot of Americans
will immigrate to Canada,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.100
the smart ones.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.760
The intelligence level
of Canada goes up,

02:48.800 --> 02:51.836
and they'll figure out
how to save the salmon.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.352
And the second reason?

02:55.600 --> 02:56.600
Women…

02:57.300 --> 02:58.200
are easier…

02:59.100 --> 03:01.160
during a republican
administration.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.100
It's a fact.

03:02.100 --> 03:05.300
During democratic regimes,
volunteerism goes up.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.760
And you get a lot of women
running around for this cause or that,

03:08.800 --> 03:11.760
and they start to think that
they have something to say.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.660
Republicans tend
to reinforce the idea

03:13.700 --> 03:17.100
that woman's place
is in the home on her back.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.900
Now I'm not even
taking into account

03:20.200 --> 03:23.060
all the women that'll
be depressed if McCain wins.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.900
Sad girls are easy girls.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.060
I don't need to tell you.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.400
They're vulnerable.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.300
Salmon and women, Alan.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.960
In the end,
it's all about spawning.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.254
Drill, baby, drill.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.100
You vote your values.

<i>I think when you make
that decision,</i>

04:19.600 --> 04:21.860
<i>it might be well
if you would ask yourself:</i>

04:21.899 --> 04:25.800
<i>are you better off
than you were four years ago?</i>

04:26.100 --> 04:27.360
<i>Is it easier for you to go</i>

04:27.400 --> 04:28.960
<i>and buy things in a store?</i>
–You called?

04:29.000 --> 04:33.200
I did. I have a case I think
you'll enjoy second chairing.

04:33.200 --> 04:37.200
Oh, yes. I so enjoy sitting
in a courtroom all day long

04:37.300 --> 04:40.560
while you go on and on and on—
–Why are you being so nasty to me?

04:40.600 --> 04:42.260
This happens
to be a case you'll enjoy.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.860
In fact, the client
is a cattle rancher.

04:44.900 --> 04:45.956
So far, so good?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.046
Will I be allowed
to touch her?

04:50.100 --> 04:52.460
–The case involves mad cow.
–Does she have it?

04:52.500 --> 04:53.200
No.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.960
'Cause that would give us
a great deal in common.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.122
Denny, slow down.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.400
On her ranch,

04:57.400 --> 05:02.000
they test every cow to screen
for mad cow—every cow.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.360
–And?
–And now the government won't let her.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
Why not?

05:05.400 --> 05:06.360
Well, that's the question.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.060
So we're suing the United States
Department of Agriculture.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.212
It's an excellent cause.
–Great.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.686
Hey, Alan. You ready?

05:15.500 --> 05:16.760
Carol,
this is Denny Crane.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.060
He'll be second chairing.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.160
It'll be my mission in life
to get you off.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.660
I'm not charged with anything.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.700
Even so, you're the best client
I ever had.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.060
When shall I have you?
–What is up with this guy?

05:28.100 --> 05:30.360
He likes to make
a good first impression.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.660
Yeah? Well,
he's running out of time.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.700
Let's go.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.700
Oh, my God.

06:04.700 --> 06:05.900
Jerry.

06:05.900 --> 06:06.900
Carl.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.746
What can I do you for,
big guy?

06:11.300 --> 06:12.000
Sorry.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.860
Ever go to the 28th floor?

06:13.900 --> 06:14.960
Not if I can help it.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.860
Do you know what happens
on the 28th floor, Jerry?

06:16.900 --> 06:18.960
I was a tax attorney here
for seven years, Carl.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.860
I'm quite familiar
with what goes on there.

06:20.900 --> 06:24.760
Hmm. Well, the 28th floor is where
the big conference room is, Jerry,

06:24.800 --> 06:28.360
where they assemble all of
the administrative partners.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.160
You know who I mean.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.160
The ones that have
that silly annual meeting

06:31.200 --> 06:33.060
where they decide
who makes partner.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.500
Yes, Carl, I get it.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.400
Okay. Now I've already
recommended you.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.660
Whether that'll be enough—
–Will Shirley recommend me?

06:43.700 --> 06:46.160
She did, but she's
in Colorado at the moment,

06:46.200 --> 06:47.460
so she can't present herself
in person.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.560
Why is she in Colorado?

06:48.600 --> 06:52.000
We have a—
<i>She</i> has a second home there.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.660
She figured since Massachusetts
is in the bag,

06:54.700 --> 06:55.960
that she should
make her vote count.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.260
Colorado is still up for grabs,
so she registered to vote there.

06:59.300 --> 06:59.960
A bit odd, isn't it?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.660
Shouldn't it be about
who gets the most votes,

07:01.700 --> 07:03.460
not which state
the vote comes from?

07:03.500 --> 07:05.480
That would be too easy,
Katie.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.160
Congratulations, Jerry.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.302
–If I make it.
–You'll make it. It's your time.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.300
You?

07:17.600 --> 07:19.260
And what is wrong with me?

07:19.300 --> 07:21.800
Oh, nothing.
You seem perfect,

07:21.800 --> 07:26.060
as delicious and repressed
as ever in your crisply pressed blouse.

07:26.100 --> 07:26.900
Alan.

07:26.900 --> 07:29.700
–Ah.
<i>–Denise.</i>

07:29.700 --> 07:31.100
How's the baby?

07:31.100 --> 07:32.600
She's, um, wonderful.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.960
I see
you got your figure back.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.584
I see you've kept yours.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.584
–Sex later?
–We'll talk.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.600
All rise.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.300
“Docket number 4-7-7-5-6-2—

07:42.300 --> 07:43.260
<i>–“Hober ranch vs.”…</i>
–That was just lawyer banter.

I would never stray on you.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.960
<i>“The United States

07:47.000 --> 07:47.960
Good morning, your honor.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.760
It's us— your favorite
litigants. We're back again.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.860
I'm sure you're not surprised.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.000
No, no, I am not,

07:54.500 --> 07:58.260
especially since, once again,
you're suing the government.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.860
If I had a nickel for every—
–How about this?

08:00.900 --> 08:02.960
We'll write you a check,
you rule in our favor—

08:03.000 --> 08:04.360
It'll be just like old times.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.960
Speaking of old times,
look who's against us.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.100
Denise Bauer—here to
sweep us off our feet.

08:10.100 --> 08:13.460
And check out our client. She
sweeps everybody off their feet.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.460
Everywhere you look,
it's sweeps, sweeps, sweeps.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.668
Do we write that check out
to you personally or—

08:20.000 --> 08:22.800
What is this stupid case
about anyway?

08:22.800 --> 08:26.160
Judge, I'll tell you what it's
about. I run a cattle ranch.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.160
I sell beef. I test my cattle
for mad cow disease.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.860
I test every single animal.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.960
The government's put a stop to it.
–Why?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.860
Why? Because the other
meat packers, the bigger ones—

08:35.900 --> 08:37.159
you know, the ones that have
bought and paid

08:37.200 --> 08:39.159
For the U.S. D.A.—they don't
want to test every cow.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.159
It's too expensive,
but if they don't test,

08:41.200 --> 08:43.159
they're afraid the consumer
won't buy their meat.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.960
I'm sorry, your honor, but if
she's going to testify—

08:46.000 --> 08:47.060
Oh, sweetie, I'm not testifying—

08:47.100 --> 08:49.360
But you are, in the narrative,
so if you'd like to take

08:49.400 --> 08:52.460
that chair up there, that's
fine, but I want my licks.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.500
Take a number.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.060
Hold on! We will conduct
an evidentiary hearing,

08:56.100 --> 08:58.260
and we shall conduct it
forthwith.

08:58.300 --> 09:01.900

Mr Shore, you can go first,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
and you can put
your expert up here.

09:16.700 --> 09:17.860
Katie. Welcome. Hello.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.500
Hey. That's a bit catchy,
I must say.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.400
It's kind of
a motivational chant,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.446
an “I can do it”
sort of thing.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.460
It's possible
the administrative partners

09:28.500 --> 09:29.760
will call me in
for an interview,

09:29.800 --> 09:31.252
so I want to be ready.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.100
Ah. Jerry,
they've called me.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.100
You? Why?

09:37.500 --> 09:38.460
I can't imagine.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.960
I shouldn't think it's because I'm
being considered for partnership.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.060
I suspect they're asking me to
proffer testimony of sorts on you.

09:46.100 --> 09:50.400
Oh. Well…
What will you say?

09:50.700 --> 09:53.060
Well, only wonderful things
of course.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.260
I'll tell them
you're a very dear man

09:55.300 --> 09:57.860
who pops and purrs
and chicka-chicka-choos

09:57.900 --> 09:59.660
with the best
and the brightest.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.878
Only wonderful things,
I promise.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.344
I've been waiting
for this, Katie.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.360
When I came back
to this firm,

10:10.400 --> 10:11.918
it was mainly for this:

10:12.900 --> 10:16.500
to get something
I was denied the first time,

10:17.500 --> 10:20.500
<i>something
I so rightly deserved,</i>

10:21.300 --> 10:23.808
something I was gypped out of
because…

10:26.300 --> 10:28.610
Listen to me,
I sound like Hillary.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.960
First of all, we have
no real way of knowing

10:45.000 --> 10:47.560
how widespread mad cow disease
is among humans.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.260
The symptoms are similar to
Alzheimer's,

10:49.300 --> 10:50.660
so the diagnosis—
–Objection.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.860
Your honor, the witness
is not competent

10:52.900 --> 10:55.260
to offer a medical opinion.
–It's a lay opinion.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.960
This is common knowledge
that's out there.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.160
We don't know,
so why not be safe?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.660
That's the policy
at my ranch.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.700
We want to test every cow
so we can be safe.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.160
How dare the federal government
say I can't do so?

11:06.200 --> 11:08.260
Ms Hober, I think
the government would argue

11:08.300 --> 11:10.860
that the testing of every cow
isn't necessary since—

11:10.900 --> 11:11.900
So what?

11:11.900 --> 11:13.760
Why should they prohibit
<i>us</i> from doing so

11:13.800 --> 11:15.560
if we're willing to bear
the expense?

11:15.600 --> 11:17.316
It's ludicrous.
–Ms Hober.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.460
Oh, look, even if you think
our testing is overkill,

11:19.500 --> 11:21.000
I repeat, so what?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.560
The U.S.D.A. testing
requirements are pathetic.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.500
Why?

11:24.500 --> 11:26.460
Let me put it this way:
right now,

11:26.500 --> 11:29.160
slaughterhouses can pick
which cow they choose to test.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.360
It's voluntary. So basically,
they can cherry-pick

11:31.400 --> 11:33.560
the ones that look healthy,
which is exactly what they do.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.260
If one looks sick, you think
they're gonna test that one

11:35.300 --> 11:38.360
and risk getting their plant
shut down? It's a joke.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.960
The last study showed that fewer
than one in one million adult cattle

11:42.000 --> 11:43.660
were affected
with mad cow disease—

11:43.700 --> 11:47.160
And that would make you feel better
if you ate the bad burger?

11:47.200 --> 11:49.760
I want to make sure
<i>none</i> of mine are infected.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.660
And by the way,

11:50.700 --> 11:54.860
95% of people are willing
to pay the extra cost for that guarantee.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.660
So why won't the government
let me?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.460
Yes, I believe you've made
that point.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.960
Well, why don't I make
another point, okay?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.160
Maybe meat packers could make
more money if they did test,

12:04.200 --> 12:06.660
because right now,
there are 65 countries

12:06.700 --> 12:08.900
that restrict
imported U.S. meat

12:08.900 --> 12:11.660
<i>Because</i> the testing
is so inadequate.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.260
Ah, so now you want to tell them
how to run their business?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.360
How about they not tell me
how to run mine?

12:16.400 --> 12:18.160
I mean, what is up with
the Department of Agriculture?

12:18.200 --> 12:19.460
Would somebody
please fill me in?

12:19.500 --> 12:21.810
Besides maybe
some giant bribe job?

12:22.400 --> 12:23.600
Oh, all right.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.860
Try to be as unbiased
as possible.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.460
If you speak as a loyal friend,
you'll be less persuasive.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.060
Just stay objective…
–Okay.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.260
–And respectful.
–Unbiased, objective, respectful—got it.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.600
Now we're not so much
interested in old history.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.960
Most of us are fairly caught up
to the point

12:44.000 --> 12:46.860
where he attacked
Shirley Schmidt with a knife.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.276
He's been doing
much better of late.

12:49.600 --> 12:53.560
Yes, and we see that he's had an
excellent track record as a litigator.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.460
Carl Sack and Shirley Schmidt
have spoken highly.

12:56.500 --> 13:01.900
But, Katie… Jerry has
remained fairly segregated

13:01.900 --> 13:03.880
from almost everybody but you.

13:03.900 --> 13:07.600
As you know, part of being
a partner is people skills.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.922
Jerry's are fine.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.160
He may startle people at first
with his various ticks,

13:12.200 --> 13:15.360
but anyone that spends more than
a minute with him knows him to be a man

13:15.400 --> 13:17.842
of exemplary warmth
and intelligence.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.900
–Does he date?
–Is that relevant?

13:20.900 --> 13:22.660
Well, not necessarily,
but we're told

13:22.700 --> 13:25.860
he was with a woman last year
who left him for an iPhone.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.660
That spoke more to
her character flaws than his.

13:28.700 --> 13:32.060
We're told he's had a relationship
with an inanimate doll.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.014
Uh, that was
a prop of sorts,

13:34.200 --> 13:36.860
for him to develop
intimacy skills with women,

13:36.900 --> 13:39.960
which skills have improved.
He no longer sees the doll.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.260
Why is it he walks around with
his hands glued to his thighs?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.760
Jerry has Asperger's syndrome.
His ha—

13:45.800 --> 13:48.660
I'm not quite comfortable with
the tenor of these questions.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.160
If the purpose of this interview
is to characterize Jerry

13:51.200 --> 13:52.860
as some sort of weirdo who—

13:52.900 --> 13:54.560
Katie, it's not that at all.
It's just—

13:54.600 --> 13:59.000
Just what? Jerry has
various quirks and manners.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.360
That makes him a bit different.
He's not odd. He is not weird.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.360
I should think you'd be
privileged to have him.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.960
A partnership is a little different
from employment, Ms Lloyd.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.360
It's not just about
his lawyering skills

14:09.400 --> 14:10.760
or whether he's a warm person.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.660
It's about how well
he fits in with the group.

14:13.700 --> 14:15.560
Will we feel comfortable
with each other?

14:15.600 --> 14:17.560
Will he blend in with others?
Will he—

14:17.600 --> 14:20.174
Is that why I see
no black people here?

14:21.900 --> 14:24.700
That was
an inappropriate remark, Katie.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.260
Well, it's just when I hear,

14:26.300 --> 14:27.860
“Who we'll feel
comfortable with,”

14:27.900 --> 14:29.900
it brings up ugly overtones.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.360
When I look and see an old white
establishment in this room

14:33.400 --> 14:37.492
and hear terms like “fitting in,”
it sounds a bit frightening.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.560
Jerry Espenson could quite
bring something to this table

14:39.600 --> 14:41.860
that might be lacking,
better yet, needed.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.860
I realize I'm British
and might sound like

14:43.900 --> 14:45.060
a bit of a bigot
when I say this,

14:45.100 --> 14:47.560
but why are Americans
so bloody committed to

14:47.600 --> 14:51.060
the past or the present when
everything is falling apart?

14:51.100 --> 14:52.560
You're all making less money,

14:52.600 --> 14:55.260
your reputation and status
continues to plunge

14:55.300 --> 14:57.260
among law schools
both here and abroad,

14:57.300 --> 14:58.960
and yet, you're afraid
of change?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.260
You don't need to get
so upset, Katie.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.300
Maybe I do.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.160
I was recruited to this firm
with various promises

15:05.200 --> 15:06.960
of progressiveness
and tolerance.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.560
It a bit demoralizing to see,
behind all the talk,

15:09.600 --> 15:13.460
the same ol' white boys' club
plans to do business as usual.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.460
I smell discrimination
in the dusty air,

15:15.500 --> 15:18.470
and I'm not just annoyed,
I'm a bit appalled.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.500
Objective and respectful!

15:34.500 --> 15:35.860
Which part
of that little diatribe—

15:35.900 --> 15:38.560
–I'm sorry, but when I hear—
–Apologize to Jerry.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.778
He's the one you screwed,
not me.

15:40.900 --> 15:41.956
What's going on?

15:42.900 --> 15:43.824
What happened?

15:45.100 --> 15:48.664
I got a little cross with
the administrative partners.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.500
It did not go well, Jerry.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.200
Oh.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.000
Am I out?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.046
Uh, they want to meet
with you.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.660
Jerry, it's very important
that you come off

15:58.700 --> 16:00.500
as reasonable, thoughtful,

16:00.500 --> 16:03.338
as opposed to a pit bull
with the lipstick.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.102
Whatever they ask,
simply respect the question,

16:07.200 --> 16:08.560
not to mention
the person asking it.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.160
And then provide a sound,
deliberate answer. Basically,

16:11.200 --> 16:15.490
I'm telling you the same thing
I so <i>wish</i> I had told Katie.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.120
I'm so sorry, Jerry.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.260
I don't think it went
as badly as Carl suggests,

16:26.300 --> 16:28.500
but… I did get cross
with them.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.300
What happened?

16:31.600 --> 16:34.372
Well, the questions implied
that you were…

16:34.700 --> 16:36.300
socially challenged,

16:36.300 --> 16:38.280
and I'm afraid I took offense.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.260
Well, first of all,

16:48.300 --> 16:50.460
testing can't detect
mad cow disease

16:50.500 --> 16:52.660
until shortly before
the cow develops symptoms.

16:52.700 --> 16:53.400
So…

16:53.400 --> 16:57.060
Well, cattle are typically slaughtered
between 18 and 24 months of age,

16:57.100 --> 17:00.060
and that's typically long before
the disease is detectable.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.960
Look, all this talk about
testing, testing, testing—

17:03.000 --> 17:05.760
the reality is, testing
can't make a difference.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.960
So then why bother with testing
at all, Mr Beavis?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.060
Well, I suppose if it's
even possible it could help…

17:12.099 --> 17:15.359
Uh, and let's face it,
the public wants to feel safe.

17:15.400 --> 17:19.359
So if testing gives them some
confidence in the meat industry,

17:19.400 --> 17:20.720
that's a good thing.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.800
Okay, even if it's only possible
that testing could help,

17:24.800 --> 17:28.500
even if it only provides
a-a psychological lift,

17:28.500 --> 17:31.860
what grounds do you have for
stopping my client from testing?

17:31.900 --> 17:33.660
I'll tell you the grounds,
wise guy.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.860
–Wise guy?
–When <i>she</i> advertises

17:35.900 --> 17:37.960
that she tests
every single one of her cows,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.460
but she's the only one
who does so…

17:39.500 --> 17:40.360
Which is the truth.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.560
…she implies that her meat is
safe, and that other meat isn't,

17:43.600 --> 17:44.760
And that is bad
for the industry.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.660
Yeah, but you didn't ban
the advertising, Mr Beavis.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.860
Or is it Butt-Head? You banned
the actual testing itself.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.360
And by the way,
when did it become the goal

17:53.400 --> 17:56.060
of the Department of Agriculture
to protect the meat industry?

17:56.100 --> 17:58.060
I always thought it was to
safeguard the public,

17:58.100 --> 18:00.060
but then again, I'm a wise guy.
–Alan.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.660
This disease kills,
not just the cows, but people.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.360
Have you ever had somebody
you love die of mad cow?

18:05.400 --> 18:07.260
No, and I'll bet
neither have you.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.006
It may very well be
that somebody I love…

18:13.100 --> 18:16.400
There could be
many, many people out there

18:16.400 --> 18:20.800
diagnosed with Alzheimer's
that, in fact, ate bad beef.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.760
Look, if you say that
outside this court,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.060
you're gonna
get your ass sued.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.360
I mean, do you think
you're bigger than Oprah?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.560
If you want to sue me,
go ahead.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.660
It won't be me. It'll be
the American cattle association.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.160
Same thing, though— American cattle,
Department of Agriculture.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.360
–Objection.
–And what's with you?

18:33.400 --> 18:35.660
I never object to you.
In fact, I quite approve—

18:35.700 --> 18:38.500
–Alan.
–Why can't she test her cows?

18:38.600 --> 18:39.960
What's the federal government
trying to hide?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.320
Alan, it's not fair.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.460
Just because you're in front of
a judge who's afraid of you

18:43.500 --> 18:45.660
doesn't give you the right
to exploit the situation.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.360
Who says I'm afraid of him?

18:47.400 --> 18:51.200
Uh, he does. Uh, he used to
say it to me all the time.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.060
If you rant long enough,
judge Brown will cower.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.000
Um, namby-pamby, I believe…

18:56.000 --> 18:57.660
–Oh, judge, I never said—
–…is the word he used.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.860
–How dare you?
–She's making that up.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.800
No, I'm not.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.060
–Yes—
–Silence! We'll see who's afraid.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.146
–It's me. I'm afraid.
–Silence.

19:08.700 --> 19:09.400
You lied.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.900
Did I? Oh, I'm sorry.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.274
Well, that was a sneaky move
by Denise.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.700
Sneaky, unscrupulous,
crafty…

19:25.400 --> 19:27.100
–Worthy of us.
–Exactly.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.200
She's deliberately
trying to fluster me.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.600
–Ask her how Brad is.
–What?

19:35.600 --> 19:39.160
She was never really in love
with Brad. We bo know that.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.060
She got pregnant
with his kid,

19:41.100 --> 19:44.600
so they pretended
to love each other, got married.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.800
Ask her how Brad is.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.846
I'll bet
that puts her on tilt.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.360
Denny, that's genius.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.568
Of course it is. I know
how to make women crazy.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.470
I just can't seem to
make them crazy over me.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.618
No progress with Carol?

20:02.300 --> 20:03.300
Nah, none.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.460
You know, Denny,
you'll never win her heart

20:05.500 --> 20:07.860
by voting for four more years
of George Bush tomorrow.

20:07.900 --> 20:10.804
–Here we go. I'm outta here.
– Denny. Denny.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.652
Just think about that.

20:14.200 --> 20:14.960
You know
what your problem is?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.460
You expect people to
think about things first.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.660
In politics, you go with
your gut, what feels good.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.960
You don't blink, you don't
think, you don't hesitate.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.860
You hesitate, your enemies
think you're weak.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.360
When will you stupid democrats
ever learn?

20:27.400 --> 20:29.314
It's no wonder you never win.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.760
No promises, but I might
be able to get them

20:49.800 --> 20:53.260
to wiggle on the testing ban
if you agree not to advertise.

20:53.300 --> 20:54.760
Now how stupid is that?

20:54.800 --> 20:56.360
One of the reasons
I spend the extra money

20:56.400 --> 20:59.260
is so I can say to the consumer,
”we test every cow.“

20:59.300 --> 21:01.160
Well, I'm sorry,
but that sends the message

21:01.200 --> 21:03.360
that the meat industry
as a whole isn't safe.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.000
It isn't.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.386
–Look—
–No, you look.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.160
If you're so concerned
about the meat industry,

21:07.200 --> 21:08.322
get them to test.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.974
Alan, you mind
controlling your client?

21:13.100 --> 21:13.900
Brad.

21:15.100 --> 21:15.800
What?

21:16.500 --> 21:17.500
How's Brad?

21:18.400 --> 21:20.380
You know
how I love to travel.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.560
I know Brad likes to travel.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.100
I suddenly found myself
fantasizing

21:24.100 --> 21:25.860
about all the places
he gets to go—

21:25.900 --> 21:31.800
Tropical, moist, exotic places
I've always so yearned to visit.

21:32.300 --> 21:33.488
You're disgusting.

21:33.700 --> 21:34.888
But you knew that.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.960
You haven't answered
my question.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.460
–What question?
–How's Brad?

21:38.500 --> 21:39.760
Brad's gone.
We're not together.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.900
Can we move on?

21:43.300 --> 21:44.600
–Hmm.
–I'm sorry,

21:45.100 --> 21:47.160
but what is it with
you demented people?

21:47.200 --> 21:48.360
It's how we practice law.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.800
Look, I am not agreeing
not to advertise.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.314
–Then we don't settle.
–Fine.

21:55.300 --> 21:58.800
You look sad.
Maybe you shouldn't be alone.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.000
Back off, fat boy.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.016
Are you getting a divorce?

22:04.300 --> 22:04.900
Yep.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.854
It didn't work out.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.788
Denise, I'm sorry.

22:15.100 --> 22:15.800
Yeah.

22:53.000 --> 22:53.990
Hello. Welcome.

22:54.700 --> 22:55.860
How are you, Jerry?

22:55.900 --> 22:57.022
Oh, I'm splendid.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.922
A little fraught.

23:00.300 --> 23:03.060
Jerry, let me first say
that we are all agreed here

23:03.100 --> 23:06.160
that we think you've
been doing a splendid job.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.660
That being said, however,

23:07.700 --> 23:11.600
there are some concerns
regarding your social skills.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.660
Yes, I understand. I think
I've made progress in that area.

23:14.700 --> 23:15.954
Thank you. Welcome.

23:17.200 --> 23:21.100
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

23:21.500 --> 23:23.414
Denny Crane,
glad to see you.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.560
Big firm meeting,
didn't invite me?

23:26.600 --> 23:29.000
Denny, this is
an administrative—

23:29.000 --> 23:31.046
Hey, Paul,
I know what this is.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.960
Let me save you some time.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.060
See this?
This is me, Denny Crane—

23:35.100 --> 23:37.760
founding partner
of Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.060
Look around the room,
I don't see a Poole.

23:39.100 --> 23:42.400
Don't see a Schmidt.
I see this: Crane.

23:43.700 --> 23:44.600
Bottom line—

23:45.600 --> 23:47.200
this man makes partner,

23:47.200 --> 23:50.368
or I walk and take my name
off the door with me.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.600
<i>Comprende?
Parlez-vous?</i>

23:52.900 --> 23:55.100
<i>Sprechen sie deutsch?</i>

24:01.500 --> 24:03.414
Denny Crane.
Have a good day.

24:08.600 --> 24:09.700
Well…

24:09.700 --> 24:12.736
one might think that
that would carry the day,

24:13.400 --> 24:14.918
but one would be wrong.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.100
Denny doesn't carry

24:17.200 --> 24:19.800
even a plurality
equitable interest.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.900
Come on, Paul.

24:20.900 --> 24:24.100
The name of the firm
is Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

24:24.100 --> 24:27.060
Denny Crane has become
a liability of late, Carl.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.860
He may have just given us the
perfect way to finally unload him.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.300
If Denny goes, I go.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.860
That's very admirable,
Mr Espenson,

24:33.900 --> 24:37.360
But I really don't think you're
well-situated to be issuing ultimatums.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.710
It's not
an ultimatum, it's a fact.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.160
If he walks, I walk.
Alan Shore might, too.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.360
Maybe even Carl. Who knows?
We could do a spin-off.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.260
Don't think we haven't
been approached already.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.860
Hell, it's not like you want
the bunch of us anyway.

24:48.900 --> 24:51.078
The network sure doesn't.
–Jerry.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.200
I apologize.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.000
Hmm, I do retreat into…

24:58.400 --> 25:00.800
well, a wooden cigarette

25:01.700 --> 25:03.400
when I feel insecure,

25:03.400 --> 25:05.700
which I feel a lot, admittedly.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.960
I realize that alone
might disqualify me

25:09.000 --> 25:10.584
as partnership material.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.700
But might I say…

25:14.600 --> 25:17.200
in an arena
where cutthroat is good,

25:17.800 --> 25:21.400
where a “take no prisoners,
eat your young” mentality

25:21.400 --> 25:23.000
so often prevails,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.060
it might be nice for a law firm
to include somebody

25:26.100 --> 25:29.400
who treats others
with selflessness and kindness,

25:29.600 --> 25:34.000
virtues perhaps more noble
than unilateralism

25:34.000 --> 25:35.600
and tough-guy bravado.

25:36.900 --> 25:40.398
Maybe it's time for you
to start looking for somebody

25:40.600 --> 25:43.900
who can embrace values like…

25:46.800 --> 25:49.200
humility, graciousness,

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
compassion,

25:52.000 --> 25:55.300
All tempered with intelligence.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.400
Maybe the bullying days
are over.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.500
–All set?
–For what?

26:28.900 --> 26:31.060
We gotta go vote, man.
The polls close in a few hours.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.060
They're open till 8:00.

26:32.100 --> 26:35.060
We gotta get back to court soon.
–Let's not wait too long.

26:35.100 --> 26:38.004
Denny, are you really
gonna vote for McCain?

26:38.700 --> 26:40.160
I thought we said we weren't
gonna discuss this.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.560
Well, I want to discuss it,
damn it.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.660
The consequences are too big.
–Bigger than our friendship?

26:44.700 --> 26:46.000
You know what? Yes.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.260
Why are you voting
for John McCain?

26:49.300 --> 26:51.478
And don't tell me
salmon and sex.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.886
I want a real answer.

26:55.100 --> 26:55.900
All right.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.760
Taxes— Obama's gonna raise 'em.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.360
I don't want to—
–No, he won't. That's a blatant lie.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.600
Obama plans to raise taxes
only for the rich,

27:06.600 --> 27:08.660
those earning
over $250,000 a year.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.360
You know
what your problem is?

27:10.400 --> 27:12.900
Yeah, a collapsing economy,
two wars—

27:12.900 --> 27:13.600
No.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.068
Democrats don't know how to win.
Republicans do.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.060
Maybe instead of so smugly
celebrating the fact

27:20.100 --> 27:21.660
that republicans
know how to win,

27:21.700 --> 27:23.960
might you be
the least bit disgusted

27:24.000 --> 27:25.260
at the tactics
they resort to…

27:25.300 --> 27:27.360
–Oh, please.
–The despicable pandering,

27:27.400 --> 27:29.800
like supporting gas tax holidays

27:29.900 --> 27:31.960
or cozying up
to the evangelicals

27:32.000 --> 27:34.100
or the most egregious example

27:34.100 --> 27:35.660
of political pandering
in memory—

27:35.700 --> 27:37.660
John McCain's choice
of running mate?

27:37.700 --> 27:40.400
Well, at least
she's run something.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.360
A town called Wasilla,
which she left in debt—

27:43.400 --> 27:46.560
She had executive experience,
including foreign policy.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.460
Foreign policy? What, she can
see Russia on a clear day?

27:49.500 --> 27:52.060
Can she spell Russia?
–She's just as qualified as…

27:52.100 --> 27:52.660
–Denny…
–…as, uh—

27:52.700 --> 27:55.600
She couldn't name
any newspapers she read

27:55.600 --> 27:57.460
or supreme court decisions—
–Gotcha journalism. It was the network—

27:57.500 --> 27:59.960
Gotcha journalism?
Naming a supreme court case?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.860
Look, this isn't about Palin .

28:01.900 --> 28:04.060
It's about McCain.
–Okay, well, what if he dies?

28:04.100 --> 28:05.700
–Who?
–McCain!

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
Of the last 19 administrations,
almost half—

28:10.000 --> 28:12.760
Half!— have had situations where
the vice president had to assume

28:12.800 --> 28:15.060
presidential responsibilities
if not complete control.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.660
Reagan had Alzheimer's.
His approval rating went up.

28:17.700 --> 28:19.800
Denny, John McCain is 72.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.860
He'd be the oldest person
<i>ever</i> to assume office.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.260
He's ripe for a heart attack,

28:24.300 --> 28:26.460
Not to mention
he's had melanoma four times.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.260
There's a very real possibility
he could die.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.460
And then what? We'll be left
with Sarah Palin?

28:31.500 --> 28:34.260
Is there anybody anywhere
who's really okay with that?

28:34.300 --> 28:36.160
–Yes, they're called Americans!
–Oh, Denny.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.060
–The joe six-pack, the small—
–Joe six-pack needs somebody

28:39.100 --> 28:41.160
to fix the economy,
not have a beer with!

28:41.200 --> 28:42.760
I don't hear anything
coming from Obama!

28:42.800 --> 28:44.760
You don't hear anything
<i>at all</i> from John McCain.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.860
His own camp says
“don't talk about it.

28:46.900 --> 28:48.660
Instead, we'll just
go negative.” It's despicable.

28:48.700 --> 28:49.860
Obama's gone negative, too…

28:49.900 --> 28:52.260
That bulldog in lipstick
says Obama pals around

28:52.300 --> 28:54.060
with terrorists…
–Oh, and Obama loves to play those ads…

28:54.100 --> 28:55.260
It's beneath gutter politics.
It's shameful.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.160
–…about McCain…
–Smear…

28:56.200 --> 28:57.560
–…and the keating five.
–…cynical, disgusting smear…

28:57.600 --> 28:58.860
And that's the high ground?

28:58.900 --> 29:00.560
And if this represents
the direction he plans

29:00.600 --> 29:01.460
to lead us after eight years
of the Bush administration—

29:01.500 --> 29:03.300
Change, change, change!

29:03.300 --> 29:04.560
Well, McCain's camp just spews
out hate-fled demagoguery—

29:04.600 --> 29:06.800
Yes, we can! Yes, we can!

29:06.800 --> 29:08.060
–Some maverick.
–What—What—What—Oh!

29:08.100 --> 29:12.400
Maverick, maverick, maverick!
Maverick, maverick, maverick!

29:12.400 --> 29:15.100
–Ow! You shot me!
–Damn right, I did.

29:15.100 --> 29:17.344
Denny, that hurt me.
For God sake…

29:18.600 --> 29:21.960
–Oh! You got me in the back!
–Well, that'll teach ya.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.500
–Ow! Ow!
–All even now.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.760
You could've shot my eye out,
you crazy—

29:26.800 --> 29:29.700
Don't <i>ever</i>
raise a gun to me—Oh!

29:29.700 --> 29:32.600
Happy now? Ah! Ah!

29:42.500 --> 29:46.300
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

29:57.700 --> 29:58.800
Politics.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.260
What's going on
with you two?

30:15.300 --> 30:16.100
Nothing.

30:16.300 --> 30:17.000
Nothing.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.400
Hi, guys.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.960
Denny and I are fighting.

30:33.000 --> 30:33.900
Oh, got it.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.600
Denise, listen…

30:38.700 --> 30:39.600
I…

30:41.100 --> 30:45.900
I'm very sorry about being
so flippant about you and Brad.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.160
It's just—it felt like
you were trying to unnerve me,

30:49.200 --> 30:53.600
and… I resorted to
a little gamesmanship myself.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.600
And I've been…
feeling terrible about it.

30:57.300 --> 31:00.500
Well, Alan,
don't beat yourself up about it.

31:00.500 --> 31:04.000
–No—
–I mean, do if it'll compromise your closing.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.800
You know, not to be, uh,
disgustingly opportunistic,

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
but I always felt
that there was

31:12.000 --> 31:14.900
unfinished business
between the two of us—

31:15.100 --> 31:17.278
uh, actually,
unstarted business,

31:17.500 --> 31:19.700
and, well—
–I would love it.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.200
Would you?

31:25.600 --> 31:27.250
If only I wasn't married.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.582
But you and Brad are split.

31:30.700 --> 31:34.066
Well, I might have fudged
the facts a little there.

31:36.100 --> 31:36.760
Which facts?

31:36.800 --> 31:39.572
Mm, the part about
Brad and I being split.

31:39.900 --> 31:42.800
The truth is,
we've never been happier.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.200
I'm gonna get him
to send you a postcard

31:46.300 --> 31:50.100
From one of his moist,
exotic destinations.

31:51.100 --> 31:54.200
Mm. Time for court, Al.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.200
Jerry.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.400
For what it's worth…

32:18.400 --> 32:20.314
I thought
you did a good job.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.560
Could've done without
the wooden cigarette

32:22.600 --> 32:24.060
or the talk about the spin-off,

32:24.100 --> 32:27.400
but I thought you presented
yourself in good form.

32:27.700 --> 32:28.400
Thank you.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.760
Do we know when they'll make
their decision?

32:32.800 --> 32:33.700
Um…

32:34.600 --> 32:36.448
They have already, actually.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.084
You made partner, Jerry.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.900
Are you… teasing me?

32:49.400 --> 32:51.600
No, I am not teasing you.

32:53.900 --> 32:57.160
It is my privilege— and I do
mean it when I say privilege—

32:57.200 --> 33:00.260
to inform you that an offer
of full partnership

33:00.300 --> 33:01.950
has been extended to you.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.500
Thank you. Thank you.

33:12.700 --> 33:13.800
Congratulations.

33:14.100 --> 33:14.900
Thank you.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.380
Aren't you gonna at least pop…

33:24.900 --> 33:26.600
hop, purr for God sake?

33:27.100 --> 33:30.862
You must have a-a celebratory
tick you've been saving up.

33:30.900 --> 33:33.012
It's not that big a deal,
Katie.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.100
It's good.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.220
It's a nice feather.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.082
But it's… it's really just…

33:58.400 --> 34:02.100
Can anybody explain
the logic behind this?

34:02.200 --> 34:04.460
The federal government—
our government—

34:04.500 --> 34:07.100
is actually
prohibiting a company

34:07.200 --> 34:10.764
from exceeding regulations
to make its products safer.

34:10.800 --> 34:11.800
I'm baffled.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.460
It's one thing to say that our
government can no longer protect us.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.659
We've seen that with the FDA,
which has failed

34:17.699 --> 34:20.360
to regulate drugs
that have, in fact, killed us.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.260
We've seen our government
undercut regulation

34:23.300 --> 34:25.159
by the consumer product
safety commission,

34:25.199 --> 34:27.159
paving the way for
an influx of, uh,

34:27.199 --> 34:29.000
deadly lead-coated imports.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.159
We've seen the S.E.C,

34:30.199 --> 34:31.960
in deference
to free-market capitalists,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.100
go M.I.A. on Wall Street,

34:34.100 --> 34:36.659
essentially leading to
an economic implosion.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.760
And John McCain wants to
deregulate health care, God forbid.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.960
I mean, I-I suppose all of that
can be attributed to

34:43.000 --> 34:45.300
simple greed and incompetence,

34:45.300 --> 34:49.699
but this— this is
a new tactic altogether.

34:50.100 --> 34:55.600
This goes beyond scrapping regulation
in favor of big business interests.

34:55.600 --> 35:02.100
This is our government deliberately
taking steps to actually thwart our safety.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.000
There can be no possible explanation

35:05.000 --> 35:07.360
for banning my client
from testing her cows

35:07.400 --> 35:10.260
other than the most blatant
and malignant one:

35:10.300 --> 35:13.260
that the USDA has been bought off
by the big meat packers,

35:13.300 --> 35:16.660
who don't want to bear the added
expense of doing the same testing.

35:16.700 --> 35:19.900
We've seen big pharmaceutical
buy off the FDA.

35:19.900 --> 35:25.000
We've certainly seen big oil help
craft US energy policy, for God's sake.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.360
The tobacco industry still spends
$20 million a year lobbying Congress.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.700
But even if you're somehow willing

35:30.700 --> 35:33.860
to accept this “money talks”
approach to government,

35:33.900 --> 35:35.960
how can it get to a point where—

35:36.000 --> 35:37.960
she just wants to
make sure her beef is safe.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.178
I mean, whose government is this?

35:42.500 --> 35:43.500
I agree.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.700
Ms Bauer…

35:46.900 --> 35:48.500
this is shocking,

35:48.600 --> 35:50.100
outrageous…

35:50.100 --> 35:51.500
indecent.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.060
I don't know who the department of
agriculture thinks it's working for,

35:54.100 --> 35:58.100
but it is certainly not me
or my grandchildren.

35:58.100 --> 36:00.500
This ridiculous ban is—

36:00.500 --> 36:02.200
is overruled.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.100
My God!

36:04.900 --> 36:06.300
We're adjourned.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.700
Yes.

36:08.900 --> 36:09.660
I don't know about you,

36:09.700 --> 36:13.460
but I like to cap off my victories
with a simple toast and a poke.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.424
How about you?

36:14.800 --> 36:16.500
Mr Shore, thank you.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.560
And may I say before I leave,
my gratitude notwithstanding,

36:19.600 --> 36:22.260
you two are the weirdest lawyers
I've ever met.

36:22.300 --> 36:24.460
You in particular
should be institutionalized.

36:24.500 --> 36:25.300
Thank you.

36:25.700 --> 36:28.400
Is that yes on the poke?

36:32.200 --> 36:34.500
Denny, I'm sorry about our fight.

36:34.500 --> 36:38.260
It was my fault. I broke our agreement
and got too emotional.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.500
No, no. I'm sorry, too.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.500
For God's sake!

36:42.800 --> 36:45.900
–It was Valerie's doing.
–Jeez, Denny!

36:45.900 --> 36:47.100
Hi, guys.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.400
–Hey.
–Congratulations.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.200
I'm actually happy you won.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.100
I mean, off the record.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.300
–Are you?
–Yeah.

36:55.300 --> 36:58.600
It was fun seeing the both of you again.

36:58.800 --> 37:03.560
And, Alan, Brad and I would love to have
you to the house sometime for dinner.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.600
You're an evil little vixen.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.960
Come on, Alan. Let's go vote.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.366
–You just behave yourself.
–That's Valerie's doing.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.800
Alan Shore.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.100
You hear?

38:36.500 --> 38:37.900
Jerry made partner.

38:37.900 --> 38:38.900
I did.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.360
I also understand
you went to bat for him.

38:41.400 --> 38:44.600
Well, I kinda like the guy,
nut job that he is.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.800
Denny, can you believe…

38:49.000 --> 38:51.860
we could've seriously
hurt ourselves yesterday,

38:51.900 --> 38:53.960
shooting each other
in the face with those things.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.700
–We were really mad.
–Yeah, we were.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.200
I-I-I got the, uh, the mad cow.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.260
What's your excuse?

39:00.300 --> 39:01.600
I don't know.

39:03.800 --> 39:07.628
I've always been such a proponent
of people being able to…

39:08.000 --> 39:10.900
discuss politics
without getting too…

39:11.800 --> 39:13.000
emotional.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.248
There I was, going off like…

39:18.300 --> 39:20.700
It's good that you're passionate.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.500
So we're not gonna…

39:27.600 --> 39:28.800
talk about it?

39:30.900 --> 39:31.800
What?

39:32.600 --> 39:33.900
Who we voted for.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.600
I know who you voted for.

39:37.100 --> 39:38.100
And you?

39:39.800 --> 39:41.300
Finish your drink.

39:42.100 --> 39:45.100
I've already crossed
my aisle today.

39:49.300 --> 39:50.422
What do you mean?

39:53.500 --> 39:54.800
Denny— did you?

39:56.400 --> 39:58.380
I'll never admit it in public.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.960
What made you
change your mind?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.100
Not you.

40:03.700 --> 40:07.000
Ah, truth is, I didn't
know the right choice, but…

40:07.800 --> 40:10.000
these last 8 years…

40:10.900 --> 40:12.200
let's just say,

40:12.200 --> 40:13.600
I knew the wrong one.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.500
I think I love you.

40:16.800 --> 40:17.460
You've always loved me.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.300
I love you more now.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.574
Tomorrow we'll actually wake up
with a…

40:33.800 --> 40:35.700
new president elect.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.700
And possibly…

40:47.400 --> 40:48.700
a new America.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.500
Bigger wow.

40:57.305 --> 41:03.280
