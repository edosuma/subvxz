00:14.348 --> 00:16.600
<i>Part of this is</i>
<i>I'm trying to figure out</i>

00:16.683 --> 00:18.185
<i>some of the big picture things.</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:21.355
<i>How aesthetically to tell your story.</i>

00:21.438 --> 00:25.108
<i>And even before that,</i>
<i>kind of what your story is, you know?</i>

00:26.652 --> 00:28.153
<i>Roll, camera.</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:31.490
<i>I've been thinking about</i>

00:31.573 --> 00:34.910
<i>how we would kind of</i>
<i>create the documentary.</i>

00:36.286 --> 00:40.374
<i>And in my general state of anxiety</i>
<i>right now, I came to this question:</i>

00:40.457 --> 00:43.252
<i>Is this about me, or is this by me?</i>

00:43.335 --> 00:45.462
And you don't even see me drawing, right?

00:46.046 --> 00:49.508
We don't. We're just seeing
the top half of your head.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.134
So you can act with your eyes.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.474
<i>When I design</i>
<i>the experience for the viewer,</i>

00:58.058 --> 01:00.978
<i>of course I want to come across</i>
<i>as good as I possibly can.</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:03.105
<i>'Cause we're vain and we have to be.</i>

01:03.605 --> 01:04.815
<i>And if it's about me,</i>

01:04.898 --> 01:09.736
<i>it's a little bit, just tug of war</i>
<i>of how much do you make me reveal</i>

01:09.820 --> 01:13.824
<i>and how much do I reveal</i>
<i>of stuff that I might not want to reveal.</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:17.494
<i>But, ultimately, it's not about me.</i>

01:19.788 --> 01:21.039
Be an artist.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.042
Be an artist.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.969
<i>I would say everything</i>
<i>that happens between nine and six</i>

02:58.053 --> 02:59.388
<i>is about work.</i>

03:05.060 --> 03:06.853
<i>I work mostly by myself.</i>

03:08.688 --> 03:11.691
<i>So I sit at my desk and I draw</i>
<i>and I design.</i>

03:12.776 --> 03:13.902
<i>So I'm there,</i>

03:13.985 --> 03:17.614
<i>and it's me and my art supplies</i>
<i>and my computer and my coffee maker,</i>

03:17.697 --> 03:20.117
<i>so it's kind of me, me, me.</i>

03:24.121 --> 03:26.957
<i>I'm such a control freak</i>
<i>that I would always love to sit down</i>

03:27.040 --> 03:30.794
<i>and come up with the perfect formula</i>
<i>for creating art.</i>

03:31.711 --> 03:33.422
<i>But it doesn't work that way.</i>

03:35.340 --> 03:37.426
<i>It's a little bit</i>
<i>of a painful realization,</i>

03:37.509 --> 03:41.680
<i>because, ultimately, it really is,</i>
<i>to a very large degree,</i>

03:41.763 --> 03:42.973
<i>staring at paper.</i>

03:44.182 --> 03:50.021
<i>And I have to trust</i>
<i>for kind of crazy moments to happen.</i>

04:06.955 --> 04:13.378
<i>I would say that abstraction probably is,</i>
<i>for me, the most important concept of art.</i>

04:14.796 --> 04:17.591
<i>Where you say,</i>
<i>"Oh, I'm just drawing a simple box,</i>

04:17.674 --> 04:20.427
<i>because I love things</i>
<i>that are not precious."</i>

04:20.886 --> 04:24.556
<i>But it's the idea of, like, I start</i>
<i>with a thousand different thoughts</i>

04:24.639 --> 04:27.184
<i>and then I, one by one,</i>
<i>throw them all out,</i>

04:27.267 --> 04:30.353
<i>until, at the end,</i>
<i>I have the one or two or three</i>

04:30.437 --> 04:32.522
<i>that are essential to the whole question.</i>

04:34.900 --> 04:36.860
<i>But the abstraction, for me,</i>

04:36.943 --> 04:42.407
<i>is this idea of getting rid of everything</i>
<i>that's not essential to making a point.</i>

05:01.426 --> 05:05.263
This thing here, it's called
<i>The Good Shape </i>or <i>The Good Form</i>.

05:05.347 --> 05:09.893
So I take this flatiron shape
and I start doing things out of it.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.311
Men, women,

05:13.730 --> 05:18.819
bathroom, strongman, nuclear power plant,

05:18.902 --> 05:20.320
cowboys and Indians,

05:21.822 --> 05:23.698
all sorts of sports.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.576
So what did your teachers
make of you?

05:26.910 --> 05:30.455
<i>I had a very, very difficult teacher,</i>
<i>Heinz Edelmann,</i>

05:30.539 --> 05:32.999
<i>who did </i>Yellow Submarine,
<i>The Beatles' movie,</i>

05:33.083 --> 05:35.585
<i>and did amazing posters and book work.</i>

05:36.086 --> 05:41.675
Fantastic designer, but let's say
he did not teach by encouragement.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.636
The highest compliment that
you could hope for was,

05:45.011 --> 05:47.639
"Oh, we don't really have
a problem with that."

05:47.722 --> 05:49.182
That was like, "Yes!"

05:51.810 --> 05:55.230
<i>When I grew up in South Western Germany,</i>
<i>I was always drawing.</i>

05:56.731 --> 05:59.818
<i>It was all about getting action</i>
<i>and proportion right.</i>

06:00.318 --> 06:02.612
<i>Drawing things very dynamic.</i>

06:04.614 --> 06:06.157
<i>And that was the goal.</i>

06:06.241 --> 06:10.662
<i>To kind of get there, to this, like,</i>
<i>hyperrealist, amazing painting.</i>

06:10.745 --> 06:14.332
<i>And this is kind of the notion</i>
<i>that I went to art school with.</i>

06:15.625 --> 06:18.628
<i>But the teacher I had at art school,</i>
<i>Mr. Edelmann,</i>

06:18.712 --> 06:22.924
<i>he made it pretty clear that he really</i>
<i>disliked this stuff that I was doing.</i>

06:24.968 --> 06:30.098
So I was drawing hundreds of sketches
on just letter-sized paper,

06:30.181 --> 06:32.809
and each week, he would come in
and go through them

06:32.892 --> 06:36.146
and basically say, "Nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope, nope."

06:36.563 --> 06:37.522
"Oh, this one's okay!"

06:38.690 --> 06:40.400
'Cause this is what we did in school.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.902
Take a topic, like a red clown's nose,

06:42.986 --> 06:45.614
and then just squeeze the hell out of it.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.909
Just do every single variation.

06:52.287 --> 06:57.208
<i>Eventually, I realized that</i>
<i>it's not about something super simple</i>

06:57.292 --> 06:59.544
<i>like a black square or, like, one line.</i>

07:00.045 --> 07:03.465
But each idea requires
a very specific amount of information.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.635
a lot of details,
a lot of realism.

07:06.718 --> 07:10.138
Sometimes it's really just
this one line. The one pixel.

07:10.221 --> 07:14.100
But each idea has one moment
on that scale.

07:14.184 --> 07:18.438
<i>So, lets say you want to illustrate</i>
<i>the idea of a heart as a symbol for love.</i>

07:18.521 --> 07:22.651
When you illustrate it,
as just, like, a red square,

07:22.734 --> 07:25.528
which is the ultimate abstraction
of a heart,

07:25.612 --> 07:28.740
nobody knows what you're talking about,
so it totally falls flat.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.408
When you go all the way realistic

07:30.492 --> 07:35.080
and draw an actual heart made out
of flesh and blood and pumping,

07:35.163 --> 07:36.289
it's just so disgusting

07:36.373 --> 07:39.250
that the last thing anybody
would ever think about is love.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.795
And somewhere between
that abstract red square

07:41.878 --> 07:44.130
and the real, kind of butchered heart,

07:44.214 --> 07:48.385
is the graphic shape that kind of looks
like that, and kind of looks like that,

07:48.468 --> 07:52.764
and it's just right to transport
this idea of a symbol for love.

07:58.770 --> 08:02.399
<i>New Yorker</i> covers are the biggest deal
for an illustrator, I think.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.485
Once you see <i>The New Yorker</i> cover once,

08:05.568 --> 08:08.780
you see the history, you see the artist,

08:08.863 --> 08:12.575
you see, most importantly, I guess,
the cultural impact.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.996
This was my... This was the first one.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.706
What was the date?

08:17.789 --> 08:20.750
July 9, 2001, the day I got married.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.460
Which is especially fantastic.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.257
<i>What I love is that this is</i>
<i>what they put on the magazine.</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:29.509
<i>There's no headline.</i>

08:29.592 --> 08:30.844
<i>There's not even a story.</i>

08:30.927 --> 08:35.265
<i>This was July 4, 2001.</i>
<i>It was about the missile shield.</i>

08:35.348 --> 08:38.560
<i>The Dr. Strangelovian generals</i>
<i>who start World War Three.</i>

08:39.602 --> 08:42.147
There's no story about this idea
inside the magazine.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.608
It's almost like the stage is pulled empty
and this is the image for one week.

08:48.236 --> 08:52.866
The second cover
might actually have been... this one.

08:52.949 --> 08:57.162
And, to a strange degree,
this might even be the most exciting one,

08:57.245 --> 09:00.623
because the first cover of <i>The New Yorker</i>
is the Eustace Tilley,

09:00.707 --> 09:03.168
<i>this New York dandy with a top hat.</i>

09:04.419 --> 09:08.298
<i>And we said,</i>
<i>"Let's try to do an icon of an icon."</i>

09:09.716 --> 09:13.303
<i>Making the butterfly just a blue square,</i>
<i>makes absolutely no sense</i>

09:13.386 --> 09:15.221
<i>unless you know the original.</i>

09:29.277 --> 09:31.279
<i>I've done 22, I think.</i>

09:35.825 --> 09:38.203
<i>The thing is,</i>
<i>I never even thought about 22.</i>

09:39.287 --> 09:41.581
<i>You think that</i>
<i>when you've done two or three,</i>

09:42.665 --> 09:46.002
<i>all of a sudden it becomes, like,</i>
<i>"Oh, it's just another job."</i>

09:46.419 --> 09:52.717
<i>It's not, because it's extremely exciting,</i>
<i>but it never becomes easy.</i>

09:56.679 --> 09:59.682
<i>So tell me about</i>
<i>this </i>New Yorker <i>cover you're working on.</i>

09:59.766 --> 10:02.102
<i>I'm doing this virtual reality cover,</i>

10:02.185 --> 10:04.854
<i>which... It's more like augmented reality.</i>

10:06.439 --> 10:11.986
So the idea is I have this magazine open,
on the front or on the back,

10:12.070 --> 10:15.073
now I approach it
with my phone or with my tablet

10:15.156 --> 10:18.118
and then this whole three-dimensional
animation comes out.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.078
And you're just like, "No way!"

10:20.161 --> 10:25.291
There's a lot of kind of levels
of metaphors and drawing to work.

10:25.375 --> 10:29.045
And 3-D and 2-D and back and forth,
and it's kind of like physical and...

10:31.297 --> 10:32.924
<i>And I also knew I couldn't plan.</i>

10:33.007 --> 10:35.760
<i>I couldn't have one idea</i>
<i>that just solves the entire thing.</i>

10:35.844 --> 10:38.805
<i>I had to start somewhere and then say,</i>
<i>"Okay, is this strong enough</i>

10:38.888 --> 10:41.808
<i>or flexible enough</i>
<i>to just go to the next step?"</i>

10:43.685 --> 10:47.313
So the magazine, in theory,
opened like that.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.692
But I don't look at a magazine like that,

10:50.775 --> 10:53.194
I think nobody ever looks
at a magazine like that.

10:53.278 --> 10:57.323
So I thought, when I have a magazine,
I might look at it like that,

10:57.407 --> 11:00.743
so, really seeing it
as the inside-outside world.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.078
And I was thinking,

11:02.162 --> 11:05.957
"What's... What's like a very
New York inside/outside scene?"

11:10.587 --> 11:12.547
<i>I realized that a subway...</i>

11:13.673 --> 11:16.175
<i>I have the windows,</i>
<i>I have people sitting in there</i>

11:16.259 --> 11:18.303
<i>and then the whole subway can be...</i>

11:19.220 --> 11:22.223
<i>Yeah, that's the idea of the magazine</i>

11:22.307 --> 11:25.852
as the plane
that the person walks through.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.521
You can see it from the inside
or from the outside.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.870
It's a New York City cab, off-duty,

11:45.330 --> 11:46.497
which you can see...

11:49.334 --> 11:50.752
It's off-duty here.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.921
This is... Let's make it busy.

11:53.755 --> 11:54.672
This one's busy.

11:54.756 --> 11:58.134
It looks better, though,
all black and yellow.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.386
My favorite colors.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.389
It's the restriction with Lego,

12:03.473 --> 12:05.058
the restriction of...

12:07.560 --> 12:10.730
just very low resolution...

12:10.813 --> 12:13.650
It's almost like
a three-dimensional pixel drawing...

12:15.234 --> 12:16.527
that I enjoy so much.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.993
Why have you done so much New York work?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.537
Well, it started with my connection.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.791
It was the first city I went to
by myself...

12:29.874 --> 12:33.711
and I think there's only one city
in your life that you go to by yourself...

12:33.795 --> 12:35.046
and you own that.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.049
There was no uncle, there were no parents
that paved the way.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.550
<i>It was like my place.</i>

12:45.974 --> 12:48.267
<i>I moved to New York in '97.</i>

12:51.354 --> 12:53.439
<i>To my surprise, when I went there</i>
<i>and showed my book,</i>

12:54.148 --> 12:58.861
<i>I realized that people understood</i>
<i>99% of my work.</i>

13:00.530 --> 13:03.074
<i>Going to a country</i>
<i>that's a few thousand miles away,</i>

13:03.157 --> 13:06.160
<i>and everybody gets everything</i>
<i>is really amazing.</i>

13:08.162 --> 13:10.415
<i>In a very odd way,</i>
<i>I felt very much at home</i>

13:10.498 --> 13:13.418
<i>just being so immersed in</i>
<i>American culture as a kid.</i>

13:14.877 --> 13:17.672
<i>From music, to art, </i>Magnum P.I.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.830
<i>Staten Island Ferry.</i>

13:50.913 --> 13:54.417
If you've been on the Staten Island Ferry,
you know that this is it.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.755
This is the essence
of this kind of first tourist moment.

14:01.090 --> 14:05.678
<i>For me, this style is based on culture,</i>
<i>on shared experiences.</i>

14:06.637 --> 14:11.267
<i>This is more interesting than coming up</i>
<i>with a visionary new way of speaking</i>

14:11.350 --> 14:14.020
<i>that people then have to decipher.</i>

14:27.617 --> 14:30.995
<i>There's this one Starbucks,</i>
<i>and I love sitting in that window,</i>

14:31.079 --> 14:33.206
<i>and that's been a place</i>
<i>I've been sitting at</i>

14:33.289 --> 14:35.625
<i>from my very first time coming</i>
<i>to New York.</i>

14:35.708 --> 14:39.128
<i>I always felt like, "That's where I want</i>
<i>to sit and kind of look out."</i>

14:39.212 --> 14:42.423
<i>And I've, a couple of times,</i>
<i>tried to work from there,</i>

14:42.507 --> 14:45.510
<i>because that's how I see myself, you know,</i>

14:45.593 --> 14:48.012
<i>like the artist</i>
<i>being in touch with the city...</i>

14:48.805 --> 14:51.766
<i>And then we have</i>
<i>this kind of emotional exchange,</i>

14:51.849 --> 14:52.975
<i>people walking by...</i>

14:55.478 --> 14:56.938
<i>It doesn't work at all.</i>

14:57.897 --> 15:00.691
<i>The impact on the work is zero.</i>

15:00.775 --> 15:04.237
<i>It's even actually confusing,</i>
<i>and I can't really focus when I sit there.</i>

15:05.738 --> 15:07.448
<i>This is the moment where I realized</i>

15:07.532 --> 15:13.162
<i>that kind of, like, my real life</i>
<i>and my work life, they don't really mix.</i>

15:14.914 --> 15:16.249
<i>I see what you're saying.</i>

15:17.083 --> 15:21.796
<i>I'm just trying to kind of solve it</i>
<i>from a visual storytelling point of view.</i>

15:22.255 --> 15:25.049
<i>I mean, I guess, the way</i>
<i>I see some of these things,</i>

15:25.133 --> 15:29.053
<i>it's almost like these very quick montages</i>
<i>of very close shots,</i>

15:29.137 --> 15:30.972
<i>you know, done very quickly.</i>

15:31.055 --> 15:32.598
<i>Just... </i>

15:32.682 --> 15:35.601
<i>Getting through the day,</i>
<i>its ritual, like brushing your teeth.</i>

15:36.185 --> 15:38.146
<i>I mean, again we can try...</i>

15:38.688 --> 15:42.024
<i>You know, like, the idea of a camera</i>
<i>in our bathroom...</i>

15:42.608 --> 15:44.360
<i>makes me feel extremely uncomfortable.</i>

15:45.695 --> 15:47.655
<i>Okay, well I don't want that.</i>

15:47.738 --> 15:50.783
<i>And so we can do it,</i>
<i>but it would be more like a painful thing</i>

15:50.867 --> 15:55.204
<i>and I could not possibly imagine</i>
<i>how I would ever want to see that myself.</i>

15:57.373 --> 15:59.834
<i>I'd much rather draw it than show it.</i>

16:05.381 --> 16:08.092
<i>When I started working,</i>
<i>I worked mostly under deadline.</i>

16:10.928 --> 16:13.473
<i>For the first ten years,</i>

16:14.307 --> 16:17.977
if I would have to separate my business,

16:18.060 --> 16:24.567
it was 30% "We need Christoph
to make a nice drawing on this and that"

16:24.650 --> 16:28.529
and 70% of, like,
"Oh, no, something went terribly wrong.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.449
We have another 12 hours,
let's call that guy,

16:31.532 --> 16:34.368
he will make a somewhat
unembarrassing solution

16:34.452 --> 16:37.246
that will save our butts for deadline."

16:37.788 --> 16:40.541
<i>And I love that.</i>
<i>I love this kind of tension,</i>

16:40.625 --> 16:41.792
<i>especially in editorial,</i>

16:41.876 --> 16:45.379
<i>but a lot of the calls I got</i>
<i>were out of desperation.</i>

17:04.398 --> 17:08.402
<i>So I think Chuck Close said,</i>
<i>"Inspiration is for amateurs.</i>

17:08.903 --> 17:12.031
<i>Us professionals,</i>
<i>we just go to work in the morning."</i>

17:20.039 --> 17:22.667
<i>The one thing</i>
<i>I really love about that quote</i>

17:22.750 --> 17:25.002
<i>is it relieves you of a lot of pressure.</i>

17:25.753 --> 17:29.882
<i>It's not about waiting for hours</i>
<i>for this moment where inspiration strikes.</i>

17:31.050 --> 17:33.803
<i>It's just about showing up</i>
<i>and getting started,</i>

17:33.886 --> 17:37.139
<i>and then something amazing happens</i>
<i>or it doesn't happen.</i>

17:37.223 --> 17:41.018
<i>All that matters is you enable</i>
<i>the chance for something to happen.</i>

17:41.102 --> 17:42.728
For that you have to sit at your desk

17:42.812 --> 17:46.774
and you have to draw and do
and make decisions and hope for the best.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.203
<i>It's so scary when you have</i>
<i>half an hour to do something.</i>

17:59.954 --> 18:01.664
<i>That of course, creating a process</i>

18:01.747 --> 18:04.959
<i>that allows you to do</i>
<i>unembarrassing stuff on command</i>

18:05.042 --> 18:06.711
<i>is the only way you can survive.</i>

18:07.503 --> 18:09.880
<i>If you create an armor</i>
<i>of craft around you.</i>

18:14.218 --> 18:18.097
<i>The one thing that's dangerous</i>
<i>about focusing on craft</i>

18:18.180 --> 18:19.682
<i>and working very hard</i>

18:19.765 --> 18:24.353
<i>is that it can keep you from asking</i>
<i>the really relevant questions.</i>

18:24.437 --> 18:26.188
<i>I'm trying to get good at something,</i>

18:26.272 --> 18:29.734
<i>but is that thing that I'm trying to</i>
<i>get good at the real thing?</i>

18:31.819 --> 18:36.115
It's the subway track
with the knobs on the side of the tracks.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.576
Put...

18:40.828 --> 18:42.204
someone standing there.

18:44.332 --> 18:48.085
So when you stand there
in the middle of the night,

18:48.169 --> 18:49.837
'cause you missed the last G train

18:50.546 --> 18:52.256
and you just look at the critters,

18:53.382 --> 18:55.384
your friends and your enemies at once.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.139
The yellow is the perfect New York color.

19:00.222 --> 19:03.142
It's the taxicabs,
it's the side of the subways....

19:06.020 --> 19:08.147
The contrast is just so perfect.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.620
<i>I met my wonderful wife,</i>

19:22.703 --> 19:24.664
<i>we got married and had kids.</i>

19:26.457 --> 19:30.920
We have this routine of, like, waving
at each other when she leaves and comes.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.591
Have fun.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.678
We're all waiting for you
to leave the frame!

19:39.428 --> 19:41.097
It's totally okay.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.266
See you in a bit.

19:46.477 --> 19:50.981
I guess it started
with me and my wife.

19:51.565 --> 19:56.529
And then we have one kid,
and then it's really more like that.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.948
Then you have a second child.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.741
You think they're like the first one

20:00.825 --> 20:03.411
because you're doing the same thing
you did with the first one,

20:03.494 --> 20:05.413
but the second one
turns out totally different.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.957
But then the third one is more like that.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.312
<i>I did a book</i>

20:30.396 --> 20:33.065
<i>based on the experience</i>
<i>of riding the subway with the kids</i>

20:33.149 --> 20:36.569
and how they just
totally absorbed this idea.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.280
And I think what they liked
about the subway,

20:39.363 --> 20:40.698
what I like about the subway is,

20:40.781 --> 20:43.451
in a strange way,
you're in this huge city,

20:43.534 --> 20:45.536
but it's the one thing
where you're in control.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.265
Sometimes we're like that.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.854
Sometimes like this.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.234
I guess we hope
to be like that more often.

21:18.736 --> 21:22.865
That seems like a realistic rendering
of family life.

21:30.581 --> 21:33.501
I'm trying to come up
with something for <i>The New Yorker.</i>

21:35.419 --> 21:37.505
I'm doing this virtual reality cover,

21:38.380 --> 21:40.800
and basically this is
something I've never done.

21:42.968 --> 21:47.056
<i>In this case, not only do you work 360,</i>
<i>but you work 360 in all directions,</i>

21:47.139 --> 21:49.558
<i>so you can look at it</i>
<i>from all different angles.</i>

21:57.608 --> 22:01.487
<i>For anything decent I've ever done,</i>

22:01.570 --> 22:05.407
<i>I distinctly remember</i>
<i>being in a tense, grumpy mood.</i>

22:09.620 --> 22:13.707
<i>Worse than that, I get suspicious</i>
<i>when having too good of a time working,</i>

22:13.791 --> 22:16.961
<i>since I know that this doesn't bode well</i>
<i>for the outcome.</i>

22:27.846 --> 22:30.432
<i>When you draw in two dimensions,</i>
<i>you can cheat.</i>

22:30.516 --> 22:33.143
<i>You can just hide</i>
<i>anything you don't like behind a wall.</i>

22:33.769 --> 22:36.146
<i>And in this case,</i>
<i>you can look behind the wall</i>

22:36.230 --> 22:38.607
<i>and you can see all the mess</i>
<i>that's behind it.</i>

22:38.691 --> 22:40.985
<i>It's like an endless compromise.</i>

22:42.778 --> 22:47.032
<i>The elements are not this kind of, like,</i>
<i>highly-rendered 3-D world,</i>

22:47.116 --> 22:49.535
<i>which I really detest visually.</i>

22:50.536 --> 22:52.413
<i>You know, where everything has highlights</i>

22:52.496 --> 22:54.999
<i>and everything feels</i>
<i>like this smelly plastic.</i>

22:55.624 --> 22:56.750
<i>I want an ink drawing.</i>

22:56.834 --> 23:01.380
<i>I want, like, a flat ink drawing</i>
<i>that you can walk into</i>

23:01.463 --> 23:03.090
<i>and that kind of surrounds you.</i>

23:05.467 --> 23:07.386
There's too many lines in that side.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.557
Just throw in something
that you think you would regret,

23:11.640 --> 23:13.893
and that's usually
the most interesting part.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.398
When all fails,
just put in some water towers.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.984
It's always a great trick.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.488
And this is so wrong with that dry brush.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.241
I wish I could rip out
the rest of the painting

23:29.325 --> 23:30.451
and do more of that.

23:33.621 --> 23:36.248
Obviously I'm playing around
for the camera now.

23:36.707 --> 23:37.791
Dun, dun, dun...

23:40.252 --> 23:42.713
Okay, next scene.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.302
<i>I'm convinced</i>
<i>you always have to change direction</i>

23:48.385 --> 23:49.595
<i>while things are good.</i>

23:50.929 --> 23:53.849
<i>I was in my mid-30s, was extremely busy.</i>

23:55.476 --> 23:58.354
<i>I felt fulfilled, but exhausted.</i>

24:00.981 --> 24:03.651
<i>And I still think New York</i>
<i>is the best place to work,</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:09.740
<i>but I feel like it's not a good place</i>
<i>to refill your kind of creative tank.</i>

24:13.535 --> 24:16.163
<i>And I find it harder to reinvent.</i>

24:20.167 --> 24:24.213
<i>I sensed that the only way to grow</i>
<i>required that I loosen up.</i>

24:27.257 --> 24:29.677
<i>And it was in the mid-2000s,</i>

24:30.886 --> 24:35.808
<i>my wife and I agreed that the only place</i>
<i>that we could imagine to move to</i>

24:35.891 --> 24:36.934
<i>would be Berlin.</i>

25:33.323 --> 25:36.076
<i>There's all these</i>
<i>kind of crazy galleries</i>

25:36.160 --> 25:39.872
<i>that do stuff that makes absolutely</i>
<i>no sense whatsoever economically</i>

25:39.955 --> 25:42.124
<i>and it's just totally a different mindset.</i>

25:44.877 --> 25:48.630
<i>Berlin makes it easy not to worry so much</i>
<i>about the feasibility of an idea.</i>

25:49.173 --> 25:52.968
<i>So my kind of, like, most intense phase,</i>
<i>in terms of my work,</i>

25:53.051 --> 25:55.262
<i>actually happened when I moved to Berlin.</i>

26:16.408 --> 26:18.744
<i>In a perfect world,</i>
<i>in this documentary,</i>

26:18.827 --> 26:20.913
<i>and this will probably make you queasy,</i>

26:20.996 --> 26:25.751
<i>there would be a moment where</i>
<i>there's a sense of unadulterated reality.</i>

26:25.834 --> 26:27.044
<i>Just a glimpse.</i>

26:28.086 --> 26:29.505
<i>I...</i>

26:30.798 --> 26:34.802
<i>It would feel so completely out of place.</i>

26:34.885 --> 26:38.972
<i>Like, it would be the farthest thing</i>
<i>from me ever showing anybody</i>

26:39.056 --> 26:40.390
<i>how I brush my teeth.</i>

26:41.058 --> 26:43.811
<i>When you show the real thing, you kill it.</i>

26:44.311 --> 26:47.731
You make it impossible to then look
at these things in the abstract.

26:47.815 --> 26:53.362
It's like in... I think in Charlie Brown,
you never see the grown-ups,

26:53.445 --> 26:55.864
you only hear these muffled voices,

26:55.948 --> 26:57.699
and that's perfect, that's amazing!

26:57.783 --> 27:00.410
The one moment you zoom out
and show these grownups,

27:00.494 --> 27:03.747
they could be designed perfectly,
they could be written perfectly,

27:03.831 --> 27:05.874
but everything else
would be crashing down.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.628
So, in a way, I feel like
we already zoomed out and showed,

27:09.711 --> 27:11.630
even though I don't know
if I'm a grown-up,

27:11.713 --> 27:15.008
but that's already far too big
of a zoom out.

27:15.092 --> 27:17.427
And if you go even further there...

27:17.928 --> 27:23.350
So much of your daily routine
and life inspires your work.

27:23.433 --> 27:26.103
It just seems
like we should be able to see it.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.024
Well, yeah. I guess. Yeah.

27:33.569 --> 27:36.446
<i>Okay, honestly nobody wants authenticity.</i>

27:36.530 --> 27:39.032
Authenticity is like changing
your kid's diapers.

27:39.116 --> 27:43.203
It's a cute idea in the abstract,
but the real deal is just...

27:44.413 --> 27:46.707
<i>All I care about</i>
<i>is what's happening on the page,</i>

27:46.790 --> 27:50.669
<i>because I want people</i>
<i>to really think about themselves.</i>

27:52.921 --> 27:55.257
<i>What went into creating the art?</i>

27:55.340 --> 27:58.552
But people want to see you
in your real life.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.680
We can't just film you
at your desk the whole documentary.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.108
<i>Anything that's happening</i>
<i>between nine and six</i>

28:13.192 --> 28:14.568
<i>is kind of the essence.</i>

28:16.737 --> 28:19.323
<i>But some stuff has to happen</i>
<i>outside the studio.</i>

28:20.324 --> 28:22.159
<i>Like going to a museum.</i>

28:27.539 --> 28:31.960
<i>The gateway drug is not creating art,</i>
<i>but experiencing art.</i>

28:47.601 --> 28:49.728
<i>Having the whole world explained,</i>

28:49.811 --> 28:52.189
<i>or even better, turned upside down,</i>

28:52.272 --> 28:56.443
<i>just by looking at</i>
<i>a few strokes of oil paint on canvas.</i>

29:00.322 --> 29:02.366
<i>That's the greatest thrill I know.</i>

29:09.873 --> 29:12.042
<i>If experiencing art is so amazing,</i>

29:12.125 --> 29:14.628
<i>how great must it be</i>
<i>to actually make this stuff?</i>

29:16.213 --> 29:18.382
<i>And that's how they lure you</i>
<i>into art school.</i>

29:34.815 --> 29:37.818
<i> Everything I do</i>
<i>is kind of creating information,</i>

29:37.901 --> 29:42.823
<i>creating usually images that do something</i>
<i>with what the viewer already knows.</i>

29:42.906 --> 29:47.911
<i>Really the idea of, like, their experience</i>
<i>and my experience coming together</i>

29:47.995 --> 29:50.247
<i>and the images are the trigger.</i>

29:53.834 --> 29:59.172
<i>But the big, big problem with routine</i>
<i>is everything starts to look the same.</i>

29:59.965 --> 30:04.970
<i>So I'm constantly trying to reinvent</i>
<i>how I approach image making,</i>

30:05.053 --> 30:06.888
<i>how I approach storytelling,</i>

30:06.972 --> 30:10.183
<i>because the audience changes all the time,</i>
<i>I change all the time.</i>

30:17.607 --> 30:20.319
<i> When I was 12,</i>
<i>I taught myself to juggle.</i>

30:21.653 --> 30:24.573
<i>At any given moment,</i>
<i>there's one ball in the air.</i>

30:24.656 --> 30:28.285
<i>And this is something that I hate so much,</i>
<i>this idea of no control.</i>

30:29.786 --> 30:33.707
<i>But this approach of not planning</i>
<i>opens a new door.</i>

30:36.501 --> 30:41.882
<i>It's really, really hard,</i>
<i>but it just leads to these magic moments.</i>

31:02.694 --> 31:05.447
<i>I started an Instagram project</i>
<i>called </i>Sunday Sketches.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.408
<i>In terms of the response I've got,</i>

31:08.492 --> 31:11.328
<i>they've been some of the better stuff</i>
<i>I've been doing,</i>

31:11.411 --> 31:14.831
<i>but on the other hand, they're</i>
<i>the most useless things I've ever done.</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:21.380
<i>There's almost zero control there.</i>

31:23.632 --> 31:25.675
<i>For my professional work, I need control</i>

31:25.759 --> 31:29.054
<i>because I need to be able to tweak,</i>
<i>to adjust, to plan.</i>

31:34.184 --> 31:36.645
<i>But these </i>Sunday Sketches
<i>are un-plannable.</i>

31:38.230 --> 31:42.401
<i>All the good ones just happen</i>
<i>by me just staring at something.</i>

31:43.985 --> 31:46.405
<i>Like moving around the light,</i>
<i>and all of a sudden,</i>

31:46.488 --> 31:50.534
<i>there's a highlight or a shadow and then,</i>
<i>"Oh, now there's something happening."</i>

31:51.785 --> 31:53.203
<i>You can't sketch that.</i>

32:03.630 --> 32:04.673
<i>I never was a reader</i>

32:04.756 --> 32:06.508
<i>because I never want</i>
<i>to escape from anything,</i>

32:06.591 --> 32:08.844
<i>I want my real life to be interesting.</i>

32:10.095 --> 32:11.805
<i>But then I read a book,</i>

32:11.888 --> 32:14.975
The Invention of Slowness,
<i>I think is the title.</i>

32:17.853 --> 32:21.815
<i>It's about a guy who is</i>
<i>so incredibly slow in his perception</i>

32:21.898 --> 32:25.193
<i>that he can...</i>
<i>He actually sees shadows moving.</i>

32:28.780 --> 32:30.073
<i>It's a good fiction book,</i>

32:30.157 --> 32:32.951
<i>but the amazing thing</i>
<i>that I remember from reading that book</i>

32:33.034 --> 32:35.287
<i>is, whenever I looked up from that book,</i>

32:38.790 --> 32:42.752
<i>I felt I had this view from the book</i>
<i>in my real world.</i>

32:53.889 --> 32:56.433
<i>This book made my life more interesting.</i>

33:02.105 --> 33:03.398
<i>This is also in art,</i>

33:03.482 --> 33:06.818
<i>something where you're not creating</i>
<i>an artificial world.</i>

33:09.070 --> 33:12.115
<i>You're taking the things you know,</i>

33:12.991 --> 33:15.785
<i>and then you break them down</i>
<i>into little elements.</i>

33:17.996 --> 33:19.456
<i>And I rearrange them,</i>

33:21.750 --> 33:23.585
<i>and all of a sudden make a statement.</i>

33:25.545 --> 33:28.673
<i> Not with a monster</i>
<i>or a dragon,</i>

33:29.341 --> 33:30.342
<i>but with a pencil.</i>

33:40.435 --> 33:42.354
<i>I came from, you know, print media.</i>

33:43.188 --> 33:45.565
<i>You just felt like it's always</i>
<i>going to be there,</i>

33:45.649 --> 33:48.235
<i>people always need images</i>
<i>and they always need to be drawn,</i>

33:48.318 --> 33:50.445
<i>and if you've figured it out, you're set.</i>

33:51.947 --> 33:54.032
<i>And all of a sudden, it wasn't anymore.</i>

33:54.783 --> 33:58.578
<i>It was about web long form pieces,</i>
<i>it was about animation.</i>

34:00.038 --> 34:03.875
<i>Of course, it's our job to see</i>
<i>if there's some relevant way</i>

34:03.959 --> 34:06.211
<i>that I can contribute to this new angle.</i>

34:08.046 --> 34:11.466
So this is all of us, all the time.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.138
So this is an app I did
over the last four years,

34:17.222 --> 34:20.016
and I wanted
to do something interactive...

34:20.684 --> 34:21.768
But the big question is

34:21.851 --> 34:27.148
the moment I give too much decision-making
to the viewer over what can happen...

34:28.191 --> 34:30.068
Often, the viewer
might have different ideas,

34:30.151 --> 34:31.403
and you want to be surprised.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.029
That's the whole point of books.

34:33.113 --> 34:36.366
You want some surprise.
You want something unexpected to happen.

34:43.999 --> 34:50.630
But here, in my literary section,
I have all these literature references,

34:50.714 --> 34:52.966
like Don Quixote and Kafka,

34:55.385 --> 34:56.511
Moby Dick,

34:57.596 --> 34:58.972
a little Jane Austen,

34:59.431 --> 35:00.265
and Homer,

35:00.348 --> 35:03.476
and hopefully kids enjoy that scene
as much as grown-ups.

35:11.026 --> 35:11.860
<i>Some people love it,</i>

35:14.446 --> 35:16.031
and probably some people don't.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.199
Some people love it,

35:19.534 --> 35:20.869
some people don't.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.037
That's life.

35:36.468 --> 35:41.890
<i>I'm wondering, it almost seems</i>
<i>like, you know, the creator of your pieces</i>

35:41.973 --> 35:44.017
<i>and you, as editor of your pieces,</i>

35:44.100 --> 35:46.686
<i>are two different people.</i>

35:46.770 --> 35:47.771
<i>Yes!</i>

35:51.941 --> 35:55.320
<i>I need to be in control</i>
<i>and I need to have a very clear sense</i>

35:55.403 --> 35:58.490
<i>of where I'm going and why</i>
<i>something's working and not working.</i>

36:01.117 --> 36:05.955
<i>On the other hand, I've also realized that</i>
<i>being more free-spirited is necessary.</i>

36:11.086 --> 36:14.798
<i>I've found that I need to develop</i>
<i>these two personas separately.</i>

36:15.465 --> 36:20.679
<i>Be a much more ruthless editor</i>
<i>and be a much more careless artist.</i>

36:28.103 --> 36:33.233
<i>This I find physically exhausting,</i>
<i>but there's good stuff happening there.</i>

36:48.665 --> 36:53.461
<i>I take very specific time off</i>
<i>for this kind of, like, free creation.</i>

36:55.714 --> 36:58.842
<i>Because I know it's basically impossible</i>
<i>to do under deadline.</i>

37:02.303 --> 37:04.848
<i>Literally, just sitting</i>
<i>in front of a piece of paper</i>

37:04.931 --> 37:08.268
<i>and just doing stuff and being fearless.</i>

37:11.062 --> 37:15.233
<i>There's something there that I need to,</i>
<i>kind of, go back and investigate further.</i>

37:20.280 --> 37:23.992
<i>Creatively,</i>
<i>I'm extremely dependent on these sparks.</i>

37:26.953 --> 37:30.999
<i>And it only works with loosening up,</i>
<i>without an assignment, without deadline,</i>

37:31.082 --> 37:32.876
<i>with just kind of creating</i>

37:32.959 --> 37:36.546
<i>and not worrying so much</i>
<i>about where the whole thing goes.</i>

37:39.758 --> 37:42.343
<i>But I think it has never happened to me</i>

37:42.427 --> 37:45.221
<i>that I tried something new</i>
<i>on a big deadline.</i>

37:46.473 --> 37:49.184
<i>And what's your deadline</i>
<i>for </i>The New Yorker<i>?</i>

37:49.267 --> 37:50.351
<i>Two weeks.</i>

37:50.435 --> 37:54.272
<i>It's going to be insanity.</i>
<i>Totally stressed out.</i>

37:58.693 --> 38:00.695
<i>I've seen a lot of VR stuff,</i>

38:00.779 --> 38:03.656
<i>and it's always, like,</i>
<i>"Oh, wow! This is so interesting,"</i>

38:04.616 --> 38:08.411
<i>and then, 25 seconds later,</i>
<i>I completely lose interest</i>

38:08.495 --> 38:10.789
<i>and this is the great challenge right now.</i>

38:14.459 --> 38:18.505
<i>This is not, like, a coy thing to say,</i>
<i>"Oh, I don't believe I'm talented."</i>

38:18.588 --> 38:22.967
<i>This is real,</i>
<i>like, being absolutely painfully aware</i>

38:23.051 --> 38:26.679
<i>of how you're not good enough</i>
<i>to do something on command.</i>

38:35.438 --> 38:38.107
<i>Your general notion</i>
<i>is that doing something nice</i>

38:38.191 --> 38:39.818
<i>makes you more confident.</i>

38:40.568 --> 38:43.238
<i>With ideas,</i>
<i>I often find it's the opposite.</i>

38:44.113 --> 38:47.575
<i>With every good idea you have,</i>
<i>it actually becomes more difficult,</i>

38:47.659 --> 38:49.911
<i>because it's so hard to then repeat.</i>

38:49.994 --> 38:51.371
<i>Of course, you can't repeat.</i>

38:55.917 --> 38:57.627
<i>This is, like, where the pain comes in,</i>

38:57.710 --> 39:01.840
<i>when I talk about not being good enough,</i>
<i>or being afraid that you're out of ideas.</i>

39:04.717 --> 39:07.512
<i>You measure yourself</i>
<i>against a lucky moment.</i>

39:09.138 --> 39:11.266
<i>And this is, like, really, really painful.</i>

39:13.142 --> 39:15.603
<i>You had this one kind of spark</i>
<i>three years ago,</i>

39:15.687 --> 39:17.689
<i>and then a client asks you to do it again.</i>

39:19.148 --> 39:20.692
<i>And you think, "How can I?</i>

39:20.775 --> 39:21.901
<i>I won the lottery then.</i>

39:21.985 --> 39:25.947
<i>How can you ask me to win the lottery,</i>
<i>under pressure, with a gun to my head?"</i>

39:26.030 --> 39:29.868
<i>And this is something that,</i>
<i>before I consciously thought about it,</i>

39:29.951 --> 39:32.203
<i>I just realized, "Oh, God, I'm miserable."</i>

39:40.461 --> 39:41.963
<i> But when I realized</i>

39:42.046 --> 39:46.342
<i>that my fears threatened</i>
<i>to take a toll on my work,</i>

39:47.010 --> 39:49.178
<i>I decided I had to deal with them.</i>

39:51.764 --> 39:54.434
<i>Relax; don't be so hard on yourself.</i>

39:55.268 --> 39:56.936
<i>I actually totally disagree.</i>

39:58.396 --> 40:00.398
<i>You have to practice and become better.</i>

40:01.274 --> 40:05.028
<i>Every athlete, every musician</i>
<i>practices every day.</i>

40:06.029 --> 40:07.655
<i>Why should it be different for artists?</i>

40:31.137 --> 40:33.598
<i>I sometimes imagine</i>
<i>what would happen</i>

40:33.681 --> 40:37.936
<i>if I had to face</i>
<i>the 2006 version of myself</i>

40:38.019 --> 40:40.897
<i>in some sort of creative bar fight.</i>

40:41.940 --> 40:44.901
<i>Maybe I've lost some of my youthful spark,</i>

40:45.443 --> 40:47.654
<i>but I'm confident I would kick my butt.</i>

40:54.994 --> 40:58.414
<i>The assignment was</i>
<i>to do an augmented reality cover.</i>

40:59.332 --> 41:01.793
In a way,
we have that augmented reality cover,

41:01.876 --> 41:04.295
but this already is
an augmented reality cover,

41:04.379 --> 41:08.007
because you can look at the same scene
from two sides.

41:08.091 --> 41:09.175
I'm inside the subway.

41:09.258 --> 41:13.388
So, essentially what I do with the iPad,
I do with the physical magazine.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.849
As if the magazine is
the door of the subway.

41:16.933 --> 41:20.520
So this is an extension of that,
rather than the other way round.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.987
Yeah, yeah.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.617
<i>I know how complex it is</i>
<i>to put these different things,</i>

41:34.701 --> 41:36.494
<i>like the 3-D and the animation together,</i>

41:36.577 --> 41:41.624
that I'm surprised
how close it came to what I imagined.

42:54.906 --> 42:58.576
<i>The idea of pop music is not</i>
<i>to invent a new story,</i>

42:58.659 --> 43:03.039
<i>but to tell the same story again</i>
<i>in a new and interesting way.</i>

43:04.791 --> 43:06.417
<i>We don't buy new pop songs and say,</i>

43:06.501 --> 43:10.671
<i>"Oh, there's somebody singing about love,</i>
<i>nobody else has dared do that until now."</i>

43:12.173 --> 43:15.093
<i>People have been singing about love</i>
<i>for 500 years.</i>

43:19.055 --> 43:21.474
<i>And it's the idea of, like,</i>
<i>making it different,</i>

43:21.557 --> 43:24.435
<i>that you feel,</i>
<i>"Oh, I never actually until now,</i>

43:25.686 --> 43:27.897
<i>nobody has ever gotten it right."</i>

43:38.407 --> 43:41.869
<i>I love the idea of bringing</i>
<i>these familiar scenes back in,</i>

43:42.870 --> 43:45.581
<i>but just making them</i>
<i>appear to be totally different.</i>

43:45.665 --> 43:46.999
<i>New and true.</i>

44:05.476 --> 44:06.936
<i>In the best moments,</i>

44:07.019 --> 44:10.106
<i>what happens</i>
<i>is that design celebrates the world.</i>

44:14.986 --> 44:18.239
<i>When I look at a piece of art</i>
<i>that references my fears,</i>

44:18.322 --> 44:19.949
<i>my anxieties, my hopes,</i>

44:21.242 --> 44:26.497
<i>and I can say, "There was this one drawing</i>
<i>that made me realize that I'm alive</i>

44:26.581 --> 44:29.167
<i>or that I love other people</i>
<i>or that I'm afraid."</i>

45:02.658 --> 45:05.536
<i>My goal is to speak visuals...</i>

45:06.078 --> 45:08.456
<i>like a pianist speaks piano.</i>

45:09.415 --> 45:11.250
<i>And like somebody controls the keys</i>

45:11.334 --> 45:13.961
<i>and can convey different ideas,</i>
<i>different emotions,</i>

45:14.045 --> 45:15.504
<i>through that language.</i>

45:22.053 --> 45:28.059
<i>I have to constantly battle to try to</i>
<i>kind of refine the act of speaking.</i>

45:30.937 --> 45:34.315
<i>Taking the world and putting it</i>
<i>into images and conveying them.</i>

45:36.317 --> 45:38.653
<i>And for that,</i>
<i>I have to constantly produce.</i>

45:39.528 --> 45:42.281
<i>It's not done,</i>
<i>because the whole idea of being done</i>

45:42.365 --> 45:45.243
<i>is kind of the opposite</i>
<i>of what I'm trying to achieve.</i>

45:46.744 --> 45:48.287
<i>Gute Nacht.</i>
