02:41.638 --> 02:43.261
I asked you here today to acknowledge

02:43.261 --> 02:46.065
the exceptional work you've done.

02:46.065 --> 02:49.736
We could not have
come this far without you.

02:49.736 --> 02:53.491
Now tonight
at the 40 mile Celebration,

02:53.491 --> 02:56.381
we shall have the pleasure
of entertaining senators,

02:56.381 --> 03:00.321
investors and sundry
other dignitaries.

03:00.321 --> 03:04.160
And since we are in such short supply

03:04.160 --> 03:07.232
of, uh, ladies of repute,

03:07.232 --> 03:11.205
you will all be invited to the dance.

03:11.205 --> 03:12.941
Oh!
All right.

03:12.941 --> 03:16.988
But you will have to make
yourselves presentable

03:16.988 --> 03:21.537
and behave like the proper
ladies I know you can...

03:21.537 --> 03:24.167
Pretend to be,

03:24.167 --> 03:26.462
but I warn you, pick pockets,

03:26.462 --> 03:30.969
Blushingtons, bug hunters
will be severely dealt with.

03:30.969 --> 03:35.435
Now, go clean yourselves up.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.108
Boys.

03:39.108 --> 03:42.571
How we doing?

03:42.571 --> 03:45.186
Getting ready for the dance.
Oh.

03:45.186 --> 03:49.290
Listen. Y'all been tailing
Swede like I told you?

03:49.290 --> 03:53.047
We have. But to no avail.

03:53.047 --> 03:54.508
He's a slippery bastard, that one.

03:54.508 --> 03:56.803
He rode out of town last night.

03:56.803 --> 03:58.347
You know where he went?

03:58.347 --> 03:59.098
No.

04:00.134 --> 04:03.689
Uh... well, he bought
two bottles of whisky

04:03.689 --> 04:05.275
at the starlight before he left.

04:05.275 --> 04:06.861
Must be going on a bender.

04:06.861 --> 04:09.949
Swede don't drink.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.957
Then I guess he's
meeting someone who does.

04:21.733 --> 04:25.141
I wasn't there that night.

04:27.076 --> 04:29.314
Check the date on my discharge.

04:29.314 --> 04:33.060
I was wounded at Starkville
two weeks before Meridian.

04:33.060 --> 04:36.331
Then how could you know
what happened that night?

04:36.331 --> 04:39.247
I stayed in touch with Johnson
and the boys after the war.

04:39.247 --> 04:41.137
They told me all about it.

04:41.137 --> 04:45.758
And you can still testify
as to why Bohannan had motive

04:45.758 --> 04:49.555
to kill Johnson and this other man?

04:49.555 --> 04:52.227
You think I'm crazy?
He already tried to kill me once.

04:52.227 --> 04:53.812
I'll finish the job
if I go back there.

04:53.812 --> 04:57.761
This man, he's not going to give up.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.038
he just going to show
up on your doorstep

05:04.038 --> 05:06.040
and kill you dead.

05:07.835 --> 05:09.112
Now.

05:09.112 --> 05:12.885
Let's finish this thing, huh?

05:12.885 --> 05:13.885
Hmm?

05:15.414 --> 05:16.415
Now.

05:19.655 --> 05:20.656
Hey.

05:21.758 --> 05:24.770
That whisky goes to Dan's town.

05:24.770 --> 05:26.072
Yes, sir.

05:26.072 --> 05:28.533
Not in your town.

05:29.902 --> 05:31.513
I'm going to check 'em later,

05:31.513 --> 05:34.608
make sure they ain't light
one or two bottles.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.927
Damn it all!

05:43.392 --> 05:45.289
Right.

05:48.028 --> 05:51.709
You having trouble
with your floorboards, ma'am?

05:51.709 --> 05:54.202
Well, you're very
perceptive, aren't you?

05:57.248 --> 06:01.047
I'm afraid I'm not
much of a carpenter.

06:02.673 --> 06:06.220
No, ma'am, you ain't.

06:08.809 --> 06:11.731
Could you possibly help me?

06:11.731 --> 06:16.614
That is, if you're not
busy killing anyone.

06:18.071 --> 06:22.206
Well, sure as heck
can't do any worse.

06:22.206 --> 06:22.927
Great.

06:44.647 --> 06:48.217
You're quite handy
with a hammer and nail.

06:49.499 --> 06:53.734
Were you really
a farmer before the war?

06:53.734 --> 06:55.677
Is that so hard to believe?

06:55.677 --> 06:58.223
Yes, actually.

06:58.223 --> 07:03.014
I find it hard to imagine
you in a domestic setting.

07:03.014 --> 07:05.818
I couldn't, either.
I always had one eye on the door.

07:05.818 --> 07:07.739
So you were married.

07:07.739 --> 07:08.739
Was.

07:09.882 --> 07:11.327
Had a son, too.

07:11.327 --> 07:15.501
War come along and...
Jumped at the chance.

07:15.501 --> 07:19.272
Mary didn't want me to go, but, ahh.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.246
She didn't stand in my way, either.

07:23.246 --> 07:27.210
Now I'd give anything
to be home and just...

07:30.586 --> 07:34.300
So you lost them both?

07:34.300 --> 07:37.463
Your wife and your son.

07:39.748 --> 07:42.419
I'm so sorry.

07:44.142 --> 07:46.426
It's all right.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.319
That about does it here.
Wait. Please, I'm sorry.

07:57.319 --> 08:01.070
I didn't mean to upset you.
Please, don't...

08:13.357 --> 08:16.971
Whatever happened
to your wife and son,

08:16.971 --> 08:22.202
please don't let it
kill the man they loved.

08:25.342 --> 08:28.369
Sorry, Mrs. Bell.

08:30.284 --> 08:33.962
It's too late for that.

08:47.066 --> 08:50.071
Mr. Durant.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.463
I thought you'd be
well on your way by now.

08:52.463 --> 08:54.267
Decided to stay.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.504
Is that wise?

08:56.504 --> 08:59.044
I ain't never been accused
of being wise, sir.

08:59.044 --> 09:02.634
So we'll see you
at the dance tonight?

09:02.634 --> 09:06.389
You will if I'm there.

09:08.767 --> 09:11.261
Special ordered from New York.

09:11.261 --> 09:13.025
Oh, Thomas.

09:13.025 --> 09:14.500
I cannot accept this.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.536
Oh, it's not a gift.

09:16.536 --> 09:19.775
Think of it as payment.

09:19.775 --> 09:22.290
For what?

09:22.290 --> 09:25.285
I've invited many potential investors

09:25.285 --> 09:27.131
to the celebration this evening.

09:27.131 --> 09:30.303
What does that have to do with me?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.998
It's become clear to me
that this railroad

09:32.998 --> 09:35.034
could do with a face
other than my own

09:35.034 --> 09:37.691
associated with it.

09:37.691 --> 09:41.989
You're thinking of
the fair-haired maiden of the west.

09:41.989 --> 09:43.180
Yes.

09:43.180 --> 09:45.369
You think she'll lure the investors.

09:45.369 --> 09:48.834
Like moths to a flame, my dear.

09:48.834 --> 09:51.893
I'll consider it.

09:51.893 --> 09:54.634
On one condition.

09:57.494 --> 10:01.276
Why is nothing ever
elemental with you?

10:01.276 --> 10:03.357
I want to be a part of it.

10:04.975 --> 10:06.571
Part of what?

10:06.571 --> 10:07.922
The building of this road.

10:07.922 --> 10:09.725
I want to see it through to the end.

10:09.725 --> 10:11.746
Do we have a deal?

10:11.746 --> 10:15.293
Your condition is accepted, madame.

10:30.586 --> 10:31.306
Sorry.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.445
Uh... ahem.

11:08.754 --> 11:11.509
I don't... I don't mean to
disturb your prayers, preach.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.641
How can I help you, son?

11:20.966 --> 11:21.807
Well...

11:23.403 --> 11:27.642
I'm on a dark path, sir.

11:30.380 --> 11:33.660
Been on it for a while now.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.008
Where does the dark path lead?

11:38.552 --> 11:41.071
More blood.

11:41.071 --> 11:42.560
More hatred.

11:47.372 --> 11:49.250
I met somebody who reached out to me

11:49.250 --> 11:52.492
and asked me to turn
away from the darkness.

11:55.853 --> 11:58.920
Been wanting to preach to me,

11:58.920 --> 12:00.302
so...

12:00.302 --> 12:01.253
Here's your chance.

12:11.747 --> 12:12.748
Ahh.

12:20.026 --> 12:22.306
Well, there's a God.

12:22.306 --> 12:26.012
That I have no doubt.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.263
Um...

12:29.510 --> 12:32.588
But there's a...

12:32.588 --> 12:35.354
There's a devil, too.

12:35.354 --> 12:38.966
And you know...
You know what that old...

12:38.966 --> 12:41.470
That old devil did?

12:41.470 --> 12:44.474
You want me to tell you about that?

12:44.474 --> 12:45.724
Yeah?

12:52.945 --> 12:55.512
Well, that devil, he, uh,

12:55.512 --> 12:59.963
he cut off God's arms.

12:59.963 --> 13:02.668
And he hacked off God's legs.

13:02.668 --> 13:06.070
And he gouged out his eyes.

13:06.070 --> 13:08.577
Ripped out his tongue
and left him lying there

13:08.577 --> 13:10.578
in a bloody heap on the floor.

13:10.578 --> 13:13.875
But he left God's ears

13:13.875 --> 13:16.086
so he could hear us down here

13:16.086 --> 13:18.227
when we're wailing and thrashing

13:18.227 --> 13:21.699
and praying for his help.

13:21.699 --> 13:24.517
But, Brother...

13:24.517 --> 13:28.068
There ain't a damn thing
God can do to help us.

13:30.072 --> 13:32.447
What are you saying, preacher?

13:33.645 --> 13:37.161
Just choose hate.

13:37.161 --> 13:40.155
It's so much easier.

13:52.553 --> 13:53.555
Brother!

13:56.193 --> 13:58.906
Choose hate.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.244
I thought everybody was
supposed to have the day off.

14:27.244 --> 14:29.462
Everybody but us.

14:29.462 --> 14:31.125
We had no say in it, neither.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.836
Want me to talk to Durant about it?

14:32.836 --> 14:36.718
You sittin' in some mighty high cotton,
ain't you, boy?

14:36.718 --> 14:37.875
Watch yourself, son.

14:37.875 --> 14:40.056
I'm still your boss.

14:40.056 --> 14:43.479
Who do you think you is in
these fancy clothes, huh?

14:43.479 --> 14:45.148
Who cocked your hat, boy?

14:45.148 --> 14:47.558
You did.

14:47.558 --> 14:50.866
Ain't supposed to be our boss, hmm?

14:50.866 --> 14:53.133
You're supposed to be our leader.

14:53.133 --> 14:56.405
Thinking you're looking out for us.

14:56.405 --> 14:59.254
Turns out you're just looking
out for your own damn self.

14:59.254 --> 15:00.924
Ain't nobody else going to do it.

15:02.884 --> 15:04.051
I ain't your master.

15:04.051 --> 15:07.684
You need to look out
for your own self, huh?

15:39.067 --> 15:40.446
Carlton.

15:44.676 --> 15:46.707
Mr. Bohannan.

15:46.707 --> 15:49.527
Been looking everywhere for you.

15:49.527 --> 15:51.881
What's going on, Sean?

15:51.881 --> 15:54.233
I'm just making plans for the Swede.

15:54.233 --> 15:56.180
He's just rolled back in.

15:56.180 --> 15:57.907
And I don't think he's alone.

15:57.907 --> 16:01.012
Oh, yeah?
Who's he with?

16:01.012 --> 16:02.899
Well, I didn't hear any names,

16:02.899 --> 16:09.082
but he had on a union jacket
with Sergeant Stripes.

16:14.425 --> 16:16.504
Sergeant's jacket, huh?

16:16.504 --> 16:20.345
Yeah, I think so.
I know we've had our differences...

16:20.345 --> 16:23.642
- Are you sure you saw Sergeant Stripes?
- Yes!

16:26.344 --> 16:28.107
Where they at?

16:30.068 --> 16:31.488
Where they at?

16:33.281 --> 16:35.369
Where they at?

16:35.369 --> 16:36.871
Swede's caboose.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.798
Will this make us even for the fight?

16:48.111 --> 16:49.266
Bohannan.

17:02.997 --> 17:06.752
A couple of federal marshals
are coming to arrest me tonight.

17:06.752 --> 17:08.517
For what?

17:08.517 --> 17:10.092
Murder.

17:10.092 --> 17:12.137
So why haven't you just up and left?

17:12.137 --> 17:14.013
Sergeant's here.

17:14.013 --> 17:16.477
Swede tracked him down.

17:16.477 --> 17:18.646
I reckon he talked him
into testifying against me.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.734
How you know Harper will be
the man you're looking for?

17:20.734 --> 17:22.695
He has to be.
You don't know that.

17:23.432 --> 17:25.492
The hell is your stake in all this?

17:25.492 --> 17:27.871
I ain't got none.

17:27.871 --> 17:30.208
Why do you even care?

17:33.550 --> 17:35.175
You told me something once.

17:35.420 --> 17:38.053
It was the only thing
that ever set me free.

17:38.053 --> 17:40.266
Yeah. What's that?

17:40.266 --> 17:43.438
You got to let go of the past.

18:02.934 --> 18:05.724
You will be the king of the ball.

18:07.474 --> 18:10.941
Unfortunately with
no queen by my side.

18:10.941 --> 18:13.570
Are you referring to Mrs. Lily Bell?

18:13.570 --> 18:14.829
Hmm.

18:14.829 --> 18:18.492
Sir, shall we take a walk?
Hmm?

18:23.702 --> 18:26.316
Mr. Gunderson, have you ever had

18:26.316 --> 18:29.278
your heart ripped out by a woman?

18:29.846 --> 18:31.392
I was married once, sir,

18:31.392 --> 18:33.695
but she ran off with a gypsy.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.733
My heart was not ripped out,

18:35.733 --> 18:39.696
but she did steal my cuckoo clock.

18:42.036 --> 18:46.551
Well, my gypsy is Bohannan.

18:46.551 --> 18:48.689
Ahh. Loki, yeah.

18:48.689 --> 18:50.391
What?

18:50.391 --> 18:53.092
So he and Mrs. Lily Bell.

18:55.191 --> 18:57.669
I gave him a chance to run,

18:57.669 --> 18:59.436
but he wouldn't take it.

18:59.436 --> 19:02.734
Run? But why?

19:02.734 --> 19:07.418
Mr. Gunderson,
I told him about the federal marshals.

19:07.418 --> 19:09.411
He knows you're up to something.

19:09.411 --> 19:10.411
Ohh.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.662
Why did you tell him?

19:13.662 --> 19:16.066
I wanted to get rid of him.

19:16.066 --> 19:18.300
The fool wouldn't leave.

19:18.300 --> 19:21.555
Why are you telling me this now?

19:21.555 --> 19:26.647
Because I want you to succeed
in your plan, Mr. Gunderson.

19:39.463 --> 19:42.882
You need to get out of here.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.343
Now.
Why?

19:46.073 --> 19:47.222
He's coming.

19:50.279 --> 19:51.896
Find a place to hide.
Where?

19:51.896 --> 19:53.358
I don't want to know.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.561
Why not?

19:54.561 --> 19:55.903
So Bohannan can't get it out of me.

19:56.155 --> 19:57.832
Now listen, no matter what,

19:57.832 --> 20:00.703
you must meet that train
when it arrive.

20:00.703 --> 20:02.622
The marshals will protect you.

20:14.984 --> 20:16.896
Where is he?

20:16.896 --> 20:19.817
Where is who?

20:25.737 --> 20:27.830
In the myths of my homeland

20:27.830 --> 20:31.544
there is a God that go
by the name of Loki.

20:33.116 --> 20:37.299
This Loki's the God of chaos.

20:37.299 --> 20:40.476
He causes nothing
but trouble everywhere he go.

20:40.696 --> 20:45.146
No matter how hard
the other gods try to catch him,

20:45.146 --> 20:48.284
the slippery little devil
always manages to escape.

20:48.284 --> 20:50.200
You have 3 seconds to
tell me where he is.

20:50.445 --> 20:53.927
I honestly do not know.

20:53.927 --> 20:56.168
If I did, I would not tell you.

20:58.793 --> 21:00.674
Go ahead, kill me.

21:00.674 --> 21:07.185
I go to my grave happy knowing
that I'm the one who'll bring you down.

21:11.881 --> 21:13.760
Just as I thought.

21:13.760 --> 21:18.740
Killing me does not equate
in your moral mathematics.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.820
Eva!

21:38.820 --> 21:40.978
Whoo-ee, darling.

21:40.978 --> 21:44.830
If you ain't slicker
than a fine gentleman's snot rag.

21:46.915 --> 21:48.590
You ain't looking too
shabby your ownself, gal.

21:48.590 --> 21:50.751
Thank you.

21:54.290 --> 21:56.268
Where'd you get that pretty thing?

21:56.268 --> 21:58.853
Mrs. Bell gave it to me.

21:58.853 --> 21:59.773
What you doing out here?

21:59.773 --> 22:02.150
They're building the town.

22:02.150 --> 22:03.736
A real town.

22:05.307 --> 22:07.785
I've been on the move
for as long as I can remember.

22:07.785 --> 22:11.624
Since before them Indians took me.

22:11.624 --> 22:14.498
I was thinking it might be nice

22:14.498 --> 22:17.842
for us to, you know, settle down.

22:17.842 --> 22:20.262
What you mean?

22:20.262 --> 22:23.768
Well, we're getting hitched,

22:23.768 --> 22:28.422
so why not settle down
like a proper man and wife

22:28.422 --> 22:31.239
and raise a family.

22:31.239 --> 22:33.116
Getting hitched?

22:33.116 --> 22:35.788
Like we talked about.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.501
I ain't never said nothing
about getting hitched.

22:38.501 --> 22:41.545
But I... I thought the other day

22:41.545 --> 22:46.137
you said you wanted me to be yours.

22:46.137 --> 22:47.388
I do.

22:48.724 --> 22:51.772
Well, I thought that meant...

22:51.772 --> 22:53.233
I just ain't thought
things out that far.

22:53.233 --> 22:55.702
And I sure as hell ain't staying

22:55.702 --> 22:58.664
in no Podunk railroad town.

23:02.289 --> 23:06.212
Look at me. Huh?

23:06.212 --> 23:09.759
When they freed me,
I ain't have a penny to my name, Eva.

23:09.759 --> 23:12.180
Now I work for Mr.
Thomas Durant himself.

23:12.180 --> 23:13.381
Oh, I see.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.190
For the first time in my life,

23:18.190 --> 23:19.777
I got money in my pocket.

23:19.777 --> 23:23.807
My money in my pocket.

23:26.746 --> 23:29.249
Might be looking at some
kind of real future.

23:31.254 --> 23:32.839
Without me.

23:32.839 --> 23:34.033
No.

23:34.033 --> 23:35.217
I want it with you.

23:35.217 --> 23:37.972
What, as your private whore?

24:08.479 --> 24:10.824
Ahh, yes, good to see you.

24:21.234 --> 24:22.628
Imagine it.

24:22.628 --> 24:25.049
A journey that now takes 6 months

24:25.049 --> 24:28.388
would be cut to 7 days.

24:28.388 --> 24:32.269
7 days.
It boggles the mind.

24:32.269 --> 24:35.800
You will be able to spend
Christmas in New York and...

24:35.800 --> 24:38.038
New years in San Francisco.

24:38.038 --> 24:41.284
Gentlemen, I give you Mrs. Lily Bell.

24:41.284 --> 24:43.245
Ma'am.
Mrs. Bell.

24:53.420 --> 24:56.357
There's room on the dance floor.

25:07.342 --> 25:09.287
How you been, Miss Eva?

25:12.717 --> 25:14.796
Mr. Toole.

25:14.796 --> 25:17.927
Are you not waiting for Mr. Ferguson?

25:17.927 --> 25:19.995
No, I am not.

25:20.262 --> 25:23.769
Well, if I'm not
overstepping me bounds,

25:23.769 --> 25:28.276
would you do me
the honor of dancing with me?

25:29.445 --> 25:30.756
I'm sorry, Mr. Toole,

25:30.756 --> 25:34.203
I don't much feel
like dancing right now.

25:34.203 --> 25:37.367
I understand.

25:37.367 --> 25:39.378
Thank you, ma'am.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.617
Mr. Toole.

26:12.765 --> 26:15.144
There was a time out in
the frontier with Robert

26:15.144 --> 26:18.465
when I wondered if
this beautiful landscape

26:18.465 --> 26:21.112
might not be better unspoiled.

26:21.112 --> 26:23.408
Part of me still wonders that.

26:24.767 --> 26:27.080
But after seeing all these people

26:27.080 --> 26:30.836
working so hard to build this road,

26:30.836 --> 26:33.388
after understanding
the sheer audacity

26:33.388 --> 26:35.825
of this American endeavor,

26:35.825 --> 26:41.959
well, I see now there
truly is greatness in it.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.778
To Lily Bell,

26:46.400 --> 26:48.879
the fair-haired maiden of the west.

26:48.879 --> 26:51.286
Cheers.
Hear, hear.

27:48.921 --> 27:51.968
You following me?

27:51.968 --> 27:54.617
Oh, no. No, sir.

27:54.617 --> 27:56.768
Just taking the evening air.

28:00.899 --> 28:03.153
What is this?

28:03.153 --> 28:05.574
It's about a payment.

28:05.574 --> 28:08.398
No, not now.

28:08.745 --> 28:09.745
Hey!

28:10.873 --> 28:13.085
Hey! Get your bloody rope off me!

28:13.085 --> 28:16.257
Someone help me.
Get your bloody hands off me!

28:16.257 --> 28:17.468
Your bloody hands off me!

28:17.468 --> 28:18.429
Get off!

28:21.724 --> 28:24.730
We're here to collect a debt,
Mr. Swede.

28:24.730 --> 28:27.818
You be careful, Irish boy,

28:27.818 --> 28:29.738
what you choose to do now,

28:29.738 --> 28:31.157
you son of a bitch, you.

28:31.657 --> 28:32.827
Bloody... aah!

28:32.827 --> 28:34.371
How do you like that?

28:34.371 --> 28:35.497
Aah!

28:36.123 --> 28:37.835
Aah! Uhh!

28:37.835 --> 28:39.462
Bust his head!

28:39.462 --> 28:42.843
Bastard! Get your hands
off me, bloody Irish.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.775
Aah! Aah!

28:52.775 --> 28:54.903
Aah! Aah!

28:56.411 --> 28:57.658
Gah!

29:48.573 --> 29:52.117
Would you like to dance, sir?

29:53.253 --> 29:55.031
I'm sure some of these other fellows

29:55.031 --> 29:58.423
are much better dancers than me.

30:03.236 --> 30:07.188
But I don't want these other fellows.

30:54.283 --> 30:57.311
You'll see a lot of perks
working for me, Mr. Ferguson.

30:57.311 --> 30:59.397
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

31:08.703 --> 31:09.790
Excuse me a second.

31:09.790 --> 31:11.292
Ahh.

31:15.717 --> 31:16.634
Elam!

31:17.085 --> 31:18.562
What the hell are you
doing with my woman?

31:18.562 --> 31:19.565
Hey, now, Ferguson.

31:19.565 --> 31:20.600
Stop it!

31:20.600 --> 31:22.143
Elam, let him go.

31:22.143 --> 31:23.696
Come on. Elam!

31:42.860 --> 31:44.338
I ain't your woman.

31:44.338 --> 31:45.975
You made that pretty clear.

31:45.975 --> 31:48.477
I didn't make nothing clear.
You're still mine.

31:48.477 --> 31:50.355
What, like your property?

31:50.355 --> 31:52.986
I'm staying behind, Elam.

31:52.986 --> 31:56.949
It seems like Mr.
Toole has got the same idea.

31:58.152 --> 31:59.370
You and him?

31:59.370 --> 32:02.035
No, there ain't no me and him.

32:02.035 --> 32:05.422
We're just two people who don't
want to be vagabonds no more.

32:07.534 --> 32:10.930
I love you, Elam,

32:10.930 --> 32:14.444
but I'm tired of being a tramp.

33:30.439 --> 33:34.244
Excuse. I'm sorry,
I'm afraid I need to cut in.

34:39.964 --> 34:41.425
Damn it!

34:52.735 --> 34:54.195
We don't have to do this.

34:54.195 --> 34:58.390
I wasn't there, Mr. Bohannan.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.026
You're a liar.

35:00.026 --> 35:03.098
Johnson said the Sergeant
strangled my wife.

35:03.098 --> 35:05.936
And I saw the picture.

35:05.936 --> 35:08.385
You was the platoon sergeant.

35:08.385 --> 35:09.762
Not then I wasn't.

35:09.762 --> 35:12.080
You raped and murdered my wife.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.644
I wasn't there.

35:13.644 --> 35:15.022
Just admit it.

35:15.022 --> 35:17.287
I can prove it.
No.

35:17.287 --> 35:19.153
You have to be him.

35:19.153 --> 35:20.649
I can prove it.

35:42.354 --> 35:44.152
Uhh!

35:46.655 --> 35:47.656
Uhh!

35:49.034 --> 35:50.621
I...

35:50.621 --> 35:52.415
Uhh!

36:05.102 --> 36:06.313
Ahh!

36:38.977 --> 36:39.978
Uhh.

39:15.703 --> 39:16.704
Hey.

39:19.042 --> 39:20.719
I've been looking for you.

39:20.719 --> 39:23.049
I seen the marshals back there.

39:24.885 --> 39:25.635
Oh.

39:29.526 --> 39:31.730
You killed him?

39:33.065 --> 39:34.902
Yeah.

39:36.838 --> 39:40.153
But he wasn't there.

39:40.153 --> 39:43.449
I killed the wrong man.

39:47.190 --> 39:49.424
What's you gonna do now?
