00:38.760 --> 00:40.840
the world
will have to deal with us.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.880
<i>previously on the 4400...</i>

00:44.880 --> 00:46.360
well, i'm putting together
profiles

00:46.360 --> 00:48.560
of the people
who've taken the shot.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.000
pretty soon,
kevin thinks he'll be able

00:50.000 --> 00:51.600
to predict
who will survive the shot

00:51.600 --> 00:53.040
and who won't.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.520
you're asking me to tell people
not to take promicin?

00:55.520 --> 00:57.240
only for a few months.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.280
i am not making
any announcement.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.240
who are you?

01:01.240 --> 01:03.360
i'm lindsey.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.319
[diana]: this is maia rutledge.

01:05.319 --> 01:06.600
she was the first one
to disappear

01:06.600 --> 01:07.960
as far as we can tell.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.200
[maia]:
they're dead, aren't they?

01:09.200 --> 01:11.560
[curtis peck]:
there's a faction of elites

01:11.560 --> 01:14.240
who want the future
to stay exactly as it is.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.360
i call them "the marked."

01:17.360 --> 01:20.440
[marco]: what about imroth?
the ceo of ubient software's

01:20.440 --> 01:23.000
supposed to be some kind of
double agent from the future?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.840
tell the others
i went to see the ntac agents.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.400
baldwin thinks
it's some kind of ploy.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.920
when we need him,
he'll be there for us.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.200
you're becoming
your new self.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.080
do what tom baldwin would do.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.560
find isabelle tyler.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.160
you...

01:38.160 --> 01:41.280
have to take
your abilities back.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.760
then you're going to bring
jordan collier to me.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.960
[sighs]

01:55.800 --> 01:57.680
[gasps]

01:59.200 --> 02:00.960
tom, what's going on?

02:03.960 --> 02:05.120
i felt restless.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.200
i kept tossing and turning,

02:06.200 --> 02:07.760
and i...

02:07.760 --> 02:09.160
i didn't want to wake you.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.280
so you were just...
sitting there?

02:12.280 --> 02:14.600
no. i was watching you sleep.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.000
it's kind of relaxing.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.560
well, i'm awake now.

02:20.800 --> 02:24.000
so why don't you
come back to bed?

02:36.720 --> 02:37.880
there.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.400
isn't this
more relaxing?

02:49.760 --> 02:51.160
andaluca's?

02:51.160 --> 02:53.240
isn't that
a little bit fancy?

02:53.240 --> 02:54.280
so?

02:54.280 --> 02:56.160
i'm not a little kid
anymore.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.520
i just miss the days

02:57.520 --> 02:58.840
when the only place
you'd eat

02:58.840 --> 03:01.480
was charlie's
pizza palace.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.000
mom, that was, like,
a long time ago.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
oh, yeah,
at least a year.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.480
besides, it'd be fun

03:08.480 --> 03:09.880
eating spanish food
with ben again.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.360
honey, i hope you're not
getting your hopes up

03:12.360 --> 03:13.640
for nothing.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.160
i know that ben said
that he might make it,

03:15.160 --> 03:18.040
but london is a long way off.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.640
i promise
i won't be disappointed,

03:20.640 --> 03:21.880
but on my birthday,
it's just been...

03:21.880 --> 03:23.640
i don't know,
just you and me,

03:23.640 --> 03:25.440
and with ben,
it would feel more like family.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.360
whoa!
excuse me!

03:32.520 --> 03:33.640
are you okay?

03:33.640 --> 03:35.080
yeah.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.080
what's that?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.400
[shouting]

03:53.920 --> 03:56.000
is this real money?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.760
certainly looks like it.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.680
"these little green
scraps of paper

04:00.680 --> 04:02.640
"you're fighting over

04:02.640 --> 04:04.520
are worthless."

04:04.520 --> 04:06.840
"welcome to
the new world."

04:06.840 --> 04:08.680
the new world?

04:08.680 --> 04:10.240
that's right out of
jordan collier's playbook.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.880
it sounds like it,

04:11.880 --> 04:14.040
but can we be really sure
these atm malfunctions

04:14.040 --> 04:16.680
are being caused
by some 4400 ability?

04:16.680 --> 04:17.680
because it could be
the work

04:17.680 --> 04:19.399
of some sophisticated
computer hacker

04:19.399 --> 04:22.320
who's just looking
to create some havoc.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.360
actually,
i have to go with

04:23.360 --> 04:24.560
a p-positive here,
diana.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.480
so far, 58 atms

04:26.480 --> 04:27.800
from four separate
banking institutions

04:27.800 --> 04:28.800
have been affected.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.120
that means four separate
computer mainframes

04:30.120 --> 04:31.280
have been compromised.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.880
thousands and thousands
of dollars

04:32.880 --> 04:34.360
are being randomly
dispensed.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.800
every time they shut down
a cash machine,

04:35.800 --> 04:37.160
another one goes
haywire.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.200
i'd like to meet
the computer hacker

04:38.200 --> 04:39.160
that can pull that off--

04:39.160 --> 04:40.600
you know,
without an ability.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.800
pretty aggressive move, though,
i mean, even for collier.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.520
you want to create
a new world,

04:44.520 --> 04:46.160
first, you have to
destroy the old one,

04:46.160 --> 04:48.080
and disrupting the economy's
a pretty good way to start.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.640
i wouldn't mind
driving.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.720
does that work
for you?

04:52.720 --> 04:53.960
yeah, be my guest.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.040
i'm going to need
an hour or two

04:55.040 --> 04:56.080
before we go see
collier.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.520
is there something wrong?

04:57.520 --> 04:58.640
hopefully not.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.200
i've got an appointment
for a cat-scan.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.160
what?

05:01.160 --> 05:03.280
it's just a precaution.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.520
ever since the mole came back,
i've been a little on edge.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.120
you don't feel any different,
do you?

05:07.120 --> 05:08.640
you mean, am i
one of the marked?

05:08.640 --> 05:11.880
some kind of zombie
controlled by a future human?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.880
not... not yet, anyway.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.240
look, i'll call you

05:15.240 --> 05:16.320
when i'm done
with the hospital.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.520
uh-huh.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.840
are you sure you won't
reconsider, mr. chatha?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.800
taking the shot
would be hugely beneficial,

05:24.800 --> 05:25.880
not only to you,

05:25.880 --> 05:27.320
but to the millions
of your readers

05:27.320 --> 05:30.400
who would follow your example.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.520
yes, but you have to
understand

05:32.520 --> 05:34.800
that there is
no guarantee

05:34.800 --> 05:36.880
that this alleged
compatibility test

05:36.880 --> 05:40.320
of shawn farrell's
will ever be perfected.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.360
[sighs]

05:41.360 --> 05:42.320
yes.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.280
yes, well,
if you change your mind,

05:44.280 --> 05:47.200
the door's always open.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.240
we have your cousin
to thank for that.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.360
but maneck chatha's
name is on the list

05:50.360 --> 05:51.600
in the white light book.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.160
we already know
he can survive the shot.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.280
it's his followers
he's worried about.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.720
why risk their lives

05:56.720 --> 05:58.480
when shawn's announced
it's only a matter of time

05:58.480 --> 06:00.320
before the test is available?

06:06.840 --> 06:08.720
too bad
you lost chatha.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.760
it wouldn't have happened

06:09.760 --> 06:10.840
if you'd done
what i told you to.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.120
yeah, i know.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.440
stop shawn, right?

06:13.440 --> 06:15.200
what does that mean
exactly?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.080
i was hoping
you'd figure that out

06:17.080 --> 06:18.480
for yourself.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.560
shawn's not developing
this test by himself.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.640
what you need to do

06:22.640 --> 06:26.760
is get rid of
kevin burkhoff.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.800
get rid of him?

06:28.800 --> 06:32.360
what am i supposed to do
exactly, kill the guy?

06:32.360 --> 06:34.240
i expect you to do
whatever it takes

06:34.240 --> 06:35.480
to fulfill
the prophecy

06:35.480 --> 06:39.040
and help jordan collier
bring heaven to earth.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.920
good morning,
isabelle.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.760
i hope you're feeling at home.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.840
you know, i have to say,
of all of our...

07:00.840 --> 07:02.480
real estate holdings,

07:02.480 --> 07:05.360
this place
is my favorite.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.400
you know,
i thought you'd like to know,

07:10.400 --> 07:12.640
tomorrow, your father's
being moved from seattle

07:12.640 --> 07:14.440
to an ntac holding facility
in virginia,

07:14.440 --> 07:15.800
which means

07:15.800 --> 07:16.760
you need to agree
to take your abilities back

07:16.760 --> 07:18.400
before richard
steps on that plane,

07:18.400 --> 07:20.360
because if you don't,
he's not getting off it.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.640
you already caused
your mother's death.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.120
do you want to be responsible
for your father's, too?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.400
even if i agreed
to take the shot,

07:29.400 --> 07:30.320
what's the point?

07:30.320 --> 07:31.880
the government doctors
already told me

07:31.880 --> 07:33.360
that promicin will kill me.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.680
we can change that, isabelle.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.960
i guarantee you'll live

07:36.960 --> 07:38.120
<u>to fulfill</u>

07:38.120 --> 07:39.240
to destroy the 4400,

07:39.240 --> 07:40.360
and anyone else

07:40.360 --> 07:41.440
with a trace of promicin
in their system,

07:41.440 --> 07:42.440
and you will start

07:42.440 --> 07:45.520
by bringing us jordan collier.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.160
you know, kyle used to
talk about you all the time.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.520
he said
you were a decent man,

07:50.520 --> 07:53.800
but then you're not tom baldwin,
are you?

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
[laughs]

07:54.800 --> 07:56.400
tom baldwin...

07:56.400 --> 07:59.240
tom baldwin was a confused
and unhappy man.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.960
i've given him
the clarity of purpose

08:00.960 --> 08:02.200
he desperately needed,

08:02.200 --> 08:04.840
and i want to give that
to you, isabelle.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.320
after all, i created you--

08:06.320 --> 08:07.400
placed you
in your mother's womb

08:07.400 --> 08:08.360
to make sure
you were sent back

08:08.360 --> 08:10.040
in that ball of light,

08:10.040 --> 08:12.960
so you could protect
the world from the 4400.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.840
no, isabelle,

08:16.840 --> 08:18.200
promicin is evil.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.080
people who use it are evil.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.400
their goal isn't
to change the world,

08:21.400 --> 08:22.480
it is to end it.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.760
you can stop them.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.200
you have to stop them.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.400
it's what you're meant to do.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.240
how can you say no
to your destiny?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.640
[***]

08:42.960 --> 08:47.840
* so long ago, another life *

08:47.840 --> 08:51.920
* i can feel your heart beat *

08:51.920 --> 08:56.880
* it's not a dream
remember us *

08:56.880 --> 09:00.880
* i can see it in your eyes *

09:00.880 --> 09:04.240
* we'll find our place in time *

09:04.240 --> 09:09.720
* our place in time
beyond the sun *

09:09.720 --> 09:13.120
* we'll find our place in time *

09:13.120 --> 09:17.880
* our place in time
to call our own *

09:30.640 --> 09:32.560
manual labor
in promise city?

09:32.560 --> 09:33.840
isn't that
a bit old school?

09:33.840 --> 09:36.240
nothing wrong with old school,

09:36.240 --> 09:39.120
when it comes to
a little sweat and muscle.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.240
having an ability can
lead to complacency,

09:41.240 --> 09:42.400
and complacency...

09:42.400 --> 09:45.440
is the measure
of a dying society.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.040
welcome to the new world.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.560
you're here
about the attacks

09:48.560 --> 09:49.800
on the banking system.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.440
you know about that?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.520
i try to
stay current,

09:52.520 --> 09:53.880
but i can assure you

09:53.880 --> 09:55.800
that despite the attacker's
utopian signature,

09:55.800 --> 09:57.720
nobody here
had anything to do with it.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.520
can you really
be sure of that?

09:59.520 --> 10:00.480
you must have, like,
500 people

10:00.480 --> 10:01.920
living here by now.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.320
and nobody here
would do something like that

10:03.320 --> 10:04.560
without jordan's consent.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.160
which i didn't give.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.440
well, ju

10:07.440 --> 10:09.480
let us talk to your people,
and if nobody did it,

10:09.480 --> 10:10.960
then maybe
they can help us find out

10:10.960 --> 10:12.040
who the hell is responsible.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.600
i'm afraid i can't do that.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.680
you mean you won't.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.680
whoever's doing this
has my best wishes.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.920
the system you live in
is obsolete.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.280
any society that worships
at the altar of wealth

10:23.280 --> 10:24.720
is doomed,

10:24.720 --> 10:26.640
so why not flood
the streets with money...

10:26.640 --> 10:27.760
<i>[voice echoes distantly]:
till those little</i>

10:27.760 --> 10:29.040
<i>pieces of paper</i>

10:29.040 --> 10:29.840
<i>are as worthless
as confetti.</i>

10:29.840 --> 10:32.840
[shouting in rage]

10:34.080 --> 10:35.520
christ, tom, no!

10:35.520 --> 10:37.480
no!

10:37.480 --> 10:38.480
dad, don't.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.560
please don't...
please don't, dad.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.880
because the future
i believe in

10:42.880 --> 10:44.400
is one that exists

10:44.400 --> 10:45.800
without the need
for money.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.080
it's a world
where miracles

10:47.080 --> 10:48.480
are common currency.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.320
now, excuse me,
i have some work to do.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.960
it's not just atms anymore.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.320
we're looking at
computer system failures

10:58.320 --> 10:59.320
all over the country.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.560
make that the world.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.880
federal agencies,
financial institutions,

11:02.880 --> 11:04.080
private businesses,

11:04.080 --> 11:05.680
even your friendly
neighborhood laptops

11:05.680 --> 11:06.880
are all crashing,

11:06.880 --> 11:08.080
victims of the same
corrosive virus

11:08.080 --> 11:09.360
that infected the atms.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.080
yeah, and these attacks
are anything but random.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.760
yeah, every
malfunctioning computer,

11:12.760 --> 11:14.160
including
the original atms

11:14.160 --> 11:15.320
has one thing in common.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.800
they all run ubient's

11:16.800 --> 11:18.240
enzyme
operating system.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.560
ubient?

11:19.560 --> 11:21.760
that's drew imroth's
company.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.800
so, i guess the question
we have to ask is this,

11:24.800 --> 11:28.120
are these attacks
against drew imroth,

11:28.120 --> 11:30.000
the multi-billionaire
corporate giant?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.880
or drew imroth,
the alleged member

11:31.880 --> 11:33.480
of the global conspiracy
known as the marked?

11:33.480 --> 11:34.960
the operative word
is "alleged."

11:34.960 --> 11:36.160
we don't even have
any hard evidence

11:36.160 --> 11:37.600
that the marked
exist.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.880
tom and i
are pretty certain.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.440
yeah, that's right,

11:41.440 --> 11:42.560
but even so,

11:42.560 --> 11:44.560
ubient is the biggest
corporations in the world.

11:44.560 --> 11:49.640
if it goes under,
we're all in trouble.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.680
sorry. i didn't mean
to interrupt.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.520
no, um, everybody,
this is abigail hunnicutt.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.960
she's new.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.440
we were lucky
to grab her.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.960
abigail's been
teaching a course

11:58.960 --> 12:00.800
in combinatorics
and probability

12:00.800 --> 12:02.640
at m.i.t. since she was 22.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.920
i also worked my way
through graduate school

12:04.920 --> 12:06.000
in the men's department
at sak's.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.440
so who knows?

12:07.440 --> 12:08.840
maybe i can...

12:08.840 --> 12:11.120
teach these guys
how to dress like grown-ups.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.200
i thought
everyone should see this.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.080
it's some kind of manifesto.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.720
every computer
infected with the virus

12:20.720 --> 12:22.520
is printing it out.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.880
it's calling for
the destruction

12:23.880 --> 12:25.760
of all ubient
software.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.920
which is why, marked or not,

12:26.920 --> 12:28.600
we need to speak with
drew imroth.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.400
[telephone rings]

12:30.400 --> 12:31.520
hello?

12:31.520 --> 12:34.040
hey, maia.
it's me lindsey.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.160
happy birthday.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.160
<i>hi.</i>

12:36.160 --> 12:37.320
<i>i can't believe
you remembered.</i>

12:37.320 --> 12:39.440
you know, it's not
for another two days.

12:39.440 --> 12:40.680
<i>whatever.</i>

12:40.680 --> 12:42.680
i have got
the coolest gift for you.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.960
you want to come over?

12:43.960 --> 12:45.360
<i>it's not that
kind of present.</i>

12:45.360 --> 12:47.560
you have to come to promise city
and see it for yourself.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.280
my mom really wants me
to stay away from there.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.400
<i>she doesn't
have to know.</i>

12:51.400 --> 12:53.400
<i>you are so going to
thank me for this.</i>

12:53.400 --> 12:54.480
[sighs]

12:54.480 --> 12:56.200
i guess i can come by
tomorrow after school.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.680
meet me at the southwest corner
of beacon and 64th street

12:59.680 --> 13:00.800
at 3:30.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.280
i've got some friends here

13:02.280 --> 13:04.440
who will help us sneak past
the government blockade.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.480
okay, bye.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.680
yes, mr. secretary,

13:12.680 --> 13:15.560
i understand how sensitive
your department records are,

13:15.560 --> 13:17.600
and i promise that once we get
the problem resolved,

13:17.600 --> 13:20.280
ubient will do
everything possible

13:20.280 --> 13:22.320
to retrieve
your lost data.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.640
believe me, sir,
i feel your pain.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.880
i'm a stockholder, too.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.120
i warned you

13:32.120 --> 13:34.600
that something like this
was going to happen.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.880
jordan collier

13:35.880 --> 13:40.240
and his followers
are bent on global revolution,

13:40.240 --> 13:41.600
and this assault on my company

13:41.600 --> 13:43.640
is the opening salvo.

13:43.640 --> 13:44.920
we just came from
promise city.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.360
collier's denying
any involvement.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.720
well, i don't believe that,

13:47.720 --> 13:49.360
and i certainly hope
y  you two don't either!

13:49.360 --> 13:52.560
whether it's collier's people
or some rogue p-positive,

13:52.560 --> 13:54.120
it doesn't really matter,
we'll find him.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.800
when will that be, huh?

13:56.800 --> 13:59.240
will i still have
a company left by then?

13:59.240 --> 14:00.640
we're doing our best.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.080
all of this could
have been avoided

14:02.080 --> 14:04.400
if you people had done your jobs
in the first place,

14:04.400 --> 14:06.280
but, no,
you were too busy

14:06.280 --> 14:08.000
chasing after
imaginary conspiracies.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.160
how about it, agent baldwin?

14:11.160 --> 14:13.360
would you like to check
my mole again?

14:14.560 --> 14:16.760
that won't be necessary.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.640
glad to see you finally have
your priorities straight.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.560
i just hope it's not too late
to save my company.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.960
with all your success
over the years,

14:24.960 --> 14:26.440
you must have made
your share of enemies.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.600
thousands of them.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.640
in fact, i keep a list

14:29.640 --> 14:34.320
of everyone who's ever sent me
a threatening letter or email.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.080
organized by level
of vehemence.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.360
it's a hobby.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.720
is steve jobs
on page one?

14:41.720 --> 14:43.960
you might want to give him
a promicin test.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.920
[knocking]

14:53.920 --> 14:55.560
dr. burkhoff,

14:55.560 --> 14:56.920
you ready
for a break?

14:56.920 --> 14:58.360
not now.

14:58.360 --> 15:02.240
i lost quite a bit of data
when this computer crashed.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.120
right, that's
that ubient virus.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.040
the net's down
in the entire building.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.240
is that supposed to
make me feel better?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.080
i have to reconstruct

15:09.080 --> 15:10.760
a 74-page document
from memory,

15:10.760 --> 15:12.560
and i'm on, like, what?

15:12.560 --> 15:13.920
page 12?

15:13.920 --> 15:15.480
well, i appreciate
your dedication,

15:15.480 --> 15:16.560
but i kind of promised tess

15:16.560 --> 15:17.680
that i'd get you
out of the lab

15:17.680 --> 15:18.760
once in a while.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.040
you spoke to tess?
yeah, just now.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.600
sounds like she's having
a great time with her niece.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.640
grand-niece, actually.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.720
tess was born in 1937.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.760
right, sorry.
i forgot.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.200
okay, you need a break.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.360
i got a surprise for you.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.600
come on,
it's a massage.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.760
she's waiting
upstairs.

15:34.760 --> 15:35.840
no, thank you.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.520
i don't like strangers
touching me.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.880
the human hand can be so...
clammy.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.880
okay, but i already paid
for the hour.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.120
well, be my guest.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.680
enjoy yourself.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.200
i'll just be down here,

15:48.200 --> 15:50.120
working to save
thousands of lives

15:50.120 --> 15:52.520
and change the world
for the better.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.280
okay.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.440
thank you.

15:59.240 --> 16:02.440
you know,
imroth was not joking

16:02.440 --> 16:03.880
when he said he had
a lot of enemies.

16:03.880 --> 16:04.840
this is going to
take all night

16:04.840 --> 16:06.120
to get through this.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.000
yeah, i think i'm going to
take my half home.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.280
that's a good idea.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.120
you really surprised me today
at imrot's office.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.240
the way you reacted

16:13.240 --> 16:15.520
when he got
in your face.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.720
well, the guy was having
a rough day.

16:16.720 --> 16:17.880
i was trying to be diplomatic.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.160
i mean, considering
what we suspect him of.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.360
because he brought up
the marked,

16:21.360 --> 16:22.440
and you didn't even...

16:22.440 --> 16:23.720
well, pursue it.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.280
neither did you.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.680
look, it's not like he was
going to admit to anything.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.600
i promise, the next time
he gives us some attitude,

16:31.600 --> 16:33.560
you'll see
some fireworks, okay?

16:33.560 --> 16:34.560
good night.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.520
tom?
yeah?

16:36.520 --> 16:39.920
did you, uh, get the results
of the cat scan?

16:39.920 --> 16:41.240
oh, yeah.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.240
yeah, i'm fine.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.600
thanks for asking.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.800
good night.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.040
[woman giggling]

17:22.560 --> 17:23.520
hello?

17:23.520 --> 17:24.520
hello.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.000
hi, kevin.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.079
i'm back.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.120
tess?

17:29.120 --> 17:31.160
out here.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.240
see me?

17:32.240 --> 17:33.560
tess?

17:33.560 --> 17:35.360
come find me.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.520
i thought you weren't
coming back for a few days.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.840
kevin,
i'm over here.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.200
where are you?

17:46.200 --> 17:48.160
you found me.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.960
i brought your breakfast.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.200
come on.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.280
orders are you're
supposed to eat.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.840
let her go!

18:27.840 --> 18:29.000
we're not supposed
to hurt her.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.400
[choking]

18:41.280 --> 18:42.920
morning, diana.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.200
hi.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.920
read any good
death threats lately?

18:45.920 --> 18:48.120
too many.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.160
so, what do we got,
like, 8,000 suspects?

18:51.160 --> 18:53.080
good luck
tracking them all down.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.840
so how was your night?

18:57.840 --> 18:59.320
it was kind of strange.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.440
i was on my way home

19:00.440 --> 19:03.680
when i got a phone call
from drew imroth.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.760
yeah, i know,
it threw me, too.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.160
anyway, he told me
he had to see me right away,

19:09.160 --> 19:10.520
alone at madison park.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.920
it all felt a little
cloak and dagger,

19:11.920 --> 19:13.200
but what was i
going to do?

19:13.200 --> 19:14.240
i guess you had to go.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.400
exactly.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.400
turns out, he wants me
to pass the case off

19:17.400 --> 19:18.560
to another agent.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.840
he's worried
that i'm still obsessed

19:19.840 --> 19:21.320
about proving
he's one of the marked.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.400
oh.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.080
what did you
tell him?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.120
the truth.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.600
that he had nothing
to worry about.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.480
that i'd do my job to
the best of my abilities.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.480
then i asked him
to name

19:30.480 --> 19:31.800
every member
of the marked,

19:31.800 --> 19:32.960
which led to
some of the fireworks

19:32.960 --> 19:33.920
you were hoping for.

19:33.920 --> 19:34.880
[cell phone rings]

19:34.880 --> 19:36.320
oh...

19:36.320 --> 19:37.440
you know what?
i better take this.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.440
i'll see you in there.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.400
baldwin...

19:45.600 --> 19:48.480
when?

19:48.480 --> 19:50.640
is isabelle all right?

19:52.240 --> 19:53.400
fine.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.600
i'll have to
make an excuse here.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.800
i'll be right over.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.320
joanna...

20:02.320 --> 20:03.520
what happened?
where's kevin?

20:03.520 --> 20:04.600
i don't know.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.280
the cleaning staff
came in this morning.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.800
this is how
they found the place.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.120
all his work
is missing, too.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.040
this was jordan.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.160
it had to be.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.800
he knows about
the compatibility test.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.520
it's so strange.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.200
all those people
willing to risk their lives

20:26.200 --> 20:28.640
to get an ability.

20:28.640 --> 20:33.160
thinking it'll make them
feel less alone,

20:33.160 --> 20:37.000
more powerful.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.960
i never felt more alone
and less powerful

20:38.960 --> 20:43.520
than when i had
limitless abilities.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.720
it overwhelmed my entire life.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.960
became my identity.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.520
cut me off from everyone...

20:48.520 --> 20:52.400
my parents, shawn...

20:55.520 --> 20:56.600
it's only
when i lost everything

20:56.600 --> 20:58.080
that i found myself,

20:58.080 --> 21:01.400
and now you want me
to go back there,

21:01.400 --> 21:03.280
become
that person again.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.520
that person is who you are.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.440
it won't be that bad, isabelle.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.520
these past few months,
you got a little vacation,

21:11.520 --> 21:13.880
you spent a little time
out in the world,

21:13.880 --> 21:18.600
but now it's time
to go back to work.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.800
it was nice to be normal...

21:23.720 --> 21:26.040
at least for a little while.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.880
okay, so this is
a modification

21:45.880 --> 21:47.520
of a document
authorization program

21:47.520 --> 21:49.320
abigail designed
while she was at m.i.t.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.400
we used it to cross-reference
the language

21:51.400 --> 21:53.040
in the anti-ubient
manifesto

21:53.040 --> 21:54.720
with the hate mail
directed at drew imroth.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.280
we were looking for
idiosyncratic phrases

21:56.280 --> 21:57.360
and word choices

21:57.360 --> 21:58.600
with a high degree
of similarity

21:58.600 --> 22:00.480
in both documents.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.120
now, you can see
whoever wrote the manifesto

22:02.120 --> 22:04.480
likes to use semi-colons
by the handful.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.160
he's also fond of "who"
or "which"

22:06.160 --> 22:07.600
instead of "that,"

22:07.600 --> 22:10.000
and he refers to imroth
as "mr. puppetmaster,"

22:10.000 --> 22:11.840
a phrase he repeats
a total of six times,

22:11.840 --> 22:13.520
and what do we find

22:13.520 --> 22:14.520
in the hate mail
department?

22:14.520 --> 22:16.440
this document.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.400
semi-colons.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.480
"who" and "which"
used again

22:18.480 --> 22:19.560
instead of "that,"

22:19.560 --> 22:22.040
and finally, our old friend,
"mr. puppetmaster."

22:22.040 --> 22:25.200
so the two authors
are one and the same.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.480
do you have a name for us?

22:26.480 --> 22:28.360
this e-mail
is signed "swindled."

22:28.360 --> 22:29.600
imroth put
his people on it.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.680
they traced it
to a warren trask.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.240
turns out,
back in the early '80s,

22:33.240 --> 22:35.320
trask designed
a primitive version

22:35.320 --> 22:36.760
of the enzyme operating system.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.720
when imroth came out with
a very similar program,

22:38.720 --> 22:39.800
trask sued.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.440
let me guess.
he lost.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.440
no, no, it never
went to court.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.960
imroth offered trask
an out-of-court settlement.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.920
trask wound up with $100,000.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.600
meanwhile,
enzyme has made imroth billions.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.960
so the guy's pissed.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.160
wouldn't you be?

22:52.160 --> 22:53.480
you can ask him
yourself.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.640
he lives right here
in seattle.

22:56.880 --> 22:57.920
well, nice work, marco.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.480
actually,
it was all abigail.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.040
she buy you
that suit, too?

23:07.680 --> 23:09.520
stop looking
so freaked out.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.680
we're almost there.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.360
i told you
i can't stay long.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.360
if my mom finds out--

23:13.360 --> 23:16.000
she won't.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.720
i promised you
a birthday surprise, right?

23:20.720 --> 23:23.800
well, here it is.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.800
maia...

23:32.800 --> 23:34.840
mom?

23:34.840 --> 23:36.480
dad?

23:36.480 --> 23:38.960
maia,
is it really you?

23:38.960 --> 23:41.760
vic, can you believe
how big she's gotten?

23:41.760 --> 23:43.800
she's still
my little girl.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.560
i only wish
i could give you

23:45.560 --> 23:49.040
a great,
big birthday hug.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.080
me too.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.280
but you can't.

23:52.280 --> 23:56.200
you're just somebody's
4400 ability.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.120
whatever we are,
we're your parents,

23:59.120 --> 24:00.960
and we love you
so much.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.600
excuse me.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.800
i'm agent baldwin,
this is agent skouris.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.920
we're with ntac.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.680
we're here to see
warren trask.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.120
i'm his daughter, eileen.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.200
what's this all about?

24:20.200 --> 24:21.520
we'd like to
ask your father

24:21.520 --> 24:23.600
some questions
about drew imroth.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.760
well, you can ask him
anything you want.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.680
just don't expect any answers.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.320
my dad had a stroke
three months ago.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.400
he hasn't moved a muscle or said a word since

24:45.740 --> 24:47.460
my father was a brilliant man,

24:47.460 --> 24:49.060
but he was naive and trusting,

24:49.060 --> 24:51.660
and drew imroth
took advantage of that

24:51.660 --> 24:53.860
to cheat my father
out of his life's work.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.100
his career,
his marriage,

24:56.100 --> 24:58.820
his... health.

24:58.820 --> 25:00.540
my father
lost it all.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.460
so when did he take
the promicin shot?

25:02.460 --> 25:04.140
about
six months ago.

25:04.140 --> 25:05.820
as far as i know,
it didn't do anything,

25:05.820 --> 25:08.020
no ability, nothing,

25:08.020 --> 25:09.820
and then he had
the aneurysm.

25:09.820 --> 25:11.420
do you really still believe

25:11.420 --> 25:13.380
he's behind
what's happening to ubient?

25:13.380 --> 25:15.180
all these machines
he's hooked up to,

25:15.180 --> 25:16.740
they're run by computer,

25:16.740 --> 25:18.060
so he's connected
to networks

25:18.060 --> 25:19.180
for emergency response
monitoring.

25:19.180 --> 25:20.460
if his mind
is still functioning,

25:20.460 --> 25:21.580
and he's got
an ability,

25:21.580 --> 25:22.660
then, yeah,

25:22.660 --> 25:23.860
he could be
the ghost in the machine.

25:23.860 --> 25:26.980
well, that would be...

25:26.980 --> 25:29.620
wonderful.

25:29.620 --> 25:31.620
daddy,

25:31.620 --> 25:32.780
if that's true,

25:32.780 --> 25:35.140
i am so happy
for you.

25:35.140 --> 25:38.860
don't stop until you ruin imroth
like he ruined you.

25:38.860 --> 25:39.580
that's enough of that.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.660
ow!

25:40.660 --> 25:41.700
you're hurting me.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.580
tom, let her go.

25:43.580 --> 25:46.060
she's an accessory
to a half-dozen felonies.

25:46.060 --> 25:47.260
if there is anything
you are holding back,

25:47.260 --> 25:49.380
you'd better
tell us now.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.980
i don't know anything,

25:51.980 --> 25:54.540
but if my father
is bringing down drew imroth,

25:54.540 --> 25:57.060
i'd consider that
justice.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.260
am i mistaken,

26:10.260 --> 26:13.140
or am i looking at
a xerces blue butterfly?

26:13.140 --> 26:15.100
i believe
that's what it's called.

26:15.100 --> 26:19.220
the xerces blue
has been extinct since 1941.

26:19.220 --> 26:20.260
not here.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.820
not anymore.

26:21.820 --> 26:23.980
we have a resident
who can modify dna

26:23.980 --> 26:25.420
to recreate
extinct species.

26:25.420 --> 26:27.300
only insects so far,

26:27.300 --> 26:28.820
but he hopes to
work his way up to mammals.

26:28.820 --> 26:29.860
i don't know about you,

26:29.860 --> 26:31.140
but i'd love to see
a woolly mammoth

26:31.140 --> 26:32.260
in the flesh.

26:40.020 --> 26:41.660
i'm impressed...

26:44.020 --> 26:46.220
and i'm not easily impressed.

26:48.460 --> 26:50.100
a man
of your intellect

26:50.100 --> 26:51.700
could do
just about anything

26:51.700 --> 26:55.020
here in promise city.

26:55.020 --> 26:57.740
which might be
a more persuasive argument

26:57.740 --> 26:59.300
if i weren't
a kidnap victim

26:59.300 --> 27:00.620
being held
against my will.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.140
it was my idea
to bring you here.

27:02.140 --> 27:03.460
jordan knew nothing
about it.

27:03.460 --> 27:05.140
oh, and is that

27:05.140 --> 27:06.300
supposed to make
everything all right?

27:06.300 --> 27:09.180
kyle's method
might have been extreme,

27:09.180 --> 27:10.940
but i can't fault
his motive.

27:10.940 --> 27:13.620
you belong here
in promise city

27:13.620 --> 27:14.460
with us, kevin.

27:14.460 --> 27:15.940
you are the father

27:15.940 --> 27:18.100
of the promicin
movement.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.300
without your
discoveries,

27:19.300 --> 27:22.860
promise city
wouldn't even exist.

27:22.860 --> 27:25.260
i made
a scientific breakthrough...

27:27.660 --> 27:30.860
but i didn't start
a religious cult.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.100
[sighs]

27:32.100 --> 27:33.220
kevin,
like it or not,

27:33.220 --> 27:36.140
you're revered by everyone here.

27:36.140 --> 27:37.700
however, i cannot allow
your research to continue.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.340
a promicin
compatibility test

27:40.340 --> 27:42.940
would be death to this movement.

27:42.940 --> 27:45.500
all i'm trying to do
is save lives, jordan.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.700
so are we.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.340
we're just thinking
a little more long-term.

27:50.340 --> 27:52.020
so...

27:52.020 --> 27:54.220
until you share our vision,

27:54.220 --> 27:56.820
i'm afraid i'll have to insist
you remain our guest.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.820
tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.?

28:00.820 --> 28:02.700
i was kind of hoping for
something sooner.

28:02.700 --> 28:04.500
no, no, we can't prove
conclusively

28:04.500 --> 28:05.620
that trask's our man,

28:05.620 --> 28:07.460
but we know he took
the promicin shot.

28:07.460 --> 28:09.900
okay, if that's
the best you can do.

28:09.900 --> 28:11.700
okay, thanks.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.060
we can't get a court order

28:13.060 --> 28:14.740
to move trask to ntac medical
till morning.

28:14.740 --> 28:18.340
but ubient is hemmoraging
millions of dollars an hour.

28:18.340 --> 28:20.100
the stock market is down
over 500 points,

28:20.100 --> 28:21.300
and i don't know
about you,

28:21.300 --> 28:22.380
but my pension plan
is pretty much history.

28:22.380 --> 28:23.380
we've done all we can
to isolate him.

28:23.380 --> 28:24.540
we've cut off the phone services

28:24.540 --> 28:25.860
and internet
to his home.

28:25.860 --> 28:27.900
we don't even know if he needs
a phone line to access the net.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.100
we need to get trask
on the inhibitor,

28:29.100 --> 28:30.180
and we need to do it now--

28:30.180 --> 28:31.180
it's not an option.

28:31.180 --> 28:32.460
his doctors
have ruled it out.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.340
given the state of his health,
it's way too risky.

28:34.340 --> 28:36.420
well, maybe
it's worth the risk.

28:36.420 --> 28:38.180
just keeping trask
under wraps at ntac

28:38.180 --> 28:40.140
is no guarantee that the attacks
against ubient will stop.

28:40.140 --> 28:42.060
what are you suggesting, tom,
we kill him?

28:42.060 --> 28:43.100
of course not!

28:48.340 --> 28:49.540
it's just...

28:49.540 --> 28:51.580
look, it's just frustrating,
for all of us.

28:51.580 --> 28:52.820
anyhow,

28:52.820 --> 28:54.860
i guess there's
nothing we can do till morning.

29:03.660 --> 29:06.420
hey, birthday girl,
i'm home!

29:06.420 --> 29:07.580
why aren't you
dressed yet?

29:07.580 --> 29:09.060
the dinner reservation's
for 7:00.

29:09.060 --> 29:10.220
i'll be ready in time.

29:10.220 --> 29:11.620
okay, then we come home
and open the presents,

29:11.620 --> 29:12.740
all right?

29:12.740 --> 29:14.660
that'll be good.

29:14.660 --> 29:15.620
what's wrong?

29:15.620 --> 29:17.060
did something
happen today?

29:17.060 --> 29:18.620
no.

29:18.620 --> 29:20.580
i told you not to get
your hopes up about ben.

29:22.020 --> 29:24.740
i told you,
i'm past all that.

29:24.740 --> 29:25.860
well, that's good,

29:25.860 --> 29:26.980
because i don't know about you,

29:26.980 --> 29:28.300
but i'm ready
for some birthday cake,

29:28.300 --> 29:29.500
so let's get going,

29:29.500 --> 29:31.260
okay?

29:49.900 --> 29:52.460
[cell phone rings]

29:54.820 --> 29:55.660
yeah?

29:55.660 --> 29:56.780
<i>it's me.</i>

29:56.780 --> 29:58.260
tell me you've got good news.

29:58.260 --> 29:59.540
because at this rate,

29:59.540 --> 30:01.460
ubient software
will cease to exist

30:01.460 --> 30:02.780
in three days,

30:02.780 --> 30:04.260
which means we lose
all our financial backing,

30:04.260 --> 30:06.540
<i>not to mention
our spyware program--</i>

30:06.540 --> 30:08.820
i get it.
don't worry.

30:08.820 --> 30:10.700
i'm taking care of it.

30:10.700 --> 30:11.740
<i>i hope so.</i>

30:44.460 --> 30:47.420
oh, my god, daddy?

30:47.420 --> 30:48.580
daddy?

30:54.460 --> 30:57.380
come on!

30:57.380 --> 30:59.020
come on.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.020
come on...

31:20.780 --> 31:22.940
half a dozen residents
claimed they heard the crash.

31:22.940 --> 31:23.980
but nobody
saw anything?

31:23.980 --> 31:25.180
apparently not.

31:26.340 --> 31:27.580
morning.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.140
court order
come through yet?

31:29.140 --> 31:30.740
uh, yes, it did.

31:30.740 --> 31:32.060
not that it matters anymore.

31:32.060 --> 31:33.340
why not?
what's going on?

31:33.340 --> 31:34.460
last night,
someone stole a car

31:34.460 --> 31:36.260
and plowed it
into a telephone pole

31:36.260 --> 31:38.140
a few blocks
from warren trask's house.

31:38.140 --> 31:39.900
blacked out
the entire neighborhood.

31:39.900 --> 31:41.220
life support system shut down.

31:41.220 --> 31:42.540
it ran on battery power
for a while,

31:42.540 --> 31:43.900
but we had his daughter's
cell phone jammed.

31:43.900 --> 31:46.260
by the time she got
to a phone that worked--

31:46.260 --> 31:47.420
trask's dead?

31:47.420 --> 31:50.540
try not to sound
so broken up about it.

31:50.540 --> 31:53.340
i'm just surprised, that's all.

31:53.340 --> 31:54.540
what about the attacks
on ubient?

31:54.540 --> 31:55.780
as of this morning,

31:55.780 --> 31:56.820
ubient software
is running virus-free.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.660
seems imroth's company
is going to survive,

31:58.660 --> 32:00.900
and so's the economy.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.860
stock market's
already up 200 points.

32:03.860 --> 32:06.420
weird way for things
to work out,

32:06.420 --> 32:07.460
but i guess
we'll take it.

32:07.460 --> 32:08.620
yeah, we all
got lucky,

32:08.620 --> 32:09.740
except for
warren trask.

32:09.740 --> 32:10.700
yeah.

32:10.700 --> 32:11.660
what happened
to your head?

32:11.660 --> 32:12.740
hmm?

32:12.740 --> 32:15.420
oh, i banged it
on the medicine cabinet

32:15.420 --> 32:16.620
in the middle
of the night.

32:16.620 --> 32:17.820
next time,
i'll turn on the light.

32:17.820 --> 32:19.540
good idea.

32:21.260 --> 32:22.420
you have
five minutes, shawn.

32:22.420 --> 32:23.740
tell me what you want.

32:23.740 --> 32:24.780
i want you to release
kevin burkhoff.

32:24.780 --> 32:25.740
don't tell me
he's not here.

32:25.740 --> 32:26.860
dr. burkhoff is here.

32:26.860 --> 32:27.980
he's my guest,

32:27.980 --> 32:29.820
and he'll remain that way
for the time being.

32:29.820 --> 32:32.220
tell me, jordan,
since when did kidnapping

32:32.220 --> 32:34.620
become part of this
new religion of yours?

32:34.620 --> 32:36.140
that seems like
a pretty twisted way

32:36.140 --> 32:37.460
to bring the world
closer to god.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.500
you want to get back
in my good graces, shawn?

32:39.500 --> 32:40.660
it's simple.

32:40.660 --> 32:42.100
hold another press conference,

32:42.100 --> 32:43.420
announce you've had
a change of heart,

32:43.420 --> 32:46.780
and that you now support
the taking of promicin.

32:46.780 --> 32:48.340
you know i can't do that.

32:48.340 --> 32:50.100
then kevin burkhoff
remains my guest,

32:50.100 --> 32:51.460
and you...

32:51.460 --> 32:54.540
you're no longer welcome
in promise city.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.140
goodbye, shawn.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.580
[gasping in pain]

33:32.260 --> 33:34.460
[whistling happily]

33:34.460 --> 33:37.340
how is my girl feeling?

33:37.340 --> 33:39.020
like i'm going to die.

33:39.020 --> 33:40.340
ah, it's just
your body ridding itself

33:40.340 --> 33:42.980
of the anti-promicin
allergens.

33:42.980 --> 33:45.740
it's all part
of the process.

33:45.740 --> 33:48.340
ah, ah, ah,ah
look this way.

33:48.340 --> 33:49.460
there you go.

33:53.060 --> 33:55.340
now...

33:55.340 --> 33:56.660
it's time for
the next step.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.820
[unzipping case]

34:00.180 --> 34:01.460
[whistling happily]

34:01.460 --> 34:02.540
don't.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.100
no...

34:04.100 --> 34:05.340
shh...

34:05.340 --> 34:06.820
it's okay, isabelle.

34:06.820 --> 34:07.860
in a few seconds,

34:07.860 --> 34:09.460
you are going to feel
a lot better.

34:09.460 --> 34:11.739
no...

34:13.820 --> 34:16.460
you see?
that wasn't so bad.

34:22.580 --> 34:23.900
oh, and, um...

34:23.900 --> 34:26.420
isabelle, i know
what you're thinking.

34:26.420 --> 34:27.380
once your
abilities return,

34:27.380 --> 34:29.179
you're going to
use them against me.

34:29.179 --> 34:33.699
it worked once before
when you murdered matthew ross,

34:33.699 --> 34:35.100
but i wouldn't try it again.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.260
this time, we're not
taking any chances.

34:37.260 --> 34:38.500
we placed a deterrent
inside you

34:38.500 --> 34:39.780
while you were in prison.

34:39.780 --> 34:41.380
call it a, uh...

34:41.380 --> 34:42.620
kill switch.

34:42.620 --> 34:45.179
if you move against me,

34:45.179 --> 34:46.860
or disobey me in any way,

34:46.860 --> 34:48.940
it will be activated,
and you will die.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.219
[chuckles]

34:54.219 --> 34:59.700
now, you just rest
for another hour or so,

34:59.700 --> 35:01.420
and when you get up,

35:01.420 --> 35:04.780
you'll be the most
powerful person on the planet...

35:04.780 --> 35:06.620
again.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.640
well, i'm just going to
finish up here.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.000
you two have a good night.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.040
yeah, you too.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.440
good night.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.880
oh, i have to say,
you did wonderful work.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.920
with trask
out of the way,

35:35.920 --> 35:38.800
the company
has finally rebounded.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.320
the next two
fiscal quarters

35:40.320 --> 35:41.520
will be shaky at best,

35:41.520 --> 35:44.880
but thanks to you,
ubient livesnt

35:44.880 --> 35:47.040
you're not celebrating.
what's wrong?

35:47.040 --> 35:48.400
one of the last things
trask did

35:48.400 --> 35:49.960
was spread your personal data
all over the internet.

35:49.960 --> 35:54.120
names, phone records,
financial statements.

35:54.120 --> 35:57.440
they're all out there
for all eyes to see,

35:57.440 --> 35:58.920
to study.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.040
it could lead to
some very dangerous questions.

36:01.040 --> 36:04.080
so, we do damage control--

36:04.080 --> 36:06.560
delete all we can
and deny the rest.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.920
that'll only feed
the conspiracy theorists.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.360
so it's been decided, drew.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.920
we're going to have to take
a more radical approach.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.840
what do you have in mind?

36:24.800 --> 36:25.800
hi, mom!

36:25.800 --> 36:27.080
hi, dad!

36:27.080 --> 36:29.760
hello, sweetheart.
did you have a fun birthday?

36:29.760 --> 36:30.920
pretty fun.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.480
i just... wish you
could have been there.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.800
so do we.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.280
i'll bet you got
some nice gifts.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.640
i got a new ipod.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.440
it's like a record player,

36:40.440 --> 36:42.200
only it plays
thousands of songs.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.240
any sinatra?

36:43.240 --> 36:44.480
tons of sinatra.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.560
next time i come,
i'll bring it with me.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.440
are you sure
you can get away?

36:48.440 --> 36:49.880
you know, we wouldn't
want to interfere

36:49.880 --> 36:51.440
with any homework
or anything.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.520
you're not
interfering.

36:53.520 --> 36:57.240
i like coming here
and seeing you.

36:57.240 --> 37:00.040
i wish i could
come every day.

37:00.040 --> 37:02.440
so do we.

37:03.640 --> 37:06.720
jordan's never
going to let kevin go.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.840
so that's it?

37:07.840 --> 37:10.720
the compatibility test
isn't going to happen?

37:10.720 --> 37:12.840
it has to happen.

37:12.840 --> 37:16.520
i have to
make it happen.

37:16.520 --> 37:17.560
get on the phone,

37:17.560 --> 37:19.520
get ahold of tess.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.600
we're taking kevin
out of promise city.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.160
isabelle!

38:02.560 --> 38:03.560
it's all settled.

38:03.560 --> 38:06.040
he understands
what he has to do.

38:06.040 --> 38:08.440
he may have been
a little disappointed at first.

38:08.440 --> 38:09.960
after all, he had a good run,

38:09.960 --> 38:12.200
<i>but in the end,
he took it well.</i>

38:12.200 --> 38:14.680
<i>he knows it's time to move on.</i>

38:14.680 --> 38:16.320
<i>i'm sure he considers it
an honor...</i>

38:16.320 --> 38:18.160
especially after he heard about

38:18.160 --> 38:19.760
the new host
we have lined up for him.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.360
<i>he made an excellent
drew imroth,</i>

38:25.360 --> 38:28.080
but he'll make an even better
jordan collier.
