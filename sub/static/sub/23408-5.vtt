00:06.400 --> 00:08.760
Father, I lied to you.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.640
Islene's...

00:09.680 --> 00:11.320
Islene's dead.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.520
Where are you, my gods?

00:13.560 --> 00:17.200
Where... are... my... gods?

00:17.240 --> 00:18.160
When I was cold,

00:18.200 --> 00:19.480
you kept me warm.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.320
When I wept,
you comforted me.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.400
I will protect you.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.520
I will protect you.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.520
Have you spoken
to them yet?

00:27.560 --> 00:28.560
Who?

00:28.600 --> 00:29.880
The Druids. You
need their blessing.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.240
You are a monster.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.680
Well, if you won't
speak with them,

00:32.720 --> 00:33.600
I will.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.800
If you knew who I was,

00:35.840 --> 00:37.920
you would not
be here.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.520
My plans... have changed.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.400
Since when?

00:40.440 --> 00:41.760
Since I saw the General.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.880
Since I looked
in his eyes.

00:42.920 --> 00:43.840
He's not a man.

00:43.880 --> 00:44.840
He's something else,

00:44.880 --> 00:46.400
something
far, far stronger.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.840
Behold the power of Rome!

00:50.360 --> 00:53.720
Behold the power of Rome!

00:56.400 --> 01:00.440
You are Queen Kerra
of the Cantii.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.840
The scariest thing,

01:01.880 --> 01:03.000
your biggest fear...

01:03.040 --> 01:08.160
his name
is Aulus Plautius.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074

02:14.040 --> 02:16.400
Pellenor is dead.

02:16.440 --> 02:20.360
His daughter
is to be crowned queen.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.520
Well, that's handy.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.200
What's all this, then?

02:29.600 --> 02:32.440
I'd say calculations.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.080
I thought the Celts
didn't write anything down.

02:34.120 --> 02:37.560
They don't.
These are the gods'.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.240
The gods wrote these.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.920
Well, that explains it.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.600
What's that?

02:53.880 --> 02:55.880
A message...

02:55.920 --> 02:57.560
to an old friend.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.640
Ye Gods...

05:35.920 --> 05:37.720
With these new eyes,

05:37.760 --> 05:40.040
he can see further
than the hawk.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.360
He sees the beginning of time.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.040
Does he see you?

06:15.080 --> 06:18.000
He can see
everything now,

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
but not with these.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.600
Now, these are
for the crows.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.880
A span of oak
will give our king strength

06:40.920 --> 06:42.880
on his journey
to the underworld.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.400
When will the Queen
be crowned?

06:45.440 --> 06:48.560
She has until sunset
to make her choice.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.960
What if
she says no?

06:53.600 --> 06:54.640
Then she defies the gods...

06:57.400 --> 06:59.240
and the crows will feast
for days.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.880
My Queen.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.440
The Druids are fiends.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.160
They don't speak for the gods.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.360
They feed their own needs
and ambitions.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.600
Gods...

08:24.640 --> 08:26.440
Veran's the devil
himself.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.000
Send for the Roman general.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.640
Let us make peace
with the spirits of the past.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.640
As one cycle ends,

09:03.680 --> 09:05.880
so the next begins.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.640
Bit early.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.920
Go to hell.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.160
Did you see her face?

09:37.560 --> 09:40.120
She can barely keep
from grinning.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.320
Don't be ridiculous.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.320
You think this wasn't
her plan all along?

09:46.200 --> 09:48.080
Why do you think
she went to the Romans?

09:48.120 --> 09:50.720
She betrayed your father,

09:50.760 --> 09:53.400
and you stood by
and did nothing.

09:53.440 --> 09:57.080
If you hadn't been
so pathetic,

09:57.120 --> 09:59.800
your father
would have seen sense.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.520
He would still be alive,

10:01.560 --> 10:04.600
and when he died,
you would be king,

10:04.640 --> 10:05.640
but no...

10:05.680 --> 10:09.560
you didn't dare
even speak with them.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.440
You appall me.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.320
There is nowhere
in this whole world

10:17.360 --> 10:19.960
such weakness,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.240
such craven, lily-livered...

10:24.400 --> 10:25.800
Fuck...

10:38.200 --> 10:39.800
Fuck you!

10:43.360 --> 10:44.360
Come on.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.000
Come on!

10:46.040 --> 10:47.520
Your Regni whore is miles away.

10:47.560 --> 10:48.960
Why don't you do it?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.240
Do it...

10:50.280 --> 10:51.920
or are you too weak
even for that now?

10:51.960 --> 10:53.480
Come on.
Come on...

10:53.520 --> 10:55.920
Fuck me!

10:55.960 --> 10:58.720
Come on.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.520
Yeah, that's it.
Fuck me.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.520
What a surprise.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.960
All talk, and no action.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.400
I've got an idea.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.360
Why don't you go and try
and fuck your sister?

11:34.400 --> 11:35.800
Hmm?

11:35.840 --> 11:37.960
Maybe then
you can get it up.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.000
Come on.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.400
Come on...

11:42.440 --> 11:45.320
Give it a go, mm?

11:45.360 --> 11:46.200
Hmm?

11:46.240 --> 11:49.480
Maybe the Druids
would like it.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.640
Come on.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.680
Come on!

11:54.320 --> 11:56.440
Go and stick it
up the Queen.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.800
I swear,
if I had a cock,

11:57.840 --> 11:59.800
that's what I'd be doing
right now.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.040
Oh, god, look at you.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.520
You're more
woman than man!

12:07.640 --> 12:10.520
So clever.
So wise.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.200
Where has it all
got you?

12:12.240 --> 12:14.240
You're not a king.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.360
You're not a husband.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.080
You're nothing.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.240
Hey...

12:58.280 --> 12:59.680
It's all right.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.120
It's not all right.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.160
Nothing's right.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.080
It should be you.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.360
Who knows the ways of the gods?

13:14.760 --> 13:16.800
You know
I don't want this.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.280
I don't want any of it.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.520
Not...

13:28.560 --> 13:30.480
not any of it?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.200
What do you mean?

13:40.480 --> 13:41.880
Something's, uh...

13:41.920 --> 13:44.160
something's bothering me.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.760
When we left the citadel,

13:48.800 --> 13:52.160
the Roman prisoner,
he was shouting something.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.120
Did you hear
what it was?

13:53.160 --> 13:54.000
No.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.640
No? I did.

13:55.680 --> 13:59.400
He was shouting
"Behold the power of Rome."

14:00.680 --> 14:02.240
Mm?

14:04.440 --> 14:07.200
And they were watching us
last night,

14:07.240 --> 14:10.360
just like it was...
planned.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.000
I swear by our mother,

14:14.040 --> 14:17.600
I never saw any
of this coming.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.000
All my life, I thought
it was going to be you,

14:20.040 --> 14:23.400
that you were going
to rule us.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.800
All of which
begs the question...

14:27.840 --> 14:30.040
why did they choose you?

14:35.200 --> 14:36.200
Where are you going?

14:39.040 --> 14:42.280
Back to the citadel.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.800
There's one more question
I need to ask our Roman friend.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.320
How is she?

16:12.360 --> 16:14.000
The Queen?

16:15.280 --> 16:16.360
You're drunk.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.600
What happened?

16:19.640 --> 16:21.560
Did Phelan catch you at it?

16:23.240 --> 16:24.440
You should be careful.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.520
You might make him jealous.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.000
What did you say?

16:29.040 --> 16:30.840
They've been at it
for years.

16:30.880 --> 16:31.800
Of course, they deny it...

16:33.280 --> 16:35.440
but all the signs are there.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.040
The number of times
he's come to my bed

16:40.080 --> 16:41.680
reeking of her.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.600
You must have
spotted it...

16:44.640 --> 16:47.440
little smiles,
whispers,

16:47.480 --> 16:50.560
cosy asides...

16:50.600 --> 16:52.040
and now that she's queen,

16:52.080 --> 16:55.000
what's not to like, eh?

16:55.040 --> 16:56.400
And let's face it,
you should know.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.040
Shut your mouth.

16:59.480 --> 17:02.120
How you must wish

17:02.160 --> 17:05.119
that the Druids
had put you with her.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.599
Tell me, husband...

17:10.200 --> 17:12.520
is she better than me?

17:12.560 --> 17:15.680
Is her mouth prettier?

17:15.720 --> 17:16.920
Did she make you sweat?

17:16.960 --> 17:17.960
Shut up.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.839
Am I not enough for you?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.560
Am I not beautiful?

17:30.600 --> 17:33.000
You took me for your wife.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.280
You looked me in the eye,
and you swore an oath.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.440
Answer me.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.960
You are beautiful...

17:46.560 --> 17:48.000
on the outside.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.080
Get out.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.720
State your business!

18:21.760 --> 18:25.800
General Aulus is here
to speak with Queen Antedia.

18:25.840 --> 18:26.800
Open the gate!

18:54.840 --> 18:57.960
So, Kerra
is to be crowned queen.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.240
That is what the gods will.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.320
The woman who mutilated
my only son...

19:04.360 --> 19:06.000
who destroyed my dynasty.

19:06.040 --> 19:09.040
In her lies the future.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.080
I'm not here

19:10.120 --> 19:11.000
to explain the ways
of the Druids

19:11.040 --> 19:12.240
or the gods.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.280
I'm here to win a war.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.760
Are we on the same side
in that war?

19:16.800 --> 19:17.800
You tell me.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.520
We have a spy
inside the Cantii citadel.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.240
Now, this spy tells me

19:27.280 --> 19:29.680
Kerra came
to see you, alone,

19:29.720 --> 19:30.600
and that you spoke...

19:30.640 --> 19:31.800
And after you talked,

19:31.840 --> 19:34.320
you ceased
crucifying her people.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.160
What deal
did you make with her?

19:35.200 --> 19:37.680
That is indeed the question,

19:37.720 --> 19:38.720
because
if there was such a deal,

19:38.760 --> 19:40.160
and I don't know about it,

19:40.200 --> 19:43.240
then before you can bellow
"Hail Claudius,"

19:43.280 --> 19:45.200
your pretty head,
and your friend's here,

19:45.240 --> 19:48.000
are decorating my gates.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.480
Who is this spy?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.920
This is
all my fault.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.280
I should never have
disobeyed my King.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.280
I should never
have gone to them.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.600
You did what your
heart told you,

20:17.640 --> 20:19.120
as you should do now.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.880
Hey...

20:23.000 --> 20:25.080
Come with me.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.880
We take two horses,
and we flee now.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.560
There's nothing in this world
I want more.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.840
Then do it.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.680
Staying here
is certain death.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.080
I need to speak with Veran.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.760
Veran is a devil.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.040
I need to look him in the eye.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.960
I need to know
the truth.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.520
If you look him in the eye,
he will steal your mind.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.720
It will no longer
be your own.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.520
I must speak with him.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.680
Then you'll have your answer.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.760
Your spy speaks the truth.
We met with the Cantii.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.480
What was the agreement?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.760
She said she would
speak to her father,

21:13.800 --> 21:15.160
that she had his ear.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.560
Turns out
she was mistaken,

21:16.600 --> 21:19.360
'cause when he found out,
he called in the Druids.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.400
We speak to all the tribes.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.600
It's what we do.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.080
Now, we have
mutual interests,

21:26.120 --> 21:27.080
and you'd better hope

21:27.120 --> 21:28.400
that continues
to be the case.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.240
Now, are we on the same side,
or aren't we?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.520
If we are,

21:35.560 --> 21:37.160
I want more
than mutual interest.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.080
You see,
I trust my allies.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.160
I respect them.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.880
I want to know
if I have your trust,

21:43.920 --> 21:45.600
your respect, your...

21:47.320 --> 21:48.520
love.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.520
To prove it,

21:51.560 --> 21:53.640
I want you
to do something for me.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.160
What do you want?

22:00.200 --> 22:03.560
I want you to kneel down

22:03.600 --> 22:05.320
and kiss my feet.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.960
Kiss your feet?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.800
That's right.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.520
It's something
I like my allies to do.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.160
Just kneel down there,

22:20.200 --> 22:21.840
and kiss them.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.080
Kiss my feet.

22:26.120 --> 22:27.960
And if I refuse?

22:45.360 --> 22:46.680
Well...

22:49.280 --> 22:51.680
in that case...

22:55.840 --> 22:56.960
I refuse.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.760
You refuse?

23:00.800 --> 23:01.960
Absolutely.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.640
I refuse
to kiss your feet...

23:06.320 --> 23:09.440
but I will kiss
your lovely hand...

23:10.760 --> 23:12.760
to show trust...

23:12.800 --> 23:15.000
respect...

23:17.480 --> 23:18.520
love.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.560
There.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.200
Are we satisfied?

23:40.960 --> 23:41.840
He has to kiss my feet.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.160
Well, go on, then.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.600
Come on, man.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.680
What are you waiting for?

24:15.440 --> 24:16.440
And the other one.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.400
You should know

24:35.440 --> 24:36.520
my mother's
not to be messed with.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.320
Thanks for the advice,

24:38.360 --> 24:41.640
but I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.080
Besides, we like
your mum.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.680
She's got balls.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.240
If the Regni
will lay siege to Crugdunon,

24:49.280 --> 24:50.360
they will do so

24:50.400 --> 24:52.000
with the full support
of the Emperor.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.320
Their population
will be enslaved,

24:54.360 --> 24:55.880
their weak and elderly
put to the sword,

24:55.920 --> 24:57.880
and when you are
on their throne,

24:57.920 --> 24:59.560
that's when you and I
will talk.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.080
There's something
else I want.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.920
I thought there might be.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.680
What is it?

25:10.720 --> 25:13.560
The Druids call themselves
the mouthpieces of the gods,

25:13.600 --> 25:15.280
vessels of the divine,

25:15.320 --> 25:18.440
but really...

25:18.480 --> 25:19.480
they're just whores.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.160
I thought your tribe
worshipped the Druids,

25:23.200 --> 25:24.920
that their word was law.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.640
Once we did.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.720
Not anymore.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.600
I see.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.000
So what do you want?

25:39.480 --> 25:42.520
The head of Veran...

25:42.560 --> 25:45.040
on a nice big stick.

25:45.080 --> 25:50.320
It would certainly add
to the trust, respect, and love

25:50.360 --> 25:51.560
we have forged here today.

25:54.080 --> 25:57.120
You can do that for me,
can't you?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.880
You leave it to me.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.040
Do you trust him?

26:26.440 --> 26:28.720
Not as far as I
could shit him.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.480
You won't get any
answers out of him.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.520
Quane.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.400
My eyes fade,

27:21.440 --> 27:25.040
but you,
I can see clearly.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.280
Sit, old friend.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.320
You know
as well as I

27:33.360 --> 27:36.320
you shouldn't be here.

27:36.360 --> 27:39.880
This rock
is not your home anymore.

27:39.920 --> 27:40.880
It is death to you now.

27:40.920 --> 27:41.920
Quane...

27:43.040 --> 27:44.760
Where is everyone?

27:44.800 --> 27:47.160
Where's Willa?
Where's Veran?

27:47.200 --> 27:50.080
They went to Crugdunon,
to the citadel.

27:50.120 --> 27:53.760
The King's daughter has...
betrayed her people,

27:53.800 --> 27:55.480
or something.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.920
Quane...

27:56.960 --> 27:59.040
I need to speak to Veran.

27:59.080 --> 27:59.960
Why?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.600
Lokka himself...

28:03.640 --> 28:04.760
is here.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.000
Have you seen him?

28:10.040 --> 28:12.080
Yes.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.840
He came to find me.

28:13.880 --> 28:14.920
He left me a warning.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.200
You shouldn't have come here.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.680
If Lokka is here,
then Veran must know.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.360
You don't
understand, child.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.840
If Lokka is here,

28:26.880 --> 28:28.600
Veran knows.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.720
Veran was born
ten thousand years ago.

28:37.760 --> 28:40.080
He was the second man.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.360
His brother, Harka,
was the first.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.080
They were born
from the Oak Tree,

28:49.120 --> 28:51.880
and the tree protected them.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.240
They would sit high in the Oak

28:54.280 --> 28:57.320
and talk of all the wonders
in the world...

28:57.360 --> 28:59.240
the birds...
the caterpillars...

29:00.680 --> 29:02.720
the light on the leaves.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.600
Then one day, Veran came home

29:04.640 --> 29:08.000
and found Harka
hanging from the Oak Tree,

29:08.040 --> 29:11.160
and Veran wept.

29:11.200 --> 29:15.480
He knew then his brother
wasn't strong enough...

29:15.520 --> 29:19.720
strong enough for the Wonder...

29:19.760 --> 29:22.240
but then,
Veran saw the rope move,

29:22.280 --> 29:25.240
and he saw
the rope was alive.

29:25.280 --> 29:29.560
It was a serpent,
sent by Lokka himself,

29:29.600 --> 29:33.360
and the serpent's name
was Pwykka.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.880
Veran taught you
everything he knew.

29:43.920 --> 29:47.200
You were his favourite,

29:47.240 --> 29:49.600
but you betrayed him.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.560
I didn't betray him.

29:52.600 --> 29:53.840
Pwykka tricked me.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.040
If Lokka is here,

29:55.080 --> 29:56.360
Pwykka won't be
far behind...

29:58.720 --> 30:01.880
and the age of Wonder
is at an end.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.120
Are you
looking for someone?

30:13.440 --> 30:15.840
I seek the mighty Veran.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.920
I'll do whatever he wants.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.360
I'm ready.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.640
Are you sure?

30:22.680 --> 30:26.120
You heard me, you ugly bitch.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.360
I'm ready!

30:28.400 --> 30:30.320
Then come inside.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.480
Follow me, child.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.760
Where is he?

31:05.800 --> 31:09.960
First we must discover
how ready you are.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.200
I am ready.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.040
I am ready.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.840
Sit.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.600
What do you see
when you look at me?

32:12.920 --> 32:16.320
When I look at you,
I see darkness...

32:16.360 --> 32:19.520
darkness and lies.

32:19.560 --> 32:20.560
So I'm a liar?

32:22.760 --> 32:25.120
I know Rome came to you.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.080
They made a deal.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.480
They knew they couldn't
deal with my father,

32:29.520 --> 32:30.520
so you did
their bidding.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.920
You killed my father

32:34.960 --> 32:37.240
not because
the gods told you to,

32:37.280 --> 32:38.720
but to save
yourself.

32:38.760 --> 32:43.160
Many think they can influence
the ruling of the gods.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.000
The gods' voice is the wind...

32:46.040 --> 32:47.520
the earthquake...

32:47.560 --> 32:48.600
the famine.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.320
But you're not the wind.

32:52.480 --> 32:53.480
You're human.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.880
What's the difference?

33:10.800 --> 33:14.880
There is something
I need to tell you.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.920
The Roman General
came here.

33:16.960 --> 33:17.880
When?

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
Soon after the
Romans landed,

33:19.960 --> 33:21.960
and Veran...

33:22.000 --> 33:25.280
took him
to the Underworld.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.400
No, no, no, no.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.040
If he risked
travelling to the Underworld,

33:30.080 --> 33:31.960
to walk among our dead,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.160
then...

33:36.120 --> 33:38.160
he went
to find something important.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.600
Follow his footsteps.

33:39.640 --> 33:42.640
Only then will you know
what it is he seeks...

33:45.440 --> 33:46.680
and what might save us.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.880
Romans are demons...

34:22.920 --> 34:26.000
foot soldiers for
the great Earth Demon Lokka.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.239
They come in disguise,

34:27.280 --> 34:31.159
pretending to bring
protection, bounty,

34:31.199 --> 34:34.280
but in truth, they bring
only chaos and destruction.

34:34.320 --> 34:37.560
Yes, Rome came to me,

34:37.600 --> 34:38.880
and I listened.

34:38.920 --> 34:42.560
They thought
you would be wiser,

34:42.600 --> 34:44.719
asked me
to sacrifice your father

34:44.760 --> 34:46.040
and replace him
with you.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.679
And that's exactly
what you did.

34:47.719 --> 34:48.800
Indeed...

34:48.840 --> 34:52.560
but that's not
why your father is gone.

34:54.239 --> 34:55.080
Then why?

34:56.960 --> 34:58.440
This day,

34:58.480 --> 35:00.800
Lokka believes the Druids
have done his bidding,

35:00.840 --> 35:03.600
but Lokka is wrong.

35:03.640 --> 35:07.600
The gods would not choose you
for such a reason,

35:07.640 --> 35:09.760
for the gods cannot be bought.

35:11.320 --> 35:12.800
The gods chose you

35:12.840 --> 35:13.960
because the gods know

35:14.000 --> 35:16.800
you are strong enough
to defeat Lokka,

35:16.840 --> 35:18.520
and to do that,

35:18.560 --> 35:21.680
you have to be prepared
to sacrifice everything.

35:40.720 --> 35:41.720
What did he say?

35:46.600 --> 35:48.120
Kerra...

35:48.160 --> 35:49.400
what did he
say to you?

35:49.440 --> 35:51.960
Have you decided?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.520
I have.

35:53.560 --> 35:54.800
So?

35:57.600 --> 36:00.440
I will become Queen.

36:00.480 --> 36:03.320
I will rule my people.

38:57.120 --> 39:00.160
Before the gods, there was
nothing but chaos.

39:00.200 --> 39:04.840
Now we stand held
under their unyielding gaze...

39:04.880 --> 39:08.800
below the cold moon,
beneath the stars.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.520
I have one question.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.960
Did your general
ever meet with the Druids?

39:30.240 --> 39:31.600
Child of the Night...

39:32.560 --> 39:36.280
Sword of the Gods, I crown you.

39:36.320 --> 39:40.680
May you never speak again,
except to show us the way.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.400
Do you feel
the gods' pleasure?

39:45.440 --> 39:46.840
I do.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.640
Then rise up,
Queen Kerra.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.880
Queen Kerra.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.040
Queen Kerra.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.640
Get your stuff.
We're leaving.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.920
It's a mistake.

40:39.200 --> 40:42.800
Then it's my mistake.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.000
I've made plenty of others.

40:46.120 --> 40:49.440
You must go
to Amena now.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.280
She needs you.

40:54.960 --> 40:57.640
I'm sorry, Lindon.

40:57.680 --> 40:58.880
This is the gods' will.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.080
What has he done to you?

41:01.120 --> 41:03.400
This is what
the Druids decreed.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.000
Listen to yourself.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.720
You walk into that circle
as one thing,

41:07.760 --> 41:08.720
and you return saying this?

41:08.760 --> 41:11.840
You will do as I command.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.440
The night
they took my mother away,

41:55.480 --> 41:57.760
you wrote something.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.640
Here.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.120
What does it say?

42:03.160 --> 42:05.600
Those words are from the gods.

42:07.640 --> 42:09.600
Not until the day
you leave this world

42:09.640 --> 42:10.800
can they be read.

42:10.840 --> 42:11.840
Read them to me.

42:14.160 --> 42:17.040
If I am to trust you...

42:17.080 --> 42:18.240
I need to know.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.400
Trust is
not important.

42:19.440 --> 42:21.080
Only faith.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.160
If I am
the Sword of the Gods,

42:29.200 --> 42:30.760
you will read me the runes.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.360
How will you know
I'm telling you the truth?

42:38.000 --> 42:39.960
I'll know.

42:53.920 --> 42:55.800
These words...
they say,

42:55.840 --> 42:59.120
"Hope is the daughter
of a blind father."

43:33.920 --> 43:35.760
Here, father.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.280
Thank you,
my child.
