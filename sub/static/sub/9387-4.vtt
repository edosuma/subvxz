WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.963
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.047 --> 00:08.133
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.217 --> 00:11.887
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.970 --> 00:14.890
On which we used to rely?

00:15.015 --> 00:18.227
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.310 --> 00:21.563
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.647 --> 00:23.106
All the things that make us

00:23.190 --> 00:24.900
Laugh and cry...

00:24.983 --> 00:30.113
He's... A... Fam...
ily... Guy!

00:34.284 --> 00:36.161
All right, kids,
assembly is starting.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.830
Now please take your seats
for the following presentation

00:38.914 --> 00:39.998
by the U.S. Army.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.834
CHRIS (groaning):
Oh...

00:42.000 --> 00:45.170
(loud techno music plays)

00:45.254 --> 00:46.296
What's up, y'all?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.756
I'm Sergeant Extreme!

00:47.881 --> 00:49.174
And I'm Major Awesome!

00:49.258 --> 00:52.803
We're here to tell you how
much the army kicks ass!

00:52.886 --> 00:54.096
Check this out!

00:56.348 --> 00:58.892
(rock music plays)

01:21.790 --> 01:23.500
The army sounds awesome!

01:23.584 --> 01:25.627
And the recruiter
said with any luck,

01:25.711 --> 01:28.547
-I could the clap from a 12-year-old
-Chinese prostitute.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.966
Wow, that's great--
you'll be serving your country,

01:31.049 --> 01:33.343
just like American
film legend Mickey Rooney.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.346
Hi. I'm former biggest star
in the world, Mickey Rooney.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.933
And as you may know, I am
totally and completely insane.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.311
I like to yell at mice
with my shirt off.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.439
(yelling)

01:45.522 --> 01:47.941
Sometimes I like to steal
other people's scabs.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.943
(yelling)

01:50.027 --> 01:51.528
(continues yelling)

01:51.612 --> 01:53.197
How do I stay so crazy?

01:53.280 --> 01:54.740
Mickey Rooney's Crazy Pills!

01:54.823 --> 01:56.783
Take one with breakfast,
one with lunch,

01:56.867 --> 01:59.119
and before you know it,
you'll be up on your roof;

01:59.203 --> 02:00.537
pooping in the chimney.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.915
Hold out your stockings, kids!

02:03.040 --> 02:05.918
Chris, you can't
join the army-- you're too young.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.669
Besides, the
army is weak.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.797
Now, the marines, those are the men
you want to (bleep).

02:10.923 --> 02:12.883
Are you kidding, Lois?
The army's great!

02:13.050 --> 02:14.510
You get to save money
for college,

02:14.593 --> 02:18.430
there's free food, and all
the brown people you can rape.

02:18.597 --> 02:22.226
I am sorry, but he
is not joining the army-- case closed.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.353
I can't believe they're
brainwashing kids like Chris

02:24.436 --> 02:25.812
to serve in the military.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.481
Ah, yes,
the bottom ten percent

02:27.564 --> 02:29.358
of our high school class
is off to fight another battle.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.443
-You stole that from The Onion.
-What?

02:31.527 --> 02:33.362
You stole that-- I read
that in The Onion.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.656
About the war in Iraq.
Well, if that's true, then I'd say

02:35.739 --> 02:37.449
they've got some sharp cookies
over at the, uh...

02:37.574 --> 02:39.034
Wh-What is it again?
The Onion?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.911
So if I go up to
your room right now,

02:40.994 --> 02:42.621
I'm not gonna find a
copy of The Onion, right?

02:42.704 --> 02:44.039
No.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.792
Ow! Damn it!
That's what I thought.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.921
TV ANNOUNCER:
Coming this fall,

02:51.004 --> 02:52.673
if you loved
Everybody Loves Raymond,

02:52.756 --> 02:55.175
then you'll love his brother,
Robert, even more,

02:55.259 --> 02:56.593
in Robert.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.971
I bet you Debra really
gave it to Ray today.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.390
I bet you she made a sandwich
that wasn't very good,

03:01.515 --> 03:03.433
but he ate it anyway.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.395
And then she got mad at him
'cause he gave her a funny look.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.896
I miss Ray.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.816
(groaning):
Aw...

03:10.899 --> 03:12.901
I can't believe Chris
would just buy into

03:12.985 --> 03:14.319
that army recruiter's
sales pitch.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.988
We can't let him enlist.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.698
Don't worry, Lois,
all he needs is

03:17.781 --> 03:19.867
an after-school activity
to get his mind off the army.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.076
Just something
to distract him.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.287
You know, like all
of America gets distracted

03:23.370 --> 03:25.122
whenever a cute
white girl dies.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.291
We regret to report
that not all the children

03:27.374 --> 03:29.209
onboard the school bus
survived.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.378
We have identified
the body of one victim,

03:31.461 --> 03:32.921
nine-year-old
Becky Gunderson.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.131
ALL:
Aw...

03:34.214 --> 03:36.383
No, wait, that's, uh,
Becky Gutierrez.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.510
-ALL: Oh.
-That's not news.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.557
B-Brian, wha...
what are you doing?

03:43.640 --> 03:44.683
Gymboree is that way.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.894
Brian, it's parachute day!

03:46.977 --> 03:48.729
I just want to swing by
the army recruiting center

03:48.812 --> 03:50.272
and give a piece of
my mind to that jerk

03:50.355 --> 03:51.857
who tried to
brainwash Chris.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.066
We are gonna be so late.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.068
I'm not gonna have a partner--
I'm gonna have

03:55.152 --> 03:57.279
to be partners
with the teacher. It's just wrong

03:57.362 --> 03:59.114
for the military to mess
with kids' minds.

03:59.198 --> 04:01.575
They're all gonna wind up
in therapy, like Peter was.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.660
Every time my daughter opens
her mouth, I just want

04:03.744 --> 04:05.454
to punch her in the face--
she's really annoying.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.039
Uh-huh. All right,
let's explore that.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.415
What the hell's
wrong with you?

04:08.498 --> 04:10.125
Your skin's, like, moving
around or something.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.169
I believe I'm having
some sort of seizure.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.133
What kind of after-school
activity should I do, Dad?

04:18.217 --> 04:20.302
-Well, Chris, there's a lot of fun
-activities out there.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.429
For example, I used to
be a horse whisperer.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.599
(whispering inaudibly)

04:25.682 --> 04:27.100
Pfft, maybe if she
spent some time

04:27.184 --> 04:29.311
on the treadmill
and I was drunk.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.562
(laughter)

04:30.646 --> 04:31.980
I wouldn't, either.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.400
I don't think any of this stuff
is right for me, Dad.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.819
Let's just face it--
I suck!

04:37.903 --> 04:38.946
(rock music playing)

04:40.405 --> 04:43.033
-PETER: Sounds like you guys
-could use some fresh blood.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.077
This is my son, Chris--
you should hear his voice.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.495
It's absolutely gorgeous.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.081
Like Laura Dern if she
didn't look like a banana.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.249
He can sing?

04:50.332 --> 04:52.376
Yeah, runs in the
family. See, look.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.671
I am Peter Griffin,
I like fancy food

04:55.754 --> 04:58.715
I like reading comic books
and dressing like a dude.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.050
Yeah, rock and roll!

05:00.133 --> 05:02.052
(screams)

05:02.135 --> 05:03.512
(screaming continues)

05:03.595 --> 05:04.805
Did you hear that?

05:04.888 --> 05:07.140
Guys, I think we just found
our new lead singer.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.810
Awesome! I'm gonna be
a famous music star,

05:09.893 --> 05:11.395
like Muddy Waters!

05:11.478 --> 05:12.771
Muddy? Baby?

05:12.855 --> 05:14.147
Everything all right in there?

05:14.231 --> 05:17.317
-MUDDY (groaning): Oh, I think I'm about
-to pass a kidney stone.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.111
(playing blues riff)

05:19.194 --> 05:20.904
(screams)

05:20.988 --> 05:22.281
(playing blues riff)

05:22.364 --> 05:24.283
(screams)

05:24.366 --> 05:26.243
(playing blues riff)

05:26.326 --> 05:28.328
(screams)

05:34.459 --> 05:36.378
Boy, I can't wait
to lay into that recruiter.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.005
Yes, you'll be
about as effective

05:38.088 --> 05:40.007
as the Wizard of Oz was
at granting wishes.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.884
And, Dorothy,
you wanted herpes,

05:41.967 --> 05:44.928
but little did you know,
you've had herpes all along.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.513
I didn't want herpes!

05:46.597 --> 05:47.973
Oh.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.642
Well...
you've got it.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.811
Yes, uh, I'd like to see
the army recruiter.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.105
-Oh, you'll have to have a seat-- there's
-a 25-minute wait.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.524
25 minutes?
Oh, God.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.861
All right, I better go put
more money in the meter.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.323
Peggy, would you send in
the next...

06:04.406 --> 06:05.574
Oh, you're already here.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.868
Say, aren't you a little young
to join the army?

06:07.951 --> 06:11.163
No, I have that, uh...
Webster disease.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.373
Hey, is that the M9
double-action pistol?

06:13.457 --> 06:15.542
Sure is.
Standard issue in the army.

06:15.626 --> 06:16.752
Where do I sign?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.003
Right here.
Did I mention

06:18.128 --> 06:19.880
there's a hundred-dollar bonus
if you sign up a buddy?

06:19.963 --> 06:20.964
Really?

06:21.089 --> 06:23.800
Well, I think I have
a surprise for somebody.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.637
(sighs)
There you are.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.556
Congratulations,
you are both in the army.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.682
We're both
in... What?!

06:30.766 --> 06:31.767
That's ridiculous.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.977
I'll tell you what's
ridiculous-- the Kaiser.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.479
Somebody should put
him on a roll.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.105
Over, we're comin' over

06:37.189 --> 06:39.775
And we won't come back
till it's over over there.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.026
Commercial!

06:41.109 --> 06:42.569
Damn! Play me some
filler, Johnny.

06:42.694 --> 06:46.240
(playing lively
vaudeville music)

06:50.536 --> 06:51.954
Okay, they're dead, all right?

06:52.037 --> 06:54.373
We're not gonna be
seeing them again.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.627
My God!

06:58.710 --> 07:01.964
You are the sorriest bunch
of rejects I ever seen.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.966
And I've seen the Bangles
in concert.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.634
You! Where are
you from, boy?

07:05.717 --> 07:07.010
Quahog.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.097
They only got two things
in Quahog: steers and queers.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.890
I don't see no horns
on you.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.725
What does that
make you, boy?

07:13.809 --> 07:14.852
Queer?
Right!

07:14.935 --> 07:16.103
Oh, I got it?
Yeah.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.814
-(chuckles) You find something funny,
-Private Dancer?

07:18.897 --> 07:20.274
Dancer for money?!

07:20.357 --> 07:21.984
Any old music will do?!

07:22.067 --> 07:23.986
Well, actually, yeah,
your last little, uh,

07:24.069 --> 07:26.572
-back-and-forth there with Stewie, that
-whole queer thing,

07:26.655 --> 07:28.323
that was actually
pretty funny.

07:28.407 --> 07:29.408
Oh, God!

07:29.491 --> 07:30.701
Ooh, that's got to hurt worse

07:30.784 --> 07:34.913
than getting a birthday telegram
from Zinedine Zidane.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.290
Yes?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.917
Bon anniversaire.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.925
Yo, yo, what's up,
James Woods High?!

07:47.009 --> 07:51.096
I'm Chris, and this is our band,
Splash Log!

07:51.180 --> 07:53.891
And we are gonna rock
this place until...

07:53.974 --> 07:55.893
un... well, until about 9:30,

07:55.976 --> 07:58.061
'cause that's when
the dance is over!

08:00.189 --> 08:01.815
Evil monkey

08:01.899 --> 08:03.233
Holds the key

08:03.317 --> 08:05.903
Evil Monkey's gonna get me

08:05.986 --> 08:08.822
I'm hiding underneath my seat
for fear he'll point

08:08.906 --> 08:11.200
(screeching):
And show his teeth!

08:11.283 --> 08:14.453
Evil, evil monkey

08:14.536 --> 08:17.581
Evil, evil monkey

08:17.664 --> 08:19.541
Evil, evil monkey

08:19.625 --> 08:21.043
(screeching yell)

08:22.252 --> 08:23.337
Aah!

08:24.505 --> 08:26.131
Mayor West?

08:26.215 --> 08:29.134
Quiet, young man-- can't you see
we're having a poker game?

08:29.218 --> 08:30.969
Now, I'll ask again.

08:31.053 --> 08:34.097
If I order a pizza, will
anyone else have some?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.225
I might have a slice.
Well, you know,

08:36.308 --> 08:39.019
I'm gonna need more of a
commitment than that, Mark.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.106
-(shouting cadence):West Side Story,
-Anything Goes

08:43.190 --> 08:44.942
-RECRUITS:West Side Story,
-Anything Goes

08:45.025 --> 08:47.069
Two of my favorite
Broadway shows

08:47.152 --> 08:49.196
Two of my favorite
Broadway shows

08:49.279 --> 08:51.323
Miss Saigon
and Cabaret

08:51.406 --> 08:53.492
Miss Saigon and Cabaret

08:53.575 --> 08:55.619
Overrated,
I should say

08:55.702 --> 08:57.663
Overrated, I should say

08:57.746 --> 08:59.957
One, two,
three, four

09:00.040 --> 09:03.085
(lively mambo music plays)

09:05.337 --> 09:07.339
ALL:
Mambo!

09:12.177 --> 09:15.097
(panting, groaning)

09:15.180 --> 09:17.224
Griffin! You got
four legs there!

09:17.307 --> 09:19.184
You better start
using them! I'm trying, sir.

09:19.268 --> 09:22.229
You got five seconds to get
to the head of the pack,

09:22.312 --> 09:24.106
or this entire
platoon is gonna scrub

09:24.189 --> 09:26.108
the latrines with
their toothbrushes.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.151
-Aw, come on, Brian! Don't screw us,
-Griffin!

09:28.235 --> 09:30.237
Yeah, come on,
don't screw us, Brian Griffin!

09:30.320 --> 09:33.115
Bill, how about thinking up
your jeers for a change, huh?

09:33.198 --> 09:36.076
(panting)

09:36.159 --> 09:37.911
(weak grunting)

09:37.995 --> 09:40.622
Four! Three! Two!

09:40.706 --> 09:42.249
Oh, come on, Brian, get up!

09:42.332 --> 09:44.251
Time's up!
You're pathetic, Griffin!

09:44.334 --> 09:46.003
Pathetic!

09:50.674 --> 09:53.343
Whose half-eaten dead bird
is in this footlocker?

09:53.427 --> 09:55.345
Let's say hypothetically
that it does belong

09:55.429 --> 09:56.763
to someone in here.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.849
Would admission of that
allow that person to keep it?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.517
Private Griffin,
just for that,

10:00.601 --> 10:03.770
-you have to listen to one track from this
-Chris Gaines album.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.564
Don't you think
that's a little extreme?

10:05.647 --> 10:08.650
Two tracks! It's so stupid, it's just
Garth Brooks in a wig.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.027
Three tracks!
Come on!

10:10.110 --> 10:12.237
-We can go all day with this!
-Yeah, but...

10:12.321 --> 10:13.739
That's it! Every
single track,

10:13.822 --> 10:15.657
plus the hidden
bonus track!

10:15.782 --> 10:17.159
There's a hidden
bonus track?

10:17.242 --> 10:19.286
Oh, I hope
it's a ballad.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.709
Huh. Should I follow the
knight into the dungeon

10:25.792 --> 10:27.753
or should I go back
the way I came?

10:27.836 --> 10:29.171
Eh, I'll follow
the knight.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.964
Page 37, page 37.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.008
Aah! Aah! I mean, go
back the way I came.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.551
I didn't take my
hand off the page.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.802
You seen it, Lois, right?

10:35.886 --> 10:37.179
You seen my hand
on the page.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.847
Yeah, Peter, I seen it.

10:38.931 --> 10:41.266
(band music playing)
Oh, no, not again.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.852
You know, I'm glad Chris
found an activity he likes,

10:43.936 --> 10:45.854
but why do they have
to use our garage?

10:45.938 --> 10:48.607
Come on, Lois, sometimes
kids can be a handful.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.317
Look at Gregory Peck's kids.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.152
Are we there yet?

10:52.236 --> 10:53.529
It's crowded
back here.

10:53.612 --> 10:54.613
Stop touching me.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.282
Your leg is rubbing
up against mine.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.451
Hey! Quiet down
or I'm pulling over.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.203
Stop breathing
on the window.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.205
You idiot,
that's condensation.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.540
It's on the outside.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.458
That's it! I will
come back there

11:06.542 --> 11:07.626
and, so help me God,

11:07.709 --> 11:09.628
I will hit you
with my ring hand.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.509
(thudding)

11:17.636 --> 11:19.096
What the hell are you doing?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.180
What does it look
like I'm doing?

11:20.305 --> 11:21.515
I'm leaving.
You can't leave, man.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.724
That's desertion.

11:22.808 --> 11:23.851
They'll come after you

11:23.934 --> 11:26.228
like Peter went after
that hockey coach.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.146
Oh, no clip?
Oh, thought we had a clip.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.273
Nope. Okay.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.108
Uh, you can't
leave, Brian.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.192
You'll get life in prison.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.527
I'll take my chances.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.362
Let me ask you this:
when was the last time

11:35.445 --> 11:37.072
you saw something
through to the end?

11:37.155 --> 11:38.699
Well, I, uh...
Never, that's when!

11:38.782 --> 11:39.950
You need this, Brian.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.118
You dropped out of college.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.452
You still haven't
finished your novel.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.288
Do you know what you lack?
Discipline!

11:44.371 --> 11:45.706
And so you know
where you'll get it?

11:45.789 --> 11:46.957
Right here in the army!

11:47.040 --> 11:48.792
Boy, you know what,
you're right.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.085
Everything I've ever done

11:50.169 --> 11:51.753
I've crapped out on
halfway through.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.338
Well, not this time.

11:53.422 --> 11:54.923
I am going to finish
what I started.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.091
That's the spirit!

11:56.175 --> 11:58.010
You can do anything
you put your mind to.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.012
-SOLDIER: You know, it's really
-hard to masturbate

12:00.095 --> 12:01.346
with you guys talking.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.890
SOLDIER #2:
Not for me!

12:02.973 --> 12:06.226
Evil, evil monkey! Ow!

12:06.310 --> 12:08.812
Chris, will you knock
that off for two minutes?

12:08.896 --> 12:10.063
We want to talk to you.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.231
Take five, guys.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.025
What do you
buttheads want?

12:13.108 --> 12:15.068
You've been playing with
your friends long enough.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.446
Now it's time for you to come
inside and do your homework.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.740
It's time for you
to piss off, redhead.

12:19.823 --> 12:20.991
What?!
Hey, hey, Chris,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.534
don't talk to your
mother that way.

12:22.618 --> 12:25.537
Oh, way to stand up for
your woman there, fatty.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.998
Chris, what the hell
is going on with you lately?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.833
Ever since you hooked up
with this band,

12:29.917 --> 12:31.627
you're like a completely
different person,

12:31.710 --> 12:32.920
and I don't like it one bit.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.297
I am expressing myself!

12:35.380 --> 12:37.049
Now, get out of my way!

12:37.132 --> 12:38.759
I'm going to the park
to loiter.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.972
What the hell
is his problem?

12:44.056 --> 12:45.057
I don't know.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.225
He's acting worse
than you did

12:46.308 --> 12:48.435
when you tried to cover
your farts by coughing.

12:48.519 --> 12:50.521
Okay, welcome
to the PTA meeting.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.147
On the subject
of school lunches,

12:52.231 --> 12:53.482
I know there's been some concern
about nutrition...

12:53.565 --> 12:54.858
(coughs, farts)

12:54.942 --> 12:56.360
We've had complaints
about the soda machines...

12:56.443 --> 12:57.611
(farts, coughs)

12:57.694 --> 12:59.571
And I have spoken with
the school board...

12:59.655 --> 13:01.073
(loud cough, farting)

13:01.156 --> 13:03.116
Is there something you'd like
to say, Mr. Griffin?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.409
Uh...

13:04.493 --> 13:07.120
(farting):
no...

13:07.829 --> 13:08.997
(quick fart):
No.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.666
No, I'm good.
(coughs, farts)

13:13.001 --> 13:14.127
All right, men.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.838
This obstacle course
represents

13:15.921 --> 13:17.256
the final test
of your training.

13:17.381 --> 13:18.799
Almost all of you
have completed it

13:18.924 --> 13:19.925
in the allotted time.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.094
But as you know,
as a unit,

13:22.177 --> 13:25.097
you either all graduate,
or none of you graduate.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.974
Griffin, it's up to you.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.141
All right, you can
do this, Brian.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.476
Come on, pray with me.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.272
Dear Lord...
just stay out of our way.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.606
Okay, good luck.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.358
And... go!

13:36.441 --> 13:39.403
(military band music plays)

13:55.961 --> 13:57.254
There's Waldo.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.050
Fresh pepper?
Yes, thank you.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.553
Oh, that's plenty,
thanks.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.096
None for me, thanks.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.140
My boyfriend
just dumped me.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.474
There's a lot of
fish in the sea.

14:09.558 --> 14:10.893
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.394
If it's not meant to be,
it's not meant to be.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.478
(cheerful):
Thanks!

14:15.397 --> 14:16.940
You did it, Brian!
You did it!

14:17.024 --> 14:19.234
Oh, I say, this is an even
bigger accomplishment

14:19.318 --> 14:22.154
than getting Minnie Driver's
head to fit onscreen.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.530
DIRECTOR:
Okay, back up.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.073
Further.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.158
Move back some more.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.118
CAMERA MAN:What?!
Back up some more.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.120
I'm as far away
as I can get.

14:30.204 --> 14:31.496
Okay, have her enter.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.165
Action!

14:33.248 --> 14:34.499
Damn it. Cut!

14:37.211 --> 14:38.962
Congratulations, men.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.839
You've all passed
basic training.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.758
I'm proud to call you soldiers.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.010
I'm sure you'll do your country
proud tomorrow morning,

14:45.093 --> 14:47.387
when you're all shipped off
to Iraq.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.889
What?
Oh, don't worry.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.557
I'm sure he means
Fraggle Iraq.

14:57.689 --> 14:58.732
Well, this isn't so bad.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.025
Yes, the people
are friendly.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.652
I say, the media
has totally

15:01.735 --> 15:03.529
blown this whole thing
out of proportion.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.156
Okay, I go in store,
I throw backpack.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.241
Big boom.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.909
No, no, no, you
are big boom.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.035
Big hero.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.119
Okay, right,

15:11.203 --> 15:12.788
so I throw backpack,
come back

15:12.871 --> 15:14.915
and have big hero party
with many virgins.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.292
No, no, no, no,
no. You: boom.

15:17.376 --> 15:20.170
Oh, okay, okay.
I put on backpack, boom.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.714
Then I come back,
big hero, virgins.

15:22.881 --> 15:23.882
Okay, yeah.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.467
See you in a few
minutes, big hero.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.594
(over walkie-talkie): Unit 17,
this is base. Please report.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.513
Ten-four, everything's
Charlie 40-60.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.181
What does that mean?
I don't know.

15:31.265 --> 15:32.933
I just thought you're supposed
to say names and numbers.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.017
Nobody's corrected
me so far.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.143
(explosion)
Aah!

15:35.227 --> 15:36.854
What the hell was that?!

15:37.813 --> 15:39.314
Uh, help! Help!

15:39.398 --> 15:42.025
Uh, uh, I mean, ah, ah,
Charlie, Tango, Cash, uh,

15:42.109 --> 15:44.653
47, Victor, Charlie,
Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman!

15:44.736 --> 15:46.613
Roger that.
We're moving to your position.

15:46.697 --> 15:47.739
(screams)

15:49.658 --> 15:52.244
Chris, your father and I
are very upset

15:52.327 --> 15:53.620
by this new attitude
of yours.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.998
I don't care
what you think of me!

15:56.081 --> 15:57.207
Oh, God, I envy that.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.500
I am so self-conscious

15:58.584 --> 15:59.960
about what people
think of me.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.545
I am out of here!

16:01.628 --> 16:03.213
You know, I think
I may have an idea

16:03.297 --> 16:05.340
what's causing
this behavior, Peter.

16:05.424 --> 16:07.176
Look at all this stuff.

16:08.177 --> 16:09.845
Listen to these lyrics.

16:09.928 --> 16:13.599
"I rip it hardcore
like porno-flick bitches,

16:13.682 --> 16:17.019
I roll with groups of ghetto
bastards with biscuits."

16:17.102 --> 16:19.188
Oh, look, they've got a
translation for white people:

16:19.271 --> 16:22.900
"I give 110 percent when it
comes to helping my community

16:22.983 --> 16:25.194
"even though I
occasionally associate

16:25.277 --> 16:27.279
with some less than
reputable characters."

16:27.362 --> 16:29.531
Peter, these lyrics
are filthy.

16:29.615 --> 16:32.910
All this violent music
is what's screwing Chris up.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.036
What the hell?

16:34.119 --> 16:36.038
Marilyn Manson!

16:36.121 --> 16:37.956
Is that who's causing all this?

16:38.040 --> 16:40.000
Yeah, it's all him
or her's fault.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.002
Who does he or she
think he or she is?

16:42.085 --> 16:44.046
Look, you can totally
see his or her nipples.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.464
That's obscene, maybe.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.257
There's only one thing to do.

16:47.341 --> 16:49.927
You're right, we got to
find this Marilyn Manson

16:50.010 --> 16:51.803
and I got to give
that bastard or bitch

16:51.887 --> 16:53.555
a piece of my
mind or penis.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.184
All right, it
shouldn't be too hard

16:57.267 --> 16:58.769
-to get ourselves kicked out.
-Right.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.271
-We're just got to convince them we're
-not army material.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.814
-Ready? All right,
-let's do it.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.984
Wow, look at
how gay we are.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.570
I am so gay,
with my gayness.

17:08.654 --> 17:11.406
Me, too.
I'm... I'm a homo.

17:11.490 --> 17:12.991
Any room
for one more?

17:13.075 --> 17:14.618
Hell yeah!

17:16.495 --> 17:17.913
All right, last resort.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.957
We get injured and go home
with purple hearts.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.166
Shoot me in the foot.
What?

17:21.250 --> 17:22.251
Shoot yourself
in the foot.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.044
No, no, no, they can
tell by the angle.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.337
Here, you shoot me
and I'll shoot you.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.547
I don't think
this is gonna work.

17:26.630 --> 17:27.631
Of course it'll work.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.217
Ready?
One, two, three...

17:30.300 --> 17:31.635
Aah! Damn it!

17:31.802 --> 17:33.136
Oh, my God! That hurts!

17:33.220 --> 17:34.513
I think you missed me.

17:34.596 --> 17:35.597
All right,
I'll try again.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.140
Uh, no, no,
no, hang, hang on.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.142
-That looks like it's painful.
-Of course it's painful!

17:39.226 --> 17:41.103
There's a bullet in my foot!
Now get over here!

17:41.186 --> 17:42.521
No, no, no, no, no!
I changed my mind!

17:42.604 --> 17:44.273
I don't want to do it!
Come on, we had a deal!

17:44.356 --> 17:45.649
No, no, no, no,
don't point that at me!

17:45.816 --> 17:47.109
No, no, no, oh, come on,

17:47.192 --> 17:48.777
this is flat out
just not safe!

17:48.861 --> 17:50.904
Ooh. Ow. Ow.
Oh, you got me.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.197
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Let me see.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.907
No, no, it's gross.
Let me see it.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.200
No, no, I don't want
to gross you out.

17:55.284 --> 17:57.870
Oh, ow, oh, we are in
so much pain right now,

17:57.953 --> 17:59.413
the two of us.
Oh, ow...

17:59.496 --> 18:01.123
(screams):
Okay, that was real!

18:02.165 --> 18:03.625
Hey, hi, um,

18:03.709 --> 18:06.044
I'm Private Stewie,
and this is Private Brian.

18:06.128 --> 18:09.256
Uh, we both got shot in
the foot, so, uh, we figured

18:09.339 --> 18:11.633
an honorable discharge
would be in order and, uh,

18:11.717 --> 18:13.302
you could just send us
back to the States.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.470
Getting shot doesn't get you
out of here anymore.

18:15.596 --> 18:18.015
-What? Yeah, we take
-whatever we can get.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.185
I mean, we got two dead guys
guarding the ammunition.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.436
Sorry, guys,

18:22.519 --> 18:24.146
you are here until
the job is done.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.606
Great news, everybody.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.691
Democracy just kicked in!

18:42.247 --> 18:45.375
(squealing laughter)

18:48.587 --> 18:49.713
So... so it's over?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.006
That seems unlikely.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.132
Amazing.

18:52.216 --> 18:53.800
There was only one man
in the world

18:53.884 --> 18:56.053
with the vision to predict
something like this.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.681
Damn.

19:01.350 --> 19:02.976
Laura! Laura!

19:03.060 --> 19:04.228
Laura!

19:09.566 --> 19:12.694
And the Grammy for Biggest Posse
goes to...

19:12.778 --> 19:13.987
Ja Rule.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.072
What?!

19:15.155 --> 19:16.156
No, Madonna.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.991
"Posse." "Posse."

19:18.075 --> 19:19.076
Oh.

19:22.371 --> 19:24.581
All right, Marilyn Manson
has to be here somewhere.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.792
Good thing we distracted
the guard with that riddle.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.753
What gets wetter as it dries...?

19:29.837 --> 19:31.129
A towel.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.464
Hey, I've been had!

19:33.549 --> 19:35.300
Hey, look,
right over there.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.469
Hey, Manson!

19:37.553 --> 19:38.679
What in the world
was that for?

19:38.887 --> 19:40.055
Oh, it's a guy.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.723
That's for
ruining our son.

19:41.849 --> 19:44.726
He used to be a sweet boy
until he heard your music.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.520
(chuckles)
This old story.

19:46.645 --> 19:47.980
If I had a nickel...

19:48.063 --> 19:49.439
All right,
where's your son?

19:49.565 --> 19:52.150
I'm hiding underneath my seats
for fear

19:52.234 --> 19:53.902
He'll point
and show his tail

19:53.986 --> 19:56.446
Chris? We brought someone
you might like to meet.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.950
(gasps):
Oh, my God, Marilyn Manson!

20:00.033 --> 20:01.076
Hey there, Chris.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.703
You working hard
or hardly working?

20:02.786 --> 20:04.621
(laughing heartily)

20:04.705 --> 20:06.039
So I see you're
in a band.

20:06.123 --> 20:07.833
-Yep. Listen, your
-parents tell me

20:07.916 --> 20:09.293
you've been acting out
a little bit.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.961
And I just wanted
to tell you,

20:11.044 --> 20:12.713
rock n' roll music
is cool,

20:12.796 --> 20:14.173
but respect
for your elders

20:14.256 --> 20:15.966
is a tune we can
all dance to.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.968
Really?
Sure.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.761
And the best way to start
a fun-filled day

20:19.845 --> 20:22.306
of being a good citizen
is with a healthy breakfast

20:22.389 --> 20:23.891
rich in breads and grains.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.642
And fruits are important, too.

20:25.726 --> 20:28.729
You mean like apples,
oranges and bananas?

20:28.812 --> 20:30.814
Any of 'em, Chris.
You can't miss.

20:30.898 --> 20:33.358
And now, I think your parents
have something to say.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.027
Chris, you don't
really believe

20:35.110 --> 20:36.987
all the things in those
song lyrics, do you?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.155
No.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.324
Then why you been acting
like such a punk?

20:40.407 --> 20:42.242
I guess I don't
really know.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.869
I think I have
an idea.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.162
Peter, when was the last time

20:45.245 --> 20:47.206
you and Chris here
did something together?

20:47.331 --> 20:48.999
Boy, I guess
it's been a while.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.459
Here's something
you might not know--

20:50.542 --> 20:52.544
children crave structure.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.005
They enjoy the fun
of planned activities

20:55.088 --> 20:56.757
in which they and
their parent or guardian

20:56.840 --> 20:58.383
can share a common goal.

20:58.467 --> 20:59.927
Maybe you could
take Chris fishing.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.094
What do you say, Chris?

21:01.178 --> 21:03.096
You want to go fishing
with your old man?

21:03.180 --> 21:04.681
Do I?

21:04.765 --> 21:06.058
Can't go without these.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.894
(laughing)
