00:04.671 --> 00:06.605
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.607 --> 00:11.043
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:11.045 --> 00:12.678
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:15.280
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.282 --> 00:17.716
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.718 --> 00:20.119
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:21.587
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:23.022
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.024 --> 00:24.757
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.759 --> 00:26.592
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.761
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:28.763 --> 00:31.296
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.298 --> 00:33.465
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.467 --> 00:35.801
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.803 --> 00:38.504
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:40.472
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:43.776
(siren wailing)

00:48.581 --> 00:52.718
In the past 24 hours,
you have broken over two dozen

00:52.720 --> 00:54.253
State and federal laws.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.587
You've dealt homeland security

00:55.589 --> 00:57.656
A public relations nightmare.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.558
And you destroyed
over $100 million

00:59.560 --> 01:01.827
Worth of private property!

01:01.829 --> 01:03.162
Which is why you

01:03.164 --> 01:04.830
Ironically named geniuses...

01:04.832 --> 01:06.432
The wrong use of "ironic."

01:07.734 --> 01:10.803
...Are hereby ordered for
psychological evaluation.

01:10.805 --> 01:13.372
That evaluation
decides your future.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.640
From what I see,

01:14.642 --> 01:17.109
You're too mentally unstable
to handle this job.

01:19.679 --> 01:21.547
Anything else

01:21.549 --> 01:22.714
Smart you want to say?

01:22.716 --> 01:23.849
No.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.562
So much for your
little experiment.

01:36.564 --> 01:40.466
Woman:
And as the psychologist
assigned to this case,

01:40.468 --> 01:43.669
I will interview each member
of your team individually.

01:43.671 --> 01:47.439
You will take me through the
events of the past 24 hours

01:47.441 --> 01:49.675
And explain your decisions.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.677
Happy to help however I can.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.545
Lying is one hallmark

01:53.547 --> 01:56.281
Of antisocial
personality disorder.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.150
So, first off,

01:58.152 --> 01:59.685
I suggest you be honest.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.287
Honestly?

02:02.289 --> 02:03.489
I'm looking at your diploma,

02:03.491 --> 02:05.290
Thinking I could have got
into your alma mater

02:05.292 --> 02:06.492
When I was seven.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.827
Let's start

02:08.829 --> 02:10.829
At the beginning.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.899
Okay, but first
I-I should mention

02:13.901 --> 02:16.902
That I also have a phd
in clinical psychology.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.471
Perhaps our time would be
better spent talking about you.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.473
I don't think so.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.743
Say more about that.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.378
Ask me anything.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.514
I'm an open book.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.516
Sylvester:
<i>It all started yesterday.</i>

02:30.518 --> 02:32.751
One sec.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.753
Oh, my god.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.255
Okay.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.158
All right.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.292
From the beginning.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.261
Well, it all began
with costumes.

02:45.198 --> 02:48.700
Hmm, do you have the summary
document on our last job?

02:48.702 --> 02:50.736
Good morning
to you, too, walter.

02:50.738 --> 02:51.937
How are you today?

02:51.939 --> 02:54.439
Oh, you prefer
a different greeting.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.208
Okay. Good morning.
How are you?

02:56.210 --> 02:57.843
Do you have the summary document
on our last job?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.478
I'll send it to you.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.712
And thank you for asking.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.714
I've been preparing for ralph's

03:02.716 --> 03:05.184
School Halloween party tomorrow,
but he doesn't want

03:05.186 --> 03:06.485
To go 'cause he has
no one to go with.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.886
Mm-hmm.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.588
Come on, it's Halloween.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.722
Exactly.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.424
What does that mean?
It's a holiday

03:12.426 --> 03:14.893
Based on 16th century traditions
of warding off evil spirits.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.828
It's not exactly progress.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.230
To say nothing
of contributions

03:18.232 --> 03:19.264
To tooth decay,

03:19.266 --> 03:20.632
Juvenile diabetes, early death.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.668
You asked.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.803
(door opens)

03:24.805 --> 03:26.638
Good news.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.607
Your friend the governor has
recommended you for a new gig.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.876
And unlike the last few,
this one's cushy.

03:30.878 --> 03:35.647
Is having a new exhibit of
a masterpiece by franz biermann.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.715
I love his work.
Never heard of him.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.350
The verstand
museum in germany

03:38.352 --> 03:39.451
Owns the painting,

03:39.453 --> 03:40.819
But while it's
within our borders

03:40.821 --> 03:42.521
It falls under the
purview of homeland.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.856
We picked up some chatter
on some dark-net sites.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.925
It's a highly coveted
target for art thieves.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.761
We need you to upgrade the
security systems at the museum.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.330
I'll fill you in on the
details on the way.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.664
And merrick granted
your request.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.901
What request?

03:57.670 --> 03:59.938
Walter:
<i>This is great.</i>

03:59.940 --> 04:02.274
Traveling together will
increase efficiency.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.543
This is on trial loan
from the department,

04:04.545 --> 04:06.011
So go easy on it.

04:06.013 --> 04:09.281
Isn't security work a little
below our pay grade?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.649
The painting's worth
a hundred million bucks.

04:10.651 --> 04:14.519
How is $32 of paint and canvas
worth a hundred million?

04:14.521 --> 04:16.788
It's one of humanity's
great achievements.
It's paint and canvas.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.457
Sylvester: Art critic
leslie reinman calls it

04:18.459 --> 04:21.927
"an exquisite rendering
of late 19th century

04:21.929 --> 04:23.929
"small-town tranquility

04:23.931 --> 04:26.565
"whose rhapsodic gestures
connote optimism

04:26.567 --> 04:27.566
"and...

04:27.568 --> 04:29.568
Possibility."

04:31.437 --> 04:33.005
Um...

04:33.007 --> 04:37.309
My hypersensitivity and
overactive emotional quotient

04:37.311 --> 04:40.345
Are at times triggered
by works of art.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.748
Don't tell me you
have a problem

04:42.750 --> 04:43.949
With Halloween
<i>and</i> art.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.684
They're both make-believe.
All ascribed value.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.319
Paige: I took a
night school class

04:47.321 --> 04:49.988
Ever seen his
paintings of tahiti?

04:49.990 --> 04:52.391
They're mind-blowing.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.826
Walter:
Well, in the time period
of the biermann painting,

04:54.828 --> 04:56.428
There were grain shortages
and starvation.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.297
That old woman looks
like she has gout.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.499
That ten-year-old girl--
middle-aged.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.001
Hmm.
You can't openly
mock things

05:03.003 --> 05:04.303
99% of the world enjoys.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.504
If you want to grow
this business,

05:05.506 --> 05:07.339
Take on private clients,

05:07.341 --> 05:08.840
Even be a functioning
member of society,

05:08.842 --> 05:10.776
You have to learn how
normal people work.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.878
Yes, but to what end?

05:12.880 --> 05:15.781
You being more human could
help us get more jobs

05:15.783 --> 05:17.316
And improve relationships
with superiors,

05:17.318 --> 05:18.984
Make <i>my</i> life more sane.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.053
Think of it as
an experiment.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.656
I'll give it a try.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.892
Paige:
<i>Geniuses have</i>

05:26.894 --> 05:29.027
Low eq, or emotional quotient,

05:29.029 --> 05:31.330
Hence their difficulty
relating to us.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.865
Sure, they have their issues,
but they're also

05:33.867 --> 05:36.668
Brilliant
and-and brave and special.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.503
You're protecting
your job.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.372
If I thought they were unstable,

05:40.374 --> 05:42.107
Would I allow my son
around them?

05:43.643 --> 05:46.712
Your son... <i>Is</i> them.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.981
Thank you.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.751
I think he's special, too.

05:53.986 --> 05:57.556
Take me through
walter's behavior at the museum.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.793
Um...
Man: <i>This is</i>
<i>an exceedingly rare work</i>

06:01.795 --> 06:04.363
By an artist whose
other paintings have
all been destroyed

06:04.365 --> 06:06.064
During world war ii,
so as curator,

06:06.066 --> 06:07.966
Its security is

06:07.968 --> 06:09.067
My responsibility,

06:09.069 --> 06:10.869
And forgive me
for saying so, but...

06:10.871 --> 06:13.939
They don't seem like
typical law enforcement.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.613
Cabe:
We're <i>not</i> typical

06:21.615 --> 06:23.148
Law enforcement,
dr. Paulson.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.383
We're better.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.386
Very excited
to protect

06:27.388 --> 06:29.121
Your beautiful
and important art.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.124
Right.

06:33.993 --> 06:35.093
Was that supposed to be normal?

06:35.095 --> 06:37.396
Experiment's begun--
not bad, huh?

06:38.164 --> 06:39.631
Terrifying.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.434
Good luck with this.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.080
Take a look at this.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.826
He's getting
<i>awfully</i> close to it.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.094
Maybe he's enjoying it.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.930
Walter may have some eq.

07:14.000 --> 07:14.933
(ripping)

07:14.935 --> 07:16.067
(alarm blaring)
no!

07:19.205 --> 07:21.540
(gasping)

07:22.675 --> 07:23.742
Paige:
And...

07:23.744 --> 07:26.545
I stand corrected.

07:35.855 --> 07:37.456
I was doing my job.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.759
Slashing a canvas
is your job?

07:40.761 --> 07:44.863
Or evidence of your lack
of emotional maturity?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.498
Both. I don't
have emotions.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.033
I read that
in your file.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.734
But how can you
protect something

07:49.736 --> 07:51.470
If you don't
care about it?

07:51.472 --> 07:57.042
I can't really tell
if you're purposely
being contemptuous,

07:57.044 --> 07:59.478
Of maybe you are unstable.
Well, if you dismissed

07:59.480 --> 08:01.213
Every government worker
who was unstable,

08:01.215 --> 08:02.981
Washington would cease to exist.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.983
Giving these responses,

08:04.985 --> 08:07.185
How do you expect me
to approve you?

08:07.187 --> 08:08.653
I don't.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.822
But to fail us would be
to disregard the fact

08:10.824 --> 08:12.824
That no matter
how many people got upset,

08:12.826 --> 08:13.992
My actions had a purpose.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.061
I cut the painting
to thoroughly examine

08:16.063 --> 08:18.063
Both sides of the canvas--
it was efficient.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.998
Efficient?
Are you out
of your mind?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.133
Do you have any idea
how much this painting is worth?

08:22.135 --> 08:24.069
Yes-- as I
said, nothing.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.971
It's a fake.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.572
And there are several
reasons why

08:27.574 --> 08:28.773
We knew this,
starting with paige.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.141
She loves this artist.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.643
Seeing the painting
should have made her happy.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.144
Toby: But when she
looked at the painting,

08:33.146 --> 08:34.679
She displayed
the same repulsion markers

08:34.681 --> 08:36.014
Our sense of smell gives us

08:36.016 --> 08:38.016
To rotting meat
when it exudes an odor.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.885
Her subconscious
instinctively knew

08:39.887 --> 08:42.854
Something was off, but she
didn't know what it was.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.589
Then I did a quick count
of the brushstrokes.

08:44.591 --> 08:45.690
There's one thousand,
three hundred

08:45.692 --> 08:46.525
And eighty-seven,

08:46.527 --> 08:47.225
Which is

08:47.227 --> 08:48.693
48 less than the original.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.961
Happy:
And...

08:49.963 --> 08:51.229
The type of nails
in the frame

08:51.231 --> 08:52.998
Weren't even manufactured
until four years

08:53.000 --> 08:55.100
After this painting
was supposedly made.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.035
Rotting meat...

08:57.037 --> 08:59.037
Brushstrokes...

08:59.039 --> 09:00.972
And nails?

09:02.141 --> 09:03.842
That's all you had to go on

09:03.844 --> 09:05.110
Before you destroyed
a masterpiece?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.244
A fake masterpiece.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.779
Woman:
He's right.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.881
Special agent carey,
fbi art crimes.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.116
We just analyzed
the paint

09:11.118 --> 09:12.651
And carbon-dated
the frame.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.052
The painting
is a forgery.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.220
Walter: Thank you
for repeating

09:15.222 --> 09:18.223
Exactly what I said
63 minutes ago.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.127
(paulson scoffs)

09:22.129 --> 09:24.262
That is a lovely windbreaker.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.698
We may be able to I.D.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.667
The forger by fingerprints
left in the paint.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.902
Well, you won't find
any fingerprints
in the paint,

09:30.904 --> 09:32.637
Because this painting
wasn't made by hand,

09:32.639 --> 09:33.972
It was made by machine.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.308
A forgery of this quality
made by a machine?

09:36.310 --> 09:38.343
Not possible.
You're right.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.978
It's not possible, it's certain.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.279
Since there's no longer
a painting to protect,

09:41.281 --> 09:44.215
I'm gonna ask you... To leave.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.153
We very much thank you
for the opportunity to...

09:48.155 --> 09:49.154
Go.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.725
How else was I supposed
to tell him it was a fake?

09:53.727 --> 09:57.362
Perhaps by saying,
"it's a fake."

09:57.364 --> 10:01.733
When delivering bad news, most
people try and do so gently.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.667
Waste of time.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.003
How'd the knife work for you?

10:05.005 --> 10:06.104
(door opens)

10:06.106 --> 10:08.640
Miraculously,
special agent carey

10:08.642 --> 10:10.675
Wants you to stay
on the case.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.278
So she appreciated
my efforts.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.680
Cabe:
She found you smug, arrogant

10:15.682 --> 10:17.682
And several other
choice adjectives.

10:17.684 --> 10:21.219
But the fbi is lacking
expertise on this technology.

10:21.221 --> 10:25.857
Thrilled to help anyone who
thinks we're smug and arrogant.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.792
The force of a human hand
applying brushstrokes

10:27.794 --> 10:30.228
Would result in tiny
broken canvas fibers.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.330
But that canvas was
perfectly intact.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.033
Only a machine arm could
paint so delicately.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.335
Plus, the mathematical patterns
in the paint were so precise

10:37.337 --> 10:38.770
That they couldn't
have been executed

10:38.772 --> 10:43.074
So, we follow the technology
to track down the forger.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.376
And I'll have
art crimes investigate

10:44.378 --> 10:46.344
Who swapped the original
for the fake, and when.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.113
We know the original
was authenticated

10:48.115 --> 10:51.182
By customs at lax
at 6:42 this morning,

10:51.184 --> 10:53.184
So we know the swap occurred
sometime after that.

10:53.186 --> 10:56.988
But they'd have to canvass
airport staff, art handlers,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.923
Transport personnel--
th-that could take days.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.125
Well, the problem is,

11:00.127 --> 11:01.326
Most stolen art
leaves the country

11:01.328 --> 11:02.794
Within 24 hours,
never to be seen again.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.831
I know someone who can help us
track it down,

11:06.833 --> 11:08.667
But I want you all
on primo behavior.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.337
A fake biermann?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.272
Does no one have any respect?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.741
If the people looking
at it can't tell,

11:16.743 --> 11:17.809
What's the difference?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.378
Believe me, I know.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.249
Tell me about your
machine theory.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.950
In order to create a
high-quality forgery

11:25.952 --> 11:28.787
You'd first need
a three-dimensional scan

11:28.789 --> 11:29.788
Of the painting,

11:29.790 --> 11:31.456
Capturing every detail

11:31.458 --> 11:33.324
From the brushstroke direction
to the thickness and volume

11:33.326 --> 11:34.759
Of the paint.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.194
Happy: Then a spectral camera
would create

11:36.196 --> 11:38.229
An algorithmic breakdown
of the colors,

11:38.231 --> 11:41.232
To be mixed by the 3-d printer
and applied by machine arm.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.001
Walter:
But first the forger would need

11:43.003 --> 11:45.336
An extremely high-res image
of the original.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.005
Do you know how we can get
our hands on one?

11:47.007 --> 11:48.973
When I was a costumer in london,

11:48.975 --> 11:51.176
I used to visit
the royal stuart museum.

11:51.178 --> 11:55.346
They keep digital images
of major artworks.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.448
Those images have
high enough resolution

11:56.450 --> 11:58.216
To be used
by the forgers.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.784
I'll just hack in.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.453
Or... You could use
my account number.

12:03.989 --> 12:06.157
Thank you.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.828
Unfortunately, the
biermann's been stolen before.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.834
This is the actual
provenance of the painting.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.002
"1936, eckhart mueller,
a jewish shoemaker

12:18.004 --> 12:21.372
"from warsaw, buys
the painting directly from

12:21.374 --> 12:22.907
"the artist franz biermann.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.244
"1942, the nazis seize
the painting from mueller

12:26.246 --> 12:29.447
And send him to auschwitz,
where he's murdered by the ss."

12:29.449 --> 12:30.782
Paige:
"1946,

12:30.784 --> 12:32.016
"the verstand museum
takes possession

12:32.018 --> 12:33.017
"of the painting.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.385
"since then
three generations

12:34.387 --> 12:35.386
"of the muellers
have tried

12:35.388 --> 12:36.821
Unsuccessfully to get it back."

12:36.823 --> 12:39.157
Hetty:
This family has spent a lifetime

12:39.159 --> 12:40.492
Trying to get
this painting back.

12:40.494 --> 12:43.228
Art has meaning.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.364
Sylvester:
Found the image.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.899
4k resolution.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.334
More than enough
to create the forgery.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.770
According
to the manifest,

12:51.772 --> 12:52.871
This file's
been downloaded by

12:52.873 --> 12:54.339
Ecole des beaux-arts students,

12:54.341 --> 12:56.374
Art book publishers
and once by

12:56.376 --> 12:59.911
Somebody from... Galactic toys.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.446
Oh, here we go.
Okay,

13:01.448 --> 13:05.049
Galactic has the greatest
superhero pantheon in this

13:05.051 --> 13:06.451
Or any
other universe,

13:06.453 --> 13:09.320
Including my personal favorite,
super fun guy.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.989
(grumbling)
I'm getting to it.
Walter,

13:10.991 --> 13:12.290
I'm getting
to it, okay?

13:12.292 --> 13:15.326
They manufacture
these little masterpieces

13:15.328 --> 13:17.796
Using state-of-the-art,
cutting-edge

13:17.798 --> 13:20.064
3-d printers and scanners.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.399
They have everything
one would need

13:21.401 --> 13:22.534
To create the perfect forgery.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.402
The forger must work there!

13:24.404 --> 13:27.338
And he is so... Lucky.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.307
Cabe:
We'll scan
their network

13:29.309 --> 13:31.910
And I.D. The employee
on the way.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.311
Thank you, hetty.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.981
Thank you.
It, uh, was an experience.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.517
Okay, guys, come on! Let's go!

13:41.954 --> 13:44.122
I've never seen
him move so fast.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.357
Sylvester:
<i>Okay, galactic toys.</i>

13:46.359 --> 13:49.427
The I.P. Address and lan subnets
have narrowed it down to...

13:49.429 --> 13:51.563
Ten employees,
four of which work

13:51.565 --> 13:54.265
In administration, which means
they lack the skill set

13:54.267 --> 13:57.902
Well, eliminate anyone
with a title of vp or above.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.037
They wouldn't risk their pension

13:59.039 --> 14:00.305
On criminal activity.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.539
Sylvester:
Well, that leaves five.
Only three

14:01.541 --> 14:03.408
Have art backgrounds.
That one!

14:03.410 --> 14:05.310
Look at that knockoff
designer sweater.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.046
He doesn't care
about the difference
between real and fake.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.215
A man after my own heart.
Phil daniels.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.449
Married, three kids.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.218
Needs money, has
ability and motive.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.190
Hey, cabe,
I'm gonna go with you.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.326
You're all staying here,
and that's an order.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.261
I'll be back
in ten minutes.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.296
He's been waiting for
this his whole life.
Well, then he should

14:25.298 --> 14:27.498
Be used to it. I don't need
a bunch of geniuses

14:27.500 --> 14:29.033
To help me detain
an unarmed artist.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.101
(sylvester stammering)

14:32.137 --> 14:34.405
Could you at least get me
a super fun guy t-shirt?

14:35.908 --> 14:37.909
He's really...
Cabe, he's really fun!

14:42.348 --> 14:46.351
I am 50 feet from valhalla,
but I might as well be 50 miles.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.887
Paige:
Maybe you should
emulate sylvester.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.623
He might be extreme,
but at least... He emotes.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.992
That is not ideal to me.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.260
Psychologist:
<i>So if walter</i>

14:55.262 --> 14:57.929
Has no emotional
quotient, you have...

14:57.931 --> 14:59.530
Infinitely too much.

15:00.532 --> 15:02.066
What are you looking at?

15:02.068 --> 15:05.169
That bookshelf's not anchored.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.638
If there was an earthquake,
it could fall,

15:06.640 --> 15:09.407
It could crush you, causing
massive trauma, a concussion.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.142
Plus, I wouldn't want to see
any of that blood.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.144
I'm sorry.

15:13.146 --> 15:17.649
Does your anxiety hinder
your ability to do your job?

15:17.651 --> 15:19.050
And if so,

15:19.052 --> 15:20.985
How can you work on this team?

15:20.987 --> 15:22.387
Well, because of walter.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.390
He keeps me out of my head,
keeps me focused on the work.

15:25.392 --> 15:30.428
I'd just move the chair just,
like, a couple inches.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.398
Because the parrot
has a hat on.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.200
Oh, that's funny.
Uh, technically.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.368
It's funny completely.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.972
Bringing a parrot into a bar
makes no sense.

15:42.474 --> 15:44.409
You're disappointed.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.045
Just starting to see the scope
of what needs to be done.

15:50.182 --> 15:51.582
In the meantime,
I can still solve this case.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.684
Cut him off at the corner.

15:52.686 --> 15:53.418
Sylvester:
Okay.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.485
I'll get cabe!

15:54.487 --> 15:56.454
It's faster to call him!
What?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.422
I can't hear you!

15:57.424 --> 15:58.990
Hey! Hey!

16:03.495 --> 16:06.664
Stop! Stop! I'm a federal agent!

16:09.535 --> 16:10.368
Hey!

16:10.370 --> 16:11.636
(tires screeching)

16:18.110 --> 16:19.377
Are you working out
some issues?

16:19.379 --> 16:20.545
Shh!

16:20.547 --> 16:22.180
Ow.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.681
(grunts)

16:29.455 --> 16:31.422
(tires screeching)

16:35.494 --> 16:37.095
Hey! Hey!

16:39.064 --> 16:40.565
(grunts)

16:41.333 --> 16:43.401
(groaning)

16:46.005 --> 16:48.072
(panting)

16:49.608 --> 16:51.409
I can't...

16:51.411 --> 16:54.379
(panting)

16:54.381 --> 16:56.114
I looked

16:56.116 --> 16:57.181
Everywhere for you.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.319
(tires screech)

17:10.629 --> 17:11.562
Walter:
Are those chicken feathers?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.097
This is all fixable.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.633
(sighs)

17:23.042 --> 17:27.512
Whether or not I'm stable--
fascinating question.

17:27.514 --> 17:31.315
I've personally treated
many mentally unstable people.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.217
Dated some, too.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.486
You're trying to game me again,
mr. Curtis.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.355
Answer my question.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.257
I'm rock steady.
The only reason

17:39.259 --> 17:40.391
We disregarded cabe's orders

17:40.393 --> 17:42.393
Is because we had
to chase daniels.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.228
He could have led us
to the painting.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.297
Through busy downtown streets.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.834
Government employees are
supposed to protect property,

17:49.836 --> 17:51.669
Not destroy it.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.138
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.239
That's not
a metaphor.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.408
I'm just stating a fact
about breakfast.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.611
You know another sign
of antisocial behavior?

18:00.613 --> 18:01.679
Witty humor?

18:01.681 --> 18:03.247
Addiction issues.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.183
That's my favorite kind.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.286
I'm in good hands
in the employ of walter o'brien,

18:08.288 --> 18:11.355
One of the most intelligent
human beings in the world.

18:12.558 --> 18:16.394
From my file, it seems like
you're in competition with him.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.697
No. He's infinitely smarter
than both of us.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.866
When I met him,
I was gambling

18:21.868 --> 18:25.470
Every night,
in jail pretty often, too.

18:25.472 --> 18:28.473
I'd still be there
if it weren't for walter.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.409
He's pretty exceptional.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.212
Don't tell him I said that.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.880
You spooked him.

18:35.882 --> 18:39.150
He won't talk. The fbi
gave us one hour with him

18:39.152 --> 18:40.351
And we're at zero.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.520
That's what happens
when a guy gets chased

18:42.522 --> 18:45.857
By a bunch of weirdos in a van
covered in chicken feathers.

18:45.859 --> 18:48.126
The fbi searched
his house,

18:48.128 --> 18:50.761
His storage locker, his records,
everything, turned up nothing.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.763
The painting's
worth $100 mil.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.298
If he doesn't
talk fast,

18:54.300 --> 18:55.833
We'll never see it again.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.436
Give me 30 seconds with him.

19:05.844 --> 19:08.713
So, agent gallo in there
thinks you stole the painting.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.248
I know
you didn't do it.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.315
Well, finally,

19:11.317 --> 19:13.317
Someone who believes
I'm innocent.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.418
I didn't say you're innocent.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.155
You graduated calarts
nine years ago,

19:17.157 --> 19:19.524
Dreaming of becoming
the next picasso.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.626
Then you had
a few small shows, but...

19:21.628 --> 19:23.427
The decision makers in suits
didn't get your brilliance.

19:23.429 --> 19:27.465
Then you slipped one past
the goalie with your girlfriend.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.233
Diapers
are not cheap.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.769
So you took a job
with galactic toys.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.305
It's hard to believe you've been
there nearly a decade,

19:34.307 --> 19:37.341
Watching your dreams
slip away. But the calluses

19:37.343 --> 19:39.544
On your right thumb and
middle finger tell me you still

19:39.546 --> 19:41.412
Paint every day.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.247
You're
an artist.

19:43.249 --> 19:46.317
All artists want the same thing:
Recognition.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.452
So when someone offered
to pay you to forge a painting,

19:48.454 --> 19:52.356
Finally, someone recognized
your skill.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.660
In fact, you could have done
that whole thing by hand.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.196
You only supplemented
your skill with a machine

19:58.198 --> 19:59.363
Because they made you.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.731
I want a lawyer.
Sure,

20:00.733 --> 20:02.500
That'll convince people
you're innocent.

20:02.502 --> 20:08.539
Stole the original themselves,
making you an accomplice.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.874
Whoa.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.543
I was hired to make a copy
of a painting,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.412
Which is not illegal.

20:14.414 --> 20:17.415
What the guy did with it
after that is his business.
The irony is

20:17.417 --> 20:20.251
He's not gonna take the fall
for it-- you are.

20:21.420 --> 20:22.753
Just give me his name.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.256
Cabe:
Jacques labeaux.
Real estate tycoon.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.358
Friend of the mayor. He paid
daniels to forge the painting.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.727
Most of labeaux's
online accounts

20:29.729 --> 20:31.529
Were impenetrable,
but we discovered

20:31.531 --> 20:33.264
That he pays
two electric bills,

20:33.266 --> 20:34.532
One for his main house

20:34.534 --> 20:36.767
And one for a separate
climate-controlled room.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.302
It's a wine cellar.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.538
No, that's not a wine cellar.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.574
Look at the electricity usage.
It's a huge room.

20:43.576 --> 20:48.446
Much more suitable for...
Storing art.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.248
Gonna have to trust happy
on this one, toby.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.816
Trust me on
this, walter.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.285
We're talking wine,
one of my specialties.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.586
Doesn't really
matter right now.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.487
All we have
is the word

20:56.489 --> 20:58.589
Of an admitted forger.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.558
We'll never get a search warrant
with that alone.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.293
I'll call in
some favors

21:02.295 --> 21:03.394
And see if I can't get
a wiretap,

21:03.396 --> 21:06.664
You hang tight until you
receive further orders.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.700
I'll update you as soon
as I have something.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.470
So labeaux commissioned
the fake,

21:12.472 --> 21:14.372
So we have to assume
he has a real painting.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.473
Chances are he's
trying to move it.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.674
Any idea on his whereabouts?

21:16.676 --> 21:18.009
Uh...

21:18.011 --> 21:19.477
I'm digging,

21:19.479 --> 21:21.345
I'm digging...
Okay, got some thing.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.614
He's at home, preparing for

21:23.616 --> 21:26.517
A big charity gala tonight.
Guys!

21:26.519 --> 21:27.852
This is happening
right now.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.820
He'll be hosting
hundreds of people,

21:29.822 --> 21:31.989
Three bars, live music...

21:31.991 --> 21:33.057
Walter:
And us.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.628
Walter:
Cabe is gonna cost us
an opportunity.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.896
Happy:
Are we really
going to smuggle

21:38.898 --> 21:40.531
A painting out
during a party?

21:40.533 --> 21:42.466
There will be equipment
coming in and out,

21:42.468 --> 21:43.801
Trucks, commotion...

21:43.803 --> 21:45.469
The whole thing
could be a subterfuge

21:45.471 --> 21:47.738
To try and smuggle that painting
out of the country tonight.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.773
Now, happy,
toby...

21:48.775 --> 21:49.807
You'll slip in,

21:49.809 --> 21:51.075
Try and locate that painting.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.610
If you can't find it, then,

21:52.612 --> 21:55.012
We're gonna need all the details
that we can get

21:55.014 --> 21:56.914
On labeaux
and his business dealings.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.917
Paige, I'm gonna hack us
onto the guest list.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.553
Try and get as close to labeaux
so we can clone his phone.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.755
Sly, you'll qb from the van.

22:06.091 --> 22:08.492
Without cabe,
we won't get the gear we need.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.660
And I have nothing to wear.

22:10.962 --> 22:14.565
I am not being a diva.
I was a broke waitress

22:14.567 --> 22:16.434
Six weeks ago.
I literally have

22:16.436 --> 22:18.436
Nothing to wear
for a fancy party.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.671
I know someone
who can help on both fronts.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.573
You were smart to come back.

22:22.575 --> 22:25.776
This party, I'm sure, will have

22:25.778 --> 22:28.612
A fashion-forward crowd.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.014
And in the wrong clothes,
you'd be

22:30.016 --> 22:31.549
Spotted immediately as fakes.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.783
Happy:
It's Halloween weekend.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.618
Why isn't labeaux
having a costume ball?

22:34.620 --> 22:37.355
Walter:
'cause rich people are smart.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.023
They know
that Halloween is foolish.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.525
Aren't you a ray of sunshine?

22:41.527 --> 22:43.361
And I'm a waiter.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.129
Wow.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.631
Sometimes
I even surprise myself.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.800
Is this okay?

22:52.938 --> 22:54.105
Brava.

22:54.107 --> 22:55.673
Really?

22:55.675 --> 22:57.041
Yes.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.611
You silver-tongued devil, you.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.114
Well, what about...
What about, what about me?

23:03.116 --> 23:05.383
Well, you're
in the van, so

23:05.385 --> 23:07.852
You can wear your stupid shirt.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.019
Yes.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.688
Paige:
Uh, do you have any

23:10.690 --> 23:12.757
Halloween costumes for
a nine-year-old boy?

23:12.759 --> 23:15.626
Like a... Like a
zombie or a ninja or

23:15.628 --> 23:17.862
A pirate?

23:17.864 --> 23:19.897
Um, I'll keep looking.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.599
These comm devices

23:21.601 --> 23:23.701
Are on an encoded
frequency.

23:23.703 --> 23:26.437
There you go.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.571
And there.

23:27.573 --> 23:28.572
Thank you.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.441
Out you go.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.643
Before I start to regret

23:32.645 --> 23:34.779
Loaning you
my things.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.690
I've never been
to a party like this.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.192
(clears throat)

23:48.194 --> 23:49.760
Don't worry.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.929
We'll fit right in.

24:03.508 --> 24:05.075
Thank you.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.710
Of course.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.214
Sorry.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.689
There you go.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.758
What about the guest list?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.159
Oh, I took care of it.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.829
(crowd chatter)

24:24.831 --> 24:26.797
Last name?

24:26.799 --> 24:28.199
Gauguin.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.808
â™ª

24:41.680 --> 24:43.814
Looks just like
my apartment.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.749
Focus.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.685
We may never
recover that painting

24:47.687 --> 24:50.488
Unless we get labeaux's
data, wherever he is.

24:52.123 --> 24:55.826
Man:
Mesdames et messieurs,
bienvenue.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.862
I'm your host
jacques labeaux.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.897
And tonight
we will be raising money

24:59.899 --> 25:02.666
For the
arts are fundamental charity.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.768
I hope you'll all
open your hearts

25:04.770 --> 25:06.570
And your wallets

25:06.572 --> 25:07.838
For this great cause.

25:07.840 --> 25:12.109
Any more noble pursuit
than the arts?

25:12.111 --> 25:13.644
(quietly):
Science, mathematics,

25:13.646 --> 25:15.646
Professional wrestling,
anything besides art.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.615
You're missing the
point about art.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.782
Sylvester:
Happy and toby are in position.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.618
Here, time to go,
time to go.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.219
Labeaux:
...Literature,
writing, music.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.523
Alarm off

25:25.525 --> 25:27.291
In three, two, one.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.692
(beeps)

25:28.694 --> 25:30.160
Paige:
I'm unlocking the door.

25:32.864 --> 25:36.000
Sylvester:
To get to the storage locker,
take the northwest

25:36.002 --> 25:37.768
Stairs to the basement level.

25:40.005 --> 25:42.806
Now, to clone labeaux's
phone, we have to get this

25:42.808 --> 25:44.875
Within five feet of him

25:44.877 --> 25:47.011
For three
uninterrupted minutes.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.013
Easy. We'll just
stand near him.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.681
Where'd he go?

25:50.683 --> 25:52.750
Oh. I don't know.

25:56.688 --> 25:58.856
(big band plays slow song)

25:59.858 --> 26:01.825
Got him.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.661
Oh.
Let's dance
next to him.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.931
Come on. There has to be
a more efficient way.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.767
This is the most
efficient way.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.734
I don't dance.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.803
(sighs)

26:18.677 --> 26:20.711
Here's the storage locker.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.346
It's a 96-bit triple-encrypted

26:22.348 --> 26:23.981
Td9 lock.
Do you know how

26:23.983 --> 26:26.350
Impressed I am when I have
no idea what you're saying?

26:26.352 --> 26:28.886
Remind me to dumb it down
next time.

26:31.723 --> 26:33.691
â™ª

26:33.693 --> 26:35.259
You ready?

26:35.261 --> 26:37.328
No.
Sylvester:
You need to stay within

26:37.330 --> 26:40.864
Five feet of him
for three minutes starting now.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.867
We're a couple, remember?

26:43.869 --> 26:45.736
Do you know where
to put your hands?

26:47.739 --> 26:50.608
(laughing):
You're not pushing
me on a swing.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.009
Lower.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.911
(creaking)

26:54.879 --> 26:56.213
Lower.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.249
Put your hand lower.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.352
Good.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.754
Keep it there
at the small of my back.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.022
(groans)

27:05.024 --> 27:06.957
Oh, it's not bad.

27:06.959 --> 27:07.925
It's easy, right?

27:07.927 --> 27:09.259
Basic mathematics.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.928
Count the beats,
four-four time,

27:10.930 --> 27:12.963
Uh, 76 beats per minute.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.798
That explains it.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.668
(beep, door unlocks)

27:17.670 --> 27:19.903
We're in.

27:30.916 --> 27:35.119
Do you know why
geniuses can't dance?

27:35.121 --> 27:37.388
'cause we have
two left brains.

27:37.390 --> 27:39.390
(laughs)

27:39.392 --> 27:41.992
Walter, did you just
make a joke?

27:41.994 --> 27:44.995
I used wordplay to
manipulate a common phrase.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.797
Well, it's a start.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.733
I think your experiment
is starting to work.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.202
â™ª

27:52.204 --> 27:54.038
Sylvester:
Download

27:54.040 --> 27:55.939
Will complete in 15 seconds.

28:01.079 --> 28:03.781
(computer chirping, beep)
oh, no. Malfunction!

28:03.783 --> 28:05.315
Walter, the cloning device
reset! You have

28:05.317 --> 28:06.917
To start the download
all over again!

28:06.919 --> 28:10.120
We have to
keep dancing.
Okay.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.363
May I cut in?

28:19.365 --> 28:22.166
I can't not dance with the most
beautiful woman at my party.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.300
(laughs)
sylvester:
90 seconds.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.334
Stall, walter.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.436
Oh, well,

28:25.438 --> 28:27.304
If it's all right
with you, honey.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.338
I-I'd be delighted.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.377
I'll-I'll just be
over there, honey.

28:39.417 --> 28:41.318
Okay. How much longer?

28:41.320 --> 28:42.953
80 seconds and counting.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.155
(sighs)

28:45.157 --> 28:47.224
It's a cover.
No one keeps

28:47.226 --> 28:49.059
Such fine vintages this cold.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.195
It's not just
a wine cellar.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.464
There's got to be a door
or cabinet or something.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.869
How much time left?

28:58.871 --> 29:00.871
30 seconds.
Will you stop asking?

29:00.873 --> 29:01.872
That's, like, the fourth time.

29:01.874 --> 29:02.973
What's gotten into you, anyway?

29:07.445 --> 29:09.413
This was recently installed.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.950
It's got to be hiding
a secret door.

29:14.452 --> 29:15.519
(grunting)

29:15.521 --> 29:17.821
No door.
Come on.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.056
Sylvester:
Walter, we got it.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.358
Okay.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.327
Excuse me.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.362
May I?
(clears throat)

29:25.364 --> 29:26.930
(speaking french)

29:26.932 --> 29:28.432
<i>Merci.</i>

29:28.434 --> 29:30.267
(laughs)
okay.

29:31.236 --> 29:32.803
Download complete?

29:32.805 --> 29:34.004
Download complete.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.405
(rattling)

29:35.407 --> 29:37.374
There's nothing
behind there.
No.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.243
No.

29:39.245 --> 29:42.146
(groaning)

29:42.148 --> 29:43.480
Oh.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.417
It's just a wine cellar.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.253
Man:
What was that noise?
Oh, no.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.021
Somebody go
check that out.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.456
Someone's coming.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.390
That's the only exit.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.424
What's going on?

29:54.426 --> 29:57.094
Time to go.

29:57.096 --> 29:58.495
Sylvester, we're about
to get made. Do something!

29:58.497 --> 29:59.530
I'm on it.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.534
(clack, electrical buzz,
crowd chatter)

30:03.536 --> 30:04.501
Go, go, go, go!

30:04.503 --> 30:07.571
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

30:07.573 --> 30:09.840
What happened to you guys?

30:09.842 --> 30:11.341
Happy:
We got out through the kitchen,
I ran into

30:11.343 --> 30:12.543
A giant cake.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.478
I don't want
to talk about it.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.513
Toby:
We didn't find the art,
but we cloned the phone.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.582
Walter:
Step on it!

30:23.155 --> 30:26.890
How could I have possibly
known that was a wine cellar?

30:26.892 --> 30:28.992
The painting could be
somewhere else in the house.

30:28.994 --> 30:32.996
By now, labeaux's found
the broken wine bottles,

30:32.998 --> 30:34.932
He knows someone's hacked
into the power.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.200
He knows we're onto him.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.434
He's gonna try
and move that painting fast.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.403
Sylvester?

30:39.405 --> 30:41.271
You search his
call history?

30:41.273 --> 30:43.407
Art world's supposed
to be rarified air,

30:43.409 --> 30:44.942
But instead
it's full of thieves.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.210
This guy stole it
from the museum,

30:46.212 --> 30:47.945
Who stole it
from the mueller family.

30:47.947 --> 30:48.979
This is supposed
to be the intellectual elite?

30:48.981 --> 30:50.881
I thought you didn't
care about art.

30:50.883 --> 30:52.115
I'm faking. Remember?

30:52.117 --> 30:53.283
Sounds awfully real.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.885
Somewhere along the line,

30:54.887 --> 30:56.320
You had a breakthrough.
You're improving.

30:56.322 --> 31:00.157
Half a dozen calls
to one number in the 48 hours

31:00.159 --> 31:01.859
Before the original painting
disappeared.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.961
The name is encrypted,
but I think I can break it.

31:03.963 --> 31:04.862
In how long?

31:04.864 --> 31:07.464
That long.

31:07.466 --> 31:08.632
And I thought I didn't like him

31:08.634 --> 31:10.033
'cause he was a know-it-all
art jerk.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.902
Here's an e-mail
from labeaux to paulson with

31:11.904 --> 31:15.005
His bank's routing
and account numbers.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.574
Labeaux provides access
to the fake,

31:17.576 --> 31:20.043
Paulson provides access
to the original.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.879
We didn't find the painting
at labeaux's because he never

31:21.881 --> 31:24.214
Had it. Paulson does.
As curator,
he could

31:24.216 --> 31:27.050
Easily pull this off. He plans
all the museum's exhibits.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.086
The biermann's worth nine
figures. He wouldn't

31:29.088 --> 31:32.155
Move it by air. There are more
security gaps at the docks.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.191
We'll call cabe from the van.

31:37.262 --> 31:38.528
Paige.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.330
Take this to hetty.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.432
It can't be discussed over
the phone. She'll understand.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.434
What's this about?
Read it, you'll see.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.271
Oh, I'm gonna need to take your
car as well for the wi-fi.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.640
You take the van.
And hurry.

31:49.642 --> 31:52.142
I appreciate it.

31:52.144 --> 31:55.112
I never thought
I'd hear him say that.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.281
Safe to say this is when
the mission went

31:57.283 --> 31:59.082
From the frying pan
into the fire.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.350
Safe to say anything

32:00.352 --> 32:02.619
You want,
unless it pisses me off.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.022
You're guilty
of breaking and entering,

32:05.024 --> 32:06.623
Trespassing,
larceny.

32:06.625 --> 32:10.594
Do you even think how walter
puts all your lives at risk?

32:10.596 --> 32:14.064
We're geniuses.
All we do is think.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.066
Ever think about how none of you

32:16.068 --> 32:18.068
Have anywhere else to go?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.336
Especially you.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.039
Since, from what I can tell,

32:22.041 --> 32:24.041
You have no family to speak of?

32:24.043 --> 32:27.344
There's always a plan,

32:27.346 --> 32:30.480
And we follow it because
we believe in walter.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.182
And besides,

32:32.184 --> 32:34.251
As soon as we knew the
play with the curator,

32:34.253 --> 32:36.086
We called our superior.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.955
Paulson? The curator?
Walter: We've got him, yeah,

32:37.957 --> 32:40.090
We're on his tail right now.
We surveilled him, followed him

32:40.092 --> 32:41.959
To his house, where he put
the painting in his car.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.060
Cabe:
You went through
private property

32:43.062 --> 32:44.261
Without a search warrant.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.229
Anything you saw
is inadmissible in court.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.431
Actually, it is admissible,

32:47.433 --> 32:48.699
Because we're not
working at your behest.

32:48.701 --> 32:51.134
We're operating
as private citizens, so the more

32:51.136 --> 32:53.537
We defy you,
the more legal it is.

32:53.539 --> 32:54.972
That's good to know.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.273
We got to remember that
for next time.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.607
All right,
I scanned the manifests

32:57.609 --> 33:01.712
There's one ship leaving
for shanghai in an hour.

33:01.714 --> 33:03.714
And guess who booked
space in the cargo hold.

33:03.716 --> 33:07.651
If that boat leaves
with the painting, it's gone.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.153
We're accessing his car's
operational mainframe. Okay,

33:10.155 --> 33:12.155
Meet us on
the 6th street bridge.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.390
We'll cut
paulson's engine.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.092
All you have to do
is arrest him.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.994
You'll find the stolen painting
in the trunk.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.996
No drama, no high-speed chase,
no risk.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.097
Okay, but

33:20.099 --> 33:21.598
Do not engage.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.300
We don't want
to endanger the public.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.202
We'll keep it safe.
Just like the painting.

33:28.106 --> 33:29.473
Use the built-in wi-fi.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.176
Happy:
Got full bars.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.177
We're in.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.279
We got control
of his car.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.453
Cutting engine power.

33:46.491 --> 33:49.359
(sputtering)

33:51.229 --> 33:53.764
(engine stalls)

33:55.099 --> 33:56.566
Raising engine temp.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.102
(hissing)

34:01.506 --> 34:02.639
(squeals)

34:02.641 --> 34:04.474
(siren chirps)

34:04.476 --> 34:05.542
(tires screech)

34:14.185 --> 34:16.053
You're under arrest.

34:16.055 --> 34:17.721
Painting's in the trunk.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.224
Agents are
en route,

34:21.226 --> 34:25.195
Another unit is apprehending
labeaux right now.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.496
Well done, guys.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.132
You sure know your tech.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.379
Sylvester:
Oh, no, the painting.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.318
That might be our fault.

34:52.623 --> 34:55.292
Something must've gone wrong
with the frequency

34:55.294 --> 34:57.627
Or the f6 diode or...
Merrick: I don't care. What I

34:57.629 --> 35:01.164
Care about is this.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.700
And you destroyed a
$100 million painting.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.874
Where are you going?

35:10.876 --> 35:14.244
Well, I told you the whole
story, so we're done.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.746
Forensic gave me
your cloning device.

35:18.316 --> 35:21.518
I carried it in my
bag, I jostled it.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.354
I even dropped
it. Not once

35:24.356 --> 35:26.423
Did the device
accidentally reset.

35:27.592 --> 35:30.760
Which is why
I find it odd

35:30.762 --> 35:33.697
That it got reset while
you were dancing with paige.

35:33.699 --> 35:36.666
It was probably
some radio wave interference.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.802
Know what I really
think happened?

35:38.804 --> 35:41.304
You enjoyed dancing with paige.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.207
Holding her.
Being close.

35:44.209 --> 35:45.775
You didn't want it to stop,

35:45.777 --> 35:48.278
So you reset the
device yourself.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.350
<i>You risked</i>

35:53.352 --> 35:55.218
The entire mission

35:55.220 --> 35:57.487
To dance with her
for 30 more seconds.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.624
I would never
jeopardize a mission.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.326
I have met with
all of your team.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.195
They rely on you,
they defend you.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.197
They're brilliant,
they're talented,

36:07.199 --> 36:09.733
And all I've ever tried
to do is protect them.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.235
Together we can do things
that no one else can do.

36:12.237 --> 36:14.671
And it's up to you to decide
whether you'll allow us

36:14.673 --> 36:17.240
To keep doing that.
Now, excuse me.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.711
Okay, so I ran
the potentialities, and the

36:21.713 --> 36:25.248
Likelihood of us passing
this test is very low.
All right,

36:25.250 --> 36:27.651
The good news is,
either way, we got this.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.352
It would pair
beautifully with

36:29.354 --> 36:31.955
A leg of lamb, but given
our higher-than-normal

36:31.957 --> 36:35.225
Anxiety levels, I think we
should pop this open right now.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.560
(door slams)

36:36.562 --> 36:38.395
Guys.

36:43.501 --> 36:44.834
You passed.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.303
Aah!
Oh.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.671
Yeah!
(exhales)

36:47.673 --> 36:50.407
Give me some.
Yeah, let's go pop this.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.309
Good idea.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.344
Enjoy.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.881
So, um...

36:59.217 --> 37:00.784
Dr. Davis thinks we're okay?

37:00.786 --> 37:02.786
Well, I wouldn't go
that far. She passed you

37:02.788 --> 37:05.889
Because, and I quote,

37:05.891 --> 37:08.525
"mr. O'brien seems
to believe that lying

37:08.527 --> 37:10.860
"to a federal psychologist
is justified

37:10.862 --> 37:13.330
"so long as the job is done.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.498
"however,
his deeper motivation

37:15.500 --> 37:17.367
"stems not, as he states,

37:17.369 --> 37:19.603
"from a desire
to complete his mission,

37:19.605 --> 37:22.806
"but from empathy
for his team members.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.774
(cork pops)
"he has created for himself

37:24.776 --> 37:26.343
"a purpose,

37:26.345 --> 37:27.644
"and for each of them,

37:27.646 --> 37:29.512
"a family.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.748
"a safe haven.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.651
A place to reach
their potential."

37:36.020 --> 37:37.420
Doesn't sound like you.

37:38.422 --> 37:39.689
That hurts.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.424
I doubt that.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.393
But it got me thinking
about some things

37:43.395 --> 37:46.396
Like when you
hacked paulson's car

37:46.398 --> 37:48.932
And it didn't exactly
work as planned.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.034
Well, technology's
not always reliable.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.769
It is when you
guys do it.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.537
So then I went down
to the evidence locker

37:54.539 --> 37:56.606
To look for the fake
painting. Couldn't find it.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.475
I don't know
how we'll build

37:58.477 --> 38:00.744
A case against paulson
and labeaux without it.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.412
This isn't the first time
they've done this.

38:02.414 --> 38:05.282
Their records will lead you to
all of their other stolen art.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.883
Your case will be airtight.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.319
And if I had forensics test
the ashes of that painting,

38:09.321 --> 38:10.987
Would it be the fake
or the original?

38:10.989 --> 38:12.989
Forensics won't
reveal a thing about

38:12.991 --> 38:16.993
<i>'cause it was completely</i>
<i>destroyed in the fire.</i>

38:30.007 --> 38:31.908
And if I were to call
the mueller family,

38:31.910 --> 38:33.710
Would they be
particularly happy?

38:35.813 --> 38:37.414
<i>Danke.</i>

38:37.416 --> 38:39.049
Thank you.

38:39.051 --> 38:42.686
Oh, don't hang it near
your window, mrs. Mueller.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.754
I'll walk you out.

38:52.930 --> 38:55.365
No one will know about this?
Not interpol.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.534
Not cabe. No one.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.069
Before, you said

38:59.071 --> 39:01.671
That painting
was meaningless.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.406
Now you broke the law

39:03.408 --> 39:06.443
To return it to its
rightful owner.

39:06.445 --> 39:09.546
I grew to appreciate its, uh...

39:09.548 --> 39:11.481
Subtle beauty and

39:11.483 --> 39:13.483
Lyrical composition.

39:14.618 --> 39:17.120
Fine. I still don't get it.
You know,

39:17.122 --> 39:19.622
I saw how duke guillaume

39:19.624 --> 39:21.891
Looked at countess stephanie.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.461
And I saw
the way you

39:24.463 --> 39:26.396
Looked at paige.

39:26.398 --> 39:29.099
Something made
you understand

39:29.101 --> 39:32.035
That family's connection
to the painting.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.903
Something.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.610
Or someone.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.386
Everything happened
like I said it did.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.522
For real.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.831
Paige:
<i>Hello? They said</i>
<i>we should come in here.</i>

40:01.833 --> 40:03.900
Come on.

40:04.802 --> 40:06.603
Hello?

40:06.605 --> 40:09.172
(laughs)

40:09.174 --> 40:11.741
I guess you don't
hate Halloween after all.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.444
Oh, we still hate it.
But we love ralph.

40:14.446 --> 40:16.646
We were hoping we could tag
along to your school party.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.982
(gasps)
toby: Hmm.

40:18.984 --> 40:21.584
My highly tuned
facial recognition skills

40:21.586 --> 40:23.520
Tell me that is a yes.

40:23.522 --> 40:24.854
Hmm. All right, let me guess

40:24.856 --> 40:25.955
Who's who.

40:27.458 --> 40:28.758
Super fun guy.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.627
No surprises
there.

40:30.629 --> 40:33.129
Uh...

40:33.131 --> 40:34.531
Sigmund freud?

40:34.533 --> 40:36.533
Ah, precisely.

40:36.535 --> 40:37.967
Which means
I'm dressed as a hack.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.704
Meow.
Every girl does that costume.

40:43.007 --> 40:44.073
And it's still hot.

40:46.911 --> 40:48.978
(soft humming)

40:50.581 --> 40:51.681
I give up.

40:51.683 --> 40:52.782
Agent cabe gallo.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.617
(laughs)

40:54.619 --> 40:56.453
Okay.
We also cooked

40:56.455 --> 41:00.056
Something up
for you.
You come with us, big man.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.090
(growls)

41:01.092 --> 41:02.559
Oh.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.497
So let me get
something straight.

41:07.499 --> 41:09.632
Art makes you feel
nothing, yet you

41:09.634 --> 41:12.469
Lied to your superiors
and risked your job

41:12.471 --> 41:14.637
In order for us to return
the painting to its

41:14.639 --> 41:18.708
You also think
Halloween is nonsensical.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.743
Mm-hmm.
And yet you

41:20.745 --> 41:22.579
Took time off work
to get dressed up

41:22.581 --> 41:25.615
And go to ralph's party.

41:27.585 --> 41:30.487
For a guy who says
he has no feelings,

41:30.489 --> 41:31.888
You sure are sweet.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.090
Eh, it's just a costume.

41:36.260 --> 41:37.494
(door opens)

41:37.496 --> 41:38.995
Oh, my god,

41:38.997 --> 41:40.563
That's the perfect costume.

41:40.565 --> 41:44.634
I thought you'd like it.
Hey, come on, we got

41:44.636 --> 41:45.702
A party to catch.

41:45.704 --> 41:48.605
You know, ralph, uh,

41:48.607 --> 41:50.006
Halloween started off as a day

41:50.008 --> 41:52.275
To ward off evil spirits.
Isn't that stupid?

41:52.277 --> 41:53.910
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:53.912 --> 41:56.679
But who cares?
Let's go get some candy.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.084
