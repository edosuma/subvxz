[applause]

00:56.458 --> 00:59.291
Hi. I'm Jon.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.166
I'm a musical-theater writer.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.583
One of the last of my species.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.958
[laughter]

01:07.041 --> 01:10.916
Sorry. So… so, you know, lately,
I've been hearing this sound.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.291
[slow ticking]

01:12.375 --> 01:16.375
Everywhere I go,
like a tick, tick, tick…

01:16.458 --> 01:22.041
Like a time bomb in some cheesy B-movie
or Saturday morning cartoon.

01:22.125 --> 01:25.875
The fuse has been lit.
The clock counts down the seconds

01:25.958 --> 01:30.625
as the flame gets closer,
and closer, and closer,

01:30.708 --> 01:33.791
until… all at once…

01:33.875 --> 01:35.666
[boom]

01:37.666 --> 01:40.083
[mimicking trumpets]

01:40.166 --> 01:42.083
[laughs]

01:42.583 --> 01:45.666
[mimicking trumpets]

01:45.750 --> 01:48.333
[woman] This is Jonathan Larson's story.

01:48.416 --> 01:50.833
Happy anniversary, I love you so much.

01:51.708 --> 01:53.666
[woman] Before the Tony Awards.

01:54.458 --> 01:56.708
Before the Pulitzer Prize.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.250
Before…

01:58.333 --> 02:01.083
We dedicate this opening night
and every performance

02:01.166 --> 02:03.250
to our friend, Jonathan Larson.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.333
-[cheers]
-[woman] …we lost him.

02:07.125 --> 02:07.958
[both scream]

02:08.041 --> 02:11.000
[woman] Everything
you're about to see is true.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.583
Except for the parts Jonathan made up.

02:20.333 --> 02:23.333
[jovial tune playing]

02:23.416 --> 02:27.250
The date is January 26th, 1990.

02:27.333 --> 02:31.916
The setting, the barren,
unfashionable no-man's-land

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
between SoHo and Greenwich Village.

02:35.083 --> 02:38.958
I have two keyboards,
a Macintosh computer.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.791
-A cat.
-[meows]

02:40.875 --> 02:43.666
An impressive collection of compact discs,

02:43.750 --> 02:46.541
cassettes, and records
of other people's music.

02:46.625 --> 02:51.958
Bookshelves sagging under the weight
of plays and novels I didn't write.

02:52.041 --> 02:55.750
I have an original,
dystopian rock musical…

02:55.833 --> 02:56.916
[tune stops]

02:57.000 --> 03:00.416
…that I have spent the last eight years
of my life writing…

03:00.500 --> 03:01.541
[deep breathing]

03:01.625 --> 03:04.833
-…and rewriting, and rewriting.
-[laughter]

03:04.916 --> 03:06.666
[moans]

03:07.208 --> 03:11.000
I have rejection letters
from every major and minor producer,

03:11.083 --> 03:14.583
theater company, record label,
and film studio in existence.

03:14.666 --> 03:16.333
And in just over a week…

03:19.291 --> 03:21.291
I will be 30 years old.

03:22.833 --> 03:26.166
Older than Stephen Sondheim
when he had his first Broadway show.

03:26.250 --> 03:30.916
Older than Paul McCartney when
he wrote his last song with John Lennon.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.916
By the time my parents were 30,
they already had two kids,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.250
they had careers

03:36.333 --> 03:38.708
with steady paychecks, a mortgage.

03:38.791 --> 03:43.541
And in eight days,
my youth will be over forever.

03:43.625 --> 03:46.041
And what exactly do I have
to show for myself?

03:47.166 --> 03:48.291

out of Jon's place.

most mornings. It's very sad.

We are not talking about that.

-[both] The Superbia workshop.

That sounds vaguely familiar.

Guys, this is the biggest break
I've ever had. This is that moment.

It's the first time people are gonna

-[Jon] But it's true, though.

It's like, you get to a certain age and
you stop being a writer who waits tables

06:11.166 --> 06:13.875
and you become a waiter with a hobby.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.083
Boo-Boo, you need to ask yourself,
in this moment,

06:16.166 --> 06:19.166

I gave… I gave my notice.

-That's exactly the same thing.
-No, I have two weeks left.

Craig Carnelia.

This is Rosa your agent,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.083
Yeah, yeah. That's the one.

07:48.166 --> 07:52.291
So she invited the entire theater industry
to Craig's musical workshop last year.

07:52.375 --> 07:54.250
And by intermission, some producer

07:54.333 --> 07:58.250
had already written him
a check for ten thousand dollars.

you didn't have to think like that.

-Hi.

10:15.125 --> 10:16.208
How was Philly?

10:16.291 --> 10:18.125
I went from the airport
to a conference room

10:18.208 --> 10:20.250
and then back to the airport
three hours later.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.500
-Sounds amazing.
-Mm.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.958
[Jon] Michael was an amazing actor.

10:25.875 --> 10:29.375
Yeah, he was the lead of every play
in high school, college.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.208
And then we moved to New York.

10:32.291 --> 10:35.000
I am sick of waking up at 5:00

10:35.083 --> 10:38.416
to get in line outside
the Equity Building and wait all day,

10:38.500 --> 10:41.208
praying that the director
actually even agrees

10:41.291 --> 10:43.500
to see anyone that's non-union, and then,

10:43.583 --> 10:46.166
when I finally do get in the room, I sing…

10:46.250 --> 10:49.291
I don't know, six measures,
if I'm lucky, before they cut me off

10:49.375 --> 10:50.708
and call me the wrong name--

10:50.791 --> 10:52.541
Juan, Pedro, Carlos… lo que sea.

10:52.625 --> 10:57.125
And then a week later, he got a job
at a fancy advertising company,

10:57.208 --> 11:00.333
making high five figures. [exhales]

11:00.416 --> 11:01.958

11:04.458 --> 11:06.250
You know, for someone who's broke,

11:06.333 --> 11:09.458
you could probably spend
a little bit less on party planning.

11:09.541 --> 11:11.833
[Jon] Well, what is the point of money,

11:11.916 --> 11:14.125
if you're not gonna spend it
on the people you love?

11:14.208 --> 11:16.666
-Yeah, except you don't have any money.
-Oh, right.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.875
This has been sitting here for a week.

11:18.958 --> 11:22.166
-I'm on it.
-Mm-hm. Yeah. You seem very on it.

11:22.250 --> 11:25.458
Pretty soon you won't have me around
to remind you to pay your bills on time.

11:25.541 --> 11:27.583
How will I ever survive?

11:27.666 --> 11:30.250
That's a very real question.
Have you found a new roommate yet?

11:31.000 --> 11:34.416
I've been a little busy. You know.
My workshop is next week.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.750
Wait, what workshop?

11:49.708 --> 11:50.833

[Jon] Susan grew up
in a small town in the Midwest.

12:16.291 --> 12:18.291
She went to college to study biology,

12:18.375 --> 12:20.500
she thought she'd become
a doctor, maybe teach.

12:20.583 --> 12:23.166

12:29.333 --> 12:31.958
She moved to New York
without knowing a soul.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.666
Four years later, she's already danced

28:36.500 --> 28:39.583
I have to say,
I disagree pretty strongly, Walter.

28:39.666 --> 28:42.791
I think this is a musical
that knows exactly what it is.

28:44.666 --> 28:46.958
Yes. Yes. Of course, yes. Abso--

28:47.041 --> 28:50.291

is really original.

28:50.375 --> 28:51.958

-Okay. Okay.

29:03.416 --> 29:06.416
Yes, yes. We're on the same page.
That's exactly how I felt.

We're saying the same thing,
just differently.

29:09.500 --> 29:12.875
But the music, okay, I'm sorry--
The music just wasn't there.

without any instruments.

30:28.208 --> 30:29.500

Let's just do the song as a cappella.

30:31.958 --> 30:34.500
Oh, actually, you know what?
Maybe we'll just skip the songs,

30:34.583 --> 30:37.666
and then we can get the audience
in and out in half an hour.

30:37.750 --> 30:39.416

1:01:45.666 --> 1:01:48.333
So, just waiting on one more person.

1:01:48.416 --> 1:01:50.250
-[tired sigh]
-Enjoy those waters.

1:01:50.333 --> 1:01:51.416
[laughing]

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:52.666
-So…
-[door opens]

1:01:53.416 --> 1:01:54.250
I'm Jon.

1:01:54.333 --> 1:01:56.708
-Yes, Mr. Larson, you're Michael's friend.
-Yeah.

1:01:56.791 --> 1:01:58.500
-How are you?
-Good. You're late.

1:01:58.583 --> 1:01:59.916
-Oh.
-Okay.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.458
-Sorry about that.
-That's okay.

1:02:01.541 --> 1:02:04.041
-No, because of the subway.
-Yeah, I'm sure.

1:02:04.125 --> 1:02:05.666
Take a seat when you can.

1:02:05.750 --> 1:02:07.041
-Hi.
-Welcome.

1:02:07.125 --> 1:02:08.583
Oh. Thanks.

1:02:08.666 --> 1:02:10.541
You sure there's no way
to get into the bathroom?

1:02:10.625 --> 1:02:12.458
Oh, no, you're not allowed
to use the bathroom.

1:02:12.541 --> 1:02:15.208
Sorry, did she mention
when we were gonna get paid?

1:02:15.291 --> 1:02:18.791
Okay, um, so now that we're all here…

1:02:18.875 --> 1:02:21.083
-Hi.
-Hey.

1:02:21.166 --> 1:02:24.583
Why don't we begin
with a quick brainstorming session? Right?

1:02:24.666 --> 1:02:28.041
Just to get those creative juices flowing.
You know what I mean? It'll be fun.

1:02:30.125 --> 1:02:31.541
Two hours of this.

1:02:31.625 --> 1:02:35.083
-For one extra musician.
-[laughter]

1:02:35.166 --> 1:02:37.958
So why don't we start
by you just throwing out some ideas

1:02:38.041 --> 1:02:41.916
when you hear me say the word "America."

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.041
-George Washington.
-Excellent.

1:02:44.125 --> 1:02:46.375
-Abraham Lincoln.
-Abraham Lincoln. Okay.

1:02:46.458 --> 1:02:49.166
Empire, racism, genocide, Vietnam.

1:02:49.250 --> 1:02:50.666
Grover Cleveland.

1:02:52.375 --> 1:02:54.375
-The Constitution?
-Yes.

1:02:54.458 --> 1:02:56.458
-Yeah.
-Magna Carta.

1:02:57.083 --> 1:02:58.166
-The Bill of Rights.
-Mm-hm.

1:02:58.250 --> 1:03:00.500
-The right thing to do.
-Ooh.

1:03:00.583 --> 1:03:04.375
-[older woman] The right stuff.
-Right stuff.

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:06.666
An open road at sunset.

1:03:09.083 --> 1:03:10.541
Wind in your hair.

1:03:11.875 --> 1:03:15.291
Nothing in your way, except horizon.

1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:23.625
That is beautiful, Mr. Larson.

1:03:23.708 --> 1:03:27.208
Wow. Okay. That goes on the board.

1:03:27.833 --> 1:03:30.708
-The sun.
-Sunrise.

1:03:31.291 --> 1:03:32.916
The dawn of a new day.

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:36.083
-Oh! Where did you come from?
-It all goes back.

1:03:36.166 --> 1:03:38.958
-You're amazing.
-That is incredible.

1:03:39.041 --> 1:03:41.041
A window looking out on a field.

1:03:41.125 --> 1:03:44.500
Oh, and I look out, and I see
the bunnies and little squirrelies--

1:03:44.583 --> 1:03:46.625
The beating heart of the nation.

1:03:47.125 --> 1:03:49.291
-Ooh!
-[director] Oh, my gosh.

1:03:49.375 --> 1:03:52.041
-Absolutely. That's absolutely what it is.
-Beautiful.

1:03:52.125 --> 1:03:55.208
-I've never even heard that before.
-You are gifted.

1:03:56.708 --> 1:03:58.500
I could get used to this.

1:03:58.583 --> 1:04:00.916
[Jon] I could get paid for this.

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.666
I could get health care. A 401(k).

1:04:05.541 --> 1:04:10.125
A BMW. A luxury apartment…
on Central Park West.

1:04:10.208 --> 1:04:12.791
-No, no, no… East.
-[laughter]

1:04:12.875 --> 1:04:18.041
I could actually be rewarded
for my creativity,

1:04:18.125 --> 1:04:21.416
instead of rejected and ignored.

1:04:22.416 --> 1:04:24.416
This could be the rest of my life.

1:04:25.208 --> 1:04:29.166
Now that we have all those
fabulous ideas of yours in our heads,

1:04:29.250 --> 1:04:32.125
we are going to turn to the task at hand.

1:04:32.208 --> 1:04:36.916
We are here to develop a name
of a revolutionary consumer product

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.208
that is just about to hit your shelves.

1:04:39.291 --> 1:04:40.500
Oh. Wow.

1:04:40.583 --> 1:04:41.791
This is where we're gonna need

1:04:41.875 --> 1:04:44.458
that incredible imagination
of yours, Mr. Larson.

1:04:44.541 --> 1:04:48.708
So the product we're looking at
is a tasteless, odorless chemical compound

1:04:48.791 --> 1:04:51.625
that will be used as
a fat substitute in cooking.

1:04:51.708 --> 1:04:52.583
Mm.

1:04:52.666 --> 1:04:57.083
And it's been successfully tested
on a number of mammals.

1:04:57.166 --> 1:04:58.958
Well, that's good. Mm.

1:04:59.041 --> 1:05:01.166
There are some side effects
associated with the product

1:05:01.250 --> 1:05:03.125
that I've been instructed
to tell you about.

1:05:03.208 --> 1:05:05.000
So it's skin scales.

1:05:05.750 --> 1:05:07.458
Um… full hair loss.

1:05:07.541 --> 1:05:10.125
-Hair, eyebrows, eyelashes…
-[ominous music plays]

1:05:10.208 --> 1:05:12.458
This could be the rest of my life.

1:05:12.541 --> 1:05:15.458
And finally, in a small number of users,

1:05:15.541 --> 1:05:18.166
there were reports
of toxic shock syndrome…

1:05:18.958 --> 1:05:22.375
resulting in a brief hospitalization.

1:05:22.958 --> 1:05:25.416
-[man] Eh, no big deal.
-There are no bad ideas.

1:05:26.125 --> 1:05:27.083
[ticking starts]

1:05:27.166 --> 1:05:29.333
-Free oil.
-Love it.

1:05:29.416 --> 1:05:31.291
-Oil free.
-Okay.

1:05:31.375 --> 1:05:35.208
-That's the same thing she just said.
-I switched the words around.

1:05:35.291 --> 1:05:37.541
[director] That's totally fine, Kim.
Thank you so much.

1:05:37.625 --> 1:05:39.458
-The American Dream.
-Okay, well…

1:05:39.541 --> 1:05:41.250
-[Kim] Dreams of freedom.
-Okay.

1:05:41.333 --> 1:05:43.666
-[man] Nutra-oil.
-That's not bad, Todd.

1:05:43.750 --> 1:05:45.750
[Todd] Waist oil. No.

1:05:45.833 --> 1:05:49.291
-[ticking intensifies]
-[dialogue fades]

1:05:49.375 --> 1:05:51.958
[discordant music builds]

1:05:52.541 --> 1:05:53.708
I got it.

1:05:54.541 --> 1:05:56.708
[laughs triumphantly]

1:05:56.791 --> 1:05:59.666
-I have it. I have the exact--
-Go, go!

1:05:59.750 --> 1:06:03.083
You wanna hear? I got the exact
right thing for this product.

1:06:04.583 --> 1:06:06.500
Chubstitute.

1:06:10.166 --> 1:06:11.875
[Michael] Chubstitute?

1:06:11.958 --> 1:06:14.375
-It's a joke.
-It's not funny.

1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:18.375
-Well, maybe not to you but--
-I recommended you, Jon.

1:06:19.208 --> 1:06:21.458
I put my name on the line for you.

1:06:22.250 --> 1:06:24.875
-Tell them I had a stroke.
-It isn't funny.

1:06:26.333 --> 1:06:27.916
This is my life.

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.541
No, it's not your life, it's advertising.

1:06:31.625 --> 1:06:33.708
It's figuring out how to trick people

1:06:33.791 --> 1:06:36.833
into buying shit that they don't want.

1:06:36.916 --> 1:06:39.000
Actually, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

1:06:39.083 --> 1:06:41.833
I don't understand how
you can take any of this seriously.

1:06:41.916 --> 1:06:44.166
-Because they pay me to.
-Money isn't everything.

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:46.833
-Well, it doesn't hurt.
-Are you sure about that?

1:06:48.041 --> 1:06:50.541
What are you doing with your life
that's so noble?

1:06:52.208 --> 1:06:55.375
-I'm making art.
-That's what the world needs. More art.

1:06:55.458 --> 1:06:59.416
Actually, yes. And at least
I'm not perpetuating a system that's--

1:06:59.500 --> 1:07:00.958
Spare the self-righteousness, Jon.

1:07:01.041 --> 1:07:02.708
You're writing musicals
in your living room,

1:07:02.791 --> 1:07:04.500
you're not saving the rainforest.

1:07:07.125 --> 1:07:08.416
[whispers] Wow.

1:07:09.416 --> 1:07:11.833
Gosh, I wish I could be more like you,

1:07:11.916 --> 1:07:14.916
and spend my life caring
about driving the right car

1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.333
and wearing the right suits
and living in a doorman building.

1:07:17.416 --> 1:07:20.375
Why shouldn't I want those things, Jon?
Not all of us have options you do.

1:07:20.458 --> 1:07:22.625
All the things that you take for granted.

1:07:22.708 --> 1:07:25.375
-What? Like what?
-Like a life with the person you love.

1:07:25.458 --> 1:07:30.416
Do you know what I would give for that?
You-- You turn your nose up at it.

1:07:30.500 --> 1:07:33.125
If that's what you want,
what's stopping you?

1:07:33.208 --> 1:07:36.833
What's stopping me? How about
Jesse Helms and the Moral Majority?

1:07:36.916 --> 1:07:39.083
How about the people
that run this country?

1:07:39.166 --> 1:07:41.541
I can't get married. I can't have kids.

1:07:41.625 --> 1:07:46.625
Half our friends are dying and the other
half are scared to death they are next.

1:07:46.708 --> 1:07:49.291
So, I'm sorry for getting a nice car, Jon.

1:07:49.375 --> 1:07:52.958
I'm sorry for moving into
an apartment with central heating.

1:07:53.041 --> 1:07:56.750
I'm sorry for enjoying my life
while I still have time.

1:07:56.833 --> 1:07:57.875
I gotta go.

1:07:57.958 --> 1:07:59.083
Hey.

1:08:00.291 --> 1:08:01.833
You wanna come take the subway?

1:08:01.916 --> 1:08:03.916
-[Michael] I'd rather walk.
-Michael.

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:04.916
Michael.

1:08:08.708 --> 1:08:09.875
[phone ringing]

1:08:09.958 --> 1:08:11.958
-[footsteps approach]
-[door opens]

1:08:14.458 --> 1:08:15.458
Hello?

1:08:15.541 --> 1:08:18.416
[woman] Johnny, darling. It's Rosa.

1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:20.125
[gasps]

1:08:20.208 --> 1:08:22.333
-Hello?
-Rosa Stevens?

1:08:22.416 --> 1:08:25.833
-Are we excited for tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

1:08:26.541 --> 1:08:28.500
The presentation.
You remembered the presentation?

1:08:28.583 --> 1:08:31.583
Remembered it?
I got every producer in town coming.

1:08:31.666 --> 1:08:32.833
-[sighs]
-[Rosa laughs]

1:08:32.916 --> 1:08:34.791
-[laughs]
-So it better be good.

1:08:34.875 --> 1:08:39.500
Yeah, it's, uh… it's gonna be amazing.

1:08:39.583 --> 1:08:42.208
Let's see if we can't get
a bidding war started

1:08:42.291 --> 1:08:44.916
on this musical of yours. What do you say?

1:08:45.791 --> 1:08:48.208
Yes, sure. [laughs nervously]

1:08:48.291 --> 1:08:50.166
Okay, doll.

1:08:50.250 --> 1:08:53.833
Charlie, get me Hal Prince on the line.

1:08:53.916 --> 1:08:55.250
Rosa? Um, I--

1:08:55.333 --> 1:08:56.833
[dial tone]

1:08:56.916 --> 1:08:58.958
[breathing deeply]

1:09:03.416 --> 1:09:05.750
[up-tempo rock music playing]

1:09:18.250 --> 1:09:19.125
[gagging]

1:09:20.458 --> 1:09:21.750
I'm so sorry.

1:09:31.125 --> 1:09:32.333
[door squeaks]

1:09:33.750 --> 1:09:35.208
Yeah. I know, I know, I know.

1:09:47.416 --> 1:09:49.000
[music stops]

1:09:49.083 --> 1:09:51.500
[kettle whistle dying]

1:09:54.666 --> 1:09:56.083
[whispers] Oh, no.

1:09:57.166 --> 1:09:59.791
Why wouldn't you have called me
to tell me my payment was late

1:09:59.875 --> 1:10:02.000
before you just cut off my power?

1:10:02.083 --> 1:10:04.291
How is--? How does that make sense?

1:10:04.375 --> 1:10:06.541
[man] Sir, as I explained before,
you received a notice--

1:10:06.625 --> 1:10:08.208
No, no, no, listen.

1:10:08.291 --> 1:10:10.500
You don't understand. I have a workshop.

1:10:10.583 --> 1:10:14.500
I have a public presentation
of my musical in 12 hours…

1:10:14.583 --> 1:10:17.166
Sir, if you are going to raise your voice…

1:10:17.250 --> 1:10:18.750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:10:18.833 --> 1:10:22.208
Look, look, look.
I can pay you over the phone, right now.

1:10:22.291 --> 1:10:25.875
-I have my credit card right here…
-The billing office is closed.

1:10:25.958 --> 1:10:28.416
I would love to figure it out right now.

1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:30.666
The billing office is closed
for the night.

1:10:30.750 --> 1:10:32.041
[breathing heavily]

1:10:32.125 --> 1:10:35.416
-What am I gonna do?
-Sir, like I've said, call--

1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:38.291
[panting]

1:10:41.791 --> 1:10:43.375
[keypad beeping]

1:10:45.833 --> 1:10:48.291
[line ringing]

1:10:48.375 --> 1:10:52.125
-[woman] Hello?
-Hey, Beth. Hey.

1:10:52.208 --> 1:10:54.666
How are you? It's Jon.

1:10:54.750 --> 1:10:55.791
Hi, Jon.

1:10:55.875 --> 1:10:58.708
Hi, um… is Susan there?

1:10:58.791 --> 1:11:00.583
She doesn't wanna talk to you, Jon.

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:03.833
Yeah.

1:11:04.750 --> 1:11:05.875
Um…

1:11:06.875 --> 1:11:08.291
Sure, sure. Uh…

1:11:08.375 --> 1:11:12.375
Well, can you… um…
can you give her a message for me?

1:11:12.458 --> 1:11:15.208
-What is it?
-Well, it's just, you know…

1:11:16.250 --> 1:11:20.333
I wanted to remind her that tomorrow
is my workshop and you know, I…

1:11:21.041 --> 1:11:24.000
I know I don't have any right to ask this.
It's just that…

1:11:25.916 --> 1:11:28.250
I would just really love her to be there.

1:11:28.791 --> 1:11:30.500
I'll tell her you called.

1:11:30.583 --> 1:11:31.916
[line clicks]

1:11:37.250 --> 1:11:38.833
[Jon] Here I am.

1:11:38.916 --> 1:11:40.250
[ticking starts]

1:11:41.125 --> 1:11:44.541
The musical to which
I have devoted my youth

1:11:44.625 --> 1:11:49.750
is about to be put on public display
for every producer in New York.

1:11:49.833 --> 1:11:51.625
[ticking continues]

1:11:51.708 --> 1:11:56.083
I haven't written a single note
or a single lyric

1:11:56.166 --> 1:11:59.625
of the most important song in the show.

1:12:01.375 --> 1:12:03.166
I have no electricity.
