Radio station I. D.

Coming to work.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.546
Joe Dirte.

01:28.630 --> 01:32.175
Don't try and church it up,
son. Don't you mean Joe Dirt?

01:32.468 --> 01:35.344
Naming you that, your daddy
must've really hated you.

01:35.471 --> 01:39.557
You're wrong, brother.
I got a good name
for this car. Rusty.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.851
Shit'll buff out.
Don't bother.

01:42.186 --> 01:46.022
Jeez, drive this piece of crap
off a cliff.
Do us all a favor.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.149
This look like a piece of crap
to you?

01:49.485 --> 01:51.527
You like them spinning tires,
do you?

01:53.363 --> 01:55.031
You suck!
You do!

02:04.333 --> 02:06.209
Did he hurt you, baby?

02:10.214 --> 02:12.131
People like that security guard,

02:12.216 --> 02:13.925
they don't really mean
what they say.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.344
They just got their own
issues and whatnot.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.638
All's I got to do is keep
being a good person.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.265
No matter what,
good things'll come my way.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.476
Everything's gonna
happen for me,

02:23.560 --> 02:25.360
just as long as I never
have "no" in my heart.

02:25.437 --> 02:29.690
Can't a guy even take a dump
in peace? Psycho.

02:31.235 --> 02:32.235
Right on.

02:33.028 --> 02:36.280
Things are gonna happen
for me. I'm Joe Dirt!

02:41.495 --> 02:43.655
I think I'm gonna go
to the restroom and
take a big Joe.

02:44.540 --> 02:47.250
Don't forget to wipe your dirt.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.919
You boys got something
to say to me?

02:50.212 --> 02:51.838
Why don't
you talk in the microphone?

02:51.922 --> 02:53.339
I got a backup mic right here.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.384
Check, one, two.
Testing, testing.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.177
Yeah, they're both working,
and guess what?

02:58.262 --> 02:59.782
They don't like no feedback.
What's up?

03:04.309 --> 03:06.352
What's going on out here?
You got to keep it down.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.271
Zander Kelly's on the air.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.107
Whoa. What's the deal
with your haircut?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.859
I'm sorry about the noise, sir.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.194
Um, this ain't no haircut.
This is a wig.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.529
A wig?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.906
Look at you. Jesus.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.576
You know what?
I got somebody I want you
to meet.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.786
Why don't you come with me?
Come on.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.873
Yeah, that's what I thought.

03:26.957 --> 03:30.418
This is Zander Kelly.
You're listening
to 98.6, KXLA.

03:30.502 --> 03:33.212
All aberration radio,
all the time.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.506
Hey, Zander, Zander,
you got to see this guy.

03:35.591 --> 03:38.426
God almighty.
Manna from inbred heaven.

03:38.510 --> 03:42.555
Hey, freak boy.
1976 called,
it wants its hairstyle back.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.182
Zander, get this.
This is a wig.
It's a wig?

03:45.267 --> 03:46.517
What are you wearing a wig for?

03:46.602 --> 03:49.186
What are you doing, stunt work
for Billy Ray Cyrus?

03:49.521 --> 03:53.691
Freddy, go get Free Bird boy
here an all-access laminate
for the show in perpetuity.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.152
I'm wringing this chamois
as long as I can.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.989
You are exquisitely pathetic.
What's your name, pal?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.343
Uh, it's Joe Dirt.
But if you're just gonna
make fun of me, man,

04:02.367 --> 04:03.659
I'll just go back to mopping.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.620
Sit down, let me take another
tact here.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.497
Mr. Dirt, what's with the wig?

04:08.582 --> 04:12.251
Well, I was born without
the top of my skull,

04:12.336 --> 04:16.255
and I guess a little bit
of my brains was showing.
It was grossing everybody out,

04:16.339 --> 04:19.257
so my mom put this wig
on me to cover it up.

04:19.343 --> 04:24.805
And then the bones grew
together and it got all
infused and entwined.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.767
I mean, I don't mean to get
all scientific or whatever.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.769
Why didn't your mom
change the wig later?

04:29.853 --> 04:34.857
Actually, we got separated
when I was eight.
I got lost.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.170
You trying to tell me
you've been on your own
since eight years old?

04:37.194 --> 04:39.862
Pretty much, man.
It's a long story, actually.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.697
Listen to you.
What's the story here?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.783
"I'm a white-trash idiot."
The end.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.970
Hey, is this where you want
to be when Jesus comes back,
man?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.954
Making fun
of poor little Joe Dirt?

04:48.038 --> 04:50.873
Probably, because
I'm sure Yahweh
would be chiming in, too.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.520
That's funny, 'cause my mom
used to say that to me
if she caught me doing stuff.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.922
Like one time, I was
jerkin' my gherkin.
Can I say that?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.967
And she goes,
"Is this where you want to be
when Jesus comes back?"

05:01.051 --> 05:04.411
She sounds like a real winner,
and it's amazing to me that
you turned out like you did

05:04.471 --> 05:06.305
with that sort of,
uh, mentoring.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.599
Hey, man, I... I can't say
don't make fun of me,

05:09.059 --> 05:10.745
but you really shouldn't
make fun of my mom.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.270
Hey, you guys,
you gotta come hear this guy
on the Zander show.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.816
Listen. You're on your own.
The family's ditched you.
What happens next?

05:16.900 --> 05:20.403
I mean, do you really care?
It's actually not an easy
story to tell.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.363
Hey, I got four hours
a day to fill, man.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.199
It's not often I get a freak
like you plopped into my lap.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.827
Go ahead. I'm a roast.
Baste me.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.245
All right, man.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.623
See, my parents and
my sister and I all went
to the Grand Canyon.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.469
And while they was
checking out the sights and
the donkeys and whatnot,

05:35.544 --> 05:37.169
I somehow got separated
from 'em.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.587
Easy shot.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.174
Ow! Hey, Dad, look.
It's the good stuff.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.969
None of that pussy
Skoal, right, Dad?

05:45.679 --> 05:46.762
Dad?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.431
Mom!

05:48.932 --> 05:49.974
Dad!

05:50.058 --> 05:52.143
Mom! Dad!

05:52.436 --> 05:53.436
Where are you?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.271
Dad!

05:56.440 --> 05:57.690
Mom!

05:57.774 --> 05:59.608
Where are you?

06:00.152 --> 06:01.944
You can come out now.

06:04.698 --> 06:09.201
So there I was. A lot of kids
would have been scared,
but I was all tough about it.

06:09.286 --> 06:13.873
I started walkin' till
the cops picked me up and
put me into a foster home.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.584
Like this one guy
I fostered out to
for about a month,

06:16.960 --> 06:18.669
he'd take me hunting
with him and his dog.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.546
I thought hunting would be,
you know,

06:20.630 --> 06:21.797
more fun than it was.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.887
Now, see, boy? He goes off
and fetches the duck.
You see how that works?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.305
Fun, huh?

06:29.473 --> 06:30.806
Yeah!

06:32.726 --> 06:36.145
After that I spent
some time with these people
who worked on a farm.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.982
I learned cows don't find
bottle rockets as funny
as I do.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.072
Yee-haw! Oh, yeah.

06:55.499 --> 06:58.167
Then there was
this one old lady,
had me for a couple of weeks.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.378
I don't wanna be unkind,
but this woman was
a little off-balance.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.464
You're to be scrubbed clean
before supper,

07:03.548 --> 07:08.219
and that means washed
under your fingernails and
back of your ears and

07:08.303 --> 07:10.721
dressed in your Sunday best.

07:10.806 --> 07:15.434
I expect your schoolwork
to be done every night and
laid out for my inspection.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.269
Is that clear?
Yes, ma'am.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.396
Uh, can I push him off my leg?

07:19.856 --> 07:22.066
He'll stop humping
as soon as he's done.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.570
Well, the year was 1982.

07:26.863 --> 07:30.324
I was 11 years old now,
and I'd gotten into a little
trouble here and there,

07:30.408 --> 07:32.201
so I was living in
a juvie home for boys,

07:33.120 --> 07:35.871
and I was getting ready
to split that scene,
and pronto.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.418
♪ Ramblin' man
Lord, I got to gamble
Gamblin' man ♪

07:41.503 --> 07:44.713
Bob Seger? Be honest.
Back then you were listening
to Leif Garrett.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.173
It's probably more like this.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.510
♪ I was made for dancin'

07:49.970 --> 07:51.554
♪ I... ♪

07:51.680 --> 07:53.556
No, sir, man.
I don't like that crap.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.516
I'm a rocker, dude,
through and through.

07:55.725 --> 08:01.313
Here's my favorite bands.
AC/DC, Van Halen, not Van
Hagar, Skynyrd, Def Lepp...

08:01.398 --> 08:05.776
All right. I want you to
settle down. Don't make me
call your probie officer here.

08:05.861 --> 08:06.986
And riddle me this...

08:07.070 --> 08:11.574
Other than the fact that you
dig looking like Jane Fonda
in Klute,

08:11.658 --> 08:13.993
why don't you cut the wig now?

08:15.662 --> 08:19.165
Well, yeah.
I guess I could do that.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.376
Zander just asked this Joe
Dirt guy why he doesn't
cut his wig right now,

08:22.460 --> 08:24.378
and you can tell
he's never thought of it.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.899
Now, you know, except
for the ratty 'stache
and the pork chops,

08:26.923 --> 08:30.467
you're pretty clean-shaven
for a kid who lives
in a trash can, no?

08:30.552 --> 08:34.513
Well, I don't need to shave,
'cause it don't grow in right
here and right here.

08:34.597 --> 08:38.475
Now, you're telling me
that you're so ingrained
with white-trash DNA

08:38.559 --> 08:43.272
that your facial hair actually
grows in on its own
all white-trashy like that?

08:43.356 --> 08:47.067
Uh, I don't know what
you're saying, but that's
what's going on, yeah.

08:47.569 --> 08:51.488
So, back to the story here.
You're on your own...

08:51.573 --> 08:56.994
I'm just kinda campin' out or
whatever, and this goes on
for years, until one night

08:57.078 --> 08:58.662
something amazing happened.

09:02.626 --> 09:07.630
Man, a shooting star.
I gotta make a wish.
I wish...

09:08.006 --> 09:11.967
I knew what happened
that one day at that
Grand Canyon place.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.057
Whoa.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.560
Whoa, whoa.

09:24.814 --> 09:29.443
Whoa. Whoa, it's a meteorite.
Whoa, check it out!
That's cool!

09:29.527 --> 09:33.322
Oh, man, look at you.
You're probably made out of
some precious metal

09:33.406 --> 09:36.408
and everyone's gonna want you,
but you want to be with me!

09:36.493 --> 09:40.079
Right on!
You're Joe Meteorite,
and I'm Joe Dirt! Whoo!

09:43.708 --> 09:47.628
Here on Earth, we call
this place a town.

09:47.712 --> 09:51.840
A town is a place
where everyone hates you.
Kids all try to beat you up.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.925
Whoa, that's so flat.

09:53.009 --> 09:53.926
Awesome.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.761
This is gonna be awesome.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.389
Holy crap, ladies.

09:58.473 --> 10:02.268
Hey, Junior Dirt Bag.
You talkin' to your rock?

10:02.352 --> 10:04.812
It ain't no rock,
it's a meteor, dum-dum.

10:04.896 --> 10:08.274
What did it do, land on your
barber's head while he was
cuttin' your hair?

10:08.358 --> 10:10.711
Why don't you go
practice falling down.
I'll be there in a minute.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.404
Hey.
You wanna fight,
you little queer?

10:13.488 --> 10:16.448
Queer? Is this queer?

10:16.533 --> 10:19.201
Are these queer? What's up?
What's up?

10:19.286 --> 10:20.721
Look at this guy.
He must be retarded.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.913
Hey, retard,
you aren't worth it.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.456
Come on. Let's go.
Yeah? You are.

10:24.541 --> 10:28.502
What a wuss.
I mean, you aren't...
worth it.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.879
I told them, meteor.
You had my back.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.050
You're cool.
Whoa, what's that?

10:37.429 --> 10:43.058
Five dollars. That's mine now.
You're my lucky meteor.
Right on!

10:43.393 --> 10:45.602
I'll hold your half for ya.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.606
Meteor, we call this here
"Bein' in burger heaven."

10:51.443 --> 10:54.111
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.909
I need to find a home, Meteor.

11:01.077 --> 11:04.121
We need some stability
in our lives, man.

11:04.539 --> 11:08.959
We need to settle down.
Life gets hard, you know?

11:29.272 --> 11:34.693
Yeah. Come on, now.
It's a little bumpy.

11:36.696 --> 11:42.117
Whoa-ho-ho.
Look at that town, Meteor.
That's pretty.

11:42.327 --> 11:47.664
I bet people in a town
like that will be nice to us.
Let's go down there.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.376
Come on.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.419
Yeah.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.799
No way I'd ever
sell you, Meteor.
Not in a million years.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.719
But just for laughs,
let's see how much
you're worth.

12:01.179 --> 12:05.015
Well, it ain't a meteor.
Yeah, it is.
It came out of the sky.

12:05.350 --> 12:10.604
Well, I'm sure it did, but it
ain't no meteor. It's a big
old frozen chunk of shit.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.064
What?
Oh, yeah.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.067
See, them airplanes dump
their toilets at 36,000 feet,

12:15.151 --> 12:17.027
and the stuff freezes
and falls to earth.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.696
We call 'em Boeing bombs.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.408
No, that can't be.
That's not what it is.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.992
Oh, afraid so.

12:24.369 --> 12:27.454
You see the peanut?
Dead giveaway.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.124
Yeah, that's... That's
a space peanut.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.959
Well, afraid not.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.795
This is a big old frozen
chunk of poopie.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.384
Dude, you were eating off it.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.096
Okay, okay, that's too much,
too much.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.180
Then what happened?

12:45.223 --> 12:46.723
Well, then I got a dog.

12:46.808 --> 12:50.436
You're telling me you'd
rather have a dog
than a frozen hunk of crap?

12:53.690 --> 12:56.692
See, it wasn't
really my dog.
It was this girl's dog.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.361
I was livin' in the woods
outside of that postcard town
I said.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.696
It's called Silvertown.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.450
And I'd come in to
steal stuff, you know,
food, whatever.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.368
And then one winter...

13:21.551 --> 13:23.886
Are you okay, boy?

13:25.221 --> 13:28.182
Oh, no. Are your nuts
frozen to the porch?

13:31.769 --> 13:34.146
Oh, that sucks. Don't pull up.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.905
Who are you?
It's okay.
I was just walking by.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.438
I think your dog's in
a little trouble here.
What's wrong?

13:45.492 --> 13:48.160
I think his...
Well, you know how when
you get your tongue

13:48.328 --> 13:51.205
frozen in a freezer
'cause it's all wet?

13:51.414 --> 13:53.081
I think he got...

13:53.625 --> 13:54.708
Nuts frozen to the porch?

13:54.834 --> 13:55.876
Yes, exactly.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.170
Oh, baby! What do we do?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.923
We got to do something, so
do you have something inside?
Yeah.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.550
Shh. Don't pull up.

14:03.927 --> 14:07.846
It's okay, don't move.
It's gonna stretch 'em more.
That's bad.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.516
No. Ow. That's...
That's wrong.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.185
That's way wrong.
Do you got, like,
warm water and...

14:13.603 --> 14:14.853
A fork!

14:14.979 --> 14:16.271
Yeah. No. Ow. What?

14:16.356 --> 14:19.691
No, no.
A spatula thing. The flat one.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.778
I'm sorry, buddy.
Just give her a second. Dang.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.696
I got it. Now what?

14:24.989 --> 14:29.368
Here's what we do.
I just pour a little water
on here. Now, you hold him.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.329
Easy.
Now, this ain't no flapjack.
Gotta go real easy.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.122
Should loosen it up
a little bit.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.500
And I'm gonna go...
I don't wanna look. I'm sorry.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.795
One, two, three, go.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.131
There.
Hey, buddy, you're free.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.633
Aw, dang.
Good boy!

14:45.301 --> 14:46.385
Good job!

14:46.469 --> 14:48.637
You might want to spray
this whole porch down
with PAM,

14:49.055 --> 14:50.495
you know, so it doesn't
happen again.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.349
Okay.
What's his name?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.102
Charlie.
Charlie.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.812
And mine's Brandy.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.313
Hi, Brandy. I'm Joe Dirt.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.439
Nice to meet you.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.607
Nice to meet you too.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.652
Brandy, get your ass
in the kitchen
and fire up that stove.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.362
You got some cookin' to do.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.323
Daddy, can we have
my new friend Joe
over for supper?

15:08.491 --> 15:11.368
What, are you nuts, girl?
We ain't runnin' no
soup kitchen here, boy.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.869
Scat! Get out of here!

15:14.122 --> 15:16.123
Long-haired hippie freak.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.214
I'll be your friend.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.758
For some reason, and
I have no idea why,

15:26.843 --> 15:29.052
Brandy always wanted
to hang out with me.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.804
And I had Charlie,
so that was cool.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.726
For the next couple of years,
the three of us
was hanging out

15:35.810 --> 15:39.605
at the farm in Silvertown.
And that was the closest thing
I ever had to a home.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.065
Till one day...

15:51.451 --> 15:53.035
Oh, Dirt, did I get you?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.995
Nah, I'm cool.
No, you're not.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.705
Where's Brandy?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.249
She's out riding her horse.
She'll be back in a minute.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.210
You guys want to play
bumper pool?
No.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.796
How does she put up
with you, Dirt?

16:04.881 --> 16:07.758
That's a good question, man.
She's great, though,
ain't she?

16:08.343 --> 16:11.553
You know, sometimes it's like
she likes me or something.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.972
Yeah, dream on, Dirtboy.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.601
A girl like that's
way out of your league.
She wants my body.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.146
No, I know, man.
That's all... That's for you.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.316
I'm... I'm not...
We're just totally friends.
She's out of my league.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.276
Don't ever forget it, Dirt.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.324
Check this out, Robby.
This is a good month. Dang.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.911
This guy's got a dash mat
for a '69 Nova
he wants to sell,

16:35.995 --> 16:39.289
and a car cover for any Dodge
from '79 to '84.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.084
Man, you don't even have a car.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.835
I know, but that's a deal,
what he wants.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.672
They're usually 80 bucks
at Checker, and this guy
wants 40, man.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.590
Hey, look at this.
Charlie, see that?

16:48.883 --> 16:51.635
This guy's selling
a Hurst speed shifter
with a pool-ball grip.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.845
One day I'll have a car
that badass.

16:53.930 --> 16:57.265
I'll be chirping gears
and pulling brodies,
going, "Rr-rr-rr!"

16:57.475 --> 16:59.953
You'll stick your head out
the window and check out chick
dogs, going,

16:59.977 --> 17:00.977
"What's up, baby?"

17:01.062 --> 17:03.021
Boy, I swear I oughta
slap you silly.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.440
I tell you what.
Why don't you practice
spittin' out teeth,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.526
'cause I swear I'm gonna...

17:07.777 --> 17:09.194
Whoa, whoa.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.537
Dang.
Dang.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.844
Hi, Joe. Come here.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.014
What's up, goat-roper?

17:38.141 --> 17:39.266
Not much, pig-licker.

17:39.350 --> 17:42.102
Watch the gun, baby.
That's how I get the gals.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.480
Come on. I'll treat you
to a Dairy Queen.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.524
Why are you being all nice?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.484
I am always nice to you,
Joe Dirt.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.487
Hey, Brandy.
Can I come too?

17:52.739 --> 17:55.657
Robby, I only have
enough money for me and Joe.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.285
Come on, Joe.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.412
Let's do it!
Come on, Charlie!

18:00.496 --> 18:01.580
Come on, boy!

18:03.291 --> 18:06.376
Oh, God. She is so fine.

18:06.669 --> 18:10.630
Yeah. One day,
I'm gonna marry that girl.

18:19.348 --> 18:23.393
♪ Ooh, something's got
a hold of me now

18:25.188 --> 18:26.229
♪ It's a feeling

18:26.314 --> 18:27.314
Stop!

18:27.356 --> 18:30.108
♪ Burnin' like a love
on fire ♪

18:33.029 --> 18:35.363
Oh, there you are.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.657
Gimme that mutt.
I'm takin' him
huntin' with me.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.118
Daddy, you been drinkin'.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.496
Ah, shut the hell up
and just give me the mutt now.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.665
Hey, if you're taking the dog,
I'll go with him.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.460
'Cause I've been
hunting before.
You, hunt?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.421
Wouldn't even use you
as a retriever.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.757
That was a good one.
All right, Charlie,
get in the car.

18:56.761 --> 19:01.348
Charlie, you mangy mutt.
Get in the damn car,
you flea-bitten,

19:01.474 --> 19:03.433
butt-lickin'...

19:03.976 --> 19:05.519
son of a bitch.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.361
Two!

19:14.695 --> 19:15.695
Yeah!

19:15.780 --> 19:18.031
What?

19:18.366 --> 19:19.950
Hey!

19:20.284 --> 19:21.660
Hey, my foot's stuck!

19:25.915 --> 19:29.084
Charlie. Charlie, come here.
Come here, Charlie.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.129
My foot's stuck, see?
See, my foot's stuck?

19:33.422 --> 19:36.258
I need your help.
I need you to go find
Sheriff Williams.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.177
Now, go on. Go bring help.
Go get help now.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.055
Go get him. Run, Charlie!
Run like the wind!

19:43.808 --> 19:44.891
Run!

19:45.977 --> 19:47.435
Run, Charlie.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.281
That stupid dog better
be bringing somebody.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.453
Your dad always hunt this long?

20:06.163 --> 20:07.330
Hey, there's Charlie!

20:07.456 --> 20:08.623
Charlie!

20:08.749 --> 20:11.751
Hi!
There's my buddy.
Where have you been?

20:15.798 --> 20:18.466
There you go, Don.
Take 'er easy.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.096
Oh, my God!

20:23.222 --> 20:24.514
There's that worthless mutt!

20:24.640 --> 20:27.517
What happened?
This is all that
goddamn dog's fault!

20:27.810 --> 20:28.894
And I'm puttin' him down.

20:28.978 --> 20:29.895
No, you can't!

20:29.979 --> 20:31.980
Guess who came back, Charlie?

20:38.321 --> 20:42.240
Joe, he's okay now.
He's in dog heaven.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.868
You gave him a great
last couple years.

20:44.952 --> 20:48.663
Well, I'll sprinkle his ashes.
They'll drift out to sea.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.875
He would've liked that.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.712
I can't do it.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.342
I'm taking him with me.

21:00.426 --> 21:04.846
Taking him with you? But...
Where are you going?

21:06.015 --> 21:08.725
Brandy, you see that moon?

21:08.809 --> 21:12.312
You don't know how many nights
I spent alone staring
at that moon

21:12.396 --> 21:16.900
wondering if at that exact
moment, my mom or my dad was
looking at the same moon.

21:17.193 --> 21:22.197
And for that brief second,
we were together again,
kind of, you know?

21:23.991 --> 21:27.035
When I was with Charlie,
I didn't miss that moon
so much.

21:28.204 --> 21:31.289
Brandy, I got a
hole in my heart.
I don't know how to fix it.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.518
I got to find out
what happened
that day at the Grand Canyon.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.835
I don't care how long it
takes. I gotta do it.

21:36.712 --> 21:42.509
But what if when you're
gone some guy asks me to marry
him, and you're not here?

21:42.593 --> 21:45.720
What's that got to do with me?
We're always gonna be
buddies, right?

21:46.055 --> 21:48.932
Well, if I get married,

21:49.308 --> 21:53.228
we might move, and
you might not know
where to find me.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.814
You are gonna make
some guy so happy.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.984
I just hope whoever he is,
he deserves a girl like you.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.489
God, that Brandy has a
nice ass, doesn't she?

22:04.573 --> 22:06.908
I mean, I get this loser
talking about the moon

22:06.993 --> 22:09.137
and walking his dog,
and all the time
I'm thinking about

22:09.161 --> 22:13.832
Brandy's well-manicured
backyard in those cutoff
shorts... Ouch!

22:13.916 --> 22:16.501
Yeah, she's cool.
Anyway, so there I was,

22:16.585 --> 22:20.005
on my own again, looking for
my parents, but I don't know
their last names.

22:20.089 --> 22:23.717
It's Dirt. Isn't that the name
on the family crest? Dirt.

22:23.926 --> 22:27.679
No, see, my last name's Dirt.
My dad made my last name Dirt
for some reason.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.682
Anyway, I just put an "e"
on it, pronounce it
"Deer-tay."

22:30.766 --> 22:33.393
It's no big deal.
It actually sounds
pretty cool.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.020
But see, I don't know
their last name.

22:35.271 --> 22:38.648
And I remember my sister
yelling it in my face
when I was growing up.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.692
That's why Dad named you
Joe Dirt!

22:40.776 --> 22:42.569
That's why Dad named you
Joe Dirt!

22:42.653 --> 22:44.821
That's why Dad named you
Joe Dirt instead of...

22:44.905 --> 22:46.698
I couldn't remember my real
last name.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.301
So I knew it was
gonna be hard to find 'em.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.617
Right, so what'd you do?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.062
Right, so then I needed
some money.

22:52.204 --> 22:55.290
I hopped a train out of
Silvertown and headed east
for the big city.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.255
Then I got lucky.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.467
I got myself
a real important job
in advertising.

23:05.551 --> 23:09.471
Molar World. Walk-Ins welcome.
There you go.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.807
Molar World. One for the kid?
Sure.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.768
Molar W...

23:15.269 --> 23:17.103
What's up?

23:17.188 --> 23:18.897
Oh, my God.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.566
Competition orange, '67.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.902
This thing's a Hemi!

23:24.153 --> 23:25.433
Ma'am, are you selling this car?

23:25.488 --> 23:28.364
Oh, yeah. It literally
just went on to the market.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.241
How much you want for it?

23:31.660 --> 23:32.869
What do you got?

23:32.995 --> 23:34.287
Practically nothing.

23:34.789 --> 23:35.849
I'm looking for my parents.

23:35.873 --> 23:38.333
They lost me
at the Grand Canyon
more than ten years ago.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.897
So all my money goes towards
that. I don't have pictures
of them or nothing.

23:41.921 --> 23:47.592
You don't even have a picture
of them? Aww. Well, my ex-
husband, before he died...

23:47.676 --> 23:49.260
Oh. I'm sorry.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.304
Nah. I killed him.

23:51.388 --> 23:55.642
He used to beat me,
so one night I just pushed him
into the wood chipper.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.769
Told the cops he fell.

23:58.687 --> 24:02.023
Good for you.
But he used to be
a police sketch artist.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.526
Oh, he was damn good too.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.195
The victims would give him
the worst descriptions,

24:07.363 --> 24:09.239
and he would draw them out
like photographs.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.282
He could do anything, you know?

24:11.408 --> 24:13.535
Like age progression and...

24:13.619 --> 24:16.621
That's it. That's what
I'll do for my parents.
How much does that cost?

24:16.705 --> 24:19.290
Oh, about 360 bucks.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.502
Then that's what
I need to make. Thank you.

24:22.837 --> 24:25.547
And I'm sorry I can't buy
your beautiful Hemi.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.799
Oh, no, you can.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.260
Give me what you got
in your pocket, and
she's yours.

24:30.553 --> 24:31.845
For real?

24:33.806 --> 24:36.057
You hear that, Charlie?
We got us a Hemi, brother.

24:37.059 --> 24:39.519
That lady gave me
a great idea.
Hey, Dirt! Dirt!

24:39.937 --> 24:43.898
Storm's coming in!
Get up on the roof and put
some bricks in the tooth!

24:44.024 --> 24:45.233
Gotcha.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.291
My tooth! My tooth!

25:01.375 --> 25:02.542
Help!

25:02.626 --> 25:04.752
Hey! Go back!

25:07.548 --> 25:09.382
I can see down your shirt.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.426
What an ass.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.720
Hey, boss, I'm goin' on a break.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.900
Hey! Airplane! Help me!

25:38.537 --> 25:41.164
Oh, that's not professional.

25:45.753 --> 25:49.881
♪ Spent the last year,
Rocky Mountain Way

25:51.508 --> 25:55.470
♪ Couldn't get much higher ♪

25:57.973 --> 26:00.099
I'd floated all the way to
North Dakota.

26:00.309 --> 26:03.478
And there I was,
scared to death, as I dropped
like a stone from the sky.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.651
Go back! Go back!

26:19.245 --> 26:21.246
But then the most amazing
thing happened.

26:21.455 --> 26:24.040
I landed next to an oil rig,
and they was hiring people.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.334
And what they paid was like
a sign from above

26:26.502 --> 26:28.169
that I was
meant to find my parents.

26:30.506 --> 26:31.506
Coming down!

26:31.590 --> 26:32.590
Hey, bro, come on down!

26:38.514 --> 26:40.598
Yeah, baby. Come on, now.
Get loose.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.852
Whoa, man, I got it.
It's comin'.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.897
I'll pay for this. I'm new!

26:48.440 --> 26:50.775
I'm new.
I don't know what to do!

26:57.199 --> 26:59.117
Hey, man, you done
with that apple core?

27:00.577 --> 27:02.245
I'm done with that fart.
You want that?

27:03.455 --> 27:06.708
Maybe if it came out of
Charlene Tilton's ass,
I'd take a bite.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.668
Yeah,
you probably like J . R.,
you queer.

27:08.752 --> 27:12.880
I saw your bumper sticker,
"Cowboys' butts
drive me nuts."

27:12.965 --> 27:15.550
Is that right?
You think that's queer?

27:15.968 --> 27:18.886
Is this queer? They're large
and in charge and lookin'
for chickies.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.264
You wanna back that up?

27:21.348 --> 27:24.475
You wanna fight?
Why don't you stick your head
up my butt and fight for air?

27:25.019 --> 27:27.312
That's it. You and me.
Let's go.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.709
You know, I would.
I'd love to beat your ass
up and down this place.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.066
I got to go back to work.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.819
Yo, Dirt. You're fired.

27:34.903 --> 27:38.531
Here's your week's pay.

27:39.825 --> 27:40.908
Dang.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.497
Yeah!

27:46.999 --> 27:49.125
What's up here?
Look down there.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.085
What's going on? Here I come.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.344
Luckily, my neck broke my fall.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.015
I guess you won the battle.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.184
- Yeah!
- But I won the war.

28:06.268 --> 28:09.103
If you're covered in oil,
don't stand next to a fire.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.359
Now that's day-one stuff.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.491
Keep that Skoal, baby.
That's what I'm talking about.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.038
So I had my 360 bucks.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.457
The next day I was gonna try
the police sketch thing,

28:29.541 --> 28:31.125
but something happened
to my head.

28:31.251 --> 28:35.004
See, I spent the night in what
I thought was an abandoned
circus tent.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.215
But I guess it wasn't no circus.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.717
I was totally bombed
on insecticide, I think.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.351
So needless to say,
I was in no shape

28:48.435 --> 28:50.603
to do anybody any good
with my recollections.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.755
The guy doing
the police sketch thought
I was messin' with him

28:53.941 --> 28:56.150
'cause my dad came out
looking like Father Time...

28:56.652 --> 28:58.277
and my mom came out
too butch, and

28:58.362 --> 29:00.321
looking way too much
like Richard Ramirez.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.246
You know, the Night Stalker?
Remember that guy?

29:04.493 --> 29:07.703
As my head cleared, I realized
I needed a different approach.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.791
Then I got a brainstorm...
Hire an Indian tracker
to help me.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.918
Man, that's a great idea.
They could find anything.

29:14.378 --> 29:17.588
It's like in the movies.
So I headed for a reservation.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.597
You want me to put
my ear to the ground,

29:26.682 --> 29:28.641
listen for hoofbeats,

29:28.725 --> 29:30.435
check for footprints?

29:30.519 --> 29:33.062
Look for broken twigs?

29:33.147 --> 29:35.398
But this is the modern age.

29:35.482 --> 29:41.779
That stuff doesn't work
anymore, which is why I had to
open this fireworks stand.

29:41.864 --> 29:44.073
I wasn't getting by
on my tracking wages.

29:44.867 --> 29:48.035
Come on.
You're supposed to be good
at tracking stuff, man.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.037
I've got to find my parents.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.915
And I've got to figure out
a way to sell more fireworks.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.876
I'm going broke
with this venture also.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.587
I see you got them
snakes and sparklers

29:57.671 --> 30:00.047
but where's the good stuff, man?

30:00.132 --> 30:03.843
Good stuff?
This is the good stuff,
snakes and sparklers.

30:03.927 --> 30:07.305
Are you nuts, dude?
You need stuff that
explodes, go boom!

30:07.389 --> 30:08.389
Why is that good?

30:11.560 --> 30:14.395
You might as well ask,
"Why is a tree good?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.898
"Why is a sunset good?
Why are boobs good?"

30:17.608 --> 30:19.275
Man, firecrackers.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.320
You stick 'em in mailboxes,
you drop 'em in toilets.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.322
You shove 'em up
bullfrogs' asses.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.115
I would never do that,

30:26.200 --> 30:27.742
'cause I'm gonna be
a veterinarian.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.452
Well, there you go.

30:29.536 --> 30:33.039
Someone shoves an M-80
up a bullfrog's butt,
blows him to pieces,

30:33.123 --> 30:34.582
he comes back to you to fix it.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.584
You win twice, brother.
It's good biz.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.963
So you're gonna tell me
that you don't have
no Black Cats,

30:41.423 --> 30:43.216
no Roman candles
or Screamin' Mimis?

30:43.342 --> 30:46.010
No.
Oh, come on, man.
You don't got no Ladyfingers,

30:46.094 --> 30:48.846
Buzz Bottles, Snicker Bombs,
Church Burners,
Finger Blasters,

30:48.931 --> 30:51.098
Gut Busters, Zip-a-dee-do-dahs
or Crap Flappers?

30:51.183 --> 30:56.521
No, I don't.
You're gonna stand there
owning a fireworks stand

30:56.605 --> 30:58.606
and tell me you don't have
no Whistling Bungholes,

30:59.107 --> 31:01.025
no Spleen Splitters,
Whisker Biscuits,

31:01.109 --> 31:03.945
Honky Lighters,
Husker Du's, Husker Don'ts,

31:04.029 --> 31:07.657
Cherry Bombs, Nipsy Dazers,
with or without
the scooter stick,

31:07.741 --> 31:09.784
or one single
Whistling Kitty Chaser?

31:11.245 --> 31:13.120
No.
Wha...

31:14.039 --> 31:17.208
'Cause snakes and sparklers
are the only ones I like.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.752
Well, that might be
your problem.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.755
It's not what you like.
It's the consumer.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.551
Whee! Lookie there.

31:26.635 --> 31:29.262
Oh, that's happening, man.
We should get bleachers
over here.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.889
People'll come
from miles around
to see this thing.

31:31.974 --> 31:33.891
Feast your eyes
on a feast of smoke.

31:33.976 --> 31:38.229
Oh, dang. It's out.
Oh, CNN's gonna turn around
and go home now.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.190
What's going on, man?
I saw a snail over there
and he said,

31:41.275 --> 31:45.236
"That thing's slow. It ain't
movin' fast. It's boring and
dull. I'm yawning."

31:45.320 --> 31:48.489
That's a snail watching that.
There's a snail
in the desert?

31:48.615 --> 31:49.991
Yeah, a spaceship
dropped him off.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.660
Don't focus on the wrong
part of the story, brother.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.161
And the snail can talk?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.956
Yeah, because they gave
him powers, the aliens.

31:57.040 --> 32:01.210
They made his little voice
box... Dude, I'm just sayin'
it's dull, all right?

32:01.295 --> 32:03.754
This ain't fun.
Look at that little
piece of char.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.465
You need explosions.
You need stuff going on, man.

32:06.550 --> 32:10.553
No wonder this thing's
going under. You got nothing.
It's wussy stuff.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.013
Well...

32:14.099 --> 32:15.641
I got these two sticks.

32:15.726 --> 32:20.229
Oh, dang. These are yours?
These are Roman candles,
brother. That's good stuff.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.983
Get this thing full
of lighter fluid.

32:24.735 --> 32:26.569
Yeah.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.865
The Roman candle.
Step back a little bit.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.286
Yee!
That's what I'm talkin' about.

32:35.495 --> 32:39.373
That's beautiful.
Beautiful? I'm looking
for "righteously kick-ass."

32:40.375 --> 32:42.668
You know what we need?
Gasoline.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.003
Yeah.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.758
Breakfast of champions.

32:48.842 --> 32:53.596
All right, you might want
to take a few extra steps
back on this one.

32:58.894 --> 32:59.894
God.

33:00.979 --> 33:06.150
Oh, man.
What did I trip over?

33:06.234 --> 33:08.527
There's something metal
sticking out of the ground.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.198
You okay?

33:13.992 --> 33:16.452
What is this thing, man?

33:16.536 --> 33:20.373
Maybe we should take it over
to that place, the laboratory
over in the next town,

33:20.457 --> 33:21.666
Los Alamos.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.751
That symbol looks very stern.

33:23.835 --> 33:27.338
Yeah, man. That's definitely
what we should do.
That's the right thing.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.964
But first...

33:30.092 --> 33:32.426
Yeah, jam that in
the gas bucket.

33:34.096 --> 33:39.141
We'll shoot fireballs at it.
We gotta step way back.
This is gonna be fun.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.444
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Look at that shit!

33:51.113 --> 33:55.241
Oh, man, we're gonna
get so busted!
Let's get out of here!

34:08.922 --> 34:10.630
What happened, man?

34:10.841 --> 34:14.885
You tripped over that object
in the ground.
You were knocked out.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.098
That thing's an atom bomb, man.

34:21.143 --> 34:22.810
I got an idea.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.688
"Canyon Rubberneckers tour bus.

34:25.772 --> 34:29.692
"The Grand Canyon's
number-one purveyor
of fine bus tours."

34:29.775 --> 34:32.610
I still don't see
why we're going to
the tour bus company.

34:32.696 --> 34:36.866
Don't you see?
All the tourists at the canyon
that day my parents lost me,

34:36.949 --> 34:38.242
they had cameras.

34:38.326 --> 34:40.911
And you can't tell me,
in all those pictures
they took,

34:40.996 --> 34:43.164
there won't be some
that accidentally

34:43.248 --> 34:45.248
have me and my parents
in 'em, man.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.127
The company'll have records
of who used the tour that day.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.045
But that was more
than ten years ago.

34:51.130 --> 34:54.049
Besides, they won't just
hand the records over to us.

34:54.134 --> 34:56.135
We're just an Indian
and some guy.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.720
Uh-uh, man.

34:57.888 --> 35:00.973
You can't have
"no" in your heart. "No" is
not an option, brother.

35:01.057 --> 35:04.685
You're not just an Indian.
You're Kicking Wing.
All right?

35:04.770 --> 35:07.396
And one day, you're gonna be
Kicking Wing, Animal Doctor.

35:07.481 --> 35:09.841
And then you should change
your name to Kicking Ass.
I would.

35:15.030 --> 35:19.450
Oh, man. Swerve them potholes.
You know, because of
the atom bomb.

35:20.535 --> 35:21.535
Ah.

35:30.378 --> 35:35.090
One swing, and this here
ball-peen hammer
will trigger this A-bomb,

35:35.175 --> 35:38.969
and it'll blow up
the whole city,
maybe even half the country.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.429
Now, here's what I need.

35:40.514 --> 35:42.681
I need you to give
me the records

35:42.891 --> 35:46.060
of everybody who toured
the Grand Canyon
on them buses

35:46.269 --> 35:48.270
June 13, 1979.

35:49.898 --> 35:54.068
I'm not messin' around.
I'll hit it. And then it
goes bang. All right?

35:54.778 --> 35:56.946
Now, while I'm up here waiting,

35:58.573 --> 36:00.115
you.
Me?

36:00.200 --> 36:02.409
Show me them boobies.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.127
Dang.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.464
Now, even you liked the way
that chick looked, didn't you?

36:15.549 --> 36:17.675
Even me?
What's that supposed
to mean, man?

36:17.759 --> 36:21.136
I'm just saying, I'm beginning
to doubt your hetero street
credentials here.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.430
I mean, never putting
the moves on Brandy...

36:23.515 --> 36:25.558
Brandy, man...
She's too beautiful.

36:25.976 --> 36:27.142
She's way too hot for me.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.894
He has no idea
that Brandy even likes him.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.940
- His voice is so sexy.
- I wonder what he looks like.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.775
You're standing there
with an atom bomb.

36:35.277 --> 36:38.195
Could be Fat Man,
could be Little Boy.
We'll nail that down later.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.322
But anyway, did you get
the names you wanted?

36:40.407 --> 36:43.242
Yeah, I did, but by the way,
it wasn't no atom bomb.

36:43.326 --> 36:48.289
Turns out, some skateboarder
slapped a Biohazard band
sticker on the side of this

36:48.373 --> 36:50.749
septic tank for an R.V.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.960
Anyway, the cops knew
it wasn't a bomb right away.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.713
Yeah. Who hasn't seen
that scenario played out?

36:55.797 --> 36:58.048
It's just an old crapper tank,
people.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.098
Kicking Wing!
Stop it.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.976
Somebody help me!

37:09.102 --> 37:10.311
Help me!

37:10.437 --> 37:11.562
Ew!

37:11.646 --> 37:15.065
Is it done?
How much is in there?

37:15.150 --> 37:17.401
I got the poo on me.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.570
You are so pathetic.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.322
They decided not even
to arrest me.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.325
They said being covered
in that stinky stuff
was punishment enough.

37:24.409 --> 37:29.663
Don't you get it, man?
Stinky stuff is your milieu.
Okay? This is your deal.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.917
You are an underachievement
nexus in the universe, and

37:33.001 --> 37:35.002
it's always gonna be
like this, Joey.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.755
No, man, but you gotta
keep going.
What am I gonna do, quit?

37:37.839 --> 37:40.299
That's not an option.
You got to keep on keepin' on.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.593
Life's a garden, dig it?
You make it work for you.

37:42.677 --> 37:46.096
You never give up, man.
That's my philosophy.
You hear that in there?

37:46.181 --> 37:48.015
You know, the thing that
drives me crazy and

37:48.099 --> 37:49.350
fascinates me at the same time

37:49.559 --> 37:53.604
is that you are so
unrelentingly upbeat
about your plight.

37:55.190 --> 37:58.817
I need more, man. I'll be
honest with you. I want to
see you in here tomorrow.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.487
I want to hear more
of the saga of Joe Dirt.

38:02.155 --> 38:03.656
All right. Thanks, you guys.

38:05.325 --> 38:06.533
All right, Joe!

38:06.660 --> 38:07.868
Yeah, baby.

You're listening to
the Zander Kelly Show on KXLA.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.270
All right.
Good morning, troops.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.689
This is Zander Kelly,
and you, of course,

39:18.857 --> 39:21.442
are careening headlong
into yet another hellish day

39:21.526 --> 39:26.363
in the tiny existence
you laughingly refer to
as your life.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.699
I'm here with Joe Dirt.

39:28.783 --> 39:32.661
Joey, the tale could not be
told in one day, and we've
asked you back today.

39:32.746 --> 39:36.957
I might say the joint
looks great. The toilets
are freshly scrubbed.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.542
The floor is spick-and-span.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.962
Hey, Joe, did you use
the stuff with the tiny
scrubbing bubbles?

39:42.047 --> 39:44.465
They clean the bowl
so you don't have to.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.884
No, I didn't.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.845
Yesterday,
provide a little back-story
for the listeners,

39:49.929 --> 39:52.723
you were telling us
that you were covered
in crap,

39:52.807 --> 39:54.058
and you are a complete loser.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.769
Have I nailed
the pertinent facts?

39:56.853 --> 40:01.815
Well, let me emphasize to
the listeners those are
your words, not mine.

40:01.900 --> 40:05.736
Sorry, Billy Jack.
So now you have
a bunch of names

40:05.820 --> 40:10.032
of people who might actually
have a photograph of you
and your parents, right?

40:10.116 --> 40:11.784
Right.
I got a big bunch of names.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.912
So now I got to span
the country to find
all these people,

40:14.996 --> 40:17.331
to see if anybody's got
a photograph
from that one day.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.835
"Anderson, Anders,
Asnov, Ast..."

40:22.087 --> 40:25.464
I mean, all these people
were on them tour buses
that day?

40:25.548 --> 40:30.260
"Belitnikoff..."
It's gonna take forever, man.
But I gotta do it.

40:30.345 --> 40:35.057
Joe Dirt, I wish you luck.
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.476
And remember that town
you're always talking about.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.936
Yeah, Silvertown, man.

40:39.020 --> 40:42.856
Yes. Silvertown.
You make it sound like
the most wonderful place.

40:43.233 --> 40:47.444
So you've always got
Silvertown.
Remember that, Joe Dirt.

40:47.529 --> 40:51.281
And you remember to keep on
keepin' on, man, and
you'll be a veterinarian,

40:51.366 --> 40:53.826
'cause I believe people get
what they really, really want

40:53.910 --> 40:55.994
especially a cool guy
like you, Kicking Wing.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.121
You know what?

40:57.205 --> 41:00.207
You're my first real friend
I've found outside of
Charlie and Brandy.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.256
Oh. Okay.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.635
That's good. That's good.

41:11.719 --> 41:15.597
That hug was
completely asexual.
He kind of snuck it up on me.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.724
Whatever you gotta
tell yourself, Joe Dirt.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.311
I love you, Joe Dirt.

41:27.694 --> 41:29.403
So I hit the road
with my list of names,

41:29.487 --> 41:33.282
looking for tourists who might
have photos of my folks.

41:33.366 --> 41:36.702
I hit pay dirt
when I got a job
with a traveling carnival

41:36.786 --> 41:38.453
and that's when things
got a little weird.

41:45.170 --> 41:49.423
♪ Come on take a little walk

42:20.371 --> 42:24.291
♪ Yeah, who do you love? ♪

42:35.678 --> 42:37.262
Dang.

42:46.189 --> 42:47.856
Can I go again? Please?

42:47.941 --> 42:50.127
No, you've been on the ride
long enough.
It's time to go home.

42:50.151 --> 42:53.654
I got you, buddy.
Who's this chick over here?
That your girlfriend?

42:53.738 --> 42:56.406
You should see my girlfriend.
You'd shit yourself.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.283
Really?

42:58.368 --> 43:00.160
Tell you what.
I'm gonna give you
a free spin.

43:00.245 --> 43:02.473
I'm gonna talk to your
lady friend over there.
How 'bout that?

43:02.497 --> 43:03.538
Yes!

43:06.292 --> 43:09.920
Good job, sir.
Yeah, keep 'em straight like
that. Good strategy.

43:10.004 --> 43:13.674
You know, the life
of a carnival worker keeps me
free and untethered.

43:13.758 --> 43:17.261
I know.
That's why I was immediately
attracted to you.

43:17.345 --> 43:18.720
I could tell you were an outlaw.

43:18.846 --> 43:22.140
Is that right?
Yeah, I am kind of an outlaw
through and through, baby.

43:22.558 --> 43:25.602
Damn.
Good toss there, sir.
Good one.

43:25.687 --> 43:28.730
You know, society's
got no hold on this outlaw.

43:29.357 --> 43:31.858
Damn it!
All right, all right.
Real close.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.696
You know, I'm like a bird.
Actually, more like
a hard-ass pterodactyl.

43:37.365 --> 43:38.532
This is bullshit!

43:38.616 --> 43:42.202
Hey, God forbid you don't win
after throwing only
two quarters, man.

43:42.287 --> 43:44.788
It's a business.
It ain't UNICEF, okay?

43:44.872 --> 43:49.459
I got a good mind to take my
outlaw ass and... Yeah, you
better walk away, hardass.

43:51.170 --> 43:52.421
Some people, right?

43:52.505 --> 43:53.588
I know.

43:55.550 --> 43:59.594
So later on, I'm pickin' up
my Hemi Road Runner.
That's right, I said Hemi.

43:59.679 --> 44:02.264
Wow. A Hemi?

44:02.598 --> 44:04.474
Balls to the wall.
Oh, yeah.

44:04.559 --> 44:06.268
I left it here.
Friend's house.

44:06.352 --> 44:10.731
Well, actually it got towed
two years ago. But I'm gonna
pick it up this afternoon.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.357
I might need
a pretty little lady

44:12.442 --> 44:15.986
to sit on the front seat with
me while I break her in...

44:16.070 --> 44:17.154
The car, I mean.

44:17.322 --> 44:19.114
What do you say?

44:19.907 --> 44:21.408
That's a big 10-4.

44:25.038 --> 44:27.956
Hey, my man.
I got a big date tonight.
I'm here to pick up my ride.

44:28.458 --> 44:29.583
License and registration?

44:29.751 --> 44:30.834
Yes, sir.

44:31.169 --> 44:33.754
She's gonna freak out
when she sees my wheels.

44:35.423 --> 44:38.550
Total impound fees
come to $3,496.

44:38.634 --> 44:39.676
Plus 35 bucks for the tow.

44:39.761 --> 44:40.761
What?

44:40.845 --> 44:43.388
Three thousand, man...
That's more than I paid
for the whole car!

44:43.473 --> 44:46.058
Oh. Hmm. Interesting.

44:46.142 --> 44:47.851
You want it or not?
Yeah, but...

44:47.935 --> 44:50.103
I think that all I got's,
like, 450 bucks.

44:50.438 --> 44:52.647
This is a business.
This is not a charity.

44:52.899 --> 44:55.233
Maybe one day UNICEF will
get into the impound business.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.778
But until then,
we're the people to see.

44:59.906 --> 45:01.365
I'll tell you what I could do.

45:01.449 --> 45:04.951
I could sell you a car
for 450 bucks, but

45:05.286 --> 45:07.412
it ain't gonna be no Hemi.

45:20.802 --> 45:22.928
I thought you had a Hemi.

45:23.012 --> 45:26.598
Yeah, I had to have a
footprint gas pedal installed.

45:26.682 --> 45:28.892
So I stole this pile.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.812
Oh. My outlaw.

45:33.981 --> 45:36.066
That's right. Let's go.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.408
So, I had fun tonight.

45:44.492 --> 45:47.619
Even though you took me
to the carnival that
I was already at.

45:48.746 --> 45:51.081
Yeah, I had fun too.
Hey, listen. Can I ask you
a question?

45:51.165 --> 45:52.249
Mm-hmm.

45:52.333 --> 45:55.627
If I told you you had
a beautiful body, would you
hold it against me?

45:55.711 --> 45:57.170
Sure would.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.131
Wanna go to my place?
Sure do.

46:03.636 --> 46:07.472
All right. Finish your story.
Why do you live
with foster parents?

46:07.557 --> 46:10.058
Well, because when I was,
like, nine or ten years old

46:10.143 --> 46:12.955
my parents pulled over
on the side of the road
to look at that big dinosaur

46:12.979 --> 46:14.604
out there in California, Mm-hmm.

46:14.689 --> 46:16.329
And the next thing I knew,
they were gone.

46:17.692 --> 46:19.128
Wait a minute.
Did you have a brother?

46:19.152 --> 46:21.111
Mm-hmm. I did.

46:21.195 --> 46:22.988
So, you wanna go back
in the house?

46:23.781 --> 46:25.198
We can have sex.

46:28.578 --> 46:31.955
She's your sister, dude.
She's gotta be. And you
made out with her, man!

46:32.039 --> 46:34.458
What's wrong with you,
you pervert?

46:35.209 --> 46:37.878
Well, I didn't know
she was my sister
when I kissed her.

46:37.962 --> 46:41.590
So it's not my fault.
And she's one of the
hottest girls on the planet.

46:43.050 --> 46:44.801
You just said your sister's hot!

46:44.886 --> 46:47.679
What a freak!
You're goin' to hell, man!

46:49.056 --> 46:51.683
I got to tell her
what happened,
why I got weird.

46:52.393 --> 46:55.812
And for God's sakes, I got to
treat her like a sister.

46:59.233 --> 47:00.233
Joe...

47:00.693 --> 47:02.652
Oh!
Joe, no!

47:02.737 --> 47:04.946
We've got questions
comin' in from...

47:05.031 --> 47:07.657
Boss, the phones
are goin' nuts.
That was a bombshell.

47:07.742 --> 47:11.077
Wait, wait, man.
I found out later that
she wasn't my sister.

47:11.162 --> 47:12.871
Oh, thank God!

47:12.955 --> 47:16.124
Thank God, dude!
That was gonna be
a little much.

47:17.585 --> 47:19.127
So I did a real bad thing there,

47:20.880 --> 47:22.839
'cause I think you're my sister.

47:24.008 --> 47:26.009
Is that all?
No!

47:26.636 --> 47:30.096
My family's last name
is Buckwalter.
My brother's name is Cletis.

47:30.181 --> 47:34.059
So, you see,
we're not related.
We can have sex again.

47:41.067 --> 47:43.443
Joe, what's the matter?
Don't I turn you on?

47:44.612 --> 47:46.988
I don't know
what the problem is.

47:47.073 --> 47:50.659
Well, would it help if you
went back to thinkin'
I'm your sister?

47:50.743 --> 47:53.578
Like I'm some sort of
white-trash perv?

47:53.663 --> 47:56.081
I'm your sister!
I'm your sister!

47:56.165 --> 47:58.208
Oh, you're my sister!

47:58.292 --> 48:00.210
Oh, no!
I'm kiddin', I'm kiddin'.

48:00.294 --> 48:03.547
I just made that last part up
for laughs, you guys,
I'm tellin' you.

48:03.631 --> 48:06.174
Let's break it off for today.

48:06.259 --> 48:10.804
You haul your mangy ass
in here tomorrow morning,
and we will continue

48:10.888 --> 48:14.891
the fascinating saga
that I'm now referring to as

48:14.976 --> 48:18.478
"The Legend of Dirty Joe."

48:42.211 --> 48:45.505
Hi, this is Brandy.
I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message.

48:46.966 --> 48:50.844
Hey, Brandy, it's Joe.
I'm out in L.A.

48:50.928 --> 48:54.139
They got me on a radio station
tellin' my story to everybody.

48:55.182 --> 48:57.809
I didn't get
to the sad part yet.

48:57.893 --> 49:00.520
I'm guessin' you had reasons
for doin' what you did.

49:02.815 --> 49:05.025
And I guess I'm just callin'
to say goodbye.

49:06.819 --> 49:08.945
I miss you, Brandy.

49:09.905 --> 49:11.197
Okay.

49:22.543 --> 49:26.087
You're listening to
The Zander Kelly Show on KXLA.

49:26.172 --> 49:29.174
Good morning, L.A.
Zander here.
We're sittin' with

49:29.258 --> 49:31.968
the king of all dirt-balls,
Mr. Joe Dirt.

49:32.053 --> 49:35.305
You know, last night
when I went home,
rented The Andromeda Strain,

49:35.389 --> 49:39.309
just so I could simulate
immersion into that
bacteriologically unsound

49:39.393 --> 49:41.770
world you call
your day-to-day life.
And I feel like

49:41.854 --> 49:44.564
I know where you live.
I've got you
in my crosshairs now.

49:44.649 --> 49:47.275
Uh, we're gonna go
back to your story,
pick it up.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.028
What really happened was,
I had a car now

49:50.112 --> 49:52.947
so I left the carnival
and kept runnin' down
the names on my list

49:53.032 --> 49:55.700
lookin' for people
who took those photos
at the Grand Canyon.

49:55.785 --> 49:58.244
Somewhere in Indiana
I hit a little snag.

49:58.412 --> 50:01.748
I found a guy
who had pictures, but he
turned out to be a freak.

50:03.125 --> 50:07.295
I guess this is the place.
Buffalo Bob's
kind of a weird name.

50:07.380 --> 50:10.590
But people say Joe Dirt's
a weird name,
and how cool am I?

50:11.467 --> 50:12.676
Excuse me, sir.

50:12.802 --> 50:14.010
Hey, there, young fella.

50:14.095 --> 50:17.055
Hey. I'm lookin' for a guy
named Buffalo Bob.

50:17.139 --> 50:19.641
Real name's Tim.
How can I help you?

50:19.725 --> 50:22.454
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about the time you went
to the Grand Canyon.

50:22.478 --> 50:26.064
Sure.
Why don't you come on inside?
What'd you say your name was?

50:26.148 --> 50:27.482
Joe Dirt.

50:29.110 --> 50:30.735
Joe Dirt.

50:30.820 --> 50:32.320
It puts the lotion on!

50:32.947 --> 50:36.032
You have no idea what kind
of hell I can bring you!

50:36.117 --> 50:37.701
Oh, all right!

50:37.785 --> 50:41.996
Enough, you broken record!
Okay! I've been down here
for two weeks, man.

50:42.081 --> 50:43.206
What do you want?

50:43.290 --> 50:46.209
It puts the lotion
on its skin, now!

50:46.293 --> 50:49.921
Well, say it, don't spray it,
brother! Dang.

50:50.005 --> 50:51.131
I need a towel now.

50:51.215 --> 50:53.133
It does what it's told!

50:55.136 --> 50:58.555
There. Look. I'm puttin'
the lotion on the skin.

50:58.639 --> 51:02.058
I'm rubbin' it in.

51:03.811 --> 51:07.230
Hey, to tell you the truth,
brother, between you and me,

51:07.314 --> 51:10.275
that thing with the dog
is comin' off a little fruity.

51:11.485 --> 51:13.611
That's just me talkin'.
I don't...

51:13.946 --> 51:15.363
Where's my supplies?

51:15.448 --> 51:18.032
Yeah. Come on, man.
I thought we had a deal.

51:18.117 --> 51:21.286
Aw, for Christ's sake!
Here!

51:21.370 --> 51:24.622
Ha-ha-ha!
Whee, Auto Trader!

51:25.249 --> 51:27.292
Ooh, August.
I don't got this one.

51:27.376 --> 51:30.628
There's some deals in here.
Oh, check this out.
A '71 'Cuda,

51:30.713 --> 51:32.255
plum crazy purple.

51:32.339 --> 51:34.257
This guy wants 14 grand.

51:34.341 --> 51:35.925
What?

51:36.010 --> 51:39.471
I'd give him 7,500.
I used to have one of these.
This guy's crazy.

51:39.555 --> 51:42.766
We've got
the place surrounded. Come out
with your hands in the air.

51:42.850 --> 51:44.017
Uh-oh.

51:45.895 --> 51:48.438
Hey, a little help?
There he is, boys!
Get him!

51:48.522 --> 51:50.482
Get him!
Man in the hole.

51:51.525 --> 51:52.901
Down here.

51:53.027 --> 51:54.402
Stay on your back!

51:54.487 --> 51:55.987
I hear people.

51:57.364 --> 52:01.201
Hey, it puts the Joe Dirt
in the hole.

52:02.453 --> 52:05.663
Yeah, he was gonna
flay you alive, then use
your skin to cover himself

52:05.748 --> 52:07.874
like a Joe Dirt trench coat.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.375
Oh, yeah?
That's gross, man.

52:09.460 --> 52:11.878
I think these are pictures
from the Grand Canyon.

52:11.962 --> 52:14.149
Yeah, he's been takin'
hundreds of photos
over the years,

52:14.173 --> 52:15.799
lookin' for skin that he liked.

52:15.883 --> 52:17.652
Then he was gonna
wear the skin around the house

52:17.676 --> 52:19.596
with his wiener tucked under,
kinda like a woman.

52:20.012 --> 52:21.638
That's sick, man.

52:21.722 --> 52:24.224
I think that's little me
in the garbage can!

52:25.392 --> 52:28.728
No way. And that's my...
my dad and my mom.

52:28.813 --> 52:29.896
And this is our car,

52:30.898 --> 52:33.566
and it's got...
Louisiana plates.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.985
Hell, yeah, I'm going
to Louisiana, brother!

52:41.450 --> 52:44.452
So, I cruised down south
to New Orleans and
found a base of operations

52:44.537 --> 52:47.163
for my search
at a local grade school.

52:47.248 --> 52:48.957
I was gonna be a janitor.

52:49.792 --> 52:53.586
Mostly mopping.
Once in a while you got
a problem with the boiler.

52:53.671 --> 52:56.297
You have to hit it
with a hammer,
but it's a good job.

52:56.382 --> 52:58.800
That's all right.
I appreciate this job, man.

52:58.884 --> 53:02.512
This'll be a good base
for me here in Louisiana
while I look for my parents.

53:02.596 --> 53:04.180
I got a picture of 'em.

53:10.563 --> 53:12.856
I don't recognize them.

53:12.940 --> 53:15.942
If you find them, are you
gonna tell 'em
what happened to you?

53:17.736 --> 53:21.447
Oh. That Buffalo Bob thing?
There's not much to tell.

53:21.532 --> 53:25.577
I heard some things.
It's not good.
He's a bad guy.

53:25.661 --> 53:27.871
What... What exactly
did you hear?

53:27.955 --> 53:30.123
The past is past,
the future's now.

53:31.292 --> 53:33.960
That's true.
Amen to that.

53:34.753 --> 53:37.297
Clem, are you from
around here? 'Cause
your accent sounds like

53:37.381 --> 53:38.756
New York or somethin'.

53:38.883 --> 53:40.216
No. I'm from here.

53:40.301 --> 53:43.595
Born and raised.
No, not here.

53:43.679 --> 53:45.388
Over in Kansas.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.475
Is this your wife?

53:49.643 --> 53:50.894
Ex-wife.

53:50.978 --> 53:52.770
She was shot six times.

53:52.855 --> 53:55.148
New York City.
I mean, Kansas.

53:57.151 --> 54:01.529
She was somethin'.
Her eyes were somethin'.
Azure, you know.

54:01.614 --> 54:04.198
Honey-blonde hair.
Her body...

54:05.492 --> 54:08.202
Her legs went on for days.

54:08.287 --> 54:13.249
If she was here right now,
maybe we'd have a house
with a little fence

54:13.334 --> 54:15.835
up in Silvertown,
that place you talk about.

54:16.128 --> 54:17.545
That's a nice place.

54:19.381 --> 54:22.050
You, uh...
you really loved her, huh.

54:22.134 --> 54:23.593
You might say that.
Yeah.

54:23.886 --> 54:27.180
Clem, a kid puked in
the cafeteria again.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.807
We need a cleanup right away.

54:29.892 --> 54:31.142
I'm on it!

54:34.063 --> 54:35.104
That's you.

54:35.189 --> 54:36.189
Oh.

54:38.567 --> 54:42.111
Whoa!
Hey, I'm Joe.
Where's the throw-up?

54:42.196 --> 54:44.113
Over there in the middle
of the lunch room.

54:44.198 --> 54:46.824
Hey, I'll get that cleaned up
lickety-split.

54:46.909 --> 54:49.953
Speakin' of lickety-split,
let's meet up later,
see what's goin' on.

54:50.037 --> 54:52.455
I'm kiddin'.
But seriously, let's hook up.

54:52.539 --> 54:56.000
I'm new in town, kinda lonely,
lookin' for my parents.

54:57.127 --> 54:59.545
Yeah. Well, the puke pile's
right over there.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.798
It's a pretty big pile of puke.

55:01.882 --> 55:04.217
So, clean the puke.
Okay.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.221
Well, well, lookie here.

55:09.598 --> 55:11.766
Corn off the cob.

55:14.144 --> 55:15.937
This kid should get
his money back.

55:16.063 --> 55:19.816
Look! The janitor's
gonna eat the puke!
They're hilarious, huh?

55:19.900 --> 55:22.485
I assure you I won't.
I'm a vegetarian,
and it looks like

55:22.569 --> 55:23.903
there's some meat in there.

55:24.905 --> 55:28.116
I like kids.
They seem to like...

55:28.200 --> 55:29.867
They seem to like me.

55:34.373 --> 55:36.874
I'll try the old
reverse psychology.

55:38.627 --> 55:41.587
I like gettin' hit with
hot dogs.
It don't bother me none.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.715
Oh! Stop it!

55:44.550 --> 55:46.968
I guess I'm lucky it wasn't
hot chili day today.

55:48.262 --> 55:49.595
Aah!

55:49.888 --> 55:52.306
Okay, class, let's hear
what these results are.

55:52.391 --> 55:55.852
If my calculations
are correct,
this will create ice.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.813
Oh, no!

55:58.939 --> 56:01.441
Killer mustard gas!

56:09.366 --> 56:11.409
What'd you say?
Whoa.

56:12.786 --> 56:14.871
You're talkin' to me
all wrong. It's...

56:15.748 --> 56:17.290
It's the wrong tone.

56:17.916 --> 56:21.210
You do it again,
I'll stab you in the face
with a soldering iron.

56:21.295 --> 56:22.587
Is that right?

56:22.671 --> 56:24.881
Let me ask you somethin', huh.

56:26.383 --> 56:28.134
Does your mother sew?

56:29.219 --> 56:30.845
Boom!

56:30.929 --> 56:33.097
Get her to sew that!

56:38.062 --> 56:39.312
Whoa!

56:39.813 --> 56:43.066
You'd think those stupid
punks could come up with
somethin' funnier than

56:43.150 --> 56:45.735
"Don't eat it! Don't eat it!
Here's a hot dog!"

56:53.911 --> 56:56.037
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, what's goin' on, man?

56:56.121 --> 56:57.663
Did you kick their asses?

56:57.748 --> 56:59.415
He saved us from
the mustard gas.
Whoa.

56:59.500 --> 57:00.540
You saved our lives, Clem.

57:00.626 --> 57:01.626
Whoa!

57:01.668 --> 57:04.545
Not me!
That's the guy!

57:04.671 --> 57:08.132
No, you're the one
that carried us out.
Shut up, you hard-on.

57:08.842 --> 57:11.010
That's the guy!
That's the hero!

57:11.095 --> 57:14.180
All right, well, then,
thank God for Joe Dirt.

57:14.264 --> 57:15.389
Oh, no, man, It wasn't me.

57:15.516 --> 57:16.641
That's Joe Dirt!

57:16.725 --> 57:18.017
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!

57:18.185 --> 57:19.435
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!

57:19.520 --> 57:22.647
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!

57:24.191 --> 57:26.359
Come on, Joe Dirt!

57:26.443 --> 57:28.319
How does it feel
to be a hero, Joe?

57:28.403 --> 57:30.988
Over here, Mr. Dirt.
Oh, uh, well, it's like this.

57:31.073 --> 57:35.827
Probably feels good,
especially after that brutal
run-In with Buffalo Bob.

57:35.911 --> 57:38.496
I don't know why you
ask about that guy.
Nothin' happened.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.997
That's not what I heard.

57:40.082 --> 57:42.125
What's the deal with
your haircut, Joe?

57:42.209 --> 57:44.460
It's a wig. I was born
without the top of my skull.

57:44.545 --> 57:47.171
Everybody, I'm lookin'
for my parents.

57:47.256 --> 57:51.092
Here's a picture of them.
It's taken 15 years ago
at the Grand Canyon.

57:51.176 --> 57:54.887
If anybody has any information
on the whereabouts of 'em,

57:54.972 --> 57:58.307
please call this number, okay.
You might get a machine.

57:58.392 --> 58:01.435
But if a girl answers,
her name's Brandy.
Give her your info.

58:01.520 --> 58:04.230
I appreciate any help I can get.

58:04.356 --> 58:07.275
That bein' said,
here's the real scoop.

58:07.359 --> 58:09.193
I ain't the guy
that saved them kids.

58:09.278 --> 58:11.362
Oh, my God.

58:11.446 --> 58:13.948
I'm sorry, man.
Here's the real hero.

58:15.033 --> 58:17.952
His name's Clem Doore,
and he's from Josette,
Louisiana.

58:18.245 --> 58:19.495
He's a friend of mine.

58:19.621 --> 58:20.830
Oh, no.

58:20.914 --> 58:23.124
He's your real hero,
people, not me.

58:27.921 --> 58:30.548
Let's go. Come on, come on.
Move it, move it.

58:30.632 --> 58:34.510
Move your asses. Come on.
Okay, this is where
that rat bastard lives.

58:34.595 --> 58:36.762
You two shoot him low,
you shoot him high.

58:36.847 --> 58:39.367
I'm gonna shoot him
right through his heart.
All right, let's go.

58:40.434 --> 58:43.311
Come on, let's move it!
Kick it in! Kick it in!

59:01.747 --> 59:03.581
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:03.707 --> 59:06.042
What happened here?
Don't I know you
from somewhere?

59:06.126 --> 59:07.793
I don't know. What's goin' on?

59:07.878 --> 59:10.481
Wait a minute, yeah.
You're that guy that had
that run-In with that

59:10.505 --> 59:12.298
psycho over in Indiana.
Buffalo Bob, right?

59:12.674 --> 59:15.885
Yeah. It was really
no big deal.
No big deal?

59:16.470 --> 59:17.720
That's not what I heard.

59:17.846 --> 59:19.096
Is Clem all right?

59:19.181 --> 59:20.640
No, he's dead.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.099
He's dead?
Man, what happened?

59:22.184 --> 59:25.394
Your buddy Clem's real name
was Anthony Benedetti.

59:25.479 --> 59:28.522
He was the former boss of
the Cammalleri crime family.

59:28.607 --> 59:31.776
He was in town here
on the Federal witness
relocation program.

59:31.860 --> 59:32.985
What?

59:33.070 --> 59:34.797
He turned informer when the
Syndicate executed his wife.

59:34.821 --> 59:37.490
His old cronies must've
somehow found he was down
here

59:37.574 --> 59:39.742
and they came and killed him.

59:39.826 --> 59:41.577
He killed all them too.

59:41.662 --> 59:43.621
Uh, it's a big mess.

59:46.083 --> 59:48.626
Oh, my God, man.
This is my fault.

59:48.710 --> 59:50.670
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!
Whoa, whoa.

59:52.464 --> 59:55.174
Can you be cool and let me
just talk to him
for a second here, man?

59:55.717 --> 59:57.718
He's a friend of mine.
This whole thing's my fault.

59:57.803 --> 59:59.595
All right, go ahead.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.407
Clem, I didn't know you didn't
wanna be on TV.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:05.309
I was just tryin' to get the
word out about my parents,
man. I'm so sorry.

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:07.478
But maybe you'll find
your wife in heaven.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:10.398
She'll be just how
you remembered her.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.566
Them big doe eyes.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:16.153
That soft honey-blonde hair.

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:19.240
Smooth tan skin.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.285
Huge pert rack.

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:26.497
Long legs goin' up
to that tight butt.

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.001
Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.547
Clem, you asshole.
Are you alive?

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:39.468
Shh. They're pretending
I'm dead so's they
can move me.

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:42.722
I just didn't know
you were in this witness
protection thing, brother.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.849
I never would have said
your name on TV, man.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:47.977
It's okay.
I felt it was time to move on
anyway, you know.

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:51.522
Maybe find a better town.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:56.944
Joe, there's somethin'
you should think about.
I was thinkin' about that car.

01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:59.488
The Rambler wagon.
That's a rare car.

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:03.159
People would remember
selling a car like that.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.910
Where's that dead guy?

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.954
Wait, wait, Joe.
Wait.

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:09.874
Take care, Joe Dirt.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.044
Whoa. Watch my hair.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:18.966
Yep, those came with
a six-cylinder 258 automatic
with three on the tree.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:21.427
Sweet-lookin' little things,
weren't they?

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.596
For sure, man.
How many?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.681
Well, that's what
I'm tryin' to call up here.

01:01:25.766 --> 01:01:30.311
Now let's see.
In Louisiana, 1968, we sold...

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:33.773
Wee, doggy! Seventy-three
of those little buggers.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:37.568
Now you tell me your daddy's
name, and I'll tell you the
dealership where he bought it.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:41.197
That's just it.
I don't know his name. That's
what I'm tryin' to find out.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:43.240
Oh. Well, then...

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:49.121
The best I can do is give you
a printout of all 73 people
who bought the car.

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:53.626
Later, if you come up with
their last name, you can
go on from there.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:58.214
By the way, I'm only doin'
all of this 'cause I heard
that Buffalo Bob guy shoved

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:00.925
a road flare up
your bunghole.
What?

01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:05.638
Hoorah.
What... I keep hearin'
about this guy.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.682
Nothin' happened with him.
Nothin' weird. Nothin'.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:13.062
Anyway, that list had
names from all over the state.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.981
But I was flat broke.
I didn't have no money
for gas.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.485
So, I found a job, and that
led to the biggest break
In my case yet.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.488
I don't know, Joe.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:27.201
The way you describe that
town out in the northwest,
Silvertown.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:29.829
Hell, I have half a mind
to move there myself.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:32.081
Can I ask you a question?

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:33.416
Sure, honey. Shoot.

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:36.502
Your mom and dad still alive.

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:38.337
No.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.006
Did they die?

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:46.595
One night, they got
swallowed up by the biggest
damn gator we ever had.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.805
No.

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:49.849
Before they died,
they killed that gator

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.768
from the inside by punchin'
out his heart, is my guess.

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:53.936
That's brutal.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.146
The brutal part?

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.606
Later that night, I took
my mama's hedge clippers

01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:00.234
and cut open that gator
and pulled my folks
out of its belly.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.821
See, I just couldn't stand
the thought of my parents

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:06.073
being turned into
alligator shit.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.160
God, I hate these nasty things!

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.663
Hurry up, Phillip.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.039
If I met the right man...

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:20.588
I mean, hell, I'd just shut
this old gator farm
down and...

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.717
But, you know,
you probably don't wanna
hear all my problems, huh.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:28.596
Folks,
grab the kids. The gator
show's about to start.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.223
Yeah. Well, I'd better go.
It's show time.

01:03:35.187 --> 01:03:39.064
There's three things
to remember when dealin'
with a deadly alligator.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:41.817
And, yes, they are deadly.
Don't kid yourself.

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:45.654
Rule number one, I'm number one.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.866
You hear that?
I like to kid around.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:51.952
Rule two.
The croc's number two.
Now, before I begin...

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.207
Hey, what's rule three?
What's that?
Kid, give me a break now.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.583
So, you don't know rule three?

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.001
Yeah, you want a match.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:02.004
My face and your ass.
How about that, friend, huh.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:05.549
I mean, your ass and my face.
What's up? Here we go.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:09.386
I'm a bit of a crocophile,
so don't try this at home.

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:13.682
This here's Rocky,
and he ain't no puppy.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:18.187
Now, let's see if Rocky's
got some cavities.
Ahh.

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:24.401
Now, this mofo knows
not to mess with
Sir Joseph Dirt.

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:28.197
Aah! You didn't listen to me!

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:30.157
Aah! Aah!

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:35.329
Rocky! Rocky! No!

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:37.498
Come on, eh.
Rocky!

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.668
Rocky!
Oh!

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:44.213
Aah! Aah!

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:50.636
Oh, when bad pets go bad, dang!

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.931
Oh, Joe, are you all right?

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:02.731
It's like the cartoons.
I'm seein' all tweet-tweet.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.526
Joe, what can I do for you?

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.153
You're not makin' any sense.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.947
Not makin'?

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:12.741
Not makin'?

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:17.413
That's why Dad named you
Joe Dirt instead of Nunamaker!

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:20.958
Nunamaker!
Nunamaker!

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:25.087
That's what my sister said
on the way to the
Grand Canyon.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:28.257
My last name's Dirt,
her last name's Nunamaker!

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:30.175
That's my parents' last name!

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.680
I checked my list
of Rambler wagons,
and there it was, Nunamaker.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.765
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.727
I was finally home.

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:49.445
Sir.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:52.531
Hey, Mister, you know
the people who live here,
Nunamaker?

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:55.200
They moved.

01:05:55.327 --> 01:05:56.368
What's that?

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:57.745
Moved!

01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:01.707
They moved. 'Bout 15 year ago.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:05.544
Had a little boy.
Had exact kind of haircut
you got now.

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:10.549
Damn, you outta date, boy.
Yeah, man. That little boy,
that's me.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:13.927
My parents were...
This was my home.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:17.348
I thought this was it this time.

01:06:17.432 --> 01:06:19.808
Nah. Home is where
you make it.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:22.645
You like to see homos naked?

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.230
Home is where you make it.

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:28.984
You like to see homos naked.
That's cool, man. Whatever.
No, no, no, no, no!

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:31.654
Home is where you make it!

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.072
Home where you make it.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.573
Oh.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.701
Everybody know that.
Goddamn, boy.

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:42.206
Guy likes to see homos naked.
That don't help me.

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:55.386
So, there I was,
right back where I started
all those years ago,

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.680
and no closer
to findin' my parents.

01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:03.644
And I think a little part
of me died right there.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:06.772
But you know that saying,
"Things get the darkest
before dawn"?

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:12.861
I thought I had broken my ass
bone.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:15.739
So, I tried not to move.
And I'm lyin' there
starin' at the moon,

01:07:15.824 --> 01:07:19.535
and for the first time
in my life, I think about
not gettin' back up.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:22.162
Maybe I'll just lie there for
the rest of my life, you know.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:25.958
But then, suddenly,
while starin' up at the moon,

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.546
I had this strange feeling
that exact moment,

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.631
Brandy was starin'
at that same moon.

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:34.466
And we were together.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.052
And just then,
all the tumblers
fell into place.

01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:41.140
And this door opened
in my head, and all at once
I understood everything.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.559
You have to find the real
answer inside yourself.

01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:46.645
And the answer for me was
that I had a home all along,

01:07:46.855 --> 01:07:51.400
with a friend that really
cared about me. Brandy.
I missed her like crazy,

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:55.195
and I decided
it was time to go home.
My search was over.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.998
Brandy, wish I hadn't
gotten the machine.
It's me, Joe.

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:09.001
I got some crazy stuff
to tell you,

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:13.255
but the most important part is
I'm comin' back to Silvertown.
I can't wait to see you

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:16.258
- and tell you everything.
- Brandy, I...

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.051
Message deleted.

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:37.738
Yeah! Whoo!

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.459
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.754
Well, well, well.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.424
If it isn't dirty Joe Dirt.
Hey, Robby,
what's crappenin'?

01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:00.803
Don't get smart with me,
you motherless dirtbag!

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:02.095
You been here long enough.

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:03.471
I'm here to see Brandy.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:08.352
Brandy? My Brandy? You haven't
heard? Me and her are
gettin' married.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:11.188
Yeah.
And besides, she don't
wanna see you anyway.

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:12.272
I don't believe that.

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:13.398
Well, it's true.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:15.692
She found your
stupid parents.
What?

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:19.154
Yeah, she found 'em
down in California.
But she didn't wanna tell you,

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:22.073
'cause she wants you gone,
out on the road
lookin' for nothin',

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:26.411
so you won't be here.
She's sick of all your crap.
She's sick of helpin' you.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:30.624
And she's just plain
sick of you.
No, she wouldn't do that.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:33.167
I know Brandy.
She wouldn't not tell me about
my parents.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:34.837
I don't care how sick of me
she is.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.421
Yeah well, check out
this note she left me.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.633
In case you called
and I answered the phone.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.595
"Dear Robby,

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:46.932
"if Joe calls,

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:49.852
"don't tell him

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:53.939
"I found his parents.

01:09:55.066 --> 01:09:58.610
"I'll be back
in a few days."

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:03.490
See, she signed it
right there.
"Brandy. XOXO."

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:07.661
That's right, Dirt.
Nobody wants you in this town.

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:09.496
Nobody wants you around, period!

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040
Aww.

01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:14.918
Look at him, fellas.

01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:17.379
You cryin', boy?
You cryin', boy?

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:21.466
Maybe we'll go to McDonald's
and get you a whaa-burger
and some French cries!

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:27.306
How about a Whineken?
You little sissy boy!
Def Leppard sucks!

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.399
For the record,
I wasn't crying'.
There was dirt in my eyes.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:40.152
Joey, it's not cuttin' it,
man. It's jive.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:42.946
My story no, man.
Everything I said is true.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:45.574
No, not your story.
Brandy. Brandy is jive.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.327
And I wanna get her
on the phone right now.
I wanna track her down.

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:51.079
And I wanna ask her
why she was playin'
these games with you.

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:52.683
No, man. You don't need
to bother her none.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.333
Freddy?
Freddy, get line 3 on speaker.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.251
No. You know what,
guys, I'm fine.

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:59.588
Everything's cool with me.
I got a place up in Malibu,
I got lots of friends.

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:03.842
I do worry about you, man.
You know why? Because you're
livin' In a boiler room, Joe.

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:05.427
Yeah, I got a couple places.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:10.265
You know what, Joey?
I think you... You know what,
I can't believe I'm sayin'...

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:14.394
I think we need some
resolution here.
We need a little closure.

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:17.105
I wanna get this woman on the
phone, and I wanna
ask her what

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.858
the hell was goin'
on back then.
Did she find your parents?

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:23.737
Did she ever track 'em down
and if she did, well, why
couldn't she have called you?

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:26.156
Hello.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.620
Well, well, well,
the famous Brandy, Tokyo
Rose of the trailer park.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:35.415
Hey, Brandy, I'm sittin' here
with a friend of yours,

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:39.294
a little white-trash treasure
that you might know
by the name of Joe Dirt.

01:11:39.379 --> 01:11:41.213
- Ring a bell?
- Joe?

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:44.341
Yeah, Joe.
And I don't think he wants
to talk to you, Brandy.

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:48.011
And you know why?
'Cause over the last
few days, my listeners

01:11:48.096 --> 01:11:50.597
and I have heard
an amazing story.

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:54.101
You know what? When he first
started this story, I thought
of you as a good person.

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:57.354
But the more it rolled on
down the road,
I'm not sure you are

01:11:57.438 --> 01:12:00.941
a good person, Brandy.
Why didn't you tell him
you'd found his parents?

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:05.487
Oh, my God.
How'd he find out?

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:08.448
So the letter Robby
showed Joe is true?
You wrote that?

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:11.159
Yes, I wrote that letter,

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:14.246
because I wanted
to tell Joe in person.

01:12:15.123 --> 01:12:17.207
And months went by,
and he never came home.

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:20.085
Joe, I did find
where your parents were.

01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:23.964
Joe, brace yourself for this.

01:12:26.217 --> 01:12:28.468
Your parents are dead, Joe.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.763
They died that day
at the Grand Canyon.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:34.141
Their car was hit
by a passin' truck,
a hit-and-run.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:38.729
I'm so sorry,
but your search is over.

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:43.734
Come home, Joe,
so I can take care of you.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.113
Oh, man.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:54.077
I gotta go.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.203
Sure.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:57.914
Thank you.

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:03.462
All right, we'll, uh...
We'll take a break.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:16.475
Yeah, he's Joe Dirt!

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:21.688
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!
You rule, Joe!

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:31.531
You rule!
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!
Joe Dirt!

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:35.494
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!
Joe Dirt!
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:44.211
The phenomenon
of Joe Dirt has captured

01:13:44.295 --> 01:13:47.756
the city's imagination.
The little man,
the ordinary person

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:51.843
who endured
enormous adversity,
and all the while maintained

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:56.264
his positive outlook on life,
teaching us
along the way,

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:58.850
"You can't have 'no'
in your heart,"

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:02.854
and "Life's a garden.
Dig it."
Mr. Dirt is seen here meeting

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:06.108
one of his longtime idols,
Eddie Money.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.820
♪ Well, if I could
walk on water

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:14.699

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.430
Welcome back to TRL.

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:41.726
We are here with America's
sweetheart, Joe Dirt. Joe?
Joe, come back over here.

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:44.020
Joe!
We have a show to do here.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:46.208
People forget we're live.
You like the window,
don't you?

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:47.315
Yeah!

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.753
Joe, before we wrap this up,
is there anything else
you wanna say?

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:51.296
I just wanna say thanks
to all the people that

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.447
stop me in the street
and tell me my story
helped them somehow.

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:58.243
And your story is really cool.
It's like a Behind the Music
without the music.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:01.413
But are you depressed
I mean, your parents,
who you were looking for,

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:06.501
all along, were dead.
Was the last decade
a complete waste?

01:15:06.586 --> 01:15:09.671
Well, uh, no one's
really put it like that,
but I don't think so.

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:13.967
I've had some good times,
met some cool people, cruised
around, cranked some tunes.

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:16.697
What about Brandy
Is there any chance you guys
are gonna hook back up?

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:20.849
Um, well, you know,
she's a good friend of mine,
and she's off doin'

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:24.186
her own thing right now,
but I've always said
she's a little too hot

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.230
for old Joe Dirt.
I agree.
So does America.

01:15:27.315 --> 01:15:30.358
In fact, in our latest
"Is Brandy too hot
for Joe Dirt?" poll,

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:35.405
61 % of you agreed.
Even worse, 4% said the dog
was too hot for you.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:38.617
Dang.
I'm just kidding.
You're on TRL, California.

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:39.993
Hello, California.

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:43.413
Hey, wait... Am I...
Am I on? I'm on?

01:15:43.748 --> 01:15:48.793
Hey, baby, I'm on!
Yeah. Hey, Carson,
how big's your Johnny?

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:52.339
Joe, I think happy hour
started a little early
in California.

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:56.426
A little drinky-drinky.
The reason I'm really callin'
is Joe Dirt's parents

01:15:56.510 --> 01:16:01.556
ain't dead.
I'm lookin' at his father
right now, and I'm his mama.

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:05.477
Ma'am, you should never
drink the bong water.
Yeah, listen to him.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:09.147
Carson, just where you
wanna be when Jesus
comes back?

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:10.649
Makin' fun...
Sorry, Joe.

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:14.152
Wait, wait. Where's that
call comin' from?
California.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:15.862
Listen, I gotta go.

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:17.364
Oh, no, Joe!

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:19.449
So, Carson helped me
trace the call,

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:22.827
and it led me
to this old trailer park
in Simi Valley, California.

01:16:25.665 --> 01:16:28.750
Wow. Wow.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:34.881
That's our old car!

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:38.551
Right here, guys.
There he is.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:43.098
Joe, can I have an exclusive?

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.684
Your parents
are alive after all?

01:16:46.686 --> 01:16:48.853
Joe! Joe!
How are you feeling?

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:51.815
Mom, Dad, is that you?

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.568
Our baby's home.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:59.614
Damn. We tried
so hard to find him.
We looked high and low.

01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:02.867
I got some pictures here.
Look at this.
Here's a picture of Joe

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:05.954
when he was a baby.
Did you get it?
Yeah. Aw, baby.

01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:09.207
You were a cute baby,
Joe Dirt.
That's why we were so crazy

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:12.419
when we lost him.
I mean, he's here
and now he's gone.

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:15.922
Oh, mama,
it's all right.
Where'd he go? Aw.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:18.383
Did they get it?
Oh, where'd he go?

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:20.927
I was at the canyon, yeah.
You know what?

01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:24.389
It was right by
the garbage can
where you left me.

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:28.393
Wha...? Is that
where you were?
Well, I'll be dipped.

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:31.396
The one place
we didn't look.
I knew you looked for me.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.691
I told everybody you would.
And was there ever a time

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:37.527
when you would look
at the moon,
and was hopin' maybe

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:38.695
I was lookin' at it too?

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:39.904
Wouldn't you know

01:17:40.031 --> 01:17:42.991
that I've been doin'
this clown sort of thing?
Can everybody get a shot

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:46.036
of these? Do you see
these clown figurines?
Whenever I used to get sad,

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:51.291
I'd just look at a clown,
and then I just can't help it.
I just can't stop grinnin'.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.625
They're available for purchase.

01:17:52.752 --> 01:17:54.836
We're startin' this
Clown.com kind of a thing.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:55.920
Yeah.

01:17:56.047 --> 01:17:58.882
I don't mean to interrupt
your clown pitch there,

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:04.679
but how exactly do you not
go right back to the place
where you saw me?

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:11.519
Hey, how exactly
is a rainbow made?

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:13.438
How exactly does the sun set?

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.274
How exactly does
the Posi-Trac rear end
on a Plymouth work?

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:18.610
It just does.

01:18:18.778 --> 01:18:19.819
It just does.

01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:21.529
I'm not talkin' about Posi-Trac.

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:26.534
I'm talkin' about me.
How long did you look for me
before you gave up?

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:29.348
How long were you
ridin' in that car before
you realized I wasn't in it?

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:31.331
Exactly how long?

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:40.840
All right!
We didn't lose him.

01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:44.344
We just left him.
So what?
The dude's doin' fine!

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:45.637
Look at him!

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.921
How could you do that to me?
I was only eight years old.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:51.935
I was just a little kid.
Do you have any idea
what it's like to be a kid and

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:56.856
have nobody around to talk to?
No one that cares
if you're alive or dead?

01:18:57.817 --> 01:19:01.403
Every day you just think
you're worthless, and there's
a void in your life.

01:19:01.529 --> 01:19:04.489
Oh, come on, honey.
Lose that frown!
Lighten up, buddy.

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:07.700
When you're down,
stare at a clown.

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:10.620
Hey, sit down! You're
blockin' the cameras!
Move over.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:14.791
I don't care about that!
And I don't care
about you!

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:20.213
And I don't wanna see you
for another 25 years!
Joe, wait!

01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:23.591
I wish he'd never found us!
Look what he did
to my children!

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:24.884
Hey, TV people!

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:29.097
Hey, you're grounded!
Hey, TV people!
Why are y'all goin' away?

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:32.016
Come over here!
You don't have to follow him!

01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:39.774
What are you gonna do now, Joe?

01:19:51.412 --> 01:19:54.914
Somebody do something.

01:19:56.167 --> 01:20:01.671
- Joe, just turn around now.
- It's not worth it, Joe.

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:06.134
We are here at Wallace Bridge,

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:09.762
where local celebrity Joe Dirt
is threatening
to kill himself.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:13.349
Come on, Joe.
Remember what you said
on the show,

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:15.727
"Life's a garden.
Dig it?"

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:19.731
You gotta get down from there,
brother. You don't wanna
do this.

01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:23.985
Why not, man,
I got nothin'.
I've been lookin' forever

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:27.363
for those people, and everyone
lies to me, man.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:30.158
I'm worthless.

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:32.952
Joe!

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.330
Joe!

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:40.502
Hey, sorry, lady. You can't
cut through here.
Joe, it's me, Brandy!

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:42.837
Oh, it's Brandy?
Like, the Brandy?
Yes!

01:20:43.214 --> 01:20:45.423
Why didn't you say so.
Come on!

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:47.842
Hey, everybody, Brandy's here!
Hey, it's Brandy!

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:50.595
Come on, come on.

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:52.013
That's her!

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.015
Joe!

01:20:54.308 --> 01:20:55.433
Brandy?

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.018
I'm here, Joe.

01:20:57.436 --> 01:21:00.188
You told me my parents
were dead, and I saw 'em.

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:02.815
They're horrible.
Why did you lie to me?

01:21:03.108 --> 01:21:07.028
They saw you on the news
when you saved those kids.
They thought you got a reward.

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:10.532
So you did see 'em first.
So it's just like
Robby said.

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:14.536
Yes, but once I met them,
I knew I had to
protect you from them.

01:21:14.954 --> 01:21:18.498
They're bad people.
You're not
like them, Joe.

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:23.503
They didn't leave you.
You left them.
You've gotta see that.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.423
And, Joe, if you had
stayed with them,
you wouldn't have turned out

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:28.716
as wonderful as you are.

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:31.511
Robby said
you didn't want me around,

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:34.430
and he said that you was
always laughin' at me
behind my back.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.309
Why would Robby say
such a thing?
Of course that's not true.

01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:42.730
I love you, Joe,
with all my heart.

01:21:43.983 --> 01:21:48.570
I wanna get married, Joe,
and have little Joe Dirts.
Come home, Joe.

01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:52.824
You had a home all along.
You just couldn't see it.

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:55.994
You really love me?

01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:05.169
I did it! I did it!
I roped him
with a bungee cord.

01:22:10.301 --> 01:22:11.301
No!

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:13.595
Dang!

01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:15.888
Joe! Joe!

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:18.516
Ooh!

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:37.619
Oh, man. I just had
the weirdest dream.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.537
You were in it.

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:41.456
So were you.

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:47.086
Oh, my God.
Brandy, I'm home?

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.882
Clem, Charlene, Kickin' Wing.

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:52.550
It's not Clem anymore.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:54.427
It's Gert B. Frobe.

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:55.762
Wha?

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:58.033
Witness Protection relocated
me. I asked for Silvertown,

01:22:58.057 --> 01:23:01.100
on account of how you
talked about it.
It's wonderful here.

01:23:01.352 --> 01:23:03.144
Hello, Joe Dirt.

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:06.606
You taught me
to sell the good stuff.
Now I have

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:11.402
30 fireworks stands,
which completely fund
my animal shelters.

01:23:11.779 --> 01:23:13.112
It's all because of you, Joe.

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:14.864
Good job, brother.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:18.910
I sold the gator farm, after
one of those bastards snapped
off my thumb

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:22.413
and middle finger. I came up
here to check up on you,
and, well,

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:24.832
I met Gert B. Frobe.

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:28.313
And it's a good thing
that gator didn't get
my ring finger,

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:30.129
because Gert's asked me
to marry him.

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:31.214
Yeah.

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:33.883
Right on.
Joe.

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:37.595
When you were in the hospital
for your head injury,
I had the doctor

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.224
surgically put on a wig
that's a little more
contemporary.

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:56.197
Ooh! Dang!
That's cool.

01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:59.826
And Joe, we have a big
surprise for you.

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:00.910
What's up?

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:07.125
My Hemi! You got it
outta hock for me? Dang! Yeah!

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.502
Somebody else wants
to get in here.

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:10.628
Who's that?

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:14.757
Come on, boy! Come on!
Wow! Looks like
Charlie!

01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:18.177
Yep. Apparently,
back in the day,
Charlie had a little sexual

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:20.513
encounter with this one's ma.

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:22.724
Say hello to Charlie Two.

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:25.893
Good boy.
You got a big family now,
Joe Dirt.

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:27.979
You better be good to us.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:29.188
Oh, I will.

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:40.616
Hey, Dirt!
I thought I told you, buddy,
nobody wants you around!

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:44.412
Hey! You're talkin'
to my guy all wrong.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:48.833
It's the wrong tone. Do it
again, I'll stab you in the
face with a soldering iron.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:50.585
You're his dad?

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:54.964
What if I am?
What if we're his family?

01:24:57.342 --> 01:24:58.342
Okay.

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:02.013
At least I know my car
will blow his off the road!

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:05.850
You actually think you can
match that little Slant Six
of yours against his 426 Hemi?

01:25:06.185 --> 01:25:07.185
Huh?

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.896
Then let's do it, little boy.

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.898
Whoo!
That's my girl.

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:13.357
Let's rock, Dirtboy.

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:14.901
Let's go!

01:25:20.783 --> 01:25:21.866
Damn.

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:36.839
Now, it's time
for the good stuff!
Whoo!

01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:39.884
Yeah!
Light her up!

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:44.430
This next song
goes out to our good friend,
Joe Dirt, the dirt man.

01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:48.559
Joe, wherever you are,
this is for you, buddy.
Welcome home, Joe.

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:50.353
