WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.699
PREVIOUSLY ON
"CRIMINAL MINDS"...

00:03.742 --> 00:05.788
PHILIP "THE BRICK" BROOKS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

00:05.831 --> 00:08.573
I MAY HAVE ESCAPED
WITH MY LIFE,
THANKS TO YOU,

00:08.617 --> 00:09.922
BUT AFTER TWO YEARS
OF PT,

00:09.966 --> 00:12.142
ALL I GOT TO SHOW FOR IT
IS A FEW TENTATIVE STEPS.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.970
I WENT TO VISIT
MY OLD PARTNER THIS MORNING.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.928
HIS DOCTORS THOUGHT
HE'D BE PARALYZED PERMANENTLY

00:15.972 --> 00:17.582
FROM THE WAIST DOWN.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.584
I'M JUST WISHING
THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO TO HELP.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.804
THIS IS LOU.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.762
HI, LOU. OHH.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.895
I THINK LOU'S
GONNA BE MY BUDDY.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.072
THANK YOU, BROTHER.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.205
ALVEZ: I MET
THIS GIRL, LISA.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.858
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HER.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.731
I NEVER DO THIS,
BLIND DATES.

00:35.774 --> 00:36.732
ME, NEITHER.

00:36.775 --> 00:37.907
BUT PHIL INSISTED
THAT WE MEET,

00:37.950 --> 00:39.256
AND HE WOULD--

00:39.300 --> 00:40.866
WOULDN'T TAKE "NO"
FOR AN ANSWER.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.923
I'M GLAD YOU
CAME OVER, MAN.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.098
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.317
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
CALLED EARLIER.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.666
I WOULD HAVE HELPED
YOU OUT WITH THE MOVE.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.711
OH, MOST OF LISA'S STUFF
WAS HERE ALREADY.

00:59.755 --> 01:00.930
IT WAS JUST LAST
COUPLE OF THINGS.

01:00.973 --> 01:03.324
HMM.
CLASSIC LUKE ALVEZ,

01:03.367 --> 01:04.847
WILLING TO GO
AT IT ALONE.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.109
OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HIM WRESTLE

01:06.153 --> 01:07.676
THE BED FRAME
AT MY APARTMENT.

01:07.719 --> 01:09.852
HE KEPT SAYING,
"DON'T WORRY, LISA.
JUST STAND BACK.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.854
I GOT THIS.""I GOT THIS."

01:11.897 --> 01:14.291
YOU TWO ARE THE WORST.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.424
OK, THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
I DIDN'T INVITE YOU TO HELP.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.121
LISA:
PHIL, WE OWE YOU.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.167
WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE
IF YOU DIDN'T INTRODUCE US.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.777
LET'S CALL IT
EVEN THEN,

01:21.820 --> 01:22.995
'CAUSE WITHOUT
THE TWO OF YOU,

01:23.039 --> 01:24.345
I'D NEVER MEET LOU.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.260
THAT LITTLE GUY,
HE SAVED ME.

01:26.303 --> 01:29.959
WITHOUT HIM, I WOULDN'T
BE ON MY FEET
AND BACK TO WORK.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.134
HOW'S THE NEW JOB?

01:31.178 --> 01:33.005
I'M STILL THANKFUL
TO BE BACK AT THE FBI.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.833
I MEAN, EVEN IF IT IS
BEHIND A DESK.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.400
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

01:36.444 --> 01:38.359
SINCE YOU MOVED OVER
TO THE E.R.
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:38.402 --> 01:40.578
HMM, LEAVING THE REHAB
WING WAS TOUGH,

01:40.622 --> 01:42.537
BUT I LOVE
THE NEW CHALLENGE.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.799
PHIL: THAT'S GREAT.

01:45.017 --> 01:48.760
AND NOW WE TURN TO
THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR,

01:48.804 --> 01:50.284
LUKE ALVEZ.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.416
WHAT'S UP WITH
THE BAU, LUKE?

01:54.766 --> 01:56.551
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.078
WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY
MORE THAN I EXPECTED.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.036
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

02:04.080 --> 02:06.169
WELL, SOME DETAILS, MAN,
ABOUT A CASE OR TWO.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.476
WHAT'S NEW WITH PENELOPE?

02:08.519 --> 02:10.260
IS SHE SEEING ANYBODY?
WHAT'S UP?

02:10.304 --> 02:13.437
COME ON, BRO.
HOW MANY TIMES DO
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

02:13.481 --> 02:16.266
YOU ARE NO MATCH
FOR PENELOPE GARCIA.

02:16.310 --> 02:20.618
I'M SMART.
I'M CONSIDERATE
AND STABLE.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.142
MM-HMM.
DON'T FORGET EMPLOYED.

02:22.185 --> 02:25.623
EMPLOYED. MAN, I'M
LIKE THE TOTAL PACKAGE, MAN.
COME ON.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.017
I DON'T KNOW, OK.
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
SHE'S LOOKING.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.411
I'VE BEEN BUSY AT WORK.

02:30.454 --> 02:33.979
OH. ANYTHING
INTERESTING?

02:36.895 --> 02:40.116
COME ON, MAN.
I'M GETTING
FROSTBITE OUT HERE.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.336
HE DOES THE SAME THING
TO ME WHEN I ASK
ABOUT THE CASES.

02:42.379 --> 02:43.815
I CAN'T EVEN GET
A MIDDLE OF THE DAY

02:43.859 --> 02:45.513
"HOW'S IT GOING?"
TEXT FROM THE GUY.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.561
THE TWO OF YOU.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.216
I GOT A NEW CASE.
I'VE GOT TO RUN.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.740
SORRY.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.187
LATER.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.666
MMM. MMM.SEE YOU LATER.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.929
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
GIVE MY BEST TO PENELOPE.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.630
MORNING, GARCIA.MMM!

03:15.673 --> 03:17.501
HOW DARE YOU
BURY THE LEDE?

03:17.545 --> 03:20.025
HOW DID THE BIG
MOVE

03:20.069 --> 03:20.983
IT WAS GREAT.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.506
SO LISA'S ALL MOVED IN?

03:22.550 --> 03:23.464
SHE IS.

03:23.507 --> 03:24.987
DETAILS.
LUKE, GIVE ME DETAILS

03:25.030 --> 03:26.510
OR I'M GONNA GET
GRUMPY WITH YOU
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

03:26.554 --> 03:29.948
WE PACKED UP
THE LAST FEW THINGS

03:29.992 --> 03:30.949
IN LISA'S OLD APARTMENT,

03:30.993 --> 03:33.387
SHE HANDED IN THE KEYS,
CAME HOME,

03:33.430 --> 03:36.216
UNPACKED A FEW MORE BOXES.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.130
OH, THEN LOU AND PHIL
CAME OVER.

03:38.174 --> 03:40.611
LOU! HOW IS MY SWEET,
SWEET LOU?

03:40.655 --> 03:42.265
HIGH ENERGY.

03:42.309 --> 03:45.050
YEAH, I MEAN, HE REALLY
WEARS ROXY OUT.

03:45.094 --> 03:47.444
SHE SLEEPS FOR LIKE
TWO DAYS STRAIGHT
AFTER HE VISITS.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.098
PLAYING WITH A PUPPY
AND THEN A NAP,

03:49.141 --> 03:50.491
THAT IS LIKE HEAVEN.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.101
IT'S PRETTY GOOD, YEAH.

03:52.144 --> 03:55.235
OH, LISA SAYS THANKS
FOR THE WALL-HANGING
THAT YOU MADE US.

03:55.278 --> 03:58.107
SHE LIKES IT?SHE LOVES IT.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.630
FANTASTIC.
I REALLY THINK

03:59.674 --> 04:01.502
IT'S GONNA BRING
THE WHOLE LIVING ROOM
TOGETHER

04:01.545 --> 04:02.981
BECAUSE IT'S
LIKE POWERFUL

04:03.025 --> 04:05.027
WITHOUT BEING
OVERPOWERING,
YOU KNOW.

04:05.070 --> 04:08.117
I AGREE. YEAH.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.988
WHAT ABOUT PHIL?

04:10.032 --> 04:11.555
DID HE ASK ABOUT ME?

04:12.904 --> 04:14.384
NO.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.302
YOU READY TO FIGHT CRIME?

04:19.346 --> 04:21.086
OH, BORN READY.
BRING IT.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.047
GARCIA: 3 VICTIMS
IN 3 DAYS--

04:25.090 --> 04:27.789
RICK SALAZAR,
MICHAEL WILLIAMS,
AND JOHN REYNOSO.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.181
EACH WAS SHOT IN
THE BACK OF THE HEAD

04:29.225 --> 04:30.444
WITH A .40-CALIBER
PISTOL.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.054
THEY LIVED IN DIFFERENT
STATES RUNNING SOUTH

04:32.097 --> 04:33.577
ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD.

04:33.621 --> 04:36.232
JOHN, THE MOST RECENT,
WAS IN NEARBY
BETHESDA, MARYLAND.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.061
EXECUTION STYLE.
COULD BE PROFESSIONAL.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.063
REID: YOU KNOW,
MOST ASSASSINATIONS
ARE ONE AND DONES.

04:41.106 --> 04:43.065
HIT MEN ACQUIRE A TARGET,
EXECUTE THEM,
AND THEN DISAPPEAR.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.110
KILLING MULTIPLE
VICTIMS WITHOUT
CHANGING HIS M.O.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.634
EXPOSES HIM AND
MAKES HIM TRACKABLE.

04:46.677 --> 04:49.201
JJ: THE VICTIMS
WERE SEEMINGLY-AVERAGE
PEOPLE

04:49.245 --> 04:51.378
WITH NORMAL
MIDDLE-CLASS LIVES.

04:51.421 --> 04:54.163
NOTHING HERE SAYS THEY
WOULD BE TARGETED BY A HIT MAN.

04:54.206 --> 04:57.427
YEAH, KILLING RANDOM
PEOPLE'S JUST NOT
WHAT A HIT MAN DOES.

04:57.471 --> 05:00.561
IF THEY'RE MOVING THIS FAST,
THEY MUST BE WORKING OFF A LIST.

05:00.604 --> 05:03.390
WHAT IF ALL 3 VICTIMS
ARE KEY WITNESSES
TO A FEDERAL CRIME?

05:03.433 --> 05:05.000
THAT WOULD PUT THEM
ON A LIST.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.349
AS WOULD
WITNESS PROTECTION.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.612
GARCIA, START RUNNING
THROUGH THE WITSEC DATABASE.

05:08.656 --> 05:11.049
I'LL REACH OUT TO THEM
AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE,

05:11.093 --> 05:12.834
SEE IF THERE'S
ANY OVERLAP.
GOT IT.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.358
REID: WE SHOULD ALS
CONSIDER THAT OUR UNSUB
MIGHT NOT BE A HIT MAN,

05:15.402 --> 05:16.968
THAT HE'S OPERATING
OFF A LIST OF VICTIMS

05:17.012 --> 05:18.579
BASED ON THEIR
PERCEIVED TRANSGRESSIONS.

05:18.622 --> 05:19.971
A MORAL ENFORCER.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.103
WELL, EITHER WAY,
WE NEED TO ASSUME

05:21.146 --> 05:22.452
THERE ARE OTHER TARGETS.

05:22.496 --> 05:23.801
WE'LL RUN THE CASE
OUT OF HERE

05:23.845 --> 05:25.281
UNTIL WE CAN PREDICT
HIS NEXT MOVE.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.457
BUT BASED ON HIS SPEED,
WE WILL HAVE TO WORK FAST.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.720
NO.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.766
NO, PLEASE.

05:33.855 --> 05:34.899
I KNOW YOU WON'T
LET ME GO,

05:34.943 --> 05:36.379
SO JUST GET IT OVER QUICK.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.076
PLEASE, THAT'S ALL
I'M ASKING FOR.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.469
AHH! STOP!

06:10.805 --> 06:14.199
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.817
ALVEZ: "I'M A FIGHTER.

06:22.860 --> 06:25.863
I BELIEVE IN THE
EYE-FOR-AN-EYE BUSINESS."

06:25.907 --> 06:27.299
MUHAMMAD ALI.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.780
GARCIA: GUYS.
BAD NEWS.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.260
A FOURTH VICTIM
ALREADY?

06:31.303 --> 06:34.306
PAUL McENTEE,
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA,
JUST SOUTH OF HERE.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.699
HE'S AN ACCOUNTANT,
LIVED ALONE.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.092
I SENT ALL THE FILES
TO YOUR TABLETS AND PHONES.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.007
ANY LUCK WITH WITSEC?

06:39.050 --> 06:40.530
NOT YET.
AND I'VE BEEN SCOURING

06:40.574 --> 06:42.271
ANY PERTINENT FBI DATABASES.
NOTHING THERE, EITHER.

06:42.314 --> 06:44.186
TWO KILLS IN LESS
THAN A DAY.
HE'S SPEEDING UP.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.754
WELL, IF OUR UNSUB'S
A HIT MAN, HE'S MOVING
FAST TO AVOID DETECTION.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.320
HE MIGHT BE NEAR
THE END OF HIS LIST.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.018
REID: I'M STILL NOT
CONVINCED HE IS A HIT MAN.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.454
IF HE'S A VIGILANTE
OR MORAL ENFORCER,

06:51.498 --> 06:52.847
THE SHORTENING
COOLING DOWN PERIOD

06:52.890 --> 06:54.283
COULD BE A SIGN
HE'S LOSING CONTROL.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.241
SPENCE, YOU, DAVE,
AND TARA GO TO BETHESDA.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.026
LUKE AND I WILL HEAD
TO THE M.E.'s OFFICE,

06:58.069 --> 06:59.549
TAKE A LOOK AT
THE LATEST VICTIM.

06:59.593 --> 07:02.030
I'LL HAVE MATT AND JJ
GO TO ARLINGTON.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.949
SIMMONS: THEY TOLD US
TO GO TO THE BEDROOM.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.821
THAT'S WEIRD.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.913
IT'S YOURS.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.742
NO, THAT'S WEIRD.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.712
PAUL McENTEE HAS
A PANIC ROOM.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.975
WHY WOULD AN ACCOUNTANT

07:34.018 --> 07:36.368
WITH NO FAMILY
NEED A PANIC ROOM?

07:36.412 --> 07:39.023
WELL, IF HE WAS
A WITNESS IN A KEY CASE

07:39.067 --> 07:41.722
OR IN WITSEC,
HE'D PROBABLY WANT
TO FEEL PROTECTED.

07:41.765 --> 07:44.289
YEAH. WITSEC WOULDN'T
PAY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

07:44.333 --> 07:47.858
AND HE COULDN'T AFFORD
THIS ON HIS SALARY.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.947
PAUL MUST HAVE HAD
A SECOND INCOME,

07:49.991 --> 07:52.080
LIKELY DISCREET
AND PAID IN CASH

07:52.123 --> 07:53.516
TO KEEP HIM OFF
ANY RADARS.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.388
WELL, WE NEED TO FOLLOW
THAT MONEY TRAIL.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.173
IT COULD HELP US
PIECE TOGETHER

07:58.216 --> 08:00.305
THE VICTIMOLOGY
CONNECTION WE'VE
BEEN MISSING.

08:00.349 --> 08:03.265
JJ, JUST LOOK AROUND.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.049
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

08:06.224 --> 08:09.140
WELL, EXCEPT FOR
THAT BLOOD SPATTER,

08:09.184 --> 08:11.360
I'D HAVE NO IDEA A CRIME
WAS COMMITTED HERE.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.709
EXACTLY.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.190
HEH. YEAH, THIS GUY'S
NOT LOSING CONTROL.

08:15.233 --> 08:18.193
HE'S COLD, CALCULATED.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.804
HE'S SIMPLY DOING A JOB.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.154
HE'S NOT TRYING TO TEACH
ANYBODY A LESSON HERE.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.941
IT FEELS LIKE WE CAN
TAKE MORAL ENFORCER
OFF THE TABLE.

08:26.984 --> 08:30.553
C.O.D. ON PAUL McENTEE
WAS TWO SUCCESSIVE
GUNSHOT WOUNDS

08:30.597 --> 08:32.163
TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD
AT CLOSE RANGE

08:32.207 --> 08:34.905
WITH A .40-CALIBER PISTOL.
SAME AS THE FIRST THREE.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.603
SO HE CONTROLLED THEM
WITH THE GUN.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.126
DID HE TORTURE THEM
AT ALL?

08:38.169 --> 08:40.041
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF HEMATOMA ANYWHERE
ON HIS BODY,

08:40.084 --> 08:42.391
BUT THERE IS PRE-MORTEM
BRUISING TO HIS WRISTS.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.698
IF HE'S A PROFESSIONAL,
WHY GO THROUGH ALL THE TROUBLE

08:44.741 --> 08:47.004
OF TYING HIM UP JUST TO
KILL HIM IN THERE?

08:47.048 --> 08:48.310
MAYBE HE WANTED
TO MUFFLE THE SOUND?

08:48.353 --> 08:50.573
.40 CAL'S A BIG GUN
WITH A BIG BANG.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.096
I ALSO FOUND
SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE

08:52.140 --> 08:54.055
IN HIS MOUTH, THROAT,
AND STOMACH.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.361
SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE?
THAT'S HOUSEHOLD BLEACH,
ISN'T IT?

08:56.405 --> 08:58.015
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE MADE HIM DRINK

08:58.059 --> 08:59.321
AN ENTIRE
BOTTLE'S WORTH.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.976
SO HE COULD HAVE LET HIM
DIE FROM THE POISONING,

09:02.019 --> 09:03.499
BUT HE CHOSE NOT TO.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.022
THAT'S A PRETTY
CLEAR MESSAGE.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.155
YOU'RE A RAT, SO I'M
GONNA SILENCE YOU FIRST

09:07.198 --> 09:09.200
BY BURNING YOUR
MOUTH AND THROAT,

09:09.244 --> 09:10.462
AND THEN I'LL KILL YOU.

09:10.506 --> 09:13.161
HE DID THIS TO ALL
OF THEM, DIDN'T HE?

09:13.204 --> 09:14.684
HE DID.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.251
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BEFORE?

09:16.294 --> 09:18.819
YEAH, I HAVE.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.995
IN MEXICO.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.521
ALVEZ:
THIS IS EDUARDO RAMOS.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.176
HE'S THE MOST FEARED
SICARIO IN MEXICO.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.699
A SICARIO'S A HIT MAN, YEAH?

09:29.743 --> 09:32.223
SPECIFICALLY HIT MEN
THAT WORK FOR MEXICAN
DRUG CARTELS.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.225
HE'S WITH
THE MARTINEZ CARTEL.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.705
THEY'RE ONE OF THE
MOST DANGEROUS AROUND.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.098
WELL, LOOK, THE M.O.
OF THESE GUYS IS
TYPICALLY BRUTAL.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.621
WHAT MAKES RAMOS
MOST FEARED?

09:38.665 --> 09:40.492
HIS UNRELENTING FOCUS

09:40.536 --> 09:42.320
AND COMPLETE LACK
OF BOUNDARIES.

09:42.364 --> 09:43.974
HE'S GOT NO MORAL CODE.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.715
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE
HIS TARGET,

09:45.759 --> 09:47.238
HE DOESN'T STOP
UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.764
IF THAT MEANS GOING THROUGH
EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD,

09:50.807 --> 09:53.201
HE DOES.
NO HESITATION.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.637
SOMEONE ELSE, YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO BUY YOUR WAY

09:54.681 --> 09:56.987
OUT OF IT, NOT RAMOS.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.250
THERE'S NO BRIBING HIM.
THERE'S NO APPEALING
TO HIS SENSES.

09:59.294 --> 10:03.167
EDUARDO RAMOS IS
A KILLING MACHINE
THAT NEVER FAILS.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.778
SO HOW DID YOU MEET HIM?

10:04.821 --> 10:07.911
5 YEARS AGO I WAS WORKING
A CASE WITH THE DEA

10:07.955 --> 10:09.478
AND MEXICAN POLICE FORCE.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.611
OUR GOAL WAS TO
ARREST RAMOS.

10:11.654 --> 10:12.655
AND DID YOU?

10:12.699 --> 10:15.136
IT GOT COMPLICATED.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.154
ALVEZ: RAMOS SHOULD BE
CROSSING THE STREET

10:33.197 --> 10:34.459
HEADING TOWARDS US
ANY SECOND.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.940
GRANT, YOU IN PLACE?

10:36.984 --> 10:38.725
AFFIRMATIVE.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.945
A SNIPER. PULLING
ALL THE STOPS.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.513
FOR PROTECTION.
IT'S JUST IN CASE.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.123
OK.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.952
YOU DON'T GET THAT
MANY SHOTS TO A GUY
LIKE RAMOS.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.954
HEY, MANNY, OUR JOB
IS TO ARREST HIM.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.174
THE CARTEL OWNS MOST
OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

10:53.217 --> 10:56.133
HE'LL BE OUT IN 3 DAYS.
THIS IS OUR CHANCE.

10:56.177 --> 10:58.135
COME ON, WE AREN'T
MERCENARIES.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.224
AND HE'S NOT HUMAN.

11:00.268 --> 11:01.573
HE MURDERED OVER 50 PEOPLE,

11:01.617 --> 11:03.140
AND THAT'S THE ONES
THAT WE KNOW ABOUT.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.621
MEN, WOMEN, CHILDREN,
INNOCENT.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.492
EDUARDO RAMOS
DESERVES TO DIE.

11:07.536 --> 11:08.755
NO.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.887
HIS VICTIMS DESERVE JUSTICE.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.106
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
GONNA GET.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.369
PHIL:
HEY, THERE'S RAMOS.

11:14.412 --> 11:15.849
MAKE THE ARREST,
LUKE.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.633
WE'RE NOT ABOVE
THE LAW.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.330
OK. GO, GO, GO.

11:19.374 --> 11:20.331
WHAT THE HELL?

11:20.375 --> 11:22.159
MANNY: AMBUSH!HE'S RUNNING.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.465
GET DOWN!

11:27.948 --> 11:29.340
I'M GOING AFTER RAMOS!

11:29.384 --> 11:31.778
MAN: COPY.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.346
UHH!

11:43.877 --> 11:46.140
GRANT: ALVEZ.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.750
I HAVE A CLEAN SHOT.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.186
NO! DON'T TAKE THE SHOT.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.535
DON'T TAKE THE SHOT!

11:50.579 --> 11:52.276
ARE YOU SURE?

11:52.320 --> 11:54.670
ALVEZ, ARE YOU SURE?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.324
YES.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.934
I GOT HIM.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.957
ALVEZ: INSPECTOR
SILVA WAS WRONG.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.785
RAMOS STAYED IN PRISON
FOR 3 YEARS,

12:22.829 --> 12:24.395
AND THEN HE BROKE OUT
AND VANISHED.

12:24.439 --> 12:27.094
NOW, BOTH THE DEA
AND THE FBI BELIEVED
HE'D COME BACK

12:27.137 --> 12:29.052
TO GET HIS REVENGE
ON THE MARTINEZ CARTEL

12:29.096 --> 12:31.315
BECAUSE SOMEONE
INSIDE THE CARTEL,

12:31.359 --> 12:32.752
AND WE NEVER FOUND OUT WHO,

12:32.795 --> 12:34.884
GAVE US THE INITIAL TIP
THAT LED TO HIS ARREST.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.234
SO THE TRAIL THAT LED
TO PAUL McENTEE'S
PANIC ROOM

12:37.278 --> 12:38.888
MAY HAVE STARTED WITH
THE MARTINEZ CARTEL,

12:38.932 --> 12:41.717
AND IF THAT'S TRUE,
IT LIKELY INVOLVED DRUGS.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.198
YEAH. GARCIA, WE NEED YOU
TO GO THROUGH THE DEA DATABASE

12:44.241 --> 12:46.461
AND FIND OUT IF ANY
OF OUR VICTIMS ARE
CONNECTED TO THE CARTEL.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.942
COPY THAT.I ALSO GOT THE GREEN LIGHT
FROM PRENTISS

12:48.985 --> 12:50.291
TO BRING IN MY BUDDY PHIL.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.683
HE'S GOT A LOT OF
CONTACTS IN THE DEA.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.250
MAYBE HE CAN HELP.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.258
WHAT THE HELL?

13:01.302 --> 13:05.045
I DON'T KNOW
THE OTHERS,
BUT THIS GUY,

13:05.088 --> 13:07.699
PAUL McENTEE,
I RECOGNIZE HIM.

13:07.743 --> 13:10.354
HE WAS A MIDDLEMAN
FOR THE MARTINEZ CARTEL.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.617
HE GREASED THE WHEELS
THAT BROUGHT THE PRODUCT
INTO THE COUNTRY.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.229
JJ: YOU THINK HE'S
THE C.I. WHO
GAVE UP RAMOS?

13:15.272 --> 13:17.274
WE NEVER KNEW THE
IDENTITY OF THE C.I.,

13:17.318 --> 13:18.406
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.756
IF THIS IS AN ACT
OF REVENGE FOR RAMOS,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.323
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.412
ANYBODY ASSOCIATED
WITH THE CARTEL'S
GUILTY IN HIS EYES.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.893
ALL RIGHT, NOT ONLY
BECAUSE THEY RATTED HIM OUT,

13:26.936 --> 13:28.851
THEY ALSO ABANDONED HIM
IN PRISON.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.505
SO HE'S GONNA KILL
EVERYONE INVOLVED,

13:30.548 --> 13:33.377
NO MATTER HOW FAR REMOVED
FROM HIS ARREST IN MEXICO.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.076
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LET
PENELOPE KNOW WHAT WE FOUND.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.947
TELL HER I SAID HI.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.474
IT'S MANNY.

13:43.518 --> 13:44.998
I REACHED OUT TO HIM.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.960
MANNY: PHIL BROOKS.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.577
WE THINK EDUARDO RAMOS
IS BACK,

13:59.621 --> 14:01.231
BUT HE'S IN THE STATES.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.407
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

14:03.451 --> 14:04.626
IT MIGHT SOUND
IMPOSSIBLE,

14:04.669 --> 14:06.410
BUT WE'VE GOT
4 BODIES THAT SAY SO.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.325
NO, I MEAN THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE

14:08.369 --> 14:10.327
BECAUSE EDUARDO RAMOS
IS DEAD.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.242
DEAD?
YEAH.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.592
HE STAYED OFF THE RADAR
AFTER HE GOT OUT OF PRISON.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.420
WE FIGURED HE WAS
LAYING LOW.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.292
BUT THEN I GOT A CALL
THAT EDUARDO RAMOS

14:18.335 --> 14:19.902
WAS GUNNED DOWN IN SINALOA.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.904
TWO SHOTS BEHIND THE HEAD.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.080
AND LISTEN TO THIS,

14:24.124 --> 14:25.865
HE HAD BLEACH
IN HIS STOMACH.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.388
WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS?

14:27.431 --> 14:30.521
A FEW WEEKS AGO.
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO PIN DOWN.

14:30.565 --> 14:34.264
THE VERY REPUTATION
OF THE SICARIOS ARE
THAT THEY'RE GHOSTS.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.746
BUT A FRIEND OF MINE
CONFIRMED IT IN SINALOA,

14:37.789 --> 14:40.270
AND I SAW THE BODY MYSELF
TWO DAYS AGO.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.620
SINALOA ISN'T EVEN
PART OF MARTINEZ
CARTEL TERRITORY.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.144
WHY WAS RAMOS THERE?

14:44.187 --> 14:45.493
HARD TO SAY.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.669
HE COULD HAVE BEEN
HIDING OUT OR WORKING.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.366
WHO DO YOU THINK
DID THIS?

14:49.410 --> 14:50.890
PLENTY OF PEOPLE
HAVE MOTIVE--

14:50.933 --> 14:54.502
A RIVAL CARTEL,
HIS OWN CARTEL,

14:54.545 --> 14:57.461
HELL, VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.724
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, MANNY.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.727
SOMEONE'S POSING
AS EDUARDO RAMOS.

15:02.771 --> 15:05.078
YEAH, BUT WHO
WOULD DO THAT?

15:05.121 --> 15:08.472
WHOEVER IT IS KILLED
THE MOST FEARED
SICARIO IN MEXICO

15:08.516 --> 15:10.561
USING HIS OWN M.O.
AGAINST HIM,

15:10.605 --> 15:13.216
THEN DID IT 4 MORE TIMES
WITHOUT US KNOWING
THE DIFFERENCE.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.566
THIS GUY'S MORE DANGEROUS
THAN WE THOUGHT.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.481
MAN: HAIL MARY,
FULL OF GRACE,

15:17.525 --> 15:20.397
THE LORD IS WITH THEE.

15:20.441 --> 15:23.183
BLESSED ARE THOU
AMONGST WOMEN

15:23.226 --> 15:25.750
AND BLESSED IS THE FRUIT
OF THY WOMB JESUS.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.622
MAN: KEEP GOING.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.711
I CAN'T. IT BURNS.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.669
FINISH IT.

15:31.713 --> 15:34.759
HOLY MARY,
MOTHER OF GOD,

15:34.803 --> 15:36.936
PRAY FOR US SINNERS

15:36.979 --> 15:40.243
NOW AND AT THE HOUR
OF OUR DEATHS.

15:41.592 --> 15:42.593
AMEN.

15:55.563 --> 15:56.999
ALVEZ: HEY, IT'S ME.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.087
IS EVERYTHING OK?

15:58.131 --> 16:00.785
YEAH. WHAT, A GUY CAN'T
CALL HIS WOMAN

16:00.829 --> 16:03.092
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
JUST TO SAY, "HOW'S IT GOING?"

16:03.136 --> 16:07.575
AW. LUKE ALVEZ,
YOU LISTENED.

16:07.618 --> 16:11.144
TECHNICALLY, NO.
I CALLED. I DIDN'T TEXT.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.494
AND YOUR ONE-UPS-MANSHIP
WILL BE JUSTLY REWARDED

16:13.537 --> 16:16.149
UPON YOUR TRIUMPHANT
RETURN HOME,

16:16.192 --> 16:18.238
WHICH HOPEFULLY IS SOON.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.804
I HOPE SO.

16:19.848 --> 16:23.808
HOW ABOUT I PICK UP
A BOTTLE OF YOUR
FAVORITE WINE

16:23.852 --> 16:26.855
ON MY WAY BACK
AND YOU ORDER THAI

16:26.898 --> 16:28.596
FROM THAT LATE-NIGHT
PLACE DOWN THE STREET

16:28.639 --> 16:31.425
AND WE GET UNDER
THE COVERS AND WATCH

16:31.468 --> 16:33.601
THE NEW SEASON OF OUR
FAVORITE SHOW TILL SUNRISE?

16:33.644 --> 16:36.430
HOW ABOUT WE DO
SOMETHING ELSE
UNTIL SUNRISE?

16:38.084 --> 16:40.434
YEAH, I GOT TO CALL
TO CHECK IN MORE OFTEN.

16:40.477 --> 16:43.176
UNFORTUNATELY, IT CAN'T
ALWAYS BE THAI FOOD AND SEX.

16:44.438 --> 16:47.832
SO, GARCIA'S
WALL-HANGING...

16:47.876 --> 16:51.010
YEAH, I, UM, I KNOW.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.794
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO HANG IT?

16:52.837 --> 16:54.274
THERE'S A NICE BIG SPACE
OVER THE RECORD PLAYER.

16:54.317 --> 16:55.753
IT SHOULD GO THERE.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.017
WAIT,
YOU LIKE IT.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.453
I LOVE IT.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.671
OH, THAT'S--

17:00.715 --> 17:01.933
ROSSI: THERE'S BEEN
ANOTHER MURDER.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.761
THIS TIME IN SPRINGFIELD,
SOUTH OF ARLINGTON.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.067
REID'S ALREADY THERE.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.460
OK.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.723
HEY, IT'S WORK.
THEY NEED ME. I GOTTA GO.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.072
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
OK.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.161
STAY SAFE. LOVE YOU.

17:12.205 --> 17:13.989
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.473
SIMMONS: WHAT DID
YOU FIND, SPENCE?

17:19.516 --> 17:21.127
VICTIM'S NAME IS
MIKE EVERSON.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.911
HE OWNS AN AUTO SHOP
AND LIVED ALONE.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.565
THE DEA SAYS HE'S
A KNOWN DRUG TRAFFICKER

17:24.608 --> 17:26.001
FOR THE MARTINEZ
CARTEL,

17:26.045 --> 17:27.568
SO EVEN THOUGH RAMOS
ISN'T OUR GUY,

17:27.611 --> 17:29.048
IT APPEARS AS THOUGH
THE UNSUB IS STILL

17:29.091 --> 17:31.224
PUNISHING HIS VICTIMS
FOR THEIR CARTEL TIES.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.661
ANY SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE?
DID MIKE FIGHT BACK?

17:33.704 --> 17:35.967
HE DID, AND DURING
THE FIGHT, THIS HAPPENED.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.969
THIS PART RIGHT HERE
ISN'T BLOOD.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.233
IT'S A MIXTURE OF
CHEWING TOBACCO
AND SALIVA.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.886
WHAT'S WEIRD IS
THE UNSUB USED BLEACH

17:41.930 --> 17:43.975
TO TRY TO CLEAN IT UP,
BUT HE LEFT BEHIND
SOME RESIDUE.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.152
I'M HAVING IT RUN THROUGH
ALL THE APPROPRIATE
CRIMINAL DATABASES.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.545
I MEAN, HOPEFULLY
THERE'S A HIT.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.286
SON OF A...

17:55.944 --> 17:58.294
WHAT?WE NEED THE WHOLE TEAM.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.557
I KNOW WHO DID THIS.

18:00.601 --> 18:03.604
SO DNA FROM THE LATEST
CRIME SCENE CONFIRMS

18:03.647 --> 18:05.475
THAT OUR UNSUB
IS JEREMY GRANT.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.912
HE WAS A DEA SNIPER
PHIL AND I WORKED WITH
IN MEXICO

18:07.956 --> 18:09.914
WHEN WE WERE HUNTING
EDUARDO RAMOS.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.960
WE WEREN'T TIGHT,
BUT WE KNEW HIM A BIT.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.615
HE TOOK ORDERS WELL.
HE WAS GOOD AT HIS JOB.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.138
I LOST TOUCH WITH HIM
AFTER MEXICO.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.574
YEAH, SO DID I.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.228
SIMMONS: THAT'S NOT
UNCOMMON AFTER A MISSION.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.838
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

18:20.882 --> 18:22.275
JEREMY GRANT STILL
WORKS FOR THE DEA.

18:22.318 --> 18:25.060
HE LIVES IN MEXICO
WITH HIS WIFE
AND TWO DAUGHTERS.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.497
WOW, HE WAS PRACTICALLY
RAMOS' NEIGHBOR.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.109
UH, HE'S LIVED IN MEXICO
FOR OVER 10 YEARS.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.676
BOTH OF HIS DAUGHTERS
WERE BORN THERE.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.593
HE WAS JUST PUT ON
MANDATORY BEREAVEMENT
FOR...

18:36.637 --> 18:38.508
OH, MY.

18:38.552 --> 18:41.555
HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
WERE ALL MURDERED
IN THE FAMILY'S HOME.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.426
THEY WERE ALL FORCED
TO DRINK BLEACH

18:43.470 --> 18:45.124
BEFORE BEING SHOT TWICE
IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD

18:45.167 --> 18:47.387
WITH A .40-CALIBER PISTOL.
IT MUST BE RAMOS.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.215
WHERE WAS GRANT
WHEN IT HAPPENED?

18:49.258 --> 18:51.086
GARCIA: HE WAS OUT OF
THE COUNTRY ON ASSIGNMENT.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.002
HE DISCOVERED THE BODIES.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.178
SOMEHOW RAMOS MUST HAVE
GOTTEN A LIST

18:56.222 --> 18:57.875
OF EVERYBODY INVOLVED
WITH HIS ARREST.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.355
AND HE WENT AFTER
THE GRANTS FIRST

18:59.399 --> 19:01.096
BECAUSE THEY LIVED
THE CLOSEST.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.012
AFTER THAT, HE LIKELY
WOULD HAVE GONE AFTER
SILVA AND HIS MEN,

19:04.055 --> 19:06.580
AND THEN CROSSED STATESIDE
AND COME AFTER US.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.408
BUT GRANT GOT TO HIM FIRST.

19:08.451 --> 19:11.193
WE PROFILED GRANT
AS EITHER A HIT MAN
OR A MORAL ENFORCER,

19:11.237 --> 19:13.152
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY BOTH.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.979
HE'S A MORAL ENFORCER
POSING AS A HIT MAN.
IT'S THE PERFECT COVER.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.112
WE NEED TO FIND
EVERYONE ASSOCIATED
WITH THE CARTEL

19:17.156 --> 19:18.635
IN THIS IMMEDIATE AREA.

19:18.679 --> 19:19.767
THAT'S WHERE HE'S
HEADING NEXT.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.682
THE DEA's JUST
GIVEN US 3 MORE

19:21.725 --> 19:24.467
SUSPECTED MARTINEZ CARTEL
CONTACTS IN THE D.C. AREA.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.165
I JUST SENT YOU ALL
THEIR INFO, GARCIA.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.732
ON IT. KEN RONSON,
STEVE BAGNIS,

19:28.776 --> 19:30.343
KATHLEEN JENSEN.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.040
I'VE SENT YOU THEIR
HOME AND WORK ADDRESSES.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.650
PHIL, DO YOU RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THEM?

19:33.694 --> 19:35.043
NO.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.784
OK, THEN WE HAVE TO ASSUME
ALL 3 ARE STILL IN PLAY.

19:36.827 --> 19:37.785
LET'S SPLIT UP AND GO.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.743
YEAH. I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

19:39.787 --> 19:42.137
YEAH, YOU BETTER.
I'LL STAY BY MY PHONE.

19:50.450 --> 19:53.192
ALVEZ: KEN RONSON. FBI.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.672
WHAT?
WHAT IS THIS?

19:55.716 --> 19:57.021
WHERE'S YOUR FAMILY?

19:57.065 --> 19:58.806
IS IT RAMOS?

19:58.849 --> 20:00.808
NO.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.462
IT'S SOMEONE
WORSE THAN HIM.
WORSE?

20:02.505 --> 20:03.637
WHERE IS YOUR FAMILY?

20:03.680 --> 20:05.247
INSIDE.
THEY'RE INSIDE.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.988
I WAS JUST ON
THE PHONE WITH MY WIFE.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.163
SHE PACKED OUR BAGS.
WE'RE LEAVING TOWN.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.730
I HEARD RAMOS
WAS COMING.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.035
WE'LL PUT
THE 3 OF YOU IN
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY

20:11.079 --> 20:12.123
UNTIL IT'S SAFE.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.995
MANNY, IT'S GRANT.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.258
THIS WHOLE TIME IT'S
BEEN JEREMY GRANT.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.173
GRANT: I KNOW.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.784
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GRANT?

20:20.828 --> 20:22.133
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH MANNY?

20:22.177 --> 20:24.092
NOTHING...YET.

20:24.135 --> 20:27.182
I ONLY CLONED HIS NUMBER
SO YOU COULDN'T TRACE IT.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.139
JEREMY, YOU HAVE TO STOP.

20:28.183 --> 20:30.751
REALLY, I HAVE TO STOP?

20:30.794 --> 20:32.318
OPEN YOUR EYES, LUKE.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.755
IF I WOULDN'T HAVE
STARTED AND KILLED RAMOS,

20:34.798 --> 20:36.322
YOU'D ALREADY BE DEAD.

20:36.365 --> 20:38.237
SO YOU'RE WELCOME
FOR THAT.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.152
THIS IS NOT HOW
WE DO THINGS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.067
WHAT I KNOW IS
THAT MANNY WAS RIGHT.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.026
YOU GET A CHANCE
TO PUT A BULLET

20:45.069 --> 20:47.376
IN A SON OF A BITCH
LIKE RAMOS, YOU TAKE IT.

20:47.420 --> 20:50.118
ARREST HIM.
THAT WAS THE ORDER.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.120
AND THAT ORDER GOT
MY FAMILY KILLED.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.296
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR FAMILY.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.299
YOU GOT YOUR REVENGE
ON RAMOS.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.127
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'S
YOUR PLAN NOW,

20:59.170 --> 21:00.998
KILL EVERYONE IN
THE WHOLE CARTEL?

21:01.042 --> 21:02.304
NO.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.306
JUST EVERYONE WHO
RATTED OUT RAMOS,

21:04.350 --> 21:06.177
EVERYONE INVOLVED
IN THE TAKEDOWN.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.179
THAT INCLUDES ME,
DOESN'T IT?

21:08.223 --> 21:10.834
NO, YOU GET TO LIVE.

21:10.878 --> 21:13.707
SAME WAY I DO,

21:13.750 --> 21:15.186
TORTURED BY
THE KNOWLEDGE

21:15.230 --> 21:17.145
THAT YOUR DECISIONS
GOT THAT ONE PERSON

21:17.188 --> 21:18.755
YOU LOVE MOST KILLED.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.235
JEREMY, NO.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.759
SHOULD HAVE LET ME
TAKE THE SHOT, ALVEZ.

21:30.811 --> 21:33.727
SIMMONS: LUKE!

21:33.770 --> 21:36.338
[CAR DOOR CLOSES,
ENGINE STARTS]

21:38.209 --> 21:39.689
GARCIA.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.131
LISA: LISA'S PHONE.
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.524
COME ON, PICK UP.

21:48.568 --> 21:49.917
LISA, IT'S ME AGAIN.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.267
PLEASE JUST CALL
OR TEXT ME, ALL RIGHT?

21:52.311 --> 21:53.660
I NEED TO KNOW
YOU'RE OK.

21:53.703 --> 21:56.140
CALL LISA.

21:57.446 --> 21:59.448
LISA: LISA'S PHONE.
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

21:59.492 --> 22:01.363
PICK UP!

22:01.407 --> 22:04.366
THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN
ROUTED AND RE-ROUTED.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.021
THIS GUY IS GOOD, MATT.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.239
BUT I PINGED LUKE'S PHONE,

22:08.283 --> 22:09.980
AND HE'S ON HIS WAY HOME
IN A HURRY.

22:10.024 --> 22:11.286
WAIT.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.983
SIMMONS, OVER PHONE:
GARCIA?

22:13.027 --> 22:15.899
LUKE'S HOUSE.
WHATEVER THAT PHONE CALL WAS,

22:15.943 --> 22:17.031
IT HAS TO DO WITH
LUKE'S HOUSE

22:17.074 --> 22:18.772
BECAUSE HE'S ON HIS
WAY THERE AND...

22:18.815 --> 22:21.252
LISA. LISA'S AT HOME.

22:21.296 --> 22:23.037
OH, MY GOD, MATT.SIMMONS: ON MY WAY.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.169
OK, YOU NEED TO GET
THERE IN A HURRY,

22:25.213 --> 22:26.562
AND I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA
LET THE REST OF THE TEAM KNOW.

22:26.606 --> 22:27.911
IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.173
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

22:29.217 --> 22:31.045
LUKE AND LISA.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.176
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

22:32.220 --> 22:33.613
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S JUST A GUT CALL,

22:33.656 --> 22:36.224
BUT I THINK--I THINK
LISA'S IN TROUBLE.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.704
MATT'S ON HIS WAY
TO THEIR HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.009
OK, I'LL GET ROSSI
AND JJ.

22:39.053 --> 22:39.923
WE'LL MEET HIM THERE.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.229
OK. OH, DEAR GOD.

22:41.272 --> 22:42.448
OH, DEAR GOD,
PLEASE NOT AGAIN.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.101
THIS TEAM'S GONE
THROUGH ENOUGH.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.196
ALVEZ: OH, GOD.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.808
LISA?

22:54.851 --> 22:58.028
LISA!

22:58.072 --> 22:59.116
OH, THANK GOD.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.857
WHAT THE HELL?

23:00.901 --> 23:02.381
THANK GOD YOU'RE OK.

23:02.424 --> 23:05.209
I'M FINE. WHAT'S--
WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:05.253 --> 23:06.297
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
IN TROUBLE.

23:06.341 --> 23:07.386
LUKE.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.909
BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.519
LUKE.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.394
WHAT?

23:15.437 --> 23:17.744
PHIL.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.456
ANY LAST WORDS?

23:34.500 --> 23:38.373
GO...TO HELL.

24:05.531 --> 24:08.969
OFFICER: POLICE!
PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.451
I SAID PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON,

24:12.494 --> 24:13.669
THEN GET ON YOUR KNEES

24:13.713 --> 24:15.541
AND PUT YOUR HANDS
ON YOUR HEAD.

24:20.633 --> 24:23.200
I'M ON DUTY.

24:23.244 --> 24:26.508
SUPERVISORY SPECIAL
AGENT LUKE ALVEZ

24:26.552 --> 24:30.643
WITH THE FBI's BEHAVIORAL
ANALYSIS UNIT.

24:30.686 --> 24:33.472
MY BADGE IS MY RIGHT
BACK POCKET.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.449
OH, MY GOD, LUKE.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.627
I'M SO SORRY.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.411
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU,
BROTHER.

25:00.455 --> 25:02.588
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED, JUST LET US KNOW.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.982
CAN YOU WATCH LOU
FOR A FEW HOURS?

25:06.026 --> 25:07.549
ABSOLUTELY.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.670
I WAS JUST COMING
TO FIND YOU.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.759
CAN WE TALK?

25:43.803 --> 25:45.456
COME IN.

25:54.378 --> 25:57.207
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA ASK ME,

25:57.251 --> 25:59.645
BUT I CAN'T LET YOU
STAY ON THIS CASE.

26:02.735 --> 26:06.652
YOU'RE A POTENTIAL TARGET
OF A TRAINED ASSASSIN.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.958
NOW, I KNOW YOU'VE
REQUESTED A PROTECTED DETAIL

26:09.002 --> 26:10.569
AT THE HOUSE FOR LISA,

26:10.612 --> 26:12.788
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER
IS YOU NEED ONE, TOO.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.140
STANDING OPERATING
PROCEDURE.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.534
I GET IT.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.754
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.234
AND WE WON'T REST

26:24.278 --> 26:25.975
UNTIL WE CATCH
JEREMY GRANT.

26:26.019 --> 26:27.324
I PROMISE.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.807
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

26:31.851 --> 26:33.896
YEAH.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.856
YEAH, I NEED TO GET
HOME AND SEE LISA.

26:38.945 --> 26:41.034
I SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF HER.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.865
AND I NEED TO START
MAKING PHONE CALLS

26:45.908 --> 26:48.650
AND PAYING VISITS.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.478
PHIL'S PARENTS...

26:53.873 --> 26:56.963
HIS BROTHER
AND HIS SISTERS,

26:57.006 --> 27:00.749
HIS ARMY BUDDIES
AND MANHUNTERS,

27:00.793 --> 27:02.055
PEOPLE IN C.I.D.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.752
UM...

27:06.146 --> 27:09.062
I NEED A LITTLE LEEWAY
WITH THIS DETAIL ON ME.

27:09.105 --> 27:11.325
OK.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.849
BUT THEN I'LL NEED
REGULAR CHECK-INS FROM YOU.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.416
ABSOLUTELY.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.334
WE GOOD?

27:23.685 --> 27:25.034
WE'RE GOOD.

27:40.180 --> 27:43.009
PRENTISS: JEREMY GRANT
HAS KILLED MULTIPLE PEOPLE.

27:43.052 --> 27:44.706
NOW THAT HE'S MURDERED
A FEDERAL AGENT,

27:44.750 --> 27:47.230
HE KNOWS THE FULL WEIGHT
OF EVERY AGENCY

27:47.274 --> 27:49.711
IN THE U.S. LAW
ENFORCEMENT MACHINE
WILL BE LOOKING FOR HIM.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.365
REID: WE KNOW FROM HIS
PROFILE HE'S NOT SUICIDAL.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.062
EXACTLY. SO HE'LL
GO UNDERGROUND,

27:53.106 --> 27:55.108
WHICH MEANS HE'LL
EITHER FLEE THE COUNTRY

27:55.151 --> 27:56.718
OR WAIT FOR
THE STORM TO PASS.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.851
HE'S A SNIPER WITH
RESOURCES ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE BORDER.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.810
RIGHT. THESE GUYS ARE
TRAINED TO HAVE SAFE HOUSES
AND BACKSTOPS.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.116
PRENTISS: OK, THAT'S
WHERE WE START.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.335
I WANT A FULL BACKGROUND
ON GRANT'S DEA HISTORY--

28:05.379 --> 28:08.730
MISSIONS, KNOWN ASSOCIATES,
ANYONE OR ANYTHING

28:08.774 --> 28:10.906
THAT WOULD HELP KEEP HIM
OFF THE RADAR.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.300
JJ's RIGHT, HE WILL TRY
AND GO UNDERGROUND,

28:13.343 --> 28:15.650
BUT BEFORE HE DOES,

28:15.694 --> 28:18.871
I HAVE A FEELING HE'S
GOING TO WANT TO GET IN
ONE FINAL SHOT.

28:31.884 --> 28:33.973
THANKS, GUYS

28:35.322 --> 28:37.846
MATT TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE HE LEFT.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.718
I'M SO SORRY, LUKE.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.859
GO PACK A BAG.

28:50.903 --> 28:51.773
PACK A BAG?

28:51.817 --> 28:53.253
WAIT.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.559
YOU NEED TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.083
THE GUY THAT KILLED PHIL,
I KNEW HIM.

28:57.126 --> 28:58.780
I WORKED WITH HIM.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.608
AND THE TWO COPS
OUTSIDE THE DOOR

29:00.651 --> 29:01.740
AREN'T GOING TO BE
ABLE TO STOP HIM.

29:01.783 --> 29:02.915
YOU KNEW HIM?

29:02.958 --> 29:04.481
YEAH.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.137
LOOK, I GOT AN ARMY
RANGER BUDDY OF MINE

29:08.181 --> 29:10.357
COMING TO PICK UP
YOU AND ROXY.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.490
OK? JOHN AND HIS WIFE CARLA.
THEY LIVE OFF THE GRID.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.579
YOU'LL BE SECURE WITH THEM.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.712
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN IT'S SAFE.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.800
YOU'LL CALL?

29:18.844 --> 29:19.845
YOU'RE NOT COMING
WITH US?

29:19.888 --> 29:21.890
NO.

29:21.934 --> 29:24.153
BECAUSE YOU'RE
GOING AFTER HIM.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.112
LOOK AT ME, OK?

29:26.155 --> 29:28.244
JUST LOOK AT ME.

29:28.288 --> 29:30.420
YOUR BEST FRIEND
WAS MURDERED,

29:30.464 --> 29:32.509
AND I KNOW
YOU'RE HURTING,

29:32.553 --> 29:34.642
BUT DON'T DO THIS.

29:34.685 --> 29:38.820
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.302
I HAVE TO.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.138
HEY.

29:52.181 --> 29:53.835
HEY, I'M ALMOST DONE
COMPILING THIS LIST

29:53.879 --> 29:55.924
OF BUSES AND TRAINS
GRANT COULD GET OUT
OF TOWN IN.

29:55.968 --> 29:58.187
GREAT. I HAVE
A STRANGE REQUEST.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.754
I NEED YOU TO FIND
LUKE'S PHONE.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.060
OK.

30:01.103 --> 30:05.151
UH, LUKE IS AT HOME.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.849
AHH, HE'S SMART.
HE'D LEAVE HIS PHONE.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.765
LOOK, I HATE TO
DO THIS, BUT...

30:10.809 --> 30:12.854
GRANT ISN'T THE ONLY
ONE WITH SKILLS.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.900
WHEN LUKE WAS A MANHUNTER,
HE'D GO UNDERCOVER.

30:14.943 --> 30:17.946
THAT MEANS FAKE IDENTITIES
AND MULTIPLE PHONES.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.427
I NEED TO SEE IF ANY
OF THOSE PHONES
ARE ACTIVE NOW.

30:20.470 --> 30:22.646
OK. THAT'S GONNA
TAKE A MINUTE.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.866
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S UP TO?

30:26.607 --> 30:28.043
PRENTISS: I'M AFRAID LUKE
MIGHT TAKE MATTERS

30:28.087 --> 30:29.784
INTO HIS OWN HANDS.

30:47.933 --> 30:48.759
ALVEZ: WHAT IS THIS?

30:48.803 --> 30:51.545
BACK UP.
JUST IN CASE.

30:53.025 --> 30:54.940
YOU REALLY NEED
ALL OF THIS?

30:54.983 --> 30:56.767
WE WORK MANHUNTERS,

30:56.811 --> 30:59.161
TRACKING DOWN THE
BADDEST OF THE BAD.

30:59.205 --> 31:01.729
AND WHEN WE WIN,
IT CAUSES VENDETTAS.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.862
THE FBI HAS FAIL-SAFES
TO PROTECT US.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.907
YEAH, LIKE THAT'S GONNA
SAVE US IN TIME.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.517
WHO ELSE KNOWS
ABOUT THIS?

31:07.561 --> 31:08.867
JUST US.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.173
WHAT'S IN THERE?

31:12.566 --> 31:14.481
NEW IDENTITIES.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.268
THESE ARE PRETTY
DAMN GOOD.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.791
WHERE'D YOU GET THEM?

31:20.835 --> 31:23.490
IN MEXICO GRANT TOLD ME
ABOUT HIS GOOD FRIEND.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.971
THE GUY'S A FORGER.
HE LIVES AND WORKS
AROUND HERE.

31:26.014 --> 31:27.233
HOW MUCH?

31:27.276 --> 31:28.930
THIS WILL COVER IT.

31:28.974 --> 31:32.107
HALF UP FRONT,
HALF ON DELIVERY.

31:32.151 --> 31:34.718
HOW DO I GET
AHOLD OF HIM?

31:34.762 --> 31:36.503
I GOT HIS NUMBER.

31:36.546 --> 31:37.939
THE GUY'S FAST, TOO.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.115
ONLY TAKES HIM AN HOUR
START TO FINISH,

31:40.159 --> 31:44.163
AND THEN YOU'LL BE
A BRAND-NEW MAN.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.043
JJ:
THERE AREN'T MANY
FLIGHTS OUT

31:55.087 --> 31:56.349
THIS TIME OF NIGHT.

31:56.392 --> 31:58.917
I'VE GOT ONE, MAYBE TWO
POSSIBLE OPTIONS.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.440
AIRPORT'S RISKY,
EVEN FOR HIM.

32:00.483 --> 32:02.050
IT'S WALL-TO-WALL
CAMERAS.

32:02.094 --> 32:03.573
YEAH, BUT HE'S
ARROGANT ENOUGH

32:03.617 --> 32:04.792
TO THINK HE COULD
BEAT THEM.

32:04.835 --> 32:07.012
GARCIA COMPILED A LIST
OF BUSES AND TRAINS

32:07.055 --> 32:09.449
THAT PASS THROUGH OR
ORIGINATE IN THE AREA
AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT.

32:09.492 --> 32:10.754
WE HAVE 3 GOOD OPTIONS,

32:10.798 --> 32:12.278
AND I ALREADY HAVE HER
PULLING CCTV FOOTAGE

32:12.321 --> 32:13.670
AND PASSENGER MANIFESTS.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.803
OK, YOU KNOW,
WE NEED TO JUST

32:15.846 --> 32:17.239
STEP BACK A SECOND

32:17.283 --> 32:19.024
AND STOP THINKING
ABOUT GRANT

32:19.067 --> 32:20.199
LIKE HE'S A TOURIST.

32:20.242 --> 32:22.114
WE NEED TO START
THINKING ABOUT THIS

32:22.157 --> 32:24.507
LIKE HE'S, I DON'T
KNOW, TRYING TO
SMUGGLE HIMSELF OUT.

32:24.551 --> 32:27.554
REID: IN THAT CASE,
WE SHOULD LOOK AT
COMMERCIAL TRUCKING ROUTES.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.077
IT WOULD TAKE TIME
AND COORDINATION,

32:29.121 --> 32:30.339
BUT IT'S A GOOD WAY
OUT OF THE COUNTRY,

32:30.383 --> 32:32.124
ALTHOUGH IT DOES LIMIT
HIS DESTINATION OPTIONS.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.995
OK, NOW WHAT ABOUT
INTERNATIONAL WATERS?

32:34.039 --> 32:35.779
ONCE YOU'RE OUT THERE,
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.129
YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH
GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.174
THERE'S SMALLER MARINAS
OFF THE POTOMAC,

32:39.218 --> 32:40.654
AND THERE'S THE PORTS.

32:40.697 --> 32:43.004
WELL, ALEXANDRIA'S
THE CLOSEST TO D.C.,
BUT IT'S SMALL.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.701
IF GRANT REALLY WANTED
TO BLEND WITH A CROWD,

32:44.745 --> 32:46.007
HE'D HEAD DOWN
TO BALTIMORE.

32:46.051 --> 32:47.182
BY OVERALL DOLLAR
VALUE OF CARGO,

32:47.226 --> 32:48.531
IT'S THE NINTH BIGGEST
PORT IN THE U.S.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.577
AIRPORTS, MARINAS,
BUS TERMINALS.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.058
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
THE REST OF THE TEAM
AND GET STARTED.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.542
WHAT COUNTRY YOU WANT?

32:59.586 --> 33:01.283
SAME ONE YOU MADE
FOR JEREMY GRANT.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.285
DON'T KNOW HIM.
SORRY.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.461
NO, I THINK YOU DO.

33:05.505 --> 33:08.377
IN FACT, I THINK YOU
SAW HIM TONIGHT.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.467
NOW, WHERE'S HE GOING?

33:16.124 --> 33:18.648
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
I DON'T KNOW.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.476
SERIOUSLY,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.740
SWEAR TO GOD,
NO FREAKIN' IDEA, OK?
OH, COME ON, MAN.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.046
IF YOU'VE GOT A BEEF
WITH HIM, THAT'S
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.526
LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.

33:26.569 --> 33:29.398
I WILL, ONCE YOU TELL ME
WHERE HE'S GOING.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.705
IT'S A COMPLICATED PROCESS.

33:31.748 --> 33:34.012
NO, IT'S NOT.

33:35.187 --> 33:38.625
EITHER YOU TELL ME
AND YOU LIVE,

33:38.668 --> 33:40.453
OR DON'T AND DIE,

33:40.496 --> 33:42.281
BECAUSE I WILL PULL
THE TRIGGER.

33:45.545 --> 33:48.939
HE'S HEADED TO THE PORT
IN BALTIMORE.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.680
JUST DON'T KILL ME.

34:38.902 --> 34:40.948
GRANT!

34:50.175 --> 34:52.046
GARCIA, WE'RE MINUTES
AWAY FROM THE MARINA.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.918
GARCIA: TURN AROUND.
TURN AROUND RIGHT NOW.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.703
JEREMY GRANT IS IN
BALTIMORE AT THE PORT.

34:56.746 --> 34:58.139
BUT WE ALREADY
RULED OUT THAT PORT.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.271
I KNOW, BUT LUKE.

34:59.314 --> 35:00.141
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

35:00.185 --> 35:01.664
I HAD A HUNCH
ABOUT LUKE,

35:01.708 --> 35:03.144
SO I HAD GARCIA
KEEP TABS ON ALL
THE PHONES

35:03.188 --> 35:04.537
HE USED DURING HIS
UNDERCOVER DAYS

35:04.580 --> 35:05.799
IN THE MANHUNTER UNIT.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.627
YEAH, ALL THOSE PHONES
ARE DEAD EXCEPT FOR ONE,

35:07.670 --> 35:09.368
AND IT IS PINGING
RIGHT AT THE PORT.

35:09.411 --> 35:10.804
THANKS, GARCIA.
WE'RE TURNING AROUND.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.160
LUKE.

36:07.382 --> 36:10.777
PHIL: MAKE THE ARREST, LUKE.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.648
WE'RE NOT ABOVE THE LAW.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.607
SIMMONS: LUKE!

36:18.785 --> 36:21.309
IT'S OK.

36:21.353 --> 36:22.702
GIVE ME THE GUN.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.315
IT'S OK.

36:27.359 --> 36:28.925
IT'S OK.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.930
GET UP.

36:42.591 --> 36:45.594
I TOLD YOU YOU HAD TO
SIT THIS ONE OUT.

36:45.638 --> 36:48.118
YEAH. I KNOW.

36:48.162 --> 36:50.164
YOU DEFIED A DIRECT ORDER.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.907
I CAN'T LET IT SLIDE.

36:55.604 --> 36:58.999
BECAUSE A SHOT WAS FIRED,
OPR WILL TAKE YOUR GUN.

36:59.042 --> 37:00.740
I'M NOT ASKING FOR
YOUR BADGE YET,

37:00.783 --> 37:02.829
BUT I AM PLACING
FIELD RESTRICTIONS ON YOU.

37:02.872 --> 37:06.659
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE,
YOU WILL WORK OUT OF THE BAU.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.965
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO TRAVEL WITH THE TEAM.

37:09.009 --> 37:12.230
THERE WILL ALSO BE
A FORMAL DEMOTION.

37:12.273 --> 37:14.232
YOU'LL BE DOWNGRADED
FROM SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT

37:14.275 --> 37:15.798
TO SPECIAL AGENT.

37:15.842 --> 37:19.193
NEITHER OF THOSE ARE
NECESSARILY PERMANENT.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.196
YOU CAN EARN BACK
BOTH PRIVILEGES,

37:22.240 --> 37:24.154
BUT IT WON'T BE EASY.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.721
IS THAT CLEAR?

37:29.421 --> 37:30.900
IS THAT CLEAR?

37:32.032 --> 37:33.555
YEAH.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.557
GOOD.

37:37.516 --> 37:39.431
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU
DIDN'T KILL HIM,

37:39.474 --> 37:41.694
OR YOU'D BE GONE FOREVER.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.593
HEY.

38:11.637 --> 38:14.248
IT'S NOT THAI.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.817
BUT I KNOW YOU LIKE THAT
DINER DOWN ON SIXTH STREET.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.828
GIVE ME A REASON
NOT TO LEAVE.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.440
THE THREAT'S OVER.

38:32.484 --> 38:33.485
IT'S SAFE.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.617
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

38:42.145 --> 38:46.019
I MET PHIL BROOKS
ON AUGUST 10, 2007...

38:47.629 --> 38:50.197
AFTER AN ATTACK ON MOSUL.

38:52.982 --> 38:56.377
BODY COUNT WAS HIGH.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.901
THE HIGHEST
I'D EVER SEEN.

39:02.949 --> 39:07.083
AND THIS LITTLE GIRL...

39:07.127 --> 39:09.825
THIS LITTLE GIRL
DIED IN MY ARMS.

39:16.919 --> 39:19.052
PHIL WAS THERE.

39:21.663 --> 39:23.883
IT SOUNDS STUPID,
BUT, UH...

39:25.275 --> 39:28.366
HE WAS THE FIRST GUY
THAT I EVER CRIED
IN FRONT OF.

39:39.681 --> 39:43.859
AND WE BOTH GOT
INTO THE FBI.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.905
WHEN WE THOUGHT HE
LOST HIS LEGS,

39:45.948 --> 39:48.864
WE...WE CRIED AGAIN.

40:00.746 --> 40:03.662
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD,
YOU KNOW,

40:03.705 --> 40:05.620
THIS JOB.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.059
IT'S HARD
TO FIND SOMEONE

40:10.103 --> 40:13.367
THAT YOU FEEL
SAFE WITH.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.991
YOU'RE SAFE WITH ME.
