[Lemony]  Unless you were born yesterday,

01:33.958 --> 01:36.666
in which case,
welcome to the world, little baby,

01:36.750 --> 01:40.166
you have probably observed
that things aren't always what they seem.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.541
The surface of a pond might seem calm,

01:42.625 --> 01:45.833
when, in reality, any number of secrets
might be hidden beneath it.

01:45.916 --> 01:48.125
The world is like a pond that way.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.541
When you perform even
the tiniest of actions,

01:50.625 --> 01:51.958
like dropping a stone...

01:54.291 --> 01:55.500
it can ripple,

01:55.583 --> 01:57.708
until the entire world has been changed.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.125
My name is Lemony Snicket,

02:00.208 --> 02:03.041
and I recommend you drop
your streaming device into a pond.

02:03.125 --> 02:05.416
Your world will be changed for the better,

02:05.500 --> 02:09.125
since you will not have to watch
the sad story of the Baudelaire orphans.

02:09.666 --> 02:13.250
You will be spared the tragic tale
of the Hotel Denouement.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.416

the suspicious parties staying there,

[Kit]  Things aren't always
what they seem, Baudelaires.

02:33.666 --> 02:35.208
It may seem like I'm speeding recklessly

02:35.291 --> 02:38.291
because I'm a taxi driver who doesn't care
about traffic safety laws,

02:38.375 --> 02:40.875
but really, I'm trying to shake the car
that's been following us.

02:40.958 --> 02:42.041
There's a car following us?

02:42.125 --> 02:44.500
[Kit] I suspect it belongs
to a pair of sinister villains

02:44.583 --> 02:46.916
I recently encountered on a mountain.
We were there too.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.916
I know exactly where you've been,
Klaus Baudelaire.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.083
I wish I could have helped you all along,

02:51.166 --> 02:53.166
but ever since the schism,
there have been more fires

02:53.250 --> 02:55.125
than even a Volunteer Fire Department
can put out.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.208
Those look like they burned down recently.

02:57.291 --> 02:58.500
Our enemies are getting bolder.

02:58.583 --> 03:02.375

03:06.416 --> 03:07.916
I know you have thousands of questions,

and I wish I had time to answer them
over a leisurely brunch,

03:10.541 --> 03:13.291
but our agents are already on their way
to the Last Safe Place,

03:13.375 --> 03:15.458
so I'm afraid you'll have to settle
for a quick debrief

03:15.541 --> 03:16.916
and a picnic in the back of a taxi.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.666
There's a picnic basket on the floor.

03:19.750 --> 03:22.791
You said your name is Kit Snicket.
We met a man named Jacques Snicket.

03:22.875 --> 03:23.833
He was my brother.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.750
And he's the reason I need your help.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.333
I received this telegram
instructing all volunteers

03:29.416 --> 03:31.125
to go to the Hotel Denouement on Thursday,

03:31.208 --> 03:33.625
and it's signed
with my brother's initials, "J.S."

03:33.708 --> 03:37.041
We received the same telegram,
but it can't be from Jacques. He's...

03:37.500 --> 03:38.458
Yes, Baudelaires.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.041
I know that my brother is dead.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.500
And I know that you tried to save him,

03:43.583 --> 03:47.250
but I'm afraid someone is impersonating
him to gather all of V.F.D. in one place.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.666
We could be walking into a trap.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.166
So you need to find out if this J.S.
is a friend or an enemy.

03:51.250 --> 03:52.750
Do you know what a flaneur is?

03:52.833 --> 03:55.041
A person who observes
their surroundings, like a spy.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.875
Very good.
Children make the best flaneurs,

03:56.958 --> 03:58.791
since adults rarely pay attention to them.

03:58.875 --> 04:02.000
There's a secret compartment in the bottom
of the picnic basket. Open it.

04:06.583 --> 04:08.083
Uniforms?
Disguises.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.708
Baudelaires, I need your help.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.541
I need you to infiltrate
the Hotel Denouement as concierge

04:12.625 --> 04:15.208
and learn the identity of J.S.
before Thursday.

04:15.291 --> 04:17.458
I have an inside man
who's made all the arrangements.

04:17.541 --> 04:19.333
All you have to say is yes.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.125
Say you'll volunteer.

at least nine traffic safety laws,

Ernest.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.416
Do not trust him, no matter what he says.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.625
The schism has turned many siblings
into enemies.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.750
Remember, F is for Frank, who is friendly.

07:25.833 --> 07:27.541
E is for Ernest, who is evil.

07:27.625 --> 07:29.125
How can we tell them apart?

07:29.208 --> 07:31.875
Unfortunately, the only way to determine
if someone is noble or wicked

07:31.958 --> 07:33.125
is through close observation.

07:33.208 --> 07:34.625
Be careful about what you tell them

07:34.708 --> 07:36.958
because if the wrong brother
finds out what we're up to...

07:42.791 --> 07:43.791
we could all be in danger.

07:44.791 --> 07:45.916
I've sent a message to Frank.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.583
He'll meet you in the lobby,
unless it was intercepted by Ernest.

we'll send a signal to warn V.F.D.

We're going to disguise ourselves
as concierges

07:59.166 --> 08:01.416
to determine if J.S. is a villain
or a volunteer.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.208
A manager named Frank will try to help us,

08:03.291 --> 08:04.958

when she needed to think, too.

And your father always adjusted
his glasses like that before a mission.

It's hard to believe our parents
went on secret missions.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.166
Your parents put many brave deeds
on the books.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.125
Without them, V.F.D. would never
have survived after the schism.

08:33.208 --> 08:36.625
We heard about the schism,
but we still don't know what it was about.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.458
It's a long story, but it all began
one night at the opera,

08:39.541 --> 08:41.750

of  La Forza del Destino.

accidentally goes off and kills somebody?

08:46.250 --> 08:48.583
I'm sorry, melancholy is a side effect
of my condition.

08:48.666 --> 08:50.541

Good luck, Baudelaires.

And please be careful.

Funny, I was hoping you'd stay.
I'll be back tonight.

09:26.750 --> 09:29.583
And if everything goes according to plan,
we'll have the sugar bowl.

09:29.666 --> 09:32.250
We can end this, once and for all.
Then what?

09:32.333 --> 09:33.750
You, me,

09:34.166 --> 09:36.708

09:36.791 --> 09:38.166
Her? Is that a fact?

09:38.250 --> 09:39.291
It's just a feeling.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.833
I never want to be apart from you again,
except in the restroom, at work,

09:42.916 --> 09:45.500
and when one of us is at a movie
the other one doesn't want to see.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.125
I'll see you tonight.

09:50.833 --> 09:52.416

10:03.750 --> 10:06.416
Evidence of a picnic,
like evidence of a secret meeting,

10:06.500 --> 10:07.583
is best discarded,

10:07.666 --> 10:11.166

If I could go back in time,

I would tell him
that a light gray suit looks good, but...

10:33.541 --> 10:36.458
it is easier to hide in a darker shade.

I would tell him
that he is about to receive sad news

10:39.500 --> 10:41.500
about someone he loves very much.

10:42.750 --> 10:45.500
And I would tell him
to stay at the Hotel Denouement

10:46.291 --> 10:49.083
instead of leaving in a taxi
with his sister, but...

10:51.333 --> 10:52.958
I cannot change the past...

10:53.541 --> 10:56.500

from driving away.

A big hotel can work to our advantage.

11:11.833 --> 11:14.125
If Count Olaf turns up,
it won't be easy for him to find us.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.458
Bellhop, take the luggage to the room

11:16.541 --> 11:20.291
and the, uh,  Carmelita II  up to the roof.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.208
Thank you.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Remember, we have to convince any flaneurs

11:25.083 --> 11:27.833
that we're a normal, happy family
on vacation.

11:27.916 --> 11:31.083
I don't wanna stay at some cakesniffing
hotel! I want to go to Littlest Elf Land!

11:31.166 --> 11:34.625
Tell your darling little girl
to stop drawing so much attention.

11:34.708 --> 11:37.500
If you spent more time with her,
she wouldn't feel the need to act out.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.458
My real parents took me wherever I wanted.

11:39.541 --> 11:41.833
Some parents.
They wouldn't even pay the ransom.

11:42.166 --> 11:45.375
Your father is very stressed
about work, darling.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.791
We're going to go on a real vacation soon,
Mummy promises.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.541
Yes, lie to her.
That's excellent parenting.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.875
I need a drink.

11:50.958 --> 11:51.958
You!

11:54.375 --> 11:55.625
Concierge.

11:56.041 --> 11:59.833
Find the manager and tell him to bring
a nice bottle of wine to our room.

11:59.916 --> 12:01.958
Something red. A sauvignon blank.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.791
[gruffly] Yes, sir. [clears throat]

12:05.833 --> 12:08.791
The manager's on our side of the schism.
Well, one of them is, anyway.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.041
I hear this hotel has a spa,

12:10.125 --> 12:11.916
which is perfect
because I'd like a face peel.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.041
Do you get to pick whose face,
or you just peel it off whoever's around?

12:15.125 --> 12:18.250
-I don't think it works that way.
-Well, I need to relieve my stress somehow

12:18.333 --> 12:20.250
if you expect me
to be put in charge of planning--

12:20.333 --> 12:21.958
-Not in the lobby!
-Oh!

12:22.041 --> 12:24.875
There are eyes everywhere.
We'll talk about it in the room.

12:24.958 --> 12:26.166
I don't want to go to the room.

12:26.250 --> 12:30.000
I'm an adorable, beautiful, cute, dainty,
eye-pleasing, flawless girl,

12:30.083 --> 12:31.375
and I want to go to the pool!

12:33.291 --> 12:34.250
[bell dings]

12:35.708 --> 12:37.875
Remind me why we can't send her
back to her parents.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.625
We burned down their house
with them inside.

12:39.708 --> 12:42.000
Wait, what did you say?
Nothing, darling.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.458
-Why didn't he recognize us?
-He only saw our uniforms.

12:44.541 --> 12:47.750
The villainous hotel guests often treat
staff like they're invisible.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.750
Do you think Count Olaf
is the one posing as J.S.?

12:49.833 --> 12:51.750
I don't know, but it can't be good
that he's here.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.750
We have to find out
what he and Esmé are planning.

12:53.833 --> 12:55.208
Are you eavesdropping on our guests?

12:56.583 --> 12:58.458
We're doing the job
we were instructed to do.

12:58.541 --> 12:59.750
You must be our new concierges.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.750
Welcome to the hotel.
I'm one of the managers.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.250
Frank or Ernest?
Exactly.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.833
I'm happy you're here, even though
one of you is unusually short

13:05.916 --> 13:08.291
because we're unusually short-handed.
This way, please.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.458
The job of the concierge is to give
our guests everything they ask for.

13:14.541 --> 13:15.833
When they ring, you volunteer.

13:15.916 --> 13:18.958
What do those numbers mean?
There can't be 999 rooms in this hotel.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.708
That's an interesting question.
Do you know what they mean?

13:21.791 --> 13:23.291
[man] Some luggage arrived in a taxi,

13:23.375 --> 13:25.791
but the driver said
the guest won't get here until Thursday.

13:25.875 --> 13:26.708
Thursday?

13:27.208 --> 13:28.500
Excuse me, concierges.

13:30.708 --> 13:31.791
Do you think that was Frank?

13:31.875 --> 13:33.708
He used the word volunteer.
Maybe it was a code.

13:33.791 --> 13:36.625
Everything he said sounded like a code.
You must be our new concierges.

13:36.708 --> 13:38.875
Welcome to the Hotel Denouement.
I'm one of the managers.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.375
Are you Frank or Ernest?

13:41.458 --> 13:42.458
I am. You're just in time.

13:42.541 --> 13:44.958
We're anticipating a large number
of guests before Thursday.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.500
Do you know why?
We think so.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.333
Can you tell me?
Interesting question.

13:48.416 --> 13:51.333
That's a smart answer. It's hard to know
who you can trust in a hotel lobby.

13:51.416 --> 13:53.208
There are countless wicked people
in the world.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.333
Sooner or later,
some of them will check into a hotel.

13:55.416 --> 13:58.958
Sir,  The Daily Punctilio  arrived
with an update on those murderers.

13:59.041 --> 13:59.875
Murderers?

14:00.916 --> 14:02.250
Excuse me, concierges.

14:04.041 --> 14:06.875
That had to be Ernest. The part about
wicked people sounded like a threat.

14:06.958 --> 14:08.500
Unless it was a warning. I'm confused.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.083
-How are we supposed to find anyone?
-I can answer that question.

14:11.166 --> 14:14.000
Finding someone here
is as easy as finding a book in a library

14:14.083 --> 14:16.916
because the Hotel Denouement
is not organized like a hotel at all.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.666
It's organized like a library.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.166
Well, a library organizes knowledge

14:20.250 --> 14:22.375
according to a numerical
classification system.

14:22.458 --> 14:24.166
That's right. All guests at the hotel

14:24.250 --> 14:27.083
are placed in rooms according to where
they would be shelved in a library.

14:27.166 --> 14:30.000
But anyone who works here would have
to know the library catalog by heart.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.125
[bell dinging]

14:31.208 --> 14:34.375
Room 610. That's for our guests
associated with the healthcare industry.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.375
[bell ringing]

14:35.458 --> 14:37.375
332, financial economics.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.125
[Violet] That bell doesn't have a number.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.208
That's our rooftop sunbathing salon.

14:41.916 --> 14:44.458
People who sunbathe usually
aren't interested in library science,

14:44.541 --> 14:46.375
so they're not too picky about location.

14:46.458 --> 14:47.666
Three bells, three rooms.

14:47.750 --> 14:51.000
But you can't be in three places at once.
You'll have to split up, Baudelaires.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.916
You know our names?
Are you Frank or Ernest?

14:53.583 --> 14:57.083
-That's an interesting question.
-[bells ringing]

14:57.666 --> 14:58.708
Your assignments await.

15:13.833 --> 15:17.041
It is impossible for one person
to be in three places at once,

15:17.125 --> 15:20.208
unless, of course, that person
is viewing a television program.

15:21.125 --> 15:24.250
A person viewing a television program
does not have to choose

15:24.333 --> 15:27.875
between seeing Sunny's mysterious meeting
on the third floor...

15:30.583 --> 15:34.416
Klaus's discovery of a strange conspiracy
on the sixth floor...

15:36.916 --> 15:40.375
and Violet's dangerous dilemma
in the rooftop sunbathing salon.

15:40.458 --> 15:41.416
[bell dings]

15:41.500 --> 15:43.458
You may see all three of these things.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.333
Just... not at the same time.

15:46.666 --> 15:49.500
No one's ever looked good with a mustache,
so I guess I'll be the first.

15:51.666 --> 15:52.916
[bell dings]

15:53.000 --> 15:54.458
[Carmelita] Yippeekiyay, mateys!

15:54.875 --> 15:57.291
I'm a ballplaying cowboy superhero
soldier pirate!

15:57.375 --> 15:58.458
[Esmé] Of course you are.

15:58.541 --> 16:02.500
Carmelita's been exploring
her tomboy side. Isn't she adorable?

16:02.583 --> 16:04.458
As the vice principal of Prufrock Prep,

16:04.541 --> 16:06.541
I can tell you Carmelita
was always an adorable girl,

16:06.625 --> 16:09.083
and now she's an adorable tomboy!

16:09.166 --> 16:10.916
[Violet]
Some girls find "tomboy" insulting.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.791
That means their interests don't conform
to somebody else's expectations.

16:13.875 --> 16:17.458
[mocking] Some girls find tomboy to be
an insulting term that blah, blah, blah...

16:17.541 --> 16:19.583
Who dares interrupt a genius
when he's sunbathing?

16:19.666 --> 16:22.500
Must be the concierge. You're late.
I rang two whole minutes ago.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.750
What is it you require, ma'am?
Don't address me.

16:24.833 --> 16:28.208
I'd no sooner look at or speak to the help
than I would wear modest clothing.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.000
You're speaking to the help right now.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.875
I didn't summon you for your opinion.

16:31.958 --> 16:35.625
I summoned you to give
that adorable little girl in the yacht

16:35.708 --> 16:36.916
whatever her heart desires.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.041
Everyone, watch me shoot a hoop!

16:42.541 --> 16:45.750
Hey, concierge, I want an ice cream cone
with hot pink sprinkles,

16:45.833 --> 16:48.625
and bananas, and lemon sorbet
because I'm lactose intolerant.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.916
My daughter and I are here
on topsecret business.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.791
If I may gush like an open wound,
I'm not just a vice principal,

16:55.875 --> 16:59.625
but I'm also the vice president
of the Esmé Squalor Fan Club!

16:59.708 --> 17:00.666
I'm your number one fan.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.125
That is so charming.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.291
I don't do autographs.

17:05.375 --> 17:08.000
I'd love to hear more
about your topsecret business.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.916
I've read every story about you
in  The Daily Punctilio.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.583
You are so glamorous and important.
You remind me of myself.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.083
Please, tell me,
what are you planning next?

17:17.166 --> 17:20.166
That's top secret. But I can tell you
it's gonna be the "innest" cocktail party

17:20.250 --> 17:21.250
this hotel has ever seen.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.500
[Nero] A cocktail party!

17:22.583 --> 17:25.375
People are going to be so excited.
Some will probably have heart attacks!

17:25.458 --> 17:28.166
I hope so.
They're certainly in for a big surprise.

17:28.250 --> 17:31.791
What kind of surprise?
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.

17:32.375 --> 17:35.166
I don't mean to eavesdrop, but I'm
a member of the Esmé Squalor Fan Club,

17:35.250 --> 17:37.625
and I'd love to hear about a big surprise
at a cocktail party.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.208
Can't you give me a hint?
No!

17:39.666 --> 17:41.708
Pretty please! With sugar on top.

17:41.791 --> 17:43.666
I also want sugar on top.
No.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.458
Does it have to do with the spyglass?

17:46.041 --> 17:46.875
What spyglass?

17:46.958 --> 17:49.125
When I was watching you
from under that table,

17:49.208 --> 17:51.125
which I often do as your number one fan,

17:51.208 --> 17:53.833
I saw that you were watching the sky
with a spyglass.

17:54.291 --> 17:55.166
Why?

17:56.666 --> 17:57.958
Because...

18:07.166 --> 18:08.833
Bird-watching is "in."

18:08.916 --> 18:10.416
Bird-watching in!

18:10.500 --> 18:14.208
Wait until the readers of the Esmé Squalor
Fan Club newsletter hear about that!

18:14.291 --> 18:18.291
You're such a wonderfully nosy man.
You must know all sorts of information.

18:18.375 --> 18:19.375
Tell you what.

18:19.458 --> 18:22.708
I'll give you a hint about the secret
ingredient in my party's hors d'oeuvres

18:22.791 --> 18:27.375
if you tell me about a certain person
who's been inviting people to this hotel.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.000
[Esmé] Hmm?

18:29.375 --> 18:31.083
His initials start with J.S.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.333
[scoffs]

18:32.416 --> 18:35.291
You of all people should know
who know J.S. is!

18:36.083 --> 18:37.708
-He's your--
-Stupid cakesniffer!

18:37.791 --> 18:39.750
That concierge is just standing there

18:39.833 --> 18:42.333
instead of getting me
my lactose-free ice cream cone!

18:42.416 --> 18:43.958
I'm so sorry, Carmelita.

18:44.708 --> 18:48.083
Not so fast. How does a concierge
know my daughter's name?

18:53.416 --> 18:54.250
It's on her boat.

18:56.916 --> 18:57.791
That checks out.

18:59.125 --> 19:02.000
[Carmelita] Oh, there's one more thing
I forgot to tell you to get me.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.916
I want a harpoon gun.

19:14.625 --> 19:15.791
[bell dings]

19:18.750 --> 19:19.750
Excuse me, sir.

19:21.125 --> 19:21.958
Is there a problem?

19:22.041 --> 19:24.583
A guest asked for something.
I don't think I should give it to her.

19:24.666 --> 19:27.625
The job of the concierge is to give
the guests exactly what they ask for.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.958
Giving a harpoon gun to Carmelita Spats
would be wrong.

19:30.041 --> 19:31.958
But not giving it to her
would be suspicious.

19:34.125 --> 19:38.291
V.F.D. is aware of Ms. Spats' intentions,
and we've already taken them into account.

19:39.458 --> 19:42.791
Sometimes what seems wrong
is really part of a larger plan.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.583
Can I trust you, concierge?

19:47.625 --> 19:48.625
If I can trust you.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.791
The clock in the lobby
of the Hotel Denouement

19:51.875 --> 19:53.125
was the stuff of legend,

19:53.208 --> 19:56.708
a phrase which here means
"very famous for being very loud."

19:57.458 --> 19:59.666
The noise it makes
sounded a lot like a word,

19:59.750 --> 20:01.833
and that word described Violet Baudelaire

20:01.916 --> 20:06.291
as she prepared to carry a harpoon gun
to the rooftop sunbathing salon.

20:06.375 --> 20:11.125
[clock bongs, "Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!"]

20:18.333 --> 20:19.833
[bell dings]

20:32.333 --> 20:34.708
[door opens, panting]

20:35.625 --> 20:37.291
Thank goodness you got here so fast.

20:37.375 --> 20:39.416
I rang two minutes ago,
and it's an emergency.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.375
Babs?
How do you know my name?

20:42.083 --> 20:43.583
It's on your name tag.

20:44.625 --> 20:46.625
Well, that makes sense.
[nervous laughter]

20:46.708 --> 20:47.958
I'm sorry I'm so jumpy,

20:48.041 --> 20:49.750
but the last person I trusted tied me up,

20:49.833 --> 20:51.750
stole my clipboard,
and burned down my hospital.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.625
I'll never get that clipboard back.

20:53.708 --> 20:56.458
You said there was an emergency.
Yes, it's terrible.

20:56.541 --> 20:58.333
I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend
in the sauna,

20:58.416 --> 21:00.250
but this hotel is poorly organized,

21:00.333 --> 21:02.416
so I have no idea where it is.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.958
Well, the 200s are the library
catalog numbers for religion,

21:05.041 --> 21:07.291
and saunas are often a place
for spiritual contemplation,

21:07.375 --> 21:09.250
so the sauna is on the second floor.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.958
My, you're smart.

21:11.041 --> 21:13.041
Have you considered being a doctor?

21:13.791 --> 21:14.916
Right this way, ma'am.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.208
Your boyfriend should be inside.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.375
[man] Who's there?
I can't see a thing in this steam.

21:26.458 --> 21:29.000
It's your girlfriend! And the concierge.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.125
Ah, the concierge!

21:30.208 --> 21:32.166
I would love an aqueous Martini.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.791
I'm hooked, although I know
they're terribly out of style.

21:34.875 --> 21:35.875
You two are a couple?

21:35.958 --> 21:41.083
Yes! We met at a support group for people
who were terrorized by Esmé Squalor,

21:41.166 --> 21:42.541
and we fell hopelessly in love.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.833
Isn't that right, love of my life?

21:44.916 --> 21:48.916
It's definitely not a cover story,
fire of my loins.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.083
[nervously laughing]

21:51.166 --> 21:52.500
I'll get that Martini.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.166
[laughing continues]

21:55.916 --> 21:56.916
He's gone.

21:57.416 --> 22:00.416
[Babs] I'm so anxious. How long
do we have to keep this act up?

22:00.500 --> 22:02.375
[man] There are enemies in this hotel.

22:02.458 --> 22:04.416
We have to make them think
we're a happy couple

22:04.500 --> 22:07.583
if we want to help the Baudelaires.
That's what J.S. said in that telegram.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.000
Oh, the Baudelaires.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.041
Letting them go
was the biggest mistake of my life.

22:16.125 --> 22:18.166
I shouldn't have let that man
who said he was a doctor

22:18.250 --> 22:20.083
-nearly cut off their heads.
-Hmm.

22:20.958 --> 22:22.333
We just have to wait till Thursday.

22:22.416 --> 22:24.541
That's when all these unfortunate events
will be over

22:24.625 --> 22:27.000
and I go back to the real love of my life.

22:27.750 --> 22:31.208
We met at a support group for people
who have escaped horrible partners.

22:31.291 --> 22:34.000
He got a telegram from J.S. too,
but he couldn't be here.

22:34.083 --> 22:37.000
He's busy at his lumber mill.

22:37.625 --> 22:38.708
Oh, oh, oh.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.541
Well, I have someone too.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.833
She also received a telegram,
but couldn't make it either.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.666
She's in prison for bank robbery.

22:44.750 --> 22:45.916
Ah!

22:46.375 --> 22:49.500
Well, J.S. did say that everyone who's
ever met the Baudelaires was invited,

22:49.583 --> 22:51.750
so that makes sense.

22:51.833 --> 22:54.333
Excuse me. I have a telegram from J.S.,

22:54.416 --> 22:56.666
although I can't give it to you
until you give me his name.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.875
You mean her name. J.S. is a woman.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.541
I thought he was a sea captain.

23:00.625 --> 23:01.458
Hmm...

23:03.166 --> 23:04.958
Well, well, well.

23:05.833 --> 23:07.333
What do we have here?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.625
I fear I'm overdressed.

23:21.375 --> 23:22.250
It's blood.

23:22.916 --> 23:24.916
[Babs laughs nervously]

23:32.083 --> 23:34.458
Ah, there you are, concierge.
I have an important job for you.

23:34.541 --> 23:37.125
I need you to help me hang this
from the window of room 598,

23:37.208 --> 23:38.125
but we must be careful.

23:38.208 --> 23:41.083
It's so sticky that anything it touches
becomes instantly trapped.

23:41.166 --> 23:42.166
Is it flypaper?

23:42.250 --> 23:44.750
Yes, although our problem is not flies.
It's birds.

23:44.833 --> 23:45.916
You want me to hang flypaper

23:46.000 --> 23:48.666
out of the window of a hotel room
to trap birds? That seems strange.

23:48.750 --> 23:51.416
Sometimes what seems strange
is really part of a larger plan.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.708
Can I trust you, concierge?

23:55.041 --> 23:56.208
If I can trust you.

23:56.625 --> 24:01.083
[clock bongs, "Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!"]

24:01.166 --> 24:02.083
[Lemony]  As you know,

24:02.166 --> 24:05.625
the noise made by the clock
in the lobby of the Hotel Denouement

24:05.708 --> 24:07.250
sounded a lot like a word.

24:07.333 --> 24:09.500
This word described Klaus Baudelaire

24:09.583 --> 24:13.166
as he helped hang a strip of birdpaper
outside the fifth floor.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.791
[clock bongs, "Wrong!]

24:20.791 --> 24:22.791
[bell dings, door opens]

24:33.625 --> 24:36.750
[coughing]

24:37.333 --> 24:40.625
[coughing continues]

24:41.125 --> 24:44.500
That's odd. I could've sworn
I heard someone knock at the door.

24:45.375 --> 24:46.208
Ah!

24:46.875 --> 24:47.875
Oh, there you are.

24:47.958 --> 24:50.916
I rang two minutes ago, which is exactly
the amount of time it takes

24:51.000 --> 24:52.541
to get from the third floor
to the lobby,

24:52.625 --> 24:54.208
so you're neither early nor late.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.375
My, the concierges are short
in this hotel.

24:56.458 --> 24:58.625
[babbling]

24:58.708 --> 25:00.041
I have no idea what you're saying.

25:00.125 --> 25:03.000
So I have a very important meeting
in the restaurant in room 954,

25:03.083 --> 25:06.250
but my secretary,
Jacqueline Scieszka, moved to Winnipeg,

25:06.333 --> 25:09.375
and my other secretary,
whose name I never learned,

25:09.458 --> 25:10.750
quit abruptly this morning.

25:10.833 --> 25:13.208
So, do you have
any secretarial experience?

25:15.500 --> 25:16.958
Excellent! Follow me.

25:18.333 --> 25:20.125
You remind me of a toddler I know.

25:20.208 --> 25:21.875
I mean, obviously you can't be her.

25:21.958 --> 25:26.208
I mean, why would a toddler be working
at a hotel and as a concierge? [laughs]

25:26.291 --> 25:28.375
Oh, I just must be hungry
for a familiar face.

25:29.916 --> 25:32.500
Hello, I'm Larry Your-Waiter.
I hope you're hungry for Indian food.

25:32.583 --> 25:36.125
In room 954, which is the library
catalog number for India and South Asia,

25:36.208 --> 25:38.500
we're proud to serve
a wide variety of Indian dishes.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.958
The culinary history of the region
is quite fascinating.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.250
I'll just have a glass of milk.

25:42.333 --> 25:45.416
-Don't want to broaden your horizons?
-No, thank you. I'm afraid of foreigners.

25:47.041 --> 25:51.250
One glass of milk coming up,
and something to bite for the little lady.

25:55.791 --> 25:57.875
I swear I've seen that waiter
somewhere before.

25:57.958 --> 25:58.916
It's the oddest thing,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.541
but this hotel is positively packed
with familiar faces.

26:01.625 --> 26:02.958
Ah, you must be J.S.!

26:03.916 --> 26:05.125
Call me Snicket.

26:05.666 --> 26:07.833
Jacques Snicket. We've never met.

26:07.916 --> 26:09.916
Oh, you're most certainly right
we've never met.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.583
I may forget a name,
but I never remember a face.

26:12.666 --> 26:15.416
Well, lookee here. A small child.

26:15.916 --> 26:18.625
As an upstanding, book-reading,
still-living citizen,

26:18.708 --> 26:21.500
I sure love children.
I love 'em so darn much.

26:21.583 --> 26:24.500
It's frankly kind of disturbing
how much I love children.

26:28.333 --> 26:32.333
Which is why I am not going to let you
out of my sight.

26:32.708 --> 26:35.625
This is actually my secretary.
Well, technically, she's a concierge.

26:35.708 --> 26:36.541
Shall we get started?

26:36.625 --> 26:39.000
Did you procure the items I requested?

26:39.083 --> 26:41.708
I said "procure,"
when a perfectly normal word would do,

26:41.791 --> 26:43.500
because I, Jacques Snicket,

26:43.583 --> 26:46.375
am an insufferable know-it-all
who likes to show off.

26:46.458 --> 26:49.208
-I read your telegram.
-Which I signed J.S.

26:49.291 --> 26:51.000
Which you signed J.S., yes.

26:51.083 --> 26:53.750
-Which are definitely my initials.
-Which are certainly your initials.

26:53.833 --> 26:54.666
And as requested,

26:54.750 --> 26:56.875
I gathered everything
I found in the Baudelaire case,

26:56.958 --> 26:59.416
including all the information
that could incriminate Count Olaf.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.541
Super. I'll just take that.

27:00.625 --> 27:02.708
Then I thought I'd be remiss
in my duties as a banker

27:02.791 --> 27:05.833
if I handed an incomplete file.
After all, you requested everything.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.958
So I did some digging,
and do you know what I found?

27:08.041 --> 27:09.041
Uh...

27:09.125 --> 27:09.958
What?

27:10.541 --> 27:11.416
Everything.

27:12.041 --> 27:13.541
I combed through thousands of documents

27:13.625 --> 27:16.416
until I found each bit evidence
that could relate to the Baudelaire case.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.166
How tedious.
Compliment taken.

27:18.250 --> 27:21.458
A bank is a bit like a library, although
we don't approve of people browsing.

27:21.541 --> 27:24.541
And once I gathered it all up,
I came to a shocking discovery.

27:24.625 --> 27:25.833
That you have to get out more?

27:25.916 --> 27:28.083
This file is more than a collection
of esoteric documents

27:28.166 --> 27:30.416
chronicling the unhappy lives
of several children. No!

27:30.500 --> 27:33.333
When taken together, it forms
a complete history of injustice,

27:33.416 --> 27:36.500
as demonstrated by a wicked villain,
his treacherous girlfriend,

27:36.583 --> 27:39.000
and various well-meaning
yet ineffectual authority figures

27:39.083 --> 27:41.875
who help him, intentionally
or unintentionally, along the way.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.041
I even gave it my own title.

27:44.125 --> 27:46.041
I call it,
The Complete History of Injustice

27:46.125 --> 27:48.625
or Odious Lusting After Fortunes.

27:53.125 --> 27:55.583
Mr. Poe, this is a shocking development.

27:55.666 --> 27:59.625
I promise to keep that file safe,
or my name isn't Jacques Snicket,

27:59.708 --> 28:01.958
a pompous dogooder
who is definitely not dead.

28:02.041 --> 28:03.875
This isn't the file.
Beg your pardon?

28:03.958 --> 28:06.125
This is the index.
The file was too big for my briefcase.

28:06.208 --> 28:07.958
It's being delivered tonight
by another client

28:08.041 --> 28:09.333
who requested the same materials.

28:09.416 --> 28:11.625
-You both have the exact same initials.
-J.S.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.625
Larry.

28:14.708 --> 28:16.541
Fancy seeing you here.

28:16.625 --> 28:17.708
I forgot your milk.

28:17.791 --> 28:20.166
-But it's on that tray.
-I'll go get it from the chef.

28:22.375 --> 28:23.250
Odd service.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.666
-Hotel restaurants!
-[chuckles]

28:24.750 --> 28:27.000
So tell me, who is this other J.S.

28:27.083 --> 28:29.458
that seems so interested
in the Baudelaire orphans?

28:29.541 --> 28:32.583
I'm afraid I can't discuss that.
Banker-client confidentiality.

28:32.666 --> 28:35.791
Pretend your life depended on it.

28:36.416 --> 28:37.250
[gulps]

28:38.041 --> 28:40.125
[Larry] Things are worse than we thought.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.541
How soon before J.S. arrives?

28:41.625 --> 28:43.708
The real J.S., not that imposter
in the dining room.

28:43.791 --> 28:46.208
Tonight. And the package
will be arriving as well.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.291
But our enemies are watching the skies.

28:48.375 --> 28:50.916
If they intercept the delivery,
we will all be eating crow.

28:51.291 --> 28:53.208
Crow is tough to eat.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.916
I hope we have enough sugar.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.916
Especially if there are mushrooms
on the menu.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.708
That came from the kitchen.

29:02.791 --> 29:04.500
Where did your secretary go?

29:04.916 --> 29:09.291
Ah, concierge, I need you to come with me
to room 025, the laundry room.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.041
I need you to put this special lock
on the door.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.541
[Poe] They tend to just wander off,

29:17.625 --> 29:19.458
like orphans or cats.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.083
I know how to make a cat stay.

29:23.041 --> 29:24.208
You skin it.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.708
If you see that waiter,
tell him I'm still waiting on that milk.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.666
We'll take the service elevator.

29:34.583 --> 29:38.500
Exactly. Sometimes what seems mysterious
is really part of a larger plan.

29:42.958 --> 29:47.166
Larry, you're done ruining my schemes,
and also my lunch.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.000
You haven't even tried the curry.

29:49.083 --> 29:50.041
It's way too spicy.

29:50.125 --> 29:53.208
Olaf, you lack more than an appreciation
for subcontinental cuisine.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.708
You lack morals and ethics. And back-up!
Where are your associates now?

29:56.791 --> 29:58.958
Where are yours?
Oh, right. I killed them all.

29:59.041 --> 30:01.083
You can wear a fake mustache,
you can rent a tuxedo--

30:01.166 --> 30:02.416
This isn't rented. I stole it.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.375
You'll never be half the man
Jacques Snicket was.

30:04.458 --> 30:06.416
At least I'm not going
to be cooked alive in curry.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.083
Is that a threat?
Did it sound like one?

30:08.166 --> 30:09.375
Yes, it did.
Good. It was.

30:09.458 --> 30:10.291
We'll see about that.

30:10.375 --> 30:13.375
Frank, would you please escort
this villain off the premises?

30:14.958 --> 30:16.416
I think you mean Ernest.

30:20.125 --> 30:21.625
Yippeekiyay.

30:33.166 --> 30:34.958
[Larry] Unhand me, you cretins!

30:35.041 --> 30:36.291
You cads!

30:36.375 --> 30:37.750
You man-handling imposters!

30:37.833 --> 30:39.500
It's an insult! It's an outrage!

30:39.583 --> 30:41.291
This is no way to treat a waiter!

30:45.125 --> 30:47.166
I'm sorry it has to end like this.

30:47.250 --> 30:50.875
Our little  tête-à-têtes  have been fun,
but this rivalry,

30:50.958 --> 30:54.333
like this sauce,
has simmered far too long.

30:54.416 --> 30:56.041
Do you expect me to talk?

30:56.125 --> 30:58.625
No, Larry Your-Waiter.

31:00.833 --> 31:03.000
I expect you to boil.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.833
Great. This was dry-clean only.

31:11.333 --> 31:12.166
[sighs]

31:12.875 --> 31:15.416
It's important to keep this room secure.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.291
Can I trust you, concierge?

31:18.875 --> 31:20.958
[babbling, clock bongs]

31:21.041 --> 31:24.125
[Lemony]  The sound of the clock
in the lobby described Sunny Baudelaire

31:24.208 --> 31:28.375
as she turned the laundry room entrance
into a Vernacularly Fastened Door.

31:29.083 --> 31:31.791
But it also describes the story
of the Baudelaires

31:31.875 --> 31:34.708
because everything they thought they knew
about their lives,

31:34.791 --> 31:37.583
their situation,
and the Hotel Denouement...

31:38.916 --> 31:39.916
was wrong.

31:42.375 --> 31:44.375
-Wrong.
-[clock bell bongs]

31:46.125 --> 31:47.416
-Wrong.
-[clock bell bongs]

31:47.500 --> 31:49.500
[clock ticks]

32:02.708 --> 32:03.875
[Klaus] It's all wrong.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.500
This hotel is full of people we know,
but they can't all be part of V.F.D.

32:07.583 --> 32:09.708
They were all invited by someone
with the initials J.S.,

32:09.791 --> 32:11.916
but they each think
that J.S. is a different person.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.083
Vice Principal Nero said J.S.
is someone that Esmé would know.

32:15.416 --> 32:16.791
Like her husband, Jerome Squalor.

32:16.875 --> 32:19.208
But Jerome Squalor said J.S.
is a woman who wants to help us.

32:19.291 --> 32:21.500
Mr. Poe's secretary
was called Jacqueline Scieszka.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.500
And Babs thinks that J.S.
is a sea captain.

32:23.583 --> 32:26.166
One of Count Olaf's disguises
was Captain Julio Sham.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.041
But Count Olaf is disguised
as Jacques Snicket.

32:28.125 --> 32:29.791
He doesn't know
who the real J.S. is either.

32:29.875 --> 32:32.333
There are other mysteries.
Why is Esmé planning a cocktail party,

32:32.416 --> 32:34.250
and what does Carmelita want
with a harpoon gun?

32:34.333 --> 32:36.416
Did Frank or Ernest give me the birdpaper?

32:36.500 --> 32:38.375
And who told Sunny
to lock the laundry room door?

32:38.458 --> 32:40.041
Why is everyone watching the skies?

32:41.458 --> 32:42.791
Sunny, I don't know what you mean.

32:44.083 --> 32:45.291
I know what she means.

32:46.125 --> 32:49.000
The humorist John Godfrey Saxe
wrote a poem

32:49.083 --> 32:51.208
that was a favorite
of the Baudelaires' father,

32:51.291 --> 32:54.375
who would often torment his children
by reciting it.

32:54.750 --> 32:57.458
In the poem,
six blind men encounter an animal

32:57.541 --> 32:59.333
and are unable to agree
what it looks like.

32:59.416 --> 33:03.916
The first man feels its tall side
and concludes it must be a wall.

33:04.375 --> 33:09.166
The second feels its trunk and decides
it resembles a snake, and so on.

33:09.958 --> 33:13.083
The moral of the poem
is that observing a part of something

33:13.166 --> 33:15.208
is not the same as observing the whole.

33:15.291 --> 33:17.333
But if you share your observations,

33:17.416 --> 33:20.416
you may find that what seems confusing

33:20.500 --> 33:23.000
is really part of a larger plan.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.291
[elephant trumpeting]

33:29.166 --> 33:30.250
Or an elephant.

33:30.916 --> 33:32.541
We've each heard parts of a larger plan.

33:32.625 --> 33:35.000
If we put them all together,
we can see the whole shape.

33:35.083 --> 33:38.375
Larry Your-Waiter said something
about a package being delivered tonight,

33:38.458 --> 33:39.500
and crows.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.750
What if he meant carrier crows,

33:41.833 --> 33:44.750
like the ones Isadora used to send
couplets in the Village of Fowl Devotees?

33:44.833 --> 33:46.666
That would explain
why Esmé's watching the skies

33:46.750 --> 33:49.250
and why Carmelita needs a harpoon gun.
She's gonna shoot it down.

33:49.333 --> 33:51.875
And I bet that's why Frank or Ernest
had you hang that birdpaper.

33:52.541 --> 33:54.291
If a crow was shot at a certain angle,

33:54.375 --> 33:56.291
it would strike the building
at the fifth floor,

33:56.375 --> 33:59.666
and then it would stick to the birdpaper,
then the package would fall to the ground.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.916
Maybe, or maybe not.
Where else could it land?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.833
I saw a laundry vent under the window.

34:03.916 --> 34:06.166
What if the plan
is for the package to fall in there?

34:06.250 --> 34:08.791
It would end up in the--
Laundry room. Sunny locked the door.

34:08.875 --> 34:10.875
If Frank gave her the lock,
then the package is safe.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.791
But if it was Ernest, then it's not.

34:13.333 --> 34:15.791
-We don't even know what the package is.
-Maybe we do.

34:15.875 --> 34:17.625
What are both sides of the schism after?

34:19.416 --> 34:20.833
The sugar bowl.
The sugar bowl.

34:20.916 --> 34:23.000
[squeaking]

34:27.333 --> 34:32.541
Yes, you can take that to room 347,
please. Civil procedures and courts.

34:32.625 --> 34:33.958
[Violet] Justice Strauss!

34:34.541 --> 34:37.791
Baudelaires! Baudelaires!

34:37.875 --> 34:41.250
Oh, my sweet Baudelaires!

34:41.333 --> 34:42.833
Look at you!

34:42.916 --> 34:45.958
Oh, Klaus, you've gotten so tall.

34:46.041 --> 34:48.083
Violet, you're so grown up.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.208
And Sunny...

34:50.291 --> 34:51.666
-[bites]
-[gasps]

34:51.750 --> 34:52.958
I see you're still a biter.

34:53.375 --> 34:54.500
You recognize us.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.458
I care about you children deeply.

34:56.541 --> 34:59.125
I would recognize you anywhere.
What are you doing here?

34:59.208 --> 35:02.208
Well, after that fraud of a wedding,

35:02.291 --> 35:05.041
I couldn't forgive myself
for letting you down,

35:05.458 --> 35:08.000
so I decided to set things right.

35:08.083 --> 35:09.458
I went looking for you.

35:09.541 --> 35:10.750
[bell dinging]

35:11.500 --> 35:13.458
Next stop, Lousy Lane!

35:16.958 --> 35:19.083
Next stop, Lake Lachrymose!

35:19.166 --> 35:20.125
[bell dinging]

35:21.291 --> 35:23.583
Next stop, the burnt remains
of Paltrytville!

35:24.666 --> 35:25.500
Prufrock Prep!

35:27.458 --> 35:28.333
Dark Avenue!

35:29.000 --> 35:31.208
Village of Fowl Devotees!

35:32.250 --> 35:33.666
Next stop, the hinterlands!

35:33.750 --> 35:35.750
The burnt remains of Heimlich Hospital!

35:35.833 --> 35:39.833
The burnt remains of Caligari Carnival,
and the Mortmain Mountains!

35:39.916 --> 35:41.000
[bell dinging]

35:41.625 --> 35:43.625
[brakes squealing]

35:46.875 --> 35:49.083
But everywhere I went,
you were already gone.

35:49.166 --> 35:50.416
Then how did you find us?

35:50.500 --> 35:53.791
I had some help
from a very strange book.

35:54.625 --> 35:57.500
The book told me
about a secret organization

35:57.583 --> 36:00.250
that was devoted
to fighting the fires of the world.

36:00.333 --> 36:01.250
[Violet]  V.F.D.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.166
Exactly.

36:02.250 --> 36:04.416
They were trying to help you, too.
So what did you do?

36:04.500 --> 36:06.625
Well, I think we should sit down
for this part.

36:10.083 --> 36:12.791
I realized finding you wouldn't be enough,

36:12.875 --> 36:15.000
not if Count Olaf was still at large.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.708
But if I could gather V.F.D.,

36:17.791 --> 36:20.625
along with all the witnesses
of Count Olaf's crimes,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.833
then the High Court
could hear the whole story

36:23.916 --> 36:26.125
and we could bring him to justice at last.

36:26.208 --> 36:27.583
You're putting Count Olaf on trial?

36:27.666 --> 36:29.125
That's why you invited everyone here.

36:29.208 --> 36:31.541
You've been helping us this whole time
and we didn't know?

36:31.625 --> 36:32.875
I didn't do it alone.

36:33.416 --> 36:39.291
Jerome Squalor shared personal anecdotes
about injustices in the financial sector.

36:40.041 --> 36:42.000
He's sorry he let you down too.

36:42.958 --> 36:48.625
Jacqueline Scieszka provided invaluable
note-taking and globe-trotting services.

36:49.625 --> 36:54.583
Jacques Snicket may be dead,
but his research lives on.

36:54.916 --> 36:59.041
And, of course, I read all about
the nefarious deeds of Captain Julio Sham.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.791
I sent all my research to a bank
for safekeeping.

37:03.666 --> 37:07.416
And here it is, all collected at last.

37:07.791 --> 37:11.083
The Complete History of Injustice

37:11.166 --> 37:14.458
or Odious Lusting After Fortunes.

37:16.958 --> 37:19.250
We invited Count Olaf here too,

37:19.333 --> 37:21.708
and my sources say he's arrived.

37:21.791 --> 37:25.041
But after Thursday, he'll be behind bars,

37:25.333 --> 37:28.416
and all your troubles
will be over at last.

37:29.833 --> 37:32.583
Well, our troubles won't be over
until we find a home.

37:32.958 --> 37:38.541
Well, my home could use
three lovely, clever, talented children.

37:39.583 --> 37:42.416
That is, if you can forgive me.

37:43.708 --> 37:45.125
We'd love to live with you.

37:45.208 --> 37:46.375
Do you really mean it?

37:46.458 --> 37:47.458
Of course.

37:47.541 --> 37:50.583
Then this night is different
from all other nights

37:50.666 --> 37:53.875
because this story is finally over.

37:53.958 --> 37:56.791
[clock bell bongs, "Wrong! Wrong!"]

37:56.875 --> 38:00.083
[clock bell bongs, "Wrong! Wrong!"]

38:00.166 --> 38:03.291
[clock bell bongs, "Wrong! Wrong!"]

38:03.375 --> 38:06.500
[clock bell bongs, "Wrong! Wrong!"]

38:10.083 --> 38:12.375
It's late. We should get to sleep.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.958
But rest easy, Baudelaires.

38:20.541 --> 38:22.166
We'll be a family soon.

38:24.375 --> 38:27.625
[Lemony]  As the Baudelaires contemplated
a future with Justice Strauss,

38:27.708 --> 38:30.166
they were excited to tell Kit
what they'd learned.

38:30.958 --> 38:33.333
Though they wondered
what could be keeping her.

38:35.916 --> 38:39.000
I can't believe you're alive.
The Daily Punctilio  ran your obituary.

38:39.083 --> 38:42.041
Oh, you can't believe anything you read
in  The Daily Punctilio,

38:42.125 --> 38:43.875
although they did spell my name right.

38:43.958 --> 38:45.291
Where have you been?
On the lam.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.500
It's better to let our enemies think
that I was dead.

38:47.583 --> 38:48.875
What about your siblings?

38:48.958 --> 38:51.166
I read about Jacques in the paper.
That's why I came back.

38:51.250 --> 38:53.541
-I had to see if it was true.
-It isn't just Jacques.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.750
While you've been gone,
we've lost so many good people.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.083
Monty, Josephine, the Quagmires.

38:58.541 --> 39:00.541
And... Beatrice?

39:00.625 --> 39:02.791
Lemony, I'm so sorry.

39:05.416 --> 39:06.791
I've missed so much.

39:08.708 --> 39:11.500
I feel like I'm arriving
in the middle of someone else's story.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.333
It can be your story, too.
Now that you're back, you can help us.

39:14.416 --> 39:17.083
I can't help anyone, Kit.
You were there that night at the opera.

39:17.166 --> 39:19.166
You know that everything that's happened
is my fault.

39:19.250 --> 39:22.041
The world's troubles
aren't the fault of any one person,

39:22.125 --> 39:23.833
but it is your fault if you do nothing.

39:23.916 --> 39:27.375
Come back to the hotel with me.
Join V.F.D. again. Join us.

39:27.458 --> 39:30.583
What can I do?
You're not dead yet. Do something.

39:33.666 --> 39:35.500
I saw you with--
He's a good man.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.375
I'm happy for you.

39:37.458 --> 39:38.833
Four children.

39:38.916 --> 39:40.750
I have missed a lot.
Four?

39:40.833 --> 39:43.541
One on the way. I saw you
with three more at the hotel.

39:45.333 --> 39:48.000
Lemony, those children aren't mine.

39:49.333 --> 39:50.375
They're the Baudelaires.

39:53.291 --> 39:54.250
You mean that they're--

39:54.333 --> 39:55.541
-[popping]
-A signal flare.

39:58.583 --> 40:00.708
[Lemony] Looks like a self-sustaining
hot-air mobile home.

40:00.791 --> 40:03.833
The Quagmire triplets and a flock
of eagles. They're gonna bring it down!

40:03.916 --> 40:05.166
The  Queequeg  is just offshore.

40:05.250 --> 40:07.166
I can take it to rescue them.
Kit...

40:09.166 --> 40:10.083
How can I help?

40:10.500 --> 40:12.916
Do you still have
a valid taxi driver's license?

40:19.333 --> 40:21.625
[clock ticking]

40:22.500 --> 40:23.500
Are you awake?

40:24.333 --> 40:26.083
I can't sleep.
Me neither.

40:26.541 --> 40:28.625
These sofas make terrible beds.

40:28.708 --> 40:30.750
It's not the sofas.
There's something bothering me.

40:30.833 --> 40:31.666
Me too.

40:31.750 --> 40:34.166
We know who J.S. is.
We know the sugar bowl is being delivered,

40:34.250 --> 40:36.750
but we don't know why it's important
or which brother put the lock

40:36.833 --> 40:39.000
-on the laundry room door.
-That's the problem.

40:39.125 --> 40:41.250
You said you were with Frank or Ernest
at three o'clock.

40:41.333 --> 40:43.166
You heard the clock strike three.

40:43.250 --> 40:44.458
[clock bell bongs]

40:44.541 --> 40:46.458
Sunny was with the other brother
at the same time.

40:46.541 --> 40:47.916
[clock bell bongs]

40:48.000 --> 40:50.083
So...?
So I was with one of the brothers too.

40:50.166 --> 40:52.833
All three of us were with Frank or Ernest
at three o'clock exactly.

40:52.916 --> 40:54.375
[clock bell bongs]

40:55.916 --> 40:58.833
I see what you mean. Two brothers can be
in two places at the same time.

40:58.916 --> 41:00.291
They can't be in three places.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.583
I wish this hotel was a library.

41:02.666 --> 41:05.000
We could use the library catalog
system to find some answers.

41:05.083 --> 41:07.458
Is there a library catalog number
for mysteries?

41:07.791 --> 41:09.416
135. I already thought of that.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.291
But there is no room 135.

41:25.833 --> 41:27.125
Maybe it's not a room.

41:31.791 --> 41:33.833
[Violet]
Remember when we stayed at that hotel

41:33.916 --> 41:36.833
and we thought it would be fun to press
a bunch of buttons at the same time?

41:36.916 --> 41:39.416
Father said when you do that,
you never know where you'll end up.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.708
Let's see where we end up.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.708
-[Klaus] We're going down.
-[Violet] The basement laundry room.

41:44.791 --> 41:46.166
[Klaus] The elevator isn't stopping.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.041
There must be a sub-basement.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.833
[Klaus]
It looks like a library card catalog.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.125
Someone's been repairing a book.

42:01.208 --> 42:03.625
[Klaus] The paste is still wet.
[Violet] The tea is still hot.

42:03.708 --> 42:04.958
[man] Kit, is that you?

42:12.083 --> 42:13.000
You're not Kit.

42:13.666 --> 42:15.875
And you're not Frank.
And you're not Ernest, either.

42:16.500 --> 42:18.250
Because the Denouement brothers
aren't twins.

42:18.333 --> 42:19.208
They're triplets.

42:19.291 --> 42:20.958
Kit told me that you were clever.

42:21.416 --> 42:24.333
My name is Dewey Denouement.
I'm pleased to meet you.

42:24.416 --> 42:27.375
Why didn't Kit tell us about you?
My existence is secret,

42:27.458 --> 42:30.208
which suits me fine
because my work is secret, too.

42:30.291 --> 42:33.625
You see, the Hotel Denouement
is not just organized like a library.

42:40.083 --> 42:41.458
It  is  a library.

42:54.541 --> 42:57.250
We collect reports from every
V.F.D. agent, scholar, researcher,

42:57.333 --> 42:59.958
inventor, scientist, explorer,
cartographer, poet, journalist,

43:00.041 --> 43:03.875
naturalist, herpetologist, optometrist,
receptionist, chef, waiter, taxi driver,

43:03.958 --> 43:08.000
sea captain, film director, ballerina,
children's book author, and mountaineer.

43:08.625 --> 43:10.625
Our volunteers are everywhere,
observing the world

43:10.708 --> 43:12.416
and writing it all down in books.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.708
These books then pass through
a number of safe places,

43:14.791 --> 43:17.416
from hospitals to carnivals,
to end up here...

43:18.166 --> 43:19.541
the Last Safe Place.

43:29.541 --> 43:31.541
Ever since the schism,
it's more important than ever

43:31.625 --> 43:33.875
to keep our research
cataloged and secure.

43:34.250 --> 43:36.250
So while Frank and Ernest run the hotel,

43:36.333 --> 43:37.791
I do my work in the shadows.

43:38.416 --> 43:39.958
Here we are.
Where's the library?

43:40.041 --> 43:41.625
[Dewey] Look below the surface.

43:41.708 --> 43:44.416
-It's a sub-library, so it's submerged.
-It's under the pond.

43:44.500 --> 43:47.708
Our enemies could burn the hotel
to the ground and our work would be safe.

43:47.791 --> 43:48.791
It's a secret library.

43:50.041 --> 43:51.458
Then why are you telling us?

43:52.291 --> 43:55.666
After Thursday, Kit and I are leaving
V.F.D. to raise our child.

43:56.208 --> 43:59.125
The Last Safe Place
will need a new sub-librarian,

43:59.208 --> 44:00.500
or three of them.

44:01.375 --> 44:04.708
You want to give us your library?
I've read all about you, Baudelaires.

44:04.791 --> 44:07.875
Violet, you've invented amazing things
under incredible pressure.

44:07.958 --> 44:11.500
Imagine what you could do with the time
and resources that you'd have here.

44:11.583 --> 44:16.208
Klaus, your research skills are on par
with V.F.D.'s greatest librarians.

44:16.291 --> 44:18.750
Why not use them in service
of its greatest library?

44:19.500 --> 44:22.625
And Sunny, I've heard wonderful things
about your cooking.

44:23.083 --> 44:26.416
Never underestimate the way
that a good meal can change the world.

44:27.666 --> 44:30.125
After Thursday,
Count Olaf will be behind bars.

44:30.208 --> 44:32.083
You'll need a new home. Why not here?

44:32.625 --> 44:34.541
Justice Strauss wants us to live with her.

44:34.625 --> 44:36.375
She promised to keep us safe.

44:36.458 --> 44:37.625
And I'm sure she would.

44:38.166 --> 44:39.791
But you're not children anymore.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.833
Is a safe life really enough?

44:44.208 --> 44:46.875
Before we answer,
there's one secret we want to know.

44:49.875 --> 44:51.166
What's in the sugar bowl?

44:52.208 --> 44:53.041
Ah!

44:53.125 --> 44:54.500
An interesting question.

44:55.791 --> 44:57.250
I searched the hotel for you orphans,

44:57.333 --> 45:00.125
which wasn't easy
because it's very poorly organized,

45:00.208 --> 45:01.791
but you're in my clutches at last.

45:01.875 --> 45:04.208
It's not poorly organized.
It's arranged like a library catalog.

45:04.291 --> 45:06.791
We're not in your clutches.
We're standing at the edge of a pond.

45:06.875 --> 45:08.541
That's what you think.

45:08.625 --> 45:11.500
I'm afraid the man next to you
is one of my associates.

45:11.583 --> 45:13.208
Hand them over, Ernest.

45:13.291 --> 45:14.375
Oh, I'm not Ernest.

45:15.166 --> 45:17.416
Well, then, hand them over, Frank.

45:17.500 --> 45:20.458
You might want to consider doing your hair
different so I can tell you apart.

45:20.541 --> 45:21.958
I'm not Frank either.

45:22.041 --> 45:23.916
What, what? Well, you can't be Dewey.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.541
He's a myth,
like unicorns or Giuseppe Verdi.

45:26.625 --> 45:28.708
Giuseppe Verdi is real.
He's an Italian composer.

45:28.791 --> 45:32.125
You're outnumbered, Olaf. This hotel
is full of volunteers who arrived early,

45:32.208 --> 45:33.458
as noble people do,

45:33.541 --> 45:36.291
while your accomplices,
being wicked, will arrive late.

45:36.958 --> 45:39.250
[Esmé] Of course we will.
Being early is "out."

45:39.333 --> 45:41.041
That's why they call it fashionably late.

45:41.125 --> 45:43.791
Who wants to see me
hit a cakesniffer with a harpoon?

45:43.875 --> 45:46.458
Don't wave that around, child.
It's dangerous.

45:46.541 --> 45:47.791
But I need to practice.

45:47.875 --> 45:50.208
If I hit a crow,
you promised to teach me how to spit

45:50.291 --> 45:52.875
like a real ballplaying cowboy
superhero soldier pirate!

45:52.958 --> 45:54.583
Esmé Squalor and Carmelita Spats.

45:54.666 --> 45:57.250
My library is full of accounts
of your treachery.

45:57.333 --> 45:59.875
Library? I'm beginning to think
you  are  Giuseppi Verdi.

45:59.958 --> 46:01.583
You mean Dewey Denouement.

46:03.333 --> 46:04.833
Dewey Denouement?

46:04.916 --> 46:08.125
Like the unicorn? How exquisite.

46:08.625 --> 46:11.000
I do hope you're coming
to my cocktail party.

46:11.083 --> 46:12.791
We're serving mushrooms.

46:12.875 --> 46:14.125
She means the Medusoid Mycelium.

46:14.208 --> 46:16.500
That's their plan,
to poison everybody at the party!

46:16.916 --> 46:18.416
With V.F.D. out of the way,

46:18.500 --> 46:20.416
I'll be able to steal
the Baudelaire fortune

46:20.500 --> 46:22.041
and anything else I feel like taking.

46:22.125 --> 46:24.791
You would never unleash the Mycelium.
Not without the sugar bowl.

46:24.875 --> 46:26.583
[Esmé] Funny you should mention that.

46:26.666 --> 46:27.625
Once we shoot that crow,

46:27.708 --> 46:29.791
we'll retrieve the sugar bowl
from the laundry room.

46:29.875 --> 46:34.333
Only problem is some pesky volunteer
put a V.F.D. lock on the door.

46:34.416 --> 46:35.791
You're a capable woman, Esmé.

46:35.875 --> 46:38.500
You could be doing so much more
than playing second fiddle

46:38.583 --> 46:42.875
in the last chair in the back row
of a thirdrate orchestra for Count Olaf.

46:44.166 --> 46:45.541
I'm second to nobody.

46:46.458 --> 46:49.791
Now, if you're really Dewey Denouement,
you know all about the sugar bowl.

46:49.875 --> 46:51.916
You know what's inside
and how important it is,

46:52.000 --> 46:53.583
and you know that it is mine.

46:53.666 --> 46:55.583
The container is yours,
not what it contains.

46:55.666 --> 46:57.541
Beatrice stole it from me!

46:57.625 --> 46:59.541
There are worse things in this world
than theft.

46:59.625 --> 47:00.833
[Olaf] There certainly are.

47:00.916 --> 47:04.416
Give us the codes to the lock,
or this little girl will harpoon you.

47:04.500 --> 47:07.208
I'm not shooting any harpoons
until Countie teaches me to spit!

47:08.291 --> 47:12.250
You will do as I say. I already
bought you that ridiculous outfit.

47:12.333 --> 47:13.166
Teach me to spit!

47:13.250 --> 47:14.250
[growls]

47:14.333 --> 47:15.666
Teach me to spit!

47:15.750 --> 47:16.916
Shoot the harpoon!

47:17.000 --> 47:17.875
Teach me to spit!

47:17.958 --> 47:20.458
Shoot the harpoon!
Teach me to spit!

47:20.541 --> 47:24.916
I will never teach you to spit
as long as I can breathe!

47:25.791 --> 47:26.625
Ha!

47:30.166 --> 47:32.291
You apologize to our darling little girl!

47:32.375 --> 47:35.791
She is not a darling little girl.
She is a spoiled brat!

47:35.875 --> 47:38.541
I am tired of pretending to be a family,

47:38.625 --> 47:43.083
and I am tired of a girlfriend
who undermines my authority!

47:43.166 --> 47:46.000
You would have our fortune
if it weren't for Esmé.

47:46.083 --> 47:46.958
You stay out of this!

47:47.041 --> 47:49.166
If it wasn't for her,
you'd be rich and we'd be dead.

47:49.250 --> 47:51.458
Yeah, those brats have a point.
I  would  be rich.

47:51.541 --> 47:52.500
They  would  be dead.

47:52.583 --> 47:54.708
You've never cared about me, Esmé.

47:54.791 --> 47:57.125
All you care about is the sugar bowl,

47:57.208 --> 48:00.708
free acting lessons,
and what's "in" and what is "out"!

48:00.791 --> 48:02.583
Oh, I'll tell you
what's "in" and what's "out."

48:02.666 --> 48:04.125
Being constantly unappreciated

48:04.208 --> 48:06.791
by a man whose pant leg
doesn't even cover his ankle.

48:06.875 --> 48:08.500
"Out!" Being stuck playing second-banana

48:08.583 --> 48:11.583
in a series of increasingly ludicrous
schemes in increasingly remote locations.

48:11.666 --> 48:13.875
Extremely "out"!

48:13.958 --> 48:15.625
I think you're gonna love this one,
darling.

48:15.708 --> 48:17.791
Losing time and again to three children.

48:17.875 --> 48:20.125
Look at them. They're not even old enough
to rent a tuxedo,

48:20.208 --> 48:22.500
and yet, they beat you every time!

48:22.583 --> 48:24.958
That is the "outtest" thing of all!

48:27.291 --> 48:28.208
Esmé...

48:28.958 --> 48:30.166
you're fired.

48:30.250 --> 48:31.291
[scoffs]

48:31.375 --> 48:32.958
And I'm breaking up with you.

48:33.041 --> 48:34.458
You can't break up with me.

48:34.833 --> 48:37.375
No one has ever done that before.

48:37.458 --> 48:39.416
That's what makes it so satisfying.

48:42.916 --> 48:43.750
You...

48:47.375 --> 48:49.083
really want me out of your life?

48:51.041 --> 48:55.458
To... ta... lly.

48:59.375 --> 49:02.208
[frog croaking]

49:02.791 --> 49:07.750
You haven't heard the last
of Esmé Gigi Genivive Squalor.

49:07.833 --> 49:08.958
Come on, darling.

49:09.041 --> 49:11.583
Is Countie not my daddy anymore?
He's not mine either, pet.

49:11.666 --> 49:13.916
Baudelaires...
Going somewhere?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.125
Olaf, put the gun down.
You've lost your associates.

49:16.208 --> 49:17.625
I never needed them anyway.

49:17.708 --> 49:19.708
All I need is the Baudelaire fortune

49:19.791 --> 49:22.416
and the three phrases
to open the V.F.D. lock.

49:22.500 --> 49:25.833
Even if you open it, you'll find nothing
in the laundry room except laundry.

49:25.916 --> 49:26.875
The lock is a decoy.

49:26.958 --> 49:27.791
[snorts]

49:27.875 --> 49:30.208
I may have a handsome and youthful glow,

49:30.291 --> 49:31.916
but I wasn't born yesterday.

49:32.416 --> 49:35.083
I'll give you until the count of ten.

49:35.541 --> 49:36.708
One...

49:37.916 --> 49:39.208
-Two...
-If you want to shoot him,

49:39.291 --> 49:41.708
-you'll have to shoot me!
-I can live with that. Three...

49:41.791 --> 49:42.875
You'll have to shoot me too.

49:42.958 --> 49:45.166
You're sweetening the pot. Four!
Baudelaires...

49:45.250 --> 49:47.291
If he shoots us,
he'll never get the Baudelaire fortune.

49:47.375 --> 49:50.041
There's still the baby. Five!

49:55.958 --> 49:58.875
You have a choice. You can choose
not to pull that trigger.

49:58.958 --> 50:01.875
Yes, and you can choose
death by harpoon. Six!

50:03.833 --> 50:04.750
Seven!

50:08.375 --> 50:09.208
Eight!

50:15.416 --> 50:16.458
Uh...

50:16.541 --> 50:17.375
nine.

50:17.458 --> 50:19.333
You don't have to do this.

50:21.333 --> 50:22.166
[sighs]

50:24.250 --> 50:25.916
It's all I know how to do.

50:31.166 --> 50:32.000
[coughing]

50:32.083 --> 50:33.708
What's going on out here?

50:42.166 --> 50:43.375
[gasps]

50:43.458 --> 50:44.958
Good God, that man's been shot!

50:45.041 --> 50:48.000
[Lemony]  There is an opera called
La Forza del Destino

50:48.083 --> 50:50.333
written by a composer
named Giuseppe Verdi.

50:50.416 --> 50:55.458
"La forza del destino"  is an Italian
phrase meaning "the force of destiny,"

50:55.541 --> 50:59.791
and destiny is a word which tends to cause
arguments among the people who use it.

50:59.875 --> 51:03.666
Some people think that destiny
is something that you cannot escape,

51:03.750 --> 51:06.000
like death or curdled cheesecake.

51:06.083 --> 51:09.125
Other people think
that destiny is an invisible force

51:09.208 --> 51:11.458
that guides people through their lives,

51:11.541 --> 51:15.958
as if they are simply characters
in an opera.

51:21.333 --> 51:24.125
In the opera  La Forza del Destino,

51:24.208 --> 51:26.333
the characters argue, fall in love,

51:26.416 --> 51:29.291
run away to monasteries, engage in duels,

51:29.375 --> 51:31.125
and drop a gun on the floor,

51:31.583 --> 51:34.208
where it accidentally goes off
and kills someone.

51:36.625 --> 51:38.208
The opera is a tragedy,

51:38.291 --> 51:40.875
and so is the story of the Baudelaires,

51:40.958 --> 51:44.250
who were about to experience
a similar incident.

51:44.625 --> 51:46.750
I said, good God, that man's been shot!

51:46.833 --> 51:48.125
[panting]

51:52.458 --> 51:53.291
Kit...

51:53.375 --> 51:54.500
Dewey!
Dewey!

52:04.375 --> 52:07.041
The consequences
would ripple through their lives...

52:07.583 --> 52:08.958
like water in a pond.

52:17.666 --> 52:18.500
What do we do?

52:18.583 --> 52:20.666
Baudelaires, you just shot that man
with a harpoon gun,

52:20.750 --> 52:23.250
along with that other man
who I didn't get a really good look at.

52:23.333 --> 52:25.875
You're going to wait right here
until I get the manager.

52:26.500 --> 52:28.000
That  was  the manager.

52:28.708 --> 52:29.958
[man] Hey, what's going on?

52:30.041 --> 52:32.541
-[boy] What was that racket?
-[man] What's going on down there?

52:33.333 --> 52:34.291
The sugar bowl.

52:34.375 --> 52:36.625
[birds cawing]

52:39.458 --> 52:40.291
Kit...

52:46.708 --> 52:50.333
Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire.

52:53.166 --> 52:54.791
My name is Lemony Snicket.

53:06.208 --> 53:08.583
[theme music playing]
