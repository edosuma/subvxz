00:56.034 --> 00:59.474
<i>The heat wave continues.
It's 109 degrees in Los Angeles.</i>

01:42.635 --> 01:46.074
As drought-ridden Los Angeles
swelters in agonising heat,

01:46.154 --> 01:48.395
drug lords wage warfare in the streets.

01:48.474 --> 01:52.114
Yet another open conflict...
Oh, fuck this! Get me out of here!

02:01.194 --> 02:06.314
We're in a war zone, Dave: two motorcycle
officers horribly wounded in a crossfire,

02:06.394 --> 02:11.114
the police seemingly unable to rescue them
in spite of several desperate, heroic attempts.

02:11.194 --> 02:14.074
It's completely out of control down here.

02:20.194 --> 02:23.874
My beautiful cantina, everything
I own, they shot it to pieces.

02:23.954 --> 02:27.234
My microwave,
my automatic steamer, my grill...

02:27.314 --> 02:29.354
<i>You fucking pendejos!</i>

03:02.394 --> 03:03.514
Fuck you!

03:06.234 --> 03:07.834
<i>Tony Pope, live with Hard Core,
on the scene and in your face.</i>

03:09.995 --> 03:11.634
It's like Dante's hell:

03:11.754 --> 03:13.794
Smoke, fire, oppressive heat,

03:13.874 --> 03:19.514
as Colombian and Jamaican drug fiends
again transform LA into a slaughterhouse.

03:19.754 --> 03:23.274
Who the hell's in charge down here?
The cops? Uh-uh.

03:23.354 --> 03:26.195
They're outmanned,
outgunned and incompetent.

03:26.274 --> 03:29.114
Mr Mayor,
on vacation in your home in Lake Tahoe,

03:29.195 --> 03:32.394
get off your butt, get down
here and declare martial law!

03:57.754 --> 03:59.914
OK, don't keep me in suspense, Danny boy!

03:59.994 --> 04:02.194
It has not been a nice day!

04:02.274 --> 04:06.834
Two motors pulled over a truck, stumbled
right in the middle of a narc stakeout.

04:06.915 --> 04:10.954
You know, ten Colombians
and Scorpios armed to fuck all.

04:11.035 --> 04:13.354
They're trying to get
in their headquarters.

04:13.434 --> 04:17.154
We're keeping them pinned down,
but those officers are bleeding to death.

04:17.274 --> 04:19.914
Fuck! They're dying, man.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.194
Where the hell
is Special Weapons?

04:23.274 --> 04:27.034
They're still tied up in that shootout
in San Pedro with the Jamaicans.

04:27.114 --> 04:28.714
They shot down a chopper.

04:28.794 --> 04:32.954
Mills and Johnson won't last much longer.
We need an assault vehicle to go get 'em.

04:33.034 --> 04:35.114
I'm gonna chat with these assholes.

04:35.194 --> 04:38.234
- When I give the signal, give me some cover!
- Got it!

04:54.834 --> 04:56.834
Too small.

04:57.514 --> 04:58.554
Right.

05:32.594 --> 05:34.155
Come on! Come on!

05:34.514 --> 05:36.954
Get 'em out of here! Now!

05:43.954 --> 05:45.394
<i>!Vámonos!</i>

05:46.594 --> 05:48.314
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

06:05.794 --> 06:07.794
<i>- !Vámonos!
- !Vámonos!</i>

06:29.554 --> 06:31.314
Hey, assholes!

06:50.954 --> 06:52.714
Mike, are you OK?

06:52.914 --> 06:56.354
- Yeah. Let's get the rest.
- We can't. Orders from Chief Heinemann.

06:56.434 --> 06:58.795
He says surround building and wait.

06:58.874 --> 07:00.715
- Wait for what?
- I don't know!

07:00.794 --> 07:04.114
Some bullshit special unit.
The feds, the DEA.

07:04.194 --> 07:07.594
If we let those bastards get dug in now,
we'll have to level the building!

07:08.514 --> 07:11.955
<i>- Hijo de puta.
- No, es para mi.</i>

07:12.034 --> 07:13.514
<i>!Vámonos!Vámonos!</i>

07:13.595 --> 07:15.394
<i>!Venga!Aprisa!</i>

07:15.514 --> 07:17.315
<i>!Venga!</i>

07:18.514 --> 07:20.394
<i>!Chingale!Chingale!</i>

07:26.714 --> 07:30.714
Come and get it. El Scorpio is ready.

07:42.955 --> 07:45.434
- Sarge, any of your people in the building?
- No.

07:45.514 --> 07:46.954
Let's go.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.914
Lieutenant, can't let you in.
Heinemann's on his way.

07:49.994 --> 07:52.394
Heinemann can kiss my sweet ass! Come on!

07:53.434 --> 07:55.354
Goddamn it. Go with him.

08:19.754 --> 08:22.114
Three, two, one...

08:22.194 --> 08:23.794
Go!

08:30.794 --> 08:32.794
Get back.

08:36.354 --> 08:38.354
Next door over.

08:54.754 --> 08:56.475
Take this room!

09:00.595 --> 09:02.794
First floor, officer down. We need backup.

09:21.634 --> 09:23.394
Freeze!

09:23.474 --> 09:25.114
I said hold it!

09:25.194 --> 09:29.194
Now, lay your guns down.
You can walk down or fly, it's your choice.

09:29.994 --> 09:31.834
I said put it down, asshole!

09:34.714 --> 09:36.795
No!

09:59.514 --> 10:03.074
- Let's do it now!
- Take it easy.

10:07.395 --> 10:08.834
Damn, it's hot.

10:33.794 --> 10:35.554
Must be losing it.

10:37.435 --> 10:39.154
<i>Mike!</i>

10:39.234 --> 10:41.714
<i>Spread out. Secure the roof.</i>

10:41.794 --> 10:44.674
<i>Just take it easy. I'm right here.</i>

10:45.554 --> 10:47.794
All clear. All clear on the site.

10:48.034 --> 10:50.114
<i>Oh, Danny boy.</i>

10:50.834 --> 10:52.594
I gotta get down from here.

10:55.034 --> 10:56.994
Shit.

10:57.074 --> 11:00.994
OK, search the roof.
Check every floor. Maybe someone else...

11:01.074 --> 11:03.554
Seal it off. No one leaves.

11:03.634 --> 11:06.074
Danny, get me off this damn roof.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.274
<i>- You get the rest of them?
- Somebody beat us to it.</i>

11:22.754 --> 11:24.314
Leona.

11:37.794 --> 11:39.714
Oh, shit.

12:00.874 --> 12:03.914
- What happened to El Scorpio?
- He's out front having lunch.

12:03.994 --> 12:05.914
What the hell is this?

12:05.994 --> 12:07.594
I don't know.

12:07.674 --> 12:09.554
They've been cut to pieces.

12:09.634 --> 12:13.674
- Must be the Jamaicans.
- Their style, but where the hell did they go?

12:13.754 --> 12:18.074
OK, nobody gets in here
until Forensic arrives. Nobody.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.674
OK, you know the drill.

12:47.274 --> 12:48.555
Mike.

12:49.274 --> 12:51.274
Up there.

12:57.074 --> 13:01.634
He must have been killed out here,
and then someone...

13:03.194 --> 13:07.634
That's about 35, 40 feet.
No rope, no ladder.

13:07.714 --> 13:11.114
The guy weighs about 190, 195 pounds.

13:11.194 --> 13:12.994
<i>You couldn't carry him up there.</i>

13:14.314 --> 13:16.034
Lieutenant?

13:16.114 --> 13:20.034
Deputy Chief Heinemann's downstairs.
He wants you out of the building now.

13:20.114 --> 13:22.034
Son of a bitch.

13:23.074 --> 13:25.194
What the fuck is going on?

13:25.274 --> 13:28.074
This is not good, Mike. Not good at all.

13:32.154 --> 13:35.234
- I want a real name on this joker, OK?
- You got it.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.914
Mike.

13:38.154 --> 13:42.034
<i>Phil, this is quite a surprise.
What brings you down from the palace?</i>

13:42.474 --> 13:46.034
You let me down, Mike.
You're making me look bad.

13:46.874 --> 13:49.194
I thought we had an understanding.

13:49.274 --> 13:51.554
I put my ass on the line to get you here,

13:51.634 --> 13:54.234
and all I expect is a little cooperation!

13:56.234 --> 13:58.354
You were told this was a federal matter.

13:58.434 --> 14:00.994
Yet you disobeyed an order
to stay out of the building.

14:01.074 --> 14:04.275
Don't let this get out, Phil,
but it's a fucking war down here.

14:04.834 --> 14:07.554
<i>Soldiers take orders. Don't push it!</i>

14:07.634 --> 14:11.234
<i>I'll push it as far as I can, Phil,
cos we're fighting for our lives here,</i>

14:11.314 --> 14:14.835
<i>while you're downtown
pushing pencils and kissing ass!</i>

14:17.394 --> 14:20.114
I don't roll over for anybody,
especially the feds,

14:20.194 --> 14:22.394
without a goddamn good explanation!

14:44.914 --> 14:48.435
Take this equipment up to the third floor.
Come on, let's move!

14:59.955 --> 15:01.994
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, sir!

15:02.074 --> 15:04.594
What the hell is going on here, Heinemann?

15:04.674 --> 15:09.074
Insubordination. Disregard for direct orders
from a supervising officer.

15:09.154 --> 15:11.434
Now get back to your cage at Alvarado.

15:11.514 --> 15:15.114
- I'll show you insubordination, you son of...
- No!

15:15.194 --> 15:16.955
Where you running to? Come here!

15:17.034 --> 15:19.754
You don't need this, Mike.
It's not worth it.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.554
Relax.

15:21.635 --> 15:23.354
Oh, fuck!

15:42.554 --> 15:44.314
<i>I have an update for you.</i>

15:44.395 --> 15:47.634
<i>In a shootout, five members
of one Colombian drug gang</i>

15:47.714 --> 15:51.794
<i>were ambushed by their bloody rivals,
the Jamaican Voodoo Posse,</i>

15:51.874 --> 15:56.074
<i>who escaped without a trace -
again making total fools of...</i>

15:56.154 --> 15:58.795
- A detective is here to see you.
- Back there.

15:58.874 --> 16:03.154
Listen, lady, you got a backed-up toilet.
Call a plumber, not the cops.

16:03.234 --> 16:08.034
- This licence has expired.
- Bullshit! I paid that fee six months ago.

16:08.114 --> 16:10.875
- I'll kick your ass!
- Sit down! Right now!

16:10.954 --> 16:14.114
- Move! Get your ass movin'!
- Just calm the fuck down!

16:16.794 --> 16:18.714
What you lookin' at?

16:20.594 --> 16:22.354
And all you got to do

16:22.434 --> 16:25.314
is tee it high and let it fly.

16:27.114 --> 16:28.714
Dead solid perfect.

16:28.794 --> 16:33.394
Now, remember, for distance
you gotta gently but firmly grip the club.

16:33.754 --> 16:36.795
Lieutenant Harrigan!
Detective Lambert, Rampart Division.

16:36.874 --> 16:39.794
Hey, kid, just have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

16:40.154 --> 16:41.954
- Hey, Cap.
- Don't start, Mike.

16:42.034 --> 16:45.834
Heinemann's already been up my ass so far
I won't be able to sit down for a week.

16:45.914 --> 16:47.674
We're not winning this war.

16:47.755 --> 16:50.594
As much as it'll piss you off,
you'll have to play the game.

16:50.954 --> 16:55.634
"Effective immediately, a federal task force
under Special Agent Peter Keyes

16:55.714 --> 17:02.194
will investigate criminal activities involving
the trafficking of controlled substances. "

17:02.274 --> 17:05.315
<i>And you will extend him
your full cooperation.</i>

17:05.394 --> 17:08.314
So you're cutting off my dick
and shoving it up my ass.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.434
The feds are calling the shots on this.
My hands are tied!

17:12.035 --> 17:15.273
- Yeah?
- Captain Pilgrim, Peter Keyes.

17:16.273 --> 17:18.594
- It's good to meet you.
- And you, sir.

17:18.674 --> 17:22.074
Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.
Special Agent Peter Keyes, DEA.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.795
Heard a lot about you.

17:24.874 --> 17:27.993
I'm sorry for this jurisdictional intrusion.

17:28.074 --> 17:30.954
Don't mean to be stepping on your toes.

17:31.034 --> 17:36.034
But we want to prevent King Willie's voodoo
gangs from taking over the entire West Coast.

17:37.835 --> 17:39.875
I wish I could tell you more.

17:39.954 --> 17:43.394
But we have a large number
of deep-cover operatives involved.

17:43.874 --> 17:47.474
You know how it is. We all have a job to do.

17:47.954 --> 17:52.635
Now, I'm sure we can respect
each other's situation and act responsibly.

17:53.394 --> 17:54.954
Well,

17:55.034 --> 17:57.155
cooperation

17:58.554 --> 18:00.474
is my middle name.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.794
I'll see you around.

18:15.194 --> 18:19.554
- I'm the new transfer, Jerry Lambert.
- Like I said, have a seat. I'll be right with you.

18:19.634 --> 18:22.194
- Who is this dude?
- Yeah, what an asshole.

18:24.794 --> 18:26.674
All right, Danny boy, what we got?

18:26.754 --> 18:30.514
What have we got? Five lowlife Scorpions
make it into the building.

18:30.594 --> 18:33.394
The next minute they're all shish kebab.

18:33.474 --> 18:35.114
Not one bullet wound.

18:35.194 --> 18:37.755
It wasn't drugs or money.
There's a shitload of that.

18:37.834 --> 18:42.034
Maybe King Willie brought in some
outside talent. He's making his big move.

18:42.114 --> 18:44.314
A pro would have split
the moment he heard us.

18:44.394 --> 18:46.474
More than one, we would have seen them.

18:46.555 --> 18:49.674
Whoever did this
waited until the last minute,

18:49.754 --> 18:53.754
and then took out four men
armed with machine guns by hand!

18:53.834 --> 18:56.034
And then got by us.

18:56.114 --> 18:59.274
Maybe we should give him a job.
Let's put him on the payroll.

18:59.674 --> 19:03.154
So me and my partner bolt up the stairs,
somebody is screaming bloody murder...

19:03.234 --> 19:05.634
- You gotta hear this.
- What?!

19:05.714 --> 19:08.114
Hey, I forgot to tell you.

19:08.194 --> 19:09.834
See that guy there?

19:09.914 --> 19:11.834
That's Ferris's replacement.

19:13.234 --> 19:16.995
This guy's Jerry Lambert.
The Lone Ranger from Rampart station.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.794
That's the Lone Ranger?

19:18.874 --> 19:21.674
I thought he was here
to fix the air conditioning.

19:21.754 --> 19:24.914
I said "Lady, you are under arrest. "
And she said "Why?"

19:24.994 --> 19:28.194
I said "Because your husband is dead.
You killed him. "

19:28.754 --> 19:31.194
- Know what she said, didn't miss a beat?
- No.

19:31.274 --> 19:35.795
She said "I stabbed that son of a bitch
plenty of times. He never died on me before. "

19:39.274 --> 19:43.434
Looks like he's putting the moves to Leona.

19:43.514 --> 19:45.234
His first big mistake.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.354
I have heard about you.

19:50.434 --> 19:52.115
Yeah?

19:52.194 --> 19:55.395
- Like your last partner got shot.
- What?

19:55.474 --> 19:56.514
Well...

19:57.794 --> 20:02.034
You try that cowboy shit with me, fucker,
you can kiss these goodbye.

20:02.675 --> 20:05.074
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

20:05.154 --> 20:09.074
Well, well, I see that
the three of you have met.

20:09.914 --> 20:12.834
Lambert, if you're feeling up to it,

20:12.914 --> 20:17.474
why don't you limp your way in
to the lieutenant. He wants to talk to you.

20:20.474 --> 20:22.835
- You're a bad girl.
- I like that.

20:24.274 --> 20:27.714
Goddamn, is that bitch on the rag or what?

20:31.234 --> 20:36.835
This is what I call "the speech", kid.
I only give it once, so pay attention.

20:36.914 --> 20:42.074
Until now, it's all been fun and games,
cops and robbers, dunking doughnuts.

20:42.914 --> 20:46.314
But you're in the shit now.
Metro Command is a war zone.

20:46.394 --> 20:48.234
Lieutenant, I've paid my dues.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.674
I had to bust my ass to get my transfer.

20:50.754 --> 20:52.914
And that scares the shit out of me, kid.

20:52.994 --> 20:55.554
<i>No one requests to come here
unless they want a reputation.</i>

20:55.634 --> 21:00.275
There's no room for anyone looking
to prove themselves. I won't stand for it.

21:00.354 --> 21:05.074
Don't get me wrong. We need good cops,
and they say you're good at what you do.

21:05.154 --> 21:07.354
But the team comes first.

21:07.434 --> 21:11.274
You live by that, and you'll be OK.
And we'll all be there for you.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.954
Remember, the door swings both ways.

21:14.394 --> 21:16.314
That's it.

21:21.675 --> 21:23.714
Hey, kid.

21:24.275 --> 21:26.034
Welcome to the war.

21:51.754 --> 21:54.954
OK, guys. This has gone too far now, huh?

21:56.474 --> 21:58.394
Hey, guys.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.794
I know you're trying to scare me, huh?

22:03.194 --> 22:06.714
Well, you did a pretty good job, man.

22:06.795 --> 22:08.714
I'm scared now.

22:09.834 --> 22:11.434
Stop it now.

22:11.754 --> 22:13.434
I can pay you.

22:13.515 --> 22:16.275
$2 million, man. In cash.

22:16.354 --> 22:19.114
- Right now!
- This is not about money.

22:19.754 --> 22:22.314
This is about power!

22:23.154 --> 22:25.274
There's a new king in the streets.

22:25.354 --> 22:28.594
This is a message he has for your people.

22:28.674 --> 22:30.594
You are history.

22:30.675 --> 22:33.474
<i>Fucking history, goddamn puto.</i>

22:42.594 --> 22:45.075
What the fuck are you doing now, man?

22:45.154 --> 22:47.074
You're crazy!

22:47.434 --> 22:49.354
King Willie says

22:50.314 --> 22:52.314
not only do I have to kill you,

22:56.914 --> 22:59.954
but I have to take your soul.

23:03.834 --> 23:06.034
Voodoo magic.

23:06.114 --> 23:08.594
Fucking voodoo magic, man.

23:13.274 --> 23:15.594
But you know what?
I tell you what I believe.

23:19.235 --> 23:21.155
Shit happens.

23:35.754 --> 23:37.514
Shoot it!

24:07.554 --> 24:09.034
Fucker!

24:31.834 --> 24:34.274
<i>Shit happens.</i>

24:47.434 --> 24:51.194
I'm standing just outside
a penthouse complex in San Pedro...

24:51.274 --> 24:54.394
<i>.. involving as many as 20 people.
It's uncertain who they were.</i>

24:54.474 --> 24:57.994
One report indicates it might be
the feared Jamaican Voodoo Posse.

24:58.074 --> 25:03.074
I go in for my physical and the doctor says
"I need a semen, stool and urine sample. "

25:03.154 --> 25:07.035
I say "Gee, doc, I'm in a big hurry.
Can I just leave my underwear?"

25:07.114 --> 25:08.754
Oh, God.

25:11.274 --> 25:14.754
Word is there may be as many as
50 more dead bodies up there.

25:14.834 --> 25:16.474
Oh, man, it's Pope.

25:16.554 --> 25:18.514
That parasite must live in his car.

25:18.594 --> 25:20.834
I'll handle it. PR's my specialty.

25:21.314 --> 25:23.554
Word is they want your ass off the job.

25:23.635 --> 25:25.474
- Tony!
- Who the hell are you?

25:25.555 --> 25:28.155
Your biggest fan!
Catch your show all the time.

25:28.234 --> 25:31.314
- I got a job to do!
- Your job is to root for garbage elsewhere.

25:31.394 --> 25:34.475
- Been inside?
- Yeah. We were gonna go in with our guys,

25:34.554 --> 25:38.754
but we were told on a radio transmission
nobody goes in under any circumstances.

25:38.834 --> 25:43.954
<i>All units, be advised.
Federal officers will handle investigation.</i>

25:44.034 --> 25:46.955
- We didn't hear that. Let's go.
- You're the boss.

25:47.034 --> 25:49.434
This is Cheryl Tyer reporting live...

25:50.274 --> 25:52.754
Hey, nice flashlight. Mind if I borrow it?

26:00.914 --> 26:02.554
OK.

26:11.754 --> 26:13.354
Damn!

26:15.994 --> 26:17.314
Look familiar?

26:19.434 --> 26:20.914
Fuck.

26:20.994 --> 26:23.194
Oh, God.

26:24.395 --> 26:26.714
Ramon Vega, the crack king.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.314
Biggest operator in East LA.
100 keys a week.

26:29.394 --> 26:34.275
- Why isn't he skinned? And who are they?
- Jamaicans. King Willie's boys.

26:34.354 --> 26:35.954
That makes no sense.

26:36.034 --> 26:39.674
This was a voodoo ritual. I've seen it
before. They took his heart out.

26:39.755 --> 26:41.994
- What for?
- Terror tactics, man.

26:42.074 --> 26:44.954
You know,
to scare the shit out of their enemies.

26:45.554 --> 26:48.194
- King Willie.
- Who the hell is King Willie?

26:48.274 --> 26:52.515
King Willie, voodoo priest of the LA posses.

26:52.594 --> 26:55.634
Ran the terror gangs
for Edward Seaga in Jamaica

26:55.714 --> 26:57.634
till he got too powerful.

26:57.714 --> 27:00.634
The Jamaican chiefs
won't make a move without his approval.

27:00.714 --> 27:02.594
So what the fuck happened?

27:02.674 --> 27:04.274
Shit!

27:06.274 --> 27:08.194
Hey, we got a survivor!

27:16.674 --> 27:18.594
What's she saying?

27:19.114 --> 27:21.714
I don't know. She's not making any sense.

27:21.794 --> 27:26.154
<i>She keeps saying "El diablo vino
por ellos. " The devil came for them.</i>

27:26.234 --> 27:31.514
If it's the Colombians, why'd they leave their
boss hanging and his girl naked on the floor?

27:31.594 --> 27:34.394
- It wasn't the Colombians.
- Our friend from the armoury.

27:34.474 --> 27:36.514
Right.

27:36.594 --> 27:38.514
We got a new player in town.

27:39.714 --> 27:41.954
Come over here, Mike. Check this out.

27:46.194 --> 27:47.914
What is that?

27:48.354 --> 27:51.755
Looks like a spear tip or something.

27:52.274 --> 27:54.274
This is a restricted area.

27:54.354 --> 27:56.594
I want it cleared immediately.

27:56.674 --> 27:58.594
You're walking on physical evidence.

27:59.474 --> 28:01.515
- We'll take care of her.
- She's with me.

28:01.594 --> 28:04.994
Lieutenant, I'd like
a word with you in private, please.

28:09.794 --> 28:13.074
They say that persistence
is your most outstanding quality.

28:13.155 --> 28:15.915
- I know this is your show...
- You're not listening to me!

28:16.154 --> 28:19.394
You got a big nose and
you're sticking it too far in my business.

28:19.474 --> 28:22.355
Maybe you can hear this.
The next time you cross me,

28:22.434 --> 28:25.234
you're gonna turn up missing.

28:25.834 --> 28:29.314
- Garber, the man with the camera. Get him.
- Yes, sir.

28:30.634 --> 28:32.635
- All right. Let's go.
- Stay away.

28:32.714 --> 28:36.034
- Hey, fuck you, man! Give me my camera!
- Shut the fuck up.

28:36.114 --> 28:39.034
Hey, wait a minute!
I got my rights! I'm a journalist.

28:39.114 --> 28:42.034
- Harrigan!
- Shut up. Let's go.

28:42.354 --> 28:45.554
Smells like a cover-up.
The press has a right to know!

28:45.634 --> 28:48.034
Take him out of the building. Search him.

28:49.515 --> 28:51.715
Now you get the hell out of here.

28:53.755 --> 28:55.354
Who the hell are you, Keyes?

28:55.434 --> 28:58.754
The last person in the world
you wanna fuck with.

29:12.394 --> 29:14.114
Wanna make me proud, kid?

29:14.194 --> 29:17.674
Take your bag of tricks, stay with them,
find out where they take her.

29:17.755 --> 29:21.434
Meet me later at La Cita's.
And be careful. These guys are good.

29:21.514 --> 29:24.314
Hey, don't worry!
Surveillance is my specialty.

29:24.394 --> 29:26.834
OK, then. Just get going.

29:29.234 --> 29:31.234
Go get 'em, Lone Ranger.

29:32.035 --> 29:35.034
Danny, look here.
We gotta take this real cool.

29:35.114 --> 29:38.834
These guys sure aren't the DEA,
but it's still Keyes's party.

29:38.914 --> 29:42.434
You stick around, stay out of sight.
I'll meet you at one o'clock.

29:42.514 --> 29:46.834
We'll take a good look at that room, OK?
Hey, wait for me.

29:47.395 --> 29:49.914
<i>Danny boy, no hero stuff, understand?</i>

29:55.354 --> 29:57.434
Watch your ass, Danny boy.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.394
She never made it.

30:06.714 --> 30:08.474
The feds were waiting.

30:08.874 --> 30:10.794
Hustled her off in a chopper.

30:11.794 --> 30:14.754
- Let me guess. A silver Alouette?
- That very one.

30:17.474 --> 30:21.314
And guess what. Your pal Keyes was
running the whole show. And his butt boys.

30:21.794 --> 30:23.634
Son of a bitch.

30:23.714 --> 30:25.594
You done real good, kid.

30:26.394 --> 30:28.874
Now tomorrow, start a tail on Keyes.

30:28.955 --> 30:31.275
Everything he does, everywhere he goes.

30:31.354 --> 30:33.274
Who knows? You might just get lucky.

30:33.954 --> 30:35.354
Lieutenant!

30:35.434 --> 30:36.915
Luck

30:36.994 --> 30:38.914
is my specialty.

30:40.114 --> 30:42.234
Yeah. I bet it is.

30:47.714 --> 30:52.474
Now, if you'll excuse me, Lieutenant,
I got some serious police work to attend to.

30:52.914 --> 30:54.834
Come to Papa.

30:56.994 --> 30:59.554
- Hey, are your balls OK?
- Fine.

30:59.634 --> 31:01.514
How are yours?

31:01.595 --> 31:03.994
- Hey, do you mind? It's my sister.
- Say what?

31:04.075 --> 31:05.794
<i>Oh, you're not my sister.</i>

31:08.314 --> 31:12.474
Son of a bitch.
Who are you really chasing, Keyes?

31:13.434 --> 31:15.434
Time to go to work.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.074
<i>- Shit.
- Danny boy.</i>

34:38.674 --> 34:40.514
Mike?

34:46.434 --> 34:47.914
Oh, God!

34:56.034 --> 34:58.634
Oh, Mother of God!

35:09.834 --> 35:12.434
<i>Lieutenant Michael R Harrigan:</i>

35:12.514 --> 35:15.954
<i>violence prone,
obsessive/compulsive personality,</i>

35:16.034 --> 35:18.754
<i>a history of excessive physical force</i>

35:18.834 --> 35:23.554
<i>throughout his 18 years
as a Los Angeles police officer.</i>

35:23.634 --> 35:28.915
<i>Also responsible for the destruction of
11 patrol cars, a city bus...</i>

35:28.994 --> 35:31.154
What about ten commendations for valour

35:31.234 --> 35:35.634
and the best felony arrest record
in the history of this department?

35:35.714 --> 35:40.794
That and my intervention on your behalf
are the only reasons you still have a job.

35:40.874 --> 35:46.274
If it were up to the chief, he'd charge you with
Detective Archuleta's death and suspend you.

35:49.074 --> 35:51.034
As it is, he left it in my hands.

35:52.154 --> 35:57.195
Now, this John Wayne attitude and flagrant
disregard for policy is gonna end now.

35:57.714 --> 36:01.514
No one under my command will impede
the progress of this federal task force

36:01.594 --> 36:03.514
headed by Agent Keyes.

36:03.915 --> 36:05.834
No one.

36:11.595 --> 36:13.554
That's it.

36:13.635 --> 36:15.554
Dismissed.

36:21.794 --> 36:25.474
Mike, you're too close to this.
Stay out of it.

36:25.554 --> 36:28.595
It's a police matter.
They can't keep the department out of it.

36:28.674 --> 36:30.874
We'll find Danny's killer.

36:30.954 --> 36:33.675
Captain, Danny and I came up together.

36:33.754 --> 36:35.834
15 years on the fucking street!

36:36.314 --> 36:39.554
Whoever killed him's gonna pay.
I'm gonna finish it.

36:51.874 --> 36:53.794
Hey, come on. What is this?

36:59.514 --> 37:01.515
Listen, shithead.

37:01.594 --> 37:05.994
I don't give a fuck what you want with
this asshole because now it's personal.

37:06.074 --> 37:07.634
And he's a dead man.

37:07.714 --> 37:10.794
What you're dealing with
is over your head. I'm warning you...

37:10.874 --> 37:13.834
<i>You! You don't know
what you're dealing with.</i>

37:13.914 --> 37:16.674
<i>And I'm warning you.
Stay the fuck out of my way!</i>

37:28.834 --> 37:31.034
- I'll take care of him.
- No.

37:31.914 --> 37:33.994
Let him go.

37:34.074 --> 37:36.194
We're too close.

37:40.754 --> 37:45.034
<i>...claiming as his, turf controlled
by the Jamaican and Colombian drug lords.</i>

37:45.114 --> 37:47.594
<i>Watch as we continue our report.</i>

37:48.474 --> 37:51.155
<i>Yes, the word is out: LA is up for grabs,</i>

37:51.234 --> 37:54.154
<i>the spoils of our once fine city
going to the ruthless scum</i>

37:54.234 --> 37:57.674
<i>who can spread the most
carnage and blood in our streets.</i>

37:57.754 --> 37:59.754
<i>The latest update on the scoreboard:</i>

37:59.834 --> 38:02.555
<i>five assorted trash and one good cop,</i>

38:02.634 --> 38:04.354
<i>one of the best on our force.</i>

38:04.434 --> 38:07.394
<i>Who's next? Where's the mayor?
He's not even in the city...</i>

38:07.474 --> 38:09.395
Forget it. It's over.

38:10.235 --> 38:14.154
Mike, goddamn it. This ain't your
personal little war, you know.

38:14.234 --> 38:15.874
I loved Danny, too.

38:16.114 --> 38:19.675
Hey, you told me the only way
you survive is because you're a team.

38:19.754 --> 38:22.114
The door swings both ways. Remember?

38:27.834 --> 38:29.914
All right. We'll do it together.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.474
Come on. Talk to me about Keyes.

38:33.794 --> 38:37.834
- We've been on him for the last three days.
- And they're not looking for drug dealers.

38:37.914 --> 38:41.394
Yeah. They've been setting up
weird radar sensors all over downtown.

38:41.474 --> 38:43.914
I used my whole repertory
to keep up with them!

38:44.354 --> 38:47.354
I had scanners on them,
but they scrambled my shit up.

38:47.434 --> 38:49.554
They had equipment I can't begin to touch.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.714
And then this morning

38:52.354 --> 38:54.834
<i>- I lost 'em.
- We lost them.</i>

38:54.914 --> 38:56.914
- Where?
- Vernon and Industry.

38:56.994 --> 38:59.834
- They disappeared!
- The slaughterhouse district?

38:59.914 --> 39:03.154
Yeah, and in this heat...
I mean, BO and barbecue!

39:03.234 --> 39:06.234
Whatever Keyes is looking for,
he's found it, or close to it.

39:06.514 --> 39:08.515
Leona, I want to meet with King Willie.

39:08.594 --> 39:11.074
Willie and I seem to have the same problem.

39:11.754 --> 39:14.874
- In the meantime, you come with me.
- Mike, it's impossible!

39:14.954 --> 39:16.874
Just do it.

39:18.714 --> 39:20.554
Fuck!

39:21.794 --> 39:24.114
<i>Omega 1. This is Control.</i>

39:24.194 --> 39:25.955
<i>This is Omega 1.</i>

39:26.314 --> 39:29.434
We only have 22 minutes
on safe window of operation.

39:29.515 --> 39:33.114
- Yes, sir.
- Verify that final telemetry check.

39:33.194 --> 39:34.914
Start your test now.

39:34.994 --> 39:37.554
Scan track three, two, one,

39:37.634 --> 39:38.714
mark.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.474
Number six, power up on the UV banks.

39:42.474 --> 39:46.354
We're complete on the lower UV banks.
Ready for testing.

39:46.434 --> 39:49.234
Second level,
check for ambient temperature variations.

39:49.314 --> 39:51.354
You got two minutes. Now get going.

39:53.234 --> 39:57.834
<i>To all units. All units, you have
approximately 20 minutes to finish your task.</i>

39:58.034 --> 40:00.034
<i>- Roger.
- Increase this UV.</i>

40:00.114 --> 40:02.034
<i>Up 42 per cent.</i>

40:05.114 --> 40:08.794
Your friend died as the result of
an intrusion in the chest cavity

40:08.875 --> 40:12.354
by an edged weapon
that nearly cleaved the heart in two.

40:12.435 --> 40:14.434
Death was instantaneous.

40:14.514 --> 40:18.594
He was boned like a fish.
I've never seen anything like this.

40:19.394 --> 40:21.314
Please, do not touch anything.

40:25.194 --> 40:27.914
Doctor, what about the other victims?

40:28.394 --> 40:29.794
Anything there?

40:29.875 --> 40:32.714
The federal team brought in
their own forensic examiners.

40:32.794 --> 40:36.314
I am the medical examiner
and the chief pathologist in the city,

40:36.394 --> 40:38.034
and they've cut me out.

40:38.114 --> 40:41.354
Any way you can get a look at evidence
the feds have collected?

40:41.434 --> 40:45.354
- I mean, they must have run tests.
- It won't be easy.

40:45.434 --> 40:47.434
Doctor,

40:47.514 --> 40:51.034
I pried this from Danny's hands.
This is what took him into the rafters.

40:51.114 --> 40:54.674
- It has almost no weight.
- But it cuts like steel.

40:54.754 --> 40:56.474
Let me see.

40:58.635 --> 41:03.475
We are now at 150,000 times
normal magnification.

41:08.955 --> 41:14.234
Astonishing. This material doesn't
correspond to anything on the periodic table.

41:14.314 --> 41:18.514
- Lieutenant, what the hell is that thing?
- Don't know. It's not from a hardware store.

41:18.594 --> 41:20.634
- Military?
- Good guess.

41:20.714 --> 41:23.394
Either something that got away,
or something they want.

41:23.474 --> 41:26.474
Keyes. Ah, we're getting closer now
to what happened...

41:27.714 --> 41:29.314
Hey, no!

41:29.395 --> 41:31.435
Easy, kid. Put your gun away.

41:31.514 --> 41:33.434
King Willie will see you now.

41:38.634 --> 41:40.594
- It's OK.
- Don't you want me with you?

41:40.674 --> 41:42.435
I'll call you later.

41:42.514 --> 41:46.034
- You want me to follow you?
- I'll call you later!

41:49.275 --> 41:51.314
You want some ganja, man?

41:53.234 --> 41:54.474
License plate number.

41:54.554 --> 41:55.994
1-8-8...

41:56.074 --> 41:57.754
No, no. 1-8-8-3...

41:57.834 --> 41:59.754
Oh, fuck!

42:08.634 --> 42:10.994
<i>The door swings both ways, my ass.</i>

42:11.354 --> 42:13.394
<i>This door swings both ways.</i>

42:29.714 --> 42:31.634
Thanks for the ride.

42:32.594 --> 42:33.914
You know,

42:34.314 --> 42:36.554
you guys really ought to cut down.

43:17.754 --> 43:21.754
They say you want to talk to me.

43:21.834 --> 43:26.314
They say you offering me favours.

43:29.555 --> 43:31.914
Tell me why, Babylon.

43:31.994 --> 43:34.194
Mr Policeman.

43:34.794 --> 43:38.634
- I want some information.
- Information.

43:41.195 --> 43:44.474
About the one that's doing all the killing?

43:44.554 --> 43:46.514
He killed your people.

43:46.594 --> 43:48.514
Now mine.

43:49.554 --> 43:51.274
I think you know who he is.

43:52.794 --> 43:54.434
I want him.

43:55.354 --> 43:58.394
<i>I don't know who he is.</i>

43:59.315 --> 44:02.514
<i>But I know where he is.</i>

44:03.754 --> 44:06.954
- The other side.
- What are you talking about?

44:07.034 --> 44:08.674
The spirit world, man.

44:09.914 --> 44:11.674
You see,

44:11.754 --> 44:13.674
it's always the same.

44:15.434 --> 44:18.314
There's no stopping what can't be stopped.

44:18.394 --> 44:21.034
No killing what can't be killed.

44:21.114 --> 44:23.154
Make sense, man.

44:23.234 --> 44:26.954
This thing
that's killing your people and mine

44:27.034 --> 44:29.034
is from the other side.

44:29.114 --> 44:31.914
I can feel him all around.

44:31.994 --> 44:35.314
You can't see the eyes of the demon

44:36.434 --> 44:39.154
until him come calling.

44:40.394 --> 44:42.754
This is dread, man.

44:42.834 --> 44:44.754
Truly dread.

44:51.794 --> 44:54.554
Nothing else for you here, policeman.

44:54.634 --> 44:56.554
Time to go.

45:09.275 --> 45:11.114
Prepare yourself.

46:15.154 --> 46:17.874
"His foundation lie in the holy mountain. "

46:18.234 --> 46:19.514
"Selah. "

47:08.474 --> 47:10.834
<i>This is Tony Pope live from LA,</i>

47:10.915 --> 47:12.155
<i>the city of fear.</i>

47:12.234 --> 47:15.074
<i>The psycho-vigilante killer
continues his daily diet for murder.</i>

47:15.954 --> 47:17.554
<i>Bodies strung out,</i>

47:17.634 --> 47:21.394
<i>bodies with the skins ripped off,
the hearts torn from the cadavers.</i>

47:21.474 --> 47:24.154
<i>And just recently,
King Willie, the drug lord,</i>

47:24.235 --> 47:27.514
<i>the vicious drug lord found in
an alley just around the corner</i>

47:27.594 --> 47:31.434
<i>with his head cut off and his
spinal column torn from the body.</i>

47:31.514 --> 47:34.194
<i>A fitting demise
to the Prince of Powder.</i>

47:37.955 --> 47:41.274
<i>First Danny, then King Willie.
And you were right there!</i>

47:41.674 --> 47:44.594
<i>He's playing with you, Mike.
You've gotta be careful.</i>

47:44.834 --> 47:47.314
Yeah. We all gotta be careful.
What about Keyes?

47:47.594 --> 47:51.554
<i>- Anything there?
- Definitely something slippery about Keyes.</i>

47:51.634 --> 47:53.994
Seems there's a Peter J Keyes.

47:54.074 --> 47:56.634
PhD physical sciences, Cornell.

47:57.114 --> 48:00.834
<i>Hot out of college
and into the Strategic Defense Institute.</i>

48:00.914 --> 48:04.874
Then two years later commissioned
as a captain in Air Force Intelligence.

48:04.954 --> 48:07.554
Mike, this is a dead end.
We're way out of our league!

48:07.634 --> 48:12.154
Look, I don't care who's involved. This
guy killed Danny and he's going to fall!

48:13.354 --> 48:16.394
<i>- What about the good doctor?
- I'm here, Lieutenant.</i>

48:16.474 --> 48:20.834
The federal authorities erased everything
from the computer file except for this:

48:20.914 --> 48:25.394
part of a chemical test
on a fragment of wood from the penthouse.

48:25.474 --> 48:27.194
And it contained traces

48:27.274 --> 48:31.234
<i>of cattle blood and
heavy traces of steroids.</i>

48:31.315 --> 48:36.914
I believe whoever killed Detective Archuleta
had recently been in a slaughterhouse.

48:36.994 --> 48:39.434
<i>That's where I lost Keyes the first time!</i>

48:39.514 --> 48:41.394
That's where we'll find him.

48:41.474 --> 48:44.834
Take the metro. I'll pick you up
at Vernon station in an hour.

48:44.914 --> 48:48.474
<i>Just because you don't see Keyes's boys
doesn't mean they're not around.</i>

49:08.794 --> 49:11.034
I just want you to stay in the car. OK?

49:11.114 --> 49:14.994
Your mom and I won't be very long. You
sit still. We'll be back in a few minutes.

49:15.074 --> 49:16.994
All right?

49:17.514 --> 49:19.674
- Come on, honey.
- Yes, darling.

49:19.754 --> 49:21.674
- Which way was it?
- Down here.

49:27.114 --> 49:29.154
Take that, you scum-sucking dog.

49:52.074 --> 49:53.994
Want some candy?

49:56.114 --> 49:58.275
Brian?

49:58.354 --> 50:01.034
- You come here right this minute!
- Mommy, I saw a ghost.

50:01.114 --> 50:04.034
<i>Want some candy?</i>

50:22.034 --> 50:23.954
Rest.

50:28.914 --> 50:30.674
<i>Want some candy?</i>

51:27.675 --> 51:29.594
Danny's necklace.

51:32.114 --> 51:34.194
I hate the subway at rush hour.

51:34.794 --> 51:39.674
It's hard enough to find a seat, and if you do,
someone's pissed in it or thrown up over it.

51:39.754 --> 51:42.274
This damn heat is killing me, man.

51:42.635 --> 51:44.194
Hey, it's me!

51:44.274 --> 51:46.674
- I look great!
- Oh, shut up.

51:46.754 --> 51:48.194
No autographs, Pop.

51:48.275 --> 51:51.155
- Look. There's two seats right there.
- Don't touch me!

51:51.234 --> 51:53.554
Hey! Get off!

51:55.474 --> 51:57.234
This shit never ends.

52:00.274 --> 52:01.954
- After you.
- Asshole!

52:02.034 --> 52:04.914
- Excuse me. Police business.
- Get out of my way!

52:05.954 --> 52:09.354
<i>Hey, baby. Bésame mucho. Come on!</i>

52:12.395 --> 52:14.314
You look like a sympathetic dude.

52:14.714 --> 52:17.514
My... partner here needs an operation.

52:17.594 --> 52:20.874
But we're a little short of cash,
if you know what I mean?

52:21.394 --> 52:23.154
No need for that.

52:24.154 --> 52:25.514
Money!

52:25.593 --> 52:28.274
Get the hell away from me!
I know how to use this!

52:28.354 --> 52:32.234
- Don't make me use this thing!
- Bet mine's bigger than yours!

52:32.314 --> 52:33.714
I'll take that.

52:35.954 --> 52:38.514
- Hold it. Police!
- We're in trouble now.

52:38.594 --> 52:40.954
<i>- Nobody move!
- !Alto, policia, no se muevan!</i>

52:41.034 --> 52:44.114
Everybody take a deep breath,
loosen your sphincters.

52:44.474 --> 52:46.834
We don't need any rush-hour Rambos there.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.674
<i>Tú también, motherfucking baby!</i>

52:48.755 --> 52:50.874
<i>Drop it and sit down!Siéntate!</i>

52:53.114 --> 52:55.034
What the hell is that?

53:00.395 --> 53:02.195
Leona, you OK?

53:02.554 --> 53:06.514
This is it! He's in the train!
Get these people out of here!

53:08.994 --> 53:10.914
Jerry!

53:11.314 --> 53:13.314
What's happening?

53:33.514 --> 53:35.434
Get down!

53:36.074 --> 53:37.754
Get out of the way!

53:37.834 --> 53:39.714
Jerry!

53:39.795 --> 53:41.594
Leona!

53:41.674 --> 53:44.434
Leona, get 'em out! Go!

53:48.234 --> 53:50.154
Now!

54:11.914 --> 54:13.834
Jerry!

54:14.194 --> 54:16.194
Leona, do it!

54:16.274 --> 54:18.195
Now!

54:37.834 --> 54:39.754
Hey! Over here!

54:40.514 --> 54:43.155
Yeah, that's right. Come and get it.

54:48.194 --> 54:50.114
Come on! Move it!

54:50.634 --> 54:51.794
<i>Let's go!Vamos!</i>

54:59.674 --> 55:04.074
<i>Move it! Don't panic, just go! Go! Vamos!</i>

55:15.154 --> 55:17.315
Jesus Christ. What the fuck are you?

55:18.914 --> 55:20.554
Wait!

55:28.314 --> 55:30.954
<i>!Vamos! Come on!</i>

55:37.195 --> 55:39.834
<i>Keep walking! Come on, you too!Vámonos!</i>

55:40.554 --> 55:42.354
Come on, motherfucker!

55:42.434 --> 55:44.394
<i>Want some candy?</i>

55:44.594 --> 55:46.354
Let's dance!

55:51.114 --> 55:53.034
Come on, get out of the way!

56:12.995 --> 56:14.915
Come on, out!

56:15.754 --> 56:17.915
Come on, move it!

56:17.994 --> 56:21.754
That way! Towards the light!

56:21.834 --> 56:23.754
Come on! Get out!

57:22.874 --> 57:24.794
Oh, God.

57:32.994 --> 57:34.914
Jerry.

58:03.074 --> 58:04.994
God, not again.

58:05.914 --> 58:07.994
Move your ass! Move out the way!

58:09.794 --> 58:13.314
- Watch out! What's happening?
- It's a fucking slaughter, Lieutenant.

58:17.474 --> 58:18.834
Hey, Jerry!

58:19.195 --> 58:21.274
Leona!

58:21.354 --> 58:23.995
Oh, please. Leona...

58:24.955 --> 58:28.154
- How's she doing?
- Deep shock, but she's alive.

58:30.274 --> 58:32.674
I hear foetal heart sounds. She's pregnant.

58:32.754 --> 58:34.754
Let's move. LA County. Stat!

58:37.754 --> 58:39.355
Stand back.

58:39.434 --> 58:41.874
On three. One, two, three. Load up.

58:41.955 --> 58:45.874
Out of my way! Move out the way! Move it!

58:56.394 --> 58:58.314
Man!

59:02.554 --> 59:05.434
Wait a minute. Let me see.

59:10.834 --> 59:12.914
- Where's Jerry?
- I don't know.

59:13.874 --> 59:15.474
We found his badge.

59:17.514 --> 59:19.395
Who got hit this time?

59:19.474 --> 59:21.274
Five gang members,

59:21.354 --> 59:23.194
bunch of commuters.

59:23.274 --> 59:25.194
Doesn't make sense.

59:25.754 --> 59:27.674
They were all armed.

59:28.514 --> 59:30.754
- What do you mean?
- It's the chief.

59:31.274 --> 59:32.874
Wait here.

59:32.954 --> 59:37.194
<i>- What the hell's going on down there?
- It's a damn nightmare. Civilians this time.</i>

59:37.274 --> 59:39.435
<i>- All killed?
- Yeah. Just like the others.</i>

59:39.514 --> 59:40.914
<i>Damn!</i>

01:00:27.594 --> 01:00:29.594
Jerry!

01:00:49.154 --> 01:00:51.794
Holy shit! What the hell is going on here?

01:00:52.114 --> 01:00:56.594
Hey, guys, get the camera on!
Get the camera on this right now!

01:00:56.674 --> 01:00:58.834
Get that goddamn thing on film!

01:00:59.514 --> 01:01:01.474
What's going on?

01:01:07.674 --> 01:01:09.275
Hey, Harrigan!

01:01:09.354 --> 01:01:11.434
More victims! More mutilations!

01:01:12.234 --> 01:01:14.634
<i>- Fuck you!
- Pope!</i>

01:01:15.074 --> 01:01:17.875
<i>Pope? Are you there, Pope?
Pope, what's going on?</i>

01:03:11.994 --> 01:03:13.794
Sir, the cop is back.

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:15.794
Goddamn.

01:03:18.954 --> 01:03:22.714
Harrigan! Don't you show up
in the damnedest places.

01:03:24.154 --> 01:03:27.554
Come here, Lieutenant.
I got something you might find interesting.

01:03:28.554 --> 01:03:29.874
What is this?

01:03:29.954 --> 01:03:33.834
How many times do I have to tell you?
You don't know what you're dealing with.

01:03:36.314 --> 01:03:38.994
There's your killer. Wonderful, isn't it?

01:03:39.074 --> 01:03:42.354
Pheromone signature left by his body.
Scent molecules.

01:03:42.434 --> 01:03:44.514
Punch up three.

01:03:44.594 --> 01:03:49.594
Ten years ago one of his kind eliminated an
elite Special Forces crew in Central America.

01:03:49.674 --> 01:03:51.434
There were two survivors.

01:03:51.675 --> 01:03:56.274
They indicated that, when trapped, the
creature activated a self-destruct device

01:03:56.354 --> 01:04:00.114
that destroyed enough rainforest
to cover 300 city blocks.

01:04:00.394 --> 01:04:02.474
Remarkable weaponry.

01:04:02.554 --> 01:04:06.314
That's right, Lieutenant.
Other-world life forms.

01:04:07.914 --> 01:04:09.915
A fucking alien!

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:15.594
Iwo Jima, Cambodia, Beirut.
Drawn by heat and conflict.

01:04:15.675 --> 01:04:20.394
He's on safari. Lions.
The tigers. The bears.

01:04:20.475 --> 01:04:21.874
Oh, my!

01:04:22.314 --> 01:04:25.074
Trophies. That's the game, isn't it, Keyes?

01:04:25.154 --> 01:04:27.073
You're the lion.

01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:29.395
This is his jungle.

01:04:29.474 --> 01:04:33.235
- So why can't we see him?
- Defensive adaptations are astounding.

01:04:33.314 --> 01:04:36.314
It's somehow able to bend light.
Perfect camouflage.

01:04:36.394 --> 01:04:39.314
- You admire the son of a bitch.
- Not what he does.

01:04:39.395 --> 01:04:41.114
For what he is.

01:04:41.194 --> 01:04:42.874
For what he can give us.

01:04:42.954 --> 01:04:45.554
A new era of scientific technology.

01:04:45.634 --> 01:04:49.634
I've waited a lifetime for this,
and I'm not going to miss the chance.

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:53.874
We have something
on the pheromone scanners.

01:05:00.474 --> 01:05:05.154
- Target one is on the roof.
- It's taken us two weeks to learn his patterns.

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:07.274
He comes here every two days to feed.

01:05:07.354 --> 01:05:11.354
- Seems he has a taste for beef.
- I didn't think he was vegetarian.

01:05:11.434 --> 01:05:14.034
Well, we've prepared a
trap for this predator.

01:05:14.114 --> 01:05:17.874
We are certain that this being
can see in only one spectrum of light -

01:05:17.954 --> 01:05:20.514
<i>- ... infrared.
- Infrared?</i>

01:05:20.594 --> 01:05:24.434
- He hunts by seeing our heat.
- Block the heat and he's blind.

01:05:24.514 --> 01:05:27.594
These suits insulate body heat,
making the team invisible.

01:05:27.675 --> 01:05:30.074
We've flooded the place
with radioactive dust

01:05:30.155 --> 01:05:33.754
and installed powerful
ultraviolet lighting everywhere.

01:05:33.834 --> 01:05:37.594
<i>The dust adheres to his body,
making him visible.</i>

01:05:37.675 --> 01:05:41.634
Liquid nitrogen. You're not gonna kill him.
You're gonna freeze him.

01:05:41.714 --> 01:05:44.754
- We have to capture him.
- He's moving.

01:05:44.835 --> 01:05:46.594
Finally.

01:05:47.274 --> 01:05:49.434
Grab a seat. Enjoy the show.

01:05:49.514 --> 01:05:51.434
This is history.

01:06:04.914 --> 01:06:07.354
Capture and isolation is our objective.

01:06:07.435 --> 01:06:09.834
Defensive action only on my orders.

01:06:11.274 --> 01:06:13.474
Power up. Lights on. Let's get him!

01:06:27.475 --> 01:06:28.874
We're in.

01:06:28.954 --> 01:06:30.915
Switch to ultraviolet.

01:06:30.994 --> 01:06:35.114
<i>- Radio silence. Out.
- Engage ultraviolet units A through J.</i>

01:06:58.834 --> 01:07:02.634
- What's all this interference?
- Correcting the problem, sir.

01:08:13.314 --> 01:08:15.314
They're moving to the second level.

01:08:15.394 --> 01:08:19.314
Target's still moving,
heading towards the number two stairwell.

01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:22.354
Playing right into it.

01:08:36.674 --> 01:08:38.154
Wait a minute.

01:08:38.354 --> 01:08:40.113
It's stopped.

01:10:05.594 --> 01:10:08.274
It's moving back against the wall.

01:10:08.354 --> 01:10:10.794
It's backing up. It's moving away from them.

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:12.714
Your boys have been made.

01:10:12.794 --> 01:10:17.634
- Sir, it's circling around behind them.
- Get 'em out! They're walking into a trap!

01:10:19.034 --> 01:10:22.315
Keyes, he's behind you.
Third floor structure. Right there!

01:10:22.395 --> 01:10:24.674
<i>Who is this? Clear the line.</i>

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:28.554
He sees the damn lights. Turn 'em off! Shit!

01:10:29.114 --> 01:10:30.554
Stop him!

01:10:37.074 --> 01:10:39.274
- Door. Open it.
- Go fuck yourself.

01:10:40.274 --> 01:10:41.354
OK. OK.

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.155
The door.

01:10:43.234 --> 01:10:45.674
- Yes, sir.
- You don't know what you're doing.

01:10:47.354 --> 01:10:49.435
- It's open.
- You'll ruin everything!

01:10:49.514 --> 01:10:51.274
Fuck yourself!

01:10:52.154 --> 01:10:55.554
Defensive formation one.
Nitrogen guns, safeties off.

01:10:55.634 --> 01:10:57.394
Everyone else, rock'n'roll.

01:10:57.474 --> 01:10:59.394
<i>This is it.</i>

01:11:09.754 --> 01:11:11.514
He's moving down from the right.

01:11:12.154 --> 01:11:14.954
Garber, where is he? I can't see him.

01:11:15.754 --> 01:11:17.514
He's right there!

01:11:17.834 --> 01:11:21.114
Goddamn it! Where is he?
Well, give me a coordinate! Where is he?

01:11:23.914 --> 01:11:26.194
<i>- Watch out!
- My God.</i>

01:11:26.274 --> 01:11:29.115
Watch your crossfire!

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:38.474
I'm losing my pressure.

01:12:04.434 --> 01:12:06.354
Keyes, you all right?

01:12:06.434 --> 01:12:08.475
<i>Keyes, it's over here!</i>

01:12:22.394 --> 01:12:24.394
Come on! Switch over!

01:12:24.475 --> 01:12:26.395
Shit! I can't see!

01:12:30.674 --> 01:12:32.994
They're gone.

01:12:33.435 --> 01:12:35.274
They're all dead.

01:13:24.474 --> 01:13:26.834
<i>You want me? Here I am!</i>

01:17:13.314 --> 01:17:15.234
You are one

01:17:15.794 --> 01:17:17.233
ugly mother...

01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:21.274
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

01:17:58.434 --> 01:18:00.234
Guess who's back.

01:18:02.514 --> 01:18:04.434
Too late to go home now.

01:18:18.554 --> 01:18:21.555
Get out of here, Harrigan.
I'm gonna save your ass.

01:18:21.634 --> 01:18:24.274
This is between me and him!

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:13.234
God...

01:20:07.074 --> 01:20:08.994
Birds.

01:20:09.875 --> 01:20:11.794
Damn birds.

01:21:17.475 --> 01:21:19.396
OK, pussyface.

01:21:20.076 --> 01:21:22.036
It's your move.

01:21:22.116 --> 01:21:24.876
<i>Shit happens.</i>

01:22:59.555 --> 01:23:01.995
Oh, God.

01:23:04.916 --> 01:23:06.835
That's all I need is birds.

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:09.436
You can do it.

01:23:11.836 --> 01:23:14.395
I can do it.

01:23:15.676 --> 01:23:17.596
It's like falling off a log.

01:23:30.036 --> 01:23:32.436
Like a 30-storey log. Damn!

01:23:49.676 --> 01:23:52.275
Maybe I'll get lucky and fall.

01:24:31.956 --> 01:24:33.876
Damn it.

01:24:49.916 --> 01:24:52.396
<i>The final Jeopardy answer is this:</i>

01:24:52.476 --> 01:24:57.196
<i>Berengaria, who never set foot in England,
was its queen for eight years</i>

01:24:57.275 --> 01:25:00.556
<i>after marrying this king on Cyprus.</i>

01:25:00.636 --> 01:25:02.516
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:25:02.956 --> 01:25:04.676
Herb?

01:25:04.755 --> 01:25:07.956
Herb, wake up!
There's somebody in the bathroom.

01:26:30.436 --> 01:26:34.275
- It's all right. I'm a cop.
- I don't think he gives a shit.

01:26:36.795 --> 01:26:38.475
Shit!

01:26:38.556 --> 01:26:40.476
Get back inside!

01:26:47.795 --> 01:26:50.356
Holy Moses. Not again. Shit!

01:26:51.515 --> 01:26:53.436
Son of a bitch.

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:56.195
Oh, God.

01:27:01.116 --> 01:27:03.516
Why can't this guy stay on the ground?

01:27:05.556 --> 01:27:08.156
Come on, come on.

01:27:08.235 --> 01:27:10.236
Come to Papa.

01:27:16.155 --> 01:27:18.955
Stop! Stop the elevator!

01:27:19.516 --> 01:27:21.235
Stop it!

01:27:49.635 --> 01:27:51.555
Now where the hell am I?

01:28:08.276 --> 01:28:10.196
Where are you?

01:29:02.276 --> 01:29:04.476
Jesus Christ.

01:31:12.675 --> 01:31:14.595
That's right, asshole!

01:31:15.515 --> 01:31:17.315
Shit happens!

01:32:55.476 --> 01:32:58.195
OK. Who's next?

01:33:43.275 --> 01:33:45.195
<i>Take it.</i>

01:33:49.355 --> 01:33:51.276
"1715."

01:36:36.876 --> 01:36:40.195
Harrigan!
What the fuck happened in there?

01:36:47.796 --> 01:36:49.956
Goddamn it. We came so close!

01:36:59.115 --> 01:37:03.436
Don't worry, asshole.
You'll get another chance.
