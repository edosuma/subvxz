33:34.240 --> 33:37.069

33:37.079 --> 33:39.170
- I think I tend to dress

33:37.079 --> 33:39.170
more conservatively

33:39.180 --> 33:42.170
because sometimes,

33:39.180 --> 33:42.170

you were Kyle.

34:34.099 --> 34:36.150
So what exactly do you see?

You know Rob Minkoff.

"Haunted Mansion."

35:01.039 --> 35:02.179

36:54.219 --> 36:55.219
- All right, let's eat.

36:55.230 --> 36:57.119
- I need to eat something.

36:57.130 --> 36:59.119
- What did you get?

36:57.130 --> 36:59.119
Did you get us some ribs?

36:59.130 --> 37:01.219
- Hash browns with caviar?

37:01.230 --> 37:03.119
- Okay, now I'm having

37:01.230 --> 37:03.119
a pig in a blanket.

37:03.130 --> 37:04.099
These are so good.

37:04.110 --> 37:06.119
- I thought you said

37:04.110 --> 37:06.119
this was a barbeque.

37:06.130 --> 37:08.059
- Barbeque.

37:06.130 --> 37:08.059
- It's not a barbeque.

37:08.070 --> 37:10.079
- It's not a barbeque, girl.

37:08.070 --> 37:10.079
Ah, sh--.

37:10.090 --> 37:12.260
Truth is none of these women

37:10.090 --> 37:12.260
know how to throw a barbeque.

37:12.269 --> 37:15.039
- Oh, a cheese enchilada

37:12.269 --> 37:15.039
and chili relleno.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.190
- Yeah.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.190
- And rice and beans.

37:16.199 --> 37:17.230
- My intention really is

37:16.199 --> 37:17.230
to have a barbeque.

37:17.239 --> 37:20.059
But then it gets to be a lot.

37:17.239 --> 37:20.059
- It's a lot of work.

37:20.070 --> 37:21.190
- It would be better

37:20.070 --> 37:21.190
if we were, like,

37:21.199 --> 37:23.199
on some yacht in the Med,

37:23.210 --> 37:25.059
but the truth is,

37:23.210 --> 37:25.059
we're at Dorit's house

37:25.070 --> 37:27.219
in Encino, but I'll take it.

37:27.230 --> 37:29.179
- Oh, there's more!

37:27.230 --> 37:29.179
- There we go.

37:29.190 --> 37:31.119
- Yay!

37:29.190 --> 37:31.119
And they're hot ones.

37:31.130 --> 37:33.130
Let's do it.

37:31.130 --> 37:33.130
Come on, so I can get one.

37:33.139 --> 37:34.269
I love a pig in a blanket.

37:34.280 --> 37:37.130
- Don't run away.

37:34.280 --> 37:37.130
- Pigs in a blanket.

37:37.139 --> 37:38.130
- Let's sit down.

37:38.139 --> 37:39.139
- I'm gonna sit over here.

37:39.150 --> 37:41.079
- My feet hurt.

37:41.090 --> 37:43.239
- I've had so many

37:41.090 --> 37:43.239
pigs in a blanket.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.150
- I'll take one of those.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.150
Thank you.

37:45.159 --> 37:47.039
- Can I say one thing, ladies?

37:47.050 --> 37:50.170
I have to say, in this moment,

37:47.050 --> 37:50.170
I feel really great.

37:50.179 --> 37:51.150
- Yes.

37:51.159 --> 37:53.159
- And I haven't had that

37:51.159 --> 37:53.159
in a long time.

37:53.170 --> 37:55.219
I need to get away.

37:53.170 --> 37:55.219
- Yes.

37:55.230 --> 37:57.250
- I wanna invite all of you

37:57.260 --> 37:59.179
on a little trip to Lake Tahoe.

37:59.190 --> 38:01.280
I got a house on Lake Tahoe.

38:01.289 --> 38:03.119
- Yeah.

38:01.289 --> 38:03.119
- It'd be so fun.

38:03.130 --> 38:04.119
You could get away

38:03.130 --> 38:04.119
from the kids.

38:04.130 --> 38:05.119
- I'd love to get away.

38:05.130 --> 38:06.190
My mother just got here, so...

38:06.199 --> 38:08.239
- Okay, good.

38:06.199 --> 38:08.239
- Oh, honey, I'm in.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.079
- And Kathy, you're in.

38:10.090 --> 38:11.190
- Do I bring

38:10.090 --> 38:11.190
my scissors with me

38:11.199 --> 38:12.239
and my dental supplies?

38:12.250 --> 38:14.139
- Oh, my God.

38:12.250 --> 38:14.139
- You must.

38:14.150 --> 38:16.139
[laughter]

38:16.150 --> 38:18.190
- I've always liked

38:16.150 --> 38:18.190
to play games,

38:18.199 --> 38:20.150
and when I was little,

38:20.159 --> 38:22.090
I would gather all the children

38:22.099 --> 38:24.090
in the neighborhood

38:22.099 --> 38:24.090
to come over

38:24.099 --> 38:28.150
and I would do dental work

38:24.099 --> 38:28.150
on them.

38:28.159 --> 38:31.269
You know, Kim and Kyle

38:28.159 --> 38:31.269
would be my little assistants.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.250
And I'd say, "All right.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.250
Walnut pick."

38:33.260 --> 38:36.070
And then Kyle would hand it

38:33.260 --> 38:36.070
to me.

38:36.079 --> 38:37.250
And the kids would be like,

38:37.260 --> 38:38.289
"No, no.

38:37.260 --> 38:38.289
I don't wanna do that.

38:39.000 --> 38:39.250
I'm not"--

38:39.260 --> 38:41.239
If you wanna come back here

38:39.260 --> 38:41.239
and play,

38:41.250 --> 38:44.099
you're gonna let me do this.

38:44.110 --> 38:46.260
So I was a character.

38:46.269 --> 38:49.250
- After those kids went home

38:46.269 --> 38:49.250
to their parents,

38:49.260 --> 38:51.260
we kind of went into hiding.

38:51.269 --> 38:52.289
We were scared.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.070
- Really?

38:54.079 --> 38:55.150
- She's been doing

38:54.079 --> 38:55.150
hair and teeth

38:55.159 --> 38:57.070
really for a very long time.

38:57.079 --> 38:58.079
- Shut up.

38:57.079 --> 38:58.079
- Swear to you.

38:58.090 --> 39:00.059
- She'll file down your teeth

38:58.090 --> 39:00.059
if you need it.

39:00.070 --> 39:01.210
[laughter]

39:01.219 --> 39:03.199
- Wait, I'm gonna get

39:01.219 --> 39:03.199
a bottle of water.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.079
Thank you.

39:05.090 --> 39:07.000
- Oh, my God.

39:05.090 --> 39:07.000
Water's a good idea.

39:07.010 --> 39:08.110
Hi, Mama.

39:07.010 --> 39:08.110
- Water's a great idea.

39:08.119 --> 39:10.110
Hi, baby.

39:08.119 --> 39:10.110
- I'm excited about Tahoe.

39:10.119 --> 39:11.190
I'm excited.

39:10.119 --> 39:11.190
- Good. Me too.

39:11.199 --> 39:12.190
- How do you feel about it?

39:12.199 --> 39:13.260
How is everything

39:12.199 --> 39:13.260
with Garcelle?

39:13.269 --> 39:15.110
Everything's good?

39:15.119 --> 39:16.110
- Well, I had a great dinner

39:16.119 --> 39:17.099
with her the other night.

39:17.110 --> 39:18.260
- Oh, good.

39:17.110 --> 39:18.260
- It was a really good dinner.

39:18.269 --> 39:19.260
- Good.

39:18.269 --> 39:19.260
- Yeah.

39:19.269 --> 39:21.210
I think we'll be okay.

39:21.219 --> 39:23.099
- I did hike with Lisa.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.260
I know that y'all

39:23.110 --> 39:24.260
talked it out.

39:24.269 --> 39:27.079
I just feel like I am open

39:27.090 --> 39:29.260
to growing and figuring it out,

39:29.269 --> 39:31.150
what our relationship

39:29.269 --> 39:31.150
is going to be.

39:31.159 --> 39:35.139
- My understanding

39:31.159 --> 39:35.139
was y'all were

39:35.150 --> 39:37.130
good to go.

39:37.139 --> 39:38.199
- No.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.130
- I think she thinks

39:38.210 --> 39:40.130
y'all are good.

39:40.139 --> 39:42.150
And if you--

39:40.139 --> 39:42.150
- Well then, her bad.

39:43.199 --> 39:45.239
It takes more than one drink

39:45.250 --> 39:49.179
to fix our "friendship."

39:49.190 --> 39:53.000
- If there's dishonesty

39:49.190 --> 39:53.000
in how you feel,

39:53.010 --> 39:55.170
I would go back

39:53.010 --> 39:55.170
and revisit the conversation.

39:55.179 --> 39:58.170
That there's no splinters left.

39:58.179 --> 40:00.179
- There's gonna be splinters.

40:00.190 --> 40:02.170
I'd be stupid if I told you

40:02.179 --> 40:04.119
I trust her 100%.

40:04.130 --> 40:05.289
- I'm trying to be better,

40:06.000 --> 40:07.179
not bitter.

40:07.190 --> 40:09.130
- Oh.

40:07.190 --> 40:09.130
I like that.

40:09.139 --> 40:10.250
- [sighs]

40:09.139 --> 40:10.250
- Better, not bitter.

40:10.260 --> 40:13.210
[dramatic music]

40:18.170 --> 40:19.130
- We had dinner

40:18.280 --> 40:19.130
the other night and laughed.

40:20.199 --> 40:22.010
- Who?

40:20.199 --> 40:22.010
You and...

40:22.019 --> 40:23.230
- Dorit.

40:22.019 --> 40:23.230
- Door-eet!

40:23.239 --> 40:25.150
Kathy.

40:23.239 --> 40:25.150
- Dorit.

40:25.159 --> 40:26.280

My feet have not been

40:28.000 --> 40:29.280
in these kinds of shoes

40:29.289 --> 40:31.280
for a long time.

40:31.289 --> 40:32.260
- I'm drunk.

40:32.269 --> 40:34.219
And I haven't been drunk

40:32.269 --> 40:34.219
for eight months.

40:34.230 --> 40:36.260
- We haven't gotten

40:34.230 --> 40:36.260
to do this in so long.

40:36.269 --> 40:38.239
- So long.

40:36.269 --> 40:38.239
- I'm so happy you're here.

40:38.250 --> 40:40.130
- I'm so happy we're in love.

- Rinna!

40:46.179 --> 40:48.159
- Do we have to?

40:48.170 --> 40:50.199
- I wanna know, what has been

40:50.210 --> 40:53.110
your best moment during COVID

40:53.119 --> 40:55.150
and your hardest moment?

40:55.159 --> 40:56.190
How about that?

40:56.199 --> 40:58.019
- I think in the beginning,

40:58.030 --> 40:59.219
I would say

40:58.030 --> 40:59.219
for the first eight weeks,

40:59.230 --> 41:00.289
I stayed in the bed.

- Did you?

41:02.019 --> 41:03.159
- Yeah.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.019
- The worst part was,

41:03.170 --> 41:05.019
just for me,

41:05.030 --> 41:07.239
the beginning and the unknown

41:05.030 --> 41:07.239
because of my anxiety.

41:07.250 --> 41:11.000
But then I really loved

41:07.250 --> 41:11.000
having all of my kids

41:11.010 --> 41:12.099
home with me every day.

41:12.110 --> 41:13.139
That was really great.

41:13.150 --> 41:14.179
- We always say, like,

41:13.150 --> 41:14.179
"My God."

41:14.190 --> 41:17.019
Like, we would have never had

41:17.030 --> 41:18.199
- Right.

- They're eight and five.

That, like, they would be,

- No.

41:26.030 --> 41:27.210
- Oh, yeah.

41:27.219 --> 41:30.030
- Then I would look at all

41:27.219 --> 41:30.030
the parents doing TikTok,

41:30.039 --> 41:32.030
and I was like, "There's nobody

I was walking down
