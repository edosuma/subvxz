WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:01.861
- I'm sorry... It's blinking. 
- Really? 

00:01.966 --> 00:02.761
Yeah look... 

00:04.266 --> 00:10.261
Hey Ally, it's me... Coming from beautiful downtown Afghanistan.

00:10.348 --> 00:13.969
And this over here is my buddy Tommy Lehane.

00:14.158 --> 00:17.593
Two-time Orange County short board surfing champion

00:17.686 --> 00:19.672
and my personal bodyguard...

00:19.831 --> 00:21.402
Hey, hey, hey, Michael's sister.

00:21.931 --> 00:24.050
Hey, is she hot, dude? Can you hook me up?

00:24.214 --> 00:26.769
Chill, brother. She's totally married.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.391
And a mom.

00:28.772 --> 00:30.451
Hey, Joe. Hey, kids.

00:30.570 --> 00:33.164
Uh, Bridgette, Ariel, and...

00:33.403 --> 00:35.669
I can't remember what the other one's name is.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.089
Anyways, Uncle Mike is doing fine.

00:38.201 --> 00:42.226
Just over here fighting for freedom and beer...

00:43.547 --> 00:46.460
and chips and dip and whatnot.

00:46.525 --> 00:50.039
So don't worry. The company just sent us this camera

00:50.090 --> 00:51.567
so we could send back video letters,

00:51.626 --> 00:53.705
and I was the first one who got it, so...

00:53.776 --> 00:55.543
Yeah, 'cause he's still learning how to write.

00:56.512 --> 00:58.801
Stand down, soldier. Stand down.

00:59.399 --> 01:01.913
Anyways, we're over here in, uh...

01:02.261 --> 01:03.843
I don't even know where the hell we are.

01:03.899 --> 01:04.815
We just got here.

01:04.938 --> 01:09.024
Uh, we're protecting some shelled-out little village that nobody's ever heard of.

01:09.312 --> 01:10.586
And this over here...

01:11.405 --> 01:12.542
Incoming!

01:14.724 --> 01:17.516
Incoming! Medic!

01:18.159 --> 01:18.903
Medic!

02:10.151 --> 02:11.847
Benoit. B-E-N-0-I-T.

02:12.041 --> 02:13.650
He's with the 47th Infantry.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.786
My name? Dubois.

02:18.811 --> 02:19.814
Well, I'm married.

02:21.713 --> 02:23.607
No. Benoit's not my maiden name.

02:25.358 --> 02:26.568
He's my half brother.

02:27.556 --> 02:29.168
No, wait, wait.

02:30.243 --> 02:32.143
I just called them. They told me to call you.

02:33.183 --> 02:34.365
Yes, I'll hold.

02:34.646 --> 02:37.038
Hey, there's nothing on the CNN website

02:37.100 --> 02:40.197
or the State Department home page about any attack involving the 47th.

02:40.264 --> 02:41.508
The kids are dressed, they're fed.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.468
- So I'm just going to run them off to school.
- Hello?

02:43.545 --> 02:46.254
Hello. Yes, I'm looking for information on the 47th Infantry.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.060
My brother-- Specialist Michael Benoit.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.317
Ma'am, please don't transfer me.

02:51.399 --> 02:54.764
I have been on the phone with every branch of the government since 5:30 a.m.

02:56.018 --> 02:58.246
She's going to check. She's actually going to check.

02:58.986 --> 03:00.995
Yes, I am a family member.

03:01.062 --> 03:01.744
Hey.

03:02.311 --> 03:03.277
I'm his sister.

03:04.427 --> 03:06.334
Okay, you're transferring me to who?

03:06.833 --> 03:09.560
All right, can you give me the direct dial number just in case we get...

03:09.812 --> 03:11.418
Hello? Hello?

03:12.259 --> 03:13.254
Damn it!

03:14.452 --> 03:15.674
Got disconnected.

03:17.962 --> 03:19.432
Is Mom okay?

03:19.504 --> 03:20.605
Mom's just worried.

03:20.753 --> 03:23.123
Take your sister. Put her in the car seat. I'll be right out.

03:23.573 --> 03:25.068
Okay, good girl.

03:25.196 --> 03:26.728
Okay, go on, go on.

03:27.915 --> 03:28.616
Here.

03:28.694 --> 03:30.844
- What are you doing, Joe?
- Just stop for a minute.

03:31.028 --> 03:32.544
You've been on the phone for three hours.

03:32.621 --> 03:35.227
I've checked all the news services and the government websites.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.527
You've called every agency imaginable.

03:37.778 --> 03:40.337
And no one knows anything about any ambush on the 47th.

03:40.402 --> 03:41.644
Well, maybe they haven't found them yet.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.348
Maybe they're not releasing the information.

03:44.508 --> 03:46.056
Maybe it hasn't happened yet.

03:46.568 --> 03:47.506
I could warn them, Joe.

03:47.572 --> 03:49.374
I could warn them, if someone would just listen to me.

03:49.462 --> 03:50.788
It's 8:25 in the morning.

03:51.003 --> 03:52.497
Don't you have an appointment with your boss at 10:00?

03:52.559 --> 03:53.930
Yeah. I don't think I'm going to make that.

03:53.997 --> 03:57.241
Right. You need to stay home and worry about something that may or may not have happened

03:57.296 --> 04:00.284
to someone you haven't seen in five years and didn't much like before that.

04:00.356 --> 04:02.240
- He's my brother.
- Well...

04:02.363 --> 04:04.469
Well, we have the same mother.

04:04.570 --> 04:06.338
Okay, but you didn't exactly grow up together.

04:06.419 --> 04:09.382
I don't care about that. I'm talking about somebody who might be laying dead in the dirt somewhere.

04:09.463 --> 04:11.498
More likely passed out in a bar somewhere.

04:11.554 --> 04:12.896
I can't believe you just said that.

04:12.957 --> 04:15.752
Allison, the man missed our wedding because he was so stoned at the airport

04:15.815 --> 04:18.548
and having such a trippy time watching the planes taking off and landing,

04:18.606 --> 04:19.781
that he forgot to get on one.

04:19.844 --> 04:21.390
That was 11 years ago.

04:21.461 --> 04:24.328
Look, I'm just saying it's the 21st century, okay?

04:24.390 --> 04:27.201
When something like this happens, it's on the news in 15 minutes.

04:27.298 --> 04:28.969
I  think the thing to do is go on with our day.

04:29.029 --> 04:30.442
You know what? Go on with your day.

04:31.411 --> 04:32.490
So you're not going to work?

04:32.607 --> 04:33.883
I'm going to work!

04:33.975 --> 04:35.439
I'm going to work!

04:38.306 --> 04:39.514
I love you, too.

04:39.898 --> 04:43.190
And in international news today, no reports of American casualties

04:43.314 --> 04:46.954
for the sixth straight day in either Iraq or Afghanistan...

04:47.497 --> 04:50.892
Oil production remains steady as tensions continue to ease

04:50.938 --> 04:54.378
and American forces report no casualties for the sixth straight day in a row...

04:54.430 --> 04:56.503
It's not a police action, it's a war.

04:56.569 --> 04:58.684
Well, right now it's apparently no action,

04:58.772 --> 05:03.230
since reports from both Iraq and Afghanistan indicate a prolonged period of calm.

05:06.819 --> 05:08.345
- What's this?
- What does it look like?

05:08.674 --> 05:10.379
- An address.
- Incredible.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.909
And still some people doubt you.

05:11.986 --> 05:13.655
You know, I'm so not in the mood.

05:13.998 --> 05:14.695
Sorry.

05:17.457 --> 05:18.264
Something wrong?

05:19.462 --> 05:20.660
I don't know. Maybe not.

05:20.742 --> 05:22.759
Certainly all the evidence says it's nothing.

05:24.644 --> 05:26.941
It's nothing. So what's this?

05:27.034 --> 05:28.533
Like you said, just an address.

05:28.621 --> 05:31.832
But I'd like you to drive over there, maybe spend some time.

05:31.919 --> 05:33.455
See if you get any kind of impression off of it.

05:33.526 --> 05:35.819
I mean, is it a house? Is it a business?

05:36.327 --> 05:38.145
I'm confused. Is it a crime scene?

05:38.262 --> 05:40.060
I mean, isn't there some kind of file I could look at?

05:40.162 --> 05:40.909
Nope.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.621
If it's all right with you, I'd like to hear what you think after you've been there.

05:45.051 --> 05:47.054
Without any kind of influence from me.

06:44.511 --> 06:45.402
Who are you?

06:50.942 --> 06:52.487
I  asked who you were.

06:55.319 --> 06:56.654
My name's Allison.

06:57.255 --> 06:58.268
What's your name?

07:00.040 --> 07:01.294
Is this your house?

07:02.753 --> 07:03.978
I'm Diedre.

07:08.252 --> 07:09.523
Are you Daddy's friend?

07:10.245 --> 07:12.769
Mom says you're the reason he comes home late every night

07:13.009 --> 07:14.766
and is on the phone all the time.

07:15.922 --> 07:18.166
No, honey, I've never even met your dad.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.511
Is he here?

07:20.869 --> 07:21.487
No.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.408
Not since the fire.

07:24.443 --> 07:27.242
Since the fire, Mom says he's with her.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.730
What about your mom? Is she here?

07:30.346 --> 07:31.504
I have to go to my room.

07:31.866 --> 07:32.548
Wait.

07:35.368 --> 07:36.138
Wait.

07:42.389 --> 07:46.035
The fire was set intentionally in two places at around 3:00 in the morning.

07:46.105 --> 07:48.600
The first ignition site was outside the daughter's room.

07:48.645 --> 07:51.215
The second ignition site was the master bedroom.

07:52.061 --> 07:55.368
We believe that the wife woke up and tried to save the daughter but couldn't.

07:55.444 --> 07:58.339
The daughter perished. The wife has been in a coma for several weeks.

07:58.413 --> 08:00.062
She's not expected to recover.

08:00.302 --> 08:01.451
What about the husband?

08:01.520 --> 08:04.304
Husband claims to have been working all night in his office

08:04.373 --> 08:05.899
trying to get out a last minute deadline.

08:05.966 --> 08:06.979
Anyone corroborate that?

08:07.390 --> 08:08.296
His assistant.

08:08.470 --> 08:09.191
A woman.

08:10.277 --> 08:12.664
The daughter mentioned that her father had a friend.

08:13.021 --> 08:15.039
Sounds like the marriage had some trouble.

08:16.042 --> 08:17.352
The daughter mentioned that?

08:18.633 --> 08:20.221
She happen to tell you who set the fire?

08:20.379 --> 08:22.324
Well, she wanted to, but I wouldn't let her.

08:22.392 --> 08:24.869
I told her you'd be upset if she made it too easy for us.

08:26.441 --> 08:28.245
Any chance the assistant's the friend?

08:28.311 --> 08:29.431
We're watching both of them.

08:30.583 --> 08:33.522
So how'd you like to spend some quality time with the comatose mother?

08:34.096 --> 08:34.899
Excuse me?

08:35.166 --> 08:38.149
Well, I don't really know how these things work, but you never know.

08:38.207 --> 08:41.308
She might have seen something-- might have even seen who did it.

08:41.565 --> 08:46.275
But how does that work? If someone's in a coma do you... can you...?

08:46.352 --> 08:48.564
I don't know. But she's in the hospital, right?

08:48.652 --> 08:50.274
I'm really not crazy about hospitals.

08:50.362 --> 08:53.428
Oh. Well, I just assumed. I mean, you've had three kids.

08:55.820 --> 08:59.454
You know what, it's fine. Set it up. I'll be fine.

08:59.589 --> 09:03.889
...yards from the Americans. Two Americans were killed. A third died...

09:04.196 --> 09:07.201
...views on democracy and the Middle East has...

09:08.678 --> 09:12.531
Okay, kisses, stories...

09:12.782 --> 09:14.205
It is so not my bedtime.

09:14.257 --> 09:16.433
Yeah, we want to watch cartoons.

09:17.574 --> 09:18.553
Someone's here.

09:23.651 --> 09:25.401
There's a car in front of the house.

09:25.475 --> 09:29.172
It has a big eagle on the door, like the President's car.

09:29.792 --> 09:32.602
Dad, two soldiers are getting out.

09:32.776 --> 09:33.964
Oh, my God.

09:34.292 --> 09:38.020
Ariel, go to your room. Take your sister. Go.

09:59.888 --> 10:02.088
You little bastard!

10:02.171 --> 10:04.165
You hear that? She called me a bastard.

10:04.508 --> 10:07.050
My own sister called me a bastard.

10:07.132 --> 10:09.211
That's the last time I fight a war for you.

10:10.394 --> 10:12.384
- Hey, Joe.
- Welcome home, Mike.

10:18.762 --> 10:19.717
Quit staring.

10:19.805 --> 10:22.103
Ever since he walked in you've been acting like you've seen a ghost,

10:22.211 --> 10:23.439
not in your usual way.

10:23.521 --> 10:24.725
I can't help it.

10:24.847 --> 10:26.179
The dream really spooked me.

10:26.332 --> 10:27.627
Don't say anything, okay?

10:28.391 --> 10:29.163
About the dream?

10:29.267 --> 10:32.291
About my dream, or working in the D.A.'s office, or any of it.

10:32.588 --> 10:33.674
They wouldn't understand.

10:33.735 --> 10:34.417
Okay.

10:36.342 --> 10:38.170
I'll get it. Go. Be with your brother.

10:45.138 --> 10:46.305
Oh, there we go.

10:46.557 --> 10:48.509
Oh, man, chips and salsa.

10:48.903 --> 10:51.108
Just  like Mom used to open.

10:51.399 --> 10:53.639
We've been living on MRE's and hummus for a year.

10:53.717 --> 10:55.911
I'll tell you, that gets real old, real fast.

10:56.018 --> 10:58.404
So when did all this happen? When did you get out?

10:58.895 --> 11:01.112
And why didn't you call and let me know you were coming to town?

11:02.009 --> 11:04.392
Our tour just ended last month.

11:05.081 --> 11:05.775
Really?

11:05.925 --> 11:08.148
Took us about a week to get a transport to Germany.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.882
And  then we hung around for a few days until we could hook up

11:10.933 --> 11:13.022
something to good old South Carolina.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.545
Finally landed in Sky Harbor today at noon.

11:17.106 --> 11:20.087
- God bless America.
- God bless America.

11:20.948 --> 11:24.301
And then you were our first stop. So back off, Sis...

11:24.438 --> 11:25.981
We could've hitched a ride all the way to Cali,

11:26.027 --> 11:29.211
but Michael said we had to stop here and see his big sister first.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.043
Well... and we have that thing.

11:32.243 --> 11:32.996
What thing?

11:33.655 --> 11:35.253
A memorial service.

11:36.698 --> 11:38.423
One of our buddies didn't make it back.

11:39.375 --> 11:40.373
Our sergeant.

11:40.506 --> 11:41.407
I'm sorry.

11:41.776 --> 11:42.915
Yeah, he was a good guy.

11:45.357 --> 11:46.399
Very good guy.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.017
So, Mike...

11:49.748 --> 11:51.259
what's your plan now that you're back?

11:51.569 --> 11:55.989
Yeah, besides laying on my couch, drinking beer and watching court shows?

11:57.029 --> 11:58.780
Well, as a matter of fact...

12:00.953 --> 12:04.059
comfortable and roomy as it may be,

12:04.831 --> 12:11.009
this couch holds absolutely no interest to this soldier come 0800 Monday morning.

12:11.089 --> 12:12.174
Oh, really? Why is that?

12:12.240 --> 12:13.551
That is because

12:14.586 --> 12:18.641
that is when Tommy and I are off to San Diego, California

12:18.871 --> 12:21.585
to open ourselves up a surf shop.

12:21.656 --> 12:22.681
A what shop?

12:22.788 --> 12:27.842
Right on the beach, up to our asses in long boards and beach bunnies.

12:30.991 --> 12:33.155
Is that something you want to do or something you're going to do?

12:33.212 --> 12:36.186
Oh, no, it's already a done deal. We're already incorporated and everything.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.060
Yeah, Tommy's coming into some money.

12:38.139 --> 12:39.770
Yeah, I got a little inheritance from my grandfather.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.169
A friend's renting us the storefront.

12:41.226 --> 12:43.785
Looks like Mikey's grown-up card is finally getting punched.

12:43.944 --> 12:47.584
You got it, man. Me and Lucky are gonna be merchants.

12:48.302 --> 12:49.279
"Lucky"?

12:50.339 --> 12:51.209
It's a nickname.

12:51.363 --> 12:53.769
It's not a nickname, man. I'm telling you, it's a fact.

12:54.426 --> 12:59.259
This guy is my lucky rabbit's foot. He's my four-leaf clover.

12:59.704 --> 13:02.179
Hell, I wouldn't have made it back in one piece if it weren't for him.

13:02.326 --> 13:03.907
- Really?
- Cut him off. Cut him off.

13:04.122 --> 13:06.786
No, man, come on. I put my life in this guy's hands, okay?

13:06.872 --> 13:10.282
Everybody did. Lucky said "zig," you zigged.

13:10.399 --> 13:12.826
Lucky said "zag," ooh... you better zag.

13:12.948 --> 13:14.163
Zag, zig, zag.

13:15.489 --> 13:18.866
My tank is full. I have to whiz. So...

13:18.997 --> 13:20.987
- Down the hall.
- Oh, whoa, whoa!

13:21.894 --> 13:22.628
I got it.

13:24.347 --> 13:25.177
All the way down.

13:25.637 --> 13:26.513
The end of the hall.

13:29.452 --> 13:30.711
He's something, ain't he?

13:33.297 --> 13:34.105
That's my cab.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.219
Oh, goodness, I forgot. Do you need a place to stay?

13:37.296 --> 13:38.612
Oh, no, no, no. No, thanks.

13:38.693 --> 13:43.098
No, actually, I'm looking forward to getting a little room service if you know what I mean.

13:44.735 --> 13:45.481
I'm sorry.

13:45.706 --> 13:47.601
It was real nice meeting you folks.

13:48.638 --> 13:50.500
Tell the kid I'll be back for him tomorrow, okay?

13:51.694 --> 13:53.592
You  sure you don't want to wait and say good-bye to Michael?

13:53.680 --> 13:54.673
Oh, no, that's okay.

13:54.755 --> 13:55.820
You can tuck him in for me.

13:56.071 --> 13:57.827
He looks pretty good, don't you think?

13:58.984 --> 14:01.119
For a functional alcoholic, absolutely.

14:01.559 --> 14:03.536
You know he's still out there drinking by himself?

14:03.823 --> 14:06.844
Wow, who died and appointed you the mayor of Funville?

14:07.089 --> 14:07.924
You're forgetting,

14:09.127 --> 14:11.984
I've done my fair share of drinking once upon a time.

14:12.731 --> 14:15.650
In fact, I did your fair share, too.

14:15.829 --> 14:19.028
I believe that you were attempting to quiet the voices in your head.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.273
What's his excuse?

14:20.970 --> 14:23.535
I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.334
Excuse me?

14:24.430 --> 14:26.453
Have you seen the pile of empties next to your brother?

14:27.021 --> 14:31.363
I'm getting up early and taking all those bottles to the recycler so I can retire a wealthy man.

14:31.736 --> 14:32.853
That's not nice.

14:34.629 --> 14:35.628
He just got home.

14:36.412 --> 14:38.050
He's been through a lot.

14:38.505 --> 14:39.694
They both have.

14:40.671 --> 14:41.993
But he's alive.

14:42.202 --> 14:43.683
He's home. He's here.

14:45.096 --> 14:46.181
And he's alive.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.852
Hey, kid, you want to turn those down for me?

15:03.425 --> 15:06.767
Wow, you don't sleep in jammies?

15:09.522 --> 15:10.239
Damn.

15:11.857 --> 15:14.268
I knew I forgot to do something last night.

15:18.605 --> 15:19.990
Where is everybody?

15:20.992 --> 15:21.888
Where's your mom?

15:21.965 --> 15:23.910
She's getting ready for work.

15:24.454 --> 15:26.056
Since when does she work?

15:27.515 --> 15:28.605
What does she do?

15:29.430 --> 15:30.766
She's a guesser.

15:31.134 --> 15:32.461
For the State.

15:33.413 --> 15:34.555
A "guesser."

15:36.663 --> 15:37.744
What's that?

15:40.560 --> 15:43.723
Well, you tell your mother good morning for me

15:43.812 --> 15:46.356
and tell her I wish her...

15:47.339 --> 15:49.823
good guessing.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.264
- Ready?
- One second.

15:57.381 --> 16:00.984
Oh, maybe you misunderstood. There's nothing to record. The woman's in a coma.

16:01.081 --> 16:02.762
This isn't for her. This is for me.

16:02.812 --> 16:03.458
Excuse me?

16:03.569 --> 16:06.647
Look, you see a hospital and you think "care, hope, life."

16:06.718 --> 16:07.805
And it is all of that.

16:07.953 --> 16:11.373
But I get within 100 feet of one of these places and every soul that's passed

16:11.430 --> 16:15.145
within the last 24 hours and is still roaming the halls thinks,

16:15.224 --> 16:16.755
"Oh, great, there's a medium on the floor."

16:16.842 --> 16:19.714
"One last chance to tell Aunt Tilly that the will's in the closet."

16:20.501 --> 16:22.064
Okay, but I still don't get...

16:22.646 --> 16:25.637
When they realize I can't hear them, they tend to leave me alone.

16:44.759 --> 16:46.308
I want to prepare you.

16:46.384 --> 16:48.263
She's burned over 30 percent of her body.

16:48.325 --> 16:49.685
Been in a coma for three weeks.

16:49.763 --> 16:53.606
Her prognosis for survival is slim, but there's still plenty of brain wave activity.

16:53.682 --> 16:55.277
Okay, I want to prepare you.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.841
I've never tried to get something off of someone in a coma before.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.217
- I mean, I'll do the best I can.
- That's all I'm asking.

17:36.745 --> 17:38.557
Would you like to hold her hand?

17:39.182 --> 17:40.119
Oh? May I?

17:40.375 --> 17:41.035
Sure.

17:53.646 --> 17:56.140
Hey, how are you feeling?

17:58.935 --> 17:59.872
Wow.

18:01.305 --> 18:05.375
I took her hand and suddenly everything just went black.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.345
I don't know if it was fear or...

18:09.681 --> 18:13.101
anger or some amazing kind of rage.

18:14.315 --> 18:16.630
Well, I suppose I'd feel all that, too,

18:16.691 --> 18:20.116
if I knew that my spouse had tried to burn me and my child to death.

18:21.057 --> 18:22.082
Did she see him?

18:22.651 --> 18:24.309
Did she see anyone set that fire?

18:26.988 --> 18:28.334
That's what I'm trying to tell you,

18:29.179 --> 18:32.650
all I saw, all she showed me was black.

18:33.542 --> 18:35.031
I got to go get my kids.

18:36.296 --> 18:38.067
Who told you that? I didn't hear that.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.609
Mike?

18:46.319 --> 18:48.318
Michael, I'm home with the girls.

18:49.689 --> 18:51.912
You guys... here, take your sister, go change her.

18:52.070 --> 18:53.597
- Go.
- Come on. Bridge, quick.

18:54.056 --> 18:54.964
M ichael.

18:55.921 --> 18:57.308
What are you watching?

19:21.323 --> 19:23.713
- Ally.
- I just brought the girls home from school.

19:24.117 --> 19:25.366
Little Oral Annie?

19:27.036 --> 19:28.254
I guess you were right,

19:28.966 --> 19:30.572
it's not a kid's movie.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.266
Want a beer?

19:34.013 --> 19:34.977
I'm sorry.

19:36.713 --> 19:38.843
You sure you want to go into business with this numskull?

19:39.006 --> 19:40.527
What, are you kidding me?

19:40.634 --> 19:43.041
See, I think you know your little brother, but I'm telling you, you don't.

19:43.209 --> 19:46.021
This guy's a born leader. Now, our sergeant, he was in charge,

19:46.095 --> 19:48.737
- but he wasn't the guy people listened to.
- Knock it off.

19:48.851 --> 19:50.941
He wasn't the guy whose word you depended on, you know what I'm saying?

19:50.993 --> 19:54.787
- Tommy, leave it alone. 
- I'm not saying anything against the guy, God rest his soul.

19:54.848 --> 19:57.556
I'm just saying that when the chips were down and the sides were taken,

19:57.633 --> 19:59.190
- Tommy...
- I knew I could count on Lucky...

19:59.266 --> 20:00.388
Hey! Tommy!

20:05.550 --> 20:06.526
Shut up, man.

20:14.267 --> 20:15.535
Got to drain the snake.

20:15.696 --> 20:16.382
Bridgette.

20:17.390 --> 20:18.134
Come here, baby.

20:18.763 --> 20:21.283
Did you meet Tommy? This is Uncle Michael's friend, Tommy.

20:25.544 --> 20:26.823
At ease, soldier.

20:26.951 --> 20:29.367
Hey, mister, did you ever kill someone?

20:29.490 --> 20:30.274
Bridgette!

20:30.688 --> 20:32.414
I'm sorry. She's in first grade...

20:32.492 --> 20:33.802
Don't worry about it. That's okay.

20:33.924 --> 20:34.703
Come here, sweetie.

20:35.665 --> 20:36.505
I'll tell you what.

20:37.509 --> 20:38.394
I don't know.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.320
I shot a few, I guess, but...

20:41.082 --> 20:43.074
that was only 'cause they were shooting at me.

20:51.264 --> 20:52.798
Hey, you okay?

20:53.473 --> 20:55.845
I'm fine. I'm fine.

20:55.941 --> 20:58.289
Bridgette, come on. Let's go do your homework.

20:58.450 --> 20:59.346
Get rid of that.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.902
He's a soldier, Allison.

21:01.993 --> 21:03.449
Killing is what soldiers do.

21:03.627 --> 21:06.233
I mean, I actually thought the guy was sort of a positive influence.

21:06.324 --> 21:07.877
No. I know, I thought so, too.

21:07.953 --> 21:10.615
It's just there's something about the way that they are together.

21:11.297 --> 21:12.351
Wait. Shh!

21:14.357 --> 21:16.555
Do you hear that? Is that the TV?

21:17.199 --> 21:18.618
He's gonna wake the girls.

21:19.781 --> 21:21.194
Allison, what are you talking about?

21:25.623 --> 21:26.468
Michael...?

21:27.413 --> 21:28.235
Michael.

21:42.202 --> 21:43.154
Hey, Sis.

21:43.865 --> 21:44.818
What's going on?

21:46.820 --> 21:47.762
What do you mean?

21:48.422 --> 21:49.584
I heard a voice.

21:52.002 --> 21:53.484
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:53.780 --> 21:57.110
A voice. A man's voice. And it wasn't your voice.

21:57.721 --> 22:00.280
And it was very agitated.

22:01.032 --> 22:02.856
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

22:06.122 --> 22:07.443
I'm the only one in here.

22:08.564 --> 22:09.327
Yeah...

22:13.025 --> 22:15.298
Well, it sounded like he was talking to you.

22:17.874 --> 22:19.848
But if I'm the only one here...

22:21.467 --> 22:22.286
Right.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.153
Of course.

22:35.111 --> 22:37.564
Sometimes this makes it easier to sleep.

22:40.631 --> 22:41.543
You think so?

22:52.658 --> 22:56.103
Hmm, I'm feeling sleepier already.

22:58.664 --> 23:01.243
Now you want to get out of here so I can get some rest or what?

23:06.512 --> 23:07.178
Right.

23:19.705 --> 23:20.761
I'll see you in the morning.

23:54.990 --> 23:56.880
Would you like to see our school?

24:00.858 --> 24:01.871
It was her idea.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.021
One more time.

24:07.559 --> 24:08.589
Soft...

24:10.119 --> 24:11.005
slow.

24:13.760 --> 24:16.520
Mom is driving us to school.

24:16.797 --> 24:18.281
Want to come?

24:19.208 --> 24:20.943
That was nice of you to do that.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.405
It meant a lot to the girls.

24:24.651 --> 24:27.292
I got to pee so bad I can taste it.

24:28.915 --> 24:30.006
I kind of like it.

24:32.853 --> 24:35.100
Is that beer in Bridgette's cup?

24:35.925 --> 24:37.246
That's beer, isn't it?

24:43.426 --> 24:44.598
You got to be kidding me.

24:44.650 --> 24:45.863
Get rid of it now.

24:47.685 --> 24:48.351
Fine.

25:04.156 --> 25:05.620
Where are we headed, anyways?

25:05.856 --> 25:08.432
One little stop-- something I have to do for work.

25:18.421 --> 25:20.403
Wait. Did you do this?

25:21.115 --> 25:24.284
Kowabunga! You're a pyromaniac.

25:24.822 --> 25:26.122
Wait here a second, will you?

25:27.228 --> 25:28.364
Nice job, sis.

25:43.212 --> 25:45.024
I was hoping I would find you here.

25:45.408 --> 25:48.691
I wanted to ask you about that night, about the fire.

25:49.535 --> 25:52.233
I wanted to ask you if you maybe saw something.

25:52.496 --> 25:54.174
Maybe who might have set it.

25:58.363 --> 26:02.040
Honey... it's important that we know the truth.

26:02.551 --> 26:05.151
Even if the truth involves someone we love.

26:07.461 --> 26:09.237
I'm guessing you did see.

26:09.668 --> 26:11.691
And I'm guessing it was someone you knew.

26:13.492 --> 26:14.761
Was it your father?

26:16.229 --> 26:19.764
- Hey! My teeth are floating...
- Diedre!

26:19.995 --> 26:20.794
Diedre!

26:22.196 --> 26:22.883
Wait!

26:24.162 --> 26:25.068
Diedre!

26:26.755 --> 26:27.823
Diedre!

26:35.406 --> 26:36.061
Hey!

26:38.990 --> 26:39.840
What are you doing?

26:40.121 --> 26:41.713
Trying not to wet my pants.

26:41.939 --> 26:43.777
No. Who are you making faces at?

26:43.930 --> 26:48.109
I'm not making faces; this is what I look like when my bladder's about to explode.

26:48.225 --> 26:49.593
You see her, don't you?

26:49.696 --> 26:51.385
- See who?
- That little girl.

26:51.447 --> 26:54.304
I'm guessing she's up in her room standing by the window?

26:56.178 --> 27:00.091
Hey... sis, there's nothing there.

27:00.171 --> 27:01.678
Don't play with me, Michael.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.427
A little girl died in this house.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.175
Her mother's still in a coma.

27:05.265 --> 27:07.717
And the fire that did it, it was intentionally set.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.875
The police believe the husband was responsible,

27:09.997 --> 27:11.593
but they're having a hard time proving it.

27:11.672 --> 27:12.174
Okay.

27:12.239 --> 27:13.832
I work for the District Attorney's Office.

27:13.909 --> 27:15.866
I help them with cases, difficult cases,

27:15.921 --> 27:18.389
cases that can't be solved by conventional means.

27:19.053 --> 27:21.374
I can see things that other people can't.

27:23.355 --> 27:25.655
- You can "see" things?
- That's right.

27:26.377 --> 27:31.035
Oh, so that's what the kid meant by a "guesser," huh?

27:33.145 --> 27:33.887
So...

27:35.147 --> 27:37.133
how's my surf shop gonna do?

27:38.121 --> 27:40.129
Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27:40.201 --> 27:42.944
I... I guess I should take this more seriously.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.213
You really don't want to have this conversation, huh, Michael?

27:45.296 --> 27:46.313
What conversation?

27:46.397 --> 27:48.838
- You saw that little girl.
- I didn't see anything!

27:48.904 --> 27:51.356
And the other night you heard that man screaming at you.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.482
What I have, you have.

27:53.599 --> 27:55.611
What I have, you have.

27:55.924 --> 27:56.989
That's really sweet.

27:57.086 --> 28:00.261
And, you know, if it were blue eyes or a weakness for fried foods, I'd be tickled.

28:00.327 --> 28:02.795
But you know something, I have to draw the line at psychosis.

28:02.927 --> 28:04.172
You're on your own there, sis.

28:04.254 --> 28:05.939
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

28:06.175 --> 28:11.366
Michael, your nickname is "Lucky" because you can see things before they happen, right?

28:11.540 --> 28:14.407
That must be a very valuable talent in a war zone.

28:14.608 --> 28:19.215
Sorry, sis, I've seen way too much real life to believe in any of this mumbo jumbo.

28:19.287 --> 28:20.060
Oh, really?

28:20.138 --> 28:22.138
Yeah. Really.

28:22.246 --> 28:23.480
You're half right.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.246
I've said a couple things that turned out true,

28:26.311 --> 28:29.103
but that's not so hard when all someone's asking is,

28:29.153 --> 28:31.550
"Are we gonna live or are we gonna die today?"

28:31.723 --> 28:33.038
You're bound to be half right--

28:33.131 --> 28:35.553
and if I'm wrong, there's not gonna be anyone around to prove it.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.806
You want to know what I believe in?

28:38.216 --> 28:39.772
I believe in percentages.

28:40.263 --> 28:42.338
Now, does that make me psychic?

28:43.407 --> 28:44.155
Me?

28:48.143 --> 28:49.428
I say the wife did it.

28:50.043 --> 28:53.494
And, hell, I got a 50/50 shot of being right.

28:57.712 --> 28:58.333
Yeah?

28:58.403 --> 29:00.684
Specialists Lehane and Benoit requesting permission to enter, sir.

29:00.734 --> 29:01.513
Come on in.

29:07.309 --> 29:10.052
Hey, Sarge, uh, Lucky and me were wondering

29:10.093 --> 29:11.588
if we could talk to you about those orders for tomorrow?

29:11.639 --> 29:12.591
What about them?

29:13.155 --> 29:15.765
Well, sir, it seems that, uh, Lucky here has had...

29:15.868 --> 29:16.914
one of his feelings.

29:18.962 --> 29:20.972
You guys are kidding me with this stuff, right?

29:21.204 --> 29:21.935
No, sir.

29:22.084 --> 29:23.517
This man's intoxicated.

29:25.227 --> 29:26.784
Hey, come on, man, pull yourself together.

29:26.862 --> 29:28.217
Tell the sergeant what you saw.

29:29.882 --> 29:31.514
Um, I don't know, Sarge,

29:31.670 --> 29:35.294
we're standing in the middle of this Afghan village,

29:35.377 --> 29:37.511
and I'm talking to my sister...

29:37.588 --> 29:41.003
What? Your sister lives in an Afghan village?

29:41.162 --> 29:42.861
No, man, you're explaining it all wrong.

29:43.671 --> 29:45.585
We get to that village, 'kay?

29:45.887 --> 29:50.276
Sometime during the day, the enemy's gonna start hitting us with mortars, all right?

29:50.439 --> 29:51.994
And according to Lucky...

29:52.802 --> 29:54.116
none of us survive.

29:55.242 --> 29:55.949
Really?

29:56.574 --> 29:57.327
Yes, sir.

29:57.525 --> 29:58.759
But he doesn't look worried.

29:59.358 --> 30:00.547
You worried, soldier?

30:02.389 --> 30:04.382
Is there somewhere that I could sit down?

30:04.522 --> 30:05.728
Oh, man. Come on.

30:11.265 --> 30:14.985
Look, Sarge, I know he's a sloppy drunk, okay?

30:15.138 --> 30:17.309
But I've been with the guy eight months, and I'm telling you,

30:17.373 --> 30:19.293
when he tells you something's gonna to happen...

30:19.399 --> 30:21.089
What are we talking about here, huh?

30:21.149 --> 30:23.269
Winning card games? Flipping quarters?

30:24.453 --> 30:26.162
We're in a war here, mister.

30:26.592 --> 30:30.530
You seriously expect me to disobey or disregard an order because some alcoholic

30:30.598 --> 30:32.215
told you we're all gonna die?

30:33.350 --> 30:34.989
That guy's a world-class screw-up.

30:35.281 --> 30:38.675
Been in this man's army eight years and can't rise above specialist.

30:38.947 --> 30:39.760
But you...

30:40.161 --> 30:41.858
you ain't barely been in a year--

30:42.176 --> 30:43.918
you're going home in three weeks, brother--

30:44.250 --> 30:47.758
and you'd risk a dishonorable 'cause along with pink elephants,

30:47.831 --> 30:50.349
the town drunk here told you he saw a vision?

30:50.769 --> 30:54.215
Get out of here before I throw your cowardly ass in the stockade.

30:58.977 --> 31:01.526
Sir, don't you think we could just maybe...

31:01.766 --> 31:04.373
just get lost, you know, maybe... show up a day late?

31:04.439 --> 31:06.599
And be sure and take your trash with you when you go.

31:10.732 --> 31:11.592
Yes, Sir.

31:14.670 --> 31:15.925
Come on, man, get up!

31:17.579 --> 31:18.449
Wait a second.

31:22.386 --> 31:23.896
Just arrived from H.Q.

31:24.095 --> 31:27.141
When we get where we're going tomorrow, you two lovebirds can make a tape,

31:27.223 --> 31:29.923
let your families see that you cowards are safe and sound.

31:30.004 --> 31:33.358
- Now, get your asses out of here.
- Hey. Look at that.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.790
I said get your sorry asses out of here.

31:35.867 --> 31:40.008
You two are the sorriest excuses for soldiers that I've ever had the misfortune of knowing,

31:40.095 --> 31:43.035
and let me tell you something, Mr. "why-don't-we-all-just-show-up-

31:43.092 --> 31:44.880
a-day-late-or-maybe-not-at-all..."

31:46.301 --> 31:47.986
I'm pleading with you, soldier.

31:48.283 --> 31:51.801
You can't let my little boy grow up thinking his daddy was a coward,

31:52.200 --> 31:54.074
that his daddy killed himself.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.551
You can't go to that memorial tomorrow

31:56.603 --> 31:59.859
and let those people walk away thinking I did this to myself.

32:00.144 --> 32:03.684
I did not spend 14 years serving my country

32:03.776 --> 32:08.881
to have all that I accomplished undone by a drunken clown and his cowardly friend!

32:10.385 --> 32:12.591
Damn it, soldier, open your eyes!

32:12.900 --> 32:13.945
Look at me.

32:26.039 --> 32:27.676
You can see me, can't you?

32:29.841 --> 32:31.583
And you can hear me, too.

32:48.007 --> 32:49.390
It's 6:20 in the morning.

32:49.442 --> 32:50.281
You're up early.

32:50.950 --> 32:54.888
Michael, that man's family thinks he killed himself.

32:55.596 --> 32:57.368
He was here last night.

32:57.956 --> 32:59.493
I spoke to him.

33:00.009 --> 33:01.268
I know what happened.

33:01.658 --> 33:02.380
Really?

33:03.301 --> 33:05.632
Hey, Sis, you don't know anything,

33:06.364 --> 33:08.785
and for that matter, neither do I,

33:09.313 --> 33:12.804
and for everybody's sake, I say we just leave it that way.

33:12.973 --> 33:14.570
You have to tell them the truth.

33:14.647 --> 33:15.482
The truth?

33:15.784 --> 33:18.610
The truth is, far all I know, he blew his brains out.

33:18.826 --> 33:22.967
The truth is, he was just as terrified of going on that mission as we were. The truth...

33:25.123 --> 33:27.417
I told him not to ring the bell.

33:29.086 --> 33:30.126
I'll get it.

33:36.642 --> 33:37.493
He's in the kitchen.

33:38.406 --> 33:41.150
Tell him I'll be back in a minute. I'm going to go throw on some clothes.

33:45.403 --> 33:46.105
Hey.

33:47.102 --> 33:49.858
What's with your sister? She, uh... she's not a morning person, huh?

33:54.563 --> 33:56.386
You didn't tell her anything, did you?

33:56.731 --> 33:57.657
About what?

33:58.019 --> 33:58.818
Anything.

33:59.208 --> 34:03.191
About what you know, about what a person might suspect.

34:04.031 --> 34:04.859
No.

34:06.483 --> 34:08.331
It's just hard lookin' her in the eye is all.

34:10.098 --> 34:12.664
It's gonna be the same this morning with the sergeant's family, you know?

34:14.521 --> 34:16.795
Uh, no, I don't know, Mike.

34:21.947 --> 34:22.913
You listen to me.

34:24.388 --> 34:29.231
Now, for all the times that we coulda ended up caught, or hurt, or dead,

34:29.768 --> 34:33.291
but we came through because of whatever you dreamt, or what you saw?

34:33.732 --> 34:35.498
I owe you, okay?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.712
But now you owe me,

34:40.920 --> 34:42.630
'cause I'm saving your life.

34:43.373 --> 34:44.924
Here. Right now.

34:46.505 --> 34:49.165
See, without this plan, without this business we're gonna do together--

34:49.411 --> 34:51.576
you have nothing, and you know it.

34:52.972 --> 34:55.583
You can't function, you can't hold down a job, you can't...

34:55.697 --> 34:58.016
you can't live like a normal person. Look at you.

34:59.072 --> 35:00.007
Pathetic.

35:00.858 --> 35:01.621
You're right.

35:02.538 --> 35:03.408
I owe you.

35:03.561 --> 35:04.534
You're damn right.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.043
So I'm changing the plan. I'm gonna go to the memorial by myself.

35:09.122 --> 35:13.392
You're gonna stay here, and after it's all done, then we'll... sunny California.

35:13.464 --> 35:16.842
No. Can't. I can't do that. I gotta go to the memorial.

35:16.924 --> 35:18.468
- No, no, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

35:18.544 --> 35:20.499
No. Now, listen to me.

35:20.565 --> 35:22.189
That'll only mess you up, Mike.

35:23.583 --> 35:28.639
Mike, you gotta... you gotta learn to stay away from the things that hurt you.

35:30.263 --> 35:32.710
I mean, what are you, a pain freak? Huh?

35:32.971 --> 35:35.152
You just wanna feel bad?

35:38.191 --> 35:39.600
Now, come on.

35:39.935 --> 35:42.286
Come on. Sit down.

35:43.676 --> 35:46.974
I'll go to the memorial, pay our respects.

35:47.906 --> 35:51.362
And hey, don't... nobody's gonna think badly of you for not coming down there.

35:51.439 --> 35:55.764
Just... everybody handles grief in their own way.

35:56.047 --> 35:56.825
Right?

35:57.773 --> 35:58.546
Okay.

35:59.565 --> 36:00.398
Hey.

36:09.022 --> 36:09.974
You need a beer?

36:12.380 --> 36:14.085
No. I'm okay.

36:35.872 --> 36:37.150
I heard the front door.

36:37.530 --> 36:38.463
Tommy left.

36:40.658 --> 36:42.511
He's gonna go without me. Um...

36:44.249 --> 36:46.028
I don't know if I can handle it.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.129
You're kidding yourself.

36:48.296 --> 36:50.631
You think skipping the funeral's going to put an end to it?

36:51.189 --> 36:51.984
Michael.

36:52.531 --> 36:56.351
There is not enough beer in the world to drown out what you know.

36:56.561 --> 36:59.315
There aren't headphones tight enough. There isn't music loud enough.

36:59.381 --> 37:01.522
I don't know anything!

37:01.605 --> 37:03.080
That's a bunch of crap.

37:03.180 --> 37:03.985
Michael!

37:04.215 --> 37:06.846
You told Tommy what was going to happen.

37:06.996 --> 37:08.795
You told him about your dream,

37:08.900 --> 37:11.009
and when the sergeant wouldn't abort the mission,

37:11.465 --> 37:12.884
Tommy killed him.

37:13.001 --> 37:14.795
- I don't know that.
- Oh, yeah, you do,

37:14.875 --> 37:17.691
and so does your sergeant, and I am here to tell you,

37:17.803 --> 37:20.492
the rest of your life is gonna be like A Christmas Carol,

37:20.563 --> 37:22.212
except without the happy ending.

37:22.376 --> 37:25.336
No, you just get to keep seeing ghosts at the end of your bed,

37:25.509 --> 37:27.061
and you want to know why?

37:28.244 --> 37:30.071
Not cause you have a gift,

37:31.362 --> 37:33.518
but because you have a conscience.

37:50.583 --> 37:51.497
Excuse me, ma'am.

37:52.169 --> 37:55.641
I just wanted to let you know that he was a good man, your husband.

37:56.997 --> 37:59.271
We were all very proud to serve with him.

38:00.004 --> 38:00.818
Thank you.

38:02.865 --> 38:04.110
Save me a seat, will you?

38:10.102 --> 38:12.875
I thought we agreed you being here wasn't such a good idea.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.320
I changed my mind.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.635
Don't go doing something you'll regret.

38:18.855 --> 38:20.565
His family deserves to know the truth.

38:20.651 --> 38:22.701
The truth? I'll tell you the truth.

38:22.752 --> 38:26.740
The truth is, you, me and half the guys in there'd be dead right now if it wasn't for me--

38:26.976 --> 38:29.485
if I hadn't had the guts to do what had to be done.

38:29.833 --> 38:32.178
And u know what else? He wouldn't've made it either.

38:32.264 --> 38:33.995
Sarge was a goner no matter what happened.

38:34.042 --> 38:37.168
So you tell me, what the hell difference does the truth make, huh?

38:37.297 --> 38:39.012
What difference does it make? Hey!

38:39.509 --> 38:41.844
You go in there, it's over. You hear me?

38:42.464 --> 38:44.137
Without me, you got nothing.

38:44.738 --> 38:47.092
No California, no surf shop.

38:47.416 --> 38:49.627
All you got is a little couch to sleep on

38:49.693 --> 38:52.555
until your sister gets so sick of your sorry ass she throws you out.

38:54.553 --> 38:57.158
Yeah, now, you think about that, Michael. Hmm?

38:57.485 --> 39:01.412
You think about that long and hard before you go in there and do something stupid.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.468
You're a loser, Michael.

39:12.225 --> 39:14.918
You're a loser, and you always will be.

39:15.401 --> 39:17.981
You think this changes anything? Huh?

39:18.210 --> 39:19.620
Makes you a hero?

39:20.843 --> 39:22.180
I'm no hero, Tommy.

39:23.957 --> 39:26.218
I'm just a guy I want to keep from going crazy.

39:53.373 --> 39:55.707
Better sit down. You're not gonna believe this.

39:56.198 --> 39:57.851
I'm at the hospital, right?

39:57.960 --> 40:00.646
Please don't ask me to go down there. You know how that turned out.

40:00.898 --> 40:01.768
No need.

40:02.022 --> 40:04.554
The wife regained consciousness. Just got her statement.

40:04.639 --> 40:05.721
It turns out you were right.

40:05.911 --> 40:08.030
The husband was having an affair with his assistant.

40:08.122 --> 40:09.519
So he set the fire?

40:09.765 --> 40:11.465
You're stepping on my punch line.

40:12.403 --> 40:14.415
He tells her he wants out of the marriage.

40:14.498 --> 40:16.734
Wife says fine, but she's taking the house and kid--

40:16.806 --> 40:19.919
only she didn't mean taking as in divorce-settlement taking.

40:20.020 --> 40:24.470
She meant taking as in where-I'm-going-you-can't-follow taking.

40:26.319 --> 40:29.039
So I gave the Army investigator your number.

40:29.121 --> 40:33.038
I mean, if they want to interview me again or they need me to testify.

40:33.124 --> 40:34.768
I told them you know where to find me.

40:34.838 --> 40:38.167
Okay, but why go anywhere at all? I mean, what's in California for you now?

40:38.397 --> 40:42.140
You mean since I outed my financial backer as a murderer?

40:42.868 --> 40:44.455
I really don't know.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.323
I'll figure something out.

40:46.401 --> 40:47.824
Well, figure it out here.

40:48.786 --> 40:51.756
"Here" is a nice place to visit.

40:52.032 --> 40:55.033
"Here" is a good place to come back to.

40:55.602 --> 40:56.658
"There's..."

40:58.050 --> 40:59.730
a good place to start again.

40:59.836 --> 41:02.134
"There's" a good place to...

41:03.091 --> 41:03.958
be new.

41:05.211 --> 41:07.140
You better call me. Okay?

41:07.234 --> 41:08.021
I promise.

41:12.769 --> 41:13.665
Allison.

41:15.256 --> 41:17.111
Next bus doesn't leave until tomorrow.

41:17.450 --> 41:18.308
Okay.

41:21.717 --> 41:23.864
Hey! I almost forgot.

41:24.857 --> 41:25.813
You were right.

41:26.147 --> 41:27.175
What else is new?

41:27.729 --> 41:28.589
About what?

41:28.713 --> 41:30.100
That house I took you to.

41:30.162 --> 41:31.036
The briquette?

41:32.124 --> 41:33.669
The wife started the fire.

41:33.928 --> 41:35.835
50-50 shot, just like I told you, right?

41:35.901 --> 41:36.946
Just like you told me.

41:37.524 --> 41:38.322
- Love you.
- Love you.

41:39.439 --> 41:41.487
See, I knew you were gonna say that.

41:41.707 --> 41:43.520
I can see the future.

41:43.607 --> 41:46.197
I'm a human marvel.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
