00:24.479 --> 00:27.231
Why am I so devoted?

00:29.734 --> 00:32.189
It is not in the family.

00:34.197 --> 00:39.536
My parents are quite distant.
Also opposed.

00:43.498 --> 00:48.207
But some people are just different.

00:48.336 --> 00:51.835
Some people are predisposed to believe.

00:51.965 --> 00:55.416
A type flash between their eyes.

00:58.555 --> 01:01.472
They are not afraid of eternity.

01:01.599 --> 01:03.888
They are familiar with it.

01:07.146 --> 01:11.358
And when they bind
with the soul of another...

01:11.484 --> 01:14.236
they consider that bond as sacred.

01:17.657 --> 01:20.492
I was always such a person.

01:21.244 --> 01:25.455
It did take a while before I realized it.

01:29.502 --> 01:33.167
If nuns take their vows...

01:33.298 --> 01:38.505
They go on the church floor are
and pray for strength.

01:41.681 --> 01:43.721
I've also done.

01:44.893 --> 01:50.267
And if it was up to me situated
would thus end the story.

01:52.150 --> 01:53.810
Joline?

01:55.361 --> 01:57.401
Carl, you can not see me.

01:57.530 --> 01:59.938
You look great.

02:00.074 --> 02:03.574
You can not come here.
That brings misfortune.

02:03.703 --> 02:05.909
Are you serious?

02:06.706 --> 02:10.371
Where is your flower?
- In my hand. That brings happiness.

02:10.501 --> 02:13.419
And because you're my daisy.

02:13.546 --> 02:17.330
I love daisies.
- I know.

02:17.467 --> 02:19.709
But now I'm crushed.

02:22.347 --> 02:24.672
I love so dearly.

02:39.572 --> 02:42.407
How are you?
- Excellent.

02:42.534 --> 02:47.575
Is anyone there?
- Yes, they are all waiting.

03:41.593 --> 03:46.338
What is it, Chicky?
- I want to talk to you about Love Army.

03:46.472 --> 03:51.597
Matt and Duey booked for
Space Ass Tour in Japan.

03:51.728 --> 03:54.764
Do you let your band to Japan?

03:54.898 --> 03:59.643
They had to. Where they can earn a lot
yen.

03:59.777 --> 04:03.858
You begged me if I wanted to book. You remember?

04:03.990 --> 04:09.779
Yes, I'm mad because they Rufus
the drummer, have preserved.

04:09.913 --> 04:13.862
If there is someone in the band?
- Sure. I.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.416
Hold me now do not be fooled.
- What do you mean?

04:17.545 --> 04:22.005
I have booked a whole band,
and not a person.

04:22.132 --> 04:27.340
But I'm a great bass player.
- Yeah, but can you sing?

04:27.472 --> 04:30.259
Not really.
- You sing in a shower?

04:30.391 --> 04:34.888
Jo, I'm a damn good one,
brilliant bass.

04:35.021 --> 04:36.563
I know too.

04:36.689 --> 04:38.978
Your say on the show?

04:40.276 --> 04:43.526
Have I promised this occur?
- Yup.

04:43.655 --> 04:45.232
Is it then?

04:49.285 --> 04:51.741
You're the Love Army now.

04:51.871 --> 04:54.445
Joline, you're the best.

04:56.084 --> 05:00.081
Are you guys still here?
- I still break.

05:00.213 --> 05:05.634
I flirt with your brother, but I'm not sure I've
success. I have success?

05:05.760 --> 05:08.465
Yes, you have some success.

05:09.264 --> 05:11.340
Jo, this picture is Carl.

05:11.474 --> 05:14.428
Say just about anything.
- Why not?

05:14.561 --> 05:19.353
He wants to make news photos
and not photographing food.

05:19.482 --> 05:21.439
Food is still news?

05:21.568 --> 05:26.028
Take that series over patties.
That there are so many.

05:26.155 --> 05:31.031
He wants to take pictures of important events.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.078
He is depressed all those souffle's.

05:34.205 --> 05:39.033
I give a birthday party for him. Are you?

05:41.004 --> 05:43.080
He acted only birthday?

05:43.214 --> 05:47.259
That was eight months ago.
He is there to now.

05:47.385 --> 05:51.134
Sean, you can not all the time
sit on the toilet.

05:51.264 --> 05:55.344
Nice of you that you Carl tries to cheer.

05:55.476 --> 05:57.765
He does it so often for me.

05:57.896 --> 06:03.138
I also have masses cool
friends to whom I can imagine.

06:03.276 --> 06:04.936
Here we go again.

06:05.069 --> 06:08.189
Meg, it is "in prosperity and adversity."

06:08.323 --> 06:13.198
Is that "until death do you part?"
Or "until long as it's fun"?

06:13.328 --> 06:18.832
Until death do you part.
- How long they will remain so, do you think?

06:18.958 --> 06:22.790
A few years.
- Forever, Meg.

06:22.921 --> 06:28.163
Some believe what they say.
And I 'forever' said.

06:28.760 --> 06:32.710
So I've pretty
despite it tomorrow is sold out?

06:32.847 --> 06:37.059
Did I say that you got free?
- Perfectly arranged.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.763
Wait for me.

07:29.070 --> 07:33.862
Hi, Jo. With Carl.
I remain still jut.

07:33.992 --> 07:37.989
I have to photograph a pancake breakfast.

07:38.121 --> 07:43.910
They understood here apparently
under photojournalism.

07:44.043 --> 07:49.251
Sorry, Jo.
I feel a little down.

07:49.382 --> 07:51.838
I have to be here by myself.

07:51.968 --> 07:56.262
I just wanted to let you know that I love you.

08:14.991 --> 08:19.653
Sorry, I'll call you up?
- Does not matter. What is up?

08:19.787 --> 08:23.038
Nothing.
- Where is Carl?

08:24.792 --> 08:31.246
You know how long Carl stays away?
You may continue but I do not live alone.

08:31.382 --> 08:35.510
Think you inmates
still awake?

08:35.636 --> 08:39.551
I do not know. Perhaps.

08:39.682 --> 08:42.138
Do they have anything in common?

08:42.268 --> 08:45.388
Yes, of course. Why do you ask?

08:45.522 --> 08:48.891
Because I in Jenny's bed can sleep...

08:49.025 --> 08:52.476
and then sleep with Jenny Mimi.

08:52.612 --> 08:57.523
Whether she dives but someone else
the suitcase.

08:57.659 --> 08:59.450
What do you mean?

08:59.577 --> 09:06.031
That they may sleep with whom she wants.
She is an adult. They may decide.

09:06.167 --> 09:12.455
She still does not sleep in your bed?
- No. Not every night.

09:12.590 --> 09:18.011
I never go to her room. She comes
always with me, I usually sleep all

09:18.137 --> 09:23.559
Then she comes to lie to me.
Sometimes it's nice to cuddle.

09:23.685 --> 09:26.602
She and Mimi are still a couple?

09:26.729 --> 09:30.430
That is true. I love Mimi.

09:30.567 --> 09:33.936
What I do not harm their relationship.

09:34.070 --> 09:38.447
What they have is pure,
sincere and honest.

09:38.575 --> 09:42.786
It is very pure.

09:48.126 --> 09:49.917
Do not look at me.

09:52.672 --> 09:56.836
Jo, you've already seen
Jenny's new design?

09:56.968 --> 09:59.637
I'm going to the market.

09:59.762 --> 10:04.259
It is really quite different than what is now for sale.

10:09.147 --> 10:15.315
Hi, Mimi. Good Morning.
Did you see who is there?

10:19.115 --> 10:22.733
She rats burden.
Carl chases they usually...

10:22.869 --> 10:27.614
but he is out of town on business.
Do not you, Jo?

10:27.749 --> 10:31.699
Why she is here.
- You want a cup of coffee, Mimi?

10:37.175 --> 10:43.094
Is that your wedding ring? That tattoo?
Has Carl also so alone?

10:43.223 --> 10:45.844
Carl has eczema.
- What?

10:46.100 --> 10:50.015
Eczema, a skin condition.

10:52.941 --> 10:56.392
Jenny has a wedding ring. Not True?

10:59.447 --> 11:03.990
Well, it's actually one ordinary ring.
He is in a safe.

11:04.118 --> 11:09.326
I did not know you were married.
This is intense.

11:09.457 --> 11:13.669
Unbelievable, right?
- Actually.

11:13.795 --> 11:19.798
I'm glad it's over.
I do not mean silly, Joline.

11:19.926 --> 11:24.635
What have I to do with it?
- You're married and that's nice.

11:24.764 --> 11:31.894
I tried marriage,
but it's not for me.

11:32.021 --> 11:35.058
Well for Joline,
another topic so.

11:35.191 --> 11:41.810
I have been married, and I do not think anyone
honestly wants to be.

11:42.907 --> 11:46.490
Because you were not really married.

11:46.619 --> 11:48.244
I told you so.

11:48.371 --> 11:52.784
You said you've tried it,
but that is not enough.

11:52.917 --> 11:56.618
You want it here
not.

11:56.754 --> 12:02.544
What did you say?
That your parents and my parents were not married?

12:02.677 --> 12:09.807
I do not say you were not married,
but you thought of something else.

12:09.934 --> 12:13.101
On what?
- Jenny, shut up.

12:20.361 --> 12:26.150
Listen, I do not stay, but thank
I could stay tonight.

12:26.284 --> 12:31.907
Sure?
- I want to be home when Carl comes.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.531
Are you sure you save you?
- And you?

12:34.667 --> 12:38.332
This is good, actually.

13:45.363 --> 13:48.566
Jo, I do not know when I return.

13:48.700 --> 13:53.160
First I think clearly.
Love, Carl.

14:18.521 --> 14:22.104
How do you respond to a breach of trust?

14:22.233 --> 14:25.898
Especially if it's your first?

14:26.070 --> 14:31.195
Love Army. And the song is called
Love Army Blues. Thank you.

14:32.869 --> 14:36.072
It is tempting to seek distraction.

14:36.206 --> 14:39.740
And you focus on your other commitments.

14:42.462 --> 14:47.836
You try to just do it.
And you pretend there's nothing wrong.

15:08.613 --> 15:14.283
It was delicious.
- All kits? Do you need anything?

15:15.203 --> 15:20.542
Another party would have
canceled. No, not Jo. I say that.

15:30.385 --> 15:34.596
Hi, Jo.
That cake looks delicious.

15:42.522 --> 15:46.105
A map of Carl? What he writes?

15:51.531 --> 15:56.656
I could not stay in New York.
Not only because of the work.

15:56.786 --> 15:59.704
It is definitely not you.

15:59.831 --> 16:06.035
I write you soon.
I am also sad. Love, Carl.

16:10.425 --> 16:12.583
State also where is he?

16:14.679 --> 16:20.183
"The pear cactus catches the last rays of." That says nothing.

16:21.060 --> 16:24.014
And the postmark is illegible.

16:45.043 --> 16:49.705
Tuck.
There are three kinds of chocolate.

16:49.839 --> 16:52.295
I think it will probably taste.

16:55.678 --> 17:00.886
This is good, Jo. Now at least you know what you have
to him.

17:01.017 --> 17:05.229
That burden off your shoulders
cases. A hairy load.

17:05.355 --> 17:07.560
I do have some dope for you.

17:07.690 --> 17:11.818
Everyone thinks I'm a dick.
But Carl is also a.

17:17.742 --> 17:21.443
Jo, come out.
- We are your friends.

17:21.579 --> 17:26.288
It's more fun here.
Do we come in?

17:26.416 --> 17:28.991
Now we come in, okay?

17:52.068 --> 17:54.393
All kits?
- What do you do?

17:54.529 --> 17:58.990
My car keys are still
in the car. Stupid, huh?

17:59.117 --> 18:01.193
That is Chicky's car.

18:05.081 --> 18:06.741
What are you doing?

18:12.797 --> 18:15.086
What I'm doing now?

18:15.216 --> 18:19.000
I can not think straight.

18:19.137 --> 18:22.506
And it goes not about, you know.

18:22.640 --> 18:27.053
I wanted to go to my mother
Long Island to kick the habit.

18:27.187 --> 18:30.638
If I had money,
I would go to.

18:30.773 --> 18:35.519
Then it would be fine.
I would get back on the right path.

18:38.156 --> 18:41.607
You never know how you find your faith.

18:41.743 --> 18:46.654
It can get through something ridiculous.
That's just it.

18:46.789 --> 18:52.246
Do not ask someone you trust
is worth. Trust to trust.

18:52.378 --> 18:56.672
Who are you doing it?
For them, or for yourself?

18:59.636 --> 19:04.096
Why are you?
- How much does it cost to Long Island?

19:04.224 --> 19:07.343
I do not know. $ 40 or something.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.848
This is not a joke, right?

19:21.491 --> 19:26.402
I had no idea whether he was going to rehab or not.

19:27.539 --> 19:33.659
But I just wanted to believe.
And that was a great feeling.

19:43.388 --> 19:47.172
I want to say something.
Can it down?

19:47.308 --> 19:52.848
You were just rather negative,
but I do not want to hear.

19:52.981 --> 19:56.100
I do not bullshit about my husband.

19:56.484 --> 20:00.102
Does anyone know where my husband is?

20:02.156 --> 20:07.993
He went to the west.
- I know that. Does anyone know anything more?

20:11.791 --> 20:14.709
This is a celebration,
now is danced there.

20:58.254 --> 21:03.379
What do you care where Carl is?

21:03.510 --> 21:08.800
I mean: Who is your example?
Mom and Dad in any event.

21:09.724 --> 21:12.678
Were behind our neighbors?

21:12.810 --> 21:19.857
Why an example? I do not know
surfer, I may therefore not surf?

21:26.241 --> 21:29.989
I think you all
very good picks.

21:30.119 --> 21:35.362
I think you're very special.
- Thank you, Jay. Me too.

21:41.339 --> 21:44.506
Jay, I'm married.
- Pardon Me.

21:44.634 --> 21:50.221
And I'm your sister.
- I know. That was really intense.

22:11.202 --> 22:17.490
Most relationships fail because
partners wait for something to happen.

22:17.625 --> 22:22.583
But if you want someone
stays with you, you should invest...

22:22.714 --> 22:25.750
even though they behave like an idiot.

22:28.970 --> 22:32.090
If I frugal would do...

22:32.223 --> 22:37.763
I had enough money to search two ordinary
or a big state.

22:37.896 --> 22:41.430
Everything was pointing in the direction
Texas.

22:47.488 --> 22:50.158
People know much more than they think.

22:50.283 --> 22:55.526
Sometimes you can get information
in a strange way.

22:59.375 --> 23:04.037
The postmark was illegible,
but I thought I saw five letters.

23:04.172 --> 23:07.623
And there are no cacti
in Idaho or Maine.

23:09.010 --> 23:14.301
And wanderers go to Texas
to get lost even more.

23:14.432 --> 23:16.341
Have you seen this man?

23:17.060 --> 23:19.551
That is a statistical fact.

23:22.941 --> 23:26.107
Probably because it is so big.

24:01.646 --> 24:08.064
A stranger in a desert is 5 times
scarier than a stranger in New York.

24:10.530 --> 24:13.780
I wish I could say
that is not true.

24:22.584 --> 24:24.208
I'll see you.

24:41.978 --> 24:44.647
Stay away from my purse.

24:57.911 --> 25:00.580
A slap...

25:08.129 --> 25:13.550
Mike, are you done with her?
Let's go. Come on.

25:13.676 --> 25:15.336
Jiffy.

25:25.980 --> 25:27.522
I've been coming

25:27.649 --> 25:32.643
Because you are so like Blondie,
do you keep her.

25:33.863 --> 25:36.615
Fuck.
- Wait for me.

25:36.741 --> 25:41.486
You're a dick.
- I was hard at work for you.

25:41.621 --> 25:43.910
I have rings for you.

25:44.040 --> 25:50.493
I want nothing from you. You're a dick.
- Wait. Just look at this ring.

25:51.464 --> 25:53.042
For you.

25:58.721 --> 26:02.422
Thank you.
- No thanks.

26:15.071 --> 26:17.147
Are you okay?

26:18.283 --> 26:20.074
Are you stuck?

26:24.706 --> 26:26.745
Can I have my purse back?

26:29.335 --> 26:32.539
Give her the damn bag now but.

26:35.633 --> 26:39.085
Let my arm loose. Release me.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.109
Where are you now?
- In Texas.

26:53.234 --> 26:57.943
How is it there?
- Quite intense.

26:58.072 --> 27:00.445
Interesting, but vehemently.

27:00.575 --> 27:03.944
I'll call you tomorrow, Meg. Bye.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.828
Pardon, go
use the discount coupons?

27:19.677 --> 27:21.670
With Joline from Room 1 01.

27:21.804 --> 27:24.474
Do you have a moment?
- Yeah, you know.

27:39.822 --> 27:42.989
That's okay. Thank you.

28:39.215 --> 28:42.216
You would think that I would fly off Carl.

28:42.343 --> 28:47.930
But something held me and said I had to give
man some space.

28:48.057 --> 28:50.762
That he was not ready for.

28:52.061 --> 28:58.811
That's the hardest one relationship.
You give partner space.

28:58.943 --> 29:01.517
How much space will be needed.

29:03.489 --> 29:06.443
You must rely on your feelings.

29:49.702 --> 29:51.280
What are you doing?

29:52.956 --> 29:54.616
Nothing.

29:56.834 --> 30:00.417
Do you bothering me?
- No, you know. Not at all.

30:00.547 --> 30:04.295
You arouses my interest.

30:13.059 --> 30:16.724
Do you want to drink a beer inside
?

30:18.857 --> 30:22.724
Well, come
I do with the beer out.

30:43.882 --> 30:46.503
Please.
- No, thank you.

30:54.017 --> 30:59.770
I called Niko, but you may also call me
Neil.

30:59.898 --> 31:02.852
Or what you want.

31:07.572 --> 31:13.195
I make things in newsprint and paper towel...

31:13.328 --> 31:16.661
and paint and glue, of course.

31:18.666 --> 31:21.122
That's obvious, right?

31:29.135 --> 31:34.093
I'm here drove
because I was looking for my husband.

31:34.224 --> 31:38.767
I wanted to know if it went well with him. I Shizu him.

31:41.147 --> 31:44.979
I want him to see me only
when he's ready.

31:45.109 --> 31:49.356
I will not tell your secret.
- Thank you.

31:50.865 --> 31:56.986
So you're married to that guy
who lives down the house?

32:02.126 --> 32:04.000
Precisely with him.

32:04.128 --> 32:05.706
You know him?
- No.

32:12.595 --> 32:18.598
Could you maybe just
want to come in my humble stulpje?

32:19.435 --> 32:24.263
It's a mess, but cozy.
It is a sexy mess.

32:26.192 --> 32:29.027
Again, I'm married.

32:29.153 --> 32:34.943
Shall I tell you something?
I think that is just so exciting.

32:35.827 --> 32:41.830
No, I really mean that.
Women who are devoted to their husbands...

32:41.958 --> 32:44.912
winds me enormously.

32:45.044 --> 32:47.500
Is not that weird?
- Yes, that's it.

32:47.630 --> 32:51.046
I know,
but I can not help it.

32:51.176 --> 32:58.590
Anyway, it's my problem.
I should keep it to myself.

32:58.725 --> 33:02.094
True.
- You hear me about it anymore.

33:02.228 --> 33:04.304
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:08.109 --> 33:10.185
Do you really want a beer?

33:11.988 --> 33:13.779
Come only.

33:40.058 --> 33:42.975
I'm Joline O'Neill Howell.

33:44.145 --> 33:47.728
I'm Carl's wife.
Carl Howell, the photographer.

33:47.857 --> 33:50.977
Course. Come in.

33:51.110 --> 33:56.187
I did not even pay attention
when Carl told me about you.

33:56.324 --> 34:00.701
Does not.
- I do not watch often. Sit down.

34:00.828 --> 34:04.363
So you are Carl's better half?

34:04.499 --> 34:10.418
This is my wife.
Since last June. Her name is Suzanne.

34:11.297 --> 34:14.880
She's beautiful.
She looks happy.

34:15.009 --> 34:18.958
I hope so.
Third time lucky, they say.

34:19.097 --> 34:24.471
Three times for her.
This is my first time. For me it's new.

34:24.601 --> 34:29.763
And for you it's the last chance.
- Congratulations.

34:29.899 --> 34:36.150
I did not know you came. I
Carl just before a session sent out.

34:36.281 --> 34:39.565
May I ask what he's going to shoot?

34:39.701 --> 34:45.869
The chili cook-off in Cornudas.
That's right anyway, eh Ben?

34:45.998 --> 34:49.331
Yes, a cooking competition.
- You're kidding.

34:49.460 --> 34:52.746
No, I thought not.

34:52.880 --> 34:56.214
Can you let someone else do not
?

34:56.342 --> 35:00.885
Carl does.
He will not disappoint me.

35:01.014 --> 35:04.180
I've noticed that he's eating well.

35:04.309 --> 35:08.805
I do not what to do.
I'm sure you understand your box.

35:08.938 --> 35:15.392
I would really just
tell how talented Carl.

35:15.528 --> 35:20.274
Carl would rather take pictures
about life and man.

35:20.408 --> 35:25.117
That kind of photos. He's at least
as well. Even better.

35:25.246 --> 35:29.659
Do you see that calf?
Carl would have highlighted that calf.

35:29.792 --> 35:35.463
These pictures are nothing compared to those of Carl. Not ugly intended.

35:35.590 --> 35:39.670
I mean, if these are your photos.
Are these your photos?

35:45.767 --> 35:49.765
I say this because Carl
currently struggling.

35:49.896 --> 35:54.854
And that cooking competition makes it even ten times worse.

35:56.027 --> 35:58.779
Thanks for the information.

35:58.905 --> 36:04.860
Carl is still in his probation.
Any information is welcome.

36:04.994 --> 36:07.450
I have to get back to work.

36:08.706 --> 36:13.084
Have I said too much?
- You have expressed well.

36:13.211 --> 36:19.130
Did I mention that Carl appreciates her work,
otherwise he would not do it.

36:19.259 --> 36:22.462
I will soon tell
that you've been through.

36:22.595 --> 36:25.169
Just do not.
- Whatever you want.

36:25.306 --> 36:29.055
Forget
but most of what I said.

36:29.185 --> 36:31.392
That will not happen.

36:31.521 --> 36:34.142
He is really good.
- You said that already

36:34.274 --> 36:36.183
Very good..

38:34.310 --> 38:36.980
Violence solves nothing.

38:40.900 --> 38:46.736
You must suppress your tendency to use violence to. Either way.

38:56.624 --> 38:58.166
Yes, boy...

39:57.602 --> 39:59.262
yet one more time.

40:25.338 --> 40:28.007
You block the car of my uncle.

40:32.846 --> 40:34.553
You battery is empty.

40:37.559 --> 40:40.595
I have no jumper cables. Do you?

40:42.272 --> 40:44.644
Are you a member of the roadside?

40:46.109 --> 40:52.028
Come on inside.
We then use my card. That they do not notice.

40:57.287 --> 41:00.288
I should have been on my work.

41:00.415 --> 41:03.369
But the others are always late.

41:15.221 --> 41:20.132
Is that Mexico?
- Yes, that is the limit. The Rio Grande.

41:20.810 --> 41:23.218
They put me on hold.

41:26.691 --> 41:33.228
You seem very nice.
- Thank you. You too. Sit down.

41:36.743 --> 41:40.740
You know Carl long?
- You know Carl, too?

41:40.872 --> 41:45.119
I met him a few weeks ago.

41:45.251 --> 41:47.327
How do you know Carl?

41:48.963 --> 41:50.623
I'm his wife.

42:01.017 --> 42:06.260
I did not know. I swear:
I had no idea.

42:06.397 --> 42:10.063
You have to believe me.
- I believe you.

42:10.193 --> 42:16.480
What a fucking mess. I sit back
stuck with a married guy.

42:19.077 --> 42:25.578
I did not know he was married,
but I knew in my subconscious?

42:25.708 --> 42:30.620
No idea.
- That should. This always happens to me.

42:31.839 --> 42:36.383
It has to do with
confidence. I've read.

42:38.137 --> 42:41.803
I've done a banana in your tank.

42:42.350 --> 42:46.430
Yesterday I made a banana
in your tank. Pardon Me.

42:46.563 --> 42:50.181
What's the effect?
- I do not know.

42:54.696 --> 42:58.195
Damn, T-Bo.
I give you no key.

42:58.324 --> 43:00.531
He was here yesterday.

43:00.660 --> 43:06.414
How should I respond?
- Do What U Want. None of your business.

43:10.753 --> 43:13.458
What do you think of that reaction?

43:15.425 --> 43:20.252
Sorry, Carmen.
I will never do anything, you know.

43:20.388 --> 43:25.264
But I jerk that guy's New York
entrails from his body.

43:25.393 --> 43:29.260
The New York fucking guts
of that bastard.

43:37.280 --> 43:40.945
What did you say?
- Nothing.

43:42.160 --> 43:45.992
You should have said something.
- Nietes.

43:46.122 --> 43:50.286
Say something.
Come on, Carmen. Say something.

43:50.418 --> 43:53.834
I have to tell you anything.

43:53.963 --> 43:58.709
That's not possible.
- Yes it is, T-Bo.

43:58.843 --> 44:03.304
I have to tell you anything.
Absolutely nothing.

44:06.976 --> 44:12.315
But we felt something for each other.
You can not deny.

44:26.246 --> 44:32.580
I'm awfully fond of you,
but I swear I love you.

45:03.783 --> 45:07.448
Okay?
- Yeah, nothing wrong.

45:07.579 --> 45:13.368
Is that your husband?
- Man? He is not even my friend.

45:13.501 --> 45:16.953
I am eight times with him
slept.

45:17.088 --> 45:21.335
Carmen, listen.
There is something wrong with that boy.

45:21.467 --> 45:26.094
You should see him go and finish.

45:26.222 --> 45:28.262
I do not know where he lives.

45:28.391 --> 45:33.848
He always comes to visit me in
the restaurant when he is in town.

45:33.980 --> 45:37.645
Does he know where Carl lives?
- No idea. How So?

45:37.775 --> 45:44.277
Because he New York guts
Carl will tear out. For That.

45:44.407 --> 45:47.242
Do you worry about Carl?
- Yup.

45:47.368 --> 45:51.448
I'm mad at him,
but he does not die.

45:54.918 --> 45:59.330
Would I want this guy Carl
guts ripped out?

45:59.464 --> 46:01.207
Absolutely.

46:01.341 --> 46:05.588
I learned a side of Carl
know that I did not like.

46:07.388 --> 46:15.016
But who has promised to protect him
in prosperity and adversity?

46:15.813 --> 46:20.310
At that moment I wished that it had been another.

46:20.443 --> 46:24.488
But that was not the case.
I promised.

46:26.908 --> 46:31.071
How long will you be here this time
?

46:31.204 --> 46:35.332
No idea. I want to know if he
morning goes to work.

46:35.458 --> 46:39.586
Why would he do that?
- I want to be sure.

46:52.934 --> 46:58.972
Can I tell you what I do with you
would do if you were to break your vow...

46:59.107 --> 47:02.476
and I would go to bed?
- Come on, Neil.

47:02.610 --> 47:07.735
I'm not saying I do, but I want to tell
only.

47:07.866 --> 47:10.820
Sure? It's awfully sexy.

47:11.786 --> 47:15.866
You do not have to say.
Think just a moment.

47:15.999 --> 47:21.585
Okay. Good. Do your eyes closed.
- Forget it.

47:21.713 --> 47:25.331
Just do it simply.
I do you no harm.

47:44.861 --> 47:46.652
What do I do?

47:49.949 --> 47:56.153
I do not know, but you can
'd better stop it.

48:04.631 --> 48:11.677
I ask if you want to quit
with what you're doing.

48:15.225 --> 48:17.846
Why do not open your eyes?

48:20.021 --> 48:22.975
I do them open when you quit.

48:55.223 --> 48:59.007
Have you told Carl that T-Bo?
- Yup.

48:59.143 --> 49:01.681
I also said that I'm
no longer wanted to see.

49:01.813 --> 49:08.065
I do not know if he has been given the story about
T-Bo. Can be.

49:08.194 --> 49:10.068
Did you tell that I was there?

49:10.196 --> 49:12.818
Should it?
- No.

49:13.616 --> 49:17.484
How was work?
Does he have his job?

49:17.620 --> 49:20.740
We have not talked about his work. How So?

49:20.874 --> 49:22.534
So only.

49:23.710 --> 49:28.336
Incidentally,
your brother this morning called.

49:28.464 --> 49:32.925
I gave him your number.
That you do not mind?

49:33.052 --> 49:35.674
No, we have nice chat.

49:35.805 --> 49:40.597
He said when I had to call?
- He called me.

49:40.727 --> 49:44.060
He asked what I thought of this state.

49:47.317 --> 49:51.895
What did you say?
- I said you've seen Carl...

49:52.030 --> 49:56.490
but Carl yours yet.
And we both found strange.

49:56.618 --> 50:00.152
Carl is not yet ready.

50:00.288 --> 50:05.080
We both found it
it all comes from one side.

50:05.210 --> 50:08.495
That's not true.
- Do you want those chips yet?

50:08.630 --> 50:14.549
I would expect that he would support me if I
thing going through.

50:14.677 --> 50:16.587
Really?
- Of Course.

50:16.721 --> 50:23.258
You do whether it's a spiritual thing.
If he comes from Tibet. Sit down.

50:24.437 --> 50:26.643
I've never been in Tibet.

50:26.773 --> 50:30.473
What do you do now you wait until
Carl is ready for it?

50:30.610 --> 50:33.777
Go to him only spy?

50:33.905 --> 50:37.523
Spy  I'm not.
I like him in the eye.

50:37.659 --> 50:39.735
I protect him.

50:41.162 --> 50:44.745
What are you doing this afternoon?
- How Come?

50:44.874 --> 50:47.709
I want you to meet someone.

50:54.384 --> 51:01.265
I never understood anything of that hocus-
pocus. Although it's in my blood.

51:01.391 --> 51:05.887
But you are different.
You do have a predisposition.

51:06.813 --> 51:09.055
Day Grandpa.

51:19.242 --> 51:23.026
This is my girlfriend, Joline.
Joline, this is Cinco.

51:23.162 --> 51:28.370
They may call you anyway Cinco?
- They call me whatever she wants.

51:28.501 --> 51:30.909
It is an honor to meet you.

51:31.045 --> 51:35.672
Carmen told me of your special gifts.

51:35.800 --> 51:39.169
She needs help, Grandpa.

51:39.304 --> 51:42.554
She has problems with her husband.

51:44.809 --> 51:49.851
Carmen said that your wife
also had special gifts.

51:49.981 --> 51:53.646
And you know her secrets.
- I was not there.

51:53.776 --> 51:56.564
Now I get a moment's peace.

51:56.696 --> 52:00.314
Everyone wants me to solve all sorts of things.

52:00.450 --> 52:02.941
I brought Pepsi.

52:06.122 --> 52:08.613
Then get a few glasses.

52:12.837 --> 52:14.629
You live here pretty.

52:18.635 --> 52:25.136
There's a rattlesnake in that vessel.
Take him at once. I miss him.

52:25.266 --> 52:27.555
A real rattlesnake?

52:27.685 --> 52:30.889
I have bewitched him.
Do not worry.

52:58.925 --> 53:02.210
Do not. Put the lid back on.

53:07.517 --> 53:11.265
Do not fool her.
- Who does that?

53:11.396 --> 53:16.638
She has confidence in me.
That even my grandchildren.

53:16.776 --> 53:18.685
Do not start again.

53:22.615 --> 53:26.993
Stop that. And you also get
no Pepsi me.

53:29.122 --> 53:31.791
Come here. Sit down.

53:44.846 --> 53:46.470
Blow once.

53:50.977 --> 53:52.637
Again.

54:09.412 --> 54:11.618
This may take a while.

54:15.627 --> 54:18.960
Everyone knows what they mean rituals.

54:19.088 --> 54:23.964
No one needs to give meaning
to something, because it is already there

54:24.093 --> 54:27.961
It's already
before you are born.

54:28.097 --> 54:34.515
The sky is blue and the house is pink.
That goes for you and for me.

54:34.646 --> 54:41.644
That house is not pink,
previously salmon.

55:03.591 --> 55:08.300
I'm going inside.
Call me if you need me.

55:08.429 --> 55:11.347
Thanks. Bye.
- See you, Neil.

55:15.603 --> 55:19.981
How did you find me?
- Carmen has brought me.

55:24.028 --> 55:28.904
I like that you are there,
but I can not go out with you.

55:29.033 --> 55:35.154
Listen, Jo. I think you should come home and this should
caps.

55:35.290 --> 55:37.247
I really mean that.

55:37.375 --> 55:39.996
Hi, my mother made it.

55:40.128 --> 55:46.166
Thank you. This is my brother, Jay. Toby
lives in the pink salmon-colored house.

55:46.301 --> 55:47.961
Hello, little Toby.

55:48.094 --> 55:53.385
We were just here to talk.
I'll soon be here with you.

55:53.516 --> 55:55.972
Thank your mother for me.

55:59.355 --> 56:04.397
Carl
I can honestly pretty...

56:04.527 --> 56:07.528
but I do not know whether he is worth it.

56:07.655 --> 56:10.656
Does it matter whether he's worth?

56:10.783 --> 56:14.366
Suppose Carl his both legs
had lost.

56:14.495 --> 56:18.244
Should I dump him
for someone with good legs?

56:18.374 --> 56:23.499
I have eternal loyalty to him promised
in front of you and God.

56:23.630 --> 56:27.295
He is not in a wheelchair.
I mean...

56:27.425 --> 56:31.886
That's an analogy.
He is mentally in a wheelchair.

56:33.181 --> 56:35.968
He is mentally in a wheelchair?

56:39.229 --> 56:43.558
You do not understand and I can not identify you.

56:43.691 --> 56:47.356
So it seems better that you leave the car.

56:47.487 --> 56:52.730
You're my brother and I love you.
But you must get off.

56:58.456 --> 57:00.081
I'm in Texas.

57:13.221 --> 57:16.305
Sometimes it is very heavy. Then
difficult to persevere.

57:18.977 --> 57:22.974
It helps to talk with someone who understands the.

57:24.524 --> 57:27.062
How do you do that?
- What?

57:27.193 --> 57:29.565
His bite is deadly.
- Not for me.

57:29.696 --> 57:34.322
I carved all with fangs
in my skin when I was little.

57:34.450 --> 57:37.736
The first time I made a small scratch.

57:37.871 --> 57:42.200
The second time I scratched harder.
It started to bleed.

57:42.333 --> 57:46.248
The third time yet again louder, etc..

57:46.379 --> 57:51.207
Some let them bite immediately.
- Who still die?

57:51.342 --> 57:53.880
Some do, indeed.

57:54.012 --> 57:59.254
But those who continue to live
be snake charmer.

57:59.392 --> 58:04.731
They immediately get a reward.
And immediately force.

58:05.899 --> 58:11.141
I do not. I must have patience,
because I'm not that brave.

58:11.279 --> 58:15.905
I would like to call not brave, but stupid.

58:16.034 --> 58:19.403
You can view it from two sides.

58:30.006 --> 58:35.047
Here, I've done it in lime.
- Awesome. Thank you.

58:36.554 --> 58:40.552
Now they suddenly do not want
talk to me, you know.

58:40.683 --> 58:45.144
Why I'm the bogeyman?
Why are these anyway?

58:45.271 --> 58:51.357
You have to wait and see. It makes no sense
to put her under pressure.

58:51.486 --> 58:55.069
Waitress is that my margarita?

58:55.198 --> 58:58.531
I'm worried about her.
- I know.

58:58.660 --> 59:01.411
It's sweet of you
that you worry.

59:01.538 --> 59:08.703
You have a nice family.
And so spiritual. That's you also fixed.

59:12.382 --> 59:17.459
You think not that I mentally
is in a wheelchair or something?

59:18.888 --> 59:24.049
Do you think of me?
- No, no, absolutely not.

59:24.686 --> 59:26.928
Can I now my margarita?

59:27.480 --> 59:29.307
I'll be back.

59:36.823 --> 59:38.946
There she is.

59:45.123 --> 59:49.417
Would they see us?
- So what? It's a car.

59:49.544 --> 59:52.082
True. You are right.

59:52.213 --> 59:56.626
I do not give her the idea
we spy on her.

59:56.759 --> 01:00:00.259
But we still do?

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:07.847
No, we fit just fine on her.
That's something else.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:13.852
You see that?

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:17.231
Row something through.

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:20.697
Then she sees us.
- A little bit.

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:33.585
It seems Joline though.

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:36.548
True. And that is that man.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:42.547
Do you think she looks?
- No, I think not.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.254
Why not?
They can see everything.

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:50.386
Joline takes her promises
pretty seriously.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:55.943
If you only watch,
break your promise not? Even So?

01:00:56.069 --> 01:01:01.858
Is there whether he knows she looks.
- How so?

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:06.119
If he knows she looks, she
plays a role at all.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:11.750
But if he does not know, it's like he
plays with herself.

01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:16.622
And that's okay, acceptable.

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:21.916
OK,
but suppose he knows she looks?

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:25.469
But they do not know that he knows that she looks.

01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:30.391
So she thinks she just
is watching. Very innocent.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.190
Because it all comes from one side.
If you are watching a movie.

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:42.771
It is. But if he knows that they
watching.

01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:47.403
And she knows that he knows that she looks...

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.079
... then

01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:59.873
Man, that's another intimacy.
- You got that right.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:43.061
You can not always remain.

01:03:48.741 --> 01:03:51.659
This gives a lot of protection, right?

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:53.660
Better I have not.

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:10.554
What is it?

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.924
Very strange.
- What's strange?

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.682
You remind me of my wife.

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:21.055
That is indeed strange.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.517
You should do the following.

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:28.939
You break him in.
I do not care how.

01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:31.909
I help him recover.

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:51.379
You leave everything untouched.
Show respect for things.

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:04.602
You put the sand in places you
expects him get hurt.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:11.697
In places where you expect
that will be something to him.

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:17.945
Use your common sense.
Do not be economical. I've had enough of this stuff.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:53.237
I did not think you'd see me.
- What are you doing here?

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.193
I rest for a while.

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:57.900
Why pour mud everywhere?

01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:02.534
It is sacred sand.
It protects you from T-Bo.

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.161
Who?

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:08.872
Carmen told me that she had told you.

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:11.711
How do you know Carmen?

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:18.296
Carl, I did not think you'd see me. I wanted to give you space.

01:06:18.433 --> 01:06:21.268
Jo, you must see.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:23.935
Later, Toby. Good?

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:30.103
About Carmen. Am I hurt? Yup.
Am I evil. Yup.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:33.819
We will have to work hard at it...

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:37.993
but I blame her anything.
She even my girlfriend.

01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:43.992
She is very nice. And she has something
with Jay. My brother is also here.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:55.044
I feel quite a bit
panicky, Jo. I'm sorry.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:58.713
I understand that.
That was not my intention.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.348
Does not matter.
It's all my fault.

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:09.310
I have not been honest and therefore
I have now that panicky feeling.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:15.979
The you also surprised to see me here
and to see how I live...

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.653
and where I live. I understand that.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:24.455
I try to explain it in a letter. I have two versions.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:34.372
Have you ever loved someone, Jo...

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:37.794
with your whole heart and soul?

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:45.978
And then one day you notice
they all suck your happiness.

01:07:46.104 --> 01:07:49.888
They did not mean to.
It was just the way.

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:55.730
Suddenly something good happens.
You hope it, because you're talking needed.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:08:02.531
You feel that you're drowning and you
needed something to go by.

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:05.497
And then you see something good come down on you.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:07.865
It comes right at you.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:12.828
And if you want to grab it,
it goes to another.

01:08:12.964 --> 01:08:15.420
It looks like a bad joke.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:19.298
Suppose that another does not.
Would I get lucky?

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:25.051
I do not know, but my feeling
says maybe it is.

01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:29.977
You mean I bring you happiness?
- It may sound strange.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:33.640
But I realize that I made a mistake somewhere.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:37.560
Because everything went well,
until something changed.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:42.073
I realized only after a long time,
because I loved you...

01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:45.701
I completely lost the thread.

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.828
That marked you as well?
I saw you saw it too.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:54.122
I had nothing to look at you, Jo.
Absolutely nothing.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:58.170
You made constant fun stuff.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:02.212
And you had all earned.

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:04.719
But where was I? Nowhere.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:10.389
And that meant?
I had to leave to get things done.

01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:15.645
That was the only way to
no longer get lost.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:19.644
And I feel that I am now not far from.

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:24.407
Go, sit.
I want to show you something.

01:09:24.536 --> 01:09:28.663
Who took this photo?
Frontpage, eh?

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.450
And this?

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:33.584
And this? Carl Howell.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:39.915
My boss believes in me.
I do not eat since Monday to do more.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:44.001
Since last Monday?
- Starting Monday, yes.

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:49.678
And he will not return whistle me
I feel it. And you see this house?

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:56.608
This is a house of Casa Homes,
with option to buy. And I think about it.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:10:01.028
But this is only a small part.
- Which?

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:07.906
From the step I make.
Do you understand what I mean?

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:11.987
You understand best,
because you're smart enough.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:18.412
I assumed that you understood me
and that meant a lot to me.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:26.129
I feel that I have said enough.

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:40.730
I have the feeling that you only have to go. okay?

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:46.113
I can not stand
that you stay longer.

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:11.237
It could be worse than
spiritual sitting in a wheelchair.

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:15.118
Some people are mentally in a coma.

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:18.118
If you're married to someone like...

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:21.750
is your vow
tested to the limit.

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:29.760
Well, Jo. I was not very clear,
I know.

01:12:29.888 --> 01:12:33.553
I'm going to work
to express myself better...

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:40.184
But this makes no sense. Let me
by myself clear. Come on, Jo.

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:48.405
You need a license
to park there.

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:52.743
It is Mexican territory.
They are very strict.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:59.156
They often come along. It looks
or remote, but that's not it.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:01.748
And that pile of my fence.

01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:07.211
It's my wood. From me.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.970
From grandfather I learned how you could keep a vigil.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:18.303
How to cleanse one's mind.

01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:27.234
He said not much, but I was
convinced that I could do it.

01:13:27.362 --> 01:13:30.232
Some things I had seen him.

01:13:30.365 --> 01:13:32.737
Other things I made myself.

01:13:33.493 --> 01:13:39.578
If a wake Carl not brought to his senses
, I would not know what does.

01:13:54.973 --> 01:14:01.260
More spiritual people know immediately that you are one sacred mission.

01:14:01.396 --> 01:14:06.223
They understand the situation immediately
and they keep their distance.

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:14.942
But you also have people who do not
understand where you're doing.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:25.537
Because they have never seen the bigger picture.

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:42.266
I looked again. Did you see it too?
- Yeah, it's crazy.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:44.933
Jo, you saw that shooting star?

01:14:49.903 --> 01:14:55.359
Is Carmen there now?
Is that your Volkswagen, Carmen?

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:59.074
Fuck you, Carl.
Go back inside.

01:14:59.204 --> 01:15:03.248
Are you Jay?
Did you 'fuck you' to me?

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:06.459
Yes, it's me, Jay. Fuck you.

01:15:06.586 --> 01:15:11.331
No, get yourself Fuck you, Jay.
Do you know why?

01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:15.416
I do not even talk to you.
I'm talking to Carmen.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:19.717
Fuck you, Carl.
- That said Carmen. Did you hear that?

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:24.310
Can you cared
what my neighbors think of this?

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:29.146
They think you're a bunch of squatters.

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:32.027
What you say is yourself.

01:15:40.203 --> 01:15:46.621
In the desert can change people
in other beings.

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:49.207
In a fox or a crow.

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:53.879
Carl had turned into an asshole.

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:57.792
I had to make my rituals
more extreme.

01:15:57.929 --> 01:15:59.637
Is that your husband?

01:16:01.266 --> 01:16:03.424
Well, you know.

01:16:11.025 --> 01:16:15.937
I would be quite a bit more time to spend with your...

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:21.493
but it feels a bit strange
because your husband right in the neighborhood.

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:24.110
I mean, right across the street.

01:16:24.831 --> 01:16:27.073
It just feels weird.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:34.838
Tomorrow I'm going to Toronto. I try
there to sell some of my work.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:39.046
But then I come back here again.

01:16:42.891 --> 01:16:46.306
I wish that you fit on my monkey.

01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:50.813
I usually make pinatas
but he is not.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.894
You should not smash him.

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.070
Take care of yourself.

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:06.828
How do you know when you've gone too far
?

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:12.867
Sometimes you'll get clues...

01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:16.622
But you'll be too busy with your rituals...

01:17:16.758 --> 01:17:20.043
and not you see those signs.

01:17:22.347 --> 01:17:25.798
You have again broken with me, huh?

01:17:25.934 --> 01:17:29.184
I wonder why my window was broken...

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:34.555
and then I find eggs under my bed.
Yes, yes. Eggs.

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:40.944
Six, I do not know how they get there,
fucking raw eggs.

01:17:44.244 --> 01:17:47.494
This is far, Jo. Even for you.

01:17:47.622 --> 01:17:51.406
I'm concerned.
I'm really worried about you.

01:17:51.543 --> 01:17:55.042
I wanted to let you know.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:18:01.541
Should something happen, then you need
understand that you left me no choice.

01:18:24.909 --> 01:18:27.827
Enter. Give back.

01:18:30.874 --> 01:18:33.032
So it came.

01:18:34.586 --> 01:18:36.911
Why I recorded.

01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:49.552
Tell me what that man means to you.

01:18:49.684 --> 01:18:51.427
He is my husband.

01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:55.393
Exactly, yes. And you protected him?

01:18:56.941 --> 01:19:02.528
Against one T-Bo, if I'm not mistaken. And he's your husband?

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:05.277
No, he is not.

01:19:08.203 --> 01:19:11.785
Excuse me,
I read it wrong.

01:19:11.915 --> 01:19:19.210
It's good to find out what
these men mean to you...

01:19:19.339 --> 01:19:22.340
if we have a little more time.

01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:26.844
Hopefully writing in your journal
helped you.

01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:30.969
I think so.
- Good. I'm glad.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:36.391
But maybe I should
a larger dose of medication.

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:47.863
The medications we give, we do not give
for fun.

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:53.532
Who knows, help them to see things differently. That's why I get them anyway?

01:19:53.665 --> 01:19:56.749
No, why do not we give them to you.

01:19:56.876 --> 01:20:00.791
We are not on a fast result from here.

01:20:00.922 --> 01:20:05.383
We do not look here for an easy way out.

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:11.264
Far too many people are looking for an easy way out.

01:20:11.391 --> 01:20:16.812
Hopefully you learn to break that pattern.

01:20:19.607 --> 01:20:24.400
I felt like I told a joke that no one understood.

01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:29.025
But I kept him tell
because I thought it was a good joke.

01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:33.988
And now I sit between
misunderstood people.

01:20:34.122 --> 01:20:36.577
Can I ask you something, Adelle?

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:43.705
Is it ever bother you that no one else in the moon
believe?

01:20:50.638 --> 01:20:55.384
Maybe the good is if I stay here just long enough.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:05.307
Adelle, you take those pills still in?

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:33.545
I should just surrender.

01:21:34.641 --> 01:21:36.349
Emptying My spirit.

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.638
Feel Nothing more.

01:21:42.732 --> 01:21:44.357
Go to sleep.

01:22:09.843 --> 01:22:11.502
That's better.

01:22:15.473 --> 01:22:20.265
It's time to get out of here.
Take a deep breath and then we go.

01:22:20.395 --> 01:22:21.853
I can not.

01:22:22.814 --> 01:22:27.025
Do not know what I did?
- I heard.

01:22:28.695 --> 01:22:32.775
Then you know so that I'm too sick to go.

01:22:34.576 --> 01:22:37.826
Maybe you were not sick enough.

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:42.415
Maybe you need some poison...

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:46.587
to be able to live without
death along with us.

01:22:51.426 --> 01:22:54.842
You have a rare power.

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:58.138
It's not that you did not have power.

01:22:58.266 --> 01:23:03.936
But if you rise from the dead
verdriedubbel your strength...

01:23:04.063 --> 01:23:06.934
sometimes even quadrupled.

01:23:10.445 --> 01:23:14.941
You could use it here,
but it is too limited.

01:23:16.201 --> 01:23:19.201
That would be stingy.

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:25.416
Go now but.

01:23:28.213 --> 01:23:30.252
Take your shoes.

01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:34.130
I'm going to talk to this girl.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:20.919
If you do not say, I put you
silence, mister Kakentoe.

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:25.722
I had you immediately have to beat up
when you came here.

01:24:25.854 --> 01:24:30.314
I should have overwhelmed
as an avalanche of shit.

01:24:32.235 --> 01:24:35.734
Carl, I'll talk about our marriage.

01:24:40.201 --> 01:24:41.826
It's over.

01:24:42.245 --> 01:24:44.451
I realize now too.

01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:47.914
I've tried.
Really tried.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.958
But I do not go on.
I'll get over it.

01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:56.007
I may be someone who is committed.

01:24:56.509 --> 01:25:00.377
But I feel disconnected from you.

01:25:08.062 --> 01:25:14.397
You can delete tattoos.
It takes a long time and it hurts...

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:19.236
but ultimately you are left with a white spot.

01:25:23.161 --> 01:25:26.281
Has T-Bo you done that?

01:25:26.414 --> 01:25:32.749
No, I'm out of a car cases.
- A moving car?

01:25:34.631 --> 01:25:40.550
It was a Jeep. I watched
not well and I fell out.

01:25:42.639 --> 01:25:44.927
I hope it heals quickly.

01:25:48.269 --> 01:25:49.977
Goodbye, Carl.

01:26:26.182 --> 01:26:28.756
I'm still committed.

01:26:28.893 --> 01:26:34.314
I have talent for.
Some people just have that.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:41.355
If you do not look up the extremes
how can you be absolutely sure?

01:26:42.198 --> 01:26:46.990
How do they know what they really
, or what they stand for?

01:26:49.038 --> 01:26:51.197
From El Paso?

01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:53.788
Or where others stand for?

01:26:58.298 --> 01:27:00.586
That remains a mystery.

01:27:17.567 --> 01:27:19.191
Beer?

01:27:44.928 --> 01:27:47.169
You have dogs, I see.

01:27:49.265 --> 01:27:51.305
Bill, Sheila, kitchen.

01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:58.266
I came back to pick up my shower radio.

01:27:58.399 --> 01:28:02.018
I have myself but admitted.

01:28:02.153 --> 01:28:04.905
Coming from El Paso purpose here?

01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:09.907
I do not live in El Paso,
I live in New York again.

01:28:10.036 --> 01:28:16.205
Everything came there one bit
a dead end, not only in terms of work.

01:28:16.334 --> 01:28:21.494
I had the feeling that I no longer knew who I was.

01:28:21.631 --> 01:28:24.122
I knew you knew it yet though.

01:28:24.259 --> 01:28:27.959
I had a wrong step put
in my life.

01:28:28.096 --> 01:28:32.094
I felt that I did something...

01:28:32.225 --> 01:28:36.009
why I came back.

01:28:37.105 --> 01:28:41.648
And I'm back again.

01:28:55.623 --> 01:29:00.618
It's just a reflex.
I sit today in karate.

01:29:00.753 --> 01:29:04.834
You can quite nice.
- You OK? Really?

01:29:04.966 --> 01:29:10.636
It felt good to me.
- Really? Fine.

01:29:10.763 --> 01:29:15.141
I just came by to see
or was okay with you.

01:29:15.268 --> 01:29:17.261
It's fine with me.

01:29:17.896 --> 01:29:22.771
See you then. Thank you.
I will give you back your key.

01:29:28.948 --> 01:29:31.190
Take care of yourself, Carl.

01:29:48.176 --> 01:29:52.256
Wholeheartedly.
- It was a beautiful ceremony.

01:29:56.851 --> 01:30:01.347
Joline, unbelievable
that you've caught the bouquet.

01:30:01.481 --> 01:30:05.265
You threw it right at me,
exactly in my eye.

01:30:05.401 --> 01:30:07.524
Sorry.
- Does not matter.

01:30:07.654 --> 01:30:12.031
I did because you have inspired us.

01:30:12.158 --> 01:30:16.405
We met at your campsite.

01:31:03.501 --> 01:31:07.285
I took champagne for you.
- Thank you.

01:31:09.924 --> 01:31:15.001
Did I mention that I
chocolate to have you in my car?

01:31:15.138 --> 01:31:17.130
And a poem.

01:31:17.265 --> 01:31:19.258
A poem?
- Right.

01:31:19.392 --> 01:31:22.975
I want to soon nominate you.

01:31:23.104 --> 01:31:29.771
You're not going to be obscene?
- No, of course not. Come on.

01:31:31.654 --> 01:31:34.441
But if you want, I do it, though.

01:31:34.574 --> 01:31:37.990
You can be quite persistent.

01:31:38.119 --> 01:31:40.740
As is worth...

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:48.792
There are always people who dare
it to make a big jump.

01:31:48.922 --> 01:31:54.876
They jump off a cliff with all
what they have and hope 's best.

01:31:55.011 --> 01:31:57.336
What can you say about them?

01:31:57.472 --> 01:32:00.841
Are they stupid or brave?

01:32:01.809 --> 01:32:03.849
Are they crazy?

01:32:03.978 --> 01:32:08.640
Or they may themselves very lucky?

01:32:09.817 --> 01:32:14.278
That's again something you can see from both sides.
