11:23.516 --> 11:26.727
So... how you feeling
about your group show tonight?

11:27.103 --> 11:30.940
Huh. I feel... vulnerable?

11:31.899 --> 11:36.904
My name is actually attached to this work.
The street campaign is like my alter ego.

11:36.987 --> 11:41.242
It was created out of my assault,
and the thought of being judged on my art

11:41.325 --> 11:43.244
never really crossed my mind
with that work.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.288
Would you feel less vulnerable
if you had included your street art

11:46.372 --> 11:48.082
in the-- in the group show tonight?

11:48.165 --> 11:49.125
Maybe.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.628
<i>My Name Isn't</i>
is what brought me here. Well...

11:52.711 --> 11:56.715
I mean, the assault. But I feel like
I've moved on from that pain.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.260
-You feel like you can move forward?
-Maybe.

12:00.177 --> 12:03.305
Well, we want to make certain
that we can or should.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.224
Your street campaign is powerful.

12:08.811 --> 12:12.481
What are, uh...
What are your expectations for tonight?

12:12.565 --> 12:16.527
This group show...
is an amazing opportunity

12:16.610 --> 12:19.196
that could shoot me off
in the right direction.

12:19.864 --> 12:24.702
A serious turning point for me.
And I want it to put me on the map.

12:25.202 --> 12:29.874
Put me in a place where I can talk
about my art with other artists.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.627
I want it to lead to some serious sales.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.255
I want to see my work hanging on the walls

12:36.338 --> 12:40.968
of Jay Z, Michelle Obama, Oprah!

12:41.051 --> 12:42.261
[chuckles]

12:43.095 --> 12:45.431
Basically, there's a lot at stake
for me tonight.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.185
I could be on the street
the next time you see me.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.980
Crazy girl on the street
making crazy street art.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.231
Here's what I'm seeing.

12:55.566 --> 12:59.653
Nola Darling has moved on
from the <i>My Name Isn't</i> work,

12:59.737 --> 13:01.280
which is fine, fine.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.200
But I think that you haven't
fully embraced it.

13:04.283 --> 13:08.787
First, because there is, understandably,
some negativity attached to it.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.707
And then,
because there's a slight chance of,

13:11.790 --> 13:14.168
and I don't want to call it a problem,

13:14.251 --> 13:16.587
but of something triggering
the assault again.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.380
-Does that make sense?
-It does.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.299
Yes, something to think about, okay?

13:21.383 --> 13:22.259
Thank you.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.304
If you start to panic, just...
use your tools.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.975
I hope you can make it!

13:32.394 --> 13:34.605

[Zora] When I was a little girl
growin' up in Snow Hill, Alabama,

18:37.699 --> 18:40.994
every Saturday morning,
my mama used to drag me into the kitchen

18:41.078 --> 18:43.956
to get my hair done with a hot comb.

18:44.039 --> 18:49.086
Every Saturday morning,
she burned my scalp with that hot comb,

18:49.169 --> 18:50.420
and I'd take off running.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.340
I still have the scars on my forehead

18:53.423 --> 18:56.552
to prove that she would burn
the heck out of me.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.719
So, I become...
