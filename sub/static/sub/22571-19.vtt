00:01.335 --> 00:03.171
- Welcome to Torrance.

00:03.204 --> 00:04.472
It's close to the beach.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.706
Big buyers are here.

00:05.739 --> 00:06.874
I think we have to park
in there.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.309
*

00:08.342 --> 00:09.377
- You don't want
to park right here?

00:09.410 --> 00:10.511
- Oh, no.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.912
- We're gonna park
right out here.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.013
- Well, then you know
what you're gonna do?

00:13.047 --> 00:14.014
- No.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.249
- You're gonna
carry my luggage.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.584
- It's a tampon, babe.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.718
- And you know,
while you're at it,

00:17.751 --> 00:18.886
I got a lipstick
you can carry.

00:20.254 --> 00:23.291
- This is not how you show me
that you love me.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.694
That's love.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.932
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:31.965 --> 00:34.302
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:34.335 --> 00:35.803
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:35.836 --> 00:37.805
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.140
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.474
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:40.508 --> 00:42.176
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:42.210 --> 00:43.711
- You shut your face.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.879
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.047
- We're back, baby!

00:50.751 --> 00:53.154
- Today I'm headed
to an auction in Torrance.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.655
You know, I'm looking
forward to this place.

00:54.688 --> 00:55.956
It's all interior units.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.459
And right now it's prime swap
matin' season.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.461
I make a lot of money
at swap meets.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.463
So right now I need
some good lockers.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.965
And everybody knows
who's the king of swap meet.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.134
Right, Violet?

01:07.268 --> 01:08.302
I'm the king.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.670
*

01:09.703 --> 01:10.704
- Damn, brother.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.839
Wha

01:11.872 --> 01:13.174
- Caramel Frappuccino.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.677
- Aw, man, you know fat people
love caramel, man.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.712
That  looks sexy.
I ain't gonna lie.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.948
- Brandi!
What kind of drink is that?

01:20.981 --> 01:23.284
- Yeah.
What you sipping on, girl?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.418
- Tea.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.254
How you doing?

01:26.287 --> 01:27.488
How you doing?

01:27.521 --> 01:28.822
*

01:28.856 --> 01:30.258
- Almost had it.
- Almost had it.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.959
- Almost turned the corner
right there, Dave.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.761
- Yup!

01:35.363 --> 01:36.897
Freakin' hot out here.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.299
What's up, Dave?

01:38.332 --> 01:40.468
Oh, you spiffin' yourself up?

01:40.501 --> 01:41.502
- Dog hair.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.737
- Hey, little peach!

01:43.771 --> 01:46.174
You're really cute.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.808
- That's my girl, man.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.444
- He can just come
with me today.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.079
- What's your budget today,
Kenny?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.148
- I'm going about like 700.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.983
- 7! Oh.
You're flush today, huh?

01:56.016 --> 01:57.785
- Yeah, I got
a little paper chain.

01:57.818 --> 01:58.919
- Damn.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.856
Anything, or you just trying
to outbid everyone else?

02:02.890 --> 02:04.225
- Oh, both.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.194
That's so mean.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.928
- You just come,

02:07.961 --> 02:09.697
and you just
outbid everybody.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.832
I can't do it.
It's not in my spirit.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.833
- Try it today.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.368
You'll be me, okay?

02:14.402 --> 02:16.036
Just try the "yup."
Let's see how it works.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.005
Yup.
- Yup.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.473
Yup.
- Yup.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.908
- Yup.
- Yup.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.443
Yup.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.811
- No, no, no, no.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.579
- If Mary wants to learn
the way of the "yup,"

02:25.613 --> 02:27.548
then she's found her sensei.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.483
Sick 'em. Sick boss.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.651
- Ah!

02:30.684 --> 02:32.386
I ain't got no kibbles
and bits, brah.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.422
What's up?
What's up

02:34.455 --> 02:35.489
Kumbaya.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.291
He know a dog lover
when he see one.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.559
- Yup.
- Me and him

02:38.592 --> 02:40.194
got the same kind of eyes.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.731
- Aw. That one's kind of cute,
actually.

02:43.764 --> 02:47.335
They don't always take on the
character traits of the owners.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.637
- Sometimes your enemies come
with smiling faces.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.140
- And Laura smiles way too
much for me.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.141
- Ah, welcome to the auction.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.142
Before you go things just get,

02:55.175 --> 02:56.176
you need to know the rules.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.177
Gonna go to the unit,

02:57.211 --> 02:58.212
we're gonna remove the lock,

02:58.246 --> 02:59.213
we're gonna give
you five minutes

02:59.247 --> 03:00.214
to take a look around.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.615
- See who our lucky buyer is.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.717
- You can't go inside.
You can't open any boxes.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.553
And whosoever got the most cash
in their pocket

03:05.586 --> 03:06.920
you can own it today.
Are you ready?

03:12.926 --> 03:15.563
- All right,
welcome to Torrance!

03:15.596 --> 03:17.197
Here we go!

03:17.231 --> 03:18.899
*

03:21.869 --> 03:24.638
- NordicTrack.
Is that the rowing machine?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.039
- Yeah, I think so.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.241
- That's fancy.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.709
What is that?

03:28.742 --> 03:31.279
- Those are, um, glass panels.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.346
- You, like, put 'em together.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.647
It makes like
an accordion door.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.082
I like those doors.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.286
And "accordion" to me,
I'm bidding on 'em.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.520
- Artwork.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.954
Office equipment.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.624
There some old beach toys
over here.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.159
There could be some trinkets
in here that I could sell.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.962
- You got some fine, fine
artwork there.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.331
Office boxes.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.732
I'm not too excited.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.167
The only thing I like
is the Plexiglas.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.404
And I don't even know
what it's for.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.905
- I heard Plexiglas.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.307
The only place I see Plexiglas

03:59.340 --> 04:01.742
is in Jack In the Box
in the hood.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.877
Hard to order tacos
through there, you know?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.613
- And here we go, number 20.
What's your pleasure?

04:06.747 --> 04:07.715
- 200.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.117
- Mary.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.685
Throw a "yup" out there.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.853
- Yup.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.827
- I got 225.

04:19.860 --> 04:20.828
Did you just flip me off?

04:20.861 --> 04:22.296
- Yes.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.931
Yes, I did.
- Do it again then.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.566
I dare ya.
- Mary.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.567
Yup.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.568
- Yup.

04:28.769 --> 04:29.870
- Oh, gosh.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.272
300?
Put 300 down?

04:32.306 --> 04:33.807
Thank you, Brandi.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.576
Thank you for being
so honorable with that.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.346
325, 325?

04:38.379 --> 04:40.948
- Come on, Mary.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.049
- Yup.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.587
Going twice.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.490
- Mary, 325.

04:49.523 --> 04:53.494
- Looks like the student
has become the teacher.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.629
Yup.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.698
- All right, this way,
this way, this way, folks.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.368
- All right,
let's see what we got here.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.702
Piece of artwork.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.637
So for the canvas alone,
50 bucks.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.638
*

05:04.672 --> 05:06.139
Some kid toys, 5 bucks.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.307
*

05:07.341 --> 05:10.778
Oh, an old stereo turntable.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.946
It's clean, classy,
and it's cool.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.148
50 bucks for this thing.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.283
Little cabinet.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.851
10 bucks for that.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.520
These are cool,
these old jewelry boxes.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.821
I like these.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.122
5 bucks for that.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.525
Another 5 for this.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.827
Look, an old NordicTrack.

05:26.860 --> 05:30.030
I'm gonna say 40 bucks.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.031
Cute.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.566
Little, uh, tables

05:32.600 --> 05:34.835
for eating
dinner and such.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.404
10 bucks for these.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.773
Okay, rolodex.
Here we go, now. Vintage.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.209
You always hear about people
going through your rolodexes.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.777
Well, here we go!

05:43.811 --> 05:45.479
So this, 25 bucks.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.415
What is this?

05:47.448 --> 05:49.417
Oh, it is cool though.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.818
Portable lamp.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.821
Yep, this little sticker
right here, that's vintage.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.322
50 bucks for this thing.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.459
It looks like maybe this is
an office room divider.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.862
So I'm gonna put 150 bucks
on this thing.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.363
Here some jewel boxes.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.132
Oh! A ring.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.735
But
diamond's missing.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.438
Still, 20 bucks for that.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.874
Another little suitcase.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.543
Oh, cool!

06:15.576 --> 06:17.445
!

06:17.478 --> 06:19.947
Bakelite, small bracelets.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.214
These are awesome.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.316
So '70s. Cool.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.252
These jewelry boxes are good.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.120
Ooh, Berlin.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.822
These look pretty old.

06:28.856 --> 06:32.526
The design alone is awesome
and, like, mid-century modern.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.994
So chic.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.830
I think maybe I should get
this stuff checked out.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.600
I usually don't think twice
about plastic jewelry,

06:39.633 --> 06:42.035
but this stuff is cool.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.304
Mid-century modern galore.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.039
Smells like money.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.813
- All right. Come on, 10x15.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.014
Here we go!

06:54.047 --> 06:57.317
That's what I'm talking about!

06:57.350 --> 06:59.787
*

06:59.820 --> 07:02.623
- Tools, a bike.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.757
Some ladders.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.826
Best one I've seen today.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.995
- Shop-Vac, dolly.

07:08.028 --> 07:11.499
I like this--this old
check box, which is good.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.133
- This is a mystery, though.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.902
Babe, look at those boots.
Look at those boots.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.506
- Those are mine.
Mid-highs.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.608
- Those might fit you, Kenny.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.409
If you're not feeling
like full-on cowboy,

07:22.442 --> 07:23.944
those are half boots
when you're feeling like

07:23.977 --> 07:25.112
half the time.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.549
- The cowboy, he just go
"How" not "Howdy."

07:28.582 --> 07:30.518
I'm gonna bid on this here.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.985
- We got some tools.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.487
There's some baseball cards.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.123
An old school horse racing
game back there.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.891
There could be
some vintage treasures,

07:37.925 --> 07:39.426
and stuff I could
do refurbs with.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.329
So this locker's looking
pretty good.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.831
- All right, if you're ready
to go, I'm ready to go.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.000
Thomas, 200.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.739
I got 200. How about 250

07:51.772 --> 07:53.507
300, 300 there. 350 down.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.075
350, go 400?

07:56.944 --> 07:59.747
450.

07:59.780 --> 08:03.183
500. 550 600

08:03.216 --> 08:05.152
600 there. And 650 now?

08:05.185 --> 08:06.654
What about 700?

08:06.687 --> 08:07.621
- Yup.

08:07.655 --> 08:08.856
- 700, 700.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.223
- Let me ask, how you doing,
Mary?

08:13.426 --> 08:14.828
- Yup.
- Whoo!

08:14.862 --> 08:17.565
775

08:17.598 --> 08:20.734
825? 825 going once.

08:20.768 --> 08:21.735
- Yup.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.973
850 going once,
850 going twice.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.075
Last time I'm gonna call
at 850.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.711
Sold it to $825, Dave.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.112
*

08:32.145 --> 08:34.081
- They never had a chance.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.549
- Boo.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.753
- All right, folks.
Come on now, E29.

08:39.787 --> 08:40.788
- Come on, Kenny.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.355
Let's go see who
we can beat up on.

08:42.389 --> 08:45.325
- That speech was on his mind.
He don't care.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.027
So I'm gonna be following
his blueprint.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.164
Let's go to the dark side.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.801
It's a beautiful thing,
you know, the dark side.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.336
- Come on now.
Here we go.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.739
All day long!

08:58.772 --> 09:01.208
*

09:01.241 --> 09:02.342
- Lots of boxes.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.111
Which I look for always

09:04.144 --> 09:05.613
'cause it could
be trinkets galore.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.314
Looks like some furniture
right there

09:07.347 --> 09:10.283
that I could restore
and do stuff with.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.686
You know,
this is a possibility.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.022
- Yup!
- Dave!

09:15.055 --> 09:16.824
Nope!

09:16.857 --> 09:18.425
- Hidden bottle water cooler.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.994
Oh, I like that.
You think it's in there?

09:21.028 --> 09:22.696
- Mm-hmm. Sleeping bags.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.531
- Mm-hmm.
- All those records.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.299
- Yeah, good ones too.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.701
- This is a decent unit.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.337
- Boxes! And more boxes!

09:30.370 --> 09:32.039
They got records.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.741
I like collecting records.

09:33.774 --> 09:37.410
But this here
is kind of...calling my name.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.179
Meatball warmer-upper.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.883
- Look at this TV with a VCR
"combo-nation."

09:42.916 --> 09:45.853
Some deer heads.
I mean, it's a pile.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.755
But it's got to be
a cheap pile for me.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.389
If not, I'm not interested.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.691
- I kind of like this unit.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.692
- Okay.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.927
- Yup! Yup!

09:53.961 --> 09:56.163
Yup!
Yup!

09:56.196 --> 09:57.430
Yup!

09:57.464 --> 09:59.667
- I got a great idea.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.169
- Everybody say "yup"
when they bid to now.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.570
- Ew.
- Just on this one unit.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.405
- Jarrod doesn't always
have the best ideas.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.574
And this one is no exception.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.842
- I go "yup."
Then you go "yup."

10:08.876 --> 10:11.044
Then you go "yup" like quick.
Bang, bang, bang.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.512
- All right and if you're ready
to go, I'm ready to go.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.881
And here we go: how much money,
what's your pleasure?

10:13.914 --> 10:15.415
What are you gonna pay

10:15.448 --> 10:16.449
- Yup!

10:17.584 --> 10:18.551
- Yup!

10:19.953 --> 10:21.321
- There you go.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.589
- Yup!

10:22.622 --> 10:24.157
- Yup!

10:24.191 --> 10:25.793
- Yup!

10:25.826 --> 10:27.060
- Yup!

10:27.094 --> 10:28.395
- Oh.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.097
Oooh.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.464
- Thanks, guys.
Thanks.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.766
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.567
- Yup!

10:34.601 --> 10:36.269
Yup!

10:36.303 --> 10:37.604
- I don't even want
this locker,

10:37.637 --> 10:39.206
but if they're gonna use
my "yup,"

10:39.239 --> 10:40.774
they're gonna have to pay.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.209
It's trademarked, after all.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.178
- Yup!
- 250.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.914
- Yup!

10:46.947 --> 10:48.081
- Yup!

10:49.917 --> 10:51.318
- Yup!
- I got 325.

10:52.619 --> 10:53.653
- Yup!

10:53.687 --> 10:54.855
350.

10:54.888 --> 10:55.856
- Yup!

10:55.889 --> 10:57.624
- Yup!

10:57.657 --> 10:58.692
- Yup!

11:00.660 --> 11:01.795
- Yup!

11:01.829 --> 11:04.397
450.
475

11:04.431 --> 11:05.833
475?
Show 'em how you do it.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.801
475 going once,
Show 'em how you do it.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.937
475 going once,
475 going twice.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.873
Last time to call it 475 bucks.
Sold it your way.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.207
You got it for $450, Jarrod.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.743
Berrp.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.244
I don't know about you,

11:17.277 --> 11:19.780
but I feel like
I need a shower.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.248
- Thank you, folks.
That's the end of the sale.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.349
And don't forget
to pay the lady.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.583
God bless!

11:23.616 --> 11:25.753
- Man, I can't believe
I ain't get nothing.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.921
I guess I got a little
distracted today.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.656
But maybe if I'm sneaky,

11:29.689 --> 11:31.658
I might could learn something.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.894
Where Dave at?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.095
- All right,
this the money maker.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.129
- Mm-kay.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.031
- Oh, hold on a minute.
- Oh.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.067
- This is something you don't
see all the time.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.569
Is it cassette tapes?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.738
Is it tapes?
Is it cassette tapes?

11:44.772 --> 11:46.740
- Silverware.
- Ooh.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.241
These look like real silver.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.943
- All right.
200 bucks.

11:49.977 --> 11:50.944
*

11:50.978 --> 11:53.180
Yeah, bro.
Canister.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.883
Don't open it, Brandi.
Okay, go ahead.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.284
Release the toxins
into the air.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.187
- We will ask
the questions here.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.823
- We will ask the questions.
- Oh, my God.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.524
You know what that is?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.259
My Halloween costume.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.529
You're so gross.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.866
- Movie time popcorn maker.
- 10 bucks.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.202
LaserDisc.
Get ready for the mother lode.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.837
You're the mother.
That's the lode.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.939
Oh, I got the LaserDisc player
right here.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.108
So with the LaserDisc,
like 300 bucks.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.110
- Okay.
This is it, Jarrod.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.711
Oh!
Yeah, man.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.213
The smokin' banana.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.615
- Look at his eyes.
.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.518
Babe, this water cooler
is actually pretty nice.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.787
It's probably worth 100 bucks
by itself.

12:33.821 --> 12:36.523
PlayStation 1.
20 bucks.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.092
- These are all Disney,
and they're all full.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.461
I say we got a 150 bucks
here, J.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.729
- Coming out.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.397
- Oh, look at this thing.
This is nice.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.099
It's clean.
I think it's brand new.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.101
Probably get like 50 bucks
for this polaroid camera.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.503
- Whoo.
We got three Crock Pots.

12:50.537 --> 12:51.872
- I'm gonna say we could
probably get--

12:51.905 --> 12:53.807
both: 25 bucks.
- ch.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.676
Look at this thing!
- That is amazing.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.711
- 10 bucks.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.047
Pressure cooker.
10 bucks.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.514
- Ooh.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.984
Did I ever tell you one
of those blew up on my mom?

13:06.053 --> 13:08.755
- Yeah, 10 bucks,
pressure coor.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.890
- Whoo!

13:09.923 --> 13:11.791
Brandi was skeptical
about this locker.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.227
But once again, I was right.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.930
What the ?
Brandi.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.465
- I don't know.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.967
It just fell out the bottom.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.302
Do you want to see this?
Check this  out.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.072
Oh, my God.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.074
What is it?
- Maybe...

13:27.107 --> 13:28.775
Keep the chemicals out
of your ears.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.744
I don't know.

13:31.778 --> 13:35.715
- It's like a survival thing
from WWI?

13:35.748 --> 13:37.817
- It looks like suspenders.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.223
- I don't know that is,
but it's old.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.525
And I definitely think we
should get this checked out.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.962
- Bong tokes.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.197
*

13:50.230 --> 13:53.266
- I'm gonna see
what my $825 bought me.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.635
Everybody won their locker
using my "yup."

13:55.668 --> 13:57.470
But nobody got
a better locker than me.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.738
Love these jackets though.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.673
Man, these are nice here.
Look at that.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.342
50 bucks right there
all day long.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.610
*

14:03.643 --> 14:04.978
Let's see what's in here.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.446
Ooh, look at that.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.680
Coach name brand.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.616
That's 200 bucks right there,
baby.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.884
*

14:10.918 --> 14:12.085
- Tony Lama.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.955
That's 100 bucks on those
right there.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.557
I've sold boots
to up to 400, 500 bucks,

14:17.590 --> 14:19.026
believe it or not.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.660
Pressure shower, 10 bucks.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.062
*

14:22.095 --> 14:24.031
Dead bolt, 5 bucks.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.099
Fire extinguisher, 5 bucks.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.134
*

14:28.969 --> 14:30.237
Somebody down there?

14:31.838 --> 14:33.140
- No.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.545
- Yeah.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.080
- Well, generally you got
to pay to see,

14:40.113 --> 14:42.015
but if you want to be
my apprentice for the day.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.451
- I need to learn something.
- All right, well, come on in.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.086
I'm tired
of being the teacher.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.154
But if Kenny wants
to stick around

14:47.187 --> 14:49.056
and move all
my heavy boxes,

14:49.089 --> 14:50.357
that's fine with me.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.992
This is Creme de Silk.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.761
This guy probably went and paid
$200, $300 for that shirt.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.096
- Yeah, at least then.
- I don't know.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.697
It's so ugly,
it's probably cool.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.132
- How much you think
the Creme--

14:59.166 --> 15:01.301
- Those are 250 bucks.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.303
You know anything about bikes?
- Nah.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.039
- I'm gonna say, like,
125 bucks on that bike.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.540
- Man, this is nice.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.209
- One of those monopoly things.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.843
That's 200 bucks right there.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.513
Red Wing shoes, baby.
- Size ten.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.015
- That's a easy $100
right there.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.649
When you look in here--

15:16.683 --> 15:18.751
Snap-on tools, which
is the best you can get.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.853
Here's another Snap-on
right here.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.256
So there's 70 bucks
in that drawer right there.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.291
Damn.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.558
- Lord, help me.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.561
There's probably $300
in that drawer.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.163
There's another
couple hundred bucks.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.332
And the toolbox alone
is 200 bucks.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.566
Now, that's a knife
right there.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.901
- Yes, indeed.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.369
- There's another knife.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.071
There's another knife.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.939
Now, that's a knife.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.941
both:
There's another knife.

15:41.975 --> 15:45.545
- More knives.
Seven, eight, nine,

15:45.578 --> 15:47.014
I'm gonna say I got a easy,
like,

15:47.047 --> 15:49.582
800 bucks worth of knives
there.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.551
- That dude's living
like Daniel Boone.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.653
- This locker was better
than I thought it would be.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.188
And I didn't even
have to pay Kenny.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.423
- My man.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.191
- Let's go get lunch.
My guys will load it up.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.459
- All right, now.

15:59.492 --> 16:03.263
Let's get some gefilte fish.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.298
- We're meeting Bob Chatt

16:05.332 --> 16:06.333
at Vintage Productions.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.668
- To find out how much Jarrod's

16:08.701 --> 16:10.770
Halloween costume
and weird pants are worth.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.106
- This one, this is
your basic Russian gas mask,

16:13.140 --> 16:15.508
probably 1970s, 1980s vintage.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.776
- Okay.
- This is the kind of stuff,

16:16.809 --> 16:19.212
if you put it on,
I'm really sorry.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.413
- Huh.
- You think it's clean.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.748
You think it's dry.
You put it on again.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.383
You start sweating,
and it reactivates the gas.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.452
And it will get stuck
in the pores.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.886
- I don't know
what he's talking about.

16:26.919 --> 16:29.156
I feel fine.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.923
- In the late '90s
when the wall fell,

16:30.957 --> 16:32.159
there was two companies
here in the U.S.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.260
that just bought out
pretty much

16:33.293 --> 16:35.228
the entire Russian military.
- Huh.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.496
- And then these
were brought in.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.598
They were sold as collectables
and as souvenirs.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.168
- This is the canister
that would have been filled

16:41.201 --> 16:42.902
with gauze and charcoal.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.671
You hook it up right
into the mask itself.

16:44.704 --> 16:45.938
- Okay.
- Then you hook it up

16:45.972 --> 16:47.540
into the canister,
you unscrew it,

16:47.574 --> 16:50.943
and that's all they did to
protect soldiers from gas.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.412
And this is exactly what
I thought it was going to be.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.281
- Yeah, they're like
weird pants.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.716
- Right here out the side.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.385
See?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.887
- This is a Soviet Union
horse gas mask.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.355
Is that right?

17:02.389 --> 17:04.057
- 'Cause the Russians were
still using horses

17:04.091 --> 17:05.392
for combat all the way up
until the '90s.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.693
- Wow.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.528
- So this would go on
the snout of the horse,

17:08.561 --> 17:10.363
and this would go back
over the horse's ear.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.931
These are the filters
on the side

17:11.964 --> 17:13.500
in case of a gas attack.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.001
- That's not gonna be
comfortable.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.671
- So, now that you've seen
everything,

17:18.705 --> 17:20.140
what do you think it's worth?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.475
- Gas mask, in that condition,

17:22.509 --> 17:24.211
$25.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.778
It's just so
very, very common.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.080
This is military only.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.648
Well, and a few
weird fetish sites.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.016
This...

17:30.049 --> 17:32.051
is great
for military collecting.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.453
It looks like
it's never been worn.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.288
The rubber's still very supple.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.789
I would say it's about...

17:38.425 --> 17:39.926
375.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.728
- 400 bucks.

17:41.761 --> 17:42.829
Appreciate your time, man.
- Thank you.

17:42.862 --> 17:43.830
- Appreciate all
the information.

17:43.863 --> 17:44.964
- Thanks.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.002
- I've invited my friend,
Charles Phoenix...

17:50.036 --> 17:51.771
What's up, pussycat?

17:51.804 --> 17:54.874
AKA the Ambassador
of Americana,

17:54.907 --> 17:57.410
to check out my plastic
Bakelite jewelry.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.249
That's what we're gonna
find out right here.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.683
Real Bakelite...
- Okay

18:03.716 --> 18:06.753
- Is like the gold of plastic.

18:06.786 --> 18:10.323
It was invented
about 110 years ago

18:10.357 --> 18:13.393
by a guy whose name
was Leo Baekeland.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.027
- Oh, okay.
- So he named it after himself.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.996
- Cool.
- We should test

18:17.029 --> 18:17.997
some of these pieces...
- Okay.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.132
- To see if they're real.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.234
Do you have 409?
And a Q-tip will do it.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.436
- Yeah.
- So if we spray a little 409

18:23.470 --> 18:25.572
on the Q-tip,
if you rub it a little bit

18:25.605 --> 18:26.939
and it turns yellow,

18:26.973 --> 18:29.242
that means you've got Bakelite.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.111
If there's no yellow,
sorry.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.913
- Moment of truth,
if it turns yellow,

18:33.946 --> 18:36.149
I'll be makin' some green.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.617
- So here we go.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.086
We're gonna rub it a little bit
on the inside.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.455
Rubbity, rub, rub,
rub, rub, rub.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.157
And then...

18:44.191 --> 18:45.892
Oh, look. It's yellow.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.126
Can you see that?
- Yeah.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.497
- So that is genuine,
authentic Bakelite.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.998
both: Yes.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.634
- I would say this is $195.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.935
- Yes!
- Really nice detail.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.170
- Oh, my God.
- And then

18:57.204 --> 18:58.671
you've got these bangles.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.873
These, I mean,
all together like this,

19:00.907 --> 19:03.376
they're great colors,
they've got a great patina.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.012
I would say probably about 150
for all of these.

19:06.045 --> 19:09.216
- Yeah. We all love color.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.050
Oh, look at this.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.353
Now, this is
an unbelievable piece.

19:13.386 --> 19:16.623
Okay, this is major.
This is real.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.558
This is--
- Yes! Okay.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.660
- I wouldn't sell it off my
neck I were you

19:20.693 --> 19:22.895
for less than about $300.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.697
- Awesome.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.766
- Oh, look at that.

19:26.799 --> 19:29.736
That's the other thing.
Bakelite has a sound to it.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.638
- Oh.
- It has a musical.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.506
Hear that kind of harmony?
- Yeah.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.607
- Totally.
- Yeah.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.609
This is definitely Bakelite.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.077
This is really rare.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.179
Red is super desirable.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.215
And then this mustard accent.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.917
- I would say, on this one...

19:44.951 --> 19:46.886
You could probably get 350.

19:46.919 --> 19:47.954
- Yeah.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.389
- Wow.
- I know.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.391
- I can't believe how much
my Bakelite's worth.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.793
This plastic is fantastic.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.762
- Pure plastic gold.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.430
- Cha-ching.

19:57.464 --> 19:58.731
male announcer:
Dave Hester proved

19:58.765 --> 20:00.400
that he's still the master.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.670
- Yup!
- Banking almost $1,800.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.506
Mary Padian turned
her plastic into paper,

20:06.539 --> 20:09.409
taking home 1,100 big ones.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.678
Jarrod and Brandi rode
into battle

20:11.711 --> 20:14.481
and came out with 875 bucks.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.450
While Kenny Crossley
ended the day...

20:17.484 --> 20:20.553
Longing for something sweeter.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.054
- Damn, brother.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.423
I'm about to cry.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.924
That actually looks sexy.
I ain't gonna lie.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.559
- Kenny's all over here

20:26.593 --> 20:28.495
undressing my coffee
with his eyes.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.530
- I got a lack of caramel

20:30.563 --> 20:31.764
in my system right now.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.401
You want to be selfish
with your "cappichamo"

20:34.434 --> 20:36.969
Caramel Floppy--
whatever you called it.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.237
What did you call that?
Flappa

20:38.271 --> 20:39.572
- Yeah, Flappichano.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.641
- Vapichano.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.675
- Brandi,
get me a Flappichano!
