11:44.737 --> 11:46.534
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'II, I'll take it.

11:46.605 --> 11:49.096
Great. Let's get you to the register
before the storm comes.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.405
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:55.414 --> 11:56.813
Twister is a-comin'.

11:58.984 --> 12:00.212
Daisy?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.116
Thanks.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.018
Why is there a mall pretzel in the bag?

12:08.394 --> 12:10.487
Oh, we assume that's where
you'd be going next.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.059
That is really offensive.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.798
- I can take it out if you want.
- No.

12:16.202 --> 12:19.933
But just for the future,
just, like, know that that is offensive.

12:20.606 --> 12:21.766
- Do you want dipping sauce?
- Yeah.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.016
I am so glad that we're doing this.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.788
It's so important that
we get out of the city, right?

12:39.859 --> 12:41.520
We can catch up and, you know,

12:41.594 --> 12:43.824
remember that Manhattan isn't
the whole world.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.630
- Isn't it, though?
- Yeah.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.131
(LAUGHTER)

12:47.199 --> 12:48.359
You're so funny.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.867
Totally, I've missed you guys so much.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.500
Me too. Natasha, are you still dating Jeremy?

12:53.405 --> 12:55.464
No, it turned out he was,
like, a total sociopath.

12:55.741 --> 12:57.606
- What happened?
- We were watching the entire season

12:58.043 --> 12:59.305
of <i>Game of Thrones</i> together, right?

12:59.378 --> 13:01.243
That's sweet, and then he goes
and he watches one without me.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.173
Just watched it without you?

13:04.250 --> 13:05.547
- Oh, yeah.
- No.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.519
Total sociopath. I read an article about
a book about that once, okay?

13:09.021 --> 13:10.454
You are so lucky you got out.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.492
Uh, Amy, how about that architect
you were dating?

13:13.926 --> 13:16.588
What's it like to fuck an architect?
Seems like it'd be better.

13:17.096 --> 13:20.623
Yeah, it is, it is better, but, uh, we broke up.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.466
Because I am sorry to say

13:23.536 --> 13:26.596
that Martin was, like, a textbook borderline.

13:26.839 --> 13:28.534
- I'm so sorry.
- What textbook?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.005
So I'm a fucking liar, Abby?

13:34.046 --> 13:36.606
- No.
- For your information... Hi.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.741
For your information, we were,
like, perfect in the beginning.

13:39.552 --> 13:43.648
Everything was, like, amazing,
and then out of literally nowhere,

13:44.490 --> 13:47.584
he was, like, crazy late
to my pre-birthday party.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.526
Wow. Oh, wow. I'm so sorry.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.296
And I was like, oh,
you're trying to destroy me.

13:53.632 --> 13:56.430
It's like that Jesus saying,
"Do unto others on your birthday

13:56.502 --> 13:57.969
"like you would have them
treat you on your birthday."

13:58.270 --> 14:01.933
Yeah, it's like, live every day
like it's your last birthday.

14:02.541 --> 14:07.274
Dance like no one knows
it's your last birthday.

14:07.880 --> 14:12.078
And, oh, also, he called the Internet
"the interwebs."

14:12.518 --> 14:14.213
Oh, please. (SCOFFS)

14:14.286 --> 14:16.345
So he was obviously on the spectrum.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.256
- Which spectrum?
- Fuck you, Abby!

14:19.725 --> 14:22.558
Are you Lee Patton Oswalt?
Why don't you back the fuck up?

14:22.628 --> 14:23.822
Are you trying to destroy me?

14:24.263 --> 14:25.628
No, I am not, Amy.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.928
Um, anyway, I totally met somebody.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.129
- That's nice.
- Yeah, yeah, it is nice.

14:30.502 --> 14:31.662
Where'd you meet him?

14:31.737 --> 14:34.729
I pretty much just followed and unfollowed
him on Twitter until he finally noticed me.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.107
Oh, my God, are you fucking Amélie?

14:37.176 --> 14:39.269
That's the most adorable thing
I've ever heard.

14:39.345 --> 14:41.142
He does have a <i>Rain Man</i> thing
going on, though.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.578
- Autism.
- No.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.680
- His name is Dustin.
- Oh, my God.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.514
I'm sorry, but at a certain age,
your name is your choice.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.814
You know what, we're probably
gonna break up anyway.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.516
You know, he has a really
addictive personality.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.623
He's a raging chocoholic.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.120
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

14:55.194 --> 14:57.719
Um, I thought only women got that.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.688
It was like a joke problem.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.999
What? Abby, men get it too.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.762
There's just so much more shame
associated with it.

15:04.503 --> 15:07.529
- Okay, I'm really ashamed of him.
- I'm ashamed of you, Abby.

15:08.274 --> 15:10.401
- You're a bad person.
- Do you hate women?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.970
- No.
- Anyway, what's Brian like?

15:15.214 --> 15:17.239
Um... You know, I don't know.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.250
Are these red flags?

15:19.318 --> 15:23.948
He has zero empathy, he sets fires,
he tortures small animals.

15:24.556 --> 15:28.117
He wets himself on purpose,
and he's really, really manipulative.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.891
Thoughts?

15:29.962 --> 15:31.623
I don't know, I mean,
he sounds really interesting.

15:32.164 --> 15:34.394
I think you're just projecting
your fear of abandonment.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.298
Abby, a red flag,

15:38.003 --> 15:39.493
is just a green light you're afraid of.

15:40.673 --> 15:41.901
Go to him.

15:46.545 --> 15:47.978
Well, he is my dad.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.245
ALL: Aw!

15:50.983 --> 15:53.008
Boo!

15:57.790 --> 16:00.190
So, M.E., you are a sociopath.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.955
- I am, yes, diagnosed sociopath.
- Let's talk about it.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.054
You asked us to alter your appearance?

16:05.431 --> 16:06.830
- Right.
- Why is that?

16:06.899 --> 16:10.767
Uh, I don't know if you know, there's, like,
a little bit of a stigma about sociopaths.

16:10.836 --> 16:13.703
- Yeah, there's, like, a little stigma.
- Yeah. So, I mean...

16:13.772 --> 16:15.364
Oh, my God, cool.
Let's invite her to our party.

16:15.441 --> 16:16.465
Right, exactly.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.009
I know you've done some television

16:18.510 --> 16:20.068
and you've written a book and...
What's your book called?

16:20.145 --> 16:24.013
It's called <i>Confessions of a Sociopath:</i>
<i>A Life Spent Hiding in Plain Sight.</i> Yeah.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.550
What does it mean to be a sociopath?

16:25.884 --> 16:29.183
Basically, it's like moral insanity.
You don't have a conscience.

16:29.521 --> 16:32.456
I would say the defining traits
are a lack of empathy.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.492
You don't necessarily feel guilt.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.957
Now, I have informally been
diagnosed as a cunt.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.625
- Oh, really?
- There's been no doctors, but it's...

16:40.699 --> 16:43.031
You hear a word enough
and you think it's possible.

16:43.535 --> 16:45.526
- There you go.
- So, flying colors for me.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.664
Um, what was one of the first things
you remember where...

16:48.741 --> 16:50.868
Where people were like,
why don't you feel bad about this?

16:51.443 --> 16:54.640
I think I was like six or seven, eight,
we were watching something on TV,

16:54.713 --> 16:56.180
it was this little boy, he was crying,

16:56.248 --> 16:58.273
something horrible had happened to him,
whatever it was,

16:58.350 --> 17:00.181
and I was kind of laughing
and making fun of him,

17:00.252 --> 17:03.585
and my dad was, like, horrified and said,
you know, "Have you no empathy?"

17:03.889 --> 17:06.517
And that was the first time
that I had heard that word used, "Empathy,"

17:07.026 --> 17:10.223
and I thought, I don't know if I have empathy.
I guess I don't.

17:10.295 --> 17:11.592
What was happening with the boy?

17:11.964 --> 17:14.432
I don't know, you know,
like, had his parents die

17:14.500 --> 17:16.194
- or, you know, something horrible.
- Something bullshit.

17:16.268 --> 17:18.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
some local news story, exactly.

17:18.804 --> 17:22.604
Um, what is the worst thing, you would say,

17:22.674 --> 17:25.404
you've ever done
that people were, like, "That's not okay"?

17:25.978 --> 17:27.969
I have always had very
terrible moral judgment.

17:28.513 --> 17:30.778
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's hard for me, you know, I'll do something

17:30.849 --> 17:32.111
and then people will be outraged and it's...

17:32.184 --> 17:34.209
- Like what?
- Uh, I don't know,

17:34.286 --> 17:36.481
like abandoning my friend who had cancer,

17:36.855 --> 17:38.823
you know, stealing somebody's bike,
you know...

17:39.191 --> 17:42.160
- You stole a bike?
- I've probably stolen, like, 20 bikes.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.855
- Really? What do you do with them?
- (LAUGHS)

17:44.930 --> 17:46.295
I just, like, use them and then I...

17:46.365 --> 17:47.525
Sometimes I put them back.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.157
- Often, I put them back.
- So really,

17:49.468 --> 17:51.265
- Citi Bikes is not a new thing for you.
- No.

17:51.670 --> 17:54.230
When people find out your diagnosis,
are they afraid of you?

17:55.240 --> 17:58.937
I think that people hear the word "sociopath"
and in their mind, they think "killer."

17:59.011 --> 18:00.103
Where did that come from?

18:00.179 --> 18:03.273
Like, um, Hollywood writers being lazy.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.447
- You don't have to tell me.
- Yeah, why did that... Yeah.

18:06.518 --> 18:09.112
Why did that person do that bad thing?
They're a sociopath.

18:09.188 --> 18:10.951
Have you ever been violent?

18:11.023 --> 18:13.583
I wouldn't think of myself
as being terribly violent,

18:13.859 --> 18:15.759
but if you ask me questions like, have you...

18:16.028 --> 18:17.723
Did you used to get in fights
when you were little,

18:17.796 --> 18:19.559
like, or have you ever killed a small animal,

18:19.631 --> 18:21.462
then I would be answering yes
to those questions.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.196
What small animal?

18:23.268 --> 18:26.396
I start off the book talking about
drowning a baby opossum in my pool.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.302
- Well, possums are gross.
- Yes, that's what I thought.

18:29.374 --> 18:32.775
What do you think is the biggest
misconception about sociopaths?

18:33.745 --> 18:37.476
Honestly, I think that empathy is so important.
That empathy...

18:37.883 --> 18:40.147
(CHUCKLES) Everyone's all about
their empathy. Who cares?

18:40.385 --> 18:42.683
They really are, yeah. Let's say I suddenly
take away your empathy...

18:42.754 --> 18:43.914
- Mmm-hmm.
- What are you gonna do?

18:43.989 --> 18:47.220
The very next day, you're gonna go out
and kill your neighbor just, just because?

18:47.292 --> 18:50.420
Right. No. Yeah, you don't all of a sudden
want to kill somebody.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.957
What is something that
you would want people to know?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.856
You know, a sociopath doesn't mean just evil.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.594
You know, there are plenty of sociopaths
out there doing good in the world.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.762
I see a lot of sociopaths who are CEOs,

18:59.838 --> 19:01.897
you see a lot of sociopaths
who are politicians.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.499
There are also a lot of sociopaths
who are surgeons, you know?

19:04.576 --> 19:06.601
If you're empathizing with somebody
as you're cutting into them,

19:06.678 --> 19:08.043
that's, that's not a good thing.

19:08.113 --> 19:09.637
- Yeah, but it can be a good thing.
- Soldiers.

19:09.715 --> 19:10.807
Definitely can be a good thing.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.851
What type of things do make you cry?

19:13.118 --> 19:14.551
- Do you know the last time you cried?
- Onions, cutting onions.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.522
Art makes me cry, music makes me cry,

19:17.589 --> 19:20.183
anything that's kind of either beautiful or, uh,

19:20.692 --> 19:21.989
kind of, I guess, beautiful in the negative.

19:22.427 --> 19:23.724
You're good at reading people.
What do you read about me?

19:24.096 --> 19:27.327
I mean, I think it's interesting that you have
your sister here working with you

19:27.399 --> 19:29.230
and the way that she interacts with you,

19:29.301 --> 19:32.498
and it's probably that you can take things
easier from your sister,

19:33.071 --> 19:35.437
like, criticisms, than you can
take from other people.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.101
She's the one who actually
diagnosed me as a cunt.

19:38.544 --> 19:39.738
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:39.811 --> 19:41.574
- So she would know.
- She would know. (CHUCKLES)

19:48.587 --> 19:50.384
You and I think that we're psychologists.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.116
I don't know if you do. I think so, though.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.455
Like, do you just diagnose people
with personality disorders?

19:54.526 --> 19:55.891
Oh, all the fucking time.

19:55.961 --> 19:59.727
Everybody I... I call my friends
and I'm like, yeah, he's definitely bipolar.

19:59.798 --> 20:01.129
- Right, right.
- Everybody's borderline.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.498
I'm like, well, he's a bordie.
Of course he's acting like that.

20:03.569 --> 20:07.665
But I also like using those
as a way to, uh, make sure...

20:07.739 --> 20:09.263
I make sure that they don't diagnose me

20:09.341 --> 20:10.933
and I'm like, and if you think I'm a narcissist,

20:11.009 --> 20:12.533
here are the reasons that I am not.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.643
AMY: Throw something over, Lena!

20:18.283 --> 20:20.274
- I'm okay!
- (AMY LAUGHS)

20:20.852 --> 20:22.149
This is my choice!

20:22.221 --> 20:23.381
(AMY LAUGHING)

20:24.456 --> 20:25.821
(GROANS)

20:29.428 --> 20:30.656
(CREW LAUGHING)

20:30.729 --> 20:32.094
WOMAN: <i>So easy.</i>

20:32.164 --> 20:33.358
MAN: <i>Mmm, magic.</i>

20:36.368 --> 20:38.836
I like that blue. It's a nice blue.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.929
Exact color as my eyes.

20:41.306 --> 20:44.036
Well, well, it brings out your cheeks,

20:44.109 --> 20:45.872
the pink in your cheeks and the blue, it's...

20:45.944 --> 20:48.879
What the fuck does that mean, Reg?

20:49.748 --> 20:51.238
(LAUGHTER)
