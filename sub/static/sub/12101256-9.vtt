00:17.459 --> 00:19.301
Yeah, she's in
the Dark Realm.

00:19.377 --> 00:21.595
She's trying to figure out
a way to control it somehow,

00:21.630 --> 00:23.805
but she was able
to open a portal

00:23.882 --> 00:25.682
that sent me to the past.

00:25.693 --> 00:30.103
What we need is to split up.

00:30.138 --> 00:32.481
I hate to say it, but splitting
the two of you up

00:32.557 --> 00:34.533
is the only way to make sure
that at least one of you

00:34.610 --> 00:35.868

00:54.538 --> 00:55.837
That's what you said last night.

00:55.914 --> 00:58.507
Yeah, and I'm saying it
again tonight.

00:58.583 --> 01:01.343
Except you didn't wake me up
for my shift.

01:01.419 --> 01:04.354
You're gonna have to get
some sleep sometime, Violet.

You're just like your mother,

<i> If I had known</i>

16:08.325 --> 16:12.253
<i> maybe I would have wished</i>

16:12.329 --> 16:14.973
<i> Maybe then it wouldn't</i>
<i> have been so painful.</i>

16:45.529 --> 16:47.413
Turn around.

16:47.490 --> 16:50.675
I want you to look at me
before I kill you.

16:57.166 --> 17:02.470
<i> When we were finally reunited I</i>
<i> realized how much I failed her.</i>

17:02.546 --> 17:04.472
Dylan.

17:04.548 --> 17:05.523
Hello, mother.

17:05.600 --> 17:09.101
<i> You can't save someone</i>
<i> who's already been lost.</i>

17:09.136 --> 17:16.108
<i> A part of me knew that,</i>
<i> but guilt isn't rational.</i>

17:16.143 --> 17:18.953
<i> And the dark choices continued.</i>

17:19.706 --> 17:20.946
We have to keep moving.

17:21.023 --> 17:23.332
[out of breath]

17:25.027 --> 17:26.544
Dylan.

17:27.196 --> 17:29.705
Please... please feed me.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.167
Dylan, I can't.

17:33.244 --> 17:36.512
I want to, but I could hurt you.

17:37.414 --> 17:38.839
Come on.

17:38.916 --> 17:39.715
Please, please don't kill me.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.482
Please.

17:40.484 --> 17:41.409
I'm not gonna kill you, ok?

17:41.485 --> 17:45.054
You're not gonna turn,
but I need to feed her.

17:45.065 --> 17:45.971
She's a vampire.

17:46.048 --> 17:48.641
You have to kill her.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.443
She's my daughter.

17:51.095 --> 17:52.561
I'm so- sorry.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.522
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

17:54.598 --> 17:56.982
Do you have kids?

17:57.017 --> 17:59.026
No.

17:59.103 --> 18:00.745
Then you don't understand.

18:01.939 --> 18:03.873
[snarling]

18:05.109 --> 18:06.709
Hold out your arm.

18:09.029 --> 18:10.797
Pull up the sleeve.

18:16.412 --> 18:19.847
I promise I will not
bleed you out, ok?

It hurts. It hurts.

<i> Even though I knew</i>

19:04.811 --> 19:07.770
<i> I felt a dark instinct</i>

19:08.297 --> 19:10.973
I'm sorry Dylan,
but I'm gonna try.

19:10.984 --> 19:14.193
<i> The darkness already took</i>

19:20.234 --> 19:22.067
I'm gonna try to turn you.

19:22.102 --> 19:23.411
<i> I fought against it.</i>

19:24.071 --> 19:25.070
No.

19:25.105 --> 19:26.180
No, please. I'm gonna die!
I'll die! I'll die!

19:26.257 --> 19:30.075
No, no, you will not die.
I will not let you die.

19:30.152 --> 19:31.961
I won't let you die.

Please, I'm scared.
I can't. I can't.

19:36.325 --> 19:37.124
It's ok, sweetie.

I can't.

I'm scared, too.
I'm scared, too.

19:48.262 --> 19:49.187
I love you.

No.

You're ok.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

That's better.

Stop!

No, I need that neck sugar!

22:20.197 --> 22:20.788
Come here!

22:20.864 --> 22:21.797
No!

22:22.491 --> 22:24.625
Do you think she remembers?

22:24.701 --> 22:27.053
Or that she's just pretending.

22:28.255 --> 22:29.630
I don't know.

22:29.706 --> 22:31.849
And I don't care.

22:31.926 --> 22:34.185
She's back.

22:34.261 --> 22:36.062
That's all that matters.

22:36.797 --> 22:38.647
So what's next?

22:41.051 --> 22:42.935
Who knows?

22:42.970 --> 22:46.906
We have today,
that's enough for me.

22:48.183 --> 22:48.982
Ooh!

22:49.059 --> 22:50.368
[laughs]

23:11.891 --> 23:13.349

<i> And the cruelest thing.</i>

23:35.248 --> 23:37.081
[gasping]

<i> And it was all because of me.</i>

Come on.

24:33.489 --> 24:34.713
Are you crazy? Stop!

24:34.790 --> 24:35.547
I have to try again.

24:35.582 --> 24:36.715
So you can get ripped
to shreds?

24:36.750 --> 24:39.718
We need a plan.

24:39.795 --> 24:44.056
I have tried every which way to
fight that thing, to evade it,

24:44.091 --> 24:46.558
and I've never gotten more than
10 feet from that door.

24:46.635 --> 24:48.060
What makes you think it'll be
different this time?

24:48.095 --> 24:49.561
It probably won't.

24:49.638 --> 24:50.838
But Jack and Violet,

24:50.914 --> 24:53.941
they need our help now more
than ever so I have to try.

24:54.017 --> 24:56.818
Ok. Ok. Ok.

24:56.829 --> 25:00.498
What- what about this?

25:00.574 --> 25:04.076
If this is your
own mental prison,

25:04.152 --> 25:06.587
maybe you're the reason
I'm here.

25:10.918 --> 25:12.051
What?

25:12.786 --> 25:15.587
When that thing was
attacking me,

25:15.622 --> 25:22.302
right before you found me,
I wished you were here.

25:22.379 --> 25:25.847
And then there you were.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.568
Like you always were
when things got bad.

25:36.944 --> 25:38.244
Vanessa, wait.

25:41.481 --> 25:42.464
<i> Even at our lowest points</i>

25:42.466 --> 25:44.959
<i> we always seemed</i>
<i> to find each other.</i>

25:46.862 --> 25:50.047
<i> Like some unexplainable</i>
<i> tether connecting us.</i>

25:54.661 --> 25:56.378
Axel?

25:56.389 --> 25:58.389
Hey, sleeping beauty.

26:00.417 --> 26:06.388
<i> The tether started out as duty,</i>
<i> but even that got corrupted.</i>

26:06.399 --> 26:08.607
<i> Finally turned to hate.</i>

26:23.732 --> 26:25.866
I know you're there.

26:28.904 --> 26:31.463
It doesn't have to be this way.

26:32.925 --> 26:38.470
[gun shots]

26:52.019 --> 26:54.361
Ain't no other way it can be.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.108
Go on, then.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.871
I told you the next time
I saw you I'd kill you.

27:05.032 --> 27:08.375
Axel, listen.

27:11.738 --> 27:13.088
[groans]

27:26.920 --> 27:28.729
Shit.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.640
<i> I don't want to hurt you, Axel.</i>

27:31.651 --> 27:34.026
A little late for that now,
sleeping beauty.

27:36.805 --> 27:38.939
Why hide now, huh?

27:39.015 --> 27:40.941
What's the matter?
You lose your edge?

27:41.017 --> 27:42.818
What happened to that
blood lust?

27:42.828 --> 27:44.995
<i> I've changed, Axel.</i>

27:45.072 --> 27:46.822
Yeah, me too.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.667
The second you put that blade
in her heart.

27:49.743 --> 27:51.827
You're supposed to be the answer
to all this, you know.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.671
And end all the misery
and the pain.

27:53.747 --> 27:55.914
<i> I still can be.</i>

27:55.949 --> 27:57.916
How're you gonna do that?
Are you gonna bring her back?

27:57.993 --> 27:58.750
Hmm?

27:58.785 --> 28:02.838
You gonna bring
all of them back?

28:02.848 --> 28:05.257
No, this is the way
it's gotta be.

28:05.333 --> 28:08.260
Killing me won't stop the pain.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.853
Well, let's give it a shot.

28:09.930 --> 28:12.981
[gun shots]

28:20.866 --> 28:22.700
You can't hide from me forever.

28:23.727 --> 28:25.152
Only one of us is gonna walk
away from here.

28:25.228 --> 28:26.537
[gun shots]

28:28.148 --> 28:29.748

28:36.698 --> 28:38.165
You ready to talk?

28:38.241 --> 28:40.292
Yeah, sure.
Come on.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.711
Let's talk.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.671
I'm sorry, Axel.

28:44.748 --> 28:45.806
Save it.

[out of breath]

29:08.748 --> 29:10.581
You finished?

29:15.904 --> 29:16.995
You're gonna have to kill me.

29:17.072 --> 29:18.255
I won't do that.

29:19.759 --> 29:22.634
[fighting grunts]

29:24.764 --> 29:27.255
I'm not gonna hurt you!

29:27.266 --> 29:29.767
You kill everyone
you get close to,

29:29.843 --> 29:31.643
why should I be
any different?

29:32.212 --> 29:33.771
[fighting grunts]

29:33.847 --> 29:36.348
All I ever tried to do
was to protect her.

29:36.424 --> 29:39.351
To protect Dylan.

29:39.427 --> 29:40.894
I've lost everything.

29:40.971 --> 29:41.728
Yeah, well-

29:41.805 --> 29:42.771
[groans]

29:42.782 --> 29:44.022
Including you!

29:44.099 --> 29:45.357
The one person in this
up world

29:45.392 --> 29:48.076
that was supposed
to have my back!

29:50.364 --> 29:56.043
I've accepted the losses,
and what it gave me was purpose.

29:56.987 --> 29:58.629
[groans]

30:01.825 --> 30:03.258
Axel! Axel!

30:07.330 --> 30:08.222
Axel.

30:08.882 --> 30:10.557
No, no, no!
Don't do that!

30:11.459 --> 30:12.309
Axel.

30:12.386 --> 30:14.645
There.

30:19.676 --> 30:22.110
Another curse,
thanks to you.

30:27.234 --> 30:29.734
So this is it, huh?

30:29.811 --> 30:32.162
How this all ends?

30:32.439 --> 30:34.122
I guess so.

30:36.943 --> 30:38.961
You gonna cut off my head?

30:40.989 --> 30:44.258
Killing me would be killing
what she sacrificed herself for.

30:55.688 --> 30:56.937
you.

31:00.216 --> 31:02.192
you, too.

31:03.178 --> 31:08.031
I think I brought you here,
and for that I'm sorry.

31:08.108 --> 31:10.742
Your hell's always been my hell,
sleeping beauty.

31:15.148 --> 31:16.448
So if I did bring you here

31:16.483 --> 31:20.377
then I must have some control
over this place.

31:20.454 --> 31:22.170
What're you thinking?

31:25.718 --> 31:27.375
What if the Dark One
didn't create this place

31:27.386 --> 31:30.387
to trap me in the Dark Realm?

31:30.464 --> 31:33.006
What if I created this place?

31:33.083 --> 31:38.228
As an escape route
out of the Dark Realm,

31:38.305 --> 31:41.189
and you're here to help me
figure out how.

31:48.148 --> 31:50.857
So you think you created
this place

31:50.934 --> 31:53.401
like some kind of
bread crumb trail

31:53.412 --> 31:56.154
to help you get out of
the Dark Realm.

31:56.189 --> 31:57.264
I know it seems
like a stretch

31:57.340 --> 31:59.532
but I'm grasping at desperate
straws here, Axel.

31:59.609 --> 32:00.508
Ok.

32:00.510 --> 32:03.912
So you're trapped
in the Dark Realm

32:03.923 --> 32:06.414
and you somehow create
this dream land kind of a place

32:06.425 --> 32:10.001
where nothing but horrible
memories happen.

32:10.078 --> 32:11.878
There's an evil bog monster

32:11.955 --> 32:13.931
keeping you from getting
out the exit door

32:14.007 --> 32:19.102
until you figure out whatever
it is you need to figure out.

32:19.179 --> 32:20.479
Yeah.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.431
Well, maybe that's what you need
to figure out.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.943
Why I'm here.

32:26.019 --> 32:29.104
So that you can realize that you
were in control the whole time.

32:29.114 --> 32:33.441
I don't know. It doesn't
feel right.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.860
Well, let's go fight that
darkness and see what happens.

32:35.895 --> 32:38.497
Axel, it's too simple.

32:40.701 --> 32:41.700
You've been fighting
the darkness

32:41.776 --> 32:45.504
ever since you got off that slab
at the hospital.

32:46.448 --> 32:48.215
If you can't beat this thing...

32:49.209 --> 32:52.052
I don't see what other help
I can be.

32:54.497 --> 32:57.975
You know I've been fighting
darkness a lot longer than that.

32:59.478 --> 33:03.146
Not just in front of me
but within me.

33:04.984 --> 33:07.192
Ever since I was a child.

33:14.976 --> 33:16.484
<i> But why did we have</i>
<i> to leave her?</i>

33:16.495 --> 33:19.279
<i> No, no, no, no, no.</i>

33:19.355 --> 33:20.905
Vanessa, please stop.

33:20.940 --> 33:22.332
Your father needs to drive
and he needs to focus.

33:22.409 --> 33:24.334
He's not my father!
He's not, he's not!

33:24.411 --> 33:26.411
Goddammit, I'm trying
to keep you both alive!

33:26.446 --> 33:27.579
<i> Watch out!</i>

33:27.655 --> 33:29.006
[screeching tires]

33:29.082 --> 33:31.008
[crashing metal]

34:08.213 --> 34:15.293
<i> [whispers]</i>

34:15.328 --> 34:17.545
<i> I was never scared.</i>

34:17.556 --> 34:21.966
<i> It felt... familiar.</i>

34:22.043 --> 34:23.635
<i> Like a missing piece.</i>

34:23.711 --> 34:26.971
[thunder rolls]

34:27.048 --> 34:32.944
[whispering continues]

34:41.154 --> 34:42.695
<i> The darkness felt inescapable,</i>

34:42.772 --> 34:46.374
<i> like it was wrapping</i>
<i> its arms around me.</i>

34:48.161 --> 34:50.212
<i> A cruel comfort.</i>

34:52.591 --> 34:55.083
I've seen you before.

34:55.094 --> 34:56.301
[crash]

34:59.622 --> 35:01.640
In the beginning.

35:03.293 --> 35:04.717
When I was a kid.

35:04.794 --> 35:07.554
When your rage first began.

35:07.630 --> 35:10.598
You get a kick out of that?
Scaring little kids?

35:10.609 --> 35:14.602
I come to those
who show promise.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.354
Promise of what?

35:16.389 --> 35:20.525
I think you know,
deep inside you.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.402
It has to be you.

35:22.478 --> 35:24.362
What're you doing, Scarlett?

35:24.439 --> 35:27.615
You are our only hope.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.292
Don't do it.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.169
Scarlett.

35:32.322 --> 35:35.206
You will end the Dark One.

35:35.241 --> 35:37.208
Please don't.

35:37.285 --> 35:38.084
Don't do it.

35:38.161 --> 35:39.377
You.

35:39.412 --> 35:40.044
No.

35:40.121 --> 35:41.379
You.

35:41.414 --> 35:43.098
Scarlett, no.

35:43.550 --> 35:45.142
Don't do it.

35:45.835 --> 35:46.759
[screams]
No!!!

35:46.836 --> 35:49.312
[sobbing]
No!!!

35:49.389 --> 35:51.356
Scarlett no!!!

35:55.228 --> 35:57.028
<i> And there it was again.</i>

35:57.430 --> 35:58.488
No!

35:58.565 --> 36:01.658
<i> The loss, the pain.</i>

36:04.496 --> 36:09.332
<i> Maybe as much as I wanted</i>
<i> to believe that I...</i>

36:09.409 --> 36:12.377
<i> I wasn't destined to be</i>
<i> the light.</i>

36:14.155 --> 36:16.581
I gave you everything.

36:16.658 --> 36:20.293
I gave you everything
I had just to save you.

36:20.370 --> 36:22.345
And you do this?

36:22.422 --> 36:23.847
[sobbing]

36:23.924 --> 36:26.132
You could have stopped her.

36:26.209 --> 36:29.227
You're the strong one!

36:29.930 --> 36:34.065
You can't fight the darkness,
you are the darkness!

36:40.640 --> 36:42.574
What if I was wrong?

36:43.726 --> 36:48.163
What if the darkness out there
is me?

36:53.545 --> 36:54.469
Are you sure about this?

36:54.471 --> 36:56.037
Nope, but what choice
do we have?

36:56.048 --> 36:58.039
Not getting your head
ripped off?

36:58.050 --> 36:59.374
This might all be
a mental construct,

36:59.384 --> 37:00.458
but it also might not be.

37:00.493 --> 37:02.385
You're saying you don't want me
to do this. Noted.

37:02.462 --> 37:04.045
I'm saying up to this point
it's all just talk,

37:04.056 --> 37:05.222
we don't know shit.

37:05.298 --> 37:08.549
Master Tsui says ignorance
is just a lesson to be learned.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.718
Let's go learn something.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.437
Who's Master Tsui?

37:16.217 --> 37:17.016
You think it'll show?

37:17.093 --> 37:18.860
It always does.

37:19.312 --> 37:21.947
Ok, well, what do you
want me to do?

37:22.432 --> 37:26.234
Well, if we're wrong,
try not to let it kill me.

37:26.245 --> 37:27.577
Don't be wrong.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.123
[growling]

37:35.587 --> 37:37.420
It's now or never.

37:41.743 --> 37:44.419
There's no need
for disguises anymore.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.304
I know what you are.

37:57.717 --> 37:59.567
Back for more?

38:00.687 --> 38:02.729
Holy shit, you were right.

38:02.805 --> 38:05.064
You said it yourself.

38:05.141 --> 38:06.616
I am the darkness.

38:06.693 --> 38:09.610
When will you learn?

38:09.621 --> 38:11.404
You can never defeat me.

38:11.481 --> 38:13.031
[scoffs]

38:13.107 --> 38:14.958
Who says I need to defeat you?

38:15.035 --> 38:19.120
You have fought me
your entire life.

38:19.131 --> 38:22.582
A life filled with pain.

38:22.658 --> 38:24.042
Failure.

38:24.118 --> 38:26.210
See, that was my problem.

38:26.287 --> 38:28.588
I thought I had to fight you.

38:28.664 --> 38:30.590
To destroy you.

38:30.666 --> 38:33.468
So that I could become
the light.

38:33.478 --> 38:36.637
We both know there's no light
without darkness,

38:36.648 --> 38:40.475
but I know now that the darkness
is a part of me.

38:40.485 --> 38:46.197
Always has been,
always will be.

38:47.308 --> 38:49.317
Then you understand.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.153
I will be your death.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.330
Hmm.

38:54.574 --> 38:57.617
Do you still think
you can beat me?

38:57.693 --> 38:59.002
Fighting you has been like

38:59.079 --> 39:01.671
fighting an integral part
of who I am.

39:01.748 --> 39:07.010
I need to own who...
what I am.

39:11.874 --> 39:14.425
Time to take control
of my darkness.

39:14.460 --> 39:19.522
You're a fool if you think
you can control me.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.193
Woah, woah, woah.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.814
You're wrong.

39:27.890 --> 39:31.326
This place has made me stronger
than I could ever imagine.

39:38.734 --> 39:41.336
I realize that I'm not
the light.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.706
The darkness will destroy you.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.717
Unless I destroy it first.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.391
[groans]

40:02.258 --> 40:03.358
Vanessa?

40:07.889 --> 40:09.697
Are you ok?

40:11.267 --> 40:13.734
Yeah, you?

40:13.745 --> 40:16.571
I think so, yeah.

40:16.581 --> 40:20.408
Yeah, for the first time
in a long time, I am.

40:20.419 --> 40:22.085
[door opens]

40:22.445 --> 40:24.629
It looks like we can
go home now.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.250
You're not really here.

40:29.261 --> 40:30.418
When I go through
that portal

40:30.429 --> 40:33.337
you'll wake up
right where you were.

40:33.414 --> 40:35.214
Right.

40:35.291 --> 40:37.175
What about you?

40:37.210 --> 40:38.843
You said the Dark One
is in D.C.?

40:38.920 --> 40:40.720
That's where I'll be.

40:40.796 --> 40:42.221
You're just gonna stroll up
to the White House,

40:42.298 --> 40:44.098
take down the whole military
by yourself?

40:44.109 --> 40:45.766
Yeah, I'll need a disguise.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.403
Someone the Dark One
will never suspect.

40:50.449 --> 40:52.449
I got the perfect candidate.

40:56.979 --> 40:58.446
Axel.

40:58.457 --> 40:59.947
Axel, wake up.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.166
Axel, wake up.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.284
Come on.

41:03.295 --> 41:04.452
Axel, wake up!

41:04.463 --> 41:05.462
Axel!

41:05.538 --> 41:07.538
It's ok. It's ok.

41:07.615 --> 41:09.207
You were having a nightmare.

41:09.283 --> 41:10.800
I couldn't wake you up.

41:10.877 --> 41:13.377
It scared the shit out of me.

41:13.454 --> 41:15.588
That was no nightmare.

41:15.665 --> 41:17.265
Then what was it?

41:19.335 --> 41:21.311
Vanessa.

41:22.964 --> 41:24.856
She's back.

41:31.397 --> 41:32.897
So why didn't she come
with you here

41:32.974 --> 41:33.898
so we can go together?

41:33.975 --> 41:35.233
You know, strength in numbers?

41:35.268 --> 41:36.567
I'm sure she's got a plan.

41:36.602 --> 41:38.236
She didn't share it with you?

41:38.312 --> 41:40.279
Look, I told you, she put her
hands on my head

41:40.356 --> 41:42.490
and the next thing I know
I wake up here.

41:42.501 --> 41:44.992
She was never really
a big sharer.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.828
How do you know that the
darkness didn't control her?

41:47.839 --> 41:49.747
Oh, she's in control.

41:49.824 --> 41:50.998
You can count on that.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.291
Ok, well what if she needs
our help?

41:52.368 --> 41:53.026
She definitely needs our help.

41:53.102 --> 41:54.344
We gotta get to D.C. first.

41:54.420 --> 41:55.178
Ok, but what if-

41:55.255 --> 41:58.756
Look, kid, you gotta
trust her, ok?

41:58.833 --> 42:01.425
I know I do.

42:01.502 --> 42:03.436
You trust her, right?

42:04.964 --> 42:06.314
Yeah.

42:07.100 --> 42:10.735
I trust her, I just wish
I knew where she was.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.738
You and me both.
