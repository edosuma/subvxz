00:08.008 --> 00:09.551
<i>Previously on You Me Her...</i>

00:09.634 --> 00:11.761
I didn't just come here
to fight for you, Em.

00:11.845 --> 00:15.390
Carlin's announcing his retirement
and his successor.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.726
Only way you don't get it
is if you're not there.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.812
Our young girls are off
to first day of daycare.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.480
And it's all good. It's no big deal.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.566
I said I'm either taking
a month off or I'm quitting.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.526
-Looks like I'll be spending

00:26.609 --> 00:30.697
a month's sabbatical
diligently not writing a children's book.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.908
The hell is he doing here?
You told me to take a beat but not him?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.453
She told you she needs "a beat"?
Told me she needs "a minute."

00:36.536 --> 00:38.747
Okay, look, here's the deal:
we're gonna meet back here tomorrow,

00:38.830 --> 00:39.873
and I'll reveal my choice.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.875
I spoke to Meredith at Directions.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.501
They're interested
in offering you a counselling job.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.962
And they'll invite you
to Seattle to live in their house

00:46.045 --> 00:49.424
with their baby
and keep living their life.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.259
Were you guys gonna leave a note?

00:51.342 --> 00:53.678
We're leaving for Seattle
tomorrow at oh-dark thirty.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.263
I can't just leave my life.

00:55.346 --> 00:58.808
My best friend is here,
and my dad is looking for a job here.

00:58.892 --> 00:59.976
This is my home.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.853
Well, if you're not going,
we're not going.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.731
No, Em, I want you guys to go to Seattle.

01:04.814 --> 01:08.359
Think about it, talk about it,
give it a real chance.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.195
And I'm gonna be here
when you get back.

Come on, just breathe, Em.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.396
What the fuck are we thinking?!
We just drove away from Izzy

01:45.480 --> 01:47.941
after she said there was no way in hell
she'd move to Seattle?

01:48.024 --> 01:50.735
Then she said she would
give us the chance to talk her into it.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.987
Yeah, well, did it look like
she meant that to you?

01:53.071 --> 01:55.323
I don't know. Maybe

01:55.406 --> 01:57.325
What if she wants us
to move to Seattle?

01:57.408 --> 02:00.078
-You remember what she said. "Jack and Emma's baby
in Jack and Emma's house."

02:02.914 --> 02:05.041
Fuck. You know, we made it
crystal fucking clear

02:05.125 --> 02:06.835
we weren't gonna live in that loft.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.171
-Oh, no.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.258
She was with her dad yesterday.
What if he convinced her to end it?

02:13.842 --> 02:15.260
We just got dumped.

02:17.846 --> 02:18.680
Or...

02:18.763 --> 02:19.889
Or what?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.142
Or maybe she's the one
being the adult here.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.270
Maybe she knows
you'll resent her and me, too,

02:25.353 --> 02:28.231
if you pass up the opportunity of a
lifetime without even taking the meeting.

02:29.774 --> 02:32.610
What if Carlin makes me
an offer I can't refuse?

02:32.694 --> 02:34.737
You know, what if we move to Seattle...

02:34.988 --> 02:37.198
and we're miserable
and we fucked it up?

02:37.574 --> 02:39.701
What if this was a test,
and we just failed it?

02:39.784 --> 02:42.579
Well, even if it's a test,
she's right.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.873
We gotta go.
We have to consider it.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.334
Yeah.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.795
Can we get back in the car, please?

03:10.565 --> 03:11.816
Here you go.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.610
Thanks.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.780
How you doin', Peanut?

03:18.406 --> 03:19.574
Me?

03:19.657 --> 03:21.451
No, the other Peanut.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.038
I'm good. Mm-hmm.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.999
That weird outburst out front...
I do that.

03:28.082 --> 03:32.211
You know, just, like...
full moon or whatever.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.596
What are you doing?

03:41.679 --> 03:42.847
I'm cleaning.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.849
Not really.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.435
You're just picking things up
and putting them somewhere else.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.813
Just mind your own business
and drink your espresso.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.857
Actually, you are over 50.

03:52.941 --> 03:56.653
Why don't you find yourself
a nice morning news show?

03:57.153 --> 03:59.989
All the commercials are for arthritis,
dementia, hair loss.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.243
All important issues
for your kind, right?

04:04.661 --> 04:06.079
-Isabelle.

04:07.872 --> 04:08.915
Izzy.

04:09.457 --> 04:10.792
-Iz.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.836
Just... just come over here
and sit down for a minute.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.262
You did the right thing.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.682
-It doesn't feel like it.
-I know.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.269
-I'll spare you the Band-Aid analogy.
-Thank you. I was hoping they wouldn't go,
no matter what I said.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.490
Well, she's gotta take that job.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.909
It just makes sense...

04:45.493 --> 04:46.703
for them.

04:47.704 --> 04:51.124
Can we just be done ripping off
Band

04:51.207 --> 04:52.292
Thanks.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.920
Actually, I gotta get back to the site.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.715
I hate to leave you all alone.

04:58.798 --> 05:02.176
No, it's fine. I'm gonna crash
at Nina's for a while, so...

05:02.260 --> 05:04.053
Oh. Well, good.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.431
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you pack up your stuff,

05:06.514 --> 05:08.641
give me some keys,
and I'll haul it over later?

05:08.725 --> 05:09.934
-Yeah.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.563
Thanks. Um...

05:17.775 --> 05:19.652
-Take these.
-Okay.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.823
I don't want you to go.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.369
Well, I can stay, like,
five more minutes.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.748
That's not what I meant.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.756
I-I have some leads.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.341
Cool.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.561
Big day. Gonna get Carlin's office,
sofa sleeper and all.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.521
His couch is a sleeper?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.732
And there's a closet
at the back of the full bathroom.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.025
I heard that he's retiring

05:59.108 --> 06:00.943
because his third wife
threatened to divorce him.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.654
Anyway, uh, Earth Juice wants
some kind of retractable cover

06:03.738 --> 06:06.491
over the proposed green space,
because Seattle,

06:06.574 --> 06:08.326
and a full budget by Thursday.

06:08.409 --> 06:11.704
-Email dropped 10 minutes ago.
Are you serious?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.457
Lucy, could you give us
the room, please?

06:14.540 --> 06:17.502
-Ooh, "give us the room."
-You're fired. I mean it this time.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.796
Oh, no.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.676
How badly do you hate me?

06:26.844 --> 06:29.806
It was a 10.
Now it's roughly 8.2.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.310
Still high enough to scheme
your unseemly demise

06:34.393 --> 06:37.605
after you accept
Carlin's ridiculous offer.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.234
He's ready.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.946
You know your answer?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.406
Uh, no.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.624
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

07:19.313 --> 07:22.066
Yeah, I always forget
if it's do it or don't do it.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.452
So?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.334
I told them I was staying in Portland.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.087
I insisted they go, and they did.

07:46.299 --> 07:50.261
And you were hoping
that they wouldn't, obviously?

07:52.680 --> 07:53.639

willing to duel to the death.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.707
Fine. They wouldn't even do
a dance-off.

Tough life.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.131
Okay, look.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.926
Here's how good of a friend I am.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.053
After I make my choice,

08:32.136 --> 08:34.639
I'm gonna toss you
my sloppy seconds, okay?

08:34.722 --> 08:37.266
-Mm-hmm.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.684
-Don't.
-Mnh.

08:41.729 --> 08:42.730

in the Nina Martone sweepstakes.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.371
Nina Martone.

09:00.748 --> 09:04.502
Why do you keep trying to figure out
which dude is gonna finally complete you?

09:21.018 --> 09:23.312
Does it make it worse that I'm, um...

09:23.729 --> 09:27.149
I'm actually... semi

09:31.696 --> 09:34.198
Only if you never
do anything about it.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.744
Aw.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.331
We've synched our periods
and our life epiphanies.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.547
Anyway, the point of
that rambling monologue is that

09:49.630 --> 09:51.716
I think it's only fair
that you know who I am.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.760
I'm Emma Seaver Trakarsky,

09:54.844 --> 09:57.138
pregnant bisexual polyamorist.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.140
And if Jack and Izzy don't want this,

09:59.223 --> 10:02.893
then I don't want it either.
So I'm gonna need a little time.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.814
And if that disqualifies me,
then so be it.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.820
Okay, I guess you should
probably talk now. Right?

10:22.079 --> 10:23.497
Hey.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.083
Hey, back. How was it?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.795
I told Dennis everything,

10:30.254 --> 10:34.508
and he said as long as I keep
drawing big, pretty buildings,

10:34.592 --> 10:37.178
I can be as bisexual, polyamorous,

10:37.261 --> 10:39.263
and pregnant as I wanna be.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.766
<i>Such</i> an asshole.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.064
I have no idea when
she put that in my pocket.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.858
"Here or there,
I'll love you. Izzy."

10:55.488 --> 10:57.031
So what are you thinking?

10:57.865 --> 10:59.367
I love building things.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.244
You know, I have ever since
I was a weird little kid

11:02.328 --> 11:04.872
with the world's largest
Lego collection.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.290
-Yeah.
-But...

11:08.042 --> 11:10.586
Along the way, I found
a few things I love more:

11:10.670 --> 11:15.466
you, Izzy, this baby, our friends.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.512
You need time for those things.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.224
You don't get that when you're managing
partner at a firm like Pinnacle.

11:23.307 --> 11:27.228
You get a sleeper sofa and a full-sized
bathroom in your office.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.315
So what now?

11:32.441 --> 11:34.110
Like I told Izzy,

11:34.693 --> 11:36.529
we'll figure it out.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.616
Go back to Portland, we climb
whatever trellis we need to climb,

11:40.699 --> 11:42.243
and we go get our girl.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.911
-Abso-fucking-lutely.
-All right.

12:09.728 --> 12:10.980
Here.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.151
Hi.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.195
No. I have somewhere to be.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.365
Where? You're homeless
and unemployed. Sit.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.660
So as it turns out,
you didn't go see your grandma,

12:24.743 --> 12:27.580
which means it didn't really go poorly.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.041
-Hi.
-You smell like dogs.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.587
-I can't.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.258
I'm sorry.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.511
It's a start.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.513
It's a start?

12:44.597 --> 12:47.224
"You smell like dogs"

12:47.308 --> 12:49.768
Seriously. It's never easy.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.523
That girl sets her mind,
it's like trying to pry off a wheel boot.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.776
I'm not gonna give up.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.614
I'm in.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.706
By the way, you do not
smell like dogs, just so you know.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.416
-Thank you.
-You smell very nice.

in wildly different ways.

don't you think?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.495

14:33.706 --> 14:36.083
-but in the shape of a person.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.502

14:38.586 --> 14:41.005
-Oh. Thanks.
-You're welcome.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.424

work out, you wanna hang out?

14:43.507 --> 14:44.800
-I think we are.
-Oh.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.052
Hey, hi, hi. You two want
some alone time or what?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.554
Nope, we're all good.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.514
-Oh.

14:52.516 --> 14:56.312
Actually, you two doing the sex
isn't entirely off-topic.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.481
I, uh, I-I can't seem
to settle on just one,

14:59.565 --> 15:01.483
so I'm choosing both.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.486
I wanna be a throuple,

15:04.570 --> 15:07.364
just like EJI, except with two penises.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.991
What the hell is "edgy"?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.618
That's Emma, Jack, and Izzy.

15:11.535 --> 15:12.912
I think you missed the headline.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.706
Oh. Oh!

15:16.540 --> 15:19.293
Yeah. No.
No, that's not happening.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.587
-I'm fucking with you.
-Oh.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.964
I-I'm not really choosing
both of you.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.342
Or... either.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.137
Look...

15:30.930 --> 15:32.348
I'm choosing me.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.850
I have spent most of my life

15:34.934 --> 15:37.937
trying to be whatever it is
I thought men wanted me to be.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.274
And, um, now it's time
for me to figure out

15:42.358 --> 15:46.028
how to be authentically,
genuinely Nina.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.156
And that way, when someone digs me,
I'll know it's for real.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.117
And... when someone doesn't,
I won't give a shit.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.703
Hmm.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.289
So...

15:57.373 --> 15:59.083
This shit is messed up.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.045
Getting right with myself before I get
serious with somebody else is messed up?

16:03.128 --> 16:06.507
Honestly, I was, 99% certain
she was gonna pick you,

16:06.590 --> 16:09.259
so this is a pretty solid win for me.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.015
Nin, come on.
What are you doing?

16:15.099 --> 16:17.810
No, I'm not ready, and neither are you.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.694
All right. I'm out.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.616
Good on you, Nin.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.995
That couldn't have been easy.

16:40.874 --> 16:44.294
You... you're kinda fucking up
my program here, Shaun.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.338
Oh. I do that.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.840
Do you want me to leave?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.219
Oh, shit.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.476
-I got a job.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.770
I'm consoling you
because you got a job?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.606
I checked
Jack's underwear drawer.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.442
Mm. No ring?

17:11.071 --> 17:13.282
I'm pretty sure
they're moving to Seattle.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.501
Iz?

17:25.294 --> 17:26.503
Izzy?

17:30.466 --> 17:33.469
-She's not answering.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.182
Wait. Listen.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.726
[vibrating continues,
cellphone beeps] -There it is.
-Shit.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.482
We should never have gone.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.276
No, you shouldn't have come back.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.278
Who's that?

17:51.487 --> 17:55.282
This is Ben, Izzy's dad.
Come right in.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.910
I've come to get her stuff.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.703
-Yeah.

18:00.287 --> 18:03.248
And that's her phone.
I'll take it to her.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.835
I will give it to her

18:06.919 --> 18:10.047
when I tell her we're not moving
to Seattle or Hawthorne Heights.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.095
You got everything you want.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.847
You're back together,
you're having a baby,

18:18.931 --> 18:20.933
you're moving to the suburbs.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.686
Look, do right by her.

18:25.729 --> 18:26.939
Move on.

18:27.815 --> 18:28.732
Move on? Yeah.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.652
What, like you did
when she was a teenager?

18:31.735 --> 18:35.197
Oh, oh, we're gettin' shitty now?
Is that how this is gonna be?

18:37.491 --> 18:41.411
Look, I'm aware of how acutely
fucked up this must seem.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.289
And seven months ago, I would've
thought the same thing.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.459
Yeah, we were just a suburban couple,
struggling to have kids.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.087
We weren't looking
to get into any scene or lifestyle.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.631
-No, it's not... it's not who we were.
-No.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.424
Is that right?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.344
Then who are you now?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.681
I'm the woman who drove away
from the job of a lifetime

19:00.764 --> 19:03.976
because I am deeply in love
with your daughter.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.479
We tried to imagine a life without her,
and we just couldn't.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.982
No. We belong together, and...

19:10.649 --> 19:12.526
that's the truth of it.

19:12.609 --> 19:16.989
She is never gonna feel permanent
in <i>your</i> world with <i>your</i> kid.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.366
Can't you see that?

19:21.660 --> 19:24.663
Actually, that's exactly what
we were discussing on the way home.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.291
We need to make a real commitment to us

19:27.374 --> 19:29.084
and to her,

19:29.168 --> 19:30.794
and we have a plan.

19:32.045 --> 19:35.591
We wanna make it official,
the three of us.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.012
How the hell are you gonna do that?

19:40.262 --> 19:43.098
-Okay, don't take this the wrong way...
-This should be good.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.727
But I'm, like, really struggling

19:46.810 --> 19:49.563
with this sudden shift
in our relationship dynamic.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.523
-Uh...

19:51.607 --> 19:54.651
Come on. I mean, God, I'm...

19:54.735 --> 19:57.112
I really miss feeling better than you.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.366
Don't be sad.
You'll catch up... eventually.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.832
Okay, what's wrong?

20:08.916 --> 20:11.585
I just thought they'd call, at least.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.921
Well, good riddance, Griswolds.
Right?

20:14.004 --> 20:15.047
Mm-hmm.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.256
Good riddance.

20:19.092 --> 20:20.844
Um, you're... you're calling me.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.429
What?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.435
Yeah, she's here.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.440
Uh

20:37.611 --> 20:38.820
What?

20:41.657 --> 20:43.075
Okay.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.496
What?

20:47.579 --> 20:49.623
You left your phone at the loft.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.084
Okay, so they're back?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.419
We gotta go.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.797
-Just come with me.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.090
-Wh--
-Just come.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.303
-So, hi.
-Hey, Izzy.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.723
Hi?

21:48.348 --> 21:51.601
Um, this is our neighbor,
Helen Wilberg,

21:51.685 --> 21:55.230
who, it turns out, doesn't bake at all

21:55.314 --> 21:57.316
but is an actual judge.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.192
Come here.

21:59.776 --> 22:00.944
Hi.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.863
We didn't have time to rehearse,

22:02.946 --> 22:05.240
um, so we're just kind of
winging it here.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.867
-Uh, I'll start. Okay.
-Yeah, go ahead.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.870
-Okay.

22:09.953 --> 22:13.248
So there is no such thing
as a three-person marriage.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.252
Ben?

22:18.170 --> 22:19.212
Dad?

22:21.006 --> 22:25.427
Well, let's not make a thing
out of this, yeah? I'll just...

22:31.933 --> 22:34.186
-Um...
-Yeah, go.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.979
Be free.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.274
Uh... Should we...

22:45.572 --> 22:46.907
You didn't return it.

22:46.990 --> 22:50.494
No. Um, I saw you looking
through my underwear drawer,

22:50.577 --> 22:51.995
so I moved it.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.791
Okay, one more time.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.753
-There is no such thing as a three-per--
-Stop. Stop.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.005
-But we... we have a lot more--
-No, please.

23:03.381 --> 23:05.801
This is very sweet and...

23:07.260 --> 23:08.136
weird.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.307
But Jack, I want you to put that ring
on your wife's finger,

23:12.390 --> 23:13.558
where it belongs.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.228
And while you're living the best,
happiest life in Seattle--

23:16.311 --> 23:17.771
No, we're not going to Seattle.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.900
And I already have a ring.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.235
Same.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.404
Oh.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.031
This is our home, too.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.408
For better or for worse,
we're stuck with this bunch of losers.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.160
-Dick!
-Okay.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.246
-Nice.
-Honey...

23:36.998 --> 23:39.543
Okay, once again.

23:39.626 --> 23:40.544
Uh...

23:40.627 --> 23:43.171
there's no such thing
as a three-person marriage,

23:43.255 --> 23:45.632
so we invented one.

23:46.508 --> 23:51.304
Yeah, Emma and I will always
be connected by this baby,

23:51.388 --> 23:55.016
but now we wanna be connected
with you, too.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.062
So, um...

24:00.188 --> 24:01.314
Oh, wow.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.441
Here.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.238
Izzy Silva...

24:09.948 --> 24:11.449
will you marry us?

24:13.952 --> 24:15.662
As in right here, right now.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.206
Well, technically,
you can only marry one of us,

24:18.290 --> 24:20.125
-but we know the truth.
-Yeah.

24:23.712 --> 24:27.757
Um, I'm pretty sure that would be,
like, the worst idea ever.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.261
-Yeah, no, just stand up.

24:33.930 --> 24:37.809
How's it worked out so far when one of
you thought I was favoring the other one?

24:39.102 --> 24:41.521
-I'd say it...
-Well, we're not--

24:41.605 --> 24:43.899
-No, it was bad. It was bad.
-Bad. Yeah.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.025
Yeah.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.027
And it shouldn't be
about a piece of paper.

24:47.110 --> 24:51.114
It should be about you and you and me

24:51.907 --> 24:53.700
going all in together.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.494
I like the way this is going.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.831
Wouldn't be my first
Poly Commitment Ceremony.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.669
It's a spiritual commitment,
not a legal one.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.176
Ordinarily, you each
would've prepared

25:11.259 --> 25:14.638
-a heartfelt declaration--
-Right, we all love each other,

25:14.721 --> 25:16.890
we never expected this,
blah blah blah.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.100
Here's the fucking deal, okay?

25:19.184 --> 25:23.146
If any one of us tries to leave again,
there's no coming back.

25:23.939 --> 25:27.525
You walk, you just keep walking.
Okay?

25:30.153 --> 25:31.321
Okay.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.908
So, do you, Jack...

25:36.910 --> 25:39.746
and Emma, accept my proposal?

25:40.538 --> 25:41.539
I do.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.167
I do.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.420
Alrighty then. Anybody object?

25:49.005 --> 25:50.548
Uh, nope.

25:51.549 --> 25:53.301
Okay.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.679
Maybe put the ring on her finger?

25:55.762 --> 25:57.889
-Okay. Um...

25:57.973 --> 25:59.266
Oh, right.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.393
-Try to finish the job.
Okay.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.817
I hereby pronounce you
spiritually, soulfully,

26:08.900 --> 26:12.320
and lovingly committed
to one another forever and ever.
