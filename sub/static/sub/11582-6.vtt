In the criminal justice system,

00:03.104 --> 00:06.507
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.210
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.243 --> 00:11.079
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.112 --> 00:12.780
are members of
an elite squad known as

00:12.813 --> 00:14.315
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.417
These are their stories.

00:17.718 --> 00:18.686
[toy car motor whirs]

00:18.719 --> 00:20.421
(woman)
Theo. Theo!

00:20.454 --> 00:22.256
Stop playing with
the birthday presents.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.257
Henry, hold still.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.458
Mom, that hurts.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.060
Theo.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.328
Theo, it is
not your birthday.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.496
You're gonna break that.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.200
Got more on your face
than in your tummy.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.102
I want another piece
of cake.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.470
Oh yeah?
We'll see, Puppy.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.672
Theo?

00:38.706 --> 00:39.840
Theo?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.275
Theo.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.710
Theodore.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.712
I'm right here.
Stop yelling.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.713
I have told you

00:45.746 --> 00:47.848
a million times not
to disappear like that.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.650
You said don't play
with the birthday presents.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.520
I'm not.
Sure.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.222
Henry?

00:54.255 --> 00:55.423
Where'd he go?

00:55.456 --> 00:56.424
I don't know.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.658
Henry?

00:57.691 --> 01:01.129
Henry!

01:01.162 --> 01:02.430
Henry.

01:06.634 --> 01:07.601
(Cragen)
1-8 is sending

01:07.635 --> 01:08.802
manpower to canvass.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.338
There's four birthday parties
going on.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.772
Couple hundred kids
and parents.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.641
Nobody saw Henry Morton
wander off.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.510
Well, whoever took him
knew how to be invisible.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.878
Parents rent
the party section.

01:17.911 --> 01:18.846
There is public access.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.514
But the employees have all
been accounted for.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.216
Picture from mom's wallet.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.152
Now, we're covered
from 23rd Street down to Tenth,

01:24.185 --> 01:25.386
Second Avenue
to Broadway.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.620
Print up fliers.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.888
Mom remember anything else?

01:27.921 --> 01:28.889
No, she's too upset.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.857
EMS took her
to St. Vincent's.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.159
Her husband's
with her now.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.760
Send Munch to get
a statement

01:32.793 --> 01:33.827
soon as she calms down.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.629
(officer)
Sighting. Lower Broadway.

01:35.663 --> 01:36.730
Benson.
SVU.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.532
Description?

01:38.566 --> 01:40.234
No, he has brown hair.
Thanks.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.835
Kid left alone.
Blonde hair and khakis.

01:41.869 --> 01:42.836
(Fin)
Security tape's up.

01:42.870 --> 01:46.540
I got Henry.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.908
Okay, here's Henry
with Mom.

01:47.941 --> 01:48.776
She's coming toward us.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.579
She's looking for
the older kid.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.681
Henry's right there
with the yellow balloon.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.316
Henry comes down the aisle.

01:55.349 --> 01:56.584
He's still got the balloon.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.253
Rounds the corner.
Keeps going, going...

01:59.287 --> 02:00.788
(Benson)
Gone.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.324
(Fin)
There's the balloon
on the floor.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.858
Kid was out of camera range
five seconds.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.260
Hey, what about the cameras
at the front door?

02:06.294 --> 02:07.495
Nothing.
Must've went out the back.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.498
So we got ourselves
one smart perv.

02:10.531 --> 02:15.436
So smart that he's got his eye
on the kid and the cameras.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.604
Go away, Wolinsky!

02:16.637 --> 02:18.739
That's no way to treat
a concerned citizen.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.573
You gotta stop listening

02:19.607 --> 02:21.542
to that police scanner
and get a life.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.544
Just trying to pick up
the slack for you guys.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.545
It's Sunday.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.414
Take the day off.
Go to church.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.415
Malcom Wolinsky.
Yeah.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.550
Association for
the Protection of Children.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.285
I know who you are.
Get lost.

02:31.319 --> 02:32.886
Me and my group,
we have a legal right

02:32.920 --> 02:34.288
to investigate
and make arrests.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.490
Last time you almost
cost us the conviction.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.526
Your daughter was molested,
you'd want our help.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.362
Officers, escort these gentlemen
behind the barricade.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.464
They cause any trouble,
collar 'em.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.532
Arrest us?
For what?

02:44.565 --> 02:45.399
Obstruction.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.500
(woman)
He was dragging the boy

02:46.534 --> 02:47.501
down the street.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.237
He had wavy red hair.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.471
The man or the boy?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.440
The father.
The boy had brown hair.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.209
I thought he was throwing
a temper tantrum.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.377
Ms. Lewis saw the guy

02:56.410 --> 02:59.480
force the kid into a red jacket
and a blue baseball cap.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.881
I'll get out a description
of the new clothes.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.716
Hey, did you see
where they went?
The subway.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.553
The kid was screaming
his lungs out.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.887
(woman's voice)
Sure I remember him.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.556
I was just clocking in.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.457
Kid was fighting
and kicking.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.392
His dad was trying
to buy a metro card

03:11.425 --> 03:13.661
out of that machine.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.496
Did he use paper
or plastic?
Machine's busted.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.498
Only takes plastic.
Got him.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.233
What time'd you
start work this morning?

03:19.267 --> 03:20.434
1:00.
It's Stabler.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.702
I need Transit Bureau to run

03:21.735 --> 03:23.437
a guy's credit card
and address.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.241
(kid)
I want my mom!
You're not my mom!

03:27.275 --> 03:28.576
(Man)
Shut up!
You do what I tell you!

03:28.609 --> 03:30.944
Hit it.

03:30.978 --> 03:31.979
Jeffrey Jackson!

03:32.012 --> 03:32.980
What the hell's going on?

03:33.013 --> 03:33.847
Jeffrey Jackson,

03:33.881 --> 03:35.449
get away from the boy,
stand over here.

03:35.483 --> 03:39.587
All right, step over here,
sweetheart.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.589
It's okay, Henry.
It's okay.

03:41.622 --> 03:42.456
Henry?

03:42.490 --> 03:43.491
Who's Henry?

03:52.666 --> 03:56.737
Elliot.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.738
It's not him.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.840
He's my stepson.

03:59.873 --> 04:00.908
I want all
your badge numbers.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.643
I'm gonna sue
your asses off.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.331
(Cragen)
Henry Morton's been missing
for three hours,

04:57.365 --> 04:59.567
and we've been chasing
the wrong kid.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.801
What else we got?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.035
Mom wasn't much help.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.871
Husband took her up
to Riverdale an hour ago.

05:03.904 --> 05:04.972
Liv and I'll
go out there.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.707
John, Fin, you coordinate
the search.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.709
Okay, get us something
with the kid's scent on it.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.811
I'll turn it into canine
as soon as we get the sample.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.380
We've gotta get
a new picture of Henry.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.348
The photo we've got
is a year old.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.819
(Stabler)
Is that Henry's most recent
picture?

05:18.852 --> 05:20.120
This was taken
six weeks ago.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.121
It looks more like him.

05:21.154 --> 05:21.989
Update the flyers.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.757
You find something
for the bloodhounds?

05:23.791 --> 05:25.025
Yes.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.495
Henry's socks
in the dirty laundry.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.062
This gonna be enough?
Yeah, that should
be fine.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.364
Listen, we'd like
to ask your wife

05:30.398 --> 05:31.331
a few more questions.

05:31.365 --> 05:34.602
I gave her a sedative
so she could sleep.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.538
I'm a psychiatrist.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.006
Any patients
with a grudge?

05:39.039 --> 05:40.641
No one's made
any threats.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.875
How 'bout violence
against children?

05:41.909 --> 05:44.111
No, just your
garden variety neurotics.

05:44.144 --> 05:44.978
Detectives?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.014
We've been canvassing
the neighbors.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.550
Kid next door saw a guy hanging
around this morning.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.586
(kid)
I was in our driveway,

05:52.620 --> 05:55.155
fixing my skateboard.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.158
Henry was playing
in his yard.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.993
The man was in a car
parked over there.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.962
Did you happen to notice
what he was wearing?

06:01.995 --> 06:04.432
A baseball cap
and sunglasses.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.500
He was watching Henry.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.402
Was the man black, white,
young, old?

06:08.436 --> 06:09.603
White.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.704
Can you describe the car?

06:10.738 --> 06:11.705
It looked like the Toyota

06:11.739 --> 06:13.474
my mom used to drive.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.708
(Stabler)
What color?

06:14.742 --> 06:15.709
Uh, black.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.577
Did you get a look at

06:16.610 --> 06:17.745
the license plate number
or the state?

06:17.778 --> 06:19.413
[sighs]

06:19.447 --> 06:20.781
I didn't look.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.783
I'm sorry, Dr. Morton.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.118
I wish I told my mom
this morning.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.554
It's okay, Jake.
You're helping us now.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.555
Thanks.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.723
Jake, listen...

06:29.757 --> 06:31.525
I know the research
on pedophiles.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.594
What's the chance my son
is still alive?

06:33.627 --> 06:34.962
You can't lose hope now.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.664
We're gonna get Jake's
description of the man

06:36.697 --> 06:38.098
out on the air,
we'll run the car,

06:38.131 --> 06:40.200
and we'll get these
to the canine unit.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.135
Where are these bloodhounds?

06:42.169 --> 06:43.437
Coming in from Coney Island.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.438
Another lost kid.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.706
ETA's an hour.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.641
We're gonna lose the light
and the scent trail.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.510
(Munch)
Search team just found
this in the gutter,

06:49.543 --> 06:51.144
six blocks from
the party place.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.514
Same size and brand
that Henry was wearing.
We need those dogs.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.182
(Stabler)
Well, I'm not gonna stand
around here waiting

06:55.215 --> 06:57.951
with my thumb up my ass.

06:57.985 --> 07:01.955
Maybe the sex offender unit
got a hit on the car, huh?

07:01.989 --> 07:03.591
(Monahan)
Your witness said an old black

07:03.624 --> 07:04.892
Toyota.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.794
Best I've got's a '95 Honda,
dark blue.

07:06.827 --> 07:07.795
I'll take it.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.096
I went back ten years.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.098
We could go further,
but this is a good hit.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.166
Billy Turner?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.068
Cases preschool playgrounds,
picks a kid,

07:15.102 --> 07:17.070
waits for the parents
to show up, follows them home.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.673
Now, our missing kid goes to
a preschool on the east side.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.208
Parole photo.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.643
Last time Billy
took a collar,

07:22.676 --> 07:24.211
he drove all the way up
to Hastings,

07:24.244 --> 07:26.714
grabbed a kid,
and fondled him in his car.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.115
Got out two months ago.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.082
These pervs just never stop.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.084
Now, it says he has
an apartment on Avenue B.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.986
Car's not registered
in his name?

07:33.020 --> 07:35.122
It belongs to mom.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.223
You worked Billy's case.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.891
Any idea where
he might've taken the kid?

07:37.925 --> 07:40.227
He works nights
at a plating shop.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.229
Closed on Sunday.
Could be there.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.231
Have the sector car
check out that shop.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.733
Me and my partner
are gonna hit his apartment.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.767
Thank you.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.204
(man)
I'll beat it out of you,
you son of a bitch!

07:51.238 --> 07:52.005
(man #2)
Please, don't hurt me!

07:52.039 --> 07:53.607
(man #1)
Tell me where he is!

07:53.641 --> 07:54.708
(man #2)
I don't know!

07:54.742 --> 07:56.209
Where is he?
I don't know!

07:56.243 --> 07:57.745
I'm gonna hurt you,
son of a bitch.
Wolinsky!

07:57.778 --> 07:58.912
Step away from him.
Now.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.213
What the hell
are you doing here?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.214
Looking for the kid.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.149
Where's Henry?

08:02.182 --> 08:03.851
I don't know.
I told this crazy bastard.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.519
Where did you stash him?

08:05.553 --> 08:06.687
It wasn't me, I swear.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.955
I'm cured.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.923
Officers, take him,
put him in the car.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.892
Wait outside for CSU.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.561
How'd you find out
about Billy?

08:13.594 --> 08:14.962
I heard you were looking
for him on police radio--

08:14.995 --> 08:16.296
You're done with this,
do you understand me?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.364
You are done with this.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.067
Yeah, after I file a complaint
for police brutality.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.969
You're lucky I don't
charge you with assault.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.303
I didn't touch
the baby raper.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.005
You trashed
this apartment.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.006
If Henry Morton was here,

08:26.039 --> 08:27.675
that means that you destroyed
a crime scene.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.042
You interfere again,
you're doing time.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.278
You take that perv scum's
side over me.

08:31.311 --> 08:35.048
I don't take anybody's side.
Get outta here.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.249
(Billy)
I never heard of this kid.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.586
I wasn't there.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.320
I don't have
those urges anymore.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.889
We know.
You're cured.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.024
I told ya.
I was at the laundromat.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.092
All morning?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.259
You musta had
a lot of clothes.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.260
(Stabler)
His name is Henry.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.261
He's five years old,

08:48.295 --> 08:49.096
same age as that boy

08:49.129 --> 08:51.832
you played doctor with
up in Hastings.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.667
What's a matter, Billy?
Don't you wanna look?

08:53.701 --> 08:54.735
I know you like
to look.

08:54.768 --> 08:55.736
My shrink says I can't.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.937
Yeah, but you want to.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.306
There ain't no doctor ever gonna
put out that sick fire, huh?

08:59.339 --> 09:00.307
(Benson)
Where's your car, Billy?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.274
I don't have one.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.343
Oh, that's right,
it's your mama's Honda.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.647
Does she know
what you do in that car?

09:06.680 --> 09:07.981
Does she know
that you take

09:08.015 --> 09:09.883
little boys for rides?
I don't do that anymore.

09:09.917 --> 09:10.851
Really?
'Cause I called your mama.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.320
No.
And she says
that you borrowed the car

09:13.353 --> 09:15.255
and you didn't
bring it back.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.256
It was stolen.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.691
(Stabler)
Or you dumped it

09:17.725 --> 09:19.092
because it was soaked
with Henry's blood.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.360
Your mom is gonna
be very disappointed

09:20.393 --> 09:21.629
when she finds out
that you're back

09:21.662 --> 09:22.630
to your old tricks again.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.164
You leave my mom
out of this!

09:24.197 --> 09:25.065
We will.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.334
As soon as you tell us
where Henry is.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.069
I don't know him.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.303
Witness saw you in your car

09:30.337 --> 09:32.740
outside that little boy's
house this morning.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.007
You don't know him?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.976
Billy, it's gonna be better
for everybody

09:36.009 --> 09:38.278
if you just tell us
the truth now.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.913
[knock at door]

09:39.947 --> 09:42.315
Fin just called.
Canine has a scent.

09:42.349 --> 09:46.353
Those bloodhounds are gonna
find that boy, Billy.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.221
You son of a bitch,

09:48.255 --> 09:50.257
we better find him alive.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.391
(Munch)
She picked up Henry's scent

09:51.424 --> 09:53.694
at the party place, and been
taking us North ever since.

09:53.727 --> 09:54.561
(Fin)
The pooch is cool.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.263
Gave her a sock,
went right to work.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.264
[dog barks]

09:57.297 --> 09:59.199
You want inside, Bridey-girl?

09:59.232 --> 10:01.001
I don't want her
off the leash.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.002
Pull her back a little.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.003
[dog barks]

10:03.036 --> 10:04.004
(Handler)
Yeah girl.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.305
We're gonna let you in.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.881
Call an ambulance.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.148
Not yet, Elliot.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.017
Call an ambulance.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.018
[dog barks]

10:18.051 --> 10:20.754
This is it.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.322
[dog whining]

10:22.355 --> 10:23.356
(Benson)
Henry.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.670
(Benson)
Dr. Warner will ask you
to make a positive ID.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.672
Will we recognize him?

10:38.706 --> 10:39.673
Yes.

10:39.707 --> 10:40.674
[mom cries]

10:40.708 --> 10:43.811
I can't do this.

10:43.844 --> 10:44.978
It's okay, honey.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.013
I'll do it.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.351
Are you ready?

10:51.384 --> 10:52.385
Yes.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.929
That's my son.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.201
Was, uh...

11:08.235 --> 11:09.703
Was he molested?

11:09.737 --> 11:11.371
No.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.073
Cause of death?

11:13.106 --> 11:14.942
Suffocation.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.812
I found small pebbles lodged
in his trachea.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.114
To silence him.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.983
What else?

11:23.016 --> 11:23.984
Brown animal hairs.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.285
Do you have cat,
Dr. Morton?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.920
No.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.823
Henry's allergic.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.992
I sent the pebbles
and hairs to the lab.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.762
CSU is checking
the apartment for matches.

11:34.795 --> 11:35.763
Apartment?

11:35.796 --> 11:36.797
Whose apartment?

11:36.830 --> 11:37.798
You have a suspect.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.166
Dr. Morton,

11:39.199 --> 11:42.302
as soon as we make an arrest,
I promise you,

11:42.335 --> 11:43.804
you'll be the first to know.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.805
I can handle it.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.006
(Benson)
But your wife can't.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.507
I think she needs you.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.742
Come on.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.747
I'm holding you
to that promise.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.215
You call me
the second you get

11:55.248 --> 11:57.417
the bastard
who murdered my son.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.522
(Dr. Warner)
I'm sorry.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.791
I blew it.

12:03.824 --> 12:04.758
I said too much.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.426
(Benson)
Can't blame you.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.461
I've never seen a dad
that composed.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.396
That guy is a time bomb.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.299
He keeps holding it in,
he's gonna explode.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.834
Let's go.

12:13.867 --> 12:14.835
Where?

12:14.868 --> 12:15.869
Back to Billy's apartment.

12:15.903 --> 12:16.837
Crime Scene's
got it covered.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.772
Let's make sure.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.008
Cat hair.
You can tell by the barb.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.009
Brown.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.443
(Stabler)
Where's the cat?

12:23.476 --> 12:24.444
No sign of it.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.813
No litter box, no cat food.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.314
Billy gets worried
about transfer evidence

12:27.347 --> 12:28.849
and he dumps the cat, too?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.350
You check the incinerator?

12:30.383 --> 12:31.351
And the dumpster
and the alley.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.419
What about the rocks?

12:32.452 --> 12:33.821
Uh, combed the rugs,

12:33.854 --> 12:35.055
checked the soles
of all his shoes.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.123
(Stabler)
You vacuum it?
Benson.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.358
No, we tweezed looking
for all your damn cat hairs.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.160
If the pebbles were here,
we would've found them.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.995
That was Munch.

12:42.029 --> 12:45.098
Billy's car was found
stripped and torched.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.001
Let's bring Jake O'Hara
in for a line up.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.169
Just take your time, Jake.

12:49.202 --> 12:53.273
There's no hurry.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.575
I-I think, uh...

12:55.608 --> 12:57.577
I think number three.

12:57.610 --> 13:01.348
Jake, are your sure?

13:01.381 --> 13:04.818
Or maybe two.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.253
Okay, well, just take
a look at all of 'em.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.188
Take a good look
and just focus.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.594
(Jake)
They all kinda look the same.

13:14.627 --> 13:18.465
But, uh...

13:18.498 --> 13:21.969
Three's the closest.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.203
That's great, Jake.
Thanks.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.537
I'll take you back
to your mom.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.941
Come on.

13:27.975 --> 13:28.942
Not bad.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.010
It's not good.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.311
You know as well as I do,

13:31.344 --> 13:33.513
any lawyer can shred
that idea on the stand.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.514
Cat hairs are gonna match.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.350
But it's still not enough
for an indictment.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.418
Break him.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.619
Or we gotta cut him loose.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.620
(Benson)
Our witness picked

13:40.653 --> 13:41.922
you out, Billy.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.023
Your witness is wrong!

13:43.056 --> 13:44.624
Cat hairs on the boy.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.894
Cat hairs in your apartment.

13:46.927 --> 13:47.961
I don't have a cat.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.596
The landlady's
cat wanders in--

13:49.629 --> 13:51.331
I don't wanna hear
about your landlady anymore!

13:51.364 --> 13:53.066
It's over!

13:53.100 --> 13:54.301
Now, you stalked
that little boy.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.635
You snatched him

13:55.668 --> 13:56.536
and you got into his pants

13:56.569 --> 13:58.371
and then you wanted
to keep him quiet,

13:58.405 --> 13:59.940
so you shoved rocks
down his throat

13:59.973 --> 14:01.108
until he choked to death.

14:01.141 --> 14:04.511
I never killed anyone.

14:04.544 --> 14:08.381
Only touched.

14:08.415 --> 14:13.353
Maybe I did something
I shouldn't have.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.654
Like what, Billy?

14:14.687 --> 14:15.655
Like what?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.324
If I violate my parole,

14:17.357 --> 14:18.926
they'll send me back inside.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.094
I don't want to go back.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.629
Okay--
That's why
I didn't tell you.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.597
I can talk to your parole
officer and make sure that--

14:24.631 --> 14:27.000
They'll send me back.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.135
I'll get raped
every single day.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.137
I'm gonna make sure that
that doesn't happen to you,

14:30.170 --> 14:35.642
but you have got to tell me
where you were.

14:35.675 --> 14:41.248
I'm not allowed
to be alone with kids.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.649
But she asked me.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.552
Who asked you?

14:45.585 --> 14:49.089
She needed me to baby-sit
her little boy.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.059
The lady who
lives next door.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.531
Billy's neighbor didn't ask him.
He volunteered.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.366
How old is the kid?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.101
Five, he said
Billy never touched him.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.102
But what about
the mother?

15:02.135 --> 15:03.603
She confirmed Billy's story.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.571
Left at 8:30,

15:04.604 --> 15:06.673
got back to the apartment
at half past 11:00.

15:06.706 --> 15:07.574
Could Billy have
left the kid

15:07.607 --> 15:09.709
alone for an hour
and then come back?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.211
No, the boy said
Billy was with him

15:11.244 --> 15:12.379
the whole three hours.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.081
Okay, so your witness

15:14.114 --> 15:16.583
puts Billy outside
the Morton home

15:16.616 --> 15:18.986
in Riverdale at 8:00 AM.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.588
But Billy's Alibi puts him

15:21.621 --> 15:24.224
back on Avenue B at 8:30.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.492
Tight, but doable.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.427
(Novak)
Well, then he's gotta
get back to Riverdale

15:27.460 --> 15:28.561
to follow Henry into
the birthday party.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.563
Henry's mom says
they left the house

15:30.597 --> 15:32.365
no later than
a quarter to 12:00.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.001
And Billy didn't finish
his babysitting gig

15:34.034 --> 15:36.336
in Manhattan
'til 11:30.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.437
Well, there's no way he got

15:37.470 --> 15:38.438
to Riverdale in 15 minutes,

15:38.471 --> 15:40.007
not even on a Sunday.

15:40.040 --> 15:40.974
We got the wrong guy.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.209
(Munch)
Looks that way.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.044
Lab says cat hairs
from Billy's apartment

15:44.077 --> 15:45.312
don't match the ones
on Henry Morton.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.546
(Novak)
We gotta let Billy go.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.680
We keep him here
much longer,

15:47.714 --> 15:50.717
we're gonna have
one hell of a lawsuit.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.987
I'll tell the perv
he's going home.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.455
(voice on megaphone)
Pervert out!

15:55.488 --> 15:56.489
[many voices chanting]
Pervert out!

15:56.523 --> 15:58.325
What the hell is this?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.027
Hey!

16:00.060 --> 16:02.162
Give a partner a hand
with him?

16:02.195 --> 16:03.630
Wolinsky.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.033
You need a permit
for the bullhorn

16:06.066 --> 16:07.167
and to be on the street.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.735
Now move it
onto the sidewalk.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.470
This is a peaceful protest.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.705
Do we want a pervert
in this neighborhood?

16:12.739 --> 16:13.706
[all]
No!

16:13.740 --> 16:14.707
We want him out.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.276
Last chance, Wolinsky.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.045
Break it up.
Now.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.712
We want the perv gone.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.515
Let's get him now!

16:22.549 --> 16:26.753
[many voices chanting]
We want him out!

16:26.786 --> 16:29.522
Pervert out!
Pervert out!

16:29.556 --> 16:31.491
All right, you're under arrest
for inciting a riot.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.559
Surround him
with your guys

16:32.592 --> 16:34.027
and get him into
the building.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.095
Wait until parole gets here.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.263
[phone rings]

16:36.296 --> 16:37.264
Benson.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.232
Bring this guy
to our squad.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.334
Thanks for making
me a hero.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.770
Yeah, we're on our way.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.004
Elliot, we gotta go.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.078
(O'Halloran)
Forensic geologist ID'd

16:51.111 --> 16:52.612
the pebbles
in Henry's trachea.

16:52.645 --> 16:53.713
Colorado quartz.

16:53.746 --> 16:54.814
Not indigenous
to this area.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.216
So they could be
from the alley

16:56.249 --> 16:57.217
where the body was found.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.218
I checked.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.219
Didn't find any.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.320
So you're saying the perp

17:00.353 --> 17:01.621
brought 'em in
from out of state?

17:01.654 --> 17:02.622
What I'm saying is

17:02.655 --> 17:04.191
the perp isn't
who you think it is.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.625
We dusted the pebbles.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.161
Stone's porous.
Got perfect prints.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.330
And they're not
Billy Turner's?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.631
Or any other adults.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.100
The fingers are too small.

17:13.133 --> 17:16.736
Has to be a child's.

17:16.769 --> 17:17.737
So Henry's.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.738
Nope.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.208
Don't match.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.342
You have those pebbles?

17:29.616 --> 17:31.184
Look familiar?

17:31.218 --> 17:32.785
Just like the ones from that
neighbor boy's front yard.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.321
Jake O'Hara.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.156
No wonder the kid was
such a good witness.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.562
(Novak)
We are gonna charge
a 13 year-old

17:42.595 --> 17:44.131
with Henry's murder?

17:44.164 --> 17:46.233
We better have
a smoking gun.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.767
We do, the stones
in Henry's throat.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.202
They were from Jake's
front yard.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.337
The prints are gonna be his.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.571
(Benson)
I bet if we go back to

17:51.604 --> 17:52.639
the party security tapes,

17:52.672 --> 17:54.174
we're gonna see Jake.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.708
We weren't looking
for a kid.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.610
What about that man
that Jake saw?

17:57.644 --> 17:59.279
Well, he must've
made that up.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.513
(Novak)
But Jake O'Hara
picked Billy Turner

18:00.547 --> 18:01.814
out of a line-up.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.383
How could he have
possibly known

18:03.416 --> 18:05.385
Billy was a pedophile?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.553
I don't know.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.487
All right, well,
let's not

18:07.520 --> 18:09.522
hardball the kid
'til we get some answers.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.824
We can't afford to make
the same mistake twice.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.660
(Jake's mom)
I thought my son answered

18:13.693 --> 18:14.561
all your questions.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.796
We just have to follow up
on a few things.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.199
Now, Jake, this man that you
picked out of the lineup.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.801
You mean the guy
who killed Henry.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.870
Actually,
he didn't do it.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.706
Told you I wasn't sure.

18:26.739 --> 18:30.143
It's okay, honey.
You did your best.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.245
I guess it was
number two after all.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.513
(Benson)
No, Jake.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.582
Number two was
an off-duty cop.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.250
I'm sorry.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.520
They all looked alike
with those sunglasses.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.623
I only saw the picture
for a minute.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.424
What picture?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.726
The guy you wanted me
to pick out.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.728
You never saw the man.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.331
Well, I did, but--

18:51.364 --> 18:52.565
I told that
other detective

18:52.599 --> 18:54.601
I wasn't sure
I'd recognize him again.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.902
That's when he showed me
the picture.

18:55.935 --> 18:56.903
What other detective?

18:56.936 --> 18:59.172
What was his name?

18:59.206 --> 19:00.473
I don't remember.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.574
Do you remember
what he looked like?

19:01.608 --> 19:04.411
He was kinda bald and...

19:04.444 --> 19:05.945
he had a mustache.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.715
I'll be right back.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.583
So what else did
this detective say to you?

19:10.617 --> 19:11.451
This is absurd.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.620
Don't you people
talk to each other?

19:13.653 --> 19:14.921
He just asked me
some questions.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.689
Can you remember
any of 'em?

19:16.723 --> 19:19.292
Same stuff
you guys asked me.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.727
Hey, that's him.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.663
'Scuse me.

19:23.696 --> 19:27.400
Detective, can I have
a word with you?

19:27.434 --> 19:28.901
What are you doin'?
What are you, crazy?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.537
You sent me on
a wild goose chase.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.904
Waste my time?
I was trying
to help you guys.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.473
You contaminated evidence!

19:33.506 --> 19:34.574
You tell that kid
you're a cop

19:34.607 --> 19:36.243
to get him to make
a false ID.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.677
You got the perv,
didn't you?

19:37.710 --> 19:39.746
Wrong perv.
I'll tell ya what.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.249
Where you're going, you'll be
meeting plenty of 'em.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.520
What's going on here?

19:47.554 --> 19:48.921
(Stabler)
What's going on,
Mrs. O'Hara,

19:48.955 --> 19:52.559
is Jake identified a man
he never saw.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.394
You made it all up,
didn't you, Jake?

19:54.427 --> 19:56.763
I did what the detective
told me to do.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.666
I'm sure it was
a misunderstanding.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.635
Well, there's a few other things
that we don't understand.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.238
Like why Henry
was covered up in cat hair.

20:05.272 --> 20:08.375
Or how these stones
from your yard

20:08.408 --> 20:10.710
were found in his throat.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.745
Henry must've
picked 'em up.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.747
Sweetheart,

20:14.781 --> 20:16.549
what are they
talking about?

20:16.583 --> 20:18.017
I don't know, Mom.
I swear.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.419
(Benson)
Sure you do, Jake.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.321
You knew that Henry's mom
was taking him

20:21.354 --> 20:22.789
to the birthday party.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.657
People saw you there.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.459
They also saw you
on the subway.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.328
And you wanna
know what else?

20:30.897 --> 20:35.268
The fingerprints
on these little stones

20:35.302 --> 20:36.736
are gonna match

20:36.769 --> 20:40.707
the ones on your soda can.

20:52.985 --> 20:56.289
I-I was scared.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.625
Henry saw me chasing
Mrs. Brody's cat

20:58.658 --> 21:01.861
and I fell on it
and it died.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.764
And Henry said
I killed the cat.

21:04.797 --> 21:08.635
And he was gonna tell on me.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.437
I didn't wanna go back
to that camp, but...

21:10.470 --> 21:12.872
I knew you'd send me

21:12.905 --> 21:14.073
if you thought
I killed the cat.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.409
Honey, I never
would have done that.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.510
You would!

21:17.544 --> 21:19.612
I knew you would.

21:19.646 --> 21:22.715
That's why I had
to stop him.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.816
I just wanted to talk to him,

21:23.850 --> 21:25.752
but he kept saying
he'd tell.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.887
And...

21:27.920 --> 21:29.055
I didn't mean to do it.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.923
I was just so scared.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.859
This is my fault
because I sent Jake

21:32.892 --> 21:33.926
to that camp
a month ago.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.662
What camp?

21:35.695 --> 21:36.663
It's a tough love place.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.531
They were supposed
to help him.

21:38.565 --> 21:41.501
Look at what they did to me.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.935
They burned me.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.904
They cut me.

21:44.937 --> 21:48.441
They stuck things in me.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.943
I'd rather be dead
than go back there.

21:50.977 --> 21:51.978
The other children
tortured him.

21:52.011 --> 21:52.879
If my son has done

21:52.912 --> 21:55.615
anything wrong,
it is because of what

21:55.648 --> 21:56.649
they put him through.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.556
Mrs. O'Hara, we still have
to place Jake

22:03.590 --> 22:05.425
under arrest.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.894
I'm calling a lawyer.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.499
(Henry's dad)
Jake killed Henry?

22:15.067 --> 22:16.736
He loves our boys.
He...

22:16.769 --> 22:18.070
He taught 'em how to throw
a Frisbee. He...

22:18.104 --> 22:21.007
He helped them build a fort
in the backyard.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.745
He confessed, Dr. Morton.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.714
I-I can't believe this.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.516
(Benson)
Did you know

22:29.549 --> 22:31.551
that his mother sent him
to a boot camp?

22:31.584 --> 22:32.785
Yes.

22:32.819 --> 22:33.820
Yes...

22:33.853 --> 22:34.921
Since Jake's father died,

22:34.954 --> 22:36.623
he's been acting out.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.524
Leslie was overwhelmed.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.026
I recommended a place
up in Rhinebeck.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.461
Why, what--

22:41.494 --> 22:44.063
It looks like he
was brutalized up there.

22:44.096 --> 22:47.166
Leslie never said
anything to me.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.935
What did they do to him?

22:48.968 --> 22:49.936
Jake said he was sodomized.

22:49.969 --> 22:50.937
And he showed us

22:50.970 --> 22:51.938
some scars where

22:51.971 --> 22:56.142
the other kids
had burned him.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.376
[groans]

23:01.981 --> 23:05.885
I need to see Jake.

23:05.918 --> 23:06.919
Please.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.959
(Judge)
I'll hear the people on bail.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.027
(Novak)
The people request
500,000, your honor.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.729
(female lawyer)
He's a child.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.098
I'd argue for house arrest
with an ankle bracelet.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.634
And I'd be comfortable
with a little more security.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.002
The bail is set
at 200,000.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.036
Cash or bonds.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.705
Let's take ten,
everybody.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.706
Casey.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.942
This is Brett Morton,

23:29.976 --> 23:31.611
Henry's father.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.179
I'm very sorry.

23:33.212 --> 23:36.048
Can I speak
with Jake?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.049
Uh, Cleo.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.851
Can we have
a minute, please?

23:45.157 --> 23:47.059
Dr. Morton.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.596
I'm so sorry.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.230
Henry was my friend.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.634
I know, Jake.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.203
Why'd you do it?

24:00.072 --> 24:03.743
I don't know.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.845
Something's wrong
with me.

24:05.878 --> 24:10.216
Jake,

24:10.249 --> 24:11.984
what did Henry say

24:12.018 --> 24:13.052
before he died?

24:16.122 --> 24:18.825
He said he wanted
his mommy.

24:28.701 --> 24:29.802
What's gonna happen to him?

24:29.836 --> 24:30.937
(Novak)
Without a plea bargain,

24:30.970 --> 24:32.739
he'll stand trial
and go to prison.

24:32.772 --> 24:33.740
Hmm.

24:33.773 --> 24:34.841
He's a juvenile.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.075
He'll be out at 18.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.910
Dr. Morton,

24:37.944 --> 24:39.846
we're trying Jake
as an adult.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.914
No.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.015
I lost a child.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.283
And I know one thing,
it's wrong

24:44.316 --> 24:46.218
to lose another child
to a life in prison.

24:46.252 --> 24:49.589
As a parent, I can't imagine
what you're going through.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.823
Well, putting Jake
in jail isn't justice.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.024
And sending him
to that camp

24:52.058 --> 24:53.993
doesn't make you responsible
for what he did.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.066
Jake's had a hard life.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.668
What he did isn't
entirely his fault.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.670
And that evidence
will be introduced

25:03.703 --> 25:04.771
at trial.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.606
I'm sure you have
the best intentions.

25:06.639 --> 25:10.276
But you're wrong.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.277
(Novak)
Maybe I am wrong.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.278
Brett Morton
is caught

25:12.311 --> 25:13.746
between his anger
and his guilt.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.114
What, just because he
recommended that camp?

25:15.147 --> 25:16.115
He feels responsible.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.850
He feels that if Jake
hadn't been abused there,

25:17.884 --> 25:19.018
Jake wouldn't
have killed Henry.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.787
What do you think?

25:20.820 --> 25:21.988
Jake suffered there,
you know?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.556
He was burned.
He was possibly raped.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.691
Well, lots of kids
are traumatized.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.658
They don't go out
and kill other kids.

25:25.692 --> 25:26.959
I mean, every time
they shoot up a school,

25:26.993 --> 25:29.195
we say it was because
they were bullied.
Sometimes they were.

25:29.228 --> 25:30.630
And the question is

25:30.663 --> 25:32.198
whether that's the reason
why Jake killed Henry.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.000
All right, what do you know
about this camp?

25:34.033 --> 25:35.835
Rhinebeck Survival.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.137
No incidents of hazing or
torture that I've heard of.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.939
None that you've heard of?

25:39.972 --> 25:42.575
The director is a psychiatrist
named Burt Gleason.

25:42.609 --> 25:43.943
I'm sure
he'll talk to us.

25:46.813 --> 25:47.914
(Gleason)
We should never
have admitted Jake

25:47.947 --> 25:48.915
in the first place.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.316
He's a very disturbed child.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.084
Isn't that what this camp
is for, Dr. Gleason?

25:52.118 --> 25:53.886
Children with
behavioral problems, yes.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.755
Not kids
with serious pathology.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.223
Which the abuse here
made worse.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.925
You mean the accusations
Jake made

25:58.958 --> 25:59.859
against his bunkmates.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.661
Well, Jake said those kids
were the ones

26:01.694 --> 26:02.829
with serious pathology.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.831
Judge for yourself.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.332
I'll arrange for you
to talk to them.

26:06.365 --> 26:07.800
(kid)
He's sick, man.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.035
He's crazy.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.603
Jake said you helped
torture him.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.672
We did it to him?

26:12.705 --> 26:14.907
Second day he's here,
we're down at the lake.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.108
He sneaks up,

26:16.142 --> 26:18.110
whacks me on the head
with a boat paddle.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.646
I almost drowned.

26:19.679 --> 26:20.713
Maybe he was just
goofin' around.

26:20.747 --> 26:21.781
You don't get it.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.683
He held my head
under water.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.084
He wanted me to die.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.086
When he finally let go,

26:27.119 --> 26:29.789
he said,
"Don't tell anybody or else."

26:29.822 --> 26:31.190
Or else what?

26:31.223 --> 26:32.959
Or else he'd kill me.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.895
Are you sure
he was serious?

26:35.928 --> 26:38.665
Jake wasn't kidding.
That psycho would do it.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.800
I told Dr. Gleason.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.969
What happened?

26:43.002 --> 26:45.071
Dr. Gleason
wouldn't believe me.

26:45.104 --> 26:49.676
Next night I find
a dead gopher in my bed.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.811
Only guy around here sick enough
to break a gopher's neck is--

26:51.844 --> 26:54.647
Jake.
He's the only one.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.382
(Novak)
You look like you could take
care of yourself.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.985
Couldn't.
'Til I started working out.

26:59.018 --> 27:01.387
Did it 'cause I was
afraid of him.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.388
Why?

27:02.421 --> 27:03.656
'Cause he's nuts, man.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.791
He would always say,

27:04.824 --> 27:06.225
"Oh, let's see
who's tougher."

27:06.258 --> 27:07.994
He'd take off his shirt,

27:08.027 --> 27:08.861
put his arm next to mine,

27:08.895 --> 27:10.329
and put a lit cigarette
in between.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.964
Jake says
you burned him.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.766
Man, I ain't no psycho.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.801
Jake would just stand there,

27:14.834 --> 27:15.968
hold a match in his fingers

27:16.002 --> 27:16.869
'til his skin went on fire.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.371
You could smell it.
And he just laughed.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.374
That dude is crazy.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.344
Jake O'Hara burned himself?

27:25.377 --> 27:27.046
The camp's director tried
to explain to Jake's mother

27:27.079 --> 27:28.881
that he should be
institutionalized.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.216
She didn't believe him.
She threatened a lawsuit.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.317
And then she took Jake home.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.119
He was thrown out of two private
schools in Brooklyn

27:33.152 --> 27:34.887
for violent behavior
and arson.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.355
His mom had to move him
to Riverdale.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.024
The kid's a sociopath.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.291
He's only 13.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.027
Well, he has all
the classic symptoms.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.028
He's glib.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.029
He lies.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.296
He had no remorse,
no empathy.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.364
He's narcissistic.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.999
And he's extremely manipulative.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.200
He fooled both of us.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.301
(Novak)
Even Brett Morton and

27:49.335 --> 27:50.302
he's also a psychiatrist.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.004
He lives right next door.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.040
He never saw how devious
Jake really is.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.175
If the boy
is mentally ill,

27:56.208 --> 27:57.944
we'll send him
to a hospital.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.011
(Huang)
Sociopathy is

27:59.045 --> 27:59.879
a personality disorder.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.814
A lot of shrinks believe
there's no cure.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.850
What do you believe?

28:03.883 --> 28:07.419
You can't grow
a conscience.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.022
(Novak)
Jake knew what he was doing

28:10.056 --> 28:11.457
was wrong and didn't care.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.026
It's the right decision
to try him as an adult.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.095
It's too late.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.029
(Novak)
Why?

28:17.063 --> 28:18.931
Dr. Morton came
to see me this morning.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.733
He begged me to send Jake
to Family Court.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.002
So I moved it.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.137
Case is being heard
right now.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.441
(judge)
The minor will be released

28:29.475 --> 28:31.911
into the custody
of his mother.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.480
Fact-finding will begin
tomorrow at 11:00.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.749
Initial reports
in my chamber today.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.050
I'm very sorry to interrupt,
Your Honor,

28:38.084 --> 28:39.151
but we've made
a mistake.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.486
That's refreshing.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.254
I don't often hear that
in my courtroom.

28:42.288 --> 28:44.957
The District Attorney's office
has reconsidered

28:44.991 --> 28:47.393
our decision to try Jake O'Hara
in Family Court.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.295
We request that the case be
moved to Supreme Court

28:49.328 --> 28:50.396
for trial as an adult.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.463
Hearings have begun.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.265
Jeopardy is attached.

28:53.299 --> 28:56.002
If I dismiss now,
the case is over.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.770
These are highly unusual
circumstances.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.171
Jake O'Hara lied
about his abuse.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.172
All of his injuries

29:00.206 --> 29:01.173
are self-inflicted.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.341
What are you saying?
Dr. Morton.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.010
We interviewed witnesses
at the camp.

29:04.043 --> 29:07.213
They all told us
Jake burned himself.

29:07.246 --> 29:10.049
I believed you.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.383
I fought for you.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.220
(judge)
Dr. Morton, sit down.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.521
You lying little bastard.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.223
The court officer
will remove Dr. Morton

29:17.256 --> 29:18.825
from this courtroom.
You little prick!

29:18.858 --> 29:21.527
You should rot in hell!

29:21.560 --> 29:23.129
(Stabler)
Let's go before
she locks you up.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.797
You bet I will.

29:24.831 --> 29:25.998
Get him out of here.

29:26.032 --> 29:26.999
Monster!

29:27.033 --> 29:28.034
You murdered my son!

29:31.037 --> 29:33.072
I don't believe
this is happening.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.173
I can't breathe.

29:34.206 --> 29:35.908
Let's go outside
and get some air. Relax.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.877
Do you understand?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.979
Jake will get out
when he's 18.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.848
He's a sociopath.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.282
He will kill again.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.017
And again
and again.

29:45.051 --> 29:48.487
I'm sorry
for what happened, sir.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.157
I really am.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.158
You're not sorry.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.292
You don't know
what sorry means.

29:53.325 --> 29:56.295
You have no feelings!

29:56.328 --> 29:57.396
Leave my son alone.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.338
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!

30:06.372 --> 30:08.374
Oh no!
Oh no!

30:31.964 --> 30:35.434
I knew the guy
was wound too tight.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.369
Shoulda seen it coming.

30:37.403 --> 30:38.404
(Cragen)
You didn't know Morton

30:38.437 --> 30:39.538
would shoot him.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.974
We all thought
Jake was a victim.

30:42.008 --> 30:45.211
The kid snowed everyone.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.113
Elliot.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.448
Jake's dead.

30:49.481 --> 30:53.352
He never made it
out of surgery.

30:53.385 --> 30:54.987
Olivia.

30:55.021 --> 30:58.090
Don't.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.263
How could you
let this happen?

31:04.296 --> 31:05.264
You got some nerve, lady.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.332
That kid was killed

31:06.365 --> 31:08.067
because you sent him
to Family Court.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.468
I didn't stand there

31:09.501 --> 31:11.370
and watch Brett Morton
grab a gun.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.139
You sure as hell put it
in his hand.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.907
What, you didn't wanna say no
to a grieving father?

31:14.941 --> 31:16.408
You afraid the press would call
you a cold-hearted bitch.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.444
If you two wanna blame
each other, go ahead.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.146
But I have a job to do.

31:20.179 --> 31:23.950
Now, what's our decision
on Dr. Morton?

31:23.983 --> 31:25.151
Charge him.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.318
Murder 2.

31:26.352 --> 31:29.388
His son was killed by a
psychopath who was gonna walk.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.423
And that gives him
the right to kill a kid?

31:31.457 --> 31:35.527
I want him arraigned
by tomorrow morning.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.529
And you're just gonna
cover her ass, huh?

31:37.563 --> 31:39.065
Just sweep it all
under the carpet.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.666
My job is not
to protect my boss.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.568
Then do the right thing.
You saw Morton.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.403
The guy was out of his mind.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.572
It's not Murder 2,
it's Manslaughter.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.982
How's Jake?

31:56.015 --> 31:58.150
He died in surgery.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.218
What have I done?

31:59.251 --> 32:00.719
(Zierko)
You were out
of control, Brett.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.188
You didn't know
what you were doing.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.956
If this isn't "extreme
emotional disturbance",

32:03.990 --> 32:05.491
I don't know what it is.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.459
So you're going
for an affirmative defense.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.261
What do you want?

32:09.295 --> 32:11.163
Man 2.
Minimum time.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.431
I have a better idea.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.000
Why don't we just
throw him a parade?

32:14.033 --> 32:15.701
I don't like your tone.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.003
I don't like 13 year-olds

32:17.036 --> 32:19.338
being shot to death
in the courthouse.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.007
You think I meant
to do it?

32:21.040 --> 32:22.008
You grabbed
a court officer's gun

32:22.041 --> 32:23.075
and pulled the trigger.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.511
I don't remember
any of it.

32:25.544 --> 32:26.412
I just snapped.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.414
Well, that's convenient.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.581
No, that's "extreme
emotional disturbance".

32:29.615 --> 32:30.582
Well, you'll have to

32:30.616 --> 32:31.984
forgive me if I don't take

32:32.018 --> 32:33.085
your client's word for it.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.220
Fine.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.388
Have your psychiatrist
examine him.

32:38.757 --> 32:41.760
(Huang)
Do you recall
your state of mind

32:41.793 --> 32:44.063
after you shouted at Jake?

32:44.096 --> 32:46.565
I walked out
of the courtroom...

32:46.598 --> 32:49.368
Nothing seemed real.

32:49.401 --> 32:52.304
Detective Stabler
was talking.

32:52.338 --> 32:55.574
I couldn't understand
what he was saying.

32:55.607 --> 33:00.112
And what's the next thing
that you remember happening?

33:00.146 --> 33:02.781
Jake.
Lying on the floor.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.684
Blood everywhere.

33:05.717 --> 33:09.388
The smell from the gun.

33:09.421 --> 33:10.322
My heart...

33:10.356 --> 33:14.793
beating so fast
I thought it would explode.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.763
I-I know I shot Jake.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.631
Because the gun
was in my hand.

33:19.665 --> 33:20.732
I just don't know
how it got there.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.401
Dr. Morton,

33:22.434 --> 33:24.670
when you heard that Jake had
lied about being abused,

33:24.703 --> 33:28.040
what went through your mind?

33:28.074 --> 33:29.408
I had to get out of there.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.177
I-I had to go outside
and get some air.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.744
I couldn't breathe.

33:32.778 --> 33:36.748
And that's
when you saw Jake.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.050
I wasn't thinking
about killing him.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.786
What were
you thinking about?

33:44.690 --> 33:47.626
My son's face.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.361
The last time
in the morgue.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.534
His last words.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.569
I can hear him crying
for his mother.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.312
Well, does Brett Morton
have a valid defense?

34:06.345 --> 34:07.813
Well, it's a textbook
presentation

34:07.846 --> 34:09.781
of "extreme emotional
disturbance."

34:09.815 --> 34:11.750
Memory loss,
vivid sensory recall.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.652
He's got all
the psychological symptoms.

34:13.685 --> 34:14.653
I hear
a "but" coming.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.255
It's almost
too perfect.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.356
Okay.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.557
Morton's a psychiatrist.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.492
He knows exactly
what to say.

34:20.526 --> 34:21.760
Yeah, but just 'cause
someone could be faking

34:21.793 --> 34:22.794
doesn't mean that he is.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.831
So should
I plead him out?

34:25.864 --> 34:27.699
I can't tell you
what to do.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.735
What Morton went through
was unimaginable.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.437
That kind of tragedy...

34:31.470 --> 34:33.272
I sympathize
with him.

34:33.305 --> 34:34.406
But you still have doubts.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.776
It's a tough call, Casey.

34:39.878 --> 34:42.548
(Dr. Morton)
I was out of my mind
with grief.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.350
I never would
have shot Jake O'Hara

34:44.383 --> 34:47.819
if I'd been
thinking straight.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.222
Now, let's be clear
about this.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.391
You testified
you had no specific knowledge

34:52.424 --> 34:53.759
of the incident itself.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.627
But you do admit
you killed him.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.396
I don't remember
doing it.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.630
But I know I did.

34:58.664 --> 34:59.865
I can't excuse it.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.234
I can't explain it away.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.336
And I'll live with the pain
of that knowledge

35:04.370 --> 35:05.804
the rest of my life.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.239
(Zierko)
Thank you.

35:07.273 --> 35:10.309
No further questions.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.278
(judge)
Ms. Novak, we're waiting.

35:19.185 --> 35:21.453
You don't remember
grabbing the gun?

35:21.487 --> 35:24.256
You don't remember
shooting Jake O'Hara.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.324
But do you remember

35:25.357 --> 35:28.827
telling Detective Stabler
that Jake was a sociopath?

35:28.860 --> 35:31.197
No, I don't.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.365
Or saying that Jake would kill
again when he got out of jail?

35:33.399 --> 35:35.201
I was overwhelmed.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.202
I don't know...

35:36.235 --> 35:37.135
what I said.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.770
But did you think
that Jake was a sociopath?

35:38.804 --> 35:42.208
Sociopathy can't be
diagnosed in children.

35:42.241 --> 35:45.444
The DSM-4 prohibits it.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.413
Until 18,
children can

35:47.446 --> 35:49.448
only be treated
for conduct disorder.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.749
But you don't agree.

35:50.782 --> 35:54.520
Well, I adhere to
the standards of my profession.

35:54.553 --> 35:55.754
Your Honor, at this time,

35:55.787 --> 35:57.756
I'd like to introduce
into evidence

35:57.789 --> 36:00.592
an article from
the December 1992 issue

36:00.626 --> 36:03.929
of Adolescent Behavior.

36:03.962 --> 36:05.497
(judge)
Counselor?

36:05.531 --> 36:07.233
No objection.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.468
Dr. Morton.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.838
Would you please read
the first highlighted passage?

36:12.871 --> 36:15.274
If we fail to incarcerate
these killer kids

36:15.307 --> 36:16.842
for the rest
of their natural lives,

36:16.875 --> 36:17.943
they will surely
kill again.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.645
(Novak)
And now the second one.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.946
The American Psychiatric

36:20.979 --> 36:22.881
Association does not let us

36:22.914 --> 36:24.783
label these children
as sociopaths.

36:24.816 --> 36:27.419
But that does not change
who and what they are.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.520
They are born that way,

36:28.554 --> 36:29.655
and we must take
whatever

36:29.688 --> 36:32.324
measures are necessary
to protect society

36:32.358 --> 36:34.260
from these amoral predators.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.894
Who wrote that, Doctor?

36:35.927 --> 36:37.863
I did.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.799
But that was
nearly 15 years ago.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.234
My views have changed.

36:42.268 --> 36:43.369
Have they?

36:43.402 --> 36:45.003
Because what you told
Detective Stabler

36:45.036 --> 36:46.705
right before you shot
Jake O'Hara

36:46.738 --> 36:47.706
sounds like the passage

36:47.739 --> 36:48.574
you just read.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.409
All I meant was
we should find a way

36:50.442 --> 36:52.010
to protect people
from sociopathic children.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.879
And you found one,
didn't you?

36:53.912 --> 36:55.514
Objection.
Sustained.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.849
I didn't say
we should kill them.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.351
But if children
like Jake

36:59.385 --> 37:01.720
can't be treated,

37:01.753 --> 37:03.455
what's the alternative?

37:03.489 --> 37:04.756
Incarcerate them.

37:04.790 --> 37:05.857
For the rest
of their lives.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.726
That's what I believe.

37:07.759 --> 37:08.927
But on that day
in court,

37:08.960 --> 37:13.799
I wasn't thinking
like a psychiatrist.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.835
I was a grieving father.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.837
(Stabler)
You really went
after Morton in there.

37:18.870 --> 37:19.838
He killed a kid.

37:19.871 --> 37:20.906
He knew what he was doing.

37:20.939 --> 37:21.907
You're so sure
about that

37:21.940 --> 37:23.375
because of something
he wrote

37:23.409 --> 37:24.943
15 years ago?

37:24.976 --> 37:26.945
Elliot,
he's screwing with us.

37:26.978 --> 37:27.946
This grief-crazed
father crap--

37:27.979 --> 37:28.780
It's all an act.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.016
I spend my life locking
up skells

37:31.049 --> 37:31.883
for murdering children.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.320
System says they go
away to prison.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.887
Fine.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.924
But if it were my son
lying on that slab,

37:38.957 --> 37:40.992
I don't know what my rage
would make me do.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.861
(woman)
Detective Stabler?

37:42.894 --> 37:45.464
Yeah?

37:45.497 --> 37:46.898
You're served.

37:48.534 --> 37:51.670
Subpoena.

37:51.703 --> 37:54.440
Zierko's calling me to testify
for the defense.

37:54.473 --> 37:55.707
(Zierko)
Detective Stabler,

37:55.741 --> 37:57.443
can you describe Dr. Morton's
emotional state

37:57.476 --> 38:00.512
when he identified
his son's body.

38:00.546 --> 38:01.780
Calm.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.782
Detached.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.951
In your experience,

38:05.984 --> 38:08.053
is this unusual?

38:08.086 --> 38:10.055
Unusual, yeah.

38:10.088 --> 38:12.057
Were you concerned?

38:12.090 --> 38:14.059
[clears throat]

38:14.092 --> 38:14.860
Well, I thought that

38:14.893 --> 38:16.928
if you hold your grief
in like that,

38:16.962 --> 38:18.029
at some point,
you're gonna blow.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.030
And that's

38:19.064 --> 38:21.467
exactly what happened.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.436
Nothing further.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.405
Detective Stabler,

38:26.438 --> 38:28.374
you just testified
that Dr. Morton

38:28.407 --> 38:29.675
was in control of his emotions

38:29.708 --> 38:31.610
throughout the investigation.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.044
So would it be fair to say

38:33.078 --> 38:35.514
that he acted more
like a calm, detached doctor

38:35.547 --> 38:38.350
than a grieving father?

38:38.384 --> 38:40.786
Up until that day
at Family Court, yes.

38:40.819 --> 38:41.787
And in that hallway,

38:41.820 --> 38:44.556
right before he shot
Jake O'Hara,

38:44.590 --> 38:46.758
what did the defendant
say to you?

38:46.792 --> 38:48.894
He said Jake was a sociopath

38:48.927 --> 38:50.362
and that he would kill again.

38:50.396 --> 38:52.698
Does that sound like
a father talking?

38:52.731 --> 38:54.332
Or a psychiatrist?

38:56.902 --> 38:57.869
Psychiatrist.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.137
And one

38:59.170 --> 39:01.039
who's written
that sociopathic children

39:01.072 --> 39:02.441
cannot be cured.

39:02.474 --> 39:03.642
So.

39:03.675 --> 39:04.910
I ask you, based on

39:04.943 --> 39:07.112
your 12 years experience
as a detective,

39:07.145 --> 39:08.780
would you say the killing
of Jake O'Hara

39:08.814 --> 39:10.382
was the act of
a grief-crazed father

39:10.416 --> 39:13.351
or a calculated,
deliberate execution?

39:16.422 --> 39:18.524
I don't know.

39:24.463 --> 39:25.431
(Zierko)
So put yourself

39:25.464 --> 39:27.399
in Brett Morton's place.

39:27.433 --> 39:30.101
Imagine what it was like
in that hallway.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.070
The person
who murdered your son

39:32.103 --> 39:33.505
standing in front
of you.

39:33.539 --> 39:34.840
A disturbed young man

39:34.873 --> 39:36.442
who killed your child

39:36.475 --> 39:39.945
without mercy,
without remorse.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.414
He'll be getting
out of jail at 18.

39:42.448 --> 39:47.018
A birthday your child
will never celebrate.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.654
Could you lose control?

39:48.687 --> 39:50.756
We all could.

39:50.789 --> 39:53.425
We could lose sight
of our beliefs and values.

39:53.459 --> 39:55.461
Lose control
for one moment,

39:55.494 --> 39:57.529
and act blindly

39:57.563 --> 39:59.130
out of raw grief

39:59.164 --> 40:01.700
and despair.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.002
That's what Dr. Morton did.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.438
And the law says,

40:06.472 --> 40:08.607
that's not murder.

40:18.484 --> 40:19.751
None of us can imagine

40:19.785 --> 40:22.721
enduring Brett Morton's grief.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.956
But grief is not
what drove him

40:24.990 --> 40:26.558
to murder.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.594
He acted,
not out of emotion,

40:28.627 --> 40:29.995
but out of his
professional knowledge

40:30.028 --> 40:32.731
and experience.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.533
His act wasn't irrational.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.768
In fact, it was perfectly
consistent

40:36.802 --> 40:38.203
with his long-held belief

40:38.236 --> 40:40.506
that sociopathic children

40:40.539 --> 40:42.007
cannot be cured.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.910
Jake O'Hara
pretended

40:44.943 --> 40:47.646
remorse for the murder
of Henry Morton.

40:47.679 --> 40:48.714
And when
the defendant learned

40:48.747 --> 40:51.783
that Jake was a devious
and manipulative child,

40:51.817 --> 40:53.485
he also began to pretend.

40:53.519 --> 40:56.955
He pretended he lost control.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.557
He didn't.

40:58.590 --> 41:02.227
Not for a single second.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.162
He waited
for the perfect opportunity.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.964
Grabbed the court officer's gun,

41:05.997 --> 41:07.933
and then shot a child.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.901
That is not "extreme emotional
disturbance."

41:09.935 --> 41:10.969
It's murder,

41:11.002 --> 41:14.239
and you must
hold him responsible.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.514
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

41:22.548 --> 41:24.816
(woman)
We have, Your Honor.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.652
On the charge of Murder
in the Second degree,

41:26.685 --> 41:28.687
how does the jury find?

41:28.720 --> 41:29.655
We find the defendant

41:29.688 --> 41:30.756
not guilty.

41:30.789 --> 41:33.692
The court thanks the jury

41:33.725 --> 41:35.093
for their service.

41:35.126 --> 41:36.528
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:36.562 --> 41:37.729
you are dismissed.

41:37.763 --> 41:39.631
This court is now adjourned.

41:39.665 --> 41:40.666
[gavel knocks]

42:07.225 --> 42:08.927
And I think
the jury understood.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.662
I'll always regret
what I did.

42:10.696 --> 42:11.897
(Stabler)
I didn't think
they'd acquit him.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.965
Well, this trial wasn't
about Brett Morton

42:13.999 --> 42:15.834
or "extreme emotional
disturbance"

42:15.867 --> 42:17.603
or even your testimony.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.204
Jurors didn't want Jake O'Hara
running loose

42:19.237 --> 42:20.672
and Brett solved
that problem.

42:20.706 --> 42:22.608
We can't treat these kids,
so we kill 'em?

42:22.641 --> 42:23.942
I don't have
the answers.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.310
I don't think
anyone does.

42:25.343 --> 42:26.678
Maybe that's why
they acquitted.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.747
(Dr. Morton)
Ms. Novak.

42:28.780 --> 42:31.016
Ms. Novak.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.784
You seem
pretty satisfied.

42:32.818 --> 42:34.653
I am.

42:34.686 --> 42:36.354
Well, you got
away with it.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.623
Oh, I suppose I did.

42:37.656 --> 42:38.724
Tell me one thing.

42:38.757 --> 42:41.760
When did you decide
to kill Jake?

42:41.793 --> 42:45.296
In the courtroom.

42:45.330 --> 42:47.766
Once I knew
what he was.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.635
You were right.

42:49.668 --> 42:51.002
I looked around,

42:51.036 --> 42:52.671
saw the officer,

42:52.704 --> 42:54.973
realized I could
take the gun.

42:55.006 --> 42:58.744
I just waited
for the right moment.

42:58.777 --> 43:02.180
You manipulated us
just like Jake did.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.082
There's one big difference.

43:04.115 --> 43:06.952
Jake would've killed again.

43:06.985 --> 43:09.587
I won't.
