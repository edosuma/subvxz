Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.333 --> 00:04.834
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DID GET PREGNANT
LAST SEMESTER.

00:04.834 --> 00:06.125
I HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

00:06.125 --> 00:08.083
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT HAVING SEX YET--

00:08.083 --> 00:09.959
THERE ARE
CERTAIN THINGS
THAT WE CAN DO.

00:09.959 --> 00:12.166
PERHAPS
I COULD JUST--

00:12.166 --> 00:14.500
[LAUGHING] NO, NO,
PACEY! PACEY, NO,
PACEY, STOP!

00:14.500 --> 00:16.708
YOU KNOW MS. SWANSON,
THE COLLEGE ADVISOR?
YEAH.

00:16.708 --> 00:18.875
SHE ACTUALLY
CALLED HARVARD FOR ME!

00:18.875 --> 00:20.625
YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE MADE A DECISION.

00:20.625 --> 00:22.166
I CAN'T HAVE THE BABY.

00:22.166 --> 00:22.667
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.792
Jen: ECSTASY.

00:24.792 --> 00:25.834
I THOUGHT
I MADE MY FEELINGS

00:25.834 --> 00:27.083
PERFECTLY CLEAR
ON THIS SUBJECT.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.250
WHICH LED ME
TO SUSPECT

00:28.250 --> 00:31.083
THE LADY WAS
PROTESTING TOO MUCH.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.166
Andie: LOOK, I KNOW
HOW OVERWHELMING

00:35.166 --> 00:36.959
THE COLLEGE APPLICATION
THING CAN BE.

00:36.959 --> 00:38.125
BUT THE WAY
I GOT THROUGH IT

00:38.125 --> 00:39.041
IS TO TAKE IT
STEP BY STEP.

00:39.041 --> 00:41.333
SO, LET'S
JUST TAKE A STEP

00:41.333 --> 00:43.041
OVER TO THE COLLEGE-BOUND
REFERENCE SECTION

00:43.041 --> 00:44.250
AND START
PULLING DOWN
A FEW BOOKS.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.208
YEAH.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.333
HEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT MIGHT BE FUN?

00:46.333 --> 00:47.291
UH, WHAT?

00:47.291 --> 00:48.542
START FOCUSING
ON SCHOOLS

00:48.542 --> 00:49.917
THAT ARE IN NEW YORK
SINCE IT'S
YOUR OLD HOOD.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.291
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST SPENT 3 YEARS

00:52.291 --> 00:54.375
TRYING TO FLUSH
THE BIG APPLE
OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

00:54.375 --> 00:55.083
YEAH, BUT HAVEN'T YOU
RECENTLY DECIDED

00:55.083 --> 00:57.166
YOU MIGHT
WANNA GO BACK?

00:57.166 --> 00:58.250
HUH! WELL,
AS YOU'RE SO FOND
OF POINTING OUT,

00:58.250 --> 01:01.000
I--I HAVEN'T
RECENTLY DECIDED
ANYTHING.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.208
WELL, WHAT
ABOUT YOUR RUSH

01:02.208 --> 01:04.083
TO REJOIN THE GANG
AT THE, UH, HAUNT?

01:04.083 --> 01:07.041
HAS DREW
BEEN WHISPERING
IN YOUR EAR?

01:07.041 --> 01:08.041
WELL, ACTUALLY,
WE DID HAVE
A LITTLE CONFAB

01:08.041 --> 01:10.375
AT THE YACHT CLUB
LAST WEEK.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.083
HE WAS TELLING ME
ALL ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR SOCIAL SET

01:12.083 --> 01:13.041
AND HOW YOU GUYS
USED TO SPEND
ALL OF YOUR TIME

01:13.041 --> 01:14.208
AT THE HAUNT
DANCING AND DRINKING

01:14.208 --> 01:16.291
UNTIL THE WEE HOURS
OF THE MORNING.

01:16.291 --> 01:19.291
ACCORDING TO HIM,
IT WAS A NON-STOP
BALL OF FUN.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.667
MM. WELL, "ACCORDING
TO HIM" WOULD BE
THE KEY PHRASE.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.875
HE'S THE DARK PRINCE
OF REVISIONIST
HISTORY.

01:25.417 --> 01:26.917
I FOUND YOU. OK,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
STILL HERE.

01:26.917 --> 01:28.792
WHY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:28.792 --> 01:30.917
OH, NOTHING MUCH,
ACTUALLY.
IT'S JUST, UH--

01:30.917 --> 01:32.041
WELL, THERE'S
THIS ONE THING--

01:32.041 --> 01:33.458
UH,
THERE'S SOMETHING
WAITING AT THE HOUSE

01:33.458 --> 01:34.750
FOR YOU ALL DAY,
AND, UH,

01:34.750 --> 01:36.917
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT REALLY
THAT IMPORTANT.

01:36.917 --> 01:37.834
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE LETTER
FROM A KNOW-NOTHING

01:37.834 --> 01:40.250
NOR'EASTERN SCHOOL.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.250
SO, YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT WANNA
TAKE A GLANCE AT IT.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.583
IT'S FROM SOME PLACE

01:43.583 --> 01:45.041
CALLED, UM, HARVARD.

01:45.041 --> 01:48.250
OHH! HARVARD!
OH! OH, MY GOSH, OK!

01:48.250 --> 01:51.917

IN AN ENVELOPE.

01:51.917 --> 01:53.750
OH, GOD, OR NOT!

01:53.750 --> 01:55.458
IF IT WAS A YES,
IT WOULD BE BIGGER,
RIGHT?

01:55.458 --> 01:56.875
I MEAN,
THIS IS A CASE

01:56.875 --> 01:58.250
WHERE SIZE REALLY
DOES MATTER, RIGHT?

01:58.250 --> 02:00.583
WELL, I THINK
THAT SIZE
ONLY MATTERS

02:00.583 --> 02:01.750
WHEN YOU HAVE
A FULL VIEW

02:01.750 --> 02:04.875
OF THE ENTIRE
PACKAGE, REALLY.

02:04.875 --> 02:05.750

WHY MY SKIN CRAWLS

EVERY TIME
YOU'RE AROUND ME.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.583

BECAUSE I REMIND YOU
OF WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

09:05.583 --> 09:07.708
COME ON, JEN, FACE IT.
YOU NEED STIMULI.

09:07.708 --> 09:08.917

TO ASK FOR IT.

FOR A WHILE,

09:12.041 --> 09:15.959

17:31.208 --> 17:34.291
NO. UH,
JUST GIRL TALK.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.875
MM-HMM. WELL,
I'M GLAD YOU STOPPED
WHEN I GOT HERE.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.458
SHALL WE, UH,
VAMANOS?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.333
YEAH.

17:45.250 --> 17:48.500
OKAY, COME ON.
NOT HERE.
LATER, LATER.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.125
Dawson: COULD THEY
MAKE THIS ANY CREEPIER?

17:51.125 --> 17:52.417
Gretchen: I'LL BE
YOUR MAP POINT
BUDDY.

17:52.417 --> 17:54.041
COME ON.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.542
Pacey: WHEN
DID THEY BECOME

18:02.542 --> 18:05.542
GOING-OUT-TOGETHER
BUDDIES?

18:05.542 --> 18:08.792
I BELIEVE THIS
IS THE INAUGURAL EVENT.

18:08.792 --> 18:09.917
SO, THEN OF ALL
THE GUYS IN CAPESIDE

18:09.917 --> 18:11.166
THAT WANNA
BEFRIEND HER,
SHE PICKS DAWSON.

18:11.166 --> 18:14.417
THAT DOESN'T
BOTHER YOU AT ALL?

18:14.417 --> 18:17.208
PACE, HE'S
THE ONLY PERSON
CLOSE TO HER AGE

18:17.208 --> 18:18.417
WORKING
AT THE RESTAURANT.

18:18.417 --> 18:20.417
MAKES PERFECT SENSE
THAT THEY'D BECOME FRIENDS.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.834
NO. I ASKED
IF IT BOTHERED YOU.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.583
NO. IT DOESN'T
BOTHER ME.

18:24.583 --> 18:25.417
TSK! IT BOTHERS YOU.

18:25.417 --> 18:29.125
HEH! NO,
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

18:29.125 --> 18:31.625
IT--

18:31.625 --> 18:32.542
BOTHERS YOU.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.959
YOU JUST WANT IT
TO BOTHER ME, TOO.

18:34.959 --> 18:36.250
SO THEN
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

18:36.250 --> 18:38.708
YOU.

18:38.708 --> 18:40.625
[LAUGHS]

18:43.041 --> 18:47.291
NOW, WHY
ARE YOU HERE?

18:47.291 --> 18:50.458
TO HAVE
A GREAT NIGHT?

18:50.458 --> 18:52.333
EXACTLY! RIGHT ON!

18:52.333 --> 18:54.041
ALL RIGHT, UM,
5 BUCKS A BODY.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.166
WE'LL TAKE 4.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.458
FOLLOW THE YELLOW
BRICK ROAD.

19:04.625 --> 19:05.417
NOW THAT I
HAVE YOU ALONE,

19:05.417 --> 19:07.375
TELL ME,
IS IT JUST A FRONT,

19:07.375 --> 19:08.542
OR ARE YOU REALLY OK

19:08.542 --> 19:09.667
WITH THE JOEY-PACEY
COMPONENT
OF THE EVENING?

19:09.667 --> 19:12.959
UH, IT'S
A LITTLE AWKWARD,
I'M NOT GONNA LIE,

19:12.959 --> 19:14.250
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M IN TOO GOOD
OF A MOOD

19:14.250 --> 19:15.333
TO LET IT BOTHER ME.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.417
IS THAT WHY YOU
CHANGED YOUR MIND?

19:17.417 --> 19:18.750
UH...YEAH.

19:18.750 --> 19:22.792
ACTUALLY, UM,

19:22.792 --> 19:24.667
MY PARENTS DECIDED
TO HAVE THE BABY.

19:24.667 --> 19:28.083
WOW! OH, DAWSON,
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

19:28.083 --> 19:28.959
GOOD, GOOD. I WANTED
TO TELL YOU RIGHT AWAY,

19:28.959 --> 19:31.125
BUT IN LIGHT OF--

19:31.125 --> 19:32.875
YOU KNOW, I--I DIDN'T
WANNA RUIN THE EVENING.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.041
OH, NO. NO,
YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY

19:35.041 --> 19:36.458
TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS.
YOU HAVE TO.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.500
OK. GOOD,
BECAUSE I--I--

19:38.500 --> 19:41.625
I REALLY WANTED
TO SHARE IT
WITH SOMEBODY, AND--

19:41.625 --> 19:43.500
I AM SO EXCITED
ABOUT THIS.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.834
AS YOU SHOULD BE.

19:44.834 --> 19:47.208
I MEAN, HEY,
AS IRRITATING
AS THEY ARE,

19:47.208 --> 19:48.917
YOUNGER SIBLINGS
DO HAVE
THEIR PLUSES.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.375
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE GOOD
FOR DOING CHORES,

19:50.375 --> 19:51.959
AND THERE'S ALWAYS
SOMEONE TO BLAME

19:51.959 --> 19:53.417
IF ANYTHING
GETS BROKEN.

19:53.417 --> 19:54.750
[BOTH LAUGH]

19:54.750 --> 19:56.917
UM, THANK YOU.

19:56.917 --> 19:58.917
FOR SHARING
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.

19:58.917 --> 20:00.250
IT REALLY
HELPED ME UNDERSTAND

20:00.250 --> 20:02.125
WHAT MY PARENTS
WERE GOING THROUGH

20:02.125 --> 20:03.375
FROM THE RIGHT
PERSPECTIVE.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.875
YEAH, WELL,
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I'M GOOD FOR,

20:05.875 --> 20:08.041
IT'S A LITTLE
ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.250
HEH HEH HEH!

20:10.250 --> 20:11.750
COME ON!

20:23.625 --> 20:25.708
AW, MAN,
THIS IS AWESOME!

20:25.708 --> 20:27.750
RAVE TIME
HAS ARRIVED!

20:30.708 --> 20:32.375
HEY, ANDIE, UM,

20:32.375 --> 20:33.750
WERE WE DONE
BACK THERE
AT THE PARK?

20:33.750 --> 20:35.291
TOTALLY DONE.

20:35.291 --> 20:37.333
ALL RIGHT.
SO, YOU'RE OK?

20:37.333 --> 20:40.750
I AM SO  OK.
ACTUALLY, I FEEL
REALLY GREAT.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.125
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME BACK THE X?

20:42.125 --> 20:43.750
JACK WON'T SEE.

20:43.750 --> 20:45.458
UM, JEN?

20:45.458 --> 20:47.125
DON'T BE MAD,
BUT I SORT OF
TOOK ONE.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.542
ANDIE, NO. W-WHEN?

20:49.542 --> 20:50.875
WELL, BEFORE WE
GOT BACK TO THE CAR,

20:50.875 --> 20:53.708
I JUST DECIDED--
YOU KNOW,
CARPE DIEM.

20:53.708 --> 20:54.875
ANDIE, NO, THIS IS
SO NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

20:54.875 --> 20:57.166
BUT YOU SAID
IT WAS AMAZING
THE FIRST FEW TIMES.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.166
AND I THINK
I'VE EARNED

20:59.166 --> 21:01.625
AN AMAZING NIGHT,
RIGHT?

21:01.625 --> 21:02.667
I'LL PAY YOU BACK.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.208
I MEAN,
WHATEVER IT COST.
IS IT A LOT?

21:04.208 --> 21:05.583
NO, ANDIE,
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE MONEY.

21:05.583 --> 21:06.750
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.250
THAT'S SO SWEET,
JEN.

21:08.250 --> 21:12.750
BUT I TOLD YOU,
I'M FEELING FINE.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.959
UM, LOOK, CAN WE
NOT TELL JACK
ABOUT THIS?

21:15.959 --> 21:16.667
BECAUSE
I DON'T THINK
HE'D APPROVE.

21:16.667 --> 21:19.375
YEAH.

21:19.375 --> 21:20.750
OK, COME ON.

21:25.125 --> 21:28.041
Drue: HA HA!
RIGHT ON!

21:28.041 --> 21:31.333
YOU GUYS ARE
SO NOT THE SQUARES
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.917
HI THERE.
WE HAVEN'T MET.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.333
I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.834
HO HO HO!
OOH! OUCH!

21:38.959 --> 21:41.625
IS IT WEIRD THAT WE'RE ALL HERE,
OR WHAT?

21:41.625 --> 21:43.041
SOMEBODY'S OUT
CELEBRATING.

21:43.041 --> 21:45.166
YEP!

21:45.166 --> 21:45.917
Gretchen: WHAT ARE
WE CELEBRATING?

21:45.917 --> 21:48.291
ANDIE GOT
INTO HARVARD.

YOUR SUDDEN,
DESPERATE NEED

21:51.458 --> 21:53.000
TO FOCUS
ON YOUR FUTURE.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.917
I REALLY DON'T
NEED YOU TONIGHT.

21:54.917 --> 21:56.333
YOU DID IT,

21:56.333 --> 21:58.792
JUST LIKE
YOU ALWAYS SAID
YOU WOULD.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.792
WOW, POTTER.
HOW COOL ARE YOU?

22:00.792 --> 22:01.583
YOU DON'T MIND
THAT LASTED

22:01.583 --> 22:03.208
JUST A SPLIT SECOND
LONGER

22:03.208 --> 22:06.792
THEN THE EX-GUIDELINES
ALLOW?

22:08.250 --> 22:11.959
WHO IS THAT GUY?

22:11.959 --> 22:14.792
DID YOU EVER MEET
ABBY MORGAN?

22:17.917 --> 22:19.250
WOW, JEN!

22:19.250 --> 22:22.625

IS SO BEAUTIFUL!

[TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING]

22:32.875 --> 22:36.458
WOW.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.250
WHOO!

22:46.166 --> 22:49.125
OK, UM, ANDIE,
PETTING JOEY?

22:49.125 --> 22:50.792
NOT A GOOD WAY
TO MAINTAIN
A LOW PROFILE.

22:50.792 --> 22:52.041
I WANT YOU
TO ENJOY THIS,

22:52.041 --> 22:52.834
BUT YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO TRY
AND MAINTAIN,

22:52.834 --> 22:54.375
ESPECIALLY
AROUND THE PEOPLE

22:54.375 --> 22:55.625
THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE
COME MONDAY MORNING.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.708
I'M OK, JEN, REALLY!

22:57.708 --> 23:00.250
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'M FEELING FINE.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.041
I'M SURE YOU ARE.
LISTEN, ANDIE,

23:02.041 --> 23:03.458
I REALLY WANNA KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU TONIGHT,

23:03.458 --> 23:04.875
SO YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WORK WITH ME

23:04.875 --> 23:06.875
AND STICK BY ME.

THE BEST, JEN!

23:09.750 --> 23:12.750
OOH! I NEVER
KNEW YOUR HAIR
WAS SO SOFT.

23:12.750 --> 23:16.208
OK, ANDIE. AGAIN,
NOT IN THE REALM
OF MAINTAINING.

23:16.208 --> 23:19.041
YOU'VE GOTTA TRY
HARDER FOR ME, PLEASE?

23:19.041 --> 23:20.750
THERE ARE WILD PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE.

23:20.750 --> 23:22.583
THIS IS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF RECKLESS
ABANDONMENT YOU NEED.

23:22.583 --> 23:25.041

IS GOING TO DANCE?

A BIG FAVOR?

TO KEEP AN EYE

23:32.166 --> 23:33.708
ON DRUE AND ANDY
FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

23:33.708 --> 23:34.750
WHY?

23:34.750 --> 23:36.417
JUST TRUST ME.
HE'S NOT
THE KIND OF GUY

23:36.417 --> 23:38.917
THAT YOU LEAVE
YOUR SISTER WITH.

23:57.041 --> 23:59.083
Gretchen: I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE DAWSON SNAFU.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.667
WHEN I INVITED HIM,
HE SAID NO.

24:00.667 --> 24:01.667
IT DIDN'T
EVEN OCCUR TO ME

24:01.667 --> 24:02.542
THAT HE WOULD
CHANGE HIS MIND.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.750
THAT'S OK. I'M--
I'M KIND OF GLAD

24:04.750 --> 24:06.166
THAT WE ALL ENDED UP
TOGETHER.

24:06.166 --> 24:08.959
I MEAN, ACCIDENTAL
OR NOT, THINGS HAVE
BEEN GETTING BETTER.

24:08.959 --> 24:11.000

I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.166
THE THREE OF YOU
HAVE SO MUCH HISTORY.

24:14.166 --> 24:15.667
AND DAWSON'S
SUCH A GREAT GUY.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.417
SPEAKING
OF DAWSON, UM,

24:19.417 --> 24:21.708
AND I KNOW THIS IS
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

24:21.708 --> 24:23.166
IS THERE POSSIBLY,

24:23.166 --> 24:25.542
EVEN IN
THE VAGUEST WAY, UM,

24:25.542 --> 24:27.041
WELL, SOMETHING
HAPPENING WITH YOU
AND DAWSON?

24:27.041 --> 24:29.500
HEH HEH! WHERE EXACTLY
DID THAT COME FROM?

24:29.500 --> 24:31.417
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
YOU'RE AWARE

24:31.417 --> 24:33.583
OF HIS INCREDIBLY
INFAMOUS CRUSH
ON YOU.

24:33.583 --> 24:36.166

24:44.291 --> 24:45.875

THIS, UM, WAY

24:45.875 --> 24:47.208

ON TO THINGS

I MEAN, SURE
HE OUTGROWS THEM,

24:49.792 --> 24:51.458
PUTS THEM
IN THEIR PROPER
PERSPECTIVE,

24:51.458 --> 24:53.083
BUT THAT
DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN
THAT THEY'RE GONE.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.750
SOMETIMES I THINK
THEY'RE JUST
WAITING AROUND

24:54.750 --> 24:57.834
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT
TO COME OUT
AGAIN AND...

24:57.834 --> 25:00.083

IF HE THINKS

25:00.083 --> 25:02.000
THERE'S
THE SLIGHTEST
CHANCE--

25:02.000 --> 25:03.083
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

FOR SOME CHILDHOOD CRUSH

DON'T IT?

25:27.917 --> 25:31.583

TO BE MAINTAINING.

EXCEPT JEN,

25:32.792 --> 25:34.875

GONNA MAKE SURE
I'M OK TONIGHT.

FOR THIS, OK?

25:38.542 --> 25:41.500

FAR BETTER GUIDE
THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS

COULD EVER BE.

OK? COME ON, IVY LEAGUE,
LET'S HAVE FUN.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.417
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE VIOLATING

BUDDY SYSTEM.

26:04.959 --> 26:06.959
NO ONE VENTURES OUT
ALONE, REMEMBER?

26:06.959 --> 26:08.708
YEAH, WELL,
I WOULD'VE
STAYED IN THERE,

26:08.708 --> 26:10.125
BUT I WAS
REALLY INTIMIDATED

26:10.125 --> 26:11.291
BY ALL THE INTRICATE
STEPS NECESSARY

26:11.291 --> 26:14.625
TO ENJOY THE MOST
TUNELESS MUSIC
KNOWN TO MAN.

26:14.625 --> 26:16.917
I, TOO, FELT
A LITTLE OUT OF PLACE,

26:16.917 --> 26:18.708
YOU KNOW,
NOT HAVING DRESSED

26:18.708 --> 26:20.166
IN WHAT COULD ONLY
BE DESCRIBED

26:20.166 --> 26:23.333
AS AN HOMAGE
TO JAPANESE ANIMATION.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.792
SO, WHY ARE WE HERE?

26:27.583 --> 26:29.625
WE'RE TRYING
SOMETHING NEW.

26:29.625 --> 26:33.250
YEAH, WHICH ONLY
REALLY SERVES

26:33.250 --> 26:35.792
TO LET ME
KNOW HOW MUCH
I ENJOYED THE OLD.

26:35.792 --> 26:39.458
HMM! ME, TOO.

26:39.458 --> 26:41.583
BUT I AM GLAD
WE CAME.

26:41.583 --> 26:43.291
I MEAN,
IF NOTHING ELSE,
TO WITNESS

26:43.291 --> 26:45.917
THE WASTED YOUTH
OF AMERICA FIRSTHAND.

26:45.917 --> 26:46.834
AND IT AIN'T PRETTY.

BUT YOU, MADAME,
MOST CERTAINLY ARE.

26:54.041 --> 26:55.583
MMM!
MMM!

26:57.083 --> 26:59.083
HEH HEH HEH!

27:01.583 --> 27:03.250
REMEMBER HOW
WE USED TO PLAY

27:03.250 --> 27:04.667
BARNACLE
FOR YOUR THOUGHTS?

27:04.667 --> 27:05.792
YES.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.834
WELL, I DON'T EXACTLY
HAVE A BARNACLE ON ME,

27:07.834 --> 27:12.250
BUT I COULD OFFER YOU
THIS LOVELY GLOW NECKLACE.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.208
OH, WHICH I WOULD
GLADLY ACCEPT.

27:14.208 --> 27:17.917
OH! GIVES YOU THAT
WHOLE CAESAR LOOK AGAIN.

27:20.834 --> 27:22.708
SO, I DID MY PART,

27:22.708 --> 27:25.000
AND I THINK NOW YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO TELL ME

27:25.000 --> 27:26.875
SOMETHING DEEP
AND PROFOUND.

27:30.291 --> 27:32.792
YOU WANNA HEAR
SOMETHING DEEP
AND PROFOUND, HUH?

27:36.750 --> 27:40.000
I MISS TRUE LOVE,
JOEY.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.875
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW,

27:41.875 --> 27:43.458
SITTING
UNDER THE STARS,

27:43.458 --> 27:46.750
MY ARM AROUND YOU,
LET ME TELL YOU...

27:46.750 --> 27:49.708
I MISS TRUE LOVE
SOMETHING FIERCE.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.000
I MISS HER, TOO,
PACEY.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.542
HMM.

28:00.333 --> 28:03.125
HEY. GLOW NECKLACE?

28:03.125 --> 28:04.667
ALL THE COOL KIDS
SEEM TO BE WEARING THEM.

28:04.667 --> 28:07.875
NO? IF YOU
DON'T LIKE THE COLOR,

28:07.875 --> 28:09.917
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO EXCHANGE IT.
THEY'VE GOT OTHERS.

28:09.917 --> 28:12.917
NO, IT'S GREAT.
THANKS.

28:12.917 --> 28:13.917
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

28:14.917 --> 28:16.792
OK. THERE'S
NO EASY WAY
TO SAY THIS,

28:16.792 --> 28:19.333
SO I'M JUST GONNA
PUT IT OUT THERE.

28:19.333 --> 28:20.625
IS IT POSSIBLE,

28:20.625 --> 28:22.000
EVEN IN
THE VAGUEST WAY,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.375
THAT YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE YOU THINK
THERE'S A CHANCE

28:24.375 --> 28:25.583
SOMETHING
MIGHT BE HAPPENING
BETWEEN US?

28:25.583 --> 28:29.667
I THINK THERE IS
SOMETHING HAPPENING
BETWEEN US.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.041
IT'S CALLED FRIENDSHIP.

28:31.041 --> 28:32.625
AND THAT'S
ALL YOU EXPECT?

28:32.625 --> 28:35.542
DID I DO SOMETHING
TO MAKE YOU THINK
I EXPECTED MORE?

28:35.542 --> 28:37.917
NO. NO, SORRY.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.166
THIS IS
SO OUT OF THE BLUE,

28:40.166 --> 28:41.667
I FEEL RIDICULOUS
THAT I EVEN
MENTIONED IT.

28:41.667 --> 28:44.708
DON'T FEEL RIDICULOUS.
IT'S NO SECRET THAT
AT ONE POINT IN MY LIFE

28:44.708 --> 28:47.708
I WOULD HAVE KILLED
FOR YOU TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT I WAS IN A ROOM,

28:47.708 --> 28:49.625
LET ALONE HANG OUT
WITH YOU. BUT, UH...

28:49.625 --> 28:53.959
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
WHERE EITHER ONE OF US
ARE AT RIGHT NOW.

28:53.959 --> 28:55.250
SO WHERE ARE WE AT?

28:55.250 --> 28:57.625
UM...

28:58.208 --> 28:59.792
WELL...

28:59.792 --> 29:03.542
WHEN THAT BOAT SAILED
LAST SUMMER,

29:03.542 --> 29:05.708
I DIDN'T JUST LOSE JOEY.
I LOST MY 2 BEST FRIENDS.

29:05.708 --> 29:09.667
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU MOVE ON, AND...

29:09.667 --> 29:11.542
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOU MAKE NEW FRIENDS
LIKE YOU.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.041
YOU'RE EASY TO TALK TO.
YOU GIVE REALLY GOOD ADVICE.

29:14.041 --> 29:17.583
BUT, UH...
I DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING,

29:17.583 --> 29:19.583
YOU KNOW? IT'S JUST
THE OPPOSITE, REALLY.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.792
IT'S JUST...
GOD, IT'S REALLY NICE

29:21.792 --> 29:24.083
TO JUST BE IN THE PRESENT
WITH SOMEBODY.

29:24.083 --> 29:24.917
OK.
OK?

29:27.792 --> 29:29.333
DANCE OR BOUNCE?

29:31.125 --> 29:32.083
BOUNCE?

29:32.083 --> 29:33.041
[LAUGHING]

29:34.834 --> 29:36.250
OH, MY GOD! HI!

29:36.250 --> 29:38.125
IT'S YOU GUYS!
I LOVE YOU GUYS!

29:38.125 --> 29:40.750
MMM!

29:40.750 --> 29:42.083
[CHUCKLING]

29:42.083 --> 29:43.542
SHE'S FEELING
THE LOVE.

29:43.542 --> 29:45.166
APPARENTLY.

29:45.166 --> 29:46.458
[GIGGLING]

29:46.458 --> 29:49.667
YEAH, ANDIE, I THINK
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH
HUGGING TONIGHT.

29:49.667 --> 29:52.458
I JUST WANTED
TO SHOW YOU GUYS
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU BOTH.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.458
YOU GUYS ARE
SO GOOD TOGETHER!

29:54.458 --> 29:56.375
AND, JOEY,
YOU ARE SO NICE!

29:56.375 --> 29:59.208
WELL, EXCEPT FOR THE TIME
WHEN YOU DUMPED DAWSON
FOR PACEY.

29:59.208 --> 30:01.917
THAT WAS PRETTY COLD.
BUT, REALLY,
WHO CAN BLAME YOU?

30:01.917 --> 30:03.500
I MEAN, IT'S PACEY.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.125
[GIGGLES]

30:05.125 --> 30:07.041
I PRETEND NOT TO CARE,

30:07.041 --> 30:08.792
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, PACE,

30:08.792 --> 30:10.750
YOU ARE THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE,

30:10.750 --> 30:14.625
AND I AM
SO NOT OVER YOU!

30:14.625 --> 30:15.959
I HOPE IT'S OK
THAT I SAID THAT.

30:15.959 --> 30:17.625
I MEAN, WE'RE ALL
REALLY GOOD FRIENDS,
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE

30:17.625 --> 30:19.834
THAT BIG
OF A SECRET, RIGHT?

30:19.834 --> 30:22.041
IT'S NEWS TO ME, ANDIE.

30:22.041 --> 30:24.291
YOU TOTALLY
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
PACEY IS SO OVER ME

30:24.291 --> 30:26.792
AND SUCH
THE FAITHFUL TYPE.

30:26.792 --> 30:30.250
IF ONLY I HAD BEEN--
MAYBE WE'D STILL
BE TOGETHER.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.375
ANDIE, ARE YOU
FEELING OK?

30:31.375 --> 30:34.083
OH, YEAH.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.792
[LAUGHS]
I FEEL GREAT.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.667
AND I JUST
GOT INTO HARVARD!

30:38.667 --> 30:41.458
OH! WE'RE
GONNA GO BOUNCE.

30:41.458 --> 30:43.500
COME WITH US!
COME ON!

30:43.500 --> 30:45.125
NO. YOU GUYS
GO AHEAD.

30:45.125 --> 30:46.500
OK! OK.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.959
LET'S GO! [GIGGLES]

30:59.667 --> 31:00.625
JACK.

31:00.625 --> 31:01.834
JACK!

31:01.834 --> 31:03.083
JACK!
WHAT, WHAT?
HEY.

31:03.083 --> 31:04.208
HEY, WHERE'D
EVERYBODY GO?

31:04.208 --> 31:06.291
JEN, I WANT YOU
TO MEET HOLLY
AND LIZ.

31:06.291 --> 31:08.792
RIGHT. HI.
LISTEN, CAN YOU

31:08.792 --> 31:11.250
JUST POINT ME
TO WHERE ANDIE WENT,
GENERAL DIRECTION?

31:11.250 --> 31:12.500
I DON'T KNOW.
I LOST TRACK OF HER

31:12.500 --> 31:13.667
WHEN I STARTED
HANGING OUT
WITH THESE GUYS.

31:13.667 --> 31:16.041
I ASKED YOU TO DO ONE THING--
ONE LITTLE THING.

31:16.041 --> 31:19.166
I DON'T KNOW.
COME ON, WE'RE
GONNA GO FIND HER.

31:19.166 --> 31:21.208
I--[GRUMBLES]
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

31:21.208 --> 31:23.542
HEY, WHAT, UH,
WHAT IS WITH YOU?

31:23.542 --> 31:25.708
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LIKE
THIS MAJOR RAVER.

31:25.708 --> 31:28.208
ALL YOU
SEEM TO BE DOING
IS MONITORING ANDIE.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.708
I'M JUST MAKING SURE
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

31:29.708 --> 31:32.125
WHY WOULDN'T
SHE BE?

31:32.125 --> 31:34.375
LET'S JUST FIND HER.

31:34.375 --> 31:35.166
HA HA HA. WHOA!

31:39.041 --> 31:39.208
WHOA!

31:50.250 --> 31:54.041
HEY, THIS IS
A NO-PARKING ZONE,
BUDDY. MOVE IT.

31:54.041 --> 31:55.708
HERE.

31:55.708 --> 31:56.792
HEY, YOU GUYS,
CAN WE COME BOUNCE?

31:56.792 --> 31:59.333
YEAH.
PLENTY OF ROOM.

31:59.333 --> 32:00.583
THANKS!

32:02.625 --> 32:04.375
Andie:
WHOO HOO HOO!

32:06.208 --> 32:07.417
HI THERE.

32:07.417 --> 32:10.250
WOW, THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!
IT'S LIKE A BIG GANG BOUNCE!

32:10.250 --> 32:13.583
I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN
WITH DRUE AND YOU AND DAWSON!

32:21.875 --> 32:23.291
YOU OK?

32:24.959 --> 32:26.708
YOU DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD, ANDIE.

32:26.708 --> 32:27.917
I'M GETTING A LITTLE BIT
OF A HEADACHE.

32:27.917 --> 32:30.542
LET'S SIT
THIS ONE OUT.

32:30.542 --> 32:31.667
DRUE?

32:31.667 --> 32:34.041
REST FOR A MINUTE.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

32:38.834 --> 32:42.208
DAWSON, I'M
NOT FEELING SO--

32:42.208 --> 32:45.625
ANDIE? YOU ALL RIGHT?
ANDIE? GOD.

32:45.625 --> 32:46.708
ANDIE--ANDIE!

32:46.708 --> 32:49.083
DAWSON,
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:49.083 --> 32:52.125
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE JUST COLLAPSED.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.792
ANDIE, COME ON!
WAKE UP! PLEASE
DON'T DO THIS!

32:53.792 --> 32:56.875
COME ON! PLEASE DON'T
DO THIS, ANDIE!

32:56.875 --> 32:58.834
SOMEBODY HELP US!

32:58.834 --> 33:01.291
ANDIE! COME ON!

33:01.291 --> 33:03.583
COME ON, WAKE UP.
WAKE UP.

33:06.375 --> 33:09.792
WE NEED
SOME HELP HERE.

33:09.792 --> 33:11.250
IT'S MY SISTER.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.166
WE WERE IN THE MOON BOUNCE,
AND SHE JUST COLLAPSED.

33:13.166 --> 33:14.250
WHAT'S SHE ON?

33:14.250 --> 33:16.125
UH, AN ANTIDEPRESSANT,
NARDIL, I THINK.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.500
NO. WHAT
IS SHE ON?

33:17.500 --> 33:18.750
X. SHE TOOK
A TAB OF ECSTASY.

33:18.750 --> 33:19.750
WITH NARDIL?
HOW BAD IS IT?

33:19.750 --> 33:22.542
TEMP'S 103.
BP 190 OVER 110.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.875
WE GOTTA GET HER
TO THE HOSPITAL
LIKE 10 MINUTES AGO.

33:24.875 --> 33:26.417
ON MY COUNT. 1,

33:26.417 --> 33:27.166
2, 3.

33:35.041 --> 33:37.542
IF ANYONE'S
GONNA RIDE, GET IN.

33:37.542 --> 33:38.208
YEAH, THAT'S ME.

33:38.208 --> 33:39.000
JACK--
NOT NOW, JEN.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.917
PLEASE LET ME
COME WITH YOU.

33:40.917 --> 33:42.500
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
ENOUGH FOR TONIGHT.

33:42.500 --> 33:43.625
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.500
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
ON HER MEDICATION. I--

33:45.500 --> 33:48.083
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
YOU GAVE MY SISTER
DRUGS, JEN!

33:48.083 --> 33:50.166
SHOULD BE YOU
IN THIS AMBULANCE.

34:04.583 --> 34:06.041
DO YOU, UH...

34:06.041 --> 34:08.417
YOU NEED A RIDE
TO THE HOSPITAL?

34:12.417 --> 34:14.583
NO. NO, I SHOULD
PROBABLY JUST GO HOME.

34:14.583 --> 34:16.875
OK.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.792
LET'S GO, GUYS.

34:32.375 --> 34:33.625
HOW IS SHE?

34:33.625 --> 34:35.958
NOT GOOD.

34:37.625 --> 34:39.542
REALLY NOT GOOD.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.458
COME ON.
I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.917
AT THE PARK,
ALL THE WARNING SIGNS
WERE THERE.

34:48.917 --> 34:50.958
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I DIDN'T SEE IT.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.958
SHE TOOK THE STUFF.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.083
DRUE, I PRACTICALLY
STAMPED A-M-A APPROVED ON IT.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.083
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.333
I MEAN,
FORGET HER MEDICATION,

34:57.333 --> 34:59.417
SHE COULD HAVE GONE DOWN
FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS,

34:59.417 --> 35:00.750
AND IT STILL WOULD
HAVE BEEN MY FAULT.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.417
ANDIE IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER OWN CHOICES,
EVEN HER BAD ONES.

35:03.417 --> 35:05.583
WHY ARE YOU
SO INTERESTED IN
PLAYING THE MARTYR HERE?

35:05.583 --> 35:07.208
DOES NOTHING FAZE YOU?
ANDIE'S MY FRIEND,

35:07.208 --> 35:10.708
AND SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF
SOMETHING SHE GOT FROM ME,

35:10.708 --> 35:12.500
AND YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I SHOULD FEEL BAD?

35:12.500 --> 35:14.375
YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO FEEL BAD ABOUT?

35:14.375 --> 35:17.625
HOW ABOUT THE WAY YOUR
"FRIENDS" ICED YOU?

35:17.625 --> 35:19.000
I HATE...

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I HATE THE WAY
YOU TWIST EVERYTHING.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.375
HATE IT ALL YOU WANT.
THE TRUTH STILL IS,

35:22.375 --> 35:25.583
NO MATTER WHAT
ANDIE TELLS THEM,
MONDAY AT SCHOOL

35:25.583 --> 35:27.542
THEY'RE GONNA TREAT YOU
LIKE THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.375
YOU CAME HERE
THE BANISHED
BAD SEED, JEN.

35:29.375 --> 35:31.291
THAT'S ALL
YOU'LL EVER BE TO THEM.

35:31.291 --> 35:33.291
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY WANT YOU
TO PLAY THAT ROLE

35:33.291 --> 35:35.625
SO THAT THEY
CAN FEEL BETTER ABOUT
THE PATHETIC, PLASTIC,

35:35.625 --> 35:37.417
MAYBERRY EXISTENCE
THEY'RE LIVING.

35:37.417 --> 35:39.542
AND I THOUGHT
THAT I WAS DAMAGED.

35:39.542 --> 35:42.750
YOU ARE. SO AM I.
AND THAT'S WHY
WE NEED EACH OTHER.

35:42.750 --> 35:44.959
WE'RE COMING FROM
THE SAME PLACE
HERE, JEN.

35:44.959 --> 35:47.417
NO, DRUE.
WE CAME FROM
THE SAME PLACE,

35:47.417 --> 35:49.375
BUT NOW
WE'RE MILES APART,

35:49.375 --> 35:51.291
AND I INTEND
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.708
I'M GONNA CALL MY FRIEND
AND SEE HOW SHE'S DOING.

36:00.083 --> 36:01.000
YOU GET HIM?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.125
TAKEN CARE OF.
THANKS.

36:03.125 --> 36:04.250
HOW'S ANDIE?

36:04.250 --> 36:06.458
UH...SHE'S, UH,

36:06.458 --> 36:08.250
SHE'S STABLE NOW.

36:08.250 --> 36:11.458
THEY SAID THAT SHE
WENT INTO SOME KIND
OF HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS.

36:11.458 --> 36:13.583
SEE, ANDIE'S
ON THIS OLDER TYPE

36:13.583 --> 36:15.083
OF ANTIDEPRESSANT,

36:15.083 --> 36:17.500
AND IT TURNS OUT
IT'S, YOU KNOW,

36:17.500 --> 36:21.125
IT'S A TIME BOMB
WHEN IT'S MIXED
WITH THE WRONG THING.

36:21.125 --> 36:21.917
SO, UH...

36:21.917 --> 36:24.417
IN A WAY I GUESS, UH,

36:24.417 --> 36:26.667
WE'RE PRETTY LUCKY
THE WAY THINGS TURNED OUT,

36:26.667 --> 36:28.792
THAT SHE DIDN'T, UM...

36:30.166 --> 36:32.208
GOD, SHE COULD
HAVE DIED.

36:38.750 --> 36:42.000
THEY WANT TO, UM,
THEY WANT TO KEEP
HER OVERNIGHT,

36:42.000 --> 36:43.125
SO...I KNOW SHE
APPRECIATES YOU GUYS

36:43.125 --> 36:46.500
BEING HERE AND
EVERYTHING, BUT...

36:46.500 --> 36:49.041
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S IN THE MOOD
FOR VISITORS RIGHT NOW.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.000
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST GO HOME, GIVE HER
A CALL TOMORROW,

36:51.000 --> 36:52.083
SEE HOW SHE'S FEELING.

36:52.083 --> 36:54.291
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SURE SHE NEEDS
HER REST.

36:54.291 --> 36:56.125
I THINK WE DO, TOO.

36:57.750 --> 37:01.083
YEAH. SO...I'LL SEE
YOU GUYS TOMORROW.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.000
ARE YOU OK, PACE?

37:09.333 --> 37:09.500
NO.

37:11.792 --> 37:14.750
NO. I SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN THAT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

37:14.750 --> 37:15.667
I MEAN, I KNEW.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.166
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
HOW BAD IT WAS.

37:18.166 --> 37:19.917
EVEN IF YOU
HAD REALIZED,

37:19.917 --> 37:21.750
THERE'S
NOTHING YOU
COULD HAVE DONE.

37:21.750 --> 37:23.875
YEAH.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.875
I THINK I WANT
TO STAY HERE
TONIGHT...

37:25.875 --> 37:28.834
IF THAT'S OK.

37:28.834 --> 37:30.000
COMPLETELY.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.375
YOU WANT COMPANY?

37:34.708 --> 37:38.041
NO, I'LL JUST
GIVE YOU A CALL
WHEN I GET HOME, OK?

37:42.250 --> 37:42.417
HERE.

37:43.458 --> 37:46.458
IN CASE YOU NEED
SOMETHING TO REST ON.

38:07.458 --> 38:10.875
NOT EXACTLY THE EVENING
I HAD IN MIND
WHEN I INVITED YOU.

38:10.875 --> 38:13.458
WELL, I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY HAD THIS EVENING
IN MIND.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.667
BUT, UH...

38:15.667 --> 38:17.959
I'M GLAD I WENT.

38:17.959 --> 38:19.625
ME, TOO.

38:19.625 --> 38:21.458
SO, UH...

38:21.458 --> 38:22.458
GOOD NIGHT.

38:22.458 --> 38:23.959
SEE YOU AT WORK.

38:23.959 --> 38:25.291
ALL RIGHT.

38:25.875 --> 38:26.875
DAWSON.

38:26.875 --> 38:30.291
YEAH?

38:30.291 --> 38:31.959
YOUR FRIENDSHIP MEANS
A LOT TO ME, TOO.

38:31.959 --> 38:33.834
COMING BACK HERE
HAS BEEN REALLY HARD,

38:33.834 --> 38:36.792
AND SOMEHOW YOU'VE
MADE THE TRANSITION
A LOT MORE ENJOYABLE

38:36.792 --> 38:39.667
THAN I EVER THOUGHT
IT COULD BE.

38:39.667 --> 38:42.125
GOOD. THAT'S
WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

38:43.792 --> 38:44.250
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

38:44.250 --> 38:46.166
GOOD NIGHT.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.959
WEIRD NIGHT, HUH?

39:01.708 --> 39:03.417
YEAH.

39:03.417 --> 39:05.625
I'M NOT EVEN TIRED.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.375
HOW 'BOUT
HUNGRY?

39:16.834 --> 39:18.333
I'M SORRY, DADDY.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.667
I REALLY AM.

39:20.667 --> 39:21.875
I'M NOT MAD, ANDIE.

39:21.875 --> 39:24.458
I AM.

39:25.708 --> 39:29.375
THE--THE THREE
OF US, WE, UM...
WE NEED EACH OTHER.

39:29.375 --> 39:32.000
YOU CAN'T DO STUPID
THINGS LIKE THIS, ANDIE.
YOU JUST CAN'T.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.458
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT
WHAT OUR FAMILY'S
BEEN THROUGH ALREADY.

39:35.458 --> 39:36.875
I KNOW.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.041
I'M SORRY.
I KNOW IT WAS STUPID.

39:39.041 --> 39:41.458
IT'S THE STUPIDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

39:41.458 --> 39:45.000
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST...

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I WANTED TO FEEL
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.333
ANYTHING.

39:49.333 --> 39:50.542
IT'S OK.

39:50.542 --> 39:52.125
WE'LL GET
THROUGH THIS

39:52.125 --> 39:54.125
AS LONG AS WE
CAN COMMUNICATE,

39:54.125 --> 39:57.166
YOU KNOW, AS...
A FAMILY.

39:57.166 --> 40:00.208
YOU HAVE TO TELL
US WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.834
NO MORE SECRETS.

40:03.834 --> 40:05.000
OK.

40:07.875 --> 40:09.291
HEY.

40:09.291 --> 40:12.333
IT'S A...25-CENT COFFEE
FROM THE MACHINE,

40:12.333 --> 40:14.417
SO DON'T GET
YOUR HOPES UP.

40:14.417 --> 40:16.333
THANK YOU.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.375
YOU STAYED.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.417
WELL, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO,

40:20.417 --> 40:23.083
SO I FIGURED I'D
JUST STAY AND BUG YOU.

40:23.083 --> 40:25.125
YOU'RE NOT BUGGING ME.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.417
ABOUT THE THINGS
THAT I SAID, PACEY...

40:28.417 --> 40:31.041
HEY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

40:31.041 --> 40:33.750
DOESN'T MATTER.
WHAT MATTERS NOW
IS THAT YOU'RE OK.

40:36.041 --> 40:36.667
THANKS.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.583
I CAN'T SHAKE THE WAY
THAT ANDIE LOOKED

40:51.583 --> 40:54.542
WHEN THEY PUT HER
IN THAT AMBULANCE.

40:54.542 --> 40:57.166
IT'S SCARY HOW THINGS
CAN TURN SO BAD SO FAST.

40:57.166 --> 40:59.417
IT'S SCARY HOW REAL
EVERYTHING'S BEEN
THIS YEAR, YOU KNOW?

40:59.417 --> 41:02.875
JEN AND PACEY
IN THE STORM,

41:02.875 --> 41:05.542
AND ANDIE TONIGHT...

41:05.542 --> 41:08.542
DOES MAKE YOU
KINDA REALIZE
THAT ANY ONE OF US

41:08.542 --> 41:10.667
COULD GO AT ANY MOMENT
FOR THE STUPIDEST
OF REASONS.

41:12.667 --> 41:13.708
YEAH.

41:14.708 --> 41:17.125
I REMEMBER WHEN
PARTIES USED TO BE

41:17.125 --> 41:19.708
BOWLING AND BIRTHDAY
CAKES, YOU KNOW?

41:19.708 --> 41:23.834
NOW THEY'RE HIGH-RISK
ADVENTURES THAT CAN
ACTUALLY KILL YOU.

41:25.583 --> 41:27.792
ANOTHER PERK OF GROWING UP
IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM.

41:34.375 --> 41:36.625
YOU KNOW,
LESS THAN A YEAR,
DAWSON,

41:36.625 --> 41:37.959
AND WE'LL ALL
BE OUTTA HERE.

41:37.959 --> 41:39.834
YEAH.

41:39.834 --> 41:43.667
IT'S REALLY SAD
TO THINK THAT
AFTER 18 YEARS

41:43.667 --> 41:46.375
OF LIVING DOWN
THE CREEK
FROM EACH OTHER,

41:46.375 --> 41:48.959
THERE'S GONNA
BE NO ONE ROWING
OUR BOATS ANYMORE.

41:48.959 --> 41:51.959
WELL, I WOULDN'T PUT
OUR BOATS IN DRY-DOCK
JUST YET.

41:51.959 --> 41:53.834
YOU HAVE PLANS
FOR OUR BOATS?

41:53.834 --> 41:57.667
I DO. I THINK YOU SHOULD
GIVE YOURS TO ALEXANDER,

41:57.667 --> 42:00.500
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
BE GIVING MINE TO MY
NEW BROTHER OR SISTER.

42:00.500 --> 42:02.375
THAT'S WHY GALE'S
BEEN SO SICK LATELY?

42:02.375 --> 42:04.667
SHE'S PREGNANT?
MM-HMM.

42:06.166 --> 42:07.708
CONGRATULATIONS!
OH, MY GOD!

42:11.250 --> 42:12.708
WELL, YOU KNOW,
CAPESIDE WOULDN'T
BE CAPESIDE

42:12.708 --> 42:15.583
WITHOUT A LITTLE
LEERY RUNNING AROUND.

42:15.583 --> 42:18.750
OR ROWING
ACROSS THE CREEK
TO GET TO YOUR HOUSE.

42:19.625 --> 42:22.083
SOUNDS WEIRD,
BUT HEARING THAT,

42:22.083 --> 42:23.917
MAKES ME FEEL--

42:23.917 --> 42:26.041
OLD?

42:27.208 --> 42:28.792
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

42:28.792 --> 42:30.208
IT'S THE WAY I FELT.

42:30.208 --> 42:32.708
NOTHING--HA--PROPELS YOU
INTO ADULTHOOD FASTER

42:32.708 --> 42:36.667
THAN THE NEXT GENERATION
NIPPING AT YOUR HEELS.

42:42.542 --> 42:45.375
YOU KNOW,
DAWSON, UM...

42:45.375 --> 42:48.542
I THINK ABOUT IT
SOMETIMES,

42:48.542 --> 42:50.208
AND...

42:50.208 --> 42:53.542
WHEREVER WE GO NEXT,

42:53.542 --> 42:56.417
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE
LIFE WITHOUT YOU.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.708
YOU DID PRETTY WELL
FOR 3 MONTHS.

43:06.458 --> 43:09.000
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

43:12.708 --> 43:13.750
YEAH.

43:17.250 --> 43:19.125
YEAH, I DO.

43:22.750 --> 43:24.166
[SIGHS]
