A SECURITY DEPOSIT,

FIRST AND LAST MONTHS' RENT,
KEY FEE,

02:44.898 --> 02:47.568

03:00.614 --> 03:04.685
SO I WON'T BE NEEDING THESE.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.487
- HAVE A PALMWOODS TIME.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.500
- HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN FIGHTING
AGAIN?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.236
- IT WAS A MILD SKIRMISH.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.306
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU GUYS
TO GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.808

WE'RE FIGHTING SO MUCH.

- IT'S STARTING.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.527
- WHAT'S STARTING?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.429
- YOU'RE GROWING APART
AND THIS FRIENDSHIP

03:48.462 --> 03:49.797
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST
TO BE DESTROYED

03:49.830 --> 03:51.532
BY THE INTENSE PRESSURES
OF HOLLYWOOD.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.766
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:52.800 --> 03:53.934
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TO US.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.736
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.838
BECAUSE I HAVE A PLAN.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.440
- YOU'RE GONNA GET GUSTAVO
TO YELL AT THEM

03:59.473 --> 04:00.508
AND MAKE THEM MOVE BACK?

04:00.541 --> 04:02.343
- AND NOW IF HAVE A BETTER PLAN.

THANKS, KATIE.

GERMANY WON'T CALL US BACK,

04:16.990 --> 04:18.926
AND AUSTRALIA WON'T ANSWER
ANY OF OUR EMAIL.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.761
- AHHH.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.930
- GUSTAVO,
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.031
- I KNOW.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.566
WE'RE BOOKING OUR WORLD TOUR,

04:25.599 --> 04:28.336
AND THE WORLD
WON'T CALL US BACK.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.371
- ACTUALLY, NO.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.672
ME AND THE GUYS
GOT IN A HUGE FIGHT,

04:31.705 --> 04:32.673
AND THEY MOVED OUT.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.875
[together]
THEY MOVED OUT?

04:34.908 --> 04:37.445
- YEAH, SO CAN YOU YELL AT THEM
AND GET THEM TO COME BACK

04:37.478 --> 04:38.946
SO WE CAN BE FRIENDS AGAIN?

04:38.979 --> 04:42.850
- YES, BECAUSE I DO NOT NEED
THIS BAND BREAKING UP

04:42.883 --> 04:44.485
BEFORE OUR
SOON-TO-BE WORLD TOUR.

04:44.518 --> 04:48.322
PLUS,
I LOVE TO YELL.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.025
- CAN YOU PLEASE NOT SPIKE
A BANANA PEEL?

04:52.059 --> 04:54.495
AND PICK THAT UP BEFORE YOU SLIP
ON IT AND THROW YOUR BACK OUT.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.964
- OH, PLEASE.
THAT ONLY HAPPENS IN CARTOONS.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.065
[back cracking]

04:58.098 --> 05:00.033
- [gasps]
- MY BACK.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.769
- OH, THIS LOOKS BAD.
- YEAH.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.538
- I CAN'T MOVE...OR YELL.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.073
- MAYBE IT'S NOT SO BAD.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.976
- OH, YES, IT IS, BECAUSE HE
NEEDS TO GET TO THE PALMWOODS

05:09.009 --> 05:10.544
SO HE CAN FIX US.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.746
- [whispering] KENDALL,
YOU HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.383
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THIS BAND TOGETHER.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.051
AND, KELLY, CALL DOC HOLLYWOOD.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.388
- YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM
WHISPER BEFORE.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.989
- [whispering]
I WILL DESTROY ALL OF YOU.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.692
- OH, OKAY.
OKAY, OKAY.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.097
- KENDALL,
SO NOT NICE TO SEE YOU.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.633
NOW, GET OFF MY LAWN, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.935
- THERE IS NO LAWN.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.037
AND WHAT IS THIS?

05:37.070 --> 05:40.874
- AHH, I ALWAYS WANTED A PLACE
BY THE WATER.

05:40.908 --> 05:44.878
IT'S SO PEACEFUL AND DOESN'T
HAVE ANY OF MY...EX-FRIENDS.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.514
- LOOK, WILL YOU JUST COME BACK
TO THE CRIB,

05:46.547 --> 05:48.081
AND WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT?

05:48.115 --> 05:50.017
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LIVE
IN A CABANA YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.853
- NO, BUT...

05:52.886 --> 05:54.922
THE CABANA SIGN-IN SHEET
GOES UP TO TWO YEARS,

05:54.955 --> 05:56.724
AND LOOK AT WHO'S BOOKED IT.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.526
- HUH?
- ME.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.728
- OHHH.
- NOW, GET OFF MY LAWN, HMM?

06:00.761 --> 06:02.029
- THERE IS NO LAWN,

06:02.062 --> 06:05.132
AND I'M SORRY
THAT WE WERE FIGHTING.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.868
BUT WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET YOU
TO COME BACK TO THE CRIB?

06:10.170 --> 06:12.606
- I WANT CARLOS AND JAMES
TO APOLOGIZE TOO.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.942
THEN--HMM--I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

06:14.975 --> 06:19.513
- DONE.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.114
HEY, DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHERE THEY ARE?

06:21.148 --> 06:23.851
- I DON'T CARE, BUT CARLOS DID
SAY HE ALWAYS WANTED A PLACE

06:23.884 --> 06:25.018
OVERLOOKING THE PARK.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.066
- WHO IS IT?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.434
- IT'S KENDALL.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.135
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

and shutting]

06:47.074 --> 06:50.478
[footsteps tapping]

06:50.511 --> 06:51.945
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

06:51.979 --> 06:54.214
- HMM, I WANT YOU TO MOVE BACK
INTO THE CRIB

06:54.247 --> 06:56.917
AND TO NOT LIVE IN A BOX.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.886
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:58.919 --> 07:01.622
THIS BOX HOUSE IS AWESOME.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.625
I'VE GOT A LOVELY VIEW
OF THE PARK,

07:04.658 --> 07:07.127
MY OWN BATHROOM,
AND A MODERN KITCHEN.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.095
[timer dings]

07:08.128 --> 07:12.566
OOH, ONE SECOND.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.001

07:14.034 --> 07:15.569
[sniffs]

07:15.603 --> 07:16.970
- OKAY,
SO YOUR BOX HOUSE IS COOL,

07:17.004 --> 07:19.607
BUT SO IS THE CRIB
WITH A SWIRLY SLIDE

07:19.640 --> 07:21.975
AND VIDEO GAMES
AND BEST FRIENDS,

07:22.009 --> 07:24.545
AND IF YOU JUST APOLOGIZE
TO LOGAN,

07:24.578 --> 07:26.514
WE CAN ALL BE BEST FRIENDS
AGAIN.

07:26.547 --> 07:30.083
- NO, NOT UNTIL JAMES
APOLOGIZES TO ME

07:30.117 --> 07:33.153
FOR TOSSING MY HELMET CEREAL

07:33.186 --> 07:35.155
- YEAH, WELL, THAT'S A PROBLEM,
BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS

07:35.188 --> 07:37.625
WHERE JAMES...IS.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.081
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:01.114 --> 08:04.918
- RETIRING.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.655
RETIRING FROM THE CRIB,
THE FIGHTS,

08:07.688 --> 08:10.257
AND MY FORMER FRIENDS.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.992
- WHOSE PLACE IS THIS?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.093
- DOES IT MATTER?

08:13.126 --> 08:14.828
- IT MIGHT.

08:14.862 --> 08:15.696
- HERE'S WHAT MATTERS.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.297
MOVING OUT OF THE CRIB
AND INTO HERE

08:17.330 --> 08:18.966
WAS MY BEST MOVE EVER.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.234
I CLAP,
AND THINGS HAPPEN.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.970
[claps]

08:23.003 --> 08:27.074
[light jazzy music]

08:27.107 --> 08:30.177
AND I DON'T NEED TO SHARE
MY HARD CANDIES WITH ANYONE.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.815
- AND YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS HERE.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.516
- WRONG AGAIN.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.787
OOH.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.822
- SENIOR ALERT.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.156
- OH, YEAH.
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.992
THANK YOU.
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

08:45.025 --> 08:49.162
- OH, UH, I'M GOOD.
THANKS.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.864
- OKAY.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.066
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE'RE FIGHTING SO MUCH,

08:53.100 --> 08:54.902
BUT WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS
FOREVER,

08:54.935 --> 08:58.005
AND WE HAVE A MAYBE WORLD TOUR
COMING UP,

08:58.038 --> 09:00.674
SO WOULD YOU PLEASE APOLOGIZE
TO CARLOS

09:00.708 --> 09:02.576
SO THAT WE CAN APOLOGIZE
TO LOGAN,

09:02.610 --> 09:05.045
AND DON'T SAY YOU'LL ONLY DO IT
IF LOGAN APOLOGIZES

09:05.078 --> 09:08.682
TO YOU FIRST.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.852
I SAID NOT TO SAY THAT.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.621
ARRGH.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.255
- WHY AM I ON THIS TABLE?

09:15.288 --> 09:18.058
- DOC HOLLYWOOD SAID YOU HAVE TO
LIE FLAT ON A HARD SURFACE.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.760
- WHERE IS DOC HOLLYWOOD?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.729
- SHOOTING HIS REALITY SERIES,

09:21.762 --> 09:24.231
BUT HE SAID HE'S SENDING OVER
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.900
- AND THAT WOULD BE ME,

09:26.934 --> 09:29.737
CHANTAL, ALTERNATIVE HEALER
AND SPIRITUAL ADVISOR

09:29.770 --> 09:31.204
TO THE STARS.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.372
- NO, NO, NO.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.341
NO ROBE-Y QUACKS.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.210
- THAT'S WHAT JOHNNY DEPP SAID
UNTIL I CURED HIS HALITOSIS...

09:37.244 --> 09:38.612
WITH MY PALMS.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.113
- CURE ME.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.016
I HAVE TO GET UP AND GET OUR
ALMOST WORLD TOUR GOING.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.885
AUGH.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.987
- 70% OF ALL AILMENTS
ARE IN THE MIND,

09:47.020 --> 09:50.057
SO WE MUST TRICK THIS MIND

09:50.090 --> 09:53.627
INTO GETTING HIM OFF THIS TABLE.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.898
- AUUUGH!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.132
crash!

09:59.166 --> 10:03.170
- OKAY, NOW WE KNOW
IT'S NOT IN HIS MIND.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.337
[gong resounds]

10:04.371 --> 10:07.340
[rock music]

10:07.374 --> 10:11.111
*

10:11.144 --> 10:14.047
- I MISS THEM, BUT AT LEAST
I GET THE PLATINUM CONTROLLER.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.183
- YOU WERE TOO NICE TO THEM.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.384
- KATIE,
THEY'RE MY BEST FRIENDS.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.386
- YOU HAVE TO MANIPULATE THEM.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.221
- GO ON.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.723
- THEY WANT APOLOGIES?

10:22.756 --> 10:24.224
THEN GIVE THEM APOLOGIES.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.226
- BUT THEY WON'T APOLOGIZE.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.361
- AND THAT'S WHERE MANIPULATION
COMES IN.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.667
- IF CARLOS IS SO SORRY,

10:33.701 --> 10:36.103
WHY DOESN'T HE COME HERE
AND SAY SO HIMSELF, HUH?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.839
- YOU KNOW CARLOS AND HIS PRIDE.

10:38.872 --> 10:42.042
BUT HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU THAT
HE'S MAKING YOU A SPECIAL LUNCH

10:42.075 --> 10:44.745
TO SHOW YOU JUST HOW SORRY
HE IS.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.983
- JAMES WANTS TO MAKE ME
A SPECIAL LUNCH?

10:50.017 --> 10:51.885
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST TELL ME
HE'S SORRY?

10:51.919 --> 10:55.989
- OH,
YOU KNOW HIM AND HIS PRIDE.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.158
- WHAT'S HE MAKING ME?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.327
- A NICE HEALTHY SALAD.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.797
- WELL...

11:03.831 --> 11:06.133
LOGAN DOES KNOW
I PREFER A LIGHT LUNCH.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.435
- AND YOU KNOW HE'S GOT
A LOT OF PRIDE,

11:08.468 --> 11:10.270
SO I WOULDN'T EVEN MENTION
THE APOLOGY

11:10.303 --> 11:13.106
AND JUST ENJOY THE LUNCH
HE MADE YOU.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.842
- HMM.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.945
- SOUNDS LIKE A NICE LUNCH,
JAMES.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.168
- THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

11:41.201 --> 11:45.072
- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LOVE TOAST.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.108
- AND HAS ANYONE NOTICED
THAT IT'S BEEN FIVE MINUTES,

11:48.141 --> 11:51.344
AND WE HAVEN'T FOUGHT?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.346
- YEAH.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.750
YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
WE FOUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:56.784 --> 11:57.951
[together]
I KNOW. DITTO.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.053
- SO LET'S ALL RENEW
OUR FRIENDSHIP

12:00.087 --> 12:02.122
WITH A LITTLE
BIO HAZARD BATTLE BLASTING

12:02.155 --> 12:03.857
AND NEVER FIGHT AGAIN.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.326
[together]
YES! WHOO!

12:06.359 --> 12:08.195
[all arguing]

12:08.228 --> 12:10.297
- PUT DOWN THE LAPTOP RIGHT NOW.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.800
- NO, YOU TELL HIM
TO PUT DOWN MY HELMET.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.835
- NOT UNTIL I GET
MY LUCKY COMB BACK.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.503
OH, YOU MEAN THIS COMB?

12:16.536 --> 12:19.039
[all arguing]

12:19.072 --> 12:22.442
- WELL, COUNTING LUNCH, YOU MADE
IT 6 MINUTES WITHOUT FIGHTING.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.378
- SO IT'S GETTING BETTER,
RIGHT?

12:25.412 --> 12:28.748
NOT THE PLATINUM CONTROLLER.

12:44.865 --> 12:48.101
[light jazzy music]

12:48.135 --> 12:50.403
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE'RE FIGHTING SO MUCH.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.005
- YOU'RE GROWING APART.

12:52.039 --> 12:55.108
MOST ADOLESCENT FRIENDSHIPS
EVENTUALLY DECAY

12:55.142 --> 12:56.343
DUE TO DISTRUST AND--

12:56.376 --> 12:58.211
- I MEAN, LAST WEEK,
WE WERE SINGING

12:58.245 --> 13:00.413
AND GETTING READY
FOR A MIGHT-BE WORLD TOUR,

13:00.447 --> 13:03.050
AND NOW WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.852
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST BE HONEST
WITH THEM

13:04.885 --> 13:06.854
AND TELL THEM HOW MUCH
YOU MISS THEM?

13:06.887 --> 13:08.889
- UH, YEAH,
GUYS DON'T DO THAT, MOM.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.557
- OH, YEAH,
BUT THE MANIPULATION THING

13:10.590 --> 13:13.360
WORKED OUT REAL WELL FOR YA.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.262
- YEAH,
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.064
- WELL, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
GET THEM ALL TOGETHER

13:17.097 --> 13:18.198
TO SAY ANYTHING?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.900
- WITH LOVE.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.438
LOVE FIXES LOTS OF THINGS,
OKAY?

13:25.472 --> 13:28.141
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:28.175 --> 13:31.278
YOU'RE RIGHT, BECAUSE
THE ONE THING WE ALL LOVE IS...

13:31.311 --> 13:33.046
BIO HAZARD BATTLE BLAST 5.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.848
I'LL CREATE THE ULTIMATE

13:36.083 --> 13:38.018
THAT THEY HAVE TO COME BACK
TO THE CRIB FOR.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.988
- OR YOU COULD GO OUTSIDE
AND PLAY.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.389
- NAH,
MY WAY IS BETTER.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.058
- UGH.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.493
[telephones ringing]

13:46.526 --> 13:48.061
- WELL,
WHAT ABOUT SWITZERLAND?

13:48.095 --> 13:49.362
THEY LIKE EVERYTHING.

13:49.396 --> 13:53.066
- NOT BIG TIME RUSH,
NOR FINLAND OR NORWAY.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.868
- I JUST NEED ONE
INTERNATIONAL CITY TO MAKE IT

13:54.902 --> 13:56.436
THE ALL OVER THE WORLD TOUR.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.604
AUGH.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.873
- WHAT YOU NEED
IS TO FREE YOUR MIND

13:59.907 --> 14:01.508
FROM ALL ITS NEGATIVITY

14:01.541 --> 14:05.578
AND LET THE HOT HEALING STONES
OF HEALING

14:05.612 --> 14:08.415
DRAW OUT THE PAIN IN YOUR BACK.

14:08.448 --> 14:12.185
- WELL,
THE STONES AREN'T EVEN HOT.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.923
- MY BAD.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.091
- WHOA, WHOA, NO FLAME.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.027
- BACK OFF.
- AUUGH.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.294
- BACK OFF.
THIS CURED THE QUEEN'S ECZEMA.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.462
- OOF, OOF, OOF, OOF.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.897
- GIVE IT TO ME.
- AUUUGH!

14:23.931 --> 14:25.265
- GIVE IT TO ME.

THAT'S A NORTH AMERICAN TOUR.

15:58.191 --> 16:01.228
YOU NEED TO PLAY ANOTHER
CONTINENT FOR A WORLD TOUR.

- AND YOU NEED TO FIX HIM,
SO HE CAN MOVE AGAIN.

HAVE NEVER FACED

SO DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING

- THEN I WILL RESORT TO MORE
WESTERN CHIROPRACTIC METHODS.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.785

- I'LL CRACK THE VERTEBRA,
THEREBY CREATING A SPACE

16:29.356 --> 16:31.624
TO LET THE GOOD VIBES IN.

AHHH!

- OKAY,
THIS GUY'S BASICALLY UNHEALABLE.

- I HATE THAT PRIZE.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.703
NOW,
I AM WALKING OUT OF HERE.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.372

17:52.405 --> 17:55.308
- FINE, WALK OUT ON A LIFETIME
OF FRIENDSHIP

17:55.342 --> 17:57.744
BECAUSE OF ONE BAD WEEK.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.179

I HATE THAT SMELL.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.790

WERE STRUGGLING IN ALGEBRA?

18:10.823 --> 18:12.692
- [silently]
- LOGAN.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.561
- AND, LOGAN,
WHO WAS THERE TO PROTECT YOU

18:14.594 --> 18:16.463
WHEN YOU CALLED THE
WRESTLING TEAM JERKS IN LATIN?

18:18.598 --> 18:19.699

18:22.169 --> 18:23.270
JUST SAYING.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.406
- AND, JAMES, WHO RAN 2 MILES
TO THE NEAREST DRUGSTORE

18:26.439 --> 18:28.908
WHEN YOU RAN OUT OF HAIR GEL
IN THE SIXTH GRADE DANCE?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.578

CARLOS.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.546
HERE'S YOUR HELMET BACK.

- YOU KNOW,
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY

18:46.726 --> 18:48.161
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING
THIS WHOLE TIME.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.896
[together]
BUT IT STOPS NOW.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.464
- FINALLY.

18:51.498 --> 18:55.335
SO WHO WANTS TO PLAY
BIO HAZARD BATTLE BLAST 5?

18:55.368 --> 18:58.571
[all arguing]

18:58.605 --> 18:59.372
- THEY'RE FIGHTING AGAIN.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.640
- I DON'T GET IT.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.609
WE WERE JUST GONNA PLAY A GAME.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.279
A GAME.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.448
IT'S THE GAME.

19:08.481 --> 19:12.285
THE FIGHTING STARTED LAST WEEK
WHEN WE BOUGHT THE GAME.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.520
- HE MIGHT HAVE A POINT.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.587
- THINK ABOUT IT.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.959
- AH, LOOK WHO'S RANKED HIGHER
THAN CARLITOS42

19:19.992 --> 19:22.295
ON THE PAGE FIVE LEADERBOARD.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.663
NICE.

[together]
AUUGH!

19:34.941 --> 19:36.509
- OKAY, BUT WAIT.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.877
WHAT ABOUT MY CEREAL HELMET?

19:37.910 --> 19:41.514
- WELL, I WAS SITTING
AT THE COUNTER

19:41.548 --> 19:43.716
WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT
HOW MY CEREAL

19:43.750 --> 19:45.818
LOOKED LIKE THE SURFACE
OF RING DAR SEVEN,

19:45.852 --> 19:48.255
AND THAT REMINDED ME
HOW CARLOS WOULDN'T SHARE

19:48.288 --> 19:49.656
ANY OF HIS RING DAR
POWER CRYSTALS

19:49.689 --> 19:51.824
IN OUR EARLIER CAMPAIGN,

19:51.858 --> 19:55.628
SO I TOOK IT OUT ON HIS HELMET.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.331
- AUUUGH!

19:58.365 --> 19:59.332
- HUH?

19:59.366 --> 20:00.933
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.272
- ARE YOU GUYS FIGHTING AGAIN?

20:05.305 --> 20:08.275
I SWEAR I AM GONNA TAKE
THAT VIDEO GAME AWAY FROM YOU.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.576
[together] TAKE IT.
WE'RE ARE DONE WITH THIS.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.078
- GOOD.

20:12.111 --> 20:16.516
SO NOW MAYBE YOU WILL FINALLY
GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.551
- MOM, WE'RE NOT EIGHT.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.321
