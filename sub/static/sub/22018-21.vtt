WEBVTT

00:01.141 --> 00:03.041
- Punch Porsche red!
- Ow!

00:03.143 --> 00:04.859
Punch Porsche gray!

00:04.945 --> 00:06.745
What are you two lunatics doing?

00:06.846 --> 00:08.113
Playing Punch Buggy.

00:08.215 --> 00:10.649
Every time you see a Volkswagen Beetle,

00:10.751 --> 00:12.717
you yell out the color
and punch someone.

00:12.818 --> 00:14.152
But we made it Punch Porsche

00:14.254 --> 00:16.154
because in Westport,
there's more of those.

00:16.256 --> 00:17.522
Punch Porsche red!

00:17.624 --> 00:19.758
Ow! Punch Porsche gray!

00:19.860 --> 00:20.959
Your turn, Mrs. Otto!

00:21.061 --> 00:22.193
Ow!

00:22.296 --> 00:23.695
Franklin, new rule.

00:23.764 --> 00:25.730
Don't punch me
or anybody I'm related to.

00:25.832 --> 00:26.831
Unless it's Oliver

00:26.900 --> 00:28.566
and he's talking about French cuffs.

00:28.669 --> 00:30.302
Then go for it.

00:30.404 --> 00:32.671
Wait, that Porsche isn't even gray.

00:32.773 --> 00:33.905
Franklin, it's blue.

00:34.007 --> 00:37.676
I'm colorblind,
so everything looks gray to me.

00:37.778 --> 00:39.311
Punch Porsche gray!

00:39.413 --> 00:40.945
<i>Anna-Kat needs some new friends.</i>

00:41.048 --> 00:42.981
<i>Franklin talks weird, he dresses weird,</i>

00:43.083 --> 00:44.716
<i>he even sees color weird.</i>

00:44.818 --> 00:46.551
<i>He's like the Michael Jordan
of not fitting in.</i>

00:46.620 --> 00:50.722
How about at lunch today,
you don't sit by yourselves?

00:50.824 --> 00:52.424
Invite some new people to join you.

00:52.526 --> 00:54.192
Nah. I won't go into detail,

00:54.294 --> 00:55.955
but kids don't like
to watch Franklin eat.

00:57.130 --> 00:58.863
Ugh. Damn it!

00:58.932 --> 00:59.979
We're out of gas.

01:00.049 --> 01:02.100
Taylor took the car out again
without filling it up.

01:05.105 --> 01:06.705
- Punch Porsche gray!
- If you do it,

01:06.773 --> 01:08.640
you better knock me out,
'cause I'm gonna punch back.

01:19.686 --> 01:20.985
What you working on, Oliver?

01:21.054 --> 01:22.754
I'm trying to come up with a topic

01:22.856 --> 01:24.789
for my persuasive essay for Earth Day.

01:24.858 --> 01:28.026
So far, I have "bring back
plastic grocery bags."

01:28.128 --> 01:29.794
How about writing about something

01:29.896 --> 01:31.963
that's good for the planet,
like recycling?

01:32.065 --> 01:33.732
It's easy to be persuasive
when you're talking

01:33.800 --> 01:35.400
about something as sexy
as saving Mama Earth.

01:35.502 --> 01:37.235
Eh, recycling is out.

01:37.337 --> 01:39.070
It's the fanny pack of causes.

01:39.172 --> 01:41.439
No, recycling never falls
out of fashion.

01:41.541 --> 01:43.375
This woman does a podcast while kayaking

01:43.443 --> 01:44.809
through the garbage island
in the Pacific.

01:44.911 --> 01:48.780
Every episode is just the sounds
of her paddling as she sobs.

01:48.882 --> 01:51.916
I'm gonna paddle right past
that recommendation.

01:51.985 --> 01:53.118
Oliver, you might want to think

01:53.220 --> 01:54.486
about doing your paper on recycling.

01:54.588 --> 01:55.520
I'd help you.

01:55.622 --> 01:56.921
You'd get an "A" from your teacher,

01:57.023 --> 01:57.956
and if you played your cards right...

01:59.159 --> 02:00.425
...a spot on the Recycling Committee.

02:00.527 --> 02:01.960
You mean with you and three janitors?

02:02.062 --> 02:02.994
And Bill Doty.

02:03.063 --> 02:05.163
Taylor, get down here!

02:05.265 --> 02:07.999
I just had to walk 10 miles,
and I'm not happy!

02:08.101 --> 02:09.701
It was three blocks.

02:09.803 --> 02:12.103
You go to the petting zoo
and say you saw a unicorn,

02:12.172 --> 02:13.071
I back you up.

02:13.173 --> 02:14.072
What happened?

02:14.174 --> 02:15.840
We ran out of gas.

02:15.942 --> 02:17.642
Because Taylor didn't
fill the car up last night

02:17.744 --> 02:18.810
after she used it.

02:18.912 --> 02:20.812
I had to ditch it
and walk Franklin home.

02:20.914 --> 02:23.281
You should've checked the gas
when you started the car.

02:23.383 --> 02:24.649
Even beginner drivers know that,

02:24.751 --> 02:26.017
and you're far from a beginner.

02:26.119 --> 02:27.352
You old.

02:27.454 --> 02:29.888
You want to go to this concert
in New York with Trip,

02:29.990 --> 02:32.323
but how can I trust you
if you're not responsible enough

02:32.392 --> 02:33.458
to fill the car up with gas?

02:33.560 --> 02:35.193
With what? I don't have any money.

02:35.295 --> 02:36.428
Good point.

02:36.530 --> 02:39.464
So if you don't have money
and you need money,

02:39.533 --> 02:40.799
what do you do?

02:40.901 --> 02:42.534
Become a YouTube star?

02:42.636 --> 02:44.035
- Rob a bank?
- Make counterfeit bonds?

02:44.137 --> 02:45.370
At least no one said stripping.

02:45.472 --> 02:47.505
No! You get a job!

02:48.708 --> 02:50.041
Mom, Westport kids don't do that.

02:50.143 --> 02:52.243
- Well, you're gonna.
- That's not fair.

02:52.345 --> 02:54.279
You put gas in the car
and you don't have a job.

03:00.654 --> 03:01.553
What did she just say to me?

03:01.655 --> 03:03.888
Taylor, run!

03:03.990 --> 03:05.190
Start a new life.

03:05.292 --> 03:07.792
If you need to change your name,
you look like a Jennifer!

03:09.463 --> 03:12.530
Why are our kids so resistant
to doing what's best for them?

03:12.632 --> 03:14.799
I know. How do they think
they've been alive this long...

03:14.901 --> 03:15.967
making their own decisions?

03:16.069 --> 03:17.869
Of course not. They're idiots.

03:17.938 --> 03:19.170
Remember when Oliver was 6

03:19.272 --> 03:21.172
and we told him that he couldn't
ride a bike without a helmet

03:21.274 --> 03:22.674
so he made one out of a Fruit Roll-up?

03:22.776 --> 03:23.741
Idiots.

03:23.844 --> 03:25.176
Yeah, they don't know
what's good for them.

03:25.278 --> 03:26.978
I'm gonna make sure Taylor gets a job.

03:27.047 --> 03:29.414
And I'm gonna make sure Oliver
writes his paper on recycling.

03:29.483 --> 03:30.882
And I'm gonna get Anna-Kat new friends.

03:30.984 --> 03:32.317
Hey, about the time that Taylor wanted

03:32.419 --> 03:34.018
to run her track-and-field event
with scissors

03:34.120 --> 03:35.720
so she could cut the ribbon
at the finish line?

03:35.822 --> 03:37.255
Ugh. Idiot!

03:37.357 --> 03:38.723
They're idiots.

03:38.748 --> 03:39.801
All of them.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.057
_

03:53.006 --> 03:55.707
Mom said to give you this.

04:01.548 --> 04:02.914
<i>Now let's find some new kids</i>

04:03.016 --> 04:04.516
<i>for Anna-Kat to be friends with.</i>

04:05.886 --> 04:06.885
<i>Maybe her.</i>

04:08.622 --> 04:10.188
<i>Next.</i>

04:10.290 --> 04:12.524
<i>He looks nice.</i>

04:15.161 --> 04:16.327
<i>But all sociopaths do.</i>

04:16.428 --> 04:17.862
<i>Pass.</i>

04:17.964 --> 04:21.165
<i>I don't even have to say
why I don't like that kid.</i>

04:21.267 --> 04:23.968
<i>Ooh. Todd and Mia Anderson.</i>

04:24.037 --> 04:25.537
<i>Normal, fun, popular.</i>

04:25.605 --> 04:28.039
<i>Just the kind of friends
Anna-Kat needs forced on her.</i>

04:28.141 --> 04:30.441
Anna-Kat, why don't you play

04:30.544 --> 04:31.976
with Todd and Mia at recess today?

04:32.078 --> 04:33.611
They seem nice.

04:33.713 --> 04:35.213
But I'd miss Franklin's vacant stare

04:35.315 --> 04:36.748
and giant nose-bubbles.

04:36.816 --> 04:39.017
I love Franklin. Love him.

04:39.119 --> 04:41.352
But sometimes when you play
friendship roulette,

04:41.454 --> 04:43.555
you got to scatt the chips
on some other numbers.

04:43.657 --> 04:45.456
Mama, when it comes
to friendship roulette,

04:45.559 --> 04:47.458
I always bet on gray.

04:47.561 --> 04:49.294
<i>Aww.</i>

04:50.597 --> 04:52.397
<i>Still, kid's weird.</i>

04:53.934 --> 04:56.134
And with a million plastic
bottles bought every minute,

04:56.236 --> 04:57.669
recycling might be our last hope.

04:57.771 --> 04:59.170
Wow, Dad.

04:59.272 --> 05:00.672
- Great stuff, really.
- See?

05:00.740 --> 05:03.341
You were a little reluctant at first,

05:03.443 --> 05:04.809
but now you know the high I feel

05:04.911 --> 05:07.011
every time I sink one
into that beautiful blue bin.

05:07.113 --> 05:08.947
I hear you.

05:11.084 --> 05:12.317
Don't tell your mother,

05:12.419 --> 05:14.118
but I've been saving up
to adopt a highway.

05:14.220 --> 05:15.920
- You in?
- I'm good.

05:16.022 --> 05:17.589
I think I have everything I need.

05:17.691 --> 05:20.658
In fact, the first sentence
is already coming to me.

05:20.727 --> 05:22.493
Say no more. Go get 'em, son.

05:22.596 --> 05:24.128
Change some minds.

05:24.230 --> 05:26.531
I think I will.

05:27.788 --> 05:29.788
_

05:31.438 --> 05:33.938
I want Anna-Kat
to set her sights higher,

05:34.040 --> 05:36.407
so I arranged for two new kids
to join our carpool...

05:36.509 --> 05:37.909
Todd and Mia Anderson.

05:38.011 --> 05:39.510
Ooh, the Anderson twins.

05:39.535 --> 05:40.511
How'd it go?

05:40.614 --> 05:43.281
Let's just say, what a feeling.

05:43.383 --> 05:46.017
♪ What a feeling ♪

05:46.119 --> 05:49.253
♪ Bein's believing ♪

05:49.356 --> 05:51.656
♪ I can have it all ♪

05:51.758 --> 05:55.627
♪ Now I'm dancing for my life ♪

05:55.729 --> 05:56.828
Take it, Todd!

05:56.930 --> 06:02.467
♪ Take your passion and make it happen ♪

06:02.569 --> 06:04.068
Nice pipes, Todd!

06:04.170 --> 06:05.169
Hit it, Franklin!

06:05.271 --> 06:07.405
I pledge allegiance to the flag

06:07.507 --> 06:09.340
of the United States of America.

06:09.442 --> 06:12.410
Oh, Franklin, you are always on.

06:13.279 --> 06:16.514
Soon, Anna-Kat will be
best friends with Todd and Mia,

06:16.616 --> 06:18.683
and her social circle
will keep expanding,

06:18.785 --> 06:20.084
and then her friends will be...

06:21.221 --> 06:23.054
I'm sorry, Doris, am I boring you?

06:23.156 --> 06:26.057
I always tune out the Anna-Kat stuff.

06:26.159 --> 06:27.492
How's the blonde one
with the hot boyfriend?

06:27.594 --> 06:28.726
What's her deal?

06:28.828 --> 06:31.763
I'm forcing her
to get a job against her will.

06:31.865 --> 06:33.331
Just one job?

06:33.433 --> 06:35.533
White parents are so soft.

06:35.635 --> 06:37.201
How does Taylor feel
about having to get a job?

06:37.303 --> 06:39.704
Well, Angela, as her mother,

06:39.806 --> 06:41.272
I don't care how she feels about it.

06:42.642 --> 06:44.375
You're terrible.

06:44.477 --> 06:45.943
Yeah, Mom, you're terrible.

06:48.515 --> 06:49.647
Taylor, what are you doing here?

06:49.716 --> 06:51.282
I got a job like you told me.

06:51.384 --> 06:52.283
I'm your waitress.

06:52.385 --> 06:54.385
But this is where I go

06:54.454 --> 06:56.187
to get away from you and the other two.

06:56.256 --> 06:59.023
Mom, if I would've known I could only
get jobs at places you wouldn't be,

06:59.125 --> 07:00.391
I would've applied at a bookstore.

07:00.493 --> 07:03.061
Ooh-hoo, slam! Katie don't read!

07:03.129 --> 07:04.562
She doesn't read at all.

07:04.587 --> 07:05.630
- Good one.
- Mnh-mnh.

07:05.699 --> 07:07.031
What can I get you?

07:10.782 --> 07:12.806
A toast to Taylor,

07:12.916 --> 07:14.649
our first child getting her first job.

07:14.751 --> 07:16.071
I've had jobs.

07:16.150 --> 07:17.516
You've had schemes, Oliver.

07:17.618 --> 07:18.984
We don't toast to schemes.

07:19.052 --> 07:20.952
Waitressing is so fun.

07:21.021 --> 07:22.854
And it's perfect because
I have first period free,

07:22.956 --> 07:25.190
so I can do the morning shift
without missing class.

07:25.292 --> 07:27.125
I'm so proud of you.

07:27.194 --> 07:29.261
<i>Give her the old fake smile.</i>

07:29.363 --> 07:30.595
<i>Hold it.</i>

07:30.697 --> 07:32.030
<i>I am so good at this.</i>

07:32.132 --> 07:33.932
And you are going to love this.

07:34.034 --> 07:35.934
At work, they have a nickname for Mom.

07:36.003 --> 07:37.068
"Flannels and Flapjacks?"

07:37.137 --> 07:38.537
"The Salt and Pepper Shaker Bandit"?

07:38.639 --> 07:39.804
No. "Crispy,"

07:39.907 --> 07:41.239
because she always sends her bacon back

07:41.341 --> 07:42.607
to make it extra crispy.

07:46.079 --> 07:47.245
Kids, maybe we should cha...

07:47.314 --> 07:48.713
And every day for like two hours,

07:48.815 --> 07:49.714
Mom just sits there

07:49.816 --> 07:51.149
chit-chatting with Angela and Doris.

07:51.251 --> 07:54.619
But you're always complaining
about how busy you are.

07:54.688 --> 07:57.756
And you're constantly telling me
to manage my time better.

07:57.824 --> 08:00.458
You guys must be new here.

08:00.561 --> 08:03.862
I'm Mom, and I can say whatever I want.

08:03.931 --> 08:05.230
Isn't it funny how this morning

08:05.332 --> 08:06.965
I was serving and cleaning up after you,

08:07.067 --> 08:09.201
and now you're serving
and cleaning up after me?

08:09.303 --> 08:12.270
<i>The only thing better than
my fake smile is my fake laugh.</i>

08:16.109 --> 08:18.310
Greg, can I talk to you?

08:18.412 --> 08:20.845
Stewart and Kingston's is mine.

08:20.948 --> 08:23.014
It's my hang out,
where I unwind and vent.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.083
Taylor being there
messes the whole thing up.

08:25.185 --> 08:27.319
Come on. How bad could it be?

08:27.387 --> 08:29.688
So I'm in bed, about to fall asleep

08:29.790 --> 08:32.023
when Greg gives me the old tap-aroo.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.191
- Refill?
- And I'm...

08:34.361 --> 08:36.061
Thanks, sweetie.

08:38.832 --> 08:41.499
Anyways, I'm like, "Greg, it's 11:00,

08:41.602 --> 08:42.667
and we just had chili and"...

08:42.769 --> 08:43.768
Lemons?

08:43.870 --> 08:45.971
We're fine, thank you.

08:46.073 --> 08:48.006
So then I'm about to roll over...

08:48.058 --> 08:49.007
Do you guys need anything else?

08:49.109 --> 08:50.609
No, we are all good.

08:50.744 --> 08:51.876
Just the check.

08:53.113 --> 08:55.146
And then Greg was like,
"It's been two weeks!"

08:55.249 --> 08:56.681
- What's been two weeks?
- Get us the damn check!

09:00.454 --> 09:02.354
You see what I'm dealing with?

09:02.456 --> 09:04.823
So the rule is no intimacy after chili?
I just want to be clear.

09:04.925 --> 09:06.024
That's not the point, Greg.

09:06.126 --> 09:07.292
And yes, that is the rule.

09:07.394 --> 09:08.660
Well, I see why you're upset,

09:08.762 --> 09:10.328
but Taylor did exactly
what you told her to do...

09:10.430 --> 09:12.163
went out and got a job like an adult.

09:12.266 --> 09:14.733
Yes, but she did it in the most
annoying way possible.

09:14.835 --> 09:17.102
Second Breakfast is my sanctuary.

09:17.204 --> 09:18.136
No, I get it.

09:18.272 --> 09:19.371
I wish I had a place to go

09:19.473 --> 09:21.306
and chit-chat with my friends
for hours at a time.

09:21.408 --> 09:24.075
Well, I wish I had a job
where I could go teach one class

09:24.177 --> 09:26.278
then go to my office
and buy mini-muskets on eBay.

09:26.346 --> 09:27.912
Those are investments.

09:27.981 --> 09:30.849
It's important I have
a diversified portfolio.

09:30.951 --> 09:32.484
Stocks, bonds, and muskets.

09:32.586 --> 09:35.754
I just wish Taylor
was working somewhere else.

09:35.856 --> 09:36.955
It's not good for me.

09:37.024 --> 09:39.624
Well, you're just gonna
have to learn to like it.

09:41.028 --> 09:42.827
And I guess you're going
to have to learn

09:42.929 --> 09:45.730
to like the paper Oliver wrote
on recycling.

09:48.435 --> 09:51.403
"Why Recycling is a Complete
Sham, by Oliver Otto."

09:51.505 --> 09:52.871
Mm.

09:54.875 --> 09:58.109
How could he write
this piece of compost?

10:02.382 --> 10:05.784
So, I found a copy of your
paper in the printer.

10:05.886 --> 10:07.419
Oh, yeah. Thanks for all your help.

10:07.521 --> 10:08.453
I'm really proud of it.

10:08.555 --> 10:10.188
Proud. Huh.

10:10.290 --> 10:11.623
Strange.

10:11.725 --> 10:12.891
Because everything in it

10:12.993 --> 10:15.260
is a giant, steaming pile
of horsefeathers!

10:15.362 --> 10:17.429
Dad, language. Are we in the Wild West?

10:17.531 --> 10:18.730
How could you write that

10:18.832 --> 10:20.532
- recycling is bad for the environment?
- Listen.

10:20.634 --> 10:22.901
My assignment was to write
a persuasive argument.

10:22.969 --> 10:24.436
After hearing you out,

10:24.538 --> 10:26.304
I decided to take the other side,

10:26.406 --> 10:27.539
the side of the truth...

10:27.641 --> 10:29.240
recycling is very expensive,

10:29.343 --> 10:31.576
and it requires more resources
than it preserves.

10:31.678 --> 10:33.478
- Balderdash!
- Dad.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.880
Here's a truth for you...
you are not handing in this paper.

10:35.982 --> 10:37.015
Too late. I already did.

10:37.117 --> 10:38.249
Well, you deserve
the "F" you're gonna get.

10:38.352 --> 10:39.718
Well, that's cool 'cause
I already got an "A."

10:39.820 --> 10:41.553
An "A?!"

10:43.690 --> 10:45.623
Ach.

10:47.828 --> 10:49.685
Fiddlesticks!

10:49.810 --> 10:51.810
Fiddlesticks!

10:52.443 --> 10:54.443
Fiddlesticks!

10:59.172 --> 11:00.438
See?

11:00.540 --> 11:02.807
Anna-Kat, aren't Todd and Mia
really nice?

11:02.909 --> 11:03.942
I don't know, Mama.

11:04.044 --> 11:05.443
They don't go good with Franklin.

11:05.545 --> 11:06.611
Where is Franklin?

11:06.747 --> 11:09.013
Oh, my God.

11:09.116 --> 11:10.849
I forgot to pick him up.
Why didn't you say something?

11:10.951 --> 11:13.618
I was assuming he was coming in late.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.653
Dude's got a lot
of doctor's appointments.

11:16.656 --> 11:18.456
You were so busy
cozying up to Todd and Mia,

11:18.558 --> 11:19.691
you forgot about Franklin.

11:19.793 --> 11:21.860
I'll go get him now.

11:21.962 --> 11:23.161
Franklin!

11:23.263 --> 11:25.163
You forgot to pick up my son.

11:25.232 --> 11:26.865
If I wanted him to stand
by the front door

11:26.967 --> 11:28.767
waiting for a ride
that was never going to come,

11:28.869 --> 11:30.635
I would've asked my ex-husband
to pick him up.

11:30.737 --> 11:34.372
I am so sorry.
It will never happen again.

11:34.441 --> 11:36.007
Well, it certainly can't.

11:38.011 --> 11:40.044
But it might.

11:40.147 --> 11:42.447
I am so forgetful.

11:42.549 --> 11:45.049
Well, then Franklin is
no longer in your carpool.

11:45.152 --> 11:47.385
I will be driving him myself
from now on.

11:47.487 --> 11:50.388
Oh no, don't. Please reconsider.

11:54.995 --> 11:56.261
Excuse me, Mrs. Austin?

11:56.363 --> 11:58.563
I want to talk to you
about my son's grade.

11:58.665 --> 12:02.167
I'm sure your child
worked hard on their paper,

12:02.269 --> 12:03.635
but I can't just raise grades

12:03.737 --> 12:05.837
every time a parent
comes in here and complains.

12:05.906 --> 12:07.739
I'm not asking you to raise
his grade. Oliver got an "A."

12:07.841 --> 12:09.374
Then what are we doing here?

12:09.476 --> 12:10.875
I just can't believe you would encourage

12:10.977 --> 12:12.343
that kind of blasphemy against nature.

12:12.446 --> 12:15.847
Mr. Otto, are you asking me
to lower your son's grade?

12:15.949 --> 12:17.482
Because that would be a first.

12:17.584 --> 12:19.451
No, of course not.

12:19.553 --> 12:22.554
I would never ask you to do
something so unethical.

12:27.694 --> 12:29.060
A Starbucks card?

12:29.129 --> 12:32.864
Still has $7 on it. Enjoy.

12:32.966 --> 12:35.333
Oliver's assignment was to write

12:35.435 --> 12:37.302
a convincing argument.

12:37.370 --> 12:39.103
He did that very well.

12:39.206 --> 12:41.005
Hence, the "A."

12:41.107 --> 12:42.440
But it was all nonsense.

12:42.509 --> 12:43.741
I should know. I'm chairman
of the Recycling Committee.

12:43.844 --> 12:45.944
Oh, that's just you and three janitors.

12:46.046 --> 12:47.345
And Bill Doty.

12:47.447 --> 12:49.247
Hey, I used to believe
in recycling, too.

12:49.349 --> 12:51.916
But Oliver's paper
drew the curtain back for me.

12:52.018 --> 12:54.919
I now see that recycling
is a waste of resources

12:55.021 --> 12:56.821
and a complete sham.

12:56.890 --> 13:00.258
From now on, everything
goes in one big bin.

13:02.996 --> 13:03.962
Two points.

13:04.064 --> 13:05.463
Doing that on Earth Day

13:05.565 --> 13:09.267
is like spitting in Santa
Claus' face on Christmas.

13:11.805 --> 13:14.038
Unless you practice a different faith.

13:14.107 --> 13:16.307
In which case, please transfer
my insult to your beliefs!

13:22.249 --> 13:24.015
So yeah, I forgot to pick up Franklin,

13:24.117 --> 13:26.584
but maybe him being out
of carpool is a good thing.

13:26.686 --> 13:28.086
Yeah, you know, I like my kids to have

13:28.188 --> 13:29.387
as few friends as possible.

13:29.489 --> 13:30.421
It keeps the noise down,

13:30.524 --> 13:32.156
and birthday parties are easy to plan.

13:32.225 --> 13:34.792
Now Anna-Kat can focus on Todd and Mia.

13:34.895 --> 13:35.927
She doesn't realize it,

13:36.029 --> 13:37.562
but those are the right friends for her.

13:37.664 --> 13:38.930
Eh, I don't know, Mom.

13:39.032 --> 13:40.298
Anna-Kat really likes Franklin.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.666
Thank you, waitress,

13:41.735 --> 13:44.469
for your insight
on my parenting techniques.

13:44.571 --> 13:45.603
Come on, Mom.

13:45.705 --> 13:46.771
It's unfair that you don't think

13:46.873 --> 13:48.139
we're old enough to pick our own friends

13:48.241 --> 13:49.774
or go to New York to see a concert.

13:49.876 --> 13:51.476
Don't you have someplace to be?

13:51.578 --> 13:53.077
Yeah. Here.

13:53.179 --> 13:54.445
Because you forced me to get a job.

13:54.548 --> 13:56.281
You know, when I was 16, I went on tour

13:56.383 --> 13:57.982
with Bell Biv DeVoe for a summer.

13:58.084 --> 14:00.051
Yeah. That song "Poison"...

14:00.120 --> 14:02.186
is about me.

14:03.290 --> 14:05.256
Hold on.

14:05.358 --> 14:06.791
I ordered a muffin.

14:06.893 --> 14:07.992
Oh.

14:08.094 --> 14:09.694
Ah, sorry, Mom. I already
put it in the computer.

14:09.763 --> 14:10.862
Enjoy.

14:10.964 --> 14:12.063
Excuse me.

14:12.165 --> 14:14.198
I ordered a muffin, and I want a muffin.

14:14.301 --> 14:16.301
I'm not treating you any
differently than any other waiter

14:16.403 --> 14:17.702
just because you're my daughter.

14:17.804 --> 14:20.505
Mom, they're all basically
just desserts for breakfast.

14:20.607 --> 14:21.606
What's the big deal?

14:21.708 --> 14:23.508
How can I trust you to go to New York

14:23.610 --> 14:25.710
- if you can't even get my order right?
- God, Mom. Chill!

14:25.812 --> 14:27.812
First off, I hate it
when you tell me to chill.

14:27.881 --> 14:30.348
And second, you screwed up
my order, now fix it.

14:30.450 --> 14:31.482
You're becoming hostile.

14:31.585 --> 14:32.684
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

14:32.786 --> 14:35.720
You can't kick me out!
I'm the Norm of this place!

14:37.157 --> 14:39.157
You're anyone,
and I'm refusing to serve you.

14:39.259 --> 14:40.158
Now get out!

14:40.260 --> 14:41.593
Taylor, what's going on?

14:41.695 --> 14:44.128
This woman was acting unruly,
and I asked her to leave.

14:44.230 --> 14:46.698
This child didn't serve me
the correct order.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.500
And when I politely complained,
she kicked me out.

14:49.603 --> 14:51.903
- Taylor, the customer is always right.
- Mm-hmm.

14:52.005 --> 14:53.171
If Crispy...

14:53.273 --> 14:54.839
I mean, if this
reasonable lady is unhappy,

14:54.908 --> 14:56.407
it's our job to fix it.

14:56.509 --> 14:57.575
So fix it.

14:57.677 --> 14:59.143
Then come talk to me
at the end of your shift.

15:02.138 --> 15:03.081
Hmm.

15:03.183 --> 15:04.983
Publicly shaming her daughter

15:05.085 --> 15:07.085
in her own workplace?

15:07.988 --> 15:09.320
I'm really starting to see

15:09.422 --> 15:11.422
my influence on you.

15:14.995 --> 15:18.499
These parental controls
are really cramping my style.

15:18.590 --> 15:20.123
Screen time over.

15:20.187 --> 15:24.055
Why don't we set up a play date
with Todd and Mia?

15:24.157 --> 15:25.223
Or Franklin.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.391
Or Todd and Mia.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.592
Or Franklin.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.795
Maybe he's weird to you, Mama,
but not to me.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.931
And now he's not in carpool anymore,

15:33.033 --> 15:34.532
and I don't get to see him as much

15:34.634 --> 15:36.067
because you forgot to pick him up.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.736
- Anna-Kat, the thing is...
- My teacher just e-mailed me.

15:38.839 --> 15:40.138
You tried to get my grade lowered!

15:40.207 --> 15:42.307
- Oliver the thing is...
- You got me fired!

15:42.440 --> 15:43.998
- Taylor the thing is...
- You got her fired?

15:44.061 --> 15:45.943
Not on purpose.
She was being a bad waitress.

15:45.998 --> 15:48.021
And it is my duty
as your mother to make sure

15:48.092 --> 15:49.698
that you follow through
on your responsibilities.

15:49.779 --> 15:51.300
I was doing just fine

15:51.368 --> 15:53.902
until Crispy gets the wrong carb
and raises hell.

15:54.004 --> 15:56.038
- Hey!
- Yeah, just like Dad did with my paper.

15:56.148 --> 15:57.506
And Mom did with my Franklin.

15:57.608 --> 15:58.984
Katie, our kids appear
to have unionized.

15:59.054 --> 16:00.175
- We've got a problem.
- Ugh.

16:00.244 --> 16:02.311
- Permission to speak for the group?
- Yeah, go ahead.

16:02.413 --> 16:04.112
You guys are really screwing us!

16:04.215 --> 16:06.315
We want our friends back, our jobs back,

16:06.417 --> 16:07.849
and I don't remember
what Oliver's thing is,

16:07.918 --> 16:09.084
but he wants that back, too.

16:09.153 --> 16:10.852
You guys say you're doing
what's best for us,

16:10.955 --> 16:12.521
but really, you're doing
what's best for you.

16:12.623 --> 16:15.424
You wanted me to hang out
with the friends you like.

16:15.526 --> 16:16.491
And you wanted me to write a paper

16:16.527 --> 16:17.426
on a topic that you liked.

16:17.561 --> 16:18.760
And you wanted me to get a job

16:18.862 --> 16:20.195
at a place that was good for you.

16:20.297 --> 16:21.296
They're onto us. Do something.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.965
We don't have to explain
ourselves to you.

16:23.033 --> 16:25.100
We are the parents,
and what we say goes.

16:25.202 --> 16:28.170
And I say go to your rooms!

16:35.512 --> 16:37.846
Wow. I'm glad that worked.

16:37.948 --> 16:39.047
That was getting ugly.

16:39.149 --> 16:40.515
Yeah, did you see that look
in Anna-Kat's eyes?

16:40.618 --> 16:41.783
I thought she wanted to fight me.

16:41.885 --> 16:44.286
You went to school
to badmouth your son's paper.

16:44.355 --> 16:45.387
Who are you to talk?

16:45.489 --> 16:46.888
You told our daughter to get a job

16:46.991 --> 16:48.223
and then you got her fired?

16:48.325 --> 16:50.225
And you broke up your
other daughter's friendship.

16:50.327 --> 16:52.461
You went to school to badmouth
your son's paper.

16:52.563 --> 16:53.895
You already said that.

16:53.964 --> 16:56.531
Well, you only did one thing,
so I had to say it twice.

16:56.634 --> 16:58.700
So... what are we gonna do?

16:58.769 --> 17:02.437
Well, we could clean-slate it,

17:02.473 --> 17:04.106
go to Baja, have three new kids,

17:04.208 --> 17:05.741
start fresh...

17:05.843 --> 17:07.376
or make it up to them.

17:07.478 --> 17:09.144
I guess we have to make it up to them.

17:09.246 --> 17:11.213
You are never gonna say Baja, are you?

17:11.315 --> 17:13.281
Someday.

17:17.554 --> 17:19.887
Can I help you?

17:19.990 --> 17:21.156
I was wrong.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.726
I wanted you to see things the way I do,

17:24.828 --> 17:27.462
but you're your own person,
and I need to respect that.

17:27.564 --> 17:29.164
Uh-huh.

17:29.266 --> 17:35.304
And to make it up to you...
I'm going to do this.

17:40.244 --> 17:43.278
Wow, Dad.

17:43.380 --> 17:44.513
You did that for me?

17:44.615 --> 17:45.747
Yeah.

17:45.849 --> 17:47.316
On Earth Day?

17:47.384 --> 17:49.685
You know a bird could crawl
into that bottle and die.

17:49.787 --> 17:51.753
I know.

17:51.855 --> 17:53.955
I accept your apology.

17:56.327 --> 17:57.559
I'm just gonna leave that there.

18:02.132 --> 18:03.298
Hey.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.133
Are you here to punish me

18:05.202 --> 18:07.102
or apologize for making me get a job

18:07.204 --> 18:08.370
and then getting me fired?

18:08.472 --> 18:12.774
I told you to get a job,
and you got a job.

18:12.876 --> 18:14.376
You did everything right.

18:14.478 --> 18:15.844
Mm-hmm.

18:15.946 --> 18:19.181
And just because it wasn't
the perfect place for me,

18:19.283 --> 18:21.049
- I blew it up.
- Mm-hmm.

18:21.151 --> 18:23.952
But we will find you a new job together

18:24.021 --> 18:26.755
as soon as you get back
from the concert in New York.

18:27.791 --> 18:28.990
- Wait. Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

18:29.093 --> 18:30.158
- I can go?
- Yeah.

18:30.260 --> 18:32.027
Oh my God, Mom, you're the best!

18:33.364 --> 18:36.031
You are right. Wonder Mom is the best.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.132
Who?

18:37.234 --> 18:38.734
You know. Wonder Mom.

18:38.836 --> 18:40.902
Are you trying to
make a nickname for yourself?

18:41.004 --> 18:42.571
Because that's not how nicknames work.

18:42.673 --> 18:44.973
Wonder Mom begs to differ.

18:45.075 --> 18:46.808
Sorry, Crispy. Not happening.

18:53.417 --> 18:54.850
Left foot gray.

18:54.952 --> 18:56.718
Thanks for giving us a second chance.

18:56.820 --> 18:59.454
Of course.
Franklin really missed Anna-Kat.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.457
Right hand gray.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.259
Now that the kids are back together,

19:04.361 --> 19:06.328
maybe you and I
could be friends, as well.

19:06.430 --> 19:09.231
Sure. That sounds great.

19:09.299 --> 19:11.767
<i>Franklin's a weirdo,
but she doesn't seem so...</i>

19:11.902 --> 19:13.068
I'm a ghost.

19:14.037 --> 19:15.103
Mm.

19:15.205 --> 19:18.740
I pledge allegiance
to the flag... Anna-Kat?

19:18.842 --> 19:21.176
Of the United States of America.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.177
And to the republic...

19:22.279 --> 19:23.545
Franklin, bring us home!

19:23.647 --> 19:26.214
♪ What a feeling ♪

19:26.250 --> 19:28.517
♪ Bein's believing ♪

19:28.619 --> 19:33.488
♪ I can have it all,
now I'm dancing for my life ♪

19:33.590 --> 19:34.823
Classic Franklin.

19:34.892 --> 19:37.893
Just when you think
he's gonna zig, he zags.

19:37.995 --> 19:43.532
♪ Take your passion, make it happen ♪

19:48.913 --> 19:50.506
What are you doing, Dad?

19:50.601 --> 19:52.168
Billy D and the rest of the Re-psychos

19:52.270 --> 19:53.235
are coming over in a few.

19:53.337 --> 19:54.670
We're gonna celebrate Earth Day.

19:54.772 --> 19:57.907
Huh. That's a lot of napkins.

19:58.009 --> 20:00.242
You'll end up throwing them
in a recycling bin, of course,

20:00.344 --> 20:01.944
but then they'll end up in a landfill.

20:02.046 --> 20:05.214
Stop. You're not gonna turn me
like you did Mrs. Austin.

20:05.316 --> 20:07.049
Good-looking cake.

20:07.151 --> 20:10.019
Nice box. Wasteful.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.620
Recycled cardboard.

20:11.723 --> 20:13.189
It's not bedtime, Dad.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.024
Why are you telling me a fairytale?

20:16.294 --> 20:18.894
Is that all you got?
You're embarrassing yourself.

20:23.801 --> 20:25.801
Bill, he's got in my head again.

20:25.903 --> 20:27.203
He said that the cake boxes
aren't recycled.

20:27.305 --> 20:29.638
Can that be? Talk me down.
