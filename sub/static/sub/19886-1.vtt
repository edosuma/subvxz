WEBVTT

00:06.305 --> 00:07.261
Ah!

00:07.773 --> 00:10.809
Hurry, Casey, we
gotta stop this freak-job!

00:10.810 --> 00:12.511
Did you see what
he tried to do back there? Oof!

00:12.512 --> 00:15.380
His butt belongs to Casey Jones.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074

00:25.911 --> 00:27.609
He's getting away!

00:30.592 --> 00:31.472
Casey!

00:31.497 --> 00:33.077
Sorry, dude.

00:39.673 --> 00:43.164
Okay, evil glowing eyes,
never a good sign.

00:54.487 --> 00:55.974
What the heck are they?

00:56.850 --> 00:59.033
Not human dudes, dude.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.230
It's all good though.
We got these punks.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.258
Are you crazy?
There's too many.

01:07.283 --> 01:09.910
Casey Jones never runs from a fight.

01:10.072 --> 01:11.914
Whoa! Ahh!

01:11.939 --> 01:13.912
No!

01:25.384 --> 01:27.385
Ahh!

01:53.012 --> 01:55.200
Now we're talking.
Yeah!

01:55.814 --> 01:57.198
I've got an idea.

01:58.875 --> 02:00.709
Aww, sewer apples.

02:01.053 --> 02:03.047
Booyakasha!

02:16.975 --> 02:20.175

02:29.476 --> 02:33.109
Aww, yeah!
VHS tape mission accomplished.

02:33.110 --> 02:35.145
Check it out.
I found them in the basement

02:35.146 --> 02:37.180
of this video store
that went out of business.

02:37.181 --> 02:39.924
the last video tape store
in the whole city, dude.

02:41.853 --> 02:44.554
Yes! Holy geek-out, wingnut.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.057
This is so awesome.

02:46.058 --> 02:47.991
Mikey, pizza is on me tonight.

02:47.992 --> 02:49.159
Get whatever you want.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.461
Booyakasha-na-na-na-na.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.758
Um, what are you fan-boying
so hard over, Leo?

02:55.266 --> 02:57.535
Mikey managed to track down
all these old super rare

02:57.536 --> 03:00.304
VHS tapes of "Space-Heroes:
The Next Generation."

03:00.305 --> 03:03.524
The official sequel to the
original "Space-Heroes."

03:03.708 --> 03:05.309
These are from the early 90s,

03:05.310 --> 03:07.210
but most of the tapes
were put in a landfill

03:07.211 --> 03:09.746
because the show was
deemed too disturbing for kids.

03:26.231 --> 03:28.665
Captain Ryan, the Nefrini are
sending out

03:28.666 --> 03:30.468
an urgent com signal!
Ayy!

03:30.469 --> 03:32.799
Put them on the screen,
Crankshaw Junior.

03:33.891 --> 03:36.950
Captain Ryan, the Nefrini
people feel it is unfair

03:36.975 --> 03:39.310
that the Confederation is taxing
our trade routes,

03:39.335 --> 03:41.545
- and we would ask you...
- Blah, blah, blah.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.609
Do you see what my
hand is doing, Nefrini?

03:43.634 --> 03:47.289
It's a puppet
that is mocking you. Boring!

03:47.351 --> 03:50.624
Mr. Crankshaw, let's blow
these aliens out of the water.

03:50.649 --> 03:53.368
And by water, I mean space!

03:53.468 --> 03:56.793
But... but sir!
The Nefrini are a peaceful race!

03:56.794 --> 03:59.609
We can't just destroy them!
Ahh!

03:59.763 --> 04:02.114
Fire photogenic missiles!

04:07.839 --> 04:09.906
Yes! So awesome!

04:09.907 --> 04:11.575
Eh, it's no Crognard.

04:11.576 --> 04:14.078
This is just as lame
as the first Space-Heroes.

04:14.079 --> 04:17.682
Lame? It's making my eyeballs
melt with joy.

04:17.707 --> 04:20.887
- I love this cartoon!
- Ah.

04:23.348 --> 04:24.805
What the heck happened?

04:26.223 --> 04:28.488
We were on our way back from
patrolling the city,

04:29.227 --> 04:32.529
when we found this crazy robed
cultist-looking guy

04:32.530 --> 04:35.120
about to perform what looked
like a sacrifice...

04:35.145 --> 04:38.825
So Casey Jones
and his sidekick, Raph, gave chase.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.164
Sidekick?

04:40.538 --> 04:42.572
We tried to corner the robed dude,

04:42.573 --> 04:44.524
but he escaped at the last second.

04:45.109 --> 04:47.611
Escaped? Clearly they kicked
our butts to Queens,

04:47.612 --> 04:48.669
but whatever.

04:48.694 --> 04:50.461
There were way more of them than us.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.973
What the heck were they?
Human? Robot? Mutant?

04:54.051 --> 04:55.460
Kangaroo men?

04:56.090 --> 04:58.289
I don't know, but whatever they were,

04:58.290 --> 05:00.524
they were faster and way stronger.

05:00.549 --> 05:03.183
Even by my standards,
and that means something.

05:03.461 --> 05:05.363
My security sensors
have been picking up

05:05.364 --> 05:07.148
more homeless people in the sewers.

05:07.399 --> 05:09.563
At least I thought
they were homeless people.

05:09.734 --> 05:12.825
If these creatures
are performing weird sacrifices,

05:12.850 --> 05:14.924
then we need to do something about it.

05:19.549 --> 05:22.699
Children, heed my words.

05:22.847 --> 05:26.127
We are close at hand
to bringing about his return.

05:26.384 --> 05:29.686
But we must find the Scroll
of the Demodragon.

05:29.687 --> 05:33.656
With it, we will be able
to summon a mighty being

05:33.681 --> 05:37.574
who has the power to bring forth
the Master himself.

05:37.693 --> 05:39.649
It waits for us in this city.

05:39.770 --> 05:42.226
Go forth and capture the scroll.

05:42.501 --> 05:44.714
Do not fail me!

05:45.739 --> 05:48.082
I just upgraded
these new motion detectors

05:48.107 --> 05:49.859
to track down our robed friends.

05:49.941 --> 05:52.466
Now if they're in these sewers
within a five mile radius,

05:52.491 --> 05:55.198
- we'll find them.
- Sweet.

05:55.223 --> 05:57.897
We split up and put these things
within five miles of the lair.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.209
Let's do this, team.

06:00.946 --> 06:02.703
Uh-huh. Yeah.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.041
Huh?

06:17.401 --> 06:18.260
Heh.

06:22.274 --> 06:24.441
Oh, man.
A motion sensor is going off

06:24.442 --> 06:26.510
right down that tunnel.
Come on, Mikey.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.612
Whoa, dude.
Should we call the guys?

06:28.613 --> 06:30.486
We can handle this.
Let's move.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.125
There he is...

07:19.513 --> 07:23.933
Mavakaaa sekulaa nadavaaaa.

07:23.934 --> 07:28.204
Mavakaaa sekulaa nadavaaaa.

07:28.229 --> 07:32.375
- Mavakaaa sekul...
- Booyakasha!

07:33.444 --> 07:36.173
You're not going anywhere
with that old paper, dudes!

07:37.530 --> 07:40.216
Hiya... whoa.

07:42.717 --> 07:43.673
Ew.

07:43.698 --> 07:44.878
Ahh!

07:52.006 --> 07:53.100
Wah!

08:14.919 --> 08:15.952
No!

08:42.580 --> 08:46.356
Let me go, you creepy ghoul!
Leo!

08:53.034 --> 08:54.239
Mikey!

09:03.212 --> 09:05.717
- You okay, little brother?
- Not really.

09:05.742 --> 09:06.515
Huh?

09:24.262 --> 09:26.031
They caught my blades in their hands

09:26.032 --> 09:28.738
like they were plastic toys.
It was crazy.

09:28.968 --> 09:30.227
You should have called us, man.

09:30.252 --> 09:31.461
We could have been back-up.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.070
Guys, listen up!

09:33.071 --> 09:34.173
This is important.

09:34.368 --> 09:36.617
So the penthouse belongs
to a wealthy collector

09:36.642 --> 09:39.411
of the weird and obscure,
mostly magical stuff.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.647
Sounds like the perfect candidate
for I'm the boss of a freaky cult.

09:43.648 --> 09:45.784
I think this is the scroll they stole:

09:45.785 --> 09:47.555
The Scroll of the Demodragon.

09:47.641 --> 09:50.443
A scroll?
Like a magic scroll?

09:50.468 --> 09:52.768
Aww, man, I hate magic.

09:52.824 --> 09:56.260
It's an ancient evocation said
to summon a powerful monster

09:56.285 --> 09:57.782
called Kavaxas.

09:57.807 --> 10:00.703
Kavaxas belongs to a mythical
race of Demodragons

10:00.728 --> 10:02.535
believed to reside in the Netherworld.

10:02.625 --> 10:05.470
Magicians are rumored to have
summoned them for millennia,

10:05.471 --> 10:07.980
their efforts always ending in tragedy.

10:08.224 --> 10:09.510
Eh, sounds like a bunch of

10:09.535 --> 10:11.046
- nonsense to me. 
- Whoa.

10:14.723 --> 10:18.450
Aww yeah, ghoul-busting
Mikey to the rescue!

10:18.475 --> 10:19.131
Ow!

10:20.585 --> 10:24.628
What'd I tell you about the
imagination thing, huh? Focus!

10:25.399 --> 10:26.867
What have you got, Donnie?

10:26.892 --> 10:28.493
Well, with the new sensors...

10:28.494 --> 10:30.161
I've determined
a clear pattern of movement.

10:30.162 --> 10:33.364
Right here under the south-east
part of Lower Manhattan.

10:33.365 --> 10:34.966
And here and here.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.134
But they all converge
at what appears to be

10:37.135 --> 10:39.149
a dead-end at this one place.

10:39.413 --> 10:42.016
Hmm, you think this is where they live?

10:42.065 --> 10:46.102
Whoo, if they're actually alive.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.686
Do not be sad, my son.

10:53.251 --> 10:54.404
Father.

11:00.165 --> 11:04.268
Leonardo, I know you feel the
weight of leading your family,

11:04.293 --> 11:07.774
but remember, I am always with you.

11:07.799 --> 11:11.020
Sensei, we're facing something
we've never encountered before,

11:11.045 --> 11:13.853
and I can sense something
really bad on the horizon.

11:14.039 --> 11:15.327
What can I do?

11:15.898 --> 11:17.926
Find the light within.

11:17.953 --> 11:22.347
It is the only thing that can save you
against these creatures of darkness.

11:22.681 --> 11:26.028
These beings are not
what they appear to be.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.562
Then what are they?

11:27.687 --> 11:31.181
What are what?
Uh, who you talking to, Leo?

11:31.206 --> 11:32.160
It was...

11:35.112 --> 11:37.950
No one.
Come on, let's head out.

11:59.140 --> 12:01.447
Hmm. This is the place
where they meet up.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.353
Doesn't look suspicious.

12:04.623 --> 12:06.824
I sense something strange close by,

12:06.825 --> 12:08.226
but I can't pinpoint it.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.242
Maybe we should spread out
more. Look around.

12:12.346 --> 12:15.535
Dudes, we got creepers
creeping stage right!

12:37.156 --> 12:39.091
Whoa!

13:02.715 --> 13:07.018
Mavakaaa sekulaa nadavaaaa.

13:07.043 --> 13:11.386
Mavakaaa sekulaa nadavaaaa.

13:11.856 --> 13:16.173
Mavakaaa sekulaa nadavaaaa.

13:16.428 --> 13:20.431
Mavakaaa sekulaa nadavaaaa.

13:20.456 --> 13:24.460
Mavakaaa sekulaa nadavaaaa.

13:24.485 --> 13:25.911
Whoa.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.289
Children. Our time is nigh.

13:31.403 --> 13:35.952
We finally have the Scroll
of the Demodragon in our possession!

13:36.118 --> 13:38.116
Now we shall summon a being

13:38.117 --> 13:42.494
who will give us
all the power we will ever need!

13:43.146 --> 13:45.772
Tiger Claw is the cult leader?!

13:46.291 --> 13:49.294
Excellent work, my Foot Cultists.

13:49.319 --> 13:53.921
You understand the higher truth
of our goal.

13:54.581 --> 14:00.170
Now I will use the
scroll to summon Kavaxas.

14:00.171 --> 14:03.307
And with this
mystic Seal of the Ancients,

14:03.308 --> 14:07.475
I will control him, and be his master.

14:07.512 --> 14:11.540
- Okay, this is not good.
- We need a plan of attack.

14:16.410 --> 14:20.058
Uh, everyone distract them
while Raph and I get that seal.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.826
- Let's do it. I'm ready.
- Me too.

14:22.827 --> 14:25.493
I'm pretty sure
these guys are ready too.

14:27.129 --> 14:28.864
Aww, sewer pickles.

14:29.350 --> 14:31.069
You couldn't sense them, Red?

14:31.069 --> 14:33.248
Their minds aren't like human minds.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.603
My old enemies.

14:41.628 --> 14:43.163
Perfect timing.

14:43.188 --> 14:45.848
Now you can bare witness.

14:46.810 --> 14:48.344
The Foot are finished.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.078
Why'd you come back, Tiger Claw?

14:50.079 --> 14:51.806
So we can beat you again?

14:51.948 --> 14:54.349
The Foot is by no means finished.

14:54.350 --> 14:56.018
Look all around you.

14:56.019 --> 14:58.221
We have been reborn.

14:58.222 --> 15:01.791
After our last battle,
the Foot went underground.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.925
And in these very sewers,

15:03.950 --> 15:06.590
we discovered a
strange race of creatures

15:06.615 --> 15:09.204
completely dedicated to the Shredder.

15:09.532 --> 15:11.299
And who are these freaks?

15:11.300 --> 15:14.433
Something you couldn't
possibly understand.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.374
Make them watch.

15:18.092 --> 15:19.708
Let us go, Tiger Dude.

15:19.709 --> 15:22.436
Or I'll knock all nine lives
out of you.

15:22.531 --> 15:26.425
You will bear witness to the
summoning of a greater being,

15:26.516 --> 15:31.146
Kavaxas, the most powerful
of all the Demodragons.

15:31.414 --> 15:35.166
And his power will soon belong to me.

15:51.497 --> 15:54.444
Navasa, zaan, kanda,

15:54.445 --> 15:59.332
athrovaxa, noruto, zavasay.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.652
Mavakaa sekulaa.

16:04.677 --> 16:08.809
Mavakaaa sekulaa nadavaaaa.

16:08.925 --> 16:13.462
Mavakaaa sekulaa nadavaaaa.

16:13.463 --> 16:15.616
Kavaxas!

16:41.718 --> 16:45.427
Mortal! You dare call upon Kavaxas?

16:45.428 --> 16:49.298
Lord of the Demodragons,
Ruler of the Netherworld?!

16:49.299 --> 16:54.278
I will burn you and the rest
of these abominations to ash.

16:59.041 --> 17:01.767
You will do nothing but obey me.

17:02.079 --> 17:05.667
Ahh!
The Seal of the Ancients.

17:05.915 --> 17:09.086
You are wiser than I thought, creature.

17:09.484 --> 17:11.290
Very well then.

17:11.421 --> 17:16.126
What would you have me do, Master?

17:17.343 --> 17:20.305
You will destroy the Turtles
and their human allies,

17:20.306 --> 17:22.678
as a sign of fidelity to the Foot.

17:22.828 --> 17:26.935
Make it slow.
Make it... painful.

17:26.936 --> 17:29.060
As you command.

17:35.111 --> 17:38.080
Um, I have some spare pizza
here for you.

17:38.081 --> 17:40.575
It's an inter-dimensional
sign of love.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.308
Man, dragon-dude, you don't have
to be such a hot-head.

17:45.333 --> 17:46.408
Get him!

17:58.902 --> 18:00.006
Ahh!

18:00.874 --> 18:01.787
Ugh.

18:07.361 --> 18:08.425
Ahh!

18:17.314 --> 18:18.477
No, Kavaxas.

18:18.502 --> 18:21.441
Attack only the Turtles
and their allies.

18:22.593 --> 18:25.175
You will obey me.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.694
Yes, Master.

18:38.861 --> 18:41.542
Ahh!

18:41.677 --> 18:43.567
Yeah boy!

19:12.309 --> 19:13.074
Duck!

19:18.214 --> 19:20.183
The mortal has gifts.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.741
And when I eat her whole,

19:21.766 --> 19:25.794
I will absorb her power
and use it as I wish.

19:35.331 --> 19:38.593
Why can't I... move you?

19:38.995 --> 19:43.052
Because I am not
of this reality, child!

19:43.558 --> 19:44.741
April!

19:45.074 --> 19:48.044
We have to retreat.
Let's go! Mikey!

19:48.069 --> 19:49.989
Booyakabunga!

20:03.160 --> 20:06.128
Stop! You will pursue no further.

20:06.129 --> 20:08.021
You will not leave my sight.

20:09.132 --> 20:12.398
As you command, Master.

20:14.902 --> 20:17.440
You have proven your usefulness.

20:25.716 --> 20:29.606
Oh, man. Kavaxas is even
tougher than Super Shredder.

20:29.966 --> 20:32.320
We could barely take down
three Cultists.

20:32.321 --> 20:36.691
How are we gonna take down an army
plus Tiger Claw and Hot Head too?

20:36.692 --> 20:37.947
What now, Leo?

20:39.430 --> 20:41.530
Well, at least we know
where their lair is.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.332
We just need a new plan of attack.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.101
Donnie, we need an upgrade.

20:45.102 --> 20:49.030
Can we get our hands on like,
say, two or three dozen tanks?

20:50.219 --> 20:53.582
April, is this Kavaxas
the new leader of The Foot?

20:53.605 --> 20:55.348
I don't think so.

20:55.446 --> 20:57.546
I did sense that Tiger Claw
summoned him

20:57.547 --> 20:59.414
because he's crucial to his plans,

20:59.415 --> 21:02.360
whatever they are.
That's all I could get.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.904
I wonder what they're really up to.

21:06.116 --> 21:09.622
I call upon the power
of the Seal of the Ancients

21:09.647 --> 21:12.066
to bind you to my purpose.

21:12.528 --> 21:15.864
By the spirits of all Demodragons past,

21:15.865 --> 21:17.718
you have my will.

21:17.867 --> 21:19.364
Is it true?

21:19.470 --> 21:23.529
Only you have the power to
manifest my wish, do you not?

21:23.797 --> 21:26.075
Indeed, Master Tiger Claw.

21:26.076 --> 21:30.605
I have that power...
and so much more.

21:30.848 --> 21:34.150
Then you must do it.
No matter what it takes.

21:34.151 --> 21:36.486
No matter who stands in your way.

21:36.487 --> 21:41.342
You will bring the Shredder
back from the dead!
