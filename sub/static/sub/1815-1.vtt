01:11.293 --> 01:13.400
- Hurry them up!
- Let's go, guys!

01:36.460 --> 01:39.480
- Where you from?
- Seattle, Washington.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.240
Bloomington. Indiana, sir.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.760
Why'd you join the USDF?

02:02.260 --> 02:04.140
There's fuck to do in Salton Sea.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.200
Did you have any idea what
we were headed into?

02:18.340 --> 02:18.940
No.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.860
If you had, would you still have gone?

02:46.060 --> 02:49.200
We're coming in!
Let's go, guys!

03:06.260 --> 03:08.980
What will you do when your
tour here is complete?

03:09.960 --> 03:12.020
I don't know.
I try not to think that far ahead

03:13.840 --> 03:16.920
Friendlies!
Regroup!

03:23.040 --> 03:25.240
We have a hell of a way to drive! 
Load up!

03:28.760 --> 03:30.040
Watch your heads!

03:31.160 --> 03:31.900
Come on!

03:36.340 --> 03:38.400
Have you ever seen a Heavy in person?

03:38.760 --> 03:39.960
Yeah.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.801
Yeah. I saw one walking down
my street when I was a kid

03:44.680 --> 03:46.540
I've been seeing that fucker 
every night since

03:49.760 --> 03:52.500
RPG on the ridge! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
- Finally!

03:53.720 --> 03:56.460
Ah! Come on! Get some!

03:56.580 --> 03:59.200
He'll fit in nicely at 37.
- Get some! Ba-boosh!

03:59.720 --> 04:01.360
Come on!
- What makes you say that?

04:01.880 --> 04:03.900
They're all out of their goddamn minds

04:04.140 --> 04:06.100
Yeah! ah!

04:06.300 --> 04:07.580
What do you miss most from home?

04:09.220 --> 04:10.220
Home-cooked meals.

04:11.700 --> 04:12.460
Whose cooking?

04:13.780 --> 04:14.580
My mom.

04:22.140 --> 04:24.120
<i>Vic, this is actual.
What's your status?</i>

04:24.460 --> 04:26.240
Taking the greens to 37.

04:26.340 --> 04:28.920
<i>Be advised we have enemy
contact to the south.</i>

04:29.260 --> 04:30.920
<i>Drop the greens. Return to Mako.</i>

04:31.540 --> 04:32.300
Get out.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.880
What are you talking about?
Where are we?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.600
Do you have a map?
- Yeah.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.400
- Get out.
- Go.

04:43.980 --> 04:46.100
Hurry up! It's getting dark!

04:55.600 --> 04:58.340
I was away at school during the invasion.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.840
And, um, my home got hit.

05:02.340 --> 05:05.540
And so I didn't have anywhere to go back to.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.560
What are we supposed to do now?

05:11.560 --> 05:12.980
Frankie, fall in.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.900
Andros, let me see the map.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.900
You thinking twice about signing up?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.200
- No, sir.
- Good. Take point.

05:33.980 --> 05:35.060
There was action here.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.680
Yeah. Recently.

05:39.320 --> 05:44.620
- How recent? 
- Doesn't matter. Let's go. Eyes up.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.920
You got to be fucking kidding me.

06:14.100 --> 06:17.120
And when you saw the outpost,
what were your first thoughts?

06:18.140 --> 06:21.680
That we should turn around,
try and make it back to Mako on foot

06:22.640 --> 06:24.460
Regardless of the punishment.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.960
Fuck. You think they got hit?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.620
I got a bad fucking feeling
about this, man.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.680
Doesn't matter.
We can't stay here.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.940
Let's go.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.560
Frankie!

06:53.300 --> 06:55.960
O.P. 37, this is specialist
Omohundro, over.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.820
Is there anything on the walkie?

06:59.900 --> 07:00.760
Shut up.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.720
O.P. 37, this is specialist
Omohundro, over.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.680
- I don't know what's up.
- Then why the fuck are we going in?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.260
It's the only place we can go

07:12.280 --> 07:15.420
Okay, here's the gate.
Andros, you blow the lock.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.560
I'm gonna go west.
Andros, you take east.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.420
Frankie, cover us with reds.
Expect Heavies.

07:20.780 --> 07:22.360
Set?
- Set.

07:23.920 --> 07:24.660
Fuck!

07:25.480 --> 07:27.800
It's one of ours!
Let's get in there!

07:31.860 --> 07:34.140
Watch out for friendlies.

07:34.260 --> 07:36.580
Muzzle discipline, clean shots
only, conserve ammo.

07:36.820 --> 07:37.500
Set?

07:37.600 --> 07:38.820
- Set?
- Set.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.040
Go!

07:40.860 --> 07:42.960
Fuck you, 
you bastards!

07:43.620 --> 07:45.640
I got you, 
you pieces of shit!

07:48.860 --> 07:49.640
Fuck you!

07:50.260 --> 07:52.040
Take that, 
you pricks!

07:52.540 --> 07:56.480
Piss off! Go back to your bloody
fucking home planet you fucks!

07:56.600 --> 08:00.400
- Friendlies at 7:00!
- Covering fire!

08:00.440 --> 08:02.300
Bloody hell!
Who the fuck are you, mate?

08:02.380 --> 08:03.700
Reinforcements.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.200
- Reloading!
- Get that saw back online!

08:07.280 --> 08:09.440
I got movement at 10:00!
Where the fuck are they?

08:09.580 --> 08:11.220
- I can't see shit!
- I'm out!

08:13.900 --> 08:15.880
Get that saw back online!

08:16.780 --> 08:19.580
What the fuck is going on?!
I don't know, mate, okay?

08:19.680 --> 08:23.000
These blokes arrived and began fucking shit
up, started shooting everything insight

08:23.120 --> 08:25.320
Drop your weapons!
Names now, shitheads!

08:25.680 --> 08:27.520
Sir, specialist
Alex Omohundro, sir.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.600
Do you have any idea what the
penalty is...

08:29.740 --> 08:31.620
for unauthorized entry to this outpost?!

08:32.020 --> 08:33.341
What the fuck are you looking at?

08:33.400 --> 08:35.640
- Grab those cameras!
- Give me the fucking camera!

08:41.539 --> 08:42.380
Hands up!

09:03.620 --> 09:05.400
What are you looking at, dick breath?!

09:08.780 --> 09:14.400
All right.
I can't do this anymore.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.340
See the look on their faces?
The little one shit himself.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.960
- Oh, dude, I smelled it.
- Sorry, guys. Sorry, guys.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.520
Just a little joke the men like
to play on the new arrivals.

09:22.540 --> 09:25.520
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Son, you're gonna live, okay?

09:26.300 --> 09:29.100
I'm Lieutenant Grant North.
Welcome to the 37, boys.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.160
- Where are you from?
- Sebring, Florida.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.860
Shitload of old people out there,
like the rest of Florida.

09:46.300 --> 09:47.340
Smells like oranges.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.920
I hate oranges. And what do you
miss most from home?

09:51.940 --> 09:54.860
How many women have you seen since
you've been here that weren't wearing a blanket

09:54.880 --> 09:56.080
None. Well, there you go.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.960
What will you do when your
tour here is complete?

10:00.000 --> 10:00.960
Going to Disneyland.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.180
Hey. The commander wants to see you.

10:07.840 --> 10:08.580
Okay.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.400
Holy shit, man.
Are these the new VL-624's?

10:13.560 --> 10:14.200
Yeah.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.720
We're gonna put them up around the base
wireless upload like our main cameras

10:17.800 --> 10:19.380
Low-profile.
U.H.D., right?

10:19.540 --> 10:20.080
Yeah.

10:21.560 --> 10:22.360
Uh, you mind?

10:24.300 --> 10:25.360
Uh... sure, okay.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.380
You might want to get moving.
Spears ain't patient.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.020
Hey.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.120
So, what's up?
I have no idea.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.180
I was unpacking, and Mac came and got me.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.540
Look at this place. Looks like he can
fight his own personal war.

10:43.540 --> 10:47.020
- What the fuck is this?
- A relic from the first invasion.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.000
First invasion?

10:49.320 --> 10:52.500
- There's only been one.
- There has only been one...

10:53.480 --> 10:55.120
- So far.
- Take a seat.

10:55.660 --> 10:58.400
You mind if we ask you some
questions about the FEW?

10:58.560 --> 11:02.060
Some other time. Right now, I need you
to understand the situation

11:03.300 --> 11:06.100
37's positioned in the most
dangerous part of the world.

11:06.420 --> 11:07.520
We're attacked here daily.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.677
Local resistance and
Heavy presence is higher

11:09.703 --> 11:11.625
here than any other
outpost on the planet.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.020
This isn't like any other outpost.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.660
When you're here, 
you fight.

11:22.580 --> 11:24.900
- Well, with all due respect, sir... 
- Keep your respect

11:26.260 --> 11:28.820
Save you asses.
Geneva doesn't exist out here.

11:29.060 --> 11:31.220
When you're within these walls,
you're a combatant.

11:31.340 --> 11:34.820
I refuse to lose one man because
you weren't armed. Do I make myself clear?

11:35.860 --> 11:37.661
Sir, we're...
- I said, do I make myself clear?

11:37.860 --> 11:40.500
Sir, we're journalists, 
not soldiers.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.660
Everyone became a soldier 10 years ago,
whether they liked it or not.

11:44.220 --> 11:46.000
Now take your weapons.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.500
That'll be all.

11:57.620 --> 12:00.620
Yeah, I got goat coming out
of my fucking ears.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.600
Which one of you hicks shot this one, huh?

12:03.680 --> 12:05.280
Yeah, couldn't you shoot
something that tastes good?

12:05.500 --> 12:07.741
Hey, man, I ain't never seen
you pass up a meal, fat boy.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.080
Whites only.

12:10.540 --> 12:12.940
Omohundro, hey, you did good yesterday.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.660
This is for you.
Look how he's eyeing him.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.620
That ain't Omo. That's "Homo."

12:17.740 --> 12:21.100
Aw, I think Bones is jealous.
Aren't you, Bones?

12:21.220 --> 12:24.060
Hey, man, keep your hands off my shrimp
and your eyes off my barbie huh?

12:24.380 --> 12:26.377
Bones, if you could fight
half as well as you

12:26.403 --> 12:28.485
talk, this war would have
been over years ago.

12:38.980 --> 12:40.720
Where were you during the invasion?

12:41.260 --> 12:43.220
Man, I was held up with my boys in A-T-L.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.140
I was hoping that they would run
up on our street.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.320
You think the Heavies will
attempt another invasion?

12:47.602 --> 12:49.614
No, man, they can't get past
the seraphs.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.520
- seraphs?
- Orbital defense sentries.

13:07.922 --> 13:12.477
My, um... my squad was
stationed in North Korea before the attack

13:12.833 --> 13:15.877
rebuilding, securing the new
government, that sort of thing.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.833
And, uh, Spears was my C.O.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.077
Anyways, I remember I was in

13:22.322 --> 13:24.966
Um... I was in New Pyong when
the... the news came on.

13:25.922 --> 13:29.566
It said that there'd been some
natural disaster, some shit,

13:29.766 --> 13:31.700
Brazil, in Port Velho.

13:34.233 --> 13:37.366
And this was June 13th, 
2021?

13:39.960 --> 13:42.766
I mean, there wasn't
much coming out at first.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.788
You know, other than Velho
was apparently destroyed

13:45.922 --> 13:49.188
but about a day later, more
reports started coming in...

13:50.677 --> 13:52.966
more cities destroyed...

13:54.700 --> 13:58.411
Millions... millions dead.

14:02.211 --> 14:06.966
And then the real shit hit the fan
an invasion, aliens.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.211
It just... didn't seem real.

14:14.700 --> 14:18.366
Yeah, go. You're off.

14:18.633 --> 14:20.788
- What the hell?
- No, you're off, dude.

14:21.588 --> 14:23.455
Check your wind. It should be on 3.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.322
All right.
All right, watch it now.

14:31.411 --> 14:33.722
Very good.

14:38.833 --> 14:41.122
All right, big guy, one more step.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.855
There we go. And... there.

14:46.722 --> 14:49.655
What the fuck happened?
I can't feel my leg.

14:49.944 --> 14:52.188
I got bit by that thing,
and I can't feel my leg.

14:54.188 --> 14:57.322
It's a numb bug. Little fuckers
came down with the Heavies

14:57.611 --> 15:01.255
- That's what I told him.
- Is there something you can give me?

15:02.233 --> 15:03.744
I could piss on it for you.

15:04.255 --> 15:05.077
Yeah.

15:05.922 --> 15:07.433
- Will that help?
- No.

15:08.122 --> 15:09.966
But I can't feel my foot.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.140
Why do you think they call it
a "numb bug", numb nuts?

15:12.211 --> 15:14.144
Here. Get the fuck out of the way.

15:14.388 --> 15:21.255
It'll go away in a couple hours.
But you can go away now.

15:24.255 --> 15:26.744
Boys, that is a house that is full.

15:30.477 --> 15:34.344
I am foxtrot, uniform,
charlie, kilo, echo, delta.

15:36.522 --> 15:38.877
- What does that mean?
- He's "fucked".

15:40.144 --> 15:43.411
They said they took fire
almost every single day.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.766
So I knew it was gonna come
sooner or later.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.366
Were you ready for it when it came?

15:50.033 --> 15:50.944
Hell, yeah.

15:56.033 --> 15:58.188
Looks like that Joe has seen
a lot of action.

16:00.188 --> 16:03.255
Yeah, he has.
It's my son's.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.388
How old is he?

16:08.700 --> 16:11.322
Him and my wife were in
Chicago during the counteroffensive.

16:12.611 --> 16:15.766
- What, you were there?
- No.

16:16.766 --> 16:17.966
That's why I'm still alive.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.788
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

16:20.855 --> 16:25.900
Eyes up! Brick, get on that fucking 50!

16:28.188 --> 16:31.655
- Call in that air strike
- I'm already on it, sir!

16:37.166 --> 16:39.766
Get up on those escorts! Move!

16:43.700 --> 16:46.522
I got these guys to the east!

16:48.100 --> 16:52.900
- The LZ is full! -All right, got it!
You got grenades?

16:52.966 --> 16:54.255
- Yeah.
- Get them out.

16:55.522 --> 16:57.522
Get down! Get down!

16:57.655 --> 17:00.700
- From behind!
- Nice going, Harty!

17:02.722 --> 17:05.387
- Got two tangos getting close!
- Fuck you!

17:08.855 --> 17:11.877
Hold the wall!
There you go!

17:12.344 --> 17:17.833
- 200 yards!
- Come on, motherfucker!

17:17.900 --> 17:19.900
I see you, nigga!

17:23.387 --> 17:25.944
Yeah, boy! 
Fuck, yeah!

17:27.676 --> 17:30.033
Incoming!

17:30.566 --> 17:32.633
We got a man down!

17:32.988 --> 17:34.722
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.411
Now you're in the 37, man.

17:39.322 --> 17:41.388
Watch those fucks on the left!

17:42.900 --> 17:45.655
Medic!
 Wilks!

17:49.011 --> 17:50.522
 I got you.

17:51.566 --> 17:53.077
You're all right.
Don't touch it.

17:53.188 --> 17:56.255
Just lay back.
Got that camera, Omo.

17:56.322 --> 17:58.988
Mortar!
Incoming Mortar!

18:00.500 --> 18:02.500
I need to look at this.
Here we go. All right

18:02.722 --> 18:04.055
- Stay.
- Zilla!

18:04.070 --> 18:06.633
- Straight.
- Zilla!

18:06.744 --> 18:08.544
- Zilla!
- I need you.

18:11.055 --> 18:13.544
RADIO: <i>Outpost 37, actual, this is Dirty Bird.</i>

18:13.566 --> 18:15.722
<i>We are standing by for paint-on target.</i>

18:16.566 --> 18:19.655
Zilla, put the rim down!
Spot that target!

18:19.744 --> 18:20.722
Copy that, sir!

18:31.144 --> 18:32.633
- You good?
- Yes, sir.

18:32.766 --> 18:34.922
Get that scope back up!
Let's go!

18:35.722 --> 18:39.500
Hey, look at them run.
Hey, look at them run.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.322
Y'all see that shit?!

18:51.611 --> 18:53.655
Smile for the camera, Brick.

18:55.611 --> 18:56.855
Now you're in.

18:57.966 --> 19:01.522
Frankie, that's 37 for you,
baby, that's 37.

19:02.300 --> 19:03.922
Why did the locals attack the base?

19:04.500 --> 19:07.701
I thought the inter-human conflict ended
in this region after the Heavies invaded.

19:07.788 --> 19:08.433
It did.

19:09.988 --> 19:14.966
But, you know, post-invasion, we needed
to ensure the safety of humanity

19:15.477 --> 19:16.922
So the outposts were commissioned.

19:18.077 --> 19:20.211
Unfortunately, we encroached on
their sovereignty.

19:22.055 --> 19:25.611
Well, for a decade, they put up
with it, but, um,

19:26.500 --> 19:28.220
But, um, patience must
be wearing thin, huh?

19:28.322 --> 19:30.522
Look at me. look at me, Duke.
Squeeze my hand.

19:30.633 --> 19:32.011
Okay.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.677
- Hold on.
- Fuck!

19:33.922 --> 19:37.344
I can't get it, not here, 
not like this.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.611
Take it out. Take it out.

19:39.811 --> 19:41.477
Duke. Relax.

19:41.544 --> 19:42.700
Relax. You'll die.

19:44.611 --> 19:47.633
You did good.
All right, take him out.

19:47.811 --> 19:48.522
Yes, sir.

19:50.077 --> 19:52.966
- Hey.
- Set, boys?

19:53.411 --> 19:55.166
Move fast. Get him to that base.

19:55.522 --> 19:56.966
Don't come back till daylight.

19:57.211 --> 19:59.731
Listen, you're gonna be two men down.
What if they attack again?

19:59.833 --> 20:01.544
Don't worry about that.
They won't.

20:01.877 --> 20:03.655
You just see to Duke, okay?

20:03.988 --> 20:07.300
Three, down. And bring back supplies.
We need all the ammo they can give us.

20:08.411 --> 20:10.011
- Good.
- Be safe.

20:10.922 --> 20:12.077
You, too, brother.

20:12.255 --> 20:14.011
You're gonna be all right, Duke.

20:14.166 --> 20:16.033
- Duke.
- Nice work, fellas.

20:29.800 --> 20:35.460
Uh, geographically, uh, we're in the
DMZ between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

20:35.860 --> 20:39.120
It's an area that was largely
controlled by these local tribes.

20:40.380 --> 20:42.580
And the Heavies
retreated here after the invasion.

20:43.900 --> 20:44.840
And we followed.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.260
So, he's gonna be okay.

21:04.740 --> 21:07.720
But he's done here.
They're sending him to Lyon to cover.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.180
Motherfuck.

21:13.300 --> 21:14.600
Listen, guys.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.140
You did well.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.320
And Duke got hit doing his job.
That's all.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.620
Do this long enough, we all get hit.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.560
So let's get back to it.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.700
I want patrols around the base all day.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.059
Zilla, it's your turn.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.699
Take the rooks.
Get rid of the bodies.

21:35.700 --> 21:36.439
Sir.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.600
The rest of you, that's all.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.520
That's the worst we've ever
seen from the locals.

21:43.780 --> 21:47.280
They're gearing up for something.
Might try to finally push us out

21:49.760 --> 21:51.400
They can't take on the
Heavies without us.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.259
We need more men.

21:53.260 --> 21:55.160
We won't get them.
I put a request in this morning.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.359
The answer was negative.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.280
Fuck.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.320
So, what do you want to do?

22:07.920 --> 22:09.640
Tell Mac to bring Saleem in.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.979
Let's see what he knows.

22:11.980 --> 22:15.139
Back in the initial fighting
of the FEW, our ground troops

22:15.140 --> 22:17.312
They struggled to kill...
hell, even injure...

22:17.338 --> 22:20.180
the Heavies. They're
big fuckers, huge.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.120
They got a thick armor, too

22:23.400 --> 22:25.360
Made from some metal we don't
have here on earth.

22:26.380 --> 22:29.220
Makes them slow, but they're
still walking tanks.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.760
So, our weapons weren't effective?

22:32.120 --> 22:33.400
You could barely bring one down.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.980
Finally, Darpa got their
hands on a couple of

22:36.006 --> 22:38.025
dead ones and researched
a new type of round.

22:39.020 --> 22:43.020
HIPRS, high impact
phosphorous rounds... "Reds"

22:43.660 --> 22:45.980
It's like having, uh, 10 bullets in one.

22:46.920 --> 22:47.940
Say you fire one, right?

22:48.340 --> 22:50.640
The bullet flies, hits
the target, explodes,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.060
Fires another bullet, like those,
uh... those Russian cup things.

22:54.580 --> 22:57.440
Tears through the armor and
fills them with a burning phosphorous.

22:58.490 --> 22:59.420
Nasty.

23:15.300 --> 23:16.300
Smelling shit.

23:18.620 --> 23:20.100
Dude, you're a pervert.
You know that?

23:21.860 --> 23:23.380
Oh, damn!

23:25.320 --> 23:27.420
God, I almost feel guilty about this.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.819
Look at this.
Surgical hands, baby,

23:29.820 --> 23:31.319
Surgical hands. Look at that.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.840
Just gonna give her a little face-lift.

23:37.860 --> 23:38.840
I'm wiped.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.400
Burn what we got so far and
take five.

23:51.380 --> 23:52.600
They're finished marinating.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.080
Any of you guys got a light?

24:02.220 --> 24:03.540
You close to Duke?

24:04.860 --> 24:07.500
Yeah. He's a good soldier.

24:10.300 --> 24:13.360
I bet you he pulled so much
wool with that damn Aussie accent.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.880
Frankie, maybe that's what you should do.

24:17.060 --> 24:18.399
You should fake an accent.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.001
Then you can finally get a piece of ass.

24:20.740 --> 24:21.900
I've had plenty.

24:22.179 --> 24:24.579
Oh, is that why you look at
that picture of your mom so much?

24:24.580 --> 24:26.010
Seriously, Frankie.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.660
Is that the last pussy you've seen?

24:31.620 --> 24:33.901
All right, come on, Frankie.
Let's see the photo. Com'on.

24:41.700 --> 24:44.100
Bones tells me she's got
a great spread, Frankie.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.420
Yo, he's gonna be crazy.

24:54.080 --> 24:54.880
Oh, shit.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.139
Come on! Come on!

24:57.140 --> 25:00.380
Step up and see the beautiful...
and... hold up... sexy

25:01.120 --> 25:02.240
Miss Forello!

25:02.880 --> 25:04.340
What the fuck's going on?

25:04.620 --> 25:06.100
Frankie.

25:06.780 --> 25:08.579
Hey, no, come on, Frankie.

25:08.580 --> 25:09.539
Come on, Frankie.

25:09.540 --> 25:10.719
- Just give me the...
- No.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.059
- Just give me the photo.
- No, it looks good.

25:12.060 --> 25:13.040
Just give it back.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.499
It looks good.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.500
- Just give it...
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

25:17.060 --> 25:18.540
- Come on, Frankie.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.019
- Okay. okay.
- Come on, Frankie.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.199
- Okay.
- Come on, Frankie.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.039
Just give me the photo, man.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.560
- Frank, come on, man.
- That's my mom.

25:23.820 --> 25:24.900
Just ask nice.

25:25.470 --> 25:26.360
Please.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.840
He said "please"!

25:28.600 --> 25:30.019
Frankie, come on, man.

25:30.020 --> 25:31.539
Frankie, come on.
Frankie, come on.

25:31.540 --> 25:33.080
Oh, Frankie.

25:35.620 --> 25:38.520
When you're the new guy, you just
shut up and do what they tell you.

25:39.820 --> 25:42.000
They'd fuck with us constantly,
but...

25:42.340 --> 25:43.659
It's just part of the game.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.580
They... they want to see
who's gonna crack.

25:46.320 --> 25:49.460
- Are you gonna crack?
- No, sir.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.000
I got to last at least until
I prove them wrong.

25:53.830 --> 25:54.940
Prove who wrong?

25:56.520 --> 25:57.980
Everyone here and...

25:59.320 --> 26:00.340
back home.

26:02.200 --> 26:05.180
Come on, Frankie!
You can be the piggy in the middle!

26:05.640 --> 26:07.320
- No, man.
- You can go in the middle, man.

26:15.040 --> 26:15.940
Sir?

26:16.660 --> 26:17.480
What is it?

26:17.759 --> 26:19.479
Someone's approaching from
the west on foot.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.480
- How far out?
- Less than a kick out, sir.

26:22.020 --> 26:24.219
- All right, tell the twins.
- Already done, sir.

26:24.220 --> 26:25.820
Good job. Assemble the men.

26:44.220 --> 26:45.260
That's far enough.

26:46.660 --> 26:47.580
Captain!

26:51.260 --> 26:52.260
Lower your weapons.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.820
Alderich Heilbronner, USDF
replacement soldier, sir.

27:01.418 --> 27:03.019
That was faster than it
should have been.

27:03.020 --> 27:04.861
Duke got to the FOB less
than eight hours ago.

27:05.940 --> 27:07.700
Duke was stationed at Mako as a
USDF liaison.

27:08.980 --> 27:09.920
I volunteered.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.581
Now, why would you do that?

27:11.900 --> 27:13.580
Because I know what you face
out here, sir.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.600
You cannot be a man down.

27:20.540 --> 27:23.919
I respect what you're saying,
but I don't give a damn about the D.F

27:23.920 --> 27:24.740
You understand?

27:25.960 --> 27:28.540
I'm a soldier. I will fight and
die by your side, Commander.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.900
Welcome to 37.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.160
It is an honor, sir.

27:37.540 --> 27:40.280
The men seem like they'd follow
Spears into hell.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.220
Would you?

27:42.580 --> 27:43.960
You're damn right they would.

27:45.420 --> 27:46.580
And I have.

27:46.820 --> 27:49.160
And when the Heavies first
invaded, they, uh...

27:49.520 --> 27:52.800
dropped straight through the
atmosphere and landed hard.

27:54.160 --> 27:57.640
A few days later, they launched
a worldwide attack.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.840
It was every country for themselves.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.540
It was complete fucking chaos.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.799
Then things got better when the
U.N. was disbanded and the USDF form

28:08.800 --> 28:10.440
The United Space Defense Force?

28:10.920 --> 28:11.740
Yeah!

28:12.860 --> 28:15.380
Spears volunteered to lead a,
uh, counteroffensive and

28:16.440 --> 28:17.740
brought me along for the ride.

28:18.810 --> 28:20.280
After a couple of months, we, uh...

28:21.500 --> 28:22.860
we started pushing them back.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.300
They'd spread themselves too thin.

28:26.900 --> 28:30.460
Well, that and our air force was
kicking the shit out of theirs.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.219
We hit their mothership so fucking hard

28:35.220 --> 28:37.040
They couldn't wait to get the hell out.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.680
And the world celebrated, but

28:42.260 --> 28:44.700
There we still thousands of
Heavies left behind.

28:44.940 --> 28:48.480
Which brings us to the
creation of the outposts.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.480
Exactly.

28:51.660 --> 28:54.920
- Hey, Frankie.
- Evening, sir.

28:58.140 --> 28:59.380
Busy tonight, huh?

29:00.620 --> 29:01.640
Yeah.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.760
Listen, I hear the boys have
been giving you a bit of a hard time.

29:16.680 --> 29:19.360
It's just their way of
finding out who you are.

29:21.140 --> 29:22.820
You're the new guy on the base.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.780
They want to see what you can
take.

29:27.780 --> 29:29.360
I promise you this...

29:30.150 --> 29:31.840
If you can shoulder up to it.

29:32.950 --> 29:34.540
Show them you can take it.

29:34.715 --> 29:35.955
Each and every one of these men

29:35.980 --> 29:38.460
will have your back every day
of the week and twice on Sundays.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.700
Frankie, you got this!

29:45.540 --> 29:46.980
It's all you, little man!

29:48.340 --> 29:49.299
Let's go!

29:49.300 --> 29:50.699
Go low!
Come on!

29:50.700 --> 29:52.079
Go low!
Oh!

29:52.080 --> 29:53.879
There it is!
Come on, Frankie!

29:53.880 --> 29:55.639
Let's go, buddy.
Come on, Frankie.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.400
We got money on you here.
Oh!

29:57.580 --> 29:58.980
Yes.

30:02.740 --> 30:03.840
Where are you from?

30:04.380 --> 30:05.980
The New Republic of Biafra.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.940
Why did you join the USDF?

30:09.100 --> 30:12.960
I was an RNB resistance
fighter way before the invasion.

30:13.660 --> 30:16.420
Seemed like another cause that
needed someone like me.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.939
- Hey, Saleem.
- How's it going?

30:21.940 --> 30:24.179
- Everyone's waiting for you.
- It's okay.

30:24.180 --> 30:26.939
- How are you, my brother?
- Hey, North.

30:26.940 --> 30:29.360
- So good to see you, my friend.
- Spears wants to see you.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.160
There's been some strange
activity that's been happening.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.560
Saleem's our Pakistani translator.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.820
He's a... He's a good guy.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.840
He loves us, man.
He loves Americans, you know?

30:42.400 --> 30:47.480
Um, post invasion, the Heavies,
uh, raided his village, killed his family.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.780
They captured him, you know,
P.O.W.-like.

30:50.740 --> 30:54.000
Then a group of American's came
through and saved him, you know?

30:54.260 --> 30:57.020
Since then, he'd pretty much do
anything for us.

30:58.140 --> 30:59.300
All right, men, listen up.

30:59.798 --> 31:02.519
You're gonna follow Saleem back
down to... what's that place called?

31:02.520 --> 31:03.320
Ghrem.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.559
Yeah, Ghrem, to deal with the elders.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.859
Some of the goats were killed last night.

31:06.860 --> 31:08.300
They think it was one of our
mortars.

31:08.420 --> 31:12.940
We can't afford to have a revolt,
not now, not after the recent attack.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.940
North is gonna lead you down.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.580
All right, let's go.
Stay alert.

31:21.020 --> 31:22.160
- Handle it.
- Sir.

31:23.760 --> 31:24.720
Sergeant Wilks?

31:25.160 --> 31:26.099
Follow me, boys.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.960
Have you ever seen a Heavy in
person?

31:29.700 --> 31:34.420
I've done the training, I've
been in the simulators, but no,

31:35.320 --> 31:37.500
no face-to-face contact.

31:38.880 --> 31:39.380
====

31:49.100 --> 31:51.060
Why do you guys strap your
weapons down like that?

31:52.420 --> 31:55.540
Oh, so the Heavies and the
Hajis don't take them.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.759
Why would a Heavy want an M4?

31:57.760 --> 31:58.980
I mean, they've got lasers.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.620
Yeah, they got them.
They just can't use them.

32:02.140 --> 32:03.700
Most of them are out of ammo.

32:05.360 --> 32:08.400
We'd be Heavy slaves or worse if
they'd had enough during the war.

32:21.420 --> 32:22.580
You go and speak to him.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.560
Salaam.

32:41.710 --> 32:45.440
He says we owe him 12 goats.
His wife and child have nothing.

32:45.810 --> 32:49.640
- This was all that they had. - Well, you
tell him sorry, but we didn't do this.

32:50.460 --> 32:52.260
Everyone, eyes up.
Omo, with me.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.760
Copy, sir.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.799
Fuck.

33:09.800 --> 33:10.740
What is it?

33:11.100 --> 33:13.980
No human did this.
Possible Heavies in the area!

33:19.260 --> 33:20.160
Contact, 12:00!

33:20.520 --> 33:22.920
Hold your fire!
Saleem, tell him to stop.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.299
Saleem, tell him to stop.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.940
Hold your goddamn fire, Hans!

33:29.180 --> 33:31.420
Everybody, spread out!
Tell him to stop!

33:32.920 --> 33:34.280
This is his last warning,
Saleem!

33:34.630 --> 33:37.140
He won't listen to me.
He doesn't look right, sir.

33:39.140 --> 33:40.200
Oh, thank god.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.380
God damn!
Shit!

33:53.300 --> 33:54.600
Everybody, sound off!

33:54.780 --> 33:56.699
Tentuglo, sir!
Team three good!

33:56.700 --> 33:57.980
Saleem, you okay?

34:00.720 --> 34:02.760
- Oh, shit!
- Heavies!

34:03.120 --> 34:05.260
Take cover!
Go! go! go! go!

34:09.560 --> 34:12.259
Move! Everybody up!
Let's go! Let's go!

34:12.260 --> 34:15.380
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!
Come on! Go!

34:23.780 --> 34:25.379
Everybody, Reds now!

34:25.380 --> 34:28.359
Reds in!
Come on! Light up the ridge!

34:28.360 --> 34:30.460
We got another one at 3:00!

34:33.139 --> 34:35.659
Now fall back!
Make our way back to the outpost.

34:35.659 --> 34:37.400
Everybody, go!

34:37.980 --> 34:39.759
Fall back! God damn it!

34:39.760 --> 34:41.239
Fall back and regroup!

34:41.699 --> 34:43.040
Move! Move! Move!

34:44.219 --> 34:46.339
Get out of here!
I got you, Frankie!

34:46.340 --> 34:47.739
Get behind me.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.599
Come on! 
Move! Move! Move!

34:50.600 --> 34:52.099
Buddy, out of the way!

34:52.100 --> 34:53.659
Okay, let's go! let's go!

34:53.659 --> 34:54.520
Move! Move! Move!

34:54.820 --> 34:56.100
Go! Go! Go!

34:58.380 --> 35:04.459
People Forget, or...
at least, they choose to forget

35:04.460 --> 35:06.120
as a way to survive.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.720
That's something that
I haven't been able to do.

35:11.060 --> 35:13.720
I've never heard of Heavies
planning an ambush before.

35:15.300 --> 35:18.680
- Me neither. 
- Where is North?

35:20.380 --> 35:22.240
- Where is North? 
- Lieutenant North!

35:22.530 --> 35:25.399
- Lieutenant North? 
- We're going back.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.919
- Andros, come on. 
- Omo, on me.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.700
Let's go, boys. 
Move!

35:33.700 --> 35:35.700
He pushed me away right here.

35:38.220 --> 35:39.440
North?

35:41.160 --> 35:42.060
North?

35:44.120 --> 35:46.800
Let's go. Frankie, cover my 6:00.

35:49.020 --> 35:50.760
God damn it, Grant. 
Where are you?

35:56.760 --> 36:00.240
Over here! Is that his helmet?

36:11.860 --> 36:13.080
Oh, god.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.680
I'm headed to Mako.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.320
General Dane needs to see this in person.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.120
I'm leaving you with operational command.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.819
- What are my orders, captain?
- Fortify the base.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.380
Nobody leaves under any circumstances.
Understood?

36:40.960 --> 36:41.920
Sir.

36:53.700 --> 36:54.940
Fucking Germans, right?

36:58.220 --> 37:00.900
I thought that Brick said
that they were out of ammo.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.560
They don't have more...

37:04.000 --> 37:05.160
just what's left.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.660
Which isn't much.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.520
It doesn't take much.

37:09.980 --> 37:11.660
Yeah, well, I don't know, man.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.880
I mean, how we supposed to fight
that shit?

37:15.300 --> 37:17.540
Well, Dude, that's what
we got Reds for, right?

37:20.800 --> 37:22.700
It was low after they got North.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.740
And then the PMCS came in, and

37:25.780 --> 37:27.260
We fucking lost it.

37:27.660 --> 37:29.580
Why did the PMCS show up?

37:29.940 --> 37:30.840
Politics.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.400
Who the fuck are you?

37:34.930 --> 37:38.319
We're contractors sent by the
USDF to investigate last night's encounter.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.119
What encounter?

37:39.120 --> 37:42.020
Your orders are to stay at base.
Do not interfere.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.100
Get off my base...
 now.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.100
You will comply or face court-martial.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.280
We have jurisdiction here.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.840
Take your men back inside.

37:58.380 --> 37:59.900
Who has jurisdiction, 
dickhead?

38:08.400 --> 38:10.960
Like I said... nwe do.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.760
Mac, get on the horn with Mako, find out
what the fuck is going on here.

38:14.820 --> 38:16.000
Copy that, sir.

38:20.720 --> 38:24.000
Uh, sir, our orders are to stand down.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.800
I don't know why the fuck
they brought them in.

38:38.260 --> 38:40.420
Oh, where the fuck is Spears?

38:41.160 --> 38:42.319
I don't know.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.020
Haven't been able to raise him
on the comms all day.

38:45.640 --> 38:48.180
We can't even search for North proper.

38:50.390 --> 38:52.940
What if we use the drone?

38:54.470 --> 38:57.170
Oh, you're a goddamn genius.

39:04.110 --> 39:05.920
Yo, it's too dark, Mac.

39:07.070 --> 39:10.710
I thought all you brothers liked the dark.
Eyes and teeth, right?

39:11.190 --> 39:12.800
Yo, cut it, Harty.

39:15.370 --> 39:19.270
Hang on.
Is that the PMCS?

39:19.350 --> 39:22.320
What are those fuckers doing past the NCZ?

39:22.610 --> 39:24.280
Where the fuck are they?

39:25.420 --> 39:28.110
Now I got to head back, man.
My battery's dying.

39:28.140 --> 39:30.490
Y'all tell Andros to go play catch.

39:32.290 --> 39:35.470
Andros, we got the U.A.V.
Headed back in your direction.

39:36.650 --> 39:38.040
Oh, shit. A Heavy.

39:38.390 --> 39:41.800
- Wait. Who's that?
- It's Saleem.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.440
We got a Heavy chasing Saleem!

39:44.500 --> 39:47.340
Hans, support! 
Brick, on Omo!

39:47.350 --> 39:52.670
Frankie, stay here! Let's go! Let's
move it! Let's go! Come on! Let's go!

39:53.070 --> 39:56.450
I'm arming the drone.
Hurry up. It's almost on him.

39:57.230 --> 40:00.330
Come on! Close it up!
Everybody in!

40:00.570 --> 40:04.950
- <i>What's your status, Mac?</i>
- I can't get it. The target won't lock.

40:05.230 --> 40:07.260
I'm going up!

40:09.050 --> 40:11.080
I can't get the shot!

40:12.120 --> 40:14.710
- <i>Mac, I can't get the shot.</i>
- Come on, motherfucker, lock!

40:14.720 --> 40:17.030
- <i>Mac!</i>
- Come on!

40:18.190 --> 40:20.090
What the fucking shit?

40:40.870 --> 40:42.330
Strap it up.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.030
I had never been more scared
in my entire life.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.420
When we brought that
thing back to the base.

41:00.110 --> 41:01.940
Think it knows where North is?

41:03.320 --> 41:05.890
- Bet your ass it does.
- Can't we wake it up

41:05.990 --> 41:09.180
- And make it tell us?
- No.

41:16.430 --> 41:17.580
What the fuck are you doing?

41:17.710 --> 41:21.100
- I told you not to go off this base!
- Sir.

41:22.940 --> 41:25.260
This is my responsibility.

41:25.770 --> 41:28.760
It was chasing Saleem, and we
had to go after him.

41:30.130 --> 41:33.010
All right, everyone out.
Omo and Wilks, stay here.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.010
All right, what's going on?

41:39.170 --> 41:40.580
Captain, we thought we could
extract North...

41:40.590 --> 41:42.080
Your job, sergeant, is not to think!

41:42.110 --> 41:45.720
Your job is to obey orders!
Do you understand that?!

41:45.790 --> 41:48.490
Yes, sir, but shouldn't we at least try to... 
- Try to what?!

42:01.890 --> 42:03.780
Sir, what do we do?

42:05.350 --> 42:06.640
We do nothing.

42:07.260 --> 42:10.990
Captain, North may be in the hands of...
- I said we do nothing

42:11.130 --> 42:15.710
because those are our orders.
We don't know if North is dead or alive.

42:15.930 --> 42:20.090
And I won't compromise this base,
this mission, or my men for anyone.

42:20.140 --> 42:23.280
This operation is bigger than
any one of us, myself included.

42:23.340 --> 42:28.270
And when I tell you to obey an order,
you obey that goddamn order.

42:28.300 --> 42:30.280
Do you understand, sergeant?!

42:31.990 --> 42:34.240
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

42:34.470 --> 42:35.650
Sir.

42:41.460 --> 42:44.380
- You sure you want to do this?
- I am sure.

42:45.310 --> 42:48.350
- You know we can't support you.
- I know.

42:49.600 --> 42:53.080
If you find North, come straight back.
Don't try and rescue him.

42:53.470 --> 42:55.540
Just get the coordinates
and bring them back.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.410
Today I'm alive because of you.

43:00.040 --> 43:03.730
Insha'allah, 
I may repay that debt.

43:09.030 --> 43:11.020
Why did you join the USDF?

43:11.630 --> 43:17.280
My dad gave my brother and I
two options... military or law.

43:17.530 --> 43:20.980
My twin took the better option.

43:32.990 --> 43:35.510
I'm gonna go out on a limb
here and assume...

43:36.310 --> 43:38.750
that you guys aren't really twins.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.810
Your turn, man.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.100
All right.

43:45.030 --> 43:48.070
We both enlisted at Chapsworth
the same year,

43:48.460 --> 43:50.960
and we both have the same last...
it's a military academy.

43:51.510 --> 43:52.630
Right.

43:53.120 --> 43:56.690
And we both have the same
last name... Dotson.

43:57.670 --> 44:02.340
Anyway, we came up through the cal
program together. Cal's a sniper program.

44:02.740 --> 44:06.580
Man, you always leave this shit out like
people know what you're talking about.

44:06.720 --> 44:10.910
Whatever. Look,
we was both trained in prewar.

44:11.240 --> 44:13.310
The academy is in South Carolina.

44:13.360 --> 44:17.410
An impact zone.
Luckily, it wasn't leveled when they hit.

44:18.510 --> 44:21.290
Didn't take long before we spot
them on the ground.

44:21.490 --> 44:22.600
Heavies?

44:22.900 --> 44:24.150
Oh, yeah.

44:24.830 --> 44:26.920
He and I were up in the watchtowers.

44:27.500 --> 44:30.290
Held them off long enough for
the army to come in and provide support.

44:30.390 --> 44:32.160
I got another goat here.

44:32.760 --> 44:39.120
So, yeah, twin guard towers,
twin snipers, same last name.

44:39.370 --> 44:41.620
The twins.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.410
I'm gonna take this shot.

44:44.430 --> 44:48.230
Harty's cooking is slightly less
horrible when there's meat involved.

44:55.810 --> 44:59.920
- Yo, come on, man.
- What, you got somewhere to be?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.460
Man, why you always scared of everything?

45:03.960 --> 45:07.370
- I'm not scared.
- Man, you is scared.

45:07.560 --> 45:09.775
You scared of boo. You
scared that there

45:09.801 --> 45:12.285
hasn't been any contact
in the past few days.

45:12.550 --> 45:15.950
- You is scared.
- It's strange.

45:15.980 --> 45:18.360
I'm not scared.

45:18.900 --> 45:22.240
Just strange.
He's definitely scared.

45:23.430 --> 45:25.110
Hey, what you got there?

45:25.810 --> 45:27.140
It's bourbon.

45:30.180 --> 45:32.160
That's my SWO milk, man.

45:32.230 --> 45:35.350
- What is SWO milk?
- It's a protein shake, fool.

45:35.550 --> 45:39.190
Damn. German bourbon better than homo milk.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.360
Get out of here with your kraut bigot ass.

45:41.450 --> 45:44.600
Got more protein between my balls
than your fucking shake.

45:46.800 --> 45:50.700
- He caught you right...
- That ain't funny, Hans!

45:50.720 --> 45:52.470
Where were you during the FEW?

45:52.560 --> 45:54.950
I was in Munich. Berlin was hit.

45:55.670 --> 45:59.080
My father and I traveled as quickly as
we could to aide with the resistance.

45:59.150 --> 46:01.430
Do you think the Heavies will
attempt another invasion?

46:01.540 --> 46:04.740
Yeah, my father and I both
believe they will.

46:05.160 --> 46:08.060
He regrets he can no longer
stand to meet the invaders.

46:08.420 --> 46:10.010
But that is why he sent me out.

46:15.650 --> 46:17.080
Yo, Fingers?

46:19.430 --> 46:20.600
Frankie?

46:22.720 --> 46:26.460
- Fingers!
- What the hell?

46:26.910 --> 46:29.080
It's your shift, man.

46:50.820 --> 46:52.470
Oh, shit, it's Saleem.

46:56.830 --> 46:59.400
Got Saleem approaching gate.

47:02.540 --> 47:04.070
Hey, Bones, you see him?

47:04.270 --> 47:06.060
Yeah, he's about a minute out.

47:09.940 --> 47:11.730
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

47:12.420 --> 47:13.470
Thanks.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.760
- Ah, it's good.
- Yeah, it is.

47:24.610 --> 47:26.730
For those of you who'd like
to hear what Saleem found,

47:26.770 --> 47:28.300
He'll be here in two minutes.

47:28.310 --> 47:31.070
Mac to Frankie.
Why ain't you at the terminal, man?

47:31.100 --> 47:33.300
Just came to let the guys
know that Saleem was here.

47:33.490 --> 47:34.630
You want me to come back?

47:34.680 --> 47:36.590
Not now. I got it.

47:36.640 --> 47:39.170
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

47:40.480 --> 47:41.930
Here we go.

47:43.790 --> 47:45.560
All right.

47:45.670 --> 47:48.160
New orders, Saleem... got to
search everybody.

47:48.170 --> 47:51.310
Yo, Frankie, step back.
Hands up.

47:54.920 --> 47:56.810
Hey, arms to your sides, Saleem.
Come on.

48:03.540 --> 48:05.210
What the fuck?

48:10.450 --> 48:14.110
- All right, all clear.
- Frankie, something's off.

48:14.119 --> 48:15.159
Hey, man, what'd you find?

48:15.160 --> 48:16.670
<i>Yo, Frankie, something's off. You read me?</i>

48:16.680 --> 48:19.360
- Saleem, where are you going,
- <i>Frankie, you copy?</i>

48:20.810 --> 48:21.650
Shit!

48:23.720 --> 48:24.860
Frankie!

48:29.860 --> 48:31.330
No! Frankie!

48:36.310 --> 48:39.440
- Oh, fuck. 
- No. No.

48:39.570 --> 48:41.730
Shit. Andros.

48:47.160 --> 48:52.630
Fuck! Frankie! 
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

49:09.560 --> 49:11.550
What the fuck is going on?

49:28.180 --> 49:29.590
What is that?

49:37.030 --> 49:39.610
I still can't make sense of it.

49:40.350 --> 49:41.750
I.. just...

49:45.900 --> 49:50.350
I don't know.
Here's a guy...

49:52.210 --> 49:55.580
Who's been... risking his life for
the past year, helping us.

49:58.050 --> 50:01.430
You think he was working
against you this whole time?

50:05.440 --> 50:07.850
He had a lot of other chances.

50:08.940 --> 50:11.940
A lot of them would've
done way more damage.

50:13.410 --> 50:14.800
I just... I don't know.

50:19.190 --> 50:21.420
What do you think, Brick?

50:22.460 --> 50:24.780
Don't even matter what I think.

50:26.300 --> 50:29.600
Would you say that you and
Saleem were good friends?

50:29.740 --> 50:30.970
Saleem?

50:33.110 --> 50:34.910
Yeah, I'd say so.

50:35.340 --> 50:37.920
Is that why you took it upon
yourself to bury him?

50:38.180 --> 50:39.140
No.

50:39.550 --> 50:41.250
Why did you do it then?

50:42.120 --> 50:45.400
HQ. said we had to keep
his death classified.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.760
But he still deserved a proper burial.

50:49.950 --> 50:52.840
How did you know how to give
him an Islamic burial?

50:54.660 --> 50:56.360
Know your enemy.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.750
If you believe in God,
now's the time to pray.

51:08.770 --> 51:10.430
And if you don't...

51:11.520 --> 51:13.220
Let's all just take a moment...

51:14.450 --> 51:15.870
Remember Frankie.

51:30.340 --> 51:32.820
I want everyone to take a couple
of minutes, get your heads right.

51:33.270 --> 51:34.550
Then get back to it.

52:12.800 --> 52:14.720
How did you feel when Frankie died?

52:24.220 --> 52:28.010
Uh, he... he was a good kid.
You know?

52:32.880 --> 52:36.400
But, actually, um, can we take
it back a couple of questions?

52:38.060 --> 52:40.990
Sure. 
Which one?

52:42.130 --> 52:43.600
When my tour's done...

52:46.090 --> 52:47.750
I'm gonna track down his mom...

52:49.070 --> 52:50.790
Give her a hug...

52:52.080 --> 52:54.360
Let her know that Frankie was a good kid.

52:54.580 --> 52:56.150
She should be proud of him.

52:58.670 --> 53:00.720
Then I'm gonna track down his father.

53:01.750 --> 53:03.340
I'm gonna look him in the face,

53:04.200 --> 53:07.750
And I'm gonna say, "Frankie's more
of a man than you will ever be."

53:12.060 --> 53:13.200
What's all that?

53:13.740 --> 53:16.680
This is everything Saleem had
in his possession when he died.

53:16.960 --> 53:19.170
Can you all keep it down, please?

53:20.450 --> 53:22.490
You think it'll help explain what happened?

53:22.830 --> 53:24.200
Can't hurt.

53:30.730 --> 53:34.000
Goddamn, that's a ugly
motherfucker right there.

53:36.740 --> 53:38.870
Oh, shit. it's that kid.

53:43.570 --> 53:45.690
Yo, can you translate shit like that?

53:47.480 --> 53:50.580
Ain't these missing people
from Saleem's village?

53:55.050 --> 53:56.750
Where they all going?

53:57.790 --> 53:59.280
What do you think it means?

53:59.670 --> 54:02.220
Sorry, I don't have time for
the camera right now.

54:03.760 --> 54:05.950
Mistakes were made last night.

54:06.880 --> 54:09.160
And we paid dearly for it.

54:09.730 --> 54:12.480
Our enemies don't care for the
ones you've lost.

54:12.510 --> 54:15.320
They don't care for the ones you love.

54:15.690 --> 54:19.080
Their objective is the
annihilation of humanity.

54:20.950 --> 54:22.270
Omohundro...

54:23.860 --> 54:26.420
Why'd you sign up for the USDF?

54:28.530 --> 54:32.130
To fight for my country,
for my planet, sir.

54:34.760 --> 54:36.740
Were you willing to risk
everything when you did?

54:37.040 --> 54:38.490
Yes, sir.

54:40.780 --> 54:43.600
- What about your life, son?
- Absolutely, sir.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.200
Exactly.

54:45.310 --> 54:46.520
Exactly!

54:46.530 --> 54:49.680
It's time for us to take this
fight to them!

54:50.430 --> 54:54.840
It's time that each and every
one of them must pay!

54:55.050 --> 54:57.960
And today we make those bastards pay.

55:00.040 --> 55:01.560
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

55:01.680 --> 55:04.350
- I said, do you got it?!
- Sir, yes, sir!

55:16.540 --> 55:20.660
All right, everybody, listen up!
Swap out your ammo for reds! let's go!

55:39.080 --> 55:41.950
- Anything?
- Negative, sir.

55:42.570 --> 55:44.330
What do you want do, captain?

56:19.900 --> 56:21.360
Geisterstadt.

56:28.180 --> 56:29.330
Let's go.

56:53.240 --> 56:56.030
- Bravo, is that you?
- Ziege.

56:56.120 --> 56:57.650
Hans, English!

56:57.760 --> 57:00.450
He said "goat." Ain't nothing here but a
motherfucking goat.

57:00.720 --> 57:03.640
- Any sign of North?
- No, he's not here, man.

57:04.410 --> 57:06.790
- There's no one here.
- Find Saleem's house yet?

57:06.860 --> 57:10.460
- Not yet, man. - How we supposed to
even tell which one is his, anyway?

57:10.680 --> 57:11.830
Copy that.

57:15.570 --> 57:18.540
Scratch that. 
We found it.

57:31.150 --> 57:34.680
God damn it, we've got shots fired!
I repeat, shots fired. Alpha, is that you?

57:34.960 --> 57:37.250
- Negative, captain.
- All right, stay where you are.

57:37.270 --> 57:39.410
Let's go! Move! Move! Move!

57:39.910 --> 57:42.720
Mac, put that fucking thermal
down and grab your weapon.

57:43.580 --> 57:46.580
Hans, Omo, with me.
Go. Go. Go. Go.

57:47.320 --> 57:49.580
Get your binocs out, scope out those trees.

57:51.080 --> 57:53.140
We got movement at 11:00.

57:56.330 --> 57:57.800
Stay alert.

58:00.830 --> 58:03.020
Shit, it's North.
We got North.

58:03.270 --> 58:05.200
Wilks, we need you out here now.

58:05.240 --> 58:07.610
<i>Copy that.
 I'm on my way.</i>

58:15.190 --> 58:17.750
Guys, coming up on your left!

58:20.810 --> 58:23.290
Where the fuck is everyone going?

58:31.890 --> 58:33.440
Is his temp low?

58:34.530 --> 58:35.940
He's good.

58:36.900 --> 58:38.570
98.6

58:41.300 --> 58:43.940
North had been shot three times

58:44.140 --> 58:46.470
But he was strong, 
stable.

58:48.110 --> 58:51.860
Which was a relief at the time.

58:53.310 --> 58:56.869
I mean, there's a million things
you wish you could've done

58:56.870 --> 58:58.590
differently when you look back.

58:58.710 --> 59:00.440
But that's the catch.

59:02.380 --> 59:05.350
You can't look back when you're in it.

59:06.390 --> 59:08.630
All you can do is move forward.

59:12.690 --> 59:14.050
March or die.

59:19.040 --> 59:20.900
He's been out since the ride home.

59:21.830 --> 59:26.420
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Yeah. he's an ox.

59:28.680 --> 59:29.590
Come here.

59:31.810 --> 59:33.860
Ah that's where he got shot...
One here

59:34.540 --> 59:36.410
One here, and over here.

59:38.930 --> 59:41.060
He's lucky he's dehydrated.

59:43.840 --> 59:46.890
Vitals are surprisingly okay,

59:48.860 --> 59:51.960
But... I just want be sure before
I move him, you know?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.190
Check out his eyes. 
R.E.M. sleep.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.440
So...? It's repeating,

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.310
I think he's trying to tell us something.

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:14.920
I'm getting a problem with the thermals
here. Looks like a blob or something.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.430
Just restart. I'm sure it'll fix it.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.490
Copy that.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.390
- What you got there?
- I'll let you know once I figure it out.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.860
All right. 
Or I could just tell you.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.860
- What is it?
- It's tap code.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.580
No, man, can't be tap code.
There's a 9 and a 6 in there.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:44.510
Do you mind?

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.670
Let's see here...

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:59.360
L-a-t.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.460
L-o-n. Oh, shit.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.480
Show him, Mac.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.840
Okay, that's 3. That's 3.

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:17.740
That's 6. That's 5.

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:21.590
There's gonna be a quick pause.
And then it's gonna start again, sir.

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.630
North.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.320
We understand you're giving us coordinates.
If you can hear me

01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:31.720
just give me a sign.

01:01:34.365 --> 01:01:36.925
Wilks, he's in there. Do you have
something that can wake him up?

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:40.680
Nothing, his vitals are normal.
It's more like a state of paralysis.

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:41.910
Grant...

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:46.280
Listen to me.
What's at those coordinates?

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.250
You got it? 
What is it?

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.270
It says "Steel Rain," sir.

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:13.850
Kill me! Kill me!

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:46.590
This ain't a error, Mac.
There's something out there.

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:49.420
Okay, hold on.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.810
What are humans doing with Heavies?

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.020
All units, man defensive positions. Contact
imminent. I repeat, contact imminent.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.390
- Put General Dane on the line right now.
- <i>One moment.</i>

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:08.750
<i>Dane here. 
Go ahead, captain.</i>

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.362
General, we have hundreds
of insurgents and

01:03:10.388 --> 01:03:12.108
an unknown number of
Heavies two klicks out.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:12.820
<i>Together?</i>

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.700
Yes, sir.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.661
<i>We've got action all over the map.</i>

01:03:15.914 --> 01:03:18.115
<i>It's gonna be an hour before
we can provide air support.</i>

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.700
Sir, we are not staying here.

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.660
<i>What are you talking about, captain?</i>

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.750
General, North was K.I.A.,
but he communicated

01:03:23.776 --> 01:03:26.085
something before we lost him...
a set of coordinates.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.820
Steel Rain, sir.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.100
<i>Give me those coordinates.</i>

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.100
<i>Break contact. 
Fall back to Mako.</i>

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.740
Copy that, sir. Spears out.

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.980
Sir, what's "Steel Rain"?

01:03:44.755 --> 01:03:47.315
I want you to assemble all
the men at the snake's nest right now.

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.060
The enemy's gonna be here in minutes.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.660
Fuck. I knew it.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.261
And why is their temperatures low, man?

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.700
Yo, Mac, why's their
temperatures so low, man?

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.820
Dotson, Dotson, get back in the nest.

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:02.620
Keep an eye on that hill.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.260
Yes, sir.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.980
Mac, Brick, prep the ghoul with every
case of ammo we got for immediate EVAC.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.740
Bones, I want you on the mortar.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.180
Omohundro, Nakamura, and Harty,
you're on the north wall.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.500
Hans, you're on the east wall.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:17.980
Andros, I want you to rig this
entire fucking outpost to blow.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:18.860
Understood?

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:19.780
Yes, sir.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.460
Let's buy Andros some time.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.420
We're gonna light this place up, boys.

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.860
<i>Wilks, I want you out here right now.</i>

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.980
Be right there, captain.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.380
What the fuck?

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.780
Brick, I want daylight.
North ridge. Hit it now.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.980
Open up! Go!

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.660
Heavies, 
200 yards!

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:08.820
Go! Go!

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.220
All fire on that laser!

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.060
Go!

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.340
More Heavies, north ridge!

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.180
Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:33.900
- Oh, fuck, there's a lot of them!
- You got a Heavy, 11:00!

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.540
Move! Move! Move!

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.579
You got him!

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.700
Move it! We got another Heavy over there!
- RPG coming in!

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.100
You guys all right?

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.540
Captain, there's too many!

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.500
- We got to move!
- Hold your positions!

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:02.100
Andros, what's your ETA?!
Hurry up, son!

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.872
Need more time!

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.420
Come on! Fire it up!

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.140
Scheisse!

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:16.180
Fire straight up the wall!
Heavy laser charging up!

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.540
Incoming!

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:21.700
Omo!

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.300
They've breached the wall!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:26.580
Come on!

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.860
You good?
Then grab your weapon!

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.980
Get back on that wall!
Zilla, on your back!

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.569
You solid?
Damn it, Andros, we're out of time!

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:37.020
Two more to go, sir!

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.220
Brick, you all right?

01:06:42.452 --> 01:06:43.340
They're making a push!

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.740
There's too fucking many!

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.820
There's too many!

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.500
The outpost is hot!

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.780
Everybody cover the wall... now!

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:05.540
Zilla, I need reds!

01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:09.060
Coming in with reds!

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.568
Zilla, are you all right?!

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:18.154
Everybody, fall back to ghoul!

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.020
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:24.420
Go! Let's go! Move!

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.700
Fucking move!
- Move! Move!

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:42.620
All right, let's go! Clear out!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:45.100
Everybody, load up! Load up!
Everybody in!

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:47.740
Go, captain! Go!

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.059
God damn it, Wilks, where you going?

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.700
Got to move!
Load up! I'll be right there!

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.580
Go! Go! Go! Get in! Get in!

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.980
Let's go! Let's go! Move it!

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.540
Load up! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:05.500
Come on! Go!

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:13.660
Sir, can I blow it?!
Affirmative! Now!

01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:34.779
Latch them goddamned doors!

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.260
Brick!

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.580
Brick! Goddamn fucking harness.

01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:50.300
- No! No! No!
- What?!

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.790
I got him. I got him.

01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:55.620
Don't touch him! don't touch him!
No!

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.580
Move! Go! Go! Go! Brick!

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:00.939
No! No!

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:07.100
No! No!

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.380
- Get... oh!
- No!

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:19.734
The moment that we lost Brick was
probably the lowest point in my career.

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.700
Maybe my life.

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:32.540
You know, there's those guys
that you know just can't die.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:36.420
You know, you're sure of it, and, um...

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:42.779
and Brick was one of those guys.

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:53.700
And every time you lose someone,
you... you tell yourself, "okay,

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.688
that's it. That's... that's the last one
that they're gonna take."

01:09:57.689 --> 01:10:01.700
And was he the last one?

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.780
- General, it's Spears.
- Spears, what are you doing?

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:13.140
I'm doing what needs to be done.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.371
Get back here asap.

01:10:14.372 --> 01:10:18.940
- North provided this intel for a reason.
- PFCS say nothing's out there.

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.940
General, there was something
embedded in his brain.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:25.380
I think the Heavies are using it
for some kind of mind control.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.140
You have your orders. 
Follow them.

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:28.180
Look, sir, you...

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:36.100
What I'm about to ask you to do

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.980
is in violation of a direct order.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:42.859
I do not expect any one of you
to burn for my decision,

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:48.260
but I do believe that there is a real
and imminent threat down there.

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:53.900
We're all soldiers, and we all
signed up for the same reason...

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.454
to protect our families, to protect
our friends, and to protect this planet.

01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:01.620
And those bastards are here
to take that away from us.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:08.020
They are here to eliminate everything
that we are and everything that we love.

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.218
If your conscience is
telling you to walk

01:11:10.244 --> 01:11:12.012
away, then I want you
to walk away right now.

01:11:12.013 --> 01:11:15.432
But if you do leave here, you leave
here with your head held high

01:11:15.433 --> 01:11:18.978
Because each and every one
of you have earned that right.

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.020
And I will always respect you for that.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.828
Sir, we're coming up on the coordinates.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.340
Ain't nobody here.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.916
I'm going up

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:44.629
There's something up on the right.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.020
What the fuck?

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.900
Omo, get your ass down here now!

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.020
Contact!

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.860
Zilla, get us out of here now!

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.820
Come on, Zilla!
It won't start!

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:04.100
All right, listen up!
Bravo team, with me!

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.900
Alpha team, get this vehicle operational!

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.300
Let's move! Let's move!

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.660
Bravo, we got a Heavy at 1:00!

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.660
- We got a Heavy at 11:00!
- Move!

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.940
We got to recon and find out
what that thing is!

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.540
Right there!

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.180
I got another Heavy up on the ridge!

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.300
Move over, the other side of the ditch!

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:27.380
Frag out!

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.700
Move! Move! Let's go!

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.180
- We're right behind you, sir!
- Covering fire!

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.900
- Move!
- Bravo!

01:12:34.409 --> 01:12:36.889
Mac, get under the hood, see if
you can get her up and running.

01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:37.390
Yes, sir.

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.433
Let's go.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:41.019
- Let's go. Lefty, Righty, hold positions.
- Yes, sir!

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.460
Bones, stay on that 50!

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.620
Hans, you're with me.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.860
- Covering!
- Hold up. Hold up.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.700
- Covering fire!
- Everybody ready?

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.900
- Covering!
- Covering fire!

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.820
- Covering fire!
- Keep going! Stay on that ridge!

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.332
Move! Everybody, take cover!

01:13:03.333 --> 01:13:06.380
I got him!

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:16.580
- Entrance... your 2:00.
- Copy that!

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.431
Heads up! Get ready to move!

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:20.860
Move in!

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.140
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:25.060
We got a bird in the sky!

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.260
This is Sergeants Wilks of O.P. 37.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.500
My men are pinned down in the valley below.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.180
Requesting air support. Will you comply?

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.744
<i>Roger that, sergeant.
Dane thought you guys might need some help.</i>

01:13:40.745 --> 01:13:41.620
Copy that.

01:13:45.114 --> 01:13:46.195
That's right, motherfucker!

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:47.541
All right, I move and you follow.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.380
Copy that.

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.969
Move! Move! Move!

01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:00.700
Eyes up! Eyes up, captain!

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:04.519
Move! Move! Move!

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:09.540
They're trying to keep you away from
the entrance! We'll provide cover!

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.140
- Son of a... 
- Andros, give me a door!

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.900
Go!

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.180
Here we go!

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:38.928
Move! Let's move!

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.780
Moving!

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.700
Wilks, keep that door clear
so we have a way out!

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.300
<i>Copy that, sir. Good luck!</i>

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.300
What the hell is this place?

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.124
Now listen up.

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:13.296
We find whatever it is that's
holding this place up.

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.860
Andros, you're gonna blow it to hell.

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.100
Copy that.

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:22.700
Harty, Omo... 
go.

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.018
Okay, let's go.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.580
Captain, you need to come look at this.

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.100
Oh, fuck!

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.580
It's the missing locals.
And the PMC soldiers.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.500
Ah! They're waking up!

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.660
We got to go! We got to go!

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.620
Come on, move!
Get the hell out of here!

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.220
Andros! Grenade in, go!

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.780
Fall back! They're in the hall!
Take cover!

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:27.140
Cover!

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.380
Red flag out!

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.592
Last red flag!

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:45.820
Let's go, boys!

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:46.597
Come on!

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:52.580
One more up ahead!

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:53.646
Grenade!

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.180
They're down!

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.110
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:01.860
Clear?

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.980
- Clear!
- Sir, over here.

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.820
There's another one of those rooms.

01:17:22.475 --> 01:17:24.155
You guys need to get the hell
out of there!

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.511
This thing is powering up!

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.819
Andros, rig that piece of shit to blow!
Let's go!

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:31.180
Everyone, set a perimeter!
Move! Move! Move!

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.420
Talon 8, you need to move out!
You're in immediate danger!

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:41.027
<i>Roger that, sergeant.
One more strike, and off the mic.</i>

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:44.100
Oh, shit.

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:46.420
Watch it, Mac! I gotta reload!

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.820
Motherfucker!

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.740
Andros, let me know when
we're rigged and ready to go!

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.500
- Yes, sir!
- They're coming this way!

01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.380
Andros, we got to move, son!
Let's go!

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.220
God damn it, give me some cover!

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:11.460
Set!

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:15.140
Get over there!

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.660
Fuck!
Give him some cover!

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.140
What the fuck is that?!

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.100
<i>Mayday, mayday, this is Talon 8!</i>

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.740
<i>We have got multiple system failures!</i>

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:38.100
Fuck!

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:41.540
Mac, we're heading back to you!

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:45.620
Falling back!
Ready? Cover!

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:49.140
Copy that!
Come on!

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.620
Move! move!
Back to the vehicle!

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:52.807
Move! Move!

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:57.260
I got you! Move! Come on!

01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.180
Let's go! Let's go!

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.402
Andros, you all right?

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:08.540
The wireless transmitter's been hit. Grab
the wire, trigger, and knife from my bag.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.020
We got a Heavy coming!

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.420
Motherfucker!

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.220
All right, now! Here we go!

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.260
It won't catch!

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.420
The ground receiver... cut that into it.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.460
Now give it to me and get the fuck out
of here! Bullshit. With one hand.

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.540
Click, click, click, boom, right?

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.100
Yeah.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.821
All right, you guys get him out of here!

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.700
- On set!
- Harty, take Andros!

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.860
Omo, provide covering fire!
Move!

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:47.740
- Covering fire!
- Heavy!

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:52.533
Zilla!

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.900
Give it a try again.

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:03.500
Heavy!

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:10.700
Captain!

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.220
Lefty!

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.860
What the fuck?
Get Hans! Get him in that vehicle!

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.700
Turn it around!
Hans, are you good?

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.020
Yeah, I'm good.
Come on.

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.619
You're gonna need a new leg,
but you'll make it.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.500
Coverage!

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:36.260
Now!

01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:39.780
Get him out of here now!

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.940
Let's go! Move!

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.252
Andros, go!

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.060
Mac, get them on the horn!

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.301
We need to get the fuck out of
here while we still can!

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:50.980
Yes, sir. copy that.
Here we go.

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.300
Omo, I'll do it.

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:10.100
I won't make it.
Let me do it.

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.780
I got this.
You get them out of here.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.300
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Let's go!

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.300
Clear out!

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.780
Omo, load up!

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.380
Let's go!

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.180
One...

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:32.940
Stay with him.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.741
Come on, boys!
Where's the rest of them?

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:36.900
They didn't make it!
Go! Go! Go!

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.940
- Yes, sir!
- Wilks, get in!

01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:40.980
Two...

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:45.820
three!

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:50.340
Fuck!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.420
- Help!
- Stop!

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:07.780
Why aren't they shooting at us?

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.900
- Please stop!
- Something's wrong with them.

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.420
Help us! Please!

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.140
Help us!

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.100
Why do you think the Heavies
invaded earth?

01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:25.220
I don't know.

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.439
I don't think anybody has
the answer to that.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.500
I don't know why they came.

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:36.460
I do know that tens of millions
died because of them.

01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:39.783
And I'm doing everything that...

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:44.060
We're doing everything that we can to
make sure that they never come back.

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:09.540
Fuck! What is it?
Omo! Omo!

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:10.620
Stay here.

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:30.500
We lost a lot of good men.
But the price was worth it.

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:36.060
It was worth it.

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:37.985
Whoo!

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:42.740
At least, that's what I tell myself.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:46.035
I still see the guys we lost every day.

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:48.780
Take care.

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:49.538
See you.

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:54.001
I worry, you know, 
not... not, uh...

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:59.180
Not for myself, but that their
sacrifice will go unnoticed...

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:06.060
These men, men who gave their lives
for people who didn't even believe in them.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.900
So, what did "Steel Rain" mean?

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.020
The second wave.

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.500
See you on the ground!
