35:45.655 --> 35:48.907
And you think I can unbind you?

35:49.200 --> 35:52.828
There's your ridiculous bravado again.
Of course, you can't.

35:52.995 --> 35:56.581
But you can help me take the bullets
out of Lucifer's gun.

36:01.045 --> 36:04.214
I understand you want this.

36:07.593 --> 36:10.762
- Yeah.
- I'm inclined to give it to you.

36:10.930 --> 36:12.931
- To give it to me?
- That's what I said.

36:15.560 --> 36:18.603
But what about Chicago?

36:22.692 --> 36:24.818
I suppose it can stay.

36:25.278 --> 36:26.903
I like the pizza.

36:34.495 --> 36:35.871
There are conditions.

36:37.874 --> 36:38.915
Okay. Like?

36:40.334 --> 36:44.462
You have to do whatever it takes
to put Lucifer in his cell.

36:46.132 --> 36:48.049
- Of course.
- Whatever it takes.

36:48.885 --> 36:51.136
- That's the plan.
- No. No plan. Not yet.

36:53.264 --> 36:54.389
Your brother.

36:54.557 --> 36:57.559
He's the one that can stop Lucifer.
The only one.

37:00.271 --> 37:01.354
- You think...?
- I know.

37:03.441 --> 37:05.942
So I need a promise.

37:06.110 --> 37:10.405
You're gonna let your brother
jump right into that fiery pit.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.707
Well, do I have your word?

37:28.174 --> 37:30.508
Okay, yeah. Yes.

37:33.721 --> 37:36.431
That had better be "yes," Dean.

37:36.724 --> 37:38.975
You know you can't cheat death.

37:44.357 --> 37:48.318
Now, would you like
the instruction manual?

38:08.839 --> 38:10.507
[CRACKLING]

38:11.354 --> 38:13.396
[SIGHS]

38:19.070 --> 38:20.987
How'd it go
at the Rockettes audition?

38:22.698 --> 38:24.824
High kicks, fair. Boobs need work.

38:26.535 --> 38:30.622
I walked up and down stairs all night
for no damn reason.

38:31.165 --> 38:32.832
I'm sore.

38:33.834 --> 38:37.170
Feels so good, I'm scared it's a dream.

38:38.005 --> 38:43.385
But then I remember
that the world's dying bloody, so drink?

38:48.474 --> 38:49.516
Check it out.

38:55.731 --> 38:57.232
<i>BOBBY:
Mm.</i>

39:01.112 --> 39:02.612
No.

39:02.780 --> 39:05.323
Death told you how to operate those?
The whole deal?

39:05.491 --> 39:07.492
Yeah. It's nuts.

39:08.911 --> 39:10.495
Of course, I got bigger problems.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.164
Really? Like?

39:13.457 --> 39:16.543
What do you think Death does to people
who lie to his face?

39:16.836 --> 39:19.337
- Nothing good. What'd you say?
- Yeah.

39:23.217 --> 39:26.303
That I was cool with Sam driving the bus
on the whole Lucifer plan.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.141
So Death thinks
Sam ought to say yes, huh?

39:31.892 --> 39:35.270
- I don't know. Yeah.
- Hm.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.315
He'd say that. He works for Lucifer.

39:38.482 --> 39:40.567
Against his will, I thought he said.

39:40.735 --> 39:43.445
Well, I'd say, take his sob story
with a fat grain of salt.

39:43.612 --> 39:44.696
I mean, he is Death.

39:45.406 --> 39:47.407
Exactly. He's Death.

39:47.575 --> 39:49.701
Think of the kind of bird's-eye view.

39:50.953 --> 39:52.454
- Seriously?
- I'm just saying.

39:52.621 --> 39:54.831
Don't.
What happened to you being against this?

39:54.999 --> 39:58.543
Look, I'm not saying
Sam ain't an ass-full of character defects.

39:58.711 --> 39:59.961
- But...
- But what?

40:01.088 --> 40:02.130
[SIGHS]

40:02.298 --> 40:07.927
Back at Niveus I watched that kid
pull one civilian out after another.

40:08.095 --> 40:12.140
He must've saved 10 people.
Never stopped. Never slowed down.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.769
We're hard on him, Dean.
We've always been.

40:16.771 --> 40:19.397
But in the meantime...

40:19.565 --> 40:23.276
he's been running into burning buildings
since he was, what, 12?

40:23.444 --> 40:25.070
Pretty much.

40:25.279 --> 40:29.991
Look, Sam's got a darkness in him.

40:30.159 --> 40:32.369
I'm not saying he don't.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.747
But he's got a hell of a lot of good
in him too.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.459
I know.

40:40.086 --> 40:44.839
Then you know Sam will beat the devil
or die trying.

40:47.134 --> 40:49.719
That's the best we could ask for.

40:52.723 --> 40:54.974
So I gotta ask, Dean.

40:55.810 --> 40:57.685
What exactly are you afraid of?

40:59.814 --> 41:00.980
Losing?

41:02.108 --> 41:03.483
Or losing your brother?

41:04.305 --> 41:10.637
