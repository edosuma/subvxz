00:09.834 --> 00:10.667
Yeah!

00:11.625 --> 00:12.709
Wow, Jack.

00:12.959 --> 00:14.750
Your new bo staff routine is awesome.

00:14.834 --> 00:15.709
Thanks, man.

00:16.166 --> 00:18.083
You know what I say about bo staffs?

00:18.166 --> 00:19.709
Bō-ring.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.291
Swords is where it's at, bro.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.000
- Oh, so you know how to use a sword?
-

00:25.250 --> 00:27.875
I've been practicing with the attachments
on my mom's vacuum cleaner.

00:28.041 --> 00:30.083
In one move,
I can whack the ceiling fan down, and...

00:30.166 --> 00:32.458
...suck the curtains off the wall.

00:34.583 --> 00:37.500
Well, that katana sword that
Rudy loves so much is right there.

00:37.959 --> 00:39.875
Yeah, give it a shot, Jerry.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.208
Uh...

00:41.875 --> 00:43.500
Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll...

00:44.125 --> 00:45.125
I'll give it a shot.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.750
You know, I'm not sure
the thing's as balanced

00:46.834 --> 00:48.417
as well as my mom's vacuum cleaner.

00:48.834 --> 00:51.667
And there's, uh, there's no brush
on the end of it,

00:51.750 --> 00:53.792
but, uh, I'll give it a shot.

00:53.875 --> 00:55.125
- Hey, Jerry.
-

00:56.041 --> 00:56.875
Whatcha doing?

00:56.959 --> 01:00.208
Uh, just airing out the pits.

01:02.291 --> 01:03.250
Well, let me be clear.

01:04.417 --> 01:06.500
No one touches my katana.

01:10.834 --> 01:11.792
Bobby, what's wrong?

01:11.875 --> 01:12.834
Oh, Rudy.

01:13.417 --> 01:15.250
I didn't get the part in that movie.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.458
I'm sure the part was just wrong for you.

01:18.041 --> 01:20.417
It was to play Bobby
in "The Bobby Wasabi Story."

01:21.041 --> 01:23.458
Well, maybe there's another part for you.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.542
I'm Bobby.

It's over.

02:10.542 --> 02:12.083
My movie career is over.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.125
I have nothing left,

02:14.250 --> 02:16.458
except my eight houses, 40 dojos

02:16.542 --> 02:18.917
and a toilet carved out of a giant ruby.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.041
Well, you think my life is perfect?

02:23.208 --> 02:25.709
My girlfriend broke up with me
three months ago.

02:26.083 --> 02:28.250
She said I didn't pay enough attention
to her.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.166
I miss Jenny.

02:30.542 --> 02:31.667
Her name was Carol.

02:32.333 --> 02:33.542
Whatever her name was...

02:34.375 --> 02:35.250
I miss her.

02:35.875 --> 02:36.875
It's okay, Rudy.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.583
- Let's get our cry on.
-

02:47.792 --> 02:48.875
Hey, hey, hey!

02:49.709 --> 02:52.667
Rudy, I need you
and your mustache bear man

02:52.750 --> 02:53.750
to stop crying.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.750
I'm trying to have a happy hour.

02:59.917 --> 03:01.000
What's wrong with you?

03:01.083 --> 03:04.041
I haven't had a day off in 17 years.

03:05.250 --> 03:08.125
Everything is work, work, work.

03:09.166 --> 03:10.583
We have to take our lives back.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.208
Go someplace where men can be men.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.375
- The sauna.
- I'm in.

03:16.417 --> 03:18.792
I'm talking about
really taking our lives back.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.333
You know, going out on the open road.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.542
You know what we're gonna do?

03:23.875 --> 03:26.542
We're gonna get on some hogs and ride.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.417
That's brilliant! A pig rodeo!

03:32.375 --> 03:33.750
I'm talking about motorcycles.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.458
Pigs on motorcycles?

03:37.125 --> 03:40.083
It's getting wild up in here.

03:46.041 --> 03:47.125
Yep, kids.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.834
Every once in a while,
you have to put on the leather pants

03:49.834 --> 03:52.000
and hit the open road with the boys.

03:52.959 --> 03:54.291
Now, all I need is for one of you guys

03:54.417 --> 03:56.125
to come in on Saturday
and water the plants.

03:56.208 --> 03:57.041
- You got it.
- Sure.

03:57.125 --> 03:57.959
I'll do it.

03:58.041 --> 03:59.083
All right, let me get the keys
from the office.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.000
Cool.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.834
They're in my pocket.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.583
Hey, hey!

04:19.667 --> 04:22.500
Our gas-powered pigs are ready to ride us.

04:24.542 --> 04:27.792
I'm gonna feel so alive out there
on the open road.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.125
Men being men.

04:30.625 --> 04:31.875
I should put my hair back.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.458
Kim, can you spot me a scrunchie?

04:35.625 --> 04:38.041
Okay. Okay, guys, I've got the keys.

04:38.709 --> 04:39.625
Let's go.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.542
Well, see you guys in a few days.

04:43.834 --> 04:44.667
- Bon voyage.
- Bye-bye.

04:44.750 --> 04:45.583
- See ya.
- See ya.

04:45.667 --> 04:46.542
<i>Whoo!</i>

04:47.208 --> 04:49.750
That is the worst biker gang ever.

04:51.375 --> 04:56.750
Guys, we've got these keys
and Rudy's gone for the weekend.

04:57.417 --> 04:59.041
Do you know what that means?

04:59.125 --> 04:59.959
Yes.

05:00.583 --> 05:01.917
We need to come up with a chart

05:02.000 --> 05:04.542
with everyone's
plant watering responsibilities.

05:06.166 --> 05:07.417
No, Eddie.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.875
It means we can throw that party
we've always wanted to have.

05:09.959 --> 05:10.792
- Yeah.
- Oh.

05:10.875 --> 05:14.041
With girls and music and girls
and food and girls.

05:15.417 --> 05:16.667
Do you know who we should invite?

05:17.375 --> 05:18.875
- Brad Wolf.
- Kathy Davis.

05:21.750 --> 05:22.834
Brad's a good guy.

05:23.250 --> 05:26.625
Yeah, Kathy's nice.

05:28.208 --> 05:29.667
Now, let's get back to the party.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.583
Rudy will flip if he finds out,

05:31.667 --> 05:34.166
so we have to keep things small
and under control.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.792
This party is both huge
and out of control.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.500
This is the greatest.

05:52.834 --> 05:53.917
Hey, Phil.

05:54.041 --> 05:56.458
You should probably put the wind visor
on your helmet down.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.166
What is a wind visor?

06:01.125 --> 06:03.500
This trip was long overdue, Rudy.

06:03.834 --> 06:06.667
Feels like the old Bobby's back
in the game.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.041
Whoo!

06:08.125 --> 06:09.333
-
- Whoa!

06:11.125 --> 06:12.542
<i>-</i>

06:12.625 --> 06:13.667
He's okay.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.333
Luckily, that barn stopped him.

06:20.125 --> 06:22.000
All right, party people.

06:22.083 --> 06:25.625
I'm DJ Eddie D., and this one goes out
to Kim Crawford.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.291
Oh, yeah!

06:30.375 --> 06:31.583
This is my jam!

06:43.208 --> 06:44.208
Where's Brad?

06:45.375 --> 06:47.875
Um, I don't know.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.291
I just started dancing,
turned around, and he was gone.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.250
Huh? That's weird.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.750
So, um, where's Kathy?

06:59.917 --> 07:02.125
She's, you know,
we're having a great time,

07:02.375 --> 07:03.667
hanging out, tearing it up.

07:03.750 --> 07:04.750
She didn't show, did she?

07:04.834 --> 07:05.667
No.

07:07.917 --> 07:09.166
Great party.

07:09.458 --> 07:12.166
I've had so much grape juice,
I bet my uvula's purple.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.417
Check it out.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.792
Dude, who let you in here?

07:17.875 --> 07:19.208
Kevin, I get it.

07:19.291 --> 07:20.917
You're the captain of the football team.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.542
You get into all the parties,

07:22.625 --> 07:24.792
but I don't give a fiddler's fart
about that.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.333
You're looking at your worst nightmare,

07:28.417 --> 07:29.834
a nerd with a clipboard.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.959
Hey, come on, man. Can I just get...

07:33.041 --> 07:33.875
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!

07:33.959 --> 07:36.125
Don't beg, Kevin. It's just sad.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.125
Why are we stopping here?

07:46.208 --> 07:48.083
That billboard said two miles up

07:48.166 --> 07:50.542
is a restaurant
that serves a 'splodin' onion.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.000
- That did look good.
- Yes.

07:52.083 --> 07:55.834
And I'll say it, I would love
to have an onion 'splode on my face.

08:01.667 --> 08:02.709
Can I take your order?

08:03.333 --> 08:06.041
Uh, how would you describe your trout?

08:06.875 --> 08:08.834
- It's a fish.
- Ooh.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.333
- I recognize you.
- You do?

08:12.417 --> 08:14.583
I mean, of course, you do.

08:14.667 --> 08:18.291
I am Bobby Wasabi, legendary film star.

08:18.375 --> 08:19.709
Not you. Him!

08:20.458 --> 08:21.875
You're Rudy.

08:22.125 --> 08:24.125
I've seen all your karate commercials.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.291
Your moves are...

08:25.792 --> 08:27.083
amazing.

08:27.750 --> 08:30.041
Yeah, I mean,
I guess I do have a few moves.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.667
Can we get back to my trout, please?

08:35.291 --> 08:38.500
So, um, I see your girl Kathy
finally showed up.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.500
Yeah, she's over there dancing
with your boy Brad.

08:40.583 --> 08:41.458
What?

08:42.583 --> 08:46.291
So, uh, since they're...
do you think we should...

08:46.417 --> 08:48.417
- We could, but do you think it would...
- Yeah, it might.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.750
- Maybe it won't.
- What if it does?

08:49.834 --> 08:51.875
- Yeah, we probably shouldn't.
- Yeah, let's get some chips.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.166
- I like chips.
All right.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.166
Watch it. Move it. Thank you. Watch it.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.959
Whoa, I told you, you're not getting in.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.417
No, no, no, check again.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.500
I think we're under
the name "Bum-rush Plus Three."

09:03.375 --> 09:04.417
I don't see a Bum--

09:04.500 --> 09:05.417
Whoa. Oh!

09:05.667 --> 09:07.500
Oh. Ow!

09:17.709 --> 09:19.625
Jack, Jack.

09:20.959 --> 09:21.792
Gah!

09:22.125 --> 09:24.125
Whoo!
- These guys crashed the party.

09:25.959 --> 09:27.667
Kevin, you guys gotta go.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.875
I don't think so. We just got here.

09:38.875 --> 09:41.542
Come on, Kevin, be cool.
We don't want any trouble, all right?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.709
You see, it's rude to punch the host.

09:52.917 --> 09:53.959
Ahh!

10:10.417 --> 10:11.500
This is not good.

10:12.041 --> 10:13.959
We are in so much trouble.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.250
We just gotta clean this up, okay?

10:19.583 --> 10:21.125
But what do we do about that?

10:23.333 --> 10:25.083
Rudy's priceless katana is gone.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.834
He is gonna kill us.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.583
At least he won't be doing it
with the sword.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.041
And that's not even the worst part.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.000
We forgot to water the plant.

10:44.417 --> 10:45.417
I found one!

10:45.792 --> 10:47.709
It's the same exact sword that Rudy had.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.792
It's at the Bronze Nugget Pawnshop.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.291
Yes! All right, Kim, Milton, let's go!

10:53.875 --> 10:55.375
Oh, that's gross.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.458
Who would deliberately stick
a piece of pizza up there?

10:59.458 --> 11:01.500
Well, probably a guy who was gonna eat it,

11:01.583 --> 11:03.667
then saw Donna Tobin come in
and wanted to talk to her

11:03.750 --> 11:05.166
without having pepperoni breath.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.667
I'm just guessing.

11:17.458 --> 11:22.583
I wonder how many kebabs
I could kebabi with this big kebab stick.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.667
It's not a kebab stick, you rube.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.417
It's called a pool bat.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.542
I'd like to settle up now...

11:37.834 --> 11:39.250
Carlotta.

11:39.333 --> 11:41.125
Call me Carlotta.

11:41.208 --> 11:44.583
Okay then, Carlotta.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.709
So, um, what are you gonna do now?

11:49.792 --> 11:53.542
Just climb on your hog and ride away?

11:54.250 --> 11:57.625
My friends and I are living life
the way a real man should live.

11:58.375 --> 11:59.250
<i>Rudy!</i>

11:59.917 --> 12:02.583
I can't get the ball wrangler off
of my face.

12:04.834 --> 12:07.792
Excuse me, Carlotta.

12:09.625 --> 12:10.834
Who was that you were talking to?

12:10.917 --> 12:12.250
None of your business, Dwayne!

12:12.792 --> 12:14.417
But when he says my name...

12:15.166 --> 12:17.125
it feels like Christmas.

12:19.417 --> 12:20.417
Easy, easy.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.041
Get some butter. Get some butter!

12:24.083 --> 12:25.875
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

12:25.959 --> 12:29.500
This, boys and girls, is the real deal.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.667
Completely unique.

12:31.750 --> 12:35.250
There's only one
that exists in the whole world.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.667
Actually, our sensei has one just like it.

12:40.542 --> 12:43.959
There's only two that exist
in the entire world.

12:46.375 --> 12:47.750
We've got to get it for Rudy.

12:48.709 --> 12:50.125
How much do you want for it?

12:50.500 --> 12:51.750
Five hundred dollars.

12:51.834 --> 12:52.667
What?

12:52.917 --> 12:54.333
We don't have that kind of money.

12:54.417 --> 12:57.333
Well, you have to bring in something
of equal value to trade for it.

12:57.417 --> 13:00.750
Hey, maybe your friend would like

13:00.834 --> 13:04.625
this priceless Ben Franklin toenail.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.667
That's a corn chip.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.458
Oh, no!

13:09.959 --> 13:11.917
I ate a national treasure!

13:16.709 --> 13:18.000
This place looks great, man.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.583
Yeah, the last thing to do
is move my speaker.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.500
Oh, yeah, for sure.

13:22.750 --> 13:23.875
- All right, ready?
- Yeah.

13:23.959 --> 13:25.417
- One, two, three.
- Go.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.083
-
- Whoa.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.417
Uh, Eddie?

13:30.500 --> 13:31.375
<i>Hmm?</i>

13:31.458 --> 13:33.250
Was this big purple stain always here?

13:33.625 --> 13:35.000
No.

13:41.125 --> 13:42.333
It's grape juice.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.542
All right, let's just wipe it off.

13:44.625 --> 13:47.375
No, no, no! You can't just wipe off
a stain like that.

13:47.792 --> 13:50.500
Once it soaks in,
you gotta get it from the inside.

13:51.709 --> 13:53.583
But how are we gonna clean it
from the inside?

13:53.875 --> 13:54.875
<i>How's it looking?</i>

13:56.041 --> 13:57.917
Keep going. I think it's working.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.667
<i>Yes! I knew I could get it out.</i>

13:59.750 --> 14:01.166
<i>Whoo! Oh, no.</i>

14:01.750 --> 14:03.250
Wait, what's the matter? Why'd you stop?

14:03.709 --> 14:06.709
<i>Dude, when I dropped between the walls,
I wasn't thinking about getting out.</i>

14:07.166 --> 14:09.333
<i>Dude, I'm stuck.</i>

14:09.417 --> 14:11.709
<i>I'm freaking out, man. I can't breathe!</i>

14:11.875 --> 14:12.750
Oh!

14:15.083 --> 14:17.166
Well, the stain's gone.

14:22.291 --> 14:25.709
Well, I've totaled up
all the stuff you've brought,

14:25.792 --> 14:27.875
and I think you'll be happy to hear

14:27.959 --> 14:30.291
I can give you $94.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.291
- What?
- Are you insane?

14:32.875 --> 14:34.875
- Guys. Guys, guys, guys.
-

14:35.166 --> 14:37.250
Calm down, okay? It's okay.

14:38.083 --> 14:39.250
I got this.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.041
I was hoping not to have to do this,

14:43.125 --> 14:44.792
but what do you say if I was willing

14:44.875 --> 14:47.625
to throw in this antique charm bracelet?

14:48.041 --> 14:49.458
Ooh...

14:51.000 --> 14:52.917
I'd say I'll give you another three bucks.

14:54.166 --> 14:55.166
- That's it!
- What?

14:55.250 --> 14:56.291
- Oh, okay.
- Whoa.

14:57.583 --> 15:01.083
Ninety-seven dollars for all your junk.
Take it or leave it.

15:01.458 --> 15:02.792
Can I see that old French horn?

15:03.166 --> 15:04.000
Sure.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.875
Will you trade this for all our stuff?

15:15.333 --> 15:16.333
I can do that.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.834
Milton, what are you doing?

15:19.125 --> 15:19.959
Trust me.

15:29.041 --> 15:31.709
You know a little something
about the French horn, don't you?

15:31.792 --> 15:35.750
This horn was made by the greatest
French horn maker and composer ever.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
See that little LS under the spit valve?

15:39.291 --> 15:41.500
That stands for Lorenzo Sanzoni.

15:41.834 --> 15:44.208
I thought that stood for "loud sound."

15:45.792 --> 15:47.000
How much is that thing worth?

15:48.041 --> 15:49.250
I think you mean,

15:49.333 --> 15:52.667
"How much is this thing worth, boss?"

15:53.792 --> 15:56.000
'cause we just bought ourselves
a pawnshop.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.792
- Oh, yeah.
- Now, hand me that sword.

16:00.792 --> 16:02.458
And organize the shelves.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.834
And take out this toy cannon.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.583
And patch up that hole.

16:10.875 --> 16:13.583
Yeah, you heard him. Move it.

16:19.625 --> 16:22.500
I'm a little worried about all
of the peanut shells on the floor.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.125
No one's gonna slip
on the peanut shells, Phil.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.875
No, no, I'm not worried about slipping.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.667
I'm worried about attracting elephants.

16:32.250 --> 16:36.375
Well, well, looks like we got ourselves
a couple poseurs.

16:37.583 --> 16:38.625
Poseurs?

16:38.875 --> 16:40.125
You calling us poseurs?

16:40.208 --> 16:41.458
I sure am.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.125
Your hogs are rented.
Your boots aren't broken in.

16:44.208 --> 16:46.458
And your face isn't all windburned
from ridin'.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.250
For your information,

16:48.333 --> 16:51.125
I use a really good
Aloe-based skin moisturizer.

16:52.959 --> 16:54.125
We don't want any trouble.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.125
We're just trying to play
a nice game of pool.

16:56.208 --> 16:57.333
Nobody needs to get hurt.

17:05.542 --> 17:07.458
I'm sorry. I got a little under that one.

17:07.709 --> 17:08.583
Oh.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.041
You broke my pool bat.

17:15.417 --> 17:16.250
Oh.

17:20.375 --> 17:21.333
Get 'em!

17:27.000 --> 17:28.542
Oh, mommy!

17:46.667 --> 17:47.625
You're doing great.

17:48.041 --> 17:50.208
-
- Thank you, Carlotta.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.333
Hyah!

18:00.709 --> 18:01.875
Oh...

18:01.875 --> 18:04.250
That felt so great.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.667
It looks like this old lion
may still have his roar.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.542
Now, that is the Bobby Wasabi
I used to know.

18:14.125 --> 18:15.917
Hey! Hey, talk to me, buddy.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.166
What happened?

18:19.709 --> 18:21.417
Did the elephants come for me?

18:22.291 --> 18:25.458
You were in a roadhouse brawl.
Are you okay?

18:25.750 --> 18:26.834
I'm better than okay.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.500
This is the best day of my life.

18:31.291 --> 18:33.083
I feel so alive.

18:33.792 --> 18:36.750
Best road trip ever!

18:37.291 --> 18:38.875
Come on, little buddy.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.709
Rudy, Rudy.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.917
I found one of your teeth
underneath the pinball machine.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.083
Keep it, Carlotta.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.291
It'll give you something
to remember me by.

18:51.542 --> 18:52.375
Oh...

18:52.667 --> 18:54.667
I'll keep it under that weird flap of skin

18:54.750 --> 18:56.083
on the back of my neck.

18:58.041 --> 18:59.375
Okay, that I didn't need to know.

19:22.041 --> 19:23.834
You did it. This place looks great.

19:24.333 --> 19:26.125
- We got the sword.
- Yes!

19:26.417 --> 19:29.375
Wait, guys, there's something
I need to tell you.

19:31.208 --> 19:32.917
It's Rudy. He's back.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.375
We've got to get the sword up there.

19:34.458 --> 19:35.625
Give it to me.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.291
Well, see you guys next time.

19:39.959 --> 19:42.291
Hey, Rudy. How was your trip?

19:42.875 --> 19:45.208
It was amazing. How's everything here?

19:45.667 --> 19:47.166
Everything here is great.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.041
Well, the place looks great.

19:53.834 --> 19:54.875
The plant's been watered.

19:54.959 --> 19:56.375
Oh, that was me. All me.

19:58.041 --> 19:59.375
Wait, something's different.

20:01.542 --> 20:02.583
My katana.

20:03.750 --> 20:04.625
Nah, it's fine.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.625
How come I get so crazy about that thing?

20:08.709 --> 20:11.959
It's just a knockoff I paid 15 bucks for
at the flea market.

20:13.083 --> 20:14.125
Knockoff?

20:15.083 --> 20:16.291
Flea market?

20:17.166 --> 20:18.375
Do you have any idea--

20:18.458 --> 20:21.250
How glad we are to have you back, Rudy?

20:21.333 --> 20:22.458
We missed you.

20:23.041 --> 20:24.583
Why don't we all go over to Falafel Phil's

20:24.667 --> 20:26.083
and you can tell us all about your trip?

20:26.166 --> 20:27.000
Come on, we'll buy.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.875
Go ahead. I'm just gonna put my stuff
in the office.

20:29.000 --> 20:29.917
I'll be right there.

20:33.041 --> 20:35.500
Do you realize we just went through
all of that for nothing?

20:35.834 --> 20:37.083
It wasn't for nothing.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.750
We threw an awesome party
that Rudy will never know about.

20:40.291 --> 20:41.792
And you weren't even out
of the parking lot

20:41.875 --> 20:43.667
before I started texting people
about the party.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.875
Of course, we didn't know
we were gonna trash the place

20:46.000 --> 20:46.875
and steal your sword.

20:46.959 --> 20:49.208
And when I say trashed,
I mean tornado-style, Rudy.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.375
And you wouldn't believe
what happened to me.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.208
You got stuck in the wall.

20:56.000 --> 20:56.959
Yes.

20:57.375 --> 20:58.458
How did you know?

20:59.166 --> 21:01.917
Wait. Wait. Rudy, Rudy!

21:02.500 --> 21:04.542
Rudy, seriously, I'm freaking out.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.542
Wow, my birthday falls
on a Friday this year.

21:09.792 --> 21:13.667
Peanut shells on the floor
will make this place fun like roadhouse.

21:15.792 --> 21:17.083
Not now, Rudy. I'm busy.

21:18.750 --> 21:20.625
Rudy, I said I'm busy.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.834
Funny, Rudy...

21:25.500 --> 21:27.333
Your hand feels a lot like...

21:28.709 --> 21:31.750
Elephant!

21:56.917 --> 21:57.834
<i>Poor soul.</i>
