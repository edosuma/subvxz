WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:09.241
(excited chatter)

00:23.491 --> 00:27.126
("Concerto for Orchestra")

01:05.699 --> 01:08.600
- [Woman] Ted
offered you a drink.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.438
- [Woman] Oh my God,
did you actually do it?

01:12.440 --> 01:13.372
- [Woman] Yes.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.207
Do you always do the same thing?

01:15.843 --> 01:18.844
- Well babe, remember
my first drink?

01:19.847 --> 01:21.080
- [Woman] Are you okay?

01:21.082 --> 01:22.181
- [Woman] Yeah.

01:25.152 --> 01:27.553
- [Man] Are you okay?

01:27.555 --> 01:30.456
I mean I'd be stumbling too
if I had to wear those heels.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.125
(chuckling)

01:33.127 --> 01:35.260
- [Woman] We're gonna go.

01:41.368 --> 01:42.601
- [Man] Whoa, hey, oh God.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.835
Look why don't we just find
somewhere for you to lie down,

01:43.838 --> 01:45.304
how about that?

01:45.306 --> 01:46.438
Come with me.

02:12.199 --> 02:16.135
- [Chad] Stan, get down
here it's important!

02:31.185 --> 02:33.418
- Is everything okay, is your
concussion acting up again?

02:33.420 --> 02:36.288
- Everything is in
a word, bodacious.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.457
I'm Tindering this town
to Dante's second, third,

02:38.459 --> 02:40.225
and fourth dimensions of hell.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.196
- So this self proclaimed stud
on my emerging markets team

02:44.198 --> 02:45.597
tried to talk me into Bumble,

02:45.599 --> 02:47.199
(chuckling)

02:47.201 --> 02:48.600
last week he had four matches,
each described herself

02:48.602 --> 02:49.868
as administrative assistant.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.603
And so I asked him
what kind of assistant

02:51.605 --> 02:53.939
to what kind of
administration is that?

02:53.941 --> 02:55.841
Turns out they were all hookers.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.310
- Of course, sexual
entrepreneurship's
a booming business

02:58.312 --> 02:59.611
in the VC space.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.313
- So he messaged them
all saying what's up?

03:01.315 --> 03:02.781
And they replied with a link

03:02.783 --> 03:05.284
and it wasn't to a Facebook
page, it was to a Fuckbook page.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.553
- What's up, who says
that, I mean besides you?

03:07.555 --> 03:09.621
- I didn't come to Gotham
to pay for herpes alright,

03:09.623 --> 03:10.956
when it's free as
air in West Virginia.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.624
- Oh please a V is a V.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.293
- And HIV is HIV.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.362
- Yeah but if everyone has AIDS
then no one has AIDS right?

03:17.364 --> 03:20.265
In other news, I am meeting
up with a girl named

03:20.267 --> 03:21.466
(choking)

03:21.468 --> 03:22.634
Tiffany tonight.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.237
- Tiffany, that
sounds very promising.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.505
Can I go back to
my room now please?

03:26.507 --> 03:28.607
I get about an hour a
month to write, honestly.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.309
- No, you live under my roof,

03:30.311 --> 03:32.811
that means you follow my
rules, you're coming with.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.513
- Oh oops, I'm not
dressed appropriately,

03:34.515 --> 03:36.281
looks like you're gonna have
to go without me, it's okay.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.349
No, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.984
- You're not doing
this again, okay?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.786
Nine months ago because
I felt sorry for you

03:40.788 --> 03:43.956
and your prevential ass, I
let you move into this place.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.225
And the only time that
you've come out with me

03:46.227 --> 03:50.295
was alumni weekend, and
I remember you had fun.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.564
You may not think that you
had fun, but I remember,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.499
you had fun.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.302
- That was your
definition of fun?

03:57.304 --> 03:59.504
Because if I remember correctly
you guys vanished on me

03:59.506 --> 04:01.240
after an hour, I had
to spend 60 bucks

04:01.242 --> 04:03.742
on the campus bus driver to
take me back to the Motel 6,

04:03.744 --> 04:05.644
which was awful, so I
think your friends suck,

04:05.646 --> 04:06.845
no offense though.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.380
- No offense, please,
no offense taken.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.649
My friends do suck but at
least they're interesting.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.351
What about you huh?

04:12.353 --> 04:15.487
Big writer, tell me something,
what are you writing about?

04:15.489 --> 04:16.954
You don't do anything.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.658
All you do is sit back there
in that closet of yours.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.394
(sighs)

04:22.396 --> 04:23.295
- Closet you put me in.

04:26.834 --> 04:27.733
God.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.971
I'm gonna ask it, who's
the girl, who's Tiffany?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.773
(laughing)

04:34.775 --> 04:37.476
- She is an assistant,
in what else?

04:37.478 --> 04:38.977
Marketing.

04:38.979 --> 04:42.514
Women's work, 21st century
update of stitching quilts.

04:42.516 --> 04:45.917
I work at like a app
yeah, and like our office

04:45.919 --> 04:48.520
looks straight down at
Diane von Furstenberg

04:48.522 --> 04:51.857
which is like amazing,
obviously, the coolest.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.425
- Let me tell you
something, on your dates

04:53.427 --> 04:54.793
if you actually asked
these girls questions

04:54.795 --> 04:57.062
other than which room
at the Metropolitan Club

04:57.064 --> 04:58.797
they wanna get married in,
you'd learn pretty quickly

04:58.799 --> 05:00.465
that they're a lot
smarter than you are.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.435
- Metropolitan
Club, look at you!

05:03.437 --> 05:06.371
The point is I understand
dating apps and I retain

05:06.373 --> 05:07.472
the perfect profile
because of it.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.342
For instance,
here's a photo of me

05:10.344 --> 05:11.510
with an African child.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.079
- Oh, I didn't know
you went to Africa?

05:14.081 --> 05:15.547
- I didn't, that's
my maid's kid.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.482
- Oh, so you're a fraud
and a liar, that's nice.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.451
- What do you have to
offer, huh, big shot?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.853
You and your toothy grin
on your family farm,

05:21.855 --> 05:23.922
All American Gothic,
holding a giant scissors.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.390
- It's called a scythe.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.658
- Whatever, if dating
apps were repining mothers

05:26.660 --> 05:30.095
you'd kill it, the
problem is I'm a Chad,

05:30.097 --> 05:32.331
you're a Stanley.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.099
- Hey don't call me Stanley,
please, I've told you!

05:34.101 --> 05:36.468
- Girls they see your name
and they immediately think of

05:36.470 --> 05:38.036
a guy in a white button
down who wants to

05:38.038 --> 05:41.506
talk about his favorite
evangelist, it's not sexy.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.442
- While you're trying to
triangulate your Facebook link

05:43.444 --> 05:45.610
to multi-ethnic trimber
within 10 blocks

05:45.612 --> 05:47.913
I bet you I can discover a
girl worthy of our attention

05:47.915 --> 05:49.848
before you and do it
the old fashion way.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.017
Yeah, no apps, no
Rwandan huskies,

05:52.019 --> 05:53.685
you know just me being me,

05:53.687 --> 05:56.555
Guinness Book of World Record's,
Greatest Guy of All Time.

05:57.791 --> 05:58.657
- You're on.

05:59.793 --> 06:00.592
- No.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.626
- [Chad] Yes!

06:01.628 --> 06:03.095
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:03.097 --> 06:06.498
- Yes, yes, you Mr. Writer,
Stan, you are a writer,

06:06.500 --> 06:08.133
you need to have an experience.

06:08.135 --> 06:13.405
This will be an experience,
have this experience.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.775
And if you come I'll
have Tiffany bring her

06:16.777 --> 06:19.511
Guinness Book of World's
Record, Greatest Girl.

06:23.384 --> 06:26.551
- Fine, fine, I'll get
changed, how 'bout that?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.086
- Yes!

06:28.088 --> 06:30.122
This is gonna be the greatest
night of your life, I promise.

06:30.124 --> 06:32.023
And please just put those
jeans on that I got you

06:32.025 --> 06:34.526
for your birthday, they
make your ass look great.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.962
- Oh God, please
don't do that again.

06:36.964 --> 06:37.863
- 10 minutes!

06:38.899 --> 06:41.733
(dramatic music)

06:52.546 --> 06:54.846
God I hate Union Square.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.081
Leave the Upper East
Side to come to this

06:56.083 --> 06:57.849
bridge and tunnel shit
hole, it'd be great

06:57.851 --> 07:00.118
if you're a dental
assistant from Nayack.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.686
We're gonna end up
going downtown anyway.

07:01.688 --> 07:04.856
Why not just commit, go
all the way downtown?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.057
- It's just a quick six down.

07:06.059 --> 07:06.992
- Please don't ever
say that again.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.794
Trey, my boy!

07:08.796 --> 07:09.861
- [Trey] Chadwick!

07:09.863 --> 07:10.695
- Get over here.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.131
- [Trey] Come here you.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.601
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
- Tickle, tickle, tickle.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.436
- Boy you are a stud.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.637
- What's up man?

07:18.639 --> 07:20.071
- Good to see you buddy,
hey good to see ya.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.541
- Good to see you too.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.875
I haven't touched my hair.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.544
- Let's get you caught up,
yeah let's take some shots.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.213
Paige got us a table at Up
and Down so we're gonna get

07:28.215 --> 07:30.215
a little more sauced and
then head on down there.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.751
- Sauced, sounds good.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.186
Where are your parents?

07:34.188 --> 07:37.088
- Oh my pops is in Beijing
destroying the yuan.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.757
(chuckling)

07:38.759 --> 07:41.126
- For me Chinese currency
is all a big yuan.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.727
(chuckling)

07:42.729 --> 07:43.728
Get it?

07:43.730 --> 07:44.896
- Mm hmm, no I get it.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.802
Oh where are my, this is Maddie,
and Paige, lovely humans.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.636
- Nice to meet you.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.571
- Hi.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.772
- Two of my faves.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.908
- Yeah, very pretty,
Trey I love your place,

07:56.910 --> 07:58.910
it's fantastic,
- Thank you, thank you.

07:58.912 --> 07:59.845
- especially your
deck, it's so big.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.714
- Oh Stanley, you like my deck?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.216
Big, oversized,
- oh no not like

08:04.218 --> 08:05.050
I was joking.
- massive deck.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.651
(laughing)

08:06.653 --> 08:08.086
- [Stan] Thank you, thank you.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.621
- A little homosexual
Stanley, but you know what?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.556
Let's take some shots, get
some liquor in the system,

08:11.558 --> 08:12.557
there we are.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.025
- Hard alcohol?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.927
- Hard alcohol buddy boy,
it'll go down smooth,

08:15.929 --> 08:17.062
I promise you.

08:17.064 --> 08:17.996
- Okay.

08:17.998 --> 08:18.797
- Not as smooth as my deck.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.831
Here we are ladies.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.933
Cheers.
- Cheers.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.602
Hey Cheers.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.003
- [Chad] Cheers.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.241
(choking)

08:29.243 --> 08:30.675
- [Trey] Careful there.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.044
- That's nice, burns the pipe.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.280
(girls laughing)

08:36.283 --> 08:39.116
(dramatic music)

08:45.225 --> 08:47.225
- Alright gentlemen,
have a good time.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.927
Alright ladies have a good time.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.161
- Thank you.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.830
- Excuse me, sorry,
hi, we're on the list

08:51.832 --> 08:53.098
Adrian knows we're coming.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.533
- [Doorman] Sorry

08:54.535 --> 08:55.300
We have a table.
- not on the list.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.868
- You didn't even ask my name.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.039
Can you please tell
Adrian that Paige is here?

09:01.041 --> 09:01.873
- [Doorman] Nah.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.174
- Why the hell not?

09:03.176 --> 09:04.576
- 'Cause you got like
five guys and five girls

09:04.578 --> 09:06.678
and I don't need no
more dicks in the club.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.979
(chuckling)

09:07.981 --> 09:09.681
- Don't clubs ever
want good looking guys

09:09.683 --> 09:11.683
to attract good looking
girls, am I right?

09:11.685 --> 09:13.585
- No, they don't,
then I would get in.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.721
- Hey people, how
you doing there?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.856
Nice to see you, I'm
homeless I got no money.

09:17.858 --> 09:21.026
Can you guys do
something about it?

09:21.028 --> 09:23.261
I even got papers
here to prove it,

09:23.263 --> 09:25.096
I'm totally homeless.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.299
- Yeah, yeah, let me guess,
you're also a Vietnam Vet.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.067
- Yeah that's right,
what about you?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.001
- [Chad] Whoa, hey.

09:30.003 --> 09:30.802
- You ever been overseas?

09:30.804 --> 09:31.736
- [Chad] What the fuck!

09:31.738 --> 09:32.337
- You ever fought in a war?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.673
- Buddy, buddy here.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.641
- [Vet] And they call me a bum!

09:36.643 --> 09:38.977
No thank you you keep
it, you're a good guy.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.645
- I'm sorry.

09:40.647 --> 09:41.880
- [Vet] This piece of
shit over here, scum bag,

09:41.882 --> 09:43.114
douche bag.
- I know he is.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.649
- [Chad] He's a scum
bag, you're right.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.051
A fucking asshole.
- Fuck 'em where they breathe.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.118
- You know what man I've had
enough tonight, I'm leaving,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.053
I'm out of here.

09:48.055 --> 09:48.853
- [Chad] No, no, no, no, no.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.288
- I'm leaving man.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.089
- Stan, don't leave,
don't leave, don't leave.

09:51.091 --> 09:51.756
Say sorry, say sorry!

09:51.758 --> 09:52.357
- Sorry Stanley.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.992
- He's fucking sorry,

09:53.994 --> 09:55.327
It's okay, I just.
- he's very sorry.

09:55.329 --> 09:58.129
- Look, if you come in
with me, I'll blow you.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.764
- You are so weird.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.199
- Yeah you obviously
didn't consider that

10:01.201 --> 10:02.634
before you felated me.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.170
- [Maddie] Oh my God,
ew, that was like what,

10:05.172 --> 10:06.104
sophomore summer?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.606
- Yeah well nobody forgets

10:07.608 --> 10:09.674
their first Madison
Square Park beej,

10:09.676 --> 10:10.609
(speaking foreign
language) Maddie.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.743
Hey fuck this, here buddy.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.111
- [Stan] Hey, what, what?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.012
- Yeah, we're going in, open
the fucking rope, let's go!

10:14.014 --> 10:17.282
- [Doorman] Right welcome.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.217
- [Stan] Thank you.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.352
- [Doorman] Have a good time.

10:20.354 --> 10:23.622
(upbeat club music)

10:39.973 --> 10:41.840
Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:43.844 --> 10:44.676
- [Chad] Let's get it started!

10:44.678 --> 10:47.312
(club chatter)

11:12.072 --> 11:15.106
- I'll just do
like a vodka soda.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.780
Thanks.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.150
Very festive.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.755
So when you're out in the
city do you ever feel like

11:30.757 --> 11:33.024
you're at a Georgetown
reunion or something?

11:33.960 --> 11:34.859
- What?

11:36.163 --> 11:37.395
- I was just looking
around and I thought that.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.764
- How would you know
I went to Georgetown?

11:39.766 --> 11:41.433
I don't know you.

11:41.435 --> 11:46.705
- I didn't I, okay, well.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.374
(sighs)

11:51.478 --> 11:53.044
- Where'd you go to school?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.314
- I went to WVU.

11:57.451 --> 11:58.450
- What's that mean?

11:59.720 --> 12:03.822
- It's a university,
not like lol.

12:04.758 --> 12:05.824
(chuckling)

12:05.826 --> 12:07.792
- Oh yeah, isn't
that like a hospital?

12:07.794 --> 12:10.829
- Yeah you're right it
is, Western Veterans U.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.765
Brother college to WHD,
Women's House of Detention,

12:13.767 --> 12:16.835
great mixers if you
know what I mean.

12:16.837 --> 12:17.802
(chuckling)

12:17.804 --> 12:18.436
You don't?

12:18.438 --> 12:19.904
No, that's great.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.442
Great time, I'm
having a great time.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.855
(dramatic music)

12:42.329 --> 12:45.396
(upbeat club music)

12:54.775 --> 12:56.207
Sorry, thank you.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.443
I'm 0 for two.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.944
- Oh, I'm shocked.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.915
Tiffany and her friend
are gonna meet us here,

13:03.917 --> 13:06.351
hopefully she's
whatever it is you like.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.520
- Oh please we both know
the only reason I'm here

13:08.522 --> 13:09.954
is to distract her, right?

13:09.956 --> 13:12.857
So you and little miss
intern can hook up, huh?

13:15.061 --> 13:16.995
Jesus, where are
they by the way?

13:16.997 --> 13:18.897
- Women!

13:20.100 --> 13:22.467
They're all the same,
whether it's the first date

13:22.469 --> 13:24.469
or the 50th they
never come on time.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.505
- And who's fault is
that Speedy Gonzalez?

13:27.507 --> 13:30.475
(speaking foreign language)

13:30.477 --> 13:33.144
- The problem with our
friend Stan here is

13:33.146 --> 13:37.816
he's sensitive, he's sweet.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.018
He's naive, he's romantic.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.188
He doesn't realize there's
a precedent in place.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.022
Right?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.223
Party hard in college,

13:45.225 --> 13:47.091
work pre Emancipation
Proclamation hours

13:47.093 --> 13:48.860
for four years at a big bank.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.128
Then you go to a hedge fund

13:50.130 --> 13:52.997
where you're massa
of the plantation.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.034
Then at 32 find some
desperate 27 year old

13:56.036 --> 13:58.937
who realizes her last
five years at B.B.D. & O

13:58.939 --> 14:00.905
were a giant waste of
time and all she wants

14:00.907 --> 14:03.141
is a ring, your parents
place in Florida,

14:03.143 --> 14:04.542
and your fucking sperm.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.478
- You know what?

14:07.480 --> 14:08.880
Before you know it all the
marry-able women will be taken,

14:08.882 --> 14:10.615
and you'll be left
sitting at you desk

14:10.617 --> 14:12.851
with a terminal case
of quantitative easing.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.118
- Woo!

14:14.120 --> 14:15.587
You should've been a writer.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.455
- [Tiffany] Chad, hi.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.523
Hey
- Tiffany.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.024
Tiffany.
- Nice to meet you.

14:20.026 --> 14:20.859
- [Chad] Hey.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.126
- [Tiffany] Hi.

14:22.128 --> 14:22.961
- [Chad] You wanna get in.

14:22.963 --> 14:23.995
- Hi.

14:23.997 --> 14:24.963
- [Woman] Hi.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.166
- You can sit here.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.934
Thank you.
- Thanks.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.970
- [Chad] Hey how you doing?

14:31.972 --> 14:32.971
Have a drink?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.072
- [Tiffany] Yes.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.113
- Are you actually
texting someone on that?

14:44.351 --> 14:46.551
- You've learned the
ancient feminine trick

14:46.553 --> 14:51.623
of the fake text to seem
busy, my armor has vanished.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.658
- Oh no it wasn't aimed at you

14:53.660 --> 14:56.427
but why do people
do that anyway?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.162
- They can't stand the idea

14:58.164 --> 15:00.965
that someone might see
them standing alone.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.500
It's kind of like when
you're in a elevator

15:02.502 --> 15:05.203
with someone now and days,
no one has the fortitude

15:05.205 --> 15:07.338
to just stand there in silence,

15:07.340 --> 15:10.108
or maybe even strike
up a conversation,

15:10.110 --> 15:12.944
everyone just goes
straight to their phones.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.045
And guess what?

15:15.282 --> 15:17.215
- There's no cell service
in a elevator of course,

15:17.217 --> 15:21.653
so unless you're playing
Bejazzle you're lying, right?

15:21.655 --> 15:23.121
- Well Tiffany,

15:23.123 --> 15:24.088
I don't know what the
fuck they're talking about

15:24.090 --> 15:26.224
but I'm ready to leave, you?

15:26.226 --> 15:27.492
- [Tiffany] Yeah let's go.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.559
- Okay yeah.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.931
That went flawlessly.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.499
- She's good, he's
gonna like her.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.641
- Have we met before?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.343
- Good one.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.715
- Look I better just get
this out of the way now.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.952
The only reason I came here
tonight was to wing Chad.

15:53.954 --> 15:57.221
So I figured I'd just clear
the air before we get married

15:57.223 --> 16:01.125
and have kids, and I tell my
parents, this whole thing, so.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.329
- So this isn't your usual
stomping ground is it?

16:04.331 --> 16:06.531
- You caught me, the Dave
and Buster's was on the right

16:06.533 --> 16:07.498
and I turned left,

16:09.035 --> 16:11.436
but I definitely would
not of picked this place.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.603
- Right, 'cause you prefer

16:12.605 --> 16:14.739
someplace more
quiet and intimate.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.108
- Absolutely anywhere
but here, yeah.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.478
- I know of somewhere we can go.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.055
- Okay here we go
this extra step.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.357
(buzzing doorbell)

16:32.359 --> 16:33.257
Wow.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.069
¶ I don't like fellas
who get too pushy ¶

16:46.306 --> 16:49.040
¶ Who try to move me and
pursue me much too quick ¶

16:49.042 --> 16:53.111
¶ I need a little time to know
you if we're gonna click ¶

16:53.113 --> 16:57.115
¶ Please, please don't rush me ¶

17:01.054 --> 17:01.786
- [Stan] How?

17:01.788 --> 17:03.254
- [Woman] Isn't it cute in here?

17:03.256 --> 17:05.356
- Very pink, my
grandma would love it.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.224
- You should bring
her here next time.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.359
(softly laughing)

17:09.362 --> 17:10.261
- Hi.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.396
Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.566
- [Stan] Wow these
drinks are Yankees puns,

17:15.568 --> 17:17.068
that's amazing.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.136
- They are.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.170
- Have you decided?

17:21.074 --> 17:24.675
- He'll have a Murderer's
Row, and I'll have a Bambino.

17:24.676 --> 17:25.810
Thank you.

17:29.082 --> 17:32.350
I just realized I
don't know your name.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.820
- Oh my god, you
don't, my name is Stan.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.488
Nice to meet you,
what's your name.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.424
- You too, I'm Caroline.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.093
- Caroline, that's a great name.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.095
But it's a deal breaker I can't
go out with any Carolines,

17:44.097 --> 17:44.829
it's crazy.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.948
- Oh God, should I leave?

17:46.949 --> 17:49.066
- I'm teasing, I'm teasing,
I'm teasing, stay please.

17:49.069 --> 17:49.700
(chuckling)

17:49.702 --> 17:50.601
- If you twist my arm.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.074
So what do you and
your friend do?

17:56.076 --> 17:59.510
- Chad, he crunches numbers
and much to my chagrin so do I.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.181
- You don't strike
me as a finance guy.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.216
- Well I'm not, I'm
not, but I'll admit,

18:05.218 --> 18:06.651
and you won't see too
many people can see this,

18:06.653 --> 18:09.520
but before you file me under
douche bag I will admit

18:09.522 --> 18:14.192
that I grew up poor, and
rural, and I didn't like it.

18:15.128 --> 18:18.830
- Well that's a first
step, what about Chad?

18:18.832 --> 18:21.232
- Oh what about Chad?

18:21.234 --> 18:23.501
Chad came into finance
for the same reason

18:23.503 --> 18:25.837
all people born rich
still go into finance.

18:25.839 --> 18:28.306
- As Babe Paley once
said, "You can never be"

18:28.308 --> 18:30.441
"too rich or too thin."

18:30.443 --> 18:32.710
- Wow, look at you and
here I thought I knew

18:32.712 --> 18:34.745
every witty quote in
the book, but I thought

18:34.747 --> 18:36.314
that was Wallis Simpson.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.815
- Its a common
error, they were both

18:37.817 --> 18:39.884
very rich and very thin.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.153
- Touche.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.855
Wow.
- Thank you.

18:43.857 --> 18:46.491
- Look at these gender neutral
drinks, these are amazing.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.192
(laughing)

18:48.194 --> 18:48.893
- Should we cheers?

18:48.895 --> 18:50.328
- Yeah, cheers.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.834
Anyway, Chad's a finance
guy because it'll let you

18:56.836 --> 18:59.170
talk fast without actually
having to sound smart.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.173
So you can Uber and eat
for free, and in time

19:02.175 --> 19:04.575
you love to pay
retail, you can finally

19:04.577 --> 19:06.511
stop pretending you
actually read Moby Dick,

19:06.513 --> 19:08.212
and that anyone
who did is a loser,

19:08.214 --> 19:09.814
and you're not one of those
because you have a Black Card

19:09.816 --> 19:12.183
and a Brioni suit,
you're rich, right?

19:12.185 --> 19:14.619
(chuckling)

19:14.621 --> 19:19.690
- Yeah, so why are you
so clearly dissatisfied?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.228
- Does it show on my face?

19:24.230 --> 19:26.164
- All over, mm hmm.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.234
- No I think that we
all have baselines

19:30.236 --> 19:32.937
and even if you won the
Mega Millions jackpot

19:32.939 --> 19:34.438
you're eventually
going to return

19:34.440 --> 19:36.641
to your baseline level of
happiness and still make

19:36.643 --> 19:39.410
the same fundamental mistakes
that you've always made.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.245
- I don't know.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.550
I wanna question you on that.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.218
- Too cynical for you?

19:47.220 --> 19:49.954
- A little bit, I'm not so
sure about what you just said.

19:49.956 --> 19:50.888
(chuckling)

19:50.890 --> 19:51.789
- Friends.

19:53.760 --> 19:58.829
Yes you friends, your reportay
has caught our collective ear

19:59.966 --> 20:03.834
why don't you come and
join us, in fact I insist.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.604
- Gentle sir knight,
what is thy name?

20:08.308 --> 20:11.375
- Well my name is
Kentavious my fair lady.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.544
- Kentavious.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.547
- Let's go over there.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.748
- You wanna go,

20:17.750 --> 20:19.217
do you know those people?

20:19.219 --> 20:20.651
I like what we're
doing right here.

20:20.653 --> 20:24.589
- No I do too, but let's
do something unexpected,

20:24.591 --> 20:28.492
let's do something
spontaneous, don't worry,

20:28.494 --> 20:29.994
we can hold hands.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.295
- Promise?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.801
- Come on let's go.

20:36.803 --> 20:37.668
- Okay.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.277
- [Woman] Please.

20:51.684 --> 20:52.550
- Oh.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.319
(dramatic music)

20:55.321 --> 20:57.655
- Evening, I'm Oliver Smithson.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.426
- I'm Stan, just Stan.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.828
- Just Caroline.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.864
- Just indeed, indeed.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.299
(speaking foreign language)

21:12.538 --> 21:13.271
- Maxime, Soo.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.005
- Well isn't this
just about as diverse

21:14.007 --> 21:16.641
as the cover of a college
admissions pamphlet?

21:16.643 --> 21:18.409
- But our hearts are
as lily white as that

21:18.411 --> 21:20.344
of a Massachusetts puritan.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.546
- [Soo] And who would the
most astringent puritan be?

21:22.548 --> 21:24.315
- Why Jonathan
Edwards but of course.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.517
- Ah, good choice, Sinners
in the Hands of an Angry God,

21:26.519 --> 21:29.754
not to be confused with John
Kerry's sinful running mate.

21:29.756 --> 21:30.955
(laughing)

21:30.957 --> 21:32.657
- Who are the angry God
and the sinner, you?

21:32.659 --> 21:34.392
Or are we the sinners?

21:34.394 --> 21:35.960
- To address your point Stan.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.361
- Oh not really point,

21:37.363 --> 21:39.830
just a stab at a bad
joke to cut the tension.

21:39.832 --> 21:43.534
- To address your diversity
point the debutante era

21:43.536 --> 21:46.304
is far behind us now and
I for one am grateful

21:46.306 --> 21:48.339
to be admitted into
a good college.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.875
My sainted parents
would be so proud of me.

21:52.045 --> 21:54.745
- While some may think
that the diversity fight

21:54.747 --> 21:58.082
has been largely fought
and won, unbeknownst to you

21:58.084 --> 22:01.085
there have been not one,
but two nuclear fall outs

22:01.087 --> 22:02.453
from their struggles.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.489
Does this resonate with you?

22:07.026 --> 22:10.461
- Oh well more people
are speaking up

22:10.463 --> 22:12.213
and holding others accountable,

22:12.214 --> 22:13.964
and people don't like
being held accountable.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.467
So then there's the
backlash, and you end up with

22:16.469 --> 22:19.003
the Alt-Right, the fine
moral republic of Twitter.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.339
- [Maxime] Most people
get the first one.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.441
- What's the second?

22:23.443 --> 22:25.943
- I see in my mind's eye
just such a circular turning

22:25.945 --> 22:29.447
of the earth returning
to a time where the best

22:29.449 --> 22:32.049
like all conviction
where the worst

22:32.051 --> 22:34.418
are full of
passionate intensity.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.391
- Alright help him out,
let's get to the point.

22:40.393 --> 22:44.462
- Alright then, take
dear Kentavious here,

22:44.464 --> 22:47.798
how do you feel about judging
people you just met Stan?

22:47.800 --> 22:48.699
- Oh well I.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.703
- When Kentavious was
growing up he was an odd mix

22:52.705 --> 22:56.474
of shyness, resentment,
and explosiveness.

22:56.476 --> 22:59.877
And when he could
advert what did he do?

23:01.647 --> 23:04.782
- He started a Quebec
separatist movement in Denver.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.084
(laughing)

23:07.987 --> 23:11.956
Well I guess that Kentavious

23:11.958 --> 23:14.392
began calling
himself a republican

23:15.395 --> 23:16.927
in order to neutralize
the race issue

23:16.929 --> 23:20.531
with his classmates at Amherst?

23:20.533 --> 23:23.601
- Close, at Whitehall.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.002
Bravo Stan.

23:25.004 --> 23:28.506
- So Stanley what exactly
is it that you do?

23:30.410 --> 23:31.942
- The whole finance thing.

23:31.944 --> 23:35.513
- Oh, how disappointing I
was under the impression that

23:35.515 --> 23:38.716
there was gonna be so much
more to you than just that.

23:38.718 --> 23:41.152
- [Oliver] What do
you really wanna do?

23:41.154 --> 23:43.754
- I'd like to be a writer.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.456
- [Oliver] What kind of writing?

23:45.458 --> 23:47.625
- Just stuff that I write
home alone by myself really.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.693
- Well you're a writer
at a table of readers,

23:49.695 --> 23:51.896
so please read for us.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.431
- Oh, no, no, it's
really nothing more.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.767
It's writing home about,
you know what I'm saying?

23:56.769 --> 24:00.004
- Maybe later then, so
Caroline, what do you do?

24:00.006 --> 24:01.639
- I'm an assistant
curator at the Met.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.540
- Really?

24:03.476 --> 24:04.975
What period?

24:04.977 --> 24:08.879
- Early 20th Century American,
like the American Realists.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.216
- Well why don't you name a
few for us, so we can nod along

24:12.218 --> 24:16.487
and reply with a-ha, mm,
yes, as if we knew exactly

24:16.489 --> 24:18.122
who you was talking
about all along.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.691
- Don't worry about it,
honestly other than Hopper

24:20.693 --> 24:23.561
it's pretty much overlooked,
you barely even learn about it

24:23.563 --> 24:25.529
in a survey course.

24:25.531 --> 24:28.899
- Johnson's History of
Art, I bought mine used,

24:28.901 --> 24:30.968
every line
highlighted in yellow.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.137
- Well if every
line's highlighted no
line is highlighted,

24:33.139 --> 24:34.572
am I right?

24:34.574 --> 24:36.974
(chuckling)

24:44.050 --> 24:46.750
We have an appointment
that is soon approaching.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.724
- Here, let's see.

24:55.695 --> 24:59.597
I got some ones, some,
oh that's my Trip card.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.899
Hold on, I swear.

25:01.901 --> 25:06.036
- Stan, Stan the man, you
adorable phenic fox you,

25:06.038 --> 25:07.771
what do you think you're doing?

25:07.773 --> 25:09.006
- Well I was gonna just.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.108
- No, no, you're our
guy, put it away.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.646
- Thank you.

25:18.084 --> 25:22.686
- No Oliver, I'm gonna
pay for this one.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.656
- [Oliver] That's very
generous of you Kentavious.

25:25.658 --> 25:26.590
- [Kentavious] Mm hmm.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.293
- You guys are awesome.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.295
- [Kentavious] Hmm.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.532
(dramatic music)

26:04.297 --> 26:05.796
(sighing)

26:05.798 --> 26:06.630
(chuckling)

26:06.632 --> 26:07.731
- Whoa.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.904
Where are we?

26:13.906 --> 26:16.640
- [Maxime] I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.943
(laughing)

26:18.945 --> 26:20.578
Welcome.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.112
- [Woman] Thank you.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.584
(ringing doorbell)

26:26.586 --> 26:29.820
(upbeat techno music)

26:56.816 --> 26:58.182
- To the night!

26:58.184 --> 26:59.750
- To the night.

26:59.752 --> 27:04.288
- [Marguerite] Absinthe,
and anything else?

27:04.290 --> 27:07.725
- Champagne cocktails
all around my dear miss.

27:07.727 --> 27:11.295
A tower of bubbles to
the fathomless abyss.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.766
- Hey, hey, thank you.

27:17.637 --> 27:18.736
Nice.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.641
(laughing)

27:23.643 --> 27:27.044
Who are you guys, like
for real, I don't get it?

27:27.046 --> 27:27.878
(scoffs)

27:27.880 --> 27:30.781
- Come on Stan, drink.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.250
- Alright, to the night.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.355
- Good evening, and good morning

27:39.659 --> 27:43.327
to all you degenerates
of the dark.

27:43.329 --> 27:47.965
My name is Marguerite,
but you can call me Mom.

27:49.402 --> 27:53.237
My slaves shall bountifully
pour limited addition liquor

27:54.774 --> 27:56.907
(speaking foreign language)
upon the glass fortress.

27:56.909 --> 28:01.912
It is a token of the time we
spent in Sir Stan's company.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.848
Cheers to Stan.

28:04.850 --> 28:05.683
- To Stan.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.351
- To Stan.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.886
- Cheers to you.

28:08.888 --> 28:11.388
I so wish that the
divine intervention

28:11.390 --> 28:14.124
that brought us together
will be fruitful,

28:14.126 --> 28:16.794
it seems like only
moments ago that we met,

28:16.796 --> 28:21.865
and yet somehow I feel like
I know everything about you.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.436
To Stan!

28:25.438 --> 28:26.804
- [All] To Stan!

28:30.476 --> 28:35.746
¶ And her heart beat beat ¶

28:36.449 --> 28:39.183
¶ Feel her heart ¶

28:40.453 --> 28:42.953
- Okay, you're telling
me this is our guy?

28:42.955 --> 28:46.390
(dramatic music)

28:46.392 --> 28:48.926
- Yeah, it has to be.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.033
- You need to leave now.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.343
(club chatter)

29:08.147 --> 29:12.816
(singing in foreign language)

29:12.818 --> 29:13.851
- Right.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.119
- You okay?

29:15.121 --> 29:17.454
- Yeah, I'm fine thank you.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.824
- Stan read something that
you've written for us.

29:20.826 --> 29:23.327
- No, no, no, I don't have
anything on me at the moment.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.828
- Oh really?

29:24.830 --> 29:25.796
- Yeah.

29:25.798 --> 29:26.530
- What's this then?

29:26.532 --> 29:28.799
- Hey, that's my journal.

29:28.801 --> 29:33.137
- Alright you read us
something out of that journal

29:33.139 --> 29:37.975
and Caroline will give you
a kiss, won't you Caroline?

29:39.478 --> 29:41.912
- I'd love to hear
something you've written.

29:41.914 --> 29:42.813
- [Maxime] See?

29:44.049 --> 29:47.484
- Maybe when I find my
voice, I just like to observe

29:47.486 --> 29:49.019
what makes the people
in my office tick.

29:49.021 --> 29:52.556
I just try to describe it,
which is no small challenge

29:52.558 --> 29:54.558
I assure you, it's
like studying plants

29:54.560 --> 29:56.894
by going to the Antarctic.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.162
(laughing)

29:58.164 --> 30:00.531
- Come on please, will
you read something for me?

30:02.501 --> 30:04.935
- Not when you twist
my arm like that.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.070
I'll just read this
thing I wrote about the

30:07.072 --> 30:10.541
C suite execs going down to
the boardroom the other Monday.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.546
How they would rampage if
there were no constraint.

30:15.548 --> 30:18.916
If it weren't for their eyes
constantly reminding them

30:18.918 --> 30:20.884
they would see but
themselves in a vacuum.

30:20.886 --> 30:24.121
Once mesmerized by
Tantalos on the bank,

30:24.123 --> 30:26.490
now pulled by
Narcissus in the water,

30:26.492 --> 30:28.225
room for only one in the boat.

30:29.562 --> 30:33.030
Filled with thunderous angst
that since their not the leader

30:33.032 --> 30:36.900
they would happily kill all
until only one was left.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.368
- We'll the meter
is a bit rough.

30:40.072 --> 30:40.938
It's very nice.

30:40.940 --> 30:41.972
- Thank you.

30:45.177 --> 30:49.546
- You're angst reminds
me of someone I know.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.016
- Kentavious, what do you think?

30:58.858 --> 31:00.524
- I need to have
a word with you.

31:03.596 --> 31:04.494
Now.

31:05.598 --> 31:07.364
- Excuse us for a moment.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.536
- What are we waiting for?

31:12.538 --> 31:14.271
We need to get this
interview started now,

31:14.273 --> 31:16.907
instead of letting
him go back and forth.

31:16.909 --> 31:17.641
- You kidding me?

31:17.643 --> 31:19.142
You believe this guy did it?

31:20.279 --> 31:22.579
- That's what we're
here to figure out.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.582
- Even if he takes the bait
that doesn't prove anything

31:25.584 --> 31:28.585
with your sister, okay,
this is a terrible idea.

31:28.587 --> 31:32.990
- No, it's not a idea
anymore, this is happening.

31:42.001 --> 31:45.068
- Please tell me we didn't
miss anything too exciting?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.004
Caroline, did you fulfill

31:47.006 --> 31:48.939
your end of the
bargain yet with Stan?

31:49.675 --> 31:50.941
- No.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.010
No yet.

32:05.391 --> 32:08.225
(dramatic music)

32:14.667 --> 32:19.269
- Inhale slave, inhale bondsman.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.472
Inhale little boy.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.177
(choking)

32:27.179 --> 32:29.947
Try some more for good measure.

32:32.117 --> 32:37.187
¶ Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down ¶

32:43.362 --> 32:45.462
This is the stuff that elevated

32:45.464 --> 32:47.731
some of your deceased mentors.

32:51.971 --> 32:53.737
Do you know why I
brought you here?

32:55.341 --> 32:56.206
Hmm?

32:57.977 --> 32:59.443
So you're a mute, great.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.148
- I figured places
like this existed,

33:05.150 --> 33:06.516
but I never knew for sure.

33:08.053 --> 33:12.255
- And now that you do,
doesn't that excite you?

33:12.257 --> 33:15.592
Hold on let me guess, you're
not exactly the creative type?

33:15.594 --> 33:17.160
- [Stan] No, no,
no, I am, I just.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.230
- I just, I just I haven't
taken the creative leap yet!

33:20.232 --> 33:25.302
I've heard it 1,000 times
Stan, boo hoo, loser.

33:33.078 --> 33:35.212
- Why hasn't Maxime
said anything?

33:35.214 --> 33:37.414
- We thought it was
best to escort her

33:37.416 --> 33:39.316
away from all the hubbub.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.618
Put her to sleep, almost

33:41.620 --> 33:45.088
as if she's had a little
too much to drink.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.423
Serves her right.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.726
- She's okay though?

33:49.728 --> 33:52.696
- Well okay is a
broad term, alive yes.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.064
Will she live, yes.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.500
Is she okay though?

33:56.502 --> 34:00.103
Well I'm not sure about
that, but she really

34:00.105 --> 34:01.371
is something isn't she?

34:04.076 --> 34:05.675
- I hadn't really formed
an opinion of her,

34:05.677 --> 34:08.545
I just met her
about two hours ago.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.347
- Two hours ago!

34:10.349 --> 34:11.614
(laughing)

34:11.617 --> 34:16.053
You're funny, Maxime
liked that about you.

34:16.054 --> 34:20.424
She told me 1,000 times,
what is it you think you need

34:20.426 --> 34:24.061
to take that so
called creative leap?

34:24.063 --> 34:28.297
That is to be the creative
person you think you really are?

34:30.702 --> 34:33.770
- Experiences like this,
as my roommate Chad

34:33.772 --> 34:36.172
repeatedly reiterates to me.

34:36.175 --> 34:40.110
- Oh, your roommate Chad,
as if I don't know Chad.

34:40.846 --> 34:44.214
- How do you know
Chad, is he here?

34:45.250 --> 34:47.150
- [Marguerite] What
else do you need?

34:51.556 --> 34:54.257
- I need one motivating idea.

34:56.328 --> 34:59.129
One that will hold up
under repeated examination.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.266
One that will cook, brew

35:03.268 --> 35:06.436
and result in a
product that has value

35:07.873 --> 35:12.142
and will eventually be
recognized as beautiful,

35:12.144 --> 35:14.244
even if no one
knows who wrote it.

35:14.246 --> 35:19.316
- Oh yes, such a form as
Grecian godsmiths make

35:20.119 --> 35:22.886
to keep a drowsy emperor awake.

35:22.888 --> 35:26.756
What if I told you that I was
here to help make that happen?

35:26.758 --> 35:29.292
To sort of goose you along?

35:31.196 --> 35:33.196
The people at this club
are well connected,

35:33.198 --> 35:36.166
and here to help you get
all that you deserve.

35:36.902 --> 35:40.871
But of course you must
first pass their test.

35:40.873 --> 35:43.673
- Wait a minute, what test?

35:43.675 --> 35:45.208
Where's Caroline?

35:46.378 --> 35:49.913
- I don't know a Caroline,
Maxime on the other hand

35:49.915 --> 35:52.182
I mean look at her, oof.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.853
- No, no, no, Caroline,
Caroline, the woman

35:56.855 --> 36:00.157
with the light brown hair
sitting next to me at the table.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.592
- I dream of genie with
the light brown hair,

36:03.929 --> 36:08.298
only two syllables in genie
and Caroline has three.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.933
So there is no Caroline,

36:09.935 --> 36:12.235
only genie with the
light brown hair.

36:16.642 --> 36:19.576
- Alright guys he's drifting,
I need you to keep him

36:19.578 --> 36:20.677
focused on Maxime.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.381
- Doesn't Maxime turn you on?

36:29.421 --> 36:31.288
- Well she is a beautiful woman.

36:32.491 --> 36:36.426
- Ooh, what an innocent way to
express what you really feel.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.961
My mom would love you.

36:39.798 --> 36:42.432
Describe what you find
beautiful about her.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.572
- Her lips are so.

36:48.574 --> 36:51.441
- No not like that, speak
as you would in your first

36:51.443 --> 36:52.842
best-selling novel.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.247
- Shh.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.587
(dramatic music)

37:03.589 --> 37:04.921
- Where's Caroline?

37:04.923 --> 37:06.289
- No, Maxime!

37:07.659 --> 37:11.728
I don't want verbalized psycho
babble I want you to dictate

37:11.730 --> 37:14.564
what you want from
her right now,

37:17.836 --> 37:18.768
go.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.837
- He doesn't belong here.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.340
- Sure he does, look at him.

37:23.342 --> 37:26.309
- This didn't work before,
it's not gonna work now.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.378
- Now we're gonna get
down to the truth.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.683
- Maxime told me that
she really liked you.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.820
That she was you were
with another woman

37:36.822 --> 37:40.390
but she wanted you, so why not?

37:47.599 --> 37:48.515
She's not going to tell.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.432
- Caroline's the first
thing in New York

37:49.434 --> 37:52.269
my parents would
be proud of me for.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.837
- [Kentavious] I
don't understand,

37:54.806 --> 37:56.506
why isn't Stan taking it?

37:56.508 --> 37:59.476
- Because your method is fucked,
it doesn't prove anything,

37:59.478 --> 38:00.777
he's not our guy.

38:00.779 --> 38:04.681
- [Man] Yes he is, it's
definitely your guy.

38:08.320 --> 38:12.622
- I remember him, his
face, he was there.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.063
- Fine!

38:21.700 --> 38:25.068
We could've had something,
and not just you and Maxime,

38:25.070 --> 38:29.306
me too, we would've given
ourselves to you tonight.

38:29.308 --> 38:34.044
No one would've known,
you've got one last chance

38:34.046 --> 38:36.980
and then I'm gone, or is
it that I'm not your type?

38:38.317 --> 38:39.416
- No.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.685
Well that too.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.688
- I see, you want a
submissive bitch who takes it

38:44.690 --> 38:46.623
any way you give it to her.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.758
- Maxime's the very apex
of submissive right now,

38:48.760 --> 38:51.561
you don't see me jumping
at the opportunity.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.764
- No, you can't stay
apex or submissive,

38:54.766 --> 38:58.868
because apex means highest
or culminating point,

38:58.870 --> 39:01.771
and submissive comes from
(speaking foreign language),

39:01.773 --> 39:05.642
that means lowering,
so you got it wrong.

39:07.012 --> 39:10.980
What you meant to say is
the optime of submissive,

39:10.982 --> 39:11.948
didn't you?

39:12.851 --> 39:13.750
Didn't you?

39:15.587 --> 39:16.553
- I don't.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.888
(clapping)

39:24.763 --> 39:27.497
I didn't know why I
had been brought there,

39:28.533 --> 39:29.666
but I should have.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.404
(clapping)

39:38.043 --> 39:40.877
(dramatic music)

39:43.749 --> 39:45.615
- [Kentavious]
Congratulations Stan.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.787
- Are you Kentavious' friends?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.891
'Cause he's a swell chap.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.396
- [Kentavious] We were
wondering something,

39:59.398 --> 40:01.498
amongst ourselves so to speak.

40:02.601 --> 40:06.169
Would you happen to be familiar
with the name Alison Kane?

40:06.171 --> 40:07.604
(laughing)

40:07.606 --> 40:08.505
- Who?

40:09.608 --> 40:12.409
Who expostulate what
majesty should be,

40:12.411 --> 40:13.743
but beauty is.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.513
Why day is day, and night
is night, and time is time

40:16.515 --> 40:19.182
but be nothing but to
waste night, day, and time.

40:21.453 --> 40:24.721
- You are charming,
but now Stan,

40:24.723 --> 40:26.156
please answer the question.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.663
(sighs)

40:41.440 --> 40:44.774
- I don't know I
can kinda see it.

40:46.478 --> 40:50.647
I can sort of sense it, the
way you all came together.

40:52.050 --> 40:56.553
I envisioned Kentavious six
years ago on the first day

40:56.555 --> 41:01.558
of junior year, I will
denote you Nighthawks.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.961
(upbeat music)

41:04.963 --> 41:07.597
I will guess that upon his
arrival two years before

41:07.599 --> 41:10.200
at the prestigious Whitehall
University people didn't know

41:10.202 --> 41:13.470
what to make of
Kentavious, nor did he.

41:13.472 --> 41:16.606
He was an extraordinary musical
talent, and I have no doubt

41:16.608 --> 41:18.074
that he could've been
admitted to Julliard

41:18.076 --> 41:21.811
or the New England Conservatory,
but he never applied.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.180
Lack of confidence perhaps?

41:26.718 --> 41:28.518
(scoffs)

41:28.520 --> 41:30.019
- What does school have
to do with anything

41:30.021 --> 41:31.221
that I just asked you?

41:33.658 --> 41:35.058
- I think I know how.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.962
Instead Whitehall, a small,
elite liberal arts college

41:38.964 --> 41:41.564
wood him and there he found
himself, with the prospect

41:41.566 --> 41:44.100
of law school if the
music didn't pan out.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.702
In one such seminar on Bartok,
Stravinsky, and Schubert

41:45.704 --> 41:50.673
taught by his mentor is where
he first saw Maxime and Soo.

41:51.643 --> 41:55.011
- Good morning, I am God.

41:55.013 --> 41:58.014
I am informed this is
when I am supposed to

41:58.016 --> 42:01.251
write my name on the
blackboard but forget it,

42:01.253 --> 42:04.220
I will not write anything,
except maybe a quote or two

42:04.222 --> 42:06.556
to show a difficult transition.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.691
And close your notebooks
they are making me nervous.

42:08.693 --> 42:11.060
You will not be
writing anything,

42:11.997 --> 42:15.665
after all music is about what?

42:15.667 --> 42:16.900
- Listening.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.134
- Ah.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.670
- And then there was
you, Oliver Smithson,

42:21.673 --> 42:22.906
the most recent I'm guessing

42:22.908 --> 42:25.675
in a long line of
Smithsons at Whitehall.

42:25.677 --> 42:29.012
- So, to some up we've
uncovered how Stravinsky

42:29.014 --> 42:32.615
as a Dumbarton notes Concerto
E flat major took so much

42:32.617 --> 42:36.019
from Bach's Brandenburg
Concerto, yet forces us

42:36.021 --> 42:37.687
to look at these in a new way.

42:37.689 --> 42:40.590
Bartok and his
Concerto for Orchestra

42:40.592 --> 42:43.793
takes the classical sonata
structure of exposition,

42:43.795 --> 42:47.697
development, and recapitulation,
yet fills his form

42:47.699 --> 42:51.167
with traditional
Hungarian folk music.

42:51.169 --> 42:55.772
And again forces us
to a new recognition.

42:57.208 --> 43:00.944
- And that was the theme of
class, forcing recognition.

43:11.289 --> 43:14.023
(class chatter)

43:20.298 --> 43:23.066
- I don't know about you but I
did not hear the Brandenburgs

43:23.068 --> 43:25.702
in that Dumbarton at all.

43:25.704 --> 43:26.636
- What?

43:26.638 --> 43:27.370
- Kentavious right?

43:27.372 --> 43:29.772
I'm Oliver, nice to meet you.

43:31.276 --> 43:33.610
- Okay, nice to meet you.

43:33.612 --> 43:35.979
- So you settling
into the new year?

43:37.749 --> 43:40.383
- Sure, I'm having
a great semester.

43:40.385 --> 43:42.251
- Yeah, I hate college too.

43:42.253 --> 43:44.320
But you know what, I think
that just means people like us,

43:44.322 --> 43:45.989
we know bigger things lie ahead.

43:47.759 --> 43:49.092
- What are you talking about?

43:49.094 --> 43:50.159
- What's your major?

43:52.263 --> 43:53.730
- Musical theory.

43:53.732 --> 43:55.965
- No, what do you
really want to do?

44:00.739 --> 44:04.707
- I'm a singer, so I guess
I could make my own music.

44:04.709 --> 44:06.075
- I was hoping you'd say that.

44:07.045 --> 44:08.344
- Why is that?

44:08.346 --> 44:10.713
- I'm a mild Atterberg fan.

44:10.715 --> 44:13.082
So I bought a ticket to
the Ein Deutsches Requiem

44:13.084 --> 44:14.884
to hear the baritone solo.

44:14.886 --> 44:16.252
But when I got to
the symphony hall

44:16.254 --> 44:18.054
I ran into Munkacs who told me

44:18.056 --> 44:20.790
Atterberg's plane was
grounded in Toronto

44:20.792 --> 44:23.760
and his understudy
had food poisoning.

44:23.762 --> 44:25.662
So he had to drive to your dorm,

44:25.664 --> 44:27.997
pick up and take you downtown.

44:29.668 --> 44:31.734
That was really good
singing Kentavious.

44:32.704 --> 44:33.770
If I didn't know better

44:33.772 --> 44:35.271
I'd say that part
was written for you.

44:35.273 --> 44:37.674
- I can't believe you
actually know all that.

44:37.676 --> 44:39.175
I mean thank you.

44:39.177 --> 44:42.045
- Is that the kinda singing
you wanna do, the opera stuff?

44:44.282 --> 44:45.181
- No.

44:47.786 --> 44:49.919
I would actually like
to create my own genre,

44:49.921 --> 44:53.856
but honestly who wouldn't?

44:53.858 --> 44:55.124
- Tell me more about it.

44:57.796 --> 44:58.695
- I don't know.

45:00.699 --> 45:03.833
Something that would last
under repeated examination.

45:03.835 --> 45:05.001
- [Kentavious And Stan]
One that will cook and brew

45:05.003 --> 45:08.271
and result in a
product that has value

45:08.273 --> 45:12.308
- and which will be
recognize as beautiful.

45:12.310 --> 45:14.077
Even if no one
knows who wrote it.

45:15.847 --> 45:20.416
New, avant-garde but just right.

45:25.223 --> 45:26.856
- Music that makes an impact.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.259
- Exactly.

45:31.830 --> 45:36.365
- Well what about your
acapella group Tonal Recall,

45:37.502 --> 45:39.936
you able to work on
it with them at all?

45:39.938 --> 45:40.837
- Yeah.

45:42.474 --> 45:45.808
They don't really have the
same dedication that I have.

45:45.810 --> 45:48.211
- Well I'll tell you what,
I got this music idea

45:48.213 --> 45:49.479
that I've been working on.

45:49.481 --> 45:51.631
I'd love to run it by you.

45:51.632 --> 45:53.782
How about we go grab a
drink and talk about it?

45:54.986 --> 45:56.352
- You mean like right now?

45:57.789 --> 45:59.856
No way bruh I got class.

45:59.858 --> 46:02.291
- It's college, you're
supposed to miss class.

46:02.293 --> 46:04.393
Come on, you're not
gonna regret it.

46:04.395 --> 46:07.430
Where's all this coming from?

46:16.007 --> 46:17.874
- From that article
Rolling Stone

46:17.876 --> 46:19.776
did on your band five years ago.

46:21.279 --> 46:24.781
It talked about your strategy,
your ideals, all of that.

46:26.451 --> 46:28.317
And based on what I've heard
tonight it's not too hard

46:28.319 --> 46:29.919
to extrapolate the rest.

46:31.022 --> 46:33.790
- Good right on time.

46:33.792 --> 46:36.959
Kentavious I'd like for
you to meet Soo and Maxime.

46:36.961 --> 46:41.497
- Hi, nice to meet you.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.566
- Hi, I'm Maxime.

46:44.469 --> 46:46.035
- Welcome, take a seat.

46:46.037 --> 46:47.170
- Thank you.

46:47.172 --> 46:48.237
- [Oliver] You
didn't miss anything.

46:48.239 --> 46:50.907
(upbeat music)

46:56.815 --> 46:57.980
- So nice to see you
guys outside of class,

47:02.187 --> 47:03.452
where are you from?

47:03.454 --> 47:04.353
- New York

47:05.456 --> 47:08.558
by way of Paris for
me, and Seoul for Soo.

47:10.829 --> 47:13.229
- That's awesome how do you
like living in New York?

47:13.231 --> 47:16.199
- Funny, no one from the
city has ever asked me that.

47:16.201 --> 47:17.967
Constantly I tell
them that for me

47:17.969 --> 47:19.602
- [Soo And Stan] My childhood
wasn't so different.

47:19.604 --> 47:21.904
- I walked with the
nanny to and from school,

47:21.906 --> 47:26.976
did my homework, ate
dinner, then bed.

47:28.346 --> 47:31.447
- Growing up is what cities
like New York or Paris offer.

47:31.449 --> 47:32.949
It instills a sensibility

47:32.951 --> 47:35.351
that is more important
than learning.

47:35.353 --> 47:39.055
Making school so pointless
and interminable.

47:39.057 --> 47:44.126
- Ah yes, on the
impracticality of college

47:45.230 --> 47:47.363
for people like
us with the skills

47:47.365 --> 47:50.266
to survive in the
real world four years

47:50.268 --> 47:55.338
is a long stretch
of youth wasted on
slideshow presentations

47:56.007 --> 47:57.573
and half assed essays.

47:57.575 --> 47:59.008
Ironically I chose you all

47:59.010 --> 48:01.577
because you're over
qualified for school.

48:01.579 --> 48:06.649
Bold but bored and
idealistic, in a real rush

48:07.986 --> 48:10.386
to get to the real world,
to make a real impact.

48:10.388 --> 48:13.923
However I wanna remind
you college still provides

48:13.925 --> 48:18.027
a very important, very
unique opportunity.

48:18.029 --> 48:19.495
- What is that?

48:19.497 --> 48:24.166
- Well college helps you make
a real impact by bringing

48:25.536 --> 48:27.303
the impressionable masses
right to your doorstep.

48:29.073 --> 48:32.942
- He had you all entranced
like a cult leader

48:32.944 --> 48:37.146
or an evangelical might,
and he continues and he goes

48:38.283 --> 48:40.983
you know how to instill change?

48:40.985 --> 48:44.687
- You win the hearts and
souls of your constituents.

48:44.689 --> 48:47.590
We use pop to become popular.

48:47.592 --> 48:50.092
We still the bait and
switch model from the Betos

48:51.195 --> 48:52.695
and just like them we
don't stop at the music

48:52.697 --> 48:54.964
but we create our
own way of life.

48:54.966 --> 48:57.566
Now the band, that's
the easy part,

48:57.568 --> 49:00.636
see Kentavious here
is a terrific singer.

49:00.638 --> 49:02.071
- Whoa.

49:02.073 --> 49:03.005
- And if Munkacs
is to be believed

49:03.007 --> 49:04.941
he's an even better songwriter.

49:04.943 --> 49:06.175
Soo, Maxime.

49:06.177 --> 49:07.543
- I play violin.

49:08.646 --> 49:10.479
- And I used to DJ
in a club back home.

49:10.481 --> 49:11.714
- Really?

49:11.716 --> 49:15.017
- Yeah, I'm really
good at scratching.

49:15.019 --> 49:18.154
- Now becoming a successful
band is no longer a mystery

49:18.156 --> 49:22.258
it's a pretty simple
formula, and look at you,

49:22.260 --> 49:24.994
my beautiful group of eclectics.

49:24.996 --> 49:27.964
You guys are at 75% of
the work right there.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.334
And the last 25%,
that's where I come in,

49:31.336 --> 49:33.469
do some of my magic.

49:33.471 --> 49:34.670
- What magic exactly?

49:34.672 --> 49:39.041
- Legend has it that Kitt
Lampert, one of the producers

49:39.043 --> 49:41.377
of The Who took Pete
Townsend to the Royal Ballet

49:41.379 --> 49:44.413
where his father was once a
composer and his godmother

49:44.415 --> 49:46.415
was the prima ballerina.

49:46.417 --> 49:50.586
Kitt and Pete's takeaway
was that opera was a silly,

49:50.588 --> 49:54.724
archaic bit of nonsense that
needed to be reinvented.

49:54.726 --> 49:55.624
The result,

49:57.061 --> 50:01.197
the 1969 release of
Tommy, a rock opera.

50:01.199 --> 50:04.100
A culturally
transformative work.

50:06.037 --> 50:08.337
We build our audience now.

50:08.339 --> 50:11.774
We use all the free time
and free rehearsal space

50:11.776 --> 50:16.045
and performance opportunity,
Battle of the Band,

50:16.047 --> 50:18.681
talent show garbage things
we can get our hands on.

50:18.683 --> 50:22.385
We build up our voice and we
determine our own direction.

50:22.387 --> 50:24.653
I don't just mean creatively,
but I'm talking culturally,

50:24.655 --> 50:27.656
even politically,
so what do you say,

50:28.760 --> 50:30.393
got a couple of
pop songs in you?

50:30.395 --> 50:32.028
And don't worry you're
gonna be sneaking

50:32.030 --> 50:34.096
your John Lennon solo songs onto

50:34.098 --> 50:36.399
our platinum albums in no time.

50:36.401 --> 50:40.102
- Well, it does beat joining
the Young Republicans.

50:43.174 --> 50:44.140
- Sounds great,

50:46.044 --> 50:47.109
I'm in.

50:48.413 --> 50:53.049
Oh come on Stan you know
exactly who I'm talking about.

50:53.051 --> 50:55.418
The black girl in
the white dress.

50:58.222 --> 50:59.622
(party chatter)

50:59.624 --> 51:02.324
(dramatic music)

51:06.831 --> 51:08.197
- [Alison] Look who it is.

51:09.767 --> 51:11.167
- [Kentavious] Hey.

51:11.169 --> 51:14.670
- Hey, God you've
been gone for so long.

51:16.174 --> 51:17.473
But I made you coffee.

51:17.475 --> 51:18.307
- Yeah?

51:18.309 --> 51:19.208
- Yeah.

51:20.178 --> 51:21.277
- Thanks.

51:24.849 --> 51:27.083
- So, where you been,
I've been texting you?

51:27.085 --> 51:31.187
- I know I'm sorry, guess
I've been busy with my music,

51:31.189 --> 51:34.123
been putting a lot of
time into that band idea,

51:34.125 --> 51:35.224
you know the one I
mentioned to you?

51:35.226 --> 51:38.177
- Oh yeah.

51:38.178 --> 51:41.129
- I met this kid named Oliver
and wow, he's something else.

51:41.132 --> 51:44.400
He has some real ambition
in his ideas, he feels if

51:44.402 --> 51:47.136
we're able to catch the
following from millennials

51:47.138 --> 51:48.637
and get 'em hooked on our music.

51:48.639 --> 51:50.206
- Sounds riveting.

51:50.208 --> 51:54.276
- It is, I mean we've recorded
like three songs already.

51:54.278 --> 51:57.246
All written by me, yours truly.

51:57.248 --> 52:00.116
And then Oliver's on the road,
and he's doing his thing,

52:00.118 --> 52:01.317
he's booking us gigs.

52:02.487 --> 52:04.386
It's gonna be great.

52:04.388 --> 52:06.322
- Has Oliver explained

52:06.324 --> 52:08.357
how to make this
following actionable?

52:10.161 --> 52:11.193
- [Kentavious] What do you mean?

52:11.195 --> 52:13.229
- Like what's the
point of it all?

52:13.231 --> 52:14.396
- The point?

52:15.900 --> 52:19.235
Oliver is handling
everything okay?

52:19.237 --> 52:21.604
He said he just wants me to
focus on writing good music,

52:21.606 --> 52:23.606
and that's what I've been doing.

52:23.608 --> 52:26.342
- But you're still going to
Salzburg with Professor M?

52:26.344 --> 52:28.844
- Yeah, no we talked yeah,

52:28.846 --> 52:30.646
everything's still
good with Professor.

52:31.415 --> 52:32.815
- Oh good.

52:32.817 --> 52:34.150
- It's gonna be dope.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.553
- I hope so.

52:37.555 --> 52:40.723
(upbeat dance music)

52:46.697 --> 52:48.464
- Despite that Rolling
Stone only wrote about

52:48.466 --> 52:51.333
the Nighthawks because
of Oliver's initial pitch

52:51.335 --> 52:53.369
daylight Kentavious
failed to notice that

52:53.371 --> 52:55.638
Oliver just casually mentioned
they're greater goals

52:55.640 --> 52:57.940
only if their first few concerts

52:57.942 --> 52:59.775
were to begin to
attract attention.

52:59.777 --> 53:01.277
This is the scene of
their eighth concert

53:01.279 --> 53:04.413
in just a short while,
and afterward no one heard

53:04.415 --> 53:06.649
from Oliver about his
aspirations again.

53:08.186 --> 53:10.419
I don't believe Oliver was
malicious but instead riddled

53:10.421 --> 53:13.422
by the same disease that
plagues most millennials,

53:13.424 --> 53:16.659
a lack of concentration,
unable to see things through,

53:16.661 --> 53:20.262
preferring to not
face adversity, that
is why the Nighthawks

53:20.264 --> 53:22.298
would continue to go
from venture to venture

53:22.300 --> 53:24.567
without a serious plan for each,

53:24.569 --> 53:26.702
they never held
themselves accountable.

53:28.673 --> 53:32.341
(singing to techno beat)

53:44.255 --> 53:45.354
- Stan!

53:53.431 --> 53:55.931
- [Stan] In those early days
when Kentavious asked Oliver

53:55.933 --> 53:59.668
about his goals that Alison so
cared about, Oliver repeated

53:59.670 --> 54:02.538
that this goal would not
prove fruitful overnight.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.306
It required patience.

54:06.711 --> 54:10.346
- So what happens next, since
you know every damn thing?

54:14.318 --> 54:15.851
Here.

54:15.853 --> 54:16.752
- What's this?

54:18.356 --> 54:19.255
- Open it.

54:20.891 --> 54:21.790
- Okay.

54:26.697 --> 54:27.596
How?

54:27.598 --> 54:32.901
- The band is doing
great so, happy Tuesday.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.740
- Thank you brother,
happy Tuesday,

54:40.344 --> 54:41.577
so everything's going well?

54:42.680 --> 54:44.546
- Everything's going
better than well.

54:45.916 --> 54:47.650
You know we're really starting
to make a lot of money now.

54:48.519 --> 54:49.952
- But what about
the other stuff?

54:50.988 --> 54:52.655
- What other stuff?

54:54.458 --> 54:57.960
Come on, you know
that takes time.

54:57.962 --> 54:59.595
- But it's been awhile right?

55:01.365 --> 55:02.398
- Are you serious?

55:02.400 --> 55:05.934
I just gave you a real nice
gift and you're sitting up here

55:05.936 --> 55:07.336
grilling me about it now?

55:08.906 --> 55:12.074
- No, no I'm not.

55:12.076 --> 55:14.076
I'm not I'm just saying.

55:14.078 --> 55:16.545
- Think about it, you
think Bono would be Bono

55:16.547 --> 55:18.647
if he started doing all
his philanthropy work

55:18.649 --> 55:21.083
in the first six months
in the beginning of U2?

55:22.687 --> 55:23.519
- No.

55:23.521 --> 55:24.620
- Right, exactly.

55:26.791 --> 55:28.424
Writing these songs,

55:29.593 --> 55:33.095
having people listen to my
music and go crazy over it,

55:34.365 --> 55:38.467
that's my dream, and
that's what it's all about.

55:38.469 --> 55:40.469
And pretty soon they'll
be able to realize

55:40.471 --> 55:42.104
what real music is.

55:43.607 --> 55:44.807
(dramatic music)

55:44.809 --> 55:47.843
- Okay, thank you.

55:49.980 --> 55:50.946
- You're welcome.

55:51.949 --> 55:55.084
(upbeat piano music)

55:57.855 --> 56:01.423
(girls chatting softly)

56:15.373 --> 56:17.139
- Hey man that is really good.

56:18.409 --> 56:19.842
- Yeah?

56:19.844 --> 56:21.510
- [All] Yeah.

56:21.512 --> 56:23.045
- You know what?

56:23.046 --> 56:24.579
You should play that at
our show this weekend.

56:25.683 --> 56:28.650
- No way, it's not nowhere
near ready I can't.

56:28.652 --> 56:30.519
- Why not try it out, the
audience will tell you

56:30.521 --> 56:31.954
if it's ready or not.

56:31.956 --> 56:33.422
- Nah.

56:33.424 --> 56:36.525
- Yeah Kent please, can't
you see we're all sick

56:36.527 --> 56:40.662
of crowd pleasing, playing
the same mainstream music

56:40.664 --> 56:42.531
over and over again?

56:42.533 --> 56:44.600
- This is what we were talking
about at the beginning,

56:44.602 --> 56:47.603
the Beetles, Bob Dylan,
even Lady Gaga does it,

56:47.605 --> 56:48.837
you hook the audience,

56:48.839 --> 56:51.573
and then you slowly
shape their tastes

56:51.575 --> 56:53.542
with the more challenging stuff.

56:53.544 --> 56:56.044
And before you know it
the crowd is going wild

56:56.046 --> 56:59.648
for the weird, artsy stuff that
they woulda hated at first.

57:01.519 --> 57:02.184
Trust me.

57:03.821 --> 57:04.987
- You really think so?

57:05.856 --> 57:06.989
- [Oliver] I know so.

57:10.628 --> 57:13.862
(audience applauding)

57:18.002 --> 57:19.134
¶ Welcome to my fair ¶

57:19.136 --> 57:21.470
¶ It makes you feel so fair ¶

57:21.472 --> 57:23.806
¶ The crowd is dancing there ¶

57:23.808 --> 57:26.575
¶ Rocking everywhere ¶

57:26.577 --> 57:31.447
¶ That is long ¶

57:31.449 --> 57:33.549
¶ Rocking record square ¶

57:33.551 --> 57:36.452
¶ I will not care ¶

57:43.894 --> 57:44.827
Goodnight New York!

57:44.829 --> 57:47.729
(audience applauding)

57:51.869 --> 57:53.569
Y'all like that?

57:53.571 --> 57:56.171
Yeah I know you do, you
want another one don't you?

57:56.173 --> 57:57.706
(cheering and applauding)

57:57.708 --> 58:00.742
Yeah, well this is brand
new, no one's heard it before

58:00.744 --> 58:03.078
except you guys so let's go.

58:16.627 --> 58:18.760
¶ Gazing out on the planets ¶

58:18.762 --> 58:22.064
¶ She's looking at me blindly ¶

58:22.066 --> 58:26.635
¶ All has led me to this
moment to react properly ¶

58:26.637 --> 58:28.170
(crowd chattering)

58:28.172 --> 58:31.773
¶ Her resistance signals
that your time I'm assured ¶

58:31.775 --> 58:33.275
- [Woman] What's he singing?

58:33.277 --> 58:37.579
¶ Even the middle she donates
her time to the weekends ¶

58:37.581 --> 58:39.047
¶ Tells me this is goodbye ¶

58:39.049 --> 58:40.816
¶ But she's here with me ¶

58:40.818 --> 58:43.585
¶ And here without summer ¶

58:43.587 --> 58:45.521
- What is he doing?

58:45.523 --> 58:46.622
(chuckling)

58:46.624 --> 58:47.823
- [Man] What's
the wifi password?

58:47.825 --> 58:49.892
- [Woman] Let's just go.

58:57.535 --> 59:00.168
- Why did you rely on
the audience's validation

59:00.170 --> 59:01.670
to be proud of your vision?

59:03.240 --> 59:05.007
We all know that
doesn't end well.

59:13.250 --> 59:15.684
- Goddam spoiled brats.

59:15.686 --> 59:17.586
- [Oliver] I'm sorry Kentavious.

59:17.588 --> 59:21.023
- [Maxime] Oliver tell them,
we have 100k in gigs lined up.

59:21.025 --> 59:22.724
- Who wants to
experience that again?

59:22.726 --> 59:24.626
- [Maxime] You really
think that change happens?

59:24.628 --> 59:27.596
- No, I am not doing
that again, I'm not!

59:27.598 --> 59:30.032
- Okay fine, I
guess we're stuck.

59:30.034 --> 59:32.167
- Are you guys serious?

59:32.169 --> 59:34.703
Look at how far
we've come, no, no.

59:34.705 --> 59:36.838
No I'm telling you, so what?

59:36.840 --> 59:38.040
We always knew the band

59:38.042 --> 59:40.676
was just gonna be
step one in our plan,

59:40.678 --> 59:44.646
that it was gonna be
the stepping stone
to something better.

59:44.648 --> 59:46.248
So they didn't like our
new music, big deal,

59:46.250 --> 59:47.883
we always knew
that the next step

59:47.885 --> 59:49.651
was gonna require more patience.

59:51.155 --> 59:54.089
I think we're in the perfect
position to be influential.

59:54.091 --> 59:57.693
- Influential, are you
still pushing influence?

59:57.695 --> 01:00:00.262
I mean when we first started
you threw out some big ideas

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:02.864
but now we're raking in
the money it's almost like

01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:04.333
you forgot why I
chose to join this

01:00:04.335 --> 01:00:05.801
in the first place Oliver.

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:07.636
- What are you talking
about, because I pushed you

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:10.672
to perform a song that
you actually believe in?

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:12.674
No man, no matter
what happened tonight

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:14.710
our stock is as high
as it's ever been.

01:00:15.846 --> 01:00:18.680
Which is why I think it's
time to move on to phase two.

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:22.084
- What's phase two?

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:24.052
- [Oliver] You ever
heard of the Phantasm?

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:27.255
- No.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:28.690
- What the hell is that?

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:30.759
- It's a secret
society in Oxford

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.861
that poses as a
prestigious nightclub.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.297
When the club owners find

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:38.100
an individual that's
particularly interesting

01:00:38.102 --> 01:00:42.971
they put them through a series
of unorthodox interviews,

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.140
to find to everything
they can about the subject

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.676
and find out what
they're really made of.

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:48.910
- So what are you saying,

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:50.646
that we're gonna open
a club like that?

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.182
What about school,

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.752
you think I'm going to
drop out this semester?

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:58.053
You know I'm supposed
to go to Salzburg

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:59.354
and I'm not missing
that for anybody,

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.422
that could be huge for me.

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:03.892
- Maybe, but what
would really be huge

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:07.329
is for us to run a club where
the most elite people come.

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:10.399
I'm talking about being
at the center of culture.

01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:12.834
Making connections with
people that really matter.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.903
I mean that's what we
always talked about.

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:17.005
Look, we're big enough

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.074
that people are gonna
come to this club.

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:23.045
Now it's just on us to make
sure that they stick around.

01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:25.681
So,

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:29.818
what I propose is that
this week we announce

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.687
the band is breaking up.

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:34.923
That way anticipation is
gonna be through the roof

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:38.927
when we open the club, and
I guarantee you Kentavious

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:41.096
we have some fan that's
gonna come and bring

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:42.831
his muckity muckity muck dad.

01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:46.535
- [Maxime] Think about it Kent,

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.304
it could be a good move for
us, for you, for your career.

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:54.176
(dramatic orchestra music)

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:43.291
- I felt they abandoned the
band too soon, and did so

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:46.161
not because it was the right
moment, but because a hurdle

01:02:46.163 --> 01:02:47.329
was thrown at them

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:48.964
that a strong commitment
could've overcome.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.967
But they chose not to face it,

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:55.137
instead they convinced
themselves that the next venture

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:58.073
radically different would be
more satisfying and productive

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.374
than the one they chose

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:00.909
not to work through
'til its conclusion.

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:22.130
- Quite the negative
attitude Stan.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:26.535
- Just because one DA
came to your establishment

01:03:26.537 --> 01:03:29.104
didn't mean you created
the next Porcellian Club.

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:34.176
But look I'll give it to you,
your club really is something.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:37.045
It must've been back then.

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:39.881
- [Oliver] That is
the District Attorney.

01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:41.349
- [Maxime] Really?

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:44.052
- Well Kentavious, how about
we introduce ourselves?

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:45.887
- Let's.

01:03:47.024 --> 01:03:49.257
- Hello Mr. Blackwood,
my name is Oliver,

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:52.460
this is my friend Kentavious,
we are two of the proprietors

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:53.995
of this establishment.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:55.063
We just wanted to
come over here,

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:56.398
tell you how honored we are

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.500
to have you join us
on opening night.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.036
- Well I'm glad to be here,

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:02.871
and thank you for
your hospitality.

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:06.007
My son and his friends
are huge fans of yours.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:09.511
They were at the concert
in New Haven that you had.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.046
Now they're over
there hanging out.

01:04:11.048 --> 01:04:12.280
- Really?

01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:15.250
- Look, they told me
all about your goals,

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:19.054
it's great to see millennials
not just talking the talk

01:04:19.056 --> 01:04:21.022
but walking the walk.

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:25.060
- Wow, that really
means the world.

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:27.929
Why don't you have
them come over,

01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:29.631
we would love to share
drinks with them as well?

01:04:29.633 --> 01:04:31.499
- [Oliver] Oh of course, Rachel.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:38.440
- You give me a call if
you ever need anything.

01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:40.141
I'll be more than happy to help.

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:44.012
- Thank you, I
mean thanks a lot.

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:48.950
(dramatic music)

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.901
- [Stan] As the years passed,
303 rooftop brunches later,

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:08.637
the NightHawks refined their
club, created an extensive

01:05:08.639 --> 01:05:11.573
background check process
for potential interviewees

01:05:11.575 --> 01:05:14.009
and solidified the club
as the New York home

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:17.112
for the few, the
proud, and the hip.

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:20.448
But other than hefty
quarterly distributions

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:23.418
they had nothing substantive
to show for these years.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.987
Allowing the money to take
precedent over their goals

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:28.290
that had inspired them
just a few years before.

01:05:31.028 --> 01:05:34.696
- Good evening, and good morning

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:36.965
to all you degenerates
of the dark!

01:05:40.504 --> 01:05:43.705
- [Stan] An eternal state of
oblivious dissatisfaction.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:46.641
- Stop it!

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:49.678
You are the delitant.

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:56.184
Trying to dabble in
finance, writing, the arts,

01:05:57.487 --> 01:06:01.089
all of this just because
you'd rather go with the flow

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:03.158
than take some initiative.

01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:07.095
- Anyway, terms
like narcissistic

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:09.331
are used too freely these days.

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:12.534
And I suspect an objective
observer would describe Maxime,

01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:14.502
Soo, and Oliver in the same way.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:18.106
That their respective
upbringings rendered
each of them

01:06:18.108 --> 01:06:20.508
incapable of becoming
involved unselfishly,

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:23.078
and unsparingly in the
life of another person.

01:06:24.181 --> 01:06:27.015
Yet they found each
other, liked each other.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.218
Sort of Seinfeld but
without the laughs.

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:34.055
It seemed to make no difference
among the three of them

01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:37.359
they didn't even
notice, but Kentavious,

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:40.495
fundamentally vulnerable
became a victim.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:47.402
(upbeat club music)

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:55.777
- What the hell
are you doing here?

01:06:57.447 --> 01:06:58.713
- What a characteristically

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:00.515
loving thing to say
after all this time.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:04.152
I tried calling you and
you haven't answered.

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:06.454
And well, my well meaning shrink

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:08.256
thinks that I
should speak to you.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:13.395
- Well, if I didn't answer
than that obviously means

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:16.398
I was busy, right?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.267
- Doing what, choosing
seating arrangements for

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:20.702
the Euro trash that heard

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.670
that this was a hip
place in New York?

01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:25.673
- Yeah, sure.

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:34.182
- I was raped.

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:36.818
(dramatic music)

01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:41.656
- What do you mean?

01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:45.326
By who?

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:50.198
- It didn't just happen,
it happened six months ago,

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:55.270
and the entire investigation
was botched of course,

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:57.205
otherwise I would
spare you the news.

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:03.344
I didn't want to tell you
but I've run out of options,

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:05.847
all but one.

01:08:07.818 --> 01:08:09.184
- And what option is that?

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.687
- My shrink says
that I need closure.

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:17.826
For me that's identifying
what the campus cops

01:08:17.828 --> 01:08:22.596
called the perpetrator,
for me that's control,

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.564
and I need it.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:28.203
I've come to terms
with this pretty much,

01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:30.238
but I need to know who did it.

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:36.211
And it seems that your
enhanced interview technique

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:38.212
is the only way to get

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:41.783
the potential culprit
and interrogate him.

01:08:43.487 --> 01:08:46.421
For him, it will be a party,

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:51.658
but for us it will
be finding the truth.

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:58.433
We'll record it and we'll
forget about the campus cops.

01:08:58.435 --> 01:09:00.401
We'll hand it over
to the real police.

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:05.807
- Okay.

01:09:08.545 --> 01:09:09.444
Okay.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:14.182
Listen I need every name,
every number, every address,

01:09:14.184 --> 01:09:15.649
every detail, all infor.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.254
- This is all the information.

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.790
Everything I remember.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.701
- Caroline, is this her address?

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:36.404
- Yeah.

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:42.343
- Okay.

01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:47.314
I'm sorry.

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:49.850
I'm so sorry.

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:57.458
- Who is Alison Kane?

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:02.730
She's your sister isn't she?

01:10:04.968 --> 01:10:06.267
And you let her down.

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:10.405
- How do you know that?

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:15.376
- You just told me that.

01:10:18.682 --> 01:10:21.282
Clearly you've been
tormented by something.

01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:25.653
- What do you mean?

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:29.991
- You're angry that
you pushed her away

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:34.996
the last three years, because
all that time you knew

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:36.464
she was the only one
that could tell you

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:39.367
that you've in fact
accomplished nothing.

01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:42.537
And that you've allowed
Oliver to run how you live,

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:46.274
and how you work, and
who you are Kentavious.

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:50.011
You've been so caught up

01:10:50.013 --> 01:10:52.614
pretending to be
someone that you're not

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:56.351
you've forgotten about the
original goal to become someone.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:11:01.389
Take it from me, you still
wonder whether if you had

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:05.660
listened to Oliver's
goals all those years ago

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:07.028
if you'd even be here now.

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:10.999
Maybe if you'd stayed true
to your best intentions,

01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:14.269
who I believe you
are, you would've had
the presence of mind

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:17.372
to be there for her, protected
her, looked after her.

01:11:18.908 --> 01:11:20.942
Been the first person she
came to with this burden

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:24.379
but instead, she's coming to
you as a last resort isn't she?

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:30.752
When you're from what you're
from you don't have to be

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:34.789
omniscient to know that family
is the only thing in life

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.324
that isn't just noise.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:41.796
So this is what you needed
to do for your sister,

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:45.066
the meaning of which,
the importance of which

01:11:45.068 --> 01:11:47.468
you found and you studied.

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:57.412
You disappeared for
three months and then.

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:04.452
(talking)

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:08.790
(knocking)

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:10.558
- [Soo] Kentavious, welcome.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:14.862
- [Kentavious] How have
you been, what happened?

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:16.731
- Maxine] How have you been?

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:17.632
Welcome.

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:20.034
- Welcome back.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.672
So how do you like the bar?

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:26.941
You better like it
because you're a partner.

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:33.648
- It's nice, everything
you said it would be.

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:36.451
- Yeah a lot of pink,
your favorite color.

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:37.952
- Nice.

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:50.698
- What is that real?

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.866
- [Maxime] Let me see?

01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:57.138
- You ever thought about
actually taking somebody's life?

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:01.642
- What are you talking about,
taking somebody's life?

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:03.111
- I mean think about it,

01:13:03.113 --> 01:13:06.147
what if a guy escaped from
the police and you caught him

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:09.117
and you killed him,
should you feel guilty

01:13:10.453 --> 01:13:12.387
or should you actually
feel like a hero?

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:14.055
(dramatic music)

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:15.957
- I'm sorry am I
missing something,

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:18.092
we're talking about
killing somebody?

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.928
- I'm talking about protecting
the people that we love.

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:25.733
- What happened?

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:29.003
- Oh finally, a question
that our all mighty prophet

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:30.605
doesn't know the answer to.

01:13:31.841 --> 01:13:34.442
- Well we've been trying
to locate you everywhere.

01:13:34.444 --> 01:13:37.445
We called Alison, she didn't
even know where you were.

01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:38.579
- You called Alison?

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:42.483
(dramatic music)

01:13:44.487 --> 01:13:46.554
Alison was raped.

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:47.955
- [Maxime] What?

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:50.057
- Brother I am so sorry.

01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:51.192
- Now you're sorry.

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:54.529
Are you sorry that your
influence that you promised us

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:55.763
doesn't mean shit?

01:13:56.866 --> 01:13:59.066
Do you know I called the
DA to try to get help

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.903
for Alison and he didn't
even know who I was?

01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:03.638
What's the point of
doing all of this Oliver

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.573
if it doesn't mean anything?

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:06.791
- Where have you been man?

01:14:06.792 --> 01:14:08.008
Why didn't you tell
us any of this?

01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:09.577
- For the past three
months I've been trying to

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:11.746
help my sister man.

01:14:11.748 --> 01:14:14.582
The cops aren't doing shit,
nobody's doing anything!

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:16.684
I've been out
searching for leads!

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:18.619
- What did you find?

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:24.926
- I found someone, his
name is Chad Parrish.

01:14:24.928 --> 01:14:27.962
You remember Trey, our
patron from the club?

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:32.066
Chad was tagged in all the
pictures that Trey was in

01:14:32.068 --> 01:14:34.902
from the same frat party
that Alison was raped at,

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:37.138
he's the guy.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.609
- So what now?

01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:43.878
- I feel like we bring him in

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.113
for a good old
Nighthawks interview.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:50.551
At least that way we'll be able
to get the truth out of him.

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:59.026
- Okay so we bring this Chad
guy in, we have Marguerite

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.263
work her magic, we figure
out what really happened,

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:06.000
then we go to the police.

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:11.539
- She asked me if I wanted
a hand job, I said no,

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:13.741
I've got two hands for myself.

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.546
Hey.

01:15:18.548 --> 01:15:21.215
- Hello, oh that's
good, that's good.

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:22.984
- Good, yeah.

01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:25.820
(dramatic music)

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:48.543
- You find Maxime beautiful?

01:15:54.817 --> 01:15:57.585
(speaking foreign language)

01:15:57.587 --> 01:16:00.988
If she made advances on
you, you would accept them?

01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:06.561
- Yeah, sure,

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:09.630
why not?

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:10.765
- You work in a bank.

01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:13.868
(scoffs)

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:17.038
- I'm in private equity.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.109
- How private, how equitable,
don't you wanna do something

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:24.645
that really excites you?

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.685
- My considerable income
excites me plenty.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:37.892
- Yeah good one,
go on to the next.

01:16:43.366 --> 01:16:45.266
- You've never been in love.

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:54.675
- Only with the man
I see in the mirror.

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:59.046
- Why not someone beautiful
and sophisticated, hmm, say

01:17:03.653 --> 01:17:04.752
Maxime?

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:11.792
- I don't know.

01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:15.630
I just met her 10 minutes ago.

01:17:15.632 --> 01:17:18.666
- What if I told you
that she was telling me

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:21.268
before she sat down next to you

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:24.038
how cute she thought you were?

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:28.676
- Cute?

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:33.414
So

01:17:36.052 --> 01:17:39.220
Marguerite I heard these

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:45.826
interviews can get pretty crazy.

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:49.730
- Crazy, crazy how?

01:17:53.803 --> 01:17:55.069
- You know.

01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:55.970
- Hmm?

01:18:04.313 --> 01:18:05.780
- Are we done?

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:10.251
- No we are not done and
if you won't take Maxime

01:18:10.253 --> 01:18:14.455
right now like a red
blooded American boy

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:15.923
then we're gonna have
to arrange something

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:17.124
a lot less pleasant for you.

01:18:17.126 --> 01:18:18.759
- Take her, hmm?

01:18:19.696 --> 01:18:20.828
Who the fuck do you think I am?

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:23.064
- What do you think you are?

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:27.234
Well it wouldn't be the
first time your kind

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:29.036
took advantage of
a sleeping girl.

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:30.237
- One of my kind?

01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:34.341
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:37.878
- Oh, I apologize that I know
your fraternities ionic bond

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.715
formed over the extensive
knowledge of the chemical makeup

01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:43.484
of Rohypnol, ketamine, and GHB.

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:46.220
- Well fuck you very
much, I'd like to go now.

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.888
Where's the door, I'd
like to fucking leave,

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.156
this isn't what I signed up.

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:50.324
- Oh, so soon?

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:53.227
Chad.

01:18:55.465 --> 01:18:58.399
- Kentavious this isn't
right, okay let's wrap it up.

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:01.836
- Anything?

01:19:02.872 --> 01:19:04.238
- I don't recognize him.

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:10.411
- Well I didn't want to upset
you but people are telling me

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:11.879
that you had sex with a girl

01:19:11.881 --> 01:19:14.782
who was passed out
at a frat party

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:17.451
and we think that
was bad form so.

01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:24.859
- Do I look like the kind of guy

01:19:24.861 --> 01:19:27.027
who needs to fuck a
girl while she sleeps?

01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:33.901
- Alright, forget about
her, what about me?

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:39.940
Could you do it with a woman
awake looking you in the face.

01:19:40.877 --> 01:19:44.545
- Yeah he's lying, stay here.

01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:46.947
- Hey, hey, Kentavious
where you going?

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:50.818
- You did it, I know you
did it, don't you lie to me,

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.452
you raped her!

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:52.853
- Jesus Christ.

01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:54.522
- Everybody already
said you did it!

01:19:56.993 --> 01:19:57.542
- Did what?

01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:58.092
- [Kentavious] You
fucking raped her.

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:04.198
- I didn't rape anybody,
who the fuck are you man?

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.934
- Don't you worry
about who I am.

01:20:06.936 --> 01:20:11.205
What about the name
Alison Kane, ring a bell?

01:20:12.108 --> 01:20:13.474
And you're Chad Parrish.

01:20:19.949 --> 01:20:21.315
- You're Alison's brother.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:25.986
Shit.

01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:31.358
Listen man I'm really sorry

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.930
about what happened
to your sister

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.300
but it wasn't me.

01:20:39.302 --> 01:20:40.935
- You're lying, don't
you lie to me man.

01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:43.971
- No, no, I,

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:50.411
but I know who did, I
have a picture of him

01:20:50.413 --> 01:20:53.881
with your sister that night and
he was walking her upstairs.

01:20:54.917 --> 01:20:55.950
- [Kentavious]
You're fucking lying.

01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:57.918
- I'm not lying,
let me show you.

01:20:59.322 --> 01:21:01.989
- Kentavious put the gun down,
we don't know who did what.

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:06.093
- You better not be lying to me.

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:16.770
- Yeah.

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:18.137
That's your guy, that's Stanley.

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:21.242
- This is a lead alright,
we gotta take this

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:23.944
to the police and then
let them handle it.

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:28.415
- No, no, no, no
more fucking police!

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:33.487
- Please, if you give
me two days I will bring

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:36.056
this guy to you, I
will bring him to you.

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:36.957
- No, no

01:21:39.362 --> 01:21:40.961
we're gonna do this my way.

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:47.968
You're gonna gather all of
the information on this Stan

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:49.203
the same way we did for you,

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:52.106
and you're gonna
come here tomorrow

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:56.110
or else I'm gonna be
at your house Chad.

01:21:57.213 --> 01:22:00.381
And I promise I'm
not gonna be so kind.

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:06.120
Trust me, you're not
off the hook yet buddy.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:14.495
- Whoa, hey, hey, it
was Chad, it was Chad.

01:22:14.497 --> 01:22:18.032
- No, no, no, it was
you, you lied to me man.

01:22:18.034 --> 01:22:21.635
- I did not lie to
you, I didn't do it.

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:23.971
- Kentavious this isn't right.

01:22:23.973 --> 01:22:26.373
- No, we supposed to
be doing this my way.

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.075
It's supposed to be my way,

01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:31.078
and this is supposed to
be the guy, he's our guy.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.980
- Kent get a grip please.

01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:35.950
I know how bad you want
this guy to be the guy,

01:22:37.219 --> 01:22:41.956
but think, you heard him
explain what happened,

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:44.959
you heard him recite his poem.

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:47.461
You have seen him not
going for the bait

01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:50.998
with either Marguerite or me
when he was far too wasted

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.099
to hide anything.

01:22:54.337 --> 01:22:55.736
He is just as capable of doing

01:22:55.738 --> 01:22:58.973
what are you accusing
him of as you are.

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:02.276
- This isn't what
I asked of you.

01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:06.747
- Kent,

01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:11.452
it's alright.

01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:23.163
(dramatic music)

01:23:25.668 --> 01:23:27.034
- It was you.

01:23:30.106 --> 01:23:32.639
You looked wonderful that night.

01:23:41.517 --> 01:23:43.751
(sighing)

01:23:45.488 --> 01:23:47.488
Look Chad had just invited
me to come live with him

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:51.125
in his apartment, and he
thought I should loosen up,

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.527
so he asked me to go to
some alumni weekend with him

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.295
where I didn't
know anybody there.

01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:58.499
- [Alison] You look
really pretty tonight,

01:23:58.501 --> 01:23:59.400
I like how you did your hair.

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:00.367
- [Woman] Thank you.

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:01.168
- [Woman] Did we do the spin?

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.803
- [Alison] No, God no.

01:24:02.805 --> 01:24:04.171
- [Woman] Did he actually do it?

01:24:04.173 --> 01:24:06.073
- Well babe, remember
my first drink.

01:24:06.075 --> 01:24:07.641
- [Alison] Let me put this down.

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:13.213
- I was standing in a
corner awkwardly when a girl

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:15.349
who was inebriated
needed my help.

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:18.452
Hey, are you okay?

01:24:18.454 --> 01:24:21.121
I mean I'd be stumbling too
if I had to wear those heels.

01:24:32.301 --> 01:24:33.200
Whoa, whoa, hey.

01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:37.571
Why don't we just find
somewhere for you to lie down,

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:38.472
how about that?

01:24:46.148 --> 01:24:50.317
So I escorted her up the
stairs and I left her up there.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.188
It's my fault for not
thinking what could happen.

01:24:56.392 --> 01:24:58.325
Those guys vanished
on me after an hour

01:24:58.327 --> 01:25:00.527
and I thought they ran
off with their girls,

01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:02.396
but I had no idea it
was the same girl,

01:25:02.398 --> 01:25:03.664
Kentavious look at me!

01:25:06.102 --> 01:25:07.267
It wasn't me, okay?

01:25:09.205 --> 01:25:10.170
It wasn't me!

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.139
- Come on!

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:20.114
- [Stan] But I think you
know who it was, don't you?

01:25:20.116 --> 01:25:23.484
It was Chad, but
I should've known,

01:25:23.486 --> 01:25:27.821
Caroline should've known, that
night we were all complicit.

01:26:00.256 --> 01:26:02.523
- [Alison] Stan, you
need to leave now.

01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:20.541
- [Stan] Despite
everything that happened

01:26:20.543 --> 01:26:22.376
Alison did find her truth.

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:24.545
She got her closure.

01:26:26.215 --> 01:26:28.215
And to a degree so did I.

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:32.586
(police sirens)

01:26:33.889 --> 01:26:36.723
(dramatic music)

01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:51.565
(upbeat music)

01:28:56.632 --> 01:28:58.565
¶ I just need to ¶

01:28:58.567 --> 01:28:59.933
¶ I just need to ¶

01:28:59.935 --> 01:29:01.001
¶ Be ¶

01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:03.103
¶ I just need to ¶

01:29:03.105 --> 01:29:04.504
¶ I just need to ¶

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:05.639
¶ Be ¶

01:29:05.641 --> 01:29:07.007
¶ I just need to ¶

01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:08.342
¶ Be ¶

01:29:08.344 --> 01:29:09.343
¶ I just need to ¶

01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:10.477
¶ Be ¶

01:29:10.479 --> 01:29:12.746
¶ I just need to ¶

01:29:12.748 --> 01:29:14.081
¶ I just need to ¶

01:29:14.083 --> 01:29:15.882
¶ Be ¶
