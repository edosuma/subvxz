What makes a good T-shirt?
I think, erm...deceptiveness.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.160
So you look at a T-shirt and
you think, "Oh, that's Gucci,
isn't it?"

00:31.200 --> 00:33.800
If you look carefully,
it's Coochi.

00:33.840 --> 00:38.040
Dolce & Gabbana? No, mate.
Deepak and Gurdev.

T-shirts have you bought?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.880
This is the T-shirts here.
So I've got 6,000 of these.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.600

-Still feels weird saying that.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.760
Stop it! She's gone
to visit her lover.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.240
Lover? He's like 17 years old
and hands out flyers outside
a pub. He's hardly a lover.

01:35.280 --> 01:40.120

-Love is still the same whether

11:47.880 --> 11:52.200
It's a good point. Right,
we're gonna go and see her.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.840
-Now?
-Yeah, now.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.720
We need to sort this out,
Steve, I told you.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.040
Right, let me get a zoot for
the road. You not got Rizla?

12:01.080 --> 12:03.720
We'll get some at the shop.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.400
-Have you not got any?
-Steve, we don't have time!

12:06.440 --> 12:09.240
Pop yourself off.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.680
-Get out the way, it's my turn!
-It's not!

12:15.720 --> 12:18.880
-Get out the way, it's my turn!
-Stop!

12:22.040 --> 12:24.680
-Get out the way!
-You get out the way.

12:24.720 --> 12:28.600
You can go like this as well.
You're nan couldn't do that!

12:28.640 --> 12:32.360
-Whey! Backwards as well.
-Mate, what are you doing?

12:32.400 --> 12:35.160
[woman] She's really cute.
How old is she?

12:35.200 --> 12:38.240
She's not mine.
None of them are.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.840
[Grindah]
Oh, whatever, mate!

12:40.880 --> 12:43.360
Who do you think they
like more, you or me?

12:43.400 --> 12:46.640
"Oh, my child can't go on
the slide", or me, the one who
does it backwards, mate?

12:46.680 --> 12:49.480
You see that?

12:49.520 --> 12:52.560
I went on the thing backwards.
They'd never seen anything
like it.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.880
You killed it, man.

12:54.920 --> 12:58.840
Her nan could never do anything
like that in her pathetic
little life.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.880
Wooh!

13:00.920 --> 13:03.720
-There you go, bro.
-Oh, nice one.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.080
-[Decoy] Hey, there she is.
-There she is.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.520
Have you got the phone?
I need to call Beats.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.520
-He's not answering.
-He's probably mixing, man.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.200
Maybe.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.200
[Beats] If she has stopped
paying the electricity,
that is just proper selfish.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.640
-All right, Lorna.
-Happy Girl, We call her.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.680
-[door buzzes]
-Don't touch anything.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.760
Hi, Steve. How are you?

13:31.800 --> 13:33.800
Just normal, innit?

13:36.160 --> 13:42.080
Steve. I'm going to wait here.
Old people weird me out a bit.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.040
-In-and-out job with your nan.
-Right.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.880
"You're never too old to dream
big and seek new goals."

13:55.920 --> 13:59.040
Once you go past 40, mate...

13:59.080 --> 14:03.200
Do you know what I mean?
Give up, literally.

14:06.120 --> 14:10.520
-Oi-oi, Nanza! What's going on?
-Oh, what a surprise!

14:10.560 --> 14:14.160
-Didn't expect you.
-How you doing? All right?
What's going on? Good?

14:14.200 --> 14:16.720
-Lovely! Lovely!
-What are you lot saying?

14:16.760 --> 14:19.880
Ooh! I've got something
for you, actually.

14:19.920 --> 14:24.040
I was going to ask you something
as well. What was it?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.920
Keep 'em hidden.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.360
Nurse sorted them out for me.
They're mental.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.400
-Good, yeah?
-Yeah.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.160
Has he been on them?
He looks fucked.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.200
Oh, he's always away
with the fairies.

14:41.520 --> 14:46.080
Fire safety for people with
sight, hearing and mobility
difficulty.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.200
Good luck, do you know
what I mean?

14:51.280 --> 14:53.320
[Chabuds] Like playing
a little bit of footie.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.480
Pretty agile for their age.
They could be good workers.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.320
I might have a little butchers
see if they're up for
a bit of work.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.880
The thing is, with these kids,
you've got to relate to them,
you've got to impress them.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.760
Show them you know a bit
about footie. They used to
call me Bombay Becks.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.080
Hey, what's up? Do you
need another player?

15:10.120 --> 15:12.720
Let me see the ball, okay?

15:12.760 --> 15:16.080
I'll show you some skills
and that.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.000
Hey, listen, any of you lot
up for a bit of work, a bit
of cash-in-hand work?

15:28.040 --> 15:30.160
-[all] No.
-No?

15:30.200 --> 15:33.000
-Are you Mexican?
-No.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.800
-So you're not up for any work?
-No.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.120
All right.
You lot are shit, anyway.

15:39.160 --> 15:43.240
<i>I find it hard, man, these
kids don't want to work
any more, you know?</i>

15:43.280 --> 15:47.040
<i>Like, I was working from
the age of eight,
with a 'tache, you know?</i>

15:47.080 --> 15:51.360
These kids just want to lay
about on Chatroulette,
dicks everywhere,

15:51.400 --> 15:53.560
sending dick pics, you know?

15:53.600 --> 15:56.000
Snap-Snaps... What they into,
these kids?

15:56.040 --> 15:59.200
Nothing really, you know,
it's like, you know...

16:04.840 --> 16:08.160
-I might just have one...
-You all right, Steve?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.640
-Hello.
-Yeah, just...

16:10.680 --> 16:13.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just having
a little plate of biscuits.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.880
-Yes, thank you. All right?
-Lovely.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.840
-Really enjoying 'em. Thank you.
-All right, love.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.960
[Grindah] <i> When we met Steves,</i>
<i>he was like...</i>
[Beats] <i> No one.</i>

16:24.000 --> 16:29.320
[Grindah] <i> The kid used</i>
<i>to live with his nan. How</i>
<i>sad is that? We come along...</i>

16:29.360 --> 16:31.760
We, sort of, gave him the push
to get her out the flat.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.560
And we started pirate radio.
And now look at him now.

16:34.600 --> 16:38.680
He's got the fucking four
till five graveyard shift
on Kurupt FM.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.520
-DJ Steves. He used to
just be Steves.
-Yeah.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.760
-[Nan] That's for my back.
-Yeah, yeah.

16:49.800 --> 16:54.360
Nice little...nice little
burn at the back of the throat.
Yeah, it's good.

16:54.400 --> 16:58.200
-A little hint of wild berry.
-[they laugh]

16:58.240 --> 17:02.640
-Like she's talking
about wine, but it's drugs.
-Yeah, that's a good year that.

17:02.680 --> 17:07.520
-[posh accent] 1995 was
a very good year for pills.
-Yeah.

17:07.560 --> 17:11.839
[posh accent] 1995, is a...
No, I can't really do voices.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.839
Weeee!
[laughs]

17:18.880 --> 17:21.960
Angel!
[whistles]

17:22.000 --> 17:24.280
Come here, boy!

17:24.319 --> 17:27.520
There you go. See that?
Secret of parenting.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.640
They're basically like dogs.
Just give 'em sweets and they
just run around. It's easy.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.160
I'm killing, aren't I?

17:34.200 --> 17:35.920
[Angel] Weee!

17:35.960 --> 17:37.920
Come on, Beats mate.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.800
[mobile rings]

17:40.840 --> 17:44.400
-[director] Who's that?
-It's Grindah.

17:44.440 --> 17:48.320
Probably wants to know
why radio's not on.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.000
Are you worried?

17:51.040 --> 17:54.800
Yeah, a little bit, cos if
he gets back there and no one's
there, he'll be fuming.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.960
And we're not on air, so he's
gonna be even more fuming.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.120
Is it important for Kurupt
to stay on air?

18:02.160 --> 18:07.840
Yeah, of course. If you wanna
be London's leading, you can
literally never go down, like.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.400
[mobile rings]

18:10.440 --> 18:12.800
And again.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.560
[mobile rings]

18:16.600 --> 18:19.160
Just put it away.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.080
Out of sight, out of mind.

18:21.120 --> 18:25.760
-Where is Steve anyway though?
-[mobile rings]

18:25.800 --> 18:28.800
No. Still answer machine.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.120
We've got to get back.
I'm getting worried now. Angel!

18:32.160 --> 18:34.200
-We're going.
-Sweets!

18:34.240 --> 18:37.040
No, no more sweets.
We're going. Come on.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.480
See you lot in a bit, yeah?
Catch us up wherever.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.600
-This way. Eh?
-I want to play more.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.520
Oh, ooh! Life's not all about
fun, Angel. You've have
too much fun.

18:47.560 --> 18:52.440
If you have too much fun,
you can get a headache. Daddy
Grindah gets them all the time.

18:55.480 --> 18:59.400
[Steves] Cos people actually
have that voice in real life.

18:59.440 --> 19:03.800
Hello, nice to meet you.
Did you find out about
the electricity?

19:03.840 --> 19:07.600
Ah! That's what I was going
to do. Um, did you stop
paying the electricity?

19:07.640 --> 19:12.360
-Yeah, we got cut off.
-That's weird. We're on a meter.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.040
-The meter must have run out.
-No, it couldn't have, no.

19:16.080 --> 19:20.360
I rigged that meter with
a magnet. What's happened?

19:20.400 --> 19:23.960
Basically, all I know is,
I was plugging in my
new kettle

19:24.000 --> 19:27.480
-and I think a poltergeist...
-A new kettle, yeah?

19:27.520 --> 19:30.320
Well, you've blown a fuse,
haven't you, you daft twat!

19:30.360 --> 19:35.040
That's all it is. We should
go to the kettle and get
the fuse box out of it.

19:35.080 --> 19:39.680
Is the fuse box at Steves' flat?
Right, we've got to go.
It's the fuse box.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.480
-Come on, Steve.
-Sorry, Nan, I've got to go.

19:42.520 --> 19:45.360
'Ere, don't forget these.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.280
Oh, yes. You definitely
don't need these, yeah?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.960
No, no. You'll enjoy them
far more than I will.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.080
-Probably will, to be fair.
-Anyway, I can always
get some more.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.440
"Ooh, must have lost 'em.
So sorry."

19:56.480 --> 20:00.880
-No, I've got them here, Nan.
-Oh, no, you great idiot!
Go on, get out!

20:00.920 --> 20:04.320
-Bye, Steve's nan.
Nice to meet you.
-Bye, Nan.

20:04.360 --> 20:08.600
-She's all right for an "old".
-You wally!

20:08.640 --> 20:11.480
[Angel giggles]

20:11.520 --> 20:14.400
-What's going on?
-What's up?

20:14.440 --> 20:18.840
-It's not picking it up.
-Maybe it don't reach this far.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.640
Don't blame Kurupt FM cos
your shitty little radio
ain't up to it, bruv.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.360
I want sweets!

20:25.400 --> 20:28.240
Just have one, all right?

20:32.240 --> 20:35.240
If he gets back before us,
I'm fucked!

20:35.280 --> 20:38.720
-Yeah. Is that our bus?
-That's our bus!

20:38.760 --> 20:42.520
Let me get the whistle. Get
the whistle! [whistle blows]

20:42.560 --> 20:45.000
Got it from carnival.

20:45.040 --> 20:48.320
-Does that feel okay to you?
-Yeah, that's nice.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.640
-Is the temperature all right?
-Yeah.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.800
I've put on quite a lot of foam
so it gives a deeper
sort of...clean.

20:56.760 --> 21:01.320
Sorry. Just bear with me.
What are you doing here?

21:01.360 --> 21:06.600
-I've got to get back to radio,
so I've got to drop her off.
-I don't finish for an hour.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.400
I'm a bit early, but better
than being late, ain't it?

21:09.440 --> 21:12.360
-Hiya. Are you okay, Miche?
-Tanya.

21:12.400 --> 21:17.480
Sorry about this. Well, this
is my little girl, Angel,
who I told you about.

21:17.520 --> 21:21.280
And this is Grindah, who is
her dad and my boyfriend.

21:21.320 --> 21:25.880
-Oh, and that's just his friend.
-Just dropping off
the little 'un.

21:25.920 --> 21:31.360
Little tip for ya, just give
her loads of sweets every few
minutes and she'll be happy.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.400
-Really sorry about this.
-Sweet! See you later, girl.

21:34.440 --> 21:38.400
-Mummy's shampooing...
-Ha! Angel!

21:38.440 --> 21:40.800
She said "pooing"!
See you later.

21:40.840 --> 21:44.040
-[Angel] Pooing! Poo, poo!
-Hi, Angel.

21:44.080 --> 21:48.160
-Would you like to have
your nails done?
-Mummy said "pooing".

21:48.200 --> 21:50.440
Sorry, Tanya.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.600
Maybe just finish up there
and take a little break
or something.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.080
-If you just keep relaxing...
-You're a poo!

21:56.120 --> 21:59.240
-Tanya, I'm really sorry.
-It's fine. It's fine.

21:59.280 --> 22:03.600
-I think she's just had
too many sweets.
-Angel! Angel!

22:03.640 --> 22:08.080
All right, little man childs.
Listen, do you want to make
a bit of extra cash and that,

22:08.120 --> 22:12.240
for, like, your Myspace page,
maybe you want to pimp it out,
Facebook and that?

22:12.280 --> 22:15.040
-Excuse me.
-Hello...

22:17.440 --> 22:20.440
Come on, Steve mate.
Haven't got time.

22:23.560 --> 22:28.080
Bruv...
Bruv, do want any of these?

22:28.120 --> 22:32.400
Steves, we need to find the
fucking fuse box, mate. Where
did your nan say it was?

22:32.440 --> 22:36.880
Do you reckon the government
just gives old people, like,
drugs to try out on them?

22:36.920 --> 22:41.640
-Fucking hell!
-Cos if they die, it's not
suspicious circumstances.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.200
What's wrong with you? Grindah's
gonna be back any second,

22:44.240 --> 22:46.520
you fucking moron!
We need to find it, now!

22:46.560 --> 22:50.520
Quick! Don't you even care?

22:50.560 --> 22:53.600
I must just bosh a load
of these, cos I not even
feeling it right now.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.800
-Such a freak!
-What's it even look like?

22:56.840 --> 23:00.400
It's a box that has
electricity inside it.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.240
Have you checked these ones?

23:06.280 --> 23:10.480
I can't hear any of the tunes,
man. Don't point it upwards.
Don't film that bit.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.600
I'll look in the kitchen.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.920
You getting anything
in there, Steves?

23:18.480 --> 23:19.960
No.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.720
Get in, get in!

23:24.480 --> 23:26.840
Don't let me down, Beats mate.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.760
-[music plays]
-Easy boys, what's going on?

23:32.800 --> 23:36.400
Yeah, man. No, nothing.
All good. Everything
running smoothly, innit? Yeah.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.520
-Yeah? Nice, nice.
-Yeah.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.880
Get the old power back up
and running and that.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.360
-What?
-Yeah, what?

23:43.400 --> 23:46.000
-What?
-Nah...

23:46.040 --> 23:49.960
Steven, you're getting
slightly confused with
your new medication.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.600
Yeah, do you want to carry on
doing your record, babe?
Thank you.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.240
<i>It is really tough to
run Kurupt.</i>

23:57.280 --> 24:00.520
It's not that tough for me,
cos I'm naturally gifted.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.520
-It's backbreaking labour for
you, do you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

24:03.560 --> 24:06.040
Uh! Oh!

24:06.080 --> 24:08.000
Who...?

24:08.040 --> 24:11.240
Who changed the lumber
support on this?

24:11.280 --> 24:14.120
Who's been in my seat?

24:14.160 --> 24:17.960
I think Steves might have
used it earlier for his records.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.640
Steves mate! It's my seat.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.400
Beats knows that,
so he'd never touch it.

24:23.440 --> 24:27.440
Think I'm having my blackouts
again. I don't even
remember doing that.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.000
-[Miche] You all right?
-Easy. You good, yeah?

24:32.040 --> 24:34.680
Yeah, watch out cos Angel's
been sick on the carpet.

24:34.720 --> 24:39.000
-Probably all the excitement
she had today.
-She had, like, loads of sweets.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.360
It was like a big spray
of multiple-coloured jelly.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.080
Oh, not that bad then,
really, as sick goes.

24:45.120 --> 24:48.240
-She had a nice day, anyway.
-Nice day? Angel!

24:48.280 --> 24:52.040
Angel, did you say you
and Daddy had a nice day?

24:52.080 --> 24:54.800
-No, we had the best day ever!
-Yeah.

24:54.840 --> 24:58.160
Better than with your nana,
innit? Yeah, high-five!

24:58.200 --> 25:00.600
-She needs to sleep.
-There you have it, people!

25:00.640 --> 25:03.280
I am officially better
than your mum!

25:03.320 --> 25:05.960
-Probably get going.
-Cool, mate. Nice one.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.720
-See you tomorrow.
-Oh, man!

25:08.760 --> 25:12.520
That's actually put me
in a great mood, to be honest.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.400
[loud knocking on door]

25:21.560 --> 25:23.880
Whey-hey!

25:23.920 --> 25:26.360
Listen, I thought I'd come
and chat to Grindah,

25:26.400 --> 25:29.440
to see if anyone is up
for a little bit of work.

25:29.480 --> 25:33.400
Nah, they're all gone.
I've just been, sort of...

25:33.440 --> 25:36.320
Here on my own. Finishing up
for the night and that.

25:36.360 --> 25:39.080
I've just realised that I've
sorted out the entire
vinyl collection.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.040
It's all in order now,
alphabetical.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.520
[director] What do your
nan's drugs actually do?

25:44.560 --> 25:49.080
It just livens you up,
cos old people, they slow
down at that age.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.960
So if you aren't old
and then you do that,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.520
you've moving
at double the speed.

25:58.040 --> 26:01.720
Stevie, uh, what time
do you finish, mate?

26:06.800 --> 26:08.840
Roche.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.440
Roche.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.720
-You heard of these things
called 40-watt light bulbs?
-Yeah.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.760
Yeah, replace them up sometimes,
fuse boxes, whatever.

26:21.800 --> 26:26.280
Do washing machines. Whatever
you're after, really. Chill.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.760
-Anyone need a shit?
-[Craig] Already had two today.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.560
No, you go for it, love.

26:32.600 --> 26:37.240
Actually, I wonder if I...
left the bathroom light on
downstairs?

26:41.520 --> 26:46.640
Oh, you fixed it. Thanks, love.
Not just a pretty face, are you?

26:46.680 --> 26:48.760
Exactly.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.760
[Chabuds] It's amazing when
he's like this, you know?

26:51.800 --> 26:54.880
He's like...
He's like a machine.

26:54.920 --> 26:58.200
-And everyone just says he's
some brain-dead weirdo.
-Huh?

26:58.240 --> 27:03.920
Nah, nothing. I can't wait
for the world to see our
replica designer brands.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.120
Look at this.

27:06.160 --> 27:10.520
Limited edition Ralph Loren.
Polo, mate.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.040
-Jockey's bigger
than the horse on that.
-Exactly.

27:13.080 --> 27:16.840
-This guy is great.
-Dream job, innit?

27:16.880 --> 27:20.800
Stay focused, Stevie,
stay focused.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.960
-[toilet flushes]
-[Beats] She's finished.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.640
-How was it?
-Oh, get out of my house!
