00:02.168 --> 00:04.003
<i>[ Mac ]</i>
<i>He really has an ugly face.</i>

00:04.005 --> 00:05.337
<i>[ Dennis ]</i>
<i>Mmm, he does.</i>
<i>He is certainly ugly.</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:07.873
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>That's not really what</i>
<i>bothers me about this.</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:10.376
What bothers me is that he
looks like an old woman.
Right!

00:10.378 --> 00:12.578
<i>[ Dennis ] Yeah.</i>
<i>[ Mac ]</i>
<i>Well, he is wearing...</i>

00:12.580 --> 00:13.912
a lot of blush
on those cheekbones.
Right!

00:13.914 --> 00:16.849
But I feel like that
was the look of the times.
It's not just that though, Mac.

00:16.851 --> 00:20.386
It's not. I mean,
a lot of presidents somehow
end up looking like women.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.620
I mean, look at
Ronald Reagan. Right?
Mm-hmm.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.390
-<i> He looks--</i>
- Why would you hang a painting
like this on your wall?

00:24.392 --> 00:27.493
It's the historical society,
bro. They have to hang it up.
Right. Yeah.

00:27.495 --> 00:30.662
We gotta suffer just because
some old dude who looks
like Meryl Streep...

00:30.664 --> 00:32.931
chopped down a cherry tree
10 million years ago?

00:32.933 --> 00:35.934
It's just--
He looks terrible!

00:35.936 --> 00:37.569
You know what?
Let's take it down.

00:37.571 --> 00:41.540
It's just gonna distract us
through the meeting.
Yeah. Let's get it down, man.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.108
Let's take it down.
I'm gonna tear it down.

00:43.110 --> 00:46.779
<i>[ Mac ] It's gonna distract us.</i>
Unbelievable.
It's bolted to the wall.

00:46.781 --> 00:49.815
That proves our point, man.
We're not the first people who
tried to take that thing down.

00:49.817 --> 00:53.652
Yeah, but we're gonna be the
first ones to actually succeed.
Let's tear it down, Charlie.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.088
Let's just rip it
off the wall!
Whoa! Guys, guys, guys!

00:56.090 --> 00:59.992
I got a pocket knife.
Just cut it out of the frame.
<i>[ Dennis ] That's a good idea.</i>

00:59.994 --> 01:03.962
I've had enough of this dude.
Just cut it
right out of the frame.

01:03.964 --> 01:06.598
What are you doing?

01:06.600 --> 01:08.967
Oh. Uh--

01:08.969 --> 01:10.903
Do you want this up?

01:10.905 --> 01:12.438
Yes. Yes, I do.
<i>Really?</i>

01:12.440 --> 01:15.874
- Uh, may I help you gentlemen
with something?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:15.876 --> 01:19.578
Actually, we're here because
we want to get our bar certified
as a historic landmark.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.749
We want tourists to be able
to come by Paddy's Pub as part
of the walking tour of Philly.

01:23.751 --> 01:27.753
You know, they can come by,
soak up some history,
do some shots, get blasted.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.989
In order to be considered
as a historical site,

01:30.991 --> 01:34.793
your bar would have to have
some historical significance.

01:34.795 --> 01:40.132
Trust us when we tell you that
Paddy's Pub played an<i> extremely</i>
important part in history.

01:40.134 --> 01:43.068
Mm-hmm. And what part
of history might that be?

01:43.070 --> 01:46.472
The cracking of
the Liberty Bell,
of course.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.140
<i>So you're claiming</i>
<i>that your bar...</i>

02:21.142 --> 02:25.177
had a direct role
in the cracking
of the Liberty Bell?

02:25.179 --> 02:27.246
- Absolutely.
- Then tell me about it.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.816
Well, the year was 1412--
Oh, ooh. Oh, ooh, no.

02:30.818 --> 02:31.917
Really?
Let Dennis-- Let Dennis--

02:31.919 --> 02:34.686
-Let me tell the story, Charlie.
-Okay. [ Clucking Tongue,
Imitating Hoofbeats ]

02:34.688 --> 02:41.026
Yeah. The year was 1776.
And Paddy's Pub, then known,
of course, as Patrick's Pub,

02:41.028 --> 02:43.428
<i>was a hotbed</i>
<i>of revolutionary activity.</i>

02:43.430 --> 02:49.168
<i>Revolutionaries from all over</i>
<i>the country had come together</i>
<i>to gather at Patrick's Pub...</i>

02:49.170 --> 02:52.070
<i>to speak of war</i>
<i>and revolution.</i>

02:52.072 --> 02:54.273
Will you look at that?
Sons of Liberty--

02:54.275 --> 02:58.076
<i>patriots meeting in our bar</i>
<i>speaking of revolution</i>
<i>and freedom.</i>

02:58.078 --> 03:01.113
Can you believe it,
dear Brother? We're witnessing
history in the making.

03:01.115 --> 03:05.017
I do not give a shit, Deandra.
Now get me a flagon of ale.

03:05.019 --> 03:08.220
Get your own ale, dick.
Uh-uh!
You are my slave.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.855
You have to get me
flagons of ale.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.224
I saved you from being
burned at the stake
for being a witch!

03:12.226 --> 03:15.661
You're the one who
accused me of being a witch
in the first place, Dennis!

03:15.663 --> 03:17.563
Oh, well, what's done is done.
That's all in the past now.

03:17.565 --> 03:22.234
So you can either be a slave
witch in the bar or you can be
a burned-up witch outside.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.102
Up to you!
Flagon of ale now?

03:24.104 --> 03:28.273
Guys, guys, guys!
I've got some news.
I've got some terrible news.

03:28.275 --> 03:30.776
Oh, MacDonald,
how goes it?
Not good.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.844
You know that chick
I've been banging
down at Independence Hall?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.580
- Mmm, the fat one.
- Well, she's not that fat.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.848
She's pretty fat, dude.
Good one, witch. [ Laughs ]
Pretty fat.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.717
Well, whatever.
She told me
in complete confidence...

03:38.719 --> 03:41.720
that a bunch of old dudes
down there are drafting
a declaration--

03:41.722 --> 03:46.592
a declaration of independence.
Wait. Why would we want
to be free from the British?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.093
This declaration is gonna
start an all-out war.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.762
We have to make sure we are
not on the losing side!
Definitely.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.431
Okay, clearly the British
are gonna win this thing.
Clearly.

03:52.433 --> 03:56.602
All right. We have to make
sure that the crown knows
that we're on their side.

03:56.604 --> 04:00.172
We have to make
our own declaration.
Yes.

04:00.174 --> 04:04.876
Yes. We need to make
a declaration of dependence.

04:06.045 --> 04:08.814
[ Chattering ]

04:08.816 --> 04:13.752
Buy your pelts here.
We have raccoon.
We have foxes.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.288
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Ho there, sir.

04:16.290 --> 04:20.292
Now, my good gentleman, what
says you of my fine furs here?
Mmm!

04:20.294 --> 04:24.663
Merrily, I be able to guide you
towards some interest
in some purchase?

04:24.665 --> 04:28.267
I can't understand
what you're saying.
You wanna buy a fur?

04:28.269 --> 04:29.801
Yeah!
In July? No, thanks.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.638
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not so fast now.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.773
It's a nice-looking cart
of pumpkins you got here.
Mmm!

04:34.775 --> 04:41.313
Uh, what says you we maketh
some trade, hmm? All of my furs
for all your pumpkins?

04:41.315 --> 04:45.284
No.
All right.
I-I-I-I-I-I--

04:45.286 --> 04:47.185
One pumpkin.
Deal.

04:47.187 --> 04:50.222
All right then! [ Chuckles ]
Wait, wait, wait!
Whoa, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie!

04:50.224 --> 04:52.924
We're not traders, Charlie.
We're thieves.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.928
You want his pumpkins?
We kill him
and take his pumpkins!

04:56.930 --> 04:59.097
This is 1776!

04:59.099 --> 05:01.667
We'll get away
with it!
I can hear you.

05:01.669 --> 05:05.270
Yeah, all right. Very good.
This is how it will go down.
I will beat the man...

05:05.272 --> 05:08.907
about the face and the neck
and maybe the chest area
and possibly the groin--

05:08.909 --> 05:11.310
Eh?
until he's no longer
consisting of life pulse.

05:11.312 --> 05:16.648
And then you can collect up
the man's cart.
I shall findeth a stick.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.218
Yes! Well, we'll need
a stick to do the bashing.
Sit tight, sir.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.087
Pick a stick.
Any stick you like.
All right.

05:22.089 --> 05:25.957
Methinks the rod to be the most
suitable for our purposes.
Ahh! Very nice rod.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.860
Go with that rod.
Okeydokey-dokey-doo!
Uh-oh! He's gone.

05:28.862 --> 05:33.598
What! He stole our furs!
Yep. Yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep, yep.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.402
You shithead!
Hey, look on
the bright side, Franklin.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.871
We got ourselves
a pumpkin.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.674
<i>[ Dennis ]</i>
<i>This is gonna work.</i>

05:43.910 --> 05:47.713
[ Mac ] I can't believe
you dressed like that, bro.
Excuse me. This is a good plan.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.048
Okay? If we're gonna
get this declaration
into the hands of the queen,

05:50.050 --> 05:53.185
we need to dress the part.
That's not the way
the British dress, bro.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.321
They dress like this.
No. British commoners
dress like you're dressed.

05:56.323 --> 05:59.358
British peons. Okay?
I'm dressed like a nobleman,
okay?

05:59.360 --> 06:01.093
These people respond
to royalty.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.160
<i>[ Dee ]</i>
<i>Hey. Hey, guys.</i>

06:02.162 --> 06:05.997
- Come on. Please help.
- Just use your witch strength,
slave.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.367
Yeah. It's not
that much further. God!

06:08.369 --> 06:10.402
Uh, pardon me.
Pardon me, good sirs.

06:10.404 --> 06:16.174
Which of you gentlemen happens
to be the highest-ranking
military officer here?

06:16.176 --> 06:18.677
That would be me.

06:20.179 --> 06:23.448
Cricket.
Colonel Cricket.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.417
- Hmm.
- What is your business, sirs?

06:25.419 --> 06:31.156
<i>Ah, well, Colonel, we are</i>
<i>the owners of the fine local</i>
<i>establishment, Patrick's Pub.</i>

06:31.158 --> 06:33.992
Ahh. Patrick's Pub.
Yeah.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.961
Yes, of course.
Of course.

06:35.963 --> 06:39.731
The liberty bar, huh?
You harbor patriots.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.099
Oh, whoops.
No, no, no.
No!

06:41.101 --> 06:42.467
No, nayeth.
Nayeth.
Bad intel there.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.369
Yeah, bad intel.
Bit of a miscommunication.
Yes. Yeah.

06:44.371 --> 06:47.973
Actually,
that is why we're here.
Uh, we drew up this declaration.

06:47.975 --> 06:52.477
We also included
an illustration that we
had hoped would illuminate...

06:52.479 --> 06:55.280
our intentions
towards the queen, huh?

06:55.982 --> 07:01.019
This appears to be
a rendering of the two of you...

07:01.021 --> 07:02.821
sodomizing the king--
Huh?

07:02.823 --> 07:05.323
whilst the queen
is forced to witness.
<i>Oh!</i>

07:05.325 --> 07:08.427
Goodness gracious, no!
No! No! Look. I'm holding
homeboy's arms back.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.229
<i>Yeah.</i>
Dennis is ready
to jam him in the face.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.398
The queen is impressed.
Yeah. That's a bad guy.
That's not the king.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.334
-We're doing bad stuff
to the bad--
-Give me this. You don't get it?

07:16.336 --> 07:19.504
Let's get the ale. The ale.
Wench, now the ale.
Presenteth it.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.174
Okay, set that down
in front of him.
And yes, good Colonel,

07:22.176 --> 07:29.448
<i>we present this ale to you and</i>
<i>your men in hopes that it will</i>
<i>fuel the British to victory.</i>

07:29.450 --> 07:31.082
Madam.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.617
- Whoa! Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
- Come on!

07:32.619 --> 07:37.088
- Get out of here! You're making
things worse! Flee! Fly!
-<i> Get back to the bar!</i>

07:37.090 --> 07:39.391
I'm really sorry.
That was huge.
Yeah.

07:39.393 --> 07:42.627
- That hit you right in
the face, didn't it? Oh, man.
-<i> Yeah, you know what?</i>

07:42.629 --> 07:43.628
We don't condone
that sort of thing, okay?
No.

07:43.630 --> 07:48.233
We're gonna tar and feather
the shit out of her when
she gets back. Don't worry.

07:48.235 --> 07:52.270
I pray you,
who is that fiery wench?

07:52.272 --> 07:55.874
Her? Oh, that's just
my sister, Deandra.
She's our slave.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.042
Yeah. And a witch.
Yeah.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.912
- You keep your sister
as your slave?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Aye.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.448
[ Laughs ]
So are we good here now?
What's the deal?

08:03.450 --> 08:08.453
Gentlemen, you have both proven
to me in the very short time
that I have known you...

08:08.455 --> 08:10.989
that you are both
slanderous perverts...

08:10.991 --> 08:13.158
lacking any semblance
of moral fortitude.

08:13.160 --> 08:18.563
However, I do desire to seek
further counsel with the lady.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.500
The... lady?
Uh, the-- the witch?

08:21.502 --> 08:23.468
The same girl we've
just been talking about?

08:23.470 --> 08:26.805
You don't really think
she's a-- a witch, do you?

08:26.807 --> 08:28.974
Yeah. Yeah,
she's a witch.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.143
I-- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Pretty sure.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.845
All right, look.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.249
I wish to court her
in some manner,

08:37.251 --> 08:42.554
and I could use your help,
because I'm not, admittedly,

08:42.556 --> 08:45.156
very good with women.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.125
Good "with" women?
You mean, good<i> at</i> women?

08:47.127 --> 08:49.928
Like you can't catch them
when they run away from you?
Bro, it's 1776.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.164
They don't have any rights.
You can just take 'em and force
'em to do whatever you want.

08:53.166 --> 08:59.471
I do not wish to take her.
I would like to win her favor,
like a gentleman does a lady.

08:59.473 --> 09:01.039
That just does not
compute with me.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.240
I don't understand
what you're saying.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.911
Diggin' the accent
but don't understand you.
Are you saying you're gay?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.579
All right!
Escort them out!

09:07.581 --> 09:10.348
Oh, no. We-We-We-- Okay.
Are you gonna
drink the beer?

09:10.350 --> 09:11.983
No. Leave it. Out.
Just drink the beer.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.452
Maybe you'll get some balls
and you can take the woman.
Yeah.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.855
All right.
Well, I'm just saying.

09:20.626 --> 09:21.560
Higher.
Ready?

09:21.562 --> 09:22.360
Yes.
All right.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.030
Shoot.
One, two--

09:25.032 --> 09:26.331
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
three.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.501
Do not shoot
that pumpkin!
What are you doing?

09:29.503 --> 09:33.004
I stole a bunch of guns.
I'm testin' 'em out,
Charles.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.340
This revolution
is gonna make us a fortune.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.510
All right. Well,
leave the pumpkin out of it.
The pumpkin's innocent.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.478
<i>[ Frank ]</i>
<i>Shoot the pumpkin.</i>

09:40.480 --> 09:42.414
Do not shoot the pumpkin,
please.
Okay.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.182
Give me the gun.
Fine.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.984
And why is the witch slave
shooting at you anyway?

09:45.986 --> 09:51.089
- Maybe she used her sorcery.
- Sorcery? Your dumb dick
partner walked into the bar,

09:51.091 --> 09:55.327
said he stole a bunch of guns
and asked if I wanted to shoot
a pumpkin off his head.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.128
Of course I did,
so here we are.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.697
Damn your necromancy,
woman!
Oh, my God.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.967
Maybe if we shoot you,
you won't feel it anyway, witch.
Yeah. Shoot her.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.202
You know what? Okay, you guys.
I tell you what. You win.

10:04.204 --> 10:10.909
I'm a witch, okay? I'm a witch,
