Whoever thought walking in a circle at
two miles an hour would be draining?

00:08.468 --> 00:11.137
Fresh air, exercise.

00:11.262 --> 00:13.306
You know, some things
do have their negative sides.

00:13.431 --> 00:15.517
Our income just
got cut in half.

00:15.642 --> 00:18.061
And we get to spend
twice as much time together.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.647
More, if you don't leave
before your lunch hour is over.

00:20.772 --> 00:22.315

Just trying to do my job.

00:38.873 --> 00:42.127
Hey, relax.
Three more seconds and you can go.

00:44.921 --> 00:47.465
Are you telling
me what to do?

00:47.716 --> 00:49.300
It's okay.

00:50.343 --> 00:51.970
Just take a breath.

HOUSE: It's not my fault.
I don't use nurses.

02:02.665 --> 02:04.459
Cuddy was looking for you,
said she would send you down here.

02:04.584 --> 02:06.377
I know. That's why I'm here.

02:06.503 --> 02:08.671
Because Cuddy
hasn't found you yet.

02:08.797 --> 02:12.842
She's going to look everywhere
except the place she wants me to be.

- Hey.
- I've got an aortic dissection here.

lunches in front of you?

02:48.419 --> 02:50.380
Been here for two meals.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.507
- And you're happy with that?
- No.

02:52.757 --> 02:54.926
I just don't see much
use in complaining.

02:55.301 --> 02:56.719
Seriously?

02:58.388 --> 03:00.014
It's a pretty useful tool.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.767
You complain,
make people miserable.

03:03.393 --> 03:05.728
Then they do what you want,
to make the misery go away.

03:05.854 --> 03:08.731
We probably should say something.
Maybe I can call one of the doctors...

03:08.857 --> 03:10.775
They're doing their best.

03:14.904 --> 03:15.905
Ow!

03:16.030 --> 03:17.699
What the hell?

03:18.783 --> 03:20.994
I'm sure it was an accident.

He's a low priority.

03:25.665 --> 03:27.125
Is that a yes?

03:27.625 --> 03:30.461
- He's just...
- Happy-

before it spreads.

You guys are done.

carcinoma of the tongue metastasized

and we should all be back in the E.R.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.901
No, you're ignoring
the big symptom.

03:53.026 --> 03:57.530
What if we were looking at both the flu
and decent parenting.

03:58.448 --> 04:00.909
Okay, you two
are perfectly healthy.

04:01.034 --> 04:03.119
This guy wasn't pandering.
He wasn't vanilla nice.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.788
He was nice without any
aspiration of personal gain.

04:06.039 --> 04:07.665
I'm thinking genetic defect.

is a defect?

That last guy didn't last
long enough to procreate.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.932
And how long has the
patient been suffering?

04:24.057 --> 04:26.351
At least as long as his wife
has known him, eleven years.

04:26.476 --> 04:28.811
The chances of him having an undiagnosed
pathology for that long...

04:28.937 --> 04:30.146

04:30.271 --> 04:31.481
Evolution is wrong?

04:31.606 --> 04:35.109
(SCOFFS) Where do you think
we are? 21st century America?

04:35.234 --> 04:37.695
He's saying that
statistics are true, too.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.364
The world is a bell curve,

04:39.489 --> 04:41.699
most of us fall within
the standard deviation.

04:41.824 --> 04:43.034
But there are outliers.

04:43.159 --> 04:46.454
And if we believe in the existence
of extreme jerkiness,

04:46.579 --> 04:49.290
which I suspect that we do,

04:51.084 --> 04:54.170
then we also have to accept the
existence of the opposite extreme.

04:54.295 --> 04:57.632
You want it to be a symptom,
because then we're supposed to be jerks,

04:57.757 --> 05:00.051
which means you don't even
have to try to be nice.

05:01.427 --> 05:04.222
Okay, maybe I am biased.
Let's take a vote.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.891
Who thinks that niceness
is not a symptom?

05:07.976 --> 05:11.562
And who thinks that
their vote counts?

05:16.234 --> 05:19.195
You two, check out his home
for toxins. Taub and 31...

05:19.320 --> 05:20.363
31?

05:21.197 --> 05:23.950
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that
either way was good with you.

05:24.450 --> 05:28.287
Taub and Thirteen, MRI for tumors,
EEG for nerve damage

05:28.413 --> 05:31.207
and test whatever comes out of him
for everything else.

CHASE: Too much axis tilt.

05:47.390 --> 05:51.352
Don't release until your thumb's
at the bottom of the ball.

05:51.769 --> 05:53.438
I assume Wilson was busy.

05:53.563 --> 05:54.981
Again.

06:08.036 --> 06:09.996
No axis tilt.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.334
With Amber?

06:15.460 --> 06:16.419
Again.

06:16.753 --> 06:20.048
Still. It was nice of you
to invite me. This is fun.

06:22.050 --> 06:24.302
No, it wasn't.
No, it isn't.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.137
I didn't invite you to
be nice, I invited you

06:26.262 --> 06:30.099
because bowling isn't one of the two
things guys do by themselves.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.851
What's the second thing?

06:32.185 --> 06:34.020
Other hand.

06:38.024 --> 06:41.486
Well, if people are incapable of being
nice, why bother having the word?

06:42.278 --> 06:44.072
The ontological
proof of niceness.

06:44.197 --> 06:47.450
The existence of the word proves the
existence of the concept.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.536
Look out for those minotaurs
on your drive home.

06:50.870 --> 06:54.707
And I thought motives didn't matter,
only results mattered.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.126
So what are you gonna do?

06:57.460 --> 06:59.796
To screw up Wilson's relationship
so you don't have to listen to me

06:59.921 --> 07:01.464
while you bowl.

07:01.714 --> 07:06.594
I wish the best for them,
and their tragically deformed children.

She's good at being bad.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.390
(GUTTER BALLING)

07:11.599 --> 07:13.226
You might not be
able to destroy her.

07:13.351 --> 07:17.105
As long as I give it my best shot,
I can hold my head high.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.941
Cameron had this
one insufferable friend.

07:20.066 --> 07:23.236
She wasn't going to get rid of her,
and I sure wasn't going to join them.

07:23.361 --> 07:26.405
So I just said,
"See her on Thursdays."

07:26.531 --> 07:29.200
I know it's not as exciting
as an exploding birthday cake,

07:29.325 --> 07:33.871
but, hell, I don't want to hang out
with her every night anyway.

07:33.996 --> 07:38.334
That's amazing. Cameron only has
one insufferable friend?

07:55.726 --> 07:57.812
Joint custody.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.355
Of Wilson?

07:59.480 --> 08:01.858
Unless we have
another love child.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.693
Deal with him.

08:03.943 --> 08:05.820
He needs a mother figure.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.864
I'm not saying you're not entitled
to spend time with him.

08:08.114 --> 08:10.116
I'm just saying
I'm entitled, too.

08:11.033 --> 08:14.245
I don't know how to deal with him
when he's being reasonable.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.706
This is reasonable?
This is crazy.

08:16.831 --> 08:18.958
You're not a child,
you can make your own plans.

08:19.083 --> 08:22.128
No. Crazy is what House
would normally do in this situation,

08:22.253 --> 08:24.297
swap your lubricant
with super glue.

08:24.422 --> 08:25.464
The man knows me.

08:25.590 --> 08:29.051
This is his way
of accepting us.

08:29.177 --> 08:30.887
It's actually a very
touching moment.

08:31.012 --> 08:35.016
I'm proposing I get every other
day and every other weekend.

08:39.187 --> 08:41.272
I have Yoga Wednesdays,
you can have him then,

08:41.397 --> 08:44.108
but you have to have
him home by 11:00.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.571
We can swap weekends.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.865
Mondays and Wednesdays.
And midnight.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.659
If he's not home till midnight,
we won't be asleep till almost 2:00.

08:53.784 --> 08:56.078
Wilson, make a ruling.

08:56.204 --> 08:57.663
(LAUGHS)

08:57.788 --> 08:58.956
No.

08:59.081 --> 09:02.210
You two are like dogs circling
each other in the park.

09:02.335 --> 09:05.171
And I say that
with all the love in the world.

09:05.296 --> 09:07.298
You need to sniff
each other's butts, bare your teeth

09:07.423 --> 09:09.217
and arrive at some
strange dÃ©tente.

09:09.342 --> 09:11.636
Otherwise you'll
end up biting each other's eyes out.

09:11.761 --> 09:15.598
Again, with all the
love in the world.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.227
I'll let you sniff first.

09:19.477 --> 09:21.562
Take my deal or get
out of my apartment.

09:21.687 --> 09:25.650
Take my deal or I move in.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.700
This guy worked for Habitat
for Humanity in Costa Rica.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.619
And coaches handicapped kids.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.454
You think we should do a work up,
on the other coaches?

09:38.579 --> 09:40.206
It is possible
he's too perfect.

09:40.331 --> 09:42.458
I'm not saying he's perfect,
I'm saying he's trying to be.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.585
It's what people do.

09:46.212 --> 09:47.088
What?

09:47.213 --> 09:48.506
That's not what people do.

09:48.631 --> 09:52.218
People usually suck, but they
want to be good, want to be nice.

09:52.343 --> 09:53.678
House?

09:54.011 --> 09:55.763
Exception that
proves the rule.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.765
What sort of
argument is that?

09:57.890 --> 09:58.933
Bad one.

10:03.062 --> 10:04.981
That might be relevant.

10:05.606 --> 10:09.819
Hydrofluoric acid. Lowers his calcium,
causes the fainting and taste issue.

10:09.944 --> 10:12.029
But not the niceness.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.614
Wouldn't that be nice?

10:16.409 --> 10:18.577
You are King Solomon.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.872
If you want us to cut him in half,
we're cool with that.

10:21.998 --> 10:24.834
My boyfriend's too much of a wuss
to make the call for himself.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.336
And I mean that with
all the love in the world.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.923
I'm gonna piss off one of them.
And they both scare me.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.651
"Your treatment of patients
is reprehensible."

10:50.776 --> 10:51.902
You're reading his
performance review?

10:52.028 --> 10:54.530
I'm busy. We have
a nurses' strike.

10:54.655 --> 10:57.450
"Your management of employees
borders on abuse."

10:57.575 --> 10:59.160
Let's go.

10:59.452 --> 11:02.371
No, I...
I want to hear it.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.249
"You are overtly contemptuous
of hospital hierarchy."

11:05.374 --> 11:07.168
And covertly.

11:07.293 --> 11:10.004
But I suppose, you
didn't know about that.

11:10.129 --> 11:13.841
"Your attitude towards supervisory
personnel is disrespectful.

11:13.966 --> 11:17.178
"And a disturbingly large proportion of
your comments are racist or sexist."

11:17.303 --> 11:20.681
That top makes you look
like an Afghani prostitute.

11:21.015 --> 11:22.975
Would be an example of that.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.686
Sign this.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.855
- House, I got the...
- It can wait.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.191
I will sign if you
will give us a ruling.

11:30.316 --> 11:34.195
I will give you a ruling
if you do the reviews on your team.

11:37.239 --> 11:41.035
I'd be happy to continue
the mockery of this process.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.996
- What did you offer him?
- Wednesdays till 11 :00,

11:44.121 --> 11:45.039
and alternate weekends.

11:45.164 --> 11:47.875
Wednesdays till 11 :00,
and alternate weekends.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.837
Yes! Wednesday nights
are Ladies' Nights at Cheetah's.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.173
Calcium's normal.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.008
Wow. It really could wait.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.927
- Everything's normal.
- And you thought it wouldn't be?

11:58.052 --> 12:00.221
He's a carpet cleaner, he's got
a home full of hydrofluoric acid.

12:00.346 --> 12:01.931
Doesn't mean his
calcium should be low.

12:02.056 --> 12:04.392
Yeah, actually, it kind of does.
HF causes lower levels of...

12:04.517 --> 12:06.519
- Lower, not low.
- Lower than normal.

12:06.644 --> 12:08.354
Lower than yesterday.
Yesterday might have been high.

12:08.479 --> 12:10.356
What's lower than high?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.984
He actually has hypercalcemia,

12:14.110 --> 12:15.945
which is being lowered
to normal by the HF.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.614
So what gives us elevated calcium,
bad taste and fainting?

12:18.739 --> 12:20.032
I take it you know.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.326
Get the team.
This is gonna be fun.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.874
Hello, again.

12:28.999 --> 12:32.586
These people think
you're not too nice.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.713
Too nice? For what?

12:34.839 --> 12:37.800
For life as we know it to have evolved
without an intelligent designer.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.927
I'm going to
prove them wrong.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.096
Your wife is very ugly.

perfect or you're sick.

12:53.107 --> 12:54.942

sick is much more common.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.777
He's not sick. He's nice.

12:56.902 --> 12:59.864

is nice for making you breakfast.

wiring will let him do.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.034
He has Williams Syndrome.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.621

the genes that make him suspicious.

He doesn't think it's syphilis, but
he's gonna go run those tests anyway.

15:39.398 --> 15:42.151
Because he doesn't know,
that's why we do tests.

15:42.276 --> 15:44.862

Because he's afraid of you.

The bleeding's probably
from liver damage,

23:31.745 --> 23:35.373
probably caused by ethanol in
the cleansers or the penicillin.

23:35.499 --> 23:38.210
Two more probablies
than I like to hear.

23:38.335 --> 23:40.754

23:47.219 --> 23:50.639
Yes, I knew about
your issue with alcohol.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.808
Yes, I intentionally
got you drunk

23:52.933 --> 23:54.643
to provoke an argument,
between you and Amber.

23:54.768 --> 23:57.604
And why I'd do such a thing
is an interesting question.

23:57.729 --> 24:00.565
But what's more interesting
is that you knew as much as I did,

24:00.857 --> 24:04.778
and you're the one who's pouring down
the drinks. Why?

24:05.195 --> 24:07.656
Because I thought I was out
having fun with a friend.

24:07.781 --> 24:11.034
I didn't know the
drinks had subtext.

24:11.159 --> 24:14.162

24:21.461 --> 24:22.546
It's positive.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.673
Kind of assumed
he had protein.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.800
It's how much protein
he has that we care about.

24:26.925 --> 24:28.718
He's positive for syphilis.

a performance review?

24:31.638 --> 24:36.601

25:10.760 --> 25:12.721

25:12.846 --> 25:15.724
I assume from your omission of the word
"viral" before the "hep"

25:15.849 --> 25:17.684
that it's not another STD.

25:17.809 --> 25:20.687

sarcoid before the liver failure

25:20.812 --> 25:23.523

26:26.878 --> 26:29.756
We know. It's not just
a coincidence.

26:29.881 --> 26:31.299
Wilson says he's
always been a jerk.

26:31.424 --> 26:32.509
But he got worse.

26:32.717 --> 26:33.718
After his leg.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.428
The leg was a coincidence.

26:35.679 --> 26:38.056
Did you sleep with him?

26:42.894 --> 26:45.689
So what's going to happen?
What's gonna change?

26:45.814 --> 26:46.773
Maybe he'll be less of a jerk.

26:46.898 --> 26:48.525
Or less of a doctor.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.068
You gotta be a jerk
to be a good doctor?

Maybe House does.

26:51.903 --> 26:53.405

of their business.

26:57.575 --> 26:58.827
It's none of your business.

26:58.952 --> 27:02.497
I think the STD makes
it my business.

I'll get my shoes.

35:49.524 --> 35:53.069
Okay, got a good
view of the heart.

35:53.736 --> 35:59.158
What if we lower House's
dosage? Maybe stabilize him?

35:59.283 --> 36:01.410
He doesn't get worse,
he doesn't get better.

36:01.536 --> 36:04.664
Quite the line to walk. If we're wrong,
he dies of neurosyphilis.

36:04.789 --> 36:06.415
If we don't,
other people die.

36:06.541 --> 36:08.501
Other people
who aren't our boss.

36:08.626 --> 36:09.877
People.

36:10.503 --> 36:12.880
This sucks. The guy
had a gift. I killed...

36:15.216 --> 36:17.552
- Hi. What...
- House doesn't have syphilis.

36:17.677 --> 36:19.512
He switched
the blood samples.

36:20.304 --> 36:21.305
How do you know that?

36:21.430 --> 36:22.557
House told Wilson.

36:22.682 --> 36:25.518
I wanted to ruin
House's day. See you.

36:27.478 --> 36:29.480
- We're idiots.
- We're not idiots.

36:29.605 --> 36:31.274
Positive blood test
means positive blood test.

36:31.399 --> 36:32.692
Apparently not.

36:33.484 --> 36:35.486
There they are.
Let's see if they...

36:35.611 --> 36:37.738
What are you doing?
We're not done.

36:37.864 --> 36:39.490
He doesn't have syphilis.

36:40.241 --> 36:41.325
I know.

36:48.624 --> 36:51.919
KUTNER: Patient tested
positive for syphilis, right?

36:52.545 --> 36:53.921
Is this some sort of recap?

36:54.046 --> 36:56.632
But why did he test
positive for syphilis?

36:56.757 --> 36:58.759
Oh, oh, I know this.

36:58.968 --> 37:00.928
Either, one,
he has syphilis.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.138
I was gonna say that.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.265
Or two, the test
was wrong twice.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.768
Or three, he gave us
someone else's blood.

37:14.317 --> 37:16.277
- Who?
- Amber.

37:18.529 --> 37:22.617
Get that idiotic smile out of my face,
I gotta go on a killing spree.

37:22.909 --> 37:26.704
Or four, he has something that tests
positive for syphilis.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.790
- It's not Chagas.
- He worked in Costa Rica,

37:29.916 --> 37:30.958
before he was married.

37:31.334 --> 37:33.753
Is two a spree or do
I have to kill you too?

37:34.211 --> 37:35.838
Chagas wouldn't
explain the niceness.

37:35.963 --> 37:40.217
I've heard of remote tribes that
actually practice acts of kindness.

37:40.343 --> 37:42.970
Or the Chagas
caused encephalitis.

37:43.095 --> 37:44.221
The MRI showed no signs...

37:44.347 --> 37:47.099
Until we started him on steroids,
compromised the immune system

37:47.224 --> 37:48.517
and let the
infection flare up.

37:48.643 --> 37:52.188
I did another one.
It's not much.

37:55.191 --> 37:56.817
It's plenty.

37:58.736 --> 38:01.864
You figured this out
because I don't have syphilis?

38:03.616 --> 38:04.659
Damn.

38:06.285 --> 38:08.746
It should have
been my epiphany.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.043
Good news and bad news.

38:14.919 --> 38:17.880
Good news is,
we know what you have,

38:18.005 --> 38:21.717
it's treatable,
and you're going to live.

38:22.426 --> 38:24.136
Really?

38:24.261 --> 38:25.346
What's the bad news?

38:25.471 --> 38:28.849
The cure is a grueling
course of pills.

38:28.975 --> 38:30.059
It's like

38:30.184 --> 38:33.479
one a day for a month.

38:33.604 --> 38:35.648
Now you're just trying
to make me laugh.

38:35.773 --> 38:37.733
Yeah, like that's a challenge.

38:37.858 --> 38:39.360
You have Chagas disease.

38:39.485 --> 38:42.530
It's a parasite. It's been
asymptomatic for 10 years.

38:42.655 --> 38:45.741
Not quite. Your brain's been
swollen, not enough to see,

38:45.866 --> 38:47.410
but enough to alter
your personality.

38:47.535 --> 38:48.661
We're back to that?

38:48.786 --> 38:51.205
He screamed at you,
you don't think he can change?

38:51.330 --> 38:53.958
That was because of the drugs.

38:54.083 --> 38:57.294
So you think drugs
are more powerful than parasites?

38:57.420 --> 39:00.214
I mean, the ones we're gonna give you to
treat the parasites obviously are,

39:00.339 --> 39:03.843
but I stand by the principle.

39:03.968 --> 39:06.095
(JEFF BREATHES DEEPLY)

39:09.432 --> 39:11.767
I'm not worried.

39:11.892 --> 39:12.893
Neither am I.

39:15.104 --> 39:18.190
Neither am I. But that's
because I don't care.

39:34.123 --> 39:35.124
Reviews?

39:35.249 --> 39:37.960
It was brought to my
attention that, on occasion,

39:38.085 --> 39:40.212
I am not respectful
of hospital hierarchy.

39:40.337 --> 39:42.465
The word was "contemptuous."

39:49.138 --> 39:51.849
Well phrased, thoughtful...

39:54.935 --> 39:58.105
identically phrased.
These are all the same.

39:58.230 --> 40:02.651
Because underneath it all,
we are all the same.

40:02.777 --> 40:06.113
And Foreman refused
to type his up.

40:06.238 --> 40:07.531
Well, it's more
than I expected.

40:08.282 --> 40:10.242
There's an extra one in there.

40:20.211 --> 40:23.339
"Your treatment of patients
is nonexistent

40:23.464 --> 40:27.134
"because you're not a doctor,
you're an administrator."

40:27.259 --> 40:29.678
Foreman convinced me
that these could be helpful.

40:29.804 --> 40:31.722
"Your management
of employees is,

40:31.847 --> 40:35.142
well, let's face it, they're
outside carrying signs."

40:35.559 --> 40:38.979
The strike ended. The nurses have been
back for two shifts already.

40:39.105 --> 40:42.274
You'd think I'd have noticed.
What exactly did they do around here?

40:47.279 --> 40:52.618
"You act like employees should fear and
respect you, but your eyes tell us...

40:52.743 --> 40:55.621
"Actually your eyes tell us nothing,
because we're looking at your boobs,

40:55.746 --> 40:57.748
"which tell us that you're desperate
to have someone jump on you

40:57.873 --> 41:01.502
"and tell you they love you one grunted
syllable at a time.

41:01.627 --> 41:05.131
"What you want, you run away from.
What you need, you don't have a clue.

41:05.256 --> 41:09.510
"What you've accomplished
makes you proud.

41:09.635 --> 41:11.595
"But you're still miserable."

41:12.638 --> 41:14.390
Please sign.

41:16.892 --> 41:18.644
I got a call from Amber today.

41:18.769 --> 41:21.897
Says there's been
a violation your contract.

41:22.022 --> 41:24.817
You've been seeing
Wilson on her time.

41:24.942 --> 41:26.402
She breached confidentiality.

41:26.527 --> 41:29.655
You can let it slide,
Officer, we're even.

41:29.780 --> 41:33.159
Yes, you are.
You're both losing fingers.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.038
Look what I found.

41:38.164 --> 41:39.165
Nice.

41:42.835 --> 41:45.087
They think you might be able
to come home tomorrow.

41:45.212 --> 41:46.922
Yeah? That's good.

41:50.176 --> 41:51.218
What's the matter?

41:51.343 --> 41:54.680
The ketchup. There's something
wrong with that.

41:58.434 --> 42:01.228
Tastes fine.
ls there anything else?

42:01.353 --> 42:03.063
Everything else is great.

42:03.189 --> 42:07.443
I just, I don't know, I guess
I don't like ketchup anymore.

42:08.652 --> 42:10.905
Wonder what else I don't like.

42:29.089 --> 42:30.507
Roll over.

42:33.260 --> 42:35.012
We need a tougher punishment.

42:35.137 --> 42:37.890
You want to come over
to the poopy side?

42:39.225 --> 42:42.102
So where are you two
going Friday night?

42:42.228 --> 42:43.145
Dinner at L'Auberge.

42:46.941 --> 42:49.193
You're lying.

42:49.318 --> 42:50.277
Of course I am.
