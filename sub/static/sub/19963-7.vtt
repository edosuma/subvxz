00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:03.938 --> 00:06.405
(theme song playing)

00:08.809 --> 00:12.277
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.279 --> 00:14.713
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.715 --> 00:19.952
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:19.954 --> 00:22.955
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:22.957 --> 00:27.793
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i> who knows where ¶</i>

00:27.795 --> 00:30.662
<i>¶ And I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.664 --> 00:35.601
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

01:02.396 --> 01:06.598
Okay, boys.
Let's get to work.

01:12.206 --> 01:16.108
Rapunzel:
It's the first thing people see
when they enter the castle, Dad.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.011
I mean, maybe we could
remodel it or something,

01:19.013 --> 01:22.281
you know, make it
warm and welcoming.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.517
That archway
is an important line
of defense, Rapunzel.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.253
It is imperative it convey
strength and security.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.690
(mumbling)
You want strength and security,
here's what you do...

01:33.227 --> 01:38.363
Lion statues! Ooh, ooh,
better yet... turn the archway
into a giant lion's mouth!

01:38.365 --> 01:40.199
No, wait! Let's do
the whole lion--

01:40.201 --> 01:44.036
Thank you, Eugene.
I'll take those suggestions
under advisement.

01:44.038 --> 01:46.772
Ahh, teamwork! Up high!

01:48.275 --> 01:50.609
Your Majesty!

01:54.782 --> 01:56.315
Right! You're eating.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.616
We're eating.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.219
Next time, then. Cool.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.759
You know, Blondie, you might
wanna start coming up
with lion designs

02:07.761 --> 02:10.729
for that archway.
I think that idea
got some real traction

02:10.731 --> 02:11.997
with your dad.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.133
I'm sure the king
loved your idea.

02:14.135 --> 02:17.603
You do realize he was just
being polite, and probably
didn't wanna call you

02:17.605 --> 02:19.338
a nitwit to your face.

02:19.340 --> 02:23.642
Cass! If my dad didn't like
Eugene's ideas, I think
he would just say so.

02:23.644 --> 02:27.412
Yeah. And he's never been shy
about calling me names
to my face before.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.780
(groans)

02:28.782 --> 02:30.182
Well, before you go

02:30.184 --> 02:33.152
and have your royal advisor
nameplate made up,

02:33.154 --> 02:36.355
you should probably know
that whenever the king
wants to ignore an idea,

02:36.357 --> 02:39.658
he always says,
"I'll take it under advisement."

02:39.660 --> 02:44.663
Ha! Shows what you know!
I clearly remember
him saying, "I'll"...

02:44.665 --> 02:49.368
Take those suggestions
under advisement.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.969
(thunder cracking)

02:50.971 --> 02:55.140
-Oh, no! He does
think I'm a nitwit!
-And there it is!

02:55.142 --> 03:00.112
This changes everything!
I cannot have a father-in-law
who doesn't take me seriously!

03:00.114 --> 03:02.514
Why not?
No one else
takes you seriously.

03:02.516 --> 03:06.652
That's not true, Eugene.
My dad thinks very highly
of you.

03:06.654 --> 03:10.355
Though, maybe
there are times you could
be a bit more selective

03:10.357 --> 03:12.391
about the kinds of things
you suggest to him.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.693
He is the king, after all.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.461
<i>Et tu, </i> Blondie?

03:16.463 --> 03:19.831
Okay, you know what?
It's fine. It's fine.
I can fix this.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.900
Quick! Name things
your dad likes,

03:21.902 --> 03:24.736
that I can pretend
I also like to impress him!

03:24.738 --> 03:27.906
-(bells sounding)
-The emergency alarm!

03:36.383 --> 03:39.418
Equis?
As in the kingdom
next door, Equis?

03:39.420 --> 03:40.419
Mm-hm.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.688
What's that got to do
with my dad's statue?

03:42.690 --> 03:44.423
Why is it all messed up?

03:44.425 --> 03:49.361
Your dad's lifetime rival,
King Trevor of Equis, likes
to play pranks on him.

03:49.363 --> 03:52.431
By just drawing a silly face
on Dad's statue?

03:52.433 --> 03:55.667
I can't imagine
any intelligent person
finding this funny.

03:55.669 --> 03:59.605
(laughing)

04:00.908 --> 04:02.774
(coughs)

04:02.776 --> 04:06.545
Anyway, King Trevor always
manages to thoroughly
embarrass your father.

04:06.547 --> 04:11.083
I can hear you, Captain.
And yes, I am embarrassed.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.019
Embarrassed for him!
Really! The very idea

04:14.021 --> 04:18.090
of a grown man partaking
in such infantile boobery!

04:18.092 --> 04:21.026
-I still don't get it.
-I'll explain later.

04:21.028 --> 04:25.130
Trevor has been trying
to lure me into partaking
in his shenanigans

04:25.132 --> 04:26.231
since our youth.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.899
Well, I won't partake!

04:27.901 --> 04:29.735
Do you hear me, Trevor?

04:29.737 --> 04:32.437
I won't partake!

04:32.439 --> 04:35.073
(crows cawing)

04:35.075 --> 04:38.910
I must partake!
I can't take this embarrassment
any longer.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.479
Ooh, I need a prank!

04:40.481 --> 04:41.747
I must show the people that,

04:41.749 --> 04:43.615
despite that sign's
proclamations,

04:43.617 --> 04:46.151
Equis does not rule!

04:46.153 --> 04:48.420
I agree, but how?

04:48.422 --> 04:50.389
Yes, how?

04:51.392 --> 04:57.095
By striking against
that which he holds
most dear!

04:57.097 --> 04:59.631
The very symbol of his land!

04:59.633 --> 05:02.501
You mean, the Seal of Equis?

05:02.503 --> 05:06.305
But, Your Majesty,
the castle of Equis
is impenetrable.

05:06.307 --> 05:11.143
In fact, only one man
has ever successfully
infiltrated its defenses.

05:11.145 --> 05:15.681
-And he--
-(Eugene whistling)

05:18.585 --> 05:20.018
You guys talkin' about me?

05:22.423 --> 05:24.256
Blondie, great news!

05:24.258 --> 05:27.759
Your dad just asked me
to steal the Royal Seal
of Equis for him!

05:27.761 --> 05:30.429
Stealing from Equis?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.864
That doesn't sound
like a great idea.

05:32.866 --> 05:36.802
Did you know that they have
over a thousand guards on duty
at any given time?

05:36.804 --> 05:39.788
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
but don't you see?

05:39.789 --> 05:42.773
It's the perfect way for me
to prove to him I'm more than
just some nitwit thief!

05:42.776 --> 05:45.444
By stealing something?

05:45.446 --> 05:47.346
-No.
-(Pascal squealing)

05:47.348 --> 05:49.481
By stealing something well.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.450
(squeals,
groans)

05:51.452 --> 05:54.886
-Hm.
-Hey, come on, it's
for the official royal prank!

05:54.888 --> 05:58.557
I'm pretty sure that makes it
completely legal...ish.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.058
Oh! Well, then let me
come with you.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.527
I'm pretty good
at surprises.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.563
Sorry, Blondie,
but I've assessed the situation,

06:04.565 --> 06:06.465
and this is a one-man job.

06:06.467 --> 06:10.469
Luckily, Flynn Rider
does his best work alone.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.870
Let's go, partner!

06:11.872 --> 06:13.739
Wait! I'm sorry,
you wanna come with me?

06:13.741 --> 06:17.476
Of course I'm coming with you.
You think I'm in the habit
of dressing like this?

06:17.478 --> 06:21.413
Though this new,
dashing adventure suit
I had made is quite slimming.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.850
I must witness
Trevor's humiliation
first hand!

06:24.852 --> 06:27.219
Ohh... yeah.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.987
See, um, ha-ha.

06:28.989 --> 06:32.657
The thing is, I was thinking
you wanted, you know,
me to do it alone.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.659
Uh, not that I wouldn't love
to have you along.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.862
It's just, you probably
have way more important--

06:36.864 --> 06:39.531
This is a matter
of national pride, son.

06:39.533 --> 06:44.236
Of course it's important.
And I specifically said "we"
would steal the Royal Seal

06:44.238 --> 06:47.572
-of Equis, remember?
-I do! I do re-- yes,
you did say "we"!

06:47.574 --> 06:51.576
I thought you were using
the royal "we," you know,
being king?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.412
Come on, let's do this!

06:53.414 --> 06:56.515
How'd you put it before?
Teamwork! Up high!

06:58.252 --> 07:01.153
Yeah. You know,
when you say "Up high,"
you usually--

07:02.122 --> 07:04.122
Okie-dokie,
never mind.

07:06.393 --> 07:09.494
(crows cawing)

07:15.536 --> 07:18.804
So, Your Majesty,
I've drawn up this map

07:18.806 --> 07:22.741
based upon the brilliant way
I got into Castle Equis before,

07:22.743 --> 07:25.110
to show you how this
is gonna go down.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.814
All we need to do
is borrow a couple
of uniforms

07:28.816 --> 07:31.049
and waltz right through
the front door.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.651
-Eh?
-We're not doing that.

07:32.653 --> 07:36.655
-We're not?
-Eugene, as king I've received
top military training.

07:36.657 --> 07:40.392
After studying this map,
I can say with certainty
that what is required here

07:40.394 --> 07:42.627
is stealthy ingress.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.564
And this is the perfect spot
to do it!

07:46.733 --> 07:48.400
The northeast tower?

07:48.402 --> 07:51.136
The heavily guarded,
impossibly fortified
northeast tower?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.672
No one will expect it.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.410
(crows cawing)

07:58.412 --> 08:01.480
Mmph, what's so fun
about pranks, anyway?

08:01.482 --> 08:03.515
Mostly, the look
on the other person's face
when they realize

08:03.517 --> 08:04.850
what's happening.

08:04.852 --> 08:08.320
So, it's supposed
to surprise people?

08:08.322 --> 08:13.091
Well, it's more like a joke.
But, only the person responsible
for it thinks it's funny.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.927
Oh. So, like the jokes
my dad tells.

08:15.929 --> 08:19.431
No-oo. There's more to it
than that.

08:19.433 --> 08:23.635
You need to get somebody
to expect one thing and then
do something unexpected instead.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.638
It's basically entertainment
for morons.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.673
Hmmm.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.643
Unexpected, eh?

08:31.645 --> 08:34.012
(snoring)

08:34.014 --> 08:39.351
By the time he wakes up,
he'll be so well rested
he won't even know what hit him!

08:39.353 --> 08:42.053
(laughs)
I can't wait to see
the look on his face.

08:42.055 --> 08:46.258
-Unexpected, but not clever.
-(distressed squeaking)

08:49.329 --> 08:51.496
All is clear.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.765
Just follow my lead.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.474
Your highness.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.477
Ohh, whew.

09:05.479 --> 09:06.711
Huh?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.416
Hmm.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.019
-Aah!
-(smacking sound)

09:14.021 --> 09:15.086
Ah-huh-huh.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.259
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.661
Oh, boy.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.595
Huh!

09:23.597 --> 09:26.064
-(horse whinnying)
-Get over...!

09:28.001 --> 09:31.603
(chuckles nervously)
fellow guards.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.373
Yes!

09:35.375 --> 09:39.411
There. See? Easy.

09:39.413 --> 09:43.448
Eugene, I thought
I said the guard uniforms
were unnecessary.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.785
Come on! Mm-hm? (chuckles)

09:46.787 --> 09:49.087
Oh, yeah, no,
don't mind me.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.623
I'm just gonna scream
into this for a little bit.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.959
(muffled screaming)

09:59.600 --> 10:01.700
-Ooh!
-Quiet, Eugene.

10:01.702 --> 10:05.637
-(grunting with pain)

10:14.247 --> 10:16.815
Okay. Just follow my lea--

10:16.817 --> 10:18.817
-(loud grunt)
-Really?

10:18.819 --> 10:20.952
-What was that?
-Better check it out.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.289
(coins clinking)

10:24.291 --> 10:25.824
This way!

10:27.961 --> 10:30.595
They didn't spot me. A-ha!

10:30.597 --> 10:31.896
Let's move out!

10:31.898 --> 10:35.767
Ahhh!
You love Rapunzel,
you love Rapunzel,

10:35.769 --> 10:37.836
you love Rapunzel!

10:37.838 --> 10:40.739
All I'm saying is,
if you bring a quiche to work,

10:40.741 --> 10:42.474
you should bring enough
to share with your co-workers.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.909
-That's-- Just--
-Yeah, but, you don't even
like quiche!

10:44.911 --> 10:46.845
Yeah, but that's-- First of all,
don't tell me what I don't like.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.680
No, I know
you don't like quiche.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.915
Okay, because I-- I like
a lotta things, but you
never point that out.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.684
-(sighs) Uh-huh.
-You just tell me
all the stuff I don't like.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.086
-Yeah.
-Anyway, let's just
get this done.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.756
Okay, you start cleaning
the spears, I'll work
on the swords.

10:57.758 --> 11:02.360
(cabinet doors rattling)

11:05.599 --> 11:07.132
Ha! Gotcha!

11:07.134 --> 11:08.199
(screams)

11:11.204 --> 11:15.006
Ha! I just polished
all of these weapons
before you could!

11:15.008 --> 11:17.308
You should see
the look on your face!

11:17.310 --> 11:20.612
-(shaking metal)
-You've just been pranked!

11:20.614 --> 11:23.715
Or as it's soon
to be called, Rapunzelled.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.953
That was clever.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.722
But not funny.

11:33.827 --> 11:37.062
Ahhh. The royal seal room.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.732
-How do you like that, Eugene?
Told ya! (slapping back)
-Ooh!

11:40.734 --> 11:42.467
Flawless plan.

11:49.376 --> 11:54.813
Ahhh. Behind that curtain
lies the Royal Seal of Equis.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.918
Oh-ho-ho, sweet revenge!

12:03.023 --> 12:05.857
(barking)

12:05.859 --> 12:11.396
-It's a seal.
-Indeed. The Royal Seal...
of Equis!

12:11.398 --> 12:16.768
-(barks)
-It's a seal seal!
Not a royal seal!

12:16.770 --> 12:20.004
It is a seal seal
owned by a king!

12:20.006 --> 12:22.273
Thus, a royal seal.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.743
(barks)

12:24.745 --> 12:27.612
-Hmm?
-You have got to be kid--

12:27.614 --> 12:29.514
Y-- You know what?
You know what?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.583
At this point, never mind!

12:31.585 --> 12:33.852
Just grab your end
and let's get outta here.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.054
(grunting)

12:36.056 --> 12:37.622
Yoo-ahh!

12:38.925 --> 12:42.026
-(King chuckling)
-What? What? What
are you doing?

12:42.028 --> 12:46.464
Leaving a calling card,
so Trevor knows it was I
who did this.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.099
What should I paint, hm?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.435
Eye patch? Stink lines?

12:50.437 --> 12:53.438
Perhaps a tear, representing
his imminent humiliation

12:53.440 --> 12:55.573
at being bested by me.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.042
No! None of those things
should you paint!

12:59.312 --> 13:01.379
Let us go now!

13:01.381 --> 13:03.314
(barking)

13:09.389 --> 13:12.290
(barking continues)

13:12.292 --> 13:15.660
Oh, I'm gonna need
your grappling hook.

13:15.662 --> 13:16.895
(doors thrown open)

13:24.104 --> 13:26.604
You're the expert.
What are we going
to do now?

13:26.606 --> 13:29.941
Oh, oh, so when you say "we,"
do you still mean
the royal "we,"

13:29.943 --> 13:32.110
which is actually you telling me
how to fix this?

13:32.112 --> 13:35.079
King:
Well, no. I'm saying "we"
as in us.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.915
Eugene:
Is that the royal us,
because it still sounds

13:36.917 --> 13:38.249
like it's just me.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.685
I asked you to come
so that "we" could get the seal.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.922
Okay, okay, now I'm confused.
You said "I" and "we"
in the same sentence,

13:43.924 --> 13:45.640
which I'm finding
means the same thing.

13:45.641 --> 13:47.357
Not to mention
the fact that I couldn't
get the proper definition

13:47.360 --> 13:48.493
of seal from you!

13:48.495 --> 13:50.094
(yelling and barking)

13:50.096 --> 13:52.430
(crashing)

13:52.432 --> 13:54.432
-Huh? Uh-oh.
-(laughs)

13:54.434 --> 13:56.000
Uh, hey, guys.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.036
Hey, you guys.
Would you believe

13:58.038 --> 14:00.171
that we're
the chandelier repairmen?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.874
(laughs)
Repairing in the middle
of the night?

14:02.876 --> 14:04.843
'Cause this thing is broken.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.578
(barking)

14:10.517 --> 14:11.683
(sighs)

14:11.685 --> 14:15.353
Well, this prank
has gone horribly awry.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.956
Listen, I'm sorry
I lost my cool.

14:17.958 --> 14:22.327
It's just, this whole prank
was my big chance to get you
to take me seriously.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.162
Take you seriously?

14:24.164 --> 14:27.632
Yeah. And I was getting
frustrated when I wasn't able
to do that.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.069
I know. It was dumb.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.976
You know, there are many things
I fail to take seriously.

14:37.978 --> 14:44.215
Eugene... son, you brought
my daughter home to me
after 18 long years.

14:46.052 --> 14:50.255
If there's one man
in the whole world
I take very seriously,

14:50.257 --> 14:51.923
it's you.

14:51.925 --> 14:56.094
Wow. Thanks,
Your Majesty.

14:56.096 --> 15:00.198
Can I ask then, why-- why
didn't you listen to my ideas?

15:00.200 --> 15:04.002
You know, I suppose sometimes
I let good ones slip through
the cracks.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.405
I should've given your plan
more consideration.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.910
What you should have done
was stayed in your own
kingdom, Frederic!

15:13.914 --> 15:15.446
Trevor.

15:15.448 --> 15:20.018
Your efforts to abscond
with my sweet Trevor Jr.
were comical at best.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.720
Oh. Yeah?
Well, I don't think
your seal's too happy there.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.956
(whimpering)

15:24.958 --> 15:27.625
Of course he's not!
The poor little darling
is traumatized

15:27.627 --> 15:29.060
by what you did to him!

15:29.062 --> 15:31.062
All right, Trevor.
You've had your laughs.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.563
Now, release us.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.532
Oh, I'll let you go,

15:34.534 --> 15:38.102
but not until I parade you
through town in nothing
but a jester's hat,

15:38.104 --> 15:42.073
proving once again
that Equis is superior
to Corona!

15:42.075 --> 15:47.812
For now, I leave you here
to wallow in the stench
of your own defeat.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.481
(chuckles)

15:52.719 --> 15:55.286
(sighs)
Trevor's right.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.955
Oh, come on,
you don't smell that bad.

15:56.957 --> 16:00.275
Plus, it's mostly seal.

16:00.276 --> 16:03.594
I meant, I deserve
to wear nothing
but a jester's hat.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.631
Uh, Your Majesty?
What the heck does King Trevor
know, anyway?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.167
Once again,
he showed himself

16:09.169 --> 16:12.103
to be
the more accomplished prankster.

16:12.105 --> 16:15.506
Accomplished?
His prank wasn't even funny!

16:15.508 --> 16:18.743
I mean, I laughed, a little.
But still, all around,
not that funny.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.246
Yes, that's true.
His pranks are always
more grating

16:22.248 --> 16:23.748
than they are humorous.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.986
Totally grating. Hey. Hey.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.488
-That's it!
-What's it?
What are you doing?

16:30.490 --> 16:33.191
I'm gettin' us outta here.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.728
The question is,
are you willing
to try it my way?

16:42.202 --> 16:43.735
(grunts)

16:48.475 --> 16:49.540
(frustrated neigh)

17:08.528 --> 17:12.296
Ha! Gotcha!
You should see the look
on your face!

17:12.298 --> 17:15.099
(whinnying and clapping)

17:21.174 --> 17:22.640
Did you see the look
on his face?

17:22.642 --> 17:26.377
He expected one apple,
but then he got a whole bunch!

17:27.380 --> 17:30.148
Best. Prank. Ever.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.516
(whinnying)

17:31.518 --> 17:34.218
Funny. But not mischievous.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.159
Eugene:
<i> Will you just listen,</i>
<i> Your Majesty?</i>

17:41.161 --> 17:43.494
<i>There's no way you'll escape</i>
<i> that way!</i>

17:43.496 --> 17:46.497
Hey! What's goin' on
in there?

17:46.499 --> 17:48.833
Fellas! Would ya look at that?

17:48.835 --> 17:51.669
The king, he escaped without me.

17:51.671 --> 17:55.339
I don't know if I'm
more impressed or insulted.
You know what I'm sayin'?

17:55.341 --> 17:57.241
Open the door!

17:57.243 --> 17:59.710
Oh, no, King Trevor's
gonna have our necks
for this.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.145
Lose something?

18:02.248 --> 18:03.481
(smack)

18:16.729 --> 18:19.864
Quickly, if we go back
the way we came,
he might not see us.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.099
Wait.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.369
Follow my lead.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.371
(inhaling and exhaling)

18:31.211 --> 18:34.045
Well, well.

18:34.047 --> 18:37.515
It appears someone
hasn't learned their lesson yet.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.285
Okay, okay, look, you got us.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.654
This one is completely
our fault.

18:45.291 --> 18:49.060
Ooh! Yes!
Uh, we wanted to pull
some sort of prank

18:49.062 --> 18:52.330
so that all this
wouldn't be in... vain.

18:52.332 --> 18:56.300
Uh, really?
And, and what were you
gonna do in there, pray tell?

18:56.302 --> 19:00.171
Well, I thought it'd be funny
to slip into the library
and rearrange the periodicals.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.973
Historians hate that.

19:01.975 --> 19:06.811
That is the worst idea
for a prank I have ever heard!

19:06.813 --> 19:11.182
And in true Coronan fashion,
you would've failed! Again!

19:11.184 --> 19:14.185
That's the real door
to the library!

19:14.187 --> 19:15.953
Uh, no, nope.
No, it's not.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.356
I'm pretty sure
this is the library.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.492
You imbecile!
This is my castle!

19:21.494 --> 19:23.628
I know where my library is!

19:23.630 --> 19:25.329
Meh! Agree to disagree.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.598
I'll prove it.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.933
You see--

19:28.935 --> 19:30.201
(screams)

19:30.203 --> 19:31.335
(thud)

19:31.337 --> 19:33.137
(laughs)

19:33.139 --> 19:36.607
Forgot about your own
top-notch security
for a second, didn't ya?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.976
Well played, Eugene!

19:38.978 --> 19:41.512
Very well played!

19:41.514 --> 19:44.649
Up high.
(chuckles)

19:44.651 --> 19:46.184
Yeah!

19:46.186 --> 19:49.453
Trevor:
Let me up, Frederic!
There's spiders down here!

19:49.455 --> 19:52.223
Spiders! (screams)
One just touched me!

19:52.225 --> 19:53.324
(seal barks and claps)

19:53.326 --> 19:55.326
Trevor:
Trevor Jr.,
are you clapping?

19:55.328 --> 19:57.495
Those had better
be claps of sorrow!

19:57.497 --> 19:59.363
Would you look at that.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.033
I've finally humiliated Trevor!

20:02.035 --> 20:04.035
Oh, Your Majesty!

20:04.037 --> 20:08.139
We have not yet begun
to humiliate that guy.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.378
-(slapping on back)
-(grunts)

20:14.380 --> 20:15.479
Ahhh.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.714
Both:
Huh?

20:19.185 --> 20:21.052
Eugene:
Oh, my.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.654
Gotcha, Dad!
(laughs)

20:23.656 --> 20:27.225
Oh, man, you should see
the look on your face right now.

20:27.227 --> 20:31.829
Well, I suppose it's fine.
As long as you girls
repaint the archway.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.665
-By nightfall.
-(laughs)
Obviously, Dad.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.467
Of course, Your Majesty.

20:38.371 --> 20:41.405
Well, Raps, you finally
figured out this whole
prank thing.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.540
Yes!

20:42.542 --> 20:46.611
It was unexpected, clever,
funny and mischievous,

20:46.613 --> 20:50.915
but you overlooked
one of the most important parts
of any good prank.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.351
You didn't think it through.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.755
We both still have
to repaint the archway
by nightfall.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.523
Remember?

20:59.525 --> 21:02.760
Sorry, but I've got
princess duties to attend to.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.630
Looks like you're
gonna have to do it
all by yourself.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.765
Still believe I didn't
think it through?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.241
Kidding!

21:17.243 --> 21:19.410
You just got pranked!
(laughs)

21:19.412 --> 21:21.112
I totally got you!

21:21.114 --> 21:23.281
You should've seen the look
on your face!

21:24.484 --> 21:26.317
I just got Rapunzelled.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.253
Well played, Raps.

21:29.255 --> 21:32.023
Very well played.

21:36.296 --> 21:41.432
Well, Your Majesty,
did you do it?
Did you get the seal?

21:41.434 --> 21:44.402
Unfortunately, no, Captain.

21:44.404 --> 21:48.339
However, Eugene came up
with something far better.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.478
Curse you, Frederic!

21:54.480 --> 21:57.315
Frederic, curse you!

21:59.452 --> 22:02.486
(barking and clapping)

22:10.463 --> 22:13.497
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes open</i>
<i> and wide ¶</i>

22:13.499 --> 22:15.633
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:15.635 --> 22:18.035
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.037 --> 22:20.137
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:20.139 --> 22:22.940
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now,</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:22.942 --> 22:25.609
<i> ¶ Who I am,</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.611 --> 22:29.013
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:29.015 --> 22:31.182
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more of me</i>
<i> to give ¶</i>

22:32.552 --> 22:36.120
<i> ¶ Oh yeah,</i>
<i>there's more of me to give ¶</i>
