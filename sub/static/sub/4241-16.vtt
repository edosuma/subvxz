Hey, Regionals? You've just met
our opening number.

01:59.059 --> 02:01.278
That was so good.

02:01.279 --> 02:02.946
How did you manage to find

02:02.947 --> 02:04.948
a Burberry-esque
canary cage cover?

02:04.949 --> 02:08.585
Canaries don't
like cold weather.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.203
Especially Pavarotti.

02:10.204 --> 02:11.904
So, what did you
think of the song?

02:11.905 --> 02:13.906
Can I be really
honest with you?

02:13.907 --> 02:16.576
Because it comes
from a place of caring.

02:16.577 --> 02:17.677
Been there, done that.

02:17.678 --> 02:20.513
Look, you're amazing, Blaine.

02:20.514 --> 02:22.582
Your solos are breathtaking.

02:22.583 --> 02:23.967
They're also numerous.

02:23.968 --> 02:28.087
Kurt, the council decides
who gets the solos.

02:28.088 --> 02:30.473
Do I detect a little jealousy?

02:30.474 --> 02:31.608
No, you detect
a lot of jealousy.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.310
Look, Blaine,

02:33.311 --> 02:35.195
sometimes I don't feel
like we're the Warblers.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.198
I feel like we're
Blaine and the Pips.

Okay, so, I really
took all of your notes

02:46.624 --> 02:47.774
from "My Headband" to heart.

02:47.775 --> 02:49.909
And I... I really
tapped into my pain

02:49.910 --> 02:51.411
for this second song.

02:51.412 --> 02:53.496
So come and sit down.

02:53.497 --> 02:56.883
These are for you.
Just in case.

02:56.884 --> 02:58.835
It's pretty emotional.

02:58.836 --> 03:00.286
Don't be afraid,

03:54.392 --> 03:56.359
Yeah, I got that. Uh...

03:56.360 --> 03:58.528
It's better than "My Headband,"
that's for sure.

03:59.563 --> 04:00.980
But it...

04:00.981 --> 04:03.516
It still feels like you're
just playing scared.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.237
You're only dealing
with the easy pain.

04:07.238 --> 04:09.189
You got to get to
the hard stuff.

04:09.190 --> 04:10.740
That's what's relatable
to everybody.

04:10.741 --> 04:12.909
I... I'm perfectly capable
of accessing my pain.

04:12.910 --> 04:16.046
- I cry every time I sing a solo.
- Exactly.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.081
When you sing, I can feel it.

04:18.082 --> 04:20.916
I guess you just got to go

04:20.918 --> 04:23.870
inside yourself to wherever
the singing comes from,

04:23.871 --> 04:25.305
and write from there.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.974
Have you even
ever tried to write a song?

04:27.975 --> 04:29.726
<i>Sometimes I worry about Finn.</i>

04:29.727 --> 04:31.043
<i>I mean, how damaged</i>

04:31.044 --> 04:33.229
<i>does a guy have to be
to be into someone</i>

04:33.230 --> 04:35.181
<i>as annoying as Rachel?</i>

04:35.182 --> 04:37.801
<i>Still, he is a good guy,</i>

04:37.802 --> 04:39.769
<i>and I do really like him.</i>

04:39.770 --> 04:40.970
<i>He's my first love,</i>

04:40.971 --> 04:43.606
<i>and first loves are forever.</i>

04:43.607 --> 04:45.024
<i>And another thing,</i>

04:45.025 --> 04:48.027
<i>without him I'm never going
to get one of these.</i>

04:48.028 --> 04:49.396
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

04:49.397 --> 04:50.580
<i>"Prom queen?</i>

04:50.581 --> 04:53.065
<i>"You're smart and super pretty</i>

04:53.066 --> 04:55.502
<i>"and relatively sane
for a girl.</i>

04:55.503 --> 04:59.122
<i>Does being prom queen
really matter to you?"</i>

04:59.123 --> 05:00.507
<i>Well, it does.</i>

05:00.508 --> 05:02.575
<i>Prom queens live, on average,</i>

05:02.576 --> 05:04.511
<i>five years longer
than regular people.</i>

05:04.512 --> 05:06.596
<i>It's probably
because they smile a lot,</i>

05:06.597 --> 05:09.933
<i>and smiling has been proven
to ward off diseases.</i>

05:09.934 --> 05:12.102
<i>But I can't do it without Finn.</i>

05:12.103 --> 05:14.420
<i>He's a shoo-in for prom king,</i>

05:14.421 --> 05:16.606
<i>and after winning the big game,</i>

05:16.607 --> 05:18.424
<i>he'll help me land
crucial swing votes.</i>

05:18.425 --> 05:21.561
<i>Amazingly, the only person
standing in my way</i>

05:21.562 --> 05:24.263
<i>is her and her damn talent.</i>

05:24.264 --> 05:26.933
<i>If I'm going to guarantee
that he doesn't stray with her,</i>

05:26.934 --> 05:30.320
<i>I'm going to have
to play it right.</i>

05:30.321 --> 05:31.821
<i>They say,
"Keep your friends close,</i>

Pavarotti?

05:53.293 --> 05:55.395
Warblers! Warblers!
I am merely suggesting

05:55.396 --> 05:57.981
that instead of wearing blue
ties with red piping,

05:57.982 --> 06:00.233
we wear jackets with red ties

06:00.234 --> 06:01.851
and blue piping
for the competition.

06:01.852 --> 06:04.020
This is a kangaroo court!

06:07.825 --> 06:09.159
Kurt, what's wrong?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.861
It's Pavarotti.

06:11.862 --> 06:14.497
Pavarotti is dead.

06:14.498 --> 06:16.315
I suspect a stroke.

06:16.316 --> 06:18.301
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

06:18.302 --> 06:21.955
I know it's really stupid to
be upset about a bird, but...

06:23.841 --> 06:27.544
He... He inspired me
with his optimism,

06:27.545 --> 06:29.829
and his love of song.

06:29.830 --> 06:32.632
He was my friend.

06:32.633 --> 06:36.102
Now, I know today we need
to practice doo-wopping

06:36.103 --> 06:38.354
behind Blaine while
he sings every solo

06:38.355 --> 06:40.023
in the medley of P!nk songs,

06:40.024 --> 06:44.394

Guys, I've got some bad news.

08:45.232 --> 08:46.599
You know how
we decided on "Sing"

08:46.600 --> 08:48.067
by My Chemical Romance
for Regionals?

08:48.068 --> 08:51.070
Well, I hold in my hand a cease
and desist letter from the band.

08:51.071 --> 08:52.105
We can't do it.

08:52.106 --> 08:53.472
It was the perfect anthem.

08:53.473 --> 08:54.824
How much do you want to bet

08:54.825 --> 08:56.059
Coach Sylvester has something
to do with this?

08:56.060 --> 08:57.410
One step ahead of you.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.911
Do you know
anything about this, Sue?

08:58.912 --> 09:01.364
I do. Now,
I met the drummer

09:01.365 --> 09:03.649
from My Chemical Romance at a
drum circle at Daytona Beach,

09:03.650 --> 09:05.618
Spring Break, 1996.

09:05.619 --> 09:06.986
We had a brief affair.

09:06.987 --> 09:09.756
And when I heard of your
song choice for Regionals,

09:09.757 --> 09:12.491
well, I was compelled
to notify the band

09:12.492 --> 09:15.327
about your long-running
legal battle with PETA.

09:15.328 --> 09:17.213
That is not true.

09:17.214 --> 09:19.182
You took away my Cheerios!

09:19.183 --> 09:24.220
Consider this the opening
salvo of World War Sue.

09:24.221 --> 09:25.605
So what are we going to do now?

09:25.606 --> 09:28.691
I think we should write
original songs for Regionals.

09:28.692 --> 09:31.444
All those in favor of voting
Rachel down a second time?

09:31.445 --> 09:32.962
No. I think
Rachel is right.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.231
This team works best
when we push ourselves

09:35.232 --> 09:36.682
and do something
a little different.

09:36.683 --> 09:39.585
That's true, but if all the other teams
are doing amazing songs

09:39.586 --> 09:41.087
we're not going to be so good.

09:41.088 --> 09:42.622
You're right.
We're not going to be as good.

09:42.623 --> 09:43.840
We're going to be better.

09:43.841 --> 09:47.293
We won't be using
other people's words or music.

09:47.294 --> 09:48.711
It'll be our own.

09:48.712 --> 09:50.747
Our own heart, soul,
not just our voices.

09:50.748 --> 09:53.032
We have a really
talented songwriter

09:53.033 --> 09:55.551
in our midst. Rachel.

09:55.552 --> 09:57.920
I was thinking maybe you and I
could write a song together.

09:57.921 --> 09:59.538
I'm with Quinn and Rachel.

09:59.539 --> 10:01.824
I mean, if these two
can agree on something,

10:01.825 --> 10:02.975
it's probably an idea
worth considering.

10:02.976 --> 10:04.310
Wait, wait, so suddenly,

10:04.311 --> 10:06.429
you two are writing the music
for Regionals? No way.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.147
I think that everyone should
get a chance to write a song.

10:08.148 --> 10:09.565
Santana's right.
We can do this.

10:09.566 --> 10:11.317
What do you think,
Mr. Shue?

10:11.318 --> 10:14.087
I think we're doing original
songs for Regionals.

10:20.802 --> 10:22.469
Hey.

10:24.472 --> 10:26.691
Can I ask you a question?

10:26.692 --> 10:28.976
We used to be really close,
and I really miss being your friend.

10:28.977 --> 10:30.194
Still waiting for the question.

10:30.195 --> 10:32.446
- Did I do something wrong?
- No. Look, I don't know.

10:32.447 --> 10:33.915
Did you?

10:33.916 --> 10:35.816
All I know is you blew me off

10:35.817 --> 10:38.152
to be with
Stumbles McCripplepants.

10:38.153 --> 10:39.320
That's fine.

10:39.321 --> 10:40.872
It's your loss.

10:40.873 --> 10:42.423
'Cause now I get
the chance to write

10:42.424 --> 10:44.876
an awesome heterosexual
song about Sam

10:44.877 --> 10:46.511
that we're going
to sing at Regionals.

10:46.512 --> 10:47.845
Wait, you're still dating Sam?

10:47.846 --> 10:50.164
But you told me you
were in love with me.

10:50.165 --> 10:52.216
I honestly don't know
what I was thinking.

10:53.335 --> 10:54.552
Look, can you stop
staring at me?

10:54.553 --> 10:55.836
I can't remember
my locker combo.

10:55.837 --> 10:57.805
Well, well.

10:57.806 --> 11:00.892
If it isn't Tweedle-Dumb
and Tweedle-Fake-Boobs.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.676
You know, you can't
talk to us like that.

11:02.677 --> 11:04.228
You're not our cheer
coach anymore.

11:04.229 --> 11:07.231
I'm not anybody's
cheer-leading coach anymore.

11:07.232 --> 11:09.683
You betrayed me,
and in case you haven't heard,

11:09.684 --> 11:11.035
I like to play dirty.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.627
I don't even remember
putting that in there.

11:21.046 --> 11:23.364
You know,
I think Blaine's version

11:23.365 --> 11:25.132
of the song is actually
better than the original.

11:25.133 --> 11:26.751
But it's not
in his natural key, so...

11:26.752 --> 11:29.470
- How dare you.
- Enough. I'm tired of this.

11:29.471 --> 11:30.755
I agree.
I think we should just

11:30.756 --> 11:32.206
let you pick the song
that you want to sing.

11:32.207 --> 11:35.526
No, I'm tired of the Warblers
being all about me.

11:35.527 --> 11:36.894
David, please make
sure everything

11:36.895 --> 11:38.596
I'm about to say goes down
in the official minutes.

11:38.597 --> 11:41.882
We are going to lose
at Regionals.

11:41.883 --> 11:44.268
- What?!
- I am incredibly grateful

11:44.269 --> 11:46.537
for the belief you've all given me,
as a junior member,

11:46.538 --> 11:48.055
to lead you all in these
wonderful songs this year.

11:48.056 --> 11:51.025
But, from what Kurt has told me
about New Directions,

11:51.026 --> 11:53.778
I just know I can't
beat them on my own.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.414
Which is why I propose
that we rearrange

11:56.415 --> 11:59.233
our 11:00 number
and turn it into a duet.

12:00.535 --> 12:02.236
To showcase other
talent in this group.

12:02.237 --> 12:03.170
Why don't we just
play it on kazoos?

12:03.171 --> 12:04.338
Point of order! Point of order!

12:04.339 --> 12:06.841
Now, we all lost one
of our own this week.

12:06.842 --> 12:08.342
Pavarotti's voice was
silenced by death,

12:08.343 --> 12:12.463
and I don't want to silence
anyone else's voices in this group.

12:12.464 --> 12:14.465
I think Pavarotti
would roll over

12:14.466 --> 12:15.600
in his tiny, tiny,
little grave.

12:15.601 --> 12:17.802
The placement of which
has yet to be determined.

12:17.803 --> 12:19.253
All right, a vote.

12:19.254 --> 12:21.772
Who's in favor
of Warbler Blaine's proposal

12:21.773 --> 12:23.924
for a dual lead at Regionals?

12:27.195 --> 12:28.863
Oh, can I put my name
on the audition list?

12:28.864 --> 12:30.264
No.

12:30.265 --> 12:31.432
No auditions.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.935
I want
to sing the duet with Kurt.

12:34.936 --> 12:37.538
That's ridiculous.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.323
I mean, there are
so many great voices.

12:39.324 --> 12:41.075
I mean, everyone deserves
a shot at that honor.

12:41.076 --> 12:43.744
All in favor of Kurt being my
duet partner at Regionals?

12:47.049 --> 12:48.582
Decided.

12:48.583 --> 12:49.834
Congratulations, Kurt.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.618
Congratulations.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.724
All right, guys, let's hear it for
our first songwriting seminar.

12:59.294 --> 13:00.794
While Quinn and Rachel
are hard at work,

13:00.795 --> 13:02.513
we're gonna try to write
an anthem of our own.

13:02.514 --> 13:05.299
Now, these are rhyming
dictionaries for all of you.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.767
Mr. Shue?

13:06.768 --> 13:09.236
Tina and I have been already
working on a song that I wrote.

13:09.237 --> 13:10.971
Really?
That's amazing.

13:10.972 --> 13:12.657
Well, can we hear it?

13:17.079 --> 13:18.829
This is a song
that I wrote for Sam.

13:18.830 --> 13:19.997
It's called,
"Trouty Mouth."

13:19.998 --> 13:23.284

- Sit down. I'm not finished.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.653
Yes, you are. Mr. Shue,
we're not doing a song at Regionals

14:32.654 --> 14:34.388
- called "Trouty Mouth."
- You know what?

14:34.389 --> 14:35.722
I have to agree
with Sam on this one.

14:35.723 --> 14:37.408
But such a good first effort.

14:37.409 --> 14:38.725
I just don't think
it's got the, um,

14:38.726 --> 14:40.745
epic feel we need
for Regionals.

14:40.746 --> 14:42.079
Mr. Shue?
I wrote a song, too.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.564
I wrote it for Lauren.

14:43.565 --> 14:46.250
I know that when I sang
"Fat-Bottomed Girls,"

14:46.251 --> 14:47.618
it might have hurt
her feelings a little bit,

14:47.619 --> 14:50.621
but I think this
makes up for it.

14:50.622 --> 14:52.072
It's got a bit of
a rockabilly feel,

14:52.073 --> 14:54.091
so it could give us
an edge this weekend.

14:54.092 --> 14:56.127
All right. Show
us what you got.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.424
All right, guys, well,

16:17.425 --> 16:18.959
let's, uh, let's make Puck's
song a contender,

16:18.960 --> 16:20.327
but I don't totally
think we're there yet.

16:20.328 --> 16:22.680
So, everyone, look at your
rhyming dictionaries,

16:22.681 --> 16:24.715
and let's work on banging out
some songs that rock.

16:26.935 --> 16:28.435
What do you want
to wear to prom?

16:28.436 --> 16:29.836
Prom? What?

16:29.837 --> 16:31.004
Look, I know you're
excited about Regionals.

16:31.005 --> 16:32.439
So am I.
Wasn't I the one

16:32.440 --> 16:35.726
that supported Rachel's
crazy original song idea?

16:35.727 --> 16:37.695
Yeah. That was cool, by the way.

16:37.696 --> 16:39.480
But whether we win
that or even Nationals,

16:39.481 --> 16:41.615
it's not going to put you
and I back where we belong.

16:41.616 --> 16:43.450
- Which is where?
- On top.

16:43.451 --> 16:45.352
- On top of what?
- We need to get elected

16:45.353 --> 16:46.620
for prom king and queen.

16:46.621 --> 16:48.689
It's the ultimate status symbol.

16:48.690 --> 16:50.708
So after Regionals,
we'll go public

16:50.709 --> 16:53.794
with our relationship,
and start the campaign.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.714
I don't think
that's a good idea.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.832
Why?

16:58.833 --> 17:00.751
Because of Rachel?

17:00.752 --> 17:02.336
She's really fragile right now.

17:02.337 --> 17:03.587
I just think we should wait
until after Nationals.

17:03.588 --> 17:05.673
Okay, first,
it was after Regionals.

17:05.674 --> 17:07.174
Now it's after Nationals?

17:07.175 --> 17:08.474
Do you want to be
in this relationship or not?

17:08.476 --> 17:11.762
Whoa. Scary Quinn.
Okay. Uh...

17:11.762 --> 17:14.765
- After Regionals.
- After Regionals.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.511
What's that?

17:34.512 --> 17:37.463
I'm decorating
Pavarotti's casket.

17:37.464 --> 17:38.932
Well, finish up.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.967
I have the perfect song for our number,
and we should practice.

17:40.968 --> 17:42.018
Do tell.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.155
"Candles" by Hey Monday.

17:45.156 --> 17:46.823
I'm impressed.

17:46.824 --> 17:48.441
You're usually so Top 40.

17:48.442 --> 17:52.746
Well, I just wanted something
a little more emotional.

17:57.168 --> 18:00.453
Why did you pick me
to sing that song with?

18:04.642 --> 18:06.492
Kurt, there is a moment...

18:07.878 --> 18:09.996
When you say to yourself,

18:09.997 --> 18:12.132
"Oh, there you are.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.185
I've been looking
for you forever."

18:19.473 --> 18:23.143
Watching you do
"Blackbird" this week...

18:25.196 --> 18:27.764
That was a moment for me.

18:27.765 --> 18:29.733
About you.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.989
You move me, Kurt.

18:37.975 --> 18:40.043
And this duet
would just be an excuse

18:40.044 --> 18:42.328
to spend more time with you.

19:05.236 --> 19:08.188
Um, we should...
We should practice.

21:09.026 --> 21:10.343
"But," my butt, Mr. Shue.

21:10.344 --> 21:12.645
- That song was amazing.
- No, I agree.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.197
I'm just not sure that
it's Regionals material.

21:14.198 --> 21:16.149
Mr. Shue,

21:16.150 --> 21:17.450
I wrote another verse
of "Trouty Mouth."

21:17.451 --> 21:19.319
No, no, no.
Guys, guys.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.620
Just... Just think about it.

21:20.621 --> 21:22.021
What's your favorite
song of all time?

21:22.022 --> 21:23.907
- "My Headband."
- Alanis Morissette's

21:23.908 --> 21:25.524
- "You Oughta Know."
- "What's Going On," Marvin Gaye.

21:25.525 --> 21:27.293
Puckerman, you're on a roll.

21:27.294 --> 21:28.694
Okay, and what are
all those songs about?

21:28.695 --> 21:29.712
Headbands.

21:29.713 --> 21:32.999
All these songs
come from a place of pain.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.368
The greatest songs
are about hurt,

21:35.369 --> 21:37.053
and that's the
side of yourselves

21:37.054 --> 21:38.371
I want you to get
in touch with.

21:38.372 --> 21:39.639
That should be easy.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.057
Coach Sylvester
tortures us for no reason

21:41.058 --> 21:43.209
and tries to get the entire
school to hate us.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.845
Yesterday, she filled Britt's
and my locker with dirt.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.564
Okay. Okay, slow down.
Slow down.

21:48.565 --> 21:49.766
She literally
throws sticks at me.

21:51.902 --> 21:55.054
- What are you doing?
- Throwing sticks at your head.

21:55.055 --> 21:57.073
I'm going to crush
you at Regionals.

21:57.074 --> 21:58.391
Okay, what else? What else?

21:58.392 --> 22:00.076
She called
the Ohio Secretary of State,

22:00.077 --> 22:01.494
saying she was me
and that I want

22:01.495 --> 22:02.895
to legally change my name
to "Tina Cohen-Loser."

22:02.896 --> 22:04.397
She...

22:08.619 --> 22:10.637
Okay, and how does
that make you feel?

22:10.638 --> 22:14.324
Well, at first it hurts, but...

22:14.325 --> 22:16.742
Then it mostly makes
you want to win.

22:16.743 --> 22:18.011
Guys...

22:18.012 --> 22:20.013
I think you may have
just found your song.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.020
Now let's get to writing.

22:30.641 --> 22:33.259
- You're late.
- We're friends, right?

22:33.260 --> 22:34.894
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I mean, like

22:34.895 --> 22:37.063
everything happened last year.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.481
You gave your baby to my mom.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.999
We kind of bonded
over it, right?

22:40.000 --> 22:40.900
What's your point?

22:40.901 --> 22:43.569
My point is... Is that
I know we haven't spent

22:43.570 --> 22:44.821
a lot of time
together this year,

22:44.822 --> 22:47.440
but I thought that
we were close enough

22:47.441 --> 22:48.825
to be honest with each other.

22:48.826 --> 22:52.328
- Go ahead, ask me.
- Fine.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.663
Are you and Finn together?

22:53.664 --> 22:55.598
Yes.

22:55.599 --> 22:57.300
It's been a couple of weeks.

22:57.301 --> 22:59.419
It's like Groundhog's Day
with you, Rachel.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.671
How many times do you have
to make the same mistake

23:01.672 --> 23:03.056
to realize it's not going
to work out?

23:04.624 --> 23:06.625
Thank you for being
honest with me, Quinn,

23:06.626 --> 23:08.344
and... And I'm happy
for you and Finn,

23:08.345 --> 23:10.446
but don't go and try
to rewrite history, okay?

23:10.447 --> 23:13.266
It was real between us.
He chose me over you.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.018
And how long did that last for?

23:17.021 --> 23:19.022
Why are you being so mean?

23:24.628 --> 23:26.996
Do you want to know
how this story plays out?

23:28.482 --> 23:31.484
I get Finn, you get heartbroken,

23:31.485 --> 23:35.254
and then Finn and I stay here
and start a family.

23:35.255 --> 23:39.926
I'll become a successful
real estate agent,

23:39.927 --> 23:43.596
and Finn will take over
Kurt's dad's tire shop.

23:43.597 --> 23:45.998
You don't belong here, Rachel,

23:45.999 --> 23:47.767
and you can't hate me
for helping

23:47.768 --> 23:49.435
to send you on your way.

23:49.436 --> 23:51.471
No.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.556
I'm not giving up on Finn.

23:53.557 --> 23:54.774
It's not over between us.

23:54.775 --> 23:55.942
Yes, it is!

23:55.943 --> 23:58.010
You're so frustrating,

23:58.011 --> 24:00.346
and that is why you can't
write a good song...

24:00.347 --> 24:03.516
Because you live in this
little schoolgirl fantasy of life.

24:03.517 --> 24:06.285
Rachel, if you keep looking
for that happy ending,

24:06.286 --> 24:08.187
then you are never going
to get it right.

24:08.188 --> 24:09.655
So we're done with that,

24:09.656 --> 24:11.324
and why don't we just
return to our work, okay?

24:16.330 --> 24:20.249
No, I think I'm gonna write
this song on my own.

24:39.685 --> 24:41.269
Hey, buddy, you getting
ready to load up the bus

24:41.270 --> 24:43.304
and head off to Regionals?

24:43.305 --> 24:44.972
- Awesome.
- You seem awfully chipper.

24:44.973 --> 24:46.224
Oh, I am, William,

24:46.225 --> 24:48.609
I am positively drunk
with confidence.

24:48.610 --> 24:51.946
In fact, I am so sure
of my Glee Club's impending win,

24:51.947 --> 24:53.648
I'm gonna drop
a little turdlet on you.

24:53.649 --> 24:55.483
I lied to you last week, William.

24:55.484 --> 24:58.619
I forged that letter
from My Chemical Romance.

24:58.620 --> 25:00.371
Also, I didn't sleep
with their drummer.

25:00.372 --> 25:01.405
The drummer I slept with

25:01.406 --> 25:03.040
was that guy
from Jimmy Eat World.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.576
Actually, Sue,
I'm glad you lied.

25:05.577 --> 25:07.495
Gave my kids the
opportunity to try

25:07.496 --> 25:09.714
- their hand at songwriting.
- Oh, so you're trying to lose.

25:09.715 --> 25:12.967
You have an awful lot
of confidence for a rookie, Sue.

25:12.968 --> 25:16.053
William, while your kids
are singing songs about

25:16.054 --> 25:18.222
blackheads and eczema,

25:18.223 --> 25:19.991

38:54.300 --> 38:58.319
Before we start, I would like
to say I am not a witch.

38:58.320 --> 39:01.305
But, um,
I think it's fair to ask.

39:01.306 --> 39:03.408
Do we have written proof
that these kids were born

39:03.409 --> 39:04.659
in the United States of America?

39:04.660 --> 39:07.061
For a nun, I'm pretty liberal.

39:09.081 --> 39:10.815
But I'm barely a nun.

39:10.816 --> 39:13.484
In fact, I just joined because
I needed a place to live.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.003
Bless you!

39:15.004 --> 39:17.822
The convent is the one place I
knew I could stay off the pole.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.157
But my question is this.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.159
That Dalton Academy...
Is it a gay school,

39:22.160 --> 39:24.379
or is it just a school
that appears gay?

39:24.380 --> 39:28.216
Could I add a dash of Rod
to this lady soup?

39:29.601 --> 39:31.970
My hairdresser is a gay,

39:31.971 --> 39:34.806
and for fifteen years,
he's been with his partner,

39:34.807 --> 39:36.841
also a hairdresser.

39:36.842 --> 39:39.360
I see no reason why they
shouldn't be allowed to marry

39:39.361 --> 39:41.012
and raise a family
of beautiful wigs.

39:41.013 --> 39:43.448
I liked the duet
the two boys from Dalton sang.

39:43.449 --> 39:44.649
Oh, boys shouldn't do a duet.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.851
The last thing we need
to do is send a message

39:46.852 --> 39:49.821
to children that "gay is okay."

39:49.822 --> 39:51.990
It is not
a legitimate lifestyle,

39:51.991 --> 39:54.292
and last time I checked,
it's not in the Constitution.

39:54.293 --> 39:57.028
- What about that song about Jesus?
- Well, that should win.

39:57.029 --> 39:58.863
Uh, uh, uh. No, no, no, no.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.665
Now, that is just
cheap pandering.

40:00.666 --> 40:03.334
I didn't even like to be pandered to
when I was a stripper!

40:03.335 --> 40:05.386
Those New Directions
had it going on.

40:05.387 --> 40:08.056
- Those songs were fresh.
- Those songs were terrible.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.891
I am sorry,
but I'm a politician,

40:09.892 --> 40:11.659
and when I lost
my last election...

40:11.660 --> 40:13.878
and there will be a recount...
I didn't go around singing

40:13.879 --> 40:15.596
about being a loser.

40:15.597 --> 40:17.765
I Twittered
that Obama is a terrorist.

40:17.766 --> 40:20.101
- Oh, no, you didn't!
- I had to. It's a fact.

40:20.102 --> 40:22.937
- Oh, oh, gee.
- Okay, ladies, I've heard enough.

40:22.938 --> 40:24.772
Let's... vote.

40:24.773 --> 40:27.442
<i>And now, to announce our winner,</i>

40:27.443 --> 40:30.611
<i>Lieutenant Governor Stevens' wife,
Carla Turlington-Stevens!</i>

40:37.252 --> 40:40.738
My husband is verbally abusive,

40:40.739 --> 40:43.341
and I have been
drinking since noon.

40:50.716 --> 40:53.101
I'm bored.
Let's just see who won, huh?

40:59.274 --> 41:01.526
The New Directions!

41:01.527 --> 41:03.728
You're going to Nationals
in New York!

41:42.401 --> 41:44.402
Farewell, sweet prince.

41:45.571 --> 41:47.572
I'm so sorry, Kurt.

41:47.573 --> 41:50.108
I know this is really
upsetting for you.

41:51.743 --> 41:53.828
It reminds you of your
mom's funeral, doesn't it?

41:56.148 --> 41:57.698
The casket was bigger,

41:57.699 --> 42:00.535
but yes.

42:00.536 --> 42:03.004
It's not just that, though.

42:03.005 --> 42:05.456
Honestly, I'm upset that
we lost at Regionals.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.176
Well, the competition
season's over,

42:08.177 --> 42:10.178
but we'll still get to perform.

42:10.179 --> 42:12.496
We do nursing home shows
all the time.

42:12.497 --> 42:15.466
And do you know how many Gaps
there are in Ohio?

42:15.467 --> 42:17.535
Tons.

42:17.536 --> 42:20.888
Yeah, I just really...
really wanted to win.

42:20.889 --> 42:23.474
You did win.

42:24.860 --> 42:27.028
So did I.

42:27.029 --> 42:30.198
We got each other
out of all this.

42:30.199 --> 42:32.116
That beats a lousy trophy,
don't you think?

42:38.874 --> 42:40.842
I'll show you the video
when you get home.

42:40.843 --> 42:42.860
Have fun in the sweat lodge.

42:44.546 --> 42:45.863
<i>Namaste</i> to you, too.

42:45.864 --> 42:47.131
Okay. Bye.

42:47.132 --> 42:49.417
Ms. Holliday sends her best,
and can't wait

42:49.418 --> 42:50.868
to congratulate you
all in person

42:50.869 --> 42:52.303
when she gets back
from her meditation retreat.

42:52.304 --> 42:55.006
Now, we all know
that winning Regionals

42:55.007 --> 42:57.341
was a team effort, and Nationals
isn't going to be any different.

42:57.342 --> 42:58.926
But like in sports,

42:58.927 --> 43:01.229
every winning team has a player
that rises above

43:01.230 --> 43:03.564
to help carry their teammates
to victory... The MVP.

43:03.565 --> 43:07.218
And I would like to start a tradition
of honoring that player

43:07.219 --> 43:08.886
after every one
of our competitions.

43:08.887 --> 43:10.571
So, per a unanimous vote

43:10.572 --> 43:14.742
by all of you,
our Regionals MVP is...

43:16.061 --> 43:17.111
Miss Rachel Berry!

43:18.396 --> 43:19.914
Come on up.

43:19.915 --> 43:21.282
Yeah!

43:21.283 --> 43:22.783
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

43:22.784 --> 43:25.586
- If I could just say a few words?
- Sure.

43:25.587 --> 43:28.289
And here she goes,
making me regret voting for her.

43:28.290 --> 43:30.675
Well, first of all,
I just want to say

43:30.676 --> 43:32.593
how amazing
the song you guys wrote was.

43:32.594 --> 43:33.878
I... I was so inspired.

43:33.879 --> 43:36.597
You know, it's...
It's funny.

43:36.598 --> 43:39.133
I've won a lot of trophies
before for singing competitions

43:39.134 --> 43:40.301
and dancing competitions,

43:40.302 --> 43:42.586
but I've always felt
like the girl

43:42.587 --> 43:44.272
who never gets the brass ring.

43:46.141 --> 43:48.425
And maybe I never will.

43:48.426 --> 43:52.813
But today and at Regionals,

43:52.814 --> 43:55.399
the way you guys believed in me

43:55.400 --> 43:58.452
and... took a chance with me...

43:58.453 --> 44:02.073
All I've ever wanted was
to feel special

44:02.074 --> 44:05.776
and to feel chosen,
and I just, um...

44:05.777 --> 44:08.629
I wanted to thank you guys
so much for giving me that.

44:08.630 --> 44:11.115
So... That's all.

44:11.116 --> 44:12.750
MVP!

44:12.751 --> 44:19.223
