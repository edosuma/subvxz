WEBVTT

02:06.877 --> 02:09.045
And l say we continue to insist...

02:10.380 --> 02:13.049
...upon the Church's immunity
from secular interference...

02:13.217 --> 02:16.719
...and we shall continue to insist
upon it because that immunity...

02:16.887 --> 02:20.014
...was ordained by God.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.142
And this immunity
from secular interference...

02:23.310 --> 02:25.728
...should extend
to the ordained priests...

02:25.896 --> 02:29.023
...and servants of our holy Church.

02:29.191 --> 02:33.194
And they shall be free
from the threat of murder and harm...

02:33.362 --> 02:35.071
...by the use of poison...

02:36.573 --> 02:39.075
...or any other foul means...

02:39.243 --> 02:43.579
...when their only crime
has been to obey God's law...

02:43.747 --> 02:46.999
...and uphold the sanctity
of the Church.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.088
I beg you to understand....

02:53.173 --> 02:57.009
The king can't allow this.
The vote is crucial.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.929
One way or another,
he must break the Church.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.890
Now and for always.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.108
Hey, you, come help me with this.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.862
Come on. Snap to it.

03:25.622 --> 03:29.208
-Hey, Mark.
-What is this, Mr. Wyatt?

03:29.459 --> 03:31.294
It's Christmas.
The season of goodwill.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.630
-What's wrong with everyone?
-There's no mirth this year...

03:34.798 --> 03:36.757
-...because everything is different.
-How?

03:36.925 --> 03:39.927
In case you hadn't noticed,
the queen and her ladies aren't here.

03:40.095 --> 03:43.139
Well, why should we all be sad
about that?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.391
You know what the French say:

03:45.559 --> 03:48.477
"A court without ladies
is like a garden without flowers."

03:51.315 --> 03:55.443
Lady Anne, a Christmas present
from His Majesty.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.327
Thank you, Your Majesty.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.330
I've also had a great bed
made for you.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.457
It's almost ready.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.001
Your Majesty,
a present from the Lady Anne.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.217
Boar spears.

04:21.845 --> 04:25.848
Made after the Biscayan fashion,
apparently.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.102
The best.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.034
Thank you, sweetheart.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.995
Another present for Your Majesty.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.543
Come closer.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.882
It's very fine.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.051
Who sent it to me?

05:02.219 --> 05:04.887
Her Majesty, Queen Catherine,
Your Majesty.

05:07.474 --> 05:11.060
I will not receive it. Take it away.

05:16.191 --> 05:19.068
Don't let her spoil everything.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.658
Your Majesty,
the chancellor, Sir Thomas More.

05:29.913 --> 05:34.542
-Sir Thomas.
-Majesty. Mistress Anne.

05:35.293 --> 05:39.046
I have a seasonal gift for you,
with your permission.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.599
It reminds us
of what we have to celebrate.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.437
Thank you, Sir Thomas.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.063
I will treasure this.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.734
We must meet soon, Thomas.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.112
There's a great deal to do
with the management of this kingdom.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.366
There is a great clamour against
the privileges enjoyed by the clergy...

06:07.534 --> 06:09.452
...and their abuse of it.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.538
Further measures will certainly
have to be taken.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.208
I look forward to consulting
with Your Majesty.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.256
Thomas?

06:23.050 --> 06:24.300
Happy Christmas.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.737
Your Majesty.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.323
Charles.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.408
-Majesty.
-Happy Christmas.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.744
Happy Christmas.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.163
-Game of tennis?
-Good idea.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.998
Majesty.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.168
-May I speak with you honestly?
-l hope so.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.004
Are you really gonna marry
Mistress Boleyn?

07:02.172 --> 07:05.382
Whatever the consequences?
Whatever her history?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.179
Why do you ask, Charles?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.765
What do you mean,
"whatever the history"?

07:13.517 --> 07:16.519
Henry, I have it
on very good authority...

07:16.686 --> 07:19.021
...that she and Thomas Wyatt
were once lovers.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.107
She fornicated with him
on many occasions.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.026
Sometimes brazenly entering
his chambers at night.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.947
I've heard those rumours.
She denies it.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.157
Well, she would, wouldn't she?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.160
I said, she denies it.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.583
Happy Christmas.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.211
-Happy Christmas, my Lords.
-Happy Christmas, Majesty.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.507
How do you find the king,
Mr. Cranmer?

07:46.675 --> 07:49.969
I swear to you, Mr. Cromwell,
that he really is the kindest of princes.

07:50.554 --> 07:54.306
I think you were born at a happy hour,
for it seems, do or say what you will...

07:54.474 --> 07:57.226
...His Majesty will always take it
at your hand.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.561
I am not so conceited...

07:58.728 --> 08:02.231
...to suppose l am anything more
to His Majesty than a diligent servant.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.441
Your modesty does you honour.

08:04.609 --> 08:08.445
But His Majesty clearly thinks
that you are destined for better things.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.031
Which is why
he has appointed you...

08:11.199 --> 08:13.742
...his special envoy
to the court of the emperor.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.245
He can't possibly do that.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.709
Well, what l mean is...

08:22.419 --> 08:24.295
...is why me?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.839
I am nothing, Mr. Cromwell.

08:27.007 --> 08:31.135
His Majesty trusts you absolutely.

08:31.303 --> 08:35.055
You understand his great matter
better than anyone and take his part.

08:35.223 --> 08:39.351
You're better placed than most
to represent him at the imperial court.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.521
I'm sure
that you'll be a great success.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.319
And, on your way there, you'll have a
chance to visit the city of Nuremberg.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.905
The first city wholly run
by Lutherans and reformers.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.700
A city free of ancient superstition
and idolatry.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.579
Free of popery
and the abuses of the clergy.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.374
I shall look forward to your report.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.591
The Duke of Suffolk has taken it
upon himself to repeat the gossip...

09:10.759 --> 09:13.010
...about you and Mr. Wyatt.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.224
And do you believe any of it
to be true?

09:19.476 --> 09:22.728
If l did, would l be walking here
with you?

09:33.365 --> 09:36.992
I suppose you've banished
the duke from court?

10:21.955 --> 10:24.873
I've asked the French ambassador
to come and see me.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.544
I want him to draw up
a new treaty of alliance with France...

10:28.712 --> 10:31.088
...to nullify the threat
against the emperor.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.715
I'm glad.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.801
You know my sentiment
towards France.

10:36.052 --> 10:39.555
But, forgive me,
what has that got to do with me?

10:40.890 --> 10:44.143
There is another reason
why l want to see him.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.438
I intend to arrange a visit to France
for both of us.

10:48.565 --> 10:53.360
I want to present you, formally,
to King Francis.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.405
Both as my future wife...

10:56.698 --> 10:58.741
...and the future queen of England.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.370
My God.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.858
Your Grace, may we speak?

11:41.034 --> 11:45.204
I'm here to inform Your Grace,
as archbishop of Canterbury...

11:45.372 --> 11:49.333
...that the king intends to put a bill
before the new session of Parliament.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.336
What does it concern,
Mr. Cromwell?

11:52.504 --> 11:55.714
First, it means to deny the pope
much of the revenue he receives...

11:55.882 --> 11:58.884
...from the English Church.
It also means to lay indictments...

11:59.052 --> 12:02.221
...against the privileges
of leading clergy in this country.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.682
Mr. Cromwell, what can be the cause
of this further attack...

12:05.850 --> 12:07.684
...upon our holy Church?

12:08.395 --> 12:11.855
People can see that the monasteries
are already sitting on great wealth...

12:12.023 --> 12:15.067
...which could be better applied
for the good of the commonwealth.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.945
For the good of ordinary,
hard-working people.

12:18.154 --> 12:22.866
This does not strike me
as an attack against abuses...

12:23.034 --> 12:27.704
...but rather an open attack
upon our faith...

12:28.248 --> 12:31.208
...and the faith of our ancestors.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.045
That is your judgement, Your Grace.
It is not mine.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.257
Neither is it the king's.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.977
Nan?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.105
-Yes, madam?
-Draw me a bath.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.858
-The walk has made me cold.
-Yes, madam.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.902
I've got such exciting news.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.071
We're going to Paris.

13:01.239 --> 13:04.366
I'm going to be presented
before the king.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.093
Nan?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.309
Who has been
in the apartment today?

13:30.477 --> 13:32.060
Nobody, madam.
Not to my knowledge.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.146
Why?

13:35.523 --> 13:37.274
Here is a book of prophecy.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.572
This is the king...

13:44.491 --> 13:46.575
...this the queen...

13:47.785 --> 13:50.996
...and this is myself
with my head cut off.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.271
His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.484
Your Grace.

14:21.402 --> 14:24.530
I have His Majesty's order
to banish you from court.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.493
You have displeased him, it seems.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.623
Who are you, Mr. Cromwell?

14:36.459 --> 14:40.212
I feel like I should know,
but somehow l don't.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.090
I am exactly as Your Grace finds me.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.885
I serve His Majesty
to the best of my ability.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.389
Someone told me that
you were once a mercenary soldier.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.100
I saw some action in my youth.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.644
As did Your Grace, l believe.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.314
But l was never a soldier of fortune.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.067
If l displeased the king,
it was in a good cause.

15:02.944 --> 15:03.986
I'm sure.

15:04.153 --> 15:07.072
-Some would argue otherwise.
-Like you?

15:07.532 --> 15:10.158
I would never have the temerity
to argue with Your Grace.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.660
To my face, anyway.

15:13.246 --> 15:18.667
Here is the order.
You are to leave court at once.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.934
I have here in my hands...

15:36.102 --> 15:39.479
...the oath which all members
of the clergy swear to the pope...

15:39.647 --> 15:42.566
...at the time of their consecration.

15:43.234 --> 15:48.530
It is in clean contrast to the oath
they swear to us.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.541
My beloved subjects...

16:00.627 --> 16:04.630
...we thought the clergy
were wholly our subjects.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.967
But now we can see
they are only half our subjects...

16:09.135 --> 16:12.888
...if they are our subjects at all.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.732
My Lords...

16:24.317 --> 16:29.154
...l demand to know
whose subjects are you.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.157
The pope's...

16:33.201 --> 16:34.910
...or mine?

16:52.553 --> 16:54.179
Sir George Throckmorton,
Your Honour.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.432
Sir George, very glad to see you.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.686
I know you're a good Catholic man...

17:01.187 --> 17:03.689
...one who's never been afraid
to speak his conscience.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.608
So, in truth, should every man,
Your Honour.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.527
Indeed.

17:08.695 --> 17:13.365
These days, it seems there are many
who can be bullied into silence.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.743
Or worse, into acting
against their conscience.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.037
Mark my words, Sir George...

17:19.205 --> 17:23.625
...these next few days will determine
the future of our faith.

17:24.377 --> 17:28.338
Whatever Mr. Cromwell says, however
he dresses his argument up...

17:28.506 --> 17:31.049
...with honeyed words,
the effect remains the same.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.636
He is demanding that the clergy
submit themselves totally...

17:34.804 --> 17:37.139
...to the king's will
and to secular authority.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.224
God forbid he should ever succeed.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.102
If he does, there'll be no more Church,
no more religion...

17:42.270 --> 17:45.731
...no more spiritual life
in this kingdom.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.483
Cromwell might as well rape
the Blessed Virgin himself.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.528
-Your Honour.
-That's why l'm asking you...

17:51.696 --> 17:55.657
...asking you and people like you,
to remain strong and true.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.493
If you do...

17:59.245 --> 18:02.664
...then you will deserve
God's great reward...

18:02.832 --> 18:05.584
...and much worship
will come to you, personally.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.920
Believe me...

18:09.589 --> 18:12.716
...in time, even the king himself
will thank you.

18:12.884 --> 18:16.970
We give thanks for the reign
of the king's grace...

18:17.138 --> 18:22.100
...and we ask God's blessing on him
and on his people.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.229
But on this holy day,
we are obliged to say...

18:26.397 --> 18:29.816
...that some of Your Highness'
preachers are these days...

18:30.026 --> 18:32.944
...too much like those
of Ahab's days...

18:33.112 --> 18:37.783
...in whose mouth was found
a false and lying spirit.

18:37.950 --> 18:42.412
Theirs is the gospel of untruth...

18:42.580 --> 18:46.500
...not afraid to tell of licence
and liberty for monarchs...

18:46.667 --> 18:51.755
...which no Christian king should dare
even to contemplate.

18:51.923 --> 18:55.300
I beseech Your Highness
to take heed...

18:55.468 --> 18:58.386
...not to pursue the path
you seem to be taking...

18:58.554 --> 19:03.308
...or you will surely follow Ahab,
who married the whore Jezebel...

19:03.476 --> 19:05.852
...and surely will incur
his unhappy end.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.564
That dogs will lick your blood
as they licked Ahab's...

19:09.732 --> 19:11.775
...which God avert and forbid.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.653
-That's quite enough.
-Unhand me, you dogs.

19:14.821 --> 19:18.240
I am a man of God. Unhand me!

19:18.407 --> 19:20.992
Unhand me!

19:27.792 --> 19:31.837
-Come on, now!
-l am a man of God. Unhand me.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.005
You shameless friar.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.842
You'll be sewn in a sack
and thrown in the Thames...

19:37.009 --> 19:39.177
...if you don't speedily hold
your tongue.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.805
Keep your threats
for your fellow courtiers.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.140
As for us friars,
we take no account of them...

19:44.308 --> 19:48.103
...since we know the way to heaven
is as good by water as by land.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.615
All rise for the king.

20:22.805 --> 20:26.349
Parliament is in session.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.399
My Lords...

20:35.568 --> 20:37.903
...your Graces...

20:38.362 --> 20:40.363
...have you come to a decision?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.409
Do you still deny me?

20:44.827 --> 20:49.080
Or do you accept the authority
of your king?

20:54.712 --> 20:56.171
Your Grace.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.772
Your Majesty.

21:20.613 --> 21:25.116
Here is the submission
of the clergy...

21:25.701 --> 21:28.119
...to Your Majesty's will.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.792
There.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.086
-Thank you.
-They've surrendered.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.838
The Church is broken.

21:41.801 --> 21:45.762
I never thought l would live
to see this day in England.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.766
Now, by act of Parliament,
heretics are free to swan around...

21:49.934 --> 21:52.727
...the streets of London
without check.

21:53.729 --> 21:58.566
If l could weep, Sir Thomas,
I would weep tears of blood.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.787
Sir Thomas More.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.296
Sir Thomas.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.341
Your Majesty.

22:28.764 --> 22:32.350
I come to offer my resignation
from my post as chancellor.

22:33.269 --> 22:38.356
I ask Your Highness to allow me
to withdraw from public life...

22:38.524 --> 22:41.276
...so that l may spend
what time remains to me...

22:41.444 --> 22:45.530
...provisioning my soul,
and in the service of God.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.995
In this bag l carry
the great seal of my office...

22:52.455 --> 22:56.374
...which I find now too heavy to hold.

23:19.482 --> 23:23.318
I discharge you, most willingly.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.239
In everything you have done for me,
Sir Thomas...

23:28.407 --> 23:31.951
...you have always been good...

23:32.578 --> 23:33.912
...and gracious...

23:34.080 --> 23:38.917
...both in private
and in public affairs.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.254
Majesty.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.927
I promise on my honour
that I will never speak publicly...

23:49.095 --> 23:51.596
...of Your Majesty's great matter.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.935
But now, in private...

23:57.103 --> 23:59.687
...l must confess to you,
as someone who once enjoyed...

23:59.855 --> 24:03.691
...Your Majesty's confidence
and friendship, my deepest belief...

24:03.859 --> 24:07.695
...that if Your Majesty saw fit to be
reconciled with Queen Catherine...

24:08.364 --> 24:10.782
...the divisions and hurts
of your kingdom...

24:11.617 --> 24:13.451
...would at once be healed.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.710
There. l've said it.

24:26.048 --> 24:28.550
Now my lips are forever sealed.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.762
Thomas.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.767
I will hold you to that promise.

25:05.296 --> 25:08.173
Lady Elizabeth,
I come on the king's business.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.967
Mr. Wyatt.

25:11.135 --> 25:14.429
-Where is the Lady Catherine?
-Her Majesty is at prayer...

25:14.597 --> 25:17.557
...and will be for a long time.
She cannot be disturbed.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.977
-l'm charged to deliver this.
-What is it?

25:21.145 --> 25:24.189
A command that Lady Catherine
return her official jewels.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.744
Lady Elizabeth.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.624
-What do you want?
-You know what l want.

25:44.501 --> 25:48.880
Mr. Wyatt, l have no intention
of becoming your mistress.

25:49.465 --> 25:52.050
Nor anyone else's, for that matter.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.928
I shall be a virgin when l marry...

25:55.095 --> 25:59.224
...but l doubt l shall marry at all.
I would rather be a bride of Christ.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.100
A nun?

26:01.268 --> 26:02.810
I don't think so.

26:06.649 --> 26:07.899
Check your pocket.

26:33.509 --> 26:37.053
Would God thou knewest
The depths of my desire!

26:37.263 --> 26:39.973
Then might l hope
Thou nought I can deserve

26:40.140 --> 26:44.269
Some drops of grace
Would quench my scorching fire

26:57.866 --> 27:00.576
All the arrangements have been made
for my visit to France?

27:00.744 --> 27:04.080
Oh, yes, everything is prepared
and ready, Your Majesty.

27:04.248 --> 27:07.625
King Francis is most eager
to see Your Majesty again...

27:07.793 --> 27:11.296
...and to sign with you
a new alliance of friendship.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.131
And the Lady Anne?

27:13.299 --> 27:16.134
She will be received
with all due honour.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.927
I'm very glad to hear it.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.805
I only want the best for her.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.142
I want this visit to be special...

27:24.310 --> 27:26.227
...and l don't want anything
to spoil it.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.563
Do you understand me?

27:28.897 --> 27:32.150
I understand, completely.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.235
And so does His Majesty.

27:50.961 --> 27:52.670
Thank you, Mr. Smeaton.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.259
Sweetheart.

27:59.178 --> 28:02.764
Your Majesty, this is the young
gentleman I told you about...

28:02.931 --> 28:04.515
...Mark Smeaton.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.977
Mr. Smeaton, the Lady Anne
has told me a lot about you.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.397
She says you play very well.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.526
-Play something for us.
-Your Majesty.

28:48.185 --> 28:51.521
I know it was wrong of the
Duke of Suffolk to say what he did...

28:52.147 --> 28:54.857
...but do you think it's possible
we could forgive him?

28:56.693 --> 28:58.194
If you forgave him so quickly...

28:58.362 --> 29:02.407
...some people might think that
there was some truth to what he said.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.910
Yes, but to refute them,
to answer the matter directly...

29:06.078 --> 29:10.081
...and to show how much l trust you,
I will do a more important thing.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.836
I will invite Mr. Wyatt
to come to France with us.

29:15.587 --> 29:20.675
That way, no one can accuse me
ofjealousy or the slightest suspicion.

29:22.761 --> 29:26.931
My love, you have no reason
to be suspicious.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.768
Nor will ever have.

29:39.736 --> 29:43.072
I've received a most illuminating
letter from our friend Cranmer.

29:43.991 --> 29:48.369
It appears that in Nuremberg,
clergy are allowed to marry.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.622
And Mr. Cranmer has taken
full advantage of that fact.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.750
-You mean he got married?
-So it seems.

29:55.794 --> 30:01.507
Well, it won't do his career
much good here, being illegal.

30:02.050 --> 30:05.595
Well, it's illegal
for the clergy to marry now, yes.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.349
What are you saying?

30:11.310 --> 30:13.936
You want priests
to be able to marry?

30:15.856 --> 30:20.234
Perhaps I have never fully explained
myself to you, Your Lordship.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.530
When, to you and to others...

30:24.740 --> 30:28.367
...l have attacked the practises
of the Catholic Church...

30:28.535 --> 30:32.121
...pilgrimages,
the worshipping of saints...

30:32.289 --> 30:34.665
...the crawling to the cross...

30:34.833 --> 30:38.169
...the veneration of priests...

30:38.670 --> 30:42.048
...l've never been interested
in reforming them.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.258
No.

30:45.093 --> 30:48.137
My real, my only interest...

30:49.014 --> 30:51.265
...is in destroying them.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.354
On the contrary, Mr. Secretary.

30:57.773 --> 31:01.067
I think we understand each other
perfectly.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.964
There is something else,
something very important...

31:23.131 --> 31:26.509
...which must be done
before we can sail for France.

31:27.803 --> 31:28.886
What?

31:31.348 --> 31:33.140
Tell me.

31:37.062 --> 31:40.815
Make way for the Lady Anne.
Make way.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.432
To all and singular, as well
nobles and gentills, as others...

32:14.600 --> 32:17.977
...to whom these presents shall come,
it is the king's pleasure...

32:18.145 --> 32:22.481
...by this patent, to confer
on the Lady Anne Boleyn...

32:22.649 --> 32:25.610
...in her own right
and on her offspring...

32:25.944 --> 32:29.780
...the noble title
Marquess of Pembroke.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.783
And also by this patent,
to grant her lands...

32:32.951 --> 32:35.786
...worth 1 00,000 pounds a year...

32:35.954 --> 32:38.789
...for the maintaining of her dignity.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.313
The patent of your nobility.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.774
Thank you, Your Majesty.

34:06.878 --> 34:10.631
His Majesty the king
and the Lady Anne Boleyn...

34:10.799 --> 34:12.341
...Marquess of Pembroke.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.552
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

34:15.345 --> 34:18.806
-My lady.
-Your Majesty.

34:36.533 --> 34:40.411
Our dearly beloved
Archbishop Warham.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.707
He died peacefully.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.252
If one can say such a thing
at such a time.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.923
He is, perhaps, fortunate
to be gathered now into heaven...

34:53.383 --> 34:57.386
...before the final ruin of the Church
he loved and served.

34:57.554 --> 35:00.931
You are resigned then, Sir Thomas,
to our ruin?

35:01.767 --> 35:04.268
I don't know what else can be done.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.437
We fought and we failed.

35:09.399 --> 35:12.526
All I want now is to be left in peace...

35:13.320 --> 35:14.779
...to write and pray.

35:14.946 --> 35:19.450
Surely we have a duty still to act
in the interests of Christendom...

35:19.618 --> 35:21.243
...whatever the cost.

35:21.411 --> 35:24.121
I have no fear of the cost.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.710
But l have abjured the public realm.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.879
It no longer interests me.

35:33.215 --> 35:36.467
As it no longer interests His Grace.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.285
Mistress Darrell.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.998
I came to give you your poem back.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.502
You cannot give a poem back.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.341
Or a kiss, or a thought.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.179
I am sorry that you are unhappy.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.225
Burning, as you say.

36:26.810 --> 36:29.019
I'm sure l have done nothing
to cause it.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.855
Nothing?

36:31.189 --> 36:33.858
My lady, you are full of causes.

36:36.236 --> 36:39.655
Your hair, your eyes...

36:40.740 --> 36:42.408
...your lips...

36:45.537 --> 36:47.830
...all are causes of my desire.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.721
-l must go to Mass.
-l know you must.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.222
I know.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.391
Stay a moment.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.899
What are you doing?

37:57.108 --> 37:58.692
I'm giving you a chance...

37:58.860 --> 38:03.614
...to be penitent,
my beautiful, pious lady.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.469
Margaret...

38:26.262 --> 38:28.138
...darling daughter...

38:30.016 --> 38:31.684
...it might come to pass...

38:31.851 --> 38:34.478
...that l could be held to account
for my beliefs.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.982
But the king allows
for your conscience.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.275
Nonetheless,
it's better to be prepared.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.112
I don't understand.

38:43.947 --> 38:46.031
Sweetheart...

38:47.409 --> 38:50.828
...we must discuss
the question of martyrdom.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.664
No, no.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.916
Listen.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.877
Because if l thought
my wife and children...

38:59.045 --> 39:02.256
...would encourage me to die
in a good cause...

39:02.757 --> 39:05.009
...it would so comfort me.

39:05.510 --> 39:10.305
In great joy,
I would merrily run to death.

39:11.141 --> 39:14.935
Please.

39:19.649 --> 39:21.275
Father.

39:30.910 --> 39:35.706
What do you think?
They are all in the French fashion.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.043
This is the damask you gave me.

39:45.467 --> 39:46.675
Do you like them?

39:46.843 --> 39:49.011
I so want you to be proud of me.

39:49.179 --> 39:50.387
Oh, l will be.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.724
And these will help.

40:11.576 --> 40:14.495
These are the jewels
of the queens of England.

40:15.330 --> 40:18.040
I shall have them reset for you.

40:26.341 --> 40:28.258
I don't know what to say.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.344
Yes, you do.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.272
I love you.

40:43.733 --> 40:46.610
I love you with my every breath.

40:46.778 --> 40:51.698
With every fibre of my being.
I love you and l am yours.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.409
And l am yours.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.084
Wait.

41:04.003 --> 41:07.965
You have been so kind to me...

41:08.800 --> 41:13.303
...let me be kind to you.

41:16.808 --> 41:25.983
My love.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.943
You are travelling
with the king to France?

42:10.111 --> 42:11.153
I am.

42:11.321 --> 42:13.989
Will you carry out your mission
while you are there?

42:14.157 --> 42:16.533
If there is a good opportunity, yes.

42:16.701 --> 42:20.704
I tell you this, if you succeed
in killing the king's whore...

42:20.872 --> 42:23.165
...you would be the beloved of God...

42:23.333 --> 42:26.126
...of His Holiness
and of the emperor.

42:26.294 --> 42:29.046
And truly of all the faithful people
of England.

42:29.672 --> 42:32.049
And if l should die in the attempt?

42:33.051 --> 42:36.136
Then the emperor will look after
your family here on Earth.

42:36.304 --> 42:42.017
And you will be welcomed into heaven
by a fanfare of angels.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.261
My dearest brother.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.236
We are here
to renew our friendship...

43:34.404 --> 43:36.113
...and that of our two nations.

43:36.281 --> 43:39.950
Come, let us celebrate.

43:52.839 --> 43:56.300
This is a wonderful feast, brother.

43:57.385 --> 43:59.469
But where is she?

44:00.555 --> 44:02.806
Where is the Lady Anne?

44:03.975 --> 44:05.809
She will be here.

44:07.228 --> 44:10.814
I am sorry my wife and sister changed
their minds about meeting her.

44:13.234 --> 44:16.361
But what do you expect?

44:20.616 --> 44:23.994
Women are often variable.
Only madmen believe them.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.460
I have it in mind, brother...

44:31.627 --> 44:36.340
...that you and l should make
arrangements for a joint crusade.

44:38.426 --> 44:41.636
Like Richard, Coeur de Lion.

44:42.847 --> 44:45.474
Warriors of God.

44:47.352 --> 44:50.896
And, of course, no one will be happier
than His Holiness...

44:51.105 --> 44:53.857
...if we should commit ourselves
to reconquer the Holy Land.

44:56.778 --> 45:01.156
But still, we would be joint leaders
in this venture. Yes?

45:06.120 --> 45:07.454
Of course.

45:10.291 --> 45:11.833
Your Grace.

45:13.878 --> 45:17.714
I'm delighted to see you returned
to His Majesty's good graces.

45:18.383 --> 45:22.677
It gives me much pleasure
to invite you and the duchess...

45:22.845 --> 45:25.472
...to dine with us
while we are in Calais.

45:25.890 --> 45:30.477
Not as much pleasure as it gives me
to refuse your invitation...

45:32.563 --> 45:33.730
...my Lord.

45:39.946 --> 45:43.407
There are rumours that Your Grace
secretly supports the queen...

45:43.908 --> 45:46.243
...and are against the king
in this great matter.

45:46.577 --> 45:47.661
And yet, for so long...

45:47.829 --> 45:50.455
...you took immense pride
in being totally indifferent...

45:50.665 --> 45:53.083
...to the machinations and politics
of this world.

45:55.837 --> 45:57.754
So, what happened to you?

45:59.674 --> 46:01.508
I grew up.

46:17.942 --> 46:19.276
Mistress Boleyn.

46:19.444 --> 46:21.945
You must feel so excited
to be back in France...

46:22.113 --> 46:25.532
-...after all your little adventures here.
-Tut, Mark.

46:25.867 --> 46:29.369
You ought to remember that I'm still
in mourning for my poor husband.

46:29.537 --> 46:32.873
Well, l wouldn't have called him poor.
Dull, certainly.

46:34.459 --> 46:37.210
-And impotent.
-Really?

46:37.628 --> 46:43.341
I can't wait to ride some young
French stallion while I'm here.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.137
Between you and me...

46:47.597 --> 46:49.306
...neither can I.

48:09.303 --> 48:11.471
She's ravishing.

48:22.567 --> 48:23.858
Bravo.

48:34.370 --> 48:35.412
Do I know you?

49:09.196 --> 49:13.033
When you and your sister were here
in France...

49:13.200 --> 49:15.744
...as ladies in waiting to my queen.

49:15.911 --> 49:18.872
I remember it so well.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.958
Your Majesty is very gracious...

49:24.545 --> 49:29.466
...but there are some things, perhaps,
which Your Majesty knows about me...

49:29.634 --> 49:37.474
...which I would rather you kept secret,
and never mention to the king.

49:42.396 --> 49:46.316
Madame la marquise,
I am a Frenchman.

49:46.484 --> 49:49.611
I would never betray the secrets
of a woman.

49:50.112 --> 49:53.740
Especially a beautiful woman,
who must naturally have a great many.

49:59.038 --> 50:01.456
Do you really support my marriage
to the king?

50:04.001 --> 50:06.628
For one thing, l hate the emperor...

50:06.796 --> 50:09.005
...so that anything
which discomforts him...

50:09.173 --> 50:11.299
...like the divorce of his aunt...

50:11.467 --> 50:13.968
...pleases me immeasurably.

50:14.762 --> 50:18.306
But also, l know you are a friend
of France...

50:18.474 --> 50:21.476
...so we can do business.

50:29.318 --> 50:31.194
But there is something else?

50:37.368 --> 50:39.536
It is not my place to say this,
madam...

50:39.704 --> 50:42.872
...but perhaps we know each other
well enough.

50:45.042 --> 50:46.876
The fact is...

50:47.044 --> 50:51.214
...the station you will be asked
to occupy is not an easy one...

50:51.382 --> 50:53.717
...especially to those not born to it.

50:54.218 --> 50:58.138
It is much harder to have everything
than to have nothing.

50:58.514 --> 51:00.932
If l had not been born to be king...

51:01.100 --> 51:04.561
...l would certainly not have wished
that fate upon myself.

51:24.206 --> 51:26.249
Majesty.

51:36.552 --> 51:40.263
I've tried to run from the fire
that burns me.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.516
But when l look around...

51:43.851 --> 51:45.769
...there the fire still is.

51:49.106 --> 51:50.940
Sister.

51:54.445 --> 51:58.615
When you remember how it was,
when we were here before...

51:58.783 --> 52:03.036
...could you ever
have imagined this, Mary?

52:03.329 --> 52:05.121
Not for all the world.

52:06.332 --> 52:09.292
But then, I am not as clever as you.

52:11.837 --> 52:17.050
I promise you,
and l can tell only you...

52:17.301 --> 52:22.472
...that the thing l have so longed for
will be accomplished here.

53:16.694 --> 53:19.279
I thought Francis behaved himself
rather admirably.

53:25.286 --> 53:26.327
You're beautiful.

54:38.943 --> 54:43.446
Now, my love, let me conceive.

54:47.701 --> 54:50.244
And we will have a son.
