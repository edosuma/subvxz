WEBVTT

00:02.840 --> 00:04.034
Yes, I'm a very lazy eater.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.710
That's why I like soup.
First of all, it looks half-digested...

00:08.880 --> 00:11.235
...so you feel like half the work
is done already.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.868
I'm hoping Campbell's comes out
with an lV line of soup...

00:14.040 --> 00:16.554
...that you could just jam
right into your arm, you know?

00:16.720 --> 00:18.995
Campbell's tomato intravenous.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.912
Mainline gumbo.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.640
Everyone just sitting around
at dinner with their soup lV...

00:23.800 --> 00:26.030
...hanging on the hook there,
you know?

00:28.120 --> 00:30.236
How's yours, Grandpa?

00:30.400 --> 00:32.595
Oh, chunky style.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.597
What theatre do you wanna
go to tonight?

00:39.760 --> 00:43.230
We got 61st and 3rd
or 84th and Broadway.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.192
Which one you wanna go to,
Schmoopie?

00:45.360 --> 00:47.157
You called me "Schmoopie."
You're Schmoopie.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.833
-You're Schmoopie.
-You're Schmoopie.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.230
You're Schmoopie.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.392
All right, Schmoopies,
what's it gonna be?

00:54.560 --> 00:56.676
-Pick a theatre.
-We'll go to 3rd Avenue.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.752
So can you come with us
to the soup place?

00:58.920 --> 01:01.992
No, you have a good lunch.
I'll meet you here for the movie.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.349
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.078
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hi, Sheila.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.629
All right, then I'll see you later.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.711
-Bye, Schmoopie.
-Bye, Schmoopie.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.673
Okay, we ready to go?

01:14.840 --> 01:16.990
Yes, please. Please, let's go.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.752
I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.150
-No, we gotta go to the soup place.
-What soup place?

01:21.320 --> 01:23.390
There's a soup stand.
Kramer's been going there.

01:23.560 --> 01:24.549
He's always raving.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.029
I finally got a chance to go,
and I tell you this;

01:27.200 --> 01:28.519
You will be stunned.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.954
Stunned by soup?

01:30.120 --> 01:33.157
You can't eat this soup standing up.
Your knees buckle.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.799
All right, let's go. Come on.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.552
There's only one caveat.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.029
Guy who runs the place
is a little temperamental.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.509
Especially about
the ordering procedure.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.752
He's secretly referred to
as the "Soup Nazi."

01:45.080 --> 01:46.798
What happens
if you don't order right?

01:46.960 --> 01:49.520
-He yells, and you don't get your soup.
-What?

01:49.680 --> 01:51.875
Just follow the procedure
and you will be fine.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.076
-All right, let's go over that again.
-All right.

01:54.240 --> 01:58.472
As you walk in the place,
move immediately to your right.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.915
Okay, the main thing
is to keep the line moving.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.640
You hold out your money,
speak your soup in a clear voice...

02:03.800 --> 02:05.756
-...step to the left, and receive soup.
-Right.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.956
It's very important not
to embellish your order.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.271
No extraneous comments,
no questions, no compliments.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.034
-Oh, boy, I'm really scared.
-Elaine.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.395
Jerry, that's enough now
about the Soup Nazi.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.874
Look at this.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.271
You know what this is?
This is an antique armoire.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.955
It's French, armoire.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.758
Armoire.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.672
-How much is this?
-I was asking 250.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.990
But you got a nice face.
Two even.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.277
Two hundred. You know, I've always
wanted one of these things.

02:38.440 --> 02:42.069
-He gave you the nice-face discount.
-Yeah. All right, you guys go ahead.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.312
-What about the soup?
-I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.152
Pardon.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.594
This line is huge.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.239
And it's like this all the time.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.834
Isn't that that Bania guy?

02:54.360 --> 02:57.397
Oh, no. It is. Just be still.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.949
Too late. I think
he picked up the scent.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.194
Hey, Jerry, I didn't know
you liked soup.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.833
Hard to believe.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.468
This guy makes the best soup
in the city, Jerry. The best.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.551
You know what they call him?
"Soup Nazi."

03:09.720 --> 03:10.755
All right, Bania.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.514
-I'm not letting you cut in line.
-Why not?

03:13.680 --> 03:15.636
If he catches us,
we'll never get soup again.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.233
Okay, okay.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.074

03:26.920 --> 03:29.275
Medium turkey chili.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.711
Medium crab bisque.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.917
-I didn't get any bread.
-Just forget it. Let it go.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.629
Excuse me.
I think you forgot my bread.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.153
Bread, $2.00 extra.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.788
Two dollars? But everyone
in front of me got free bread.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.712
-You want bread?
-Yes, please.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.472
Three dollars!

03:56.080 --> 03:57.559
-What?
-No soup for you!

04:08.120 --> 04:10.270
What do you mean,
I can't bring it in? I live here.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.271
It's Sunday.
There's no moving on Sunday.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.829
-That's the rule.
-But I didn't know, Tom.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.151
Can't you just make an exception?
Please? I've got a nice face.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.598
Tomorrow, okay?
You move it in tomorrow.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.954
I'll even give you a hand.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.840
-You're gonna have to hold it.
-I'm the guy on the sidewalk.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.274
I don't have layaway.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.715
Oh, no. Please don't go.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.553
Please. Please don't walk away.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.638
Oh, man.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.954
Oh, this is fantastic.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.356
How does he do it?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.958
I don't see how you can sit there
eating, and not even offer me any?

04:50.440 --> 04:52.317
I gave you a taste.
What do you want?

04:52.520 --> 04:55.159
-Why can't we share?
-I told you not to say anything.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.676
You can't go in there, flout the rules,
and then think I'm gonna share.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.957
-Do you hear you yourself?
-I'm sorry.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.317
This is what comes
from living under a Nazi regime.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.275
Well, I gotta go back there
and try again.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.514
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.954
-Hi, Schmoopie.
-Hi, Schmoopie.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.475
-No, you're Schmoopie.
-You're Schmoopie.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.596
-Going.
-Hey, listen...

05:16.760 --> 05:18.990
...so we'll meet you and Susan
at the movie tonight?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.950
You know what? I changed my mind.
I don't think so.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.509
-Why?
-I just don't feel like it anymore.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.116
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.631
Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?

05:32.360 --> 05:34.191
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.355
Yeah.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.159
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

05:41.320 --> 05:43.675
Elaine has to leave her armoire
on the street all night.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.239
I'm gonna guard it for her.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.152
I need something to sit on.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.231
Well, sit on one of your cushions.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.073
But this is so nice and thick.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.708
Ahoy, there.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.836
Oh, Kramer, thank God.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.151
-I really appreciate your doing this.
-Well, you asked for it, you got it.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.878
Do you need anything?

06:05.040 --> 06:07.474
Well, a hot bowl of mulagatani
would hit the spot.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.517
-Mulagatani?
-Yeah, it's an lndian soup.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.149
Simmered to perfection...

06:11.320 --> 06:13.834
...by one of the great
soup artisans in the modern era.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.439
Who, the Soup Nazi?

06:16.600 --> 06:17.749
He's not a Nazi.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.275
He just happens to be
a little eccentric.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.873
You know, most geniuses are.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.353
-I'll be back.
-Wait a second.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.511
-You don't know how to order.
-No, I got it.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.240
-No, Elaine.
-Hey, I got it.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.472
Hey, didn't you already get soup?

06:37.640 --> 06:39.517
No, I didn't get it.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.757
Why? What happened?

06:41.920 --> 06:43.831
I made a mistake.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.953
Well, we'll see
what happens to you.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.111
Yeah, no, listen, George,
I am quite certain...

06:48.280 --> 06:50.794
...I'm walking out of there
with a bowl of soup.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.712
Let me ask you something.
Is it just me...

06:52.880 --> 06:55.633
...or do you find it unbearable
to be around Jerry and that girl?

06:55.800 --> 06:57.552
Oh, I know.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.869
It's awful.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.678
Why do they do that
in front of people?

07:00.840 --> 07:02.876
-I don't know.
-What is that with the Schmoopie?

07:03.040 --> 07:04.951
-Schmoopie.
-Oh, stop it. I know.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.237
I had to listen to a discussion on
which one is actually called Schmoopie.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.470
I cancelled plans
to go to the movies with them.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.313
-You know, we should say something.
-We absolutely should.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.392
I mean, why does he do that?
Doesn't he know what a turnoff that is?

07:16.560 --> 07:18.073
-He can be so weird sometimes.
-Yes.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.912
-I haven't figured him out.
-Me neither.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.317
I gotta focus.
I'm shifting into soup mode.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.277
Oh, God.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.031
Good afternoon.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.318
One large crab bisque to go.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.790
Bread. Beautiful.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.554
You're pushing your luck, little man.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.198
Sorry. Thank you. Thank you.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.879
Hey, there.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.756
Oh, one mulagatani, and....

08:03.160 --> 08:04.832
What is that there?
Is that lima bean?

08:05.160 --> 08:08.152
-Yes.
-Never been a big fan.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.035
You know what?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.760
Has anyone ever told you
you look exactly like Al Pacino?

08:16.120 --> 08:18.076
You know, Scent of a Woman.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.558
Very good. Very good.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.836
You know something?
No soup for you!

08:25.240 --> 08:27.549
-What?
-Come back, one year!

08:28.480 --> 08:29.515
Next!

08:31.240 --> 08:33.833
-Look at this.
-It's an antique.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.594
It's all handmade,
and I love the inlay.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.273
Yes, yes. Me too.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.715
It's gorgeous, completely. Pick it up.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.429
-Pick it up from the bottom.
-Wait, what are you doing?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.989
What does it look like we're doing?
We're taking this.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.669
You can't take this.
This belongs to a friend of mine.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.432
Look, you wanna get hurt?

08:51.840 --> 08:54.991
I don't think you wanna get hurt.
If you wanna get hurt, I can hurt you.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.354
Now, just back off.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.552
-Bob.
-Just pick it up.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.233
Hey, what is this, huh?

09:00.400 --> 09:03.278
You have some kind of problem?
What is it you're not understanding?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.795
We're taking the armoire,
and that's all there is to it.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.552
Okay?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.399
I mean, is he allowed to do this?

09:18.560 --> 09:19.879
It's discrimination.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.951
I'm gonna call the state's
attorney's office.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.554
This is fabulous, my God.
Elaine, you have to taste this.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.358
All right, all right.
Give me a taste.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.033
-Oh, my God. I've gotta sit down.
-Yeah.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.115
What happened?
Where's my armoire?

09:42.840 --> 09:44.558
-lt was stolen.
-What?

09:44.720 --> 09:46.358
These street toughs,
they robbed me.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.555
Street toughs took my armoire?

09:49.720 --> 09:51.995
Yeah, it was very frightening.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.479
My life was in danger.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.551
You should've seen
the way they talked to me.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.629
-I can't believe this!
-So where's the soup?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.831
The Soup Nazi threw me out.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.631
Yeah!

10:06.400 --> 10:08.994
-What are you gonna get?
-I'll decide at the last minute.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.952
You better decide, sister.
You're on deck.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.438
Sheila!

10:15.280 --> 10:17.191
What is this?
You're kissing in my line?

10:17.360 --> 10:18.839
Nobody kisses in my line.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.269
-I can kiss anywhere I want to.
-You just cost yourself a soup.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.069
How dare you?

10:25.240 --> 10:27.629
Come on, Jerry, we're leaving.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.554
Jerry?

10:37.840 --> 10:39.910
Do I know you?

10:45.560 --> 10:49.394
So essentially,
you chose soup over a woman?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.156
It was a bisque.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.231
Yeah, you know what
I've just realized?

10:55.400 --> 10:58.836
Suddenly, George has become
much more normal than you.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.070
-Really?
-Yeah. Well, I mean, think about it.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.992
He's engaged to be married.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.390
Your top priority is soup.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.073
Have you tasted the soup?

11:07.840 --> 11:10.149
Yeah, all right.
You made the right decision.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.793
See, it's much easier
to patch things up with Sheila...

11:13.960 --> 11:15.473
...than with the Soup Nazi.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.557
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.392
-Oh, thanks.
-There he is.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.313
Elaine, I'm really sorry
about the armoire.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.515
Yeah, I know. Me too.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.478
-So did these thieves want any money?
-No.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.518
-They just wanted the armoire?
-Yeah, they were quite taken with it.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.713
Yeah.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.880
Have you noticed
George is acting a little strange lately?

11:38.040 --> 11:39.268
No. In what way?

11:39.440 --> 11:42.432
I don't know. A lot of attitude,
like he's better than me.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.398
I don't think George has ever thought
he's better than anybody.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.718
-Hello.
-Hello.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.233
-Hello.
-Hello.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.068
Were you just talking about me?
What's going on?

11:54.200 --> 11:55.474
Absolutely not.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.078
-Something's going on here.
-All right.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.593
I'm gonna go get some soup.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.035
One of these days,
that guy is gonna get his.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.792
So how was the movie?

12:03.960 --> 12:06.599
We didn't go.
Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.758
Oh, yeah?

12:09.800 --> 12:10.994
Yeah.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.558
What, are you happy?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.748
-Happy? Why should I be happy?
-I don't know.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.797
But you look like you're happy.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.279
Why should I care?

12:21.480 --> 12:22.708
You can't fool me.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.075
Don't insult me,
because I know when you're happy.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.435
All right, I am happy.
And I'll tell you why.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.751
The two of you were making me
and every one of your friends sick.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.911
Right, Elaine?

12:37.400 --> 12:38.594
Is that so?

12:38.760 --> 12:42.230
Yeah. With all that kissing and the
"Schmoopie, Schmoopie, Schmoopie."

12:42.400 --> 12:44.834
-Out in public like that. It's disgusting.
-Disgusting?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.230
People who do that
should be arrested.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.869
I guess I have all the more reason
to get back with her.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.759
And we had a pact, you know.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.589
-What?
-You shook my hand.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.193
You're still with the pact?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.715
-You reneged.
-All I did was shake your hand.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.718
And then they just ran off
with the armoire, just like that.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.314
This city.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.398
One large jambalaya, please.

13:21.040 --> 13:24.635
-So continue.
-My friend is awfully disappointed.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.711
You know, she's very emotional.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.038
Thank you.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.636
Jambalaya.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.114
All right, now listen to me.
You have been a good friend.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.713
I have an armoire in my basement.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.075
If you want to pick it up,
you're welcome to it.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.196
So take it, it's yours.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.112
How can I possibly thank you?

13:48.280 --> 13:50.032
You are the only one
who understands me.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.760
-You suffer for your soup.
-Yes, that is right.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.798
You demand perfection
from yourself, from your soup.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.155
How can I tolerate any less
from my customers?

13:58.960 --> 14:00.552
Gazpacho, por favor.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.111
-"Por favor"?
-Oh, I'm part Spanish.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.113
Adios, muchacho.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.555
You heard him. Get out.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.719
It was stupid of me.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.154
Well, it was very insulting.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.390
No, I know.
I was really sort of half kidding.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.559
Well, behind every joke
there's some truth.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.836
Well, what about that
Bavarian cream pie joke?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.228
There's no truth to that.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.436
Nobody with a terminal illness
goes to Europe...

14:26.600 --> 14:28.272
...for a piece of Bavarian cream pie...

14:28.440 --> 14:31.876
...and then when they don't have it,
he says, "I'll just have some coffee."

14:32.080 --> 14:35.789
-There's no truth to that.
-Well, I guess you're right.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.755
-So am I forgiven, Schmoopie?
-Yes, Schmoopie.

14:41.040 --> 14:44.271
-Hey, Jerry.
-Oh, hi, Susan.

14:44.440 --> 14:46.032
George. You remember Sheila.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.509
-Oh, yes. Hello.
-Hello. Won't you join us?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.716
-No, thanks. Yes.
-Of course.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.595
So...

14:55.760 --> 14:57.557
...you sit on the same side
in a booth?

14:57.720 --> 14:59.756
Yeah, that's right.
You got a problem?

15:01.000 --> 15:05.551
I just think it's a little unusual
for two people to sit on one side...

15:05.720 --> 15:07.631
...and leave the other side empty.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.711
Well, we're changing the rules.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.472
Well, good for you.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.835
What are you getting, George?

15:15.320 --> 15:18.517
I don't know, honey.
What do you wanna get?

15:18.680 --> 15:21.717
I want you to get anything you want.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.792
Because I love you so much,
and I want you to be happy.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.393
Okay, sweetie?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.391
Oh, George, you're so sweet.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.393
Well, I can be a little
sweetie-tweetie-wheetie-wheetie.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.316
What about you, Schmoopie?
How about a little tuna?

15:36.480 --> 15:39.870
-You want a little tuna fishy?
-Yeah, a little tuna fishy.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.839
Fishy.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.592
Come here.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.032
And voilà!

15:56.200 --> 15:58.998
-Yeah.
-Oh, I love it!

15:59.160 --> 16:00.593
I absolutely love it!

16:00.760 --> 16:02.830
Yeah, did the K-Man do it
or did the K-Man do it?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.752
-The K-man did it!
-Yeah!

16:04.920 --> 16:07.229
-How much did you pay for this?
-How about zero?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.960
What? What? Whose was it?
Where'd you get it?

16:10.160 --> 16:11.388
I'll tell you where I got it.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.279
From the guy you callously
refer to as the Soup Nazi.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.396
Get out!

16:19.000 --> 16:21.594
The Soap Nazi gave it to you?
Why?

16:21.760 --> 16:25.309
Well, I told him the whole story,
and he just let me have it.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.677
Yeah, he's a wonderful man.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.354
Yeah, you know,
a little bit misunderstood, but....

16:30.520 --> 16:32.556
I'm gonna go down there
and personally thank him.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.154
I mean, I had this guy all wrong.
This is wonderful.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.753
Yeah, well, he's a dear.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.268
How much tip
do you leave on 8.15?

16:42.440 --> 16:43.953
You know, sweetie...

16:44.120 --> 16:46.793
...I just want you to know
that I was so proud of you today...

16:46.960 --> 16:49.793
...expressing your feelings
so freely in front of Jerry and all.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.269
Just knowing that you're
not afraid of those things...

16:52.440 --> 16:55.034
...it's such a great step forward
in our relationship.

16:59.160 --> 17:04.188
Because you love
your little Kiki, don't you?

17:09.920 --> 17:12.752
-How is he today?
-I think he's in a good mood.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.916
Hi.

17:16.079 --> 17:20.436
Kramer gave me the armoire,
and it is so beautiful.

17:20.599 --> 17:25.195
I mean, I just can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.

17:25.359 --> 17:29.319
You? If I knew it was for you,
I never would have given it to him!

17:29.480 --> 17:32.597
I would have taken a hatchet
and smashed it to pieces.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.432
Now, who wants soup?

17:34.640 --> 17:36.710
Next, speak up.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.756
I'm headed over to Elaine's.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.476
Jerry, those are the guys
that mugged me for the armoire.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.511
-Those two? Are you sure?
-That's them.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.157
-Let's confront them.
-No, let's get a cop.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.231
There's no cops around.
They're gonna leave.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.389
Come on, let's go.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.879
Wow, look,
that one is gorgeous.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.393
I would just kill for that one.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.357
No, not in blue.
Blue does not go at all.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.112
Do you know what
you're talking about?

18:03.280 --> 18:06.431
I don't think you know what you're
talking about. Take a look at that.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.669
Excuse me.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.678
-Are you talking to me?
-Well....

18:10.840 --> 18:13.229
I said, are you talking to me?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.516
Well, maybe he was talking to me.

18:15.680 --> 18:16.874
Was you talking to him?

18:17.040 --> 18:18.996
Because you was
obviously talking to one of us.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.879
So what is it? Who?
Who was you talking to?

18:24.920 --> 18:27.388
We were kind of
talking to each other.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.357
Weren't we?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.192
I mean, you know, I've never been
so insulted in my entire life.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.316
There's something really wrong
with this man.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.357
He is a Soup Nazi.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.636
-What? What is that?
-I don't know.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.631
"Five cups chopped
porcini mushroom...

18:49.800 --> 18:52.439
...half a cup of olive oil,
three pounds of celery...

18:52.600 --> 18:54.079
-...chopped parsley--"
-Let me see.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.116
You know what this is?
This is a recipe for soup.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.475
Look at this. There are like
30 different recipes.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.392
These are his recipes.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.152
-So?
-So?

19:03.600 --> 19:05.477
His secret's out. Don't you see?

19:05.640 --> 19:07.790
I could give these
to every restaurant in town.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.234
I could have them published.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.597
I could drop fliers
from a plane above the city.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.478
Wait, where do you think
you're going?

19:14.640 --> 19:15.629
What do you care?

19:15.800 --> 19:18.189
I don't want you causing trouble
down at that soup stand.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.429
I love that soup.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.996
-Get out of my way, Jerry.
-Elaine, let the man make his soup.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.515
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.632
Look, they have it in blue.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.279
For my baby bluey.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.989
-Are you my baby bluey?
-Oh, yes, I'm your baby bluey.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.151
Oh, yes.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.233
Well, well.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.437
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hey, Susan, George.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.352
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.

19:42.520 --> 19:45.990
Oh, really? Because we're kind of
not seeing each other anymore.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.111
Oh, no, that's too bad.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.840
Yeah, well, she was
very affectionate, which I love.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.274
You know I love that.

19:52.760 --> 19:56.309
But mentally we couldn't quite
make a connection.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.714
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.872
Too bad. You gotta have the affection,
which you obviously have.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.231
I think it's great that you're so open
with your affections in public.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.038
See, we had that.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.236
-You did?
-Oh, yes.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.511
But the mental thing....

20:10.680 --> 20:12.432
But, anyway....

20:12.600 --> 20:14.989
-I'll see you.
-Yeah.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.748
See you.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.111
Go on, leave. Get out!

20:19.280 --> 20:21.714
-But I didn't do anything.
-Next.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.032
Hello.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.949
You?

20:29.120 --> 20:31.315
You think you can get soup?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.152
Please, you're wasting
everyone's time.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.638
I don't want soup.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.360
I can make my own soup.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.878
"Five cups chopped
porcini mushrooms...

20:42.040 --> 20:43.951
...half a cup of olive oil...

20:44.120 --> 20:46.031
...three pounds celery."

20:46.200 --> 20:48.111
That is my recipe for
wild mushroom.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.234
Yeah, that's right. I got them all.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.039
Cold cucumber,
corn and crab chowder.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.270
-Mulagatani.
-Mulagatani?

20:56.760 --> 20:59.638
You're through, Soup Nazi.
Pack it up.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.350
No more soup for you.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.192
Next!

21:14.680 --> 21:15.795
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!

21:15.960 --> 21:17.871
-What is it?
-Something happened to Soup Nazi.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.429
-What is the matter?
-Elaine's causing a commotion.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.797
She got ahold of his recipes, and she's
gonna drive him out of business.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.758
Now that his recipes are out
he's not gonna make any more soup!

21:26.960 --> 21:29.235
He's moving out of the country!
Moving to Argentina!

21:29.400 --> 21:31.470
No more soup, Jerry.
No more for any of us!

21:31.640 --> 21:33.676
-Where you going?
-He's giving away what's left.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.831
I gotta go home and get a big pot.
