00:02.303 --> 00:03.037
- According to
this gossip column,

00:04.405 --> 00:07.075
my nemesis, Miles,
is dating Lisa Loeb.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.141
The Lisa Loeb.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.378
Songbird.
Sex in glasses.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.314
Meanwhile,
I have had zero bangs

00:13.347 --> 00:17.118
since moving to this
garbage pile of a town.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.588
That's not gonna work for me,
so new plan.

00:20.621 --> 00:26.594
Break up Miles and Lisa Loeb.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.429
The hell's going on here?

00:30.098 --> 00:32.133
- It's parent-teacher day.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.803
Well...

00:35.836 --> 00:37.538
Welcome to A.P. Bio.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.408
- One, two, three, four!

00:55.223 --> 00:57.325
- You can't talk to our kids
about banging.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.360
- I want to see a syllabus,
please.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.461
I want to see a syllabus,
please.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.829
- I want to know... "zero bangs"?

01:01.862 --> 01:03.431
- Okay, listen, listen, listen.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.099
I don't know what your kids
told you about me,

01:05.132 --> 01:06.467
but I went to Harvard,

01:06.500 --> 01:08.436
which means I know
how to get in to Harvard,

01:08.469 --> 01:10.204
as well as the other Ivies,

01:10.238 --> 01:11.672
because they're all
a little worse than Harvard.

01:11.705 --> 01:14.175
So keep your hands up
if you don't want your kids

01:14.208 --> 01:16.577
to go to Harvard
or one of the lesser Ivies.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.879
Now, I believe all of your
remaining questions

01:18.912 --> 01:21.182
can be boiled down
to one simple answer.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.616
All of your kids know

01:22.650 --> 01:26.454
exactly what they need to do
to get an A in my class.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.123
Right, guys?

01:29.157 --> 01:31.259
And I'm happy to report
that so far,

01:31.292 --> 01:33.561
all of your kids,
the fruits of your loins,

01:33.594 --> 01:34.862
are getting As.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.702
So have a great
rest of your day, guys.

01:41.735 --> 01:45.739
- Excuse me, are we getting
individual feedback, yes?

01:45.773 --> 01:48.542
- You honestly want to know
what I think about Marcus?

01:48.576 --> 01:51.412
- Yes.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.682
- Yeah, he's just got
a real turd of a personality.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.818
But you two seem like a couple
of wet blankets as well.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.487
Here's why Heather's cool.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.190
There's something dangerous
lurking inside of her,

02:02.223 --> 02:03.191
something edgy.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.192
You need to foster that.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.259
- Yeah, guys.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.361
Get me my own pressure cooker.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.497
I want to make brisket,
and I want to make it quick.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.632
- You're not old enough
to get a pressure cooker.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.667
- But I'm old enough
for an HPV vaccine?

02:13.701 --> 02:16.170
- Sarika has no sense of humor,
zero.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.271
Does she laugh at anything?

02:17.305 --> 02:18.872
- Sarika refuses to have fun.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.341
You think I want to be

02:20.374 --> 02:21.542
spending five hours
every Saturday

02:21.575 --> 02:23.277
at the academic decathlon?
No.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.278
- No.
- No!

02:24.312 --> 02:25.346
I'd rather be poolside,

02:25.379 --> 02:26.780
buns up, sipping a Malibu.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.550
- Seems like one of you
ought to give up the perm.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.452
- But what about
when we get separated

02:31.485 --> 02:33.454
at church or Six Flags?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.356
We always look for the curl.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.627
- Uh...
Wow.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.862
Hold hands. Get a leash.
I don't care. Go away.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.497
Hi.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.598
Mrs. Um...

02:44.632 --> 02:47.335
- Uh, no, I'm... I'm not,
um, married.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.869
I'm Trish, Colin's mom.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.404
- Oh.
Oh, Colin's mom.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.439
- Hi.
Sorry.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.606
- Well, I can definitely see

02:52.640 --> 02:54.174
where he gets his, um...

02:57.311 --> 02:59.313
His... his book bag.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.414
You got that for him, right?

03:00.448 --> 03:02.350
I mean, it's a nice book bag.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.917
You've got great taste.
- Thank you.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.954
Well, you know, kind of a
book bag, clothes connoisseur.

03:06.987 --> 03:10.524
And I mean I certainly didn't
just buy the first one I saw.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.826
- This is the first time
they've ever

03:12.860 --> 03:13.961
worked in that sort of medium.

03:13.994 --> 03:14.995
Ah!

03:15.028 --> 03:16.430
And this number one stunner

03:16.464 --> 03:17.898
is from our
figure drawing class.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.433
The contours are on point.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.969
The shading is... oof... very fly.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.003
- It's beautiful.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.605
- Excuse me, that's nudity.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.507
- It is nudity.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.809
- Did our children
see a live nude?

03:28.842 --> 03:29.810
- No.

03:29.843 --> 03:30.878
I was the model,

03:30.911 --> 03:32.446
and I certainly was not nude.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.249
I was wearing a swimsuit
and a low-rise jogger.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.285
This technically
isn't even nudity.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.519
- She wasn't naked, everybody.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.254
- Is this why my Trey
is suddenly

03:40.288 --> 03:43.491
obsessed with
extra-long showers?

03:43.524 --> 03:44.625
- Wrangle this in, Durbs.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.327
- I bet the school board
would be

03:46.360 --> 03:48.862
very interested
in this vulgar display.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.863
- Vulgar?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.399
Excuse you?

03:51.432 --> 03:53.567
I have the back
of a Gauguin island queen.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.636
- I'm gonna take care of this.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.371
- Here we go.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.411
- Yeah, I fed that
sweet little baby bird

04:03.444 --> 04:04.745
with a syringe for a week

04:04.778 --> 04:06.880
until it got strong enough
and flew away.

04:06.914 --> 04:07.881
- Hmm.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.016
- Yep.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.684
So I'm not a parent,

04:10.718 --> 04:12.386
but I get it.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.488
- Birds weird me out.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.290
- Yeah, they're filthy.

04:16.324 --> 04:19.293
- Anyway, I'm sorry that
I missed the class intro.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.894
My rehearsal went long.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.830
- She plays cello at the Toledo
Symphony Orchestra.

04:22.863 --> 04:23.964
- Yeah.
- First chair.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.499
- Cellos weird me out.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.668
- Yeah, they're filthy.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.638
See you later, Mom.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.841
- Oh, um, hey, why don't we
hang out sometime?

04:33.874 --> 04:36.043
Maybe tonight?
- Sure.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.044
Do you want to come by
for dinner?

04:37.077 --> 04:38.512
- Ooh, I don't know.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.813
I was gonna eat
this frozen burrito,

04:39.847 --> 04:41.382
but I feel like that's
not gonna turn

04:41.415 --> 04:42.716
for another year, so yeah.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.884
- Um, well, do you want to
take my number?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.085
- I'm already...

04:45.118 --> 04:46.920
- Oh, you're already
putting it.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.857
419-555-0199.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.792
- Okay, I'll call you
or I will text you.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.361
- Okay.
We'll see which it is.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.562
- Okay.
Bye.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.067
- Hi.
- Hi. Hope you like pinot.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.502
- I do.
Oh.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.870
Well, you left
the price tag on.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.872
$27?

05:04.905 --> 05:06.507
Jeez, fancy.
- Yeah.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.908
The guy at the liquor store
offered to razor it off,

05:07.941 --> 05:09.610
and I said, "No,
I don't want you to do that.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.512
I want her to know
how classy I am."

05:11.545 --> 05:13.647
- Oh.
Answer: very.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.817
Come in.
- All right.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.024
Well, this smells
absolutely delicious.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.626
- Thank you.
Spaghetti Bolognese.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.728
It's my only specialty.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.630
It's kind of a hard
first date food, though.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.565
- Yeah, there's no sexy way
to eat spaghetti.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.900
- No.
- Unless you're one of those

05:32.933 --> 05:34.602
Disney hobo dogs.
They're pretty good at it.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.036
- Yeah,
or one of those snobs that

05:36.069 --> 05:37.971
twirls their pasta
on a spoon.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.507
So un-American.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.841
Well, wait a sec... wait.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.543
You put the spoons out.
Why'd you do that?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.144
- For ice cream, you Communist.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.849
This is fun.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.919
It's been a while since
I hung out with a nice guy.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.021
- Mom, I'm home!

05:54.054 --> 05:55.789
The movie was cancelled
'cause there was a rat

05:55.823 --> 05:57.858
in the theater
that bit a stupid girl's toe.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.860
It's like, "Don't wear sandals
to a movie.

05:59.893 --> 06:00.894
Wear sneakers."

06:00.928 --> 06:02.396
Hey, Mr. Griffin.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.064
- I'm sorry.
Is it okay if he joins us?

06:04.097 --> 06:05.999
- Yeah.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.435
No, no, absolutely.
- Okay.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.669
- Wouldn't have it
any other way.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.170
- Guys want to hear more
about the rat?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.439
Saw it pretty good.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.873
- Nah.
- Sure, honey.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.108
- Yeah. Yeah, let's...

06:20.147 --> 06:20.981
- So like, you know,
Cornish game hen...

06:22.483 --> 06:24.184
- Mm-hmm.
- Pigeons, things like that.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.719
You know, it's basically like
a historical recreation of...

06:29.156 --> 06:32.926
- Like a historical recreation
of what Beethoven ate.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.728
Like a food diary, basically.
- Hmm.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.664
Wow.
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.165
- Mom, can you cut this for me?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.033
The noodles are
sticking to my uvula.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.802
- I think you're, uh,
old enough

06:41.835 --> 06:43.604
to cut up your own spaghetti
there, champ.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.038
- Yeah.

06:46.974 --> 06:50.143
- Um, anyway,
when Beethoven went deaf...

06:52.245 --> 06:55.716
Uh, his other senses just went
absolutely bananas.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.850
- What?
Sorry.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.486
You know, Colin,
I'll just cut it.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.121
- Have you ever read
any historical food diaries?

07:02.222 --> 07:04.758
- I haven't read
a food diary per se,

07:04.792 --> 07:06.159
but in
"The Diary of Anne Frank,"

07:06.193 --> 07:07.961
she talks about
the monotony of the potatoes.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.830
Does that count?
- No.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.164
- Well, I think it does.

07:11.198 --> 07:15.135
Right, I mean,
why wouldn't it count?

07:15.168 --> 07:16.203
- Yeah.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.641
- All right,
I'll go get dessert.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.742
- All right.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.612
Sounds good.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.213
All right.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.949
I'll give you 20 bucks...
- Make it 40.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.787
- Fine, $40.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.788
- Okay.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.790
Salted caramel sundaes.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.259
- Mom, Mr. Griffin
gave me 40 bucks.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.194
- For what?
- I don't know!

07:43.564 --> 07:45.599
Just... yeah.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.615
- Ah!

08:01.649 --> 08:02.883
- Yay.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.217
- Sometimes I play my sax
so hard,

08:04.251 --> 08:06.053
I get a tongue rash
from the reed.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.888
But the cool thing
about a tongue rash is,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.022
you can scratch it
with your teeth.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.526
Like this.
See?

08:12.560 --> 08:13.827
- Ugh.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.028
- I'm tired.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.196
I'm gonna go to bed.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.197
- Okay.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.966
Well, good night, baby duck.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.768
Quack!

08:20.801 --> 08:21.769
- No.

08:21.802 --> 08:22.970
- So...

08:23.003 --> 08:25.238
Would you like to retire
to the sofa?

08:25.272 --> 08:28.175
And we could talk about
historical food diaries.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.744
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Was that boring?

08:30.778 --> 08:33.046
I thought it was a little more
interesting than tongue rashes.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.280
I don't know, though.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.049
I think...
I think this one wins.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.784
Maybe when you do it.

08:37.818 --> 08:38.785
Oh, my god, wait.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.253
- What?

08:40.287 --> 08:42.222
- Can I see your tongue again?
Because you know what?

08:42.255 --> 08:44.057
You might have poison ivy,
but I'm not sure.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.760
I need to take a little bit
of a closer peek.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.095
- Mom!

08:48.128 --> 08:50.564
I cut my nostril
with the nose hair scissors.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.065
There's blood.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.602
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I should go help him.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.269
I mean, the poor kid
has orange nose hairs.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.772
If he doesn't stay on top
of it, he'll be crucified.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.908
- Yeah.
- Um...

09:02.142 --> 09:04.945
Thanks for coming by.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.780
- Oh, okay.

09:06.814 --> 09:07.781
I should go.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.317
- All right.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.086
- I sneezed on the guest towel.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.222
I think it's totaled.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.757
- Sorry.
- Nah, it's okay.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.158
- Um, have a good night.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.760
- Yeah, you too.
I'll see myself out.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.194
It's cool.
- Okay.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.339
- Go.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.643
Sara Baker, sophomore,
volleyball, peanut allergy.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.044
- Exacta-lootly!

09:37.077 --> 09:38.946
crowd: Bring back our back!

09:38.979 --> 09:40.380
Bring back our back!

09:40.413 --> 09:43.316
- Is that pregnant mouse
in the water fountain again?

09:43.350 --> 09:46.053
- Please, just let her have her
babies in there, Ralph.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.656
She's old!

09:48.689 --> 09:50.658
All: Bring back our back!

09:50.691 --> 09:52.793
Bring back our back!

09:52.826 --> 09:54.061
Bring back our back!

09:54.094 --> 09:55.062
- You got to...
all: Bring back our back!

09:55.095 --> 09:56.630
- Hey, please!

09:56.664 --> 09:58.131
You're gonna interrupt classes,
all right?

09:58.165 --> 09:59.166
Ladies and...

09:59.199 --> 10:01.401
Coach.
- Good.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.704
The school needs to know
that you hate art.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.805
- Yeah, you hate it.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.873
- I don't hate art.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.207
The... the parents thought

10:07.240 --> 10:08.776
that the back drawing
was gateway nudity.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.210
And when you think about it,
the back is

10:10.243 --> 10:11.945
around the corner
from the boobs,

10:11.979 --> 10:13.881
and then you make a right turn,
and you're at the butt.

10:13.914 --> 10:17.350
- Sounds like Ralph is thinking
a lot about boobs and butts.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.287
- Right, while we're out here
fighting for art.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.756
Is this a school
or a dictatorship,

10:22.790 --> 10:23.991
Chairman Mralph?

10:24.024 --> 10:26.026
All: Chairman Mralph!
- All right.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.795
All: Chairman Mralph!
- Guys, Chairman Mralph!

10:27.828 --> 10:29.162
- Guys, guys, "Chairman Mralph"

10:29.196 --> 10:31.264
is a little bit of a stretch,
okay?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.034
I'm gonna fix this, all right?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.235
All: Chairman Mralph!
- Okay, fix it.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.304
All: Chairman Mralph!

10:37.337 --> 10:38.972
- So what's wrong with you?

10:39.006 --> 10:41.141
- I'm sweating so hard,
I think I'm gonna pass out.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.976
- Well,
then lose the turtleneck.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.211
- I can't.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.979
And I don't want to
talk about it!

10:46.013 --> 10:47.781
All: Chairman Mralph!

10:47.815 --> 10:49.082
Chairman Mralph!

10:49.116 --> 10:50.751
- What?

10:52.052 --> 10:53.754
- Oh.
You're here!

10:53.787 --> 10:56.724
I mocked up an incriminating
photo to send to Lisa Loeb.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.860
It's Miles licking
Alanis Morissette's neck.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.128
- Wow, Anthony, that...

11:01.161 --> 11:02.162
You're an artist.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.163
Go for it.
Get it done.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.264
Hey, Colin.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.432
You know, I was just thinking...

11:05.465 --> 11:06.366
I'm so curious.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.936
Did you happen to
bang your mom last night?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.804
Because I sure as hell didn't.

11:10.838 --> 11:11.905
- No.
- Wait.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.206
Are you dating Colin's mom?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.142
Isn't that
a conflict of interest?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.810
- Are you gonna start
giving him extra credit

11:16.844 --> 11:18.345
because you're doing his mom?
- He's not doing my mom.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.747
- Yeah, because
you wouldn't leave us alone

11:19.780 --> 11:20.948
long enough to do it.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.282
By the way,
I want my 40 bucks back.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.184
- I tried to leave you alone
and go to bed.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.219
- Man, you blocked me
all night.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.955
You brought out your saxophone.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.289
You showed us how to stop
a ceiling fan with your hand.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.958
That's not a cool trick.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.027
- Mr. Griffin, have you ever
dated a single mom?

11:34.061 --> 11:35.362
- Uh, yeah, yeah, one time.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.797
But she had a C-section,
so it was all good.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.966
You are a bad person.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.300
- Yeah, I forget
you don't get jokes.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.969
Tell your mom that one.
She'll love it.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.170
- You know, the obvious way
to a single mom's heart

11:43.203 --> 11:44.471
is through her child.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.874
- You should have
shown Colin some love.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.309
- Yeah, she would have
popped off on you, boss.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.278
- Okay, look, guys.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.345
Let's get one thing straight.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.446
This isn't one of those cheesy

11:53.480 --> 11:55.382
"Jerry Maguire" type situations

11:55.415 --> 11:57.818
where I win the mom
by falling in love

11:57.851 --> 11:58.919
with the freaky looking kid.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.253
- Fine.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.522
Then it's bye-bye Trish.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.457
- All right, shut up, Marcus.
Shut up. Let me think.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.994
Okay, we need to make a pros
and cons list.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.195
Yeah.
That's what we'll do.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.429
Victor, go to the board.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.465
On the pro side,
she's, uh...

12:12.499 --> 12:14.134
well, gorgeous.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.136
Smart.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.338
She's funny.
Talented.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.874
And on the con side...
Well, really...

12:20.908 --> 12:23.076
Really, it's just Colin.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.346
I mean, I really hate
the Colin part.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.548
- Yeah, if you become
Colin's dad,

12:28.581 --> 12:30.183
he'll probably be
the last face you see

12:30.217 --> 12:31.852
as you take your dying breath.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.221
- I know, but I just can't stop
thinking about her.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.924
She's probably chilling
in a bath tub right now.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.091
- She's at work.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.526
- Let me ask you a question.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.329
Does Colin's mom
give you butterflies?

12:42.362 --> 12:44.798
- What, like, in my tummy?

12:45.565 --> 12:46.834
Hell yes, Anthony.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.002
- If it's legit
tummy butterflies,

12:49.036 --> 12:52.405
then isn't it worth
being Colin's fake dad?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.909
- Yes.

12:55.943 --> 12:56.944
Yes!

12:56.977 --> 12:58.245
Yes, you guys, it is!

12:58.278 --> 13:00.047
I'm gonna do it!
I'm gonna go for it.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.849
I'm crushing hard
on Colin's mom.

13:01.882 --> 13:02.950
Yeah.
All right, yeah, man.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.117
Let's do it, Colin.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.385
What's up, man?
You want to...

13:05.418 --> 13:06.519
Wait, you want to play catch?
- No.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.555
But I do need to build a rocket

13:08.588 --> 13:10.390
for the father/son
rocket launch.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.959
God, I hate that name.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.593
Father/son rocket launch?
But, yeah, I'll do it.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.963
I'll do it, yeah.
Let's build a rocket together.

13:15.996 --> 13:16.964
I'm gonna suffer through it.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.298
I'm frickin' enamored!

13:18.331 --> 13:19.933
Whoo!

13:19.967 --> 13:20.968
Yeah!

13:21.001 --> 13:22.302
I must have her!

13:30.043 --> 13:31.011
- Students must disperse
from the lobby

13:31.778 --> 13:33.847
and go back to their classes.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.282
- I gotta know
what's under that turtleneck.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.551
- I have an embarrassing
back tattoo.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.121
- "M loves KJ"?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.456
Wait, those are
your husband's initials.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.858
Michelle loves Keith Jones.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.526
Why is that embarrassing?

13:46.559 --> 13:48.395
- I got it before I met Keith.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.263
It stands for Kendall Jackson.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.932
The chardonnay?

13:51.965 --> 13:53.533
Please don't tell him
I have a tattoo.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.534
He hates chardonnay.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.635
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.038
Keith has never seen your back,

13:58.071 --> 13:59.006
ever?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.607
I mean, what about bikinis?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.142
- What about them?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.310
I mean, are we just gonna
bring up anything now?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.411
What about lawn mowers?

14:04.444 --> 14:05.412
- No. No.
- Okay, everybody,

14:05.445 --> 14:06.613
you know what to do.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.216
You got to be the back to...

14:09.249 --> 14:10.483
all: Free the back!

14:10.517 --> 14:12.953
Backs aren't bad,
and that's a fact.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.221
You got to be...
- Okay, everyone.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.357
I've heard your cries
for justice.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.326
And I think I found a solution

14:19.359 --> 14:21.995
that will please all sides.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.172
- That's body-shaming!

14:32.205 --> 14:34.341
All: Body-shamer!

14:34.374 --> 14:35.575
Body-shamer!

14:35.608 --> 14:37.177
Body-shamer!

14:37.210 --> 14:38.111
Body-shamer!

14:38.145 --> 14:40.513
Body-shamer!
- Get him!

14:40.547 --> 14:43.183
All: Body-shamer!
- Don't let him get away!

14:44.952 --> 14:46.286
- All right,
now we gotta make sure

14:46.319 --> 14:48.922
we glue these fins on
perfectly straight.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.391
It's the only way to humiliate
all those other rockets.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.592
- Hey, guys.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.661
Just baked these for you.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.396
Be careful.
Don't burn your mouths.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.232
- You having fun?

14:59.266 --> 15:00.267
- He's doing most of it.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.701
- Oh, no, that's not true.
No.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.070
I was actually
just teaching Colin here

15:03.103 --> 15:05.505
the value of two-part epoxy.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.074
- Oh.
- Yeah.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.108
Yeah, you got
a real special guy

15:08.141 --> 15:11.111
on your hands here, Trish.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.479
I love him.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.181
I love your son.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.415
- Okay.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.950
Oh, uh, Col,

15:16.984 --> 15:18.285
your dad said
that you called this morning

15:18.318 --> 15:19.552
to ask him to bring by
his bike pump today,

15:19.586 --> 15:22.489
but he can't do it.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.258
Dang it!
- Whoa!

15:25.292 --> 15:26.693
Dude, what are you doing, man?
Watch the rocket.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.295
- I don't care
about the dumb rocket.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.163
I wanted my dad to come here,
see me and you

15:30.197 --> 15:32.165
building this thing
and get super jealous.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.700
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.368
You were using me?

15:35.402 --> 15:36.603
I was just using you.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.272
- Yeah, I was,
but it didn't work.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.974
Now get!

15:41.008 --> 15:42.642
- Did you just tell me
to "get"?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.150
- Are you still here?
I said, "Get!"

15:50.183 --> 15:51.351
- No, I'm not gonna "get!"

15:51.384 --> 15:52.652
We're sticking to the plan,

15:52.685 --> 15:54.087
and we're building
this stupid rocket

15:54.121 --> 15:55.388
and your mom's
gonna pop off on me.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.423
- Excuse me?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.690
- No, no, no, no.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.226
Dude, that's not even
my expression.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.493
That's, like,
something I heard, like,

16:00.527 --> 16:01.494
one of the girls
in my class say.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.463
- That's so much worse.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.597
- Yeah, that...
That sounded bad.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.999
No. No, no.
Honestly, Trish.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.134
That's not how I feel
about you.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.701
- You heard the lady, Jack.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.103
Get.
- Oh, my god.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.404
What is this "get" business?
No.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.006
Look, okay, Trish,
I'm tired of this.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.307
You gotta choose.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.276
Either him or me.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.011
- What?
Him!

16:18.045 --> 16:19.346
Obviously him!

16:19.379 --> 16:20.480
- Aww!

16:20.513 --> 16:21.681
Come on. Real... For real?

16:21.714 --> 16:22.715
- Get!

16:22.749 --> 16:23.783
- You know what?
Fine.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.385
I'm taking my two-part epoxy.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.255
- Oh, my god.

16:32.092 --> 16:32.792
All: Shame on you!
Shame on you!

16:34.294 --> 16:35.795
Shame on you!

16:35.828 --> 16:37.730
Shame on you!

16:37.764 --> 16:39.332
Shame on you!

16:39.366 --> 16:40.600
Shame on you!

16:40.633 --> 16:43.036
- Have you all
lost your damn minds?

16:43.070 --> 16:44.637
A Durbin piñata?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.406
Okay, you guys took it
way too far.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.108
Everybody, go back to class!

16:48.141 --> 16:49.509
Oh, my kingdom.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.179
What happened to my kingdom?

16:52.212 --> 16:53.546
- I'll tell you what happened.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.115
You used to be a cool-ass king,

16:55.148 --> 16:56.516
but now you're wack as hell.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.451
I shut down the protest, Ralph.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.686
'Cause I have your back,

16:59.719 --> 17:03.323
even though
you didn't have mine.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.757
- That's an incredible
likeness.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.327
- We just finished
the papier-mâché unit.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.128
I'm a good teacher, Ralph.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.098
- I know.
You're... you're the best.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.632
I should have supported you.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.634
But I pussed out in front of
all those parents.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.336
I...
You know what?

17:16.368 --> 17:17.770
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.

17:17.804 --> 17:23.542
To make up for it,
I am gonna put this right here.

17:23.576 --> 17:28.281
So that your beautiful,
strong, sexy,

17:28.315 --> 17:30.550
brave, empowered back
will watch over

17:30.583 --> 17:34.487
every move I make
as king of this high school.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.124
- Okay.
Now you're making this weird.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.125
- Weird?

17:38.158 --> 17:39.392
This is art.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.528
Look at the supple
shoulder blades.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.696
The voluptuous spine.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.198
- You know what?
I'm taking this.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.466
You can't be trusted.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.834
You want it too bad.

17:47.867 --> 17:51.204
Dirty Durbs
trying to peep my back?

17:51.238 --> 17:52.672
No, please.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.809
- All right, guys.

17:56.843 --> 17:57.810
Grade update.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.512
Everybody's got an A

17:59.546 --> 18:01.514
except for Colin, who has an F.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.883
- You're just mad because
my mom won't give you an F.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.885
Class: Ooh!

18:05.918 --> 18:07.387
Oh, we're doing "Oohs" now?

18:07.420 --> 18:08.588
Huh?
Is that gonna be a thing?

18:08.621 --> 18:10.557
- What's the real reason
you're mad?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.892
- He's just mad
'cause his dad sucks.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.194
News flash, Colin:

18:14.227 --> 18:15.462
All dads suck.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.364
Okay?
All they do is yell at the TV

18:17.397 --> 18:18.465
and burp loudly while talking

18:18.498 --> 18:19.732
and forget to take you fishing

18:19.766 --> 18:21.368
every single Saturday
for six months

18:21.401 --> 18:23.436
even though you bought
ice fishing boots

18:23.470 --> 18:24.437
with your birthday money.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.306
Dads are full idiots!

18:26.339 --> 18:28.741
- That hurt runs deep, y'all.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.511
- Wearing a ladies' shirt?

18:31.544 --> 18:32.712
- It's a male leotard

18:32.745 --> 18:34.747
for a protest
that's now over.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.284
Does anyone have an XL cardigan
or a shawl?

18:37.317 --> 18:40.453
- The point is, Colin,
nobody likes dads, all right?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.289
Class, raise your hand
if you like your dad.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.856
- Yeah.
- He's my hero.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.825
- I love my dad even though he
restricts my Internet access.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.894
- Even you, Devin?

18:47.927 --> 18:50.197
- Oh, yeah.
My mom's the problem.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.899
- I guess we're the only ones
with bad dads.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.480
- All right.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.782
Now, if you hit the ball
just right,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.284
you should hit
one of the rockets

19:11.318 --> 19:12.919
and cause a domino effect.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.489
- My mom would probably
think this is cool of you.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.791
- Yeah, well,
this isn't about her.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.860
All right, go ahead
and line up your shot.

19:20.893 --> 19:21.861
Go ahead.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.864
A little bit wider
on your stance there, bud.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.433
Good.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.301
All right.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.936
Give it a blast.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.274
- I missed it.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.608
- Okay.
Uh...

19:35.642 --> 19:37.710
Well, look, man.
It had a lot of power on it.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.746
I certainly felt the wind.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.248
Here.
Let me... let me give it a whirl.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.750
Let's see what we got here.

19:43.783 --> 19:44.951
All right.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.864
Oh!

19:57.897 --> 19:59.332
Ooh!

19:59.366 --> 20:00.600
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

20:00.633 --> 20:01.734
What are you doing, man?

20:01.768 --> 20:02.902
What are you doing?
Come on.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.405
- I see them!

20:05.438 --> 20:07.440
Up there!
- Get 'em!

20:09.276 --> 20:11.744
- Good morning, Lisa Loeb,
my little snuggle bug.

20:11.778 --> 20:16.783
- What the hell is this, Miles?

20:16.816 --> 20:17.884
- That's not me.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.486
- Read the caption.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.621
- "Nothing better
than a quick neck lick

20:21.654 --> 20:23.556
in a DQ parking lot."

20:23.590 --> 20:24.557
- The DQ?

20:24.591 --> 20:25.825
Is that where you take

20:25.858 --> 20:28.495
all your musician girlfriends,
Miles?

20:28.528 --> 20:30.430
Alanis Morissette!

20:34.534 --> 20:36.369
- No, no.
Not my Michelle Obama...

20:36.403 --> 20:37.570
Commemorative plate.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.339
Ah, that's expensive.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.576
You missed one, baby.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.679
No, no, no, no.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.680
Don't do that.
You'll put your back out.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.681
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.049
That... that is not real.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.320
That is some exceptionally good
photo doctoring,

20:53.353 --> 20:54.654
but it's not real.

20:54.687 --> 21:00.026
This, this heat, this fire,
all this mess:

21:00.059 --> 21:02.395
this, this is real.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.331
- I hate you.
- Good.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.900
Because you can't hate what you
don't love.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.538
Huh?

21:11.571 --> 21:12.539
- All right.

21:12.572 --> 21:13.873
- Yeah.
