00:06.467 --> 00:10.995
<i>We need an orderly to room 206.
Orderly please to room 206.</i>

00:11.172 --> 00:13.663
Man, I don't know how
I let you talk me into this.

00:13.841 --> 00:16.708
Every student needs to complete
30 hours of community service.

00:16.878 --> 00:19.642
Yeah. But we could have served
our community by lifeguarding...

00:19.814 --> 00:23.045
...a girls' swim class instead of
hanging out with the denture crowd.

00:23.217 --> 00:24.809
I mean, what's the attraction?

00:27.588 --> 00:29.556
Hi, Clark, Pete.

00:29.724 --> 00:31.851
Lana, I didn't know
you were volunteering here.

00:32.026 --> 00:33.755
- Yeah, right.
- For a couple of weeks now.

00:33.928 --> 00:36.863
- You part of the companion program?
- I'm reading with Cassandra.

00:37.031 --> 00:40.865
She's an interesting woman. Some of
the nurses say she can see the future.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:58.619 --> 01:02.487
It takes two of you
to read to me now, does it?

01:02.657 --> 01:05.352
Don't just stand there, come in.

01:07.161 --> 01:11.120
- How'd you know there were two of us?
- Well, I'm blind, not deaf.

01:11.299 --> 01:15.895
I heard your little friend's shoes
squeaking all the way down the hall.

01:16.104 --> 01:18.902
Can you really tell the future?

01:19.607 --> 01:22.599
- Way to go, Pete, real subtle.
- What's your name?

01:23.144 --> 01:27.604
- Pete Ross.
- Mr. Ross, if you want your fortune told...

01:27.782 --> 01:29.215
...go to the circus.

01:38.092 --> 01:43.155
It's a long walk home, Mr. Ross.
Check your pockets.

01:46.701 --> 01:51.229
Oh, man. I locked my keys in the car.

01:51.873 --> 01:54.205
Dude, you're on your own.

01:56.377 --> 01:59.972
Now, what's your name?

02:03.584 --> 02:07.179
Mr. Bollston? It's Lana Lang.

02:18.833 --> 02:19.822
Lang.

02:22.803 --> 02:26.204
The Langs moved to Smallville in 1938...

02:26.841 --> 02:31.210
...took over a couple of Dust Bowl farms.
Knew a bargain when they saw it.

02:31.412 --> 02:35.212
- You're a local-history buff.
- It's kind of my obsession.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.481
So...

02:38.186 --> 02:40.279
Are you my next victim?

02:40.488 --> 02:43.013
You don't look that scary to me.

02:44.425 --> 02:47.155
You should have known me
in my younger days.

02:47.929 --> 02:50.454
I'm sure you were quite the heartbreaker.

02:50.665 --> 02:53.361
How about a spin around the grounds
and you can tell me...

02:53.534 --> 02:56.526
...what the Langs have been doing
since 1938.

02:59.607 --> 03:03.839
It's so beautiful. I don't know why
more people don't come out here.

03:04.011 --> 03:07.003
They're too busy watching television.

03:07.281 --> 03:12.344
Say, would you mind running back
to my room and getting me a scarf?

03:12.553 --> 03:15.488
- I don't want to catch a chill.
- Sure.

03:15.690 --> 03:18.056
Honey, you're a doll.

03:43.784 --> 03:46.309
Water, please.

04:32.099 --> 04:33.930
What's wrong?

04:37.104 --> 04:39.504
Someone close to you is going to die.

04:41.342 --> 04:42.934
Very soon.

05:49.877 --> 05:52.869
When you need this kind of stuff done,
ask me. That's why I'm here.

05:53.247 --> 05:57.183
- Something bothering you, Clark?
- I think we should start putting safety first.

05:57.351 --> 05:59.512
If you haven't noticed,
this stuff is dangerous.

05:59.687 --> 06:03.714
Yeah, well, this is a farm.
It kind of goes along with the territory.

06:03.891 --> 06:05.518
Seriously, son, what's going on?

06:07.194 --> 06:09.526
At the retirement center
I met this old, blind lady.

06:09.697 --> 06:12.029
I know it sounds crazy,
but she can see the future.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.592
What did she tell you?

06:13.801 --> 06:15.996
That someone very close to me will die soon.

06:17.972 --> 06:21.908
Listen, Clark. You can't let some old lady
scare you with a half-baked prediction.

06:22.076 --> 06:24.874
I mean, she probably just does it
to scare the nurses anyway.

06:25.045 --> 06:27.309
She told Pete he'd be walking home,
seconds later...

06:27.481 --> 06:29.711
...he realized that he
locked his keys in his car.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.544
No one can tell the future.

06:31.752 --> 06:35.119
What if she can? What if she told me
because I can do something about it?

06:35.289 --> 06:38.383
Then she should have given you
more information: name, time, place.

06:38.559 --> 06:42.552
Yeah, and even if she can predict
the future, she can't control it. Nobody can.

07:25.639 --> 07:29.234
Fate's given you a second chance,
Harry boy.

07:29.410 --> 07:31.503
And this time...

07:32.746 --> 07:34.805
...they're gonna pay.

07:36.784 --> 07:37.876
Order up.

07:54.301 --> 07:58.169
God, I haven't been able to eat one of these
in years. I mean, not since the bypass.

07:59.874 --> 08:03.469
- That was a joke.
- You're a riot.

08:03.644 --> 08:06.135
What can I get you to drink?

08:09.617 --> 08:14.247
How much is coffee?
From, you know, beans?

08:14.421 --> 08:15.683
$2.75.

08:16.524 --> 08:18.492
They carry it from
South America by foot?

08:18.692 --> 08:22.389
- You sound like my grandpa.
- Just make sure it's hot.

08:22.563 --> 08:25.191
Yep. Whatever.

08:25.366 --> 08:27.732
It's not your fault, Lana.

08:27.902 --> 08:31.235
Do you know anyone else who's lost
an entire old person in a wheelchair?

08:31.405 --> 08:35.466
Nope, that's pretty impressive,
even by Smallville standards.

08:35.676 --> 08:36.972
Maybe he was kidnapped.

08:37.177 --> 08:39.907
Who'd want to kidnap Harry?
He's just a harmless old man.

08:40.114 --> 08:42.514
Maybe a koi turned into a piranha
and ate him.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.681
You asked for my help.
I'm just thinking out of the box.

08:45.886 --> 08:48.013
I like your theory.

08:48.188 --> 08:50.713
You might want to work on
your eavesdropping technique.

08:50.925 --> 08:55.191
Sorry. I'm new in town. I just heard
this is where young people congregate.

08:57.064 --> 09:00.124
Yeah, we congregate here often.

09:00.301 --> 09:03.031
Hi, I'm Clark.
The rude one's Chloe, and this is-

09:03.237 --> 09:05.102
Lana Lang.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.598
Nametag was a big clue.

09:09.843 --> 09:13.176
So good luck finding
your missing old person.

09:19.520 --> 09:24.219
Enjoy your coffee.
They brought it in by burro this morning.

09:24.391 --> 09:26.859
Thanks, honey. You're a doll.

09:43.310 --> 09:47.110
You play beautifully.

09:48.515 --> 09:50.915
I was supposed to attend
the Metropolis Conservatory.

09:51.118 --> 09:56.954
Your voice sounds young. The conservatory
closed its doors in the '70s.

09:59.259 --> 10:03.252
I mean, I've always dreamed of attending
there. If I'd lived in a different time.

10:07.234 --> 10:11.398
Any chance you could give an old lady
a hand back to her room?

10:14.441 --> 10:15.840
I already know my future.

10:35.929 --> 10:39.421
You might consider rounding those curves at
a speed that won't break the sound barrier.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.467
- Where's the fun in that?
- Seriously. You could get hurt.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.661
Why the sudden interest in my health?

10:46.774 --> 10:50.540
I met this woman at the retirement center,
and she can kind of see the future.

10:50.711 --> 10:54.238
- She tell you your future?
- Not exactly.

10:54.682 --> 10:57.583
She said someone
very close to me would...

10:57.751 --> 10:59.912
- Die?
- I know it sounds nuts...

11:00.087 --> 11:02.521
...but when you talk to her,
it's like she really knows.

11:02.690 --> 11:04.851
Clark, she knows when
she has a good audience.

11:05.025 --> 11:08.051
- You sound like my parents.
- That's gotta be a first.

11:09.663 --> 11:11.631
Lex, I think this woman is the real deal.

11:11.799 --> 11:14.768
Well, then the question
you gotta ask yourself is:

11:14.935 --> 11:17.460
Do you really want to know the future?

11:17.638 --> 11:20.630
Don't you wish you knew
how it was all gonna turn out?

11:20.808 --> 11:23.743
Life's a journey. I don't want to
go through it following a road map.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.912
It still wouldn't kill you
to drive more slowly.

11:26.113 --> 11:30.072
Why? I have you as a friend.
You changed my future once, right?

11:36.090 --> 11:37.887
Got some more deliveries to make.

11:39.393 --> 11:43.352
- You never told me this woman's name.
- Thought you weren't interested.

11:44.098 --> 11:46.259
Maybe I'll ask her for some stock tips.

11:48.402 --> 11:50.734
Cassandra Carver.

11:56.677 --> 11:58.907
I don't think that's
gonna help bring Harry back.

11:59.079 --> 12:00.876
Clark, what are you doing here so late?

12:01.048 --> 12:05.382
I came to see Cassandra, if she's still up.
What happened to Harry's younger picture?

12:05.586 --> 12:07.281
I don't know.

12:08.489 --> 12:09.513
Is everything okay?

12:11.291 --> 12:15.387
I met with the administrator, you know,
to tell them what I knew about Harry.

12:15.562 --> 12:16.688
The police were there.

12:16.897 --> 12:19.388
Well, it's a missing person case.
It's not unusual.

12:19.600 --> 12:23.798
That's not the reason.
Harry Bollston's real name is Harry Volk.

12:24.171 --> 12:25.729
He was a murderer, Clark.

12:25.906 --> 12:28.739
A murderer? Why would they let
someone like that stay here?

12:28.942 --> 12:32.139
Because it happened 60 years ago,
when he was 17. He served his time.

12:32.312 --> 12:36.214
They figured he was just a harmless old man
who moved back to his hometown to die.

12:36.416 --> 12:39.681
Back in the '40s he was studying to be
a concert pianist. He was up...

12:39.853 --> 12:42.788
...for a full scholarship
to the Metropolis Conservatory.

12:42.956 --> 12:44.890
But his teacher recommended
somebody else.

12:46.393 --> 12:47.655
So he killed his teacher?

12:47.895 --> 12:54.130
No. He said the teacher killed his dream,
so he killed the teacher's dream.

12:54.301 --> 12:55.563
The man's son.

12:59.673 --> 13:01.800
<i>He's got three on the clock,
he'd better hurry.</i>

13:01.975 --> 13:07.811
Throw the ball! Throw the ball!
Watch the blitz! Yes! Yes!

13:08.015 --> 13:09.107
You got it!

13:11.652 --> 13:15.213
Damn it. Circuit breaker.

13:26.166 --> 13:29.932
Evening. Sorry about the trouble. We got
a faulty line about a mile down the road.

13:30.103 --> 13:33.436
I just wanted to make sure your
circuit breaker hadn't been fried.

13:37.644 --> 13:39.578
- Anybody else at home?
- No, I'm divorced.

13:39.746 --> 13:44.149
I saw the name on the account was
Jim Gage. Any relation to a Randolph Gage?

13:44.351 --> 13:48.515
Well, I'd say so. He was my father.
Passed back in '93.

13:48.689 --> 13:53.285
I remember reading his obituary. It said he
opened the first car dealership in Smallville.

13:53.493 --> 13:58.260
- In 1935. You got a good memory.
- Thanks. I had a lot of time to kill.

13:58.432 --> 14:01.196
We got three dealerships
in three counties now.

14:05.539 --> 14:09.100
Sounds like your father
left you a bright future.

14:18.952 --> 14:23.821
Are you gonna come in or not, Mr. Kent?

14:24.558 --> 14:27.118
- How do you do that?
- When one sense goes...

14:27.294 --> 14:29.660
...the others get heightened.

14:30.063 --> 14:35.091
I must admit, after yesterday,
I thought I'd never see you again.

14:35.602 --> 14:37.661
Sit.

14:44.311 --> 14:46.438
What you told me
I can't get out of my head.

14:46.613 --> 14:51.107
Imagine how I feel.
When it first started happening...

14:51.285 --> 14:54.448
...I thought it was a curse.

14:54.621 --> 14:59.752
I kept getting snapshots
of things I couldn't control.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.396
- When did they start?
- When I first lost my sight.

15:03.597 --> 15:07.897
It's funny. I woke up
that morning like any other.

15:08.602 --> 15:10.433
Then the meteors came.

15:10.637 --> 15:16.576
One hit a field behind my house,
the flash burnt my optic nerves.

15:17.077 --> 15:20.205
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

15:21.581 --> 15:26.541
It's amazing how one moment
can change your life forever.

15:30.590 --> 15:33.081
My friends and family,
they think that you're-

15:33.293 --> 15:34.624
A fraud?

15:35.929 --> 15:39.990
People are afraid of the unknown, Clark.

15:40.167 --> 15:44.627
They only want to know if everything's
gonna turn out all right.

15:45.105 --> 15:49.838
I can't guarantee that.
What I can show you...

15:50.043 --> 15:55.447
...are signposts on your journey.
What you do with them is up to you.

15:57.851 --> 16:01.014
I've got so many questions in my life,
I just want some answers.

16:04.624 --> 16:06.683
Closer.

16:13.333 --> 16:17.099
Now, take my hand.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.520
No.

16:42.929 --> 16:45.454
No!

16:48.201 --> 16:51.568
No!

16:53.540 --> 16:55.167
No.

16:55.375 --> 16:59.209
You saw that too. Clark?

17:08.688 --> 17:11.555
Clark, maybe you were having
some kind of hallucination.

17:11.724 --> 17:14.990
It wasn't a hallucination, it was
a glimpse of the future. My future.

17:15.162 --> 17:17.323
And you saw an endless graveyard.

17:17.497 --> 17:19.362
Like I was the last person on earth.

17:19.532 --> 17:22.525
Look, son, I don't know what
you did or didn't see, but, come on...

17:22.702 --> 17:24.693
- ... you gotta consider the source.
- Your dad's right.

17:24.871 --> 17:26.395
We don't know anything about her.

17:26.573 --> 17:28.507
I know she lost her vision
in the meteor shower.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.575
And that makes it so that
she can predict the future?

17:31.745 --> 17:36.239
Is it so crazy? I'm hit by a car and I'm fine, I
walk through fire and I'm okay. What's next?

17:36.416 --> 17:39.749
You can't let this one image
consume your whole life.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.912
What if it is my destiny,
to outlive everyone that I love?

17:43.090 --> 17:44.785
I don't wanna be alone.

17:50.664 --> 17:52.359
Clark.

17:53.667 --> 17:57.967
- I don't know what your future holds.
- I think this woman has the answers.

17:58.171 --> 18:01.572
The only person who controls
your destiny is you.

18:01.775 --> 18:04.869
Well, right now I don't feel like
I have control of anything.

18:14.554 --> 18:16.988
Cassandra Carver?

18:17.657 --> 18:23.061
Do those expensive shoes
come with a name?

18:23.363 --> 18:25.263
Lex Luthor.

18:27.033 --> 18:30.560
Of Luthor... Everything Incorporated?

18:31.104 --> 18:32.162
More or less.

18:32.339 --> 18:37.436
And what does the savior of Smallville
want with an old, blind woman?

18:37.644 --> 18:40.238
You seem to have made an impression
on my friend Clark.

18:40.447 --> 18:43.507
So you came to see for yourself.

18:44.317 --> 18:46.945
Clark's not stupid.
If he says you know things...

18:47.120 --> 18:49.350
...there must be something
that made him think that.

18:49.723 --> 18:52.351
What gives me the feeling...

18:52.526 --> 18:56.292
...you're not here for stock tips,
Mr. Luthor?

18:56.730 --> 19:02.498
Please, call me Lex. I was hoping you could
give me some insight into Clark.

19:02.836 --> 19:08.468
- And you call him a friend, do you?
- He saved my life, but he's also a mystery.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.173
Most people are.

19:11.344 --> 19:13.835
That's what makes them interesting.

19:14.047 --> 19:16.174
I'm willing to treat this
as a professional service.

19:17.317 --> 19:21.947
Save your money, Lex.
I can't tell you about Clark...

19:22.155 --> 19:24.715
...even if I wanted to.

19:24.925 --> 19:29.521
I can only tell the future
of the person I touch.

19:35.001 --> 19:36.628
I don't need to know my future.

19:36.836 --> 19:42.570
Why? Because your father already
has it mapped out for you?

19:43.009 --> 19:45.170
I believe we make our own destiny.

19:45.345 --> 19:49.714
And don't you want a glimpse
of what it is you'll make?

19:49.916 --> 19:53.716
Maybe I'll see your friend Clark, or...

19:53.887 --> 19:57.584
Maybe I'll see something else.

20:00.026 --> 20:03.427
Goodbye, Ms. Carver.
It's been enlightening.

20:08.068 --> 20:12.971
Come back again. When you're ready.

20:21.248 --> 20:23.239
Chloe, what-?

20:23.950 --> 20:25.417
She's not back yet.

20:26.286 --> 20:29.653
- Lana, what are you doing here?
- Chloe called me too. She said she had...

20:29.823 --> 20:35.693
...some info on Harry. When I got here,
I started looking around.

20:35.862 --> 20:37.557
Found this.

20:39.399 --> 20:41.060
Chloe calls it the "Wall of Weird."

20:41.268 --> 20:44.897
She believes everything strange in Smallville
started with the meteor shower.

20:45.639 --> 20:48.199
How about you, Clark?
Do you believe that?

20:50.176 --> 20:51.541
Yeah, I guess I do.

20:53.246 --> 20:55.146
Does that include me?

20:55.315 --> 20:59.376
I'm up there with the three-headed calf
and the monster from Crater Lake.

20:59.552 --> 21:02.419
The stuff on this wall
has nothing to do with you.

21:03.089 --> 21:05.819
Remember when you said people
keep their darkest secrets hidden?

21:08.595 --> 21:10.790
Mine's out there for all the world to see.

21:11.064 --> 21:14.329
It's hard when everyone knows
your tragedy. They treat you differently.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.161
Like you're gonna break.

21:16.369 --> 21:19.736
- I'm sure they just feel bad and wanna help.
- I know. But all they do...

21:19.939 --> 21:23.033
...is remind you of the
most painful moment of your life.

21:24.678 --> 21:26.441
How would that make you feel, Clark?

21:30.150 --> 21:33.176
Like I wish I could go back in time
and erase that moment forever.

21:37.424 --> 21:40.552
I thought high school would be different,
that I could finally start...

21:40.727 --> 21:45.289
...putting it behind me.
But everywhere I go, there it is.

21:46.833 --> 21:49.028
Maybe I should just accept my destiny.

21:49.336 --> 21:54.103
All I'm ever gonna be is a little girl in a
fairy-princess costume who lost her parents.

21:56.076 --> 21:58.704
I don't see you that way.

21:59.913 --> 22:02.746
I know you don't, Clark.

22:02.916 --> 22:04.941
You're the only one who doesn't.

22:22.402 --> 22:24.597
Clark, we got your message.

22:24.771 --> 22:26.261
Hey, where were you?

22:26.439 --> 22:28.634
<i>I thought we were all supposed
to meet at the Torch.</i>

22:28.808 --> 22:32.801
- Sorry. I didn't mean to blow you guys off.
- Will the lovely Ms. Lang be joining us?

22:33.012 --> 22:36.140
No, I think she had enough weirdness
for one day. What have you got?

22:36.316 --> 22:40.412
Guy was found dead in his house. He was
blindfolded and strangled with a piano wire.

22:40.587 --> 22:43.784
Which is the same signature
Harry Volk used in 1945.

22:43.957 --> 22:45.254
Sounds like a copycat.

22:45.425 --> 22:48.360
A copycat of a murder that happened
60 years ago, two days after...

22:48.528 --> 22:50.860
...the original killer disappears?
I don't think so.

22:51.064 --> 22:54.727
Harry's in a wheelchair. Not exactly
in prime condition to go on a crime spree.

22:54.934 --> 22:57.402
Well, I found this picture of Harry
from the '40s.

22:57.704 --> 23:01.265
- Looks like the kid we saw in the Beanery.
- Maybe he's got a grandson or something.

23:01.441 --> 23:02.806
Or maybe it's Harry.

23:02.976 --> 23:05.843
I don't think we should start looking
for time machines just yet.

23:06.012 --> 23:08.139
Okay, fine. Where do you think
we should start?

23:08.314 --> 23:12.774
If someone is following in Harry's footsteps,
maybe they sent him fan mail.

23:30.136 --> 23:31.865
We close at 9, Mozart.

23:35.809 --> 23:37.071
Your piano needs tuning.

23:37.277 --> 23:40.246
That's because nobody's played it in years.

23:40.513 --> 23:44.415
- You want to settle up?
- Can I get one more coffee?

23:46.553 --> 23:47.986
Don't you have somewhere to go?

23:48.188 --> 23:50.748
Oh, come on. You can clean up
to the sounds of Chopin.

23:54.194 --> 23:56.287
I guess.

24:04.504 --> 24:06.472
What if someone sees us
searching Harry's room?

24:06.639 --> 24:10.905
- How about we don't get seen?
- Clark, is that you?

24:11.578 --> 24:15.105
Harry's room is down the hallway.
I'll meet you there.

24:18.585 --> 24:21.952
The other night you left in a hurry.

24:22.121 --> 24:24.089
Sit.

24:27.694 --> 24:30.060
I hoped you'd come back.

24:30.230 --> 24:32.255
I'm sorry.

24:33.199 --> 24:36.191
You saw that...
Whatever it was.

24:37.437 --> 24:43.467
I always see them.
The question is, how did you?

24:44.978 --> 24:50.314
- I don't know. Wasn't I supposed to?
- Nobody ever has.

24:53.419 --> 24:57.719
- Why me?
- Because we both know...

24:57.891 --> 25:00.951
...you're not like other people.

25:01.995 --> 25:05.294
- Sure I am.
- No, Clark, I've seen you.

25:05.465 --> 25:07.399
Before we ever met.

25:07.600 --> 25:13.903
More than once, I've touched people
and I've seen such...

25:14.073 --> 25:16.564
...pain and despair and-

25:16.743 --> 25:21.407
But then you were there
and the pain was gone.

25:23.116 --> 25:26.608
I think that's your destiny, Clark.

25:26.786 --> 25:32.315
To help people, to save them
from fear and darkness.

25:32.492 --> 25:36.223
- How?
- Well, that's for you to figure out.

25:36.696 --> 25:41.395
You can fear the future or...

25:41.568 --> 25:43.536
...you can embrace it.

25:46.906 --> 25:49.602
The choice is yours.

26:10.163 --> 26:14.293
- Who are they?
- People who need your help.

26:16.235 --> 26:18.396
How can I help them
if I don't know who they are?

26:18.605 --> 26:24.908
I'm not a radio. I don't pick up continuous
transmissions. That's all I have.

26:27.013 --> 26:29.140
I'll figure it out.

26:29.916 --> 26:33.977
Clark. Your secret's safe with me.

26:43.596 --> 26:45.086
You guys have any luck?

26:45.264 --> 26:49.064
<i>No fan mail, just a bunch of old news
clippings from the Smallville Ledger.</i>

26:49.235 --> 26:52.466
Obituaries, articles.

26:52.639 --> 26:55.403
Guy's been obsessed with Smallville
for 50 years.

26:55.808 --> 26:57.935
- Clark, is something wrong?
- It's her.

26:58.144 --> 27:00.977
- It's who?
- I've gotta go.

27:11.858 --> 27:17.296
Thanks for the serenade, but unless
you're sleeping here, which you're not...

27:17.664 --> 27:19.689
...I'm heading out.

27:21.067 --> 27:24.264
- What's this?
- They don't teach Greek in school anymore?

27:24.504 --> 27:29.339
It's Euripides."The sins of the father
are visited on the children."

27:29.676 --> 27:35.546
You play Beethoven and you speak Greek.
Real cute. What's it got to do with me?

27:35.748 --> 27:39.343
Actually, Zoe Garfield, quite a bit.

27:41.020 --> 27:47.448
Your grandmother, Eve Garfield,
she died last year, right?

27:47.627 --> 27:53.224
I was meant for big cities,
great concert halls. That was my destiny.

27:53.433 --> 27:57.870
And your grandmother,
she helped kill that future.

27:58.071 --> 27:59.402
And now...

28:02.308 --> 28:03.707
...I'm gonna kill yours.

28:12.185 --> 28:15.848
- Let her go!
- Don't move, don't move, don't move!

28:26.265 --> 28:28.199
I said, let her go.

28:30.136 --> 28:32.900
Didn't your parents teach you
to respect your elders?

28:42.381 --> 28:44.281
Oh, no!

28:46.219 --> 28:48.187
Take care of her.

29:32.866 --> 29:38.361
Zoe's gonna be okay, but that
truck driver could have sworn he hit you.

29:38.538 --> 29:41.974
- Don't worry, he's not asking any questions.
- Is that kid in jail?

29:42.142 --> 29:44.576
No, he's in the hospital
overnight for observation.

29:44.845 --> 29:46.437
Does Zoe know why
he wanted to kill her?

29:46.646 --> 29:49.046
She's just grateful you happened
to come along.

29:49.216 --> 29:51.878
- Is that what you told the police?
- I figured they wouldn't want to hear...

29:52.052 --> 29:56.512
- ... I got a vision from an old, blind lady.
- I'm not sure how I feel about Cassandra.

29:56.690 --> 30:00.251
Mom, she's my friend.
She told me my destiny was to help people.

30:00.460 --> 30:03.258
You don't think she knows your secret?

30:07.167 --> 30:10.568
- I don't think you should see her anymore.
- If I hadn't seen her, Zoe would be dead!

30:10.771 --> 30:13.831
Your destiny may be to protect people,
but ours is to protect you...

30:14.007 --> 30:15.736
...and that's gotta come first, okay?

30:17.878 --> 30:20.244
My mom said you called?

30:20.714 --> 30:22.545
Is this the Porsche from-?

30:22.716 --> 30:24.843
I don't understand.
Why do you still have it?

30:25.018 --> 30:29.580
I once read about a rich man
who survived a hotel fire.

30:29.790 --> 30:34.489
He hung onto the ledge for an hour
before the fire department rescued him.

30:34.661 --> 30:40.293
Afterwards, he bought the hotel.
Always stayed in that room.

30:40.467 --> 30:44.836
When they asked him why, he said
he figured fate couldn't find him twice.

30:45.005 --> 30:47.132
I thought you didn't believe in fate.

30:47.340 --> 30:51.003
I don't. But every time
I look at this car, I wonder.

30:53.980 --> 30:56.278
I had a team go over this thing
inch by inch.

30:56.483 --> 31:00.613
They tell me there's no way the impact
could have ripped open the roof like this.

31:01.755 --> 31:04.155
They must have made a mistake.

31:05.659 --> 31:07.650
Do you remember anything
about the accident?

31:09.529 --> 31:11.690
No, just that I pulled you out, that's it.

31:13.033 --> 31:15.968
I thought you might be able
to tell me more.

31:16.470 --> 31:17.698
I'm sorry.

31:19.473 --> 31:22.738
It's a little strange to be walking around
when every shred of evidence...

31:22.909 --> 31:26.606
...says I should be dead.
An unsolved mystery, I guess.

31:26.813 --> 31:28.678
Maybe fate has something else
in mind for you.

31:31.184 --> 31:33.618
You've been spending
too much time with Cassandra.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.617
At least she doesn't dwell on the past.

31:38.658 --> 31:40.125
Lex, you're alive.

31:40.293 --> 31:44.195
The question that you need to ask yourself
now is, where do you go from here?

31:47.601 --> 31:51.093
I'm here to pick up the kid from the
Beanery assault, take him into custody.

31:51.271 --> 31:54.729
Right, the young John Doe. He's all yours.
We've got him locked up in here.

31:54.908 --> 31:58.036
I checked on him this morning.
He's sleeping like a baby.

32:04.084 --> 32:06.518
Help me.

32:06.753 --> 32:08.550
The police questioned Harry
all morning.

32:08.722 --> 32:11.850
He said he was kidnapped by this kid
who was obsessed with his old case.

32:12.058 --> 32:14.754
Somehow, in broad daylight,
this kid got out of handcuffs...

32:14.928 --> 32:17.328
...smuggled Harry inside
and chained him to a bed?

32:17.497 --> 32:19.226
That's the official story.

32:19.399 --> 32:21.492
It may be official,
but it doesn't make sense.

32:22.836 --> 32:24.667
You can always add it
to the Wall of Weird.

32:31.044 --> 32:33.239
Clark, are you all right?

32:33.413 --> 32:39.784
Not really. I think I'll go inside
and talk to Harry.

32:52.332 --> 32:55.768
You know, I found a picture of Zoe Garfield
in a box under your bed.

32:56.036 --> 32:59.062
- And who are you?
- Clark Kent, but we've already met.

32:59.272 --> 33:01.763
How dare you go through my belongings.

33:02.042 --> 33:05.239
- How do you explain the pictures?
- And why do I need to explain them?

33:05.445 --> 33:07.242
You know what, Harry?

33:08.982 --> 33:12.076
I think you and this kid are the same person.

33:13.086 --> 33:16.578
I'd say you have a very active imagination.

33:16.790 --> 33:18.781
I don't know how you did it,
but I know it's you.

33:20.293 --> 33:23.626
You said your name was Kent?

33:23.797 --> 33:27.255
Grandfather, Hiram. Father, Jonathan.

33:27.901 --> 33:33.066
Funny. I don't remember you
on the family tree.

33:34.808 --> 33:36.105
I'll be watching you.

33:38.445 --> 33:40.606
Nurse?

33:41.514 --> 33:47.350
Nurse! Help me, somebody! Help!

33:48.355 --> 33:54.783
Oh, nurse! Nurse, he's harassing me.
Haven't I been through enough?

33:54.995 --> 33:59.193
- I think you should leave, young man.
- Don't worry, I'm going.

34:30.397 --> 34:34.128
<i>This is everything I could find on Harry Volk.
The Ledger carried stories on the trial...</i>

34:34.301 --> 34:36.292
...the murder, the investigation, you name it.

34:36.469 --> 34:39.165
- Is anybody watching this guy?
- Lana's got an eye on him.

34:41.507 --> 34:43.237
I heard that.

34:43.443 --> 34:45.672
- What exactly are we looking for?
- I don't know.

34:45.879 --> 34:48.609
There's gotta be a connection
between the people Harry's going after.

34:48.782 --> 34:53.047
In Zoe Garfield's statement, she said Harry
accused her grandmother of killing his future.

34:55.155 --> 34:58.989
Harry's gone. They found his wheelchair
out by the koi pond half an hour ago.

34:59.492 --> 35:01.016
I saw meteor rocks in that pond.

35:01.227 --> 35:03.161
At least now we know
how he's doing the time warp.

35:03.363 --> 35:06.196
- What do you mean?
- I'll explain later.

35:06.366 --> 35:08.163
We gotta figure out
who he's gonna kill next.

35:09.703 --> 35:12.365
- Clark, take a look at this.
- What is it?

35:12.539 --> 35:14.404
List of the jurors
that worked on Harry's trial.

35:15.008 --> 35:18.136
Randolph Gage, Rita Garfield...

35:18.311 --> 35:20.871
He's killing the descendents
of the jurors who convicted him.

35:21.081 --> 35:22.548
Talk about not letting it go.

35:24.584 --> 35:27.348
- Clark, what is it?
- Look at juror number 11.

35:32.325 --> 35:35.260
Hiram Kent. Wasn't that your grandfather?

35:35.695 --> 35:37.060
Harry's gonna kill my dad.

35:39.632 --> 35:42.100
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, got a report about a gas leak.

35:42.268 --> 35:44.896
You mind if I come in?

35:47.774 --> 35:50.334
Gas leak. I don't smell gas.

35:50.543 --> 35:52.943
Your husband called about it earlier.
Is he around?

35:53.146 --> 35:56.775
He'll be back shortly.
Where's our regular gas man, Kurt?

35:56.983 --> 36:00.077
- Vacation.
- That's right.

36:00.253 --> 36:02.312
Would you excuse me a minute?

36:20.473 --> 36:23.442
Kurt isn't your regular gas man,
is he, Mrs. Kent?

36:24.611 --> 36:27.546
- What do you want?
- Kill your husband.

36:28.314 --> 36:31.283
- What did Jonathan ever do to you?
- Nothing.

36:32.619 --> 36:33.881
But his father did.

37:23.770 --> 37:28.537
Come on, Mrs. Kent!
I'm too old for hide-and-seek!

37:49.229 --> 37:51.629
Jonathan!

37:53.867 --> 37:56.734
You can't save him, Mrs. Kent.

38:37.844 --> 38:40.005
- Clark!
- Are you okay?

38:40.179 --> 38:42.170
- What's the matter?
- Where's Mom?

38:42.382 --> 38:44.907
- I don't know.
- Somebody's trying to kill you.

38:45.084 --> 38:46.142
What?

38:50.023 --> 38:51.456
He's already here.

39:17.483 --> 39:18.780
No!

39:21.955 --> 39:25.948
Martha. Martha!

39:26.159 --> 39:29.128
Mom! Mom!

39:29.495 --> 39:30.894
Martha, come on!

39:31.064 --> 39:32.622
Mom, come on! Mom!

39:34.400 --> 39:35.389
Martha!

39:35.768 --> 39:38.737
- Come on, Mom, breathe!
- Martha!

39:47.880 --> 39:49.677
Are you okay?

39:51.050 --> 39:53.644
You think I'd ever leave you two alone?

40:00.159 --> 40:03.287
Cassandra was wrong, Clark.

40:04.731 --> 40:07.529
Nobody's gonna die.

40:18.378 --> 40:23.782
Well. You're the last person
I expected to walk through my door.

40:23.983 --> 40:26.952
I come bearing gifts.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.088
So did the Greeks.

40:30.757 --> 40:32.748
I wanted to take you up on your offer.

40:33.359 --> 40:36.726
I thought you controlled
your own destiny.

40:37.196 --> 40:42.896
I do. But certain things have happened
in my life, signs I don't want to ignore.

40:43.102 --> 40:46.868
- What kind of signs?
- I lived when I should have died.

40:47.240 --> 40:51.700
There must be a reason for that.
You see, I don't want to do good things.

40:51.878 --> 40:55.939
- I want to do great things.
- Well, you don't need me for that.

40:56.949 --> 41:00.441
What's the matter, Cassandra?
Are you afraid of what you'll see?

41:01.521 --> 41:03.580
Sit.

41:06.659 --> 41:11.494
Well. You've been warned.

42:19.932 --> 42:21.524
What did you see?

42:47.226 --> 42:49.956
I need some help in here!

42:53.065 --> 42:55.158
Somebody?

42:55.968 --> 42:57.902
Ms. Carver?

43:11.184 --> 43:13.846
I'm sorry, son, she's gone.

43:17.790 --> 43:20.588
- She saw it.
- Saw what?

43:22.428 --> 43:24.623
Her future.
