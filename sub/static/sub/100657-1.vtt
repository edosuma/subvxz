00:05.483 --> 00:10.053
-Dust welcomes you to a special
viewing experience.

00:10.053 --> 00:13.839
We thank you for joining us
to explore the depths

00:13.839 --> 00:18.888
of the unknown in a dark,
isolated, and quiet place --

00:18.888 --> 00:20.759
the ocean.

00:20.759 --> 00:25.460
It goes largely unexplored,
and yet holds so much.

00:25.460 --> 00:29.899
A different life exists beneath
its undulating surface.

00:29.899 --> 00:32.206
You may have sensed its edges,

00:32.206 --> 00:35.035
ventured only to
a shallow depth,

00:35.035 --> 00:41.345
but science is our most curious
passenger, and it seeks more.

00:41.345 --> 00:44.044
This is "Sea Fever."

02:40.421 --> 02:42.336
-Oh, thank you!

02:42.336 --> 02:44.164
-Aw, nice to meet you!

02:44.164 --> 02:45.948
Good to see you.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.558
-Did you get some cake?

02:47.558 --> 02:50.909
-Not joining in?

02:50.909 --> 02:52.520
-I don't do joining in.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.131
Look, this parasite isn't hadal.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.654
It's in totally the wrong place.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.656
-No, you are in totally
the wrong place!

02:58.656 --> 03:00.267
What time are you supposed
to be on board?

03:00.267 --> 03:03.400
-3:00? But this important,
Professor.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.010
-And your doctorate isn't?

03:07.274 --> 03:09.145
-You wouldn't fail me
for not going?

03:09.145 --> 03:11.800
-I would have no choice.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.716
Off you go.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.762
-But I-I know my strengths,
I'm a good observer,

03:17.762 --> 03:19.460
I'm good at seeing patterns.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.723
-You are an excellent scientist.
That's not in question.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.073
-I need my own space,
I can't do other people.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.075
This environment is much more
in the form of --

03:26.075 --> 03:29.034
-Siobhan! There's some birthday
cake over here.

03:32.908 --> 03:36.433
-Do you have any friends
in this department?

03:36.433 --> 03:38.130
-But I --
-Get going!

03:38.130 --> 03:41.743
Get your hands dirty,
make a few friends.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.585
-As I was starting to think you
weren't coming!

03:57.585 --> 03:59.021
-Sorry.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.241
-Skipper would have my guts
for garters.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.764
-That's a horrible thought!

04:04.722 --> 04:07.334
There she is!
Niamh Cinn-Oir!

04:09.553 --> 04:10.859
She's here!

04:10.859 --> 04:13.122
Okay...

04:21.391 --> 04:25.265
-Trick is, don't think,
just jump.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.006
Go on, give her a hand.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.279
-Siobhan, this is my auntie
Ciara.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.934
-You're the scientist, I hear.

04:42.934 --> 04:46.068
She's a charmer!

04:46.068 --> 04:48.549
-Have I ever let you down?

04:48.549 --> 04:51.900
Apart from the times
I let you down, I mean.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.424
-We'll need a miracle.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.298
-Want to meet our student?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.996
-Ah, here she is at last.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.954
I am Gerard the skipper,

05:02.954 --> 05:05.522
this is Freya, the real boss.

05:05.522 --> 05:08.699
She's a Viking.
Keeps us all afloat.

05:08.699 --> 05:10.310
-Siobhan, is it?

05:12.660 --> 05:15.489
Gerard?
Don't forget to talk to Omid.

05:15.489 --> 05:18.361
-Johnny.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.726
-You're getting worried
about this.

05:35.726 --> 05:40.383
-It's our water,
it's important.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.864
-So when's the heir to
the throne arriving?

05:42.864 --> 05:45.823
-Three weeks.
-Oh, yeah?

05:45.823 --> 05:47.869
Then I'm definitely gonna start
looking for something else.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.698
-So your job is up
for grabs, huh?

05:50.698 --> 05:54.354
-Take it easy now, I said
I'm gonna start looking.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.921
-Yeah, you're always
saying that.

05:56.921 --> 05:59.402
-Alright, lads?

05:59.402 --> 06:01.404
Good to go?
-Yeah.

06:01.404 --> 06:06.931
Just, uh, checked over his work,
made some corrections.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.412
-Now listen,

06:09.412 --> 06:13.198
we owe you money.
-Aw, great.

06:13.198 --> 06:16.288
-You'll get your last share
on top of this share.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.203
-What?
-Soon as we get back,

06:18.203 --> 06:21.076
you have my word.
Sound okay?

06:21.076 --> 06:22.904
-Eh...

06:22.904 --> 06:24.819
Skip, you know,
I have the baby coming.

06:24.819 --> 06:28.518
-I know, I know.
You'll get your shares.

06:28.518 --> 06:33.175
Are we good to go?

06:33.175 --> 06:34.524
-Yeah.
-Alright!

06:34.524 --> 06:36.831
I'll make it up to ya!

06:36.831 --> 06:41.531
-We need a big
fucking haul this time.

06:41.531 --> 06:45.448
-So, what's your work?

06:45.448 --> 06:48.799
-Well, um...

06:48.799 --> 06:51.628
I identify and extrapolate
patterns

06:51.628 --> 06:54.326
from variations in deep sea
faunal behavior.

06:54.326 --> 06:57.373
Then I generate algorithms
and computer simulations

06:57.373 --> 07:00.420
to predict ecological outcomes.

07:00.420 --> 07:04.119
-I meant what is your work while
you're on board?

07:04.119 --> 07:07.862
-I need to photograph your
catch, look for anomalies.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.299
-Won't be hard.
We get all sorts.

07:10.299 --> 07:13.389
-And, um, I need to
do a short dive.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.783
-Like under water?

07:15.783 --> 07:19.569
-Do you dive?

07:19.569 --> 07:22.093
-Fishermen don't swim.
-Why not?

07:25.706 --> 07:27.534
-'Cause it's better to go fast.

07:27.534 --> 07:30.362
Nobody wants to drown slow.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.248
-Uh. Sudi!
You haven't met Siobhan.

07:49.164 --> 07:52.384
Fucking hell, man!

07:52.384 --> 07:54.648
-Well she's pleased to meet you
too, mate.

07:54.648 --> 07:58.565
-Does the skipper
know about this?

07:58.565 --> 07:59.957
-He does now!

08:04.135 --> 08:07.704
-A redhead.
-We've already spent her fee.

08:07.704 --> 08:11.360
-I know, but we can't
afford any bad luck.

08:14.145 --> 08:17.148
-So you think the color
of my hair is bad luck?

08:17.148 --> 08:19.542
-Oh, well there's two
schools of thought on that.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.676
-I can't change what I am.

08:22.676 --> 08:26.506
-I know, I know, but um...
Maybe just...?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.508
Not such a bad idea.

08:37.778 --> 08:40.607
-Anchors away.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.652
Alright then.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.069
-Pick a bunk!

09:12.726 --> 09:15.163
-Why only four bunks?
-Oh, shift work.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.121
Three people sleep
and three people work.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.559
-How long's a shift?
-You get about 2 hours sleep.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.909
-What? Sleep loss effects
cognition.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.868
-Oh, talk to me!
-You get emotional outbursts.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.696
-I barely know who
I am by the end.

09:26.696 --> 09:29.307
-Even psychosis?

09:29.307 --> 09:33.050
-Sea fever.
Happens.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.836
-Eejit, come on.
You're not on shift.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.926
-Protect us, oh, Lord, from
all the perils of the deep.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.058
My Christ who filled the nets
of his disciples

09:41.058 --> 09:43.060
deliver us safely back to
harbor.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.106
-Amen.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.391
-Make your last calls,

10:09.391 --> 10:12.481
we'll be out of coverage
in a few minutes.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.064
-Fisheries are in.

10:34.285 --> 10:37.288
Look at that.

10:37.288 --> 10:40.727
-Yes. Yes. Yes!

10:40.727 --> 10:42.729
-Our water filtration system.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.340
You spend years at sea and
always have fresh water.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.603
It's magic.
-Magic?

10:47.603 --> 10:50.388
Where'd you go to school?
-Same place as she did!

10:50.388 --> 10:52.303
Our doctoral student, Siobhan.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.957
-How many filters?

10:53.957 --> 10:57.482
-Eh, three.
Ascending gauges.

10:57.482 --> 11:03.532
-Ionizer?
-There.

11:03.532 --> 11:06.317
-You designed this?
-Yes.

11:06.317 --> 11:09.756
Yeah, I did.
-It's brilliant.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.672
Why don't you have a better job?

11:15.065 --> 11:16.980
-Don't be fooled by her
winning personality,

11:16.980 --> 11:19.417
she can be quite blunt.
-No, I...

11:19.417 --> 11:21.419
I just mean for such a talented
engineer,

11:21.419 --> 11:23.770
it's a low status job.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.642
-Yeah, well you know, I...

11:26.642 --> 11:29.863
I have been waiting for the
right opportunity I guess.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.125
Hey, don't touch that!

11:31.125 --> 11:32.822
-Ooh!
-Are you okay?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.476
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Yeah, sure?

11:34.476 --> 11:36.826
-She needs a place to work.
-Not in here, I'm sorry.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.262
Too dangerous.
-I'm not hurt.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.134
-I'm afraid I might be.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.575
-I don't mind you working there.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.446
It's not always quiet, but --

11:48.446 --> 11:50.710
-Oh, it's great, thank you.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.718
-Are you cold?

12:03.853 --> 12:06.638
Mother of Jesus, a redhead.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.254
Take that thing off ya.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.778
You're here now,
we better get used to ya.

12:20.696 --> 12:23.177
-Niamh Cinn-Oir
to Coast Guard. Over.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.353
-Freya, did you pick
up my e-mail?

12:25.353 --> 12:27.964
Coordinates are for the
exclusion zone. Over.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.191
-Fuck!

12:37.191 --> 12:40.281
Bang on top of our fish!

12:40.281 --> 12:44.067
-Okay. We'll steam through
the exclusion zone. Over.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.721
-No, not allowed.

12:45.721 --> 12:50.682
Whales and calves in the area.
Over.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.902
-Roger that. Over and out.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.296
-Good luck out there.
Coast Guard out.

12:55.296 --> 12:58.647
-There goes our catch.

12:58.647 --> 13:01.389
-We'll get the hassars.

13:39.035 --> 13:42.386
-Oh, you don't want it? Okay.

13:42.386 --> 13:46.303
-Um...

13:46.303 --> 13:48.436
-Are ya hungry?

13:48.436 --> 13:51.047
-No! No, no, no, no. I'm fine.
I'll just um...

13:51.047 --> 13:54.529
I'll uh...

14:58.985 --> 15:00.900
-Turn it off!

15:14.826 --> 15:16.741
-You out here every night?

15:23.748 --> 15:25.489
Oh, come look, come!

15:34.977 --> 15:37.153
-It's a bioluminescent
phytoplankton.

15:40.548 --> 15:43.159
-It's one of the stories of
Niamh Cinn-Oir.

15:43.159 --> 15:46.249
She was so sad about losing her
lover Oisin,

15:46.249 --> 15:49.209
she gave herself to the sea.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.776
-Drowned herself?

15:51.776 --> 15:53.517
-No.

15:53.517 --> 15:57.130
No. She is immortal.

15:57.130 --> 16:00.263
That's her hair,
lights up the sea.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.472
-Thanks.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.839
-Wow!

16:54.839 --> 17:02.108
Out here?

17:02.108 --> 17:04.545
Whales on starboard,
lads.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.460
-What?

17:06.460 --> 17:08.897
What?

17:08.897 --> 17:11.465
-Oh, yeah, look!
-Yeah, I can see!

17:11.465 --> 17:14.642
-There's two of them.

17:14.642 --> 17:17.036
Can you see it?
-Yeah, yeah, I see it!

17:17.036 --> 17:19.299
-And I think there's a calf.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.865
-Look there's another one,
just behind.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.432
-Can you not see them?

17:22.432 --> 17:24.826
-No, I can, it's um...

17:24.826 --> 17:27.698
It's just that whales aren't
usually around fishing lanes.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.613
They don't like the noise.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.500
Something's wrong.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.502
-Don't start that.
Whales are a good omen.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.286
-Whales are a very good omen.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.158
-Another shoal dead ahead,

17:52.158 --> 17:58.120
less than a mile.
It's a big one.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.342
-Freya?

18:02.342 --> 18:03.647
-What?

18:03.647 --> 18:08.652
-That shoal's moving
pretty fast.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.310
-You alright?
-Oh, Jesus Christ!

18:20.751 --> 18:23.754
-Jesus, what did we hit?!

18:23.754 --> 18:26.540
-Omid, what's the damage
down there?

18:26.540 --> 18:30.979
Omid? Omid?

18:30.979 --> 18:34.374
-Yeah, uh, can you send down
the student?

18:44.906 --> 18:46.777
-Siobhan?

18:57.701 --> 19:00.139
-Hey, something's changing
the texture of the wood.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.678
-We letting in?

19:17.678 --> 19:20.550
-No, no, we're okay.

19:31.648 --> 19:36.610
-Go get the small gauge timber
plugs. Now.

19:36.610 --> 19:40.179
Come on, fast, now!

19:40.179 --> 19:42.703
Tell me you know what that is?

20:01.722 --> 20:03.724
-It's like we're caught
on something!

20:11.471 --> 20:15.518
Niamh Cinn-Oir to Coast Guard,
come in.

20:15.518 --> 20:18.739
Niamh Cinn-Oir to Coast Guard,
come in?

20:29.271 --> 20:33.536
You took us into
the exclusion zone.

20:57.038 --> 20:59.562
-What is that?

20:59.562 --> 21:01.825
-Chemical spill, maybe?

21:14.360 --> 21:16.492
-What's happening?
-I don't know!

21:16.492 --> 21:18.451
-Are we sinking?
-I don't know!

21:18.451 --> 21:20.235
-What?
-Siobhan, Jesus Christ!

21:20.235 --> 21:23.412
-Are we sinking?
-We are not sinking.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.414
-You're a fucking eejit,
do you know that?

21:25.414 --> 21:29.549
Christ knows what we're tangled
up in. It could be anything!

21:44.303 --> 21:48.002
-Good Jesus...

21:48.002 --> 21:51.397
Is this what's stopping us
moving?

21:51.397 --> 21:53.616
-Yeah, something's getting
through the hole.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.452
-Christ!

22:23.777 --> 22:28.042
What is that?

22:28.042 --> 22:33.439
-Could be a species
of barnacle.

22:33.439 --> 22:36.006
-Do you have your scuba gear
on board?

22:36.006 --> 22:37.443
-I do.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.401
-And you have to do
a dive anyway.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.925
-Yes.
-So you could do your dive

22:41.925 --> 22:43.840
and take off
the barnacles for us.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.364
-But that could be anything!

22:45.364 --> 22:48.454
-It's what you're here for,
anomalies, no?

22:52.675 --> 22:55.809
-Here, listen.
I've got you, yeah?

23:02.468 --> 23:04.644
-It's a gutting knife.

23:04.644 --> 23:07.081
-Just do your best.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.473
-I'm never going back down
there again!

25:18.473 --> 25:19.953
-What?
-What happened?

25:19.953 --> 25:21.650
-Describe what they looked like.

25:26.612 --> 25:30.050
-What?
-It's...

25:30.050 --> 25:31.617
It's -- It's one animal.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.575
It's one huge animal.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.142
-Wait, what, as well as the
barnacles?

25:35.142 --> 25:38.972
-No, i-i-it's not barnacles,
it's um...

25:38.972 --> 25:40.713
It's connective tissue.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.802
-Connected to what?
-Like tendrils,

25:42.802 --> 25:44.760
like, like a lot of tendrils.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.806
-Water's cloudy, she doesn't
know what she saw.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.373
-Freya...
A squid!

25:49.373 --> 25:51.332
Bet you it's some kind of squid.

25:51.332 --> 25:54.857
-It's more like some kind of
cnidarian, but um...

25:54.857 --> 25:56.555
It could be a squid.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.034
But if it's a squid,
it's bigger,

25:58.034 --> 25:59.819
it's bigger than anything on
record --

25:59.819 --> 26:01.995
It's -- It's huge!
-Giant squid!

26:01.995 --> 26:03.953
-You want the winch?
-Oh, yeah!

26:03.953 --> 26:06.739
All hands on deck, come on!
-No...!

26:11.744 --> 26:13.136
Please!

26:13.136 --> 26:15.617
We need to call for help.
-We'll be fine.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.751
Squid can't hold their own
bodyweight in shallow water.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.840
We lift it even a bit,
it'll have to loosen

26:20.840 --> 26:23.146
its grip on the boat.
That's how we get free.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.974
-Johnny, winch her up.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.255
Keep it going.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.711
-Gerard.

27:05.711 --> 27:09.192
-Let go of the winch.

27:23.424 --> 27:25.513
-Oh, fuck...Oh, fuck!

27:25.513 --> 27:28.255
-Right, someone hit the brake!

27:28.255 --> 27:31.911
-Get the fucking brake!
-Ow!

27:33.695 --> 27:36.393
Fuck! Ow!

27:42.835 --> 27:44.227
-Sorry, sorry...

27:44.227 --> 27:46.882
Sorry. Take it easy.
Easy, easy now!

28:20.742 --> 28:22.744
-There's another boat!
-What?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.485
-That way!

28:30.404 --> 28:32.275
-Bastards.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.364
-You're unbelievable.

28:37.454 --> 28:40.675
We'd have to split the profits.

28:40.675 --> 28:45.027
They might have a better winch.

28:45.027 --> 28:47.551
-And a radio.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.656
-Gerard can't row over there
on his own.

29:05.656 --> 29:08.572
-I'm not getting in beside that
thing. No way.

29:08.572 --> 29:11.488
-It's a bad idea. Let's just
wait for the Coast Guard.

29:11.488 --> 29:14.404
-Come on!
Big commercial boat over there,

29:14.404 --> 29:16.189
they'll be able to help us.

29:19.496 --> 29:21.150
-I'll go.

29:24.675 --> 29:28.854
-I'll go as well.
-No.

29:28.854 --> 29:31.334
-Ger... Three of us.

30:11.026 --> 30:13.550
-Hello?

30:13.550 --> 30:17.293
Anyone aboard?

30:31.090 --> 30:33.353
Fine mesh trawling.

30:33.353 --> 30:37.313
Desperation makes you do things.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.576
-Hello?

30:41.448 --> 30:42.797
Hello?

30:48.281 --> 30:49.804
They smashed the radio.

30:49.804 --> 30:51.850
Why would they do that?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.764
I don't understand.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.418
-Shh, listen.

30:58.073 --> 30:59.335
-I can't hear anything.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.120
-That's what I mean.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.867
-We should just go.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.912
-Hello?

31:14.350 --> 31:16.875
Johnny, go on.

31:29.713 --> 31:33.108
Come on, Siobhan.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.767
-Hello?

32:26.857 --> 32:29.382
Hello?

32:46.486 --> 32:48.314
-Jesus Christ...!

32:48.314 --> 32:50.577
Fucking hell.

32:57.758 --> 33:00.108
Must have gone mad.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.122
-Oh my God...!

33:17.386 --> 33:20.737
-Oh...! Fuck...

33:22.739 --> 33:24.524
-Sea fever.
-What?

33:24.524 --> 33:28.049
-No sleep. One fella loses it.
Spreads like wildfire.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.573
-That might explain the suicide,
but the eyes?

33:30.573 --> 33:32.488
-Might've been the birds.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.935
Listen, say nothing about this.

33:44.935 --> 33:47.242
-Nothing at all?
-Nothing at all!

33:50.811 --> 33:52.943
-How will we get home now?

34:14.052 --> 34:15.488
-Omid?

34:36.465 --> 34:38.815
-Hey, how'd it go?
They have a winch?

34:38.815 --> 34:40.774
-Ah, they've their own problems.

34:40.774 --> 34:43.255
No help at all.

34:43.255 --> 34:45.431
-We wanna show you guys
something.

34:49.957 --> 34:52.481
That thing let us go,
we're free!

34:52.481 --> 34:55.267
-Didn't I tell you we'd be fine?
Ha!

35:22.468 --> 35:25.035
-Animals don't trap
something and just let it go.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.473
-Maybe it got injured when
we tried winching it up?

35:27.473 --> 35:29.692
-Could have secreted something
defensive, I suppose.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.173
-Sounds plausible.
-Or venom.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.001
-And we're immune.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.829
-Or a digestive substance.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.527
-And the boat's inedible.

35:38.527 --> 35:42.270
-Large mass heading
this way, lads.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.577
-Or it's coming back for us.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.762
-Freya, we've no catch.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.242
-And if that thing
grabs onto us?

35:57.242 --> 35:58.678
-We'll net it before
it gets near us.

35:58.678 --> 36:01.463
We know now.

36:01.463 --> 36:02.725
-God, it's a risk.

36:02.725 --> 36:06.381
-Have I ever let you down?
Huh?

36:06.381 --> 36:09.471
Listen, if you want, we can --
we can steam home right now.

36:09.471 --> 36:13.214
But if we do that,
we'll lose the boat.

36:13.214 --> 36:15.651
We'll lose the boat.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.184
-Shoot the net.
-Yeah!

37:03.090 --> 37:06.006
-Yes!

37:06.006 --> 37:08.226
-We're on a roll!

37:08.226 --> 37:10.402
-Woo!

37:10.402 --> 37:12.012
So, what'll you do with
your shares?

37:12.012 --> 37:15.276
-Parts for the new bike.
-Ah, Omid's old rust bucket?

37:15.276 --> 37:17.060
-Hey, come on, it's a good bike.

37:17.060 --> 37:20.760
-Hey! It's not a bike.
It's a love machine.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.284
-What's her name? Alice...?

37:23.284 --> 37:24.894
-Alison O'Reilly.
-O'Reilly!

37:24.894 --> 37:27.549
-Alison O'Reilly.

37:27.549 --> 37:30.248
-We're hitting the highway.
Just need a new sump.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.859
-Sump. Every girl's dream.

37:32.859 --> 37:35.557
-Oh God...Fuck.

37:41.607 --> 37:45.393
-You okay?

37:45.393 --> 37:47.830
-No, actually,
I'm bloody knackered.

38:14.944 --> 38:17.164
-Is it always like this?

38:17.164 --> 38:19.427
-No. Sometimes it's scary.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.650
Things happen at sea.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.478
-Yeah, but things
like that other boat?

38:26.478 --> 38:28.436
-Coast Guard'll deal with it.
And listen, I've seen worse.

38:28.436 --> 38:31.396
-You've seen worse?!

38:31.396 --> 38:33.746
-Look.

38:33.746 --> 38:36.488
Can I give you some advice?

38:36.488 --> 38:38.098
Listen, we're here.

38:38.098 --> 38:41.275
We're safe so just...
Let it go.

38:41.275 --> 38:43.233
For a minute.

38:43.233 --> 38:44.844
Rest.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.983
-What would I do instead?

38:57.552 --> 38:59.815
Are you making a pass at me?

38:59.815 --> 39:01.730
-No.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.253
-'Cause I've had people make
passes at me before!

39:03.253 --> 39:05.821
-Yeah, I'm sure you have...
-No, I mean --

39:05.821 --> 39:08.215
What I mean is...

39:08.215 --> 39:11.740
It would be okay if you were.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.661
-Best catch we've
had in months.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.010
Bad luck's streak's
finally over.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.751
-Yeah, it was about
fuckin' time!

39:22.751 --> 39:25.928
-Hey, hey, guys.
-Oh, bollocks!

39:25.928 --> 39:27.843
-Watch your head, man!
-Hey, is there no free towel?

39:27.843 --> 39:30.498
-You already took a shower.
Look at you, man!

39:30.498 --> 39:32.195
-Slime on me,
that shit is everywhere.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.894
-Johnny, your auntie said you're
on kitchen duty tonight.

39:34.894 --> 39:36.765
-Yep. Sounds about right.

39:36.765 --> 39:39.464
-Hey, you guys okay?

39:44.947 --> 39:47.515
-Hey, come on, sit down.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.482
-Omid.
-Yeah?

39:57.482 --> 39:59.832
-Are you ready for the
responsibilities of fatherhood?

39:59.832 --> 40:01.573
-You look hot.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.879
-Thank you. I was going to
say the same about you

40:03.879 --> 40:05.315
but you got there first, so.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.882
-I mean you might have a fever.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.841
-Nah, I just had a shower.

40:08.841 --> 40:10.582
-Yeah, for fucking half an hour!

40:10.582 --> 40:13.106
-You smell that guys?
You smell something?

40:13.106 --> 40:14.977
Oh, it's the shit from --

40:14.977 --> 40:18.590
-Excuse me, excuse me! Have you
looked in the mirror lately?

40:18.590 --> 40:20.461
There's this black thing
on your face!

40:20.461 --> 40:22.985
-Everyone, everyone.
Redhead or not,

40:22.985 --> 40:24.683
best student we've ever had,

40:24.683 --> 40:26.206
am I right?
-Hear hear!

40:26.206 --> 40:28.774
-Nerves of steel!
-Yeah, she is.

40:28.774 --> 40:31.254
-Yeah, as long as she's not
trying to find the winch brake!

40:31.254 --> 40:33.387
-Sure, you were worse.

40:33.387 --> 40:35.520
-We had to teach you
how to eat spaghetti.

40:35.520 --> 40:39.219
-No, spaghetti is stupid and you
know it, okay? You know...!

40:39.219 --> 40:40.742
-Hey, who was it that nearly

40:40.742 --> 40:42.352
destroyed the engine, huh?
-No, I'm going...!

40:42.352 --> 40:44.311
-Let his rope fall
around the propeller.

40:44.311 --> 40:47.009
-Rope around the prop.
It was bad.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.924
-It jammed. Killed the engine.
-Hey, at least I make a good

40:48.924 --> 40:50.665
ship's engineer one day, right?

40:50.665 --> 40:54.408
-Anyway, here's to the best
student we've ever had.

40:54.408 --> 40:55.801
-Cheers to that.

41:00.849 --> 41:02.634
-You okay?

41:08.248 --> 41:10.293
Come on, let's go for a swim.

41:13.993 --> 41:16.474
-Wait, what did he say?

41:16.474 --> 41:18.606
-He said he wants to go
for a swim.

41:21.261 --> 41:24.090
-Well fucking stop him!
-Jesus Christ.

41:24.090 --> 41:27.223
-Where's he going?

41:30.792 --> 41:32.707
-Johnny, stop.
-I'm fine! I'm fine!

41:32.707 --> 41:34.448
Leave me alone. I'm fine.
We're going in,

41:34.448 --> 41:36.450
we're going...
We're going for a dip.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.757
Look, 30 seconds, it's just
a dip basically isn't it?

41:38.757 --> 41:40.976
-Don't!
-Come on.

41:40.976 --> 41:43.022
-We're going swimming.
-You're not going in.

41:43.022 --> 41:45.024
-No, no, no!
-You're not going in.

41:45.024 --> 41:46.895
-I'm grand!

41:46.895 --> 41:49.637
-Take it easy now, come on.

41:49.637 --> 41:52.379
-Lunatic. There's a
motherfucking monster out there!

41:52.379 --> 41:56.296
-What kind of eejit goes diving
off a trawler to impress a girl?

41:59.560 --> 42:03.129
-What the fuck, Johnny?
-What are you on?

42:03.129 --> 42:05.435
-Nothing.

42:05.435 --> 42:07.133
-If you brought drugs
onto this boat...!

42:07.133 --> 42:08.656
-I didn't and I wouldn't.

42:08.656 --> 42:10.832
-Did you give him something?
-No, he's hot.

42:10.832 --> 42:13.487
I think his hand might be
infected.

42:13.487 --> 42:16.708
-Let me see your hand.
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

42:16.708 --> 42:19.101
I need to sleep is all.

42:24.672 --> 42:27.066
-Johnny, would you like me
to look at your eye?

42:45.998 --> 42:47.869
-What?

42:47.869 --> 42:50.959
-I think I saw something.
-Let me see.

42:50.959 --> 42:52.613
Come here now.

43:01.361 --> 43:03.145
Can't see anything.

43:03.145 --> 43:04.799
-Bloody hell, you nearly
had me going there.

43:04.799 --> 43:07.672
-Jumping at shadows.
Relax the head. You...!

43:07.672 --> 43:11.414
Get some sleep.

43:17.943 --> 43:21.120
-Right, well, I'm just
gonna...over here...

43:54.980 --> 43:56.982
Fuck!

43:56.982 --> 43:59.288
-Jesus, Johnny!

43:59.288 --> 44:01.029
Take it easy!

44:01.029 --> 44:04.903
-Let me see, let me see!
-What is it?

44:04.903 --> 44:07.253
-You're okay, take it easy!

44:07.253 --> 44:13.259
-I-I... I can't --
I can't see.

44:24.879 --> 44:29.014
-Johnny!

44:29.014 --> 44:32.104
-No! Noooo!
Oh, God!

44:32.104 --> 44:34.280
-Shhh!
-Help! Let me up, please.

44:34.280 --> 44:35.977
-What is it?

44:38.023 --> 44:41.200
Johnny, Johnny, shh!

44:41.200 --> 44:46.292
You're okay.

44:46.292 --> 44:49.948
Oh, my God!

44:49.948 --> 44:54.082
Oh, Johnny!

44:54.082 --> 44:55.997
Oh, Jesus!

45:08.357 --> 45:10.359
-Move back.
Don't touch anything!

45:10.359 --> 45:12.013
Move back! Move back!

45:12.013 --> 45:15.016
Come with me, right now.
Come with me.

45:18.541 --> 45:22.023
-I love you.

45:22.023 --> 45:25.113
-Listen, um, they were
parasites in his eyes.

45:25.113 --> 45:28.073
-What? How?
-They went into the water.

45:28.073 --> 45:30.249
-I'll go turn it off.

45:30.249 --> 45:31.729
-Where's Sudi?

45:39.301 --> 45:41.695
-Sudi! Turn off the shower!

45:41.695 --> 45:44.263
-Fuck off!
-We're not fucking joking!

45:44.263 --> 45:46.395
Turn off the shower now!

45:46.395 --> 45:50.269
Sudi! Sudi?!

45:50.269 --> 45:52.532
Sudi, please! Listen to
me! Open up the door!

45:52.532 --> 45:54.926
-Oi! Bastards!

45:54.926 --> 45:56.579
-Now Sudi!
Turn off the shower!

45:56.579 --> 45:58.625
Turn off the water!
Hey, listen to me.

45:58.625 --> 46:00.279
Open the door.

46:00.279 --> 46:04.022
Open the door right now!

46:04.022 --> 46:06.633
Sudi! Sudi, please,
listen to me!

46:13.596 --> 46:15.816
Alright. You're alright.
You're alright.

46:15.816 --> 46:18.514
It's okay.

46:18.514 --> 46:20.299
Come here.

46:28.437 --> 46:29.874
-Okay...

46:29.874 --> 46:32.746
Shhh...Johnny...

46:32.746 --> 46:36.271
I have ya.
You're okay.

46:36.271 --> 46:40.188
You're okay.

48:32.431 --> 48:34.433
-Straight through the steel.

48:53.582 --> 48:56.194
Jesus Christ!

49:06.465 --> 49:09.120
Oh! Agh!

49:09.120 --> 49:10.469
Fuck!

49:10.469 --> 49:14.429
It's okay, it's the filter.

49:14.429 --> 49:17.215
-Where does this flow to?

49:23.525 --> 49:26.354
Nothing can get in or out now.

49:26.354 --> 49:29.270
Except through the lid.

49:29.270 --> 49:31.925
-We need to open it.

49:31.925 --> 49:33.448
-Are you crazy?

49:33.448 --> 49:39.411
-If I can identify them
it'll be helpful.

49:39.411 --> 49:41.456
-Put these on.

49:47.332 --> 49:50.857
Hey, please, careful.

50:13.532 --> 50:15.534
What are they?

50:15.534 --> 50:18.015
-I don't know.
But I think...

50:18.015 --> 50:22.149
Maybe they're larvae.

50:22.149 --> 50:25.674
-We need to get those things
out of the tank.

50:25.674 --> 50:27.633
-So empty it!

50:27.633 --> 50:29.374
What are you waiting for?
Fuck's sake!

50:29.374 --> 50:31.245
-How? We've no pump.
-Exactly.

50:31.245 --> 50:33.378
And we need fresh water.
-We'll boil it.

50:33.378 --> 50:34.988
-And what do we do
for drinking water?

50:34.988 --> 50:36.859
-Fish them out of the tank!

50:36.859 --> 50:39.166
-They bit through the steel
water filters.

50:39.166 --> 50:41.386
-They'll probably be dead
in the next few hours.

50:41.386 --> 50:44.432
-Alright, alright.
We're all grieving.

50:44.432 --> 50:45.868
What did you say?

50:45.868 --> 50:47.479
-If I'm right --

50:47.479 --> 50:50.612
they're saltwater larvae
in fresh water.

50:50.612 --> 50:54.834
They'll be dead
in the next few hours.

50:54.834 --> 50:57.315
-Right. She's -- She's right.

50:57.315 --> 50:58.838
-Did Johnny get
bitten like this?

50:58.838 --> 51:00.970
-No! No, he didn't.

51:00.970 --> 51:03.147
Let's just focus, huh?

51:03.147 --> 51:06.063
-What did they say,
on the other trawler, huh?

51:10.371 --> 51:13.592
-Nothing.
They're all dead.

51:19.337 --> 51:21.904
-It was sea fever.
They took their own lives.

51:21.904 --> 51:25.169
Alright?
Now...

51:25.169 --> 51:27.084
We need to keep our
heads clear, yeah?

51:27.084 --> 51:28.824
Omid,

51:28.824 --> 51:32.176
get Sudi to bed.
And um...

51:34.743 --> 51:37.485
-You and Siobhan
will check the water

51:37.485 --> 51:39.183
in two hours time.
-Okay, good.

51:39.183 --> 51:43.448
We'll say a prayer
for Johnny at dawn.

51:43.448 --> 51:48.322
Let's all get some rest now.
You take first watch.

51:48.322 --> 51:51.934
-What?
-She's fine, Ciara.

52:04.425 --> 52:08.951
-Okay?
Yeah? There you go.

52:08.951 --> 52:12.259
-She doesn't even
know my name, man.

52:12.259 --> 52:14.696
Alison O'Reilly.

52:14.696 --> 52:17.351
I haven't even spoken to her.

52:17.351 --> 52:20.398
-What are you talking about?

52:20.398 --> 52:25.490
-I was just waiting
for the right time.

52:25.490 --> 52:27.144
-The right time?

52:30.843 --> 52:33.628
-And then you...

52:42.681 --> 52:44.465
-You're alright.

52:44.465 --> 52:46.685
-I just can't believe...

53:15.496 --> 53:17.890
-It's time.

53:52.968 --> 53:55.710
-Are they dead?
-I think we're good.

53:55.710 --> 53:59.584
-Yeah?

54:15.774 --> 54:18.559
Not long til they eat
through the tank.

54:18.559 --> 54:20.953
-They're weaker. I think
there's fewer of them.

54:20.953 --> 54:22.911
We'll just have to wait.

54:26.828 --> 54:30.919
-He who puts himself
in my hands,

54:30.919 --> 54:32.443
though he were dead,

54:32.443 --> 54:35.315
yet shall he live,

54:35.315 --> 54:38.492
and whosoever trusts in me,

54:38.492 --> 54:41.582
shall never die.

54:47.849 --> 54:50.112
-Se do bheatha, a Mhuire,
ata lan de ghrasta,

54:50.112 --> 54:52.245
Ta an Tiarna leat.
Is beannaithe thu idir mna,

54:52.245 --> 54:54.291
Agus is beannaithe toradh
do bhroinne; Iosa.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.554
-Have you something
to help you sleep?

55:01.515 --> 55:03.517
Listen, burn the engine
if you have to.

55:03.517 --> 55:07.173
Just get us home fast.

55:42.948 --> 55:44.950
-What are you doing?

55:52.436 --> 55:54.176
-You're still bleeding.

55:59.443 --> 56:01.662
-Everything is fuzzy.

56:07.668 --> 56:09.453
Is this what happened
to Johnny?

56:09.453 --> 56:11.237
-No, he had a fever.

56:11.237 --> 56:13.892
You've just lost a lot of blood,
so it's affecting your eyes.

56:13.892 --> 56:15.589
-You mean I'm going blind?

56:15.589 --> 56:18.157
-Yes, might be temporary.
-Might be?!

56:18.157 --> 56:20.638
-Listen, I'm sorry,

56:20.638 --> 56:24.206
I can't help you right now.
I need to focus.

56:24.206 --> 56:26.470
-Fucking redhead.

56:26.470 --> 56:29.342
None of this would have
happened without you!

56:29.342 --> 56:32.258
-You're confusing
coincidence and cause.

56:32.258 --> 56:35.000
My hair and this happening
is coincidence, but...

56:40.614 --> 56:42.399
It was the slime!

56:42.399 --> 56:44.705
The thing that attached
itself to the boat.

56:44.705 --> 56:47.055
It mistook our boat
for an animal.

56:47.055 --> 56:48.492
Probably a whale.

56:48.492 --> 56:50.102
And when it latched onto us,

56:50.102 --> 56:52.583
i-it produced a progenerative
substance.

56:52.583 --> 56:54.585
And Johnny had an open wound.

56:54.585 --> 56:58.023
-So, uh, the slime got into
Johnny's blood

56:58.023 --> 57:00.025
and there were eggs
in the slime?

57:00.025 --> 57:02.114
-Not were -- are.

57:02.114 --> 57:04.856
They're still alive.

57:04.856 --> 57:08.294
Sudi's got open wounds,
we've all got cuts.

57:08.294 --> 57:12.037
We're all vulnerable to get
infected just like Johnny.

57:12.037 --> 57:13.778
If we're not already.

57:16.911 --> 57:18.347
-Any good news?

57:18.347 --> 57:20.437
-We need to kill those eggs
right now.

57:20.437 --> 57:22.656
-Fucking how?!
-I don't know!

57:22.656 --> 57:25.790
I study behavior patterns
in a lab.

57:25.790 --> 57:28.314
You kill things.

57:31.230 --> 57:33.319
-Give it here.

57:40.195 --> 57:42.763
Here.

57:42.763 --> 57:45.505
-This won't work.

57:45.505 --> 57:47.507
-So what do we do?

57:51.119 --> 57:53.252
-Can you make a UV light?

57:53.252 --> 57:55.210
-Why?

57:55.210 --> 57:58.213
-Other hadopelagic species,
their spawn,

57:58.213 --> 58:00.346
you can kill it with intense
UV light.

58:03.218 --> 58:05.003
-You have a smart phone?

58:05.003 --> 58:09.094
I learnt this in a bar
at Tishreen University.

58:09.094 --> 58:10.748
-Where's that?

58:10.748 --> 58:12.532
-Syria.

58:14.752 --> 58:18.103
-You met your wife there?

58:18.103 --> 58:20.453
-How'd you guess?
-I don't guess.

58:20.453 --> 58:23.151
I study behavior patterns.

58:23.151 --> 58:25.893
You were touching
your wedding ring.

58:30.942 --> 58:34.772
It's tiny.
-Just do the test.

58:34.772 --> 58:38.210
We can figure out how to
make it bigger later.

59:03.017 --> 59:05.324
-It's too tiny anyway.

59:09.676 --> 59:12.636
How long til we're home?

59:12.636 --> 59:15.639
-I'd say about 30 hours.

59:15.639 --> 59:18.555
-We'll all be infected by then.

59:33.613 --> 59:35.093
Omid.

59:39.532 --> 59:42.796
I have another stupid idea.

59:42.796 --> 59:44.232
-Are you mad?

59:44.232 --> 59:45.582
Disinfectant doesn't
kill the eggs,

59:45.582 --> 59:48.628
UV light doesn't either.

59:48.628 --> 59:51.196
-So you want
to electrocute the Niamh?

59:51.196 --> 59:53.894
-Yes.
We use the ARC welder.

59:53.894 --> 59:58.769
Sea water as a conductor and run
a current around the boat.

59:58.769 --> 1:00:00.814
Come on, as long as we're
all wearing rubber boots

1:00:00.814 --> 1:00:02.207
there's no risk to us.

1:00:02.207 --> 1:00:03.861
-And you'll take
responsibility?

1:00:03.861 --> 1:00:06.211
-Hold on!

1:00:06.211 --> 1:00:08.692
What about the motors?
The engine?

1:00:08.692 --> 1:00:11.564
-I'll try and insulate them.

1:00:11.564 --> 1:00:14.349
-Oh, you'll try!

1:00:14.349 --> 1:00:16.917
And what about the risk of fire?

1:00:21.443 --> 1:00:23.358
Are you insane?

1:00:23.358 --> 1:00:25.230
No!

1:00:25.230 --> 1:00:27.928
Fucking no!

1:00:27.928 --> 1:00:29.582
You can't risk my boat!

1:00:29.582 --> 1:00:31.018
-It's a risk either way.

1:00:31.018 --> 1:00:35.196
You risk the boat or
you risk our bodies.

1:01:12.930 --> 1:01:16.194
-Fuck's sake!
This is insane!

1:01:16.194 --> 1:01:20.198
-Pretty sure Omid'll
sort it out.

1:01:20.198 --> 1:01:22.809
-Okay. Do it.

1:02:00.281 --> 1:02:02.240
-Omid?

1:02:30.398 --> 1:02:32.096
-Are we on fire?

1:02:32.096 --> 1:02:35.273
-No, it's just...just surface
electrics.

1:03:40.773 --> 1:03:42.688
-Did it work?

1:03:42.688 --> 1:03:46.823
-I think so.
-Thank you.

1:03:46.823 --> 1:03:49.086
-We can go ashore once
we know we're clear.

1:03:52.306 --> 1:03:54.482
-We areclear.

1:03:54.482 --> 1:03:59.357
-It took Johnny at most 36 hours
from exposure.

1:03:59.357 --> 1:04:02.403
So obviously we have
to wait 36 hours

1:04:02.403 --> 1:04:05.232
from when we destroyed the eggs.
-We're making port tonight.

1:04:05.232 --> 1:04:07.713
-Freya, if any of us
is infected, then --

1:04:07.713 --> 1:04:09.454
-Then we'll be better off
in hospital.

1:04:09.454 --> 1:04:13.110
-Freya, wait!
You know Christmas Island?

1:04:13.110 --> 1:04:15.112
-What?
-It has the world's

1:04:15.112 --> 1:04:18.289
biggest population of red crabs,
it used to.

1:04:18.289 --> 1:04:20.900
-So?
-So, a few yellow ants arrived

1:04:20.900 --> 1:04:24.121
and they blinded the red crabs.
Just a few ants.

1:04:24.121 --> 1:04:26.210
Now there aren't
anymore red crabs.

1:04:26.210 --> 1:04:28.212
Do you see what I mean?

1:04:28.212 --> 1:04:31.345
-Yeah. The crabs should
have gone to hospital.

1:04:31.345 --> 1:04:33.782
-This is what I do.

1:04:33.782 --> 1:04:36.350
Faunal behavior in spe--
-Yes, in a lab.

1:04:36.350 --> 1:04:38.875
But this is the real world,
with real people!

1:04:38.875 --> 1:04:41.007
-And in the real world,
if we go ashore

1:04:41.007 --> 1:04:42.487
and one of us is a carrier,

1:04:42.487 --> 1:04:44.576
then those things will spread,
really fast.

1:04:44.576 --> 1:04:46.883
-Sudi is my responsibility.

1:04:46.883 --> 1:04:48.275
And he's bleeding
to death in there.

1:04:48.275 --> 1:04:50.712
-We can't just think about Sudi.

1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:56.762
I am not losing
one more crew member.

1:05:01.245 --> 1:05:02.942
-Omid, I need your help.

1:05:02.942 --> 1:05:04.770
-Yeah, what?

1:05:04.770 --> 1:05:07.642
-When we get to port, help me
keep everyone on the boat.

1:05:07.642 --> 1:05:09.644
-That'll never happen.

1:05:09.644 --> 1:05:12.299
First sniff of land, we'll
all be off and gone.

1:05:12.299 --> 1:05:15.302
-Just until we know
we're not infected!

1:05:15.302 --> 1:05:17.217
-Have you seen Sudi?

1:05:17.217 --> 1:05:18.392
Have you seen him?

1:05:18.392 --> 1:05:21.134
He needs help now.

1:05:21.134 --> 1:05:22.788
-Where do you live?

1:05:24.311 --> 1:05:25.704
Galway.

1:05:25.704 --> 1:05:27.401
-200,000 people
in Galway, right?

1:05:27.401 --> 1:05:29.099
-Yeah, it's about that.
-Yeah. We can't say

1:05:29.099 --> 1:05:30.970
we're so important that it's
worth risking the lives

1:05:30.970 --> 1:05:32.885
of 200,000 people.

1:05:32.885 --> 1:05:34.669
-Yeah, maybe.

1:05:34.669 --> 1:05:37.281
But who are you to say that
this poor kid has to die

1:05:37.281 --> 1:05:39.500
so someone else
can avoid the risk?

1:06:04.308 --> 1:06:09.269
-Are my eyes open or closed?

1:06:09.269 --> 1:06:11.184
-Open.

1:06:21.412 --> 1:06:23.892
Shh, you'll be alright.

1:06:23.892 --> 1:06:27.157
Shhhh.

1:06:27.157 --> 1:06:31.509
You'll be alright.

1:06:45.131 --> 1:06:47.003
Sudi?

1:07:27.043 --> 1:07:30.046
-God is our hope and strength.

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:32.483
God is our hope.

1:07:32.483 --> 1:07:34.267
We will not fear,

1:07:34.267 --> 1:07:37.401
though we be in
the midst of the sea,

1:07:52.111 --> 1:07:58.074
-God is with us,
and we will not be removed.

1:07:58.074 --> 1:08:01.947
Amen.

1:08:21.793 --> 1:08:23.534
-We need to quarantine
ourselves now.

1:08:23.534 --> 1:08:26.014
-Maybe you've no life,
but we have responsibilities.

1:08:26.014 --> 1:08:29.627
-Listen.
Omid's wife is pregnant.

1:08:29.627 --> 1:08:31.324
We need to get them home.

1:08:31.324 --> 1:08:32.978
-If they want, they can
get themselves to hospital.

1:08:32.978 --> 1:08:35.546
Now seriously, fuck off!
-But you don't understand!

1:08:35.546 --> 1:08:37.374
-Did you not hear me?!

1:08:37.374 --> 1:08:39.332
Huh?!

1:09:09.884 --> 1:09:11.799
-You okay?

1:09:43.135 --> 1:09:45.398
How's Ger?

1:09:45.398 --> 1:09:48.836
-Not infected if that's
what you mean.

1:10:02.937 --> 1:10:05.897
-Aw, no.
Oh, no, no, no!

1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:18.214
Fucking...Fuck...
Come here.

1:10:29.268 --> 1:10:31.575
-Why has the engine stopped?

1:10:31.575 --> 1:10:33.011
-Tell them.

1:10:33.011 --> 1:10:36.144
-I disabled the boat.

1:10:36.144 --> 1:10:38.669
-What?

1:10:38.669 --> 1:10:40.584
-I disabled the boat.

1:10:40.584 --> 1:10:42.890
-Agh!
-Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1:10:42.890 --> 1:10:45.415
-What the fuck's your problem?!

1:10:45.415 --> 1:10:48.026
-We've all got cuts.
-But we killed the eggs!

1:10:48.026 --> 1:10:49.897
-We could have got infected
before that!

1:10:49.897 --> 1:10:52.900
-So we get help!
-There is no help!

1:11:01.344 --> 1:11:03.433
-So...

1:11:03.433 --> 1:11:06.044
You want us to sit
out here and die?

1:11:06.044 --> 1:11:08.829
-I want us to stay on the boat
until we're sure

1:11:08.829 --> 1:11:10.353
that none of us is infected.

1:11:10.353 --> 1:11:14.052
-Your bloody 36 hours.
-It's not mine.

1:11:14.052 --> 1:11:19.449
It's your family's.

1:11:19.449 --> 1:11:22.887
It's your husband's,
it's your baby's.

1:11:22.887 --> 1:11:24.758
Blame me if you want.

1:11:24.758 --> 1:11:26.760
We have to take action.

1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:29.807
We have to take responsibility.

1:11:55.049 --> 1:11:58.923
-Listen,
I know I caused this.

1:12:00.751 --> 1:12:02.361
-Don't.

1:12:07.279 --> 1:12:10.630
I let you do it.

1:12:10.630 --> 1:12:15.069
We could have gone back home
when that thing let us go,

1:12:15.069 --> 1:12:17.115
but I kept us here.

1:12:17.115 --> 1:12:18.334
It's not all on you.

1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:24.514
God knows who's next.

1:12:30.041 --> 1:12:33.000
-You saw something in Johnny's
eye before he died, didn't you?

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.915
-Yes.

1:12:34.915 --> 1:12:37.265
-I want you to test all of us.

1:12:51.715 --> 1:12:53.499
-I don't see anything.

1:12:53.499 --> 1:12:55.588
-Want me to do you?
-Mm-hmm.

1:13:01.638 --> 1:13:04.554
-I don't see anything.
-Look again. It's really faint.

1:13:14.259 --> 1:13:15.608
-No, I don't see anything.

1:13:15.608 --> 1:13:18.568
-Do me.

1:13:18.568 --> 1:13:20.700
-Not you. Omid.

1:13:20.700 --> 1:13:22.963
-Come on. Just let her do it.

1:13:38.152 --> 1:13:39.806
-I think you're fine.

1:13:39.806 --> 1:13:42.026
-Okay. My turn.

1:13:50.991 --> 1:13:53.080
-I don't see anything.

1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:56.606
-Okay.
-She scuppered us for nothing.

1:13:56.606 --> 1:13:59.391
-You haven't done me.

1:13:59.391 --> 1:14:02.960
-I don't need to do you.

1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:06.093
-What?

1:14:06.093 --> 1:14:07.965
-Give me that thing.

1:14:33.512 --> 1:14:35.253
-Fuck!

1:14:35.253 --> 1:14:37.081
Oh, God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-It's alright, it's okay.

1:14:37.081 --> 1:14:39.562
It's okay, it's alright.

1:14:39.562 --> 1:14:44.784
-It's alright.
-No. No. Listen.

1:14:44.784 --> 1:14:47.657
That place.
-Gerard, no.

1:14:47.657 --> 1:14:49.659
-We weren't meant to be there.

1:14:49.659 --> 1:14:51.704
-What?
-What do you mean?

1:14:51.704 --> 1:14:54.707
-I changed course and I didn't
tell anyone.

1:14:54.707 --> 1:14:57.101
I took us into
an exclusion zone.

1:14:57.101 --> 1:14:59.886
-That's why we saw the whales.

1:14:59.886 --> 1:15:01.714
-Come on.

1:15:01.714 --> 1:15:03.803
-You changed course?
-I changed course.

1:15:03.803 --> 1:15:06.284
-So do the Coast Guards
know where we are?

1:15:10.854 --> 1:15:12.943
-Did you know about this?

1:15:12.943 --> 1:15:14.814
Hmm?

1:15:14.814 --> 1:15:17.469
-Ger, come on.
-Ciara...

1:15:17.469 --> 1:15:20.733
-I think you should go.
-Come on.

1:15:20.733 --> 1:15:23.344
-You fucking bastard!
-Stop it!

1:15:23.344 --> 1:15:25.259
-Johnny's dead!
-We're family!

1:15:25.259 --> 1:15:27.914
-Oh, yeah?
I had my own family.

1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:45.279
I'm so sorry.

1:15:45.279 --> 1:15:48.413
I'm sorry.

1:15:48.413 --> 1:15:50.807
I'm so sorry.

1:16:05.996 --> 1:16:09.434
-Little blondie head on her.

1:16:09.434 --> 1:16:12.611
Little Niamh.

1:16:12.611 --> 1:16:17.964
-I thought nothing this bad
could ever happen to us again.

1:16:17.964 --> 1:16:21.446
I don't mind going.

1:16:21.446 --> 1:16:23.883
'Cause I'll see her again.

1:16:27.670 --> 1:16:29.454
-Wait!

1:16:33.153 --> 1:16:36.722
Wait!

1:16:36.722 --> 1:16:38.115
Wait!

1:16:56.220 --> 1:17:00.006
-O, a chuisle...

1:17:33.170 --> 1:17:37.304
-Freya.

1:17:37.304 --> 1:17:38.915
Freya!

1:18:06.682 --> 1:18:08.596
-Are you taking a rowboat?

1:18:08.596 --> 1:18:10.120
-Double your chances
of being found.

1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:11.643
-Just stop, please! Listen!

1:18:11.643 --> 1:18:13.558
You're three fucking days
from shore in that thing!

1:18:13.558 --> 1:18:16.082
-Call it quarantine.
-Come on, Freya, please?

1:18:16.082 --> 1:18:18.128
-There's white spirit and stuff
in the forepeak.

1:18:18.128 --> 1:18:21.044
Make a flare. There's also
the inflatable boat.

1:18:21.044 --> 1:18:23.524
-Hey, please.

1:18:23.524 --> 1:18:26.745
What about the
Niamh Cinn-Oir, huh?

1:18:26.745 --> 1:18:28.878
-Do what you want with it.

1:18:28.878 --> 1:18:32.055
It's just a boat.

1:19:21.713 --> 1:19:23.889
-That's inside the boat.

1:19:45.650 --> 1:19:48.435
Freshwater?
They're alive in freshwater!

1:19:48.435 --> 1:19:50.307
That sounded like one animal.
-Yeah.

1:19:50.307 --> 1:19:52.309
-So they ate each other like
tadpoles. One animal wins.

1:19:52.309 --> 1:19:55.529
-How -- How do we get
the one animal out?

1:19:55.529 --> 1:19:56.835
-We stun it.

1:19:56.835 --> 1:19:58.445
We run electricity
through the tank.

1:19:58.445 --> 1:20:02.406
-No, that doesn't...
Only works in salt water.

1:20:02.406 --> 1:20:07.063
-Okay. Okay, okay.
It's a parasitic life cycle.

1:20:07.063 --> 1:20:08.804
It's hadopelagic.

1:20:08.804 --> 1:20:11.110
But pressure is not a problem.

1:20:11.110 --> 1:20:13.547
-Yeah?

1:20:13.547 --> 1:20:18.291
-It's um...

1:20:18.291 --> 1:20:20.728
It's hadopelagic.

1:20:20.728 --> 1:20:22.513
-Yeah, you said that.

1:20:22.513 --> 1:20:24.994
-So it likes the deep cold.
We heat the tank.

1:20:24.994 --> 1:20:26.865
-What, will that kill it?
-No.

1:20:26.865 --> 1:20:29.389
-But it will slow it down.
-Enough for us to kill it?

1:20:29.389 --> 1:20:32.001
-Enough for us to safely
return it to the wild.

1:20:32.001 --> 1:20:33.741
-Oh, wait, what like,
are you insane?

1:20:33.741 --> 1:20:35.439
-It's a rare animal.
-Yeah, so are we.

1:20:35.439 --> 1:20:37.702
-We're intelligent.
-T-That's debatable.

1:20:37.702 --> 1:20:40.270
-This is our duty!
It's in the wrong place.

1:20:40.270 --> 1:20:43.360
It only wants to survive.
Just like us.

1:20:43.360 --> 1:20:45.188
-So you risk dying
to protect something

1:20:45.188 --> 1:20:48.539
that wants to kill you?

1:20:48.539 --> 1:20:50.933
-How do we heat the tank?

1:21:12.563 --> 1:21:14.391
Let's find out.

1:21:20.310 --> 1:21:21.877
-Now?

1:21:32.713 --> 1:21:33.932
-Omid!

1:21:33.932 --> 1:21:37.501
-Agh!

1:21:49.687 --> 1:21:51.776
-Right through the hull.

1:22:00.611 --> 1:22:01.917
-Get the food.

1:22:01.917 --> 1:22:04.136
-We're sinking?
-We're sinking.

1:22:07.009 --> 1:22:09.098
-White spirit.

1:22:09.098 --> 1:22:11.448
We can make a beacon.
-With what?

1:22:16.757 --> 1:22:19.804
-Okay, you ready?

1:22:19.804 --> 1:22:21.719
-No.

1:22:24.722 --> 1:22:26.463
-Let's go.

1:22:40.999 --> 1:22:43.959
Omid! Hurry!

1:22:43.959 --> 1:22:46.004
-I-I can't swim!

1:23:13.162 --> 1:23:16.469
-Omid!

1:23:16.469 --> 1:23:17.818
Grab my hand!

1:23:17.818 --> 1:23:20.038
Grab my hand! Pull!

1:23:29.874 --> 1:23:31.832
No! No! Oh!

1:23:31.832 --> 1:23:33.965
Omid! Oh, carry on...!

1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:44.688
-Thank you!

1:24:44.688 --> 1:24:46.211
Thank you...

1:24:52.652 --> 1:24:55.525
Siobhan.

1:24:55.525 --> 1:24:58.310
Siobhan. Look! Look!

1:25:22.247 --> 1:25:24.031
I'm infected.

1:25:32.562 --> 1:25:34.912
-No. Let me see.

1:25:34.912 --> 1:25:43.138
Okay. We'll just...

1:25:43.138 --> 1:25:47.098
Okay, we'll, listen...

1:25:47.098 --> 1:25:54.018
We'll just...

1:25:54.018 --> 1:25:56.107
We'll just tourniquet
this area, okay?

1:25:56.107 --> 1:25:58.109
Stop the poison from spreading.

1:25:58.109 --> 1:25:59.719
Okay. Yeah?

1:25:59.719 --> 1:26:02.331
Hey. You might be immune.

1:26:02.331 --> 1:26:05.377
Okay? We're going home.

1:26:09.294 --> 1:26:12.689
-Okay.
-Omid...
