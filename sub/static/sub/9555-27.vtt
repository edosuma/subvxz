01:24.918 --> 01:26.147
No more times.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.311
Okay, thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:28.455 --> 01:29.923
That's it. Good-bye.
So long.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.149
Good.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.259
We've still got two hours left
to study.

01:33.393 --> 01:36.021
Guys, guys,
what is this, "Bye-bye."

01:36.163 --> 01:37.289
I mean, you're through playing?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.830
It's not even 4:00.

01:38.966 --> 01:41.333
Al, I'm sorry, we've got to cram
for our final exams.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.027
That's just the way
the burger burns, Al.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.036
Al, Al, Al.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.503
Al, cheer up.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.938
I don't have any exams
this week. I can still play.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.568
Chachi, people don't want
to dance to a drumbeat.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.612
They want to hear
a horn tooting,

01:53.747 --> 01:55.909
guitar twangings,
piano tinklings.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.141
Don't worry.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.378
Al, I can make
these drum skins sing.

01:59.519 --> 02:00.884
Okay, look, look.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.284
You pay me a buck for the snare,

02:02.422 --> 02:04.914
-50 cents for the cymbals...
- Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.924
People want to hear
the jukebox.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.619
The jukebox?

02:08.762 --> 02:11.959
Al, people want live music,
personality.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.363
You gotta try new ideas,
you know what I mean?

02:14.501 --> 02:16.230
Look, Al, I bet
you're the type of guy

02:16.370 --> 02:18.498
that would've told
Elvis Presley not to wiggle.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.971
Well, how's it going,
Lori Beth?

02:21.108 --> 02:23.839
I have the notes organized,
a schedule for studying

02:23.977 --> 02:26.912
and planned rest breaks
to make out.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.374
She really shines during finals.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.509
All right, I've got the maps
for the history test.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.453
Malph, we don't need a map
to find the classroom.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.455
I'll help Potsie
with the anatomy exam.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.688
Couldn't we just go to
Inspiration Point, instead?

02:42.829 --> 02:45.264
Potsie, now, how do you expect
to learn anatomy

02:45.399 --> 02:47.424
at Inspiration Point?

02:50.370 --> 02:53.431
They're so young.

02:53.573 --> 02:54.802
Come on, Potsie,
we've got to hurry.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.171
Oh, hey, Jenny, what's the use?

02:57.310 --> 02:58.800
I'm going to flunk anatomy
anyway.

02:58.945 --> 03:00.470
Listen, it's a required course.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.015
You have to pass if you want
to be a psychologist.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.584
Yeah, well, I've been thinking
about that psychology stuff

03:04.718 --> 03:07.653
and maybe it's just
a crazy idea, huh?

03:11.224 --> 03:13.488
<i>HOWARD: Why is it
the Chinese restaurants</i>

03:13.627 --> 03:16.062
<i>always put soup
on the bottom of the bag?</i>

03:16.196 --> 03:17.857
Joanie, would you get
your father a napkin?

03:17.998 --> 03:19.591
Sure, Mom.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.293
He has sparerib juice
on his hands.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.928
Oh, yes.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.063
I'm home.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.739
Joanie, I heard report cards
came out today.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.209
Well, how'd you do?

03:33.346 --> 03:36.077
Well, I got an "A" and a "B"
and three "C"s.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.342
You got an "A"?

03:37.484 --> 03:38.952
- Gym.
- Ah.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.384
Well, when are you gonna tell
Mom and Dad?

03:41.521 --> 03:42.920
Well, I figure a good time
would be

03:43.056 --> 03:45.923
somewhere between the fried rice
and my wedding reception.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.288
Yeah.

03:47.427 --> 03:48.485
I'll try and help.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.357
I don't want you to get grounded
or anything.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.488
Thanks. I'm going to need
your help, big brother.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.623
There's a big dance coming up
this Saturday night.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.532
- I'll do what I can.
- Okay.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.331
Dinner is served.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.667
- Yeah, it looks good.
- Sit down.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.103
Here, Dad.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.936
You can have my spareribs.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.669
I'm not that hungry.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.973
You're not hungry for spareribs?

04:07.114 --> 04:09.139
Joanie, are you sure you're
feeling all right, dear?

04:09.282 --> 04:10.545
Mom, I'm fine.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.449
The girl knows
her own mind, Marion.

04:13.587 --> 04:17.046
Well, uh, actually,

04:17.190 --> 04:18.817
- I have an announcement
to make. -Hmm?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.950
Report cards came out today.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.562
How did you do, dear?

04:22.696 --> 04:25.165
- I got an
- That's great, Joanie.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.596
(laughs):
Yeah. Thanks.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.463
Oh. Yeah.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.037
Isn't that great, Dad?

04:31.171 --> 04:33.765
I don't want to hear
what she got in gym.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.467
All right, young lady,
about those grades.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.978
(doorbell rings)

04:40.113 --> 04:41.103
HOWARD: Come in.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.239
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.283
All right, all right.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.944
Am I ready
to study tonight, Mrs. C.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.852
Get out the midnight oil.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.458
It's gonna be an all-nighter.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.355
Ooh, you're having Chinese food.

04:53.493 --> 04:58.431
Confucius say, "Man who study
anatomy needs sparerib."

05:00.433 --> 05:03.459
Howard Cunningham say,
"Bug off."

05:04.871 --> 05:05.838
Good saying.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.462
Yeah, well, let's study
upstairs, okay?

05:07.607 --> 05:08.972
- Yeah. -Yeah, this is going
to be a hard test.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.338
Yeah. Where's Potsie?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.410
Oh, well, he said
he'd be here, right?

05:11.545 --> 05:12.740
- Right.
- Yeah, he'll be here.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.711
Don't worry about Potsie.
He'll be fine.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.043
Can I sit down and have a...

05:16.183 --> 05:17.981
- Go study. -Go study.
- Go study.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.155
Now, young lady,
about that report card.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.452
(doorbell rings)

05:25.592 --> 05:26.650
Come in.

05:26.793 --> 05:30.354
- Hi, Potsie.
- Hi, Potsie.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.090
Hi, everybody.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.633
Warren, would you like something
to eat?

05:34.768 --> 05:36.065
Uh, no, thanks, Mrs. C.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.602
I'm really too depressed to eat.

05:37.737 --> 05:40.707
Maybe one sparerib.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.071
Well, listen now,
you go upstairs.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.575
The kids are studying
and they'll help you.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.008
Aw, thanks a lot.

05:46.146 --> 05:49.172
- Uh...
- Oh, here, here, put it here.

05:49.316 --> 05:52.308
Oh, thanks, Mr. C.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.652
Poor Warren.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.689
Poor Daddy.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.293
Now, young lady, about that...

06:04.698 --> 06:06.564
Good, nobody's there.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.225
Now, about that report card.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.496
Hold it, everybody!

06:12.005 --> 06:13.734
Whoa.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.373
The brakes on my bike broke.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.877
I had to stop
with my bare feet.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.414
Ooh.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.780
Looks like you're gonna need
another pair of boots, Fonz.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.479
You're very observant,
Shortcake.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.990
Oh, Arthur, don't you have
an extra pair of boots?

06:32.125 --> 06:33.320
Yeah, I've got an extra
pair of boots.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.655
I lent them to
the Hooper triplets

06:34.794 --> 06:36.455
and they, er, uh--
they like leather...

06:36.596 --> 06:37.893
It's a long story.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.794
I gotta go, Shortcake.
You're cute.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.335
Well, first thing
in the morning,

06:44.471 --> 06:46.997
I'm going to call this man who
sells the best boots in town.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.232
FONZIE: What's his name?

06:48.375 --> 06:49.604
Mr. Rudi.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.904
I think I'm in trouble.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.139
(Snaps fingers)

06:55.282 --> 06:57.774
Now about that report card.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.977
You know, Emily Snodgrass
got two "F"s and...

07:00.120 --> 07:02.418
I don't care what
Emily Snodgrass got.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.649
I only care about my daughter.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.283
Now, it's not easy to get into
a good college these days

07:07.427 --> 07:08.724
and "C"s won't do it.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.456
Well, she's trying, dear.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.430
I really am trying, Dad.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.000
Well, you're going to have
to try harder.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.603
Well, maybe I don't want
to go to college.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.670
You know, it's my own life.

07:18.805 --> 07:20.239
Well, you'd better change
your attitude, young lady,

07:20.373 --> 07:23.741
or your life is going to stay
home for the weekend.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.973
(indistinct conversations)

07:32.852 --> 07:34.843
(playing harmonica)

07:37.057 --> 07:39.685
Hmm, will you look
at that Bunny Martel?

07:39.826 --> 07:41.555
Mmm-mm!

07:41.695 --> 07:44.323
I'd sell my grandmother
to the Huns to go out with her.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.699
Ralph, you are all talk
and no action.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.360
Go over there and ask her out.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.335
I mean, what's the worst thing
a girl can do to you?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.032
Well, so far, the worst
was a compound fracture.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.143
Just do it, will you?

07:57.277 --> 07:58.540
(plays a few notes)

07:58.678 --> 07:59.668
Well, how's my hair look?

07:59.813 --> 08:00.905
Fine, fine.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.243
For the kind of hair you got.

08:03.383 --> 08:04.578
I'm kidding!

08:04.718 --> 08:06.447
I'm just kidding, go over
and ask her. Go ahead.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.946
Hi, there.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.717
Nice sweater.
Want to go to a movie?

08:11.858 --> 08:13.417
No, thank you.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.153
Want to go to dinner?

08:15.295 --> 08:16.490
No, thank you.

08:16.629 --> 08:17.892
Want to go bowling?

08:18.031 --> 08:19.692
No, thank you.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.460
It was nice talking to you.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.905
- How'd it go?
- It's working.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.007
I'll tell you about it later.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.006
Hey, girls.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.610
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Ralph.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.234
You ladies read the assignment?

08:32.379 --> 08:33.778
Three times.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.143
No way Professor Thomas
is going to stump me.

08:36.282 --> 08:37.147
Me, neither.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.375
That man scares me to death.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.610
(laughs)
You hear that, Rich?

08:39.753 --> 08:40.948
The Professor scares them.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.282
(laughs)

08:42.422 --> 08:43.719
Girls, girls...

08:43.857 --> 08:45.347
Sit, Malph.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.551
Yes, sir.
Sitting, sir.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.184
Yes, sir, sir, sir.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.263
Straighten your chair.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.196
Where's Potsie?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.403
RICHIE (whispering):
Look, there's Potsie.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.530
(students whispering)

09:05.045 --> 09:05.910
(screams)

09:06.046 --> 09:07.775
Malph...

09:07.914 --> 09:09.905
It wasn't me!

09:10.050 --> 09:13.577
- Ah, Weber, of course.
- Yes, sir.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.654
Late and noisy.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.314
Well, I'm sorry.
I overslept.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.856
I was studying all night long.

09:18.992 --> 09:19.857
Hmm.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.461
We'll see about that later.

09:21.594 --> 09:24.325
Right now, you're wasting
the class's time.

09:24.464 --> 09:25.454
Sit!

09:27.901 --> 09:30.393
The right ventricle

09:30.537 --> 09:33.507
is stationed just below where?

09:33.640 --> 09:34.505
Cunningham?

09:34.641 --> 09:35.802
Cunningham!

09:35.942 --> 09:36.932
'What?!
"Ah!

09:38.511 --> 09:40.138
Oh, uh... wh-what, sir?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.078
Where is the right ventricle?

09:42.215 --> 09:44.081
Uh, it is positioned, uh,

09:44.217 --> 09:45.582
directly beneath
the right auricle.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.777
(talking over each other)

09:47.921 --> 09:49.980
You merely answered
the question correctly.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.648
You didn't win a Nobel Prize.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.657
RALPH (laughing):
Nobel Prize...

09:53.793 --> 09:54.658
THOMAS:
Malph.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.057
No Nobel Prize, sir.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.062
Weber?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.165
Yes, sir?

10:01.301 --> 10:03.827
Where is the aorta situated?

10:03.970 --> 10:05.301
Uh...

10:05.438 --> 10:06.963
THOMAS:
You don't know, do you?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.097
I'm thinking.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.034
You don't know, do you?!

10:11.177 --> 10:12.406
- I do, I studied it, I know it.
- Uh-huh.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.172
- What is a ventricle?
- Ventricle is a...

10:14.314 --> 10:16.112
- What is a capillary?
- Washington.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.479
(Sputters)

10:18.618 --> 10:20.985
You don't belong
in this classroom, Weber!

10:21.121 --> 10:23.419
You are a rotten apple

10:23.556 --> 10:25.217
affecting the whole bunch.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.384
Oh, it's going to give me
great pleasure

10:28.528 --> 10:31.498
to give you a big, fat zero

10:31.631 --> 10:33.497
on your examination tomorrow.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.931
(students exclaiming)

10:36.069 --> 10:38.060
Hey... hey, you wait a minute.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.729
I'm tired of getting picked on.

10:39.873 --> 10:40.863
And you know something else?

10:41.007 --> 10:42.304
You're a rotten teacher.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.309
Potsie, sit down.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.707
Just forget it, Rich.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.210
I don't have to take this
from him or anybody else.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.473
You're going to get
kicked out of this class.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.585
No, I'm not going
to get kicked out,

10:51.718 --> 10:53.186
'cause I'm going to quit school.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.411
Yeah.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.544
That's what I'm gonna do.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.588
I quit school!

11:11.838 --> 11:12.862
Hi, hi, hi.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.269
- Hey, Al.
- Hi, Al. -Hi, All.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.966
Did Potsie go back
to school yet?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.634
No. We've all talked to him.

11:17.777 --> 11:18.869
He won't change his mind.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.036
He's really making
a big mistake,

11:20.180 --> 11:21.045
don't you think, Al?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.876
Oh, poor Potsie.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.950
It's a cruel world out there

11:25.084 --> 11:27.519
and he's not ready for it.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.780
Yeah.

11:28.922 --> 11:32.051
ALL: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.355
That's right. Yeah, yeah...

11:35.495 --> 11:37.190
All right, all right.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.162
Let's get back to studying.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.599
(whistles)

11:42.735 --> 11:44.999
Hey, Richie. Come here.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.299
Walk me to my office.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.999
All right. Uh...

11:49.142 --> 11:51.167
What can I do for you, Fonz?

11:51.311 --> 11:54.178
Walk me to my office
and stick close.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.475
Sure.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.546
Fonz...

12:06.359 --> 12:07.383
Fonz, you're...

12:07.527 --> 12:09.461
wearing paper sacks
on your feet.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.587
That's right, I'm wearing
paper sacks on my feet!

12:11.731 --> 12:13.028
Anybody want to say
anything about it?

12:13.166 --> 12:14.725
No, Fonz, they look real good.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.130
That's right,
they look real good.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.862
As a matter of fact,

12:18.004 --> 12:20.200
you could do yourself
a favor and get a pair.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.241
Hey, Rich, do me a favor.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.146
If a, uh, a man comes in here,
Mr. Rudi, you know,

12:31.284 --> 12:33.048
tell him I'm in my office.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.415
Yeah, sure, Fonz.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.147
Oh, Fonz, I-l almost forgot
to tell you something.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.415
Have you heard about Potsie?

12:37.557 --> 12:38.581
No, I haven't heard
about Potsie.

12:38.725 --> 12:39.590
He quit school.

12:39.726 --> 12:40.921
You want me to hit him?

12:41.060 --> 12:42.289
Well, no, Fonz,

12:42.428 --> 12:43.486
but you know,
he respects you so much...

12:43.630 --> 12:44.620
- Yeah.
-...l thought maybe if you just

12:44.764 --> 12:45.629
talked to him for
a few minutes...

12:45.765 --> 12:46.823
Come on, Potsie.

12:46.966 --> 12:47.956
Nothing's going to help, Chach.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.193
- Why?
- Come on, Chach...

12:49.335 --> 12:51.394
I found him at
the unemployment office.

12:51.537 --> 12:54.507
Potsie, you cannot
collect unemployment.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.905
Why not? I'm unemployed.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.102
Potsie... in my office,
conference time.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.644
- Fonz, it's not gonna help...
- No backtalk.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.111
- Get in there.
- Conference time, come on, Pots.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.114
It's good for you.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.544
Oh, uh, are you Mr. Fonzarelli?

13:07.687 --> 13:09.052
Yes.

13:09.188 --> 13:10.053
"Heyyv---"

13:10.189 --> 13:11.418
I wish I was.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.990
That's him over there with
the paper bags on his feet.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.358
Oh. (chuckles)

13:17.497 --> 13:18.965
Ah, Mr. Fonzarelli.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.725
I am Mr. Rudi...

13:20.867 --> 13:23.393
"Boots for Every Occasion."

13:25.071 --> 13:26.402
I came just in time.

13:29.175 --> 13:32.372
All right.
You talk... you boot.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.179
Fonz, I'm gonna flunk anatomy.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.373
What's the problem?

13:36.516 --> 13:37.540
I've got this mental block...

13:37.684 --> 13:39.049
Yeah, I know that.
What's the problem?

13:39.185 --> 13:41.654
<i>Trés chic.</i>

13:47.593 --> 13:49.288
You see a horse out there?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.132
I heard "whoa.".

13:54.467 --> 13:57.129
Here, here...
let's take them off.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.698
I like a boot man
with a sense of humor.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.138
(Rudi chuckles)

14:03.276 --> 14:05.404
All right, now look, what do
you got to know about anatomy?

14:05.545 --> 14:06.740
The heart's on the left side.

14:06.879 --> 14:10.247
Look, Fonz, you know,
I do great in school,

14:10.383 --> 14:12.249
but this professor hates me.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.513
So before he could flunk me,
I quit.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.712
Okay, that's ridiculous.

14:15.855 --> 14:16.981
Listen to this logic...

14:17.123 --> 14:18.420
one spark plug goes bad,

14:18.558 --> 14:19.753
you don't throw away
the whole car.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.156
But, Fonz,
it's these anatomy words.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.387
I can't remember them.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.429
Ventri... ventra... ventri...

14:25.565 --> 14:26.862
That's "ventricle."

14:26.999 --> 14:28.091
See, he knows it.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.099
He knows it.

14:29.235 --> 14:30.168
It's that professor.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.328
He drives me nuts.
He intimidates me.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.399
I've got it.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.000
These boots are you.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.136
<i>II</i>

14:53.960 --> 14:54.893
Now look, Potsie,

14:55.027 --> 14:57.155
you do very well
in school, right?

14:57.296 --> 14:58.422
Yeah.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.396
So why can't you learn
this stuff, anatomy?

15:00.533 --> 15:01.728
Look, I don't care
about learning it.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.563
Fonz, all I want
is a decent grade.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.000
See, there's your problem,
Potsie.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.470
Grades are not cool,
learning is cool.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.133
Now you got to relate to it,
you got to relate to it.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.766
What is the easiest thing
for you to remember?

15:11.911 --> 15:12.776
I forget.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.074
I'm going to tell you... music!

15:15.214 --> 15:16.511
Yeah, sure. I remember songs.

15:16.649 --> 15:17.946
What good's that going to do me?

15:18.084 --> 15:21.782
Warren, you're going to sing
your way through science.

15:21.921 --> 15:22.911
Whoa.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.281
I think I'll take these.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.489
- You'll take these?
- You'll take these?

15:29.629 --> 15:31.859
Yeah. I can use them
for my bike reflectors.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.696
I write small.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.771
How about a little kiss
for luck, Sizzle Lips?

15:47.914 --> 15:49.404
Better just shake hands.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.745
I gotta keep my...
my mind clear for this exam.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.415
Fonz, Fonz,
I don't feel so good.

15:55.555 --> 15:56.420
My stomach's in knots.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.854
I got you covered. Here.

15:58.991 --> 16:00.686
Two Fig Newtons.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.387
One for now, one for later.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.523
Hey, thanks, Fonz.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.296
Hey, Prof, take it easy
on these kids.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.564
I mean, they're our future.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.372
Cunningham,
would you be so kind?

16:23.516 --> 16:24.415
Oh. Yes, sir.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.541
Pass these out.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.086
Today's test

16:31.224 --> 16:34.216
will be on the heart

16:34.360 --> 16:35.885
and the circulatory system.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.518
Oh.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.291
Anyone who does not
know the difference

16:40.433 --> 16:42.333
between an artery and a vein

16:42.468 --> 16:43.697
may as well leave now.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.737
Sit, Malph.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.639
You have exactly 55 minutes.

16:51.777 --> 16:52.972
(Ralph wails)

16:53.112 --> 16:54.739
Begin.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.212
(blows pitch pipe)

17:03.356 --> 17:05.757
(humming very quietly)

17:08.493 --> 17:10.986
<i>II</i>

17:41.360 --> 17:42.987
(timer rings)

17:43.129 --> 17:45.257
(screams)

17:45.398 --> 17:46.991
Pencils down, please.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.567
Pass your papers forward.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.603
LORI BETH:
Come on, Rich...

17:52.738 --> 17:53.603
RICHIE:
I got it, I...

17:53.739 --> 17:55.366
- Ah!
-(Richie grunts)

17:55.508 --> 17:57.909
Ralph, how do you think
Potsie did?

17:58.044 --> 17:59.239
I don't know about him,

17:59.378 --> 18:01.745
but I had trouble
with the sample question.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.607
- Mr. Weber.
- Yes, sir?

18:05.751 --> 18:08.220
I noticed you finished
quite early.

18:08.354 --> 18:09.913
Oh, thanks, sir.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.081
Did you find the test so easy?

18:12.224 --> 18:13.851
Oh, yes, sir.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.757
No, sir, no,
not easy, sir... uh-uh.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.294
- Here, Professor.
- Here, Professor.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.661
Uh, anything else?
Wash the blackboard?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.199
Maybe I could clear
your desk off for you.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.326
Sit, girls.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.328
Ah-ha!

18:28.274 --> 18:32.142
I have here Mr. Weber's paper.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.645
CLASS:
Uh-oh.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.714
I'm sure you all remember

18:36.849 --> 18:40.149
that someone called me
a terrible teacher.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.481
It was "rotten teacher."

18:41.621 --> 18:43.612
CLASS:
Shh...

18:44.757 --> 18:47.624
Maybe... maybe it was
"terrible."

18:47.760 --> 18:52.493
Well, rather than, uh,
me calling names,

18:52.632 --> 18:55.363
why don't we let
Mr. Weber's paper

18:55.501 --> 18:57.435
speak for itself?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.538
(students murmuring)

19:02.475 --> 19:04.239
Well...

19:04.377 --> 19:06.175
he answered
the first one correct.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.939
(students cheering, shrieking)

19:08.080 --> 19:10.071
Beginner's luck.

19:12.118 --> 19:15.144
Something is wrong here,
Mr. Weber.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.857
You've answered...

19:20.993 --> 19:23.155
all of the questions correct.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.285
Hooray!

19:24.430 --> 19:25.693
(students cheering)

19:25.831 --> 19:27.663
<i>I</i> got 10o!

19:27.800 --> 19:30.235
You got a zero!

19:30.369 --> 19:31.302
- What?
- A zero?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.269
Why would you give him a zero?

19:33.406 --> 19:35.465
You just told him
he got all the answers right.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.474
He cheated.
He must've cheated!

19:37.610 --> 19:39.442
I didn't cheat.
I studied all night.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.569
I really studied hard.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.873
My boy don't cheat.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.587
Who are you?

19:48.721 --> 19:49.779
Weber's trainer.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.219
Really?

19:51.357 --> 19:52.222
Really.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.723
He cheated.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.386
He's a disgrace
to this entire university.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.589
Listen, I didn't cheat.
I really st...

19:59.732 --> 20:03.191
My boy is not
a disgrace anywhere.

20:03.335 --> 20:06.100
I'll tell you
who's a disgrace, bucko.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.503
I just got to warn you,

20:12.645 --> 20:16.047
when he starts off with "bucko,"

20:16.182 --> 20:18.276
you're in trouble.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.987
Potsie Weber knows this material

20:23.122 --> 20:24.556
better than anybody
in this class.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.215
And he didn't learn it from you

20:26.358 --> 20:28.122
or your intimidating methods.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.058
He learned it from
something he could relate to.

20:30.196 --> 20:31.960
Weber can relate to something?

20:32.098 --> 20:33.862
- Now, just a minute! I don't...
- Yeah, that's right.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.524
He relates to music and lyrics.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.533
- Yeah.
-(Thomas laughs)

20:36.669 --> 20:38.194
Charming.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.236
But impossible.

20:39.371 --> 20:40.236
(talking over each other)

20:40.372 --> 20:41.271
FONZIE:
All right, hold it, hold it!

20:41.407 --> 20:43.933
Like they say in Home Ec. 101,

20:44.076 --> 20:45.635
the proof is in the pudding.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.974
- Yeah, let us show you
some pudding. -Come on.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.275
Right. Let him show you.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.042
Why don't you give him a chance?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.049
Go ahead.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.915
All right, now,
like we rehearsed it.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.420
- Malph, get the bones.
- Got it.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.115
All right, Rich,
you got your harmonica there.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.589
Hey, Jennifer, beaker, right?

21:00.726 --> 21:02.091
Got your kazoo there.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.423

Yeah.

Potsie got an "A"
on the anatomy exam.

- Oh, that's terrific.
- An "A,"-- oh, that's wonderful!

23:24.670 --> 23:25.637
Yeah. I passed.

23:25.771 --> 23:26.795
I knew you would.

Mom...

23:33.412 --> 23:34.937
Oh, Dad, I was thinking.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.377
About Joanie's dance...

23:36.515 --> 23:38.040
I mean, don't you think
you're being just a little bit

23:38.183 --> 23:39.708
hard on her, not letting
her go and everything?

23:39.852 --> 23:42.287
He's only doing it because
he loves her very much

23:42.421 --> 23:43.820
and he cares about her future.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.515
Now, look,
I have made up my mind

no more arguments.

you've been trying hard

24:07.846 --> 24:09.371
and keeping you home
Saturday night

24:09.515 --> 24:11.074
isn't going to help
your grades any.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.150
Well, I guess
I won't need these.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.650
I found them in the attic.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.553
Oh, these are your father's
