Yes!

00:19.586 --> 00:22.489
Alright. Hi, coaches.
Hi, Ariana Grande.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.091
Hello, Carson.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.360
I want to know if you have
a strategy in mind.

00:26.393 --> 00:28.328
I don't necessarily
have a strategy,

00:28.362 --> 00:31.365
I just am emotionally
very distraught

00:31.398 --> 00:32.733
'cause I love my team
so much.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.201
Follow your gut,
follow your heart.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.702
Or I can just, you know,
run home.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.371
No, you can't do that.
We need you.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.106
I literally
just leave.

00:39.139 --> 00:41.208
You can buy other people's
steals from them, too.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.110
Blake, no, you cannot.
Your best strategy

00:43.143 --> 00:45.345
is to not listen to Blake.
Amen.

00:45.379 --> 00:49.349
Blake, are you threatened by
any one of them in particular?

00:52.719 --> 00:54.488
No.
Thank you, Blake.

00:54.521 --> 00:56.223
Yeah.
Kelly, we know your least
favorite part of the battles

00:56.256 --> 00:57.624
is saying goodbye
to half your team.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.027
This is my best team
overall of any season...
Right.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.229
...so it doesn't really
get easier.

01:04.398 --> 01:07.134
Why are you clappingfor her?

01:07.167 --> 01:08.402
That's what happens
when people like you.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.037
I know you don't know
the sound.

01:11.371 --> 01:13.106
Ouch.
Alright, let's do it.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.509
Thank you, coaches.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.411
Yeah!

01:18.712 --> 01:20.180
This is great.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.415
We're so lucky
to have you here, Camila.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.383
Oh, thank you for having me.
It's an honor.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.185
Sounds like
a female's voice.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.753
I can't tell who it is.
I know.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.455
Is it okay if I always say,

01:28.488 --> 01:30.390
"That's some legendary
behavior"?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.226
I think
the use of this pun...

01:32.259 --> 01:34.061
It's great.
...has been approved.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.129
Like, I feel like even if
they all get T‐shirts ‐‐

01:36.163 --> 01:38.165
"Legendary behavior."
Oh, I love it.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.666
I'm gonna hire you
for marketing, too.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.368
Hey.
Let's go.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.537
Ready? I didn't think I was,
like, gonna be nervous.
Yeah.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.772
But now that it's here,
I am a little bit nervous,

01:45.806 --> 01:47.541
I got to say.
Feels very real.

01:47.574 --> 01:50.444
Alright. So now we've got
Keilah and Joshua.

Seeing Camila Cabello
was a total shock.

I was shook.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.530
So nice to meet you.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.033
To have these two powerhouses
in the industry

02:46.066 --> 02:47.568
helping us is amazing.

02:47.601 --> 02:51.004
And having a mentor
that is in that pop world

02:51.038 --> 02:55.008
but also is able to be
super individual is really cool

02:55.042 --> 02:56.577
'cause that's what
I'm aiming to be.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.512
She's experienced so much
in our business...
Yeah.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.447
...from being
on a competition show,

03:00.480 --> 03:03.116
being in a group
where harmony is important...
Yeah.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.153
...and then being a really
successful solo artist as well.
Yeah.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.422
It's really inspiring
that she started

03:08.455 --> 03:10.190
when she was my age
on a singing show.

03:10.224 --> 03:14.194
Now she's this name and she's
on the charts all the time.

03:14.228 --> 03:17.264
That's, like, one of
my biggest dreams.

03:17.297 --> 03:19.766
I've been singing basically
all of my life.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.335

03:21.368 --> 03:24.338
We're kind of like a modern‐day
Partridge Family.

03:24.371 --> 03:28.442
When I was 12, I started
gigging a lot in New York City

03:28.475 --> 03:32.412
and I got to sing my song
"Somehow" at iHeartRadio.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.181
The tagline is,
"You'll get there somehow,"

03:34.214 --> 03:36.350
like chasing your dream
and not letting go.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.684

03:37.718 --> 03:40.554

did a great job.

I'm gonna have to say,
'cause I even turned for Keilah,

but, Joshua,
you surprised me.

And honestly, it was
when you said "emotional."

I don't know what the hell
you did,

"Okay, Joshua."

It was so good.
Thank you, Kelly.

I'm not sure what just happened
on the stage,

12:05.392 --> 12:08.028
but I feel like
it happened so quickly,

12:08.061 --> 12:09.596
I'm gonna have to
watch this on TV

12:09.630 --> 12:11.098
and, like,
put it in slow motion

12:11.131 --> 12:12.666

it al

12:12.699 --> 12:14.635
I told you guys, you're gonna
blow Blake's mind.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.703
He would not know
what to do.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.173
You fried it.
You fried my brain.

I gotta say, Joshua,
what the hell, dude?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.244
I mean, that was crazy.

12:24.278 --> 12:27.114
You both sounded great, but from
a performance standpoint,

12:27.147 --> 12:29.483
I don't know that I've ever
seen anything like that.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.485
I would have to
pick Joshua.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.220
Thank you, Blake.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.658
That was so exciting
and entertaining and infectious.

12:37.691 --> 12:39.660
Something simpatico
is happening here.

12:39.693 --> 12:42.229
But, Joshua,
you know I love you.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.665
I'm obsessed with you.
I have been from the beginning.

12:44.698 --> 12:47.100
I loved what you brought
to this song.

12:47.134 --> 12:52.105
But, Keilah, between your range
and your control for your age

12:52.139 --> 12:55.075
and your energy,
I couldn't stop watching you.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.010
And I
know I'm like
the odd man out,

12:57.044 --> 12:59.012
but I would lean towards you
in this case.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.681
I loved that performance,
though, and you're both ‐‐

John, you got
the final decision.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.524
Give us some thoughts before you
tell us who won the battle.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.292
You all knocked it
out of the park.

13:12.326 --> 13:16.296
It was so energetic, so fun,
and as I predicted,

13:16.330 --> 13:18.532
you blew Blake's mind.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.667
Fried my brain.

13:20.701 --> 13:24.638
Joshua, what I loved
about your performance

13:24.671 --> 13:26.373
was the additional little sauce

13:26.406 --> 13:28.342
that you put on
some of those notes ‐‐

13:28.375 --> 13:29.610

13:29.643 --> 13:30.744
when you sing that
in that first verse

13:32.779 --> 13:34.515
People are like,
"What's he gonna do next?

13:34.548 --> 13:36.450
- This is exciting.
- Th is is fu

13:36.483 --> 13:38.085

13:40.521 --> 13:42.155
what you were supposed to do
in this moment.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.726
And for you to be 15
and tackle something

13:45.759 --> 13:48.562
as emotionally angsty
as this song

13:48.595 --> 13:50.564
and do it so well
was so impressive.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.432
I loved it.
You're so good.

to be your coach.

Thank you, John.

think right now.

My brain's, like,
going in a million places.

Coaches, let me remind you
Keilah's available to steal.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.078
Keilah, anything you'd like
to say to your coach?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.546
I just want to say
thank you so much

14:39.580 --> 14:41.348
for giving me
a chance on this show.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.749

I've already grown

just being in your presence.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.166
Keilah is
a really good singer.

14:59.199 --> 15:03.136
I just think right now
Joshua has more character,

15:03.170 --> 15:05.506
more individuality,
more ability to kind of

15:05.539 --> 15:08.041
break through all the noise
and all the clutter

for not stealing her.

I should have stolen her.

I thought you might.
I thought you might,
actually.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.357
part of you that's doing
the soft Vince Gill thing,

21:30.390 --> 21:32.259
but then there's a singer
that you turn into

21:32.292 --> 21:34.561
that's kind of got, like,
a really pointed tone

21:34.595 --> 21:35.662
that cuts through.

21:35.696 --> 21:37.431
When you sing from here,

21:37.464 --> 21:39.299
there's a bigger tone there.

to live in that land

26:31.391 --> 26:34.628
Your tone was really good.
Your notes were really good.

26:34.661 --> 26:36.230
You were the shocker
for me.

26:36.263 --> 26:37.497
Thank you so much.

26:37.531 --> 26:39.466
Thank you, coaches.

26:39.499 --> 26:41.668
Alright, Blake, you got
a tough decision here, buddy.

26:41.702 --> 26:43.270
Give us some thoughts
on the battle.

26:43.303 --> 26:45.739
People don't normally cover
Vince Gill songs.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.242
You know, that's kind of
one that you avoid.

26:48.275 --> 26:51.211
Thank yo
u guys f
or working so hard on this thing.

26:51.245 --> 26:55.015
Clint has a soulful R&B‐type
sound to his voice

26:55.048 --> 26:56.383
that he blends
with country music,

26:56.416 --> 26:58.785
you know, with his vibrato
and stuff,

26:58.819 --> 27:00.554
and it's just really warm
and sounds cool.
Maybe that's why
he stood out in this, though,

27:00.587 --> 27:02.022
'cause Vince has that.

27:02.055 --> 27:04.291
Vince also has the bluegrass
stuff, you know.

27:04.324 --> 27:05.792
Carson,
it kind of brought out

27:05.826 --> 27:08.095
more of a rock edge
that I didn't expect.

27:08.128 --> 27:09.329
I figured it'd be more

27:09.363 --> 27:11.098
down‐the‐middle sound
like Vince Gill

27:11.131 --> 27:13.200
and found out that a whole
other different sound

27:13.233 --> 27:16.270
that Carson has that
he implemented into the song.

27:16.303 --> 27:18.172
I saw two totally
different things

27:18.205 --> 27:20.207
than I thought I would,
and I love both of them.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.243
You guys stepped up to the plate
and did it, so thank you.

27:23.277 --> 27:24.645
Great job.

27:24.678 --> 27:26.513
This is a tough one here
for you, Blake.

27:26.547 --> 27:28.415
Who is the winner
of this battle?

27:35.589 --> 27:39.193
Winner of this battle...

27:39.226 --> 27:40.327
is Carson.

27:40.360 --> 27:43.263
Carson Peters moving on
to the knockouts.

27:43.297 --> 27:44.531
Congratulations.

27:44.565 --> 27:46.733
I just feel like
Carson had the edge.

27:46.767 --> 27:48.769
He's just got
a few different gears

27:48.802 --> 27:50.671
he can go to as a vocalist.

27:50.704 --> 27:52.406
Carson's only 17 years old,

27:52.439 --> 27:54.408
and as a coach,
that's very exciting.

27:54.441 --> 27:57.411
Also, we haven't yet heard him
play fiddle.

27:57.444 --> 27:59.012
I can't wait for that.

27:59.046 --> 28:01.548
Give it up for
Clint Sherman, everybody!

28:03.183 --> 28:04.685
I love the battles because
you get to see

28:04.718 --> 28:06.687
the competitive nature
of people.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.422
So I'm looking for
an amazing voice

28:08.455 --> 28:10.190
but also a voice with character

28:10.224 --> 28:12.459
and someone that
I really connect with.

"Ooh, I just want to see

28:33.180 --> 28:34.615

and I thought both of you

28:34.648 --> 28:36.149
would lend very well to, like,

28:36.183 --> 28:38.352

28:54.067 --> 28:56.270
Honestly, I ended up
going with Holly

28:56.303 --> 28:59.473
just because there was something
so magical about her tone

28:59.506 --> 29:02.342

35:15.215 --> 35:16.783
I love listening to
Hispanic songs,

35:16.817 --> 35:19.186
like Selena and Ozuna.

35:19.219 --> 35:21.388
My dad ‐‐ he'll want me
to sing Selena,

35:21.421 --> 35:24.358
and I'll do that for him
and, you know, I'll perform,

35:24.391 --> 35:27.528
but I don't really go out
and do, like, big performances.

35:27.561 --> 35:31.532
But I do gig for my teddy bears
in my room, if that counts.

35:32.666 --> 35:33.800
This is what it's about.

35:33.834 --> 35:35.102
Yes.
Right here.

35:35.135 --> 35:36.703
She teaches me
all the time.

35:36.737 --> 35:38.338
Shut up. I ‐‐ Sorry.

35:38.372 --> 35:40.374
I've learned everything ever
from watching this woman.

35:40.407 --> 35:42.676
So sorry, no.
You know what I learned
the most

35:42.709 --> 35:44.678
about riffing?
Mean something.

35:44.711 --> 35:46.380
When we were doing
"Hairspray Live,"

35:46.413 --> 35:48.682
you would pitch a joke or,
like, a melody change

35:48.715 --> 35:51.218
here and there and ask,
"Does this add value?"

35:51.251 --> 35:54.021
And as a performer, to me,
that changed my life entirely,

35:54.054 --> 35:56.690
'cause now when I am writing
songs or performing songs,

35:56.723 --> 35:58.292
if I'm gonna do a run,

35:58.325 --> 36:00.127
I want to make sure
that it adds value

36:00.160 --> 36:01.562
and that it has intention.

36:01.595 --> 36:03.030
That changed my entire life.
Thank you.

36:03.063 --> 36:04.131
I've never looked
at anything the same way.

36:04.164 --> 36:06.033
I swear to God.
Thank you.

36:06.066 --> 36:08.035
I'm eating my breakfast,
I'm like, "Does this add value?"

I'm like,

36:09.236 --> 36:11.371
"Does this body wash
add value?"

36:11.405 --> 36:12.573
I'm crying.

36:12.606 --> 36:14.708
I love you guys,
like, together.

36:14.741 --> 36:16.577

36:16.610 --> 36:18.212
that Kristin and Ariana had.

36:18.245 --> 36:20.214
Team Ari and Kristin.
That's right.

36:20.247 --> 36:21.348
That's my new team name.

36:21.381 --> 36:23.217
It's a really beautiful
relationship that they have.

36:23.250 --> 36:25.219
You know, they're empowering
each other as women,

36:25.252 --> 36:26.353

you because you put on a show.

I love your tone.

40:53.353 --> 40:55.689
I love how there's, like,
this little scratch in it.

40:55.722 --> 40:57.291
It's very pop‐friendly,

40:57.324 --> 41:00.794
but it also has this little,
like, edge to it, too.

41:00.827 --> 41:03.163
You just have a level of polish

41:03.197 --> 41:05.199
and professionalism
in your voice.

Hi.

really good.

some development.

she's 13.

41:55.282 --> 41:57.684

that's interesting,

and you can help effect change.

I mean, she's ready right now.

42:04.091 --> 42:06.593
Like, you could say, "Okay,
we're going to lives tomorrow,

42:06.627 --> 42:08.195
pick ‐‐ pick a damn song,"

42:08.228 --> 42:10.330
and I guarantee you she will
and she'll be ready.

exciting, too.

the blind auditions,

to push yourself

outside of your comfort zone

42:30.717 --> 42:32.686
and grow so much.

I don't think you're a pop girl
in this way,

42:40.661 --> 42:42.629
but you have the soul to pull
it off, and you really did.

42:42.663 --> 42:44.598
That's why I wanted
to challenge you with it.

42:44.631 --> 42:47.267

45:33.767 --> 45:35.369
I can already hear everybody
making fun of me

45:35.402 --> 45:37.237
about putting two
four‐chair turns together,

This is Jason Aldean.

45:44.244 --> 45:46.613
I saw Jason Aldean.

45:46.647 --> 45:49.249
He's a Macon, Georgia, native.

45:49.283 --> 45:52.052
He's a writer, a producer,
knows how to move a crowd.

45:52.085 --> 45:55.689
I can't believe it. I'm working
with two superstars today.

45:58.525 --> 46:00.093
I haven't heard you all
since the blinds.

46:00.127 --> 46:03.297
So I literally did stalk
both of you online,

46:03.330 --> 46:06.500
and I didn't know you play,
like, several instruments.
Yeah.

46:06.533 --> 46:08.035
When I was about 7 or 8,

46:08.068 --> 46:12.039
I basically created
my own drum set with chopsticks.

keys, guitar, bass.

46:16.610 --> 46:19.379

for a real audience,

46:19.413 --> 46:22.115
I threw up twice backstage.

46:22.149 --> 46:25.219
Coming to "The Voice"
and getting a four‐chair turn

46:25.252 --> 46:27.221

an out‐of‐body experience.

I am ecstatic
to work with Kelly.

46:29.623 --> 46:31.758

that kind of made me curious

46:31.792 --> 46:33.327
to see
where you would take it.

46:33.360 --> 46:35.796
I gave them "Working"
by Tate McRae and Khalid.

46:35.829 --> 46:38.732
I love this song, and I thought
it was just a really cool vibe,

session called Groove Lounge,

54:24.531 --> 54:26.733
Thank you.
Thank you, coaches.

54:28.602 --> 54:30.337
Alright, Kelly,
you got the final decision.

54:30.370 --> 54:32.172
Give us some thoughts
on the battle first.

54:32.206 --> 54:33.707
I had so much fun.

54:33.740 --> 54:36.176
I think that that is the most
beautiful thing about music

54:36.210 --> 54:37.344
is that
when you
're so infecti ous

54:37.377 --> 54:38.612
and you're so captivating
as artists

54:38.645 --> 54:40.347
that everybody feels like
they're a part of it.

54:40.380 --> 54:42.216
Yeah.
And you both
elevate each other.

54:42.249 --> 54:45.519
Because, Gymani, you do have
this amazing, powerful voice.

54:45.552 --> 54:48.222
It's so stunning
and it's beautiful.
Thank you.

54:48.255 --> 54:51.592
And then, Aaron, I think
the sincerity, the intimacy,

54:51.625 --> 54:53.360
the level of artistry
you bring,

54:53.393 --> 54:55.362
it's a beautiful gift,
as well.

54:55.395 --> 54:57.097
I paired you both
because I thought

54:57.130 --> 54:58.765
it would sound incredible.

54:58.799 --> 55:01.201
Turns out I was right.

55:01.235 --> 55:03.136
I would love
both of your records.

55:03.170 --> 55:05.172
I would come to both
of your concerts.

55:05.205 --> 55:06.607
It sucks
because, you know, then I go,

55:06.640 --> 55:08.408
"I wish I wouldn't have put
y'all together," you know,

55:08.442 --> 55:10.310
because I don't want
to lose one of you.

55:10.344 --> 55:13.213
Kelly, who is the winner
of this battle?

55:13.247 --> 55:15.482
It hurts my heart.

55:19.586 --> 55:22.122
The winn
er of th
is battle is Gyman
i.

55:22.155 --> 55:23.290
Gymani, congratulations.

55:23.323 --> 55:24.658
You're moving on
to the knockouts

55:24.691 --> 55:26.793
representing Team Kelly.

55:26.827 --> 55:29.129
I went with Gymani 'cause
I think there's just something

55:29.162 --> 55:31.164
a little extra special
about her tone.

55:31.198 --> 55:32.699
She's kind of
a chameleon vocalist,

55:32.733 --> 55:34.234
so I'm pretty excited to see

55:34.268 --> 55:35.502
what she's gonna do
in the knockouts.

55:35.536 --> 55:37.738
Thank you!
Great job! Great job.

55:37.771 --> 55:39.239
I'm glad she picked me.

55:39.273 --> 55:42.142
I am super excited
to keep working with Kelly.

55:42.176 --> 55:43.577
And it's nothing but up.

55:43.610 --> 55:46.613
Coaches, let me remind you that
Aaron is available to steal.

55:46.647 --> 55:49.116
Aaron, anything you'd like
to say to Coach?

55:49.149 --> 55:50.250
You're amazing.

55:50.284 --> 55:51.785
The notes,
everything that you gave me

55:51.818 --> 55:54.388
is everything that I needed to
continue to grow as an artist.

ladies and gentlemen.

56:05.232 --> 56:06.700
I thought
you might have stolen him.

56:06.733 --> 56:08.035
He sounded amazing.

56:08.068 --> 56:10.037
It's my first battle rounds,

56:10.070 --> 56:13.440
and I'm looking for somebody
who is an amazing vocalist

56:13.473 --> 56:15.275
but also has
a clear point of view.

56:15.309 --> 56:17.477
Oh, man.
I'm waiting
for the right moment.

56:17.511 --> 56:19.413
I like his tone a lot.
I know he's, like,
really talented,

57:14.668 --> 57:16.570
Camila Cabello

but it was important
to represent my culture

57:54.174 --> 57:54.808
and to be different.

57:54.842 --> 57:56.476
Taking that risk was worth it

57:56.510 --> 57:58.745
because John turned his chair.

57:58.779 --> 58:01.381
Growing up
in a Brazilian community

and a Brazilian home,

We're super happy.

58:21.735 --> 58:23.170

So many people
starting out, like,

maybe don't have confidence

59:39.179 --> 59:40.747
in their falsetto

that that was a powerful part
of my voice.

from such iconic artists,
telling me, like,

1:00:08.208 --> 1:00:10.043

I have five siblings.
I'm number five out of six.

1:00:37.137 --> 1:00:39.106

1:00:39.139 --> 1:00:40.574
pretty much my whole childhood,

1:00:40.607 --> 1:00:43.043

to all the music he liked,

1:00:43.076 --> 1:00:45.612
which was Bob Dylan
and Johnny Cash and The Beatles,

1:00:45.646 --> 1:00:47.214
and it gave me this appreciation

1:00:47.247 --> 1:00:49.116
for the literary aspect
of music,

1:00:49.149 --> 1:00:51.418
things that you can relate with
on a deeper level.

it was
like,

1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:56.323
"Oh, wow, this is more
meaningful than I would expect."

1:00:56.356 --> 1:00:58.125
One of the lines
is, "When you're young,

1:00:58.158 --> 1:00:59.560
they assume you know nothing."

1:00:59.593 --> 1:01:02.162
So to have that kind of
mentality of, like, rising above

1:01:02.196 --> 1:01:04.064
like, "I can do more
than what you think

1:01:04.097 --> 1:01:05.532
an 18‐year‐old could do."

1:01:05.566 --> 1:01:08.368

because it's such
a personal, storyteller,

1:01:17.544 --> 1:01:19.112
singer/songwriter kind of song,

1:02:25.579 --> 1:02:27.447
and not over‐singing it,
you know?
Okay.

1:02:27.481 --> 1:02:29.550
I'm feeling way more
confident after the rehearsal.

1:02:29.583 --> 1:02:32.352
I'm gonna work on making it
more like a story,

1:02:32.386 --> 1:02:35.322
which is gonna bring
a new taste to the song.

1:02:35.355 --> 1:02:37.191
You guys should both
feel super confident

1:02:37.224 --> 1:02:39.092
because you sound amazing.
Yeah.

1:02:39.126 --> 1:02:41.128
Honestly, to get advice
from John and Camila

1:02:41.161 --> 1:02:44.665
and to even have them hear me
sing was very helpful.

1:02:44.698 --> 1:02:48.101
And they're the perfect pair
to make me grow as an artist

1:02:48.135 --> 1:02:50.404
and to to lead me
to where I should be.

1:02:50.437 --> 1:02:53.540
The key is going to be embracing
the emotion of the song,

1:02:53.574 --> 1:02:57.244
thinking about the lyric even
more, and, like, getting in it,

1:02:57.277 --> 1:02:59.246
living in it,
and so if you approach the song

1:02:59.279 --> 1:03:01.215
with that level
of confidence

1:03:01.248 --> 1:03:03.584
and embracing of the emotion
of the song,

1:03:03.617 --> 1:03:06.253
if you give us all of that,
it's gonna be so beautiful

1:03:06.286 --> 1:03:09.423
and so effective,
and I can't wait to hear it.

1:03:09.456 --> 1:03:11.158
These two singers
are very different,

1:03:11.191 --> 1:03:14.294
but I have to believe
that I can depend on them

1:03:14.328 --> 1:03:15.796
to go out there and deliver.

1:03:15.829 --> 1:03:18.565
So both of them have
the ability to deliver,

1:03:18.599 --> 1:03:21.668
but we're gonna see, when
it comes time for the battle,

1:03:21.702 --> 1:03:23.237
who steps up to the plate.

1:03:23.270 --> 1:03:24.738
It's amazing.
You guys should feel so good.

1:03:24.771 --> 1:03:26.206
It's amazing.
Thank you so much, guys.

1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:27.741
Alright. Thank you.
Great job, guys.

1:03:27.774 --> 1:03:29.710
Thank you.
Team Legend, hey!

1:03:29.743 --> 1:03:32.746
Legendary behavior.

1:03:32.779 --> 1:03:34.381
I love it.
Other way.

Jack and Sabrina,
I loved that song before,

1:06:25.352 --> 1:06:27.054
but that was cool as hell,
y'all.

1:06:27.087 --> 1:06:29.022
Like, how you were connecting
with each other

1:06:29.056 --> 1:06:30.791
and the storytelling
with your bodies,

1:06:30.824 --> 1:06:33.260
not just your vocals,
that was really cool.

1:06:33.293 --> 1:06:34.494
Yeah.
Yeah.

1:06:34.528 --> 1:06:35.796
Thank you.

1:06:35.829 --> 1:06:37.364
Jack, your voice is
so beautiful.

1:06:37.397 --> 1:06:39.466
That tone is so cool.
Thank you.

1:06:39.499 --> 1:06:41.535
And then you got up high,
and it sounded like, oh,

1:06:41.568 --> 1:06:43.036
like your ‐‐
like, heart‐wrenching.

1:06:43.070 --> 1:06:45.038
It was really,
really well done.

1:06:45.072 --> 1:06:47.474
Sabrina, you might be
one of my favorite humans

1:06:47.508 --> 1:06:49.076
I've ever encountered.

1:06:49.109 --> 1:06:50.677
You're really
something special.

1:06:50.711 --> 1:06:52.513
It's like you tell
the whole story

1:06:52.546 --> 1:06:54.114
with every part of your being.

1:06:54.147 --> 1:06:55.349
It reminded me of P! nk.

1:06:55.382 --> 1:06:56.783
Like, I love P!nk.
I'm a huge fan.

1:06:56.817 --> 1:06:59.219
You moved me in that way.
I love your voice.

1:06:59.253 --> 1:07:02.055
I'm gonna have to lean
towards Sabrina on this one.

1:07:02.089 --> 1:07:03.190
Thank you.

1:07:05.592 --> 1:07:07.528
Great job, both of you.

1:07:07.561 --> 1:07:10.531
Jack, man, that tone,
that voice you have ‐‐

1:07:10.564 --> 1:07:11.798
it truly is really special.

1:07:11.832 --> 1:07:13.567
When you got up
to that high stuff,

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:15.235
that was emotional to me.

1:07:15.269 --> 1:07:18.372
Felt like you were giving it
every single thing you had.

1:07:18.405 --> 1:07:20.007
And then, Sabrina, I mean,

1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:22.009
you just have
this charisma about you,

1:07:22.042 --> 1:07:24.111
and that's
pretty damn special.

1:07:24.144 --> 1:07:25.679
Your voice is explosive.

1:07:25.712 --> 1:07:28.749
And it's also endearing
and draws a person in.

1:07:28.782 --> 1:07:31.785
So I would probably
choose Sabrina.

1:07:31.818 --> 1:07:33.687
Thank you.

1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:36.757
That was a really beautiful
rendition of this song.

1:07:36.790 --> 1:07:39.793
You both told the story
in totally different ways.

1:07:39.826 --> 1:07:42.596
I really enjoyed the journey
of your softer,

1:07:42.629 --> 1:07:44.131
gorgeous tone
in the beginning.

1:07:44.164 --> 1:07:46.333
That's a really special voice
that you have.

1:07:46.366 --> 1:07:47.601
And then, Sabrina, everybody

1:07:47.634 --> 1:07:49.303
falls in l
ove withyou watching
you.

1:07:49.336 --> 1:07:52.105
I think that makes it
really hard for you, John,

1:07:52.139 --> 1:07:55.008
'cause they're both
so stunningly talented.

1:07:55.042 --> 1:07:57.644
I don't know. I'm, like,
right in the middle on this one.

1:07:57.678 --> 1:08:00.080
Thank you, coaches.
Alright, Johnny.

1:08:00.113 --> 1:08:01.715
Give us some thoughts
before you tell us who won.

1:08:01.748 --> 1:08:03.183
Well, it's so interesting.

1:08:03.217 --> 1:08:05.419
Jack has almost
never performed before

1:08:05.452 --> 1:08:06.720
prior to coming to "The Voice."

1:08:06.753 --> 1:08:08.155
Literally...
Wow!

1:08:08.188 --> 1:08:10.190
...this is the beginning
of his singing.

1:08:12.626 --> 1:08:15.596
And you delivered.
It was so well done.

1:08:15.629 --> 1:08:17.698
And I think
he's more comfortable

1:08:17.731 --> 1:08:19.199
living in that lower part
of his range,

1:08:19.233 --> 1:08:22.402
and it's gorgeous
and it has so much heart to it.

1:08:22.436 --> 1:08:23.770
But you were, like, concerned

1:08:23.804 --> 1:08:25.572
about hitting
those higher notes.

1:08:25.606 --> 1:08:27.574
So it's very exciting
to see that.

1:08:27.608 --> 1:08:30.210
Thank you for pushing me.
I appreciate it.
Yes.

1:08:30.244 --> 1:08:33.146
Happy to.
Sabrina, I'm so intrigued
by you

1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:35.616
because hearing your voice
shred the way it does,

1:08:35.649 --> 1:08:37.417
I want to see you sing
some rock 'n' roll.

1:08:37.451 --> 1:08:40.053
Like, I was thinking about P! nk
when I was watching you perform.

1:08:40.087 --> 1:08:42.556
And P! nk has that way
of straddling pop and rock,

1:08:42.589 --> 1:08:45.225
and I just feel like
you have so much energy.

1:08:45.259 --> 1:08:47.461
It's very attractive.
It's very magnetic.
Thank you.

1:08:47.494 --> 1:08:48.762
You're really good.

1:08:48.795 --> 1:08:50.764
John, who is the winner
of this battle?

1:08:50.797 --> 1:08:52.666

1:08:52.699 --> 1:08:55.002
and this is not easy.

1:08:57.404 --> 1:09:00.107

moving on to the knockouts!

She's just full of energy
and bounce in her step.

1:09:10.684 --> 1:09:12.653
Her voice is
a bit more electric.

1:09:12.686 --> 1:09:14.121

and connects so well.

1:11:36.830 --> 1:11:39.233
I got to high‐five
and hug Blake.
Welcome.

1:11:39.266 --> 1:11:40.601
I even got to meet Ariana.

1:11:40.634 --> 1:11:43.036
That was crazy,
'cause I'm a huge fan of her.

1:11:43.770 --> 1:11:47.241
Several months ago, I was
managing content on websites.

1:11:47.274 --> 1:11:51.778
But losing my mom pushed me
to keep going after my dreams.

1:11:51.812 --> 1:11:54.748
So to think that I'm here today
is so crazy.

1:11:54.781 --> 1:11:58.151
I will be honoring my mom
through this performance.

1:11:58.185 --> 1:12:00.087
Manny and Wendy are
coming out.
Yes. Yeah.

1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:02.422
Hey, what if you know
the adviser?

1:12:02.456 --> 1:12:04.024
What if they're
your friend?

1:12:04.057 --> 1:12:05.559
I know a lot of people
that ‐‐
You're a legend.

1:12:05.592 --> 1:12:07.294
No, I'm a legend
in my own mind.
You know everybody.

1:12:07.327 --> 1:12:10.497
Wendy ‐‐ I just sang with her
in Nashville like two weeks ago.

1:12:10.531 --> 1:12:13.300
With Wendy?
Yeah, she was us
and Brothers Osborne.

1:12:13.333 --> 1:12:14.268
What?

1:12:14.301 --> 1:12:16.537
What if you know them?
I...

1:12:16.570 --> 1:12:18.405
Give me Manny and Wendy.

1:12:18.438 --> 1:12:20.140
Wow. That's the way
it works, huh?

1:12:20.174 --> 1:12:22.543
Oh, my gosh!
What's up?

1:12:22.576 --> 1:12:23.677
Wow.
How are you doing?

1:12:23.710 --> 1:12:25.112
I don't even know
what to do.
Hey.

1:12:25.145 --> 1:12:27.414
I have to tell you,
I was very shocked

1:12:27.447 --> 1:12:29.082
to see Dierks Bentley.

1:12:29.116 --> 1:12:30.584
There's no introduction here.
They know each other.

1:12:30.617 --> 1:12:32.019
It blew my mind,

1:12:32.052 --> 1:12:33.554
and Manny was like,
"See, I told you."

1:12:33.587 --> 1:12:36.123
I'm like, "Yeah, but how did
he remember me?"

1:12:36.156 --> 1:12:37.658
Why'd you choose
Blake over ‐‐ Why?

1:12:37.691 --> 1:12:39.026
I'm surprised
you didn't choose John.

1:12:39.059 --> 1:12:40.727
Because...

1:12:40.761 --> 1:12:42.596
♪ We
can work it out

1:12:42.629 --> 1:12:45.732
♪ Yeah, oh

1:12:45.766 --> 1:12:51.205
Blake used his only block for me
against John Legend.

1:12:51.238 --> 1:12:52.472
What's up with that?

1:12:52.506 --> 1:12:54.141
I'm so glad to be
on your team!

1:12:54.174 --> 1:12:57.044
You're happy I blocked John.
You hear that, John?

1:12:57.077 --> 1:12:58.078
I'm sorry, John.

1:12:58.111 --> 1:12:59.713
I just ‐‐
I love you, too, John.

1:12:59.746 --> 1:13:02.316
Honestly, I live in Nashville,
I work in Nashville,

1:13:02.349 --> 1:13:04.718
so it's a perfect fit.

1:13:04.751 --> 1:13:07.588
I've been engaged 25 years.

1:13:07.621 --> 1:13:09.323
He's an amazing musician.

1:13:09.356 --> 1:13:11.658
Thought about getting married
many times.

1:13:11.692 --> 1:13:14.161
But I'm still pursuing
new dreams,

1:13:14.194 --> 1:13:18.265
and he's my biggest cheerleader,
so there's nobody else for me.

1:13:18.298 --> 1:13:20.567
I've been on tour
with Julio Iglesias,

1:13:20.634 --> 1:13:22.736
Tim McGraw, Faith Hill,
Martina McBride.

1:13:22.769 --> 1:13:25.105
But it was a terrifying experience for me

1:13:25.138 --> 1:13:27.207
to try to go after something
like "The Voice."

1:13:27.241 --> 1:13:30.744
So I'm excited to represent
my team leader,

1:13:30.777 --> 1:13:32.346
my guru, Blake.

by Sting.

1:13:40.521 --> 1:13:41.755

because I feel like vocally

1:13:50.097 --> 1:13:52.232

but Wendy's been singing backup

1:13:58.071 --> 1:14:00.073
for all different genres
forever,

1:14:00.107 --> 1:14:02.509

he's doing ‐‐

1:14:10.684 --> 1:14:12.219
I couldn't do that
on my best day.

1:14:12.252 --> 1:14:14.588
And then I go over here
and Wendy's like, whoa!

1:14:14.621 --> 1:14:16.757
Oh, my God, Wendy.
That note towards the end ‐‐

1:14:16.790 --> 1:14:18.358
that's what Jeff Buckley
was talking about.

1:14:18.392 --> 1:14:20.761
That's the secret chord
that pleased the Lord.

1:14:20.794 --> 1:14:22.663
Finally,
Wendy discovered it!

1:14:22.696 --> 1:14:24.231
Manny does have
his work cut out.

1:14:24.264 --> 1:14:26.533
He's going against Wendy,
but he's a great singer.

1:14:26.567 --> 1:14:27.768
He emotes a lot of joy.

1:14:27.801 --> 1:14:32.005
I think Manny just needs
more confidence.

1:14:32.039 --> 1:14:34.641
When I'm nervous,
the last thing I can do is sing.

1:14:34.675 --> 1:14:36.376
It starts to affect
the way you breathe.

1:14:36.410 --> 1:14:38.378
So it's just, everybody
has to figure out

1:14:38.412 --> 1:14:40.480
their way
of containing that.

1:14:40.514 --> 1:14:43.383

"I'm excited

1:15:04.705 --> 1:15:06.139

and use that energy
for what it's worth.

1:15:07.674 --> 1:15:09.009
The thing that I love about
Manny's voice

1:15:09.042 --> 1:15:10.544
is there's so much
raw emotion in it,

1:15:10.577 --> 1:15:13.547

a way to control that

being the person
in front of the band now,

1:15:19.086 --> 1:15:21.355
not behind
the scenes anymore.

1:15:21.388 --> 1:15:24.691
You got to, like,
invest yourself into this song

pay attention to the song
and the lyrics,

1:15:33.100 --> 1:15:34.268
like a real artist.

1:15:34.301 --> 1:15:36.036
Just find a way to, like,
take the song

1:15:36.069 --> 1:15:37.304
and internalize it.

1:15:37.337 --> 1:15:39.139
It can't just go from your ear
to your mouth.

1:15:39.173 --> 1:15:41.175
It has to go from your ear,
go through your heart

1:15:41.208 --> 1:15:42.676
that's really been
broken once or twice,

1:15:42.709 --> 1:15:44.044
and then come out
your mouth.

1:15:44.077 --> 1:15:45.412
Wendy has a lot of power
in her voice,

1:15:45.445 --> 1:15:47.447
but Manny ‐‐
he made you feel like he lived

1:15:47.481 --> 1:15:48.615
every line of the song.

1:15:48.649 --> 1:15:50.184
Swing for the fence.

Yeah. Wow.
Okay.

1:15:56.156 --> 1:15:58.025
Manny needs a confidence boost,

1:15:58.058 --> 1:16:01.461
but Wendy also needs to step up
and be the front artist.

1:16:01.495 --> 1:16:03.263
I'm so happy
you chose me, too.

1:16:03.297 --> 1:16:06.066

1:20:29.196 --> 1:20:32.399
Every time you perform for us,

1:20:32.432 --> 1:20:33.634
I don't stop thinking about it.

1:20:33.667 --> 1:20:35.369
So good for you.
Oh, my God.

1:20:35.402 --> 1:20:37.604
Good for you.
You both were incredible.

1:20:37.638 --> 1:20:39.273
But I would have to
give this to Wendy.

1:20:41.375 --> 1:20:42.609
Thank you!

1:20:42.643 --> 1:20:44.478
Blake, you're really
styling your team...

1:20:44.511 --> 1:20:47.381
Man, I'm telling you.
...very well this season.

1:20:47.414 --> 1:20:50.417
That's right out of my closet.
Yes, I know.

1:20:50.450 --> 1:20:52.653
Yes.
And then you give her
this beautiful cape.

1:20:52.686 --> 1:20:54.354
I thought that's what
what he was talking about.

1:20:54.388 --> 1:20:56.757
That's from his closet.

1:20:56.790 --> 1:21:01.562
But honestly, both of you
look like stars up there.

1:21:01.595 --> 1:21:03.797
If I had one
just minor note,

1:21:03.830 --> 1:21:06.500
it felt like you were giving
very different

1:21:06.533 --> 1:21:08.001
interpretations physically.

1:21:08.035 --> 1:21:10.370
It felt like
you weren't performing together.

1:21:10.404 --> 1:21:13.574
But I love you both.

1:21:13.607 --> 1:21:15.509
Manny, you were almost
like the music.

1:21:15.542 --> 1:21:16.777
You were the vibe.

1:21:16.810 --> 1:21:18.512
I couldn't keep my eyes
off of you, Manny.

1:21:18.545 --> 1:21:20.314
I loved your runs.
I love your vibrato.

1:21:20.347 --> 1:21:22.082
Thank you.
It's so cool.

1:21:22.115 --> 1:21:23.550
And then, you know, Wendy,

1:21:23.584 --> 1:21:25.485
you were the words,
you were the message.

1:21:25.519 --> 1:21:27.621
I've done quite a few
singing competitions

1:21:27.654 --> 1:21:29.523
all over the world.
Navigated them.

1:21:29.556 --> 1:21:31.692
I've navigated them.
This is literally

1:21:31.725 --> 1:21:34.394
one of the best things
I've ever heard ever.

1:21:34.428 --> 1:21:36.263
Thank you.
You were a four‐chair turn.

1:21:36.296 --> 1:21:37.564
We all wanted you on our team.

1:21:37.598 --> 1:21:40.167
We're all still wondering
why you're on Blake's.

1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:41.668
If you don't make the finale,

1:21:41.702 --> 1:21:44.471
something's wrong in the world
,is what I'
m sayi
ng.

1:21:44.505 --> 1:21:47.341
Thank you, coaches.

1:21:47.374 --> 1:21:49.343
Blake, you got
the final decision, buddy.

1:21:49.376 --> 1:21:50.477
Give us some thoughts
on the battle first.

1:21:50.511 --> 1:21:52.246
Well, I want
the audience to know

1:21:52.279 --> 1:21:56.383
that when Wendy came to
this show, she couldn't sing.

1:21:56.416 --> 1:21:58.252
And that's what
two rehearsals ‐‐

1:21:58.285 --> 1:22:00.354
Stop.
Two rehearsals...

1:22:00.387 --> 1:22:02.022
No.
That's right.

1:22:02.055 --> 1:22:03.624
...with me,
and this is what happens.

1:22:03.657 --> 1:22:06.460
"I am so powerful."
I just ‐‐ Thank you.

1:22:06.493 --> 1:22:08.295
Thank you guys. Thank you.

1:22:08.328 --> 1:22:11.431
Thank you guys.

1:22:11.465 --> 1:22:12.699
Thank you.

1:22:12.733 --> 1:22:14.268
I mean...

1:22:16.270 --> 1:22:18.572
That's what happened.
I believe him.
I believe him.

1:22:18.605 --> 1:22:21.575
I want to talk about Manny
because Manny knew

1:22:21.608 --> 1:22:23.477
what he's up against here.

1:22:23.510 --> 1:22:26.380
You stood toe‐to‐toe
with Wendy up there,

1:22:26.413 --> 1:22:28.348
and, man, you sang
the hell out of it,

1:22:28.382 --> 1:22:31.518
and you had challenges,
you had problems in rehearsals,

1:22:31.552 --> 1:22:33.387
and you figured out a way
to get through it

1:22:33.420 --> 1:22:35.489
and get better
and then get better.

1:22:35.522 --> 1:22:38.592
So thank you for
all the hard work, dude.

1:22:38.625 --> 1:22:40.761
Thank you. Thank you.

1:22:40.794 --> 1:22:44.097
Wendy, I mean, I got to agree
with everybody else.

1:22:44.131 --> 1:22:46.533
I don't know why you chose me
as your coach,

1:22:46.567 --> 1:22:48.569
but thank you
to "The Voice" gods

1:22:48.602 --> 1:22:51.305
for shining down on me
in that moment.

1:22:51.338 --> 1:22:53.240
Thank you.
I love you guys.

1:22:53.273 --> 1:22:55.309
Thank you, Blake.

1:22:55.342 --> 1:22:56.443
Two great singers.

1:22:56.476 --> 1:22:59.246
Who is the winner
of this battle?

1:23:04.284 --> 1:23:05.919
Winner of this battle...

1:23:09.156 --> 1:23:10.390
...is Wendy.

1:23:10.424 --> 1:23:11.758
Congratulations!

1:23:11.792 --> 1:23:14.494
Wendy Moten moving on
to the knockouts

1:23:14.528 --> 1:23:16.763
for Team Blake!

1:23:16.797 --> 1:23:19.433
I'm so glad
that I won this battle

1:23:19.466 --> 1:23:21.668
and that I'm still on his team!

1:23:21.702 --> 1:23:24.705
Today they've given me props
that I still got it.

1:23:25.372 --> 1:23:28.008
Coaches, let me remind you that
Manny's available to steal.

1:23:28.041 --> 1:23:29.776
Manny, anything you want
to say to Blake?

1:23:29.810 --> 1:23:32.513
Man, I'm just so grateful
to you, Blake,

1:23:32.546 --> 1:23:35.249
for believing in me
and giving me a chance.

1:23:35.282 --> 1:23:36.783
I lost my mom
a few years ago

1:23:36.817 --> 1:23:38.585
and I'm doing this
in honor of her.

1:23:38.619 --> 1:23:40.687
This is a huge accomplishment.
I'm so honored.

1:23:40.721 --> 1:23:42.289
I will never forget this.
Thank you

1:23:42.322 --> 1:23:45.125
Give it up for Manny Keith,
ladies and gentlemen!

1:23:47.194 --> 1:23:48.395
Fantastic.

1:23:48.428 --> 1:23:49.630
There you go.

1:23:49.663 --> 1:23:51.164
There it is!
Look at that!

1:23:51.198 --> 1:23:52.799
That's the sound of steal!
That's you!

1:23:52.833 --> 1:23:55.068
That's you, Manny!
Ariana Grande...

1:23:55.102 --> 1:23:56.603
That's you, Manny!

1:23:56.637 --> 1:23:58.505
...steals Manny Keith!

1:24:00.174 --> 1:24:02.776
I'm so grateful
that's where I used my steal.

1:24:02.809 --> 1:24:04.645
I can't wait to see
what he does in the knockouts.

1:24:04.678 --> 1:24:07.314
I think he can absolutely shine
in his own right

1:24:07.347 --> 1:24:09.049
if given the opportunity
to do so.

1:24:09.082 --> 1:24:10.083
Nice steal.

1:24:10.117 --> 1:24:11.552
Obviously, Wendy is one of

1:24:11.585 --> 1:24:13.220
the most incredible vocalists

1:24:13.253 --> 1:24:14.555
I've ever heard in my life,

1:24:14.588 --> 1:24:16.323
whether we're talking about
this show or not.

1:24:16.356 --> 1:24:18.525
That was a good one.
But couldn't be happier
for that guy.

1:24:18.559 --> 1:24:19.660
He deserves it.

1:24:19.693 --> 1:24:21.762
I forgot something.

1:24:21.795 --> 1:24:23.397
It's your Team Ariana
lunch box.

1:24:23.430 --> 1:24:26.099
For Ariana to steal me,
who I'm a huge fan of

1:24:26.133 --> 1:24:28.769
and I look up to her,
I'm just so thankful.

1:24:28.802 --> 1:24:30.504
He did a really good job.
He was very good.

1:24:30.537 --> 1:24:32.072
Yeah, he did.
He was very good.

1:24:32.105 --> 1:24:33.040
But she's crazy.

1:24:33.073 --> 1:24:35.475
I knew, too, like, when
she was playing it cool,

1:24:35.509 --> 1:24:37.711
I was like,
"She about to tear it up."

1:24:37.744 --> 1:24:40.614
Everything in my body was like,
"It's about to happen."

1:24:40.647 --> 1:24:43.183
I just got to prepare.
Blake, you're lucky.

1:24:43.217 --> 1:24:44.184
Yeah.
