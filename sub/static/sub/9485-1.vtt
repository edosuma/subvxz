Just working.

03:11.070 --> 03:12.200
Salad.

03:13.250 --> 03:16.510
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.

03:16.590 --> 03:19.120
I didn't realise that
you were gonna be back so early.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.730
Great. I'll see you in a bit.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.860
Okay, bye.

Hey, you got here fast.
I got a surprise for you.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.520
Peter, as you know,

04:16.959 --> 04:19.870
I love you very much.

04:24.260 --> 04:26.140
Are you breaking up with me?

04:32.180 --> 04:35.960
- Pete, are you...
- I just need a minute.

04:37.830 --> 04:38.880
Okay.

04:58.580 --> 04:59.620
Please don't go.

04:59.710 --> 05:02.620
Why don't you just put on some clothes,
and we can sit down and discuss this.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.020
No. I can't do anything right now.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.880
I'm so sorry, Pete.

05:06.710 --> 05:07.840
I'm in love with you.

05:07.970 --> 05:09.620
Why don't you just
put some clothes on, okay?

05:09.710 --> 05:11.410
I'm not going to go put clothes on.

05:11.630 --> 05:15.280
I know what that means,
if I put clothes on, it's over. Okay?

05:17.840 --> 05:18.890
Excuse me.

05:26.020 --> 05:28.800
Let's talk. Let's talk about him.

05:31.020 --> 05:32.240
I feel...

05:34.240 --> 05:36.110
I've been feeling

05:37.370 --> 05:40.290
for a long time
that we've been growing apart.

05:41.420 --> 05:43.720
We're leading different lives.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.460
Who's the dude?

05:48.850 --> 05:49.980
- Who's the dude?
- What?

05:50.070 --> 05:54.250
No, that's not what this is about.
There's no one else.

05:54.460 --> 05:56.640
I know what's happening here. I really do.

05:56.770 --> 06:00.200
You've been working so much lately, that we
haven't got to spend much time together,

06:00.290 --> 06:01.550
and you're forgetting
what it's like to be with me.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.860
But maybe, if we just held each other
or something,

06:03.940 --> 06:05.420
you would remember
what it's like to be with me.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.210
- No.
- Just hold me.

06:12.290 --> 06:14.600
Please. Here we go.

06:21.690 --> 06:23.560
There's someone else.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.300
I'm sorry.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.170
We don't hang out in places like this,
Liz and I.

06:49.220 --> 06:52.960
Why did you take me here?
This place smells like stripper's perfume.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.520
I'm gonna get herpes
just from sitting on this couch.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.520
- Sure you okay, bro? Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:59.660 --> 07:02.350
Yeah. You don't have to keep asking me.
I'm good.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.830
<i>- You're out!
- Thank you so much for this opportunity.</i>

07:05.050 --> 07:06.310
- Auf Wiedersehen!
- Auf Wiedersehen!

07:08.480 --> 07:10.270
<i>MAN ON T. V..:
Thank you. Thank you all.</i>

07:10.480 --> 07:11.530
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

07:13.700 --> 07:15.400
I feel really good. I feel happy.

07:15.570 --> 07:18.400
<i>Maybe you should work
on the Dracula musical.</i>

07:18.530 --> 07:21.840
Look, you've been working on it for a
while. It'll help your mind. Be creative.

07:21.970 --> 07:23.840
- Think about you.
- I think I need to fuck somebody.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:25.180 --> 07:28.180
You're not my stepbrother any more.
You're a step-stranger.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.880
- Why you talking like that?
- Brian!

07:29.970 --> 07:31.970
You don't need to put
your P in a V right now.

07:32.060 --> 07:36.540
No, I don't.
I need to B my L on somebody's T's.

07:36.670 --> 07:39.140
That's disgusting.
You don't need to be doing that.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.750
And if anything,
you should leave your P in the V

07:41.970 --> 07:45.540
and blow it inside the V,
so you can have a B-A-B-Y

07:45.620 --> 07:46.890
and be a normal person.

07:46.970 --> 07:48.760
I'm leaving, man. I'm out of here.

07:48.970 --> 07:52.710
She's fucking somebody.
Okay, Bri? It's all I can think about,

07:52.930 --> 07:54.190
is that she's out there,

07:54.280 --> 07:56.980
and until I do the same thing,
I'm gonna feel like I wanna die.

07:57.110 --> 08:01.060
So just talk to girls with me tonight,
all right?

08:01.280 --> 08:05.110
All right. All right, I'll help you out.
I'll talk to girls with you.

08:06.590 --> 08:08.460
So, Peter, what do you do?

08:08.670 --> 08:10.020
Musician.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.890
<i>He's being modest.
He works on a show called Crime Scene.</i>

08:15.110 --> 08:16.890
Oh, my God!

08:17.020 --> 08:19.810
- It is what it is, you know?
- No, I love that show.

08:19.940 --> 08:23.070
<i>Wait, Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime
or Crime Scene: Phoenix?</i>

08:23.160 --> 08:26.900
<i>- Scene of the Crime.
- Oh, my God! I love that show.</i>

08:28.160 --> 08:31.070
I find you both very sexually attractive.

08:32.770 --> 08:35.460
Let's pump the brakes. Okay?

08:35.549 --> 08:37.860
I think that having sex with either of you

08:37.940 --> 08:40.679
would be a great treat for me.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.470
You are so funny.

08:44.030 --> 08:46.420
I just got out of
a five-and-a-half-year relationship,

08:46.600 --> 08:49.340
so I'm not looking for anything serious.

08:49.860 --> 08:53.730
- Just sexual activity.
- Let's wrap it up, buddy.

08:54.340 --> 08:56.120
You wanna come home?

08:57.860 --> 09:00.300
I'm sorry, you're cracking me up.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.170
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.120
Do you wanna come home?

09:04.860 --> 09:06.520
Stop it, seriously.

09:12.690 --> 09:15.820
- That was fun.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:16.560 --> 09:19.350
Overall, I think that
went really well. Yeah.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.830
I want to have sex with you!

09:39.790 --> 09:42.400
- Are you crying?
- What? No.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.010
I'm sorry that I'm being so weird now.

09:47.310 --> 09:49.090
No, that's okay.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.350
You've been weird

09:52.310 --> 09:57.530
pretty much the whole time,
so it's not unusual. Okay.

09:58.050 --> 10:01.580
Last night, like some sort of idiot, I had
sex with this woman who I barely even know.

10:03.660 --> 10:05.880
I used a condom, but

10:07.010 --> 10:09.840
I'm really scared that I have an STD, Doc.

10:10.230 --> 10:12.530
Peter, I'm a paediatrician. Have you
noticed you're sitting on a fire truck?

10:14.320 --> 10:16.190
- Right.
- Little kids running?

10:16.270 --> 10:19.840
- Yeah, this is new. I like it.
- I'm kind of backed up...

10:20.060 --> 10:22.450
Could you take a look at my penis?

10:24.840 --> 10:26.320
Go ahead. Let me see it.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.020
- Sorry.
- That's all right. Take it out.

10:30.670 --> 10:31.710
Good.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.540
- You barely looked at it.
- It's a good-looking dick, Peter.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.320
- Beautiful dick.
- Do you think maybe while I'm here,

10:36.410 --> 10:38.410
- I could get some blood work?
- Peter!

10:38.800 --> 10:40.280
Your girlfriend dumped you, right?
Are you hurting? Are you hurt?

10:42.590 --> 10:46.760
Stop it. Stop crying. Use your dick.
Keep fucking. Fuck everything that moves.

10:47.070 --> 10:48.110
Just wear a condom.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.760
Listen, I'm backed up,
I got a lot of kids. I gotta go, okay?

10:51.850 --> 10:55.420
You want something?
You want a balloon? You want a lolly?

11:05.420 --> 11:06.770
I just came!

11:23.120 --> 11:24.160
Hi.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.030
Hi.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.730
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:30.950 --> 11:32.080
Hi.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.040
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:38.250 --> 11:43.990
Okay, do you mind not saying that
over and over again?

11:45.040 --> 11:46.470
You can gag me.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.170
- You brought a gag?
- And handcuffs.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.520
Do you wanna gag me?

11:57.350 --> 11:58.780
Kind of, now.

12:04.650 --> 12:06.390
What've we got today?

12:06.830 --> 12:08.780
Just a walk and talk at the lab.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.920
<i>That's what 20 years on
Vice will do to you.</i>

12:15.260 --> 12:16.610
<i>What've we got here?</i>

12:16.740 --> 12:19.740
<i>The victim's penis was found
behind the AC unit.</i>

12:20.270 --> 12:21.610
<i>Ouch!</i>

12:22.050 --> 12:24.220
<i>Can you say "dicksicle"?</i>

12:26.750 --> 12:28.310
<i>Let's do this.</i>

12:30.270 --> 12:31.830
Okay, I'm ready.

12:32.790 --> 12:35.920
<i>The victim's penis
was found behind the AC unit.</i>

12:39.570 --> 12:42.580
Just go with the usual stuff, maybe.
Something dark and ominous.

12:42.710 --> 12:45.320
Like losing your penis is a bad thing.

12:48.010 --> 12:50.320
Oh, you want dark and ominous.

12:50.930 --> 12:54.670
Come on, I got Allman Brother tickets,
I gotta get out of here!

12:55.620 --> 12:58.540
<i>That's what 20 years on
Vice will do to you.</i>

12:59.890 --> 13:01.750
<i>What've we got here?</i>

13:01.890 --> 13:04.060
Peter! Peter, Jesus Christ!

13:04.190 --> 13:06.970
You're fucking Billy Baldwin, aren't you?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.500
- Aren't you?
- Pete, Pete, Pete.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.670
- Stop staring at me.
- Pete!

13:14.190 --> 13:16.800
You know you're not getting paid
for today's session, right?

13:16.980 --> 13:19.280
- I'm aware of that.
- Fucking asshole.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.630
Peter, it's Brian.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.020
Go away.

13:25.980 --> 13:28.370
Listen, your landlord called me.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.150
Said there's smoke
coming out of your place.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.070
Who, Mr Lopez? 'Cause he's a liar!

13:33.760 --> 13:34.810
He doesn't...

13:35.020 --> 13:36.900
We worry about you, Petey.

13:37.030 --> 13:39.420
Yeah, come on, Peter. Open up the door.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.770
The fire marshal's gonna come in
and bust it down.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.770
You haven't been
out of the house in two weeks.

13:50.900 --> 13:51.940
Why are you so damn strong?

13:52.030 --> 13:54.640
I feel so strong!

13:55.070 --> 13:58.380
Hey, don't walk away from me.
You come close.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.820
Your place is disgusting, Peter.

14:02.030 --> 14:02.990
Hey, don't walk away from me.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

14:06.120 --> 14:07.860
What are you burning, man? Come on.

14:07.990 --> 14:09.030
It's everything.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.860
It's everything that reminds me of her
and I need it gone!

14:11.950 --> 14:16.120
Okay, I thought I was fine, Brian,
and I'm not. I'm not fine at all.

14:16.340 --> 14:19.120
Okay, let's just put the picture down.

14:19.250 --> 14:22.170
Put that down. Let's discuss this.

14:22.260 --> 14:24.340
- I love her, man.
- I know.

14:24.560 --> 14:30.300
Look, Liz and I, we think
the world of Sarah.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.300
We think she's great.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.780
Okay, but everything...

14:35.300 --> 14:36.960
I'm just being honest here.

14:37.090 --> 14:40.300
Every time she would come over
to our house,

14:41.560 --> 14:43.220
she always acted,

14:44.390 --> 14:47.700
you know, like a little bitch!

14:48.870 --> 14:50.740
Okay, okay, pump the brakes.

14:50.830 --> 14:54.090
Dating Sarah is not like dating Liz. Okay?

14:54.260 --> 14:56.180
Sarah is better than Liz.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.960
You really wanna have this conversation?

14:59.920 --> 15:02.610
Do you really
wanna have this conversation?

15:03.960 --> 15:05.010
Yes.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.010
- She is the mother of my unborn child.
- Sorry.

15:07.090 --> 15:08.490
You're my stepbrother.
We're not even blood.

15:10.140 --> 15:12.620
I have no qualms with sticking you.
I will equalize you.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.310
- Sorry.
- You dick!

15:14.700 --> 15:16.180
I'm just worked up.

15:17.010 --> 15:19.620
You gotta get your shit together, man.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.790
I'm trying to. It's so hard here.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.140
Brian, everywhere I look,
I'm reminded of her, okay?

15:25.360 --> 15:28.060
Like, she got me this,

15:28.800 --> 15:31.840
okay, because I would always leave
my cereal boxes open,

15:32.010 --> 15:33.270
and the cereal would get stale,

15:33.490 --> 15:36.190
and so one day I came home,
and she had this waiting for me,

15:36.320 --> 15:40.490
because it keeps my cereal fresh.
And now I have the freshest cereal.

15:43.930 --> 15:45.580
Why don't you,
you know what, go on a vacation?

15:45.670 --> 15:47.370
Go to the Alps.

15:47.450 --> 15:50.370
- Alps?
- Go to Gstaad. It's the best.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.760
I could go to Hawaii.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.670
Sarah was always talking about this place
in Hawaii that was supposed to be nice.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.410
No, don't. I wouldn't go there.

15:56.540 --> 16:00.200
What, I can't go to Hawaii now, because
Sarah Marshall has heard of Hawaii?

16:00.280 --> 16:02.590
Then go to Hawaii. Go to Hawaii.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.240
Do it.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.070
No, no, no, don't destroy the computer.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.420
I'm just deleting these pictures.

16:13.550 --> 16:16.030
Okay, I need them off my computer.

16:17.590 --> 16:20.810
You know what? You're not even doing
a proper permanent delete.

16:20.940 --> 16:22.200
Well...

16:22.290 --> 16:25.120
If we end up getting back together,
I wanna have a few of them left.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.250
You're crazy.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.380
- No, no, please don't delete them.
- They have to go. Done, done.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.250
<i>That was hilarious. Aloha!</i>

16:46.470 --> 16:49.510
<i>I'm Sarah Marshall from Crime Scene:
Scene of the crime.</i>

16:49.600 --> 16:52.210
<i>And when I'm not scrubbing for evidence,
I'm flying Hawaiian Airlines...</i>

16:52.430 --> 16:53.340
Excuse me! Hi.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.820
<i>...to my favourite destinations. Mahalo.</i>

16:54.910 --> 16:56.600
Hi, can I have another bloody mary, please?

16:58.170 --> 17:00.260
You're still working on that one.

17:00.340 --> 17:02.870
It's just an anticipatory order.

17:02.950 --> 17:04.950
Okay, I'll be right back!

17:16.829 --> 17:18.910
<i>What do you think caused
such excessive bleeding?</i>

17:19.130 --> 17:23.170
<i>He was either stabbed in the aorta
or it was his time of the month.</i>

17:34.960 --> 17:36.140
<i>Aloha!</i>

17:37.270 --> 17:39.140
Check in this way.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.570
- Just married?
- Yes, how did you guess?

17:52.790 --> 17:56.440
Oh, you've got that magic newlywed dust
all over you.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.100
- Oh, my wife.
- Oh, my husband.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.880
- Oh, my wife.
- My husband.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.970
My old ball and chain.

18:08.230 --> 18:10.620
You quit squirming and come here.

18:11.450 --> 18:13.540
What is into you?

18:14.280 --> 18:15.840
Not me, yet.

18:15.930 --> 18:20.020
Here is your room key.
So you're all set. Room 222.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.190
Room key's inside,
and the elevators are to the right.

18:22.410 --> 18:23.450
<i>Mahalo.</i>

18:23.540 --> 18:25.100
Congratulations.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.800
Here you go, sir. Have some POG juice.

18:29.930 --> 18:31.890
Welcome to Turtle Bay.
What can I do for you?

18:32.020 --> 18:34.190
I'm checking in.
My name's Bretter, Peter Bretter,

18:34.280 --> 18:35.330
but actually, I don't have a reservation.

18:37.110 --> 18:39.630
I just thought I'd take my chances.

18:40.980 --> 18:42.110
Bold!

18:42.850 --> 18:46.810
We are all booked up,
but we do have the Kapua suite available.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.720
- Okay. How much is that?
- $6,000 a night.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.850
- Wow.
- Beautiful views.

18:52.980 --> 18:54.940
I can imagine.
That's a little bit out of my price range.

18:55.030 --> 18:56.810
Sorry.

18:56.940 --> 18:59.330
That's a shame. This is a beautiful

19:01.200 --> 19:02.330
hotel.

19:03.290 --> 19:06.200
<i>Oh, yeah, it's Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene.</i>

19:06.810 --> 19:08.600
People are excited that she's here.

19:10.290 --> 19:13.510
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up three weeks ago.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.810
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Right. This is fine, right?

19:15.900 --> 19:18.820
- Sir?
- It's totally fine. Okay, there she is.

19:21.210 --> 19:24.120
- Did she see me? Is she coming over here?
- Uh-huh. Yup.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.900
I wish I wasn't wearing this fucking shirt.

19:26.030 --> 19:29.040
Fair enough.
Why don't you try to unbutton it?

19:30.690 --> 19:32.250
Button it back up.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.210
- Peter!
- Hey.

19:35.910 --> 19:37.990
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

19:38.520 --> 19:40.520
Came here to murder you.

19:41.130 --> 19:43.430
Really, what are you doing here?

19:44.260 --> 19:47.480
I have been having a tough time,
you know, back in LA.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.610
But then I came here, and here you are.

19:51.130 --> 19:53.430
I just think that's too crazy to be...

19:53.560 --> 19:56.040
Hello there, you little sex object.

19:56.130 --> 19:58.870
I've lost a shoe.
Have you seen it anywhere?

19:58.960 --> 20:03.040
It's like this one, but, you know,
obviously it's the opposite one.

20:04.480 --> 20:09.700
Excuse me, missus, I've lost a shoe.
Like this one. It's like this one's fellow.

20:09.830 --> 20:12.920
- Sort of the exact opposite,
in fact, of that. Uh-huh.

20:13.050 --> 20:15.440
Not an evil version, but just, you know,

20:15.530 --> 20:19.700
a shoe like this, but for the other foot.
Otherwise, I'd have two right...

20:19.830 --> 20:21.270
Aldous, this is Peter.

20:21.400 --> 20:25.230
Hey, all right, Peter.
Nice to meet you, mate. Aldous.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.700
- Good to meet you, man.
- My ex-boyfriend.

20:28.790 --> 20:30.880
Right. Hey, I'm Aldous Snow.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.360
I know who you are.
Yeah, you're very, very famous.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.440
Yeah, I am. I am for my sins.

20:35.660 --> 20:38.050
So are you staying here, as well?

20:38.190 --> 20:39.530
- I'm not, as a matter of fact...
- I'm sorry.

20:39.620 --> 20:42.140
Excuse me, Mr Bretter, Ms Marshall,

20:42.230 --> 20:46.400
but we were able to book the
Kapua suite for you, sir, for four nights.

20:49.230 --> 20:50.880
- You were?
- Yes, sir.

20:53.190 --> 20:55.190
- Marvellous.
- Perfect. Perfect amount of time.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.760
Listen, if you wanna have dinner with us
one of those nights...

20:57.890 --> 20:59.230
- Aldous.
...feel very...

20:59.320 --> 21:00.360
No.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.670
That's very gentlemanly of you,
but you two enjoy your trip.

21:02.890 --> 21:04.890
I'll be just fine on my own.

21:05.060 --> 21:07.580
- All right, Peter.
- The Kapua suite...

21:07.980 --> 21:11.460
- Have a good trip, Pete.
- I like your shirt. It's colourful.

21:11.540 --> 21:13.020
- Bye.
- Bye now.

21:13.410 --> 21:15.800
Ta-ta. I was wearing two shoes
this morning, right?

21:21.330 --> 21:23.720
Thank you. Thank you for bailing me out.
I still can't afford that room.

21:25.810 --> 21:28.110
Nobody can. It's for, like,
Oprah or, like, Céline Dion.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.460
Really, it's not a big deal.

21:29.590 --> 21:32.070
So you can stay in the suite,
but since you're not technically a guest,

21:32.290 --> 21:34.370
you have to clean up after yourself.

21:34.590 --> 21:37.070
Otherwise, here is your room key

21:38.110 --> 21:39.900
and enjoy your stay.

21:41.030 --> 21:43.250
Why are you doing this for me?

21:45.120 --> 21:48.250
She's here with some guy already?
Kind of messed up.

21:48.770 --> 21:50.120
- Right?
- Yeah.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.340
- Thank you.
- Really, it's not a big deal.

21:53.470 --> 21:54.810
Go enjoy yourself.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.730
Rachel Jansen.
A thousand times, thank you,

21:57.950 --> 22:00.120
- you know what I mean...
- Go enjoy yourself.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.730
<i>- This is a disaster!
Calm down, man.</i>

22:03.560 --> 22:04.820
<i>Are there other hotels on the island?</i>

22:04.950 --> 22:06.300
Of course there are other hotels,

22:06.380 --> 22:08.380
but I'm not leaving here,
it'll look like I'm running away.

22:08.470 --> 22:11.820
Wait. Why are you whispering?
You're not following them, are you?

22:11.910 --> 22:13.080
I had a girlfriend, right?

22:13.170 --> 22:17.210
And Liam and Noel Gallagher both had
it off with her right in front of me,

22:17.340 --> 22:18.690
so that's similar.

22:18.780 --> 22:20.260
And that was a bit awkward, actually.

22:20.470 --> 22:23.390
So if you do wanna change hotels,
I quite understand.

22:23.470 --> 22:26.000
No, no, I'm not changing hotels.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.300
Stop following
and just go back to your room, Peter.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.480
<i>- They're gone!
- Why are you looking for them?</i>

22:30.560 --> 22:32.430
<i>- I don't know.
- You're acting like an idiot.</i>

22:32.560 --> 22:34.430
<i>Run! Get out of there! Go to your room!</i>

22:34.650 --> 22:36.610
<i>- What do you think they're doing?
- Peter, go.</i>

22:36.740 --> 22:38.610
Oh, God! Okay, there they are.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.480
<i>- There they are, I see them.
- Go back to your room, Peter.</i>

22:40.570 --> 22:42.130
Peter, go back to your room.
Go back to your room, Peter.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.310
I'm going in.

22:43.390 --> 22:45.090
<i>Go back to your room, Peter.
Are you listening to me?</i>

22:45.260 --> 22:47.350
<i>Peter, go back to your room.
Peter, Peter, Peter...</i>

22:47.700 --> 22:48.740
<i>Hey!</i>

22:50.090 --> 22:51.960
Hey, nice room.

22:52.180 --> 22:53.610
<i>Go!</i>

22:54.270 --> 22:56.220
I am in the Kapua suite.

22:56.350 --> 22:59.270
<i>What are you doing? Sucker!</i>

22:59.350 --> 23:00.490
Have fun.

23:02.050 --> 23:04.050
<i>Listen, you piece of shit!</i>

23:04.660 --> 23:08.840
<i>You're an idiot. Back to your room, Peter.
Peter, back to your room.</i>

23:10.920 --> 23:12.180
Did you enjoy that?

23:12.400 --> 23:14.880
<i>- Did you like what you saw?
- That hurt a lot.</i>

23:15.010 --> 23:18.010
But I know Sarah,
and I'm pretty sure I just ruined her day.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.620
<i>You know
how we thought the killer masturbated</i>

23:35.760 --> 23:37.930
<i>before he committed each homicide?</i>

23:38.060 --> 23:39.710
<i>That's the theory.</i>

23:39.930 --> 23:42.020
<i>Take a look at the microscope.</i>

23:44.410 --> 23:47.240
<i>Oh, yeah, looks like where he's going,</i>

23:48.450 --> 23:51.060
<i>he'll need to know how to masturbate.</i>

24:03.370 --> 24:04.420
Oh, God!

24:09.110 --> 24:10.980
<i>- Hello.
Hey, Peter?</i>

24:12.240 --> 24:14.330
<i>- Sarah?
- No.</i>

24:14.420 --> 24:17.680
It's Rachel Jansen, from the front desk.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.680
<i>- Hey!
- Hey, what's going on up there?</i>

24:22.770 --> 24:25.990
I'm getting complaints
about a woman crying hysterically.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.030
Yeah, you know what, I hear her, too,

24:29.120 --> 24:32.380
and it sounds like
she's having such a hard time.

24:32.470 --> 24:35.160
I think it's coming from
the floor above me.

24:35.380 --> 24:37.250
You're on the top floor.

24:39.250 --> 24:41.250
I'll try to keep it down.

24:41.860 --> 24:44.250
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you have a nice night.</i>

24:44.340 --> 24:45.510
<i>Okay.</i>

25:00.210 --> 25:04.390
I would love to sell you some weed, Jeremy,
but I'm at my fucking job right now.

25:04.610 --> 25:08.740
Obviously, because you called me at work,
you know that I'm at my place of work.

25:08.870 --> 25:10.830
So I can't just leave here
and sell you some weed.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.260
I can sell you some weed when I'm done.

25:13.350 --> 25:16.910
<i>Hold on, I gotta call you back.
Mahalo, all right.</i>

25:17.090 --> 25:19.310
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey.

25:19.390 --> 25:21.050
I'd just like to grab some dinner, please.

25:21.260 --> 25:24.180
- Okay, great. Is your wife gonna meet you?
- No.

25:25.130 --> 25:26.700
Your girlfriend?

25:27.960 --> 25:30.220
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

25:32.140 --> 25:34.830
- You're just by yourself?
- Yeah.

25:35.350 --> 25:36.620
Sucks.

25:36.700 --> 25:40.140
Okay, so just one. Here's your wine list
and your menu. Come on.

25:40.270 --> 25:41.700
Do you want, like, a magazine
or something?

25:41.830 --> 25:44.010
It's gonna be boring
if you're just sitting by yourself.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.270
I'll be all right. Thank you.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.660
I just would be so depressed.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.100
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

25:49.230 --> 25:50.270
Thank you.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.750
The best thing is,
you have the greatest table in the house.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.060
- Oh, yeah?
- That's Aldous Snow right there.

25:57.140 --> 25:59.230
I know. I know, dude. I know.

25:59.530 --> 26:01.540
- I'm gonna ask him. I'll ask him politely.
- No, please don't, please.

26:02.750 --> 26:03.800
Mate!

26:05.060 --> 26:07.360
Why don't you come over and sit with us?
You'll be very welcome.

26:07.450 --> 26:10.710
No, thank you. I need a drink.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.020
Would you guys like a drink?

26:14.150 --> 26:16.450
Well, no, actually, because...

26:16.760 --> 26:20.280
Seven years clean.
That's what this tattoo denotes.

26:20.410 --> 26:22.800
Seven years free from drugs and alcohol.

26:22.890 --> 26:25.110
If I have just one sip of wine,

26:25.190 --> 26:29.060
by the end of the evening, I'll be,
like, rimming waiters for their tips

26:29.240 --> 26:30.410
just to get me hands on a rock.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.590
You know what I mean? Nasty.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.460
I heard that.
- Hey, what's up, man?

26:36.850 --> 26:38.630
How are you enjoying
your vegetable medley?

26:38.760 --> 26:40.200
It's mundane.

26:40.850 --> 26:43.240
It is mundane. It's great, I know.

26:43.460 --> 26:44.980
Will you marry me?

26:45.420 --> 26:47.420
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yes!

26:47.500 --> 26:49.070
- She said yes!
- Beautiful.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.240
Congratulations!

26:54.370 --> 26:57.420
I'm so excited! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:58.330 --> 26:59.510
Peter!

27:02.200 --> 27:03.460
What's up?

27:04.200 --> 27:06.160
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.

27:06.380 --> 27:07.940
Yeah, I'm good.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.950
Look, did you follow me here?
Did my assistant tell you I was coming?

27:13.030 --> 27:14.420
- No.
- Did you talk to her?

27:14.510 --> 27:18.690
No, I didn't talk to your assistant.
It's not all about you, you know.

27:18.900 --> 27:23.470
Hawaii is a beautiful place. People
come here, usually not to follow you.

27:23.900 --> 27:26.600
So you're really staying?
You're gonna stay?

27:26.730 --> 27:30.470
Yeah, I think so. I really like it here.
I feel at home here.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.250
I just love it.

27:33.470 --> 27:35.040
Yeah, you should stay.

27:35.170 --> 27:37.430
I appreciate your consideration.

27:37.780 --> 27:40.390
Sounds like Aldous probably
shared a lot of needles,

27:40.470 --> 27:42.870
so thank you for dating him after me.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.650
- I appreciate that.
- Hmm.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.960
- Hope you have a really good time here.
- Have a great dinner.

27:50.090 --> 27:51.300
Thank you.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.040
Groupie whore.

27:54.570 --> 27:56.000
Psycho stalker.

27:56.650 --> 28:01.220
You know what? It's vacation. I think
I'll just take a piña colada, please.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.920
Look at this guy.

28:11.140 --> 28:13.740
Look at this guy.

28:15.620 --> 28:18.530
Not us, buddy. Right? Not us.

28:18.750 --> 28:22.490
<i>I'm on Sex and the City.
What's up, Miranda?</i>

28:23.530 --> 28:27.620
I'm Samantha. I have sex with everyone.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.710
Maybe it's a good thing that they're here.

28:29.790 --> 28:32.710
You know what I mean?
Maybe this is a challenge from God

28:32.840 --> 28:34.790
for me to forget her. You know?

28:35.010 --> 28:39.190
Or maybe it's a sign from God
that you should be with her.

28:40.100 --> 28:41.800
I love her show.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.620
When they mix the sexuality
and the violence, I like it.

28:45.750 --> 28:48.060
What the hell is wrong with you two?
You gotta move on.

28:48.150 --> 28:50.320
I hear you say that, but
it's not that easy.

28:50.450 --> 28:52.620
It's that easy. Promise you it is.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.410
I lived in South Central.

28:54.630 --> 28:57.320
South Central. And I hated it.

28:57.410 --> 28:58.670
That's why I moved to Oahu.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.060
Now I can name you
over 200 different kinds of fish.

29:01.190 --> 29:02.760
- No, you can't.
- Oh, yes, I can.

29:02.930 --> 29:04.320
- Do it.
- Yeah, you cannot.

29:04.410 --> 29:09.410
G. Ghost pipefish, grill fish, goaler fish
grouper fish, greenback...

29:09.630 --> 29:11.280
What's the state fish of Hawaii?

29:11.410 --> 29:12.980
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.

29:13.150 --> 29:14.850
- Yeah, bitch.
- Hey.

29:15.590 --> 29:18.200
- You ready?
- Yeah, just gonna close up.

29:21.110 --> 29:24.940
Hello, Mr Bretter, Mr Brayden.
Where's your wife, sir?

29:25.460 --> 29:27.770
She is in bed.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.850
How are things going with the lady?

29:29.940 --> 29:34.110
<i>Not awesome.
She's complicated, like The Da Vinci Code,</i>

29:34.980 --> 29:37.770
you know, but harder to crack.

29:39.120 --> 29:42.990
But life is full of lessons.
You learn something new every day.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.380
Wonder what I'm going to learn tomorrow.

29:48.810 --> 29:49.990
Well.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.950
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.210
Good night, sir.

29:53.340 --> 29:56.030
Off to find the mythical clitoris.

29:57.300 --> 30:02.600
So, Peter, were you able to get
that crying lady out of your room?

30:03.860 --> 30:05.300
'Cause I could send someone up,
if you want.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.170
- Oh, you could?
- Yeah.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.730
That's very funny. It is.

30:11.860 --> 30:16.040
Well, listen, Sarah Marshall Show sucks.
Who cares?

30:16.170 --> 30:18.780
I do the music for that programme.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.520
Did I mention that the music rocks?

30:24.080 --> 30:27.740
That's very sweet of you.
That's very sweet of you to say.

30:27.830 --> 30:29.910
You don't have to say that, though.
It's not music.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.610
There's no melody, it's just tones.

30:32.740 --> 30:34.830
Just dark, ominous tones.

30:36.610 --> 30:39.700
"The masturbating dog killer
is on the loose again.

30:39.830 --> 30:42.520
"He'll kill the owner,
but at least the dogs are happy."

30:49.530 --> 30:52.140
I'm no Aldous Snow, I guess, you know.

30:57.010 --> 30:59.750
<i>Time to start the music</i>

31:00.140 --> 31:02.050
<i>All gonna light the light</i>

31:02.660 --> 31:06.620
<i>Yeah, yeah, gonna get things started
on The Muppet Show tonight</i>

31:14.320 --> 31:16.930
- Whipped cream or berry?
- Whipped cream.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.930
Here we are, sir. Have
a wonderful breakfast.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.750
What a lovely table, so
close to the buffet.

31:24.880 --> 31:27.280
<i>I'm glad you like it. Mahalo.</i>

31:31.230 --> 31:33.020
Good morning, sir.
Can I start you with anything?

31:33.100 --> 31:34.370
Orange juice, coffee?

31:34.450 --> 31:37.890
What about, like, some pineapple juice
with a little bit of rum on the side.

31:38.020 --> 31:41.850
Of course. I like your style. Cocktail guy.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.930
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

31:44.150 --> 31:46.020
We've already reserved
the sea kayak for noon.

31:46.150 --> 31:49.060
Honey, I know that,
but you know that I wanted to see...

31:49.150 --> 31:52.720
- Hey. Hello there, friend.
- Hey.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.200
How are you guys? How was your evening?

31:55.330 --> 31:56.680
- Great.
- Awesome.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.500
- I can't feel anything.
- All right.

32:00.020 --> 32:02.420
- Does that feel good?
- I still can't feel anything.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.720
Okay, 'cause it hurts me.

32:04.810 --> 32:07.640
- Would you do that for me?
- Yeah.

32:08.550 --> 32:12.330
- Yeah.
- No, no, no. No.

32:12.850 --> 32:15.770
God put our mouths on our head
for a reason. No!

32:18.250 --> 32:20.640
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

32:21.680 --> 32:26.600
- Is everything okay with...
- Waffles.

32:30.160 --> 32:33.470
- Here you go, sir. Breakfast of champions.
- Oh, thank you.

32:33.600 --> 32:38.170
And don't tell anybody, but...
A little extra love for you.

32:39.950 --> 32:41.080
Thank you.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.600
- Take it easy.
- You, too.

32:56.210 --> 32:58.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:58.170 --> 32:59.560
This is the yoga place, yeah?

32:59.650 --> 33:03.000
Yes. But there's no alcohol allowed
in the studio.

33:03.740 --> 33:07.870
Oh, no, I mean, obviously.
This is just pineapple juice.

33:09.130 --> 33:12.570
Well, there's no outside drinks
allowed in the studio.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.870
- Can I set it down?
- Sure.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.260
- Cool, thank you.
- I like your hat.

33:17.390 --> 33:20.520
- Thank you.
- Please remove it before class.

33:23.220 --> 33:26.350
Hey, everyone,
why don't you all grab your mats?

33:28.310 --> 33:32.480
<i>Sorry, I recognise you from the cover
of Namaste Magazine. I'm a huge fan.</i>

33:32.790 --> 33:35.010
Thank you. That's so sweet of you to say.

33:35.220 --> 33:38.880
I appreciate that.
Obviously, I don't do yoga for recognition.

33:39.050 --> 33:42.920
Right, of course you wouldn't.
Then stop being so good at it.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.310
That's very flexible. That's nice.

33:49.490 --> 33:52.710
- And, you, I recognise you from your show.
- Thank you.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.230
You seem much taller on your show.

33:56.190 --> 33:58.360
- I'm not.
- No, I know.

34:00.540 --> 34:03.880
Okay, if you just wanna start
by bringing your palms into your chest.

34:04.100 --> 34:07.840
Today we're gonna start with
the Surya Namaskar, or Sun Salutation.

34:07.930 --> 34:10.150
Let's take a deep inale in.

34:10.670 --> 34:12.760
Exhale and release the hands.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.670
Inale, arms up to the sky. Continue.

34:16.710 --> 34:19.630
Good, exhale and folding forward.

34:20.370 --> 34:24.540
Strong, strong backs. Good, excellent.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.409
Remember this is not a competition,

34:26.630 --> 34:28.889
although you two seem
to be the best in the class.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.500
Excellent. Perfect form, you two, perfect.

34:31.630 --> 34:34.330
Coming up into downward-facing dog.

34:34.940 --> 34:37.150
Good. It's really important in this pose,

34:37.370 --> 34:40.590
that you arch your back
and keep it flat at the same time.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.199
I feel like those are opposing ideas.

34:43.420 --> 34:47.590
No, they're not, 'cause you're arching
your back up while it's flat.

34:47.679 --> 34:48.810
Okay.

34:51.330 --> 34:55.510
Good, yeah, sweat it out.
Sweat out all the toxins from this morning.

34:55.810 --> 34:57.990
- Come on, lady.
- My name is Prana,

34:58.120 --> 35:00.380
and I know that wasn't just juice.

35:00.600 --> 35:05.080
You don't really need any adjusting,
so I'm just gonna do this for myself.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.810
Just to learn from your body,

35:08.120 --> 35:09.770
memorize your body.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.210
- Good. Strong legs.
- Come on.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.170
Perfect skin and form.

35:17.080 --> 35:20.120
Okay, class, I'd like to now
move into a tripod headstand.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.990
This is more of an advanced pose,

35:22.210 --> 35:24.910
so if you don't feel comfortable
or strong enough,

35:24.990 --> 35:28.780
please feel free to just lay on your mat
in child's pose.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.130
I got it.

35:30.340 --> 35:33.340
All right, so let's all
come down to our mats.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.690
Get in a prep position
for the tripod headstand.

35:36.780 --> 35:37.820
If you don't feel comfortable,

35:38.040 --> 35:41.170
there's no shame
in just laying on your mat in child's pose.

35:41.260 --> 35:42.740
Lady, I got it.

35:42.830 --> 35:45.740
Good, so let's prep to come up. Good.

35:47.220 --> 35:50.260
Sir, if you just want to lay down
in child's pose.

35:50.350 --> 35:51.390
Now, you all heard me say,

35:51.480 --> 35:54.520
"If you want to be in child's pose,
that's okay."

35:54.610 --> 35:56.700
- Just in case he gets hurt.
- Bring it, bring it.

35:56.830 --> 35:59.000
I don't want you to break your neck.

35:59.220 --> 36:00.660
- What's up?
- Just relax.

36:00.870 --> 36:02.740
My legs, that's what.

36:02.870 --> 36:05.050
We're doing quiet headstands today.

36:05.140 --> 36:08.090
I'm doing a handstand, motherfucker!
I'm doing a handstand.

36:08.180 --> 36:09.830
Okay, you know, why don't we just release.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.180
Thank God.

36:11.620 --> 36:14.140
Good, everybody. Good.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.530
Hey.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.310
Are you Chuck?

36:21.400 --> 36:24.750
Oh, man, you know,
they won't change that flyer.

36:25.050 --> 36:28.400
That's my mainland name.
My Hawaiian name is Koonu.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.060
Cool, sorry.

36:30.270 --> 36:31.450
No, it's all good.

36:31.530 --> 36:34.580
Does Koonu have some, like,
cool Hawaiian meaning?

36:34.670 --> 36:36.540
It means Chuck.

36:36.620 --> 36:38.100
I plugged it into a database.

36:38.320 --> 36:41.450
There's a thing you can go on, on the
Internet, you just type in your name,

36:41.670 --> 36:42.710
and it just says it.

36:44.750 --> 36:45.710
What's your name?

36:45.930 --> 36:47.060
- I'm Peter.
- Peter.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.840
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna give you a Hawaiian name.

36:48.930 --> 36:50.190
Oh, great.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.110
Pepiopi.

36:57.410 --> 36:59.590
- Great.
- Pepiopi, looks like you've got a little pain

36:59.800 --> 37:01.540
behind those eyes.

37:03.110 --> 37:04.890
Yeah, maybe a little.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.800
There's really only one cure for that.

37:07.940 --> 37:08.980
What's that?

37:09.070 --> 37:10.720
Weed. You got any?

37:13.020 --> 37:15.420
- No.
- Well, then let's go surfing.

37:18.550 --> 37:21.680
Okay, when we're out there,
I want you to ignore your instincts.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.940
I'm gonna be your instincts.
Koonu will be your instincts.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.510
Don't do anything.

37:26.590 --> 37:28.980
Don't try to surf, don't do it.

37:29.940 --> 37:32.120
The less you do, the more you do.

37:32.330 --> 37:34.640
Let's see you pop up. Pop it up!

37:38.680 --> 37:39.810
That's not it at all.

37:39.940 --> 37:41.380
Do less. Get down. Try less. Do it again.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.820
Pop up.

37:45.550 --> 37:47.250
No, too slow. Do less.

37:47.340 --> 37:48.470
Pop up.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.160
Pop up.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.560
You're doing too much. Do less. Pop down.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.820
Pop up now.

37:53.990 --> 37:55.250
Stop! Get down. Get down there.

37:55.470 --> 37:57.560
Remember, don't do anything.

37:58.300 --> 37:59.860
Nothing. Pop up.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.120
Well, you... No, you
gotta do more than that,

38:04.210 --> 38:05.390
'cause you're just laying right out.

38:05.470 --> 38:06.520
It looks like you're boogie-boarding.

38:06.650 --> 38:08.730
Just do it. Feel it. Pop up.

38:10.390 --> 38:13.300
Yeah. That wasn't quite it,
but we're gonna figure it out, out there.

38:13.390 --> 38:14.430
Let's go surfing, come on.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.520
Everybody's learning how, come on and...

38:16.650 --> 38:18.950
<i>The weather outside is weather</i>

38:20.610 --> 38:22.700
How long you lived out here?

38:22.780 --> 38:25.700
Man, I don't know. I quit wearing a watch
when I moved out here.

38:25.830 --> 38:28.220
- Wow, that's so cool.
- Yeah.

38:28.300 --> 38:32.390
No, like my cell phone has a clock on it,
so I don't really need it.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.220
Right, so it's basically the same thing.

38:35.830 --> 38:39.050
- How old are you?
- I don't really believe in age or numbers,

38:39.180 --> 38:41.960
you know, I don't...
I mean, if you had to put a number on it,

38:42.090 --> 38:44.480
I guess I'd be 44.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.010
Fuck!

38:48.750 --> 38:51.050
Thanks for taking me out here.

38:52.180 --> 38:55.090
This is the first time I've felt good
in three weeks or so.

38:55.310 --> 38:57.920
You need to get back on that board
is what you need to do.

38:58.050 --> 38:59.920
- Yeah?
- Hey, here's the deal.

39:00.010 --> 39:01.360
When life gives you lemons,

39:01.580 --> 39:03.750
just say, "Fuck the lemons," and bail.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.580
Yeah. No. You said it, totally.

39:06.710 --> 39:08.660
You gotta just pull yourself up
by your wetsuit,

39:08.880 --> 39:09.840
get back on that board...

39:10.010 --> 39:11.490
Hey, look, man,
if you're attacked by a shark,

39:11.710 --> 39:13.140
are you gonna give up surfing?

39:13.270 --> 39:14.930
Probably, yeah.

39:15.010 --> 39:17.750
Let's go in, all right. Tacos are on me.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.750
Can you try to listen
to what I'm saying to you, Brian?

39:20.970 --> 39:23.490
I'm confused and I don't know what to do.

39:23.580 --> 39:24.840
<i>What's up with that hat?</i>

39:25.060 --> 39:27.670
<i>What are you
in the Buena Vista Social Club?</i>

39:27.760 --> 39:28.890
This is a nice hat.

39:29.020 --> 39:31.710
<i>What member of the Brat Pack are you?</i>

39:31.930 --> 39:34.850
<i>You look like one of those guys
suspected of killing JFK.</i>

39:34.930 --> 39:37.240
That's very funny. That's great.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.320
<i>Tell him to make friends.</i>

39:39.630 --> 39:41.930
<i>You need to get out there
and make some friends, man.</i>

39:42.150 --> 39:43.590
Is Liz there right now?

39:43.800 --> 39:45.890
<i>No, no, she's not in here, buddy.</i>

39:45.980 --> 39:47.020
I just heard her.

39:47.240 --> 39:48.590
<i>She's gone.</i>

39:49.240 --> 39:51.110
Who are you looking at?

39:51.330 --> 39:52.370
<i>What?</i>

39:52.460 --> 39:54.150
Is she still... Hi, Liz.

39:54.240 --> 39:58.110
<i>No. I swear on my mother's grave, it...
Okay, it was Liz.</i>

39:58.420 --> 40:00.370
<i>She wasn't here the entire time.</i>

40:00.500 --> 40:02.680
<i>Go out and meet people.
We meet people all the time...</i>

40:02.810 --> 40:04.240
<i>- All the time on vacation.
- Constantly.</i>

40:04.330 --> 40:07.290
I've tried, all right,
there's a couple of dudes here,

40:07.460 --> 40:09.550
but they're kind of weird.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.770
<i>Just be friendly.</i>

40:11.860 --> 40:12.990
<i>Iron your shirt.</i>

40:13.120 --> 40:14.460
<i>Iron your shirt, look sharp.</i>

40:14.680 --> 40:16.250
<i>Even your T-shirts.</i>

40:16.770 --> 40:19.380
There is this girl at the front desk
who's pretty cute.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.900
<i>Oh, yeah. You know what?
Go have another dirty one night stand.</i>

40:23.030 --> 40:24.770
<i>That worked out so well before.</i>

40:24.900 --> 40:27.820
What do you want from me?
You just told me I need to meet people.

40:27.900 --> 40:30.430
<i>Ask her out.
Maybe that's what he needs, is a rebound.</i>

40:30.510 --> 40:32.380
<i>He's had plenty of chances
for rebounds. This isn't...</i>

40:32.600 --> 40:33.640
<i>Can we get on the same team here?</i>

40:33.860 --> 40:36.910
<i>Okay, I'm sorry.
We're on the same team. Sorry.</i>

40:38.120 --> 40:39.910
<i>You should go on a date with this girl.</i>

40:39.990 --> 40:41.260
Well, maybe I'll ask her out then.

40:41.470 --> 40:43.340
<i>- Yes.
- My wife says so.</i>

40:43.780 --> 40:46.600
<i>- Hey, I'm in Hawaii, too!
Oh, that's neat.</i>

40:47.000 --> 40:48.780
<i>Aloha, bitches!</i>

40:49.820 --> 40:51.390
That's very cool.

40:54.610 --> 40:57.130
They're not Native Americans, Brian.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.650
<i>- Bri...
- What are you doing?</i>

41:00.870 --> 41:02.870
<i>- The luha. Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

41:03.170 --> 41:04.300
<i>It's called the hula.</i>

41:04.520 --> 41:06.180
<i>- Luau?
- No, hula.</i>

41:06.390 --> 41:07.350
<i>You're doing a luau?</i>

41:21.920 --> 41:22.960
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:23.090 --> 41:24.220
- Peter.
- Wow.

41:25.790 --> 41:28.830
You look beautiful.
I mean, that's a beautiful dress.

41:29.010 --> 41:29.960
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

41:30.180 --> 41:31.400
This'll be fun.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.790
<i>Lei?</i>

41:37.490 --> 41:40.180
May I help you with something else, Peter?

41:40.490 --> 41:42.490
No, I'll just grab a drink.
I'm just gonna head inside.

41:42.580 --> 41:44.970
- Happy 4th of July!
- Thank you.

41:47.360 --> 41:48.320
<i>Aloha!</i>

42:02.190 --> 42:04.060
- You done here?
- No, actually, I just sat down,

42:04.280 --> 42:06.020
I'm just getting started.
It's delicious, though, thank you.

42:06.230 --> 42:08.230
I'll just go fuck myself.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.110
<i>- Sorry, what?
- Mahalo.</i>

42:13.150 --> 42:14.370
Hi, Peter.

42:16.240 --> 42:17.800
Hey. Hey, bro.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.280
- Hi.
- Hey, all right.

42:21.460 --> 42:23.240
Excuse me. Excuse me.

42:23.330 --> 42:26.460
Everybody, can I have your attention
for one second, please.

42:26.590 --> 42:29.500
We have a very special guest
with us here, today.

42:29.590 --> 42:33.760
He is the lead singer
of the band, Infant Sorrow,

42:34.590 --> 42:38.160
one of my favourite musicians of all time.
He's so awesome.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.370
Please, please, let's take...

42:41.900 --> 42:46.070
Let's see if we can get him up here,
Mr Aldous Snow. Please, come on.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.160
Share your gift.

42:48.290 --> 42:49.510
Duty calls and all that.

42:49.640 --> 42:53.380
I'm trying to be incognito, it's weird.
It's like work to me, this is no fun.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.160
Hey! Thank you!

43:03.900 --> 43:06.290
Thank you.
What a lovely introduction.

43:06.510 --> 43:08.900
What an eccentric and confident young man.

43:09.030 --> 43:12.470
I'd like to dedicate this song to a
very beautiful woman that's here today.

43:12.690 --> 43:15.380
It's Miss Sarah Marshall, there she is.

43:16.300 --> 43:17.470
Look at her, blimey!

43:25.910 --> 43:28.300
<i>Old as ancient skies</i>

43:28.600 --> 43:31.210
<i>I've had these wandering eyes</i>

43:32.040 --> 43:34.350
<i>but you took me by surprise</i>

43:34.480 --> 43:36.870
<i>when you let me inside you</i>

43:38.830 --> 43:40.520
<i>Inside you</i>

43:41.220 --> 43:43.300
<i>Inside you</i>

43:43.650 --> 43:45.090
This went from 6:00 to midnight.

43:45.220 --> 43:49.350
<i>Teach me how to grow
while I'm moving inside of you</i>

43:51.350 --> 43:53.130
<i>Inside of you</i>

43:54.050 --> 43:56.350
<i>- Inside you
- Inside you</i>

43:57.610 --> 44:00.440
<i>I long to be, is it wrong to be</i>

44:00.530 --> 44:02.830
<i>inside of you</i>

44:03.750 --> 44:07.920
<i>Inside of you the restless
find their dreams</i>

44:10.010 --> 44:13.880
<i>Inside of you this king has found his queen</i>

44:20.530 --> 44:21.580
Hey.

44:21.710 --> 44:22.840
You're from the breakfast buffet, right?

44:23.050 --> 44:23.970
- Yeah.
- Whipped cream or berries?

44:24.100 --> 44:25.140
Yeah. Yeah, I'm Peter.

44:27.230 --> 44:28.060
- Kemo.
- Kemo.

44:28.140 --> 44:30.360
- Good to meet you, man.
- Good to meet, you, man.

44:30.580 --> 44:32.840
- Have a beer.
- Thanks. Thank you.

44:35.360 --> 44:36.800
Sarah Marshall.

44:36.930 --> 44:37.970
Yes.

44:39.620 --> 44:41.630
How do you know
I was dating Sarah Marshall?

44:41.710 --> 44:44.230
Dwayne told me. Chuck told me.

44:45.060 --> 44:46.190
Even Rachel told me.

44:46.410 --> 44:50.370
I heard about it from everybody.
You gotta stop talking about it.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.890
<i>It's like The Sopranos.</i>

44:53.060 --> 44:54.320
It's over.

44:54.980 --> 44:56.630
Find a new show.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.760
You need a hug.

45:00.060 --> 45:01.540
Come here.

45:03.280 --> 45:04.760
Oh, thank you.

45:04.850 --> 45:06.630
You're awfully nice.

45:07.890 --> 45:10.590
<i>I gotta go.
I'm prepping the pig for tomorrow's luau.</i>

45:10.720 --> 45:13.420
You should come and help me.
It'll take your mind off of things.

45:13.630 --> 45:15.500
- Yeah? You don't mind?
- No.

45:16.030 --> 45:18.720
I mean, I must say I'm a pretty good cook.

45:19.160 --> 45:20.420
All right!

45:23.640 --> 45:26.330
I can't! Please don't make me do this!

45:26.550 --> 45:27.590
Do it!

45:27.680 --> 45:30.200
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

45:34.990 --> 45:36.550
You can stop crying now.

45:36.770 --> 45:38.340
He's dead already.

45:38.860 --> 45:40.340
I'm not crying.

45:40.420 --> 45:41.680
You should stop crying.

45:41.900 --> 45:43.420
I don't cry. I'm not a baby.

45:43.560 --> 45:46.470
Really?
'Cause you look like a gigantic baby.

45:46.770 --> 45:49.380
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that at all.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.340
Hey.

46:00.560 --> 46:05.040
Listen, would you like to hang out tonight,
like, not in an official hotel function?

46:05.130 --> 46:06.390
Yeah. Totally.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.080
A bunch of us are going to go to this,
like, little beach thing afterwards.

46:09.210 --> 46:11.480
You're totally welcome to come.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.690
Maybe we could go together?

46:13.910 --> 46:15.350
Yeah, whatever.

46:15.780 --> 46:17.000
I mean we don't have to,
if you don't want to,

46:17.220 --> 46:18.170
I just thought that maybe...

46:18.260 --> 46:19.740
No, listen,
you don't have to make this weird.

46:19.830 --> 46:21.610
You either want to go or you don't.

46:23.170 --> 46:24.830
- I would love to.
- Okay.

46:25.480 --> 46:28.090
Awesome. Why don't you go upstairs,
change that shirt,

46:28.260 --> 46:31.000
and I'll meet you out front in, like, five?

46:41.090 --> 46:44.220
- This is so cool.
- You like it?

46:57.180 --> 46:59.450
So what brought you to Hawaii?

47:00.790 --> 47:03.100
- A dude.
- Of course.

47:03.230 --> 47:06.450
A surfer dude. You know, WCT, top 44.

47:09.800 --> 47:10.930
Totally.

47:12.710 --> 47:15.100
We were together for two years.

47:15.410 --> 47:18.100
Dropped out of school,
moved out here with him.

47:18.230 --> 47:20.320
Three weeks later,
I caught him cheating on me,

47:20.540 --> 47:22.800
so I moved out, and that's that.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.410
What an asshole.

47:26.370 --> 47:27.930
No, he's just a boy.

47:30.410 --> 47:34.280
You ever think about going back home,
finishing school, or...

47:35.630 --> 47:36.590
No.

47:37.410 --> 47:39.410
No. I work at the hotel,

47:40.460 --> 47:43.150
doesn't really have to
be a future in there.

47:44.500 --> 47:45.980
Okay, my turn.

47:46.370 --> 47:47.550
Okay.

47:48.370 --> 47:52.550
So, how do you like
writing music for a TV show?

47:55.550 --> 47:57.850
It's great, you know. People are great.

47:57.940 --> 48:00.980
It's great to have a steady paycheque.
It's... I'm very lucky.

48:01.070 --> 48:02.110
Oh, my God, you hate it.

48:02.330 --> 48:04.510
I fucking hate it so much.

48:04.850 --> 48:07.120
So then, do something about it.

48:10.900 --> 48:11.810
Excuse me.

48:12.030 --> 48:15.160
I'm just saying, if you hate something,
change it.

48:15.250 --> 48:16.950
- Don't dwell.
- Well, I'm trying.

48:19.030 --> 48:21.640
I'm actually working on a rock opera.

48:22.690 --> 48:24.120
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:25.470 --> 48:27.690
What's your rock opera about?

48:30.170 --> 48:31.430
Dracula.

48:32.910 --> 48:35.690
Yeah, and eternal love, you know.
That's the theme.

48:35.820 --> 48:39.260
But I think the two sort of
go hand in hand, you know?

48:39.780 --> 48:41.040
And I...

48:43.130 --> 48:46.130
I have this vision of
doing it with puppets.

48:48.950 --> 48:50.740
I mean, humans also, you know.

48:53.220 --> 48:54.560
Why Dracula?

48:54.690 --> 48:58.440
Because he's a man like anyone else.
He just wants to be loved.

48:58.650 --> 49:00.300
And every time he gets close
to a human woman,

49:00.520 --> 49:02.090
he ends up smothering and killing her,

49:02.180 --> 49:04.780
which is a feeling I am familiar with.

49:04.910 --> 49:06.790
What? That's just a joke.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.740
- Oh, shit.
- What?

49:09.610 --> 49:12.610
My ex. If I run, you run.

49:14.180 --> 49:15.960
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand at all.

49:16.180 --> 49:17.920
Fucking motherfucker! Dipshit!

49:18.050 --> 49:18.960
Rachel, what are you doing?

49:19.180 --> 49:20.830
I thought I told you
to stay back on your island.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.010
Take it easy, just take it easy.

49:22.090 --> 49:23.270
Yeah, you know what?
The deal was over April 9.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.530
Well, the deal's back on, motherfucker.

49:25.660 --> 49:27.530
You ain't the chief in this village.
I'm the chief.

49:27.750 --> 49:28.790
Of the idiots?

49:28.880 --> 49:31.570
Rachel, let me handle this. I know his
friend. Let me handle this, okay?

49:31.710 --> 49:33.140
Go ahead.

49:34.010 --> 49:35.970
Hey, man, you remember me from breakfast?

49:36.180 --> 49:38.790
- Oh, yeah, the cocktail guy, that's right.
- Yeah.

49:38.880 --> 49:42.010
This ain't the breakfast buffet.
What, you with my girl?

49:42.140 --> 49:44.230
Keeping her warm for me at night, huh?

49:44.400 --> 49:46.400
Hey, what are you doing here?

49:50.450 --> 49:51.930
That's right. Just hit him!

49:52.010 --> 49:53.280
Rachel, we gotta get out of here. Rachel?

49:53.410 --> 49:55.450
You get what you deserve.

50:07.450 --> 50:11.020
Just a boy?
No, that dude was a fucking man.

50:11.240 --> 50:15.060
No, no, no. He's an asshole.
I can't believe I ever dated him.

50:16.020 --> 50:17.800
- You went nuts.
- Yeah.

50:18.330 --> 50:20.800
You guys are dysfunctional.

50:21.410 --> 50:23.850
<i>You were like one of those girls
from Flavour of Love.</i>

50:23.940 --> 50:25.280
- From what?
- You were.

50:25.420 --> 50:27.290
"I'll kill you. I'll kill you."

50:28.630 --> 50:30.500
Okay, I'm gonna go get us another round.

50:30.590 --> 50:32.590
I'll grab it. It's no big deal.

50:32.680 --> 50:36.330
You don't have to dote on me.
I'm not that type of girl.

50:49.160 --> 50:50.730
You look so hot.

50:50.860 --> 50:53.120
<i>Give me Crime Scene.
Give me dirty Crime Scene girl.</i>

50:53.340 --> 50:55.420
André the Giant, out of the shot, please.

50:55.510 --> 50:57.510
Mutombo, out of the shot, come on.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.300
Did you know that there's a picture
of you flashing,

51:29.430 --> 51:30.870
hanging in the men's room?

51:31.090 --> 51:34.000
Yeah. I hate it so much.

51:34.130 --> 51:36.740
My jackass boyfriend made me do it.

51:37.350 --> 51:39.220
Keoki took it, right there.

51:39.310 --> 51:41.390
And I asked him to take it down,

51:41.520 --> 51:44.960
but he said that it would ruin
the balance of the collage.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.570
Do you want me to try
to get it down for you?

51:47.790 --> 51:51.440
No. No, no, no, he'll kill you.
Like, really kill you.

51:53.400 --> 51:55.700
But I have a surprise for you.

51:56.220 --> 51:57.480
Really, what?

51:57.570 --> 51:58.830
We're gonna take a quick break.

51:59.050 --> 52:01.010
Tonight we have a special guest
from the mainland,

52:01.140 --> 52:03.920
singing a song from his Dracula musical,

52:04.270 --> 52:07.270
please welcome to the stage,
Mr Peter Bretter.

52:09.140 --> 52:10.310
Peter!

52:10.400 --> 52:12.050
Yeah! Go get them, tiger!

52:12.180 --> 52:13.100
Please don't.

52:14.440 --> 52:15.710
Peter!

52:16.010 --> 52:18.450
- Rachel...
- Dracula! Peter!

52:23.840 --> 52:25.100
Get them!

52:25.320 --> 52:26.230
What's up?

52:32.930 --> 52:34.280
Thank you.

52:37.100 --> 52:38.540
You know, I could play something else.

52:38.670 --> 52:40.100
I just think out of
context this might be...

52:40.320 --> 52:41.890
Dracula musical!

52:43.890 --> 52:45.240
Thank you.

53:05.460 --> 53:09.940
<i>It's getting kind of hard to believe
things are going to get better</i>

53:12.240 --> 53:17.980
<i>I've been drowning too long to believe
that the tide's going to turn</i>

53:19.720 --> 53:24.860
<i>And I've been living too hard to believe
things are going to get easier now</i>

53:27.030 --> 53:31.640
<i>I'm still trying to shake off the pain
from the lessons I've learned</i>

53:34.250 --> 53:39.030
<i>And if I see Van Helsing, I swear
to the lord I will slay him</i>

53:41.430 --> 53:45.600
<i>Take it from me, but I swear
I won't let it be so</i>

53:48.120 --> 53:52.990
<i>Blood will run down his face
when he is decapitated</i>

53:54.470 --> 53:58.300
<i>His head on my mantle
is how I will let this one know</i>

53:59.780 --> 54:01.560
<i>How much I love you</i>

54:09.260 --> 54:10.430
<i>Die</i>

54:11.350 --> 54:12.390
<i>Die</i>

54:13.570 --> 54:14.610
<i>Die</i>

54:19.180 --> 54:20.310
<i>I can't</i>

54:31.920 --> 54:33.270
Awesome!

54:33.790 --> 54:35.220
Thank you.

54:39.180 --> 54:40.140
Thank you.

54:40.570 --> 54:43.570
So, I had a really, really
great time tonight.

54:43.660 --> 54:45.750
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I mean, it got a little wild.

54:45.960 --> 54:47.840
- "A little"? You can say that.
- Yeah.

54:47.970 --> 54:50.660
But it was really fun,
and you're so cool, and it was...

54:50.750 --> 54:52.450
Thank you for taking me out.

54:52.530 --> 54:54.230
No, I had a great time. Thank you.

54:55.970 --> 54:57.530
- You did?
- Yeah.

55:01.710 --> 55:03.800
I'm sorry.

55:03.930 --> 55:08.060
I'm sorry, I just... I don't...
I just don't wanna complicate things.

55:08.190 --> 55:09.540
- No, of course!
- Yeah?

55:09.620 --> 55:12.760
No, no, no. Totally. I totally get that.

55:12.970 --> 55:15.060
- I had a great time.
- A handshake?

55:15.190 --> 55:18.410
- Well, I don't know. Okay.
- All right, all right.

55:18.500 --> 55:21.110
- All right. Get home safe.
- You, too.

55:24.240 --> 55:26.240
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

55:33.500 --> 55:37.070
<i>I'm on a hammock with me lady</i>

55:37.280 --> 55:40.630
<i>Watching the sea roll by</i>

55:42.890 --> 55:45.500
<i>Things have been great now</i>

55:45.630 --> 55:48.850
<i>'Cause we're in Hawaii</i>

55:50.720 --> 55:52.200
Hey, guys.

55:53.330 --> 55:55.510
Hey, man. I'm Koonu.

55:56.380 --> 55:59.590
Yeah. No, I remember. I'm Peter.
We took a surf lesson together.

55:59.680 --> 56:03.120
Yeah, you're that guy
that works with Kaiser Permanente.

56:03.250 --> 56:06.770
No, I'm Peter.
We had a nice talk out on the water.

56:06.900 --> 56:08.340
That's cool.

56:10.550 --> 56:12.510
Okay, can I just say something?

56:12.640 --> 56:16.080
- I went on a date tonight with Rachel, right?
- That wasn't a date.

56:16.160 --> 56:18.160
She's in customer service, dude.

56:18.250 --> 56:20.250
She took you out for charity.

56:20.430 --> 56:24.600
It was a date, okay? Trust me.
I know a date, and that was a date.

56:24.820 --> 56:25.950
I bet you think strippers like you, too.

56:26.080 --> 56:27.120
- That's really not necessary.
- It's true.

56:29.080 --> 56:32.130
Don't waste your time, man.
Believe me, it is a nowhere road. I know.

56:32.210 --> 56:35.130
Did you see her ex-boyfriend?
He is ridiculous.

56:35.260 --> 56:37.430
Who, Greg? I love Greg, man.

56:37.650 --> 56:40.260
I saw him beat up a guy with a starfish.

56:40.480 --> 56:43.480
- Okay, that's just ridiculous.
- That guy was me.

56:43.610 --> 56:46.390
Dude, my homie over here,
on his honeymoon?

56:46.610 --> 56:49.130
Getting as much sex
as he possibly can ever have.

56:49.220 --> 56:51.000
Are you giving to her
hard and rough, dude?

56:51.090 --> 56:52.560
Come on.

56:53.910 --> 56:59.740
The wife wants me to do certain things
that I find inappropriate.

56:59.960 --> 57:02.790
Let me just say
that if God was a city planner,

57:02.870 --> 57:06.660
he would not put a playground
next to a sewage system.

57:08.920 --> 57:13.010
We're trying to fuck,
but we're not having fun fucking.

57:13.090 --> 57:17.050
We're just, like...
I'm stabbing her private parts,

57:19.660 --> 57:23.100
and it's not fun, and it causes anxiety.
Fucking is...

57:23.310 --> 57:24.880
And then when you're not fucking...

57:25.010 --> 57:27.710
- Hey, someone's gotta stop him.
- You're the butt of a joke.

57:27.790 --> 57:30.180
Fucking this ring is...

57:30.400 --> 57:31.970
Fuck!

57:32.100 --> 57:34.180
It's gonna be all right.

57:35.930 --> 57:37.190
Hi.

57:38.750 --> 57:41.140
Hi, do you wanna come back to bed?

57:41.270 --> 57:42.400
Sure.

57:45.410 --> 57:46.670
Have fun.

57:48.230 --> 57:52.410
I like her hair.
I wonder if the carpet matches her pubes.

58:00.450 --> 58:02.190
Julian, what's up?

58:04.630 --> 58:05.540
Oh.

58:06.590 --> 58:07.850
God.

58:18.070 --> 58:19.850
The show's been cancelled.

58:20.020 --> 58:21.810
That's good, 'cause that's what you wanted.

58:21.940 --> 58:24.420
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

58:25.770 --> 58:30.900
It's just... I guess
I thought we had another year left.

58:30.980 --> 58:33.070
It seems like we did, and...
This'll be good,

58:33.290 --> 58:36.420
'cause it's been a long-awaited transition
into film for me.

58:36.510 --> 58:39.770
Don't get me wrong, but it's just...
It's a surprise.

58:39.860 --> 58:41.510
Come on tour with me.

58:41.640 --> 58:46.420
I'll serenade you every night
in front of thousands of women.

58:46.510 --> 58:48.210
I didn't know you were going on tour.

58:48.420 --> 58:49.550
Yeah, I'm going in two weeks.

58:49.640 --> 58:53.730
It's like an 18-month tour,
43 countries, Infant Sorrow,

58:53.820 --> 58:55.900
and it's gonna be a massive tour.

58:56.030 --> 59:01.120
Yeah. I can't come 'cause I have a job.
I'm a working actress.

59:01.250 --> 59:02.990
Not any more.

59:03.120 --> 59:04.340
You're an unemployed actress, perfect.

59:06.040 --> 59:10.210
You could be the queen of the groupies,
queen of the Sorrow Suckers.

59:10.520 --> 59:12.820
The Sorrow Suckers.

59:12.910 --> 59:16.340
Sorrow Suckers.
I don't know why they call them that.

59:16.560 --> 59:19.690
Mr and Mrs Snow, sorry.
Sorry to bother you.

59:21.350 --> 59:23.130
The hotel wanted to offer you
some complimentary coconut cake.

59:23.210 --> 59:27.300
It's from the hotel. It's definitely
not from me personally, so...

59:28.560 --> 59:30.650
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay, great.

59:30.740 --> 59:34.090
When were you planning on telling me this?

59:34.170 --> 59:37.740
- I just told you, then.
- Yeah. No, I know.

59:37.920 --> 59:42.610
But telling me now
isn't really the same as telling me.

59:42.830 --> 59:45.440
Well, look, you know,
I've not told you I've got genital herpes,

59:45.660 --> 59:47.960
because it's not inflamed at the moment.

59:48.050 --> 59:50.050
Do you guys want some champagne
with your cake,

59:50.140 --> 59:51.480
or do you want it without your cake?

59:51.610 --> 59:53.180
I don't drink.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:04.840
All right, so I came here
to give you my demo. I just...

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.450
I worship you,
and I just wanted to give you my demo.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.660
Just take a listen and...

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:13.050
Okay.

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:16.529
'Cause you know what?
You don't wanna be the guy sitting there,

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.229
watching BBC, and saying,

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:22.969
"Oh, I saw that guy! He was my waiter,

01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:27.059
"and I totally dismissed him
like everyone else does in his life.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.929
"And I totally was wrong,

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:32.579
"because he's a major, major,
major influence on me now,

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.150
"and I feel terrible!"

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.580
That stupid English voice, was that me?

01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:43.850
Unfortunately, yes.

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:48.109
You're really gonna like it.

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.930
I'll listen to it when you've gone.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:59.890
Hey, look, just don't
tell anyone at the hotel.

01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:11.249
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:16.069
Peter, I got some really interesting news
this morning.

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:18.029
Aldous gave you gonorrhoea?

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:21.159
No. Why would I tell you that?

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.769
<i>Crime Scene was cancelled.</i>

01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:24.810
Whoa.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.900
Wow.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.640
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.599
I mean, I've been waiting
to take the next step,

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.509
you know, into features for a long time,
so it's a really good thing.

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:44.300
<i>This isn't The View. I mean, we can have
an honest talk about this if we want.</i>

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.129
I don't wanna step out of the spotlight
and then be forgotten.

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:51.819
I don't wanna disappear. I'm freaked out.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.429
I wanna be honest.
I'm really freaked out right now, okay?

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:58.479
Because, seemingly, the only actresses
that actually can survive

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.609
are the ones that show their cooter,
and, excuse me, but I refuse to do that.

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:02.999
I have a little dignity.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.089
And I don't have the frame to support
plastic surgery. I would tip over.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:08.519
And I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna exploit myself.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.700
Listen, you're gonna be fine.
You have a long career ahead of you.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.649
You've got, like, four
years until you're 30.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.390
It's gonna be fine.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.959
- How are you?
- I'm screwed.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.479
Frankly, I don't stand a chance.
No, I'll be fine.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.050
I've been quietly stealing money
from you for a long time.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.970
You're always good at cheering me up,
Pete, thank you.

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:43.970
<i>Die</i>

01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:45.920
<i>Die</i>

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.010
<i>Die</i>

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.490
<i>I can't</i>

01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:59.579
It's really good, Peter.
I just don't understand it. I don't.

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.929
I mean, just chalk it up to that. Please
don't play it again, 'cause I don't...

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:05.100
Just listen to it one more time and see...

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:08.230
Where's Aldous?

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.839
- Mr Snow, may I ask you a question?
- Okay.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.969
I want to please my wife here,
on our honeymoon,

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:17.239
but I don't know what I'm doing.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.889
You having difficulty sex-wise?

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:21.189
- Do you not know how to use this?
- I know how.

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:23.979
- Have you had sex before?
- We can't.

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.539
- Why?
- Our religion.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.109
Right, 'cause of God and everything?

01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:28.369
Hey, that's not gonna be a problem,

01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:30.669
because God should be present
in the bedroom.

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:33.279
Just tell me specifically
what I need to do.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.199
You need to penetrate deeply
and stimulate the clitoris simultaneously.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.069
That's what you gotta do.
That's what it's about.

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:40.589
If you can involve the anus in that,
then that's absolute perfection.

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:41.629
Got it.

01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:44.029
Explore her ears.

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:47.459
Find it in you to be a little more circly.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.589
You are a man.

01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:49.939
God's within you.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.419
I actually feel okay about it.

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.329
You know, I'm a little scared, but I'll
be all right. I'll get another job.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.029
<i>That's interesting, man.
You know what else is interesting?</i>

01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:59.989
<i>- What?
- Me on the moon.</i>

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:02.249
I just wanna talk to you about something.
Can you stop?

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.469
<i>- All right, I'm just gonna talk, and then...
- Air!</i>

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:06.949
There was this interesting moment
with Sarah.

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:10.379
<i>Whoa, what? I don't wanna hear about
your interesting moment with Sarah, Pete.</i>

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.159
Then who am I supposed to talk to
about this?

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.899
<i>Well, not me, because have I ever had an
interesting moment with an ex-girlfriend?</i>

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.509
<i>- Do you have an ex-girlfriend? No!
- No.</i>

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:19.780
<i>LIZ: No.</i>

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.169
I would really love to get
the woman's perspective on the matter.

01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:25.729
<i>- Really?
- No.</i>

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.519
But come on in and just sit down.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.209
<i>- Stay. You have to...
- Honey, no, no, the camera's right there.</i>

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:31.469
<i>No, I know,
but I just wanna tell him, though.</i>

01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:34.259
<i>- No, the camera...
- Think about how much she's hurt you.</i>

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.429
<i>- Hey, Liz?
- Yeah?</i>

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.819
I think you need to move just a tiny bit
further away from the microphone.

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:38.949
<i>- Just...
- No, closer.</i>

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:40.129
<i>- Now a little further.
- Okay.</i>

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:41.259
<i>- Closer.
- And then...</i>

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.520
<i>- And then a little further, and then closer.
- I don't know.</i>

01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:45.429
<i>- Keep your head down, though.
- I'm bad at this thing.</i>

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.089
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, closer. Further away.</i>

01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:49.999
<i>I know what you're doing.
That's not funny at all.</i>

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.040
<i>- You stop that.
- What?</i>

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.610
<i>- What's he doing?
- Come on. Yeah, yeah, real funny.</i>

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.439
Hey, that's a great necklace, Liz.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.519
<i>- Did you have that a second ago?
- Thank you!</i>

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.479
<i>That's gross!</i>

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.959
<i>- LIZ: I don't get it.
- Stop it.</i>

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.699
<i>- He's saying if I were to sperm on you...
- What?</i>

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:09.829
<i>...it would be a pearl necklace.
- Why?</i>

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:11.700
<i>- Real funny.
- Sorry.</i>

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:15.269
Hey, Dracula!

01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:18.490
"And when I see Van Helsing,
I swear to the Lord, I'll slay him."

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.099
That shit is funny, dude!

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.659
Hey, Pete.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.269
So I was gonna go over
to Lazy Joe's later tonight,

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:29.530
and I wanted to see
if you wanted to come and join.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.839
I think I'm confused,
because I thought last night...

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.839
Oh, my God. Dude, get out of your head.
It's really nice out here.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.539
Yeah, I bet it is.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.799
All right, yeah. You know what?

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.229
I could totally use a
friendly hangout, so...

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.409
All right.

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:46.969
I don't know if you want,
instead of Lazy Joe's,

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:48.929
I was thinking of going
to Laie Point right now.

01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:50.279
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.670
I heard that place was a pain in the ass.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.970
Okay.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.579
- Hey!
Yo, what's up, guys?

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.709
We're just going for a hike.

01:05:58.710 --> 01:06:01.539
No, you're not, you're going snorkelling.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.019
I think we're gonna go on a hike.

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:06.239
It is sea turtle fucking season, dude.
Let's go.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.679
They fuck for three hours, dude.
I mean, that's magical.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.539
- No, we're going on a hike.
- I think we'll go on a hike, yeah.

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:13.330
What? Your loss.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.550
Why won't anybody
go snorkelling with me?

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.900
How you doing back there?

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.419
Awesome.

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.769
I don't think I've ever been
this covered in sweat before.

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:32.939
It's like I have some sort of fever.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:37.120
I told you this was a pain in the ass.
Could've been at Lazy Joe's.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.899
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.769
Oh, shit.

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.420
- You good?
- No.

01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:48.249
Wow, we're really going
up to the edge of this, huh?

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:49.510
Look!

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:55.690
Wow, this is really beautiful.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:03.909
All right, so now that your show's done,
are you gonna finish the Dracula musical?

01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:05.990
It's not that easy, you know.

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:09.869
Sarah always thought it was crazy, and...

01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:14.739
Well, you're definitely crazy.
But so is everyone, right? So who cares?

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.169
- I just don't feel like doing anything.
- Why?

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.559
'Cause my heart is broken,

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.349
and I can't imagine
doing anything right now.

01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:26.300
It's probably the same reason
you don't go back to school, you know?

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:32.699
Maybe it's good we got hurt like that,
you know?

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:38.089
I don't know about you,
but it makes me feel impervious to pain.

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:41.739
Yeah. Kind of like
there's nothing left to be afraid of.

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.479
- Yeah. No, exactly.
- Right.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.660
We could leap off this rock,
and it won't hurt us as bad as they did.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:52.789
So jump, then.

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:55.229
No, I meant that,
like, as a metaphor, you know?

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:57.310
No. Just do it.

01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:03.010
You'll be fine. Jump.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.750
What the hell?

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.840
Oh, God! Oh, God. I made her kill herself!

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:23.149
You must be crazy!

01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:26.059
- So are you gonna jump or what?
- No!

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:29.629
Come on, Peter!
I can see your vagina from here!

01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:32.448
I can see your hoo-ha.

01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:34.839
I mean, I'll jump!

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.930
Chicken! Come on!

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:56.720
Please, God, don't let me die today.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.288
- I'm okay!
- Okay!

01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:03.288
- I'll just let go, right?
- No, no, no!

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:07.460
If you fall straight down, you'd
probably hit a rock and kill yourself!

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.679
- Totally.
- Yeah.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.939
So what do I do?

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.769
Why don't you press your feet
up against the rock,

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:16.859
and, like, shoot yourself off!

01:09:16.859 --> 01:09:18.639
- What, like a frog?
- I don't know, Peter!

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.339
Just get off the fucking rock!

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:23.729
- Here I go!
- Okay!

01:09:23.729 --> 01:09:24.990
One!

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:27.990
Two!

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.899
Two!

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.908
- Two and a half!
- Jump!

01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:36.340
Three!

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:53.559
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.429
- You saw that, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw it!

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:57.949
I was there. I witnessed it.

01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:59.300
Thanks.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.440
Come on.

01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:18.180
You've got Christ between your thighs,

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.480
but with a shorter beard.

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:24.610
<i>- Mahalo.
- Aloha.</i>

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:27.569
- Sex!
- I'm cramping, I'm cramping.

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:29.220
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.790
Petey? Petey?

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.489
Sorry. I knocked a bunch.

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:41.750
You were really out.
Ken sent me.

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.749
Dakota Fanning and her people,
they need this room.

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:48.400
She loves it here.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.400
Oh.

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:52.489
So does that mean I have
to leave the hotel?

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:53.540
Ken found you a room.

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:58.190
I'll take it, yeah.
I wanna hang out with Rachel a little more.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.710
Are those sad tissues or happy tissues?

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.890
Maybe you should just give me a minute.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:16.459
It was the only room available!

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.240
I'm sure it was!

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.499
- Hey, how's it going?
- It's all right.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.069
Really?

01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:29.589
I think you got some pain behind
those eyes. A kind of pain that only...

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:31.239
Okay, you know what?
Let's cut the bullshit.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.549
I wanna stand up on a wave before I leave.

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:35.419
I don't think you're ready yet, man.

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:38.980
- I'm ready to ride giants, Koonu.
- I think you're ready.

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:02.860
Petey!

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.119
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.949
Miss Marshall, what can I do for you?

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:14.509
Is there a place
to get good sushi around here?

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:18.690
Yeah. Yeah, there's a really great place
about five minutes from here called Asuki.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.599
Perfect.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.259
- Do you want me to get you a map?
- Please.

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.390
Okay.

01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:27.559
So, this is where we are.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.739
Head down Kamehameha,
and then pass Funaho Loko Marsh.

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.739
And it should be right to the left.

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:35.999
It might take, like, five minutes.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.390
- Great. Thank you.
- Any time.

01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:43.609
Um...

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:47.259
- I saw you with Peter Bretter...
- Yeah.

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.999
...who's my ex-boyfriend.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.309
Oh, my God. I'm really sorry.

01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:54.789
- No.
- It's not like that at all.

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:56.349
- It's not what you're...
- No, it's fine.

01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:58.439
I'm just really glad
you're keeping him company, 'cause...

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.269
- Gosh, no.
...you seem like a really nice person,

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:04.049
- and you're very pretty.
- Thank you.

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:06.569
Gosh, you're, like, way prettier.

01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:08.880
No, you're, like, so pretty.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.310
Really?

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:16.789
- Yeah.
- Wow, thank you. Thank you.

01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:18.969
And one more thing about Peter.

01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:24.790
He's a really good guy. Really good.
Like, great, actually.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.580
Yeah.

01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:28.270
Um...

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.709
Please don't cry, Miss Marshall.

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:37.539
God. Do you need me to get you a tissue?

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:40.360
Oh, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.540
Okay.

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.370
- Thank you, Rachel.
- Any time, Miss Marshall.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.459
Hey, ahoy, there!

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.239
You surf, too?

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.149
Good Lord, no.
I'm just drifting around, you know?

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:09.330
Getting in touch with the ocean and stuff.
It's really pleasant.

01:14:09.630 --> 01:14:11.200
It was, yeah.

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.109
I'm gonna head in.

01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:16.549
Before you go, actually, Peter,
I just wanted to tell you,

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:18.939
I was listening to Sarah's iPod
the other day,

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:22.899
and amidst the interminable dross
that's on that thing,

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.069
I found one track that I quite liked.

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:28.199
So I checked what it was,
and it was actually one of yours.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:33.200
And it kind of reminded me of a dark,
gothic Neil Diamond. It's great.

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.639
That's, like, exactly what I'm going for.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.210
Right, yeah.

01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:43.340
Fuck.

01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:46.770
Fuck, you're cool.

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:53.120
It's so hard to say,
because, like, I hate you in so many ways,

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.209
but whatever.
I can see why Sarah likes you.

01:14:57.210 --> 01:15:00.729
No accounting for taste, I suppose.
In her case, anyway.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:03.869
She was with me for five years,
so there you go.

01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:06.780
Yeah, you got four on me there, mate.

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.129
You slept with Sarah a year ago?

01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:16.260
I thought you knew!
Peter, please, don't take it seriously.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.609
- What the fuck, man! You've...
- Don't get offended by that.

01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:22.000
You can't be so casual about this!

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.129
This isn't Europe, okay?
There are rules here.

01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:28.789
I'm really sorry.
I apologise for offending you, Peter.

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:32.049
I just hope this doesn't
ruin our friendship.

01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:33.479
Well, what's that about?

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.830
What do you think it's about?
This is a big deal!

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:37.869
What about a code of the ocean?
That's not on.

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:39.009
What about codes among men?

01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:40.269
You don't sleep
with another man's girlfriend!

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:41.529
- Think of...
- Get out of here!

01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:44.660
- All right, okay! All right!
- Get out of here!

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:09.970
Oh, God!

01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:34.800
Koonu! This guy needs help! Koonu!

01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:41.069
- Should I call the front desk?
- It hurts. It hurts.

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:43.459
Wow, you got coral right there in your leg!

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.019
Can you get it out of my leg, please,
hotel man?

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:46.149
Can you do something about that?

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:50.330
I'd love to, you know, but hotel policy...
They don't let me do that kind of thing.

01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.419
They get all weirded out. Insurance...

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.419
Koonu, can you call
the front desk for me, please?

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:56.069
- Yeah.
- It really hurts.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:59.069
Koonu, call the front desk now!

01:16:59.070 --> 01:17:01.159
Okay, monster man.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.069
Pete, he's not gonna do nothing.

01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:05.029
I kind of have this thing
about blood, okay?

01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:08.899
Look at it. It's raping my leg. Peter,
get it out of my fucking leg, please!

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:11.199
One, two.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.379
- You can't get it out.
- It's really in there.

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.899
- Get it out of me!
- Three!

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.159
Fuck my arse!

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.079
Okay, I got it. It's all done.
It's all over.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.560
Everything looks fine.

01:17:25.770 --> 01:17:28.689
<i>It's all good! They're coming wiki wiki.</i>

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:32.860
Can you get some towels for me, please?
I'm really losing a lot of blood.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.169
You sound like you're from London.

01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:37.250
Yeah, I'm from London.

01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:44.559
What's going on?

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.739
You fainted.
I didn't want you to wake up by yourself.

01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:52.259
- How's your friend? Is he all right?
- Yeah.

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.779
They gave him stitches,
and he's sleeping it off.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.959
- Hey, you wanna hear something funny?
- What?

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.259
Are you ready to laugh?
'Cause this is a gas.

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.609
Okay.

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:04.179
Edward Scissorhands over there told me
that you two were fucking each other

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.869
for a whole God damn year
while we were together.

01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:07.999
Shit.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.789
How about that, Sarah?

01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:11.440
I'm sorry, Peter.

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:15.609
Pete, you shouldn't be up
and walking around. Can you please...

01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:18.349
Please don't touch me.
Just don't touch me, okay?

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.089
I'm not touching you.

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:22.400
Will you just please sit? Please?

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.269
All right, I'll sit down,
but I'm sitting down 'cause I want to,

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:30.440
not because you've asked me to sit, okay?

01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:31.790
Great.

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:38.970
A year?

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.529
Listen, I get it, okay? I just...

01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:45.529
I need to understand what I did
to make you cheat. I just...

01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:52.099
Pete, it's not anything you did.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.969
You didn't do anything.
I mean, you were great.

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:58.799
Will you please cut the bullshit
and have a talk with me?

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.630
Fine. Cutting the bullshit.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.889
It got really hard to keep taking care of you
when you stopped taking care of yourself.

01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:07.149
I tried to get you out of the house.

01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:12.019
I tried to get you off your little island
you loved so much, the couch.

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.799
You didn't wanna see the light of day!

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.980
God, there was one week
when you wore sweatpants! Every day.

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:26.550
You shall not pass!

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.029
You know what? If they were Sean John
sweatpants, it would have been fine.

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:34.239
But because they're Costco brand,
it's like the worst thing I could do.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.809
That has nothing to do with it.
That's what you don't get.

01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:41.639
I'm sorry that I didn't end up being
who we thought I was gonna be, you know?

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:46.549
I tried really hard. I promise you that.
I just didn't have it in me.

01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:49.069
I think if you had just,
maybe tried harder.

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:51.469
I tried!

01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:54.079
You have no idea how hard I tried, Peter.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.729
I talked to a therapist.

01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:58.119
I talked to my mother.
I read every book possible.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.339
I took love seminars. I took sex seminars.

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.899
None of it worked.
None of it made a difference to you.

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:06.379
And I couldn't drown with you any more.

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.169
Don't you dare sit there
and tell me that I didn't try.

01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:13.249
I did.

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:15.650
You were just too stupid to notice.

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:51.829
Whoa. I thought you were gonna wear
the shirt I got you.

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:53.609
What? No.

01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:56.399
I mean, I do love that shirt you got me.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:59.139
I admire Sir Tommy Bahama an awful lot.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:02.960
He's a talented man, but tonight,
I feel that this is appropriate.

01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:11.620
Wow, thank you. Yeah, Sarah got it for me.

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:16.230
This is, like, way more convenient
than my backpack.

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:20.789
Awesome hat!

01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:22.879
Thank you.
Yeah, my girlfriend got it for me!

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.580
- I'm fucking with you!
- Cool!

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.580
Sarah, can I use this lipstick, please?

01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:40.540
Sure. I don't care.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.799
I think it looks great.
But if you're not, let's go change.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.319
No, I like it. I didn't like it at first.
Now I really think it's...

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.109
Oh, bloody hell. This is a small resort.

01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:51.590
Hi, Peter.

01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:55.410
Hey. Wow.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.069
Aldous, Sarah, this is Rachel.

01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:01.679
Sarah bought me this shirt.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.069
I could've guessed that. Yeah.

01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:04.289
- Looks great.
- You look great.

01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:06.289
Looks awesome.

01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:08.459
- See.
- Thanks.

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:12.640
Mr Snow, I'm so sorry.
I did not know you guys were coming.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:13.899
You're gonna have to wait five minutes.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.029
I did not know you guys were coming.

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.809
It's okay. It's not a problem.

01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:18.679
I didn't see you guys, so...

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.200
There's really no need to weep.

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.460
I'm not crying.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.859
It's no problem, honestly.
It's not a problem.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:30.989
- So, your table is ready, guys.
- Oh, great.

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:32.639
Hey, have a lovely evening, you two.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.549
- Thank you. Have a great dinner, you guys.
- Thank you.

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:35.989
You're welcome to join us, obviously,
if you want.

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:37.859
- Okay.
- Wouldn't dream of it. What?

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:39.030
What?

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.949
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:43.729
That's great. Awesome.
- Sure.

01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:45.079
Great. I'll just set two more places.

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.209
- Okay.
- Not a big deal.

01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:47.689
Awesome.

01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:51.860
So this is actually happening.
We're gonna let this happen.

01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:53.519
I am so sorry.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.560
I never thought in a million years
she would say yes.

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:57.689
I did.

01:22:57.690 --> 01:23:00.689
What? I just accepted an invitation.
I didn't wanna be rude.

01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:02.469
It's got us in a terrible situation.

01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:04.559
Now I'm gonna have to sit with him
wearing this shirt all night.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.429
You're wearing the shirt regardless.

01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:08.219
Australia is amazing.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:11.779
- I'm telling you. It is a great place to shoot.
- Yeah?

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:15.089
Rachel, you would love it.
You would love it.

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.909
I wanna go. I really,
really wanna go there.

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:19.910
- Wait, so when's the movie coming out?
- Mmm.

01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:23.129
It came out.

01:23:23.130 --> 01:23:25.000
- It was already released.
- Oh.

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.699
Well, you know, it's an island.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:30.829
It's isolated.

01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:32.309
- Yeah.
- Movies don't really come out here.

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:35.009
- Obviously.
- Did you like it?

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:36.570
- The movie?
- Yeah.

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.919
- It was...
- Awful bloody film.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.089
I say, it's just a ridiculous premise.

01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:45.750
What would happen
if your mobile phone killed you?

01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:52.749
I told her that when she read the script.

01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:54.399
Yeah. You were the voice of reason, mate.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.189
I tried to be, but she didn't listen.

01:23:56.190 --> 01:23:59.009
Going around killing people.
A mobile phone, like, doing murders.

01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:00.969
Why couldn't you just take the battery
out of the phone?

01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:02.449
Right. That's it. The battle's over.

01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:04.839
- Yeah, we've won.
I hated it.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.929
Well, it's not for everyone, but it...

01:24:06.930 --> 01:24:09.009
No, it's ridiculous.
Here's my favourite scene.

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:10.670
Ring-ring. Hello?

01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:13.409
Right. It would never happen.
- Yeah.

01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:14.839
No, it could never happen.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.019
It's a metaphor for
addiction to technology.

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:23.189
For society,
for how we're reliant on technology.

01:24:23.190 --> 01:24:24.319
I get it. I'm with you.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.670
It's a metaphor for a crap movie.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.189
Well, it was the right choice
for me at the time.

01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:29.850
Sure.
- You know?

01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:43.630
Well, this is awkward.

01:24:47.890 --> 01:24:48.940
Yeah?

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.159
- It's a bit more awkward now.
A little.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.199
Hey, excuse me.
Can we get another bottle of wine, please?

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.459
- Sure.
- Thank you.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.589
Mr Snow?

01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:59.979
Can I get cranberry juice
with a bit of lime in it, please.

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.679
Do you want cranberry juice
or cranberry cocktail?

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.289
Because I can probably rustle
up either one. Throw some OJ...

01:25:04.290 --> 01:25:06.339
I don't care.

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:07.810
Okay, great.

01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:19.600
Hey, can we get another bottle of wine?

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.169
If I've learned anything from addiction,
it's that,

01:25:31.170 --> 01:25:35.779
you know, life is as brief as the
twinkling of a star over all too soon.

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:37.650
So if you're in a situation
where you're with a woman,

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.299
why not do the most interesting thing
that you can do in that situation?

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.779
And by which, I don't mean
have a conversation,

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.349
have a chin-wag, a bit of a chat.

01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:48.779
Lose yourself in something
that's both ancient and perennial.

01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:52.960
Find something eternal, perpetual.
Lose yourself in fuck.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.349
I'm going to disagree.

01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:58.779
Respectfully, of course, sir.

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.999
Maybe for you, that works.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.219
For me, it's much more enjoyable
to get to know somebody.

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.919
If you end up sleeping with them,
that's great.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.089
But I like getting to know somebody.

01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:09.140
But he...

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:13.699
What he's saying is that
he's gonna stick it wherever he wants,

01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:16.309
but he's joking.

01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:18.089
I ain't. No, I'm not joking.

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:20.490
It's just what I believe, really.

01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:23.399
So...

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:29.139
Just so we're clear and so I can hone in
on your central thesis of the night,

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.709
wade through all the bullshit,

01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:33.529
you're telling me
that you think you have the right

01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:36.229
to just fuck anyone, anywhere, anytime?

01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:38.229
- Yes. There it is. That's right.
- That's what you're saying?

01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:41.359
Not so eloquently
as you just put it, sweetheart.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.799
But ultimately, yes, that is...

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.879
Oh, no! Not the shirt!

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.930
Take my eyes, but not the shirt. Mmm.

01:26:48.450 --> 01:26:51.449
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I believe, Sarah.

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:54.059
When you're done making jokes,
are you gonna get a napkin?

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:56.579
Do you know what? I think I've improved it,
actually, against all odds.

01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:57.929
I think I deserve a design award.

01:26:57.930 --> 01:27:00.019
Please get some seltzer water.

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:02.410
- Garçon, could we get some...
- I saw it from farther away.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.369
- Okay.
- Just lean back for a second.

01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:08.149
No, it's all right. It's not there.
Let me...

01:27:08.150 --> 01:27:09.589
You're very diligent. I appreciate it.

01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:11.589
Let go of the glass now.
You're gonna have to walk away.

01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:13.240
Bless you. There you are.

01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:15.330
Oh, me, oh, my.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.460
- Call the doctor.
- Oh, good.

01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:29.719
- I love Hawaii.
- Is it good?

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:33.899
Yeah, it's nice,
but I think for like a week tops.

01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.769
Any more than that, I know I'd go crazy,

01:27:35.770 --> 01:27:39.639
because I think that
Hawaii is a place to escape

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.550
for people who can't deal
with the real world.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:49.949
Yeah, you know, there's so few
personal shoppers and pet therapists.

01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:52.160
Gosh, it's such a hard life.

01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:04.120
I like living here.

01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:09.560
- Anyone need any more vino?
- I think we're good.

01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:13.519
I've a question for you real quick, Mr S.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.869
I was actually meaning to ask you,
what did you exactly think of my demo?

01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:19.339
Did you get it? Did you get it?

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:22.169
Oh, no. I was gonna listen to that,

01:28:22.170 --> 01:28:25.300
but then I just carried on living my life.

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:29.559
Not at all?

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.569
No, I didn't, because, you know,
I go on my instincts,

01:28:33.570 --> 01:28:35.220
and they weren't good.

01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:40.829
You know what, dude?
Fuck you, okay? You can go fuck yourself.

01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:42.829
I can't yell right now
because I'll get fired.

01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:43.959
My boss will hear me,

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.959
and then I won't be able
to pay off my student loans.

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.869
But you know what? You're an asshole.
I fucking hate you.

01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:50.009
I bought all your records.

01:28:50.010 --> 01:28:52.829
This whole fucking time, I've been trying
to get you to come hang out with me.

01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:57.010
I'm gonna have people fuck with your food
the rest of your trip, you fucking dick!

01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:59.620
I like him. That was quite moving.

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.399
Wait, wait, wait.

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.190
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:21.489
Are you sure that you're not,
like, too drunk?

01:29:21.490 --> 01:29:24.230
Jesus, would you stop being so sensitive.

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:51.540
Aldous.

01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:54.539
Wake up.

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:57.279
- Aldous. Wake up.
- Hmm...

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.850
Make love to me.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.110
All right. You go on top, though,
'cause I'm knackered.

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:20.510
Listen.

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:24.680
Yes! Yes!

01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:29.599
- Yeah.
Yes!

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:31.160
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah!

01:30:34.210 --> 01:30:36.250
- Yeah! Oh, God!
- Yeah!

01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:41.989
- Right there!
- Yes!

01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:44.509
- Yes!
- Yes! She's having an orgasm!

01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:46.469
This is the best sex ever!

01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:48.390
Yeah, all right, that'll do.

01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:50.260
What?

01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:53.260
I made a mistake coming here with you.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.130
And I'm not done either!

01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:02.349
- Please shut up! Okay.
- Okay!

01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:04.649
You're still involved with him next door,
ain't you?

01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:05.779
Excuse me?

01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:07.649
You should've seen yourself
at dinner, Sarah.

01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:11.830
Then we come back here,
and you put on that ghastly performance.

01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:15.179
I mean, I've heard that
women do fake orgasms,

01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:16.739
but I've never seen one.

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.519
It really deeply upset me.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.870
You should have seen yourself at dinner.

01:31:21.610 --> 01:31:25.790
"Oh, I'm Aldous Snow. Bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:28.009
"No, no drinks for me, thanks.

01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:29.659
"Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit."

01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:32.349
That's a really reductive impression.

01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:34.879
If I wanted to see you act badly,
I'd just watch your TV show,

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.179
which, obviously, I can't now,
because it's been cancelled.

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:39.269
Oh, my God, you're such a prick.

01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:40.399
And you know what?

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.529
Let me tell you something
about these tattoos, okay?

01:31:43.530 --> 01:31:47.710
That is Buddhist. That is Nordic.
That is Hindu. That's just gibberish.

01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:50.009
They are completely conflicting ideologies.

01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:52.399
And that does not make you
a citizen of the world.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.270
It makes you full of shit.

01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:00.410
Was that genuine or did you fake that?

01:32:02.410 --> 01:32:06.580
Right. I'm gonna probably clear off now.

01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:08.229
I'll have a little sleep for a few hours,

01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:12.100
then I'm gonna probably go
in the morning, okay?

01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:19.109
I hate your music.

01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:22.410
Yeah, well,
I fucked the housekeeper the other day.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.460
Are you sleeping?

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.760
Not any more.

01:32:38.290 --> 01:32:42.460
I know that I'm leaving in a couple
of days, so I don't even know

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.420
what the hell this means,

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:52.850
but I really like spending
time with you a lot.

01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:57.990
I know. Me too.

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:07.770
Hey.

01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:15.510
Good morning.

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:19.769
Where are you going?

01:33:19.770 --> 01:33:23.209
The Korean Textile Manufacturer's Luau.

01:33:23.210 --> 01:33:25.599
- Just kill me.
- Fun.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.650
Joy.

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:32.170
I want you to know
that I meant what I said last night.

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.000
I know you did.

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.820
I did, too.

01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:43.040
- Can I see you again tonight?
- Yeah.

01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:46.040
- I get off at 7:00.
- Yay.

01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:48.040
Bye.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.389
Sir, morning mai tai.

01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:54.389
You know what?

01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:58.350
I actually will not be having
an alcoholic beverage this morning.

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.880
Jump! Jump! Jump!
- Don't make me do it.

01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:49.450
Hey. Morning, mate.

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.019
- How are you today?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. You okay?

01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:56.239
Am I okay? I'm better than okay, my friend.

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.889
You seem sprightly.

01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:59.150
I...

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.449
I had a great time last night.

01:35:01.450 --> 01:35:04.889
- Congratulations. Well done. Well done.
- Thank you.

01:35:04.890 --> 01:35:06.759
What about you? What's with the bag?

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:10.199
Right, yeah. I'm off back to England, mate.

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:11.679
Oh, you and Sarah are going to England.

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.070
No, no, no. I'm just going alone.

01:35:14.890 --> 01:35:16.849
- Yeah.
- Did you guys have a fight or something?

01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:20.499
Yeah, it was really... How you served
five years under her, I don't know.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:25.199
You deserve a medal or a holiday
or at least a cuddle from somebody.

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.979
You were only here for a week.

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.159
Well, I don't know.
For me, that one week of it

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:33.859
was like going on holiday with,
I don't know, I wouldn't say Hitler,

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:37.289
but certainly Goebbels.
It was like a little holiday with Hitler.

01:35:37.290 --> 01:35:38.769
Jesus.

01:35:38.770 --> 01:35:42.289
Hey, listen, at least it's clear now
for you two to reconnect.

01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:43.550
Oh...

01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:47.119
No, no. No.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.509
You know what?
I have a good thing going on with Rachel,

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:51.289
and I want to see that through.

01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:54.819
Well, maybe you could have both of them.
Rachel and Sarah.

01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:57.729
They got on all right, didn't
they, at dinner? So maybe...

01:35:57.730 --> 01:36:00.249
You know what?
First of all, I'm not that kind of guy.

01:36:00.250 --> 01:36:05.039
And even if I was, I don't think that I have
the sexual competency to really pull that off.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.689
Yeah. It's a gift.

01:36:06.690 --> 01:36:09.949
I will say,
if you do get back with Miss Marshall,

01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:12.260
handle with care, because, you know...

01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:16.209
Okay. Well, I think my ride's here.

01:36:16.210 --> 01:36:18.999
So I'm gonna skedaddle then
before anything else happens to me.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.689
Before life gets any more daft.

01:36:20.690 --> 01:36:22.349
Is someone gonna take that?

01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:24.960
Listen, don't let them grind you down.

01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:27.569
Take it easy.

01:36:27.570 --> 01:36:30.170
Hey, look at my driver.
I'm gonna have sex with her.

01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:37.350
He said it was clear I wasn't over you.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.829
And then he left.

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:43.310
Fucking prick.

01:36:45.310 --> 01:36:48.619
And then I started thinking,
what if he's right?

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.530
What if I'm not over you?

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:56.360
- Sarah...
- Please just let me finish, Pete.

01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:06.580
What if I made
a really, really horrible mistake?

01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:13.670
- Sarah.
- Yeah?

01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:16.269
Stop pulling my face towards your face.

01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:18.149
Why?

01:37:18.150 --> 01:37:19.799
You don't like it?

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.489
Listen, pulling my shirt towards you
is the same concept as pulling my face.

01:37:24.490 --> 01:37:28.670
Let's spend one more night here together,
and then let's go home and then...

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.759
And we'll just pretend
like it never happened.

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.929
...face reality. No.
- That's the big plan?

01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:34.719
No. I love you.

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.850
That's not fair.
That's not fair of you to say that to me.

01:37:39.850 --> 01:37:41.280
Please, Peter.

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.720
- Tell me you're sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:51.590
I missed you.

01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.980
I'm sorry.

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:02.980
God, I missed you, Peter.

01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:11.200
All right.

01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:15.379
Get hard for me, Pete. Get hard for me.

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.199
- I know what I'm supposed to do.
- Okay.

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:20.159
Just do it. Come on. Get hard.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.949
- I'm trying.
- Okay.

01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:23.810
- Here. Just let me do it for a second.
- Okay.

01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:29.249
I really want you, Peter. I missed you.

01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:30.729
You don't want help?

01:38:30.730 --> 01:38:34.169
- You don't want help? Uh-huh.
- Can you be quiet just for a minute?

01:38:34.170 --> 01:38:35.299
Do you want my hands?

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:38.520
Maybe just don't talk for a second
is what I mean.

01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:41.249
Do you want my mouth?

01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:43.730
- Yeah, maybe your mouth.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:54.909
What's the problem, Peter?

01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:57.079
- I don't know...
- More?

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.390
You can keep trying if you want.

01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:05.959
What's wrong with you?

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.129
- Nothing is wrong with me, okay?
- Okay.

01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:10.219
- No, I didn't...
- Just, something doesn't feel right any more.

01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:12.219
Okay. Well, did you... You know what?

01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.389
Did you drink today?
Because sometimes when you drink...

01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:15.959
Excuse me.

01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:18.790
No, I haven't had anything to drink today.

01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:25.879
Maybe the problem is that
you broke my heart into a million pieces,

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:29.619
and so my cock doesn't want
to be around you any more, okay?

01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:30.660
Ever!

01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:35.359
Because you know what I just realised?
Huh?

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:38.180
You're the God damn devil. Okay?

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:45.790
Wedding in Hawaii! Real original!

01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:58.930
- Hey.
- Hey, Rachel.

01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:03.489
- Sarah and Aldous broke up this morning.
- What a surprise.

01:40:03.490 --> 01:40:06.230
So I went to check on Sarah, and...

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:11.539
Listen, I'm here
because I don't want to lie to you, okay?

01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:13.539
Some stuff happened.

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.499
I'm really, really sorry that it did,

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:18.539
but I'm also really glad
that it did, because

01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:23.110
I'm able to see so clearly now that Sarah
and I are not right for each other.

01:40:24.370 --> 01:40:25.850
What stuff?

01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:33.759
I went up to make sure that she was okay,
and it got weird.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.629
But now everything is fine.

01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:37.289
And I need you to understand

01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:39.589
that I meant everything that I said
to you this morning.

01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:40.849
What exactly happened, Peter?

01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:42.509
We fooled around a little bit.

01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:45.720
Shut the fuck up,
and tell me exactly what you did.

01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:53.469
All right. I went to her room,
and she was crying and crying and crying.

01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:55.639
And I felt like I should comfort her.

01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.069
And then she started kissing me
because I was comforting her.

01:40:59.070 --> 01:41:01.289
And then the next thing I knew,
I was kissing her

01:41:01.290 --> 01:41:03.469
because she had been kissing me
because of the comforting.

01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:07.340
Then she started taking my clothes off,
and then her clothes were off.

01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:14.299
Then she performed
10 to 15 seconds of oral sex on me.

01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:15.859
Okay. Peter, you can leave now.

01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:18.599
- At the most. Maximum.
- Thank you for staying at Turtle Bay.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.819
Rachel, please don't do this.

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:22.339
The only reason I'm telling you this
is because I really care about...

01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:24.429
Listen to me, Peter.

01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:27.559
I was a mess, too. I understand. Okay?

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:30.909
But it does not excuse
you acting like a complete asshole.

01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:33.689
Listen, I know that
I fucked things up for a minute,

01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:35.389
but I'm not like every other asshole.

01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:39.039
You should not be with anybody right now.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.260
Anybody.

01:41:42.170 --> 01:41:44.129
I know...

01:41:44.130 --> 01:41:45.779
I know that there is something here.

01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:47.779
I know that I was not wrong about that.

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:51.660
And, yes, it's only been four days,
but I know you feel it, too.

01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:58.090
I need you to leave.

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:04.050
Do not write me. Do not call me.
Do not e-mail me.

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.960
Peter, I need you to go.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.440
I won't bother you any more.

01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:20.840
I'm sorry.

01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:30.230
I don't know what to do.

01:42:38.230 --> 01:42:40.319
Hey, brother, what you doing, huh?
You stealing my art?

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.839
I want you to put it back right now.
Put it back, bro!

01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.449
Listen, give me the picture.

01:42:45.450 --> 01:42:47.839
Doo-doo paper.
You're throwing doo-doo paper?

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.500
Give me the picture.

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.669
Don't be stupid, brother.
Just give me the picture.

01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:58.589
You can hit me as many times as you want.
I'm not giving you the photo back.

01:42:58.590 --> 01:42:59.630
Oh, yeah.

01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:09.940
No, no, no. Peter, I told you
I did not want to see you.

01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:33.199
<i>Aloha, I'm Sarah Marshall

<i>Everybody wishes that you were dead</i>

01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:52.079
<i>Because, Peter, you suck</i>

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.079
<i>Peter, you suck</i>

01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:57.389
<i>Peter, your music is fucking terrible</i>

01:43:57.390 --> 01:44:00.729
<i>Peter, you suck</i>

01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:04.079
<i>Peter, you don't do anything of value</i>

01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.649
<i>Peter, you suck</i>

01:44:05.650 --> 01:44:09.820
<i>Write some music but instead
you sit and write these bullshit songs</i>

01:44:10.130 --> 01:44:11.909
<i>It's so self-loathing</i>

01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:15.219
<i>Go see a psychiatrist
I hate the psychiatrist</i>

01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:16.779
<i>Well, go see one anyway</i>

01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:18.259
<i>I don't like the psychiatrist</i>

01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:19.909
<i>You need to go and see one</i>

01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:21.479
<i>See a psychiatrist</i>

01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:22.960
<i>I'm not going</i>

01:44:58.710 --> 01:45:04.140
<i>It's getting kind of hard to believe
things are going to get better</i>

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.809
I don't understand
what there is to think about.

01:45:52.810 --> 01:45:54.069
Because, D, he...

01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:56.679
She licked the tip. That doesn't count.

01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:59.509
- Of course it counts. He...
- He what?

01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:03.159
He refused a blowjob
from his ex-girlfriend mid-blowjob.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:06.159
Do you know what that's like for a man?
It's called blue balls, Rachel.

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:08.379
This guy is like Gandhi, but better.

01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:09.509
He likes puppets.

01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:10.460
I love puppets.

01:46:12.210 --> 01:46:15.119
I love Fraggle Rock. I love Lamb Chop.
I love Elmo.

<i>But he found a taste</i>

<i>To find a taste for love</i>

01:48:17.670 --> 01:48:24.020
<i>A taste for love</i>

01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:56.860
Wow. You came.
I can't believe that you came.

01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:59.989
Peter, this is great.

01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:03.209
- It was really funny. Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:04.899
You know what?
I didn't realise that it was a comedy,

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:09.470
and then someone told me that, and it
just, like, opened the whole thing up.

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:14.989
- How long are you in town for?
- Open-ended.

01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:16.169
- Bold.
- Yeah.

01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:17.210
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of
checking out some schools.

01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:22.820
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, maybe.

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.740
You never called.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.300
You told me not to. And I listened.

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:35.739
- Right.
- Wasn't easy.

01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:38.259
I might have called once and hung up.

01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:40.780
- No. No.
- From a private number.

01:49:41.610 --> 01:49:42.650
No.

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.609
Maybe.

01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:46.999
Peter!
Nice job, Bretter.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.259
Well, you should probably go back.

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.479
Would you like to hang out
while you're here?

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:52.959
- Maybe we could go to dinner or...
- Yeah.

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.349
- Still have my number?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:58.089
- Go.
- Yeah, I should do that.

01:49:58.090 --> 01:49:59.960
Yeah, yeah. Go mingle.

01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.359
Hey, Peter!
Hey, Bretter!

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.139
Come over here and meet my mom!

01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:09.839
- Go, go.
- Off I go.

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.619
- Hey, Peter.
- Nice job, Bretter.

01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.619
The play was sick, man. Good work.

01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:15.919
- Nice job.
- Good job, man. That was awesome.

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:17.049
So cool!

01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:19.139
Peter, congratulations.

01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:22.659
I just wanted to say thank you.
I had such a great time tonight.

01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:25.189
Oh, good. You know what?
I'm gonna change out of this unitard,

01:50:25.190 --> 01:50:27.059
- 'cause I'm getting a chafe. Okay.
- Enough said.

01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:29.150
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:50:55.110 --> 01:50:56.240
Hey, Peter?

01:50:59.590 --> 01:51:03.020
I was just calling you.

01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:10.550
- Wow.
- Oh, Peter.

01:51:11.370 --> 01:51:14.290
- I'm sorry.
- Stop laughing.

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.640
Can you please stop laughing?

01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:21.290
I missed you.

01:51:22.330 --> 01:51:23.459
I just...

01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:28.070
You know, I actually wanted to tell you
that I've been thinking so much about...

01:52:18.650 --> 01:52:22.699
<i>NARRATOR: This fall, Sarah Marshall is back
in a brand-new role.</i>

01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:26.569
Your wife had no enemies
that you're aware of.

01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:29.259
<i>Get ready for the most daring show
on television.</i>

01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:32.699
- Just came home, and she was lying there.
- Right.

01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:35.960
<i>In a world
where you don't know who to trust.</i>

01:52:39.490 --> 01:52:42.399
Charlie, who's Franco Marconi?

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:45.619
- No. No.
- Gun, gun, gun, gun. Drop it, drop it.

01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:47.839
<i>Go with your animal instincts.</i>

01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:55.310
- How did you know?
- She's an animal psychic.

01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:59.620
<i>Sarah Marshall returns on Animal Instincts.</i>

01:53:00.450 --> 01:53:01.799
Life's a bitch.

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:03.450
And where you're going,
that's exactly what you'll be.
