WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:06.754
Okay, we're headed out--
See you later.

00:06.756 --> 00:07.921
Before you leave,

00:07.923 --> 00:10.290
could you test these
noise-cancelling headphones?

00:10.292 --> 00:11.292
Yeah, sure.

00:11.293 --> 00:12.459
Okay.

00:14.263 --> 00:15.263
Go ahead.

00:15.264 --> 00:18.265
Hello, can you
hear me?

00:21.137 --> 00:22.803
Sheldon, I haven't changed
the filter

00:22.805 --> 00:24.905
in the water pitcher
in two years.

00:27.510 --> 00:31.612
Uh, Bernadette's nickname for
you is the virgin piña colada.

00:34.483 --> 00:38.752
Your George Lucas autograph
is really a “me” autograph.

00:40.890 --> 00:43.891
Yeah, well, once I was too lazy
to walk across the hall,

00:43.893 --> 00:45.626
so I used your toothbrush.

00:47.730 --> 00:49.830
Ooh, and one time
when you were asleep,

00:49.832 --> 00:51.498
Amy totally
took off her...

00:51.500 --> 00:53.700
And that's why
you're the best roommate ever.

00:54.937 --> 00:57.271
Aw...

00:57.273 --> 00:58.772
Now I'm sad I didn't hear it.

00:58.774 --> 01:01.241
So what do you need
the headphones for?

01:01.243 --> 01:02.810
Well, I've been
struggling for months

01:02.812 --> 01:05.045
to come up with
a theory of dark matter

01:05.047 --> 01:06.713
that doesn't
make protons decay.

01:06.715 --> 01:08.415
I'm hoping to
finally tackle it

01:08.417 --> 01:10.417
by optimizing my
work environment.

01:10.419 --> 01:15.055
See, I've got, uh, my tea is at
the perfect sipping temperature.

01:15.057 --> 01:17.591
Uh, I have fleece-lined
boxer shorts

01:17.593 --> 01:18.959
to keep my tushie toasty.

01:18.961 --> 01:20.460
And then, oh,
last but not least,

01:20.462 --> 01:23.397
this inspirational cat poster,

01:23.399 --> 01:25.432
improved with
the reassuring face

01:25.434 --> 01:27.668
of physics renegade
Richard Feynman.

01:30.773 --> 01:33.774
Is that why you had to take him
to Office Depot last night?

01:33.776 --> 01:35.976
I don't want to talk about it.

01:36.812 --> 01:38.212
There, the place is all yours.

01:38.214 --> 01:39.179
Yeah, have fun.

01:39.181 --> 01:41.148
Oh, I will--
nothing more fun

01:41.150 --> 01:42.716
than a paradigm-shifting
evening of science.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.153
And you thought it was
soaping me up in the shower.

01:47.156 --> 01:48.121
Bye.

01:48.123 --> 01:50.724
Okay.

01:50.726 --> 01:52.926
Here we go.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.563
Proton decay.

01:58.033 --> 01:59.900
Proton decay.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.569
Proton decay.

02:03.539 --> 02:05.405
Proton decay.

02:06.542 --> 02:08.976
Proton decay.

02:09.812 --> 02:11.144
Proton decay.

02:11.146 --> 02:12.412
Hey, we're home.

02:14.984 --> 02:16.884
Any progress?

02:16.886 --> 02:17.985
How could there be?!

02:17.987 --> 02:19.853
With these constant
interruptions.

02:21.757 --> 02:25.525
I love him, but if he's broken,
let's not get a new one.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.060
What are you doing?

02:59.062 --> 03:00.295
It's time to go.

03:00.297 --> 03:02.497
I'm not going to work today.

03:02.499 --> 03:04.432
And would you like
to know why?

03:04.434 --> 03:07.469
Ah, you're upset because you
spent the whole night working

03:07.471 --> 03:09.504
on dark matter
and didn't make a breakthrough,

03:09.506 --> 03:11.439
and now you're worried you made
a huge mistake switching fields,

03:11.441 --> 03:13.408
and you're gonna sit around
and sulk all day?

03:13.410 --> 03:16.444
Like a big old baby.

03:17.915 --> 03:19.347
Call me
if you need anything.

03:22.786 --> 03:26.188
I've been cooped up
in here too long.

03:26.190 --> 03:29.191
Maybe I need some fresh air.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:47.377 --> 03:48.410
Penny?

03:49.713 --> 03:50.745
Penny?

03:51.682 --> 03:53.715
Penny?

03:55.018 --> 03:57.052
Ugh, what?

03:57.054 --> 03:58.920
You sounded in distress.

03:58.922 --> 04:00.622
I was worried something
unpleasant was happening to you.

04:00.624 --> 04:02.157
Like a murder.

04:02.159 --> 04:05.126
Or spontaneous coitus
with Leonard.

04:06.897 --> 04:08.463
Oh, I'm just doing
this awful workout.

04:08.465 --> 04:09.664
I hate it.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.067
Well, if you hate it,
then why are you doing it?

04:12.069 --> 04:13.868
Although I could ask
the same question

04:13.870 --> 04:15.637
about coitus with Leonard.

04:15.639 --> 04:18.406
I don't know-- I guess
I like that I hate it.

04:18.408 --> 04:20.041
It makes me work harder.

04:20.043 --> 04:21.875
And to clarify...

04:21.878 --> 04:23.745
The exercise, Sheldon.

04:25.048 --> 04:26.982
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for work?

04:26.984 --> 04:28.483
I'm not going.

04:28.485 --> 04:29.884
Would you like to know why?

04:29.886 --> 04:32.520
Uh, you're sad about not getting
anything done last night,

04:32.522 --> 04:34.856
so you're gonna sit around
and pout about it?

04:35.959 --> 04:38.660
Boy, I'm not nearly as
mysterious as I think I am.

04:40.797 --> 04:41.963
I invented a game.

04:41.965 --> 04:43.665
You want to play?
Sure.

04:43.667 --> 04:46.067
It's called
“Emily or Cinnamon”"

04:46.069 --> 04:49.404
I give you actual quotes
I've heard Raj say,

04:49.406 --> 04:53.642
and you guess if he was talking
to his girlfriend or his dog.

04:57.581 --> 04:59.247
Go ahead, make fun.

04:59.249 --> 05:00.282
You can't embarrass .

05:00.284 --> 05:01.716
I've got a beautiful
girlfriend

05:01.718 --> 05:04.619
and a dog who loves me so much
she drinks my bathwater.

05:06.790 --> 05:10.125
Okay, who was he talking to,
Emily or Cinnamon:

05:10.127 --> 05:12.861
“I want you to know,
the bed feels so lonely

05:12.863 --> 05:14.562
when you're not in it.”

05:21.004 --> 05:23.271
I may not be liking
this game so much.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.308
Cinnamon.
Give me another one.

05:27.177 --> 05:28.677
Okay, Emily or Cinnamon:

05:28.679 --> 05:30.712
“Check it out,
I got us matching sweaters!”

05:30.714 --> 05:33.248
We all got the Christmas card--
Cinnamon.

05:34.718 --> 05:38.086
You know, a man can care deeply
about a woman and a pet.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.120
It's not strange.

05:39.122 --> 05:40.088
Ooh, Emily.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.290
I heard him say that
to Emily.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.327
Hey, I thought
you were staying home.

05:45.329 --> 05:47.729
Yeah, I was, but after
talking to Penny,

05:47.731 --> 05:49.331
I realized something.

05:49.333 --> 05:52.701
I... first, she's trying much
harder to stay attractive

05:52.703 --> 05:55.003
in this relationship
than you are.

05:59.176 --> 06:00.642
E'
And second...

06:00.644 --> 06:03.578
the reason I may not be
progressing in my research is

06:03.580 --> 06:07.248
I've created too pleasant
of an environment for myself.

06:07.250 --> 06:08.583
What do you me?

06:08.585 --> 06:11.086
According to a classic
psychological experiment

06:11.088 --> 06:14.422
by Yerkes and Dodson, in order
to maximize performance,

06:14.424 --> 06:17.559
one must create a state
of productive anxiety.

06:17.561 --> 06:21.262
So I'd like to ask you all
to do something for me.

06:21.264 --> 06:23.098
Keep me on my toes.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.266
Just throw me off my game.

06:25.268 --> 06:29.371
E-Essentially, go out of your
way to make my life miserable.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.508
Hold on.

06:33.510 --> 06:35.076
What's in it for us?

06:35.078 --> 06:37.178
Well, I suppose...
Okay, we'll do it!

06:45.989 --> 06:47.288
Done.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.923
33 seconds.

06:48.925 --> 06:50.825
Okay, that'll be
our baseline.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.527
You know, I don't
want to tell you

06:52.529 --> 06:55.029
how to do your job, but when
a mouse completes a maze,

06:55.031 --> 06:56.965
it gets a food pellet.

06:56.967 --> 07:00.668
It also gets its brain
plucked out with tweezers.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.705
And his last meal was
a food pellet?

07:03.707 --> 07:05.206
You're a monster.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.310
All right, next,
we're gonna introduce

07:09.312 --> 07:11.813
an anxiety-inducing stimulus,
measure your stress levels

07:11.815 --> 07:13.548
and see how it affects
your problem-solving rate.

07:13.550 --> 07:14.582
Very well.

07:14.584 --> 07:17.318
And good luck--
I'm a pretty laid-back guy.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.355
Ready?

07:20.357 --> 07:21.890
Begin.

07:44.281 --> 07:45.914
Why'd you pop it?

07:45.916 --> 07:48.183
I'm sorry, I was aiming
for your heart.

07:51.321 --> 07:52.821
Look, I know you
don't like it'

07:52.823 --> 07:54.355
but that's the point
of the experiment.

07:54.357 --> 07:55.924
I need to irritate you

07:55.926 --> 07:58.226
to find your optimal
anxiety zone.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.728
And you said no to
tickling, polka music

08:00.730 --> 08:02.931
or watching me
eat a banana.

08:02.933 --> 08:05.733
Who eats them
horizontally?!

08:06.937 --> 08:09.204
My mother said that's
how good girls do it.

08:13.376 --> 08:15.577
Perhaps this was
a waste of time.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.212
Sheldon,

08:17.214 --> 08:19.147
you're a remarkable scientist.

08:19.149 --> 08:21.583
Just be patient-- I'm sure
you'll find the breakthrough

08:21.585 --> 08:22.917
you've been looking for.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.419
Thank you.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.054
And if you only
do solid research

08:26.056 --> 08:29.123
instead of making
a groundbreaking discovery,

08:29.125 --> 08:30.625
what does it matter?

08:30.627 --> 08:32.994
“Only do solid research”?!

08:32.996 --> 08:35.964
Uh... I come to you for help,
and you insult me?!

08:35.966 --> 08:38.032
I thought the least that
you would do would be...

08:38.034 --> 08:40.034
Look, your anxiety levels
are right in the zone.

08:40.035 --> 08:41.369
Really?

08:41.371 --> 08:43.004
Oh, that's fantastic.

08:43.006 --> 08:44.272
N-Now, wait,
they're dropping.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.406
Why are they dropping?

08:45.408 --> 08:47.375
Because you're happy
they're elevated.

08:47.377 --> 08:49.177
Oh, that is infuriating!

08:49.179 --> 08:50.712
Ooh, look, they went
back up again.

08:50.714 --> 08:51.679
Terrific.

08:51.681 --> 08:53.481
Oh, no, they went
back down!

08:55.652 --> 08:59.654
All right, guys, what game
do you want to play?

08:59.656 --> 09:00.889
E'
Let's see.

09:00.891 --> 09:04.626
How about
“Emily or Cinnamon”"

09:05.695 --> 09:07.562
You know what? I think
it's a little weird

09:07.564 --> 09:09.397
that you remember me
saying all these things.E'

09:09.399 --> 09:12.901
Maybe the truth is-- you're
jealous of all my relationships.

09:13.703 --> 09:15.737
Oh, maybe I am.

09:15.739 --> 09:17.438
Who wouldn't want
to be the girl,

09:17.440 --> 09:20.441
or possibly dog,
to hear the words:

09:20.443 --> 09:22.410
“You're so lucky.

09:22.412 --> 09:24.512
You have the
shiniest hair”.

09:28.018 --> 09:29.984
That is a tough one.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.220
Uh, I-I know he brushes
both of them.

09:34.090 --> 09:36.457
Gentlemen...
Yeah.

09:36.459 --> 09:39.627
I have figured out the perfect
way for you to irritate me.

09:39.629 --> 09:43.498
I'd like you to be my
intellectual sparring partners.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.900
From now on,
when I make an assertion,

09:45.902 --> 09:47.335
I need you to challenge it.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.805
So you just want us to disagree
with whatever you say?

09:50.807 --> 09:51.973
Yes.

09:51.975 --> 09:54.842
And you think that's going to help?
Yes.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.445
Well, I don't think
that's gonna help at all.

09:57.447 --> 09:58.880
Oh, no, it will.

09:58.882 --> 10:02.383
See, by keeping my mind engaged,
I'll become more focused.

10:02.385 --> 10:04.786
Howard's right--
that'll never work.

10:04.788 --> 10:06.421
Stop fighting me on the premise.

10:06.423 --> 10:08.022
It's scientifically valid.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.624
I'm going to advance
propositions,

10:09.626 --> 10:11.192
I just want you to challenge me.

10:11.194 --> 10:14.062
I don't think that's
what you want at all.

10:15.131 --> 10:16.764
Why, of course it's what I want.

10:16.766 --> 10:19.300
Why would I say it's what I want
if it's not what I want?

10:19.302 --> 10:22.537
Because it is what you want,
and it's not what you said.

10:24.341 --> 10:27.041
I ask you for one simple thing,
and you can't even do it.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.610
Yes, we can.
Yeah, well, then do it.

10:28.612 --> 10:30.244
Nah.

10:31.114 --> 10:33.047
You guys are the worst.

10:35.285 --> 10:38.086
Thank you,
I think that was helpful.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.682
So, whichever rep has
the best sales for the quarter

10:49.684 --> 10:51.250
gets a trip for two to Hawaii.

10:51.252 --> 10:53.819
That would be so romantic
for you and Leonard.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.188
Yeah, clearly you haven't
seen him on the beach

10:56.190 --> 10:58.090
walking around
with his metal detector.

10:59.427 --> 11:00.726
If I were going to Hawaii,

11:00.728 --> 11:03.395
I'd spend all my time
at the Keck Observatory.

11:03.397 --> 11:05.064
Did you know that
the telescopes there have

11:05.066 --> 11:06.599
better resolution
than the Hubble?

11:06.601 --> 11:08.033
Really?

11:08.035 --> 11:10.102
Want to go to Hawaii?

11:11.072 --> 11:12.071
Ladies?

11:12.073 --> 11:13.806
Ladies...

11:13.808 --> 11:15.541
Ladies?

11:15.543 --> 11:17.076
Come in.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.445
Ladies.

11:19.447 --> 11:20.946
What's up?

11:20.948 --> 11:23.282
As you may know,
I've been experimenting

11:23.284 --> 11:25.017
with elevated anxiety levels,

11:25.019 --> 11:26.252
and I thought,

11:26.254 --> 11:28.220
what better way
to increase my discomfort

11:28.222 --> 11:29.922
than to subject myself
to an evening

11:29.924 --> 11:32.491
of tasteless
uncensored crotch talk?

11:35.129 --> 11:38.130
What exactly do you think
goes on here?

11:38.132 --> 11:39.732
Well...

11:39.734 --> 11:41.433
conversations that you wouldn't
be comfortable having

11:41.435 --> 11:43.068
in front of the opposite sex.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.870
You know, who has
the best cervix.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.108
Which sanitary napkin
is all the rage right now.

11:49.110 --> 11:52.645
Men's buttocks, and how you want
to pat and squeeze them.

11:54.282 --> 11:56.715
We were talking
about Penny's job.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.651
And how difficult it is to do

11:58.653 --> 12:00.719
when she's bloated,
cranky and crampy?

12:00.721 --> 12:02.821
Continue.

12:04.659 --> 12:06.592
Sheldon, we are just people.

12:06.594 --> 12:08.794
We talk about the same things
you guys talk about.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.563
You talk about
if werewolves can swim?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.232
See, Leonard says yes,

12:13.234 --> 12:15.935
but I say it depends on
if the human could swim

12:15.937 --> 12:16.902
before he was bitten.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.570
What do you think?

12:19.573 --> 12:22.441
Let's just talk
about our periods.

12:22.443 --> 12:24.043
No, hold on.

12:24.045 --> 12:27.046
All canines instinctively know
how to swim.

12:27.048 --> 12:29.748
Why wouldn't a werewolf have
the same abilities?

12:29.750 --> 12:32.418
Well, they're not
a hundred percent wolf.

12:32.420 --> 12:35.187
They're a werewolf--
that's only part wolf.

12:35.189 --> 12:37.289
It's like comparing
apples to oranges.

12:37.291 --> 12:39.091
Thank you.

12:39.093 --> 12:41.794
Oh, and technically, it's apples
that turn into were-oranges

12:41.796 --> 12:43.495
when the moon is full.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.832
Hey, this is fun.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.934
We should do it sometime
when you aren't all PMS'ing.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.502
Bye.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.546
What is going on?

13:00.548 --> 13:01.814
Oh.

13:01.816 --> 13:04.483
Uh, I need to keep my anxiety
at the right level,

13:04.485 --> 13:08.253
so I'm using Darth Vader,
the Joker, and Godzilla's roar

13:08.255 --> 13:10.022
to keep me in that sweet spot.

13:12.093 --> 13:14.460
Uh, I tried including
Taylor Swift in the mix,

13:14.462 --> 13:16.662
but turns out I love her.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.667
Well, at least listen to it
through headphones.

13:21.669 --> 13:23.669
I'm trying to sleep.
Good night.

13:24.505 --> 13:26.205
Boy!

13:27.475 --> 13:30.709
Taylor was right-- haters gonna
hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.548
You've been working
so much lately,

13:36.550 --> 13:38.617
I'm glad you didn't forget
about date night.

13:38.619 --> 13:40.152
Of course.

13:42.423 --> 13:43.423
Sheldon.

13:43.424 --> 13:44.990
Yeah.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.893
Maybe you want to put the
notebook away and talk to me.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.928
I can do both.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.598
No, my brain is working
at optimal capacity.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.633
No, I can have
a conversation with you

13:54.635 --> 13:58.771
and solve the dark matter proton
decay problem at the same time.

13:59.874 --> 14:01.240
Fine.
How was your day?

14:01.242 --> 14:02.741
Oh, you said it.

14:05.279 --> 14:06.578
Sheldon.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.247
Sheldon, I'm
worried about you.

14:08.249 --> 14:09.982
You're not eating,

14:09.984 --> 14:11.984
you haven't
slept in days,

14:11.986 --> 14:14.753
and, to be honest, that
cap is starting to smell.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.556
I know.

14:17.558 --> 14:20.259
It's replaced Godzilla as
my principle source of anxiety.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.933
Okay, so it's one vote Emily,
one vote Cinnamon.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.035
Penny, you're
the tiebreaker.

14:33.007 --> 14:34.473
Say the quote again.

14:34.475 --> 14:38.777
“It's just so perfect
that we're both Libras.”

14:43.918 --> 14:46.218
Wow, this is hard.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.252
I'm gonna say
Cinnamon.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.354
Yes! Yes!
Come on!

14:50.691 --> 14:52.391
That was the last one,
I promise.

14:52.393 --> 14:53.625
We won't play anymore.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.060
Thank you.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.296
'Cause if she ever found out,
it would hurt her feelings.

14:57.298 --> 15:00.132
Emily's feelings?

15:00.134 --> 15:02.000
Yes, Emily.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.969
Nice! - Yay!
Good job!

15:05.706 --> 15:07.406
Whatever.
Where's Sheldon?

15:07.408 --> 15:08.640
Date night.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.342
Mmm, that can't be
much fun for Amy.

15:10.344 --> 15:12.845
You know, at work today,
he tried his first Red Bull.

15:12.847 --> 15:13.879
What happened?

15:13.881 --> 15:15.214
He chased a squirrel

15:15.216 --> 15:17.216
around the quad
for a while and...

15:18.185 --> 15:20.352
...then threw up in my car.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.490
Don't you think you should
make him stop all this?

15:24.492 --> 15:26.925
I don't know-- he's not
really hurting anybody.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.996
You didn't have to scoop vomit
out of your glove compartment.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.764
He is getting
a lot of work done.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.501
He had a pretty interesting
take on proton decay.

15:35.503 --> 15:39.171
Wow, if he cracks that,
it's a game changer, guys.

15:39.173 --> 15:41.206
It'll completely redefine
our understanding

15:41.208 --> 15:42.875
of the physical universe.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.612
Hmm, it would.

15:46.614 --> 15:49.181
Okay, back to
“Emily or Cinnamon”"

15:50.451 --> 15:55.120
“How can such a little girl
eat such a big steak”"

15:59.693 --> 16:00.826
Sheldon,

16:00.828 --> 16:02.661
I want you to take
that cap off.

16:02.663 --> 16:06.698
That nagging tone is
helping my anxiety, yeah.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.034
But if you could maybe just go
ten percent less shrill,

16:09.036 --> 16:11.670
that'd really put the zip-a-Dee
in my doo-dah.

16:11.672 --> 16:14.206
I'm sorry, but
you know we agreed

16:14.208 --> 16:15.941
not to bring work
to date night.

16:15.943 --> 16:18.377
There you go, perfect.

16:18.379 --> 16:20.345
Sheldon, stop it,
I'm not kidding.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.182
Take the cap off, and
put the notebook away.

16:23.184 --> 16:26.885
But after months of struggling,
I'm finally making progress.

16:26.887 --> 16:29.788
You don't need to drive yourself
crazy in order to be productive.

16:29.790 --> 16:31.723
Or do I, hmm?

16:31.725 --> 16:34.092
Sir Isaac Newton wrote
his <i> Principia</i>

16:34.094 --> 16:36.728
while convinced he was
an armadillo.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.096
That's not true.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.765
Yeah, well, maybe it is,
maybe it isn't.

16:39.767 --> 16:41.633
I have been
hallucinating lately.

16:43.971 --> 16:45.571
Sheldon, this has to stop.

16:45.573 --> 16:48.106
You need to get some sleep
and take care of yourself.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.943
Amy, I have gotten more done
in the last few days

16:50.945 --> 16:53.278
than I have since I made
the switch to dark matter.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.648
What if I stop doing this,
and it all goes away?

16:56.650 --> 17:00.385
Your thoughts and ideas come
from you, not from your anxiety.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.653
Hmm, perhaps.

17:01.655 --> 17:03.322
But I'm not taking
the cap off.

17:04.258 --> 17:06.258
It's one thing to make
yourself miserable,

17:06.260 --> 17:08.627
but you're making everyone
around you miserable, too.

17:08.628 --> 17:12.330
Now, I'm telling you for the
last time-- take the cap off.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.965
Oh!

17:13.968 --> 17:15.300
Really?

17:15.301 --> 17:16.935
What if I don't?

17:16.936 --> 17:20.305
And before you answer that,
can I have my dessert?

17:21.742 --> 17:23.976
And then she
threw me out.

17:26.747 --> 17:29.014
Me, her very
own boyfriend.

17:29.016 --> 17:31.717
When all I've done is try
to help humanity reach

17:31.719 --> 17:34.920
a more profound understanding
of the world we live in.

17:38.092 --> 17:39.424
Yeah, well, women--

17:39.426 --> 17:41.293
what are you gonna do?

17:44.031 --> 17:46.565
I knew you'd understand,
Armadillo Isaac Newton.

17:51.005 --> 17:53.672
Okay...

17:53.674 --> 17:56.008
Here we are.

17:56.010 --> 17:57.976
Hey.

17:57.978 --> 17:59.811
What are you trying to pull?

17:59.813 --> 18:03.148
The president of
science isn't in here.

18:03.150 --> 18:06.051
You lie down, he'll be here
in a minute.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.987
Okay.

18:08.989 --> 18:11.156
Hey, I thought you were
trying to trick me.

18:14.228 --> 18:15.894
Now, you just
get comfortable.

18:15.896 --> 18:18.563
No, no, comfort is the enemy.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.865
You know what's comfortable?

18:19.867 --> 18:23.602
Slippers and blankets
and panda bears.

18:24.838 --> 18:29.007
Imagine a panda bear with
Richard Feynman's face on it.

18:30.344 --> 18:33.512
Warm up the car, Leonard,
it's poster time.

18:33.514 --> 18:35.147
Maybe in the morning.

18:35.149 --> 18:36.581
Yeah, you get
some sleep.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.051
No, I don't want to go
to sleep-- you can't make me.

18:39.053 --> 18:40.519
You're right, we can't.

18:40.521 --> 18:41.787
Yeah, darn straight, you can't.

18:41.789 --> 18:43.322
Try to tell a grown man
to go to sleep...

18:43.324 --> 18:46.024
♪ Soft kitty ♪

18:46.026 --> 18:48.193
♪ Warm kitty ♪

18:48.195 --> 18:50.696
♪ Little ball of fur... ♪

18:50.698 --> 18:53.031
That's not gonna work.

18:53.033 --> 18:56.668

18:56.670 --> 18:57.636

19:03.277 --> 19:05.811
You know, he can be
a lot of trouble,

19:05.813 --> 19:08.847
but when I see him lying
here asleep like this,

19:08.849 --> 19:11.483
I just think...

19:11.485 --> 19:14.720
how easy it would be to
hold a pillow over his face.

19:23.235 --> 19:25.769
Wow, you look like
you got some rest.

19:25.771 --> 19:27.738
Oh, I'm feeling
much better.

19:27.740 --> 19:30.107
And I've also been
continuing to make progress

19:30.109 --> 19:32.943
without artificially
raising my anxiety levels.

19:32.945 --> 19:35.612
I turned on the heat in my car
and some vomit came out,

19:35.614 --> 19:36.981
so my levels--
right up there.

19:36.983 --> 19:38.949
Hey, guys.

19:38.951 --> 19:40.351
Mind if Emily
joins us for lunch?

19:40.353 --> 19:41.652
Yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem.
Of course not.

19:41.654 --> 19:44.588
So I hear you guys have been
playing a little game.

19:44.590 --> 19:47.825
Well, um, we were
just kidding around.

19:47.827 --> 19:50.527
Well, you may think it's funny
that Raj is sweet and sensitive,

19:50.529 --> 19:52.696
but I think it's sexy.

19:56.234 --> 19:58.569
Ugh, why is there dog hair
in your mouth?
