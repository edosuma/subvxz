WEBVTT

00:03.733 --> 00:05.967
- WILL YOU COME ON?
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.800
EVERY TIME.

00:09.833 --> 00:11.033
- COMING.

00:11.067 --> 00:12.700
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA MISS THIS GAME

00:12.733 --> 00:17.800
JUST TO GO TO SOME STUPID
SCHOOL PARENTS' NIGHT.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.033
- YOU THINK I WANT TO?

00:19.067 --> 00:23.033
I JUST WANT TO GO,
SO I CAN GET BACK.

00:23.067 --> 00:27.167
- YOU ARE SOME
SPECIAL KIND OF LADY.

00:28.867 --> 00:30.333
- WILL YOU COME ON?

00:30.367 --> 00:31.500
- HERE YOU GO, BOYS.

00:31.533 --> 00:34.367
- WHAT'S THAT?
- JUST SOME SNACKS.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.033
- OH, THOSE ARE YOUR CALZONES,
YOUR HOMEMADE CALZONES.

00:37.067 --> 00:40.167
AWW.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.367
STUPID PARENT NIGHT.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.600
- RELAX, RAYMOND.
I'LL SAVE YOU SOME.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.733
AND THEN WE'LL DANCE AROUND
IN FAIRY LAND.

00:55.733 --> 00:58.100
- THE CHEESE IS BURNING
THE INSIDE OF YOUR MOUTH,

00:58.133 --> 00:59.200
ISN'T IT?

00:59.233 --> 01:02.433
- I DON'T CARE.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.567
- OH,
DID YOU DO THAT YOURSELF?

01:15.767 --> 01:16.900
- THEY'RE COMING.

01:16.933 --> 01:23.067
[dramatic music]

02:18.600 --> 02:19.633
- HEY.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.900
- HEY, CAN WE GO?
- NO, WAIT A MINUTE. COME HERE.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.600
I HAVE SUCH GREAT DIRT.
COME HERE.

02:23.633 --> 02:24.900
- WHAT?

02:24.933 --> 02:26.300
- YOU KNOW CHERYL KALER?

02:26.333 --> 02:29.467
- NO.
- WE'RE AT HER HOUSE, RAY.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.800
- OH.

02:30.833 --> 02:32.900
- SO SHE'S SHOWING ME AROUND
UPSTAIRS, RIGHT?

02:32.933 --> 02:33.900
AND I SAY HOW GREAT
SHE LOOKS.

02:33.933 --> 02:35.267
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK
SHE LOOKED THAT GREAT,

02:35.300 --> 02:36.700
BUT SHE WAS WEARING
THIS TIGHT PINK OUTFIT.

02:36.733 --> 02:39.767
SO ANYWAY, SHE SAYS, "WELL,
I HAD A LITTLE WORK DONE."

02:39.800 --> 02:40.700
AND I SAID, "OH?"

02:40.733 --> 02:42.767
AND SHE SAYS,
"YEAH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"

02:42.800 --> 02:44.033
AND SHE GOES LIKE THIS.

02:44.067 --> 02:47.667
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- NO.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.733
THEN SHE SHUTS THE DOOR,
AND SHE LIFTS UP HER BLOUSE.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.333
- WHAT?

02:52.367 --> 02:55.733
OHH.
WELL, WHERE THE HELL WAS I?

02:57.733 --> 03:00.133
- SO I WAS JUST LIKE,
I SAID, "WOW."

03:00.167 --> 03:01.833
AND SHE SAYS,
"THEY ARE SO NATURAL.

03:01.867 --> 03:03.533
GO AHEAD.
TOUCH."

03:03.567 --> 03:06.867
- [gasps]

03:06.900 --> 03:09.867
SHE WANTS YOU.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.067
- I MEAN, SHE WAS, LIKE,
ACTING ALL PROUD, YOU KNOW?

03:12.100 --> 03:13.433
AND SHE TELLS ME
THE WHOLE STORY,

03:13.467 --> 03:14.667
HOW SHE DROPS THE KIDS OFF
AT SCHOOL.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.100
SHE HAS IT DONE IN THE MORNING;
SHE'S HOME IN THE AFTERNOON.

03:17.133 --> 03:18.667
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.767
- YEAH, UNBELIEVABLE.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.500
I'M DOWN HERE EATING
BOWLS OF CRAP, AND YOU GET...

03:23.533 --> 03:26.533
YOU GET
"COME IN, TOKYO."

03:26.567 --> 03:28.067
- WELL, THAT'S YOUR FAULT.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.933
- THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
WHICH ONE IS SHE?

03:29.967 --> 03:30.933
- NEVER MIND.
WE GOT TO GO.

03:30.967 --> 03:32.733
'CAUSE I TOLD YOUR MOM
WE'D BE HOME BY 10:00.

03:32.767 --> 03:33.733
- WELL, NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.700
- I'LL GET MY PURSE.

03:35.733 --> 03:37.067
- COME ON.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.767
NO,
I'M AN INVOLVED PARENT HERE.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.300
- OH, HI...RAY.

03:58.333 --> 04:00.733
- HI. YOU MUST BE CHERYL.

04:00.767 --> 04:02.533
- YES.
- YEAH.

04:02.567 --> 04:03.467
- HAVE WE MET?

04:03.500 --> 04:05.400
- NO, NO.
NO, WE HAVEN'T, NO.

04:05.433 --> 04:07.333
NOT UNTIL RIGHT NOW.
YEAH. YEAH.

04:07.367 --> 04:09.433
IT'S A GREAT PARTY, THOUGH.
YEAH.

04:09.467 --> 04:12.633
[clears throat]
THESE ARE GOOD.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.800
- HEY.
- HEY, RAY, YOU MISSED IT.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.267
PHENOMENAL GAME.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.767
WELL, BUT AT LEAST I SAVED YOU
SOME CALZO--

04:31.800 --> 04:34.633
AWW.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.167
SORRY.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.000
- THAT'S OKAY.
I DON'T CARE.

04:39.033 --> 04:40.733
- SO HOW WAS YOUR PARTY, DEAR?

04:40.767 --> 04:41.900
- WELL, IT STARTED OUT SLOW,

04:41.933 --> 04:46.133
BUT THEN IT TURNED OUT TO BE
THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

04:46.167 --> 04:47.233
- COME ON.

04:47.267 --> 04:48.233
- TELL 'EM WHAT YOU SAW.

04:48.267 --> 04:52.733
- NOTHING.
- TELL 'EM.

04:52.767 --> 04:56.900
- ONE OF THE MOTHERS IN ALLY'S
CLASS HAD BREAST IMPLANTS.

04:56.933 --> 04:59.367
- OH, I DON'T LIKE THAT.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.533
- AND AT THE PARTY,
SHE SHOWED 'EM TO ME.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.233
- WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:04.267 --> 05:05.867
- WAIT A MINUTE.
- SHE JUST SHOWED YOU?

05:05.900 --> 05:07.233
- BOTH OF THEM?
- SHIRT ON OR OFF?

05:07.267 --> 05:09.233
- WITH A BRASSIERE?
- WHAT WERE YOU WEARING?

05:09.267 --> 05:13.233
- ALL VALID QUESTIONS.

05:13.267 --> 05:15.000
- WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU GUYS?

05:15.033 --> 05:17.133
COME ON.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

05:17.167 --> 05:18.433
GOOD GRIEF.

05:18.467 --> 05:20.233
WHAT'S THE BIG FRIGGIN' DEAL?

05:20.267 --> 05:21.300
SHE TOUCHED 'EM.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.600
- OH, COME ON.
COME ON.

05:23.633 --> 05:25.433
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:25.467 --> 05:27.433
- SEE, I EXPECT THIS
FROM FRANK,

05:27.467 --> 05:29.000
BUT YOU BOYS HAVE NO REASON

05:29.033 --> 05:31.700
TO HAVE ANY INTEREST
IN SUCH THINGS.

05:31.733 --> 05:32.900
- WHY NOT?

05:32.933 --> 05:36.600
- BECAUSE I NEVER NURSED THEM.

05:36.633 --> 05:40.833
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:40.867 --> 05:44.200
- EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT IF YOU BREAST-FEED BOYS

05:44.233 --> 05:45.400
WHEN THEY'RE BABIES,

05:45.433 --> 05:50.567
THEY'RE GONNA GROW UP TO BE
OBSESSED WITH BREASTS.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.433
- THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T
BREAST-FEED ME?

05:53.467 --> 05:58.400
- THAT, AND THE TWO OF YOU
WERE ALMOST THE SAME HEIGHT.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.667
WE WERE GETTING LOOKS.

06:05.700 --> 06:08.567
- OH, DEBRA, DEAR,

06:08.600 --> 06:11.133
I'M CURIOUS.

06:11.167 --> 06:12.167
WHAT WERE THEY LIKE?

06:12.200 --> 06:13.933
- UGH. THEY WERE TOTALLY FAKE.

06:13.967 --> 06:17.033
- WELL, WELL, GO ON.
I MEAN, THEY WEREN'T FAKE.

06:17.067 --> 06:19.600
THEY WERE REAL.
THEY DO EXIST, YOU KNOW.

06:19.633 --> 06:22.000
IF THEY FELL DOWN
IN A FOREST,

06:22.033 --> 06:25.167
THEY'D MAKE A SOUND.

06:31.767 --> 06:34.733
- WELL, I THINK IT'S SAD WHEN
PEOPLE START HAVING SURGERY

06:34.767 --> 06:36.033
TO MAKE THEMSELVES BIGGER.

06:36.067 --> 06:41.267
- MARIE DID IT THE NATURAL WAY.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.533
POUND CAKE.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.500
- I AGREE WITH MARIE.

06:54.533 --> 06:57.567
I THINK A BOOB JOB IS
A TOTALLY STUPID PROCEDURE.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.933
- BUT FANTASTIC
WHEN DONE PROPERLY.

07:01.967 --> 07:04.000
- [laughing]

07:11.033 --> 07:13.767
OHH. WHOO, BOY.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.333
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN

07:15.367 --> 07:19.333
AFTER THAT LOOK
YOU GAVE ME DOWNSTAIRS.

07:19.367 --> 07:21.333
- WELL, A RULE IS A RULE.

07:21.367 --> 07:23.333
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING
ON THE ROAD FOR A WEEK.

07:23.367 --> 07:27.467
YOU GOT TO GET
THE PROPER SEND-OFF.

07:27.500 --> 07:31.167
- NOTHING PROPER ABOUT
WHAT YOU JUST DID, YOUNG LADY.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.100
- MMM...

07:36.133 --> 07:37.767
SO, RAY...

07:37.800 --> 07:40.433
YOU DON'T THINK I NEED
A BOOB JOB, DO YOU?

07:40.467 --> 07:42.867
- NO.

07:42.900 --> 07:46.033
NOT IF YOU THINK
IT'S STUPID.

07:48.433 --> 07:50.833
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

07:50.867 --> 07:53.467
- WHAT? NOTHING.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.133
- REALLY?

07:55.167 --> 07:57.767
- HEY, YOU KNOW I LIKE THEM.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.333
- YEAH.
OKAY, RAY, OKAY.

07:59.367 --> 08:00.900
- COME ON.
- ALL RIGHT.

08:00.933 --> 08:05.567
- YOU KNOW I LOVE
BARNES & NOBLE.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.233
COME ON.

08:08.267 --> 08:10.100
COME ON.
- IT'S FINE, RAY.

08:10.133 --> 08:11.533
IT'S JUST FINE.

08:11.567 --> 08:12.333
- I LOVE THEM.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.633
- YEAH.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.933
- I ALWAYS LOVED THEM.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:14.967 --> 08:16.767
- HEY, I'LL WRITE 'EM A POEM.
- NO, THANK YOU.

08:16.800 --> 08:17.867
NO, THANK YOU.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.200
- I THINK
THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE--

08:19.233 --> 08:21.233
- OKAY, YES.
THANKS. FORGET IT.

08:21.267 --> 08:24.400
- DON'T GET MAD.
I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY THAT.

08:24.433 --> 08:26.700
I SAY A LOT OF STUFF.
YOU SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

08:26.733 --> 08:28.567
USUALLY, YOU DON'T.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.100
- I KNOW.
FORGET IT. FORGET IT.

08:30.133 --> 08:31.833
IT'S STUPID. FORGET IT.

08:31.867 --> 08:33.600
GOOD NIGHT.

08:33.633 --> 08:37.767
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.767
- HEY, NICKEL, I'M BACK.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.800
DEB.

09:06.833 --> 09:09.333
- YEAH, HI, HONEY.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

09:09.367 --> 09:11.867

09:11.900 --> 09:13.700

09:13.733 --> 09:14.767

09:14.800 --> 09:17.067
- HEY.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.233

09:18.267 --> 09:20.700

09:30.267 --> 09:33.233
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT GAME IS ON?

09:33.267 --> 09:37.533
- SEATTLE, TAMPA BAY.
DAD'S GIVING ME 7 1/2.

09:37.567 --> 09:38.800
- WHEN ARE
ONE OF YOU GUYS GONNA GET

09:38.833 --> 09:40.133
YOUR OWN SATELLITE DISH?

09:40.167 --> 09:44.067
- SHUT UP.

09:44.100 --> 09:47.233
- SORRY THAT TOOK SO LONG.

09:50.933 --> 09:52.100
OH.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.367
HI, GUYS.

10:03.133 --> 10:04.367
IT'S JUST THAT
GEOFFREY WAS HAVING

10:04.400 --> 10:06.067
THAT HUMPTY-DUMPTY DREAM
AGAIN--

10:06.100 --> 10:08.267
YOU KNOW, ALL THE KING'S HORSES
AND ALL THE KING'S MEN

10:08.300 --> 10:10.433
COULDN'T PUT
DADA-DA-DADA-DA-DA, YOU KNOW.

10:10.467 --> 10:11.633
HE JUST HAS A REAL HARD TIME
WITH THAT ONE.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.100
I THINK THAT'S WHY
HE WON'T EAT EGGS, SO...

10:14.133 --> 10:15.333
HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?

10:19.767 --> 10:20.800
WHAT?

10:20.833 --> 10:23.633
- NOTHING, NOTHING.

10:23.667 --> 10:27.200
NEW HAIRCUT?

10:27.233 --> 10:30.667
- NO. I AM USING A NEW
CONDITIONER, THOUGH.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.933
- LOOKS NICE.

10:32.967 --> 10:34.733
ADDS BODY.

10:36.433 --> 10:39.167
- LOOK, DEBRA AND I
GOT TO TALK, OKAY?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.667
SO GO AWAY.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.567
- NO.

10:44.933 --> 10:47.467
- COME ON, LOOK,
I JUST GOT HOME,

10:47.500 --> 10:49.167
AND I'M AWFULLY TIRED HERE,
OKAY?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.333
- WE'RE WATCHING THE GAME.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.667
- RAYMOND, DEAR, OHH...

10:56.700 --> 10:59.433
OOH, YOU MUST BE FAMISHED
FROM YOUR TRIP,

10:59.467 --> 11:04.267
SO I BROUGHT YOU
SOME RAVIO...LI.

11:04.300 --> 11:08.733
I--I'LL JUST GO
WARM THIS UP.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.567
- I'LL TAKE IT, MA.
THANKS.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.733
- YOU KNOW, DEAR,
I'M THINKING

11:16.767 --> 11:20.600
MAYBE YOU USE
THE WRONG SETTING ON YOUR DRYER.

11:20.633 --> 11:22.300
- LOOK,
ALL RIGHT.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.867
LISTEN, GUYS,
I'M REALLY TIRED.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.100
I'M TIRED HERE,
AND DEBRA AND I,

11:26.133 --> 11:27.367
WE GOT A LOT
OF CATCHING UP TO DO,

11:27.400 --> 11:30.167
SO IF YOU'D ALL BE
SO KIND AS TO LEAVE NOW,

11:30.200 --> 11:33.533
I'LL GIVE YOU EACH $1,000.

11:37.267 --> 11:39.733
- NO.
- OH, COME ON. COME ON.

11:39.767 --> 11:43.133
COME ON.
OH, FRANK.

11:43.167 --> 11:44.867
STOP IT.
COME ON, STOP IT.

11:44.900 --> 11:45.867
COME ON. COME ON.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.400
THIS IS
NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

11:52.800 --> 11:57.567
- RAYMOND GETS EVERYTHING.

12:05.867 --> 12:10.133
- I KIND OF WANTED YOU TO BE
THE FIRST ONE TO SEE.

12:10.167 --> 12:11.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:11.533 --> 12:14.100
- I THINK...

12:14.133 --> 12:15.700
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

12:15.733 --> 12:17.733
YOU DIDN'T REALLY...

12:17.767 --> 12:20.267
I WAS GONE A WEEK.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.567
- YOU LIKE 'EM?

12:21.600 --> 12:24.533
- I--I--I...

12:27.167 --> 12:28.333
LET ME SEE.

12:28.367 --> 12:29.767
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.733
I MEAN, NOT HERE.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.200
DO YOU WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS?

12:34.933 --> 12:37.633
- DO I?

12:37.667 --> 12:39.667
- I THINK YOU DO.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.400
- I THINK I DO.
- OKAY.

12:42.433 --> 12:45.267
I'M JUST GONNA BRUSH MY TEETH.

12:51.233 --> 12:54.367
- I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.

13:04.333 --> 13:07.133
WELL, HOW'S IT GOING
IN THERE?

13:07.167 --> 13:09.533
- I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

13:09.567 --> 13:12.867
[gargling]

13:12.900 --> 13:13.867
[spits]

13:13.900 --> 13:17.067
- OKAY.

13:30.667 --> 13:34.133
[sniffs]

13:55.700 --> 13:57.000
HOW YOU DOIN'?

13:57.033 --> 14:00.333
- FINE.

14:08.300 --> 14:12.067
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT REALLY
POLITE TO STARE, RAY.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.700
- SORRY.
IT'S JUST..

14:15.733 --> 14:18.500
WHAT DID YOU DO?

14:18.533 --> 14:21.733
- I, UH, MADE
SOME IMPROVEMENTS,

14:21.767 --> 14:23.267
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:24.933 --> 14:26.033
- REALLY?

14:26.067 --> 14:27.967
YOU...REALLY?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.900
I--I...
THIS IS JUST...

14:30.933 --> 14:32.633
YOU KNOW...

14:32.667 --> 14:35.200
ONE TIME, I WENT ON THE ROAD,
AND I CAME BACK;

14:35.233 --> 14:38.367
YOU HAD THE DRIVEWAY SEALED.

14:45.300 --> 14:49.733
I GOT A LITTLE TURNED ON
WHEN I SAW THAT.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.933
BUT THIS IS...

14:51.967 --> 14:54.133
BETTER.

14:54.167 --> 14:55.500
- IT IS BETTER...

14:55.533 --> 14:56.900
'CAUSE YOU COULDN'T
USE THE DRIVEWAY

14:56.933 --> 14:59.000
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

14:59.033 --> 15:00.933
- HEH-HEH-HEH.

15:00.967 --> 15:04.867
OH, MY GOD.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.767
- SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.533
- OKAY?

15:09.567 --> 15:12.100
- I MEAN, IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU
THAT I LOOK DIFFERENT?

15:12.133 --> 15:13.433
- HEY, LOOK,
IF IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU,

15:13.467 --> 15:16.500
THEN WHO AM I TO SAY,
REALLY?

15:16.533 --> 15:18.900
WHATEVER--WHAT YOU DO
WITH YOUR BODY,

15:18.933 --> 15:20.167
THAT'S YOUR CHOICE,

15:20.200 --> 15:24.100
AND I THINK THAT YOU MADE
TWO EXCELLENT CHOICES.

15:27.433 --> 15:28.633
- YOU'RE HAPPY, RIGHT?

15:28.667 --> 15:31.200
- I JUST...
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

15:31.233 --> 15:32.267
- AH-AH-AH-AH.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.167
- WHAT? OH.
ARE THEY STILL TENDER?

15:34.200 --> 15:36.033
'CAUSE I CAN BE GENTLE.

15:36.067 --> 15:38.600
- OKAY.

15:39.733 --> 15:40.500
WANT TO SEE 'EM?

15:40.533 --> 15:43.400
- OH...YOU WANT
TO SHOW 'EM TO ME.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.300
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO BACK UP.

15:45.333 --> 15:48.467
- HEH,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO BACK UP.

16:07.933 --> 16:10.867
- IDIOT.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.533
- SOCKS?
- YOU ARE A JERK.

16:12.567 --> 16:13.500
- WHAT?

16:13.533 --> 16:14.700
- YOU'RE REALLY DISAPPOINTED
NOW, AREN'T YOU?

16:14.733 --> 16:17.633
- I'M NOT...DISAPPOINTED.
I'M SCARED.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.367
- WHAT DID YOU THINK,

16:22.400 --> 16:25.000
THAT I WAS GONNA HAVE
PLASTIC SURGERY FOR YOU?

16:25.033 --> 16:27.533
- YEAH--WELL,
WHAT DO YOU--NO.

16:27.567 --> 16:28.500
YOU SAID YOU DID.

16:28.533 --> 16:30.967
- I DID NOT.
YOU JUST WANTED ME TO SO BADLY.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.500
- WHAT?
WHEN DID I SAY THAT?

16:32.533 --> 16:33.933
- THE NIGHT
OF THE PARENTS THING.

16:33.967 --> 16:35.000
- WHAT? WHAT'D I SAY?

16:35.033 --> 16:36.300
- I ASKED YOU, "DO YOU THINK
I NEED A BOOB JOB?"

16:36.333 --> 16:38.267
AND YOU SAID, "NOT IF
YOU THINK IT'S STUPID."

16:38.300 --> 16:39.633
- OKAY, SO WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

16:39.667 --> 16:40.767
- "NOT IF YOU THINK
IT'S STUPID"?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.333
THAT MEANS YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S STUPID.

16:42.367 --> 16:47.067
AND YOU JUST SAID,
"TWO EXCELLENT CHOICES."

16:47.100 --> 16:49.267
- I THOUGHT
THAT YOU HAD SURGERY.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.300
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING
SUPPORTIVE, THAT'S ALL.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.167
WHAT, DO YOU WANT
TO COME BACK FROM SURGERY

16:53.200 --> 16:56.233
AND HAVE ME GO, "EHHHH"?

16:56.267 --> 16:58.067
- WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE SAID WAS,

16:58.100 --> 17:00.300
"I LOVE YOUR BODY
THE WAY IT IS,

17:00.333 --> 17:02.467
AND YOU SHOULDN'T CHANGE IT
EVER."

17:02.500 --> 17:03.733
- I DO LOVE YOUR BODY
THE WAY IT IS.

17:03.767 --> 17:04.833
- OH, BALONEY.

17:04.867 --> 17:06.233
ALL I HAD TO DO IS STUFF
A COUPLE OF SOCKS IN THERE,

17:06.267 --> 17:10.267
AND YOU'RE HYPERVENTILATING.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.767
- THAT'S ENTRAPMENT.
- IT IS NOT.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.000
- YES, OF COURSE IT IS.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.200
YOU'RE WALKING AROUND LIKE...

17:14.233 --> 17:17.800
- OH, I DIDN'T DO THAT.
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

17:17.833 --> 17:18.767
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.600
- OH, THEN WHAT DID YOU DO?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

17:20.633 --> 17:22.367
SEEMS LIKE YOU WENT
TO A LOT OF TROUBLE

17:22.400 --> 17:23.900
JUST TO GET ME TO SAY
THAT I LIKE BREASTS.

17:23.933 --> 17:25.033
- BIG BREASTS.

17:25.067 --> 17:27.200
- YEAH.

17:27.233 --> 17:30.500
YEAH, OKAY,
AND A NICE BUTT TOO. HUH?

17:30.533 --> 17:33.600
I'M SICK.

17:33.633 --> 17:34.700
YOU KNOW WHEN
YOU SHOULD START WORRYING

17:34.733 --> 17:36.433
IS WHEN I SAY I DON'T LIKE
THOSE THINGS.

17:36.467 --> 17:38.400
- YOU ARE OBSESSED
WITH THOSE THINGS.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.733
- I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO HAD FAKE SURGERY.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.133
- AND ALL THOSE TIMES YOU SAY,
"HEY, YOU LOOK GREAT,"

17:42.167 --> 17:43.167
IT WAS ALL LIES.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.567
- OH, COME ON.
I MEAN IT WHEN I SAY THAT.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.467
ALL RIGHT, SOMETIMES I MEAN,
"HURRY UP; WE'RE LATE."

17:47.500 --> 17:49.867
BUT USUALLY,
I MEAN YOU LOOK GREAT.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.033
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
- IT'S TRUE.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.067
YOU ALWAYS LOOK GREAT.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.633
IT'S JUST TONIGHT
YOU LOOKED DIFFERENT GREAT.

17:53.667 --> 17:56.933
- OH, GOD, I AM SO SICK OF
THIS JUVENILE PREOCCUPATION

17:56.967 --> 18:02.067
WITH BOOB SIZE AND PERKINESS
AND CLEAVAGE AND...

18:02.100 --> 18:06.067
I'VE HAD THREE KIDS, YOU KNOW?

18:06.100 --> 18:07.733
THESE ARE NOT JUST FOR SHOW.

18:07.767 --> 18:10.733
THESE WERE WORKING BREASTS.

18:20.600 --> 18:25.033
- COME ON, HONEY.

18:25.067 --> 18:26.333
AW, COME ON.

18:26.367 --> 18:29.433
YOU SAY THAT
LIKE THEY'RE RETIRED.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.467
THEY'RE STILL USEFUL.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.933
THEY CAN DO SOME
OCCASIONAL CONSULTING WORK.

18:38.967 --> 18:39.967
- FORGET IT.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.400
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
REALLY LIKE NOW.

18:42.433 --> 18:43.800
- OH...

18:43.833 --> 18:46.767
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

18:51.433 --> 18:53.933
- I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY
LOOKS ARE SO IMPORTANT.

18:53.967 --> 18:57.100
I DON'T CARE HOW YOU LOOK.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.600
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:05.633 --> 19:07.567
- NOTHING.
- NO, NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.433
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:08.467 --> 19:09.433
I MEAN, YOU ALWAYS
USED TO SAY THAT,

19:09.467 --> 19:11.933
"OH, YOU'RE SO CUTE."

19:11.967 --> 19:13.367
I'M STILL CUTE, RIGHT?

19:13.400 --> 19:16.000
- RAY, YOUR BEING CUTE
HAS NOTHING TO DO

19:16.033 --> 19:17.533
WITH YOUR APPEARANCE.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.500
- THEN WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

19:21.533 --> 19:23.833
- OH, NOTHING.
I JUST MEANT, YOU KNOW,

19:23.867 --> 19:26.767
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'VE GONE,
LIKE, SOFT IN THE MIDDLE

19:26.800 --> 19:28.500
OR YOUR HAIRLINE'S RECEDING

19:28.533 --> 19:33.200
AND YOU HAVE THIS CONCAVE ASS.

19:33.233 --> 19:35.000
CUTE IS JUST WHO YOU ARE.

19:35.033 --> 19:37.467
- CONCAVE?

19:37.500 --> 19:42.300
HEY, YOU KNOW,
THESE JEANS ARE RELAXED-FIT.

19:42.333 --> 19:45.467
IF THEY WERE REGULAR,
MY ASS WOULD COME ALIVE.

19:52.033 --> 19:53.567
- I DON'T NEED IT ALIVE.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.700
I'M FINE
WITH THE WAY YOU LOOK.

19:55.733 --> 19:56.567
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

19:56.600 --> 20:00.500
- RAY, I HAPPEN
TO LOVE YOU FOR YOU.

20:03.833 --> 20:07.167
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
I WANT TO BE A HOTTIE.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.467
- SO DID I.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.567
- YEAH, WELL...

20:15.600 --> 20:18.933
YOU'RE A HOTTIE
EVEN WITHOUT...THE SOCKS.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.333
- OHH.

20:21.367 --> 20:24.933
OH, YOU SAID
I DIDN'T NEED SOCKS.

20:24.967 --> 20:27.100
- ALL RIGHT.

20:27.133 --> 20:29.567
I LIKE YOU
AND YOUR BREASTS.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.233
- AND I LIKE YOU
AND YOUR BREASTS.

20:32.267 --> 20:34.267
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.533
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DID YOU SAY "BREASTS" FOR?

20:36.567 --> 20:37.667
- 'CAUSE YOU JUST SAID IT.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.500
- YEAH, WELL, YOU HAVE BREASTS.
I DON'T HAVE BREASTS.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.433
- PECS.
I MEANT TO SAY PECS.

20:41.467 --> 20:43.000
- I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID,
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.667
YOU MEANT
MY SAGGING BREASTS.

20:45.700 --> 20:50.167
I'VE HAD THREE KIDS TOO,
YOU KNOW.

21:47.667 --> 21:49.000
- YOU WANT MY SOCKS?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.867
- IT'S NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.100
I SAW A MOUSE.
