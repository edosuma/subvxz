WEBVTT

00:40.931 --> 00:42.767
Looks like mom
has been here...

00:44.034 --> 00:46.037
always with the expected.

01:07.056 --> 01:08.425
Seems like it was just

01:08.459 --> 01:10.026
the last day of third grade

01:10.059 --> 01:13.731
when we started
our tradition of ice cream

01:13.763 --> 01:15.198
and a trip to the museum.

01:17.701 --> 01:20.971
How crazy that it's
the last day of tenth

01:21.005 --> 01:24.208
and you aren't here.

01:25.776 --> 01:27.144
How are you?

01:28.645 --> 01:32.049
Kind of an unusual spot.

01:32.082 --> 01:35.786
Or do you spend
a lot of time in cemeteries?

01:37.153 --> 01:38.688
Yeah.

01:38.722 --> 01:41.659
Dead people don't ask you
how you're doing all the time.

02:06.216 --> 02:09.018
Anyway,
sounds like I'm off to Mimi

02:09.051 --> 02:11.021
and Papa's
for the summer.

02:12.856 --> 02:15.760
I would rather be anywhere else.

02:25.001 --> 02:28.071
I can't believe I won't be able
to visit you every day.

04:21.450 --> 04:23.419
Yeah, it's totally
not creepy

04:23.452 --> 04:25.187
that you're just sitting here
all by yourself

04:25.221 --> 04:27.757
staring at everyone.

04:27.791 --> 04:29.125
Wanna join us?

04:30.793 --> 04:32.262
Come on!

04:35.298 --> 04:37.034
Molly's
trying so hard

04:37.067 --> 04:40.002
to include me... and, no,

04:40.036 --> 04:42.139
I still have nothing in common

04:42.171 --> 04:44.808
with Shelley and the Karens,

04:44.841 --> 04:47.611
even though we've been
in school together forever.

04:47.644 --> 04:49.245
Hey, kids.
What's the latest?

04:49.279 --> 04:52.382
We were just discussing our
fabulous summer plans.

04:52.416 --> 04:54.317
Joey,
does your family still go

04:54.351 --> 04:55.786
to the San River every summer?

04:55.819 --> 04:57.754
Oh, my mom's
on this book tour this year,

04:57.786 --> 04:59.222
so we probably won't make it.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.291
So, you're just going to hang
out with your pops then?

05:01.325 --> 05:02.659
Shut up, Shelley!

05:03.993 --> 05:08.332
No, I'm the girl
whose dad died, remember?

05:10.466 --> 05:13.002
So, you're really going
to abandon me this summer?

05:13.036 --> 05:14.838
Marissa is the one
abandoning me

05:14.870 --> 05:16.139
for her stupid book tour.

05:16.173 --> 05:18.743
My dad's body is practically
still warm.

05:20.010 --> 05:22.312
- Too dark?
- A little.

05:22.346 --> 05:26.884
Hey, congrats
on those stellar PSAT scores!

05:26.916 --> 05:28.184
You'll be writing your own
ticket to college

05:28.217 --> 05:30.620
- if you keep that chiz up.
- Thank you, Mr. Gately.

05:30.654 --> 05:32.822
You guys joining the other
kids for the big tailgater?

05:32.856 --> 05:34.057
Yeah, I'm not really

05:34.091 --> 05:36.327
in the mood for date rape
tonight, so...

05:37.861 --> 05:39.296
Okay, well,
have a great summer.

05:39.329 --> 05:42.299
Thanks, Mr. Gately.
Too dark?

05:44.300 --> 05:47.671
So, you're going to the party
with me tonight?

05:47.704 --> 05:49.105
You are the worst
best friend ever.

05:49.139 --> 05:50.373
You're gonna
love me for it.

05:50.406 --> 05:52.675
Aaron's gonna be there,
and he and I are, like,

05:52.709 --> 05:54.310
meant to be together forever.

05:54.344 --> 05:57.380
I wouldn't want
to interfere with destiny.

05:57.413 --> 06:00.116
- See you later.
- Right. Bye.

06:03.353 --> 06:06.122
Like you said,
the best day of school

06:06.156 --> 06:08.259
is the last day of school.

06:14.365 --> 06:16.433
Not exactly thrilled

06:16.466 --> 06:19.336
to be hanging out with the old
folks this summer,

06:19.368 --> 06:22.672
but at least I won't be here.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.218
Mom?

06:36.385 --> 06:37.987
Marissa?

06:47.430 --> 06:48.666
Is there a dinner?

06:48.699 --> 06:51.168
Dinner? Right.
Um, Pizza?

06:52.902 --> 06:55.104
- Again?
- No dishes.

06:55.137 --> 06:57.007
I really want to come home
to a clean house.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.009
Great!
I'm not hungry.

06:59.041 --> 07:01.212
- Are you packed?
- Thinking about it.

07:11.255 --> 07:13.055
Anything else?

07:13.089 --> 07:14.892
I put a fresh bouquet
on Daddy's grave today.

07:14.925 --> 07:16.026
I know.

07:18.327 --> 07:20.029
Oh, you took
the flowers out of the vase?

07:20.063 --> 07:21.230
Is that a problem?

07:21.264 --> 07:22.733
Well, they won't
last as long.

07:22.765 --> 07:23.900
If you wanted
them to last long,

07:23.933 --> 07:25.668
you wouldn't have cut them.

07:25.702 --> 07:26.969
Well, we're not going
to be here

07:27.003 --> 07:28.037
to enjoy them this summer.

07:28.070 --> 07:29.805
So, I thought Daddy
might like them.

07:29.839 --> 07:31.875
As if Daddy
can even see them.

07:34.978 --> 07:36.781
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

07:38.882 --> 07:40.283
Well, what are
you looking for?

07:40.317 --> 07:41.952
Sweatshirt.

07:41.985 --> 07:44.221
Molly and I are going
out tonight.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.089
When are you going
to be home?

07:46.123 --> 07:49.692
The question isn't when,
dear Carissa, it's if.

07:57.767 --> 08:00.136
Oh, my God.
He's coming over here.

08:00.170 --> 08:03.273
Act like I just said something
really funny.

08:03.307 --> 08:04.674
I know, right?

08:04.707 --> 08:06.844
Hi Molly,
having a good night?

08:06.877 --> 08:09.146
Hi Aaron.
You know Joey, right?

08:09.178 --> 08:11.347
Yeah.
We had chem together, right?

08:11.380 --> 08:13.082
I'm surprised
you remember.

08:13.115 --> 08:14.952
You never said
a single word to me.

08:19.022 --> 08:21.425
So, who wants a drink?

08:21.457 --> 08:23.392
I'd love one, thanks.

08:23.425 --> 08:25.795
Okay.

08:25.829 --> 08:27.364
BRB.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.834
- Better stay right there.
- I promise I won't leave.

08:31.767 --> 08:33.803
Is this seat taken?

08:33.836 --> 08:35.904
Yeah, Molly's
coming right back.

08:35.938 --> 08:37.107
Are you sure about that?

08:37.140 --> 08:38.741
To the best summer ever.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.044
You know,
You're not the only one

08:42.078 --> 08:43.880
who doesn't like
coming at these.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.815
Do I fill my nose?

08:45.849 --> 08:47.917
Yeah,
they look miserable.

08:51.220 --> 08:54.156
Aaron,
this is a total no-fun zone,

08:54.190 --> 08:56.093
- come back to the party!
- All right.

08:57.426 --> 08:59.195
Sorry about your dad, Joey.

09:04.968 --> 09:06.770
Peace out, bitches.

09:16.646 --> 09:18.248
Joey, stop that.

09:19.248 --> 09:20.315
What will people think?

09:20.349 --> 09:22.185
Dad would have
thought that was funny.

09:31.328 --> 09:32.897
You ready?

09:36.833 --> 09:38.735
Thank you.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.693
Mom? Dad?

10:03.727 --> 10:06.730
You came through my vagina.
You can come through the door.

10:06.762 --> 10:11.133
We discovered juicing.
That's good.

10:11.167 --> 10:13.368
- There my girls!
- Hey Joseph!

10:13.402 --> 10:15.904
- Hi Papa!
- Sweetie!

10:15.939 --> 10:17.674
Power boost
for the road!

10:17.706 --> 10:20.075
Beets, kale
and pinch of psyllium husk.

10:20.108 --> 10:22.046
What? It's good for the colon.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.414
I hope your seated
on the aisle.

10:24.446 --> 10:26.182
So you're coming
with us, Joey?

10:26.215 --> 10:28.417
I'm not a fan
of airport goodbyes.

10:28.450 --> 10:30.954
I'll check in with you
when I get to JFK, all right?

10:34.157 --> 10:35.090
I'm at a loss.

10:35.123 --> 10:37.795
Don't worry,
we'll take good care of her.

10:38.994 --> 10:41.130
She is our favorite
granddaughter after all.

10:41.164 --> 10:43.066
I'm your only
granddaughter.

10:43.099 --> 10:45.134
We'll see you in August
for our 40th?

10:45.167 --> 10:46.803
- That's the plan.
- Okay.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.809
So, who wants to do drugs?

10:52.842 --> 10:53.977
Hot acid.

10:54.009 --> 10:55.344
A little cocaine made.

10:55.377 --> 10:57.046
Maybe I should
settle away

10:57.079 --> 10:58.715
and before you hit
the hard stuff.

11:00.217 --> 11:03.020
You're very reasonable
for a teenager.

11:31.046 --> 11:33.683
- I rule!
- Ugh.

11:35.084 --> 11:36.685
I don't think
I need to play another round

11:36.719 --> 11:39.222
of miniature golf
for quite some time.

11:39.254 --> 11:41.924
You're just sore
'cause I beat you.

11:41.958 --> 11:44.328
Yeah, miniature
golf is pretty lame.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.295
No, actually,
you're quite good.

11:46.329 --> 11:48.764
Give your old Mimi
a run for her money.

11:48.799 --> 11:51.268
You should know
that your grandmother

11:51.300 --> 11:53.970
is the miniature golf
champion of the family.

11:56.305 --> 11:59.575
You guys are cute.
Mom and Dad were just like you.

12:00.810 --> 12:04.012
So, Joey,
you have a boyfriend?

12:04.046 --> 12:06.182
Well, haven't
found the right guy yet?

12:06.215 --> 12:08.817
Oh, Joseph,
maybe she's a lesbian.

12:08.852 --> 12:10.053
That's okay!

12:10.085 --> 12:11.687
A lot of kids are gay
these days.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.656
Jesus, I'm not a lesbian.

12:15.358 --> 12:16.459
Let's go!

12:16.493 --> 12:18.829
You guys are a little too cool,
it's freaking me out.

12:25.167 --> 12:26.935
Good afternoon, Roy.

12:26.969 --> 12:29.439
Hello, Joseph.
Hello, Margaret.

12:29.472 --> 12:30.874
You got your granddaughter?

12:30.906 --> 12:33.743
This is Joey,
stuck with us all summer.

12:33.776 --> 12:34.978
Poor sucker.

12:36.012 --> 12:37.147
Victor is back
with us again.

12:37.180 --> 12:38.882
Who knows how long this time?

12:38.915 --> 12:41.017
But why so glum?

12:41.050 --> 12:42.719
He's gone goth.

12:42.752 --> 12:44.020
Well, I don't
know what that means,

12:44.054 --> 12:45.756
but it doesn't sound good.

12:45.789 --> 12:47.891
We'll see you for cards
tomorrow night?

12:47.924 --> 12:49.693
Looking forward to it.

13:00.070 --> 13:03.006
Joey! Joey!

13:03.040 --> 13:06.009
Grandpa and I are heading
over to the Irelands' for cards.

13:07.209 --> 13:09.211
Hello!

13:09.244 --> 13:11.047
- Hello!
- What?

13:11.080 --> 13:12.648
We play late.

13:12.681 --> 13:14.151
So don't wait up.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.019
Ugh, you crazy kids.

13:16.051 --> 13:18.589
What will I ever do with you?
Whoa!

13:19.388 --> 13:21.358
Oh, okay.
What are you doing?

13:22.959 --> 13:24.861
Why don't you
jump on my bike

13:24.895 --> 13:27.029
and tear through
the neighborhood, okay?

13:27.063 --> 13:28.599
Good girl.

14:09.037 --> 14:10.173
Shit!

14:17.213 --> 14:18.415
Hello, young lady.

14:18.448 --> 14:20.050
- Joey?
- What are you doing here?

14:20.083 --> 14:21.851
Is everything OK?
Where are you going?

14:21.884 --> 14:22.951
Victor, honey!

14:22.985 --> 14:24.287
Someone's here to see you.

14:28.325 --> 14:31.929
Victor, this is
our granddaughter, Joey.

14:31.961 --> 14:33.996
She's spending
the summer with us.

14:34.031 --> 14:35.765
Lucky Joey,

14:35.799 --> 14:39.435
You know you have the coolest
grandparents ever, right?

14:39.469 --> 14:42.671
And your mom's like,
that famous novelist, yeah?

14:42.704 --> 14:44.674
I'm sorry, I thought
I saw something.

14:44.708 --> 14:46.677
I'm leaving now.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.579
Nice to see you,
Joey.

14:49.978 --> 14:51.214
What is it all about?

14:51.247 --> 14:52.649
Good question.

14:56.886 --> 14:58.355
Hey, wait up!

15:05.094 --> 15:07.430
- Wait.
- Okay, I know what I saw.

15:07.464 --> 15:08.698
Your window was open

15:08.732 --> 15:10.199
and pretty music
was blasting out of it,

15:10.233 --> 15:11.633
so It couldn't help but notice.

15:11.666 --> 15:12.935
Next time you attempt suicide,

15:12.969 --> 15:14.371
you might wanna try
turning your lights off!

15:14.403 --> 15:15.972
You liked my music?

15:17.406 --> 15:18.808
What?

15:18.842 --> 15:22.613
The music I was playing,
you said you liked it.

15:24.747 --> 15:27.818
Uh, yeah, it was sad
and beautiful.

15:28.884 --> 15:32.154
Two great tastes
that taste great together.

15:33.222 --> 15:34.790
I'm sorry I scared you.

15:34.824 --> 15:37.359
I was just doing one
of my performance pieces.

15:37.392 --> 15:40.028
A performance?
For who?

15:40.061 --> 15:42.398
For myself. Who else?

15:48.003 --> 15:49.372
What?

15:49.405 --> 15:51.007
Well, I can't come in.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.876
And why not?

15:52.908 --> 15:55.811
A vampire has to be
invited into a mortal's home.

15:55.844 --> 15:57.846
I thought everyone knew that.

15:57.881 --> 16:00.050
OK, whatever.
Just come on in.

16:06.321 --> 16:07.823
Got any beer?

16:09.257 --> 16:10.661
Uh... root beer?

16:13.729 --> 16:15.132
Adorable.

16:18.667 --> 16:23.306
So, if you're a vampire,
shouldn't you be drinking blood?

16:24.239 --> 16:26.975
You know, I'm not
really a vampire.

16:27.009 --> 16:30.780
But don't tell my grandparents,
they're the real vampires.

16:31.748 --> 16:33.081
Wait, I'm not following.

16:33.116 --> 16:36.018
You're not really a vampire,
but your grandparents are?

16:36.051 --> 16:37.086
Imagine
their disappointment

16:37.119 --> 16:39.623
when they find out
I am only a goth.

16:51.001 --> 16:52.334
You wanna make out?

16:52.368 --> 16:54.970
Err, I'm good. Thanks.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.144
What does your room look like?

17:15.959 --> 17:19.095
Wow, so tidy!

17:19.128 --> 17:20.829
You're not a serial killer,
are you?

17:20.863 --> 17:22.766
Because I saw this show

17:22.798 --> 17:25.666
and serial killers tend
to be very clean.

17:25.701 --> 17:27.336
Well, I am not
a serial killer.

17:28.471 --> 17:34.377
Well, I guess I won't know
until it's too late.

17:37.913 --> 17:40.616
Nice. Firm.

17:49.025 --> 17:51.093
Not half bad taste in music.

17:51.126 --> 17:54.729
Um, you are very smug,
you know that, mister?

17:54.764 --> 17:57.132
If by smug
you mean awesome,

17:57.165 --> 17:58.834
you'd be correct, young lady.

18:00.103 --> 18:01.804
Got any pot?

18:01.837 --> 18:03.172
Yeah, right.

18:04.940 --> 18:07.143
Oh, I've never done drugs.

18:08.777 --> 18:10.278
Well...

18:10.313 --> 18:12.783
there's a first time
for everything, isn't there?

18:19.287 --> 18:21.056
Do... do you mind
taking that outside?

18:21.091 --> 18:22.358
I just don't want
my grandparents thinking

18:22.391 --> 18:24.326
I'm some kind of drug addict.

18:27.162 --> 18:30.232
Smoking a little grass
hardly makes you a drug addict.

18:31.299 --> 18:32.368
Here.

18:34.336 --> 18:35.738
Impressive timing.

18:35.770 --> 18:37.206
You know, it's very impolite

18:37.239 --> 18:38.974
to turn down
another person's weed.

18:43.912 --> 18:45.681
Okay.

19:03.699 --> 19:08.671
He looked
at the girl, aimed the pistol...

19:08.703 --> 19:11.307
and fired a bullet through
his right temple.

19:13.843 --> 19:15.745
He freaking shot himself.

19:17.247 --> 19:21.418
Okay wait, so he just
kills himself, and then it ends?

19:21.450 --> 19:22.885
That is so messed up.

19:24.019 --> 19:26.122
We're dying from the moment
we're born, poodle.

19:26.155 --> 19:27.957
It's best that you accept
that now.

19:30.927 --> 19:32.195
Oh, my God.

19:32.228 --> 19:36.364
Is it really that late?
Where are my grandparents?

19:36.399 --> 19:38.635
I'm telling you,
there are vampires over there.

19:40.436 --> 19:44.307
Should we eat some more?

19:45.674 --> 19:47.676
I'm thinking yes.

19:49.078 --> 19:50.680
Great.

19:55.651 --> 19:57.387
Did I scare you?

20:01.190 --> 20:02.792
Good!

20:30.853 --> 20:31.720
We were wondering

20:31.755 --> 20:33.389
when you were gonna
come back to life.

20:33.421 --> 20:34.656
What time is it?

20:34.690 --> 20:36.092
Almost noon.

20:36.124 --> 20:37.826
You kids had fun last night?

20:37.861 --> 20:39.862
I should ask you
two the same thing.

20:39.895 --> 20:40.930
Last time I checked,

20:40.963 --> 20:42.865
it was 2:00AM and you still
hadn't made it home.

20:44.432 --> 20:47.903
Whoa.
Does he do that often?

20:47.937 --> 20:50.306
Do what, dear? What?

20:52.975 --> 20:55.178
Breakfast is served.

20:55.210 --> 20:59.649
Of course, it's almost lunch,
but, what the hell?

20:59.681 --> 21:01.617
Really?
Is the nakedness necessary?

21:01.651 --> 21:04.286
He isn't naked, dear.
He's wearing an apron.

21:07.055 --> 21:10.793
So, what are you doing today?
Any plans?

21:10.826 --> 21:13.696
Victor and I thought that it
would be fun to hang out.

21:23.038 --> 21:25.040
You look really beautiful.

21:25.074 --> 21:26.241
I look really awkward.

21:26.276 --> 21:28.612
But in a really
attractive way.

21:30.145 --> 21:32.614
Oh!

21:32.649 --> 21:36.119
Think of it as an advance
on your inheritance.

21:36.151 --> 21:37.687
Have fun tonight!

21:37.719 --> 21:39.221
Thank you, Papa.

21:53.803 --> 21:56.672
Hi, Mr. Ireland,
uh, is Victor home?

21:56.706 --> 21:58.742
You know, I think
he just went to the coffee shop.

21:59.874 --> 22:01.209
Really?

22:01.242 --> 22:03.645
We were supposed
to hang out together.

22:03.679 --> 22:04.781
He went to get coffee.

22:04.814 --> 22:05.848
He went for coffee.

22:05.882 --> 22:07.283
Are you excited
about the fourth?

22:07.316 --> 22:09.651
I hadn't really thought
about it.

22:09.684 --> 22:11.286
You're an American,
aren't you?

22:11.319 --> 22:12.787
Well,
yes, I'm an American,

22:12.821 --> 22:15.124
but the fourth seems
a little bit far off.

22:15.157 --> 22:18.161
It's around the corner.
I just got back from Tijuana

22:18.193 --> 22:19.828
with this little baby.

22:20.997 --> 22:23.700
Now, if the cops come knocking,
you ain't seen nothing.

22:23.732 --> 22:24.899
Oh, okay.

22:24.933 --> 22:26.969
Well, have a good day,
Mr. and Mrs. Ireland.

22:29.037 --> 22:30.406
Strange girl.

22:31.373 --> 22:35.611
There you are.

22:35.644 --> 22:36.979
Can't talk now, Mom.
Gotta run.

23:11.747 --> 23:13.083
Victor?

23:13.115 --> 23:14.683
Hi, hey, there.

23:14.717 --> 23:16.051
Hey, everyone,
have you met

23:16.084 --> 23:18.254
my new friend, Joey?
Joey, this is Pen,

23:18.286 --> 23:19.988
and this is her boyfriend, Cobb.

23:21.090 --> 23:24.260
Hi. Pen and Cobb
are those nicknames

23:24.294 --> 23:25.227
or something?

23:25.259 --> 23:26.728
Pen is an adult female swan.

23:26.761 --> 23:28.229
Cobb is an adult male swan.

23:28.264 --> 23:30.700
Did you guys know
that swans mate for life?

23:30.732 --> 23:32.667
Course we know that,
don't we, beloved?

23:32.700 --> 23:34.069
Pen and Cobb
have made a blood vow

23:34.103 --> 23:35.371
to be together forever.

23:35.404 --> 23:36.905
See, they have phials
of each other's blood

23:36.939 --> 23:37.940
around their neck.

23:37.973 --> 23:39.208
Isn't that romantic?

23:40.308 --> 23:41.344
Sure.

23:42.878 --> 23:44.947
When he dies, I will take
my own life immediately

23:44.979 --> 23:46.781
and he will do the same for me
if I pass on

23:46.815 --> 23:49.219
to the next world before him.
We'll be together in this life

23:49.251 --> 23:50.385
and in the hereafter.

23:50.420 --> 23:51.621
If there is a hereafter.

23:51.653 --> 23:52.921
Of course,
there is a hereafter.

23:52.955 --> 23:54.424
Positively can't wait
for the hereafter.

23:54.457 --> 23:55.824
But what if we're
already dead?

23:55.857 --> 23:57.192
And this is the hereafter.

23:57.226 --> 24:00.029
I love you exquisitely
twisted mind, you know that?

24:00.063 --> 24:02.232
You ditched
the grandparents this afternoon.

24:02.265 --> 24:05.168
A person can only
play so much canasta, really.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.635
I love canasta.

24:10.105 --> 24:14.809
Victor, can I talk to you
in private for a second?

24:14.843 --> 24:16.146
Sure.

24:23.018 --> 24:24.086
What's up?

24:25.455 --> 24:27.957
It's just that I... I thought
we were gonna hang out,

24:27.990 --> 24:29.758
you know, together.

24:29.792 --> 24:32.161
Jesus, Joey,
I'm really shocked.

24:32.193 --> 24:33.662
We didn't even have sex
last night,

24:33.696 --> 24:35.264
- you're already so possessive.
- No, no.

24:35.297 --> 24:37.032
I mean,
you stalked me all the way here,

24:37.065 --> 24:38.968
and now I hear you give me
a guilt trip about meeting up

24:39.001 --> 24:39.834
with my friends?

24:39.867 --> 24:41.236
I wasn't stalking you,
I just thought

24:41.269 --> 24:44.173
- that we were gonna hang on.
- Joey, relax.

24:44.207 --> 24:45.708
I'm just kidding.

24:45.740 --> 24:46.709
I didn't have your number
in my phone,

24:46.742 --> 24:49.110
so I thought you'd figure out
to meet me here.

24:49.144 --> 24:52.248
But you're really sweet,
you know that, right?

24:57.151 --> 24:58.621
What?

24:58.653 --> 25:02.025
It's just your outfit
is really bringing me down.

25:03.125 --> 25:04.960
It's time to freshen things up
a little bit,

25:04.994 --> 25:08.363
and by "freshen," I mean
change every single thing

25:08.396 --> 25:10.799
about the way you look.

25:13.436 --> 25:14.904
Will this help?

25:16.005 --> 25:18.306
Pen, Cobb,
emergency makeover.

25:26.114 --> 25:28.351
Back off, bitch,
Eliza Doolittle's mine.

25:33.756 --> 25:35.658
You'll be a new woman
once I'm done with you.

25:43.799 --> 25:45.300
She gets really moved
by makeovers.

26:05.421 --> 26:08.757
Just one last thing.

26:08.789 --> 26:10.125
Okay.

26:16.065 --> 26:17.866
Look at this pair of WOBs.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.768
WOBs?

26:19.802 --> 26:22.205
Wearers Of Black,
like you now.

26:23.337 --> 26:26.174
What's a great color
on you ladies! Very slimming.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.376
What the hell!

26:30.011 --> 26:31.079
How's our girl?

26:31.113 --> 26:32.180
We went shopping.

26:32.215 --> 26:34.050
This is no time
for small talk,

26:34.083 --> 26:35.618
your whole life
is about to change.

26:35.651 --> 26:36.952
Thank you.

26:39.955 --> 26:41.824
Should we be worried?

26:41.856 --> 26:44.594
They're teenagers. Yes.

26:45.460 --> 26:49.097
Okay.
Oh, these are nice!

26:49.131 --> 26:52.168
We should dye this.

26:55.270 --> 26:57.039
What do you think?

26:58.207 --> 27:00.008
Utterly lugubrious.

27:00.042 --> 27:01.410
The Utterly Lugubrious.

27:01.442 --> 27:03.145
What do you think of that
for our band name?

27:04.412 --> 27:05.847
Check this out.

27:11.319 --> 27:15.190
Oh, my God, my mom is gonna
kill me.

27:16.758 --> 27:18.728
It's awesome, I love it.

27:20.929 --> 27:22.663
Like this?

27:22.698 --> 27:25.935
- You can do that?
- Oh... Oh, God.

27:27.335 --> 27:30.305
You look like the bride
of Frankenstein.

27:30.338 --> 27:31.806
Hot.

27:31.841 --> 27:33.709
Hey. See you at 8:00?

27:33.741 --> 27:36.778
I don't think
I'm gonna make it tonight.

27:37.979 --> 27:39.848
Close your eye.

27:50.258 --> 27:52.795
You know, there's no going
back now, right?

28:13.114 --> 28:16.651
Wow!
You guys going to a funeral?

28:16.686 --> 28:18.221
Why? Do you happen
to know of any good ones?

28:18.254 --> 28:19.988
We're off
to a party, you guys.

28:20.021 --> 28:23.125
We'll get her home safe.
Promise.

28:26.061 --> 28:29.098
Did you see what
that boy did to our Joey?

28:29.131 --> 28:33.701
Yeah. It finally looks like
she's having some fun.

28:33.735 --> 28:34.737
Uh...

28:37.006 --> 28:38.207
Wait.

28:42.077 --> 28:44.713
I want you...

28:44.747 --> 28:46.615
...to be perfect.

28:52.853 --> 28:54.891
Hey, Joey, give me your phone.

28:55.857 --> 28:57.192
Okay.

28:59.428 --> 29:02.198
Now, uh, press play
when we get to the party.

29:03.231 --> 29:04.933
Trust us.

29:21.950 --> 29:25.754
I love this song.
Let's dance.

29:37.298 --> 29:39.401
Doesn't it seem
sort of wrong

29:39.434 --> 29:41.303
to be dancing
on someone's grave?

29:42.805 --> 29:45.673
I've got
a secret for you, kiddo:

29:45.708 --> 29:48.377
they're already dead,
they won't even know.

31:07.154 --> 31:09.624
The stars look amazing.

31:09.659 --> 31:10.758
You look amazing.

31:10.792 --> 31:12.161
You are amazing.

31:14.662 --> 31:16.598
You need to reapply, poodle.

31:18.033 --> 31:21.003
Well, well,
if it isn't a Goth convention?

31:21.036 --> 31:22.837
Not again.

31:23.738 --> 31:26.408
Oh, hey, newbie!
Nice lipstick.

31:26.441 --> 31:28.809
Very fetching.

31:28.844 --> 31:31.080
Aww, don't you two make
a cute couple?

31:31.113 --> 31:32.847
Don't touch me, man!

31:32.881 --> 31:35.050
Victor, your girlfriend says
I stop touching her.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.352
I'm not his girlfriend.

31:37.452 --> 31:38.819
You hear that, Victor?

31:38.853 --> 31:39.921
She says she's not
your girlfriend.

31:39.955 --> 31:41.123
How does that make you feel?

31:42.324 --> 31:44.693
Oh, I was just
having a little fun.

31:44.727 --> 31:46.094
Am I making everyone
uncomfortable?

31:46.128 --> 31:47.129
Why don't you
just leave?

31:47.162 --> 31:48.863
You weren't even
going to be here.

31:50.132 --> 31:52.668
Hate the cemetery, nothing
but goths and dead people.

31:53.701 --> 31:55.103
Hey, you know
what would be really convenient?

32:02.077 --> 32:03.812
If I just killed all of you
and buried you here.

32:04.813 --> 32:06.248
Just get out of here.

32:07.848 --> 32:09.050
I mean...

32:11.786 --> 32:13.288
...you're a Goth now.

32:13.322 --> 32:14.689
You goths can't wait to die.

32:14.722 --> 32:16.224
Stop it,
you're hurting me.

32:16.257 --> 32:17.357
Who's gonna make me?

32:17.359 --> 32:19.128
Antonio, stop.

32:20.228 --> 32:21.764
Try me.

32:28.103 --> 32:30.305
Damned goths,
I should bury all of you.

32:30.338 --> 32:31.806
Punk bitch.

32:33.674 --> 32:35.076
Victor, just let him go.

32:36.344 --> 32:37.779
What did you just say to me?

32:45.220 --> 32:46.721
Antonio!

32:49.024 --> 32:50.293
Enough!

32:57.364 --> 32:58.968
Let's go!

32:59.867 --> 33:01.803
Why are punks
such animals?

33:03.071 --> 33:06.275
You okay?
That was such a buzzkill.

33:08.410 --> 33:11.680
Come on. I wanna show you
something.

33:37.439 --> 33:39.175
I like to think of this
as my summer home.

33:43.312 --> 33:45.948
Let's stay here all night
and we can get up

33:45.980 --> 33:48.284
and watch the sunrise.

34:00.728 --> 34:02.396
Is everything okay?

34:02.430 --> 34:05.633
Um, I guess I'm just
still a little freaked

34:05.667 --> 34:08.103
with the whole scene
with Antonio maybe.

34:11.672 --> 34:13.174
You're a virgin,
aren't you?

34:13.206 --> 34:17.077
What?
Well, yeah, technically.

34:17.110 --> 34:19.748
Technically?,
yeah, you're a virgin.

34:20.915 --> 34:22.984
I guess I just need
to slow things down a little.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.853
Okay?

34:24.886 --> 34:26.920
Sure. I get it.

34:52.446 --> 34:53.815
Oh, my God, what time is it?

34:55.750 --> 34:57.386
My grandparents
are gonna kill me.

34:59.254 --> 35:02.323
- You coming?
- Curse the light.

35:08.196 --> 35:09.732
Are you just now getting in?

35:10.899 --> 35:14.069
Yeah, I was hanging out
at Victor's late last night

35:14.102 --> 35:16.004
and I guess we fell asleep.

35:16.038 --> 35:18.073
We were over there
until late last night

35:18.107 --> 35:21.143
and, uh,
we didn't see you there.

35:22.977 --> 35:25.113
Are you going
to tell us what really happened?

35:26.214 --> 35:27.650
Okay. Victor
and I went to a party

35:27.683 --> 35:29.184
at the old cemetery
and we kind of fell

35:29.218 --> 35:30.719
asleep together in a tomb.

35:30.752 --> 35:33.122
But it's cool, nothing happened,
it was totally PG.

35:34.323 --> 35:37.792
Was your phone
stolen while you were sleeping?

35:37.826 --> 35:39.227
Whatever, okay?

35:39.261 --> 35:42.031
I go to one lousy party
and I get interrogated.

35:42.964 --> 35:44.065
Ouch!

35:44.098 --> 35:45.167
What did you that for?

35:45.200 --> 35:46.801
Because I can
legally beat the crap...

35:46.835 --> 35:48.938
beat any sense into you.

35:49.870 --> 35:51.973
Next time send a text,
young lady.

35:53.140 --> 35:54.142
You know how to text?

35:54.176 --> 35:55.244
Nah.

36:18.132 --> 36:20.102
Say something
and I will get back to you.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.837
Maybe.

36:35.082 --> 36:37.818
OMG!
What did you do to your hair?

36:37.852 --> 36:39.687
I met a boy.

36:39.721 --> 36:42.390
Okay, obviously,
I need the Lydia Deetz.

36:42.422 --> 36:43.825
What?

36:43.859 --> 36:45.826
Who is he? I mean he has
to be a good kisser

36:45.861 --> 36:47.661
to make your hair
change colour like that.

36:47.696 --> 36:50.199
You are really
out of control, you know that?

36:50.232 --> 36:51.300
I miss you.

36:51.332 --> 36:54.969
I'm only 45 minutes away,
I should just come over.

36:55.002 --> 36:58.105
I would love that,
you can meet Victor.

36:58.138 --> 37:00.276
Ooh!
He sounds like trouble.

37:00.308 --> 37:02.643
I think he might be.
We spent the night together

37:02.678 --> 37:05.714
- in a tomb.
- Okay, that is totally creepy,

37:05.747 --> 37:07.315
and I'm totally there.

37:07.348 --> 37:09.383
Okay, sweet.
See you soon.

37:09.417 --> 37:10.685
I'll check on my parentals

37:10.718 --> 37:12.286
and I'll get back to you.

37:12.321 --> 37:13.721
Later, Lydia.

37:26.335 --> 37:27.335
Hello there, YouTube.

37:27.368 --> 37:29.036
So today, I'm going
to be doing

37:29.069 --> 37:30.671
my everyday makeup routine.

37:30.705 --> 37:32.107
And I'm going
to be showing you how...

37:48.122 --> 37:49.156
So you can take it up

37:49.189 --> 37:52.760
as high as you want depending
on the kind of...

37:53.728 --> 37:54.562
Whenever you tease your hair,

37:54.596 --> 37:56.364
you're gonna take
a brush like this.

38:00.268 --> 38:02.870
It's time to hairspray,
the ever-living shit

38:02.904 --> 38:04.372
out of his hair.

38:10.946 --> 38:13.281
Hi, guys,
what are you doing?

38:13.314 --> 38:15.716
Well, the
picnic, duh.

38:15.750 --> 38:17.252
And your little boyfriend's
grandparents

38:17.285 --> 38:18.754
are itching to get going.

38:18.786 --> 38:20.221
He's not my boyfriend.

38:20.254 --> 38:22.056
Let's get to move on, people.

38:33.734 --> 38:36.136
Well, if it isn't
the belle of the ball...

38:36.171 --> 38:38.172
I didn't have my team
to put me together this morning.

38:38.205 --> 38:39.774
What do you think?

38:41.042 --> 38:45.747
It's close, but not quite.

38:45.779 --> 38:47.248
It's like you're holding
back or something.

38:48.450 --> 38:51.886
I guess I'm just new
to this whole goth thing.

38:51.919 --> 38:54.388
I think you're just
scared of what people

38:54.422 --> 38:56.959
would think if you really
went for it.

38:58.026 --> 38:59.627
I don't care
what people think.

38:59.660 --> 39:02.129
No?

39:02.163 --> 39:04.932
Well, if you don't care
what people think...

39:07.002 --> 39:08.704
why did you just ask me
what I thought?

39:33.661 --> 39:35.330
Huh. It's a little
early for Halloween,

39:35.364 --> 39:36.932
don't you think?

39:40.067 --> 39:42.870
Hey, Victor, try not to get
your ass kicked today, would ya?

39:42.904 --> 39:45.007
Would you look
at that!

39:45.040 --> 39:47.642
A hot dog wrapped in bacon?

39:47.676 --> 39:49.210
God bless America.

39:51.044 --> 39:52.780
You want to get out of here?

41:52.466 --> 41:54.169
Happy 4th of July,
Joey.

42:22.029 --> 42:23.698
You want to go
to our summer place?

42:31.004 --> 42:33.273
Happy birthday,
America.

42:33.308 --> 42:34.976
I don't ever wanna
go back,

42:35.009 --> 42:37.279
can't we just stay
in the cemetery forever?

42:38.712 --> 42:40.348
Wow,

42:40.381 --> 42:43.317
maybe you are real goth.

43:21.022 --> 43:22.623
See you later?

43:22.656 --> 43:24.225
You know where to find me.

43:44.346 --> 43:46.848
Have a nice evening, Joey?

43:46.881 --> 43:48.649
Yeah, Thanks, Mimi.

43:48.683 --> 43:49.851
Want paincakes?

43:49.884 --> 43:51.953
No, I'm just going
to sleep for a while.

43:51.986 --> 43:53.854
Victor and I are gonna
hang out later.

43:54.888 --> 43:56.390
Didn't we agree
you would text

43:56.424 --> 43:58.794
the next time you were going
to stay out late?

43:58.826 --> 44:01.428
Yeah, I lost my phone,
but no worries, I found it.

44:01.462 --> 44:02.997
You're spending
an awful lot of time

44:03.031 --> 44:04.733
with that boy.

44:06.067 --> 44:09.204
Yeah, well,
I really like him, I guess.

44:09.236 --> 44:11.338
We don't like it
that you're staying out

44:11.372 --> 44:14.808
all night.
Are you being... safe?

44:14.843 --> 44:16.176
Okay, It's fine.
Nothing's happened.

44:16.210 --> 44:18.914
Your mother
called worried to death.

44:20.015 --> 44:21.049
If my mother
is so worried

44:21.082 --> 44:22.984
about my whereabouts,
so why she dumped me here

44:23.017 --> 44:24.152
all summer?

44:24.185 --> 44:25.420
Why don't you spend
some time

44:25.453 --> 44:26.954
with your grandparents
this summer?

44:26.988 --> 44:28.922
Okay. You guys, listen,
I'm sorry

44:28.957 --> 44:31.025
that I didn't send a text,
but I figured you guys knew

44:31.058 --> 44:32.127
I was with Victor.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.627
That doesn't
make us feel any better.

44:33.660 --> 44:37.263
We're asking you not see Victor
for two weeks.

44:37.297 --> 44:38.966
Are you, like,
grounding me?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.135
We're not grounding you.

44:40.167 --> 44:44.205
We're just limiting
your bad choices.

44:44.239 --> 44:46.041
And what does
that mean exactly?

44:46.073 --> 44:47.308
We're grounding you.

46:04.152 --> 46:05.353
Hi, it's Mom.

46:07.989 --> 46:09.624
Hello, it's your mom.

46:12.093 --> 46:14.094
It's Carissa calling.

46:31.712 --> 46:32.814
Joey, dear.

46:32.846 --> 46:34.783
Yes, grandfather, dear.

46:34.815 --> 46:36.384
We thought it might be
a good idea

46:36.417 --> 46:40.087
if you joined us.
We have big plans.

46:40.120 --> 46:41.989
Oh, big plans huh?

46:42.022 --> 46:44.858
I'm not sure I can resist
the sound of that, Papa.

46:44.892 --> 46:46.794
And I'm not sure
I would have taken no

46:46.828 --> 46:48.129
for an answer.

46:48.161 --> 46:51.632
Now throw on something black
and meet us downstairs.

46:52.667 --> 46:54.002
Yes!

46:58.471 --> 47:00.841
People actually
play bingo?

47:00.875 --> 47:03.210
This ain't your
grandma's bingo.

47:03.243 --> 47:05.912
This is like acid trip bingo.

47:05.946 --> 47:07.113
Now, I'm curious.

47:07.147 --> 47:08.248
Yeah. Come on.

47:08.283 --> 47:10.384
O row, 69.

47:10.417 --> 47:14.788
And our next number
is in the B row, B-11.

47:14.823 --> 47:17.391
Up next, we have...

47:17.424 --> 47:19.693
Oh, bingo?

47:19.727 --> 47:20.795
Helga!

47:20.828 --> 47:22.329
My goodness, you won again.

47:22.363 --> 47:24.065
Come on up!
Let's see,

47:24.098 --> 47:26.368
I have to confirm that,
'cause you win an awful lot.

47:26.401 --> 47:27.567
I'm suspicious.

47:27.602 --> 47:29.703
And everybody's so quiet,
they're not very happy for you.

47:29.738 --> 47:31.339
Can we get
a nice bunch of applause

47:31.372 --> 47:33.241
We had to be supportive
of one another.

47:33.274 --> 47:35.609
B-3, yes.

47:35.643 --> 47:37.378
B-11, yes.

47:37.410 --> 47:40.146
O-69, my favorite number.

47:40.181 --> 47:41.249
Congratulations.

47:41.281 --> 47:42.616
How do you always win so much?

47:42.649 --> 47:44.251
I'm an expert at bingo.

47:44.285 --> 47:45.719
You're a very expert bingo.

47:45.752 --> 47:46.653
Thank you so much.

47:46.687 --> 47:48.055
Your prize is...
Are you ready for this?

47:48.089 --> 47:50.024
A year's supply of soft cheese.

47:50.056 --> 47:52.160
Oh? I like it.

47:52.192 --> 47:54.194
I knew you would.
You're welcome. Congratulations.

47:54.228 --> 47:55.696
Very nice, supportive of Helga.

47:56.797 --> 47:58.299
Okay, everybody,
welcome to our newcomers

47:58.332 --> 47:59.732
who have just arrived
a little bit late.

47:59.767 --> 48:02.370
Nice to see you,
little unhappy girl, welcome.

48:02.402 --> 48:04.772
Okay, ready? The game you're
going through right now

48:04.806 --> 48:07.275
is just plain old regular
straight bingo.

48:07.308 --> 48:09.744
Just like me, plain, old,
regular and straight.

48:09.777 --> 48:12.646
You can go up and down, side
to side or diagonal, got it?

48:12.680 --> 48:14.248
You only need five to win.

48:14.281 --> 48:17.151
How about B-4?

48:17.183 --> 48:20.087
Not after but B-4.

48:20.120 --> 48:23.657
- I have that one.
- Oh, good.

48:23.690 --> 48:27.895
And our next member
is G-55.

48:27.928 --> 48:29.631
I can't drive 55.

48:29.663 --> 48:30.832
I got that one too.

48:30.864 --> 48:32.067
That's great!

48:34.868 --> 48:37.872
The last number
in the bingo board is O-75.

48:37.906 --> 48:39.940
How about O-7-5?

48:39.973 --> 48:41.109
I got it.

48:41.142 --> 48:42.243
And ladies
and gentlemen

48:42.276 --> 48:46.980
and those in between, for you,
our next number is I-27.

48:47.015 --> 48:48.950
My age I-2-7.

48:48.982 --> 48:50.218
Don't snicker over there.

48:50.250 --> 48:52.085
Oh, my gosh, wait,
with the free space,

48:52.118 --> 48:53.353
I think that I might have...

48:53.386 --> 48:57.892
- Shout it out! Shout!
- Bingo!

48:57.926 --> 48:59.360
Another winner in the family!

48:59.393 --> 49:01.228
Oh, wait a minute,
did you say bingo?

49:01.261 --> 49:02.363
Yeah!

49:02.395 --> 49:04.031
Oh, I couldn't hear
with all this popcorn machine.

49:04.064 --> 49:06.166
So, okay, zombie girl.
Come on, let's see what you got.

49:08.069 --> 49:09.671
The game was rigged.

49:09.703 --> 49:10.805
You're the new one, right?

49:10.839 --> 49:11.806
I haven't seen you
around here before.

49:11.839 --> 49:12.707
Yeah, it's my first time.

49:12.739 --> 49:13.975
Oh my! You haven't
played Bingo ever?

49:14.007 --> 49:15.176
- Hum, hum.
- Oh, my gosh.

49:15.209 --> 49:17.011
You've ever been this close
to a man in a dress before?

49:17.044 --> 49:18.011
Oh, I don't think so.

49:18.046 --> 49:19.212
It's the day
of firsts for you.

49:19.245 --> 49:20.080
- What is your name?
- Joey.

49:20.114 --> 49:21.816
Joey, nice to meet you.
I'm Ralph.

49:21.848 --> 49:24.852
Okay, so we have B-4.

49:24.886 --> 49:27.721
We have I-27. Okay.

49:27.754 --> 49:29.390
You use your free spot,
very clever.

49:29.422 --> 49:30.991
Sometimes cheating,
but not in this case.

49:31.024 --> 49:33.626
How about G-55? Yes.

49:33.660 --> 49:36.129
And O-75?
That's a good bingo.

49:36.163 --> 49:37.832
Let's get a nice round
of applause for Joey.

49:37.864 --> 49:39.667
Congratulations! Okay, Joey.

49:39.700 --> 49:40.868
So, there's no more
soft cheeses.

49:40.902 --> 49:43.371
But I have for you
a two-month pass

49:43.404 --> 49:47.175
to underwater aerobics
at the SINU center.

49:47.207 --> 49:49.075
Oh, we can go together!

49:49.109 --> 49:52.078
I know, they usually
like that kind of prize.

49:52.113 --> 49:53.381
Congratulations.

49:53.415 --> 49:55.884
Applause for Joey one more time.
Thank you so much.

49:55.917 --> 49:57.250
And now we're going
to clear the board.

49:57.283 --> 49:58.718
We're going to play again;
you guys ready?

49:58.752 --> 49:59.953
Let's play again!

50:01.689 --> 50:03.892
How's your licorice,
bingo queen?

50:05.792 --> 50:07.727
Even her tongue
wears black.

50:07.761 --> 50:11.097
You see, it's not
so bad hanging here with us?

50:11.131 --> 50:13.834
Yeah, you guys
are all right, I guess.

50:13.868 --> 50:15.804
I wonder
how your mom is doing.

50:18.372 --> 50:20.173
I don't.

50:20.207 --> 50:21.643
Whoops!

50:22.676 --> 50:26.213
Listen,
you can always talk to us.

50:27.080 --> 50:28.181
Okay.

50:28.214 --> 50:31.051
How about we just keep not
talking about her or him?

50:31.085 --> 50:34.322
- Okay?
- You know what?

50:34.355 --> 50:36.757
I think today is the last day

50:36.790 --> 50:39.126
of your grounding,
zombie girl.

50:39.160 --> 50:40.228
What do you think, mimi?

50:40.261 --> 50:43.397
Yeah, she satisfied
the terms of her sentencing.

50:43.430 --> 50:45.332
Really?
Like, you mean it?

50:45.366 --> 50:46.934
Mm-hmm.

50:46.966 --> 50:49.203
You're all cleared
for takeoff, little bird.

51:05.152 --> 51:06.854
Aren't you gonna
say, "Trick or treat"?

51:06.886 --> 51:08.256
Bye, guys, yes, I promise

51:08.288 --> 51:09.890
I'll text
if we're gonna be out late.

51:16.364 --> 51:18.833
You're sure you want
to take them camping?

51:20.368 --> 51:22.703
At least I know
they'll love your ghost stories.

51:25.372 --> 51:26.974
Thank god.

51:33.714 --> 51:35.181
I'm beginning to tan!

51:35.216 --> 51:37.886
Well, that's a cream was
with positively blood-curdling.

51:37.919 --> 51:39.252
That's such a turn-on.

51:39.286 --> 51:41.288
Let's get out of here,
I'm starting to melt.

51:41.321 --> 51:42.957
Wait, one last shot,
okay, guys?

51:45.692 --> 51:46.995
I win!

51:55.435 --> 51:57.171
Gonna have to use
a ton of powder tonight.

51:57.203 --> 51:59.906
Or we wanna like
extra dud for the party.

51:59.940 --> 52:01.308
What party?

52:01.341 --> 52:03.243
Victor didn't tell you
about the party?

52:03.277 --> 52:05.113
No, he didn't mention it.

52:06.647 --> 52:08.583
I got to take it,
I'll be right back.

52:09.450 --> 52:12.152
Joey. Lipstick.

52:21.661 --> 52:24.899
So, you guys gonna tell
me about this party or what?

52:25.866 --> 52:28.002
Okay, get over it.

52:29.870 --> 52:31.939
I think I know
what you're gonna say,

52:31.973 --> 52:35.176
but we kind of work together,
don't we?

52:35.209 --> 52:37.212
We just don't want you
to feel unwelcome, that's all.

52:38.245 --> 52:40.147
And why would Joey
feel unwelcome?

52:41.948 --> 52:43.816
- Oh, right, the party.
- What?

52:43.850 --> 52:46.786
Am I, like, not invited
or something?

52:46.819 --> 52:48.055
Well, at first,
I didn't invite you

52:48.089 --> 52:49.824
because you were grounded.

52:49.857 --> 52:52.726
But I have to admit
I am a little nervous

52:52.759 --> 52:54.094
you might feel uncomfortable.

52:55.696 --> 52:57.131
Why would I be uncomfortable?

52:58.399 --> 53:01.067
Because these are
real goths.

53:01.100 --> 53:03.036
You may feel like
kind of a poser.

53:04.172 --> 53:07.608
I never thought
of myself as a poser.

53:07.642 --> 53:08.875
You can't just
dye your hair

53:08.910 --> 53:10.245
and change your clothes
for the summer

53:10.277 --> 53:13.247
and expect everyone
to accept you as one of our own.

53:13.279 --> 53:15.582
It's not just a scene,
it's a way of life.

53:17.652 --> 53:20.955
Hey, hey, don't pout,
pretty lady.

53:22.290 --> 53:23.858
It'll be fun.

53:25.792 --> 53:27.661
I promise.

53:35.370 --> 53:37.004
Are you sure I'm dressed up
enough?

53:37.036 --> 53:40.707
Yes. You look fine, please.

53:49.250 --> 53:52.152
Relax,
they can smell your fear.

53:52.185 --> 53:53.687
I can't help it.

53:53.719 --> 53:55.122
I don't want them thinking
that I'm a poser.

53:55.156 --> 53:58.058
Please,
you're with me,

53:58.091 --> 53:59.993
and practically goth royalty.

54:05.064 --> 54:06.733
Victor.

54:11.839 --> 54:13.975
You didn't tell me you
would be bringing company.

54:15.109 --> 54:19.013
Yes, Pandora,
this is Josephine,

54:19.046 --> 54:21.381
the newest addition
to our little coven.

54:21.415 --> 54:23.117
You can call me Joey.

54:24.417 --> 54:27.754
Joey, this is Pandora.
She's our host,

54:27.788 --> 54:31.059
and her family owns the biggest
mortuary in town.

54:31.091 --> 54:32.426
- Oh.
- Yes.

54:32.460 --> 54:34.695
Business has been
especially good lately.

54:34.727 --> 54:36.763
Why?
You've been killing them?

54:39.433 --> 54:40.901
No, I just mean that you...

54:40.935 --> 54:42.069
it must be really convenient,
you know,

54:42.102 --> 54:43.704
having your family
on the mortuary,

54:43.738 --> 54:46.272
you know, being like
a goth and...

54:46.306 --> 54:48.308
Oh, poo!

54:48.341 --> 54:50.910
Sad thing, empty chalices.

54:50.944 --> 54:52.413
Victor, do you fancy
accompanying me

54:52.446 --> 54:54.815
to get some punch?

54:54.848 --> 54:56.650
Sure!

54:56.683 --> 54:58.618
Come, Josephine.

54:58.652 --> 55:00.788
Let's all go get some punch!

55:10.464 --> 55:12.900
Vampires' blood, spooky.

55:19.640 --> 55:24.277
Well,
your little friend is charming.

55:24.310 --> 55:26.814
Where did you find her?

55:26.846 --> 55:29.750
It's the neighbor girl.
But a doll, isn't she?

55:32.352 --> 55:33.386
I stopped playing

55:33.419 --> 55:35.288
with dolls a long time ago,
Victor.

55:36.455 --> 55:39.227
So, how about that
Marilyn Manson, right?

55:45.765 --> 55:47.968
Excuse me
for a moment, would you?

55:48.000 --> 55:50.971
It looks as though someone's
in desperate need of rescuing.

55:53.674 --> 55:55.243
Come, my pet!

55:57.410 --> 55:58.945
New project.

56:08.189 --> 56:09.790
I'm gonna get a drink.

56:09.823 --> 56:11.190
What's that?

56:11.223 --> 56:13.126
Said I'm gonna kill myself.

56:13.160 --> 56:15.296
I can't hear you.

56:15.328 --> 56:16.830
This should do.

56:20.134 --> 56:22.737
Ouch, peachy!

56:24.971 --> 56:26.239
Hey Victor, you should try...

56:28.709 --> 56:29.977
Sorry.

56:31.879 --> 56:34.647
Hey, guys!
What are you doing?

56:34.681 --> 56:37.418
Summoning the spirits.
How about yourself?

56:37.451 --> 56:39.652
I lost Victor.

56:39.687 --> 56:41.054
You smell pretty
fruity there.

56:41.087 --> 56:42.154
What's in your cup?

56:42.189 --> 56:43.825
It's peachy!
You wanna try?

56:45.725 --> 56:46.993
Well, well, well.

56:47.027 --> 56:49.763
If it isn't America's
next top Goth.

56:49.797 --> 56:51.799
What are you doing here?

56:51.832 --> 56:54.067
Slumming! Need a drink?

56:54.100 --> 56:56.169
I am all set. Thanks.

56:56.203 --> 56:58.706
What are you doing here?

56:58.739 --> 57:00.975
Well, if you really
must know, I came with Victor.

57:02.743 --> 57:04.645
Have you seen him, by chance?

57:04.678 --> 57:07.714
You know, I'm really
not that bad of a guy.

57:07.747 --> 57:09.349
I don't know what happened
the other night.

57:09.382 --> 57:11.151
You guys! I don't
mean to be rude,

57:11.185 --> 57:13.887
but we're trying to communicate
with the other side here.

57:13.921 --> 57:16.089
Yeah. Why don't you
and the Jolly Rancher

57:16.122 --> 57:18.058
take your conversation
over there?

57:20.294 --> 57:21.763
Okay.

57:38.978 --> 57:42.181
What should I play?
"Bela Lugosi's Dead"?

57:42.216 --> 57:43.683
Never heard of it.

57:45.451 --> 57:47.587
You're new to this whole Goth
thing, aren't you?

57:51.123 --> 57:52.426
Hello, new girl.

57:52.460 --> 57:55.763
Oh, hey, Pandora.
This is my friend, Antonio.

57:56.730 --> 57:58.799
Who cares?
Where's Victor?

57:58.832 --> 58:01.669
I am looking
for him too, actually.

58:02.868 --> 58:05.272
You know,
you two are so cute together.

58:06.205 --> 58:08.142
Me and Victor?
Thank you, Pandora.

58:08.174 --> 58:09.609
No, you and him.

58:12.946 --> 58:14.748
You wanna do shots?

58:14.781 --> 58:16.750
Why are you being
so nice to me?

58:22.223 --> 58:23.224
Where is the drink?

58:23.256 --> 58:24.757
What are you doing
with my cup?

58:27.160 --> 58:28.728
Okay.

58:28.761 --> 58:30.964
I need a cane. Don't. Stop it!

58:30.997 --> 58:32.165
I wanna sing. Okay.

58:32.198 --> 58:33.967
From the top of the strings...

58:36.035 --> 58:37.137
Joey!

58:37.171 --> 58:38.872
Joey! Joey! Joey!

58:38.904 --> 58:40.975
Victor,
this is my friend, Antonio.

58:41.007 --> 58:42.877
Nice to meet... Oh, no.
What I'm I talking about?

58:42.910 --> 58:45.413
You guys have already met,
remember the graveyard?

58:45.446 --> 58:48.181
Yes.
Good to see you again, Antonio.

58:48.214 --> 58:49.415
Yeah.

58:49.448 --> 58:50.916
It's time to go.

58:50.951 --> 58:53.286
What?
I'm just starting to have fun.

58:53.321 --> 58:54.855
No, I am not going.

58:57.924 --> 58:59.326
I think I'm gonna retch...

59:00.426 --> 59:02.328
Okay. The fun is over.

59:02.361 --> 59:04.263
But wait.
No, I don't want to go.

59:04.297 --> 59:05.332
No, no, no, no, no.

59:05.364 --> 59:08.133
See, I wanna sing
with my friends and I wanna...

59:08.167 --> 59:10.203
Wait, where is everybody going?

59:10.236 --> 59:12.272
Wait!

59:12.306 --> 59:14.208
Okay.

59:14.241 --> 59:16.643
- Hey, Victor?
- Yes?

59:16.676 --> 59:19.579
Do you think I'm a real goth?

59:20.781 --> 59:23.985
No, I think
that you're real mess.

59:26.018 --> 59:27.254
Oh, sorry!

59:28.721 --> 59:29.957
Okay.

59:37.997 --> 59:40.100
Baby bats just can't hold
their liquor.

59:42.301 --> 59:43.970
What's going on?

59:51.944 --> 59:52.979
Hey!

59:54.314 --> 59:56.382
Yeah, me too.

59:56.417 --> 59:58.185
Listen, I can't talk right now.

59:59.986 --> 01:00:03.056
Okay, good night, beautiful.

01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:13.401
Antonio,
it's never gonna happen.

01:00:42.629 --> 01:00:44.899
Say something and I
will get back to you. Maybe.

01:00:45.866 --> 01:00:46.934
Hey, Victor.

01:00:48.368 --> 01:00:51.972
I think I might owe you
an apology or something.

01:00:52.973 --> 01:00:54.275
Call me, okay?

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:05.986
Thought you might need a
strong cup of Joe this morning.

01:01:06.018 --> 01:01:08.022
Thank you, yeah.

01:01:18.131 --> 01:01:21.868
Oh. Oh, God, curse the light.
No, no.

01:01:23.036 --> 01:01:26.073
How about joining me
for a dance class later, huh?

01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:27.741
Might be good to sweat it out.

01:01:27.774 --> 01:01:31.144
Yeah, and it also might
be good to stay in bed all day.

01:01:32.312 --> 01:01:34.413
Maybe it's not
exercise you need,

01:01:34.446 --> 01:01:37.017
maybe it's an exorcism.

01:01:37.051 --> 01:01:40.621
- What?
- We've tried everything else.

01:01:41.721 --> 01:01:44.123
Maybe it is time
to call in a priest.

01:01:44.158 --> 01:01:45.226
Okay, very funny.

01:01:45.259 --> 01:01:46.961
No, I'm not joking.

01:01:48.828 --> 01:01:50.096
I'm pretty sure

01:01:50.129 --> 01:01:53.800
you're possessed
by a soul-devouring demon.

01:01:53.834 --> 01:01:55.167
What else would make you
stay out all night

01:01:55.201 --> 01:01:56.770
keeping us up with worry?

01:01:56.803 --> 01:01:58.771
What else would make you
get drunk?

01:01:58.805 --> 01:02:01.075
And do drugs in our home?

01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:03.109
Why?

01:02:03.143 --> 01:02:06.179
Oh, why are you still
chasing after that boy?

01:02:06.212 --> 01:02:09.114
Victor doesn't care
a flying flip about you.

01:02:09.149 --> 01:02:11.719
Okay,
how I feel shittier.

01:02:12.819 --> 01:02:14.587
That's the demon.

01:02:15.689 --> 01:02:17.658
You might wanna
to look into that.

01:03:09.743 --> 01:03:10.844
Hello, Victor?

01:03:10.877 --> 01:03:13.312
Oh, hey!
Finally, she answers.

01:03:13.346 --> 01:03:14.346
Are you alive?

01:03:14.381 --> 01:03:17.750
Are your grandparents
taking for care of you?

01:03:17.783 --> 01:03:19.385
What is it I hear about a boy?

01:03:19.419 --> 01:03:20.819
Are you using protection?

01:03:20.853 --> 01:03:22.388
- Jesus, Mom.
- What?

01:03:22.422 --> 01:03:24.958
I know what a summer
fling is like.

01:03:24.991 --> 01:03:26.360
It's not a fling. Okay?

01:03:27.995 --> 01:03:30.263
Oh, it's not a fling.
So, it's serious.

01:03:30.297 --> 01:03:31.865
What, after a month and a half?

01:03:31.899 --> 01:03:34.267
Was there a point
to this phone call, Mother?

01:03:34.301 --> 01:03:36.837
I'm just calling to tell
my daughter that I love her.

01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:40.373
Is that for me or for the
fans? Later, Mom.

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:46.247
Ah, that is such
a nice thing to say, honey.

01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:48.782
Okay, well, talk
to you tomorrow.

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:52.152
And who should
I make this out to?

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:57.558
What is he doing?

01:03:58.725 --> 01:04:00.227
OMG, it totally feels like we're
detectives right now.

01:04:00.259 --> 01:04:01.895
Focus!

01:04:03.997 --> 01:04:06.132
He's smoking.

01:04:06.165 --> 01:04:07.767
Ew.

01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:09.902
You fell for a smoker,
that doesn't seem like you.

01:04:09.937 --> 01:04:12.238
I wouldn't say that I'd
fallen for him exactly.

01:04:12.272 --> 01:04:14.408
You're stalking him
with your best friend,

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.276
you're so totally.

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:20.314
Here. Let me look at him.

01:04:25.018 --> 01:04:27.187
He's so goth.

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:33.193
I don't trust the look of him,
Joey.

01:04:34.426 --> 01:04:37.363
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:04:37.397 --> 01:04:39.966
Who's ready
for a little fun in the forest?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.735
How are the good
horror films start.

01:04:42.768 --> 01:04:44.671
It's him!

01:04:47.073 --> 01:04:48.642
He knows we're watching him.

01:04:49.776 --> 01:04:52.346
Girls,
we're loading the car.

01:04:52.379 --> 01:04:55.082
"Have you ever
done it in the woods?"

01:04:56.382 --> 01:04:59.118
Girls, I can hear
everything you're saying.

01:05:03.689 --> 01:05:04.991
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:11.665
What about Victor?

01:05:15.301 --> 01:05:16.401
Hey there!

01:05:16.435 --> 01:05:18.337
I wanted you two
to finally meet.

01:05:18.372 --> 01:05:20.040
I'm the BFF.

01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:25.044
You were pretty trashed the
other night, weren't you?

01:05:25.078 --> 01:05:27.080
I tried calling you.

01:05:27.113 --> 01:05:28.881
I left my phone
at Pandora's.

01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:31.350
I was worried

01:05:31.384 --> 01:05:33.252
that I might have done
permanent damage.

01:05:33.286 --> 01:05:34.821
I mean, when I woke up
the next morning,

01:05:34.855 --> 01:05:37.123
I wasn't even sure
how I got home.

01:05:37.156 --> 01:05:39.292
Well, that sounds
like quite a night.

01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:40.761
It wasn't.

01:05:44.163 --> 01:05:46.932
You look like
a couple of dead honeymooners

01:05:46.966 --> 01:05:48.701
from one of Margaret's
ghost stories.

01:05:48.734 --> 01:05:50.402
Thank you.

01:05:50.437 --> 01:05:53.841
Joey, get your little
friends stop scaring

01:05:53.873 --> 01:05:56.676
the other campers
and help us set up. Okay?

01:05:58.178 --> 01:05:59.779
Hi, I'm Molly.

01:05:59.812 --> 01:06:01.281
EnchantÃ©e!

01:06:04.017 --> 01:06:06.654
You've got to be
kidding me, right?

01:06:11.189 --> 01:06:12.759
- Ready, Margaret?
- Yeah.

01:06:12.792 --> 01:06:15.294
Oh, we're so terrible!

01:06:44.757 --> 01:06:46.225
That was unexpected.

01:06:46.259 --> 01:06:48.261
I know, but kind of fun,
right?

01:06:48.294 --> 01:06:50.631
Well, he doesn't
seem to think so.

01:07:02.042 --> 01:07:06.379
And the beast
had recently acquired a mate.

01:07:06.411 --> 01:07:08.681
And she gave birth

01:07:08.714 --> 01:07:11.984
to a brood of little
beautiful beasties.

01:07:13.285 --> 01:07:16.322
And they were ravenous.

01:07:16.355 --> 01:07:17.390
And the beast knew

01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:20.794
he had to find fresh blood,

01:07:20.826 --> 01:07:25.866
guts and gore to feed
his little family.

01:07:26.866 --> 01:07:28.368
So, he put his nose
to the air...

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:31.404
...and sniffed.

01:07:32.739 --> 01:07:34.875
and ferreted out

01:07:34.908 --> 01:07:38.145
a bitter venom.

01:07:38.178 --> 01:07:42.049
It was a mile away,
but the beast could smell him.

01:07:42.082 --> 01:07:44.417
So, he tracked him down,

01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:46.286
and charged,

01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:49.789
and gouged out an eyeball,
and he wanted to devour it.

01:07:51.757 --> 01:07:53.794
- Woo!
- Jesus, Joey!

01:07:55.094 --> 01:07:56.062
You scared me.

01:07:56.096 --> 01:07:57.096
You think that was scary?

01:07:57.129 --> 01:07:59.398
You should hear
one of Margaret's ghost stories.

01:07:59.431 --> 01:08:01.768
I think Pen's half a shade
whiter.

01:08:03.268 --> 01:08:05.671
You want to get out of here?

01:08:06.906 --> 01:08:08.408
What do you mean?

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.710
There's this club
thing happening tonight.

01:08:10.743 --> 01:08:12.044
I think it might be fun.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.015
Oh, I don't know.

01:08:16.049 --> 01:08:18.719
It doesn't seem right somehow.

01:08:19.986 --> 01:08:23.223
Does it seem... wrong?

01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:28.394
And then
the beast disemboweled her

01:08:28.428 --> 01:08:30.263
and strung up

01:08:30.295 --> 01:08:32.264
her freshly murdered cadaver

01:08:32.299 --> 01:08:35.368
with her own hands.

01:08:35.402 --> 01:08:38.305
Carving his name
into the earth below

01:08:38.337 --> 01:08:41.707
as a warning
to all future campers

01:08:41.741 --> 01:08:43.844
who dared to enter

01:08:43.876 --> 01:08:47.380
his forest home again!

01:08:49.782 --> 01:08:53.252
Wooh! Wooh!

01:08:54.888 --> 01:08:56.823
I'm giving you
honorary goth status

01:08:56.857 --> 01:08:59.225
for that macabre
and wonderful tale, Margaret.

01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:04.063
You guys feel like
hitting the club Medusa tonight?

01:09:04.095 --> 01:09:06.631
Actually,
we're kinda having fun here.

01:09:06.666 --> 01:09:08.635
We'll catch it next month.

01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:10.136
What's club Medusa?

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:14.341
Okay, kids,
we're going to turn in.

01:09:14.372 --> 01:09:16.309
Don't stay up too late!

01:09:22.448 --> 01:09:24.116
Can I borrow your car?

01:09:24.151 --> 01:09:25.919
Promise we'll take real
good care of it.

01:09:30.023 --> 01:09:32.658
So, you're really
just going to leave everyone?

01:09:33.693 --> 01:09:37.096
Um, yeah,
there's this party thing.

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:38.698
Let's go.

01:09:40.332 --> 01:09:42.102
Wait!
Molly's gonna come with us.

01:09:42.135 --> 01:09:44.871
She's dying
to go to club Medusa.

01:09:44.903 --> 01:09:46.572
I am?

01:10:01.654 --> 01:10:03.389
You look amazing tonight, Joey.

01:10:04.456 --> 01:10:06.058
I wish I could be you.

01:10:06.091 --> 01:10:07.727
I don't feel amazing.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.796
I feel like I just
ditched everyone.

01:10:09.828 --> 01:10:11.831
You did just
ditch everyone.

01:10:12.864 --> 01:10:16.068
You chose me over them.

01:10:16.102 --> 01:10:18.136
I mean, who wouldn't?

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.772
Just look at me.

01:10:22.142 --> 01:10:24.010
Then again...

01:10:24.944 --> 01:10:26.779
...just look at you.

01:10:30.983 --> 01:10:34.388
Tonight is gonna be
out of control.

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.762
What the hell?

01:10:44.264 --> 01:10:46.666
Come on.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.035
Everyone's waiting.

01:10:48.068 --> 01:10:49.937
Who's everyone?

01:10:52.037 --> 01:10:55.674
Are you sure you
don't want to change?

01:10:55.707 --> 01:10:58.245
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

01:11:22.335 --> 01:11:24.136
I'm going to dance.

01:11:26.038 --> 01:11:29.943
Are you ever going to hit
the concept of reapplying?

01:11:33.345 --> 01:11:34.880
Why are you still
going out with him?

01:11:34.913 --> 01:11:36.683
I'm not going out with him.

01:11:36.715 --> 01:11:38.184
But you're still
hanging out with him?

01:11:38.218 --> 01:11:41.287
Joey, you look beautiful.
It's okay.

01:11:41.321 --> 01:11:46.660
- Hey, what were you doing?
- Come on!

01:11:48.728 --> 01:11:51.364
- You wanna dance?
- Okay.

01:11:51.398 --> 01:11:53.666
I'm gonna find
the bathroom.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.035
Okay.

01:11:58.104 --> 01:12:00.841
Excuse me! Sorry! Sorry!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:12:04.743 --> 01:12:06.246
Looking rather fetching
tonight.

01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:08.348
- Are you with Victor?
- Sort of.

01:12:09.815 --> 01:12:11.218
Are you okay?

01:12:11.251 --> 01:12:12.786
I have no idea.

01:12:15.221 --> 01:12:17.090
Oh, God! I'm...

01:12:17.122 --> 01:12:19.192
Is everything okay?

01:12:19.225 --> 01:12:22.728
This night has gotten
very confusing very fast, sorry.

01:12:22.761 --> 01:12:23.964
Excuse me.

01:12:38.711 --> 01:12:40.146
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:13:05.171 --> 01:13:06.372
Nice, dude.

01:13:07.305 --> 01:13:10.042
Hey, look what we've got here.

01:13:10.076 --> 01:13:13.645
Oh, why are you
so sad little goth chick?

01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:15.982
Did your DVD of "The Craft"
get scratched?

01:13:16.014 --> 01:13:17.783
Douchebag.

01:13:17.817 --> 01:13:20.219
What did you just say to me?

01:13:20.252 --> 01:13:21.787
Say it again.

01:13:23.156 --> 01:13:25.358
I said, I bet you love

01:13:25.392 --> 01:13:27.426
giving your boyfriend's
mullet a little tug

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:28.995
every time you blow him.

01:13:29.028 --> 01:13:31.363
You did not just say that you
feisty little freak!

01:13:31.398 --> 01:13:33.733
- What are you doing?
- Little tailgate party.

01:13:33.765 --> 01:13:35.768
You guys sure know
how to treat a lady.

01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:36.935
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:38.071
I already got
myself a date.

01:13:38.104 --> 01:13:39.772
With your mother
or your sister?

01:13:39.805 --> 01:13:42.308
You wanna say that
to my fist?

01:13:42.341 --> 01:13:44.242
Okay, once more with feeling.

01:13:44.277 --> 01:13:45.578
Oh, shit, run!

01:13:47.179 --> 01:13:48.748
That's what I thought.

01:13:50.416 --> 01:13:51.851
Thank you.

01:13:51.884 --> 01:13:54.953
Oh, come on now. Us freaks
have to stick together.

01:13:54.987 --> 01:13:56.956
Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:13:56.989 --> 01:13:59.192
I'll just, like,
go sit or something.

01:14:07.933 --> 01:14:10.636
So, what's going on
with you and Victor?

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:13.206
So, what's going on with you
and that guy from the club?

01:14:15.907 --> 01:14:17.042
So, what's going on
with your friend

01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:18.377
and that guy from the future?

01:14:23.349 --> 01:14:25.318
Come on, I'll take you two
back to the campground.

01:14:31.256 --> 01:14:32.725
Let's go!

01:15:18.203 --> 01:15:19.971
What is it
I hear about a boy?

01:15:20.005 --> 01:15:21.774
I don't trust
his look, Joey!

01:15:21.808 --> 01:15:24.978
Get drunk
and do drugs in our home!

01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:26.211
Feisty little freak!

01:15:26.245 --> 01:15:27.080
What are you doing?

01:15:27.112 --> 01:15:28.780
Are you
ever going to get

01:15:28.814 --> 01:15:31.151
the concept of reapplying?

01:15:31.184 --> 01:15:34.687
Come on now, us
freaks got to stick together.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.122
You two are
so cute together.

01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:38.692
Why are you still
hanging out with him?

01:15:38.724 --> 01:15:40.125
Just help me!

01:15:51.437 --> 01:15:53.006
Sorry about your dad, Joey!

01:15:58.879 --> 01:16:00.613
I bet you're excited
to finally go home.

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.216
Dad?

01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:07.287
Go home?

01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:10.857
Honey, school starts
in a few weeks.

01:16:14.794 --> 01:16:16.196
Wow.

01:16:17.263 --> 01:16:18.931
I don't know, I just...

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:21.735
I guess I didn't think
this summer would end so soon.

01:16:22.868 --> 01:16:24.371
You're going to have
to say goodbye to summer

01:16:24.403 --> 01:16:25.705
sometime, Joey.

01:16:37.916 --> 01:16:39.618
Dad?

01:16:57.136 --> 01:16:58.638
Bye, Molly!

01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:00.739
It was nice
to having Molly over.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:06.245
Oh, any idea what happened
to Victor?

01:17:06.278 --> 01:17:07.746
No idea.

01:17:09.815 --> 01:17:11.684
Oh, your mom called.

01:17:11.716 --> 01:17:14.786
She's definitely gonna make it
back in time for the party.

01:17:14.821 --> 01:17:17.724
Wow! Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

01:17:18.925 --> 01:17:20.393
God!

01:17:24.397 --> 01:17:27.033
Hey, guys!
What are you doing?

01:17:27.065 --> 01:17:29.434
- Sacrificing Virgins?
- What?

01:17:29.468 --> 01:17:31.171
Oh, we're just trying
to decide a band name.

01:17:31.203 --> 01:17:33.773
What do you think
of Sacrificing Virgins?

01:17:33.805 --> 01:17:35.040
It's a little close to home.

01:17:35.075 --> 01:17:37.277
So, not exactly
a deal breaker.

01:17:38.309 --> 01:17:39.678
We have
no idea where Victor is,

01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:41.346
if that's what you're about
to ask us.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:43.382
And even if we heard
a rumor that he was

01:17:43.415 --> 01:17:46.319
at Pandora's,
we certainly wouldn't tell you.

01:17:48.287 --> 01:17:51.123
Oh, the tragic unveiling
of misguided teenage hearts.

01:17:51.157 --> 01:17:52.692
- That's it!
- What's it?

01:17:52.724 --> 01:17:54.993
The Tragic Unveiling
Of Misguided Teenager Hearts.

01:17:55.027 --> 01:17:55.995
That's the name of our band.

01:17:56.028 --> 01:17:57.296
You're a genius.

01:18:08.174 --> 01:18:09.375
Hello?

01:18:09.407 --> 01:18:11.343
Victor, I know you're in here.

01:18:11.376 --> 01:18:12.678
Hello?

01:18:14.246 --> 01:18:17.315
Sorry! Oh, my God. Pandora,
I was just looking for Victor.

01:18:17.349 --> 01:18:20.852
Yeah.
Well, obviously,

01:18:20.885 --> 01:18:22.187
he is not in here.

01:18:23.389 --> 01:18:25.291
But if you leave
my house this instant,

01:18:25.325 --> 01:18:27.358
I promise that I won't call
the cops on you

01:18:27.393 --> 01:18:28.761
for breaking and entering.

01:18:29.929 --> 01:18:31.598
Okay, sorry! My mistake.

01:18:34.433 --> 01:18:36.100
All right, she's gone.

01:18:36.135 --> 01:18:37.971
You can come on now.

01:18:40.706 --> 01:18:41.875
That was close.

01:18:50.282 --> 01:18:52.017
I'm such an idiot.

01:19:01.794 --> 01:19:03.028
Got it!

01:19:07.966 --> 01:19:09.067
Don't tell me
you're having feelings

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.004
for your toys now, are you?

01:19:14.072 --> 01:19:15.340
No.

01:19:19.845 --> 01:19:21.147
Mimi?

01:19:23.416 --> 01:19:24.951
Papa?

01:19:26.452 --> 01:19:27.986
Is anybody home?

01:19:33.893 --> 01:19:35.761
You've reached the
goddess Pen, whatever you say

01:19:35.795 --> 01:19:37.596
after the beep shall
determine your fate.

01:19:38.363 --> 01:19:41.201
Hi, Pen. Um...

01:19:41.233 --> 01:19:42.434
I really need
a friend right now,

01:19:42.468 --> 01:19:44.403
so call me back, okay?

01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:59.419
You've reached
reached Carissa Javitts.

01:19:59.452 --> 01:20:00.920
Please leave your message
after the tone.

01:20:02.287 --> 01:20:03.889
Mom.

01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:07.260
Listen, I know
that you're probably

01:20:07.292 --> 01:20:09.194
at the airport right now,
but, um...

01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:13.232
I need my mother.

01:22:16.455 --> 01:22:17.855
What are you doing here?

01:22:17.889 --> 01:22:19.124
You know.

01:22:20.224 --> 01:22:21.928
Just looking for some trouble.

01:22:23.694 --> 01:22:25.063
So, what are you doing out here
in the middle

01:22:25.098 --> 01:22:26.631
of the night anyway?

01:22:26.665 --> 01:22:28.401
That's a good question.

01:22:28.434 --> 01:22:29.735
You were hoping
Victor would come

01:22:29.768 --> 01:22:31.004
looking for you, maybe?

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:34.372
Another good question.

01:22:34.407 --> 01:22:36.108
Look,
you're not the only one

01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.809
who sat here waiting for him.

01:22:38.844 --> 01:22:41.212
You weren't even gonna be here.

01:22:41.246 --> 01:22:43.149
You punched me
last time I saw you.

01:22:43.181 --> 01:22:46.184
No, you're not invited,
get over it!

01:22:48.254 --> 01:22:50.622
I was pretty
lovesick, too.

01:22:50.656 --> 01:22:52.091
I guess he didn't tell you that.

01:22:53.459 --> 01:22:55.193
Come on,
tell Antonio everything.

01:22:57.028 --> 01:22:58.397
Victor treated me
like I was

01:22:58.430 --> 01:23:00.632
his little summer project.

01:23:00.666 --> 01:23:02.935
I want you
to be perfect.

01:23:05.971 --> 01:23:07.773
Did I even mean
anything to him?

01:23:09.108 --> 01:23:10.142
Well, let's see!

01:23:10.175 --> 01:23:11.876
You're in a graveyard
in the middle of the night

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:13.078
by yourself.

01:23:13.112 --> 01:23:14.913
There's a positively
menacing punk

01:23:14.947 --> 01:23:17.049
with a knife sitting
next to you.

01:23:17.082 --> 01:23:19.786
And Victor's not exactly
looking for you right now.

01:23:19.818 --> 01:23:21.886
Do you know what I mean?

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.221
Yeah! I suppose.

01:23:24.389 --> 01:23:26.023
Now,
can I ask you a question?

01:23:26.058 --> 01:23:27.660
You're the one
with the knife.

01:23:29.228 --> 01:23:32.765
If you're not his project,
then who are you really?

01:23:34.366 --> 01:23:39.272
Come on, you got this,
you're smart, you're hot.

01:23:39.304 --> 01:23:41.239
Don't let some guy tell you
who you are.

01:23:41.273 --> 01:23:44.143
You have to decide for yourself
who you are, you know?

01:23:45.678 --> 01:23:49.113
I've learned one thing
about myself this summer,

01:23:49.147 --> 01:23:51.216
I deserve better than Victor.

01:23:52.684 --> 01:23:53.951
I don't think
that's the only thing

01:23:53.986 --> 01:23:56.054
you learned about yourself
this summer, but, hey,

01:23:56.087 --> 01:23:57.689
That's a good start!

01:23:57.723 --> 01:23:59.858
Yeah.
I guess you're right.

01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:02.059
How did you get to be so wise?

01:24:02.094 --> 01:24:03.996
My mom buys
Oprah magazines,

01:24:04.028 --> 01:24:05.598
I read 'em on the
can sometimes.

01:24:06.864 --> 01:24:08.968
Wait, does that make me gay?

01:24:10.169 --> 01:24:11.304
You got
to decide for yourself

01:24:11.336 --> 01:24:13.004
who you are, you know?

01:24:13.037 --> 01:24:14.172
TouchÃ©!

01:24:20.712 --> 01:24:23.081
Get off my baby
girl! You thug!

01:24:23.114 --> 01:24:25.283
You screwed with
the wrong family.

01:24:25.317 --> 01:24:26.919
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine!

01:24:26.952 --> 01:24:29.254
Your mom called and said you
left a strange message.

01:24:29.287 --> 01:24:31.889
- We were really worried.
- I'm good now, promise,

01:24:31.922 --> 01:24:34.925
no one need worry,
least of all my mother.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.362
Can we please
get out of here?

01:24:36.394 --> 01:24:38.263
I'm like, way claustrophobic.

01:24:38.296 --> 01:24:40.732
Great idea!
When we get to be our age,

01:24:40.765 --> 01:24:44.202
the last place you want
to hang out is the cemetery.

01:24:54.813 --> 01:24:56.415
Where have you guys
been?

01:24:56.447 --> 01:24:58.250
Rescuing teenagers.

01:24:58.283 --> 01:24:59.984
I've been here
for over an hour,

01:25:00.018 --> 01:25:01.886
none of you have your phones on.

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:04.390
Did you get anything
to eat on the plane?

01:25:04.422 --> 01:25:05.992
No, I'm starving.

01:25:06.024 --> 01:25:08.727
Honey,
I'm so glad you're back.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.696
Aww, thanks Mom!

01:25:10.729 --> 01:25:12.964
Listen,
we'll get dinner started,

01:25:12.997 --> 01:25:15.268
so you two can catch up.

01:25:20.872 --> 01:25:22.908
Oh, honey.
It's so good to see you.

01:25:29.648 --> 01:25:30.882
Did you miss me?

01:25:35.453 --> 01:25:37.790
I got your message.

01:25:37.822 --> 01:25:39.224
What was that all about?

01:25:40.658 --> 01:25:42.862
Jesus!
What is it with you?

01:25:42.894 --> 01:25:45.730
You're annoyed if I don't call,
you're annoyed if I do.

01:25:45.764 --> 01:25:47.232
Oh, Joey,
don't start with me.

01:25:48.367 --> 01:25:50.136
You have no idea
how much pressure it is

01:25:50.169 --> 01:25:51.937
to be on a book tour.

01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:54.139
You have no idea
how much pressure it is

01:25:54.171 --> 01:25:55.640
to be 16.

01:25:57.876 --> 01:25:59.745
Like I've never been
a teenager.

01:26:03.415 --> 01:26:07.952
So, what's with all the black?

01:26:07.986 --> 01:26:09.421
I wear black
on the outside,

01:26:09.453 --> 01:26:11.357
because black is how
I feel on the inside.

01:26:12.724 --> 01:26:15.961
That's very dramatic.

01:26:15.995 --> 01:26:17.629
What's his name?

01:26:17.662 --> 01:26:20.398
His name is Victor,
and he broke my heart.

01:26:20.433 --> 01:26:21.966
Thank you very much.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.035
Oh, honey!

01:26:24.068 --> 01:26:27.138
You look like you just came
from a funeral.

01:26:27.171 --> 01:26:28.840
A funeral?

01:26:28.873 --> 01:26:30.175
I kind of just did, Mom!

01:26:30.207 --> 01:26:31.978
You were there too, remember?

01:26:33.112 --> 01:26:36.614
You think
I don't miss him?

01:26:36.648 --> 01:26:39.351
I miss him every single day,

01:26:39.385 --> 01:26:43.188
and I really don't appreciate
you throwing that in my face.

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.924
And I'm sure
your throng of adoring fans

01:26:45.957 --> 01:26:48.227
has helped you through
this grieving process.

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:50.896
That throng
of adoring fans pays

01:26:50.929 --> 01:26:52.998
for your entire life.

01:26:53.031 --> 01:26:54.265
You know,
it wouldn't kill you to show

01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:56.302
just a little bit of gratitude.

01:26:58.903 --> 01:27:00.171
And I'm sorry I wasn't here
to help you

01:27:00.205 --> 01:27:01.940
- with your boy troubles.
- No, no, no, no.

01:27:01.974 --> 01:27:04.076
Let's talk about gratitude
a little bit,

01:27:04.108 --> 01:27:06.946
because you know
what I'm grateful for?

01:27:06.979 --> 01:27:08.847
I'm grateful
that I didn't have to spend

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.017
my summer listening
to your saccharine bullshit.

01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:13.685
You know, I feel sorry
for the shallow idiots

01:27:13.719 --> 01:27:15.688
who read your shitty novels.

01:27:25.831 --> 01:27:27.632
Want dinner?

01:27:30.202 --> 01:27:31.804
I'm not hungry.

01:27:33.237 --> 01:27:34.706
Yeah.

01:27:51.156 --> 01:27:52.658
I hope she wasn't
a total handful

01:27:52.690 --> 01:27:54.827
this summer, Mom.

01:27:54.859 --> 01:27:58.697
I'm probably at least partly
to blame for that.

01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:02.001
Sometimes
we push people away

01:28:02.033 --> 01:28:04.737
and we really should be
pulling them in close.

01:28:06.104 --> 01:28:07.238
- Boo!
- Oh!

01:28:07.273 --> 01:28:10.676
Jesus! Dad!

01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:12.376
What am I going to do
about this new phase, you guys?

01:28:12.411 --> 01:28:15.047
Accept her
for who she is,

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.649
and hope for the best.

01:28:17.683 --> 01:28:18.984
That's what we did

01:28:19.017 --> 01:28:22.421
when you were a Madonna wannabe.

01:28:22.453 --> 01:28:24.755
Look how cool you turned out.

01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:26.056
Come in!

01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:28.893
This way
for the punch and brownies.

01:28:38.269 --> 01:28:41.639
Can you watch the door
for a minute, please?

01:28:41.674 --> 01:28:43.975
We need to get
this party moving, huh.

01:28:48.813 --> 01:28:51.182
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Ireland,
come on in!

01:28:51.215 --> 01:28:54.185
Watch out for the brownies,
there have been rumours.

01:28:54.219 --> 01:28:55.888
Why do you think
we are here, dear?

01:28:58.857 --> 01:29:02.160
I see they'll
let any old vampire in here.

01:29:02.193 --> 01:29:03.728
Hold that thought.

01:29:05.296 --> 01:29:07.031
Surprise!

01:29:07.064 --> 01:29:08.433
What are you
guys doing here?

01:29:08.466 --> 01:29:11.103
Oh, I heard about the party
from these freaks.

01:29:11.135 --> 01:29:12.370
Come on, Tony-Boy,
let's get some punch

01:29:12.403 --> 01:29:13.839
and frighten the old people.

01:29:20.045 --> 01:29:24.149
So, where did you
disappear to the other night?

01:29:24.183 --> 01:29:25.651
Is that a joke?

01:29:25.684 --> 01:29:28.887
I left you like
a dozen voicemails.

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.055
I missed you too, my pet.

01:29:30.087 --> 01:29:31.857
I did not say
that I missed you.

01:29:33.224 --> 01:29:35.093
No, I cannot believe
that I fell for you.

01:29:35.126 --> 01:29:37.361
I mean, what a total waste
of a summer.

01:29:37.395 --> 01:29:41.300
I turned you into something
almost borderline interesting.

01:29:41.332 --> 01:29:43.100
- You should be thanking me.
- Really?

01:29:43.135 --> 01:29:46.672
- Hey! Are you Victor?
- Mom, not now!

01:29:46.705 --> 01:29:50.175
Oh, this is your mother,
the famous novelist.

01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:53.711
Mrs. Javitts, it's an honour,
I am a huge fan.

01:29:53.745 --> 01:29:54.913
So, you read my book?

01:29:54.947 --> 01:29:56.248
Absolutely! Every one.

01:29:56.281 --> 01:29:58.384
Well,
that makes complete sense then!

01:30:00.019 --> 01:30:01.120
How's that?

01:30:01.153 --> 01:30:03.622
Because my daughter says
that my books are written

01:30:03.656 --> 01:30:05.123
for shallow idiots.

01:30:08.359 --> 01:30:11.697
I'm sorry, did you just call
me a shallow idiot?

01:30:11.729 --> 01:30:13.064
I'm just saying
that my daughter

01:30:13.099 --> 01:30:15.267
is right more often
than I would like to admit.

01:30:16.768 --> 01:30:17.736
In fact, you know,

01:30:17.769 --> 01:30:19.304
I think I can do better
than shallow idiot.

01:30:19.337 --> 01:30:21.040
If I were to describe you
in one of my novels,

01:30:21.072 --> 01:30:24.108
I think I'd call you
a vainglorious egomaniacal

01:30:24.142 --> 01:30:25.777
narcissist.

01:30:25.810 --> 01:30:28.714
You are but a phase,
my dear boy.

01:30:28.746 --> 01:30:31.048
A mere case
of temporary proctalgia,

01:30:31.082 --> 01:30:33.818
cleared up by a tube
of drugstore haemorrhoid cream.

01:30:33.852 --> 01:30:35.621
Ooh!

01:30:35.653 --> 01:30:37.855
So, I think you better go.

01:30:37.889 --> 01:30:40.893
Oh, and Victor.
Time to reapply!

01:30:45.362 --> 01:30:46.698
Where did that come from?

01:30:48.466 --> 01:30:49.801
A wise woman once told me

01:30:49.835 --> 01:30:51.303
that sometimes
we push people away

01:30:51.336 --> 01:30:54.773
when we got
to bring them closer.

01:30:54.806 --> 01:30:57.041
I just want you to know
that I'm always on your side.

01:30:59.176 --> 01:31:01.912
By the way, proctalgia?

01:31:01.947 --> 01:31:04.783
Just another medical term
for pain in the ass.

01:31:04.815 --> 01:31:07.952
It's another thing
your grandmother taught me.

01:31:07.986 --> 01:31:11.689
So, you guys, the big news is,

01:31:11.723 --> 01:31:14.193
that I'm gonna cancel
the second half of my book tour.

01:31:14.225 --> 01:31:16.126
Really, dear?
Is that wise?

01:31:16.161 --> 01:31:19.264
You don't have
to do that for me, Mom.

01:31:19.297 --> 01:31:21.099
Yeah, I do.

01:31:23.068 --> 01:31:25.371
Are you guys ready
to get this party started?

01:31:27.773 --> 01:31:29.708
This thing on? Hi!

01:31:29.741 --> 01:31:32.077
I would just like to welcome
everyone and to congratulate

01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:34.813
my amazing grandparents,
Joseph and Margaret,

01:31:34.845 --> 01:31:36.747
on 40 years of marriage.

01:31:38.215 --> 01:31:40.419
Now, without further ado,
I am proud to introduce

01:31:40.452 --> 01:31:43.222
my new favourite band, ah...

01:31:43.255 --> 01:31:45.991
The Tragic Unveiling
of Misguided Teenage Hearts.

01:31:46.023 --> 01:31:50.094
Congrats, you crazy kids!
This song is for you.

01:31:52.429 --> 01:31:53.831
One, two, three.

01:32:05.144 --> 01:32:07.112
I remember
how excited I was

01:32:07.144 --> 01:32:10.114
for my fifth birthday party.

01:32:10.148 --> 01:32:13.151
Then when the kids showed up,
I hid in my room,

01:32:13.184 --> 01:32:15.320
wouldn't come out.

01:32:15.353 --> 01:32:18.924
You held my hands
and said, "Joey,

01:32:18.956 --> 01:32:22.627
"you will meet many people
in this astonishing

01:32:22.661 --> 01:32:25.797
"and wonderful life of yours,
and you'll know

01:32:25.831 --> 01:32:27.867
when your true friends appear."

01:32:29.835 --> 01:32:32.104
This is how I will
always remember

01:32:32.136 --> 01:32:36.140
my summer as a goth,
dancing with my mom

01:32:36.174 --> 01:32:39.711
and my grandparents
and a group of new friends

01:32:39.745 --> 01:32:42.081
that actually get me.

01:32:42.113 --> 01:32:45.384
Astonishing and wonderful,
indeed.

01:32:45.416 --> 01:32:46.884
Who would have guessed?

01:32:50.087 --> 01:32:51.756
Hey!

01:32:57.395 --> 01:33:01.300
So, you're a goth now?

01:33:01.332 --> 01:33:04.102
I didn't even know
goths still existed.

01:33:04.135 --> 01:33:06.238
I don't know what I am.

01:33:06.270 --> 01:33:10.608
Hey Aaron!
You've been replaced.

01:33:10.642 --> 01:33:13.111
Your new boyfriend
looks kind of gay.

01:33:13.144 --> 01:33:14.947
Oh, shut up, Shelley!

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.011
Hey, Dad. I have some
friends I want you to meet.

01:34:49.675 --> 01:34:51.076
Standing
someone up for those

01:34:51.108 --> 01:34:53.411
or similar reasons
is inexcusable.

01:34:53.444 --> 01:34:56.113
Mind you, no one
is owed a date ever.

01:34:56.148 --> 01:34:57.950
The only reason
you should accept a date

01:34:57.983 --> 01:35:00.319
or whatever you want
to call romantic social activity

01:35:00.352 --> 01:35:02.854
between two people,
is because you are interested

01:35:02.888 --> 01:35:04.154
in spending time together.

01:35:04.188 --> 01:35:06.023
You don't have to go out
with someone just

01:35:06.058 --> 01:35:08.694
because he or she is nice,
pays attention to you

01:35:08.727 --> 01:35:10.028
or seems to expect it.

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:12.130
Nor should you feel obliged
to go out with someone,

01:35:12.163 --> 01:35:15.099
because you are single goths
who know each other,

01:35:15.132 --> 01:35:16.734
you may scoff, snarklings,

01:35:16.768 --> 01:35:19.638
but the Lady of the Manners has
seen that exact thing happened

01:35:19.670 --> 01:35:21.172
with alarming regularity.
