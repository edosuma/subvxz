Do you feel like 'cause you a white boy...

04:46.780 --> 04:48.364
you got to overcompensate sometimes.

04:48.657 --> 04:52.159
Wow! Wow! You got me all

04:52.369 --> 04:55.621
Yeah, I might be Montel, but you're the one
gettin' all Jerry Springer all the time.

04:56.831 --> 05:00.084
Yo' check this out. You Montel,
you Jerry Springer, and I'm like...

05:00.293 --> 05:01.043
Jenny Jones.

05:01.419 --> 05:03.629
Naw, naw, he's like Ellen.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.297
Except Ellen gets more chicks than he gets.

05:06.758 --> 05:07.675
Man, shut up.

05:11.179 --> 05:12.972
Yo' I can't believe...

05:13.682 --> 05:15.599
Hold up. That's P.J...

05:19.437 --> 05:20.479

05:25.277 --> 05:26.610
I ain't afraid of him!

05:26.945 --> 05:29.905
Yo', you waited until the car got all the way
around the corner before you threw something.

05:30.115 --> 05:31.115
Ya', that's real brave.

05:31.324 --> 05:33.367
Check this out man, I
ain't afraid of nobody.

05:33.577 --> 05:34.702
I ain't afraid of you.

05:34.911 --> 05:37.621
And I'm definitely not afraid of you!

05:38.707 --> 05:39.540
Why you runnin' then!

05:39.791 --> 05:40.708

Hey yo', come on man.

05:52.679 --> 05:53.721

05:54.639 --> 05:55.598
It's a school man.

05:56.057 --> 05:56.932
It don't look like no school.

05:57.142 --> 05:58.642
It is a school. I'll show you.

05:59.728 --> 06:00.894
Skinny!

06:03.815 --> 06:04.773
Man, are you going to let him go in there?

06:04.983 --> 06:06.775
Man, he's your brother, you go get him.

06:07.027 --> 06:07.776
Come on.

06:07.777 --> 06:09.653
- I ain't goin' in there.
- Man, come on!

06:16.870 --> 06:18.329
What'd you do that for man!

06:20.707 --> 06:22.166
This looks like a museum.

06:22.584 --> 06:24.251
It's not a museum.

06:29.758 --> 06:31.592
Hey look look, Skinny was
right, this is a school.

06:32.802 --> 06:33.594
- Art school.
- I told you.

06:33.803 --> 06:35.220
All right, then who goes here then?

06:35.597 --> 06:37.181
Looks like some stuck up rich folks.

06:37.390 --> 06:38.724
Yo', look at these dudes.

06:39.309 --> 06:40.726
They're all sweet with their shirts off.

06:40.935 --> 06:42.645
Tight like they spray painted them on.

06:42.854 --> 06:45.939
Yeah, they do show off
their muscles pretty nice though.

06:48.318 --> 06:49.193
No man...

06:49.402 --> 06:50.611
Whatever, don't touch me.

06:50.820 --> 06:52.196
Mac, I'm just saying that...

06:52.405 --> 06:53.322
Don't touch me...

06:53.323 --> 06:55.491
They in good shape, that's all.

06:55.700 --> 06:56.784
We need to get you a girl, fast.

06:56.993 --> 06:59.828
Man, I got girls! I just
don't show them to you.

07:00.038 --> 07:00.412
Why?

07:00.622 --> 07:01.914
'Cause I don't want you
to try and take them.

07:02.123 --> 07:02.956
What are you talkin' about?

07:03.166 --> 07:05.000
Hey yo', hey check this out.

07:08.046 --> 07:09.463
Man, look at this place.

07:09.673 --> 07:11.757
Yo', we ain't got nothing
like this in our school.

07:11.966 --> 07:13.509
That's 'cause our school is broke!

07:13.927 --> 07:15.177
Hey yo, wait up.

07:15.762 --> 07:17.388
Man, these rich kids get everything.

07:17.597 --> 07:20.432
Man, what is this man,
this looks like a playground to me.

07:21.559 --> 07:25.437
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro...

07:26.064 --> 07:27.022
Look at this stuff.

07:28.066 --> 07:29.316
Let's bounce man.

07:33.446 --> 07:34.988
Come on man, it was an accident.

07:36.241 --> 07:38.784
Don't worry, these rich
kids can afford this.

07:39.035 --> 07:40.077
Look...

08:02.767 --> 08:04.226
I win!

08:09.274 --> 08:10.441
Not funny man!

08:23.037 --> 08:24.288
Having fun!

08:24.581 --> 08:26.290
Get off me! Get off me!

08:26.458 --> 08:27.708
You're going to come with me.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.002
Get off me!

08:30.170 --> 08:31.837
Get off of me! Come on!

08:32.046 --> 08:33.172
Go! Go! Go!

08:37.427 --> 08:38.427
Yo Ty'!

08:38.635 --> 08:40.304
Yo', just go! Go!

08:42.640 --> 08:43.515
Very noble.

08:43.725 --> 08:45.017
Shut up rent a cop!

08:49.355 --> 08:50.564
Breaking and entering.

08:50.774 --> 08:53.567
Vandalism at the Maryland
School of the Arts.

08:54.319 --> 08:55.486
Are you a student there?

08:57.489 --> 08:58.322
No.

08:58.323 --> 09:00.449
I see you've been in this court room
several times before.

09:00.658 --> 09:02.117
Where are your foster parents?

09:03.286 --> 09:04.912
Can you answer me with a sentence.

09:05.121 --> 09:07.331
I don't know, I think my foster mom's
trying to get off work.

09:07.540 --> 09:08.415
Okay, Mister Gains look...

09:08.583 --> 09:12.336
This is the way we play the game here.
You break it, you buy it.

09:12.545 --> 09:15.005
200 hours of community
service to be performed...

09:15.173 --> 09:16.131
at the scene of the offense.

09:16.341 --> 09:18.383
Maryland School of the Art.

09:30.355 --> 09:31.980
I got here as fast as I could.

09:48.039 --> 09:48.956
We're back!

09:49.249 --> 09:50.165
What'd he get?

09:50.333 --> 09:52.084
200 hours community service.

09:52.293 --> 09:54.253
He won't make it, he's never stayed
with anything in his life.

09:54.462 --> 09:57.631
Why do you care. You get
your check every month.

09:57.841 --> 09:58.632
Kids, wash up.

09:58.842 --> 09:59.675
What'd you say?

10:01.511 --> 10:06.139
Slow down, slow down. You'll make him all dizzy.
He's not even drunk yet.

10:06.266 --> 10:10.143
Come on, let's have a nice dinner
before I have to go back to work.

10:10.395 --> 10:11.520
I'm not hungry.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.750
Are you going to prison?

10:34.586 --> 10:36.753
How many times do I have to tell you,
just to knock.

10:36.921 --> 10:37.796
Because that's where my Dad is.

10:38.006 --> 10:40.173
At the Supermax, but he
liked it better at Jessup.

10:40.425 --> 10:42.885
No Camille, I'm not going to prison.

10:43.136 --> 10:46.597
But they are going to have to take me
to prison if you don't start knocking.

10:47.724 --> 10:48.765
Get outta here...

12:23.319 --> 12:24.778
Excuse me...

12:38.793 --> 12:43.588
I see, we were hoping to link
the fundraiser to the fall showcase.

12:44.298 --> 12:47.426
So we absolutely can't do it on Friday.

12:48.928 --> 12:50.429
I'm Tyler Gage, I'm here...

12:50.596 --> 12:52.431
Come in, Mister Gage. Take a seat.

12:52.640 --> 12:56.560
We'll just have to move the event to March
and hope that the press comes through.

12:56.728 --> 12:57.978
Thanks Denise.

13:06.696 --> 13:10.198
Well I see that you're
overwhelmed with remorse.

13:11.492 --> 13:14.244
You have no idea of the consequences
of your actions.

13:14.412 --> 13:15.495
Do you?

13:15.997 --> 13:18.582
Yeah, 200 hours.

13:18.833 --> 13:21.168
Actually there's a little more to it.

13:21.627 --> 13:24.296
Most of our students are
here on Scholarships.

13:24.589 --> 13:27.466
The cost of repairing the
damage that you did.

13:27.675 --> 13:29.968
Is roughly the equivalent
of one student's tuition.

13:30.178 --> 13:32.554
Do you understand what that means?

13:34.932 --> 13:37.559
You just cost someone their future.

13:39.312 --> 13:40.270
Sorry...

13:42.190 --> 13:44.608
Look, I'm just here to do my hours.

13:49.781 --> 13:52.783
Is says here that your
school day finishes at two.

13:52.992 --> 13:57.454
Per the court's order,
you're to report here and stay until 5:30.

13:58.122 --> 14:00.540
Now if you'll follow me Mister Gage.

14:01.042 --> 14:04.795
I have someone who is
very eager to meet you.

14:13.554 --> 14:15.013
Mr. McCaffery.

14:15.181 --> 14:15.889
Director Gordon.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.599
This is Tyler Gage.

14:17.850 --> 14:22.896
Your new intern. I'd like a daily report
on his activities.

14:23.189 --> 14:25.774
All right, here you go.

14:36.911 --> 14:43.708
4, 5, 6... and... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and...

14:57.181 --> 14:59.307
Ahh, hello. Who is that?

15:02.228 --> 15:03.645
Come on, he is fine.

15:04.605 --> 15:06.064
Don't you have a boyfriend?

15:06.274 --> 15:09.651
Yes, and my boyfriend
would appreciate my good taste.

15:31.090 --> 15:31.923
Hey.

15:32.717 --> 15:33.508
Hey.

15:42.935 --> 15:44.728
Good job!

15:48.357 --> 15:50.066
So I'll see you at rehearsal, okay Andrew.

15:50.318 --> 15:51.568
Yeah, see ya.

15:56.908 --> 15:57.782
Hey baby.

15:57.992 --> 15:58.909
Hey.

15:59.952 --> 16:00.827
Walk you to your next class?

16:00.995 --> 16:03.413
Yeah. Just need to stop by my locker first.

16:04.290 --> 16:04.873
How are you?

16:05.082 --> 16:06.708
Good. How was class?

16:06.918 --> 16:07.918
It was good.

16:08.169 --> 16:10.670
Hey guys, is that our new janitor?

16:11.589 --> 16:12.756
He's not a janitor...

16:12.924 --> 16:14.591
That's the guy who trashed the theater.

16:14.926 --> 16:15.967
Really?

16:16.594 --> 16:19.429
Ohh... I love a man in a uniform.

16:30.107 --> 16:32.484
Hey, you in the garbage man jumpsuit.

16:32.693 --> 16:34.361
When you're done with that
how about a wash and wax?

16:34.820 --> 16:37.822
You all better cool out with that.
I know that car belongs to somebody.

16:37.990 --> 16:38.782
Of course it does.

16:38.908 --> 16:40.992
That's why we're going to leave it here
for you to drive over to Omar's.

16:41.202 --> 16:43.662
And make sure he pay us
for the last car we brought him.

16:44.455 --> 16:45.121
What's up man.

16:45.331 --> 16:49.125
Man, look at this thing, man.
It's got plastic fenders.

16:50.544 --> 16:51.878
What's up with the girls here man.

16:52.088 --> 16:55.340
Damn... they look like the girls
from the Candy shop video.

16:55.549 --> 16:58.468
They might look like them, man,
but they don't dance like them.

16:58.678 --> 17:00.845
Oh yeah, so you been workin' them out?

17:01.055 --> 17:03.890
I've been workin' them out.
I've been like...

17:14.777 --> 17:16.194
So what do they do?

17:26.163 --> 17:27.539
Hey yo', what did they do after that?

17:27.748 --> 17:28.999
Oh my God, can you stop thinking about...

17:29.208 --> 17:31.626
the senior showcase for like,
one second, please. One second...

17:31.836 --> 17:33.503
It's not just that. It's everything.

17:33.713 --> 17:38.008
Nora... Nora... Look got a
track for the showcase.

17:39.176 --> 17:41.928
Same tempo, same rhythm
as the track you got now.

17:42.346 --> 17:44.973
I really believe this
will take your routine to the next level.

17:45.516 --> 17:46.558
Next level?

17:46.767 --> 17:47.600
Yeah...

17:48.519 --> 17:49.853
Thanks Miles.

17:50.313 --> 17:51.563
Nora, listen...

17:51.772 --> 17:53.690
It's not that you're not already
at the next level, you know what mean...

17:53.983 --> 17:55.942
Quit while you're ahead Miles, just stop.

17:56.152 --> 17:58.361
And you, you just need to stop
and take a breath or something...

17:58.571 --> 17:59.904
because you're starting to make me nervous.

18:00.156 --> 18:01.489
I know, I'm must stressed.

18:02.033 --> 18:04.034
You need a break,
Colin's playing on Saturday night...

18:04.243 --> 18:06.411
so you need to come,
because you haven't been in forever.

18:06.662 --> 18:08.121
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Who's Colin?

18:08.372 --> 18:09.831
Lucy's older boyfriend.

18:10.041 --> 18:11.958
He's sophisticated, a real man.

18:12.168 --> 18:13.126
A real man.

18:13.419 --> 18:17.005
He's about to be surrounded by a whole
lot of real men when he goes to jail.

18:17.423 --> 18:20.258
How long have you had
your license, 6 months,

18:20.468 --> 18:23.928
I am very mature for my age. Thank you.

18:24.555 --> 18:27.557
Oh that's great.
That's so perfect for the witness stand.

19:21.612 --> 19:23.780
When are you going to stop changing the
music, Miles, she's already freaked out.

19:25.116 --> 19:26.116
Nora, come on.

19:26.492 --> 19:27.951
Just go. Just go.

19:41.507 --> 19:42.132
They got that.

19:42.341 --> 19:43.133
Tired of getting dawged on yet?

19:43.342 --> 19:44.217
Oh yeah.

19:44.427 --> 19:45.510
Let's go.

20:09.702 --> 20:11.286
Mac? Mac...

20:18.085 --> 20:20.879
Where my money at baby!
Where my money at! Hey!

20:24.217 --> 20:26.844
That's wonderful Jack, congratulations.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.013
You're late.

20:29.473 --> 20:30.347
Not really...

20:30.557 --> 20:32.057
No? You're just so eager to get to work...

20:32.267 --> 20:34.018
you're just sprinting off
to the supply closet.

20:34.186 --> 20:37.229
It's like 15 minutes,
don't I get a grace period or something?

20:37.689 --> 20:40.399
You've neither earned one
nor are you entitled.

20:40.567 --> 20:42.485
But you can stay 15 minutes later.

20:52.662 --> 20:54.705
Andrew, oh my God, what happened?

20:54.873 --> 20:56.832
Came down on my ankle wrong in class today.

20:57.042 --> 20:57.833
Are you okay?

20:58.043 --> 20:59.502
Yeah. It's just a sprain.

20:59.711 --> 21:02.171
Nurse says I have to stay off of it.
I'm sorry.

21:03.381 --> 21:04.965
For what, it's not your fault.

21:05.175 --> 21:08.886
I know Nora, but it's just that the showcase
means a lot to both of us, you know.

21:09.304 --> 21:12.056
Maybe you could find somebody
to rehearse with in the meantime.

21:12.432 --> 21:15.017
I should be back before you know it.

21:15.310 --> 21:18.771
Yeah, don't worry about it. I'll be okay.

21:19.397 --> 21:22.566
All right, cool. See you later.

21:22.817 --> 21:23.734
Okay.

22:24.296 --> 22:25.212
What's up man.

22:26.506 --> 22:27.464
What's up.

22:28.466 --> 22:29.592
Where you from?

22:30.719 --> 22:32.428
I grew up in McCulloh Homes.

22:32.679 --> 22:35.139
Oh word. That's where my boy Maccy's from.

22:35.348 --> 22:37.141
He lives over at Heritage now.

22:37.309 --> 22:38.225
Oh yeah.

22:38.476 --> 22:41.103
I don't live over there no more.
I live with my Aunt now.

22:41.313 --> 22:43.439
Right on, I'll check you later.

22:43.648 --> 22:45.691
Later.

22:46.568 --> 22:47.735
He only has a bad sprain...

22:47.944 --> 22:50.112
I just need someone to rehearse with
until he gets better.

22:50.280 --> 22:53.490
You know all the stuff I have going on
with the labels and everything.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.451
How come Miles can find
the time to help me out.

22:55.660 --> 22:58.871
No offense to Miles, but he's not as involved
in every aspect of the music as I am.

22:59.914 --> 23:02.207
Look, all I need is somebody, Brett...

23:02.417 --> 23:05.210
to rehearse with, just for couple of week.

23:05.420 --> 23:08.881
I want to help you, you know I do.
I'm just so close with my music...

23:09.090 --> 23:11.008
I got to give it everything I have.

23:11.843 --> 23:14.678
You're gonna do great. You always do.

23:16.431 --> 23:17.264
Yeah.

23:17.682 --> 23:18.974
All right sweetie.

23:39.663 --> 23:44.041
Thank you guy so much
for coming to the audition. Ready?

23:46.670 --> 23:47.920
I'm not ready yet.

23:57.972 --> 23:59.056
Thank you...

24:09.234 --> 24:11.777
See, it's not that hard.

24:23.540 --> 24:24.415
No...

24:28.878 --> 24:29.712
Thank you.

24:40.265 --> 24:42.141
Thank you. Thanks.

24:59.951 --> 25:00.993
I'll do it.

25:02.954 --> 25:04.079
Do what?

25:04.539 --> 25:08.292
I don't know, whatever you all were
trying to do out here.

25:09.210 --> 25:11.837
You want to lift me? Are you kidding?

25:12.547 --> 25:14.131
Does it look like I'm kidding?

25:15.675 --> 25:20.179
Okay, I get it. You're not going to
use me to get out of cleaning the window.

25:20.555 --> 25:22.639
Even if you were capable of dancing.

25:22.849 --> 25:24.725
Okay, well I'm not trying
to get out of anything.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.019
And I know you saw me the other day.

25:29.647 --> 25:32.983
Thank you, but umm... I
can find someone else.

25:35.987 --> 25:39.323
I was just trying to help.

25:43.369 --> 25:44.328
Okay, wait.

25:49.375 --> 25:50.209
Catch me.

25:59.677 --> 26:00.677
Now what?

26:01.012 --> 26:03.347
Put me down.

26:04.057 --> 26:06.266
No. What about Craig Raffen's solo.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.185
I don't have time to work out a solo.

26:08.394 --> 26:09.686
Not a good one anyway.

26:09.896 --> 26:11.730
Well have you talked to the sophomores?

26:11.898 --> 26:14.858
I've auditioned a bunch of them.
None of them can handle it.

26:15.026 --> 26:17.694
My dance has a lot of lifts in it.
And you know how hard...

26:19.113 --> 26:20.697
I can't believe there's no one else.

26:20.865 --> 26:22.407
None who have the time.

26:23.827 --> 26:26.203
And you say that he can dance?

26:26.621 --> 26:28.038
He's adequate.

26:28.748 --> 26:29.832
Adequate?

26:30.041 --> 26:33.544
See that's my concern.
He's not taking this seriously.

26:33.753 --> 26:39.967
Look, I'm sorry. It's just you're all talking about
dancing like it's rocket science or somethin'.

26:41.052 --> 26:42.803
It's just for a couple of weeks.

26:42.971 --> 26:44.429
Until Andrew gets better.

26:44.597 --> 26:45.514
Yeah.

26:46.558 --> 26:48.934
This would be your risk, Nora.

26:50.228 --> 26:51.854
It's your Senior piece.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.605
I know.

26:54.858 --> 26:57.401
Don't make me regret my decision.

27:00.572 --> 27:02.906
2:30 tomorrow, bring your tights.

27:03.992 --> 27:05.909
Tights? Wait... What?

27:08.454 --> 27:10.163
I'm going to beat you. I have...

27:12.375 --> 27:14.543
Anything interesting happen
at school today, Tyler?

27:14.752 --> 27:16.086
Malcolm, enough!

27:16.588 --> 27:17.421
No.

27:17.755 --> 27:18.714
Sit down.

27:20.425 --> 27:21.341
Eat...

27:28.975 --> 27:30.809
Anything special at school today?

27:31.185 --> 27:33.604
I found a new rehearsal
partner for the showcase.

27:33.771 --> 27:37.274
So now I won't miss a beat
when Andrew gets back.

27:38.109 --> 27:40.193
Your applications arrived today
for Cornell and Brown,

27:40.445 --> 27:41.695
I put them on your bed.

27:43.406 --> 27:46.992
Remember our deal, Nora.
If you don't get a job from the showcase...

27:47.201 --> 27:48.785
you got to school in the fall.

27:50.705 --> 27:51.747
Okay...

28:16.314 --> 28:17.397
I'm not late.

28:18.232 --> 28:21.652
You're not dressed either.
You can change in the bathroom.

28:25.657 --> 28:26.531
Done.

28:27.033 --> 28:28.659
I asked you to bring tights.

28:28.993 --> 28:30.827
Do I look like I own tights?

28:31.621 --> 28:32.663
Shoes?

28:33.289 --> 28:34.122
Move better with them on.

28:34.332 --> 28:35.666
Aren't you afraid you might slip and fall?

28:43.257 --> 28:44.508
All right, how do you want to do this?

28:44.676 --> 28:46.677
I'll start with a combination.

28:53.518 --> 28:58.146
Okay... Step knee... step fan...
step, turn...

28:58.356 --> 29:00.232
change, contract.

29:03.403 --> 29:04.486
Okay.

29:06.364 --> 29:07.698
I'll take it slow.

29:09.158 --> 29:14.663
And... step knee, step fan... and...

29:14.872 --> 29:15.872
you got that?

29:16.249 --> 29:17.249
Yeah.

29:17.458 --> 29:22.963
Start with the fan...
turn, change, contract.

29:24.716 --> 29:28.719
Okay. Let's do it again.

29:29.595 --> 29:31.555
5, 6, 7, 8...

29:31.764 --> 29:33.265
Step knee...

29:34.392 --> 29:35.225
My bad...

29:36.561 --> 29:37.853
So...

29:39.147 --> 29:39.855
Go.

29:40.106 --> 29:42.274
Step knee... fan...

29:42.483 --> 29:43.900
Wow...

29:45.945 --> 29:47.404
He looks like the real deal.

29:48.406 --> 29:49.322
Take a break baby.

29:49.532 --> 29:50.240
Grab a coffee.

29:50.241 --> 29:52.159
I can't... I have a lot to do.

29:52.535 --> 29:53.618
How's this day job?

29:53.911 --> 29:54.578
Brett...

29:54.787 --> 29:55.787
I'm sorry, you got a problem?

29:56.748 --> 29:59.249
No. No, I'm all about rehabilitation.

29:59.417 --> 30:01.501
Because we could discuss
this outside if you like.

30:02.003 --> 30:02.711
Why do you think you're so tough.

30:02.920 --> 30:03.545
Why don't you test me.

30:03.755 --> 30:04.671
Okay, stop!

30:05.631 --> 30:08.675
Brett, everything's okay. All right.

30:08.885 --> 30:10.135
I'll meet you later.

30:12.013 --> 30:12.929
Okay.

30:13.139 --> 30:14.139
Okay.

30:26.944 --> 30:27.778
What?

30:27.945 --> 30:28.862
Again.

30:30.114 --> 30:30.739
And...

30:44.295 --> 30:47.339
Omar! Your boys are here!

30:53.471 --> 30:54.971
Look what we got you man!

30:57.391 --> 30:58.391
What's up baby.

31:00.770 --> 31:02.938
Hey man, I heard you
havin' a party on Friday.

31:03.523 --> 31:04.981
Yeah, you know we up in there.

31:05.149 --> 31:08.652
No. You dude's is froze out.

31:08.903 --> 31:10.320
Especially after what happened last time.

31:10.571 --> 31:11.655
What you mean, we froze out?

31:11.823 --> 31:14.116
Come on man, you know I ain't
even start that. That was P.J.

31:14.325 --> 31:16.993
That ain't even right, man.
Look, we can take this car to Stucky.

31:17.203 --> 31:18.370
Probably get more money, too.

31:18.704 --> 31:23.083
I'm sorry, yeah...
You could take this car to Stucky's...

31:24.502 --> 31:27.504
You know something, Mac?
You young dudes, man...

31:27.672 --> 31:28.880
you ain't got no respect.

31:29.090 --> 31:31.675
No loyalty. Matter of fact...
why don't you...

31:31.884 --> 31:34.803
bring me back an Escalade or something,
to get back on my good graces.

31:35.012 --> 31:35.554
We just got you this car...

31:35.805 --> 31:37.097
An Escalade! Or something!

31:37.306 --> 31:38.473
Yeah, we'll get you an Escalade, man.

31:38.641 --> 31:39.850
I'm sorry, what did you say?

31:41.227 --> 31:42.477
Yeah, nothing...

31:43.354 --> 31:44.938
So, can I still come to the party?

31:45.106 --> 31:46.273
Skinny, come on!

31:46.482 --> 31:48.108
He didn't say nothin' about me.

31:48.359 --> 31:52.362
He said you all couldn't go to the party.
Nothin' about Skinny. Nothin'.

31:52.572 --> 31:53.572
Will you shut up!

31:54.198 --> 31:54.948
Ready,

31:55.158 --> 31:58.451
down... up... step... turn...

31:58.828 --> 31:59.786
Pique...

31:59.996 --> 32:01.705
What the Hell is a pique.

32:02.248 --> 32:03.748
This is a pique.

32:04.709 --> 32:05.709
We do the turn,

32:05.918 --> 32:07.919
and land face to face. Okay?

32:08.838 --> 32:10.380
I get it, I get it.

32:10.548 --> 32:11.715
- It's just...
- What?

32:12.175 --> 32:15.218
It's just this... This
whole thing is stiff.

32:15.386 --> 32:16.469
And it's boring.

32:16.929 --> 32:18.054
Boring?

32:18.764 --> 32:21.766
Yeah, don't look at me like I'm stupid,
I know, you know what I'm saying.

32:23.477 --> 32:26.396
Fine, then that's the way it is.

32:26.981 --> 32:27.981
Fine.

32:28.816 --> 32:30.525
Ready... And...

32:30.693 --> 32:31.985
Down... Up...

32:32.195 --> 32:34.487
Step... turn... pique...

32:34.655 --> 32:35.280
And...

32:36.365 --> 32:37.449
Like this?

32:38.576 --> 32:40.577
Okay, I am starving!

32:44.749 --> 32:47.334
Tyler's just here until Andrew's back.

32:47.501 --> 32:49.920
And why is this the first time
I'm hearing about it.

32:53.090 --> 32:54.424
We still have work to do.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.635
I can't watch, is he that bad? Tell me!

32:56.761 --> 32:57.928
Good bye!

32:59.096 --> 33:00.138
Okay.

33:07.480 --> 33:10.607
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

33:10.775 --> 33:12.442
All right, and I'll see you tomorrow.

33:13.027 --> 33:14.069
Okay.

33:16.906 --> 33:20.575
Listen, can you just come to the club
and hear me sing with Colin on Saturday.

33:20.785 --> 33:22.077
Maybe you can bring Tyler.

33:22.286 --> 33:24.287
Will you stop talking about how hot he is.

33:24.455 --> 33:26.373
Okay, Brett's not around so...

33:26.540 --> 33:29.209
Why do you keep denying the obvious.
It's so obvious.

33:29.377 --> 33:32.128
Okay fine, Tyler's good looking.
But he's annoying.

33:32.630 --> 33:36.549
See, your guard's up,
and that must mean you like him.

33:36.759 --> 33:38.343
You couldn't be more wrong.

33:39.595 --> 33:45.725
And defensive too.
That must mean you really, really like him.

33:46.102 --> 33:47.560
I'm just saying.

33:49.522 --> 33:51.982
Oh look, Miles sent me another MP3.

33:52.191 --> 33:54.359
Oh, better listen to it now,

33:55.194 --> 33:57.570
because you know he'll be calling you
in five minutes asking you what you think.

33:58.322 --> 34:00.740
You know you've been getting on
Miles case a lot lately.

34:00.950 --> 34:02.367
Because he's irritating.

34:03.703 --> 34:06.162
Defensive, wait, what does that mean again?

34:06.706 --> 34:08.748
Just listen to the track, okay?

34:16.674 --> 34:17.507
It's good.

34:18.426 --> 34:19.384
Whatever...

35:21.989 --> 35:22.906
Sorry!

35:50.393 --> 35:51.059
What's next.

36:28.264 --> 36:32.559
Lena got Captain Crunch.
Peanut butter Captain Crunch.

36:33.102 --> 36:34.060
Told ya' she likes us.

36:34.270 --> 36:35.895
Camille, get outta here.

36:37.022 --> 36:37.939
Fine.

36:41.152 --> 36:43.486
Camille? Come here.

36:46.824 --> 36:48.616
You gonna give me a little bit of that?

36:50.786 --> 36:54.122
One bite. One. One bite.

36:56.375 --> 36:59.919
Hurry up. That was the biggest bite
I've ever seen!

37:00.671 --> 37:05.341
Get your own! I spit on that spoon...

37:05.551 --> 37:07.010
Yeah, now you give it back!

37:07.553 --> 37:08.970
What? What is this?

37:09.180 --> 37:10.555
That's a sliding scale.

37:10.723 --> 37:11.639
What's does that mean?

37:11.849 --> 37:15.059
That means, I score more points that you,
so I get more money than you.

37:15.269 --> 37:18.855
No, no, no. What about my assist.
I was droppin' dimes today.

37:19.148 --> 37:20.648
Man you tripped over your own shoes.

37:20.816 --> 37:23.359
Twice... but you rolled out of
the second one pretty nice.

37:23.569 --> 37:24.861
You played it off pretty cool.

37:25.571 --> 37:27.322
Man, all I know is you better give me
some of that money.

37:27.490 --> 37:28.031
What?

37:28.199 --> 37:30.700
Yo' it's getting kind of
late, I got to bounce.

37:31.035 --> 37:32.827
Hey, wait, hold up. Well give you a ride.

37:33.204 --> 37:34.662
Yo' let me do it this time.

37:34.872 --> 37:36.581
Skinny, you the look out.

37:36.790 --> 37:38.374
Well why can't I do it this time?

37:38.959 --> 37:39.959
Can you do it?

37:40.127 --> 37:41.085
Yeah!

37:42.630 --> 37:44.005
Let him do it then.

37:44.215 --> 37:47.967
You know what, here you go tough guy.

37:49.011 --> 37:51.221
You see that car right there? Go get 'em.

37:57.269 --> 37:59.270
That car's got an alarm on it.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.605
I know. I know.

38:20.584 --> 38:22.752
I told you that alarm was going to go off.

38:23.254 --> 38:25.296
Wait a minute, you all set me up!

38:28.259 --> 38:29.926
Hang on. I got us one.

38:30.135 --> 38:31.678
You should have saw your face.

39:13.470 --> 39:15.597
That was good. Play it back, Miles?

39:15.764 --> 39:16.681
I like that.

39:18.601 --> 39:19.476
Nora.

39:20.019 --> 39:23.355
Yo... look who's here.
Sorry bro', closed studio.

39:23.731 --> 39:24.981
Okay bro'.

39:25.608 --> 39:26.441
You're an hour late.

39:26.609 --> 39:28.735
Yeah, my bad. I got caught up.

39:29.529 --> 39:30.487
For an hour?

39:30.863 --> 39:34.199
Yeah, I had some things I had to do. Look,
I'm sorry. Can't we just rehearse now?

39:34.367 --> 39:36.618
No, there's other dancers
in the studio now.

39:36.828 --> 39:37.577
We can't.

39:37.787 --> 39:39.996
Why you getting all mad at me,
I'm here every single day.

39:40.665 --> 39:41.498
Look, I said I'm sorry.

39:41.707 --> 39:43.416
Yeah well, sorry's not going to cut it.

39:43.584 --> 39:44.793
Yeah... we're working here man.

39:45.128 --> 39:46.670
Some of us take this seriously.

40:28.296 --> 40:29.379
Where were you!

40:30.631 --> 40:31.756
Where was I when?

40:32.008 --> 40:33.800
When we were supposed to be rehearsing?

40:34.635 --> 40:38.471
Oh yeah, I don't think that whole rehearsing
thing is going to work out for me.

40:38.639 --> 40:40.056
What the Hell does that mean!

40:40.933 --> 40:42.225
That means I'm out.

40:42.602 --> 40:43.727
What?

40:43.895 --> 40:47.439
Are you kidding me. You're going to quit
without even talking to me about it?

40:47.857 --> 40:52.402
Yeah, I'm sorry. Look, I
got to get back to work.

40:52.653 --> 40:55.155
I can't believe this!
I can't believe I trusted you!

40:55.406 --> 40:56.781
That was so stupid!

40:56.991 --> 40:59.034
People make stupid decisions everyday.

41:00.203 --> 41:02.412
Besides, it didn't look
like you needed me anyway.

41:19.847 --> 41:21.014
Mac you better get your feet off the table.

41:21.224 --> 41:22.265
Hey shut up. I ain't gonna move my feet.

41:22.475 --> 41:24.434
Marcus, get your feet off my table.

41:24.894 --> 41:25.977
I told ya' boy.

41:26.729 --> 41:27.646
Mom!

41:27.855 --> 41:28.772
Don't you leave this house.

41:28.981 --> 41:30.982
I don't want to hear about any of you
getting into any trouble.

41:32.276 --> 41:33.235
We ain't goin' nowhere mom.

41:33.402 --> 41:37.447
That's right, I'll be back home
in time to make y'all breakfast.

41:38.491 --> 41:39.199
Bye mommy.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.158
Bye Mrs. Carter.

41:43.329 --> 41:44.287
Ow man!

41:50.044 --> 41:51.962
Look, look... Weak crossover.

41:53.798 --> 41:55.674
Hey, you think you're
as good as these guys.

41:56.092 --> 41:57.133
Please...

41:57.677 --> 41:58.802
Why don't you try out?

41:59.470 --> 42:02.347
For the And 1 team?
Why would I need to do that for?

42:03.599 --> 42:05.976
I don't know. I always thought you
should've played for the school team.

42:06.143 --> 42:06.977
The school team?

42:07.186 --> 42:09.479
Yeah, right. They suck.

42:09.814 --> 42:11.147
Maybe they wouldn't suck if you played.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.358
Man, what is this, part of your
community service or something?

42:13.567 --> 42:15.986
What ya' gonna say next?
This is your brain on drugs?

42:15.987 --> 42:17.612
Man, the Hell with that?

42:20.616 --> 42:21.366
I'm just sayin'...

42:21.534 --> 42:24.160
All right man, just drop it.

42:25.538 --> 42:27.372
I don't see you out trying to do nothin'.

42:27.540 --> 42:30.083
You quit everything you start.
And you know it.

42:34.672 --> 42:36.840
That's me right there...

42:46.767 --> 42:47.851
Nora?

42:49.895 --> 42:51.771
Where have you been? It's getting late.

42:53.065 --> 42:54.524
Where do you think, mom?

42:54.734 --> 42:57.569
You've been rehearsing a lot lately.
What about your other school work?

42:57.695 --> 43:00.071
Rehearsing is the most important part
of my school work.

43:00.281 --> 43:01.990
It's kind of the whole point.

43:02.199 --> 43:05.160
Sweetie, I just don't think that dancing...

43:05.369 --> 43:06.411
Dancing is what, mom?

43:06.579 --> 43:10.040
What do you know about it anyway?
When was the last time you saw me dance?

43:10.583 --> 43:11.708
That's not fair.

43:13.210 --> 43:16.087
Well you know what, you don't have
to worry about it anymore.

43:16.255 --> 43:19.257
Because the guy I've been rehearsing
with for the showcase he quit today.

43:19.425 --> 43:21.468
So basically, I'm screwed.

43:23.721 --> 43:25.680
You might get your dream after all.

43:32.814 --> 43:33.605
Nora.

43:35.316 --> 43:36.400
Wait a minute.

43:36.734 --> 43:38.986
Will you hold on a second. Look, I just...

43:39.195 --> 43:41.613
wanted to say I'm sorry about yesterday.

43:42.156 --> 43:44.074
What's the matter?
Don't feel like mopping any floors today?

43:44.284 --> 43:46.034
Look, can you just give me a break.

43:48.121 --> 43:50.581
Do you have any idea
how important this showcase is?

43:50.748 --> 43:52.040
Who is going to be there?

43:52.542 --> 43:54.334
I don't know. People?

43:54.544 --> 43:55.586
People?

43:56.087 --> 43:59.756
Important people, from every major
dance company in the country.

43:59.966 --> 44:03.468
Without this showcase,
I have nothing. I go nowhere!

44:03.636 --> 44:08.432
Okay. All right, I get it. I know all about
having nothing. It sucks.

44:08.641 --> 44:09.391
Yes it does.

44:09.601 --> 44:11.143
So are we going to go back to doing this?

44:11.352 --> 44:12.811
- No.
- No?

44:13.021 --> 44:13.979
I don't trust you.

44:14.272 --> 44:16.273
Then what do I got to do to prove it you?

44:17.775 --> 44:19.318
Look, I'll do anything.

44:21.779 --> 44:22.946
Anything?

44:24.574 --> 44:29.328
Up and... grand pile all
the way to the ground.

44:29.537 --> 44:33.248
Back up, and reach your arm up high...

44:33.458 --> 44:35.876
touch the sky, down to the floor...

44:36.085 --> 44:40.422
touch your toes. And back up.

44:43.968 --> 44:50.015
And point and second. And pile...

44:50.266 --> 44:54.186
good. Pile, and... up.

44:54.812 --> 44:57.022
I thought she was going
to slap me in my face.

44:57.982 --> 44:59.066
This is me.

45:00.151 --> 45:02.903
Okay, why are you teaching ballet class?

45:03.488 --> 45:04.821
Doesn't look like you need a job.

45:05.073 --> 45:07.824
Oh you know, just puts off
coming home a little longer.

45:08.117 --> 45:09.868
Oh, it couldn't be that bad.

45:12.038 --> 45:14.498
My mom doesn't really
get the whole dancing thing.

45:14.624 --> 45:15.666
What about your Dad?

45:15.833 --> 45:17.417
He died a couple of years ago.

45:18.711 --> 45:19.586
Sorry.

45:19.796 --> 45:21.046
No... it's okay.

45:22.590 --> 45:24.716
He was the one who always
encouraged me, you know?

45:24.926 --> 45:27.844
I'd meet him a rehearsals.
Watching all my routines.

45:28.680 --> 45:30.305
Sounds like a cool dude.

45:31.766 --> 45:33.308
Thanks for walking me home.

45:34.852 --> 45:35.686
Later.

45:35.853 --> 45:36.728
Bye.

45:39.273 --> 45:41.149
Hey look, look. There's a game
tomorrow at the courts.

45:41.317 --> 45:43.068
Those cats want a rematch with us.
You down?

45:43.277 --> 45:46.697
I can't make that. I got community
service every day this week, man.

45:49.993 --> 45:52.160
Hey, put that away, what are you doin'?

45:53.204 --> 45:54.329
What's up between you and Lucy.

45:54.539 --> 45:55.831
Looks like she's kinda feelin' you.

45:56.916 --> 45:58.125
I don't know about that.

45:58.626 --> 45:59.543
What, you scared?

45:59.711 --> 46:01.628
Okay, this Colin is too old for you.

46:02.422 --> 46:03.088
He's so...

46:03.256 --> 46:03.880
Cheesy?

46:04.340 --> 46:07.009
Romantic. Okay? He's romantic.

46:08.219 --> 46:09.845
Why isn't Nora using this?

46:10.430 --> 46:13.432
Man, Nora's old school.
I ain't talkin' Sugar hill Gang...

46:13.599 --> 46:16.768
I'm talking Vivaldi old school. For real...

46:17.145 --> 46:18.729
I think you should let her listen to it.

46:18.938 --> 46:19.771
Hey Nora...

46:19.981 --> 46:21.231
Come here for a second,
I want you to hear something.

46:21.441 --> 46:22.274
Don't start.

46:22.900 --> 46:25.235
I'm just saying, you guys get along well...

46:25.486 --> 46:26.611
He's my partner.

46:27.447 --> 46:28.697
He's just your partner.

46:29.240 --> 46:30.365
And too many things.

46:32.035 --> 46:33.994
Miles got a... what's that? Violin?

46:34.203 --> 46:34.703
Violin.

46:34.912 --> 46:36.580
Some kids to play violin on the track.

46:36.748 --> 46:39.416
Finally working with people
that can actually play instruments?

46:39.584 --> 46:43.253
Hey, I can play all right.
I just prefer to play with myself.

46:43.755 --> 46:44.755
What?

46:46.090 --> 46:47.007
He makes it too easy.

46:47.216 --> 46:49.009
No, not play with...

46:49.260 --> 46:50.135
Just listen.

46:59.353 --> 47:05.108
I like it. I really like it. That's good.

47:05.318 --> 47:06.193
I told you dawg.

47:06.402 --> 47:07.736
Hey, I was thinking...

47:09.155 --> 47:11.406
You know that... You know that turn,
where we got the leg behind us?

47:11.574 --> 47:12.115
Yeah?

47:12.325 --> 47:15.702
What if... what if I went down and...

47:16.704 --> 47:19.122
we like change levels. I don't know...

47:19.373 --> 47:21.249
I don't mean to be out of line.

47:21.459 --> 47:22.125
It's cool...

47:23.461 --> 47:25.170
I like it, let's try it.

47:26.380 --> 47:28.215
5, 6, 7, 8...

47:28.424 --> 47:30.967
1, 2, 3, 4...

47:32.678 --> 47:34.179
That's actually really good.

47:34.639 --> 47:35.305
Cool.

47:35.473 --> 47:37.849
Maybe we should do it. Let's try it again.

47:38.059 --> 47:40.143
5, 6, 7, 8...

47:44.190 --> 47:46.817
All right then,
I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.

47:46.984 --> 47:47.818
Okay.

47:51.030 --> 47:52.197
You need a ride?

47:53.950 --> 47:57.327
Umm, have you ever been out to Hampden?

47:57.995 --> 48:00.288
No, but there's a place I go near there.

48:07.755 --> 48:10.298
I'm serious, where are you taking me?

48:10.508 --> 48:12.300
Hold on, I'm about to show you.

48:13.010 --> 48:15.762
Is this... is this where you kill me?

48:16.013 --> 48:16.930
Funny...

48:24.063 --> 48:25.063
This is it.

48:33.656 --> 48:37.701
I got a view just like
this, from my balcony.

48:38.536 --> 48:39.619
You do?

48:40.705 --> 48:43.415
No. How did you find this place?

48:43.708 --> 48:45.667
I've been coming here since I was a kid.

48:47.295 --> 48:50.380
My dad was an executive
at one of the shipping companies.

48:52.300 --> 48:54.426
This is where I imagined my whole routine.

48:54.635 --> 48:55.677
I don't know how you do it.

48:57.054 --> 49:00.682
Don't you think about
how two people are going to move.

49:01.726 --> 49:05.353
I don't know, every detail.
I couldn't do that.

49:05.855 --> 49:07.314
Well you've been doing it.

49:07.857 --> 49:09.316
It's not the same thing though.

49:09.483 --> 49:10.859
Well that's how it starts.

49:12.737 --> 49:14.529
You know I always saw this routine...

49:14.739 --> 49:16.072
with a bunch of other dancers.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.199
What do you mean?

49:17.700 --> 49:20.327
Well, if I had enough dancers.

49:20.494 --> 49:24.915
I could have them all starting in unison.
And then slowly breaking out in a canon.

49:25.041 --> 49:27.417
Whoa... What's a canon?

49:28.044 --> 49:30.378
You know, like row your boat?

49:31.797 --> 49:37.302
Okay. I'll show you.
You know that phase with the turn and lift.

49:37.470 --> 49:39.304
They all have turn and lifts.

49:41.515 --> 49:45.060
All right, what, in the middle section?
Yeah, I know it.

49:45.269 --> 49:48.730
Okay. Well, instead of doing it together.
You're going to go first.

49:50.066 --> 49:51.775
- Come on.
- All right.

49:53.527 --> 49:54.527
We go on 1.

49:55.112 --> 49:57.405
5, 6, 7, 8...

50:43.494 --> 50:47.998
I think... look... You started with
a bunch of dancers...

50:48.165 --> 50:49.833
You should do it with a bunch of dancers.

50:50.376 --> 50:52.627
Okay, and where would I find these dancers?

50:52.837 --> 50:56.172
You do go to a school
that's just busting with kids in tights.

50:56.299 --> 50:57.007
Why don't you take your pick.

50:57.174 --> 50:59.384
The only ones left are sophomores and freshmen.
There's no way...

50:59.552 --> 51:00.927
any of them are good enough.

51:01.387 --> 51:05.849
How do you know if they're good enough or not?
You didn't know I was good enough.

51:07.518 --> 51:08.893
Well, who says you are.

51:25.411 --> 51:26.661
Yo', let's go man.

51:26.871 --> 51:28.288
No, man, I'm late for my hours.

51:29.081 --> 51:30.081
What about our game.

51:30.291 --> 51:31.583
Yo' I'm going to have to do it tomorrow.

51:31.792 --> 51:33.043
You said that yesterday.

51:34.295 --> 51:36.046
I'll catch you all later.

51:37.798 --> 51:39.132
Now I'm gettin' pissed.

51:46.599 --> 51:48.183
How many did you say you needed?

52:13.376 --> 52:14.251
Thanks Miles.

52:17.505 --> 52:20.549
So umm... that's basically
what we have so far.

52:21.217 --> 52:25.929
Congratulations.
You've really expanded your range.

52:26.598 --> 52:28.932
I thought your original piece was good.

52:29.392 --> 52:30.642
But this...

52:31.769 --> 52:33.770
This is very risky, Nora.

52:34.772 --> 52:36.440
But it may pay off.

52:36.733 --> 52:38.734
What made you decide to change your piece.

52:38.985 --> 52:41.111
Actually a lot of this is Tyler.

52:41.362 --> 52:43.113
Naw, that's all you.

52:43.281 --> 52:47.117
Okay fine, he gave me some of his moves
and I gave him ballet lessons.

52:47.285 --> 52:48.660
You studied ballet?

52:49.787 --> 52:52.497
He's actually pretty good.
He could be a student here.

52:53.583 --> 52:55.876
Unfortunately our school
year has already begun.

52:56.002 --> 52:57.711
But, keep up the good work.

53:06.179 --> 53:07.972
Miles? Miles!

53:08.181 --> 53:09.140
Not right now, all right.

53:09.307 --> 53:11.058
What's wrong? Miles?

53:11.184 --> 53:14.728
Miles! What's wrong? I
just heard you guys got signed.

53:14.938 --> 53:15.771
You heard wrong.

53:15.981 --> 53:17.523
Everybody saying Brett got signed...

53:17.691 --> 53:20.151
Brett got signed. He signed without me.

53:20.318 --> 53:21.444
How did he get signed without you?

53:21.611 --> 53:24.280
Well according to him,
the Label thought he was the only talent.

53:24.406 --> 53:27.700
So they want to put him out as a solo artist
and get him to work with other producers.

53:27.993 --> 53:28.909
Oh my God.

53:29.077 --> 53:29.660
And you know what...

53:29.828 --> 53:31.078
I knew Brett had an ego.

53:31.246 --> 53:35.249
I knew he did. But damn I thought
he'd sit me down and tell me like a man.

53:43.633 --> 53:44.508
I knew it.

53:51.266 --> 53:51.849
Hey baby.

53:52.017 --> 53:53.350
Is that why you flew to New York last week?

53:53.518 --> 53:55.478
Whoa. Whoa Nora, calm down.

53:55.687 --> 53:56.896
You ditched Miles.

53:57.105 --> 53:59.899
After all the work you did together
you dump him just like that.

54:00.108 --> 54:00.983
Come here...

54:01.776 --> 54:04.236
Not just like that, all right. You
haven't even heard my side of the story.

54:04.404 --> 54:06.363
Right. 'Cause you don't
even have time to call your girlfriend...

54:06.573 --> 54:08.699
and tell her the news.
I have to find out through everyone else.

54:08.992 --> 54:11.285
Nora, come on. I'm sorry.

54:11.703 --> 54:14.872
I didn't expect it to happen like this.
It's just happening.

54:15.165 --> 54:16.499
All right, like we always talked about.

54:16.666 --> 54:19.710
No, we never talked about
stepping on our friends to get there.

54:19.961 --> 54:22.671
When someone hands you your dream,
you take it, you don't ask questions.

54:22.881 --> 54:23.714
I would.

54:23.882 --> 54:26.884
You think you would. But you don't know
until it's right in front of you.

54:27.427 --> 54:29.345
Seriously Nora, would you have walked away.

54:31.473 --> 54:35.351
I don't know, but I'm walking away now.

54:36.353 --> 54:37.394
What, you're breaking up with me?

54:37.604 --> 54:38.479
Yes!

54:38.730 --> 54:42.149
This is about me, or Miles or any of that.
It's about Tyler, isn't it?

54:42.734 --> 54:44.818
No, it's about me, Brett.

54:46.112 --> 54:50.074
Fine. Just remember that loser is
headed nowhere fast, and you know it.

55:01.711 --> 55:03.963
Mrs. Gordon? Director Gordon?

55:04.214 --> 55:05.631
Can I help you Tyler?

55:07.926 --> 55:10.928
There's somethin', I kinda wanted to...

55:14.432 --> 55:15.724
It's probably stupid...

55:15.934 --> 55:17.142
Then perhaps it can wait.

55:17.811 --> 55:20.104
Okay, you know how me
and Nora been working together.

55:20.313 --> 55:21.230
Yes.

55:21.439 --> 55:24.692
It's been kind of making me think lately...

55:25.402 --> 55:27.236
That maybe I'd like to come here.

55:28.947 --> 55:30.531
You want to apply to the school?

55:30.949 --> 55:33.450
Yeah, kids transfer don't they?

55:33.660 --> 55:35.202
I was kind of hoping, maybe...

55:35.620 --> 55:38.163
I don't know, maybe finish out
my school year, here.

55:41.543 --> 55:44.128
It's not that you don't have talent Tyler.

55:45.171 --> 55:48.549
But a lot of kids have talent,
take so much more than that.

55:48.758 --> 55:49.967
This is a grueling program.

55:50.176 --> 55:53.137
My students work themselves
into the ground, everyday...

55:53.346 --> 55:56.181
just to get even a fraction
closer to their goals.

55:56.349 --> 55:58.183
And we're tough as Hell on them in here,

55:58.268 --> 56:01.145
because we know
what they're going to face out there.

56:01.563 --> 56:04.523
The only kids that make
it are the one prepared to fight for it.

56:04.691 --> 56:06.233
Yeah, I understand that.

56:06.443 --> 56:10.571
I'm not sure that you do.
Not for something real.

56:11.239 --> 56:13.991
I've already seen you give up once already.

56:14.451 --> 56:15.951
That's not going to happen again.

56:16.161 --> 56:18.662
Saying the words, doesn't make it so.

56:18.830 --> 56:20.539
Okay, then tell me what I got to do.

56:20.749 --> 56:23.167
I can't. You have to show me.

56:24.127 --> 56:25.794
Show me that you want it.

56:26.004 --> 56:29.548
Really want it. You do that...

56:30.759 --> 56:32.176
and we can talk.

56:34.971 --> 56:37.681
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 3:00.

57:03.833 --> 57:05.501
Hey, come on, man. Would
you snap out of it.

57:06.795 --> 57:09.755
All right, the way I look at it,
Brett did you a favor.

57:10.548 --> 57:13.008
Yo', your beats are hotter then
what he can do with them anyway.

57:29.943 --> 57:30.526
Come on man...

57:30.735 --> 57:32.986
I got to sit up here and watch this Colin.

57:33.905 --> 57:37.950
Sorry, did we come here for him?
I thought we came here for Lucy.

57:38.243 --> 57:40.077
Is that who you been looking
at this whole time?

57:40.245 --> 57:42.371
He is kind of hot, I guess.
In a weird way... if you like that.

57:42.580 --> 57:44.039
Shut up. Shut up.

58:04.811 --> 58:06.812
Thank you, we're going
to take a break and be back in five.

58:12.819 --> 58:14.319
I got to get up outta here man.

58:14.738 --> 58:15.946
Hey guys...

58:16.156 --> 58:17.781
You umm... met my boyfriend.

58:17.949 --> 58:19.199
Hey man. I'm Colin.

58:19.451 --> 58:22.619
Tyler. Nice to meet you man. This is Miles.

58:22.871 --> 58:23.620
What's up man?

58:23.830 --> 58:25.956
Miles? Hey this is the guy
you were telling me about?

58:28.042 --> 58:29.376
Yeah, she said you played man...

58:29.586 --> 58:30.627
I got a set up if you want to join us.

58:30.837 --> 58:34.047
I left my G4 at home, man.

58:34.799 --> 58:35.799
It's in his bag...

58:35.925 --> 58:36.675
Yeah?

58:37.844 --> 58:39.845
Come on man, we'll set up. Ready Luce?

58:41.014 --> 58:44.475
Dude thinks he's slick. Coming at me
with that reverse psychology shit.

58:44.642 --> 58:46.143
He seems kind of cool to me, man.

58:46.352 --> 58:47.603
That's part of his whole game.

58:47.854 --> 58:48.771
Why don't you just go play.

59:01.409 --> 59:02.284
Hey.

59:02.786 --> 59:04.995
Hey, I didn't think you were going to come,

59:05.163 --> 59:06.079
after everything that happened...

59:06.331 --> 59:07.998
That's exactly whey I wanted to come.

59:08.500 --> 59:09.875
What are you doing here?

59:10.043 --> 59:11.502
Miles needed a wing man.

59:14.005 --> 59:15.380
What's he doing up there?

59:16.716 --> 59:18.675
Trying to be the bigger man.

59:20.470 --> 59:21.345
Okay...

59:22.514 --> 59:23.764
You look beautiful.

59:24.182 --> 59:24.848
Thank you.

59:25.016 --> 59:26.850
Everybody ready, let's do this!

59:40.240 --> 59:41.740
I didn't know she could sing like that!

59:41.991 --> 59:45.244
In her words she majors in dance,
'cause she already knows how to sing.

59:50.416 --> 59:51.375
Kill her Miles.

59:55.547 --> 59:56.922
So you gonna ask me to dance?

59:58.383 --> 01:00:00.217
I didn't know you could
dance without your tights.

01:00:03.221 --> 01:00:04.805
You don't know what you've
gotten yourself into.

01:00:18.403 --> 01:00:19.236
What is that...

01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:29.913
Come on!

01:00:46.306 --> 01:00:47.431
All my ladies!

01:00:48.182 --> 01:00:49.516
Move it to the front...

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:51.768
Show 'em what ya' got!

01:01:07.243 --> 01:01:07.910
Fellas...

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.146
Everybody dance!

01:01:36.731 --> 01:01:43.070
Everybody dance! Come dance with me!

01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:59.312
I swear I have never seen that
many people here before!

01:02:59.522 --> 01:03:00.731
Get used to it.

01:03:04.694 --> 01:03:06.820
Come on you guys,
let's take a walk by the water.

01:03:07.655 --> 01:03:08.739
Come on, let's walk.

01:03:08.906 --> 01:03:11.033
Let them go. Let them go.

01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:20.292
You're going to make me say it, aren't you?

01:03:20.501 --> 01:03:21.710
Make you say what?

01:03:24.047 --> 01:03:26.214
I know I've been hatin' Colin.

01:03:27.341 --> 01:03:29.301
But he was good.

01:03:29.635 --> 01:03:36.183
He was real good.
Some one who's so sophisticated.

01:03:36.476 --> 01:03:41.438
You always get off lightly.
You know, you were umm...

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:47.444
pretty good yourself Miles...
Just a little bit...

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.197
I try to do...

01:03:54.702 --> 01:03:55.744
What?

01:04:03.878 --> 01:04:09.424
Umm... Umm... Don't worry about it.

01:04:10.551 --> 01:04:10.926
Lucy...

01:04:11.135 --> 01:04:14.971
I got to go. I'm gonna
go check our sound vels.

01:04:20.812 --> 01:04:24.523
That place is... That place is crazy.
Is it always like that?

01:04:24.732 --> 01:04:25.816
Yes.

01:04:26.484 --> 01:04:30.362
But tonight, Miles and Lucy
were on a whole other level.

01:04:32.281 --> 01:04:33.824
You weren't so bad yourself.

01:04:34.492 --> 01:04:36.993
You all know exactly what you want.

01:04:37.662 --> 01:04:39.746
Well what about you, what do you want?

01:04:41.332 --> 01:04:43.375
I don't know, nothing...

01:04:43.918 --> 01:04:48.046
Come on. What about when you were a kid.
All kids want something.

01:04:50.049 --> 01:04:52.759
For me, it's just...

01:04:53.219 --> 01:04:55.011
it's better not to want anything.

01:04:56.264 --> 01:05:00.517
That way if it goes away or doesn't happen.

01:05:02.019 --> 01:05:04.146
You know, it doesn't matter.

01:05:06.232 --> 01:05:08.525
But you want something now, right?

01:05:09.944 --> 01:05:13.196
Like maybe to go to MSA.

01:05:15.366 --> 01:05:20.787
There's a lot of things that I want now,
that I didn't use to.

01:05:21.247 --> 01:05:24.416
I even catch myself,
every once and awhile...

01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:26.084
actually thinking I could have them.

01:05:53.779 --> 01:05:55.780
Please don't kick me out
I brought you orange juice.

01:05:56.991 --> 01:05:58.950
Bill and Lena went out,
you're baby sitting.

01:05:59.744 --> 01:06:00.744
Thank you.

01:06:02.038 --> 01:06:03.914
Why are you always so tired lately?

01:06:04.415 --> 01:06:05.916
Because I've been working a lot.

01:06:06.167 --> 01:06:07.250
Doing what?

01:06:08.252 --> 01:06:09.794
Why do you ask so many questions?

01:06:10.004 --> 01:06:10.670
Just...

01:06:10.671 --> 01:06:11.963
No, no, never mind. Don't answer that.

01:06:12.173 --> 01:06:13.590
Just go get Malcolm's shoes on.

01:06:13.799 --> 01:06:14.674
All right.

01:06:15.968 --> 01:06:17.052
Throw it!

01:06:19.513 --> 01:06:20.764
You got it, you almost got it.

01:06:20.932 --> 01:06:23.892
Dancing. You can't dance.

01:06:24.018 --> 01:06:24.809
You can't dance...

01:06:25.102 --> 01:06:26.519
You've never seen me dance.

01:06:27.438 --> 01:06:28.939
Then, do something.

01:06:29.148 --> 01:06:30.899
Do somethin'?

01:06:37.198 --> 01:06:39.115
Okay it was fine, it was okay.

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.870
What was that?

01:06:44.622 --> 01:06:45.413
- What was that?
- It was nothing.

01:06:45.623 --> 01:06:46.498
Where did you learn that from?

01:06:46.707 --> 01:06:48.708
I'm not throwing anything
until you show me what that was.

01:06:52.755 --> 01:06:54.798
All right. All right.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.802
All right...

01:06:59.095 --> 01:07:00.595
If you can do that, you can do this.

01:07:07.979 --> 01:07:08.728
I love it.

01:07:08.896 --> 01:07:13.066
You got that... Hit... Hit...

01:07:15.653 --> 01:07:16.987
Okay, let's try it.

01:07:17.154 --> 01:07:18.071
So you got the whole thing?

01:07:18.197 --> 01:07:18.822
Yeah.

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:22.492
Okay. All right. On go. Go.

01:07:23.202 --> 01:07:25.578
1, 2, 3, go.

01:07:27.331 --> 01:07:28.373
What...

01:07:33.671 --> 01:07:35.797
Running man? You don't
know nothing about that.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.134
Malcolm, can you do the Running Man?

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:40.468
Yeah!

01:07:40.678 --> 01:07:42.012
Oh yeah!

01:07:42.638 --> 01:07:44.139
Here we go!

01:08:09.707 --> 01:08:10.832
No! No! No!

01:09:12.937 --> 01:09:13.937
This is you?

01:09:14.606 --> 01:09:16.773
Don't be mean, I was a chubby kid.

01:09:19.944 --> 01:09:20.652
What are you saying?

01:09:20.862 --> 01:09:22.779
That if I was like that right now,
you wouldn't like me?

01:09:23.031 --> 01:09:26.116
Oh no, I could deal with the chubbiness.

01:09:26.283 --> 01:09:29.620
Just if you were missing those two front
teeth, I don't know if I could work with that.

01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:34.457
Thank you very much. You
know I was thinking...

01:09:35.167 --> 01:09:36.417
We should talk to Director Gordon...

01:09:36.627 --> 01:09:40.212
about using the showcase
as your audition to get into the school.

01:09:43.009 --> 01:09:46.094
I don't know, do you
think she'd go for that.

01:09:46.304 --> 01:09:48.388
It's about going after
what you want, right?

01:09:59.692 --> 01:10:00.609
Mom!

01:10:00.818 --> 01:10:04.279
Umm... Hey... I didn't know
you were home already.

01:10:04.739 --> 01:10:06.073
This is Tyler.

01:10:06.783 --> 01:10:08.241
My rehearsal partner.

01:10:08.451 --> 01:10:12.329
Nice to meet you Mrs. Clark.
You have a beautiful home here.

01:10:12.497 --> 01:10:15.499
Thank you, we certainly like it.

01:10:17.835 --> 01:10:20.754
I should probably get... get going anyway.

01:10:20.922 --> 01:10:22.547
Thanks for showing me those pictures.

01:10:24.008 --> 01:10:25.175
It was nice to meet you.

01:10:39.148 --> 01:10:43.110
All right, here we go. Ready, 1, 2, 3, go!

01:10:43.569 --> 01:10:45.320
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:45.989 --> 01:10:46.947
What's up?

01:10:47.365 --> 01:10:52.536
Umm, look about the other night.
You didn't tell anybody, did you?

01:10:52.745 --> 01:10:53.620
Naw...

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:59.543
Because it's just musicians, whatever.

01:11:00.712 --> 01:11:02.629
You ain't got nothin' to explain to me.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.549
Whoa, what's wrong, why, why are you
talking to me like that.

01:11:06.884 --> 01:11:10.470
You want to be with someone who doesn't
appreciate what a good thing he's got.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.180
That's a hundred percent your business.

01:11:14.559 --> 01:11:17.728
I just thought your were smart enough
to know you deserve better.

01:11:22.358 --> 01:11:23.275
Excuse me.

01:11:34.162 --> 01:11:35.787
All right, let's move it
out even more than that.

01:11:35.997 --> 01:11:38.915
I want it to look pretty... All right. Go.

01:11:40.126 --> 01:11:41.418
Wait, hold up, hold up.

01:11:42.003 --> 01:11:43.754
Tell me I'm not seeing this Ty'.

01:11:46.257 --> 01:11:47.257
Mac...

01:11:49.719 --> 01:11:52.679
Hold on Mac. Yo' wait up a second.

01:11:54.474 --> 01:11:55.640
What you doin' man?

01:11:56.017 --> 01:11:58.268
What was that, Riverdancin'?

01:11:58.895 --> 01:12:00.353
You gettin' down with your Irish roots now?

01:12:00.521 --> 01:12:00.937
It's not like that...

01:12:01.147 --> 01:12:02.147
It's not like what?

01:12:02.398 --> 01:12:03.857
It's part of my community service, man!

01:12:04.108 --> 01:12:04.941
Dancin'?

01:12:05.151 --> 01:12:07.360
How is dancin' a part
of your community service, Ty'?

01:12:08.821 --> 01:12:09.613
It's complicated.

01:12:09.822 --> 01:12:11.782
Well explain it to me brother,
'cause I ain't that stupid.

01:12:11.949 --> 01:12:12.616
Fine...

01:12:12.784 --> 01:12:15.160
Look, you were supposed
to meet me at the courts two hours ago.

01:12:15.453 --> 01:12:17.621
Then I come over here
and I see you blowing me off for this?

01:12:18.414 --> 01:12:19.498
This?

01:12:19.791 --> 01:12:21.792
We ain't been hangin'.
You ain't been callin'.

01:12:21.959 --> 01:12:24.127
Why? 'Cause you leapin' around here
with a bunch of rich kids!

01:12:24.295 --> 01:12:26.630
They're not all rich in there,
it ain't like that, man.

01:12:27.882 --> 01:12:29.007
All right, Mac, hold on.

01:12:29.217 --> 01:12:31.176
There's this girl. Look she asked me to...

01:12:31.344 --> 01:12:33.303
rehearse with her for the showcase thing.

01:12:33.846 --> 01:12:34.971
That's all.

01:12:41.479 --> 01:12:44.564
So you messed around
with our friendship for a girl.

01:12:45.608 --> 01:12:46.983
So it's like that.

01:12:49.529 --> 01:12:50.946
That's a relief, Ty'.

01:12:51.197 --> 01:12:52.280
Come on, man.

01:13:10.133 --> 01:13:14.344
Wow. That was quick.

01:13:18.266 --> 01:13:19.391
That's great.

01:13:19.517 --> 01:13:20.517
Hey Tyler.

01:13:20.977 --> 01:13:21.852
Hey.

01:13:22.353 --> 01:13:23.520
What are you... are you back?

01:13:23.688 --> 01:13:27.274
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Thanks for filling in for me man.

01:13:28.901 --> 01:13:30.110
Can you give us a sec'.

01:13:30.278 --> 01:13:31.194
Sure.

01:13:41.831 --> 01:13:43.039
- Hey guys.
- Hey. Good?

01:13:43.249 --> 01:13:44.249
Yeah. Definitely.

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:52.424
I didn't think he was coming back,
he hasn't even been here.

01:13:54.886 --> 01:13:56.553
I don't know what to do.

01:13:57.054 --> 01:14:01.933
So, he's back. Where does that leave me?

01:14:03.728 --> 01:14:05.103
You don't have to say anything.

01:14:05.271 --> 01:14:07.063
Wait, what does that mean?

01:14:08.524 --> 01:14:10.859
I can't believe I bought
into all this bullshit.

01:14:11.402 --> 01:14:13.695
You're really just going
to turn your back on me?

01:14:14.071 --> 01:14:15.906
That's not what I'm doing, Tyler.

01:14:16.073 --> 01:14:18.200
Andrew is a student here, he's a senior...

01:14:18.409 --> 01:14:19.618
You're just like Brett...

01:14:19.869 --> 01:14:21.870
- You just use people and then you dump them.
- What?

01:14:22.079 --> 01:14:23.580
Why are you making it sound like that...

01:14:23.789 --> 01:14:25.916
is not even the same situation.
And you know it!

01:14:26.125 --> 01:14:29.794
How is it not?
Have I just been filling in for Andrew?

01:14:30.922 --> 01:14:31.963
That's not fair.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.383
I'm out.

01:14:36.594 --> 01:14:37.802
Tyler!

01:14:38.054 --> 01:14:40.847
Tyler wait, give me a
second to figure this out.

01:15:24.809 --> 01:15:27.018
Yo', what's up Ty'. Yo' man!

01:15:47.665 --> 01:15:48.332
Hello?

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.793
Hi. Ahh, is Tyler there?

01:15:51.085 --> 01:15:52.002
May I ask who's calling?

01:15:52.378 --> 01:15:53.420
It's Nora.

01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:55.839
Nora?

01:15:59.219 --> 01:16:01.595
No, he's not here.

01:16:02.472 --> 01:16:04.681
Yeah, umm... just tell him I called.

01:16:05.016 --> 01:16:05.849
Okay.

01:16:41.845 --> 01:16:43.720
5, 6, 7, 8...

01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:45.973
1 and 2! 3, 4!

01:16:47.767 --> 01:16:49.226
Andrew, are you all right?

01:16:51.145 --> 01:16:54.022
Okay, try walking on it.

01:16:57.694 --> 01:16:59.069
I can't do this Nora.

01:17:00.071 --> 01:17:01.071
What?

01:17:01.281 --> 01:17:04.032
You and I both know I can't
pull this routine off.

01:17:14.961 --> 01:17:15.961
Here mom.

01:17:17.589 --> 01:17:18.630
Nora...

01:17:24.846 --> 01:17:25.762
I bet you can't make the shot.

01:17:25.972 --> 01:17:26.847
Bet you I can.

01:17:27.056 --> 01:17:27.806
Whatever man.

01:17:28.016 --> 01:17:28.932
Right, whatever.

01:17:29.142 --> 01:17:30.100
Now let me do it.

01:17:31.603 --> 01:17:32.728
You suck man.

01:17:36.608 --> 01:17:37.566
Hey yo' Ty!

01:17:39.986 --> 01:17:40.777
What's up?

01:17:40.987 --> 01:17:41.862
Where you been man?

01:17:42.238 --> 01:17:43.906
Nothin', around.

01:17:45.658 --> 01:17:49.286
Yo' man, just give me my ball back. Ain't
you gonna be late for ballerina class.

01:17:49.412 --> 01:17:51.455
No, man. I'm through with that.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.290
So what happened with that girl?

01:17:54.751 --> 01:17:55.626
Nothin'.

01:17:56.210 --> 01:17:58.462
Nothin'? I'm supposed to just believe you?

01:17:58.713 --> 01:17:59.838
Yeah, man.

01:18:00.006 --> 01:18:01.131
You are.

01:18:02.842 --> 01:18:05.052
I don't know. Man turned
his back on his boy...

01:18:05.303 --> 01:18:08.847
Deserves a second chance. All right?

01:18:10.475 --> 01:18:11.558
Come on man.

01:18:15.647 --> 01:18:17.731
Party tomorrow night at Omar's, man.

01:18:19.442 --> 01:18:20.901
That's my man!

01:18:38.336 --> 01:18:39.169
Mom?

01:18:40.254 --> 01:18:41.672
Are you okay?

01:18:42.298 --> 01:18:43.715
You know, even when you were a baby...

01:18:43.925 --> 01:18:46.259
you could dance, better
than you could walk.

01:18:47.387 --> 01:18:49.179
It's all you ever wanted to do.

01:18:50.348 --> 01:18:53.266
I still remember the look on your face
your father and I took you to...

01:18:53.476 --> 01:18:55.102
your first dance class.

01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:57.396
You do?

01:19:03.152 --> 01:19:07.990
I never expected that dancing would
bring you such joy after all these years.

01:19:09.909 --> 01:19:13.203
Seeing you up there on
the stage, so happy...

01:19:13.579 --> 01:19:19.668
used to make me happy.
I guess I forgot about that.

01:19:19.877 --> 01:19:21.378
Mom, it's okay.

01:19:21.546 --> 01:19:27.217
I am so excited to see you
dance in your showcase.

01:19:28.886 --> 01:19:29.636
Mom...

01:19:29.804 --> 01:19:31.930
I don't even have a partner anymore.

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:34.891
Tyler's not doing it and Andrew's out.

01:19:35.101 --> 01:19:36.393
Baby...

01:19:38.563 --> 01:19:43.233
You can do this. You've been doing
this by yourself your whole life.

01:19:44.068 --> 01:19:49.072
Come here. You are going to be great.

01:19:49.699 --> 01:19:50.866
Thanks mom.

01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:57.080
I'm still going to win.

01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:58.457
Yeah, we'll see.

01:20:00.293 --> 01:20:04.337
All right, whatever. I'll come back.

01:20:04.547 --> 01:20:05.589
What you all up to tonight?

01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:08.425
Oh... We just goin' over to
Omar's to watch the movies.

01:20:08.634 --> 01:20:11.678
Yeah. I know all about your movies.

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:14.347
You're staying here, you understand?

01:20:14.515 --> 01:20:17.017
What? Ma, I got to go last time.

01:20:17.185 --> 01:20:19.519
Yeah, I know, and that's why
you stayin' here tonight.

01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.938
You boys make sure...

01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:23.398
my baby don't go no where, you hear?

01:20:23.608 --> 01:20:25.484
- Yeah, yeah. All right mom.
- Yes ma'am.

01:20:27.236 --> 01:20:29.071
Hey, don't worry, I'm gonna tuck you in
before you leave, all right man.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.072
Hey, shut up.

01:20:47.548 --> 01:20:49.091
Hey Man!

01:20:56.307 --> 01:20:57.015
So this the spot right here.

01:20:57.225 --> 01:20:57.766
Yeah.

01:20:58.643 --> 01:20:59.559
It's tight.

01:20:59.727 --> 01:21:00.894
Yeah, right.

01:21:01.187 --> 01:21:03.480
I don't know, so what's been going on.

01:21:03.815 --> 01:21:06.691
Man, everything cool. Nora's good.

01:21:06.984 --> 01:21:07.818
Yeah?

01:21:07.985 --> 01:21:09.820
Her boy Andrew quit though.

01:21:09.987 --> 01:21:10.862
What you mean Andrew quit?

01:21:11.072 --> 01:21:13.657
Yeah, he got hurt, can't
dance with her anymore.

01:21:14.909 --> 01:21:19.204
Damn... Whatever man...

01:21:19.413 --> 01:21:22.499
Man, yeah... whatever...
Why don't you stop the bullshitin'.

01:21:22.708 --> 01:21:25.001
I bet you've been mopin' around
just as much as she has.

01:21:25.211 --> 01:21:26.503
What you mean, she's been mopin'?

01:21:26.796 --> 01:21:28.713
I ain't sayin' nothing man.

01:21:28.965 --> 01:21:30.132
Did you see a tear?

01:21:30.675 --> 01:21:32.843
Mopin'.

01:21:33.469 --> 01:21:35.262
Shut up man, let me
introduce to you somebody.

01:21:35.471 --> 01:21:40.475
My man C'. This is Mac.

01:22:02.248 --> 01:22:04.833
I started tearing up like a little girl,
tellin' him...

01:22:05.043 --> 01:22:06.877
that I go to the school of the arts.

01:22:07.504 --> 01:22:09.546
Wait, wait, hold up... You go to the MSA.

01:22:09.923 --> 01:22:10.422
Yeah.

01:22:10.632 --> 01:22:12.549
- That's how you all know each other?
- Yeah.

01:22:12.759 --> 01:22:14.301
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:15.428 --> 01:22:17.554
You don't look like no
art school cat to me.

01:22:17.972 --> 01:22:20.015
What the Hell is an art school cat
supposed to look like?

01:22:20.642 --> 01:22:21.433
Miles Davis...

01:22:21.643 --> 01:22:23.227
Tupac. Mobb Deep...

01:22:23.853 --> 01:22:25.562
Those cats went to art school.

01:22:26.106 --> 01:22:26.605
I'm just sayin'...

01:22:26.815 --> 01:22:28.482
You know what man? Just shut up.

01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:31.902
Yo', what's up!

01:22:32.987 --> 01:22:34.697
Yo, yo, yo. What up, how you all doin'!

01:22:34.906 --> 01:22:36.532
Skinny! What are you doin' here!

01:22:36.783 --> 01:22:38.909
Man, I'm doin' the same thing you is doin'!

01:22:39.244 --> 01:22:40.494
Come on, let's go. Out the door.

01:22:40.745 --> 01:22:41.704
Go. Go!

01:22:41.788 --> 01:22:43.914
- What are you talkin' about man!
- Move! Move!

01:22:44.958 --> 01:22:46.917
Let me be here man! What's wrong with you!

01:22:47.377 --> 01:22:48.127
Let's go...

01:22:48.336 --> 01:22:49.920
What's up baby! How you doin' man?

01:22:50.213 --> 01:22:53.674
Look here... matter of fact, here.
Here's some bus money. Go home.

01:22:53.883 --> 01:22:55.718
Man, why I got to leave?
What you talkin' about!

01:22:55.927 --> 01:22:58.011
No, no, no...

01:22:58.221 --> 01:22:59.430
Go home Skinny!

01:22:59.764 --> 01:23:01.432
Man, let me in!

01:23:07.147 --> 01:23:08.647
What you all laughin' at!

01:23:10.191 --> 01:23:10.858
What up Skinny!

01:23:11.067 --> 01:23:12.276
Don't touch me!

01:23:14.487 --> 01:23:15.279
I'll be back, watch the car.

01:23:15.488 --> 01:23:16.780
Be right here P.J...

01:23:27.041 --> 01:23:28.333
I can't be at the party...

01:23:38.887 --> 01:23:39.845
Hey yo', get me a 40.

01:23:40.722 --> 01:23:41.638
What you got in the bag?

01:23:42.056 --> 01:23:43.015
My music.

01:23:45.935 --> 01:23:47.144
Well do some then.

01:23:47.645 --> 01:23:48.896
You want me to go show him some?

01:23:49.063 --> 01:23:50.022
Yeah.

01:23:53.985 --> 01:23:56.695
DJ, can I get up on your table real quick.

01:24:13.588 --> 01:24:14.838
You're supposed to be watching the car!

01:24:21.221 --> 01:24:22.679
I told you to watch the car man!

01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:26.225
Come get me.

01:25:09.811 --> 01:25:11.103
Yo', you see what your little brother
is doin' outside

01:25:11.312 --> 01:25:11.770
Who?

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:12.813
Your little brother, man!

01:25:14.107 --> 01:25:15.440
He won't listen man!

01:25:21.823 --> 01:25:24.408
Hey yo, Mac size... Bring
the girls out here!

01:25:24.701 --> 01:25:25.576
Yo' that's P.J.'s truck man!

01:25:25.785 --> 01:25:27.578
Skinny, get out of that truck man!

01:25:28.246 --> 01:25:29.162
Man, why!

01:25:29.372 --> 01:25:30.414
Yo', I said get out!

01:25:30.623 --> 01:25:31.498
Hey man, let's go get him!

01:25:43.553 --> 01:25:44.553
Skinny!

01:25:50.184 --> 01:25:52.102
No! No!

01:25:54.272 --> 01:25:56.732
Skinny! Skinny! Say something!
Say something! Say something!

01:25:56.941 --> 01:25:58.817
Talk to me! Talk to me! Talk to me!

01:25:58.985 --> 01:26:00.861
Call somebody man! Do something!

01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:02.404
Call 911!

01:26:02.989 --> 01:26:05.574
Get up! Get up!

01:27:31.995 --> 01:27:32.744
Hey.

01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:40.377
How long you been out here?

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.006
I don't know.

01:27:46.759 --> 01:27:47.884
How's your mom?

01:27:51.097 --> 01:27:53.223
She spoke to me for the first time today.

01:27:58.563 --> 01:28:00.022
Hey, you know they got P.J., right?

01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:02.399
Yeah, but that's not going
to bring Skinny, back.

01:28:07.947 --> 01:28:09.614
This ain't your fault, you know that right?

01:28:09.824 --> 01:28:10.949
That won't bring Skinny back either.

01:28:11.242 --> 01:28:13.076
Look, I just hate seeing you
beat yourself up like this.

01:28:13.244 --> 01:28:14.244
I'm beating myself up?

01:28:14.495 --> 01:28:16.788
We'd been beatin' ourselves up
way before Skinny...

01:28:24.589 --> 01:28:25.922
Look, Skinny's dead!

01:28:26.799 --> 01:28:28.091
He's gone!

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.178
My little brother's gone.

01:28:32.847 --> 01:28:34.389
And that's on me, Ty'.

01:28:34.766 --> 01:28:35.974
I know that.

01:28:37.435 --> 01:28:38.727
I ain't stupid.

01:28:39.228 --> 01:28:43.148
All the partyin', stealin' cars.
Messin' around.

01:28:43.357 --> 01:28:44.816
Don't you think I know
that's a bunch of bull!

01:28:45.026 --> 01:28:46.151
Mac! We're doing the best we can!

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.402
You really believe that?

01:28:48.321 --> 01:28:50.405
You really think this
is the best we can be?

01:28:55.953 --> 01:29:00.415
I want to be better. I want to do better.

01:29:03.795 --> 01:29:04.961
No, you're right.

01:29:05.713 --> 01:29:09.800
I got to do it for my moms. For Skinny.

01:29:15.973 --> 01:29:17.057
For Skinny.

01:29:35.576 --> 01:29:37.244
Will you do me a favor?

01:29:38.538 --> 01:29:39.496
Yeah.

01:29:40.498 --> 01:29:41.873
Will you come somewhere with me?

01:29:50.842 --> 01:29:51.842
Good show tonight.

01:29:54.303 --> 01:29:55.512
Hey Miles.

01:29:57.098 --> 01:29:58.223
What's up?

01:29:58.724 --> 01:30:00.517
Have you heard from Tyler at all?

01:30:00.643 --> 01:30:03.353
Nah, Nah. How's Nora?

01:30:03.855 --> 01:30:04.813
She's good.

01:30:05.106 --> 01:30:06.273
That's cool.

01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:15.657
What was that all about?

01:30:16.659 --> 01:30:17.826
Thanks I guess.

01:30:18.035 --> 01:30:18.743
Hey guys.

01:30:19.871 --> 01:30:21.121
- Hey, what's up.
- Hey.

01:30:21.372 --> 01:30:21.955
Miles, you ready?

01:30:22.165 --> 01:30:23.248
Yeah, you know it.

01:30:23.708 --> 01:30:25.000
Great, see you there.

01:30:29.839 --> 01:30:32.841
Luce'. Have a good show tonight.

01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:34.134
You too.

01:30:56.574 --> 01:31:00.202
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
to this very special evening.

01:31:00.412 --> 01:31:01.995
The fall senior showcase is always...

01:31:02.163 --> 01:31:05.082
a highlight at the Maryland
School of the Arts.

01:31:05.458 --> 01:31:07.668
10 minutes. That's 10 minutes everyone.

01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:10.963
You all right?

01:31:11.464 --> 01:31:12.464
Yeah.

01:31:12.882 --> 01:31:14.508
Give me some, come on.

01:31:22.392 --> 01:31:23.267
Hey yo', thanks man.

01:31:23.476 --> 01:31:24.518
Will you go.

01:31:47.208 --> 01:31:47.916
Nora!

01:31:48.626 --> 01:31:49.710
Tyler what are you doing here?

01:31:49.919 --> 01:31:51.003
Before you say anything...

01:31:53.006 --> 01:31:56.675
Look, I don't know where to start.
I just... I'm sorry.

01:31:57.427 --> 01:31:59.303
Okay, I shouldn't have walked out
on you like I did.

01:31:59.471 --> 01:32:00.637
Tyler this is not the time.

01:32:00.889 --> 01:32:02.347
Please just let me get this out.

01:32:03.433 --> 01:32:07.019
Look, I've made every wrong decision,
I could have possibly made.

01:32:07.228 --> 01:32:09.104
Tyler, it doesn't matter anymore,
I'm doing this without a partner.

01:32:09.314 --> 01:32:11.482
That's enough, go on and
check your dancers.

01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:15.861
Tyler, I don't think you realize
how important this is.

01:32:16.112 --> 01:32:18.280
No, I do realize how important this is.

01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:19.990
And that's exactly why I'm here.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.367
You said, if I want something,
I got to fight for it.

01:32:22.577 --> 01:32:25.746
Right. Well that's what I'm doin',
I'm here and I'm fightin' for somethin'...

01:32:25.955 --> 01:32:27.539
that's real for the first time in my life.

01:32:27.749 --> 01:32:31.293
I can't do this right now. This is
everything that I've been working for.

01:32:31.795 --> 01:32:32.628
I know and I'm sorry...

01:32:32.837 --> 01:32:38.217
I just wanted you to be able to do this,
the way you imagined it. That's it.

01:32:41.137 --> 01:32:44.681
I can't. It's too late.

01:32:49.938 --> 01:32:54.566
Okay. Good luck.

01:33:01.449 --> 01:33:02.366
Tyler!

01:33:09.541 --> 01:33:10.874
Do you remember the steps?

01:33:11.751 --> 01:33:13.669
Couldn't forget them even if I wanted to.

01:33:18.007 --> 01:33:20.592
Okay everyone. We're back to the old dance.

01:33:20.802 --> 01:33:21.760
With Tyler.

01:33:25.181 --> 01:33:26.223
Okay, let's go!

01:33:29.602 --> 01:33:31.395
This is the girl I was telling you about.

01:33:31.938 --> 01:33:32.855
Okay.

01:33:39.487 --> 01:33:40.028
Excuse me.

01:33:40.238 --> 01:33:41.071
Oh, sure.

01:34:07.181 --> 01:34:08.181
Bye...

01:37:04.192 --> 01:37:05.317
Bravo!

01:37:38.476 --> 01:37:39.768
That was all pretty good.

01:37:40.186 --> 01:37:41.770
Come on man, you've seen me dance before.

01:37:41.938 --> 01:37:44.439
Yeah, but not like that, I ain't never
seen you do nothin' like that before.

01:37:45.608 --> 01:37:46.983
That's her right there.

01:37:47.401 --> 01:37:48.110
That's her?

01:37:48.319 --> 01:37:50.695
And over here... This is Nora Clark.

01:37:50.988 --> 01:37:52.864
Wow. You were wonderful.

01:37:53.074 --> 01:37:54.366
Oh thank you so much.

01:37:54.575 --> 01:37:56.034
I'd like to sit down with
you and discuss the...

01:37:56.244 --> 01:37:59.579
possibility of joining our company.
After graduation.

01:37:59.914 --> 01:38:00.705
I would love that.

01:38:00.915 --> 01:38:01.706
Yeah, me too.

01:38:01.916 --> 01:38:06.211
She's everything you said she'd be.
Who's the male lead?

01:38:08.047 --> 01:38:11.299
This is Tyler Gage.

01:38:11.467 --> 01:38:13.385
He's a transfer.

01:38:13.594 --> 01:38:14.469
Oh my God...

01:38:14.595 --> 01:38:15.345
Wait, what?

01:38:15.513 --> 01:38:17.556
Don't forget to send your transcripts.

01:38:18.141 --> 01:38:18.723
Yes, ma'am.

01:38:18.933 --> 01:38:19.599
Very well done.

01:38:20.309 --> 01:38:21.601
We'll see you Monday.

01:38:23.563 --> 01:38:27.232
We'll see you on Monday... Congrats, man.

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:27.941
Appreciate it man.

01:38:28.192 --> 01:38:29.234
I'll let you do your thing,
meet you in the car.

01:38:31.487 --> 01:38:32.237
You should go...

01:38:32.405 --> 01:38:33.864
So you know what that means, right?

01:38:34.115 --> 01:38:35.407
No... What's that mean?

01:38:36.075 --> 01:38:37.993
You're going to have to get some tights.

01:38:38.953 --> 01:38:39.953
Done.
