02:40.027 --> 02:41.097
Your Highness.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.665
Amano.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.705
Maybe you're right.

02:47.801 --> 02:51.149
We've now occupied
fully half of China.

02:51.906 --> 02:55.247
And yet, the Chinese
resistance continues to rise.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.585
We haven't conquered them.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.259
At least not their spirit.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.488
It has come to pass.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.565
Now is the time to rebuild Hades.

03:09.456 --> 03:13.600
Will the Military...
agree to rebuilding it?

03:14.128 --> 03:16.039
They have no choice.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.041
12 years ago

03:24.705 --> 03:30.184
the Military disbanded Hades and
held me prisoner until this day.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.223
Do you really want me to rebuild

03:33.113 --> 03:36.185
Hades from this place?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.791
As long as you are
able to rebuild it

03:40.588 --> 03:42.727
I will see to everything else.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.269
Amano

03:45.859 --> 03:51.372
isn't promoting the spirit of
Hades your lifelong dream?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.548
I need to see someone.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.282
Kurashige Daisuke.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.189
Master.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.219
Do you wish your Invincible Fists

05:53.787 --> 05:55.960
to be forgotten,
to fall into oblivion?

05:57.891 --> 06:02.340
I've waited 12 years
for your order.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.166
You know that I met
with the Prince?

06:05.466 --> 06:06.171
Yes, sir.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.051
Weapons...
can destroy the body.

06:21.115 --> 06:24.657
But only belief...
can conquer the spirit.

06:25.386 --> 06:29.291
The top boxers who
are prisoners-of-war

06:29.490 --> 06:31.766
will be sent to Hades for training.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.166
You have to not just beat them

06:35.629 --> 06:39.475
but also crush their spirit.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.969
Make them fight for
the Japanese Empire.

06:41.970 --> 06:42.743
Yes, sir!

06:59.553 --> 07:01.760
In a month, you,
Kurashige Daisuke

07:02.456 --> 07:05.665
will call back all
the Hades fighters.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.704
Joined by the Empire's
best warriors

07:11.131 --> 07:13.805
you'll rebuild the Hades Shrine

07:14.568 --> 07:16.548
beneath the Southern
Shaolin Temple.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.084
When Hades' spirit
shines across Asia

07:21.875 --> 07:23.718
I'll be granted an amnesty.

07:24.511 --> 07:25.387
Yes, sir!

07:36.123 --> 07:39.593
I'll never let you down.

07:47.668 --> 07:53.346
The two of you were once...
the most gifted, young Hades Warriors.

07:55.409 --> 07:58.413
But when I was arrested

07:59.513 --> 08:01.584
the Shrine was disbanded.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.551
K-29 became a Shaolin
disciple in China.

08:06.053 --> 08:10.627
He was honored as the King of Vajra

08:11.391 --> 08:14.770
and waged a war against the Empire.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.009
I will destroy him

08:19.266 --> 08:21.143
and rebuild Hades.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.814
This is essential to
the Empire's fate.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.481
You must succeed! You cannot fail!

08:26.482 --> 08:28.214
Yes, sir! I understand!

08:28.742 --> 08:33.020
My daughter, Amano Eko is a
journalist based in China.

08:34.681 --> 08:39.397
Through her reports, all your victories
will be known across the world.

08:47.995 --> 08:51.374
*Hades is unbeatable

09:00.240 --> 09:02.379
*Another Chinese fighter
has been defeated

09:07.614 --> 09:10.054
'Multinational soldiers of The
Chinese Army have been captured

09:20.627 --> 09:22.436
*Southern Shaolin

09:51.925 --> 09:52.869
Master.

11:15.008 --> 11:20.054
Big brother, here is the
sand for your hourglass.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.856
The Master says it can calm you.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.889
I washed it in the river for three days,
and then dried it for three more days.

11:25.890 --> 11:28.560
I recited the Energy
Mantra 100 times.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.969
Good boy.
Master...

11:35.962 --> 11:38.442
From your voice, I can tell that

11:38.932 --> 11:44.744
you have yet to master the
17-second Deadly Moves.

11:47.007 --> 11:51.187
You don't have enough strength because
your "qi" isn't strong enough.

11:52.512 --> 11:57.559
And your inner energy is weak
because you hold in your emotions.

11:59.152 --> 12:03.757
The purest emotions are
one's true feelings.

12:04.558 --> 12:09.966
Only when one's feelings are true
can one trigger the Wrath of Vajra.

12:10.497 --> 12:15.239
The Wrath of Vajra is
no ordinary wrath.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.708
The Wrath of Vajra

12:19.306 --> 12:21.547
moderated by compassion

12:22.109 --> 12:25.420
is the true path.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.218
Yes, master. I understand.

12:38.692 --> 12:39.864
Fourteen days.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.771
How much more of this shit?

12:44.865 --> 12:46.105
God will bless us.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.371
Our enemy worships Hades
the Greek God of Death.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.507
No one has ever survived
even with the love of God.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.552
Aren't the Japanese Buddhist?

12:54.574 --> 12:56.520
How could they worship Hades?

12:58.111 --> 13:01.851
I heard they were trained to
be savage killers as kids.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.596
If it is a match,
there must be rules.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.928
There won't be.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.635
It's just a killing game.
Killing game?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.494
You know their rules, Lieutenant?

13:17.631 --> 13:18.701
It's just a guess.

13:26.907 --> 13:32.390
Rossi, when we win the fight,
papa will be coming home.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.794
You're right, Lieutenant.
This is a killing game.

15:24.891 --> 15:25.869
Come!

15:37.537 --> 15:39.907
Stop!
I'll sign!

15:45.245 --> 15:46.883
Don't sign it!

16:13.039 --> 16:16.947
Huang Zhiqiang has the right to
fight the Violence Sean's leader.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.468
This is the Temple of Hades.
Hi.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.472
We're in China.
Speak Chinese.

16:36.763 --> 16:37.503
Who are you?

16:37.630 --> 16:41.668
The Chinese Army's 3rd Battalion
American Lieutenant Bill

16:41.835 --> 16:44.637
In Burma, we fought
alongside Chinese soldiers.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.317
We all speak Chinese.

16:50.010 --> 16:54.723
From now on, everyone has to fight to
be allowed to challenge sect leaders.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.962
Then, if those who are
qualified manage to defeat

16:59.052 --> 17:02.395
three Hades leaders in a
row, they'll be set free.

17:02.922 --> 17:06.460
Those who fail to gain the right can
sign up as training companions.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.964
They'll be allowed
to leave in 2 years.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.771
Those who fail to gain the right
and also refuse to sign up

17:13.165 --> 17:16.980
have to keep on fighting until they sign
up or until they are beaten to death.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.880
Freedom signing the
agreement or death

17:21.407 --> 17:24.214
are the only choices you've got,

18:32.946 --> 18:37.721
If I sign, Can I really leave?

18:38.985 --> 18:40.225
We are soldiers.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.465
We have battled in so many wars

18:44.057 --> 18:46.869
We prefer to die fighting...
than to sign.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.335
Arnold is right.
We have to fight.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.169
No one has ever survived in
the first two years, anyway.

18:52.699 --> 18:53.609
Lieutenant...

18:54.534 --> 18:56.172
You seem familiar with Hades.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.539
I've heard of it.

19:35.375 --> 19:40.088
Is it you who gains
the right to fight me

19:40.413 --> 19:41.551
Tetsumaku Rai, the Vajra of Hell?

19:41.614 --> 19:44.988
Is it you who gains the right
to challenge the Vajra of Hell?

19:45.618 --> 19:49.466
What did you say?
Vajra?

19:52.058 --> 19:55.005
You don't deserve
to be called Vajra.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.608
Bastard!
What did he say?

19:59.032 --> 19:59.772
What?

20:00.200 --> 20:04.508
He said... Tetsumaku doesn't
deserve to be called a Vajra.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.845
Five years ago

20:06.906 --> 20:10.115
in the Japanese army's competition

20:11.244 --> 20:13.588
he beat five boxers in a row.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.785
Five men who also
claimed to be Vajra

20:17.584 --> 20:22.124
He was hailed as the King of Vajra.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.633
Only he...

20:25.325 --> 20:28.204
deserves to be called Vajra.

20:32.098 --> 20:36.073
You...
You're far from it.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.639
King of Vajra...

20:40.640 --> 20:43.917
Only in a great Empire
could you exist.

20:44.043 --> 20:47.249
In a country like China there
are only worthless slaves!

20:47.347 --> 20:49.918
Let Death kiss your ass!

20:52.885 --> 20:53.920
In the boxing ring

20:54.254 --> 20:58.663
when your bones crack and
crumble, you will know

20:59.592 --> 21:04.302
the real King of Vajra.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.765
I understand that you want
to know what Hades means

21:31.557 --> 21:39.167
Take off your clothes.
It seems you've been hiding...

21:39.632 --> 21:41.737
something from your comrades.

21:42.702 --> 21:47.306
A true Hades warrior would
never do that Save your breath

21:47.307 --> 21:48.308
Kurashige Daisuke.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.515
We were kidnapped... and brought
to Hades at the age of ten.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.687
Forced to fight and kill each day,

21:55.248 --> 21:57.285
It's the greatest
shame of our lives.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.401
Shame?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.458
How many people in this world...
have the chance to have their pride...

22:08.795 --> 22:11.776
renewed by the great Hades Temple?

22:13.533 --> 22:17.080
Only by facing death,
actually dancing with death,

22:17.403 --> 22:20.009
can fear be truly conquered.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.446
Only then will human
nature be revealed.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.725
When all the people of the world...
embrace the spirit of Hades...

22:31.984 --> 22:34.260
will we experience
an era of peace...

22:34.587 --> 22:35.827
and a united civilization.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.256
Under your rule?

22:37.657 --> 22:39.830
It is the spirit of
Hades that guides me.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.000
Think, K-23!

22:42.528 --> 22:45.532
Chinese children will
crowd this temple

22:45.765 --> 22:47.176
Just as we did all those years ago.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.203
It's such a stirring moment!

22:50.670 --> 22:53.644
All will become great Hades Warriors
You should join us in training them.

22:53.906 --> 22:57.781
You will be granted both pride...
and freedom.

22:58.444 --> 23:01.485
The world is always made chaotic by...
people with a Messiah complex like you.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.425
For having a peaceful
life with our families.

23:03.426 --> 23:08.461
We prefer to fight because only love...
can conquer the fear of death.

23:08.888 --> 23:09.662
Love?

23:12.792 --> 23:16.269
How many people have you killed...
since joining the Special Force?

23:16.270 --> 23:18.003
We only killed those
that killed others.

23:18.765 --> 23:19.798
What about you two?

23:19.799 --> 23:21.472
My uniform speaks for me.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.480
Enough!

23:25.338 --> 23:28.484
You'll change your mind soon enough.
We'll settle this in the arena.

23:39.719 --> 23:40.493
Master!

23:42.989 --> 23:43.797
Master!

23:43.990 --> 23:45.799
Are you feeling unwell?

23:47.126 --> 23:49.970
Nothing is alone.
Nothing lasts forever.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.141
The Hades' leaders

23:55.835 --> 23:57.371
know you're back.

23:58.371 --> 24:01.375
They posted your
portrait everywhere

24:02.375 --> 24:04.616
and issued a personal
challenge to you.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.451
The devil has arrived.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.053
People are going to suffer.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.894
Protecting our people

24:13.820 --> 24:15.822
and defending our homeland

24:16.656 --> 24:19.637
is everyone's responsibility.

24:20.293 --> 24:20.930
Master

24:21.794 --> 24:25.207
how can a holy man be merciful
when facing a killer?

24:25.832 --> 24:31.674
The devil who slaughters the innocent
is eternally trapped in suffering.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.984
He harms others, but himself also.

24:36.209 --> 24:39.019
He should become enlightened.

24:41.113 --> 24:46.324
This could still be
considered merciful.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.928
Yes, master. I understand.
Do you remember

24:53.359 --> 24:55.862
the Shaolin fist-fighting
techniques

24:56.629 --> 24:59.974
I taught you soon
after you arrived?

26:30.389 --> 26:32.562
Master.

28:33.879 --> 28:38.216
Big brother!

28:38.217 --> 28:39.218
We're in serious trouble!

28:44.056 --> 28:44.556
Hades!

29:15.054 --> 29:17.660
Your parents have already agreed

29:18.157 --> 29:20.993
In this place you'll receive
the very best education.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.333
From this day onwards...

29:22.762 --> 29:25.504
you are members of
the Hades Shrine.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.311
Your parents have already agreed.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.842
In this place you'll receive
the very best education.

29:32.843 --> 29:34.249
I want to go home!

29:34.974 --> 29:37.079
Bastard! How dare you resist Hades!

29:38.043 --> 29:38.851
Stop it!

30:14.079 --> 30:14.955
You can go home...

30:15.614 --> 30:18.926
as long as...
one day...

30:19.418 --> 30:21.261
you have the strength to kill me.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.658
Only then you'll be
allowed to go home.

30:27.026 --> 30:27.800
Remember...

30:28.694 --> 30:32.970
Now you are Warriors of
Hades, And will always be.

31:03.429 --> 31:03.929
Hades!

31:52.544 --> 31:55.020
Kurashige, K-29 is here.

31:58.918 --> 31:59.919
Bring in the guest.

33:17.096 --> 33:20.009
You've burned your bridges with us.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.473
Hand the children back to me.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.078
In your care,

33:24.503 --> 33:27.677
they'll learn the
teachings of Buddha.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.277
But in Hades...

33:30.776 --> 33:33.017
they will become Vajra warriors.

33:33.746 --> 33:35.123
Vajra warriors?

33:35.547 --> 33:37.693
To kill... or to be killed?

33:38.250 --> 33:41.323
The weak will be killed,
The strong will survive.

33:42.721 --> 33:43.927
That is the law of nature.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.457
The law?

33:46.759 --> 33:48.864
This place was once
my childhood home,

33:49.928 --> 33:52.374
But now you turn it
into a hell on earth.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.675
Without the light of
the Hades spirit,

33:55.167 --> 33:56.976
This place is even worse than hell.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.738
The so-called "Hades Spirit"

34:00.906 --> 34:02.715
is no more than the
creation of hell.

34:04.109 --> 34:05.782
Then you force the
innocent to face it.

34:06.078 --> 34:08.284
Although you're now a Shaolin monk

34:09.748 --> 34:14.063
the way you speak...
has not changed at all.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.165
You're still K-29.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.896
Good cannot exist without evil.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.931
If you don't listen,
you'll be destroyed.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.134
Let's solve it by Hades' rules.

34:26.465 --> 34:27.443
I permit you,
without defeating his men

34:27.599 --> 34:30.136
to battle the Violence
Sam's leader.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.993
I've told you those
cracking bones of yours...

34:55.327 --> 34:57.101
will tell you who the
King of Vajra is.

34:58.797 --> 35:02.244
King... of... Vajra!

36:19.678 --> 36:22.522
A devil who slaughters the innocent

36:23.382 --> 36:25.453
is eternally trapped in suffering.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.763
He harms others, but himself also.

36:30.055 --> 36:32.797
He should become enlightened.

36:34.092 --> 36:39.201
This could still be
considered merciful.

36:40.966 --> 36:44.306
Hey, you.
You look damn upset.

36:44.670 --> 36:51.383
None of the men who
fought me survived.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.747
Make atonement for your sins.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.493
It's your turn.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.599
You still refuse to make atonement.

39:23.095 --> 39:25.097
This is your last chance...

40:07.806 --> 40:09.183
Ami-tou-fo

41:16.575 --> 41:17.918
He's getting stronger.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.584
With him here
anything is possible.

41:39.498 --> 41:42.399
K-29 has gained the
right to challenge...

41:42.400 --> 41:45.176
Crazy Monkey, the Vajra of Zombie.

41:45.704 --> 41:48.547
In three days, the duel will be held...
on the suspension bridge.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.388
Thank you!

43:25.837 --> 43:26.838
Long time no see.

43:27.872 --> 43:29.044
Can I come in?

43:34.879 --> 43:36.381
Why did you kill Tetsumaku?

43:38.249 --> 43:39.785
It is the rule of Hades.

43:39.818 --> 43:41.263
I had no choice.

43:42.153 --> 43:45.325
I just want to take the children away.
Even so, do you still have to kill?

43:46.658 --> 43:49.961
In an era of war it's not
necessarily a bad thing

43:50.028 --> 43:51.598
for children to have
strict training.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.376
You only care about winning.

43:55.667 --> 43:58.543
Eko you don't
understand your father.

43:59.304 --> 44:00.578
You understand Hades even less.

44:00.672 --> 44:01.742
My father said...

44:02.140 --> 44:05.212
the Hades spirit makes
the weak strong.

44:05.443 --> 44:07.582
It'll rid Asia of the
white man's rule.

44:07.679 --> 44:11.626
They simply substitute
it with the Hades' rule.

44:13.218 --> 44:17.456
Isn't it better that people could make...
their own choice?

44:19.124 --> 44:21.499
When you witness killing
widespread death

44:21.993 --> 44:27.173
innocent children turned into
killers you can't lie to yourself.

44:27.265 --> 44:31.042
In this place,
I only report the truth.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.247
You really shouldn't come here.

45:09.741 --> 45:11.015
Carry on practicing.

45:11.176 --> 45:12.018
Yes, sir.

45:12.610 --> 45:17.282
The day after tomorrow these Vajra
warriors will be dispatched all over China

45:17.515 --> 45:20.155
to build more Hades' Shrines.

45:20.919 --> 45:22.762
You should remain with them.

45:23.054 --> 45:25.898
The military kills
with tanks and guns,

45:26.991 --> 45:29.528
Hades kills with its belief.

45:30.495 --> 45:34.165
There's no difference between the two.
You say that because you still...

45:34.166 --> 45:38.374
don't understand the beliefs of Hades.
I look forward to my duel with...

45:38.636 --> 45:40.047
Crazy Monkey in two days.

45:41.306 --> 45:42.842
You're too sure of yourself!

45:43.174 --> 45:44.118
I've no choice.

45:49.948 --> 45:53.395
Please allow us to
avenge our master

45:54.819 --> 45:57.163
With your blades?

45:58.123 --> 46:01.866
A samurai's life
belongs to his master.

46:32.791 --> 46:33.633
Enough!

46:38.329 --> 46:40.275
The Chinese think
they can't defeat us

46:40.498 --> 46:42.842
only because we have
better weapons.

46:44.302 --> 46:47.078
They think they could win
with advanced weapons.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.642
The Hades warriors
must disprove that.

46:51.709 --> 46:54.690
We can conquer any opponent...

46:55.446 --> 46:58.689
with our spirits and bodies alone.

47:00.251 --> 47:04.563
In fact, this is at the heart of...

47:04.989 --> 47:06.764
the Japanese victory.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.369
If any Hades warrior...

47:14.132 --> 47:15.543
tries to achieve his goal...

47:16.000 --> 47:19.072
with a weapon

47:24.242 --> 47:27.746
he'll end up like this sword.

47:38.556 --> 47:39.796
The sword in one's mind

47:40.225 --> 47:41.499
is more terrifying.

48:21.766 --> 48:26.545
*The Vajra of Hell, Tetsumaku Rai
defeated the Chinese King of Vajra!

48:34.612 --> 48:36.956
Why did we release false reports?

48:37.715 --> 48:40.787
We don't have courage
to admit failure?

48:40.818 --> 48:42.559
In the Hades Shrine

48:43.121 --> 48:44.964
no failure is permitted...

48:45.323 --> 48:48.861
But I'm a journalist

48:49.127 --> 48:53.473
Reporting the truth is my job.
You're a Hades reporter.

48:54.032 --> 48:56.034
You're responsible for Hades image.

48:56.467 --> 48:58.037
This is your real job.

49:00.338 --> 49:01.874
Facing an opponent
like Crazy Monkey

49:03.207 --> 49:07.246
K-29 is certain to be crushed.

49:08.880 --> 49:13.158
Make sure you get it
right this time.

49:35.873 --> 49:36.873
Huzi!

49:36.874 --> 49:40.087
I'll tell you what...
I discovered many secret passages...

49:40.178 --> 49:41.521
you definitely won't get me.

49:41.579 --> 49:42.683
Well, prove it to me.

49:42.747 --> 49:44.021
Fine, I will.

49:44.215 --> 49:45.353
Hey! Wait for me!

49:45.354 --> 49:46.385
Slow down!

50:02.367 --> 50:03.471
You are...

50:04.202 --> 50:07.649
the future warriors of Hades.

50:08.373 --> 50:12.177
You have to...
take the responsibility

50:12.777 --> 50:16.418
to protect Asia.

50:16.948 --> 50:21.123
Then, the spirit of
Hades will be immortal.

50:22.754 --> 50:26.234
In the future your
indestructible bodies...

50:26.457 --> 50:29.267
and belief in rebirth
after death...

50:29.961 --> 50:35.309
are the key

50:35.633 --> 50:39.206
to conquering the world.

51:01.459 --> 51:04.929
Tetsumaku,
with our deepest respect...

51:05.797 --> 51:07.538
we feel proud of your glory.

51:07.965 --> 51:11.310
We pray for...

51:11.636 --> 51:12.979
your rebirth.

51:40.531 --> 51:41.839
I pray that...

51:42.166 --> 51:44.009
Tetsumaku Rai will be reborn...

51:45.136 --> 51:46.809
and become a man with a kind heart

51:48.306 --> 51:51.219
The truth is not reported as it is.

51:54.245 --> 51:57.715
Believe yourself.
Believe what you see.

51:58.583 --> 52:00.790
Then the truth will be clear.

52:11.796 --> 52:13.002
From today onward...

52:13.764 --> 52:15.937
you'll spread across China...

52:16.367 --> 52:18.210
to setup more Hades Shrines.

52:19.403 --> 52:23.485
The stone bridge is
the path to honor.

52:24.075 --> 52:27.682
Our belief in rebirth
will spread far and wide.

52:28.179 --> 52:32.094
News of your victories will be heard...
in every corner of the Japanese Empire.

52:33.050 --> 52:35.087
You are the pride of Hades.

52:36.454 --> 52:39.230
You'll never disappoint
Master Amano.

52:39.490 --> 52:40.468
Do you understand?

52:40.625 --> 52:41.365
Yes!

52:47.865 --> 52:50.534
Be quick.
You!

52:50.535 --> 52:54.009
Come.
You, come!

52:54.739 --> 52:55.911
Stay calm.

53:10.821 --> 53:11.925
Quickly...

53:59.470 --> 54:00.813
One

54:02.206 --> 54:03.685
Two

54:04.342 --> 54:05.616
Three

54:13.551 --> 54:14.552
Who's there?

54:15.453 --> 54:18.434
You know what?

54:19.390 --> 54:21.131
The offering to the Gods...

54:21.959 --> 54:26.601
isn't allowed to speak.

54:27.698 --> 54:28.836
Come out!

54:32.169 --> 54:33.239
Silence!

54:34.572 --> 54:36.210
This is a sacred ritual.

54:37.041 --> 54:38.850
It's about to begin.

54:43.514 --> 54:46.228
Are you ready?
Come out and fight!

54:46.584 --> 54:48.120
It's your turn.

54:52.590 --> 54:54.433
The taste of blood.

55:04.302 --> 55:07.647
Where you've been hiding.

55:10.708 --> 55:14.685
Rossi, when we win the fight,

55:17.348 --> 55:18.793
papa will return home.

55:58.456 --> 56:02.327
The Oolong tea from Wuyi Mountain...
truly deserves its fame.

56:02.960 --> 56:07.532
If you were a tourist the
tea would smell even nicer.

56:08.532 --> 56:11.975
One day...
I'll retire and return home.

56:12.536 --> 56:17.008
By that time, you should treat me...
as a newcomer, with hospitality.

56:28.819 --> 56:32.266
Look!
How innocent we were!

56:33.958 --> 56:36.199
Every time I see this photo

56:36.694 --> 56:42.476
I hoped we could rebuild
Hades together, you and me.

56:42.967 --> 56:44.708
We're a true family.

56:44.802 --> 56:50.352
Back then we were captured from around
the world and then sold to Hades.

56:51.509 --> 56:53.546
We killed each other
with such cruelty.

56:54.111 --> 56:56.421
A true family would do this?

56:57.014 --> 57:00.954
Back then, in order to
push the Hades spirit...

57:02.086 --> 57:05.430
into the mainstream like
Japanese Militarism

57:06.824 --> 57:08.599
Master risked all
to argue his cause.

57:09.193 --> 57:11.799
The Military sent him to prison.

57:13.330 --> 57:18.544
From there, he sent us a message
asking us to hold to Hades' beliefs.

57:19.870 --> 57:21.543
But you escaped and
returned to China.

57:21.972 --> 57:25.215
You became a Shaolin disciple.

57:25.376 --> 57:27.083
Luckily, he's still
locked up in prison,

57:27.878 --> 57:30.449
or more innocent people would die.

57:34.785 --> 57:37.891
Maybe I should call
you "Saint K-29"?

57:39.490 --> 57:42.768
Ah no... you also have
blood on your hands.

57:43.594 --> 57:48.102
You killed your brother,
K31 with your bare hands.

57:49.900 --> 57:50.640
Huzi!

57:50.701 --> 57:52.908
Brother, we can't fight each other!

57:53.003 --> 57:55.210
We're Hades warriors.
We have to fight.

57:55.573 --> 57:56.711
You can't be a coward.

58:02.546 --> 58:04.116
Huzi! Stop fighting!

58:12.456 --> 58:13.958
Brother!

58:14.625 --> 58:15.658
Are you okay?

58:15.659 --> 58:17.036
Are you all right, brother?

58:17.037 --> 58:18.028
Let go of me!

58:18.295 --> 58:19.205
Brother!

58:19.530 --> 58:20.508
Brother!

58:21.599 --> 58:26.173
My brother's death has
tortured me for twenty years.

58:26.570 --> 58:29.551
That's why I want to
take the children.

58:30.007 --> 58:31.748
You want to shake up...

58:32.343 --> 58:34.949
the great Hades Shrine
single-handedly?

58:35.112 --> 58:36.523
I'll do my best.

58:40.251 --> 58:44.729
When you killed Tetsumaku you didn't
employ the 17-second Deadly Moves.

58:46.590 --> 58:50.769
I hope when you fight Crazy Monkey...
it'll be of use.

58:50.928 --> 58:53.772
I know...
for the sake of the scar...

58:54.498 --> 58:56.478
you've been waiting
to duel with me.

58:58.235 --> 58:59.077
That's right.

59:00.204 --> 59:01.877
I've been waiting for
you for 12 years.

59:03.140 --> 59:04.847
I wish we could finish the fight...

59:05.242 --> 59:07.518
that neither of us managed to win.

59:07.611 --> 59:09.386
I'll definitely grant your wish.

59:15.252 --> 59:16.060
Right

59:19.223 --> 59:23.171
Before the duel, Crazy
Monkey wants to meet you.

59:51.956 --> 59:55.629
Stop.
Freeze!

59:57.995 --> 01:00:01.506
Arnold.
Bastard!

01:00:01.532 --> 01:00:05.507
Get back to the group!
You killed him!

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.247
You killed him!

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:28.767
Bauer.

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:33.638
Bauer.
Bauer.

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:44.046
Finish... me... off!

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:45.852
Be strong! Bauer...

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:49.851
Brother.

01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:53.028
Please... help me.

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:59.432
Finish... me... off!

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:43.907
Who?

01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:45.741
Who killed him?

01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:50.045
He was Crazy Monkey's offering

01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:06.727
Crazy Monkey.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:26.878
Here you are!
Reveal yourself!

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.838
Anger.

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:49.841
Fierce anger.

01:02:53.137 --> 01:03:00.521
That is what helped
you defeat Tetsumaku

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:08.263
It can also defeat you!

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:13.635
A sacred ritual...

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:20.804
needs the perfect offering.

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.978
Like you.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:27.004
The duel tomorrow...

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:28.338
will be the greatest...

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:31.652
Regret in your life.

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:33.886
You'll get your comeuppance.

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:36.355
Prepare yourself.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.551
Who can break...

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:45.327
the eternity of night?

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:49.369
You, don't let me down...
tomorrow.

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:53.440
Tomorrow.

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:55.267
You won't live to see dawn.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.503
Let your anger erupt.

01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:02.551
Don't suppress it.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.617
Let your anger fully erupt.

01:04:58.362 --> 01:04:59.306
Start!

01:05:39.336 --> 01:05:41.213
Go to hell.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:10.842
Eko!

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.076
Good!

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.171
I feel so good.

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:28.795
Read it yourself.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:40.430
*Crazy Monkey has
been killed in China!

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:46.380
My dearest father...

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:48.509
I had always accepted
your teachings

01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:52.048
and believed everything you said.

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:56.255
But now... everything I see here...

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:58.851
contradicts what you preach.

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:06.228
The killings the false
reports and the bullying...

01:12:07.424 --> 01:12:09.131
I wonder if this is
what you call "Hades"?

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:14.099
Today, another sect
leader was defeated.

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.936
Even though I'm just
a journalist...

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:19.012
my conscience reminds
me that our people

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:23.549
have the right to know the truth.

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:29.186
We can't keep fooling
our countrymen.

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:33.724
Your daughter, Eko.

01:12:38.755 --> 01:12:39.665
Master.

01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:28.303
Understand.

01:13:28.304 --> 01:13:29.009
Yes, Sir.

01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:32.782
According to Hades' rules

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:36.784
anyone involved in a riot
should be hanged in public.

01:13:37.514 --> 01:13:40.085
Within three days.

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:43.828
From now on a curfew is
imposed on the Shrine.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.164
Without a pass
all are forbidden to go outside.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:07.921
Rest in peace.

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:11.251
I won't let you die in vain.

01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:18.763
Arnold.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.234
I won't leave anyone here.

01:14:31.668 --> 01:14:33.477
Thank you very much
for all your help.

01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:43.888
Once a master, but
always a father.

01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:49.555
I can never repay all the kindness...
my master showed me.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.231
Is His Highness making any
difficulty for Master?

01:14:54.891 --> 01:14:59.167
His Highness's trust in our master...
never diminishes.

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:02.537
I'm bound to complete
the mission...

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.313
entrusted by
His Highness and Master.

01:15:05.468 --> 01:15:06.310
Yes, Sir.

01:15:06.703 --> 01:15:07.875
Kurashige.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:14.920
I know you're bound
to return to me.

01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:22.828
At the mercy of Kurashige Daisuke
the leader of the Ultimate Sect,

01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:25.493
if the former Hades members

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:27.659
Bill and Kuncai

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:32.967
are willing to fight K-29 to the death
the lives of all prisoners-of-war...

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.364
will be spared.

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:38.203
Don't listen to them If we have
to die, we will die together.

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:40.143
They want us to kill each other.

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:42.141
Don't believe them!

01:15:42.472 --> 01:15:45.680
Yes! We die together if we have to.
Yes! Don't be fooled by them!

01:15:45.681 --> 01:15:47.382
We can't kill each other.

01:15:47.383 --> 01:15:48.617
Don't trust them.

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:50.620
We have to fight together.

01:15:52.115 --> 01:15:53.287
Kurashige,

01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:55.722
we accept your condition.

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:56.987
Lieutenant, are you crazy?

01:15:56.988 --> 01:15:57.987
This is a trap!

01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:04.097
Lieutenant, you can't trust them.
We should live or die together!

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:09.969
If you still regard me as lieutenant
of the Special Force to China

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:12.042
you have to obey my order.

01:16:14.837 --> 01:16:15.577
Brother,

01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:17.645
we know we can't beat you.

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:20.050
Let us enjoy the last
fight of our lives.

01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:22.584
I won't see your final victory.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:25.886
I believe you'll save the children.

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:28.993
Yes... Save the children!

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:49.207
You shouldn't spare us.
Their lives are in your hands now.

01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:23.979
Brother.

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:42.860
Lieutenant.

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:44.334
Pull him away.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:45.868
K-29,

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:48.968
I've granted your wish.

01:17:49.499 --> 01:17:51.479
You killed your own brother.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:52.706
And now...

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:55.979
you killed three of your comrades.

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:59.679
No one in this world
will forgive you.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:03.248
The Hades Shrine is
where you belong.

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:18.101
Hit the renzhong and
fengchi pressure points.

01:18:18.428 --> 01:18:21.201
The points are connected so
they will wake up afterwards.

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:11.687
Qingkong.

01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:17.727
Big brother?
Big brother!

01:19:20.223 --> 01:19:23.965
Take me home!
Take me way from here!

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:30.203
Qingkong.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.401
We can't leave now.

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:34.380
You're the King of Vajra.

01:19:34.704 --> 01:19:36.411
Why not?

01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:38.540
Let's go now!

01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:39.713
Right now!

01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:41.243
I want to go home!

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:41.915
Qingkong.

01:19:43.045 --> 01:19:43.716
Be a good boy.

01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:45.919
We can't leave just yet.

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:49.890
Why can't you take me away?

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:51.887
You're afraid of them.

01:19:51.888 --> 01:19:54.494
You can't take me away.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:57.430
We'll leave.

01:19:59.328 --> 01:20:00.272
Believe me,

01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:04.873
You're not the King of Vajra.
You're afraid of them.

01:20:04.874 --> 01:20:06.505
You can't run away.

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:11.376
You are not capable.
You are not able to take me.

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:13.116
I want to go home.

01:20:16.279 --> 01:20:17.883
I want to go home.

01:20:42.405 --> 01:20:44.009
When you killed Crazy Monkey

01:20:46.509 --> 01:20:48.614
you still didn't use
the Deadly Moves.

01:20:50.213 --> 01:20:54.284
In the realm of Vajra death
is the only reality.

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:57.930
Why do you care about
my Deadly Moves?

01:20:58.788 --> 01:21:01.325
You took a great risk
not to show them

01:21:02.258 --> 01:21:03.999
when facing such a strong opponent.

01:21:04.827 --> 01:21:07.364
You're planning to
take me by surprise.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.705
I can tolerate your
misunderstandings

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.646
but I can't tolerate the fact...

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.043
that my only worthy opponent

01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:19.318
behaves in such a humble manner.

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:21.354
The so-called Deadly
Moves allow you...

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:25.457
to react upon the wrath of the
Vajra moderated by compassion

01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:29.889
and then summon your inner energy to
hit your rival's vulnerable spots.

01:21:30.987 --> 01:21:33.092
There are no sets of moves.
H's all about the will.

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:37.866
May I?

01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:29.910
It's indeed very impressive.

01:23:30.973 --> 01:23:34.187
But you seemed to have weakened
in the last 3 seconds.

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:35.384
I've told you..

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:39.186
There are only deadly minds.

01:23:40.016 --> 01:23:43.057
The only thing you need to conquer...
is your own mind.

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.563
Your martial arts makes you...

01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:47.795
the only worthy
opponent in my eyes.

01:23:48.758 --> 01:23:49.828
I truly hope that...

01:23:50.926 --> 01:23:52.928
we can be friends forever.

01:23:53.662 --> 01:23:58.979
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
When I was little

01:23:59.969 --> 01:24:02.472
I was frightened by
the Hades statue.

01:24:03.239 --> 01:24:06.448
My father said that
Hades followers...

01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:12.787
will eventually become
incredibly strong.

01:24:14.016 --> 01:24:14.790
But now...

01:24:15.985 --> 01:24:18.397
I see that the Hades followers...

01:24:19.655 --> 01:24:21.498
either kill people...

01:24:21.991 --> 01:24:26.133
or are killed.

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:28.036
Tomorrow...

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:30.440
the best fighters will duel.

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:33.672
One of them will die.

01:24:35.905 --> 01:24:37.407
God of Vajra, I beg you.

01:24:38.974 --> 01:24:43.753
Please stop the duel.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.217
Eko.

01:24:47.383 --> 01:24:50.760
Without death there is no birth.

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.263
Is it...

01:24:53.656 --> 01:24:56.830
God's view on life?

01:24:58.961 --> 01:25:00.372
This is a belief.

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:04.037
Only when you hold onto your belief...
can you turn it into power.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.041
My belief is my life.

01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:12.419
I don't want to argue with you...

01:25:13.409 --> 01:25:17.414
It's just that... I don't
want any more people to die.

01:25:19.115 --> 01:25:21.220
Both of you are such
great warriors.

01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:26.723
You should be friends and work
together to save more lives.

01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:30.635
In martial arts,
we could be friends.

01:25:31.827 --> 01:25:33.465
But we can only now
fight to the death.

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:35.601
Eko...

01:25:36.499 --> 01:25:39.407
I know you don't want to...
see either of us die.

01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:43.974
This cannot be prevented.

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:49.387
Tomorrow, your camera
will record it all.

01:25:49.512 --> 01:25:50.252
No!

01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:52.950
I won't take any
more photos for you!

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:57.286
I have to keep a clear conscience.

01:25:58.621 --> 01:26:00.760
You've made your own choice.

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:02.802
Maybe...

01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:07.099
it's true that...
you shouldn't have come here.

01:26:27.082 --> 01:26:27.856
Sumen.

01:26:29.485 --> 01:26:30.225
Sumen.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:31.962
Sumen.

01:26:39.461 --> 01:26:40.531
Who is it?

01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:43.139
Catch him!

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:48.473
Don't let him escape!

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:52.678
Search the cells!

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.882
Now we can be sure that...

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:03.886
he is the one who lit
the sulphur fires.

01:27:04.587 --> 01:27:09.297
They must be plotting a riot...

01:27:09.792 --> 01:27:11.032
when the duel takes place.

01:27:12.194 --> 01:27:14.674
In order to prevent any accident

01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:18.208
I suggest all prisoners
are locked up...

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:20.012
in the Destruction Sect's chamber.

01:27:21.136 --> 01:27:23.241
Fine, do what you must.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.447
We'll go through the
secret passage.

01:27:27.209 --> 01:27:30.383
Keep going down avoid the guards

01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:33.856
we'll arrive right at the prison.

01:27:34.183 --> 01:27:36.254
Okay, follow that plan.

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:42.468
Kurashige.

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:46.167
You're the best Hades
Vajra warrior.

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.473
You are burdened with...

01:27:49.632 --> 01:27:54.581
the mission of
rebuilding the Shrine

01:27:55.904 --> 01:27:58.009
and restoring the glory...

01:27:58.474 --> 01:28:00.784
to the Japanese Empire.

01:28:01.543 --> 01:28:05.116
My hope of being released...

01:28:05.447 --> 01:28:07.290
also rests on you.

01:28:08.317 --> 01:28:12.221
Conquer yourself...
Conquer the others.

01:28:12.588 --> 01:28:15.899
I firmly believe that...

01:28:16.258 --> 01:28:18.602
you can crush K-29.

01:28:21.163 --> 01:28:25.040
As a precaution, I, as the
Head of Hades, order all

01:28:25.734 --> 01:28:28.806
under the High Priest's command

01:28:29.038 --> 01:28:32.307
to kill everyone who
poses a threat...

01:28:32.308 --> 01:28:34.948
including K-29.

01:28:35.577 --> 01:28:37.113
When the duel takes place.

01:28:37.114 --> 01:28:39.580
Guard the children with your lives.

01:28:39.581 --> 01:28:40.559
Yes, Sir!

01:29:26.462 --> 01:29:28.663
You should leave at once.
Quick! Hurry up!

01:29:28.664 --> 01:29:29.665
I won't leave...

01:29:30.265 --> 01:29:31.209
without the children.

01:29:31.834 --> 01:29:34.869
Even if you defeat Kurashige you
won't be able to save them.

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.076
Listen to me. Leave, now!

01:29:36.077 --> 01:29:36.811
Eko.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.150
I won't leave.

01:29:39.742 --> 01:29:41.207
My father ordered
the High Priest...

01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:44.618
to kill you and all the prisoners...
when the duel takes place.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.418
I knew it all along.

01:29:47.683 --> 01:29:48.388
Get out.

01:29:55.457 --> 01:29:56.231
Sumen.

01:29:57.626 --> 01:29:58.331
Stop.

01:30:00.863 --> 01:30:01.841
Quickly! Unlock it.

01:30:02.164 --> 01:30:05.369
Since you know... why are
you sacrificing yourself?

01:30:05.634 --> 01:30:06.738
I've already told you.

01:30:08.404 --> 01:30:09.576
This is my mission.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:11.175
Eko.

01:30:12.007 --> 01:30:14.513
Thank you for reminding me.
Take good care of yourself.

01:30:53.715 --> 01:30:55.490
Go protect the children
in the main hall.

01:31:15.671 --> 01:31:17.048
Since he wants to help you,

01:31:18.507 --> 01:31:20.282
let him witness you
being destroyed...

01:31:20.742 --> 01:31:22.085
with his own eyes.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.416
This is the present I give you...

01:31:27.249 --> 01:31:28.751
A 17-second funeral.

01:31:30.619 --> 01:31:32.223
You can turn on the
switch over there.

01:31:33.222 --> 01:31:34.758
The sand in the
hourglass is falling.

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:37.197
In 17 seconds...

01:31:38.126 --> 01:31:39.935
I'll pay my respects
to your dead body.

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:42.941
Even if my body is broken to pieces

01:31:44.199 --> 01:31:45.701
I'll never give up my mission...

01:31:46.301 --> 01:31:47.862
to stop Hades spreading
to my hometown.

01:32:14.263 --> 01:32:17.210
Bill and Kuncai, lead the
prisoners to start a riot.

01:32:17.499 --> 01:32:18.032
What?

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:19.876
The two are still alive?

01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:23.016
They are rushing
towards the main hall.

01:33:02.344 --> 01:33:04.285
Kill everyone!
Yes, sir!

01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:09.890
Protect the children!

01:33:16.391 --> 01:33:17.335
Hurry up.

01:33:20.162 --> 01:33:20.970
Quickly.

01:33:27.836 --> 01:33:29.213
Protect the children!

01:35:19.715 --> 01:35:20.455
Be careful.

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:32.670
Don't be afraid.

01:35:53.782 --> 01:35:55.819
Sister!

01:35:58.954 --> 01:35:59.830
Eko.

01:36:02.891 --> 01:36:04.097
Bill...

01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:07.263
promise me that...

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:13.144
you'll protect

01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:16.910
all the children.

01:36:17.839 --> 01:36:20.784
Yes, I will.
I definitely will.

01:36:26.081 --> 01:36:27.355
Sister.

01:36:27.883 --> 01:36:29.089
Eko.

01:37:18.733 --> 01:37:20.472
Get Up!
K-29.

01:37:21.036 --> 01:37:24.174
Tell me... who is the
real King of Vajra?

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:28.111
Huzi!

01:37:29.611 --> 01:37:30.851
Huzi!

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:33.523
Huzi!

01:37:34.416 --> 01:37:36.123
Huzi!

01:37:39.454 --> 01:37:40.990
Huzi!

01:37:49.264 --> 01:37:50.208
Huzi!

01:37:58.540 --> 01:37:59.314
Huzi!

01:37:59.741 --> 01:38:00.913
I'm your brother.

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:03.185
Huzi

01:38:04.079 --> 01:38:06.081
I'm your brother.

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:13.622
I'm your brother.

01:38:14.823 --> 01:38:15.767
Brother!

01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:17.501
Brother!

01:38:19.194 --> 01:38:20.002
Huzi!

01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:22.840
Get Up!

01:38:24.599 --> 01:38:26.579
Get Up!

01:39:57.926 --> 01:40:03.308
Only the purest of emotions will
trigger the Wrath of Vajra.

01:40:03.698 --> 01:40:07.236
Then the power of the
Vajra will erupt.

01:41:17.072 --> 01:41:18.312
Hades...

01:41:20.475 --> 01:41:24.115
conquer... without weapons!

01:41:59.781 --> 01:42:01.727
King of Vajra!

01:42:53.568 --> 01:42:55.369
King of Vajra!
Freedom!

01:42:57.138 --> 01:42:58.840
King of Vajra!
Freedom!

01:43:30.071 --> 01:43:32.147
Follow the line.
Be careful.

01:43:36.077 --> 01:43:37.351
You will be home soon.

01:43:39.514 --> 01:43:40.618
Take it.

01:43:43.051 --> 01:43:45.827
Uncle Bill!

01:43:49.958 --> 01:43:51.369
I've informed the army.

01:43:51.526 --> 01:43:53.832
They'll send the soldiers...
to take Hades' men away.

01:43:54.495 --> 01:43:56.840
Well done, everyone!
You know what?

01:43:56.864 --> 01:44:00.506
We didn't know he was K-31 until...
we regained consciousness.

01:44:00.902 --> 01:44:03.246
The Hades men threw
me into the sea.

01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:06.211
My face was torn to
pieces by the rocks.

01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:09.510
Fortunately I was saved by
a Chinese merchant ship.

01:44:09.611 --> 01:44:12.285
I was looking for my
brother everywhere.

01:44:13.881 --> 01:44:18.593
Then I saw the notices that Hades...
put up to challenge my brother.

01:44:18.594 --> 01:44:21.091
So I smuggled myself into the Shrine.
I became the undertaker.

01:44:21.389 --> 01:44:26.194
I knew my brother would come.
Why didn't you tell him earlier?

01:44:26.628 --> 01:44:28.471
He was always guarded
by Hades' men

01:44:28.796 --> 01:44:31.436
I never had the chance
big brother..

01:44:31.437 --> 01:44:34.538
You're the greatest King of Vajra.

01:44:50.251 --> 01:44:53.323
Life can be born
without dying first.

01:44:55.123 --> 01:44:57.296
Love is the key to Heaven.

01:44:58.993 --> 01:45:01.030
Your life showed us the truth.

01:45:01.162 --> 01:45:03.642
You used your life
to preserve dignity.
