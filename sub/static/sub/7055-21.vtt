00:01.718 --> 00:03.747
There is an alternate universe,

00:03.847 --> 00:05.898
and in it
another version of us.

00:05.961 --> 00:07.628
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:07.713 --> 00:09.297
We know who our
enemy is now.

00:09.381 --> 00:11.015
His name is
David Robert Jones.

00:11.082 --> 00:12.266
He's a scientist.

00:12.351 --> 00:13.634
Jones is responsible

00:13.719 --> 00:15.169
for dosing Agent Dunham
with Cortexiphan.

00:15.237 --> 00:16.754
For what purpose?

00:16.805 --> 00:18.589
He was trying to activate
some kind of latent ability.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.857
What are you doing,
Olivia?

00:19.925 --> 00:21.959
I'm turning on
the lights.

00:22.027 --> 00:26.097
I have discovered David Robert
Jones' true intentions.

00:26.165 --> 00:29.817
Jones is trying to collapse
both universes.

00:29.902 --> 00:31.452
Mutual destruction.

00:31.537 --> 00:35.656
And create a world designed
and controlled by him.

00:35.741 --> 00:37.041
Any way to stop Jones?

00:37.108 --> 00:39.410
I'm afraid we have
to close the bridge.

00:47.519 --> 00:49.620
I think
I shall miss them.

Cafe mocha, 1%,

01:22.053 --> 01:22.987
- That's it.
- Jill, can you

01:23.054 --> 01:24.188
get that started?

01:24.239 --> 01:26.157
That'll be $4.80.

02:44.403 --> 02:46.487
<i>Don't move.</i>

02:46.571 --> 02:50.140
I think when they move,
they die.

Please,

05:24.133 --> 05:26.701
Help us.

05:42.215 --> 05:46.385
Maybe the deaths are associated
with this mobile transaction.

05:46.453 --> 05:49.287
No, Walter, this is just
how people pay for things now.

05:49.355 --> 05:50.822
Hmm?

05:50.890 --> 05:53.325
Uh, he probably
just bought that coffee.

Huh.

05:54.694 --> 05:58.697
What will they
think of next?

05:58.765 --> 06:02.000
All we know so far, at 3:23 p.m.
more than two dozen people

06:02.068 --> 06:04.403
experienced some kind of
spontaneous human combustion.

06:04.404 --> 06:05.972
You know that's a myth,
right?

06:06.040 --> 06:07.674
There are
survivors.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.877
Remaining still seems to have
halted the ignition process.

06:09.944 --> 06:11.512
For now.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.381
Do have any idea
what's caused this?

06:13.448 --> 06:16.450
I'm hoping Dr. Bishop can help
shed some light on that.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.128
Okay, my friend.

06:27.195 --> 06:30.230
Let's see
what secrets you hold.

06:30.298 --> 06:32.965
Hmm.

06:33.033 --> 06:37.069
I--I had a watch
similar to this once.

06:37.137 --> 06:41.573
My Uncle gave it to me.
Uncle Heinrich.

06:41.641 --> 06:44.610
He loved rhubarb.

06:44.678 --> 06:47.679
- He was always--
- <i>Am I gonna die?</i>

06:55.221 --> 06:58.223
I--I can't answer that.
Not yet.

07:00.559 --> 07:02.693
What are you?

07:02.761 --> 07:04.329
What am--

07:04.397 --> 07:06.731
I'm human.
What are you?

07:06.799 --> 07:10.068
Is this some sort of
alien invasion?

07:10.136 --> 07:11.470
Are you part of
a strike f--

07:11.537 --> 07:14.373
No, I mean--I mean,
what are you doing here?

07:14.440 --> 07:15.807
Are you a doctor?

07:15.875 --> 07:18.610
Oh, no.
I'm a scientist.

07:18.678 --> 07:20.946
Oh.

07:23.116 --> 07:26.118
Uh...

07:26.185 --> 07:29.088
May I take
a blood sample?

07:29.155 --> 07:31.023
The discomfort
will only be momentary.

07:32.992 --> 07:35.794
That's what
all you men say.

07:38.030 --> 07:41.933
You are very brave.

07:42.001 --> 07:45.036
Go on, then.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.390
I'm sorry...

08:06.458 --> 08:10.061
Um, where did you get this
smudging on your fingertips?

08:10.129 --> 08:12.764
I don't know.

08:12.832 --> 08:15.000
The escalator,
maybe?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.115
Her blood
definitely shows signs

08:28.183 --> 08:30.183
of a foreign incursion
at the cellular level.

08:30.251 --> 08:31.985
Viral?

08:32.053 --> 08:34.821
We're gonna have to get it back
to the lab to be sure.

08:36.424 --> 08:39.159
What sort of virus
are you?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.528
If you were aerolized,

08:40.595 --> 08:41.861
you would have infected
everyone,

08:41.929 --> 08:43.964
not just those
on the escalator.

08:44.032 --> 08:48.169
<i>If you were harbored</i>
<i>on a water tap or a doorknob,</i>

08:48.236 --> 08:53.073
the first few contacts
would have wiped you clean.

08:53.141 --> 08:56.343
What would have kept you
fresh and so infectious,

08:56.411 --> 08:58.311
my lethal friend?

08:58.379 --> 09:01.380
<i>Agent, I think</i>
<i>we found something.</i>

09:11.356 --> 09:15.459
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

09:15.527 --> 09:18.462
This is not a virus
at all.

09:18.529 --> 09:21.698
Well,
then what is it?

09:21.766 --> 09:24.234
The escalator is infested
with nanites.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.436
<i>Nanites?</i>

09:25.503 --> 09:27.505
Microscopic self-replicating
robotics.

09:27.572 --> 09:29.073
There's a machine
that's generating them.

09:29.141 --> 09:30.775
Despite their itty-bitty size,
each of them

09:30.843 --> 09:32.877
is capable of storing
a tremendous amount of energy,

09:32.945 --> 09:34.946
and it would seem
they can be overloaded

09:35.014 --> 09:36.681
by the bio-kinetic
energy

09:36.749 --> 09:40.519
stored in the cells
of anyone infected.

09:40.586 --> 09:42.121
You mean,
these people's movement

09:42.188 --> 09:43.355
is what's activating
the nanites?

09:43.423 --> 09:45.257
That's what I just said.

09:45.325 --> 09:47.559
And the longer
they are in the bloodstream,

09:47.627 --> 09:49.494
the more sensitive
they become,

09:49.562 --> 09:52.329
so that the slightest exertion
can trigger the overload.

09:52.397 --> 09:54.331
Causing them
to spontaneously combust.

09:54.399 --> 09:56.700
Like a soda pop bottle
after shaking.

09:56.768 --> 09:59.602
Okay, so who would do this,
and how do we stop it?

09:59.670 --> 10:01.971
I don't know.
I need my lab.

10:02.039 --> 10:03.439
But we can't move them,
Walter.

10:03.507 --> 10:04.641
How are we gonna get
one of these people to your--

10:04.708 --> 10:06.309
Very carefully.

10:06.377 --> 10:07.944
Walter,
we can't risk it.

10:08.012 --> 10:11.214
I don't know how long
they have left,

10:11.282 --> 10:12.549
even without
moving them.

10:12.616 --> 10:14.150
<i>I can't</i> <i>be certain.</i>

10:14.218 --> 10:17.788
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>any kind of insurance?</i>

10:17.856 --> 10:21.025
I mean, if I volunteer
for your experiment

10:21.093 --> 10:24.128
and something goes wrong,
what happens,

10:24.196 --> 10:25.596
you know,
to my next of kin?

10:25.664 --> 10:27.699
<i>The Bureau</i>
<i>takes care of you.</i>

10:27.767 --> 10:30.035
Everybody that we work on
is fully-covered.

10:30.103 --> 10:33.472
It's in the regs.

10:33.540 --> 10:37.443
Okay.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.812
You can use me.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.249
Whatever you need.

10:43.316 --> 10:44.683
I'm sorry,
what's your name?

10:44.751 --> 10:48.120
Jessica Holt.

10:48.188 --> 10:51.223
Do you know
what you're saying, Jessica?

10:53.626 --> 10:57.328
Yeah, I do.

10:57.396 --> 10:59.230
I need a solid-board
stretcher.

10:59.298 --> 11:02.033
Uh, and some ice packs
and a blanket.

11:24.299 --> 11:27.635
Must seem
a little bizarre, huh?

11:27.703 --> 11:31.705
Well, I'm an E.R. nurse.

11:31.773 --> 11:33.774
Night shifts on Fridays,
that's bizarre.

11:36.343 --> 11:38.211
If there anything
that I can do to make it

11:38.279 --> 11:41.781
a little more pleasant,
please let me know.

11:41.849 --> 11:43.149
Actually, there is.

11:43.217 --> 11:45.618
Um, could you get
my phone for me, please?

11:45.686 --> 11:47.453
It's in my handbag.

11:47.521 --> 11:49.856
Of course.

11:52.860 --> 11:56.063
Thank you.

12:02.004 --> 12:04.539
Mike, it's me.

12:04.607 --> 12:05.740
No, I know.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.209
Um. Yeah.
Listen,

12:08.277 --> 12:10.211
I, um, I need you
to pick up Sarah

12:10.279 --> 12:14.649
after school for me,
please.

12:14.716 --> 12:16.083
No, I--I know
it's not your day,

12:16.151 --> 12:19.587
um, but, you know,
please, Mike.

12:19.655 --> 12:24.892
Um, I'll explain it
to you later, okay?

12:24.960 --> 12:27.695
Okay, bye.

12:27.762 --> 12:29.963
- Thanks.
- Of course.

12:34.068 --> 12:38.471
<i>Olivia, how long until this</i>
<i>antidote is ready?</i>

12:41.140 --> 12:42.807
I'll just
check with Walter.

12:47.145 --> 12:48.446
How close are we?

12:48.513 --> 12:50.448
We're starting to see
first results now.

12:50.516 --> 12:52.216
But how long
is it going to take?

12:52.284 --> 12:55.720
At this rate, it's gonna be
at least a couple more minutes.

12:55.788 --> 12:58.256
Hey, Walter, her temperature's
rising rapidly.

12:59.325 --> 13:00.526
How rapidly?

13:00.593 --> 13:03.329
Uh, two degrees
in the past 23 seconds.

13:03.397 --> 13:04.997
What about
an ice bath?

13:05.065 --> 13:07.867
No, that won't help.
Just try to keep her calm.

13:08.935 --> 13:10.336
Jessica?

13:10.404 --> 13:12.904
Jessica, I just want you
to focus on me, okay?

13:12.972 --> 13:14.139
Okay.
<i>Peter,</i>

13:14.207 --> 13:15.374
grab
the ammonium nitrate.

13:15.441 --> 13:16.475
You want to speed up
the condensation?

13:16.543 --> 13:17.710
Unless you have
a better idea.

13:17.777 --> 13:19.278
Walter,
she's at 104 degrees.

13:19.346 --> 13:20.480
Uh, we need
60 seconds more.

13:20.548 --> 13:22.282
We don't have
60 seconds.

13:22.350 --> 13:23.583
Oh, my God.

13:23.651 --> 13:24.618
Get away from me!

13:24.685 --> 13:25.719
Oh, here.

13:25.787 --> 13:27.120
<i>Jessica,</i>

13:27.188 --> 13:29.055
<i>just focus</i>
<i>on your breathing.</i>

13:30.924 --> 13:31.924
<i>Walter!</i>

13:31.992 --> 13:33.092
40 sec--
seconds more!

13:44.014 --> 13:46.248
<i>How are you</i>
<i>doing that?</i>

13:46.316 --> 13:48.083
<i>Her temperature's</i>
<i>dropping.</i>

14:12.077 --> 14:13.578
Oh--

14:13.645 --> 14:16.047
<i>she's okay.</i>

14:20.118 --> 14:23.120
How did you do that?

14:24.122 --> 14:27.390
I have no idea.

14:36.969 --> 14:38.836
This should
permanently remove

14:38.920 --> 14:40.838
and neutralize the nanites
in your system.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.390
Thank you.

14:42.457 --> 14:44.008
I can breathe now.

14:44.092 --> 14:48.396
You and a lot
of other people.

14:48.463 --> 14:53.100
Walter, do you have any idea
what just happened to me?

14:53.151 --> 14:56.437
I could make
an educated guess.

14:56.488 --> 15:00.491
Cortexiphan has given you
certain kinetic powers.

15:00.575 --> 15:02.827
Moving molecules
so quickly

15:02.911 --> 15:06.697
that you can create
spontaneous combustion, yes?

15:06.782 --> 15:10.618
Well, perhaps in this case,
you slowed the molecules down,

15:10.669 --> 15:14.505
causing her
to cool down.

15:14.589 --> 15:16.924
But <i>how</i>
did I do it?

15:16.991 --> 15:20.428
I'm afraid
I have no idea.

15:25.166 --> 15:28.168
I should
get her home.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.309
You'll let me know what happens
with the others, then?

15:35.360 --> 15:36.694
I will,
but now that

15:36.778 --> 15:38.029
the antidote's
been synthesized,

15:38.113 --> 15:40.197
they'll all be fine,
thanks to you.

15:40.282 --> 15:42.867
Thank <i>you.</i>

15:42.951 --> 15:47.288
I don't know how you did it,
but you did.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.544
You know, not everybody
would volunteer

15:53.628 --> 15:54.912
to be Walter's
guinea pig.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.631
It wasn't really for me.

15:57.699 --> 15:59.667
I've got a four-foot-tall
redhead at home

15:59.718 --> 16:02.503
who's constantly in dire need
of mac and cheese

16:02.554 --> 16:04.472
and help with her math.

16:04.539 --> 16:07.007
And her father's an idiot.

16:07.059 --> 16:09.009
Well,

16:09.061 --> 16:10.678
if you ever need help
getting to the head

16:10.729 --> 16:12.646
of the line in an E.R...

16:12.714 --> 16:15.266
And listen, if you find
that you have any more symptoms,

16:15.350 --> 16:16.517
give me a call.

16:16.568 --> 16:18.569
I will.

16:18.653 --> 16:20.020
Thank you.

16:20.072 --> 16:22.523
Thank you.

16:22.574 --> 16:24.492
Thanks.

16:24.559 --> 16:27.394
Bye.

16:29.564 --> 16:31.532
- Dunham.
<i>-  We know who's responsible</i>

16:31.583 --> 16:33.167
<i>for the nanites.</i>

16:33.234 --> 16:35.119
<i>This was taken</i>
<i>ten minutes before</i>

16:35.203 --> 16:38.205
the first victim
was reported.

16:43.945 --> 16:45.963
Another camera picked him up
leaving the scene,

16:46.047 --> 16:47.548
but we lost him
after that.

16:47.599 --> 16:50.217
Well, at least we know
Jones is in our universe.

16:50.285 --> 16:52.470
So what does infecting
a bunch of people with nanites

16:52.554 --> 16:54.605
have to do with
ending the world?

16:54.689 --> 16:56.223
I mean,
everything Jones has done

16:56.274 --> 16:58.476
has been in service of
collapsing our two universes

16:58.560 --> 17:00.111
in order
to create a third.

17:00.195 --> 17:02.229
But destroying the bridge
ruined that plan.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.031
As far as we know.

17:04.098 --> 17:05.398
You think he found
another way

17:05.450 --> 17:07.201
to create his own universe
in place of ours?

17:07.268 --> 17:09.203
I don't know.

17:09.270 --> 17:10.688
<i>But we do know Jones.</i>

17:10.755 --> 17:13.773
We know he's not
gonna just give up.

17:18.096 --> 17:20.815
No.

17:20.882 --> 17:22.750
That can't be.

17:22.818 --> 17:29.056
A chimeric structure in nanites.
I don't believe it.

17:29.123 --> 17:30.641
That was Olivia.

17:30.725 --> 17:33.727
David Robert Jones
is definitely behind this.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.900
Walter,
what is it?

17:39.968 --> 17:42.186
A hundred different ways
to design a nanite,

17:42.270 --> 17:43.988
and he chose this.

17:44.072 --> 17:45.873
It's inconceivable.

17:45.941 --> 17:47.408
Not by chance.

17:47.475 --> 17:49.109
Jones isn't smart enough,
not by himself.

17:49.161 --> 17:50.661
Wait,
what are you saying?

17:50.745 --> 17:52.329
Jones didn't create
these nanites.

17:52.414 --> 17:55.032
They're not
his design!

17:55.116 --> 17:57.618
There's only
one person

17:57.669 --> 18:01.956
who would construct
this particular pattern.

18:02.007 --> 18:03.824
Who?

18:22.277 --> 18:25.145
I have bad news, sir.

18:25.197 --> 18:28.199
Agent Dunham
has stopped us again.

18:40.962 --> 18:44.698
Don't be so sure.

18:51.082 --> 18:53.734
Olivia beat us
today.

18:53.802 --> 18:57.488
<i>Clearly, you don't</i>
<i>seem concerned.</i>

18:57.555 --> 19:01.425
Don't confuse a winning move
with a winning game.

19:03.461 --> 19:07.548
This board
never changes.

19:07.599 --> 19:10.184
How long do you take
between moves?

19:10.251 --> 19:12.252
Since
the last move...

19:12.303 --> 19:16.390
about 20 years.

19:16.441 --> 19:18.275
In this game,
the skill one must have

19:18.360 --> 19:21.128
above all else
is patience.

19:21.196 --> 19:25.932
The board changes,
but very slowly.

19:25.984 --> 19:30.704
The art of chess,
the art is knowing

19:30.772 --> 19:33.540
when a piece
is most valuable,

19:33.608 --> 19:35.609
and then,
in that very moment,

19:35.660 --> 19:37.878
being willing
to sacrifice it.

19:37.945 --> 19:40.798
For in the vacuum
created by the loss

19:40.882 --> 19:44.585
of what is most precious,
opportunity abounds,

19:44.636 --> 19:46.920
influence
is maximized,

19:46.971 --> 19:51.742
and desire becomes
destiny.

19:51.810 --> 19:55.145
For example,
on this board,

19:55.230 --> 19:59.316
the most valuable piece
is the Bishop,

19:59.401 --> 20:02.820
therefore,
for the game to be won...

20:02.904 --> 20:05.906
The Bishop
must be sacrificed.

20:09.744 --> 20:12.112
I'll attend to it.

20:12.163 --> 20:14.698
Promptly.

20:17.813 --> 20:20.298
He's alive.
I'm telling you, he's alive

20:20.349 --> 20:23.401
I knew that Jones's plan
was too ingenious,

20:23.469 --> 20:24.903
too remarkable,

20:24.970 --> 20:26.571
that it had to have
come from Belly.

20:26.638 --> 20:27.989
He's alive, Nina.

20:28.074 --> 20:30.942
The nanotech that Jones used
on the escalator,

20:30.993 --> 20:34.412
I've examined them.
They were built by Belly.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.997
I--I'd recognize
his work anywhere.

20:36.082 --> 20:37.499
His methodology
was all ov--

20:37.583 --> 20:39.951
Jones had access to many
projects at Massive Dynamic.

20:40.002 --> 20:42.170
He could simply have copied
William's research--

20:42.254 --> 20:44.989
Nina, it was the work of
a master, not an imposter!

20:45.040 --> 20:47.675
I know the difference.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.627
Walter said that Bell died
in a car accident

20:49.678 --> 20:51.463
on New Year's day
seven years ago?

20:51.514 --> 20:55.266
Yes. I went to the hospital.
I saw his body.

20:55.334 --> 20:57.635
But it wasn't New Year's,
it was Christmas.

20:57.686 --> 21:00.772
I--I always thought
that he died on New Year,

21:00.839 --> 21:04.692
because he came to visit me
the night before to say goodbye.

21:04.777 --> 21:06.528
Walter, what are you
talking about?

21:06.612 --> 21:10.014
When I was in St. Claire's,
Belly came to visit me.

21:10.065 --> 21:13.535
It was
New Year's Eve, 2005.

21:13.619 --> 21:16.171
They gave me additional shocks
that day just to celebrate,

21:16.238 --> 21:18.206
<i>so I can't remember</i>
<i>what he said.</i>

21:18.274 --> 21:19.690
Nina, I know
you loved him--

21:19.742 --> 21:22.127
Oh, Walter,
just stop it!

21:22.194 --> 21:25.530
The car crash
wasn't an accident.

21:25.581 --> 21:28.550
William had lymphoma.
He'd been trying to fight it,

21:28.634 --> 21:30.468
but...

21:34.056 --> 21:36.508
I think he didn't want me
to see him that way anymore.

21:36.559 --> 21:38.226
He didn't want
to be vulnerable.

21:38.310 --> 21:40.395
He wanted to go out
on his own terms, and he did.

21:40.479 --> 21:41.513
It's still possible--
Oh, Walter,

21:41.564 --> 21:43.314
anything is possible,

21:43.382 --> 21:46.217
but the man I knew wouldn't try
to destroy a universe.

21:46.268 --> 21:48.319
That doesn't
sound like William.

21:48.387 --> 21:49.988
<i>Fine.</i>

21:50.055 --> 21:52.740
I'll prove it to you.

21:52.825 --> 21:55.527
If my son is not too busy
monitoring my cure,

21:55.578 --> 21:57.996
I'd like him
to meet us.

21:58.063 --> 22:00.064
Where?

22:38.821 --> 22:42.624
<i>Well, well...</i>

22:42.708 --> 22:44.742
Wally Bishop.

22:44.793 --> 22:46.711
Hey, Doc,

22:46.778 --> 22:52.000
<i>you just visiting, or are you</i>
<i>coming back to stay for awhile?</i>

22:56.455 --> 22:58.723
Good news.

22:58.790 --> 23:02.460
The administrator
can see us now.

23:02.511 --> 23:03.645
Everything okay?

23:03.729 --> 23:06.731
Fine.

23:09.985 --> 23:11.802
I'm sorry,
we're still transitioning

23:11.854 --> 23:14.656
to a more up-to-date
record-keeping system.

23:14.740 --> 23:16.807
Federal funding
isn't all it used to be.

23:16.859 --> 23:19.427
In fairness, I'm told
it never was particularly good,

23:19.495 --> 23:22.080
so, technically, it never was
what it used to be.

23:22.147 --> 23:24.449
I guess now
it's just worse.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.168
But I'm confident these
are all the visitor logs

23:27.253 --> 23:28.503
during the period
of Dr. Bishop's--

23:28.587 --> 23:31.656
incarceration.

23:31.707 --> 23:33.508
I was going to say
"treatment."

23:33.592 --> 23:36.511
It has a nicer sound,
and I like to think

23:36.595 --> 23:38.162
is more reflective
of what we do here.

23:38.213 --> 23:41.633
Would you, now?

23:41.684 --> 23:44.001
What about your
surveillance archives?

23:44.053 --> 23:45.770
Uh, security cameras?

23:45.837 --> 23:49.107
I'm afraid our current mainframe
storage capacity is limited.

23:49.174 --> 23:51.776
The institution doesn't keep
anything older than two years.

23:51.843 --> 23:52.977
How convenient.

23:53.028 --> 23:54.479
<i>Walter,</i>

23:54.530 --> 23:57.848
Dr. Benlo has been
cooperating fully.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.701
Do you see anything
in those

23:59.785 --> 24:01.452
that suggests the logs
have been doctored?

24:01.520 --> 24:02.654
No.

24:02.705 --> 24:04.188
Matter of fact,
they're perfect.

24:04.239 --> 24:06.357
Very thorough.

24:06.408 --> 24:09.127
Every single individual
logged in and out.

24:09.194 --> 24:10.712
<i>And?</i>

24:10.796 --> 24:13.214
No William Bell.

24:15.884 --> 24:20.705
Walter, you said you had been
having a lot of shock therapy.

24:20.756 --> 24:23.341
Do you think perhaps he
could have been a hallucination?

24:23.392 --> 24:24.892
No.

24:24.977 --> 24:26.678
No, no.

24:26.729 --> 24:31.015
My hallucinations were rarely
biped and never men.

24:42.945 --> 24:44.061
Dr. Bishop, are you--

24:44.113 --> 24:47.398
Crazy?

24:48.584 --> 24:51.736
No.

24:51.787 --> 24:53.705
May I borrow this?

24:53.772 --> 24:55.740
Uh, um,

24:55.791 --> 24:58.676
well, those records have
already been digitized, I--I--

24:58.744 --> 25:00.261
Thank you.

25:00.346 --> 25:02.347
Let's go.

25:04.133 --> 25:06.300
Thank you.

25:07.419 --> 25:08.770
I must say,

25:08.854 --> 25:12.590
you're much prettier
than your predecessor.

25:21.933 --> 25:24.435
I still don't know why Walter
needed that log book,

25:24.486 --> 25:26.037
and he's not telling me,

25:26.104 --> 25:29.207
and he won't back off
that Bell thing, either.

25:29.274 --> 25:30.541
Oh, man.

25:30.609 --> 25:31.909
Oh.
One, second, hold on.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.211
I got it.

25:33.278 --> 25:35.046
God.
Oh, that's got to smart.

25:36.948 --> 25:38.783
That's what happens
when you drink and mince.

25:39.968 --> 25:42.470
Thank you.

25:42.554 --> 25:46.791
What's the matter?

25:46.842 --> 25:48.810
You worried about Walter too,
'cause honestly,

25:48.894 --> 25:50.228
you shouldn't be.
I'm sure he's--

25:50.295 --> 25:52.397
No, I'm not thinking about
Walter.

25:56.902 --> 26:00.438
I was thinking about
that girl, Jessica.

26:00.489 --> 26:02.973
Oh, one encounter with us
and her child

26:03.025 --> 26:05.810
almost becomes an orphan.

26:05.861 --> 26:10.248
And we deal with this
every day.

26:10.315 --> 26:12.834
We're playing the odds,
Peter.

26:12.918 --> 26:14.419
I mean, what do you
really think

26:14.486 --> 26:17.488
our chances are
of having a normal life?

26:20.926 --> 26:22.093
Olivia, I know
you're scared about

26:22.160 --> 26:23.845
what happened in the lab
yesterday.

26:23.929 --> 26:26.681
I don't know
what's happening to me.

26:26.765 --> 26:28.466
What I'm becoming.
I've got this--

26:28.517 --> 26:30.601
this power inside me
that terrifies me

26:30.669 --> 26:31.853
because I don't
understand it,

26:31.937 --> 26:33.187
and I just--
I just want it out.

26:33.272 --> 26:34.772
Okay.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.525
So we'll
figure it out.

26:37.609 --> 26:40.211
Together.

26:40.279 --> 26:43.281
Is that
a personal guarantee?

27:00.699 --> 27:03.134
After all
we've been through,

27:03.201 --> 27:07.221
I will not lose you again,
Olivia.

27:14.780 --> 27:16.046
I'm starving.

27:17.232 --> 27:18.382
What's a guy got to do
to get

27:18.433 --> 27:21.218
a good home-cooked meal
around here?

28:15.328 --> 28:16.695
<i>Where are you now?</i>

28:16.746 --> 28:18.163
We're just passing
Kenmore Square.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.581
Now, what do you mean,
it's the sun?

28:19.665 --> 28:20.999
Well, even though
we can't see it,

28:21.066 --> 28:22.250
it's still there
in the sky.

28:22.335 --> 28:24.035
Jones must be
reflecting the light

28:24.086 --> 28:26.505
off of something,
like one of those disco balls,

28:26.572 --> 28:28.006
<i>and then focusing it,</i>

28:28.073 --> 28:29.674
<i>like we do</i>
<i>with a magnifying glass.</i>

28:29.742 --> 28:31.209
Well, how is he
doing that?

28:31.260 --> 28:33.261
Well, I'm not sure yet,
but I have my suspicions.

28:33.346 --> 28:38.049
Yeah, Farnsworth.
Agent ID: JH112402.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.584
And why
is he doing it?

28:39.635 --> 28:41.219
Seems like he's trying
to burn a hole to China.

28:41.270 --> 28:43.054
It's a myth.
Technically,

28:43.105 --> 28:44.556
it would be India,
but I doubt it.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.391
<i>What does this have to do</i>

28:46.459 --> 28:47.792
<i>with nanites? And how do we</i>
<i>even know it's Jones?</i>

28:47.844 --> 28:49.595
So you are now
prepared to concede

28:49.646 --> 28:51.813
that this may well be
the work of William Bell?

28:51.898 --> 28:54.132
- <i>Not my point.</i>
- Okay, thanks.

28:54.183 --> 28:55.317
Satellite imagery?

28:55.401 --> 28:57.069
Yeah, I just got access
to the system.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.404
Radio waves.

29:00.690 --> 29:01.990
It's coming online
right now.

29:02.075 --> 29:03.909
I need geological data
on Beacon Hill.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.577
Walter, which one of these
do you want me to do first?

29:05.645 --> 29:07.145
All of them.

29:07.196 --> 29:09.998
Uh, you said that
Agent Broyles was on-site?

29:10.083 --> 29:11.483
Is he evacuating
the area?

29:11.534 --> 29:13.485
Yes, one square mile
from the center of the beam.

29:13.536 --> 29:15.820
Okay, Walter,
the geological's printing.

29:18.991 --> 29:19.925
Oh, no.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.510
Oh, no, what?

29:21.594 --> 29:22.994
<i>I knew I'd read something</i>
<i>about this.</i>

29:23.046 --> 29:26.131
Three months ago,
a subterranean oil reservoir

29:26.182 --> 29:28.267
was discovered
below Beacon Hill.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.801
What does that mean?

29:29.852 --> 29:32.671
Imagine putting a match
to a can of lighter fluid.

29:32.722 --> 29:34.839
<i>Unless</i>
<i>we stop this soon,</i>

29:34.891 --> 29:38.610
the sunbeam will essentially
set Boston on fire from below.

29:38.678 --> 29:41.029
Uh, Peter, you should
alert Agent Broyles.

29:41.114 --> 29:43.031
<i>Tell him that he'll need</i>
<i>to evacuate an area</i>

29:43.116 --> 29:44.983
<i>uh, with a radius</i>
<i>much wider than one mile.</i>

29:45.034 --> 29:45.984
Well, how much?

29:46.035 --> 29:46.985
All of it.

29:47.036 --> 29:47.986
All of what?

29:48.037 --> 29:50.155
Boston.

29:50.206 --> 29:52.124
We'll call you back.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.125
Walter,
you're right.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.376
There is
a radio frequency

29:54.460 --> 29:55.877
that's not owned
by the government

29:55.962 --> 29:57.696
that's transmitting
in the S-band.

29:57.747 --> 29:58.714
What's the frequency?

29:58.798 --> 30:01.533
2202.518.

30:01.584 --> 30:03.802
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>there's two frequencies.</i>

30:03.869 --> 30:05.137
What?

30:05.204 --> 30:08.707
Also .520.

30:08.758 --> 30:11.059
Of course.

30:11.144 --> 30:14.680
You brilliant bastard,
Belly.

30:14.731 --> 30:17.733
Quick, give me something
to write on.

30:21.938 --> 30:23.655
Dunham.

30:23.723 --> 30:25.223
<i>Turn around, head south!</i>

30:25.274 --> 30:26.908
Towards Beech Street,
on the edge of Chinatown.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.059
<i>Why? What's there?</i>

30:28.111 --> 30:30.061
I believe
that's where Jones

30:30.113 --> 30:31.830
is commanding
the satellites from.

30:31.897 --> 30:33.532
What satellites,
Walter?

30:33.583 --> 30:36.335
<i>I think Jones has commandeered</i>
<i>two private satellites,</i>

30:36.402 --> 30:38.086
<i>or maybe he'd launched them,</i>
<i>and they're</i>

30:38.171 --> 30:40.839
the disco balls that are
bouncing the sunlight

30:40.906 --> 30:42.507
around the planet.
In any case,

30:42.575 --> 30:44.409
I have triangulated the signals,
and they appear to be coming

30:44.460 --> 30:46.878
<i>from the 1600 block</i>
<i>off Beech Street.</i>

30:46.929 --> 30:51.516
Interrupt the signals
and you shut off the sun.

30:51.584 --> 30:52.851
Well, you know
what I mean.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.354
Okay,
we're on our way.

30:57.273 --> 31:00.275
Ah! Get me a knife.
My lemon cake's ready.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.195
<i>Walter,</i>
<i>if you were hungry,</i>

31:03.262 --> 31:05.113
<i>I could've gotten you</i>
<i>something.</i>

31:05.198 --> 31:07.432
This is not about food,
Athos,

31:07.483 --> 31:09.067
this is about Bell.

31:09.118 --> 31:11.453
Where's the knife?

31:11.537 --> 31:15.524
Please, quickly?

31:26.969 --> 31:29.054
Hoo.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.123
All right.
This is the 1600 block.

31:32.175 --> 31:33.141
<i>See anything?</i>

31:33.226 --> 31:34.793
Peter, look.

31:34.844 --> 31:36.561
<i>That antenna.</i>
<i>Do you think</i>

31:36.629 --> 31:39.481
<i>that's what's controlling</i>
<i>the satellites?</i>

31:42.301 --> 31:43.652
Could be.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.737
There's
the other one.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.825
Okay, I'll take this one,
you take the other one.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.660
Okay, but I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.161
We got to
turn them off.

31:53.246 --> 31:56.248
We'll just figure it out
when we get up there.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.368
Oh, my God,
that smells terrible.

32:26.619 --> 32:27.569
What is it?

32:27.620 --> 32:28.620
Lemon cake,

32:28.705 --> 32:31.373
<i>laced with pig brain.</i>

32:31.441 --> 32:32.941
- What?
- Hmm?

32:32.992 --> 32:36.111
Lemon cake is
the perfect incubator.

32:38.298 --> 32:41.717
And I thought it was easier
to get pig brain on short notice

32:41.784 --> 32:44.786
than a human specimen.

32:51.561 --> 32:54.813
Is that from the--
the log book at St. Claire's?

32:54.898 --> 32:57.099
Just
the relevant page.

32:57.150 --> 33:00.269
First tried scraping it, hoping
Belly left some DNA behind,

33:00.320 --> 33:01.820
but he was too clever
for that.

33:01.905 --> 33:05.107
Or maybe he was never there
in the first place.

33:05.158 --> 33:06.775
I know none of you
believe me,

33:06.826 --> 33:10.162
which is why I have conducted
this little experiment.

33:10.246 --> 33:11.747
The pig brain
is activating

33:11.814 --> 33:13.815
a little-known side effect
of Cortexiphan,

33:13.867 --> 33:15.817
which is temporary
tissue regeneration.

33:15.869 --> 33:18.454
<i>Heated between</i>
<i>90 and 100 degrees,</i>

33:18.505 --> 33:21.156
the Cortexiphan I have
added to the pig brain

33:21.207 --> 33:24.960
should cause at least
partial regeneration

33:25.011 --> 33:27.429
of all biological matter
on the sheet of paper,

33:27.497 --> 33:32.184
<i>and voila,</i>
<i>fingerprints!</i>

33:32.268 --> 33:34.336
Although...

33:34.387 --> 33:37.172
identifying Belly's prints
from these smudges

33:37.223 --> 33:39.007
<i>may prove impossible,</i>
<i>after all.</i>

33:39.058 --> 33:42.060
What is
that brown mark?

33:43.947 --> 33:46.532
I don't know.

33:46.616 --> 33:49.785
Walter.

33:49.853 --> 33:54.456
As I said,
Cortexiphan is regenerative.

33:54.524 --> 33:56.158
You shouldn't
eat it, though.

34:03.967 --> 34:05.968
<i>Almond oil.</i>

34:06.035 --> 34:07.970
I knew it!
Chilean almonds!

34:08.036 --> 34:09.704
Almonds?

34:09.755 --> 34:11.806
Belly was obsessed
with them.

34:11.873 --> 34:13.542
Even had an agreement
with the importers.

34:13.592 --> 34:15.761
They sold them to him
wholesale.

34:17.981 --> 34:20.983
Must've had the oil
on his fingertips.

34:26.406 --> 34:29.190
Walter,
what are you doing?

34:29.242 --> 34:31.243
I'm going
to find Belly.

34:31.327 --> 34:35.164
A1 Imports,
down by the seaport.

34:35.231 --> 34:37.748
Walter, would you stop?
This is nuts.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.835
I am not crazy.

34:39.902 --> 34:42.371
At least I'll be able to confirm
that he's still alive.

34:42.422 --> 34:43.572
Would you excuse me?

34:43.623 --> 34:44.755
Oh.

34:44.841 --> 34:46.241
What about
Olivia and Peter?

34:46.292 --> 34:47.576
They're doing everything
they can.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.043
There's nothing we can do
to help them.

34:49.094 --> 34:51.179
What do you think
you're gonna find there?

34:51.246 --> 34:53.181
Walter.
Walter!

34:54.967 --> 34:56.935
I know this is
a wild goose chase,

34:57.020 --> 34:59.721
a fool's errand,
and I'm a fool,

34:59.772 --> 35:02.191
but no one is asking you
to join me, Alex.

35:02.258 --> 35:04.393
It's my hunch,
and I'm quite capable

35:04.444 --> 35:07.929
of pursuing it on my own,
so peace out.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.108
I don't--
drive.

35:20.159 --> 35:23.545
Alex?

35:23.613 --> 35:26.615
I was on a roll.
Mm-hmm.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.721
Got it.

35:32.789 --> 35:35.057
<i>You found the control panel?</i>

35:35.124 --> 35:36.975
Yeah.
<i>Now find the dial...</i>

35:37.060 --> 35:38.810
marked
"transmission amplitude."

35:38.895 --> 35:41.630
That's the one that needs
to be tuned all the way down.

35:43.966 --> 35:45.267
Okay, got it.

35:45.318 --> 35:46.635
<i>But not yet!</i>
<i>Not--not--not yet.</i>

35:46.686 --> 35:47.970
Sorry.

35:48.037 --> 35:49.438
We have to do it
together.

35:49.489 --> 35:50.822
If we don't, the beam
could go off-kilter,

35:50.907 --> 35:52.741
cut a swath
across Boston.

35:52.808 --> 35:54.476
It'd be sort of like
"don't cross the streams,"

35:54.527 --> 35:56.612
just, you know,
in reverse.

35:56.663 --> 35:59.164
You know I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:59.249 --> 36:02.000
Yes, I know.

36:02.085 --> 36:04.002
Okay,
tell me when.

36:04.087 --> 36:07.472
Okay, in three...

36:07.540 --> 36:08.957
two...

36:09.008 --> 36:10.342
one...

36:10.410 --> 36:11.760
Go.

36:27.277 --> 36:30.562
<i>We did it.</i>
<i>Good job.</i>

36:33.182 --> 36:35.233
Oh!

36:39.683 --> 36:40.967
Oh!

36:41.018 --> 36:42.835
Oh.

36:42.886 --> 36:44.520
Ooh!

36:47.391 --> 36:48.691
Jones!

36:48.775 --> 36:50.676
Oof.

36:52.029 --> 36:53.646
Ah! Ah!

37:00.070 --> 37:02.321
Oh!

37:02.372 --> 37:05.124
Hey! Security!
I--I'm FBI.

37:05.191 --> 37:06.692
Drop your weapon!
I--I can show you my badge.

37:06.743 --> 37:07.994
I said, drop it!

37:08.045 --> 37:10.046
Now!

37:13.917 --> 37:16.636
<i>How did you--?</i>

37:32.886 --> 37:34.320
Oh!
Aah!

37:35.939 --> 37:39.692
Aah! Aah!

37:43.997 --> 37:44.914
Ugh!

38:04.250 --> 38:06.552
<i>I got it wrong.</i>

38:06.603 --> 38:10.356
I was the sacrifice.

38:15.312 --> 38:18.263
I was the Bishop.

38:41.221 --> 38:42.621
<i>Ugh.</i>

38:42.673 --> 38:43.889
Tail fins?

38:43.957 --> 38:47.626
Yes. Tail fins,
whitewall tires,

38:47.678 --> 38:48.978
two-tone paint jobs.

38:49.062 --> 38:50.429
Oh, sure,
by today's standards

38:50.480 --> 38:51.964
they're terrible
for the environment,

38:52.015 --> 38:54.600
but, oh, there's something
to be said for style.

38:54.651 --> 38:56.068
<i>A1 Imports.</i>

38:56.136 --> 38:57.302
Come on, dear.

38:57.354 --> 38:58.971
Walter, they're probably
not even--

39:00.574 --> 39:03.809
Ye of little faith.

39:07.998 --> 39:09.665
It's just
as I remember it.

39:09.750 --> 39:12.084
I used to accompany Belly
here on his visits.

39:12.152 --> 39:13.753
Not a smell
you forget.

39:13.820 --> 39:15.654
- It smells like sweat.
- Exactly.

39:15.706 --> 39:17.322
<i>Hello?</i>

39:17.374 --> 39:20.426
<i>Hello, sir. My name</i>
<i>is Walter Bishop.</i>

39:20.493 --> 39:22.428
I'm sorry to trouble you
so late.

39:22.495 --> 39:25.965
I was hoping to speak
with Ms. Weisberg.

39:26.016 --> 39:27.166
I'm sorry, who?

39:27.217 --> 39:28.851
<i>Lynn Weisberg.</i>

39:28.935 --> 39:31.937
Uh, lovely woman,
yea high.

39:32.005 --> 39:33.472
Nice laugh.

39:33.523 --> 39:35.307
Walter, I don't think
he knows her.

39:35.359 --> 39:37.860
Hmm?
She's the owner.

39:37.944 --> 39:39.528
Or she was.
I--I--

39:39.613 --> 39:42.198
I was hoping to ask her
about a particular customer.

39:42.282 --> 39:43.816
Oh, I think I get it.

39:43.867 --> 39:46.285
You're talking about
that import/export company.

39:46.352 --> 39:48.687
Well, they went
out of business,

39:48.739 --> 39:49.872
<i>three years ago.</i>

39:49.956 --> 39:51.857
Oh, I see.

39:51.908 --> 39:53.709
<i>Tom, do you copy?</i>

39:53.794 --> 39:56.028
Yes, I'm here.
Coming right now.

39:56.079 --> 39:57.880
Look,
I have to go.

39:57.964 --> 39:59.999
Um, thanks
for your help.

40:00.050 --> 40:01.333
Sorry to have
bothered you.

40:01.385 --> 40:05.638
No bother.

40:05.705 --> 40:07.890
Maybe we should ask around.
Maybe someone else--

40:07.974 --> 40:11.143
- Walter, he had a gun.
- What?

40:11.211 --> 40:13.378
Well...

40:13.430 --> 40:15.064
It's a dangerous
neighborhood.

40:15.148 --> 40:17.382
Whatever the reason,
there are no almonds here.

40:18.435 --> 40:19.735
Did you hear that?

40:19.820 --> 40:22.888
Yes.

40:22.939 --> 40:24.857
- <i>Walter!
- Come on. Come on.</i>

40:24.908 --> 40:28.077
Walter.

40:42.626 --> 40:46.245
What are those?

40:46.296 --> 40:49.932
One of them sounds
almost like a rhino,

40:50.016 --> 40:52.184
but more nasal.

41:00.093 --> 41:04.096
I'm sorry. We were leaving,
and then we heard a noise.

41:06.199 --> 41:07.867
Go and tell him
we have visitors.

41:07.934 --> 41:09.268
Sir, I'm with the FBI.
You're making a mis--

41:09.319 --> 41:12.037
Stop!

41:12.105 --> 41:16.275
<i>Hands where</i>
<i>I can see 'em.</i>

41:16.326 --> 41:20.379
Look, this is all just
a misunderstanding.

41:21.498 --> 41:22.447
Aah!

41:22.499 --> 41:25.551
Walter,
come on!

41:42.319 --> 41:43.602
Oh.

41:43.653 --> 41:44.970
Whoa! Oh!
Oh.

41:45.021 --> 41:47.940
Oh! Oh!
No!

41:47.991 --> 41:51.610
No!

41:55.081 --> 42:00.419
I'm not sure I ever thought
I would see you again.

42:03.340 --> 42:08.344
