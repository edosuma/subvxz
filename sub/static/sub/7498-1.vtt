01:32.259 --> 01:34.052
(HORNS HONKING)

01:38.057 --> 01:41.059
Okay. Say, Jones and Barry
are doing a show.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.478
That's great!
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.104
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.774
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.693
VOICES:
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.112
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.657
- Jones and Barry are doing a show.
- Testing, testing.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.534
Jones and Barry are doing a show.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.203
You're telling me?

02:00.914 --> 02:04.040
MAN: Well, of course, I'm not a lawyer.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.917
I'm in the Kiddie Kar business.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.211
I don't know much about contracts...

02:08.628 --> 02:12.048
but it looks good to me.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.761
DOT:
It's the biggest contract I ever signed.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.387
Thanks to you, Mr. Dillon.

02:18.639 --> 02:22.266
Aw, you could have your choice
of a dozen shows.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.310
A pretty girl like you.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.813
Not with this depression.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.148
If not for you and your Kiddie Kars...

02:29.358 --> 02:31.484
Oh, now, Miss Brock...

02:31.735 --> 02:33.361
Dorothy, I mean.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.322
You don't mind
my calling you Dorothy, do you?

02:37.407 --> 02:38.825
Why, of course not.

02:39.076 --> 02:42.495
Well, Dorothy,
I'd like to do something for you.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.206
You've done entirely
too much for me already...

02:45.415 --> 02:47.750
and I just can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.752
No, no. I mean...

02:50.462 --> 02:53.631
I mean, I'd like
to do something for you...

02:54.466 --> 02:56.259
if you'd do something for me.

03:00.013 --> 03:04.058
Why, Mr. Dillon, of course
I'd be very glad to...

03:04.309 --> 03:07.436
but what could I possibly do
for a big man like you?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.605
Call me Abner.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.164
When we got Dorothy Brock,
we got a great break.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.959
Abner Dillon guarantees
to finance anything she does.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.963
These days, stars like Dorothy Brock
are a dime a dozen.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.590
That's what we got you for.

03:35.841 --> 03:40.511
Julian Marsh, the greatest musical
comedy director in America today.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.513
What do you mean, today?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.098
All right, tomorrow too.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.642
Say, with your reputation...

03:46.894 --> 03:49.604
Did you ever try to cash
a reputation at a bank?

03:49.855 --> 03:51.564
I'm in this for one reason only:

03:51.773 --> 03:52.815
Money.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.692
JONES: Money? You?

03:54.943 --> 03:57.778
With all your hits,
you ought to be worth plenty.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.780
I ought to be, but I'm not.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.616
Did you ever hear of Wall Street?

04:03.493 --> 04:07.038
Excuse me, Mr. Marsh, there's
a phone call for you. A Dr. Chadwick.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.832
- I'll call him back.
- He says it's urgent.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.001
About your examination.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.630
Use our private phone, Julian.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.260
What is it, doc?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.263
You have?

04:24.556 --> 04:26.390
Good Lord, you're not a machine!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.935
That body of yours
will stand just so much.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.270
There's no other way.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.566
You're not just headed
for another nervous breakdown.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.819
Any undue strain on your part
might easily prove fatal.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.489
Sorry, doc, but I've got to risk it.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.740
Anything wrong?

04:42.991 --> 04:46.118
- You won't have another breakdown?
- The contract's signed.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.996
- That doesn't matter.
- That's all right. It holds.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.042
You'll get your Pretty Lady.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.212
You haven't got anything
to worry about.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.297
I'm not gonna let you down...

04:59.341 --> 05:01.384
because I can't afford to.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.971
I've given everything I've had
to that gulch down there.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.974
It paid me, sure,
in money I couldn't hang on to...

05:08.225 --> 05:10.810
fair-weather friends, women, headlines.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.647
Why, even the cops and the newsboys
recognize me on sight.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.400
"Marsh the Magnificent."
"Marsh the Slave Driver."

05:17.651 --> 05:20.278
Actors tell you how Marsh
drove them, bullied them...

05:20.529 --> 05:21.946
and tore it out of them.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.864
A few would tell you
how Marsh made them.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.117
They've all got something to show,
except Marsh.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.619
Well, this is my last shot.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.748
I'll make more actors, but this time
I'll sock my money away so hard...

05:32.958 --> 05:35.501
they'll have to blast
to find enough to buy a newspaper.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.004
That's why I'm going ahead
with Pretty Lady.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.588
Pretty Lady has to be a hit.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.966
It's my last show,
and it's got to be my best.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.719
You're counting on me.
I'm counting on Pretty Lady...

05:45.262 --> 05:47.763
because it's got to support me
for a long time.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.140
- BARRY: Wait!
- Remember...

05:49.349 --> 05:53.185
my contract makes me boss with
a capital B. What I say, goes.

05:53.395 --> 05:56.856
Now, make the chorus call
for 10:00 tomorrow.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.858
(DOOR CLOSES)

05:59.067 --> 06:01.736
He'll drive us crazy
before we get this show on.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.406
Yeah, but suppose that guy
should pass out on us?

06:05.657 --> 06:08.784
New York will see
its first triple funeral.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.219
Good morning.
Mr. Marsh will be here soon.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.180
Quiet now. Quiet, please!

06:29.389 --> 06:32.058
Quiet, everybody, quiet!
Hello, Jerry. How are you?

06:32.309 --> 06:33.392
Hello, Andy.

06:33.602 --> 06:36.062
It's too good to be true.
How's the turnout, Mac?

06:36.313 --> 06:39.857
About 50-50. Half are dumb
and the other half are dumber.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.903
WOMAN: Andy! Hello.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.784
He's so busy.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.454
- Lorraine has been hitting the bottle.
- The peroxide bottle.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.917
You wanna get me canned?
You're set, you're in. Now scram.

06:58.126 --> 07:02.546
Darling, you're just too sweet,
the way you keep spoiling me.

07:02.881 --> 07:03.839
I beg your pardon.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.175
It's okay. This is a two-way street.

07:06.385 --> 07:10.221
I beg your pardon.
But are you, by any chance, the?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.514
What is the word?

07:11.765 --> 07:13.307
The stage manager?

07:13.558 --> 07:16.685
Hey, Ann, come out from
under that accent. I see you.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.687
Lolly!

07:18.980 --> 07:19.939
Darling.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.733
You remember Ann Lowell?

07:22.984 --> 07:25.403
Not Anytime Annie?
Who could forget her?

07:25.654 --> 07:28.155
She only said no once,
when she didn't hear the question.

07:28.698 --> 07:29.865
LORRAINE: You been abroad?

07:34.788 --> 07:35.913
Andy?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.373
Where's Andy Lee?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.208
Yes, Mr. Marsh. Coming right up.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.129
- Good morning, Mr. Marsh.
- Good morning.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.713
- Line them up.
- Yes, sir.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.133
Okay, girls, line up. Come on.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.968
Quiet, now. Quiet!

07:49.261 --> 07:51.095
Come on, now. Quiet, girls.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.307
I want all the dancers to line up
and double-lined out front.

07:55.517 --> 07:59.645
Showgirls can double-line in back
of them and the boys in back of them.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.941
Don't spread out!
Come on, girls, hurry up.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.987
I really had a charming summer
in Deauville, dear.

08:08.238 --> 08:12.700
Yes, but don't you find Sir George
impossible at times?

08:12.951 --> 08:15.161
Get a load of "Minnie the Mountaineer."

08:15.454 --> 08:18.414
It must have been tough on your
mother, not having any children.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.957
That's telling them.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.629
Oh, dear.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.015
You looking for somebody,
or just shopping around?

08:37.308 --> 08:39.643
Where will I find
the gentleman in charge?

08:40.352 --> 08:42.188
First door to your left, dearie.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.648
- I know, but...
- Shh.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.277
- WOMAN 1: He's expecting you.
- WOMAN 2: But that's the...

08:48.487 --> 08:50.070
(LAUGHING)

08:52.115 --> 08:54.783
WOMAN 1: Our mistake. The other door.

08:57.496 --> 09:00.247
- Oh.
- BILLY: Hey, wait a minute.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.082
Hey, what's the idea?

09:02.292 --> 09:04.293
Oh, uh... They said...

09:04.544 --> 09:05.794
Weren't you expecting me?

09:06.046 --> 09:09.798
Well, not exactly,
but I'm afraid you'll do.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.343
Well, I don't understand.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.012
I don't either.
What are you looking for?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.722
Well, isn't this the...?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.683
Wait till I get my clothes on.
I'll show you where it is.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.061
It isn't an "it," it's a "he."

09:22.562 --> 09:25.314
Maybe I'm wrong about the whole thing.
Let's start over again.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.317
I'm Billy Lawler,
one of Broadway's better juveniles.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.819
Oh. I thought you were important.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.781
That's the way most people
feel about juveniles.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.659
Only most of them
aren't so frank about it.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.623
- You're new to show business?
- Oh, I've had experience.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.125
- How many shows?
- Why, any number of them.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.878
- Come on, now.
- To tell you the truth...

09:48.088 --> 09:49.088
I want the truth.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.590
This'll be my first, if they take me.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.885
If they take you? Say, you can't miss.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.387
I'll take you in myself.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.556
I'll steer you right up
to the stage director.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.349
Come on, let's go.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.980
A short order of ham, coming out.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.983
Not good, but loud.
Honey, take a good look at them now.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.319
Because after they make that back line,
you won't see them again.

10:12.571 --> 10:17.116
If it isn't Little Lord Fauntleroy
and the village maiden.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.618
Just a minute.
Where are you headed, sister?

10:19.869 --> 10:23.122
- She wants to see Marsh.
- That'll make Marsh's day perfect.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.665
Come on, girls, inside.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.376
There's the boss right there.
His name is Julian Marsh.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.797
He's the fellow with the light green
felt hat. Go over and talk to him.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.265
WOMAN: Quit shoving.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.608
Lift the skirts up a little higher.
Come on, come on.

10:51.693 --> 10:52.943
Afraid I got a run.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.196
- First door to your left.
- In my stocking.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.532
First offense?

10:58.783 --> 11:01.201
Yes, but I don't think
I ought to tell them that.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.705
No, of course not.
And they'll never guess.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.624
Do you think I'll do?

11:06.875 --> 11:10.169
I only know what I read in the papers,
but you look all right to me.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.921
- Andy! Get the first eight girls.
- Yes, sir.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.341
Will the first eight girls line up here?

11:15.634 --> 11:19.053
The first eight girls line up
down in front. Come on.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.681
Now lift your dresses up.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.559
MARSH: Come on, higher.
I want to see the legs.

11:27.354 --> 11:31.190
Yeah, they got pretty faces too.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.068
ANDY:
Turn around. Come on, turn around!

11:35.278 --> 11:38.781
Oh, dear, not a calf in a carload.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.075
- Get the next eight.
- Next eight, come on.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.620
Stick with us,
and you'll come in on the tide.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.747
- ANDY: Hurry up, hurry up.
- MAC: Line up, girls.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.584
ANDY:
Hurry up, girls. Lift your dresses up.

11:51.002 --> 11:54.129
- Do you mind holding Fifi for me?
- MARSH: Turn around now, please.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.882
All right, back.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.803
Three!

12:02.430 --> 12:06.392
Okay those three on the left.
If I were you, I'd keep them.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.311
I suppose if I don't, you'll have to.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.106
Lorraine again, huh?

12:12.774 --> 12:15.234
Andy, you're a panic.
All right, have it your way.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.779
Mac, okay by special request
of the copyright owner.

12:19.531 --> 12:22.491
- ANDY: All right, next eight. Hurry up.
- Next eight girls.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.119
What's yours?

12:25.328 --> 12:29.456
Diane Lorrimer. 333 Park Avenue.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.875
And is her homework tough!

12:32.669 --> 12:33.669
Next.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.255
- ANDY: Adams!
- WOMAN 1: Here.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.507
- ANDY: Kipling!
- WOMAN 2: Here.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.926
- MARSH: Andy.
- What's the matter?

12:41.386 --> 12:44.722
Well, what is it, what is it?
What's the matter now?

12:44.931 --> 12:48.267
Must have been a slip-up someplace.
We're a girl short.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.603
Well, that's great. Just great!

12:51.813 --> 12:55.441
We also need a dance director who can
count to 40 without a pad and pencil.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.277
- Mr. Marsh...
- Well, do something! Get another girl.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.446
Are you gonna stand there
and shake a blond out your pantlegs?

13:00.655 --> 13:01.739
Yeah, but Mr. Marsh...

13:01.948 --> 13:04.324
- I don't want to butt in...
- A lot of people are like that.

13:04.534 --> 13:08.495
- ANDY: I'll have one here in the morning.
- That's ducky. I can hardly wait.

13:08.747 --> 13:12.791
Mr. Marsh, you don't have to wait.
And she's a swell dancer too.

13:13.001 --> 13:16.170
You picked her, but she got
eliminated the third time through.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.549
- Come out from behind there.
- You, with the legs! Come out of there.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.050
(LAUGHING)

13:22.260 --> 13:23.302
Quiet! Quiet, please!

13:23.511 --> 13:26.764
- Quiet, please!
- Quiet, please!

13:29.726 --> 13:32.686
Well, I'm a... Hey, kid! Hey, you!

13:33.229 --> 13:34.813
Hey, come on, get up.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.235
- The boss wants to see you again.
- Who? Me?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.070
Come on, come on.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.369
All right, she'll do.
They're all yours, Andy.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.372
ANDY: All right, get in line.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.754
All right, now, everybody.
Quiet, and listen to me.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.508
Tomorrow morning,
we're gonna start a show.

14:02.759 --> 14:06.637
We'll rehearse for five weeks,
and we'll open on scheduled time...

14:06.888 --> 14:08.514
and I mean, scheduled time.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.141
You'll work and sweat
and work some more.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.976
You'll work days and nights...

14:13.228 --> 14:16.355
and you'll work between time,
when I think you need it.

14:16.564 --> 14:20.859
You'll dance until your feet fall off
and you can't stand up...

14:21.110 --> 14:24.655
but five weeks from now,
we're going to have a show.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.575
Some of you have been with me before.
You know it'll be tough.

14:28.785 --> 14:32.120
It'll be the toughest five weeks
that you ever lived through.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.914
Do you all get that?

14:35.124 --> 14:38.544
Anybody who doesn't think he'll like it,
better quit right now.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.128
What do I hear?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.047
Nobody?

14:42.674 --> 14:44.675
Good. Then that's settled.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.177
We start tomorrow morning.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.015
All right, 10:00 tomorrow morning,
we start with the lyrics.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.475
In practice clothes.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.894
(CHATTERING)

15:00.942 --> 15:03.777
(SINGING "IT MUST BE JUNE")

15:26.217 --> 15:29.219
What did I tell him?
This is what I told him:

15:29.470 --> 15:32.806
"No, I won't run your stage
for that money."

15:33.057 --> 15:35.767
Great. You beat Jerry
to the finish by two lengths.

15:35.977 --> 15:39.521
All right, take your positions.
We'll try those routines again.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.985
Quiet! Where do you
think you are, home?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.572
I get back to New York
and I get this wire.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.199
Come on, kids, make it snappy.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.202
All right, Jerry, let's go!

15:54.412 --> 15:56.038
(PIANO PLAYING)

15:58.917 --> 16:00.459
MARSH: Dorothy, that's your cue.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.753
Things can never be the same now.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.088
I beg your pardon,
but would you mind saying:

16:05.381 --> 16:07.883
"Things can never be the same now"?

16:08.092 --> 16:09.927
- That's what I said.
- You did not.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.929
You said, "Things can
never be the same now."

16:12.138 --> 16:13.138
- I did not.
- You did.

16:13.389 --> 16:16.642
- Who's directing this show?
- She's reading my lines wrong.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.226
- I am not.
- What did you say?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.646
I said, "Things can
never be the same now."

16:20.897 --> 16:22.147
That's right.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.274
Things can never be the same now.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.361
MARSH: The scene ends with you on
the steps, and you go into the number.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.613
That's where you take his hand.

16:29.948 --> 16:33.450
The scene ends with you two
on the steps, and we go into the duet.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.499
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.919
- You're doing fine for a beginner.
- Well, thanks. I'm trying.

16:44.212 --> 16:48.090
I was so scared that first day,
I walked around the block four times...

16:48.299 --> 16:51.468
before I had the courage to even
come and apply for this job.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.136
It's tough, but you'll get along.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.473
Well, I wouldn't mind, if I could
only get that routine set.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.017
I'll show you those taps.
Come on with me.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.268
Taps?

17:00.478 --> 17:03.188
Say, I can do a tap dance on my ear.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.482
What bothers me is that routine.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.652
Then I'm just what
the doctor ordered. Come along.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.365
Now, look.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.825
Cross over.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.118
(HUMMING)

17:19.539 --> 17:21.289
You're gluttons for punishment.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.916
Well, Mr...
Well, this boy's showing me.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.795
- I was trying to make her...
- Trying to make her is right.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.175
We'll just let that pass.
Now try it again.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.969
(HUMMING)

17:35.888 --> 17:39.182
(SINGING "IT MUST BE JUNE")

17:57.952 --> 18:02.080
- Where you sitting?
- On a flagpole, dearie. On a flagpole.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.552
I always said she was a nice girl.
She's so good to her mother.

18:15.803 --> 18:19.598
She sure is. She makes $45 a week
and sends her mother 100 of it.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.492
Get some feeling into it, will you?

18:38.701 --> 18:41.328
What do you want me to do,
bite my nails?

18:50.922 --> 18:52.547
You've got the busiest hands.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.650
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

19:11.943 --> 19:13.151
It's out.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.487
That'll be enough of that. It smells.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.114
You don't like this number?

19:17.365 --> 19:20.075
Sure, I like it.
I've liked it since 1905.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.910
You think this is a revival?

19:22.161 --> 19:25.288
- It's out. The whole number!
- This number will be a riot.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.333
That's what I'm afraid of.
Dismiss. An hour for lunch.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.128
All right, everybody.
One hour for lunch.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.619
Waiting long, darling?

20:04.829 --> 20:06.746
Well, long enough.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.957
My, but we're grouchy, aren't we?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.793
- Oh, no, not that, but...
- What?

20:12.003 --> 20:14.671
I'm getting tired of
this hiding in doorways...

20:14.922 --> 20:17.799
sneaking in and out of places
and keeping under cover.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.302
Why, I'm beginning
to feel like a criminal.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.848
There's nothing criminal
in that, is there?

20:25.057 --> 20:27.517
No, there's nothing criminal in that.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.485
JONES: I thought we'd better tell you,
it looks like we're in trouble.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.279
MARSH: That word has a familiar sound.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.281
Are you married too?

20:41.532 --> 20:42.949
This is serious, Julian.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.785
Serious? Did you ever
leave your wife...

20:45.995 --> 20:49.164
sitting alone in a nightclub,
holding the check?

20:49.373 --> 20:52.375
You know Abner Dillon's
putting up the bankroll for our show.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.920
I knew he wasn't here
because you liked his face.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.631
I don't like his face
or any part of him.

20:57.882 --> 21:02.552
He looks like a Bulgarian boll weevil
mourning its first-born.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.222
Well, his interest in our show
is Dorothy Brock.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.724
And his interest is our principal.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.435
Very good. Very, very good.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.687
Even I was able to gather that much.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.941
Yes? Well, we stand a first-rate
chance of having him...

21:16.192 --> 21:19.569
withdraw his financial support.
Now, did you gather that?

21:19.779 --> 21:20.862
But why?

21:21.072 --> 21:24.532
Because dear Miss Brock is two-timing
Abner right under his very nose.

21:24.742 --> 21:25.992
Who with?

21:26.244 --> 21:28.870
With a fellow who used
to be her partner in vaudeville.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.206
She's come up in the business,
he hangs around.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.792
He's been out of town
and just got back last week.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.545
If Dillon finds out... And if he doesn't,
he's dumber than I thought...

21:37.755 --> 21:41.216
Well, now, wait.
Nobody could be as dumb as all that.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.761
He'll just walk out on us
and we'll be sunk, that's what...

21:44.971 --> 21:46.638
if we don't do something.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.556
Tried applying dough to the problem?

21:48.808 --> 21:51.476
Give the Romeo 100 bucks.
Get him out of the way.

21:51.686 --> 21:54.354
We might try using a little flint.

21:54.605 --> 21:57.899
You don't know this guy Denning.
That's his name. Pat Denning.

21:58.192 --> 22:01.486
He's not the kind of guy that
gets sent places just like that.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.530
Oh, no, he gets train-sick.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.324
Oh, I see. Hard-boiled, huh?

22:06.575 --> 22:09.577
Well, it's going to be just too bad...

22:09.829 --> 22:13.206
- ...but nobody's gonna ruin my show.
- What'll you do?

22:13.457 --> 22:16.710
I'll talk it over with Murphy,
a friend of mine from downtown.

22:16.919 --> 22:17.919
- Slim Murphy?
- Yeah.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.421
Murphy will kill him.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.589
That'll teach him a good lesson.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.384
I don't want to be mixed up
with Murphy or any other gangsters.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.304
No? One man's meat
is another man's Murphy.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.597
I told you what this show means to me.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.599
Well, this is what it does mean.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.060
Hello, Murphy? This is Julian Marsh.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.521
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Listen to me.

22:36.731 --> 22:39.858
You gotta do me a favor.
Did you ever hear of Dorothy Brock?

22:40.443 --> 22:43.278
Good, that makes it so much easier.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.238
Well, listen to me and get this.

22:45.448 --> 22:48.742
It seems there's a certain guy
by the name of Denning.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.828
D-E-N...

22:52.163 --> 22:55.623
N-I-N-G.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.668
I got you, Mr. Marsh. Sure.

22:59.170 --> 23:02.922
Hey, pipe down!
What do you think I got on, earphones?

23:04.258 --> 23:06.176
It's as good as done.

23:06.427 --> 23:10.347
Say, you ain't gonna forget me
on ducats for the new show, are you?

23:10.556 --> 23:13.350
Thattaboy! Okay.

23:21.192 --> 23:25.153
Not another nickel, honey.
Just can't be done anymore, that's all.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.822
Pat, don't be silly.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.658
We've always shared
and shared alike, haven't we?

23:30.951 --> 23:32.160
What's come over you?

23:32.453 --> 23:34.996
Getting a sudden attack
of manhood, possibly.

23:35.206 --> 23:39.125
Let's quit kidding ourselves.
I'm a regular anchor around your neck.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.377
- You're not.
- I am.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.670
Besides, never being able to see you...

23:42.880 --> 23:45.590
except when nobody's looking
is getting me down.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.052
But, darling,
I owe everything I am to you.

23:49.303 --> 23:52.263
It was you and that act of ours
that started me in all this.

23:52.515 --> 23:56.101
Why, you trained me and coached me
and taught me all I know.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.019
I was pretty dumb too.

23:58.312 --> 23:59.938
- I haven't forgotten.
- The act?

24:00.189 --> 24:02.107
It was grand, Pat. Really grand.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.442
- It was terrible.
- You didn't think so then.

24:04.693 --> 24:08.321
You mean I didn't say so then.
Oh, Dot, you've gone ahead.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.991
You've earned it. I've stayed
behind where I belong, I guess.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.701
You've kept yourself behind.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.414
Nothing of the sort. They wanted you.
They never wanted me.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.627
Besides, I've been getting myself
some education...

24:22.878 --> 24:25.755
and they have a name
for a man who doesn't work...

24:26.006 --> 24:28.258
who accepts money from a woman.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.760
It isn't a very nice name.

24:31.011 --> 24:34.305
- Darling, you're talking like a child.
- No, I'm not.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.808
- There isn't any other reason, is there?
- No.

24:37.059 --> 24:39.477
- Sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.188
It's late. I'll take you home.
Keep the change.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.982
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

24:44.233 --> 24:48.361
- I wish you didn't feel that way.
- So do I, but I do.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.992
(PIANO PLAYING)

24:57.621 --> 25:00.081
Watch your tempo! Watch it, will you?

25:00.291 --> 25:02.167
Get your feet off the floor.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.256
Faster, faster!

25:08.466 --> 25:10.717
Come on, faster! Faster!

25:12.428 --> 25:14.512
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

25:14.763 --> 25:16.139
It's brutal!

25:16.891 --> 25:18.600
Oh!

25:18.934 --> 25:23.480
May I remind you that Pretty Lady's
out-of-town opening is not far away?

25:23.814 --> 25:27.775
It's been advertised as
a musical comedy with dancing!

25:28.652 --> 25:32.280
If it isn't asking too much,
will you please show me a little?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.866
All right, once again.
Give it something!

25:35.117 --> 25:38.203
Come on. Ready, Jerry?
Get into it now. Come on!

25:38.412 --> 25:40.497
(PIANO PLAYING)

25:58.849 --> 26:00.266
Having fun?

26:01.101 --> 26:03.394
After three weeks,
a leg ain't nothing to me...

26:03.604 --> 26:05.522
but something to stand on.

26:06.106 --> 26:08.024
MARSH:
Let me hear your number, Dorothy.

26:08.275 --> 26:11.027
Come on, Jerry. The "Habit" number.

(DOROTHY HUMS)

26:13.489 --> 26:15.448

26:16.158 --> 26:19.160
(SINGING "YOU'RE GETTING
TO BE A HABIT WITH ME")

26:24.333 --> 26:26.501
Doesn't she sing gorgeous?

26:26.752 --> 26:29.254
Seventy thousand bucks.

26:50.651 --> 26:53.486
Watch this, honey.
I may want you to understudy her.

27:16.385 --> 27:17.427
All right, okay.

27:17.678 --> 27:20.597
Come on, folks, get ready for
the duet number. Start up.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.142
Okay, Jerry, let's go.

27:28.022 --> 27:29.897
Come on, faster!

27:49.501 --> 27:51.753
Faster, Jerry, faster!

27:53.047 --> 27:54.881
What's the matter with you?

27:56.216 --> 27:58.885
- You all right, kid?
- I guess so.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.721
ANDY: Come on, faster. Faster!

28:05.184 --> 28:06.309
WOMAN: Peggy!

28:07.227 --> 28:10.521
- ANDY: Stand back! Get back in line.
- LORRAINE: She's fainted.

28:10.731 --> 28:13.691
Come on now, places.
This is a rehearsal, not a rest cue.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.903
Mac, take her outside. Hurry up.
Come on, everybody.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.198
ANDY: All right, come on,
get back. Jerry, let's go.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.204
Come on, pick it up!

28:29.041 --> 28:30.833
- Here, sir.
- Thank you.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.215
- ANDY: Hold your places!
- Lawler, inside.

28:37.841 --> 28:40.677
- The girl's okay.
- LAWLER: You feel better, honey?

28:53.273 --> 28:54.899
I guess I fainted.

28:55.109 --> 28:56.651
That's a good guess.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.195
Well, I guess I'm all right now.

29:01.740 --> 29:07.203
Woo. Bad guess. Better sit down
again. Now listen, you let me play now.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.330
What would you suggest, doctor?

29:09.540 --> 29:11.666
A little fresh air and conversation.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.334
What about Mr. Marsh?

29:13.585 --> 29:16.838
Never mind Mr. Marsh.
Let's sit this dance out.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.381
And if I lose my job?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.718
If you do, there just
won't be any show.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.553
Anyway, it's a nice idea.

29:23.846 --> 29:27.974
I've got a lot of nice ideas.
What I need are ears to spill them in.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.893
Well, won't mine do?

29:31.186 --> 29:34.439
Yes, you know, I think
they'd do very, very nicely.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.315
When are your ears available?

29:36.567 --> 29:40.486
At all sorts of odd hours.
You must look them up sometime.

29:40.738 --> 29:42.447
Remind me to tell you you're swell.

29:43.157 --> 29:46.701
- MARSH: That's all for tonight.
- ANDY: All right, dismissed, girls.

29:52.207 --> 29:55.293
Well, thanks, doctor.
Your prescription was great.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.920
Now for the workshop.

29:59.590 --> 30:02.592
You gotta take it daily
to really do any good.

30:02.885 --> 30:05.094
It'll have to be
absent treatment, I'm afraid.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.346
At least for the time being.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.932
- PAT: Good night.
- Bye.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.353
- Good night, Jimmy.
- JIMMY: Good night.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.606
Coming, Abner?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.694
Dorothy, where will we eat?

30:21.945 --> 30:24.572
You know, Abner, I'm not a bit hungry.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.533
- But I'm all dressed for dinner.
- Oh, yes, so you are.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.368
I'll get the car.

30:31.789 --> 30:35.124
- Dorothy, the car's here.
- Yes, Abner.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.523
Why, doctor, you must like it here.

30:58.774 --> 31:01.359
I'm beginning to.
I'm not the doctor anymore, you are.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.737
I've become the patient,
and I'd like a little advice.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.365
Very well, but you might tell
the doctor your name.

31:07.574 --> 31:11.035
I couldn't do that,
but my initials are Pat Denning.

31:11.245 --> 31:15.122
What do you advise for a man
who's both hungry and lonesome?

31:15.374 --> 31:16.666
- Company.
- Excellent.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.501
Did you have anyone in mind?

31:18.794 --> 31:20.419
- Did you?
- Will you?

31:20.671 --> 31:24.257
- I'm very much afraid I will.
- Good.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.177
Good night, Pat.
It was a wonderful evening.

31:28.428 --> 31:29.929
- I'll see you again?
- I hope so.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.889
- Good.
- Good night.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.226
MURPHY: Hey, got a match?

31:35.435 --> 31:37.144
Yep. I guess so.

31:37.646 --> 31:40.022
Happen to know a guy named Pat Denning?

31:40.274 --> 31:42.233
- Why, yes.
- We've got a message for him.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.862
This guy Denning's a pretty wise mug,
but he ain't wise enough.

31:46.113 --> 31:49.240
If he don't lay off Dorothy Brock,
it'll be just too bad...

31:49.491 --> 31:51.075
for Denning. Get me?

31:51.285 --> 31:52.994
- I'll tell him.
- Yeah, well...

31:53.328 --> 31:54.328
Oh!

31:54.580 --> 31:58.291
- That's so you don't forget.
- Pat! Pat!

31:59.668 --> 32:02.128
Pat. Who were they?

32:02.379 --> 32:04.672
- Friends with good advice.
- Are you hurt?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.507
Not much.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.428
But, Pat, tell me what happened.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.221
Better let it drop.

32:12.472 --> 32:16.058
Besides, it's hardly a bedtime
story for a nice girl like you.

32:16.727 --> 32:19.645
What do you think this is?
Get that man out of here!

32:19.897 --> 32:21.689
- But, Mrs. Holt...
- But nothing!

32:21.899 --> 32:22.940
I have eyes.

32:23.150 --> 32:27.028
Just because there's a depression on,
some folks think I'll stand for it.

32:27.237 --> 32:28.362
But you don't know.

32:28.864 --> 32:32.783
After running a rooming house for 19
years, there's nothing I don't know.

32:33.035 --> 32:35.328
Now you get out, and no more talk!

32:35.579 --> 32:37.121
Then if he goes, I go too!

32:37.915 --> 32:40.583
Probably I'll be able to bear
up under that blow too.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.503
Well...

32:44.713 --> 32:46.589
where do we go from here?

32:47.382 --> 32:49.759
- Hotel?
- I suppose so.

32:50.010 --> 32:54.221
But it'll have to be inexpensive,
as I only have a dollar and a half.

32:56.141 --> 32:59.226
- Uh, what about my place?
- Broke?

32:59.519 --> 33:02.146
Not exactly. Not exactly flush either.

33:02.856 --> 33:05.733
Then I guess it's your place
or a park bench.

33:17.663 --> 33:18.829
Here you are.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.050
That's better.

33:32.469 --> 33:33.719
Hand me your coat.

33:46.066 --> 33:47.692
Make yourself comfortable.

33:49.111 --> 33:50.945
Will you excuse me a minute?

34:19.391 --> 34:22.560
Rose-colored glasses.
Let's see how the world looks.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.187
- Okay, doctor.
- Here we go.

34:32.237 --> 34:35.447
- Things beginning to look any better?
- A little bit.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.493
- Tired, aren't you?
- Dead tired.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.422
And I feel just like beginning.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.925
You hop, step and jump
as many miles as I have today...

34:55.177 --> 34:58.220
and you'd be tired too.

35:15.906 --> 35:19.867
Pat. Pat, what are you doing?
Please put me down!

35:20.077 --> 35:23.287
Please, Pat. Please put me down.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.709
Now you go right to sleep, youngster.

35:28.919 --> 35:31.253
What you need is a good night's rest.

35:32.714 --> 35:33.714
Good night.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.013
- Oh, Pat.
- Yes?

35:41.306 --> 35:43.390
Will you hand me my bag, please?

35:43.600 --> 35:46.185
- Oh, which one?
- That one.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.067
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.861
- Good night.
- Good night.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.373
(PIANO PLAYING)

36:16.174 --> 36:18.801
What do you do when you've
got left feet like mine?

36:21.721 --> 36:25.182
- Just pick them up and lay them down.
- I'm doing the best I can.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.521
Get a load of the juvenile.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.191
Didn't know we had
elephants in the show.

36:36.987 --> 36:38.612
MARSH: Wait a minute, hold it!

36:39.781 --> 36:40.823
Hold it, Jerry!

36:43.493 --> 36:47.746
Some director's gonna jail you for
taking money under false pretenses.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.582
You're supposed to be a dancer!

36:49.875 --> 36:52.626
You just need license plates
to look like a Model T Ford.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.795
They've been going all night long...

36:55.005 --> 36:58.632
I'll keep them here if it takes a week!
All right, get out!

36:58.884 --> 37:01.135
- Take the last eight bars.
- Pick it up, Jerry.

37:01.386 --> 37:02.553
Pick it up, Jerry.

37:13.273 --> 37:14.940
(KNOCKING)

37:20.280 --> 37:23.490
- Hello, honey.
- Oh, Dot, how are you?

37:23.950 --> 37:26.493
Oh, tea for two.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.163
Uh, yeah. Friend of mine dropped in.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.958
- Love me?
- Mm-hm.

37:33.710 --> 37:34.919
I wonder.

37:35.295 --> 37:37.880
You're not going to get
serious on me, are you?

37:42.594 --> 37:44.553
- You leaving town?
- Yeah.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.388
Stock job in...

37:46.640 --> 37:48.015
Philadelphia.

37:48.225 --> 37:50.601
Oh, Pat, without telling me?

37:50.852 --> 37:53.187
Well, I thought it was the best way.

37:55.649 --> 37:56.941
Maybe you're right.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.403
- Sit down, dear. I want to talk to you.
- Mm-hm.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.328
I've done a lot of thinking
since the other night.

38:09.537 --> 38:13.499
Pat, you know what's wrong
with me, or rather, with us?

38:14.042 --> 38:16.085
We've grown too necessary
to one another.

38:16.336 --> 38:20.047
You've been content in the shadows
while I basked in the spotlight...

38:20.257 --> 38:22.383
simply because it's held us together.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.678
- My success has been your failure.
- Well, dear...

38:25.971 --> 38:28.430
my failure, as you put it,
has been my happiness.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.309
But, darling, you're capable
of such great things.

38:32.686 --> 38:34.061
You're not a quitter.

38:34.354 --> 38:37.356
I've only wanted to help,
but I've been hurting you instead.

38:37.607 --> 38:39.316
I realize that now.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.027
That's why I came here this morning.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.654
Pat.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.573
We're not going to see
each other for a long time.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.575
No more doorways.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.911
No more secret meetings.

38:51.121 --> 38:53.747
You're going out on your own
and make a success.

38:55.542 --> 38:58.210
You're right, Dot. But you know...

38:58.461 --> 39:01.922
somehow, I can't imagine
going on without you.

39:02.716 --> 39:04.341
Nor I without you...

39:04.801 --> 39:06.260
but it's got to be.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.888
Yes, Dot. It's got to be.

39:10.724 --> 39:13.267
And maybe, someday...

39:14.644 --> 39:16.020
someplace?

39:16.521 --> 39:17.521
Maybe.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.026
Bye, Pat.

39:25.238 --> 39:26.405
Oh, Dot...

39:31.619 --> 39:32.911
I love you.

39:33.830 --> 39:34.913
Me too.

Up.

40:01.107 --> 40:04.068
Up. Up.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.236
Up.

40:06.821 --> 40:10.324
- How are you, Bluebeard?
- Okay, just a touch of scarlet fever.

40:10.617 --> 40:14.411
Oh, that's fine. Maybe it'll
develop into something serious.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.499
(WHISTLING)

40:21.878 --> 40:23.504
The curtain's just come down!

40:23.755 --> 40:25.005
It's the end!

40:25.507 --> 40:27.674
Is this what you call a finale?

40:31.429 --> 40:33.847
What is this? Amateur night?

40:34.974 --> 40:39.728
Have we been rehearsing for
five weeks, or did I dream it?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.021
The show's ragged!

40:41.272 --> 40:45.025
- What do you mean, the show's ragged?
- The numbers are ragged!

40:45.276 --> 40:48.404
May I remind all you
shining lights that...

40:48.655 --> 40:52.324
this is the company
that opens tomorrow night?

40:52.867 --> 40:55.661
I am in the right theater, am I not?

40:55.912 --> 40:59.123
This is the Pretty Lady company,
isn't it?

40:59.416 --> 41:01.875
The all-star show that...

41:02.168 --> 41:04.461
opens in Philadelphia tomorrow night?

41:04.712 --> 41:07.047
- CROWD: Philadelphia?
- ANDY: Quiet.

41:07.757 --> 41:08.715
MAC: Quiet!

41:09.634 --> 41:11.969
Philadelphia, PA.

41:12.220 --> 41:15.431
Yeah, and on Sundays, it's P-U.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.182
- ANDY: Quiet!
- Quiet!

- I mean Philadelphia.

Full dress rehearsal, 4:00.
Arch Street Theater.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.696
But I don't want to go to Philadelphia.

41:31.739 --> 41:34.533
Who does? We couldn't get
the house at Atlantic City.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.702
But why Philadelphia?

41:36.953 --> 41:39.413
Well, when you become stage director...

41:39.622 --> 41:43.333
we'll open in your apartment.
But right now, it's Philadelphia.

41:45.044 --> 41:48.422
Of all the cities in the United States,
he would pick Philadelphia.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.424
ANDY: All right now, listen to me.

41:51.801 --> 41:54.553
We open at the Arch Street
Theater tomorrow night.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.976
So this is Philadelphia!

- Getting a kick out of it?
- Of course, you?

42:15.950 --> 42:19.495
I don't know. Do you suppose
anybody'll even know I'm in the show?

42:19.746 --> 42:20.746
I will.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.956
Does it make any difference to you?

42:23.208 --> 42:26.251
Gee, Billy. I've been for you
since that first day.

42:28.588 --> 42:29.796
- I'll be seeing you.
- Okay.

You won't forget the modulation
on the last eight bars.

I don't know. I think it'll do.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.960
But I want you to come back tomorrow...

45:55.211 --> 45:59.423
to give the best performance
that you ever gave in your lives.

46:00.133 --> 46:01.174
Company dismissed.

46:01.426 --> 46:03.385
- Dismissed, girls.
- Company dismissed!

46:03.636 --> 46:05.262
ANDY: Go on out and have a good time.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.724
You really was elegant, Miss Brock.

46:10.685 --> 46:12.602
Pansy, did anyone telephone me?

46:12.854 --> 46:13.895
Phone?

46:14.105 --> 46:16.189
No, ma'am. Nobody at all.

46:16.482 --> 46:20.193
- You're sure?
- I certainly is. Yes, ma'am, Miss Brock.

46:22.989 --> 46:26.491
- Have a little supper with me, huh?
- I would have.

46:26.701 --> 46:30.662
- But you thought of it too late.
- I've been thinking of it all day.

46:30.913 --> 46:34.166
Well, I'm not a mind reader.
I've got a date.

46:34.709 --> 46:35.959
- Billy.
- Huh?

46:36.169 --> 46:38.712
- I'm free tomorrow night.
- Then it's a date.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.922
- Okay.
- Don't forget, now.

46:42.508 --> 46:45.385
I gotta get the stuff for the party.
Do you mind?

46:45.636 --> 46:49.306
I'll see you at the hotel,
room 1061, and make it snappy!

46:51.017 --> 46:54.227
She says for you to wait.
She'll be out in just a minute.

46:54.437 --> 46:56.146
Oh.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.485
MAC: Good night, Mr. Marsh.

47:06.407 --> 47:08.617
I said, "What is it? A duck?"

47:08.826 --> 47:11.077
Andy, you're terrible.
You know any more?

47:11.287 --> 47:12.746
I've got a lot more...

47:13.623 --> 47:14.664
MARSH: Andy?

47:14.916 --> 47:18.084
- Yes, sir?
- Go on, yes man. Papa give you liver.

47:18.377 --> 47:20.212
Shut up. This may be important.

47:20.463 --> 47:24.049
Oh, it can't be, darling.
He's calling you.

47:41.818 --> 47:43.235
SPEAKS SILENTLY: Hurry up!

47:48.449 --> 47:50.033
Oh.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.160
Sit down, Andy.

47:59.627 --> 48:01.294
Anything wrong, chief?

48:04.340 --> 48:05.882
Everything's wrong, Andy.

48:06.843 --> 48:09.427
No, you're a great director, Mr. Marsh.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.061
Maybe I was, but...

48:18.896 --> 48:20.981
right now I'm a sick man.

48:21.232 --> 48:25.110
They told me I was sick when
I started, but I started anyway.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.864
Andy, I'm going to finish,
and I'm gonna have a show.

48:29.740 --> 48:32.617
I know what they'll say.
They'll like it. They've got to.

48:33.911 --> 48:36.913
"Marsh is a wizard.
He turns them out like clockwork.

48:37.164 --> 48:39.291
The guy isn't human. He's a machine."

48:40.334 --> 48:42.669
Well, I'm not a machine, Andy.

48:42.879 --> 48:46.840
And for the first time, I'm counting
on someone else. I've got to.

48:47.133 --> 48:51.720
I'm counting on you. And tomorrow
night, we're gonna give them a show.

48:52.513 --> 48:55.265
The greatest show
Julian Marsh ever put on.

48:56.434 --> 48:58.184
What are you doing? Got a date tonight?

48:58.394 --> 48:59.728
No.

49:03.482 --> 49:05.901
Come on home with me, will you?
I'm lonesome.

49:06.152 --> 49:07.903
Sure.

49:10.740 --> 49:11.740
Taxi.

49:11.949 --> 49:14.492
Pat! What are you doing
in Philadelphia?

49:14.744 --> 49:16.536
Got my passport and dropped over.

49:16.787 --> 49:19.623
- Business or pleasure?
- I don't know yet, but it's a job.

49:19.874 --> 49:24.210
Say, what about one of those cozy
midnight suppers one reads about?

49:24.420 --> 49:26.379
I've been hoping you'd come out.

49:26.631 --> 49:29.382
- Oh, dear, I have a date.
- Well, break it.

49:29.634 --> 49:32.427
- I'd like to, but I can't.
- Well, you can try.

49:32.678 --> 49:37.140
It's with the company and we open
tomorrow. I really should be on hand.

49:37.391 --> 49:40.602
I understand. Let me drive
you to the main event.

49:40.811 --> 49:41.937
All right.

49:42.229 --> 49:43.229
Taxi.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.362
Congress Hotel.

49:51.322 --> 49:53.073
Forget something, Dorothy?

49:55.409 --> 49:57.160
Oh, no.

50:00.122 --> 50:01.539
Congress Hotel.

50:03.417 --> 50:06.920
Oh, Abner. Isn't this car big
enough for two? Move over.

50:07.171 --> 50:09.255
You ain't gonna have
another spell, are you?

50:09.465 --> 50:12.717
I'm tired. Dress rehearsal is no picnic.

50:12.969 --> 50:15.804
- A little party'll do you good.
- Yes.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.973
Don't just being with me cheer you up?

50:18.182 --> 50:20.350
Oh, tremendously.

50:20.601 --> 50:23.520
I'm practically hysterical right now.

50:28.025 --> 50:30.944
Oh, don't be afraid of me.
I got strength.

50:31.237 --> 50:34.614
I used to be the intercollegiate
champion hop, skip and jumper.

50:34.865 --> 50:37.283
- Come on now, hurry up.
- Here I come.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.206
Give the little boy a big hand.

50:43.457 --> 50:46.042
Right across your big mouth.

50:46.752 --> 50:48.086
Please!

50:56.303 --> 50:59.806
I tell you, I don't even know
my own strength. Wait a minute.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.433
Just look here.

51:01.767 --> 51:03.977
Oh, you're too, too divine.

51:06.272 --> 51:10.525
Tomorrow you've got to give
a performance, not an exhibition.

51:12.069 --> 51:14.738
Well, you'd never know it
from the manuscript.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.698
I beg your pardon.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.158
She's right.

51:18.909 --> 51:20.785
- Let's dance.
- I don't want to.

51:21.037 --> 51:23.538
- Come on, I wanna dance.
- Stop mauling me.

51:23.789 --> 51:26.791
Let me alone.
You're not funny to me tonight.

51:27.001 --> 51:29.002
- I've got half a mind...
- You're telling me.

51:29.295 --> 51:31.171
Do you wanna cramp your act?

51:31.380 --> 51:36.134
In a star, it's temperament,
but in a chorus girl, it's just bad taste.

51:36.385 --> 51:39.512
What is this, target practice?
Why can't you let me alone?

51:39.764 --> 51:43.224
Wisecracks, I'm sick of them!
I'm tired of you.

51:43.476 --> 51:45.560
Tired of all of you, do you hear?

51:46.353 --> 51:47.979
Why, Dorothy.

51:48.189 --> 51:49.606
(DOOR SLAMS)

51:50.649 --> 51:54.861
You know, you better hop on your
Kiddie Kar and go back to Cleveland.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.322
Excuse me, it's the tight shoes.

51:57.698 --> 51:58.990
Shut up!

51:59.450 --> 52:01.910
- Where are you going?
- Maybe she needs me.

52:02.203 --> 52:06.456
- Are you going to be a sucker for that?
- Sucker! You listen to me.

52:06.707 --> 52:10.251
Seventy thousand dollars is a lot of
money to pay for a pack of insults.

52:10.503 --> 52:13.505
So you've been calling me
a sucker behind my back, eh?

52:13.756 --> 52:15.965
Well, I ain't a sucker for anybody.

52:16.217 --> 52:17.967
Dorothy don't mean that to me!

52:18.219 --> 52:21.429
If not for me, she wouldn't
have had a show to star in.

52:21.639 --> 52:24.265
She better not try to
give me the air now.

52:25.434 --> 52:26.976
Now...

52:27.561 --> 52:30.980
So that's it, is it?
You small-town big shot.

52:31.232 --> 52:32.565
- Now don't start...
- Shut up!

52:32.858 --> 52:34.818
So I better not give you the air, eh?

52:35.069 --> 52:37.612
Well, that's exactly what
I'm giving you right now.

52:37.905 --> 52:41.116
Now get out of my room, you sucker!
Get out!

52:41.367 --> 52:42.367
Try and make me!

52:42.576 --> 52:44.702
- Don't do that again!
- Get out!

52:46.413 --> 52:47.372
Get out!

52:50.960 --> 52:53.419
No place for anybody
whose insurance ain't paid.

52:53.921 --> 52:55.296

52:55.840 --> 52:59.634
And the next time you come to
a lady's apartment, act like a lady.

Hello.

- Hello, Dorothy.
- Hello, Pat...

53:34.253 --> 53:36.462
Pat, I can't stand it any longer.

53:37.882 --> 53:39.257
I've gotta see you.

53:39.508 --> 53:41.759
- Yes, but...
- Please don't ask me why.

53:42.011 --> 53:43.928
Just come quickly, please.

Come in.

54:15.669 --> 54:16.878
Sorry, Julian.

54:17.129 --> 54:18.504
More trouble.

54:19.340 --> 54:22.342
- What's up?
- Dorothy's out of the show.

54:22.551 --> 54:25.637
Definitely, once and for all, she's out.

54:27.640 --> 54:30.725
Well, let me have it. What happened?

54:30.976 --> 54:34.437
She threw me out of her room.
That's what.

54:34.647 --> 54:37.565
Now you want to throw her out.
What is this? A game?

54:37.816 --> 54:39.984
- You can't do it.
- ABNER: Oh, no?

54:40.194 --> 54:42.570
Brock's in my show and that's final.

54:42.863 --> 54:45.073
If Dorothy stays in...

54:45.366 --> 54:49.827
this show don't open
tomorrow night. That's final.

54:50.079 --> 54:51.996
Why, you potbellied sap.

54:52.206 --> 54:53.206
I resent that.

54:53.457 --> 54:56.334
You've sunk $70,000 already,
and you're gonna toss that away...

54:56.543 --> 54:58.336
because of a dame?

54:58.587 --> 55:00.296
That's my funeral, ain't it?

55:00.547 --> 55:05.176
And the funeral of 200 other people:
chorus girls, boys, electricians.

55:05.594 --> 55:07.720
You wouldn't be that mean, would you?

55:07.972 --> 55:10.932
Well, I think she ought to apologize.

55:11.141 --> 55:15.144
Why, of course she'll apologize.
She'll be sorry by morning.

55:16.355 --> 55:18.773
I wish you wouldn't take it like this.

55:19.024 --> 55:23.278
Back in New York, they're calling you
"The Angel of Broadway."

55:23.529 --> 55:24.570
No.

55:24.780 --> 55:26.531
- Sure.
- Are they?

55:27.157 --> 55:28.533
Well...

55:28.826 --> 55:32.787
I guess maybe I can overlook it,
if she apologizes.

55:37.584 --> 55:40.753
But it must be tonight.

55:41.088 --> 55:42.588
That's final.

You don't seem to be warming up at all.

Oh, don't, Terry! Please!

55:56.979 --> 55:59.522
Come on, this is no way to act.

55:59.773 --> 56:02.317
You've got me wrong, Terry.
I'm not acting.

be pawed, that's all.

and we can do it again. Let's get Marsh.

- Mr. Denning. Is he here?

to be trouble. I saw...

Oh! So it's "Pat" to him,
but it's "Mr. Denning" to me.

- I know what it's about!

- Spying? I wasn't spying...
- You were!

You were peeking through the keyhole.
You were, because I saw you.

- Wait for what?

59:53.882 --> 59:56.676
- Can't tell definitely.
- Maybe it's only a sprain.

59:56.927 --> 01:00:00.179
Looks like a fracture.
Can't tell till the x-rays are made.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.682
- Will she be able to go on tomorrow?
- DOCTOR: Go on?

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.393
- She's got the show tomorrow night!
- Not a chance.

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:07.687
She's got to! Do something, doctor!

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.772
Get her a pair of crutches.

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:11.983
- Oh...
- There, there.

01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:14.485
- Don't stand there gaping.
- But...

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:16.529
Oh, get out! Get out!

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:21.617
- I still don't know why you're here.
- If it was your business, I'd tell you.

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:24.537
A broken ankle, huh?

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.750
It's too bad it wasn't her neck.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:33.921
May I have your attention?

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.549
- Quiet, quiet!
- ANDY: Quiet, please!

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.760
There'll be no performance tonight.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.596
Wait a minute. Wait!

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:45.933
Our star, Miss Brock, has had
an accident. She's broken her ankle.

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:50.896
Don't leave the theater until
you're dismissed. Get that, Andy?

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:53.399
Hold the company here
for further instructions.

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:57.153
- Stick around, everybody.
- Don't anybody leave the theater!

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:02.533
You gotta think of something, someone.
There must be some way out of this.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:05.494
Dillon just phoned.
He's got everything fixed.

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:09.707
- Up to and including Brock's ankle.
- No, he's going through with it.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.626
He's going through with what?

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:15.880
He found someone to take Brock's place,
and he's on his way here with her now.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:17.089
- Where?
- I don't know.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.799
BARRY: Come on, Marsh.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:20.760
No such luck.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.186
Now, there's a Kiddie Kar
I could really go for.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:34.815
Anytime Annie. Well, lay me low.

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:40.112
Your new leading lady, folks. I guess
I saved the day all right this time.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.907
ANDY: We'd better go in
and talk it over with Marsh.

01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:49.664
- You have a big investment in this show.
- You're telling him?

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:52.416
I appreciate your help,
but she won't do.

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:55.711
Sure! She didn't wanna do it at first,
but I convinced her.

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:58.172
She's all set.
Why, she'll be sensational.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.591
- How about letting me talk?
- All right.

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:02.635
Let's quit kidding, Mr. Marsh.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:06.055
Abbie, all those things sounded swell
at breakfast...

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:08.140
but I can't carry this show.

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.101
I know that as well as you do.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:11.644
I appreciate your honesty.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:15.398
Swell, because you've got somebody
here who can carry your show.

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:17.108
A great little trouper.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.485
Aren't I capable
of selecting my own cast?

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.571
But you'd never pick her.
I say she can swing it.

01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:24.782
How can you lose? You gotta try her.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.450
- Who is she?
- Sawyer.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.453
- MARSH: Sawyer.
- Yes, Peggy Sawyer.

01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:32.623
She can dance rings around Brock.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.167
Your show's half dancing.
She'd kill them.

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:38.504
Nobody ever heard of her.
She's a raw kid from the chorus.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:42.007
Listen, I've been waiting years
for a chance like this...

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:46.011
and if I give it up to someone else,
believe me, she's gotta be good.

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:50.391
- Send her in.
- Do you mean it?

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.101
MARSH: Yes, send her in.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:54.854
BARRY: Mac!

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.105
- Oh, Mac!
- MAC: Here.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:57.606
- Andy!
- ANDY: Yes, sir.

01:02:57.816 --> 01:02:59.692
- Get Sawyer.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:04.613
- The boss wants to see you.
- PEGGY: Who, me?

01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:06.365
Not your brother. Come on.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:09.034
- Lorraine, will you hold that?
- Go ahead.

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:15.249
Well, here she is.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.132
Experience?

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:25.426
Just this show, Mr. Marsh.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:28.721
You know the songs and dances?
Can you play the lead tonight?

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:30.556
The lead?

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:34.477
Sure, you can. Don't let him scare you.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:43.360
I'll give you a chance
because I've got to.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:44.737
Andy, send Jerry in.

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:47.364
I'll have a live leading lady
or a dead chorus girl.

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:50.951
Get out of here. I don't want
anybody in for the next five hours.

01:03:51.203 --> 01:03:53.245
- Good luck, honey.
- Come on, you.

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:58.000
Pick it up right after the number.
There's your cue. Speak.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:02.338
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:04.924
No, it's impossible. Impossible.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:09.136
You're greeting the man you love.
Your entrance speech!

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:11.555
Make it mean something.
Put feeling into it!

01:04:11.807 --> 01:04:12.848
Listen, like this:

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:16.018
"Jim, they didn't tell me
you were here.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.604
It was grand of you to come."
Let me hear it.

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:23.192
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.
It was grand of you to come.

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:24.944
No, it won't do.

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:27.029
Look, have you ever been in love?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.282
Did you ever have a man hold you
in his arms and kiss you?

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:40.292
Now you're in the spirit of the thing.
You love this man.

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:42.837
Now, give it all you've got.
Let me hear it.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.882
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.134
It was grand of you to come.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:53.013
That's better.
Let me hear it from the beginning.

01:04:53.265 --> 01:04:55.307
Go over there
and make your entrance again.

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:56.642
All right.

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:59.728
Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.730
It was grand of you to come.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:07.611
(SINGING "42ND STREET")

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:22.835
I can't! I can't...

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:24.879
Look here.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.464
You can't, but you will.

01:05:27.716 --> 01:05:28.924
Please, Mr. Marsh.

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:31.093
You want this chance or don't you?

01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:34.054
- All right. Let's try it again.
- All right.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.642
(SINGING "42ND STREET")

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:00.497
All right, it's fair, only fair.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:01.916
(KNOCKING)

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.250
MARSH: Come in.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:05.711
Only an hour before the curtain.

01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:07.588
Okay, Jerry, that's all.

01:06:14.346 --> 01:06:16.722
You let me down, Sawyer, and I'll...

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.100
Come on, lie down and relax.

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:24.730
The wardrobe woman will have to
come in to fit your costumes.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:28.859
But rest all you can, because
you're definitely going on tonight.

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:35.240
Julian, how about it?

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:38.410
All right, the show goes on.
Wardrobe, everybody.

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.165
Everybody, makeup.

01:06:45.794 --> 01:06:47.753
- Oh, Billy.
- Hello.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.464
I brought some coffee.
You can use a little, huh?

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:54.093
Oh, Billy, I'm so excited,
I think maybe I'm dreaming.

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:57.388
Oh, no, you're awake, all right.
Don't worry about that.

01:06:57.681 --> 01:07:00.140
Billy, what's going to happen to me?

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:04.103
You'll be a hit. You'll be the
biggest thing that ever hit Broadway.

01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:05.521
Oh, I hope so.

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:07.022
Say, I know so.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.525
And I'm for you too. You know that.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:11.026
Even if...

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:12.861
Even if what?

01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:14.238
Oh, honey.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:18.575
I've been for you ever since the day
you walked in on me in my BVDs.

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:22.705
I wanted to tell you, ever since
I first saw you, how I feel about you.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.916
Oh, I don't know how to say it.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.877
But you know what I mean, don't you?

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:33.298
I guess it does sound kind of
funny at that, the way I say it.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:37.344
But the lines are new for me,
at least off-stage.

01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:41.473
Well, I guess maybe I can read
between the lines, Billy...

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.393
but I wanna hear you say some more.

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:57.489
Billy, it was grand of you to come.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:07.791
- They told me I'd find you here.
- Miss Brock!

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:11.003
You can't talk to her, nobody can.
It's Marsh's orders.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.629
I wanna see her alone.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:13.839
I know, but...

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:18.010
It's all right, Billy.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.197
So you're going to take my place.

01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:40.491
I'm sorry, Miss Brock.

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:43.118
You're nervous, aren't you?

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:46.997
Well, don't be.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.666
The customers out there
want to like you.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.376
Always remember that, kid.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.087
I've learned it from experience.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:56.381
And you've got so much to give them:

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:59.593
Youth and beauty and freshness.

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.011
Do you know your lines?

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.514
And your songs?

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:05.390
And your dance routine?

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.060
Well, you're a cinch.

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:16.401
But... But it's tough
on you, Miss Brock.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.072
Come here.

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:21.865
Peggy, isn't it?

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:26.245
You know, Peggy, when I started
for the theater tonight...

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.705
I wanted to tear your hair out.

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:30.832
And then I started thinking.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:33.627
Well, after all, I've had my chance.

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:35.546
And now it's your turn.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.256
I've had enough.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:41.801
For five years it's kept me away from
the only thing I ever wanted.

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.095
And a funny thing...

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:47.432
a broken ankle was the thing
that made me find it out.

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:53.939
You know, Peggy, most anyone can have
success with the proper breaks.

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:55.482
As for me...

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:59.111
I'll take Pat and vaudeville...

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:00.988
or whatever goes with him.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.491
We're being married tomorrow.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:06.618
Oh, I'm so glad.

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:07.828
(KNOCKING)

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.121
Come in.

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.623
You've gotta hurry, miss.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:14.626
Come right in, boys. Right over here.

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.438
MAC: Overture, places, girls!

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.406
I think it looks very nice now.

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:45.908
Do I look all right?

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.785
You look adorable.

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:54.166
Now, go out there and be so swell
that you'll make me hate you.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.459
PEGGY: Thanks.

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:58.921
Remember, girls, I want
a straight line all the way through.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:01.673
Marguerite, you're first.
Give me a big smile.

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:04.343
Get ready. All right, curtain.

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.362
Come on, all right. Get Sawyer.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:28.951
When she comes out, I don't want
any of you to say a word to her.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:31.370
Here she comes.

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:33.997
All right, break up.
Pay no attention to her.

01:11:38.253 --> 01:11:41.046
Sawyer, you listen to me,
and you listen hard.

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:42.965
Two hundred people, 200 jobs...

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:46.551
$200,000, five weeks of grind,
blood and sweat depend upon you.

The lives of these people
who've worked with you.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.348
You've got to go on
and give and give and give.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.850
They've got to like you, understand?

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:56.144
You can't fall down, because...

01:11:56.396 --> 01:11:59.314
your future, my future
and all we have is staked on you.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:00.649
Now I'm through.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.527
Keep your feet on the ground,
your head on your shoulders...

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:06.697
and go out. Sawyer,
you're going out a youngster...

01:12:06.948 --> 01:12:09.283
but you've got to come back a star.

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:12.119

Well, honey, we couldn't lose them,
and least of all, Jimmy.

01:12:21.421 --> 01:12:24.423
Why, Jim, they didn't tell me
you were here.

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:26.258
It was grand of you to come.

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:28.260

You got by, but you're not through yet.

The toughest part's coming.
Don't be a flash in the pan.

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:37.027
There isn't an actor here who doesn't
know what you're going through.

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:39.613
Now you gotta rest. Rest and relax.

01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:41.865

- Oh, no, I didn't.
- Well...
