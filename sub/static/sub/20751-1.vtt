presents

00:44.834 --> 00:49.334
AFTERIMAGE

00:51.792 --> 00:55.792
Starring

01:24.292 --> 01:26.417
Here comes our late Varsovian!

01:26.584 --> 01:29.001
Excuse me, where can I find
Professor Strzeminski?

01:29.584 --> 01:31.876
Professor Strzeminski...

01:33.376 --> 01:34.334
Ah... there!

01:37.876 --> 01:40.042
He's seen you, he'll be right here.

01:40.251 --> 01:42.084
But how will he get here?

01:42.251 --> 01:42.751
Like this!

01:51.876 --> 01:53.084
Madman!

02:01.417 --> 02:02.792
My god, are you alright?

02:04.959 --> 02:06.542
Aren't you going to help a cripple?

02:09.792 --> 02:11.209
I'm sorry. I...

02:12.542 --> 02:15.334
I am Wladyslaw Strzeminski
and I'm alright.

02:22.667 --> 02:26.167
Welcome to the Lodz School
of Fine Arts field trip.

02:26.459 --> 02:28.626
I've gone off the rails
because of you, sir.

02:29.167 --> 02:31.876
I know, Jadwiga, it's my fault.

02:34.251 --> 02:36.209
- What is your name?
- Hanna.

02:37.042 --> 02:38.209
Miss Hanna.

02:39.126 --> 02:44.709
The image has to be
what you absorb

02:45.542 --> 02:46.876
from this...

02:47.292 --> 02:48.709
from this.

02:50.542 --> 02:53.834
When we gaze at an object,
we get its reflection in our eye.

02:54.251 --> 02:56.709
When we stop looking at it

02:57.876 --> 02:59.959
and move our gaze elsewhere

03:00.126 --> 03:02.542
an afterimage of the object
remains in the eye.

03:02.792 --> 03:07.459
A trace of the object with
the same shape but the opposite colour.

03:08.084 --> 03:09.542
An afterimage.

03:09.751 --> 03:10.917
Afterimages...

03:11.084 --> 03:15.292
are the colours of the inside of the eye
which looks at an object.

03:15.959 --> 03:19.209
Because a person really only sees
what he is aware of.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.417
How did he lose his arm and leg?

03:34.209 --> 03:36.001
He's never told us,

03:37.292 --> 03:39.834
but it's better not to ask.

03:51.209 --> 03:55.167
December 1948

03:55.876 --> 04:01.959
<i>The first Congress of the 
Polish United Workers' Party has just closed.</i>

04:02.209 --> 04:05.792
<i>We shall implement 
the momentous resolutions of the Congress.</i>

04:06.084 --> 04:08.667
<i>We will fight for their realisation</i>

04:08.834 --> 04:12.626
<i>and mobilise the masses around them.</i>

04:13.251 --> 04:16.291
<i>Bringing Poland closer to socialism</i>

04:16.459 --> 04:20.166
<i>is the sacred duty of a Party member.</i>

04:29.292 --> 04:32.126
<i>Comrades, there's no doubt</i>

04:32.626 --> 04:37.167
<i>that to achieve the great tasks
set by the Congress</i>

04:37.667 --> 04:41.751
<i>we can unite
the broadest masses of the people.</i>

04:46.584 --> 04:48.376
<i>Long live the Polish nation.</i>

04:48.626 --> 04:52.167
<i>Long live its heroic working class.</i>

04:52.334 --> 04:56.167
<i>Long live the Polish United Workers' Party.</i>

05:07.709 --> 05:08.542
Look!

05:11.542 --> 05:13.001
Jesus Christ!

05:35.376 --> 05:36.126
What have you done?

05:36.376 --> 05:38.001
I live here, I'm a painter.

05:39.084 --> 05:40.084
You're coming with us.

05:44.167 --> 05:45.792
Stand up!

05:52.876 --> 05:53.867
<i>Name.</i>

05:56.751 --> 05:58.834
Strzeminski.

05:59.001 --> 06:00.959
- First name?
- Wladyslaw.

06:02.626 --> 06:08.459
- Date and place of birth?
- 21 November 1893, in Minsk.

06:10.084 --> 06:12.167
A Soviet citizen.

06:12.584 --> 06:14.209
A Polish citizen.

06:18.292 --> 06:19.251
Profession?

06:19.667 --> 06:21.001
Painter.

06:21.584 --> 06:22.542
Artist.

06:25.751 --> 06:27.334
Place of work?

06:27.626 --> 06:31.459
The State High School of Fine Arts in Lodz,

06:31.626 --> 06:33.126
lecturer in art history.

06:37.001 --> 06:39.709
So, citizen Strzeminski...

06:39.876 --> 06:44.876
You'll have a trip to the Security Office.
And from there God knows where.

06:45.376 --> 06:48.042
So now God rules at the Security Office?

06:51.376 --> 06:53.043
Good morning, Professor.

06:53.959 --> 06:55.376
My office, please.

07:12.251 --> 07:13.959
Well...

07:14.292 --> 07:15.626
We have a problem with you.

07:16.126 --> 07:17.209
With me?

07:19.709 --> 07:20.876
With you.

07:22.251 --> 07:24.876
Professor, artist.

07:26.417 --> 07:29.417
You know full well that the country
is going in a new direction

07:29.751 --> 07:30.959
and you're opposed to it.

07:31.417 --> 07:34.417
In tsarist Russia, you'd be
packed off to Siberia for doing that.

07:35.167 --> 07:37.376
But we can't do that.

07:38.126 --> 07:39.792
Unfortunately, we have to educate.

07:41.542 --> 07:46.792
I'm not against you,
I just have different views about art.

07:49.917 --> 07:54.542
Let me read out to you
something I have here.

08:00.042 --> 08:02.209
Right, what do we have here?

08:03.667 --> 08:05.376
What do we have here?

08:07.834 --> 08:08.584
This is it.

08:16.292 --> 08:19.334
The line between politics
and art has disappeared

08:19.667 --> 08:25.001
as it turned out that the villainy in both
is the monopoly of the same evil group.

08:25.501 --> 08:27.626
Let's liquidate them without mercy,

08:27.792 --> 08:30.542
not just because they took over
the palaces of art and the press,

08:30.709 --> 08:37.458
but above all because they blocked fairness 
with all of their actions,

08:37.958 --> 08:42.583
because they're destroying
not only the arts, but above all the man.

08:42.751 --> 08:48.709
That's why painters, poets and writers
have already ceased to be just artists.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.792
You have become,
whether you wanted to or not,

08:50.959 --> 08:56.542
soldiers on the political... yes,
on the political part of the joint front.

08:56.751 --> 08:58.584
Do you recognize this?

08:58.834 --> 08:59.917
I wrote it.

09:00.834 --> 09:05.209
In autumn 1934, I think.

09:06.876 --> 09:09.542
It's not about you,
it's about the Sanation.

09:10.251 --> 09:12.459
Well, if it was 1934
for sure it's not about us.

09:12.626 --> 09:18.001
Although we were in the USSR then,
so it could have been about us.

09:19.876 --> 09:20.876
Mister Strzeminski...

09:22.709 --> 09:26.542
you have talent, you have a way with words,
I couldn't write it better myself.

09:27.459 --> 09:30.084
So why do you not want to join the changes

09:30.251 --> 09:33.126
instead of sabotaging our ideological line?

09:33.542 --> 09:36.792
After all, you used to be at the heart
of the revolution and now what?

09:44.834 --> 09:47.126
Mister Strzeminski...

09:47.417 --> 09:48.334
You're not stupid.

09:50.167 --> 09:52.751
But believe me, I'm not stupid either.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.917
You're standing at a crossroads

09:56.751 --> 09:59.501
and you can't stand there any longer.

10:00.417 --> 10:01.792
Whichever path you choose...

10:03.001 --> 10:04.834
you bring that fate upon yourself.

10:14.417 --> 10:19.251
Wladyslaw Strzeminski and
Katarzyna Kobro are avant-garde artists.

10:19.751 --> 10:25.584
In St. Petersburg, he worked with Malevich,
an outstanding, world-famous artist,

10:25.959 --> 10:28.917
in Moscow, after the revolution,
he took part in exhibitions.

10:29.584 --> 10:33.626
After returning to Poland, he settled in Lodz,
where he, Henryk Stazewski,

10:33.792 --> 10:38.292
the well-known poet Julian Przybos
and others formed the A.R. Group,

10:38.917 --> 10:41.417
which stands for Revolutionary Artists.

10:42.001 --> 10:46.334
In this room you can see the artist's pieces
from this period of his work...

10:47.042 --> 10:53.417
Strzeminski also designed this room,
called the Neoplastic Room.

10:54.751 --> 10:58.542
Here you can see unusual sculptures
by Katarzyna Kobro,

10:59.084 --> 11:01.959
the creator of the concept
of infinite space,

11:02.417 --> 11:06.501
please note the relationship between
these sculptures and modern architecture...

11:06.626 --> 11:09.751
You may come closer,
just don't touch the exhibits.

11:17.251 --> 11:19.334
Let's move on, please.

11:26.167 --> 11:27.292
Nika!

11:28.501 --> 11:34.667
- Are Strzeminski and Kobro your parents?
- Yes, they are.

11:36.542 --> 11:38.251
But they are not together.

12:11.001 --> 12:13.751
Good morning.

12:13.917 --> 12:16.042
And why is it so empty here?

12:16.709 --> 12:19.959
- It's Wednesday.
- I know it's Wednesday, so what?

12:20.542 --> 12:22.167
They are all in the hall

12:22.542 --> 12:25.251
for Professor Strzeminski's lecture.

12:25.626 --> 12:26.417
And you?

12:26.792 --> 12:28.292
I'm looking for the dean's office.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.709
- There, on your right.
- Thank you.

12:34.709 --> 12:38.917
Seeing is not a single,
unspecified, abstract act,

12:40.084 --> 12:44.876
but an action, a process of viewing
at a certain moment.

12:45.501 --> 12:50.251
Nature has its own "centres of interest"
that draw greater attention.

12:52.001 --> 12:56.459
We look at it while moving
from one point of interest to another.

12:57.917 --> 13:04.834
When we gaze at a Van Gogh landscape,
we see the identical, repeated divisions.

13:05.459 --> 13:11.626
How should we look at nature to see it 
as it was painted by Van Gogh?

13:12.209 --> 13:17.376
And was he looking at it with
a normal, natural, physiological gaze?

13:18.584 --> 13:20.501
The look that we use?

13:21.792 --> 13:25.917
The answer comes when we draw our glances
projected onto the landscape.

13:26.084 --> 13:32.334
Four glances along the horizon,
each focusing on its own centre of interest.

13:33.126 --> 13:36.626
So the repeated identical divisions
show up in the picture

13:36.834 --> 13:42.876
not because the "formalist" Van Gogh
wished it for unknown subjective reasons

13:43.084 --> 13:50.126
but because he accurately reproduced
the process of viewing the landscape

13:50.292 --> 13:56.084
with the four parallel,
sequentially directed glances.

13:56.376 --> 13:57.834
Comrades, colleagues!

13:59.376 --> 14:03.709
Let me remind you that today
we're hosting the Minister of Culture.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.667
This is a lecture.

14:07.001 --> 14:08.292
Please leave, close the door!

14:08.709 --> 14:11.126
After the speech of Comrade Minister
there will be a meeting

14:11.292 --> 14:15.959
and a debate about our school
and our artistic circles.

14:16.209 --> 14:17.917
Please stop this class immediately

14:18.084 --> 14:22.251
and prepare the room because in one hour
we will be hosting our honourable guest!

14:22.917 --> 14:24.459
Attendance is compulsory.

14:24.751 --> 14:26.876
The prefects will check attendance.

14:31.917 --> 14:35.667
And this is the realism of Van Gogh.

14:37.876 --> 14:44.917
The realism of a living material man,
a man who sees not in the abstract,

14:45.084 --> 14:48.584
but through the living material organism
of his physiological body.

14:49.792 --> 14:55.251
Not a spiritual reception of experiences,
but a physiological one.

14:58.126 --> 14:59.501
Thank you.

15:19.292 --> 15:22.792
And what brings the director
of the Art Museum here?

15:22.959 --> 15:24.376
Why? You don't know?

15:24.542 --> 15:28.167
On Wednesdays I listen
to the great lectures of Professor Strzeminski.

15:28.876 --> 15:31.459
I don't know how long
he will remain a professor here.

15:31.834 --> 15:33.751
Professor!

15:35.584 --> 15:40.126
- The Varsovian says she can type.
- I moonlighted as a typist, 200 words.

15:40.292 --> 15:41.626
Really?
And what else can you do?

15:42.334 --> 15:46.001
I can type up the "Theory of Vision",
it'll take me just a few days if you dictate,

15:46.167 --> 15:48.834
- or a week, if I do it from the notes...
- Let's type up what there is...

15:49.001 --> 15:52.084
The office has an old German typewriter,

15:52.417 --> 15:56.709
they've got new Czech ones,
but I'm not in with the secretaries...

15:56.876 --> 15:59.334
I am. We'll try talking with them.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.501
So Roman and I will go.

16:01.959 --> 16:05.042
Professor, can we come round tonight?

16:05.251 --> 16:06.501
Of course, you're all welcome.

16:14.584 --> 16:16.876
Rector, please don't exaggerate.

16:19.292 --> 16:23.084
Professor Strzeminski has provided
great service for this city.

16:23.251 --> 16:27.584
He created the first museum of modern art in Poland 
and the second in Europe.

16:28.501 --> 16:31.417
- His position is unassailable.
- You think so?

16:32.584 --> 16:36.209
Will you stay for
the meeting with the minister?

16:37.292 --> 16:39.417
- I will.
- Thank you very much.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.459
It's very good that you're here.

16:43.626 --> 16:46.751
It is our duty to be present
wherever issues important for culture are decided.

16:47.251 --> 16:51.667
- I'm afraid we'll be handcuffed.
- Don't come outwith anything like that.

17:04.126 --> 17:06.834
Ladies and gentlemen, today is a great day.

17:07.251 --> 17:11.209
I warmly welcome our esteemed
Minister of Culture.

17:24.459 --> 17:27.459
The nation has the right to place
its demands on artists

17:27.626 --> 17:32.001
and one of the most basic demands is
that the deeper layers of a work of art,

17:32.167 --> 17:34.626
its objective, its intentions

17:35.626 --> 17:37.501
should meet the needs of the people,

17:37.667 --> 17:41.376
not to raise doubts,
when what they need is enthusiasm,

17:41.709 --> 17:42.917
belief in victory,

17:43.167 --> 17:45.751
not to apotheosise depression,

17:47.459 --> 17:49.959
when the people want to live and work.

17:50.876 --> 17:54.001
The next steps in the Party's offensive
in the creative circles

17:54.626 --> 17:57.376
are set out by the following demands:

17:58.167 --> 18:00.667
of socialist realism in art,

18:00.834 --> 18:05.542
of the fight against "cosmopolitanism
and servility to Western culture"

18:05.876 --> 18:12.626
with the use of the achievements of Soviet artists
and their ties with the masses.

18:14.959 --> 18:18.001
The Party will defend socialist realism

18:18.292 --> 18:21.459
despite the fact that
it can cause schematicism,

18:21.626 --> 18:24.001
but that should not trouble us.

18:25.542 --> 18:32.792
We need to revolt against formalistic
and cynical art which lacks ideology,

18:32.959 --> 18:40.459
against decadent capitalist art,
and against American cosmopolitanism.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.459
I therefore repeat with all my might:

18:45.626 --> 18:50.667
Art that proclaims a lack of ideology
is the enemy of the working man!

18:57.834 --> 19:03.209
Minister, may we first pose the question:
What is a work of art?

19:04.834 --> 19:08.209
For me, a work of art is about
a specific form rather than flat realism.

19:09.292 --> 19:10.376
I've always said

19:10.542 --> 19:15.501
I'd fight for the model of art
which is most suitable for a given period,

19:15.667 --> 19:18.542
because art is a laboratory of forms.

19:19.334 --> 19:22.292
In art, the only ones who matter are those
who pave the way for new forms.

19:23.001 --> 19:30.126
New art should demand respect
not for its usefulness but for its superiority.

19:31.834 --> 19:36.751
But I see that now you seek
to lose the boundary between art

19:37.876 --> 19:39.876
and politics,

19:40.042 --> 19:42.834
and what's worse it has become
the interest of one group.

19:46.167 --> 19:47.084
Thank you.

20:05.292 --> 20:08.459
Oh, today you're much later, Professor.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.709
Move it.

20:13.959 --> 20:16.542
- Here you are.
- There's the money for last month.

20:23.001 --> 20:24.417
- Bon Appetit.
- Thank you.

21:00.792 --> 21:06.626
If anyone disagrees with this statement
"Strzeminski spreads ferment at the school,

21:06.834 --> 21:11.126
he undermines the authority of other lecturers, 
and promotes pure formalism

21:11.834 --> 21:15.751
at a time when art is supposed
to stimulate society into action",

21:16.001 --> 21:18.334
please raise your hands.

21:22.917 --> 21:31.501
No-one. In that case, I propose the motion
of condemnation of Professor Strzeminski

21:31.792 --> 21:34.709
and I put it to a vote.
Who's in favour?

21:41.417 --> 21:46.376
I'm counting on your responsibility, comrades.

21:47.251 --> 21:50.876
I think we need more time to think.

21:51.042 --> 21:53.292
I am very sorry Rector, but...

21:53.459 --> 21:57.459
as his student, I know how much
he devotes to his students.

21:57.626 --> 21:59.459
This is about his ideological stance.

21:59.667 --> 22:03.042
Our general line of fighting
for socialist realism

22:03.251 --> 22:10.251
was outlined by the great Marxist classics:
by Lenin, and by Stalin's words.

22:10.417 --> 22:14.834
Yes, of course I understand that,
but I still have my doubts.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.626
In this room are gathered teachers
and also members of the Party.

22:18.792 --> 22:24.917
Comrade, why don't you show more confidence
in our collective experience?

22:26.001 --> 22:28.667
I'd advise you to change your position.

22:30.667 --> 22:34.001
I repeat the vote.
Who is in favour?

22:40.917 --> 22:43.334
- Roman!
- Where are you going?

22:52.376 --> 22:56.959
When the storm winds blow,

22:57.417 --> 23:01.084
no-one has fear in their hearts,

23:02.042 --> 23:05.376
because we know that Stalin... No...

23:05.917 --> 23:10.501
Because we know that Stalin...

23:11.751 --> 23:13.834
is watching us with hope...

23:14.334 --> 23:16.292
from the Kremlin.

23:23.709 --> 23:25.542
You smoke too much.

23:32.334 --> 23:36.126
Dawn breaks with His smile.

23:36.292 --> 23:38.667
All worries disappear.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.126
We happily move to great deeds.

23:43.126 --> 23:44.167
The people,

23:44.584 --> 23:47.501
workers and peasants.

23:52.251 --> 23:55.001
Dad, I don't have any
place at school to learn this.

23:58.917 --> 24:00.292
Oh, and there's this.

24:06.876 --> 24:08.917
- What is it?
- A prescription.

24:09.167 --> 24:11.334
- For you?
- No, for mom.

24:13.251 --> 24:15.792
The money's in my coat pocket.
Take it.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.167
All of it?

24:30.709 --> 24:31.376
Bye-bye.

24:43.292 --> 24:46.001
Why don't you go in?

24:47.667 --> 24:50.751
Class Cancelled

25:00.834 --> 25:05.959
- Why are my classes cancelled?
- We received a letter about you.

25:14.251 --> 25:15.959
Why are my classes canceled?

25:19.001 --> 25:24.834
In accordance with paragraph 6
of the employment contracts with staff,

25:25.542 --> 25:31.626
I order the immediate termination
of the contract with Professor Strzeminski

25:31.792 --> 25:35.209
with effect from 31 March 1950.

25:35.626 --> 25:39.709
At the same time, Professor Strzeminski
will be granted paid leave

25:39.876 --> 25:42.626
for the period up to
the date of termination.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.792
Artists have leave?

25:46.001 --> 25:47.292
Paid?

25:50.959 --> 25:55.084
That is the decision of Comrade Minister.

26:12.126 --> 26:15.417
We'd like to continue studies with you,
not in the school.

26:16.667 --> 26:20.084
Who will give you your papers
if you leave the school?

26:20.376 --> 26:22.667
The school is a good place.
I co-founded it.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.709
What is happening now
is just the wind of history.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.334
It will calm down and pass.

26:29.501 --> 26:31.001
Don't do anything stupid.

26:31.376 --> 26:34.376
Ok, but what happens now, Professor?

26:34.917 --> 26:36.251
What? I do not know.

26:36.459 --> 26:39.626
New times are coming.
Nothing will be like it was before.

26:56.917 --> 26:59.876
- Goodbye, Professor.
- Goodbye.

27:06.501 --> 27:08.167
He spoke like a prophet.

27:08.334 --> 27:13.667
- You're so in love, you're blind to the world.
- He's just opened my eyes to it.

27:17.084 --> 27:18.501
Hania, Hania...

27:52.667 --> 27:54.959
Relax, I won't disturb you.

27:57.917 --> 27:59.084
You smoke too much.

28:45.042 --> 28:46.417
I am not hungry.

28:47.417 --> 28:48.751
Oh, dad!

28:51.751 --> 28:54.292
I made these pancakes.

28:57.376 --> 29:00.042
Not mom.

29:04.417 --> 29:07.626
One winter she pulled you on a sledge.

29:08.459 --> 29:09.626
You remember that?

29:10.542 --> 29:14.126
You were four... five then.

29:15.542 --> 29:17.751
It's good it was winter.

29:17.917 --> 29:19.376
She pulled the sledge across the ice.

29:19.542 --> 29:21.876
You were sitting,
and your crutches lay on the sledge.

29:22.042 --> 29:26.626
Then she was so tired she had no
strength to sledge downhill with me.

29:31.334 --> 29:32.959
Take it away.

29:50.334 --> 29:52.584
Mum used to sew this up for you.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.667
And now?

29:58.501 --> 30:00.626
What is that letter?

30:01.417 --> 30:02.459
That one?

30:02.834 --> 30:04.209
My sentence.

30:14.251 --> 30:15.959
They fired you from work.

30:28.251 --> 30:33.042
Wladyslaw Strzeminski is the most important
Polish artist of the 20th century.

30:34.251 --> 30:38.167
You poets have such a remarkable tendency
for ecstasy and exaggeration.

30:44.042 --> 30:44.751
Alright, alright.

30:48.751 --> 30:49.751
After the revolution,

30:52.126 --> 30:58.084
Strzeminski worked with Kandinsky,
Chagall and Malevich.

30:58.251 --> 31:00.709
Has-been artists!
For us, just renegades and traitors.

31:02.001 --> 31:05.084
He is a lecturer, students love him.

31:05.334 --> 31:09.209
I appreciate your gestures of friendship 
towards Strzeminski,

31:09.542 --> 31:12.167
but please answer me one question.

31:12.334 --> 31:14.042
As an artist,

31:14.459 --> 31:16.001
Comrade Przybos,

31:16.167 --> 31:19.376
whose side are you really on?

31:21.376 --> 31:24.751
- Well... on yours.
- On 'yours'?

31:26.167 --> 31:27.251
Or... 'ours'?

31:27.792 --> 31:31.042
Remember that in these times
there's only one choice!

31:31.376 --> 31:33.292
But in art, that is death.

31:33.584 --> 31:37.251
- In art, different worlds must collide.
- But the world is already determined.

31:37.417 --> 31:40.584
Everyone's fighting on the ideological front.
Why would we need Strzeminski?

31:40.792 --> 31:43.417
All these "formalisms"
and "avant-gardes" of his,

31:43.584 --> 31:45.751
these "unisms" and "afterimages".

31:46.459 --> 31:48.209
This does not build socialism.

31:49.251 --> 31:50.251
Right...

31:51.876 --> 31:55.334
You've been stuck in Switzerland
as our ambassador for too long.

31:55.834 --> 31:58.292
I think you'll better understand
the modern world,

31:58.459 --> 32:02.417
when you visit the Great Exhibition
of Soviet Painting.

32:03.126 --> 32:04.167
Very enlightening.

32:23.501 --> 32:26.459
And you, Mr. Strzeminski,

32:26.667 --> 32:28.167
you know,

32:29.251 --> 32:31.167
you should be hit by a tram!

32:45.709 --> 32:47.876
- Good morning, Professor.
- Hello, Professor.

32:48.959 --> 32:50.167
- Hello.
- Hello.

32:50.334 --> 32:53.167
Professor, please take a look.

32:59.126 --> 32:59.959
Professor,

33:02.334 --> 33:03.709
these are our pictures

33:04.126 --> 33:05.584
for Saturday's exhibition at the YMCA.

33:05.792 --> 33:07.417
It's the only place we can exhibit.

33:07.584 --> 33:08.501
I suppose so...

33:08.792 --> 33:10.334
But what do you think about them?

33:10.667 --> 33:12.292
Every choice is good

33:12.459 --> 33:14.209
because it is yours.

33:14.751 --> 33:18.792
To find your way, don't paint like Mondrian,
because he has already done it.

33:19.126 --> 33:23.042
Even Mondrian should
not paint like Mondrian.

33:23.626 --> 33:28.251
- Don't even paint like Strzeminski.
- Even you should not paint like Strzeminski.

33:28.751 --> 33:29.876
You're right there!

33:31.042 --> 33:33.209
Professor, you were assistant to Malevich,

33:33.376 --> 33:37.376
I mean he must have known that his
abstractions would be incomprehensible,

33:37.542 --> 33:39.126
incomprehensible to people.

33:40.542 --> 33:43.501
Malevich closed himself off
in combinations of geometric forms.

33:43.792 --> 33:46.792
You can admire all these works,

33:46.959 --> 33:51.167
but only to reject them and seek
your own form of expression.

33:51.584 --> 33:52.417
But how to find it?

33:55.792 --> 33:57.167
The choice is always up to you.

33:58.001 --> 34:02.584
In art and love you can only give
what you have.

34:07.709 --> 34:09.251
And here you have a different answer:

34:10.417 --> 34:16.042
We expect artists' paintings
to be deeply realistic,

34:16.292 --> 34:21.001
showing the world in a revolutionary way,
in the spirit of socialist demands.

34:21.376 --> 34:26.042
Art that proclaims a lack of ideology
or indifference to social issues

34:26.251 --> 34:30.708
is basically art of an ideology
that's hostile to progress,

34:30.876 --> 34:34.751
to every working man. There's never been
and never will be any neutral art.

34:34.917 --> 34:38.001
That's what they wrote after
the National Festival of Fine Arts.

34:40.333 --> 34:45.792
I also used to believe the only purpose of art
was to serve social change.

34:46.501 --> 34:49.667
But that was in 1919.

34:50.292 --> 34:51.751
I still believed in the revolution.

34:51.917 --> 34:55.626
- So now you're not in favour of realism?
- Well...

34:58.542 --> 35:02.167
I think that you need to paint
in harmony with yourself,

35:03.084 --> 35:05.417
if I haven't convinced you,
then do something else.

35:05.584 --> 35:07.001
No, no!

35:29.501 --> 35:30.501
Goodbye, Professor!

35:30.667 --> 35:33.209
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye, Professor!

35:37.751 --> 35:38.667
Goodbye!

36:08.959 --> 36:10.084
Hanka?

36:12.042 --> 36:13.876
You were expecting someone.

36:21.542 --> 36:23.584
Somebody else...

36:27.792 --> 36:30.167
Your students keep coming to you?

36:30.334 --> 36:31.459
They are.

36:32.459 --> 36:34.876
Nika, put it away.

36:39.209 --> 36:42.001
Mom said they don't know
what they are doing.

36:42.542 --> 36:43.792
Who?

36:44.459 --> 36:46.084
Those who fired you.

36:51.251 --> 36:52.209
You remember that?

36:52.376 --> 36:53.584
Mom used to sew these.

36:54.042 --> 36:55.917
She sold them at the market.

36:58.709 --> 37:02.001
I took it for her.
I'll take it to her at the hospital.

37:02.834 --> 37:04.292
So that she remembers

37:05.334 --> 37:07.209
that it used to be even worse.

37:23.709 --> 37:27.834
The October Revolution
led to the triumph of socialism.

37:28.542 --> 37:33.542
It showed the masses all over the world
can free themselves from the exploiters

37:33.917 --> 37:38.292
and build a new life to ensure
the universal development of man.

37:41.417 --> 37:42.459
Sit!

37:44.584 --> 37:46.626
Nika Strzeminska.

37:49.667 --> 37:50.876
Come with me.

39:24.584 --> 39:27.667
At her mother's funeral in a red coat!

39:30.334 --> 39:32.459
I have no other coat.

41:22.251 --> 41:24.084
That's it, enough!

41:25.459 --> 41:26.834
Back to the car.

42:43.084 --> 42:45.251
That's what I could expect.

42:59.709 --> 43:00.792
What are you doing here?

43:05.084 --> 43:08.084
I have been billeted to this apartment.

43:11.459 --> 43:14.251
And me?
What am I supposed to do?

43:15.209 --> 43:17.876
You're not an orphan, are you?
You have a father.

43:18.417 --> 43:20.876
Besides, you've already lived on...
Karolewska St.?

43:21.084 --> 43:22.126
In the children's home.

43:54.959 --> 43:57.084
These are sculptures
by the famous sculptor,

43:57.251 --> 43:58.251
Katarzyna Kobro,

43:58.417 --> 43:59.917
my mother.

44:00.584 --> 44:02.626
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

44:02.917 --> 44:05.084
Please don't move them.

44:11.001 --> 44:13.292
That's the way that children see.

44:13.751 --> 44:17.042
My daughter drew it when she was six.

44:17.251 --> 44:19.167
It's contour vision.

44:19.334 --> 44:20.959
Everyone sees differently.

44:21.126 --> 44:24.834
The purpose of art
is to dictate its rights on reality.

44:25.001 --> 44:27.084
And yet, they dictate to us.

44:27.292 --> 44:28.626
I'll type this down.

44:28.959 --> 44:30.751
If it won't cause you any trouble.

44:31.167 --> 44:32.959
So you already know, Professor?

44:33.626 --> 44:34.251
About what?

44:37.459 --> 44:40.501
Your "Theory of Vision"
is banned at the School.

44:40.667 --> 44:43.751
Yes, the rector is doing everything
to remove every last trace of you!

44:45.459 --> 44:47.709
I don't want you to risk anything.
They can expel you.

44:47.876 --> 44:49.959
Professor!

44:54.917 --> 44:56.501
What's happened?

45:12.667 --> 45:14.001
When?

45:14.584 --> 45:15.501
The day before yesterday.

45:16.876 --> 45:20.417
- Why didn't I know?
- She didn't want you to be at the funeral.

45:23.334 --> 45:24.709
Pity.

45:26.584 --> 45:29.834
I would put blue flowers on her grave.

45:30.334 --> 45:31.542
Blue ones?

45:31.876 --> 45:33.417
Why that colour?

45:33.751 --> 45:36.959
She had such blue eyes.

45:38.126 --> 45:38.792
Beautiful ones.

45:39.584 --> 45:40.584
You also have the same.

45:46.667 --> 45:48.126
Can I stay here?

46:10.334 --> 46:13.917
After the liberation, she bought it
at the Green Market for 60 zlotys.

46:14.376 --> 46:15.834
Remember?

46:17.584 --> 46:20.126
She baptized you in an Orthodox church.

46:20.834 --> 46:22.042
Not my fault.

46:22.459 --> 46:24.626
Then you christened me in a Catholic one.

46:26.001 --> 46:28.584
So which am I in the end?

46:44.209 --> 46:46.417
Sir, can we start?

46:50.001 --> 46:51.334
Yes, we can.

46:54.709 --> 46:57.126
Ladies and gentlemen,
please leave the room.

46:57.501 --> 46:59.459
But why? I've only just come in.

46:59.667 --> 47:02.876
- These are our orders. Please leave.
- But what customs are these?

47:03.167 --> 47:04.834
Please do as I say.
Come in.

47:05.417 --> 47:07.459
Hurry up, come on!

47:08.667 --> 47:09.834
You know what to do.

47:45.459 --> 47:47.042
This way, faster.

47:55.501 --> 47:57.292
Sir, what's going on?

47:58.292 --> 48:00.542
I'm sorry, Roza,
these are the orders I got.

48:02.334 --> 48:05.709
Liquidate the Neoplastic Room immediately!

48:05.876 --> 48:07.417
New times are coming.

48:24.459 --> 48:26.501
Professor, don't you remember me?

48:26.876 --> 48:29.001
Roza Saltzman, right?

48:30.376 --> 48:31.417
So you do remember!

48:36.334 --> 48:38.459
Well, you were my student.

48:41.834 --> 48:43.626
Professor, I...

48:44.001 --> 48:45.209
I'm going away for good.

48:45.626 --> 48:46.959
To Israel.

48:48.501 --> 48:51.667
If you could entrust me with but a few...

48:53.042 --> 48:56.792
Have you got those collages
"To My Friends, Jews"?

48:58.209 --> 49:01.209
Professor, I've just been
in the Museum of Art,

49:01.584 --> 49:03.709
to say goodbye to your work,
but I could not.

49:03.917 --> 49:05.584
Do you know
what is happening there?

49:06.417 --> 49:08.001
The Neoplastic Room has been liquidated.

49:08.167 --> 49:09.626
I saw it with my own eyes.

49:14.876 --> 49:16.667
Professor...

49:16.834 --> 49:18.959
What you created should be safe...

49:21.001 --> 49:24.751
Then the world will have access to it...

50:34.667 --> 50:38.292
Association of Polish
Artists and Designers - Lodz

50:44.834 --> 50:46.584
Hello, Professor.

50:49.959 --> 50:51.334
Good morning.

50:51.876 --> 50:56.167
I would like to ask
for my advance payment and food stamps.

50:56.334 --> 50:57.751
Morning, Professor.

50:58.459 --> 50:59.834
What advance?

51:00.084 --> 51:06.542
Here's the documentation for the design
approved by the contractor.

51:06.709 --> 51:09.209
It's a bas-relief for the "Exotic" cafe.

51:09.959 --> 51:11.917
Professor, you're not entitled
to any advance,

51:12.084 --> 51:14.751
because the commission
has not yet approved the design.

51:17.167 --> 51:18.542
May I have your membership ID?

51:30.709 --> 51:33.709
Professor, it's invalid,
it's not stamped.

51:35.126 --> 51:38.417
You have been unlawfully using
an outdated ID of the Association.

51:39.709 --> 51:42.584
I've been a member since it was founded.

51:44.876 --> 51:46.292
I pay my membership fees.

51:55.876 --> 51:56.751
The President?

52:00.209 --> 52:01.792
The President is not here today.

52:03.376 --> 52:07.042
Professor, in January
you were excluded from the Association.

52:07.834 --> 52:10.751
We sent you a letter with the decision.
Didn't you receive it?

52:11.751 --> 52:13.542
Now, there will be a problem
with those fees.

52:13.709 --> 52:17.126
You'll have to write to the President
to request a refund.

52:18.834 --> 52:20.501
Do you want to see
a sample request letter?

52:20.834 --> 52:22.126
Professor?

52:54.584 --> 52:55.667
Here you are.

53:14.001 --> 53:16.876
Professor, please eat
or it will go cold again...

53:25.459 --> 53:28.126
Someone has sent
the Association's commission after you.

53:28.292 --> 53:32.834
They're questioning your work.
But we'll show them your inspirations.

53:33.501 --> 53:36.292
That it shows the years
of colonial exploitation.

53:36.542 --> 53:39.459
- That's the title I gave it.
- Konrad hopes it'll convince them.

53:45.876 --> 53:48.167
- Why are you here?
- Let me through.

53:48.584 --> 53:50.376
What's going on here?
What are you doing?!

53:50.792 --> 53:54.751
As the commission of the Artists' Association
we made the decision to liquidate your work.

53:54.917 --> 53:56.584
Listen, citizen Strzeminski.

53:56.876 --> 53:57.917
Stop!

53:59.376 --> 54:02.751
Minutes of the review on the acceptance
of the decor of the "Exotic" cafe in Lodz.

54:02.959 --> 54:06.626
Gentlemen, don't destroy this.
I'll cover it with this curtain.

54:07.876 --> 54:08.542
Get out of here.

54:08.709 --> 54:11.709
...of the decor of the "Exotic" cafe
in Lodz on Piotrkowska St.

54:11.876 --> 54:15.042
- Gentlemen, it's a work of art.
- I said, get out of here.

54:16.459 --> 54:19.042
The Commission composed of
Jerzy Grygiel, Romuald Jackowski,

54:19.626 --> 54:22.459
Jerzy Mazurczyk, Ignacy Guttman
has decided as follows:

54:22.709 --> 54:25.334
After inspecting the site
of the premises of the "Exotic" cafe,

54:25.501 --> 54:30.584
The commission does not accept
the decor made with polychrome reliefs.

54:31.376 --> 54:35.626
Liquidation of the bas-relief is recommended
under the supervision of the representatives

54:36.001 --> 54:39.709
of the Regional Board of the Association
of Polish Artists and Designers in Lodz.

54:39.876 --> 54:43.459
In the opinion of the review commission,
the character of the cafe's decor

54:43.626 --> 54:46.209
is contrary to current standards in the arts

54:46.376 --> 54:49.209
resulting from socialist realism.
Signed...

54:51.626 --> 54:55.209
Nonsense! I have entitled this project
"Colonial Exploitation".

54:56.709 --> 54:59.834
These are original works of African art...

55:04.126 --> 55:07.584
- That's why the cafe is called "Exotic".
- An English book, huh?

55:07.751 --> 55:09.709
Imperialists might like it...

55:10.501 --> 55:16.959
Professor, you disagree with the review committee
made up of your colleagues.

55:17.751 --> 55:18.959
So whose side are you on?

55:19.834 --> 55:21.126
On mine.

55:23.417 --> 55:24.501
On mine.

55:30.001 --> 55:31.917
Keep going.

55:32.084 --> 55:33.751
Get back to work!

55:54.751 --> 55:56.292
I got an A.

55:56.501 --> 55:58.209
In Polish.

56:00.792 --> 56:02.251
The only one in the class.

56:28.042 --> 56:29.376
I'll make you some fresh.

57:15.084 --> 57:16.709
I have a ream of paper.

57:43.251 --> 57:44.126
Coffee.

57:44.667 --> 57:46.126
I also bought these on the way.

57:46.709 --> 57:48.084
Dad, you smoke too much.

58:04.876 --> 58:06.542
It's come loose again.

58:07.042 --> 58:08.501
Do you know where the scissors are?

58:38.292 --> 58:39.626
Where is the icon?

58:42.209 --> 58:43.209
In the drawer.

59:12.417 --> 59:15.667
I'm going back to the girls' home,
it's closer to school.

59:17.917 --> 59:19.792
There is no room for me here.

59:37.542 --> 59:39.667
She will have a hard life.

01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:06.626
Contrasts of colours, of textures,

01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:08.876
the clash of shapes,

01:00:09.376 --> 01:00:13.376
they bring time into the area of the image.

01:00:14.584 --> 01:00:16.167
Slower, Professor.

01:00:17.417 --> 01:00:19.417
In each composition

01:00:19.584 --> 01:00:25.417
each part has an awareness of the whole.

01:00:26.084 --> 01:00:30.167
...has an awareness of...

01:00:33.209 --> 01:00:34.292
Come in.

01:00:39.167 --> 01:00:40.292
Julian!

01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:43.709
Welcome!

01:00:48.626 --> 01:00:50.459
Sorry, we're done for today.

01:00:50.626 --> 01:00:53.084
- This is the famous poet?
- Yes.

01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:56.709
How do you do? Hanna Borowska.

01:00:56.876 --> 01:00:57.501
Julian.

01:00:58.167 --> 01:01:01.084
- Let me take that for you.
- Thank you very much.

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:10.584
Forgive me, I've run out of coffee.

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:13.834
Wladyslaw...

01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:15.417
Here you are.

01:01:16.459 --> 01:01:18.834
I know how much coffee you use.

01:01:20.167 --> 01:01:22.126
Why don't I make you some coffee?

01:01:22.501 --> 01:01:23.459
Thank you.

01:01:25.126 --> 01:01:28.167
You have your faithful students,

01:01:29.292 --> 01:01:30.584
who remember about you.

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:33.501
Young people are always
against the existing world.

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.667
Wladyslaw...

01:01:40.917 --> 01:01:42.917
I say this with envy.

01:01:44.126 --> 01:01:49.376
Although over all these years
your art has changed,

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:53.667
you're still yourself.

01:01:55.376 --> 01:02:00.417
I write most of my poetry for the drawer,
they won't print it as it's 'too vague'.

01:02:10.709 --> 01:02:12.459
They praise the ones who suck up.

01:02:13.001 --> 01:02:14.792
They're silent about the real artists.

01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:22.251
I spoke about this with Milosz.

01:02:23.001 --> 01:02:28.626
He also believes that an artist who can't speak
with a full voice should be silent.

01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:33.084
- <i>This is 'Wave 49' calling!</i>
- Artists can be killed in two ways:

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:36.126
either by talking about them too much
or not at all.

01:02:36.292 --> 01:02:37.917
<i>The Party is the force</i>

01:02:38.084 --> 01:02:42.084
<i>that has led our country out of the ruins
and economic backwardness.</i>

01:02:42.251 --> 01:02:44.876
<i>It is the backbone
and the brain of the nation.</i>

01:02:45.042 --> 01:02:50.001
<i>The Party had the power to make
such revolutionary changes in Poland</i>

01:02:50.459 --> 01:02:54.209
<i>only because it is
the expression and the organiser...</i>

01:02:54.542 --> 01:02:57.209
- Coffee.
- <i>...of the purest will of millions.</i>

01:02:57.376 --> 01:02:58.876
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:00.834
<i>This is shown</i>

01:03:01.001 --> 01:03:03.834
<i>by the growing respect for the Party</i>

01:03:04.001 --> 01:03:07.209
- <i>among independents and even among people...</i>
- Let's drink.

01:03:07.376 --> 01:03:08.417
<i>...shaped differently.</i>

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:11.792
Like in the old days,
when we didn't need to whisper.

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:16.959
<i>Many Poles may never study
any Marxist work.</i>

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:21.209
<i>But absolutely everyone now knows,</i>

01:03:21.417 --> 01:03:25.876
<i>that what the Party promises
always comes true</i>

01:03:26.167 --> 01:03:29.917
<i>and that what the Party is aiming at is right.</i>

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:48.209
- Professor...
- Good afternoon.

01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:50.542
Professor, can Roman come up here?

01:03:51.042 --> 01:03:51.834
Roman?

01:03:52.001 --> 01:03:54.334
He's waiting downstairs for your decision.

01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:55.501
He feels like a traitor.

01:03:55.667 --> 01:03:58.834
- They kicked him out of the school.
- What for?

01:03:59.084 --> 01:04:03.167
He wrote his father was a janitor,
but he was really a governor.

01:04:03.334 --> 01:04:05.709
They even threw in
the theft of the typewriter.

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:09.209
- You didn't give it back?
- I did, but you know how it is.

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:40.501
Hello, Professor.

01:04:46.334 --> 01:04:48.334
We have good news.

01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:53.001
There's work for you.

01:04:53.542 --> 01:04:54.584
At a school?

01:04:56.292 --> 01:05:00.667
At the PSS Co-op.

01:05:01.001 --> 01:05:05.126
- But why there?
- Because they're looking for decorators.

01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:09.042
And everywhere I asked they know...
Damn!

01:05:09.376 --> 01:05:15.334
They know they may have problems with you.
But there your name doesn't mean anything.

01:05:18.876 --> 01:05:20.167
I didn't mean... that...

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:21.626
Alright, I'll try.

01:05:44.709 --> 01:05:46.042
As we agreed.

01:05:55.292 --> 01:06:04.167
The Municipal Committee is pushing us
to hire veterans, even better, disabled ones.

01:06:07.376 --> 01:06:11.959
- The authorities are promoting humanism.
- So he fits perfectly.

01:06:12.126 --> 01:06:14.751
He's got an arm and leg missing
and he can handle a paintbrush.

01:06:15.501 --> 01:06:16.876
And he's the best in the business.

01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:19.751
Right.

01:06:20.459 --> 01:06:23.917
Where did you lose your arm and leg?
During the war?

01:06:24.126 --> 01:06:24.917
Yes.

01:06:25.501 --> 01:06:26.834
But the first one.

01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:32.292
Take a seat.

01:06:35.584 --> 01:06:38.751
How will you do it?
With just one hand?

01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:40.959
I can present my work.

01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:48.501
Roman has vouched for you.

01:06:48.667 --> 01:06:52.126
He said that you have
some idea about this work...

01:06:52.959 --> 01:06:53.667
That's right.

01:06:55.334 --> 01:06:56.876
Well, I don't know...

01:06:57.042 --> 01:06:58.167
What don't you know?

01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:05.209
- You seem to fit perfectly...
- Exactly.

01:07:05.376 --> 01:07:06.876
But... but if...

01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:10.251
But what if...
It's harder to fire an invalid...

01:07:23.084 --> 01:07:24.667
Fill this in.

01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:30.126
At the payroll office you can get
your food stamps and an advance.

01:07:35.959 --> 01:07:37.792
Just don't hang around the office here...

01:07:39.292 --> 01:07:41.251
Art isn't meant to be decoration.

01:07:41.417 --> 01:07:43.584
Art is meant to be a discovery.

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:47.917
The process of receiving art is the process
of accumulating visual awareness.

01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:52.751
A person really only sees
what he is aware of,

01:07:53.126 --> 01:07:58.417
but visual awareness does not
develop by itself automatically.

01:07:59.626 --> 01:08:00.876
Have we got that?

01:08:01.959 --> 01:08:03.626
- Of vision...
- Yes.

01:08:05.126 --> 01:08:08.834
We did not receive our vision
fully-formed and unchanging.

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:09.959
Hang on, wait!

01:08:13.501 --> 01:08:14.959
It's here.

01:08:16.001 --> 01:08:20.959
Our eye was formed as a result
of a long biological evolution,

01:08:21.167 --> 01:08:25.001
from lower quality forms
to what it is now.

01:08:39.876 --> 01:08:41.126
Excuse me.

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:43.667
Where can I find Mr. Strzeminski?

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:50.459
- And who is he? What does he do here?
- He's an artist.

01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:55.292
- This isn't a circus, no artists here.
- He's a painter.

01:08:56.792 --> 01:08:59.001
Over there, in the studio.

01:09:17.251 --> 01:09:18.667
How did you find me?

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:20.876
Miss Hanka told me.

01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:24.542
Does she have a key?

01:09:25.001 --> 01:09:26.251
Why?

01:09:29.417 --> 01:09:31.751
The students are working on my book there.

01:09:46.084 --> 01:09:47.209
Will you wait for me?

01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:09.626
- Where did you get it?
- The school gave it to us...

01:10:10.376 --> 01:10:12.876
I have to wear it for the march.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.584
But then I have to give it back.

01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:18.251
I'm going for a get-together...

01:10:18.459 --> 01:10:21.001
You know, Dad,
I'm going to carry the banner.

01:10:21.876 --> 01:10:23.334
Are you coming?

01:10:49.959 --> 01:10:54.084
<i>That's how Red Lodz celebrates May Day.</i>

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.292
<i>Arm in arm,</i>

01:10:55.542 --> 01:11:01.792
<i>row upon row, over 300 thousand employees 
of factories and institutions,</i>

01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:05.334
<i>proud to carry out
their May Day duties.</i>

01:11:06.126 --> 01:11:07.667
<i>Men and women from textile plants,</i>

01:11:07.834 --> 01:11:08.792
<i>railwaymen,</i>

01:11:08.959 --> 01:11:09.876
<i>sportspeople,</i>

01:11:10.042 --> 01:11:12.084
<i>peasants from all over the region</i>

01:11:12.251 --> 01:11:14.459
<i>as well as scientists and artists,</i>

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:17.709
<i>town hall clerks, doctors, teachers,</i>

01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:25.709
<i>all together showing their willingness
to fight for peace and prosperity.</i>

01:11:25.876 --> 01:11:29.709
<i>Above their heads, red flags
and red-and-white flags.</i>

01:11:30.084 --> 01:11:35.459
<i>Watched over by the portraits of Dzerzhinsky,
Marchlewski, Kasprzak, Warynski,</i>

01:11:36.251 --> 01:11:40.209
<i>their great predecessors
in the battle for social liberation.</i>

01:12:09.209 --> 01:12:10.167
Mr. Strzemienski...

01:12:13.542 --> 01:12:15.709
- Strzeminski.
- You're wanted at payroll.

01:12:38.959 --> 01:12:42.459
I'm sorry, but I am forced to let you go
with immediate effect.

01:12:45.959 --> 01:12:46.792
Yes...

01:12:49.084 --> 01:12:50.667
Please, do sit down.

01:12:57.251 --> 01:13:00.626
It's not your fault.
However...

01:13:00.792 --> 01:13:02.792
May I ask why?

01:13:03.042 --> 01:13:04.417
I did something wrong?

01:13:05.001 --> 01:13:06.417
No, you did nothing wrong...

01:13:06.584 --> 01:13:10.042
On the contrary, you were
the best worker in the studio.

01:13:10.292 --> 01:13:12.459
The others were even
fighting over your work.

01:13:13.501 --> 01:13:15.584
Polish Railways wanted
to take you from us permanently.

01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:20.376
But unfortunately we got
an anonymous letter,

01:13:20.584 --> 01:13:22.626
that you don't have
the papers to be an artist.

01:13:22.792 --> 01:13:26.209
We checked at the
Association of Polish Artists and Designers.

01:13:26.834 --> 01:13:28.542
And indeed your privileges
have been revoked.

01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:31.084
It's our obligation now.
Here you go.

01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:39.834
Never mind the money,
but I won't have the food stamps.

01:13:40.084 --> 01:13:41.459
Haven't you heard?

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:44.542
In Communism,
those who don't work shall not eat...

01:13:45.417 --> 01:13:48.167
I wonder what will happen with them...

01:13:48.834 --> 01:13:49.959
I will find out.

01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:54.334
Personally, I admire your work.

01:13:56.376 --> 01:13:58.167
That Neoplastic Room...

01:14:04.876 --> 01:14:06.834
Have you really met Marc Chagall?

01:14:16.959 --> 01:14:19.751
I'll go to the studio to get my things.

01:14:47.251 --> 01:14:48.501
I'll wait here.

01:14:58.001 --> 01:14:59.501
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:14:59.709 --> 01:15:02.542
Can I have some oils and tempera?

01:15:03.376 --> 01:15:04.376
Right away.

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:07.751
We sell oils at 80.

01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:10.917
No, so tempera then, please.

01:15:12.417 --> 01:15:13.751
We have tempera at 12.

01:15:14.501 --> 01:15:15.584
But we also have some at 8.

01:15:16.542 --> 01:15:19.917
From those at 8,
can I have burnt sienna,

01:15:22.042 --> 01:15:24.834
bright ochre, golden ochre,

01:15:26.834 --> 01:15:28.542
Parisian blue,

01:15:29.751 --> 01:15:30.667
and titanium white?

01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:31.959
Right.

01:15:35.667 --> 01:15:37.459
Parisian blue...

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:40.417
Can I see your membership ID, please?

01:15:41.459 --> 01:15:42.667
I don't have one.

01:15:44.959 --> 01:15:47.042
Then I can't sell you any paints.

01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:50.459
Have they gone crazy?
I've been buying here for years!

01:15:50.834 --> 01:15:54.501
Sir, this is a shop for artists
and you don't have the ID.

01:16:04.417 --> 01:16:06.126
Now we have some for the cinema.

01:16:15.084 --> 01:16:21.542
<i>"Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Speaks
At the Putiiov Metalworks in 1917",</i>

01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:26.126
<i>a painting by artists Serov,
Podkovyrin and Belayev.</i>

01:16:27.876 --> 01:16:34.459
<i>"The Smolny Revolution Headquarters"
by Leningrad artist Babasuk.</i>

01:16:35.334 --> 01:16:42.417
<i>"For the Rule of the Soviets" called his work
sculptor Faidish-Krandievski from Moscow.</i>

01:16:52.251 --> 01:16:56.417
<i>"The New Apartment" by artist Laktionov.</i>

01:16:59.084 --> 01:17:02.584
<i>A series of lithographs
by young artist Pinkisevitch.</i>

01:17:02.959 --> 01:17:08.376
- We made a bad choice.
- <i>"Where the Capitalist Predators Rule."</i>

01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:11.292
<i>"In New York."</i>

01:17:12.626 --> 01:17:14.584
<i>"In West Germany."</i>

01:17:16.209 --> 01:17:18.251
<i>"On the Roads of India."</i>

01:17:27.459 --> 01:17:29.126
Why did we leave before the movie?

01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:31.626
You always liked the cinema.

01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:44.459
You need new shoes.

01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:47.542
- I'll give you the money.
- There's no need.

01:17:47.834 --> 01:17:51.542
We'll get new shoes at the girls' home.
They promised us.

01:18:28.459 --> 01:18:29.792
Sir...

01:18:30.917 --> 01:18:32.709
You don't need to queue.

01:18:44.917 --> 01:18:46.209
And for you?

01:18:46.584 --> 01:18:48.376
100g of that.

01:18:48.542 --> 01:18:49.751
And the stamps?

01:18:51.917 --> 01:18:53.751
- I haven't got any...
- Next!

01:18:54.126 --> 01:18:56.792
- I haven't worked for 6 months...
- Next!

01:18:57.126 --> 01:18:58.667
Yes?

01:19:00.376 --> 01:19:01.792
- Any giblets left?
- Yes.

01:19:01.959 --> 01:19:03.126
200g.

01:19:14.292 --> 01:19:15.417
May I?

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:18.001
- It's almost midnight...
- Time for conspirators.

01:19:18.209 --> 01:19:19.126
Come in...

01:19:23.084 --> 01:19:23.959
Are you going away?

01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:28.667
Didn't you think I was moving in, Professor?

01:19:29.834 --> 01:19:30.876
For a moment...

01:19:31.959 --> 01:19:34.876
- And would that be so strange?
- Absurd.

01:19:39.042 --> 01:19:40.709
- So you haven't returned it?
- No.

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:43.667
Why not, for God's sake?
Roman was thrown out of school for that.

01:19:44.001 --> 01:19:46.584
Also thrown out of the Party
as the son of a pre-war governor.

01:19:46.876 --> 01:19:49.292
In fact, as my accomplice
he knew about everything.

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:53.084
It was good for him, he may turn out
a decent person, and not a red dirtbag.

01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:54.209
But why?

01:19:54.626 --> 01:19:57.376
Because he respects
and admires you above all else

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:59.959
and I have to complete your life's work.

01:20:01.001 --> 01:20:03.542
I love you, ever since
I saw you on that field trip.

01:20:08.292 --> 01:20:10.334
Well...

01:20:10.667 --> 01:20:13.376
And I thought that
it couldn't get any worse.

01:21:31.626 --> 01:21:33.709
So, Mr. Strzeminski?

01:21:34.084 --> 01:21:35.917
We meet again.

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:38.626
You called me here.

01:21:42.959 --> 01:21:44.042
Mr. Strzeminski...

01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:48.001
we agreed once that
you're standing at a crossroads

01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:50.626
and that you cannot stay there any longer.

01:21:54.959 --> 01:21:56.542
We have arrested that student of yours.

01:21:57.667 --> 01:22:02.126
That typewriter was also used
for anti-government leaflets.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:06.417
I assure you that we have
ways of making her tell us everything.

01:22:08.417 --> 01:22:09.709
You can help her,

01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:13.292
and I can help you.

01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:16.334
I will provide you
with a studio in the School,

01:22:17.251 --> 01:22:20.292
conditions for creative work,
exhibitions and publications.

01:22:21.834 --> 01:22:22.959
Existence.

01:22:26.084 --> 01:22:27.667
You'll take care of your daughter.

01:22:32.501 --> 01:22:36.126
And what you have to offer...

01:22:37.667 --> 01:22:38.667
what is it?

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.042
I don't know...

01:23:02.501 --> 01:23:07.126
With the last two months
which you owe,

01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:10.459
altogether it's 1,400.

01:23:10.959 --> 01:23:13.001
I'm sorry, but I don't have any...

01:23:22.542 --> 01:23:25.751
When you pay up, then we'll talk.

01:23:29.292 --> 01:23:31.792
I don't shit money, sir.

01:24:50.042 --> 01:24:51.459
He's had a few too many.

01:25:00.834 --> 01:25:01.917
Sir?

01:25:02.792 --> 01:25:04.209
Are you alright?

01:25:04.459 --> 01:25:05.501
Do you need some help?

01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:07.376
Sir?

01:25:08.751 --> 01:25:10.751
I'll call an ambulance!

01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:18.584
- Where's the phone?
- There.

01:25:20.876 --> 01:25:22.876
Excuse me, I need
to call an ambulance.

01:25:23.042 --> 01:25:23.751
Go ahead.

01:25:32.792 --> 01:25:33.959
To the drunk tank?

01:25:34.292 --> 01:25:36.251
To the hospital,
it's serious.

01:25:44.959 --> 01:25:46.917
Don't forget the crutches!

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:22.084
Julian...

01:26:22.667 --> 01:26:26.126
My days are numbered. I'm dying.

01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:33.834
I'd like to have a few more months
to complete the "Theory of Vision"...

01:26:35.542 --> 01:26:36.542
A couple of weeks...

01:26:38.001 --> 01:26:39.792
So I can leave something behind...

01:26:42.792 --> 01:26:43.917
It's good you're here...

01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:46.209
Show me your shoes. Come on.

01:26:51.167 --> 01:26:52.084
First one.

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:56.042
Second one.

01:26:56.501 --> 01:26:57.792
They don't leak?

01:27:30.792 --> 01:27:33.042
When he saw those shoes,

01:27:33.209 --> 01:27:36.334
- he was so glad!
- A friend lent me those for the visit.

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:37.626
And the dress.

01:27:38.667 --> 01:27:40.709
So he wouldn't worry about me...

01:27:42.459 --> 01:27:44.459
But don't tell him that, sir.

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:45.667
Doctor!

01:27:47.542 --> 01:27:48.709
I've got some Rimifon.

01:27:49.751 --> 01:27:51.417
How did you get it?

01:27:51.584 --> 01:27:54.542
- It's not available here...
- I visit Switzerland.

01:27:57.417 --> 01:27:58.292
We'll use it...

01:27:58.834 --> 01:27:59.917
but...

01:28:00.834 --> 01:28:03.292
I'm afraid it's too late for that...

01:28:05.167 --> 01:28:06.584
Excuse me.

01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:29.001
What are you doing?

01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:32.917
- You have to stay...
- No.

01:28:33.084 --> 01:28:34.626
Not now... Not yet.

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:38.292
Professor, you have advanced tuberculosis.
It's no joke.

01:28:38.792 --> 01:28:41.126
I have something important to do...

01:30:01.459 --> 01:30:03.084
Move in with me.

01:30:04.417 --> 01:30:05.917
From your place it's too far.

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:08.667
From Karolewska it's closer to school.

01:30:12.792 --> 01:30:15.834
Nobody visits me anymore.

01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:29.001
The 67 paintings that you gave me in 1945
for the first exhibition

01:30:29.126 --> 01:30:31.209
are here in storage.

01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:32.917
I will put these here too.

01:30:34.001 --> 01:30:35.292
They will be safe.

01:30:36.959 --> 01:30:40.167
Safe, but no one will see them here...

01:30:42.334 --> 01:30:46.501
Sir, I will take any job...

01:30:47.667 --> 01:30:49.084
We have to live somehow...

01:30:52.126 --> 01:30:54.584
Mr. Wladyslaw, I know the situation, but...

01:30:55.042 --> 01:30:56.459
I can't.

01:30:58.417 --> 01:30:59.709
I'd love to, but I can't...

01:30:59.917 --> 01:31:01.876
Please believe me. I can't.

01:31:28.584 --> 01:31:29.417
Good morning.

01:31:33.501 --> 01:31:36.209
- Who have you sent me here?
- Here you are.

01:31:36.834 --> 01:31:38.542
But he isn't up to it!

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:42.001
- Madam, he's a specialist.
- A specialist!

01:31:42.376 --> 01:31:45.042
- No leg, no arm, a specialist!
- Please!

01:31:45.167 --> 01:31:47.376
A specialist! In limping maybe!

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:56.917
26 December 1952

01:34:07.251 --> 01:34:08.251
Yes?

01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:13.084
Can I stay here for a while?

01:34:13.292 --> 01:34:14.959
What is it, child?

01:34:18.292 --> 01:34:20.709
My father died on this bed.

01:34:21.834 --> 01:34:24.292
His name was Wladyslaw Strzeminski.

01:34:26.542 --> 01:34:27.667
Of course.
