How's it going?

00:51.942 --> 00:53.341
Hey.

00:53.342 --> 00:55.391
It's been pretty non-stop.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.014
Let me get this to you now.

00:59.008 --> 01:00.761
You know, some of Stacy's
friends are having

01:00.762 --> 01:02.274
a party over at Logan Square tonight.

01:02.275 --> 01:03.307
You want to come?

01:03.308 --> 01:04.714
Does Stacy want me to come?

01:04.715 --> 01:06.427
Yeah, she's the one who
asked me to invite you.

01:06.428 --> 01:08.127
You should come.

01:08.128 --> 01:09.927
You'd really like her.
She's pretty incredible.

01:09.928 --> 01:11.994
Did you tell her about us?

01:12.460 --> 01:15.154
Not yet. But I'm sure she'll
understand, it's in the past.

01:16.628 --> 01:18.794
Don't be naive.

01:18.795 --> 01:21.061
Cash it soon.

01:21.062 --> 01:23.061
You're so cynical.

01:23.062 --> 01:24.695
See ya.

01:27.061 --> 01:31.060
I want you to amend claim 32.

01:31.061 --> 01:32.599
Hold on.

01:33.261 --> 01:36.127
You've got great organizational skills.

01:36.128 --> 01:37.594
It's all up here.

01:37.595 --> 01:39.561
I know where everything is.

01:39.562 --> 01:43.761
I'm hearing some rumors...

01:43.762 --> 01:44.761

but I actually enjoy it.

I like having sex.

This woman, Jacqueline,
vets them for me,

02:41.194 --> 02:43.193
and takes care of the bookings.

02:43.194 --> 02:44.326
Why? Do you want to meet her?

02:44.327 --> 02:47.193
I could introduce you, if you want.

02:47.194 --> 02:49.193
No, just curious.

02:49.194 --> 02:51.060
Okay.

02:51.061 --> 02:53.060
But there's a difference
between being curious

02:53.061 --> 02:55.260
and actually following through.

02:55.261 --> 02:56.860
I'm aware of that.

02:56.861 --> 02:59.860
If you meet Jacqueline, she's
gonna wanna book for you.

02:59.861 --> 03:02.193
You're smart and hot and funny.

03:02.194 --> 03:04.359
You just have to want to do it.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.526
I mean I get off on it.
I like the rush...

03:06.527 --> 03:09.093
All the attention, knowing he wants me.

03:09.094 --> 03:10.760
Then there's the money.

03:10.761 --> 03:11.993
And at the end of the day,

03:11.994 --> 03:13.260
if I don't get along with a client,

03:13.261 --> 03:14.760
I just move on.

03:14.761 --> 03:18.593
All I really have to do is
listen and ask questions.

03:18.594 --> 03:20.360
And fuck?

03:20.361 --> 03:22.126
Yeah.

Me, too.

04:44.494 --> 04:45.626
You look beautiful.

04:45.627 --> 04:47.459
Thank you.

04:47.460 --> 04:51.193
No, it's interesting because
we have some sizable estates,

04:51.194 --> 04:53.260
and there's no better sport

04:53.261 --> 04:55.493
than watching the wealthy try
to hang onto their money.

04:55.494 --> 04:57.193

It just never gets old.

04:59.827 --> 05:01.493
Really?

05:01.494 --> 05:03.728

05:04.727 --> 05:05.587
Not yet.

05:05.588 --> 05:07.726
And I've been doing this for 20 years.

05:07.727 --> 05:09.267
Huh.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.794
Do you have a lawyer?

05:10.795 --> 05:12.147
Me? No.

05:12.148 --> 05:14.614
Seriously? You should.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.747
You can be my lawyer.

05:16.748 --> 05:18.748
I would happily be your lawyer,

05:18.749 --> 05:20.614
but then...

05:20.615 --> 05:22.381
this would have to stop.

05:22.382 --> 05:24.681

Federal Circuit has a monopoly
on all patent appeals.

09:18.939 --> 09:20.605
It was established by Ronald Reagan and

09:20.606 --> 09:22.371
is hardly met a patent it doesn't like.

interpreting patent code,

then every later judge is
obliged to follow their ruling.

Yes.

I do realize it's the result of
years of hard work and school,

09:37.439 --> 09:39.505
and that's your passion.

09:39.506 --> 09:41.337

09:42.405 --> 09:43.946

09:44.539 --> 09:46.218
At least from this end.

it, the more they will too.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.104

Why would I go with you
when I can do this myself?

12:23.705 --> 12:25.237

Yeah.

Well, it's just math really.

12:28.838 --> 12:30.970

12:30.971 --> 12:34.704
The hours that you would spend
finding and then vetting clients

12:34.705 --> 12:38.237

14:53.703 --> 14:55.359
But I'd like to use a condom.

14:56.203 --> 14:57.802
Yeah, I don't have any.

14:57.803 --> 14:58.803
I do.

15:01.803 --> 15:03.169
Let's go to the bathroom.

15:14.069 --> 15:16.002
(HEAVY, EROTIC BREATHING)

15:21.236 --> 15:23.002
(SOUND OF PLASTIC WRAPPER)

15:42.036 --> 15:44.136
(PASSIONATE SIGHING)

15:58.303 --> 15:59.569
Face me.

16:08.936 --> 16:10.402
Perfect.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.035
Just like that.

16:12.036 --> 16:13.202
Fuck.

16:13.203 --> 16:15.136
(SHORT, QUICK EROTIC BREATHING)

16:19.869 --> 16:21.102
(SOUND OF MAN CLIMAXING)

16:28.336 --> 16:29.402
Water is included.

16:29.403 --> 16:31.935
Electric would be separate.

16:31.936 --> 16:33.235
Take your time.

16:41.136 --> 16:42.702
I think this place is great for you.

16:47.003 --> 16:48.303
It's too expensive.

16:50.436 --> 16:52.069
I can't afford this.

16:55.169 --> 16:56.848
What if I cover the deposit?

16:58.569 --> 17:00.531
And if you keep working,

17:00.936 --> 17:02.636
it'll figure itself out.

17:08.702 --> 17:12.137
Emery, this is part of the process.

17:13.136 --> 17:15.795
I'm not trying to manipulate you!

17:16.336 --> 17:18.768
I'm sure that when you come down...

17:18.769 --> 17:22.105
Hey, we're doing
everything we fucking can!

17:23.202 --> 17:24.335
Hello?

17:26.375 --> 17:27.375
Shit!

17:27.740 --> 17:29.473
We already gave you a chance.

17:29.474 --> 17:31.139
This is how things move.

17:31.140 --> 17:33.846
Don't fucking lecture
me on how things move!

17:33.847 --> 17:34.653
Three mistrials.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.886
Three fucking mistrials, David.

17:36.887 --> 17:38.654
Explain to me why I need
to hear anything else

17:38.655 --> 17:40.647
out of your mouth other
than you fucked up.

17:40.648 --> 17:42.913
This is not the time to switch counsel.

17:42.914 --> 17:46.388
You will lose if Kersner
sees you have doubts.

17:46.389 --> 17:47.689
Do you get that?

17:47.690 --> 17:49.119
I think what David is trying to say...

17:49.120 --> 17:51.244
I don't need to hear the same
goddamn words in a different tone.

17:51.245 --> 17:53.820
I completely understand where
you are coming from, Emery.

17:53.821 --> 17:55.920
We, or maybe I should
just speak for myself,

17:55.921 --> 17:58.820
I just want to know how to fix this.

17:58.821 --> 18:00.588
How do you see this moving forward?

18:02.889 --> 18:05.387
He didn't say. I don't know.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.220
Maybe his wife's coming to town or

18:07.221 --> 18:10.020
maybe he's just not
that into me anymore.

18:10.021 --> 18:13.120
Either way, I have to pack
up my shit and leave.

18:13.121 --> 18:16.954
It's really not that big a deal.

18:16.955 --> 18:19.754
Just stay with me until
you figure it out.

18:19.755 --> 18:21.955
Maybe Jacqueline can lend you
money. She charges enough.

18:25.155 --> 18:27.020
How much are you paying her?

18:27.021 --> 18:28.754
Same as you...

18:28.755 --> 18:30.022
30%.

18:32.855 --> 18:34.254
Kind of steep, no?

18:34.255 --> 18:36.150
Yeah, but it's pretty standard.

18:36.822 --> 18:38.220
Why, you don't like her?

18:38.221 --> 18:40.320
No, she's great, I just...

18:40.321 --> 18:42.320
30%'s a lot.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.887
That's all.

18:43.888 --> 18:45.645
You can tell me if you don't like her.

18:47.055 --> 18:48.321
I like her.

18:53.155 --> 18:54.887
Don't tell her I said anything.

18:54.888 --> 18:56.222
Of course.

19:05.989 --> 19:07.987
(SOUND OF FRONT DOOR CLOSING)

19:07.988 --> 19:10.120
So, you can sleep in here.

19:10.121 --> 19:13.224
Obviously, I haven't slept in
it, but it seems comfortable.

19:15.922 --> 19:20.020
Ahhh, if you need to do
your laundry, it's the...

19:20.021 --> 19:22.320
closet right next to the kitchen.

19:22.321 --> 19:23.488
Yeah.

19:37.489 --> 19:39.321
This place is really nice.

19:39.322 --> 19:41.187
Yeah.

19:41.188 --> 19:44.654
Still getting used to it, but I like it.

19:44.655 --> 19:46.987
How much do you pay for it?

19:46.988 --> 19:49.254
Probably too much.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.021
Don't you have loans to pay off?

19:51.022 --> 19:53.655
Yeah, Jacqueline actually put the
deposit down, so that helps.

19:54.922 --> 19:57.054
So you can take "in calls"?

19:57.055 --> 19:59.254
No, I am paying her back.
She was just helping.

19:59.255 --> 20:01.054
Oh.

20:01.055 --> 20:02.321
Here.

20:02.322 --> 20:04.145
Just pay me back when you have it.

20:04.146 --> 20:05.762
I have credit cards, I'm fine.

20:06.613 --> 20:08.510
Speaking of which, let's go to lunch.

20:09.579 --> 20:11.611
It's on me, it's the least I could do.

20:11.612 --> 20:15.245
We'll have the forest
mushrooms, the kale salad,

20:15.246 --> 20:20.212
the ahi tuna tartare, diver
scallops and two mimosas...

20:20.213 --> 20:21.380
Please.

20:23.279 --> 20:24.712
Thanks.

20:24.713 --> 20:27.478
(MUFFLED SOUNDS OF UPSCALE RESTAURANT)

20:27.479 --> 20:29.611
You deserve it.

20:29.612 --> 20:30.879
We deserve it.

20:33.079 --> 20:34.752
So how is work?

20:34.753 --> 20:36.345
Which work?

20:36.346 --> 20:37.678
I'm currently burning a
candle at three ends,

20:37.679 --> 20:39.611
which I didn't know was possible.

20:39.612 --> 20:41.245
Maybe one should go.

20:41.246 --> 20:43.212
Yeah, maybe.

20:43.213 --> 20:44.745
For now, it's fun.

20:44.746 --> 20:47.858
And have you noticed that
people are fucking insane?

20:56.446 --> 20:57.712
(SOUND OF CELL PHONE BUZZING)

21:02.412 --> 21:03.711
Hello.

21:03.712 --> 21:05.778
Christine. Hi, it's Jacqueline.

21:05.779 --> 21:08.511
Listen, I have someone
I'd love you to meet.

21:08.512 --> 21:09.912
Are you free for lunch on Thursday?

21:09.913 --> 21:11.648
Yeah, I can make that work.

21:12.913 --> 21:14.788
I'm so sorry to hear that.

21:16.313 --> 21:17.778
When did she pass away?

21:17.779 --> 21:19.725
It's been eleven months now.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.445
That's gotta be hard.

21:23.446 --> 21:25.492
I think it's been harder on the kids.

21:26.479 --> 21:27.678
Are you close to them?

21:27.679 --> 21:28.645
I was...

21:28.646 --> 21:30.368
Least I think I was.

21:32.319 --> 21:34.219
But they're adults now.

21:37.779 --> 21:39.512
They've got their own lives.

21:41.812 --> 21:45.811
Why it's so nice to spend time
with someone and just talk.

21:45.812 --> 21:47.745
Especially to a...

21:47.746 --> 21:50.612
to a beautiful young woman.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.178
We can talk whenever you like.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.545
(SOUND OF CELL PHONE BUZZING)

21:57.579 --> 21:58.779
Jacqueline?

22:00.679 --> 22:03.278
Oh, she-she's wonderful.

22:03.279 --> 22:05.512
We're having a really
nice time together.

22:08.046 --> 22:09.479
Declined?

22:11.546 --> 22:12.730
Well, that's surprising.

22:14.013 --> 22:15.412
Yeah.

22:15.413 --> 22:16.421
Hang on.

22:17.613 --> 22:19.480
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

22:23.879 --> 22:25.545
Okay...

Christine...

23:55.974 --> 23:57.190
What is it?

23:57.574 --> 23:59.264
Was having problems sleeping.

24:00.541 --> 24:02.708
I'm really sorry, I shouldn't
have brought him here.

24:05.907 --> 24:07.740
Can I lie down beside you?

24:07.741 --> 24:08.941
Yeah.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.564
I'm sorry, I should have asked.

24:23.541 --> 24:25.304
I can give you half for letting me.

24:25.908 --> 24:28.836
- I'll give you $500.
- I don't want your money.

24:29.441 --> 24:31.573
Jacqueline won't call me back.

24:31.574 --> 24:34.373
- She won't tell me why.
- Go to sleep.

24:34.374 --> 24:36.506
I have to get up at six in the morning.

24:36.507 --> 24:38.574
Oh really? Fuck, I'm sorry.

24:54.307 --> 24:55.940
You're really warm.

25:01.274 --> 25:03.406
Thank you for being there for me.

25:03.407 --> 25:04.907
Of course.

25:21.741 --> 25:23.074
Kiss me.
