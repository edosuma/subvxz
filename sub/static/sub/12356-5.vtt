Maya Lindholm.
Boom. There it is.

DOUG: Now we just have to get
them to officially come to terms.

00:21.899 --> 00:24.065
I have an idea for an app.
It's basically Uber,

00:24.117 --> 00:25.450
but with doctors.
With doctors.

00:25.485 --> 00:26.485
Kind of brilliant, Kelse.

00:26.486 --> 00:27.452
What if I came on board?

00:27.487 --> 00:28.904
Oh...

00:28.956 --> 00:31.206
I made a solemn vow, like,
six months ago not to date

Thank you, Auntie Denna.

That was a little creepy,

01:30.467 --> 01:32.350
Hey, uh, any chance
of Auntie Denna bidding

01:32.386 --> 01:34.519
on that Aspen ski trip
in the silent auction

01:34.554 --> 01:36.104
for destitute little Dougie?

01:36.139 --> 01:38.223
No. That's too far.
I get it. I'm sorry.

01:38.275 --> 01:40.976
You know, we should be
holding a fundraiser for us.

01:40.978 --> 01:42.277
(chuckles)
No. We'll be fine.

01:42.312 --> 01:44.195
As soon as this merger
goes through,

01:44.231 --> 01:47.282
we will be back
to buying our own caviar

01:47.317 --> 01:49.484
in support
of starving children everywhere.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.457
I'm eating for two now, asshole.

01:55.492 --> 01:57.208
Two what?

01:57.244 --> 01:59.661
Hey, Marty, you made it.

01:59.713 --> 02:01.830
And you brought Denna Altshuler.

02:01.832 --> 02:03.498
Wow, I am impressed.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.800
Any chance you'll be donating

02:05.836 --> 02:08.836
some of last year's
crude oil earnings to the kids?

02:08.889 --> 02:11.056
Ah, gosh, kind of got
that money earmarked

02:11.091 --> 02:12.424
for this giant blood diamond

02:12.476 --> 02:14.175
that caught my eye,
but... we'll see.

02:14.227 --> 02:15.977
(laughs)
Jeannie,

02:16.013 --> 02:19.898
wow, you are absolutely glowing.

02:19.933 --> 02:21.433
I'm a bloated sack of meat

02:21.485 --> 02:23.268
stuffed into a cocktail dress,
but thank you.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.319
CHILD:
Mom!

02:24.354 --> 02:27.022
(laughs)
You know, I envy you.

02:27.074 --> 02:29.908
Becoming a mother for
the very first time.

02:29.943 --> 02:33.695
Wow, your heart is just
about to open right up.

02:33.697 --> 02:35.997
It-it makes you
selfless

02:36.033 --> 02:38.416
in the most...
beautiful ways

02:38.452 --> 02:40.035
you never dreamed possible.

02:40.037 --> 02:42.370
CHILD: Num num!
Hey, sweetheart!

02:42.422 --> 02:44.422
All righty!

02:44.458 --> 02:45.924
Whee!

02:45.959 --> 02:48.009
Good job! There you go.
Ew.

02:48.045 --> 02:49.294
Some num nums.

02:49.346 --> 02:51.429
That's nice.
Yeah,

02:51.465 --> 02:52.764
it is.

02:52.799 --> 02:55.967
Speaking of selfless,
where the fuck is Ellis?

02:56.019 --> 02:58.219
I thought I made it clear
I expected his support today.

02:58.271 --> 03:00.105
Oh, you did, you did, and, uh,

03:00.140 --> 03:01.606
I assure you Ellis is

03:01.641 --> 03:02.941
fully supportive.

03:02.976 --> 03:04.559
Well, Ellis saying
he supports me

03:04.611 --> 03:06.144
is one thing, but actually

03:06.196 --> 03:08.279
showing up is quite another.
Hey, Jeannie, can you...

03:08.315 --> 03:10.448
Yeah, I'm gonna make
a phone call right now.

03:10.484 --> 03:11.983
JEANNIE:
Uh, excuse me.

03:12.035 --> 03:14.069
I hope nothing bad happened to him.
(Maya laughs)

03:14.121 --> 03:15.537
Trust me, it hasn't.

03:15.572 --> 03:17.155
Oh, I'm sure he's on the way.

03:17.207 --> 03:18.623
Awesome.
And if things

03:18.658 --> 03:22.210
don't work out with Ellis, maybe
you can find me another one

03:22.245 --> 03:24.329
of your prison buddies
to partner with.

03:25.415 --> 03:27.966
Okay, Maya.

03:28.001 --> 03:29.718
Wow.

03:29.753 --> 03:32.087
Earth Mother's got fangs.

03:32.089 --> 03:33.671
Nice tits, though.

03:33.724 --> 03:35.390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was just thinking that.

03:35.425 --> 03:36.424
No way around that.

03:36.476 --> 03:39.310
Hey, Ellis, it's Jeannie again.

03:39.346 --> 03:41.096
Please give me a call
when you get this.

03:41.148 --> 03:42.480
It's very important. Thanks.

03:42.516 --> 03:43.932
Bye.
Anything?

03:43.934 --> 03:45.984
Let me call from your phone.

03:46.019 --> 03:47.902
I guess I did slap him around
pretty good.

03:47.938 --> 03:49.070
(scoffs) You think?

03:49.106 --> 03:51.439
Yeah, I, uh,
meant to mention that to you.

03:51.441 --> 03:52.774
You do understand that's not

03:52.826 --> 03:54.159
an acceptable
parenting technique, right?

03:54.194 --> 03:55.944
Didn't you hear Maya?

03:55.946 --> 03:59.447
My heart is about
to open right up.

03:59.449 --> 04:01.116
Plop.
Yeah.

04:01.118 --> 04:02.617
(line ringing)

04:02.669 --> 04:05.086
ELLIS: Marty, you need
to call off your dogs.

04:05.122 --> 04:06.504
Ellis, it's the dog.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.590
Listen, we're all at
Maya's charity event.

04:08.625 --> 04:09.791
Yeah, I'm not coming to that.

04:09.843 --> 04:11.042
Kind of swamped with work.

04:11.094 --> 04:12.677
Well, we talked about this.

04:12.712 --> 04:14.012
Maya really wants you here.

04:14.047 --> 04:15.797
And I want to be able
to run my company

04:15.799 --> 04:17.464
without her interference,
but that's not happening.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.801
I'm letting her come back,
so I think I've done enough.

04:19.853 --> 04:21.435
If anything,
she's the one who should be

04:21.471 --> 04:23.271
bending over backwards
to support my charities.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.606
You don't have any charities.

04:24.641 --> 04:26.641
That's because philanthropy
is bullshit.

04:26.693 --> 04:28.610
Ever heard of H.L. Mencken?

04:28.645 --> 04:30.645
He said,
"The urge to save humanity

04:30.647 --> 04:34.115
is almost always a false front
for the urge to rule."

04:34.151 --> 04:36.367
Ok... oh, listen, Ellis,
that's not anything...

04:36.403 --> 04:37.702
No, you listen!
I've done enough

04:37.737 --> 04:39.654
Maya ass-kissing
for one lifetime.

04:39.706 --> 04:41.289
If anyone's ass here deserves
to be kissed, it's mine.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.407
Not her ass.

04:42.459 --> 04:44.325
My ass. Mine!
(snapping fingers)

04:44.377 --> 04:47.162
You know what, your ass is
not gonna be kissed, Ellis.

04:47.214 --> 04:48.663
It's not. Do you know why?

04:48.665 --> 04:51.082
Because there is a crisis
of confidence at Gage.

04:51.134 --> 04:52.300
Maya is the solution.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.552
Do you have any idea
what would happen

04:54.588 --> 04:56.838
if she decides not to go through
with this merger?

04:56.890 --> 04:58.673
Your stock prices will plummet,

04:58.675 --> 04:59.891
your board will revolt,

04:59.926 --> 05:02.177
and you will be voted
out of your own company.

05:02.179 --> 05:04.262
Because, as much
as your fragile fucking ego

05:04.314 --> 05:05.930
hates to admit it,

05:05.982 --> 05:07.315
you've never been
more successful

05:07.350 --> 05:09.234
than when the two of you
have worked together.

05:09.269 --> 05:11.903
So, please, stop being a pussy,

05:11.938 --> 05:15.657
and put the bullshit of the past
behind you, and just get here.

05:19.613 --> 05:21.112
(mouthing)

05:22.666 --> 05:24.415
And I promise
I won't hit you again.

05:24.451 --> 05:26.284
I'd like to talk
to Marty, please.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.372
Subtle.

05:31.424 --> 05:33.424
(chuckling):
Hey, hey, buddy.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.459
Marty, what the fuck?

05:34.511 --> 05:35.627
Okay, listen, listen.

05:35.679 --> 05:37.679
That was Jeannie
with the bad news.

05:37.714 --> 05:39.214
Now, are you ready
for the good news?

05:39.266 --> 05:40.765
Because it is very good.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.967
We are on the verge

05:43.019 --> 05:44.719
of getting everything
that you want.

05:44.771 --> 05:46.020
Everything that you deserve.

05:46.056 --> 05:48.056
We just need to keep Maya happy

05:48.058 --> 05:49.691
until those merger papers
are signed.

05:49.726 --> 05:51.226
So please, just get down here.

05:51.228 --> 05:52.861
Shake some hands.

05:52.896 --> 05:54.696
Make a big, fat contribution.

05:54.731 --> 05:57.232
And, you know,
just do what you do best.

05:57.284 --> 05:59.317
Impress the hell
out of everybody.

06:00.871 --> 06:02.871
I'll be there in 20.

06:06.710 --> 06:08.409
Oh, he's-he's coming.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.744
Okay.

06:09.796 --> 06:11.579
Let's just stay positive.

06:11.631 --> 06:13.498
Oh, positive? He's coming!

06:13.550 --> 06:15.500
He's coming! He's coming!

06:16.803 --> 06:19.921
How much more positive
can that get?

06:19.973 --> 06:21.422
So I'm gonna start
saying numbers,

06:21.474 --> 06:23.341
and you tell me
when to stop, all right?

06:23.393 --> 06:25.677
Clyde, I stopped breast-feeding
at an appropriate age,

06:25.729 --> 06:27.929
so let's drop it.
Of course, of course, of course.

06:27.981 --> 06:29.931
One? Two?

06:29.933 --> 06:31.432
I'm not engaging in
this conversation.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.901
Three?
(chuckles)

06:32.936 --> 06:34.769
Four? Doug, were you four?
I'm not...

06:34.771 --> 06:36.487
I'm not engaging.
Five?!

06:36.523 --> 06:38.239
Were you breast-feeding at five years old?
Oh, my God.

06:38.275 --> 06:39.741
Of course I wasn't
breast-feeding at five.

06:39.776 --> 06:40.942
That's insane.
Of course.

06:40.994 --> 06:42.527
So it was four.

06:42.579 --> 06:44.539
Oh, my God!
I'm not engaging in this conversation.

06:44.547 --> 06:45.914
I told you that.
That is so old.

06:45.949 --> 06:47.198
That's ridiculous.
Hey, sorry I'm late.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.700
Flight was delayed.
What'd I miss?

06:48.752 --> 06:50.113
Bully just tricked
the gullible one

06:50.120 --> 06:51.753
into admitting he breast-fed
till he was four.

06:51.788 --> 06:53.288
I'm Kelsey.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.872
Denna.

06:54.925 --> 06:56.758
That's a Chanel dress
you're wearing.

06:56.793 --> 06:57.875
Least it used to be.

06:57.928 --> 06:59.544
Okay.
Why would you spend thousands

06:59.596 --> 07:01.346
on a dress just
to cut holes in it?

07:01.381 --> 07:04.015
I didn't spend thousands.
My mother did.

07:04.050 --> 07:05.550
Ah.

07:05.602 --> 07:07.936
This dress really
cost thousands?

07:07.971 --> 07:09.554
Fuck.

07:09.606 --> 07:11.272
So, Denna...
Okay, Marty.

07:11.308 --> 07:13.725
- Oh, my God. - You're probably wondering
what Kelsey is doing here.

07:13.777 --> 07:15.560
Well, as you know, we're
exploring the possibility

07:15.612 --> 07:17.478
of a telecommunications
venture...

07:17.480 --> 07:19.480
Kelsey's here to help us secure
seed money for our start-up. Okay?

07:19.532 --> 07:21.316
Why do you two idiots
keep bringing this shit up?

07:21.368 --> 07:23.534
I'm not bringing it up.
I could give a fuck. Get out of here.

07:23.570 --> 07:25.370
I got to talk to Denna privately. Go away.
Okay.

07:25.405 --> 07:26.704
Put that to bed.
Make it faster.

07:26.740 --> 07:27.739
You're not doing it fast enough.

07:27.791 --> 07:29.040
Sure. Sure.
Go away.

07:29.075 --> 07:30.625
(clears throat)

07:30.660 --> 07:33.461
Okay, I found out something very
interesting on this consult.

07:33.496 --> 07:36.714
Maya has given partial ownership
of her company

07:36.750 --> 07:38.383
to the grad students
that work for her.

07:38.418 --> 07:40.668
Aw, that's super sweet,

07:40.720 --> 07:42.253
and profoundly stupid.

07:42.305 --> 07:44.055
So stupid.
Whoa.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.840
And I may need
to leverage that stupidity

07:45.842 --> 07:47.175
to help this merger go through.

07:47.227 --> 07:49.677
So, big oil magnates
in the Bay Area.

07:49.729 --> 07:51.512
You got anybody like
that in your Rolodex?

07:51.564 --> 07:53.348
Yeah, Cal Manchester.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.099
Cal fucking Manchester?

07:55.151 --> 07:57.185
Do you think Cal
would be interested

07:57.187 --> 07:59.404
in coming on down here
to help these starving kids?

07:59.439 --> 08:01.439
Depends on what's in it for him.

08:01.491 --> 08:03.074
How about a major setback

08:03.109 --> 08:05.410
in the mass production
of Maya's electric car?

08:05.445 --> 08:07.578
Yeah, I think he'd like that.

08:07.614 --> 08:08.579
Well, then, uh...

08:08.615 --> 08:09.947
(imitates dialing)

08:10.000 --> 08:11.699
Okay.
That was a phone sound.

08:11.751 --> 08:13.701
I know. Shh, shh, shh.
That was... Yeah.

08:15.171 --> 08:16.504
I will start us off,

08:16.539 --> 08:18.089
get them hot
with some earning projections,

08:18.124 --> 08:19.624
carried interest payouts,

08:19.676 --> 08:21.709
then you, Kelsey,
you finish them off

08:21.761 --> 08:24.012
with a little technical jargon
happy ending.

08:24.047 --> 08:25.296
Gross.

08:25.348 --> 08:27.765
(muttering):
Who died and made you Marty?

08:27.801 --> 08:28.933
I'm sorry, Douglas.
Hmm?

08:28.968 --> 08:30.385
Do you have something to say?

08:30.437 --> 08:32.220
Or do you want to stick with
the passive-aggressive mumbling?

08:32.272 --> 08:33.520
Well, I was just wondering

08:33.556 --> 08:34.972
if you've even considered
any alternatives.

08:35.025 --> 08:36.557
Oh, my God, like what?

08:36.609 --> 08:37.692
Have you pitch?

08:37.727 --> 08:38.726
Well, I mean,

08:38.778 --> 08:40.227
some people find
your presentation style

08:40.280 --> 08:41.446
a little aggressive
and off-putting.

08:41.481 --> 08:42.897
There, I said it.
Fuck you.

08:42.948 --> 08:45.066
Oh, of course.
How foolish of me to worry.

08:45.068 --> 08:46.734
"Of course.
How foolish of me to worry."

08:46.736 --> 08:48.569
Hey, I have a lot riding
on this, Clyde.

08:48.621 --> 08:50.738
You know I'm having
money issues.

08:50.740 --> 08:52.240
Holy shit.
Hmm?

08:52.292 --> 08:54.242
That's Danny Buckingham.

08:54.294 --> 08:56.494
CLYDE:
Who's Danny Buckingham?

08:56.546 --> 08:57.912
"Who's Danny Buckingham?"

08:57.964 --> 08:59.797
Creator of
easyasbuck.com.

08:59.833 --> 09:02.550
It's this Web site
that provides HTML

09:02.585 --> 09:04.719
tutorials for tweens.
It sold for, like,

09:04.754 --> 09:07.138
$65 million. One of you
should go talk to him.

09:07.173 --> 09:09.390
I will go talk to him,
and do you know why?

09:09.426 --> 09:11.642
Because, out of the three of us,
you're the most childish?

09:11.678 --> 09:13.394
(mock laughing)

09:13.430 --> 09:15.313
No. Because I can relate
to him in a way that you

09:15.348 --> 09:17.932
never could. One child prodigy to another.
Oh.

09:17.934 --> 09:20.184
Excuse me.
God. Except you were never a child prodigy.

09:20.236 --> 09:21.936
He was never a child prodigy.

09:21.938 --> 09:23.938
That's okay. That's not
really Danny Buckingham.

09:25.024 --> 09:26.190
Ah...

09:29.946 --> 09:31.996
Hey. Mr. Buckingham, hi.

09:32.031 --> 09:34.949
My name is Doug Guggenheim,
and I would like to tell you

09:34.951 --> 09:37.618
about a mobile app that's
going to revolutionize

09:37.670 --> 09:39.253
the medical industry.

09:39.289 --> 09:41.339
So, cool if I chill
with you for a sec?

09:41.374 --> 09:44.375
Okay, terrific.

09:46.763 --> 09:48.713
Hey, hey. There he is.

09:48.765 --> 09:50.131
The bigger man.

09:50.183 --> 09:51.549
The fuck is this?
What?

09:51.601 --> 09:54.268
What is this?
That's a bid sheet.

09:54.304 --> 09:55.720
It's a clipboard.

09:55.772 --> 09:57.472
Because nothing says
we're at the forefront

09:57.474 --> 10:00.024
of cutting-edge innovation
like a fucking clipboard.

10:02.562 --> 10:04.278
Maybe don't worry
so much about the clipboard.

10:04.314 --> 10:05.613
Yeah, it's just
a clipboard, Ellis.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.231
Yeah, it makes us look
antiquated by association,

10:07.283 --> 10:08.616
but that's fine.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.492
Perception's not really
important in our world.

10:11.704 --> 10:14.038
One Child, One Spirit.

10:14.073 --> 10:15.656
One gag reflex.

10:15.708 --> 10:17.542
You hear what I said,
Marty? One gag reflex.

10:17.577 --> 10:19.410
One gag...That's very funny. Very funny.
Yeah.

10:19.462 --> 10:21.746
All right, let's get this
over with. Where's Maya?

10:21.798 --> 10:24.081
She i...

10:24.134 --> 10:25.500
(clears throat) She's...

10:25.502 --> 10:27.385
Okay, look, let's just
go over and say hi.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.670
I don't need a babysitter,
Marty. I can handle Maya.

10:29.722 --> 10:32.006
Okay? I got this.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.893
He's got this.
Hmm.

10:35.929 --> 10:37.011
Ellis.

10:39.432 --> 10:42.099
(sharp inhale)
He don't got this. He don't

10:42.152 --> 10:44.018
got this.
Where's he going?

10:44.020 --> 10:46.571
It's... Just wants to...
He's excited.

10:46.606 --> 10:48.189
...say a few words.
Uh-huh.

10:48.191 --> 10:50.158
ELLIS (on microphone):
Hello, everyone.

10:50.193 --> 10:51.576
My name is Ellis Hightower.

10:51.611 --> 10:55.246
I'm the founder and CEO
of Gage Motors.

10:55.281 --> 10:57.281
Thank you.

10:59.536 --> 11:03.004
Today, I am writing a check
in the amount of $1 million

11:03.039 --> 11:05.173
to Maya's
One Child, One Spirit charity.

11:05.208 --> 11:08.960
Hey, that's good, right? That's good.
ELLIS: Yes.

11:09.012 --> 11:10.962
Yes, who wouldn't feel compelled
to applaud that?

11:11.014 --> 11:14.265
A great name for a great cause.

11:14.300 --> 11:17.018
Fantastic. Now, just step away
from the mic, buddy.

11:17.053 --> 11:19.854
You know, it was H.L. Mencken
who wrote...

11:19.889 --> 11:21.138
Jesus Christ.

11:21.191 --> 11:23.641
"The urge to save humanity

11:23.693 --> 11:28.229
"is almost always a false front
for the urge to rule.

11:28.281 --> 11:31.232
"Power is what all messiahs
really seek,

11:31.284 --> 11:33.317
not the chance to serve."

11:33.369 --> 11:36.120
So please, everyone,
raise your glass

11:36.155 --> 11:38.656
in a toast-- to Maya.

11:38.708 --> 11:42.660
Who may very well be
the exception to the rule.

11:42.712 --> 11:43.911
To Maya.

11:43.963 --> 11:45.246
OTHERS:
To Maya.

11:45.248 --> 11:46.581
To Maya.

11:53.556 --> 11:56.507
Yeah, well, she seems happy.

11:56.559 --> 11:58.726
And thirsty.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.145
He is such a piece of shit.
Yeah.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.480
Uber for Doctors. Okay.

12:02.515 --> 12:03.731
Here's my concern:

12:03.766 --> 12:05.233
A large percentage
of your market is seniors

12:05.268 --> 12:06.817
who don't know how
to use their cell phones.

12:06.853 --> 12:09.020
Yeah, well, Kelsey's
developed an algorithm

12:09.072 --> 12:10.271
to make navigation
unbelievably simple.

12:10.323 --> 12:11.405
Kelsey, hit him with it.

12:11.441 --> 12:13.241
What it does is it calculates...

12:13.276 --> 12:14.659
I just need to know
if the geriatrics

12:14.694 --> 12:16.110
are a potential revenue source.

12:16.162 --> 12:17.361
Absolutely. 100%.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:17.413 --> 12:18.946
Only takes a second
to walk you through it.

12:18.998 --> 12:21.115
It's a pretty cool
algorithm, actually...

12:21.167 --> 12:22.416
Yeah, I'm sure it's
a "pretty cool algorithm,"

12:22.452 --> 12:23.784
but I'm good, sweetie.

12:23.836 --> 12:25.369
CLYDE: Yeah, yeah,
you know what?

12:25.421 --> 12:27.004
We're of course going after
the older demographic...

12:27.040 --> 12:29.206
No, you're right.
It's a much better idea

12:29.259 --> 12:31.626
to pour your money into something
that you don't understand.

12:31.628 --> 12:33.344
It's super smart... sweetie.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.629
CLYDE: Hey, you know what?
I have some projections

12:34.631 --> 12:36.097
of start-up costs...
Actually, that's okay.

12:36.132 --> 12:37.548
We're gonna pass.
I think will help out...come on...

12:37.600 --> 12:38.633
You're gonna pass.

12:38.685 --> 12:40.468
What do you mean?
You don't want my money?

12:40.520 --> 12:41.802
You're an asshole,
so you don't get to invest.

12:41.854 --> 12:43.137
CLYDE:
That's a funny joke.

12:43.189 --> 12:44.472
And you're being hilarious right now.
No.

12:44.524 --> 12:45.773
Yeah!
No, I'm not.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.688
So thank you for your time.
You can go away now.

12:47.694 --> 12:49.644
(scoffs)

12:49.696 --> 12:51.062
Nice dress.

12:51.114 --> 12:52.229
Fuck off!

12:52.282 --> 12:54.365
Come on!

12:54.400 --> 12:55.566
We have a solid
business plan, right?

12:55.618 --> 12:58.235
Yeah. And I'd like to get
some money to fund it.

12:58.288 --> 13:01.205
Well, I know my algorithm
fucking rocks.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.374
So we don't need to pander
to some rich asshole

13:03.409 --> 13:05.126
who doesn't give a shit.

13:05.161 --> 13:06.841
Let's pander to some
rich asshole who does.

13:11.084 --> 13:12.800
So you're fucking crazy.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.552
I mean, that's a given, right?

13:18.841 --> 13:20.424
Oh, you're not even
gonna talk back.

13:22.095 --> 13:24.145
Mr. Manchester,
over here, please.

13:24.180 --> 13:25.680
MARTY:
Big oil's full of shit.

13:25.682 --> 13:26.681
Whee!

13:26.683 --> 13:28.516
(laughing)

13:28.568 --> 13:31.102
Okay, okay, that's enough.

13:31.154 --> 13:33.187
Hey, and see if
some of those can't

13:33.189 --> 13:35.272
find their way to the Internet.

13:35.325 --> 13:38.025
Let 'em know Cal Manchester
loves starvin' kids.

13:38.077 --> 13:38.859
Whoops!

13:38.861 --> 13:41.662
Y-You know what I mean.

13:41.698 --> 13:44.115
I could use some good press.

13:44.167 --> 13:45.366
MARTY (laughing):
Yeah.

13:45.418 --> 13:47.952
Swear to Christ, every
goddamn story about me

13:48.004 --> 13:50.588
is all "ecological
nightmare" this

13:50.623 --> 13:51.956
and "raper of the Earth" that.

13:52.008 --> 13:53.758
Well, I am glad
to help you out with that.

13:53.793 --> 13:54.759
Again.

13:54.794 --> 13:56.344
Again?

13:56.379 --> 13:58.179
What's that? Again.

13:58.214 --> 13:59.213
Marty is the one who brought

13:59.265 --> 14:00.225
Ellis and Maya together.

14:00.266 --> 14:01.382
You're welcome.

14:01.384 --> 14:04.552
Not so sure I want to
thank you for that

14:04.604 --> 14:06.220
so much as rip your head off

14:06.222 --> 14:08.022
and piss on your
bloody neck stump.

14:10.276 --> 14:11.809
Hey, good to meet you, Billy.

14:11.861 --> 14:13.477
BILLY: Dad!
(sighing heavily)

14:13.529 --> 14:16.947
Okay, so enlighten me, Marty.

14:16.983 --> 14:20.067
How does a merger that
gives Maya the ability

14:20.069 --> 14:22.453
to produce her electric car
for the masses help me?

14:22.488 --> 14:23.621
Well, it doesn't.

14:23.656 --> 14:25.039
Unless, of course,

14:25.074 --> 14:26.457
producing an electric car
for the masses

14:26.492 --> 14:28.325
isn't a part of Ellis's
vision for the future.

14:28.378 --> 14:30.327
You saying it's not?

14:30.380 --> 14:31.412
Ford or Ferrari--

14:31.464 --> 14:32.747
who do you think
Ellis wants to be?

14:32.749 --> 14:34.248
DENNA:
With this merger,

14:34.250 --> 14:36.417
Maya's dream of mass production

14:36.419 --> 14:37.500
is effectively neutralized.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.170
MARTY:
Without it, however,

14:39.222 --> 14:42.256
Maya is free to take her highly
sought-after technology anywhere.

14:42.258 --> 14:44.341
And it will get made.
Yes, it will.

14:44.394 --> 14:46.510
But the merger is happening.
Absolutely.

14:46.562 --> 14:49.597
MARTY: The only question
is what part will you play

14:49.649 --> 14:51.148
in making it happen.

14:51.184 --> 14:52.817
Because what you don't know is

14:52.852 --> 14:54.935
Maya is only a partial
owner of her company.

14:54.987 --> 14:56.437
There you are.

14:56.439 --> 14:57.521
So sorry to interrupt.

14:57.573 --> 14:58.939
Can I talk to you
for one second?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.191
Uh, you <i> are</i> interrupting.

15:00.243 --> 15:01.192
It's kind of important.

15:01.244 --> 15:02.410
All right, then.

15:02.445 --> 15:03.611
Uh, excuse me?

15:07.450 --> 15:08.866
So, Cal...

15:08.918 --> 15:11.585
anyway...
how have you been?

15:11.621 --> 15:14.004
Uh, I could really use your help
with Ellis and Maya right now.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.873
Jeannie, I was in the middle
of something back there...

15:15.925 --> 15:18.125
Oh, yeah, I saw.
With, uh, Cal Manchester.

15:18.177 --> 15:19.460
The president of Compass Oil.

15:19.512 --> 15:20.628
Yeah.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.797
So I guess we have a new plan?

15:22.849 --> 15:25.966
Bully Maya into the merger
by having Cal threaten a buyout?

15:25.968 --> 15:28.969
We are providing Maya
with a valuable life lesson.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.471
You give partial
ownership of your company

15:30.473 --> 15:33.190
to your fucking grad students,
you're gonna get fucked.

15:33.226 --> 15:34.975
Wait, wait, wait--
I thought the goal here

15:34.977 --> 15:36.527
was an amicable partnership.

15:36.562 --> 15:38.279
If Maya and Ellis get along,

15:38.314 --> 15:40.197
it makes our lives
that much easier going forward.

15:40.233 --> 15:41.315
Jeannie, we tried
getting these...

15:41.367 --> 15:43.150
Bullshit we tried.

15:43.152 --> 15:44.985
They haven't even talked.
O-Okay.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.237
So, after everything
that's gone on

15:46.289 --> 15:47.955
between the two of them,
you think getting them talking,

15:47.990 --> 15:49.373
that's what's gonna help things?

15:49.408 --> 15:51.826
No, probably better to take
the same slash and burn,

15:51.878 --> 15:52.993
scorched earth approach you take

15:52.995 --> 15:54.211
with everything else
in your life.

15:54.247 --> 15:55.830
(wry laugh)

15:55.882 --> 15:58.165
Cal is a contingency plan.

15:58.167 --> 15:59.550
And it's a good one
to have in place.

15:59.585 --> 16:01.719
If you were looking at
this thing objectively,

16:01.754 --> 16:02.720
you would see that.

16:02.755 --> 16:04.255
(sighs heavily)

16:04.307 --> 16:06.390
Okay... I'm gonna keep trying

16:06.425 --> 16:07.725
to make our lives easier,

16:07.760 --> 16:08.976
if you wouldn't mind waiting

16:09.011 --> 16:11.428
to pull the pin on the
Cal Manchester grenade.

16:11.481 --> 16:12.446
Okay.

16:12.482 --> 16:14.565
Good luck, Jeannie Bean.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.567
I'll take a break on
the slashin' and burnin'.

16:21.657 --> 16:23.023
Whew! (chuckles)

16:23.025 --> 16:24.275
Some exorbitant bids.

16:24.327 --> 16:26.243
That-that's for a good cause.

16:26.279 --> 16:28.529
But, uh, look, Danny, I really
would love to buy you something--

16:28.531 --> 16:30.030
trust me-- but, uh...

16:30.032 --> 16:31.532
well, the truth is...
(clears throat)

16:31.534 --> 16:33.200
I'm a little cash poor
at the moment.

16:33.252 --> 16:35.536
Now, all that's gonna change,
once we get this app launched,

16:35.538 --> 16:38.506
so, uh, have you given any more
thought to investing?

16:38.541 --> 16:39.590
No pressure.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.008
I'm still thinking.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.843
Mm-hmm.
It's a great opportunity, no doubt.

16:42.879 --> 16:44.094
Yeah. No doubt.

16:44.130 --> 16:45.212
No doubt.

16:46.966 --> 16:48.349
Hey, how 'bout this--

16:48.384 --> 16:50.684
how 'bout, instead of me
buying you something here,

16:50.720 --> 16:52.520
I just write you a sweet
college recommendation?

16:52.555 --> 16:55.773
What? Uh-huh. I put in
a good word at my alma mater.

16:57.610 --> 16:58.609
It's a good school.

16:58.644 --> 17:00.978
It's a great school, actually.

17:01.030 --> 17:04.315
No, it's the Harvard
of the East, if you will.

17:06.652 --> 17:07.952
It's Harvard.
I went to Harvard.

17:07.987 --> 17:09.453
College is bullshit.

17:09.488 --> 17:11.070
Ooh, not sure about that.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.153
Yeah, okay, sure, it's bullshit.
It's total bullshit.

17:15.328 --> 17:16.410
I want the basket.

17:17.797 --> 17:19.213
But that's... alcohol.

17:19.248 --> 17:20.548
(laughing):
I mean, I can't...

17:20.583 --> 17:21.782
Danny, I can't buy you alcohol.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.000
That's okay.
I get it.

17:23.051 --> 17:25.502
You're broke,
and you've got all these

17:25.555 --> 17:26.755
judgmental assholes everywhere.

17:26.756 --> 17:28.172
Exactly. Yeah.

17:28.223 --> 17:30.424
It's really more about
the judgmental assholes.

17:30.426 --> 17:32.426
So here's what you do:

17:32.428 --> 17:33.928
You go down to the liquor store,

17:33.930 --> 17:36.564
buy me a couple bottles of vodka
and a pack of cigarettes.

17:36.599 --> 17:37.565
It'll be our little secret.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.484
Uh... no.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.069
I mean, I can't, Danny.
I'm sorry.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.321
Okay.

17:44.357 --> 17:46.106
I guess you don't want me
to fully fund your venture.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.658
I... no, I...
That's fine.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.693
(sighing)

17:51.747 --> 17:54.031
(indistinct conversation)

17:54.083 --> 17:55.616
Wait, Danny, Danny...

17:55.618 --> 17:56.917
(chuckling):
Hey...

17:58.537 --> 18:00.371
So what's your brand?

18:00.423 --> 18:01.622
Anyway, I was in preschool

18:01.624 --> 18:03.624
when I realized I was
destined for greatness.

18:03.676 --> 18:04.959
I also realized in preschool

18:04.961 --> 18:06.844
that my teacher was
trying to undermine me.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.796
She didn't believe in me...
because she was a cunt.

18:08.798 --> 18:10.681
(baby crying)
JEANNIE: Uh, Maya,

18:10.716 --> 18:13.634
did Ellis tell you about
the, uh, daycare center

18:13.636 --> 18:15.886
he has planned for the
employees at Gage?

18:15.938 --> 18:16.938
A daycare center? Really?

18:16.939 --> 18:19.223
Well, he felt
it was long overdue.

18:19.275 --> 18:20.608
Didn't you, Ellis?

18:20.643 --> 18:22.643
Uh, yep. Sure.

18:22.645 --> 18:24.311
Uh, why don't you
let me hold him?

18:24.363 --> 18:25.813
People say I have a
calming presence.

18:25.815 --> 18:27.031
Her. It's a girl.

18:27.066 --> 18:28.616
Are you sure?

18:28.651 --> 18:30.534
You're asking if I know the sex
of my own child?

18:30.569 --> 18:31.952
Well, adopted child.

18:31.988 --> 18:34.321
You have so many, I thought
maybe you got confused.

18:34.373 --> 18:36.490
Okay, just take her.

18:37.493 --> 18:39.293
MAYA:
You're okay.

18:39.328 --> 18:42.296
WOMAN: So, when does the
merger become official?

18:42.331 --> 18:44.415
The documents will be
signed and ready on Monday.

18:44.467 --> 18:46.133
And it can't come
soon enough, because,

18:46.168 --> 18:49.053
while Maya built a great
little company for herself,

18:49.088 --> 18:50.804
it's time for her to come
back to the big leagues

18:50.840 --> 18:52.172
where she belongs.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.891
Because--
make no mistake about it--

18:53.926 --> 18:55.175
I plan to lead us

18:55.177 --> 18:57.227
into the future, and the future

18:57.263 --> 19:00.064
is coming faster
than anyone anticipated.

19:00.099 --> 19:01.098
Wow!

19:01.150 --> 19:02.900
What is your problem?

19:02.935 --> 19:05.069
My problem?
My problem is that

19:05.104 --> 19:07.938
you are the same pompous,
dismissive, arrogant

19:07.990 --> 19:10.024
prick that you've always been.

19:10.026 --> 19:13.027
You just say these things
that are supposed

19:13.029 --> 19:14.411
to be profound.

19:14.447 --> 19:16.163
They mean absolutely nothing.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.698
"The future is coming faster

19:17.750 --> 19:19.833
than any of us
could have anticipated"?

19:19.869 --> 19:22.119
Fuck you!

19:23.205 --> 19:25.422
I'm gonna go talk to her.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.458
Good luck.

19:28.544 --> 19:29.760
(sighs)

19:29.795 --> 19:32.680
Women, right, guys?

19:33.716 --> 19:35.349
JEANNIE:
Maya?

19:35.384 --> 19:38.135
Maya...

19:38.187 --> 19:40.137
I understand how you feel.

19:40.189 --> 19:41.689
Okay, believe me.

19:41.724 --> 19:44.558
But he's here, you
know, and he's trying.

19:44.610 --> 19:47.061
I am sure it looks
that way to you.

19:47.113 --> 19:49.113
He just donated
a million dollars

19:49.148 --> 19:50.564
to your charity.

19:50.566 --> 19:53.283
We will never see
that money, Jeannie.

19:53.319 --> 19:55.569
Just like there's never
gonna be a daycare center.

19:55.571 --> 19:58.572
Ellis is the king of
making grandiose promises

19:58.574 --> 19:59.907
and then never
following through.

19:59.959 --> 20:01.709
Then why did you even
want him here?

20:01.744 --> 20:03.127
I don't know. I guess maybe

20:03.162 --> 20:04.795
I wanted to witness
the new humility

20:04.830 --> 20:06.163
you said he had found.

20:06.215 --> 20:07.414
I thought maybe he had changed.

20:07.416 --> 20:08.549
He has changed.

20:08.584 --> 20:09.967
And he will
write you that check.

20:10.002 --> 20:11.218
It's not just about the check.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.886
It's everything.

20:12.922 --> 20:16.590
Soon as he opened up his mouth,
it all came flooding back.

20:16.592 --> 20:20.427
Just how miserable I was
during the whole Ellis era.

20:20.429 --> 20:22.179
Okay, well,
we have a deal in place that...

20:22.231 --> 20:24.398
I realize this puts you
in a difficult situation,

20:24.433 --> 20:26.567
and I am so sorry for that,

20:26.602 --> 20:28.152
but I'm not signing those papers.
Maya?

20:28.187 --> 20:29.570
Maya?
What?

20:29.605 --> 20:32.906
Please, please just hear me out.

20:32.942 --> 20:35.025
CLYDE: It's so weird,
'cause I've never

20:35.077 --> 20:38.028
been attracted to a girl like
this before, but Kelsey's great.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.279
You know?

20:39.281 --> 20:41.331
Smart, funny,
knows exactly what she wants.

20:41.367 --> 20:44.168
My main concern is
the physical attraction

20:44.203 --> 20:46.503
in the long term.
Yeah.

20:46.539 --> 20:48.338
You know, sometimes, I think
I hear this slight clinking,

20:48.374 --> 20:49.706
like, "clink, clink, clink"

20:49.759 --> 20:51.708
clinking noise
every time she walks.

20:51.761 --> 20:54.344
I'm afraid there might be
multiple clitoral piercings.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.629
Uh-huh.

20:55.631 --> 20:57.598
Yeah. I'm almost certain of it.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.633
But, like, what's the best
situation out of all this?

20:59.635 --> 21:01.135
We get together.
Then what? We break up.

21:01.137 --> 21:03.103
Now it's weird because
we're in business together.

21:03.139 --> 21:05.305
So, I don't go out with her,
I do not ask her out.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.474
It's that easy.

21:07.476 --> 21:09.560
Ah, but I do think
she's cute, man.

21:09.612 --> 21:11.445
I mean, I don't know.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.780
What do you think?

21:14.316 --> 21:16.557
You think I should probably stop
being such a pussy, huh?

21:16.569 --> 21:18.452
Is that what you're giving me?

21:18.487 --> 21:20.070
Fuck it.

21:20.122 --> 21:21.622
You're right.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.040
I'm going for it.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.325
I'm gonna get it.

21:28.631 --> 21:30.080
Ah.

21:30.132 --> 21:31.915
So, give it to me.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.300
(clears throat)

21:33.335 --> 21:35.169
So, we will do it your way.

21:35.171 --> 21:40.140
Jeannie, you're about to make
a horrible old man very happy.

21:40.176 --> 21:42.593
Oh, Cal.

21:42.645 --> 21:44.845
(both laugh)

21:44.897 --> 21:46.847
You were right, Marty.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.098
Congratulations.

21:48.150 --> 21:49.900
Thank you.

21:49.935 --> 21:53.020
You want me to see
if they're serving crow?

21:53.022 --> 21:55.739
(laughs)

21:55.774 --> 21:57.524
Thank you.

21:58.527 --> 22:00.027
Who was that?

22:00.029 --> 22:01.778
The whitest man in
the world, or...?

22:01.831 --> 22:03.363
Uh, yeah.
Mmm.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.083
Also, a guy who wants
to put up our seed money.

22:06.118 --> 22:07.618
Are you fucking
ser...? All of it?

22:07.670 --> 22:09.002
That's amazing.

22:09.038 --> 22:11.371
Yeah, I, uh, managed
to find a rich investor

22:11.373 --> 22:13.624
in the Bay Area who's
interested in technology.

22:13.676 --> 22:16.093
Mind blown. Uh, anyway,
he wants to talk details

22:16.128 --> 22:17.761
after this thing wraps up.
Yeah. Great.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.963
And then after that, we should
go someplace nice to celebrate.

22:20.015 --> 22:21.431
Just you and I should.

22:21.467 --> 22:24.051
And we're not inviting
Doug 'cause he's broke?

22:25.437 --> 22:28.722
Listen, I know, um, we've been
doing this little dance,

22:28.724 --> 22:30.941
but the truth is,

22:30.976 --> 22:33.393
I like you.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.229
Like, I feel like there's
something special here

22:35.231 --> 22:36.897
and we should really
see where it goes...

22:36.899 --> 22:37.898
No.

22:43.372 --> 22:45.289
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:45.324 --> 22:46.623
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:58.337 --> 22:59.636
Yeah, no.

22:59.672 --> 23:02.923
Okay. I heard you
the first time.

23:05.978 --> 23:07.678
I say go for it.

23:07.730 --> 23:09.897
(groaning)

23:09.932 --> 23:12.983
And you saw the part
where she said...

23:13.018 --> 23:15.736
Just the noes.
You saw the noes.

23:18.274 --> 23:20.107
DENNA: I'll be back
from London next week.

23:20.109 --> 23:21.275
See you then?

23:21.327 --> 23:22.609
Can't wait.

23:22.661 --> 23:24.611
I should say
good-bye to Cal.

23:24.613 --> 23:26.830
Oh.

23:26.865 --> 23:27.915
DENNA:
Aha.

23:27.950 --> 23:29.116
MARTY:
Yeah, he's a little busy.

23:29.118 --> 23:31.418
I'll tell him you
said good-bye.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.453
It was a pleasure
watching you work today, Marty.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.922
Thank you.

23:36.709 --> 23:38.458
Jeannie, nice meeting you.

23:46.268 --> 23:47.935
But I didn't get you anything.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.304
I was about to give that
to a 15-year-old boy

23:50.306 --> 23:52.973
to secure our seed money.
Now I'm not. Do you know why?

23:52.975 --> 23:54.891
Because you don't trust
yourself around him?

23:54.944 --> 23:57.027
No, because that's not really
Danny Buckingham.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.695
Oh, my God.

23:58.731 --> 24:00.814
Thank God I looked him up
on the cab ride back here,

24:00.816 --> 24:03.066
or else...
KELSEY: Sorry, Doug.

24:03.118 --> 24:04.401
I meant to tell you
before. It just...

24:04.453 --> 24:06.486
No. Hey, it's my fault for being
the gullible one, right?

24:06.488 --> 24:08.121
You trust people.
I like that about you.

24:08.157 --> 24:10.741
In fact, it's one of the things
I like most about you.

24:10.793 --> 24:12.709
Not that there's much
to choose from.

24:12.745 --> 24:14.745
Clyde switched back
to full asshole mode

24:14.797 --> 24:16.830
now that I won't
go out with him.

24:16.832 --> 24:18.382
DOUG: Really?
CLYDE: No.

24:18.417 --> 24:21.835
Oh, how the tables have turned.

24:21.837 --> 24:23.170
So she rejected you.

24:23.172 --> 24:25.222
No, she didn't reject me.

24:25.257 --> 24:26.506
I asked her out as a goof.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.091
She knew I was kidding,
so she said no.

24:28.143 --> 24:30.477
That's the only reason.
She didn't reject me.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.847
I absolutely believe you, Clyde.

24:33.849 --> 24:36.733
MAYA:
Excuse me, everyone.

24:36.769 --> 24:39.186
So, it is time to announce

24:39.188 --> 24:43.323
the winners
of the silent auction.

24:47.029 --> 24:50.113
Everything?
Are you fucking kid...

24:50.165 --> 24:51.164
(sighs)

24:51.200 --> 24:52.499
That's fine. That's fine.

24:53.869 --> 24:57.954
So, it seems
that Ellis Hightower

24:58.007 --> 25:01.708
is the highest bidder
on every item.

25:01.710 --> 25:02.709
(chatter, applause)

25:02.711 --> 25:04.511
Of course he is.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.712
MAYA:
Now...

25:05.764 --> 25:09.049
payment is expected
by the end of the evening,

25:09.051 --> 25:12.886
so if you were the second
highest bidder on anything,

25:12.938 --> 25:17.190
I'd say you probably
still have a chance, so...

25:17.226 --> 25:18.608
Here we go.

25:21.897 --> 25:25.065
So, what's this,
a $10,000 table?

25:25.117 --> 25:26.233
Cheap fucks.

25:26.235 --> 25:28.735
Here, let me
reimburse you for that.

25:28.737 --> 25:31.655
You know, I gave my
students a piece

25:31.707 --> 25:33.457
of the company to motivate them.

25:33.492 --> 25:35.575
You used that generosity
to fuck me over.

25:35.627 --> 25:37.377
MARTY:
Hey. Come on.

25:37.413 --> 25:38.628
Such pessimism.

25:38.664 --> 25:40.831
Listen, maybe your students
will be immune

25:40.883 --> 25:42.123
to the lure of Cal Manchester's

25:42.134 --> 25:43.417
bottomless fucking pockets.

25:43.469 --> 25:45.419
I mean, if history's
taught us anything,

25:45.421 --> 25:47.554
it's that socialism
really works, right?

25:47.589 --> 25:50.223
Merge with Ellis or be overtaken
by a giant oil conglomerate.

25:50.259 --> 25:52.392
I have to hand it to all of you.

25:52.428 --> 25:53.677
You managed to make
Ellis Hightower

25:53.729 --> 25:56.730
the lesser of two evils.

25:56.765 --> 25:59.266
Great fucking job.

26:00.402 --> 26:02.436
Oh. And, Jeannie,

26:02.438 --> 26:06.106
I wouldn't worry too much
about motherhood changing you.

26:06.158 --> 26:08.408
People like you don't change.

26:11.747 --> 26:13.747
(chuckles softly)

26:13.782 --> 26:15.449
Hey, fuck her.

26:15.451 --> 26:17.951
Yeah, fuck her.

26:18.003 --> 26:19.953
ELLIS:
Thank you. Thank you.

26:22.341 --> 26:25.425
One Child, One Spirit.

26:25.461 --> 26:27.761
One high bidder.

26:27.796 --> 26:29.629
Thank you, everybody.

26:31.467 --> 26:34.180
Sorry about the whole
clipboard fiasco.

26:34.970 --> 26:36.970
Next year, we're going to do
electronic bidding,

26:36.972 --> 26:38.772
I can promise you that.

26:38.807 --> 26:42.225
But wow, what a day
for hungry children.

26:42.277 --> 26:44.311
Huh? Yeah.
(applause)

26:44.313 --> 26:46.396
Let's hear it. That's right.

26:46.448 --> 26:47.614
You're welcome.
