00:31.899 --> 00:34.095
Honey, I'm home.

01:05.432 --> 01:09.266
All right, here comes
the grandma train.

01:09.336 --> 01:13.295
Open the tunnel. Choo-choo.

01:13.373 --> 01:14.841
Mm-mm.

01:14.908 --> 01:19.004
It's delicious. Num-num.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.478
You eat it.

01:20.547 --> 01:24.950
You wanna open your mouth, or you
want me to feed you to a pterodactyl?

01:25.919 --> 01:28.149
Ahh.

01:30.290 --> 01:31.917
Jlalalalalalas

01:31.992 --> 01:35.121
Aw, look at the good boy
eating his supper.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.526
Was he any trouble, Mom?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.965
No, he was a perfect angel.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.831
More, please.

01:45.906 --> 01:49.399
I met the nicest male
in the invertebrate aisle.

01:49.476 --> 01:52.036
He helped me chisel off
some frozen squid.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.047
Aw, hello, you little sweet thing.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.311
Grandma giving you a good dinner?

01:57.384 --> 02:01.343
Whoa, the mama, out of nowhere
asking all kinds of questions.

02:01.421 --> 02:05.221
And gone. Mama here, mama gone.
Gotta have the mama.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.124
OK.

02:07.194 --> 02:10.425
- There.
- [cooing]

02:10.497 --> 02:13.467
I ran into the same male
in the parking lot.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.434
He helped carry my cart.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.630
I don't know why.
I mean, it had wheels.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.638
But still, it was very considerate.

02:19.706 --> 02:22.539
Why shouldn't he be interested?
You've got your figure.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.169
Oh, stop. I'm a mother of three.

02:25.245 --> 02:28.237
Hello, family... and Ethyl.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.046
Look, it's your father.
Say hello to the loser.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.142
Loser!

02:32.219 --> 02:33.709
Am not!

02:33.787 --> 02:36.017
How was your day, Earl?

02:36.089 --> 02:37.818
Uneventful, which is always good.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.689
Anything new here on the homefront?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.024
Fran made a new friend
in the squid aisle.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.359
- [Earl] Uh-huh.
- He helped me with my cart.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.694
[Earl] That's nice.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.962
"To the male of the house."

02:48.035 --> 02:50.299
I believe that's me.
[chuckling]

02:50.370 --> 02:51.769
Loser.

02:51.839 --> 02:55.935
It's refreshing to meet a genuinely
nice dinosaur once in a while.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.273
[creatures screeching]

03:02.850 --> 03:04.375
Oh, boy.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.215
What is it, Earl?

03:06.286 --> 03:08.152
Oh, uh, it's nothing.
[chuckling]

03:08.222 --> 03:09.917
It's funny, but nothing.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.459
I'm chuckling at its complete
lack of anything.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.119
[chuckling]

03:14.194 --> 03:17.255
Earl, do you want mint jelly
with your squid cakes?

03:17.331 --> 03:18.662
[Earl] Whatever, my sweet.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.359
By the way, uh,

03:20.434 --> 03:23.768
this, this, this fellow
you met at the market?

03:23.837 --> 03:28.673
He was a short, delicate,
little wisp of a thing, perhaps?

03:28.742 --> 03:31.143
No, he was quite tall.

03:31.211 --> 03:35.773
But, uh, hunched over and feeble?

03:35.849 --> 03:38.511
No, he must have been
at least 50 feet high.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.486
It was hard to tell. There were
clouds in front of his face.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.817
Gary, his name was Gary.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.262
Terror has a new name: Gary.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.731
It's nice stationery.

03:52.799 --> 03:57.794
"From the Law Offices of Spikeback,
Ribcrusher and Fenski."

03:59.039 --> 04:03.306
Dear Mr. Sinclair, I'm writing to you
on behalf of my client Gary,

04:03.377 --> 04:05.505
who met your wife at the supermarket,

04:05.579 --> 04:08.605
and who would like
to take her as his mate.

04:08.682 --> 04:12.710
Under section 412, article 9,
of the Code of the Wilderness,

04:12.786 --> 04:16.017
he is entitled to do so
after a brief struggle

04:16.089 --> 04:18.113
which you have no chance of surviving

04:18.192 --> 04:23.187
insofar as my client is nine times
your size and undefeated.”

04:23.263 --> 04:26.028
Gary will arrive at your house
Friday at 6:00

04:26.099 --> 04:29.228
to take possession
of your family and home."

04:29.303 --> 04:32.068
Friday. Friday?

04:35.242 --> 04:39.543
"P.S. Should you need assistance
in preparing your will,

04:39.613 --> 04:42.173
we hope you will think of us first."

04:42.249 --> 04:44.843
Gee, that's nice of 'em.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.943
I know they just crawled
out of the sludge,

04:47.020 --> 04:49.045
and I hate to criticize
other life forms,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.523
but God, I hate lawyers.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.822
What does Fran think about all of this?

04:53.894 --> 04:56.488
After all,
she is the female in question.

04:56.563 --> 04:59.658
I haven't told her.
I wanted to work out my plan first.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.895
No kidding, you got a plan?

05:01.969 --> 05:04.438
Yeah, it's pretty simple, really.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.907
Gary arrives at 6:00,
and I'm dead by 6:03.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.945
Maybe 6:05, if I can hold
the bathroom door closed.

05:11.011 --> 05:15.847
Well, pally-boy, just be glad you're
living during the apex of civilization.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.613
You know, in the olden days,
a guy like Gary

05:18.685 --> 05:22.349
would have just snuck up behind you
and bit off your pelvis.

05:22.422 --> 05:25.517
Now, you get a nice embossed letter.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.754
Hey, what is this, cotton bond?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.092
Will you forget about the stationery?

05:30.164 --> 05:32.599
I'm about to get dismembered
in my own living room.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.929
All right, all right.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.164
Strictly speaking,
I'm not qualified to serve as counsel.

05:37.237 --> 05:41.196
However, in cases like this,
there is an escape clause.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.004
There is? What is it?

05:43.076 --> 05:46.637
Well, basically, you're entitled
to escape from his claws.

05:46.713 --> 05:49.045
The Code of the Wilderness
clearly states

05:49.116 --> 05:53.144
that you have the legal right
to run away like a scared bunny.

05:53.220 --> 05:58.249
So if I stay, I die
in big, embarrassing pieces

05:58.325 --> 06:02.762
but if I flee, I'm cast out as a coward
for the rest of my days.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.798
Hmm.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.300
They both have their advantages.

06:09.136 --> 06:14.131
And the little train learned
that if you try and try and try,

06:14.208 --> 06:16.939
you can do anything.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.307
Not true.

06:18.378 --> 06:22.372
Without fiber in your diet, you can try
till you're blue in the face.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.451
Again! Again! Again!

06:25.519 --> 06:27.544
- All right.
- [doorbell]

06:27.621 --> 06:31.615
This time, we'll read one of my books.
It's called Lust In The Swamp.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.922
Mother, children's stories.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.484
Of course, dear.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.394
[Robbie] Hey, mom, check this out!

06:37.464 --> 06:39.626
"Once upon a time...

06:39.700 --> 06:42.863
Kirk stood poised on the diving board,

06:42.936 --> 06:45.098
his tail glistening in the sun...

06:45.172 --> 06:47.106
Ahh.

06:47.174 --> 06:50.041
A delivery guy just brought this.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.273
[groaning]

06:53.347 --> 06:56.681
Oh, it's from that nice fellow Gary
I met at the market.

06:56.750 --> 07:01.119
He says he's coming Friday
to crush Earl,

07:01.188 --> 07:05.147
take the house and kids
and make me his loving bride.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.557
That's so romantic.

07:07.628 --> 07:11.428
He sent some of his laundry
so I can get a head start. Oh!

07:11.498 --> 07:13.227
I don't get it. What's going on?

07:13.300 --> 07:16.634
Your father's been challenged
to a fight to the death.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.137
What?

07:18.205 --> 07:20.105
How does Earl stack up to this guy?

07:22.543 --> 07:25.535
Well, this is his sock.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.580
Congratulations, you're a widow.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.048
But I like Dad.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.482
You're just used to him.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.487
It's not fair I just get handed over
to some new guy.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.217
Sweetheart, trust me, you're trading up.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.590
I'm alone in here.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.460
[laughing]

07:44.731 --> 07:46.995
Robbie, would you go
look after your brother?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.229
All right, but I'd like
to go on record here.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.533
I'm pretty sure killing Dad is wrong.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.503
How can you talk like this?
I love Earl.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.674
I can't imagine living without Earl.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.716
That's sweet.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.151
All right, we've mourned long enough.

08:07.221 --> 08:09.622
What do you say we start
cleaning out his closets.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.660
Oh, I can't believe Earl
didn't mention this.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.354
He's been carrying this burden
all by himself.

08:15.429 --> 08:16.897
Yeah, yeah, he's a saint.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.432
He didn't even blame me.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.332
A lesser male would have,
but not my Earl.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.698
[door closes]

08:22.769 --> 08:26.228
You! You flirt with some masta-Don Juan,

08:26.306 --> 08:29.537
in the invertebrate aisle
and now I'm gonna die!

08:29.610 --> 08:31.339
Earl, it wasn't like that.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.936
Oh, yes it was.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.741
Ah, there you were,

08:34.815 --> 08:37.909
pushing your cart
seductively down the aisle,

08:37.985 --> 08:40.852
swinging that tail for
the whole world to see.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.118
"Excuse me,
Mr. 90-foot husband killer,

08:44.191 --> 08:46.285
I can't reach the top shelf.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.590
But if you get that can for me,

08:48.662 --> 08:50.528
you can have my whole family!"

08:50.597 --> 08:52.656
Earl, you're being ridiculous.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.361
- [telephone rings]
- [grumbling]

08:55.435 --> 08:56.869
Hello?

08:56.937 --> 08:59.838
No, Gary's not here yet!

08:59.907 --> 09:02.968
Friday, he'll be here Friday,
and then forever.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.308
[groans] OK, all right,
I'll take a message.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.814
Stan, yeah, uh-huh.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.907
Brunch Sunday.
Right, got it.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.476
All right, I'll tell him.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.613
Earl, you didn't have to do that.

09:15.689 --> 09:19.353
I know how mad I get when
I don't get my messages.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.656
Hey, what the heck is this?

09:21.728 --> 09:24.595
It's Gary's sock. He thinks
I'm gonna do his laundry.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.759
His laundry?
He thinks you're gonna do...

09:26.834 --> 09:28.029
His sock?

09:28.101 --> 09:29.694
His foot?

09:29.770 --> 09:32.137
How many of these feet does he have?

09:32.206 --> 09:35.471
Earl, listen to me.
There's only one thing you can do.

09:35.542 --> 09:39.342
You have to go away forever
and never come back.

09:39.413 --> 09:43.850
You have to do that because
I love you and I want you safe.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.615
Oh, Fran, it seems so wrong
to give up my whole family

09:47.688 --> 09:49.918
on account of one sock.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.691
You're saying you want me to leave town?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.699
If I can't have you here with me

10:00.767 --> 10:02.861
I want to at least know you're safe.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.201
Fran, part of me is saying,
"Hey, this is my house.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.832
"I ought to stay and fight."

10:07.908 --> 10:10.104
That's probably the part
to get eaten first.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.407
Earl, I can't tell you what to do.

10:12.479 --> 10:15.574
You have to choose
what you think is right.

10:15.649 --> 10:19.176
You choose. Pick the one where
I don't hear anything snap.

10:19.253 --> 10:22.154
Well, Earl, maybe you can win.

10:22.222 --> 10:27.319
Maybe a guy your size could beat
a rampaging 50-foot dilophosaurus.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.159
Hand me my jammies, Fran.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.433
Oh, Fran, tell me the truth.

10:36.503 --> 10:39.097
Do you like this Gary fellow?

10:39.173 --> 10:41.403
Earl, I love you.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.705
You're the one I want
to spend my life with,

10:43.777 --> 10:46.610
you big lizard.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.843
I'm gonna miss you, Fran.
I really am.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.852
But I want you to be brave
and try to make a life with Gar.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.684
Oh, Earl.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.850
Or you could slowly poison him
over the next few years.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.324
Your choice.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.820
[girl on TV] Gosh, Lyle,
I really like you.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.595
1 just wish you had... horns.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.363
[narrator] Oh, that hurt.

11:09.436 --> 11:12.064
Hi, I'm Spike Sterling,

11:12.139 --> 11:15.336
president of the Horn Club For Males.

11:15.409 --> 11:18.003
And I can give you a full head

11:18.078 --> 11:20.638
of long, luxurious horns

11:20.714 --> 11:23.615
without penetrating your skull.

11:23.684 --> 11:27.211
1 did it gradually,
and no one even noticed.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.415
- <i>Not only am I...</i>
- <i>Robbie?</i>

11:29.490 --> 11:31.549
Hey, Dad.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.117
As you know, I've been challenged.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.994
For reasons too complicated to explain,
I've chosen not to fight.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.899
But Dad, who's gonna play catch
with me? Take me fishing?

11:41.969 --> 11:43.869
I don't know. Who does that now?

11:43.937 --> 11:46.599
Nobody, but I was hoping we could start.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.539
Aw, gee, son, I would have liked that.

11:48.609 --> 11:49.940
[baby laughing]

11:53.447 --> 11:55.609
Aw, and Junior.

11:55.682 --> 11:59.277
When you're all grown up,
and I'm just a photo in a frame

11:59.353 --> 12:02.846
will you even remember
the special bond we had?

12:05.726 --> 12:07.057
Move over!

12:07.127 --> 12:10.586
[groans] Oh, oh, the TV!
[snickering]

12:10.664 --> 12:13.190
- That's daddy's little boy.
- Shh.

12:13.267 --> 12:16.965
Wow, who would have thought
I'd miss my kids this much?

12:17.037 --> 12:19.472
Oh, oh, and I have another one.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.644
Ah, there's my baby girl.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.683
Still blissfully ignorant
of her father's terrible fate.

12:29.750 --> 12:33.277
Charlene, there's something
very important I have to tell you

12:33.353 --> 12:35.845
in these, our last precious moments.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.187
Can it wait? 'Cause I have
to ask you a favor.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.090
Oh, anything, my princess.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.595
I've got some friends
coming over this afternoon.

12:42.663 --> 12:44.688
I was just wondering,
while they're here,

12:44.765 --> 12:46.358
maybe you could not be.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.926
Oh, my little girl's
embarrassed by her father.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.563
I remember when I was
embarrassed by my father.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.835
And now, the torch has been passed.

12:54.908 --> 12:58.469
My baby's grown up.
She's ashamed of me.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.536
So then, you'll leave?

13:00.614 --> 13:02.810
These are the moments
a father lives for.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.375
I built this family.
I raised you kids.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.251
I didn't actually raise you,
but I watched with interest.

13:08.322 --> 13:11.553
I have earned this, it's mine.
I am never gonna leave.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.492
OK, we'll move the meeting
to Mindy's house.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.962
Fran, Robbie, come in here.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.260
Hey, I am not going
to miss out on this,

13:19.333 --> 13:22.030
or any of your other
insulting rites of passage.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.467
What's going on, Earl?

13:23.537 --> 13:26.006
I have decided to stay and fight.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.974
Dad, are you sure?
You saw Gary's sock.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.478
Bring on his socks, bring on his shorts,
the whole hamper!

13:32.546 --> 13:35.743
Earl Sinclair
is fighting for his family.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.649
And let no one underestimate the fury

13:38.719 --> 13:42.849
of a determined megalosaurus
who is not afraid to stand alone.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.550
Here's the way I see it.

13:44.625 --> 13:47.424
If all of us stick together,
then none of us has to get hurt.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.555
But none of us are gonna get hurt.
Gary's only killing you.

13:50.631 --> 13:51.962
Yeah.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.966
My point is, we gotta get organized,

13:54.034 --> 13:56.059
because this could happen
to any one of us.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.535
But it didn't.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.766
And you're the only one married to Fran.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.605
- Yeah. Let's get lunch.
- Guys, guys.

14:02.676 --> 14:07.011
Our buddy Earl is in trouble here.
He needs our help.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.674
So who's gonna be there Friday?

14:09.750 --> 14:13.084
- I got a Yahtzee tournament.
- I'm getting my teeth drilled.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.212
Next time for sure.

14:16.757 --> 14:20.125
Boy.
[exhales]

14:20.194 --> 14:22.993
Every one of 'em's got plans.
Who'd have guessed it?

14:23.063 --> 14:24.929
How about you, Roy?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.194
Hey, you're my pal, pally-boy.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.429
I'd never desert you
in your hour of need.

14:29.503 --> 14:32.268
Lookit here, I got you a book.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.829
Oh.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.608
"So You've Been Challenged.

14:37.678 --> 14:39.942
How to Get Ready
For a Fight to the Death.”

14:40.013 --> 14:42.812
We're gonna get you in such good shape,

14:42.883 --> 14:45.011
Old Gary there's
gonna have to think twice

14:45.085 --> 14:47.554
before he kills the next guy.

14:47.621 --> 14:51.114
Eh! Eh! That's my boy.

15:09.777 --> 15:11.609
[thud]

15:24.124 --> 15:25.819
[crack]

16:03.063 --> 16:05.395
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.325
This is it.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.336
My final day of life.

16:10.404 --> 16:14.068
The last time I gaze on my alarm clock.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.473
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

16:17.578 --> 16:20.172
[yawns]

16:20.247 --> 16:23.342
Goodbye, my trusty timekeeper.

16:25.586 --> 16:27.384
[alarm stops]

16:27.454 --> 16:29.115
And you, lamp.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.625
You brought light where
once there was darkness.

16:32.693 --> 16:36.095
Oh! Off, on,

16:36.163 --> 16:39.428
off, on, off, on,

16:39.500 --> 16:41.901
off.

16:41.969 --> 16:43.300
On.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.830
We always understood each other.

16:47.708 --> 16:50.905
Oh, and you, my lint brush!

16:50.978 --> 16:53.913
So much remains unsaid!

16:53.981 --> 16:56.382
[smooching]

16:56.450 --> 16:58.179
- Earl?
- Oh, hi, Fran.

16:58.252 --> 17:00.584
I made Clydesdale pancakes.
Hurry on down.

17:00.654 --> 17:02.918
Thank you.

17:02.990 --> 17:05.152
Oh, God, 12 hours left.

17:05.224 --> 17:07.751
I've got to experience
every moment to the fullest.

17:07.828 --> 17:11.230
I've gotta squeeze the life out
of every second I've got left!

17:11.298 --> 17:13.164
What should I wear?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.271
Nah. Nah.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.641
Yeah.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.341
Yeah.

17:43.163 --> 17:47.498
Hey, Dad. Dad, Mom's wondering
what's taking so long.

17:47.568 --> 17:50.060
Oh, my goodness,
the whole day's gone.

17:50.137 --> 17:54.267
Uh, all right.
I'll just go with the plaid.

17:55.576 --> 17:57.704
Uh, goodbye other shirt.

17:57.778 --> 18:01.043
Gary, Daddy.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.105
Daddy, Gary!

18:03.183 --> 18:04.742
Aaah!

18:04.818 --> 18:08.345
No, no, no, no. Gimme.

18:08.422 --> 18:09.651
Nice.

18:09.723 --> 18:10.815
Ahh.

18:10.891 --> 18:13.292
Is your father coming?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.590
He's still saying goodbye
to his shoetree.

18:15.662 --> 18:19.895
I want you to know I'm never
going to call this new guy Dad,

18:19.967 --> 18:21.901
even if he wins me over with gifts,

18:21.969 --> 18:25.599
and cash and a phone in my room.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.664
Goodbye, banister.

18:31.345 --> 18:34.178
Goodbye, staircase.

18:34.248 --> 18:37.240
I don't want to single
any one of you out.

18:38.652 --> 18:40.814
Hello, Earl.

18:41.922 --> 18:44.482
[sighs]

18:44.558 --> 18:49.291
And finally, my beloved family.

18:49.363 --> 18:52.196
"How do I say goodbye to you?"

18:52.266 --> 18:53.700
[doorbell rings]

18:53.767 --> 18:54.825
[gasp]

18:54.902 --> 18:57.462
See ya.

18:57.538 --> 18:59.973
Wait a minute, Dad.
You don't have to go alone.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.940
We can fight him together.
Boom! Pow!

19:02.009 --> 19:05.673
If you were 40 feet taller,
I'd take you up on that.

19:05.746 --> 19:07.305
Now, you kids close your eyes,

19:07.381 --> 19:10.510
or one day you're gonna
require a lot of therapy.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.851
Oh. Oh.

19:14.922 --> 19:17.983
Oh. Oh.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.829
[shrieks]

19:30.237 --> 19:32.604
Uh, pardon me.
Is this the Sinclair house?

19:32.673 --> 19:37.110
Uh, let's see. Pressure point.
Pressure point.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.669
Hey, what are you doing?
Cut that out.

19:44.718 --> 19:46.652
Fran, I don't think I'm winning.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.917
Look, I have an appointment
with Earl Sinclair.

19:53.627 --> 19:56.653
Well, that used to be me.

19:56.730 --> 19:59.427
Let me introduce you
to your new family.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.491
- [gasps]
- This is your son Robbie.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.299
- How's it going?
- This is your daughter Charlene.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.930
- Hello.
- Your new baby.

20:06.006 --> 20:07.474
Where's the rest of him?

20:07.541 --> 20:09.771
And I believe you know Fran.

20:09.843 --> 20:12.813
You look gorgeous. I can't wait
to bite your husband's head off.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.872
Gary, I want you to know
something right away.

20:15.949 --> 20:19.112
I love Earl. He's the only male
I've ever loved.

20:19.186 --> 20:23.384
No matter what happens here,
he's the only male I ever will love.

20:23.457 --> 20:26.722
He looks kind of short
and dumpy from up here.

20:26.794 --> 20:28.819
- Watch it.
- That's my daddy.

20:28.896 --> 20:31.729
Well, from down here,
he looks just fine,

20:31.799 --> 20:34.461
which is more than
I can say about you,

20:34.535 --> 20:36.731
you insensitive, insecure, arrogant...

20:36.804 --> 20:40.172
Uh, honey, I was hoping
to avoid a lingering death.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.767
- Who do you think you are, anyway?
- The guy who carried your groceries.

20:43.844 --> 20:46.643
Besides, I'm not even interested in you.

20:46.714 --> 20:49.046
So I want you to go away.

20:49.116 --> 20:50.880
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

20:50.951 --> 20:53.443
Can I offer anybody coffee? Gary?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.955
Fran, I just thought...

20:56.023 --> 20:58.617
You thought? You thought nothing.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.286
If you thought at all,
you would have realized

21:01.361 --> 21:05.195
that this is my life,
my home, my family,

21:05.265 --> 21:07.734
and you have no right to take it away.

21:07.801 --> 21:09.200
[together] Yeah.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.204
Earl, you married this?

21:12.272 --> 21:14.001
19 years.

21:14.074 --> 21:17.567
19 years. You must be made of steel.

21:17.644 --> 21:21.103
She's had a hard day,
being widowed and all.

21:21.181 --> 21:24.173
Listen, Fran, Earl,
I just had a thought.

21:24.251 --> 21:26.015
Maybe I'm not ready to settle down.

21:26.086 --> 21:27.451
- What?
- Huh?

21:27.521 --> 21:29.011
You're not?

21:29.089 --> 21:30.716
All right, all right, I was,

21:30.791 --> 21:34.887
but I was looking for something
a little less... horrible.

21:34.962 --> 21:38.296
Hey, hey, that's our wife
you're talking about.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.890
She's all yours, Earl.

21:39.967 --> 21:43.631
All right, then maybe you
better just step off my porch.

21:43.704 --> 21:46.435
Yeah, and put those pine trees
back where you found them!

21:46.507 --> 21:48.339
Easy, honey, I think we won.

21:48.409 --> 21:51.106
Nice meeting you all.
Certainly been a pleasure.

21:51.178 --> 21:53.306
You've got
a beautiful family here, Earl.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.350
- Good luck with them.
- What a shrew.

21:56.417 --> 21:57.885
We use what we have.

21:57.951 --> 22:01.080
There's this big kid at school
who's been bothering me.

22:01.155 --> 22:03.783
Maybe you could come down
and teach him a lesson.

22:03.857 --> 22:05.154
Hold on there.

22:05.225 --> 22:08.160
I'm the father and if anybody's gonna
go to your school and beat up a kid,

22:08.228 --> 22:09.696
it's gonna be me.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.424
OK. Thanks, Dad. Cool.

22:14.735 --> 22:18.296
Still the daddy! Still the daddy!
Still the daddy!

22:18.372 --> 22:22.002
Oh, Earl.
You were so brave.

22:22.075 --> 22:25.010
Yeah. What moment exactly?

22:25.078 --> 22:28.378
You were willing to open that door
and face him.

22:28.449 --> 22:30.178
Yeah, I did do that, didn't 1?7

22:30.250 --> 22:32.719
I opened it right up
and I faced him.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.720
At least the part of him you could see.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.882
Did you notice his ankle
was trembling?

22:36.957 --> 22:38.482
No, I didn't,

22:38.559 --> 22:41.654
but I'd be happy to say so
in front of the neighbors.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.060
Aw, thanks, Frannie.

22:44.131 --> 22:47.362
You're worth fighting for.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.868
Oh!

22:48.936 --> 22:51.200
[kissing]

22:51.271 --> 22:54.730
- Oh.
- [chuckling]
