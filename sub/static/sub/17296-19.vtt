00:23.936 --> 00:25.634
Oh, man!

00:30.813 --> 00:32.858
Ha... Ha-ha.

00:33.511 --> 00:34.947
Listen up, Titans.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.080
Today, we need
to address an issue

00:37.124 --> 00:39.213
that all of you have
been neglecting.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.128
Personal hygiene.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.174
When it comes
to personal hygiene,

00:44.218 --> 00:46.307
there are four main
problem areas.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.222
Hair, face, teeth and hands,

00:48.265 --> 00:50.311
which you can remember
with this simple acronym.

00:54.315 --> 00:55.403
Say it with me.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.239
Excellent.
Now...

01:06.892 --> 01:08.677
Beast Boy, you need to do a better
job keeping your hair clean.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.200
That includes fur.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.594
You's asking too much
of me, fool.

01:12.637 --> 01:14.378
Cyborg, you need
to wash your face more.

01:14.422 --> 01:15.640
It's very oily.

01:15.684 --> 01:18.774
Because I oil it.
My face is half robot, man.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.906
I gotta lubricate.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.083
Raven, you need
to brush your teeth more.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.388
You have bad breath.

01:24.432 --> 01:27.130
I have evil breath.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.003
And last,
but certainly not least,

01:31.047 --> 01:32.353
Starfire.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.659
You, uh, know I don't like
finding fault with you,

01:34.703 --> 01:37.097
but we've got one more problem
area left to talk about.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.359
Hands.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.317
Come on, let's see them.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.190
They're spotless.

01:43.538 --> 01:46.454
Indeed. I have been
washing the hands quite often.

01:46.715 --> 01:50.501
Excellent. At least one of you understands
the importance of keeping germs at bay.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.677
Oh, you misunderstand.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.549
I have been washing the hands

01:54.592 --> 01:57.639
in the event that an evil witch casts a spell upon me

01:57.682 --> 02:00.207
and a handsome prince must kiss my hand

02:00.250 --> 02:03.340
to wake me from the slumber
and rescue me from the tower.

02:03.601 --> 02:04.602
Smart.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.604
I cannot approve of that.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.737
Hands are filthy appendages.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.435
Kissing them is a surefire
way to spread disease.

02:11.696 --> 02:14.525
But it is the most brief
of lip-to-hand contact.

02:14.569 --> 02:17.137
Allow me to demonstrate
by kissing upon your hand.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.790
I...

02:18.834 --> 02:20.140
I approve of that.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.535
Baby hands!

02:24.579 --> 02:27.321
Quiet!
This is my destiny.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.634
I will never wash this hand again.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.333
Okay, what about all that stuff
you just said about hygiene?

02:39.637 --> 02:43.119
None of that applies
to hands kissed by Starfire.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.208
Precious, precious kiss.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.384
I promise to protect you.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.604
Bro's, you gonna get mad stinky.

02:49.647 --> 02:53.303
Yeah. How are you gonna take a shower
without getting your hand wet?

02:53.347 --> 02:54.826
I'll bag it.

03:00.484 --> 03:01.964
Good evening, Titans.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.748
Ooh, crispy tots.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.408
Robin, it's been three months and
you still haven't washed your hand.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.149
So?

03:13.193 --> 03:16.065
We are concerned that your hand has
become hygienically-challenged.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.284
Impossible.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.242
The hand is bagged at all times.

03:19.286 --> 03:22.811
And the rubber band around my
wrist makes an airtight seal.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.770
That airtight seal is just
trapping germs in there.

03:25.814 --> 03:29.905
Indeed. You have created the environment
in which the bacterium flourish.

03:29.948 --> 03:34.910
Bro, your hand is probably gonna
fall off from all those bacteriums.

03:34.953 --> 03:38.261
That's ridiculous.
My hand isn't going to fall off.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.481
It was perfectly clean
when I put it in the bag.

03:40.524 --> 03:43.135
Therefore, it must still
be perfectly clean.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.094
Prove it.
Take off the bag.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.791
Break the seal?
Are you crazy?

03:47.183 --> 03:49.925
I can't risk exposing the kiss.

03:51.405 --> 03:54.277
Take off the bag!
Take off the bag!

03:54.321 --> 03:56.279
Take off the bag!
Take off...

03:56.323 --> 03:58.542
Okay, okay.
I'll show you.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.764
See? It's fine.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.985
Dude, your hand just fell off!

04:07.029 --> 04:09.074
No. No, no, no, no, no!
This is terrible!

04:09.118 --> 04:10.728
I love that hand!

04:10.772 --> 04:13.862
Now all I have is this worthless left one.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.081
Don't look at me like that.
You know how I feel.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.433
It's okay, dude. Lots of cool
guys only have one hand.

04:19.476 --> 04:22.262
Like Rick Allen, or a pirate or...
Did that thing just move?

04:26.396 --> 04:28.920
My hand... It's alive.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.053
True love's kiss...

04:32.446 --> 04:33.838
Of course! It's the only
thing that makes sense.

04:33.882 --> 04:36.058
Because Starfire is a princess,

04:36.101 --> 04:39.888
her true love's kiss must have
awakened my hand from its slumber.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.457
It's probably moving because it's
infected by so much bacteria.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.763
Like a hand zombie.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.462
It's just a matter of time before that hand zombie tries to eat someone's brains.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.552
That's not a hand zombie!

04:51.595 --> 04:53.336
It's fairy tale magic.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.384
Therefore, I will never wash it,
whether it is attached to me or not.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.951
Dude, it's just a
mindless hand zombie.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.302
Oh, yeah?
Hand, do a flip.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.784
Can a mindless
hand zombie do that?

05:06.828 --> 05:09.178
Gee, I don't know, I've never
seen a hand zombie before.

05:09.483 --> 05:10.788
Crime alert.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.877
Mind lending a "hand"?

05:14.618 --> 05:17.229
Titans, and hand, go!

05:22.974 --> 05:24.802
We'll "handle" this one.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.424
Nice. Pound it.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.784
Whoo-hoo.
Such martial prowess.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.184
No!

06:01.230 --> 06:02.449
Too close.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.451
That water could've rinsed
Starfire's kiss off.

06:04.494 --> 06:07.062
The enchantment that gives
you life would disappear.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.413
Again, there's no enchantment.
It's a hand zombie.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.547
We need to be more careful.
Here, let's get you back in the bag.

06:14.678 --> 06:18.073
Hey, you're my hand
and I say, get in the bag.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.817
Such confidence.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.471
Fine. If you're not
going in the bag,

06:24.514 --> 06:26.951
just stay away from water,
soap, anti-bacterial gel,

06:26.995 --> 06:31.521
moist towelettes or anything else that might
wash away the kiss that brings you life.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.352
Hand!

06:36.396 --> 06:37.527
Hand!

06:38.485 --> 06:40.356
Hey, have you guys seen my hand?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.445
The magic one, not this one.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.014
- I think it's in the shower.
- The shower?

06:47.668 --> 06:50.018
Hand! You'd better be
wearing a bag in there.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.499
If you washed off
Starfire's kiss...

06:55.502 --> 06:56.938
No!

06:56.981 --> 06:58.635
No!

06:59.375 --> 07:01.986
Starfire's kiss
has been washed away.

07:03.988 --> 07:07.688
Now you will fade back
into eternal slumber.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.342
Rest gently, dear friend.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.518
Rest now.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.392
Why aren't you resting gently?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.915
Hand, are you prepared?

07:17.959 --> 07:19.700
Prepared, for what?

07:19.743 --> 07:21.397
Hand and I have
the date tonight.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.138
You and my hand have a date?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.228
- You and my hand have a date?
- Yes.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.665
We have the mutually reciprocating
feelings of the romance.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.538
- You and my hand?
- Yes.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.453
You...
You and my hand...

07:33.496 --> 07:34.497
- Yes.
- Are going on a date?

07:34.541 --> 07:35.977
- That is correct.
- You and my hand?

07:36.020 --> 07:38.066
- Yes.
- You and my hand?

07:38.109 --> 07:39.110
Yes.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.722
- Can I come?
- No.

07:43.158 --> 07:47.118
I am sorry, Robin. But three is
a number that is often crowded.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.038
You makes a beautiful couple.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.736
You kids have fun now!

07:55.779 --> 07:56.954
So happy for you.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.217
You guys knew about this?

07:59.261 --> 08:01.176
- It was kinda obvious.
- Saw it coming a mile away.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.091
Ever since that
fateful first kiss.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.833
Oh. You could just feel the
chemistry between those two.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.444
How could I have been so blind?

08:08.488 --> 08:11.621
All this time I thought that
hand was an enchanted gift.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.362
Instead, it was a...

08:13.405 --> 08:15.364
Oh, no.
Star's in trouble.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.478
Thank you, the hand.

08:46.482 --> 08:49.572
I really have
to "hand" it to you.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.531
You had us all fooled.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.663
Robin, please, do not
ruin the pleasant evening

08:53.707 --> 08:56.013
with the jealouses
and the hand puns.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.625
Star, that hand
didn't want a date.

08:58.668 --> 08:59.800
It wants your brain.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.541
It's a hand zombie!

09:06.502 --> 09:08.417
Hand-to-hand combat, it is.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.688
You've left me no other choice.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.864
I'm biting a hand that feeds me.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.567
No! Not the brain!

09:48.892 --> 09:50.590
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yes!

09:54.594 --> 09:56.073
You saved our brains.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.641
That hand of yours was planning
on going after all of us.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.643
I'm sorry, Titans.

10:00.687 --> 10:04.865
I put fairy tales ahead of hygiene and
unknowingly let my hand become a zombie.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.562
I'll never let it happen again.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.260
But you did the savings
of my brain.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.741
Please, allow me
to express the gratitude.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.570
Bag it!
