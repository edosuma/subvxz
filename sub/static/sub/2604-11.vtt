00:01.553 --> 00:03.622
When I was 11,
my parents were involved

00:03.690 --> 00:05.257
in a really horrible accident.

00:05.325 --> 00:06.258
My grandmother took me in.

00:06.326 --> 00:07.626
It's your grandma.

00:07.694 --> 00:09.027
She passed away.

00:09.095 --> 00:11.563
Either Jessica will retain
her position,

00:11.631 --> 00:13.799
or I will resume control
of Pearson Hardman.

00:13.867 --> 00:16.902
I'm entitled to name
one new senior partner a year.

00:16.970 --> 00:20.572
If you are on the wrong side,
there'll be no coming back.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.275
The managing partner
is Daniel Hardman.

00:23.343 --> 00:25.210
Jessica lost!
You lost!

00:25.278 --> 00:27.559
Are you looking for another
way to make my life miserable?

00:27.614 --> 00:29.455
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you.

00:29.516 --> 00:31.316
Well, Harvey never tried
to sleep with Ted Phillips.

00:31.384 --> 00:32.651
Ms. Sheila Sazs.

00:32.719 --> 00:35.087
I think Louis is attracted
to female Louis.

00:35.155 --> 00:36.989
- I'm Tess.
- You guys must go way back.

00:37.056 --> 00:39.291
First beer, prom, sex.

00:39.359 --> 00:41.226
Your grandmother just died.

00:41.294 --> 00:42.327
When something
like that happens,

00:42.395 --> 00:44.263
people don't make
smart choices.

00:44.330 --> 00:45.998
- You're married.
- And you called me anyway.

00:46.065 --> 00:47.933
What if Hardman planted
the CM memo

00:48.001 --> 00:49.368
in the first place?

00:49.436 --> 00:51.436
All those in favor
of Daniel Hardman's dismissal...

00:51.471 --> 00:53.672
[Knock on door]

00:53.740 --> 00:57.209
I don't care
about being smart.

01:12.759 --> 01:14.393
[Laughs]

01:14.461 --> 01:17.029
Fyi, we're out of pizza.

01:17.096 --> 01:18.797
You're telling me this now?

01:18.865 --> 01:21.099
I didn't know
you were gonna get high.

01:21.167 --> 01:22.634
You mean you didn't know
<i>we</i> were gonna get high.

01:22.702 --> 01:25.571
Oh, does this mean you're
not going back to work tomorrow?

01:25.638 --> 01:27.506
No, it means I'm celebrating
going back to work tomorrow.

01:27.574 --> 01:29.208
Fine.

01:29.275 --> 01:31.076
But don't think I don't know
what you're really doing.

01:31.144 --> 01:33.445
What, getting you high,
so I can get into your pants

01:33.513 --> 01:35.614
or under your sheet
or whatever?

01:35.682 --> 01:37.249
I meant you're afraid.

01:37.317 --> 01:39.685
Afraid? Nope.

01:39.752 --> 01:41.987
I'm not afraid,
I can't wait to get back.

01:42.055 --> 01:44.423
You can't wait to get back
to talk to Rachel?

01:44.491 --> 01:47.192
I am not afraid
to talk to Rachel.

01:47.260 --> 01:48.894
And I'm not afraid
of the big, bad wolf.

01:48.962 --> 01:50.629
Look, I told you,
she's a friend.

01:50.697 --> 01:52.931
She was just coming
to check up on me, that's all.

01:52.999 --> 01:54.366
And I told you
I believed you.

01:54.434 --> 01:56.535
You're welcome.

01:56.603 --> 01:59.104
So why can't you just keep
pretending you believe me now?

01:59.172 --> 02:03.642
Because you have
to go back to work tomorrow.

02:03.710 --> 02:08.580
And your husband gets back
in town tomorrow.

02:08.648 --> 02:09.848
- You want more pizza?
- Let's order more pizza.

02:09.916 --> 02:12.818
- Yeah.
- Great.

02:29.202 --> 02:30.769
Somebody give you
a promotion?

02:30.837 --> 02:32.571
Somebody should.

02:32.639 --> 02:35.841
Lopez buyout delayed,
Phillips merger closed.

02:35.909 --> 02:38.944
Oh, and Zoe Lawford called,
which is odd,

02:39.012 --> 02:40.512
because I don't remember us
having a trial

02:40.580 --> 02:42.347
we needed
consulting services on.

02:42.415 --> 02:43.615
So that's why you're sitting
at my desk.

02:43.683 --> 02:44.750
I wanted to be
in a position of power

02:44.817 --> 02:49.054
when I toyed with you.

02:49.122 --> 02:50.289
Let's get one thing clear.

02:50.356 --> 02:51.924
I'm not Charlie Brown,

02:51.991 --> 02:53.859
you're not Lucy,
and that's not a football.

02:53.927 --> 02:55.761
Let's get
two things clear.

02:55.828 --> 02:58.597
I don't remember
ever placing a call to Zoe,

02:58.665 --> 03:00.899
but her message said
she was calling back.

03:00.967 --> 03:03.101
I called her.
For business.

03:03.169 --> 03:05.938
What kind of business?
A merger?

03:06.005 --> 03:07.406
Okay, what are you,
12 years old?

03:07.473 --> 03:08.440
I'm not the one
robbing the cradle here.

03:08.508 --> 03:09.808
I'm not robbing anything.

03:09.876 --> 03:11.476
Zoe and I are the same age.
So you admit it.

03:11.544 --> 03:12.784
You called to ask her
on a date.

03:12.845 --> 03:14.379
Behind my back.
It wasn't behind your back.

03:14.447 --> 03:15.781
You'd gone home already.

03:15.848 --> 03:16.949
Because you waited
for me to go home.

03:17.016 --> 03:21.320
Like I said,
it was behind your back.

03:21.387 --> 03:23.589
Harvey,
just out of curiosity,

03:23.656 --> 03:25.924
what took you so long
to call her?

03:25.992 --> 03:27.426
I had my hands full
with Hardman.

03:27.493 --> 03:29.227
Well, now you're hands full
of her.

03:29.295 --> 03:30.963
Look, now it's over,
I want to celebrate.

03:31.030 --> 03:32.397
And she's the person
I want to do it with.

03:32.465 --> 03:34.466
Are you gonna tell her that?

03:34.534 --> 03:36.134
I assume you heard

03:36.202 --> 03:37.102
that the Lopez buyout
was delayed?

03:37.170 --> 03:38.437
So I'm gonna need some--

03:38.504 --> 03:39.771
Louis, I don't give a shit
what you need.

03:39.839 --> 03:41.006
All right, Harvey,
you know what?

03:41.074 --> 03:42.608
Look, it's been a week.

03:42.675 --> 03:44.776
You won, you know,
get over it.

03:44.844 --> 03:45.944
Get out.

03:46.012 --> 03:47.312
You know,
for your information,

03:47.380 --> 03:49.348
I wasn't the only senior partner
who voted for Hardman.

03:49.415 --> 03:50.415
And I don't see you giving
anyone else shit

03:50.483 --> 03:51.683
the way you give me.

03:51.751 --> 03:53.485
And by the way,
when the chips were down,

03:53.553 --> 03:55.087
I backed you,
I ousted him.

03:55.154 --> 03:59.658
You mean
when you did this?

03:59.726 --> 04:00.659
Tell yourself
whatever you want, Louis,

04:00.727 --> 04:03.562
but tell it to yourself.

04:17.877 --> 04:19.478
You here
to rip the band-aid off?

04:19.545 --> 04:23.015
It's what grammy always said
to do when you have a boo-boo.

04:23.082 --> 04:24.316
Really?

04:24.384 --> 04:28.420
You're gonna use her
to get out of this?

04:28.488 --> 04:30.455
Look, Rachel, I understand
that you're mad at me.

04:30.523 --> 04:32.491
No, I'm not.

04:32.558 --> 04:33.992
What's that expression?

04:34.060 --> 04:35.293
"Fool me once,
shame on you.

04:35.361 --> 04:36.962
Fool me twice--"

04:37.030 --> 04:38.296
nobody's fooling anybody.

04:38.364 --> 04:40.532
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

04:40.600 --> 04:41.967
For what I saw
or what you did?

04:42.035 --> 04:43.402
Rachel, come on.

04:43.469 --> 04:44.803
I'm just trying to--
let me just ask you this.

04:44.871 --> 04:46.405
Does she know that six hours
before you screwed her,

04:46.472 --> 04:49.274
you tried to screw me?

04:49.342 --> 04:51.943
Okay, let's not pretend
that this is about her, okay?

04:52.011 --> 04:53.845
So she knows,
or she doesn't?

04:53.913 --> 04:55.113
I mean, is it fair to her

04:55.181 --> 04:56.481
that she was your second choice
that night?

04:56.549 --> 04:59.418
Because if I were her, Mike--
She's married.

04:59.485 --> 05:00.519
I don't think
she's really worried

05:00.586 --> 05:06.091
about being
my second choice.

05:06.159 --> 05:07.859
Welcome back.

05:07.927 --> 05:09.294
Who's ready
for a great first day?

05:09.362 --> 05:10.862
Harvey, can you give us
a minute, please?

05:10.930 --> 05:12.698
I can't.
We actually have a crisis.

05:12.765 --> 05:14.232
We gotta go.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.535
Come on.

05:16.602 --> 05:19.805
[Clears throat]

05:24.444 --> 05:27.946
You once told me
you could fix anything, Harvey.

05:28.014 --> 05:29.915
This is my son, Liam.

05:29.982 --> 05:34.252
Your mother says
you have a problem.

05:34.320 --> 05:38.090
Um, I was driving home
from Greenwich last night.

05:38.157 --> 05:40.859
A friend's party.

05:40.927 --> 05:44.129
I hit someone.

05:44.197 --> 05:45.363
I-I didn't see him.

05:45.431 --> 05:46.865
He came out of nowhere.
Were you drunk?

05:46.933 --> 05:48.500
Don't answer that.

05:48.568 --> 05:50.902
If this comes to trial,
I can't put him on the stand.

05:50.970 --> 05:52.270
But I wasn't drinking.

05:52.338 --> 05:53.438
And if we asked everybody else
at the party,

05:53.506 --> 05:55.373
would they tell
the same story?

05:55.441 --> 05:57.542
If it comes out,
we need to know.

05:57.610 --> 05:59.444
Talk to anyone
who was there.

05:59.512 --> 06:01.880
What if I checked your car
for beer bottles right now?

06:01.948 --> 06:03.815
Go ahead.
Check anything you want.

06:03.883 --> 06:05.450
I'm telling the truth.

06:05.518 --> 06:08.620
Okay, it was an accident.
We can deal with this.

06:08.688 --> 06:13.291
Tell me, what happened
to the guy you hit?

06:13.359 --> 06:15.627
I don't know.

06:15.695 --> 06:18.630
- That's why we called you.
- What do you mean?

06:18.698 --> 06:21.032

all the hospitals...

06:56.824 --> 06:58.324
I think you need
to sit this one out.

06:58.792 --> 07:00.726
Look,
I know I jumped the gun,

07:00.794 --> 07:02.161
but one wrong question
and I'm out?

07:02.229 --> 07:04.163
You weren't jumping the gun,
it set you off.

07:04.231 --> 07:05.698
Harvey, I'm fine.

07:05.766 --> 07:07.133
Look, I'm not blaming you,
I'm understanding you.

07:07.201 --> 07:09.101
Your parents were killed
by a drunk driver.

07:09.169 --> 07:11.137
- And Liam said he wasn't drunk.
- Doesn't matter.

07:11.205 --> 07:12.538
Your emotions get
the better of you on a merger.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.240
Gillian's a longtime client.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.242
It's her only son,
I can't have that.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.710
I can do this.

07:17.778 --> 07:20.780
Your grandmother
just died.

07:20.848 --> 07:22.582
I said I'm onboard.

07:22.649 --> 07:25.585
I'm onboard.

07:30.557 --> 07:32.091
So what do you think?

07:32.159 --> 07:34.193
The damage helps us.
It's minimal.

07:34.261 --> 07:37.663
More importantly,
if the impact was central,

07:37.731 --> 07:39.499
guy would have been directly
in your field of vision,

07:39.566 --> 07:42.668
so this backs the story up.
He came out of nowhere.

07:42.736 --> 07:45.037
Albert Chung was rushed
to the E.R. last night,

07:45.105 --> 07:47.106
after a 911 call.

07:47.174 --> 07:49.242
- You called 911?
- Yeah.

07:49.309 --> 07:50.710
You should have
told us that.

07:50.777 --> 07:53.045
He has a concussion,
contusions, four cracked ribs,

07:53.113 --> 07:54.313
but he's stable.

07:54.381 --> 07:56.148
Thank God,
so it's okay.

07:56.216 --> 07:58.417
Gillian,
Liam needs to turn himself in.

07:58.485 --> 08:00.219
It was an accident.

08:00.287 --> 08:02.288
Exactly,
so if he comes forward,

08:02.356 --> 08:03.456
he's a 20-year-old kid
who freaked out,

08:03.524 --> 08:04.323
but now he's doing
the right thing.

08:04.391 --> 08:05.625
Harvey's right.

08:05.692 --> 08:07.159
If they come to us,
which I know they will,

08:07.227 --> 08:09.395
we'll be on the defensive,
we'll never recover.

08:09.463 --> 08:10.997
- Shit.
- You can't know that.

08:11.064 --> 08:12.632
They might never find him.

08:12.699 --> 08:14.467
You really want to risk
your son's life on that?

08:14.535 --> 08:18.471
I'm sorry,
but isn't this Liam's decision?

08:24.878 --> 08:27.580
- What's gonna happen to me?
- I don't know.

08:27.648 --> 08:29.482
But if you're worried
about prison movies,

08:29.550 --> 08:31.050
that's not
what's gonna happen.

08:31.118 --> 08:32.217
How do you know that?

08:32.285 --> 08:34.620
Because I know Harvey.

08:34.688 --> 08:35.922
I don't know.

08:35.989 --> 08:37.990
I don't know.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.726
Hey, believe it or not,

08:40.794 --> 08:42.461
I've been where you are
right now.

08:42.529 --> 08:44.430
What?

08:44.498 --> 08:46.699
Yeah.
I was 16.

08:46.767 --> 08:50.937
Got busted for possession,
1/2 ounce.

08:51.004 --> 08:52.044
[Chuckles]
I was so scared.

08:52.105 --> 08:54.206
You smoke?

08:54.274 --> 08:57.777
I did.

08:57.844 --> 09:00.613
I do.

09:00.681 --> 09:02.715
But you
didn't hurt anybody.

09:02.783 --> 09:04.617
I know it feels
like there's no way out.

09:04.685 --> 09:05.885
But I'm telling you,

09:05.953 --> 09:09.689
you're going to be home
in time for dinner.

09:13.894 --> 09:16.162
I must say,
I'm so glad you called.

09:16.229 --> 09:19.231
- I'm so glad you answered.
- I'm glad you're glad.

09:19.299 --> 09:21.219
When were you gonna tell me
about your promotion?

09:21.234 --> 09:22.435
You know
about my promotion?

09:22.502 --> 09:24.070
Senior partnerships
rocket to my ears

09:24.137 --> 09:25.438
with the speed
of a late-night bullet.

09:25.505 --> 09:27.306
- Really?
- I read it on Twitter.

09:27.374 --> 09:28.574
From the moment
I laid eyes on you,

09:28.642 --> 09:30.076
I could tell
you were a baller.

09:30.143 --> 09:32.745
Oh, I ball,
which is why I called you.

09:32.813 --> 09:34.714
One of the perks
of my new title--

09:34.781 --> 09:36.115
Say it.

09:36.183 --> 09:38.317
[Whispering]
Senior partner.

09:38.385 --> 09:39.452
Go on.

09:39.519 --> 09:42.321
I get to hire
an associate of my own.

09:42.389 --> 09:44.357
A Boy Wonder
to my Batman.

09:44.424 --> 09:45.825
Well, I am with you,
Dark Knight.

09:45.892 --> 09:47.360
I want you
to send me the best of the best.

09:47.427 --> 09:48.667
I've already
lined up interviews

09:48.695 --> 09:50.016
with my top five
recent graduates.

09:50.030 --> 09:52.565
- Have you?
- Figure of speech.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.300
But, I have to say,
I was hoping you didn't call

09:54.368 --> 09:56.235
exclusively for business.

09:56.303 --> 09:57.837
I was hoping
you were hoping that.

09:57.904 --> 09:59.304
I'm gonna be honest
with you, Louis.

09:59.339 --> 10:01.007
Senior partner has
a certain sex appeal

10:01.074 --> 10:02.508
junior partner doesn't.

10:02.576 --> 10:07.780
I thought that
to myself about myself.

10:07.848 --> 10:09.448
Room 405.

10:09.516 --> 10:11.050
9:00 p.m. tomorrow.

10:11.118 --> 10:16.522
Bring coconut oil,
a ski mask, and duct tape.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.995
[Whispering]
Fear never felt so good.

10:27.034 --> 10:28.401
Katrina Bennett.

10:28.468 --> 10:32.138
- Harvey Specter.
- Nice to meet you.

10:32.205 --> 10:34.140
Your record is something
of a legend around here.

10:34.207 --> 10:35.675
Excellent.

10:35.742 --> 10:38.077
I hope we can extend each other
some professional courtesy.

10:38.145 --> 10:39.478
I'm not extending you
anything.

10:39.546 --> 10:40.880
Of course.

10:40.947 --> 10:43.149
What better thing to do
than to take down a legend?

10:43.216 --> 10:44.583
Well, I'm glad
we understand each other.

10:44.651 --> 10:47.119
We do,
but here's the problem.

10:47.187 --> 10:48.754
This isn't the case for it.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.890
It's a misdemeanor,
leaving the scene,

10:50.957 --> 10:52.892
and now
he's turned himself in.

10:52.959 --> 10:54.727
Because you knew
we'd trace the 911 call.

10:54.795 --> 10:56.729
That's not why.
He feels terrible.

10:56.797 --> 10:57.963
He feels afraid.

10:58.031 --> 10:59.298
Not the same thing.

10:59.366 --> 11:01.000
Katrina, I understand
you want to take me out,

11:01.068 --> 11:02.568
but this is an accident.

11:02.636 --> 11:04.670
Liam made a mistake,
and he's rectifying it.

11:04.738 --> 11:06.505
We'll accept
maximum community service

11:06.573 --> 11:08.374
and whatever fine
you deem appropriate.

11:08.442 --> 11:10.009
And what
about funeral costs?

11:10.077 --> 11:11.444
Wait. What?

11:11.511 --> 11:13.612
He died?

11:13.680 --> 11:15.114
Which makes it
felony hit-and-run.

11:15.182 --> 11:16.949
He was stable.

11:17.017 --> 11:18.184
His concussion led
to a brain bleed.

11:18.251 --> 11:20.252
That man's death
doesn't change the fact

11:20.320 --> 11:21.654
that it was an accident.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.456
Felony hit-and-run,
under these circumstances,

11:23.523 --> 11:25.691
is 12 to 15 years.

11:25.759 --> 11:28.260
You wanted courtesy?
Here it is.

11:28.328 --> 11:29.895
I'll go ten.

11:29.963 --> 11:32.031
That's crazy.
It was dark.

11:32.099 --> 11:33.866
He wasn't drinking.

11:33.934 --> 11:39.338
Tell me it's not
what you would have offered.

11:44.615 --> 11:45.782
Maria Monroe.

11:45.850 --> 11:47.370
Secretary of your class
at Harvard Law.

11:48.202 --> 11:49.836
Clerked
for Chief Justice Roberts.

11:49.904 --> 11:52.272
Glowing letters
of recommendation.

11:52.340 --> 11:55.842
You think this impresses me?

11:55.910 --> 11:57.110
Negative.

11:57.178 --> 11:58.211
Which means you have
exactly five minutes

11:58.279 --> 11:59.846
to convince me
that you're the one.

11:59.914 --> 12:02.316
I don't need five minutes.
I am the one.

12:02.383 --> 12:04.351
It's you who's on the clock,
Louis.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.987
I have standing offers from
the top three firms in the city.

12:07.055 --> 12:08.488
Pearson Hardman
is a top-three firm.

12:08.556 --> 12:09.890
Well,
I used to think so.

12:09.958 --> 12:11.425
But if it's taking you this long
to meet with me,

12:11.492 --> 12:12.960
maybe you're slipping.

12:13.027 --> 12:15.028
Oh, no, I'm not--
[Stammers] We're not slipping.

12:15.096 --> 12:17.197
You need to submit
a formal offer by noon tomorrow

12:17.265 --> 12:19.433
if you want me
to even consider working here.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.002
Wh-- Maria,
hold on a second.

12:22.070 --> 12:25.005
Just wait right there,
wait right there.

12:25.073 --> 12:26.640
You four, beat it.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.242
Position has been filled.

12:29.310 --> 12:30.744
I'll beat any salary by 50%.

12:30.812 --> 12:31.912
25,000 signing bonus.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.414
- Put it in writing.
- W-w-w--

12:34.482 --> 12:36.516
don't you want me
to give you a tour of the firm?

12:36.584 --> 12:37.864
Show you
where you'll be working?

12:37.885 --> 12:39.086
Well, I don't care
where I'd be working

12:39.153 --> 12:40.320
because I'm a machine.

12:40.388 --> 12:42.556
I have to have you.

12:42.623 --> 12:44.825
That's what they all say.

12:44.892 --> 12:47.561
Police report,
photos of the intersection,

12:47.628 --> 12:48.762
coroner's report.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.163
This isn't sixth-grade math.

12:50.231 --> 12:51.732
Don't show me your work,
just give me the answer.

12:51.799 --> 12:53.834
God, I wish I had you
in the sixth grade.

12:53.901 --> 12:56.203
Except, no--
Miss Jenson, very hot.

12:56.270 --> 12:57.704
You need a minute alone?

12:57.772 --> 13:02.142
There was a reason that Liam
did not see Albert Chung.

13:02.210 --> 13:05.579
He was wearing a hooded
sweatshirt, jeans, and sneakers.

13:05.646 --> 13:07.047
All black.

13:07.115 --> 13:08.715
Guy couldn't have been harder
to see if he was trying.

13:08.783 --> 13:09.950
Maybe he <i>was</i> trying.

13:10.018 --> 13:12.119
Albert Chung was
an art school dropout.

13:12.186 --> 13:14.221
Look at that graffiti
on the wall.

13:14.288 --> 13:16.156
"A.C."
Albert Chung.

13:16.224 --> 13:17.224
He was trying
to be invisible

13:17.291 --> 13:18.525
because he was tagging
that building.

13:18.593 --> 13:20.160
And he was running away
when he got hit.

13:20.228 --> 13:21.561
Which means
Liam didn't cause the accident,

13:21.629 --> 13:23.063
Albert Chung did.

13:23.131 --> 13:25.499
I think you missed
your calling as a fake cop.

13:25.566 --> 13:27.768
Going back to that well again?
Okay.

13:27.835 --> 13:29.636
So what are you gonna do?
Stick it to Katrina?

13:29.704 --> 13:30.804
No, <i>you're</i> gonna stick it
to Katrina.

13:30.872 --> 13:32.139
You heard her.

13:32.206 --> 13:34.508
Her agenda isn't
just prosecuting Liam,

13:34.575 --> 13:35.642
it's beating me.

13:35.710 --> 13:37.230
See, I'm taking
the personal out of it.

13:37.245 --> 13:39.746
Your problem is,
you put the personal into it.

13:39.814 --> 13:40.847
Okay,
I thought my problem

13:40.915 --> 13:42.682
was showing you my work
unnecessarily.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.584
Who said
there's only one problem?

13:44.652 --> 13:47.521
Well played.

13:50.224 --> 13:51.425
Felony hit-and-run hinges

13:51.492 --> 13:53.727
on a lack
of contributory negligence.

13:53.795 --> 13:55.395
Albert Chung was fleeing
a crime scene.

13:55.463 --> 13:56.730
He put himself
in harm's way.

13:56.798 --> 13:59.299
So your client
can't be held responsible?

13:59.367 --> 14:00.200
We'll plead to misdemeanor
leaving the scene,

14:00.268 --> 14:01.701
but that's all.

14:01.769 --> 14:04.738
I'm going to do you a favor
and take this deal.

14:04.806 --> 14:07.441
You're not doing me a favor,
you're doing yourself a favor.

14:07.508 --> 14:08.542
We've got you.

14:08.609 --> 14:10.043
Got me or not,
it's no secret

14:10.111 --> 14:11.978
the D.A. and Harvey had
a run-in.

14:12.046 --> 14:13.407
He finds out
this is Harvey's case,

14:13.448 --> 14:14.581
it goes to trial.

14:14.649 --> 14:16.349
And anything can happen
at trial,

14:16.417 --> 14:17.684
so let me be clear,

14:17.752 --> 14:20.687
I am doing you a favor.

14:20.755 --> 14:22.155
What do you want?

14:22.223 --> 14:24.424
To make the same career jump
Harvey did.

14:24.492 --> 14:25.892
To corporate litigation?

14:25.960 --> 14:26.893
To Pearson Hardman.

14:26.961 --> 14:28.695
Wait, I thought you--

14:28.763 --> 14:30.664
That I wanted
to kick Harvey's ass?

14:30.731 --> 14:31.832
I said that
because you don't impress

14:31.899 --> 14:33.600
a lawyer like Harvey
with flowers.

14:33.668 --> 14:37.070
Look, this is a fair plea.

14:37.138 --> 14:38.438
And it's one
that should go through.

14:38.506 --> 14:40.140
I'll make sure
that it does.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.042
And if you were
to put a word in with Harvey,

14:42.110 --> 14:46.980
I would appreciate it.

14:47.048 --> 14:48.148
You got
to be kidding me.

14:48.216 --> 14:49.583
She actually said that?
Yeah.

14:49.650 --> 14:52.385
I don't know if I settled a case
or agreed to a bribe.

14:52.453 --> 14:54.121
- Did she sign the plea offer?
- Yeah.

14:54.188 --> 14:56.756
Then, "A," because she
can't rescind that thing

14:56.824 --> 14:58.792
unless new evidence
comes to light,

14:58.860 --> 15:00.127
and I don't have
to interview her for shit.

15:00.194 --> 15:02.062
- Good.
- Yeah, good.

15:02.130 --> 15:04.331
I don't want to hire
another associate ever again.

15:04.398 --> 15:06.600
The one I picked
causes me enough headaches.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.034
Oh, right,
like winning cases?

15:08.102 --> 15:10.637
Graffiti, man in black--
is that ringing any bells?

15:10.705 --> 15:12.005
It does indeed,

15:12.073 --> 15:14.241
which leads us
to our next assignment,

15:14.308 --> 15:15.742
should you choose
to accept it.

15:15.810 --> 15:17.244
Please tell me
you're about to self-destruct.

15:17.311 --> 15:21.448
We need to settle
with the Chung family.

15:21.516 --> 15:23.250
Harvey,
their son just died.

15:23.317 --> 15:26.219
I know, and I also know
that grief comes in stages,

15:26.287 --> 15:28.121
and the best time to settle
is before it gets to anger.

15:28.189 --> 15:29.923
You mean the best time
to take advantage of them

15:29.991 --> 15:31.291
is before it
gets to anger.

15:31.359 --> 15:33.293
- That's not--
- Our concern?

15:33.361 --> 15:35.195
I know we got Liam
out of prison,

15:35.263 --> 15:37.564
but he still hit a guy,
and that guy is still dead.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.232
And we still
represent Liam.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.301
Harvey...

15:41.369 --> 15:44.171
I know it's not
the same situation, but...

15:44.238 --> 15:48.041
I remember the day
the lawyer came to our place.

15:48.109 --> 15:50.076
Nick Rinaldi.
I...

15:50.144 --> 15:52.746
I remember his dirty shoes.
I...

15:52.813 --> 15:54.253
I remember
how they scraped the floor

15:54.315 --> 15:55.515
when he walked
into the living room

15:55.583 --> 15:56.816
to tell my grandmother

15:56.884 --> 16:00.687
how much my parents' lives
were worth.

16:00.755 --> 16:03.223
I've been
where these people are.

16:03.291 --> 16:06.560
Let me be the one
to tell them.

16:06.627 --> 16:08.228
You sure
you can handle it?

16:08.296 --> 16:09.396
I'm sure as hell
not going

16:09.463 --> 16:10.363
to leave them
to the likes of you.

16:10.431 --> 16:14.067
Okay,
you can handle it.

16:14.135 --> 16:17.237
You're authorized
to go as high as $100,000.

16:31.719 --> 16:35.589
Divorce is on 43.

16:35.656 --> 16:37.857
Look, I know
that you're mad at me,

16:37.925 --> 16:40.093
and I never meant
to put you in this situation,

16:40.161 --> 16:41.795
but I would
really appreciate it

16:41.862 --> 16:43.897
if you kept what I told you
to yourself.

16:43.965 --> 16:46.299
[Laughs]
Let me get this straight.

16:46.367 --> 16:47.934
You hit on me,

16:48.002 --> 16:50.337
then you run into the arms
of some married woman,

16:50.404 --> 16:51.972
you come waltzing
into my office

16:52.039 --> 16:53.473
trying to cutesy your way
out of it,

16:53.541 --> 16:54.808
and now you have the nerve

16:54.875 --> 16:58.845
to think I'm gonna go
and tell other people?

17:00.481 --> 17:01.848
[Box hittable]

17:01.916 --> 17:03.617
I have no idea what
you're gonna tell other people,

17:03.684 --> 17:04.751
but you sure seem
to have the ability

17:04.819 --> 17:06.619
to judge everything
that I do.

17:06.686 --> 17:08.421
Do you think that you have
the lock on bad decisions?

17:08.489 --> 17:10.128
All I know
is I'm not little miss perfect.

17:10.156 --> 17:13.526
I've had
an affair before too.

17:13.594 --> 17:15.494
You see the look
on your face?

17:15.563 --> 17:17.030
Who's judging who now,
Mike?

17:17.098 --> 17:19.699
And, no, it was not
some 50-year-old man

17:19.767 --> 17:22.102
trying to take advantage
of poor, young me.

17:22.169 --> 17:27.574
We were the same age,
and I went after him.

17:27.642 --> 17:31.811
I am not the goody-goody
you think I am.

17:31.879 --> 17:35.582
You have no idea
what you passed on.

17:38.119 --> 17:39.452
And I'll tell you something,
Mike.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.389
What you're doing,
it only ends one way.

17:50.271 --> 17:52.684
Ms. Chung,
I just want you to know

17:52.686 --> 17:55.788
that Liam Colson is devastated
by this accident,

17:55.855 --> 17:57.723
regardless of who caused it.

17:57.791 --> 17:59.325
Thank you.

17:59.392 --> 18:01.360
I know that there's
no amount of money

18:01.428 --> 18:03.495
that can ever
make up for it...

18:03.563 --> 18:06.532
and that this is
probably the last thing

18:06.599 --> 18:08.067
you want to be talking about.

18:08.134 --> 18:11.203
My brother wasn't exactly
a model citizen, Mr. Ross.

18:11.271 --> 18:13.839
We know he's not entitled
to much.

18:13.907 --> 18:16.442
All my parents want is
to pay off Albert's debts

18:16.509 --> 18:18.644
and cover
the funeral costs.

18:18.712 --> 18:20.679
And how much would that be?

18:20.747 --> 18:24.750
$20,000.

18:27.053 --> 18:31.323
Well, I'd like
to offer you $100,000.

18:31.391 --> 18:35.594
In fact, I insist on it.

18:35.662 --> 18:39.498
[Speaking in Cantonese]

18:49.075 --> 18:54.046
[Speaking in Cantonese]

18:56.416 --> 18:57.583
Where do we sign?

18:57.650 --> 18:59.184
Um...

18:59.252 --> 19:02.554
Right here and here.

19:02.622 --> 19:04.456
[Pen scribbles]

19:04.524 --> 19:07.059
Will you stay for some tea?

19:07.127 --> 19:09.962
I'd be honored.

19:20.206 --> 19:23.308
9:00 p.m.
to the second.

19:23.376 --> 19:26.678
Punctuality is
the best aphrodisiac.

19:26.746 --> 19:29.948
Who are you?

19:30.016 --> 19:33.585
I'm Batman.

19:33.653 --> 19:35.054
Did you bring
the accoutrement?

19:35.121 --> 19:36.688
<i>Oui.</i>

19:36.756 --> 19:38.891
I'm on pins and needles.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.492
[Giggles]
Uh-uh.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.062
Before we begin,
I need to know...

19:43.129 --> 19:44.863
Who's your front-runner?

19:44.931 --> 19:46.899
Maria Monroe.
Wasn't even close.

19:46.966 --> 19:49.535
I know.
There were no five best.

19:49.602 --> 19:51.403
- You were testing me?
- Mm-hmm.

19:51.471 --> 19:52.938
I wasn't about to serve up
my best candidate

19:53.006 --> 19:54.239
on a silver platter.

19:54.307 --> 19:56.175
God, I love that.

19:56.242 --> 19:58.377
After all,
Maria is very desirable.

19:58.445 --> 20:00.946
But the thing is,
I'm gonna need you...

20:01.014 --> 20:02.481
to help me close her.

20:02.549 --> 20:05.417
Louis, come closer.

20:08.088 --> 20:10.355
Stop.

20:10.423 --> 20:14.193
I'm gonna close the shit
out of Maria for you.

20:14.260 --> 20:17.329
And you're gonna close
the shit out of me.

20:17.397 --> 20:22.201
All aboard.

20:22.268 --> 20:24.169
Wait a minute,
if I didn't pick her,

20:24.237 --> 20:26.205
we wouldn't be doing this?

20:26.272 --> 20:27.406
Oh, I'm saying
no such thing.

20:27.474 --> 20:30.075
But the nature
of what we're about to do

20:30.143 --> 20:31.410
would be
radically different.

20:31.478 --> 20:35.380
I dominated,
so I get to dominate.

20:35.448 --> 20:37.549
- You get to <i>be</i> dominated.
- Yes, I do.

20:37.617 --> 20:39.985
Do you need
a safe word?

20:40.053 --> 20:42.020
Safe words are for pussies.

20:42.088 --> 20:43.088
Start with my slippers.

20:43.156 --> 20:44.756
Oh, thank you.

20:44.824 --> 20:48.694
[Gasps]

20:48.761 --> 20:51.597
[Knocks on door]

20:57.303 --> 20:59.471
- Hello.
- Where are your flowers?

20:59.539 --> 21:00.973
My flowers?

21:01.040 --> 21:03.475
You go on a date, you're
supposed to bring flowers.

21:03.543 --> 21:06.778
- Am I?
- Yes, Harvey.

21:06.846 --> 21:08.413
Everyone knows that.

21:08.481 --> 21:10.516
How many dates
have you been on?

21:10.583 --> 21:12.651
- Six.
- Six?

21:12.719 --> 21:15.454
Mm, sounds serious.
Who's the lucky guy?

21:15.522 --> 21:17.389
Jason.

21:17.457 --> 21:19.491
He's not a guy,
he's a boy.

21:19.559 --> 21:20.826
And he brings flowers.

21:20.894 --> 21:22.227
[Laughs]

21:22.295 --> 21:24.730
Well, maybe next time
we can have a double date.

21:24.797 --> 21:26.131
You that sure
it's gonna go well tonight?

21:26.199 --> 21:28.300
Olivia,
why don't you go upstairs

21:28.368 --> 21:30.068
and finish watching
your show?

21:30.136 --> 21:31.977
Is there maybe something
you forgot to tell me?

21:32.005 --> 21:33.605
You mean
about your daughter?

21:33.673 --> 21:36.074
See, that's funny
because we never slept together.

21:36.142 --> 21:37.609
I don't find it funny
in the least,

21:37.677 --> 21:39.645
and by "it," I mean
that we never slept together.

21:39.712 --> 21:43.348
Seriously, Harvey,
I'm really sorry about this.

21:43.416 --> 21:45.984
Olivia's my niece.
My brother just dropped her off.

21:46.052 --> 21:47.133
He didn't have
anybody else.

21:47.187 --> 21:48.954
Then I guess
we'll have to sit down,

21:49.022 --> 21:50.789
watch Bugs Bunny,
and order a pizza.

21:50.857 --> 21:54.059
[Laughs]
Bugs Bunny?

21:54.127 --> 21:56.161
Yeah, no one
watches that anymore.

21:56.229 --> 21:58.390
I thought <i>Apocalypse Now</i>
would be a little much for her.

21:58.431 --> 22:02.568
Can I come in?

22:02.635 --> 22:05.604
Hey.
Thanks for starting without me.

22:05.672 --> 22:08.307
- Couldn't wait.
- That bad a day?

22:08.374 --> 22:11.476
Mm, nope,
that good of one.

22:11.544 --> 22:12.945
So your little chat
with Rachel went well.

22:13.012 --> 22:15.514
Not what I meant.

22:15.582 --> 22:17.649
I negotiated a settlement
with the sister

22:17.717 --> 22:19.985
of the man who was killed
in a car accident today.

22:20.053 --> 22:21.787
Oh, my God.

22:21.854 --> 22:23.188
No, no.
It's not what you think.

22:23.256 --> 22:24.523
I, um,

22:24.591 --> 22:26.592
I gave this family dignity.

22:26.659 --> 22:31.029
And as hard as it was...

22:31.097 --> 22:34.499
It was the best day of work
I've ever had.

22:34.567 --> 22:36.368
That's awesome.

22:36.436 --> 22:40.739
Yeah.
[Cell phone vibrates]

22:40.807 --> 22:42.040
Hey.

22:42.108 --> 22:44.042
Liam's plea deal
came through.

22:44.110 --> 22:45.510
It's on its way
to Gillian's.

22:45.578 --> 22:47.618
I need you to go over there
and walk 'em through it,

22:47.680 --> 22:48.647
so we can wrap this up.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.482
Uh, I'm on my way.

22:50.550 --> 22:52.284
Sh.
What?

22:52.352 --> 22:54.219
I have to go see a client.

22:54.287 --> 22:56.555
Mike, you're high.

22:56.623 --> 22:59.658
What if they can tell?

22:59.726 --> 23:01.693
Tess, I was high every day
of my life for years,

23:01.761 --> 23:03.028
and nobody knew, okay?

23:03.096 --> 23:06.331
[Hands clap]
I can handle it.

23:06.399 --> 23:08.433
- She asleep?
- Not exactly.

23:08.501 --> 23:10.502
She wants you to go up there
and kiss her good night.

23:10.570 --> 23:11.670
[Laughs]

23:11.738 --> 23:13.772
You don't have to do this.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.174
- No, I can do that.
- Harvey.

23:16.242 --> 23:17.803
Afterwards, I want you
to come down here

23:17.844 --> 23:20.646
and kiss me good night.

23:27.287 --> 23:30.022
So...

23:30.089 --> 23:34.593
I sign this,
and we're done?

23:34.661 --> 23:37.029
Um...yeah.

23:37.096 --> 23:38.997
Uh, the A.D.A. agreed to it,

23:39.065 --> 23:42.301
so you sign it,
and then, um...

23:42.368 --> 23:44.469
and then the judge will sign it.

23:44.537 --> 23:48.140
[Voice breaks] And then--
then we're done.

23:48.207 --> 23:49.641

23:52.945 --> 23:54.646
[Sighs]

23:54.714 --> 23:58.150
Community service
and a fine.

23:58.217 --> 24:00.052
You sound disappointed.

24:00.119 --> 24:02.888
No, no,
I appreciate it.

24:02.955 --> 24:05.357
It's just...

24:05.425 --> 24:07.125
It could have been
so much worse.

24:07.193 --> 24:09.127
I thought
my life was over.

24:09.195 --> 24:11.530
I'm such an asshole.

24:11.597 --> 24:14.933
Hey, Liam,
it's okay to feel relief.

24:15.001 --> 24:16.802
The Chung family
doesn't blame you.

24:16.869 --> 24:19.871
Nobody blames you.

24:19.939 --> 24:21.239
Do you remember
what you said the other day

24:21.307 --> 24:24.609
about getting high?

24:24.677 --> 24:28.847
[Laughs]
Um, why are you asking me that?

24:28.915 --> 24:32.384
I was high.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.782
What?

24:37.223 --> 24:39.291
[Sighs]

24:39.359 --> 24:41.827
How could you
not tell us that?

24:41.894 --> 24:43.562
'Cause Harvey
said not to.

24:43.629 --> 24:44.563
But you said
you weren't drunk.

24:44.630 --> 24:45.764
You said, "ask everyone."

24:45.832 --> 24:46.765
You could have.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.467
I was alone.

24:48.534 --> 24:50.769
I get high all the time,
and no one ever knows.

24:50.837 --> 24:54.406
- Oh, my God.
- What's the matter?

24:54.474 --> 24:56.775
You said
this was a done deal.

24:56.843 --> 24:59.244
It is, right?

24:59.312 --> 25:02.814
Yeah.

25:02.882 --> 25:05.984
Yeah, it's a done deal.

25:16.695 --> 25:18.719
- We got a huge problem.
- Don't worry, Mike.

25:18.720 --> 25:22.223
I'm sure 'Nsync
will tour again someday.

25:22.290 --> 25:24.659
We can't submit this deal
because it wasn't an accident.

25:24.726 --> 25:25.926
It was a DUI.

25:25.994 --> 25:27.361
- What?
- He was stoned.

25:27.429 --> 25:30.364
This changes everything.
It changes nothing.

25:30.432 --> 25:31.912
I misrepresented the facts
to Katrina.

25:31.933 --> 25:33.234
No, you didn't,

25:33.301 --> 25:34.669
because you didn't know
because we didn't ask.

25:34.736 --> 25:37.638
And I didn't ask now,
but he told me now.

25:37.706 --> 25:39.426
And that's privileged,
and the deal is done.

25:39.474 --> 25:40.941
Wait a minute,
so you're not gonna do anything?

25:41.009 --> 25:43.377
I'm gonna have Donna messenger
this to the D.A.'s office.

25:43.445 --> 25:45.780
Harvey, this family thinks
their son is to blame.

25:45.847 --> 25:47.682
Because he was fleeing
the scene of a crime,

25:47.749 --> 25:49.817
which put him in harm's way.
Okay, maybe.

25:49.885 --> 25:51.246
But if I don't tell them
this part,

25:51.286 --> 25:52.987
then I'm no different
than Nick Rinaldi.

25:53.055 --> 25:54.355
- You're already different.
- What do you mean?

25:54.423 --> 25:56.490
I mean, they were ready
to take the $20,000,

25:56.558 --> 25:57.925
but you gave 'em $100,000.

25:57.993 --> 25:59.160
Did you think I wasn't going
to find out about that?

25:59.227 --> 26:00.728
Harvey, please, come on.

26:00.796 --> 26:02.296
You asked me
to be on this case

26:02.364 --> 26:04.498
after I warned you
about something like this.

26:04.566 --> 26:06.100
You said, "I'm onboard."

26:06.168 --> 26:07.702
Do you have any idea
what would happen

26:07.769 --> 26:08.803
if Gillian found out
what you did?

26:08.870 --> 26:10.738
What if she found out
about her son?

26:10.806 --> 26:12.206
She'd probably give them
a bigger settlement.

26:12.274 --> 26:14.975
But, hey, you already did that,
and I let it go.

26:15.043 --> 26:17.378
You need to let this go.
Say whatever you want.

26:17.446 --> 26:18.579
That's no different
than Nick Rinaldi,

26:18.647 --> 26:22.416
that's just more money
and cleaner shoes.

26:28.657 --> 26:29.857
Oh, my God.
You were waiting.

26:29.925 --> 26:31.425
I heard you were here,
so I rushed right out.

26:31.493 --> 26:33.427
I formally accept
your offer

26:33.495 --> 26:35.463
of employment
at Pearson Hardman.

26:35.530 --> 26:37.364
Oh, this is
the best week ever.

26:37.432 --> 26:38.799
I won't let you down.

26:38.867 --> 26:40.134
I'm sorry.

26:40.202 --> 26:41.936
I have no idea
what this is regarding,

26:42.003 --> 26:44.405
but, yes, he will.
He always does.

26:44.473 --> 26:46.540
- Water off a snail's back.
- See what I mean?

26:46.608 --> 26:49.510
Donna Paulsen, Maria Monroe,
my personal first-year.

26:49.578 --> 26:51.612
- Oh.
- She's a machine.

26:51.680 --> 26:52.847
And let me
just tell you something,

26:52.914 --> 26:54.248
she's gonna run circles
around Mike Ross.

26:54.316 --> 26:56.250
You wait right here,
and I'll get us some bundt cake.

26:56.318 --> 26:58.385
I'm sorry, Mike who?

26:58.453 --> 27:00.254
- Mike Ross.
- Is he a first-year?

27:00.322 --> 27:01.555
Why do you ask?

27:01.623 --> 27:03.190
I thought you only hired
from Harvard.

27:03.258 --> 27:05.760
- We do.
- I was secretary of my class.

27:05.827 --> 27:07.161
I knew every name.

27:07.229 --> 27:09.463
There was no Mike Ross
my year at Harvard.

27:09.531 --> 27:11.632
But you weren't
the same year.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.968
No, I clerked
for a year.

27:14.035 --> 27:15.156
He's a year
ahead of me here,

27:15.170 --> 27:16.370
but he would have been
in my class.

27:16.438 --> 27:18.672
Oh, well, Mike clerked
for three years,

27:18.740 --> 27:20.407
which means
he wasn't in your class.

27:20.475 --> 27:23.677
Well, I look forward
to meeting him.

27:30.552 --> 27:33.554
Uh...last night.

27:33.622 --> 27:35.556
I was, uh...

27:35.624 --> 27:36.891
I was driving home,

27:36.958 --> 27:39.426
I'd had a lot to drink.

27:39.494 --> 27:42.163
I hit someone.

27:42.230 --> 27:44.932
And I'm pretty sure
that they're dead.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.504
So, uh,
I need your help.

27:50.572 --> 27:52.640
Sorry,
I don't take cases like that.

27:52.707 --> 27:54.275
You don't take cases
like that?

27:54.342 --> 27:56.944
What about your case
from 1992?

27:57.012 --> 27:58.312
Driver plows into a car,

27:58.380 --> 28:00.314
after drinking
about a thousand jack and cokes,

28:00.382 --> 28:01.782
killing
a happily married couple?

28:01.850 --> 28:03.851
James and Nina Ross?

28:03.919 --> 28:05.559
I'm afraid
I have no recollection of that.

28:05.620 --> 28:07.755
Oh, yeah? Let me ring
a bell for you, then.

28:07.823 --> 28:09.523
Two days later, you walk
into their living room,

28:09.591 --> 28:11.492
you find their little boy
and his grandmother

28:11.560 --> 28:15.529
just sitting there,
and then you stick it to them.

28:15.597 --> 28:18.499
They hadn't even had time
to hold a wake yet.

28:18.567 --> 28:19.934
Are you still
gonna deny it?

28:20.001 --> 28:21.368
I didn't deny it,

28:21.436 --> 28:22.636
just have
no recollection of it

28:22.704 --> 28:25.005
because I did it
so many times.

28:25.073 --> 28:27.274
I'm sorry, is that
supposed to move me, huh?

28:27.342 --> 28:28.642
Am I supposed to think

28:28.710 --> 28:30.511
that you're somehow
above all that now?

28:30.579 --> 28:32.546
It's not supposed
to do anything.

28:32.614 --> 28:33.714
But let me point out,

28:33.782 --> 28:35.143
you walked in here
two minutes ago,

28:35.150 --> 28:39.186
told me you'd hit somebody,
and I turned you away.

28:39.254 --> 28:41.689
[Sighs]

28:42.256 --> 28:45.092
- What's your name?
- Like you give a shit.

28:45.159 --> 28:47.594
Okay.

28:47.662 --> 28:49.930
What are you looking for
from me?

28:49.997 --> 28:52.099
I want to know
how you live with yourself.

28:52.166 --> 28:54.000
I want to know
how you wake up every morning

28:54.068 --> 28:55.302
and not put a bullet
in your brain,

28:55.370 --> 28:57.537
knowing what a piece of shit
you are!

28:57.605 --> 28:59.973
You might not want
to hear this.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.575
But just because I
don't remember who you are

29:01.642 --> 29:03.944
doesn't mean I don't regret
what I did to you.

29:04.011 --> 29:05.645
Now the sad fact is
that once a deal is done,

29:05.713 --> 29:06.713
it can't be undone.

29:06.781 --> 29:11.551
James and Nina Ross.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.353
If I ever see you again,

29:13.421 --> 29:16.189
you better remember
who they are.

29:21.095 --> 29:23.463
Thank you.

29:23.531 --> 29:26.266
Did you know Louis
is hiring his own associate?

29:26.334 --> 29:28.335
Not specifically,
but he is entitled to it.

29:28.403 --> 29:29.636
We got to stop him.

29:29.704 --> 29:31.738
Harvey,
I know you're mad at Louis.

29:31.806 --> 29:33.173
So am I,
but it's over.

29:33.241 --> 29:35.242
We won, and the man
has a job to do.

29:35.309 --> 29:39.546
That's not
what I meant.

29:39.614 --> 29:41.948
We let him hire the person
he just hired,

29:42.016 --> 29:44.050
Mike's gonna be exposed.

29:44.118 --> 29:45.352
How do you know this?

29:45.420 --> 29:47.220
She was secretary
of his class.

29:47.288 --> 29:48.488
And there's 600 kids
in that class.

29:48.556 --> 29:51.425
Nobody knows everybody.
She says she does.

29:51.492 --> 29:53.994
- How can you be so sure?
- Donna met her.

29:54.061 --> 29:55.095
She's sure.

29:55.163 --> 29:57.063
Goddamn Mike Ross.

29:57.131 --> 30:01.134
He's the gift
that keeps on giving.

30:01.202 --> 30:06.139
How many more headaches is
this kid gonna cause me, Harvey?

30:09.644 --> 30:11.011
You wanted
to see me?

30:11.078 --> 30:14.147
Did you make an offer
to a Maria Monroe

30:14.215 --> 30:15.449
to be
a first-year associate?

30:15.516 --> 30:16.583
Yes, and let me
just tell you something,

30:16.651 --> 30:18.652
you're gonna love her.
Rescind it.

30:18.719 --> 30:20.687
- What?
- Firm's been through a lot.

30:20.755 --> 30:22.022
We have to regroup.

30:22.089 --> 30:24.291
Therefore, I'm instituting
a hiring freeze,

30:24.358 --> 30:25.598
which you
would have known about

30:25.626 --> 30:27.093
had you come
and asked my permission first.

30:27.161 --> 30:28.528
Okay, you can't do this.

30:28.596 --> 30:29.863
I'm a senior partner,
and that's the rule.

30:29.931 --> 30:31.298
Strictly speaking,
it's not a rule,

30:31.365 --> 30:32.566
it's a tradition.

30:32.633 --> 30:33.967
I get it.

30:34.035 --> 30:36.236
Strictly speaking, this
isn't about a hiring freeze,

30:36.304 --> 30:37.437
this is punishment.

30:37.505 --> 30:40.907
You can be punitive,
I can be punitive.

30:40.975 --> 30:42.375
The offer already went out,
Jessica.

30:42.443 --> 30:44.311
You're a lawyer,
make it go away.

30:44.378 --> 30:45.578
What am I gonna tell
the world?

30:45.613 --> 30:47.013
I'm gonna look
like a freaking fool.

30:47.048 --> 30:50.217
Well, tell them
there's a hiring freeze.

30:50.284 --> 30:52.018
I don't care.

30:52.086 --> 30:55.255
Make it go away.

30:57.124 --> 31:00.293
You're dismissed.

31:05.166 --> 31:07.334
The message you left
was a little cryptic.

31:07.401 --> 31:09.302
What do you want?

31:09.370 --> 31:11.538
I want to help you get
what you want.

31:11.606 --> 31:13.773
And what is that?

31:13.841 --> 31:15.308
Liam Colson was driving
under the influence

31:15.376 --> 31:17.878
when he hit Albert Chung.

31:17.945 --> 31:19.513
How exactly did you come
to know that?

31:19.580 --> 31:22.315
I can't tell you that.

31:22.383 --> 31:24.351
- Thank you, Mike.
- Yeah.

31:24.418 --> 31:25.585
All rise

31:25.653 --> 31:29.589
for the honorable judge
Nicholas Palermo.

31:29.657 --> 31:30.857
Be seated.

31:30.925 --> 31:36.563
"State of New York
versus Liam Colson."

31:36.631 --> 31:38.098
I am happy to report

31:38.165 --> 31:39.366
the state entered
into a plea agreement

31:39.433 --> 31:40.600
with the defendant
last night.

31:40.668 --> 31:45.472
You have a copy
of the terms, Your Honor.

31:45.540 --> 31:47.340
Everything appears
to be in order.

31:47.408 --> 31:48.708
The agreement
is approved.

31:48.776 --> 31:53.046
Community service
starts Monday.

31:53.114 --> 31:54.714
That's it?
You're just walking away?

31:54.782 --> 31:56.283
As fast as I can.

31:56.350 --> 31:59.352
Because you know what "I can't
tell you how I know that" means?

31:59.420 --> 32:00.453
It means
you just violated privilege.

32:00.521 --> 32:01.721
Wait, so you don't care

32:01.789 --> 32:03.557
that he was driving
under the influence?

32:03.624 --> 32:04.891
I can't prove
he was under the influence.

32:04.959 --> 32:06.192
You don't know
what you could prove

32:06.260 --> 32:07.661
if you got that kid
in a room.

32:07.728 --> 32:09.129
If I were to use
what you just told me,

32:09.196 --> 32:10.997
all I would be doing is making
myself look like an idiot.

32:11.065 --> 32:14.234
Are you really gonna be able
to sleep at night?

32:14.302 --> 32:15.802
Are you?

32:15.870 --> 32:17.671
You're the one
who walked in there

32:17.738 --> 32:20.240
and tried
to sell out a 20-year-old kid.

32:20.308 --> 32:22.242
He took someone's life,
right?

32:22.310 --> 32:24.945
That someone had a mother
and a father and a sister.

32:25.012 --> 32:27.047
That family
is never gonna be the same.

32:27.114 --> 32:29.783
Listen to me,
you think I haven't had a case

32:29.850 --> 32:31.885
where I could have crossed
a line to put someone away?

32:31.953 --> 32:33.920
[Laughs] I wouldn't
be surprised if you did,

32:33.988 --> 32:35.288
after that bribe
you offered me.

32:35.356 --> 32:37.958
I didn't offer you shit.

32:38.025 --> 32:39.492
I did you a favor.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.395
And then I asked for a favor,
which you could do or not.

32:42.463 --> 32:43.563
Is that really
what you tell yourself

32:43.631 --> 32:44.864
when you look
in the mirror?

32:44.932 --> 32:47.200
If you're willing
to break privilege,

32:47.268 --> 32:50.837
you're the one who needs
to look in the mirror.

33:04.251 --> 33:05.919
Katrina Bennett called.

33:05.987 --> 33:07.921
The deal's done.

33:07.989 --> 33:12.158
Get the paperwork started.

33:12.226 --> 33:14.294
Harvey,
what did you do?

33:14.362 --> 33:18.832
I did
what I had to do.

33:18.899 --> 33:20.900
Your first hire
was Mike.

33:20.968 --> 33:22.936
Are you sure you want this
to be your second?

33:23.004 --> 33:24.638
I don't want
to hear it.

33:24.705 --> 33:28.541
She starts on Monday.

33:45.321 --> 33:47.413
Chateauneuf-du-pape,
1985.

33:47.415 --> 33:50.017
I guess they were out
of the '83.

33:51.084 --> 33:52.819
Louis,

33:52.886 --> 33:55.254
you look like I just kicked you
in the stomach

33:55.322 --> 33:57.123
but in a bad way.
I'm sorry.

33:57.191 --> 33:59.992
I, uh...
my mind's on something else.

34:00.060 --> 34:02.995
What is it?

34:03.063 --> 34:05.097
Promise
you won't be mad?

34:05.165 --> 34:08.400
You're not about to tell me
I have to get tested, are you?

34:08.469 --> 34:10.536
What? No.
Nothing like that.

34:10.603 --> 34:11.904
I...

34:11.972 --> 34:13.906
I had to rescind the offer...

34:13.974 --> 34:17.009
to Maria.

34:17.077 --> 34:18.744
You're mad?
No.

34:18.812 --> 34:21.914
I'm disappointed.
Sheila...

34:21.982 --> 34:23.983
You're not the man
I thought you were.

34:24.051 --> 34:26.185
I--I didn't have
a choice.

34:26.253 --> 34:27.719
It was
Jessica Pearson's decision.

34:27.788 --> 34:28.855
Okay, well,
then I must have read you wrong

34:28.922 --> 34:29.956
'cause I thought you were

34:30.023 --> 34:31.190
a strong, powerful
senior partner.

34:31.257 --> 34:32.592
I am.

34:32.659 --> 34:35.561
The evidence suggests
otherwise.

34:35.629 --> 34:39.599
I think you should go.

34:39.666 --> 34:41.400
Sheila, please.

34:41.467 --> 34:44.837
I mean, can't this snafu
just be something we laugh at,

34:44.905 --> 34:46.272
like, in an hour and a half,
hour and 45 minutes?

34:46.340 --> 34:48.608
Your sexual prowess
isn't gonna get you out of this.

34:48.675 --> 34:50.109
- You are mad.
- Yeah.

34:50.177 --> 34:52.245
I put my reputation on the line
to close Maria.

34:52.312 --> 34:53.446
Look, it's not my fault.

34:53.514 --> 34:55.614
The firm instituted
a hiring freeze.

34:55.681 --> 34:56.681
If there's
a hiring freeze going on,

34:56.750 --> 34:58.217
then why do I know
for a fact

34:58.285 --> 35:02.421
that Harvey Specter hired
a fifth-year associate today?

35:02.489 --> 35:04.056
You offered Katrina Bennett
a job?

35:04.124 --> 35:05.324
I looked into her.

35:05.392 --> 35:06.392
Turns out
she's a stellar candidate.

35:06.460 --> 35:09.228
[Scoffs]
You bribed her.

35:09.296 --> 35:11.430
A bribe requires
a clear exchange

35:11.498 --> 35:12.932
of something
for something else.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.600
That didn't happen here.
Bullshit.

35:14.668 --> 35:15.601
She said she'd put
the deal through

35:15.669 --> 35:17.370
if you offered her a job.

35:17.437 --> 35:18.371
She said she'd put
the deal through,

35:18.438 --> 35:19.772
<i>then</i> I offered her a job.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.207
Oh, right, because you needed
an insurance policy.

35:21.275 --> 35:24.510
Because I could see exactly
what you were gonna do.

35:24.578 --> 35:26.946
So you offered her a job to
get her to do what you wanted.

35:27.014 --> 35:28.414
That's something
for something else.

35:28.415 --> 35:30.016
You bribed her.

35:30.083 --> 35:31.551
You bet your ass I did.

35:31.618 --> 35:33.519
But what you're too stupid
to understand is

35:33.587 --> 35:35.187
I did it to save you.

35:35.255 --> 35:37.490
Get it
through your goddamn head.

35:37.558 --> 35:39.125
You're not like
other lawyers.

35:39.192 --> 35:40.793
You break
attorney-client privilege,

35:40.861 --> 35:42.528
nothing different happens
with Liam,

35:42.596 --> 35:44.797
but they're sure as shit
gonna look into you.

35:44.865 --> 35:46.265
And you and I both know what
they're gonna find when they do.

35:46.333 --> 35:48.053
What difference does it make
what they find?

35:48.068 --> 35:49.302
There's such a thing
as right and wrong.

35:49.369 --> 35:50.436
And we're wrong!

35:50.504 --> 35:51.771
You know what?

35:51.838 --> 35:53.306
I have had it up to here
with you blaming me

35:53.373 --> 35:55.441
for every hard choice
that comes with this job.

35:55.509 --> 35:59.445
- Harvey, come on.
- Shut up!

35:59.513 --> 36:03.215
Is your life better or worse
than before I hired you?

36:03.283 --> 36:04.483
It's both.

36:04.551 --> 36:06.385
Well, maybe you should focus
on the better,

36:06.453 --> 36:07.853
because the next time
I have the option

36:07.921 --> 36:09.755
to cross a line
to save you,

36:09.823 --> 36:13.025
I'll send you packing
and not think twice.

36:13.093 --> 36:17.663
Now get your shit together.

36:57.471 --> 37:00.506
[Elevator bell dings]

37:15.422 --> 37:16.589
Is it done?

37:16.657 --> 37:18.691
It's done.

37:18.759 --> 37:21.494
Thank you.
What's wrong?

37:21.561 --> 37:24.697
What's wrong?
A man is dead.

37:24.765 --> 37:26.565
You killed him,
and I have to live with it.

37:26.633 --> 37:29.502
And you think
I don't know that?

37:29.569 --> 37:32.004
I get to go back to my life
like nothing happened,

37:32.072 --> 37:34.306
but something did happen.

37:34.374 --> 37:36.542
It makes me sick.
It should.

37:36.610 --> 37:39.145
Is that why you came here,
to make me feel worse?

37:39.212 --> 37:41.881
You've been given a gift
that you don't deserve.

37:41.948 --> 37:43.582
So you better
clean yourself up

37:43.650 --> 37:48.120
and figure out a way
to make up for Albert Chung.

37:48.188 --> 37:50.589
[Knock at door]

37:53.827 --> 37:55.795
You brought flowers.
You're learning.

37:55.862 --> 37:58.297
They're for Olivia.

37:58.365 --> 38:01.133
What about me?

38:01.201 --> 38:02.334
That's for you.

38:02.402 --> 38:04.470
You bought me a...car?

38:04.538 --> 38:06.505
Yeah, I was thinking
we'd drive up to the Berkshires.

38:06.573 --> 38:08.774
There's a little cabin
I know.

38:08.842 --> 38:10.309
It's got its own sauna,

38:10.377 --> 38:13.846
private chef.

38:13.914 --> 38:15.114
Oh, wow.

38:15.182 --> 38:18.617
I can't go away
with you, Harvey.

38:18.685 --> 38:20.193
Why not?

38:24.257 --> 38:26.358
My brother's
got cancer.

38:26.426 --> 38:29.361
He's--
he's not gonna make it.

38:29.429 --> 38:32.498
Oh, my God.

38:32.566 --> 38:33.899
Her dad.

38:33.967 --> 38:35.334
I mean, we knew
that it was coming.

38:35.402 --> 38:38.504
We just didn't know
it would be this fast.

38:41.508 --> 38:43.776
- Is she here?
- No.

38:43.844 --> 38:45.711
But I'm going
to my parents',

38:45.779 --> 38:48.481
and I'm gonna--
I'm gonna take her with me.

38:48.548 --> 38:51.517
I'm gonna raise her.

38:51.585 --> 38:53.552
Why didn't you tell me?

38:53.620 --> 38:55.721
Because I thought,
you know, when...

38:55.789 --> 38:57.150
[Sniffles]
you saw Olivia was here,

38:57.157 --> 38:59.258
that we'd reschedule
or something, you know?

38:59.326 --> 39:01.127
And then...

39:01.194 --> 39:04.063
I saw you with her,
and it...

39:04.131 --> 39:06.432
It was...

39:06.500 --> 39:09.135
You wanted
to have a night.

39:09.202 --> 39:12.104
Okay, I didn't think
it would lead to that.

39:15.275 --> 39:19.078
But I'm really happy
that it did.

39:19.146 --> 39:21.514
When are you going?

39:21.581 --> 39:24.483
Soon.

39:27.854 --> 39:32.124
I'm sorry.

39:32.192 --> 39:36.428
I'm so, so sorry.

39:38.465 --> 39:41.867
Surprise.

39:41.935 --> 39:44.303
Hey, I never heard from you.
How did the case go?

39:44.371 --> 39:45.938
I don't want
to talk about it.

39:46.006 --> 39:48.440
That bad, huh?

39:48.508 --> 39:50.476
Yeah, that bad.

39:50.544 --> 39:52.912
Well, why don't you
come over here,

39:52.979 --> 39:54.513
and I'll make you
feel better?

39:54.581 --> 39:57.316
I already started
without you.

40:01.021 --> 40:03.556
I can't do this anymore,
Tess.

40:03.623 --> 40:05.391
Get high?

40:05.458 --> 40:08.260
- It's so disgusting.
- What got into you?

40:08.328 --> 40:12.131
This whole thing
is disgusting.

40:15.202 --> 40:17.803
Are you breaking up
with me?

40:22.275 --> 40:24.910
- Do you love your husband?
- What?

40:24.978 --> 40:25.945
It's a simple question, Tess,
answer it.

40:26.012 --> 40:29.782
Do you love your husband?

40:29.850 --> 40:33.352
- Uh, I don't know.
- See, I don't even know that.

40:33.420 --> 40:34.653
Because we never even talk
about it.

40:34.721 --> 40:35.788
Well, we can talk
about it now.

40:35.856 --> 40:37.256
I don't want
to talk about it now!

40:37.324 --> 40:40.759
Tess, there is such a thing
as right and wrong.

40:40.827 --> 40:42.995
And what we're doing here...

40:43.063 --> 40:45.431
It's just wrong, and...

40:45.498 --> 40:47.800
you're married.

40:47.868 --> 40:53.038
And I don't want
a part of it anymore.

40:53.106 --> 40:58.344
What if I wasn't?

40:58.411 --> 41:01.013
Mike.

41:01.081 --> 41:03.582
You need to go.

41:03.650 --> 41:08.487
And I need
to get my shit together.
