HOME BOX OFFICE

00:05.800 --> 00:08.800
A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:13.667 --> 00:16.667
SO, I'M REALLY HAPPY
WITH MY NEW SNEAKERS.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.233
YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE THEY'RE GRAY.

00:19.267 --> 00:23.133
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IT'S A GOOD COLOR

00:23.167 --> 00:25.167
'CAUSE WHITE
IS REALLY TOO BRIGHT,

00:25.200 --> 00:29.467
AND BLACK IS ALMOST
LIKE A PAIR OF SHOES.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.467
AND GRAY IS KIND OF
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.000
THEY LOOK GOOD.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.500
I WISH YOU WOULD
GET BACK TO CHERYL.

00:36.533 --> 00:38.633
YOU KNOW, WE JUST DON'T
DO ENOUGH THINGS TOGETHER.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.267
SHE PLAYS TENNIS,
SHE WON'T PLAY GOLF.

00:40.300 --> 00:43.367
I CAN'T PLAY TENNIS
BECAUSE OF MY NECK.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.600
I CAN'T SERVE,

00:44.633 --> 00:46.833
I'LL HAVE TO MAKE
DAINTY LITTLE SERVES,

00:46.867 --> 00:48.400
AND SHE'LL BEAT ME
EVERY TIME.

00:48.433 --> 00:50.233
WHAT ELSE DOES
CHERYL LIKE TO DO ?

00:50.267 --> 00:52.900
SHE LIKES THE OUTDOORS.

00:52.933 --> 00:55.200
I DON'T REALLY LIKE
THE OUTDOORS, YOU KNOW.

00:55.233 --> 00:57.433
IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE
FOR BALD PEOPLE OUT THERE.

00:57.467 --> 00:59.200
WHAT ABOUT THE BEACH ?

00:59.233 --> 01:00.800
I DON'T LIKE
THE BEACH IN PARTICULAR.

01:00.833 --> 01:02.567
THE BEACH IS LOVELY
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.833
I GO UP TO SANTA BARBARA,
WE GO TO THE BEACH.

01:05.867 --> 01:07.267
VERY NICE,
IT'S NOT CROWDED.

01:07.300 --> 01:11.700
WELL, I MEAN, IF I WENT
TO THE BEACH WITH HER,

01:11.733 --> 01:13.100
SHE WOULD BE...

01:14.333 --> 01:17.333
SHE WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK, YEAH.

01:17.367 --> 01:18.333
SHE'D BE HAPPY.

01:18.367 --> 01:19.367
YEAH, SHE'D BE VERY HAPPY.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.500
GO TO THE BEACH
WITH HER.

01:20.533 --> 01:22.067
HATE IT.

01:22.067 --> 01:25.133
ALL THOSE DISGUSTING BODIES
WALKING AROUND,

01:25.167 --> 01:26.567
I HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.933
WELL, OUR TIME IS UP.

01:33.233 --> 01:35.600
MAYBE I'LL TAKE HER
TO THE BEACH.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.533
GOOD IDEA.
MAYBE I WILL.

01:46.933 --> 01:50.900
OKAY, SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK, BE WELL.

01:50.933 --> 01:52.567
HEY.

01:52.600 --> 01:53.567
HEY, HOW YOU DOING ?

01:53.600 --> 01:54.667
GOOD, HOW ARE YOU ?

01:54.700 --> 01:55.667
NICE TO SEE YOU.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.733
YOU CURED ?

01:56.767 --> 01:58.467
I'M 100%.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.700
YOU HAD THE BIG
BREAKTHROUGH ?

01:59.733 --> 02:00.933
I THINK I'M
READY TO TERMINATE.

02:00.967 --> 02:02.733
OKAY, YEAH GREAT.

02:02.767 --> 02:04.367
IT'S SUCH NONSENSE,
ISN'T IT ?

02:04.400 --> 02:05.467
I MEAN, WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO ?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.067
YOU CAN'T BOTHER
YOUR FRIENDS WITH THIS STUFF.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.367
THE LIST
GOES ON FOREVER.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.400
I KNOW.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.233
ROB, HAVE A SEAT,
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

02:11.267 --> 02:12.533
OKAY, ALRIGHT.

02:12.567 --> 02:16.067
YEAH, LISTEN,
I JUST WANT TO SAY,

02:16.067 --> 02:17.300
I'M DOING THIS
CHARITY THING.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.767
I'M THE CHAIRMAN
OF THIS,

02:19.800 --> 02:21.533
YOU KNOW WHAT
GROTE'S SYNDROME IS ?

02:21.567 --> 02:23.500
GROTE, HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD OF GROTE'S SYNDROME ?

02:23.533 --> 02:24.567
NO.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.700
IT'S A SYNDROME.
I MEAN,

02:26.733 --> 02:29.800
AND IT AFFECTS
KIDS AND ADULTS,

02:29.833 --> 02:33.867
WHO HAVE A TOUGH TIME
CONTROLLING THEIR HYPERACTIVITY.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.167
IT'S JUST LIKE, IF YOU
WERE ON FIVE CUPS OF COFFEE,

02:36.200 --> 02:37.467
AT ALL TIMES.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.967
AND SO, WE'RE DOING
A BIG CELEBRITY AUCTION.

02:40.067 --> 02:42.933
AND IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF YOU WOULD AGREE TO,

02:42.967 --> 02:45.433
ALLOW YOURSELF
TO BE AUCTIONED OFF

02:45.467 --> 02:46.800
AND HAVE LUNCH
WITH SOMEBODY.

02:46.833 --> 02:47.933
I MEAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE DOING IT.

02:47.967 --> 02:51.067
TONY DANZA,
AND TED DANSON.

02:51.067 --> 02:54.067
WELL, WAIT A SECOND,
ROB, FIRST OF ALL,

02:54.067 --> 02:57.100
I'M FLATTERED THAT YOU WOULD
EVEN THINK OF ME FOR THIS,

02:57.133 --> 02:59.733
BUT, ROB, NO ONE WANTS
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH ME.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.800
OH, NO, YOU ARE THE GUY
WHO CREATED "SEINFELD".

03:01.833 --> 03:02.933
YEAH, BUT...

03:02.967 --> 03:06.533
I MEAN, THE PEOPLE
LOVE TO BE SITTING--

03:06.567 --> 03:08.933
NO ONE'S GONNA BID ANY MONEY,
IT'S GONNA BE EMBARRASSING.

03:08.967 --> 03:10.800
TO GO TO
A LARRY DAVID LUNCH ?

03:10.833 --> 03:13.267
50 CENTS, YOU KNOW,
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.767
NO, YOU'LL BE SURPRISED
HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO GENERATE

03:15.800 --> 03:18.400
JUST BY YOU AGREEING
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH THEM.

03:18.433 --> 03:22.200
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE

03:22.233 --> 03:24.533
FOR ME TO BE
ENTERTAINING...

03:24.567 --> 03:27.200
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE ENTERTAINING,
JUST BE YOURSELF,

03:27.233 --> 03:28.867
AND THEY'LL JUST
BE THRILLED TO BE WITH YOU.

03:28.900 --> 03:29.867
IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO DO IT...

03:29.900 --> 03:30.900
NO, IT'S FINE,
I'LL DO IT.

03:30.933 --> 03:31.933
YOU WILL ?

03:31.967 --> 03:33.133
OH, GREAT.

03:33.167 --> 03:34.667
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED
AT HOW MUCH YOU GO FOR.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.833
SURPRISED, I'M GONNA BE,

03:36.867 --> 03:39.300
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
BE SURPRISED AT
HOW LITTLE I GO FOR.

03:39.333 --> 03:41.500
ANYWAY, THANKS, LARRY,
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

03:41.533 --> 03:42.700
THAT'S GREAT.

03:57.533 --> 03:58.767
HEY.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.567
I THINK THAT, UH,
SANTA BARBARA THING,

04:07.600 --> 04:10.867
I THINK THAT'S
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.233
I THINK
I'M GONNA DO IT.

04:16.333 --> 04:20.767
YOU KNOW, GO TO
SANTA BARBARA, ONE DAY.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.167
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING ON SATURDAY ?

04:30.200 --> 04:31.967
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
GOING TO THE BEACH ?

04:32.900 --> 04:34.467
SANTA BARBARA.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.900
THE TWO OF US ?

04:36.933 --> 04:37.900
ANY INTEREST IN THAT ?

04:37.933 --> 04:38.900
YEAH.

04:38.933 --> 04:39.900
REALLY ?

04:39.933 --> 04:41.333
I THINK THAT
WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

04:41.367 --> 04:42.367
DO YOU ?

04:42.400 --> 04:43.767
REALLY ?OF C.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.367
DON'T YOU THINK I WOULD
LOVE TO GO TO E BEACH ?

04:45.400 --> 04:47.133
DO YOU ?
YOU WANT TO ?

04:47.167 --> 04:48.567
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.167
WHAT ABOUT GOLF,
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING GOLF ?

04:51.200 --> 04:53.100
SO I DON'T HAVE TO PLAY,
I WON'T PLAY, BIG DEAL.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.200
SO I'LL MISS
A DAY OF GOLF.

04:54.233 --> 04:55.300
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY
EVERY SATURDAY.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.400
OH, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

04:56.433 --> 04:58.467
YOU CAN SPEND THE DAY
WITH YOUR WIFE.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.267
EXACTLY, THAT'S
WHAT I'M DOING.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.533
I WOULD LOVE TO ACCEPT
YOUR INVITATION.

05:02.567 --> 05:03.833
OKAY, YOU GOT A DATE.

05:03.867 --> 05:06.233
NOW, WHAT DO
I NEED TO BRING ?

05:06.267 --> 05:07.433
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU DON'T NEED TO...

05:07.467 --> 05:08.467
I NEED A BATHING SUIT,
RIGHT ?

05:08.500 --> 05:09.833
YOU NEED
A BATHING SUIT,

05:09.867 --> 05:12.067
BUT THAT'S ALL YOU NEED
TO WORRY YOURSELF WITH, OKAY ?

05:12.067 --> 05:13.833
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE REST.

05:13.867 --> 05:17.267
A RADIO, IS THERE A BALLGAME
I CAN LISTEN TO OR ANYTHING ?

05:17.300 --> 05:19.967
THEN YOU'RE DEFEATING
THE PURPOSE, AREN'T YOU ?

05:20.067 --> 05:23.433
SO WHAT DO YOU DO, YOU LIE DOWN
ON A BLANKET, AND... ?

05:23.467 --> 05:25.833
YOU BASK IN THE SUN.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.233
DON'T FORGET
SUNBLOCK.

05:27.267 --> 05:28.700
I WILL NOT
FORGET SUNBLOCK.

05:28.733 --> 05:30.567
35, 40...

05:30.600 --> 05:32.067
AS HIGH
AS I CAN GET.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.067
AS HIGH
AS YOU CAN GET.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.800
GOTCHA, I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.967
ALRIGHT.

05:47.067 --> 05:50.167
THAT WAS A NICE DRIVE,
I HAVE TO SAY.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.700
OH, YEAH,
LOOK AT THIS.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.567
IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE.

05:59.867 --> 06:03.300
ALRIGHT, LET'S SEE,
I'LL GRAB THIS.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.600
OH.

06:07.933 --> 06:11.067
SHOES IN HERE.

06:12.533 --> 06:13.733
I'LL GET THIS.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.133
WHAT, WHERE DO
I PUT THIS SUIT ON ?

06:15.167 --> 06:18.067
WHY DIDN'T YOU WEAR IT ?

06:18.067 --> 06:19.067
YOU GOT YOURS ON ?

06:19.067 --> 06:20.300
OF COURSE.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.267
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE UNCOMFORTABLE.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.067
YOU'RE GOING
TO THE BEACH.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.467
I DIDN'T WANT TO DRIVE
AN HOUR AND A HALF

06:25.500 --> 06:26.533
WITH A BATHING SUIT ON.

06:26.567 --> 06:28.600
ALRIGHT, WELL.

06:28.633 --> 06:30.067
WELL, I DON'T
HAVE TO PUT IT ON.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.067
I'M NOT GONNA GO
SWIMMING ANYWAY, AM I ?

06:32.067 --> 06:33.500
SO WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE ?

06:35.133 --> 06:37.367
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

06:43.967 --> 06:46.067
YOU WANT THIS
WATER COOLER ?

06:46.067 --> 06:47.567
YEAH.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.067
OKAY.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.267
I CAN'T CARRY
ALL THIS STUFF.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.833
WHAT ABOUT THE UMBRELLA,
YOU WANT THAT TOO ?

06:53.867 --> 06:55.567
YES, PLEASE.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.967
OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS GORGEOUS.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.400
GOT ANY SUNBLOCK ?

07:23.433 --> 07:24.533
YEAH.

07:33.067 --> 07:36.167
JEWS BUY, LIKE,
85% OF THE SUN BLOCK,

07:36.200 --> 07:37.767
THAT'S SOLD IN THIS COUNTRY,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.467
I'VE NEVER
THOUGHT ABOUT...

07:39.500 --> 07:40.967
WITHOUT JEWS,
THESE SUN BLOCK PEOPLE

07:41.067 --> 07:42.067
WOULD BE
OUT OF BUSINESS.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.100
IS THAT RIGHT ?

07:43.133 --> 07:46.533
YEAH, I'VE NEVER ONCE
SEEN A GENTILE ASK FOR,

07:46.567 --> 07:48.733
OR EVEN PUT ON
SUN BLOCK.

07:48.767 --> 07:49.700
TRUE.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.967
I DON'T REALLY GET
THIS FASCINATION

08:02.067 --> 08:03.567
THAT PEOPLE HAVE
WITH THE OCEAN.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.967
NO ?

08:05.067 --> 08:08.900
I STARE AT IT FOR 10 MINUTES
AND I GO, "OKAY, I GET IT".

08:08.933 --> 08:10.600
DON'T YOU
FEEL CALMER ?

08:10.633 --> 08:13.233
I FEEL AGGRAVATED
THAT I'M MISSING

08:13.267 --> 08:15.067
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
ARE GETTING.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.700
HOLY SHIT.

08:26.733 --> 08:27.700
WHAT ?

08:27.733 --> 08:28.933
I THINK I JUST
SAW MY THERAPIST.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.967
YOU SEE A GUY IN
A STRIPED BATHING SUIT ?

08:31.067 --> 08:32.633
SKIMPY, SKIMPY SUIT,
YOU SEE THAT ?

08:32.667 --> 08:34.633
YEAH, I SEE HIM.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.833
YEAH, THAT'S MY THERAPIST.

08:36.867 --> 08:38.567
WHY DON'T
YOU GO SAY HI ?

08:38.600 --> 08:41.700
I CAN'T TALK TO HIM
IN THAT BATHING SUIT.

08:41.733 --> 08:43.067
IT IS PRETTY SMALL.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.867
HOW CAN HE WALK AROUND
IN A BATHING SUIT LIKE THAT ?

08:44.900 --> 08:46.733
I MEAN,
HE'S AT THE BEACH,

08:46.767 --> 08:48.700
HE CAN WEAR WHATEVER
HE WANTS, RIGHT ?

08:48.733 --> 08:50.367
WHAT'S HE DOING ?

08:50.400 --> 08:54.333
HE'S JUST KIND
OF SETTLING IN.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.933
OOH...

08:55.967 --> 08:58.700
DID YOU SEE THE BACK
OF HIS BATHING SUIT ?

08:58.733 --> 09:00.633
HOW DOES HE WALK
AROUND LIKE THAT ?

09:00.667 --> 09:02.767
CAN WE GO ?
LET'S JUST GO.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.967
WE JUST GOT HERE,
WE'RE NOT GONNA GO.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.067
THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
PLUS, IF YOU GET UP,

09:08.067 --> 09:09.833
DON'T YOU THINK
HE'LL SEE YOU THEN ?

09:11.533 --> 09:13.167
I'VE GOT TO STAY
LIKE THIS NOW,

09:13.200 --> 09:14.867
FOR THE REST
OF THE DAY ?

09:14.900 --> 09:17.333
WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

09:17.367 --> 09:19.300
WELL, KISS THAT
THERAPIST GOODBYE.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.633
THE ONLY QUESTION NOW IS,
DO I TELL RICHARD LEWIS ?

09:26.300 --> 09:28.500
ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS DR. WEISS ?

09:28.533 --> 09:29.700
IT WAS HIM,
IT WAS HIM.

09:29.733 --> 09:33.400
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
IT WAS WEISS, DR. WEISS.

09:33.433 --> 09:35.833
THONG, UP HIS ASS.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.267
LIKE RICHARD SIMMONS ?

09:38.300 --> 09:40.567
RICHARD SIMMONS
HAS A THONG UP HIS ASS ?

09:40.600 --> 09:41.633
DID YOU EVER SEE HIM
DO THAT SHIT ?

09:41.667 --> 09:42.667
NO.

09:42.700 --> 09:43.967
HOLY SHIT.

09:44.067 --> 09:46.533
SO, YOU KNOW,
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU,

09:46.567 --> 09:48.933
YOU KNOW,
SO I'M LEAVING...

09:48.967 --> 09:51.200
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS IS SO UNFAIR OF YOU.

09:51.233 --> 09:53.600
I TURN YOU ON TO THIS GUY,
HE'S A BRILLIANT DOCTOR.

09:53.633 --> 09:55.133
I WOULD'VE
NEVER TOLD YOU.

09:55.167 --> 09:56.667
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.733
SAVING YOU FROM THIS HEDONIST
GIVING YOU ADVICE.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.167
HEDONIST,
HE'S A HEDONIST ?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.167
HE'S NOT A HEDONIST.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.167
WHAT IS HE ?

10:03.200 --> 10:06.300
THIS IS MY 28th THERAPIST
SINCE 1969.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.467
I DON'T WANT
TO GO ANYMORE,

10:07.500 --> 10:08.900
I DON'T WANT TO BREAK
THE FUCKING RECORD.

10:08.933 --> 10:09.933
THE RECAP IS VERY HARD.

10:09.967 --> 10:12.400
YOUR RECAP IS TWO,
THREE MONTHS, ISN'T IT ?

10:12.433 --> 10:14.933
TWO, THREE MONTHS,
THAT'S JUST THE CRIB.

10:14.967 --> 10:19.867
I WAS BORN IN BROOKLYN,
AND I FELT ALIENATED,

10:19.900 --> 10:21.867
AND I BECAME
AN ALCOHOLIC...

10:21.900 --> 10:25.367
OKAY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT NOW.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.067
HOW AM I GONNA TELL HIM
I'M GONNA LEAVE NOW ?

10:28.100 --> 10:30.000
HOW AM I GONNA TELL HIM
I'M GONNA LEAVE NOW ?

10:30.033 --> 10:32.100
I DON'T KNOW, CAN YOU
DO IT ON THE PHONE ?

10:32.133 --> 10:33.100
DO YOU HAVE TO
DO IT IN PERSON ?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.100
YOU'RE NOT
CANCELING CABLE.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.733
YOU HAVE TO GO IN,
HE'S A HUMAN BEING,

10:35.767 --> 10:37.067
HE'S HELPED YOU,
YOU GOT TO SAY...

10:37.100 --> 10:40.233
LET'S GO OUT TO LUNCH,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS,

10:40.267 --> 10:41.767
'CAUSE WE NEED
A GAME PLAN.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.500
THERE'S NO PLAN,
YOU GO IN AND QUIT.

10:43.533 --> 10:44.700
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ?

10:44.733 --> 10:47.033
CAN'T WE HAVE LUNCH
OR SOMETHING, AND DISCUSS THIS ?

10:47.067 --> 10:48.000
I CAN'T.

10:48.867 --> 10:50.300
WHY NOT ?

10:50.333 --> 10:52.867
I'VE BEEN AUCTIONED OFF
FOR SOME CHARITY.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.300
WHAT IS THIS, "ROOTS" ?

10:54.333 --> 10:55.300
WHAT YOU MEAN,
AUCTIONED OFF ?

10:55.333 --> 10:57.267
IT'S SOME
CELEBRITY AUCTION.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.467
SOMEBODY PAID $4,000
TO GO HAVE LUNCH WITH ME.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.067
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ?

11:01.067 --> 11:02.400
YOU SHOULD
BE FLATTERED.

11:02.433 --> 11:04.867
HE WANTS TO HAVE LUNCH
WITH LARRY DAVID.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.800
I FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO BE ENTERTAINING, YOU KNOW ?

11:08.833 --> 11:10.667
ALRIGHT, WELL,
ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.067
MR. DAVID !

11:19.067 --> 11:20.433
MR. DAVID,
OVER HERE.

11:20.467 --> 11:22.867
HIYA, JOHN TYLER.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.467
JOHN TYLER ?

11:24.500 --> 11:27.167
WOW, LIKE THE PRESIDENT,

11:27.200 --> 11:29.767
PRESIDENT TYLER.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.133
YEAH.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.600
SHOULD I CALL YOU
MR. PRESIDENT ?

11:32.633 --> 11:35.467
THIS IS GREAT, THANK YOU
FOR DONATING YOUR TIME

11:35.500 --> 11:36.933
FOR THE AUCTION
AND EVERYTHING.

11:36.967 --> 11:38.867
"TIP A CANOE
AND TYLER TOO."

11:38.900 --> 11:41.400
YOU KNOW WHAT
TIP A CANOE WAS ?

11:41.433 --> 11:43.100
NO.

11:43.133 --> 11:44.267
YOU DON'T KNOW,

11:44.300 --> 11:46.067
IF I WAS NAMED
AFTER A PRESIDENT,

11:46.067 --> 11:47.733
I WOULD KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT.

11:47.767 --> 11:50.400
I WASN'T NAMED AFTER HIM,
IT'S JUST A FAMILY NAME.

11:50.433 --> 11:53.933
YOU NEVER KNOW,
I'M RELATED TO KING DAVID.

11:53.967 --> 11:54.967
REALLY ?

11:55.067 --> 11:59.300
YES, SO,
A PRESIDENT

11:59.333 --> 12:00.667
AND A KING,

12:00.700 --> 12:04.167
AT THE SAME TABLE,
PRETTY BIG TABLE.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.333
IT'S A FAMILY NAME,
REALLY.

12:06.367 --> 12:07.433
BIG FAMILY ?

12:07.467 --> 12:10.200
YEAH, FIVE BROTHERS
AND SISTERS, YOU KNOW,

12:10.233 --> 12:11.333
IRISH.

12:11.367 --> 12:14.300
YOU EVER CATCH
YOUR PARENTS HAVING SEX ?

12:14.333 --> 12:16.200
NO.

12:16.233 --> 12:18.067
WELL, ME EITHER.

12:18.067 --> 12:19.400
YOU KNOW THEY DID,

12:19.433 --> 12:23.600
BUT, YOU WONDER WHEN.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.833
SO WHERE,
WHERE YOU FROM ?

12:25.867 --> 12:27.300
JERSEY, ORIGINALLY.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.333
YEAH ?

12:28.367 --> 12:30.700
YOU EVER SEE,
JOE PISCOPO'S "JERSEY GUY" ?

12:30.733 --> 12:32.067
"HEY, I'M JERSEY GUY.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.833
I'M FROM JERSEY,
I'M THE JERSEY GUY."

12:34.867 --> 12:38.300
YEAH, PEOPLE FROM JERSEY DIDN'T
REALLY FIND THAT GUY FUNNY.

12:41.267 --> 12:42.433
( glass chiming )

12:42.467 --> 12:45.067
EVER PLAY THE SALT
AND PEPPER SHAKERS ?

12:48.700 --> 12:51.367
WHAT SONG IS THIS ?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.567
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU."

12:58.600 --> 13:00.133
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY

13:00.167 --> 13:05.567
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
MR. PRESIDENT JOHN TYLER *

13:05.600 --> 13:08.100
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY

13:10.967 --> 13:15.133
ANYWAY, EVERYBODY
FROM GROTE'S SYNDROME
ASSOCIATION JUST...

13:15.167 --> 13:17.633
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME,

13:17.667 --> 13:18.700
AND FOR DONATING THE LUNCH
AND EVERYTHING,

13:18.733 --> 13:19.700
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.333
OH, PLEASE,
WHATEVER YOU NEED,

13:21.367 --> 13:22.333
I'LL DONATE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

13:22.367 --> 13:23.667
I'LL DONATE IT ALL.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.667
MY TIME, MY ORGANS.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.767
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
YOU WANT A KIDNEY ?

13:26.800 --> 13:27.800
I'LL GIVE YOU A KIDNEY.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.667
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED ?

13:29.700 --> 13:31.200
I'VE GOT
A TERRIFIC PENIS.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.367
I COULD DONATE A PENIS.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.467
I'VE GOT GOOD SPLEEN,
EXCELLENT SPLEEN.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.067
* MR. SPLEEN GETS RID
OF DIRT AND GRIME *

13:40.067 --> 13:41.567
* AND GREASE
IN JUST A MINUTE *

13:41.600 --> 13:44.067
* MR. SPLEEN WILL CLEAN
YOUR WHOLE HOUSE *

13:44.100 --> 13:46.333
* AND EVERYTHING
THAT'S IN IT, MR. SPLEEN *

13:46.367 --> 13:49.533
IF YOU CHANGE MISTER
TO MONSIEUR,

13:49.567 --> 13:51.600
SAY MONSIEUR SPLEEN,

13:51.633 --> 13:53.500
THEN YOU'LL THINK THAT
THE COMMERCIAL WAS,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.433
* MISS YOUR CLEAN,
MISS YOUR CLEAN *

13:58.067 --> 14:00.700
WELL, IT'S
A DEVASTATING ILLNESS,

14:00.733 --> 14:04.067
AND WE JUST APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.767
I'VE NEVER REALLY HEARD OF IT,
WHAT IS IT CALLED ?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.133
GROTE'S SYNDROME.

14:08.167 --> 14:09.167
AND WHAT DOES IT DO ?

14:09.200 --> 14:12.500
WELL, IT'S
A NERVOUS SYSTEM SYNDROME

14:12.533 --> 14:15.267
THAT MAKES PEOPLE EXTREMELY
EXCITED AND NERVOUS,

14:15.300 --> 14:16.300
MY NIECE HAS IT...

14:16.333 --> 14:17.933
OF COURSE, DICK GROTE,
DICK GROTE,

14:17.967 --> 14:19.567
NAMED AFTER DICK GROTE,

14:19.600 --> 14:21.300
THE GUY WHO USED
TO PLAY SHORTSTOP FOR
THE PITTSBURGH PIRATES.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.700
I KNOW, 'CAUSE
HE WAS A BALD GUY.

14:22.733 --> 14:24.367
AND HE DIDN'T
FEEL VERY WELL,

14:24.400 --> 14:27.567
'CAUSE HE WAS VERY EXCITED
ALL THE TIME, IS THAT IT ?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.967
WELL, NO, THE DOCTOR THAT
INITIALLY DIAGNOSED IT,

14:31.067 --> 14:32.300
WAS NAMED GROTE.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.067
YOU SURE IT
WASN'T DICK GROTE ?

14:34.067 --> 14:35.467
YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.333
DR. GROTE MIGHT BE
DICK GROTE'S FATHER,

14:37.367 --> 14:38.400
FOR ALL WE KNOW.

14:38.433 --> 14:40.267
NO ?

14:40.300 --> 14:43.133
NO, MY NIECE
HAS IT, AND...

14:43.167 --> 14:47.233
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CHECK INTO THAT.

14:47.267 --> 14:50.800
SO, HE'S WEARING THIS SKIMPY
KIND OF SPEEDO BATHING SUIT,

14:50.833 --> 14:53.400
HIS BOYS ARE HANGING OUT
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

14:53.433 --> 14:54.967
I'M NOT
GOING BACK THERE.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.500
NO WAY, I CAN'T,
WOULD YOU ?

14:57.533 --> 14:58.567
TO THE BEACH ?

14:58.600 --> 15:00.233
NO, TO THE THERAPIST.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.367
YOURS WILL BE READY
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, SIR.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.600
MIND IF I START ?

15:14.633 --> 15:17.067
OH, HE SAID IT'LL
JUST BE A COUPLE MINUTES.

15:21.300 --> 15:26.233
SO, YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO START, IS THAT IT ?

15:26.267 --> 15:28.067
IT'S A COUPLE MINUTES.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.967
YOU DON'T MIND,
DO YOU ?

15:30.067 --> 15:32.133
I JUST THINK
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

15:32.167 --> 15:35.100
I MEAN, IF YOU HAD
YOUR FOOD COME FIRST,

15:35.133 --> 15:37.067
I WOULD SAY, GO AHEAD AND START,
WHAT DO I CARE ?

15:37.067 --> 15:38.967
WELL, I WOULD WAIT
FOR YOU TO GET YOURS.

15:39.067 --> 15:40.267
I REALLY WOULDN'T
WANT YOU TO WAIT.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.067
I'D BE UNCOMFORTABLE
IF YOU WAITED.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.500
WELL, I'D FEEL IT
WOULD BE POLITE TO WAIT

15:43.533 --> 15:44.800
FOR YOUR FOOD TO ARRIVE.

15:44.833 --> 15:47.200
I THINK IT'S KIND OF IMPOLITE
TO PREVENT A PERSON

15:47.233 --> 15:48.400
WHO IS HUNGRY
FROM EATING.

15:48.433 --> 15:52.267
YEAH, BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HAVING LUNCH TOGETHER.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.767
DO WE HAVE TO START
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME ?

15:53.800 --> 15:54.900
I DON'T GET THAT.

15:54.933 --> 15:56.933
WELL, I DON'T SEE WHY
YOU CAN'T WAIT TWO SECONDS

15:56.967 --> 15:58.867
FOR YOUR COLD SANDWICH,
IT'S NOT EVEN HOT.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.700
WELL, I DON'T SEE WHY YOU CARE
IF I TAKE A BITE OF MY FOOD.

16:01.733 --> 16:02.833
HOW DOES
THAT BOTHER YOU ?

16:02.867 --> 16:05.067
BECAUSE WE'RE
HAVING LUNCH TOGETHER.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.433
THE TWO OF ?

16:15.433 --> 16:16.600
THANKS.

16:16.633 --> 16:18.167
HEY, ROB.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.333
THANKS FOR SWITCHING
APPOINTMENTS WITH ME.

16:20.367 --> 16:21.467
YEAH, NO, PROBLEM.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.533
LARRY, WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THAT LUNCH ?

16:23.567 --> 16:24.867
OH, MAN, UM...

16:24.900 --> 16:25.967
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

16:26.067 --> 16:27.133
I'M SORRY, I JUST.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.167
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

16:28.200 --> 16:29.633
I FELT SO MUCH PRESSURE

16:29.667 --> 16:32.133
FROM THE FACT THAT
THIS GUY HAD PAID $4,000,

16:32.167 --> 16:37.233
AND I TRIED TOO HARD TO
BE ENTERTAINING AND AFFABLE.

16:37.267 --> 16:39.167
SO, YOU TOLD HIM
THAT GROTE'S SYNDROME

16:39.200 --> 16:41.300
WAS NAMED AFTER THE SHORTSTOP
FOR THE PITTSBURGH PIRATES,

16:41.333 --> 16:42.500
DICK GROTE ?

16:42.533 --> 16:44.400
I DIDN'T SAY THAT AS A FACT,
I SPECULATED, BECAUSE...

16:44.433 --> 16:45.867
SPECULATED ?

16:45.900 --> 16:48.533
YEAH, WELL, 'CAUSE LOU GEHRIG
HAD A DISEASE NAMED AFTER HIM.

16:48.567 --> 16:50.067
AND DICK GROTE
WAS A BALL PLAYER.

16:50.067 --> 16:51.167
I THOUGHT IT
WAS A POSSIBILITY.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.967
DIDN'T YOU READ ANY OF
THE LITERATURE I SENT YOU ?

16:53.067 --> 16:54.533
IT DEPRESSES ME
TO READ THAT STUFF.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.433
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE AGREED TO DO IT.

16:56.467 --> 16:58.333
I WAS JUST HAVING LUNCH
WITH THE GUY.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.600
I KNOW, BUT LARRY,
THAT'S ANOTHER THING.

17:00.633 --> 17:04.100
YOU START EATING
BEFORE HE GETS HIS FOOD ?

17:04.133 --> 17:06.500
WHAT KIND OF, I MEAN,
GROTE'S OR NO GROTE'S,

17:06.533 --> 17:10.733
I MEAN,
WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS ?

17:10.767 --> 17:13.333
I ASKED IF HE WOULDN'T MIND,
I WAS STARVING.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.433
AND WHAT DID HE SAY ?

17:14.467 --> 17:15.567
HE SAYS HE DID MIND.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.933
AND YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN THAT
AS YOUR CUE TO WAIT

17:17.967 --> 17:21.067
'TIL HIS FOOD ARRIVED,
SO THAT YOU COULD START EATING.

17:21.067 --> 17:22.567
MEANWHILE,
THE GUY'S INSULTED.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.533
I SAID TO HIM, "DO YOU MIND
IF I START", AND HE SAID "YES".

17:24.567 --> 17:27.433
NOW WHAT KIND OF PERSON SAYS YES
TO "DO YOU MIND IF I START" ?

17:27.467 --> 17:29.200
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
WHO WOULD SAY YES TO THAT ?

17:29.233 --> 17:31.300
HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING
TO CANCEL THE $4,000 CHECK,

17:31.333 --> 17:35.467
UNLESS, YOU KNOW,
I WAS LIKE, SEARCHING.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.433
I SAID, "IS THERE
ANYTHING WE CAN DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU ?"

17:38.467 --> 17:39.933
AND HE SAID, "WELL,
MAYBE IF LARRY WOULD

17:39.967 --> 17:42.133
"GET MORE INVOLVED
AND SHOW THAT HE REALLY CARED

17:42.167 --> 17:44.200
"ABOUT GROTE'S SYNDROME,
MAYBE THEN,

17:44.233 --> 17:45.467
I WOULD AGREE
TO GIVE THE MONEY."

17:45.500 --> 17:49.467
AND I SUGGESTED, "WELL,
IF LARRY WOULD AGREE TO HOST

17:49.500 --> 17:50.967
"THE GROTE'S SYNDROME
TALENT SHOW,

17:51.067 --> 17:54.133
MAYBE, HE COULD MAKE IT
UP TO YOU THAT WAY",

17:54.167 --> 17:56.633
AND HE SAID HE WOULD AGREE
TO MAKE HIS DONATION

17:56.667 --> 18:01.067
IF YOU WOULD AGREE TO HOST
THE TALENT SHOW.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.067
COULDN'T I JUST
WRITE THE CHECK ?

18:03.067 --> 18:05.833
LARRY, THAT'S
NOT THE POINT.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.300
IT'S NOT JUST
THE GIVING MONEY.

18:07.333 --> 18:11.367
IT'S GETTING INVOLVED,
YOU KNOW, IN GROTE'S.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.300
IT'S BEING,
GROTE'S ACTIVE.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.100
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,

18:16.133 --> 18:17.567
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS YOU SHOW UP,

18:17.600 --> 18:20.367
YOU SAY A FEW THINGS,
YOU MAKE A COUPLE OF JOKES,

18:20.400 --> 18:24.267
AND THEN YOU INTRODUCE
THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE SHOW.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.800
THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE,
BY THE WAY,
WITH GROTE'S SYNDROME.

18:26.833 --> 18:29.467
THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE
WHO WILL DEMONSTRATE

18:29.500 --> 18:32.500
THAT YOU CAN HAVE A LIFE
WITH GROTE'S SYNDROME,

18:32.533 --> 18:35.400
AND YOU CAN BE ACTIVE
AND TALENTED AND ALL OF THAT.

18:35.433 --> 18:37.733
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW LUNCH COULD COME,

18:37.767 --> 18:41.467
AND IT'S RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOU, AND...

18:41.500 --> 18:44.333
IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE
YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

18:44.367 --> 18:46.200
AND YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT UP TO THEM,

18:46.233 --> 18:48.300
THEN FINE,
GO YOUR MERRY WAY.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.633
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LOSE THE CHECK,

18:50.667 --> 18:53.433
WELL, THIS WOULD GO A LONG WAY
TO HELPING US SECURE THAT CHECK,

18:53.467 --> 18:56.700
AND I THINK ALSO,
DO QUITE A BIT

18:56.733 --> 18:58.900
IN RAISING SOME CONSCIOUSNESS
ABOUT GROTE'S.

18:58.933 --> 19:01.300
THEY STILL TRUST ME NOW,
THEY WOULD WANT ME TO DO THAT ?

19:01.333 --> 19:02.333
MAYBE...

19:04.567 --> 19:08.367
OKAY, ALRIGHT.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.933
ALRIGHT, WELL,
THANKS A LOT.

19:09.967 --> 19:11.067
YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT ?

19:11.067 --> 19:12.067
I DEFINITELY WILL.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.067
FEEL GOOD.

19:13.067 --> 19:14.067
ALRIGHT, YOU TOO.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.100
OKAY, I DO.

19:15.133 --> 19:16.100
GOODBYE.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.633
HELLO.

19:24.667 --> 19:28.067
HELLO.

19:28.067 --> 19:32.333
WELL, I'VE GOT SOME...

19:33.300 --> 19:35.367
SOME BIG NEWS.

19:35.400 --> 19:39.133
AND THE NEWS IS
THAT...

19:40.067 --> 19:42.500
I THINK I'M ALL BETTER.

19:42.533 --> 19:43.833
REALLY ?

19:43.867 --> 19:45.633
I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD.

19:45.667 --> 19:49.667
PRETTY, PRETTY, PRETTY,

19:49.700 --> 19:52.633
PRETTY, PRETTY GOOD.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.533
WHAT HAPPENED ?

19:54.567 --> 19:57.233
I HAD AN EPIPHANY.

19:57.267 --> 20:01.367
AND I'M JUST,
MY WHOLE LIFE IS IN PERSPECTIVE.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.933
I FEEL GREAT.

20:03.967 --> 20:06.267
WHAT WAS YOUR EPIPHANY ?

20:06.300 --> 20:08.000
I'M READY TO TERMINATE.

20:08.033 --> 20:09.700
I'M TERMINATING.
I THINK I CAN TERMINATE.

20:09.733 --> 20:11.300
THAT'S WONDERFUL, LARRY.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.433
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM ?
I'M THE TERMINATOR.

20:13.467 --> 20:16.267
I AM THE TERMINATOR.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.567
WAS IT THE BEACH ?

20:17.600 --> 20:18.867
WAS IT GOING TO
THE BEACH THAT DID IT ?

20:18.900 --> 20:21.300
OH, I DIDN'T
GO TO THE BEACH.

20:23.167 --> 20:25.567
I WENT SHOPPING
WITH MY WIFE, AND...

20:25.600 --> 20:27.600
WHICH IS EVEN BETTER,
TO GOT SHOPPING WITH HER,

20:27.633 --> 20:28.600
IMAGINE THAT.

20:28.633 --> 20:29.733
NO BEACH ?

20:29.767 --> 20:31.467
I DIDN'T GO
TO THE BEACH, NO.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.600
BUT HERE'S THE THING
THAT I WANT TO SAY.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.200
EVERY NOW AND THEN,
I'M SURE I'LL HAVE A PROBLEM

20:35.233 --> 20:36.300
THAT'S GONNA COME UP.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.600
I WOULD LOVE TO
BE ABLE TO COME BACK.

20:37.633 --> 20:40.800
YOU KNOW, JUST
INTERMITTENTLY IF I CAN,

20:40.833 --> 20:43.067
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME,
I HOPE YOU WILL.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.800
JUST TO KIND OF HAVE
A LITTLE REFRESHER COURSE,

20:46.833 --> 20:48.433
JUST IN CASE THINGS
START TO GO OFF AGAIN.

20:48.467 --> 20:52.333
SO, NOW YOU FEEL
ALL THESE THINGS
THAT WERE UPSETTING YOU--

20:52.367 --> 20:54.033
YES, I DON'T NEED TO
COME IN REGULARLY ANYMORE.

20:54.067 --> 20:56.133
ALL THE PROBLEMS,
THE JASON ALEXANDER...

20:56.167 --> 20:59.300
JASON ALEXANDER,
YEAH, WHAT ?

20:59.333 --> 21:00.867
I GO TO HIS OFFICE
FOR A MEETING,

21:00.900 --> 21:02.500
HE WANTS ME TO GO BACK THERE
FOR THE NEXT MEETING.

21:02.533 --> 21:03.833
YOU SEE HOW AGITATED
YOU ARE LARRY ?

21:03.867 --> 21:07.133
WELL, I MEAN, THAT'S A SITUATION
THAT I FIND RATHER ANNOYING.

21:07.167 --> 21:08.667
YEAH, BUT THAT'S OKAY,
THAT'S OKAY.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.700
NO, I MEAN, 'CAUSE YOU
JUST GOT THROUGH SAYING,

21:10.733 --> 21:11.967
HOW GREAT YOU FEEL.

21:12.067 --> 21:13.733
I DO FEEL GREAT.

21:13.767 --> 21:16.900
BUT, IF YOU'RE GONNA
REMIND ME OF THE HOLOCAUST,

21:16.933 --> 21:17.900
I'M NOT GONNA
FEEL SO GREAT.

21:17.933 --> 21:18.900
FRANKLY, LARRY,
YOU SEE--

21:18.933 --> 21:21.533
I DON'T REALLY THINK
I NEED TO COME.

21:21.567 --> 21:22.933
YOU SEEM
AGITATED TODAY.

21:22.967 --> 21:24.533
AGITATED ?

21:24.567 --> 21:27.967
NO, WHAT YOU'RE
SEEING AS AGITATION
IS ACTUALLY EBULLIENCE.

21:28.067 --> 21:29.867
YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN ME EBULLIENT,

21:29.900 --> 21:31.367
SO YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.167
"WHO AM I ?"
YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.567
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.767
WHO ARE YOU ?

21:37.800 --> 21:40.133
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH,

21:40.167 --> 21:41.467
LEST I DISSIPATE IT.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.067
I MEAN...

21:44.100 --> 21:47.900
I SEE SWINGS OF EMOTION
THAT THAT DISTURB ME

21:47.933 --> 21:48.900
A LITTLE BIT, LARRY.

21:48.933 --> 21:49.933
THERE'S NO SWING.

21:49.967 --> 21:50.967
I'M A HAMMOCK.

21:51.067 --> 21:52.667
A HAMMOCK
IS VERY PLACID.

21:52.700 --> 21:53.967
A HAMMOCK ?

21:54.067 --> 21:57.833
YEAH, JUST GENTLY FLOWING
IN THE IN THE BREEZE, THAT'S ME.

21:57.867 --> 21:59.167
I MUST TELL YOU, LARRY,

21:59.200 --> 22:01.833
YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE
GENTLY FLOWING IN THE BREEZE.

22:01.867 --> 22:03.433
YOU'VE BEEN IN THERAPY
FOR A WHILE,

22:03.467 --> 22:05.067
I KNOW YOU PRETTY WELL.

22:05.067 --> 22:08.900
I FEEL BAD THAT YOU
ARE SUCH A GOOD THERAPIST,

22:08.933 --> 22:12.067
THAT YOU'RE KIND OF A VICTIM
OF YOUR OWN TALENTS AND SKILLS,

22:12.100 --> 22:13.533
THAT YOU HAVE
TO LOSE A PATIENT

22:13.567 --> 22:15.300
BECAUSE OF THE JOB
THAT YOU DID.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.600
IT'S UNFORTUNATE,
I'M SORRY.

22:17.633 --> 22:20.067
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M LOSING YOU

22:20.100 --> 22:21.700
FOR THE REASON
THAT YOU'RE SAYING.

22:21.733 --> 22:23.400
OH, YEAH,
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

22:23.433 --> 22:25.733
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU
WERE AT THE BEACH, LARRY.

22:25.767 --> 22:29.367
I WAS NOT AT THE BEACH.

22:29.400 --> 22:33.067
SO, IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE THONG ?

22:42.200 --> 22:43.200
SO ?

22:43.233 --> 22:44.667
HE'S ON TO US.

22:44.700 --> 22:45.867
HE KNOWS ABOUT
THE WHOLE THONG THING,

22:45.900 --> 22:46.867
HE KNOWS
ALL ABOUT IT.

22:46.900 --> 22:47.900
HE KNOWS ABOUT
THE THONG THING.

22:47.933 --> 22:48.900
HE'S ON TO US ?

22:48.933 --> 22:50.067
HE'S ON TO ME.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.533
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN ?
HE'S ON TO ME NOW.

22:52.567 --> 22:53.533
HE'LL BE ON TO YOU.

22:53.567 --> 22:54.533
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN ?

22:54.567 --> 22:55.633
WHO TOLD HIM ?

22:55.667 --> 22:58.067
I HAD THIS LUNCH
WITH THAT GUY FOR THE CHARITY,

22:58.067 --> 22:59.200
AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT IT,

22:59.233 --> 23:01.200
HE MUST'VE TOLD ROB REINER,
ROB MUST'VE TOLD HIM.

23:01.233 --> 23:03.767
WHY WOULD ROB EVEN,
OH, CHRIST.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.367
IT MUST HAVE CAME UP SOMEHOW,
I DON'T KNOW.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.500
SO WHAT HAPPENED ?

23:06.533 --> 23:08.333
ARE YOU OUT OF THERE ?

23:08.367 --> 23:09.333
I'M OUT, YEAH.

23:09.367 --> 23:10.533
HOW ?

23:10.567 --> 23:13.300
I TOLD HIM I WAS HAPPY
AND I DIDN'T NEED THE THERAPY.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.400
YOU TOLD HIM WHAT ?

23:14.433 --> 23:15.500
I TOLD HIM
I WAS HAPPY.

23:15.533 --> 23:17.067
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TELLING HIM.

23:17.067 --> 23:18.233
HOW CAN YOU STEAL
MY TERMINATION ?

23:18.267 --> 23:19.367
I DIDN'T STEAL
YOUR TERMINATION.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.733
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
GONNA SAY YOU WERE HAPPY.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.067
HOW ELSE AM I GONNA
LEAVE A SHRINK ?

23:23.067 --> 23:24.300
HOW THE FUCK
DO I KNOW ?

23:24.333 --> 23:26.933
I'M MISERABLE AND I'M SUICIDAL,
I WANT TO LEAVE ?

23:26.967 --> 23:28.067
SO, WHAT AM
I GONNA DO ?

23:28.067 --> 23:30.067
TELL HIM YOU'RE
A SCIENTOLOGIST OR SOMETHING.

23:30.067 --> 23:31.100
I'M NOT A SCIENTOLOGIST.

23:31.133 --> 23:32.400
TELL HIM YOU'RE
INTO SCIENTOLOGY.

23:32.433 --> 23:34.633
OH, IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY,
I'M A SHRINK PERSON.

23:34.667 --> 23:36.300
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
YOU NEED SOMETHING TO GET OUT.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.333
TELL HIM YOU
WENT TO SCIENTOLOGY.

23:37.367 --> 23:39.467
NO, I NEED A BETTER EXCUSE.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.867
OH, LOOK, WHAT IS THIS ?
THIS IS WHAT ?

23:41.900 --> 23:44.667
IS THIS THE BEVERLY CENTER,
THIS THING ?

23:44.700 --> 23:46.067
THIS IS SO,
LOOK AT THIS,

23:46.067 --> 23:47.067
WITH THE LEATHER,
THE WHOLE THING HERE.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.400
OH, HI, DOC,
NO, THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

23:48.433 --> 23:50.067
YEAH, OKAY.

23:50.067 --> 23:52.133
HEY, LISTEN,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

23:52.167 --> 23:54.367
STAY FEELING GOOD,
I FEEL GREAT TOO.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.067
YEAH, OKAY, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THAT BOOK AGAIN,

23:56.067 --> 23:57.067
"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA" ?

23:57.100 --> 23:58.133
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST...

23:58.167 --> 24:00.233
OKAY, I'LL LOOK,
I'LL CHECK THAT OUT,

24:00.267 --> 24:01.300
IT'S A MOVIE TOO,
ISN'T IT ?

24:01.333 --> 24:04.333
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24:04.367 --> 24:06.733
I'M VERY HAPPY,
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

24:06.767 --> 24:08.100
HOW ARE YOU ?

24:08.133 --> 24:09.600
GOOD, HOW ARE YOU ?

24:09.633 --> 24:11.833
I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

24:11.867 --> 24:17.933
* GROTE'S, WE'RE NOT
AS HYPER AS WE SEEM *

24:17.967 --> 24:24.267

26:01.200 --> 26:03.333
YOU CAN'T
LET HER DO THIS.

26:03.367 --> 26:05.567
I DON'T KNOW
