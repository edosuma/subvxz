has asked me to weigh
all the evidence

11:21.718 --> 11:23.117
before classifying refugees.

11:23.119 --> 11:24.519
What evidence do you have
to the contrary?

11:24.521 --> 11:26.487
That is confidential.

11:26.489 --> 11:27.889
But, let me assure you,

11:27.891 --> 11:29.824
Omar Risha will have
a fair hearing.

11:29.826 --> 11:31.392
Now if you'll excuse me.

11:31.394 --> 11:33.028
Look, I get it.

11:33.030 --> 11:34.462
Just tell me...

11:34.464 --> 11:36.997
what's the going rate?

11:36.999 --> 11:38.332
Are you insane?

11:38.334 --> 11:41.035
I am not leaving
until I get an answer.

11:41.037 --> 11:42.370
(Lapointe) - Security!
- Excuse me, ma'am.

11:42.372 --> 11:44.738
Please come with us.

11:44.740 --> 11:46.140

Sorry, gentlemen.

11:46.142 --> 11:47.375

11:47.377 --> 11:49.643
It's okay, I know her.

[Overlapping chatter]

12:00.221 --> 12:01.655

12:01.657 --> 12:03.023
Maria was about
to get tossed out

12:03.025 --> 12:07.094

12:07.096 --> 12:09.196
You work with Ken Davis.

12:09.198 --> 12:10.363
He's a friend.

12:10.365 --> 12:12.399
I'm sorry about all this.

12:12.401 --> 12:13.933
I don't wanna burden you
with my problems.

12:13.935 --> 12:15.569
What's this all about?

12:15.571 --> 12:18.838
My former interpreter from Iraq

12:18.840 --> 12:21.040
is being held
on suspicion of terrorism

12:21.042 --> 12:22.209
and might be deported.

12:22.211 --> 12:25.011
I know it's a false allegation.

12:25.013 --> 12:26.679
But that jerk won't believe me.

12:26.681 --> 12:30.016
Monsieur Lapointe
may be lazy, even corrupt,

12:30.018 --> 12:31.183
but you don't get
all that power

12:31.185 --> 12:33.720
by being a nice guy.

12:33.722 --> 12:35.755
There are ways
around men like him.

12:35.757 --> 12:38.224
I don't know what else to do.

12:38.226 --> 12:40.025
Perhaps I can help.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.729

12:43.731 --> 12:46.365
the United Nations would never
accomplish anything.

12:46.367 --> 12:48.400
Unfortunately, some

12:57.044 --> 12:59.477
Thank you.

found herself a white knight.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.749

13:10.724 --> 13:12.823
He raises funds to support
reconstruction projects

13:12.825 --> 13:15.593
like the one Maria worked on
in Iraq.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.895
Well, he's offered to help
get Omar into the country.

13:17.897 --> 13:20.265
Let's hope that he doesn't live
to regret that decision.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.400
We need to get a look
at that evidence against Omar.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.735
Sounds like Omar could use
a good lawyer.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.172
Perhaps it's time
Mr. Reese and I

13:27.174 --> 13:31.008
did a little pro bono work.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.913
How can I help you
and your associates,

13:35.915 --> 13:37.014
Mr. Kingfisher?

13:37.016 --> 13:40.284
My firm represents
several refugees

13:40.286 --> 13:41.585
who worked for
the US government in Iraq

13:41.587 --> 13:43.087
now seeking asylum.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.289
There are concerns
about refugees from Iraq

13:45.291 --> 13:46.590
immigrating to the US.

13:46.592 --> 13:47.824
Yes, we're--
we're aware.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.459
One of our clients--
Omar Risha--

13:49.461 --> 13:54.030
is being detained for
alleged links to terrorism.

13:54.032 --> 13:56.366
I know Monsieur Risha's
case well.

13:56.368 --> 14:01.171
In fact, I have to make a
final decision on it this week.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.709
May I?

14:05.711 --> 14:07.310
If I'm to prepare
a legal defense,

14:07.312 --> 14:09.212
I require all of the facts.

14:09.214 --> 14:11.815
You may review it, but here.

14:11.817 --> 14:13.649
Thank you.

14:13.651 --> 14:16.953
I received that letter from
the Iraqi government last week.

14:16.955 --> 14:19.222
The Ministry of the Interior
say they have proof

14:19.224 --> 14:22.625
that Omar is involved
in terrorist activity.

14:22.627 --> 14:24.126
I'm sorry.

14:24.128 --> 14:28.464
Um, the Ministry of the Interior
is hardly reliable.

14:28.466 --> 14:30.333
It's full of
former Shia militia members.

14:30.335 --> 14:33.135
They view Iraqis
that helped American forces

14:33.137 --> 14:34.837
as traitors.

14:34.839 --> 14:36.238
Three years ago, two terrorists

14:36.240 --> 14:38.006
who killed US soldiers in Iraq

14:38.008 --> 14:40.909
were discovered living
in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.911
They fooled
Immigration officials

14:42.913 --> 14:45.047
by posing
as former interpreters.

14:45.049 --> 14:47.349
Yes, but, surely,
such an isolated case

14:47.351 --> 14:50.018
should not affect the plight
of thousands.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.720
I can't afford
to put my signature

14:51.722 --> 14:54.088
on an application
of a potential terrorist,

14:54.090 --> 14:56.858
however small the probability.

14:56.860 --> 14:59.527
If one more terrorist
slips through,

14:59.529 --> 15:01.596
it will jeopardize
all the other refugees

15:01.598 --> 15:02.764
seeking asylum.

15:02.766 --> 15:04.499
You understand.

Why are you trying to get
Omar Risha into the US?

18:20.701 --> 18:23.769
Omar was my interpreter
on my last project.

18:23.771 --> 18:26.372
We were in a convoy

18:33.481 --> 18:35.147
and shot two of the terrorists.

18:35.149 --> 18:38.050
The rest fled.

He saved my life.

18:39.787 --> 18:43.488
Sounds like he deserves a medal.

After I left Iraq,

18:45.858 --> 18:47.958
Omar started receiving
death threats.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.563
If he's sent back,
he'll be killed.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.565
What do French legionnaires
have to do with this?

18:53.567 --> 18:56.634
I don't know.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.636
The day before Omar left,
he wanted to talk to me

18:59.638 --> 19:02.539
about some generators
that went missing in Iraq.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.809
He didn't wanna talk
about it on the phone.

19:05.811 --> 19:09.313
The Iraqi Ministry
of the Interior

19:09.315 --> 19:11.315
sent this letter to the UN

19:11.317 --> 19:15.218
stating that Omar has links
to terrorist groups.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.253
This is not true.

19:17.255 --> 19:19.322
Why would someone do this?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.857
Detective Fusco arrested
the injured legionnaire.

19:20.859 --> 19:23.193
Perhaps, when he wakes up,
he can answer that question.

19:23.195 --> 19:26.429

a foreign intelligence service.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.064
They could also be working

19:28.066 --> 19:29.065

Lapointe.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.566
His last post

19:30.568 --> 19:31.834
was head of UN peacekeeping
in the Congo.

19:31.836 --> 19:33.936
Among the units
under his control

19:33.938 --> 19:36.038
was a company
of French legionnaires.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.607
Why would Lapointe wanna kill me

get into the US?

19:40.678 --> 19:41.844

19:41.846 --> 19:43.178
He could shed some light
on this.

It's impossible.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.415
He's being held incommunicado.

20:27.156 --> 20:29.956
Maria told us how
you saved her life in Iraq.

I'm sorry I don't have
more proof,

20:31.126 --> 20:33.059
but we don't have much time.

20:33.061 --> 20:34.561
Last night,
a team of legionnaires

20:34.563 --> 20:35.829
made an attempt on Maria's life.

20:35.831 --> 20:38.899
What?

20:38.901 --> 20:40.333
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

20:40.335 --> 20:43.403
And she's in a safe place.

20:43.405 --> 20:44.604
But there
was something important

20:44.606 --> 20:46.072
you wanted to tell Maria

20:46.074 --> 20:49.509
during your last conversation?

20:49.511 --> 20:52.445
About the generators.

20:52.447 --> 20:54.480
The ones at the energy project

20:54.482 --> 20:58.351
that she worked on in Iraq?

20:58.353 --> 21:01.020
After Maria left,

21:01.022 --> 21:03.690
the generators
were never installed.

21:03.692 --> 21:07.960
The hydroelectric plant failed.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.995
The entire province went dark.

21:09.997 --> 21:12.464

Al-Qaeda moved back in.

21:20.607 --> 21:21.941
What happened to the generators?

21:21.943 --> 21:24.176
That's what I wanted
to tell Maria.

21:24.178 --> 21:27.346
Right before I left,
I translated a contract

21:27.348 --> 21:28.880
for the transportation
of six generators.

21:28.882 --> 21:34.619
A contract signed by whom?

21:34.621 --> 21:36.621
Are you sure
you can protect Maria?

21:36.623 --> 21:37.723
Yes.

21:37.725 --> 21:40.191
Why?

21:40.193 --> 21:42.227
Because it was her boss.

21:42.229 --> 21:43.394
Ken Davis.

21:43.396 --> 21:46.397
Davis?

21:46.399 --> 21:48.799
Why would he ship generators
all the way to Iraq

21:48.801 --> 21:51.236
only to turn around
and ship them somewhere else?

21:51.238 --> 21:53.838
Maybe he got a better offer.
