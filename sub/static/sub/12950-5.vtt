00:01.234 --> 00:03.964
<i>Seven years ago, I was
recruited to work for SD-6,</i>

00:04.070 --> 00:06.338
<i>which I was told
was a covert branch of the CIA.</i>

00:06.339 --> 00:08.073
<i>I was trained as a spy,</i>

00:08.074 --> 00:10.574
<i>warned not to tell anyone
what I did.</i>

00:10.643 --> 00:12.644
<i>I thought I was working
for the good guys,</i>

00:12.645 --> 00:15.580
<i>until I told my fianc√©
about SD-6</i>

00:15.648 --> 00:16.749
<i>and they had him killed.</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:18.384
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:18.385 --> 00:21.548
<i>That SD-6 is part of the very
enemy I thought I was fighting.</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:23.188
<i>Now I'm a double agent,</i>

00:23.189 --> 00:26.090
<i>working with the real CIA
to bring down SD-6,</i>

00:26.159 --> 00:28.160
<i>where my only ally
is another double agent,</i>

00:28.161 --> 00:29.928
<i>a man I hardly know.</i>

00:29.929 --> 00:31.263
<i>My father.</i>

00:31.264 --> 00:33.699
You think the winner
of the Edgar Peace Prize

00:33.700 --> 00:35.034
is working with Luc Jacqnoud?

00:35.035 --> 00:37.535
Dhiren Patel is India's
delegate to the U.N.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.805
There is no way
he's working with Jacqnoud.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.507
Your objective
is to monitor the meeting,

00:41.508 --> 00:43.809
I.D. The client,
and make sure whatever it is

00:43.810 --> 00:46.011
that Jacqnoud is up to
doesn't happen.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.980
If Patel's going to be
our deliveryman,

00:47.981 --> 00:50.541
I'll need the piece
by tomorrow.

00:50.617 --> 00:53.117
<i>Salud.</i>

00:53.520 --> 00:55.187
Damn it.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.322
The little guy's bodyguard.
I know him.

00:57.323 --> 00:58.457
From Corsica two years ago.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.459
The son of a bitch
broke my arm.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.061
You. I know you.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.293
The man that Jacqnoud
is meeting with is Malik Suari.

01:05.364 --> 01:08.334
He specializes
in industrial demolition.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.995
You think Jacqnoud is going to
plant an explosive on Patel.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.273
Yes, I do, and I want
you two to stop it.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.774
- I have a 20 on Patel.
- Let's get him out of here.

01:16.776 --> 01:19.078
Something's wrong.
He looks sick.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.312
He just went down.

01:20.313 --> 01:21.413
If they're bombing this place,

01:21.414 --> 01:23.914
it's going to be tomorrow.
Opening ceremonies.

01:23.983 --> 01:26.816
Uh, careful with that.
That's TNT.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.386
Yes, don't kill us, please.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.032 --> 01:41.532
Recognize me now?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.272
Anyone else?

01:48.842 --> 01:51.342
Keep looking.

02:16.002 --> 02:19.130
I never did find out
what you were doing in Corsica.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.540
Are you working for Dimitri?

02:28.581 --> 02:32.483
Tell me now,
or you're going into the fire.

02:34.554 --> 02:37.054
Who sent you here?

02:37.757 --> 02:39.525
Are you here alone?

02:39.526 --> 02:41.860
Who sent you here?

02:41.861 --> 02:42.928
Answer me!

02:42.929 --> 02:45.429
Little bitch.

03:00.313 --> 03:04.044
Get to level "C" now.
She got away.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.154
Oh, my God.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.654
What time is it?

04:18.791 --> 04:19.958
Um...

04:25.765 --> 04:27.332
Dixon, it's me.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.893
Thank God. Where have you been?
I didn't sleep.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.670
That doesn't matter.
Listen to me.

04:31.671 --> 04:32.871
Have you spotted Patel?

04:32.872 --> 04:35.602
He just showed up.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.909
News agencies are reporting
he had an arrhythmia.

04:37.910 --> 04:38.844
Where'd they take him?

04:38.845 --> 04:41.746
What I'm about to say, Dixon,
you have to believe me.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.015
Of course.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.950
The bomb we're looking for?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.151
It's inside of him.

04:46.152 --> 04:48.712
- What?
- Inside Patel.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.522
They implanted the bomb
into his chest

04:50.523 --> 04:51.857
like it was a pacemaker.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.592
A simple
outpatient procedure.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.394
Jacqnoud just turned
an Edgar Peace Prize winner

04:55.395 --> 04:57.955
into a human bomb,
which is not good.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.831
Did you see the device?

04:59.832 --> 05:00.966
Yeah, it's small.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.934
Which means it's probably
on a wireless remote.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.036
Get Patel.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.138
I'll meet you directly
behind the auditorium.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.639
I'll get there
as soon as I can.

06:04.163 --> 06:08.259
Ladies and gentlemen...
it is my honor

06:08.334 --> 06:12.964
to officially open
the 2001 Ministerial Conference

06:13.072 --> 06:16.041
of the United Commerce
Organization.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.524
Hey!

07:16.769 --> 07:18.670
Please welcome
our keynote speaker.

07:18.671 --> 07:22.004
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dhiren Patel.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.240
I just punched Dhiren Patel
in the face.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.183
- Any luck with the trigger?
- I worship this man.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.709
When you were in the building,
did you I.D. The trigger?!

07:33.786 --> 07:36.286
No, I didn't see anyone.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.927
Oh, God.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.034
Please wait one moment.
I will be right back.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.745
I know you've been
field-trained basic medical,

08:07.820 --> 08:09.020
but can you really do this?

08:09.021 --> 08:10.755
Pull a bomb out of
a man's chest?

08:10.756 --> 08:12.424
Yeah.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.164
It's Jacqnoud.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.741
Don't forget.
This thing's on a remote.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.150
We can't let them get
within range.

08:48.828 --> 08:51.328
Get me closer.

08:53.599 --> 08:56.099
Get me closer!

09:07.046 --> 09:08.346
I can feel it.

09:08.347 --> 09:10.248
Oh, God.

09:16.656 --> 09:17.822
The police have a roadblock.

09:17.823 --> 09:20.323
- Get around it.
- Oh, God.

09:38.044 --> 09:39.678
Get me closer!

09:39.679 --> 09:41.546
You've got to hurry!

09:41.547 --> 09:43.748
They put an adhesive
on the incision.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.051
It must have bled through.
It's stuck!

09:47.753 --> 09:50.253
What?

09:54.093 --> 09:56.593
Closer.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.400
- Oh, God.
- Wait.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.104
What's that?!

10:06.105 --> 10:09.597
It's on a delay.
Just keep driving!

10:09.709 --> 10:10.842
Now.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.822
Nicely done.

10:29.428 --> 10:31.229
You're gonna be okay.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.535
- That's insane.
- No kidding.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.604
- Dixon pulled it out of him?
- Yeah.

10:39.605 --> 10:42.733
- Pulled the bomb out of Patel?
- The very one.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.242
Any luck
with The Alliance member?

10:44.243 --> 10:45.510
The what?

10:45.511 --> 10:46.544
You were supposed to I.D.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.380
The minister SD-6
has been trying to protect.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.215
Thanks, I remember.
No, I didn't get it.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.550
Sydney, if we're gonna
take down SD-6...

10:52.551 --> 10:54.352
I was busy trying to keep

10:54.353 --> 10:56.878
one of the most important
humanitarians on the planet

10:56.956 --> 10:57.956
from blowing up!

10:57.957 --> 11:00.457
Fine.

11:02.461 --> 11:05.919
Anyway, I have a paper
to finish.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.169
Hey.

11:12.538 --> 11:15.564
I have something for you.

11:18.978 --> 11:21.879
I know you have a lot
of questions about your father.

11:21.947 --> 11:25.075
I don't know
if you want this...

11:25.151 --> 11:27.651
but I copied his file.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.695
Thank you.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.966
Sorry I'm late.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.663
Hey. It's after 1:00 already?

12:50.736 --> 12:51.870
Yeah, it's 1:30.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.404
Oh, God,
you gotta be kidding.

12:53.405 --> 12:56.568
Okay, so I'm in my operations
and technology management class,

12:56.675 --> 12:58.176
and I realize two things.

12:58.177 --> 12:59.744
One, I prepared
the wrong chapter.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.312
- No!
- I don't want to talk about it.

13:01.313 --> 13:04.009
And two, you and I are
gonna have a Halloween party.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.583
- We are?
- Guest list.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.086
- Oh!
- What, is it too big?

13:10.156 --> 13:12.557
I think you put down everyone
we've met since seventh grade.

13:12.558 --> 13:13.825
You invited Kenny.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.760
So? He's a kid.
It's Halloween.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.562
Francie, if you want to see
Charlie again,

13:17.563 --> 13:19.764
you don't have to throw
a massive Halloween party

13:19.765 --> 13:20.799
and invite his nephew.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.667
- I love Kenny.
- I know you do.

13:22.668 --> 13:25.899
But just admit.
You're hoping, just a little,

13:26.005 --> 13:27.939
that Charlie will bring him.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.309
What?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.011
Is that Will?

13:33.012 --> 13:36.106
Maybe he's here to talk to you
about the humiliating kiss.

13:36.182 --> 13:38.682
- Stop calling it that.
- That's what it was.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.052
I gotta call you back.

13:41.053 --> 13:44.022
I'll call you back.
Bye.

13:44.089 --> 13:44.722
Hey.

13:44.723 --> 13:45.757
What are you doing here?

13:45.758 --> 13:47.192
Oh, I got this, uh...

13:47.193 --> 13:49.394
I'm writing a story on SATs.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.895
About how
the university is...

13:51.931 --> 13:53.998
- What are you guys doing?
- Getting lunch.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.733
We're having a Halloween
party on Wednesday night.

13:55.734 --> 13:57.869
Excellent. I don't have to wear
a costume, do I?

13:57.870 --> 13:59.737
- No.
- Yeah.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.673
Really?
That's... confusing.

14:05.411 --> 14:06.978
Let me guess.
The bank.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.641
It's a meeting with the
higher-ups on these bad loans.

14:09.715 --> 14:11.182
Okay, seriously.
Your job?

14:11.183 --> 14:12.250
It's a problem, right?

14:12.251 --> 14:14.719
- I should go.
- We know.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.754
- I'll call you guys later, okay?
- Okay.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.523
See ya.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.158
This is Hensel Corporation.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.560
A Germany-based
chemical conglomerate.

14:22.561 --> 14:25.257
They make Ibuprofen,
hand lotion, toothpaste.

14:25.331 --> 14:26.798
They also have
a multi-million dollar

14:26.799 --> 14:28.366
research-and-development fund

14:28.367 --> 14:30.368
with ties going back to
World War II

14:30.369 --> 14:31.669
and the Third Reich.

14:31.670 --> 14:35.037
They don't list the last part
in their annual stock report.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.876
This is Jeroen Schiller.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.437
He's one of Hensel's
leading biotech engineers.

14:40.512 --> 14:41.946
He lives in Berlin.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.507
We've been in communication
with him since August.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.245
The news is that Hensel
has perfected a vaccine

14:47.319 --> 14:48.753
against biological weapons.

14:48.754 --> 14:51.122
Schiller has access
to that information.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.290
He wants to make a trade.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.158
What does he want
in exchange?

14:54.159 --> 14:55.493
Safe passage
to the United States.

14:55.494 --> 14:56.828
He lives in Berlin.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.763
Why can't he just take a cab
to the airport?

14:58.764 --> 15:00.832
Germany's not the problem.
Hensel is.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.996
Anyone who has top-level
clearance is closely surveilled.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.870
Your job is to I.D. Schiller.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.431
Get him away from Hensel
and into the United States.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.008
What kind of extraction?

15:10.009 --> 15:12.143
Shipment.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.579
Hensel is upgrading their
intranet with fiber optics.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.080
You go in as a Rhine Com
network supervisor.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.616
Now, unfortunately,

15:18.617 --> 15:21.142
this is the last documented
photo of Schiller.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.848
University of Hamburg, 1975.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.757
We had tech do
an age-processing

15:25.758 --> 15:28.522
to give you some idea of what
he might look like today.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.895
You'll find it in there.

15:30.896 --> 15:33.331
Marshall, go.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.333
Right. Thank you.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.302
How is everyone?
Hello.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.503
Hope everyone's planning
on having

15:38.504 --> 15:40.505
an enjoyable
All Hallow's Eve.

15:40.506 --> 15:41.506
Marshall.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.707
Sorry.

15:42.708 --> 15:46.109
Okay,
this is pretty incredible.

15:46.178 --> 15:48.806
Business card.
Something you might hand out.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.782
For instance, "Hello, I'm
a Rhine Com network supervisor,"

15:51.850 --> 15:52.750
in German, of course,

15:52.751 --> 15:54.719
because English would
probably give you away.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.854
But the genius,
the achievement,

15:56.855 --> 15:59.355
is this.

15:59.391 --> 16:00.892
Even Sony would be like,

16:00.893 --> 16:03.487
"Whoa, Marshall,
pretty cool."

16:03.562 --> 16:05.330
What does it do?

16:05.331 --> 16:07.891
You place the card
on top of his computer monitor.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.801
There's
a tiny transmitter inside.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.669
This transmitter
will override the cpu

16:11.670 --> 16:14.138
and make the network think
that you are the sys admin...

16:14.139 --> 16:15.673
uh, the system administrator.

16:15.674 --> 16:16.941
- Wow.
- Oh, yeah.

16:16.942 --> 16:19.210
You'll manually override
the company's firewall.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.245
Then Schiller will transfer
the vaccine formula

16:21.246 --> 16:23.081
from his office
to a Canadian-served website.

16:23.082 --> 16:24.415
Then we'll get the password

16:24.416 --> 16:25.850
once Schiller's
on American soil.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.418
So I got your voice mail.

16:27.419 --> 16:29.554
Please don't feel obligated.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.956
No. I asked Diane.
We're coming.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.091
All of us.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.592
You don't have to wear
a costume.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.728
- You didn't need to say that.
- Good.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.229
Sydney.

16:39.465 --> 16:40.999
Could I have a minute?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh, of course.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.501
I'll see you at Op Tech.

16:45.404 --> 16:47.739
I, um...

16:47.740 --> 16:49.907
We were closing a deal
last Thursday.

16:49.908 --> 16:51.409
I just couldn't get away.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.910
You said that when you called.
It's fine.

16:53.912 --> 16:57.746
This is an especially busy
time for me, Sydney.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.118
There are six different cases
I'm overseeing.

17:00.119 --> 17:00.918
Mm-hmm.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.453
So until things slow down,

17:02.454 --> 17:05.320
we probably shouldn't make
any plans.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.891
I wasn't gonna pursue it.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.627
I just wanted to clarify.

17:10.628 --> 17:13.128
Good.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.487
Hey.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.792
This is Paul Kelvin.
Sydney Bristow.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.560
- I know your father.
- Really?

17:42.561 --> 17:43.928
I hear that a lot.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.430
We got to move fast.
I'm gonna jump in here.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.465
The CIA's been watching
Hensel Corp for years.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.300
They're not really creating
a vaccine, are they?

17:49.301 --> 17:51.997
Yes, but the U.S. Army
has been doing parallel research

17:52.104 --> 17:53.671
that we thought was years
ahead of the Germans

17:53.672 --> 17:54.872
until we got your intel.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.374
So what are we afraid of?

17:56.375 --> 17:57.975
Schiller and his team
have developed

17:57.976 --> 17:59.777
micro-encapsulated cytosines.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.180
They activate the immune cells
in your respiratory tract.

18:02.181 --> 18:03.414
Do you know anything
about this?

18:03.415 --> 18:04.782
A little. You?

18:04.783 --> 18:05.917
A little.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.716
Enough to know that SD-6
could sell this vaccine

18:08.787 --> 18:11.654
to a radical leader who
wants to protect his own people

18:11.723 --> 18:14.223
and start an all-out
biological war.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.061
What am I supposed to do
in Berlin?

18:17.062 --> 18:18.563
Instead of shipping Schiller,

18:18.564 --> 18:20.698
who we'll get out through
Bamberg, we'll ship Kelvin.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.900
He's already prepped
to impersonate Schiller.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.569
Based on available photographs,

18:24.570 --> 18:26.637
we think
he's a pretty good match.

18:26.638 --> 18:29.073
You'll make the switch
in the building's garage.

18:29.074 --> 18:30.775
You sure
you're up for this?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.977
I'm not looking forward to it.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.708
What about when Sloane wants you
to give him the vaccine?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.982
He'll give them
false information.

18:37.983 --> 18:39.650
Kelvin's got
a plane waiting.

18:39.651 --> 18:42.745
- I'll see you in Berlin.
- Okay.

18:56.201 --> 18:57.702
I've got to tell Dixon.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.470
No. Absolutely not.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.772
How do I make a double switch
invisible to my partner?

19:01.773 --> 19:02.773
He'll be there.

19:02.774 --> 19:03.808
You cannot tell him the truth.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.576
He might already know
who he's working for.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.512
- You don't know him.
- That's my point.

19:07.513 --> 19:10.013
But I do.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.908
You might be right
about Dixon,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.354
but you can't volunteer a man
for double-agent duty

19:16.355 --> 19:17.722
if he hasn't asked for it.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.991
His whole life,
his family.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.426
You'd be putting
all of that at risk.

19:22.427 --> 19:23.961
You.

19:23.962 --> 19:27.227
Is that a decision
that you want to make for him?

20:25.023 --> 20:27.523
I'm in.

20:28.427 --> 20:31.828
Copy that.
All's quiet out front.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.675
Herr Schiller?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.584
You are the agent?

21:05.564 --> 21:08.064
Dixon, I think someone
might be following me.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.468
Meet me at Einsetzung
instead of behind the building.

21:10.469 --> 21:11.636
Copy that.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.470
I'm starting the gas now.

21:14.539 --> 21:17.940
You'll have two minutes until
people regain consciousness.

22:16.468 --> 22:18.869
Dixon,
I'm on Koenig Strasse.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.204
I'm on my way.

22:34.486 --> 22:39.617
<i># You win the argument
at the end of every night #</i>

22:39.691 --> 22:41.425
<i># I never know
the perfect... #</i>

22:41.426 --> 22:43.060
When you asked me
to help you set up,

22:43.061 --> 22:45.229
you didn't say, "Will you help
me set up all day," did you?

22:45.230 --> 22:46.964
- We're almost done.
- Almost done?

22:46.965 --> 22:47.732
What's left to cover

22:47.733 --> 22:49.266
that we haven't already
covered with corn?

22:49.267 --> 22:51.792
I work with
a professional party planner.

22:51.903 --> 22:53.938
What's going on with work?
You always talk about work.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.439
You haven't even
mentioned it today.

22:59.244 --> 23:01.744
You want the truth?

23:02.347 --> 23:04.941
I wasn't working
on an SAT story

23:05.016 --> 23:06.917
when I bumped into you guys.

23:06.918 --> 23:08.619
There is no SAT story.

23:08.620 --> 23:11.282
I was trying to track down
a woman named Kate Jones.

23:11.356 --> 23:13.023
She was supposed to be
seated next to Danny

23:13.024 --> 23:14.525
on a flight
from Singapore to Hong Kong.

23:14.526 --> 23:15.726
You can't do this.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.161
What was Danny doing
on a flight to Hong Kong

23:17.162 --> 23:18.629
if Sydney was supposed to
meet him in Singapore?

23:18.630 --> 23:20.931
Kate Jones and Danny
were the only two people

23:20.932 --> 23:22.933
to miss that flight.
The only two.

23:22.934 --> 23:24.502
I was at the medical school

23:24.503 --> 23:26.737
because I thought that maybe
they'd have her name on file.

23:26.738 --> 23:29.206
There's too many things
about Danny's death

23:29.207 --> 23:31.707
that don't make any sense.
One of them is this woman.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.838
I looked up every Kate,
Kathy, Katherine,

23:34.913 --> 23:36.514
Kathleen Jones
in L.A. County.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.749
Plus I have a contact
at the airport who said...

23:38.750 --> 23:40.418
You can't do this.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.653
Nothing is gonna bring
Danny back.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.622
When Sydney finds out
what you've been up to,

23:44.623 --> 23:47.123
which you know she will...

23:47.959 --> 23:50.459
Just think about that.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.934
I want to see Mr. Sloane.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.597
Mr. Schiller, I've explained
this. Sloane is not here.

23:59.704 --> 24:02.106
Tell us the password
to the website...

24:02.107 --> 24:05.543
I only talk to Sloane.
That was the agreement.

24:05.610 --> 24:09.341
If you were who you say you are,
you would know that.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.816
Mr. Schiller, I swear to you.
Sloane is a liar.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.317
He has nothing to do
with the CIA.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.923
So you say
Sloane is a fraud?

24:18.924 --> 24:23.054
How do I know it's not you
who is the fraud?

24:25.730 --> 24:28.230
You don't.

24:30.702 --> 24:33.070
But you will.

24:35.073 --> 24:37.208
How fast can we get
a plane to Langley?

24:37.209 --> 24:37.875
Why?

24:37.876 --> 24:39.410
He wants proof we're CIA.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.011
I don't think
he's gonna believe us

24:41.012 --> 24:42.413
unless we walk him
through the front door.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.914
Hey, Vaughn, we're in.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.251
What's this?

24:47.252 --> 24:50.153
This is the main reason
we made the switch in Berlin.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.690
We had Kelvin give Sloane
access to a bogus website

24:52.691 --> 24:54.892
with just enough real
information about the vaccine

24:54.893 --> 24:56.627
to keep them occupied
for months.

24:56.628 --> 24:58.496
Is that really worth
risking a man's life?

24:58.497 --> 24:59.497
No, there's more.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.365
Once SD-6 downloads and runs
the bogus program,

25:01.366 --> 25:03.434
it'll give us a back door
into their computer systems.

25:03.435 --> 25:06.962
In other words, we have access
to their entire network?

25:07.072 --> 25:09.473
Files, contacts, accounts?

25:09.474 --> 25:12.341
This is a huge step
in shutting down SD-6.

25:12.410 --> 25:13.511
Nice.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.012
It was Agent Vaughn's idea.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.082
You look so surprised.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.316
No, I jus...

25:19.317 --> 25:20.551
Yes, it was my idea.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.152
Amazing idea.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.653
Thank you. I know.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.140
This is very exciting.

25:43.141 --> 25:45.641
Go tell Analysis.

25:49.314 --> 25:51.682
It's good
to finally meet you.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.051
Yes.
The travel was not so easy,

25:54.052 --> 25:55.719
Forgive me for being so...

25:55.720 --> 25:57.087
Oh, no, no.
Not at all.

25:57.088 --> 26:00.717
So, we have $200,000 in cash
waiting for you.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.259
Thank you.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.694
You're welcome.
It's yours.

26:03.695 --> 26:05.062
As soon as you tell us,

26:05.063 --> 26:07.264
and we confirm,
the location of the plant.

26:07.265 --> 26:09.199
Plant?

26:09.200 --> 26:10.467
Which plant?

26:10.468 --> 26:12.736
Where the prototypes
are being made.

26:12.737 --> 26:15.237
The vaccine inhaler.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.742
You do know
the location of the plant.

26:22.847 --> 26:27.614
You see, I did not get
information about any prototype.

26:27.686 --> 26:30.120
I was never privileged
to such information.

26:30.121 --> 26:32.851
I have reason to believe
you were.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.654
So why don't you think
about it?

26:35.727 --> 26:38.389
Why don't you think
about everything?

26:53.778 --> 26:54.979
How's Schiller?

26:54.980 --> 26:56.714
I want to talk to you
about your report.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.282
Is something wrong?

26:58.283 --> 27:00.050
You wrote that
Sydney changed the pickup

27:00.051 --> 27:01.785
from Einsetzung
to the rear exit.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.287
I met them
on Koenig Strasse.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.456
Was this decided upon
before the extraction?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.257
- During.
- Why?

27:07.258 --> 27:09.159
She thought
someone was following her.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.995
Did you see
someone following her?

27:10.996 --> 27:14.261
No, but I was outside
the whole time.

27:14.332 --> 27:16.832
I see.

27:18.570 --> 27:21.266
If Sydney said there was
someone following her,

27:21.373 --> 27:23.873
there was someone
following her.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.320
Hey, Kenny.

27:43.061 --> 27:44.395
Trick or treat!

27:44.396 --> 27:46.463
There's more candy in there.

27:46.464 --> 27:47.131
Come on in.

27:47.132 --> 27:49.566
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

27:49.567 --> 27:52.067
Syd, can I talk to you
for a second?

28:00.011 --> 28:02.511
What's up?

28:02.881 --> 28:06.476
Syd, we've been working together
a lot of years.

28:06.551 --> 28:09.051
I trust you.

28:09.287 --> 28:11.689
- I trust you and I love you.
- I know.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.390
If something's up,
you'd tell me?

28:13.391 --> 28:14.958
What are you
talking about?

28:14.959 --> 28:16.527
Sloane is asking
about Berlin.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.562
He thinks someone might have
gotten to Schiller.

28:18.563 --> 28:19.997
He thinks he might be
a plant.

28:19.998 --> 28:22.166
He wanted to know why
you had me change the pickup

28:22.167 --> 28:23.233
to Koenig Strasse.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.734
I told you I thought
I was being followed.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.272
Syd...

28:28.273 --> 28:30.773
is there something
I should know?

28:34.446 --> 28:36.946
No.

28:38.850 --> 28:41.876
Sloane says
there's a prototype.

28:41.953 --> 28:43.754
An inhaler for the vaccine.

28:43.755 --> 28:44.688
He wants us to go get it,

28:44.689 --> 28:46.724
but Schiller won't give up
the location,

28:46.725 --> 28:47.925
which makes no sense.

28:47.926 --> 28:49.727
That man should know
where it is

28:49.728 --> 28:52.162
and has everything to lose
by not telling us.

28:52.163 --> 28:54.598
What's gonna happen to him?

28:54.599 --> 28:57.099
I think Schiller's in trouble.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.069
But, Syd...

29:00.138 --> 29:02.638
I think you are, too.

29:09.114 --> 29:11.878
<i># I was just an ordinary guy
hangin' round #</i>

29:11.950 --> 29:16.410
<i># That's when I got approached
by a hoochie woman #</i>

29:16.488 --> 29:18.689
Here's my question.
Who eats this crap?

29:18.690 --> 29:20.724
It's like marzipan,
but it's worse.

29:20.725 --> 29:22.526
If it's a question
between this or dirt,

29:22.527 --> 29:23.727
I would be all over
the dirt.

29:23.728 --> 29:25.696
Would you shut up
about the candy corn?

29:25.697 --> 29:26.930
Okay.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.399
You're bummed the kid came
and Charlie didn't.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.667
- Shh.
- What?

29:30.668 --> 29:32.970
You gave me some advice.
I took it.

29:32.971 --> 29:34.438
Now it's my turn
to give you some.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.907
- What advice did I give you?
- About the Kate Jones thing.

29:36.908 --> 29:38.642
I'm giving it up.
You're right.

29:38.643 --> 29:39.977
It can only end badly.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.279
So it's my turn
to give you some.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.840
You love Charlie.
You don't want to lose him.

29:44.916 --> 29:47.783
So don't be an idiot, okay?
You gotta talk to him.

29:47.852 --> 29:51.185
Don't deny it. Don't wait.
Don't piss me off.

29:51.256 --> 29:54.623
That's exactly what I did
when I first met Sydney.

29:54.692 --> 29:58.025
Use me as a cautionary tale
and call Charlie.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.605
Yeah. Will Tippin.

30:08.606 --> 30:12.633
Hi. This is Kate Jones.
You called me?

30:12.744 --> 30:14.845
Yeah, um...

30:14.846 --> 30:17.346
Did you know a guy
named Daniel Hecht?

30:18.183 --> 30:21.482
Yes, I did. Very well.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.720
You can't go to Langley.

30:23.721 --> 30:25.322
What? The plane leaves
in an hour.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.848
Kelvin could be dead by then.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.827
Sloane's looking for more
than the password.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.029
Information
Schiller would have.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.897
I mean, this could be it.

30:33.898 --> 30:36.398
If this goes badly,
they'll know I'm a double.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.235
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

30:38.236 --> 30:40.736
That's why I came here.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.935
I need to talk to Schiller
right now.

30:56.621 --> 30:58.922
I wouldn't have called
unless I had no choice.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.924
It's all right.
What is it?

31:00.925 --> 31:03.160
There's a CIA officer
named Paul Kelvin.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.429
Yes, I know about Berlin.
Paul's a friend.

31:05.430 --> 31:07.930
Then you should know
his life's in danger.

31:07.966 --> 31:09.199
He's in custody.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.700
Sloane wants intel
Kelvin doesn't have.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.071
I have the information
Kelvin needs,

31:14.072 --> 31:15.372
but I can't get it to him.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.608
Sloane's already
too suspicious of me.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.409
But since he trusts you...

31:19.410 --> 31:22.208
Sloane put a call in to me.
That must be why.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.314
Why would he call you?

31:24.315 --> 31:28.411
He finds me useful
in difficult situations.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.589
I'm surprised
you're not home with Emily.

31:32.590 --> 31:36.686
I would be...
but we have a problem.

31:36.761 --> 31:38.061
Oh?

31:38.062 --> 31:40.562
Schiller won't talk.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.701
I don't trust that man...

31:44.702 --> 31:47.637
so I want proof.

31:47.705 --> 31:48.705
Proof?

31:48.706 --> 31:51.206
That he's telling us
everything.

31:51.943 --> 31:54.912
That he is
who he says he is.

31:56.381 --> 31:58.881
I understand.

32:14.565 --> 32:17.659
Arvin Sloane is not affiliated

32:17.735 --> 32:20.829
with the United States
government.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.533
He is just a man...

32:23.641 --> 32:26.141
who used me...

32:26.177 --> 32:29.078
the same as he was gonna
use you.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.967
He made me think

32:49.968 --> 32:53.335
I was giving myself
to God and country,

32:53.438 --> 32:56.737
but it was all a lie.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.073
A lie that cost my fianc√©
his life.

33:03.948 --> 33:05.949
If I go back to SD-6

33:05.950 --> 33:09.408
without the location
of that plant,

33:09.487 --> 33:13.082
they will take the life
of another innocent man.

33:15.259 --> 33:17.494
I need to prove
you're Schiller and I'm SD-6.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.995
Paul, I have to hurt you.

33:20.498 --> 33:23.956
There's only one person
who can stop that.

33:24.035 --> 33:26.765
I'm talking to him right now.

33:27.905 --> 33:30.405
Mr. Schiller...

33:33.344 --> 33:35.844
Please.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.950
It's Badenweiler.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.258
The plant is
in Badenweiler.

33:48.259 --> 33:49.960
The plant is located
in Badenweiler

33:49.961 --> 33:52.362
near the black forest.

33:54.332 --> 33:57.392
Badenweiler!
It's in Badenweiler!

34:09.179 --> 34:11.313
<i>Sloane called us in
this morning.</i>

34:11.315 --> 34:13.875
<i>Our mission is to go
to Badenweiler tonight,</i>

34:13.951 --> 34:17.681
<i>steal the vaccine inhalers,
and blow up the plant.</i>

34:17.755 --> 34:19.755
<i>I don't know how much longer
I can do this.</i>

34:19.757 --> 34:22.192
<i>Sit in these meetings
with Sloane.</i>

34:22.193 --> 34:24.327
<i>Look at him
as if I don't despise him.</i>

34:24.328 --> 34:26.563
<i>As if I don't want to leap
across the table</i>

34:26.563 --> 34:30.431
<i>and use the skills I've learned
at SD-6 against him.</i>

34:30.501 --> 34:33.001
<i>So what the hell
do I do next?</i>

34:33.103 --> 34:35.603
<i>What's my countermission?</i>

34:48.518 --> 34:51.612
- He practically apologized.
- Sloane did?

34:51.688 --> 34:53.356
For thinking maybe
I'd mailed him the wrong guy.

34:53.357 --> 34:54.357
Imagine that.

34:54.358 --> 34:56.193
And your reward
for a job well done

34:56.194 --> 34:58.261
is destroying
the Badenweiler plant?

34:58.262 --> 34:59.729
Sloane says
Hensel's producing supplies

34:59.730 --> 35:01.331
for a neo-Nazi
terrorist faction.

35:01.332 --> 35:04.460
That is such a load.
Sloane wants the vaccine tech.

35:04.535 --> 35:07.504
Why? He thinks he has
the formula already.

35:07.572 --> 35:10.072
It took Hensel five years
to go from formula to prototype.

35:10.174 --> 35:12.674
Sloane wants to skip
that step.

35:14.245 --> 35:15.579
How's Kelvin?

35:15.580 --> 35:17.747
Home with his family.
Arm in a cast.

35:17.748 --> 35:20.183
He'll be fine.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.351
What about Schiller?

35:21.352 --> 35:23.220
On his way
to the Midwest somewhere

35:23.221 --> 35:25.388
with 200 grand of Sloane's money
in his pocket.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.457
Of all of us,
I'd say he's the luckiest.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.525
That's for sure.

35:28.526 --> 35:30.594
What's my counter?

35:30.595 --> 35:33.063
All right, you'll break into
the building as planned.

35:33.064 --> 35:36.192
While Dixon sets the explosives,
you'll retrieve the inhaler

35:36.267 --> 35:37.634
and rendezvous
with the CIA team,

35:37.635 --> 35:39.603
which will already be
inside the building.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.338
They will switch the inhaler.

35:41.339 --> 35:43.864
By this time, Dixon should
have exited the building.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.637
You'll disable the explosive
while the CIA team

35:46.711 --> 35:48.845
searches the rest of the lab's
main computer system.

35:48.846 --> 35:51.081
You're just gonna
steal their files?

35:51.082 --> 35:52.749
This isn't sanctioned research.

35:52.750 --> 35:55.152
Langley wants to know
what else Hensel's up to.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.454
So I get out
with the switched inhalers,

35:57.455 --> 35:59.256
Dixon tries
to blow the charge.

35:59.257 --> 36:00.023
Nothing happens.

36:00.024 --> 36:01.625
By that time,
security's on their way,

36:01.626 --> 36:02.692
and we can't get back in.

36:02.693 --> 36:05.193
That's the plan.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.499
You all right?

36:12.069 --> 36:15.004
What do you know
about case 332L?

36:21.145 --> 36:24.672
There's some missing pages
in my father's personnel file

36:24.749 --> 36:28.116
and references
to case 332L.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.187
And Agent Calder.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.189
You read that, too.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.455
Yeah. Actually,
it sparked my curiosity, too.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.327
I went to records
to retrieve the case file,

36:37.328 --> 36:38.428
but it was missing.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.929
There's no record of it
anywhere.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.366
There's one more thing.

36:44.835 --> 36:47.633
Calder wasn't CIA.
He was FBI.

36:50.074 --> 36:52.574
Why would the FBI be working
with my father?

36:52.577 --> 36:55.077
They wouldn't.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.551
Unless they suspected him
of selling secrets.

37:11.762 --> 37:12.596
Yeah, I know.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.532
I'm going to the Hancock Park
Homeowners' Association meeting.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.400
No, after county records.
Yeah.

37:17.401 --> 37:19.035
Wait. I'm on my cell.
I can't...

37:19.036 --> 37:20.704
You're breaking up,

37:20.705 --> 37:23.299
so I can't hear...

37:26.277 --> 37:27.777
Yeah. Will Tippin.

37:27.778 --> 37:29.779
Hey, Scourza.
What's up, man?

37:29.780 --> 37:31.548
Um...

37:31.549 --> 37:34.049
No, I didn't get a fax.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.987
Are you sure
it was Kate Jones?

37:36.988 --> 37:39.389
Yeah.
Where was she headed?

37:39.390 --> 37:41.324
Sao Paulo?

37:41.325 --> 37:42.726
Her Social Security number?

37:42.727 --> 37:45.227
Yeah. Give me
her Social Security number.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.098
What?

38:07.184 --> 38:09.684
Let's go.

39:10.147 --> 39:11.548
I'm going for the inhaler.

39:11.549 --> 39:13.450
I'll see you outside in 10.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.900
- Mr. Tippin?
- Yes?

39:31.969 --> 39:34.469
I'm Kate Jones.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.290
Forgive me if I ask you
anything too intrusive.

40:37.368 --> 40:38.735
It's just my job.

40:38.736 --> 40:39.903
It's okay.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.471
Can you start by telling me

40:41.472 --> 40:44.373
what your relationship was
with Daniel Hecht?

40:46.911 --> 40:49.411
Miss Jones?

40:50.581 --> 40:53.081
Danny and I were having
an affair.

41:00.324 --> 41:01.458
Sorry I'm late.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.959
Not at all.
Let's see what you got.

41:04.929 --> 41:05.929
These are 45s?

41:05.930 --> 41:07.831
I need three of them.

41:07.832 --> 41:09.365
So you're Bristow?

41:09.366 --> 41:11.334
- Yeah.
- Vaughn's told me about you.

41:11.335 --> 41:12.936
- He likes you.
- Yeah?

41:12.937 --> 41:15.437
Respects you.

41:19.376 --> 41:21.678
I've got a bomb
to disengage.

41:21.679 --> 41:23.012
Yeah, please.
We'd appreciate it.

41:23.013 --> 41:25.513
We'll be about 10 more minutes.
Good luck.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.648
I had twisted my ankle and
went to University Hospital.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.985
Danny treated me,
and he asked me out.

41:34.058 --> 41:35.658
Danny asked you out?

41:35.659 --> 41:36.759
Yeah.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.294
I knew that
he had been seeing someone,

41:38.295 --> 41:41.628
but I wasn't really thinking
so much about her.

41:53.878 --> 41:56.378
Syd, come on.

42:10.561 --> 42:13.394
We had talked about
going to Hong Kong together,

42:13.464 --> 42:16.433
but at the last minute,
he just broke it off.

42:18.168 --> 42:21.160
That's all it was, really.

42:21.238 --> 42:23.039
I guess it was
one of those relationships

42:23.040 --> 42:25.074
that just kind of happen
until they don't.

42:25.075 --> 42:27.575
I see.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.385
Is there anything else
that you want to know?

42:35.386 --> 42:39.083
Yeah, actually,
there is one more thing.

42:39.156 --> 42:42.091
I have a contact
who tracked your credit card

42:42.159 --> 42:44.627
from another one of your flights
out of L.A.X.

42:44.628 --> 42:47.256
From that, they got
your Social Security number.

42:47.331 --> 42:49.032
I did a trace on it.

42:49.033 --> 42:51.533
Here's what doesn't
make any sense.

42:52.436 --> 42:55.166
Kate Jones...

42:55.272 --> 42:58.332
you died in 1973.

43:02.346 --> 43:04.314
I have to go.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.549
Who are you?

43:06.550 --> 43:08.217
Who the hell are you?

43:11.221 --> 43:11.988
Got them.

43:11.989 --> 43:13.256
Is everyone
out of the building?

43:13.257 --> 43:14.290
We're good.

43:26.704 --> 43:29.400
Come on.
We got to go.

43:29.506 --> 43:31.841
Dixon, we don't have time
to go back.

43:31.842 --> 43:33.643
Dixon, what are you doing?

43:33.644 --> 43:35.712
I brought
a secondary detonator

43:35.713 --> 43:38.739
in case there was a frequency
jam like in Peru, remember?

43:39.483 --> 43:41.983
Did you get the inhalers?

43:43.721 --> 43:44.954
You good to go?

43:53.897 --> 43:56.397
All right. Let's go.

44:00.337 --> 44:01.971
Sydney?

44:01.972 --> 44:04.472
We've got to run.

44:05.943 --> 44:09.276
Sydney,
we've got to move now!

44:09.346 --> 44:11.846
Sydney!
