"Proper prisoner behavior"

00:33.067 --> 00:36.101
"consists fundamentally
of the following..."

00:36.103 --> 00:42.508
"freedom from self injury,
absence of un-hygienic acts,"

00:42.510 --> 00:49.381
"significant decrease in...
Problematic behaviors,"

00:49.383 --> 00:55.054
"motivation... To change..."

00:58.425 --> 01:02.628
"...Absence...

01:02.630 --> 01:06.799
Of destructive... Behaviors."

01:11.505 --> 01:16.208
"Decrease
in problematic behaviors.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.811
Motivation to change."

01:18.813 --> 01:20.179
What are you doing?

01:20.181 --> 01:24.216
"Absence
in destructive behaviors."

01:26.853 --> 01:29.588
"Decrease
in problematic behaviors"!

01:29.590 --> 01:32.357
"Absence
in destructive behaviors"!

01:32.359 --> 01:35.327
"Decrease
in problematic behaviors"!

01:35.329 --> 01:38.163
"Motivation to change"!

01:38.165 --> 01:40.866
Whoo!
"motivation to change"!

01:40.868 --> 01:42.668
Whoo!
To change!

01:42.670 --> 01:44.269
To change!

01:44.271 --> 01:47.706
to change!

01:52.112 --> 01:54.880
That smells nice.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.382
It's lavender.
I got the organic.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.684
No preservatives...

01:58.686 --> 02:01.787
Unlike melton's turtle.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.657
Had to be there.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.292
I just love these.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.395
I used to have a pair
just like them.

02:10.396 --> 02:11.797
Is that garnet hill?

02:11.799 --> 02:13.799
Um, saddle bridge.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.401
It's cute.
Why'd you stop wearing them?

02:16.403 --> 02:18.537
Guess I didn't want
to stand out.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.539
In a pair of clogs?

02:20.541 --> 02:23.375
In anything, really.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.615
I'm gonna pretend

02:29.617 --> 02:31.683
You're not in here
past visiting hours again.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.253
Sweet marla, my co-conspirator.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.855
I'll check back in a bit.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.590
Everybody's been so nice here.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.526
It's because we're not
in paulie, mother.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.561
You'll notice a difference
in tone sometimes

02:42.563 --> 02:44.363
When people don't wish
you were dead.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.298
That's pleasant.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.533
Just saying.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.636
I better get on the road, then.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.205
Thank you for keeping watch,
amantha.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.773
I know the drive is a bear.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.708
It's what we do.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.477
I am my brother's keeper.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.412
It won't be forever, honey.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.714
Then what will I do?
Get a job?

03:02.716 --> 03:05.517
I can't even think
about a job right now.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.786
Gonna have to sooner or later.

03:07.788 --> 03:08.820
How about later?

03:10.925 --> 03:12.324
Mama, don't forget your catalog.

03:18.898 --> 03:21.400
He's not a china doll.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.634
What?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.570
You're not gonna break him.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.408
God, mama.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.910
What are we gonna do?

03:31.912 --> 03:34.246
What we've been doing.

03:34.248 --> 03:37.449
Stay positive.
Keep hoping.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.418
Keep hoping.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.889
Good night, my sweethearts.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.472
I'm telling you, dad,
we're gonna drag ass on this,

04:33.474 --> 04:36.008
And we're gonna miss the best
opportunity we've had in years.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.342
Wheel rims.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.577
Specialization, dad.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.445
It's where retail's going.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.748
And we got to get out
in front of it.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.650
Where'd you get that idea?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.652
I've been working on it
for a while now.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.321
It's all they could talk about
at the tire conference.

04:49.323 --> 04:52.991
We sell tires, son.
Sell... not rent.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.495
People today...
they want flash, you know?

04:56.497 --> 04:58.463
They... they...
they want bling.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.731
They want stuff they can afford.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.400
Fair enough, okay?

05:01.402 --> 05:03.335
But they can afford to rent
high-quality wheel rims

05:03.337 --> 05:04.770
At an affordable weekly fee.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.905
And they'll rent them
by the truckloads.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.674
That's all that matters to me.

05:08.676 --> 05:09.875
Hmm.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.980
Dad, the numbers don't lie.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.917
Three straight months
of declining sales.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.886
Hey, whoa, whoa. We got
to microwave this thing.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.487
We ain't got time
for an oven bake.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.356
The microwave makes it mushy.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.591
Yeah, I know.
It's got the, uh, little
reflectors built into it.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.826
It gives it
that oven-baked flavor.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.428
Just make the salad.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.101
Listen.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.803
I know a lot of things are up
in the air right now.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.404
A lot of things?

05:39.406 --> 05:41.506
We need a new revenue stream,
and we need it quick.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.709
And this is it.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.610
Where's the cheese and tomatoes?

05:45.612 --> 05:46.978
What's it cost?

05:48.815 --> 05:51.450
Well, you got to spend money
to make money.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.951
What's the investment, ted?

05:52.953 --> 05:55.554
I'm still working
on the final numbers...

05:55.556 --> 05:59.658
But no more than 40k, 50k, tops.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.959
$50,000?

06:00.961 --> 06:02.894
Tops, dad.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.831
Where's the spatula?

06:05.833 --> 06:08.233
I don't know.
Use that cake thing.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.211
You got to trust me
on this, dad.

06:14.907 --> 06:19.444
I don't see it, son.
Not right now.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.555
Well... There's something else
we ain't talked about

06:30.557 --> 06:33.037
That ain't nobody
wanted to talk about.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.161
What if daniel wakes up
out of this coma,

06:36.163 --> 06:38.096
And he's a damn
veggie burger?
Easy, ted.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.765
I ain't trying to be crass, dad,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.600
But what if mom's
got to wipe his ass

06:41.602 --> 06:42.634
For the next 20 years?

06:42.636 --> 06:44.102
What are y'all arguing about?

06:46.105 --> 06:49.608
We're just having
a conversation, son.

06:49.610 --> 06:53.044
I'll be in my room.

06:59.952 --> 07:04.122
¶ Breathless and on ¶

07:04.124 --> 07:06.158
¶ again ¶

07:11.030 --> 07:13.899
¶ inside ¶

07:15.802 --> 07:19.905
¶ today ¶

07:23.777 --> 07:27.612
<i> This is your special</i>
<i>mix tape, daniel holden.</i>

07:27.614 --> 07:28.814
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

07:28.816 --> 07:30.449
<i>I love you, daniel.</i>

07:32.519 --> 07:35.053
<i>...Your special mix tape,</i>
<i>daniel holden.</i>

07:35.055 --> 07:36.655
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

07:36.657 --> 07:38.457
<i>I love you, daniel.</i>

07:39.526 --> 07:41.460
<i>I love you, daniel.</i>

07:42.596 --> 07:44.629
<i>I love you, daniel.</i>

07:48.801 --> 07:51.636
Damn, j.
Why so jumpy?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.672
Some people knock.

07:53.674 --> 07:58.176
Oh, right.
I forget you're at that age.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.812
I just came to tell you
dinner's ready.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.981
All right.
I'll be down in a bit.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.017
What is that, a walkman?

08:06.019 --> 08:08.753
Where the hell
did you find that?

08:08.755 --> 08:10.522
I found it in the attic.

08:17.196 --> 08:18.830
Hey, where's the, uh...?

08:18.832 --> 08:21.700
Where's that faith hill poster
I got for your birthday?

08:21.702 --> 08:23.034
I just...
I don't know.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.003
I'm not really into that
right now.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.538
Sorry, teddy.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.772
No, that's all right.
I'm just messing with you.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.074
I get it.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.042
Everybody has their
alternative phase.

08:33.113 --> 08:36.815
That feels like
four pounds of boredom.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.217
I always hated algebra.

08:39.219 --> 08:42.587
How's school treating you?

08:42.589 --> 08:44.289
It's okay, I guess.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.991
How about those texts...

08:45.993 --> 08:48.627
The, uh, threats
and all that stuff?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.228
No, not since daniel's
been in the hospital.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.632
I guess even scumbags
can grow a conscience

08:53.634 --> 08:55.300
Every now and then, huh?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.738
Listen, I'm glad

08:59.740 --> 09:03.108
You can, you know, go to dad
with that kind of thing.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.144
Yeah. Me, too.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.247
You know, he saved
the store back then.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.183
Dad?
Oh, yeah.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.920
Place was a ghost town
after all that mess.

09:14.922 --> 09:18.723
You know, lester,
he... Damn near went bankrupt,

09:18.725 --> 09:21.159
And then he just up and died.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.896
And I ain't trying to speak ill
of the man, you know,

09:24.898 --> 09:27.866
It's just that
he was a holden, you know?

09:27.868 --> 09:30.802
Name was ruined.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.338
Wasn't nothing
he could do about it.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.678
Go get some dinner,
little brother.

09:43.182 --> 09:46.785
Few things I love more
than a clear, cool night...

09:46.787 --> 09:49.154
Sitting out here with my girls.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.256
We should have
life group outside every week.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.791
Amen to that.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.193
As long as there's red wine.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.293
Right?
And no kids.

09:56.863 --> 10:00.165
What about you, tawney?
What do you think?

10:00.167 --> 10:02.033
You've been awfully quiet
tonight.

10:02.035 --> 10:06.905
I think god reveals himself
in nature,

10:06.907 --> 10:08.773
And it's beautiful.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.343
Well, that's
a pretty thought.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.244
Thomas aquinas said that,
not me.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.080
I didn't know you read aquinas.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.382
Didn't know
anybody read aquinas.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.050
Look at you, smarty pants.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.619
I'm just learning, really.

10:20.621 --> 10:21.786
ohh.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.188
A friend told me about him.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.658
Ooh. Smart friend.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.827
My brother-in-law, actually.

10:32.031 --> 10:35.166
I'm sorry, tawney,
I got to say something.

10:35.168 --> 10:38.069
I've been waiting
for the right moment

10:38.071 --> 10:40.105
Or the right... Mood

10:40.107 --> 10:47.012
Or... The right whatever,
but it just ain't coming.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.148
I judged him back then,

10:50.150 --> 10:53.018
And I've been judging him
all these years.

10:53.020 --> 10:58.289
And then he got out and
you brought him to the jubilee

10:58.291 --> 11:01.426
And it made me have
to face a lot of that...

11:01.428 --> 11:05.997
That judgment...
how kind you were to him,

11:05.999 --> 11:09.234
How selfless,

11:09.236 --> 11:13.405
How you loved him
like Jesus would.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.243
Uh, I don't know about that.
I...

11:18.245 --> 11:20.145
It's true.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.814
All these years, you know,

11:22.816 --> 11:26.818
I-I thought he did
all those terrible things.

11:26.820 --> 11:30.021
I guess maybe a part of me
still does.

11:30.023 --> 11:35.393
But even if he did,
who am I to judge?

11:35.395 --> 11:38.463
'Cause the truth is,
I don't even know him.

11:40.299 --> 11:44.135
Sometimes I wonder if we can
truly know anyone completely,

11:44.137 --> 11:47.906
Even ourselves.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.475
But thank you, kate.

11:50.477 --> 11:54.245
That's brave to say that.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.382
Walk with god
or walk in fear, right?

11:59.019 --> 12:02.087
Easier said than done. I know.
But I'm trying.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.155
Aren't we all?

12:26.479 --> 12:27.846
Hey.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.013
Hey.

12:29.015 --> 12:31.182
You didn't answer your phone.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.318
I had the ringer turned off.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.420
I called like seven times.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.921
Seven? Really?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.457
Why didn't you just call
the office phone?

12:39.459 --> 12:41.826
Well, why do you have
your ringer off?

12:41.828 --> 12:43.428
I was just trying to focus.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.497
I-I didn't know
you'd be calling.

12:45.499 --> 12:49.000
I just... I thought
you might be hungry.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.936
Oh, that lasagna filled me up
pretty good at dad's.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.107
I-I'll just put this
on your desk.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.976
Oh, okay.
I-I-I got that.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.511
Thanks, babe.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.984
So, how's life group?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.787
Oh. Fine.
Fine.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.022
That's good.
That's good. That's good.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.525
A-are you
coming home soon?

13:15.961 --> 13:17.228
I-I don't know.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.397
I got to get this rim stuff
figured out.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.400
I might just end up staying here
and crashing here on the couch,

13:22.402 --> 13:25.537
You know... If that's okay.

13:25.539 --> 13:28.439
Well, won't... won't you be
all wrinkly in the morning

13:28.441 --> 13:29.541
If you do that?

13:29.543 --> 13:31.810
I brought a change of clothes.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.311
You brought a what?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.547
You know, just in case.

13:35.549 --> 13:39.083
Were you planning on staying
here when you left the house?

13:39.085 --> 13:40.451
I didn't plan on it.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.187
Uh, but, I mean,
I... it was just in case.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.555
In case what?

13:43.557 --> 13:46.057
In case I got tied up,
tawney, like I am.

13:46.059 --> 13:49.060
I mean, this is a big deal
I'm trying to put together.

13:49.062 --> 13:52.297
But it's a 10-minute
drive home.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.364
You want me to come home?

13:53.366 --> 13:54.899
That's fine.
Let's come home.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.835
I'll drop everything
and come home right now.

13:56.837 --> 13:57.969
No, I-I don't want you
to come home

13:57.971 --> 13:59.371
Unless you want to come home.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.239
Well, of course I want
to come home, tawney!

14:01.241 --> 14:04.008
I'd love nothing more than
to stay at home all damn day.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.176
You didn't want me to work, ted.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.611
I'm not talking about you.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.279
That was your idea.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.547
I mean in general.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.116
Tawney, staying home in general.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.990
This is the biggest thing
I've ever tried to do work-wise,

14:18.992 --> 14:21.426
All right,
so I'm a little stressed out.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.462
And dad... he's so dadgum
entrenched in his ways,

14:24.464 --> 14:27.265
You know, it makes me feel
like I'm trapped.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.547
I just want to scream.

14:30.269 --> 14:32.871
Can I... can I help?

14:32.873 --> 14:35.039
Help how?

14:35.041 --> 14:39.310
I don't know, you know,
bounce ideas off me,

14:39.312 --> 14:41.279
Or... or just talk.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.949
Well... We're talking now,
aren't we?

14:44.951 --> 14:48.620
I guess.

14:48.622 --> 14:51.122
I mean... I mean,
of course you could.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.058
I mean,
I'm... I'm sure you could.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.060
I just...

14:55.061 --> 14:56.261
I'm so deep in the numbers,

14:56.263 --> 14:57.662
You know, and the specs and all.

14:57.664 --> 15:01.065
I-I understand.

15:04.937 --> 15:08.106
Well, I'll... I'll let you
get back, then.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.909
I mean,
he's worried half to death.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.612
You know dad.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.614
Honey, you didn't tell me
the business was so...

15:16.616 --> 15:20.285
It ain't the business.
Come on, tawney.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.953
You know
there's a damn good chance

15:21.955 --> 15:23.655
That daniel's gonna wake up
out of this coma

15:23.657 --> 15:26.057
Slobbering and shitting
all over himself!

15:26.059 --> 15:28.159
Why do you talk like that?

15:28.161 --> 15:29.661
Because it's a damn good
possibility,

15:29.663 --> 15:32.230
And it's weighing on dad
and mom, too.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.531
I mean, do you want
to go over there

15:33.533 --> 15:34.933
And change his damn diapers
every day?

15:34.935 --> 15:38.136
And amantha... hell, the first
whiff of stink she gets,

15:38.138 --> 15:40.338
She's gonna be hauling her ass
back to atlanta so fast

15:40.340 --> 15:42.040
It'll make your head spin!

15:42.042 --> 15:45.009
You just watch!

15:49.982 --> 15:52.150
Do you still pray, ted?

15:52.152 --> 15:55.420
What?

15:55.422 --> 15:58.523
Do you still pray?

15:58.525 --> 16:01.025
Of course I do.

16:05.030 --> 16:08.366
Well, you don't pray
with me anymore.

16:45.304 --> 16:47.538
You're gonna be okay, danny.

16:47.540 --> 16:51.309
You're gonna be okay.

16:55.347 --> 16:59.684
Sweetheart, dr. Ackborn
has some news for us.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.387
I thought
we should hear it together.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.688
Okay.

17:12.564 --> 17:15.133
Well, there's no reason
to make you sweat it out.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.068
I think it's time
to wake up daniel.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.804
The tests and the scans
for the last 72 hours

17:19.806 --> 17:21.339
Have all been clear.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.607
Brain function is stable.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.308
Intercranial pressure is normal.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.777
Things look very positive.

17:25.779 --> 17:28.579
So... He's gonna be okay?

17:28.581 --> 17:30.782
We won't know for sure until
we pull him out, of course.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.683
You're not saying
he's gonna be okay.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.585
As we've discussed, there's a
few scenarios that could occur.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.320
Like the one where he never
regains consciousness.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.823
Well, that's a very small
possibility in my estimation.

17:38.825 --> 17:42.393
How small?
Please, amantha.
"small" is good.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.262
No, "small" is relative.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.297
Honestly, ms. Holden, I don't
think that worrying about this

17:46.299 --> 17:47.532
Is the best way
to use your energy.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.100
My energy?

17:49.102 --> 17:51.202
The scans are clear.
The tests are normal.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.336
This is very good news.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.639
Good news.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.841
Yeah.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.077
Of course.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.311
Good news for sure.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.413
We'll get started
as soon as possible,

18:02.415 --> 18:04.415
Try to wean him off the vent.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.684
If all goes well, I suspect...

18:06.686 --> 18:08.186
He'll be waking up
sometime this evening

18:08.188 --> 18:10.788
Or tomorrow at the latest.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.324
Okay?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.086
Okay.
Let me get to it.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.668
Well, well, mr. Holden,

18:23.670 --> 18:26.771
Time to bring you back
to the land of the living.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.508
I hope you're ready for it
'cause it's a shit show.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.370
Ohh!

19:28.634 --> 19:29.934
If I didn't know any better,

19:29.936 --> 19:31.769
I'd think you almost want
to get caught.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.707
You know,
we've been doing our part...

19:36.709 --> 19:39.343
Laying low, keeping
our distance, as agreed.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.447
Then there's you, bobby...
our fearless leader.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.218
Everybody knows
it's the guilty man

19:47.220 --> 19:48.853
Who tries to drink away
his sorrows.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.323
Well, I guess
it ain't working, jake,

19:52.325 --> 19:53.691
'cause I still got 'em.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.561
You know, what kind of
a punk-ass asks his buddies

19:56.563 --> 19:58.362
To beat a man half to death,

19:58.364 --> 20:01.465
Then takes his mask off so
the dude can get a good look?

20:01.467 --> 20:03.768
I ain't gonna rat on you.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.304
No, see, you already did.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.806
What do you think holden's
gonna say when he wakes up?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.975
if he wakes up.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.244
What's he gonna say, bobby?

20:16.515 --> 20:18.749
Maybe he'll say "ow."

20:18.751 --> 20:20.451
This ain't a joke.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.655
He might say,
"I got what was coming to me."

20:26.825 --> 20:28.559
Y'all still believe that,
don't you?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.294
Of course we do.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.296
That don't mean we want to
go to jail for it, though.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.931
I said I ain't gonna rat on you.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.667
Sheriff's been by my house
three times already.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.402
He said he's fixing
to arrest all of us.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.871
Why hasn't he yet, hmm?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.974
'Cause he ain't got no evidence,
that's why.

20:42.976 --> 20:45.343
He's got no witnesses.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.545
He... he ain't got dick.

20:47.547 --> 20:48.946
Except holden.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.822
Nobody's going to jail.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.524
You're pretty confident
for a drunk damn dumb-ass.

21:00.526 --> 21:02.627
Oh, that's good, craig.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.894
Alliteration.

21:03.896 --> 21:07.331
Huh?
"drunk damn dumb-ass."

21:07.333 --> 21:09.367
It's called alliteration.

21:17.342 --> 21:22.513
You get your head right, bobby,
or I'll set you up my damn self.

21:34.326 --> 21:35.660
Hi.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.622
Good night, darrell.
Good night.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.321
How many times, sheriff?

22:03.323 --> 22:06.557
As many as it takes,
ms. Wages.

22:06.559 --> 22:10.027
Stevie didn't see anything
at that cemetery.

22:10.029 --> 22:13.831
It's like I told you.
He was just too far away.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.600
Then let me talk to him.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.402
What do you have to fear?

22:20.105 --> 22:22.973
I wish I didn't have to
ask this of you, ms. Wages,

22:22.975 --> 22:24.108
Or put you in this position.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.609
I really don't.

22:25.611 --> 22:28.512
But a man has been beaten
nearly to death.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.348
What if it was stevie
in that I.C.U.?

22:30.350 --> 22:32.016
Stevie's not
a convicted murderer.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.118
Neither is holden.
Sentence was vacated.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.821
Now, you tell that to judy dean.

22:36.823 --> 22:39.123
I'm sorry, ma'am,

22:39.125 --> 22:41.859
But this thing's
just really weighing on me.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.628
I know who did it,
and I know who helped him.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.698
But my hands are tied
until I get a witness.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.067
And what those boys
did to him...

22:50.069 --> 22:51.669
That's attempted murder.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.604
And if he dies, it's murder.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.406
And you can't just murder
people, debbie,

22:55.408 --> 22:57.641
No matter how much you might
believe they deserve it.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.746
That's why I'm here.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.468
And that's why
I'm asking for your help.

23:07.652 --> 23:10.054
I just can't do it, sheriff.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.847
Gave her a run,
didn't we, jonny?

24:42.849 --> 24:44.114
Don't hold back.

24:46.051 --> 24:49.053
Dna, man, it's a bitch.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.021
Only when you're guilty.

24:51.023 --> 24:54.225
Sorry to put a stain
on your portfolio.

24:54.227 --> 24:58.729
Look, man, I appreciate you
coming all the way out here.

24:58.731 --> 24:59.797
I do.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.766
But I don't want you to stay.

25:02.768 --> 25:04.969
I mean, not for the whole thing.

25:04.971 --> 25:08.239
I mean, I don't want nobody
seeing me going out like that.

25:08.241 --> 25:10.708
I can understand that, hollis.

25:10.710 --> 25:14.245
But it would be cool if
you'd come to the last meal.

25:14.247 --> 25:17.281
Yeah, the last meal
is usually just family.

25:17.283 --> 25:20.184
Ain't no family to come.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.020
My sister hates me now.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.989
My mom calls me a liar.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.725
She won't say I'm a murderer,
of course,

25:27.727 --> 25:31.729
But she... Calls me a liar.

25:33.765 --> 25:35.099
Typical.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.800
You still got
a couple days, though.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.802
Maybe she'll come around.

25:40.572 --> 25:43.607
you want me to call her?

25:43.609 --> 25:46.644
Waste of time, man.
Screw her.

25:46.646 --> 25:47.711
You know what?

25:47.713 --> 25:49.280
Just forget the whole thing,
jon.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.615
Go on home.
You don't want to be here.

25:51.617 --> 25:52.683
Hollis.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.184
Yeah?

25:54.186 --> 25:57.154
I'll stay.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.089
30 minutes is all.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.858
I'll stay as long as you like.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.727
Maybe 45.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.897
I guess I just don't want
to eat alone.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.934
I'm happy to stay.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.604
Don't think you can sneak me
in a burger, do you?

26:13.606 --> 26:16.073
Sonic burger
and some tater tots.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.908
And lots of tots.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.978
And hash browns.
Can you do that?

26:20.980 --> 26:23.781
Go... go
to different places?

26:23.783 --> 26:25.082
I'll have to check
with the warden.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.684
In some states,
you can order out. Some...

26:26.686 --> 26:30.921
Just make sure I get my potatoes
whatever you do.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.824
I just love potatoes, man.

26:33.826 --> 26:36.026
Must be the irish in me.

26:36.028 --> 26:39.096
Potatoes are from the new world.

26:39.098 --> 26:43.067
You learn something new
every day.

26:51.243 --> 26:54.345
Seems harmless, don't it?

26:54.347 --> 26:57.247
Dna?

26:57.249 --> 27:03.654
Can't hold it in your hands,
like it ain't even real.

27:03.656 --> 27:07.691
It was there all along,
waiting in the shadows,

27:07.693 --> 27:10.628
Just waiting to call me a liar.

27:10.630 --> 27:15.132
Just waiting like
a goddamn sleeping giant.

27:15.134 --> 27:19.069
But that's the thing about
sleeping giants, hollis.

27:21.940 --> 27:25.643
At some point,
they're gonna wake up.

27:40.892 --> 27:42.726
Dad called on the way over.

27:42.728 --> 27:44.895
Said they're waking up
daniel today.

27:44.897 --> 27:48.165
Well, that's...
that's great news, right?

27:48.167 --> 27:49.333
I mean...

27:49.335 --> 27:52.870
Do they know how...
how he'll be?

27:52.872 --> 27:57.041
Won't know for a few days,
he said.

28:02.947 --> 28:05.916
I can't stay.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.251
Got a meeting.

28:15.727 --> 28:18.829
You weren't crazy, ted.

28:30.842 --> 28:33.744
When you were suspicious...

28:33.746 --> 28:36.947
When you were angry at me
for spending time with him,

28:36.949 --> 28:38.115
You weren't crazy.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.917
Not that anything happened.

28:39.919 --> 28:42.986
It didn't, but...

28:42.988 --> 28:45.289
Like I told you,
I thought that...

28:45.291 --> 28:47.991
That god wanted to use me
to save him.

28:47.993 --> 28:49.460
And maybe he did.
I don't know.

28:49.462 --> 28:52.396
But that's what I felt then.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.167
It's hard...
it's hard to explain,

28:57.169 --> 29:00.771
But I-I promise I didn't think
I was leading him on.

29:00.773 --> 29:05.743
Were you...
Leading him on?

29:05.745 --> 29:08.178
Not on purpose.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.314
But it's like we...
we had a connection

29:10.316 --> 29:14.818
Or... Things in common.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.387
We have things in common.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.123
Of course we do.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.425
Not the same kind of things.

29:21.427 --> 29:25.929
It made sense to me
at the time, you know?

29:25.931 --> 29:30.501
Like god put him in my path
to help him.

29:30.503 --> 29:34.538
I think to bring some light
into all that darkness.

29:34.540 --> 29:38.041
Looking back, I can see

29:38.043 --> 29:42.913
Where I-I didn't try
to stop it.

29:42.915 --> 29:47.918
And I... and I didn't cut it off
and I let it grow and...

29:47.920 --> 29:50.254
And what?

29:50.256 --> 29:53.457
Daniel asked
if he could kiss me.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.893
What did you say?

29:55.895 --> 29:58.395
I said no, teddy.
Of course I did.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.831
So you two were alone together.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.567
Yeah.

30:03.569 --> 30:06.570
How many times?

30:08.173 --> 30:14.178
Um... Once at...
at the church, and then...

30:14.180 --> 30:17.481
And then again
after the jubilee.

30:17.483 --> 30:21.218
You said
you had a... Connection.

30:23.354 --> 30:26.256
That means
you had feelings, too?

30:26.258 --> 30:30.127
I thought god wanted me
to help him.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.495
A guy like that can't be helped.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.096
That's not true.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.264
I know things you don't.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.566
Like what?

30:35.568 --> 30:36.934
You didn't answer my question.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.302
It was all very confusing.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.504
Did you have feelings for him?

30:39.505 --> 30:40.938
I just...
I wanted to...

30:40.940 --> 30:42.472
Did you have feelings
for him, tawney?

30:42.474 --> 30:45.275
yes, I did. Okay?

30:46.911 --> 30:48.191
I had feelings for him.

30:51.416 --> 30:54.384
Had. But that...
that's why I'm telling you

30:54.386 --> 30:58.055
Because I-I don't want to have
those feelings again.

31:05.296 --> 31:07.264
Appreciate you telling me this.

31:10.168 --> 31:14.071
It's not exactly what
I wanted to hear, of course.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.205
Yeah, I know.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.575
I know, and I'm sorry.

31:22.580 --> 31:25.282
Ted, will you forgive me?

31:38.096 --> 31:40.397
Everything's gonna be all right.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.036
Trey willie.

32:19.038 --> 32:22.005
Ain't that a kick in the head?

32:22.007 --> 32:25.008
Long time
since I saw your ugly face.

32:25.010 --> 32:28.979
That's kind of why I wanted
to come by, actually.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.714
How's that?

32:30.716 --> 32:32.516
I've been calling georgie,

32:32.518 --> 32:35.252
Trying to catch up,
you know, and...

32:37.522 --> 32:39.556
Ain't heard from him.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.959
Trying to catch up, huh?

32:41.961 --> 32:45.529
It's been a while, you know?

32:48.266 --> 32:49.700
Can't help you there.

32:54.172 --> 32:56.173
And when did you talk
to him last?

32:56.175 --> 32:58.275
Long time.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.377
And why's that?

33:00.379 --> 33:02.579
What's it to you?

33:02.581 --> 33:07.184
Guess I'm... Just surprised
is all.

33:07.186 --> 33:10.287
Life's full of that, trey...
surprises.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.692
Called him a queer one time...

33:15.694 --> 33:17.561
Couple years back.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.563
Ain't seen him since.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.103
Probably not your finest moment.

33:26.105 --> 33:29.740
Probably you're right.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.044
You know daniel's out.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.712
Of course I know.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.148
How do you think georgie
feels about that?

33:38.150 --> 33:40.717
How do <i> you</i> feel about that?

33:40.719 --> 33:46.189
Weird as hell, if I'm honest.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.225
Killer walking these streets.

33:48.227 --> 33:51.128
Only maybe he ain't the killer.

33:52.497 --> 33:55.298
So they say.

33:55.300 --> 34:00.170
Think he'd ever call him...
georgie?

34:02.040 --> 34:05.509
You know, make amends.

34:05.511 --> 34:09.478
Doubt that.

34:11.416 --> 34:14.384
It was good to see you,
mr. Miller.

34:16.521 --> 34:20.357
one bad choice.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.195
One mistake.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.164
Sometimes that's all it takes.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.699
Mistakes can be fixed, sir.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.702
Believe that, do you?

34:36.774 --> 34:39.743
No.
Guess I don't.

34:41.846 --> 34:44.246
Hey.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.184
how is our friendly
neighborhood murderer?

34:47.186 --> 34:48.418
He loves potatoes.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.620
I can't believe that peckerhead.

34:50.621 --> 34:53.123
How much adjustment
on his defense?

34:53.125 --> 34:56.159
About $250,000, give or take.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.328
Son of a bitch.
People are the worst.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.397
Some are.

35:00.399 --> 35:03.366
Sometimes you get
so caught up in a cause,

35:03.368 --> 35:05.669
You...
you don't see the man.

35:05.671 --> 35:08.572
I'm sorry
they can't all be daniels.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.574
Yeah, me, too.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.210
Speaking of which, amantha,

35:13.212 --> 35:16.246
I'm sorry I won't be there
when he gets home.

35:18.116 --> 35:22.819
But you understand
why I have to stay, right?

35:22.821 --> 35:24.321
Or do you think
I should let this guy

35:24.323 --> 35:25.689
Spend his last day alone?

35:25.691 --> 35:27.791
I think he shouldn't have killed
that old lady.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.693
Then he wouldn't have
to worry about it.

35:29.695 --> 35:32.596
That's what I think, jon.

35:35.166 --> 35:38.301
I'm sorry.

35:38.303 --> 35:41.238
I know your life
is more than just daniel.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.341
At least daniel's
coming home, right?

35:44.343 --> 35:45.675
That's the hope.

35:45.677 --> 35:48.678
How does that make you feel?

35:48.680 --> 35:51.248
Ecstatic, of course.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.482
Good.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.251
Got to stay positive.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.285
Go, team.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.654
I'll be home soon.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.390
Home, jon?

36:00.392 --> 36:02.659
You know what I mean.

36:04.929 --> 36:07.697
He conned me.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.433
Hollis.

36:10.435 --> 36:12.502
All these years.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.472
No.
You wanted to help a man, jon.

36:15.474 --> 36:18.742
There's no fault in that,
only goodness.

36:18.744 --> 36:22.212
Call me when he wakes up.

36:22.214 --> 36:24.214
You know I will.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.652
I love you, jon.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.721
Love you, too, amantha.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.793
Talk soon, okay?

36:36.795 --> 36:39.663
Yeah. Later.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.843
Is one of them the man you saw?

37:01.652 --> 37:04.254
That's him?

37:04.256 --> 37:06.990
Yes, sir.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.526
Are you sure, son?

37:11.262 --> 37:13.296
Y-yes, sir.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.899
So what happened next, stevie,

37:15.901 --> 37:18.368
After he pulled off the mask?

37:21.339 --> 37:23.873
He peed on him.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.942
I see.

37:29.514 --> 37:34.251
Thank you, stevie.

37:37.321 --> 37:38.488
Thank you.

37:58.643 --> 38:01.011
Welcome back, danny boy.

38:01.013 --> 38:03.346
I've been missing you.

38:29.807 --> 38:33.310
You got motivation
to change now, dan?

38:33.312 --> 38:37.514
They took your precious books.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.349
Took your precious kerwin.

38:39.351 --> 38:43.787
Now all you got is me.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.523
You ain't going to sleep
on me now, are you?

38:46.525 --> 38:50.760
Oh, come on now.
I've been missing you, dan.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.395
Wake up, son!

38:52.397 --> 38:58.501
Wake u-u-u-u-u-u-up!

39:27.898 --> 39:30.367
Kerwin?

39:33.571 --> 39:36.740
Oh, god.
Are you okay?

39:40.811 --> 39:43.513
are you okay?

39:43.515 --> 39:44.781
So far, so good.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.616
Six hours and seven coffees.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.585
I just couldn't hold it anymore.

39:48.587 --> 39:50.687
probably a record.

39:50.689 --> 39:54.424
And now amantha's gone
to get food.

39:54.426 --> 39:55.692
We can't get anything right.

39:55.694 --> 39:57.460
We've been waiting on you
all day.

39:57.462 --> 39:59.496
It's okay.

39:59.498 --> 40:03.967
I didn't want you
to wake up alone.

40:03.969 --> 40:07.404
Would you like me
to do it again?

40:07.406 --> 40:08.905
Do what again?

40:12.510 --> 40:15.178
Oh, hello, mother.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.883
Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

40:23.521 --> 40:24.988
Danny.

40:28.726 --> 40:31.928
Oh, my god,
my sweet, sweet danny.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.165
Baby sister.
My sweet, sweet sister.

40:46.877 --> 40:48.745
The kitchen.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.580
Waiting on you.

40:50.582 --> 40:53.616
I had some ideas for it
when I was asleep.

41:35.627 --> 41:37.160
Hello?

41:37.162 --> 41:41.030
H-hi. Hi, ted.

41:41.032 --> 41:44.567
He is?

41:44.569 --> 41:46.803
Uh, no, no, but I-I'll tell him
right away.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.805
Okay, ted.
We're real happy to hear.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.087
Thanks for calling.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.681
That was your daddy calling.

41:58.683 --> 42:02.919
Um... Daniel's coming home.

42:02.921 --> 42:06.923
Said everything looks...
looks positive.

42:11.962 --> 42:14.230
Ted?
