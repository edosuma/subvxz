WEBVTT

00:01.117 --> 00:03.109
And if it happens again
I'll put a lock on it...

00:03.287 --> 00:05.255
so no one can enjoy it.

00:05.423 --> 00:08.085
Moving on, item seven.

00:08.259 --> 00:11.422
Oh, I'm afraid I have some tragic news.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.722
- Um, item six wasn't tragic?
Zip it.

00:13.898 --> 00:15.456
- Wow.
- Agent Hector Ruíz...

00:15.633 --> 00:17.692
<i>who had infiltrated El Frente Rojo...</i>

00:17.868 --> 00:20.132
was killed last night
when his cover was blown.

00:20.304 --> 00:21.828
- My little burrito.
- Wait, who?

00:22.006 --> 00:23.940
How in the world did his cover get blown?

00:30.781 --> 00:33.978
Ruíz? Hey man,
talk to these chicks, all right?

00:34.151 --> 00:36.847
Tell them how we're really ISIS agents!

00:37.021 --> 00:39.387
They don't believe me. Hello?

00:39.557 --> 00:41.718
<i>Señor Wingman?</i>

00:41.892 --> 00:44.622
- He probably got careless.
- I'm sure Hector didn't get...

00:44.795 --> 00:46.558
Oh, come on. Ruíz was a loose cannon.

00:46.731 --> 00:49.791
He played fast and he played loose.
And in the end, he got burned.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.525
- Be that as it may!
- Loose cannon.

00:51.702 --> 00:55.297
For ISIS to continue enjoying
Title 6 tax incentives...

00:55.473 --> 00:57.373
we have to meet certain...

00:57.541 --> 00:59.475
diversity requirements.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.804
- Oh, I think we're pretty diverse.
- Ha. Please.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.708
What? You're blackish.

01:03.881 --> 01:05.906
- Ish?
- Well, what's the word for it, Lana?

01:06.083 --> 01:08.608
- You freaked out when I said "quadroon."
- Imagine that!

01:08.786 --> 01:11.880
- You imagine it!
- Both of you, imagine shutting up!

01:12.056 --> 01:14.650
Because after losing Agent Pak last year...

01:14.825 --> 01:17.623
<i>Hey, tell this broad
what's up with ISIS, Pak-man.</i>

01:17.795 --> 01:20.263
<i>Wokka, wokka, wokka!</i>

01:20.431 --> 01:24.197
<i>And then Agent Mgumbe...
You going to this lame ISIS picnic?</i>

01:24.368 --> 01:26.859
- Loose cannons!
...the ISIS palette has become...

01:27.037 --> 01:28.595
decidedly monochromatic.

01:28.773 --> 01:31.742
- I'm one sixty-fourth Cherokee.
- Shut up!

01:31.909 --> 01:33.035
- So stupid.
- What?

01:33.210 --> 01:36.873
- A, no, you're probably not.
- And B through Z, nobody gives a shit.

01:37.047 --> 01:38.105
- Racist!
- What?

01:38.282 --> 01:39.715
You're anti-Native American.

01:41.118 --> 01:42.847
- Jeez!
- Come on.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.112
Item eight.

01:44.288 --> 01:45.880
We need a diversity hire.

01:46.056 --> 01:48.581
- I vote Asian chick.
- And after an exhaustive search...

01:48.759 --> 01:50.727
I found the perfect candidate.

01:50.895 --> 01:54.296
So join me in welcoming
our new ISIS agent...

01:54.465 --> 01:56.956
Stern. Conway Stern.

01:57.134 --> 02:00.069
He's a diversity double-whammy.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.635 --> 02:33.933
So that was the firing range...

02:34.104 --> 02:35.662
and the cafeteria, and...

02:35.840 --> 02:39.401
- Do you keep kosher?
- Well, I do have a weakness for prawns.

02:39.577 --> 02:43.274
Me too! I'll have them
make paella tomorrow.

02:43.447 --> 02:46.439
Okay, that's the mainframe,
and these are all just...

02:46.617 --> 02:48.482
drones.
- Hey, come on!

02:48.652 --> 02:51.587
Malory, these are the unsung
heroes of ISIS.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.019
Where'd we be without
my man Cyril in accounting?

02:54.191 --> 02:55.920
Hey, thanks, bro.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.994
You got it, buddy.
Or the lovely Pam in Human Resources.

02:59.163 --> 03:00.596
Yeah, I am kind of lovely.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.222
And last but not least...
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.995
- Me neither.
- See? They don't know anything.

03:07.171 --> 03:10.538
- Now, over here is a big corner office.
I see it's currently empty.

03:10.708 --> 03:12.573
Like my "vagine."

03:12.743 --> 03:16.179
Yeah, but unlike your dusty "vagine,"
it's not going to stay empty.

03:16.347 --> 03:18.838
Wait, you don't think
you're getting the office.

03:19.016 --> 03:21.246
Well, I am the Human Resources director.

03:21.418 --> 03:25.684
Pam, come on, let's face it.
Your entire job could be done by a...

03:25.856 --> 03:28.347
- A bulletin board.
- You heard Conway. I'm essential!

03:28.525 --> 03:32.621
How? I can go online and get a list
of every federal holiday for the next...

03:32.796 --> 03:35.765
- Wow, ten thousand years.
- Wait, really? Ten thousand?

03:35.933 --> 03:39.096
Hmm? Oh. No, this isn't even on.

03:40.037 --> 03:42.369
- I'm gonna get that office!
I'm getting it, Pam!

03:42.539 --> 03:46.031
Oh, my God, I am surrounded by idiots.

03:46.210 --> 03:48.906
And this is the locker room.

03:49.079 --> 03:51.172
Yeah, the, uh, lockers were a tip-off.

03:51.348 --> 03:55.284
Well, I'll leave you to it.
But if you need anything...

03:55.452 --> 03:57.579
you know how to whistle,
don't you, Conway?

03:57.755 --> 04:02.954
- Yup, lips together, blow. Got it.
- Oh. Ha, ha. You are just a little treasure.

04:04.595 --> 04:06.529
Jesus, Conway.

04:06.697 --> 04:11.191
- What have you got yourself into, man?
- You better pray it wasn't my mother.

04:11.368 --> 04:13.996
I'm fairly confident you misread
that whole situation.

04:14.171 --> 04:17.902
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm real confident you misread this one.

04:19.976 --> 04:22.070
Uh, how about this one?
- This one, uh...

04:22.246 --> 04:25.909
actually seems kind of gay.
- Maybe because our penises are touching.

04:26.083 --> 04:29.746
Yeah, so, let's go on...

04:29.920 --> 04:31.410
Three!

04:32.423 --> 04:36.086
- What? You, uh, see something you like?
- Wha...? No, you queer!

04:36.260 --> 04:37.921
Oh, I'm queer? From the guy...

04:38.095 --> 04:40.154
whose tiny gun
came with a matching purse?

04:40.331 --> 04:42.390
Hey, it's got plenty of stopping power.

04:42.566 --> 04:44.193
What? That little...?

04:44.368 --> 04:46.427
- Goddamn it, Archer! Again!
- Oh, shit.

04:46.603 --> 04:49.163
See that? He was putting on his pants
and I stopped him.

04:49.340 --> 04:52.503
So you just watch your step, mister, uh...

04:52.676 --> 04:54.507
- Damn it.
- There, should have gone with:

04:54.678 --> 04:57.203
- "Sammy Gay-vis Junior."
Damn it!

04:57.381 --> 04:59.576
Come on. She doesn't need
a corner office...

04:59.750 --> 05:03.117
just to Xerox the ISIS newsletter.
- Color Xerox.

05:03.287 --> 05:05.653
And what, you need more room
to chop vegetables?

05:05.823 --> 05:08.917
All right! Obviously,
I need to make a decision.

05:09.093 --> 05:11.186
But which shall it...? Oh!

05:11.362 --> 05:13.296
Or I could just give Conway both!

05:13.464 --> 05:15.932
- You what?
- I already took care of those.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.091
Frodo and Salsa were my operations.

05:18.268 --> 05:21.669
At ease, Career Admiral,
Malory was getting impatient on Salsa.

05:21.839 --> 05:24.603
- Salsa was a highly complex operation.
- Two phone calls.

05:24.775 --> 05:27.300
- And as for Frodo...
Wha...?

05:27.478 --> 05:30.106
Well, some pun involving hobbits.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.182
Like, I bet he wishes he was wearing
Bilbo's coat of Dwarven mithril.

05:34.351 --> 05:36.012
- Gonna take your word on that.
- Yeah?

05:36.186 --> 05:38.484
Well, take my word on this.

05:38.655 --> 05:40.520
I am the top agent around here.

05:40.691 --> 05:42.955
- So watch it!
- So, see, in Middle-earth...

05:43.127 --> 05:45.118
Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

05:45.295 --> 05:46.353
Come on, buddy.

05:46.530 --> 05:48.657
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm dead serious.

05:48.832 --> 05:50.663
I wanna file a complaint
against Conway.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.769
- On what grounds?
- He touched my penis with his penis.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.234
- Wow.
- Yeah.

05:55.406 --> 05:57.931
He just came up to me and was like:
"Byoop!"

05:58.108 --> 06:00.736
- Where?
- All of it. Head and shaft.

06:00.911 --> 06:03.106
- And... Oh, you mean where in the building.
- No.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.772
- That shouldn't matter, Pam.
- I got this other complaint from Brett...

06:06.950 --> 06:08.508
who said you shot him again.
- Uh...

06:08.685 --> 06:10.118
here's the thing about Brett.

06:12.389 --> 06:15.256
Oh, shit! Those were the newsletters!

06:15.526 --> 06:18.393
Cyril, I need a little favor.

06:18.562 --> 06:20.359
Okay, Carin... Oh.

06:20.531 --> 06:22.362
- Now it's Cristal?
Cristal.

06:23.867 --> 06:26.199
You know? Like the champagne.
It's what hot black guys drink.

06:26.370 --> 06:29.737
- Uh, you sure about that?
- And I want Conway to drink me...

06:29.907 --> 06:33.536
so I need you to hook a sister up.
- Well, I will certainly try.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.701
Don't try, do. And here, use this.

06:38.582 --> 06:39.742
Wow, what is this?

06:39.917 --> 06:43.978
Tell Conway that his Secret Santa
wants to come early.

06:45.456 --> 06:48.323
Or, you know, whoever brings Jewish
people their Christmas presents.

06:49.693 --> 06:51.820
What are you doing?
- Uh, none of your businessing.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.930
What kind of spy agency
scrimps on a freaking shredder?

06:55.099 --> 06:58.091
Apparently the kind that scrimps
on background checks.

06:58.268 --> 07:00.031
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.

07:00.204 --> 07:03.196
But I got a bad feeling
about Mother's little "Project Conway."

07:03.373 --> 07:05.273
So I must be having a stroke...

07:05.442 --> 07:08.240
because we actually agree on something.
- Wait, really?

07:08.412 --> 07:10.505
Totally. I mean,
he shows up out of nowhere...

07:10.681 --> 07:12.945
and starts trying to get all up
in everything?

07:13.117 --> 07:14.948
I mean, Salsa, Frodo.

07:15.119 --> 07:17.679
- Possibly Mother.
- And what do we even know about him?

07:17.855 --> 07:20.847
- Only that he's not circumcised.
- Okay.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.391
- Glossing over how you know that...
- We touched penises.

07:24.561 --> 07:25.858
No! Glossing.

07:26.029 --> 07:29.055
But a non-circumcised Jewish guy,
that's not weird to you?

07:29.233 --> 07:31.531
No, why would...?
I mean, I'm not Jewish...

07:31.702 --> 07:34.762
and I'm circumcised. So it can...
- It doesn't work like that.

07:34.938 --> 07:37.702
Lana, come on.
I think we both know it works fine.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.571
Oh, come on. Not your dick, dumbass.

07:40.744 --> 07:43.076
Oh, my God!
This is about you and me, right?

07:43.247 --> 07:46.808
- Oh, my God! Get over yourself!
- Hey, I am over me.

07:46.984 --> 07:48.576
But apparently you're not.

07:50.154 --> 07:55.387
- What the hell smells like shrimp?
- Just my sensual womanhood.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.151
Oh, wait. Ew.

07:57.327 --> 07:59.261
I bet your womanhood smells divine.

07:59.429 --> 08:02.921
- Conway!
- Now, whom can I thank for these shrimps?

08:03.100 --> 08:07.161
Me, your secret Jew Santa.

08:09.673 --> 08:13.131
Conway! That was amazing.

08:13.310 --> 08:15.540
Yes, so, uh...

08:15.712 --> 08:16.736
okay.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.940
- Oh, my God, I hope I'm pregnant.
- What are you talking about?

08:20.117 --> 08:23.314
The system bounced your sexual
harassment complaint against Conway.

08:23.487 --> 08:26.354
- Well, unbounce it back.
- Who am I, Tron?

08:26.523 --> 08:28.252
Talk to your mother, she bounced it.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.756
- Why?
- Hey. Whoa.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.327
- Why would she do that?
- Don't go starting rumors...

08:32.496 --> 08:34.327
about Conway boning your mother.
- Oh, my...

08:37.400 --> 08:40.859
- You get any of that in the trash can?
- No.

08:41.038 --> 08:42.869
I, uh, missed it on purpose.

08:43.039 --> 08:46.532
- Hey, Malory, uh, you got a second?
- I sincerely doubt it.

08:46.710 --> 08:50.305
- It's about Conway.
- Then yes, I have entire minutes.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.311
Isn't he just a dream come true?

08:52.482 --> 08:56.213
Well, that's the thing.
How did you actually find Conway?

08:56.386 --> 08:58.616
Well, he just sort of appeared.

08:58.789 --> 09:01.587
- Uh, yes, okay.
- Like a foundling, carved out of onyx.

09:01.758 --> 09:05.660
Yes, but from where? I mean,
if you didn't do a background check...

09:05.829 --> 09:08.730
Are you an idiot?
Or do you just think I am?

09:08.899 --> 09:12.027
- He totally checked out.
- Okay, so do you mind if I take a little...?

09:12.202 --> 09:16.332
Lana Kane! Just because now
you're not the only black agent...

09:16.506 --> 09:20.203
- Hey, that is not...
- Urban. Whatever.

09:20.377 --> 09:24.643
You come in here
and accuse Conway of what, exactly?

09:24.815 --> 09:28.148
Okay, fine,
I can't prove anything right now.

09:28.318 --> 09:32.118
But that never stopped J. Edna Hoover
from persecuting Martin Luther King...

09:32.289 --> 09:34.655
now, did it?
- What does that have to do...?

09:34.825 --> 09:36.383
Wait, J. Edna?

09:36.560 --> 09:40.394
You never heard that? How Hoover was
this huge, cross-dressing chicken hawk?

09:40.564 --> 09:43.897
- I had not.
- That's exactly the kind of slanderous...

09:44.067 --> 09:47.833
and unsubstantiated rumor
I will not tolerate at ISIS.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.065
- Think about that while on suspension.
- While I'm on what?

09:51.241 --> 09:53.266
- What are you, deaf and racist?
- Wha...?

09:53.443 --> 09:56.674
- I'm black.
- Oh, put it back in the deck.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.873
- Hey, how is my lovely lady.
- Suspended.

10:00.050 --> 10:01.950
- What?
- Malory suspended me.

10:02.119 --> 10:05.418
Just because I had the nerve
to ask questions about her little...

10:05.589 --> 10:08.581
homeboy McJewerson.
- Whoa, Lana, honey.

10:08.759 --> 10:10.954
- What?
- Even though it's perfectly natural...

10:11.128 --> 10:12.618
for you to be jealous of Conway...

10:14.965 --> 10:19.061
Then she cold-cocked you, huh?
- Yeah, with that big Flintstoney fist of hers.

10:19.236 --> 10:22.569
- Seriously, "Homeboy McJewerson"?
- Oh, come on, I've heard worse than that.

10:22.739 --> 10:24.468
Yeah, but it doesn't even make sense.

10:24.641 --> 10:28.077
- I mean, maybe if you were Scottish or...
- Hey, man, racism, anti-Semitism.

10:28.245 --> 10:31.646
You can't go looking for logic in it.
Here, this'll help the swelling.

10:31.815 --> 10:34.147
Oh, thank you. Ha, ha.
Where'd you get the steak?

10:34.318 --> 10:38.186
Cristal. Yet another offering
of unrefrigerated meat and/or seafood.

10:38.355 --> 10:42.485
- Yeah, she's kind of weird that way.
- She's kind of weird a bunch of ways.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.118
What you doing, Birdbones?

10:45.295 --> 10:48.560
- Looking for a pregnancy test online.
- But there's a drugstore half a...

10:48.732 --> 10:51.895
Oh. You mean that you take online.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.266
- Yeah I want to know like, now.
- Well, thank God for them internets.

10:55.439 --> 10:58.772
- Okay, what is this lame meeting about?
- No idea, I'm busy and go away.

10:58.942 --> 11:01.308
- Excuse me?
- Oh, my God, why are you still here?

11:01.478 --> 11:04.743
- Mother called me for a meeting.
- But I thought you called a meeting.

11:04.915 --> 11:08.908
Oh, and by the way, you don't
call a meeting, only I call a meeting.

11:09.086 --> 11:12.487
I called the meeting.
- Which I love. That you did that.

11:12.656 --> 11:14.385
I know it's not standard procedure...

11:14.558 --> 11:18.255
but we've got a problem.
- A problem or a blessing?

11:20.063 --> 11:21.087
A problem.

11:21.264 --> 11:24.631
It's a silent submarine propulsion
system, called the Whisper Drive.

11:24.801 --> 11:27.201
- Oh, sounds sexy.
- Would you stop it.

11:27.371 --> 11:28.702
- Folks, please.
- Embarrassing.

11:28.872 --> 11:31.067
- You are embarrassing.
- Jesus.

11:31.241 --> 11:35.177
This is Wilhelm Schmeck,
inventor of the Whisper Drive.

11:35.345 --> 11:38.371
Schmeck went missing
along with the plans for the Whisper Drive.

11:38.548 --> 11:41.517
I tracked him to South Beach.
He's arranged to sell the plans...

11:41.685 --> 11:44.347
to Cuban Naval Intelligence.
If that happens...

11:44.521 --> 11:49.220
undetectable Cuban missile subs
could be parked right off Miami Beach.

11:49.393 --> 11:52.556
Ugh. Just what Miami needs.
More Cubans.

11:52.729 --> 11:56.460
And all we need is a stand-in,
who resembles Schmeck's Cuban contact...

11:56.633 --> 12:00.034
Wha...? What? That looks nothing like me.

12:00.203 --> 12:02.398
- Well, he's just a lot more handsome.
- Whatever.

12:02.572 --> 12:04.836
Zip it! Conway, dear?

12:05.008 --> 12:06.873
- The plan?
- Using Archer as bait...

12:07.043 --> 12:11.207
we slip in just ahead of the real Cubans,
capture Schmeck, and recover the plans.

12:11.381 --> 12:13.975
If we could run this thing
through your condo, that...

12:14.151 --> 12:16.711
- You have a South Beach condo?
- I, uh...

12:16.887 --> 12:18.650
Oh, hey, how's the, uh, lemon tree doing?

12:18.822 --> 12:21.484
RaúI says it already has tiny lemons.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.649
That was a wonderful thank-you gift.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.295
- Well, it was a wonderful weekend.
- It was, wasn't it?

12:26.463 --> 12:28.897
You were there, in the condo, together?

12:29.065 --> 12:30.692
- Yeah, last weekend.
Oh, my God.

12:32.135 --> 12:36.333
Oh, for... See? That's what happens
when you drink all day and skip lunch.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.100
Oh, we were supposed to have paella.

12:43.046 --> 12:45.105
Archer, come on, man, let's go.

12:45.282 --> 12:47.944
You go! Get on the plane,
buckle in, sit there...

12:48.118 --> 12:50.678
and think about how you're not
the boss of me.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.118
Hey, babe. Got any extra puke bags?

12:53.290 --> 12:55.349
Why? You taking a moral inventory?

12:55.525 --> 12:58.460
Jesus, God,
what are you doing here?

12:58.628 --> 13:00.562
- I'm, trying to save...
- A relationship?

13:00.730 --> 13:05.133
Lana, maybe when I get back, we can work
out some kind of bang-buddy deal, but...

13:05.302 --> 13:06.667
Ow!

13:06.837 --> 13:11.501
- I want you to listen to me.
- Well then unperforate my eardrum.

13:11.675 --> 13:13.040
Un...

13:13.210 --> 13:14.837
head up your ass!

13:15.011 --> 13:16.876
I think Conway is totally up to something.

13:17.047 --> 13:20.744
Duh! You think I'm an idiot?
I know he wants to marry Mother...

13:20.917 --> 13:22.748
and cut me out of the will.
- Ugh. Archer.

13:22.919 --> 13:26.480
- Which is why I'm going to kill him.
- Oh. Okay, well, whatever the reason.

13:26.656 --> 13:29.284
It's not because of the whole
black stepfather thing.

13:29.459 --> 13:31.484
- You know me better than that.
- Yeah, I do.

13:31.661 --> 13:34.824
So try not to do anything stupid, okay?
Conway could be dangerous.

13:34.998 --> 13:36.488
Yeah. You know what's dangerous?

13:36.666 --> 13:38.133
- Your obsession with me.
- Just...

13:38.301 --> 13:40.997
Seriously Lana, call Kenny Loggins
because you're in the Danger Zone.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.930
<i>- From Top Gun.
- Just be careful.</i>

13:46.743 --> 13:48.005
No.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.643
God, this is so classic Mother.

13:55.819 --> 13:57.582
Yeah, it's pretty tastefully done, huh?

13:57.754 --> 13:59.915
No, you ass. The selfishness.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.081
She never shares anything with anybody.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.090
You're keeping that office for you?

14:04.261 --> 14:07.389
I need it to escape the glare
from those windows across the street.

14:07.564 --> 14:09.589
From the...? There's no glare.

14:09.766 --> 14:13.998
Well, not now. But mid-April?
Every morning. For almost 20 minutes.

14:14.170 --> 14:17.139
So you're gonna keep that huge
corner office empty the other...

14:17.307 --> 14:21.107
- Ninety-gazillion percent of the time.
- Just because the glare is annoying?

14:21.278 --> 14:24.145
Well, semi-annoying.

14:24.314 --> 14:27.181
Okay, you're meeting Schmeck
at that café across the street.

14:27.350 --> 14:31.184
- And, uh, why do you have that? Exactly?
- You never know what's gonna happen.

14:31.354 --> 14:35.381
Yeah, two people all alone together,
down here in South Beach.

14:35.559 --> 14:37.925
I'd rather have it and not need it...
- Uh-huh.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.619
Than need it and not have it.
- Ah. Uh-huh.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.357
Kind of like a condom.
Which happened last weekend.

14:43.533 --> 14:46.525
- Oh, my...! Ugh!
- Damn, man, I was kidding!

14:46.703 --> 14:49.137
- Look, if you're too nervous...
- I'm fine, all right?

14:49.306 --> 14:51.900
Just let me rinse off my mustache.

14:52.075 --> 14:54.737
You are more handsome in your photos.

14:54.911 --> 14:57.141
Oh, yeah, talk to me about handsome.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.509
And you have no trace of Cuban accent.

14:59.683 --> 15:01.412
Yeah, it's called tradecraft, genius.

15:01.585 --> 15:04.247
- I blend.
- Just shut up and get the plans.

15:04.421 --> 15:06.355
- You shut up and get the plans.
- What?

15:06.523 --> 15:09.356
I mean, give me those plans now.
Give me those plans.

15:09.526 --> 15:12.495
You may have them once I confirm
the balance in my Swiss account.

15:13.029 --> 15:14.428
- Tell him not to bother.
- What?

15:14.598 --> 15:16.327
<i>Wait, what are we doing?</i>

15:17.801 --> 15:21.100
- Conway! What the shit, man?
- What? Schmeck was a traitor.

15:21.271 --> 15:24.206
Yeah, now he's all over
my 400 dollar custom shirt.

15:24.374 --> 15:27.537
I'll buy you a new one.
Now grab the plans before it's too late.

15:27.711 --> 15:32.239
- It's already too late.
- Ha, ha! Yes it is, now hand over...

15:32.415 --> 15:35.179
Because it's already
soaked into the fibers, dumbass.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.910
This is linen!

15:38.755 --> 15:41.747
And that is a Cuban hit squad.

15:41.925 --> 15:43.756
And you might want to duck.

15:47.797 --> 15:50.288
Oh, my God. Conway!

15:50.467 --> 15:53.436
- That was amazing!
- Yeah, well, you know.

15:53.603 --> 15:55.901
No, seriously, that was like...

15:56.072 --> 15:58.700
- That was like, uh...
- A Charles Whitman Sampler?

15:58.875 --> 16:01.537
Damn it, yes. Seriously, thanks.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.906
Oh, don't thank me yet.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.139
What, Conway? No!

16:07.684 --> 16:10.312
- Now you can thank me.
- Oh, my God.

16:10.487 --> 16:11.954
You saved my life twice.

16:12.122 --> 16:13.453
You'd have done the same for me.

16:13.623 --> 16:14.783
- No, I wouldn't have.
- Ha, ha.

16:14.958 --> 16:17.153
I was actually kind of planning to kill you.

16:17.327 --> 16:20.296
- Wait, what?
- I know, now I'm totally embarrassed.

16:20.463 --> 16:22.863
Hey, you know what?
Water under the bridge, dude.

16:23.033 --> 16:26.127
- Come over here, let's man-hug it.
- All right. Okay. Um...

16:26.970 --> 16:30.098
I mean, after all we are going to be family.
Once I marry your Mom.

16:30.273 --> 16:33.936
- What?
- I'm kidding. God, relax, man.

16:34.110 --> 16:37.546
Because for a second there, I was like...
I mean, not in a racist way, but...

16:39.115 --> 16:40.446
- Conway?
- Yeah, buddy.

16:40.617 --> 16:44.144
- Uh, are there more bad guys behind me?
- Nope.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.117
You dick.

16:48.391 --> 16:50.985
You dumbass. I set this whole thing up.

16:51.161 --> 16:53.561
I just needed a stand-in
for those broke-ass Cubans.

16:53.730 --> 16:56.096
- Yeah, I get it.
- I mean, come on!

16:56.266 --> 16:59.030
The Chinese'll pay five times
as much for the Whisper Drive.

16:59.202 --> 17:03.366
And once they do? Let's just say you better
learn to use some chopsticks, buddy.

17:03.540 --> 17:06.338
Conway, wait.
Just answer me one question.

17:06.509 --> 17:08.443
Yeah, make it quick. My ride is here.

17:10.646 --> 17:14.446
- And your lungs are filling up with blood.
- Did you have sex with my mother?

17:14.617 --> 17:17.108
Wait, what?
That is your only question?

17:17.287 --> 17:20.313
Not who am I,
not how did I infiltrate ISIS...

17:20.490 --> 17:24.118
or who the hell is flying the helicopter?
- Just answer the question!

17:24.294 --> 17:27.627
No, Archer,
I didn't have sex with your mom.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.958
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, and that?

17:30.133 --> 17:32.795
That would have been a though image
to get out of my head.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.834
That, right there?
That kind of racism...

17:35.004 --> 17:38.997
is exactly why I can't wait to see tiny
little Chinese boots...

17:39.175 --> 17:41.871
on your white-ass necks.

17:42.045 --> 17:45.811
Which may sound hypocritical,
I know, but...

17:45.982 --> 17:47.745
Would you go?

17:47.917 --> 17:51.284
- Aah! What the...?
- Sorry, Conway.

17:51.454 --> 17:53.945
- Oh, wait, shit, I had something for this.
- Aah.

17:54.124 --> 17:57.355
Is it something like, uh,
"You don't get off the hook that easy"?

17:57.527 --> 17:59.552
- Damn it.
- Yeah, he's good at those.

17:59.729 --> 18:02.254
- Well, crawl on over there and blow him.
- Hey, come on.

18:02.432 --> 18:06.926
- Now, drop the case, Conway!
- It's cuffed on, woman.

18:07.103 --> 18:10.334
Aah! And how the hell are your hands
that freaking strong...?

18:12.442 --> 18:13.704
Ew.

18:13.877 --> 18:17.074
You haven't seen the last of Conway Stern!

18:17.247 --> 18:20.239
Which is not my real name!

18:21.851 --> 18:23.546
Uh, so let me guess.
- Yeah.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.019
Whoever he is, he ghosted an ID file
onto our worldwide database.

18:27.190 --> 18:30.023
Yeah. Which you probably found
while researching me.

18:31.628 --> 18:33.323
Lana, because you're in the, uh...

18:33.496 --> 18:35.794
...Danger Zone.

18:35.965 --> 18:38.195
And those were his last words.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.734
Right before he bled to death on the rug.

18:40.904 --> 18:45.466
Which rug? Oh, good.
I thought you meant in the bedroom.

18:45.642 --> 18:49.339
No, that one is just jute. Exactly.

18:49.512 --> 18:53.175
Guests come in from the beach,
they're all sandy or whatever, and...

18:53.349 --> 18:57.445
Suspension? Lana, dear,
you are getting a bonus. My God!

18:57.620 --> 19:01.454
You foiled that perfidious Conway,
saved Sterling's...

19:01.624 --> 19:03.819
All right, just pull the knife out.

19:05.662 --> 19:08.096
And then slap Saran Wrap on the hole.

19:08.264 --> 19:10.459
Oh! But leave me enough
to make guacamole.

19:10.633 --> 19:15.798
No, you squeeze lemon juice over it, then
smush the Saran Wrap right down on top.

19:15.972 --> 19:19.874
That way it doesn't go brown.
Oh, let the paramedics do that.

19:20.043 --> 19:23.570
You just have fun, dear. Mm-hm. Bye.

19:23.746 --> 19:28.410
Oh, damn. Now I bet she's going to
squeeze up all my brand new lemons.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.349
And I'll have nothing left
to remind me of Conway.

19:31.521 --> 19:35.013
- Except his little mocha love child.
- His what?

19:35.191 --> 19:37.022
Yeah.
- You had sex with Conway?

19:37.193 --> 19:39.286
Yeah, and he totally impregnated me.

19:39.462 --> 19:42.761
Wait, he was only here two days.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.628
How is that pregnancy test
showing positive?

19:45.802 --> 19:49.704
Oh, this is just a detergent pen.
I just put a little blue sticker on it.
