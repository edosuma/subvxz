Considered a folk hero.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.990

Planted an olive
tree for Emma. (exhales)

I don't answer to Bassam.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.950
It's no secret he doesn't
support me for president.

no background

08:31.570 --> 08:35.010
was put in such
an important position?

And who's to say?

08:59.030 --> 09:00.630
Maybe it is.

09:00.630 --> 09:03.740
But Bassam compartmentalizes.

09:03.740 --> 09:06.910
The minute you become
a liability,

09:06.910 --> 09:08.680
a wall will come down.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.270
People need a
place to pray.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.810
Then let them pray at
the university's Central Mosque.

10:48.810 --> 10:50.710
At least there,

15:23.080 --> 15:24.780
If all they were doing
was praying,

15:24.790 --> 15:26.150
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

15:26.150 --> 15:27.320
But that's not the reality.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.860
They are terrorist cells.

15:28.860 --> 15:30.460
You have no evidence
 of that.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.790
You're implying anywhere
people gather to pray is

15:32.790 --> 15:34.390
a breeding ground
 for terror.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.230
No, I am not.

15:35.230 --> 15:37.730
You can pray freely
in the Central Mosque.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.000
(scoffs)

15:39.000 --> 15:40.570
Under your watchful eye.

15:40.570 --> 15:43.340
With him preaching.

15:43.340 --> 15:45.740
Everyone knows that he
is an Al Fayeed stooge.

15:45.740 --> 15:47.140
What, now he will
peddle your

15:47.140 --> 15:49.850
government-sanctioned
religious message?

15:49.850 --> 15:52.550
I wonder if you would
be so poisonous if your

15:52.550 --> 15:55.950
Caliphate-loving brother-in-law
had not paid for your mosque.

15:58.220 --> 16:01.650
I will have no part in this.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.260
(footsteps departing)
(door slams)

16:04.260 --> 16:06.230
You have strong
favorables among males,

16:06.230 --> 16:08.760
45 to 64.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.660
The youth numbers
are softer.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.000
What's the bottom line?

16:12.000 --> 16:15.130
You're 15 points behind
Fauzi among likely voters.

16:24.710 --> 16:27.110
I see.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.090
(Safiya) It isn't what
we were hoping for.

16:29.090 --> 16:31.250
(Kipfer) But it's
what we expected.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.690
It's just the first poll.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.690
Wait until I testify

16:34.690 --> 16:38.460
in front of the
Truth and Dignity Commission.

16:38.460 --> 16:41.230
Things will get worse.

16:41.230 --> 16:42.800
Thank you, both of you.

16:48.370 --> 16:51.140
(door opens, closes)

16:51.140 --> 16:52.670
Second place.

16:52.670 --> 16:55.310
That's never been
a comfortable position for you.

16:55.310 --> 16:57.610
It's not where I should be.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.550
(Ahmed exhales sharply)

17:01.550 --> 17:04.790
(Leila) Someone who will take a stand
against our external enemies,

17:04.790 --> 17:06.720
against anyone
who would threaten us,

17:06.720 --> 17:09.460
to ensure the future
of this great nation.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.359
(reporter) Leila Al Fayeed.

17:11.359 --> 17:16.900
Experience, security,
stability, prosperity.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.030
It's you.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.930
It's the person
that I know.

17:21.940 --> 17:25.040
The Iron Lady.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.410
It's only part of me.

17:26.410 --> 17:29.040
Maybe that's your problem.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.010
No one knows
 the other part.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.080
(crowd cheering)

17:40.550 --> 17:41.790
Thank you.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.290
Thank you, thank you, 
thank you.

17:44.290 --> 17:45.790
It's good to see all of you.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.290
(man) We love you!

17:47.300 --> 17:48.290
(chuckles)

17:48.300 --> 17:50.560
I love you back!

17:50.570 --> 17:53.030
And I want to begin today
by saying

17:53.030 --> 17:55.470
thank you so much
for all your support.

17:55.470 --> 17:57.370
I know you guys
have been working hard,

17:57.370 --> 17:58.870
and you know what?

17:58.870 --> 18:00.010
It's paying off.

18:00.010 --> 18:03.740
It's just the first poll,
and we have a long way to go,

18:03.750 --> 18:05.750
but we had
 a good day today.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.050
(crowd cheering)

18:09.450 --> 18:11.150
You're good. Thank you.
Thank you.

18:11.150 --> 18:12.550
- We love you, man.
- Thank you. Thank you so much. 

18:12.550 --> 18:14.050
Thank you.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.660
So, what'd you think
of the speech?

18:17.660 --> 18:19.830
Uh, not bad.

18:19.830 --> 18:20.960
"Not..."

18:20.960 --> 18:22.630
On a scale of
one to ten?

18:22.630 --> 18:25.260
I'd give it a six and a half.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.770
Six and a half?

18:26.770 --> 18:28.270
You're not an
easy grader.

18:28.270 --> 18:31.100
But at least you stuck
around for the whole thing.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.940
Yeah, I wanted to see
if it got any better.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.610
- Well, thank you.
- (Daliyah chuckles)

18:35.610 --> 18:36.910
(chuckles)

18:36.910 --> 18:38.510
The polls look good.

18:38.510 --> 18:39.910
Yeah, don't jinx it now.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.610
You must be happy.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.350
I am.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.250
You know,

18:47.260 --> 18:50.260
a few of us are going
to a cafe for a drink.

18:50.260 --> 18:51.360
You should join us.

18:52.930 --> 18:54.960
Come on,
celebrate with me.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.000
I'm politically neutral.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.360
Requirement of the job.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.000
I understand.

19:02.370 --> 19:05.270
I had a dream about
you, you know.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.770
Really?

19:06.770 --> 19:09.040
Yeah, we were rollerblading
in a park in London.

19:09.040 --> 19:13.780
And I was late for a rally,
so we decided to hail a taxi.

19:13.780 --> 19:16.620
- But Angela Merkel was driving and... and...
- (Daliyah laughing)

19:16.620 --> 19:18.950
she wouldn't let us in
because of the rollerblades,

19:18.950 --> 19:21.390
so we grabbed onto
the side of the cab

19:21.390 --> 19:24.160
and she took off,
dragging us the whole way.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.160
Well, at least Angela Merkel
wasn't naked.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.530
Yeah.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.660
- Did we have fun?
- We had a great time.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.300
(chuckles) Good.

19:40.410 --> 19:43.440
Staring at the poll numbers
all day won't change them.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.920
The things you said to
Bassam in the Palace,

19:50.920 --> 19:52.820
you need to say
them to the people.

19:52.820 --> 19:55.320
Fauzi and Leila,

19:55.320 --> 19:57.390
they're part of the
administration.

19:57.390 --> 19:58.760
They can't speak out.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.030
You can.

20:00.030 --> 20:03.100
But nobody's listening, Nafisa.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.530
Nobody's listening.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.670
There are protests planned
at the university.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.000
You should be there.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.700
Make them into
a campaign rally.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.640
Make the President
your enemy.

20:16.580 --> 20:21.680
Bassam gave you a gift with
the prayer space closures.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.280
Take it.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.430
(door opens)
(footsteps approach)

20:32.430 --> 20:34.230
(Barry) Hey. You're up.

20:34.230 --> 20:36.060
It's good to see.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.330
Barry.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.270
What's going on?

20:41.270 --> 20:45.140
There's an in-patient
treatment center in Germany.

20:45.140 --> 20:47.340
I... I'm gonna check
 myself in.

20:47.340 --> 20:49.340
(shaky breathing)

20:51.110 --> 20:52.850
Okay, uh, Molly,
 look, look.

20:54.820 --> 20:58.350
I want you to get help.
But let's talk about this.

20:58.350 --> 21:00.320
I need you to arrange
a plane for me.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.120
I need you to
do that, okay?

21:02.120 --> 21:03.420
Molly, I know you're in pain...

21:03.420 --> 21:05.060
Barry, it's not
safe for me.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.830
I've come so close to...

21:12.300 --> 21:16.100
I don't trust myself.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.800
I need to go get better.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.470
You can get better here.
With us.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.340
I can't.

21:23.340 --> 21:25.510
It's too hard.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.820
I keep looking out the window,
thinking I'm, um,

21:33.820 --> 21:36.690
gonna see the person
I used to be walking by.

21:36.690 --> 21:38.860
I've been working too much,
haven't been here for you.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.130
Dad, it's not about you.

21:40.130 --> 21:43.260
And I know that
 you're angry

21:43.260 --> 21:46.930
- and you blame me for what happened.
- I blame myself.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.570
I'm guilty.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.340
I'll carry that
the rest of my life.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.910
- Molly, please don't do this.
- It's taking

21:54.910 --> 21:59.310
everything I have
to ask for help, Barry.

21:59.310 --> 22:02.520
And maybe you'll understand,
and maybe you won't,

22:02.520 --> 22:05.890
but I can't be here
 anymore.

22:07.820 --> 22:11.490
I walk past her room
and I see her.

22:11.490 --> 22:14.590
I look at your faces
and I see her. (sobs)

22:16.960 --> 22:19.270
I thought I wanted that.

22:19.270 --> 22:23.800
The reminders... they made me
feel close to her.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.500
But when you're alone
 with them,

22:25.510 --> 22:28.140
you realize there's nothing
really there.

22:30.080 --> 22:34.110
Just... loss and more loss.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.110
(sighs sharply)

22:44.160 --> 22:46.090
How long
 will you be gone?

22:46.090 --> 22:48.160
I don't know.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.570
You want to know what
you can do for me, Barry?

22:57.700 --> 22:59.770
You can let me go.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.160
(birds chirping)

23:17.160 --> 23:19.860
Could you pass
the coffee?

23:19.860 --> 23:22.130
Yeah.

23:22.130 --> 23:24.400
- Oh, I must've finished it.
- That's okay.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.970
- I'll get them to make some more.
- No, don't... don't worry about it.

23:25.970 --> 23:27.800
I'm fine.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.870
Had too much already.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.870
(paper rustling)

23:40.110 --> 23:42.680
Maybe we should get
 a dog.

23:44.650 --> 23:46.590
What?

23:46.590 --> 23:48.360
People have been
sending us things.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.420
Gifts, you know.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.060
For Emma.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.630
Someone wrote and

23:53.630 --> 23:55.830
said they wanted
to give us a puppy.

23:59.300 --> 24:02.400
You remember when Emma
got bitten by that dog

24:02.400 --> 24:04.470
when she was little?

24:06.470 --> 24:08.640
That was me.

24:10.010 --> 24:13.650
No, it was the, um...

24:13.650 --> 24:15.650
the Kreutziger's
German Shepherd.

24:15.650 --> 24:17.180
It, uh... she was
trying to pet it.

24:17.180 --> 24:18.920
Thor.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.550
He bit me.

24:24.820 --> 24:26.890
It was a long time ago.

24:32.530 --> 24:35.000
I, um...

24:35.000 --> 24:37.670
I called the treatment center
this morning.

24:37.670 --> 24:39.870
They said your mom's
getting settled in.

24:42.340 --> 24:45.710
Dad, I really think
you should give her some space.

24:48.980 --> 24:50.620
I know.

24:52.620 --> 24:54.350
I know.

25:03.830 --> 25:06.970
The Abuddinian Women's Forum
has been a constructive voice

25:06.970 --> 25:09.470
on women's issues
for a quarter century.

25:09.470 --> 25:12.200
In order to be your next
President and put women's issues

25:12.210 --> 25:14.370
on the agenda
in this country,

25:14.380 --> 25:16.240
I'm going to need your support.

25:16.240 --> 25:20.380
In 20 years in the Palace,
and two years as First Lady,

25:20.380 --> 25:21.850
you never showed
up here once.

25:21.850 --> 25:23.820
- That's true.
- Now you want us

25:23.820 --> 25:27.020
to support you for president
just because you're a woman?

25:27.020 --> 25:32.320
The forum was highly critical
of my husband and his father.

25:32.330 --> 25:35.060
It was very difficult for me
to express my true feelings.

25:35.060 --> 25:39.330
1,000 women and 400 children
died in the gassing of Ma'an.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.230
And you stood by your husband's
side and said nothing.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.510
Many of us know
what it means to live

25:46.510 --> 25:48.240
under the thumbs
 of our husband.

25:48.240 --> 25:53.010
All of us know people who have
died for what they believed in.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.950
You survived by staying silent.

26:06.590 --> 26:07.860
What's that?

26:07.860 --> 26:09.700
<i> Fanaa.</i>

26:09.700 --> 26:11.200
What does it mean?

26:13.470 --> 26:14.800
The loss of the self.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.270
Thought we were
gonna start small.

26:17.270 --> 26:19.910
Like "cat" or something.

26:19.910 --> 26:22.440
Oh, I like to
challenge my students.

26:22.440 --> 26:23.310
Hmm.

26:28.580 --> 26:30.620
You ever done this before
with another student?

26:30.620 --> 26:32.580
"This"?

26:32.590 --> 26:34.420
Ah, you mean
teach Arabic?

26:34.420 --> 26:35.720
Mm.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.990
No.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.060
So I'm special.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.200
Very.

26:46.070 --> 26:48.470
Why?

26:48.470 --> 26:49.940
Really?

26:49.940 --> 26:51.500
You want me to
flatter you?

26:51.510 --> 26:52.770
No.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.840
I want you
to tell me the truth.

26:56.510 --> 26:59.080
You're sleeping with me
'cause I'm the President's son.

27:01.850 --> 27:06.250
If I was sleeping with you
to get ahead in politics,

27:06.250 --> 27:09.920
I wouldn't be criticizing
your father online.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.720
You're criticizing him?

27:13.690 --> 27:15.090
Don't you read my blog?

27:15.100 --> 27:16.600
I don't like you that much.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.130
Oh.

27:18.130 --> 27:20.200
What are you saying?

27:21.840 --> 27:24.440
I said he's wrong to
close the prayer spaces.

27:24.440 --> 27:29.340
Well, he thinks
those people are dangerous.

27:29.340 --> 27:31.640
Who's dangerous?

27:31.650 --> 27:34.510
All Muslims who pray
in any prayer space?

27:34.520 --> 27:36.050
They're all dangerous?

27:37.380 --> 27:39.250
What if the governments decide

27:39.250 --> 27:41.320
all gay men are dangerous?

27:41.320 --> 27:43.690
(crowd chanting outside)

27:46.990 --> 27:49.330
(crowd chanting) Let us pray!
 Let us pray!

27:49.330 --> 27:51.500
Let us pray!
Let us pray!

27:51.500 --> 27:54.500
Let us pray! We want to pray!

27:54.500 --> 27:56.070
Let us pray!

27:56.070 --> 27:58.700
We want to pray!
We want to pray!

27:58.710 --> 28:00.310
I'm on my way
 to the university.

28:00.310 --> 28:04.140
I only have a minute, but...
how are you?

28:04.140 --> 28:05.380
How's my nephew?

28:05.380 --> 28:07.680
Is he still smarter
than both of us?

28:07.680 --> 28:09.180
(Latif) Of course.

28:09.180 --> 28:11.650
They've closed
 the schools,

28:11.650 --> 28:13.850
so I've been tutoring
the kids at home.

28:13.850 --> 28:15.420
They closed the schools? Why?

28:15.420 --> 28:17.360
The Caliphate claim
they want to govern,

28:17.360 --> 28:18.520
but they can't manage it.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.130
The phones, schools, hospitals,
everything's shut down.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.760
I didn't know it was that bad.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.570
And we just got a warning
about more bombings.

28:29.570 --> 28:31.540
Some people are talking
about leaving,

28:31.540 --> 28:33.370
crossing the border
into Abuddin.

28:33.370 --> 28:35.670
I heard they set up
a refugee camp.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.240
You should come
with them, Latif.

28:37.240 --> 28:38.240
It's hard.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.150
This is Randa's home,
her country.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.680
And I've heard
things are difficult

28:43.680 --> 28:45.080
on your side
 of the border, too.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.620
I don't want to trade
one Syria for another.

28:47.620 --> 28:50.920
We can make a better life
for you here, brother.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.560
I still believe in this place.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.860
(crowd chanting)

28:53.860 --> 28:56.630
(crowd) We want to pray!
We want to pray!

28:56.630 --> 28:59.700
Let us pray! We want to pray!

28:59.700 --> 29:02.030
(crowd cheering)

29:17.820 --> 29:19.820
(footsteps approaching)

29:19.820 --> 29:22.120
(Barry) Whatever it is
you're looking for,

29:22.120 --> 29:23.490
I don't think
it's in there.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.320
No, probably not.

29:31.660 --> 29:33.730
How's Molly?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.810
I don't know. She's, um...

29:39.810 --> 29:42.910
I'm supposed
to give her some space.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.980
I saw the polls. I'm sorry.

29:47.980 --> 29:49.980
(utensils clang)

29:50.420 --> 29:52.780
You don't need
to be nice to me, Bassam.

29:52.790 --> 29:55.390
I know you want
 Fauzi to win.

29:57.260 --> 29:58.660
Bad day?

30:00.630 --> 30:03.360
I'm Jamal's wife.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.300
Apparently, that's a crime
I can never be pardoned for.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.200
- (Leila scoffs)
- Tell me about it.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.970
To some people,
I will always be the American,

30:11.970 --> 30:14.310
the Western infidel.

30:14.310 --> 30:16.240
Doesn't matter
what the truth is.

30:19.780 --> 30:21.850
Do you remember
what it was like?

30:22.880 --> 30:24.220
What?

30:26.190 --> 30:28.690
Before Jamal became...
 Jamal.

30:28.690 --> 30:30.860
Before you went to America.

30:32.790 --> 30:36.130
When we were just... us.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.360
Of course.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.070
What was I like?

30:49.540 --> 30:51.740
You were always laughing.

30:51.740 --> 30:53.550
(laughs)

30:53.550 --> 30:55.980
You were curious.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.550
You used to wake me up
in the middle of the night,

30:58.550 --> 31:00.220
and we'd sneak down 
to the pool.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.550
You remember?

31:02.760 --> 31:04.760
You always wanted
to see who could

31:04.760 --> 31:06.930
hold their breath longer
underwater.

31:06.930 --> 31:09.290
You always lost.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.500
You were fearless.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.680
I met with Daliyah.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.750
She's quite something.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.450
I underestimated her.

31:37.920 --> 31:41.260
She's the kind of woman
a man might fall in love with.

31:41.260 --> 31:44.260
(can cap clatters)

31:46.070 --> 31:47.370
Here.

31:48.630 --> 31:50.470
This is for you.

31:50.470 --> 31:53.640
Peanut butter and jelly
with potato chips.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.240
How very American.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.310
Well, there's only
so much you can do.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.780
We are who we are.

32:22.770 --> 32:24.870
(sighs)

32:34.680 --> 32:35.950
(line ringing)

32:35.950 --> 32:37.580
(clears throat)

32:37.580 --> 32:40.020
This is Molly.
Please leave a message.

32:40.020 --> 32:42.190
Hey, it's me, um...

32:42.190 --> 32:44.990
I know I'm not supposed to call.
You don't have to call me back.

32:44.990 --> 32:47.190
I, um...

32:47.190 --> 32:48.990
There's a lot going on.

32:48.990 --> 32:51.830
And, uh,
and I just wanted to, um...

32:53.000 --> 32:55.630
(clicks tongue) I'm not sure wh...
what I wanted.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.940
Um...

33:00.440 --> 33:03.880
I don't know why, but I was
just thinking about, um...

33:03.880 --> 33:05.880
thinking about that time

33:05.880 --> 33:07.510
we went to that
bed-and-breakfast

33:07.510 --> 33:10.120
before we got married.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.620
We thought
 it would be romantic,

33:12.620 --> 33:14.450
and when we got there,
it was just us

33:14.450 --> 33:17.920
and the weird old couple
that owned the place, and...

33:19.860 --> 33:23.430
The bed was so rickety and loud
that we just...

33:25.670 --> 33:28.300
we just laid there all night,

33:28.300 --> 33:30.970
whispering and...

33:30.970 --> 33:33.040
waiting till we could leave.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.380
Anyway, I... I don't know why
I just thought of that,

33:38.380 --> 33:40.850
but, um...

33:40.850 --> 33:44.020
I'm thinking of you and, uh...

33:44.020 --> 33:47.190
and I hope they're taking
good care of you.

33:47.190 --> 33:49.250
Bye.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.530
The secular government of
Abuddin expects us to yield,

33:59.530 --> 34:03.440
to stand by while they prevent
us from worshipping together,

34:03.440 --> 34:07.770
to stand by while they police
our relationship with God.

34:09.710 --> 34:12.110
But we will not stand by.

34:12.110 --> 34:14.610
(crowd cheering)
We cannot stand by!

34:16.050 --> 34:18.949
Their concern
is violence, hatred.

34:18.949 --> 34:24.020
But if we allow
their oppression to continue...

34:24.020 --> 34:26.460
that's exactly
 what they risk.

34:26.460 --> 34:28.590
Violence and hatred.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.460
(crowd cheering)

34:30.460 --> 34:32.429
We will not yield.

34:32.429 --> 34:34.300
(crowd) We will not yield!

34:34.300 --> 34:36.130
We will not yield.

34:36.139 --> 34:37.870
(crowd) We will not yield!
Get out of the way, huh?

34:37.870 --> 34:39.409
We will not yield.

34:39.409 --> 34:40.370
Watch it.

34:40.370 --> 34:42.210
You're taking up

34:42.210 --> 34:44.340
the entire square
with this bullshit,

34:44.340 --> 34:46.380
and <i> I</i> should watch it?

34:46.380 --> 34:48.210
I need to get to class.

34:48.219 --> 34:50.480
Wouldn't want you to be late
for art history.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.620
Try caring about something
that matters.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.920
Yeah, except this
doesn't matter to me.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.889
All I care about

34:56.889 --> 34:58.160
is being safe.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.530
You're never going
 to be safe.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.160
This is exactly
what I mean.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.430
You people...

35:07.430 --> 35:09.270
you're crazy, you know?

35:09.270 --> 35:12.170
(Al-Qadi) We must hold ourselves
to the highest standard.

35:12.170 --> 35:15.440
Today, we have an opportunity

35:15.440 --> 35:17.980
to show Abuddin...
to show the world...

35:17.980 --> 35:20.980
they are wrong
 to fear us.

35:20.980 --> 35:25.680
Our holy book teaches us
that a true Muslim

35:25.690 --> 35:28.050
is the one that follows
the straight path.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.590
The path of peace.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.430
Of mercy.

35:34.430 --> 35:35.660
Of restraint.

35:35.660 --> 35:38.530
Even when we are tested,

35:38.530 --> 35:42.670
we must not stray
from that path.

35:44.700 --> 35:47.270
I ask you all
to pray with me now.

35:48.840 --> 35:52.210
(man chanting prayer)

35:54.280 --> 35:55.510
I'm going.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.720
What? Why?

35:57.720 --> 35:59.550
He wants us to
pray with him?

35:59.550 --> 36:01.790
We need to do
more than pray

36:01.790 --> 36:03.290
if we want
things to change.

36:03.290 --> 36:04.460
We have to be patient.

36:04.460 --> 36:07.160
They threw you in jail,
beat you up.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.390
You still have a scar.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.690
We're sending a message.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.760
No one is listening, Hanif.

36:14.830 --> 36:16.900
(chanting continues)

36:20.910 --> 36:23.110
(Maloof)<i> I have four of my units</i>

36:23.110 --> 36:25.050
on standby outside
the university,

36:25.050 --> 36:26.550
waiting for me to
give them the go-ahead

36:26.550 --> 36:28.950
- to move to the perimeter of the protest.
- I don't like it.

36:28.950 --> 36:30.750
Troops facing off
against students.

36:30.750 --> 36:33.080
History is not on our side here.
Tahrir Square,

36:33.080 --> 36:34.390
- Tiananmen Square... 
- Don't tie my hands, Mr. President.

36:34.390 --> 36:35.420
I need my troops there

36:35.420 --> 36:37.320
before things get
out of hand, not after.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.420
Ahmed, this is not
a good time.

36:39.430 --> 36:41.660
- I thought maybe I could watch you work. 
- Ahmed.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.760
Please, not now.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.530
Right.

36:45.530 --> 36:46.770
Okay.

36:46.770 --> 36:48.100
I'm sorry.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.440
(Maloof sighs deeply)

36:51.440 --> 36:53.340
(door opens, closes)

36:53.340 --> 36:56.880
Okay, but, Maloof,
make sure your men understand:

36:56.880 --> 37:00.040
no one makes a move
unless there's a direct threat.

37:00.050 --> 37:01.250
Understood.

37:01.250 --> 37:02.180
This gets out of control,

37:02.180 --> 37:05.450
I'm right back
where my brother was.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.590
(sighs)

37:09.590 --> 37:12.460
(man chanting prayer)

37:18.300 --> 37:20.130
Hey, hey.

37:20.130 --> 37:21.400
- Hey.
- What the hell

37:21.400 --> 37:23.270
- are you doing here?
- Nothing.

37:23.270 --> 37:25.100
- I just wanted to see what's going on.
- Are you crazy?

37:25.110 --> 37:26.540
Do you know how dangerous it is
to show up

37:26.540 --> 37:28.110
at a protest
against your own father?

37:28.110 --> 37:29.840
Relax. I have secret service.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.080
- No, we have to go.
- (soldier) To the square!

37:32.080 --> 37:34.480
Over here!
You, come with me!

37:34.480 --> 37:36.780
- Now.
- (soldier) Hurry up, follow them!

37:39.890 --> 37:42.120
(Sammy) Can you let go of me,
 please?

37:42.120 --> 37:43.460
Halima.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.290
All right, knock it off!

37:45.290 --> 37:47.430
You just wander into
 an anti-government protest?

37:47.430 --> 37:47.930
No.

37:47.930 --> 37:49.830
I was in Haitham's office,
we heard shouting,

37:49.830 --> 37:51.760
- so we walked out, okay?
- You call him Haitham now?

37:51.770 --> 37:54.270
Excuse me.
 Professor El-Amin.

37:54.270 --> 37:55.500
I mean, who cares?

37:55.500 --> 37:57.300
What?

37:57.300 --> 37:59.000
Your buttons
 are buttoned wrong.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.310
Are you sleeping with him?

38:03.310 --> 38:04.840
Mind your own business.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.640
He's married, he has a kid.

38:06.650 --> 38:09.810
I really don't need you to be
my conscience right now. Okay?

38:11.080 --> 38:13.350
What if it comes out? Hmm?

38:13.350 --> 38:15.290
Your father's already seen
as a Westerner.

38:15.290 --> 38:17.460
They call him
"The American."

38:17.460 --> 38:19.160
And now people find out
his son is having

38:19.160 --> 38:21.960
a homosexual affair
with a married man.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.600
So are you saying
I can never have

38:23.600 --> 38:25.300
a personal life
 in this place?

38:25.300 --> 38:27.100
Don't do this.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.270
Everything we care about
is too important.

38:32.970 --> 38:35.540
I don't want to have
to tell your father.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.640
You wouldn't do that.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.710
Wouldn't I?

38:49.220 --> 38:51.290
(crowd praying quietly)

38:58.960 --> 39:01.030
(chanting prayer)

39:12.810 --> 39:14.910
We need to be realistic.

39:14.910 --> 39:17.180
You want to be rehabilitated.
It takes time.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.880
The election is
four months away.

39:18.890 --> 39:19.980
Exactly.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.090
And you'll run a good race.

39:21.090 --> 39:24.160
You'll lose,
but you'll lose well.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.860
You'll spend the next four years
as the leader of the opposition.

39:26.860 --> 39:30.230
Not inside the palace,
on the streets.

39:30.230 --> 39:32.230
And when the next
election comes,

39:32.230 --> 39:35.170
it'll be the new you
who runs and wins.

39:35.170 --> 39:37.570
So that's it?
Wait until next time?

39:37.570 --> 39:40.440
Success is about readiness
matched with opportunity.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.610
Just be ready
when your time comes.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.750
(door opens, closes)

39:54.250 --> 39:56.360
I know this isn't
what you wanted.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.690
I haven't lost yet.

39:58.690 --> 40:01.030
Come to dinner tonight.
We can talk it through.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.530
I can't.
I have a meeting.

40:02.530 --> 40:03.530
With whom?

40:03.530 --> 40:05.430
General Cogswell.

40:05.430 --> 40:07.870
At night?

40:07.870 --> 40:09.270
Dressed like that?

40:11.900 --> 40:14.270
I don't need your advice
on my wardrobe.

40:14.270 --> 40:17.210
Don't tell me
that you and he are...

40:17.210 --> 40:18.880
Or my personal life.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.050
Do you know
how dangerous this is?

40:22.380 --> 40:24.050
You were leaving.

40:24.050 --> 40:25.520
Don't let me stop you.

40:31.620 --> 40:34.730
I always thought of you
as many complicated things.

40:34.730 --> 40:36.630
Naive was not one of them.

40:36.630 --> 40:39.030
You really think that,
four months from now,

40:39.030 --> 40:40.260
when Fauzi is President

40:40.270 --> 40:44.300
and you are nothing,
not even Foreign Secretary,

40:44.300 --> 40:46.540
that he will still
be interested in you?

40:53.350 --> 40:55.850
(door opens, closes)

41:03.990 --> 41:06.990

41:06.990 --> 41:08.830
You're a popular
man these days.

41:08.830 --> 41:11.200
I thought you'd
appreciate the privacy.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.770
Isn't it a bit early
to be making overtures?

41:17.770 --> 41:19.540
Not according to the polls.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.310
A lot can happen
 in four months.

41:23.310 --> 41:25.280
Sure.

41:25.280 --> 41:28.210
The sky could fall,
but probably not.

41:28.210 --> 41:31.150
I've spent the last
couple of months

41:31.150 --> 41:35.150
developing a relationship
with the Al Fayeeds.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.560
But the truth is, you're the
man I needed to be talking to.

41:43.030 --> 41:44.430

42:11.890 --> 42:13.460
Take another step.

42:13.460 --> 42:15.390

42:15.400 --> 42:16.460
Stand down.

42:18.830 --> 42:20.500

42:20.500 --> 42:22.570
(crowd clamoring)

42:22.570 --> 42:23.900

42:23.900 --> 42:25.170

42:25.170 --> 42:27.310

42:32.750 --> 42:35.250

I'm saying stop this now!

42:35.250 --> 42:36.750
Stop this now!

42:36.750 --> 42:39.420
They're trying to
make us into martyrs!

42:39.420 --> 42:41.250
We are all willing!

42:42.420 --> 42:44.690
Is that what you think
God wants?

42:44.690 --> 42:45.760
More martyrs?

42:46.160 --> 42:49.560
Paradise is full of martyrs.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.900

is to live here, with us,

42:51.900 --> 42:53.200

42:55.200 --> 42:56.430

43:21.260 --> 43:23.730
We will leave
this square peacefully,

43:23.730 --> 43:25.800
with the promise
to come back tomorrow,

43:25.800 --> 43:29.600
and every day after that,
until the prayers are allowed

43:29.600 --> 43:31.500

43:58.830 --> 44:00.530
Gone to the

44:00.530 --> 44:02.370
He had their attention.
