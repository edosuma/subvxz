<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

02:45.365 --> 02:46.776
<i>Pick up.</i>

02:48.735 --> 02:50.146
<i>Pick up.</i>

03:20.400 --> 03:21.674
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.678
Cornein.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.647
Drink?

03:31.711 --> 03:33.247
No, thank you.

03:42.689 --> 03:43.963
Perfect.

03:45.858 --> 03:47.531
This way.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.839
Slowly.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.493
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

04:55.561 --> 04:56.972
<i>Pick up.</i>

04:59.265 --> 05:00.676
<i>Pick up.</i>

05:03.870 --> 05:05.508
<i>Brandon?</i>

05:09.442 --> 05:13.322
<i>Brandon?</i>

05:16.582 --> 05:18.687
<i>Brandon, where are you?</i>

05:22.021 --> 05:26.026
<i>Brandon? Brandon?</i>

05:28.528 --> 05:32.670
<i>Brandon?</i>

05:40.073 --> 05:41.211
<i>Ugh!</i>

05:44.377 --> 05:47.051
<i>- This is me calling you.</i>

05:50.450 --> 05:53.556
<i>Fuck!</i>

09:11.050 --> 09:13.223
"I find you disgusting."

09:16.989 --> 09:20.698
"I find you inconsolable.
I find you invasive."

09:22.762 --> 09:25.299
This is what the cynics used to say.

09:26.132 --> 09:29.204
Companies would refuse
to look into the future.

09:30.202 --> 09:33.115
They would say, "Can we stop this virus?"

09:33.172 --> 09:35.880
As if it was a negative progression.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.680
But it's growing.

09:40.746 --> 09:45.354
More and more,
with a momentum that is unstoppable.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.260
Now some kid snorts the entire load
of his mother's spice cupboard.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.062
Post that on YouTube.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.795
They would watch
as it becomes the buzz word

09:51.857 --> 09:53.734
amongst high school students everywhere.

09:53.826 --> 09:57.137
Eventually, the cynicism
is turning into awe.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.391
Do you know what's going on
with my computer?

10:24.223 --> 10:25.964
They took it.

10:26.892 --> 10:29.873
Yeah, I know. Someone could have told me.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.038
Some kind of virus.

10:34.867 --> 10:35.902
Cool.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.255
Thank you.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.649
<i>Okay, me again.</i>

12:26.445 --> 12:31.952
<i>I'm dying. I have cancer.
I have one week to live.</i>

12:33.519 --> 12:36.227
<i>The very worst kind of cancer.</i>

12:36.288 --> 12:37.995
<i>Of the vulva...</i>

12:47.399 --> 12:48.935
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.403
You're such a dick.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.572
What are you doing, man?

13:27.740 --> 13:30.346
All right, gentlemen.
If you just please make yourselves at home.

13:30.409 --> 13:32.320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:49.728 --> 13:54.302
<i>It falls upon me as your
beloved boss to propose a toast.</i>

13:54.366 --> 13:55.436
<i>To success.</i>

13:56.735 --> 13:59.272
- I just hope my wife appreciates it.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.976
Get a new tie, please.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.814
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my goodness.

14:05.444 --> 14:08.448
I love women in suits.
I love women in suits.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.922
We could talk business,
I would rearrange my life.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.462
- Wow, she's beautiful.
- Gray suit?

14:12.518 --> 14:14.794
- I'm gonna go talk to her. Count me down.
- You should go talk to her.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.527
Yeah, you should.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.227
Five, four, three, two, one.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.792
Boom.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.429
Have fun.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.134
Twenty bucks says he fucks it up.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.310
Incoming.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.680
Hi, excuse me. Listen, I don't want to
beat around the bush.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.719
I think you're absolutely gorgeous.
My name's David.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.618
- Hi, David. Elizabeth. Nice to meet you.
- Elizabeth. That's a beautiful name.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.179
- Hi, I'm David. I don't mean to be rude.
- Loren.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.453
- Hi, how are you? David. Nice to meet you.
- Rachel.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.994
Listen, can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you all drinks?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.358
- Sure. Why not?
- I would love that.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.159
That would be my pleasure.
What are you guys drinking?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.097
- Well, we were thinking shots.
- You were thinking shots?

14:50.155 --> 14:52.431
We just did shots of tequila.
Would you guys like a shot of tequila?

14:52.524 --> 14:53.798
- Bring it on.
- Love it.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.033
Excuse me. Bartender? Can we get
four shots of your finest tequila?

14:57.129 --> 14:59.131
Thank you very much.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.303
I can see you're very successful.

15:01.367 --> 15:04.405
I think part of the secret to my success
is attention to detail.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.507
- Detail?
- Play the game.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.848
- What game?
- Okay. Blue or green?

15:08.908 --> 15:13.516
I like games. I like this game.
Blue. Green. Green, it's green.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.252
- That's brown.
- Wow, wow!

15:15.314 --> 15:16.850
I don't know how you change
the color of your eyes like that.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.123
How do you do that so quickly?
That's amazing. That's a real talent.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.822
- Detail man.
- Hey, buddy.

15:20.886 --> 15:23.799
This guy, right here,
fucking nailed it today.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.427
I want you to know you fucking nailed it.
You're the man.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.870
Your pitch, amazing.
Listen, we're playing a game here.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.271
Close your eyes again. Blue or green?

15:31.697 --> 15:33.267
- Brown.
- Fuck off.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.437
All right. You, Loren, close your eyes.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.474
- Blue.
- Blue.

15:37.536 --> 15:38.571
- You're just making that up.
- See? He's good.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.378
He's just picking colors randomly.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.545
- You can have his shot.
- Excuse me. We need another shot, please.

15:46.345 --> 15:49.588
- You can put these on me.
- No, I told you, I had it.

15:49.648 --> 15:50.683
No, I have it.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.228
- I'll get the next round.
- Sure.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.059
You're a strong, independent woman.
I like that.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.963
Thank you. Cheers. To nailing it...

15:57.022 --> 15:58.057
- To nailing it.
- To nailing it.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.158
- To nailing it.
- ...and to success.

15:59.224 --> 16:00.225
Yes.

16:02.394 --> 16:03.464
Mmm!

16:03.529 --> 16:04.837
I love that.

16:05.197 --> 16:06.835
Oh, fuck.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.304
Whoa!

16:08.567 --> 16:10.069
So what do you girls do for fun?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.671
Fun? Karate.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.516
You hear this song?
I love this song, I wrote this song,

16:16.575 --> 16:19.852
I would love it if you would dance with me
to this song that I wrote for you.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.483
Come on. Let's go on the dance floor.
One song.

16:22.581 --> 16:25.494
Yeah, come on. You're a fun girl.
It'll be fun.

16:25.551 --> 16:28.191
I'll bring her back. Swear to God.
Come on, come on, it's fun.

16:30.022 --> 16:33.799
<i>Toe to toe Dancing very close</i>

16:34.059 --> 16:35.766
Spinning, spinning, spinning...

16:35.861 --> 16:36.999
Whoo!

16:37.062 --> 16:40.669
I'm grabbing her purse 'cause she's
gonna get robbed and roofied.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.178
- Dance?
- No.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.271
- Are you sure? Okay.
- I'm sure.

16:45.971 --> 16:49.282
<i>Wall to wall</i>

16:49.341 --> 16:53.721
<i>People hypnotized</i>

16:53.779 --> 16:59.354
<i>And they're stepping lightly</i>

16:59.418 --> 17:03.833
<i>Hang each night in</i>

17:03.889 --> 17:07.063
<i>Rapture</i>

17:07.659 --> 17:11.334
Okay, okay, okay! Hold on.
I just gotta talk to you one more time.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.898
Listen, your eyes, they're beautiful.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.272
You know why
I didn't get it right the first time?

17:14.333 --> 17:16.472
Because it's like a collage.
Let me see them again.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.276
Look at those eyes.
I know the color of your eyes!

17:18.337 --> 17:20.510
- David! Come on!
- Come on, we love that game.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.017
That's so much fun.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.781
It's okay, 'cause I'm going this way.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.550
Hey, man, he's going uptown.

17:33.752 --> 17:35.163
Come on.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.837
- Okay.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.619
Hey. Want a ride?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.320
Sure.

19:41.980 --> 19:46.326
<i>I want your love
I want your love</i>

19:50.155 --> 19:53.466
<i>I want your love I want...</i>

19:54.092 --> 19:56.094
- I'll fucking kill you!

19:56.161 --> 19:58.107
What the fuck?

19:58.630 --> 20:01.270
- Ow! Fuck!
- Jesus Christ, Sissy!

20:01.333 --> 20:03.973
Fuck! Brandon, don't you fucking knock?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.947
What the fuck?
Why would I knock? I live here!

20:06.038 --> 20:07.244
Oh, fuck!

20:07.306 --> 20:10.116
- How'd you get in?
- You gave me fucking keys.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.723
Fuck.

20:18.116 --> 20:19.720
You fucking scared me.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.787
Don't I always say call me first
if you're coming into town?

20:21.887 --> 20:24.367
Oh, my God! I called you so many times.

20:27.926 --> 20:29.701
You have a fucking baseball bat?

20:29.761 --> 20:31.331
- Yeah.

20:33.932 --> 20:35.104
Hmm.

20:35.167 --> 20:39.240
What is this shit you put in your hair?
Honestly, it's awful.

20:39.304 --> 20:42.080
- Shampoo.
- Is it for grooming dogs?

20:42.140 --> 20:46.179
<i>I want your love
I want your love</i>

20:47.713 --> 20:49.454
Good to see you.

20:49.648 --> 20:53.061
<i>I want your love
I want your love</i>

20:53.118 --> 20:54.825
- Lock the door next time.
- Yeah.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.093
- Don't use all the towels.
- I won't.

21:50.942 --> 21:52.512
But I want you.

21:54.379 --> 21:57.383
I don't want anyone else.
There is no one else.

21:58.116 --> 22:02.030
I love you. I'll do anything.

22:03.088 --> 22:05.125
I'll do anything.

22:10.595 --> 22:12.472
Please don't say that.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.434
Please don't say that.

22:16.635 --> 22:19.639
I love you. I love you.

22:20.205 --> 22:23.652
I'll do anything. I'll do anything.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.524
I don't have to go out!
I don't have to go out!

22:28.613 --> 22:30.889
I don't even fucking want to go out!

22:30.949 --> 22:34.362
I can stay with you.
I don't care. I don't care.

22:34.419 --> 22:38.458
I don't need anybody else. I love you.

22:38.523 --> 22:43.529
I love you. I love you so much.
I love you, please.

I love you. I love you.

22:46.898 --> 22:48.571
Please.

22:49.434 --> 22:54.076
I feel sick. I feel really sick.

23:03.081 --> 23:04.719
- Morning.
- Morning.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.161
Nice earring. Hot date?

23:11.022 --> 23:13.127
- Juice?
- Mmm!

23:17.996 --> 23:20.101
Will you use a glass?

23:20.165 --> 23:21.906
Sorry.

23:31.777 --> 23:33.586
You're going gray.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.851
Do you think I look fat?

23:42.220 --> 23:44.097
Do you think I look fat?

23:44.156 --> 23:45.931
- Sit down.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.834
Fuck you!

23:55.300 --> 23:57.576
I'm doing a couple gigs.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.513
Yeah. Sure.

24:01.406 --> 24:03.352
Can I stay?

24:05.343 --> 24:08.051
- You want toast?
- Just for a few days?

24:08.113 --> 24:11.094
I'd stay with Mark,
but he's being a fucking asshole.

24:12.083 --> 24:13.824
- Mark?
- Please.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.163
Jesus, Sissy.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.767
What do you expect?

24:22.928 --> 24:25.067
Pretty please?

24:25.163 --> 24:27.336
Look, you get the sofa
and you get your ass off it

24:27.399 --> 24:30.869
- before I leave every morning.
- I will. I promise. I will.

24:30.936 --> 24:33.382
Okay. Okay. Okay.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.846
- We leave in 15.
- Okay!

24:45.584 --> 24:48.190
Mmm! So good!

25:04.069 --> 25:06.242
Stop fucking around.

25:11.776 --> 25:13.449
- Leave it.
- You have fluff.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.583
I like it there.

25:27.726 --> 25:30.866
- How are you for money?
- I'm good.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.772
- 'Cause if you need some money...
- Honestly,

25:32.864 --> 25:35.310
I even make money now and everything.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.974
- Yeah, sure.
- Huge amounts.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.941
- What, you collect it in that hat?

25:44.676 --> 25:46.519
You should come and hear me.

25:47.078 --> 25:49.251
- Yeah, I will.
- "Yeah, I will"?

25:49.314 --> 25:51.624
Like, "Yeah, I will," like last time?

25:55.153 --> 25:56.723
Please come.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.392
Where'd you get this, anyway?

25:58.456 --> 26:00.060
It's vintage.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.264
- Yeah, I can see that.

26:04.796 --> 26:06.605
Wow.

26:06.665 --> 26:08.667
- Do you like?
- Yeah.

26:13.171 --> 26:14.582
Please come.

26:18.143 --> 26:19.679
Okay, I will.

26:22.647 --> 26:24.183
Yay.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.888
Sorry.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.394
Fuck, my computer.

26:33.458 --> 26:35.233
Well, well, well.

26:35.293 --> 26:36.533
Morning, asshole.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.905
Look who's decided to
grace us with his presence.

26:38.964 --> 26:40.068
Yeah.

26:40.131 --> 26:41.633
Don't tell me. No cabs.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.771
No, your wife
wouldn't let me leave this morning.

26:43.835 --> 26:46.338
Hey. That's not cool.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.911
You should be so lucky.

26:50.976 --> 26:54.480
- Any calls?
- Yes. Like, 50.

27:00.218 --> 27:02.061
- Hey! Heads up, buddy.
- Whoa!

27:02.120 --> 27:04.532
So, how'd it go last night?

27:06.925 --> 27:08.871
Got home, went to bed. Good night.

27:08.927 --> 27:10.463
Uh-huh. Right, right.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.273
Let's do it again tonight.
Some place classier, though.

27:14.766 --> 27:16.905
Yeah, my sister's playing
downtown somewhere.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.709
She's playing?

27:18.770 --> 27:21.649
She's a musician. Well, she's a singer.

27:21.706 --> 27:25.244
Okay. Yeah, yeah. You know what?
That sounds like a lot of fun.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.654
And that will ruin your enamel.

27:41.126 --> 27:43.732
That elevator music's
like a bad acid trip.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.832
- Good evening.
- Evening.

27:45.897 --> 27:48.241
Reservation. Sullivan?

27:49.834 --> 27:52.610
Great. I have you on the list.
I'll have you follow me?

27:52.671 --> 27:54.150
Thank you.

27:55.607 --> 27:58.315
- There you are.
- Right this way, please.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.923
Wow, look at that ass.
I could follow that forever.

28:06.384 --> 28:08.227
Nice pick.

28:12.424 --> 28:13.630
Oh!

28:13.958 --> 28:16.666
I forget how beautiful the city is.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.666
Thank you.

28:24.402 --> 28:27.281
Hi, guys. How are you both doing tonight?
What can I get you?

28:27.338 --> 28:30.444
Your accent. Are you... You're from...

28:30.508 --> 28:31.816
Brazil.

28:32.277 --> 28:33.654
Rio? Hmm?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.248
- Sao Paulo
- Oh!

28:35.313 --> 28:37.657
That is a beautiful city. That's...

28:37.716 --> 28:40.526
You've been there?
- Once or twice.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.496
Can we get two dry martinis with olives?

28:42.554 --> 28:43.692
Mmm-hmm.

28:43.755 --> 28:46.793
And a little bit later,
why don't you come by for a drink with us?

28:47.425 --> 28:48.904
I'll make sure I get those drinks.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.371
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

28:51.796 --> 28:54.709
She would be so offended if I didn't try.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.608
Unbelievable.

29:05.443 --> 29:12.418
<i>Start spreading the news</i>

29:18.890 --> 29:24.568
<i>I'm leaving today</i>

29:28.533 --> 29:35.508
<i>I wanna be a part of it</i>

29:38.076 --> 29:40.750

29:41.679 --> 29:47.652

30:17.715 --> 30:22.960

30:26.591 --> 30:33.509

30:38.203 --> 30:45.121

31:05.330 --> 31:12.009
<i>If I can make it there</i>

31:12.904 --> 31:17.182

33:10.588 --> 33:17.528

33:18.696 --> 33:23.111

33:53.564 --> 33:57.740
Wow. Wow! Bravo!

34:00.772 --> 34:03.878
She's good! She's good!

34:10.681 --> 34:11.819
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.453
- I'm David.
- Sissy.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.054
- It is a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet...

34:15.119 --> 34:17.793
I think you are absolutely fantastic
and you look great in the dress, too.

34:17.855 --> 34:20.199
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.933
What did you think?

34:22.994 --> 34:25.804
Yeah, it was interesting.

34:25.862 --> 34:27.433
What do you mean?

34:27.965 --> 34:29.342
No, it was...

34:30.534 --> 34:32.446
It was good. It was good.

34:32.503 --> 34:34.346
It was good?

34:36.274 --> 34:38.754
He was crying. He was crying.
There were tears coming down his face.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.949
I saw it. You made a grown man cry.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.047
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

34:42.112 --> 34:43.524
I'm gonna get some drinks.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.721
That's a great idea. Why don't you
get a round for the table, buddy?

34:51.054 --> 34:53.467
Okay. I'm really sorry about that.

34:53.558 --> 34:56.664
He's had a rough day at work.
I think he's a little bit emotional right now.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:58.262 --> 35:00.742
- So you guys grew up in Jersey?
- Yeah.

35:00.798 --> 35:02.300
- You still live there?
- God, no.

35:02.366 --> 35:04.937
That's good. That's good.
Where do you live now?

35:05.002 --> 35:07.482
- Kind of all over the place.
- Yeah?

35:07.572 --> 35:10.416
- What's the last city you've been to?
- L.A.

35:10.508 --> 35:11.953
- Los Angeles?
- Mmm-hmm.

35:12.009 --> 35:14.216
- Oh, boy. You like it there?
- I mean, I'm going back.

35:14.312 --> 35:17.725
- That must mean you love it then, huh?
- No! I can't even fucking drive.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.455
- Wait a minute. You can't drive?
- It's a nightmare.

35:19.517 --> 35:20.996
- Nope.
- Why not?

35:21.052 --> 35:23.726
I tried when I was a kid
and I was horrible.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.529
Wait, how old were you
when you quit driving?

35:25.590 --> 35:27.399
- Sixteen.
- You were 16 years old?

35:27.458 --> 35:28.596
Mmm-hmm.

35:28.659 --> 35:31.731
So, wait a minute.
How do you get along in Los Angeles?

35:31.829 --> 35:34.207
- I take the bus.
- No. No, no, no.

35:34.265 --> 35:37.371
Look, a girl like you
cannot be taking the bus.

35:37.435 --> 35:39.574
- What happened to your arm here?
- Oh!

35:39.637 --> 35:41.583
When I was a kid, I was bored.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.279
- You must have been really bored.
- I was.

35:44.342 --> 35:46.083
All right, we've got a problem.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.885
Your sister cannot be
taking the bus anywhere, okay?

35:47.945 --> 35:49.424
I know a guy who owns
a car rental company.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.357
We're gonna get you a car,
we're gonna drive around in circles

35:51.415 --> 35:53.258
in a parking lot and you
are going to learn how to drive.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.661
- Not stick, automatic. It's a little easier.
- I would love that.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.324
You'd love that. That's good.
You know what? Better yet,

35:57.388 --> 36:00.801
we're gonna get you a golf cart
and you will drive the golf cart around.

36:00.858 --> 36:03.668
Wow. Now we're talking.
Everybody should drive golf carts.

36:03.728 --> 36:06.572
- A golf cart right up Fifth Avenue, huh?

36:06.631 --> 36:09.407
You know, they should. They should.
It would be a lot cleaner and greener.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.777
It would be great for the city.
Brandon, what do you think?

36:11.836 --> 36:13.577
- Sounds great.
- Yeah?

36:14.972 --> 36:18.351
I love your brother. What an amazing man.

36:20.044 --> 36:21.887
- How long are you here for?
- I don't know.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.619
You don't know?

36:24.515 --> 36:29.931
Can I see you again? Please?
Is that too forward? I find you fascinating.

36:31.322 --> 36:32.995
I really do.
I think you're a fascinating creature.

36:33.057 --> 36:34.502
I'd love to see you again.
Listen, why don't we...

36:34.559 --> 36:36.163
This is a celebration, let's get champagne.

36:36.227 --> 36:37.638
- Yes! Champagne!
- Champagne for everybody.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.073
- The whole table! Come on.
- Champagne.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.625
I've got it, I've got it.
Get out, get out, get out.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.160
Come here, come here, come here.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.596
No!
- Come on, come on with me.

37:02.687 --> 37:04.166
- Get off. Get off.
- How did that work?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.793
- Get off me.
- Come on, come on.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.600
Champagne on your dress, that's...

37:47.698 --> 37:50.838
- Well, I'm hot, I'm hot.
- You are hot.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.650
You are?

38:20.731 --> 38:25.111
- No! You're crushing me.

38:26.570 --> 38:31.178
I need to take this off. I'm hot.
I need to take it off. I'm hot.

38:32.543 --> 38:33.817
Nice sheets.

38:33.878 --> 38:39.191
Aren't they nice sheets?
Bed Bath & Beyond.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.524
Stop.

38:48.826 --> 38:52.273
What if I kiss you right here?

39:02.573 --> 39:04.280
How about here?

39:15.453 --> 39:17.455
- Yeah?
- Shit.

39:21.959 --> 39:24.337
Mmm-hmm.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.435
What?

39:31.602 --> 39:33.809
Stop talking!

42:27.478 --> 42:29.890
I have to be up and out by 7:00.

42:29.947 --> 42:31.949
It's cold.

42:35.252 --> 42:37.459
Sissy, get out of my room.

42:43.260 --> 42:46.002
Sissy, get out of my room.

42:48.098 --> 42:51.272
Get the fuck out! Get out!

43:03.547 --> 43:06.460
Hey, slacker. Your computer's back.

43:25.803 --> 43:27.612
Dave's looking for you.

43:30.808 --> 43:33.311
- Yeah. It was really great last night.
<i>- Daddy, Daddy.</i>

43:33.377 --> 43:35.618
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
Thanks for calling.

43:37.081 --> 43:39.789
Hey, buddy.
Listen, we said an hour French,

43:39.850 --> 43:42.558
and then Isobel’s gonna pick you up
because Mommy's picking up Nathan.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.224
All right? You can go after.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.768
<i>Yeah, I know, but Mommy says I can't.</i>

43:46.824 --> 43:49.270
Okay. Well, let's go talk to Mommy. Hmm?

43:51.095 --> 43:53.598
<i>- She's all the way downstairs.</i>
- Well, go downstairs and tell her

43:53.664 --> 43:56.611
that Daddy said
it's okay for you to go to Jason's.

43:57.768 --> 43:59.543
Huh? Come on. How about that? Do it.

43:59.603 --> 44:01.446
- You can do it. Get up.
<i>- Okay.</i>

44:01.505 --> 44:03.212
Yeah.

44:03.273 --> 44:06.277
<i>Mommy? Mommy?</i>

44:07.811 --> 44:09.256
What's up, man?

44:09.313 --> 44:11.816
- Steven said you wanted to see me.
- Yes.

44:11.882 --> 44:13.862
Dude, 9:00 this morning, where were you?

44:15.519 --> 44:17.294
- Dentist. Root canal.
- Oh, shit.

44:17.388 --> 44:19.664
Now, what did I tell you about that?
Who did you see?

44:19.723 --> 44:23.000
Gary Sher, King's practice,
West 57th Street.

44:23.060 --> 44:26.269
Good. Good. You're stinging
the company health plan, I hope, right?

44:26.330 --> 44:28.276
- Sure.
- That's what it's there for, man.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.970
All right, brother.

44:30.601 --> 44:32.979
Listen, one more thing.

44:35.039 --> 44:37.610
Your hard drive is filthy, all right?
We got your computer back.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.019
I mean, it is dirty.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.750
I'm talking like hoes, sluts, anal,
double anal,

44:43.814 --> 44:45.851
penetration, interracial facial, man.

44:45.916 --> 44:48.487
Cream pie...
I don't even know what that is.

44:52.589 --> 44:55.661
- You think it was your intern?
- On my hard drive?

44:55.726 --> 44:57.831
Yeah, someone's fucking
with your account, man.

44:58.395 --> 45:01.205
And we're blowing our wad in cash,
you know?

45:01.298 --> 45:05.007
It takes a really, really sick fuck to
spend all day on that shit.

45:05.069 --> 45:06.844
<i>Daddy, Daddy.</i>

45:06.904 --> 45:08.906
Yeah. Hey, buddy. What'd she say?

45:08.972 --> 45:12.419
<i>She said I can go to Jason's for a half hour,
but I have to be home by 5:00 for dinner.</i>

45:12.476 --> 45:14.922
Okay. That's great. See?
Best of both worlds.

45:14.978 --> 45:17.652
- You got everything you want. You happy?
<i>- Yup. Yup.</i>

45:17.715 --> 45:21.094
- Yeah. You better be. Get out of here
<i>- Okay. All right, see you.</i>

45:36.967 --> 45:39.971
Hey. You like your sugar?

45:41.305 --> 45:42.943
I do.

47:28.278 --> 47:29.723
Hey.

47:30.380 --> 47:32.257
- Hello.
- Hello.

47:32.316 --> 47:33.989
Did you find it okay?

47:34.051 --> 47:36.588
Yes, I'm glad you made it.

47:37.254 --> 47:38.733
Yeah?

47:40.324 --> 47:44.272
I'm late. Sorry.

47:46.263 --> 47:48.334
You look handsome.

47:48.398 --> 47:50.207
- You look amazing.
- Hi.

47:50.267 --> 47:52.975
- Thank you.
- How are you doing tonight?

47:53.070 --> 47:54.743
- Thank you.
- Okay.

47:54.805 --> 47:58.378
I have a few specials on the menu,
if you'd like to hear them?

47:58.442 --> 47:59.614
Sure.

47:59.676 --> 48:03.886
The soup of the day is tomato
with basil oil and parmesan crostini.

48:04.214 --> 48:08.629
The special is marinated swordfish,
tabouleh and Moroccan charmoula.

48:08.685 --> 48:09.993
It's really good.

48:10.053 --> 48:14.468
We're also serving a DeBragga and Spitler
New York Strip with a side order of fries,

48:14.524 --> 48:18.131
and the salad is snow pea and radish
with a cider vinaigrette.

48:18.996 --> 48:21.943
Can I start you off with a sparkling water?

48:21.999 --> 48:23.501
Tap water's fine.
- Okay.

48:23.567 --> 48:26.343
And the wine menu is right next to...
Yup, there you go.

48:26.403 --> 48:28.178
- You want some wine?
- Sure.

48:28.605 --> 48:32.712
- White? Red?
- Red. Maybe...

48:32.776 --> 48:35.313
Pinot Noir is light,

48:36.179 --> 48:40.821
if you like it, like, light.

48:42.119 --> 48:43.496
Great.

48:43.553 --> 48:45.863
Okay. I'll be back.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.034
- So...

48:54.097 --> 48:55.974
Where do you live?

48:56.033 --> 48:58.536
- Brooklyn.
- Nice.

48:58.602 --> 49:01.776
Born and raised. Where you from?

49:02.205 --> 49:07.018
I was born in Ireland
and we moved here when I was a teen.

49:07.144 --> 49:09.181
Did you get back much? Thank you.

49:09.246 --> 49:10.850
A couple times.

49:11.615 --> 49:13.993
A big family? You miss them?

49:14.284 --> 49:15.456
Uh...

49:15.719 --> 49:17.699
I have a sister.

49:21.325 --> 49:22.702
I have two.

49:22.759 --> 49:24.898
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

49:25.295 --> 49:26.933
Older? Younger?

49:27.030 --> 49:28.634
Older and younger.

49:28.699 --> 49:30.610
I'm right in the middle.

49:36.873 --> 49:38.011
What?

49:38.075 --> 49:40.112
- Just wondering.

49:40.610 --> 49:42.647
Are you nervous?

49:42.713 --> 49:45.421
- Why would I be nervous?
- You look a little nervous.

49:45.482 --> 49:46.859
Do I?

49:47.617 --> 49:49.790
- No.
- Well, what's a date?

49:49.853 --> 49:51.423
It's no big deal.

49:53.323 --> 49:55.826
It took me an hour to
figure out what to wear.

49:57.561 --> 50:00.167
- You chose wisely.
- Yeah.

50:00.430 --> 50:04.674
I'm sorry, but I forgot to say
the crab comes in the shell.

50:05.769 --> 50:07.146
Great.

50:09.439 --> 50:13.148
Oh! Yeah. I haven't even looked at this.

50:13.210 --> 50:15.520
- I'll have the lamb.
- The lamb.

50:15.579 --> 50:17.786
I'll have the lamb, too. That sounds great.

50:17.848 --> 50:20.328
- Okay. No appetizer?

50:21.451 --> 50:23.055
- I'm fine.
- No.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.430
Okay. And how would you like the lamb?

50:25.489 --> 50:27.025
Medium.

50:27.090 --> 50:29.934
We recommend it pretty pink.

50:31.595 --> 50:33.165
- Okay.
- Yeah?

50:33.230 --> 50:36.643
Okay. Pink it is.

50:38.902 --> 50:41.246
Thank you. Excuse me.

50:44.107 --> 50:46.849
So you seeing anyone at the moment?

50:46.910 --> 50:49.186
No, I'm not. Are you seeing anyone?

50:49.980 --> 50:52.460
- No.
- No? Really?

50:54.818 --> 50:57.059
Why is that?

50:57.154 --> 50:59.634
I don't know. It's just the way it is.

50:59.689 --> 51:02.226
It's just the way it is. Yeah, I...

51:02.292 --> 51:06.741
Actually, I'm separated.

51:08.231 --> 51:11.075
- Tragedy.
- Yeah. Kind of a recent thing.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.776
Okay.

51:14.838 --> 51:16.875
You were married for long?

51:18.175 --> 51:21.156
- No.
- Did we decide on the wine?

51:22.045 --> 51:25.652
Well, yeah.
Was it the Pinot Noir, you said?

51:25.715 --> 51:28.389
Yeah, great. Great choice. Okay.

51:30.587 --> 51:34.000
I wasn't married long. Gave it a shot.
It didn't really work out.

51:34.091 --> 51:35.570
No.

51:36.226 --> 51:37.637
- Wow.
- What?

51:37.694 --> 51:40.140
- You just seem, like...
- What?

51:40.197 --> 51:43.144
- Averse to the whole idea.
- Well, yeah.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.908
I just don't understand why
people would want to get married.

51:45.969 --> 51:49.917
Especially nowadays, I mean, it's...
You know?

51:51.007 --> 51:52.543
I don't see the point.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.323
In relationships?

51:55.378 --> 51:57.881
It doesn't seem realistic.

52:02.419 --> 52:05.662
- Are you serious? I mean...
- Yeah. I am, really.

52:05.722 --> 52:10.637
Well, then, you know, why are we here,
if we don't matter to one another?

52:10.694 --> 52:12.867
- Well...
- Why are you here?

52:12.929 --> 52:16.001
The food is supposed to be great here.

52:16.066 --> 52:18.876
No, no, no. I'm not saying it like that.

52:18.935 --> 52:21.279
I mean... I just mean... You know?

52:22.272 --> 52:25.446
One person for the rest of your life?
I mean, it's...

52:26.576 --> 52:30.353
I mean, you come to restaurants,
you see couples sitting together,

52:30.413 --> 52:33.951
and they don't even speak to one another,
they don't have anything to say.

52:34.017 --> 52:37.863
They probably don't have to speak
because they're connected.

52:38.421 --> 52:41.265
Or they're just bored with one another.

52:42.459 --> 52:45.030
- Every...
- Here we go.

52:47.264 --> 52:49.676
What's your longest relationship?

52:50.600 --> 52:51.601
Um...

52:53.803 --> 52:55.373
Exactly.

52:55.438 --> 52:58.180
- That's... You can pour.
- Sure.

53:00.510 --> 53:02.683
Four months.

53:07.217 --> 53:11.063
You have to commit.
You have to actually give it a shot.

53:13.423 --> 53:17.462
I did. For four months.
- For four months.

53:39.249 --> 53:40.956
Thank you.

53:43.253 --> 53:45.392
Look, touch that.

53:46.957 --> 53:47.958
Your head?

53:49.226 --> 53:52.799
- No, no, no.
You're such a weirdo.

53:52.862 --> 53:56.275
No, seriously, seriously, seriously.
Touch it.

53:57.467 --> 53:59.037
Okay.

53:59.102 --> 54:01.480
- Oh, my God.
- Do you feel that?

54:01.538 --> 54:03.017
Yeah, what is it?

54:03.073 --> 54:04.950
- It's a remnant.
- A remnant?

54:05.008 --> 54:07.921
Yeah, from the Neanderthals.

54:07.978 --> 54:10.584
There's only a few of us left
since the Homo sapiens took over.

54:10.647 --> 54:11.648
Okay.

54:11.982 --> 54:13.052
Hmm.

54:13.116 --> 54:15.528
That would explain the forehead.

54:15.585 --> 54:17.587
- What's that supposed to mean?
- "What's that supposed to mean?"

54:17.654 --> 54:19.895
- What do you mean?

54:20.023 --> 54:23.163
Seriously, how did you get it? What is it?

54:23.260 --> 54:25.501
- I used to play this game with my cousin...
- Mmm-hmm.

54:25.562 --> 54:28.805
...where I'd sit on his feet
and he'd fly me through the air.

54:28.865 --> 54:31.846
I hit my head off the ceiling
and I blacked out.

54:31.901 --> 54:34.381
I was knocked out for five or 10 minutes.

54:34.437 --> 54:36.940
- I peed my pants.
- Oh!

54:42.279 --> 54:47.024
If you had a choice to
live in the past or the future,

54:47.083 --> 54:49.222
and you could be
anything you wanted to be,

54:49.286 --> 54:50.959
what would you be?

54:52.455 --> 54:54.196
What would you be?

54:56.493 --> 55:00.339
Well, I always wanted to be
a musician in the '60s.

55:00.397 --> 55:02.809
That's cool. A musician?

55:02.866 --> 55:04.209
Yeah.

55:04.267 --> 55:05.905
'60s is tough, though.

55:05.969 --> 55:10.111
I saw Gimme Shelter recently, you know,
the Rolling Stones documentary?

55:10.173 --> 55:12.449
- Yeah.
- It kind of seemed like hell.

55:12.809 --> 55:13.810
What?

55:13.877 --> 55:17.484
Yeah, the '60s would be, like,
the last place I would want to be.

55:17.547 --> 55:19.549
- No way!
- Yes.

55:20.383 --> 55:22.158
Ugh! Chaos!

55:22.218 --> 55:25.597
So where and what would you wanna be?

55:25.655 --> 55:26.759
Um...

55:28.692 --> 55:31.229
You know, here, now.

55:34.164 --> 55:35.734
That's boring.

55:35.799 --> 55:36.800
Fuck you.

55:47.410 --> 55:50.755
Okay. Well, this is me.

55:50.814 --> 55:53.260
- This is you?
- This is me.

55:55.218 --> 55:57.459
Thank you very much, Brandon.

55:58.221 --> 56:00.633
Thank you very much, Marianne.

56:04.327 --> 56:06.136
We should do this again.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.909
Right.

56:24.581 --> 56:26.618
So is that a yes?

56:28.284 --> 56:30.025
Maybe, yeah.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.676
Hello? Sissy?

57:28.845 --> 57:30.153
Oh, fuck!

57:31.448 --> 57:32.620
Fuck!

57:38.655 --> 57:40.032
Fuck!

57:40.990 --> 57:43.493
- What, are you fucking spying on me?
Lock the fucking door, Brandon.

57:43.560 --> 57:46.006
- Are you fucking spying?
"Are you fucking spying?"

57:46.062 --> 57:48.702
Fuck! Brandon...
- What do you want?

57:48.765 --> 57:50.574
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?

57:50.633 --> 57:52.544
- You wanna fight?
- You want some of this?

57:52.602 --> 57:53.876
What do you want from me?

57:53.937 --> 57:55.211
- What do you want from me?
- Brandon!

57:55.271 --> 57:56.375
- What do you want?
- Get off me!

57:56.439 --> 57:58.715
- Why did you come here? Why?
- Get off me! Get off me!

57:58.775 --> 58:00.345
- Why? Why?
- Get off me!

58:00.410 --> 58:02.913
You're fucking hurting me.
- Talk to me! Fucking bitch!

58:02.979 --> 58:05.323
Get the fuck off, you fucking weirdo.

58:05.381 --> 58:06.985
- Fucking slut!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

58:27.737 --> 58:29.580
Brandon?

58:30.940 --> 58:33.181
Brandon, I'm sorry.

58:50.660 --> 58:53.231
<i>Hey, where's Brandon?</i>

58:54.564 --> 58:56.771
<i>Are you Brandon's girlfriend?</i>

58:57.967 --> 58:59.913
<i>Do you wanna play?</i>

59:01.571 --> 59:03.744
<i>You wanna play with my tits?</i>

59:04.707 --> 59:07.051
<i>I know Brandon would really like it,</i>

59:08.177 --> 59:12.216
<i>and I know exactly what Brandon likes</i>

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.635
Come on.

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:16.941
Where are you taking me?

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.883
Come on. You'll see.

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:22.112
- No, where are we going?
- Come on.

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.526
You want a drink?

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:37.932
What are you looking at?

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.631
This view is amazing.

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.113
Hey.

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.862
Are they vintage?

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.464
A little bit.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.698
- I love it.

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:17.551
Oh, yeah.

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:11.035
Brandon?

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:24.022
You know, it's cool. It's okay.

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:29.763
Should I go?

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.389
Sure.

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.136
I can walk you down.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.540
That's okay.

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:01.479
Can I get you a drink?

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.008
No.

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.888
Fuck.

01:09:13.948 --> 01:09:15.484
Need a hand?

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:18.361
No. The hook's odd.

01:09:21.122 --> 01:09:23.000
There you go.

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:56.028
David?

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.530
Pick up.

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:03.971
I take it you're at your pottery class.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.646
Have you eaten?

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:17.047
No.

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:18.682
Are you hungry?

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.283
No.

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:37.775
Can you just give me a hug?

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:07.804
He's not gonna screw you again.

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:14.444
You left him a message, didn't you?

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.906
You can't help yourself.

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:20.379
It's disgusting.

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:24.347
Why are you so fucking angry?

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.486
Why am I so fucking angry?

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.959
That's my boss.

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:39.772
You sleep with him after 20 minutes.
Now you're calling him up.

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:43.468
What's the matter with you?

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:47.703
You know he's got a family, right?

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:51.548
- You know he's got a family?
- No.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.314
You didn't see
the wedding ring on his finger?

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:55.855
No.

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:57.413
You're a liar.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.023
I'm sorry.

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:08.599
You're always sorry.
That's all you ever fucking say.

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:11.035
Well, at least I say I'm sorry.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.103
Try doing something.

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:17.207
Actions count, not words.

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.143
I'm sorry.

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:23.814
I'm sorry.

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:27.215
I fucked up.

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:32.486
I'm not perfect.
I make mistakes, but I'm trying.

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.953
Some people fuck up all the time.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.100
Look, just forget it.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:51.436
This isn't working out. Obviously.

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:56.176
You need to find somewhere else to live.

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:59.245
I don't have anywhere else to go.

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:06.624
This isn't about him.

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:11.924
I make you angry all the time
and I don't know why.

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:16.695
No. You trap me.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:22.169
You force me into a corner
and you trap me.

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:26.308
"I've got nowhere else to go."

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.973
I mean, what sort of fucking shit is that?

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:30.516
You're my brother.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:34.019
- So what? I'm responsible for you?
- Yes.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.487
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you fucking are.

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:39.492
No, I didn't give birth to you.
I didn't bring you into this world.

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:42.559
You're my brother, I'm your sister.
We're family.

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:44.962
- We're meant to look after each other.
- You're not looking after me.

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.899
- I'm looking after myself.
- I'm trying. I'm trying to help you.

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:51.369
How are you helping me, huh?
How are you helping me?

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:53.530
How are you helping me?

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:57.534
Huh? Look at me. How are you helping me?

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:02.513
You come in here
and you're a weight on me.

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:07.520
Do you understand me? You're a burden.
You're just fucking dragging me down.

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.945
How are you helping me?

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:12.583
You can't even clean up after yourself.

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:16.993
Stop playing the victim.

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:19.589
I'm not playing the fucking victim.

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:23.001
If I left, I would never
hear from you again.

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:25.197
Don't you think that's sad?

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.335
Don't you think that's sad?

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.974
You're my brother.

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:46.117
Why is it always so dramatic with you?
Everything is always the end of the world.

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:49.754
It's not fucking dramatic.
I'm trying to talk to you.

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.693
I don't wanna talk.

01:14:55.824 --> 01:15:00.796
Try not talking. Try just listening
or thinking for a change.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:04.110
Yeah, 'cause that's working great for you.
You're completely fine.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:07.340
- I've got my own fucking apartment.
- Oh, whoopee-fucking shit.

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:09.439
You have your own apartment,
that's amazing.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.917
You have a job and an apartment.
I should be in awe of you.

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.511
Well, at least I'm responsible for it.

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:16.886
At least I don't
depend on people all the time.

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:19.858
- You're a dependency. You're a parasite.
- You don't have anybody.

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:23.020
You don't have anybody. You have me
and your fucking pervert boss.

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:26.089
You slept with that fucking pervert boss.
What does that make you?

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:29.658
Don't talk to me about sex life, Brandon.
Not from you.

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:34.764
Whatever.

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:38.004
I'm going out.

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:39.704
Great. And then you'll come back

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:41.645
and we'll just have
the same fucking conversation again.

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:43.740
No, you'll move out.

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:48.050
And then I'll never hear from you again?

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:05.626
Hey.

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:07.257
Hey.

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:27.148
<i>You wanna get out of here?</i>

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:31.020
I could take you somewhere.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.896
What, are you with someone?

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.770
Does he go down on you?

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.632
I do.

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:53.109
That's what I like to do.

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:42.392
<i>I like the way it feels.</i>

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:46.155
<i>I like the way it's just me and it.</i>

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:53.366
I wanna taste you.

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:57.572
I wanna slip my tongue inside you,

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:02.104
just as you come.

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:13.255
You want me to make you come?

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:19.460
I can do that. Want me to do that?

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.262
What's up, babe?

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:25.737
- I was just getting some drinks.
- Yeah, huh?

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:49.127
Whoa.

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:51.060
Not tonight, buddy.

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:55.768
I said not tonight.

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:11.282
I was just telling
your pretty girlfriend here,

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:14.286
I'd like to fuck her
in that tight pussy of hers.

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:16.413
I mean, bone her real hard.

01:20:16.511 --> 01:20:19.048
- Till she's clawing up my back.
- He's kidding.

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:20.752
This guy's funny.

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:25.999
After I fuck her hard up the ass,

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:29.763
I'll put my balls in her mouth
while I come in her face.

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.662
- You won't let me fuck you in the ass?
- Christ.

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:36.038
- You get to fuck her in the ass?
- You know.

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:38.873
Tell me more, man,
'cause I'm fucking loving this.

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:40.242
- Smell it.
- Yo!

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:42.509
- Jesus, come on.
- You motherfucker.

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:53.919
Hey, Romeo.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.331
<i>Brandon, it's Sissy.</i>

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:24.502
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:28.739
<i>Please, will you pick up the fucking phone?</i>

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:44.186
<i>Brandon, I need you.</i>

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.763
<i>We're not bad people.</i>

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:01.040
<i>We just come from a bad place</i>

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:05.443
<i>Thanks for letting me stay.</i>

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.416
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:40.092
<i>at this time, due to a police investigation,
we have to discharge this train.</i>

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:44.262
<i>Please fallow the conductor to
the rear of the train.</i>

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:46.532
Watch your step between cars.

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.669
Watch your step.

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:51.408
Follow me, please. Follow me.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.379
Watch your step. This way.
This way. Quickly.

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:58.815
This way.
Nothing to see. Move on.

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:00.511
Right this way, please.

01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:10.429
<i>This is Sissy. Leave a message.
Don't if you're an asshole.</i>

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:21.873
<i>- This is Sissy. Leave a...</i>
- Shit!

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:31.752
Shithead.

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:01.738
God!
