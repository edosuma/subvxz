09:06.000 --> 09:09.700
SOCIAL SECURITY FOR THE CHILDRE

09:09.766 --> 09:10.766
CHILDREN.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.933
>> Bill: THE IDEA OF A

09:13.000 --> 09:14.133
UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME,

09:14.200 --> 09:14.900
ANDREW YANG WAS RUNNING FOR

09:14.966 --> 09:16.333
MAYOR IN NEW YORK HE MADE IT A

09:16.400 --> 09:18.566
BIG ISSUE AND THAT WAS HIS

09:18.633 --> 09:19.500
SIGNATURE ISSUE.

09:19.566 --> 09:20.800
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT A LOT MORE

09:20.866 --> 09:23.100
AND I THINK PEOPLE REALIZE EVEN

09:23.166 --> 09:23.700
RICHARD NIXON WAS FOR ITS WAY

09:23.766 --> 09:23.933
BACK --

09:24.000 --> 09:28.166
>> WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE SAYING.

09:28.233 --> 09:29.566
>> Bill: EVEN LIBERAL

09:29.633 --> 09:29.833
SOMETIMES.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.833
>> PREMARCH.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.533
>> Bill: OH.

09:34.600 --> 09:34.900
PRESARAH PALIN.

09:34.966 --> 09:36.733
PREA LOT.

09:36.800 --> 09:40.233
GOOD OLD DAYS.

09:40.300 --> 09:40.500
INSANITY.

09:40.566 --> 09:45.233
BUT THE IDEA THAT IT'S ACTUALLY

09:45.300 --> 09:47.133
CHEAPER AND MORE EFFICIENT THAN

09:47.200 --> 09:49.133
THE WAY WE DO WELFARE NOW.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.833
IT IS WELFARE, OF COURSE BUT

09:50.900 --> 09:53.033
INSTEAD OF SLICING AND DICING

09:53.100 --> 09:54.033
BETWEEN DIFFERENT MARRIED PEOPLE

09:54.100 --> 09:56.100
IN SINGLE PEOPLE, OLD PEOPLE,

09:56.166 --> 09:57.733
YOUNG PEOPLE, JUST ONE BASIC

09:57.800 --> 09:59.466
INCOME IS THAT WHERE YOU ARE?

09:59.533 --> 10:01.200
>> I THINK WE ARE AS CLOSE AS

10:01.266 --> 10:04.333
WE'VE EVER BEEN TO SECURING.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.333
AND WE HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY FOR

10:05.400 --> 10:09.700
SENIOR CITIZENS, THE CHILD TAX

10:09.766 --> 10:10.200
CREDIT FOR FAMILIES WITH

10:10.266 --> 10:12.900
CHILDREN IN THE BEST WAY TO END

10:12.966 --> 10:14.533
POVERTY IN AMERICA TO STIMULATE

10:14.600 --> 10:16.333
THE ECONOMY IS TO PUT MONEY IN

10:16.400 --> 10:18.166
THE POCKETS OF PEOPLE IN NEED.

10:18.233 --> 10:19.866
PEOPLE IN DISTRICTS LIKE MINE

10:19.933 --> 10:22.400
ARE GOING TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS

10:22.466 --> 10:23.800
HOPEFULLY WHICH WOULD NOT ONLY

10:23.866 --> 10:25.400
CREATE INCOME FOR BUSINESSES BUT

10:25.466 --> 10:27.333
FOR THE WORKERS EMPLOYED BY THE

10:27.400 --> 10:27.633
BUSINESSES.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.233
NOT ONLY GOOD MORALS BUT ALSO

10:28.300 --> 10:30.533
GOOD ECONOMICS.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.933
[APPLAUSE]

10:33.000 --> 10:38.400
>> Bill: SO, AS THE FIRST AFRO

10:38.466 --> 10:40.333
LATINO, YOUR WORDS, THAT THE

10:40.400 --> 10:41.000
RIGHTS AND?

10:41.066 --> 10:44.733
>> AFRO LATINO, AFRO LATINX.

10:44.800 --> 10:45.233
INTERSECTING IDENTITIES.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.566
>> Bill: I KNOW THE WORDS.

10:48.633 --> 10:51.400
>> I'VE TO PAY MORE DUES TO

10:51.466 --> 10:52.666
CONGRESS BECAUSE OF MY

10:52.733 --> 10:52.966
IDENTITIES.

10:53.033 --> 10:53.766
>> Bill: EASY TO GET THE WORDS

10:53.833 --> 10:53.966
WRONG.

10:54.033 --> 10:57.600
>> LESS EXPENSIVE TO BE A WHITE

10:57.666 --> 10:58.666
MAIL IN CONGRESS, I CAN TELL

10:58.733 --> 10:58.833
YOU.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.233
>> Bill: INTERESTING.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.366
BUT YOU CAN BE INSUFFERABLY WOKE

11:04.433 --> 11:06.800
AND I THINK YOU ARE JUST

11:06.866 --> 11:07.433
PERFECTLY INSANE.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.466
AND AN OLD-SCHOOL LIBERAL.

11:11.533 --> 11:11.733
YOU KNOW.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.733
[APPLAUSE]

11:15.800 --> 11:17.700
LIKE YOU, YOU WANT POLICE REFORM

11:17.766 --> 11:19.133
AS I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE

11:19.200 --> 11:20.600
NEEDS TO BE SOME BUT YOU'RE NOT

11:20.666 --> 11:21.500
FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE WHICH A

11:21.566 --> 11:24.600
LOT OF YOUR PARTY TALK ABOUT

11:24.666 --> 11:25.266
ABOLISHING THE POLICE.

11:25.333 --> 11:28.066
THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU ARE.

11:28.133 --> 11:31.133
>> PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE

11:31.200 --> 11:32.533
McAULEY'S DROPOUT IN GEORGE

11:32.600 --> 11:35.433
ORWELL SAID THAT THERE IS ONLY

11:35.500 --> 11:36.166
SOME IDEAS THAT ARE SO STUPID

11:36.233 --> 11:37.966
THAT ONLY INTELLECTUALS CAN

11:38.033 --> 11:38.866
BELIEVE THEM.

11:38.933 --> 11:40.533
I'M AN ORGANIZER WITH MY FEET

11:40.600 --> 11:41.133
PLANTED IN THE GROUND AND I

11:41.200 --> 11:42.333
RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE IN THE

11:42.400 --> 11:43.200
SOUTH BRONX.

11:43.266 --> 11:45.800
THE PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH BRONX

11:45.866 --> 11:46.566
LIKE MOST RANK-AND-FILE

11:46.633 --> 11:47.533
DEMOCRATS ARE PRACTICAL NOT

11:47.600 --> 11:48.633
IDEOLOGICAL AND WANT TO FOCUS ON

11:48.700 --> 11:49.833
THE BREAD-AND-BUTTER ISSUES OF

11:49.900 --> 11:50.766
HEALTH AND HOUSING, SCHOOLS AND

11:50.833 --> 11:52.766
JOBS AND THAT'S WHERE MY FOCUS

11:52.833 --> 11:53.200
LIES.

11:53.266 --> 11:57.700
>> Bill: AND THE POLICE?

11:57.766 --> 11:59.500
>> PEOPLE WANT IS TRANSPARENT

11:59.566 --> 12:01.533
AND ACCOUNTABLE AND

12:01.600 --> 12:03.066
CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.466
THE CENTRAL CHALLENGE AFFECTING

12:04.533 --> 12:06.566
AMERICAN POLICING IS A LACK OF

12:06.633 --> 12:08.300
ACCOUNTABILITY.

12:08.366 --> 12:09.733
RARELY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

12:09.800 --> 12:11.000
ABUSING THEIR POWER AND PART OF

12:11.066 --> 12:12.666
THE PROBLEM IS CULTURE, THE BLUE

12:12.733 --> 12:13.466
WALL OF SILENCE.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.566
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE

12:15.633 --> 12:16.566
DOCTRINE OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY

12:16.633 --> 12:18.133
AND IT'S BECOME A LICENSE FOR

12:18.200 --> 12:19.333
POLICE OFFICERS TO ABUSE THEIR

12:19.400 --> 12:21.800
POWER WITH IMPUNITY WHICH IS WHY

12:21.866 --> 12:23.666
SUPPORT THE GEORGE FLOYD JUSTICE

12:23.733 --> 12:26.333
WHICH WOULD ABOLISH THE

12:26.400 --> 12:26.600
DOCTRINE.

12:26.666 --> 12:30.733
>> Bill: OKAY.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.500
THE OTHER WAY I THINK YOU'VE

12:32.566 --> 12:34.966
BEEN INCREDIBLY GUTSY IS ISRAEL.

12:35.033 --> 12:36.500
IT'S INTERESTING TALKING ABOUT

12:36.566 --> 12:38.566
THE POLICE, SOMEHOW THE ISRAELI

12:38.633 --> 12:39.633
WAR THAT WE JUST HAD GOT

12:39.700 --> 12:42.633
CONFLATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AMONG

12:42.700 --> 12:43.266
THE WOKE WHO ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY

12:43.333 --> 12:47.066
FELL ASLEEP DURING HISTORY CLAS

12:47.133 --> 12:49.533
CLASS.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.233
WITH OUR RACIAL PROBLEMS HERE IN

12:51.300 --> 12:53.200
AMERICA, I JUST WANT TO SAY KIDS

12:53.266 --> 12:53.833
WHAT'S GOING ON IN ISRAEL HAS

12:53.900 --> 12:58.566
NOTHING TO DO WITH GEORGE FLOYD,

12:58.633 --> 12:59.900
NOT ABOUT RACISM LESS THAN THEY

12:59.966 --> 13:00.933
WOULD KNOW THIS, LESS THAN HALF

13:01.000 --> 13:04.900
OF ISRAELIS ARE WHITE.

13:04.966 --> 13:06.633
THE REASON WHY THEY ARE BOMBING

13:06.700 --> 13:08.233
BUILDINGS IS NOT TO BECAUSE THEY

13:08.300 --> 13:10.466
ARE RACISTS, IT IS BECAUSE THERE

13:10.533 --> 13:12.633
IS ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN THE

13:12.700 --> 13:14.300
BUILDINGS.

13:14.366 --> 13:15.533
I THINK YOU ARE THE ONLY

13:15.600 --> 13:17.466
DEMOCRAT WHO HAS BEEN

13:17.533 --> 13:21.333
FORTHRIGHTLY STANDING WITH THE

13:21.400 --> 13:23.133
COUNTRY THAT SEEMS TO BE MORE

13:23.200 --> 13:26.500
ALIGNED WITH OUR LIBERAL VALUES.

13:26.566 --> 13:29.833
>> YOU KNOW, FOR ME, THE

13:29.900 --> 13:30.900
PROGRESSIVE POSITION IS THE

13:30.966 --> 13:32.700
COEXISTENCE OF A JEWISH STATE IN

13:32.766 --> 13:35.366
A PALESTINIAN STATE, NOT THE

13:35.433 --> 13:36.000
EXCLUSION EXISTENCE OF ONE TO

13:36.066 --> 13:36.966
THE EXCLUSION OF OTHERS.

13:37.033 --> 13:40.033
FOR ME, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE --

13:40.100 --> 13:43.566
[APPLAUSE]

13:43.633 --> 13:46.433
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

13:46.500 --> 13:48.266
PROMOTING PEACE AND INCITING

13:48.333 --> 13:48.500
HATRED.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.900
IN MOST OF THE WORDS AND IDEAS

13:50.966 --> 13:52.600
AND MEMES I'VE SEEN AMPLIFIED ON

13:52.666 --> 13:54.733
TWITTER ARE AIMED AT INCITING

13:54.800 --> 13:56.433
HATRED FOR ISRAEL RATHER THAN

13:56.500 --> 13:57.000
PROMOTING PEACE BETWEEN THE

13:57.066 --> 13:59.200
ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS.

13:59.266 --> 14:01.266
MY CONCERN IS THAT THE

14:01.333 --> 14:03.366
HYSTERICAL DEMONIZATION OF

14:03.433 --> 14:05.700
ISRAEL HAS SET OFF A GLOBAL WAY

14:05.766 --> 14:07.166
OF ANTI-SEMITIC VIOLENCE AND

14:07.233 --> 14:08.100
VITRIOL AND HATES NEVER GOING TO

14:08.166 --> 14:08.466
BRING US PEACE.

14:08.533 --> 14:11.400
IT WILL ONLY BRING MORE VIOLENCE

14:11.466 --> 14:12.400
AND THAT'S MY BASIC CONCERN.

14:12.466 --> 14:12.666
[APPLAUSE]

14:12.733 --> 14:14.800
>> Bill: WRITES, --

14:14.866 --> 14:16.800
>> TO YOUR POINT, THERE IS A

14:16.866 --> 14:18.933
WRITER, MATTIE FRIEDMAN WHO

14:19.000 --> 14:20.800
WARNS AGAINST THE DANGER OF

14:20.866 --> 14:23.333
AMERICANIZING THE

14:23.400 --> 14:23.966
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONCEPT OF

14:24.033 --> 14:24.266
MY CONFLICT.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.900
IF WE THINK WE ARE THE CENTER OF

14:25.966 --> 14:27.700
THE UNIVERSE AND TEND TO APPLY

14:27.766 --> 14:28.566
UN-AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE WHERE

14:28.633 --> 14:29.966
DOESN'T BELONG.

14:30.033 --> 14:32.033
THIS IS NOT A BLACK AND WHITE

14:32.100 --> 14:34.766
CONFLICT AS YOU SAY AS YOU SAID

14:34.833 --> 14:37.733
20% OF THE POPULATION CONSIST OF

14:37.800 --> 14:44.400
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN'S AND FROM

14:44.466 --> 14:48.100
THE MIDDLE EAST, WHO ARE SPANISH

14:48.166 --> 14:50.266
JEWS, THIS IS NOT A

14:50.333 --> 14:52.233
BLACK-AND-WHITE CONFLICT.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.733
>> Bill: ONLY ABOUT 44% OF THE

14:53.800 --> 14:58.166
ISRAELIS LOOK LIKE YOUR DENTIST.

14:58.233 --> 15:00.666
[LAUGHTER]

15:00.733 --> 15:03.100
>> BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT

15:03.166 --> 15:05.300
TO REDUCE EVERYTHING TO END OF

15:05.366 --> 15:09.733
OUR OVERARCHING NARRATIVE THAT Y

15:09.800 --> 15:11.733
CONFLICT HAS ITS OWN HISTORY,

15:11.800 --> 15:13.133
ITS OWN PARTICULARITY, ITS OWN

15:13.200 --> 15:13.966
COMPLEXITY AND NONE OF THAT

15:14.033 --> 15:17.700
SHOULD BE AT WAR IN FAVOR OF THE

15:17.766 --> 15:18.233
OVERARCHING IDEOLOGY THAT

15:18.300 --> 15:22.900
PURPORTS TO EXPLAIN.

15:22.966 --> 15:23.466
>> Bill: WHAT BOTHERED ME SO

15:23.533 --> 15:26.666
MUCH ABOUT IT, AMONG OTHER

15:26.733 --> 15:27.866
THINGS, IS THAT IT SEEM LIKE THE

15:27.933 --> 15:29.300
PROGRESSIVES ARE THE PEOPLE WHO

15:29.366 --> 15:31.133
THINK THEY ARE PROGRESSIVE, HAVE

15:31.200 --> 15:33.666
ALIGNED THEMSELVES WITH THE

15:33.733 --> 15:37.233
POLICE GAZA, THE WORLD BETWEEN

15:37.300 --> 15:41.133
ISRAEL AND PALESTINIAN, GAZA IS

15:41.200 --> 15:44.233
A THEOCRATIC STATE.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.166
THEY HAVE NO DEMOCRACY, HAVEN'T

15:47.233 --> 15:49.366
HAD AN ELECTION SINCE 2006, THEY

15:49.433 --> 15:50.133
WILL NEVER GIVE UP POWER AND

15:50.200 --> 15:52.266
THEY RUN LIKE A MAFIA.

15:52.333 --> 15:56.700
IT'S KIND OF A THUG-AUTOCRACY.

15:56.766 --> 16:01.766
WOMEN ARE TRE THE MIKE MORRIS LN

16:01.833 --> 16:02.000
PORN

16:02.066 --> 16:07.633
I THINK WE ARE ON THE SAME.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.000
I WONDER WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE

16:09.066 --> 16:11.000
AND WHY HOW PROGRESSIVES, THEY

16:11.066 --> 16:13.966
HAVE HONOR KILLINGS THERE.

16:14.033 --> 16:14.533
HOW COULD PROGRESSIVES HAVE

16:14.600 --> 16:18.033
GOTTEN INTO THEIR HEAD NODS IN

16:18.100 --> 16:21.366
RECENT HISTORY, BUT THE LAST 15

16:21.433 --> 16:22.666
OR 20 YEARS WE HAVE SEEN THIS

16:22.733 --> 16:25.266
WITH THESE KINDS OF VALUES

16:25.333 --> 16:28.066
THAT ARE NOT LIBERAL VALUES.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.833
>> IT'S IT INEXPLICABLE TO ME

16:29.900 --> 16:33.100
THAT ISRAEL IS HELD TO AND I

16:33.166 --> 16:33.900
ASKED PEOPLE, ASK YOURSELF A

16:33.966 --> 16:35.633
SIMPLE QUESTION IF YOU AND YOUR

16:35.700 --> 16:39.300
NEIGHBORS WERE THE TARGETS OF

16:39.366 --> 16:40.833
4,000 ROCKETS WILL BE EXPECTED

16:40.900 --> 16:41.233
GOVERNMENT TO DO?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.133
WOULD YOU EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT

16:43.200 --> 16:43.466
TO DO NOTHING?

16:43.533 --> 16:47.100
HAVING SAID THAT, ONCE

16:47.166 --> 16:48.000
HOSTILITIES BREAKOUTS, IT IS

16:48.066 --> 16:49.600
CRITICAL FOR A THIRD PARTY LIKE

16:49.666 --> 16:51.566
THE UNITED STATES TO IMMEDIATELY

16:51.633 --> 16:52.133
INTERVENE AND NEGOTIATE AND

16:52.200 --> 16:55.100
CEASE FIRE A AN END THE BLOODSH.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.500
IT LIKE YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY,

16:56.566 --> 16:59.333
THERE IS NO WINNERS IN WAR AND

16:59.400 --> 16:59.933
EVERYBODY LOSES AMONG THE

17:00.000 --> 17:00.866
WRETCHEDNESS OF WAR BUT I FEEL

17:00.933 --> 17:02.066
LIKE I'M SURREAL IS HELD TO A

17:02.133 --> 17:03.866
DOUBLE STAND IN AND THERE'S AN

17:03.933 --> 17:06.633
UNDERCURRENT OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN

17:06.700 --> 17:08.733
THE DISPROPORTIONATE SCRUTINY OF

17:08.800 --> 17:09.333
ISRAEL.

17:09.400 --> 17:09.833
>> Bill: CONGRESSMAN, I

17:09.900 --> 17:12.066
APPRECIATE YOUR GUTS.

17:12.133 --> 17:13.233
I HOPE YOU COME BACK AND VISIT

17:13.300 --> 17:14.933
US SOON.

17:15.033 --> 17:16.566
AS HE WAS SENT UP THE LADDER IN

17:16.633 --> 17:18.100
POLITICS WHICH I KNOW YOU WILL.

17:18.166 --> 17:18.966
THANK YOU.

17:19.033 --> 17:27.133
LET'S MEET OUR PANEL.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.466
HEY!

17:29.533 --> 17:30.300
HEY, GUYS.

17:30.366 --> 17:30.766
OKAY.

17:30.833 --> 17:31.033
WASH BACK

17:31.100 --> 17:31.766
HE WAS THE HOST OF MSNBC'S

17:31.833 --> 17:32.400
"HARDBALL" FOR 20 YEARS AND HIS

17:32.466 --> 17:32.800
NEW BOOK IS CALLED

17:32.866 --> 17:33.300
"THIS COUNTRY: MY LIFE IN

17:33.366 --> 17:33.766
POLITICS AND HISTORY."

17:33.833 --> 17:39.433
CHRIS MATTHEWS.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.466
HE IS OVER HERE.

17:41.533 --> 17:42.133
HE'S THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF OHIO

17:42.200 --> 17:43.466
WHO IS NOW SENIOR COMMENTATOR

17:43.533 --> 17:47.633
FOR CNN.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.166
YOU KNOW JOHN KASICH!

17:49.233 --> 17:49.666
OKAY, JOHN!

17:49.733 --> 17:52.566
GOOD TO HAVE YOU GUYS HERE.

17:52.633 --> 17:54.566
IT'S LIKE AN OLD-SCHOOL HARDBALL

17:54.633 --> 17:56.300
EPISODE, IS IN THERE?

17:56.366 --> 17:57.233
I MUST START WITH MIKE PENCE

17:57.300 --> 17:58.700
TODAY CAME OUT OF HIDING AND HE

17:58.766 --> 18:02.866
SAID HE STILL SUPPORTS TRUMP.

18:02.933 --> 18:04.766
AND HE WON'T "LET THE MEDIA USE

18:04.833 --> 18:09.533
ONE TRAGIC DAY TO DISCREDIT THE

18:09.600 --> 18:11.466
ASPIRATIONS OF MILLIONS OF

18:11.533 --> 18:13.033
AMERICANS WHICH WERE TO KILL

18:13.100 --> 18:13.200
HIM.

18:13.266 --> 18:16.866
THOSE QUOTE [LAUGHTER]

18:16.933 --> 18:20.033
I CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.333
HE SAID HE AND TRUMP WILL NEVER

18:21.400 --> 18:22.466
SEE EYE TO EYE ON THE CAPITAL

18:22.533 --> 18:25.366
RIOTS ON JANUARY 6TH WHICH IS

18:25.433 --> 18:27.733
THAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF US.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.000
YOU KNOW.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.500
YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH SOMEBODY

18:29.566 --> 18:31.066
BUT THERE'S THIS LINGERING

18:31.133 --> 18:31.966
AWKWARDNESS BECAUSE THEY WANTED

18:32.033 --> 18:35.066
TO KILL YOU BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T

18:35.133 --> 18:37.100
HELP THEM OVERTHROW THE

18:37.166 --> 18:39.800
GOVERNMENT.

18:39.866 --> 18:42.333
SO, I --

18:42.400 --> 18:45.100
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

18:45.166 --> 18:46.133
SIN TRUMP HAS SORT OF WENT AWAY,

18:46.200 --> 18:48.500
BUT I DON'T LIKE YOU WENT AWAY

18:48.566 --> 18:50.233
REALLY, A LOT OF PEOPLE

18:50.300 --> 18:51.600
HAVE SAID ONCE HE'S GONE BY THEN

18:51.666 --> 18:53.333
SAID IT TOO, ONCE HE'S GONE YOU

18:53.400 --> 18:55.966
WILL SEE THE REPUBLICANS CHANGE

18:56.033 --> 18:57.666
BACK AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED.

18:57.733 --> 18:59.133
JOHN, YOU SAID THAT THERE IS A

18:59.200 --> 19:00.000
FEVER AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

19:00.066 --> 19:01.966
AND IT WOULD BREAK.

19:02.033 --> 19:04.700
IT'S NOT A FEVER, IT'S A TUMOR.

19:04.766 --> 19:07.000
FEVERS BREAK, THIS JUST SEEMS TO

19:07.066 --> 19:09.733
BE GETTING WORSE.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.133
>> YEAH, I THINK I'M A BILL,

19:11.200 --> 19:12.233
IT'S NOT GOING TO GET BETTER

19:12.300 --> 19:15.833
UNTIL WE HAVE A NOMINEE FOR

19:15.900 --> 19:17.033
PRESIDENT AND THEN WE HAVE TO

19:17.100 --> 19:19.033
SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL

19:19.100 --> 19:19.900
HAVE A NORMAL AGENDA.

19:19.966 --> 19:21.733
BELIEVE IT OR NOT I THINK IT IS

19:21.800 --> 19:22.300
LIKELY.

19:22.366 --> 19:23.633
I THINK CHRIS MIGHT AGREE THAT

19:23.700 --> 19:24.400
THE REPUBLICANS COULD ACTUALLY

19:24.466 --> 19:25.700
WIN BACK THE HOUSE WITH NO

19:25.766 --> 19:27.566
AGENDA WHATSOEVER.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.700
RELYING ON THINGS LIKE ATTACKING

19:30.766 --> 19:32.600
THE DEMOCRATS FOR DISMISSING

19:32.666 --> 19:33.700
MR. POTATO HEAD AND STUPID

19:33.766 --> 19:34.133
THINGS LIKE THAT.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.133
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.766
IF THERE IS NO PLAN ON

19:36.833 --> 19:37.733
PRESCRIPTION GLOVES, NO PLAN ON

19:37.800 --> 19:39.466
WHAT WE DO WITH ENTITLEMENTS, NO

19:39.533 --> 19:41.033
PLAN ON WHAT WE DO WITH

19:41.100 --> 19:42.133
IMMIGRATION, THERE IS NO PLANS

19:42.200 --> 19:43.333
AT ALL AND THEY'RE USING

19:43.400 --> 19:44.833
CULTURAL ISSUES TO TRY TO WIN

19:44.900 --> 19:46.366
BACK THE MAJORITY BECAUSE IT'S

19:46.433 --> 19:47.766
ALL ABOUT POWER.

19:47.833 --> 19:48.433
WASHINGTON NOW IS ABOUT POWER

19:48.500 --> 19:51.066
AND I WANT TO BE IN AND I WANT

19:51.133 --> 19:52.433
YOU OUT AND IT'S A TRAGEDY.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.366
IT HAS TO FIX ITSELF OR THE

19:53.433 --> 19:55.933
PARTY I THINK OVER TIME WILL

19:56.000 --> 20:00.033
BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.166
>> Bill: CULTURAL ISSUES, THAT

20:02.233 --> 20:03.500
WAS 10 OR 20 YEARS AGO, THEY EAT

20:03.566 --> 20:05.800
BABIES AND THAT'S A CULTURAL

20:05.866 --> 20:06.066
ISSUE?

20:06.133 --> 20:08.333
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.900
THIS IS WHY NOTHING CAN GET

20:09.966 --> 20:10.100
DONE.

20:10.166 --> 20:12.900
WHY WE ARE STUCK.

20:12.966 --> 20:14.666
I MEAN, BIDEN WANTS AN

20:14.733 --> 20:16.833
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, HE KEEPS

20:16.900 --> 20:20.100
LOWERING THE NUMBER, IT WAS

20:20.166 --> 20:23.700
1.7 TRILLION -- OR 2.3 TRILLION,

20:23.766 --> 20:24.333
NO 1.7 TRILLION NOW AND EVEN

20:24.400 --> 20:26.000
TRILLION, IT'S LIKE I'M A

20:26.066 --> 20:28.066
CHARMING HE THINKS IT IS ABOUT

20:28.133 --> 20:30.033
MONEY.

20:30.100 --> 20:33.766
HTHEY THINK HE'S A SATANIC

20:33.833 --> 20:34.400
PEDOPHILE.

20:34.466 --> 20:35.466
>> I DIDN'T SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP

20:35.533 --> 20:38.566
FROM THE BEGINNING AND I'VE BEEN

20:38.633 --> 20:39.766
AGAINST HIM ALL ALONG.

20:39.833 --> 20:41.466
I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND IN WHAT

20:41.533 --> 20:42.200
I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE NOT

20:42.266 --> 20:43.500
DOING AND WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE

20:43.566 --> 20:46.166
DOING AND THEY HAVE NO AGENDA.

20:46.233 --> 20:47.033
IT IS A TRAGEDY.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.900
>> Bill: WHEN SHOULD DEMOCRATS

20:48.966 --> 20:49.733
BE DOING?

20:49.800 --> 20:51.500
CHRIS, YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT.

20:51.566 --> 20:52.600
IF BIDEN SAID MEMORIAL DAY

20:52.666 --> 20:54.433
DEMOCRACY ITSELF IS IMPERILED.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.600
WE ARE DOING WHAT'S?

20:57.666 --> 20:59.000
>> IT IS IMPERILED.

20:59.066 --> 21:05.633
THIS IS REAL AND IT'S INVASIVE

21:05.700 --> 21:07.333
OF A BODY STATURE LIKE A GUY

21:07.400 --> 21:08.833
LIKE MIKE PENCE, WHAT HAPPENED?

21:08.900 --> 21:12.533
THEY DON'T SPEAK ABOUT LOGIC.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.266
REALPOLITIK STATE FIGHT OVER

21:13.333 --> 21:13.866
INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE HILL AND

21:13.933 --> 21:18.566
WHAT I DO IS CALL THE CHIEF

21:18.633 --> 21:19.200
ENGINEER, THE LOCAL REPUBLICAN

21:19.266 --> 21:21.500
LEADER AND AS COMPANY BRIDGES

21:21.566 --> 21:22.000
ARE BELOW SAFETY CODE.

21:22.066 --> 21:25.700
I WANT THE LIST.

21:25.766 --> 21:26.866
BEFORE THE HOUSE THEY GO AND

21:26.933 --> 21:28.466
LIST THE DANGEROUS BRIDGES IN

21:28.533 --> 21:29.266
THE REPUBLICAN LEADERS DISTRICT

21:29.333 --> 21:30.466
AND THE SCHOOL BUS GOES OVER WHO

21:30.533 --> 21:31.800
KNOWS OF THE SCHOOL BUS WILL

21:31.866 --> 21:33.300
MAKE IT.

21:33.366 --> 21:34.833
THOSE KIND OF ARGUMENT SEEMS TO

21:34.900 --> 21:36.400
BE A GOOD AGGRESSIVE DEMOCRATIC

21:36.466 --> 21:37.333
AND REPUBLICAN POLITICS, YOU

21:37.400 --> 21:38.433
TAKE THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY AND

21:38.500 --> 21:39.500
YOU TAKE IT TO HIS OWN TURF AND

21:39.566 --> 21:42.466
YOU BEAT HIM ON IT AND SCARE THE

21:42.533 --> 21:42.833
HELL OUT OF HIM.

21:42.900 --> 21:43.933
I DON'T THINK THE CROWD CARES.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.700
I THINK YOU GET A HOTEL IN THE

21:46.766 --> 21:48.033
DISTRICT, THEY PULL OUT A SAFETY

21:48.100 --> 21:49.533
CODE IN EVERY THING IS FALLING

21:49.600 --> 21:51.300
APART, IT'S ALL GOING TO, AND I

21:51.366 --> 21:53.466
GO, OH, YEAH, I'M WITH

21:53.533 --> 21:53.800
DONALD TRUMP.

21:53.866 --> 21:57.333
>> Bill: EXACTLY.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.200
>> BILL, I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE

21:58.266 --> 22:02.000
BUDGET COMMITTEE.

22:02.066 --> 22:03.066
NEGOTIATED WITH THE CLINTON

22:03.133 --> 22:03.900
ADMINISTRATION TO GET US TO A

22:03.966 --> 22:04.733
BALANCED BUDGET AND WAS A

22:04.800 --> 22:07.400
DIFFERENT TIME BUT TODAY, WE ARE

22:07.466 --> 22:09.666
ALL IN TRIBES AND THERE'S TWO

22:09.733 --> 22:10.500
PARTIES AND TRIBAL POLITICS.

22:10.566 --> 22:12.133
YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

22:12.200 --> 22:12.500
COUNTRY?

22:12.566 --> 22:14.266
WE LIVE IN AND I CULTURE TODAY,

22:14.333 --> 22:15.666
IT'S ALL ABOUT ME, IT'S ALL

22:15.733 --> 22:17.400
ABOUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME AND NO

22:17.466 --> 22:18.900
LONGER ABOUT A WEEK CULTURE

22:18.966 --> 22:20.500
WHERE WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED

22:20.566 --> 22:22.533
ABOUT EVERYBODY WHO IS THE

22:22.600 --> 22:22.800
AUDIENCE.

22:22.866 --> 22:24.166
WE HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT

22:24.233 --> 22:25.033
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON AND

22:25.100 --> 22:27.000
MAYBE THEY ARE RIGHT.

22:27.066 --> 22:29.666
POLITICS IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE

22:29.733 --> 22:31.100
LIFE OF OTHER PEOPLE.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.500
IF YOU ARE NOT DEDICATED TO

22:32.566 --> 22:33.600
THAT, YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN IT.

22:33.666 --> 22:35.533
IT'S NOT ABOUT POWER.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.900
>> Bill: BUT IT IS.

22:37.966 --> 22:40.166
>> BILL, WE LIVE IN A LIFE OF

22:40.233 --> 22:41.700
COMPROMISE, WE ARE ALL MARRIED,

22:41.766 --> 22:43.700
LIFE IS COMPROMISE.

22:43.766 --> 22:45.833
>> Bill: NOT ALL OF US!

22:45.900 --> 22:48.766
>> YOU WON'T GET CAUGHT THERE.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.833
BUT THERE IS SUCH OF A THING AS

22:50.900 --> 22:52.200
A FACT AND DONALD TRUMP DID OKAY

22:52.266 --> 22:55.733
IN THE LAST ELECTION, HE HAD

22:55.800 --> 22:56.133
77 MILLION VOTES.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.466
THE OTHER GUY GOT 81 MILLION

22:58.533 --> 23:00.900
VOTES, 7 MILLION MORE, IT'S A

23:00.966 --> 23:01.100
FACT.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.866
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION,

23:02.933 --> 23:03.933
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN FACTS.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.466
HE LOST THE ELECTION.

23:05.533 --> 23:07.633
HE'S A LOSER!

23:07.700 --> 23:10.033
HE HAD TO STAND BEFORE HIS

23:10.100 --> 23:11.366
VOTERS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON HAD

23:11.433 --> 23:12.666
TO DO, JOHN McCAIN HAD TO DO

23:12.733 --> 23:13.933
IT, MITT ROMNEY HAD TO DO IT,

23:14.000 --> 23:15.666
AL GORE HAD TO DO IT, WHEN YOU

23:15.733 --> 23:18.466
LOSE YOU'VE GOT TO STAND UP AND

23:18.533 --> 23:19.233
TELL THEM YOU LOST.

23:19.300 --> 23:21.400
>> Bill: HE LOST THIS ROUND.

23:21.466 --> 23:22.300
THEY'RE ALL LAUGHING AND SAYING

23:22.366 --> 23:23.666
TRUMP IS NEVER GOING TO SAY HE

23:23.733 --> 23:24.633
LOST AND HE'S NEVER GOING TO GO

23:24.700 --> 23:27.333
AWAY, I'M TELLING YOU IT'S JUST

23:27.400 --> 23:29.866
TAKING MORE THAN ONE CYCLE.

23:29.933 --> 23:30.966
THAT SHARK IS NOT GONE.

23:31.033 --> 23:34.133
IT'S OUT TO SEA.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.333
>> WHAT'S THE REINSTATEMENT

23:35.400 --> 23:35.533
THEN?

23:35.600 --> 23:40.433
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS!

23:40.500 --> 23:41.533
>> Bill: DONALD TRUMP IS A

23:41.600 --> 23:43.500
MALIGNANT NARCISSIST, YOU CAN

23:43.566 --> 23:45.233
BREAK UP WITH A NARCISSIST.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.533
IT'S GLENN CLOSE IN FATAL

23:47.600 --> 23:49.300
ATTRACTION.

23:49.366 --> 23:52.033
>> ISAAC IT'S FREDDY KRUEGER!

23:52.100 --> 23:55.100
>> I WILL NOT BE IGNORED, DAN!

23:55.166 --> 23:56.333
>> Bill: HE'S THE EX-HUSBAND

23:56.400 --> 23:57.800
WHO THINKS THE WIFE IS COMING

23:57.866 --> 24:00.433
BACK TO HIM EVEN THOUGH SHE IS

24:00.500 --> 24:02.066
REMARRIED.

24:02.133 --> 24:02.933
HE'D RATHER SHE'D BE DEAD THAN

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
TO BE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

24:05.066 --> 24:08.700
EXCEPT WE ARE THE WIFE.

24:08.766 --> 24:09.633
AND HE'S NOT GOING AWAY.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.900
>> THE SCARY THING IS, THERE ARE

24:12.966 --> 24:13.800
LARGE PERCENTAGE OF REPUBLICANS

24:13.866 --> 24:16.100
LIKE OVER 75% WHO THINK THE

24:16.166 --> 24:18.866
ELECTION WAS STOLEN.

24:18.933 --> 24:19.900
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS YOU

24:19.966 --> 24:22.266
BEGIN TO BUILD A SUBCULTURE THEY

24:22.333 --> 24:24.233
ARE OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT EVEN

24:24.300 --> 24:25.166
BELIEVE IN THE RESULTS OF OUR

24:25.233 --> 24:27.833
NATIONAL ELECTIONS.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.833
IT HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE

24:29.900 --> 24:31.066
WAY THIS COUNTRY GOES GOING

24:31.133 --> 24:33.233
FORWARD AND WE HAVE TO BREAK THE

24:33.300 --> 24:33.433
SPELL.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.566
>> Bill: BUT HOW?

24:35.633 --> 24:37.133
>> YOU KNOW, BILL, THE ANSWER TO

24:37.200 --> 24:39.266
IT IS VERY SIMPLE.

24:39.333 --> 24:39.900
WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT WE NEED

24:39.966 --> 24:42.233
TO LIVE A LIFE BIGGER THAN

24:42.300 --> 24:44.566
OURSELVES AND WE CAN'T BE STUCK

24:44.633 --> 24:46.266
IN THIS I CULTURE SO IF I'M IN A

24:46.333 --> 24:47.266
TRIBE THAT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT'S

24:47.333 --> 24:48.400
GOOD FOR THE TRIBE, IT'S NOT

24:48.466 --> 24:50.233
GOOD FOR ANYBODY ELSE.

24:50.300 --> 24:52.400
THAT HAS TO BE BROKEN.

24:52.466 --> 24:54.400
AND PEOPLE NEED TO STAND UP AND

24:54.466 --> 24:55.733
SAY THAT, YES, WE CAN GO FORWARD

24:55.800 --> 24:57.666
AND WE ARE GOING TO REJECT THIS

24:57.733 --> 24:58.633
NONSENSE AND THERE'S REPUBLICANS

24:58.700 --> 25:01.400
DOING IT AND I'M ONE OF THEM.

25:01.466 --> 25:05.733
[APPLAUSE]

25:05.800 --> 25:07.433
>> YOU NEED A CODE RINGTONE

25:07.500 --> 25:08.600
FIGURE OUT WHAT TRUMP TALKING

25:08.666 --> 25:08.800
ABOUT.

25:08.866 --> 25:12.100
HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS

25:12.166 --> 25:13.000
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT'S TOO

25:13.066 --> 25:15.333
EXPENSIVE, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

25:15.400 --> 25:16.600
THE WHITE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY

25:16.666 --> 25:18.900
BEING OUTNUMBERED EVENTUALLY.

25:18.966 --> 25:19.866
IT'S CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICALLY

25:19.933 --> 25:20.466
AND NO MATTER WHAT THEY TALK

25:20.533 --> 25:21.966
ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE

25:22.033 --> 25:22.366
THINKING ABOUT.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.333
IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHY THE

25:24.400 --> 25:26.100
PEOPLE ARE SO PRO TRUMP IT'S NOT

25:26.166 --> 25:26.900
BECAUSE HE'S ANY GOOD OR HE

25:26.966 --> 25:29.266
TELLS THE TRUTH, HE NEVER TELLS

25:29.333 --> 25:30.233
THE TRUTH, NEVER DOES ANYTHING,

25:30.300 --> 25:31.933
BUT HE SAYS I HATE WHO YOU

25:32.000 --> 25:32.333
HATES.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.200
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.733
THAT'S WHY TRUMP HAS BEEN

25:35.800 --> 25:37.166
SUCCESSFUL, HE DOESN'T WIN BACK

25:37.233 --> 25:38.933
THE DEMOCRATIC CHASE AND DOESN'T

25:39.000 --> 25:40.133
WANT MAJORITY RULE, HE MADE IT

25:40.200 --> 25:44.733
PRETTY CLEAR HE LOSS THE FIRM FM

25:44.800 --> 25:44.933
ALIEN.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.200
>> Bill: THERE'S A REPUBLICAN

25:46.266 --> 25:49.266
FOR THAT REPUBLICANS, ALL

25:49.333 --> 25:50.533
RESPECT FOR THE GOOD REPUBLICANS

25:50.600 --> 25:52.100
OUT THERE, THERE'S ONE ISSUE YOU

25:52.166 --> 25:53.900
CAN'T BE WRONG ON IF YOU'RE

25:53.966 --> 25:55.233
REPUBLICAN AND YOU WANT TO GET

25:55.300 --> 25:56.766
ELECTED AND THAT'S VOTER

25:56.833 --> 25:57.066
SUPPRESSION.

25:57.133 --> 26:00.700
YOU HAVE TO BE FOR IT.

26:00.766 --> 26:01.100
VERY FOR IT.

26:01.166 --> 26:04.866
THIS GUY IN FLORIDA,

26:04.933 --> 26:07.666
RON DeSANTIS, SOME THINGS, YOU

26:07.733 --> 26:09.266
KNOW, YOU THINK HE IS SAYING BUT

26:09.333 --> 26:13.666
ON THIS ISSUE HE IS A FASCIST.

26:13.733 --> 26:14.666
HE IS RIGHT WITH THE CROWD AND

26:14.733 --> 26:16.066
HE'S NEVER GOING TO GIVE THAT UP

26:16.133 --> 26:17.700
AND THAT'S THE ONE ISSUE YOU

26:17.766 --> 26:20.166
HAVE TO GET YOURSELF RIGHT ON.

26:20.233 --> 26:23.700
STOPPING PEOPLE FROM VOTING AND

26:23.766 --> 26:24.366
THEN IF DEMOCRATS DON'T GET SOME

26:24.433 --> 26:27.100
SORT OF NATIONAL STANDARDS

26:27.166 --> 26:28.866
BEFORE 2022, I THINK THE GAME IS

26:28.933 --> 26:29.066
OVER.

26:29.133 --> 26:31.300
BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS ARE

26:31.366 --> 26:32.500
GOING TO DO WELL IN THE

26:32.566 --> 26:32.766
ELECTION.

26:32.833 --> 26:35.533
>> I'VE HELD OUT FOR A VERY LONG

26:35.600 --> 26:37.066
TIME AS GOVERNOR, EXPANDED

26:37.133 --> 26:37.666
MEDICAID WHEN I WAS THE ONLY

26:37.733 --> 26:38.533
REAL REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY

26:38.600 --> 26:40.433
TO DO IT.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.866
LET ME EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU IF

26:41.933 --> 26:42.566
YOU'RE AN POLITICS AND YOU CAN

26:42.633 --> 26:45.500
DO DO WHAT YOU BELIEVE THEN GET

26:45.566 --> 26:46.933
OUT.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.033
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.233
IN OTHER WORDS LET'S TAKE THE

26:50.300 --> 26:51.533
ISSUE OF VOTER SUPPRESSION, WE

26:51.600 --> 26:52.700
SPENT ALL THIS TIME MAKING IT

26:52.766 --> 26:53.800
EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE AND

26:53.866 --> 26:55.233
NOW THEY WANT TO MAKE IT MORE

26:55.300 --> 26:56.466
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.533
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS AND IT'S WRONG.

26:58.600 --> 27:02.000
IN MY STATE OF OHIO, IT HASN'T

27:02.066 --> 27:02.300
BEEN THERE.

27:02.366 --> 27:04.333
>> Bill: JOHN, GREAT SPEECH TO

27:04.400 --> 27:05.600
MAKE HERE.

27:05.666 --> 27:06.600
TRY TO MAKE THE SPEECH AND GET

27:06.666 --> 27:06.966
ELECTED IN OHIO.

27:07.033 --> 27:09.866
>> GUESS WHAT, I MIGHT.

27:09.933 --> 27:11.033
>> Bill: GET YOUR ASS KICKED.

27:11.100 --> 27:14.033
>> I MIGHT NOT WIN THIS TIME.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.700
>> Bill: TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

27:15.766 --> 27:18.233
>> CHURCHILL SAID IN POLITICS

27:18.300 --> 27:20.633
THE MORE DON'T MARK WHERE YOU

27:20.700 --> 27:22.700
CAN DIE ONCE, POLITICS YOU CAN

27:22.766 --> 27:23.600
DIE MANY TIMES.

27:23.666 --> 27:25.000
>> Bill: OKAY, I'M JUST

27:25.066 --> 27:26.533
TELLING YOU.

27:26.600 --> 27:32.433
I AGREE WITH THAT, SO WHAT.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.900
HE WAS A SENATOR, HE RETIRED AND

27:33.966 --> 27:37.433
SO HIS SEAT IS OPEN.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.833
ALL THE REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR

27:38.900 --> 27:39.633
ROB PORTMAN SEES, YOU KNOW WHERE

27:39.700 --> 27:42.866
THEY ALL MADE THEIR FIRST?

27:42.933 --> 27:43.166
MAR-A-LAGO.

27:43.233 --> 27:47.600
THEY WENT DOWN THERE TO KISS THE

27:47.666 --> 27:48.266
RING BEFORE -- THAT'S WHERE THE

27:48.333 --> 27:50.700
PARTY IS.

27:50.766 --> 27:52.133
SO, THIS IS A LOVELY SPEECH THAT

27:52.200 --> 27:54.433
WOULD NOT WORK.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.300
>> I'D LIKE A QUESTION TO THE

27:56.366 --> 27:58.166
REPUBLICANS DO BELIEVE EVERYBODY

27:58.233 --> 27:58.466
SHOULD VOTE?

27:58.533 --> 27:58.900
>> Bill: EVERYBODY?

27:58.966 --> 28:01.100
>> NO.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.333
>> THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN IT.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.466
>> Bill: EVERYBODY COULD VOTE,

28:04.533 --> 28:04.833
YOU SAID SHOULD.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.200
IF YOU KNOW NOTHING YOU

28:06.266 --> 28:06.466
SHOULDN'T.

28:06.533 --> 28:11.466
>> LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING.

28:11.533 --> 28:13.000
>> Bill: YOUR LEARNING HISTORY

28:13.066 --> 28:14.166
FROM INSTAGRAM, PLEASE, JUST

28:14.233 --> 28:16.633
STAY OUT OF IT.

28:16.700 --> 28:17.733
>> THE 15TH AMENDMENT IN THE

28:17.800 --> 28:19.800
CONSTITUTION WHICH ALLOWED THE

28:19.866 --> 28:21.200
FORMER SLAVES TO VOTE.

28:21.266 --> 28:24.300
IT BASICALLY SAID THE CONGRESS

28:24.366 --> 28:27.400
SHALL PASS LEGISLATION TO MAKE

28:27.466 --> 28:27.766
THIS WORK TO GET

28:27.833 --> 28:30.466
AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO VOTE.

28:30.533 --> 28:31.333
THE CONGRESS HAS A

28:31.400 --> 28:32.366
RESPONSIBILITY TO GO IN AND MAKE

28:32.433 --> 28:35.066
SURE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE.

28:35.133 --> 28:36.600
SOULS TO THE POLLS EARLY VOTING

28:36.666 --> 28:38.633
MINORITY COMMUNITY, IT'S ALL

28:38.700 --> 28:40.700
ESTABLISHED AND VOTING ON ITS

28:40.766 --> 28:42.800
OWN WAY AFTER GOING TO CHURCH ON

28:42.866 --> 28:43.033
SUNDAY.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.200
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN THE STATE

28:44.266 --> 28:46.966
IS MAKING SURE IT IS

28:47.033 --> 28:48.066
PARTICULARLY THAT BLACK PEOPLE

28:48.133 --> 28:48.933
DON'T VOTE.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.166
>> Bill: AGAIN, THE QUESTION

28:50.233 --> 28:50.533
KEEPS COMING UP.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.533
IT WOULD WE DO ABOUT IT?

28:52.600 --> 28:55.200
SOME PEOPLE SAY WE SHOULD GET

28:55.266 --> 28:56.500
RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND I'M

28:56.566 --> 28:57.266
ONE OF THE PEOPLE.

28:57.333 --> 28:58.700
I NOTICE THERE'S A COUPLE

28:58.766 --> 29:00.866
DEMOCRATS WHO WON'T GO ALONG SO

29:00.933 --> 29:03.266
IT'S DEAD BUT THE FILIBUSTER

29:03.333 --> 29:04.900
ITSELF IS REALLY A CHANGE IN THE

29:04.966 --> 29:06.633
CONSTITUTION BECAUSE WHAT IT IS

29:06.700 --> 29:09.033
SAYING IS THE FOUNDERS WANTED TO

29:09.100 --> 29:10.866
SAY 50, IF YOU HAVE JUST ONE

29:10.933 --> 29:12.166
MORE VOTE AND THAT'S THE

29:12.233 --> 29:14.266
VICE PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE ARE AT

29:14.333 --> 29:16.133
50/50, IF YOU HAVE JUST ONE MORE

29:16.200 --> 29:16.966
VOTE YOU DON'T NEED A SUPER

29:17.033 --> 29:18.100
MAJORITY.

29:18.166 --> 29:19.633
IF YOU JUST NEED 50 TO PASS

29:19.700 --> 29:20.266
LEGISLATION AND THAT'S THE WAY

29:20.333 --> 29:22.566
WE ALWAYS DID IT.

29:22.633 --> 29:24.633
THEN IT BECAME THE FILIBUSTER,

29:24.700 --> 29:26.133
WHICH WAS USED RARELY BACK IN

29:26.200 --> 29:27.833
THE DAY BUT NOW IT'S FOR

29:27.900 --> 29:30.400
EVERYTHING WHICH MEANS YOU NEED

29:30.466 --> 29:31.033
60.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.066
IT'S SKEWED FIRST OF ALL THE

29:33.133 --> 29:35.000
FOUNDERS OF THE CONSTITUTION

29:35.066 --> 29:38.933
WANTED AND IT'S NOT A CHRISTIAN

29:39.000 --> 29:39.900
CINEMA SAID IT ENCOURAGES

29:39.966 --> 29:40.433
BIPARTISANSHIP, ONE OF THE

29:40.500 --> 29:41.766
DEMOCRATS THAT WON'T GO ALONG.

29:41.833 --> 29:43.766
IT ENCOURAGES OBSTRUCTIONISM.

29:43.833 --> 29:45.700
IT DOESN'T HELP AND IT'S GOT TO

29:45.766 --> 29:46.266
GO.

29:46.333 --> 29:47.633
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE ISSUE IS

29:47.700 --> 29:50.366
ELECTIONS THEMSELVES.

29:50.433 --> 29:52.233
THEY ARE FUCKING, IT'S ONE THING

29:52.300 --> 29:53.866
ISSUES WITH IN ELECTIONS AND THE

29:53.933 --> 29:56.066
OTHER THING WHEN THE ISSUE IS

29:56.133 --> 29:56.833
ELECTIONS.

29:56.900 --> 29:57.700
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT HAVE A NUCLEAR

29:57.766 --> 30:00.666
OPTION HERE.

30:00.733 --> 30:03.233
>> I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL, THE

30:03.300 --> 30:04.466
FILIBUSTER -- YOU GO AHEAD AND

30:04.533 --> 30:05.666
GET RID OF IT AND WE'VE GOT RID

30:05.733 --> 30:08.500
OF IT PARTIALLY NOW AND WE'VE

30:08.566 --> 30:09.466
HAD THINGS HAPPEN.

30:09.533 --> 30:11.333
WE HAVE A BLIGHT, GET RID OF THE

30:11.400 --> 30:12.066
FILIBUSTER AND THE OTHER SIDE

30:12.133 --> 30:12.633
GETS AND THEN THEY JAM AND

30:12.700 --> 30:15.300
RIVERS EVERY THING ELSE.

30:15.366 --> 30:16.300
BUT I WANTED TO GO BACK.

30:16.366 --> 30:17.766
>> Bill: YOU DON'T GET RID OF

30:17.833 --> 30:19.300
AT THE OTHER SIDE'S NEVER GOING

30:19.366 --> 30:19.733
TO GET IT.

30:19.800 --> 30:20.800
I MEAN US.

30:20.866 --> 30:22.866
>> LET ME MAKE TWO POINTS.

30:22.933 --> 30:23.666
THE CHANGE IN THE COUNTRY COMES

30:23.733 --> 30:25.266
FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND I TOLD

30:25.333 --> 30:27.666
YOU THAT, CIVIL RIGHTS, WOMAN

30:27.733 --> 30:28.500
SUFFRAGE, IT COMES FROM US

30:28.566 --> 30:30.800
PUSHING UP AND FORCING THOSE AT

30:30.866 --> 30:31.833
THE TOP TO CHANGE.

30:31.900 --> 30:33.800
AND SECONDLY, I REJECT THE

30:33.866 --> 30:35.466
NOTION THAT YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT

30:35.533 --> 30:36.500
ANY OF THIS NONSENSE IN THE

30:36.566 --> 30:37.966
REPUBLICAN PARTY TO GET ELECTED.

30:38.033 --> 30:41.000
I'VE RUN FOR OFFICE WHEN NO ONE

30:41.066 --> 30:46.333
THOUGHT I COULD WIN IN THE FACT

30:46.400 --> 30:47.400
WHEN YOU BELIEVE IN THINGS

30:47.466 --> 30:48.633
DEEPLY IT'S AMAZING HOW YOU CAN

30:48.700 --> 30:49.833
TURN OTHER PEOPLE ONTO YOUR

30:49.900 --> 30:52.800
CANDIDACY AND YOU CAN WIN.

30:52.866 --> 30:55.300
THIS IS NOT SOME BLUE SKY

30:55.366 --> 30:55.566
HYPERBOLE.

30:55.633 --> 30:56.500
>> Bill: ARE YOU GOING TO RUN

30:56.566 --> 30:56.700
AGAIN?

30:56.766 --> 30:57.833
>> NO, I KIND OF LIKE WHAT I'M

30:57.900 --> 30:59.100
DOING NOW.

30:59.166 --> 31:01.500
IT'S GREAT IN THEORY.

31:01.566 --> 31:02.633
>> Bill: WHEN YOU'RE NOT TOO

31:02.700 --> 31:03.266
OLD TO DO IT.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.266
BELIEVE IN IT SO MUCH.

31:05.333 --> 31:05.833
BE THAT GUY.

31:05.900 --> 31:09.000
YOU WILL GET YOUR ASS KICKED.

31:09.066 --> 31:12.933
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, YOU WILL.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.066
I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE OF

31:16.133 --> 31:16.266
HELP.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.900
CAMPAIGN WITH ME.

31:18.966 --> 31:20.333
THE DISTRICT IN OHIO.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.900
YOU'LL DO A FUCKING GREAT JOB.

31:22.966 --> 31:25.200
>> I THINK THEY HAVE A STRATEGY.

31:25.266 --> 31:27.000
MITCH McCONNELL, YOU KNOW, YOU

31:27.066 --> 31:28.733
COULD SAY ELMER FUDD BUT HE'S

31:28.800 --> 31:29.733
PROBABLY BUGS BUNNY, HE GETS

31:29.800 --> 31:31.966
AWAY WITH EVERYTHING.

31:32.033 --> 31:33.833
I THINK YOU GOT THE STRATEGY,

31:33.900 --> 31:34.833
MAKE SURE THE DEMOCRATS AND

31:34.900 --> 31:36.000
BIDEN GET NOTHING THROUGH FOR

31:36.066 --> 31:36.666
THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF AND

31:36.733 --> 31:37.933
THEY GO TO THE POLLS NEXT YEAR

31:38.000 --> 31:40.833
ON THREE ISSUES, THREE NEGATIVE

31:40.900 --> 31:41.400
ISSUES.

31:41.466 --> 31:42.066
THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT CRIME,

31:42.133 --> 31:43.300
THEY'RE GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

31:43.366 --> 31:45.300
THE BORDER, THEY WILL COMPLAIN

31:45.366 --> 31:45.666
ABOUT PRICES.

31:45.733 --> 31:47.500
IF THEY WANT TO RUN AN ENTIRELY

31:47.566 --> 31:48.266
NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN NEXT YEAR AND

31:48.333 --> 31:50.233
THE WAY THEY WANT TO GET AWAY

31:50.300 --> 31:51.100
WITH IT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

31:51.166 --> 31:52.100
NO SUCCESSES.

31:52.166 --> 31:55.700
MAKE SURE THERE IS NO SUCCESSES.

31:55.766 --> 31:57.866
>> THERE IS PLENTY OF SUCCESSES.

31:57.933 --> 32:00.166
>> VOTING RIGHTS, POLICE REFORM,

32:00.233 --> 32:02.000
AS YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH THE

32:02.066 --> 32:02.833
CONGRESSMAN, GOT TO DO SOMETHING

32:02.900 --> 32:04.866
ON GUNS AND IMMIGRATION.

32:04.933 --> 32:06.233
A LOT OF THE THINGS DEMOCRATS

32:06.300 --> 32:07.366
WANT TO GET DONE THEY WANT TO

32:07.433 --> 32:08.500
PASS LAWS TO IMPROVE THE COUNTRY

32:08.566 --> 32:10.133
AND THEY WANT TO DO THINGS!

32:10.200 --> 32:11.200
MITCH McCONNELL WANTS TO MAKE

32:11.266 --> 32:13.066
SURE NOBODY DOES ANYTHING EXCEPT

32:13.133 --> 32:14.233
BLAME SOMEBODY.

32:14.300 --> 32:14.933
>> Bill: AS ALWAYS, THE

32:15.000 --> 32:17.466
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION ENDS

32:17.533 --> 32:19.200
WITH THE ECONOMY GOING OFF THE

32:19.266 --> 32:19.933
CLIFF.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.700
IF IT HAPPENED WITH BUSH, OBAMA

32:21.766 --> 32:23.733
CAME IN AND STRAIGHTENED IT OUT,

32:23.800 --> 32:24.533
BIDEN CAME IN AND STRAIGHTEN IT

32:24.600 --> 32:26.500
OUT, THE ECONOMY IS DOING GOOD.

32:26.566 --> 32:29.033
PEOPLE ARE NOT -- PEOPLE ARE

32:29.100 --> 32:29.333
VACCINATED.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.400
THEY HAVE PLENTY TO RUN ON.

32:32.466 --> 32:33.433
APROPOS OF THE DISCUSSION, THREE

32:33.500 --> 32:34.866
QUARTERS OF REPUBLICANS THINK

32:34.933 --> 32:39.200
THAT THE RIOTS, THE CAPITOL HILL

32:39.266 --> 32:39.800
RIOT WAS NOT TRUMP SUPPORTERS

32:39.866 --> 32:42.800
OUT THERE.

32:42.866 --> 32:45.900
THEY THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY

32:45.966 --> 32:46.500
LIBERALS AND DEMOCRATS DRESSED

32:46.566 --> 32:51.333
UP AS THEM MAKING THEM -- I'M

32:51.400 --> 32:53.266

32:53.766 --> 32:55.666
TRYING TO MAKE TRUMP LOOK BAD.

32:55.733 --> 32:58.500

33:22.866 --> 33:24.933
THERE IS EVEN A CATALOG NOW,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.466
FALSE FLAG SUPPLY.

YOU WANT YOUR COPY OF THE

35:17.733 --> 35:18.300
CONSTITUTION, THEY CARRY A COPY

35:18.366 --> 35:19.766
AND MAKE SURE IT'S STILL IN THE

35:19.833 --> 35:20.366
PACKAGING BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER

35:20.433 --> 35:21.600
READ IT.

35:21.666 --> 35:26.566
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

35:26.633 --> 35:29.133
FINALLY, NOT TO LEAVE THE LADIES

35:29.200 --> 35:31.133
OUT OF THIS, YOU WANT THESE ARE

35:31.200 --> 35:33.800
TERRIFIC, MIKE PENCE EARRINGS.

35:33.866 --> 35:41.833
SEE, HE IS HANGING, C.

35:41.900 --> 35:48.433
RELEASING THIS.

35:48.500 --> 35:52.266
COMEDY BREAK, FELLOWS.

35:52.333 --> 35:53.966
ALL RIGHT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

35:54.033 --> 35:55.966
SOME OTHER ISSUES HERE.

35:56.033 --> 35:57.200
ONE IS THE HACKING THAT'S GOING

35:57.266 --> 35:58.100
ON.

35:58.166 --> 35:58.866
YOU'RE TOO SMART, GUYS, THINK

35:58.933 --> 36:02.100
ABOUT THIS, WE FIRST HAD THE

36:02.166 --> 36:05.800
COLONIAL PIPELINE HACKED AND

36:05.866 --> 36:08.833
THEN THE MITA DIDN'T GET THROUG

36:08.900 --> 36:09.366
THROUGH.

36:09.433 --> 36:10.700
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, THE FBI

36:10.766 --> 36:11.900
DIRECTOR SO THERE'S A LOT OF

36:11.966 --> 36:13.300
PARALLELS TO 9/11, TALKING ABOUT

36:13.366 --> 36:14.066
HACKING IN GENERAL.

36:14.133 --> 36:16.033
HE SAID THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS

36:16.100 --> 36:22.633
NOT RELEAS REALIZING IT CAN AFF.

36:22.700 --> 36:23.900
AT THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM IS

36:23.966 --> 36:25.266
ONE THAT I THINK THE COUNTRY HAS

36:25.333 --> 36:27.633
DID COME TO TERMS WITH AND HE'S

36:27.700 --> 36:27.833
RIGHT.

36:27.900 --> 36:28.500
WE ARE NOT JUST FIGHTING THE

36:28.566 --> 36:31.800
LAST WAR BY BUYING AIRCRAFT

36:31.866 --> 36:33.766
CARRIERS, WE ARE IGNORING THE

36:33.833 --> 36:34.633
CURRENT ONE.

36:34.700 --> 36:35.233
THIS IS ALREADY THE WAR AND I

36:35.300 --> 36:37.300
GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF THIS IS

36:37.366 --> 36:41.666
HOW WARFARE IS NOW, ARE WE STILL

36:41.733 --> 36:42.333
A SUPERPOWER?

36:42.400 --> 36:45.433
>> THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THIS

36:45.500 --> 36:46.933
WHOLE ISSUE OF CYBERSECURITY IT

36:47.000 --> 36:48.566
SPREAD OUT AND ABOUT SIX OR

36:48.633 --> 36:50.266
SEVEN PLACES INSIDE THE FEDERAL

36:50.333 --> 36:51.166
GOVERNMENT.

36:51.233 --> 36:52.466
YOU HAVE ALL THIS BUREAUCRACY,

36:52.533 --> 36:53.800
ALL OF THEM HAVING A PIECE,

36:53.866 --> 36:56.300
NOBODY'S IN CHARGE.

36:56.366 --> 36:58.166
OUR OPPONENTS KNOW THAT, NUMBER

36:58.233 --> 36:59.033
ONE.

36:59.100 --> 37:01.200
NUMBER TWO, THAT NEEDS TO BE

37:01.266 --> 37:01.533
CONSOLIDATED.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.600
I DID FOR EXAMPLE IN MY

37:03.666 --> 37:04.800
STATEMENT I CONSOLIDATED

37:04.866 --> 37:05.233
PROGRAMS THAT NEEDED

37:05.300 --> 37:06.866
CONSOLIDATING LIKE HEALTH CARE

37:06.933 --> 37:07.466
PROGRAMS WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO

37:07.533 --> 37:10.366
CUT THE COSTS AND SERVE MORE

37:10.433 --> 37:11.133
PEOPLE.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.233
THIS, YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP THE

37:12.300 --> 37:13.866
TURF AND THIS IS AGAIN BACK TO

37:13.933 --> 37:16.100
IA, I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP THE

37:16.166 --> 37:16.500
TURF.

37:16.566 --> 37:17.866
YOU'VE GOT THINGS OF THE

37:17.933 --> 37:20.066
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, HOMELAND

37:20.133 --> 37:21.366
SECURITY, NSA, ALL THIS

37:21.433 --> 37:23.000
BUREAUCRACY AND IT NEVER WORKS.

37:23.066 --> 37:24.866
SECONDLY, WE HAVE TO HAVE AN

37:24.933 --> 37:25.333
OFFENSE OF POLICY.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.633
WE HAVE TO HAVE FOR US, WE HAVE

37:26.700 --> 37:28.033
TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT

37:28.100 --> 37:29.533
GOING TO PUT UP WITH THAT MUCH

37:29.600 --> 37:29.766
LONGER.

37:29.833 --> 37:31.600
IT HAS TO COME OUT OF THE

37:31.666 --> 37:31.833
PRESENT.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.833
>> Bill: WHEN YOU ABOUT GIVING

37:33.900 --> 37:35.700
UP STUFF THAT WE HAVE BEEN

37:35.766 --> 37:37.200
SELFISH ABOUT, THIS GOES BACK TO

37:37.266 --> 37:40.633
EISENHOWER IN 1960 WITH HIS

37:40.700 --> 37:42.233
MILITARY INDUSTRIAL CONFLICT.

37:42.300 --> 37:46.133
>> TOO MUCH STUFF!

37:46.200 --> 37:47.566
GET IT SHRINK DOWN AND HAVE A

37:47.633 --> 37:47.800
POLICY.

37:47.866 --> 37:50.133
>> Bill: WE SPENT

37:50.200 --> 37:52.233
$18.7 BILLION FOR CYBERSECURITY.

37:52.300 --> 37:53.666
THAT IS NOTHING.

37:53.733 --> 37:57.033
AT THE PENTAGON SPENT

37:57.100 --> 37:57.366
$750 BILLION.

37:57.433 --> 37:58.366
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO GET

37:58.433 --> 38:02.366
CYBER LOOTED BEFORE WE STOP

38:02.433 --> 38:03.033
BUILDING BATTLESHIPS AND

38:03.100 --> 38:03.800
SUMMARIES TO FIGHT THE

38:03.866 --> 38:05.666
SOVIET UNION IN 1979?

38:05.733 --> 38:07.500
IT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE FOR

38:07.566 --> 38:10.533
THE DEFENSE, THEY ARE FOR

38:10.600 --> 38:11.766
CONTRACTORS.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.466
>> OF THE DEFENSE REFORMER AND I

38:13.533 --> 38:14.933
WAS ABLE TO HALT THE PRODUCTION

38:15.000 --> 38:15.666
OF THE B-2 BOMBER BECAUSE I

38:15.733 --> 38:18.866
THOUGHT IT WAS EXCESSIVE AND YOU

38:18.933 --> 38:20.133
ARE RIGHT AND WHEN YOU SAY AT

38:20.200 --> 38:21.000
TIMES OF THE PUBLIC WORKS

38:21.066 --> 38:23.000
PROGRAM IN THE PENTAGON.

38:23.066 --> 38:24.800
GET RID OF THE STUFF YOU DON'T

38:24.866 --> 38:26.266
NEED AND FOCUS ON THE THREAT OF

38:26.333 --> 38:28.333
TODAY AND THE THREAT OF

38:28.400 --> 38:28.600
TOMORROW.

38:28.666 --> 38:30.966
A BIG ONE IS CYBER.

38:31.033 --> 38:34.866
A BIG ONE.

38:34.933 --> 38:35.633
MOBILITY, SPEED, POWER.

38:35.700 --> 38:37.566
>> Bill: WE COULD HAVE SO MUCH

38:37.633 --> 38:38.200
MORE MONEY FOR OTHER THINGS IF

38:38.266 --> 38:41.900
WE DON'T BUILD TANKS WE ARE

38:41.966 --> 38:43.366
NEVER GOING TO USE.

38:43.433 --> 38:45.433
>> PEARL HARBOR WAS HER SHOCK,

38:45.500 --> 38:47.166
THE SHIPS LINED UP IN PERFECT

38:47.233 --> 38:48.600
TARGET PRACTICE FOR THE JAPANESE

38:48.666 --> 38:49.166
EMPIRE.

38:49.233 --> 38:50.333
WE HAD 9/11, THE GUYS WERE ABLE

38:50.400 --> 38:52.666
TO GET ON PLANES AND USE --

38:52.733 --> 38:53.666
THEY'VE GOT THE TRAINING IN

38:53.733 --> 38:55.066
FLORIDA HOW DID FLY THE PLANES

38:55.133 --> 38:57.200
AND WE WERE TOTALLY VULNERABLE.

38:57.266 --> 38:58.133
THIS TIME AROUND WE ARE TOTALLY

38:58.200 --> 38:59.000
VULNERABLE AND 70 SAID THE OTHER

38:59.066 --> 39:01.466
DAY WE NEED A MANHATTAN PROJECT.

39:01.533 --> 39:02.133
WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT IT,

39:02.200 --> 39:04.466
LIKE THE BOMB IN WORLD WAR II.

39:04.533 --> 39:05.800
WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT

39:05.866 --> 39:06.400
WE'VE COME THROUGH BEFORE AND

39:06.466 --> 39:08.366
LOOK HOW FAST WE GOT THE

39:08.433 --> 39:09.466
VACCINATIONS.

39:09.533 --> 39:10.666
IT STILL WORKS AND IT'S THE

39:10.733 --> 39:12.266
PRIVATE SECTOR BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

39:12.333 --> 39:14.566
ONE COMPANY, A MEAT COMPANY GETS

39:14.633 --> 39:16.733
HIT, PIPELINE COMPANY GETS HITS,

39:16.800 --> 39:18.233
NOT SHARING THE INFORMATION AND

39:18.300 --> 39:19.200
NO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FOR THE

39:19.266 --> 39:20.533
THINGS COMING IN AT US AND

39:20.600 --> 39:21.166
THERE'S NO UNITED -- WHAT'S

39:21.233 --> 39:22.766
GOING ON.

39:22.833 --> 39:25.000
IT'S A PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE

39:25.066 --> 39:25.600
PUBLIC SECTOR BUT IT TAKES A

39:25.666 --> 39:29.333
LEADER TO DO THIS, MAY BE A ONE

39:29.400 --> 39:29.733
PERSON TO DO IT.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.033
>> THIS CAN BE FIXED.

39:32.100 --> 39:35.200
IF SPEAK OF HAVE VERY FEW

39:35.266 --> 39:35.766
TARGETS, NOT MUCH WE CAN HIT

39:35.833 --> 39:38.866
THEM WITH.

39:38.933 --> 39:40.700
WHERE LIKE A LITERAL GLASS HOUSE

39:40.766 --> 39:41.266
OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY.

39:41.333 --> 39:43.666
>> THEY DON'T HAVE ELECTRICITY

39:43.733 --> 39:43.933
IN RUSSIA?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.133
>> YOU GET INTO A BACK-AND-FORTH

39:46.200 --> 39:46.733
FIGHT WITH THEM IN MAY NOT BE

39:46.800 --> 39:50.633
THE RIGHT -- GO AGAINST THEM

39:50.700 --> 39:51.400
COVERTLY.

39:51.466 --> 39:52.233
ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES

39:52.300 --> 39:53.600
GOVERNMENT CAN ATTACK THEM.

39:53.666 --> 39:55.800
AT THE BUSINESSES CAN'T ATTACK

39:55.866 --> 39:56.800
BACK, COLONIAL CAN'T ATTACK

39:56.866 --> 39:59.800
BACK, TAKES U.S. GOVERNMENT.

39:59.866 --> 40:00.766
>> SEE, THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU

40:00.833 --> 40:01.766
HAVE A COMMITTEE DOWN THERE

40:01.833 --> 40:02.666
TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO YOU

40:02.733 --> 40:04.866
NEVER GET AN ANSWER.

40:04.933 --> 40:06.600
SOMEBODY HAS TO BE PUT IN

40:06.666 --> 40:07.266
CHARGE.

40:07.333 --> 40:08.566
THERE HAS TO BE ONE PLACE AND

40:08.633 --> 40:10.866
YOU TAKE AND YOU CENTRALIZE IT

40:10.933 --> 40:11.700
SOMEWHERE AND THEN YOU HAVE AN

40:11.766 --> 40:14.066
OFFENSE OF POLICY.

40:14.133 --> 40:16.500
>> SORT OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

40:16.566 --> 40:18.666
AGENCY.

40:18.733 --> 40:20.500
>> YEAH.

40:20.566 --> 40:20.733
EXACTLY.

40:20.800 --> 40:20.933
EXACTLY.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.433
[LAUGHTER]

40:22.500 --> 40:22.900
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

40:22.966 --> 40:24.066
VIGGO INTEL IS GOOD, BILL,

40:24.133 --> 40:24.666
KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

40:24.733 --> 40:27.366
WORLD IS GOOD, BILL.

40:27.433 --> 40:29.000
>> Bill: I AGREE, I'VE AGREE

40:29.066 --> 40:29.833
COME I'VE NEVER BEEN AGAINST IT.

40:29.900 --> 40:33.166
WE NEED THEM.

40:33.233 --> 40:34.966
BUT ISRAEL DID A HACK THEY THINK

40:35.033 --> 40:38.966
THIS WEEK OF IRAN AND THEY GOT

40:39.033 --> 40:41.166
AN OIL REFINERY TO BLOW UP WHICH

40:41.233 --> 40:43.466
I KNEW YOU COULD DO THINGS LIKE

40:43.533 --> 40:44.833
STOP THE MEAT FROM COMING

40:44.900 --> 40:46.566
THROUGH OR TURN OFF -- I DIDN'T

40:46.633 --> 40:48.966
KNOW YOU COULD BLOW SOMETHING U

40:49.033 --> 40:49.200
UP.

40:49.266 --> 40:50.033
>> LOOK WHAT THEY DID TO THE

40:50.100 --> 40:53.233
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.400
LOOK BACK FIVE YEARS.

40:54.466 --> 40:55.300
IF SPEWING APPARENTLY YOU CAN

40:55.366 --> 40:57.600
OVERHEAT A NUCLEAR PLANT AND

40:57.666 --> 41:02.166
MAKE IT -- SO, LIKE PACK THE

41:02.233 --> 41:03.066
UTILITIES, POWER IN NEW YORK AND

41:03.133 --> 41:04.866
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO BE

41:04.933 --> 41:06.966
HONEST.

41:07.033 --> 41:08.100
>> OF THE COUNTRY HAD DONE THIS

41:08.166 --> 41:12.066
TO US AND SENT A BOMBER DO IT,

41:12.133 --> 41:13.066
WE WOULD OBLITERATE THEM.

41:13.133 --> 41:14.066
BUT WHEN IT IS THROUGH A

41:14.133 --> 41:16.800
COMPUTER, APPARENTLY IT IS

41:16.866 --> 41:17.266
DIFFERENT.

41:17.333 --> 41:19.866
IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFERENT AND

41:19.933 --> 41:20.333
WHAT'S THE DETERRENT?

41:20.400 --> 41:22.166
I GET IN THAT WORLD WARFARE WHAT

41:22.233 --> 41:23.166
THE DETERRENT WAS, NUCLEAR

41:23.233 --> 41:24.033
WEAPONS ARE HORRIBLE BUT THEY

41:24.100 --> 41:25.566
SORT OF KEPT THE PEACE BETWEEN

41:25.633 --> 41:26.333
THE BIG BOYS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

41:26.400 --> 41:28.266
WANT TO USE THEM ON EACH OTHER.

41:28.333 --> 41:31.533
WHAT'S THE DETERRENT HERE?

41:31.600 --> 41:33.133
HOW ARE WE DETERRING THE NEXT

41:33.200 --> 41:33.300
ONE?

41:33.366 --> 41:37.800
SO FAR, OUR POLICY AGAIN,

41:37.866 --> 41:38.400
PRIVATE COMPANIES, PAYING IN

41:38.466 --> 41:41.066
BITCOIN, THE GOVERNMENT BILL.

41:41.133 --> 41:42.733
>> THEY HAVE A STRONG AND

41:42.800 --> 41:43.633
CONSISTENT POLICY ON THIS.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.200
YOU KNOW WHAT, THE WAY YOU'RE

41:45.266 --> 41:46.666
TALKING HERE, MAY BE BIDEN NOT

41:46.733 --> 41:47.800
TO THINK ABOUT PUTTING YOU IN

41:47.866 --> 41:48.733
THAT AND YOU CAN LEAVE THE SHOW

41:48.800 --> 41:53.466
AND I'LL TAKE IT OVER A P.RIOD

41:53.533 --> 41:56.266
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS --

41:56.333 --> 41:57.733
>> Bill: SEVERAL REASONS WHY

41:57.800 --> 41:59.200
THE PLAN WOULDN'T WORK.

41:59.266 --> 42:00.566
>> REPUBLICANS WEREN'T ACTUALLY

42:00.633 --> 42:03.233
UPSET ABOUT THE RUSSIANS

42:03.300 --> 42:04.400
ATTACKING THE DEMOCRATS.

42:04.466 --> 42:05.500
WHY DIDN'T THEY JUMP IN AND SAY,

42:05.566 --> 42:07.333
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU'RE DOING IT

42:07.400 --> 42:12.200
JOE, YOU'RE DOING IT TO THE

42:12.266 --> 42:12.466
AMERICANS.

42:12.533 --> 42:13.933
>> Bill: THIS IS A NATIONAL

42:14.000 --> 42:15.400
SECURITY ISSUE AND IT SHOULD

42:15.466 --> 42:17.066
HAVE NO PARTISAN INVOLVEMENT AT

42:17.133 --> 42:17.700
ALL.

42:17.766 --> 42:18.333
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE HIS REFORM

42:18.400 --> 42:20.033
IN WASHINGTON.

42:20.100 --> 42:21.166
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS WE ARE

42:21.233 --> 42:24.533
GOING TO CONSOLIDATE ALL THESE

42:24.600 --> 42:25.166
BUREAUCRACIES WILL SAY OH, YEAH,

42:25.233 --> 42:28.000
HOW LONG WILL HE BE AROUND?

42:28.066 --> 42:29.066
HE'S GOT TO CONSOLIDATE THEM AND

42:29.133 --> 42:31.433
HAVE A POLICY JUST LIKE YOU SAID

42:31.500 --> 42:34.333
A STRONG POLICY THAT ACTUALLY

42:34.400 --> 42:34.933
CAN IMPOSE DAMAGE AND HURT ON

42:35.000 --> 42:37.666
THOSE WHO HAVE HACKED US BEFORE

42:37.733 --> 42:39.333
IT AFFECTS ALL OF US HERE AND

42:39.400 --> 42:41.766
BEGINS TO UNDERMINE --

42:41.833 --> 42:42.833
>> THE BIGGER THREAT RHINOS THAT

42:42.900 --> 42:43.666
HACKING THAT HOW I CAN WEAR THE

42:43.733 --> 42:46.266
FACT GENERAL COIN WITH A

42:46.333 --> 42:49.433
MILITARY COUP AGAINST THE

42:49.500 --> 42:49.766
GOVERNMENT?

42:49.833 --> 42:52.000
>> TALKING ABOUT GENERAL FLYNN?

42:52.066 --> 42:52.766
>> GENERAL FLYNN ON THE SHOW

42:52.833 --> 42:54.966
ONCE I DON'T KNOW WHY HE DID IT.

42:55.033 --> 42:59.600
WE HAVE THE FOOTAGE.

42:59.666 --> 43:00.133
[LAUGHTER]

43:00.200 --> 43:01.566
'S VIGGO, BILL --

43:01.633 --> 43:03.466
>> Bill: THE ONE THING THAT

43:03.533 --> 43:05.766
MADE YOU LAUGH.

43:05.833 --> 43:09.566
>> I WAS GOOD.

43:09.633 --> 43:12.400
>> Bill: YES, GENERAL FLYNN --

43:12.466 --> 43:14.800
>> BY THE WAY GENERAL FLYNN --

43:14.866 --> 43:16.333
>> Bill: GENERAL FLYNN THE

43:16.400 --> 43:17.366
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR UNDER

43:17.433 --> 43:18.033
TRUMP BEFORE HE LOST HIS JOB OR

43:18.100 --> 43:21.200
LYING TO THE FBI HE SAID MAY BE

43:21.266 --> 43:21.966
WHAT HAPPENED IN MIRAMAR WHICH

43:22.033 --> 43:24.900
IS THE FORMER COUNTRY WHICH WAS

43:24.966 --> 43:27.033
A MILITARY COUP SHOULD HAPPEN

43:27.100 --> 43:27.500
HERE.

43:27.566 --> 43:29.433
THIS IS A FORMER NATIONAL

43:29.500 --> 43:30.866
SECURITY ADVISOR ASKING FOR THE

43:30.933 --> 43:33.033
OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT.

43:33.100 --> 43:33.800
AGAIN, BIDEN SAYING DEMOCRACY IS

43:33.866 --> 43:36.200
IMPERIAL BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING?

43:36.266 --> 43:38.400
WE JUST LET THIS PASS?

43:38.466 --> 43:39.333
WE WHISTLE PAST THIS GRAVEYARD?

43:39.400 --> 43:41.333
>> LIKE A STORY OF THE DAY AND

43:41.400 --> 43:41.766
THEN MOVE ON.

43:41.833 --> 43:45.200
BUT A NATURAL TRANSITION HERE.

43:45.266 --> 43:47.600
TRUMP SAYS PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS A

43:47.666 --> 43:50.400
FAKE, AND THEN HE SAID JOE BIDEN

43:50.466 --> 43:51.566
IS A FAKE.

43:51.633 --> 43:53.000
IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S CALLED FOR

43:53.066 --> 43:54.766
AND OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND

43:54.833 --> 43:56.700
MANY OTHER WAYS LIKE GOING TO

43:56.766 --> 44:02.800
THE CAPITOL ON GENER JANUARY 6T.

44:02.866 --> 44:05.100
WHY DON'T WE HAVE A COUP?

44:05.166 --> 44:07.400
IT'S NOT LIKE MICHAEL FLYNN'S

44:07.466 --> 44:08.800
ARE A CREATIVE WRITER, HE'S

44:08.866 --> 44:09.866
FOLLOWING THE SCRIPT AT TRUMP

44:09.933 --> 44:10.400
ROAD ROAD.

44:10.466 --> 44:11.200
OF >> Bill: RIGHTS, AND AGAIN,

44:11.266 --> 44:15.233
THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT I THINK

44:15.300 --> 44:16.333
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YOU'RE

44:16.400 --> 44:17.300
FIGHTING THE LAST WAR OVER.

44:17.366 --> 44:19.533
WE ARE NOT IN THIS PLACE WHERE I

44:19.600 --> 44:20.466
MEAN IF THIS IS TEN YEARS AGO

44:20.533 --> 44:25.066
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT

44:25.133 --> 44:25.566
ISSUE BECAUSE REASONABLE

44:25.633 --> 44:27.133
DEMOCRATS, THE REASONABLE

44:27.200 --> 44:30.266
REPUBLICAN, WE ARE NOT THERE.

44:30.333 --> 44:31.866
IT'S ONE SIDE THINKS THAT THE

44:31.933 --> 44:33.666
OTHER SIDE IS AN EXISTENTIAL

44:33.733 --> 44:33.900
THREAT.

44:33.966 --> 44:36.633
THEY GOT IT INTO THEIR HEADS

44:36.700 --> 44:39.366
THAT WE ARE SATANIC BABY EATERS.

44:39.433 --> 44:42.666
I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- I MEAN, 18,

44:42.733 --> 44:43.333
YES, EATING PEOPLE ARE RUNNING

44:43.400 --> 44:44.800
NOW FOR CONGRESS.

44:44.866 --> 44:48.666
WHO ARE QUEUING ON.

44:48.733 --> 44:51.400
TAYLOR GREEN WHO IS ABOUT ONE

44:51.466 --> 44:51.966
MOOD SWING AWAY FROM GETTING

44:52.033 --> 44:56.300
NAKED IN TARGET IS GOING TO BE

44:56.366 --> 44:59.133
THE LEADER OF A CULT.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.900
IT'S GOING TO BE A Q1 NONCAUCUS.

45:01.966 --> 45:02.433
HOW DO YOU NEGOTIATE WITH

45:02.500 --> 45:06.233
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE?

45:06.300 --> 45:07.300
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN

45:07.366 --> 45:07.566
WOULD'VE.

45:07.633 --> 45:11.366
>> I WOULD HAVE DONE IT.

45:11.433 --> 45:12.800
BY THE WAY, SOMETHING THAT

45:12.866 --> 45:15.000
CANNOT BE UNSAID HERE AND THAT

45:15.066 --> 45:17.066
IS BIDEN WALKS A TIGHT ROPE.

45:17.133 --> 45:19.800
BECAUSE BIDEN GOES TOO FAR AND

45:19.866 --> 45:20.933
GIVES TOO MUCH TO REPUBLICANS

45:21.000 --> 45:26.100
THE LEFT GOES CRAZY THAN ALL THE

45:26.166 --> 45:28.700
THINGS WILL COME TUMBLING DOWN.

45:28.766 --> 45:30.566
HE'S MAKING PROPOSALS AND HE'S

45:30.633 --> 45:31.400
NOT ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THE

45:31.466 --> 45:32.033
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL BECAUSE HE

45:32.100 --> 45:33.966
KNOWS HE CAN ONLY GO SO FAR.

45:34.033 --> 45:36.233
YOU CAN'T LET THEM OFF THE HOOK.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.766
THE HARD LEFT IS A THREAT TO

45:38.833 --> 45:39.933
JOE BIDEN IN TO MAKE SOME

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
VERY -- BIDEN NEVER RAN LIKE

45:42.300 --> 45:44.100
I ENDORSE THE GUY, HE NEVER RAN

45:44.166 --> 45:44.733
WITH THIS HE SAID HE WAS GOING

45:44.800 --> 45:47.366
TO BRING US TOGETHER AND THEY

45:47.433 --> 45:48.700
ARE NOT HAVING ANY KIND OF GOOD

45:48.766 --> 45:49.033
NEGOTIATIONS.

45:49.100 --> 45:50.333
IT'S WRONG.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.600
>> Bill: THE POOH-POOHED LEFT

45:52.666 --> 45:56.033
IS A ALBATROSS.

45:56.100 --> 45:59.500

ALBATROSS.

46:20.100 --> 46:21.633
HE'S GOING TO DO THAT.

46:21.700 --> 46:26.466

48:27.633 --> 48:28.266
ACTUALLY, MAYBE "THE ATLANTIC"

48:28.333 --> 48:31.033
HAS A POINT.

48:31.100 --> 48:32.700
NEW RULE: TRY NOT TO READ TOO

48:32.766 --> 48:34.166
MUCH INTO THE STORY ABOUT THE

48:34.233 --> 48:35.933
PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN SUSPECTED OF

48:36.000 --> 48:37.766
DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND

48:37.833 --> 48:38.466
SLAMMING HER SUV INTO A

48:38.533 --> 48:39.033
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT

48:39.100 --> 48:44.300
CENTER.

48:44.366 --> 48:44.933
[LAUGHTER]

48:45.000 --> 48:46.166
SURE, IT COULD'VE BEEN A CRY FOR

48:46.233 --> 48:46.800
HELP, BUT MAYBE SHE JUST NEEDED

48:46.866 --> 48:52.300
A PLACE TO CRASH.

48:52.366 --> 48:52.566
[LAUGHTER]

48:52.633 --> 48:55.733
[APPLAUSE]

48:55.800 --> 48:56.366
I KNOW.

48:56.433 --> 48:58.400
I'M ON EVERY WEEK.

48:58.466 --> 49:01.400
AND FINALLY, NOW THAT GRADUATION

49:01.466 --> 49:03.266
SEASON HAS ENDED AND WE WON'T BE

49:03.333 --> 49:05.000
SPOILING

49:05.066 --> 49:05.600
ANYONE'S BIG DAY, LET'S TALK

49:05.666 --> 49:06.900
ABOUT WHAT 'HIGHER EDUCATION' IN

49:06.966 --> 49:08.366
AMERICA REALLY IS: A RACKET THAT

49:08.433 --> 49:09.533
SELLS YOU A VERY EXPENSIVE

49:09.600 --> 49:10.066
TICKET TO THE UPPER MIDDLE

49:10.133 --> 49:14.133
CLASS.

49:14.200 --> 49:18.966
[APPLAUSE]

49:19.033 --> 49:20.900
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AMERICAN

49:20.966 --> 49:22.666
FAMILIES PLAN ASKS THE TAXPAYERS

49:22.733 --> 49:25.666
TO PONY UP HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS

49:25.733 --> 49:28.400
SO THAT EVERYONE CAN GO TO

49:28.466 --> 49:29.700
COLLEGE -- AND BILLIONS MORE FOR

49:29.766 --> 49:30.766
SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE SO OUR KIDS

49:30.833 --> 49:32.166
CAN GO TO SCHOOL WHILE WE GO TO

49:32.233 --> 49:37.300
SCHOOL.

49:37.366 --> 49:37.700
[LAUGHTER]

49:37.766 --> 49:38.633
THE THEORY BEING THAT ALL THIS

49:38.700 --> 49:39.200
EDUCATION TRICKLES DOWN AND

49:39.266 --> 49:43.366
EVENTUALLY GETS TO FLORIDA.

49:43.433 --> 49:43.633
[LAUGHTER]

49:43.700 --> 49:47.900
[APPLAUSE]

49:47.966 --> 49:49.333
THE RIGHT IS CALLING BIDEN'S

49:49.400 --> 49:50.700
PLAN SOCIAL ENGINEERING, WHICH

49:50.766 --> 49:52.200
IS OVER THE TOP, BUT BIDEN'S

49:52.266 --> 49:54.866
PLAN IS AN ENDORSEMENT OF A

49:54.933 --> 49:56.966
PARTICULAR IDEA: THAT THE MORE

49:57.033 --> 49:58.633
TIME HUMANS SPEND IN CLASSROOMS

49:58.700 --> 49:59.700
STARING AT BLACKBOARDS, THE

49:59.766 --> 50:01.833
BETTER.

50:01.900 --> 50:03.700
LIBERALS SEE MORE SCHOOL THE WAY

50:03.766 --> 50:04.833
REPUBLICANS SEE TAX CUTS, AS THE

50:04.900 --> 50:08.166
ANSWER TO EVERYTHING.

50:08.233 --> 50:09.400
WE IMAGINE GOING TO COLLEGE IS

50:09.466 --> 50:11.000
THE WAY TO FIGHT INCOME

50:11.066 --> 50:11.666
INEQUALITY, BUT ACTUALLY IT DOES

50:11.733 --> 50:13.266
THE REVERSE.

50:13.333 --> 50:15.433
IF YOU HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE,

50:15.500 --> 50:17.200
YOU MAKE ABOUT 65% MORE THAN

50:17.266 --> 50:18.666
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T, AND WITH A

50:18.733 --> 50:20.066
MASTER'S DEGREE, IT'S MORE LIKE

50:20.133 --> 50:22.833
100% MORE.

50:22.900 --> 50:24.566
AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF

50:24.633 --> 50:25.900
COLLEGE GRADS IS ABOUT HALF WHAT

50:25.966 --> 50:27.766
IT IS FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADS I

50:27.833 --> 50:30.233
KNOW "FREE COLLEGE" IS NOW A

50:30.300 --> 50:32.700
LEFT WING THING, BUT IS IT

50:32.766 --> 50:34.100
REALLY LIBERAL FOR SOMEONE WHO

50:34.166 --> 50:34.733
DOESN'T GO TO COLLEGE AND MAKES

50:34.800 --> 50:37.366
LESS MONEY, TO PAY FOR PEOPLE

50:37.433 --> 50:42.000
WHO DO GO AND MAKE MORE?

50:42.066 --> 50:43.533
[APPLAUSE]

50:43.600 --> 50:45.666
I'M ASKING.

50:45.733 --> 50:47.400
ESPECIALLY SINCE COLLEGES HAVE

50:47.466 --> 50:48.633
TURNED INTO GIANT, LUXURY

50:48.700 --> 50:50.366
DAYCARE CENTERS WITH OVERPAID

50:50.433 --> 50:52.033
BABYSITTERS ANXIOUS TO INDULGE

50:52.100 --> 50:54.866
EVERY STUDENT WHIM.

50:54.933 --> 50:56.500
THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI HAS A

50:56.566 --> 51:03.966
RIVER GROTTO INSPIRED BY THE

51:04.033 --> 51:05.000
PLAYBOY MANSION.

51:05.066 --> 51:05.600
AND TEXAS TECH

51:05.666 --> 51:06.166
HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST WATER

51:06.233 --> 51:06.900
PARKS IN THE COUNTRY THAT

51:06.966 --> 51:08.533
INCLUDES A 25-PERSON HOT TUB,

51:08.600 --> 51:09.533
TANNING DECK, WATER SLIDE, AND A

51:09.600 --> 51:14.466
"LAZY RIVER."

51:14.533 --> 51:15.433
[LAUGHTER]

51:15.500 --> 51:17.033
A THIRD OF STUDENTS NOW SPEND

51:17.100 --> 51:18.133
LESS THAN FIVE HOURS A WEEK

51:18.200 --> 51:19.933
STUDYING, AND WHEN THEY DO IT'S

51:20.000 --> 51:21.900
FOR THEIR ONEROUS MAGNUM CUM

51:21.966 --> 51:24.066
BULLSHIT COURSE LOAD OF SPORTS

51:24.133 --> 51:27.700
MARKETING, HISTORY THROUGH

TWITTER, ADVANCED RACIST

51:29.500 --> 51:31.100
SPOTTING, INTRO TO

51:31.166 --> 51:32.400
MICRO-AGGRESSIONS AND YOU OWE ME

51:32.466 --> 51:43.300
AN APOLOGY 101.

51:43.366 --> 51:45.200
WHY IS CHINA KICKING OUR ASS?

51:45.266 --> 51:46.866
BECAUSE IN 2019 WE ISSUED MORE

51:46.933 --> 51:49.433
UNDERGRAD DEGREES IN "VISUAL AND

51:49.500 --> 51:52.600
PERFORMING ARTS" THAN COMPUTER

51:52.666 --> 51:55.766
AND INFORMATION SCIENCE OR MATH.

51:55.833 --> 51:57.466
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT LORI

51:57.533 --> 51:58.733
LOUGHLIN, AT LEAST SHE

51:58.800 --> 51:59.333
UNDERSTOOD THAT ONE GOOD SCAM

51:59.400 --> 52:03.900
DESERVES ANOTHER.

52:03.966 --> 52:04.166
[LAUGHTER]

52:04.233 --> 52:07.633
[APPLAUSE]

52:07.700 --> 52:11.166
IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF HER

52:11.233 --> 52:12.300
DAUGHTER OLIVIA JADE "I DON'T

52:12.366 --> 52:14.000
KNOW HOW MUCH SCHOOL I'M GOING

52:14.066 --> 52:14.366
TO ATTEND...

52:14.433 --> 52:16.600
BUT I DO WANT THE EXPERIENCE OF

52:16.666 --> 52:19.533
LIKE, GAME DAYS AND PARTYING."

52:19.600 --> 52:25.533
YEAH, I'M NOT PAYING FOR THAT.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.166
[APPLAUSE]

52:28.233 --> 52:30.166
[LAUGHTER]

52:30.233 --> 52:33.033
IN 1960, COLLEGES AWARDED A'S TO

52:33.100 --> 52:36.033
15% OF THE STUDENTS.

52:36.100 --> 52:37.466
NOW IT'S 45%, AND IT'S NOT

52:37.533 --> 52:40.533
BECAUSE THEY GOT SMARTER.

52:40.600 --> 52:46.600
IT'S BECAUSE OF ADDERALL.

52:46.666 --> 52:48.366
[LAUGHTER]

52:48.433 --> 52:50.366
YEAH, KIND OF.

52:50.433 --> 52:51.266
BUT ALSO, COLLEGES ARE

52:51.333 --> 52:52.033
BUSINESSES SELLING A CONSUMER

52:52.100 --> 52:54.400
PRODUCT FOR HUNDREDS OF

52:54.466 --> 52:55.133
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, AND THEY

52:55.200 --> 52:56.366
WANT TO GIVE THE CUSTOMERS WHAT

52:56.433 --> 52:57.600
THEY WANT, A MAGICAL PIECE OF

52:57.666 --> 53:00.800
PAPER CALLED A DIPLOMA.

53:00.866 --> 53:01.466
BUT THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING OF

53:01.533 --> 53:03.100
THE SCAM.

53:03.166 --> 53:05.900
A WANNABE LIBRARIAN NEEDS A

53:05.966 --> 53:08.066
MASTER'S DEGREE JUST TO GET AN

53:08.133 --> 53:09.333
ENTRY LEVEL JOB FILING BOOKS.

53:09.400 --> 53:12.666
I'VE HEARD THIS SO MANY TIMES

53:12.733 --> 53:13.233
FROM NURSES AND TEACHERS AND

53:13.300 --> 53:15.700
ADMINISTRATORS, ROLLING THEIR

53:15.766 --> 53:16.666
EYES WHEN RELATING HOW THEY

53:16.733 --> 53:18.000
NEEDED TO TAKE SOME BULLSHIT

53:18.066 --> 53:19.766
COURSE IN ORDER TO ADVANCE IN

53:19.833 --> 53:21.500
THEIR FIELD, WHEN REALLY THEY

53:21.566 --> 53:22.133
ALREADY LEARNED WHAT THEY NEED

53:22.200 --> 53:31.866
BY WORKING THE JOB.

53:31.933 --> 53:32.933
BUT IN THE GRIFT THAT IS OUR

53:33.000 --> 53:35.266
HIGHER EDUCATION, WHEN YOU WANT

53:35.333 --> 53:36.033
TO MOVE UP -- HOLD ON THERE, NOT

53:36.100 --> 53:37.266
SO FAST.

53:37.333 --> 53:39.033
TOLL BOOTH AHEAD.

53:39.100 --> 53:40.366
YOU NEED TO PAY FOR MORE

53:40.433 --> 53:41.900
"EDUCATION" BEFORE WE DECIDE IF

53:41.966 --> 53:48.066
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU DO.

53:48.133 --> 53:48.966
FUCK.

53:49.033 --> 53:49.600
THIS IS WHAT SCIENTOLOGY DOES,

53:49.666 --> 53:50.233
MAKES YOU KEEP TAKING "COURSES"

53:50.300 --> 53:50.800
TO MOVE UP TO THE BRIDGE TO

53:50.866 --> 53:52.433
TOTAL FREEDOM.

53:52.500 --> 53:54.500
IN THE MIDDLE AGES, THE CATHOLIC

53:54.566 --> 53:55.466
CHURCH FAMOUSLY SOLD

53:55.533 --> 53:57.133
INDULGENCES, WHICH WERE JUST

53:57.200 --> 53:57.800
TICKETS TO HEAVEN THAT YOU COULD

53:57.866 --> 54:04.300
BUY.

54:04.366 --> 54:04.866
WELL, ANOTHER PRIESTHOOD, OF

54:04.933 --> 54:05.833
ACADEMIA, SELLS A DIFFERENT

54:05.900 --> 54:07.666
TICKET TO HEAVEN, AND BECAUSE

54:07.733 --> 54:09.300
IT'S SO NECESSARY, COLLEGES CAN

54:09.366 --> 54:09.833
CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANT.

54:09.900 --> 54:12.166
SINCE 1985 THE AVERAGE COST OF

54:12.233 --> 54:17.866
COLLEGE HAS RISEN 500%.

54:17.933 --> 54:20.600
IT DOUBLES EVERY NINE YEARS.

54:20.666 --> 54:21.966
EVERY YEAR IT INCREASES AT FOUR

54:22.033 --> 54:24.600
TIMES THE RATE OF INFLATION.

54:24.666 --> 54:25.200
AND YET, NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO

54:25.266 --> 54:26.300
CHANGE A TIRE.

54:26.366 --> 54:26.966
THE ANSWER ISN'T TO MAKE COLLEGE

54:27.033 --> 54:38.400
FREE.

54:38.466 --> 54:39.000
THE ANSWER IS TO MAKE IT MORE

54:39.066 --> 54:41.766
UNNECESSARY.

54:41.833 --> 54:46.100
WHICH IT IS FOR MOST JOBS.

[APPLAUSE]

54:48.100 --> 54:49.866
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

54:49.933 --> 54:51.466
SO THAT THE TWO-THIRDS OF

54:51.533 --> 54:52.900
AMERICANS WHO EITHER CAN'T

54:52.966 --> 54:53.966
AFFORD TO OR JUST DON'T WANT TO

54:54.033 --> 54:56.466
GO DON'T FEEL SHUT OUT.

54:56.533 --> 54:57.533
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE SETS

54:57.600 --> 55:00.500
UP THIS WINNER-LOSER DYNAMIC AND

55:00.566 --> 55:03.733
BREEDS RESENTMENT THAT WORKING

55:03.800 --> 55:10.966
HARD HAS LESS VALUE THAN SITTING

55:11.033 --> 55:13.333
AROUND IN THIS THING, AND THAT

55:13.400 --> 55:15.066
IN TURN FEEDS INTO OUR WIDENING

55:15.133 --> 55:16.700
POLITICAL DIVISION.

55:16.766 --> 55:21.900
OR AS ONE RECENT POLITICIAN PUT

55:21.966 --> 55:25.300

55:27.566 --> 55:27.733

55:27.800 --> 55:28.400
OK, THAT'S OUR SHOW.

55:28.466 --> 55:29.033
