(HARVEY READING)

00:02.294 --> 00:03.500
He's not just suing us.

00:03.586 --> 00:04.827
He's trying to get
a guilty verdict

00:04.922 --> 00:06.128
so he can use it
and come after my license.

00:06.215 --> 00:07.205
What?

00:07.299 --> 00:09.085
Donna was the one
who told you about Simon,

00:09.176 --> 00:10.291
but I want you
to say it was me.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.046
If you can't tell me
who you were to him,

00:12.137 --> 00:14.344
maybe you can tell me
who he is to you.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.421

that he's somebody

00:15.516 --> 00:17.257
that I can't seem to figure
out how to cut out of me.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.342
You knew because
Harvey Specter told you.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.926
| knew because Robert Zane
told me.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.056
Mr. Kessler, who was it?

00:22.147 --> 00:25.105
All I know is that Alex Williams
informed me of Pierpont's plan.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.684
How could you take the fall
for something you didn't do?

00:27.778 --> 00:29.018
How could you do that to me?

00:29.112 --> 00:31.319
Because I did something else,
and I can't live with it anymore.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.567
What are you talking about?

00:32.658 --> 00:34.023
That man that attacked you,

00:34.117 --> 00:36.905
he was killed in his own cell,
and it's my fault.

00:36.995 --> 00:40.238
What am I supposed to do when I
have a big victory or a terrible loss

00:40.332 --> 00:42.323
and the only person I want to
run and tell isn't there?

00:42.417 --> 00:44.704
Samantha, I'm so sorry,
but I have to go.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.059
Say it again.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.947
I looked around,
and you weren't there.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.822
I'm here now.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.074
(INHALES DEEPLY)

01:21.206 --> 01:22.321
What?

01:24.293 --> 01:27.411
| just wish I'd come to
my senses sooner.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.170
It's okay.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.378
| was worth the wait.

01:33.969 --> 01:34.959

We have to get some sleep.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.900
Everything's changed.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.368

02:09.463 --> 02:10.578
Says it's urgent.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.339
This is Samantha Wheeler.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.916
Samantha, it's Katrina.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.048
| got in early this morning,
because I figured we'd have

02:18.138 --> 02:21.506
a lot to take care of with
the whole Robert situation,

02:21.600 --> 02:24.592
which is why I was here
when the call came in and...

02:24.686 --> 02:26.677
Katrina, I'm in the middle of a
workout. Can you just cut to it?

02:26.772 --> 02:30.060
You need to get in here, and
you need to get in here now.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.276
Rachel, call me
as soon as you get this.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.736
It happened.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.611
And by "it," I mean...
Oh, shit, I gotta go.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.279
Who was that?

02:41.370 --> 02:42.485
No one.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.036
Rachel.
Told her, didn't you?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.705
No. Yeah.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.409
Well, in that case, | hope she
listens to her messages before Mike,

02:49.503 --> 02:50.993
'cause I just left
him a doozy.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.580
What? I didn't authorize
you to do that.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.506
Wait, seriously,
what did you tell him?

02:55.634 --> 02:57.671
What'd you tell Rachel? That
you were better the first time.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.547
Good, 'cause that's exactly
what I told Mike about you.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.426
No, you didn't. And neither
did |, because you weren't.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.304
Because more vigorous
isn't necessarily better.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.010
Neither is younger.
Really?

03:07.104 --> 03:09.846
Twelve hours in and you're
gonna trot that one out?

03:09.940 --> 03:13.183
Twelve years in,
and, no, Donna, I'm not...

03:14.695 --> 03:16.936
Because I am glad
| came over last night.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.065
Me, too.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.319
You do know I'm coming over
again tonight, right?

03:21.410 --> 03:24.152
Yeah, Harvey, I do know that.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.037
There is one thing
that I don't know.

03:27.416 --> 03:31.159
What exactly changed
to make you come over here?

But I do know who it is, and it's bad.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.254
How bad?
Louis bad.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.345
He just texted me. He's
right outside. Holy shit.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.679
(SOFTLY) He cannot see me
in here. What are we gonna do?

03:47.769 --> 03:50.261
Well, I can't climb out the window,
if that's what you're suggesting.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.517
We're 12 stories up.
You could stick the landing.

you're in there. Shit.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.606
Wait a minute. What
are we so afraid of?

03:58.697 --> 04:00.404
Harvey, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

04:00.490 --> 04:03.232
| am. Let's let him in.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.611
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

04:10.542 --> 04:13.250
All right, we need to talk,
and we need to talk right now.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.748
| went to Harvey's.
He didn't answer his door,

04:15.839 --> 04:17.704
so now I'm here.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.586
And you're here.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.007
| am.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.048
And you're in the same exact
clothes you were in last night.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.891
Guilty as charged.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.514
Oh, my God.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.767
| know exactly what
you two were doing.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.019
Louis, before you jump...

04:36.109 --> 04:37.144
You were up all night
trying to figure out

04:37.235 --> 04:38.691
how you were gonna handle
the Zane situation.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.524
We were indeed.
Up all night.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.200
Thinking about the situation.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.617
Well, I can't believe it.
You should have called me.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.739
We could have
done it together.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.197
Could have, but it's
probably best that we didn't.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.952
| don't know. They do
say the more the merrier.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.033
Harvey.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.117
You know what, | don't
care that you left me out.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.544
The most important thing is that
you guys were banging it out all night.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.463
That we were.
That we were.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.756
So what'd you come up with?

05:03.386 --> 05:06.003
Probably nothing as helpful
as what you've come up with.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.179
Well, the only thing I know
is that we need to put out

05:08.266 --> 05:10.007
a press release
as soon as possible.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.182
Then you came
to the right place,

05:11.269 --> 05:14.352
because Donna is
top notch at releases.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.897
Why, thank you, Harvey. You
know, you're not so bad yourself.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.940
Will you please stop
stroking each other's egos?

05:19.027 --> 05:21.064
I'm just as good at releasing
as either one of you.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.644
In fact, I hammered one
out this morning.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.774
Don't.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.994
Louis,
this is great.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.666
It takes responsibility while
still standing behind our partner.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.460
So we are agreed.
We stand behind Robert.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.421
We do. Well, then I'll
put this out right away.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.125
And, Harvey, when you get in,
get together with Samantha

05:44.219 --> 05:46.756
and make sure the two of you lock
up every last one of Robert's clients.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.882
I'm on it, Louis.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.517
How could he be
such a good lawyer

06:01.611 --> 06:03.773
and not see what's right
in front of his face?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.400
Well, to be fair,
you didn't see

06:05.490 --> 06:07.822
what was right in front
of your face for 12 years.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.407
Fair enough.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.611
But it does beg
the question...

06:11.705 --> 06:14.037
Let's not tell Louis
or anybody else.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.159
Why not?

06:15.250 --> 06:17.491
Because Louis might be
clueless, but he's right.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.377
There's gonna be a lot of
blowback from the hearing,

06:20.463 --> 06:23.251
and I'd rather share our news
when the people we care about

06:23.341 --> 06:25.332
are in the right frame
of mind to hear it.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.417
About that news.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.129
Before Louis got here,
you asked what had changed.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.012
Harvey, I want to know everything,
and when I do, | want to be able to

06:34.102 --> 06:37.470
hang on every last word,
but now's not the time.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.056
So what do you say
that you go home

06:40.150 --> 06:43.518
and you change into that armor
and you get ready to fight

06:43.612 --> 06:45.023
for Robert's good name?

07:53.056 --> 07:54.638
Depends who's asking.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.967
My name is Stephen Faulkner.
I'm with the New York Bar.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.144
| wanted to talk about what
you did at that hearing yesterday.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.892
| did what anybody
would have done.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.725
All the same, you showed a lot
of courage exposing your partner.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.402
Robert Zane's a legend.
That couldn't have been easy.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.523
It wasn't.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.696
Well, the Bar noticed,
which is why I'm here

08:11.783 --> 08:12.989
to discuss the next step,

08:13.076 --> 08:15.067
removing Zane's name
from your letterhead.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.243
What? Why do we do that?

08:17.330 --> 08:20.038
Because the man broke privilege,
and put your firm in a position

08:20.125 --> 08:21.581
to start hemorrhaging clients.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.705
And since when are our clients
the business of the state bar?

08:23.795 --> 08:25.661
Your clients aren't,
but your firm's character is.

08:25.755 --> 08:26.745
Look,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.420
| know what Robert
did was unethical,

08:30.510 --> 08:33.217
but it was one mistake. We're
talking about a man's legacy.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.422
And leaving his name up doesn't
just hurt the legacy of your firm.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.347
It's hurting the integrity
of the Bar.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.640
And what if I don't see
it that way?

08:39.727 --> 08:41.469
More importantly,
what if my partners don't?

08:41.563 --> 08:42.769
Because it's not my call.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.563
Let's just say it would be
to everyone's benefit

08:44.649 --> 08:46.686
if you and your partners
take that name down

08:46.776 --> 08:47.766
of your own accord.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.050
Samantha, whatever it is,
it'll have to wait.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.726
We have to start locking up
Robert's clients before...

09:22.812 --> 09:23.802
That's why I'm here.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.389
Three of them have already put
their accounts up for review.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.396
Son of a bitch. The Bar just
ruled on Robert yesterday.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.521
It gets worse.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.980
| reached out to six more and
none of them would take my call.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.439
Which means six more
are about to go.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.615
And the only way
that could happen this fast

09:37.702 --> 09:39.739
is if somebody's
already poisoned the well.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.447
You think Hardman's
still after us? I did,

09:42.540 --> 09:45.453
until I saw these notices
were dated two days ago.

09:45.543 --> 09:49.036
And two days ago, Hardman was
gunning to have me disbarred, not Robert.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.165
Exactly.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.463
Then who the hell knew
to go after his clients?

09:52.550 --> 09:54.541
The same man that tried
to blackmail Robert

09:54.636 --> 09:56.252
into taking his name
off our wall.

talking about?

going to pay a visit to Eric Kaldor.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.476
What can I do for you?

10:12.570 --> 10:14.277
Unfortunately, Alex,
I'm here to say

10:14.364 --> 10:17.072
that there's no longer
anything you can do for me.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.483
You're putting us in review.
Not in review.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.612
I'm letting you go.

10:21.913 --> 10:22.948
Thomas...
No, look,

10:23.039 --> 10:24.074
let me save you
whatever you're gonna say,

10:24.165 --> 10:26.156
because I'm not interested
in your excuses.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.118
You're my lawyer. You knew
something, and you kept it from me.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.586
We've been over this. The reason
I... What we haven't been over

10:31.673 --> 10:33.755
is that I was forced
to lie yesterday.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.252

10:35.343 --> 10:37.129
You can't make this better,

Every time I come here, I'm gonna be
thinking about everything that happened.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.389
I can't live that way.
I'm sorry.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.966
Then let me at least say this.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.223
I appreciate what you did,

10:47.313 --> 10:49.645
and I'm sorry
it turned out this way.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.856
That makes two of us.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.870
Harvey Specter and Samantha.

11:09.961 --> 11:10.951
Wow.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.578
I figured you guys
would be, uh, too busy

11:13.673 --> 11:16.131
cleaning up Robert's mess
to come play hockey.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.833
Cut the shit, Eric.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.009
We know you're going after
Robert's clients.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.382
It's funny, when I first
started whispering

11:21.472 --> 11:23.179
that Robert was stepping down,
nobody believed me,

11:23.266 --> 11:25.382
but now they think
I'm a regular Nostradamus.

11:25.476 --> 11:28.889
And if you think we're just gonna
stand by and let you raid our kitchen,

11:28.980 --> 11:31.563
you've been checked into
the boards one too many times.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.266
I think I cannot believe
that she's fighting your fight.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.692
It's not his fight, Eric.
It's all of ours.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.860
Yeah, if you say so.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.358
But if it wasn't for
old Harvey here,

11:39.449 --> 11:41.235
Robert's clients
would still be at your firm.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.567
And in case you hadn't
noticed, so would Robert.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.323
And you can try to drive a
wedge between us all you want.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.572
It's not gonna work. So why
don't you go ahead and tell us,

11:48.666 --> 11:50.873
what's it gonna take for you
to back off Robert's clients?

11:50.960 --> 11:53.998
Well, you know, if I can't drive
a wedge, I can't drive a wedge.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.251
But what it's gonna take for
me to back off your hero's clients

11:57.342 --> 12:00.084
is for old Harvey here
to give me 10 of his.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.467
Ooh! Look at that.
Maybe I did drive a wedge.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.642
You keep hitching your wagon
to the wrong man, sweet pea.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.847
You didn't drive a wedge
between anything, you piece of shit.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.558
Call me "sweet pea" one more
fucking time.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.864
You're probably gonna
want to think about my offer

12:22.951 --> 12:25.488
before you say no. But don't
take too long, all right?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.114
And if you lay a hand
on me one more time,

12:27.205 --> 12:30.664
I'll have you thrown out of the Bar
faster than your disgraced mentor.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.169
(DOOR SHUTS)

12:41.469 --> 12:43.460
Alex, hey, just the man
I was about to see.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.919
Listen, Harvey and Samantha,

12:45.014 --> 12:46.425
they're working
on keeping Robert's clients,

12:46.516 --> 12:48.632
but they may need some backup.
I want you to be ready.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.216
Well, Louis, I don't know
how ready I'll be

12:50.311 --> 12:51.676
when I can't even keep
my own clients.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.728
What?
Kessler just left us.

12:53.815 --> 12:54.850
Shit.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.691
Well, this isn't over.
I'll just give him a call.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.063
You're not gonna be able
to change his mind, Louis.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.188
How do you know that?

13:00.280 --> 13:03.398
Because Harvey used up all of our goodwill
when he asked him to goddamn lie for us.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.981
Alex, I know you're upset
about losing a client,

13:05.076 --> 13:06.692
but it's not exactly news
that Harvey did that.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.527
That's what I'm trying to tell
you, Louis.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.612
I got approached today
by the New York Bar.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.745
It was off the record, but
the guy pretty much told me

13:13.835 --> 13:16.452
if we don't take Zane's name
down, they'll do it for us.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.958
Bullshit, they don't have
the authority to do that.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.255
And if you're suggesting
that we should do it anyway...

13:21.342 --> 13:22.503
You think I want to take
his name down?

13:22.593 --> 13:23.924
Well, then what are you
so worked up about, Alex?

13:24.012 --> 13:26.299
Because in the past two hours,
I've been punched in the gut twice,

13:26.389 --> 13:27.424
and I want to do
something about it.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.550
Well, I don't know
what to do about Thomas,

13:28.641 --> 13:30.223
but I sure as hell know what
to do about the other thing.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.345
What's that?

13:31.436 --> 13:32.926
I wanna check to see
how bad our reputation is.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.012
You're gonna make sure that
they don't have the authority

13:35.106 --> 13:36.267
to take that name down,

13:36.357 --> 13:39.475
and then we're gonna tell the
New York Bar to go fuck themselves.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.149
I've gotta say, I've never
seen you like that before.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.859
I thought you were
gonna kill him.,

13:48.953 --> 13:50.739
If you hadn't been there,
I just might have.

13:51.289 --> 13:54.327
Well, I appreciate you not
letting him drive that wedge.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.705
I know you must have been
tempted by his offer because of...

13:57.795 --> 13:59.377
I wasn't tempted, Harvey.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.954
If Robert taught me anything,

14:01.049 --> 14:03.507
it's that when a teammate
is being attacked,

14:03.593 --> 14:05.004
you don't leave their side.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.381
No, you don't.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.756
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

14:10.850 --> 14:11.885
Depends on what
you're thinking.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.762
I'm thinking that when
a teammate's under attack,

14:13.853 --> 14:16.436
you don't just stand by them.
You turn the tables.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.184
Because the best defense
is a good offense.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.891
Exactly.
(CHUCKLES)

14:21.402 --> 14:22.437
What?

14:23.696 --> 14:27.735
I was just thinking, I must have said
that to Mike Ross about a thousand times.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.533
Jesus, last night it was
Jessica, tonight it's Mike Ross.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.402
Am I gonna have to hear
stories about him now, too?

14:32.497 --> 14:35.910
What I meant was, I keep getting
reminded of how alike we are.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.085
Well, here's to going
on offense.

14:40.171 --> 14:41.457
To going on offense.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.468
Speaking of last night...
What about it?

14:48.554 --> 14:51.046
I know I said I didn't need
you checking up on me,

14:51.140 --> 14:52.426
but you did anyway.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.806
And the truth is,
I appreciated it.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.853
Because I was hurting.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.020
But?
But then you just up and left.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.523
What happened?

15:05.613 --> 15:07.195
I know how that
must have seemed,

15:08.408 --> 15:09.990
but I was hurting, too.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.612
And then,

15:13.579 --> 15:14.740
all of a sudden...

15:16.541 --> 15:17.576
I get it.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.450
You needed to be alone.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.749
Yeah, I did.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.000
But, Samantha, I'm sorry
if I left you in the lurch.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.129
I understand.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.929
It must have been tough, knowing
what Robert gave up for you.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.469
It was.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.560
Which is why tomorrow,
you and I are gonna make sure

15:38.646 --> 15:41.479
the only person giving
anything up is Eric Kaldor.

15:49.574 --> 15:52.487
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

15:53.953 --> 15:56.115
Thomas, hi.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.493
So I'm guessing lunch today
won't work.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.621
I'm sorry I didn't
call you back earlier, Donna.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.293
I had some business matters
to attend to.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.540
You mean like firing us?

16:04.630 --> 16:06.962
What happened with Alex
had nothing to do with us.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.460
It was business.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.134
Well, I wish it hadn't come
to that, but I understand.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.053
And I'm sorry...

16:16.017 --> 16:17.849
For everything...
Please don't say it.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.176
You said everything
there is to say yesterday.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.607
The truth is, I didn't call you back
because I just didn't have it in me

16:26.360 --> 16:27.771
to endure hearing the rest.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.194
Thomas, listen to me,
you are such a good man...

16:30.281 --> 16:31.817
You don't have to
soft-pedal it, Donna.

16:31.908 --> 16:35.617
Nobody goes from spending
their nights together to lunch.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.575
There are so many things
I want to say about you.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.202
Maybe another time.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.752
Take care, Thomas.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.580
Goodbye, Donna.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.214
There's my love. I hope you're
in the mood for your favorite,

16:57.308 --> 16:59.549
'cause this matzo's
about to get brei'd.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.679
That sounds amazing.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.848
Tough day?

17:03.689 --> 17:05.521
Yeah, you could say that.

17:05.691 --> 17:09.150
The Bar wants us
to take Robert's name down.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.819
But before I tell them
to go to hell...

17:10.905 --> 17:12.646
You need to know
if you can afford to.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.981
That's why you're making
matzo brei. You know.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.405
How bad is it?

17:20.289 --> 17:22.906
The students that were hoping
to interview with you this year

17:23.000 --> 17:24.582
pulled their résumés back.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.251
I overheard some
of them talking.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.499
They said if you're not
willing to distance yourself

17:28.589 --> 17:30.626
from someone who's
been disbarred,

17:31.551 --> 17:34.043
then you don't care about
the reputation of your firm.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.505
They said that?

17:35.763 --> 17:38.255
Louis, maybe it's time
for you to consider.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.340
No, I can't do it.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.300
Why not? You took
Jessica's name down.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.557
Yeah, that was different.
She knew about Mike.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.604
She was guilty.
But Rob...

17:47.358 --> 17:48.348
Robert, what?

17:51.988 --> 17:54.571
What I'm about to tell you
stays between these walls.

17:54.657 --> 17:55.738
It wasn't Robert.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.737
It was Harvey. More
specifically, it was Donna.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.069
What? Oh, my God.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.872
Exactly. The man took
a huge bullet for us, Sheila.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.950
I'm not just gonna rip
his name down now.

18:07.044 --> 18:10.002
Okay, Louis, Harvey
and Donna or not,

18:10.089 --> 18:11.955
the world thinks
it was Robert.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.255
You don't have a choice.

18:13.342 --> 18:17.757
Sheila, when our child grows up
and asks me how to make decisions,

18:17.847 --> 18:19.053
I'm not going to say,

18:19.140 --> 18:21.347
"Take the way out
that protects your reputation

18:21.434 --> 18:22.595
"at the cost
of your character."

18:22.685 --> 18:24.221
And I understand all of that,

18:24.312 --> 18:26.178
but you asked me
how bad it was,

18:26.272 --> 18:28.730
and the truth is,
if I didn't know you

18:28.816 --> 18:31.023
and I had heard what
had happened,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.192
I'd be feeling the same way
my students do.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.446
(LINE RINGING)

18:42.455 --> 18:43.945
DONNA: Hey.
Hey.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.956
Let me guess. You can't come
over tonight.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.078
How'd you know?

18:49.211 --> 18:52.124
Because I know Robert's clients
haven't been locked down yet,

18:52.214 --> 18:55.548
and I'm the one who told you
to put on your armor.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.627
Have I ever told you how
much I love it when you do that?

18:58.721 --> 19:01.429
No, but I knew it anyway.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.756
See what I did there?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.052
Hey, what's going on?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.809
Samantha asked what
happened to me last night.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.311
I didn't know what to say.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.732
So what did you say?

19:14.737 --> 19:18.901
She assumed I wanted to
be alone, so I let her think that.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.234
That's not true. I didn't
just let her think that.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.411
I lied to her.
I told her she was right.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.910
Well that's not ideal,
but I know

19:28.000 --> 19:30.241
what it's like to be having
a tough conversation

19:30.336 --> 19:31.371
and not wanna say something

19:31.462 --> 19:33.499
that's gonna hurt
the other person even more.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.579
Did something happen?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.164
Thomas and I ended it tonight.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.467
Oh, my God. Donna, I didn't
know that you two were still together.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.260
I would never have...
Listen to me.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.088
It was already over,
and he knew it.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.423
Are you sure?
I'm sure.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.681
Harvey, you didn't do
anything wrong. I swear.

19:50.898 --> 19:51.933
Thanks.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.392
SAMANTHA: All right, you ready to
do a deep dive into Kaldor's clients?

19:55.486 --> 19:57.853
Well, as long as
we're going after Kaldor's,

19:57.947 --> 20:00.860
what do you say we also
go after Ellen Rand's?

20:00.950 --> 20:03.157
What do you think
this pile is?

20:03.244 --> 20:04.279
Louis.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.953
It's been too long.
LOUIS: It has.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.622
But I'm sorry to say, Henry,
this is not a social call.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.747
I'm guessing this has something
to do with Robert's disbarment.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.874
I just discovered,
as of today,

20:14.964 --> 20:18.173
we do not have one single applicant
from any of the top 10 schools,

20:18.259 --> 20:19.624
and I was hoping that
you could help us change that

20:19.719 --> 20:21.801
by steering some
students our way.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.380
Because, as you know, if
Harvard comes, the rest follow.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.306
Louis, I'm not a recruiter.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.225
But when you suggest
something, Henry,

20:29.311 --> 20:30.301
the students listen.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.728
Except they don't come
to me for things like that.

20:32.815 --> 20:36.274
That's fine, I can come to them. You
have an ethics conference coming up.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.816
Let me be the keynote speaker.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.487
Louis, the university
has approval of all speakers.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.946
There's no way they're gonna
let you be keynote right now.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.400
Professor, please, I...

20:48.456 --> 20:51.289
I have nowhere else to turn.
I need your help.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.665
All right, Louis.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.827
I'll try.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.463
But if I'm gonna
vouch for you,

20:59.133 --> 21:00.874
I want you to tell me
what happened.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.505
Because Robert undercutting
you just to get even?

21:03.596 --> 21:04.631
I don't buy it.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.759
Well, if you could figure out
that Robert wouldn't do this,

21:06.849 --> 21:09.090
you could figure out
the truth for yourself.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.550
Harvey.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.598
Louis,

21:13.439 --> 21:15.146
how could this happen
on your watch?

21:15.232 --> 21:16.267
You know what, Henry?

21:16.358 --> 21:18.474
Shit's happened
on your watch, too.

21:18.569 --> 21:21.652
Shit that you did, and
we helped you get out of it.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.321
Louis,
I'm not criticizing you.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.818
I'm concerned about you.

21:24.909 --> 21:28.118
Well, then why don't you concern
yourself with what I just asked of you?

21:28.204 --> 21:30.616
And concern yourself with it
before the end of the week.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.080
You won't just be signing
the best legal team in the city.

21:41.175 --> 21:45.214
You'll also be gaining access to
our network of high-powered clients.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.754
Clients like this one,

21:47.848 --> 21:50.465
who would love to finance
your Singapore expansion.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.176
Ms. Wheeler, I didn't
get to where I am today

21:53.270 --> 21:54.726
by turning down a free lunch,

21:55.272 --> 21:57.809
but I'm starting to think
that you're wasting my time.

21:57.900 --> 21:58.890
How so?

21:58.984 --> 22:01.476
By not acknowledging your
firm's Robert Zane problem.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.776
What Robert Zane problem?

22:02.863 --> 22:05.150
Look, I like Robert,
but I can't sell this move.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.573
To my board,
Zane is a four-letter word.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.867
Robert's disbarment
doesn't reflect

22:09.954 --> 22:11.115
the culture at our firm.

22:11.205 --> 22:12.445
Then why aren't you taking
his name down?

22:12.540 --> 22:14.122
Because, you gotta
understand the history.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.915
The only thing
I have to understand

22:16.001 --> 22:19.210
is that keeping Zane's name
up sends the signal

22:19.296 --> 22:21.037
that you stand by
what he did.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.292
We do stand by him.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.378
He was a great lawyer
and an even better man,

22:25.469 --> 22:27.506
and the Bar's decision
doesn't change that.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.883
Then I'll be blunt.
His name is only half of it.

22:29.974 --> 22:31.590
It's also a matter
of his people.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.719
What do you mean,
"his people"?

22:32.810 --> 22:35.973
One of your partners came from
the Robert Zane coaching tree.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.680
And you know what they say about
trees and apples and all that shit.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.230
What are you trying to say?
I'm saying...

22:40.317 --> 22:42.399
That the only way
we'd ever consider signing

22:42.486 --> 22:44.397
is if you were to let
Ms. Wheeler go as well.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.523
Well, that's not gonna happen.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.400
I'm not going anywhere.
Then I wish you luck.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.573
But there is no way

22:49.660 --> 22:51.697
we're leaving Rand Kaldor
to sign with you.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.949
And if you think anyone
else will,

22:54.081 --> 22:56.368
you're not the lawyer
I've always heard you were.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.549
Harvey, where are you?
I struck out.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.004
If we don't come up
with something,

23:12.099 --> 23:14.682
we might as well give Eric
the keys to Robert's house,

23:14.768 --> 23:17.806
because he sure as hell is
gonna end up with all of his clients.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.637
(SIGHS)

23:19.732 --> 23:22.144
Samantha, how's it going
with Zane's roster?

23:22.234 --> 23:24.020
At the moment,
it's not going at all.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.523
All right, listen to me.
Our reputation took a hit.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.527
But if the clients people most
expect to leave decide to stay,

23:29.617 --> 23:32.154
it's gonna send a message to the
world that we can still be trusted.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.450
I don't know what to
tell you, Louis.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.655
We had a plan to go on offense
and it's not working out on my end.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.285
What about Harvey?
I don't know.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.452
What do you mean,
you don't know? I mean,

23:39.543 --> 23:41.659
I have been breaking my back
to get this done

23:41.754 --> 23:44.587
and I can't even reach Harvey,
which makes me wonder

23:44.673 --> 23:46.664
if he even gives a shit
about this at all.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.421
Don't you say that. The night it
happened, he did not sleep a wink

23:49.511 --> 23:52.629
because he was up all night at
Donna's trying to figure out what to do.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.472
Was he, now?
Yeah, he was.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.019
Well, that is good to know.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.690
In fact, you might have
just given me an idea

24:04.777 --> 24:07.109
about how we can keep
Robert's clients after all.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.112
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

24:13.661 --> 24:15.117
Hello?
STEPHEN: Alex.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.694
Stephen Faulkner.
How are you?

24:16.789 --> 24:19.281
To tell you the truth, Stephen,
better than I was yesterday.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.706
Because I looked into
whether you had precedent

24:20.793 --> 24:22.454
to make us remove
Robert's name,

24:22.544 --> 24:24.080
and what do you know?

24:24.171 --> 24:26.208
You don't.
Is that a fact?

24:26.298 --> 24:27.333
It is.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.378
Seven years ago, another firm
had a partner disbarred

24:30.469 --> 24:32.676
and you didn't just let them
leave up his name.

24:32.763 --> 24:34.049
You let them leave up
his bio, too.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.425
Since we're
talking about bios,

24:35.516 --> 24:36.881
let's talk about yours.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.967
Because I'm not just calling
to check in.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.935
I'm calling to make
you an offer.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.555
Become managing partner.

24:44.942 --> 24:46.558
What?
That's right.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.689
We may not have authority
to make you change your name,

24:48.779 --> 24:52.864
but we do have authority to make changes
to a firm's leadership when it fails.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.907
Bullshit.
Don't believe me? Look it up.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.325
You seem to like doing that.

24:56.412 --> 24:57.868
What I like are my partners,

24:57.955 --> 24:59.571
and there's no way I
would ever betray Louis Litt.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.826
Alex, if you don't
take action,

25:00.916 --> 25:02.202
there will be consequences.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.374
There have already been
consequences, Steve.

25:04.461 --> 25:07.579
And you came to me with two proposals,
so let me give you my two answers.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.584
Go to hell
and go fuck yourself.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.083
(DISCONNECTS PHONE)

25:27.443 --> 25:29.354
You get my message?
Yeah, I did.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.186
Good. So nice
of you to return.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.237
I didn't return your call
because I've been a little busy

25:33.365 --> 25:35.606
trying to come back with
some good news. And?

25:36.368 --> 25:38.234
Look, Samantha...
That's what I thought.

25:38.328 --> 25:39.363
Well, it doesn't
matter anyway,

25:39.455 --> 25:41.037
because we're gonna give
Eric what he wants.

25:41.123 --> 25:43.285
Robert's clients?
We can't do that.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.833
Not his clients,
Harvey. Yours.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.705
What happened
to "teammates don't do that"?

25:47.796 --> 25:49.457
Things change.
Like what?

25:49.548 --> 25:51.209
Why don't you ask
your girlfriend?

25:52.468 --> 25:55.381
I don't know what you're
talking about. Like hell you don't.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.592
You didn't leave the
other night to go be alone.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.593
You left to be with Donna.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.470
And Louis might buy
that bullshit

26:02.561 --> 26:05.178
about you being up all night
talking about what to do,

26:05.272 --> 26:08.435
but I know talking
is not what you were up to.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.515
Samantha, listen to me...

26:09.610 --> 26:11.317
Why don't we skip the part
where you try to explain

26:11.403 --> 26:14.816
why you lied to me and get to the
part where you give Eric your clients?

26:14.907 --> 26:16.523
First of all,
you have no idea

26:16.617 --> 26:19.109
what happened between me
and Donna the other night.

26:19.203 --> 26:22.446
Second of all, I don't believe
you're asking me to give up my clients

26:22.539 --> 26:25.577
because you're,
what, jealous?

26:25.667 --> 26:27.658
You think this is
because I'm jealous?

26:27.753 --> 26:29.243
Then what the hell
is it about?

26:29.338 --> 26:32.000
I lost everything
that night.

26:32.091 --> 26:35.459
Robert was everything to me,

26:35.552 --> 26:37.793
and the person I lost him
for was you.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.300
And instead of feeling bad
about it like you said you did,

26:40.390 --> 26:43.758
you were off having a little romp with
the person whose fault it really was.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.514
So give up your clients or
don't, but if your answer is no,

26:46.605 --> 26:48.516
I'm gonna put you
through that wall.

26:58.534 --> 26:59.865
(TAPPING)

27:00.994 --> 27:03.156
Yes, may I help you?
Katrina Bennett.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.204
I'm Sheila Sazs.
Sheila.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.157
Yes, we meet at last.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.617
Indeed we do.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.962
And I must say, it is...
Save it.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.039
You don't like me.
I don't like you.

27:15.134 --> 27:19.128
But we both would kill for
Louis, and I respect that.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.302
I'm listening.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.756
This firm's in trouble,
and I won't let it go down

27:22.850 --> 27:24.557
while my captain
is at its helm.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.476
You're talking about the
ramifications of Robert leaving.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.681
I'm talking about no one trusting
you while his name is on that wall.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.356
I always admired Robert.

27:33.068 --> 27:36.811
But if I'm being honest, I had my
doubts about leaving his name up.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.441
Then I was right
to come to you.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.364
And you think he'll hear it
better if it comes from me?

27:40.450 --> 27:43.238
I don't care how he hears it.
It just needs to get done.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.745
Then it will.
Good.

27:45.831 --> 27:49.199
But don't mention my coming here.
I told him I had book club tonight.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.450
What are you saying you read?
Eat Pray Love.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.832
Good choice, except that
is the kind of thing

27:53.922 --> 27:56.789
he'll want to read with you,
assuming he hasn't read it already.

27:56.884 --> 27:59.967
Oh, God, you're right.
I suggest Amazons.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.885
It's about hockey.
He'll never pick it up.

28:01.972 --> 28:03.508
Perhaps I might like you
after all.

28:03.599 --> 28:07.388
I have to admit, when I
look at you, I see myself.

28:07.477 --> 28:11.562
Though more attractive with
far less sexual magnetism.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.431
Why would you say that to me?

28:14.526 --> 28:16.233
Because I'm starting
to care about you,

28:16.320 --> 28:18.482
and truth be told,
your beauty's a turnoff.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.529
Friendly advice,

28:20.616 --> 28:22.698
you might want to
frump it up a bit.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.416
Remember that thing
about not telling anyone?

28:32.502 --> 28:33.788
Samantha knows.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.870
And from that look on your
face, she's not taking it well.

28:36.006 --> 28:38.043
She's not taking anything
well. Let me guess,

28:38.133 --> 28:40.795
she just lost the most important
person in her life, and then she finds out

28:40.886 --> 28:43.048
that the night it happened,
we're off having a party.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.173
Yeah, something like that.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.629
Well, you can't really
blame her for that, can you?

28:45.724 --> 28:46.714
No, not for that.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.092
But I can sure as hell blame
her for the things she said.

28:50.187 --> 28:51.222
How bad?
Bad.

28:51.313 --> 28:52.974
I'm telling you,
if she weren't a woman...

28:53.065 --> 28:55.102
Harvey, if there is one thing
I know about Samantha,

28:55.192 --> 28:56.933
it's that she wouldn't want
you to treat her differently

28:57.027 --> 28:58.108
because she's a woman.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.185
What are you saying?

28:59.279 --> 29:00.895
I'm saying it sounds like
she's spoiling for a fight.

29:00.989 --> 29:04.152
And sometimes when somebody wants a fight,
you have no choice but to give it to them.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.735
I am not getting in the ring
with Samantha.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.909
Yes, you are.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.621
She boxes every morning.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.948
You go in there tomorrow, you
let her get it out of her system.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.034
Are you nuts?
I'm not hitting a woman.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.995
If I were you, I'd be more
worried about losing to that woman.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.330
I am not losing to anyone!

29:19.424 --> 29:21.165
Harvey, she has
military training.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.469
Louis said that she put down his
mugger in about five seconds flat,

29:24.554 --> 29:28.263
and from what I know about fighting,
the more pissed off person usually wins.

29:30.519 --> 29:31.930
Harvey, listen to me.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.681
She needs this
just like you would.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.103
So if you're not willing
to give it to her,

29:35.190 --> 29:36.931
that's not looking out
for her.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.732
That's just disrespecting her.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.417
Whatever it is,
I am tired of talking.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.212
We're not talking.
We're going right now.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.461
I'm not fighting you.
Yeah, you are.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.633
You've been talking about it
since the day you got here.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.382
Now you're pissed, and you said
you wanted to put me through a wall.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.883
Well, here I am.
You're damn right,

30:08.974 --> 30:10.715
I want to put you through
a wall, but not today.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.470
You feel awful
about what you did,

30:12.561 --> 30:15.144
and I don't want any excuses
when I kick your ass.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.471
There aren't gonna be any excuses
because I'm not gonna need them.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.432
Get out of my face.
I'm not going anywhere.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.516
Watch yourself.

30:20.610 --> 30:23.318
You're in the ring with the man who's
responsible for disbarring your mentor.

30:23.405 --> 30:24.440
I'm warning you...

30:24.531 --> 30:25.737
The man who put his needs
in front of yours.

30:25.824 --> 30:26.859
You don't want to do this.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.782
The man who decided his love
life was more import...

30:33.707 --> 30:35.744
I guess it's on.
Yes, it is.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.833
(SAMANTHA GRUNTS)

30:50.098 --> 30:51.304
(CHUCKLES)

30:52.684 --> 30:53.719
Ready to be done?

30:53.810 --> 30:55.676
Oh, I'm just getting started.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.030
Katrina, what are you
doing here so early?

31:12.120 --> 31:16.364
I need to talk to you, and I need it to be
before this place is crawling with people.

31:16.458 --> 31:19.120
Okay, what is it?

31:19.211 --> 31:21.373
It's what everyone in this
firm knows has to be done

31:21.463 --> 31:23.579
and no one seems willing
to tell Louis.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.207
You mean taking Zane's name
down? Yes, that's what I mean.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.917
He's not gonna want to do it.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.467
You think I do?

31:29.554 --> 31:31.090
But the longer we leave
his name up there,

31:31.181 --> 31:33.843
the more damage
we inflict on ourselves.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.013
See that right there?

31:37.104 --> 31:39.562
You know what I mean.
So what if I do?

31:39.648 --> 31:41.980
Why are you coming to me
and not Harvey or Donna?

31:42.067 --> 31:43.683
Because it's going to come
down to a vote,

31:43.777 --> 31:45.893
and without you and Louis
pushing the others,

31:45.987 --> 31:47.022
it's never going to happen.

31:47.697 --> 31:51.440
And if that's not good enough,
because you owe me.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.492
No, you're not calling
that in for this.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.660
Did you think I was gonna
ask you to wash my car?

31:56.415 --> 32:00.033
Alex, you know this is
the right thing to do.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.743
What the hell is stopping you?

32:01.837 --> 32:03.828
He didn't do it, Katrina.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.917
Robert didn't do it.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.044
For what it's worth,
I didn't think he did.

32:09.010 --> 32:14.130
But that doesn't matter,
because he said he did.

32:16.393 --> 32:17.474
All right.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.390
I'll get Louis to agree.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.527
I'm surprised you have
the strength to pick that up.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.728
Me?

32:29.823 --> 32:32.656
I'm surprised you can sit
after I kicked your ass.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.154
You didn't kick anything,
but I'll admit,

32:35.245 --> 32:38.158
you did pretty good
for a guy in his 70s.

32:38.248 --> 32:39.363
Hey, those are fighting words.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.870
You wanna go again?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.075
Me neither.

32:44.171 --> 32:48.881
Look, if you want me to give
up my clients to Kaldor, I will.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.129
But is that what
Robert would want?

32:51.470 --> 32:53.381
(SIGHS) No.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.305
It's not what I want, either.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.552
Then what is?

32:59.186 --> 33:00.642
We fight for his clients.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.097
We keep who we can keep, but
his name stays up no matter what.

33:04.191 --> 33:05.556
I can live with that.

33:06.776 --> 33:07.811
So can I.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

33:16.453 --> 33:18.194
Louis.
Henry, hi.

33:18.288 --> 33:19.619
Thanks for getting back
to me so soon.

33:19.706 --> 33:23.290
Listen, I...
About what I said earlier...

33:23.376 --> 33:26.994
Don't give it another thought. I
understand you're under a lot of stress.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.045
And I'm sorry to say
I'm about to add to it.

33:29.132 --> 33:32.124
Don't tell me, they said I'm not
welcome as keynote speaker.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.630
Even if they didn't, Louis,

33:33.720 --> 33:35.381
Harvard students
are not going to be fooled

33:35.472 --> 33:39.181
by some speech. They're
going to respond to your actions.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.349
Damn it, I'm taking
every action I can think of.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.471
No, Louis,

33:42.562 --> 33:46.521
you're bending over backwards to
avoid taking the one action you should.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.400
Thanks for trying, Henry.

33:50.487 --> 33:51.898
Take care, Louis.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.409
You look like you
just got some bad news.

33:59.496 --> 34:00.486
I did.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.866
This thing...

34:02.541 --> 34:04.623
Our reputation,
it's worse than I thought.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.284
Actually,

34:09.005 --> 34:10.996
that's what I'm here
to talk to you about.

34:12.842 --> 34:13.877
No, I'm not doing it.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.176
Louis, even Katrina knows
it's the right thing.

34:16.263 --> 34:17.753
She went to you
behind my back?

34:17.847 --> 34:18.962
She would have come in here
and told you that to your face,

34:19.056 --> 34:20.639
but I didn't give her
the chance.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.715
Why not?
Because I didn't want her

34:21.810 --> 34:24.347
to hear that the Bar tried to get
me to take over as managing partner.

34:24.437 --> 34:27.099
What? They can't do that.
They can, and they have.

34:27.190 --> 34:30.148
In '97, they got a name partner
to step in as managing partner

34:30.235 --> 34:32.101
in exactly the same situation.

34:33.362 --> 34:34.853
You're here to tell me
you're taking over.

34:34.947 --> 34:38.190
I'm here to tell you that if they
can do that, what else can they do?

34:38.284 --> 34:40.025
I don't know.
And I don't want to find out.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.408
It's gonna require a vote.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.580
And we have two right here.
We need three.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.578
You know that Samantha
will not say yes.

34:47.668 --> 34:50.206
And neither will Donna, since
this whole thing started with her.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.588
Harvey.
He's our only chance.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.461
I say we go see him
right now.

34:58.555 --> 35:00.216
I went to him with
something like this before.

35:00.307 --> 35:02.014
He didn't like it then and he
certainly won't like it now.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.592
And I'm telling you,
the only chance we have

35:04.686 --> 35:07.519
of him saying yes
is if I go to see him alone.

35:13.278 --> 35:17.647
Gina, I know Kaldor said that
if you went with them, they'd...

35:17.866 --> 35:19.072
Look...

35:19.618 --> 35:24.203
If it's your final decision,
there's nothing left for me to say.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.499
That was one of Robert's
clients, wasn't it?

35:29.586 --> 35:31.623
What can I say?
You win some. You lose some.

35:31.713 --> 35:33.078
That's why I'm here, Harvey.

35:33.548 --> 35:36.165
Been losing too many, and we
need to put an end to this.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.590
What are you talking about?

35:37.802 --> 35:39.884
I'm talking about
taking Robert's name down.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.336
Not gonna happen.
Harvey...

35:41.431 --> 35:43.342
Damn it, Louis,
I gave Samantha my word!

35:43.433 --> 35:45.094
You said...
I know what I said.

35:45.185 --> 35:47.597
But since then,
the Bar has been up our asses,

35:47.687 --> 35:49.519
clients have been
dropping like flies,

35:49.606 --> 35:53.019
and we are not gonna have any
associates next year if we do not do this.

35:53.109 --> 35:56.818
Now, Alex is with me. That's two
votes. Your vote makes it happen.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.145
SAMANTHA:
Makes what happen, Louis?

35:58.740 --> 36:00.322
Samantha, I was just
explaining to Harvey...

36:00.408 --> 36:01.443
You weren't explaining shit.

36:01.534 --> 36:03.866
You were going behind my back
trying to pull Robert's name down,

36:03.953 --> 36:05.990
and over my dead body
is that gonna happen.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.571
Well, it is not
only up to you.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.249
You gave me your word
that Robert's name stays up.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.996
Did you tell him that?
Yes, I did.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.828
Then what the fuck
is going on here?

36:13.922 --> 36:16.835
What's going is, if we don't
do this, this firm has no future.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.963
Then let me be clear.
If you do this, I'm gone,

36:20.053 --> 36:22.135
and you'll be lucky
if I don't go to the Bar

36:22.222 --> 36:24.304
and tell them what
really happened.

36:29.437 --> 36:30.598
You really think she's
gonna go to the Bar?

36:30.689 --> 36:32.646
I don't know.
Well, God damn it, Harvey,

36:32.732 --> 36:36.851
his name stays up and his clients
go, we might as well just close up shop.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.403
Then we'll just have
to make sure his clients stay.

36:39.489 --> 36:40.524
What the hell
does that mean?

36:40.615 --> 36:42.947
It means we don't need
to take Robert's name down.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.616
We just have to keep
his clients.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.489
Well, we aren't
keeping his clients.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.946
We haven't been,
Louis, but we can.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.582
And I know
just where to start.

37:02.679 --> 37:05.296
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.257
You're backing off,
and you're backing off now.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.474
Whose am I getting,
Robert's or yours?

37:13.565 --> 37:16.353
Wait, don't tell me, don't tell
me. I wanna guess this one.

37:16.443 --> 37:17.478
They're mine.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.560
Wow, I would have totally
gotten that wrong.

37:20.989 --> 37:24.448
You must really be hating this right
now. What did she do to convince you?

37:24.534 --> 37:25.820
Why don't you just take
your win and go home, Eric?

37:25.910 --> 37:27.742
It's no fun winning
if you can't rub it in.

37:27.829 --> 37:29.115
I mean, I knew she had Zane

37:29.205 --> 37:30.741
wrapped around her
little finger, I just didn't...

37:30.832 --> 37:33.449
Finish that sentence, Eric.
Go ahead, finish that sentence.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.001
I'll treat 'em well.
You do that.

37:40.091 --> 37:43.800
And don't you ever say another
word about Robert again.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.433
You trying to decide if you're
gonna kill Louis or not?

37:59.527 --> 38:00.642
(SCOFFS)

38:00.737 --> 38:02.319
It's 50-50.

38:03.823 --> 38:07.282
Well, if it makes any difference,
Rand Kaldor officially backed off.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.819
Harvey gave
his clients to Eric?

38:10.914 --> 38:11.949
He did.

38:13.958 --> 38:17.201
But he still has one more to give
up, and it's one of his favorites.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.545
Brick Street Athletics.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.006
Why?
He wanted to make a gesture.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.750
He did, or you did?

38:26.054 --> 38:28.136
He did, Samantha.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.051
It was 100% his idea.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.053
I just asked if I could be
the one to tell you

38:33.144 --> 38:35.886
because it would give me
a chance to say something

38:35.980 --> 38:37.061
that I need to say.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.354
Donna, you don't have to.

38:38.441 --> 38:41.149
I put myself over the firm,
and it cost you dearly.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.648
And if I'm being honest,
if I could somehow go back

38:43.738 --> 38:46.901
and take it all away,
I don't know if I would.

38:49.619 --> 38:50.859
But I'm sorry.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.618
I am so sorry.
Donna,

38:56.876 --> 38:58.992
he didn't just leave
because of you.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.122
What?

39:03.591 --> 39:06.003
He did something years ago

39:06.511 --> 39:07.546
for me.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.054
It had been eating him up,
and I didn't know about it.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.886
When he left, he told me,
and ever since then...

39:13.977 --> 39:15.684
No wonder you were so upset.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.136
You felt responsible.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.226
He's gone, Donna.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.351
I know.

39:21.901 --> 39:24.643
But for what it's worth, we're
here to pick up the slack.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.870
I imagine you heard about
Zane's name staying up.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.036
I did.
Look,

39:43.339 --> 39:46.172
I know it goes without saying,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.800
I still owe you.

39:48.887 --> 39:52.175
I asked you to convince Louis,
and you did that.

39:53.474 --> 39:54.839
You don't owe me anything.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.889
Well, I might not owe you,

39:58.980 --> 40:01.438
but that doesn't mean
you can't still come knocking.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.600
I guess this means
we're rolling the dice

40:04.694 --> 40:06.810
that keeping Zane's clients
will be enough.

40:08.156 --> 40:09.442
I guess it does.

40:10.575 --> 40:13.818
Alex, I don't mean to pry, but
do you know something I don't?

40:14.579 --> 40:16.035
Nothing worth telling.

40:17.624 --> 40:18.739
'Night, Katrina.

40:25.882 --> 40:26.872
(DOOR OPENS)

40:36.059 --> 40:38.892
I've got to admit, I never
thought I'd see this place again.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.310
Even with the furniture,
it's not the same without him.

40:42.315 --> 40:44.431
Harvey, why did you want me
to meet you here?

40:44.525 --> 40:47.017
Mike asked me to rent it out
for them when they left.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.693
I never did.

40:48.821 --> 40:51.483
Mmm. Well, it must have
cost them a fortune.

40:51.574 --> 40:52.814
Didn't cost them a thing.

40:53.868 --> 40:57.031
I created a fake tenant. I've
been paying rent ever since.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.581
In case they came back.

41:02.251 --> 41:04.458
I know it sounds crazy...
It's not crazy.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.789
You know, I'm glad that Louis
interrupted us the other morning.

41:09.342 --> 41:11.253
(CHUCKLES) You are?
Yeah.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.632
Gave me time to realize
I have more to tell you.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.133
Like, about this apartment?

41:19.894 --> 41:23.057
It used to remind me
of all the things I've lost.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.100
But now,

41:25.191 --> 41:27.148
it reminds me
of all the things

41:28.861 --> 41:30.101
you've helped me accept.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.645
What do you mean?

41:31.739 --> 41:33.650
I mean, a week ago
I never would have come over

41:33.741 --> 41:35.402
knowing that you were
still with Thomas.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.655
But that night,
I didn't even think about it,

41:37.745 --> 41:40.362
because once it hit me
that we should be together,

41:41.374 --> 41:43.115
it felt like we've always
been together.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.496
Uh-oh. You're gonna
make me cry.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.247
I'm just getting started.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.259
I thought I was gonna lose
everything at that hearing,

41:55.138 --> 41:56.594
and then I didn't.

41:58.725 --> 42:00.307
But I felt empty.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.551
And then I won,

42:04.981 --> 42:06.312
and you weren't there.

42:06.941 --> 42:10.434
What I'm trying to say is, that
night, everything finally made sense.

42:11.070 --> 42:13.562
I'm finally where
I'm supposed to be.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.147
(WHISPERING)
We both are.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.527
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

42:21.581 --> 42:22.616
What?

42:24.667 --> 42:26.783
Guess whose name
I put on the fake lease?

42:27.503 --> 42:28.664
Rick Sorkin.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.666
Oh, my God, that's the kid
who didn't show up

42:30.757 --> 42:32.964
for his interview the day
you hired Mike.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.418
See? That's what
I love about you.

42:35.511 --> 42:36.592
You get me.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.090
"Love about me"?

42:39.807 --> 42:41.013
Love about you.

43:03.206 --> 43:04.196
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

43:06.793 --> 43:08.124
Louis Litt?
Yeah.

43:08.211 --> 43:09.793
My name is Faye Richardson.

43:09.879 --> 43:12.291
I'm here on behalf of
the New York Bar Association.

43:12.381 --> 43:13.712
Here to do what?

43:13.800 --> 43:17.043
This is a court order granting
me full control of your law firm

43:17.136 --> 43:19.298
under the Bar's
special master provision.

43:24.727 --> 43:25.762
No.

43:27.647 --> 43:28.808
You can't do this.

43:28.898 --> 43:30.138
You're correct.
You do have a choice.

43:30.233 --> 43:32.440
You can refuse,
in which case tomorrow morning

43:32.527 --> 43:34.894
the Bar will suspend
every partner in this firm

43:34.987 --> 43:37.149
from practicing law
for six months.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.823
You do that, you might as well
take us apart brick by brick.

43:39.909 --> 43:42.492
Be that as it may, the only
way to avoid that outcome

43:42.578 --> 43:45.411
is for you to sign
that document right now.
