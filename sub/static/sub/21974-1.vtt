28:29.750 --> 28:30.834
Thank you for--

28:30.918 --> 28:33.754
Thank you-- just before we even, like,
keep going-- for this opportunity.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.172
Like, I...

28:35.839 --> 28:39.968
Hamish, you know.
This is just a dream come true.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.094
I...

28:42.012 --> 28:45.557
want to do the opposite of what
everyone thinks that I'm going to do.

28:45.641 --> 28:49.061
Everybody thinks that I'm going
to come out there on a fucking throne...

28:49.144 --> 28:51.813
-In a meat dress.
-In a meat dress...

28:51.897 --> 28:55.692
with 90 shirtless men, and unicorns,

28:55.776 --> 28:57.402
-and they think that that's--
-[laughing]

28:57.486 --> 28:59.029
Right? Am I right?

28:59.112 --> 29:00.072
-Yeah.
-Okay.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.617
And then, at the end, I'm going
to do something shocking, right?

29:03.700 --> 29:05.410
That's going to freak everybody out.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.206
It's not even in the neighborhood
of what we're going to do.

29:13.168 --> 29:18.840
I'd love to know how you feel
about fashion and what it means to you.

29:18.924 --> 29:24.429
Well, this album in particular, I want
everything to come out of that studio.

29:24.513 --> 29:28.433
And that girl. Because when we stay
with her, she's the gold.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.602
Yeah, well, that's--
And I think that's the--

29:30.686 --> 29:33.313
That's what people will trust as well.

29:33.397 --> 29:36.650
Honestly, we've just seen me
fucking glamorous for almost ten years.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.277
-Yeah.
-It's like, it's boring.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.070
It really is boring.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.239
We understand you. Without--

29:42.322 --> 29:45.284
And it's difficult if we haven't actually
had those conversations with you,

29:45.367 --> 29:48.287
like 'cause we're double guessing
everything. But I think that--

29:48.370 --> 29:49.913
[Lady Gaga]
Don't worry about it. I don't--

29:49.997 --> 29:54.126
Like really, it was such a good--
Sorry. I just-- It feels better.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.505
I don't want you to feel bad about it.

29:58.588 --> 30:02.217
Really, the truth of the matter is,
I just want to have a uniform.

30:02.301 --> 30:05.887
And I think my uniform should be
a black t-shirt, and black jeans,

30:05.971 --> 30:08.056
and black boots,

30:08.140 --> 30:12.477
and I just wear that a lot,
and we get versions of that made.

30:12.561 --> 30:13.562
You know what I mean?

30:13.645 --> 30:16.690
You've gone from the meat dress
and you've turned it up even more.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.985
You know, you've gone-- That next album
was even turned up even more.

30:20.068 --> 30:25.073
And I think to strip back to black
is just a go

30:25.157 --> 30:26.658
with exactly what you just said.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.119
Like that uniform, I just think is gold.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.472
[Bobby] <i> So his name is Darryl,</i>

30:48.555 --> 30:50.640
<i>T</i> magazine to go
with the Collier photos.

30:50.724 --> 30:53.769
It comes out two days after the album
in the <i> Times.</i>

30:55.062 --> 30:55.896
All right.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.857
The vibe of this,
just the mindset going in,

30:58.940 --> 31:01.318
I know this going to be you
having to go to another place.

31:01.401 --> 31:06.198
It's not necessarily where we are with it.
This is fun, confident, you know,

31:06.281 --> 31:08.742
how much you love music,
how hard you work.

31:08.825 --> 31:12.412
This guy, like, is a super high-intellect,
but also loves, like,<i> As the World Turns,</i>

31:12.496 --> 31:13.789
so it's like super high-low.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.749
So when do I play the song?

31:15.832 --> 31:17.584
-In the beginning?
-Yeah. Yeah.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.504
-Can I play another song, too, for him?
-Yeah, play three songs.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.298
Okay. That will help me get in a--

31:23.382 --> 31:24.591
[cell phone ringing]

31:25.133 --> 31:26.259
Hey, Son.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.056
Are you okay?

31:35.268 --> 31:38.105
Okay. Are you at the hospital?

31:39.898 --> 31:40.899
Okay.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.568
Um, I don't know what time we land,

31:43.652 --> 31:47.280
but I'm going to look at it
and try to come straight to you.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.120
Okay.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.914
Um... And...

31:57.290 --> 32:01.044
And they-- Your brain scan came back
that the cancer is not--

32:01.128 --> 32:02.838
didn't grow in your brain, right?

32:04.005 --> 32:04.923
That's good.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.843
But it's not smaller?

32:11.513 --> 32:13.598
Okay, go rest.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.225
-We are here.
-[Sonja] <i> Okay.</i>

32:15.308 --> 32:17.811
We'll be there soon, okay?
I love you. I'm sorry.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.313
<i>-Okay. I love you, too.</i>
-Okay.

32:20.814 --> 32:22.482
<i>All right. Okay, bye.</i>

32:24.776 --> 32:29.156
It's just... I just...
I just feel like I'm losing everybody.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.078
Okay.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.291
-Darryl?
-Yes.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.459

32:40.834 --> 32:45.589
<i>♪ Girl, where do you think you're going? ♪</i>

32:45.672 --> 32:50.969
<i>♪ Where do you think</i>

32:58.018 --> 32:59.603
[Lady Gaga] <i> So my album is called</i> Joanne.

32:59.686 --> 33:00.979
-[Darryl] Joanne?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

33:01.062 --> 33:02.564
-Do you mind starting with--
-Sure.

33:02.647 --> 33:07.777
It was my father's sister,
and she died when she was 19.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.363
She went to the hospital
with my grandmother.

33:10.447 --> 33:12.616
She was in there,
and there was something growing--

33:12.699 --> 33:13.700
There was--

33:13.783 --> 33:17.454
She had lesions,
or something was growing on her hands.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.040
And the doctors in the '70s,
they didn't know what lupus was.

33:20.123 --> 33:23.668
They didn't know how to treat it.
It's not curable, anyway. Even now.

33:24.794 --> 33:28.298
So they suggested

33:28.381 --> 33:32.010
that they immediately amputate her hands.

33:33.220 --> 33:37.474
And seeing what that did to him
and to my family...

33:38.183 --> 33:41.102
was the most powerful thing
I experienced growing up.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.065
My family is
the most important thing in my life.

33:45.148 --> 33:45.982
Yeah.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.527
Joanne was an artist.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.154
But what happened was that she...

33:51.238 --> 33:54.449
My grandmother couldn't take
her hands from her.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.953
So she just said, "Just please
let my daughter-- just let her go."

33:58.036 --> 34:02.457
And she told me she went
into the waiting room

34:02.541 --> 34:04.918
and she prayed to God that he take her.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.295
Because she said,
"I don't want my daughter to remember

34:08.380 --> 34:11.174
her last moments in life
without her hands."

34:13.842 --> 34:17.264
So, you know, I am Joanne.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.559
I am my father's daughter.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.018
And so, that's what this record is about.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.482
-That's very beautiful.
-Thank you. Thanks for listening.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.150
-No, thank you for playing it.
-Thank you.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.652
It's a gift to your father.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.610
Yeah.

34:32.070 --> 34:32.987
Yeah.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.702
Yeah, this is it.
She's got this thing on her door.

34:39.369 --> 34:41.788
-[Joe] She always leaves her door open.
-[Lady Gaga] It's Ed McMahon.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.873
-Ed McMahon?
-[Grandma] It's Ed McMahon?

34:43.956 --> 34:46.083
Hi, Grandma!

34:46.167 --> 34:47.418
Hello there.

34:47.502 --> 34:48.587
Hi.

34:49.713 --> 34:50.839
Oh, doll.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.382
-I missed you.
-You are such a precious angel.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.509
You are.

34:55.467 --> 34:57.137
-So?
-I missed you.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.265
-What a comfy place. Joe is right there.
-You like it?

35:02.017 --> 35:03.810
That's the same photo
that's in the restaurant.

35:03.893 --> 35:06.521
My father. That's Joanne.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.148
[Joe] You believe that's me?

35:08.231 --> 35:10.483
-Boy, I was a good-looking kid.
-[Grandma] Where were you?

35:10.567 --> 35:13.570
[Lady Gaga] Do you want something
to drink? Should I make you some coffee?

35:13.653 --> 35:14.821
[Joe] I could have a cup.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.364
[Grandma] All right.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.783
-This is what I wanted you to order.
-[Lady Gaga] Is this a peach?

35:18.867 --> 35:20.243
-Can I have a peach, Grandma?
-Of course.

35:20.327 --> 35:23.455
You can have anything that you find there.

35:23.538 --> 35:24.956
It's like a vacuum.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.000
[laughs]

35:27.083 --> 35:30.045
Why you got
this sexy picture of me over here?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.212
[Grandma laughs]

35:31.296 --> 35:32.464
Stefani.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.342
It's my headshots when I was...

35:35.425 --> 35:36.593
[Grandma] They're headshots.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.511
I think I was 15.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.472
I was a serious actress.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.641
Here. This proves that she had braces.

35:42.724 --> 35:46.645
Hey, if I had kept that gap, then I would
have even more problems with Madonna.

35:46.728 --> 35:47.562
[Joe] Oh, that's true.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.398
Oh, these are beautiful.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.777
There is an album here
with something that she wrote.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.070
That's one of her...

35:56.321 --> 35:58.823
This is Joanne's handwriting, right?

35:58.907 --> 36:02.035
"Hear what I'm not saying.
Don't be fooled.

36:02.118 --> 36:04.746
I wear a mask. A thousand masks.

36:05.455 --> 36:10.085
So I play the game. The glittering
but empty parade of the masks."

36:10.168 --> 36:11.836
What is that?

36:11.920 --> 36:13.880
A poem she wrote.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.924
[Joe] How come I never saw this album?

36:16.007 --> 36:18.093
[Grandma] I was always afraid
you were going to raid it.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.761
[chuckles]

36:19.844 --> 36:21.513
Grandma, this is awesome!

36:21.971 --> 36:24.099
Whatever you want, honey, take.

36:25.225 --> 36:29.729
"Directions for making things.
By Joanne Germanotta."

36:31.147 --> 36:31.981
Oh, look at that.

36:32.065 --> 36:36.111
"Joseph Germanotta
was lent one superball."

36:36.194 --> 36:39.364
[Grandma laughs]
She used to make him sign that he bo--

36:39.447 --> 36:40.740
borrowed something.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.451
[laughing]

36:43.535 --> 36:46.996
She would make him stop letting--

36:47.080 --> 36:49.499
[Lady Gaga] "He may use it for one hour."

36:50.709 --> 36:53.795
She had a great sense of humor,
I tell you.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.506
She was a joy.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.301
I got her for the 19 years.

37:01.594 --> 37:02.846
[Lady Gaga] That's good.

37:03.763 --> 37:04.848
[sighs]

37:04.931 --> 37:06.808
-That's good.
-So...

37:08.101 --> 37:09.811
You want to play the song for her?

37:11.396 --> 37:12.814
You ready to hear it?

37:13.565 --> 37:14.649
I guess.

37:14.733 --> 37:18.570
It won't be as good quality
because it's just from my phone, but--

37:18.653 --> 37:19.779
It's all right.

37:22.282 --> 37:23.616
So we'll just play it,

37:23.700 --> 37:27.120
and then if you get upset, we don't
have to talk about it. We'll-- you know?

37:27.203 --> 37:28.788
It's okay. We can just...

37:30.540 --> 37:32.417
Honey, it's been a long time.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.253
I know. I just wanted to be sens--

37:35.336 --> 37:37.839
-It's been over 40 years, so...
-I know.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.216
I know. I just want to be sensitive.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.269

-And don't...

40:48.821 --> 40:51.074
she was precious,

58:50.736 --> 58:51.737
That's good.

58:52.738 --> 58:53.655
[Mark] All right. Okay.

58:54.823 --> 58:56.992
I don't want to go,

58:57.075 --> 59:00.037
but Randy, I feel pretty confident
you know what we like now,

59:00.120 --> 59:02.247
and Gaga, you can be here to...

59:03.040 --> 59:05.167
-Cool.
-All right, I got to run.

59:05.250 --> 59:07.711
I'll speak to you tomorrow,
and the next day, and everything,

59:07.794 --> 59:10.797
because we're going to be obviously
still sorting all this shit out.

59:12.841 --> 59:14.384
Sorry, I'm a girl.

59:14.468 --> 59:16.386
What are you talking about?

59:19.765 --> 59:20.724
All right.

59:23.268 --> 59:26.521
I'm sorry, I'm a neurotic Jew.
Physical affection makes me feel awkward.

59:26.605 --> 59:29.483
Okay. I know. I know it does.

59:29.566 --> 59:30.692
Just deal with it.

59:35.530 --> 59:36.615
That's awesome.

59:36.698 --> 59:38.450
Bye.

59:39.701 --> 59:41.328
-I'll walk you outside.
-Okay.

59:55.300 --> 59:58.386
I burst into tears properly
when Mark left.

59:58.470 --> 59:59.513
[Ruth] Oh, right.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.681
But now it's kind of funny though.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.477
Are you going to be able to sleep tonight?

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:30.127
And I'm going to fight like fucking hell
for them to fucking love this.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.629
-Yeah.
-Because it is lovable.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:36.091
[man] Three... two...

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:37.342
Audio.

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:39.010
[Sofi Tukker's "Matadora" playing]

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.223
Hey, Long Island. Hey, West Palm.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.642
Hey, Miami Monsters. It's Lady Gaga.

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:47.894
And you're listening to KISS 95.7.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:51.898
Hey, Monsters! I'm on my way
to Sirius Hits One now.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.818
[radio DJ] <i> She's wearing the same booty</i>
<i>shorts I wore last Saturday.</i>

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:56.403
<i>Your booty looks incredible.</i>

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.614
Hey, I'm here at Sirius XM,
and I want to say...

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:02.868
[cheering and applause]

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.080
[Lady Gaga] <i> Thank you, London. I love you.</i>

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:15.964
[speaks Japanese]

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:20.177
[buzzing]

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.014
[woman] <i> She is</i>
<i>one of the biggest stars on the planet.</i>

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:27.267
<i>Lady Gaga, officially next year's</i>
<i>Super Bowl halftime performer.</i>

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.019
Houston.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:31.605
Yes! Yes!

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.815
[cheering and applause]

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:53.293
My name is Marlene Gerais
and I'm from New Jersey.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:56.338
She doesn't know it,
but she saved my life over and over again.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:02:01.218
Whenever I'm down, I go to her music
and it picks me up again.

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:04.846
[woman] We're just going to ask you
a few questions.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:07.307
You're going to stand in the middle
here for your piece, okay?

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.851
You'll just come stand on this,
right there. How you doing today?

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:11.686
-[Lady Gaga] Hey.
-I'm good.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.399
-Hi.
-Oh, my God.

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:17.984
Surprise!

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:21.154
Oh, my God.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:24.032
How are you?

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.285
-I like your shirt.
-Oh, my God! Thank you!

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:30.163
-How's it going?
-Oh, my God. It's going--

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:33.750
My favorite song of yours
is definitely "Born This Way."

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.502
I think it's really inspiring,

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:38.546
and whenever I'm feeling down or anything,

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:43.343
I go and put that track on,
and it, you know, inspires me.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.137
-I'm so glad you love it. Thank you.
-It's one of my favorites.

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:48.181
All right. We're all-- Cut.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.599
-And then...
-Nice meeting you.

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:53.937
I know that it's just for this radio thing
that they brought you in,

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.107
but, like, it really is so sweet
that you wait outside for me.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.817
This means so much to me.

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:04.990
I'm glad we captured the moment.
I'll bring you back out.

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:06.866
-Come on.
-Bye!

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.535
Bye! Nice to meet you!

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:11.705
Don't forget her name
and give her tickets to a show.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:15.000
Thank you so much for being you
and for your music and everything,

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:18.169
and I'm so glad I met you,
and it's seriously a dream come true,

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.755
and thank you for everything.

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:24.968
She's one of the few that actually,
like, genuinely cares about her fans,

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:26.845
and that's why I love her.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.683
Sorry.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.066
[man] <i> Your audience, man.</i>
<i>They're in this for the ride.</i>

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.736
<i>You can tell,</i>
<i>because there's no other option.</i>

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.446
[Lady Gaga] <i>Well, you know, they're--</i>

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:46.948
<i>My fans are my heart and soul.</i>

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.077
<i>What happened in the last five years?</i>

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.748
<i>To everyone else, the world is yours,</i>

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:58.460
and yet, I think people, real fans,
probably knew deep down

01:03:58.543 --> 01:03:59.836
that there was something going on.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:02.047
-It make you paranoid? Did you ever--
-Yes.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.174
-Yeah.
-Paranoia, fear.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.426
-Alcohol?
-Oh, yeah.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:07.677
<i>-Alcohol.</i>
<i>-Drugs?</i>

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.012
<i>Drugs.</i>

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.430
<i>Uh... Uh... Uh...</i>

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.725
<i>-Anxiety?</i>
<i>-Anxiety, body pain.</i>

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:17.479
<i>The public announcement</i>
<i>that your marriage is breaking up</i>

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.564
<i>-and you've got to make a record.</i>
<i>-Well, engagement.</i>

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:23.109
<i>Let's not say marriage.</i>
<i>But yeah, very painful.</i>

01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:28.782
<i>It's hard enough when, you know,</i>

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:31.659
<i>love isn't working out</i>
<i>the way you want it to</i>

01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:35.747
<i>and you got to walk down the street</i>
<i>and have somebody go, "You okay?"</i>

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:39.376
<i>I had to go</i>
<i>into the deepest pain in my life.</i>

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:44.089
<i>I had to go into the part of myself</i>
<i>that you don't want to face.</i>

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.007
[man] <i> This record is like</i>

01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:48.468
<i>the biggest change</i>
<i>we've seen in Gaga history.</i>

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:51.054
-We're going to think of this new single?
-How does it feel to--

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.056
-Know we're all about to hear it?
-[man] What's your reaction?

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.225
What was going through your head?

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.310
[man 2] What is Twitter going to say?
What are the listeners going to say?

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:59.813
It's scary,
because, you know, you just don't--

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:02.357
If they don't like it,
it's like, "Well..."

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:03.983
It's my...

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.487
It's my life. You know, my life.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:12.283
I can't wait for you to hear. It's very
personal in a way I just haven't been.

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:14.244
<i>It's so personal.</i>
<i>It's a very personal title.</i>

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.329
<i>When it comes to revealing something</i>
<i>so personal about my...</i>

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:18.665
<i>I've never been that personal</i>
<i>with my fans.</i>

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:23.420
<i>I don't think that the world</i>
<i>was ready to see who I really am,</i>

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.422
<i>because I wasn't ready to be myself.</i>

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:27.882
<i>I'm saying this is me with nothing.</i>

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.601
[Lady Gaga sobbing]

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:47.193
<i>I just want to make music,</i>
<i>and make people happy,</i>

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.320
<i>and, like, go on tour, and have a family,</i>

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:53.074
<i>and, like, I just can never get it</i>
<i>all right at the same time.</i>

01:05:55.326 --> 01:06:00.248
<i>I'm always at a shoot</i>
<i>with some fucking great news</i>

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:02.041
<i>and my love life's imploded.</i>

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:11.551
<i>When I looked in that camera today</i>
<i>and I saw my eyes were dead,</i>

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:15.180
<i>why do you think</i>
<i>I was, like, so freaked out?</i>

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:18.558
<i>-Because I could see now.</i>
-[man] <i> Yeah.</i>

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:22.729
<i>I don't need to have a million wigs on</i>
<i>and all that shit to make a statement.</i>

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:25.982
<i>I know that we want to elevate everything.</i>

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:28.234
<i>I'm trying to elevate everything,</i>

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:29.194
<i>but, like...</i>

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:33.490
<i>I can't elevate it to a...</i>

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:37.243
<i>I can't elevate it to a point</i>
<i>where I become Lady Gaga again.</i>

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:41.581
<i>Yeah, because then it's like why even...</i>
<i>why did I make this record?</i>

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:51.132
<i>And then I'm like, "It's a sad day."</i>

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:53.468
<i>When it's like I'm doing the Super Bowl.</i>

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:56.387
<i>I'm like... I'm so excited to do it,</i>

01:06:56.471 --> 01:07:01.184
<i>but I can't help but realize</i>
<i>that when I sold ten million records,</i>

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:03.520
<i>I lost Matt.</i>

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:07.941
<i>I sell 30 million, I lose Luc. You know?</i>

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.569
<i>I get the movie, I lose Taylor.</i>
<i>It's like a turnover.</i>

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:18.159
<i>This is the third time</i>
<i>I've had my heart broken like this.</i>

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:29.712
<i>But like, I'm just--</i>
<i>I'm alone, Brandon, every night.</i>

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.715
<i>And all these people will leave.</i>

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.511
<i>Right? They will leave.</i>

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:37.887
<i>And then I'll be alone.</i>

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:43.434
<i>And I go from everyone touching me</i>
<i>all day and talking at me all day</i>

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:45.061
<i>to total silence.</i>

01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:15.008
[woman] <i> Bad news for Lady Gaga.</i>

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.635
<i>The entire album</i>
<i>has reportedly leaked online.</i>

01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:19.511
[man] <i> She released</i>
<i>her fifth studio album,</i> Joanne.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.849
[woman 2] <i> If you guys didn't know already,</i>
Joanne <i> actually leaked today--</i>

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.434
[woman 3] <i> One shop has already begun</i>

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:26.394
<i>selling the album early</i>
<i>leading to the leak.</i>

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:29.981
[woman 4] <i> These pop stars might want</i>
<i>to stop leaving their music laying around.</i>

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.484
[Lady Gaga] My album's
on the internet right now. I just...

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:35.361
[woman] How do they even access it?

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:39.532
Because a record store in Belgium
decided to sell the album early.

01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:53.504
If you could just bring me up to date.

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:59.135
I have this, like, real strong, uh...

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.679
-Like...
-Tension?

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:04.724
It's tension in my abdomen. It almost--

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:09.895
It just feels like my muscles are,
like, gripping all around my intestines.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.148
-And it's so inflamed.
-Yep.

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:15.234
And my hip hurts every single day.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.238
-Know your meds off the top of your head?
-Yeah.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:20.990
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:24.327
Synthroid for thyroid,
but that's not related.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.872
I'm also on Mobic-- Mobics twice a day.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:50.770
I have chased this pain down
for five years.

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:55.775
And the fury in all of this is that

01:09:55.858 --> 01:10:00.071
-I'm fucking strong and I can still be me.
-Yep.

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:03.366
And when I feel the adrenaline
in my music and my fans,

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.827
-like, I can fucking go.
-Right.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.287
-But it doesn't mean I'm not in pain.
-Right.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.624
It sounds like you've been willing
your body to perform,

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:16.129
so in order to function, you're going
to have to shut down pain and emotions

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:17.547
-in order to do your job.
-Right.

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.174
-But I didn't know I was doing that.
-Right.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:23.761
-I was on tour in 2012.
-Okay.

01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:26.889
And not feeling good, but I--
Everything hurt.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.850
-Yeah.
-Like I didn't know it was in--

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:31.811
-I didn't know. It's just everything--
-Right. Global pain.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.187
-Global pain.
-Yeah.

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:35.773
-And mental pain.
-Yeah.

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:37.984
-Yeah, and then my hip broke.
-Okay.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.610
Okay, so let's do this.

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:42.196
So phase one is let's try to get you--

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.741
get out of this intense pain
that's in your face,

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:46.659
where you feel you're running
from the tide all the time,

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:51.247
and I know there's a component of psych
that Dr. Modir is working on.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:54.709
Phase two, let's try to get the muscles
to reeducate.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:58.880
Phase three, we do the blood spinning
to try to cause regeneration.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:10:59.839
-Okay.
-Okay?

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:02.967
So, I'll be back, and then I'll talk you
through the procedure, okay?

falling all over the place around me.

"What are we doing?"

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.781

is when those things are happening,

I'm setting up my breath,

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:55.828

to set the note right for this moment

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:56.954

the cameras.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.669

because I'm like, "Wait. Where am I?"

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.337

"Oh, here's the back of the stage."

01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:13.846
Like, when I get turned around, I'm legit,
like, "I don't know where I am."

01:22:15.973 --> 01:22:18.142
This lining is not going to work,
and I just--

01:22:18.225 --> 01:22:19.059
We're changing it.

01:22:19.143 --> 01:22:23.522
Okay, but they need to change it like now,
because I have to rehearse with it and...

01:22:24.815 --> 01:22:28.569
This is making me nervous, is--
I know to other people it's like,

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:31.697
"Oh, no big deal.
It's just a lining of a jacket."

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:36.160
But for me, it's like,
the way that the fabric on my outfit

01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:38.370
reacts to this fabric,
whatever that it is,

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:41.081
is going to change the speed
in which my arm enters the sleeve.

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:42.458
It's like a whole thing.

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:46.879
So every little thing that's not done
means more work for me Friday.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:50.174

anything bigger than this.
