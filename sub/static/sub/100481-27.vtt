REFUSED TO PUT HIS NAME ON IT."

02:34.020 --> 02:35.980
AND THE LAPTOP'S CONDUIT TO

02:36.020 --> 02:36.980
THE PRESS IS RUDY GIULIANI, WHO

02:37.020 --> 02:38.980

02:39.020 --> 02:40.700
LAST YEAR AS THE TARGET OF A

02:41.000 --> 02:41.980
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE OPERATION

02:42.020 --> 02:43.980
TO FEED MISINFORMATION TO TRUMP.

02:44.020 --> 02:45.980
AND GIULIANI'S ABILITY TO SPOT

02:46.020 --> 02:46.980
FRAUDULENT INFORMATION IS,

02:47.020 --> 02:48.980
AT BEST, NOT GREAT.

02:49.020 --> 02:50.980
HE'S SO TECHNOLOGICALLY

02:51.020 --> 02:51.980
ILLITERATE, HE HAS BUTT-DIALED

MORE THAN ONCE.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.000
WERE PUBLISHED BY VARIETY

03:07.000 --> 03:07.960

NEWSPAPER.

03:11.020 --> 03:12.980
THE WOMAN TAKE HER MICROPHONE

03:13.020 --> 03:14.980
OFF AND THEN THERE IS A SCENE

03:15.020 --> 03:15.980
WHERE IT APPEARS THAT

03:16.020 --> 03:18.000
RUDY GIULIANI'S HAND GOES DOWN

03:19.000 --> 03:19.980
HIS PANT.

03:20.020 --> 03:20.980
>> John: YOU KNOW, IT SAYS

03:21.020 --> 03:22.980
SOMETHING ABOUT RUDY'S CHARACTER

03:23.020 --> 03:23.980
THAT THE WEIRDEST PART OF

THE SENTENCE "RUDY GIULIANI GOT

03:26.020 --> 03:26.980
TRICKED, THEN SHOVED HIS HAND

03:28.020 --> 03:29.980
IN FRONT OF A RELATIVE STRANGER"

03:30.020 --> 03:30.980
IS THAT IT DOESN'T END

03:31.020 --> 03:31.980
AT THE WORD "RELATIVE."

03:32.020 --> 03:33.980
BUT THE POINT IS, ANY

03:34.020 --> 03:36.000
INFORMATION THAT GIULIANI'S

03:36.000 --> 03:36.020
NO

03:36.020 --> 03:37.700
PASSING ON SHOULD BE TREATED

03:38.000 --> 03:38.980
WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

03:39.020 --> 03:39.980
AND ALL OF THIS FUNCTIONED

03:40.020 --> 03:40.980
AS A LEAD UP TO THURSDAY'S FINAL

03:41.020 --> 03:42.220
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.

03:43.000 --> 03:43.980
SOMETHING EVERYONE WAS DREADING,

03:44.020 --> 03:44.980
AFTER THE FIASCO OF THE FIRST

03:45.020 --> 03:48.980
ONE JUST THREE WEEKS AGO.

03:49.020 --> 03:49.980
AND PERHAPS THAT IS WHY THE

03:50.020 --> 03:50.980
INITIAL REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S

03:51.020 --> 03:51.980
DEBATE WAS ONE OF SLIGHT RELIEF.

03:52.020 --> 03:54.980
>> THIS WAS AN ACTUAL DEBATE,

03:55.020 --> 03:55.980
I MEAN, AS OPPOSED TO SOME OF

03:56.020 --> 03:56.980
THE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE HAD.

03:57.020 --> 03:57.980
THERE WAS A REAL EXCHANGE.

03:58.020 --> 03:58.980
>> A SPIRITED BUT CIVIL DEBATE

03:59.020 --> 03:59.980
LAST NIGHT.

04:00.020 --> 04:00.980
>> FINALLY, A DEBATE.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.980
IT WAS SUBSTANTIVE AND

04:03.020 --> 04:03.980
INFORMATIVE.

04:04.020 --> 04:04.980
>> NO ONE SET THEMSELVES

04:05.020 --> 04:05.980
ON FIRE IN THE LAST

04:06.020 --> 04:08.980
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.

04:09.020 --> 04:10.220
>> John: YEAH, TRUE.

04:11.000 --> 04:11.960
ALTHOUGH HISTORICALLY, THE BAR

04:12.000 --> 04:12.980
FOR SUCCEEDING AT THESE EVENTS

04:13.020 --> 04:13.980
HAS BEEN A LITTLE HIGHER THAN

04:14.020 --> 04:14.980
"NOBODY BURNS ALIVE."

04:15.020 --> 04:15.980
THIS IS A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE,

04:16.019 --> 04:17.980
NOT A BEGINNER'S FIRE JUGGLING

04:18.019 --> 04:19.980
CLASS AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

04:20.019 --> 04:21.980
AND FOR ANY OTHER CANDIDATE,

04:22.019 --> 04:24.000
THINGS TRUMP SAID ON THAT DEBATE

04:24.000 --> 04:24.020
NO

04:24.020 --> 04:24.980
STAGE WOULD'VE BEEN AN ACT OF

04:25.020 --> 04:25.980
SELF-IMMOLATION.

04:26.020 --> 04:30.000
HE INSISTED WE'RE ROUNDING

04:30.000 --> 04:30.020
NO

04:30.020 --> 04:31.980
THE TURN ON THE CORONAVIRUS,

04:32.020 --> 04:32.980
WHICH WE VERY MUCH ARE NOT.

04:33.020 --> 04:33.980
HE CLAIMED THAT WIND TURBINES

04:34.020 --> 04:34.980
"KILL ALL THE BIRDS,"

04:35.020 --> 04:35.980
WHICH THEY DON'T.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.880
AND ARGUED THAT BIDEN'S CLIMATE

04:38.000 --> 04:38.020
POLICY SUGGESTS, "IF BUILDINGS

04:38.020 --> 04:38.980
HAD NO WINDOWS, IT WOULD BE

04:39.020 --> 04:41.980
A LOVELY THING," WHICH IS JUST

04:42.020 --> 04:42.980
A VERY WEIRD THING TO SAY.

04:43.020 --> 04:43.980
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS.

04:44.020 --> 04:46.980
>> I AM THE LEAST RACIST PERSON

04:47.020 --> 04:50.000
-- I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE AUDIENCE

04:50.000 --> 04:50.000
NO

04:50.000 --> 04:50.020
BECAUSE IT'S SO DARK -- BUT I

04:50.020 --> 04:51.980
DON'T CARE WHO'S IN THE AUDIENCE

04:52.020 --> 04:52.980
-- I'M THE LEAST RACIST PERSON

04:53.020 --> 04:56.980
IN THIS ROOM.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.000
>> John: RIGHT.

04:58.000 --> 04:58.960
THAT IS STRANGE FOR

04:59.000 --> 04:59.020
MULTIPLE REASONS.

04:59.020 --> 05:01.000
FIRST, HE'S IMPLYING HIS ANSWER

05:01.000 --> 05:01.020
MIGHT HAVE CHANGED IF THE HOUSE

05:01.020 --> 05:01.980
LIGHTS WERE UP.

05:02.020 --> 05:02.980
"I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE AUDIENCE,

05:03.020 --> 05:07.000
BUT I'M THE LEAST RACIST PERSON

05:07.000 --> 05:07.020

05:07.020 --> 05:08.980
TOM HANKS?

05:09.020 --> 05:11.000
OH, SHIT, HE'S DEFINITELY LESS

05:11.000 --> 05:11.020
RACIST THAN ME, FOR SURE.

05:11.020 --> 05:11.980
BUT I THINK I'M STILL IN

05:12.020 --> 05:12.980
THE TOP TWO."

05:13.020 --> 05:13.980
ALSO, IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

05:14.020 --> 05:14.980
WHEN HE SAID HE'S THE LEAST

05:15.020 --> 05:16.000
RACIST PERSON IN THE ROOM, THAT

05:16.000 --> 05:16.020
ROOM CONTAINED -- AND THIS IS

05:16.020 --> 05:19.980
TRUE -- HIS FAMILY.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.980
SO HE'S EFFECTIVELY THROWING

05:23.020 --> 05:24.980
THEM UNDER THE BUS THERE, TOO.

05:25.020 --> 05:25.980
LOOK, WHAT IS REALLY SAD HERE IS

05:26.020 --> 05:26.980
THAT WHEN PEOPLE CLAIM TRUMP WAS

05:27.020 --> 05:27.980
ON HIS "BEST BEHAVIOR" -- THAT'S

05:28.020 --> 05:28.980
ACTUALLY TRUE.

05:29.020 --> 05:29.980
BUT HIS BEST BEHAVIOR IS STILL

05:30.020 --> 05:31.980
ABSOLUTELY APPALLING.

05:32.020 --> 05:32.980
BECAUSE EVEN WHEN THE BAR IS

06:29.000 --> 06:29.980
POSITIVE ABOUT G.E. BECAUSE I AM

06:30.020 --> 06:32.980
A KIND MAN AND I'M A GOOD MAN,

06:33.020 --> 06:33.980
NOT UNLIKE "APOCALYPSE NOW."

06:34.020 --> 06:35.980
I AM A KIND MAN, I'M A GOOD MAN.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.980
THAT IS FROM "APOCALYPSE NOW."

06:38.020 --> 06:39.940
I AM A KIND MAN, I'M A GOOD MAN,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.980
SAID TO ME BY THE WAY, AND

06:42.020 --> 06:42.980
"APOCALYPSE NOW" AT THE END.

06:43.020 --> 06:45.980
>> I'M A KIND MAN.

06:46.020 --> 06:46.980
JUST LIKE IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE

06:47.020 --> 06:49.980
"APOCALYPSE NOW," I WILL COIN

06:50.020 --> 06:50.980
THIS, SELL EVERYTHING, SO THE

06:51.020 --> 06:52.980
KIDS, SELL THE CAR, SELL THE

06:53.020 --> 06:55.000
HOME, I'M NOT COMING BACK,

06:56.000 --> 06:56.020
"APOCALYPSE NOW."

06:56.020 --> 06:57.980
>> KIND OF LIKE THE VILLAGE

06:58.020 --> 07:00.000
BURNING WITH NAPALM AND

07:00.000 --> 07:00.020
"APOCALYPSE NOW."

07:00.020 --> 07:02.000
>> "APOCALYPSE NOW" SITUATION.

07:02.000 --> 07:02.020
>> "APOCALYPSE NOW."

07:02.020 --> 07:05.000
>> HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

07:05.000 --> 07:05.020
"APOCALYPSE NOW"?

07:05.020 --> 07:08.000
>> HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

07:08.000 --> 07:08.020
"APOCALYPSE NOW"?

07:08.020 --> 07:10.000
>> MANY TIMES.

07:11.000 --> 07:11.020
>> John: MOVING ON.

07:11.020 --> 07:11.980
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:12.020 --> 07:12.980
IMMIGRATION.

07:13.020 --> 07:13.980
IT'S ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL TO THE

07:14.020 --> 07:14.980
AMERICAN STORY, AS IS SOMETIMES

07:15.020 --> 07:15.980
CLUMSILY EXPRESSED IN CARTOONS

07:16.020 --> 07:16.980
LIKE THIS.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.980
>> THEY HEARD ABOUT A COUNTRY

07:19.020 --> 07:21.980
WHERE LIFE MIGHT LET THEM WIN,

07:22.020 --> 07:23.980
THEY PAID THE FARE TO AMERICA

07:24.020 --> 07:27.980
AND THERE THEY MELTED IN.

07:28.020 --> 07:30.980
LOVELY LADY LIBERTY WITH HER

07:31.020 --> 07:34.980
BOOK OF RECIPES AND THE FINEST

07:35.020 --> 07:37.980
ONE SHE'S GOT IS THE GREAT

07:38.020 --> 07:40.980
AMERICAN MELTING POT.

07:41.020 --> 07:45.980
THE GREAT AMERICAN MELTING POT.

07:46.020 --> 07:48.000
>> John: OKAY, DEEPLY WEIRD

07:49.000 --> 07:50.980
METAPHOR ASIDE, I WILL SAY THIS:

07:51.020 --> 07:51.980
IF YOU'RE COOKING A BUNCH OF

07:52.020 --> 07:52.980
HUMANS IN A MELTING POT,

07:53.020 --> 07:55.980
DON'T INCLUDE THE ENGLISH.

07:56.020 --> 07:57.940
BELIEVE ME, WE'LL RUIN THE DISH.

07:58.000 --> 07:58.980
WE'RE BLAND AND YET ALSO TOTALLY

07:59.020 --> 08:02.980
OVERPOWERING TO THE PALATE.

08:03.020 --> 08:03.980
WE ARE BASICALLY THE CILANTRO OF

08:04.020 --> 08:04.980
THE HUMAN RACE.

08:05.020 --> 08:05.980
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IMMIGRATION

08:06.020 --> 08:06.980
REPEATEDLY ON THIS SHOW BUT

08:07.020 --> 08:07.980
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

08:08.020 --> 08:09.000
JUST ONE NARROW AREA OF IT:

08:09.000 --> 08:09.500
ASYLUM.

08:10.000 --> 08:10.980
IT'S THE LEGAL PROCESS BY WHICH

08:11.020 --> 08:11.980
PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING

08:12.020 --> 08:12.980
PERSECUTION, AND MAKE IT TO

08:13.020 --> 08:15.000
THE U.S., CAN APPLY TO STAY

08:15.000 --> 08:15.020
HERE.

08:15.020 --> 08:15.980
AND ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE A GROUP

08:16.020 --> 08:16.980
THAT, IN THEORY, EVERYONE SHOULD

08:17.020 --> 08:18.980
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT -- THEY ARE

08:19.020 --> 08:19.980
THE LITERAL HUDDLED MASSES

08:20.020 --> 08:20.980
YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE WHO

08:21.020 --> 08:21.980
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY HAS,

08:22.020 --> 08:23.980
FOR CENTURIES, FRICASSEED.

08:24.020 --> 08:25.980
BUT TRUMP IS FAMOUSLY NOT A FAN.

08:26.020 --> 08:27.980
HE WENT ON ABOUT ASYLUM

08:28.020 --> 08:30.980
AT LENGTH IN THURSDAY'S DEBATE,

08:31.020 --> 08:32.000
AND HE LOVES TO RIFF ABOUT IT

08:32.000 --> 08:32.960
WHENEVER HE GETS IN FRONT

08:33.000 --> 08:35.980
OF A CROWD.

08:36.020 --> 08:38.980
>> THE ASYLUM PROGRAM IS A SCAM.

08:39.020 --> 08:40.980
SOME OF THE ROUGHEST PEOPLE

08:41.020 --> 08:42.980
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.580
PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THEY

08:45.000 --> 08:46.980
SHOULD BE FIGHTING FOR THE UFC.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.980
THEY READ A LITTLE PAGE GIVEN

08:49.020 --> 08:50.980
BY LAWYERS.

08:51.020 --> 08:55.980
I AM VERY FEARFUL FOR MY LIFE.

08:56.020 --> 08:58.980
I AM VERY WORRIED THAT I WILL BE

08:59.020 --> 09:01.000
ACCOSTED IF I WAS SENT BACK

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
HOME.

09:03.000 --> 09:03.960
OH, GIVE HIM ASYLUM.

09:04.000 --> 09:04.980
HE'S AFRAID.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.980
HE'S AFRAID.

09:08.020 --> 09:08.980
WE DON'T LOVE THE FACT HE'S GOT

09:09.020 --> 09:11.980
TATTOOS ON HIS FACE.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.880
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT TO

09:14.000 --> 09:14.020
UNPACK THERE, STARTING WITH

09:14.020 --> 09:14.980
THE FACT THAT TRUMP SEEMS TO

09:15.020 --> 09:16.980
THINK PEOPLE WITH FACIAL TATTOOS

09:17.020 --> 09:18.980
ARE JUST INHERENTLY SCARY,

09:19.020 --> 09:19.980
SOMETHING DEFINITIVELY DISPROVEN

09:20.020 --> 09:21.980
BY THE EXISTENCE OF POST MALONE.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.980
HE LOOKS LIKE A BUILD-A-BEAR

09:24.020 --> 09:24.980
WHO SPENT TOO MUCH TIME AT

09:25.020 --> 09:25.980
THE TATTOO STATION.

09:26.020 --> 09:27.980
ALSO, AS YOU PROBABLY GUESSED,

09:28.020 --> 09:29.980
THE ASYLUM PROCESS ISN'T

09:30.020 --> 09:30.980
A SIMPLE RECITATION OF MAGIC

09:31.020 --> 09:33.000
WORDS, BY WHICH ALL MANNER OF

09:33.000 --> 09:33.020
FRAUDULENT CLAIMS ARE LET

09:33.020 --> 09:34.980
THROUGH.

09:35.020 --> 09:35.980
NOR IS IT RESPONSIBLE FOR, AS

09:36.020 --> 09:37.700
TRUMP'S OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE

09:38.000 --> 09:38.980
WEBSITE CALLS IT, "THE BIGGEST

09:39.020 --> 09:39.980
LOOPHOLE TO GAIN ENTRY INTO OUR

09:40.020 --> 09:43.980
GREAT COUNTRY."

09:44.020 --> 09:44.980
THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

09:45.020 --> 09:46.980
HISTORICALLY, THE BIGGEST

09:47.020 --> 09:47.980
LOOPHOLE HAS BEEN TO BE

09:48.020 --> 09:48.980
THE PARENTS OF SOMEONE

09:49.020 --> 09:49.980
THAT DONALD TRUMP WISHES WOULD

09:50.020 --> 09:51.000
FUCK HIM.

09:52.000 --> 09:52.980
AND FOR THE RECORD, ASYLUM

09:53.020 --> 09:53.980
SEEKERS ARE NOT ALL TATTOOED

09:54.020 --> 09:54.980
UFC FIGHTERS.

09:55.020 --> 09:56.980
THEY'RE ALSO PEOPLE LIKE BERTA,

09:57.020 --> 09:58.980
WHO FLED HONDURAS AFTER MS-13

09:59.020 --> 10:02.000
GANG MEMBERS TRIED TO FORCE HER

10:02.000 --> 10:02.020
12-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER INTO

10:02.020 --> 10:03.980
MARRIAGE.

10:04.020 --> 10:04.980
BERTA REFUSED, THEY THREATENED

10:05.020 --> 10:06.980
TO SET HER ON FIRE, SO SHE AND

10:07.020 --> 10:08.000
HER GRANDDAUGHTER FLED TO

10:08.000 --> 10:08.020
THE U.S.

10:08.020 --> 10:09.220
THEY WERE SEPARATED,

10:10.000 --> 10:10.980
BERTA WAS DETAINED,

10:11.020 --> 10:11.980
AND I'LL LET HER LAWYER PICK

10:12.020 --> 10:13.980
THE STORY UP FROM THERE.

10:14.020 --> 10:15.980
>> BERTA, MY CLIENT, SHE'S

10:16.020 --> 10:17.520
A 63-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER

10:18.000 --> 10:18.980
WHO LEGALLY ENTERED

10:19.020 --> 10:19.980
THE UNITED STATES.

10:20.020 --> 10:20.980
AND SHE'S FLEEING FOR HER LIFE,

10:21.020 --> 10:22.000
BUT SHE DID IT THE CORRECT WAY.

10:22.000 --> 10:22.020
WHY?

10:22.020 --> 10:22.980
'CAUSE SHE WENT TO THE PORT OF

10:23.020 --> 10:24.980
ENTRY AND BASICALLY TURNED

10:25.020 --> 10:25.980
HERSELF IN.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.980
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE WAS HIDING,

10:28.020 --> 10:28.980
SHE WAS TRYING TO BE SMUGGLED

10:29.020 --> 10:29.980
IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.980
SHE DID IT THE RIGHT WAY.

10:32.020 --> 10:34.980
>> I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 17 MONTHS.

10:35.020 --> 10:35.980
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME

10:36.020 --> 10:39.980
ALREADY.

10:40.020 --> 10:40.980
I DON'T KNOW WHY IMMIGRATION

10:41.020 --> 10:42.980
WON'T LET ME LEAVE.

10:43.020 --> 10:43.980
I DON'T OWE ANYTHING.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.980
ONLY BECAUSE I CAME TO ASK FOR

10:46.020 --> 10:51.980
PROTECTION FROM THIS COUNTRY.

10:52.020 --> 10:52.980
>> John: THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.000
IF YOU ASKED THE COPS FOR HELP,

10:54.000 --> 10:54.020
AND THEY RESPONDED BY THROWING

10:54.020 --> 10:54.980
YOU INTO DETENTION, YOU'D BE

10:55.020 --> 10:56.980
ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.760
YOU'D PROBABLY ALSO BE BLACK,

10:59.000 --> 10:59.960
BUT LET'S TRY AND TAKE THIS

11:00.000 --> 11:00.980
ONE SYSTEMIC SOCIAL CRISIS

11:01.020 --> 11:01.980
AT A TIME.

11:02.020 --> 11:02.980
AND BERTA'S STORY ISN'T EVEN

11:03.020 --> 11:03.980
A ONE-OFF.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.980
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

11:06.020 --> 11:06.980
ATTACK ON ASYLUM HAS BEEN

11:07.020 --> 11:07.980
FOCUSED, DEDICATED, AND

11:08.020 --> 11:09.980
DEEPLY RESOURCEFUL.

11:10.020 --> 11:10.980
AND I KNOW THOSE AREN'T

11:11.020 --> 11:11.980
ADJECTIVES YOU'RE USED

11:12.020 --> 11:12.980
TO ASSOCIATING WITH THIS

11:13.020 --> 11:14.980
ADMINISTRATION.

11:15.020 --> 11:15.980
BUT IN THIS ONE AREA, THEY'VE

11:16.020 --> 11:17.700
BEEN TRULY DISCIPLINED ABOUT

11:18.000 --> 11:18.980
BEING TRULY EVIL.

11:19.020 --> 11:19.980
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR

11:20.020 --> 11:21.980
ASYLUM SYSTEM.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.980
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK, AND

11:24.020 --> 11:25.980
JUST A FEW OF THE KEY WAYS THIS

11:26.020 --> 11:26.980
ADMINISTRATION HAS UNDERMINED

11:27.020 --> 11:27.980
IT.

11:28.020 --> 11:28.980
AND LET'S START WITH HOW IT'S

11:29.020 --> 11:30.980
SUPPOSED TO WORK AT OUR BORDER.

11:31.020 --> 11:31.980
IDEALLY, AN ASYLUM SEEKER

11:32.020 --> 11:33.980
PRESENTS THEMSELVES TO ASK

11:34.020 --> 11:35.980
FOR PROTECTION, AND AN OFFICER

11:36.020 --> 11:36.980
PERFORMS A "CREDIBLE FEAR

11:37.020 --> 11:39.980
SCREENING."

11:40.020 --> 11:41.000
IF THERE IS A CHANCE THEY MIGHT

11:41.000 --> 11:41.020
FACE DANGER IF THEY'RE SENT BACK

11:41.020 --> 11:43.000
HOME, THEY'RE ALLOWED TO REMAIN

11:43.000 --> 11:43.020
IN THE U.S. PENDING A DATE IN

11:43.020 --> 11:43.980
IMMIGRATION COURT.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.980
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

11:46.020 --> 11:47.980
WHEN A PERSON SAYS THEIR LIFE'S

11:48.020 --> 11:49.980
AT STAKE, YOU WANT TO ERR ON

11:50.020 --> 11:51.000
THE SIDE OF BELIEVING THEM

11:51.000 --> 11:51.960
WHILE YOU WEIGH THE FACTS OF

11:52.000 --> 11:52.980
THEIR CASE.

11:53.020 --> 11:54.980
IF SOMEONE SAYS "I'M DROWNING,"

11:55.020 --> 11:55.980
YOUR FIRST MOVE SHOULD BE TO

11:56.020 --> 11:56.980
HELP THEM OUT OF THE POOL, NOT

11:57.020 --> 11:59.000
LEAVE THEM IN THERE WHILE YOU

11:59.000 --> 11:59.960
CONVENE A HEARING TO DETERMINE

12:00.000 --> 12:00.020
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE A FISH

12:00.020 --> 12:01.000
WHO IS LYING.

12:02.000 --> 12:02.980
NOW YOU SHOULD KNOW, EVEN BEFORE

12:03.020 --> 12:03.980
TRUMP, THE ODDS OF BEING GRANTED

12:04.020 --> 12:05.640
ASYLUM WERE NOT GREAT, WITH

12:06.000 --> 12:06.980
IMMIGRATION ADVOCATES SAYING

12:07.020 --> 12:08.980
LESS THAN HALF OF ALL CLAIMS

12:09.020 --> 12:11.980
ARE GRANTED.

12:12.020 --> 12:12.980
NOW THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE -- AS

12:13.020 --> 12:13.980
WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE -- MANY

12:14.020 --> 12:15.980
MIGRANTS DON'T HAVE A LAWYER TO

12:16.020 --> 12:16.980
HELP THEM NAVIGATE A COMPLICATED

12:17.020 --> 12:17.980
PROCESS.

12:18.020 --> 12:18.980
AND IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THE BAR

12:19.020 --> 12:20.980
TO QUALIFY FOR ASYLUM IS HIGH.

12:21.020 --> 12:22.980
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVE

12:23.020 --> 12:23.980
YOU'RE BEING PERSECUTED ON

12:24.020 --> 12:25.980
THE BASIS OF RACE, RELIGION,

12:26.020 --> 12:28.980
NATIONALITY, MEMBERSHIP

12:29.020 --> 12:29.980
IN A SOCIAL GROUP, OR POLITICAL

12:30.020 --> 12:30.980
OPINION.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.000
AND THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO

12:32.000 --> 12:32.960
BE ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION

12:33.000 --> 12:33.500
THERE.

12:34.000 --> 12:34.020
WHAT QUALIFIES AS MEMBERSHIP IN

12:34.020 --> 12:35.980
A SOCIAL GROUP OR A POLITICAL

12:36.020 --> 12:36.980
OPINION?

12:37.020 --> 12:38.980
FOR INSTANCE, SOMEONE BEING

12:39.020 --> 12:39.980
PERSECUTED FOR CRITICIZING

12:40.020 --> 12:40.980
A DRUG CARTEL MIGHT WELL ARGUE

12:41.020 --> 12:41.980
THAT THEIR CRITICISM IS

12:42.020 --> 12:43.980
POLITICAL IF THEY LIVE

12:44.020 --> 12:44.980
IN A NARCO-STATE.

12:45.020 --> 12:46.980
BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS

12:47.020 --> 12:48.980
TOLD IMMIGRATION JUDGES TO APPLY

12:49.020 --> 12:50.980
THE CRITERIA VERY NARROWLY, AS

12:51.020 --> 12:51.980
THIS ATTORNEY EXPLAINS TO A ROOM

12:52.020 --> 12:54.980
FULL OF ASYLUM SEEKERS.

12:55.020 --> 12:55.980
>> THE ASYLUM PROCESS DOES NOT

12:56.020 --> 12:58.980
PROTECT EVERYONE.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.980
CASES THAT PERTAIN TO CARTELS OR

13:01.020 --> 13:02.980
GANGS EXTORTING YOU ARE ALMOST

13:03.020 --> 13:09.980
IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN.

13:10.020 --> 13:10.980
UH-HUH?

13:11.020 --> 13:11.980
>> I HAVE A PROBLEM IN MY

13:12.020 --> 13:13.980
COUNTRY.

13:14.020 --> 13:14.980
I CAN'T GO BACK.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.980
>> THIS IS VERY COMMON.

13:17.020 --> 13:17.980
THEY ALREADY KILLED FAMILY WHO

13:18.020 --> 13:20.980
DIDN'T PAY.

13:21.020 --> 13:21.980
CRIMINALITY ISN'T PROTECTED.

13:22.020 --> 13:23.980
>> YOU'RE SAYING WE CAN ONLY

13:24.020 --> 13:27.000
PROVE IT IF WE TURN UP DEAD?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.980
>> EVEN THEN, IF IT'S NOT

13:30.020 --> 13:30.980
THE RIGHT REASON, IT'S NOT

13:31.020 --> 13:32.980
PROTECTED.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.000
>> John: WOW.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.980
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MORE JARRING

13:37.020 --> 13:37.980
THERE, THAT MAN'S PITCH-BLACK

13:38.020 --> 13:39.000
JOKE ABOUT GETTING MURDERED OR

13:39.000 --> 13:39.020
THE LAWYER TAKING IT AT COMPLETE

13:39.020 --> 13:40.980
FACE VALUE.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.980
"HA, THAT'S VERY FUNNY, BUT

13:43.020 --> 13:44.000
SERIOUSLY, IF YOU COULD DIE

13:44.000 --> 13:44.960
HOLDING DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU

13:45.000 --> 13:45.020
WERE MURDERED FOR YOUR RELIGION,

13:45.020 --> 13:45.980
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A BIG

13:46.020 --> 13:46.980
HELP."

13:47.020 --> 13:48.980
SO THE ASYLUM PROCESS HAS NEVER

13:49.020 --> 13:50.980
BEEN EASY.

13:51.020 --> 13:51.980
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE

13:52.020 --> 13:53.980
IT ABSOLUTE HELL.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.980
THEIR POLICY OF FAMILY

13:56.020 --> 13:57.980
SEPARATION CAUSED WIDESPREAD

13:58.020 --> 13:58.980
OUTRAGE, BUT THEY'VE DONE SO

13:59.020 --> 14:01.980
MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

14:02.020 --> 14:02.980
AND IT'S WORTH SLOWING DOWN TO

14:03.020 --> 14:04.980
LOOK AT THREE TACTICS THEY'VE

14:05.020 --> 14:05.980
USED IN PARTICULAR.

14:06.020 --> 14:06.980
MIGRANT PROTECTION PROTOCOLS,

14:07.020 --> 14:08.980
"SAFE THIRD COUNTRY AGREEMENTS,"

14:09.020 --> 14:09.980
AND TITLE 42.

14:10.020 --> 14:11.980
AND I KNOW NONE OF THOSE HAVE

14:12.020 --> 14:13.980
THE HARROWING RING OF

14:14.020 --> 14:14.980
"FAMILY SEPARATION," BUT EACH

14:15.020 --> 14:16.980
REPRESENTS ANOTHER CRUEL,

14:17.020 --> 14:17.980
CALCULATED DECISION THAT HAS

14:18.020 --> 14:19.980
LARGELY FLOWN UNDER THE RADAR.

14:20.020 --> 14:20.980
AND LET'S START WITH THE MIGRANT

14:21.020 --> 14:22.980
PROTECTION PROTOCOLS, OR, AS

14:23.020 --> 14:23.980
THEY'RE MORE COMMONLY KNOWN,

14:24.020 --> 14:26.000
THE "REMAIN IN MEXICO" PROGRAM.

14:27.000 --> 14:27.980
VERY BASICALLY, THIS POLICY

14:28.020 --> 14:29.980
FORCES ASYLUM SEEKERS TO WAIT IN

14:30.020 --> 14:31.980
MEXICO FOR THEIR CASES TO FULLY

14:32.020 --> 14:32.980
PLAY OUT IN U.S. IMMIGRATION

14:33.020 --> 14:34.980
COURT RATHER THAN ADMIT THEM TO

14:35.020 --> 14:35.980
SAFETY FIRST.

14:36.020 --> 14:37.980
WE'VE ALREADY DONE THIS TO OVER

14:38.020 --> 14:39.980
67,000 PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM

14:40.020 --> 14:41.980
WOUND UP IN MAKESHIFT CAMPS

14:42.020 --> 14:42.980
THAT HAVE EMERGED AT THE BORDER.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.980
AND SINCE WE STARTED LIMITING

14:46.020 --> 14:47.980
THE NUMBER EVEN ALLOWED TO ASK

14:48.020 --> 14:48.980
FOR ASYLUM AT THE BORDER EACH

14:49.020 --> 14:50.980
DAY, IN SOME PLACES, THE

14:51.020 --> 14:51.980
MIGRANTS THEMSELVES HAD TO WORK

14:52.020 --> 14:52.980
OUT A SYSTEM FOR WHOSE TURN IT

14:53.020 --> 14:54.980
WAS NEXT.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.980
>> THE LIST IS A STRANGE THING.

14:57.020 --> 14:57.980
VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE MIGRANTS

14:58.020 --> 14:59.980
THEMSELVES KEEP THEM IN A

15:00.020 --> 15:00.980
NOTEPAD IN THE MEXICAN BORDER

15:01.020 --> 15:02.000
CITY OF TIJUANA.

15:03.000 --> 15:03.960
IT DETERMINES THE ORDER IN WHICH

15:04.000 --> 15:04.980
THE THOUSANDS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS

15:05.020 --> 15:05.980
HERE WILL BE SEEN BY U.S.

15:06.020 --> 15:09.980
OFFICIALS.

15:10.020 --> 15:10.980
NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHO

15:11.020 --> 15:11.980
STARTED IT OR WHEN, BUT IT'S

15:12.020 --> 15:16.980
EVOLVED INTO A SYSTEM TO TRY AND

15:17.020 --> 15:18.980
KEEP ORDER AS THE U.S. HAS

15:19.020 --> 15:19.980
SLOWED UP THE PROCESSING OF

15:20.020 --> 15:20.980
ASYLUM CLAIMS.

15:21.020 --> 15:21.980
>> John: LOOK, THERE ARE PLENTY

15:22.020 --> 15:23.000
OF THINGS YOU'D EXPECT TO BE

15:23.000 --> 15:23.020
HAND-WRITTEN IN A COLLEGE RULED

15:23.020 --> 15:23.980
NOTEBOOK.

15:24.020 --> 15:24.980
MATH HOMEWORK, SURE.

15:25.020 --> 15:25.980
A LIST OF THE CUTEST BOYS IN

15:26.020 --> 15:26.980
HOMEROOM, NATCH.

15:27.020 --> 15:28.700
JUST AN ABSOLUTE SHITLOAD OF

15:29.000 --> 15:29.020
COOL Ss?

15:29.020 --> 15:30.980
YOU KNOW IT.

15:31.020 --> 15:31.980
WHAT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT WOULD

15:32.020 --> 15:32.980
BE THE NAMES OF THOUSANDS OF

15:33.020 --> 15:35.000
FAMILIES FOR WHOM THIS SCRAP OF

15:35.000 --> 15:35.020
NOTEBOOK PAPER IS THEIR ONLY

15:35.020 --> 15:36.980
LIFELINE TO SAFETY.

15:37.020 --> 15:37.980
BECAUSE HOW THE FUCK HAVE WE LET

15:38.020 --> 15:38.980
THAT BE THE BEST SYSTEM

15:39.020 --> 15:40.980
AVAILABLE TO THEM?

15:41.020 --> 15:41.980
AND CONDITIONS ON THE BORDER CAN

15:42.020 --> 15:43.980
BE DIRE.

15:44.020 --> 15:45.980
IN FEBRUARY, MORE THAN 2500

15:46.020 --> 15:46.980
MIGRANTS WERE LIVING IN A CAMP

15:47.020 --> 15:48.980
IN MATAMOROS, WHERE THERE WAS

15:49.020 --> 15:49.980
ONLY ONE TOILET FOR EVERY

15:50.020 --> 15:50.980
60 PEOPLE, AND SAFE DRINKING

15:51.020 --> 15:52.980
WATER WAS SCARCE.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.980
AND EVEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T WIND

15:55.020 --> 15:56.980
UP IN THOSE CAMPS CAN BE IN

15:57.020 --> 15:57.980
REAL JEOPARDY.

15:58.020 --> 16:01.980
BECAUSE MIGRANTS IN GENERAL CAN

16:02.020 --> 16:02.980
BE TARGETS FOR CARTELS WHO

16:03.020 --> 16:04.000
REGULARLY KIDNAP AND TRY TO

16:04.000 --> 16:04.960
EXTRACT RANSOM MONEY FROM THOSE

16:05.000 --> 16:05.980
THEY SUSPECT OF HAVING FAMILY IN

16:06.020 --> 16:06.980
THE U.S.

16:07.020 --> 16:08.980
THIS IS DONE SO OFTEN, THERE'S A

16:09.020 --> 16:10.980
WHOLE SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR IT, AS

16:11.020 --> 16:12.980
THIS CARTEL MEMBER EXPLAINS.

16:13.020 --> 16:14.980
>> WE JUST PULL PEOPLE OFF THE

16:15.020 --> 16:15.980
STREETS, TAKE THEM INTO A SAFE

16:16.020 --> 16:18.980
HOUSE.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.980
WE REACH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE

16:21.020 --> 16:22.980
UNITED STATES TO ASK FOR MONEY.

16:23.020 --> 16:26.980
>> HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE TALKING

16:27.020 --> 16:27.980
HERE?

16:28.020 --> 16:29.980
>> ALL THE WAY FROM $10,000 TO

16:30.020 --> 16:33.980
$20,000 AMERICAN DOLLARS.

16:34.020 --> 16:34.980
WE KNOW THEY CAN AFFORD IT.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.980
THAT'S WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO.

16:37.020 --> 16:38.980
>> WHAT IF THEY DON'T PAY?

16:39.020 --> 16:39.980
>> WELL, THEY END UP WHERE THEY

16:40.020 --> 16:40.980
END UP.

16:41.020 --> 16:41.980
>> John: "THEY END UP WHERE THEY

16:42.020 --> 16:43.980
END UP."

16:44.020 --> 16:44.980
HE'S TALKING ABOUT MURDER

16:45.020 --> 16:47.000
VICTIMS WITH THE SAME CASUALNESS

16:47.000 --> 16:47.020
MOST PEOPLE RESERVE FOR LOST

16:47.020 --> 16:48.980
SOCKS.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.980
AND AS OF MAY, THERE WERE OVER A

16:51.020 --> 16:52.940
THOUSAND PUBLICLY REPORTED CASES

16:53.000 --> 16:53.980
OF MURDER, RAPE, TORTURE,

16:54.020 --> 16:54.980
KIDNAPPING, AND OTHER VIOLENT

16:55.020 --> 16:57.980
ASSAULTS AGAINST ASYLUM SEEKERS

16:58.020 --> 16:58.980
AND MIGRANTS FORCED BY THE U.S.,

16:59.020 --> 16:59.980
COMPLETELY UNNECESSARILY, TO

17:00.020 --> 17:01.980
WAIT IN MEXICO.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.980
IN FACT, KIDNAPPINGS ARE SUCH A

17:04.020 --> 17:05.980
FACT OF LIFE, CARTELS WILL GIVE

17:06.020 --> 17:07.980
SOME KIDNAPPED MIGRANTS A CODE

17:08.020 --> 17:08.980
WORD UPON RELEASE, SO IF THEY'RE

17:09.020 --> 17:10.980
KIDNAPPED AGAIN, THE KEYWORD

17:11.020 --> 17:11.980
WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY'D

17:12.020 --> 17:13.980
ALREADY PAID THE RANSOM.

17:14.020 --> 17:15.980
AND IT'S PRETTY BLEAK WHEN

17:16.020 --> 17:17.980
DRUG CARTELS HAVE A MORE

17:18.020 --> 17:18.980
EFFICIENT SYSTEM FOR KEEPING

17:19.020 --> 17:19.980
TRACK OF ASYLUM SEEKERS THAN

17:20.020 --> 17:20.980
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.980
AND YET DESPITE THE WRECKAGE

17:23.020 --> 17:25.980
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CAUSED,

17:26.020 --> 17:26.980
IT'S TRUMPETED ITS "REMAIN IN

17:27.020 --> 17:27.980
MEXICO" PROGRAM AS A GREAT

17:28.020 --> 17:28.980
SUCCESS.

17:29.020 --> 17:29.980
IN FACT, CHAD WOLF -- ACTING

17:30.020 --> 17:31.980
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY

17:32.020 --> 17:33.980
AND UNDISPUTED CHADDIEST WOLF --

17:34.020 --> 17:34.980
HAS TOUTED IT, USING A PRETTY

17:35.020 --> 17:36.980
WEIRD METRIC.

17:37.020 --> 17:37.980
>> WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS ABOUT

17:38.020 --> 17:38.980
HALF OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT

17:39.020 --> 17:39.980
ARE PUT IN THE PROGRAM NEVER

17:40.020 --> 17:43.000
SHOW UP FOR THEIR COURT

17:43.000 --> 17:43.020
HEARINGS.

17:43.020 --> 17:43.980
SO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PUT IN

17:44.020 --> 17:45.980
THIS PROGRAM THAT KNOW THEY DO

17:46.020 --> 17:46.980
NOT HAVE A, AGAIN, A MERITORIOUS

17:47.020 --> 17:47.980
CLAIM, SIMPLY CHOOSE TO WALK

17:48.020 --> 17:49.980
AWAY.

17:50.020 --> 17:52.000
>> John: OKAY, REAL QUICK --

17:52.000 --> 17:52.020
GET FUCKED, CHAD, YOU HUMAN

17:52.020 --> 17:53.980
RAZOR BURN.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.980
BECAUSE REMEMBER, THESE HEARINGS

17:56.020 --> 17:56.980
ARE MIGRANTS' ONLY SHOT AT

17:57.020 --> 17:57.980
GETTING TO SAFETY.

17:58.020 --> 17:58.980
IT'S EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN

17:59.020 --> 18:01.980
WAITING FOR.

18:02.020 --> 18:04.980
AND IF THEY MISS THEIR HEARING,

18:05.020 --> 18:05.980
THEY LOSE THEIR CASE!

18:06.020 --> 18:07.000
SO A PERSON NOT SHOWING UP

18:07.000 --> 18:07.020
IN COURT AFTER YOU FORCE THEM

18:07.020 --> 18:07.980
TO WAIT IN A DANGEROUS AREA,

18:08.020 --> 18:09.980
WITHOUT ADEQUATE SHELTER OR

18:10.020 --> 18:10.980
SUPPORT ISN'T PROOF THEY WERE

18:11.020 --> 18:11.980
TRYING TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM, IT'S

18:12.020 --> 18:13.940
PROOF YOUR SYSTEM IS NOT FUCKING

18:14.000 --> 18:15.980
WORKING!

18:16.020 --> 18:17.980
AND FOR THE RECORD, THE

18:18.020 --> 18:19.980
GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE THESE

18:20.020 --> 18:22.980
HEARINGS PRETTY MS.ABLE.

18:23.020 --> 18:23.980
IT MAY BEAR NO DATE OR

18:24.020 --> 18:24.980
TIME, OR YOUR HEARING MAY BE

18:25.020 --> 18:27.000
SCHEDULED FOR WHEN THE COURTS

18:27.000 --> 18:27.020
AREN'T OPEN, INCLUDING ONE THAT

18:27.020 --> 18:29.980
WAS SCHEDULED AT 1:00 A.M.

18:30.020 --> 18:30.980
IT CAN BE HARD TO KNOW ABOUT ANY

18:31.020 --> 18:32.980
CHANGES TO DATE OF HEARINGS

18:33.020 --> 18:34.980
GIVEN THAT SOME BORDER PATROL

18:35.020 --> 18:35.980
AGENTS FILLING OUT FORMS FOR

18:36.020 --> 18:38.980
MIGRANTS HAVE WRITTEN IN

18:39.020 --> 18:39.980
"FACEBOOK" AS A STREET ADDRESS.

18:40.020 --> 18:41.980
ALL IN ALL, THE GOVERNMENT

18:42.020 --> 18:42.980
SYSTEM IS ABOUT AS EFFECTIVE

18:43.020 --> 18:43.980
AS PAINTING

18:44.020 --> 18:44.980
"MEET US AT THE PLACE" ON

18:45.020 --> 18:45.980
A RACCOON AND THROWING IT

18:46.020 --> 18:46.980
OVER THE WALL INTO MEXICO.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.000
GOOD LUCK GETTING THE

18:49.000 --> 18:49.960
INSTRUCTIONS, AND IF YOU DO,

18:50.000 --> 18:51.980
GOOD LUCK FIGURING OUT HOW TO

18:52.020 --> 18:52.980
FOLLOW THEM.

18:53.020 --> 18:55.000
SO THIS PROGRAM ALL BUT SHUT OFF

18:55.000 --> 18:55.960
THE PATHWAY FOR MANY ASYLUM

18:56.000 --> 18:56.980
SEEKERS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.

18:57.020 --> 18:57.980
BUT THAT SEEMINGLY WASN'T

18:58.020 --> 18:58.980
ENOUGH, BECAUSE THE

18:59.020 --> 18:59.980
ADMINISTRATION THEN CAME UP WITH

19:00.020 --> 19:02.980
"SAFE THIRD COUNTRY" AGREEMENTS.

19:03.020 --> 19:04.980
BASICALLY, THE U.S. MANAGED

19:05.020 --> 19:05.980
TO FORCE HONDURAS, GUATEMALA,

19:06.020 --> 19:06.980
AND EL SALVADOR TO SIGN UP TO

19:07.020 --> 19:09.980
THIS.

19:10.020 --> 19:10.980
AND IT MEANT THAT WE COULD BAR

19:11.020 --> 19:11.980
MIGRANTS FROM SEEKING ASYLUM

19:12.020 --> 19:12.980
HERE, AND SEND THEM TO APPLY FOR

19:13.020 --> 19:14.980
IT IN THOSE COUNTRIES INSTEAD.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.980
WHICH IS COMPLETELY ABSURD,

19:17.020 --> 19:17.980
SINCE FOR MANY MIGRANTS, THOSE

19:18.020 --> 19:19.980
ARE THE EXACT COUNTRIES THEY'RE

19:20.020 --> 19:22.980
SEEKING ASYLUM FROM.

19:23.020 --> 19:24.980
"OH, YOU'RE FLEEING HONDURAS?

19:25.020 --> 19:25.980
WHY NOT TRY EL SALVADOR!

19:26.020 --> 19:26.980
IT'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR SO YOU CAN

19:27.020 --> 19:27.980
STAY IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY,

19:28.020 --> 19:28.980
FRIENDS, AND THE PEOPLE WHO WANT

19:29.020 --> 19:29.980
TO MURDER YOU!"

19:30.020 --> 19:31.980
AND IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH,

19:32.020 --> 19:34.980
NONE OF THESE THREE COUNTRIES

19:35.020 --> 19:35.980
HAVE ROBUST ASYLUM SYSTEMS, AS

19:36.020 --> 19:36.980
THE PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR

19:37.020 --> 19:37.980
HIMSELF ADMITS.

19:38.020 --> 19:39.980
>> A MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S

19:40.020 --> 19:40.980
INNER CIRCLE SAID THAT ASYLUM

19:41.020 --> 19:43.980
SEEKERS COULD END UP STAYING IN

19:44.020 --> 19:44.980
EL SALVADOR, THAT THAT COULD

19:45.020 --> 19:45.980
HAPPEN.

19:46.020 --> 19:46.980
IS EL SALVADOR PREPARED FOR

19:47.020 --> 19:48.980
THAT?

19:49.020 --> 19:50.980
>> WELL, NOT RIGHT NOW.

19:51.020 --> 19:52.980
WE DON'T HAVE ASYLUM CAPACITIES,

19:53.020 --> 19:54.980
BUT WE CAN BUILD THEM.

19:55.020 --> 19:55.980
>> BUT YOU DON'T HAVE IT NOW.

19:56.020 --> 19:56.980
>> WE DON'T HAVE IT NOW.

19:57.020 --> 19:57.980
WHEN WE HAVE IT --

19:58.020 --> 19:59.000
>> AND IF HE SAID, "I CAN THROW

19:59.000 --> 19:59.020
UP A TENT."

19:59.020 --> 20:00.000
>> A TENT?

20:00.000 --> 20:00.020
THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S NOT ASYLUM

20:00.020 --> 20:00.980
CAPACITY.

20:01.020 --> 20:01.980
NO.

20:02.020 --> 20:03.980
>> John: NO.

20:04.020 --> 20:04.980
NO, IT REALLY ISN'T.

20:05.020 --> 20:05.980
THROWING UP A TENT DOESN'T

20:06.020 --> 20:06.980
INHERENTLY GIVE YOU ASYLUM

20:07.020 --> 20:07.980
CAPACITY.

20:08.020 --> 20:08.980
THERE ARE ONLY TWO THINGS

20:09.020 --> 20:09.980
THROWING UP A TENT CAN GIVE YOU:

20:10.020 --> 20:11.980
SHELTER FROM THE ELEMENTS, AND

20:12.020 --> 20:14.000
THE ARENA FOR A SHAME-BASED

20:14.000 --> 20:14.020
BAKING CRUCIBLE WHOSE ONLY PRIZE

20:14.020 --> 20:15.580
IS THE NARROW AVOIDANCE OF

20:16.000 --> 20:16.980
PUBLIC FAILURE.

20:17.020 --> 20:18.980
AND QUICK SIDE NOTE: WHY THE

20:19.020 --> 20:19.980
FUCK DID THE NEW SEASON OF

20:20.020 --> 20:20.980
"THE GREAT BRITISH BAKE-OFF"

20:21.020 --> 20:21.980
MAKE THE FIRST SHOWSTOPPER

20:22.020 --> 20:22.980
CHALLENGE "CELEBRITY CAKE

20:23.020 --> 20:23.980
BUSTS?"

20:24.020 --> 20:24.980
BECAUSE IT GAVE US SQUASHED

20:25.020 --> 20:26.980
FREDDIE MERCURY, SOMETHING

20:27.020 --> 20:27.980
THE BAKER INSISTED WAS

20:28.020 --> 20:29.980
LUPITA NYONG'O, AND A

20:30.020 --> 20:31.980
PHOTO PERFECT DAVID BOWIE.

20:32.020 --> 20:32.980
THAT BAKER DESERVES

20:33.020 --> 20:33.980
A PAUL HOLLYWOOD HANDSHAKE.

20:34.020 --> 20:34.980
THE REST OF YOU NEED TO THINK

20:35.020 --> 20:36.980
ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

20:37.020 --> 20:40.980
AND FORCING MIGRANTS TO SIT IN

20:41.020 --> 20:41.980
REFUGEE CAMPS OR SENDING THEM

20:42.020 --> 20:42.980
TO COUNTRIES WITH

20:43.020 --> 20:43.980
NON-FUNCTIONING ASYLUM SYSTEMS

20:44.020 --> 20:44.980
IS COMFORTABLY BAD ENOUGH,

20:45.020 --> 20:46.980
BEFORE YOU GET TO WHAT HAPPENED

20:47.020 --> 20:47.980
EARLIER THIS YEAR, WHEN

20:48.020 --> 20:49.980
THE ADMINISTRATION'S INVOKED

20:50.020 --> 20:52.980
TITLE 42 OF THE U.S. CODE.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.000
AND THAT ISN'T EVEN AN

20:55.000 --> 20:55.020
IMMIGRATION LAW.

20:55.020 --> 20:55.980
IT'S A PROVISION THAT GIVES THE

20:56.020 --> 20:56.980
GOVERNMENT BROAD POWER TO ACT

20:57.020 --> 20:58.980
DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

20:59.020 --> 20:59.980
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

21:00.020 --> 21:01.980
CURRENTLY CLAIMING THAT, BECAUSE

21:02.020 --> 21:02.980
OF THE PANDEMIC, IT GIVES THEM

21:03.020 --> 21:03.980
THE AUTHORITY TO SHUT DOWN THE

21:04.020 --> 21:05.980
BORDER TO VIRTUALLY ALL

21:06.020 --> 21:06.980
MIGRANTS.

21:07.020 --> 21:07.980
AND NOT JUST THAT -- THEY'RE

21:08.020 --> 21:08.980
ALSO CLAIMING THAT IT ALLOWS

21:09.020 --> 21:09.980
THEM TO TAKE ASYLUM SEEKERS

21:10.020 --> 21:11.980
WHO'VE ALREADY MADE IT INTO

21:12.020 --> 21:13.980
THE U.S., AND EXPEL THEM WITH NO

21:14.020 --> 21:17.980
DUE PROCESS WHATSOEVER.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.980
IT IS A TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT TO

21:20.020 --> 21:21.980
EXPLOIT THIS PANDEMIC TO DO WHAT

21:22.020 --> 21:22.980
THEY WANT WITH MIGRANTS --

21:23.020 --> 21:23.980
ALTHOUGH, MARK MORGAN, TRUMP'S

21:24.020 --> 21:24.980
HEAD OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER

21:25.020 --> 21:26.000
PROTECTION, HAS REPEATEDLY

21:26.000 --> 21:26.020
INSISTED THAT NOTHING COULD

21:26.020 --> 21:28.000
BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

21:29.000 --> 21:29.980
>> TITLE 42 HAS NOTHING TO DO

21:30.020 --> 21:31.980
WITH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.980
I'M GONNA SAY THAT AGAIN.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.980
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE.

21:36.020 --> 21:36.980
I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO SAY IT.

21:37.020 --> 21:38.980
TITLE 42 HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

21:39.020 --> 21:39.980
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AND

21:40.020 --> 21:41.980
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH

21:42.020 --> 21:43.980
PUBLIC HEALTH.

21:44.020 --> 21:46.980
>> John: YEAH, MARK, WE'RE AWARE

21:47.020 --> 21:47.980
YOU KEEP SAYING THIS HAS NOTHING

21:48.020 --> 21:49.980
TO DO WITH IMMIGRATION.

21:50.020 --> 21:50.980
BUT A TRUMP OFFICIAL SAYING HIS

21:51.020 --> 21:51.980
ACTIONS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

21:52.020 --> 21:52.980
IMMIGRATION IS ABOUT AS

21:53.020 --> 21:54.980
BELIEVABLE AS COOKIE MONSTER

21:55.020 --> 21:55.980
SAYING HIS ACTIONS HAVE NOTHING

21:56.020 --> 21:56.980
TO DO WITH COOKIES.

21:57.020 --> 21:57.980
BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY DO.

21:58.020 --> 21:59.640
THEY'RE THE THING YOU'RE SO

22:00.000 --> 22:00.980
OBSESSED WITH, IT LITERALLY

22:01.020 --> 22:02.980
MAKES YOU A MONSTER.

22:03.020 --> 22:03.980
AND IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO TAKE

22:04.020 --> 22:05.980
THIS ADMINISTRATION CITING THEIR

22:06.020 --> 22:07.340
DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE

22:08.000 --> 22:08.980
CORONAVIRUS, EVEN BEFORE YOU

22:09.020 --> 22:10.340
LEARN THAT THE CDC WAS

22:11.000 --> 22:11.980
APPARENTLY FORCED TO ISSUE THE

22:12.020 --> 22:14.000
TITLE 42 ORDER, DESPITE THEIR

22:15.000 --> 22:15.980
OWN SCIENTISTS SAYING THERE WAS

22:16.020 --> 22:16.980
NO EVIDENCE IT WOULD SLOW THE

22:17.020 --> 22:17.980
CORONAVIRUS.

22:18.020 --> 22:19.980
SO THIS CLEARLY HAS NOTHING TO

22:20.020 --> 22:21.980
DO WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AT ALL.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.980
AND IF YOU NEED ANY MORE PROOF,

22:24.020 --> 22:24.980
STEPHEN MILLER -- TRUMP'S TOP

22:25.020 --> 22:26.980
IMMIGRATION ADVISER AND WORLD'S

22:27.020 --> 22:28.980
TALLEST MINION -- HAS APPARENTLY

22:29.020 --> 22:30.980
BEEN TRYING TO INVOKE TITLE 42

22:31.020 --> 22:31.980
FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES LONG

22:32.020 --> 22:33.980
BEFORE COVID.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.980
HE REPORTEDLY PUSHED TO INVOKE

22:36.020 --> 22:36.980
IT TWICE LAST YEAR, ONCE WHEN

22:37.020 --> 22:37.980
AN OUTBREAK OF MUMPS SPREAD

22:38.020 --> 22:38.980
THROUGH IMMIGRATION DETENTION

22:39.020 --> 22:39.980
FACILITIES, AND AGAIN WHEN

22:40.020 --> 22:41.980
BORDER PATROL STATIONS WERE HIT

22:42.020 --> 22:42.980
WITH THE FLU.

22:43.020 --> 22:43.980
IN FACT, USING EMERGENCY

22:44.020 --> 22:45.980
PUBLIC HEALTH POWERS TO CURB

22:46.020 --> 22:47.760
IMMIGRATION WAS APPARENTLY ON

22:48.000 --> 22:48.980
A WISH LIST THAT MILLER CRAFTED

22:49.020 --> 22:49.980
WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF

22:50.020 --> 22:51.980
THE ADMINISTRATION.

22:52.020 --> 22:52.980
INCIDENTALLY, THE REST OF THAT

22:53.020 --> 22:54.980
WISH LIST WAS JUST WHAT LOOKS

22:55.020 --> 22:55.980
LIKE A HAND-DRAWN PICTURE OF

22:56.020 --> 22:57.980
A RIPPED STEPHEN MILLER AND

22:58.020 --> 22:58.980
"MAYBE AN ALL-WHITE REBOOT OF

22:59.020 --> 23:00.980
'HIDDEN FIGURES'?"

23:01.020 --> 23:06.980
CIRCLED THREE TIMES.

23:07.020 --> 23:07.980
AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHY THIS

23:08.020 --> 23:08.980
APPEALS SO MUCH TO MILLER.

23:09.020 --> 23:09.980
BECAUSE INVOKING TITLE 42

23:10.020 --> 23:11.000
HAS BASICALLY CREATED A SHADOW

23:11.000 --> 23:11.020
DEPORTATION SYSTEM THAT MOVES

23:11.020 --> 23:11.980
QUICKLY AND IS ACCOUNTABLE

23:12.020 --> 23:13.980
TO NO ONE.

23:14.020 --> 23:16.980
AND THEY'VE USED IT A LOT.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.580
SINCE MARCH, THERE'VE BEEN

23:19.000 --> 23:20.980
NEARLY 200,000 EXPULSIONS IN

23:21.020 --> 23:21.980
WHICH ASYLUM SEEKERS WERE SENT

23:22.020 --> 23:22.980
BACK WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A COURT

23:23.020 --> 23:25.980
HEARING.

23:26.020 --> 23:26.980
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS GONE OUT

23:27.020 --> 23:27.980
OF ITS WAY TO AVOID SCRUTINY.

23:28.020 --> 23:29.580
FOR EXAMPLE, UNACCOMPANIED

23:30.000 --> 23:30.980
MINORS ARE USUALLY KEPT IN

23:31.020 --> 23:31.980
SHELTERS, WHERE IMMIGRATION

23:32.020 --> 23:32.980
ATTORNEYS CAN FIND THEM, AND TRY

23:33.020 --> 23:34.980
AND HELP THEM WITH THEIR CASE.

23:35.020 --> 23:35.980
BUT BY CITING PUBLIC HEALTH

23:36.020 --> 23:36.980
CONCERNS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS

23:37.020 --> 23:38.980
INSTEAD BEEN QUIETLY KEEPING

23:39.020 --> 23:39.980
KIDS IN HOTELS, SUPERVISED BY

23:40.020 --> 23:40.980
PRIVATE CONTRACTORS.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.640
AND THE RARE GLIMPSES WE'VE

23:43.000 --> 23:44.980
GOTTEN OF THIS HAVE BEEN

23:45.020 --> 23:45.980
ABSOLUTELY CHILLING.

23:46.020 --> 23:46.980
JUST WATCH AS A CIVIL RIGHTS

23:47.020 --> 23:47.980
ATTORNEY TRIES TO HELP THE KIDS

23:48.020 --> 23:50.980
BUT GETS STOPPED.

23:51.020 --> 23:53.980
>> ARE YOU POLICE?

23:54.020 --> 23:57.980
ARE YOU POLICE?

23:58.020 --> 23:58.980
>> YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.000
>> CAN I ASK WHO YOU ARE?

24:02.000 --> 24:02.980
>> DESPERATELY TRYING TO

24:03.020 --> 24:03.980
COMMUNICATE TO CHILDREN, THE

24:04.020 --> 24:05.980
ASSOCIATED PLACE SO THEY ARE

24:06.020 --> 24:07.980
BEING HELD BY THE FOURTH FLOOR

24:08.020 --> 24:10.000
OF THE HILTON IN SUITES HOTEL IN

24:10.000 --> 24:10.020
McALLEN, TEXAS.

24:10.020 --> 24:13.000
>> IF YOU ARE DETAINED, GIVE ME

24:13.000 --> 24:13.020
HER NAME!

24:13.020 --> 24:14.980
>> GET OUT OF HERE.

24:15.020 --> 24:15.980
>> WHO ARE YOU?

24:16.020 --> 24:17.980
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHO WE ARE.

24:18.020 --> 24:18.980
>> ARE YOU POLICE?

24:19.020 --> 24:19.980
>> GET OUT.

24:20.020 --> 24:20.980
>> GET OUT.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.000
GET OUT.

24:22.000 --> 24:22.020
GET OUT NOW!

24:22.020 --> 24:22.980
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK IS

24:23.020 --> 24:23.980
HAPPENING THERE?

24:24.020 --> 24:25.000
ALTHOUGH I AM CURIOUS IF, AFTER

24:25.000 --> 24:25.020
THAT INTERACTION, THOSE MEN FELT

24:25.020 --> 24:26.980
THEY'D SUCCESSFULLY HIDDEN

24:27.020 --> 24:27.980
THE GOVERNMENT'S CHILD PRISON.

24:28.020 --> 24:29.700
"WHEW, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE!

24:30.000 --> 24:30.020
I GOT A BIT WORRIED WHEN HE

24:30.020 --> 24:31.980
ASKED "WHO ARE YOU," BUT THEN

24:32.020 --> 24:32.980
RANDY SAID, "DON'T WORRY WHO WE

24:33.020 --> 24:33.980
ARE."

24:34.020 --> 24:34.980
NICE SAVE THERE, RANDY!

24:35.020 --> 24:35.980
THAT'S THE LAST TIME ANYONE

24:36.020 --> 24:36.980
ASKS US QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS

24:37.020 --> 24:37.980
MYSTERIOUSLY OFF-LIMITS HOTEL

24:38.020 --> 24:38.980
FLOOR PACKED WITH TERRIFIED

24:39.020 --> 24:41.980
CHILDREN."

24:42.020 --> 24:43.980
NOW, INCIDENTALLY, OUR LAWYERS

24:44.020 --> 24:44.980
ARE INSISTING THAT I HAVE TO

24:45.020 --> 24:46.980
CLARIFY THAT THAT HAMPTON INN

24:47.020 --> 24:47.980
SAID THEY HAD MADE THOSE

24:48.020 --> 24:48.980
BOOKINGS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT

24:49.020 --> 24:50.000
THEY'D BE USED FOR, AND HAVE

24:50.000 --> 24:50.020
CANCELED THEIR BUSINESS.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.980
BECAUSE THE ENTITY YOU'RE

24:52.020 --> 24:52.980
DEFINITELY ANGRIEST AT RIGHT NOW

24:53.020 --> 24:55.980
IS THE HAMPTON FUCKING INN.

24:56.020 --> 24:56.980
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS

24:57.020 --> 24:57.980
TOGETHER, THIS ADMINISTRATION

24:58.020 --> 24:59.980
HAS EFFECTIVELY TAKEN AN ASYLUM

25:00.020 --> 25:02.980
SYSTEM THAT WAS ALREADY

25:03.020 --> 25:03.980
IMPERFECT AND SHATTERED IT.

25:04.020 --> 25:05.000
AND THE THING IS, THEY'RE NOW

25:05.000 --> 25:05.020
TRYING TO MAKE THIS DAMAGE

25:05.020 --> 25:05.980
PERMANENT.

25:06.020 --> 25:07.980
BECAUSE ALONG WITH EXTENDING

25:08.020 --> 25:08.980
TITLE 42 INDEFINITELY, THEY'VE

25:09.020 --> 25:10.980
DRAFTED NEW REGULATIONS THAT

25:11.020 --> 25:11.980
WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKE

25:12.020 --> 25:13.980
IT EASIER FOR IMMIGRATION JUDGES

25:14.020 --> 25:14.980
TO REJECT ASYLUM REQUESTS OUT OF

25:15.020 --> 25:15.980
HAND, MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT,

25:16.020 --> 25:18.000
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO WIN A CASE

25:19.000 --> 25:19.020
INVOLVING GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE

25:19.020 --> 25:20.980
OR GANG THREATS, AND MAKE IT SO

25:21.020 --> 25:22.980
MIGRANTS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT

25:23.020 --> 25:23.980
COMPLETE ASYLUM APPLICATIONS --

25:24.020 --> 25:24.980
WHICH HAVE TO BE IN ENGLISH, AND

25:25.020 --> 25:27.000
WITH ALL SUPPORTING EVIDENCE --

25:27.000 --> 25:27.020
WITHIN JUST 15 DAYS OF THEIR

25:27.020 --> 25:31.000
FIRST COURT HEARING.

25:32.000 --> 25:32.980
AND THAT IS REGARDLESS OF

25:33.020 --> 25:33.980
WHETHER THEY HAVE A LAWYER.

25:34.020 --> 25:34.980
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

25:35.020 --> 25:35.980
ATTACK ON THIS SYSTEM HAS JUST

25:36.020 --> 25:36.980
BEEN RELENTLESS.

25:37.020 --> 25:37.980
AND THERE ARE LIVES AT STAKE

25:38.020 --> 25:38.980
HERE.

25:39.020 --> 25:40.940
REMEMBER BERTA, WHO CAME HERE TO

25:41.000 --> 25:41.980
PROTECT HER 12-YEAR-OLD

25:42.020 --> 25:42.980
GRANDDAUGHTER?

25:43.020 --> 25:44.980
JUST WATCH HER LAWYER UPDATE HER

25:45.020 --> 25:47.980
ON THE OUTCOME OF HER CASE.

25:48.020 --> 25:50.000
>> WELL, HERE WE ARE.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.980
THE COURT APPEAL WAS REJECTED.

25:59.020 --> 26:00.980
>> THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ME.

26:01.020 --> 26:02.640
AND THEY WILL KILL ME RIGHT

26:03.000 --> 26:05.980
AWAY.

26:06.020 --> 26:06.980
I DON'T WANT TO --

26:07.020 --> 26:07.980
>> SO YOU ARE AFRAID?

26:08.020 --> 26:09.980
>> YES.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.980
I'M SCARED.

26:12.020 --> 26:13.980
>> John: YEAH, THE GOVERNMENT,

26:14.020 --> 26:16.980
ACTING ON OUR BEHALF, DEPORTED

26:17.020 --> 26:19.000
BERTA BACK TO HONDURAS, WHERE

26:19.000 --> 26:19.960
YOU SHOULD KNOW, SHE ONCE AGAIN

26:20.000 --> 26:20.980
FLED, AND IS CURRENTLY LIVING

26:21.020 --> 26:21.980
IN LIMBO IN MEXICO.

26:22.020 --> 26:23.980
AND THE TRAGIC THING IS, IN SOME

26:24.020 --> 26:24.980
WAYS, SHE'S LUCKIER THAN MANY

26:25.020 --> 26:26.980
ASYLUM SEEKERS.

26:27.020 --> 26:27.980
SHE AT LEAST HAD A LAWYER AND

26:28.020 --> 26:29.980
HER CASE WAS HEARD.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.980
BUT FOR SO MANY, ESPECIALLY NOW,

26:32.020 --> 26:32.980
THERE'S JUST NO TELLING IF OR

26:33.020 --> 26:34.980
WHEN THEY'LL EVEN GET THAT FAR.

26:35.020 --> 26:35.980
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING, "WELL,

26:36.020 --> 26:39.000
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS?"

26:39.000 --> 26:39.020
THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE THING YOU

26:39.020 --> 26:40.980
CAN DO.

26:41.020 --> 26:42.980
YOU CAN VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.000
AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS

26:45.000 --> 26:45.960
SIMPLISTIC, ESPECIALLY

26:46.000 --> 26:46.980
CONSIDERING THAT OUR IMMIGRATION

26:47.020 --> 26:47.980
POLICY HAS BEEN PRETTY SHITTY

26:48.020 --> 26:49.940
UNDER DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS

26:50.000 --> 26:50.980
TOO, LIKE THE ONE JOE BIDEN WAS

26:51.020 --> 26:54.980
IN FOR EIGHT YEARS.

26:55.020 --> 26:55.980
AND I AM NOT SAYING HE'S THE

26:56.020 --> 26:56.980
PERFECT CANDIDATE, FAR FROM IT.

26:57.020 --> 26:57.980
I PERSONALLY FIND HIS OPPOSITION

26:58.020 --> 26:59.980
TO MEDICARE FOR ALL UTTERLY

27:00.020 --> 27:00.980
RIDICULOUS, ESPECIALLY IN

27:01.020 --> 27:02.980
THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.

27:03.020 --> 27:03.980
ALSO, I THINK AVIATOR GLASSES

27:04.020 --> 27:05.980
SHOULD ONLY BE WORN BY

27:06.020 --> 27:06.980
HOT PILOTS, CUTE BABIES, AND

27:07.020 --> 27:09.980
CUTE BABY PILOTS.

27:10.020 --> 27:10.980
BUT THE FACT IS, A LOT OF OUR

27:11.020 --> 27:12.980
IMMIGRATION POLICY IS SET SOLELY

27:13.020 --> 27:14.980
BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

27:15.020 --> 27:16.980
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, BIDEN HAS

27:17.020 --> 27:19.000
EXPLICITLY PROMISED TO END THE

27:20.000 --> 27:20.980
REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY AND

27:21.020 --> 27:21.980
RESTORE ASYLUM ELIGIBILITY FOR

27:22.020 --> 27:22.980
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AND

27:23.020 --> 27:27.980
VICTIMS OF GANG PERSECUTION.

27:28.020 --> 27:29.100
AND THOSE COULD BE

27:30.000 --> 27:30.020
LIFE-SAVING CHANGES.

27:30.020 --> 27:30.980
ONE IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY WE

27:31.020 --> 27:31.980
SPOKE WITH HAS SAID,

27:32.020 --> 27:33.980
"I SPEND HOURS EVERY DAY TELLING

27:34.020 --> 27:40.000
ASYLUM-SEEKERS STUCK IN MEXICO,

27:40.000 --> 27:40.020
"WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL NOVEMBER

27:40.020 --> 27:41.000
THIRD."

27:41.000 --> 27:41.540
THEY CRY.

27:42.000 --> 27:42.020
THEY PRAY.

27:42.020 --> 27:42.980
THEY ASK ABOUT THE LATEST POLLS.

27:43.020 --> 27:43.980
I SHOW MY COUNTDOWN TIMER.

27:44.020 --> 27:45.980
THEY SHOW ME THEIR SCARS."

27:46.020 --> 27:47.980
AND OBVIOUSLY, BIDEN WILL HAVE

27:48.020 --> 27:49.980
TO DO A LOT MORE, AND WE'LL HAVE

27:50.020 --> 27:50.980
TO HOLD HIM TO THE PROMISES HE'S

27:51.020 --> 27:51.980
MADE, BUT WE CAN'T BEGIN

27:52.020 --> 27:53.820
TO FIX THE DAMAGE DONE BY THIS

27:54.000 --> 27:54.980

27:55.020 --> 27:56.980

27:57.020 --> 27:58.980
IF WE EVEN WANT A SHOT

27:59.020 --> 28:01.980
AT CHANGE, IT'S ON US TO VOTE,

28:02.020 --> 28:02.980
AND THEN ADVOCATE LIKE LIVES

28:03.020 --> 28:04.980
DEPEND ON IT.

28:05.020 --> 28:06.980
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, WE BADLY

28:07.020 --> 28:07.980
NEED AN ASYLUM SYSTEM THAT

28:08.020 --> 28:09.980
WORKS.
