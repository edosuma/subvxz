WEBVTT

01:56.041 --> 01:58.708
Master Am, we have completed
all of the final adjustments

01:58.791 --> 02:00.666
on the Gemini-class Star Destroyer.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.416
We are ready to deploy
and are awaiting your command.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.000
At last. The moment arrives.

02:07.083 --> 02:10.875
Ever since you and
your brother were delivered to our care,

02:10.958 --> 02:12.416
I have watched you grow,

02:12.500 --> 02:16.625
and now I will finally be able
to witness you complete your mission.

02:17.250 --> 02:21.625
Oh, I must admit,
it has been quite the journey.

02:22.291 --> 02:25.166
The journey has only just begun,
B-2ON.

02:26.166 --> 02:30.083
With this new power, my brother
and I will bring order to the galaxy.

02:30.166 --> 02:32.791
Something no one else
has been able to accomplish.

02:33.583 --> 02:37.875
This is our mission, as twins created
through the power of the dark side.

02:39.708 --> 02:43.541
Master Am, Central Control is reporting
that final adjustments to the hyper cannon

02:43.625 --> 02:46.333
have been completed,
and it will soon be operational.

02:47.166 --> 02:50.291
Will the weapon's firepower be
at full strength?

02:51.625 --> 02:53.541
Yes. It is charging now.

02:54.458 --> 02:58.916
High-purity energy must be extracted
from our power source in the central core.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.583
It is the same power
that is transferred into the dark armor

03:01.666 --> 03:04.208
that you and your brother,
Master Karre, wear.

03:04.750 --> 03:08.541
Once the refined dark energy is unleashed
through the ship's hyper cannon,

03:08.625 --> 03:13.500
it will easily be capable of destroying
a planet or any resistant star systems.

03:14.041 --> 03:15.666
-Hmm.
-However,

03:15.750 --> 03:18.958
I am concerned about the effect
this prototype dark armor could have

03:19.041 --> 03:21.916
on your physical body,
as well as that of your brother.

03:23.416 --> 03:24.916
There's no need to worry.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.333
From the moment I was born,

03:26.416 --> 03:30.083
I was prepared to sacrifice everything
for the dark side.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.750
Oh, Master Am,
your allegiance is inspiring.

03:32.833 --> 03:35.500
I will be forever the humble servant
to you and your brother

03:35.583 --> 03:37.125
until the day my functions cease.

03:37.208 --> 03:38.625
I will hold you to that.

03:38.708 --> 03:41.791
Now let's surprise
those peace-loving Republic fools.

03:41.875 --> 03:43.083
Ready the hyper cannon.

03:43.166 --> 03:45.041
Hyper cannon, prepare to fire.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.416
-Huh?

03:47.500 --> 03:51.416
I have just received an incoming alert
from Central Block B-25.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.708
The power source from the reactor core
appears to have been stolen!

03:54.791 --> 03:56.666
We cannot charge the hyper cannon.

03:56.750 --> 03:57.958
What?

03:58.041 --> 04:01.541
But only Master Am and Master Karre
can access the reactor core chamber--

04:04.625 --> 04:08.375
Master Karre is gone.
Where could he be at a time like this?

04:08.958 --> 04:10.125
Karre…

04:13.583 --> 04:16.708
Don't worry, R-DUO.
Everything's gonna be fine.

04:16.791 --> 04:18.000
They won't find us.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.291
Freeze!

04:22.833 --> 04:24.875
Okay, you told me so.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.541
Lord Karre,
please return the power core.

04:28.625 --> 04:30.083
This is your last warning.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.083
Set for stun and open fire!

04:35.625 --> 04:37.500
What?

04:38.750 --> 04:40.250
Don't give up. Keep firing!

04:40.333 --> 04:41.416
So sorry.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.500
Come on, R-DUO.
Let's get out of here.

04:57.416 --> 04:59.500
The ship is right
where we left it.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.625
-R-DUO.

05:12.625 --> 05:16.625
Karre.
Where are you planning on going with that?

05:16.708 --> 05:18.875
To a galaxy far, far away.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.541
Don't be a fool.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.375
Hand me the power core,
and I'll forget this ever happened.

05:26.458 --> 05:29.458
Master Karre, this is quite disappointing.

05:29.541 --> 05:30.875
Now hand it over.

05:36.916 --> 05:38.375
I refuse!

05:40.625 --> 05:43.500
What do you want to do
with the power core?

05:43.583 --> 05:46.000
Are you planning to turn it over
to the Republic?

05:46.083 --> 05:49.708
The Galactic Empire or the Republic,

05:49.791 --> 05:52.666
I couldn't care less
about either one of them!

05:52.750 --> 05:55.125
You really don't care?

05:55.208 --> 05:58.875
Yeah. Even if I explained it to you,
you'd never understand.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.291
Are you out of your mind?

06:02.208 --> 06:05.041
As you wish, you fool.

06:05.125 --> 06:08.625
If you won't hand it over,
then I'll take it by force!

06:18.625 --> 06:20.000
What?

06:27.166 --> 06:29.458
Nice work, R-DUO!
Now keep firing!

06:30.625 --> 06:33.375
Great. Now get ready to punch it!

06:49.125 --> 06:51.791
-Really?

06:51.875 --> 06:55.000
So, you have a bad feeling about this?

06:55.083 --> 06:56.583
R-DUO, what's happening?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.375
You're wrong!
It's no tractor beam! It's Am!

07:12.958 --> 07:16.583
I can't! She's too strong in the Force!

07:16.666 --> 07:18.541
She's going for the power core.

07:19.375 --> 07:21.500
I found it. Come to me.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.291
Am, no!

07:40.458 --> 07:41.583
Hmm?

07:45.625 --> 07:47.500
Not bad, Karre.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.708
-I'm impressed.

07:58.041 --> 08:03.208
Kyber crystal.
What beauty. Such power.

08:03.291 --> 08:07.041
This energy will be the beacon of hope
for the galaxy!

08:07.125 --> 08:08.416
Now come to me!

08:10.083 --> 08:12.083
I won't let you have it!

08:12.166 --> 08:14.500
This power it holds is anything but hope!

08:14.583 --> 08:18.916
The only thing that this crystal
can possibly bring is despair!

09:01.625 --> 09:04.666
What is that? Is that me?

09:04.750 --> 09:07.166
That's right. It is you, Am.

09:07.250 --> 09:11.500
It was through the Force that I was able
to see the future that awaits you, Sister.

09:12.083 --> 09:15.125
My future? I don't believe you.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.791
How come you can see it and not I?

09:18.791 --> 09:20.708
I don't have the answer.

09:20.791 --> 09:25.000
But the one thing I do know is that
if you use the power of the kyber crystal,

09:25.083 --> 09:28.666
as I have foreseen in the vision,
then you will…

09:28.750 --> 09:30.500
I will die?

09:30.583 --> 09:34.541
Surely that's not the reason
you stole it? To save me.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.791
Yes, that's correct.

09:36.875 --> 09:39.250
However,
even if I had told you about this,

09:39.333 --> 09:41.458
you would have never listened to me.

09:41.541 --> 09:43.875
I know you, and you are stubborn, Am.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.541
Regardless,
I wasn't about to just let you die.

09:46.625 --> 09:47.625
And so that's why I--

09:52.833 --> 09:54.375
Do you think I fear death?

09:54.458 --> 09:55.875
No, don't!

09:56.416 --> 09:58.333
Did you forget, Karre?

09:58.416 --> 10:01.916
We are twins born
from the dark side of the Force.

10:02.958 --> 10:04.708
We were made to bring back order

10:04.791 --> 10:08.083
with this power
that transcends even death itself!

10:08.166 --> 10:10.541
Must I remind you
of the purpose of your birth?

10:10.625 --> 10:12.250
Don't do this!

10:12.333 --> 10:16.541
If you use that crystal, its power
will end up completely engulfing you.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.041
Listen to me, Am.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.250
You have to stop this
or it will destroy you!

10:20.333 --> 10:22.500
I will prove you wrong, brother.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.916
Don't you worry. Just watch.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.250
I will make death yield to me!

10:27.333 --> 10:30.833
And I'll do it with the power
of the dark side flowing through my body!

10:31.541 --> 10:32.791
No!

10:42.833 --> 10:46.833
Karre, if you really want to save me,
then go ahead!

10:46.916 --> 10:49.833
Try and take it from me!

10:57.958 --> 10:59.416
I need to act.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.333
That's it!

11:02.791 --> 11:04.041
I can use this!

11:06.666 --> 11:10.125
You won't be able to hide from me forever!

11:19.250 --> 11:20.708
What is this?

11:33.791 --> 11:34.791
Oh.

12:00.750 --> 12:04.125
Save me? You can't even save yourself.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.291
Do you know what your weakness is?

12:10.375 --> 12:15.250
It's that you're too afraid of death!

12:17.291 --> 12:21.583
I shall send you back
to the galaxy as dust!

12:30.333 --> 12:34.416
-R-DUO!

12:35.250 --> 12:36.250
Where's Am?

12:45.166 --> 12:47.708
Am has released too much power
from the crystal.

12:47.791 --> 12:51.083
She can no longer control it,
and now her armor is overloading.

12:53.250 --> 12:57.041
If we don't destroy that thing
as quickly as possible, it will kill her.

12:57.125 --> 13:00.875
However, it would take a massive amount
of power to do that.

13:01.375 --> 13:04.791
What if I'm not strong enough
to save her? What do I do?

13:09.250 --> 13:12.041
The hyperdrive? Maybe.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.875
If I use the power of the ship's
propulsion system, then it just might…

13:17.291 --> 13:18.916
And my lightsaber!

13:19.000 --> 13:21.958
I'm just not sure if I'll be able
to try something so reckless--

13:22.041 --> 13:24.083
-R-DUO!

13:32.250 --> 13:35.208
You're right, R-DUO.
It's just like you said.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.166
There is no try, only do.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.750
I can make this work!

14:03.458 --> 14:08.083
If this crystal is destroyed,
our entire life's mission will be lost!

14:08.166 --> 14:09.791
No, that isn't true!

14:09.875 --> 14:11.000
How so?

14:11.083 --> 14:12.875
Don't live for someone else!

14:12.958 --> 14:15.750
As long as you're alive,
then you are free.

14:15.833 --> 14:19.333
And you're free
to choose your own destiny!

14:19.416 --> 14:20.500
-Punch it!

14:49.500 --> 14:51.250
Oh, Master Am…

15:46.083 --> 15:48.625
Yeah, that's right, R-DUO. We did it.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.500
It's fine. Don't worry. We'll find her.

15:54.041 --> 15:55.291
She's somewhere out there.

15:55.375 --> 16:01.041
The key to understanding our purpose,
the reason why she and I were created.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.958
She's out there.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.416
Yeah, she's alive.

16:08.916 --> 16:09.916
I can feel it.

16:11.208 --> 16:14.500
After all, she is my twin sister.
