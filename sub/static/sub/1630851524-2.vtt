13:31.201 --> 13:33.813
- What about the sprinklers?
Don't they work?

13:33.856 --> 13:34.944
- Oh, they haven't worked
in months.

13:34.988 --> 13:35.945
I kept meaning
to get 'em fixed,

13:35.989 --> 13:37.338
but every time I went to make--

13:37.381 --> 13:43.866
<i>♪</i>

13:43.910 --> 13:45.346
- Let's call it arson.

13:55.399 --> 14:02.537
<i>♪</i>

14:04.060 --> 14:06.410
<i>- I killed that man.</i>

14:08.673 --> 14:11.763
Sean Mulaney would still be
alive if I hadn't hesitated.

14:13.548 --> 14:16.333
I knew he needed my help.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.639
Just...

14:21.338 --> 14:24.472
Felt like I had to
prove my loyalty.

14:24.515 --> 14:27.518
- You are walking
a very tight rope.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.086
That's a dangerous place
to be, Elliot.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.354
Someone probably
thought I was dead.

14:40.488 --> 14:43.708
I--I didn't think
quickly enough.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.542
- When Gina died...

14:54.067 --> 14:55.764
You remember what you told me?

14:57.853 --> 15:03.859
You told me that sometimes,
we lose a few to save a lot.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.473
- I don't know
if I still believe that.

15:09.517 --> 15:12.520
- Well, neither do I, but...

15:12.563 --> 15:16.916
You know, sometimes, we just
have to remind ourselves

15:16.959 --> 15:19.962
that what we're doing
is worth doing.

15:25.359 --> 15:29.102
I can take you out.
We can find another way at him.

15:29.145 --> 15:30.842
- No, I'm almost on the inside.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.936
I'm good. It's good.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.808
You just got to promise me
one thing.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.245
That fire can't be
ruled an arson.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.420
If it's arson, the family

15:43.464 --> 15:46.858
doesn't get
the insurance money.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.556
- Yeah.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.736
We don't want to take up
a lot of your time.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.520
We just want to find out
if you know anything

15:56.564 --> 16:00.002
about your husband's
financial arrangements.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.874
- We've been paying off
the Italians for years now.

16:02.918 --> 16:06.530
And then a couple of days ago,
the Albanians show up

16:06.574 --> 16:08.706
and say the money
goes to them now.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.927
- They raise the price?
- 30%

16:13.189 --> 16:15.148
Who can pay that,
even in the best of times?

16:15.191 --> 16:16.323
We're a bagel shop.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.325
- Did your husband
have a point person?

16:18.368 --> 16:21.589
He ever mention anyone's name?
- Guy named Reggie.

16:21.632 --> 16:22.851
That guy is crazy.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.853
At least with the Italians,

16:24.896 --> 16:27.551
we knew what we had to pay
and when.

16:27.595 --> 16:31.164
But with these guys,
the Albanians,

16:31.207 --> 16:33.862
they just do whatever they want
whenever they want it.

16:33.905 --> 16:36.125
- They think your husband
burned the place down,

16:36.169 --> 16:37.518
made it look like an accident

16:37.561 --> 16:38.998
so you could get
the insurance money.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.522
- And keep their boot
off your neck.

16:41.565 --> 16:45.004
- Our son is on his way
to college.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.919
We worked 20 years
to pay for it.

16:47.963 --> 16:51.271
The Albanians tried
to take that money.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.142
- I understand.

16:53.186 --> 16:56.102
- We are good people.
We didn't deserve this.

17:01.281 --> 17:05.415
- K-O likes to kill
and put their work on display.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.635
Three bodies
in less than two days.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.767
All of the crime scenes
destroyed.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.117
They're building up
to something.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.076
- Feels like a spree.
- Ah-

17:14.120 --> 17:17.253
Just got a tip from the tips.
- What?

17:17.297 --> 17:19.647
- The fingertips Stabler lifted
from the crime scene.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.257
The--the prints are back.
- And?

17:21.301 --> 17:23.781
- The people who were
burned in the fire were

17:23.825 --> 17:26.001
Jerry Milanesi
and Marco Dornetto.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.569
High level Italian gangsters.
- They're working together.

17:28.612 --> 17:32.051
The K-O and the Marcy Killers
are going after the Italians

17:32.094 --> 17:33.835
and their territory.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.838
Now that Manfredi Sinatra
is dead, they're weakened.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.318
This is just a first step.

17:38.361 --> 17:39.493
- And they're not
gonna stop until

17:39.536 --> 17:40.972
they're the only ones
left standing.

17:41.016 --> 17:44.150
- It feels like a spree
because it is a spree.

17:47.283 --> 17:51.418
- Hey, honey, that bread
isn't good for the ducks.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.507
Here, give them some
of my grapes.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.728
There, that's better for them.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.863
- They're not eating
the grapes.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.125
They like the bread.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.475
- Well, yeah,
because it's junk food

18:05.519 --> 18:08.261
like Cheetos or candy bars.

18:08.304 --> 18:11.655
If you stop feeding it to them,
they'll eat the grapes.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.136
- Everyone throws bread
in the pond.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.226
- Yeah, why do you think they
have so many health problems?

18:17.270 --> 18:20.011
Their wings don't even work.
See, look at that.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.057
That's what I'm talking about.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.060
After being fed crap
all day long.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.497
- You're not supposed
to say crap.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.195
- Yeah, well,
that's what it is.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.544
Come on, now.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.895
We got to look out
for our animal friends.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.463
That's enough.
- Hey, give me that back!

18:36.506 --> 18:38.856
- No.

18:38.900 --> 18:43.470
Oh, Elliot, I told you
no feeding the ducks.

18:43.513 --> 18:44.949
- Mom!

18:44.993 --> 18:46.995
- Hey, what did you do
to my kid?

18:47.038 --> 18:48.866
Julian, are you okay?
- She hit me.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.868
- Oh, God.
- Don't you move, lady.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.740
Stop that woman.
She attacked my son.

18:52.783 --> 18:56.004
Hey, stop her.
- Hey! Hey, lady.

18:56.047 --> 18:59.921
Hey, what's going on? Hey.
- Let me go.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.401
What are you doing?
Let go of me.

19:01.444 --> 19:02.924
Do you know who I am?

19:02.967 --> 19:05.883
My son is a high ranking member
of this police force.

19:05.927 --> 19:08.147
I need to talk to him now.

19:08.190 --> 19:11.062
- And my son is the mayor,
could you get him on the phone?

19:11.106 --> 19:13.239
- You--you--you have to
let me out of here.

19:13.282 --> 19:16.067
I--no, I didn't mean
to hurt that boy.

19:16.111 --> 19:19.158
That was a mistake.
I made a mistake.

19:20.681 --> 19:24.598
Get me my son,
Detective Elliot Stabler.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.730
I need to talk to him now.
- Ma'am--

19:26.774 --> 19:28.384
- My son, I need
to talk to him.

19:28.428 --> 19:31.039
- Ma'am, ma'am,
everything's going to be okay.

19:31.082 --> 19:33.737
Okay?
- Are you letting me out?

19:33.781 --> 19:36.523
- Hey, just come with me.
All right, come with me.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.351
I'm gonna take you
to a safe place.

19:38.394 --> 19:41.005
Okay, listen, I know you
don't know who I am.

19:41.049 --> 19:44.748
I'm Sergeant Bell.
I'm your son's partner.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.925
- His partner?
What do you mean?

19:47.969 --> 19:49.927
- Yeah, I'm unable to get
in touch with him right now,

19:49.971 --> 19:52.191
so I just--I need you
to come with me,

19:52.234 --> 19:55.803
and I'll keep trying, okay?
- Okay.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.897
- Mrs. Stabler.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.206
- Hi, Mama.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.253
- Who are you?

20:11.297 --> 20:14.256
- It's me, Elliot.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.389
Oh, hey.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.261
It's all right.
You're all right now.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.221
Thank you.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.702
- Is it really you?
- Yeah, it's really me.

20:27.051 --> 20:30.446
- Why are you hiding?
- I'm not hiding.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.796
Oh, this is--this is work.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.581
- No, no,
I meant you were gone.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.409
You left.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.541
- Yeah, I've been in Europe.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.413
In Europe. We went to Rome.

20:40.456 --> 20:43.981
We've been living in Rome.
- Living in Rome.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.462
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I remember that.

20:46.506 --> 20:47.637
- Right?
- Yeah.

20:47.681 --> 20:50.858
But why didn't you visit?

20:50.901 --> 20:52.207
- We visited.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.774
We've been back
about four times.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.776
Remember?
- You did?

20:55.819 --> 20:58.692
Yeah, me and Kathy,
we brought the kids over.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.302
Christmas.

21:02.043 --> 21:06.308
- Yes, I remember.
I remember Kath--oh.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.005
- What's the matter?
- Elliot, I--

21:08.049 --> 21:10.573
I just remembered your wife.

21:10.617 --> 21:14.882
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

21:14.925 --> 21:18.581
- It's okay.
- You know, I--I meant to--

21:18.625 --> 21:22.368
I--I know I missed it,
but I was going to attend,

21:22.411 --> 21:27.329
and then I'm not sure
what happened.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.896
I think I had an episode.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.899
- You been taking
your medication?

21:31.942 --> 21:35.119
- Well, I changed my pills
because I felt okay.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.773
You know,
I thought it was fine.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.080
- Okay, Mom. Okay.

21:39.123 --> 21:42.039
- I'm so sorry, honey.

21:42.083 --> 21:46.696
I'm just so sorry
your beautiful bride.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.003
How was Olivia's funeral?

21:52.006 --> 21:53.529
<i>♪</i>

21:53.573 --> 21:55.226
- It was beautiful.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.457
- Now, it might be
a little untidy here.

22:11.721 --> 22:14.376
Ah, I'm so dry.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.378
Will somebody
get me some water, please?

22:16.422 --> 22:17.727
- Yeah, I'll get you
some water.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.860
- Thank you.
He's such a sweet boy.

22:19.903 --> 22:22.428
- Yeah. What's with the cats?
- Huh?

22:22.471 --> 22:25.474
- Where'd you get the cats?
- Oh, in the neighborhood.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.042
You know, every one of them
needed a home.

22:28.085 --> 22:31.175
We have to look out
for our animal friends.

22:31.219 --> 22:33.482
- Mm, yeah.

22:33.526 --> 22:34.744
When was the last time
you checked on her?

22:34.788 --> 22:36.180
- It was, like,
three months ago,

22:36.224 --> 22:38.313
but she had a caretaker.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.968
Grandma, what happened to Rosa?

22:41.011 --> 22:42.404
- Who?

22:42.448 --> 22:44.972
- Rosa, the woman
who was coming in to help you.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.539
- Oh, she was horrible.

22:46.582 --> 22:49.193
She kept bossing me around.
I fired her.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.544
- You can't fire--we hired her.
You can't fire her.

22:51.587 --> 22:54.851
- Yeah, yeah I can.
I can and I did.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.418
- Mama--

22:56.462 --> 22:57.506
- And just stop trying
to control--

22:57.550 --> 22:59.160
- I'm not trying
to control you.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.857
This is not okay.

23:00.901 --> 23:04.470
- Grandma, when was the last
time you went to the doctor?

23:04.513 --> 23:07.211
- Oh, I don't know.
A couple of months probably.

23:07.255 --> 23:11.041
- And that's not okay.
That's not okay.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.392
Ma--Mama--

23:13.435 --> 23:15.872
Mama, let's go to the hospital,
we'll get your vitals checked.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.874
- I am not going back
to that hospital.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.442
That is a nut house.
- It's not a nut house.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.748
- Don't yell at me.

23:24.751 --> 23:28.189
- It's a facility
that is very qualified

23:28.232 --> 23:30.321
to deal with people
with your issues.

23:30.365 --> 23:33.499
- No, they are not qualified
to deal with anybody's issue.

23:33.542 --> 23:36.502
Get it. They're no good.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.460
I--I'm not going back there.

23:38.504 --> 23:41.028
I'd rather stay here
and die if I have to.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.641
Oh, God.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.952
Every time I think I got
this thing, like,

23:51.995 --> 23:54.911
"I think I'm okay.
It's not gonna come back.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.000
I'm fine."

23:57.044 --> 23:59.742
And then, you know.

23:59.786 --> 24:05.748
I'm 82 years old.
I just can't figure normal.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.489
- I know.

24:07.533 --> 24:11.667
Grandma, I know,
but I love you.

24:13.408 --> 24:17.456
We all love you.
Please let us help you.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.809
Maybe you should
come stay with us for a bit?

24:22.852 --> 24:24.637
- Oh--
- Yeah--

24:24.680 --> 24:26.465
Yeah, you totally should.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.512
- It's a good idea.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.601
That's a good idea.
We should do that.

24:32.645 --> 24:35.125
- Mm-hmm.
- Stay with us.

24:35.169 --> 24:38.085
- That's the thing.
Let's just--please stay with--

24:38.128 --> 24:41.349
- You really want me to?
- I really want you to.

24:41.392 --> 24:42.959
Stay with us,
and we'll figure it out.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.178
- Sh--should I clean up?

24:44.221 --> 24:45.832
- No, I want you to just take

24:45.875 --> 24:47.529
and bring her back
to our place,

24:47.573 --> 24:52.316
and I'll try to be there
for the weekend, okay?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.493
- But what about the cats?

24:54.536 --> 24:55.929
- I'll take care of the cats,
Grandma.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.497
- Really? You really will?

38:28.349 --> 38:30.482
- Why don't you have a seat?

38:39.012 --> 38:41.449
I know who you are.

38:43.190 --> 38:45.148
I had my people check you out.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.370
Eddie Ashes.

38:51.111 --> 38:52.808
You know, I'll tell you
something--

38:52.852 --> 38:55.202
you might not be Albanian,

38:55.245 --> 38:58.379
but you got Albanian balls,
my friend.

38:59.467 --> 39:01.643
You showed us
you have our back,

39:01.687 --> 39:02.949
and I commend
that kind of loyalty.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.733
- Thank you.

39:04.777 --> 39:09.651
- No, hey, hey, thank you.
- Thank you.

39:09.695 --> 39:13.220
- Hey, Albi,
we're doing the thing.

39:18.094 --> 39:20.836
You're gonna use this
to keep in touch.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.534
It's been checked for bugs.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.320
Look at me. Look at me.

39:26.364 --> 39:30.280
If you're in our circle,
you got to stay clean.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.544
- Clean.
- That's right.

39:34.284 --> 39:38.071
- Hey, Eddie,
you all right, brother?

39:46.601 --> 39:50.213
- Relax.
You're in the family now.
