00:09.801 --> 00:11.761
[Alexa] Since Katie had been kicked off
Chore Cats,

00:11.845 --> 00:14.556
she had to find a new job
to raise the money for London.

00:14.639 --> 00:17.559
Luckily, I know all
of Katie's personal information.

00:17.642 --> 00:21.312
So the two of us can fill out twice
as many applications in half the time.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.190
You're okay handling hot metals, right?

00:25.066 --> 00:28.028
I once took a spoon
out of the dishwasher mid-cycle.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.154
So, yes.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.906
All right.
Well, then let's make this happen.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.242
We are going to visualize you
getting a job.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.786
I learned this in my support group.
Close your eyes.

00:38.747 --> 00:42.125
Picture the perfect job.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.795
Imagine yourself getting hired.

00:46.337 --> 00:48.673
See yourself working there.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.009
Open your eyes.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.929
[audience laughing]

00:55.055 --> 00:56.306
How did you do that?

00:57.932 --> 00:59.100
I don't know.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.646
[chuckles] How perfect would this be?

01:03.730 --> 01:04.689
So perfect.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.733
Oh! Um, Barry...

01:06.816 --> 01:08.151
Mr. Barry.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.987
I am officially applying for the job.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.490
Okay. Write your name and number
on here.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.119
Terrific.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.081
Now, I'll be in touch... never.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.749
No, I'm serious.

01:23.374 --> 01:24.209
Please.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.044
Pretty please.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.670
Yeah, give her a chance!

01:27.962 --> 01:30.173
Yeah, please! I'm really great.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.967
You'll love her. Everyone loves her.
She's the best.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.136
If I say yes, will you stop talking?

01:36.721 --> 01:38.681
Friday. Five o'clock.
Come in for an interview.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.600
[chuckles]

01:41.267 --> 01:42.602
What are you doing?

01:42.936 --> 01:45.772
Visualizing you giving me your cookie.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.857

02:31.067 --> 02:32.569
-Wait...
-[Dylan] Nope.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.738
[chuckles]
Is that the picture you took yesterday?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.448
How often do you change these out?

02:38.116 --> 02:39.325
I don't know.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.618
Not that often.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.412
Probably, like, every...

02:42.787 --> 02:44.080
single...

02:44.539 --> 02:45.373
day.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.377
Well, it's super dorky and super cute.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.088
Strawberries! Brand new shirt!

02:52.213 --> 02:54.716
[grunts] Ugh! Another Mendoza.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.760
What did I ever do to deserve being stuck
with your brother

02:57.844 --> 02:58.970
as my cooking class partner?

02:59.429 --> 03:02.223
Well, a lot of not-so-great things.
You call people names.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.766
-You gossip.
-You're a snob.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.435
I saw you yell at that puppy once--

03:05.518 --> 03:07.729
Every day, Lucas pretends
to cut his thumb off,

03:07.812 --> 03:09.689
then spray something
right across the room.

03:09.814 --> 03:13.693
Not some days, not once in a while.
Every... day.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.070
Jerks! This is ridiculous!

03:16.237 --> 03:18.740
I can't believe
Lucas is tormenting Gwenny.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.451
It's nice when families
can do things together.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.998
[grunts] Ugh! Jelly-spraying, annoying,
overgrown gorilla child!

03:27.624 --> 03:28.625
No, he's not.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.668
Lucas is sweet and cute,

03:30.752 --> 03:31.794
and generous and cute,

03:31.878 --> 03:33.713
and loyal and cute, and wonderful.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.591
Lucas Mendoza?

03:38.927 --> 03:40.261
-Really?
-Yes.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.348
Yes, so quit calling him names
and give him a chance.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.892
Hey, Gwenny,
you forgot your notebook.

03:45.975 --> 03:50.897
Oh no, I didn't know you were
in the spray zone. Sorry.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.359
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
He's also... kind.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.487
[chuckles] That's what I'm talking about.
Up top!

03:58.279 --> 04:00.657
I don't know what's happening,
but it's fun.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.576
[chuckles] See, Gwenny? He's awesome.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.786
Oh, God...

04:05.495 --> 04:06.371
[laughs]

04:06.621 --> 04:09.958
I think I... made my point.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.340
-Hey, hon.
-Hey, Mom, big news.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.592
Remember how you said
I was too smart to be spending

04:19.717 --> 04:21.594
all my free time in front of screens?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.513
I said a lot of that sentence, yeah.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.767
Well, I found something
that doesn't use a computer,

04:27.850 --> 04:29.435
won't cost you any money,

04:29.519 --> 04:30.979
and I'll get exercise.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.231
I love all of that sentence.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.109
I'm gonna learn how to tap dance!

04:36.567 --> 04:38.278
Cal gave me his old shoes.
[shoes tap]

04:38.403 --> 04:41.322
Jack, that's great! This is gonna be fun.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.199
I just learned this step online.
Check it out!

04:44.784 --> 04:46.452
-Good job!
-Wait, I'm not done.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.542
-That is fanta--
-I'm still not done.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.753
Wow. [giggles]

04:56.921 --> 04:59.215
Look how much sound
your little feet can make.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.554
To conclude our interview, Miss Cooper,

05:04.679 --> 05:06.639
what is your greatest weakness?

05:06.764 --> 05:10.184
I sometimes make coffee too fast
and too delicious.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.437
Katie...

05:12.895 --> 05:14.230
That is the perfect answer.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.776
-I'd totally order a macchiato from you.
-Ooh, what's that?

05:19.527 --> 05:21.112
[audience laughing]

05:21.362 --> 05:22.488
You're gonna do great.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.616
I was just thinking
how I wanted a cupcake!

05:26.326 --> 05:27.660
Am I making things happen?

05:28.119 --> 05:29.162
Am I a witch?

05:30.538 --> 05:31.581
Hey, kids!

05:31.956 --> 05:34.667
-Dylan, my man! What's up?
-Hey.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.381
I don't think we should be doing this.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.466
Word.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.471
Mom, these cupcakes are the best thing
you have ever made.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.598
[chuckles] I didn't make them.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.059
"Gourmet cooking for students.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.727
Lucas Mendoza and..."

05:53.436 --> 05:56.022
No! These were made by...

05:56.272 --> 05:58.066
[ball dribbling nearby]

05:58.316 --> 06:00.485
[Gwenny]
Hashtag #Gwenny! Game over.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.031
You're going to get all weird now,
aren't you?

06:05.114 --> 06:05.948
Yes.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.034
-I'm gonna go.
-Good idea.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.327
[Gwenny giggles]

06:09.827 --> 06:11.162
She's in my house.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.457
Alexa, hi!

06:14.665 --> 06:16.376
Super cute house.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.170
I always assumed you lived in a place
that's smaller,

06:19.253 --> 06:20.797
darker, and covered in bats.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.132
[audience laughing]

06:26.511 --> 06:28.012
That was a lot of fun.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.139
Great jump shot, or should I say...

06:30.515 --> 06:32.934
[both] Pogo!
[both laugh ]

06:33.851 --> 06:34.852
I don't get it.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.813
Why is that funny?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.272
That's not funny.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.191
Inside joke.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.194
[Katie clears throat]

06:43.694 --> 06:45.988
I thought you couldn't stand him.

06:46.280 --> 06:49.200
So did I, but I decided
to give him a chance.

06:49.534 --> 06:53.621
We came here to do our cooking assignment,
took some super cute selfies.

06:53.704 --> 06:57.083
It turns out we both love
the same filters. [chuckles]

06:57.625 --> 07:00.336
Thank you for making me
woke to his charms. [sighs]

07:02.922 --> 07:03.965
What have I done?

07:04.090 --> 07:06.092
[audience laughing]

07:07.510 --> 07:09.887
Did someone rearrange my spice drawer?

07:10.179 --> 07:12.014
I made it a little more intuitive.

07:12.348 --> 07:15.601
It was almost there. It just needed
a little help over the finish line.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.609
-I should get going.
-Oh, darn it. [chuckles]

07:25.361 --> 07:27.155
Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.369
Lucas, what are you doing?
You can't hang out with Gwenny Thompson!

07:33.494 --> 07:35.163
I'll hang out with whomever I want.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.331
It's whomever... Wait, you said it right.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.833
[audience laughing]

07:39.417 --> 07:42.170
Gwenny kept correcting me.
She, like... knows stuff.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.173
-It's pretty cool.
-[shouts] It's not cool!

07:45.840 --> 07:48.551
Sorry! Forgot my stevia.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.971
It's a great way to bake
without all that refined sugar. Bye!

07:52.054 --> 07:54.140
-[Gwenny chuckles]
-Wait up, Gwenny.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.518
Do you, like, wanna hang out after school,
tomorrow?

07:57.768 --> 08:00.062
Like, not for class, but for, like...

08:00.521 --> 08:01.939
-hanging out?
-[Gwenny chuckles]

08:02.023 --> 08:05.359
Most def. [chuckles]
And don't say "like" so much.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.277
Right.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.039
I bake with agave nectar.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.874
I will not be sugar shamed.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.585
It's gonna be okay, babe.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.506
[audience laughing]

08:26.839 --> 08:29.550
How did Gwenny already post
six photos from my house?

08:29.675 --> 08:34.430
"#mendozahang, #thecoolmendoza,
#notalexa"?

08:35.556 --> 08:37.808
[clears throat] This is all my fault.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.310
Don't blame yourself.

08:40.144 --> 08:43.272
I told Gwenny how great Lucas is.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.943
This is all your fault!
Why would you do that?

08:47.026 --> 08:49.237
She was being mean and calling him names!

08:49.320 --> 08:51.614
And I didn't expect her to do that!

08:51.697 --> 08:52.573
[sighs]

08:52.823 --> 08:54.367
Okay, okay.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.202
I can fix this.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.829
You know, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to get to Gwenny.

08:59.038 --> 09:03.042
Yeah, after tomorrow, she will never
want to #mendozahang again! [scoffs]

09:03.334 --> 09:04.794
She won't last ten minutes.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.380
No, let's make it five.
[cracks her knuckles]

09:07.588 --> 09:08.714
[gasps] Ow.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.718
[shoes tapping]

09:14.845 --> 09:17.473
Jack! I have a test tomorrow.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.560
Is there somewhere else you could do that?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.436
I gotta go wherever the dance takes me.

09:26.065 --> 09:26.899
Okay.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.735
Well, I need the dance
to take you outside.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.331
[tapping stops]

09:43.541 --> 09:45.334
[Jack] Sorry, I had to tie my shoe.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.503
[tapping resumes]

09:52.800 --> 09:54.343
Gwenny's going to be here any minute.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.432
It's like watching a dog play the piano.

10:01.726 --> 10:05.062
I think Gwenny's a good influence on him.
Plus these cupcakes.

10:05.229 --> 10:09.150
Enough with the cupcakes already.
Oh, what is the big deal?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.155
Wow, these are fantastic.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.367
What are you guys doing down here?
Gwenny's coming over.

10:18.451 --> 10:22.163
As exciting as that sounds,
the last thing we care about is what

10:22.246 --> 10:23.873
-you and Gwenny Thompson do.
-[knocking]

10:27.877 --> 10:29.086
-Hey, Gwenny.
-Hi, Lucas.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.591
Gwenny, listen, I just have to know
what you put in these cupcakes.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.552
A pinch of freshly ground nutmeg
and amaranth flour.

10:36.802 --> 10:40.097
Wow, you're kidding! It's what I expected.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.144
I realize I may have overstepped
with your spice drawer yesterday.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.980
I'm sorry. I'm a little nutty
when it comes to organization.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.650
Oh. Yeah, that must be hard. [chuckles]

10:52.360 --> 10:55.488
I will say, your cookie sheet drawer...
perfection.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.991
Oh, well, I don't know about perfection.
Really?

10:59.408 --> 11:00.993
Oh. Thank you! [chuckles]

11:04.038 --> 11:05.873
[moking her] You like her.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.250
I do! [chuckles]

11:08.334 --> 11:10.878
But she's a controlling perfectionist
know-it-all.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.631
I have no idea what I see in her.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.427
That's an unsolvable mystery.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.807
[Lucas giggles]
Check this out. We have bunny ears.

11:22.890 --> 11:23.933
We look so cute. [giggles]

11:24.016 --> 11:26.686
[Katie snickers] Let's do this.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.731
This is a selfie of me at the zoo.

11:30.815 --> 11:34.360
Oh! Sorry, just having a little snack.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.612
-Is that--
-Guacamole?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.698
Oh, yeah.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.784
I hate guacamole.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.910
It makes me gag.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.787
That's right!

11:45.037 --> 11:48.582
I completely forgot you threw up
on Taco Day in the third grade.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.668
[both giggling]

11:50.793 --> 11:53.379
Just ignore her.
This is one of me in the mirror.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.965
[shoes tapping]

12:01.971 --> 12:04.056
Dude, I have a guest over.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.474
Oh, but Katie told me--

12:05.558 --> 12:09.353
I told him you didn't want to hurt
his feelings by telling him...

12:09.645 --> 12:11.856
you didn't want to see him dance?

12:13.482 --> 12:16.402
Oh! I can tell him.
I don't mind hurting kids' feelings.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.821
[Katie sighs]

12:20.281 --> 12:21.240
Mmm.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.951
Kyle calls this stuff elephant snot.

12:24.243 --> 12:28.080
Ugh! I'm out of here. Enjoy your gua...
[gags]

12:28.247 --> 12:30.040
[Gwenny clears throat then pants]

12:30.124 --> 12:32.334
Guac...
[gags then pants]

12:32.418 --> 12:33.878
I need some fresh air.

12:34.295 --> 12:37.339
Wait, I'll come with you.
We can walk through the park.

12:37.631 --> 12:38.841
That sounds nice.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.885
It's kind of cold out.
Wear my sweatshirt.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.642
Thanks.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.479
The sun will be setting. You know
what they say about sunset selfies?

12:51.562 --> 12:53.773
It's the most flattering light!

12:56.817 --> 12:57.943
What just happened?

13:00.321 --> 13:01.447
You made it bad,

13:02.031 --> 13:03.115
but I made it worse.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.533
Okay, we've gotta stop her.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.660
Because first, it starts with cupcakes
and basketball.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.330
Now, it's sunset selfies, and before
you know, they'll be married.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.831
Married?

13:11.248 --> 13:12.541
She's out of control.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.918
She's the worst.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.085
I like her.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.296
[audience laughing]

13:22.968 --> 13:24.970
[shoes tapping]

13:27.848 --> 13:30.059
Jack, I got a surprise for you.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.143
Hmm!

13:31.227 --> 13:32.978
I stopped on my way home from work

13:33.062 --> 13:35.064
and rented that new video game
you've been wanting.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.941
You said that was too scary for me.

13:37.733 --> 13:38.692
That was last week.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.695
Live in the now, man.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.906
[Jennnifer chuckles]

13:43.989 --> 13:45.407
We only have it for a day.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.868
So better get to chopping off heads.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.081
Maybe later.
I'm trying to master this new step.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.959
[shoes tapping]

13:57.044 --> 13:58.796
Okay, Jack?

13:59.922 --> 14:01.465
Jack? [shouts] Jack!

14:03.509 --> 14:05.344
Come over here. We need to talk.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.137
[takes a deep breath]

14:08.514 --> 14:12.226
Honey, I love that you've found
a new interest,

14:12.351 --> 14:16.272
but I just can't have you dancing
around the house all the time.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.567
You need to find something quieter
to enjoy.

14:20.776 --> 14:24.655
Ooh, like doing a puzzle of a dancer.

14:26.907 --> 14:27.741
Okay.

14:29.493 --> 14:30.786
[shoes tapping]

14:30.953 --> 14:32.413
Jack, wait.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.332
Bring me the shoes.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.793
[audience laughing]

14:42.631 --> 14:46.010
I've tried everything in my arsenal
to drive Lucas and Gwenny apart.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.053
But they've hung out every day this week.

14:48.178 --> 14:52.099
-We've hung out every day this week.
-But you guys are adorable and fun.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.767
They're upsetting and barfy.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.023
Okay, eventually the excitement
will wear off, and Lucas will move on.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.858
It's like that time he got that
green hoodie.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.776
He wore it every day for a month.

15:02.860 --> 15:06.155
And one day, he left it in the woods,
and a raccoon had her babies on it.

15:06.238 --> 15:11.201
So, we should drop Gwenny in the woods
and let nature take its course?

15:11.285 --> 15:13.287
[audience laughing]

15:14.788 --> 15:17.833
Please, tell me you guys are hanging out
just to annoy me.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.670
I actually like Lucas.
Annoying you is just a bonus. [chuckles]

15:21.754 --> 15:22.922
See you tonight.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.590
-Tonight?
-Yup.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.843
We're going on our first date.
Oh, sorry...

15:27.968 --> 15:29.428
Hashtag #firstdate.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.514
Oh, come on!

15:32.932 --> 15:34.725
I just got so tired!

15:37.186 --> 15:40.314
All right. We've tried to sabotage them
the old-fashioned way.

15:40.397 --> 15:44.068
-It's time to kick it up a notch.
-Mmm, I love everything you're saying.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.319
How do we do it?

15:46.195 --> 15:48.948
Okay, I feel like you missed the point
of the green hoodie story.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.910
We are going to give them
the worst date advice.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.954
But Gwenny will never take
bad advice from us.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.623
She'd just do the exact opposite
of what we say.

15:58.874 --> 16:03.170
Oh, so we give her good advice,
and she'll do the exact opposite.

16:03.295 --> 16:06.882
Reverse psychology date sabotaged!

16:08.342 --> 16:12.096
Gwen and I have been at this for years.
She'll anticipate reverse psychology.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.517
Which is why we're going to use
reverse reverse psychology.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.435
I'll give Gwenny bad advice.

16:18.519 --> 16:22.314
She'll assume I'm hoping she'll do the
exact opposite, and do exactly what I say.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.441
-Perfect.
-What?

16:25.859 --> 16:27.027
Or...

16:27.111 --> 16:29.446
just stop meddling in their business.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.574
It'll fizzle out,
and we can have our own date.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.618
That's really sweet.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.079
No. We're doing this.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.165
If anyone asks...
[whispers] ...you never heard anything.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.545
Yeah, you end a lot of our conversations
that way!

16:49.675 --> 16:51.260
Gwenny, hi.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.804
If you're here to talk me out
of going to dinner with Lucas,

16:53.887 --> 16:55.347
you're wasting your time.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.808
I've already picked out the accessories
for my outfit,

16:57.891 --> 16:59.143
and they sparkle.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.561
They sparkle hard.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.106
No. I've accepted it.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.817
But if you're going to be seeing Lucas,
I might as well help you.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.861
You want to help me?

17:08.944 --> 17:09.987
-Really?
-Really.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.531
Really? Advice would be great.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.324
And don't mention his hair.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.285
Never talk about it.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.953
Even if he brings it up.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.372
So don't open doors
or pull out the chair for her.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.417
Never. But she does love
when you order for her.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.669
So don't even let her touch the menu.

17:25.753 --> 17:29.673
The only thing he loves more than books,
is talking about books.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.301
And she doesn't hear well
in crowded places,

17:32.384 --> 17:35.179
so be sure to talk loudly.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.682
He's always making jokes,
but no one ever realizes it.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.018
So laugh. A lot.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.645
So laugh. A lot.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.774
Wow. That is so helpful. Thanks.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.569
Wow. That is so helpful. Thanks.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.655
As if I'd fall for that.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.325
She thinks I'll do the opposite
of everything she said.

17:56.408 --> 18:00.370
So I'm going to do the opposite
of the opposite of what she said.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.998
[snickers] She's so basic.

18:05.959 --> 18:09.463
This relationship's going to be over
before they order dessert. [sighs]

18:09.588 --> 18:12.049
Let's make it appetizers.
[cracks her knuckles then gasps]

18:12.132 --> 18:13.383
Ow.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.970
Gwenny's been at the house all week.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.056
I think Lucas really likes her.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.892
She's so organized,
and she corrects everybody,

18:21.975 --> 18:23.185
and she's a great cook.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.437
Sounds like somebody
I went to high school with.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.689
You're right.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.650
She's totally Debbie Williams.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.735
[audience laughing]

18:32.528 --> 18:34.655
Found this bag of heads. Awesome.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.366
What's going on over there?

18:37.658 --> 18:39.910
I just couldn't take the noise anymore.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.913
I think I broke him.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.165
My tiny dancer.

18:47.084 --> 18:47.960
[sighs]

18:49.419 --> 18:51.171
Can't believe I'm about to do this.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.590
Jack?

18:54.174 --> 18:56.426
Honey, you don't have to play
that video game.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.512
You can tap dance.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.180
Said no parent ever.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.684
-Really?
-Your shoes are in the closet.

19:05.102 --> 19:09.189
They're behind the vacuum,
under the winter coats, in a box.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.024
Labeled "Goodwill."

19:12.818 --> 19:13.986
You're a good mom.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.988
I'm about to be an insane mom.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.657
I have no idea how I'm going to deal
with the noise.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.243
I may have a solution.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.246
[shoes tapping]

19:29.626 --> 19:31.295
This is amazing!

19:31.712 --> 19:34.131
Tell Dave to thank his friends
at the airport!

19:34.214 --> 19:37.092
Oh, I'm so glad you noticed!
I just got it cut!

19:37.467 --> 19:40.429
Oh, it's not new!
I just haven't worn it in a while.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.389
I've missed this!

19:42.472 --> 19:43.473
Merlot!

19:51.732 --> 19:53.734
[Gwenny pants, chuckles]

19:55.944 --> 19:58.739
I guess I can manage,
like I did with the car door,

19:59.031 --> 20:00.866
and the restaurant door. [chuckles]

20:02.743 --> 20:04.203
I like your outfit.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.330
Thanks for sending me a photo of it first.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.457
Thanks for approving it.
[chuckles]

20:09.374 --> 20:12.419
Oh, no, you don't! That's my job.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.421
-[Gwenny giggles]
-[Lucas chuckles]

20:20.302 --> 20:24.264
I'm so glad we're here to witness this.
We're like conductors in a symphony.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.433
Breakup in G minor.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.518
[audience laughing]

20:30.354 --> 20:32.356
Have we made any decisions yet?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.191
Um, yes!

20:34.274 --> 20:36.318
Could I please have...

20:36.818 --> 20:38.528
some more free bread?

20:42.115 --> 20:44.409
-You look great tonight.
-Thanks.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.577
So do you.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.038
And your hair... Never mind.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.289
What about my hair?

20:49.373 --> 20:51.333
Let's change the subject.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.126
Read anything interesting lately?

20:53.961 --> 20:54.962
Uh...

20:55.254 --> 20:57.172
The "Please Wait To Be Seated" sign?

20:57.756 --> 21:00.467
What? Oh, you're being funny!

21:00.676 --> 21:02.678
[chortles]

21:03.637 --> 21:06.348
Seriously, though.
What book are you reading right now?

21:07.015 --> 21:07.849
Huh?

21:08.850 --> 21:11.311
[cackles]

21:11.687 --> 21:13.063
You're the funny one.

21:13.855 --> 21:15.732
I don't know why people
don't laugh at you more.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.402
-What?
-Oh, right!

21:18.485 --> 21:23.365
[yelling] I don't know why people
don't laugh at you more!

21:24.491 --> 21:26.493
[Alexa and Katie laughing]

21:26.743 --> 21:30.038
My manager says you have to order
something to get more bread.

21:30.872 --> 21:31.748
Okay.

21:32.040 --> 21:35.585
What do you recommend
that is under three dollars?

21:35.752 --> 21:38.171
The vending machine at the gas station?

21:40.674 --> 21:43.343
[yelling] I'm not reading any books!

21:44.803 --> 21:48.181
-Why are you yelling at me?
-Why aren't you talking about my hair?

21:48.265 --> 21:51.184
Because Alexa told me not to,
and that you love books

21:51.268 --> 21:52.519
and a bunch of other stuff.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.813
[yelling] Katie told me to laugh a lot,

21:54.896 --> 21:57.399
and you can't hear well...
Ohhhh...

21:59.026 --> 22:01.987
I should have known.
Alexa conspired against us.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.489
She used reverse reverse psychology on me.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.908
Katie used psychology on me!

22:07.534 --> 22:09.453
They thought they could ruin us.

22:10.245 --> 22:11.121
[Gwenny gasps]

22:11.204 --> 22:12.122
They're here!

22:13.582 --> 22:15.000
They don't know we saw them.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.502
-Want to get even?
-Always.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.880
She wants to see us fighting, so...

22:19.963 --> 22:22.174
Let's show her
we're having the best date ever.

22:23.842 --> 22:28.013
-What did we miss? I can't hear them.
-Why are they smiling?

22:28.096 --> 22:30.682
[chuckles] This is the best date ever.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.518
You have really pretty eyes.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.607
-Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew.
-Ugh.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.319
-Another breadstick?
-I'd love one.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.449
[both laughing]

22:47.532 --> 22:49.826
Oh, I can't breathe.
[inhales deeply]

22:49.910 --> 22:52.079
Am I sinking into the floor?

22:52.913 --> 22:54.873
You really do have pretty eyes.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.958
Your hair looks beautiful tonight.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.544
-That means a lot.
-[Gwenny chuckles]

23:01.004 --> 23:02.798
You know what would make Alexa really mad?

23:03.173 --> 23:04.549
Way ahead of you.

23:05.050 --> 23:05.926
No!

23:06.134 --> 23:09.221
Stop! This isn't happening!
Shut it down!

23:09.304 --> 23:10.472
Health code violation!

23:10.555 --> 23:13.392
And I think you've had enough breadsticks!

23:14.476 --> 23:16.478
[Alexa pants]

23:16.561 --> 23:17.729
What are you doing?

23:17.813 --> 23:19.272
You guys were just fighting.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.817
Your little sabotage worked for a minute.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.236
But now I like Gwenny more than ever.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.612
She's pretty dope.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.823
[chuckles] Whatever! You're the dope one.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.033
Let me just be clear. [inhales]

23:30.117 --> 23:33.537
All the butting in and meddling we did
to keep you guys apart

23:33.620 --> 23:35.122
has only driven you closer together?

23:35.455 --> 23:36.832
-Pretty much.
-Thanks.

23:37.332 --> 23:41.128
And I already came up with our
couples name. Hashtag #Gwencas.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.546
And I'm posting it.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.047
[both] No!

23:44.339 --> 23:45.715
[waitress clears throat]

23:47.217 --> 23:48.385
We know, we're leaving.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.971
Thank you. You've been super fun.

23:51.096 --> 23:54.307
Definitely let me know where you work,
so I can stop by sometime.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.395
I don't have anywhere to work yet.
I'm trying to get a job.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.523
Oh, no, I'm trying to get a job.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.774
My interview!

24:04.901 --> 24:06.319
Just so you know,

24:06.403 --> 24:09.573
I left my wallet at home
because Katie said you love to pay.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.867
[audience laughing]

24:16.037 --> 24:17.581
Too late.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.708
I am so sorry.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.543
There's no excuse.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.712
Please just give me another chance.

24:24.129 --> 24:24.963
No.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.884
[grunts] Ugh. I blew it.

24:30.218 --> 24:33.513
No, this is not how this day ends.
I'm saying something.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.808
Didn't we just learn that meddling
only makes things worse?

24:37.267 --> 24:38.226
You're right.

24:38.894 --> 24:39.936
But I can't help myself.

24:41.646 --> 24:42.564
Hey,

24:42.731 --> 24:46.276
you've got to give Katie a chance.
She deserves her interview.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.487
Isn't this the face you want
welcoming people here?

24:48.570 --> 24:49.821
I mean, Katie,

24:49.905 --> 24:51.198
say welcome to Wired.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.285
-We... welcome to Wired.
-[Alexa gasps then sighs]

24:55.952 --> 24:59.247
See? That's the most welcome
I've ever felt.

25:00.248 --> 25:03.293
And you don't even know
how she makes her coffee.

25:03.418 --> 25:07.839
-Katie, how do you make your coffee?
-Too fast and too delicious!

25:08.924 --> 25:12.135
Wow, I want someone like that
making my coffee.

25:12.219 --> 25:15.013
If I give her the job,
will you please stop talking?

25:16.306 --> 25:17.307
You start next week.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.768
-[Alexa and Katie scream]
-Whoa! Don't do that.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.145
Thank you so much.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.899
I... cannot believe that worked!

25:26.149 --> 25:29.694
So, meddling doesn't always
make things worse?

25:29.778 --> 25:31.988
Exactly. That's what we learned today.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.949
We should always meddle,

25:34.407 --> 25:36.076
except for when we shouldn't.

25:36.159 --> 25:38.203
Either way, I have a job.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.581
Which means I'll be able
to pay to go to London...

25:41.831 --> 25:45.418
and you are getting all
the free mochas you want.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.128
[Barry] No free mochas!

25:47.796 --> 25:49.756
Right! Got it.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.258
[Barry] Nope.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.586
