Previously on E.R.:

00:07.441 --> 00:09.443
LOCKHART:
You're going,
right?

00:09.477 --> 00:10.578
To Africa?

00:10.611 --> 00:13.414
It's not Rio.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.649
But it's not here.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.320
Bonjour.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.488
Bonjour.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.091
( romantic pop music playing )

00:23.124 --> 00:25.093
* Wait for me

00:27.428 --> 00:30.264
* And wait for me...

00:30.298 --> 00:32.800
( explosion, screams )

00:34.235 --> 00:35.203
( speaking French )

00:35.236 --> 00:36.270
Get down!

00:36.304 --> 00:38.239
Je vous en prie!
Ne tirez pas!

00:41.475 --> 00:43.744
...du gouvernement.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.114
Don't do anything stupid.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.448
Like what?

00:47.481 --> 00:50.151
Like get yourself killed.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

02:40.728 --> 02:42.563
Hi.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.236
Hi.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.474
When did you get back?

02:53.507 --> 02:54.875
Just now.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.551
It's 5:30
in the morning.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.288
My flight from London
was delayed.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.264
I missed you.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.270
Did you just let yourself in?

03:26.840 --> 03:29.277
I'm sorry about how I left.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.787
Can I have my key back, please?

03:56.370 --> 03:57.538
( keys jangling )

04:06.947 --> 04:08.616
( keys clanking )

04:08.649 --> 04:10.318
( door slams )

04:13.086 --> 04:14.522
Sorry we're late.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.823
I couldn't get
Hannah going.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.392
Same with
Katie this morning.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.627
I don't want to sit
in the middle.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.661
In the car, please.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.363
I sat in the
middle yesterday.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.697
Hannah, will you sit in the
middle this morning?

04:23.731 --> 04:24.998
Move over,
Matthew.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.600
Can we trade days next week?
Steve has to go

04:26.634 --> 04:28.068
to Seattle, and I don't
have anybody

04:28.101 --> 04:29.337
to sit with Devon.
Sure. Can you call
and remind me

04:29.370 --> 04:30.938
over the weekend?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.506
Thank you, Hannah.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.974
Bye, Matthew.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.343
Sorry you got stuck
with that

04:35.343 --> 04:36.344
Art Institute field trip.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.479
Luck of the draw.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.813
( kissing sound )

04:56.864 --> 04:59.367
( kids laughing )

05:02.403 --> 05:04.037
Hey, Beth, it's me.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.874
What do I have at 3:00?

05:06.907 --> 05:11.379
Can we cancel Howard
or move him till later?

05:11.379 --> 05:12.680
Crap!

05:12.713 --> 05:13.781
No, not you.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.048
Traffic.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.984
I'll have to call
you back, Beth.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.786
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.054
Excuse me. I'm sorry, ladies.
I'm late for work.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.665
( sighs )

05:31.699 --> 05:33.601
Just made it, you know.

05:40.107 --> 05:44.678
If I'm late again,
my boss is going to kill me.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.013
You're a doctor?

05:46.046 --> 05:48.749
Yeah.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.751
Yes, I am.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.459
Where are we, Mommy?

05:58.492 --> 05:59.793
( phone ringing )

05:59.827 --> 06:02.663
We're almost
there, sweetie.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.435
Denise Johnson.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.638
No, Beth, I'm still stuck.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.506
I'm taking...

06:12.540 --> 06:13.507
Mom?

06:13.541 --> 06:14.508
Mom!

06:14.542 --> 06:16.444
Look out!

06:16.477 --> 06:18.111
Mom, look out!
( screaming )

07:28.081 --> 07:29.149
PRATT:
Yes, it can be challenging,

07:29.182 --> 07:31.151
and at times
it is dangerous,

07:31.184 --> 07:32.620
but it's very rewarding.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.555
You know, you get
to make money

07:34.588 --> 07:36.857
and be an asset
to your community and...

07:37.958 --> 07:39.527
Now what?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.128
( over PA ):
Attention passengers,

07:41.161 --> 07:43.230
due to a delay ahead of us,
we are unable to proceed.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.533
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.000
Thank you for your patience.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.882
LOCKHART:
Thank you.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.684
Says he'll have them out
in a few minutes.

08:03.717 --> 08:04.818
WEAVER:
How many?
Four.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.687
A mother and three kids.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.889
And there's another guy trapped
under a car across the street.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.924
MARQUEZ:
Six-victim MVA.
Great way to start a shift.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.793
MALIK:
Yeah, I was supposed
to have today off, too.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.127
Aren't you graduating soon?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.162
Yesterday.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.697
Congratulations.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.031
You know what they call
the guy that graduates

08:18.065 --> 08:19.667
last in his class
from medical school, right?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.001
That joke is so tired.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.570
Doctor.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.072
Ha, ha.
I graduated fourth
in my class.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.974
When is this supposed
to be finished?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.642
Weaver said they'd be done
last week.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.911
So they should be done by what,
Thanksgiving?

08:30.944 --> 08:33.179
So why don't they just shut us
down during all this?

08:33.212 --> 08:35.015
Oh, please.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.684
That would make
way too much sense.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.719
( electrical crackling )
Hey.

08:38.751 --> 08:39.720
Hey!

08:39.753 --> 08:40.921
( screams ):
Hey!

08:40.953 --> 08:43.323
Is that absolutely
necessary?!

08:43.356 --> 08:45.158
Does anyone know
where Susan is?

08:45.192 --> 08:46.727
We're going to need
extra hands.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.895
Think she's in
the handicapped head.

08:47.928 --> 08:48.962
Again?

08:48.996 --> 08:50.263
We're out of copier paper.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.298
I'm not Department
Chair anymore.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.700
Tell Dr. Lewis.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.034
We're over our
monthly allocation

08:54.067 --> 08:55.736
and the Chief
of Staff's office

08:55.769 --> 08:58.706
refuses to authorize
any additional overages.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.040
That's you, right?
( electric crackling )

09:00.073 --> 09:01.041
Excuse me.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.042
Are you deaf?

09:02.075 --> 09:03.611
I said stop!

09:03.611 --> 09:04.912
Excuse me,
can you help me, sir?

09:04.945 --> 09:06.914
You need to find a triage nurse.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.315
No, I'm sorry.
I work here.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.950
Lucky you.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.119
I'm supposed
to start today.
Neela Rasgotra?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.721
Rag what?

09:13.754 --> 09:14.888
Rasgotra.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.990
Don't we hire
Americans anymore?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.258
Hey!

09:18.291 --> 09:19.627
( screams ):
Hey!

09:19.660 --> 09:22.062
I'm talking to you!

09:23.163 --> 09:24.364
Dr. Lewis in there?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.766
Oh, yeah.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.735
Susan.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.203
Yeah?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.338
Uh, see you later.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.907
Yeah. Uh, you
know what, maybe.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.275
Um, I don't know.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.246
Fire's almost
got the MVAs out.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.214
Three adults,
three kids.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.916
I thought you
were divorced.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.085
We are.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.086
Carter's back.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.187
Yeah?

09:47.220 --> 09:48.756
He tried to apologize.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.090
No, no.
Did he screw it up?

09:50.123 --> 09:51.659
You said Friday.
Why do they even bother?

09:51.659 --> 09:53.661
I said maybe.
Didn't say for sure.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.263
Dr. Lewis, you got another TWA.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.297
LEWIS:
Oh, hi,
I'm Susan Lewis.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.866
Are you a resident?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.200
Neela Rasgotra.
Third year medical student.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.835
That's a nice outfit.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.070
You may want to wear
something different
next time.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.137
It gets kind of
messy down here.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.973
You can put your
stuff down here.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.140
Where's the ceiling, huh?
Where are the doors? The glass?

10:07.174 --> 10:08.408
Is this
your first rotation?
Yeah.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.843
The tile?
Look, we usually
wait until...

10:09.877 --> 10:11.845
No, no! I don't
want you to wait.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.947
I want you to take
what you have and
do it now, finish it.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.382
Have you ever been
in a trauma before?

10:15.415 --> 10:16.717
No.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.118
32-year-old restrained driver

10:18.151 --> 10:20.420
in a high-speed rollover
with PSI.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.756
No LOC, complains of
hip and low back pain.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.258
Pulse 120, B.P. 130/82.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.393
Okay, Neela, hang close.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.728
WOMAN:
The kids...

10:27.761 --> 10:29.296
Please help the kids.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.864
Eight-year-old female.
Bilateral femur fractures,

10:30.898 --> 10:32.299
head trauma with
altered mental status.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.067
B.P. 90/60, resps 24.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.703
CHEN:
What happened?

10:35.736 --> 10:36.904
Her legs were crushed
between the truck and the seat.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.238
Took CFD a long time
to cut her out.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.940
How many more incoming?
Three.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.141
Any other attendings?
No.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.175
You a doctor yet?

10:42.209 --> 10:43.243
I graduated yesterday.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.311
Good enough.
Where's Pratt?

10:44.344 --> 10:45.345
Don't know.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.880
Frank, where's Dr. Pratt?

10:46.914 --> 10:48.215
How should I know?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.183
Okay, Jerry, I want you
to start paging Pratt

10:50.217 --> 10:54.321
and don't stop paging him
until he calls back.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.355
My computer
just went down.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.890
Whoa,
they're all down.

10:56.924 --> 10:59.693
Son of a bitch!

11:00.728 --> 11:03.130
Oh, for God's sake.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.065
( Pratt gasping )

11:05.098 --> 11:06.734
Oh, man.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.342
Oh, no, I'm a doctor here.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.811
All right.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.980
Hey! How was Africa?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.882
Hot.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.116
( pager beeps )

11:23.150 --> 11:25.318
That's your pager going off.
Yeah.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.154
Going to answer it?
Nope.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.156
I'll catch up with you later.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.026
Matthew, back middle passenger
wearing a lap belt.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.929
Scalp lac from the dome light,
closed left wrist fracture.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.367
WEAVER:
Doctor, you're late.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.902
I was outside helping
the paramedics.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.236
You were supposed
to be here at 8:00,

11:43.270 --> 11:46.139
not five after
or ten after or 20 after.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.077
( electrical sizzling )

11:59.019 --> 12:00.287
Hey, Frank.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.822
Where's the lounge?

12:01.855 --> 12:03.290
Down by X-ray.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.360
Morning.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.429
You bring Kovac back with you?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.031
Nope.

12:52.906 --> 12:53.573
( strained ):
Where's my mom?

12:53.606 --> 12:54.842
Can you call my mom?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.076
Hey, how you doing, Matthew?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.244
I'm Dr. Gallant.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.545
Good vitals.
A and O times four.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.080
Doctor?
When did that happen?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.148
About 20 minutes ago.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.249
Where does it hurt?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.084
( groans ):
My arm.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.853
Can you push my hands
with your feet?

13:05.853 --> 13:07.254
( Matthew grunting )

13:09.389 --> 13:12.192
Who's in there
with Dr. Lewis?

13:12.225 --> 13:13.360
New med student, I think.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.599
Yeah, his belly is tender.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.234
( groans )
But soft.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.870
It's probably just bruised.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.972
Get abdominal CT
and a wrist series.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.474
I'll be next door,
if you need me.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.878
Hey.

13:30.878 --> 13:31.879
You need some help?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.246
LEWIS:
Sure.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.250
Trauma panel includes CBC,
Chem-7, LFTs, amylase,

13:37.284 --> 13:41.354
PT/PTT, urine toxicology
screen and a BAL.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.890
I'm Dr. Greg Pratt.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.024
Neela Rasgotra.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.392
WOMAN:
I don't know what happened.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.896
I was driving,
then we were upside down.

13:48.896 --> 13:49.930
"Neela," that's
Indian, right?

13:49.963 --> 13:51.198
Mm, yeah.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.033
WOMAN:
My daughter,
is she okay?

13:53.066 --> 13:54.267
Please?

13:54.301 --> 13:56.103
We need to make sure
you're fine first.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.106
Pupils four millimeters equal
and reactive bilaterally.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.108
Sinus tach, hemocue is 8.1.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.976
8.1, that's
pretty low.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.978
Yeah, we have to
find the source
of the blood loss.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.246
PRATT:
Could be hemothorax,

14:06.279 --> 14:07.280
bleeding in the chest.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.281
Chest is clear.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.416
Or it could be

14:09.449 --> 14:10.483
intra-abdominal
hemorrhage.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.519
Belly is soft and nontender.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.087
Or it could be
something else.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.588
( woman gasps )

14:15.622 --> 14:17.290
( gasping )

14:17.324 --> 14:20.493
Like a unstable pelvic
fracture, Professor Pratt?

14:20.527 --> 14:23.063
( loud hammering )

14:29.469 --> 14:33.040
Hey. An attorney called
every day while you were gone.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.275
Said he was the executor
of your grandmother's estate,

14:35.308 --> 14:37.210
needs to talk to you.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.346
Call him back, would you?

14:39.379 --> 14:42.182
I am not your
personal assistant.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.184
OLIGARIO:
Hey. Welcome back, Carter.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.618
Yeah, you, too.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.356
( paper crinkling )

14:54.962 --> 14:56.063
What do you have?

14:56.096 --> 14:57.564
Pelvic fracture
with a low crit.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.665
How was Africa?

14:58.698 --> 15:01.034
It was... great.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.002
She hypotensive?

15:02.035 --> 15:03.971
No, pressure's holding.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.106
But there's a little girl
next door may need some help.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.374
Is that Hannah?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.509
Is she okay?

15:12.345 --> 15:13.513
Need a hand?

15:13.546 --> 15:15.983
CHEN:
Welcome home, stranger.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.584
Open your eyes, Hannah.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.485
( groans )

15:18.518 --> 15:20.553
Responds to pain.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.322
Hannah?

15:22.355 --> 15:24.124
( groans )

15:24.157 --> 15:25.558
When did
you get back?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.194
Last night, late.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.029
JERRY:
They pulled another kid out.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.197
I'll take the new one.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.698
Let you two catch up.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.001
She's altered.
Right parietal hematoma.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.502
I'd call for a head CT.

15:35.535 --> 15:39.406
Crush injury, bilateral femur
fractures with good pulses.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.740
She needs
Hare traction.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.143
She broke both her legs.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.211
So, put on two.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.678
Not room for two.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.280
Are we arguing?

15:47.314 --> 15:48.748
I just don't want to adduct
her legs.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.517
She needs traction.
Well, we can

15:50.550 --> 15:54.021
rig a Sager in the middle,
with a double harness bar.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.655
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

15:57.024 --> 15:58.325
Morison's pouch
is between

15:58.358 --> 16:00.727
the liver and
the right kidney.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.695
Any liquid blood
appears anechoic

16:02.729 --> 16:04.331
between the
two organs.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.765
Big black
stripe, right?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.067
That's right.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.101
Can I steal
a nurse, Susan?

16:08.135 --> 16:09.402
Yeah, sure.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.737
Central line's in.
Hook up the infuser.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.173
Dr. Chen, this is Neela,
our new medical student.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.174
Hi.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.375
Nice to meet you.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.643
Okay.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.046
Uh... no blood
visualized.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.480
Moving to the left
upper quadrant

16:20.513 --> 16:22.115
to view
the subdiaphragmatic space.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.316
Malik,
can you join me?

16:23.350 --> 16:24.384
Yeah.
Thank you.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.321
The transverse
suprapubic scan

16:28.355 --> 16:30.390
looks for blood
anterior to the bladder.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.658
I'm stealing your aprons.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.326
Okay, go ahead.

16:37.264 --> 16:40.633
I found your present
hanging on my locker.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.769
It was subtle.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.504
It was very subtle.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.705
TECH:
All clear.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.340
MARQUEZ:
Hemocue seven
point nine.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.675
LEWIS:
Bring me the films
when they're done.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.243
How's her pressure?
110 over 78.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.578
If she's anemic
and losing blood,

16:51.611 --> 16:52.712
why doesn't she drop
her pressure?

16:52.745 --> 16:54.747
She's young and healthy.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.217
Ma'am, we're going
to stabilize your
pelvic fracture.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.585
I need you to keep
traction. Come on.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.387
Okay, this is going
to hurt some, Denise.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.389
I'm going to go check
on your daughter, all right?

17:02.422 --> 17:04.757
Keep two of O-neg
on the rapid infuser,
just in case.

17:04.790 --> 17:05.825
Be back.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.096
( panting )

17:14.101 --> 17:15.102
LEWIS:
Need a pedes vent?

17:15.102 --> 17:16.236
CHEN:
Called for it.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.237
At least five
rib fractures

17:17.270 --> 17:18.471
with a flail segment.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.806
Prep for a 28
French chest tube.

17:19.839 --> 17:20.839
All right,
I'll get you some help.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.175
Hey, Gallant, how you doing?

17:22.209 --> 17:25.412
Fine.
You want to run it?

17:25.444 --> 17:26.779
Yeah, eight-year-old boy.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.115
Middle rear seat
passenger.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.216
Scalp lac,
left wrist fracture.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.450
Seat-belt sign.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.119
Rule out
an interperitoneal injury.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.220
Okay.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.155
Hey, unilateral
open book fracture.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.323
She drop her BP yet?

17:36.356 --> 17:37.590
Well, she's a trooper.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.126
Okay, I'll call upstairs.
Go next door.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.327
Jing-Mei needs some help.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.794
Hey, Frank, can
you call Angio,

17:41.828 --> 17:44.631
and tell them to
reserve a room
for my pelvis?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.366
CHEN:
Where's the Thoraseal?

17:46.399 --> 17:47.700
I only got two hands.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.835
I can pitch in.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.638
Good.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.240
You sure you can
tear yourself away

17:53.273 --> 17:54.841
from your med student
for a moment?

17:54.874 --> 17:56.776
She's doing fine.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.312
Oh-silk?

18:00.680 --> 18:02.582
Are they together?

18:02.615 --> 18:03.683
MARQUEZ:
Who?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.185
Them.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.688
Oh, yeah.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.692
My hands
are starting to cramp.

18:12.725 --> 18:16.396
Well, I'll go get
those towel clips.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.304
I don't know
what happened.

18:24.337 --> 18:28.641
I was driving,
and then we were upside down.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.809
And the truck hit us.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.612
( shuddering )

18:32.645 --> 18:35.182
How are Matthew
and Katie?

18:35.182 --> 18:36.449
I don't know.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.518
Has someone
called their
parents?

18:38.551 --> 18:42.655
Lizzie and Steve are Katie's.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.924
Matthew's dad is Andy.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.193
Oh, God.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.195
( shudders )

18:50.730 --> 18:52.599
Is that one
of the girls
next door?

18:56.203 --> 18:57.870
Is that Hannah?

18:58.705 --> 19:00.340
Oh, God, Hannah!

19:00.373 --> 19:01.674
Please, please...

19:01.708 --> 19:07.847
( sobbing ):
Be okay,
please...

19:07.880 --> 19:09.382
Is that Hannah?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.218
PVCs.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.752
What's her pulse ox?
Run of four.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.254
All right, 30 of lidocaine.
Let's crank up the O2.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.722
You think her T waves
look peaked?

19:15.755 --> 19:16.789
No, no, it's too early
for hyperkalemia.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.225
Carter, they look
peaked to me.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.293
Just push the
damn lidocaine.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.628
V tach.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.695
Lost the pulse.
Starting compressions.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.264
Charge it to 30.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.465
DENISE:
What are
they doing?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.466
What's happening?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.301
I can't tell from here.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.469
Is something wrong?

19:29.502 --> 19:32.539
Please, ma'am,
don't move.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.309
Denise?

19:36.343 --> 19:38.245
Mrs. Johnson?

19:39.246 --> 19:41.614
I need some help in here.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.283
Hey!

19:43.316 --> 19:44.951
Hey!

19:47.520 --> 19:48.655
What's going on
in here?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.257
Pelvic fracture
with anemia.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.491
Just dropped
her pressure.
Who are you?

19:51.524 --> 19:52.959
Medical student.
Who's her doctor?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.761
I'm stabilizing her fracture.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.396
Yeah, while she bleeds out.
Are you from the East End?

19:56.429 --> 19:57.630
No, West London.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.898
MARQUEZ:
What happened?

19:58.931 --> 20:01.501
Chuny, I want
a second line,
wide open.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.236
How much O-neg
has she had?

20:03.270 --> 20:04.371
None. She was stable.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.438
Well, now,
her pressure

20:05.472 --> 20:07.307
is 60 over 40.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.975
Did anyone bother
ultrasounding the belly?

20:09.008 --> 20:10.243
Negative for blood.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.578
What about chest X-ray?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.880
All clear.
Pressure's up to
80 systolic.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.383
Okay, I want a second line in,
prep for a DPL.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.717
What's her CBC?

20:17.750 --> 20:18.751
PRATT:
It's not back yet.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.553
You! Go pick up her labs.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.588
Right now?

20:21.621 --> 20:23.790
No, next Thursday.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.426
B level,
Specimen Processing.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.827
Take the elevator
in the lobby. Go!

20:27.860 --> 20:29.396
CORDAY:
Prep for an IJ.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.264
I'll do a mini-lap
for the DPL.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.600
Excuse me? The elevators?

20:37.304 --> 20:38.571
CARTER:
And clear!

20:38.605 --> 20:39.772
ABBY:
Still V-tach.

20:39.806 --> 20:40.907
All right, charge
again to 60.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.041
Let's open an intubation tray.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.310
Her chemistries
are almost ready.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.544
And clear.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.678
Okay, sinus tach.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.046
Another half bolus
of lido.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.047
Say that again.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.316
More lidocaine.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.717
Eight-point-three, thanks.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.788
Well, her potassium's
eight-point-three.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.557
All right, 30cc's
of bicarb,

20:57.590 --> 20:59.492
five units regular
insulin, amp of D25.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.394
T waves are peaked.

21:02.829 --> 21:03.996
You should have
listened to...

21:04.030 --> 21:05.498
Yeah, can we
do this later?

21:05.532 --> 21:07.534
Kayexelate by NG,
call for dialysis,

21:07.567 --> 21:10.537
and let's open a 12
French double lumen
femoral catheter.

21:11.804 --> 21:12.805
Spell the last name again.

21:12.839 --> 21:13.840
Johnson.

21:13.873 --> 21:17.510
J-o-h-n-s-o-n.

21:17.544 --> 21:18.745
"Specimen pending."

21:18.778 --> 21:20.480
Says Dr. Shine
is reviewing the slide.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.814
Where's Dr. Shine?

21:21.848 --> 21:23.049
Hey, you can't go
back there.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.451
Sorry, won't
happen again.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.585
Hey, this is
authorized personnel only.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.653
I'll only be
a second.

21:26.686 --> 21:27.687
Dr. Shine?

21:27.720 --> 21:30.757
Dr. Shine?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.625
Dr. Shine?

21:33.893 --> 21:35.428
Are you working
on Denise Johnson?

21:35.462 --> 21:36.463
Who wants to know?

21:36.496 --> 21:38.898
She's crashing
in the ER.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.833
This is a very
unusual smear.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.676
MARQUEZ:
Pressure's up to 95.

21:49.709 --> 21:50.843
CORDAY:
Fluid looks clear.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.379
Hang two of
type specific.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.080
No, don't give
her type specific.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.948
She has an autoimmune
hemolytic anemia.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.550
Give her type specific,
she'll go into renal failure.

21:57.584 --> 21:58.785
Where's the lab slip?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.753
I reviewed the slide
with Dr. Shine.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.855
She's got microspherocytes,
hyperbilirubinemia

22:02.889 --> 22:04.624
and a high
retic count.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.926
Hang more
of O-neg.
Get Shine on the phone.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.428
She said she
was driving,

22:08.461 --> 22:10.497
and when she
woke up, she
was upside down.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.399
The anemia could have
made her pass out, right?

22:12.399 --> 22:13.433
MARQUEZ:
I have Dr. Chen
for Dr. Shine.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.901
Dr. Shine, line one.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.035
Dr. Shine...

22:16.068 --> 22:17.136
Pressure's 105,
pulse is down.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.538
...a med student was
just up there.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.072
Damn, girl.

22:26.913 --> 22:27.647
E.R., please hold.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.681
E.R. What?
E.R.

22:28.715 --> 22:29.782
No, this is
not CICU.

22:29.816 --> 22:30.983
No, you have
the wrong extension.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.118
OB is 1687.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.653
E.R. No, this is not
the cafeteria.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.054
E.R. No, sorry.
Surgical Post Op
is 7204.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.156
Why would I
transfer you?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.058
E.R.
E.R.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.594
What the hell
is going on?!

22:41.628 --> 22:43.630
Hey, jagoff, what,
are you screwing up

22:43.663 --> 22:44.797
our phone lines now, too?

22:44.831 --> 22:45.798
What are we
going to do?

22:45.832 --> 22:47.033
Don't answer 'em.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.535
Charts for waiting
patients are over here.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.737
Do an H&P and call me.
You ever do history?

22:50.770 --> 22:51.771
Yeah.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.005
Good. Grab an easy one

22:53.039 --> 22:54.774
and come find me
when you're ready.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.544
Hey,

22:57.577 --> 22:59.746
don't you cats hear
the phones ringing?

23:05.752 --> 23:06.786
Med student?

23:06.819 --> 23:07.954
Mm-hmm.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.456
Hey, I saw you
a bit earlier.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.590
Your first day?

23:10.623 --> 23:12.124
Yeah.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.595
Are you Indian?

23:15.628 --> 23:17.497
Yeah. Punjabi.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.532
FRANK:
Perfect.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.736
This must be, uh,
quite an adjustment for you.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.572
Uh, no, not really.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.574
My family moved to London
when I was 11.

23:27.607 --> 23:30.042
Yale for molecular biology
and biophysics

23:30.076 --> 23:32.745
and Chicago
for medical school.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.080
Okay, then.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.616
Let's get you started.

23:36.649 --> 23:37.884
Whoa.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.085
Penile discharge.

23:39.118 --> 23:42.722
Probably not your
ideal first patient.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.056
AV infected graft.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.057
Sounds about right.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.659
Come on.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.562
What the hell is going on
down here?

23:49.596 --> 23:51.130
Hey, glad to see
you, Dr. Romano.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.500
Yeah, I doubt it.
Who was that?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.902
One of those University
of Calcutta carpetbaggers

23:55.935 --> 23:57.203
you people
insist on hiring.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.905
I think she said
she went to Yale.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.907
Yeah, her daddy's
probably a drug lord.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.511
Built a new wing
on the Yale library
with his poppy profits.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.678
How's the arm?

24:05.712 --> 24:06.746
Gone. How's
the prostate?

24:06.779 --> 24:07.947
About the size
of your head.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.816
I'm up four times
a night to pee.

24:09.849 --> 24:10.950
What's with the beard?

24:10.983 --> 24:12.151
I hear the
ladies like it.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.686
Whose bright idea
was all this anyway?

24:13.720 --> 24:14.687
ALL:
Weaver!

24:14.721 --> 24:16.022
Dr. Romano,
you're back.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.123
Yeah, try to hide
your wild enthusiasm

24:17.156 --> 24:18.725
at my return.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.026
I find overt displays
of emotion embarrassing.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.961
Hey, page Weaver for me.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.095
Dr. Carter, you got a minute?

24:23.129 --> 24:25.031
Lumens are flushed. Cut.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.602
Bactroban and opsite.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.205
Call me if
you need me.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.542
I won't.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.045
What do you got?

24:39.078 --> 24:40.179
HIV-positive patient.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.548
Came in a couple
of weeks ago

24:41.581 --> 24:42.815
with oral candidiasis.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.551
Got a prescription
for Nystatin,

24:44.584 --> 24:46.252
but he's back,
with worse.

24:46.285 --> 24:49.255
What was that
all about?

24:49.288 --> 24:50.923
The moons must be
lined up or something

24:50.957 --> 24:52.291
'cause Jing-Mei's
pissed off, too.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.860
What's Deb upset about?

24:53.893 --> 24:55.227
Misunderstanding.

24:55.261 --> 24:58.565
Abby still mad at you?

24:58.598 --> 24:59.666
So what did you
do, anyway?

24:59.699 --> 25:00.967
Oh, I don't know.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.802
I left, I guess.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.203
This guy's not
on Medicaid?

25:04.236 --> 25:07.574
No, he's uninsured,
so I referred him to ADAP.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.108
So, what do you
want to do with him?

25:09.141 --> 25:10.643
ADAP's out of money.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.111
They told him it would be
at least two months

25:12.144 --> 25:13.980
before they could get him
started on his meds

25:14.013 --> 25:15.582
if he's only HIV positive.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.754
Mr. Williams?

25:21.788 --> 25:23.890
Hello, I'm Dr. Carter.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.058
Mind if I take a look?

25:28.928 --> 25:30.863
How long has he been
HIV positive?

25:30.897 --> 25:33.933
Two years.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.234
Does it hurt when
you swallow?

25:35.267 --> 25:36.769
Mm-hmm.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.807
I've been taking
my medication.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.642
You're not on
the triple cocktail?

25:42.675 --> 25:44.310
AZT, 3TC?

25:44.343 --> 25:47.146
No, uh, I have a prescription,
but the guy at the pharmacy

25:47.179 --> 25:49.115
told me it's 1,200 bucks.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.983
I can't afford that.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.185
Well, I've got some good
news and some bad news.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.622
Um, the oral thrush
from last week

25:55.655 --> 25:59.158
has spread down
into your esophagus.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.860
That's the bad news, huh?

26:00.893 --> 26:03.295
No, actually...
that's the good news.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.998
It's a, um,
an opportunistic infection.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.667
It means you now qualify
for Medicaid

26:07.700 --> 26:11.303
and the anti-retroviral
therapy.

26:11.337 --> 26:14.306
So what's the bad news?

26:14.340 --> 26:19.712
Candidal esophagitis
is an AIDS-defining infection.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.684
That's why
you qualify now.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.660
I have AIDS?

26:35.327 --> 26:37.964
Uh...

26:37.997 --> 26:39.098
We're going to write you
a prescription

26:39.131 --> 26:40.266
for Diflucan

26:40.299 --> 26:43.736
to help fight
the infection.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.004
What is that going to cost?

26:45.037 --> 26:46.906
Nothing. Medicaid's
going to cover it,

26:46.939 --> 26:48.975
and we'll send you up
to the financial
counselor's office

26:49.008 --> 26:50.977
to help get your paperwork
straightened out.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.982
He came straight
from the airport
to your place.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.017
That's got to tell
you something.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.686
What, he's horny?

26:59.719 --> 27:01.688
Or that he really
missed you

27:01.688 --> 27:03.122
and felt badly about
leaving that way.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.724
Tell him how it
made you feel

27:04.757 --> 27:06.125
and give him the chance
to make up for it.

27:06.158 --> 27:08.394
Oh, for God's sake,

27:08.427 --> 27:10.196
where are we
supposed to go?
Second floor.

27:10.229 --> 27:11.263
Screw that.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.431
I mean, he just shows
back up

27:12.464 --> 27:14.133
like he never went away...

27:14.166 --> 27:15.434
and like he wasn't
a jerk

27:15.467 --> 27:17.804
for leaving like that,
and like...

27:17.837 --> 27:19.806
That's the men's room.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.073
Howdy, boys.
Don't mind me.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.408
Guard the door for me,
would you?

27:29.181 --> 27:31.050
Make up for it how?

27:31.083 --> 27:33.019
Flowers, a nice dinner.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.221
If you're really mad,
jewelry.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.726
I could use a
new transmission
for my car.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.894
You're a real romantic,
you know that?

27:41.928 --> 27:43.796
AV graft connects
the brachial vein

27:43.830 --> 27:46.899
to the brachial artery
for easy dialysis access.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.234
See the redness
and the swelling?

27:48.267 --> 27:49.268
Mm-hmm.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.302
Is there any
pain here?

27:50.336 --> 27:51.738
It hurts like hell.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.405
Yeah, the fluctuance
and the infection

27:53.439 --> 27:55.174
is pointing
with discharge.

27:55.207 --> 27:58.377
Feel for the thrill
over the graft.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.411
Listen for a bruit.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.849
You have beautiful skin.

28:02.882 --> 28:03.883
Thank you.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.351
You use anything
special on it?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.386
Not really.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.388
What a lovely color.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.257
Lastly, you want
to check the heart

28:11.290 --> 28:13.893
to make sure
there's no murmur.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.094
What do you think
we'd be worried about?

28:15.127 --> 28:17.864
Bacterial endocarditis.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.031
Good, good.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.099
So what do we need?

28:20.132 --> 28:21.133
Labs?

28:21.167 --> 28:23.502
Yep. CBC, Chem 7,

28:23.535 --> 28:25.872
Gram stain,
and a culture
from the abcess,

28:25.905 --> 28:28.007
and get me, uh, three grams
of Unasyn IV piggyback.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.508
Uh, do we drain it?

28:29.541 --> 28:30.877
No, not in the E.R.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.845
She goes to the O.R.
for an I and D...

28:32.879 --> 28:34.881
so check her vitals
every 15 minutes

28:34.914 --> 28:38.785
until she, uh, goes up
to the O.R., and, uh...

28:38.818 --> 28:40.820
grab another chart.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.024
Just talk to him--
haven't you punished him
enough already?

28:45.057 --> 28:46.492
It's not about
punishing him.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.027
Oh, no...
ROMANO:
I'm chair now, Kerry...

28:48.060 --> 28:49.528
You know, if he starts
in on me again,

28:49.561 --> 28:51.197
I swear I'm going
to cut the other arm off.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.498
We need more beds...

28:52.531 --> 28:54.033
...a same-day
surgery center

28:54.066 --> 28:55.534
so that we get more
paying customers

28:55.567 --> 28:56.836
into this place.
That's not your
concern anymore.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.104
This department
is a money pit!

28:58.137 --> 28:59.806
We have more people
coming through the door,

28:59.806 --> 29:02.441
and we're legally
obligated to treat them.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.010
Which is why we
should grab some wood,

29:04.043 --> 29:05.044
nail the entrance shut,
and paint "Go away"

29:05.077 --> 29:06.979
in big letters.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.815
( sighs ):
Frank, are the phones
working again?

29:08.815 --> 29:10.349
Two lines. The rest
we don't answer.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.051
Some guy looking
for Cubs tickets

29:12.084 --> 29:13.519
last time I checked.

29:13.552 --> 29:15.021
Oh, Dr. Carter, that guy

29:15.054 --> 29:16.355
from the foundation
called again.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.523
Did you take
a message?

29:17.556 --> 29:19.258
No, I told him
you were here.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.227
He said he was coming by
with some papers to sign.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.829
I don't want him
coming by here
while I'm working.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.496
Well, tell him yourself
when you see him.

29:24.530 --> 29:29.001
( welder's torch zapping )

29:41.347 --> 29:42.849
Hey.
Hey.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.184
You want to...
get a cup of coffee?
Yeah.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.452
Okay.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.856
Excuse me, Dr.
Carter, right?

29:49.856 --> 29:51.223
Tom Williams.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.159
Uh, you sent me up to
financial counseling

29:53.192 --> 29:55.461
to get on Medicaid for
my throat medication?

29:55.494 --> 29:56.562
Right.

29:56.595 --> 29:57.596
I filled out
the paperwork

29:57.629 --> 29:59.231
and I went to the pharmacy,

29:59.265 --> 30:01.000
but they can't give
me the prescription

30:01.033 --> 30:03.235
until I get my Medicaid card.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.037
Should I keep taking
Nystatin until then?

30:05.071 --> 30:06.973
Did they say how long
it was going to take
to get the card?

30:07.006 --> 30:08.107
A few weeks.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.475
You need to take
the Diflucan now.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.110
Can you cover
the cost of the prescription

30:11.143 --> 30:12.578
till the card comes in?

30:12.611 --> 30:14.947
It's 300 bucks.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.049
Okay, hang out.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.384
I'll call the pharmacy
myself.

30:18.417 --> 30:19.919
Now what?

30:19.952 --> 30:21.053
The pharmacy won't fill
his prescription

30:21.087 --> 30:22.989
till he gets his new
Medicaid card.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.256
Why don't we just
take him out back
and shoot him?

30:24.290 --> 30:25.892
It'd be easier.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.327
My Frank died four years ago.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.329
Liver cancer.

30:32.064 --> 30:35.034
Married 52 years.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.003
I was a teenage bride.

30:37.036 --> 30:40.106
No, really, I, uh...

30:40.139 --> 30:42.041
I was 16.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.110
Never dated nobody else.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.379
Never kissed nobody else.

30:47.413 --> 30:50.516
Oh, boy, that man
was a perfect slob.

30:50.549 --> 30:54.286
God love him.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.522
Yeah, had six boys
to boot

30:56.555 --> 30:59.191
and not one of them
worth a damn.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.292
You married?

31:00.326 --> 31:03.162
No. I've been in school.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.464
Oh, well-well,
don't put it off
too long, dear.

31:05.497 --> 31:07.333
He doesn't have to be
handsome.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.402
Just make sure
he treats you right.

31:10.436 --> 31:13.940
Okay. All done,
Mrs. Ferguson.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.943
I'll be back soon.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.215
Wait, where do you think
you're going?

31:23.249 --> 31:24.516
It's 2:30.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.052
So what?

31:26.085 --> 31:27.353
We stop at 2:30.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.055
It's barely lunchtime.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.056
We started at 7:00!

31:30.089 --> 31:32.358
I started at 6:00!

31:32.391 --> 31:34.060
This is unbelievable!

31:35.594 --> 31:37.063
Labs go...?

31:37.096 --> 31:39.431
Uh, right over there.

31:46.372 --> 31:47.706
How's it going?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.375
Dr. Gallant's been
very helpful.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.709
Oh, I'm pretty
sure he has been.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.978
You need another patient?

31:51.978 --> 31:52.644
Yeah.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.014
All right. Come on.

31:56.182 --> 31:57.416
( sighs ):
No...

31:57.449 --> 31:59.085
( laughs ):
No.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.519
Ah, here, try this.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.088
Take a history
and come find me.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.057
Okay.

32:05.091 --> 32:07.159
( phone ringing )

32:17.203 --> 32:19.238
Hello, Emergency Department.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.009
I-I-I'm sorry, I can't hear you
very well.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.643
For who?
Anybody seen
Carter?

32:24.676 --> 32:26.345
Yeah, he's outside
with Abby on a break.
Excuse me,

32:26.378 --> 32:28.280
but the phone was ringing,
and no one was around,

32:28.314 --> 32:30.149
so I thought
I should answer it.
Big mistake.

32:30.182 --> 32:33.152
It's long distance,
overseas for a Dr. Carter.

32:33.185 --> 32:36.022
Of course. Who else?
Take a message.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.024
Yeah, can I take
a message?

32:41.593 --> 32:43.429
Uh, they say
it's important.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.530
Someone has died.

32:44.563 --> 32:47.033
Who?
Someone named Kovac.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.101
A Dr. Luka Kovac.

33:00.779 --> 33:04.116
So how was it?

33:04.150 --> 33:07.286
It was incredible.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.754
And it was terrible.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.657
It was, um...

33:11.690 --> 33:13.192
It was kids with polio,

33:13.225 --> 33:16.262
it was kids dying
from malnutrition

33:16.295 --> 33:21.233
and malaria and
whooping cough and...

33:21.267 --> 33:22.701
And it was beautiful.

33:22.734 --> 33:25.071
I mean, the country's
beautiful.

33:26.505 --> 33:30.076
Hospital doesn't
have enough staff

33:30.076 --> 33:31.710
so the patients', uh,
family members,

33:31.743 --> 33:33.145
they stay with them.

33:33.179 --> 33:34.580
They cook for them,
they clean for them,

33:34.613 --> 33:37.149
they even, uh,
change the sheets.

33:39.085 --> 33:43.755
It was a life-changing
experience.

33:43.789 --> 33:47.326
I just don't
know how yet.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.633
Where's Luka?

33:56.768 --> 33:59.205
Is that what this
is about?

33:59.238 --> 34:02.308
No.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.110
Luka's fine.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.377
Luka's more than fine.

34:05.411 --> 34:06.712
What does that mean?

34:06.745 --> 34:07.713
Nothing.

34:07.746 --> 34:08.780
Nothing.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.554
Do you know we don't talk?

34:16.588 --> 34:18.290
We're not talking now?

34:18.324 --> 34:21.127
Your mouth is moving.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.393
I mean, you give the impression

34:22.428 --> 34:24.330
we're having
a real conversation,

34:24.362 --> 34:26.364
but when you finish, I have
no idea what you're thinking.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.801
I was trying to tell
you about Africa.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.471
I don't know.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.739
You knew I didn't want
you to go and you went anyway.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.706
What, were you trying
to hurt me?

34:35.741 --> 34:38.143
( sighs )

34:38.143 --> 34:39.445
Why would I
want to hurt you?

34:39.478 --> 34:40.679
I don't know.
I don't know.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.414
Why would you
want to hurt me?

34:42.447 --> 34:43.449
It wasn't about you.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.217
Oh, come on.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.452
You weren't even going
to tell me you were going.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.320
If hadn't
bumped into you

34:48.353 --> 34:50.255
when you were leaving, I
wouldn't have even known.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.591
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

34:52.623 --> 34:53.659
I wanted
to feel like

34:53.692 --> 34:55.293
I was really doing something.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.395
Did you even
think about me?

34:56.428 --> 34:58.230
Yes.
Okay.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.331
What did you think?

35:03.435 --> 35:05.371
What did you think?

35:07.806 --> 35:09.241
I don't know why you
bothered to come back.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.776
You just going
to walk away?
Yeah.

35:10.809 --> 35:11.777
Okay, walk away,
Abby.

35:11.810 --> 35:12.778
That's what you
do best.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.580
Okay.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.215
You want to know
what you do best?

35:16.248 --> 35:18.217
You make this
all about my problems,

35:18.250 --> 35:20.619
but you know what,
you have some problems, too.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.789
You've got some
really big problems.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.324
Why did I come back?

35:25.357 --> 35:27.326
I mean, Luka's over there
changing the world

35:27.359 --> 35:28.694
and I can't even
get a hospital pharmacy

35:28.727 --> 35:30.696
in the richest
nation on Earth

35:30.729 --> 35:32.631
to give an AIDS
patient enough damn

35:32.664 --> 35:37.203
Diflucin to him... from dying
from a sore throat.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.674
Kisangani, West Africa.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.546
Do they know how?

35:47.579 --> 35:48.547
No.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.948
Does he have family here?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.317
No.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.696
Hey.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.532
You okay?

36:06.565 --> 36:07.933
I didn't know him.
Who was he?

36:07.966 --> 36:09.568
An attending.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.537
Friend?

36:11.570 --> 36:13.772
No, not really.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.674
So how's
your shunt?

36:15.707 --> 36:17.309
That's where I'm going.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.644
Well keep an eye
on her.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.746
Surgery should be down soon.

36:25.884 --> 36:28.254
Where did she go?

36:28.287 --> 36:30.256
Do you know where
my patient went, Mrs. Ferguson?

36:30.289 --> 36:31.890
Infected dialysis shunt,
older woman.

36:31.923 --> 36:34.660
I have no idea.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.328
What's up?

36:36.362 --> 36:37.863
Ready to present that
old guy in Curtain One?

36:37.896 --> 36:39.398
Mm, yeah.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.567
All right.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.335
Uh, 72-year-old man

36:43.369 --> 36:45.937
notes constipation
without fever, nausea,

36:45.971 --> 36:48.774
vomiting, weight lose
or hematochezia.

36:48.807 --> 36:51.677
His only medication
is Vicodon TID.

36:51.710 --> 36:55.514
Abdomen is soft, flat,
non-tender.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.283
Normal
bowel sounds.

36:57.283 --> 37:00.952
Negative guaiac,
no evidence of inpaction.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.521
So what's your
assessment?

37:02.554 --> 37:06.325
Constipation due
to Vicadin use.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.693
What is
the number one

37:07.726 --> 37:10.296
neoplasm in terms
of national mortality?

37:10.962 --> 37:12.398
Breast cancer?

37:12.431 --> 37:13.965
No, that would be lung.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.467
And number two?

37:17.436 --> 37:18.504
Colon cancer.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.839
Over 50,000
deaths per year.

37:20.872 --> 37:23.775
The common
presenting symptoms are?

37:23.809 --> 37:26.312
Anemia, hematochezia
and constipation.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.480
So wouldn't you agree
that a constipated,

37:28.514 --> 37:32.050
elderly patient merits
an evaluation for colon cancer?

37:32.083 --> 37:33.619
The stool is negative.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.554
He got all bound up when
he started the Vicadin.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.955
Order a bowel
prep and schedule

37:36.988 --> 37:39.491
an out-patient barium enema.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.493
You're serious?

37:44.663 --> 37:45.897
You heard the lady.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.773
You know, you were
pretty rough on her.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.642
You really think
that was necessary?

37:56.675 --> 37:58.043
Who we talking
about?

37:58.076 --> 37:59.378
PRATT:
Come on now.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.579
I was trying to teach her.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.713
So whatever you think...

38:01.747 --> 38:04.616
Look, no, you
come on now.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.984
You were
all over her.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.519
It's humiliating
and embarrassing.

38:07.553 --> 38:08.854
I wasn't all over her.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.088
Look, don't make
a fool of me, okay?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.757
I'm not trying to make
a fool of you.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.625
Hey, there's an old lady
in here bleeding out.

38:13.659 --> 38:14.693
No breathing,

38:14.726 --> 38:15.761
no pulse.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.597
Get the crash cart.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.998
Bag her on 15 liters.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.099
Who's patient is this?

38:21.132 --> 38:23.369
She's mine.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.439
Greg, start
compressions.

38:27.473 --> 38:28.507
PRATT:
You're kidding.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.409
I'll do it.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.043
Excuse me,
I'll be right back.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.111
CHEN:
You left an infected

38:33.144 --> 38:34.946
AV graft
unattended.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.615
She needs a central line
and saline.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.984
No, what she needs is
a hearse and pine box.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.386
The graft was in
a major artery.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.853
She needed constant
monitoring.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.589
I was supposed to check her
every 15 minutes.

38:43.622 --> 38:44.590
GALLANT:
No, she was

38:44.623 --> 38:45.857
my responsibility.

38:45.891 --> 38:47.092
PRATT:
Asystole.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.594
Amp of epi.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.995
I went to her room
and she was gone.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.763
I thought she'd been
taken to surgery.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.399
I moved her in here
to give her more privacy

38:53.399 --> 38:54.666
for a 12 lead EKG.

38:54.700 --> 38:55.901
Did you tell anybody?

38:55.934 --> 38:57.803
Yeah, I changed it
on the board.

38:57.836 --> 38:58.870
CHEN:
Did you check
the patient board?

38:58.904 --> 39:00.606
It's not
her fault,

39:00.639 --> 39:01.707
it's mine.

39:01.740 --> 39:02.708
( sighs )

39:02.741 --> 39:03.909
Four units of packed cells,

39:03.942 --> 39:05.677
four liters of
saline and another

39:05.711 --> 39:07.112
round of EPI
and atropine.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.113
CARTER:
In Zagreb,

39:08.146 --> 39:09.848
Kovac, K-O-V-A-C.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.486
Uh, yeah, Croatia.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.788
You can connect me,
great.

39:18.890 --> 39:22.060
Yeah, uh... in Za...
English?

39:22.093 --> 39:24.563
You speak English?

39:24.596 --> 39:25.697
Zagreb, Kovac.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.634
K-O-V-A-C.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.038
Hey.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.974
Do you know Luka's
father's first name?

39:36.007 --> 39:39.678
There's like 100
Kovacs in Zagreb.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.580
Uh, okay, sorry.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.749
No, thank you,
thank you.

39:45.016 --> 39:47.453
What are you doing?

39:47.453 --> 39:48.920
The Alliance.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.489
They're going to have all
of his contact information.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.658
I can just get it from them.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.062
Do you know
who's this is?

40:00.666 --> 40:01.933
What are you doing?

40:01.967 --> 40:03.902
There's a 12:00
flight to Paris,

40:03.935 --> 40:05.070
and then I can
connect

40:05.103 --> 40:07.172
to Kinshasa with
a four-hour layover.

40:07.205 --> 40:09.741
Wait, wait, wait--
you're going to go back there?

40:09.775 --> 40:10.976
Why?

40:11.009 --> 40:12.511
Cause I left
him there.
Left him where?

40:12.544 --> 40:14.480
At the clinic in Matenda.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.516
I should
have stayed.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.551
You're not making
any sense.

40:19.585 --> 40:20.786
John.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.198
Doctor,
what are doing?

40:33.231 --> 40:36.568
I'll inventory it.
You can bill me.

40:54.686 --> 40:57.022
It wasn't
your fault.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.694
You've got blood on your sleeve.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.934
What's a TWA?

41:10.068 --> 41:11.169
What?

41:11.202 --> 41:14.640
A TWA.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.708
Where'd you hear that from?

41:16.742 --> 41:18.810
The old guy at the front desk
with the flat head,

41:18.844 --> 41:20.211
he called me a TWA this morning.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.681
I don't know what it means.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.962
Third World Assassin.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.564
TWA.

41:51.276 --> 41:54.580
Hey, come on, I want
to show you something.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.851
Come on.

42:34.820 --> 42:36.855
Was that today?

42:36.888 --> 42:39.124
32-year-old
mother of two

42:39.157 --> 42:41.660
with a rare blood
disorder.

42:41.693 --> 42:44.062
Still alive
tonight.

42:48.033 --> 42:50.268
I'll see you
tomorrow.

43:02.380 --> 43:03.949
You don't have
to go tonight.

43:03.982 --> 43:05.116
I'll call you
when I get to Paris.

43:05.150 --> 43:06.384
Just, can't you
just please wait

43:06.417 --> 43:07.653
until it's a
little bit safer?

43:07.653 --> 43:08.954
No, I can't leave him there.

43:08.987 --> 43:10.689
Well, just, I don't
want you to go.

43:10.722 --> 43:11.990
I'll be gone a couple days.
I'll call you.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.860
John, please,
please, just stay.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.295
I can't keep doing this.

43:18.305 --> 43:24.678
