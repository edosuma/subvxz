03:29.583 --> 03:32.291
I can't feel my legs!

03:34.000 --> 03:38.458
Don't think about that.
It will be ok.

03:43.416 --> 03:45.791
We're almost there, you know.

04:15.800 --> 04:19.850
<i><b>Based on real people and occurrences</b></i>

06:13.458 --> 06:16.208
Leave what you have stolen
and get lost.

06:16.291 --> 06:17.666
Get out!

06:17.750 --> 06:20.083
- Who are you?
- Who are <i>you?</i>

06:20.291 --> 06:22.458
I'm sorry. I am...

06:22.833 --> 06:25.541
- Roalds brother.
- Is that so?

06:32.666 --> 06:34.416
I am Leon.

06:34.541 --> 06:35.875
Sorry!

06:36.000 --> 06:38.875
No.
I didn't think there was anybody here.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.083
I didn't realize...

06:42.791 --> 06:44.416
Bess Magids.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.416
I arrived yesterday.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.833
Clearly he didn't mention me, then?

06:49.166 --> 06:50.708
No.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.250
I'm...

06:53.791 --> 06:56.666
Sorry for the interruption.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.875
- You can go back to bed again.
- No, that's quite allright.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I can't sleep.

07:03.083 --> 07:06.083
Probably still on Canada-time.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.208
How do you know my brother?

07:10.583 --> 07:13.500
We have known each other
a couple of years now.

07:15.916 --> 07:17.791
You haven't-

07:17.875 --> 07:20.791
-heard anything new, by chance?

07:22.041 --> 07:23.583
No.

07:27.500 --> 07:31.500
I know I've seen a bottle
of wine around here.

07:33.750 --> 07:38.875
I prefer Whiskey, personally,
but this is better than nothing.

07:46.500 --> 07:52.041
He was going to fly over the North pole
and get back in time to meet me here.

07:52.666 --> 07:54.791
Instead it was Wisting-

07:55.208 --> 07:57.333
-who received me.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.250
Wisting is a good man.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.166
He seemed more concerned than we are.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.416
Yes.

08:07.208 --> 08:09.750
It is strange to look at you.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.708
How so?

08:11.791 --> 08:13.666
Sorry.

08:13.750 --> 08:17.791
In the beginning I did not think
you two looked alike, but now...

08:17.875 --> 08:19.833
He didn't mention me?

08:22.208 --> 08:23.833
Well...

08:24.625 --> 08:26.708
He said he had many brothers.

08:27.083 --> 08:30.458
- But he hasn't talked about me.
- No, but...

08:30.500 --> 08:32.832
We don't talk about family and such.

08:32.916 --> 08:35.707
But he talked about the expeditions?

08:35.791 --> 08:38.000
About the Northwest
Passage and the South Pole.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.457
Of course.

08:39.791 --> 08:41.375
But not about me?

08:41.457 --> 08:42.791
No, but...

08:42.875 --> 08:45.500
You weren't in the expeditions.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.375
No.

08:59.083 --> 09:02.000
Roald and I don't speak.

09:02.666 --> 09:07.291
- It's been a few years since last time.
- Really? What happened?

09:11.375 --> 09:13.500
I'm sorry.
You don't have to answer that.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.500
It's ok.

09:23.333 --> 09:28.416
We were four brothers, but it was
mostly just Roald and I.

09:28.875 --> 09:31.083
<i>Did Roald mention our father?</i>

09:31.166 --> 09:36.375
<i>He owned ships, or something
like it. And was an... adventurer?</i>

09:36.458 --> 09:39.083
<i>Not exactly an adventurer.</i>

09:39.166 --> 09:43.041
<i>But he always came home
with the nicest gifts.</i>

09:46.166 --> 09:49.541
<i>I remember when he
brought that globe.</i>

09:55.250 --> 09:57.625
What is that in the middle, there?

09:57.708 --> 10:00.291
That's where the air
is let in to the flame.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.125
No what is there?

10:03.208 --> 10:04.791
In reality, in the world.

10:04.875 --> 10:09.333
Nobody knows.
Nobody have traveled that far north.

10:09.416 --> 10:11.500
Some people believe-

10:11.541 --> 10:13.833
-that there is a land there.

10:13.916 --> 10:15.916
Which hasn't been discovered yet.

10:16.500 --> 10:20.916
<i>Roald continued to stare
at the holes by the poles.</i>

10:21.041 --> 10:23.583
<i>Everything else had been charted.</i>

10:23.666 --> 10:25.500
<i>Those holes, -</i>

10:25.583 --> 10:27.250
<i>-those areas, -</i>

10:27.333 --> 10:30.625
<i>- was everything that remained
to discover.</i>

10:36.083 --> 10:38.416
<i>Roald became obsessed by the poles.</i>

10:39.666 --> 10:42.333
Look! Four degrees!

10:43.916 --> 10:48.500
<i>He started experimenting
with arctic conditions.</i>

10:49.375 --> 10:51.083
Good night.

10:53.541 --> 10:55.375
And now, you.

10:55.458 --> 10:58.833
- Just a little bit more?
- No, you can read more tomorrow.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.458
Good night, Roald.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.916
<i>Father died at sea.</i>

11:07.416 --> 11:10.041
<i>Thousands of miles away from home.</i>

11:10.708 --> 11:13.875
<i>And mother fell ill a few years later.</i>

11:15.708 --> 11:18.583
Leon, you have to watch over your brother.

11:18.666 --> 11:21.750
You're the big brother,
you have to take care of Roald.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.916
<i>When Fridtjof Nansen
came home victorious, -</i>

11:32.083 --> 11:36.041
<i>- as the first to cross
Greenland by skies, -</i>

11:36.125 --> 11:38.583
<i>-nothing could stop us.</i>

11:47.291 --> 11:52.500
<i>After that day Roald and I knew
exactly what we were going to be.</i>

11:54.750 --> 11:58.000
<i>Our first great test was
a trip on the Hardanger plain.</i>

11:58.083 --> 11:59.791
<i>The wind increased to a storm.</i>

11:59.875 --> 12:02.750
<i>I walked in a circle all night.</i>

12:03.250 --> 12:05.916
<i>But in the morning Roald was gone.</i>

12:06.708 --> 12:08.333
Roald!

12:11.250 --> 12:15.500
<i>Instead of going in a circle, he had
dug himself a snow cave.</i>

12:15.583 --> 12:21.083
<i>But the temperature had dropped,
so he woke in a sarcophagus of ice.</i>

12:23.250 --> 12:25.083
<i>Roald!</i>

12:35.083 --> 12:36.750
Roald!

12:37.333 --> 12:39.083
Roald!

12:49.166 --> 12:50.791
Hold on!

13:19.750 --> 13:22.041
<i>His reaction made me realize-</i>

13:22.125 --> 13:25.125
<i>- that he had something
that I didn't.</i>

13:25.208 --> 13:27.333
<i>I didn't know what.</i>

13:27.833 --> 13:31.250
<i>Only that I undisputedly did not have it.</i>

13:31.916 --> 13:34.208
You saved his life.

13:39.291 --> 13:44.458
I'm just waiting for him to
walk through that door.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.375
Go on, please.

13:52.458 --> 13:55.375
It does me good to hear you speak.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.875
- Northwest Passage?
- Yes.

14:20.250 --> 14:24.083
Roald was aboard the first ship that
spent the winter in the Antarctic.

14:24.375 --> 14:27.625
After that he had
this insane idea.

14:27.708 --> 14:32.291
To use a small fishing vessel, where the
great British ships had failed.

14:32.791 --> 14:34.416
You didn't go along?

14:34.500 --> 14:35.875
No, no.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.916
I stayed at home to organize
the financial support.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.916
Roald went to face the ice.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.458
And you, the lenders.

14:44.291 --> 14:49.875
The first one to sail through the
last part of the Northwest Passage.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.541
The promising, young Norwegian discoverer-

14:53.625 --> 14:55.125
- Roald Amundsen!

15:06.875 --> 15:08.833
Thank you. It is...

15:15.458 --> 15:16.750
Thank you.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.916
It is...

15:19.041 --> 15:21.250
It is a great honor to be here.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.083
Thank you.

15:24.500 --> 15:28.041
I would also like to thank you, Dr. Nansen.

15:28.125 --> 15:31.500
I would not be here today-

15:31.583 --> 15:35.000
- without your good advice and support.
Thank you.

15:37.666 --> 15:40.208
During our search for
the Northwest Passage-

15:40.291 --> 15:44.833
- we spent two winters in a small,
completely isolated port-

15:44.916 --> 15:47.500
-called Uqsuqtuuq.

15:48.583 --> 15:51.250
We called the place GjÃ¸ahavn

15:51.333 --> 15:53.458
A little easier to prononounce.

15:54.833 --> 15:58.708
And here we got the opportunity to meet-

15:58.791 --> 16:02.541
-and study the netsilik-inuites.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.541
They imparted upon us invaluable knowledge-

16:05.625 --> 16:09.416
-on how to survive arctic conditions.

16:09.791 --> 16:14.791
They move efficiently across the ice
using light sleighs-

16:14.875 --> 16:16.666
-and polar dogs.

16:16.750 --> 16:18.500
And this method-

16:18.583 --> 16:20.583
-was deciding for us-

16:20.666 --> 16:23.500
-when we explored the area.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.833
The life of the Netsilikes-

16:26.916 --> 16:30.375
-is clearly unique and very specialized.

16:30.458 --> 16:34.500
And they are now among the last natives-

16:34.583 --> 16:39.000
- who haven't been in touch with
missionaries from the south.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.833
Just wait!

16:48.041 --> 16:49.875
It is...

16:51.208 --> 16:53.625
I have heard a lot of strange things-

16:53.708 --> 16:55.500
-about the inuites

16:56.166 --> 16:58.500
That they are lazy, for instance.

16:58.541 --> 17:00.541
They are not lazy.

17:00.625 --> 17:04.375
They are smart.
They know that stress causes you to sweat.

17:04.458 --> 17:08.708
And if you're sweating in low
temperatures, you may die.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.790
<i>Roald had learned survival
techniques from the inuites.</i>

17:12.875 --> 17:16.915
<i>And so our dream was to be fulfilled:
To be the first to reach the North Pole.</i>

17:17.040 --> 17:22.750
<i>But the brits did not take
these survival-ideas seriously.</i>

17:22.833 --> 17:25.375
<i>Even as they were planning
their own expedition.</i>

17:25.458 --> 17:29.625
That was a very well executed
lecture, Amundsen.

17:29.708 --> 17:33.333
The English are sceptical to
the Greenland Dogs.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.791
They prefer setters.

17:37.250 --> 17:39.000
Mr. Scott!

17:40.083 --> 17:43.375
- Old friend. How are you doing?
- Good to see you.

17:43.458 --> 17:46.666
- I assume you two have met?
- No.

17:46.750 --> 17:50.208
Roald Amundsen,
this is Robert Falcon Scott.

17:50.625 --> 17:52.041
A pleasure.

17:52.125 --> 17:55.750
And congratulations.
I am... mightily impressed.

17:55.833 --> 17:58.416
The pleasure is all mine.

17:58.500 --> 18:02.083
The stories of the British explorers-

18:02.166 --> 18:06.166
- changed my life.
John Franklin, for instance.

18:06.250 --> 18:09.166
It was the British that
paved the way for us.

18:09.250 --> 18:12.125
But somebody had to take the last step.

18:12.208 --> 18:15.000
In that tiny little fishing boat.

18:15.083 --> 18:18.541
- Who would have thought it?
- She was weary in the end.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.041
And you?

18:20.250 --> 18:22.000
Ambassador Nansen?

18:23.166 --> 18:26.791
I expect you are ready to travel again?

18:30.291 --> 18:32.416
Are you going to one of the poles?

18:32.833 --> 18:34.708
Which one will it be?

18:35.166 --> 18:37.208
North or South?

18:37.291 --> 18:40.125
I'm still caught up in diplomacy.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.208
Of course.

18:43.083 --> 18:46.250
There are more important things
than exploring ice.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.791
Gentlemen...

18:49.333 --> 18:50.916
A true pleasure.

18:57.708 --> 18:59.875
Do you think he's going north or south?

19:00.041 --> 19:02.708
The most important thing to research-

19:02.791 --> 19:05.291
- in the arctic realm
is not who comes first, -

19:05.416 --> 19:11.250
- but the exploration of the polar basin's
reach, depth and character.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.166
They are planning expeditions, all of them.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.125
We don't have a lot of time.

19:24.541 --> 19:30.000
If we are to manage 3000 km in 100 days we
have to reduce weight and increase speed.

19:30.083 --> 19:35.541
And the english have motor vehicles.
Scott has tested up at Finse.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.916
And I believe in Polar Bears
as a beast of burden.

19:39.041 --> 19:43.041
That does not mean I'm going for it
in this context.

19:43.125 --> 19:47.250
Only one thing is sufficiently tested
and tried for something like this.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.333
That is Greenland Dogs.

19:49.416 --> 19:51.541
Many Greenland Dogs.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.375
<i>Suddenly Nansen's wife fell ill.</i>

19:55.458 --> 19:59.708
<i>And we saw an opportunity to
borrow his ship, Fram.</i>

20:00.250 --> 20:02.125
Go away.
We don't want any visitors.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.083
I understand.
I'm sorry.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.583
My name is Roald Amundsen.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.166
Your father knows me well.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.833
Perhaps if he's told that it is me, -

20:13.000 --> 20:15.125
-that will change things?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.666
You can have Fram.

20:26.500 --> 20:29.166
There are two conditions. One:

20:30.500 --> 20:32.458
Hjalmar Johansen-

20:32.500 --> 20:34.833
-is constantly coming asking for money.

20:34.916 --> 20:38.208
But it is I who am indebted to him.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.833
He deserves another chance.

20:40.916 --> 20:44.166
I thought perhaps Johansen was
unable to...

20:44.250 --> 20:47.125
- He is still drinking?
- Hjalmar comes.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.791
And the other?

20:50.875 --> 20:55.208
Fram is not to be used to a
breakneck race to the North Pole.

20:55.291 --> 20:58.291
You are traveling in service of Science.

20:58.875 --> 21:01.666
Science. Do you understand me?

21:01.750 --> 21:05.833
Black painted six-person tents,
20 pairs of hickory skis, -

21:05.916 --> 21:08.041
-five cooking trays, two sextants, -

21:08.125 --> 21:13.500
- one liquid compass, two binoculars, two
photographic cameras and three hypsometers.

21:13.541 --> 21:16.583
One of the challenges
with regard to speed, -

21:16.666 --> 21:23.166
- is that when the temperature is lower than
minus 25, the snow can change consistency.

21:23.250 --> 21:28.541
We will solve that by adding a thin
layer of ice under the sleigh runners

21:28.625 --> 21:30.291
The weight will still be crucial.

21:30.416 --> 21:32.708
We have to get under one tonne per sleigh.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.166
Then we've got the dogs.

21:35.583 --> 21:38.708
- What do you mean?
- The weight will gradually be reduced.

21:38.791 --> 21:41.750
So we won't need as
many dogs.

21:41.833 --> 21:48.166
Greenland Dogs are cannibals, so they will
be good provisions for us and them alike.

21:49.250 --> 21:53.416
This is nature. Dog is no worse than pig.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.666
Do you think there's a
difference between dog and pork?

21:55.791 --> 21:57.500
I think most people do.

21:57.583 --> 22:03.000
I don't think it's pleasant eating
loyal traveling companions.

22:03.083 --> 22:08.708
Here the question is whether we want
to come first, or it's no big deal.

22:12.208 --> 22:13.875
Wisting!

22:15.625 --> 22:18.916
<i>We started gathering the crew.</i>

22:19.041 --> 22:20.916
Was it 200 meters?

22:21.041 --> 22:22.500
210!

22:22.583 --> 22:24.541
Just you see-

22:24.916 --> 22:29.583
- you'll be the first one to
discover new land up there in the ice.

22:29.666 --> 22:33.583
Thank you, but that is a glory I want
you to have, captain.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.875
...all information. All information.

22:53.250 --> 22:55.000
What is it?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.666
Captain.

22:58.750 --> 23:01.166
I came as quickly as I could.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.750
Is anything amiss?

23:07.083 --> 23:08.791
Roald?

23:17.208 --> 23:18.916
What does it say?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.833
"North pole reached."

23:23.583 --> 23:25.500
Frederick Cook?

23:26.541 --> 23:28.875
"Cook left his log books on Greenland."

23:29.041 --> 23:30.791
He's got no proof.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.125
The expedition is dead.

23:33.750 --> 23:38.708
- If he wasn't really there...
- When he doesn't have proof?

23:47.791 --> 23:49.500
Roald is right.

23:51.875 --> 23:53.708
As long as they claim that, -

23:53.791 --> 23:56.291
-it's not newsworthy any longer.

23:57.500 --> 24:01.750
Then nobody will want to fund
the expedition.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.000
It is over.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.250
We go on.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.541
We head to the South Pole.

25:13.083 --> 25:15.833
We'll just do it.
Just do it.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.458
All right. Fine.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.041
But how?

25:20.125 --> 25:23.291
We keep it a secret.
And then we give it all we've got.

25:23.416 --> 25:24.875
Nobody will know.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.125
So, completely quiet.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.833
Yes.

25:29.375 --> 25:32.500
That means we will have to lie to all.

25:32.541 --> 25:35.458
Nansen, of course, but...

25:37.875 --> 25:39.541
Also to the King.

25:40.541 --> 25:42.375
But that...

25:43.416 --> 25:45.833
We won't think about that.

25:48.458 --> 25:51.333
Let's think about what will happen-

25:51.916 --> 25:54.000
-if this succeeds.

25:58.041 --> 25:59.791
I mean, imagine if it succeeds.

25:59.875 --> 26:01.708
Imagine if it succeeds!

26:07.750 --> 26:09.541
Hi, Hjalmar.

26:13.916 --> 26:15.666
Yes?

26:15.750 --> 26:19.666
You don't intend to bring that
cabin north?

26:19.750 --> 26:23.500
You do know it will be
crushed by the ice?

26:23.583 --> 26:25.500
Twisted into the sea.

26:25.583 --> 26:28.708
You aren't that certain to
find land up there?

26:31.625 --> 26:34.125
You've been rowing all
the way from Kristiania?

26:34.208 --> 26:35.833
Certainly.

26:35.916 --> 26:39.750
- Have to use your energy for something.
- Yes you do.

26:40.708 --> 26:42.458
Yes, I...

26:43.500 --> 26:45.625
I'm a completely different person-

26:45.708 --> 26:47.833
-up there in the ice.

26:47.916 --> 26:49.416
Just ask Nansen.

26:51.500 --> 26:55.375
When he twisted his back,
I had to carry him.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.625
Did you know that?

26:59.875 --> 27:02.125
No, I guess that's how it is.

27:02.208 --> 27:04.875
We are all better men up there.

27:07.666 --> 27:10.250
You aren't coming along, then?

27:12.208 --> 27:14.000
A little on the aging side?

27:14.083 --> 27:17.333
- Two years older than you.
- No more than that?

27:18.458 --> 27:20.666
No, I'll have to stay here at home.

27:20.750 --> 27:23.083
We are still not fully funded.

27:23.166 --> 27:26.208
I talked to a radio producer.

27:28.083 --> 27:30.500
I can't bring a radio.

27:30.583 --> 27:35.208
Then Nansen will get in touch
with me, ask me to turn around.

27:35.666 --> 27:38.250
When are we going to tell him?

27:41.875 --> 27:43.666
When it is too late.

27:51.875 --> 27:55.666
There are many
who have raised questions-

27:55.750 --> 27:58.041
-regarding this expedition.

27:58.791 --> 28:03.333
Why would we bring a cabin
up on the drift ice in the Arctic?

28:03.416 --> 28:07.125
Why have we brought along
90 Greenland Dogs from Kristiansand, -

28:07.250 --> 28:11.750
- instead of picking them up in Alaska
when we are sailing North again.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.500
And the truth is-

28:15.208 --> 28:17.041
-that...

28:17.791 --> 28:19.875
We have no plans-

28:20.000 --> 28:23.291
-to sail North again-

28:23.375 --> 28:25.750
-when we sail around Cape North.

28:28.333 --> 28:31.083
We will continue South.

28:34.125 --> 28:37.791
The brits have major plans to
add Antarctica to their Empire.

28:37.875 --> 28:40.875
Robert Scott is on his way with 65 men, -

28:41.000 --> 28:44.125
-motor vehicles and horses.

28:44.208 --> 28:47.083
It seems like the only thing-

28:48.083 --> 28:50.583
-he has forgotten to consider, -

28:51.541 --> 28:52.916
-is us.

28:53.875 --> 28:56.125
Because it is we-

28:56.208 --> 28:58.583
-who will be the first-

28:59.250 --> 29:01.250
-to the South Pole.

29:03.291 --> 29:07.583
So now I really only need to know
that I've got your full-

29:08.625 --> 29:10.125
-support.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.000
And that-

29:12.083 --> 29:14.291
- those who wish to
be a part of this-

29:14.416 --> 29:16.375
-raise your hand.

29:33.583 --> 29:35.833
Good.
Then that is how it will be.

29:42.208 --> 29:44.458
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

29:48.875 --> 29:53.625
<i>Right this moment King Haakon
is being informed of the change of plans.</i>

29:53.708 --> 29:57.083
<i>I ask you not to judge me too harshly.</i>

29:57.166 --> 30:01.500
<i>I assure you that I one day will
continue with the original plan.</i>

30:01.583 --> 30:06.500
<i>With scientific research of the
oceanic currents around the North Pole.</i>

30:18.625 --> 30:22.291
This is no longer an expedition.
This is a race.

30:43.416 --> 30:45.750
<i>This is Antarctica.</i>

30:47.458 --> 30:49.625
<i>The coldest place in the world.</i>

30:49.708 --> 30:51.916
<i>A desert of ice.</i>

30:53.750 --> 30:59.083
<i>The first thing we'll do, is building
our cabin, Framheim, in the Bay of Whales.</i>

30:59.166 --> 31:05.500
<i>This is where we are staying the winter,
after we have deployed supply caches.</i>

31:05.541 --> 31:08.208
<i>As soon as the sun returns, -</i>

31:08.291 --> 31:12.041
<i>- we will begin
our 1300 kilometer long journey-</i>

31:12.125 --> 31:13.750
<i>-towards the South Pole.</i>

31:15.250 --> 31:17.125
<i>There is no map, -</i>

31:17.208 --> 31:21.000
<i>- almost no information
about what awaits us.</i>

31:21.083 --> 31:23.666
<i>Only the certainty that here-</i>

31:23.750 --> 31:25.791
<i>-no humans-</i>

31:25.875 --> 31:28.250
<i>-have ever been.</i>

32:11.041 --> 32:12.875
It is -56C!

32:14.291 --> 32:16.083
We must turn around!

32:17.666 --> 32:19.666
We are not grouped!

32:19.750 --> 32:22.500
We will go back.
Every person by himself.

32:22.583 --> 32:25.041
Tell the others.

32:26.833 --> 32:28.666
Are you ok?

32:29.791 --> 32:31.833
Yes, we're coming!

33:14.458 --> 33:16.125
So, you...

33:16.208 --> 33:18.375
You took your time?

33:26.125 --> 33:28.541
It was too soon to go out.

33:29.625 --> 33:31.041
You left us.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.625
You left...

33:32.708 --> 33:34.041
I said it clearly.

33:34.166 --> 33:37.666
On the way back everybody were individually
responsible to find the way back home.

33:37.791 --> 33:40.500
You don't leave your crew-

33:41.041 --> 33:42.416
-to die!

33:42.500 --> 33:44.041
In a blizzard!

33:48.750 --> 33:51.625
Nansen would never have done that.

33:54.291 --> 33:57.375
This was no expedition.

33:58.458 --> 34:00.083
This was panic.

34:00.916 --> 34:05.666
You went out too soon
to gain an advantage on Scott.

34:08.083 --> 34:09.791
I mean...

34:10.750 --> 34:12.500
Scott.

34:16.416 --> 34:19.541
Scott has been preparing
for this for four years.

34:21.666 --> 34:25.375
He will take Shackleton's old
route across the mountain.

34:25.458 --> 34:27.250
While we are here.

34:29.333 --> 34:33.500
In a terrain where nobody ever
have set foot.

34:34.541 --> 34:37.333
We could just as well be
on a different planet.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.916
And so you think-

34:41.000 --> 34:44.166
-that it would be without risk?

34:46.250 --> 34:49.083
Have I been unclear?

34:51.625 --> 34:53.500
Is the situation such-

34:53.541 --> 34:55.708
-that there are someone here-

34:56.291 --> 34:58.250
-who haven't realized-

34:58.333 --> 35:01.500
-what we actually are doing?

35:02.708 --> 35:04.875
- No.
- No.

35:08.625 --> 35:10.625
Because in that case-

35:11.291 --> 35:14.041
-perhaps it could be useful-

35:14.125 --> 35:18.416
- if you told us all,
since you are so concerned with him, -

35:18.500 --> 35:21.166
-what Nansen's motto was-

35:21.791 --> 35:24.500
-as he crossed Greenland?

35:27.666 --> 35:29.458
What was it, -

35:29.500 --> 35:31.291
- Johansen?

35:33.583 --> 35:35.458
"Death..."

35:36.666 --> 35:39.791
"...or Greenland's West Coast."

35:40.375 --> 35:42.125
Yes.

35:42.791 --> 35:45.083
So what do you think ours is?

36:21.333 --> 36:23.166
Johansen.

36:34.375 --> 36:36.166
I have...

36:39.500 --> 36:41.833
You are not going on.

36:44.208 --> 36:47.791
You will chart the area
around King Edward's Land.

36:47.875 --> 36:50.583
Under the command of Presterud.

37:06.583 --> 37:09.250
<i>Why are you telling me this?</i>

37:09.333 --> 37:12.666
<i>So you will learn more
about the man you have a relationship with.</i>

37:14.833 --> 37:18.083
Have you experienced arctic conditions?

37:18.166 --> 37:19.708
No.

37:21.458 --> 37:23.625
Driven a dog sleigh in a blizzard?

37:23.708 --> 37:25.500
How so?

37:26.333 --> 37:28.125
I have.

38:46.041 --> 38:47.750
Are you done?

40:25.166 --> 40:26.833
Wisting!

40:30.000 --> 40:31.541
Come on!

41:55.291 --> 41:56.916
Mount-

41:57.041 --> 41:58.750
- Bjaaland.

42:01.333 --> 42:03.625
Mount Hassel.

42:03.708 --> 42:05.750
Mount Hanssen.

42:06.416 --> 42:08.333
Mount Wisting.

42:12.833 --> 42:14.625
Mount Presterud.

42:17.291 --> 42:19.375
And Mount Johansen.

42:37.666 --> 42:39.875
Yes, let's just-

42:40.000 --> 42:42.458
-get this started.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.583
Shall I begin?

42:58.916 --> 43:01.791
I think that looks very good.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.041
No, thank you.
I'm not all that hungry

43:08.125 --> 43:11.291
Have you seen a man with scurvy, Bjaaland?

43:12.333 --> 43:15.416
First you start to act oddly.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.750
Powerless and tired.

43:17.833 --> 43:19.541
Then-

43:19.625 --> 43:22.250
-you start to bleed from the mouth.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.125
And your teeth fall out.

43:24.208 --> 43:26.833
Then old wounds and breakages-

43:26.916 --> 43:28.875
-start opening again.

43:36.083 --> 43:38.666
And you, Wisting?
You're sitting and...

43:38.750 --> 43:41.208
Sitting and thinking about...?

43:41.833 --> 43:43.208
Just that...

43:43.291 --> 43:45.000
Here we are.

43:45.541 --> 43:48.875
In the world's greatest desolation.
As large as-

43:49.916 --> 43:53.041
- All of North America combined.

43:54.166 --> 43:55.583
And that flame-

43:57.458 --> 44:01.333
- is the only source of heat
on the entire continent.

44:03.375 --> 44:06.125
Except Scott's, that is.

45:23.666 --> 45:25.750
How much further is it?

45:25.833 --> 45:29.750
I think we are very close.
Very, very close.

45:37.125 --> 45:39.791
That seems right according to mine.

45:40.916 --> 45:43.083
What do you have?

45:43.166 --> 45:46.291
Wait a minute, I'll verify.

45:48.041 --> 45:51.125
From what I can see, that is right.

46:23.708 --> 46:25.500
Yes.

46:25.875 --> 46:27.583
But then...

46:28.250 --> 46:30.208
That's what it is.

46:31.541 --> 46:33.625
Come, let's take it now.

46:33.708 --> 46:35.458
We'll take it.

47:05.625 --> 47:07.333
Look towards the flag.

47:15.708 --> 47:18.500
Which direction is North now?

47:18.541 --> 47:21.750
- That way, isn't it?
- No, it is there.

47:21.833 --> 47:24.833
My money is on that way.

47:24.916 --> 47:27.750
It's strange how it is all connected.

47:27.833 --> 47:31.916
And it's probably nobody, ever-

47:32.041 --> 47:37.083
- who's been standing in a spot more diametrically
opposed from what was the original goal.

47:37.166 --> 47:39.416
It's also a little funny.

47:45.250 --> 47:46.916
No, let him go.

48:01.833 --> 48:05.041
I wonder where the englishmen are.

48:08.666 --> 48:10.333
<i>Dear Captain Scott.</i>

48:11.041 --> 48:14.541
<i>As you doubtlessly are the first
who will come here after us, -</i>

48:14.625 --> 48:18.125
<i>- I'm asking you to kindly
forward this letter-</i>

48:18.208 --> 48:20.250
<i>-to King Haakon 7.</i>

48:21.416 --> 48:24.875
<i>If you should have need of any of what
we've left in the tent, -</i>

48:25.041 --> 48:27.791
<i>-you are welcome to have it.</i>

48:29.000 --> 48:32.208
<i>Perhaps you also may have use of the
sleigh that is outside.</i>

48:32.291 --> 48:36.666
<i>With Kind Regards, and
best wishes for a safe return.</i>

48:36.750 --> 48:39.083
Telegram for Amundsen.

48:43.500 --> 48:44.916
Telegram?

48:45.041 --> 48:48.250
- What does it say?
- "Agrbf amgif akr..."

48:48.333 --> 48:50.500
It's a code!

48:54.500 --> 48:56.500
What does it say?

49:00.375 --> 49:02.166
We did it!

49:14.458 --> 49:16.500
Know what, Nicolay?

49:18.166 --> 49:21.875
I've never liked this set.

49:25.916 --> 49:28.500
We can't have worn out porcelain.

49:29.333 --> 49:30.625
Now we can get a new one!

49:30.708 --> 49:33.250
Amundsen on the South Pole!

49:33.625 --> 49:36.166
Amundsen on the South Pole!

49:36.583 --> 49:39.125
Amundsen on the South Pole!

50:27.500 --> 50:29.333
Gentlemen.

50:29.625 --> 50:33.208
We usually don't permit ladies to enter.

50:33.708 --> 50:38.000
But since little Mary has written
such a beautiful poem-

50:38.083 --> 50:41.500
- I figured we could make an exception.

50:48.666 --> 50:54.250
Even if but a simple cross
Marks the grave of these heroic men

50:54.708 --> 50:57.291
Their names will live on for ever

50:57.375 --> 51:00.208
O England, home of the brave!

51:14.583 --> 51:19.791
Captain Scott and his brave men
reached the South Pole on January 17th, -

51:19.875 --> 51:25.041
- only to discover that Mr. Amundsen
had beat them to it.

51:25.916 --> 51:27.916
One can only imagine-

51:28.041 --> 51:29.666
-how betrayed-

51:29.750 --> 51:33.708
- our brave men must have felt
on the way home.

51:34.291 --> 51:36.500
Thanks to Scott's log book-

51:36.583 --> 51:39.333
-we know exactly what happened.

51:39.416 --> 51:44.208
We know that Mr. Amundsen penned a letter
to the King of Norway-

51:44.291 --> 51:49.458
- which he requested that captain Scott
deliver on his behalf.

51:49.500 --> 51:52.916
He mistook our officers for mail men!

51:58.750 --> 52:02.708
Our guest had good fortune on his journey.

52:03.416 --> 52:05.208
Good weather.

52:05.291 --> 52:07.083
Good health.

52:07.166 --> 52:09.833
Transportation that didn't break down.

52:11.333 --> 52:13.541
And we congratulate him with this.

52:13.625 --> 52:15.416
Captain Scott, -

52:15.708 --> 52:18.125
-a true british hero...

52:20.458 --> 52:23.166
Pulled his own sleigh!

52:26.541 --> 52:28.666
It is possible that he lost-

52:29.458 --> 52:33.500
- an unfair battle against
sickness and hunger.

52:34.416 --> 52:37.583
But he refused to resort to barbarism.

52:38.458 --> 52:41.458
He remained a true gentleman-

52:41.500 --> 52:43.666
To the very last.

52:52.708 --> 52:55.500
I thus want to raise a toast.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.458
For the real heroes
on this expedition.

53:05.375 --> 53:06.833
The dogs.

53:06.916 --> 53:09.500
To the dogs!

53:49.250 --> 53:52.708
Are you going to the moon,
Mr. Amundsen?

53:52.791 --> 53:56.791
- Charles Bennett.
- Good to see you, my friend.

53:56.875 --> 53:59.208
You must meet my wife.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.333
One of your fellow countrymen.

54:02.416 --> 54:04.750
Kristine Elisabeth.

54:06.500 --> 54:08.125
Mrs Bennett.

54:08.208 --> 54:10.416
- I'm honored.
- Call me Kiss.

54:10.500 --> 54:13.416
And the honor is all mine, Mr. Amundsen.

54:14.625 --> 54:16.250
Excuse me.

54:16.583 --> 54:21.416
I just have to say that how the british
are treating you is shameful.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.791
And after such a triumph!

54:24.500 --> 54:29.333
It was horrific to hear about
Mr. Scott and his men.

54:30.750 --> 54:32.416
Terrible stroke of bad luck.

54:32.500 --> 54:35.333
And so close to a safe harbor.

54:35.416 --> 54:37.125
When you-

54:37.208 --> 54:39.708
-prepare everything correctly-

54:39.791 --> 54:43.291
- and have everything in order,
it is called luck.

54:43.375 --> 54:48.291
But when you avoid to take
the most mandatory precautions-

54:48.375 --> 54:51.208
- and suffer a defeat,
it is called bad luck.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.625
What do you mean?

54:53.708 --> 54:55.583
Scott.

54:55.666 --> 54:58.291
He was a great scientist.

54:58.375 --> 55:00.625
An excellent sportsman.

55:00.708 --> 55:05.458
But Nansen had told him
that he should use skis and dogs.

55:05.500 --> 55:08.583
Despite this he insisted on-

55:08.666 --> 55:10.833
-machines and ponies.

55:12.041 --> 55:15.500
The British have a need to conquer.

55:15.583 --> 55:19.416
That they do. But you cannot
conquer nature.

55:21.166 --> 55:23.666
You just can't.

55:25.500 --> 55:26.875
You just have to-

55:27.000 --> 55:29.708
-play along.

55:35.291 --> 55:38.208
He's got a weakness for married women.

55:39.041 --> 55:40.458
Are you?

55:40.500 --> 55:42.291
Married?

55:42.583 --> 55:44.500
Yes.

55:45.875 --> 55:47.583
I know about Kiss.

55:48.208 --> 55:50.833
And there have been others.
So what?

55:50.916 --> 55:52.875
We are both adults.

55:56.625 --> 56:00.875
Do you think Roald would forgive us
if we tasted-

56:01.000 --> 56:03.875
-one of the bottles from the South Pole?

56:11.916 --> 56:14.916
Do you know who owns this house?

56:19.166 --> 56:21.791
The one that needs it the least.

56:29.541 --> 56:33.375
- Congratulations, Amundsen!
- Look over here, please!

56:43.791 --> 56:45.541
<i>Kiss.</i>

56:47.000 --> 56:48.333
<i>Kiss.</i>

56:50.291 --> 56:52.208
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

57:00.041 --> 57:03.583
Honorable Roald Amundsen.

57:05.500 --> 57:07.291
We Norwegians-

57:07.375 --> 57:09.000
-are proud-

57:09.083 --> 57:13.250
- that you have planted
the Norwegian Flag on the South Pole.

57:13.333 --> 57:15.500
Ahead of the English!

57:17.583 --> 57:19.875
It is impossible to realize-

57:20.000 --> 57:23.500
- what this incredible feat
has cost in sacrifice, -

57:23.583 --> 57:26.583
-endurance, and heroic courage.

57:29.541 --> 57:32.500
In this triumph
you shall be forgiven for forgetting-

57:32.541 --> 57:37.250
- that the South Pole was not the
real goal. Just a step on the way.

57:38.625 --> 57:41.291
But Amundsen is a man of is word.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.166
Next year it's time for the Bering Strait.

57:45.250 --> 57:47.333
In to ice.

57:47.416 --> 57:48.916
And cold.

57:49.041 --> 57:50.625
And darkness.

57:50.708 --> 57:53.291
To research the polar currents-

57:53.375 --> 57:56.333
-and drift in over the North Pole.

57:57.458 --> 57:59.500
For at least five years!

58:04.083 --> 58:07.791
It may seem to be almost supernatural.

58:07.875 --> 58:09.666
But Amundsen-

58:09.750 --> 58:12.500
-is man for that as well.

58:13.583 --> 58:15.041
Hooray!

58:15.833 --> 58:17.250
Hooray!

58:18.375 --> 58:20.000
Hooray!

58:31.291 --> 58:35.125
Nansen has a theory that
if I let the boat get frozen in the ice, -

58:35.208 --> 58:37.750
- I can drift the entire way to the Pole.

58:37.833 --> 58:40.916
And what happens at the
North- and South Pole-

58:41.041 --> 58:44.125
- is crucial for the climate
all over the globe.

58:44.208 --> 58:46.041
This is not what you want to do now.

58:46.125 --> 58:50.833
But this was the condition for me
being allowed to borrow Fram.

58:50.916 --> 58:53.625
I did not think he would
hold me to it.

58:53.708 --> 58:55.916
No.
Five years in the ice...

58:56.041 --> 58:58.666
We don't need to care about that.

58:59.250 --> 59:01.666
It means nothing to us.

59:03.208 --> 59:05.125
When we think about each other-

59:05.208 --> 59:07.375
-it's like we are together.

59:09.041 --> 59:10.750
I feel you.

59:13.291 --> 59:14.916
I feel you.

59:22.500 --> 59:24.208
I feel you.

59:25.916 --> 59:27.750
Right?

59:29.166 --> 59:33.625
We have our unwired conversation.
Nobody can take that away from us.

59:38.125 --> 59:39.875
You...

59:40.583 --> 59:42.333
You are mine, you know.

59:42.833 --> 59:44.750
You are mine, mine, mine.

59:49.125 --> 59:52.666
You will always feel
that I am with you.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.666
Always.

59:57.541 --> 01:00:01.458
<i>Roald was forced to
prove Nansen's theory.</i>

01:00:01.833 --> 01:00:06.833
<i>That it was possible to drift with the
polar ice all the way to the North Pole.</i>

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.708
<i>So he-</i>

01:00:09.791 --> 01:00:12.166
<i>-ordered a new ship.</i>

01:00:12.666 --> 01:00:16.791
<i>Special order for the mission,
called Maud.</i>

01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:19.375
<i>That ship-</i>

01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:22.750
<i>-cost a lot more money than we had.</i>

01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:27.500
<i>Only a sensational triumph
could have saved us from bankruptcy.</i>

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.416
<i>And it turned out-</i>

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.500
<i>- that drifting to the North Pole
takes a long time.</i>

01:00:33.541 --> 01:00:35.666
<i>Very long time.</i>

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500
<i>Five months-</i>

01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:41.500
<i>-until sunrise.</i>

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.708
We have to get out and hack at the
ice so the boat won't be crushed.

01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:08.375
- Does it look ok now, captain?
- No, we need more. It's here.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:09.750
It is here the whole...

01:02:12.625 --> 01:02:14.375
Captain!

01:02:15.208 --> 01:02:16.875
Captain!

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.708
Wisting, come here!

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:19.500
Yes...

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:14.416
BjÃ¸rn!

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:19.375
BjÃ¸rn!

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:22.500
BjÃ¸rn!

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:41.083
- Perhaps you want some of this?
- No, just wrap it up.

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:48.000
I'd like some.

01:04:57.583 --> 01:04:59.916
This will be fine.

01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:41.375
Captain?

01:05:42.416 --> 01:05:44.291
Handsome mustache.

01:05:44.791 --> 01:05:46.708
I'm doing it.

01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:48.541
Tessem-

01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:51.833
-wants to leave the expedition.

01:05:52.458 --> 01:05:55.125
The headache won't let up.

01:05:55.833 --> 01:05:58.791
He still barely can sleep.

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:07.708
How far until the telegraph station
at Dickson Island?

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:10.375
About 70 miles.

01:06:13.208 --> 01:06:14.750
That's not doable.

01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:19.666
Knudsen has offered to
accompany him.

01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:33.666
Tessem?

01:06:34.833 --> 01:06:39.750
We need to send a load of
mail to people at home.

01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:43.625
I'd like to ask you whether
you could take care of that?

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.083
Yes, captain.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.500
You take Knudsen-

01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:52.791
- and you can have a dog sled
and you'll be there in four weeks.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.208
<i>You know...</i>

01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:08.166
<i>It does something to a man.</i>

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:11.500
Being trapped in the ice for so long.

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:16.791
What do you mean?

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:24.000
Well, I bid you welcome.

01:07:27.666 --> 01:07:30.000
Oh, look!

01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:04.500
<i>I feel you have been quiet
for a long while now.</i>

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:11.208
I'm walking around here having
small talk with you, you know.

01:08:11.666 --> 01:08:13.500
Now you have to answer.

01:08:21.332 --> 01:08:24.082
I have transfered the property.

01:08:26.082 --> 01:08:28.332
Villa Uranienborg.

01:08:28.416 --> 01:08:30.291
To you.

01:08:34.207 --> 01:08:37.541
So I will know that you
always will have a home.

01:08:38.832 --> 01:08:41.000
No matter what happens.

01:09:59.041 --> 01:10:01.625
- What's going on?
- Sssh!

01:10:30.083 --> 01:10:31.833
Please.

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.250
Sverdrup, get the medical kit.

01:10:59.041 --> 01:11:00.833
Codliver oil is never wrong.

01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:05.125
Was it tasty?

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.833
This is so delicious.

01:11:12.916 --> 01:11:16.416
I think we just have to taste
it at once.

01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:20.708
Would you like some of this too?
Then let's do that.

01:11:24.458 --> 01:11:26.083
No, no!

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:34.083
No, no, no!

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:43.500
Look.

01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:48.791
Here are more playmates, ok.

01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:51.541
This is a very...

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:54.166
A very special person.

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:55.541
What is it?

01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:58.291
Her father wants us to take her to Norway.

01:11:58.375 --> 01:12:00.083
To get an education.

01:12:00.166 --> 01:12:02.041
Yes, but...

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:05.083
We can't take them all.

01:12:05.166 --> 01:12:07.875
Kakonita has no parents.
It will be something completely different.

01:12:08.041 --> 01:12:11.666
We can't start doing that.
I mean...

01:12:26.916 --> 01:12:30.416
I think we have to break out
the film from the South Pole tonight.

01:12:39.041 --> 01:12:42.500
Those are penguins.
They can't fly.

01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:43.875
They just walk around.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.375
Let's see if it wants the pipe.

01:12:46.458 --> 01:12:48.541
It does not want the pipe.

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:52.166
I'm thinking about when
Kiss gets to meet these.

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:54.625
We'll be like a little family.

01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:56.458
That we will.

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:10.458
It's clear that Nansen is right
about the current theory. Absolutely.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.500
It's just that-

01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:14.541
-five years in the ice-

01:13:15.166 --> 01:13:17.583
-is far too optimistic.

01:13:17.666 --> 01:13:20.083
<i>The expedition took too long.</i>

01:13:20.166 --> 01:13:22.541
<i>And Roald lost his focus.</i>

01:13:22.625 --> 01:13:27.500
<i>He started to consider other ways
to reach the North Pole.</i>

01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:38.416
We have to, you know.

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.500
We have to.

01:13:43.708 --> 01:13:46.458
If there's a land up there.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:50.416
With people.
With.. well, a society.

01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:55.500
We have to get to the North Pole.
See it with our own eyes.

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:57.250
Girls!

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.166
<i>And then he just left.</i>

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:05.166
<i>And made Wisting captain.</i>

01:14:09.666 --> 01:14:13.208
<i>We had put all our money
in that ship.</i>

01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:14.666
<i>Everything.</i>

01:14:15.541 --> 01:14:20.500
We know nothing about
this huge white area.

01:14:20.583 --> 01:14:24.000
2.5 million square kilometers-

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:26.333
-of ice-covered polar ocean.

01:14:26.416 --> 01:14:28.083
That's why we shall-

01:14:28.916 --> 01:14:31.125
-fly there.

01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:35.041
We will be the first to look down at
the last place on this earth-

01:14:35.125 --> 01:14:38.750
-which has resisted every attempt-

01:14:38.833 --> 01:14:40.666
-at discovery.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:43.625
There are of course no guarantees-

01:14:43.708 --> 01:14:47.375
- that we will find a
hidden continent up there.

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:49.166
But if we do, -

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:54.750
- it will be one of the most
significant discoveries-

01:14:54.833 --> 01:14:57.333
-in the entire history of the world.

01:14:58.291 --> 01:15:02.291
He got a hold of two Junker-planes.
Named them Kristine and Elisabeth.

01:15:02.375 --> 01:15:04.750
You know how that turned out.

01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:08.000
They flew 30 meters.

01:15:09.541 --> 01:15:12.500
Planes to a price of 80 000 US dollars.

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:15.083
Abandoned in the snow.

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:19.500
He...

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.875
He lost it.
There's no other way to put it.

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:28.375
You don't know him.

01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:30.416
I beg your pardon?

01:15:31.333 --> 01:15:33.833
I mean,
you knew him once.

01:15:33.916 --> 01:15:35.333
But not now.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.083
I think I know my brother
better than anybody else.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:43.000
I was there.

01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:46.041
That is where we met.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.500
In Alaska.

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:50.541
In Deering.

01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:54.166
He didn't strike me as irrational.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.833
Quite the contrary.

01:15:55.916 --> 01:15:58.333
You haven't heard the entire story.

01:16:03.708 --> 01:16:05.500
Aline?

01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:18.291
Hi.
My name is Engelbregt Gravning.

01:16:18.375 --> 01:16:21.250
We just wanted to drop by to say-

01:16:21.333 --> 01:16:24.791
- that we are moving in
to the house next door.

01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:27.625
So that was...

01:16:32.833 --> 01:16:35.500
Wow.
And here are more children.

01:16:36.833 --> 01:16:40.041
Hi!
You have grown a lot now.

01:16:40.125 --> 01:16:43.791
You'll have to say hello to
two very nice girls.

01:16:45.916 --> 01:16:51.041
I'm getting the girls to school,
then you'll see. They are smart.

01:16:52.625 --> 01:16:54.500
Wow!

01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:57.166
All the way from America.

01:16:57.875 --> 01:17:00.791
So let's say goodbye, uncle Leon.

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:03.625
- Goodbye.
- Thank you for today.

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:20.333
<i>I was worried about
what he was thinking.</i>

01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:26.041
<i>He continued his hopeless relationship with
Kiss, who lived in London with her husband.</i>

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:30.333
<i>And he continued to spend money
we didn't have.</i>

01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:40.208
Roald?

01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:43.708
Look at this.
Such clever girls.

01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:46.000
If we can get them into
school, people will see.

01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:48.375
Can we talk?

01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:50.125
- Now?
- Yes.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:11.708
It's so nice with dogs.
They don't read the papers.

01:18:11.791 --> 01:18:16.208
You had to beat them, didn't you?
When you were out there?

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:20.458
Do you mean that we should have
done the same with the journalists?

01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:24.833
Greenland Dogs are almost wild animals.

01:18:24.916 --> 01:18:28.500
It was brutal and horrific down there,
but that was the way it had to be.

01:18:28.583 --> 01:18:31.916
I know you have ordered three new planes.

01:18:34.416 --> 01:18:36.083
I was going to tell you.

01:18:36.166 --> 01:18:38.708
You can't do that.
You have to cancel the purchase.

01:18:39.625 --> 01:18:42.333
Do you really wish to fly once more?

01:18:42.416 --> 01:18:43.833
Considering how things
turned out last time?

01:18:43.916 --> 01:18:48.000
- That was bad luck. The undercarriage...
- Now you're talking about luck?

01:18:48.083 --> 01:18:52.541
What were you thinking, with those small
planes? That isn't science any longer.

01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:54.000
It is-

01:18:54.083 --> 01:18:55.708
-sports.

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:57.541
Mortally dangerous.

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.583
You didn't mind sports so much
when you were making money off of it.

01:18:59.708 --> 01:19:02.916
- With the South Pole we had no choice.
- I don't have one now either.

01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:05.666
I'm getting old, Leon.

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:08.125
I don't have the time to do things
Nansen's way now.

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:11.916
Even Nansen don't have the time to
do things Nansen's way.

01:19:12.041 --> 01:19:14.500
Somebody will fly to the North Pole.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:18.166
The only question is who
will get there first.

01:19:20.208 --> 01:19:22.166
Those planes were way too small.

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:25.166
We need something much larger,
and we can get that.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.041
Come!

01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:44.125
I have...

01:19:45.208 --> 01:19:47.416
Always, for as long as I can remember, -

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:50.833
- I've been following you
from one room to the next.

01:19:53.375 --> 01:19:57.875
I cannot remember even a single time
you came to me.

01:19:58.625 --> 01:20:00.416
Can you?

01:20:02.625 --> 01:20:05.041
What are you talking about?

01:20:06.583 --> 01:20:10.291
I don't mind living in the
shadow of Roald Amundsen.

01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:13.666
But not when you keep
things secret from me.

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:15.416
Putting other people's lives at risk.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.916
Not a single life
has been lost under my command.

01:20:18.041 --> 01:20:20.166
Depends on how you figure.

01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:24.083
You still owe 20 000 USD
on the last planes you purchased.

01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:26.291
Are you aware?

01:20:26.375 --> 01:20:27.666
No.

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:29.916
And now you have purchased new ones?

01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:33.500
We don't have that money.
I can't get any more.

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:37.500
I have already loaned you
100 000 kroner from my own pocket.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:39.916
And then you transfer our properties
to Kiss?

01:20:40.041 --> 01:20:43.666
Because it is important to me
that she should have a home.

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:47.875
She is one of the richest women
in all of England!

01:20:54.625 --> 01:20:57.333
I've got a family to consider.

01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:04.000
Strictly speaking so does Kiss
Bennett too, right?

01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:10.250
I don't recognize you any longer.

01:21:12.291 --> 01:21:14.208
Nobody does.

01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:18.500
What kind of captain leaves Maud
and the expedition, -

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:22.708
- comes home with two innocent children
and lies to me?

01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:24.666
Yes, I lie.

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:30.708
I do do that, Leon.

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:33.833
What did you think?

01:21:34.458 --> 01:21:36.625
That I told you everything?

01:21:36.708 --> 01:21:38.083
Like before?

01:21:40.166 --> 01:21:43.208
What would happen then, Leon?

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.666
Hm?

01:21:48.083 --> 01:21:50.583
What would I have accomplished-

01:21:50.666 --> 01:21:52.333
-if I did that?

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:55.500
Nothing.

01:21:56.375 --> 01:21:58.583
You just would have said no.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.416
You don't dare any longer.

01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:07.833
You have become cowardly.

01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:13.916
I...

01:22:16.166 --> 01:22:19.791
I am afraid I can't do
your finances any longer.

01:22:19.875 --> 01:22:22.916
I will sign away all mandates.

01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:26.416
Find somebody else to handle it.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:31.166
Tell me who, and I'll send you a
bill on the money you owe.

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:39.375
Leon!

01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:46.500
<i>And-</i>

01:22:46.541 --> 01:22:49.416
<i>-that was the last time I saw him.</i>

01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:52.833
Hi!

01:22:55.333 --> 01:22:58.125
Roald didn't listen to me, of course, -

01:22:58.208 --> 01:23:00.875
-and ordered those planes anyway.

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:05.666
Now he is bankrupt,
and missing.

01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:11.250
You sound almost satisfied.

01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:15.625
It was a tragedy.

01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:19.458
Shameful.

01:23:19.875 --> 01:23:21.583
He had nobody.

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:26.333
The bankruptcy almost killed him.

01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:33.166
Do you know anybody else
who could have come back from that?

01:23:36.625 --> 01:23:38.500
It is just money, Leon.

01:23:39.083 --> 01:23:41.541
What do you mean?
It is not just money.

01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:42.916
He risks everything-

01:23:43.083 --> 01:23:45.625
- to do what
nobody have done before him.

01:23:45.708 --> 01:23:47.125
And you-

01:23:47.208 --> 01:23:49.500
-talk about a house?

01:23:57.166 --> 01:24:02.458
Perhaps he gave you the impression that he
was, but my brother is not the victim here.

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:06.791
There were several victims.

01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.291
Yes.
Hjalmar.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.500
Not just Hjalmar.
There were more.

01:24:16.375 --> 01:24:21.041
Parts of the crew.
The Maud expedition lasted for seven years.

01:24:22.708 --> 01:24:24.500
Seven.

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:29.333
During that period
several people just left.

01:24:29.416 --> 01:24:30.708
Or disappeared.

01:24:30.791 --> 01:24:33.500
What do you mean they disappeared?

01:24:33.541 --> 01:24:35.791
Tessem and Knudsen.

01:24:35.875 --> 01:24:40.375
It was 800 kilometers from Maud
to the mainland. They never arrived.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:45.500
<i>Some campfire remains were found.</i>

01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:48.750
<i>And charred bones.</i>

01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:54.875
Either Tessem or Knudsen had died.
The other one had cremated the body.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.250
<i>Later on a mummified corpse
was found on the mainland.</i>

01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:01.458
<i>Right by Dickson Island.</i>

01:25:02.166 --> 01:25:06.333
<i>He died only three kilometers
from the weather station.</i>

01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:10.541
<i>He saw the lights from it as he fell.</i>

01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:13.208
He died from exhaustion.

01:25:13.291 --> 01:25:17.541
Meanwhile Roald was bathing
in luxurious hotels and flew around and...

01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:20.041
He was stuck in the ice for three years!

01:25:20.125 --> 01:25:22.375
Sverdrup, Olonkin and Wisting-

01:25:22.458 --> 01:25:24.708
-remained on Maud for seven years.

01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:29.375
The entire time, until the ship was
seized due to Roald's bankruptcy.

01:25:31.125 --> 01:25:33.000
<i>You know-</i>

01:25:33.083 --> 01:25:35.083
<i>- Wisting?</i>

01:25:35.166 --> 01:25:37.416
<i>He had seven children.</i>

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:41.375
<i>Three got sick and died
while he was stuck in the ice.</i>

01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:46.500
<i>And still he remained loyal
to his captain.</i>

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:51.333
<i>He refused to let the lenders
seize the ship.</i>

01:25:55.666 --> 01:25:57.458
They were grown men.

01:25:58.833 --> 01:26:01.166
They knew what they were doing.

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:03.333
And then there was the two girls.

01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:05.291
He loves them.

01:26:06.083 --> 01:26:07.833
He sent them away, Bess.

01:26:07.916 --> 01:26:09.541
He had to.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.500
There is something I
think you should know of.

01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:18.375
Roald told me of a letter.

01:26:18.458 --> 01:26:19.833
From Kiss.

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.375
<i>He waited for her.</i>

01:26:23.875 --> 01:26:25.791
<i>With the girls.</i>

01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:28.291
<i>She ended it.</i>

01:26:30.583 --> 01:26:32.750
<i>He had no choice.</i>

01:26:33.166 --> 01:26:35.583
<i>He had to send them off.</i>

01:26:36.541 --> 01:26:40.333
<i>Who do you think took care
of the girls while he was away?</i>

01:26:40.416 --> 01:26:44.166
<i>It was mostly us.
He didn't care.</i>

01:26:44.916 --> 01:26:47.666
<i>They went to school here for two years.</i>

01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:52.416
<i>Then he sent them back to Siberia.</i>

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.916
Who does that?

01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:57.416
You twist the truth.

01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:00.166
Do you see that banner behind me?
Everything for Norway?

01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:02.375
It should say "Everything for Roald".

01:27:02.458 --> 01:27:05.041
He only cares about -one-thing.

01:27:05.125 --> 01:27:06.500
The North Pole.

01:27:07.083 --> 01:27:08.791
Himself.

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:11.458
He is your brother.

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.666
He's out there somewhere.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:21.416
You should pray for him.

01:27:23.875 --> 01:27:26.583
I am sure he's pleased now.

01:27:28.125 --> 01:27:31.875
Dying a martyr's death
along with his men, -

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.541
- like in the foolish adventure books
we used to read.

01:27:39.583 --> 01:27:42.208
I don't understand you.

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:47.208
Why are you so angry?

01:27:47.291 --> 01:27:51.500
- I have told you.
- You claim that you hate him.

01:27:54.083 --> 01:27:56.291
Still you're sitting here.

01:28:02.625 --> 01:28:06.000
You were waiting for him to return.

01:28:08.791 --> 01:28:10.541
Right?

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.750
You're waiting.

01:28:20.541 --> 01:28:23.625
That's why you're sticking around.

01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:29.000
That's why you're still living nearby.

01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:37.208
You're angry with him for
getting by without you.

01:28:37.291 --> 01:28:38.708
Nonsense.

01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:41.541
You're angry with him
because if not for Roald, -

01:28:41.666 --> 01:28:45.208
- you would have been importing wine
or something like it.

01:28:45.291 --> 01:28:48.791
And he would still have become historic.

01:28:50.875 --> 01:28:52.541
With or without you.

01:28:52.625 --> 01:28:55.541
I don't need to listen to this.

01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:11.333
Dietrichson?

01:30:11.416 --> 01:30:12.708
Riiser-Larsen?

01:30:12.791 --> 01:30:15.833
Ellsworth and Feucht?
Come here.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.458
Enough now.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.375
It is enough.

01:30:36.583 --> 01:30:39.083
We have done what we can.

01:30:41.291 --> 01:30:43.041
And you-

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.500
- have done more
than I could ever have asked of you.

01:30:52.791 --> 01:30:55.041
We have tried for weeks now-

01:30:55.125 --> 01:30:57.166
-to prepare a runway.

01:30:57.250 --> 01:31:01.125
And what we have now
isn't anywhere near long enough.

01:31:01.875 --> 01:31:04.416
But we have no more food.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.333
So it will have to do.

01:31:07.625 --> 01:31:10.500
We didn't reach the North Pole, -

01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:13.333
-but we are getting home.

01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:22.000
I've been in this kind of situation before,
and it has ended well.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.833
It is what it is.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.750
Amundsen.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:03.833
They love you even more
now that you have risen from the dead.

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.166
Good to see you again.

01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:19.000
Impressive!

01:34:19.625 --> 01:34:23.916
Congratulations, Mr. Amundsen.
We were expecting the worst.

01:34:25.083 --> 01:34:26.833
See you soon.

01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:36.000
Captain!

01:34:39.791 --> 01:34:42.250
A few grey hairs since last time!

01:34:44.333 --> 01:34:45.666
Just keep in mind...

01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:48.458
I am a married woman.
I shall be discrete.

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.541
You can talk more later.

01:34:50.625 --> 01:34:52.708
This was...

01:34:53.666 --> 01:34:55.416
This was special.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.000
We'll take...

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:16.833
You look good for a dead man.

01:35:16.916 --> 01:35:18.333
Captain.

01:35:20.333 --> 01:35:22.250
How...?

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.625
It is-

01:35:32.333 --> 01:35:34.250
-good to have you here.

01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:42.000
- My sincere congratulations!
- Thank you.

01:35:42.083 --> 01:35:44.583
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:47.458
Thank you, thank you.

01:35:53.708 --> 01:35:55.333
We should go.

01:35:57.208 --> 01:35:58.875
Tell me, -

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.625
-does Kiss still own all this?

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:05.791
You shouldn't listen to my brother.

01:36:05.875 --> 01:36:09.000
He doesn't understand people like us.

01:36:09.083 --> 01:36:10.791
He lives in a small world.

01:36:10.875 --> 01:36:13.416
And if it's a matter of money...

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:16.416
I will get money.
Guaranteed.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:20.541
I will write a book.
You saw my accolades there.

01:36:20.625 --> 01:36:24.208
Do you really think I care about money?

01:36:25.166 --> 01:36:28.500
Do you think that is
what this is about?

01:36:33.166 --> 01:36:35.083
I...

01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:41.583
I want to say something.

01:36:50.166 --> 01:36:53.250
It has always been easier for me-

01:36:53.666 --> 01:36:55.375
-than everybody else.

01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:58.291
To be alone out there.

01:36:59.541 --> 01:37:01.416
To me-

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:04.708
-it is simply beautiful.

01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:08.750
But this time-

01:37:08.833 --> 01:37:10.666
I was scared.

01:37:15.416 --> 01:37:16.875
I feared-

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.458
-that I would never see you-

01:37:20.166 --> 01:37:22.041
-again.

01:37:33.041 --> 01:37:36.500
You have started something
you have to finish.

01:37:38.375 --> 01:37:40.291
I understand.

01:37:43.416 --> 01:37:45.875
And when you have...

01:37:47.166 --> 01:37:51.333
When you have seen
what lies beyond the North Pole...

01:37:52.916 --> 01:37:55.416
I want to marry you.

01:37:59.333 --> 01:38:01.583
But if I do...

01:38:02.125 --> 01:38:04.625
If I file for a divorce...

01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:08.500
Promise me-

01:38:09.916 --> 01:38:12.375
-that no matter what we do, -

01:38:13.666 --> 01:38:15.916
-we do it together.

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:19.500
I promise.

01:38:22.125 --> 01:38:23.875
I promise.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.208
There is an-

01:38:29.875 --> 01:38:31.250
- Italian engineer.

01:38:31.333 --> 01:38:32.791
He has built-

01:38:33.875 --> 01:38:35.666
-a dirigible.

01:38:36.333 --> 01:38:40.458
It is a lot safer.
Like sitting in an armchair.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:45.208
But Mussolini wants it to be
an Italian expedition.

01:38:45.833 --> 01:38:48.375
With me on board.
Can you imagine?

01:38:48.458 --> 01:38:50.166
So you...
Wait.

01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:52.041
Quiet.

01:38:52.458 --> 01:38:55.166
You aim to reach the North Pole-

01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:56.875
-in an armchair?

01:38:57.625 --> 01:39:01.208
- I am old.
- I have noticed.

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.791
Do you think I'll find it?

01:39:09.875 --> 01:39:11.250
Up there?

01:39:11.333 --> 01:39:12.625
Yes.

01:39:13.083 --> 01:39:16.125
You have dreamt about
this your entire life.

01:39:18.583 --> 01:39:20.708
You have never given up.

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:26.375
Most people abandon their dreams.

01:39:26.458 --> 01:39:28.250
Let them die.

01:39:29.166 --> 01:39:30.791
But not you.

01:39:34.416 --> 01:39:37.125
And you dream larger than everybody else.

01:39:40.458 --> 01:39:43.666
You will find
what you are looking for.

01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:45.583
I know you will.

01:39:49.125 --> 01:39:50.791
And...

01:39:51.708 --> 01:39:54.458
And...

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.333
Somebody have to-

01:40:08.291 --> 01:40:12.333
- find out whether Santa Claus
is actually living up there.

01:40:18.125 --> 01:40:19.458
Yes.

01:40:29.791 --> 01:40:33.791
But I refuse to sail
under an Italian flag.

01:41:34.041 --> 01:41:37.500
Captain,
we are only minutes away.

01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:41.541
Have you seen anything?

01:41:41.625 --> 01:41:43.708
No, only ice.

01:41:59.875 --> 01:42:01.625
Captain?

01:42:04.041 --> 01:42:06.083
Are we there?

01:42:06.166 --> 01:42:07.916
Mhm.

01:42:21.541 --> 01:42:23.208
Everybody?

01:42:23.291 --> 01:42:27.333
Time is 22 minutes past midnight.

01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:30.625
May 12.

01:42:30.708 --> 01:42:33.458
1926.

01:42:35.375 --> 01:42:38.416
And we have reached the North Pole.

01:42:39.458 --> 01:42:40.750
Congratulations.

01:42:40.833 --> 01:42:42.583
Ellsworth.

01:42:42.666 --> 01:42:44.458
Nobile.

01:43:06.416 --> 01:43:11.541
Mr. Nobile, do you think you could have
done this without captain Amundsen?

01:43:11.625 --> 01:43:13.583
Amundsen is a great explorer.

01:43:13.666 --> 01:43:16.125
But this is an Italian dirigible.

01:43:16.208 --> 01:43:19.500
With Italian technology
and financing.

01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:23.375
Because of this I am planning
a new expedition with the dirigible Italy.

01:43:23.458 --> 01:43:25.875
Where I shall be captain.

01:44:22.166 --> 01:44:25.833
I was there on board the dirigible, -

01:44:26.666 --> 01:44:29.291
- with the Italian
and that fucking dog...

01:44:29.375 --> 01:44:31.541
And then suddenly...

01:44:33.083 --> 01:44:35.458
Suddenly it was-

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.291
-over.

01:44:41.625 --> 01:44:43.458
It was done.

01:44:44.166 --> 01:44:45.625
Finished.

01:44:47.708 --> 01:44:51.541
There were no
more white spots on the map.

01:44:52.833 --> 01:44:55.666
You are much more than that, Roald.

01:44:56.541 --> 01:44:59.250
There is much left.

01:44:59.333 --> 01:45:01.083
In medicine.

01:45:01.541 --> 01:45:03.375
Technology.

01:45:04.166 --> 01:45:06.000
In politics.

01:45:12.541 --> 01:45:15.166
I hear that you are writing a book.

01:45:16.541 --> 01:45:18.166
Who's told you that?

01:45:19.208 --> 01:45:21.500
Somebody who cares about you.

01:45:21.583 --> 01:45:23.375
Wisting?

01:45:23.458 --> 01:45:26.208
He said that you may be angry-

01:45:26.291 --> 01:45:27.916
-at the English.

01:45:28.041 --> 01:45:29.791
At Nobile.

01:45:29.875 --> 01:45:32.208
Even at your own brother.

01:45:32.291 --> 01:45:33.875
And then I simply thought:

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.125
Is there any worse time
to write an autobiography?

01:45:38.208 --> 01:45:43.166
Fridtjof Nansen. Always ready to
help anybody.

01:45:44.125 --> 01:45:46.250
What shall it be called?

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.833
- "My life as a polar researcher"
- Polar researcher?

01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:06.041
But consider what I said.

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:11.458
We are still dependant on having
a good relationship with the English.

01:46:19.708 --> 01:46:21.708
It is my experience-

01:46:22.750 --> 01:46:26.875
- that the english
by and large-

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.041
-are a race of poor losers.

01:46:29.125 --> 01:46:32.208
It is precisely this I'm
talking about, Roald.

01:46:32.291 --> 01:46:35.333
If I could have one wish,
do you know what it'd be?

01:46:35.458 --> 01:46:37.750
That Scott returned alive.

01:46:37.833 --> 01:46:41.166
Then he would be number two.
The man that lost.

01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:44.583
Instead they martyred him,
and me-

01:46:44.666 --> 01:46:47.291
-they made the bad guy who beat him.

01:46:47.916 --> 01:46:50.625
I won, but I became the bad guy.

01:46:50.708 --> 01:46:56.833
I, who have lived my life according
to the strictest code of honor, always.

01:46:58.166 --> 01:47:00.250
I planned the South Pole so thoroughly-

01:47:00.333 --> 01:47:02.666
-that it looked easy, you know.

01:47:03.166 --> 01:47:06.250
That is the stupidest I've ever done.

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.833
A book-

01:47:11.916 --> 01:47:14.000
-is for ever.

01:47:38.541 --> 01:47:40.375
<i>Leon?</i>

01:47:43.208 --> 01:47:44.916
<i>Leon?</i>

01:47:53.375 --> 01:47:55.583
Have you finished reading?

01:47:55.666 --> 01:47:57.416
Yes.

01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:04.250
He's barking at everything and everybody.

01:48:08.083 --> 01:48:10.000
The English.
Scott.

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.791
Nobile.

01:48:12.875 --> 01:48:16.625
The Hardanger plain,
where I saved his life.

01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:22.041
"I was practically encased
in a block of ice."

01:48:22.125 --> 01:48:26.166
"Desperately I fought to free myself,
but without the faintest result."

01:48:26.666 --> 01:48:28.416
"I shouted for my-

01:48:29.166 --> 01:48:30.833
-companion..."

01:48:35.125 --> 01:48:39.375
That is everything that's left of me.
An anonymous companion.

01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.625
My dear, are you crying?

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.916
<i>The first to spend the winter
in Antarctica.</i>

01:49:00.041 --> 01:49:02.708
<i>The first
through the Northwest Passage.</i>

01:49:02.791 --> 01:49:04.208
<i>The first on the South Pole.</i>

01:49:04.291 --> 01:49:08.750
<i>The first to sail across the
entire Arctic Ocean.</i>

01:49:08.833 --> 01:49:13.916
<i>The first to sail through both
the Northwest and the Northeast Passage.</i>

01:49:14.041 --> 01:49:15.375
<i>And the crowning achievment:</i>

01:49:15.458 --> 01:49:18.625
<i>The first one to fly over the Arctic, -</i>

01:49:18.708 --> 01:49:20.708
<i>-between the North Pole and Alaska.</i>

01:49:20.791 --> 01:49:23.500
<i>And in so doing,
the first on both poles.</i>

01:49:23.541 --> 01:49:24.875
<i>Simply put:</i>

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
The greatest polar explorer-

01:49:27.083 --> 01:49:28.791
-throughout the ages!

01:49:56.666 --> 01:49:58.375
Wisting?

01:49:58.458 --> 01:50:00.250
Captain?

01:50:00.875 --> 01:50:02.750
Nansen.

01:50:03.416 --> 01:50:05.416
Where is he?

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:09.666
- And the King and Queen?
- They had to cancel, unfortunately.

01:50:10.208 --> 01:50:12.750
Because of that fucking book.
I knew it.

01:50:14.166 --> 01:50:16.291
Bess isn't here either.

01:50:17.666 --> 01:50:20.416
She will be here before long.

01:50:43.291 --> 01:50:45.083
As you know, the-

01:50:45.166 --> 01:50:49.666
- Umberto Nobile is out
on a new expedition in the Arctic.

01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:52.541
But the dirigible is now missing.

01:50:53.333 --> 01:50:55.791
A hurricane has struck-

01:50:55.875 --> 01:50:58.041
-the west coast of Spitsbergen.

01:50:58.125 --> 01:51:01.250
And has probably forced the ship east.

01:51:01.333 --> 01:51:03.375
The rescue mission will
have to be done by plane.

01:51:03.458 --> 01:51:06.333
No aeroplane has however ever succeeded-

01:51:06.416 --> 01:51:09.083
-in crossing this stretch.

01:51:09.583 --> 01:51:12.125
I shall be the first.

01:51:12.208 --> 01:51:15.375
Mr. Amundsen,
everybody here would like to know, -

01:51:15.458 --> 01:51:18.250
- both international guests
as well as Norwegians...

01:51:18.333 --> 01:51:21.666
Are you going to participate
in the search for Nobile?

01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:23.791
Yes.

01:51:23.875 --> 01:51:25.500
Immediately.

01:51:25.583 --> 01:51:27.291
Amundsen?

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.333
Amundsen?

01:52:20.458 --> 01:52:22.791
Congratulations.
That was...

01:52:27.333 --> 01:52:29.083
Bess Magids.

01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.041
Amundsen.

01:52:32.125 --> 01:52:34.416
Captain Amundsen.

01:52:36.666 --> 01:52:38.833
So, captain.

01:52:38.916 --> 01:52:40.791
Do you play poker?

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.250
What happened?

01:55:24.291 --> 01:55:26.166
He is gone, Bess.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.666
He...

01:55:29.916 --> 01:55:34.500
Nobile was missing,
and Roald took a plane to find him.

01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:37.125
Why?

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.750
The plane crashed.

01:55:41.833 --> 01:55:43.833
Somewhere.

01:55:58.666 --> 01:56:00.708
I am so sorry.

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.625
I should have been there.

01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:07.416
I could have stopped him.

01:56:16.833 --> 01:56:19.333
Nobody could have stopped him.

02:04:41.416 --> 02:04:44.333
