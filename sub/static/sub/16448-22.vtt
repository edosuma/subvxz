WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:04.004
Hey, finish your breakfast.
You're gonna be
late for school.

00:04.072 --> 00:06.707
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.410
Well, when you're livin' in
a cardboard box
looking for cans

00:09.477 --> 00:10.811
so you can have some hot soup,

00:10.878 --> 00:12.246
you'll wish
you'd listened to me.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.083
Whoa, five minutes late
for school,

00:15.149 --> 00:16.450
and you got him
living in a box?

00:16.517 --> 00:19.187
With the possibility
of hot soup.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.390
Morning, Gables.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.425
Uh, hey. I made some oatmeal
in the Crock-Pot.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.395
Yeah, I'm gonna give that
a Crock-Pass.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.063
Let me guess.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.699
You still full from the
ice cream you had last night?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.101
That's right.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.136
I heard you get out of bed
and come down to the kitchen.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.671
Okay, well, then you also
heard the faucet

00:37.738 --> 00:40.141
because all I got was
a glass of water, so...

00:40.208 --> 00:42.042
So you're sayin' that
if I went to the freezer
right now,

00:42.110 --> 00:43.277
there'd still be that

00:43.344 --> 00:44.612
mint chocolate chip
ice cream in there?

00:44.678 --> 00:45.879
That's what I'm sayin'.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.081
Check if you want.
I won't be offended.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.317
I really wouldn't care
if you were.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.155
Aw. Stings, don't it?
All right.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.657
No. I'm happy to be wrong.

00:56.724 --> 00:57.791
Mm.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.193
Mom, sometimes he tricks you

00:59.260 --> 01:01.028
by putting the empty carton
back in.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.530
Hey.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.565
Yeah, I've been burned
by that before.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.367
Come on.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.702
Ah.
( Scoffs )

01:10.138 --> 01:11.972
Oh. Still full, huh?

01:12.039 --> 01:13.607
This is -- I gotta be honest.
It's getting embarrassing.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.976
( Rattles )

01:16.043 --> 01:18.746
( Rattling )
That's weird, huh?

01:21.882 --> 01:23.917
Oh, my gosh. That's...
You know what?

01:23.984 --> 01:26.187
That's -- this is --
We gotta write them a letter.

01:26.254 --> 01:29.357
See? This is exactly
why you are not gonna end up

01:29.423 --> 01:30.991
at Mets Fantasy Camp.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.927
-You said I could go!
-No. We had a deal, remember?

01:33.994 --> 01:35.863
Yes, I remember. It was,
like, six months ago.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.165
It was right here
in this kitchen.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.800
I was eatin' Oreos, and you
came in with the news.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.635
Hey.

01:41.702 --> 01:45.439
How would you like to go
to Mets Fantasy Camp
this year?

01:45.506 --> 01:47.375
Are you kidding me?
Nope.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.343
I might even throw in
a personalized
pitching session

01:49.410 --> 01:51.579
with one Ron Darling.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.147
Why are you doing this?!

01:53.214 --> 01:57.084
Because you are an amazing
husband, an incredible father.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.652
That's what you deserve.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.421
( Exhales )

02:01.955 --> 02:03.857
The only part of that
conversation

02:03.924 --> 02:06.294
that you got right
was the Oreos.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.197
Hey.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.466
How would you like to go to
Mets Fantasy Camp this year?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.868
Are you kidding me?
Nope, but there's a catch.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.238
As you know, or you probably
don't, but you should,

02:17.305 --> 02:18.572
we need to renew

02:18.639 --> 02:20.608
our life insurance policy
in six months,

02:20.674 --> 02:23.043
which means we have to take
a blood test.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.479
-Got it.
-I don't think you do.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.114
Um...

02:27.181 --> 02:29.783
if your cholesterol numbers
come in high,

02:29.850 --> 02:32.386
our premium goes up,
and that's not good.

02:32.453 --> 02:35.823
But if they come in low,
our premium goes down,

02:35.889 --> 02:39.026
we save money, and you know
what happens then?

02:39.092 --> 02:41.695
Pass the savings on to me!
Exactly!

02:41.762 --> 02:43.364
And I'm going to fantasy camp!

02:43.431 --> 02:46.300
Only if you can get
your cholesterol down.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.535
Done deal.
Okay?

02:47.601 --> 02:50.504
( Crunches )
Yep, I'm good.

02:50.571 --> 02:54.508
You know, that means
you have to
stop eating cookies, right?

02:54.575 --> 02:55.876
I just heard the information.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.011
You gotta give a man
a second to celebrate.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.613
Donna, I got this.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.482
All right, whenever I'm faced
with something like this,

03:01.549 --> 03:04.252
I always employ
my 3-pronged system.
Oh.

03:04.318 --> 03:07.187
Prong number one --
laser focus.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.022
Prong number two --
commitment.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.925
Prong number three --
action.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.930
So what happened to
your 3-pronged system?

03:16.997 --> 03:19.267
Look, I'm just gonna be
honest with you.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.369
I, uh...
( Clears throat )

03:21.435 --> 03:22.903
I forgot the first prong.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.307
Right. Sure.

03:26.374 --> 03:31.312
* I am not your ordinary guy

03:31.379 --> 03:35.215
All right, I figured it out.
I-I got a whole new approach.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.784
No, babe, I really --
I honestly
I don't wanna hear it.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.686
Because it's -- it's really
my fault, you know?

03:38.752 --> 03:41.021
I thought that fantasy camp
would motivate you

03:41.088 --> 03:43.957
to get your cholesterol down,
but, you know, I was wrong.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.294
No, no, no. It did.
I'm telling you it did.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.696
I just forgot that it did.
But now I am locked in.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.531
And I got
three brand-new prongs.

03:50.598 --> 03:54.234
Oh, my God.
The test is a week away.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.836
-Prong number one --
-Oh, my God.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.204
I do go to fantasy camp.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.107
Not happening.
Let me finish.

04:00.173 --> 04:02.576
Prong number two -- I work out
while I'm down there.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.445
I'm eating egg whites.
I'm doing green shakes.

04:04.512 --> 04:07.014
I'm running wind sprints
with Darryl Strawberry, right?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.450
Then prong number three --
I came back two months later.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.619
We take the test then.
( Imitates whip cracking )

04:11.685 --> 04:14.288
( Scoffs ) Stop.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.890
Your plan is that we go two
months without life insurance?

04:16.957 --> 04:18.258
Do you think I'm gonna
roll those dice?

04:18.326 --> 04:20.728
You don't think I can
stay alive for 60 days?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.064
( Stutters ) It's just --

04:24.131 --> 04:27.335
I don't understand why this is
so hard, you know?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.970
I think that you should want
to take care of yourself.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.139
That you'd want to see
your kids grow up, you know?

04:32.205 --> 04:34.308
Maybe one day hold
your grandchildren.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.878
Mm, I need something
more tangible.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.613
That's funny.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.415
You know what?
After your heart explodes,

04:41.482 --> 04:43.617
I am going to make sure
to tell husband number two

04:43.684 --> 04:46.019
how hilarious
my first husband was.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.288
You're a cut-up.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.857
Really? Second husband?

04:49.923 --> 04:53.260
Yeah. Well, baby,
I'm gonna move on.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.730
-How soon?
-I don't know.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.966
How long you been dead?

04:59.032 --> 05:00.468
Let's say three months.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.870
Okay, three months. Um, well,
you know, I'm not lookin'.

05:02.936 --> 05:06.974
But I'm not not lookin'.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.177
I hope you're still
wearing black.

05:10.243 --> 05:14.682
Well, no, of course. But...
I look great in black, so...

05:14.748 --> 05:17.250
you know, there's gonna be
a lot of guys
that are gonna wanna get

05:17.317 --> 05:19.587
with the sad girl
in the pencil skirt.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.022
Hmm. That's until he finds out
you got three kids

05:22.089 --> 05:23.957
and a weird British guy
living in your garage.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.327
I'm tellin' ya,
he's gonna run.

05:27.395 --> 05:30.297
Yeah, but he's not gonna run
from my life insurance money.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.433
Oh, honey, why do you think
I got such a big policy?

05:32.500 --> 05:33.967
'Cause me and hubby
number two,

05:34.034 --> 05:35.936
we're gonna be
living in style,
slap it high.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.471
Yeah.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.672
Okay.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.808
No, come on.
Give Mama some love, huh?

05:40.874 --> 05:43.176
Enough.
Give it to number two.

05:45.813 --> 05:49.617
Mr. Gable,
there is a way to do it.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.884
( Bottle cap fizzes )
What?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.986
Your Mets camp.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.788
I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation

05:54.855 --> 05:57.090
with Mrs. Gable.

05:57.157 --> 06:00.761
I can help you lower your
cholesterol before the test.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.129
It's in a week.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.131
If you do everything
that I tell you to do,

06:04.197 --> 06:06.634
you will lower your numbers
significantly.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.035
What do you know
about any of this?

06:08.101 --> 06:10.404
You're built like
a pretzel rod.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.006
Mr. Gable, I'm about to
show you something

06:13.073 --> 06:15.509
that I haven't shown
to anyone in this country.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.778
A paycheck?

06:18.846 --> 06:20.848
It never gets old.

06:23.784 --> 06:27.254
Okay, get ready to know
Chale Eugene Witt

06:27.320 --> 06:28.722
just a little bit better.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.058
This is my deepest secret,
and I trust

06:31.124 --> 06:35.028
that you will treat it
with sensitivity.

06:35.095 --> 06:38.699
So you have a fat sister.
What's the big deal?

06:38.766 --> 06:41.068
Look closer.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.036
Whoa!

06:43.103 --> 06:46.039
That's you? Chale!

06:46.106 --> 06:47.608
Why, you were a big boy.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.943
( Exhales deeply )

06:50.010 --> 06:51.679
What's with the hair?

06:51.745 --> 06:55.248
My mother told me
that long hair
has a slimming effect.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.651
Mama's a liar.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.789
The only reason
that I show you this

07:01.855 --> 07:03.991
is because
at a certain point in my life,

07:04.057 --> 07:05.793
I got very serious about
losing weight

07:05.859 --> 07:07.027
and getting healthy.
Wait a second.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.929
Kids ever call you
"Chale the Whale"?

07:08.996 --> 07:10.631
Yes. They did. Thank you.
Yeah.

07:10.698 --> 07:11.965
Now cholesterol is just one --
Ha ha.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.467
How 'bout
"Chale broke the scale"?

07:13.534 --> 07:14.768
They ever come up
with that one?

07:14.835 --> 07:17.370
Yes, yes. Thank you. Again,
now what we can do --

07:17.437 --> 07:21.074
Last one. "Free Willy,
the U.K. edition."

07:21.141 --> 07:23.276
Mr. Gable, do you want to pass
your cholesterol test or not?

07:23.343 --> 07:25.345
Listen, is this thing
Photoshopped?

07:25.412 --> 07:28.649
Do these look Photoshopped?!

07:30.383 --> 07:33.320
I keep these old pants
to remind me of darker days.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.989
Wow, that is a lot
of dungaree.

07:37.691 --> 07:40.460
Um, needless to say,

07:40.528 --> 07:42.162
Kendra knows
nothing of this,

07:42.229 --> 07:43.864
and I would prefer
to keep it that way.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.099
Fine. So what's the plan?
I got seven days.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.769
A high intensity
master juice cleanse.

07:48.836 --> 07:49.937
Great.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.439
Then if you do this,
your numbers will be so low,

07:52.506 --> 07:54.708
I guarantee you will
pass the test.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.243
As long as it gets me
to Fantasy Camp, I'm good.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.979
Just so you understand,
this is a week
of no solid food.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.748
Just a juice mixture which
I will prepare for you

08:00.814 --> 08:01.882
every single day.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.784
Love juice. I'm a juice guy.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.520
You will sweat
uncontrollably.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.121
Been there.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.896
All right. You sure you don't
want one slice of pizza?

08:15.963 --> 08:18.131
They're using this
new spicy Italian sausage.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.633
It's pretty special.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.402
No, what are you tellin' him
that for? Man's on a diet.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.138
Cleanse, guy. A cleanse.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.940
It's already day two.
I'm over the hump.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.576
So let's just enjoy
the game.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.078
You sure are sweating a lot.
Is that normal?

08:31.144 --> 08:35.282
See, now you see sweat. I see
cholesterol leavin' the body.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.551
I mean, the heart flutters
every once in a while,

08:37.618 --> 08:40.353
but Chale said that's --
Ooh, there it is.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.392
What's up, babe?
You want a slice of pizza?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.194
Enzo's making
his own sausage now.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.930
It is redonk!

08:49.997 --> 08:52.966
Wow. You really don't care,
do you?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.968
What you talkin' about?
( Scoffs )

08:55.035 --> 08:56.770
Five days
until the blood test.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.339
Five days, and you are
gonna be uninsurable.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.374
That would save us
a lot of money, right?

09:01.441 --> 09:02.676
The whole premium.
( Chuckles )

09:02.743 --> 09:04.177
I'd be able to take these guys
to Fantasy Camp.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.746
Oh, yeah!
I'm in!

09:05.813 --> 09:07.414
Shut your face,
shut your face.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.350
I just want you to know

09:10.417 --> 09:12.185
that when your test results
come back,

09:12.252 --> 09:13.687
this is all gonna change.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.590
Okay, no pizza, no junk food,
and, no,

09:16.657 --> 09:18.926
a meatball hero is not Atkins.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.563
What's goin' on?
( Whispers indistinctly )

09:23.631 --> 09:25.599
( Lowered voice )
The table is set.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.534
This is going perfectly.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.670
Yeah, seems like it.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.172
But Donna can't know
I'm cleansing, all right?
Why not?

09:32.239 --> 09:35.008
Because if she thinks
I'm eating the way
I do now, normally,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.978
and my numbers come in low,
she can't say anything.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.348
I'll be able to eat
whatever I want
for the rest of my life!

09:41.414 --> 09:43.717
That is genius.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.686
Yeah, I keep telling you guys,
write this stuff down

09:45.753 --> 09:48.355
'cause I'm throwing out gems
left and right!

09:48.421 --> 09:49.857
( Laughs )

10:01.501 --> 10:03.403
Mr. Gable.
What are you doing?

10:03.470 --> 10:04.972
-Nothing.
-Put down the cookies.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.807
No, no, no, uh,
I was just counting 'em.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.076
Uh, there's, uh, this thing
on the news

10:09.142 --> 10:11.144
about cookie companies
cheating customers.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.512
No, these are...
( Mutters )

10:12.579 --> 10:14.481
Yeah, they're all here.
They're good. Okay.

10:14.547 --> 10:19.586
You are 11 hours away from
the test. Just stay strong.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.922
Mr. Gable, please!

10:21.989 --> 10:24.291
I just want one.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.625
This is day seven, okay?

10:25.693 --> 10:29.329
Most people fall off and start
losing their minds.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.597
( Drawer closes )

10:30.664 --> 10:32.766
Mis--
No, honestly! Honestly!

10:32.833 --> 10:34.334
-These are my friends!
-They are not your friends!

10:34.401 --> 10:35.836
I need these!
They're my friends!
Mr. Gable!

10:35.903 --> 10:37.705
You're right
at the finish line!

10:37.771 --> 10:39.606
You've just gotta run through
the ribbon here.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.408
-You're gonna do it.
-All right, fine.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.743
( Sighs )

10:42.810 --> 10:44.311
This is ridiculous.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.079
Hiding food
in your own house.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.982
Never!
Never, Mr. Gable. Never!

10:49.049 --> 10:51.685
Please don't fail me now!

10:51.752 --> 10:53.687
( Thud )
Okay.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.255
Is there any more food
hidden?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.325
( Sighs )

10:58.391 --> 11:01.929
Doritos in the dryer
and there's Oreos
under the sink.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.099
I'm sorry.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.268
-Anything else?
-No.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.336
( Sighs ) Okay.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.772
Yes.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.442
Smoothie machine.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.150
( Weakly ) I'm so hungry.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.624
Why are you looking at me
like that?

11:33.326 --> 11:36.363
Mr. Gable...
...you're scaring us.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.067
He's gonna bite us.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.268
We should run.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.971
We don't have any legs!

11:46.907 --> 11:48.641
Mr. Gable,
you have the results?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.543
No, not yet.
Any minute, though.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.246
Hey, listen,
I wanna thank you.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.249
This whole week was brutal,
but I-I got through it.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.417
I did it.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.252
Well, you know,
when I did my diet,

11:59.319 --> 12:01.588
I kind of used it
as a springboard

12:01.654 --> 12:03.056
to a healthier lifestyle

12:03.123 --> 12:05.826
and a different relationship
with food.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.396
Yeah, me and food
are pretty good.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.532
In fact, you're kind of like
a third wheel.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.567
I'm gonna be honest, you know.
( Laughs )

12:14.634 --> 12:16.870
-Enjoy that burger.
-Yep.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.840
Honey, got an email
with the test results.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.575
So you wanna look together
while you enjoy

12:22.642 --> 12:25.245
your last cheeseburger?

12:25.312 --> 12:30.183
Sorry, second of four
cheeseburgers?

12:30.250 --> 12:33.320
It's a whole
wheat bun, though.
I mean, so it's heart smart.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.222
Well,
let's do it then, huh?

12:35.288 --> 12:38.525
I mean, I hope this is
a wake-up call.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.759
-All right.
-Okay.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.294
Oh, just what I thought.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.931
Premium's gone up big time,
and here's why --

12:43.997 --> 12:45.999
"Lipid levels --
above normal.

12:46.066 --> 12:50.737
HDL cholesterol --
elevated and concerning."

12:50.804 --> 12:52.672
Wait a second.
Where do you see that?

12:52.739 --> 12:55.175
-Right there, huh?
-Oh, wow.

12:55.242 --> 12:58.946
Oh, babe, honestly, I hate
to say I told you so,

12:59.012 --> 13:00.680
but I have to --
No, I mean "wow,"

13:00.747 --> 13:02.249
because all these years
I had no clue

13:02.315 --> 13:06.854
that Kevin was
actually spelled D-O-N-N-A!

13:06.920 --> 13:08.288
What are you talking about?

13:08.355 --> 13:10.390
You just read your own
results, Donna Gable.
What?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.525
You're the unhealthy one!
What? No.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.394
That can't be right.
What about your results, huh?

13:14.461 --> 13:15.762
They're right here.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.497
What have I got? I got, uh,
ooh, I'm at normal range.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.132
What?
I'm in the normal range,
normal range, ooh,

13:19.199 --> 13:21.134
it looks like somebody
should be on the cover
of "Men's Health."

13:21.201 --> 13:23.170
Yeah!

13:23.236 --> 13:25.772
What? No. Let me --
Yes!

13:25.839 --> 13:27.674
No, let me look at this,
okay?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.576
How is this possible?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.912
I-I guess I won
the gene lottery.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.114
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner -- No.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.950
Winner, winner,
fried chicken dinner!

13:44.657 --> 13:46.593
Hi, babe.
Where you headed?

13:46.659 --> 13:49.029
On a very long run.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.531
I'm gonna make it hurt.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.133
Good for you.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.768
I mean, exercise, it's just
so important, you know?

13:55.835 --> 13:58.005
You gotta get after it.
It's really good.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.209
( Mouth full ) 'Cause if you
don't have your health,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.477
you got nothin'.
You really don't.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.812
Uh-huh.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.647
You know, hon --

14:07.714 --> 14:10.517
Remember before
when you thought I was
gonna be the unhealthy one

14:10.583 --> 14:13.086
and you were kind of
teasing me about moving on?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.654
Yeah.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.356
Yeah, well, in light
of the recent events,

14:16.423 --> 14:17.958
I just wanted to see if you
thought this one

14:18.025 --> 14:20.260
as a potential wife
number two.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.495
Are you on a dating site?

14:22.562 --> 14:25.365
What? No, no.
It's women's powerlifting.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.699
I'm going a different way.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.867
It's not that you haven't
been great,

14:27.935 --> 14:29.036
'cause you've been fantastic.
Thank you.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.303
It's just that --
you know what it is?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.139
Winter comes along
and I'm just so sick

14:32.205 --> 14:33.306
of shoveling the driveway.
Mm-hmm.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.607
I wanna get someone --

14:34.674 --> 14:36.309
This is Corinne.
She benches like 350.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.979
She'll blow it out,
no problem.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.480
Well,
I give you my blessing.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.982
'Cause that's a man.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.687
Then he's definitely
shoveling.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.360
-Hi, babe.
-Hey.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.095
-Ready for movie night.
-Oh, wow.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.364
Oh! Fantastic. Brownies.
( Chuckles )

14:57.430 --> 15:00.000
I've got us some lovely wine.
Let me pour.

15:00.067 --> 15:04.771
2017, apparently a fantastic
year for 2-buck chuck.

15:06.073 --> 15:11.078
( Wine pouring )

15:19.186 --> 15:21.521
Uh...Chale?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.857
Oh, sweet Lord.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.995
Okay, what's her name?

15:31.264 --> 15:34.001
Oh, gosh. Uh, okay.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.602
I have something
to show you.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.305
Um, brace yourself.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.979
( Groans )

15:46.046 --> 15:48.748
Whoa, your sister
is massive!

15:48.815 --> 15:52.019
No, it's not my sister.
That's me.

15:52.085 --> 15:55.455
Why does everyone keep...

15:55.522 --> 15:57.524
That's you? What?

15:57.590 --> 15:58.958
Why would you never
tell me this?

15:59.026 --> 16:02.795
I just -- I was waiting for it
to come up organically. I --

16:02.862 --> 16:05.965
Okay, dude. How was this gonna
come up organically?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.202
Now you know my dilemma.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.938
Yeah, but okay, babe, you were
a little overweight

16:12.005 --> 16:13.406
and had a terrible haircut,

16:13.473 --> 16:15.275
but why would you keep that
a secret from me?

16:15.342 --> 16:18.611
-I mean, why would I care?
-Why? Because!

16:18.678 --> 16:21.014
When people know that you
have been big,

16:21.081 --> 16:22.515
it affects the way
they see you.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.517
And it changes the way
they see you eat.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.486
Oh, come on, Chale.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.488
Okay, watch.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.695
( Mouth full ) Oh, yes.
There it is. There it is.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.430
No. You're crazy.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.035
Ah, a nice
healthy-looking lunch.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.670
Shut up, Chale.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.405
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.275
It's just I do Pilates,
I watch what I eat,

16:48.341 --> 16:51.311
while meanwhile the Hamburglar
who sleeps next to me,

16:51.378 --> 16:53.080
he gets to eat
whatever he wants?

16:53.146 --> 16:54.681
How is that possible?

16:54.747 --> 16:56.383
It's not fair.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.119
Sometimes things aren't
always as they appear.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.753
Perhaps there is
a little secret

17:00.820 --> 17:02.589
to your husband's
stellar numbers.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.790
What are you talking about?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.493
It's a long story about
a little boy

17:06.559 --> 17:09.829
with a girl's haircut
and a very large
pair of pants.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.001
Hey, hon.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.437
Tell me you got my text
about chalupas.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.339
You drive
right past Taco Bell.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.940
I don't know what you're
talking about. I got no text.

17:21.007 --> 17:25.678
Ugh! You gotta check
your phone, guy.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.948
What's goin' on?

17:29.015 --> 17:30.917
Nothin', you know, I just...

17:30.983 --> 17:32.785
( Mouth full ) I had
a moment of clarity.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.787
If my cholesterol's high,
it's gonna be high, you know?

17:34.854 --> 17:37.524
I mean, why not look at it
like a-a carnival bell,

17:37.590 --> 17:39.058
just see how high
I can ring it.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.260
Come on,
you're acting crazy.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.794
No, no, no, no, no,
you were right.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.897
Because you need to be
prepared for a life
without me.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.500
So I actually wanna show you
all this stuff.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.170
So we got -- this is --
there's mortgage payments,

17:50.237 --> 17:53.540
we got property taxes
and Kendra's student loans...
What are you doing? Stop it!

17:53.606 --> 17:55.675
...we got our insurance.
I can't do any of this
stuff without you!

17:55.742 --> 17:59.346
Exactly. Which is why
I want you to have
lunch with Kimberly.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.414
What --

18:01.481 --> 18:02.915
The girl from your school?

18:02.982 --> 18:04.751
Yeah. You know, you're gonna
need a woman in your life.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.219
So will the kids, you know.
Right.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.821
She's -- she's organized,
she's kind.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.490
You said she was pretty.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.459
Yeah, she is.
She is pretty. Yeah.
Yeah, hmm?

18:12.525 --> 18:15.495
All right, well, um, look,
if we're gonna do this...

18:15.562 --> 18:16.896
Okay.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.399
I was thinking more maybe
like, uh, I don't know,

18:19.466 --> 18:21.901
Lisa,
your Pilates instructor.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.304
What?

18:24.371 --> 18:25.638
Yeah, it's just I like
the way she barks out

18:25.705 --> 18:27.974
all the instructions
and stuff, very bossy.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.009
It kind of does it for me.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.411
God, I can't believe you!

18:31.478 --> 18:33.346
Chale told me about
the stupid cleanse.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.683
He told --
That fat little girl!

18:36.749 --> 18:40.953
You cheated on a blood test.
Who does that?

18:41.020 --> 18:43.923
I don't know. How 'bout every
Russian Olympic athlete ever?

18:45.392 --> 18:46.826
Look, I did
what I had to do!

18:46.893 --> 18:48.161
I hit my numbers.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.096
I should be on my way
to Mets Fantasy Camp.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.932
But you, you didn't hit yours.
That's right.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.001
And now we gotta pay
a higher premium.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.603
I should be the one
who's mad.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.571
Look, I wanted you to go
to Mets Fantasy Camp.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.674
All right? Obviously, I don't
want you with another woman.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.276
And I don't want you
with another guy.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.078
Look, just let's agree
to buy the farm
on the same exact day.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.614
How's that?

19:07.680 --> 19:10.350
Okay, uh, but you're
a little older than me,

19:10.417 --> 19:11.984
so it kind of gyps me

19:12.051 --> 19:13.653
out of a couple good years
of life, right?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.388
( Sighs )
I don't know.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.257
How 'bout this?
Hmm?

19:17.324 --> 19:18.891
If I go first, I promise you,

19:18.958 --> 19:20.560
I will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.462
Every once in a while,
the fridge will pop open,

19:22.529 --> 19:24.130
a beer will float out.

19:24.197 --> 19:29.369
Or the George Foreman Grill
will just heat up
for no reason.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.671
You know, I am sorry

19:31.738 --> 19:34.674
that you're not going
to Mets Fantasy Camp.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.209
You know what?

19:36.276 --> 19:38.411
Your numbers weren't
that bad.
( Clicks tongue )

19:38.478 --> 19:40.447
I'm telling you,
if you did Chale's cleanse,

19:40.513 --> 19:41.781
we can get you
in the right zone.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.816
Um, he said
it was brutal.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.752
( Sighs ) It was brutal for me
because I did it alone.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.254
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I promise you,

19:47.320 --> 19:48.988
I will do it with you.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.824
-You'd do that for me?
-Absolutely.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.960
But not tonight.
What?

19:54.026 --> 19:58.130
Starting tomorrow. Tonight
we are crushing Taco Bell.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.066
You said chalupas,
it got in my head.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.568
I gotta go get 'em.
Go get 'em.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.870
Ooh, Nachos Bell Grande.
No tomato. I'm serious.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.805
Yeah. Ooh, that's good, too.
Now that's in my head, too.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.774
I'm getting those also.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.414
Here you go.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.682
( Sighs )

20:15.748 --> 20:17.717
Day six.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.320
Stay strong.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.257
( Sighs )

20:25.325 --> 20:26.926
How you holdin' up?

20:26.993 --> 20:30.263
I'm all right. You know,
now that the crying
has stopped.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.633
It -- it has stopped, right?
I'm not crying now, am I?

20:33.700 --> 20:35.435
No.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.804
No, that stopped yesterday.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.507
( Sniffles ) Oh.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.810
I think the hallucinations
you're talkin' about started.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.148
I'm not hatin' them.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.019
Me neither.

20:57.123 --> 21:00.427
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

21:00.493 --> 21:04.030
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

21:04.096 --> 21:06.232
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:06.299 --> 21:07.767
* Do, do, do, do

21:07.834 --> 21:11.371
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:11.438 --> 21:14.441
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:14.507 --> 21:17.076
* I just don't want no...
