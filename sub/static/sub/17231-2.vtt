WEBVTT

00:01.872 --> 00:05.076
These workman comp cases are so boring.

00:06.579 --> 00:09.013
How long have we been
out here, three hours?

00:09.015 --> 00:10.882
10 minutes.

00:11.884 --> 00:13.351
This is the worst.

00:13.353 --> 00:15.220
If I'm gonna be on my knees this long,

00:15.222 --> 00:17.422
I better be getting jewelry.

00:21.027 --> 00:24.162
We just have to get a picture
of Mr. Neck Brace over there

00:24.164 --> 00:26.164
doing something strenuous.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.398
That could take forever!

00:27.400 --> 00:29.167
I never do anything strenuous.

00:29.169 --> 00:31.069
Sure you do, your Kegels.

00:31.071 --> 00:33.471
Those are strenuous.

00:38.511 --> 00:39.944
Off!

00:39.946 --> 00:42.647
Good God, did you have a bagel with onions?

00:44.383 --> 00:46.017
We're the Mystery Girls!

00:46.019 --> 00:47.552
I'm pretty sure the cast of "Frasier"

00:47.554 --> 00:49.187
doesn't hide in bushes.

00:49.189 --> 00:52.056
Uh, well, did they open a detective agency?

00:52.058 --> 00:55.159
I'm just saying, we should
be solving sexy crimes

00:55.161 --> 00:58.596
like jewel heists, disinherited heiresses.

00:58.598 --> 01:00.999
Whatever, this is a paying case.

01:01.001 --> 01:03.968
Ooh, look, Mr. Neck Brace
is taking off his shirt.

01:03.970 --> 01:05.970
Is that sexy enough for you?

01:05.972 --> 01:09.574
Gross, his boobs are bigger than mine!

01:10.976 --> 01:12.310
Oh, here comes the money shot.

01:12.312 --> 01:14.479
He's headed towards the trampoline.

01:14.481 --> 01:17.915
"Trampoline," that's my name on Tinder.

01:17.917 --> 01:20.084
- Nick, what are you doing here?
- Nick, thank God.

01:20.086 --> 01:22.120
I'm starting to burn.

01:22.122 --> 01:24.989
- Get down!
- I'm wearing white linen pants.

01:24.991 --> 01:28.092
The only place I'm getting
down is on a beach in Ibiza.

01:28.094 --> 01:29.294
Umbrella me!

01:29.296 --> 01:31.095
Oh, perfect, he saw us.

01:31.097 --> 01:34.132
- You just blew our stakeout.
- I did not.

01:34.134 --> 01:36.000
Look, you can get a close-up,
he's coming right at us.

01:36.002 --> 01:38.536
With a shovel!

01:38.538 --> 01:40.071
Run!

02:00.059 --> 02:01.659
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

02:01.661 --> 02:03.728
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

02:03.730 --> 02:06.164
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

02:06.166 --> 02:09.366
Are you guys FaceTiming a gorilla?

02:09.369 --> 02:11.102
We're trying to find Nick a date.

02:11.104 --> 02:12.370
You have to come see this app.

02:12.372 --> 02:13.705
So many hot guys.

02:13.707 --> 02:16.541
I thought you were looking
for a sexy case for us,

02:16.543 --> 02:18.343
something worthy of the Mystery Girls.

02:18.345 --> 02:20.078
That's already taken care of.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.448
One should be walking
through our door any second.

02:23.450 --> 02:24.515
All right, where is it?

02:26.086 --> 02:27.018
Where's what?

02:27.020 --> 02:28.720
Well, Detective Duane Freeman,

02:28.722 --> 02:30.520
What are you doing here?

02:30.522 --> 02:34.058
you texted me saying you found
a dead body in the kitchen.

02:34.060 --> 02:35.059
What?

02:35.061 --> 02:37.028
I knew that would work.

02:37.030 --> 02:38.062
That's how I got "T.M.Z."

02:38.064 --> 02:39.530
to cover my birthday party.

02:40.733 --> 02:42.767
Got any sexy cases for us?

02:42.769 --> 02:44.736
- This is your plan?
- Yes.

02:44.738 --> 02:46.104
Excuse me.

02:48.374 --> 02:49.674
Freeman here.

02:49.676 --> 02:50.708
Really?

02:50.710 --> 02:51.709
Another celebrity?

02:51.711 --> 02:53.544
Ryan Gosling's house?

02:53.546 --> 02:55.113
I'm on my way.

02:55.115 --> 02:56.748
Ryan Gosling?

02:56.750 --> 02:59.083
I love him.

02:59.085 --> 03:01.052
No, you don't. You like Ryan Reynolds.

03:01.754 --> 03:03.755
You're not the boss of my Ryan.

03:03.757 --> 03:05.623
I like Ryan Phillippe.

03:05.625 --> 03:06.724
He's so damaged.

03:06.726 --> 03:09.260
I feel like I could save him.

03:09.262 --> 03:12.029
Clearly, you guys have a lot of work to do.

03:12.031 --> 03:13.231
And I have a robbery to solve.

03:13.233 --> 03:14.465
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:14.467 --> 03:15.733
Is there a new Bling Ring?

03:15.735 --> 03:17.301
- No.
- Ha!

03:17.303 --> 03:18.770
You answered too fast, that means yes.

03:18.772 --> 03:20.138
Don't jump to conclusions.

03:20.140 --> 03:21.506
Mm, too late.

03:21.508 --> 03:23.708
That's her favorite thing to do.

03:23.710 --> 03:26.077
That and watching videos of baby sloths.

03:26.079 --> 03:28.413
Oh, she's right.

03:28.415 --> 03:29.514
I just want to smush them

03:29.516 --> 03:32.417
in a little ball and eat them!

03:32.419 --> 03:33.718
Okay. I need to get back

03:33.720 --> 03:35.420
to doing what I do best.

03:35.422 --> 03:37.522
Squat thrusts?

03:39.057 --> 03:40.191
Solving crimes.

03:43.228 --> 03:45.163
Just making sure about that dead body.

03:47.433 --> 03:49.700
Now, this is a case for Mystery Girls.

03:49.702 --> 03:50.701
No, it is not.

03:50.703 --> 03:52.236
What? Why?

03:52.238 --> 03:53.771
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't focus

03:53.773 --> 03:55.373
all our energy on this.

03:55.375 --> 03:57.408
Okay, one, because the
police are already on it,

03:57.410 --> 03:58.910
two, because we're not getting paid,

03:58.912 --> 04:00.745
three, we already have
a workman's comp case.

04:00.747 --> 04:03.080
I said one, woman.

04:03.082 --> 04:04.549
I know,

04:04.551 --> 04:06.551
we should go investigate at Club Zebra.

04:06.553 --> 04:09.687
Yes, let's go to Club "Zeb-ra."

04:09.689 --> 04:11.556
Wait, what the hell is Club Zebra?

04:11.558 --> 04:13.758
"Zeb-ra."

04:13.760 --> 04:16.127
It's only the hottest nightclub in L.A.

04:16.129 --> 04:18.463
It's where all the young
and fabulous mingle.

04:18.464 --> 04:20.464
That's how they caught
the original Bling Ring.

04:20.466 --> 04:23.601
No, Holly, I have date night with Michael.

04:23.603 --> 04:26.204
And I've cancelled on
him three weeks in a row

04:26.206 --> 04:27.338
because of work.

04:27.340 --> 04:30.174
Well, it sounds like he's used to it.

04:30.176 --> 04:32.410
Nick, go to my credenza.

04:32.412 --> 04:37.348
Get energy drinks, body
glitter, and magnums.

04:37.350 --> 04:39.417
On it!

04:39.419 --> 04:43.287
What? Go big or go home.

04:43.289 --> 04:45.490
It's not 1995 anymore, Holly.

04:45.492 --> 04:48.259
Ugh, you sound like my agent.

04:48.261 --> 04:49.727
What I mean is I have a family.

04:49.729 --> 04:51.629
I can't just go out clubbing with you guys.

04:51.631 --> 04:53.631
It's research.

04:53.633 --> 04:56.901
Research, really? Since
when do you do research?

04:56.903 --> 05:00.304
You're the person that bought
their house over the phone.

05:00.306 --> 05:03.140
Please? We haven't gone
to a club in forever.

05:03.142 --> 05:06.577
Think of it... free drinks,
hot guys, V.I.P. rooms.

05:06.579 --> 05:08.212
It'll be just like the good old days.

05:08.214 --> 05:09.747
You mean you'll end up doing body shots

05:09.749 --> 05:12.817
off Mario Lopez's chest?

05:12.819 --> 05:16.187
I did some dirty things to those dimples.

05:26.331 --> 05:29.267
Okay, here we go, three
ice-waters with lemon.

05:29.269 --> 05:30.935
What happened to three dirty Martinis?

05:30.937 --> 05:32.737
What happened is they're $20 each.

05:32.739 --> 05:35.373
It's like drinking in a mortgage payment.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.208
♪ We don't need drinks ♪

05:37.210 --> 05:38.743
♪ To get this party started ♪

05:38.745 --> 05:40.745

05:42.582 --> 05:43.648
Okay.

05:43.650 --> 05:45.583
Maybe we do, I'll be right back.

05:46.818 --> 05:49.654
What are so many people
doing out at this hour?

05:49.656 --> 05:51.789
Don't they have jobs or school

05:51.791 --> 05:53.925
or programs to watch?

05:53.927 --> 05:55.760
Calm down, Nana.

05:55.762 --> 05:56.894
Enjoy the ambiance.

05:56.896 --> 05:58.963
Everyone seems friendly.

05:58.965 --> 05:59.986
Ugh!

05:59.988 --> 06:02.433
Seriously, that's where you're standing?

06:02.435 --> 06:03.601
Sorry.

06:03.603 --> 06:05.436
Nice jacket.

06:05.438 --> 06:08.839
Looks like you're being humped by a Muppet.

06:08.841 --> 06:10.213
How'd they get in here?

06:10.215 --> 06:11.876
They were probably just
standing on the street,

06:11.878 --> 06:13.711
and they built the club around them.

06:13.713 --> 06:15.713
- Good one, Slade.
- I know.

06:15.715 --> 06:18.783
Okay, let's go before I kill someone.

06:18.785 --> 06:20.985
I'm gonna go take pictures of the suspects.

06:20.987 --> 06:23.821
Wait, suspects, because
they bumped into you?

06:23.823 --> 06:25.356
No, 'cause I got a hunch.

06:25.358 --> 06:27.391
Oh, not another hunch.

06:27.393 --> 06:31.462
Remember, that's my
nickname, Hunch Hamilton!

06:31.464 --> 06:32.863
That's what they always called me on set.

06:32.865 --> 06:35.866
That was because of your posture.

06:35.868 --> 06:37.501
It's better than your nickname,

06:37.503 --> 06:39.370
Miss Poop-Head-No-Fun-Lady.

06:39.372 --> 06:40.371
Who called me that?

06:40.373 --> 06:41.839
I did, just now.

06:41.841 --> 06:43.774
I think it's gonna be a thing.

06:43.776 --> 06:46.010
- Is this the way our night's gonna go?
- Mm-hmm.

06:46.012 --> 06:47.612
Because if we're just
gonna be wasting time,

06:47.614 --> 06:49.547
I would rather go home and
waste time with my husband.

06:49.549 --> 06:51.782
Oh, come on, just have one drink.

06:51.784 --> 06:53.784
- Yeah.
- Okay, fine.

06:53.786 --> 06:54.986
Oh!

06:57.856 --> 06:58.956
Peace out, bitches.

07:09.434 --> 07:11.902
- Can we talk?
- Nope.

07:11.904 --> 07:13.371
Meditating.

07:15.340 --> 07:18.509
Oh, are you sure you're
not being passive aggressive

07:18.511 --> 07:20.444
since I ditched you at the club last night?

07:20.446 --> 07:22.346
♪ I can't hear you. ♪

07:22.348 --> 07:25.516
Aligning my... ♪ Chakras. ♪

07:25.518 --> 07:27.918
Hm, then you won't mind if I do this.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.020
B-b-b-bleh!

07:31.923 --> 07:34.525
You kidding me?

07:34.527 --> 07:36.861
So, Hunch Hamilton, how
was the rest of your night?

07:36.863 --> 07:39.397
Did you have fun harassing the hipsters?

07:39.399 --> 07:40.698
They're the Bling Ring!

07:40.700 --> 07:42.021
Okay, stop it.

07:42.023 --> 07:43.801
This is not an episode
of "The Mystery Girls"

07:43.803 --> 07:45.836
where there is a good
guy, and then three minutes

07:45.838 --> 07:48.072
before the end of the episode,
it turns into the bad guy.

07:48.074 --> 07:51.942
Fine, you want facts, don't move.

07:51.944 --> 07:53.878
Move!

07:53.880 --> 07:54.912
Where are you going?

07:54.914 --> 07:56.113
Going to get facts

07:56.115 --> 07:59.116
so Miss Poop-Head-No-Fun-Lady can relax.

07:59.118 --> 08:01.452
It's missus, I'm married.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.779
You got no alibi.

08:06.781 --> 08:09.326
Your fingerprints are
all over the crime scene.

08:09.328 --> 08:11.629
So tell me, where'd you bury the bodies?

08:14.099 --> 08:16.100
I brought macaroons!

08:19.505 --> 08:21.606
What is happening here?

08:21.608 --> 08:23.441
This woman was at your desk,

08:23.443 --> 08:25.910
going through your files.

08:25.912 --> 08:27.445
Oh, may I?

08:27.447 --> 08:28.880
Are you guilty?

08:28.882 --> 08:29.981
No.

08:29.983 --> 08:31.115
Then yes.

08:31.117 --> 08:32.884
I brought lemon, pistachio, rose water.

08:32.885 --> 08:35.220
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

08:35.222 --> 08:37.322
I wanted to see your
files on the Bling Ring.

08:37.323 --> 08:38.456
It's a free country...

08:38.457 --> 08:40.091
for most people.

08:40.092 --> 08:41.392
No offence.

08:41.394 --> 08:43.461
Wait a minute, you're famous, right?

08:43.462 --> 08:44.462
Did you play Buffy?

08:44.464 --> 08:46.264
Mm, almost.

08:46.266 --> 08:48.299
Sarah Michelle kneecapped me
on the way to the audition.

08:49.302 --> 08:51.436
Stop talking to her, okay?

08:51.438 --> 08:52.503
Did you read what's in here?

08:52.505 --> 08:54.405
Depends, would you be mad if I did?

08:54.407 --> 08:57.208
- Yes.
- Then nope, I didn't.

08:57.210 --> 08:58.376
You know, this is a shame.

08:58.378 --> 09:00.311
I thought we could partner up on this one,

09:00.313 --> 09:03.081
like "Turner & Hooch."

09:03.083 --> 09:05.016
I'm not your Hooch.

09:05.018 --> 09:07.352
Fine, I'll just have
to solve this case solo.

09:07.354 --> 09:09.654
No, you won't, or I'll have you arrested.

09:09.656 --> 09:11.189
And a pretty blonde lady like you

09:11.191 --> 09:12.457
would be awfully popular in prison.

09:12.459 --> 09:14.225
Well, that threat doesn't work,

09:14.227 --> 09:16.361
because I like being popular.

09:20.232 --> 09:21.599
You called me pretty.

09:21.601 --> 09:23.534
Can't take that back.

09:25.271 --> 09:29.107
Detective Freeman, I wish to confess...

09:29.109 --> 09:32.043
that these are the best
macaroons I've ever eaten.

09:32.045 --> 09:33.378
Oh... oh, man,

09:33.380 --> 09:36.547
it's like there's so much happening.

09:40.185 --> 09:41.252
Where have you been?

09:41.254 --> 09:42.353
Nowhere.

09:42.355 --> 09:44.322
Stealing files from the police.

09:44.324 --> 09:46.157
Wait, what?

09:46.159 --> 09:48.626
Not all of them, just
as many as I could grab

09:48.628 --> 09:52.330
before I got fingered by the man.

09:52.332 --> 09:55.433
Okay, that's a poor
choice of words, but go on.

09:55.435 --> 09:59.237
Check this out. Robert Pattinson's
house got robbed two weeks ago.

09:59.239 --> 10:01.072
- So?
- So?

10:01.074 --> 10:03.308
Remember that jacket that
guy was wearing last night?

10:03.310 --> 10:05.343
Well, here's Robert Pattinson

10:05.345 --> 10:06.377
wearing the same jacket.

10:06.379 --> 10:08.346
People can have the same jacket.

10:08.348 --> 10:10.648
Remember that fight you
got into with Lance Bass?

10:13.285 --> 10:15.453
I wore it better.

10:16.588 --> 10:19.691
Anyway, Demi Lovato's
house was also robbed,

10:19.693 --> 10:21.426
so we have to go back to that club

10:21.428 --> 10:23.394
and see if the Bling Ring
is wearing her clothes.

10:23.396 --> 10:26.030
No, no, Holly, you have
got to drop this, okay?

10:26.032 --> 10:27.332
Stealing files from the police,

10:27.334 --> 10:29.133
that could get us into serious trouble.

10:29.135 --> 10:31.069
Yeah, if you narc on me.

10:32.304 --> 10:33.738
We followed your hunch last night,

10:33.740 --> 10:35.139
and it led nowhere.

10:35.141 --> 10:36.507
We're following my hunch tonight.

10:36.509 --> 10:38.576
And I'm going out to dinner with my husband

10:38.578 --> 10:40.345
and you're staying home.

10:40.347 --> 10:44.115
F.Y.I., you're not really
using the word "Hunch" right.

10:49.989 --> 10:51.389
Charlie's gonna kill us.

10:51.391 --> 10:55.460
Kill us with kindness
after we solve this case.

10:56.496 --> 10:58.096
Whoo, there's our guy!

11:07.406 --> 11:09.407
English, English!

11:09.409 --> 11:10.742
I hope this club is up to code

11:10.744 --> 11:13.378
'cause if not, I'm gonna burst into flames.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.962
I'm gonna go talk to them.

11:14.964 --> 11:17.248
You hang back in case things get loco.

11:17.250 --> 11:20.017
Oh... how loco?

11:20.019 --> 11:21.486
It's a club!

11:21.488 --> 11:24.455
Sometimes I throw a drink, it's my thing.

11:26.191 --> 11:28.025
Hey, is this seat taken?

11:28.027 --> 11:30.094
- Yes.
- Good.

11:31.230 --> 11:32.764
Hot earrings.

11:32.766 --> 11:35.032
They look just like the
ones Demi Lovato wore

11:35.034 --> 11:36.300
to the Billboard Awards.

11:36.302 --> 11:38.403
Yeah, but I wore 'em better.

11:40.340 --> 11:44.175
Uh... you know whose clothes I just love?

11:44.177 --> 11:46.511
Jennifer Lawrence's.

11:46.513 --> 11:48.479
Did you say Jennifer Lawrence?

11:48.481 --> 11:50.047
Sure did, yo.

11:50.049 --> 11:51.749
I love J-Law's style.

11:51.751 --> 11:54.185
Totes, me too.

11:54.187 --> 11:56.487
Uh, "Totes" is out...

11:56.489 --> 11:57.422
like your nipple.

11:57.424 --> 11:58.523
Psych!

11:58.525 --> 12:01.692
Charisma, one, whoever you are, zero.

12:01.694 --> 12:03.628
Oh, we met last night.

12:03.630 --> 12:05.563
You insulted my fur!

12:05.565 --> 12:08.499
Oh, right, Charisma, two.

12:08.501 --> 12:12.437
Well, Charisma, back to J-Law,
I live in her neighborhood,

12:12.439 --> 12:14.472
and I heard she's out
of town filming a movie.

12:14.474 --> 12:18.609
Oh, man, would I love to
look through her closets.

12:25.484 --> 12:27.151
I knew it.

12:27.153 --> 12:30.388
Oh my God, it's my mom.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.290
B.R.B.

12:33.225 --> 12:34.425
What are you doing here?

12:34.427 --> 12:36.010
I thought you were on a date.

12:36.012 --> 12:37.495
Yeah, I made a dinner
reservation next-door,

12:37.497 --> 12:39.464
because I had a hunch you'd do this.

12:39.466 --> 12:42.567
Well, well, well, the
Hunchee becomes the Huncher.

12:42.569 --> 12:44.302
Come, come on, let go.

12:44.304 --> 12:46.471
Get your claws off me, Lobster Woman.

12:48.340 --> 12:50.408
Hurry, Michael thinks
I'm still in the bathroom.

12:50.410 --> 12:52.810
Hey, you're here!

12:52.812 --> 12:54.445
Someone came to party.

12:54.447 --> 12:57.548
Just give me two more minutes,
the trap is almost set.

12:57.550 --> 12:58.633
What trap?

12:58.635 --> 13:01.319
I'm trying to convince them
to go rob Jennifer Lawrence.

13:01.321 --> 13:04.355
No, hasn't Katniss suffered enough?

13:04.357 --> 13:06.157
The wheels are already in motion.

13:06.159 --> 13:07.158
I'll be right back.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.293
Don't worry, I'm gonna be cool.

13:09.295 --> 13:10.428
She won't be cool.

13:10.430 --> 13:11.896
Now things are gonna get crazy.

13:11.898 --> 13:13.364
Why can't she just go home and go to bed?

13:13.366 --> 13:15.433
She slammed five energy
drinks in the past hour,

13:15.435 --> 13:16.467
so probably not.

13:16.469 --> 13:17.768
Oh God.

13:17.770 --> 13:19.237
Last time she drank that many,

13:19.239 --> 13:20.571
she fought the Red Knight at Medieval Times

13:20.573 --> 13:21.606
with her turkey leg.

13:21.608 --> 13:23.441
Charlie, you're overreacting.

13:23.443 --> 13:25.443
Oh, she won.

13:25.445 --> 13:26.544
Let go of me!

13:26.546 --> 13:28.446
You let go of me!

13:28.448 --> 13:29.447
I asked you first.

13:29.449 --> 13:30.448
Ugh!

13:33.752 --> 13:35.253
What did you do?

13:35.255 --> 13:36.387
I threw a drink.

13:36.389 --> 13:38.222
It's my thing.

13:47.232 --> 13:48.299
This is great.

13:48.301 --> 13:50.234
You got thrown out, and I got stuck

13:50.236 --> 13:53.037
with a tab for an $800 bottle of vodka.

13:53.039 --> 13:57.108
Yeah, I probably should have
thrown something cheaper.

13:57.110 --> 13:58.220
Guys, you seem awfully calm

13:58.222 --> 14:01.546
considering this entire
building is spinning in a circle.

14:01.548 --> 14:04.048
How'd you afford to get so hungover?

14:04.050 --> 14:06.184
Petty cash. And someone had to stay behind

14:06.186 --> 14:07.296
and get Slade's phone number.

14:07.298 --> 14:11.656
And you can thank me by not
screaming all of your sentences.

14:11.658 --> 14:14.759
Text Slade, see where
he's gonna be tonight.

14:14.761 --> 14:18.463
No, no, you and Pinocchio
have gone far enough.

14:20.099 --> 14:21.332
This case is closed,

14:21.334 --> 14:23.334
and I am returning this file to the police

14:23.336 --> 14:25.169
where it belongs.

14:26.505 --> 14:28.406
Wait, do I look like Pinocchio?

14:30.275 --> 14:31.542
No!

14:31.544 --> 14:32.610
Well, sometimes,

14:32.612 --> 14:35.380
when you wear suspenders and shorts.

14:37.082 --> 14:39.317
Okay, you've had a night in solitary

14:39.319 --> 14:40.218
to think about it.

14:40.220 --> 14:42.253
There are no more macaroons.

14:42.255 --> 14:44.122
Ready to talk?

14:44.124 --> 14:46.724
Caught another blonde lady
stealing stuff from your desk!

14:46.726 --> 14:49.327
I wasn't stealing, I was returning.

14:49.329 --> 14:50.428
And I brought cookies because I heard

14:50.430 --> 14:52.764
someone has a sweet tooth.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.232
Holly stole this?

14:54.234 --> 14:55.333
Hey, I know you from TV.

14:55.335 --> 14:57.135
You were on "Ally McBeal," right?

14:57.137 --> 15:00.671
Yes, and you were on the
News, covered in blood.

15:00.673 --> 15:03.374
Hey, stop talking to each other.

15:03.376 --> 15:04.709
You guys know stealing
from a police station

15:04.711 --> 15:06.244
is extra illegal, right?

15:06.246 --> 15:08.146
Yes, I am aware of that,

15:08.148 --> 15:10.615
but Holly gets obsessed with things.

15:10.617 --> 15:14.252
Last week it was Blue Ivy,
this week it's the Bling Ring.

15:14.254 --> 15:15.319
She thinks she's on to something.

15:15.321 --> 15:16.398
- I doubt that.
- Why?

15:16.400 --> 15:20.291
Because this is bigger than
Beyonce's beautiful baby!

15:20.293 --> 15:22.126
It's a highly-organized group of burglars.

15:22.128 --> 15:23.728
In fact, they struck again last night...

15:23.730 --> 15:25.496
Jennifer Lawrence's house.

15:25.498 --> 15:26.597
- What?
- What?

15:26.599 --> 15:28.366
What?

15:28.368 --> 15:30.468
Uh, I have to get going.

15:30.470 --> 15:32.770
You, stay strong.

15:35.607 --> 15:39.110
Hey, Cop, I gotta come clean.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.678
I'm gonna murder these cookies.

15:45.151 --> 15:46.517
You were right!

15:46.519 --> 15:47.485
Where are you guys?

15:48.488 --> 15:51.656
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

15:51.658 --> 15:54.091
Taking a picture of Nick to send to Slade.

15:54.093 --> 15:55.293
Why? He's straight.

15:55.295 --> 15:58.796
Not after he sees this picture.

15:58.798 --> 16:00.531
Don't worry, it's not about the case.

16:00.533 --> 16:01.532
I've dropped it.

16:01.534 --> 16:03.868
Well, pick it up!

16:03.870 --> 16:05.570
'Cause guess what!

16:05.572 --> 16:08.473
Slade is the leader of the Bling Ring.

16:08.475 --> 16:09.740
What are you talking about?

16:09.742 --> 16:12.677
Guess whose house was
broken into last night.

16:12.679 --> 16:14.245
Jennifer Lawrence!

16:14.247 --> 16:16.747
My hunch paid off!

16:16.749 --> 16:18.316
Ow! Careful,

16:18.318 --> 16:21.819
I have the skin of a newborn.

16:21.821 --> 16:23.615
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

16:23.617 --> 16:26.524
That we should find out
what moisturizer Nick uses?

16:26.526 --> 16:28.693
No, sting operation.

16:28.695 --> 16:31.162
I want to catch these guys in the act.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.364
Nick, text Slade and tell him

16:33.366 --> 16:35.366
that Holly Hamilton is out of town,

16:35.368 --> 16:37.368
and see if he and his
friends want to sneak in

16:37.370 --> 16:39.403
- and swim in her pool.
- Ooh, ha!

16:39.405 --> 16:43.708
I can't wait to rub this
in Duane's chiseled face.

16:43.710 --> 16:44.876
Chiseled face?

16:44.878 --> 16:48.279
I mean, I'm sure his body's chiseled, too.

16:48.281 --> 16:50.281
Oh, really. You like him, huh?

16:50.283 --> 16:52.283
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

16:52.285 --> 16:54.685
You want to touch his chisel.

16:55.450 --> 16:57.288
Oh, my God, Slade already wrote back.

16:57.290 --> 16:58.289
Well, what'd he say?

16:58.291 --> 17:00.157
"Who the hell is Holly Hamilton?"

17:01.260 --> 17:04.262
Send the link to my Wikipedia page.

17:04.263 --> 17:05.796
Good idea.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.968
A real-life sting operation.

17:10.970 --> 17:12.170
Duane's gonna be so impressed.

17:12.172 --> 17:13.503
Where is he?

17:13.506 --> 17:16.040
I told him we were having
an intervention for you.

17:16.041 --> 17:18.142
Ugh, he would never believe that.

17:18.144 --> 17:20.345
Hey, sorry I'm late.

17:22.147 --> 17:23.275
Where is everyone?

17:23.277 --> 17:27.117
Uh, I lied, there is no intervention.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.753
Oh... look, ladies, I'm flattered,

17:28.755 --> 17:31.489
but I've been in threesomes before.

17:31.491 --> 17:33.091
There are always hurt feelings.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.093
No, no, no, no.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.527
That's not why we called you here.

17:36.529 --> 17:38.563
Holly was right. She I.D.'d the Bling Ring.

17:38.565 --> 17:39.630
And they are on their way here,

17:39.632 --> 17:41.366
any minute, to rob her house.

17:41.368 --> 17:42.667
Wait, wait, wait, back up.

17:42.669 --> 17:45.303
How many threesomes have you been in?

17:45.305 --> 17:47.171
Come on, the bedroom's in here.

17:47.173 --> 17:49.207
They're coming! Hide!

17:49.209 --> 17:50.069
Where, where, where?

17:50.071 --> 17:51.275
Get under the bed, I don't know.

17:51.277 --> 17:52.443
Hurry, hurry, fast!

17:52.445 --> 17:54.812
You're so slow, oh my God.

17:54.814 --> 17:55.541
What'd I tell you guys?

17:55.543 --> 17:57.482
We got the whole place to ourselves.

17:57.484 --> 18:00.151
Nice work sliding through that gate, Nick.

18:00.153 --> 18:02.120
It was easy, I'm on a cleanse.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.188
Whoa, time to do some shopping.

18:04.190 --> 18:06.057
Yeah, well, look around, ladies.

18:06.059 --> 18:08.292
It's a 100% off sale.

18:08.294 --> 18:10.261
You guys like any of this stuff?

18:10.263 --> 18:11.496
Not really.

18:11.498 --> 18:14.799
It's like a thrift store for drag queens.

18:14.801 --> 18:16.067
Drag queens?

18:16.069 --> 18:18.102
I'm furious!

18:18.104 --> 18:19.404
Or am I flattered?

18:19.406 --> 18:21.506
I'm gonna go with flattered.

18:21.508 --> 18:22.840
This is nice.

18:22.842 --> 18:24.085
No thanks.

18:24.087 --> 18:26.344
I already have a clown
costume for Halloween.

18:26.346 --> 18:29.147
That's it, this ho is going down.

18:30.449 --> 18:31.582
Yeah, let's bounce.

18:31.584 --> 18:33.151
Yeah, I don't want to catch any ugly

18:33.153 --> 18:35.520
from these clothes.

18:35.522 --> 18:37.054
I bet if you were the fashion police,

18:37.056 --> 18:39.323
you'd do something.

18:39.325 --> 18:41.626
What about this? Do you want this?

18:41.628 --> 18:44.095
I want this.

18:44.097 --> 18:46.164
What are you waiting for? Arrest them!

18:46.166 --> 18:48.132
They didn't steal anything.

18:48.134 --> 18:50.134
I mean, I guess I can arrest the one guy

18:50.136 --> 18:52.136
- for breaking and entering.
- Do it!

18:52.138 --> 18:54.338
- I'm talking about Nick.
- Do it!

18:54.340 --> 18:56.340
Look, don't feel bad.

18:56.342 --> 18:58.609
Now that we know who they are,
I'll get them another time.

18:58.611 --> 19:00.611
Ugh, that doesn't do me any good.

19:00.613 --> 19:02.079
I wanted the glory!

19:02.081 --> 19:04.582
She does love the glory.

19:04.584 --> 19:07.251
Psst, guys!

19:07.253 --> 19:08.719
James Franco's at Sundance.

19:08.721 --> 19:11.155
We're gonna go down the
street and rob his house.

19:11.157 --> 19:12.256
I mean, they're gonna go down the street

19:12.258 --> 19:13.257
and rob his house.

19:13.259 --> 19:15.126
I'm gonna stay right here.

19:15.128 --> 19:18.095
Detective Freeman requesting backup.

19:18.097 --> 19:21.165
Yeah, 7311 Cockatoo Drive.

19:21.167 --> 19:23.568
Nice work... Detectives.

19:23.570 --> 19:25.570
This one was all Holly.

19:25.572 --> 19:27.572
Well, I guess I can share the glory...

19:27.574 --> 19:29.106
this one time.

19:30.809 --> 19:32.276
Mystery solved.

19:36.448 --> 19:38.850
- Really?
- Oh my God!

19:38.852 --> 19:40.418
- She said that?
- Yeah!

19:40.420 --> 19:41.853
What's going on here?

19:41.855 --> 19:43.321
Freeman, why didn't you tell me?

19:43.323 --> 19:45.590
"The Mystery Girls," my favorite!

19:45.592 --> 19:46.858
Well, I'm not surprised.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.993
Prisoners love me.

19:48.995 --> 19:50.195
We brought brownies.

19:50.197 --> 19:51.329
There's a key in them too.

19:51.331 --> 19:53.498
Just kidding!

19:53.500 --> 19:55.300
Is there an open back-door
we don't know about?

19:55.302 --> 19:56.968
No, but if you just jiggle the handle,

19:56.970 --> 19:58.937
it pops right open.

19:58.939 --> 20:00.404
Our phone has been ringing

20:00.406 --> 20:01.439
off the hook with cases,

20:01.441 --> 20:04.042
and we wanted to say thank
you for giving us the credit.

20:04.044 --> 20:04.909
Well, you solved it,

20:04.911 --> 20:06.044
you earned it.

20:06.046 --> 20:07.445
You can go now!

20:07.447 --> 20:08.446
Okay?

20:08.448 --> 20:09.847
Come on, let's do it.

20:09.849 --> 20:12.016
- Bye!
- And you.

20:12.018 --> 20:13.051
Come on.

20:13.053 --> 20:15.119
No, not you!

20:16.322 --> 20:17.855
Oh, uh, he hid

20:17.857 --> 20:18.957
the bodies under the "D"

20:18.959 --> 20:20.491
in the Hollywood Sign.

20:20.493 --> 20:24.095
Oh, man! That was girl
talk just between us!
