32:09.895 --> 32:11.895

32:11.964 --> 32:16.700
I think the best option
is Jeremiah and Amber.

Amber, I lost to her last season

First of all,
actually, I just wanted to talk

34:13.085 --> 34:14.518

34:14.586 --> 34:16.319
Honestly, I wouldn't
mind going to final with you.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.222
I mean, I don't
think I could beat you.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.557
I think it would
be a very close game.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.893
There are other people,
Amber B, that probably I

34:22.961 --> 34:24.394
would not want
to run the final with.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.396
But when it comes
to the Cory-Bettina situation,

34:26.465 --> 34:31.001
he told Josh that his
numbers were Priscilla,

34:31.070 --> 34:33.203
Jeremiah, Bettina and Nelson.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.638
So that's pretty much him
working

34:34.706 --> 34:36.573

- Yeah.

34:36.642 --> 34:39.242

Cory's politicking to get me

34:43.982 --> 34:45.549

So I think he had a big
hand an ending the vet [bleep],

34:48.787 --> 34:50.987
so he could keep
his numbers around.

34:51.056 --> 34:53.657
- And I think that
that is becoming really clear.

34:53.725 --> 34:54.958

stand for something.

he only wanted
to throw the ball to Jeremiah

37:32.751 --> 37:34.017

he in his friends,

37:36.722 --> 37:38.188
he's also one of his numbers.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.790
He also said his numbers
would swing big with him.

Just because now your
back's against the wall.

37:52.137 --> 37:54.104
This is typical Ashley behavior.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.549
I've never backstabbed anyone.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.285
- You wear snake
earrings around the house,

38:08.353 --> 38:09.753
you love to proclaim

38:11.123 --> 38:12.055
- You love that.

38:12.124 --> 38:13.590
You wear that
as a badge of honor.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.325
- Okay, yeah.
Well then, who did I snake?

38:15.394 --> 38:18.428
Who did I snake?

38:18.497 --> 38:20.330
Cory calls me a snake,
which is absolutely

38:20.399 --> 38:22.899

he has no facts.

No proof of anything
besides that he's working

38:27.339 --> 38:28.905

You wear that

38:39.484 --> 38:41.051

38:41.119 --> 38:44.487
- It's crazy that the decision
to not split a million dollars

38:44.556 --> 38:49.092
with my literal worst enemy has
came back to haunt me so much.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.895
Because everybody
in this game tells me

38:51.963 --> 38:53.396
they would have
done the same thing.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.832
<i> - Yeah, she took</i>
<i> the money from her partner.</i>

38:55.901 --> 38:59.903
But if you're going
to use a decision she made

38:59.971 --> 39:02.172
a long time ago
in a game where it

39:02.240 --> 39:04.607
doesn't apply,
you're just reaching for straws.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.875
- Can I interject?

39:05.944 --> 39:08.011
Because no
one in here that's undecided is

39:08.080 --> 39:09.746
going to decide based
off of personal attacks.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.281
- Yeah.

39:11.350 --> 39:15.585
- I just want some clarification
because the big point is whether

39:15.654 --> 39:19.155
or not there was any
instruction or conversation

39:19.224 --> 39:22.892
with Priscilla to keep
a rookie-rookie team alive.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.995
- I can clear that up.
One thing I'm not is a sheep.

39:26.064 --> 39:29.766
The move I made was
only for my own reasons.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.001
So let's pump
the brakes on that.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.670
I didn't speak
to Cory about that at all.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.305
I spoke to Nelson and told him,

39:35.374 --> 39:37.207
are you okay
with me switching partners?

39:37.275 --> 39:40.076
- I'm not buying it
for a second.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.045
I can tell Priscilla's lying.

39:42.114 --> 39:43.747
And that just
solidified my vote.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.949
- I mean, it's pretty clear
all the vets work together.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.450
We had this alliance,
that's how we got to this point.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.986
But when you snatch
the ball from me and you hand it

39:50.055 --> 39:51.454
to a rookie,
we start to think--

39:51.523 --> 39:52.956
- We got to stop [bleep]
bringing up the Mud Pit.

39:53.024 --> 39:55.225
He was attached to Tori,
so if anything I was trying

39:56.228 --> 39:57.460
- The reason why
I'm bringing it up,

39:57.529 --> 39:59.195
we have to make
a decision and when things like

39:59.264 --> 40:01.598
that happen, it felt
like where does that leave me?

40:01.666 --> 40:04.467
- For the vets in this room,
if you think I'm not playing

40:04.536 --> 40:07.237
ball with you guys,
that's ridiculous right now.

40:07.305 --> 40:09.672
I have been all about
this and I'm so [bleep]

40:09.741 --> 40:11.207
proud to be a vet.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.610
And I'm so happy that we have
played this game

40:13.678 --> 40:15.011
the way that we have.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.546
- Then why did you
throw the ball to Jeremiah?

40:16.615 --> 40:18.081
- Because he was by my rope.

40:18.150 --> 40:19.149
- Why didn't
you throw it to Kyle?

40:19.217 --> 40:20.283
- Because Kyle
was playing with Josh.

40:20.352 --> 40:21.918
- Kyle's a vet,
Jeremiah's a rookie.

40:21.987 --> 40:25.889
- These people are
searching for bull[bleep].

40:25.957 --> 40:28.324
They are picking
every little thing because

40:28.393 --> 40:30.226
they just don't
want me in this game.

40:30.295 --> 40:33.363
- Amanda, how can you
sit here and defend Ashley?

40:33.432 --> 40:36.866
You sacrifice yourself to go
in for her and she

40:36.935 --> 40:38.535
stole half million dollars
from our friend

40:38.603 --> 40:42.739
and she only sent you a [bleep]
$500 gift card, that's it.

40:42.808 --> 40:43.807
- Why are you mad about that?

40:43.875 --> 40:45.008
- That's bull[bleep].

40:45.076 --> 40:46.209
Because that's so selfish,
you're the

40:46.278 --> 40:47.677
most selfishest
person to play this game.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.746
Everybody knows in the room
she'll say anything to anybody

40:49.815 --> 40:51.014
to make it to another final.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.649
That's why
she's always eliminated

40:52.717 --> 40:53.783
at the beginning
of "The Challenge."

40:53.852 --> 40:55.251
- Doesn't matter,
she's my friend.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.120
- She's your friend?
- Yeah, she is my friend.

40:57.189 --> 40:58.555
- A friend that gave
you $500 after winning

40:58.623 --> 41:01.157
a million dollars,
how you can call that a friend?

41:01.226 --> 41:04.027

50:48.146 --> 50:50.012
- Don't rush.
- Slower.

50:50.081 --> 50:54.016
-Amber's doing this long
crab walk thing and it's not

50:54.085 --> 50:56.085
<i> the prettiest</i>
<i> technique but it's working,</i>

50:56.154 --> 51:00.489
so kudos to them,
they figured something out.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.258
- Stop.

51:02.326 --> 51:04.160
<i> - Amber takes the lead.</i>

51:04.228 --> 51:05.928
She basically wears
the pants in the elimination

51:05.997 --> 51:07.763
probably like she
does in their relationship.

51:07.832 --> 51:10.066
And she's telling him
what to do and he's listening.

51:11.502 --> 51:12.635
- See how she's doing it?

51:12.703 --> 51:14.804
- Yeah, let's try it.

51:14.872 --> 51:16.806
- Good job.

51:16.874 --> 51:18.274
<i> - Me and Amber</i>
<i> got it figured it out.</i>

51:18.342 --> 51:19.742
<i> We've got a good thing going.</i>

51:19.811 --> 51:22.011
We know what to do,
so let's go down here,

51:22.080 --> 51:25.781
get these other pieces, and use
the same strategy we just used.

51:25.850 --> 51:28.017
- Good work, guys.
Good [bleep] work.

51:28.086 --> 51:29.485
- It's too much,
that's too much of a step.

51:29.554 --> 51:30.920
- Nice and easy,
nice and easy.

51:30.988 --> 51:33.355
- Amber and Jeremiah look
like they're doing really well

51:33.424 --> 51:37.193
but I can tell their
strategy is not sustainable.

51:37.261 --> 51:40.196
Being that low and causing
that much stress on his lower

51:40.264 --> 51:42.698
back is just not
going to be able to hold up.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.667
- There you go,
you're almost there.

51:44.735 --> 51:49.238
You're almost there.

51:49.307 --> 51:52.341
- I'm worried right now
for Cory and Bettina because

51:52.410 --> 51:53.943
they're not
getting the job done.

51:54.011 --> 51:56.178
<i> But you know what they say</i>
<i> about elimination,</i>

51:56.247 --> 51:57.580
<i> you never give up.</i>

51:57.648 --> 51:59.782
If one thing is
not working, adapt.

51:59.851 --> 52:01.217
Try something else.

52:01.285 --> 52:02.284
- Hold it.
- Yep.

52:02.353 --> 52:05.321
- Hold it.

52:05.389 --> 52:08.924
- Good job.
- Yeah.

- God damn.

keep it up.

52:14.799 --> 52:15.965
<i> - After changing the strategy,</i>

52:16.033 --> 52:17.933
it was like we
got new fight in us.

52:18.002 --> 52:20.803
Like, this is it.
We will take them.

52:24.609 --> 52:25.808
- Stay up, Amber.

52:25.877 --> 52:27.977
<i> - I want this so bad.</i>

52:28.045 --> 52:30.112
<i> I'm just a target and people</i>

52:30.181 --> 52:31.647

52:31.716 --> 52:33.582
to myself that
I have everything

52:33.651 --> 52:35.484
in me to come
back into this game.

52:35.553 --> 52:39.788
- Oh, Amber's [indistinct].

52:39.857 --> 52:42.191

53:06.751 --> 53:08.717
This is honestly hilarious.

53:43.688 --> 53:45.454
- Get that last one.

53:45.523 --> 53:47.656
Kiss me.

53:52.396 --> 53:55.631
- The more you go,

can't take anymore.

- Bettina.

54:11.215 --> 54:12.948

54:13.017 --> 54:14.149
- Fatigue is
getting to me right now.

You know,
me having to bend down to hold

54:16.020 --> 54:19.555
her up to balance me,
it's taking a toll on my back.

- Guys, this is what do
you trained for, let's go.

- Shake it off.

54:43.714 --> 54:44.947
- Go Cory.

54:45.016 --> 54:47.016
- We finally hit
a moment where we say, okay,

54:47.084 --> 54:49.318
let's switch up our
strategy

54:49.387 --> 54:51.987
<i> and let's hold</i>

54:52.056 --> 54:56.292

you've got the rhythm.

55:20.685 --> 55:22.184
You know what to do.

55:22.253 --> 55:27.323

so she started to make, like,

<i> two, one, two with Cory.</i>

55:29.627 --> 55:31.393

Lean back, lean back.

56:00.257 --> 56:02.391
- Cory and Bettina
are down significantly

56:02.460 --> 56:06.195
but out of nowhere,
they got the rhythm,

56:06.263 --> 56:09.531
methodically moving across
this beam, trusting each other,

56:09.600 --> 56:13.335
they got their balance in check
and this is anybody's race.

Focus and count.

change down there.

Oh, my Lord,
I did not see this coming.

56:54.779 --> 56:56.478

these are in the middle.

56:56.547 --> 56:58.914

56:58.983 --> 57:00.949
I know my strengths

57:01.018 --> 57:02.484
And this is one
of my weaknesses.

57:02.553 --> 57:05.354
- C'mon,
you gotta put it in the hole.

57:05.423 --> 57:07.956

57:08.025 --> 57:10.159
Like, both of my hands
are shaking.

57:10.227 --> 57:12.261
- I just know my body
is giving out on me

57:12.329 --> 57:14.997
and my mind is telling
me something else,

57:15.065 --> 57:17.399
so the two aren't working
together and it's frustrating.

57:17.468 --> 57:19.802

one go in the middle?

<i> - They better watch out</i>
<i> because we're coming back,</i>

58:35.379 --> 58:37.212
we remember that
we were the house vote,

58:37.281 --> 58:40.082
we know that people don't
want us in that house so we plan

58:40.150 --> 58:42.484

switching up teams

58:42.553 --> 58:44.253
and hopefully
putting a stamp on it.

Unfortunately you lost
tonight's elimination round,

deactivated immediately.

Best believe I'll be
back because I'm not done yet.

never thought
about doing before.

59:10.481 --> 59:12.147
<i> I conquered my fears here.</i>

We gave it our all, we left it

<i> so I'm not mad at it.</i>

59:15.352 --> 59:16.585

So, you know,
that's a win for me.

59:20.224 --> 59:22.457

elimination round.

- That was awesome.
- Just a couple of badasses.

59:30.334 --> 59:33.769
You were way, way behind,
came back and got it done.

59:33.837 --> 59:35.170
That was impressive.

59:35.239 --> 59:38.640
So now, by winning
tonight's elimination round...

59:41.445 --> 59:45.480
- TJ, go ahead and ask me,
who do I want as my partner,

59:45.549 --> 59:47.215
because I'm
about to shake it up.

59:49.153 --> 59:52.254
- I'm hoping that
Cory does not pick me.

59:52.323 --> 59:54.556
I'm hoping that he picks Tori.

59:56.360 --> 59:58.827
- If Bettina picks me,
it's gonna be short-lived.

59:58.896 --> 1:00:00.262
I'll make damn sure of that.

1:00:00.331 --> 1:00:01.997
- You can rejoin the group.

1:00:03.968 --> 1:00:06.068
Yeah, rejoin the group,
go ahead.

1:00:06.136 --> 1:00:09.438
- What?
- What?

1:00:09.506 --> 1:00:13.475
- TJ, what do you mean,
go back with the group?

1:00:13.544 --> 1:00:16.612
- I won't--what?
- Just go ahead up there.

1:00:18.682 --> 1:00:21.283
- TJ, you definitely
skipped the whole stealing part.

1:00:21.352 --> 1:00:22.451
You know,
when you win elimination,

1:00:22.519 --> 1:00:24.152
you get to steal a partner,
that part?

1:00:26.457 --> 1:00:30.192
- What is going on, my man?
What is the game plan here?

1:00:31.528 --> 1:00:33.562
- It's a prank.
- No, it's not.

1:00:33.631 --> 1:00:36.398
- Oh, [bleep].

1:00:36.467 --> 1:00:38.000
- But I don't have a partner.

1:00:38.068 --> 1:00:39.968
- I don't have
a partner right now.

1:00:40.037 --> 1:00:42.804
So, like, does that mean that,
like, we're gonna pick new--

1:00:42.873 --> 1:00:46.241
I have--I have literally
no idea what's going to happen.

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:48.944
No clue.
I--and my brain is just bleh.

1:00:49.013 --> 1:00:51.246
- [laughs]
- Holy [bleep].

1:00:51.315 --> 1:00:52.914
- Something is going on.

1:00:52.983 --> 1:00:53.882
- Is it good?
Is it bad?

1:00:53.951 --> 1:00:55.117
I don't know.

1:00:57.254 --> 1:00:58.887
- What's going on, brother?

1:00:58.956 --> 1:01:00.489
- All right, agents.

1:01:00.557 --> 1:01:03.258
In this game,
you have to be prepared

1:01:03.327 --> 1:01:05.060
for anything
that comes your way.

1:01:07.931 --> 1:01:09.164
I'll see you soon.

1:01:09.233 --> 1:01:10.532
- What?. I don't--what?

1:01:10.601 --> 1:01:11.900
- Oh, no.

1:01:11.969 --> 1:01:14.503
- Oh, my God.

1:01:14.571 --> 1:01:17.305
[chatter]

1:01:17.374 --> 1:01:19.007
- Time and time again,
this game has

1:01:19.076 --> 1:01:20.742
taught me that I
don't know a thing.

1:01:24.448 --> 1:01:26.682
- My heart can't take it.

1:01:28.752 --> 1:01:30.085
- I don't think we're playing
teams anymore.

1:01:30.154 --> 1:01:32.154
<i> - We have some people</i>
<i> who are partnerless.</i>

1:01:32.222 --> 1:01:34.189
<i> We don't know what</i>
<i> is going on at this point.</i>

1:01:34.258 --> 1:01:36.758
<i> - Now, I've told you</i>
<i> time and time again</i>

1:01:36.827 --> 1:01:41.029
<i> be ready for anything</i>
<i> at any time.</i>

1:01:41.098 --> 1:01:42.464
Agents, it's time to adapt.

1:01:42.533 --> 1:01:44.099
<i> - I'm expecting some kind of</i>
<i> news.</i>

1:01:44.168 --> 1:01:45.200
- From now on...

1:01:45.269 --> 1:01:47.035
[together] Oh!
- I am shocked.
