When you've spent your life
around A-list actors,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.611

02:13.655 --> 02:15.874

who's real,

of what's important.

03:35.954 --> 03:38.218
Huh?
We need to have a talk.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.307
That man in there means
the world to me,

03:40.350 --> 03:42.265
and even the sound
of your name

03:42.309 --> 03:43.832
makes the light
go out in his eyes.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.921
Yeah.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.533
That's why I don't want you
anywhere near my wedding.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.056
Vivica?
Ah, ah.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.189
I said what I said.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.843
Don't you try to play me, Diane.

03:56.888 --> 04:00.370
Let me get one more
slice of that delicious cake.

04:02.067 --> 04:06.594
How many "Set It Off" cast
members am I gonna feud with?

04:06.637 --> 04:10.554
Charlie, man, I've never seen
you this happy before,

04:10.598 --> 04:12.513
but there is a sparkle
in your eye,

04:12.556 --> 04:16.256
a pep in your step,
and not a stain on your shirt.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.301
Thank you so much
for doing this for us, Dre.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.347
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, I really, really

04:20.390 --> 04:23.132
appreciate it,
so much so, man,

04:23.175 --> 04:26.831

05:28.328 --> 05:30.330
You have really outdone
yourself, Dre.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.722
Well...

05:31.766 --> 05:34.334
Well, all I did
was secure a suite,

05:34.377 --> 05:37.511
a rare tequila tasting,
our own private blackjack table,

05:37.554 --> 05:40.035
and front row seats
to see David Blaine

05:40.078 --> 05:41.819
stick a skewer
through his cheek.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.343
- Nice.
- Anybody could've did that.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.475
Can you believe him?

05:45.519 --> 05:47.608
He literally opened
up his laptop for five minutes

05:47.651 --> 05:48.609
and booked a concierge.

05:48.652 --> 05:49.784
<i>That's so your dad.</i>

your Cirque du Soleil
tickets, son.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.224

and then we're gonna saddle up

05:58.445 --> 05:59.837
and take a ride
around the casino.

- Got it.

Wink, wink.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.364

Hey, I'm the best man.
I don't half-step.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.066

06:11.109 --> 06:12.110
feel special,
don't you?

06:14.417 --> 06:16.985
And that same special feeling,
I want Vivica to feel

06:17.028 --> 06:19.509
when I put that ring
- on her finger, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.032
So,
if it's cool with you,

06:21.076 --> 06:22.773
I need to hold down 10 Gs,
my man.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.209
What?

06:24.253 --> 06:26.473
Oh, I'm sorry.
My <i>best</i> man.

06:26.516 --> 06:28.170
Hell no.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.086
What? Look, I got
a Hollywood girl right now.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.305
I can't be buying her
no North Hollywood ring.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.438
Charlie, are you out
of your damn mind?

06:35.482 --> 06:38.354
What makes you think that I
would let you hold 10 grand?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.921
Why wouldn't you?
You're my best friend.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.271
Who else would I ask?

06:42.314 --> 06:43.968
You think
I'm your best friend?

06:44.012 --> 06:46.231
Yeah.
Charlie, how can we
be best friends?

06:46.275 --> 06:47.929
I don't know your birthday. I
don't know your favorite color.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.800
I-I've never been
to your crib.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.411
- Have you ever asked?
- Come on, Charlie.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.978
You're great,
but we work together, man.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.416
We're not frat brothers.
We don't vacation together.

06:56.459 --> 06:59.593
I mean, I'm not even sure
you get my Christmas cards.

06:59.636 --> 07:02.944
Um...

07:02.987 --> 07:05.033
I guess I made a miscalculation.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.339
Okay, don't ask me why,

07:07.383 --> 07:10.168
but, uh,
I got a lot more energy

07:10.212 --> 07:12.257
than I did before,
and, uh, I'm gonna feel

07:12.301 --> 07:13.824
a lot sadder
in about two hours,

07:13.868 --> 07:15.913
so let's party
before this wears off.

07:15.957 --> 07:16.827
Come on!
Whoo!

07:16.871 --> 07:18.568
- Come on!
- Party!

07:18.612 --> 07:21.223
Prostitutes!
Whoo!

07:21.266 --> 07:22.267
Hmm.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.751
Dre: Babe.
Hey.

07:27.795 --> 07:31.059
So, I didn't get any phone calls
from the credit card company

07:31.102 --> 07:33.017
about suspicious activity
on our card.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.019
Did you not
have fun last night?

07:35.063 --> 07:36.586
I did not. Oh.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.675
But there's a reason
I don't hang out

07:38.719 --> 07:40.547
with those people
after the bank closes.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.680
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Here comes another Dre story.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.116
What's Johan doing here?

07:45.160 --> 07:46.901
What? I can't come visit
my favorite sister

07:46.944 --> 07:48.119
without you giving me
a hard time?

07:48.163 --> 07:49.512
Mm.

07:49.556 --> 07:52.036
Fine.
Had to leave India.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.864
Told the wrong person
to Namaste.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.997
Ah.
That's more like it.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.479
So, how was it, Dre?
What happened?

07:59.522 --> 08:02.351
I mean, you guys must've been
like red meat for the con-women.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.048
You know what?

08:04.092 --> 08:06.398
Charlie lost his damn mind.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.750
Oh.
He thinks
he is my best friend.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.407
- Your best friend?
- Mm-hmm.

08:15.451 --> 08:16.974
Dre, that's crazy.
You don't have any friends.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.454
Yeah.
Yes, I do.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.456
- Who?
- I've never seen you converse with one friend.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.849
Unh-unh.

08:21.892 --> 08:24.112
Dre, come on, you lost
your phone for three days,

08:24.155 --> 08:26.506
and the only missed call
was from Domino's.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.160
That's because my friend,
Willie, works there.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.901
Face it, Dre,
since we've been married,

08:30.945 --> 08:32.250
you only hang out
with me.

08:32.294 --> 08:35.166
What? If anything,
I have too many friends.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.560
- Hmm.
- Charlie thinks he's my number one.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.996
He's not even
in my top 10.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.084
Huh.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.999
So, you think
you have enough friends

08:42.043 --> 08:44.611
for a five-on-five
basketball game?

08:44.654 --> 08:46.134
- I do.
- Name them.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.005
I will. Okay.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.224
T-Will.
Mm-hmm.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.138
Ronnie.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.966
Ladarius, Tony.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.359
Gigi, Sha,
Cousin Gary.

08:54.403 --> 08:55.622
No.
Pizza Willie.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.362
That's...

08:57.406 --> 08:58.842
Me.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.583
Dre, you haven't seen any
of those people in years,

09:00.627 --> 09:01.932
and one of them is dead.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.586
RIP Tony.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.197
Mm-hmm. And you hang out
with Charlie all the time.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.591
Because of work.
Alright?

09:08.635 --> 09:11.289
Babe, I'm like doughnuts
in that office.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.074
Okay.
Everybody loves me.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.597
- Mm-hmm.
- Charlie ain't special.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.425
Okay.

09:16.468 --> 09:19.210
Great. Now that we've solved
that, I'll be in your bathroom.

09:19.254 --> 09:22.300
- Hmm.
- I need to make sure no parasites followed me back from Bengal.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.389
Yeah.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.565
Ew.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.005
All this stuff happened yesterday.

09:31.048 --> 09:33.224
I mean,
why do people read this?

09:33.268 --> 09:34.661
Hey.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.271
Since we're not going
to Charles' wedding,

09:36.314 --> 09:38.099
should we all get tickets
to Splash Down Falls?

09:38.142 --> 09:39.535
Hmm?

09:39.579 --> 09:40.841
Look, they're double-bleaching
the lazy river now,

09:40.884 --> 09:42.190
so no one should get
an infection.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.278
Oh, I'm going
to that wedding.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.496
Oh, yeah, me, too.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.021
I love love
and free food.
Mm-hmm.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.979
So, you guys are just gonna
leave Jack and I behind

09:49.023 --> 09:50.502
like we're not a part
of this family?

09:50.546 --> 09:52.026
I mean... Oh.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.549
Mm...

09:53.593 --> 09:55.203
Are you kidding me?

09:55.246 --> 09:57.771
Jack, I would never go to a
party if you weren't invited.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.947
You only go to parties
if I'm <i>not</i> invited.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.949
Well, you're unpopular.
That's not my fault.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.299
Okay, I'm sorry, but you're on
the haters list, not me.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.996
Wow.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.824
Why do you want to go so bad,
anyway?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.391
Yeah.
I don't.
I couldn't care less.

10:09.434 --> 10:10.827
Oh, sounds like
you care.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.307
You don't know me, hippie.

10:12.350 --> 10:15.440
Okay, look, Diane, if you want
to go to the wedding,

10:15.484 --> 10:16.964
you just gotta make things right
with Charlie.

10:17.007 --> 10:18.922
Yeah. Vivica just wants him
to be happy.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.621
I mean, maybe if you
and Charlie are cool,

10:21.664 --> 10:22.926
she'll be okay
with you going.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.059
Pass.
Enjoy your stupid wedding.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.713
I hope it's a buffet
and your table goes last.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.149
Mm-hmm.

10:28.192 --> 10:31.761
Wow. What happened with her
and Charlie, anyway?

10:31.805 --> 10:35.112
Well, it's complicated,
but it all started when...

10:36.461 --> 10:39.334
Oh! Hey, babe.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.683
Sorry, gotta take this.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.381
Oh, yo,
I am in front of family.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.910
Dre: <i>Bow made her argument,</i>

10:49.953 --> 10:52.173
<i>but it wasn't my fault</i> <i>
that Charlie didn't understand</i>

10:52.216 --> 10:54.262
<i>what our friendship was</i> <i>
and wasn't.</i>

10:54.305 --> 10:56.090
<i>And truth?</i>

10:56.133 --> 10:58.832
<i>Everybody at the office thought</i> <i>
I was their best friend.</i>

10:58.875 --> 11:00.572
James.

11:00.616 --> 11:03.837
Can you explain to me this
whole, uh, overnight oats thing?

11:03.880 --> 11:06.448
Uh, well, you just pour the milk
on top of the oats

11:06.491 --> 11:08.885
and let them sit in
the refrigerator overnight.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.365
Oh, oh,
what about the fruit?

11:10.408 --> 11:13.020
Do you put that on before,
or do you put it on after?

11:13.063 --> 11:15.500
I don't know, man.
I didn't go to oatmeal college.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.417
Oatmeal college.

11:21.071 --> 11:23.073
Oh, wow, Maddie.
Look at this.

11:23.117 --> 11:26.033
Uh, Bow is asking about doing
Thanksgiving at her mom's.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.382
Who's Bow?

11:27.425 --> 11:29.906
Come on. I thought you knew
that was my wife.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.691
How would I
possibly know that?

11:31.734 --> 11:35.259
Well, you know, Bow thinks we
spend more time with my family,

11:35.303 --> 11:38.262
but it's not my fault
that her family sucks.

11:38.306 --> 11:42.092
You know, what am I to do
to keep the peace?

11:42.136 --> 11:43.964
You should do
whatever your wife wants.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.400
She's not asking
for much.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.880
- Yeah.
- Marriage is a partnership.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.272
Yeah. It is.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.752
But you know, her mom --
you know, she wears these

11:49.796 --> 11:52.799
hippie robes, and not all of
them have belts on them.

11:52.842 --> 11:53.974
So, when I come
downstairs --

11:54.017 --> 11:56.716
boom -- you know,
everything is out there,

11:56.759 --> 11:59.066
and I mean...everything.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.589
I really think
that's something

12:00.632 --> 12:02.678
you should talk about
with your friends.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.854
I-I thought we were
chopping it up.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.291
W-We should go
to that meeting.

12:07.335 --> 12:08.162
Uh --Yes.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.380
In the room.
In that room.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.947
In that room?

12:10.991 --> 12:12.775
Mm. Okay.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.780
Mother-in-laws.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.869
Am I right?

12:19.913 --> 12:22.829
Okay. Huh.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.266
<i>So, maybe my coworkers and I</i>

12:25.309 --> 12:27.703
<i>were still getting</i> <i>
to know each other.</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:31.576
<i>I still had more than enough</i> <i>
friends to not miss Charlie.</i>

12:31.620 --> 12:34.797
<i>I slept on it, and I came</i> <i>
to the same conclusion.</i>

12:34.841 --> 12:38.453
<i>Work is a place of business,</i> <i>
not a clubhouse.</i>

12:42.065 --> 12:45.852

Seriously, you guys don't

12:47.854 --> 12:49.725
Well --
It's cool, Dre.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.249
I got this.

12:52.293 --> 12:53.511
- You know what word I miss?
- Hmm?

12:53.555 --> 12:54.599
"Colored."
Oh.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.210
- Oh!
- Whoo! Whoo!

12:56.253 --> 12:57.428
Stevens: Okay.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.690
- No, no, no!
- What's up?

12:58.734 --> 13:00.388

13:00.431 --> 13:02.564

13:02.607 --> 13:05.785
This is exactly what
I imagined heaven to be like.

13:05.828 --> 13:08.918
This is my hell.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.441
Hey, brothers!

13:10.485 --> 13:12.269
Y'all looking good.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.576

Uh, maybe this
is just my pee face.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.681
No.
I know your pee face.

13:32.724 --> 13:33.987
There's something else

♪ Feel the same way, too

13:35.379 --> 13:36.685

for barbecue,

13:38.295 --> 13:41.342
I thought it was to <i>eat</i>
barbecue, not watch barbecue.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.431
This is better.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.043
Hello, Mama.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.653
Charlie, how the hell
did you get in here?

13:48.697 --> 13:49.959
This is not weird.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.352
My Mama's
inside your baby.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.835
Aw, damn.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.793
Charlie is my best friend.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.624
Grown men
don't have best friends.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.408
Unless it's a dog.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.149
We're being raised
by a 10-year-old.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.719
<i>I had broken</i> <i>
my best friend's heart,</i>

14:10.762 --> 14:12.764
<i>but I knew I could fix it.</i>

14:15.202 --> 14:17.030
Oh -- Oh, hey.
Hey, have you seen Charlie?

14:18.248 --> 14:21.034
You know, I-I wanted
to apologize and, uh,

14:21.077 --> 14:24.037
let him know that I'm honored
to be his best man.

14:24.080 --> 14:27.301
Yeah, uh, it's a little late
for that, Dad.

14:27.344 --> 14:30.304
Uh, Charlie asked me
to be his best man.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.915
What?
And his lawyer.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.092
Told him not to let me handle
the prenup negotiations.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.268
Huh?

14:41.532 --> 14:43.273
What do you mean
you're Charlie's best man?

14:44.666 --> 14:46.450
Listen, I'm sorry, Dad,
but you blew it, alright?

14:46.494 --> 14:48.017
He turned to me.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.324
Well, actually, he turned
to his Starbucks barista,

14:50.367 --> 14:53.109
Brendan, but he had
a prior conflict.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.155
Although, he did send
the entire wedding party

14:55.198 --> 14:56.504
their favorite drinks.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.549
He's a great guy.
They go way back.

14:58.593 --> 15:01.552
Anyway, I've already got the
rings in my pocket, and, uh,

15:01.596 --> 15:04.338
in case you're wondering, you
missed out on a very nice flask.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.470
- Let me just talk to him.
- No, no, no, no.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.385
I don't think so.
Alright?

15:08.429 --> 15:09.691
Step away from the door.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.911
You really hurt Charlie.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.000
He was broken.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.524
Luckily, Brendan and I were
there to pick up the pieces.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.047
Look,
I know I messed up,

15:18.091 --> 15:19.483
but, Charlie,
if you give me one more ch--

15:19.527 --> 15:21.007
Mnh-mnh!

15:21.050 --> 15:23.661
Today of all days,
Charlie deserves to be up there

15:23.705 --> 15:26.142
with someone he trusts.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.404
But he trusts me.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.710
Mnh-mnh.

15:28.753 --> 15:32.409
Dad, don't embarrass
yourself, alright?

15:32.453 --> 15:34.020
Now, I gotta go.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.935
I gotta find "White Hennessy,"
which at first

15:35.978 --> 15:38.198
I thought was a liquor,
but turns out to be a guest.

15:39.939 --> 15:44.334
<i>I had missed my chance to make</i> <i>
things right with Charlie.</i>

15:44.378 --> 15:48.295
<i>I messed everything up, and he</i> <i>
was moving on without me.</i>

15:50.123 --> 15:52.212
I don't need
this funky wedding.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.042
Diane?

15:58.305 --> 16:00.307
What are you doing
working this wedding?

16:00.350 --> 16:03.353
Well, I had to go incognito
since Vivica banned me.

16:03.397 --> 16:06.008
And can you believe she put
my picture in every entrance?

16:06.052 --> 16:08.271
Like anyone could keep me
from missing this train wreck.

16:08.315 --> 16:10.012
Why you over here
looking all sad?

16:12.232 --> 16:15.278
You know, Charlie's been
a great friend to me,

16:15.322 --> 16:17.150
and I took it
for granted.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.065
Well, that's no big loss.
The guy's a dud.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.980
No, no, no.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.591
Diane, he's not, though.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.419
He's funny.
He's loyal.

16:25.462 --> 16:28.248
He -- He listens
to all my problems,

16:28.291 --> 16:30.728
and he knows me better than
anybody outside of my family.

16:32.556 --> 16:37.039
And I never took the time
to appreciate what we had.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.695
Normally...
I would say forget him.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.653
He's a drain of resources
on this county,

16:42.697 --> 16:44.003
state, and humanity.

16:46.309 --> 16:48.181
But it seems like
Charlie means a lot to you.

16:50.313 --> 16:53.229
While I disagree
with that decision,

16:53.273 --> 16:55.188
it's not every day
your friend gets married.

16:57.407 --> 16:58.408
You're right, Diane.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.108
Maybe the best thing
that I can do for Charlie

17:02.151 --> 17:05.633
is to just sit back and watch
my best friend get married.

17:07.852 --> 17:11.117
That was some pretty mature
advice you just gave me.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.597
Thank you. Alright.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.817
Well, I better get back in there
and do place settings

17:15.860 --> 17:17.210
or Jerry's
gonna have my ass.

17:17.253 --> 17:18.994
Mm-hmm.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.866
<i>Even if Charlie</i> <i>
didn't want me up there,</i>

17:21.910 --> 17:24.652
<i>I could still celebrate</i> <i>
with him on his day.</i>

17:24.695 --> 17:26.654
Wait, so no one's gonna
talk about

17:26.697 --> 17:28.134
Babyface
officiating this wedding?

17:28.177 --> 17:29.222
- Shh.
- Like, we're just gonna let that rock?

17:29.265 --> 17:30.397
Shut up.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.878
Welcome, family, friends,
tender lovers.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.706
Aww.
Mm.

17:35.750 --> 17:39.275
So, the bride and groom have
chosen to write their own vows.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.668
Please.

17:41.930 --> 17:45.716
Vivica, I promise
to love and obey,

17:45.760 --> 17:48.850
and do anything that you want me
to do, whatever it is.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.331
I don't care.
I am not proud.

17:51.374 --> 17:54.029
I would do it.
You just ask.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.770
As long
as you don't leave me.

17:55.813 --> 18:00.296
My Charlie I can't wait
to spend my life with you.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.908
You have made me
the happiest woman in the world.

18:05.345 --> 18:06.650
And I want to send
a special shout-out

18:06.694 --> 18:09.000
to the Disney Corporation
for allowing us

18:09.044 --> 18:12.830
to use this set from my
upcoming film, "Holy Alimony",

18:12.874 --> 18:14.919
in theaters,
streaming next June.

18:14.963 --> 18:17.139
Soundtrack
produced by Babyface,

18:17.183 --> 18:19.315
featuring the single,
"What's Up, Prenup?"

18:19.359 --> 18:22.188
- Hey.
- That explains why Michael Ealy's in the program.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.494
Oh.
Babyface:
Now, Charlie,

18:24.538 --> 18:28.194
do you promise to think of
Vivica on two occasions.

18:28.237 --> 18:31.893
♪ That's day and night

18:31.936 --> 18:36.071
♪ Would you go for broke
if she could be with you? ♪

18:36.115 --> 18:40.336
Whoo!♪ Only you can make it right

18:43.383 --> 18:47.169

I'd ever seen Charlie,</i>

18:47.213 --> 18:48.475

the point of the day.</i>

18:55.351 --> 18:57.223
Everyone...

18:57.266 --> 18:59.181
...I want to thank everyone
for coming out today.

18:59.225 --> 19:02.489
I really appreciate you all.
Thank you so, so much, man.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.926
And to my Uncle Roy's
parole officer,

19:04.969 --> 19:07.058
thank you so much
for bringing him.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.060
- We really thank you.
- Someone's in jail?

19:09.104 --> 19:12.934
And to my beautiful,
wonderful bride,

19:12.977 --> 19:14.544
this special dance
is for you, baby.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.508
Oh, h-hey, girl.
Yeah, I gotta take this.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.074
What do you mean
you gotta take this?

19:23.118 --> 19:25.729
Where are you going?
We rehearsed this.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.209
Who's gonna take
your place?

19:36.523 --> 19:38.089
What are you doing here?

19:38.133 --> 19:39.308
Stepping up.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.702
After all,
I am your best friend.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.094
That means a lot.
Thank you.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.663
But, uh, what about them
10 Gs, though?

19:46.707 --> 19:48.970
Worry about that later.

you and I are square.

Thank you, Diane.

Wow. To think this all
started because y--

21:11.357 --> 21:14.360
Vivica:
Charlie, the limo's here!

21:14.403 --> 21:17.058
Stay menacing, kid.

21:17.101 --> 21:18.364
It looks good on you.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.806
I'm gonna flood his house
while he's gone.
