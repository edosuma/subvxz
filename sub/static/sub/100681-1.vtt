(bird cawing)

00:04.938 --> 00:07.438
(tense music)

00:09.024 --> 00:11.671
- [Narrator] They say there's
a secret world out there.

00:11.671 --> 00:13.781
Some seek to find it,

00:13.781 --> 00:16.548
some get consumed by it,

00:16.548 --> 00:20.805
while others hide from it.
(tribal singing)

00:20.805 --> 00:22.916
I read somewhere that
Native American myths

00:22.916 --> 00:25.666
were created to teach us lessons.

00:26.758 --> 00:28.913
They're connections to the past

00:28.913 --> 00:32.746
sharing spiritual bond
between us and animals.

00:34.845 --> 00:38.156
Though people have separated
themselves from nature,

00:38.156 --> 00:40.906
like it was alien, the human mind

00:41.792 --> 00:46.125
can experience some of the
most amazing phenomenons.

00:47.483 --> 00:49.776
Maybe it's our fear of the dark

00:49.776 --> 00:53.946
that allows our imagination
to fill in the blanks.

00:53.946 --> 00:57.241
But what we can't explain,
(tribal chanting)

00:57.241 --> 00:59.085
the confusion comes when you try

00:59.085 --> 01:02.167
to define those experiences
(birds cawing)

01:02.167 --> 01:03.417
as real or not.

01:06.225 --> 01:08.975

All right you guys, don't forget

01:38.045 --> 01:41.095
your projects are due
after spring break, okay.

01:41.095 --> 01:42.396
No excuses.

01:42.396 --> 01:45.396
(people chattering)

01:48.043 --> 01:50.224
- Did you get the information
for our trip girl?

01:50.224 --> 01:51.427
- Yeah.

01:51.427 --> 01:52.721
I can't wait.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.971
- Hey Jess, how's it going?

01:56.142 --> 01:57.761
- Hey.

01:57.761 --> 01:58.594
- [Mike] Hey Andy.

01:58.594 --> 02:00.501
- What's up Mike?

02:00.501 --> 02:02.476
(students chuckling)

02:02.476 --> 02:04.745
- Look, Andy, you guys,
come on, let's get together.

02:04.745 --> 02:05.578
- [Mike] Get together everyone!

02:05.578 --> 02:06.776
Come on, let's take a picture.
- For the yearbook.

02:06.776 --> 02:07.609
- Okay.
- Come on.

02:07.609 --> 02:08.442
- [Mike] For the yearbook guys.

02:08.442 --> 02:10.514
- I don't wanna do this.
- Come on!

02:10.514 --> 02:13.345
- [Mike] You don't wanna
take a picture with me?

02:13.345 --> 02:16.428
(girls laughing)

02:16.428 --> 02:18.249
- Okay, so I'll come over around five.

02:18.249 --> 02:19.885
- Hey Andy, Andy!

02:19.885 --> 02:22.146
Will you give Lizzy a ride
home, I've got practice.

02:22.146 --> 02:23.979
- Okay, sure, I guess.

02:25.426 --> 02:26.416
Oh Jesus.

02:26.416 --> 02:27.322
That's so gross.

02:27.322 --> 02:28.405
Like go home.

02:29.573 --> 02:32.626
What did you assholes do to my truck!

02:32.626 --> 02:34.305
- [Lizzy] Oh my God!
(boys laughing)

02:34.305 --> 02:35.502
- [Andi] Oh my God Kevin!

02:35.502 --> 02:36.707
- Hey, it wasn't that great of a truck!

02:36.707 --> 02:37.781
- Michael White!
- Seriously?

02:37.781 --> 02:38.614
- [Michael] Miguel did it, all right.

02:38.614 --> 02:39.447
I didn't do nothing.

02:39.447 --> 02:40.687
- [Woman] Not Miguel, you get back here.

02:40.687 --> 02:41.520
Get back!

02:42.544 --> 02:45.294
(bells jingling)

02:46.502 --> 02:49.463
- Honey?
(ominous music)

02:49.463 --> 02:50.296
Tom.

02:52.397 --> 02:54.331
Are you awake?

02:54.331 --> 02:55.164
Tom.

02:58.619 --> 03:01.656
(Tom grunts)

03:01.656 --> 03:02.909
- What happened?

03:02.909 --> 03:03.915
What happened?

03:03.915 --> 03:05.582
- What's wrong baby?

03:06.510 --> 03:07.843
Are you hurting?

03:10.574 --> 03:11.907
Is it your head?

03:14.664 --> 03:17.247
(floor creaks)

03:19.467 --> 03:20.300
- [Mike] Check it out.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.325
Kevin, what you think?

03:21.325 --> 03:22.506
- [Kevin] Rhythm destination.

03:22.506 --> 03:23.934
- [Mike] I'm gonna beat you at the--

03:23.934 --> 03:25.755
- Cool, you found him.

03:25.755 --> 03:27.264
Mike, you know what, you're not getting

03:27.264 --> 03:29.173
in my car smelling like that.

03:29.173 --> 03:30.331
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:30.331 --> 03:31.184
You didn't tell her?

03:31.184 --> 03:32.017
- No.

03:32.017 --> 03:33.776
- My new alter ego, it's Miguel.

03:33.776 --> 03:35.882
- Hey Jess, your Mom wants you.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.342
Hey, miss me?
- Hey baby, of course.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.546
- I'll be right back guys.

03:38.546 --> 03:40.834
- [Kevin] Lovebirds.

03:40.834 --> 03:41.667
Shotgun.

03:42.582 --> 03:43.665
- What?
- No.

03:49.523 --> 03:50.535
- [Jess] What's up?

03:50.535 --> 03:51.563
- I have to take your father all the

03:51.563 --> 03:53.819
way to Ann Arbor to see the doctor today.

03:53.819 --> 03:54.939
- I know.

03:54.939 --> 03:56.541
You told me 10 times.

03:56.541 --> 03:59.637
- The repairman is coming at
four, I need you to let him in.

03:59.637 --> 04:00.470
- No, I can't.

04:00.470 --> 04:01.553
I have plans.

04:02.822 --> 04:03.905
- Don't move!

04:05.518 --> 04:06.550
This is Jennifer.

04:06.550 --> 04:07.945
No, I can't do that right now.

04:07.945 --> 04:10.514
Jess, lose the attitude.

04:10.514 --> 04:12.514
- What are you talking about?

04:12.514 --> 04:14.885
- I know you're all wrapped
up in this ghost trip, okay.

04:14.885 --> 04:16.577
But this is a really
difficult day for your Father.

04:16.577 --> 04:18.702
- Yeah, you won't let me forget!

04:18.702 --> 04:19.625
- [Jennifer] We all need to pitch in.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.293
- Then pitch in Mom!

04:23.109 --> 04:24.812
- Okay, you're gonna be here at four.

04:24.812 --> 04:25.645
- Whatever.

04:25.645 --> 04:27.462
- Listen, normal seniors
take trips to Cancun

04:27.462 --> 04:28.627
or Florida or something!

04:28.627 --> 04:31.914
- Since when am I a normal senior, Mom?

04:31.914 --> 04:32.831
Since when?

04:33.705 --> 04:35.387
Okay then, good talk.

04:35.387 --> 04:36.220
- [Lauren] Hey!

04:36.220 --> 04:37.498
- [Jess] What are you doing here?

04:37.498 --> 04:39.291
- Good to see you too?

04:39.291 --> 04:42.197
- [Jess] I gotta go, I'm late for school.

04:42.197 --> 04:44.197
- What's wrong with her?

04:46.069 --> 04:47.600
- Teenagers.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.610
- Right.

04:48.610 --> 04:49.714
- [Jennifer] When'd you get in?

04:49.714 --> 04:51.795
- Late, I just, I didn't
wanna wake anyone up.

04:51.795 --> 04:53.000
- [Jennifer] Have you seen your Dad?

04:53.000 --> 04:53.833
- No.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.870
Hey!

04:58.870 --> 05:00.633
- Lauren, what are you doing here?

05:00.633 --> 05:01.711
- I missed you?

05:01.711 --> 05:02.544
- Ah!

05:03.630 --> 05:04.554
Good to see ya sweetie--

05:04.554 --> 05:05.537
- You look good Dad!

05:05.537 --> 05:07.718
- You look great too!
- Hey!

05:07.718 --> 05:08.867
- [Dad] Oh, trouble.

05:08.867 --> 05:09.700
- Yeah.

05:12.639 --> 05:13.472
Good luck old man.

05:13.472 --> 05:14.305
- Thank you.

05:14.305 --> 05:16.162
- We don't have a handshake?

05:16.162 --> 05:17.635
- Oh hey, hey, hey!
- We have our own handshake--

05:17.635 --> 05:19.563
- [Jess] Can I still use the truck?

05:19.563 --> 05:20.877
- It's okay with me.

05:20.877 --> 05:22.231
- [Jess] Yeah.

05:22.231 --> 05:24.559
- I'm sorry, she gets to use the truck?

05:24.559 --> 05:25.392
- Yeah.

05:26.639 --> 05:28.520
For a ghost expedition.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.770
With her friends.

05:30.770 --> 05:32.900
- I never got to use the truck.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.844
- Curse of being the oldest.

05:34.844 --> 05:35.677
- Right.

05:41.982 --> 05:43.605
- Always working, huh?

05:43.605 --> 05:46.835
- One of us has to make an income.

05:46.835 --> 05:48.781
Don't do this, not now.

05:48.781 --> 05:49.956
- Don't do what?

05:49.956 --> 05:51.206
- You promised.

05:52.317 --> 05:55.791
You promised you were gonna
be supportive of my business.

05:55.791 --> 05:57.828
With the medical bills,

05:57.828 --> 06:00.950
Jess graduating, Lauren in college?

06:00.950 --> 06:04.867
Look, my company's our
only lifeline right now.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.645
- You know, you don't know what
I'm going through right now!

06:08.645 --> 06:09.724
Okay, you don't know!

06:09.724 --> 06:11.051
You weren't there!

06:11.051 --> 06:12.362
I should be dead!

06:12.362 --> 06:13.593
- [Jennifer] Don't say that!

06:13.593 --> 06:15.010
- You don't know!

06:16.807 --> 06:17.710
Who's texting you?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.359
The phone just keeps going and going!

06:19.359 --> 06:20.463
- They're going to hear us, stop it!

06:20.463 --> 06:21.296
- [Tom] Okay, let me see the phone!

06:21.296 --> 06:22.129
- No!

06:22.129 --> 06:22.962
- [Tom] Give me the phone!

06:22.962 --> 06:23.795
- Stop it!

06:23.795 --> 06:24.860
- Give me the damn phone!

06:24.860 --> 06:26.527
- You're scaring me.

06:27.901 --> 06:29.818
What's gotten into you?

06:34.651 --> 06:36.423
- I don't know.

06:36.423 --> 06:37.256
I don't know what's
- Come here.

06:37.256 --> 06:39.173
- [Tom] gotten into me.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.436
I'm sorry.

06:44.436 --> 06:45.269
I'm sorry.

06:46.250 --> 06:49.226
- It's okay, it's okay to be scared.

06:49.226 --> 06:52.173
You shouldn't be going through this.

06:52.173 --> 06:54.278
- There's so much pain.

06:54.278 --> 06:57.695
You're the only person I can let go with.

06:59.876 --> 07:02.543
(door knocking)

07:04.399 --> 07:05.232
- Hey.

07:07.340 --> 07:09.401
Jennifer, Tom, good to see ya.

07:09.401 --> 07:10.651
- Hello Doctor.

07:14.640 --> 07:15.723
- So, Thomas,

07:18.026 --> 07:19.781
how ya feeling?

07:19.781 --> 07:21.311
- Hanging in there.

07:21.311 --> 07:25.311
- Look, I'm not gonna lie
to ya, I am concerned.

07:26.685 --> 07:30.268
But we are going to
get through this, okay.

07:31.906 --> 07:32.873
Tom, let me ask you.

07:32.873 --> 07:35.526
Have you been having any

07:35.526 --> 07:38.276
shortness of breath, mood swings?

07:41.063 --> 07:44.146
- You think that's due to the injury?

07:45.351 --> 07:47.079
- Yeah, I think so, maybe.

07:47.079 --> 07:47.912
Maybe.

07:47.912 --> 07:49.829
We got your tests back.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.105
- Hey Mr. Mandl.

07:53.105 --> 07:54.780
We have a question.

07:54.780 --> 07:56.491
- Yes, what's that?

07:56.491 --> 07:58.770
- We've been doing a lot
of research on those myths

07:58.770 --> 08:01.343
for our trip, but we can't seem to find

08:01.343 --> 08:03.776
anything on those old
Indian burial grounds.

08:03.776 --> 08:05.433
- Oh yes, that's gonna be hard to find,

08:05.433 --> 08:07.683
and, well, for good reason.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.345
- I mean, all I found was a general map,

08:10.345 --> 08:14.428
but it doesn't even pinpoint
the actual location.

08:16.215 --> 08:19.665
- If you can look right in here.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.641
Now, this is your spinal cord

08:22.641 --> 08:25.618
and here is the soft tissue mass

08:25.618 --> 08:29.645
that is jammed in there
behind the spinal cord.

08:29.645 --> 08:32.977
And here is a major artery on top of it.

08:34.158 --> 08:36.784
Now, at least I think
that's what I'm seeing.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.994
But, I need to make sure, okay.

08:39.994 --> 08:42.764
So I wanna send you downstairs for an MRA

08:42.764 --> 08:44.822
and some further blood tests.

08:44.822 --> 08:45.655
- When?

08:46.850 --> 08:48.359
- [Doctor] Right now,
if it's at all possible.

08:48.359 --> 08:50.258
- All due respect Doc, this is--

08:50.258 --> 08:51.175
- Tom, Tom!

08:52.706 --> 08:57.363
Look, I need to know what
the problem is, okay.

08:57.363 --> 09:01.751
Now, quite possibly, we
may not even need surgery.

09:01.751 --> 09:02.584
- But why?

09:02.584 --> 09:05.626
I mean, wouldn't surgery help him?

09:05.626 --> 09:08.202
- Maybe and maybe not.

09:08.202 --> 09:09.649
I mean, right now, from what I know,

09:09.649 --> 09:12.421
it's about a 50/50 chance.

09:12.421 --> 09:16.671
And even if it were a
100% successful surgery,

09:18.032 --> 09:21.784
it would take nine to
12 months to heal, so.

09:21.784 --> 09:25.394
- What would surgery potentially do?

09:25.394 --> 09:27.232
- Decompress the spinal cord.

09:27.232 --> 09:30.084
It would free up the major artery.

09:30.084 --> 09:30.917
But,

09:32.146 --> 09:36.037
look, it's a very delicate,
difficult procedure.

09:36.037 --> 09:38.262
And frankly, I would not recommend it

09:38.262 --> 09:40.840
unless it were absolutely necessary.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.673
- Anything

09:42.679 --> 09:44.860
you can give me to deal with the pain?

09:44.860 --> 09:49.860
- Just take the pain medication
that's been prescribed.

09:49.909 --> 09:51.039
Take it easy.

09:51.039 --> 09:52.789
Do not push yourself!

09:53.844 --> 09:55.511
Oh, and, no driving.

09:56.669 --> 09:57.745
Jennifer, okay?

09:57.745 --> 09:58.828
- [Jennifer] Yes, yes.

09:58.828 --> 10:00.991
- Okay, all right.

10:00.991 --> 10:03.353
- Doc, you're asking the impossible.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.190
My entire life I've been told
to push through the pain,

10:05.190 --> 10:08.925
and now you're asking to
just stop when I feel it.

10:08.925 --> 10:11.675
- Look, Tom, the prognosis of you

10:13.577 --> 10:15.577
pushing through the pain

10:16.863 --> 10:18.113
could be fatal.

10:19.550 --> 10:21.495
You understand what I'm saying to you?

10:21.495 --> 10:23.828
It could cost you your life.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.160
Okay?

10:29.410 --> 10:31.993
So you have new parameters now.

10:36.341 --> 10:37.174
Okay.

10:38.215 --> 10:39.965
All right kids, look,

10:41.599 --> 10:43.725
it's not gonna be easy, but,

10:43.725 --> 10:47.516
like I said, we're gonna get through this.

10:47.516 --> 10:48.349
Okay?

10:49.543 --> 10:50.759
Okay.

10:50.759 --> 10:53.647
Kim will be in in a minute
to take you downstairs.

10:53.647 --> 10:54.480
- Thank you Doctor.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.230
- [Doctor] Okay kid, see ya soon.

11:03.187 --> 11:04.937
- It's gonna be okay.

11:08.379 --> 11:10.406
- Okay, I have a one of a kind ancient map

11:10.406 --> 11:11.853
that will get you to where you wanna be.

11:11.853 --> 11:12.896
It's very old,

11:12.896 --> 11:14.729
so be careful with it.

11:17.039 --> 11:18.622
- Thanks.
- Careful.

11:22.422 --> 11:23.526
- [Andi] Oh my gosh.

11:23.526 --> 11:25.220
This isn't far from our campground.

11:25.220 --> 11:26.470
See here, look.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.857
- [Kevin] Hey, what burial ground?

11:30.857 --> 11:32.738
I thought we were going camping?

11:32.738 --> 11:35.238
- Kevin, we are going camping.

11:36.222 --> 11:37.590
See, right here.

11:37.590 --> 11:38.423
Near the river.

11:38.423 --> 11:40.061
- That is a sacred burial ground,

11:40.061 --> 11:41.768
protected by wolf spirits.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.994
Revered warriors are
actually buried there.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.804
Now, it's a good idea to
maintain some respect,

11:45.804 --> 11:47.191
so I think you guys should probably stick

11:47.191 --> 11:49.416
to the old haunted houses that you found.

11:49.416 --> 11:50.620
- But why?

11:50.620 --> 11:53.154
'Cause, I mean I read
bout the spirit wolves.

11:53.154 --> 11:55.604
- The myth originates in the late 1600s.

11:55.604 --> 11:57.887
Legend tells that witches
came over from Europe

11:57.887 --> 12:02.148
to avoid the most vicious
persecutions possible.

12:02.148 --> 12:04.303
See, when they arrived,
the spiritual warfare

12:04.303 --> 12:06.029
broke out between the witch coven

12:06.029 --> 12:07.867
and the Indians who
lived in that territory.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.555
The witches actually used shape-shifting

12:09.555 --> 12:11.721
in order to fool the Indian.

12:11.721 --> 12:12.581
- Shape-shifting.

12:12.581 --> 12:15.268
- [Mandl] And they cursed
one particular warrior.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.101
- Okay, so where?

12:16.101 --> 12:17.226
Here?

12:17.226 --> 12:18.423
- [Kevin] I hate to interrupt,

12:18.423 --> 12:19.720
but it's almost four o'clock.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.795
- What happened?

12:20.795 --> 12:22.588
What happened over here?
- The repairman?

12:22.588 --> 12:24.403
- [Jess] What are you, my babysitter?

12:24.403 --> 12:26.035
- [Mandl] The witch was very powerful

12:26.035 --> 12:30.214
and she actually cursed
herself in aeternum vive.

12:30.214 --> 12:31.237
- Awe geez.

12:31.237 --> 12:32.570
Hey, no!
- Kevin!

12:35.293 --> 12:37.210
- [Andi] Bye Mr. Mandl.

12:38.997 --> 12:43.997
(ominous music)
(bells jingling)

13:00.245 --> 13:01.078
(slow paced music)

13:01.078 --> 13:03.110
- I can't wait to leave tomorrow.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.583
Since Dad came back from the Middle East,

13:05.583 --> 13:07.583
it hasn't been the same.

13:10.941 --> 13:12.802
(door knocking)

13:12.802 --> 13:14.196
Yeah?

13:14.196 --> 13:15.446
Oh Jesus.
- Hey.

13:16.476 --> 13:18.476
- [Lauren] Pizza's here.

13:19.533 --> 13:22.164
So what is all this stuff?

13:22.164 --> 13:23.291
It's creepy.

13:23.291 --> 13:25.154
- It's nothing.

13:25.154 --> 13:26.438
- It's been a while.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.519
You have a boyfriend now or?

13:28.519 --> 13:30.193
- No.
(slow paced music)

13:30.193 --> 13:32.185
Who has time for that?

13:32.185 --> 13:33.498
- I'm sorry, I just thought--

13:33.498 --> 13:35.081
- Why are you home?

13:37.105 --> 13:39.105
- I'm worried about Dad.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.122
I already lost one parent.

13:45.671 --> 13:48.421
Not really ready to lose him too.

13:49.744 --> 13:52.077
And he's not getting better.

13:54.207 --> 13:55.624
- No, not really.

13:59.816 --> 14:01.491
- The doctors don't tell you anything?

14:01.491 --> 14:02.757
- No.

14:02.757 --> 14:04.757
It's all one big secret.

14:05.617 --> 14:07.217
Like some days he pretends he's okay,

14:07.217 --> 14:09.300
but I can tell, he isn't.

14:12.283 --> 14:13.116
- Yeah.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.017
He just seems so tired.

14:20.591 --> 14:23.758
I used to think he was indestructible.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.941
We were really close.

14:27.941 --> 14:28.774
- Yeah.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.770
He's just been gone for so long, you know.

14:35.945 --> 14:38.201
And Mom has been totally unbearable.

14:38.201 --> 14:39.449
- Why, what's wrong with Mom?

14:39.449 --> 14:42.208
- I don't know, she's just

14:42.208 --> 14:43.708
been acting weird.

14:45.114 --> 14:49.021
I just can't wait til
I'm out of here tomorrow.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.271
I so need this.

14:51.456 --> 14:52.895
- That's right.
- Yeah.

14:52.895 --> 14:55.266
- [Lauren] Yeah, your trip.

14:55.266 --> 14:56.683
Tell me about it.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.296
- You really wanna know?

15:00.296 --> 15:01.129
- Yeah.

15:02.993 --> 15:03.826
- Okay.

15:06.502 --> 15:07.335
Here.

15:09.154 --> 15:11.926
So we're gonna take the I-75

15:11.926 --> 15:14.375
and then a couple back roads that I found

15:14.375 --> 15:15.208
and oh!

15:17.617 --> 15:19.445
Mr. Mandl gave us this one today.

15:19.445 --> 15:20.278
- What's this one?

15:20.278 --> 15:22.981
- It's an old Indian burial ground.

15:22.981 --> 15:26.357
Some legend about a wolf spirit.

15:26.357 --> 15:28.238
It's pretty cool.
- It's pretty creepy.

15:28.238 --> 15:31.988
- [Jess] Yeah.
(floor creaks)

15:38.697 --> 15:41.364
(ominous music)

15:42.533 --> 15:44.848
(wolf screams)
(Jess screams)

15:44.848 --> 15:45.681
You jerk!

15:48.370 --> 15:49.620
(light music)

15:49.620 --> 15:50.663
- Come here, I got it.

15:50.663 --> 15:52.194
- Oh, thanks.

15:52.194 --> 15:53.027
- Sure.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.917
- [Kevin] All right, I got a full battery!

15:58.917 --> 16:00.074
We got a full day!

16:00.074 --> 16:00.907
Andi!

16:02.616 --> 16:06.033
- [Andi] Okay, senior trip, day one!

16:07.560 --> 16:10.994
- Okay, I think we're ready to go!

16:10.994 --> 16:12.571
- We're gonna die.
- Do these belong to anyone?

16:12.571 --> 16:14.710
- Oh, yeah, thanks Mrs. Martin.

16:14.710 --> 16:18.622
- So you guys are really
gonna go chase ghosts?

16:18.622 --> 16:19.846
- You can't chase them,

16:19.846 --> 16:22.233
but they might be chasing us!

16:22.233 --> 16:23.337
- No, not excited.

16:23.337 --> 16:24.612
- You can capture ghosts on that?

16:24.612 --> 16:28.422
- Well, we can capture
apparitions Mrs. Martin.

16:28.422 --> 16:29.255
Right Kevin?

16:29.255 --> 16:31.280
- Well, be careful.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.787
You know how Jess is super sensitive.

16:33.787 --> 16:35.436
- Awe!
- You big sissy!

16:35.436 --> 16:37.046
- [Jess] Stop!

16:37.046 --> 16:38.846
- Okay, group picture!

16:38.846 --> 16:40.332
Come on.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.215
- [Jess] Where's Dad and Lauren?

16:41.215 --> 16:44.730
- You know how the doctor
said he can't drive?

16:44.730 --> 16:46.131
So Lauren took him to the store.

16:46.131 --> 16:49.760
But don't worry, he'll be
here before you go, okay?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.234
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.

16:51.234 --> 16:52.373
- [Jennifer] Group
picture, come on, please.

16:52.373 --> 16:55.044
- No, Mom, seriously, we gotta go.

16:55.044 --> 16:55.926
- Come on Jess!

16:55.926 --> 16:56.759
Just huddle up!

16:56.759 --> 16:59.541
(everyone chattering)

16:59.541 --> 17:00.460
- Just one okay?

17:00.460 --> 17:01.520
- [Jennifer] Okay, you ready?

17:01.520 --> 17:02.353
Wait, wait, wait.

17:02.353 --> 17:03.538
Wait just a second.

17:03.538 --> 17:04.443
I'm not ready.

17:04.443 --> 17:07.523
- So you get landscape and portrait.

17:07.523 --> 17:09.992
- [Jennifer] Good, let's go!

17:09.992 --> 17:11.558
- That's not.

17:11.558 --> 17:13.058
- This is my good.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.949
- [Jennifer] Smile!

17:15.949 --> 17:17.094
- This is it guys!

17:17.094 --> 17:18.742
- Yay!

17:18.742 --> 17:19.909
Ghosts!

17:19.909 --> 17:20.742
- [Jennifer] Good!

17:20.742 --> 17:22.570
- Ghosts!
- Thank you!

17:22.570 --> 17:24.488
- [Kevin] Don't post
that on any social media.

17:24.488 --> 17:25.367
- Window!

17:25.367 --> 17:27.448
- Okay, be careful!
- Bye Mrs. Martin.

17:27.448 --> 17:28.479
- [Jennifer] Bye!

17:28.479 --> 17:29.896
- Bye Mom.
- Okay.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.528
- [Andi] It's really
awesome that your parents

17:35.528 --> 17:36.650
let you drive this Jess.

17:36.650 --> 17:37.527
- Yeah.

17:37.527 --> 17:39.002
- So when are you two gonna tell us

17:39.002 --> 17:40.244
what you two schemed up?

17:40.244 --> 17:41.283
- Hey, Lizzy!

17:41.283 --> 17:42.766
- [Lizzy] Where'd you get all this?

17:42.766 --> 17:45.433
- Oh, you know, books, internet.

17:46.845 --> 17:49.316
You know what a book
looks like, right Brandon?

17:49.316 --> 17:51.885
(Jess laughs)
- [Brandon] Yeah.

17:51.885 --> 17:53.279
- Yeah.

17:53.279 --> 17:54.809
- Yo, Miguel.

17:54.809 --> 17:56.564
Where are those brownies at, I'm starving?

17:56.564 --> 17:58.213
- Be patient.

17:58.213 --> 17:59.826
They're a special treat for later.

17:59.826 --> 18:01.279
- I got something we can snack on.

18:01.279 --> 18:04.067
- Thank goodness.
- Here you go Daddy.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.400
- [Jess] Me, me.

18:06.412 --> 18:10.048
- [Kevin] So, where does the car stop?

18:10.048 --> 18:13.377
- All right, so this first
place that we're going to,

18:13.377 --> 18:15.738
they say this kid went mentally ill,

18:15.738 --> 18:17.840
or was possessed by a demon of some sort

18:17.840 --> 18:20.969
after finding a skull that
was cursed by a witch.

18:20.969 --> 18:24.654
One day, after being trapped
in his bedroom for years,

18:24.654 --> 18:26.887
he busted out, slaughtered his parents,

18:26.887 --> 18:30.004
cutting off their legs, their arms,

18:30.004 --> 18:32.020
and decapitating them.

18:32.020 --> 18:35.767
And then stuffing all of the
bloody parts in a closet.

18:35.767 --> 18:36.960
- [Mike] Whoa.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.141
- But then, he fell to his death,

18:39.141 --> 18:42.808
plummeting, and landing
on that same sickle.

18:43.676 --> 18:47.343
The bodies weren't found
until months later.

18:48.244 --> 18:49.627
- Ugh.

18:49.627 --> 18:51.145
That must've smelled like some nasty--

18:51.145 --> 18:53.076
- Ew, I don't wanna think about it.

18:53.076 --> 18:56.304
- Strange occurrences of people falling,

18:56.304 --> 18:59.036
the smell of decomposing bodies,

18:59.036 --> 19:00.695
and the sound of a sickle
slicing through the air

19:00.695 --> 19:02.321
is all that's left.

19:02.321 --> 19:04.159
That's what they say anyway.

19:04.159 --> 19:05.576
- That was scary.

19:06.622 --> 19:08.455
- Yeah, I know, I try.

19:09.586 --> 19:11.708
- Can we put some music on?

19:11.708 --> 19:12.992
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

19:12.992 --> 19:14.659
- [Jess] Pick a jam.

20:21.364 --> 20:24.281
(friends laughing)

20:25.354 --> 20:28.104
- [Jess] This way out of the car.

20:33.038 --> 20:34.284
- Is this where we're staying?

20:34.284 --> 20:35.982
- Wait, we're staying here?

20:35.982 --> 20:36.899
- No silly.

20:51.957 --> 20:53.592
Hang on a minute guys.

20:53.592 --> 20:55.525
I'm gonna check something out.

20:55.525 --> 20:57.025
- Be careful Jess!

20:57.931 --> 20:59.089
- Okay, who put her in charge?

20:59.089 --> 21:00.609
- Easy.

21:00.609 --> 21:02.853
- Well I'm not waiting.

21:02.853 --> 21:03.770
C'mon Andi.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.397
(slow paced music)

21:28.858 --> 21:31.525
(door creaking)

21:34.787 --> 21:35.620
Open it.

21:38.142 --> 21:39.514
- [Andi] I don't think we should.

21:39.514 --> 21:42.223
- [Lizzy] It's just an old barn house.

21:42.223 --> 21:43.904
- [Andi] Well then you open it.

21:43.904 --> 21:47.515
- [Lizzy] What, are you
like--(Lizzy screams)

21:47.515 --> 21:49.098
I'm fine, I'm fine!

21:50.610 --> 21:53.307
- Guys, I think I just
saw something in there.

21:53.307 --> 21:57.557
- [Lizzy] Oh my!
(slow paced music)

22:19.286 --> 22:20.851
- Guys!

22:20.851 --> 22:22.518
Come check this out!

22:33.795 --> 22:36.823
I saw something move right up there.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.090
- What?

22:38.090 --> 22:39.845
Are you messing with us?

22:39.845 --> 22:40.905
- What?

22:40.905 --> 22:42.787
- The door, did you open it?

22:42.787 --> 22:43.908
- No.
- Yeah.

22:43.908 --> 22:45.114
- [Jess] I was looking at that.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.768
See?

22:46.768 --> 22:48.560
See, there it is.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.706
- [Mike] Oh, it's the mental kid!

22:51.706 --> 22:53.472
- Hey, it's not funny!

22:53.472 --> 22:54.648
- No, I think it's just the wind.

22:54.648 --> 22:56.078
I mean, the back door wasn't even locked.

22:56.078 --> 22:56.948
This place is abandoned.

22:56.948 --> 22:59.750
- I'm telling you, I saw
something move in there.

22:59.750 --> 23:02.058
- I saw something move
inside in the back too.

23:02.058 --> 23:03.869
- [Lizzy] You guys.

23:03.869 --> 23:05.715
- Well what are we waiting for?

23:05.715 --> 23:08.382
Let's see if it's just the wind.

23:10.989 --> 23:14.113
- I don't think it's a good idea.

23:14.113 --> 23:15.823
- Well, there's a rational explanation

23:15.823 --> 23:16.916
for everything, right?

23:16.916 --> 23:18.299
(Mike scoffs)

23:18.299 --> 23:19.966
- I guess we'll see.

23:21.655 --> 23:24.905
If you guys find this tape, and not us,

23:26.322 --> 23:28.878
don't go in that house.

23:28.878 --> 23:30.342
For reals though, who touched that door?

23:30.342 --> 23:32.160
- Come on camera Kev, let's go!

23:32.160 --> 23:34.827
(door creaking)

23:41.836 --> 23:43.491
- [Andi] I don't think
this is a good idea guys.

23:43.491 --> 23:47.991
- Maybe whatever she saw is
trying to get out of this.

23:49.414 --> 23:50.247
Okay.

23:51.401 --> 23:53.255
I believe you now Jess.

23:53.255 --> 23:55.156
Somebody was definitely in here.

23:55.156 --> 23:58.889
They were trying to get the hell out.

23:58.889 --> 23:59.722
- Hello.

24:01.995 --> 24:04.229
- You really make me
feel like the black guy.

24:04.229 --> 24:06.089
Look at this!

24:06.089 --> 24:07.220
I don't wanna be here!

24:07.220 --> 24:08.952
You're a terrible best friend.

24:08.952 --> 24:10.217
- I didn't know.

24:10.217 --> 24:11.217
- Oh my God.

24:12.515 --> 24:14.163
- [Andi] Ew, the sink.

24:14.163 --> 24:15.413
- [Kevin] Okay.

24:20.462 --> 24:25.462
(ominous music)
(floor creaking)

24:26.984 --> 24:27.817
- Creepy.

24:32.084 --> 24:33.084
- Feel that?

24:34.068 --> 24:35.539
It's pretty cold right here.

24:35.539 --> 24:37.200
- Yeah, no duh.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.246
Cold everywhere.
- Yeah.

24:39.246 --> 24:40.579
- [Mike] No duh.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.483
(ominous music)

24:56.873 --> 24:58.540
- What's that smell?

24:59.417 --> 25:01.250
- [Mike] It wasn't me.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.709
- Mike, I think you're rotting dude.

25:04.709 --> 25:05.713
- I don't smell anything.

25:05.713 --> 25:08.554
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

25:08.554 --> 25:09.637
- Be careful.

25:15.177 --> 25:16.260
- This is it.

25:17.666 --> 25:19.506
This is the room where
he fell down the stairs

25:19.506 --> 25:22.481
and landed on the sickle, right here.

25:22.481 --> 25:23.809
Here.

25:23.809 --> 25:25.152
- Oh no.

25:25.152 --> 25:26.652
- [Brandon] Kevin!

25:28.688 --> 25:31.031
Yo, what are you doing in the closet?

25:31.031 --> 25:32.924
- Oh, I thought I was hearing.

25:32.924 --> 25:34.471
Hey man, I ain't in no closet.

25:34.471 --> 25:35.304
- [Brandon] Yeah you were.

25:35.304 --> 25:36.137
- What, do you wanna arm wrestle?

25:36.137 --> 25:38.387
No, you probably want a sword fight, huh?

25:38.387 --> 25:39.227
- You were in the closet.

25:39.227 --> 25:42.406
- No man.
- Kevin was in the closet.

25:42.406 --> 25:45.680
- [Mike] Yo Kev, don't on
those paranormal TV shows

25:45.680 --> 25:47.789
they try to talk to the ghosts?

25:47.789 --> 25:50.504
- Yeah, they ask them questions

25:50.504 --> 25:52.359
and collect EVP.

25:52.359 --> 25:54.269
- What's EVP?

25:54.269 --> 25:56.469
- Electronic voice phenomenon.

25:56.469 --> 25:59.146
When the paranormal voices get trapped

25:59.146 --> 26:02.021
in the background hisses
of the recording device.

26:02.021 --> 26:04.998
Don't ask me how I know that.

26:04.998 --> 26:05.831
- Hello?

26:07.163 --> 26:09.922
Is anybody there?
(ominous music)

26:09.922 --> 26:13.079
Yo Mike, ask them a question.

26:13.079 --> 26:14.746
- Y'all smoke trees?

26:16.879 --> 26:19.322
You guys like pot man?

26:19.322 --> 26:20.739
We come in peace.

26:21.731 --> 26:22.564
Hello?

26:23.955 --> 26:24.788
Nothing.

26:29.521 --> 26:30.938
- Hey Andi, Jess!

26:38.659 --> 26:41.299
Awe, I see the real
party's down here, huh?

26:41.299 --> 26:43.290
Got a whole 'nother video going on.

26:43.290 --> 26:45.978
Yeah, raise that shirt up.

26:45.978 --> 26:48.879
You guys on spring
break or something here.

26:48.879 --> 26:50.555
Get it, get it.

26:50.555 --> 26:51.388
Oh damn!

26:52.799 --> 26:53.968
Hey man, that's your girlfriend.

26:53.968 --> 26:56.051
That's a little too much.

26:57.677 --> 26:58.510
- Jess?

27:00.438 --> 27:01.271
Andi?

27:05.531 --> 27:09.005
(ominous music)

27:09.005 --> 27:11.505
(door clanks)

27:19.112 --> 27:20.863
(Mike screams)

27:20.863 --> 27:22.196
- You guys okay?

27:23.248 --> 27:24.396
- No!

27:24.396 --> 27:25.563
Don't do that!

27:28.727 --> 27:29.948
- This has gotta be the room

27:29.948 --> 27:32.925
where we saw the figure standing in.

27:32.925 --> 27:33.758
Look.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.914
Hair standing on my arm.

27:38.805 --> 27:40.218
- Look, I don't wanna be here anymore.

27:40.218 --> 27:41.295
Can we go?

27:41.295 --> 27:42.851
- No, wait, it's the master bedroom.

27:42.851 --> 27:44.831
It's where he did it.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.987
(door slams)
(everyone screaming)

27:46.987 --> 27:47.820
- Go go!

27:49.770 --> 27:51.617
- [Brandon] Yo, what's going on?

27:51.617 --> 27:54.741
Why are you screaming like a little girl?

27:54.741 --> 27:57.146
Yeah, I think they're
just messing with us.

27:57.146 --> 27:58.484
- Brandon!
- Shit!

27:58.484 --> 28:00.151
- Brandon!
- Come on!

28:05.445 --> 28:07.125
(door slams)

28:07.125 --> 28:08.151
- [Andi] Where's Lizzy and Brandon?

28:08.151 --> 28:09.108
- They're right here!

28:09.108 --> 28:10.889
- Let go of my hand, you ass!

28:10.889 --> 28:11.722
- Ass, bitch,

28:11.722 --> 28:13.279
I just saved your life!
- You almost broke my ankle!

28:13.279 --> 28:14.484
- [Lizzy] Don't call me a bitch.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.238
- Look, can we talk about
this in the car, please?

28:16.238 --> 28:17.520
I'm freaking man!
- Come on, let's go!

28:17.520 --> 28:18.669
- [Jess] Mike, wait, hey!

28:18.669 --> 28:20.586
What happened guys?

28:20.586 --> 28:21.419
- [Brandon] Something pushed us.

28:21.419 --> 28:22.586
- [Jess] Us too!

28:22.586 --> 28:23.818
- You know what, we should all take a hit,

28:23.818 --> 28:24.651
it calms the nerves.

28:24.651 --> 28:25.881
- [Everyone] Get in the car Mike!

28:25.881 --> 28:26.883
- [Brandon] Mike, get in the car!

28:26.883 --> 28:27.883
- All right!

28:30.654 --> 28:31.487
Go!

28:40.109 --> 28:41.490
What was that?

28:41.490 --> 28:43.401
- That was a waste of time.
- Guys, is everyone okay?

28:43.401 --> 28:44.321
- [Mike] Waste of time?

28:44.321 --> 28:45.662
What are you talking about?

28:45.662 --> 28:46.790
Didn't you get?

28:46.790 --> 28:47.996
I didn't touch anybody!
- Guys, calm down!

28:47.996 --> 28:49.224
- You saw us.
- Just calm down, okay?

28:49.224 --> 28:50.393
- [Kevin] You guys gotta see this.

28:50.393 --> 28:51.490
- I'm not calm, I didn't
even get to smoke.

28:51.490 --> 28:52.575
- Hey!
- What?

28:52.575 --> 28:53.408
- [Kevin] Pull over!

28:53.408 --> 28:54.241
Pull over!

28:54.241 --> 28:55.416
- Let's not pull over.
- What are you talking about?

28:55.416 --> 28:56.664
- Jess, just pull over the car!

28:56.664 --> 28:58.327
- All right, all right, I'm pulling over!

28:58.327 --> 28:59.343
- [Lizzy] We're in the middle of nowhere!

28:59.343 --> 29:01.596
- I'm pulling over!
(Lizzy scoffs)

29:01.596 --> 29:02.598
Calm down guys.

29:02.598 --> 29:04.681
- [Lizzy] Seriously Jess?

29:15.450 --> 29:16.283
- Look, right there.

29:16.283 --> 29:17.676
- Yeah, right there.

29:17.676 --> 29:20.353
Is this the ghost that stood behind Jess?

29:20.353 --> 29:21.674
Right here.

29:21.674 --> 29:22.741
- That's him.

29:22.741 --> 29:24.641
- Oh my god.
- Who is that?

29:24.641 --> 29:26.317
- [Andi] That's the kid
who killed his family.

29:26.317 --> 29:27.625
That was on the camera.
- The mental kid?

29:27.625 --> 29:28.804
- [Andi] I don't believe it.

29:28.804 --> 29:29.637
- What are you doing?

29:29.637 --> 29:31.294
You eating a freaking flower?

29:31.294 --> 29:33.001
- No, it's a dandelion.

29:33.001 --> 29:36.334
I read about it in one of
Jess's Native American books.

29:36.334 --> 29:37.363
- God Mike!

29:37.363 --> 29:38.512
- Good for you.

29:38.512 --> 29:39.898
I got the munchies!

29:39.898 --> 29:41.815
- [Jess] Let's go Mike.

29:45.645 --> 29:47.887
- So, where to next?

29:47.887 --> 29:51.304
- What's more exciting than the last one?

29:53.860 --> 29:56.110
Hey, can I see those notes?

29:57.045 --> 29:57.878
- Sure.

30:04.157 --> 30:05.578
- Okay, you guys, this
doesn't look any better

30:05.578 --> 30:08.708
than the one we were just on.

30:08.708 --> 30:10.727
How about the graveyard
from the late 1800s?

30:10.727 --> 30:11.874
- [Jess] No.

30:11.874 --> 30:13.893
Too far from here.

30:13.893 --> 30:14.726
- Okay.

30:16.571 --> 30:19.491
The forest with the burial ground?

30:19.491 --> 30:20.434
It says it's supposed to be one of

30:20.434 --> 30:22.934
the most haunted place around.

30:23.930 --> 30:25.536
- No, you know, I don't think you guys

30:25.536 --> 30:27.425
are ready for that yet.

30:27.425 --> 30:28.965
- Why are you two the only ones

30:28.965 --> 30:30.299
that get to decide where we go?

30:30.299 --> 30:31.132
- [Brandon] Easy.

30:31.132 --> 30:31.965
- No, I'm serious.

30:31.965 --> 30:32.798
Like right guys?

30:32.798 --> 30:33.631
It's not fair.

30:33.631 --> 30:34.697
- [Jess] You're right Lizzy.

30:34.697 --> 30:35.780
You're right.

30:36.759 --> 30:38.114
We could go to the burial ground.

30:38.114 --> 30:38.947
- [Andi] Jess, I thought we were--

30:38.947 --> 30:41.193
- [Jess] Andi, she's right.

30:41.193 --> 30:42.026
We have to go.

30:42.026 --> 30:43.300
- Thank you!

30:43.300 --> 30:44.850
Now we get to do something
we all want to do.

30:44.850 --> 30:46.433
- [Kevin] Hey Jess.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.069
- Okay, stay on this for another 15 miles.

30:51.069 --> 30:51.902
- Okay.

30:52.789 --> 30:54.869
- So, does anyone know what
we're actually supposed to do

30:54.869 --> 30:57.565
if we run into a ghost?

30:57.565 --> 31:00.741
- Apparently run and scream
like a little girl, right?

31:00.741 --> 31:01.744
- No, you know,
(Andi laughs)

31:01.744 --> 31:02.864
I read that you're actually supposed

31:02.864 --> 31:04.233
to make the sign of the cross

31:04.233 --> 31:07.516
and then you ask the
spirit if you can help.

31:07.516 --> 31:09.308
- Guys, I'd really hate to interrupt

31:09.308 --> 31:10.746
this little prayer session
that we have going on,

31:10.746 --> 31:13.046
but we have got to stop for food.

31:13.046 --> 31:14.357
I am starving.

31:14.357 --> 31:17.642
- Dude, you just ate like
a pound of bacon and eggs.

31:17.642 --> 31:18.475
Are you serious?

31:18.475 --> 31:20.165
- Yeah, and a protein shake.

31:20.165 --> 31:22.255
- Okay, that is literally all you do.

31:22.255 --> 31:25.005
- Well, I have a fast metabolism.

31:26.663 --> 31:28.663
- [Lizzy] I have to pee!

31:35.397 --> 31:39.009
- This looks like a pretty cool place.

31:39.009 --> 31:40.842
I'm starving you guys.

31:41.704 --> 31:44.768
- What are you talking about Kev?

31:44.768 --> 31:47.944
- So where are you kids headed?

31:47.944 --> 31:49.783
- Haunted forest.

31:49.783 --> 31:50.616
Know it?

31:51.472 --> 31:52.704
- Yeah, there's a lot of myths up here.

31:52.704 --> 31:54.578
What forest you looking for?

31:54.578 --> 31:56.188
- Well have you ever heard of the

31:56.188 --> 31:58.350
burial grounds with the
witches and the wolves?

31:58.350 --> 31:59.499
- Yeah.

31:59.499 --> 32:00.638
- Yeah, it's a tourist attraction

32:00.638 --> 32:03.255
for wanna be ghost hunters.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.453
- Yeah, but is it like really haunted?

32:05.453 --> 32:06.466
- Oh sure.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.549
Ghosts, witches, bigfoot.

32:09.434 --> 32:11.543
- Oh wow!
- Bigfoot.

32:11.543 --> 32:12.675
- [Jess] That's funny.

32:12.675 --> 32:15.089
(Andi laughing)

32:15.089 --> 32:17.724
- They say they're not
just ghosts you know.

32:17.724 --> 32:19.523
They're demons.

32:19.523 --> 32:22.707
That old burial ground is
protected by wolf spirits.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.373
Anyone who disturbs their rest

32:24.373 --> 32:26.174
will have a rest themselves.

32:26.174 --> 32:27.591
- Excuse me Stan.

32:29.421 --> 32:31.390
- [Jess] Thank you.

32:31.390 --> 32:32.223
- Hey.

32:33.487 --> 32:35.397
Still haven't heard from her?

32:35.397 --> 32:37.035
- No.
- No.

32:37.035 --> 32:38.690
- [Jennifer] We're going crazy.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.544
- I'm sure she's fine.

32:40.544 --> 32:42.238
I'll check on her on
my way back to school.

32:42.238 --> 32:43.812
- You know where she is?

32:43.812 --> 32:44.723
- [Tom] Where?

32:44.723 --> 32:45.783
- Yeah, you don't?

32:45.783 --> 32:48.554
- No, she doesn't tell us shit anymore.

32:48.554 --> 32:50.173
- Sorry.

32:50.173 --> 32:52.886
(Kevin speaks too low)

32:52.886 --> 32:54.345
- So it's a wolf-like demon

32:54.345 --> 32:55.564
that runs the heart of the forest,

32:55.564 --> 32:57.393
attacking anyone who crosses the fence.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.557
The first one to jump the fence

32:59.557 --> 33:01.474
is the last one to die.

33:02.435 --> 33:06.097
They say that demon drove
'ol John Baxter crazy.

33:06.097 --> 33:08.378
Hung his family, set fire to the house,

33:08.378 --> 33:10.539
then killed himself.

33:10.539 --> 33:11.862
Never found his remains.

33:11.862 --> 33:13.319
You think I'm playing, huh?

33:13.319 --> 33:15.465
Never found his remains.

33:15.465 --> 33:16.836
- I read about that somewhere.

33:16.836 --> 33:20.097
- Yeah, could have
happened not that long ago.

33:20.097 --> 33:22.847
But this one don't read, does he?

33:24.006 --> 33:25.891
- [Jess] He doesn't take too kindly to it.

33:25.891 --> 33:27.012
- I read.

33:27.012 --> 33:29.679
- Do you think we can get a map?

33:30.857 --> 33:33.171
- I'll be right back.

33:33.171 --> 33:35.550
- Thank you.
- Jess, we don't need his map.

33:35.550 --> 33:37.706
- [Jess] What's wrong with another map?

33:37.706 --> 33:38.856
- Yo, I read.
- I just don't buy

33:38.856 --> 33:41.023
- [Jess] the part about...

33:43.121 --> 33:44.757
- There's a lot of abandoned
cabins around here.

33:44.757 --> 33:47.453
The owners were run off by the demon.

33:47.453 --> 33:49.870
Can't say you weren't warned.

33:51.389 --> 33:53.220
Two roads in,
(ominous music)

33:53.220 --> 33:54.104
you looking at me?

33:54.104 --> 33:56.271
Two roads in, no ways out.

33:57.672 --> 33:58.675
The route off the old fire road

33:58.675 --> 34:01.609
is rarely patrolled by the Rangers.

34:01.609 --> 34:05.751
Now this is on the house,
but you should go home.

34:05.751 --> 34:07.251
- So we eat first.

34:09.199 --> 34:11.476
(Lizzy giggles)

34:11.476 --> 34:13.308
- He was weird.

34:13.308 --> 34:15.225
- You guys are toasted.

34:17.252 --> 34:18.819
- What the kids asking you about?

34:18.819 --> 34:20.735
- About the burial ground.

34:20.735 --> 34:23.476
Tried to scare 'em off.

34:23.476 --> 34:25.331
- Sure you did Stanley.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.414
Sure you did.

34:30.947 --> 34:32.878
- All right look, I don't like this, okay?

34:32.878 --> 34:35.312
I want you to call me the
second you get there, all right.

34:35.312 --> 34:38.425
Better yet, write down the
address where you're going.

34:38.425 --> 34:39.257
- Yes sir.

34:39.257 --> 34:40.091
- [Tom] Lauren I mean it.

34:40.091 --> 34:41.050
I've already got one daughter missing,

34:41.050 --> 34:42.467
I don't need two.

34:44.156 --> 34:47.322
- Okay, two daughters missing, got it.

34:48.975 --> 34:50.391
- Following this.

34:51.291 --> 34:52.364
The store guys map
- You sure?

34:52.364 --> 34:53.676
- [Andi] said to keep following this road.

34:53.676 --> 34:54.509
Yes.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.643
Can I have the map please, thank you.

34:56.643 --> 34:57.476
Okay.

34:58.843 --> 35:00.885
- You said I'm fine?

35:00.885 --> 35:02.500
- Yeah.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.793
- So this is the right road, right?

35:03.793 --> 35:07.104
- Yeah, this is State Road I think.

35:07.104 --> 35:09.954
- Everything's a State Road.

35:09.954 --> 35:12.795
- Thank you Brandon, that
was very informative.

35:12.795 --> 35:14.875
- Oh Jess, whoa.

35:14.875 --> 35:17.408
You're not gonna believe this, but,

35:17.408 --> 35:20.137
we're literally like right
next to the burial ground.

35:20.137 --> 35:22.220
Look, we're coming up on.

35:39.980 --> 35:42.897
(slow paced music)

35:51.216 --> 35:53.296
- [Mike] Where are we?

35:53.296 --> 35:55.135
- [Jess] Come on, maybe we can stay here.

35:55.135 --> 35:56.700
- [Lizzy] Are you crazy?

35:56.700 --> 35:58.120
- Maybe I am.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.870
Brandon come with me.

36:00.944 --> 36:01.777
- Yeah.

36:04.971 --> 36:06.489
- That was some nice driving Jess.

36:06.489 --> 36:07.572
- Oh, thanks.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.479
- [Brandon] I wonder if somebody's home?

36:12.479 --> 36:13.646
- Looks empty.

36:15.412 --> 36:19.085
Hey, can you guys go check in the back?

36:19.085 --> 36:22.704
- [Brandon] Hey Mike,
how about a little help?

36:22.704 --> 36:24.166
- Hello!

36:24.166 --> 36:25.583
- [Brandon] Mike!

36:31.541 --> 36:33.046
- Will this help?

36:33.046 --> 36:35.976
- [Brandon] Give me that dumb shit.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.007
- Hey, it's locked back here.

36:37.007 --> 36:38.007
- It's okay.

36:42.469 --> 36:43.719
Lizzy, come on.

36:45.090 --> 36:47.840
- [Mike] Take your time princess.

36:59.234 --> 37:00.234
- Holy shit.

37:03.421 --> 37:04.254
- Dude.

37:08.967 --> 37:10.840
- What if somebody catches us Jess?

37:10.840 --> 37:11.673
- Yeah, we should--

37:11.673 --> 37:13.175
- Stop worrying so much.
- We should check the

37:13.175 --> 37:14.099
- [Jess] place out guys,

37:14.099 --> 37:15.529
before we go too crazy.

37:15.529 --> 37:17.203
Know what I mean?

37:17.203 --> 37:18.953
- Are those all real?

37:20.693 --> 37:22.465
- [Jess] That's a moose.

37:22.465 --> 37:23.851
- They forgot to save a spot for

37:23.851 --> 37:25.684
Jess, Andi, and Lizzy.

37:26.711 --> 37:27.869
(Lizzy chuckles)

37:27.869 --> 37:29.181
- That thing could eat you Kevin.

37:29.181 --> 37:31.730
- I'll go find a pillow.

37:31.730 --> 37:33.147
- They eat grass.

37:34.616 --> 37:37.533
(slow paced music)

37:40.821 --> 37:44.071
- [Kevin] Yo Mike, is anybody up there?

37:45.012 --> 37:47.502
- [Lizzy] We have this whole place!

37:47.502 --> 37:49.197
Awesome!
- It's kinda cool.

37:49.197 --> 37:50.138
- [Andi] What's with all these animals?

37:50.138 --> 37:51.555
- Yes, seriously.

37:52.807 --> 37:54.193
I mean.

37:54.193 --> 37:55.026
- [Andi] Right Jess?

37:55.026 --> 37:56.859
- Oh gosh, it's creeping me out.

37:58.569 --> 38:00.307
- It's weird but it's cool, kind of.

38:00.307 --> 38:02.045
- Seriously.

38:02.045 --> 38:04.688
Did you guys bring like
something to drink?

38:04.688 --> 38:05.521
- Oh gosh.

38:05.521 --> 38:07.089
Oh, we need that stuff.

38:07.089 --> 38:07.922
Hey guys!

38:09.063 --> 38:10.638
Why don't you put those
muscles to good use

38:10.638 --> 38:12.792
and go and grab our bags.

38:12.792 --> 38:13.661
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:13.661 --> 38:15.078
- [Lizzy] Please?

38:19.856 --> 38:20.689
- Okay.

38:22.590 --> 38:23.731
- Oh.

38:23.731 --> 38:25.102
- It's a hat.

38:25.102 --> 38:26.019
- Come men.

38:27.282 --> 38:29.877
We'll let the ladies clean,

38:29.877 --> 38:32.005
while we go use our muscles.

38:32.005 --> 38:35.505
- Ladies, prepare yourselves for magical--

38:36.585 --> 38:38.260
- Okay Mike, okay.

38:38.260 --> 38:41.101
(Jess screams)
- What's happening right now?

38:41.101 --> 38:43.344
- I hope you turned your smoke alarms off.

38:43.344 --> 38:47.459
'Cause it's about to get hot!
(swanky music)

38:47.459 --> 38:48.292
- Oh yes!

38:49.551 --> 38:52.242
(Jess and Andi laughing)

38:52.242 --> 38:53.776
- [Andi] He just messed up her hair.

38:53.776 --> 38:56.526
(men chattering)

38:57.932 --> 38:59.532
(Mike imitates sizzling)

38:59.532 --> 39:00.960
- Let's go get them things,
you know what I'm saying?

39:00.960 --> 39:01.960
Slap my ass.

39:03.423 --> 39:05.085
- Isn't Brandon beautiful?

39:05.085 --> 39:05.918
- Oh yeah.

39:09.141 --> 39:11.308
- Yo, we found a fire pit.

39:12.519 --> 39:13.793
- Did you just say fire pit?

39:13.793 --> 39:15.492
- [Kevin] Mm-hm.

39:15.492 --> 39:16.876
- 'Cause look what I have.

39:16.876 --> 39:17.793
- Oh sweet!

39:19.854 --> 39:20.937
Marshmallows.

39:23.422 --> 39:25.286
I don't do those.

39:25.286 --> 39:26.983
You know I don't smoke.

39:26.983 --> 39:30.066
Yeah, stop trying to get us to smoke.

39:37.556 --> 39:41.598
Do you really believe in
this paranormal stuff?

39:41.598 --> 39:43.581
- Oh, well yeah I do.

39:43.581 --> 39:45.081
I mean, don't you?

39:45.988 --> 39:47.255
- I didn't.

39:47.255 --> 39:52.255
I mean, but after today...
(slow paced music)

39:53.111 --> 39:56.489
- I don't know, I think it's fascinating.

39:56.489 --> 40:01.182
Trying to decipher what
exists and what doesn't.

40:01.182 --> 40:02.549
Dealing with the paranormal,

40:02.549 --> 40:04.632
a lot of it is spiritual.

40:05.588 --> 40:09.421
But it's science that
makes it real, you know?

40:11.234 --> 40:12.067
- Maybe.

40:13.337 --> 40:17.942
Really, if I wasn't there
I wouldn't believe it.

40:17.942 --> 40:18.775
- Well, to tell you the truth,

40:18.775 --> 40:21.323
I didn't think we'd find anything.

40:21.323 --> 40:23.154
I was hopeful.

40:23.154 --> 40:24.863
I'm really glad we did.

40:24.863 --> 40:27.485
Can't wait to see the
footage you captured.

40:27.485 --> 40:29.560
- Oh, I got some good stuff.
- Yeah?

40:29.560 --> 40:31.378
- [Kevin] I got some good shots.

40:31.378 --> 40:33.860
- Hey.
- What up, what up bro?

40:33.860 --> 40:36.627
- Nice fire.
- Impressive!

40:36.627 --> 40:38.308
- [Jess] Ooh, our city boys.

40:38.308 --> 40:40.027
- This guy right here.

40:40.027 --> 40:40.924
- I do what I do.

40:40.924 --> 40:42.527
- I taught you well.
- Here you go Jess.

40:42.527 --> 40:43.360
- [Mike] Let's get those snacks.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.355
- [Girls] Marshmallows!

40:44.355 --> 40:45.794
- Where's your chocolate Daddy?

40:45.794 --> 40:47.104
- Here, catch it Andi.

40:47.104 --> 40:50.490
- Go get them sticks.
- There you go guys.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.510
- [Mike] Here we go.

40:52.510 --> 40:53.343
There we go!

40:53.343 --> 40:54.676
- Oh!
- Catch it!

40:56.628 --> 40:58.202
- [Lizzy] I call the first one.

40:58.202 --> 40:59.999
Give me the bag.
- Deal, deal.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.264
- [Kevin] Sticks, sticks, sticks!

41:01.264 --> 41:02.097
- Oh yay!

41:03.106 --> 41:04.773
- [Lizzy] Thank you.

41:06.611 --> 41:08.374
- Kevin, where's my stick?

41:08.374 --> 41:10.025
- Here, the big one's Daddy's.

41:10.025 --> 41:12.780
(Kevin laughing)

41:12.780 --> 41:14.529
- Chocolate?

41:14.529 --> 41:16.466
Chocolate.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:16.466 --> 41:17.307
- [Kevin] Give me some marshmallows.

41:17.307 --> 41:18.810
- Marshmallows are a little busy.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.560
They're hogging them.

41:27.893 --> 41:29.929
- What's wrong?

41:29.929 --> 41:30.762
- Nothing, sorry.

43:47.457 --> 43:48.290
- [Lizzy] Women of the year.

43:48.290 --> 43:49.302

43:49.302 --> 43:50.593
What?

You don't like that?

43:51.799 --> 43:53.474
That was good.

43:53.474 --> 43:54.307

43:54.307 --> 43:55.510
- Good job guys.

43:55.510 --> 43:58.728
Yeah, gold stars.

Tom.

44:26.092 --> 44:28.035
Tom, are you awake?

44:28.035 --> 44:29.452
- Son of a bitch.

44:30.609 --> 44:31.442
Where's

44:32.289 --> 44:33.230
Jess.

44:33.230 --> 44:35.059
Have you called Jess?

44:35.059 --> 44:35.892
- No.

44:37.413 --> 44:40.244
- They couldn't run fast enough.

44:40.244 --> 44:41.674
- Who?
- The wolf was,

44:41.674 --> 44:43.757
- [Tom] came for her and
a wolf, a white wolf.

44:43.757 --> 44:45.221
Call Jess.

44:45.221 --> 44:46.899
You need to call Jess, call Jess.

44:46.899 --> 44:48.045

- Are you okay?

44:55.967 --> 44:56.800
Tom?

44:58.896 --> 45:01.846
- [Man] Jess, open the fire.

45:01.846 --> 45:03.542
(twig breaking)

45:03.542 --> 45:04.792
- Guys, listen.

45:05.659 --> 45:08.335
(wolf howling)
- Did you hear that?

45:08.335 --> 45:09.793
- I wish I didn't.
(ominous music)

45:09.793 --> 45:11.438
- What is that?

45:11.438 --> 45:12.771
- We'll be fine.

45:13.637 --> 45:15.387
- [Lizzy] What is it?

45:19.817 --> 45:21.501
(girls gasping)

45:21.501 --> 45:23.067
- Oh my gosh!
(light music)

45:23.067 --> 45:25.074
- Emerahgerd, it's a puppy dog!

45:25.074 --> 45:26.534
- It's so cute!
- Randi!

45:26.534 --> 45:28.037
- Her name's Randy!
- She's so soft!

45:28.037 --> 45:29.268
- [Kevin] You guys really
gonna touch that dog?

45:29.268 --> 45:30.101
- Yeah.
- Hi babe!

45:30.101 --> 45:31.134
- [Brandon] He has a collar.

45:31.134 --> 45:32.298
- But it's a stray.

45:32.298 --> 45:33.891
- Randy!
- Oh my gosh,

45:33.891 --> 45:35.980
- Her name's Randy!
- she's so soft!

45:35.980 --> 45:37.365
- [Jess] Hey look, you want a cracker?

45:37.365 --> 45:38.860
- [Lizzy] Don't give her crackers.

45:38.860 --> 45:39.693
- Why not?

45:39.693 --> 45:40.526
- Dogs don't eat crackers.

45:40.526 --> 45:42.126
- Ah, don't be silly!

45:42.126 --> 45:44.119
- Can we keep her?

45:44.119 --> 45:47.757
- [Jess] Nice girl, that's a good girl.

45:47.757 --> 45:48.590
- Hey pup!

45:48.590 --> 45:51.846
(Andi imitates kissing)

45:51.846 --> 45:53.013
You want more?

45:53.848 --> 45:54.987
- Mrs. Martin, did you
want to ride with us

45:54.987 --> 45:57.404
or follow us to the hospital?

45:59.051 --> 46:01.884
- I don't know where my girls are.

46:04.389 --> 46:05.581
- She's so cute.

46:05.581 --> 46:06.849
- I think I'm gonna go guys.

46:06.849 --> 46:08.071
- What?

46:08.071 --> 46:09.202
- Yeah.
- No, stay.

46:09.202 --> 46:10.732
- [Jess] No, I'm pretty beat.

46:10.732 --> 46:11.878
- Jess!
- Come on girl,

46:11.878 --> 46:12.958
- [Kevin] we're just getting started!

46:12.958 --> 46:15.384
- No, you guys keep toasting and roasting.

46:15.384 --> 46:16.217
It's okay.

46:17.140 --> 46:18.292
- Are you okay?
- Something's roasting man.

46:18.292 --> 46:19.321
- [Jess] Yeah.

46:19.321 --> 46:20.905
Isn't that what you're doing?

46:20.905 --> 46:21.738
Huh?

46:22.699 --> 46:24.070
- Well there's nothing you
can do for your husband.

46:24.070 --> 46:25.293
We have him stabilized.

46:25.293 --> 46:26.481
You go find your daughters

46:26.481 --> 46:29.163
and meet us back at the hospital, okay?

46:29.163 --> 46:30.330
- Okay.
- Okay.

46:35.862 --> 46:37.111
- [Brandon] I'll be right back.

46:37.111 --> 46:38.189
Hey, you want these?

46:38.189 --> 46:39.111
- [Lizzy] Where are you going?

46:39.111 --> 46:42.829
- [Brandon] I'm going
to the bathroom nosy.

46:42.829 --> 46:45.293
- And then there were three.

46:45.293 --> 46:46.543
- Jesus.
- Four.

46:47.871 --> 46:52.871
- [Kevin] I always forget
about you Mike, I'm sorry.

46:52.922 --> 46:55.672
(sirens wailing)

47:07.604 --> 47:08.854
- Go Randi, go!

47:12.538 --> 47:15.661
Let's get you some water, yeah?

47:15.661 --> 47:17.489
You want that?

47:17.489 --> 47:19.156
Ah, you'd like that.

47:26.103 --> 47:27.211
Hey.

47:27.211 --> 47:29.844
Why aren't you outside?

47:29.844 --> 47:32.619
- I just needed a break from Lizzy.

47:32.619 --> 47:34.869
- [Jess] What happened now?

47:36.258 --> 47:39.091
- She doesn't know what she wants.

47:41.030 --> 47:42.450
- Well she wants you.

47:42.450 --> 47:44.927
- Yeah, that's what she says.

47:44.927 --> 47:47.500
The way she treats me is confusing.

47:47.500 --> 47:50.926
I mean she's hot and then she's just,

47:50.926 --> 47:51.843
she's cold.

47:53.353 --> 47:54.770
- I can see that.

47:57.036 --> 47:59.022
Maybe you should just try and talk to her?

47:59.022 --> 48:01.105
- I tried talking to her.

48:02.343 --> 48:03.843
She just blows up.

48:06.607 --> 48:07.607
- It's okay.

48:09.815 --> 48:12.079
It'll work out, yeah.

48:12.079 --> 48:14.059
- [Lizzy] What's going on?

48:14.059 --> 48:15.182
- I'm just helping Jess with the pup.

48:15.182 --> 48:16.294
- No, I knew there was something

48:16.294 --> 48:17.225
going on between you two.

48:17.225 --> 48:18.149
- No, there isn't.
- Lizzy.

48:18.149 --> 48:20.556
- [Lizzy] No, I knew I couldn't trust you!

48:20.556 --> 48:22.496
No, no, I've been
thinking this for months!

48:22.496 --> 48:24.347
- Liz, you need to calm down!

48:24.347 --> 48:25.930
Okay.

48:25.930 --> 48:27.605
There is nothing going on, we're talking!

48:27.605 --> 48:29.035
We are friends, that's what friends do!

48:29.035 --> 48:29.868
- You're cheating on me!

48:29.868 --> 48:31.118
- [Brandon] No!

48:45.980 --> 48:48.705
- What was that all about?

48:48.705 --> 48:50.788
- Same old stuff I guess.

48:53.120 --> 48:55.120
- Yeah, but is she okay?

48:56.712 --> 48:57.712
- I hope so.

48:59.210 --> 49:00.043
- Hey.

49:02.711 --> 49:05.298
I've been meaning to tell you that

49:05.298 --> 49:07.446
I think this trip was a really good idea.

49:07.446 --> 49:10.161
(slow gentle music)

49:10.161 --> 49:12.578
I'm glad your Mom let you go.

49:13.729 --> 49:14.976
- It's my Dad.

49:14.976 --> 49:15.817
He convinced her.

49:15.817 --> 49:19.436
He told her it was like my walk about

49:19.436 --> 49:21.353
before I go to college.

49:23.598 --> 49:24.431
Sold.

49:25.887 --> 49:26.720
- You know, it's really great

49:26.720 --> 49:29.551
your parents are still together.

49:29.551 --> 49:32.376
You don't really see that much these days.

49:32.376 --> 49:33.709
- Yeah, I guess.

49:36.871 --> 49:38.454
Dad's gone so much,

49:40.513 --> 49:43.018
it's like they're not together.

49:43.018 --> 49:47.091
- Yeah, but at least he comes home right?

49:47.091 --> 49:47.924
- Yeah.

49:53.777 --> 49:57.944
- Did you see that crow
following us this morning?

50:00.075 --> 50:01.242
- Yeah, I did.

50:02.727 --> 50:03.727
You noticed?

50:07.098 --> 50:09.180
- Yeah, you know it has the ability

50:09.180 --> 50:13.013
to magically change into
whatever is required?

50:16.674 --> 50:17.507
- I did.

50:19.209 --> 50:21.292
Surprised you did though?

50:23.042 --> 50:25.709
- Well, they say the crows says,

50:26.697 --> 50:28.714
"My medicine gives you
courage to try new things

50:28.714 --> 50:31.675
"and not be afraid of the unknown."

50:31.675 --> 50:33.531
Kind of like this trip I guess.

50:33.531 --> 50:36.697
(Jess chuckles)

50:36.697 --> 50:38.447
- You know something.

50:40.976 --> 50:42.895
You're kinda cute

50:42.895 --> 50:45.121
when you're not high.

50:45.121 --> 50:45.954
- Yeah?

50:45.954 --> 50:46.787
- Yeah.

50:48.326 --> 50:49.326
- Goodnight.

51:03.824 --> 51:07.190
(slow gentle music)

51:07.190 --> 51:09.940
- Come on Lizzy, it's time to go!

51:11.876 --> 51:13.399
Rough night?

51:13.399 --> 51:14.816
- Leave me alone.

51:17.001 --> 51:19.584
- Well good morning to you too.

51:21.867 --> 51:23.277
(Lizzy screams)

51:23.277 --> 51:25.180
(Mike and Kevin laughing)

51:25.180 --> 51:26.013
- [Mike] Go, go, go!

51:26.013 --> 51:27.477

days, she's gonna get you.

51:54.947 --> 51:55.871
Hey, come here!

51:55.871 --> 51:56.704
Come on!

52:05.538 --> 52:06.371
- Lizzy.

52:17.442 --> 52:18.359
- You guys!

52:22.420 --> 52:27.420

(ominous music)

52:27.968 --> 52:29.351
- Here you go.

52:29.351 --> 52:30.218
- [Mandl] Hello Beth.

52:30.218 --> 52:32.099
- Hi.
- You're glowing this morning.

52:32.099 --> 52:33.222
- [Beth] Thank you.

52:33.222 --> 52:35.052
By the way, scruff looks good.

52:35.052 --> 52:36.119
It's cute.

52:36.119 --> 52:37.452
- Oh, thank you.

52:39.837 --> 52:41.718
- Robert, Robert, Robert.

52:41.718 --> 52:42.551
- [Robert] Good morning John.

52:42.551 --> 52:43.384
- Good morning.

52:43.384 --> 52:44.427
We still have that issue of those

52:44.427 --> 52:46.596
Indian artifacts to discuss.

52:46.596 --> 52:47.679
- Sure, yeah.

52:48.642 --> 52:49.847
- [John] You still have those eagle talons

52:49.847 --> 52:51.575
and those other items?

52:51.575 --> 52:52.658
- Yeah, I do.

52:53.801 --> 52:54.997
- They're illegal to possess

52:54.997 --> 52:57.781
and you can go to prison for that.

52:57.781 --> 53:00.314
- Well John, just give
me a couple of days.

53:00.314 --> 53:02.244
- Listen, you know I can't do that.

53:02.244 --> 53:04.205
I'm gonna be by later on this evening.

53:04.205 --> 53:07.219
- [Robert] I told you that I
would take care of it, okay.

53:07.219 --> 53:09.636
- Enjoy the rest of your day.

53:13.544 --> 53:14.377
- Anything else Robert?

53:14.377 --> 53:17.191
- [Robert] Oh, no thank you Beth.

53:17.191 --> 53:18.191
- Mr. Mandl?

53:20.043 --> 53:20.876
- Lauren!

53:20.876 --> 53:21.934
- [Lauren] Hi.

53:21.934 --> 53:23.288
- Hi, been a long time.

53:23.288 --> 53:25.958
- It has, funny seeing you up here.

53:25.958 --> 53:27.967
My little sister's in your class.

53:27.967 --> 53:29.132
- Yes.

53:29.132 --> 53:30.519
Eccentric young lady.

53:30.519 --> 53:31.811
- Hi, can I have a coffee please?

53:31.811 --> 53:33.079
In a to-go cup.

53:33.079 --> 53:34.020
Thank you.

53:34.020 --> 53:35.595
- So, hasn't your Father just returned

53:35.595 --> 53:36.890
from his tour in the Middle East?

53:36.890 --> 53:38.698
- [Lauren] Yeah, he's
been back for a while now.

53:38.698 --> 53:41.650
- You know, him and I had
the same MOS in the service.

53:41.650 --> 53:43.532
The exact same job description.

53:43.532 --> 53:44.365
- Really?

53:44.365 --> 53:45.459
So you're a Ranger too.

53:45.459 --> 53:46.870
- [Robert] Yes.

53:46.870 --> 53:48.506
So what brings you up here?

53:48.506 --> 53:49.993
- I'm, thank you.

53:49.993 --> 53:52.479
I'm actually looking for
Jessica and her friends.

53:52.479 --> 53:53.585
- [Robert] They're up here too?

53:53.585 --> 53:55.204
- Yeah, they're on some ghost trip?

53:55.204 --> 53:57.219
They're looking at
haunted places off a list

53:57.219 --> 53:59.337
that you gave them actually.

53:59.337 --> 54:00.519
- Oh, that was this weekend?

54:00.519 --> 54:02.692
- Yeah, I just can't find them.

54:02.692 --> 54:03.768
- You talking about that group of kids

54:03.768 --> 54:06.020
that came through here yesterday?

54:06.020 --> 54:07.098
- [Lauren] Probably.

54:07.098 --> 54:08.875
- Bunch of crazies if you ask me.

54:08.875 --> 54:11.493
I mean, who goes looking
for demons on purpose, huh?

54:11.493 --> 54:13.131
Not me.

54:13.131 --> 54:14.975
They wanted to know about
some Indian burial grounds.

54:14.975 --> 54:17.239
I told them, "Go home."

54:17.239 --> 54:18.906
Doubt they listened.

54:21.256 --> 54:23.319
- Lauren, if you'd like
to follow me to my place,

54:23.319 --> 54:26.210
I can actually help you look for 'em.

54:26.210 --> 54:27.564
- Sure.

54:27.564 --> 54:28.397
Yes.

54:31.601 --> 54:34.351
(girls laughing)

54:38.141 --> 54:38.974
- Hey.

54:40.450 --> 54:42.395
Did you see that?

54:42.395 --> 54:43.312
- See what?

54:45.020 --> 54:46.686
- I don't know.

54:46.686 --> 54:49.001
I saw something move over there.

54:49.001 --> 54:50.834
A shadow or something.

54:52.131 --> 54:53.398
- Bro, come on.

54:53.398 --> 54:54.836
- Come on, let's check it out.

54:54.836 --> 54:56.263
- I swear, I saw something.

54:56.263 --> 54:57.504
- Go on.

54:57.504 --> 54:59.421
- Come on.
- I saw something.

54:59.421 --> 55:02.004
(upbeat music)

55:03.974 --> 55:05.240
- [Andi] Hey, look!

55:05.240 --> 55:06.788
You guys, it's the hidden lake!

55:06.788 --> 55:08.830
- What? No way!

55:08.830 --> 55:09.663
No way!

55:14.168 --> 55:15.251
- [Andi] Yes!

55:20.004 --> 55:21.921
- [Jess] We so did it!

55:21.921 --> 55:22.754
We did it!

55:22.754 --> 55:24.469
We found it!
- Randi!

55:24.469 --> 55:25.302
- [Jess] Yay!

55:25.302 --> 55:26.934
- [Andi] Kevin, are you recording?

55:26.934 --> 55:28.945
- Dude!
- Like everything!

55:28.945 --> 55:31.580
(Jess laughing)

55:31.580 --> 55:32.830
- [Andi] Hello!

55:39.324 --> 55:40.157
- God.

55:40.157 --> 55:41.224
- Come on woman, we're losing them.

55:41.224 --> 55:43.285
- Stop yelling at me!

55:43.285 --> 55:44.698
I'm coming.

55:44.698 --> 55:46.128
- Shh, listen.

55:46.128 --> 55:48.397
- [Lizzy] Can't get this stupid boot.

55:48.397 --> 55:50.314
- Stop talking, listen.

55:52.126 --> 55:53.520
There's someone behind us.

55:53.520 --> 55:54.353
We gotta go, we gotta go!

55:54.353 --> 55:55.437
We gotta go!

55:55.437 --> 55:57.937
(tense music)

56:18.574 --> 56:20.047
Guys, guys!

56:20.047 --> 56:21.388
There's something back there!

56:21.388 --> 56:22.221
- [Mike] Where?

56:22.221 --> 56:23.054
- I don't know.

56:23.054 --> 56:25.540
It's big and it's moving fast.

56:25.540 --> 56:28.100
- Hey, did you guys see
that dude across the lake?

56:28.100 --> 56:29.724
- There's no one over there man.

56:29.724 --> 56:31.624
- Mike.
- You're high bro.

56:31.624 --> 56:32.457
- [Kevin] There's no one there.

56:32.457 --> 56:35.322
- I am not that high, yet.
- I don't think it's anything.

56:35.322 --> 56:37.614
- [Jess] Nothing to worry about.

56:37.614 --> 56:38.939
- [Lizzy] We should start running.

56:38.939 --> 56:41.884
- [Mike] Hey, you guys hungry?

56:41.884 --> 56:42.717
Because.

56:44.088 --> 56:45.682
- Yes, I'm starving, please.
- Wanna put your jacket down?

56:45.682 --> 56:47.210
- [Mike] I brought a special treat.

56:47.210 --> 56:48.210
- Okay.
- Oh!

56:49.717 --> 56:51.111
- [Andi] Is that all you brought?

56:51.111 --> 56:52.827
- That's all he needs.
- What'd you bring?

56:52.827 --> 56:55.165
- It's true.
- Oh hooray!

56:55.165 --> 56:56.739
- [Jess] Brownies, my favorite.

56:56.739 --> 56:58.557
- Just one?
- Are they fat-free?

56:58.557 --> 57:00.232
- [Mike] Yes.

57:00.232 --> 57:01.824
- Are they fat-free.

57:01.824 --> 57:04.407
- Thank you.
- Are they organic.

57:05.708 --> 57:08.295
- [Kevin] Oh, I got some size on mine.

57:08.295 --> 57:09.663
- Nah, nah.
- No.

57:09.663 --> 57:13.580
- Not happening.
- Sorry, it just, it just, no.

57:13.580 --> 57:14.835
(Kevin groans)

57:14.835 --> 57:16.365
- [Kevin] These are amazing!

57:16.365 --> 57:18.530
You my friend have been holding out.

57:18.530 --> 57:20.530
Now toss me another one.

57:21.452 --> 57:22.606
- Do you think this is the lake

57:22.606 --> 57:24.523
they threw the witches in?

57:24.523 --> 57:25.356
- What?

57:25.356 --> 57:26.439
What witches?

57:27.281 --> 57:30.540
- Oh 'cause, I read somewhere that

57:30.540 --> 57:32.858
in the late 1700s the way they were

57:32.858 --> 57:35.484
able to tell if women
were witches or not were.

57:35.484 --> 57:37.059
Well there were two ways.

57:37.059 --> 57:39.753
So one was either pricking
them all over their body

57:39.753 --> 57:41.077
to see if they were bleeding,

57:41.077 --> 57:46.077
or they would tie their hands
and feet behind their backs,

57:46.171 --> 57:48.524
throw them in the lake.

57:48.524 --> 57:49.941
- Like this lake?

57:51.076 --> 57:52.725
- They said if they
floated they were witches,

57:52.725 --> 57:55.437
but if they sank, they were not.

57:55.437 --> 57:58.767
- Basically, these women died.

57:58.767 --> 58:00.350
- I would think so.

58:02.213 --> 58:04.131
The witch that cursed the Indian,

58:04.131 --> 58:06.193
was supposedly beheaded.

58:06.193 --> 58:09.443
And they tied her up and they threw her

58:10.438 --> 58:11.521
in this lake.

58:13.786 --> 58:15.034
Yes.

58:15.034 --> 58:15.914
- Why are we here?

58:15.914 --> 58:17.097
- Ain't that something?

58:17.097 --> 58:17.930
- I don't know.

58:17.930 --> 58:18.763
I'm gonna listen to some music.

58:18.763 --> 58:19.921
I'm kind of freaked out.

58:19.921 --> 58:20.754
- Oh yeah.

58:21.750 --> 58:23.749
Partying with dead witches!
(upbeat music)

58:23.749 --> 58:25.416

(slow paced music)

59:00.213 --> 59:02.373

You guys wanna join us or?

01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:09.697
- Oh yeah, I guess so.

01:00:09.697 --> 01:00:11.530
- Okay, let's go then.

01:00:12.702 --> 01:00:14.694

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:15.797
Let's go.

01:00:15.797 --> 01:00:19.170

01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:20.003
- Hey!

01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:24.084
- Mike.

01:00:25.181 --> 01:00:27.188
What'd you put in these brownies man?

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:31.188
I feel real weird.
(funky music)

01:01:06.686 --> 01:01:09.269
(men laughing)

01:01:11.024 --> 01:01:12.705

01:01:12.705 --> 01:01:14.220
- [Kevin] Oh man.
(girls laughing)

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.137
You better.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:19.853
You won.

Where's my stick?

01:01:23.448 --> 01:01:25.098
- You guys.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.637
I don't feel good.

01:01:26.637 --> 01:01:28.137
- [Brandon] Lizzy.

01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.902
- What's wrong with Lizzy?

01:01:30.902 --> 01:01:31.735
- Hang on.

01:01:32.851 --> 01:01:34.877
Lizzy.
- Brownies?

01:01:34.877 --> 01:01:36.440
- [Jess] Mike, that was so not cool.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.607
- [Mike] What?

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.637
- Where'd she go?

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.103
- Brandon's gone too.

01:01:44.103 --> 01:01:45.840
- I mean, should we go get 'em?

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.397
- I think so.

01:01:47.397 --> 01:01:48.391
Let's go.

01:01:48.391 --> 01:01:49.930
- [Mike] I'm just gonna stay here.

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:51.051
- No.
- And close my eyes.

01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:53.067
- [Jess] No, no, no, it's getting late.

01:01:53.067 --> 01:01:57.009
We're not gonna be able to
find a place in the dark.

01:01:57.009 --> 01:01:58.300
- Hey Jess.
- You're right.

01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.133
- [Jess] What?

01:01:59.133 --> 01:01:59.966
- I've been looking at this.

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:02.172
I mean, the lake's not on here.

01:02:02.172 --> 01:02:03.005
- But--

01:02:03.005 --> 01:02:04.543
- [Mike] That's because
it's a hidden lake.

01:02:04.543 --> 01:02:05.852
(Mike laughing)
- God Mike!

01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:07.221
Pathetic man!

01:02:07.221 --> 01:02:08.957
- A hidden lake.
- You idiot.

01:02:08.957 --> 01:02:09.798
- [Kevin] Good one Miguel.

01:02:09.798 --> 01:02:11.631
- [Jess] Come on guys.

01:02:15.633 --> 01:02:18.550
(slow paced music)

01:02:28.367 --> 01:02:29.735
- Yo guys.

01:02:29.735 --> 01:02:32.104
How long have I been asleep?
(bird cawing)

01:02:32.104 --> 01:02:34.604
(tense music)

01:02:37.913 --> 01:02:38.746
Oh shit.

01:02:54.644 --> 01:02:57.394
(birds chirping)

01:02:59.213 --> 01:03:00.046
Hey guys?

01:03:04.505 --> 01:03:05.338
Guys?

01:03:21.806 --> 01:03:23.098
Guys, where are you!

01:03:23.098 --> 01:03:23.931
Oh my God!

01:03:23.931 --> 01:03:25.011
- Mike!
- Whoa, calm down!

01:03:25.011 --> 01:03:26.660
- [Kevin] Easy, easy bro.

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.493
We found Lizzy.

01:03:27.493 --> 01:03:28.353
- Yeah, sorry I freaked.

01:03:28.353 --> 01:03:29.690
Those brownies though.

01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:31.195
- No, it's Brandon!

01:03:31.195 --> 01:03:32.653
- Did you find him?
- Brandon, he's--

01:03:32.653 --> 01:03:34.088
- [Lizzy] He's probably
just still looking for me.

01:03:34.088 --> 01:03:34.921
- He's over there!

01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:35.754
- Is he coming?

01:03:35.754 --> 01:03:37.753
- No, he's hanging from the tree!

01:03:37.753 --> 01:03:38.586
- What!

01:03:39.952 --> 01:03:42.015
- [Mike] 'Cause he's dead man!

01:03:42.015 --> 01:03:42.999
- Stop playing!
- Mike.

01:03:42.999 --> 01:03:44.793
- [Mike] I'm not playing, I'm
not playing with you guys!

01:03:44.793 --> 01:03:45.942
- Chill!
- Is this another stupid joke?

01:03:45.942 --> 01:03:47.391
- No, it's not one of my jokes, okay!

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.108
- Whoa, let her go!
- You gotta believe me!

01:03:49.108 --> 01:03:50.449
- [Jess] Okay, show us!

01:03:50.449 --> 01:03:51.390
- Okay, please, let's go!
- Okay, yeah!

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:54.473
- I'll stay here until he comes back.

01:04:01.731 --> 01:04:03.064
- Just stop man.

01:04:04.118 --> 01:04:05.857
(Jess sighs)

01:04:05.857 --> 01:04:06.857
- Seriously?

01:04:08.327 --> 01:04:10.519
- Guys, I swear, he was right here!

01:04:10.519 --> 01:04:13.956
- Okay, regardless, we
have to find him, so.

01:04:13.956 --> 01:04:16.406
- He's probably just at
the lake by now with Andi.

01:04:16.406 --> 01:04:17.730
You're high.

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:18.833
I'm going back.

01:04:18.833 --> 01:04:20.777
You guys do what you want.

01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:21.610
- Bye.

01:04:27.668 --> 01:04:30.193
- You guys believe me, right?

01:04:30.193 --> 01:04:31.724
- Yeah man, we believe you.

01:04:31.724 --> 01:04:33.163
- Yeah.

01:04:33.163 --> 01:04:34.746
Sure.

01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:36.444
- Maybe it was a different tree.

01:04:36.444 --> 01:04:38.361
We gotta find the tree.

01:04:39.478 --> 01:04:40.908
- Or maybe an eagle grabbed him.

01:04:40.908 --> 01:04:43.241
- That's some big ass eagle.

01:04:50.748 --> 01:04:53.415
(ambient music)

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:56.243
- Andi?

01:04:59.953 --> 01:05:00.953
Is that you?

01:05:03.678 --> 01:05:06.345
(Lizzy screams)

01:05:07.632 --> 01:05:08.941
- Lizzy?

01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:09.774
Lizzy!

01:05:11.868 --> 01:05:12.747
- What happened?

01:05:12.747 --> 01:05:14.483
- Honey, what's wrong?

01:05:14.483 --> 01:05:15.316
What's wrong?

01:05:15.316 --> 01:05:16.149
- Andi.

01:05:16.149 --> 01:05:16.982
- Andi?

01:05:17.994 --> 01:05:19.938
- Someone's at the lake.

01:05:19.938 --> 01:05:20.895
She was over there.

01:05:20.895 --> 01:05:22.189
- Are you sure, 'cause that's pretty far?

01:05:22.189 --> 01:05:23.993
- Yes, she was right there.

01:05:23.993 --> 01:05:25.954
I saw something, I don't know.

01:05:25.954 --> 01:05:26.787
- What did you see?

01:05:26.787 --> 01:05:27.620
- I don't know, it was just--

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.453
- What?

01:05:28.453 --> 01:05:32.370
- It was just standing
there and staring at me.

01:05:33.432 --> 01:05:35.925
- I told you guys I saw
something at the lake.

01:05:35.925 --> 01:05:36.758
Remember?

01:05:36.758 --> 01:05:38.047
You didn't believe me.

01:05:38.047 --> 01:05:40.418
- So, the guy at the restaurant.

01:05:40.418 --> 01:05:41.724
He said they didn't patrol here,

01:05:41.724 --> 01:05:43.697
so either we just go back to the car

01:05:43.697 --> 01:05:44.974
and we'll find them, okay?

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:46.460
- Okay.
- We're gonna find them.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.727
- It's all good.
- Why?

01:05:47.727 --> 01:05:48.857
- [Mike] What good is it gonna do?

01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:51.364
Nobody's gonna believe us.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.210
Don't you see what's happening here?

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:54.122
- What?

01:05:54.122 --> 01:05:55.961
What's happening?

01:05:55.961 --> 01:05:58.128
- First Brandon, now Andi.

01:05:59.084 --> 01:06:00.573
It's the fence!
- What?

01:06:00.573 --> 01:06:01.771
- Brandon?
- Lizzy.

01:06:01.771 --> 01:06:02.893
- [Lizzy] What, Brandon's dead?

01:06:02.893 --> 01:06:04.277
- Yes!
- Lizzy, calm down.

01:06:04.277 --> 01:06:08.249
- I can't handle this!
- Lizzy, Lizzy, stop!

01:06:08.249 --> 01:06:09.499
- [Mike] Lizzy!

01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:14.288
You see it now?

01:06:14.288 --> 01:06:15.621
- Is that Randi?

01:06:16.976 --> 01:06:17.809
Or not.

01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:19.203
Let's go.

01:06:19.203 --> 01:06:21.068
- What about Andi and Lizzy!
(tense music)

01:06:21.068 --> 01:06:22.368
- [Jess] She has a map, she'll be fine!

01:06:22.368 --> 01:06:23.701
Let's go!
- Okay!

01:06:26.452 --> 01:06:28.469
(bells jingling)

01:06:28.469 --> 01:06:31.010
- [Man] Give me the stealth of the wolf,

01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:34.260
strength of the ox, teeth of the tiger,

01:06:35.222 --> 01:06:39.472
the jaws of the shark, the
eyes of cat in the dark,

01:06:41.629 --> 01:06:44.691
give me the claws of the bear,

01:06:44.691 --> 01:06:47.337
make me climb like a monkey,

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:48.754
I pine for blood.

01:06:52.496 --> 01:06:55.943
Give me the stealth of the wolf,

01:06:55.943 --> 01:06:57.526
strength of the ox,

01:06:59.026 --> 01:07:00.943
the teeth of the tiger.

01:07:02.857 --> 01:07:04.116
- Oh please tell me that's our cabin.

01:07:04.116 --> 01:07:05.091
Come on!

01:07:05.091 --> 01:07:06.841
Let's go, here it is!

01:07:09.397 --> 01:07:12.230
(tribal chanting)

01:07:16.148 --> 01:07:16.981
Hello!

01:07:18.553 --> 01:07:20.555
It's already open, come on.

01:07:20.555 --> 01:07:21.388
Help!

01:07:30.019 --> 01:07:31.269
- Find a phone.

01:07:32.462 --> 01:07:33.295
- I'll go look in the garage.

01:07:33.295 --> 01:07:35.744
- No, we have to stay together.

01:07:35.744 --> 01:07:38.072
- We gotta find a phone fast, okay.

01:07:38.072 --> 01:07:41.572
You guys keep looking, I'll be right back.

01:07:43.973 --> 01:07:46.640
(door creaking)

01:08:04.583 --> 01:08:06.000
- [Jess] Oh shit.

01:08:08.758 --> 01:08:10.251
- [Kevin] What the hell is going?

01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:11.237
- I don't know.

01:08:11.237 --> 01:08:12.176
We gotta get out of here.

01:08:12.176 --> 01:08:13.307
- Are they, are they dead?
- Get out.

01:08:13.307 --> 01:08:15.056
- [Jess] Get out.

01:08:15.056 --> 01:08:15.889
Oh my God.

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:19.287
What was that?

01:08:19.287 --> 01:08:21.526
- Found Andi and Lizzy.

01:08:21.526 --> 01:08:23.189
- Lauren, she--
- Lauren?

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:24.104
- [Jess] What about Lauren?

01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:25.064
- [Mike] She's, she's--

01:08:25.064 --> 01:08:25.897
- She's here?

01:08:25.897 --> 01:08:26.729
- [Mike] She's dead!

01:08:26.729 --> 01:08:27.563
- What are you talking?

01:08:27.563 --> 01:08:28.513
No, are you sure?

01:08:28.513 --> 01:08:29.345
- [Mike] Yeah.

01:08:29.345 --> 01:08:30.179
- I gotta go!

01:08:30.179 --> 01:08:31.011
- [Mike] No, just keep--

01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:33.228
- What are you doing?

01:08:33.228 --> 01:08:34.145
- Go, here!

01:08:38.193 --> 01:08:39.026
Okay.

01:08:39.026 --> 01:08:40.776
- Shh, shh, shh, shh!

01:08:42.944 --> 01:08:44.194
I have an idea.

01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:45.983
- [Kevin] Yo.

01:08:45.983 --> 01:08:46.816
- Shit!

01:08:49.624 --> 01:08:50.457
Come on.

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:11.014
- [Everyone] Surprise!

01:09:13.207 --> 01:09:14.383
- [Jess] Oh we so got you!

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:15.578
- [Lauren] Totally got you!

01:09:15.578 --> 01:09:17.341
- This is for the last
four years of torture

01:09:17.341 --> 01:09:19.104
you put us all through!

01:09:19.104 --> 01:09:20.720
- This was all fake?

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.938
- All right guys, so hey,

01:09:21.938 --> 01:09:23.586
how about a bonfire, huh?

01:09:23.586 --> 01:09:24.977
- [Mike] I like it, I like it.

01:09:24.977 --> 01:09:26.506
- Hi!

01:09:26.506 --> 01:09:27.712
- What are you doing here?

01:09:27.712 --> 01:09:31.121
- Mom and Dad were worried
so I came to check on you.

01:09:31.121 --> 01:09:32.459
Happy?

01:09:32.459 --> 01:09:33.292
- Yeah.

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:35.404
Mike scared the crap out of me

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.490
when he told me you were dead.

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:37.323
You suck!

01:09:37.323 --> 01:09:38.960
- I'm sorry.
- You suck.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.228
- [Lauren] I'm not dead though.

01:09:40.228 --> 01:09:41.095
- You suck.

01:09:41.095 --> 01:09:42.318
- I ran into Mr. Mandl at the diner

01:09:42.318 --> 01:09:44.072
and he said I should
get in on the prank, so.

01:09:44.072 --> 01:09:44.904
- Really?

01:09:44.904 --> 01:09:45.738
- Yeah.

01:09:45.738 --> 01:09:46.571
- Wow.

01:09:46.571 --> 01:09:48.145
- But I can't reach Mom and Dad.

01:09:48.145 --> 01:09:51.283
- I can't either, it's all dead.

01:09:51.283 --> 01:09:52.877
- Oh, we'll try after the bonfire.

01:09:52.877 --> 01:09:54.126
- Yeah.

01:09:54.126 --> 01:09:55.573
For sure.
- And you don't hate me?

01:09:55.573 --> 01:09:56.883
- [Jess] Of course I hate you.

01:09:56.883 --> 01:09:57.716
- What?

01:09:57.716 --> 01:09:58.884
(both laughing)

01:09:58.884 --> 01:10:00.089
- I'm kidding!

01:10:00.089 --> 01:10:02.449
- [Robert] You boys okay?
(Andi laughing)

01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:04.866
- My heart is still pounding.

01:10:06.311 --> 01:10:08.245
You guys really had us going man.

01:10:08.245 --> 01:10:11.188
- So you're telling me
this was all planned out?

01:10:11.188 --> 01:10:13.796
I mean, the ghosts, the demons,

01:10:13.796 --> 01:10:14.629
all of it?

01:10:14.629 --> 01:10:15.462
- Yup.
- Wait.

01:10:15.462 --> 01:10:16.781
- [Kevin] So none of this was real?

01:10:16.781 --> 01:10:18.580
- Nah, it was real.

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.302
Real as can be.

01:10:20.302 --> 01:10:21.702
- Well this house is actually in between

01:10:21.702 --> 01:10:24.400
the burial ground and
the other myth locations.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.832
I mean, I've been studying
this area for years

01:10:26.832 --> 01:10:28.037
and no ones ever seen anything

01:10:28.037 --> 01:10:29.348
from the side you guys came from.

01:10:29.348 --> 01:10:30.689
- Really?

01:10:30.689 --> 01:10:32.262
'Cause at one point I seriously

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:33.311
thought we were being chased

01:10:33.311 --> 01:10:36.311
by a pack of wild dogs or something.

01:10:39.407 --> 01:10:41.106
Guys!
(Lauren laughing)

01:10:41.106 --> 01:10:43.572
- Seriously, when I was at
the lake by myself you guys,

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:45.553
I saw something.

01:10:45.553 --> 01:10:47.220
It was like glowing.

01:10:48.573 --> 01:10:49.406
Almost.

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:52.774
- Yeah.

01:10:52.774 --> 01:10:53.913
I saw too.

01:10:53.913 --> 01:10:54.746
- [Lizzy] Me too.

01:10:54.746 --> 01:10:56.464
- So Mr. Mandl,

01:10:56.464 --> 01:10:59.026
will you tell us more of those myths?

01:10:59.026 --> 01:10:59.859
Please?

01:10:59.859 --> 01:11:01.047
- Yeah, come on, tell us!
- Yeah, please, come on!

01:11:01.047 --> 01:11:01.880
- [Jess] Story time!

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.904
- I think you guys have had enough.

01:11:03.904 --> 01:11:06.479
- [Girls] Come on, please!

01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:07.509
Tell us!

01:11:07.509 --> 01:11:09.092
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:11:10.676 --> 01:11:11.509
All right.

01:11:13.415 --> 01:11:15.165
All right, let's see.

01:11:17.632 --> 01:11:19.753
So it's been said,

01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:21.714
that there was a horrific

01:11:21.714 --> 01:11:24.367
spiritual battle between light and dark.

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:27.876
An absolute slaughter near the river.

01:11:27.876 --> 01:11:29.381
Now the warriors who fought in this battle

01:11:29.381 --> 01:11:32.128
were buried at this site.

01:11:32.128 --> 01:11:34.770
And they were given a
rare ceremonial burial

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:37.468
where they were appointed
wolf-like spirits

01:11:37.468 --> 01:11:40.327
to ensure that they would rest in peace.

01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:42.463
The leader of this battle

01:11:42.463 --> 01:11:44.688
was known as the protector.

01:11:44.688 --> 01:11:47.948
His spirit appears as a white wolf.

01:11:47.948 --> 01:11:50.198
- How did the battle start?

01:11:52.237 --> 01:11:53.070
- Witches

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:56.644
trespassing on Indian land.

01:11:56.644 --> 01:11:59.727
See, the witches would
shape-shift into wolves

01:11:59.727 --> 01:12:01.753
and try and fool the tribe.

01:12:01.753 --> 01:12:04.644
But the elders, they wouldn't
fall for their tricks,

01:12:04.644 --> 01:12:06.955
except for the chief's very own son.

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:10.667
The next in line to lead the tribe.

01:12:10.667 --> 01:12:14.640
See, the witches, they put a curse on him.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.962
Humiliating him.

01:12:15.962 --> 01:12:20.413
Causing disgrace between
him and his Father.

01:12:20.413 --> 01:12:23.111
So see, the evilest of all witches

01:12:23.111 --> 01:12:25.146
put a curse on the warrior

01:12:25.146 --> 01:12:28.211
so he would bring death and devastation

01:12:28.211 --> 01:12:29.743
to his very own tribe.

01:12:29.743 --> 01:12:33.723
Kevin, you know this from the other day.

01:12:33.723 --> 01:12:34.556
- So!

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:40.138
The elders told the warrior
that he was disgraced,

01:12:40.138 --> 01:12:42.365
and if he wanted to break the curse,

01:12:42.365 --> 01:12:46.240
he had to bring back
the head of the demon.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.073
They say,

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:50.200
spirit wolves protect it

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.323
so no one can disrupt the demon.

01:12:53.323 --> 01:12:56.481
So, anyone who removes the skull

01:12:56.481 --> 01:13:00.770
from it's burial ground will
be possessed by the demon.

01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:03.078
Obtaining all the witches powers,

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:05.277
driving any man crazy,

01:13:05.277 --> 01:13:07.944
ultimately leading to his death.

01:13:09.068 --> 01:13:12.740
- So what does the demon look like?

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.570
- It is said

01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:17.237
they have eyes that glow yellow.

01:13:19.276 --> 01:13:22.359
As a wolf-dog that takes shape as a man.

01:13:23.655 --> 01:13:26.155
(tense music)

01:13:29.059 --> 01:13:32.892
Wolves have the strongest
supernatural powers.

01:13:37.116 --> 01:13:39.533
- I think he's taking a leak.

01:13:41.848 --> 01:13:44.681
(rustling leaves)

01:13:45.693 --> 01:13:48.747
- [Robert] The hunt is usually settled

01:13:48.747 --> 01:13:51.327
in the first moment of staring between

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:52.994
a predator and prey.

01:13:56.165 --> 01:14:00.050
- He's got you guys.
- Now this encounter

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:04.242
- [Robert] is known as the
conversation with death.

01:14:04.242 --> 01:14:06.043
- I think I should head back
to school, it's getting late.

01:14:06.043 --> 01:14:07.531
- Oh no, stay.

01:14:07.531 --> 01:14:08.879
You can leave in the morning.

01:14:08.879 --> 01:14:09.876
- Are you sure?

01:14:09.876 --> 01:14:10.709
- Yeah.

01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:11.542
- With all your friends here?

01:14:11.542 --> 01:14:13.319
- Don't be crazy, come on.

01:14:13.319 --> 01:14:14.819
- Okay, I'll stay.

01:14:21.528 --> 01:14:24.111
- He's just trying to scare us.

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:30.532
- Yeah.

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.740
We're not falling for that again.

01:14:35.799 --> 01:14:36.799
Right Kevin?

01:14:39.439 --> 01:14:41.307
- All right, we'll be right back.

01:14:41.307 --> 01:14:43.390
- We're getting firewood.

01:14:44.308 --> 01:14:45.725
- Bowchickawowow!

01:14:46.578 --> 01:14:49.068
(rushing winds)
(Lizzy screams)

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:51.059
- [Woman] Somebody, what's going on?

01:14:51.059 --> 01:14:52.190
(rushing winds)

01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:53.023
What's going on?

01:14:53.023 --> 01:14:54.106
- Go!
- Hurry!

01:14:56.215 --> 01:14:57.212
- We gotta go, we gotta go!

01:14:57.212 --> 01:14:59.295
We gotta go, we gotta go!

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:06.120
I think it's gone.

01:15:07.013 --> 01:15:07.899
- Stay here.

01:15:07.899 --> 01:15:10.805
- You gotta go to the cabin okay?

01:15:10.805 --> 01:15:11.828
All right, you gotta go!

01:15:11.828 --> 01:15:12.856
You gotta go now okay!

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:13.854
Go!
(rushing winds)

01:15:13.854 --> 01:15:16.521
(Lizzy screams)

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.424
- Get inside!

01:15:19.424 --> 01:15:20.257
- Lizzy!

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:26.302
(window banging)

01:15:29.557 --> 01:15:34.075
(Lizzy screams)
(ominous music)

01:15:34.075 --> 01:15:39.075
(rushing winds)
(tense music)

01:15:39.316 --> 01:15:40.149
Lizzy!

01:15:50.405 --> 01:15:51.738
- Hey, you okay?

01:15:52.938 --> 01:15:54.473
Hey, young lady!

01:15:54.473 --> 01:15:55.306
Hey!

01:15:57.190 --> 01:15:59.190
You gotta be kidding me.

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:00.973
God.

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:06.334
- Officer! Officer!
- We need help!

01:16:06.334 --> 01:16:07.859
- [Officer] Hey, someone
tell me what's going on here!

01:16:07.859 --> 01:16:09.243
Someone tell me what's going on!

01:16:09.243 --> 01:16:10.374
- It caught him!
- Relax!

01:16:10.374 --> 01:16:11.207
- [Jess] It caught him, it caught him!

01:16:11.207 --> 01:16:12.140
- Listen, one at a time.

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:13.147
- You don't understand!

01:16:13.147 --> 01:16:14.333
It got Lizzy and Brandon!

01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:15.166
- What got Lizzy and Brandon?

01:16:15.166 --> 01:16:18.859
- We heard wolves howling and this thing!

01:16:18.859 --> 01:16:22.108
- This thing, it came out
of the woods so fast man.

01:16:22.108 --> 01:16:23.287
- Mandl's gone!

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:24.525
- What do you mean Mandl's gone?

01:16:24.525 --> 01:16:26.237
- I don't know.
- A wolf attacked him

01:16:26.237 --> 01:16:28.765
- [Kevin] or something.

01:16:28.765 --> 01:16:30.489
- All right listen, I want you
all back in that house now.

01:16:30.489 --> 01:16:31.322
Do you hear me?

01:16:31.322 --> 01:16:32.155
Move!

01:16:33.245 --> 01:16:34.873
- Mike, get in the house!

01:16:34.873 --> 01:16:36.790
Mike, get in the house.

01:16:43.552 --> 01:16:44.385
Over here!

01:16:46.823 --> 01:16:49.115
- [Kevin] What the hell was that?

01:16:49.115 --> 01:16:50.227
- What are we gonna do?

01:16:50.227 --> 01:16:51.689
- I don't know, I don't know!

01:16:51.689 --> 01:16:53.799
- I vote for leaving.

01:16:53.799 --> 01:16:55.799
- We need, we need weapons.
- Jess.

01:16:55.799 --> 01:16:57.337
- [Jess] We need something
to protect ourselves.

01:16:57.337 --> 01:16:58.870
- I saw a crossbow in the garage.

01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:59.703
- Can you go get it?

01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:00.721
- No, we need to get to the car,

01:17:00.721 --> 01:17:01.766
and we need to get out of here!

01:17:01.766 --> 01:17:03.281
- I'm not going anywhere
without protection.

01:17:03.281 --> 01:17:05.064
- Mike!
- Mike, Mike, no!

01:17:05.064 --> 01:17:06.196
- Mike, don't!
- Mike, where are you goin?

01:17:06.196 --> 01:17:07.029
- [Lauren] Mike, don't!

01:17:07.029 --> 01:17:10.987
Jessica.
(ominous music)

01:17:10.987 --> 01:17:13.737
(wolves howling)

01:17:23.596 --> 01:17:26.263
(door creaking)

01:17:29.735 --> 01:17:31.652
- Well that's not good.

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:36.800
(wolves howling)

01:17:51.386 --> 01:17:54.053
(ominous music)

01:19:11.126 --> 01:19:16.126
(Mike grunts)
(flashlight rattles)

01:19:30.657 --> 01:19:31.490
- I'll go.

01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:32.323
- No, wait, I'm coming with you.

01:19:32.323 --> 01:19:33.156
- No you're not!

01:19:33.156 --> 01:19:35.558
You're staying with Andi, let's go.

01:19:35.558 --> 01:19:39.725
- Be careful guys.
(ominous music)

01:19:44.804 --> 01:19:45.637
- Mike!

01:19:49.321 --> 01:19:53.866
Mike!
(dramatic ominous music)

01:19:53.866 --> 01:19:54.699
Hey man.

01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:57.737
Here he is.

01:19:57.737 --> 01:19:59.671
- [Lauren] Mike! Mike!

01:19:59.671 --> 01:20:01.141
- Here, hold this, hold this.
- Give me that!

01:20:01.141 --> 01:20:02.611
- Mike.
- Get him up.

01:20:02.611 --> 01:20:03.794
- [Kevin] You all right?

01:20:03.794 --> 01:20:06.461
- [Lauren] Let's get him inside.

01:20:08.286 --> 01:20:10.209
(ominous music)

01:20:10.209 --> 01:20:13.124
- This is all my fault okay.

01:20:13.124 --> 01:20:14.489
- [Lauren] Come on, bring him inside!

01:20:14.489 --> 01:20:15.904
- Mike!

01:20:15.904 --> 01:20:16.931
Mike are you okay?

01:20:16.931 --> 01:20:19.264
- Here, sit.
- What happened?

01:20:21.228 --> 01:20:22.763
(door banging)

01:20:22.763 --> 01:20:24.188
- [Jess] What the hell was that?

01:20:24.188 --> 01:20:25.613
- Maybe it was the police officer?

01:20:25.613 --> 01:20:28.488
- [Lauren] Do tell, Andi.

01:20:28.488 --> 01:20:29.589
Mike.

01:20:29.589 --> 01:20:31.909
Here, put this over here.

01:20:31.909 --> 01:20:33.056
Put this on your head.

01:20:33.056 --> 01:20:35.018
Put pressure on it.

01:20:35.018 --> 01:20:36.874
- Where's Mr. Mandl?

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:38.354
- That thing.

01:20:38.354 --> 01:20:40.823
- [Jess] Did you see it?

01:20:40.823 --> 01:20:42.142
- No.

01:20:42.142 --> 01:20:43.245
It happened so fast.

01:20:43.245 --> 01:20:46.027
He came out of nowhere
and just took me out.

01:20:46.027 --> 01:20:47.395
Why didn't it just kill me?

01:20:47.395 --> 01:20:48.393
(door banging)
(everyone gasps)

01:20:48.393 --> 01:20:49.704
What the hell was that?

01:20:49.704 --> 01:20:51.174
- Jess! Jess!

01:20:51.174 --> 01:20:53.311
Jess, get away from the window!

01:20:53.311 --> 01:20:54.533
- Come on Jess!
- Get away from the window!

01:20:54.533 --> 01:20:56.366
- [Andi] Come on Jess!

01:20:57.823 --> 01:21:00.416
- I don't understand,
why is this happening?

01:21:00.416 --> 01:21:01.996
- This is insane.

01:21:01.996 --> 01:21:03.714
This better not be another prank.

01:21:03.714 --> 01:21:06.201
- It's not a prank Mike.

01:21:06.201 --> 01:21:08.183
We were all there.

01:21:08.183 --> 01:21:10.223
- Where is everyone?

01:21:10.223 --> 01:21:11.056
Hey, Jess!

01:21:11.056 --> 01:21:11.889
- Shh.

01:21:13.046 --> 01:21:16.584
Look, where does that door lead to?

01:21:16.584 --> 01:21:17.923
- Hey.

01:21:17.923 --> 01:21:19.157
Don't.

01:21:19.157 --> 01:21:20.074
- I'm fine.

01:21:24.124 --> 01:21:26.207
Yeah, it's just a closet.

01:21:27.867 --> 01:21:29.195
Hey.

01:21:29.195 --> 01:21:30.825
Hey, look at this.
(suspenseful music)

01:21:30.825 --> 01:21:32.619
- [Kevin] Let's go find the others.

01:21:32.619 --> 01:21:34.241
- [Andi] Give me your flashlight.

01:21:34.241 --> 01:21:35.074
- In the living room.

01:21:35.074 --> 01:21:36.574
Come on, leave it.

01:21:40.784 --> 01:21:42.422
Jess, Lauren.

01:21:42.422 --> 01:21:43.281
- [Andi] Mike.

01:21:43.281 --> 01:21:45.321
(Andi screams)

01:21:45.321 --> 01:21:46.154
Jess!

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:49.766
- [Jess] Where's Lauren?

01:21:49.766 --> 01:21:51.086
- [Lauren] In here, you guys okay?

01:21:51.086 --> 01:21:52.263
- [Jess] Yeah, I'm okay.

01:21:52.263 --> 01:21:53.179
- [Andi] Hey, are you guys?

01:21:53.179 --> 01:21:54.857
- [Lauren] Yeah, we're good.

01:21:54.857 --> 01:21:57.015
- Dude, what are we gonna do?

01:21:57.015 --> 01:21:58.257
I've never seen any movie shit like this

01:21:58.257 --> 01:22:00.010
happen that ends well.

01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:00.931
- Nice Mike.
(ominous music)

01:22:00.931 --> 01:22:02.338
- If we can get to Lauren's car--

01:22:02.338 --> 01:22:04.870
- I don't have my keys,
I gave them to Mike!

01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:05.703
- Mike.

01:22:07.025 --> 01:22:07.936
- No.

01:22:07.936 --> 01:22:08.815
- Yes.
- I thought I have them

01:22:08.815 --> 01:22:09.648
- [Mike] back to you.

01:22:09.648 --> 01:22:10.481
- No.

01:22:10.481 --> 01:22:11.830
- Well there's the cops car too.

01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:15.177
We could just use that.
- Not enough light out there.

01:22:15.177 --> 01:22:16.044
- [Lauren] I'm sorry,
I should've taken you

01:22:16.044 --> 01:22:17.392
guys home when I had the chance.

01:22:17.392 --> 01:22:19.096
Dad's gonna be worried sick about you.

01:22:19.096 --> 01:22:21.011
- You can't blame yourself, okay?

01:22:21.011 --> 01:22:23.773
- You guys, we just gotta
make it to sunrise, right?

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:24.722
- Mike, what the hell does sunrise

01:22:24.722 --> 01:22:26.609
have to do with anything?
(wood creaking)

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:27.786
Idiot.

01:22:27.786 --> 01:22:31.190
(ominous music)
(bells jingling)

01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:32.772
What the hell was that?

01:22:32.772 --> 01:22:36.017
- [Jess] It's playing with us!

01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:38.267
- I can't take this anymore.

01:22:38.267 --> 01:22:40.362
- [Kevin] Only a couple of
hours til sunrise right?

01:22:40.362 --> 01:22:42.779
Let's go find another closet.

01:22:50.277 --> 01:22:53.496
- You know what, maybe
it is safer down there.

01:22:53.496 --> 01:22:55.430
- There's not even a ladder
to get us down there.

01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:56.794
- You know what, I'll go check it out.

01:22:56.794 --> 01:22:58.008
- No you won't, you're staying here.

01:22:58.008 --> 01:22:59.799
- Why are we even
checking out the basement?

01:22:59.799 --> 01:23:01.647
- Maybe there's a way out Mike.

01:23:01.647 --> 01:23:03.157
- Yeah, so is the front door.

01:23:03.157 --> 01:23:04.996
- We can't go out the front door Mike!

01:23:04.996 --> 01:23:07.907
You wanna die?
- Okay, I'm gonna go down.

01:23:07.907 --> 01:23:09.490
- No wait!

01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:10.839
Let me go.

01:23:10.839 --> 01:23:11.987
I'm the smallest one.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.616
I can fit down the hole better.

01:23:13.616 --> 01:23:14.629
(ominous music)

01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:15.883
- You sure?

01:23:15.883 --> 01:23:17.466
- Just give me the light.

01:23:17.466 --> 01:23:18.549
I'll be okay.

01:23:34.129 --> 01:23:34.962
It smells.

01:23:40.652 --> 01:23:42.569
I think I see a machine

01:23:45.385 --> 01:23:46.468
of some kind.

01:23:47.782 --> 01:23:50.615
I think it looks like an elevator.

01:23:54.792 --> 01:23:57.782
Have you seen an elevator
down in a basement before?

01:23:57.782 --> 01:24:00.865
- [Jess] No, what else is down there?

01:24:02.097 --> 01:24:03.739
- I don't know.

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:05.822
It's really hard to tell.

01:24:06.944 --> 01:24:08.277
I gotta go down.

01:24:15.370 --> 01:24:17.012
Okay, you got me?

01:24:17.012 --> 01:24:19.179
- [Kevin] Yeah, I got you.

01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:27.958
- [Andi] Flashlight.

01:24:48.344 --> 01:24:49.177
It's cold.

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.913
(heavy breathing)

01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.880
(Andi gasps)

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.163
It's just a mouse.

01:25:01.163 --> 01:25:02.663
It's just a mouse!

01:25:11.851 --> 01:25:14.018
I see something guys!

01:25:14.018 --> 01:25:15.601
Guys, it's in here!

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.423
- [Jess] Give me your hand!

01:25:19.423 --> 01:25:20.988
- Help me Jess!

01:25:20.988 --> 01:25:23.644
(animal growls)
(everyone screaming)

01:25:23.644 --> 01:25:25.342
- Jessica!
- Andi!

01:25:25.342 --> 01:25:27.338
- No!
- No, come here!

01:25:27.338 --> 01:25:29.798
- Stop, Jessica, stop it!
- Let me go!

01:25:29.798 --> 01:25:34.771
- [Lauren] Stop! Stop!
(Jess crying)

01:25:34.771 --> 01:25:35.862
Mike!

01:25:35.862 --> 01:25:37.750
What the hell!

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:42.032
- [Jess] Mike!
(animal growling)

01:25:42.032 --> 01:25:42.865
- Help me!

01:25:45.695 --> 01:25:46.612
Oh, oh God!

01:25:47.699 --> 01:25:50.440
(Mike groaning)

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.386
(car approaching)

01:25:53.386 --> 01:25:54.394
- Someone's here!

01:25:54.394 --> 01:25:55.394
- [Jess] Who is it?

01:25:55.394 --> 01:25:56.891
- It's Mom!

01:25:56.891 --> 01:25:59.641
Come on Jess!
- Hey, come on Mike!

01:26:00.565 --> 01:26:03.232
(Mike grunting)

01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:06.371
- [Mike] Hey guys, it's all messed up!

01:26:06.371 --> 01:26:08.454
You guys, don't leave me!

01:26:17.437 --> 01:26:19.020
- Jess, wait!
- Mom!

01:26:19.861 --> 01:26:20.944
- [Jess] Mom!

01:26:22.244 --> 01:26:23.452
Mom!

01:26:23.452 --> 01:26:24.558
Oh my God!

01:26:24.558 --> 01:26:27.816
(animal growling)

01:26:27.816 --> 01:26:29.794
(women screaming)

01:26:29.794 --> 01:26:31.521
- Jess! Go!

01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:32.938
Get in the house!

01:26:34.749 --> 01:26:36.871
(heavy breathing)

01:26:36.871 --> 01:26:38.984
- [Jennifer] Jess, what's going on?

01:26:38.984 --> 01:26:39.886
What's going on?

01:26:39.886 --> 01:26:41.160
- Why are you here Mom?

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.648
Why are you here?

01:26:42.648 --> 01:26:44.290
- We've been trying to reach you for days.

01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:45.759
- Where's Dad?

01:26:45.759 --> 01:26:46.592
Where is he?

01:26:46.592 --> 01:26:47.446
Where's Dad?

01:26:47.446 --> 01:26:49.015
- He's okay, he's okay.

01:26:49.015 --> 01:26:50.274
He's at the hospital.
- What?

01:26:50.274 --> 01:26:51.416
- [Jennifer] He's okay.

01:26:51.416 --> 01:26:52.249
He's stabilized.

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:54.243
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Yes! Yes!

01:26:54.243 --> 01:26:56.122
- Oh, Mike!
- Wait, Jess, Jess!

01:26:56.122 --> 01:26:57.122
Wait!
- Jess!

01:26:58.075 --> 01:27:00.574
- Oh my God, let's go!
- What are you doing?

01:27:00.574 --> 01:27:01.647
- [Jennifer] Oh God!

01:27:01.647 --> 01:27:03.361
- Move, Jess, move!

01:27:03.361 --> 01:27:05.365
(monster growling)

01:27:05.365 --> 01:27:06.198
- What's that?

01:27:06.198 --> 01:27:07.031
- It's been messing with us.

01:27:07.031 --> 01:27:08.283
We gotta go, we gotta go!

01:27:08.283 --> 01:27:09.552
- Come on hon, come on!

01:27:09.552 --> 01:27:12.239
- Come on, you have to try!

01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:14.906
(ominous music)

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.110
- [Jess] Guys, run.

01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.943
Run!

01:27:21.943 --> 01:27:24.776
(heavy breathing)

01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:32.806
- I got him, I got him!

01:27:32.806 --> 01:27:33.639
- Jess!

01:27:34.519 --> 01:27:35.602
- Guys, wait!

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:38.958
Mike, get up, get up!

01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:40.625
- I can't.
- Come on!

01:27:42.025 --> 01:27:44.692
(ominous music)

01:27:45.926 --> 01:27:48.759

01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:20.530
(suspenseful music)
(leaves rustling)

01:28:31.269 --> 01:28:32.102
- Come on!

01:28:35.306 --> 01:28:36.162
Come on, you have to help me!

01:28:36.162 --> 01:28:37.912
- No, I need to rest!

01:28:39.728 --> 01:28:40.805
- [Lauren] You okay?

01:28:40.805 --> 01:28:41.826
- No!

01:28:41.826 --> 01:28:42.788
- [Lauren] Stay, I'm gonna look for help!

01:28:42.788 --> 01:28:44.538
- Don't leave me, no!

01:28:54.014 --> 01:28:55.764
Don't leave me again!

01:28:57.059 --> 01:28:59.892
(heavy breathing)

01:29:02.261 --> 01:29:07.261

01:29:34.088 --> 01:29:34.921

01:30:26.734 --> 01:30:28.908
(rain falling)

01:30:35.674 --> 01:30:36.744
- [Jess] You know, they say there's two

01:30:36.744 --> 01:30:40.161
wolf spirits that are fighting within us.

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:45.217
One is good, filled with
peace, love, and hope.

01:30:47.029 --> 01:30:50.946
The other is evil, angry,
arrogant, and greedy.

01:30:53.627 --> 01:30:55.778
I wonder which one I'll become.

01:30:55.778 --> 01:30:58.611
(angelic humming)

01:30:59.518 --> 01:31:00.351
They say,

01:31:01.301 --> 01:31:03.134
it's the one you feed.

01:31:05.324 --> 01:31:07.907
(tribal music)

01:31:19.011 --> 01:31:21.152
Which one will you feed?
