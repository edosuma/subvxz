WEBVTT

00:28.070 --> 00:29.526
June 29th. 25 degrees.

00:32.573 --> 00:33.984
I will take notes everyday...

00:37.663 --> 00:39.528
I'm very smart,

00:39.957 --> 00:42.824
and I study very hard.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.295
I'm sure I'll be someone
great in the future.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.734
Are onee-San"s breasts
and my mother's different?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.358
Unable to reproduce
the shape with bowls.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.879
I'm still in the 4th grade,
but I already know

00:54.054 --> 00:55.734
onee-San a study of the
geometry of breasts

00:55.973 --> 00:57.588
as much as some adults.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.891
Everyday,

01:01.228 --> 01:03.093
I learn about the world.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.561
I become a better person.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.604
Brother, time to eat!

01:10.904 --> 01:13.020
- Eat up.
- I ran a calculation today...

01:13.240 --> 01:14.855
I figured out that

01:15.117 --> 01:18.325
it'll be another 3,888 days
until I become an adult.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.030
You're not going to eat?

01:22.040 --> 01:25.248
I can't imagine just
how amazing I'll be

01:25.627 --> 01:26.627
when that day comes.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.119
I might be too amazing
for my own good.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.505
- I'm leaving!
- See you later!

01:31.633 --> 01:33.373
Brother, I'm leaving already.

01:33.635 --> 01:34.750
See you later.

01:44.021 --> 01:47.184
I'm sure that lots of girls
will want to marry me.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.313
But there's already
someone I have in mind.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.023
So the others will
just have to live with it.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.195
I feel bad for everyone else,

02:03.373 --> 02:04.863
but this has already
been decided.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.161
There's something over there!
What is it?

02:10.839 --> 02:13.046
- They're crows, I bet.
- No, they're not!

02:13.216 --> 02:14.922
I can't tell from here.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.633
Let's go take a look! Yeah!

02:16.803 --> 02:19.510
Hey, wait!
There's like ten of them!

02:27.272 --> 02:28.978
- Hey!
- Aoyamal!

04:49.372 --> 04:51.658
Did you hear about the penguins?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.116
So there really were
penguins in that field!

04:54.377 --> 04:56.368
- No way.
- There totally were.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.129
I've only seen them in the zoo.

04:59.841 --> 05:03.959
Penguins live in Antarctica
and the islands nearby.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.798
That's what I read in a book.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.385
They don't live in the suburbs.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.971
Why were those penguins
in that field?

05:14.105 --> 05:17.097
Were they even real penguins?

05:18.026 --> 05:20.267
And where did they
even come from, anyway?

05:21.238 --> 05:24.981
I need to investigate
this incident.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.242
Aoyama.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.695
What do you think about
the penguins, aoyama?

05:31.122 --> 05:34.831
I have six different hypotheses
on why they've appeared here.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.834
The first is that they escaped
from a zoo vehicle.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.995
The second is that
they're abandoned pets.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.731
The third is that
they're crows that have

05:41.800 --> 05:43.440
undergone a sudden
mutation to become fat.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.672
Uchida and I have formed
an expedition team.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.847
Project Amazon

05:48.557 --> 05:51.139
right now, we're identifying
the source of this river.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.766
We call this research
project Amazon.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.389
Let's see if there's any
penguins on the way back.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.350
I can't. I'm going to the
dentist after school today.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.529
Does tomorrow work?

06:03.655 --> 06:04.144
Sure.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.402
You're all little kids.

06:06.741 --> 06:10.279
Who cares about some penguins?

06:10.996 --> 06:14.409
I've seen tons of them
at the zoo.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.579
But they were in a field!

06:18.920 --> 06:21.161
Shut up!

06:21.798 --> 06:25.086
Suzuki is the most
arrogant guy in the class.

06:26.303 --> 06:30.091
The males under his control
are completely loyal to him.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.884
I don't care about any penguins.

06:37.355 --> 06:41.189
Aoyama, what's so fun
about writing all that up?

06:41.443 --> 06:44.355
We don't think that penguins in
and of themselves are abnormal.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.190
We think it's strange
that penguins

06:46.364 --> 06:47.649
have appeared in the suburbs.

06:47.782 --> 06:48.612
What?

06:48.783 --> 06:49.397
If you saw them,

06:49.576 --> 06:51.096
you'd probably think
it was weird, too.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.986
I did see them!
What's wrong with you?

06:54.164 --> 06:55.164
Get out of here.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.083
Uchida.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.332
What's with him?

06:59.794 --> 07:00.954
You're not interested at all?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.662
What do you want?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.330
I don't care at all.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.796
The theory of relativity

07:09.346 --> 07:10.346
that book...

07:11.222 --> 07:12.678
Did you read it, aoyama?

07:12.849 --> 07:13.429
Yeah.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.681
I was interested in black holes,

07:15.852 --> 07:17.638
but the book
was a bit difficult.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.677
Same here.
Pretty difficult stuff.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.104
Hmm? I see.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.936
Penguins are cute.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.361
Penguins are boring.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.363
Hamamoto is extremely smart
and good at chess.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.124
She might be even
more amazing than I am.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.875
As you can tell,
I'm not conceited,

07:47.175 --> 07:48.711
and that makes me great.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.752
I'm out! That's enough!

08:02.399 --> 08:03.399
Hello.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.556
Thank you.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.734
No problem.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.213
Suzuki.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.788
What do you want?

08:28.216 --> 08:32.049
You have that disease, as well?
I can tell by looking at you.

08:32.761 --> 08:33.922
What disease?

08:34.222 --> 08:37.009
You don't know? It's called
stanislaw's syndrome.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.592
It's a terrifying disease where

08:38.727 --> 08:40.058
all your teeth have
to be pulled.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.644
I've never heard of that.

08:42.938 --> 08:46.773
My mom only said I was getting
my wisdom teeth out...

08:47.861 --> 08:49.772
A mother wouldn't
tell their kid they're

08:49.946 --> 08:51.937
getting all their teeth pulled.
Too scary.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.359
Slowly but surely, all your
teeth will be pulled.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.614
That's what happened to me.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.818
But I think you have a right

08:58.997 --> 09:00.862
to know what's going
to happen to you.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.618
Seriously?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.745
The only way to stop
the spread of the

09:04.919 --> 09:06.625
disease is to pull
all of your teeth.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.379
If you don't, the bacteria
will spread,

09:09.549 --> 09:11.164
and your face will swell up.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.254
These mushroom-looking
things will start

09:13.428 --> 09:14.964
growing from the cracks
in your teeth.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.180
And after much pain,

09:16.723 --> 09:18.088
you'll die.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.715
Suzuki!

09:22.937 --> 09:24.973
In order to prevent that
from happening,

09:25.148 --> 09:26.638
the dentist will put you under,

09:26.816 --> 09:28.352
and slowly remove your teeth.

09:28.651 --> 09:32.815
But it's okay. You'll only be
in pain for a month.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.570
Suzuki, please.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.864
Do I have this "Stan" thing?

09:44.125 --> 09:45.125
What?

09:45.168 --> 09:48.126
You don't have to pull my teeth
if I brush properly, right?

09:48.296 --> 09:49.877
We're not pulling
all of your teeth.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.788
You're lying!
You're trying to trick me!

10:08.149 --> 10:09.685
Young man.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.861
Why did you say that to suzuki?
Don't you feel bad for him?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.646
I feel bad for uchida.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.148
Who's uchida?

10:18.326 --> 10:21.318
This is not your problem.
You don't need to know.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.701
You baby. Guess you learned
how to dodge questions.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.955
Silly brat.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.342
This lady is a woman
who I've gotten

10:42.517 --> 10:44.257
to know here at the dentist.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.550
Hey there.

10:45.728 --> 10:49.516
Sorry, I'm teaching
this kid a lesson.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.032
I might have done something
a little immature.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.817
Well, you're still a kid.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.829
Suzuki was being mean to uchida.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.957
But uchida didn't really
ask me to get him back.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.368
So, I don't really
have the right to

11:11.546 --> 11:13.958
punish suzuki for what
he did to uchida.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.498
I should have talked
to uchida first,

11:16.676 --> 11:17.836
at the bare minimum.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.093
You've sure got a lot going on.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.844
Oh, look at this.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.175
Penguins are mysterious,
aren't they?

11:27.353 --> 11:29.093
Who knows what's going
on with them?

11:29.480 --> 11:32.222
Do you know about what
happened this morning?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.058
I heard. Even more
mysterious, huh?

11:35.945 --> 11:38.231
I love penguins.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.113
All right.
I'm going to take this.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.200
This looks a bit like you.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.237
Small,
but still full of himself.

11:52.045 --> 11:52.830
Research lab

11:53.004 --> 11:54.044
anhy number of stories.

11:54.422 --> 11:58.882
But how much do you really know
about the voyagers?

11:59.135 --> 12:00.591
The adÃ©lie penguin.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.504
Scientific name:
Pygoscelis adeliae.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.558
This is the path
that penguins take

12:13.733 --> 12:15.815
when they come back
from the ocean.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.268
The penguin highway...

12:21.574 --> 12:22.905
Penguin highway

12:37.590 --> 12:41.299
Good name.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.256
They really took me by surprise.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.899
I didn't think one of them
would come running out.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.156
I couldn't believe it.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.443
Young man,
look at the chess board.

13:49.871 --> 13:50.871
I am.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.697
You keep looking at my boobs.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.167
Il am not.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.540
You're not looking. You're
looking at something else.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.957
Yes, I am. And no I'm not.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.129
I worry about your future.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.347
They come from the south pole,

14:11.517 --> 14:13.098
but they can somehow
survive here.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.685
What if they were being
transported

14:15.855 --> 14:17.186
somewhere and escaped?

14:17.565 --> 14:19.681
Wouldn't we have heard
something from a

14:19.859 --> 14:21.975
zoo or a pet store?
The mystery deepens.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.983
So what have you deduced?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.028
There's still not
enough information.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.986
I think aliens
brought them here.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.581
Why do you think that?

14:34.916 --> 14:37.498
They're invading.
Penguins are cute, you see?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.325
The aliens are counting on that,

14:39.504 --> 14:41.415
and when everyone
lets their guard down...

14:41.631 --> 14:43.838
They're going to take over
the un headquarters.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.507
I see. Makes sense, logically.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.878
You're teasing me, aren't you?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.291
Don't make me take
your teeth out.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.760
Anyway, that's enough for today.
You're tired, aren't you?

14:56.979 --> 14:58.219
I'm fine.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.101
Just tell the truth.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.194
- Welcome.
- Good evening.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.813
It's time to go home.

15:10.326 --> 15:14.114
Sorry for being so late.
Not too much trouble, I hope.

15:14.288 --> 15:17.780
No, I'm having a great time.
Aoyama is a smart kid.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.790
I guess I'm smart.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.505
It's good you like your
research, but how

15:26.676 --> 15:28.291
about brushing your teeth
from now on?

15:28.553 --> 15:30.089
I just totally forgot.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.211
I'm rather busy.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.676
It's true you do a lot, but...

15:34.851 --> 15:37.763
Say there's a busy person
that brushes their teeth,

15:37.937 --> 15:39.052
and one that doesn't.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.670
Which one would
you consider smarter?

15:40.731 --> 15:42.187
Well, in that case,
I would have to

15:42.358 --> 15:43.894
say the one that
brushes their teeth.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.193
See you later! =I'll be back.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.371
See you.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.326
I wanna help!

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
Go ahead!

16:03.880 --> 16:05.871
Aoyama!

16:12.180 --> 16:14.671
Penguin locations

16:19.562 --> 16:20.347
they're not here.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.806
Field

16:22.106 --> 16:23.221
not here.

16:23.858 --> 16:24.858
Yoshida's house

16:24.984 --> 16:26.394
not here, either.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.569
Central park

16:27.945 --> 16:30.106
I can't find any penguins.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.530
Is that a penguin?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.319
Oh, it's just a cat.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.405
Those are boob cakes.

16:41.626 --> 16:42.957
Are they really called that?

16:44.045 --> 16:46.787
Guess we'll just have to
switch to project Amazon.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.376
Who knew this was behind the school?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.888
We've traveled pretty far.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.387
This canal might go all the way
to the edge of the world.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.976
The edge of the world?

17:07.276 --> 17:08.276
Yeah.

17:08.361 --> 17:12.444
Does that mean the
water falls off the end?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.901
I don't think that's
really what's going on.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.570
But it'd be cool if it was.

17:18.037 --> 17:22.827
Yeah, the earth is round.
That means there's no "edge".

17:23.125 --> 17:25.958
Yes, which means that the
actual "edge" of the world...

17:26.170 --> 17:27.955
Would be where
the air reaches space.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.222
I wonder if we're almost to
the source of the stream.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.393
Yeah.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.512
I think that boobs

17:46.983 --> 17:48.143
are mysterious.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.944
I keep thinking
of onee-San's boobs.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.860
Her boobs aren't
the same as my mom's.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.362
They're the same
category of object,

17:59.537 --> 18:01.118
but the feeling they give me...

18:01.706 --> 18:03.571
I wonder why they affect
me so differently.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.406
What do you think, uchida?

18:05.918 --> 18:08.125
I don't know, man...

18:15.219 --> 18:17.551
22, 23, 24, 25...

18:17.722 --> 18:20.634
26, 27, 28, 29, 30!

18:20.975 --> 18:22.465
There's too many to count!

18:22.602 --> 18:24.217
This is amazing, aoyama!

18:24.395 --> 18:26.386
This must be a penguin highway.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.100
Their rookery should
be up ahead.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.943
We've lost them.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.113
I wonder if we went
the wrong way.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.658
The penguins' rookery might
be beyond this forest.

18:48.836 --> 18:49.836
Wait, aoyama!

18:50.963 --> 18:54.581
The silver moon appears
deep in this forest, right?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.920
That's just a rumor.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.751
Yeah, but...

19:01.682 --> 19:06.142
They say that if you see the
silver moon you'll get sick.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.894
There's no evidence for that.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.017
It's fine. Let's go.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.778
This 1s all weird. I've never
seen anything like this.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.117
This is getting kind of scary...

19:27.291 --> 19:28.291
Hey there!

19:30.836 --> 19:32.292
You liar!

19:32.546 --> 19:34.082
You liar!

19:34.256 --> 19:35.336
What lie?

19:35.966 --> 19:38.006
You said all that weird
stuff at the dentist, right?

19:38.260 --> 19:40.751
Oh, you mean when
you started crying?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.795
Stop it with your lies!

19:47.061 --> 19:48.767
I'm going to punish you.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.886
Both of you.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.431
No, we're busy.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.558
Hey, you!

20:08.165 --> 20:09.165
Sorry!

20:09.291 --> 20:11.077
Darn it!

20:11.252 --> 20:12.617
Get them!

20:18.676 --> 20:20.462
Wait up!

20:24.640 --> 20:26.050
Hey!

20:35.693 --> 20:38.025
I feel the need to say this,
but I feel

20:38.195 --> 20:40.186
bad about what happened.
I'm sorry.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.740
Shut up!

20:50.541 --> 20:51.906
That's what you get.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.203
Yeah, what you get.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.171
What are you doing, young man?

21:41.675 --> 21:43.381
Pretending to be
a vending machine.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.173
I'll take a cola, then.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.504
That'll be 120 yen.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.641
Here you are.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.556
Can't get this open.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.058
Not a very good
vending machine, are we?

21:57.274 --> 21:59.936
Looks like I'm going
to have to go home.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.855
Please help me.

22:04.657 --> 22:08.115
No need to be so cocky.
You could have just said so.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.115
That sucks.

22:12.289 --> 22:15.372
Though it's your fault that
you lied to suzuki, too.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.245
If you were there
this whole time,

22:17.419 --> 22:18.454
you could have helped.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.413
I make it a point not to
interfere in childish squabbles.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.372
What were you doing?

22:23.676 --> 22:26.668
I wanted to take a bus,
but I was tired and fell asleep.

22:26.846 --> 22:27.846
Happens sometimes.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.674
Want me to pull that out?

22:29.849 --> 22:32.465
I'm fine.
I'll get it out myself.

22:32.643 --> 22:35.180
I'll do it nice for ya.
It'll be an experiment.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.015
I see. I like experiments.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.355
Let's see...

22:40.776 --> 22:42.858
Stay nice and still...

22:45.739 --> 22:48.105
Now, young man.
I'll pull this string,

22:48.284 --> 22:50.616
and we'll see if your
tooth comes out.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.328
Okay...

23:02.506 --> 23:03.506
Hey!

23:03.966 --> 23:07.550
I'm not scared.
My body's moving on its own.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.510
I know.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.714
I have a good idea.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.599
Watch closely.

23:16.604 --> 23:17.719
There we go!

23:21.400 --> 23:22.560
I thought there

23:23.193 --> 23:24.683
was no way that

23:25.154 --> 23:26.610
this would get
my tooth out, but...

23:56.685 --> 23:57.685
Here you go.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.304
What's that?

24:02.566 --> 24:03.772
A penguin.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.025
Here you go. It's out.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.026
I'm pretty
mysterious myself, huh?

24:17.331 --> 24:19.117
Try solving this mystery.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.957
Do you think you can?

24:48.570 --> 24:51.061
Brother, wake up!

24:51.240 --> 24:52.275
Wake up!

24:53.701 --> 24:54.941
Hey!

24:55.536 --> 24:57.652
Let me out!

24:59.707 --> 25:02.449
Boo! You're like an old man
without his teeth!

25:05.713 --> 25:06.543
Let me out, brother!

25:06.714 --> 25:07.829
Let me out, brother!

25:08.007 --> 25:09.287
Onee-San took out my baby tooth.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.212
Dad!

25:12.428 --> 25:15.170
I have witnessed
a surprising phenomenon,

25:15.347 --> 25:17.087
but I have no hard evidence.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.631
I cannot report it as of yet.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.599
Could you give me a hint?

25:22.062 --> 25:23.598
The lady from the dentist.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.138
She's rather mysterious
and fascinating!

25:26.483 --> 25:29.270
I see. You've found yourself
a wonderful subject.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.237
Here's your usual reward.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.943
Dad, could I have some coffee?

25:40.330 --> 25:41.911
If you must.

25:47.671 --> 25:48.786
It's bitter.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.720
Requires more experimentation!

26:04.813 --> 26:07.805
Hey, aoyama!
Let's have fun again sometime!

26:07.983 --> 26:10.065
Sorry, I'm extremely busy.

26:13.947 --> 26:14.947
Well...

26:15.407 --> 26:18.490
I'm not really sure, myself.

26:18.744 --> 26:19.984
Really?

26:20.954 --> 26:23.821
Yeah, it's a mystery to me,
as well.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.033
But you might be able
to solve this.

26:28.212 --> 26:29.497
How about we give it a shot?

26:30.130 --> 26:31.130
Okay!

26:31.340 --> 26:32.580
Let's do this.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.209
What's this?

26:37.554 --> 26:39.545
Samples for experimentation.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.425
Pretty well thought out, huh?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.556
I guess that's why you're
a little scientist.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.804
Now, please toss them.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.063
I'll start with this jar.

26:52.736 --> 26:53.736
Here we go!

27:07.334 --> 27:08.334
Nothing happened.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.460
Yes...

27:10.963 --> 27:11.963
Next.

27:13.549 --> 27:14.549
Next.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.841
Frying pan, baseball
tin, glasses case

27:19.388 --> 27:20.468
what do you think?

27:20.889 --> 27:23.346
Let's try replicating the
conditions from yesterday.

27:36.697 --> 27:40.565
I'm tired. Let's call it a day.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.908
No, we keep experimenting.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.198
I don't think we're going
to see anything today.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.156
When do you tend
to get penguins?

27:48.542 --> 27:49.873
Please give me something.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.950
Well...

27:52.129 --> 27:55.963
I start to feel good,
like I can't contain it,

27:56.300 --> 27:57.915
and then I get a penguin.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.465
I just toss something.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.090
You really can't bring
out a penguin?

28:06.727 --> 28:09.093
Are you messing with me?

28:11.023 --> 28:13.230
You do this on your own, then.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.957
I'm sorry. I was being immature.

28:32.878 --> 28:35.335
You're just a kid, so it's fine.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.632
I'll be an adult in 3,831 days.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.417
You've got to be kidding me.
You calculated that?

28:46.600 --> 28:47.385
Dad's 3 steps
to solving a problem:

28:47.559 --> 28:48.298
Break your problem
into smaller pieces.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.307
View your problem from
different angles.

28:49.478 --> 28:50.598
Search for similar problems.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.815
Why do the penguins head
towards the forest?

28:56.985 --> 28:58.350
Why does onee-San create them?

28:58.528 --> 28:59.984
Penguin highway

29:01.573 --> 29:04.440
sorry I ran away
and left you behind.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.154
It's fine.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.069
Sorry I couldn't save the map.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.741
Let's do better next time.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.581
You don't get mad, do you?

29:13.877 --> 29:16.789
Just think about boobs if you
think you're going to get angry.

29:17.339 --> 29:20.046
You'll feel extremely
calm instead.

29:20.968 --> 29:24.586
I don't think that's a
good thing to think about.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.553
Well, it's not the
only thing on my mind.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.390
Probably only about
thirty minutes a day.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.262
Uchida, you wanted to
show me something?

29:35.440 --> 29:36.440
Yeah.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.810
Penta!

29:40.946 --> 29:41.946
Oh, it's a penguin.

29:42.406 --> 29:43.406
This is penta.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.652
I found him in my apartment's

29:45.826 --> 29:47.657
parking garage,
and hid him here.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.448
Surprise no one has found him.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.788
He hides when people come.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.781
That's a rather smart penguin.

29:55.002 --> 29:58.745
Well, he hasn't been
eating food at all.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.289
He's really not eating
anything at all?

30:02.634 --> 30:06.502
I give him fish, ham,
cucumbers, rice balls...

30:06.638 --> 30:08.503
He won't eat anything.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.640
Eat up. You're not hungry?

30:12.602 --> 30:13.808
There you go.

30:16.773 --> 30:17.792
The penguins
that onee-San creates

30:17.816 --> 30:18.601
can survive without
eating anything.

30:18.775 --> 30:19.836
They run on some unknown
energy source.

30:19.860 --> 30:20.860
E = penguin energy

30:22.904 --> 30:26.237
we'll take you somewhere nice,
so sit still in there for now.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.496
I love the aquarium.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.377
It'll be fun.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.547
Yeah.

30:42.090 --> 30:45.423
Hopefully we'll find some
food he can eat.

30:45.594 --> 30:46.594
Yeah.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.842
Aoyama, what was...

30:55.228 --> 30:56.228
Right.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.064
Penta!

31:02.319 --> 31:04.275
Maybe he gets motion sickness.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.319
Let's get off
at the next station.

31:11.328 --> 31:14.536
Kadoichimatsu. Kadoichimatsu.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.548
He was fine just a while ago.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.136
Something's happening.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.263
I'm going to open this, uchida.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.142
Okay.

31:38.647 --> 31:39.727
Penta!

31:46.530 --> 31:47.610
Penta!

31:50.951 --> 31:52.657
Penta! Uchida!

32:02.003 --> 32:03.083
Penta...

32:06.216 --> 32:07.496
Here's my deductions thus far...

32:07.551 --> 32:08.290
E = penguin energy

32:08.468 --> 32:09.654
penguins run on some sort
of unknown energy source.

32:09.678 --> 32:10.383
The penguins onee-San
creates must be

32:10.554 --> 32:11.259
getting energy from
somewhere else.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.716
I've named this penguin energy.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.300
The penguin was able to live
without eating anything,

32:18.728 --> 32:19.968
but when we left the city,

32:20.147 --> 32:22.138
the penguin lost its mass
and disappeared.

32:22.816 --> 32:25.148
This matches up with what
happened with that truck.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.893
This penguin energy
might come from

32:28.071 --> 32:30.357
somewhere in the city,
or from you.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.155
You look tired.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.534
I can't really get
any sleep lately.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.323
I keep having bad dreams.

32:42.252 --> 32:43.458
Bad dreams?

32:47.215 --> 32:49.080
I read this 'cause
it has chess in it,

32:49.259 --> 32:51.090
and got really scared
for some reason.

32:51.845 --> 32:55.133
There's this creepy monster
called the jabberwocky.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.013
I keep dreaming about it.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.100
So there are things
that scare you, huh?

33:01.646 --> 33:03.352
Of course there are.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.982
I don't like mice, cockroaches,
and bats, too.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.148
What's going on?

33:11.364 --> 33:14.026
Oh, the breaker tripped.

33:14.826 --> 33:15.906
Ow.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.578
Aoyama, are you scared?

33:28.215 --> 33:31.457
No, but I think
I might get sleepy.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.098
There's a weird phenomenon
going on.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.429
Yeah.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.194
You...

33:53.281 --> 33:54.316
Bats!

33:55.158 --> 33:58.150
How did they get in here?
I'll get a net!

34:04.209 --> 34:05.324
How did you do it?

34:06.086 --> 34:08.121
I don't know.

34:08.295 --> 34:10.496
Have you ever manifested
something other than a penguin?

34:10.715 --> 34:11.750
No.

34:13.635 --> 34:17.297
Let me do another experiment!

34:25.021 --> 34:27.808
Young man, when do I throw this?

34:28.108 --> 34:30.099
Very soon,
according to my estimates.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.434
Can I?

34:32.696 --> 34:33.696
Not yet.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.123
Now!

34:48.837 --> 34:51.373
All right! There we go!

34:57.637 --> 34:58.637
Oh!

35:01.308 --> 35:02.388
We got one!

35:02.642 --> 35:03.677
Why?

35:03.935 --> 35:07.393
I have one hypothesis on
when a penguin can manifest.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.520
It has to do with the light!

35:10.108 --> 35:11.143
Light?

35:11.651 --> 35:16.020
When you manifested a penguin
before, it was sunny out.

35:16.448 --> 35:20.157
The next day when I tried the
experiment, it was cloudy.

35:20.535 --> 35:21.775
That's true.

35:22.245 --> 35:26.079
It was sunny when the penguins
first appeared last week.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.909
And then in the dark,
you manifested bats.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.125
Penguin manifestation conditions

35:31.296 --> 35:34.629
in other words,
when it's sunny out...

35:34.924 --> 35:36.585
You can manifest penguins.

35:37.052 --> 35:41.261
When it's cloudy or dark,
you can't manifest penguins,

35:41.473 --> 35:43.930
but you manifest bats
and the like.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.558
However, more verification
is required...

35:48.146 --> 35:49.556
What are you...

35:55.987 --> 35:59.104
You're right. This is amazing.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.129
The weather forecast said
it'd clear up after the rain.

36:21.805 --> 36:24.012
That was sudden.

36:24.849 --> 36:27.386
It took some time, but you
figured it out.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.640
A child of science.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.803
There's still
a lot to solve here.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.147
We don't know what exactly
is happening,

36:34.317 --> 36:35.898
and what this penguin energy is.

36:36.403 --> 36:41.113
You sure love research.
Today we have to celebrate.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.156
Why are you standing
over there, young man?

36:53.211 --> 36:54.291
Right.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.458
Excuse me.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.465
Now you wait quietly here.

37:12.272 --> 37:13.808
It's ready.

37:21.906 --> 37:22.906
Is it good?

37:23.074 --> 37:23.859
It is.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.864
That's good.

37:31.458 --> 37:35.542
You grew up by the sea, right?

37:35.754 --> 37:37.164
Yeah, why?

37:37.922 --> 37:39.503
What was it like?

37:40.967 --> 37:45.882
Well... there were lots of hills
as you headed towards the water.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.091
My house was higher up,

37:52.270 --> 37:55.103
so I could see the ocean
from there.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.561
When the wind blew
through the windows,

37:58.735 --> 37:59.895
it'd smell like the ocean.

38:02.489 --> 38:05.276
What does the ocean smell like?

38:06.075 --> 38:09.408
You haven't seen the ocean,
have you?

38:10.872 --> 38:12.578
All right.

38:12.916 --> 38:16.784
If you solve my mystery, I will
take you to the seaside.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.535
Really?

38:18.838 --> 38:23.252
So young man,
you better solve my mystery.

38:24.594 --> 38:27.836
I will. I'm smart.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.850
You've gotten better.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.312
Not good enough.
Hamamoto is extremely good.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.893
Who's hamamoto?

38:43.112 --> 38:47.321
A girl in my class. She knows
the theory of relativity.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.025
So that's what's
got you so in love.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.535
I won't fall in love
with anyone.

38:52.747 --> 38:53.747
I'm not sure about that.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.501
You're the tired one, today.

39:00.713 --> 39:01.873
I'm not tired.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.751
Now you're lying.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.598
When did you go
to sleep last night?

39:13.810 --> 39:15.550
I always go to bed at 9 pm.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.103
I see.
You don't stay up late, then.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.494
Does something special
happen late at night?

39:21.651 --> 39:26.315
Yes, everyone goes to bed,
and the town gets dark.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.229
You get to go exploring.

39:33.955 --> 39:36.321
Are you sure you're
not tired because

39:36.499 --> 39:38.535
you manifested
too many penguins?

39:39.335 --> 39:40.450
I don't know.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.166
But I do like making them.

39:44.591 --> 39:49.130
I'd love to fill this
world up with penguins.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.947
You shouldn't get
too ahead of yourself.

39:51.514 --> 39:54.677
We don't know
how all this works,

39:54.851 --> 39:56.682
but the penguin energy
could come from you.

40:05.111 --> 40:08.899
I wonder why her face
was made in this shape.

40:10.116 --> 40:14.359
Why do I feel happy when
I watch her like this?

40:15.455 --> 40:17.446
How could DNA
combine in such a way

40:17.916 --> 40:19.998
that I find her face so nice,

40:20.460 --> 40:22.166
and that she's laying
here before me?

40:35.850 --> 40:36.952
Sleeping, DNA,
happiness, perfection

40:36.976 --> 40:39.308
this is the first time I've
felt so strange like this...

40:39.604 --> 40:41.640
I didn't quite know
what to write.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.542
You're up.

41:13.012 --> 41:16.345
I couldn't see her
for a while after that.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.695
So... the edge of the world?

41:33.282 --> 41:34.818
Not literally, anyway.

41:35.201 --> 41:38.910
An actual edge would have
to be far away, I know.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.866
Like deep in space.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.624
That might not be the case.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.504
The edge might not be as far
away as you think.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.838
That's what I think.

41:52.635 --> 41:53.920
What do you mean?

41:54.262 --> 41:56.969
The edge might
be folded in on itself.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.426
You might have to look within.

42:01.644 --> 42:05.978
Do you think you could put
the world into this pouch?

42:09.068 --> 42:10.228
I don't know.

42:11.112 --> 42:12.443
If you do this...

42:14.073 --> 42:15.779
Take a look.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.862
The insides have become the
outsides. And now the world,

42:19.037 --> 42:20.948
is contained within the pouch.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.704
And you could say that the
outer part of the world

42:23.916 --> 42:26.749
is now hidden within here.

42:28.796 --> 42:32.334
I guess that was a bit
difficult. Think about it.

42:52.945 --> 42:55.231
You did it, aoyama!

42:55.406 --> 42:57.271
Aoyama, let's play again.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.161
Chess is boring.

43:10.671 --> 43:11.786
Aoyama.

43:13.007 --> 43:16.124
I'd like to talk to you
for a second...

43:23.559 --> 43:24.639
Over here.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.099
Um... aoyama...

43:29.273 --> 43:29.978
Hmm?

43:30.149 --> 43:32.356
Is it okay for me to tag along?

43:33.236 --> 43:35.477
It's fine. What's wrong?

43:35.780 --> 43:38.487
Aoyama, hurry up!

43:42.954 --> 43:43.954
Over here.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.783
Hey hamamoto,
this is the forest where

43:46.958 --> 43:48.789
the silver moon
comes out, right?

43:49.127 --> 43:50.742
That's just a made up story.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.410
Huh? It is?

43:52.797 --> 43:54.503
I'm the one who
told everyone that.

43:58.553 --> 43:59.553
Come with me.

44:06.352 --> 44:09.389
Aoyama, you're really
going in there?

44:10.606 --> 44:12.813
Wait for me!

44:40.845 --> 44:41.925
What's wrong?

44:42.096 --> 44:43.506
We're almost there!

45:07.455 --> 45:10.492
Who knew this place
was hidden in the forest?

45:19.300 --> 45:20.665
Wow...

45:20.885 --> 45:22.796
Hamamoto, what is this?

45:24.138 --> 45:26.880
This is the ocean.
At least that's what I call it.

45:27.975 --> 45:28.975
Ocean?

45:30.353 --> 45:32.309
This is an extremely
strange object.

45:33.064 --> 45:34.679
What is causing it to float?

45:34.857 --> 45:37.223
I don't know.
That's why I'm researching it.

45:37.944 --> 45:40.902
The ocean gets bigger
and smaller at times.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.316
My observations up until
now have made that clear.

45:43.491 --> 45:44.491
Stop.

45:47.328 --> 45:49.284
You shouldn't
get too close to it.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.821
These spikes come out of it.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.456
So we don't know how safe
this thing really is, huh?

45:58.589 --> 45:59.589
Aoyama.

45:59.799 --> 46:01.835
Do you think you can help
me research the ocean?

46:03.636 --> 46:06.594
I'm rather busy, but...

46:07.515 --> 46:08.971
This is rather interesting.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.803
I thought you'd say that.

46:12.061 --> 46:13.221
Summer break

46:13.396 --> 46:14.636
"ocean" research

46:14.814 --> 46:16.679
commencing research

46:48.472 --> 46:49.678
Observation station

48:12.306 --> 48:14.513
I'l win a nobel prize

48:23.359 --> 48:25.145
Good job, young man.

48:26.445 --> 48:29.061
Aoyama! Aoyamal!

48:30.533 --> 48:31.864
Hey, aoyama!

48:32.034 --> 48:33.865
Summer festival

48:46.715 --> 48:48.376
Hey, aoyama.

48:48.717 --> 48:50.298
Hey, suzuki.

48:50.845 --> 48:53.177
You're not with hamamoto today?

48:53.347 --> 48:54.883
Doesn't look like
she's here yet.

48:56.183 --> 48:58.549
Right. You guys are
always together lately.

48:58.727 --> 49:00.183
What are you up to?

49:00.438 --> 49:04.397
Sorry, but that's confidential
between me and her.

49:04.608 --> 49:07.941
If you'd like me to tell you,
there's procedure I must follow.

49:08.487 --> 49:10.853
You're going off about
something again...

49:13.033 --> 49:14.694
You're just getting
all lovey-dovey

49:14.869 --> 49:15.869
with hamamoto, I bet.

49:15.953 --> 49:18.319
- Lovey-dovey!
- Lovey-dovey!

49:20.708 --> 49:21.948
That went better than expected.

49:22.084 --> 49:23.574
We're not lovey-dovey.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.168
Suzuki's a pain, huh?

49:29.341 --> 49:33.300
I'm sure it's because we're
getting close to hamamoto

49:33.471 --> 49:34.881
that he's mad.

49:35.139 --> 49:38.302
Why would suzuki get mad if
we got close to hamamoto?

49:38.559 --> 49:39.799
Why...

49:39.977 --> 49:43.765
That's because
suzuki likes hamamoto.

49:43.939 --> 49:48.023
That's weird.
Suzuki teases hamamoto.

49:48.235 --> 49:49.315
That's not logical.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.648
Yeah, but...

49:52.156 --> 49:54.147
I'm sure that's what's going on.

49:54.909 --> 49:56.365
Hello.

49:59.371 --> 50:01.828
Look. I'm wearing a yukata.
Does it look good on me?

50:04.376 --> 50:05.376
Hey.

50:05.544 --> 50:07.409
I think it looks good on you.

50:07.588 --> 50:08.588
Thank you.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.254
Dad.

50:11.675 --> 50:12.675
Dad?

50:13.511 --> 50:15.672
Aoyama and uchida.

50:17.890 --> 50:20.882
I've heard about you from
my daughter. Nice to meet you.

50:21.268 --> 50:24.226
My dad works
at a college research lab.

50:24.438 --> 50:25.894
But when he gets
too into something,

50:26.065 --> 50:27.705
all he does is eat candy
and get cavities.

50:27.900 --> 50:29.686
Hey, don't tell stories
about me.

50:29.902 --> 50:33.269
Aoyama and I are doing
some joint research.

50:33.614 --> 50:36.606
Oh, well that makes us rivals.

50:38.327 --> 50:39.487
Hello.

50:40.621 --> 50:42.532
It's been a while, young man.

50:43.457 --> 50:46.244
You're interested in this
summer festival, huh?

50:46.502 --> 50:48.038
Or are you
researching something?

50:48.671 --> 50:52.505
I'm taking a break tonight.
Actually, are you doing well?

50:53.092 --> 50:54.172
I'm just fine.

50:55.177 --> 50:56.462
Hello there.

50:56.679 --> 50:58.920
- Aoyama, who is that?
- Are you a relative?

50:59.098 --> 51:00.713
She's a lady from my dentist.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.722
She's also been
teaching me chess.

51:03.978 --> 51:05.013
Nice to meet you.

51:05.437 --> 51:08.600
This girl is hamamoto.
She's very good at chess.

51:09.441 --> 51:12.604
She's cute. You're good with
the ladies, young man.

51:12.778 --> 51:15.895
Aoyama and I are doing
joint research.

51:19.285 --> 51:22.277
That's why you're been
slacking on my research, huh?

51:22.746 --> 51:23.906
What research are you doing?

51:24.373 --> 51:26.364
It's classified.
We won't publish

51:26.542 --> 51:28.203
our results until we're done.

51:28.877 --> 51:30.208
That's good.

51:31.297 --> 51:35.506
You can't talk about any serious
research with just anyone.

51:37.511 --> 51:39.718
Aoyama, the bon dance is
going to start. Let's go.

51:39.888 --> 51:42.300
But I turn into a robot
when I dance.

51:44.768 --> 51:46.383
I'm going to dance!

51:50.524 --> 51:51.809
Everyone's having fun.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.270
Here you are.

51:54.903 --> 51:55.983
Thank you.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.166
It's done.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.063
We're going to check
the temperature

52:12.087 --> 52:13.087
in the ocean with this.

52:13.922 --> 52:16.163
We'll know it's position
with this penlight.

52:16.383 --> 52:19.045
This is cool.
It's like a real experiment.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.551
It kind of looks like a penguin.

52:21.722 --> 52:24.555
I was going more
for a research ship.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.851
Let's call it the penguin, then.

52:29.313 --> 52:30.313
That's a cute name.

52:35.194 --> 52:36.604
Let's do this.

52:36.779 --> 52:37.779
Yeah.

52:46.538 --> 52:48.403
We've made contact
with the ocean.

52:48.624 --> 52:50.740
It's shaking like jello.

52:52.836 --> 52:53.836
Uchida!

52:53.921 --> 52:56.788
Aoyama! I'm in trouble!
Real trouble!

53:05.724 --> 53:06.724
Huh?

53:11.689 --> 53:12.895
What's going on?

53:14.983 --> 53:16.314
Wait!

53:20.280 --> 53:21.986
The penguin disappeared.

53:23.117 --> 53:24.732
Looks like it was pulled in.

53:24.910 --> 53:26.992
Maybe we're dealing
with a life form.

53:28.956 --> 53:30.196
Charge!

53:38.340 --> 53:40.956
- What's that ball?
- It's floating!

53:41.135 --> 53:42.295
This is weird.

53:42.469 --> 53:43.800
Go!

53:59.319 --> 54:01.526
Hey, aoyama. Surrender.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.025
I won't surrender.

54:04.408 --> 54:05.818
Say you give up!

54:06.493 --> 54:07.824
I won't.

54:08.162 --> 54:10.574
Why are you guys here?

54:10.748 --> 54:14.332
You always head into the forest,
so we followed you.

54:14.960 --> 54:17.667
Hey hamamoto, what is this?

54:19.465 --> 54:20.921
This is the silver moon.

54:21.091 --> 54:23.298
You'll get sick
if you get too close.

54:25.429 --> 54:26.760
Fine, be like that.

54:26.930 --> 54:29.922
I'm not going
to fall for your lies anymore.

54:30.434 --> 54:31.640
You're planning something.

54:31.810 --> 54:33.516
If you don't tell me
what's going on,

54:33.729 --> 54:36.061
I'm going to tell everyone.

54:36.231 --> 54:37.346
Then just try it!

54:37.858 --> 54:39.018
If you do that...

54:39.359 --> 54:40.974
I'll never forgive you!

54:42.529 --> 54:43.769
I know why

54:43.989 --> 54:47.652
you're so angry, suzuki.

54:48.327 --> 54:49.327
What?

54:49.620 --> 54:52.362
If you like hamamoto,

54:52.539 --> 54:54.871
you should have just said that.

54:56.084 --> 54:58.166
That's not it!
What are you saying?

54:58.629 --> 55:00.665
We're not lovey-dovey.

55:01.089 --> 55:04.707
If you like her, you should tell
her in a more logical fashion.

55:04.885 --> 55:07.501
You don't know how I feel!

55:07.971 --> 55:10.212
It's not embarrassing

55:10.390 --> 55:12.631
to like someone.

55:12.810 --> 55:15.392
That's not it!
I'm going to get you!

55:16.104 --> 55:17.584
- Say you give up!
- You're too heavy!

55:17.731 --> 55:19.016
I won't say anything...

55:19.358 --> 55:20.768
You never give up!

55:21.026 --> 55:23.517
That's right, I don't!

55:44.842 --> 55:48.881
I'll send the penguins after you
if you do anything bad again.

55:52.516 --> 55:54.677
Hey there, young man.
Are you okay?

55:54.935 --> 55:57.301
I think you were
immature just now.

55:57.604 --> 55:58.964
I don't want to hear
that from you.

55:59.273 --> 56:00.763
But you've saved us.

56:07.865 --> 56:11.778
Looks like you've uncovered
something strange again.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.597
Something's happening!
Aoyama, let's get away!

56:40.898 --> 56:42.354
It's dangerous here!

57:03.545 --> 57:04.580
Uchida!

57:29.321 --> 57:31.653
Looks like I've gone
and done it now.

57:39.039 --> 57:40.959
You've known about this
for a while, haven't you?

57:42.584 --> 57:45.371
No fair! I told you
about the ocean.

57:45.545 --> 57:48.628
I wanted to know where the
penguins were coming from.

57:49.049 --> 57:52.382
I'm sorry.
I had to keep it a secret.

57:53.011 --> 57:56.344
I had promised her.
If other people found out,

57:56.515 --> 57:59.723
she might have been captured
by researchers, or something.

58:03.939 --> 58:05.850
You didn't trust me?

58:06.024 --> 58:07.264
That's not the case.

58:09.569 --> 58:10.684
Anyway, we now know that

58:11.029 --> 58:13.270
my penguin highway research,

58:13.573 --> 58:15.109
and our ocean research
are connected.

58:15.283 --> 58:16.302
Dad's advice:
Check to see if everything

58:16.326 --> 58:16.940
is part of one large problem.

58:17.119 --> 58:18.529
I realize I was in the wrong

58:19.037 --> 58:20.402
for keeping you both
in the dark.

58:20.789 --> 58:23.451
And there is one thing
I'd like to suggest.

58:24.376 --> 58:25.832
What do you think about having

58:26.003 --> 58:27.539
onee-San join us
in our research?

58:29.047 --> 58:32.084
We can't solve this mystery
operating separately.

58:32.259 --> 58:33.840
This is one single problem.

58:37.222 --> 58:40.714
No. I don't want adults
researching with us.

58:44.938 --> 58:47.054
That surprised me.

58:51.194 --> 58:54.812
This is our research.
Please do not come here anymore.

59:07.377 --> 59:10.084
Why is hamamoto so against this?

59:10.255 --> 59:13.543
I guess I went too far. Hmm?

59:24.936 --> 59:27.018
Things have gotten
pretty mysterious.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.892
You should be more careful.

59:30.067 --> 59:33.355
Yeah, but I don't really know
what's going on, either.

59:36.156 --> 59:37.942
I didn't think my penguins were

59:38.116 --> 59:40.152
even related to
what's going on here.

59:40.702 --> 59:43.444
So young man, what was that?

59:44.372 --> 59:46.158
We still don't know
what the ocean is.

59:46.333 --> 59:47.539
There's too many mysteries.

59:48.126 --> 59:51.334
What happened today was
completely abnormal.

59:51.505 --> 59:53.065
But there was
one thing in particular...

59:53.799 --> 59:55.359
There was an instant
where the ocean and

59:55.509 --> 59:56.949
the penguins reacted
with each other.

59:57.385 --> 59:59.125
When they were
all underneath it?

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.336
It's possible the source for the

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.301
penguin energy
might be the ocean.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.966
I bet the penguin
we had disappeared

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.135
because we were
too far from the ocean.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.015
You mean penta?

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.061
In other words, the penguins

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:15.601
came to this forest
in search of the ocean.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:19.650
But they're destroying
the ocean...

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.566
Huh? That doesn't make sense.

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:25.903
There's someone here.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.747
What are you doing here?

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:34.294
Oh, sorry. I got lost looking
for these two kids.

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.416
If you keep heading
along that path,

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:37.631
it'll get you out of here.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.459
This forest is dangerous.
You shouldn't be in here.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:41.637
No problem.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.182
Did you guys...

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:52.186
See anything strange
around here?

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.188
Um...

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:56.186
No, we didn't see anything.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.566
Let's go.

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:08.495
I wonder who they were...

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:10.914
I'm sure they're looking
for the ocean.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.370
They're going to find
out about you, too.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:15.664
Huh? Why's that?

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:17.332
You're involved in this.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.793
If they find
out you can manifest penguins...

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:22.408
You're going to get caught and
turned into a research subject.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.172
That won't happen.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:29.181
Adults wouldn't believe it.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.092
I don't think we can
be too careful.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.937
Also, even if something
like that were to happen...

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:37.440
I'll just go "poof" before
they try to experiment on me.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:39.354
No problem at all.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:45.320
Anyway, please don't manifest
penguins without good cause.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.796
- Brother, it's time for food!
- I'm coming!

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:04.050
One problem? Researchers?
Probably looking for the ocean?

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.837
Onee-San.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.095
Brother!

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:25.572
The past few days we've gotten
several eyewitness accounts

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.573
of this strange
unknown creature.

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:28.529
New species? Sudden mutation?

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:29.442
Is there a new
creature out there?

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:32.141
This is an illustration based on
the information we've received.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:34.698
According to a specialist,
in the history of biology...

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:35.876
That's scary...

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.659
I'm heading out.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:39.377
See you later.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:40.919
What's wrong?

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:43.123
They say a streetlight
disappeared this time.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.709
It was a vending machine
the other day, right?

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.796
Please don't get too close.

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:53.134
There's been a lot of
weird incidents lately.

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:57.179
Oh yeah, masuda's husband
saw that creature.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.605
Sounds dangerous.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.562
- Aoyama!
- Let's go to the forest!

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:02.225
Right.

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.044
I wonder if the children
will be okay...

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.564
Something...
Strange is happening...

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:12.277
I wonder if they
found the ocean.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:16.039
Hamamoto might be in the field.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.666
Let's find a different entrance.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.327
Aoyama, you know...

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:24.042
There's something
I want to tell you.

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.548
I've been continuing
project Amazon.

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:33.841
If you follow the stream,
you find its source, a river.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.556
I walked along its shore.

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:41.766
I was surprised when I did that.
I came back to the same stream.

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:43.277
Huh?

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:45.321
Basically...

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.906
There's no end to the river.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.363
It just circles around.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:55.699
Is that true?

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:56.613
Yeah.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.622
I walked along it a bunch
of times to be sure.

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:02.377
Aoyama, this is strange, right?

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.586
There's penguins here, too.

01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:13.213
Wait, uchida.

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.537
Aoyama...

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:45.119
It's entering a growth period.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:47.247
The largest thus far.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:52.048
Hamamoto, we need to talk.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.091
What is it?

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.013
The ocean might be too dangerous
for us to handle ourselves.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:00.969
What do you mean?

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:02.208
Disappearance of the penguin

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:03.813
the strange phenomena
that happened

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.348
that day were just so weird...

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:08.269
It might be difficult for us to
figure everything out ourselves.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:12.481
The things happening in town
are probably all related.

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:15.908
The adults are
searching for this.

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:19.784
If they find it,
I imagine we'll have to give

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:22.040
them all our research anyway.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:24.753
But...

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:29.623
I can't tell the researchers
about onee-San.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:32.674
That's why I'm thinking...

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:36.467
We need to stop
our research immediately.

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:40.843
We won't show what we've
researched so far to anyone.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.011
The relationship between
the ocean and penguins,

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.474
and the penguins and onee-San...

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.809
We'll just forget it all.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:48.938
I don't want to do this!
This is our research!

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.977
I don't want to leave it behind.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.561
The stuff with onee-San
won't get

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:53.979
found out unless
one of us talks!

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:57.242
You just want to protect her!

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:03.289
Don't fight, both of you.

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:08.040
You just like onee-San because
you like boobs, right?

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:09.917
I admit I do like boobs,

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.753
but my affection for onee-San
is separate.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:14.384
What are you talking about?

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.715
But onee-San has boobs,
doesn't she?

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:18.546
She does. Large ones.

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:19.972
I've had enough!

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:34.904
Hello.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:40.201
Oh, it's been a while.
Need us to look at you?

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:41.952
No, there's something else.

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:45.286
I'd like to talk to you a bit.

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:53.752
Is this a tornado?

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.758
It might look that way,

01:06:56.346 --> 01:07:00.385
but I research weather
at a university.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.424
These are the strange phenomena

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.760
we've been observing recently.

01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:05.594
This town is experiencing

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:09.480
strange incidents that
we cannot explain.

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:10.898
I see...

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:14.903
I just happened to look
at my daughter's notes.

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:17.522
There's information about
a strange object

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.565
deep in the forest,
and about the penguins.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:20.827
And...

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:22.694
Information about you.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:23.872
Huh?

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.082
I realize I'm being
rather presumptive here.

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:30.118
However, my daughter
might be young,

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.786
but she's a proper researcher.

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.292
What she wrote
started bugging me...

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.425
I thought about asking
her directly,

01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:40.086
but I didn't want to bring
her into this.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:43.469
I would be happy if I could
get your cooperation.

01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:53.812
Hello.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:55.731
Hello.

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:56.947
Researching?

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.612
Yes, what about you?

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:01.108
Getting my cavities
taken care of.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.197
You shouldn't eat
too many sweets.

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:06.158
Be careful not
to get any cavities.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:16.756
Oh, hey there, young man.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:19.626
- Um...
- Hey.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:23.761
Want to go to that seaside
town tomorrow?

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:33.180
Hey, young man.

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:39.107
First time going
to the ocean, right?

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:41.481
Yeah.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.617
I wonder how many years

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.068
it'll have been since
I was home.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:50.832
What's wrong, young man?
You seem down.

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:54.872
I'm always doing well.
How about you?

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:57.247
I've been feeling pretty good,
I guess.

01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:59.416
I want to let out some penguins,
though.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:02.377
I've been holding back,
as you asked.

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:05.721
I see. It makes sense if you're

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:09.009
the source for
the penguin energy.

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:11.595
If it was the ocean,
then it wouldn't

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:14.014
make sense for the penguins
to destroy it.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.227
You know...

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:22.359
There were a lot of adults at
the entrance to the forest.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:25.317
At this rate, the ocean,
the penguins,

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:27.326
and you will be found out.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.657
And...

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.497
You're sure worried about a lot.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:35.001
I haven't solved your mystery...

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:38.334
So are you sure you want to
take me to the seaside town?

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:41.090
That's what you're thinking?

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:44.381
It's fine. I'm the one
who wants to go.

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:49.258
Once we get there,
let's forget about everything,

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:52.596
okay?

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:57.061
It's summer break, young man.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.231
Okay...

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.240
Hey.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.319
Are you okay?

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.742
I'm a little dizzy...

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:21.126
We shouldn't
go to the beach today.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.962
Why? All I need
is to rest a little.

01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:27.632
You shouldn't push yourself.
Let's call it a day.

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:33.266
Hold on, young man.

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:47.732
I was fine
this morning. I'm sorry.

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:48.994
It's fine.

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:53.412
You're sure a gentleman.
Children should be more selfish.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.080
I'm not a child.

01:10:57.044 --> 01:11:00.787
Sure you are.
Let's try again tomorrow.

01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:03.213
It doesn't have to be tomorrow.

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:07.294
You shouldn't move!

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:13.758
Are you okay?

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:44.375
What's going on...

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:55.349
The jabberwockies...

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.427
Jabberwockies...

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:13.451
I'm fine now. It's okay.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:15.903
I have emergency rations.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.407
You need to eat something.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.832
Sorry, I can't. I...

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.250
I haven't eaten anything
for two to three days.

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:31.635
I'm just not hungry.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:34.630
But it isn't affecting
me at all.

01:12:34.809 --> 01:12:37.346
I wonder what's going
on with me...

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:50.738
Summer break's gonna
come to an end.

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:54.446
No matter how much fun you have,
it eventually comes to an end.

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:56.452
That's the truth.

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:04.164
What kind of present
do you want?

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:06.287
A notebook from
a foreign country.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.418
Okay, I'll get one.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.083
Is that research
of yours going well?

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:13.089
It's really difficult.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:15.554
There's lots of problems,

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.182
and it feels like they're
all connected.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:19.811
But...

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:22.846
But right now
I don't know anything else.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:25.390
Oh, you sound
like you've lost faith.

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:32.064
The mysteries you find,
the small discoveries you make,

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.448
write them all down on
a single piece of paper.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:37.193
And keep staring at it.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:38.736
Will that tell me the answer?

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:40.821
Think about different
ways of pairing

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.206
up everything you wrote down.

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:45.830
Envision them all flying
around in your mind.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.038
If that doesn't help,

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.707
try to stop thinking.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:53.929
Huh?

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:57.927
Play well, eat well, sleep well.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:01.892
If you do, all the things in
your head that are separate

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:04.019
will suddenly connect.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:06.097
"Eureka", they call it.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:09.235
Don't worry.

01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:21.077
Good morning!

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:23.830
Hey there! You're so tanned!
=I went to the beach!

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:26.955
Well? You've never seen
anything like this, right?

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:29.586
- It's a new species!
- A new species! A new species!

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:31.334
Amazing, huh?

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:33.009
What's going on?

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:36.586
Suzuki and his gang said they
caught a weird creature.

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:39.096
I went adventuring
in that forest!

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:42.342
And I found it in the river!
So then we...

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:44.643
Aoyama, is that...

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:46.854
A jabberwocky.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:48.560
Hold it right there!

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:50.975
You don't get to see it!

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:53.065
This is our find!

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:57.235
It's top secret!

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:01.535
Everybody,
did you solve the problem?

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:03.738
Okay, the rest is homework.

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:07.585
Okay.

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:11.170
There's a typhoon tonight,
so head straight home.

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.960
I hope the people who
fell asleep will be okay...

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:15.341
Excuse me for a second.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:16.553
Sure...

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.556
Suzuki, kobayashi, Nagasaki.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:26.977
All three of you,
come to the staff room.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.813
There's scientists who
want to talk to you.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.191
Scientists?

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.147
Aww, jeez...

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.280
Sure thing!

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:37.271
We're gonna be famous!

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:40.608
Wait, suzuki.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.781
You remember our promise, right?

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.783
What? We're just going to
tell them what we found.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:53.584
What is this promise?

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:55.460
Are they from the university?

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.840
Bye-bye! See you later!

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:05.679
Suzuki never came back, huh?

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.603
I'm closing the door.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:23.533
That's the guy from before!

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.202
They went towards the forest.

01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:26.372
Let's go!

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:29.073
Aoyama?

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:33.578
I'm sorry. I have someplace
to go first. I'll catch up!

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:36.216
Wait!

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:40.042
Jeez! Forget you!

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:51.144
It's me! Aoyama!

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.652
Please eat this - aoyama

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:00.824
I knew it.

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:15.707
Here, too!

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.293
There they are!

01:17:27.685 --> 01:17:29.266
- And this...
- Daddy!

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:32.640
What's going on here?

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:35.932
What are you doing here?
Go home!

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:42.609
No! We want
to go inside the forest!

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:46.032
No! Go home, now!

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:52.073
Man, it was a huge surprise!

01:17:52.293 --> 01:17:54.830
It's the discovery
of the century!

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:57.370
Why are they here?

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:01.920
They told us about the forest.

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:04.426
So they've been asked
to help... hey!

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.475
I'll never forgive you, ever!

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:19.225
What's your problem?

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:22.110
- I'll never forgive you!
- Stop it!

01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:26.111
- I'll never forgive you!
- Hey!

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:38.334
Oh?

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:43.882
You're finally back!
I told you to come home early!

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:47.420
Mom, I'm about
to experiment with fasting.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.299
Huh?

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:49.763
For the next three days,

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:52.137
I'm not going to eat.

01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:57.639
As your mother, I'm opposed
to this experiment.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:59.727
I'll eat three times
as much when I'm done!

01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:02.226
Wait! Hey!

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:07.114
Research lab

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:12.028
q: How can onee-San fast for
three days and be fine?

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:15.323
Do people not have to eat?
> I'll experiment myself.

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:32.555
The penguins are born
from onee-San.

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:33.306
Many things transform into them.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.282
The penguins survive
off of penguin energy.

01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:36.762
Does the ocean warp spacetime?

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:37.560
When onee-San is feeling good,

01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:38.390
she wants to make penguins.

01:19:38.565 --> 01:19:39.885
The jabberwocky
eats the penguins.

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:50.190
Brother, it's dinner time!

01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:51.575
I'm not eating!

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:53.360
You're so stubborn.

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.085
Ocean size changes rain... clear

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:13.598
Use a1 to 5s scale to
describe my hunger level?

01:20:57.102 --> 01:20:59.559
Doctor, it's dangerous!
We have to get back!

01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:01.140
Just a little further!

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.690
What is this?

01:21:56.537 --> 01:21:57.537
What's wrong?

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:00.571
Mom... mom's gonna die!

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.201
Where is she?

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:04.752
Ow...

01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:12.375
What's going on?

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.805
That's going to happen a long
time from now, isn't it?

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:27.525
Yeah.

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:30.317
But... she's
going to die, right?

01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:32.728
Well, yeah, but...

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:34.442
Why?

01:22:34.825 --> 01:22:36.816
All living things
die eventually.

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:38.404
Even dogs and penguins...

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:39.947
And humans.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.370
But I don't want that!

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:47.000
Don't say that...

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:49.666
I don't like it either.

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:06.888
See? You should've
listened to your mom.

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:10.065
Stay home from school.

01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:12.601
And your experiment's
canceled, okay?

01:23:12.946 --> 01:23:14.061
Il don't want to eat...

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:17.147
Eat anyway. I'll make you some
porridge, just wait a second.

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:29.375
The fast was a failure.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:32.128
Humans suffer if they try to
skip even one day's food.

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.841
How did onee-San go three days
without eating?

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:49.813
I came to an unknown planet.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.478
That's my spaceship.

01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:56.733
It's a very mysterious place!

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:58.525
Is there anybody here?

01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:03.531
That's a blue whale,
and there are penguins too.

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.617
It's so big...

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.782
Way bigger than me.

01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:11.035
The penguins!

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:14.747
Onee-San?

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:17.840
What's she doing here?

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:21.174
I've always been here.
This is the earth.

01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:24.715
That's strange...
I came a long way.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:29.429
If you go far enough,
you return to where you started.

01:24:30.107 --> 01:24:32.940
Huh? What...

01:24:37.114 --> 01:24:38.570
Onee-San!

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:50.658
Onee-San...

01:24:56.341 --> 01:24:59.299
I feel sorry for you.
You must feel awful.

01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:08.012
Onee-San...

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:10.761
I'm doing fine,
but you're bedridden.

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.554
That doesn't happen too often.

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:14.806
What are you doing here?

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:16.444
I came to see you.

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:19.231
The research team
found the ocean.

01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.988
You can't make any penguins.

01:25:22.326 --> 01:25:23.691
Don't worry about me.

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:25.985
Make sure you're
eating properly.

01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:29.199
And eat something too, please.

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:35.873
I tried doing an experiment
on myself, for a week.

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:37.879
I haven't eaten anything.

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.340
You can't do any experiments
like that.

01:25:44.514 --> 01:25:46.425
They'll make your
breasts smaller.

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:52.685
I'm fine because I have
the penguin energy.

01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:56.223
That's not energy for humans.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.441
I'm sorry.

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:05.072
Don't cry, young man.

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.033
I'm not crying.

01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:15.913
How to achieve Eureka

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.760
Good morning.

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:47.778
Bye!

01:26:48.245 --> 01:26:50.987
Brother! I'm leaving
without you!

01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:53.078
I'll be back later.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:27.864
Can you solve this mystery?

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:39.166
Eureka...

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:50.928
Aoyama, you're over
your cold, huh?

01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:52.141
Yeah.

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:54.595
Aoyama, what are you doing?

01:27:54.895 --> 01:27:55.895
Yeah.

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:04.518
It was so small!

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.444
And guess what happened then!

01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:08.822
They just said something
in the office!

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:10.114
Put the TV on!

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:11.565
You need to
get permission first!

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:12.620
It's an emergency!

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:14.744
An evacuation order
was just issued.

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:16.853
According to news
we've just received,

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.036
the unknown sphere
continues to expand...

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:20.211
That's near the gym!

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:23.374
Several researchers
were caught up in it.

01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:24.287
=that's bad!

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:26.486
- What is that? It's scary.
- The missing researchers...

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:28.171
Belong to a local college,

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:31.837
and were investigating unusual
phenomena at the site.

01:28:32.182 --> 01:28:34.423
Everyone, this school will be

01:28:34.601 --> 01:28:37.263
evacuated due
to a nearby disaster.

01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:42.188
Please remain in your classroom
until further instructions.

01:28:42.609 --> 01:28:45.225
Hey, you're not allowed
to turn on the TV!

01:28:45.403 --> 01:28:48.486
- It's an emergency, though!
- Quiet.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:51.194
Turn that off and go sit down.

01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:52.653
Tell us what happened!

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:55.284
They're investigating it now.

01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:57.616
Oh wow! This is kind of exciting!

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:01.499
Ma'am, my dad...

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:05.458
Yeah, I know. I'm worried
too, but wait here for now.

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.129
Let me go, please!

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:09.921
You can't leave the
school! It's dangerous!

01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:14.134
I know it's hard, but I'm sure
he'll be back! Don't worry!

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:16.055
Hamamoto!

01:29:16.226 --> 01:29:17.226
Hey!

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:19.055
- Get back to your seat!
- Let me go!

01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:24.140
Calm down, everyone! It'll
be fine. Just wait a second.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:29.356
Hamamoto, are you okay?

01:29:29.573 --> 01:29:30.733
What happened?

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:34.399
You heard, right?
The ocean swallowed up my dad.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:38.995
I'm sure he got too
focused on his research,

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:39.950
and...

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:43.538
The ocean is dangerous.
=I know that!

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:47.295
Is my dad gonna die?

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:51.125
The penguin ship
never came back...

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:56.297
If I'd only told them the
ocean was dangerous...

01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:59.216
This never would've happened!

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.930
Right?

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:06.940
Hey, what do I do?

01:30:09.362 --> 01:30:12.946
All I know is what I should do.

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:15.274
Aoyama, sit down.

01:30:15.744 --> 01:30:17.780
Aoyama, please...

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:24.203
Ma'am, hamamoto
isn't feeling well.

01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:26.097
I'm going to take her
to the nurse's office.

01:30:32.135 --> 01:30:33.466
We can't leave
out the front door.

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:35.836
Hey, aoyama, what do we do?

01:30:36.139 --> 01:30:37.174
Hamamoto,

01:30:37.515 --> 01:30:38.925
calm down and listen to me.

01:30:39.309 --> 01:30:43.018
We need onee-San's
help to save your dad.

01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:47.188
Her penguins might be able to
do something about the ocean.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:50.563
But won't they destroy it?

01:30:50.737 --> 01:30:52.147
Maybe.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:55.610
But hamamoto, for now,
I want you to believe me.

01:30:55.992 --> 01:30:56.992
Aoyama.

01:30:57.744 --> 01:30:59.234
I'll go with you!

01:30:59.579 --> 01:31:00.579
Uchida...

01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:01.664
Hey!

01:31:04.834 --> 01:31:06.199
Now what?

01:31:06.962 --> 01:31:09.544
If you're leaving school,
we'll help.

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:10.328
Huh?

01:31:10.715 --> 01:31:14.549
So... will you forgive me,
hamamoto?

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:17.006
I don't know.

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:21.051
Thank you. Please help.

01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:25.560
There's a secret way out.
Follow me!

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:35.155
Hey!

01:31:35.365 --> 01:31:37.526
Hey, you! Get back here!

01:31:37.701 --> 01:31:38.816
Oh no, hurry!

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:39.994
Hamamoto!

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:44.832
Are you okay?

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:46.448
Oh, no!

01:31:47.877 --> 01:31:49.287
This way!

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:54.956
Hey, what is that?

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.712
Wow!

01:31:58.138 --> 01:31:59.298
=lt's the ocean!

01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:01.929
Is that what you
were researching?

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:04.098
Hey, what are you doing?

01:32:04.269 --> 01:32:05.304
You need to evacuate!

01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:09.729
Everybody, run!

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:16.106
Hold it!

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:18.689
No!

01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:20.357
Let me go!

01:32:21.995 --> 01:32:23.405
Take this!

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:33.123
Run, aoyama!

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:05.701
It seems the mystery's
been solved.

01:33:06.206 --> 01:33:07.206
Yes.

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:11.958
Just like the penguins
aren't real penguins,

01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:13.712
you're...

01:33:13.963 --> 01:33:15.169
Not a real human.

01:33:15.757 --> 01:33:16.757
Yeah.

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:21.589
You, the penguins, and the
ocean were all linked.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.559
It seems to have been fueling
both you and the penguins.

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:32.224
The penguin energy, right?

01:33:32.398 --> 01:33:33.398
That's right.

01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:37.058
Since the penguins
can destroy the ocean,

01:33:37.237 --> 01:33:39.569
I assume that's a particularly
important characteristic.

01:33:40.865 --> 01:33:42.355
Darn, we need to hide!

01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:43.534
This isn't good.

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:54.128
Ow.

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:57.579
So, young man...

01:33:58.341 --> 01:33:59.877
What's the ocean?

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:04.378
The ocean warps
both space and time.

01:34:05.098 --> 01:34:07.259
That's why I hypothesize that

01:34:07.433 --> 01:34:09.890
it should not exist
in this world.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:12.844
And if that's true,

01:34:13.022 --> 01:34:15.729
and the ocean
isn't a physical object,

01:34:16.067 --> 01:34:17.898
if it's a hole...

01:34:18.194 --> 01:34:19.229
A hole?

01:34:19.529 --> 01:34:21.019
A hole in the world.

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:24.614
Or maybe it's
the edge of the world,

01:34:24.909 --> 01:34:26.615
that's folded
in on itself somehow.

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:27.908
You're kidding...

01:34:28.079 --> 01:34:30.570
The penguins weren't
destroying the ocean.

01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:32.785
They were repairing the world.

01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.242
So I create the penguins
in order

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.331
to plug that hole in the world?

01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:39.875
It's a hypothesis, but
it explains everything.

01:34:41.384 --> 01:34:42.624
Great...

01:34:42.802 --> 01:34:44.713
- Okay, we're heading back.
- Yes, sir.

01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:49.134
Looks like they're gone.

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.931
But you...

01:34:51.769 --> 01:34:54.010
You create the penguins,
which repair it,

01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:56.225
but you also create
the jabberwockies.

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:59.349
The jabberwockies
eat the penguins...

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:02.690
This goes against your role.

01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:04.354
Maybe they were created

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:07.990
because I asked you not to
make any more penguins!

01:35:08.161 --> 01:35:09.161
No, young man.

01:35:09.829 --> 01:35:11.660
It's not your fault.

01:35:12.248 --> 01:35:14.204
I would have created
the penguins

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:15.706
no matter what you said.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.439
Instead, I was the one
who decided to sit

01:35:18.463 --> 01:35:19.543
around and not do anything.

01:35:20.298 --> 01:35:21.913
I don't know how to put it...

01:35:23.843 --> 01:35:27.427
I guess I wanted
to stay in this world.

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:33.508
Thank you for coming up
with all of that, young man.

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:38.472
Well, it's gotten pretty big.

01:35:39.317 --> 01:35:42.229
I hope Dr. hamamoto
and the others are okay.

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:45.987
We sent the penguin ship inside,
but it never came back.

01:35:46.241 --> 01:35:47.241
What's that?

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:49.657
It's a research vessel we made.

01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:54.996
If the world really does have
some kind of "edge"

01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:57.907
it may be floating out
there somewhere.

01:35:59.337 --> 01:36:01.669
Guess we'll just try
heading into it.

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:13.093
Aoyama, it's dangerous from
here on out. You wait here.

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:16.471
What about them?

01:36:16.813 --> 01:36:20.101
No, I can't let you go alone.

01:36:20.733 --> 01:36:23.816
I'm going too!
Even if you try to stop me!

01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:26.986
You're just a kid, silly.

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:28.988
You need to evacuate!

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:33.693
But it'll probably be okay.
We've got the penguins.

01:36:34.956 --> 01:36:38.699
Alright! Let's go, everyone!

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:46.581
Hey!

01:36:49.512 --> 01:36:50.512
Stop!

01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:07.693
You can be the ringmaster
at a penguin circus!

01:37:07.864 --> 01:37:10.947
That sounds wonderful!
I should have tried that out!

01:37:32.722 --> 01:37:34.758
The whole world
is turning weird!

01:37:34.932 --> 01:37:35.932
Well, this is crazy!

01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:41.473
How pretty!

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:51.813
There's more and more of them!

01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:53.322
There's so many!

01:38:06.798 --> 01:38:08.334
It's the ocean!

01:38:10.593 --> 01:38:12.754
We're going to crash into it!

01:38:48.631 --> 01:38:50.246
We're inside the ocean?

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:07.555
It seems we're still alive...

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:10.604
I wonder where Dr. hamamoto is.

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:13.562
Oh, penguins...

01:39:13.739 --> 01:39:14.819
Take us there.

01:39:29.172 --> 01:39:32.084
We really have gone beyond
the edge of the world.

01:39:32.758 --> 01:39:33.758
Yes.

01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:35.063
Take a look.

01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:53.661
It's like god is having fun.

01:41:01.639 --> 01:41:05.302
I wonder why I have
memories of the seaside town...

01:41:07.144 --> 01:41:09.977
I remember my mom and dad.

01:41:10.731 --> 01:41:13.939
I have memories of me
living up until this point.

01:41:14.819 --> 01:41:16.980
Was all of that fake?

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:20.821
I don't know.

01:41:22.201 --> 01:41:25.489
But I have the memories
of my time with you.

01:41:26.622 --> 01:41:28.533
Those are definitely real.

01:41:28.958 --> 01:41:29.993
You're right.

01:41:41.429 --> 01:41:45.547
I wonder if the penguins are
waiting to destroy the ocean.

01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:48.137
Maybe.

01:41:49.812 --> 01:41:50.972
Hey, aoyama...

01:41:51.147 --> 01:41:54.184
Will I disappear
if the ocean is gone?

01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:59.110
If my hypothesis is right,
the penguins will disappear.

01:41:59.697 --> 01:42:00.697
What about me?

01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:06.033
So that's your answer, then...

01:42:06.829 --> 01:42:09.946
It's quite possible
that I'm wrong as well.

01:42:18.466 --> 01:42:19.466
Hey!

01:42:20.009 --> 01:42:22.716
Aoyama, what are you doing here?

01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:26.296
We came to rescue you all.

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.805
It's about time.

01:42:42.865 --> 01:42:47.074
Is it possible for you to leave
a little bit of the ocean?

01:42:47.286 --> 01:42:48.286
Why?

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:52.196
If a little is left,
the penguin energy will remain.

01:42:52.625 --> 01:42:54.536
You'll be able
to remain in full health.

01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:57.911
I'm not sure if it
works like that.

01:42:58.589 --> 01:43:02.047
But young man, we can't leave
things as they are, right?

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.926
Yeah...

01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:12.727
There we go!

01:43:13.729 --> 01:43:16.141
Well, it's time to return home!

01:44:35.603 --> 01:44:37.719
What's happening?

01:44:38.439 --> 01:44:40.145
I don't know.

01:44:41.859 --> 01:44:45.443
You do know, don't you?

01:44:46.447 --> 01:44:48.529
Maybe I do.

01:44:49.074 --> 01:44:52.157
But this research
is very important to me.

01:44:52.995 --> 01:44:55.862
I won't tell anyone its secrets.

01:45:02.505 --> 01:45:03.505
Young man.

01:45:05.591 --> 01:45:07.297
Let's go.

01:45:14.225 --> 01:45:16.762
Hey, that's dangerous!
Stay here!

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.932
We have something
important to do!

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:23.059
Goodbye, doctor!

01:46:00.312 --> 01:46:01.677
Want sugar?

01:46:01.856 --> 01:46:02.891
No.

01:46:03.566 --> 01:46:04.976
It's bitter.

01:46:05.609 --> 01:46:06.609
I'm fine.

01:46:18.873 --> 01:46:21.580
Young man, it seems
I wasn't able

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:23.706
to keep any of the ocean.

01:46:24.086 --> 01:46:25.417
Yeah.

01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:31.791
Why do you think I was born?

01:46:32.344 --> 01:46:33.550
I don't know.

01:46:33.721 --> 01:46:37.555
But someday I might know.

01:46:40.436 --> 01:46:43.348
Will you tell me
when you find out?

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:45.596
I will.

01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:49.271
Is it bitter?

01:46:49.904 --> 01:46:52.020
It's not.

01:46:52.197 --> 01:46:53.477
You're always
pushing yourself...

01:47:13.969 --> 01:47:16.301
I'm not a human...

01:47:17.139 --> 01:47:18.754
I can't believe that.

01:47:19.558 --> 01:47:24.143
I wanted to see you grow up
into a proper adult.

01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:27.555
You're going
to be amazing, I bet.

01:47:28.484 --> 01:47:29.724
Yes.

01:47:30.194 --> 01:47:32.230
I'm going to be
a great grown-up.

01:47:33.072 --> 01:47:35.028
I'll be much greater
than I am now.

01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:37.281
And I'll be humanity's
representative.

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:38.695
I'll go to space, too.

01:47:38.994 --> 01:47:40.985
I'm sure you'll be able to solve

01:47:41.163 --> 01:47:43.199
my mysteries
if you're that great.

01:47:43.916 --> 01:47:47.659
I want you to come and find me.

01:47:48.087 --> 01:47:50.169
I'll find you.

01:47:53.258 --> 01:47:57.877
Sleeping, DNA,
happiness, perfection

01:47:59.598 --> 01:48:02.305
it's almost time to say goodbye.

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:11.765
You stay here.

01:48:14.029 --> 01:48:15.269
Don't cry, young man.

01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:18.072
I won't cry.

01:49:04.329 --> 01:49:06.490
It's okay. Right?

01:49:13.338 --> 01:49:14.953
Aoyama!

01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:23.466
Hey, where is she?

01:49:23.682 --> 01:49:26.139
Onee-San left.

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:29.726
Aoyama... are you crying?

01:49:30.439 --> 01:49:33.351
I've decided not to cry.

01:49:41.575 --> 01:49:44.191
The mysterious sphere
that appeared at a town

01:49:44.369 --> 01:49:47.076
on the prefecture border
yesterday has disappeared

01:49:47.206 --> 01:49:48.912
and now, this morning,

01:49:49.124 --> 01:49:52.241
the evacuation order for the
region has been rescinded,

01:49:52.544 --> 01:49:55.331
and the people
are returning to the town.

01:49:55.923 --> 01:49:58.960
This incident
was nationwide news,

01:49:59.134 --> 01:50:02.001
but fortunately,
no one was hurt.

01:50:02.387 --> 01:50:05.049
And the local college
researchers who

01:50:05.224 --> 01:50:07.806
were missing have been
found as well.

01:50:09.603 --> 01:50:13.437
The penguins that had been
appearing in the city

01:50:13.607 --> 01:50:17.441
were witnessed
in large numbers yesterday,

01:50:17.694 --> 01:50:19.559
and some specialists
feel that they may

01:50:19.738 --> 01:50:21.694
have been a signal
of the event to come...

01:50:22.116 --> 01:50:23.116
Others, however,

01:50:23.242 --> 01:50:26.405
believe that it may have been
a mass hallucination...

01:50:45.222 --> 01:50:50.012
There are 3,748 days until
I grow up to be an adult.

01:50:51.019 --> 01:50:52.975
Brother, time for food!

01:50:53.147 --> 01:50:56.264
Every day,
I learn about the world.

01:50:56.608 --> 01:50:58.644
And become better
than I was yesterday.

01:51:00.529 --> 01:51:02.861
I can't imagine how amazing
I'll eventually be.

01:51:05.159 --> 01:51:08.868
I'm sure I'll have lots of girls
who will want to marry me.

01:51:11.039 --> 01:51:14.406
But I already have
someone for me.

01:51:15.085 --> 01:51:17.667
So I won't be able
to marry them.

01:51:22.050 --> 01:51:25.668
It may be a sad thing,
to see the edge of the world.

01:51:27.514 --> 01:51:30.927
But even so,
I intend to run very fast

01:51:31.226 --> 01:51:33.182
towards it anyway.

01:51:34.271 --> 01:51:38.981
Because I know that path
will be a penguin highway.

01:51:39.568 --> 01:51:41.308
I believe that if I follow it

01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:45.646
someday I'll see onee-San again.

01:51:47.409 --> 01:51:48.694
This isn't a hypothesis.

01:51:48.869 --> 01:51:51.485
It's a personal belief.

01:51:55.667 --> 01:51:58.875
This time, she and I
will ride on the train,

01:51:59.046 --> 01:52:00.707
and travel to that
town by the sea.

01:52:01.715 --> 01:52:05.549
When that happens, there's
some things I want to tell her:

01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:10.758
How many adventures I'll
have had in my life,

01:52:11.016 --> 01:52:13.382
and how many people I've met.

01:52:14.645 --> 01:52:17.057
And how much of a grown-up

01:52:17.397 --> 01:52:19.604
I've become by the time
I see her again.

01:52:21.485 --> 01:52:24.443
Project penguin highway

01:52:26.531 --> 01:52:28.647
and how much

01:52:29.034 --> 01:52:31.525
I loved her.

01:52:33.497 --> 01:52:37.456
And how much I've longed
to see her again.

01:52:57.312 --> 01:52:58.677
What's going on?

01:53:29.136 --> 01:53:37.136
The risen dust dances merrily

01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:47.229
a photo album I hadn't
opened in a long time

01:53:48.905 --> 01:53:56.905
hello, the world that
you were seeing

01:53:58.707 --> 01:54:06.707
mystery solving never ends

01:54:12.929 --> 01:54:18.970
Goodbye

01:54:19.186 --> 01:54:21.848
goodbye

01:54:22.939 --> 01:54:28.980
goodbye

01:54:29.279 --> 01:54:31.941
goodbye

01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:38.990
goodbye

01:54:39.206 --> 01:54:41.868
goodbye

01:54:42.834 --> 01:54:48.875
goodbye

01:54:49.216 --> 01:54:54.051
good night

01:54:54.805 --> 01:55:02.805
you close your eyes
so unguardedly

01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:12.189
yet never invite anyone
into your dreams

01:55:13.865 --> 01:55:21.865
hello, I am not a distant memory

01:55:23.875 --> 01:55:31.875
goodbyes, I hate them

01:55:37.931 --> 01:55:41.844
Goodbye

01:55:47.899 --> 01:55:55.899
Goodbye

01:55:57.909 --> 01:56:01.948
goodbye

01:56:07.919 --> 01:56:13.915
Goodbye

01:56:14.176 --> 01:56:16.792
goodbye

01:56:17.888 --> 01:56:23.884
goodbye

01:56:24.227 --> 01:56:26.843
goodbye

01:56:27.898 --> 01:56:33.894
goodbye

01:56:34.154 --> 01:56:36.770
goodbye

01:56:38.033 --> 01:56:44.029
goodbye

01:56:44.247 --> 01:56:46.863
goodbye

01:56:47.959 --> 01:56:53.955
goodbye

01:56:54.174 --> 01:56:59.919
good night

01:57:07.812 --> 01:57:12.397
Won't you let me tell you
how I'm doing lately

01:57:12.817 --> 01:57:14.899
how I'm doing lately

01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:18.562
how I'm doing lately
