[girls laughing]

00:35.502 --> 00:36.935
[exclaiming]

00:37.037 --> 00:40.131
See the tall one
with braces? That's Amanda.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.600
I'd give anything to be a flannel nightgown
at that sleepover.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.268
It'll never happen.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.703
But I do have an unobstructed view...

00:47.814 --> 00:51.215
of hot girl-on-girl pillow-fight action
from my bedroom window.

00:51.317 --> 00:54.980
Not as good as the view from my roof
with my dad's thermal goggles.

00:55.088 --> 00:57.420
I'll be able to see their body heat....

00:57.524 --> 00:58.752
[exclaiming]

00:58.858 --> 01:00.018
Later, Bobby.

01:02.929 --> 01:07.161
Lights out at 9:30.
After that, no laughing, no singing.

01:07.267 --> 01:10.896
-No flashlights, no ghost stories.
-No nothing, except sleep!

01:11.471 --> 01:13.336
Also, you have to sign this.

01:14.841 --> 01:16.968
(Kahn) It says that we are not responsible...

01:17.077 --> 01:19.841
for any injury
that might occur during sleepover.

01:25.051 --> 01:27.349
Susan Clemmons, is it?

01:27.787 --> 01:29.482
You forgot to initial here!

01:31.991 --> 01:34.983
Okay. Enjoy sleepover.

[music blariig oi stereo]

[girls laughing]

01:43.002 --> 01:44.799
Dang! Show's over!

01:44.904 --> 01:49.102
What are you doing? What part
of the contract didn't you understand?

01:49.342 --> 01:50.969
Give me the pillows!

01:51.711 --> 01:55.647
(Bobby) That's it, Susan. Hide the pillow.
Good girl.

01:55.748 --> 01:58.308
Come on, cough it up!

02:02.155 --> 02:03.315
[girls sighing]

02:04.157 --> 02:06.148
You're not gonna sleep now, are you?

02:06.259 --> 02:09.922
I'd leave now, but I already paid your dad
for the continental breakfast.

02:10.029 --> 02:11.155
(girl) Yeah.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.300
[whispering] Bobby!

02:15.401 --> 02:17.733
Honest, Connie. I--I wasn't watching.

02:17.837 --> 02:20.135
Bobby, my party's dying.
Can you come over?

02:20.240 --> 02:21.298
Yes!

02:21.407 --> 02:22.601
[crickets chirping]

02:26.146 --> 02:27.773
[groaning]

02:27.881 --> 02:28.870
[girls laughing]

02:28.982 --> 02:31.348
Bobby! Take it off!

02:32.152 --> 02:33.210
[music playiig oi stereo]

02:33.319 --> 02:35.253
Give the girls what they paid for.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.389
Oh, my God!

02:37.490 --> 02:39.924
If cupid had a heart,
He would make you fall

02:40.026 --> 02:41.118
[grunting]

02:41.227 --> 02:43.218
You'll fall ii love with me

02:43.329 --> 02:45.559
Ii io time at all

02:45.665 --> 02:47.223
If cupid had a heart

02:47.333 --> 02:50.302
Shake it, baby. Give me some motion.

02:50.403 --> 02:51.461
Oh, yeah!

02:51.871 --> 02:53.566
She's got nice ones!

02:53.673 --> 02:55.436
If cupid had a heart

02:55.542 --> 02:57.305
(Kahn) What are you doing?

02:57.410 --> 03:01.813
This is a sleepover,
not a play-music-loud-all-night-over!

03:05.185 --> 03:07.517
What's Chang Wassanasong doing here?

03:07.620 --> 03:11.283
I might have told him
you were having a sleepover.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.958
-What's up, ladies?
-Beat it, Wassanasong!

03:17.030 --> 03:19.590
Check it out. It's ""Booby"" Hill.

03:19.732 --> 03:23.691
When God was passing out wit,
you thought he said zit...

03:23.803 --> 03:25.430
and you asked for seconds.

03:25.538 --> 03:28.735
-Now, out the window!
-We're not going anywhere.

03:28.841 --> 03:32.299
-We came for a pillow fight.
-Connie's dad took them all.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.510
Then how about just fight?

03:35.615 --> 03:36.639
[groaning]

03:36.749 --> 03:37.807
What was that? What....

03:37.917 --> 03:38.884
[Kahn screaming]

03:38.985 --> 03:41.249
No boys in slumber party!

03:41.788 --> 03:43.756
Oh, hey, Chang.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.049
How you doing? How's your dad?

03:47.260 --> 03:50.058
Still on membership committee
at Nine River Country Club?

03:50.163 --> 03:51.858
Yes, sir, Mr. Soup.

03:51.965 --> 03:55.457
We were just walking by and we saw
Bobby sneaking in the window...

03:55.568 --> 03:58.298
and I wanted to make sure
Connie was okay.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.201
Bobby Hill, out the window!

04:01.674 --> 04:04.939
Chang, you and your friends
may use the door.

04:05.211 --> 04:06.405
[crickets chirping]

04:08.681 --> 04:09.705
[groaning]

04:09.816 --> 04:12.683
All right, guys. The girls aren't here.

04:12.785 --> 04:15.310
We don't have to pretend to be tough.

04:15.421 --> 04:19.221
Come on. I--I live next door.

04:19.325 --> 04:23.887
All I have to do is scream and my dad
will be on you like flies on pie!

04:24.264 --> 04:28.030
If you eat some dirt,
then maybe I'll leave you alone.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.593
But I don't wanna eat any dirt.

04:31.537 --> 04:33.129
Maybe just a little.

04:37.143 --> 04:40.840
-Yum, that's good dirt.
-You didn't eat any.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.572
(Bobby) Dad! Dad! Dad!

04:44.017 --> 04:45.279
[snoring]

04:53.092 --> 04:55.322
[speakiig Spaiish]

04:56.095 --> 04:57.756
[all shoutiig]

04:59.599 --> 05:00.759
Help!

05:00.867 --> 05:01.891
Bobby?

05:02.235 --> 05:04.499
-What have you been eating?
-Dirt!

05:04.604 --> 05:09.473
Chang Wassanasong made me eat dirt!
He beat me up!

05:09.776 --> 05:11.539
[sighing] I'll get some ice.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.706
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll find out Chang's address...

05:15.815 --> 05:19.114
so you can go over there
and make his dad eat dirt.

05:19.786 --> 05:22.118
Bobby, remember when you were
10 years old...

05:22.221 --> 05:24.849
and I pulled that
big girl off you at the park?

05:25.992 --> 05:28.426
That's not happening anymore.

05:28.695 --> 05:32.153
There is only one person who can fight
your battles for you.

05:32.265 --> 05:36.258
And I know you don't want to hear this,
but that person is you.

05:36.369 --> 05:39.429
Look at me! This can't fight.

05:39.605 --> 05:42.665
Then take a boxing course at the YMCA.

05:42.775 --> 05:46.802
You can learn anything at the Y.
That's where I learned how to fight.

05:47.380 --> 05:50.213
You know, that's also
where I learned to swim.

05:50.550 --> 05:54.213
So, taking those boxing lessons
kept the bullies from picking on you?

05:56.422 --> 05:58.982
Bullies, picking on me?

06:03.596 --> 06:05.359
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

06:05.565 --> 06:06.759
[birds chirping]

06:06.866 --> 06:08.561
I'm sorry. Boxing is full.

06:08.668 --> 06:12.434
But I can put you on the wait list.
People are always getting hurt.

06:12.538 --> 06:16.099
You've gotta help me defend
myself from Chang Wassanasong.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.973
There is one other class,
but it wouldn't be right for you.

06:19.078 --> 06:22.514
There's nothing about the YMCA
that's right for me.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.148
But until I'm famous enough
to afford my own bodyguard...

06:26.252 --> 06:29.346
I am going to have to learn
how to defend myself!

06:29.455 --> 06:31.047
Now, do your job, sir!

06:31.157 --> 06:32.954
[women chattering]

06:40.400 --> 06:41.628
[whistle blowing]

06:43.336 --> 06:46.362
Every one of you in this class
is heavily armed right now.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.066
That's right. Your key chain, your fists...

06:49.509 --> 06:51.409
that huge engagement ring.

06:52.612 --> 06:56.946
Are you sure you're in the right class?
This is women's self-defense.

06:59.218 --> 07:03.552
Please, Miss. All the other courses are full.
I'm sorry. It's for women only.

07:03.656 --> 07:06.124
We're trying to maintain
a certain comfort level here.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.693
But I hate men as much as you.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.491
I don't hate men! I just hate being a victim!

07:11.597 --> 07:13.963
I hate being a victim, too.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.397
Look, I was at a girls'
slumber party last night...

07:17.503 --> 07:20.700
when three men pushed me to the ground
and made me eat dirt!

07:20.807 --> 07:21.774
[gasping]

07:21.874 --> 07:23.000
(woman) My.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.270
Okay, you can stay.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.714
Now, grab a whistle
and prepare to be empowered!

07:28.815 --> 07:32.273
Most women who are attacked
are subdued by verbal threats.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.819
Today, we're going to get used
to hearing these threats...

07:34.921 --> 07:38.322
keeping our cool, and practicing
some responses of our own...

07:38.424 --> 07:41.359
to the most vulnerable areas
of a man's anatomy.

07:41.828 --> 07:45.787
-Shut up and give me your purse!
-I don't know you! That's my purse!

07:45.898 --> 07:47.058
[groaning]

07:47.166 --> 07:49.862
Okay. I want everybody to try it.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.060
You first.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.901
See? I don't hate men.

07:55.341 --> 07:59.368
-Give me your purse. Now!
-That's my purse.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.915
Don't be afraid to shout it.
That's my purse! Try it again.

08:03.616 --> 08:06.050
That's my purse! I don't know you!

08:06.152 --> 08:07.244
[grunting]

08:07.353 --> 08:08.377
[groaning]

08:08.488 --> 08:09.512
[women cheering]

08:09.622 --> 08:10.589
(woman) All right.

08:10.957 --> 08:11.946
[birds chirping]

08:12.058 --> 08:14.618
What did you get
for number five on the test?

08:14.727 --> 08:16.319
-""D.""
-""D""?

08:16.429 --> 08:17.418
[groaning]

08:17.530 --> 08:19.054
I thought you wrote ""B.""

08:19.165 --> 08:20.564
Booby.

08:21.667 --> 08:25.501
Connie, when you kiss this loser,
do you still taste dirt?

08:25.605 --> 08:28.130
No. Not anymore. Jerk!

08:28.574 --> 08:31.134
You asked her about the dirt,
she answered.

08:31.244 --> 08:35.977
-I don't think we have any more business.
-Don't smart-mouth me, Hill!

08:36.349 --> 08:37.714
[Connie exclaiming]

08:38.251 --> 08:39.741
Get away from me!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.615
[mimicking Bobby] Get away from me.

08:41.721 --> 08:45.521
-Come on, eat some dirt!
-Let go of my purse!

08:49.028 --> 08:50.290
I don't know you!

08:50.563 --> 08:52.121
[groaning]

08:53.299 --> 08:54.630
Who's next?

08:54.901 --> 08:56.232
[groaning]

08:57.770 --> 08:58.204
[dog barking]

08:58.204 --> 08:58.761
[dog barking]

08:58.871 --> 09:00.395
(Bobby) Mom! Dad!

09:00.773 --> 09:04.004
Chang was waiting for me after school!

09:04.110 --> 09:07.409
Did you remember to tell him
that inside every bully there's a coward?

09:07.513 --> 09:10.971
That's okay, Peggy.
I don't see any blood. No dirt.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.049
You ran away, didn't you?

09:13.152 --> 09:16.986
No. I stayed and fought! And I won!

09:17.089 --> 09:19.956
This is so much cooler
than getting beat up!

09:20.059 --> 09:23.392
Well, all right, Son!
You know, that Chang Wassanasong...

09:23.496 --> 09:26.897
must know all kinds
of Oriental martial arts.

09:27.033 --> 09:30.992
And you beat him
with good old American YMCA know-how.

09:31.270 --> 09:34.967
Yeah, we're all excited.
But before you get too carried away...

09:35.074 --> 09:38.237
I should let you know
that I got detention tomorrow.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.841
Detention for beating up a bully?

09:41.213 --> 09:46.082
I'd say somebody's earned himself
a trip to a PG-13-rated movie.

09:50.122 --> 09:52.750
My dad says that
whenever you're in a jail-type situation...

09:52.858 --> 09:56.089
the best way to survive is to take out
the biggest guy there.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.993
That way, you establish
who's boss right from the get-go.

09:59.365 --> 10:02.823
Or you can hang yourself with your pants.
He says that's another way to go.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.939
Which one of you guys is the tallest?

10:16.582 --> 10:17.571
[laughing]

10:17.683 --> 10:18.707
That's my purse!

10:18.818 --> 10:19.785
[groaning]

10:20.620 --> 10:21.644
I don't know you!

10:21.754 --> 10:22.721
[groaning]

10:24.690 --> 10:25.679
[birds chirping]

10:25.791 --> 10:28.123
It's the metal-shop kids.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.058
If they hassle us, just run.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.756
They won't
be able to catch us because they smoke.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.863
Bobby! Play any kickball today?

10:39.972 --> 10:44.409
-Why? You up for a game?
-Just saying hi. Just saying hi.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.402
Why are they scared?

10:46.946 --> 10:49.642
You didn't kick another person
in the groin, did you?

10:49.749 --> 10:51.216
Three people!

10:52.818 --> 10:57.118
I didn't go looking for trouble.
Trouble came a-knocking...

10:57.223 --> 10:59.589
and Bobby Hill's foot answered the door.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.119
You know, Bobby...

11:01.227 --> 11:03.752
I kind of liked it better
when you used to play dead...

11:03.863 --> 11:05.763
or joked your way out of a tight spot.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.490
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

11:08.634 --> 11:11.831
Tony Zamarti is wide open right now.

11:13.205 --> 11:14.570
(Bobby) Peters!

11:15.207 --> 11:17.732
You giving my friend here a hard time?

11:18.110 --> 11:22.513
Back off.
This is none of your business, Bobby.

11:22.615 --> 11:27.245
-I'm making it my business, Peters.
-What are you gonna do?

11:27.853 --> 11:30.651
You gonna kick me in the nads?

11:31.524 --> 11:35.654
Am I going to do it? Yes.
When am I gonna do it? Don't know.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.223
Could be tomorrow.... Now!

11:38.364 --> 11:39.456
[groaning]

11:39.565 --> 11:41.999
One thing you'll find out about me, Clark...

11:42.101 --> 11:45.127
is that I'm not a very patient person.

11:46.639 --> 11:47.799
[exclaiming]

11:50.976 --> 11:54.377
I wish I'd called you folks here
under pleasanter circumstances.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.141
But I'm afraid your son's
been caught fighting again...

11:56.248 --> 11:57.613
on the school grounds.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.550
First of all,
my son was just defending himself.

12:00.653 --> 12:04.180
Second of all,
I do consider these pleasant circumstances.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.616
Emily, send Bobby in.

12:08.027 --> 12:10.587
Bobby, you want to tell your parents
how you won your fight?

12:10.696 --> 12:13.893
-Which one? The one against Chang?
-Sure.

12:13.999 --> 12:18.265
Okay. There I was
standing in front of Chang.

12:18.537 --> 12:22.701
It didn't look good. I mean, let's face it.
He's faster and stronger than me.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.867
So, if I was gonna
beat this guy, I had to act fast.

12:26.979 --> 12:30.142
-Smart thinking, Son.
-So, I faked to my left.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.685
But he got ahold of me
and knocked me down. Down but not out.

12:33.786 --> 12:38.052
I yelled, ""Let go of my purse,""
at the top of my lungs.

12:38.457 --> 12:39.924
Then, with all my might...

12:40.025 --> 12:43.153
I kicked him
as hard as I could in his testicles.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.286
What?

12:44.396 --> 12:46.523
Tell your parents
about the Clark Peters fight.

12:46.632 --> 12:49.965
-So, there I was standing--
-Ju-just skip to the end of the fight.

12:50.069 --> 12:53.368
You mean before
or after I kicked him in the testicles?

12:53.472 --> 12:57.067
Bobby, l....
Where in the heck did you learn to do that?

12:57.176 --> 13:01.010
At the women's
self-defense course I signed up for at the Y.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.147
Women's self-defense?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.879
What did I do?

13:05.985 --> 13:08.749
It was your idea
to send him to the Y in the first place!

13:08.854 --> 13:11.288
So, I could point the finger at you!

13:11.390 --> 13:13.881
But I won't. But I could.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.085
[sighing]

13:15.194 --> 13:17.628
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to suspend Bobby from school...

13:17.730 --> 13:19.493
for a couple of days.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.631
Hank, can--can I talk to you alone?

13:23.736 --> 13:26.637
I mean, not as principal-to-parent,
but, you know, man-to-man.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.138
Sure.

13:29.775 --> 13:33.040
You can't have your boy going around
kicking people in their testicles.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.772
I know that, Carl.

13:35.648 --> 13:40.142
(Hank) This, Bobby, is the belt line.
You never ever hit below that.

13:40.486 --> 13:45.014
Always above. Never below.
Cassius Clay never hit below the belt.

13:45.124 --> 13:49.993
But, Dad, if I'm in a fight with someone
who wants me to literally eat dirt...

13:50.129 --> 13:52.222
you're telling me
I shouldn't do the one thing...

13:52.331 --> 13:54.299
that's gonna save me. Boom!

13:54.400 --> 13:57.392
You learned a move
in a woman's self-defense class.

13:57.536 --> 14:00.630
-You are not a woman.
-But it works.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.667
Son, I'm gonna show you
how to fight above the belt. Here.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.974
They're my old YMCA gloves. Put them on.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.469
Okay.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.945
Now, Bobby, just to warn you...

14:12.051 --> 14:14.519
you're probably
gonna have to take a couple of shots...

14:14.620 --> 14:17.111
before you learn
how to protect yourself properly.

14:17.223 --> 14:19.783
Now, get your gloves up like this. Good.

14:22.494 --> 14:23.483
[grunts]

14:23.596 --> 14:25.621
Keep your hands up, Bobby,
and move a little.

14:25.731 --> 14:29.531
Don't just stand there like a pole.
Come on. Come on.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.199
[groaning]

14:31.370 --> 14:32.564
Come on. You're not moving.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.435
I am too! I'm backing away from you!

14:36.775 --> 14:39.801
Come on,
from side to side, Son. Like this. See?

14:40.412 --> 14:42.778
Come on. Come on. Here we go.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.174
Okay. Okay, now try to hit me
with a punch, as hard as you can. Come on.

14:47.286 --> 14:48.446
[grunting]

14:49.255 --> 14:52.622
You leave your face open,
you're gonna get popped. See? See?

14:52.758 --> 14:54.225
Pop? Pop? See?

14:54.326 --> 14:55.623
[grunting]

14:55.761 --> 14:57.092
[screaming]

14:57.263 --> 14:58.992
You left yourself open, Dad.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.326
Pop, pop.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.559
[Hank groaning]

15:05.905 --> 15:10.808
You have been kicked in the testicles.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.207
[groaning]

15:13.445 --> 15:16.005
I palpated the left teste
and everything checks out.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.515
There's gonna be
quite a bit of swelling for a few days.

15:18.617 --> 15:23.111
-What about the other one?
-We can't find it right now.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.382
[groaning]

15:24.490 --> 15:25.582
No, no need to panic, though!

15:25.691 --> 15:26.885
I'm sure it's there.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.426
It'll probably make an appearance
when the swelling goes down.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.155
Man, lie still, man.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.026
You know, don't try
to move, man, because....

15:33.132 --> 15:34.429
[laughing]

15:35.267 --> 15:38.498
Kicking all them nuts, man.
Let alone testicles.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.901
Don't move, man.

15:44.243 --> 15:47.804
Dad, l--I thought
maybe you'd like some ice cream.

15:48.213 --> 15:50.181
[people chattering on TV]

15:51.116 --> 15:52.344
[sighing]

15:54.320 --> 15:56.413
I'm sorry about what happened.

15:56.522 --> 16:00.549
-But when you hit me in the nose--
-You mean the nose above your belt?

16:00.659 --> 16:02.217
If I remember correctly...

16:02.328 --> 16:05.923
and your shot below my belt
hasn't affected my memory...

16:06.098 --> 16:09.124
I was teaching you
how to fight above the belt.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.964
It was the way I learned
how to defend myself.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.130
By kicking me in my fellas?

16:14.440 --> 16:17.102
Dirty pool, Mister. Dirty pool.

16:18.344 --> 16:21.108
[sighs] Now, let's discuss
your punishment.

16:21.413 --> 16:23.278
Punishment? For what?

16:23.515 --> 16:27.474
You told me to go to the Y
and learn to defend myself and I did!

16:27.586 --> 16:32.353
No television, no video games,
and no ice cream until further notice.

16:32.458 --> 16:36.656
-That's not fair! You can't do that!
-I'll tell you what I can't do.

16:36.762 --> 16:40.721
Sleep on my stomach!
But I can sure as heck punish you.

16:43.435 --> 16:44.424
[Hank sighing]

16:44.536 --> 16:45.935
Bill, toss me a beer.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.506
I have to take my anti-coagulant.

16:48.907 --> 16:51.171
I live in constant fear of the day...

16:51.276 --> 16:54.074
Joseph finally can take down his old man.

16:54.313 --> 16:58.647
If I were him, I'd do it while I was sleeping.
Best chance he's got.

16:58.751 --> 17:02.312
Although, I've recently learned
how to sleep with my eyes open.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.320
God, am I tired!

17:05.424 --> 17:08.621
How I wish I had a son
to kick me in the nuts.

17:09.494 --> 17:10.689
[groans]

17:11.730 --> 17:14.028
Be careful what you wish for.

17:14.299 --> 17:17.734
Yeah. I promise you
Bobby's sorry he ever did that.

17:17.836 --> 17:22.603
Right now he's out back pulling weeds.
No gloves, no weasel.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.105
Ragweed for m'lady.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.741
Where have you been?

17:33.852 --> 17:37.948
Word in the halls is you got suspended
for kicking Principal Moss in the crotch.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.892
What? No. That's crazy.
I kicked my dad in the crotch.

17:42.995 --> 17:46.226
You kicked your father?
We all have those feelings, Bobby...

17:46.331 --> 17:47.798
but you never act on them.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.992
[knocking at door]

17:49.535 --> 17:53.562
I heard what you did
to Chang Wassanasong. Unforgivable.

17:54.039 --> 17:57.998
Then I heard what you did to your father.
Very funny. So, I'm conflicted.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.374
My dad didn't think it was funny.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.107
So he's given me a million chores to do.

18:03.215 --> 18:06.184
What? The old man punishing you?

18:06.452 --> 18:08.317
You don't have to take that from him.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.480
Till he can get up
from that chair, you the boss!

18:13.725 --> 18:14.953
[beeping]

18:15.861 --> 18:18.091
That better not be what I think it is.

18:18.197 --> 18:21.689
And I think it's a Game Boy.
Is it a Game Boy?

18:21.800 --> 18:23.461
Yeah, Dad. It's a Game Boy.

18:23.569 --> 18:27.335
That's a videogame.
I told you no videogames. Give it to me.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.407
-Hold on. I'm almost done.
-Now.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.376
-ln a minute.
-lf you don't bring that to me right now--

18:33.479 --> 18:35.447
In a minute. In a minute.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.339
[groaning]

18:37.449 --> 18:38.916
Get back here!

18:40.252 --> 18:42.345
God, the pain is unbearable!

18:42.654 --> 18:45.214
All right, Mister, you've got one minute.

18:45.324 --> 18:46.552
[gasping]

18:47.259 --> 18:50.160
Dang it, Bobby!
It has been at least a minute.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.932
-You started a new game, didn't you?
-Yes.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.600
-We had a deal!
-Hank, what is going on?

18:59.705 --> 19:01.434
I'm punishing Bobby.

19:03.008 --> 19:06.603
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Give me that goddang videogame.

19:06.712 --> 19:10.341
Not now.
I'm dealing with a giant spider here.

19:10.482 --> 19:14.509
Bobby Hill, you give your father that game
and you do it right now!

19:14.620 --> 19:18.681
That's okay. I got it under control.
He's gonna give me the game.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.190
Soon. Soon. I'm almost bored with it.

19:21.293 --> 19:25.093
-Why don't you go inside? I'll find you later.
-Come on.

19:29.902 --> 19:33.736
-Hand it over!
-Mom, this is between Dad and me.

19:33.972 --> 19:37.567
And I'll give him the Game Boy
when I decide I'm ready to.

19:38.043 --> 19:42.412
That is it! I would not let a stranger,
let alone my own son...

19:42.514 --> 19:44.573
think for one second
that they can get away...

19:44.683 --> 19:47.982
with showing any disrespect
towards the man that I love!

19:48.086 --> 19:51.249
You do that, and you have to
deal with Peggy Hill!

19:51.490 --> 19:55.051
What are you doing, Mom?
What are you doing?

19:55.961 --> 19:59.192
-Come on, Mom. Don't.
-Game over, Bobby!

19:59.531 --> 20:01.021
[both grunting]

20:01.133 --> 20:02.828
Come on. That's it!

20:03.001 --> 20:04.901
Come on! Show me what you got!

20:06.038 --> 20:07.335
[groaning]

20:07.673 --> 20:10.574
(Peggy) Give me that Game Boy!
Give me that....

20:10.909 --> 20:12.069
[both grunting]

20:12.177 --> 20:13.166
No!

20:13.545 --> 20:14.773
[panting]

20:17.049 --> 20:18.744
Clever little.... Got you!

20:18.850 --> 20:22.342
(Peggy) Come to Mama.
That's right. And I have....

20:22.854 --> 20:24.287
[both grunting]

20:24.389 --> 20:25.413
Yeah!

20:25.524 --> 20:27.515
That's mine! Give it back!

20:28.026 --> 20:29.391
In a minute.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.953
That's my purse!

20:32.631 --> 20:34.189
[Bobby grunting]

20:38.770 --> 20:40.601
That's right, Bobby.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.971
I believe you will find
that I have no testicles.

20:44.409 --> 20:48.903
-Where's your secret weapon now?
-She bluffing! Finish her!

20:49.014 --> 20:52.108
I'm sorry, Mom. It was a reflex.

20:52.284 --> 20:53.581
[grunting]

20:54.052 --> 20:57.351
Mom, okay! I said I was sorry!

20:57.623 --> 20:58.920
[groaning]

20:59.358 --> 21:01.451
All right, Peggy, let him go.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.464
Dinner in 10.

21:13.805 --> 21:17.138
I guess next time
you won't try to take on your old man.

21:17.242 --> 21:19.039
What are you so proud about?

21:19.144 --> 21:21.806
You had to get Mom
to fight your battle for you.

21:21.913 --> 21:24.473
That's worse than me
kicking below the belt.

21:24.583 --> 21:25.777
[laughing]

21:25.884 --> 21:29.581
Yeah. It's not so fun
when someone doesn't fight fair, is it?

21:30.022 --> 21:33.423
Just remember
I can get her to do that any time I want.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.153
[grunts]

21:35.861 --> 21:36.850
Peggy?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.726
(Peggy) Is there a problem out there, Hank?

21:40.032 --> 21:42.432
We'll be right in. Now, go wash up.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.768
[groaning]

21:48.907 --> 21:50.465
Okay, deep breath.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.166
[Haik groaiiig]

22:28.246 --> 22:30.942
(Bobby) That's my purse! I doi't kiow you!
