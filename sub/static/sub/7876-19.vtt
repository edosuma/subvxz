00:36.500 --> 00:37.990
Your daughter is gorgeous.

00:38.115 --> 00:39.365
Bone structure.

00:40.182 --> 00:41.991
This is such an interesting piece.

00:42.116 --> 00:43.416
Boner structure.

00:45.183 --> 00:47.543
Reminder... There's sponge cake
and/or cheese

00:47.668 --> 00:48.704
in the piano room.

00:48.829 --> 00:50.132
That sounds delightful!

00:50.345 --> 00:51.728
Okay, I've got a good joke.

00:51.853 --> 00:55.110
What's the difference
between a golf ball and a g-spot?

00:58.842 --> 01:00.810
That's just the setup, honey.

01:01.027 --> 01:04.126
A man will spend 20 minutes
looking for a golf ball.

01:05.236 --> 01:08.274
Because it's more important to find
a golf ball than to please our wives!

01:10.511 --> 01:13.192
Looks like the health care bill
is mired in the senate again.

01:13.317 --> 01:15.493
- Oh, God, they did it again?
- Oh, come on!

01:15.618 --> 01:18.563
I don't think our health care system
can be reformed.

01:18.741 --> 01:19.912
Oh, really?
Why not?

01:23.107 --> 01:24.791
Uh-huh... What?

01:26.374 --> 01:27.856
You caught me!

01:27.981 --> 01:29.231
I have no idea.

01:29.730 --> 01:31.757
I just say stuff sometimes.

01:33.503 --> 01:35.469
Look, everyone...
Her dress is see-through!

01:36.447 --> 01:39.807
How come every time we go to a party
you push me in the pool!

01:39.975 --> 01:42.350
Everyone's always afraid
to be the first one in the pool.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.457
You're that girl...
You're the party starter.

01:44.582 --> 01:47.278
My purse tampons
were floating in the water!

01:47.623 --> 01:50.322
People were impressed
by how big they got.

01:50.447 --> 01:52.379
Francine embarrassed you again, huh?

01:52.504 --> 01:54.864
Klaus, she's terrible
in social situations.

01:55.033 --> 01:56.463
She doesn't know when to laugh,

01:56.588 --> 01:58.607
she talks about things
she doesn't know about.

01:58.732 --> 02:02.736
You know, Stan, she's the reason
you never get invited to fancy events.

02:02.958 --> 02:04.665
Like Bullock's cocktail parties.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.041
Exactly!

02:06.297 --> 02:09.164
Bullock always has dignitaries
and heads of state there.

02:09.289 --> 02:12.348
Like, I bet if I was married
to Helen Mirren, we'd get invited.

02:12.473 --> 02:16.323
She'd wear her silver mane up,
showing off that sophisticated neck.

02:16.543 --> 02:20.542
A bobby pin would fall out, and
a rebellious lock would cascade down.

02:20.897 --> 02:23.145
I'd get in real close and whisper...

02:23.270 --> 02:25.420
"You have a loose hair, hellcat."

02:29.383 --> 02:30.252
Dudes!

02:30.510 --> 02:33.986
Vince Chung's throwing a bonfire beneath
the water tower tomorrow night,

02:34.211 --> 02:35.400
and get this...

02:35.525 --> 02:38.625
Anyone can come,
as long as they bring booze

02:38.946 --> 02:40.076
or girls!

02:40.303 --> 02:41.577
My sister's a girl!

02:41.746 --> 02:45.651
Yeah, but they have to be prettier
than Leelee Sobieski.

02:46.607 --> 02:48.876
Then we shall gain
our entry with booze.

02:49.164 --> 02:52.212
A kid from Hebrew school
told me about a guy named Warren

02:52.337 --> 02:54.793
who hangs out in the alley
behind liquor time

02:54.918 --> 02:56.592
and buys kids beer.

02:56.887 --> 02:59.009
Excellent!
We'll go after school.

02:59.335 --> 03:01.597
So, you're still doing
that whole Hebrew thing, huh?

03:01.893 --> 03:04.094
Yes, Steve!
It's who I am!

03:04.515 --> 03:06.115
It's everything to me!

03:09.152 --> 03:12.691
This is interesting, Francine.
Congress is in session now.

03:12.816 --> 03:13.597
In.

03:13.962 --> 03:17.599
So if we're at a party, say,
and someone asks whether it's in or not,

03:17.724 --> 03:19.366
you'll know that it is in.

03:21.705 --> 03:24.128
Oh, and look at this...
It says energy drinks for women

03:24.253 --> 03:26.473
are the hottest thing in a cool,
pink can...

03:26.598 --> 03:28.374
What am I doing?
I'm reading an ad.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.224
Knock, knock.
Sorry to interrupt.

03:30.349 --> 03:32.095
- Hi, Libby!
- I just got a call.

03:32.220 --> 03:35.155
My father's coming into town and will be
staying with us for a few days.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.337
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah, yeah, should be great fun.

03:38.462 --> 03:40.146
Oh, also, he doesn't know I'm gay.

03:40.271 --> 03:43.455
If I could keep a few things over here
while he's in town, that'd be great.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.842
Our mapplethorpe prints, our baby,

03:45.967 --> 03:48.301
this new drawing
I did of Burt Reynolds...

03:48.426 --> 03:51.313
- It's unfinished. Don't finish it.
- Terry, this is insane.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.441
Okay, the kitchen door entrance
is supposed to be just family.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.912
We've been together for nine years,
we have a baby...

03:57.037 --> 03:58.615
you have to tell your father!

03:58.740 --> 04:00.198
You don't understand, okay?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.734
You don't know what it's like
being the son of Tank Bates.

04:02.859 --> 04:05.168
Wait. Tank Bates is your father?

04:05.293 --> 04:08.289
The all-pro fullback
for the Washington Redskins Tank Bates?

04:08.414 --> 04:11.834
Yes. That's why he's coming into town.
They're retiring his jersey.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.255
Theismann pitches out to Bates,
Bates comes around the end,

04:14.380 --> 04:17.088
the offensive line clears a hole,
he leaps over the top, and he's short!

04:17.213 --> 04:19.173
He's stopped at the one-yard line!

04:20.933 --> 04:23.576
Oh, it's okay, they scored
on the next play... Quarterback sneak.

04:23.701 --> 04:26.108
Football! Catch the fever!

04:26.758 --> 04:28.194
Terry, Greg is right.

04:28.319 --> 04:29.821
You don't want Libby to grow up

04:29.946 --> 04:33.005
thinking being gay is something
to be ashamed of, do you?

04:33.372 --> 04:34.722
As her godmother,

04:34.847 --> 04:37.447
I'll be there to support you
all the way.

04:38.340 --> 04:39.925
You know what?
You're right.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.400
It's time I tell my father
the truth.

04:43.468 --> 04:46.365
Hey, you mind if come over and toss
the ol'pigskin around with your dad

04:46.490 --> 04:48.287
before you tell him
you're a banana crammer?

04:48.412 --> 04:50.039
He probably won't feel
like it after.

04:54.429 --> 04:56.273
I don't see him.
Just some kids.

04:56.398 --> 04:59.454
We all see the kids, Steve! God!

04:59.687 --> 05:00.787
There he is.

05:07.755 --> 05:09.807
Excuse me?
Are you Warren?

05:10.189 --> 05:11.644
Help you boys get loaded?

05:12.499 --> 05:14.682
You're the guy
who buys booze for kids?!

05:14.807 --> 05:16.535
Sure.
It's a great way to make money.

05:16.660 --> 05:19.504
That's how I bought my boom box,
that's how I bought my dog, Pepper,

05:19.629 --> 05:22.485
and that's how I bought this folding
chair that turns into a backpack.

05:22.610 --> 05:24.424
I put it on,
and I'm completely mobile.

05:24.549 --> 05:25.414
Great!

05:25.539 --> 05:28.018
- We'd like liquor, please.
- All right, be right back.

05:28.143 --> 05:30.460
If some little girl with a bruise
on her cheek comes by

05:30.585 --> 05:32.840
and says this is her dog, it is.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.416
Pepper is stolen.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.845
Terry, don't worry.
It'll be fine.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.638
Oh, God. Oh, God.

05:43.182 --> 05:44.932
Sweetie, you can do this.

05:50.054 --> 05:51.188
Hey there, kid.

05:51.313 --> 05:52.101
Hi, Dad.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.268
He's so big!

05:53.436 --> 05:54.939
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was...

05:55.064 --> 05:57.257
I have something to tell,
and if I don't do it right now

05:57.382 --> 05:58.738
I might never be able to.

05:58.863 --> 06:00.149
All right.
What is it?

06:00.422 --> 06:01.422
You see...

06:01.719 --> 06:02.444
I...

06:03.229 --> 06:04.229
I'm...

06:07.951 --> 06:10.447
This is my girlfriend Francine
and we had this baby out of wedlock,

06:10.572 --> 06:13.075
and I didn't tell you
because I knew you wouldn't approve.

06:13.314 --> 06:14.398
And who are they?

06:14.523 --> 06:17.469
That's Stan and Greg,
the homos from across the street.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.389
Morning. How'd you sleep?

06:23.514 --> 06:25.912
Terrible.
Is that the first couch ever made?

06:27.096 --> 06:28.567
I can't believe Terry!

06:28.692 --> 06:31.375
That is my house
and my partner and my baby!

06:31.500 --> 06:33.519
And here I am,
living out of an overnight bag

06:33.644 --> 06:35.686
in a tear-down across the street!

06:38.704 --> 06:40.611
- Good morning, Mr. Bates.
- Morning.

06:40.736 --> 06:42.982
You know, I was just wondering
what the hell this is.

06:43.107 --> 06:44.757
Oh, it's Terry's. He...

06:46.478 --> 06:48.847
Our sex last night
was so satisfying.

06:48.972 --> 06:51.307
When I entered you that was divine!

06:53.019 --> 06:54.587
I've slept on it, and...

06:54.712 --> 06:56.457
I've decided I can accept this.

06:56.896 --> 06:59.147
Even though you had this baby
out of wedlock,

06:59.272 --> 07:01.670
I know you'll do the right thing
and get married.

07:02.921 --> 07:06.240
Yes, of course we will.
Finally make an honest women out me.

07:06.365 --> 07:07.665
Her. Out of her.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.432
Francine, you need to come home.
Greg won't stop being snarky.

07:13.557 --> 07:14.931
Please be patient, Stan.

07:15.056 --> 07:18.494
Terry said he'll tell his father...
He's just waiting for the right moment.

07:21.928 --> 07:22.941
Look at him.

07:23.354 --> 07:24.914
He's just gonna float away.

07:25.039 --> 07:26.601
Float away like a fairy.

07:28.462 --> 07:29.448
Look at him.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.742
Carrying those heavy trash cans
like a girl.

07:32.778 --> 07:36.121
He probably wishes that rock
was a big, naked man.

07:39.145 --> 07:41.745
Yeah, whistle a show tune,
you drag queen!

07:46.068 --> 07:48.368
- What a day. Where's dinner?
- At the store.

07:48.493 --> 07:50.739
I don't cook, Stan...
We'll just have to go out to dinner.

07:50.864 --> 07:52.620
But... It's a weekday.

07:52.745 --> 07:54.791
That's once-in-a-while-
on-weekends talk!

07:54.916 --> 07:57.402
- Straight women don't ask for much.
- They really don't...

07:57.527 --> 08:00.687
Use coasters now and again and don't
whizz in the shower on her birthday.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.663
Have you seen Steve? I want to see
his face when I tell him

08:03.788 --> 08:06.111
the midget who acted
inside of R2-D2 died.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.695
Love it, love everything about it.
But he's out at a party.

08:08.942 --> 08:10.832
I bought him so much beer!

08:11.154 --> 08:12.900
Roger, you can't buy beer for Steve!

08:13.025 --> 08:14.150
He's only 14.

08:14.275 --> 08:17.808
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I did it for $12 profit.

08:22.176 --> 08:24.126
- Director Bullock!
- Smith.

08:24.693 --> 08:26.379
Hi. Greg Corbin.
Stan's neighbor.

08:26.504 --> 08:28.625
From Action News!
Of course!

08:28.750 --> 08:30.873
You and your partner Terry
are great.

08:30.998 --> 08:34.498
I had several gay experiences
when I was in boarding school.

08:34.678 --> 08:37.678
Nothing too big,
just some boyish night poundings.

08:39.047 --> 08:41.890
What a coincidence!
That's my favorite vintage!

08:42.015 --> 08:44.225
Would you like to join us for a glass,
director Bullock?

08:44.350 --> 08:46.700
I suppose I could stay
for one glass.

08:50.778 --> 08:52.480
And Heisenberg's wife was unhappy,

08:52.605 --> 08:55.274
because when her husband had the time,
he didn't have the energy.

08:55.399 --> 08:58.143
And when he had the position,
he didn't have the momentum.

09:00.224 --> 09:02.624
See? Because of his wife...
I don't even know!

09:02.946 --> 09:05.037
You know, Stan,
this is very last-minute,

09:05.162 --> 09:08.126
but I'm having a small cocktail party
tomorrow night.

09:08.251 --> 09:10.340
Would you and...
Greg care to come?

09:11.746 --> 09:16.228
<i>Say it loud
and there's music playing</i>

09:16.786 --> 09:18.864
<i>Say it soft</i>

09:18.989 --> 09:22.853
<i>And it's almost like praying</i>

09:23.560 --> 09:25.415
<i>Maria...</i>

09:26.029 --> 09:29.069
<i>I'll never stop saying</i>

09:29.537 --> 09:31.017
<i>Maria</i>

09:38.470 --> 09:40.526
Excellent way to express joy.

09:40.824 --> 09:43.024
See you both tomorrow night, then.

09:43.376 --> 09:45.877
I finally got invited
to a Bullock party!

09:46.002 --> 09:47.562
I'm in the big leagues now!

09:47.687 --> 09:49.837
My Helen Mirren, my little queen!

09:52.116 --> 09:54.988
I'm just calling to tell you
this will all be over soon.

09:55.113 --> 09:57.047
I locked Terry and Tank in the den.

09:57.172 --> 10:00.416
They're not going anywhere
until Terry tells him the truth.

10:00.541 --> 10:03.147
I got to go! Here's my credit card!
Put $30 on it...

10:03.272 --> 10:04.897
That's what I feel like I owe.

10:07.989 --> 10:10.901
Terry? I hope you're talking
to your father in there.

10:11.399 --> 10:13.010
Talking to me about what?

10:13.898 --> 10:16.009
Well, I need to tell you something.

10:16.303 --> 10:17.554
What are you doing?

10:17.768 --> 10:19.886
- What's going on? What's been said?
- Not much.

10:20.011 --> 10:22.068
Terry's crazy broad locked us
in here.

10:22.193 --> 10:24.539
It was pretty quiet
until I flipped to Skinemax.

10:25.595 --> 10:29.445
Just father and son sitting around
and watching a guy plow a girl.

10:29.682 --> 10:31.932
You only like this 50%, huh, fairy?

10:32.541 --> 10:34.628
I like this 100%.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.487
See what he's like?

10:38.612 --> 10:41.725
Francine, I appreciate you trying,
but I am never telling him.

10:41.850 --> 10:45.399
I don't know what I was thinking.
Thank god Stan burst in when he did.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.466
- Why did you do that?!
- Do what?

10:47.591 --> 10:49.565
Test the ax that could save
our lives in a fire?

10:49.858 --> 10:52.230
Oh, I don't know, maybe 'cause I care
a whole hell of a lot!

10:52.355 --> 10:55.454
I mean, I try so hard
and you try so little, and I just...

10:55.579 --> 10:56.879
I don't know.

10:58.637 --> 11:00.508
You're prettier
than all your sisters.

11:00.633 --> 11:02.869
Roger, Steve could be dead.
He could be...

11:03.441 --> 11:05.441
What up, you ass-face bitches?

11:05.750 --> 11:07.000
You stupid-ass.

11:09.057 --> 11:10.807
Well, hello, potty mouth.

11:10.932 --> 11:12.756
So I guess the party
was pretty good, then?

11:12.881 --> 11:13.863
S' awesome!

11:13.988 --> 11:15.955
I made out with a girl
I met at this place

11:16.080 --> 11:19.603
I went to after to get
some late-night za and da.

11:19.728 --> 11:20.846
Za and...?

11:21.226 --> 11:23.037
Pizza and soda.

11:23.409 --> 11:26.342
When you're drunk, you don't have time
for the beginning of words.

11:26.467 --> 11:28.645
All you care about
is ood and oonani.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.333
You're fun hammered!

11:31.458 --> 11:34.204
I swear, that's the first time
you've genuinely made me laugh.

11:34.329 --> 11:36.987
You guys want to meet her?
Come on in, baby!

11:45.374 --> 11:46.724
She's so heinous!

11:46.937 --> 11:49.305
What have I done?
Oh, Hayley, you were right.

11:49.430 --> 11:52.169
Minors should never drink alcohol.
I see that now.

11:52.736 --> 11:54.122
Eat my mouth.

11:58.905 --> 12:02.568
I will make up for what I have done
if it takes the rest of my life.

12:02.961 --> 12:04.298
Still wet, still wet.

12:04.586 --> 12:06.286
You don't have toenails.

12:07.168 --> 12:09.478
Hello, I'm Roger.
I like to pretend!

12:10.003 --> 12:11.136
Come on!

12:16.252 --> 12:18.624
Your book was so inspiring,
Mr. Mandela.

12:18.749 --> 12:22.753
- It made me want to become journalist.
- I am so happy it spoke to you.

12:23.055 --> 12:25.736
I don't know what book he's talking
about, but I love your movies.

12:25.861 --> 12:28.455
Especiallythe bucket list.
Whew, it got me.

12:29.088 --> 12:30.107
It got me.

12:30.232 --> 12:32.909
- Stan, I think you're mistaken.
- Aren't you Morgan Freeman?

12:33.034 --> 12:34.817
This is Nelson Mandela.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.338
Why did you think
I was calling him Mr. Mandela?

12:37.463 --> 12:39.587
I thought it was
one of Freeman's many nicknames,

12:39.712 --> 12:41.685
like captain Morgan or Freckles.

12:41.881 --> 12:43.709
Freckles, you want to hear a joke?

12:43.834 --> 12:47.514
Do they have jokes in your country,
or is it just sadness all the time?

12:47.639 --> 12:49.239
Are you sad right now?

12:52.419 --> 12:54.169
He pushed me in the pool.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.940
Oh, my god.

12:56.313 --> 12:57.942
I'm his Francine!

12:58.520 --> 12:59.982
Drink to dull your shame?

13:00.107 --> 13:02.139
Piggy wants two drinks.

13:02.442 --> 13:04.908
Drink it, piggy.
Does it taste good, pig?

13:10.790 --> 13:11.990
Hey, plus one!

13:12.162 --> 13:14.944
You remember me,
the person that you came here with?

13:15.069 --> 13:16.218
Who's the old guy?

13:16.343 --> 13:18.498
Stan Smith, this is Elie Wiesel,

13:18.623 --> 13:21.091
Nobel winning author of <i>Night</i>
and founder of...

13:21.216 --> 13:23.101
You're a son of a bitch,
you know that?

13:23.226 --> 13:24.476
Stan, please...

13:26.328 --> 13:28.628
You're embarrassed of me!
Admit it!

13:29.199 --> 13:30.305
Don't touch me!

13:30.430 --> 13:33.130
- Don't ever touch me!
- Stan, you're making a scene.

13:33.255 --> 13:34.439
That is not a scene.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.186
You want...
You want a scene?

13:36.311 --> 13:37.703
Here's your scene!

13:37.828 --> 13:39.486
Hope you can swim, weasel!

13:41.093 --> 13:42.028
It's Wiesel.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.614
And yes, I can.

13:46.473 --> 13:50.477
Well, you don't have to worry
about me embarrassing you ever again!

13:53.762 --> 13:54.791
Where's my wife?

13:56.155 --> 13:58.714
Francine, I need you
to come home right now.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.149
Greg was mean to me.

14:00.274 --> 14:03.216
What are you talking about, fruit loop?
She's Terry's girlfriend.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.518
No, she's not.

14:04.643 --> 14:05.843
She's my wife!

14:06.023 --> 14:08.388
Greg is Terry's boyfriend!

14:09.136 --> 14:11.733
- What?
- Terry and Greg are in love!

14:12.005 --> 14:13.859
Your son is gay!

14:15.839 --> 14:16.624
See?

14:16.749 --> 14:20.533
That's not how a straight guy faints.
This is how a straight guy faints.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.856
Where am I?
What happened?

14:26.981 --> 14:30.306
You outed Terry to his father,
then passed out,

14:30.601 --> 14:33.633
woke up, puked
and stumbled into the bushes!

14:34.554 --> 14:36.986
My dad's upstairs packing.
He didn't say a word.

14:37.111 --> 14:41.115
He looked at me, like he was envisioning
all the guys I ever had sex with,

14:41.377 --> 14:44.320
every late night massage,
every back alley zipper fight,

14:44.445 --> 14:47.302
every <i>Frasier</i> cast party,
every Honda test drive with Daryl.

14:47.964 --> 14:50.090
Everybody calm down.
I'll talk to Tank.

14:50.215 --> 14:52.641
I know what he's feeling.
I used to think like him.

14:52.898 --> 14:55.048
Scared of the intimate man dance.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.707
And there's always an underlying reason
for this kind of thing.

14:57.832 --> 14:59.314
You have to figure out what it is.

15:00.174 --> 15:02.384
I'm sorry I told you
your son was gay.

15:02.509 --> 15:04.442
But deep down, you must have known.

15:04.567 --> 15:07.988
- So this is a good thing.
- No, I had no idea. This is terrible.

15:08.470 --> 15:12.474
But... While you think it's terrible,
you're still glad your son's happy.

15:13.556 --> 15:17.012
Although... While you don't care
about your son's feelings,

15:17.137 --> 15:19.982
you realize that your prejudice
is based in ignorance?

15:20.107 --> 15:22.128
No, I understand it.
I just don't like it.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.970
However... While you may understand it
and not like it,

15:26.095 --> 15:29.839
you're sad that your son was unhappy and
kept this secret from you for so long.

15:29.964 --> 15:32.973
No. I'm happy I didn't know.
I wish I'd never known.

15:33.147 --> 15:34.647
Be that as it may...

15:35.144 --> 15:38.700
You think it's a choice, and you didn't
realize that people are born that way.

15:38.825 --> 15:42.025
No. I know it's not a choice,
and it still sickens me.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.403
Francine, you want to jump in here?
Any time, sweetheart.

15:46.790 --> 15:47.748
Dad, please...

15:47.873 --> 15:50.806
No, I'm going to a hotel
until my jersey retirement ceremony.

15:50.931 --> 15:52.731
You are no longer welcome.

15:55.798 --> 15:56.798
He's fine.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.637
He's probably just wondering
how two guys can do it. He'll calm down

16:00.762 --> 16:03.146
when I explain it's like cramming
together two puzzle pieces

16:03.271 --> 16:06.460
- that don't quite fit.
- Shut up, Stan! You've done enough.

16:07.962 --> 16:09.241
They're fine.

16:09.904 --> 16:11.726
I can't believe you!

16:13.270 --> 16:14.270
She's fine.

16:15.646 --> 16:18.823
I just need to figure out the reason
for Tank's hatred.

16:18.948 --> 16:22.063
I got it!
I know why Tank is reacting this way!

16:22.377 --> 16:24.762
- I'm sorry, are you talking to me?
- What?

16:24.887 --> 16:27.285
Oh, no, I was just having
an out loud realization.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.494
Would you like me to fill you in
on what it was...

16:30.619 --> 16:33.701
No, thanks. I've a lot of stuff going on
in my own life right now.

16:35.927 --> 16:38.884
What's he got going on
that's so important?

16:41.339 --> 16:45.083
<i>And my Megan,
she would have been 19 years old today.</i>

16:48.209 --> 16:49.774
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Holliday.</i>

16:49.899 --> 16:53.393
<i>Your last name is very misleading,
given your tragic circumstances.</i>

16:53.518 --> 16:56.668
<i>And now our last speaker from Madd,
Warren Beanstock.</i>

17:00.447 --> 17:02.847
<i>I recognize a lot of faces
here today.</i>

17:03.124 --> 17:05.002
<i>I've bought alcohol for many of you.</i>

17:05.127 --> 17:06.148
<i>But no more!</i>

17:06.374 --> 17:07.924
<i>I've changed my ways.</i>

17:08.619 --> 17:12.113
<i>I now understand what a terrible
epidemic underage drinking is.</i>

17:14.659 --> 17:18.287
<i>67% of young people who drink
before the age of 15</i>

17:18.412 --> 17:20.162
<i>will try an illicit drug.</i>

17:20.402 --> 17:23.708
<i>Last year, 21% of underage drivers
killed in accidents</i>

17:23.833 --> 17:25.108
<i>were intoxicated.</i>

17:26.342 --> 17:29.069
<i>And 96% of you
will wind up making out</i>

17:29.194 --> 17:30.632
<i>with a girl of this caliber.</i>

17:45.715 --> 17:47.619
Roger, I can't believe
you did this to me!

17:47.744 --> 17:50.905
You'll feel better after a few beers.
Come on, let's go get drunk.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.152
You're driving.

17:52.799 --> 17:55.490
<i>Today we retire the jersey
of a heck of a guy</i>

17:55.658 --> 17:57.758
<i>and a hell of a football player.</i>

17:57.953 --> 18:00.954
<i>It's an honor to be here
with Tank Bates,</i>

18:01.300 --> 18:04.050
<i>all-pro fullback
for the Washington Redskins!</i>

18:08.711 --> 18:12.187
<i>In his rookie season,
Tank rushed for over a thous...</i>

18:12.312 --> 18:14.551
Tank Bates is a homosexual!

18:20.999 --> 18:23.562
This is your plan
to reunite me and my father?

18:23.687 --> 18:25.309
Yeah, it totally makes sense.

18:25.434 --> 18:26.871
But my dad's not gay!

18:26.996 --> 18:27.996
Yes, he is.

18:28.121 --> 18:31.613
That's why he can't accept you,
because he can't accept himself.

18:31.738 --> 18:33.069
Like Kevin Spacey.

18:34.236 --> 18:35.422
In <i>K-Pax</i>.

18:40.504 --> 18:41.658
<i>I'm not gay!</i>

18:41.783 --> 18:43.779
<i>You see how scared he is
of being judged?</i>

18:43.979 --> 18:45.744
<i>Come on people, show your support!</i>

18:47.400 --> 18:48.965
<i>I am not gay!</i>

18:49.090 --> 18:50.083
<i>It's true.</i>

18:50.208 --> 18:52.058
<i>He's a notorious womanizer.</i>

18:52.266 --> 18:55.891
<i>He slept with all the cheerleaders,
the coach's daughter and...</i>

18:56.016 --> 18:58.576
<i>You're gonna love this...
My wife.</i>

18:59.005 --> 19:00.005
<i>Last week.</i>

19:00.317 --> 19:03.294
<i>Shattered our family.
And here I am, shaking his hand.</i>

19:03.508 --> 19:05.112
<i>I'm an embarrassment.</i>

19:05.455 --> 19:06.868
<i>But I need to work.</i>

19:06.993 --> 19:09.689
<i>I mean, what am I supposed to do?</i>

19:10.363 --> 19:11.236
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

19:11.361 --> 19:14.439
<i>But if 50,000 people
were willing to accept you</i>

19:14.564 --> 19:16.439
<i>when they thought you were gay,</i>

19:16.564 --> 19:18.990
<i>don't you think you should give
your own son a chance?</i>

19:22.686 --> 19:24.902
<i>You think I care
what these drunken slobs think?</i>

19:25.027 --> 19:27.024
<i>They'll cheer for anything!
Watch.</i>

19:27.149 --> 19:28.792
<i>I just had a beer fart!</i>

19:34.076 --> 19:36.632
<i>Dad, I'm sorry to do this here,
but I'm gay.</i>

19:36.757 --> 19:39.316
<i>That's who I am.
And this is who I'm with.</i>

19:39.441 --> 19:40.891
<i>Greg is my partner,</i>

19:41.016 --> 19:43.935
<i>we have a child together,
we're a family.</i>

19:44.060 --> 19:48.064
<i>I want you to be part of it, but only
if you can accept me for who I am.</i>

19:49.676 --> 19:50.676
<i>I can't.</i>

19:50.922 --> 19:53.622
<i>It's wrong
and I want nothing to do with it.</i>

19:56.043 --> 19:57.490
<i>Brenda, don't.</i>

19:57.663 --> 19:59.280
<i>You're breaking my heart.</i>

19:59.579 --> 20:02.342
<i>How could you do this?
How could you bring us here?</i>

20:02.467 --> 20:04.276
<i>How could you be so stupid?</i>

20:04.401 --> 20:06.585
<i>- How could you...
- Now, hold on a minute.</i>

20:06.710 --> 20:09.254
<i>Sure, Stan took something
extremely private</i>

20:09.379 --> 20:13.378
<i>and made it into a public spectacle,
but he was just trying to help.</i>

20:13.887 --> 20:17.237
<i>He may act like an idiot,
but it comes from a good place.</i>

20:17.631 --> 20:19.564
<i>That should count for something.</i>

20:19.689 --> 20:20.688
It counts!

20:20.813 --> 20:22.313
It counts for a lot!

20:23.433 --> 20:24.245
<i>See that?</i>

20:24.370 --> 20:28.050
<i>She loves him for who he is,
in spite of his many, many, many faults.</i>

20:28.175 --> 20:32.179
<i>If he can't accept you for who you are,
then you don't need him in your life.</i>

20:33.515 --> 20:35.358
Get him out of your life!

20:35.728 --> 20:37.778
<i>No, I don't need him in our life.</i>

20:40.657 --> 20:41.933
All's well!

20:43.833 --> 20:45.230
<i>You stood up for me.</i>

20:45.355 --> 20:47.226
<i>Even though I acted
like a complete fool.</i>

20:47.351 --> 20:48.351
<i>Of course.</i>

20:48.643 --> 20:50.043
<i>You're my husband.</i>

20:50.328 --> 20:51.678
<i>My idiot husband.</i>

20:59.151 --> 21:00.364
<i>Rudy.</i>

21:06.380 --> 21:07.366
<i>He did it!</i>

21:07.491 --> 21:10.491
<i>He got in the game for one play
and made a tackle!</i>

21:18.813 --> 21:22.593
OK. What's the difference between
a priest and a watch?

21:26.130 --> 21:28.822
- That wasn't the punch line.
- Joke's over, fellow, the lady laughed,

21:28.947 --> 21:29.775
move on.
