WEBVTT

00:06.307 --> 00:06.474
.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.175
- Previously on "Shooter"...

00:09.110 --> 00:10.244
- I'll confess to trying to kill
the president,

00:10.278 --> 00:11.412
but my wife and daughter
are left alone.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.381
- I planned it
down to the second.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.149
All you had to do was
shoot him.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.384
- He was already running.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.386
- You may draw your check
from someone else,

00:18.419 --> 00:19.553
but you work for me.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.455
- I'm here
in an unofficial capacity.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.125
Did your husband ever talk
to you about wanting medals?

00:24.158 --> 00:25.293
- You're asking
the wrong questions.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.527
- Officer Timmons,
how did you know

00:26.560 --> 00:27.661
he would be in that hotel room?

00:27.695 --> 00:29.630
- It's a--it's a cop thing.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.133
- You got him to confess?
Does his wife know?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.334
- You've been in contact
with her?

00:33.367 --> 00:35.236
- This whole thing seems off.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.505
- Do yourself a favor
and take your emotion out of it.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.640
- Swagger has to be taken
out of protective custody

00:39.673 --> 00:41.275
and put in general population.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.410
- Have fun.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.577
- [grunting]

00:43.611 --> 00:44.578
Aah!

00:44.612 --> 00:46.347
- Swagger finally start crying?

00:48.282 --> 00:50.418
- Hey, babe.
- You have no idea

00:50.451 --> 00:52.553
how long I've waited
to hear your voice.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.422
I wish you were here.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.623
What are you gonna do?

00:55.656 --> 00:57.325
- I'm gonna do what I do best.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.526
I'm gonna hunt.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.864
[indistinct shouting,
horns honking]

01:03.897 --> 01:07.101
[overlapping chatter]

01:11.205 --> 01:12.206
[bell dings]

01:13.207 --> 01:16.210
[radio chattering]

01:21.649 --> 01:23.451
- Find everything all right?

01:23.484 --> 01:24.718
- I did.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.455
Do you have any more
of these bandage rolls?

01:27.488 --> 01:29.457
- All we have is what's out.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.159
I need the cap to scan.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.893
- Of course.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.228
I'll take a look at this one.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.233
Hawks need the 12th man, right?

01:45.773 --> 01:48.476
- I think I might have a few
bandages left. Let me check.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.477
- You know what?
Don't worry about it.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.478
I don't need them.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.545
- It'll only take a sec.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.516
[ominous music]

01:55.549 --> 01:58.286
[line trilling]

01:59.587 --> 02:02.523
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.557
Are we alone?

02:03.591 --> 02:04.558
- Yes.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.693
[shotgun cocks]

02:05.726 --> 02:07.428
- I know you.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.530
You're Bob Lee Swagger.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.631
Now don't move.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.700
Doris, come over here.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.734
- [gulps]

02:16.537 --> 02:18.372
- So you're Doris?

02:18.406 --> 02:19.373
And you are?

02:19.407 --> 02:20.641
- Leo.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.344
- Okay, so everybody knows
each other.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.316
Now, Leo, that's
a Mossberg 12 gauge, huh?

02:28.349 --> 02:31.452
I see you got that
fancy pistol grip on there.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.620
It's real cool.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.255
- It ain't gonna matter to you.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.257
- No. No, it won't matter to me,

02:36.290 --> 02:37.558
but it will matter to Doris.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.328
The pistol grip means
you sacrifice some control.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.263
It affects your spread.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.531
You're gonna get me, no doubt,

02:43.564 --> 02:45.399
but you're also gonna get
your girl.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.969
Now, Leo,
I don't have to tell you

02:49.002 --> 02:51.805
what a gut shot
from this distance looks like.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.275
It's a mess.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.310
So why don't you and me just--

02:56.344 --> 02:57.411
[gunshot]

02:57.445 --> 02:58.546
[Doris shrieks]

02:58.579 --> 02:59.980
Both of you, sit on the floor.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.415
[Doris whimpering]

03:03.317 --> 03:05.453
Leo, I'll leave this
by the door.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.423
[intense music]

03:18.332 --> 03:18.666
.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.635
[phone ringing]

03:24.672 --> 03:25.973
- Agent Johnson.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.708
- You took a chance
exposing yourself.

03:31.345 --> 03:34.248
Man, you still put all that
sugar in your coffee?

03:34.282 --> 03:36.817
Never understood how you could
drink it like that.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.552
- Since I'm
two pounds of pressure

03:38.586 --> 03:40.588
from you ruining my suit,

03:40.621 --> 03:41.855
might as well finish it.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.560
That was a hell of a play
getting out of that prison.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.629
Maximum security.
Impressive.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.798
- Nah, it's nothing
compared to how you set me up.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.999
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.701
- Who's paying your bills?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.636
- I work for Homeland Security.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.837
- Come on, man.
I'm not recording this.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.806
You can drop the act.

03:58.839 --> 04:02.643
You know I got you scoped.
Answer the question.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.345
- I'm not gonna play this game,
Bob Lee.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.347
You want to kill me?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.816
I'm guessing you're halfway
into your trigger press.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.284
If you're gonna do it, do it.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.785
Otherwise,
we got to work this out.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.288
- Oh, so I can trust you now.
Is that it?

04:14.322 --> 04:15.823
- The evidence against you
is overwhelming.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.758
You're over with.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.427
- From now on,

04:19.460 --> 04:22.363
you're alive
because my family's alive.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.931
They get hurt, you get hurt.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.934
If something happens to them,
you die.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.002
And I won't care
who's responsible.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.971
- Oh, come on, man.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.940
I don't want
Julie and Mary to get hurt.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.875
- Good.
- So now that we've

04:34.908 --> 04:37.678
heard each other,
what next?

04:37.711 --> 04:39.847
- I figure it out:

04:39.880 --> 04:42.049
how you set me up,
who else is involved,

04:42.082 --> 04:43.384
and then I bring you all down.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.752
- That's not gonna end well.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.886
- Not for you, it doesn't.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.356
- Oh, shit!

04:48.389 --> 04:49.857
- I'd like to welcome

04:49.890 --> 04:51.759
each and every one of you
to the task force.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.327
You represent the best people

04:53.361 --> 04:55.396
from a large pool
of multi-agency candidates.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.064
Congratulations.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.933
Now that I have sufficiently
patted ourselves on the back,

04:59.967 --> 05:02.002
I'd like to introduce
Isaac Johnson.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.671
He is Secret Service,

05:03.704 --> 05:05.639
a member of the
president's Advance Team.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.041
Before that, he served
three tours in Afghanistan

05:08.075 --> 05:09.377
with Bob Lee Swagger,

05:09.410 --> 05:10.844
which makes him
uniquely qualified

05:10.878 --> 05:12.880
to discuss our fugitive.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.349
Agent Johnson.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.485
- You've all heard by now
that early this morning,

05:17.518 --> 05:20.754
I received a call from Swagger.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.356
During our brief conversation,

05:22.390 --> 05:24.425
he exhibited extreme paranoia,

05:24.458 --> 05:26.360
including the delusional belief

05:26.394 --> 05:29.029
that he's the victim
of a larger conspiracy.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.898
He may be desperate
and unstable,

05:30.931 --> 05:32.900
but he's still one of the best
snipers in the world,

05:32.933 --> 05:36.003
which makes him
a man to be feared.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.671
For a sniper to survive,

05:37.705 --> 05:39.773
he has to learn to become
invisible,

05:39.807 --> 05:41.108
to disappear
into his surroundings

05:41.141 --> 05:42.976
for long periods of time.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.479
After three tours
in Afghanistan,

05:45.513 --> 05:49.450
the official count credited him
with 210 combat kills.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.018
Prolific is an understatement.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.120
But the truth is

05:53.153 --> 05:56.156
his real count is closer to 390.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.059
Bob Lee's true skill
is killing.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.895
And he's mastered it.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.832
So he's not
just a great shooter.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.468
He's not just a man
who can hide in plain sight.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.070
He's patient,
he's committed,

06:10.103 --> 06:12.072
and he's fearless.

06:12.105 --> 06:15.509
Why didn't Bob Lee kill me
this morning?

06:15.543 --> 06:17.745
He knows I set him up.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.180
He trusted me as a friend.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.016
I betrayed him,
lied to him,

06:23.050 --> 06:25.419
tried to have him killed.

06:25.453 --> 06:28.088
I'm still alive for the
same reason he won't run.

06:28.121 --> 06:32.025
He wants to figure this thing
out and make us all pay.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.427
He should've died that day,

06:33.461 --> 06:35.963
but he didn't,

06:35.996 --> 06:38.966
and this is
our worst-case scenario.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.133
If he survives long enough,

06:40.167 --> 06:41.569
he will try to kill us all

06:41.602 --> 06:44.204
for what we've done to him.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.840
And why shouldn't he?

06:46.874 --> 06:48.742
- How do we know he won't talk?

06:48.776 --> 06:50.210
How do we know
he's not sitting down

06:50.243 --> 06:52.513
with some blonde reporter
right now?

06:52.546 --> 06:56.183
- Because I did my job well,
Payne,

06:56.216 --> 06:58.952
and he doesn't have the proof.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.188
- Didn't this guy used to be
your friend?

07:01.221 --> 07:02.990
- Once.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.459
The other reason is
that he loves his family,

07:05.493 --> 07:07.561
and they're vulnerable.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.963
And that is his only weakness.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.865
So if this drags on,

07:11.899 --> 07:13.901
and we don't catch him soon,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.202
we'll use them as bait.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.973
[rustling]

07:21.208 --> 07:23.176
[clacking]

07:23.210 --> 07:25.813
- Don't hit!
You have to play nice.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.782
I told you to stop being so mean
to Dollie.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.885
If you don't listen, I'm gonna
give you both a time out.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.555
- Mary, sweetheart,
come here.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.023
Come sit by me.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.226
Ooh-ah!

07:41.529 --> 07:44.131
Why is Janie being so mean
to Dollie?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.933
- She's in a bad mood

07:45.966 --> 07:49.002
'cause her daddy's gone too.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.039
- Yeah. You know what?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.273
You should tell her

07:53.306 --> 07:55.208
that sometimes
daddies have to go away,

07:55.242 --> 07:58.178
but that they always come back,

07:58.211 --> 08:00.013
just like your papa will.

08:01.014 --> 08:04.051
- I want him to come back now.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.087
- I know. Me too.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.624
You know what I just remembered?

08:10.658 --> 08:12.960
[gasps]
It's Wednesday.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.895
It's Wednesday!
That's your favorite day!

08:14.928 --> 08:18.031
It's lasagna day!
What?

08:18.065 --> 08:19.633
What if I go to the store
and get all the ingredients?

08:19.667 --> 08:20.634
Do you want to help me cook?

08:20.668 --> 08:21.635
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

08:21.669 --> 08:23.170
That'll cheer you up.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.306
- * Every day,
she sees her life *

08:26.339 --> 08:28.075
[phone rings]

08:28.108 --> 08:31.111
* Fade away and pass her by

08:31.144 --> 08:32.580
- Hello?
- Baby, I'm sorry you and Mary

08:32.613 --> 08:34.214
have to be dragged
through this.

08:34.247 --> 08:37.885
[key turns, music stops]

08:37.918 --> 08:39.252
- It's okay.
You'll prove you didn't do it,

08:39.286 --> 08:41.021
and then you'll come home.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.923
- We can't talk long.
It's not safe.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.224
I just wanted to hear
your voice.

08:44.257 --> 08:47.260
Of course it has to be
lasagna night. My favorite.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.096
- Then why don't you stop by?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.098
I'll be serving it up,
just like always.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.633
- I could always count on you
to keep your routine.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.568
- Where's he calling from?
- I don't know.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.969
He's accessed
a different network.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.104
- Looks like Eastern Europe.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.973
- I'm just scared.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.642
- You know I'll be watching out
for you.

09:01.675 --> 09:05.145
- No, I know that, but...
it's not that.

09:05.178 --> 09:08.115
What are Mary and I supposed
to do if this all drags on?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.083
Where are we supposed to go?

09:10.117 --> 09:12.185
- Fewer phone calls from now
on, hon. It's too risky.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.121
- [woman over PA system]
Attention, patrons.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.122
There's a blue Prius
in the parking lot

09:15.155 --> 09:16.123
with its lights left on.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.324
- I'm used to being alone.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.192
I can deal with uncertainty.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.729
It's just all of this feels
so unexpected sometimes--

09:21.762 --> 09:22.730
And I just--[gasps]
- Sorry.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.164
- Seriously?

09:24.197 --> 09:26.166
- I got to go, honey.
I got to go.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.138
- I'm going to the restroom
to clean it up.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.306
You guys gonna come with?

09:50.824 --> 09:51.124

09:51.158 --> 09:51.759
- Baby, what are you doing here?

09:52.826 --> 09:54.795
- Oh, my God, I miss you.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.196
- Are you okay?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.233
- Sweetheart, we don't have
a lot of time, okay?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.335
- Okay.
- How many in the store?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.271
- Two. And two more outside.
- No, baby.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.239
There's four outside.
You missed the gray Chevy.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.809
- Okay. I've only been the wife
of a fugitive for a few days.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.343
- It wasn't enough
to get a trace.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.112
- Play it back.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.380
Where's Julie Swagger?

10:13.413 --> 10:14.815
- Inside the store.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.750
- No matter what,
don't mention

10:16.784 --> 10:18.251
Isaac Johnson's name
to anyone.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.787
- Someone needs to know
the truth.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.689
- Yes, but we don't have
the whole truth yet.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.691
- But I can help.
- You're helping, Jules.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.258
- Look. Look.
Sam and I can get together.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.393
We can hold a press conference--

10:26.426 --> 10:29.229
- Honey, the will kill you.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.664
They're kill Mary.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.334
- Okay.

everything is about protecting
the two of you.

the actual shooter.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.730
- Play Bob Lee's.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.699

a woman that I know at the FBI.

11:05.733 --> 11:06.900
Nadine Memphis.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.001
- Yeah, she arrested me.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.003

I trust her.

- Okay. Mention the guy
who says he shot at me.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.007

11:15.909 --> 11:17.310
See what she does with that.

a lot harder for her.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.358

Musa Qala.

after he left the store?

12:43.130 --> 12:44.531
- What store?

12:44.564 --> 12:46.499
- Let me be clear.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.869
You're moving
way beyond suspect now.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.071
You're helping a fugitive
to evade capture,

12:51.104 --> 12:53.373
and that pushes you into a
whole new piece of real estate.

never let me help him.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.544
Not even if I wanted to.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.982

after he hung up,

when you two were alone?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.019
- Am I under arrest?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.569
- Video, no audio,
if you need to say something.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.043
- Kyle Timmons.
Do you know him?

13:30.077 --> 13:31.544
Do you know him?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.380

who shot at your husband?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.883

13:56.436 --> 13:58.605
Alexander Prosovich gave me
this number.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.573

14:00.607 --> 14:02.876
- Yeah, well,
not when you're his roommate.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.378
- Who are you?
I'll take message.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.147
- I'm Bob Lee Swagger.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.387
- You're talking to "him,"
Mr. Swagger.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.623
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.125
- Why should you?

14:18.158 --> 14:20.027
Just because you kill Ukrainian

14:20.060 --> 14:21.929
doesn't mean you know Russians.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.997
- I hate to disappoint you,
but I didn't actually shoot

14:24.031 --> 14:25.565
the Ukrainian president.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.902
- Too bad, because they're
going to capture you

14:28.936 --> 14:32.039
and eventually kill you
and your cute little family.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.443
- Alex said
you might be able to help

14:36.476 --> 14:38.045
get my family
out of the country.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.913
- Maybe.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.648
- What's it gonna take?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.984
- For the hero of Russia?

14:44.017 --> 14:46.119
100,000 even.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.955
- [scoffs]
That's the hero rate?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.522
- I've had expenses.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.226
- I think Swagger just sent me
a message.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.627
- You think?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.496
Either he did or he didn't.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.065
- I spoke to Julie Swagger
in the elevator.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.599
He wants me
to look into Kyle Timmons.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.468
- [sighs]
Swagger's delusional.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.436
- I'd like to run it out.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.438
- Okay.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.240
But no matter what you find,
you tell the wife

15:07.274 --> 15:08.708
you need to meet with Swagger
personally.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.510
If he thinks he has
a friend at the FBI,

15:10.543 --> 15:13.013
that's the opening we need
to capture him.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.481
Good work, Memphis.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.516
You were right to get her
to trust you.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.126
- You're late.
- I couldn't help it.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.528
I was with Meachum.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.030
- Anything I should know?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.967
- He didn't tell you?

15:34.001 --> 15:36.069
That's interesting.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.604
The Russians are claiming

15:37.637 --> 15:40.007
there's a missing piece
of evidence floating around.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.674
- Evidence of what?

15:41.708 --> 15:43.143
- Well, I don't exactly know,

15:43.176 --> 15:45.545
but it's making them
very nervous.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.115
Meachum wanted to know
if Dimitri had it.

15:49.749 --> 15:53.020
- I gave Meachum the newspaper
articles Memphis gave me.

15:53.053 --> 15:56.023
- No. No, it's something else.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.558
And since Dimitri didn't
have it on him,

15:58.591 --> 16:00.060
who the hell knows?

16:00.093 --> 16:01.694
- This just keeps getting
better.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.165
- And he wants an update
on Swagger.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.268
- The update is you missed him.
Twice.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.238
- [chuckles]
You chose Swagger. Not me.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.206
The way Meachum sees it,

16:13.240 --> 16:15.675
this is starting to fall
on your side of the ledger.

I won't miss again.
I'll tell you that.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.121
- Officer Timmons?

16:28.155 --> 16:32.059
I'd ask for an autograph,
but I don't have any paper.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.493
- You don't need paper.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.062
I'll sign whatever.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.129
Buy you a drink?

Uh, two of what he's having.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.738

16:45.772 --> 16:50.110
So I have a million questions
about that day.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.612
- Well, go ahead, honey.
My time is yours.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.115
- When did you first see
Bob Lee Swagger?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.319
- Right before it happened.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.588
He walked past me.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.823
Something about him
stuck out.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.259
- What was that?

17:06.293 --> 17:07.694
- His attitude.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.729
You do this long enough,

17:09.762 --> 17:11.831
you develop an instinct.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.234
- Yeah.
I read he was a sniper.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.769
I always figured
those guys blended in.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.339

your senses.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.776
I'm more perceptive.

to read me.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.682

You heard what I did,
and you were impressed.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.789
Yeah?
- Mm.

17:36.823 --> 17:40.260
- You saw me on TV.
You were curious.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.396
So you reached out
to talk about

17:43.430 --> 17:45.398
Bob Lee Swagger.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.600
Few drinks, few laughs...

Speaking of perception,

17:57.610 --> 17:58.778
I read your file,

17:58.811 --> 18:00.880
and I didn't see
anything exceptional

18:00.913 --> 18:03.650
about you, your performance,
or your instinct.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.753
In fact, you seem
like a barely average cop to me.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.188
- Uh, my file?

18:08.221 --> 18:09.822
- I was curious about you.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.692
You weren't scheduled
the day of the assassination,

18:12.725 --> 18:13.793
so why were you there?

18:13.826 --> 18:15.295
- The president was in town.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.630
If you're available,
you help out.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.866
Who the hell are you? IA?

18:19.899 --> 18:22.302
- No. You don't normally work
that area, do you?

18:22.335 --> 18:25.172
- I went where I could be
most helpful.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.374
And thank God I did.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.276

20:17.884 --> 20:20.387
- Ron, I didn't do it.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.390
You know me better.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.858
- I thought I did.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.728
War messes up people,

20:28.761 --> 20:29.929
especially you.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.264
- I was set up.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.465
I didn't do it, man.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.900
I'm giving you my word.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.768
- Your word?

20:35.802 --> 20:39.772
You know how many vets
commit suicide every day?

20:39.806 --> 20:41.741
We've got enough problems

20:41.774 --> 20:44.911
with our civilians looking at us
as crazy and dangerous.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.916
- Listen, man. I just need
to buy myself some time.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.884
[paper rustling]

20:51.918 --> 20:54.253
I need this, and you're
the one person I could ask.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.826
- I'll give you
a five-minute head-start

20:59.859 --> 21:02.862
out of respect
for the Bob Lee I used to know.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.832
- 22.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.737
The number of vets that commit
suicide every day is 22.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.038
Sorry I came here.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.936
It's what you asked for.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.973
I've altered your VA record
to match the serial number.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.476
- I didn't even think
about that.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.043
Thanks, Ron.
This is--

21:51.077 --> 21:52.445
- It's for the lives you saved.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.846
I figured someone owed you that.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.748
Now get out of here,
all right?

22:19.639 --> 22:22.108

Where are you going?

22:22.141 --> 22:23.976
The entrance is off-limits.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.146
- I got to go see my counselor.
I have a weekly appointment.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.481
I need to get in there.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.982
- Facility's on lockdown.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.551
You won't be able to enter
the grounds today.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.953
- Come on, man. I need
to see my counselor today.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.055
I've been prescribed this time.
You can't take it from me.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.126
Can I at least go in
and tell him I'm not coming?

22:40.159 --> 22:41.494
He's gonna worry.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.096
- Can't let you in, brother.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.865
You'll have
to leave the area now.

22:45.898 --> 22:46.899
I'm sorry.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.535
Yo, let him through.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.039
- Motorcycle cleared to exit.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.910
- Any sign of him
at the hospital?

22:57.944 --> 23:00.046
- Ugh, no. He made it out.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.515
- Guy's got the luck
of the Irish.

23:02.549 --> 23:05.051
What was he doing there, anyway?

23:05.084 --> 23:08.655
- Agent Memphis, your brother's
calling for you on line one.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.122
- Always wanted a brother.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.591
Never had one until now.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.430
Memphis.

23:17.464 --> 23:20.166
- Just give me one minute.
That's all I need.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.669
- What do you want?
- You talk to Timmons?

23:22.702 --> 23:24.937
- Yeah. I talked to him.
He was an asshole.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.173
I still didn't get anything
out of him.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.208
- He wasn't the guy
who shot at me.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.077
Okay? You got to dig deeper.

23:31.110 --> 23:34.146
- Okay. Give me something else,

23:34.180 --> 23:35.448
and I'll look into it.

23:35.482 --> 23:38.084
Or maybe you could come in,

23:38.117 --> 23:40.687
and we would have lots of time
to talk about our hero--

23:40.720 --> 23:41.854
[call ends]

23:44.256 --> 23:45.958
Hello?

23:45.992 --> 23:47.560
- God damn it.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.695
What did he say?

23:48.728 --> 23:51.564
- He's still stuck on Timmons.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.633
I'm starting to believe him.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.602
I mean, have you ever met a cop

23:55.635 --> 23:58.505
who happily worked overtime
for no pay?

23:58.538 --> 24:01.040
- Timmons isn't the story.
Stay on Swagger.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.509
He trusts you.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.544
He'll call again.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.078
- What did you tell her, Kyle?

24:08.014 --> 24:09.549
- Nothing.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.486
I didn't say nothing.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.588
- Why did she want
to talk to you?

24:15.622 --> 24:18.257
I mean, I know it's not
because she liked you,

24:18.290 --> 24:20.493
you drunk son of a bitch.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.562
So what did she want?

24:22.595 --> 24:26.165
- I-I'll tell you everything.
Just take this thing off me.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.034
- Uh...no.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.036
Now, what did she want?

24:30.069 --> 24:33.105
- She, uh, asked me if I--

24:33.139 --> 24:35.642
if I really shot Bob Lee.

24:35.675 --> 24:40.246
- Now why in the f---
would she ask you that?

24:40.279 --> 24:42.148
Oh, I know.
Because you have done

24:42.181 --> 24:44.216
nothing but shoot your mouth off
about it

24:44.250 --> 24:45.618
since the day it happened.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.688
- I had to act
like it was real,

24:48.721 --> 24:51.090
didn't I?

24:51.123 --> 24:52.091
I mean...

24:52.124 --> 24:53.693
[voice quivering]

24:53.726 --> 24:55.628
what was I supposed to do?

24:55.662 --> 24:57.597
- I don't know.
Shut up,

24:57.630 --> 25:00.266
not attract attention
to yourself until it was time.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.769
I've got no choice now, Kyle.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.037
I mean...

25:05.071 --> 25:07.640
this is gonna look bad.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.942
It's--you know, it's messy.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.111
- [crying]
No.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.217
Don't kill me.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.787
I didn't tell her anything.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.089
I wouldn't say anything
to anyone.

25:25.324 --> 25:28.027
- You see, your problem is,
Kyle,

25:28.060 --> 25:31.731
you don't inspire
a whole lot of confidence.

25:31.764 --> 25:32.799
- They won't believe you!

25:32.832 --> 25:34.967
Why would I kill myself?

25:35.001 --> 25:37.103
I'm a f--- hero.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.971
- For all the same reasons
we chose you:

25:39.005 --> 25:43.209
because you're an angry,
violent, abusive cop

25:43.242 --> 25:44.811
with a history of depression.

25:50.016 --> 25:50.182
.

25:50.216 --> 25:50.549
[door opening]

25:52.118 --> 25:53.686
- No. No, he was intimidated
by my job.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.688
That's not the same
as being married to my job.

25:55.722 --> 25:58.658
Those are two completely
different things.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.827
Yeah.

26:00.860 --> 26:04.363
I'm just gonna take a shower
and then eat something.

26:04.396 --> 26:07.700
I'll call you back
to say good night.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.102
Ugh, I'm not trying
to change the subject, Mom.

26:10.136 --> 26:13.272
I'm just--I don't know.
I'm hungry and I'm dirty.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.041
Let me just--
I'll call you back, okay?

26:15.074 --> 26:18.310
Okay. Mom. Okay.
Bye.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.146
[sighs]

26:21.413 --> 26:23.182
[gasps]

26:23.215 --> 26:26.152
- Thought we should talk
face-to-face.

26:26.185 --> 26:29.255
It'd take you two seconds to
get the gun back out and fire.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.757
I could hit you three times
by then.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.295
Found your spare in the kitchen.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.331
I'm not gonna hurt you.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.733
I need your help.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.169
- That's not the way to get it.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.671
- Nothing else is working.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.740
Could you just sit?

26:55.381 --> 26:57.349
Kyle Timmons was murdered
tonight.

26:57.383 --> 27:00.219
They're gonna say
it was suicide, but it wasn't.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.287
- How do you know this?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.322
- 'Cause I found his body.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.758
It wasn't me,
if that's what you're thinking.

27:05.792 --> 27:09.095
Timmons was the best chance
I had to prove my innocence.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.763
It only gets harder for me
from here.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.665
- Trouble just follows you,
I guess.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.266
- I didn't ask
for any of this.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.268
An old friend wanted my help,
and I gave it to him.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.770
That was my mistake.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.371
The friend was Isaac Johnson.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.709
- [scoffs]

27:22.742 --> 27:24.443
The story just keeps getting
better and better.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.312
First a bad cop.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.915
Now a Secret Service agent
with access to the president?

27:28.948 --> 27:30.917
- Isaac came to me with a story

27:30.950 --> 27:33.252
about someone trying
to assassinate the president.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.254
He asked me to help him
figure out the best location

27:35.287 --> 27:36.689
to take the shot.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.825
But he used my footprints
to frame me.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.394
- Look. Let me bring you in.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.463
If this is true,
you'll need protection.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.098
- I need to find
the actual shooter.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.867
Once I find him,
I'll know how they did it.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.737
As far as the Russian side,

27:50.770 --> 27:52.805
there's a journalist,
Kalyna Ordenko.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.340
She's been working
on a story about--

27:54.373 --> 27:55.742
- Red Hill.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.276
I know who she is.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.778
- Well, then you know
that her last article was

27:58.811 --> 28:00.312
published
the day of the assassination,

28:00.346 --> 28:02.248
and she hasn't been
heard from since.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.719
- So...

28:06.753 --> 28:10.222
Russians use Americans
to kill the Ukrainian president

28:10.256 --> 28:12.224
in order to what?

28:12.258 --> 28:13.425
Stage a coup?

28:13.459 --> 28:15.194
There are easier ways
to kill people.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.963
- Not if you want to make it
look like an accident.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.398
I don't know
what their objective is yet,

28:19.431 --> 28:21.934
but this took a coordinated
effort between the Russians

28:21.968 --> 28:23.870
and some very high-level people
in our government

28:23.903 --> 28:25.504
to pull this off.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.206
I'm innocent.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.741
I have a family that's scared.

28:28.775 --> 28:31.343
I'm one security camera away
from being killed.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.812
I need your help.

28:32.845 --> 28:36.282
- If I thought any of this
was credible,

28:36.315 --> 28:38.284
I would help you
in any way I could,

28:38.317 --> 28:40.186
but honestly,
you've got a lot of speculation,

28:40.219 --> 28:43.990
and still no proof
of a conspiracy.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.291
- No. You're wrong.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.327
I'm living proof.

- Agent Johnson.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.410
Do you remember the
Russian reporter Kalyna Ordenko,

30:11.443 --> 30:13.479
from the articles
Dimitri Voydian hid?

30:13.512 --> 30:14.480
The ones I showed you?

30:14.513 --> 30:16.482
- I remember.

30:16.515 --> 30:17.917
- Did you ever connect with her?

30:17.950 --> 30:20.486
I'm trying to close out
my Voydian file.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.321
I'm hoping she can give me
some background.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.056
- I think you're wasting
your time.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.625
I spoke to her. She didn't have
more intel than what she wrote.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.995
- When did you talk to her?
- Sometime last week.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.362
- Well, I should still try.

30:30.396 --> 30:31.898
What number
did you reach her at?

30:31.931 --> 30:33.499
- She called me.

30:33.532 --> 30:36.068
- Oh. Okay.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.336
Saves me some work.

30:37.369 --> 30:38.837
- Any Swagger updates?

30:40.907 --> 30:42.641
- No. Uh, nothing.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.276
- Okay. Let's get started.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.567
- It's $3.25.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.538
[tense music]

31:12.571 --> 31:19.578
*

31:22.448 --> 31:24.683
Yeah, I think the man on the
front page of the newspaper

31:24.716 --> 31:26.052
just left my store.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.022
- Hey. I'll have my office
try to locate

31:30.056 --> 31:31.657
that reporter's contact info.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.559
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.693
- If you don't mind me asking,

31:34.726 --> 31:36.128
what information
are you looking for?

31:36.162 --> 31:37.463
- Mr. Utey.
- What's up?

31:37.496 --> 31:39.598
- We found Swagger.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.700
- It's him.
The camera quality sucks,

31:41.733 --> 31:43.169
but it's definitely Swagger.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.704
- It's out of character for him.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.573
He's been cautious.
Why would he stop caring

31:47.606 --> 31:48.707
about being seen now?

31:48.740 --> 31:50.442
- I'll ask him
when I arrest him.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.444
Look. This town is only
a little more than an hour out

31:52.478 --> 31:54.446
on the west side of Mt. Baker.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.082
- We got to be smart about this.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.050
Mt. Baker covers thousands
of miles of forest.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.651
Swagger gets lost
in those trees,

31:59.685 --> 32:02.354
it could take us months
to get him back out.

32:02.388 --> 32:03.555
- Wait, wait, wait.
You really want

32:03.589 --> 32:05.524
to drag our feet
and miss our chance?

32:05.557 --> 32:08.560
- Does he have friends up there?
Property?

32:08.594 --> 32:10.696
Let's find out before we go
rushing up the mountain,

32:10.729 --> 32:12.564
letting everyone, including him,
know we're coming.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.467
- Either way, we have to be
prepared for a big engagement.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.603
- I think I might know
a better way.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.473
He was at the
Johnson Country Store

32:21.507 --> 32:22.674
in Mt. Baker
less than an hour ago.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.110
Get your men and get out there.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.178
- Mt. Baker?
[scoffs]

32:26.212 --> 32:28.680
Well, he should be
easy to find there.

32:28.714 --> 32:29.681
- I'll give you the location
when I have it.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.417
Just get out there now.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.185
- We know where he is.
What's the rush?

32:33.219 --> 32:35.654
- The intel came from the FBI.
Do I really need to remind you

32:35.687 --> 32:38.624
why we have to get to him first?

32:38.657 --> 32:40.626
- You ever been to a church?

32:40.659 --> 32:42.228
- Why?

32:42.261 --> 32:45.397
- No reason.
Call me with the coordinates.

32:45.431 --> 32:52.438
*

33:01.713 --> 33:03.415
- Hey! No.
You can't come in here.

33:03.449 --> 33:04.783
- Where's Mary?
- She's with her aunt.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.652
What the hell are you doing?

33:06.685 --> 33:09.655
You can't just come in here
like this.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.791
- Mt. Baker.
Who does he know?

33:12.824 --> 33:14.593
I'm trying
to save Bob Lee's life.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.228
- Don't bullshit me.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.697
We both know the truth.

33:18.730 --> 33:21.467
- Tell me exactly where
I can find him on Mt. Baker.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.535
I'll arrest you
as a material witness.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.804
I will swear that your sister
is colluding with you,

33:25.837 --> 33:28.140
and then I will personally
take your daughter away.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.511
- Bob Lee always thought
you were a coward.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.580
I think he was being kind.

33:34.613 --> 33:35.714
- Your choice.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.651
[dialing]

33:40.852 --> 33:42.621
- Hang up.

33:42.654 --> 33:43.722
Hang up!

33:47.793 --> 33:50.296
He had an old friend
up there with a cabin

33:50.329 --> 33:51.497
who said he could use it
whenever he wanted,

33:51.530 --> 33:53.132
but this was years ago.

33:53.165 --> 33:54.666
I don't even know
if his friend is still alive.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.202
- What's his name?
- What if I'm wrong?

33:56.235 --> 33:58.204
What if he's not there?

33:58.237 --> 34:00.539
Look. I'm telling you the truth.
I don't want my husband killed.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.040
- What is his friend's name?

34:04.876 --> 34:06.478
- Eric Ponder.

34:13.619 --> 34:16.255
[door closes]

34:16.288 --> 34:19.258
[dark music]

34:19.291 --> 34:20.492
*

34:20.526 --> 34:21.793
- Stop.

34:22.794 --> 34:29.801
*

34:32.638 --> 34:33.772
This don't feel right.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.844
I'm calling an audible.
We're out of here.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.812
- You're really gonna
let Johnson just walk into this?

34:40.846 --> 34:43.815
- One of the best snipers in the
world is out there with a rifle

34:43.849 --> 34:46.218
that's probably pointed at you
right now.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.220
- I'm not dying for him today.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.626
- He's in the woods.
- I'm sorry. I'm not clear

34:54.660 --> 34:56.195
about what you're saying.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.896
Has your schedule changed
since we last spoke?

34:57.929 --> 35:01.167
- [laughs] Yeah. Yeah.
My schedule changed.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.635
And you might want
to adjust yours, too,

35:03.669 --> 35:06.905
because it's turning out to be
a killer of a day.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.240
Good luck.

35:08.274 --> 35:11.243
[dramatic music]

35:11.277 --> 35:18.284
*

35:28.294 --> 35:35.301
*

35:39.305 --> 35:42.374
- You want to give him
a chance to give up?

35:42.408 --> 35:44.810
- If he wanted
to give himself up, he would've.

35:44.843 --> 35:51.817
*

35:51.850 --> 35:54.820
[quiet, eerie music]

35:54.853 --> 36:01.860
*

36:06.765 --> 36:08.600
- All clear.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.603
[eerie music and noises]

36:11.637 --> 36:18.644
*

36:34.660 --> 36:36.395
[dramatic music]

36:36.428 --> 36:38.864
[gunshots]

36:38.897 --> 36:40.632
- Jesus Christ.
He brought us here to kill us.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.805
- Johnson,
I'd move if I were you.

36:49.375 --> 36:52.744
- One of the boots thinks
he saw a flash. Eleven o'clock.

36:52.778 --> 36:55.647
- Have your men watching.
I'm gonna give him a shot.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.018
[gunshot]
- Let's wait him out.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.787
He's not going anywhere.

37:01.820 --> 37:07.493
*

37:07.526 --> 37:08.494
[gunshot]

37:08.527 --> 37:13.965

[heart beating]

37:28.947 --> 37:29.981
[gunshot]

37:36.955 --> 37:40.392
- Jesus Christ.
What a mess.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.861
- Why would Swagger wear
a suicide vest anyway?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.463
- What the hell was he thinking?

37:44.496 --> 37:45.764
- He was probably thinking
he didn't want

37:45.797 --> 37:47.999
to go back to prison.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.435
- Bag this.
Let's spread out.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.002
We need to find proof
that he's dead.

37:51.036 --> 37:55.341
- Agent Johnson, you'd better
take a look at this.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.509
Appears to be hair and skull
fragment, sir.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.745
- What is that?

37:59.778 --> 38:01.279
- It's a titanium hip.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.952
- So that's it then?

38:06.985 --> 38:08.820
- This will make it easier
to confirm.

38:08.854 --> 38:11.089
There's a serial number on here
that should match Bob Lee's.

38:11.122 --> 38:14.726
- Congratulations.
We got him.

38:36.748 --> 38:37.048
.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.784
- Is Daddy dead?

38:45.424 --> 38:47.459
- Listen, mouse.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.661
We have to believe in Daddy.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.531
We have to keep our hope up

38:52.564 --> 38:54.733
and pray for his safe return.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.439
Do you--do you remember
the story

39:00.472 --> 39:02.508
Daddy told you about Musa Qala?

39:02.541 --> 39:05.110
- Yes.
- Yeah? What happened there?

39:05.143 --> 39:08.046
- Daddy saved Isaac's life.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.518
- Daddy wanted you to remember
that story.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.654
I'm not sure why, but he did.

39:22.561 --> 39:25.864
- Saving Isaac wasn't
the best part.

39:25.897 --> 39:28.767
- No? What was the best part?

39:28.800 --> 39:31.437
- Daddy had to be a ghost.

39:37.142 --> 39:40.479
[Jordan Max's "Hell"]

39:40.512 --> 39:43.114
- Bag everything.
Don't leave anything behind.

square inch of this board.

40:13.645 --> 40:15.213
Take the pieces down carefully.

to play with fire *

40:56.254 --> 40:57.789
You can either tell everyone
I'm still alive,

40:57.823 --> 40:59.525
or you can trust your gut

40:59.558 --> 41:00.992
and let me keep trying
to figure this thing out.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.695
- Last time I trusted my gut,
someone got killed.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.664

I'm already dead.
