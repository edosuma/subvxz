WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:04.105
Good morning, DiMeos.

00:05.406 --> 00:06.874
Good morning, Pepper.
Whoa.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.942
Welcome, Kenneth.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.678
Pepper's sorting us
by gender.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.547
-Don't know. But it was

00:13.647 --> 00:15.383
important enough to start at
5:00 this morning.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.385
Pepper's been showing us
all he learned

00:17.485 --> 00:19.019
in his service dog
training.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.523
He can undress JJ.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.693
He brings us food.

00:25.793 --> 00:26.960
He gets the lights.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.862
Oh, thanks, Pepper.

00:28.962 --> 00:32.032
He even helps you
when you get anxious.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.801
But he's also been showing us

00:33.901 --> 00:35.636
why he got kicked out
of the program.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.572
Please, not again.
I want them on.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.809
Pepper has his own plans --
for our clothes...

00:41.909 --> 00:44.212
Pepper, please.
I hate bananas.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.879
...for what we eat,

00:45.979 --> 00:47.415
and for our sanity.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.417
I'll tell you anything

00:49.517 --> 00:50.618
you want to know, Pepper!

00:50.718 --> 00:51.885
Just make it stop!

00:51.985 --> 00:54.222
Drool makes me anxious.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.824
So he's got some skills,

00:56.924 --> 01:00.094
but a frustrating inability
to play by the rules.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.995
This dog is a DiMeo.

01:03.964 --> 01:06.867
No, Pepper! Not the lights!
Stop it!

01:06.967 --> 01:09.570
It's not so easy, is it?

01:13.341 --> 01:15.276
Come here, Pepper.
Come here, poochie-poo.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.811
Hey, Pepper. Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

01:17.911 --> 01:18.946
Wait.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.681
I'm the one
who wanted him.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.450
Why does he like everyone
more than me?

01:22.550 --> 01:25.353
I don't know.
It just feels nice to get a win.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.957
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.

01:30.057 --> 01:32.926
Whoa. This is --

01:33.026 --> 01:34.362
White. Yeah.

01:34.462 --> 01:35.963
JJ's got that big
New Year's Party.

01:36.063 --> 01:39.066
So he wanted to explore some
creative dancing strategies.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.235
How much are we paying you
for these sessions?

01:41.335 --> 01:42.703
For the last six weeks,
nothing.

01:42.803 --> 01:43.804
Dance on!

01:43.904 --> 01:45.306
Oh, actually,
I should get going.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.142
Lost track of time.
Almost gave you your whole hour.

01:48.242 --> 01:53.714
So, the Double J's got
a really exciting night out.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.048
Hey, what about you, Jimmy?

01:55.149 --> 01:56.317
Uh, what do you got
planned?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.486
I might be exploring
some creative

01:58.586 --> 02:00.554
dancing strategies
of my own.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.223
I'm spending the night
out on the town with Maya.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.458
Good for you, buddy.
You two never get time alone.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.860
* Jimmy's gonna get
some lovin' *

02:06.960 --> 02:09.297
* Jimmy's gonna
get some lovin' *

02:09.830 --> 02:12.366
That was disrespectful.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.235
* Maya's gonna get
some lovin' *

02:14.335 --> 02:16.003
Stop your bawdy
playfulness.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.706
Jimmy, I've been thinking
about tomorrow night,

02:18.806 --> 02:19.840
our night together.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.141
It's going to be great.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.343
I totally agree
with the need for it.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.744
I'd like you to go alone.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.013
No! We are going out
together.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.648
Yeah, but what if they need us?
What if JJ needs us?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.116
What if there's a fire?

02:29.217 --> 02:30.918
Why would there be a fire?
Because of the earthquake.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.821
Something's gonna happen, Jimmy.
It always does.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.389
Come on.
It's New Year's Eve.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.690
When was the last time
you and I

02:36.790 --> 02:40.093
spent New Year's Eve together,
just us?

02:40.194 --> 02:43.096
Oh, I don't answer questions
that prove someone else's point.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.998
KENNETH: Well, you sure do
deserve it.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.100
Ring in the new year,
have some fun.

02:47.201 --> 02:50.204
Yeah! So, what
are we doing tomorrow?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.605
We?

02:51.705 --> 02:54.542
Uh, we don't have plans
tomorrow.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.377
Uh...we do.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.878
We made a plan this summer,
you canceled,

02:57.978 --> 02:59.179
but promised to to reschedule,

02:59.280 --> 03:00.614
we made plans again,
then you canceled those,

03:00.714 --> 03:02.783
I said, "You're not just
gonna keep canceling

03:02.883 --> 03:04.485
and never actually do
it, right?"

03:04.585 --> 03:06.119
And you said, "Me? Nah!"

03:06.220 --> 03:08.222
And I said, "So when are we
going?" And you said, "Ya know,

03:08.322 --> 03:11.492
in a bit." And I said, "Okay,
but this year, right?"

03:11.592 --> 03:15.563
And you said, "Of course!"
And the year ends tomorrow.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.765
* Kenneth's gonna get
some lovin' *

03:17.865 --> 03:19.333
* Kenneth's gonna
get some lo-- *
Stop it!

03:19.433 --> 03:22.403
Okay. Well, uh,
I guess you and I

03:22.503 --> 03:26.907
will be spending
New Year's Eve...together.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.043
Mm.

03:30.143 --> 03:33.614
Pepper!
What is your deal?

03:33.714 --> 03:36.016
You're supposed to be
my weird dog.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.184
Sit on me.

03:37.285 --> 03:41.088
In a minute.
I need this.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.556
'Sup, Ray?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.425
Oh, hi,
I was just leaving.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.194
Oh, I'm so sorry, Justin, I must
have accidentally told you

03:47.295 --> 03:49.430
to come too early,
and now you have to

03:49.530 --> 03:52.266
stand there and see my
girlfriend kiss me goodbye.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.234
Aah! What a scheduling
nightmare.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.236
Sorry.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.674
Bye, Justin. Happy New Year.
You too.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.075
What do you two
have planned for tomorrow?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.977
Oh, my friend's parents
are out of town,

04:04.077 --> 04:05.313
so we're going on her boat.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.480
It's just gonna
be a small thing,

04:06.580 --> 04:07.748
really intimate.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.917
It's gonna be
a special night.

04:11.419 --> 04:15.122
What a joy that woman is.
Dude. She's gonna
eat you alive!

04:15.222 --> 04:17.325
What?
A "special night"

04:17.425 --> 04:18.759
on a boat with no parents?

04:18.859 --> 04:21.595
There's gonna be some motion
on that ocean!

04:21.695 --> 04:23.130
You ready
to rock her world?

04:23.230 --> 04:24.432
Psssh. Yeah.

04:24.532 --> 04:27.134
I-I'm about to get
boisterous on that girl.

04:27.234 --> 04:31.204
It's gonna be so crazy,
I'm gonna get pregnant.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.773
But for the sake of
conversation,

04:32.873 --> 04:35.743
wouldn't it be funny
if I were actually super nervous

04:35.843 --> 04:37.177
about all that stuff?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.279
Like, not ready
for any of it?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.382
I guess
that's kind of humorous.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.883
And what would you
tell a guy like that?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.252
Would you tell him to be honest
with his girlfriend?

04:45.353 --> 04:48.389
Oh, definitely not.
She would laugh in his face,

04:48.489 --> 04:50.157
dump him, and then go hit up
his friends.

04:50.257 --> 04:53.661
Oh, yeah, he'd deserve it.
That jerk.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.896
But you don't have to worry
about that guy,

04:55.996 --> 04:57.898
because you're
"All the way Ray"!

04:57.998 --> 05:01.134
Mothers,
lock up your daughters.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.939
What's this doing here?

05:06.039 --> 05:09.643
Not sure. Unrelated, something's
wrong with JJ's wheelchair.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.513
The housing snapped off,
and there's no way to fix it.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.748
He can't go out in this.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.686
"Great. No party for me.
I'll stay home."

05:18.786 --> 05:21.121
See, Jimmy?
Something always comes up.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.990
We'll stay home, too.
-Noooo!

05:23.090 --> 05:25.192
Too dramatic. I'm sorry.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.228
I've gamed out every scenario
for tonight in my mind.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.530
If we leave him alone,

05:29.630 --> 05:31.932
there's a 100% chance
he'll die.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.001
"Don't cancel your plans.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.871
You..." D-E--
"deserve a night out."

05:37.971 --> 05:40.073
Fine, you guilted me!

05:40.173 --> 05:41.809
Taylor and I will just stay here
with you, JJ.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.478
So long,
romantic boat party.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.146
DYLAN: You don't have to stay.
I'm gonna be here

05:46.246 --> 05:48.215
bonding with
my best bud, Pepper.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.853
Ha! Psych!

05:52.953 --> 05:55.523
Got me that time,
best bud.

05:56.156 --> 06:00.327
Wait. Dylan and the dog
are gonna be here, too?

06:00.428 --> 06:01.929
That means
I won't be able to do

06:02.029 --> 06:04.231
any of the things
I'm comfortable with.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.734
See? The kids will all be
together. They'll be fine.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.169
I won't be able to relax.
We can't go out.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.704
Okay.

06:10.804 --> 06:11.939
We can still have
a fun night.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.140
Let's go get some
party supplies.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.341
We'll be back
in a minute, kids.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.076
Yeah, I need my keys.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.377
Uh, Pepper! Keys!

06:17.478 --> 06:21.415
Ohhhh! Weird boy.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.683
So weird.

06:22.783 --> 06:26.420
Dude, I heard you
with your friend before.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.889
If you're nervous
about this Taylor stuff,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.357
be straight with her.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.059
Staying here and surrounding
yourself with people

06:32.159 --> 06:33.727
is a really dumb plan.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.430
Look, I don't know what you
think you heard...but ya didn't.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.066
Hmm.
You're just not down
with the lingo.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.970
See, when we teens
say something is "bad,"

06:43.070 --> 06:45.706
we actually mean
it's good, ya dig?

06:45.806 --> 06:47.407
Okay, let me try again.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.676
Uh, your plan
is very bad.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.411
See?
Now you're getting it!

06:51.745 --> 06:54.915
Ha ha! Too slow.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.251
Well, goodbye, party shirt.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.854
Hello,
party supply buying shirt.

07:00.954 --> 07:01.989
Darling, don't hate me.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.624
You know,
it's just our life.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.892
We don't get to take
the night off.

07:04.992 --> 07:08.428
I know about our life.
I love our life.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.797
We've been thrown
some curve balls,

07:09.897 --> 07:11.799
stuff that blows
a lot of weaker people up.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.101
Stuff that blows
a lot of strong people up.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.803
And we're good.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.105
That's worth celebrating.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.907
**

07:20.007 --> 07:21.975
You know what?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.314
Ahh.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.249
You're not gonna react to that?
I changed my mind.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.652
Oh! Well, that's
how you always drive.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.521
I didn't realize.
Great, great.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.988
You know the bar
is back that way?

07:45.265 --> 07:49.102
I'm sorry you're
stuck here all night.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.338
"It's..." N-- "New Year's.

07:51.438 --> 07:55.308
I wanted some..." E-X--
"excitement."

07:55.408 --> 07:57.845
-Huh!

07:59.412 --> 08:02.349
Well, I'm around
if you need me.

08:02.449 --> 08:06.086
Just gonna be spending quality
time with a dog who loves me.

08:06.186 --> 08:09.523
C'mere, c'mere.

08:11.525 --> 08:15.963
Don't run after him.
Show some self-respect.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.330
This is an unrelated run!

08:17.430 --> 08:21.301
Come back, Pepper! Come back!

08:21.401 --> 08:24.237
Hi. Happy New Year.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.708
Hello, ma'am.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.843
Hi, JJ.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.411
Sorry for the change
of plans.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.214
I was really excited
for a romantic evening, but --

08:34.314 --> 08:36.383
I don't know --
it just didn't feel right

08:36.483 --> 08:38.018
to go out when JJ
couldn't.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.453
Oh, I understand.
That's so sweet.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.056
And don't worry.
We can have plenty of fun later.

08:43.156 --> 08:46.093
That seems insensitive to JJ.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.896
Please help yourself
to a refreshment.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.932
-Hey, everyone.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.366
Yeah.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.937
What? Don't you remember your
parents begging me

08:57.037 --> 09:00.273
to cancel my big plans with
Joyce to come watch you guys?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.509
Not gonna sugarcoat it,
I am very unhappy

09:02.610 --> 09:05.112
to see you people
off the clock.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.148
This sucks.
I'll be in the kitchen.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.818
I thought you said
surrounding myself with people

09:10.918 --> 09:12.219
was a very dumb plan.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.723
That's weird, because your plan
seems awfully similar.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.424
Ray, now is not the time
to nitpick.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.527
Now is the time to foster
a sexless environment.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.695
Think you can do that?

09:21.795 --> 09:24.865
Astronomy club in the house!

09:24.965 --> 09:27.267
Who wants to play
"San Diego

09:27.367 --> 09:28.501
I'm in.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.037
-Hey, hey, hey!

09:30.137 --> 09:32.339
Oh, I came
to the right place.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.644
Well, I told the kids
we would be out for the night,

09:36.744 --> 09:37.945
and they were fine.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.512
Ray seemed a bit
disappointed, though.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.581
He said something about
needing us to be a buffer.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.416
I didn't understand.
That was very sweet.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.085
I like this place.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.386
Yeah. It sort of
reminds me

09:46.486 --> 09:47.921
of that bar we used to go to
in New York.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.624
Do you remember they'd serve
those giant balls

09:50.724 --> 09:52.392
of toxic,
fruity rum drinks?

09:52.492 --> 09:54.762
I think we spent our first
New Year's together there.

09:54.862 --> 09:55.796
Did we?

09:55.896 --> 10:00.433
Oh, Jimmy,
you're so romantic.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.469
* Jimmy's gonna
get some lovin' *
That's true. I am.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.504
* Jimmy's gonna get
some lovin' *

10:06.539 --> 10:07.775
Oh, no! Darling!

10:07.875 --> 10:09.142
Who's driving home?

10:09.242 --> 10:11.278
A cab. Or my mom.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.580
You know, she always said that
if I ever had too much to drink,

10:13.681 --> 10:16.083
she'd come and get me,
no questions asked.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.550
To us.
All right.

10:17.651 --> 10:21.154
We don't do this,
so when we do this, we do this.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.223
Oh, you are scary
when you're fun.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.424
Hmm. To us.

10:24.524 --> 10:27.494
Aah! That was too strong.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.162
Yeah.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.931
- * Ohhhh

10:31.031 --> 10:34.501
Just a wholesome New Year's Eve
like the olden days.

10:34.601 --> 10:35.836
JJ, you good over there?

10:38.105 --> 10:39.907
-Uh...

10:40.007 --> 10:42.109
-Oh, hi.
-Taylor, we're gonna go to

10:42.209 --> 10:43.343
Shelby's house, and we were --

10:43.443 --> 10:45.979
There's boys here!

10:46.079 --> 10:48.348
Whoa. This game's
only for four players.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.784
You have bad skin,
but you're cute.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.220
Dude! What the hell
is going on?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.956
Taylor and her friends go
to an all-girls' school.

10:56.056 --> 10:59.459
Any boy to them is like
a water fountain in the desert.

10:59.559 --> 11:03.363
Oh! Oh. That explains a lot
about you and Taylor, too.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.432
No, because we...

11:05.532 --> 11:07.200
-See, we met...

11:08.501 --> 11:09.937
One problem
at a time, Kenneth!

11:10.037 --> 11:12.840
Oh, look at these
young lovebirds.

11:12.940 --> 11:16.710
How 'bout we two crusty veterans
show 'em how it's done?

11:16.810 --> 11:20.714
Actually, uh, Kenneth
was just about to show me

11:20.814 --> 11:22.515
the pustule on his foot.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.552
Uh, yeah.
I want to see if it looks like

11:25.652 --> 11:27.320
the pustule on Ray's thigh.
Oh, hey, Taylor.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.222
You got any questions
for the pustule brothers?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.992
Does the question have to be
about pustules?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.294
-it's preferred.
-Yeah, pre...ferred.

11:34.394 --> 11:38.365
Hey, can I sit here?
Okay, great.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.968
My boyfriend
is such a jerk.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.804
He went to Burrito Burrito
without me and posted a picture.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.305
He knows it's my favorite
restaurant.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.274
I mean, he doesn't even like it.
He says the fiesta sauce

11:47.374 --> 11:48.809
is too tangy.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.543
I'm sorry for venting.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.980
I mean, you can leave if you
don't want to hear this.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.315
Have you ever loved someone who
brings you nothing but pain?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.584
Why was he
at Burrito Burrito?!

12:02.455 --> 12:04.391
Oh, my God.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.392
How many bowls is that?

12:05.492 --> 12:08.495
Hang on. One. And. Two.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.430
Math. Very cool!

12:10.530 --> 12:13.366
Ah! My drunkenness level has
reached "karaoke."

12:13.466 --> 12:16.136
But that bloke's been hogging
the mic for half an hour!

12:16.236 --> 12:19.973
That is a karaoke no-no.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.909
Ha! Wait. You're a band.
Carry on.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.377
Pssh! You said you wanted
tonight to be epic.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.979
I don't recall saying that.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.282
Ah! Yes, you do.
It's my turn, buddy.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.353
If these girls can flirt
with Ray's band of zeroes,

12:33.453 --> 12:35.322
you can at least
sit next to me.

12:37.724 --> 12:41.228
Seriously?
Is something wrong with me?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.530
Anyway, those are
the six reasons

12:43.630 --> 12:46.033
why I'll probably
return my turtle.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.367
How did we even start
talking about this?

12:47.467 --> 12:49.837
Oh! Right. I got
the turtle because

12:49.937 --> 12:51.238
stupid Xander's
allergic to everything else.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.073
Except apparently
Burrito Burrito.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.076
I can't believe
you remembered all that.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.346
You are such
a good listener.

12:59.446 --> 13:03.416
I can't remember the last time
I dated a good listener.

13:03.516 --> 13:07.420
Are good listeners
also good kissers?

13:11.758 --> 13:14.895
ALL: Spin the dog!
Spin the dog!

13:16.063 --> 13:18.765
ALL: Oh!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

13:18.866 --> 13:21.501
Here's a thought --
does anyone want to watch

13:21.601 --> 13:24.604
Ken Burns' 10-part
Vietnam War documentary?

13:24.704 --> 13:27.474
The New York Times
calls it his saddest film.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.676
Ray, there is a time
and place for documentaries,

13:29.776 --> 13:31.845
and this is not it.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.146
-Kenneth!
-Ray!

13:33.246 --> 13:35.782
Oh! There you are.
Let's do this, Ray.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.384
There's no point in having
the same rash

13:37.484 --> 13:39.987
if we're not gonna put
cream on each other.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.524
Do you get the feeling
they're trying to ditch us?

13:44.624 --> 13:46.426
This is gonna happen
in your life.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.362
Men are threatened by a woman
with strong sexual energy.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.199
-You threaten them even more.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.302
Who turned
off the lights?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.339
The power's out.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.009
Wait.
This is a good thing.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.944
Darkness will kill
the party.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.378
YOUNG MAN: I can't see.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.548
Looks like I'm gonna have to
feel my way around.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.084
-Ugh! Teens.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.654
Are you like a really old person
trapped in this body?

14:14.754 --> 14:17.357
* You're a heartbreaker,
dream maker, love taker *

14:17.457 --> 14:21.428
* Love taker, don't you
mess around, no, no, no! *

14:21.528 --> 14:22.963
MAN: Get off the stage!
We want the singer!

14:23.063 --> 14:25.598
-That's fair.
-Go on, order us another one.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.202
-Sure.
-May we please have minus three

14:29.302 --> 14:31.571
scorpion bowls please?

14:31.671 --> 14:34.307
Uh-oh. Wait. It's Ray.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.043
Do we know a Ray?

14:36.143 --> 14:38.578
Hold my shoe.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.280
Oh!
Speaking.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.715
All smooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.051
Hold on, hold on.
Oh, no.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.252
Uh, the power's out
at the house.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.754
They need us.
Not us, but, like,

14:47.854 --> 14:50.123
the version of us
that can feel our legs.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.659
Darling, it's Mommy.
Yeah, don't worry.
Everything's fine.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.161
Okay, the flashlights
are above the fridge.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.595
Dig them out, sit tight,

14:55.695 --> 14:57.931
and just tell everybody
we're on our way home. Okay?

14:58.031 --> 15:00.533
You're not drunk!

15:01.068 --> 15:03.971
You tricked me.

15:04.071 --> 15:08.108
There wasn't any alcohol
in these.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.346
I drank it all,

15:13.446 --> 15:14.747
and that is
how you tricked me.

15:24.091 --> 15:24.958
What is this?

15:25.058 --> 15:28.628
Strip "San Diego-opoly,"
baby!

15:28.728 --> 15:29.796
I dare you
to play with us.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.098
We're also playing
truth or dare.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.666
Actually, I think
Kenneth wants to --

15:33.766 --> 15:35.802
Strip with teens?
Oh, no, he doesn't.

15:35.902 --> 15:39.272
And shenanigans aside, I'd like
to be very clear about that.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.640
Maddie?!

15:40.740 --> 15:43.643
-No way! Xander!

15:43.743 --> 15:45.578
Who is this guy?

15:45.678 --> 15:47.047
He never said his name.
But he means

15:47.147 --> 15:50.150
more to me now
than you have or ever will.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.318
Tell him, guy.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.753
Go ahead.
Tell me, guy.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.989
Harumph.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.658
Is that a sound I make
when I'm upset?

15:58.758 --> 16:00.827
I don't remember a time
before I was drunk.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.862
Why are you upset?
It's a good thing

16:02.962 --> 16:05.165
I stayed sober in case
something came up

16:05.265 --> 16:06.166
because something did.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.600
You betrayed me!

16:07.700 --> 16:09.336
Were you even really laughing

16:09.436 --> 16:11.004
at my Forrest Gump
impression?

16:11.104 --> 16:12.605
Yeah, I've never seen
"Forrest Gump."

16:12.705 --> 16:14.241
What?!

16:15.442 --> 16:17.644
Hi, Ray.
We're on our way home.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.512
Come quick.
Dylan is missing,

16:19.612 --> 16:21.681
some big guy is about
to beat up JJ,

16:21.781 --> 16:24.484
and the darkness is making
things extremely randy.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.386
Dylan's missing?!
Yes, but I feel like

16:26.486 --> 16:28.821
the headline
is the randy atmosphere.

16:28.921 --> 16:32.525
If you treasure my innocence,
drive fast.

16:32.625 --> 16:36.229
Ray, we have someone
in the car with us.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.397
Forrest Gump.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.332
Would you
like to talk to him?

16:39.432 --> 16:40.433
God, no.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.634
Aw, come on, he's good!

16:47.640 --> 16:51.378
You found me.
You do care.

16:51.478 --> 16:55.382
Wait, how did you
even get up here?

16:55.482 --> 16:57.317
Hmm, doesn't matter.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.087
Hold on a second. So you

17:00.187 --> 17:03.956
didn't care until
I needed you, is that it?

17:04.057 --> 17:05.625
Just playing it too cool.

17:05.725 --> 17:10.797
Well, I try to come off
all tough, but I hurt, too.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.767
That's better.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.871
What's up, guy? Awful quiet.
You were talking a lot

17:18.971 --> 17:20.573
when you tried to get
with my girlfriend.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.143
Go ahead and fight him.
He'll beat your ass.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.045
He knows you don't
deserve me. Right, guy?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.580
If you don't beg for
forgiveness,

17:27.680 --> 17:31.418
I'm gonna destroy you.
One...two...

17:31.518 --> 17:33.353
What, do you think
I'm bluffing?!

17:36.089 --> 17:40.493
You're right.
I am, and I don't deserve you.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.229
But I want to.

17:42.329 --> 17:48.268
But like guy said, it's never
too late to start trying.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.869
Thanks, guy.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.772
Yeah, man.
You're the best.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.874
I thought
she'd never leave.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.809
Mind if I sit here?

17:56.909 --> 18:01.080
Hmm.
Strong, silent type.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.252
20 minutes to midnight.
If we keep playing interference,

18:05.352 --> 18:07.019
we might make it
to the new year unkissed.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.422
We have weird goals
sometimes.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.557
Yeah.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.560
Oh.
Ray, we need to talk.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.794
I'll leave the three
of you to it.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.129
-Mm.
-Mm-mm!

18:16.229 --> 18:17.430
What's going on with you?

18:17.530 --> 18:18.931
Either you're trying
to set me up

18:19.031 --> 18:20.567
with Kenneth or you're avoiding
being alone with me.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.303
Kenneth does
have his charms...
Ray,

18:23.403 --> 18:25.938
we said that we would always
be honest with each other

18:26.038 --> 18:27.640
about two things --
our feelings

18:27.740 --> 18:29.476
and our chances of getting
into top-tier colleges.

18:29.576 --> 18:33.045
And tonight, I'm sorry,
but I'm giving you a Skidmore.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.615
I'm sorry!

18:35.715 --> 18:37.750
I know guys are always
supposed to be ready

18:37.850 --> 18:40.119
and pushing it
and "Ooh, hubba-hubba."

18:40.220 --> 18:42.989
But I'm not like that.
And I can get uncomfortable

18:43.089 --> 18:44.857
with all the --
mwah, mwah, mwah.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.126
Yeah, I think we're all
uncomfortable with that.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.596
That's why
you're being so weird?

18:49.696 --> 18:51.998
Ray, it's fine.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.201
No! That is not
what you told me.

18:54.301 --> 18:58.004
Ray, this is a woman.
A woman with desires.

18:58.104 --> 19:01.774
She needs to be kissed
and kissed good

19:01.874 --> 19:03.276
by someone who knows how,

19:03.376 --> 19:05.345
instead of chasing him all over
some kid party, Kenneth.

19:05.445 --> 19:10.917
And if you're worried about
how to do it, here. Watch this.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.320
Mm!

19:14.454 --> 19:16.423
Mm!

19:18.758 --> 19:21.127
Should be something there
you can use.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.765
W-W-W-Where
are you going, girl?

19:25.865 --> 19:27.834
I-I think you just changed
our dynamic.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.303
Honey?

19:30.403 --> 19:33.540
So it's fine.
We can slow things...

19:37.710 --> 19:41.214
How was it?
Be honest.

19:42.649 --> 19:43.516
I have notes.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.618
Yes! I love notes!

19:45.718 --> 19:47.387
We're back!
Stop what you're doing.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.721
Who's bothering JJ?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.890
No? Oh, good.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.692
Must have been
quite a boring evening.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.126
Do you want me
to get you off the sofa?

19:54.227 --> 19:56.729
This guy's advice is gonna
change your life.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.366
He is so deep.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.500
Hi.
-Hey.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.602
**

20:02.702 --> 20:03.936
Well, then,
let's find Dylan.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.206
I'm here, Mom.
Pepper rescued me.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.876
From the pride
I wore like armor.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.314
That's gonna keep him busy for
a while. What about Ray?

20:14.414 --> 20:16.916
Oh, I'm fine. I've just got to
use my tongue a little less.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.718
Now we just need
to find JJ.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.387
And if he's good,
then they're all good.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.721
Jimmy, we did him first.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.423
Well, I forgot!

20:23.523 --> 20:24.924
Mom, we're all fine.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.126
You are.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.262
Yeah, you figured
it all out yourselves.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.433
Do you know what?
We do deserve to relax.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.602
Maybe let go a little bit.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.405
I mean, not you.
You've let go quite enough.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.908
But I can.
And starting now, I'm gonna try.

20:42.008 --> 20:45.244
Not until we find Ray.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.680
Ray!

20:51.584 --> 20:52.952
Is everyone ready?
Here it comes.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.521
ALL: Ten! Nine! Eight!
-JIMMY: Eleven! Twelve!

20:54.621 --> 20:55.588
-Other way!
-Seven! Six!

20:55.688 --> 20:57.156
I don't know
what we're doing.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.458
Five! Four! Three!

20:58.558 --> 21:02.395
Too cool to count down?
That's so hot.

21:02.495 --> 21:06.433
Happy New Year!

21:06.533 --> 21:07.900
Better?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.404
I think so. Try again.

21:11.504 --> 21:14.040
That's not what I want.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.278
Did you text your Mom
to come and pick us up?

21:19.379 --> 21:20.913
'Cause she's on her way
to the airport.

21:21.013 --> 21:24.116
-Oh!

21:24.216 --> 21:26.886
People and dogs
are kissing.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.555
You messed me up good, girl.

21:28.655 --> 21:32.725
