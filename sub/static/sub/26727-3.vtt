WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:08.008
I have to give you something, too.
A present.

00:08.925 --> 00:09.759
Yes!

00:10.343 --> 00:12.429
We didn't get to have hotpot.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.222
Let's do it.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.057
When?

00:16.933 --> 00:18.518
Anytime is fine.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.106
Anytime? What about work?

00:24.065 --> 00:27.485
I got suspended.
So, I'm jobless for two months.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.779
Was it because you hit my teacher?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.198
I'm so sorry!

00:32.365 --> 00:33.700
Why are you apologizing?

00:33.950 --> 00:35.368
But, it's my fault that...

00:36.494 --> 00:37.746
Stop talking.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.541
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.020
I wonder if he's already there.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.192
Tsukasa, over here!

02:33.153 --> 02:35.488
It's our first time to meet
since the start of winter break, right?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.407
You haven't been paying
any attention to me.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.409
Is it because you have a man now?

02:41.494 --> 02:42.328
Seriously?

02:42.579 --> 02:45.456
But, it's not like
we're actually going out.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.960
No, but as I see it,
it seems to be going pretty well!

02:49.210 --> 02:51.546
What happened to the Tsukasa I know?

02:51.796 --> 02:53.965
You're overreacting.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.927
Weren't you scared of men before?

02:58.845 --> 03:01.264
What's he like? Is he cool?
How did you meet?

03:01.431 --> 03:02.432
Well, let's see...

03:03.683 --> 03:07.520
He's a bit reserved,
and he gets mad at me often.

03:09.105 --> 03:13.192
But he's actually really kind and sincere
when he apologizes.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.112
Oh, he's also good at jumping.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.990
What do you mean? Does he do
track and field or something?

03:19.282 --> 03:21.868
Not really, but close enough.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.121
I see him on my way home every night.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.790
He's also been coming over after work.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.710
I would cook and we would eat together.

03:31.002 --> 03:34.088
What? He comes to your house
and you have dinner together?

03:34.589 --> 03:38.259
Is that okay? Is he a decent guy?
Can you trust him?

03:38.509 --> 03:40.720
Yes, I think I can trust him.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.350
Well, if you really think so.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.274
I'm so dirty.

03:53.691 --> 03:56.444
I keep hiding this ugly vampire inside me.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.198
Am I just pretending
to be on the side of justice?

04:02.784 --> 04:03.618
It's Yanagi.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.078
How are things going?

04:05.453 --> 04:07.205
Come see me after New Year's.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.332
It's almost time
for your physical examination.

04:09.540 --> 04:13.544
Also, it seems the owner of our usual bar
is throwing a party on New Year's Eve.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.256
I won't be going because of my family,

04:16.464 --> 04:18.174
but I heard there will be a lot
of single people.

04:18.549 --> 04:19.884
If you feel like going, you should go.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.137
I got carried away and bought a lot.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.308
I keep zoning out lately.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.228
Is it because I couldn't sleep last night?

04:32.939 --> 04:36.276
Hotpot with Mr. Anzai on New Year's Eve,

04:36.693 --> 04:38.861
just thinking about it makes me shy.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.909
-It hurts.
-I'm sorry! Are you okay?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.245
Yes, I'm okay.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.163
I'm really sorry!

04:51.624 --> 04:53.584
This person is...

04:53.918 --> 04:54.919
Here you go.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.463
Thank you very much.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.049
Goodbye, miss. I'm in a hurry!

05:01.676 --> 05:02.593
Do you know him?

05:04.220 --> 05:05.638
You startled me!

05:05.888 --> 05:08.808
-Oh, you already went to the supermarket?
-Yes.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.729
-Do you feel sick?
-What?

05:13.479 --> 05:14.897
No, not at all! Why?

05:15.273 --> 05:17.650
Well, your face looks unusual.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.652
It's not a cold, I'm fine.

05:19.902 --> 05:20.820
Really?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.071
Really.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.198
Hey, it's snowing.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.785
It would be nice if it piles up.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.413
It would be hard if it does.
Shoveling snow and all that.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.082
It's not that bad. Hey, I can hold that!

05:33.166 --> 05:34.292
I got it.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.005
Since this is Tokyo,
it won't pile up that much.

05:45.219 --> 05:50.558
A man involved in a restaurant stabbing
incident today is still on the loose.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.727
-The body...
-Are you from Hokkaido?

05:53.019 --> 05:55.813
Well, you could say so. The Obihiro area.

05:56.981 --> 05:57.899
That's nice.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.402
Then is it okay if you didn't come home
for New Year's?

06:01.486 --> 06:02.612
What about you?

06:02.945 --> 06:05.740
I don't really care. I don't go home.

06:07.116 --> 06:10.161
Did I ask something I shouldn't have?

06:10.286 --> 06:12.789
The victim's body was stabbed
in multiple areas with a knife.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.958
-A vampire probably did it.
-The direct cause of death was blood loss.

06:16.584 --> 06:19.003
To hide the fact that they drink blood,

06:19.212 --> 06:21.297
vampires tend to leave wounds
on the bodies.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.967
There's something off
about the guy who went missing.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.763
I see. I guess he's trying to run away.

06:29.263 --> 06:30.848
We're not really sure of anything.

06:31.641 --> 06:35.436
If the missing guy is really a vampire,
he may be around this area by now.

06:35.978 --> 06:39.816
All the way over here?
Isn't this far from the incident?

06:40.149 --> 06:43.236
Vampires have excellent physical
abilities. They can run very fast.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.072
Speaking of, do you know the guy earlier?

06:46.697 --> 06:47.615
He looked suspicious.

06:48.032 --> 06:51.452
I don't know him,
but he seemed like a good person.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.582
You are very careless!

06:56.916 --> 06:58.584
But he picked up the vegetables for me!

06:58.751 --> 07:00.837
Does picking up vegetables
make you a good person?

07:01.879 --> 07:04.632
But it's true that his face
looked vampire-like.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.759
Then isn't that even more dangerous?

07:07.093 --> 07:09.971
No. He had dark circles under his eyes.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.807
I wonder if that means
he hasn't drunk any blood.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.144
You understand very well.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.480
-But isn't he still a stranger?
-Yes.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.233
He's worried about me.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.949
This is bad. I...

07:34.495 --> 07:36.497
It will be extremely cold until dawn.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.250
Snow is predicted to fall in Tokyo.

07:39.333 --> 07:43.171
To those visiting shrines on New Year's,
please keep warm when you go outside.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.554
Dragging me out to work on New Year's Eve.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.974
We have to when the suspect is a vampire.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.727
Let's wait for the autopsy results
in the meantime.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.270
Hey! Are you guys detectives?

07:59.812 --> 08:02.815
A worker in my shop named Katagiri
is a vampire!

08:03.107 --> 08:06.444
He's the culprit. Hurry up and arrest him!

08:06.569 --> 08:08.654
You're the shop manager, Mr. Okino, right?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.073
We still don't know who the culprit is.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.118
Why? Wasn't the body drained of blood?

08:14.243 --> 08:16.579
It's obviously a vampire's fault!

08:16.662 --> 08:17.872
Calm down.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.081
Hey, you.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.585
Why is the smell of blood
coming from your body?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.379
Stop saying nonsense.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.590
What do you know?

08:27.798 --> 08:30.009
My sense of smell is a bit better than
that of humans.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.887
When a human smells of blood this much,

08:32.970 --> 08:35.056
it can only be from being soaked
in someone else's blood!

08:38.226 --> 08:39.977
Are you a vampire?

08:43.314 --> 08:45.566
Hello? What is it? I'm busy right now.

08:46.067 --> 08:49.320
-Sawazaki, are you looking for a vampire?
-What?

08:49.737 --> 08:51.656
It seems that the suspect
from the restaurant stabbing

08:52.365 --> 08:53.574
was falsely accused.

08:54.575 --> 08:55.618
He's innocent?

08:55.993 --> 08:57.245
The autopsy results can't be wrong.

08:57.828 --> 09:01.040
It was faked as a vampire's work
by causing massive blood loss.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.417
I still haven't confirmed
their identity yet,

09:03.918 --> 09:06.170
but a vampire fugitive may be nearby.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.631
Hey! Don't feed him!

09:09.215 --> 09:10.216
What's your name and age?

09:10.508 --> 09:11.384
Oryo...

09:11.634 --> 09:12.885
I mean your real name.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.013
Ryunosuke Katagiri, 36 years old.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.098
Did you hear that?

09:17.265 --> 09:18.182
It's definitely him.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.435
I'll send a car over. Where are you now?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.521
The dark circles under his eyes...

09:23.771 --> 09:25.565
Is your boyfriend a vampire?

09:26.315 --> 09:27.149
He's not my boyfriend!

09:27.233 --> 09:29.318
Then I got it wrong?
He's not your boyfriend?

09:29.443 --> 09:31.070
But you're together on New Year's Eve!

09:33.447 --> 09:34.824
I have something to ask you.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.785
If you were framed,
there's no need to run away.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.454
Why did you run all the way here?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.792
If you answer honestly,
I'll give you some hotpot.

09:46.794 --> 09:50.423
Vampires run faster than humans,
and they're even stronger.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.302
I've almost killed someone
in a simple fight as well.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.180
I've beaten a guy once and he bled a lot.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.349
Then an urge hit me.

10:01.434 --> 10:05.730
I lost my sense of reasoning,
and drank the blood of the guy I hated.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.569
That's when I decided
to never hurt a human again.

10:11.986 --> 10:15.323
If I felt like doing so,
I would get up and leave immediately.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.618
The girl who was killed
used to be a good kid.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.496
She was the only one in the shop
who treated me like I was human.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.668
I will never become a vampire.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.010
Thanks for the hotpot. It was delicious!

10:38.054 --> 10:40.806
That's his girlfriend? She's just a child.

10:41.223 --> 10:42.099
Let's go, Jill.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.560
My boobs are bigger than hers.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.687
Yuki!

10:46.979 --> 10:50.149
Come over next time! I'll be waiting!

10:51.651 --> 10:52.526
What was that about?

10:53.027 --> 10:54.820
Nothing. Let's go.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.281
What was she saying? As if I would go.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.409
That woman looked like a foreign actress.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.162
-What?
-I mean, she was gorgeous.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.665
Is she? She seems normal to me.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.545
Why are you crying?

11:11.754 --> 11:13.130
Sorry. It's nothing.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.466
Is it about what she said?

11:15.549 --> 11:18.803
That was just her talking nonsense!

11:18.886 --> 11:20.971
These stairs! You bought too much beer...

11:21.680 --> 11:23.224
I don't drink wine.

11:27.812 --> 11:28.729
It's all right.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.566
What in the world is it?

11:34.443 --> 11:35.361
I'm sorry.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.406
I feel so embarrassed with myself.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.991
What are you embarrassed about?

11:41.450 --> 11:45.955
She was so pretty. I thought she was nice
and things like that.

11:46.580 --> 11:50.167
Also, I don't even know your first name.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.508
What? What is this?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.886
This is like the dreams I've had
several times before.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.514
I'm really embarrassing.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.684
This thing only happens in my dreams,

12:07.143 --> 12:10.563
I'm totally incompatible with Mr. Anzai.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.401
Hey!

12:17.570 --> 12:19.321
Mr. Anzai.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.784
Her face is redder than before.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.786
Hey, can you walk?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.747
I should be the one embarrassed.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.749
I knew her face looked different,

12:31.250 --> 12:32.793
but I didn't mind it
until she got this sick.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.297
This is the illumination
at Sapporo's Odori Park.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.341
-Hokkaido...
-There are already many people here

12:39.675 --> 12:41.677
-I want to go there someday.
-waiting for the countdown.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.387
It's really cold.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.557
Do you want to go?

12:53.522 --> 12:56.317
-Let's go out.
-Yes.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.114
What am I doing?
If I don't get a sedative fast, I'll...

13:05.534 --> 13:07.995
The countdown will begin soon!

13:08.204 --> 13:12.208
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

13:12.541 --> 13:15.628
-What was I saying? "Go out"?
-Six, five, four...

13:16.504 --> 13:20.090
She's a human. I'm a vampire.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.801
Another one?

13:23.886 --> 13:27.056
Shot in the head with a 7.62mm bullet,
an instant death.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.807
This is the fifth one.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.101
Jill, take a look.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.561
I already did!

13:37.691 --> 13:40.152
Could the fact that you didn't change
after seeing his blood

13:40.236 --> 13:42.404
mean that he isn't a human?

13:42.655 --> 13:46.784
-Can't you at least ask if I'm okay?
-Fine.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.410
There, there.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.794
The number of serial shooting victims
is now five.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.588
They were all shot in the head once.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.051
And, the victims were all vampires.

14:04.843 --> 14:05.678
Vampires?

14:05.886 --> 14:09.223
But they didn't change
at the time they were murdered.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.724
They all looked like humans.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.686
So, the culprit knew they were vampires
and killed them?

14:14.019 --> 14:15.145
Based on that hypothesis,

14:15.521 --> 14:18.065
how did the culprit know
that the victims were vampires?

14:19.024 --> 14:20.276
The only ones with this information

14:20.359 --> 14:23.612
are the ward offices, insurance companies,
hospitals, and the police.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.073
It could also be dating websites
for vampires, but...

14:27.491 --> 14:30.327
What's up? Did you promise
to meet with someone, Yuki?

14:30.703 --> 14:33.455
Anyway, how far have you gone?
Did you touch her boobs at least?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.207
What are you loudly talking about?

14:36.083 --> 14:37.960
But I'm really interested.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.796
How are you going out with a human girl?

14:41.547 --> 14:43.299
You get excited when you see blood.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.885
When you get excited,
you want to drink blood.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.846
If you're unlucky,
you can't even make out, can you?

14:49.054 --> 14:51.056
Enough with this nonsense
and stop with the hands.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.392
Actually, you're very restrained.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.978
Shall I handle it?

14:56.937 --> 14:57.897
Hey, you guys!

14:58.397 --> 15:01.066
Why do you think I called Anzai
even if he's suspended?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.485
If a list of vampires' names was leaked,

15:03.944 --> 15:06.530
even the both of you can become targets.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.825
What? Are you worried about us?

15:10.451 --> 15:11.827
It means that I have no time to care.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.954
So, you need to take care of yourselves.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.664
You're so cold!

15:17.750 --> 15:19.543
They're like children, aren't they?

15:21.253 --> 15:22.212
Hey!

15:22.546 --> 15:23.380
Yanagi.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.342
I thought my patient might have come here.

15:26.675 --> 15:30.262
I'll do the physical exam next time.
It doesn't mean I've forgotten.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.473
Didn't I tell you to come over
at the start of the year?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.975
I bet you're nearly
out of sedatives by now.

15:35.559 --> 15:36.852
I still have one left.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.896
Just one?
Aren't you using them way too fast?

15:39.271 --> 15:42.191
Hey, Anzai, decide when you're coming now!
Will it be today?

15:42.566 --> 15:44.568
Today's no good. Tomorrow.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.946
Tomorrow then!
Make it 10:00 a.m. tomorrow!

15:47.029 --> 15:48.197
His delinquent past is showing.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.949
Speaking of a list of vampire names,

15:50.282 --> 15:53.035
what's the vampire population anyway?

15:53.243 --> 15:57.331
Was it 0.01 percent, Sawazaki?

15:58.082 --> 16:00.376
In the country,
it's around that percentage.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.461
Tokyo has about 1000.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.297
They're an endangered species.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.342
Since sex between humans
and vampires has been legalized,

16:08.550 --> 16:11.261
I wonder if the number of pure-blooded
vampires will slowly decrease.

16:12.262 --> 16:15.265
What if you and your girlfriend
do it with Yanagi around?

16:15.349 --> 16:16.767
Stop the dirty jokes!

16:17.267 --> 16:18.727
Stop fighting!

16:24.942 --> 16:28.112
I still haven't prepared anything
for Christmas.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.571
I forgot to say something.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.782
You're free to meet the girl,

16:31.865 --> 16:34.576
but don't leap off the telephone poles
for now and draw too much attention.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.663
I get it. I'm walking normally
on the ground.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.456
I bet you're going to leap off instantly.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.041
I'm hanging up.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.216
Cheese-stuffed cabbage rolls.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.844
I think it's a really good idea.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.053
It looks delicious.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.723
He should be home soon.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.559
What am I saying? I've accidentally
said something weird!

16:59.226 --> 17:01.103
It's really okay to trust him, right?

17:01.562 --> 17:03.105
Haven't I been saying that?

17:03.355 --> 17:04.857
But I'm worried!

17:04.940 --> 17:07.568
You've never been interested
in love before!

17:08.027 --> 17:11.822
-You haven't been dating for long, right?
-Well, yes.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.033
You have to be careful.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.577
If there's anything you need,
call me, okay?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.203
She's like my mother.

17:19.121 --> 17:22.499
But, it's true that we haven't been
going out for long.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.752
It's only been about two months
since we met.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.796
I'm not even his girlfriend.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.759
I still feel like I don't know anything
about Mr. Anzai.

17:32.926 --> 17:36.597
Why does Mr. Anzai keep coming over?

17:38.515 --> 17:40.225
What is it? Is it a package?

17:40.851 --> 17:43.145
Mr. Anzai always comes in
through the veranda...

17:45.522 --> 17:47.066
What is wrong with you?

17:47.232 --> 17:49.735
But what are you doing
at the front door today?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.570
Times like this can happen, too, you know.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.322
The rice is done.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.700
I made cabbage rolls today.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.036
I've been working on it,
so I think it'll be good.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.083
How's your health?

18:04.708 --> 18:06.001
My health?

18:06.293 --> 18:07.586
Good! I'm totally all right now!

18:07.920 --> 18:10.297
Are you still feeling sick?
Your hands still feel hot.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.508
Your hands are just cold.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.468
Your usual temperature
is 27 degrees Celsius, right?

18:14.635 --> 18:17.054
Are all vampires the same?

18:17.137 --> 18:19.014
Did you go out today?

18:19.389 --> 18:21.433
Not really, I just went
to the supermarket.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.728
Something feels a little different.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.232
Oh, I put some makeup on.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.138
I like you...

19:00.764 --> 19:01.723
What?

19:09.356 --> 19:10.357
Did I miss?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.110
Next time, it will be your head.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.903
Die, monster.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.573
Mr. Anzai!

19:19.867 --> 19:21.660
-Are you hurt?
-No.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.328
More importantly, you're...

19:23.787 --> 19:24.913
Don't cry.

19:25.831 --> 19:26.915
I'm fine.

19:27.624 --> 19:28.709
Lower your head.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.796
Where did it come from?
Since when were they aiming for me?

19:33.297 --> 19:35.424
No, why me?

19:36.091 --> 19:37.092
Is it because I'm a vampire?

19:51.064 --> 19:53.483
Kill...

19:54.109 --> 19:55.903
-Are you okay?
-I'll kill you!

20:18.383 --> 20:19.635
I like you.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.097
There!

20:30.646 --> 20:32.940
Wait, Mr. Anzai!

20:41.698 --> 20:44.284
IT'S LATE, BUT MERRY CHRISTMAS

20:47.996 --> 20:48.830
Is he here?

20:52.334 --> 20:53.835
Don't touch me, monster!

21:01.343 --> 21:03.387
What's your motive, murderer?

21:03.553 --> 21:05.305
Your kind are the murderers!

21:07.015 --> 21:09.685
You act nice until you get
the chance to drink blood!

21:12.312 --> 21:14.731
My mother died because of you!

21:15.315 --> 21:17.693
If vampires didn't exist,
she would still be alive!

21:17.985 --> 21:19.278
That's why I will kill you.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.947
So no one will be killed again!

21:23.615 --> 21:24.449
Shit!

21:29.329 --> 21:33.542
I hate all of you.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.018
You're unexpectedly weak.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.312
Are you an ordinary human?

23:27.948 --> 23:28.824
Devil's Line.

23:29.658 --> 23:30.575
Line 4.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.202
Monster.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.038
