00:08.050 --> 00:10.320
- Congratulations.\N- Thank you.

00:10.389 --> 00:12.389
Go on inside.

00:12.650 --> 00:14.520
Gosh, you're here.

00:14.520 --> 00:15.818
- Congratulations.\N- Of course.

00:15.818 --> 00:17.329
- Hello.\N- Thank you.

00:17.329 --> 00:19.629
- Thank you.\N- Welcome.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.530
Let me check on the bride.

00:23.530 --> 00:24.530
Sure.

00:38.109 --> 00:40.249
My goodness.

00:46.219 --> 00:48.590
You look so beautiful.

00:52.660 --> 00:54.730
Mother, where is he?

00:55.560 --> 00:57.429
I thought he was with you.

00:57.429 --> 00:58.600
He's not.

01:00.340 --> 01:02.300
Then where is he?

01:10.350 --> 01:12.449
I can't believe this is\Nhappening today.

01:13.119 --> 01:15.419
Why won't she pick up?

01:16.720 --> 01:17.720
What time is it?

01:19.319 --> 01:21.690
I can't believe\NI'm late to the wedding.

01:22.490 --> 01:26.559
(Your way to the banquet)

01:26.559 --> 01:28.600
I asked him many times\Nto get here on time.

01:28.860 --> 01:31.100
How can he be late\Nto his own wedding?

01:35.970 --> 01:37.039
There he is.

01:38.169 --> 01:40.009
Why are you so late?

01:40.979 --> 01:45.050
It's now time to\Nexchange rings,

01:45.050 --> 01:47.580
a token of their love.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.220
To do that,

01:49.220 --> 01:52.020
will the bride and\Nthe groom face each other?

01:55.589 --> 01:59.089
You can tell how much\Nthey love each other.

01:59.089 --> 02:01.000
When the groom puts on\Nthe ring on her,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.500
and when the bride puts on\Nthe ring on him,

02:03.500 --> 02:05.970
give them a big hand.

02:06.339 --> 02:09.770
First, the groom will put\Nthe ring on the bride.

02:10.110 --> 02:11.410
What about\Nthe wedding car?

02:11.539 --> 02:13.809
It's all ready.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.649
The bride seems\Nvery nervous today.

02:26.089 --> 02:27.689
I object to this marriage!

02:33.599 --> 02:34.659
This can't happen.

02:35.059 --> 02:36.129
Detective Ha?

02:36.129 --> 02:37.969
How can you do this to me?

02:39.399 --> 02:41.570
What about me?

02:43.540 --> 02:44.670
This can't be!

02:45.070 --> 02:46.210
No way!

02:46.480 --> 02:48.010
This wedding is annulled!

02:52.480 --> 02:53.550
Who are you...

02:53.779 --> 02:55.879
to make a scene\Nat their wedding?

02:57.920 --> 02:58.920
Me?

03:01.159 --> 03:02.420
Who am I?

03:03.059 --> 03:04.290
Oh, I came in a hurry.

03:04.490 --> 03:05.629
Here it is.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.730
Me?

03:10.129 --> 03:11.570
I'm Seodong's Sniffer.

03:16.309 --> 03:19.640
(Queen of Mystery 2)

03:19.809 --> 03:23.279
(5 weeks ago)

03:26.249 --> 03:27.649
I think it's time.

03:28.020 --> 03:29.050
Really?

03:29.050 --> 03:31.119
I had no idea.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.760
- Hello.\N- You're here.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.860
- I'm here.\N- Hello.

03:38.929 --> 03:41.629
Ms. Kim,\Nit's been forever.

03:42.599 --> 03:44.730
- How's business?\N- You're here, Ms. Park.

03:44.730 --> 03:47.339
Of course, my daughter is\Ngoing to be on TV.

03:47.339 --> 03:49.570
It's been forever\Nsince they got divorced.

03:49.570 --> 03:51.439
She isn't your\Ndaughter-in-law anymore.

03:52.839 --> 03:54.610
She's like one of my own.

03:54.879 --> 03:56.679
What are you doing?\NIt's about to begin.

03:56.679 --> 03:57.809
Let's go in.

04:02.219 --> 04:04.349
Welcome to\N"Fresh Morning Live".

04:04.349 --> 04:05.550
Hello, I am Lee Ji Hye.

04:05.550 --> 04:06.760
I'm Hwang Yun Seong.

04:09.260 --> 04:11.230
On today's episode of\N"Fresh Morning Live",

04:11.230 --> 04:13.360
we have a man who says,\N"You're under arrest."

04:13.360 --> 04:16.099
He's a profiler who has\Narrested many criminals.

04:16.099 --> 04:17.829
Inspector Woo Sung Ha\Nis here with us.

04:17.829 --> 04:18.928
- Welcome.\N- Welcome.

04:18.928 --> 04:20.570
Hello, I'm Woo Sung Ha.

04:21.439 --> 04:23.469
By the way,\NI heard you took the exam.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.440
Are you a cop now?

04:25.440 --> 04:27.109
Taking the exam\Ndoesn't mean you're a cop.

04:27.109 --> 04:29.380
Don't you know\Nhow difficult the exam is?

04:29.909 --> 04:31.849
It doesn't seem like\Nit's that hard.

04:35.450 --> 04:37.349
She'll pass this time\Nfor sure.

04:38.849 --> 04:40.859
Kyung Mi said\Nshe'd help me.

04:42.060 --> 04:44.630
Being a cop is\Nso dangerous though.

04:44.859 --> 04:46.500
He is famous\Nfor arresting...

04:46.500 --> 04:48.659
Park Yong Soo,\Nthe duct tape murderer.

04:48.659 --> 04:50.469
I heard a civilian\Ncontributed a lot...

04:50.469 --> 04:52.299
to solve this case.

04:52.599 --> 04:53.870
Yes, that's right.

04:53.870 --> 04:56.370
She was a house wife\Nliving in Baebang-dong.

04:58.839 --> 05:00.710
A drug deal at a market?

05:00.710 --> 05:02.310
This is\Na delivery accident.

05:02.539 --> 05:04.779
It has to do with\Ntransporting drugs.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.320
What?

05:14.289 --> 05:15.320
A murder?

05:15.320 --> 05:17.690
The criminal is\Nfamiliar with this house.

05:18.159 --> 05:19.599
Someone died here.

05:19.599 --> 05:20.760
Lady!

05:20.760 --> 05:22.560
If I see you\Nat a crime scene again...

05:23.630 --> 05:25.930
I think I know\Nmore than you do.

05:25.930 --> 05:27.669
How can you say\Nthis is a theft scene?

05:27.669 --> 05:29.270
It's obviously\Na scene of a murder.

05:29.270 --> 05:30.339
Lady!

05:30.339 --> 05:33.109
You just terrorized\Nthe police's authority.

05:33.979 --> 05:36.479
Don't come crying\Nback to me.

05:37.649 --> 05:39.649
He moved the body,\Ndidn't he?

05:39.649 --> 05:40.820
The criminal is...

05:41.649 --> 05:42.750
The criminal is?

05:42.750 --> 05:45.250
That means he taped her\Nwhile she was alive.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.859
It must've taken a long\Ntime for her to die.

05:47.859 --> 05:49.989
He enjoys\Nthe act of murder.

05:49.989 --> 05:51.060
He is...

05:51.089 --> 05:52.659
- moving by car.\N- He's moving by car.

05:53.430 --> 05:54.500
A mannequin.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.169
I think so.

05:57.169 --> 05:58.700
I respect you,\NDetective Ha.

06:00.469 --> 06:02.839
We'll put her live on TV.

06:05.039 --> 06:06.140
It's plastic twine.

06:06.140 --> 06:08.580
But there is\Nno trace of use.

06:08.580 --> 06:11.649
He isn't the one\Nwho killed Joo Yeon.

06:15.219 --> 06:18.049
- What?\N- I didn't see Seol Ok.

06:18.049 --> 06:19.250
That was unbelievable.

06:19.250 --> 06:22.760
I agree. She was amazing\Nat reasoning.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.630
I hope you understand...

06:24.630 --> 06:26.260
that I can't reveal\Nher identity...

06:26.260 --> 06:28.659
in order to protect\Nher privacy.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.630
He didn't have to\Nprotect me that much.

06:32.469 --> 06:34.500
The viewers have\Nthe right to know too.

06:35.599 --> 06:37.010
It's that detective again.

06:37.570 --> 06:39.609
Why are they\Nalways together?

06:41.210 --> 06:43.810
You know the answer,\Ndon't you?

06:44.149 --> 06:45.710
After abducting\Nthe victim,

06:45.710 --> 06:47.250
he cleaned the body\Nwith alcohol...

06:54.460 --> 06:56.460
Are you sure this is the\Nright department store?

06:56.690 --> 06:58.659
Yes. I'm sure.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.399
I can smell it.\NI have a feeling.

07:01.399 --> 07:04.700
Two men shopping together.\NWe stand out too much.

07:05.430 --> 07:06.969
I don't know\Nwhat you're saying.

07:12.570 --> 07:15.479
Gosh, they shouldn't\Nswipe cards too much.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.409
How can we catch\Na card scammer...

07:18.409 --> 07:19.409
if they swipe it so much?

07:20.120 --> 07:22.779
She looks kind of fat\Nbecause she's pixelated.

07:24.589 --> 07:25.890
I can see her\Nif I squint my eyes.

07:31.729 --> 07:34.500
They kept buying\N1 plus 1 items.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.339
I saw them often\Nwhen I was patrolling.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.450
- Touch my forehead.\N- Let's see.

07:57.589 --> 07:58.820
You're hot.

07:58.989 --> 08:00.789
Give me your hand.

08:05.589 --> 08:07.859
Seol Ok. You aren't\Ntogether, are you?

08:07.859 --> 08:09.770
We were having\Na case meeting.

08:09.770 --> 08:11.399
It's okay.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.570
What's wrong with dating?

08:13.570 --> 08:15.969
That's right.\NShe's divorced now.

08:17.870 --> 08:20.810
Detective Ha\Nmoved next door.

08:21.339 --> 08:23.149
Why don't they\Njust live together?

08:24.349 --> 08:26.180
- Should it go up there?\N- Okay.

08:26.180 --> 08:27.180
I'm here.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.549
- What are you doing?\N- I'll help.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.190
It's okay.\NYou don't have to.

08:31.190 --> 08:33.289
- No, I'll help.\N- It's okay.

08:34.359 --> 08:35.460
Hold this then.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.330
Are you kidding me?

08:40.330 --> 08:41.999
They whisper\Nto each other,

08:41.999 --> 08:44.369
text and call each other\Nall the time.

08:52.210 --> 08:54.680
They come here at night\Nand eat ramyeon.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.839
Ramyeon?

08:56.479 --> 08:58.080
That means\Nthey went all the way.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.550
No!

09:02.580 --> 09:03.989
We aren't dating.

09:05.650 --> 09:06.889
They aren't dating.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.060
She says they aren't!

09:15.359 --> 09:16.400
Detective Ha?

09:21.900 --> 09:23.810
There's a case.\NI have to go.

09:23.810 --> 09:25.469
Put on some makeup.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.979
I'm going there\Nto catch a criminal.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.810
What you just said\Nis stupid.

09:34.519 --> 09:36.249
Your boyfriend will\Nlike this.

09:36.249 --> 09:37.920
He's not my boyfriend.

09:38.389 --> 09:41.190
I see. Please wait here.

09:43.389 --> 09:44.930
How long will this take?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.359
I was here all morning\Nlike you told me to.

09:47.359 --> 09:48.999
But I didn't get anything\Nout of it.

09:49.629 --> 09:51.469
This is the place.

09:52.229 --> 09:54.570
Do you see Jhanel shop\Nover there?

09:54.999 --> 09:57.009
Have you heard\Nof Jha-tech?

09:57.710 --> 09:59.139
If he has\Na duplicate card,

09:59.139 --> 10:00.780
he'd buy that first.

10:01.009 --> 10:03.080
If he comes to this\Ndepartment store often,

10:03.080 --> 10:05.379
he wouldn't pass\Nthat shop by.

10:06.379 --> 10:08.180
Your husband\Nmust like this.

10:08.180 --> 10:09.379
I'm single.

10:13.889 --> 10:15.089
He looks suspicious.

10:15.290 --> 10:18.129
He acts like\Na credit card scammer.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.560
He looks very normal.

10:26.469 --> 10:28.940
Ordinary men aren't\Npassionate...

10:29.300 --> 10:30.839
about shopping like him.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.469
You said we should\Nget rid of out prejudice.

10:32.469 --> 10:34.210
It's not just women\Nthat shop.

10:34.780 --> 10:36.249
He looks\Nat the price first.

10:36.249 --> 10:37.710
He isn't interested\Nin the design.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.219
That's what men do when\Nthey buy women's clothes.

10:40.219 --> 10:42.379
They look at the design\Nwhen they buy a car.

10:43.450 --> 10:45.820
Hey. This would look\Ngood on you.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.690
He's buying\Nonly the black labels.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.229
He's buying only\Nthe expensive ones.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.430
He's planning on\Nreselling it.

11:03.369 --> 11:04.910
Why are you throwing it?

11:04.910 --> 11:06.280
I wanted to see\Nif you could catch it.

11:06.410 --> 11:07.609
Go and pay for it.

11:08.940 --> 11:10.780
Are they married\Nor just lovers?

11:10.979 --> 11:12.310
In both cases,

11:12.310 --> 11:14.879
they wouldn't play with\Nluxury bags like that.

11:14.979 --> 11:17.349
They're professionals\Nand organized.

11:17.550 --> 11:19.389
That looks good.

11:20.259 --> 11:21.619
How about that one?

11:22.489 --> 11:23.989
- It's pretty.\N- Right?

11:24.229 --> 11:25.830
Excuse me.\NGive me that one.

11:28.359 --> 11:30.269
Jewelry is the best item\Nto resell.

11:36.099 --> 11:37.369
That's pretty.

11:38.540 --> 11:39.639
Wake up.

11:40.109 --> 11:41.710
You just got divorced.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.310
I'm trying to\Nlook natural.

11:43.910 --> 11:45.109
You're making it...

11:45.109 --> 11:47.180
too obvious\Nthat you're a detective.

11:48.820 --> 11:49.920
Would you like to see it?

11:49.920 --> 11:52.050
Yes. Can I try it on?

11:52.050 --> 11:53.460
Yes, you can.

11:55.660 --> 11:57.460
This is so pretty.

12:01.099 --> 12:02.259
Detective...

12:03.430 --> 12:04.430
Excuse me.

12:04.999 --> 12:06.499
May I see\Nyour credit card?

12:35.099 --> 12:36.430
Gosh.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.930
- That hurts.\N- It hurts.

12:39.129 --> 12:40.570
Don't touch me.

12:40.570 --> 12:43.769
Is that card\Nreally a duplicate?

12:43.769 --> 12:44.769
Why do you ask?

12:45.839 --> 12:48.440
Because it's not\Na magnetic card,

12:48.710 --> 12:50.109
but it has\Nan IC chip instead.

12:50.109 --> 12:51.810
It's not a duplicate.

12:51.810 --> 12:53.619
Then why did you run away?

12:53.619 --> 12:55.080
Get in.

12:55.420 --> 12:56.849
Hey, get going.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.690
Have you eaten yet?

13:04.729 --> 13:05.889
I don't remember.

13:05.889 --> 13:07.300
Have we eaten yet?

13:07.300 --> 13:08.859
We haven't eaten yet.

13:09.430 --> 13:10.869
Don't skip meals.

13:10.869 --> 13:13.099
Most detectives\Ncan't help it.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.239
Share this with Mr. Bae.

13:16.540 --> 13:18.410
I made some gimbap.

13:19.469 --> 13:20.639
Did you really make it?

13:27.450 --> 13:29.790
Gosh. This looks\Nreally delicious.

13:38.089 --> 13:41.400
Hey, why does it only have\Npickled radish?

13:42.759 --> 13:44.430
Mine only has spinach.

13:46.269 --> 13:49.469
Gosh, if you can eat that,\Nthen that's love.

13:52.369 --> 13:54.009
It's not like that.

13:54.139 --> 13:55.210
Yes, it is.

13:55.739 --> 13:57.410
Stop flirting already...

13:57.410 --> 13:58.479
or you're going to\Nlose her.

13:58.479 --> 14:00.680
She's only interested in\Ncatching criminals.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.519
Look at me.\NI have nothing.

14:03.849 --> 14:06.119
I have no money.\NMy family has no money.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.160
But I'm in a relationship\Nwith a beautiful...

14:08.160 --> 14:09.389
businesswoman\Nwith a college degree...

14:09.389 --> 14:11.259
who is 18 years\Nyounger than me.

14:13.460 --> 14:14.999
I'm better at...

14:15.499 --> 14:17.900
capturing girls' hearts\Nthan the culprit.

14:19.670 --> 14:20.670
Well...

14:22.269 --> 14:23.339
Do you have any know-how?

14:23.339 --> 14:24.410
There's no such thing.

14:24.410 --> 14:25.810
"I like you. I love you."

14:25.810 --> 14:28.139
You just need\Nto express your feelings.

14:29.379 --> 14:30.509
I can't do that.

14:30.509 --> 14:31.550
I can't.

14:31.710 --> 14:33.849
Then put handcuffs on her\Nwithout saying anything.

14:33.849 --> 14:34.950
With what charge?

14:37.420 --> 14:39.589
I meant here.

14:39.889 --> 14:41.690
I meant you should\Narrest her heart.

14:41.690 --> 14:42.790
Her heart.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.190
A ring?

14:58.440 --> 15:00.139
Gosh, the ring.

15:05.910 --> 15:08.019
We kept on\Nlooking at rings.

15:08.420 --> 15:10.019
Does that mean he'll know?

15:10.089 --> 15:12.119
I'm sure he'll go\Nbuy a ring soon.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.759
I don't think so.

15:14.519 --> 15:15.889
I got sworn at...

15:16.060 --> 15:17.690
because I wasn't focusing.

15:19.359 --> 15:20.560
Gosh, it's tiring.

15:21.729 --> 15:24.030
Now, put your legs above\Nthe ground this time.

15:37.310 --> 15:40.619
I've never\Nstopped dating men.

15:40.749 --> 15:41.879
I'm sure about it.

15:41.879 --> 15:43.749
He'll take it once\Nyou give him a chance.

15:43.950 --> 15:45.619
I know you're\Nalways popular,

15:45.950 --> 15:48.160
- but for me...\N- You're attractive too.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.519
Be confident.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.460
Men don't come near you...

15:51.460 --> 15:53.099
because you never\Ngive them a chance.

15:53.830 --> 15:55.359
Men aren't...

15:55.359 --> 15:57.999
as strong as you think.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.099
They express their\Nfeelings only when...

16:00.099 --> 16:01.170
they're sure\Nshe'll accept it.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.910
Do I give...

16:04.369 --> 16:05.639
no break?

16:09.139 --> 16:12.650
Don't open your eyes wide\Nwhen you talk with men.

16:15.479 --> 16:16.619
Like this.

16:18.849 --> 16:20.859
That's right.

16:20.859 --> 16:22.560
There you go.

16:22.790 --> 16:25.229
I'm sleepy now that\NI open my eyes like this.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.430
- Hey.\N- What?

16:32.430 --> 16:33.670
Goodness, those punks.

16:37.109 --> 16:38.639
Stop catching culprits.

16:38.639 --> 16:40.639
Think only about\Npassing the exam.

16:40.639 --> 16:41.879
You need to be\Na policewoman.

16:41.879 --> 16:43.879
I want to be a policewoman\Nto catch culprits.

16:43.879 --> 16:46.210
You have to become one\Nto catch culprits.

16:46.420 --> 16:48.680
I need to be a policewoman\Nto catch culprits,

16:48.979 --> 16:50.589
but in order to\Nbe a policewoman,

16:50.619 --> 16:52.119
I shouldn't\Ncatch any culprit.

16:52.119 --> 16:54.290
- Go!\N- I don't know. Whatever.

17:20.450 --> 17:22.319
I need to catch\Nculprits anyway.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.489
That way, we won't\Nhave another victim.

17:24.549 --> 17:27.460
I think you've just\Nmade a new police record.

17:27.460 --> 17:28.559
Really?

17:28.920 --> 17:31.329
Do they have a special\Nhire for talented runners?

17:31.329 --> 17:32.390
No.

17:44.710 --> 17:45.710
Don't move.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.210
I'll arrest you.

17:55.650 --> 17:57.549
There's no way she\Nwon't accept this.

17:57.719 --> 17:59.120
I would\Nif I were a woman too.

17:59.219 --> 18:00.489
This ring is\Nexpensive too.

18:02.590 --> 18:05.329
Seol Ok, show yourself up\Nand I'll...

18:05.329 --> 18:06.430
If I do,

18:06.430 --> 18:07.600
what will you do?

18:08.630 --> 18:10.269
Why are you so surprised?

18:11.069 --> 18:12.700
You were waiting for me\Nto show up.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.469
Did you find anything\Nfrom the card culprit?

18:17.969 --> 18:19.809
Nothing special yet.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.009
You shouldn't be hanging\Naround like this then.

18:22.509 --> 18:24.450
Mr. Bae is interrogating\Nhim today.

18:24.450 --> 18:26.110
Mr. Bae isn't\Nyour subordinate.

18:26.249 --> 18:28.279
You always make your\Nsuperior do all the work.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.850
How decent\Nyour work life is.

18:31.019 --> 18:32.450
I don't make him\Ndo all the work.

18:32.650 --> 18:34.960
I came out to\Nbuy something.

18:35.090 --> 18:36.190
What are you going to buy?

18:39.130 --> 18:40.200
It's none of\Nyour business.

19:08.090 --> 19:09.219
Are you okay?

19:10.759 --> 19:11.989
It's hot in here.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.660
It's cold for me.

19:15.299 --> 19:16.370
You're having\Niced coffee, right?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.479
What was he touching\Nin his pocket?

19:36.450 --> 19:37.719
It's that ring.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.090
Forget the coffee.

19:45.130 --> 19:46.259
Let's go out for some air.

20:15.860 --> 20:16.960
Hold his hand.

20:17.759 --> 20:18.860
Hold it.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.499
Hold it, you fool.

20:21.559 --> 20:22.630
Do it!

20:23.130 --> 20:25.130
This is the time. Do it.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.969
Gosh, it's freezing\Nall of a sudden.

20:30.539 --> 20:31.539
I was sweating\Na while ago.

20:37.950 --> 20:39.049
Give her the ring.

20:39.249 --> 20:40.450
The ring!

20:41.450 --> 20:42.620
Do it already.

20:42.620 --> 20:44.019
The ring?

20:44.019 --> 20:46.049
Yes, the ring. You fool.

20:51.229 --> 20:53.160
Look, it's a snowman.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.059
You're right.\NWhy is it here?

21:10.809 --> 21:12.920
Hold his hand right now!

21:13.019 --> 21:14.350
Hold her hand already!

21:26.059 --> 21:27.460
Your hand is cold.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.999
It's cold. You want to\Nhave a drink?

21:31.130 --> 21:34.200
Well, if that's\Nwhat you want.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.549
What do you do for living?

21:53.059 --> 21:54.190
What are you waiting for?

21:54.190 --> 21:55.390
Your drink is ready.

21:57.489 --> 21:59.130
Forget it.\NIts color is weird.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.059
I won't get fooled twice.

22:01.059 --> 22:02.799
You'll know it's different\Nonce you drink it.

22:06.299 --> 22:07.940
I'm pretty good\Nat making soju bombs.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.029
Here's your egg.

22:44.469 --> 22:45.469
Cheers.

22:52.380 --> 22:53.380
You want one more?

22:53.579 --> 22:55.279
How did you hold this...

22:55.680 --> 22:56.690
throughout\Nyour marriage life?

22:56.690 --> 22:58.450
I didn't hold it.

22:58.549 --> 23:00.989
I had drinks with Kyung Mi\Nat daytime every day.

23:01.219 --> 23:02.219
I thought so.

23:03.890 --> 23:05.630
Otherwise, you wouldn't be\Nthis good at drinking.

23:17.269 --> 23:18.370
You fool.

23:19.140 --> 23:20.680
You aren't sane\Nfor certain.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.079
You must be stupid...

23:23.509 --> 23:24.610
or crazy.

23:24.710 --> 23:25.809
Hey, lady.

23:26.420 --> 23:27.519
Are you drunk?

23:28.479 --> 23:29.749
Seo Hyun Soo.

23:32.519 --> 23:34.090
That's the name...

23:34.890 --> 23:35.960
of your first love, right?

23:38.430 --> 23:41.759
How could you wait for\None woman for 17 years?

23:43.700 --> 23:44.900
That's a lie, right?

23:45.469 --> 23:46.799
You had a lot\Nof women, right?

23:47.900 --> 23:49.809
There's no way you didn't.

23:49.910 --> 23:51.269
Some people\Nhave an affair...

23:51.269 --> 23:52.809
even when they're married.

23:53.779 --> 23:55.110
Was he bad to you?

23:59.210 --> 24:00.549
Did you struggle a lot?

24:03.789 --> 24:05.450
Why are you changing\Nthe subject?

24:07.090 --> 24:08.190
I asked you...

24:09.019 --> 24:11.329
if you had never liked\Nanother woman.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.200
What?

24:24.410 --> 24:25.969
What is it?

24:32.880 --> 24:34.479
I have to go\Nto the bathroom.

24:51.430 --> 24:54.069
Lady, wait for me.

24:55.900 --> 24:57.969
You're under arrest.

25:24.229 --> 25:25.569
Have some honey tea.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.069
What's going on?

25:30.069 --> 25:31.269
What do you mean?

25:32.440 --> 25:33.739
What happened?

25:34.809 --> 25:35.809
What?

25:35.809 --> 25:37.610
Why did you and\NDetective Ha fight...

25:37.610 --> 25:39.380
- in front of the house?\N- I did?

25:39.380 --> 25:42.579
You were talking about\Na ring or something.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.850
A ring?

25:45.819 --> 25:47.190
Right, the ring.

25:52.059 --> 25:53.229
The ring.

26:01.069 --> 26:02.239
That player.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.509
That player?

26:04.069 --> 26:06.309
Who? Detective Ha?

26:06.309 --> 26:07.940
Don't say his name\Nin front of me.

26:07.940 --> 26:10.279
No Ha Wan Seung,\NLieutenant Ha,

26:10.279 --> 26:11.579
or Detective Ha.

26:18.090 --> 26:19.150
What's with her?

26:35.569 --> 26:36.710
That gold-digger.

26:37.210 --> 26:39.410
How can she take the ring\Nand ignore me like this?

26:39.410 --> 26:40.610
That cost me a fortune.

26:42.809 --> 26:45.309
Of course.\NYou feel bad about that.

26:45.309 --> 26:46.479
What are you doing\Nover there?

26:46.479 --> 26:47.779
Why aren't you\Npicking up your phone?

26:47.850 --> 26:50.719
Why did you call?\NWhat's your excuse?

26:50.719 --> 26:52.850
I guess\Nmy battery is dead.

26:53.090 --> 26:54.989
What kind of\Nan excuse is that?

27:01.930 --> 27:03.430
You have to recycle.

27:04.400 --> 27:05.969
Hop in.\NWe have to go somewhere.

27:05.969 --> 27:07.400
Forget it.

27:07.469 --> 27:09.710
I'm busy preparing\Nfor my fitness test.

27:12.370 --> 27:13.509
Yes?

27:13.509 --> 27:16.110
Does he not remember or\Nis he pretending not to?

27:18.910 --> 27:19.920
Really?

27:20.650 --> 27:21.719
Is that so?

27:22.680 --> 27:23.690
Okay.

27:27.319 --> 27:28.360
Why?

27:29.019 --> 27:30.289
They found\Nthe credit card owner.

27:39.229 --> 27:40.840
- Detective Lee.\N- Hey.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.370
Hello.

27:43.069 --> 27:44.569
It took a little longer...

27:44.569 --> 27:46.440
to retrieve the body\Nbecause of ice.

27:46.779 --> 27:48.039
Who is she?

27:48.039 --> 27:49.910
Her name is Jo Soo Jin.

27:49.910 --> 27:51.210
A 28-year-old.

27:51.210 --> 27:52.309
She got married\Nthree weeks ago,

27:52.309 --> 27:54.279
but no one heard from her\Nafter her honeymoon.

27:54.279 --> 27:55.350
What's the cause of death?

27:55.680 --> 27:56.719
She drowned.

27:56.719 --> 27:58.950
There was no sign of\Ndrugs or resistance.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.519
It's probably\Nan accident or a suicide.

28:05.789 --> 28:07.559
What about the guy\Nwe got at the mall?

28:08.430 --> 28:10.870
How did he end up\Nwith Ms. Jo's card?

28:12.940 --> 28:14.469
How many do you have?

28:17.569 --> 28:18.840
Where did you get these?

28:19.739 --> 28:23.009
I borrowed them from\Nmy sister-in-law.

28:24.579 --> 28:27.420
How can that make\Nany sense?

28:28.479 --> 28:29.789
It can.

28:30.049 --> 28:31.920
He's Ms. Jo's\Ncousin-in-law.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.289
Are those her stuff?

28:34.289 --> 28:35.289
Yes.

28:56.249 --> 28:57.850
His alibi\Nis pretty solid too.

28:57.850 --> 29:00.479
He and his girlfriend\Ncleaned out the duty-free,

29:00.680 --> 29:02.049
with Ms. Jo's credit card.

29:02.620 --> 29:04.519
That means he knew...

29:04.620 --> 29:06.090
she couldn't report\Nthe card as missing.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.400
Something is weird.

29:17.430 --> 29:18.469
What is?

29:18.600 --> 29:19.640
Hello?

29:20.440 --> 29:21.499
Yes.

29:22.340 --> 29:23.440
Detective Ha.

29:24.710 --> 29:26.239
It's a call from\Nthe victim's friend.

29:41.390 --> 29:45.059
Yes, Ms. Jo\Nwas found dead.

30:10.819 --> 30:11.890
What about her husband?

30:12.749 --> 30:15.259
Where's her husband?

30:23.170 --> 30:25.170
He's at a hotel\Nwith another woman...

30:25.170 --> 30:26.969
even before his wife's\Nfuneral is over.

30:27.069 --> 30:28.469
What a jerk.

30:28.469 --> 30:31.140
Are you sure\Nit wasn't the husband?

30:31.140 --> 30:34.039
No, he has a solid alibi.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.779
You can go first.\NI have some business.

30:37.180 --> 30:40.249
Okay. Be careful.

30:40.249 --> 30:41.350
This is suspicious.

30:41.620 --> 30:42.620
Right?

30:42.620 --> 30:44.549
It's definitely murder\Ninvolving their affair.

30:44.549 --> 30:46.049
No, that bag.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.890
That bag was\Nlimited edition.

30:48.190 --> 30:50.289
I need to ask her\Nwhere she got it.

30:50.759 --> 30:52.759
It's not the time\Nfor you to shop.

30:53.630 --> 30:54.630
I'm not going to\Nask you to buy it,

30:54.630 --> 30:55.660
so don't worry.

30:55.660 --> 30:57.029
Then just ask her\Nif you want to know.

30:57.029 --> 30:59.200
Excuse me.\NWhere did you...

30:59.940 --> 31:01.100
What?

31:04.039 --> 31:05.769
Ms. Jo also had...

31:06.069 --> 31:08.039
that limited edition bag.

31:10.579 --> 31:11.610
This is...

31:12.009 --> 31:13.380
a marriage fraud.

31:23.329 --> 31:24.329
Look.

31:24.590 --> 31:26.259
I see a lot of\Nfamiliar faces.

31:27.499 --> 31:28.600
This guy.

31:28.729 --> 31:29.769
Where?

31:29.999 --> 31:31.029
And him.

31:31.999 --> 31:34.539
I saved this and\Nlooked at them every day.

31:34.539 --> 31:35.670
Wanted men?

31:36.509 --> 31:38.239
Are you saying they're\Na criminal organization...

31:38.239 --> 31:40.640
because they were seen\Nin this wedding picture?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.479
- It is an organization.\N- What organization?

31:42.479 --> 31:43.880
It's an organized\Nmarriage fraud.

31:44.309 --> 31:45.509
A marriage fraud?

31:48.749 --> 31:51.819
How did you\Nfirst meet your husband?

31:52.819 --> 31:54.960
We met at\NB and P Beauty Center.

32:03.029 --> 32:04.200
And 1, 2, 3.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.400
Can you hear me?

32:07.069 --> 32:10.069
It's a perfect place\Nto find their victim.

32:10.069 --> 32:12.239
Of course. It's perfect.

32:12.940 --> 32:15.140
I see it often on\NMs. Jo's card statement.

32:15.309 --> 32:16.910
B and P Beauty Center.

32:17.779 --> 32:19.279
They are\Nhighly confidential,

32:20.049 --> 32:21.819
and it's hard to get\Na membership there.

32:22.319 --> 32:23.590
She went there often.

32:31.930 --> 32:33.960
Did your husband\Ngo to a beauty center?

32:34.860 --> 32:35.900
No.

32:36.059 --> 32:37.170
Then?

32:37.430 --> 32:38.600
Excuse me.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.769
Who can I see to\Nget a consultation?

32:42.100 --> 32:43.539
I'll show you the way.

32:43.569 --> 32:44.569
It's over there.

32:44.569 --> 32:46.779
My mother-in-law\Nis a regular there.

32:46.779 --> 32:48.279
I'll show you the way.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.410
It's not easy to find\Non your first time.

32:52.249 --> 32:54.219
I was rather lonely\Nbecause my mom...

32:54.219 --> 32:55.650
passed away\Nwhen I was a kid.

32:55.719 --> 32:58.819
She must've treated you\Nlike you're her own.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.590
You're right.

33:01.289 --> 33:03.430
She also lost\Nher own daughter,

33:03.430 --> 33:05.690
so she took me in\Nlike her own daughter.

33:07.229 --> 33:08.329
Miss.

33:08.329 --> 33:10.769
Next time, you should\Ncome with your mom.

33:10.769 --> 33:12.829
They give you\Na family discount.

33:12.969 --> 33:14.340
She passed away...

33:15.239 --> 33:16.340
when I was young.

33:18.239 --> 33:20.610
Nam Bok Soon.\N12 previous charges.

33:20.940 --> 33:22.340
Insurance fraud,\Nmortgage fraud,

33:22.340 --> 33:24.410
real estate fraud,\Ndocument forgery,

33:24.410 --> 33:26.150
stamp forgery, and illegal\Nuse of others' names.

33:26.549 --> 33:28.650
She's done everything\Nin the fraud industry.

33:29.350 --> 33:31.850
They're also known as\NBok Soon Gang.

33:32.789 --> 33:33.860
Then...

33:35.390 --> 33:37.529
may I just\Ncall you as mother?

33:38.489 --> 33:39.759
Of course.

33:39.999 --> 33:42.160
Call me your mom\Nwhenever you want.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.229
I got myself a daughter.

33:45.799 --> 33:48.600
- Hey, look at this.\N- That's pretty.

33:50.039 --> 33:51.110
Look.

33:51.110 --> 33:52.610
It looks great on you.

33:54.110 --> 33:56.650
This feels so great.

33:58.479 --> 34:00.519
Isn't it better to\Ndo this together?

34:01.950 --> 34:03.219
It's great, Mother.

34:03.620 --> 34:05.650
That was great.

34:05.650 --> 34:08.360
Let's go over there.

34:11.659 --> 34:13.400
How could you\Ndo this to me?

34:13.460 --> 34:15.059
I'm sorry, but...

34:15.659 --> 34:16.728
my mom...

34:18.228 --> 34:19.998
wants that bag back.

34:32.309 --> 34:34.018
Drink it\Nwhile it's still hot.

34:39.018 --> 34:40.059
It's delicious.

34:40.059 --> 34:41.659
I made that quince tea.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.429
It's so good.

34:43.530 --> 34:46.400
What a precious painting.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.498
You gave me\Nsuch a beautiful bag.

34:49.498 --> 34:51.228
This is a limited edition.

34:51.599 --> 34:53.940
You and I share\Na similar taste.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.099
I think so.

34:57.769 --> 34:58.769
Excuse me.

35:00.039 --> 35:01.240
Who is it?

35:01.240 --> 35:02.909
Is your car 7853?

35:03.550 --> 35:05.179
- Yes, it is.\N- There's a problem.

35:05.179 --> 35:07.280
I'm sorry,\NI bumped into your car.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.280
What?

35:13.789 --> 35:15.059
I'll be right out.

35:17.090 --> 35:18.889
- I'm sorry.\N- It's okay.

35:18.889 --> 35:20.729
I'll see where we could\Nhang the painting.

35:20.860 --> 35:22.229
I'll be right back.

35:36.979 --> 35:38.909
Lady,\Ndid you find something?

35:39.579 --> 35:40.579
Hurry up.

35:41.280 --> 35:44.050
Her bag is big and old.\NIt's suspicious.

35:46.889 --> 35:48.990
Her clothes and shoes are\Nalways new though.

35:49.630 --> 35:51.559
This will look great\Non you.

35:51.559 --> 35:53.400
It'll go well\Nwith your style.

35:56.229 --> 35:57.729
My goodness.

36:12.809 --> 36:14.380
(Jo Soo Jin)

36:19.420 --> 36:20.420
(Jo Soo Jin)

36:20.420 --> 36:21.760
(Ahn Soo Jung)

36:23.789 --> 36:26.300
(Joeun Bank)

36:28.300 --> 36:29.829
(Jo Soo Jin)

36:32.670 --> 36:34.099
(Power of attorney)

36:34.099 --> 36:35.300
As soon as they married,

36:35.300 --> 36:37.369
they opened accounts\Nwith the wife's name.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.710
She found out later\Nthat she was...

36:39.710 --> 36:41.010
so much in debt,

36:41.139 --> 36:42.380
and that's why\Nshe committed suicide.

36:42.510 --> 36:44.010
She was betrayed...

36:44.010 --> 36:45.409
by her husband\Nand mother-in-law.

36:45.409 --> 36:47.820
They took advantages\Nof loopholes in the law,

36:47.820 --> 36:49.349
and avoided suspicion.

36:49.449 --> 36:50.590
They were married,

36:50.749 --> 36:52.749
but they hadn't filed\Nthe paper yet.

36:52.820 --> 36:54.659
Lady, it's dangerous.\NCome out quickly.

36:59.460 --> 37:00.659
This isn't enough.

37:00.829 --> 37:03.130
I need something certain.

37:08.800 --> 37:09.869
You called me, didn't you?

37:09.970 --> 37:11.769
I'm on the phone\Nwith my insurance company.

37:11.769 --> 37:13.309
I'll finish this call\Nand come out.

37:13.309 --> 37:15.309
You know the location,\Nright?

37:15.380 --> 37:16.710
Please come quickly.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.079
How did this happen?

37:19.409 --> 37:21.280
I'm so sorry. I was\Nlost in thoughts.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.190
It doesn't look like\Nyou rammed into...

37:23.190 --> 37:24.320
It looks like your car is\Nbrand new.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.550
Just...

37:25.550 --> 37:27.720
- back it up.\N- It's smoking though.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.929
First, back up your car.

37:29.929 --> 37:31.130
The insurance company...

37:31.130 --> 37:32.559
told me to wait here\Nafter taking a photo.

37:32.559 --> 37:34.030
Let me take\Nsome pictures first.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.420
Is your car 7853?

38:03.090 --> 38:05.260
The account number\Nfor the fake deposit.

38:05.559 --> 38:06.960
7853.

38:59.510 --> 39:01.420
Lady. Come out quickly.

39:01.650 --> 39:02.650
She just went in.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.550
Hurry up. Come out.

39:21.300 --> 39:22.670
What happened?

39:23.510 --> 39:25.840
What? It was nothing.

39:28.340 --> 39:30.550
What a great timing.

39:31.479 --> 39:33.150
I told you about him,\Nright?

39:33.820 --> 39:34.979
This is my son.

39:42.519 --> 39:44.030
I object to this marriage!

39:44.030 --> 39:45.130
(3 weeks after,\Nthe day of the wedding)

39:45.130 --> 39:46.190
This can't happen.

39:47.460 --> 39:48.630
This can't be!

39:49.059 --> 39:50.130
No way!

39:50.499 --> 39:52.030
This wedding is annulled!

39:53.940 --> 39:55.099
Who are you...

39:55.340 --> 39:57.470
to make a scene\Nat their wedding?

39:58.539 --> 39:59.539
Me?

39:59.639 --> 40:01.179
I'm Seodong's Sniffer.

40:02.210 --> 40:03.210
What's going on?

40:03.349 --> 40:05.110
Serial fraud,\Nspecial robbery,

40:05.280 --> 40:07.050
violating financial law,

40:07.280 --> 40:08.449
forging\Nofficial documents,

40:08.519 --> 40:10.019
aiding\Nand abetting suicide.

40:10.019 --> 40:11.519
You're under arrest\Nfor all of the above.

40:11.590 --> 40:13.019
Don't move!

40:13.019 --> 40:14.659
What proof do you have?

40:15.159 --> 40:17.130
Why are you ruining\Nthis wedding?

40:17.130 --> 40:18.130
Proof?

40:19.229 --> 40:20.300
That bag.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.499
What about this bag?

40:24.869 --> 40:25.869
Mother.

40:26.030 --> 40:28.340
You dropped a seal\Non the floor.

40:39.150 --> 40:40.150
Sweetheart.

40:40.650 --> 40:42.519
Let's go somewhere safe.

40:42.519 --> 40:45.590
No, Mother. I'll escort\Nyou to the police station.

40:45.590 --> 40:47.059
- What?\N- Gosh!

40:48.420 --> 40:49.729
It stings!

40:52.559 --> 40:53.860
Gosh!

40:55.929 --> 40:56.929
Are you...

40:57.300 --> 40:58.699
with that detective?

40:58.699 --> 40:59.800
What do you mean?

41:00.400 --> 41:01.900
We're not that close.

41:05.840 --> 41:06.979
What's going on?

41:07.210 --> 41:08.210
Well...

41:08.510 --> 41:10.249
I'm a police officer.

41:12.079 --> 41:13.650
Are you crazy?

41:14.079 --> 41:16.789
I'm...\NI'm a police officer.

41:18.550 --> 41:20.490
I told you wedding\Nwas dangerous.

41:20.490 --> 41:22.860
Then how can we arrest\Nthis gang?

41:22.860 --> 41:24.460
You're too reckless.

41:24.460 --> 41:27.400
Why did you come here\Nalone? You're reckless.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.260
How can I do nothing\Nwhen you're abducted?

41:30.530 --> 41:32.599
What's that mole\Nunder your eye?

41:38.210 --> 41:39.470
Gosh.

41:40.539 --> 41:41.679
Are you crazy?

41:44.909 --> 41:45.909
Come on.

42:03.829 --> 42:04.929
Gosh.

42:06.199 --> 42:08.440
Take that. You jerks.

42:08.539 --> 42:09.840
Gosh.

42:12.170 --> 42:14.840
Hey, Wan Seung. I'm here!

42:15.539 --> 42:17.949
- Mr. Bae.\N- Why are you so late?

42:18.010 --> 42:20.679
I had to bring this.

42:20.679 --> 42:21.949
(Arrest warrant)

42:25.289 --> 42:26.289
You're all dead.

42:26.289 --> 42:28.220
Mr. Bae is here.

42:28.220 --> 42:30.889
Bring it on.

42:30.889 --> 42:33.559
Why are there\Nso many of them?

42:43.570 --> 42:45.139
Mr. Bae is the best.

42:46.539 --> 42:48.440
I better get in.

42:58.820 --> 43:00.090
Come on.

43:03.760 --> 43:04.789
He's pretty good.

43:05.389 --> 43:07.130
Bring it. Bring it on.

43:17.039 --> 43:19.409
Mother.\NWhere are you going?

43:22.710 --> 43:23.780
You wench.

43:24.349 --> 43:26.820
I bought you\Nall those luxury bags.

43:26.820 --> 43:28.579
Calm down.

43:44.829 --> 43:45.829
Lady.

43:45.999 --> 43:47.099

44:23.570 --> 44:25.240
That's my woman!

44:25.240 --> 44:27.409
- Hurry.\N- Get the car.

44:28.139 --> 44:29.380
Where do you think\Nyou're going?

44:30.979 --> 44:32.749
Hey! Let go of her.

44:33.220 --> 44:34.979
- Let me go! Wan Seung!\N- Gosh.

44:37.920 --> 44:39.150
You can't go anywhere.

44:39.519 --> 44:40.690
You punk.

44:40.820 --> 44:41.889
Lady!

44:53.139 --> 44:54.340
Stop there, you punk.

44:56.440 --> 44:57.769
Are you okay?

45:00.409 --> 45:02.510
Hey! Stop!

45:07.179 --> 45:08.349
Hurry up and get in.

45:23.929 --> 45:25.470
- What?\N- What's wrong with this?

45:25.570 --> 45:27.840
What's wrong with this?\NThis is unusual.

45:28.599 --> 45:30.139
Of all timing?

45:31.809 --> 45:33.039
That's my groom.

45:54.699 --> 45:56.670
You called him your groom\Nso naturally.

45:56.999 --> 45:58.630
Look. Your groom is dead.

46:04.909 --> 46:05.909
Gosh!

46:06.510 --> 46:08.440
You'll die if you ride\Na bike like that.

46:08.440 --> 46:09.849
Gosh, mister.

46:09.849 --> 46:11.479
How unlucky it is\Nfor you to get arrested...

46:11.479 --> 46:13.249

46:13.249 --> 46:14.420
No, wait.

46:16.789 --> 46:19.289
Lady, what are you doing?

46:26.860 --> 46:28.300
We can't chase them\Nwith that car.

46:28.300 --> 46:29.499
Get in.

46:29.869 --> 46:31.599
I know you don't have\Na license.

46:32.599 --> 46:35.599
I can't do this,\Nbut I can do this.

46:35.599 --> 46:37.309
I already got\Na driving license...

46:37.309 --> 46:38.639
to ride a sidecar when I\Nbecome a policewoman.

46:38.639 --> 46:40.409
Not every policeperson\Ncan drive a sidecar.

Are you going\Nto hop in or not?

46:50.820 --> 46:51.849

46:53.190 --> 46:54.460
Are you really sure?

You're sure, right?

47:07.699 --> 47:10.269
- Are you here?\N- Drive faster!

47:10.269 --> 47:11.710
Be quiet.

47:12.639 --> 47:14.539
Run them over.

47:20.979 --> 47:22.019
What?

47:26.920 --> 47:28.090
Oh, goodness.

47:33.460 --> 47:34.499
Turn on the hazard lights.

47:34.499 --> 47:36.059
Hurry up!

47:41.570 --> 47:42.970
He must be crazy.

47:43.440 --> 47:45.139
He keeps coming after us.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.249
Drive faster!

47:56.690 --> 47:59.490
Stop! Stop!

48:08.559 --> 48:09.729
Did you see?

48:10.869 --> 48:12.199
You're good at driving.

48:33.260 --> 48:34.659
Drive faster.

48:38.329 --> 48:40.499
- Hey!\N- Hey, jerks!

48:40.499 --> 48:42.599
- Hey!\N- Goodness.

48:43.170 --> 48:44.729
What is he trying to do?

48:47.699 --> 48:48.900
Gosh, move.

48:51.170 --> 48:52.639
- Goodness.\N- Gosh.

49:07.789 --> 49:10.260
Get out. Get out already.

49:22.039 --> 49:24.409
Come here, you punks.

49:25.639 --> 49:26.639

49:27.179 --> 49:28.179
What's that?

49:29.280 --> 49:33.019
You're dead meat!

49:51.769 --> 49:53.999
- Take out your gear.\N- Hey.

Are you okay?

50:25.599 --> 50:26.769
Be quiet already.

50:26.840 --> 50:28.940
Kill him.

50:48.289 --> 50:50.360
Why is he trying to make\Ngirls fall for him again?

51:15.420 --> 51:16.619
- Come over here.\N- Gosh.

51:20.289 --> 51:22.260
- Let go!\N- You punk!

51:27.130 --> 51:28.999
- Darn you.\N- Hey, hey.

51:44.409 --> 51:45.579
It surprised me.

51:45.710 --> 51:47.220
Have you been bald\Nall along?

51:47.220 --> 51:48.249
Honey, that's not true.

51:48.249 --> 51:49.550
You fooled people\Nwith your hair too.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.720
- Gosh.\N- Honey, it's not true.

51:52.690 --> 51:55.360
How dare you yank your\Nmother-in-law's hair?

51:55.360 --> 51:58.659
How dare you challenge\Nthe government authority?

51:58.829 --> 51:59.960
You...

52:06.470 --> 52:07.970
Let go of this now.

52:08.499 --> 52:09.970
Everything is over.

52:13.579 --> 52:15.079
Did you like money\Nthat much?

52:15.809 --> 52:17.050
Enough to replace...

52:17.909 --> 52:19.150
people's lives for it?

52:32.329 --> 52:33.429
Move faster.

52:34.630 --> 52:37.099
- Mom! Wait.\N- Let go.

52:37.099 --> 52:38.369
Goodness.

52:38.999 --> 52:40.099
Goodness seriously.

52:40.099 --> 52:41.269
Move.

52:41.269 --> 52:42.539
Let go of me!

52:42.599 --> 52:45.010
Let go of me! Let go!

52:45.210 --> 52:47.679
Hey, you. That's my wig.

52:47.679 --> 52:50.110
Give me back my wig.\NGive it back!

52:50.510 --> 52:51.550

53:00.559 --> 53:02.659
Let go. Do you know\Nwho I am?

53:02.659 --> 53:03.729
Get in.

53:22.610 --> 53:25.050
Dead brides must've\Nfelt so resentful.

53:26.010 --> 53:28.320
They must've dreamed of\Na happy newlywed life.

53:29.889 --> 53:32.050
This is why\NI don't get married.

53:45.170 --> 53:46.199

53:46.570 --> 53:48.769
It's not good for others'\Neyes to see your legs.

53:48.900 --> 53:50.010
No, thanks.

53:50.539 --> 53:52.610
I know you'll see me again\Nusing that as an excuse.

53:53.079 --> 53:54.840
I hate clingy people.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.610
Throw it away or sell it.\NI don't care.

53:56.610 --> 53:58.949
And you'll sue me\Nfor destruction?

53:58.949 --> 54:01.179
You'd cause harm to others\Nby exposing your legs.

54:01.179 --> 54:02.479
It should be considered\Nas pollution.

54:02.479 --> 54:05.019
It's false information\Nand defamation.

54:05.019 --> 54:06.760
I said the truth, so it's\Nnot false information.

54:06.760 --> 54:07.760
That's adding contempt\Nto your charges.

54:07.760 --> 54:10.159
Mr. Kim, take this woman\Nto the police station.

54:10.229 --> 54:11.729

Welcome. Are you\Nlooking for a house?

54:32.610 --> 54:34.920

He's out right now.

There's a weird woman\Nin my neighborhood,

54:44.460 --> 54:46.090
and the rent is\Nunbelievably high.

54:46.329 --> 54:48.360
I heard Joongjin-dong is\Ncheap. I'm moving there.

54:48.429 --> 54:49.729
Goodness.

54:49.729 --> 54:52.470
Why are you looking for\Nthat in Yeouido?

54:52.470 --> 54:54.699
You know a lot of people.

55:03.749 --> 55:05.579

still after that case?

55:34.380 --> 55:36.079
You caught the murderer.

55:53.260 --> 55:54.699
Nothing was ever found.

55:56.130 --> 55:57.229
But I'm sure it has...

55:58.570 --> 56:00.940
something to do with\NSeo Hyun Soo's death.

56:11.010 --> 56:12.479
- What's wrong?\N- One second.

Didn't you see her?

57:03.070 --> 57:05.070

57:06.269 --> 57:07.440

Of course.\NShe feels bad...

57:10.510 --> 57:11.740
for taking that ring.

There's something to this.

someone who works\Nin Baebang-dong.

59:20.639 --> 59:23.670
