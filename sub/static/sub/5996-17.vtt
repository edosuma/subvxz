WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.703
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 All right, here we go, yo!

00:02.735 --> 00:04.172
As you know,
 Michael proposed to Jane

00:04.205 --> 00:06.174
and a wedding date was set.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.242
Did you make the reservations
for the chair rentals?

00:08.276 --> 00:09.543
I'm working on it.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.712
Exciting, right?
 Not as exciting:

00:11.745 --> 00:13.647
Xiomara and Rogelio broke up.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.317
Oh, and the Villanuevas' house
 flooded!

00:16.350 --> 00:18.119
Bright side: thanks to Rafael,

00:18.152 --> 00:20.154
the family got to stay
 at the Marbella.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.255
And speaking of Rafael,
 his half brother

00:21.289 --> 00:23.324
Derek is back in town.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.358
Don't go off with him alone.

00:24.392 --> 00:27.128
And Raf was working
 with Detective Michael

00:27.161 --> 00:28.696
to see if Derek was connected
 to their mother...

00:28.729 --> 00:30.831
Where were you?
Right here. On this boat.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.567
...the notorious crime lord
 known as "Mutter."

00:33.601 --> 00:35.269
And, oh, yeah, he also just had
 twin girls with Petra,

00:35.303 --> 00:38.539
and truthfully
 Petra's not doing so great.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.808
NURSE:
And does postpartum depression
run in your family?

00:40.841 --> 00:43.077
Do you ever have thoughts
 of running away?

00:43.111 --> 00:45.146
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I know! Mama drama, right?

00:45.179 --> 00:47.581
So let's dive in.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.284
As you all know,
 Jane Gloriana Villanueva

00:50.318 --> 00:52.453
didn't lose control very often.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.587
(loud dance music playing)

00:53.621 --> 00:55.423
But when she did...

00:55.456 --> 00:57.491
Oh, when she did...

00:57.525 --> 01:00.694
(gunshot, guests screaming)

01:00.728 --> 01:03.631
...it was epic.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.465
Ah, yes.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.302
You'll recall
 Jane's 21st birthday.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.704
The night she
 and Michael first met.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.873
But what you don't know

01:12.906 --> 01:15.176
is what happened
 after that kiss.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.710
Don't get into
any more trouble.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.212
I won't.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.284
But call me, okay?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.518
I will.

01:30.924 --> 01:34.395
(knocking at door)

01:34.428 --> 01:36.464
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 He couldn't
 bring himself to leave!

01:36.497 --> 01:38.266
It's so romantic!

01:38.299 --> 01:40.634
So, one of your friends

01:40.668 --> 01:42.170
is passed out on your porch.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.371
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.406
Not quite as romantic.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.243
That's not my friend.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.844
It's my mom.

01:51.845 --> 01:52.813
Here, let me help you.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.482
It's okay, I got it.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.716
Ma! Come on, wake up.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.151
Huh?

01:58.686 --> 02:01.889
Oh, hey, Officer!
(giggles)

02:01.922 --> 02:04.225
You can put those
cuffs on me any...

02:04.258 --> 02:05.659
(Xiomara vomiting)
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.861
That party was
 out of control...

02:07.895 --> 02:10.764
which is why Jane
 is taking control

02:10.798 --> 02:12.466
of her bachelorette party.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.901
And after mani-pedis,

02:13.934 --> 02:16.370
we'll have dinner
from 7:00 to 10:00.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.738
Strictly prohibited:

02:17.771 --> 02:19.807
strip clubs, cheesy bars,
penis stuff.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.642
Wow, this looks great.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.910
Thank you, Lina.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.478
Don't thank me.
You wrote it.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.947
True. Oh, which
reminds me...

02:26.980 --> 02:30.918
I made a seating
chart for dinner.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.886
I just have so many
different groups,

02:32.920 --> 02:34.788
I want to make sure
everyone melds.
 Don "Key-sotty"?

02:34.822 --> 02:35.956
JANE:
 Don Quixote.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.525
Oh.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.926
It's reading for
this week's class.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.528
It's a really great book.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.263
It's about this guy
who sees the world

02:42.296 --> 02:44.532
as if it's one of his
great romances and...

02:44.565 --> 02:46.500
I'm out.
Okay.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.701
Is this the seating chart?

02:47.735 --> 02:49.537
Yep. All right,
last chance, Abuela.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.871
Do you want to come?

02:55.976 --> 02:56.777
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Hard to argue with that.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.982
Or that.
Stop. Jane wants me there.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.685
Okay, I should drop off
Mateo with Rafael

03:04.718 --> 03:06.420
before my shift starts.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.621
And thank you both.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.357
You know, for
not pushing back

03:09.390 --> 03:10.691
and just letting me have

03:10.724 --> 03:12.226
the bachelorette that I want.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.594
Of course.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.795
It's your party.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.330
Bye!

03:16.364 --> 03:17.998
Bye!
Bye!

03:18.031 --> 03:19.433
(gasps)

03:21.269 --> 03:22.470
Do you think she
suspects anything?

03:22.503 --> 03:23.671
Definitely not.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.607
(squeals)
Yes!

03:26.640 --> 03:28.909
Thank you so much, ladies.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.411
Surprise!

03:30.444 --> 03:31.745
Uh...

03:31.779 --> 03:33.414
(chuckles)

03:33.447 --> 03:34.615
Oh, my God, Jane!

03:34.648 --> 03:36.317
We're so happy
to see you!

03:37.017 --> 03:38.686
We missed you
so much!

03:38.719 --> 03:40.354
Oh, really?

03:40.388 --> 03:42.590
That's so sweet.
Yeah!

03:42.623 --> 03:45.493
So maybe you can
convince Rogelio

03:45.526 --> 03:47.295
to invest in our fashion blog.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.996
He thinks you're some kind
of genius or something.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.431
It's all about...

03:50.464 --> 03:51.799
BOTH:
Seeing Double!

03:52.900 --> 03:54.368
Wow.

03:54.402 --> 03:55.869
Neat.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.872
See? Jane agrees that
it's an awesome idea.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.608
It makes perfect sense for
you to give whatever money

04:00.641 --> 04:02.576
you were going to give to us
for college to fund it.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.844
ROGELIO:
Jane...

04:03.877 --> 04:06.347
Please. Help.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.749
Explain to them,
in the unlikely event

04:08.782 --> 04:10.884
Seeing Double doesn't catch on,

04:10.918 --> 04:12.886
it's always good
to have a backup plan.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.488
Oh, y-yeah.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.557
Well, I-I'm a big
proponent of college.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.024
Oh, there's a prospective
student program

04:18.058 --> 04:19.860
at my school today,
if you want to come by.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.563
Check out the sitch.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.031
That is
a wonderful idea!

04:24.064 --> 04:25.299
They will be there.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.834
If they want me

04:26.867 --> 04:28.035
to even consider

04:28.068 --> 04:29.036
investing
in their blog.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.371
BOTH:
Fine.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.372
Great. Well, I have to run.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.172
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.608
Girls, you haven't
congratulated Jane

04:34.642 --> 04:37.511
on her engagement to
the greatest man in the world.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.913
Oh, my God,
you're marrying Rafael?!

04:39.947 --> 04:41.915
That's amazing!
Oh, you're
so lucky!
No.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.451
He's so sexy.
He's so gorgeous
and rich.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.852
No, that's...
And those abs...

04:44.885 --> 04:46.387
No, I said no!

04:46.420 --> 04:47.588
I am not marrying Rafael.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.723
I am marrying Michael.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.492
Oh.
Huh?

04:51.525 --> 04:52.726
Oh. Okay.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.894
He seems...

04:53.927 --> 04:55.863
loyal.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.898
Yes.
Yeah.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.067
Sorry we can't make it
to your wedding.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.603
Yeah, we're just
super busy that day.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.938
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I'll point out,
 they don't know when it is.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.541
Congrats, though.
Thanks.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.876
It's always a treat,
seeing you girls.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.077
I'm off, Dad.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.679
No, please.
Just make sure

05:11.712 --> 05:13.947
Michael got the invite
reminder for tonight.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.816
I never heard from him.

05:15.849 --> 05:16.984
Maybe they didn't go through.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.552
I'll send it to you, too.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.588
(giggles nervously, sighs)

05:20.621 --> 05:21.955
MICHAEL:
 Oh, no, he sent it to you, too.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.691
JANE:
 I'm getting it.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.627
Hang on.
Oh, you really
don't have to see it.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.831
(maniacal laugh)

05:30.864 --> 05:32.099
I'm sorry, but I really do.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.568
MICHAEL:
Throw your hands up in the air

05:34.602 --> 05:35.969
and wave 'em like
you just don't care

05:36.003 --> 05:38.472
because it's my bachelor party!
Woot! Woot!

05:40.007 --> 05:41.975
Is that your voice?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.444
He made me record it.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.112
Michael, I'm so sorry.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.113
Yeah.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.615
(laughs)
I can't believe

05:47.648 --> 05:49.583
my dad's going
to your bachelor party.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.584
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah, me neither.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.752
Here's what happened.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.721
I remember it
 like it was a week ago.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.524
So, are there gonna
be strippers?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.158
Do you not want there
to be strippers?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.860
No, no, it's okay.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.529
I mean,
it's your bachelor party.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.930
Well, if you don't want
there to be strippers...

06:02.963 --> 06:04.465
Okay, fine, fine,
you convinced me,

06:04.498 --> 06:06.066
no strippers at
your bachelor party.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.536
ROGELIO:
You're having
a bachelor party?

06:10.070 --> 06:12.105
And I'm not invited?

06:12.139 --> 06:14.675
No. Did you...
Oh, he must not have...

06:14.708 --> 06:15.909
Did you...
you didn't get the e-mail.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.579
Man, my friends are so flaky.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.780
(laughs)

06:19.813 --> 06:22.616
Oh... thank God!

06:22.650 --> 06:24.885
'Cause for a minute,
I was like, "My best brogelio

06:24.918 --> 06:26.053
"doesn't want me

06:26.086 --> 06:29.957
at his bachelor party?"

06:29.990 --> 06:31.559
What's up, brother?
Yeah.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.193
JANE:
 So...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.563
what if I called my dad
and told him not to go?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.931
And you call my mom
and tell her not to come?

06:37.965 --> 06:39.867
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah, that's not happening.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.869
What? A girl can dream.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.871
It's too late. He's already
taking over the planning.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.673
Which could be good.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.207
I mean, let's face it,
if it weren't for Rogelio,

06:47.240 --> 06:48.776
it would probably be
me and my friends

06:48.809 --> 06:50.110
eating tacos over a trash can.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.013
Why are you so sweet?

06:53.046 --> 06:55.649
To me, to my dad...

06:55.683 --> 06:57.785
Save it for the vows.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.152
Printer deadline's
Friday, right?

06:59.186 --> 07:00.754
Mm-hmm.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.690
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I should explain.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.659
In a Catholic mass,
 you can't recite your own vows,

07:05.693 --> 07:07.060
so theirs were going to be
 printed in the programs.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.496
So, how's yours going?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.063
Oh, it's great. Great, yeah.

07:10.097 --> 07:10.964
You?

07:10.998 --> 07:12.199
Yeah, just ironing out

07:12.232 --> 07:13.934
the last details.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.235
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Sure, if you call

07:15.268 --> 07:17.505
19 pages of general ideas

07:17.538 --> 07:19.039
"ironing out the last details."

07:19.072 --> 07:21.208
Wait, scratch that...
 23 pages, actually.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.576
Jane?

07:22.610 --> 07:25.513
Professor Blake, hello.
Hey.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.947
So, last minute, but, uh,

07:26.980 --> 07:28.682
one of the T.A.s
who was supposed to speak

07:28.716 --> 07:30.551
to prospective students
just canceled.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.985
I know you just
started office hours,

07:32.019 --> 07:34.087
but is there any way
you could fill in for her?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.989
Oh, my God.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.692
Uh, I would love to,
thank you so much!

07:38.726 --> 07:40.694
Just remember...
keep it professional.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.096
Don't worry.
Professional, got it.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.065
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which brings us here, now.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.535
And as we dive into
our section on Don Quixote,

07:47.568 --> 07:49.537
it's great seeing them
connect to the material

07:49.570 --> 07:51.705
and relate Quixote's quest

07:51.739 --> 07:53.240
to their own youthful idealism.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.675
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yup.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.943
Youthful idealism at its best.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.210
JANE:
So, if you have any questions,

07:57.244 --> 08:00.080
I am more than happy
to answer them.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.281
Oh.
(knocking at door)

08:01.314 --> 08:02.783
One second.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.920
Hello, I'm looking
for Jane Villanueva.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.889
Yeah, I-I'm Jane Villanueva.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.158
Milady.
Is this a skit

08:11.191 --> 08:12.660
for prospective
students?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.194
Allowest me to
remove my armor.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.596
I'm sorry, who...? Oh!

08:15.629 --> 08:16.797
I am Don Quixote!

08:16.830 --> 08:18.165
Ready to see
what's in

08:18.198 --> 08:20.267
my Sancho Panza?
(students shriek)

08:20.300 --> 08:22.035
No! Oh, wait, wait.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.871
You know, wait,
this is a mistake.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.105
This is
a mistake!

08:25.138 --> 08:26.974
Ah! Oh! No...

08:27.007 --> 08:28.576
Ah... ah!

08:29.643 --> 08:31.545
I'm so sorry!

08:39.352 --> 08:41.221
Professor Blake,
I assure you

08:41.254 --> 08:42.923
I had no idea
this was going to happen.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.157
I'm having a bachelorette
party later tonight,

08:44.191 --> 08:45.559
and it seems my friends

08:45.593 --> 08:46.860
got a bit overzealous.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.062
I am not even
a stripper person,

08:49.096 --> 08:51.198
not that that matters. Believe
me, I'm as angry as you are.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.701
Look, I understand that
the incident wasn't your fault,

08:53.734 --> 08:55.202
but it was
a public event,

08:55.235 --> 08:57.204
pictures were taken,
people were horrified.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.606
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 To be fair,

08:58.639 --> 09:00.073
parents were horrified.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.842
Students were LOLing
 all over Instagram,

09:01.875 --> 09:03.176
or whatever the kids say
 these days.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.645
And I will do whatever it takes

09:04.678 --> 09:05.913
to right the situation.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.615
I know.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.249
But I'm gonna have
to talk to the dean.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.652
I really don't know if you
can continue as a T.A.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.221
I'll check in end of day.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.294
I just need the day to rest.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.864
So if you could take
the babies tonight...

09:23.897 --> 09:24.932
What's wrong?

09:24.965 --> 09:27.034
Nothing, I just, um...

09:27.067 --> 09:29.202
started my medication.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.204
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 For postpartum depression,
 you'll recall.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.607
And it's giving me
a pretty bad migraine.

09:33.641 --> 09:34.808
So can you keep the babies?

09:34.842 --> 09:36.143
Yeah, of course.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.179
Oh, and make sure
I'm not disturbed.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.051
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Uh-oh.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.819
This isn't looking good.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.320
(sighs)

09:47.354 --> 09:49.790
Sorry.

09:49.823 --> 09:50.958
Where were we?

09:50.991 --> 09:52.192
Nowhere.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.894
We got nothing so far.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.663
What about the bug
you put in Derek's office?

09:55.696 --> 09:57.164
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You'll recall these two

09:57.197 --> 09:59.099
have been working together
 to discover--

09:59.132 --> 10:01.301
how shall I put this?
 It's rather nuanced...

10:01.334 --> 10:03.771
Nothing.
 ...whether Rafael's
 brother Derek

10:03.804 --> 10:05.839
is a good guy

10:05.873 --> 10:08.709
or a bad guy.
(growls)

10:08.742 --> 10:10.110
His boat.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.344
There's got to be
something on his boat.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.180
Good, so search his boat.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.848
I-I get a warrant,
he knows you told me about it.

10:14.882 --> 10:15.949
So don't get a warrant.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.252
Oh, come on, Michael.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.255
We both know you're not
above bending the rules.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.192
XIOMARA:
 So did you get a little visit

10:25.225 --> 10:27.127
from Don Quick-Naughty?

10:27.160 --> 10:30.330
You were in on that?
What were you thinking?

10:30.363 --> 10:33.000
Hey, strippers were not
technically on your "no" list.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.335
Just strip clubs.
There's a big difference.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.237
Yeah, well that big difference
just gave me a lap dance

10:37.270 --> 10:39.106
in front of 50 students
and parents.
What?!

10:39.139 --> 10:40.708
I was asked to do
a last-minute talk

10:40.741 --> 10:41.942
to prospective students and...

10:41.975 --> 10:44.244
He was supposed to go
to your office.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.946
I wasn't there. He found me.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.414
I'm sorry.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.416
How could I have known
he would turn out to be,

10:49.449 --> 10:52.085
like, the world's most
industrious stripper?

10:52.119 --> 10:54.421
This is why I implemented

10:54.454 --> 10:56.423
the "no surprise" rule
in the first place.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.424
I was clear.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.926
No surprises.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.830
*

11:04.197 --> 11:05.899
Maybe just one more?

11:05.933 --> 11:07.067
Surprise!

11:07.100 --> 11:08.368
Welcome to your
bachelorette party.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.270
(squealing with excitement,
giggling)

11:14.975 --> 11:16.309
What's going on?

11:16.343 --> 11:19.079
This is not a part
of my carefully detailed

11:19.112 --> 11:20.914
bachelorette party plan.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.917
I know, but your mom and I
decided that we owed it to you

11:23.951 --> 11:25.919
not to throw you the
world's lamest party.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.955
We owed it
to everyone.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.326
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, here we have...

11:33.360 --> 11:35.095
Well, names aren't important.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.930
We've taken care
of everything.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.933
But Mateo is...
With Abuela all night
in a guest room.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.935
And I have to work tomorrow.
Luca's covering
your shift

11:41.969 --> 11:43.804
so you can nurse what'd
better be a raging hangover.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.973
I have to finish my vows.
I called the printers

11:46.006 --> 11:47.941
and got them to agree
to a one-day extension.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.409
And we brought
your party clothes!

11:49.442 --> 11:50.944
XIOMARA: And we're really sorry
about the stripper,

11:50.978 --> 11:52.746
but there's nothing
you can do about it tonight.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.082
Except drink and take your
mind off it. Right, girls?!

11:55.115 --> 11:57.084
(whooping)

11:57.117 --> 11:59.519
Come on, hon.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.722
Wouldn't it feel good to lose
control just this once?

12:04.491 --> 12:06.459
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on,
 Jane, are you going to let down

12:06.493 --> 12:08.161
this group of vaguely
 familiar ladies

12:08.195 --> 12:10.197
who are apparently
 your very good friends?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.466
All right, bring on the shots!

12:13.500 --> 12:15.468
(cheering)

12:15.502 --> 12:17.337
To your last night
of freedom.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.372
(whooping)

12:26.213 --> 12:28.048
HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: Whoo-hoo!

12:28.081 --> 12:30.050
(whoops)

12:30.083 --> 12:32.853
See, isn't this better than
some boring dinner party?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.429
Wow.

12:42.462 --> 12:45.966
Uh, I thought you said
we were just stopping by.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.969
For five scrumptious courses
prepared by my personal chef.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.971
Now sit, sit, everyone, sit.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.572
Open your swag bags.

12:52.605 --> 12:57.477
They contain all the essentials
for an epic bachelor party.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.449
(quietly):
What the hell's happening?

13:02.482 --> 13:04.317
Oh.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.253
Rogelio, you really didn't
have to do this.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.254
Of course I did.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.255
You only get married once.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.289
Right, guys?

13:09.322 --> 13:11.892
Huh?

13:11.925 --> 13:13.260
I need a drink.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.561
Perfect.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.429
I've done
the wine pairings myself.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.333
We'll start with an ice-cold
pink champagne toast.

13:22.903 --> 13:23.871
Oh, I almost forgot.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.472
The pièce de résistance.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.974
Open it.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.047
Oh.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.415
Wow.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.416
(chuckles)

13:36.449 --> 13:37.450
(all chuckling)

13:37.484 --> 13:39.086
Turn it around.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.191
(whoops)

13:44.224 --> 13:45.592
(upbeat music playing)

13:47.995 --> 13:49.229
(whooping)

13:49.262 --> 13:50.898
Yes!

13:50.931 --> 13:52.565
Whoo-hoo!

13:52.599 --> 13:53.566
Angela's amazing.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.567
Did you know she's a genius?

13:54.601 --> 13:56.203
She really is a genius.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.206
Actually, my IQ is 139,
so it's just below.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.207
You see?!

14:00.240 --> 14:01.208
Only a genius would know that.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.275
XIOMARA:
Totally.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.111
(laughing)

14:04.144 --> 14:05.445
(whoops)

14:05.478 --> 14:07.414
*

14:07.447 --> 14:08.982
Whoo-hoo!

14:09.016 --> 14:10.483
All right, I'm signing up
for karaoke.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.185
Sweet Lady Jane?
No!

14:12.219 --> 14:13.220
Yes!
No, no, no!

14:13.253 --> 14:14.554
Who's Sweet Lady Jane?

14:14.587 --> 14:16.089
Xo, it's her Sasha Fierce.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.424
When she gets drunk enough
to freestyle.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.892
You've never seen her like that?

14:18.926 --> 14:20.227
No, I haven't.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.095
But it is definitely
happening tonight.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.197
We need more drinks.
Agreed!
Can you go get them?

14:24.231 --> 14:27.467
I kind of have a history
with Chad the hot bartender.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.139
I don't want it to seem
like I'm chasing him.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.941
I mean, I am chasing him,
but I don't want him to know.

14:33.974 --> 14:34.942
On it!

14:34.975 --> 14:36.576
(whoops)

14:36.609 --> 14:38.345
So where'd you go to college?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.947
Oh, I didn't.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.281
Oh, weird. Why?

14:41.314 --> 14:44.351
It just wasn't, like, my path.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.986
So what do you do?

14:46.019 --> 14:47.487
I'm a waitress with Jane.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.655
But she goes to school.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.657
Well, I-I'm a stylist, too.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.625
I mean, I will be
once that takes off.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.194
So you, like, pick out clothes?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.096
XIOMARA:
A shot for Sweet Lady Jane!

14:56.129 --> 14:58.231
Uh, no, she is not
coming out tonight.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.267
She's definitely coming
out tonight. Drink.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.501
ALL (chanting):
Drink! Drink!

15:01.534 --> 15:04.104
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

15:06.173 --> 15:07.507
Whoo-hoo!

15:07.540 --> 15:09.009
(camera shutter clicking)

15:09.042 --> 15:10.210
Oh, no, no, no. No cameras.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.678
No posting any pictures

15:11.711 --> 15:13.947
on the Twitter, the "Facegram"
or "Instabook."

15:13.981 --> 15:15.983
Hon, you got to relax.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.985
No, Mom, I can't when they're
documenting me on their phones.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.087
I'm already
on thin ice at school.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.989
Okay, everybody,
give me your phones!

15:22.022 --> 15:23.290
What?!

15:23.323 --> 15:25.158
Phone-free
zone, people!

15:25.192 --> 15:26.259
(whoops)

15:26.293 --> 15:29.162
Yeah!
(whoops)

15:29.196 --> 15:30.163
Uh...

15:30.197 --> 15:31.431
Hey, Mom, Mom, Mom.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.966
Why don't you just
pace yourself?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.034
Maybe get you a little
food or something.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.104
Hey, no Old Lady Jane tonight.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.107
I want to meet Sweet Lady Jane!

15:40.140 --> 15:42.475
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Huh, she doesn't look thrilled.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.315
And neither does she.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.684
The best thing you
could do for those girls

15:51.718 --> 15:54.487
is to give them away.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.059
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, dear.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.328
Very suspicious.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.296
Also suspicious...

16:08.235 --> 16:11.638
Looks like Michael decided
 to break the law after all.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.174
And here I'd thought
 he'd changed.

16:16.709 --> 16:20.113
Well, he did change
 his shirt at least.

16:20.780 --> 16:21.748
(gasps)

16:21.781 --> 16:23.250
Nicholas.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.352
Grappa is a digestif.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.521
It's to be sipped, not chugged
like a shot of cheap tequila.

16:31.124 --> 16:34.394
I wish it were cheap tequila.
(laughing): Yeah, boy.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.163
Remember when we road-tripped
to the Redneck Riviera

16:36.196 --> 16:37.564
and Michael got wasted
on mezcal?
No. Stop.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.499
Oh, yeah, the night
he ate the worm.
Shh.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.668
Eating the worm is the least
of what happened that night.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.670
Guys, guys, let's
not bore Rogelio,

16:43.703 --> 16:46.506
my future father-in-law, with
these boring stories, okay?

16:46.539 --> 16:49.042
No, Vincent, finish
your story, please.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.577
What happened in
this Redneck Riviera?

16:50.610 --> 16:51.578
I must know.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.680
Uh, well...

16:53.713 --> 16:56.116
we had a nice talk
about our feelings

16:56.149 --> 16:57.450
and how much we respect women,

16:57.484 --> 16:59.186
and then we all went
to bed by 10:00.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.253
(chuckles)
The end.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.655
That's a weird story, Vincent.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.157
Rogelio.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.660
This dinner, fantastic.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.564
The oysters, the pheasant,
the-the macaroons.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.233
But, uh, maybe
it's time to head out?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.734
Let's do it.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.837
I've gotten us into
the hottest spot in town.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.173
All right.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.742
This Russian bathing ritual
dates back centuries.

17:23.776 --> 17:27.314
The euca leaves really promote
exfoliation and circulation.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.382
You will be glowing
for the wedding, Michael.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.684
You may not even need
a spray tan.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.455
* Macho, macho man

17:35.488 --> 17:38.791
* I've got to be
a macho man... *

17:38.825 --> 17:40.327
Have you
seen my mom?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.129
XIOMARA: Jane!
Ma!

17:42.162 --> 17:44.131
There's my daughter.
They didn't believe I have

17:44.164 --> 17:45.432
a daughter old enough
to get married.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.599
Tell them you're my daughter.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.600
(chuckles)
I'm her daughter.

17:47.634 --> 17:48.735
Mom, I need my phone.

17:48.768 --> 17:49.836
No, no phones.

17:49.869 --> 17:50.837
No, no, Mom, I'm serious.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.272
You see how serious she is?

17:52.305 --> 17:53.440
Mom!
No.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.742
No, no. Phone-free zone!

17:55.775 --> 17:58.711
No, uh, wait, Ma,
where are you going?
To protect you from yourself!

17:58.745 --> 18:00.413
No, Mom, that's not funny!
I'm doing you a favor!

18:00.447 --> 18:02.415
You'll thank me later!
(stammering)

18:02.449 --> 18:04.184
Give it to me!
What do you want to use it for?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.618
You want to do some work?

18:05.652 --> 18:07.487
No, I need to see
if Professor Blake called me

18:07.520 --> 18:08.721
and to see
if I still have my job

18:08.755 --> 18:09.722
because of the stripper
you sent.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.291
Fine.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.293
But I'm holding it.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.295
So you don't go
answering e-mails.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.329
Fine.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.331
JANE:
You see?

18:18.365 --> 18:21.634
Professor Blake left
a voice mail.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.437
Okay, he's just
calling to say...

18:24.471 --> 18:26.839
Oh, my God, I can keep my job!

18:26.873 --> 18:29.476
Yes!
(laughs)

18:29.509 --> 18:32.312
Go, Professor Tight-Ass!
That guy is such a dick.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.447
I thought I was gonna have
to, like, send a stripper

18:34.481 --> 18:36.616
to his house to pull
the pole out of his ass.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.885
FEMALE VOICE:
Would you like to send your
message with normal delivery?

18:38.918 --> 18:40.587
Wait, what message?
Oh, my God, no, no, no.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.255
What happened?
Must've hit "call back."
Stop.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.657
Message sent.
No...

18:53.600 --> 18:56.536
Okay, we need to come up
with a plan.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.238
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Unfortunately,

18:58.271 --> 18:59.639
coming up with a plan
 is quite difficult

18:59.672 --> 19:00.640
when you are...

19:00.673 --> 19:02.242
Well, let's check.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.445
HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: Whoo-hoo!

19:05.478 --> 19:08.281
Don't worry, nobody listens
to their voice mail anymore.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.782
What are you talking about?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.784
Everybody listens
to their voice mails, Ma.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.520
LINA: I've got an idea.
Go.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.587
Let's ask Siri.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.323
Any other suggestions?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.724
Angela, go.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.726
I think if we all
think really hard,

19:19.759 --> 19:21.761
we could delete it
with our minds.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.566
Here's what we're gonna do.

19:26.599 --> 19:27.934
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 This ought to be good.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.502
He's at a party
for prospective students.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.837
I am gonna go to that party

19:30.870 --> 19:32.372
and I am going
to steal his phone

19:32.405 --> 19:33.406
and I'm going to erase
that message.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.807
Wait, you can't
go in there.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.710
You just had
a stripper at school.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.379
Right.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.547
Can you go?

19:40.580 --> 19:41.714
Way too drunk.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.883
Angela, can you go?

19:43.916 --> 19:45.818
Sure. Where?

19:47.854 --> 19:48.955
I know who could go!

19:48.988 --> 19:49.822
(gasps)

19:49.856 --> 19:51.258
I have to pee!

19:52.959 --> 19:54.461
Get in. Hurry.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.895
Not so fast.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.264
Since we're doing you a favor,

19:57.297 --> 19:58.331
we want something in return.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.899
What?! Seriously?

19:59.932 --> 20:01.601
We want to come
to your wedding now.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.403
Great, you're in, twins.
Let's do this.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.637
BOTH:
And be bridesmaids.

20:04.671 --> 20:05.638
What? Why?

20:05.672 --> 20:06.739
You don't even like me.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.341
Yeah, but we could sell the
pictures to some tabloid

20:08.375 --> 20:09.876
because of Rogelio
and fund our blog.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.378
Plus, we'll be wearing
our own designs.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.647
This is our chance to be
like the Olsen twins.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.349
But less depressing.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.551
And without Mary-Kate's
weird old French guy.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.653
Fine, let's go!

20:20.687 --> 20:21.721
Yes!
Awesome!

20:21.754 --> 20:23.456
(gasps)

20:23.490 --> 20:24.657
Break out the booze!

20:24.691 --> 20:25.725
We're doing shots!

20:25.758 --> 20:26.826
No, no shots.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.295
MEN:
 Shot! Shot! Shot!

20:28.328 --> 20:29.729
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Truth be told,

20:29.762 --> 20:31.564
if Derek knew his boat
 was being searched,

20:31.598 --> 20:33.700
he probably wouldn't
 feel so buoyed.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.435
See what I did there?

20:35.468 --> 20:37.437
But alas, he doesn't.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.506
Dude, you don't have to keep
buying us drinks all night.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.007
Hey, brotherly bonding.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.642
And plus, I have
two sleeping babies

20:42.675 --> 20:44.511
and two night nurses
upstairs that yell at me

20:44.544 --> 20:46.713
every time I make noise.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.947
(chuckles)

20:47.980 --> 20:50.016
So, did you consider asking?

20:50.049 --> 20:52.952
Stop, no.
Asking what?

20:52.985 --> 20:54.487
He wants to buy into
this deal I'm looking at.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.523
I told him he should
hit up his rich brother.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.857
Brandon, enough.
All right.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.826
I just am not in a position

20:59.859 --> 21:02.028
to make any investments
right now.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.330
No, of course not.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.334
Let's just call it.
Thanks for the drinks.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.768
We should, uh,
head back to the boat.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.703
No, now, hey,
just, uh, just stay.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.038
Uh, it's weird.
Now, now it seems

21:12.071 --> 21:13.573
like I'm after
your money or something.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.508
No, it doesn't.
It's fine, hey.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.377
Come on, just sit down?

21:17.410 --> 21:18.911
Sit down!

21:18.945 --> 21:20.613
Come on, another round.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.549
Let me at least pay this time.
Hey, put your money away.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.487
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I don't know about you,

21:27.520 --> 21:29.055
but I'm not on board
 with this make-under.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.657
How'd you become
a stylist?

21:30.690 --> 21:31.924
You have to have good taste

21:31.958 --> 21:33.926
so celebrities
want your opinion.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.528
Do any celebrities want yours?

21:35.562 --> 21:36.629
(phone chimes)

21:36.663 --> 21:39.031
LINA: Well, they
will eventually.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.436
(chuckles, sighs)

22:20.039 --> 22:22.609
Enough with the questions!

22:33.085 --> 22:35.888
Up to you,
but I'd lose the towel.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.857
It's not good for your pores.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.726
Hey, you know, I'm feeling,
I'm feeling okay.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.761
Your choice.
After this,

22:41.794 --> 22:43.496
a quick plunge
in the cold pool and massages.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.798
Space is limited,
so be sure to tell me

22:45.832 --> 22:47.834
who you want as your couples
massage partner,

22:47.867 --> 22:49.135
while I grab us
some cucumber water.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.040
Okay, dude.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.508
Dude, what the hell?

22:55.542 --> 22:57.043
This is weird, dude.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.845
No, no, no, wait, we left weird
back at his apartment.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.781
This is way past weird.

23:01.814 --> 23:02.949
I know, but what
am I supposed to do?

23:02.982 --> 23:05.084
Get rid of your
crazy father-in-law.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.619
Look, obviously
I don't want Rogelio here.

23:06.653 --> 23:07.920
I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.427
Rogelio, I'm sorry.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.163
No-no apology necessary.

23:17.196 --> 23:21.000
I will take my leave
so you can start having fun.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.543
Hey, Rogelio, I am so sorry.
I feel terrible.

23:30.577 --> 23:31.878
If you didn't want me
at your party,

23:31.911 --> 23:33.646
then why did you invite me?

23:36.783 --> 23:38.585
I never meant to.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.622
When you found about it
and-and wanted to come,

23:42.655 --> 23:44.056
I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.958
And then you ran with it,
making this whole night.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.226
Your friends weren't
making any plans.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.695
I wanted it to be special.

23:48.728 --> 23:49.896
I know.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.464
I thought you like
being pampered.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.865
Men these days.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.101
They don't take enough time
for themselves.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.504
It's not about the spa.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.806
Having you here, it changes

23:59.839 --> 24:01.574
the dynamic with my friends.

24:01.608 --> 24:02.975
But we're friends!

24:03.009 --> 24:04.944
#Brogelios4Life.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.879
We are, but we're also
about to be family,

24:06.913 --> 24:08.881
and you know,
that changes things.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.017
They can't tell funny stories
and have them be inappropriate

24:11.050 --> 24:13.185
while my wife's dad
is around, you know?

24:13.219 --> 24:15.655
Yeah, I understand.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.190
If I were a normal dad.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.792
But I'm a cool dad.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.194
You can be inappropriate
around me, I swear.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.497
(sighs)

24:24.531 --> 24:26.633
Okay, we-- I mean, all right.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.668
You know that story
with the Redneck Riviera?

24:28.701 --> 24:29.902
When you ate the worm?
Hilarious.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.771
Yeah, and after that,

24:31.804 --> 24:35.074
we went to a strip club
where we met

24:35.107 --> 24:37.510
a stripper named Jane
and her twin sister,

24:37.544 --> 24:39.278
and she showed us...
Enough, stop it!

24:39.311 --> 24:40.513
I'm sorry.
I get it.

24:40.547 --> 24:41.648
I get it.

24:41.681 --> 24:42.749
You've made your point.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.283
I'll cancel the massages

24:44.316 --> 24:46.218
so you can go to a bar
with your friends

24:46.252 --> 24:49.221
and talk about things I never
want to hear about again.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.691
Okay, let's get
out of the pool...

24:51.724 --> 24:53.159
Wait, wait, wait,
I-I mean,

24:53.192 --> 24:56.896
I'm not really in a bar mood
right now-- are you?

24:56.929 --> 24:59.231
I mean, we go to bars,
like, every night.

24:59.265 --> 25:02.702
Yeah, and a two-hour massage,
bro, sounds kind of cool.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.236
Fine, yeah, yeah.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.873
We'll, uh, we'll
get the massages.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.775
VALERIA:
 Relax.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.009
We got this.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.243
Okay, repeat the plan

25:11.277 --> 25:12.545
back to me just to make sure.

25:12.579 --> 25:13.580
You go.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.247
I thought you were listening.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.683
I listened last time.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.184
Okay, both of you, listen!

25:18.217 --> 25:19.819
One of you says you have
a personal emergency

25:19.852 --> 25:21.053
and you need to borrow
Professor Blake's phone

25:21.087 --> 25:22.154
because both of your phones

25:22.188 --> 25:23.255
are dead, then

25:23.289 --> 25:24.691
one of you stays with him

25:24.724 --> 25:26.025
while the other one goes
to make the call

25:26.058 --> 25:28.127
and deletes the voice mail,
then you return

25:28.160 --> 25:29.962
the phone to Professor Blake
and you slip out.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.565
One champagne.
No champagne!

25:32.599 --> 25:34.333
Calm down, calm down, we
got this. This is easy.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.003
Yeah, it's like taking candy
from a baby.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.140
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Or leaving your babies.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.975
Honestly, I don't know
 what's more shocking.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.044
Petra abandoning her children

25:45.077 --> 25:48.314
or Petra taking a bus.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.916
(moaning)

25:49.949 --> 25:51.818
Can't believe how
much I like this.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.686
You-you never had a massage?

25:53.720 --> 25:56.022
No.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.725
Well, they are

25:58.758 --> 26:00.727
very relaxing.

26:08.701 --> 26:09.869
So, Ro?

26:09.902 --> 26:11.671
Is everything cool with us?

26:11.704 --> 26:13.840
Yes, I understand
what you're saying.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.241
There should be a certain amount

26:15.274 --> 26:18.210
of decorum between father-in-law
and son-in-law.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.880
I don't need to hear everything.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.882
Okay, but the thing is,

26:22.915 --> 26:26.018
you did hear about
the strippers or whatever.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.254
Does that change
the way you feel about me?

26:28.287 --> 26:29.288
What?

26:29.321 --> 26:30.690
Of course not.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.692
(sighs)
Okay, good.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.727
I was worried.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.930
You were?

26:38.998 --> 26:41.267
Of course.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.002
What you think
really matters to me.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.771
More than anything.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.906
I mean...
(chuckles)

26:46.939 --> 26:48.775
I'm marrying your daughter.

26:48.808 --> 26:52.278
You're massaging my heart
right now, Michael Cordero.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.113
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Aw!

26:54.146 --> 26:55.314
Looks like this massage

26:55.347 --> 26:57.784
has a happy ending after all!

26:57.817 --> 27:01.053
(both imitate small explosion)

27:01.087 --> 27:02.655
And just for the record,

27:02.689 --> 27:05.191
I couldn't imagine
anyone better for Jane.

27:05.224 --> 27:06.659
Oh...

27:06.693 --> 27:08.695
You are my dream man.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.830
JANE:
 This is a nightmare.

27:10.863 --> 27:13.132
Here, this will take
the edge off waiting.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.200
I can't believe
this is happening!

27:14.233 --> 27:15.702
We got it!
Huh?

27:15.735 --> 27:17.870
Piece of cake!
You took it?

27:17.904 --> 27:19.005
We figured we'd
let you do the honors.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.272
Fine, give me that.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.975
Oh, yes, it doesn't
require a code.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.711
Sucker.
Ooh!

27:24.744 --> 27:26.045
(gasps)
Found my voice mail.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.179
He didn't listen!
 Yes!

27:29.015 --> 27:30.382
(gasps)
What is that?

27:30.416 --> 27:31.984
His wallet.
What?!

27:32.018 --> 27:34.153
(phone beeping)
What is it doing?

27:34.186 --> 27:35.722
Oh, he has Find My Phone!

27:35.755 --> 27:36.989
What?!
Ditch it, quick!

27:37.023 --> 27:39.425
(grunts)
No!

27:40.793 --> 27:42.995
Now!
Aah! Gah!

27:43.029 --> 27:44.030
No!
For our blog!

27:44.063 --> 27:45.732
Leave it.
(both grunt)

27:45.765 --> 27:46.833
Run! Run!

27:56.809 --> 27:59.011
We really did it!
I can't believe we did it!

27:59.045 --> 28:00.146
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Me neither.
Now let's get back to partying!

28:00.179 --> 28:01.748
Wait, where's my mom?

28:01.781 --> 28:04.817
She went back to get the phones.
What phones?

28:04.851 --> 28:07.253
I guess she left her purse
with our phones in the bar?

28:07.286 --> 28:09.088
What?
Except yours!

28:09.121 --> 28:10.890
So we got her
an Uber and she's on it.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.493
(sighs)

28:14.526 --> 28:16.195
Chad's on the lookout.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.797
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And that's when...

28:17.830 --> 28:18.998
Your fiancé.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.200
...she saw him.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.402
And he saw her.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.437
Oh...

28:27.006 --> 28:28.240
Did you hear back from your mom?

28:28.274 --> 28:29.441
No, not yet.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.778
God, your skin looks amazing.

28:31.811 --> 28:32.879
Spasibo.
(laughs)

28:32.912 --> 28:34.113
That's thank you
in Russian.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.481
Fancy.
I know.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.349
(phone chimes)
Oh, please, please, please.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.786
Finally.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.823
Ah...
I got this.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.996
Don't worry,
I'm in charge of your mom.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.130
Really?

28:51.163 --> 28:52.865
Really.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.333
LINA:
Good news,

28:54.366 --> 28:56.002
bachelors and bachelorettes,

28:56.035 --> 28:58.971
everyone is down for
an after-party at the Marbella.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.840
Should we do it?

29:00.873 --> 29:01.908
I don't know.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.812
Do you want to?

29:05.845 --> 29:07.213
I wouldn't mind a drink.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.820
Last night of freedom, right?

29:13.853 --> 29:14.821
Let's do it.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.489
* Hey, hey, hey, hey

29:17.523 --> 29:21.360
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And do it, they did!

29:21.393 --> 29:24.496
* 'Cause we comin'
out tonight... *

29:24.530 --> 29:26.799
* Hey, hey, hip-hop hooray...

29:26.833 --> 29:28.067
I am on it, I am

29:28.100 --> 29:29.068
(high voice):
on it!
Yeah!

29:29.101 --> 29:30.502
(laughs)
(whoops)

29:30.536 --> 29:32.071
* 'Cause we comin'
out tonight... *

29:32.104 --> 29:33.372
Hey.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.541
I might have not
gone to college,

29:35.574 --> 29:39.078
but at least
I can dance, okay?

29:39.111 --> 29:40.980
Why are you being so mean?

29:41.013 --> 29:43.850
Oh, my God, Angela's been
so rude to me all night!

29:43.883 --> 29:46.085
What are you talking about?
Yeah, yeah.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.387
Asking questions...
That's Angela!

29:48.420 --> 29:50.089
That's why we call
her Weird Angela.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.390
I thought you said
she was brilliant.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.525
She is, and weird.
Angela?

29:53.559 --> 29:55.061
No! No!
Yes!

29:56.996 --> 29:59.798
Angela, Lina would like
to apologize to you.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.402
I'm sorry if I was
rude to you tonight.

30:03.435 --> 30:04.904
When were you rude?

30:06.138 --> 30:08.274
(mouths)
Who's thirsty?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.876
Should I? I'm pretty wasted.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.043
I just texted your mom.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.111
She's pulling into the hotel.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.412
Do it.

30:13.445 --> 30:14.981
* Hey, hey, hip-hop hooray

30:15.014 --> 30:16.548
* Pop a bottle
and flow all day... *

30:16.582 --> 30:18.117
Ah! (whoops)

30:18.150 --> 30:20.019
* Pop a bottle
and flow all day *

30:20.052 --> 30:22.989
* 'Cause we comin'
out tonight... *

30:23.022 --> 30:24.556
It is going down!

30:24.590 --> 30:26.258
Yeah?

30:26.292 --> 30:27.526
Yeah!
(whoops)

30:27.559 --> 30:29.261
(chimes tinkle)

30:29.295 --> 30:31.563
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor

30:31.597 --> 30:33.565
and privilege
to welcome to the stage

30:33.599 --> 30:36.535
the Queen of Miami,
the Boss of the Beach,

30:36.568 --> 30:39.939
the Maiden of the Marbella...

30:39.972 --> 30:43.442
it's Sweet Lady Jane!

30:43.475 --> 30:45.077
(cheering)

30:45.111 --> 30:47.213
*

30:47.246 --> 30:49.181
* First things first,
I'm Sweet Lady Jane *

30:49.215 --> 30:51.317
* And I'm-a drop lyrics
so sick, they insane *

30:51.350 --> 30:53.485
* Got the 305 and
I'm bringing the pain *

30:53.519 --> 30:55.487
* Got the fly boys screamin'
"That's Sweet Lady Jane" *

30:55.521 --> 30:58.224
* Got a secret for y'all:
it's my last night of freedom *

30:58.257 --> 31:00.226
* I'm like Don Quixote
and I'm finding my kingdom *

31:00.259 --> 31:02.228
* Got my king by my side 'cause
this queen likes to ride *

31:02.261 --> 31:05.064
* Far away from the baby mama
drama drama drama drama... *

31:05.097 --> 31:07.599
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 At least, that's what happened
 in her head.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.502
In reality...
 Jane was really wasted.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.371
So it was more like this.

31:12.404 --> 31:13.405
Yeah!
Yeah!

31:13.439 --> 31:15.307
Yeah!
ALL:
Yeah!

31:15.341 --> 31:16.475
* Y'all say...
 The point was,

31:16.508 --> 31:18.144
she lost control.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.913
* I love you
like you love me... *

31:20.947 --> 31:22.949
* Yo. Yo.
(beatboxing)

31:22.982 --> 31:24.216
* It's gotta be great

31:24.250 --> 31:25.584
* I cannot wait

31:25.617 --> 31:27.686
* I wanna rock, I wanna roll

31:27.719 --> 31:30.022
* I wanna be so gangster

31:30.056 --> 31:32.624
* I'm gonna go slow,
real slow... *

31:36.362 --> 31:38.230
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, dear.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.967
Someone seems to be
 having regrets.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.404
Wait a second.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.939
I wasn't awful.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.174
So awful.

31:48.207 --> 31:49.408
(laughing):
Oh, no!

31:49.441 --> 31:50.509
Lina, um, a-as your
friend, I feel like

31:50.542 --> 31:52.278
it's my duty
to let you know

31:52.311 --> 31:54.113
that guy Chad, who you like,
he's out in the hall, and...

31:54.146 --> 31:56.115
Oh!

31:58.484 --> 32:00.386
Oh, my God. You have
got to be kidding me.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.255
Mom?

32:04.156 --> 32:05.291
(exhales)
Uh...

32:05.324 --> 32:06.325
CHAD:
Wait, Lina, wait.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.528
Jane, I'm sorry.

32:09.561 --> 32:11.964
This is why I didn't want you
at my bachelorette party.

32:11.998 --> 32:13.465
Because I knew
this would happen.

32:13.499 --> 32:16.102
I knew you would act
like a drunk sorority girl.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.503
Wait. That's not fair.

32:17.536 --> 32:18.670
You're right.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.140
(crying):
It's not fair!

32:21.173 --> 32:23.475
You know why I'm such
a control freak, Mom?

32:23.509 --> 32:25.011
Because I grew up with you,

32:25.044 --> 32:27.313
and you are so out of control!

32:39.125 --> 32:41.493
Hey.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.229
I am so sorry.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.364
No.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.366
He was clearly a jerk.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.600
It's better I know now.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.336
Are you okay?

32:50.369 --> 32:52.504
I think this...

32:52.538 --> 32:54.773
and the Angela thing...

32:54.806 --> 32:56.642
It's like,
you're getting married,

32:56.675 --> 32:58.177
you have a kid,

32:58.210 --> 33:00.512
and I'm happy for you, I am.

33:00.546 --> 33:01.580
I know.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.115
But it just makes me think

33:03.149 --> 33:04.616
how everything is
moving forward for you,

33:04.650 --> 33:07.386
but I'm still sort of lost.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.190
I don't want to be
at the Marbella forever.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.324
And you won't be.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.325
Yeah.

33:13.359 --> 33:14.660
(sniffs)

33:14.693 --> 33:16.162
Do you want to make a list?

33:17.463 --> 33:18.797
What kind of list?

33:18.830 --> 33:21.133
Well, just like
a five-point action item list.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.435
Don't worry, it's, like,
the most basic type of list.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.037
Oh, my God,

33:25.071 --> 33:26.538
you have different
types of lists?
Of course.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.040
(laughs)
Hey, if you want
to be a stylist,

33:28.074 --> 33:29.675
you gotta come up
with a plan, right?

33:29.708 --> 33:31.743
Okay. Let's do it.

33:31.777 --> 33:35.414
And my mom owes you
an apology, of course.

33:35.447 --> 33:38.217
No. It's like
she helped me, kind of.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.452
Seeing that... you know?
I don't know.

33:40.486 --> 33:43.155
It's like a cautionary tale,

33:43.189 --> 33:45.191
right?

33:47.326 --> 33:49.095
(door opens)

33:49.128 --> 33:50.329
Mmm...

33:53.732 --> 33:55.134
I know.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.209
Oh...

34:05.744 --> 34:07.079
(sighs)

34:07.113 --> 34:10.482
I messed up, Ma.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.518
I really messed up.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.248
No...

34:42.281 --> 34:43.449
What the hell?

34:43.482 --> 34:45.684
Oh, we all got them. Bam!

34:45.717 --> 34:47.353
Oh, no!

34:47.386 --> 34:48.554
Yep.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.289
Oh, my God...

34:50.322 --> 34:52.324
Yeah.
(giggles)

34:53.559 --> 34:54.726
Oh, I'm still drunk.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.694
I know.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.229
(giggles)

34:57.263 --> 34:59.865
But can I say something?

35:01.267 --> 35:05.804
I love you so much.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.439
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 So, I guess we're back
 to gushing levels.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.475
And I'm not just gushing
because I'm drunk,

35:09.508 --> 35:11.777
I'm gushing

35:11.810 --> 35:14.646
because...

35:14.680 --> 35:17.383
I've been having trouble
with my vows.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.618
Distilling
what to say.

35:19.651 --> 35:22.421
And tonight I realized

35:22.454 --> 35:24.156
it's simple.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.626
With you...

35:27.659 --> 35:31.163
You make me feel safe,

35:31.197 --> 35:32.864
in the best way.

35:34.833 --> 35:38.537
And my mom kept telling me
to lose control,

35:38.570 --> 35:43.409
but I couldn't
until you got here.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.577
Because I know
you're watching over me.

35:45.611 --> 35:46.812
(sobs)

35:46.845 --> 35:48.180
Instead of me always having

35:48.214 --> 35:49.448
to watch over everyone else.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.183
So tonight is not

35:51.217 --> 35:52.584
my last night of freedom,

35:52.618 --> 35:55.487
it's my first night of freedom.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.927
And that's what I'm going
to put in my vows.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.696
Minus the whole
"mom out of control" part.

36:04.730 --> 36:08.400
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.802
I've been feeling
a little stuck, and I,

36:10.836 --> 36:11.937
and I figured out why--

36:11.970 --> 36:14.473
during my massage.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.474
(laughs)

36:15.507 --> 36:17.476
I realized that
some things

36:17.509 --> 36:19.478
are only meant for
certain people to hear.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.613
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Redneck Riviera, for example--

36:21.647 --> 36:23.649
not a story for fathers-in-law.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.917
And when it comes to
my feelings for you...

36:25.951 --> 36:29.421
you're the only person that
I want to share those with.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.557
So I was
wondering if...

36:31.590 --> 36:35.327
maybe we didn't put the
vows in the program...

36:35.361 --> 36:38.430
but instead I told
you them right now.

36:38.464 --> 36:39.665
(softly):
Yes.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.567
Yes, please.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.903
*

36:47.473 --> 36:48.574
Jane...

36:48.607 --> 36:49.741
(whispers):
Yeah?

36:49.775 --> 36:51.577
*

36:51.610 --> 36:54.880
Sorry, but remember,
 he wants these to be private.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.483
You'll just have
 to take my word for it--

36:57.516 --> 36:59.485
they were perfect.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.820
*

37:09.895 --> 37:12.564
Thank you.
And I am so sorry again

37:12.598 --> 37:14.866
for waking them up
when I got in last night.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.436
(sighs)

37:17.469 --> 37:19.471
(phone chimes)

37:26.612 --> 37:27.979
Huh.

37:28.013 --> 37:30.316
I-I get a warrant, he knows
you told me about it.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.417
So don't get a warrant.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.653
Oh, come on, Michael.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.656
We both know you're not
above bending the rules.

37:37.689 --> 37:38.790
Those days are over.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.892
It's all got to be
by the book now.

37:40.926 --> 37:44.930
So apparently, Rafael took
 matters into his own hands,

37:44.963 --> 37:48.534
and he got proof that his
 brother was telling the truth.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.968
Thanks for letting me crash.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.871
You okay?
Yeah.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.340
Yeah.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.807
For the first time,
 he trusts you.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.676
Sorry, I'm just...
Are you hungry?

37:57.709 --> 37:59.511
Yeah.
Here, let's get
some food, huh?

37:59.545 --> 38:00.912
I'll pull up a menu.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.614
What's that e-mail?

38:02.648 --> 38:03.915
From the bank?

38:05.651 --> 38:07.519
Oh, my God.
What?

38:07.553 --> 38:10.021
Did I buy stock last night?

38:10.055 --> 38:11.357
I don't know, man.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.959
It's all kind of a blur.
(chuckles): Yeah.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.827
Oh, my God, I did.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.329
And I just...

38:17.363 --> 38:19.097
made $5 million.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.633
Okay. Wow.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.836
Uh... so we should probably get
our stories straight, right?

38:24.870 --> 38:26.104
What do you mean?

38:26.137 --> 38:28.840
Well, Brandon knew
they had the patent...

38:28.874 --> 38:30.976
before they announced
it this morning.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.579
You mean like...
 insider trading?

38:33.612 --> 38:35.647
I'm sorry, I...
I thought you knew.

38:35.681 --> 38:38.350
That's why...
I didn't want you to invest.

38:39.385 --> 38:42.020
What a mess.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.923
And from one mess to another.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.825
(knocking)

38:50.762 --> 38:53.732
Hey. Pastelitos.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.401
Ah, yes.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.503
An old family tradition.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.538
(knocking)

39:00.539 --> 39:02.741
Pastelitos from Isidoro's.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.643
*

39:05.644 --> 39:08.079
I'm sorry about last night.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.582
I-I was out of control.

39:10.616 --> 39:13.118
It's just that
you're turning 21.

39:13.151 --> 39:15.153
And you're getting married.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.855
(crying):
You're an adult now.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.757
And what that does to me...

39:18.790 --> 39:21.092
What that does to me-- well,

39:21.126 --> 39:24.663
it makes me feel old, for one.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.798
And it makes me realize...

39:26.832 --> 39:28.867
that my big job is done.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.101
Being a mom,

39:30.135 --> 39:31.937
it's the only thing

39:31.970 --> 39:33.972
I've been really successful at.

39:34.005 --> 39:37.776
(sobbing):
And it makes me wonder...

39:37.809 --> 39:39.978
what am I doing with my life?

39:40.011 --> 39:42.047
*

39:42.080 --> 39:44.416
(crying): A-And I just
realized that I...

39:44.450 --> 39:47.118
(chuckles) have
to figure it out, you know?

39:48.720 --> 39:49.821
So I will.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.189
And I'm sorry.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.991
It's okay, Mom.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.626
I know it's hard.

39:54.660 --> 39:55.994
And I'm sorry.

39:56.027 --> 39:58.029
And maybe
 it was Jane's hangover

39:58.063 --> 40:00.198
or the fact that
 it was the same apology

40:00.231 --> 40:03.935
Xo had given four years before
 and four years before that,

40:03.969 --> 40:05.937
but this time Jane said...

40:05.971 --> 40:07.973
I don't want your apology, Mom.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.975
I want you to grow up.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.511
What are you talking about?
I'm plenty grown up.

40:12.544 --> 40:15.647
We've been having
the same conversation for years.

40:15.681 --> 40:17.783
At this point,
 I should remind you

40:17.816 --> 40:19.918
that Jane didn't lose control
 very often.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.119
And I've had it.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.954
Enough with all
the excuses

40:22.988 --> 40:24.756
and the apologies.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.091
At this point

40:26.124 --> 40:27.893
you are just a cautionary tale.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.896
But when she did, it was epic.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.602
(taking deep breaths)

40:38.670 --> 40:40.739
*

40:43.975 --> 40:46.645
Which brings us back to Petra.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.847
*

40:48.880 --> 40:51.517
It should be noted
 that Petra, too,

40:51.550 --> 40:54.219
rarely lost control.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.560
Oh, my God.

41:01.593 --> 41:04.162
My long-lost sister!
It's you!

41:04.195 --> 41:06.231
(laughs):
It's really you!

41:06.264 --> 41:08.033
Oh!

41:08.066 --> 41:10.001
Then again,

41:10.035 --> 41:12.738
that isn't Petra.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.740
