This week on "VICE":

00:09.329 --> 00:12.530
The effects of America's
growing heroin epidemic.

00:12.632 --> 00:15.767
Woman: <i> Unfortunately, with this
epidemic you have to throw out</i>

00:15.869 --> 00:19.937
what you thought addiction was,
what you thought an addict was.

00:25.879 --> 00:29.180
And then the next nuclear arms race.

00:29.282 --> 00:31.916
Man:
<i>Dive! Dive! Dive!</i>

00:32.018 --> 00:35.987
It's a pretty surreal feeling to come
up on a ballistic missile submarine.

00:36.089 --> 00:37.922
It looks like a giant steel whale.

00:38.024 --> 00:41.225
Man: <i>We are restarting
a nuclear arms race,</i>

00:41.327 --> 00:44.061
and our public is
blissfully unaware of that.

00:56.910 --> 00:59.677
Crowd: Hands up!
Don't shoot! Hands up!

01:07.687 --> 01:09.387
Today the United States is
in the middle

01:09.489 --> 01:11.689
of the worst drug crisis
in our history.

01:11.791 --> 01:14.625
<i>Overdoses and deaths
are at an all-time high.</i>

01:14.727 --> 01:19.363
<i>Now, this epidemic involves scores of
new and powerful pharmaceutical drugs,</i>

01:19.465 --> 01:23.801
but at the center of it is
one of the oldest: Heroin.

01:38.518 --> 01:41.152
Morning. We're
in Guerrero, Mexico...

01:43.423 --> 01:46.157
at the source
of America's heroin problem.

01:52.198 --> 01:53.664
Ah...

01:53.766 --> 01:56.267
There they are.

01:56.369 --> 01:59.770
So, all these little flowers in
here will be harvested for opium,

01:59.873 --> 02:01.873
which will then be turned into heroin

02:01.975 --> 02:04.242
and shipped up north.

02:04.344 --> 02:07.278
But right now,
they're just pretty flowers.

02:41.247 --> 02:42.747
These are the scorers.

02:42.849 --> 02:45.049
So you cut the pod?

02:45.151 --> 02:46.317
<i>Sí.</i>

02:47.720 --> 02:48.786
<i>Sí.</i>

02:52.992 --> 02:54.558
Well, what do you do now?

03:13.846 --> 03:15.546
Who buys it?
Who's the buyer?

03:21.921 --> 03:24.422
Forty-three is responding.

03:28.394 --> 03:29.860
Upstairs to the right.

03:33.166 --> 03:36.100
Sweetheart, let me get in there
and check a pulse. Okay?

03:36.202 --> 03:37.702
When did you find him?

03:39.038 --> 03:40.237
Okay, he took a breath.

03:40.340 --> 03:42.406
Go ahead and get the Ambu bag out.

03:42.508 --> 03:44.809
Okay, drag
him out in the hallway.

03:44.911 --> 03:45.943
Okay.

03:47.847 --> 03:49.280
Is he a known addict?

03:51.718 --> 03:54.552
Okay. Can you get some Narcan?

03:54.654 --> 03:56.721
I can get him nasally real quick.

04:07.233 --> 04:10.067
Mickey? Hey, Buddy!

04:11.871 --> 04:13.838
He's coming back.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.039
Mickey?

04:21.680 --> 04:24.582
We've had this gentleman multiple
times in the last couple weeks.

04:24.684 --> 04:27.985
He'll probably wake up en route
to the hospital completely.

04:28.087 --> 04:32.156
But it's very common
that we have repeat overdoses.

04:35.561 --> 04:37.828
Heroin is definitively
back in America.

04:37.930 --> 04:39.830
<i>Over the last decade,
the number of addicts</i>

04:39.932 --> 04:41.465
<i>nationwide has more than doubled,</i>

04:41.567 --> 04:43.367
<i>and the overdose rate
is four to five times</i>

04:43.469 --> 04:44.902
<i>what it was in the 1970s,</i>

04:45.004 --> 04:47.271
<i>which was basically
the heroin decade.</i>

04:47.373 --> 04:49.273
The epicenter
of this new wave of junkie-dom

04:49.375 --> 04:51.942
is not the urban centers
of New York or Baltimore.

04:52.045 --> 04:53.878
<i>It's in the hills of West Virginia,</i>

04:53.980 --> 04:55.980
<i>smack in the middle of Appalachia.</i>

04:56.082 --> 05:00.384
We are a microcosm of everything that
has happened across the country,

05:00.486 --> 05:02.787
but it's just so focused right here.

05:02.889 --> 05:05.322
We knew that we had
to step up our efforts

05:05.425 --> 05:07.058
from a law enforcement standpoint.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.326
What we're trying to do
is clean things up

05:09.429 --> 05:12.830
to get back to the glory
that we once knew.

05:12.932 --> 05:14.165
Morton:
<i>Right now, at least</i>

05:14.267 --> 05:15.966
<i>according to what
statistics are available,</i>

05:16.069 --> 05:18.169
<i>Huntington is the worst hit
city in the state.</i>

05:18.271 --> 05:19.904
<i>In order to fight the problem,
the mayor here</i>

05:20.006 --> 05:21.872
<i>has assembled an office
of drug control policy.</i>

05:21.974 --> 05:25.743
Essentially modeling it after
the country's drug czar,

05:25.845 --> 05:30.014
which is, you know, kind of a crazy thing
for a town of 50,000 people to need,

05:30.116 --> 05:33.551
<i>but in light of the fact they're
averaging three overdoses a day,</i>

05:33.653 --> 05:37.354
I guess you sort of have to find a way
to fight crazy with some form of crazy.

05:38.424 --> 05:40.558
<i>One of this town drug czar's
best resources</i>

05:40.660 --> 05:44.161
<i>is Scott Lemley, a young "Moneyball"
sort of kid from the police department,</i>

05:44.263 --> 05:46.764
<i>trying to use statistics
to get a grasp on the problem.</i>

05:46.866 --> 05:49.066
How do the numbers
here work? Like, what's...

05:49.168 --> 05:52.002
Basically, all the overdose
deaths we've had in the county,

05:52.105 --> 05:53.838
they've all been opiate related.

05:53.940 --> 05:56.040
<i>If you look at
the city of Huntington,</i>

05:56.142 --> 05:57.842
<i>we have a death rate,</i>

05:57.944 --> 05:59.777
<i>119 per 100,000.</i>

05:59.879 --> 06:01.946
<i>National average is 13.</i>

06:02.048 --> 06:05.516
So we're about 11 times
the national average.

06:05.618 --> 06:10.087
Do you have figures about the socioeconomic
background of the people who are dying?

06:10.189 --> 06:12.890
We've had overdoses in the best
neighborhoods in Huntington.

06:12.992 --> 06:15.292
<i>We've had overdoses in the worst.</i>

06:15.394 --> 06:19.063
<i>It's across the board, it really is.</i>

06:19.165 --> 06:20.631
Morton:
<i>Jan Rader, a trained nurse</i>

06:20.733 --> 06:22.733
<i>and deputy chief of the
Huntington fire department,</i>

06:22.835 --> 06:24.395
<i>as well as the woman
who we just watched</i>

06:24.437 --> 06:25.870
<i>save an overdose victim,</i>

06:25.972 --> 06:27.972
<i>is also part of the drug task force.</i>

06:28.074 --> 06:30.674
It's sad when you can
drive around the city

06:30.776 --> 06:35.913
and you remember places
by who overdosed and died.

06:37.583 --> 06:41.552
Unfortunately, with this epidemic,
you have to throw out, you know,

06:41.654 --> 06:43.521
what you thought addiction was,

06:43.623 --> 06:45.523
what you thought an addict was.

06:50.062 --> 06:55.266
You know, I don't think the medical
field realized what they were creating

06:55.368 --> 06:57.468
<i>when this wonderful pain medicine,</i>

06:57.570 --> 06:59.370
synthetic opiates, was invented.

06:59.472 --> 07:02.940
Morton: <i>What's crazy is, all this
new smack and pill addiction</i>

07:03.042 --> 07:07.845
<i>can essentially be traced to one specific
opiate and its maker: OxyContin,</i>

07:07.947 --> 07:12.049
<i>released to the public by
Purdue Pharmaceuticals in 1996.</i>

07:12.151 --> 07:14.952
OxyContin is extended
release oxycodone.

07:15.054 --> 07:17.688
That's a very good drug
to prescribe to someone

07:17.790 --> 07:21.192
<i>with cancer pain, at the end of life.</i>

07:21.294 --> 07:23.194
Morton: <i>Dr. Andrew Kolodny
has been studying</i>

07:23.296 --> 07:25.763
<i>the skyrocketing rates of heroin
addiction across the country</i>

07:25.865 --> 07:27.898
<i>from its beginning
in prescription pills.</i>

07:28.000 --> 07:29.567
The way you get a blockbuster drug

07:29.669 --> 07:33.871
is by getting doctors to prescribe
it for things like low back pain.

07:33.973 --> 07:37.274
<i>And if it's a drug that is
very difficult to stop taking,</i>

07:37.376 --> 07:39.243
then you've got the magic formula.

07:39.345 --> 07:41.745
Morton: <i>Purdue campaigned
heavily throughout the '90s</i>

07:41.847 --> 07:43.814
<i>to convince doctors
that not only was OxyContin</i>

07:43.916 --> 07:45.683
<i>safe to prescribe for chronic pain,</i>

07:45.785 --> 07:47.218
<i>but that opiates in general,</i>

07:47.320 --> 07:48.919
<i>the drug class
that includes OxyContin,</i>

07:49.021 --> 07:51.522
<i>as well as morphine, Dilaudid,
and heroin,</i>

07:51.624 --> 07:53.123
<i>were far less addictive</i>

07:53.226 --> 07:55.359
<i>than all previous medical
science had shown.</i>

07:55.461 --> 07:59.163
Now, in fact, the rate of addiction

07:59.265 --> 08:02.166
amongst pain patients
who are treated by doctors

08:02.268 --> 08:03.834
is much less than one percent.

08:03.936 --> 08:06.470
The statistic that was
used over and over again

08:06.572 --> 08:08.872
was much less than one percent
of patients would get addicted.

08:08.975 --> 08:12.543
<i>But what you would find is
that what everybody was citing</i>

08:12.645 --> 08:14.979
<i>wasn't actually a journal article.</i>

08:15.081 --> 08:18.015
<i>It was a one-paragraph
letter to the editor.</i>

08:18.117 --> 08:20.417
And yet, that's what
was used as evidence

08:20.519 --> 08:24.622
and cited hundreds of times
by experts in the field

08:24.724 --> 08:26.690
as proof that we shouldn't be worried

08:26.792 --> 08:28.525
about getting our patients addicted.

08:28.628 --> 08:30.394
<i>Something you have to understand</i>

08:30.496 --> 08:32.996
<i>is that when when we talk
about opioid pain medicine,</i>

08:33.099 --> 08:37.101
<i>we're essentially
talking about heroin pills.</i>

08:37.203 --> 08:40.638
From the beginning of
the opioid addiction epidemic,

08:40.740 --> 08:43.006
the young people
who were opioid-addicted

08:43.109 --> 08:46.176
who were having trouble getting
enough pills from doctors,

08:46.279 --> 08:47.845
would go to the black market,

08:47.947 --> 08:49.627
and if they were in
a region of the country

08:49.715 --> 08:51.982
where heroin was available,
they switched.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.054
Morton: Can I ask you
how you started using?

09:02.995 --> 09:05.663
Had you ever touched
heroin before that or...?

09:05.765 --> 09:07.064
Why'd you switch?

09:08.934 --> 09:10.167
Ah.

09:29.055 --> 09:31.588
Morton: <i>What's particularly
insidious about opiate addiction</i>

09:31.691 --> 09:33.824
<i>is how quickly the body
develops a tolerance,</i>

09:33.926 --> 09:37.494
<i>requiring increasing amounts of the
drug just to generate the same effect,</i>

09:37.596 --> 09:40.831
<i>which, obviously, also increases
the chance of accidental overdose.</i>

09:40.933 --> 09:42.633
Morton: You're making
these big lines.

09:42.735 --> 09:46.270
If you had just started,
like, how big a...

09:46.372 --> 09:47.972
how big of a bump
are you doing? Okay.

10:06.625 --> 10:09.226
Morton: <i>While pill makers like
Purdue teed up all this madness,</i>

10:09.328 --> 10:11.829
<i>at the very least,
their product was regulated.</i>

10:11.931 --> 10:13.764
<i>If you took an 80mg OxyContin,</i>

10:13.866 --> 10:16.033
<i>you knew exactly how much oxy
you were taking.</i>

10:16.135 --> 10:17.334
<i>This is not the case with heroin,</i>

10:17.436 --> 10:19.169
<i>whose strength can vary
from batch to batch,</i>

10:19.271 --> 10:20.704
<i>and even bag to bag.</i>

10:20.806 --> 10:22.673
<i>On top of that, heroin has to be cut,</i>

10:22.775 --> 10:25.409
<i>because pure heroin alone would
kill even a veteran junkie.</i>

10:25.511 --> 10:28.312
<i>But what it's cut with
is anybody's guess.</i>

10:35.321 --> 10:36.353
Yeah.

10:41.660 --> 10:44.194
And how much could you
sell it for if you cut it?

10:50.035 --> 10:52.770
Are those... What are those?
Are those movie tickets?

10:52.872 --> 10:54.438
Oh, lottery tickets.

11:03.182 --> 11:04.815
So, what do you cut it with?
Is that...

11:06.952 --> 11:08.519
No. Okay.

11:12.124 --> 11:13.190
Mm-hmm.

11:14.827 --> 11:17.227
When you say pills,
do you use painkiller pills?

11:21.934 --> 11:24.535
Well, it's basically the same
thing as heroin, isn't it? Right.

11:24.637 --> 11:26.937
Morton: <i>The strongest cutting
agent of all is fentanyl,</i>

11:27.039 --> 11:29.773
<i>which is the strongest opioid
painkiller in existence,</i>

11:29.875 --> 11:32.643
<i>up to 50 times
the strength of pure heroin.</i>

11:33.679 --> 11:35.359
Do you know anybody
who cuts with fentanyl?

11:42.121 --> 11:43.187
Yeah?

11:50.396 --> 11:51.428
Really?

11:52.731 --> 11:54.898
They were intentionally trying
to get someone to overdose.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.033
Yes.
Okay.

11:56.135 --> 11:58.001
Morton: <i>Accidental
overdoses have long served</i>

11:58.103 --> 12:00.737
<i>as a perverse form of
advertising for heroin dealers.</i>

12:00.840 --> 12:03.774
<i>But the fact that they're using
pharmaceutical drugs to induce them</i>

12:03.876 --> 12:07.211
<i>shows just how extreme
the demand has grown.</i>

12:07.313 --> 12:10.614
<i>So now the heroin epidemic that
the OxyContin epidemic started,</i>

12:10.716 --> 12:14.117
<i>has itself turned into
a fentanyl epidemic.</i>

12:14.220 --> 12:16.487
They didn't understand why they're
cutting heroin with fentanyl,

12:16.589 --> 12:18.222
because fentanyl is really expensive.

12:18.324 --> 12:19.523
And I kind of have this idea

12:19.625 --> 12:21.091
that they're not cutting
heroin with fentanyl.

12:21.193 --> 12:22.793
They're cutting
the fentanyl with heroin.

12:22.895 --> 12:26.129
Morton: <i>With an increasingly
toxic, and seemingly inexhaustible</i>

12:26.232 --> 12:28.232
<i>supply of heroin
entering the country,</i>

12:28.334 --> 12:30.334
<i>the government has finally
started making overtures</i>

12:30.436 --> 12:33.670
<i>towards addressing the problem
on the demand side.</i>

12:33.772 --> 12:39.142
More Americans now die
every year from drug overdoses

12:39.245 --> 12:43.113
than they do from
motor vehicle crashes.

12:43.215 --> 12:45.255
Morton: <i>President Obama has
come to Charleston today</i>

12:45.351 --> 12:46.551
<i>to address the heroin problem.</i>

12:46.652 --> 12:48.252
But there's
an ironic note in the fact

12:48.354 --> 12:50.687
that this is a crisis
that started in 2007,

12:50.789 --> 12:52.356
before the Obama presidency,

12:52.458 --> 12:55.058
<i>and it's taken till the second-to-last
year of his administration</i>

12:55.160 --> 12:57.294
<i>to address a problem
that's been in plain sight</i>

12:57.396 --> 13:00.330
<i>down here for over eight years.</i>

13:00.432 --> 13:02.592
Obama: I've made this a
priority for my administration.

13:02.635 --> 13:04.835
With no other disease
do we expect people to wait

13:04.937 --> 13:06.670
until they're a danger to themselves

13:06.772 --> 13:08.906
to self-diagnose
and seek treatment.

13:09.008 --> 13:10.741
You understand that
here in West Virginia.

13:10.843 --> 13:14.945
We want to make sure the whole country
understands how urgent this problem is.

13:22.788 --> 13:25.889
One big part of the problem with
the opiate crisis in West Virginia

13:25.991 --> 13:29.560
is they've... this is basically
their first time dealing with it.

13:29.662 --> 13:32.062
<i>This is actually a big part
of a larger problem</i>

13:32.164 --> 13:34.565
<i>with America's response
to drug problems.</i>

13:34.667 --> 13:36.633
<i>It's just general inexperience
with addiction,</i>

13:36.735 --> 13:39.903
like what it means to be an addict,
why people behave the way they do

13:40.005 --> 13:43.941
<i>when they're hooked on heroin
or OxyContin or other opioids.</i>

13:45.511 --> 13:48.151
Mickey, the addict who overdosed at
the very beginning of our piece,

13:48.180 --> 13:49.680
he survived, thankfully,

13:49.782 --> 13:51.381
<i>and was lucky to find a bed</i>

13:51.483 --> 13:53.317
<i>at a treatment facility
here in Huntington.</i>

13:54.787 --> 13:56.620
What's up?
What's going on, bro?

13:58.591 --> 14:01.091
Morton: <i> Now, you've been here before,
though, right? You were telling me.</i>

14:01.193 --> 14:02.492
Mickey: <i>Yeah, the first
time I was in here,</i>

14:02.595 --> 14:04.995
I just wanted that
damn judge off my back.

14:05.097 --> 14:07.864
The second time I came in, I just...

14:07.967 --> 14:09.399
needed to learn how to manage,

14:09.501 --> 14:11.835
to get back to where I was
able to use and still work,

14:11.937 --> 14:13.303
and pay bills and all that shit.

14:13.405 --> 14:15.005
Yeah. And, yeah, it
don't work that way.

14:15.107 --> 14:17.474
That's like trying to be, like, a
social drinker for alcoholics.

14:17.576 --> 14:20.077
Yeah. I was trying...
Yeah, I failed miserably.

14:20.179 --> 14:21.545
That's when I met you guys.

14:22.881 --> 14:25.115
Morton: <i>How many times had
you overdosed before that?</i>

14:25.217 --> 14:26.283
Mickey:
<i>About seven.</i>

14:26.385 --> 14:27.818
<i>I mean, I've overdosed
a bunch more than that,</i>

14:27.920 --> 14:29.786
<i>but seven of them, I had
to go to the hospital for.</i>

14:29.888 --> 14:30.988
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

14:31.090 --> 14:32.823
I woke up with everything
from hoses down my throat,

14:32.925 --> 14:35.125
to adrenaline shots, to Narcan.

14:35.227 --> 14:38.128
All:
God, grant us the serenity

14:38.230 --> 14:40.797
to accept the things
we cannot change...

14:40.899 --> 14:43.400
Hell, I've lived on the
streets, riverbanks, and tents,

14:43.502 --> 14:44.901
spent winters out there.

14:45.004 --> 14:47.604
<i>I mean, it's... You would
think it'd be enough</i>

14:47.706 --> 14:50.474
<i>just to make a person
want to stop and change,</i>

14:50.576 --> 14:52.876
but, fuck, it didn't stop me.

14:54.580 --> 14:57.981
Most people come in here to get a
life that they've had prior to here.

14:58.083 --> 15:01.752
I never had one. It's like
learning to walk again.

15:01.854 --> 15:04.921
I mean, if this was easy,
everybody would do it and quit.

15:05.024 --> 15:07.424
Right. Right. Drug dealers
would be out of business.

15:08.627 --> 15:11.428
It ain't that easy.

15:11.530 --> 15:13.897
There are some alarming
new numbers out from the CDC

15:13.999 --> 15:17.034
showing a dramatic rise in the
heroin epidemic in this country.

15:17.136 --> 15:19.736
Anchorman: <i>Today the state of
Washington set a new record.</i>

15:19.838 --> 15:21.238
<i>For the fifth year in a row</i>

15:21.340 --> 15:23.073
<i>the number of heroin
overdoses went up.</i>

15:23.175 --> 15:25.876
Overdose deaths
skyrocketed in Ohio last year.

15:25.978 --> 15:28.412
Kolodny: <i>This is a problem
we're going to be dealing with</i>

15:28.514 --> 15:30.113
<i>for the rest of our lives.</i>

15:30.215 --> 15:33.316
What you're hearing is,
we cracked down on painkillers

15:33.419 --> 15:36.787
<i>and everybody
switched over to heroin.</i>

15:36.889 --> 15:39.723
There hasn't been
a crackdown on painkillers.

15:39.825 --> 15:44.728
There's still massive
over-prescribing of opioids.

15:44.830 --> 15:47.931
<i>Every state in the country
has within it counties</i>

15:48.033 --> 15:51.968
<i>that are feeling
the effects of this epidemic.</i>

15:52.071 --> 15:57.307
This is the worst drug addiction
epidemic in United States history.

15:59.411 --> 16:01.344
Decades after the end
of the Cold War,

16:01.447 --> 16:06.083
America's now rebuilding
our aging nuclear arsenal.

16:06.185 --> 16:09.720
<i>Now, the Pentagon wants to spend
hundreds of billions of dollars</i>

16:09.822 --> 16:12.956
<i>on new warheads and new
vehicles to carry them.</i>

16:13.058 --> 16:15.358
<i>But this effort isn't just expensive,</i>

16:15.461 --> 16:18.528
it could actually be a threat
to our global security.

16:34.346 --> 16:36.546
Man: As you can see, it's kind of
tradition for a lot of people,

16:36.648 --> 16:38.848
once they spend their time
working in the missile field,

16:38.917 --> 16:40.484
they'll kind of write their name,

16:40.586 --> 16:44.654
and put in a time frame of how
many years they spent out here.

16:44.757 --> 16:46.990
We're at about
60 to 80 feet below ground.

16:48.460 --> 16:49.893
So this is the first blast door,

16:49.995 --> 16:52.763
to protect measures of, you know,
before you get the capsule,

16:52.865 --> 16:56.032
who also has another blast door, too.

16:56.135 --> 16:57.501
And the purpose of this is...

16:57.603 --> 16:59.970
Pretty much to sustain the
equipment down here so nothing...

17:00.072 --> 17:01.371
In the case of a nuclear attack?

17:01.473 --> 17:02.706
Exactly. Exactly.

17:07.412 --> 17:10.480
Larsen: <i> This command capsule can
launch a nuclear missile strike</i>

17:10.582 --> 17:12.782
<i>against any target on the planet.</i>

17:12.885 --> 17:17.220
<i>The officers here pull 24-hour
shifts called "alerts."</i>

17:17.321 --> 17:19.823
<i>During that period,
they're responsible for ten</i>

17:19.925 --> 17:24.828
<i>of the 450 intercontinental
ballistic missiles, or ICBMs,</i>

17:24.930 --> 17:28.899
<i>buried at three bases
around the American West.</i>

17:29.001 --> 17:31.701
So we're having a little party
down here in the capsule today?

17:31.804 --> 17:32.969
Uh, it seems like.

17:33.071 --> 17:35.005
It's my 100 alert,

17:35.107 --> 17:39.876
so Lieutenant Busbee surprised
me with a cookie cake.

17:39.978 --> 17:42.879
Larsen: <i>One hundred
alerts means 2,400 hours</i>

17:42.981 --> 17:45.882
<i>locked in a bunker
no bigger than a family van,</i>

17:45.984 --> 17:47.884
<i>which may seem like a long time,</i>

17:47.986 --> 17:51.121
<i>but there have been officers
on continuous alert in here</i>

17:51.223 --> 17:53.256
<i>since 1963.</i>

17:53.358 --> 17:55.759
It might be super old,

17:55.861 --> 17:57.994
but it's still reliable

17:58.096 --> 18:00.730
and it still gets the mission done.

18:00.833 --> 18:02.866
Do you guys ever have
the feeling like,

18:02.968 --> 18:04.734
"Hey, we practice these things
all the time,

18:04.837 --> 18:06.970
"but we never actually use them"?

18:07.072 --> 18:08.505
We use these every day.

18:08.607 --> 18:10.473
The mission is deterrence.

18:10.576 --> 18:14.878
And part of deterrence
is being capable of doing it.

18:14.980 --> 18:19.416
So if the president
wants to actually launch,

18:19.518 --> 18:20.951
we are ready to go.

18:23.989 --> 18:25.722
Push door open.

18:25.824 --> 18:29.459
Three, two, one, mark.

18:29.561 --> 18:31.962
Larsen: <i>Many people thought
that when the Cold War ended,</i>

18:32.064 --> 18:34.231
<i>these weapons would go away too,</i>

18:34.333 --> 18:35.765
<i>but they never did.</i>

18:35.868 --> 18:39.469
<i>And the Air Force tests them regularly
at a secure base in California</i>

18:39.571 --> 18:42.072
<i>to show the world
that they still work.</i>

18:42.174 --> 18:43.773
<i>At a launch in late February,</i>

18:43.876 --> 18:47.110
<i>Pentagon leadership was
on hand to make sure.</i>

18:47.212 --> 18:49.112
Even though these
systems are getting old,

18:49.214 --> 18:53.416
anyone who is a nuclear power is
sure to be watching these tests

18:53.518 --> 18:55.819
and has to be at least aware

18:55.921 --> 18:59.756
that the United States nuclear deterrent
is as strong as it has ever been.

18:59.858 --> 19:02.926
Larsen: <i> The next morning, we sat
down with Deputy Secretary Work</i>

19:03.028 --> 19:05.028
<i>to ask him why he thinks
it's still important</i>

19:05.130 --> 19:06.897
<i>to have nuclear weapons at all.</i>

19:06.999 --> 19:09.232
The president, your boss, has said

19:09.334 --> 19:11.735
he'd like to see a world
without nuclear weapons.

19:11.837 --> 19:14.504
How does that play into the
current modernization program?

19:14.606 --> 19:19.342
Well, what the president says, in addition
to wanting to get rid of nuclear weapons,

19:19.444 --> 19:21.711
he says as long as we have them,

19:21.813 --> 19:24.681
they are going to be
safe, secure, and effective.

19:24.783 --> 19:27.851
So he recognizes very clearly,

19:27.953 --> 19:31.221
that as long as adversaries or
potential rivals or countries

19:31.323 --> 19:33.189
have nuclear weapons,
we're going to have them too.

19:33.292 --> 19:35.859
So as long as that is
our national policy,

19:35.961 --> 19:37.460
we will recapitalize them.

19:37.562 --> 19:41.464
Larsen: <i> The United States still
controls a massive nuclear arsenal</i>

19:41.566 --> 19:43.967
<i>powerful enough to end
the world as we know it.</i>

19:44.069 --> 19:46.836
<i>It's made up of what's called
the nuclear triad:</i>

19:46.939 --> 19:48.805
<i>Land-based ICBMS,</i>

19:48.907 --> 19:50.573
<i>gravity bombs and cruise missiles</i>

19:50.676 --> 19:52.275
<i>dropped from
long-range bombers,</i>

19:52.377 --> 19:54.177
<i>and missiles launched from submarines</i>

19:54.279 --> 19:55.845
<i>that hide in the ocean.</i>

19:55.948 --> 19:57.714
<i>Now, the military wants to spend</i>

19:57.816 --> 19:59.482
<i>as much as a trillion dollars</i>

19:59.584 --> 20:01.551
<i>to modernize all of it.</i>

20:01.653 --> 20:03.586
<i>And that's ignited an intense debate</i>

20:03.689 --> 20:06.056
<i>about whether we should
be spending so much</i>

20:06.158 --> 20:08.591
<i>on weapons we'll likely never use.</i>

20:08.694 --> 20:10.894
We spend more money
on nuclear weapons

20:10.996 --> 20:13.563
than all other countries combined.

20:13.665 --> 20:15.966
This is the epitome of overkill.

20:16.068 --> 20:18.201
Let's start the year
by putting to rest the notion

20:18.303 --> 20:20.704
that our nuclear deterrent
is unaffordable.

20:20.806 --> 20:22.539
That's just ridiculous.

20:22.641 --> 20:25.008
Larsen: <i>At the top of the
Pentagon's wish list</i>

20:25.110 --> 20:27.911
<i>is a new fleet of
nuclear-armed submarines.</i>

20:28.013 --> 20:33.383
<i>We traveled to an undisclosed location
off the southern coast to see why.</i>

20:34.953 --> 20:36.152
Larsen:
It's a pretty surreal feeling

20:36.254 --> 20:37.821
to be in the middle of the ocean

20:37.923 --> 20:40.924
and to come up on
a ballistic missile submarine.

20:41.026 --> 20:42.726
It looks like a giant steel whale.

20:42.828 --> 20:44.894
<i>This is the USS</i> Wyoming.

20:44.997 --> 20:47.831
<i>Beneath these hatches are
underwater launch missiles</i>

20:47.933 --> 20:51.167
<i>that together carry seven
times the total firepower</i>

20:51.269 --> 20:54.170
<i>unleashed during World War II.</i>

20:54.272 --> 20:57.841
Cue the launch of the 1C dive, dive.
Two blasts to dive alarm. Dive, dive.

20:57.943 --> 21:02.979
Dive! Dive!

21:03.081 --> 21:05.382
Establish launch conditions.
This is the captain.

21:05.484 --> 21:06.916
This is an exercise.

21:07.019 --> 21:08.818
Boat is XO, target package ID.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.354
Whiskey, Yankee, Oscar
has been directed.

21:11.456 --> 21:15.158
Larsen: <i> The crew simulates launching a
nuclear strike several times a day.</i>

21:15.260 --> 21:17.894
Obtain the launch key. Obtain
the launch key. Aye, sir.

21:17.996 --> 21:21.164
Why do you drill this component
of the mission so often?

21:21.266 --> 21:24.601
The nation as a whole is depending
on us to be able to deliver

21:24.703 --> 21:26.636
<i>whenever the president tasks us.</i>

21:26.738 --> 21:30.140
Any time of day, any time of night.
We cannot fail.

21:30.242 --> 21:32.075
Fourteen, aweigh.

21:32.177 --> 21:34.511
Fourteen, aweigh.

21:34.613 --> 21:37.180
Larsen: <i> That urgency is one of
the Navy's major justifications</i>

21:37.282 --> 21:40.283
<i>for replacing these submarines
with new ones.</i>

21:40.385 --> 21:45.822
<i>The core function here is to keep these 24
missile tubes up and running at all times.</i>

21:45.924 --> 21:47.490
<i>But the equipment that runs them,</i>

21:47.592 --> 21:49.025
<i>and much of the rest of the ship</i>

21:49.127 --> 21:52.028
<i>is getting too old to be reliable.</i>

21:52.130 --> 21:54.130
This is like 1970s technology.

21:54.232 --> 21:58.735
The size of it, which you see in an
old movie, you know, in a warehouse.

21:58.837 --> 22:02.605
So the upgrade for the Ohio
replacement will take this room

22:02.707 --> 22:07.544
and could probably put it into
basically a laptop-size computer.

22:07.646 --> 22:10.780
And then the hardware
that's made to run this

22:10.882 --> 22:13.550
is so out of date that it costs
the government more money

22:13.652 --> 22:15.952
to have someone actually
go back in and build that,

22:16.054 --> 22:17.921
and to be able to repair
some of that stuff, so...

22:18.023 --> 22:19.789
Space is very vital on a submarine,

22:19.891 --> 22:23.493
so every single big cabinet that we have
is taking away space from the crew.

22:25.764 --> 22:28.631
This is a nine-man bunk room. Okay.

22:28.733 --> 22:29.699
Right here next to the missiles?

22:29.801 --> 22:32.001
Next to the missiles.
We sleep with them.

22:33.672 --> 22:36.639
What's it like to sleep
between missile tubes?

22:36.741 --> 22:38.741
It feels kind of odd sleeping,

22:38.844 --> 22:40.710
you know, on a weapon
of mass destruction,

22:40.812 --> 22:42.879
but, you know,
you get used to it, I guess.

22:42.981 --> 22:44.314
It comes with the job.

22:44.416 --> 22:46.716
Larsen: <i>If the Navy gets its way
and we do buy new submarines,</i>

22:46.818 --> 22:51.488
<i>the first one is projected to cost
at least 8.8 billion dollars.</i>

22:51.590 --> 22:56.025
<i>And the eleven subsequent ships would cost
more than five billion dollars apiece.</i>

22:56.128 --> 23:00.296
<i>And that's just one part of the
nuclear modernization shopping spree.</i>

23:00.398 --> 23:02.899
The Air Force released more
details about its plans

23:03.001 --> 23:04.868
for a new long-range
strike bomber.

23:04.970 --> 23:07.070
Larsen: <i>A brand-new
fleet of B-21 bombers,</i>

23:07.172 --> 23:09.339
<i>to replace the B-2
and other models,</i>

23:09.441 --> 23:12.609
<i>could cost more
than 100 billion dollars.</i>

23:12.711 --> 23:15.578
<i>Stephen Schwartz is
a nuclear weapons analyst</i>

23:15.680 --> 23:19.048
<i>who says all this spending
is getting out of control.</i>

23:19.151 --> 23:21.684
We're actually spending more today

23:21.786 --> 23:24.020
to maintain and sustain

23:24.122 --> 23:25.955
and modernize our nuclear arsenal

23:26.057 --> 23:29.159
than we spent on average
during the Cold War

23:29.261 --> 23:31.327
when we were building
new nuclear weapons

23:31.429 --> 23:33.363
and testing them on a regular basis.

23:33.465 --> 23:34.831
That's just incredible.

23:34.933 --> 23:36.733
Do you ever step outside
your job and be like,

23:36.835 --> 23:42.405
"This is crazy. We've built the
world's most expensive, elite,

23:42.507 --> 23:45.808
practice football team that
we hope never plays a game"?

23:45.911 --> 23:48.411
Right. Well, the people
on the other side will say,

23:48.513 --> 23:50.580
"We use nuclear weapons every
day." I'm sure you've heard that.

23:50.682 --> 23:52.482
You know, the other
argument they'll say is,

23:52.584 --> 23:54.584
"Well, obviously,
all this stuff worked.

23:54.686 --> 23:56.586
"Okay, we spent trillions of dollars.

23:56.688 --> 23:58.788
We built all these weapons.
We're still here."

23:58.890 --> 24:02.659
That's a myth. That's probably the
number one myth of the Cold War.

24:02.761 --> 24:04.294
We could've done it with a lot less.

24:04.396 --> 24:06.196
How much? I don't know.
But we didn't need it all.

24:06.298 --> 24:07.697
We definitely didn't need it all.

24:07.799 --> 24:10.033
Larsen: <i>But even though
our arsenal was huge,</i>

24:10.135 --> 24:11.701
<i>it followed a certain logic.</i>

24:11.803 --> 24:14.070
<i>The weapons were
so big and so destructive</i>

24:14.172 --> 24:18.908
<i>that both sides knew
they would never be used.</i>

24:19.010 --> 24:21.678
<i>But now that we're modernizing,
we're building a new weapon</i>

24:21.780 --> 24:23.746
<i>that's moving us
in the opposite direction.</i>

24:26.184 --> 24:28.451
<i>At the National Security
Campus in Kansas City,</i>

24:28.553 --> 24:32.188
<i>technicians are working on
a polarizing new project.</i>

24:32.290 --> 24:34.591
Behind me is a trainer model

24:34.693 --> 24:37.360
of the B61-12 gravity bomb.

24:37.462 --> 24:41.064
This weapon itself has
become very controversial

24:41.166 --> 24:45.868
because of its ability to target
more accurately and to be smaller.

24:45.971 --> 24:48.871
<i>The explosive yield
of the B61-12</i>

24:48.974 --> 24:52.242
<i>can be throttled down
to .3 kilotons,</i>

24:52.344 --> 24:54.244
<i>a thousand times less powerful</i>

24:54.346 --> 24:56.813
<i>than the warhead
on our current ICBMs.</i>

24:56.915 --> 24:58.915
<i>And a new tailfin allows it</i>

24:59.017 --> 25:00.850
<i>to be guided directly to its target,</i>

25:00.952 --> 25:04.220
<i>giving it accuracy that our
nuclear bombs have never had.</i>

25:04.322 --> 25:06.289
<i>Taken together, those traits could</i>

25:06.391 --> 25:08.258
<i>make these weapons more usable</i>

25:08.360 --> 25:10.093
<i>in the minds of American commanders.</i>

25:10.195 --> 25:13.863
<i>Dr. William Perry was in
charge of America's nukes</i>

25:13.965 --> 25:16.599
<i>as our 19th Secretary of Defense.</i>

25:16.701 --> 25:19.702
It's hard to argue
there's anything wrong

25:19.804 --> 25:22.538
with having lower yields
or more accuracies.

25:22.641 --> 25:23.706
But in fact, there is.

25:23.808 --> 25:25.608
We can devise tactical situations

25:25.710 --> 25:27.377
in which we might want to use it.

25:27.479 --> 25:31.547
The problem is,
those tactical situations

25:31.650 --> 25:33.349
are a snare and a delusion

25:33.451 --> 25:35.885
<i>because they lead us into believing</i>

25:35.987 --> 25:38.721
<i>we can use nuclear weapons
at lower levels of danger</i>

25:38.823 --> 25:42.358
<i>that would not lead to a full-scale
attack on the United States,</i>

25:42.460 --> 25:45.194
that would not lead
to a full-scale nuclear war.

25:45.297 --> 25:47.797
That's a very,
very dangerous assumption.

25:47.899 --> 25:51.734
Larsen: <i>At the age of 88,
Perry's now the leading voice</i>

25:51.836 --> 25:55.138
<i>warning that we're in increasing
danger of a nuclear disaster.</i>

25:55.240 --> 25:56.673
The threat is real.

25:56.775 --> 26:00.143
In a sense, we are living
on borrowed time.

26:00.245 --> 26:03.579
Larsen: <i>Which is all the more
striking because during the Cold War,</i>

26:03.682 --> 26:06.983
<i>he helped build up our nuclear
force to what it is today.</i>

26:07.085 --> 26:09.652
I've devoted a lot of my career
helping to build this deterrence

26:09.754 --> 26:11.421
because I believed it was important.

26:11.523 --> 26:13.289
Even as I did that,

26:13.391 --> 26:15.558
I understood that it was
a dangerous situation,

26:15.660 --> 26:18.428
that we should be looking
for some way out of the trap.

26:18.530 --> 26:20.063
I did not see any way out of it

26:20.165 --> 26:22.432
when there was a Soviet Union
that was hostile.

26:22.534 --> 26:25.535
But when the Cold War ended,
that opened up the possibility

26:25.637 --> 26:27.203
of moving away from deterrence.

26:27.305 --> 26:29.739
And we did start moving away
for the first few years,

26:29.841 --> 26:32.475
but now we're falling back
into the deterrence trap.

26:32.577 --> 26:36.713
Are we in danger of a new
nuclear escalation though?

26:36.815 --> 26:39.682
Yes, we are, already, in a sense,

26:39.784 --> 26:41.818
<i>restarting the nuclear arms race.</i>

26:41.920 --> 26:43.486
<i>Even more dangerously,</i>

26:43.588 --> 26:45.922
we're on the threshold
of starting a new Cold War.

26:46.024 --> 26:48.825
Larsen: <i>That's because
the more we modernize,</i>

26:48.927 --> 26:53.029
<i>the harder it is to convince countries
like China, North Korea, or Russia</i>

26:53.131 --> 26:55.798
<i>not to ratchet up
their own nuclear programs.</i>

26:55.900 --> 26:57.467
Anchorman:
<i>A key question tonight:</i>

26:57.569 --> 27:01.204
<i>How will Russia respond to
America's enhanced nuclear bombs?</i>

27:08.380 --> 27:12.215
Larsen: <i> When President Obama hosted a nuclear
security summit in March of this year,</i>

27:12.317 --> 27:15.885
<i>Russia refused to attend.</i>

27:15.987 --> 27:19.489
<i>At the same time, Russia is building
new submarines and missiles,</i>

27:19.591 --> 27:22.959
<i>and they're warning that they
may be forced to use them.</i>

27:32.537 --> 27:36.339
The Russians have used terms
about nuclear weapons

27:36.441 --> 27:38.741
that we view
as extremely destabilizing.

27:38.843 --> 27:41.878
This is stuff we haven't heard
since the Cold War, literally.

27:41.980 --> 27:43.513
And the Russians have said,

27:43.615 --> 27:46.382
"Look, we'll go
to nuclear weapons early.

27:46.484 --> 27:48.851
We will escalate
to deescalate."

27:48.953 --> 27:52.288
<i>Once you start up the escalatory
ladder with a nuclear weapon,</i>

27:52.390 --> 27:55.057
<i>you don't know where
you're going to end up.</i>

27:56.361 --> 27:58.728
Are we living in
dangerous nuclear times?

27:58.830 --> 28:01.063
I believe...

28:01.166 --> 28:04.233
that the likelihood
of a nuclear catastrophe today

28:04.335 --> 28:06.636
is greater than it was
during the Cold War.

28:06.738 --> 28:10.173
And our public is
blissfully unaware of that.

28:10.275 --> 28:13.543
Is there any way out of this?

28:13.645 --> 28:15.711
Maybe not, but I hope so.

28:15.814 --> 28:17.680
The first thing we have to do
is don't make it worse.

28:17.782 --> 28:21.083
If we go ahead with the complete
remodernization of the force today,

28:21.186 --> 28:23.619
we're just digging the hole deeper.

28:23.721 --> 28:25.888
Sooner or later,
we've got to get out of it.

28:25.990 --> 28:27.757
It's not going to be soon,

28:27.859 --> 28:29.579
but we ought to be moving
in that direction,

28:29.627 --> 28:31.561
not in the wrong direction.
