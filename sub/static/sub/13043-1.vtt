00:28.898 --> 00:30.525
The first day a girl is found dead,

00:32.302 --> 00:33.428
with her head emptied out.

00:35.405 --> 00:37.168
Perhaps she had remembered
the truth.

00:39.242 --> 00:41.870
Another girl dies on the second day,

00:42.312 --> 00:44.780
with her legs hacked off.

00:44.914 --> 00:48.247
Perhaps she had come near the truth.

00:50.853 --> 00:53.617
A girl is found dead
on the third day again,

00:53.756 --> 00:55.621
with her ears cut off.

00:56.359 --> 00:59.624
Perhaps she had heard the truth.

01:00.330 --> 01:03.299
The fourth day a girl dies again,

01:04.367 --> 01:07.131
with her eyes gouged out.

01:07.303 --> 01:10.295
Perhaps she had seen the truth.

01:11.007 --> 01:16.639
The fifth day a girl dies,
with her tongue pulled out.

01:16.746 --> 01:19.977
Perhaps she had spoken the truth.

01:20.383 --> 01:27.312
The sixth day a girl dies,
with her hands chopped off.

01:27.523 --> 01:31.323
Perhaps she had written the truth.

01:31.861 --> 01:34.489
And on the seventh day,
a girl is going to die.

01:34.597 --> 01:36.326
Perhaps...

02:28.918 --> 02:31.409
KIM Min-sun

02:33.456 --> 02:36.323
PARK Yeh-jin

02:38.261 --> 02:40.889
LEE Young-jin

03:29.479 --> 03:36.442
Momento Mori, The second story

03:54.570 --> 03:56.128
- Hello Mr. GOH!
- Hi.

03:58.007 --> 03:59.207
Hey, something's on your hair.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.497
The first kiss is like
the smell of fresh apples...

04:24.567 --> 04:28.333
I've smelled the blood on your lips,
that I've touched with my tongue..

04:40.349 --> 04:42.340
The Waters of the eastern sea
And the Baekdu mountains

04:42.418 --> 04:45.012
till the day they dry out

04:45.555 --> 04:48.217
Hey you sleepy heads.

04:48.391 --> 04:49.591
Tired from working late hours?

04:50.560 --> 04:52.790
You smell stink of liquor.

04:53.496 --> 04:54.976
She's shaking her legs
like a mad dog.

04:55.565 --> 04:58.193
- Hey, what's this for?
- Hey give it back!

04:58.301 --> 04:59.063
It's a letter to my boyfriend!

04:59.135 --> 05:00.864
There are so many weirdos
in this class.

05:01.170 --> 05:05.038
- What do you think you're doing?
- How dare you!

05:05.141 --> 05:06.472
You're copying homework.

05:06.576 --> 05:08.544
Hey give it to me
when you're done with it.

05:09.512 --> 05:11.480
Shit, there are only two fans in
this class!

05:11.581 --> 05:13.549
Are they worried about the
students' well being or what?

05:13.749 --> 05:15.546
This classroom is so damn hot.

05:16.252 --> 05:18.880
Here are some students putting
on a make-up.

05:19.555 --> 05:20.522
Let's have a word with them.

05:20.590 --> 05:23.190
- Getting ready for the night job?
- No, just want to look pretty.

05:23.259 --> 05:25.420
It will take lot more than
that for you to look pretty.

05:25.595 --> 05:25.890
Hey!

05:25.962 --> 05:27.520
- MOON Ji-won!
- Hi!

05:28.598 --> 05:29.598
Hi! What's that?

05:30.633 --> 05:31.633
A camcorder?

05:32.635 --> 05:33.226
Wait! Wait!

05:33.603 --> 05:34.603
Hey.

05:37.473 --> 05:38.599
Let me show you something.

05:39.642 --> 05:40.734
Cute, huh?

05:41.444 --> 05:42.570
Really damn cute?

05:42.778 --> 05:45.076
Cute, my ass...!

05:47.116 --> 05:51.678
It's class queen No. 2 of Rm. 2-11.
KIM, give us a big hello.

05:52.388 --> 05:54.549
Please be good to me, I'm Miss Kim.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.093
Good god!

05:58.194 --> 06:00.526
Who is our true No. 1?

06:00.896 --> 06:02.989
Me, me!

06:04.367 --> 06:04.867
It's, me!

06:05.034 --> 06:10.028
Moon Ji-won!
Woman with the brains and the looks.

06:10.406 --> 06:12.601
Hey, Moon Ji-won! Give it back!

06:12.708 --> 06:15.677
It's for taping chorus practice.

06:15.811 --> 06:17.335
There's no tape inside anyway!

06:19.415 --> 06:21.855
Hey, did you know that the
Coach was boasting about how he had

06:22.418 --> 06:23.214
pocketed our tuition last winter
training? -How did you know that?

06:24.920 --> 06:26.012
"Happy Birthday"

06:26.088 --> 06:27.088
Everyone else knows.

06:35.264 --> 06:38.233
You must be out of your mind!!
What if we get caught!

06:38.300 --> 06:39.267
Stop it! Or I'm gonna kill you.

06:39.502 --> 06:40.628
- Come here.
- What?

06:40.703 --> 06:42.261
Hide!

07:28.384 --> 07:30.352
What's that? Another present?
It's about time huh?

07:30.853 --> 07:36.450
- Why don't you open it?
- No thanks.

07:38.661 --> 07:39.661
Don't brag!

07:43.232 --> 07:44.232
What's this?

07:44.934 --> 07:45.934
Gosh!

07:46.535 --> 07:48.560
- Give it to me!
- What is it?

07:48.671 --> 07:50.366
Well! What is it?

07:55.044 --> 07:56.773
T.. T.. Teacher!

07:56.879 --> 07:59.905
Good morning, ma'am.

08:10.659 --> 08:13.389
"All students assemble in the
school auditorium."

08:13.462 --> 08:14.520
What're you doing?

08:14.997 --> 08:16.294
Shush!

08:16.999 --> 08:17.999
What the?...

08:29.345 --> 08:30.744
What the hell are you doing here?

08:33.315 --> 08:34.315
Hey, Min Hyo-shin.

08:36.217 --> 08:37.582
Look what you've done.

08:44.527 --> 08:49.328
Stare at the wall like that
and you'll go crazy.

09:12.354 --> 09:15.551
Shi-eun, know what
an eye-buddha is?

09:16.592 --> 09:19.459
Eye-buddha? No. What's that?

09:19.829 --> 09:20.829
Look into my eyes.

09:22.331 --> 09:23.764
- What for?
- Just do it.

09:26.202 --> 09:28.136
Can't you see something?

09:29.338 --> 09:31.602
- No, nothing.
- Look closer!

09:34.243 --> 09:35.642
I can only see myself.

09:52.361 --> 09:53.828
Hyo-shin! Let me save you!

10:01.337 --> 10:03.430
Shi-eun, wanna share a diary together?

10:05.374 --> 10:08.343
I'm not good at such things.

10:10.079 --> 10:12.547
Come on. It'll be good for
passing time in class.

10:14.717 --> 10:17.242
I wrote something today,
so it's your turn to write.

10:22.691 --> 10:23.691
O.K..

10:31.367 --> 10:34.097
Hyo-shin, hey, Hyo-shin!

10:35.938 --> 10:37.235
Get up.

10:38.741 --> 10:39.741
Min Hyo-shin!

10:40.242 --> 10:43.769
They both won the 200m race.

10:45.614 --> 10:50.551
People say a good sprinter
must live off of noodles.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.720
Guess that's why you
can't run well. No noodles!

10:57.293 --> 10:59.193
- Got any tissue?
- Wait a second.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
What's it for?

11:06.669 --> 11:07.829
I still can't hear well.

11:10.205 --> 11:12.230
The doctor told me
I shouldn't be running.

11:12.341 --> 11:16.573
You have a bad ear,
and I keep hearing things.

11:16.845 --> 11:17.845
What kind of things?

11:20.482 --> 11:25.249
In fact, I heard a bell going off
when I saw you for the first time.

11:26.655 --> 11:27.781
Bull shit!

11:31.493 --> 11:33.413
- I'm telling the truth!
- You're crazy! Go away!

12:21.410 --> 12:23.935
After the desperate scud,
and the last sperm shouted,

12:29.351 --> 12:32.752
it isn't how you live,
but how you die that counts!

12:33.188 --> 12:34.188
What is it!

12:46.502 --> 12:47.502
What's this?

12:49.538 --> 12:50.538
A camcorder?

12:51.473 --> 12:54.033
Who gave you permission to record
my class!

12:57.046 --> 12:58.479
I don't know.

12:59.515 --> 13:00.596
Give me the damn tape. Now!

13:01.617 --> 13:02.709
I said, now!

13:05.487 --> 13:06.818
Where did this come from?

13:07.456 --> 13:10.823
Yeon-ahn, the teacher is asking
for the tape.

13:10.993 --> 13:12.017
Hurry up!

13:15.831 --> 13:18.425
- Look what you've done.
- It's all your fault.

13:19.868 --> 13:20.868
Why is it my fault?

13:21.737 --> 13:22.737
Shut up!

13:23.572 --> 13:24.572
Who told you to speak?

13:29.845 --> 13:31.745
- Look.
- What?

13:31.814 --> 13:33.907
- The idiot can't even open it.
- Stupid jerk!

13:36.485 --> 13:37.485
Shut up you two!

13:38.287 --> 13:39.287
Come over here.

13:39.354 --> 13:40.719
On the double!

13:44.493 --> 13:45.926
Haven't you learned anything?

13:48.597 --> 13:49.894
Why am I wasting my time again.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.473
Come back after you've cleaned
out the animal cages.

13:53.769 --> 13:54.769
Again?

13:54.937 --> 13:58.202
What do you mean, again?
Get out of my sight.

13:59.808 --> 14:00.900
What about the camcorder?

14:01.243 --> 14:02.243
Get lost!

14:04.746 --> 14:06.373
Do you have to be dismissed?

14:08.450 --> 14:09.850
At least get your physical checkup.

14:10.385 --> 14:11.385
Do I have to?

14:11.987 --> 14:13.579
I got one last year.

14:15.124 --> 14:16.284
Haven't you grown since then?

14:18.560 --> 14:19.560
I guess so.

14:24.199 --> 14:27.930
You're pressing charges
against the coach.

14:28.804 --> 14:30.101
Be more specific.

14:35.677 --> 14:38.840
Hmm, the whole track team

14:39.982 --> 14:42.109
Hyo-shin, it's been a while.

14:45.821 --> 14:46.821
Hyo-shin

14:49.057 --> 14:50.057
Min Hyo-shin

14:53.162 --> 14:54.922
Wow, our telepathy still
seems to be working.

14:56.165 --> 14:57.486
But you insisted on not using it.

14:59.368 --> 15:00.368
You look well.

15:02.404 --> 15:04.497
It's been exactly 31 days
and 8 hours.

15:04.606 --> 15:07.074
- Mr. GOH, do you have a light?
- Uh, yes.

15:08.610 --> 15:12.569
What's your problem?
Always asking to be dismissed

15:13.282 --> 15:14.322
Go back to your classroom!

15:16.752 --> 15:19.033
Why don't you take a rest in the
nursing room for a while.

15:19.154 --> 15:20.154
Yes sir.

15:20.222 --> 15:22.656
- Don't go anywhere else.
- Yes sir.

15:23.192 --> 15:26.719
The kids are now bringing
camcorders to watch us.

15:26.862 --> 15:29.160
What is this world coming to?

15:29.698 --> 15:33.099
It's because you're popular
with the students.

15:34.136 --> 15:37.537
What if the vice-principal
is behind all this?

15:38.006 --> 15:39.127
What's wrong with you again?

15:40.943 --> 15:41.943
You look just fine.

15:45.681 --> 15:47.512
O.K. Only for a while, though!

15:48.217 --> 15:49.217
Thank you.

16:00.729 --> 16:04.165
When you feel down and out or
bored with life, take this pill.

16:04.533 --> 16:05.727
It will make you feel better.

16:09.238 --> 16:12.036
Pull for the pill!

16:34.930 --> 16:36.454
- SO Min-ah!
- Yes?

16:36.565 --> 16:39.125
- What's your room number?
- Room 11.

16:41.136 --> 16:43.104
- You took the medicine?
- Yes.

16:49.144 --> 16:50.144
Good.

17:11.833 --> 17:15.325
A bit bitter, isn't it?
It's the poison I made just for you.

17:17.873 --> 17:19.965
You'll die if you stop loving me.

17:21.710 --> 17:23.905
I'm making the antidote
But will it work?

17:23.979 --> 17:26.277
I'll let you know when it's done.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.289
Our own statement by Choi Yeon-ahn.

17:39.795 --> 17:41.888
The reason for refusing to wear the
uniforms are because they are

17:42.331 --> 17:44.561
the remnants of Japanese colonialism.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.124
The reason for going on blind dates

17:47.636 --> 17:52.096
is to practice the national
mission of enriching the mankind,

17:54.743 --> 17:56.304
And the reason why we sleep
in class is,

17:57.946 --> 18:00.210
we as youths need dreams.

18:01.783 --> 18:03.148
- Is that all?
- Yes sir.

18:04.686 --> 18:05.686
Very well.

18:06.755 --> 18:08.556
But next time,
don't quote from other's words.

18:10.359 --> 18:13.795
- Yes sir
- Next, Min Hyo-shin?

18:17.366 --> 18:18.697
Min Hyo-shin!

18:19.868 --> 18:20.868
It's your turn.

18:33.382 --> 18:35.077
"Poetry is Liberty"

18:37.986 --> 18:40.819
There is nothing,
There is Anything,

18:43.392 --> 18:45.690
But there isn't,
Perhaps there is,

18:47.095 --> 18:48.960
Perhaps there isn't,
Surely there is,

18:49.831 --> 18:51.822
Said there isn't, It's not true,

18:52.534 --> 18:53.899
There is truth,
The lie, there is,

18:54.403 --> 18:55.803
There is a lie,
The truth, there is,

18:56.138 --> 18:57.503
No one knows, No one cares,

18:58.273 --> 18:59.673
We know nothing,
We know everything,

19:00.008 --> 19:01.367
Still don't know,
There is an answer,

19:01.443 --> 19:02.637
There isn't an answer,
The truth there is,

19:02.711 --> 19:04.201
The truth there isn't,
The lie there isn't,

19:04.279 --> 19:05.337
The truth there is,
The truth is a lie,

19:05.414 --> 19:07.382
The lie is the
truth, I'm not sure,

19:07.449 --> 19:08.489
Anyone is me, I am anyone,

19:09.084 --> 19:10.574
Everybody is me I am everybody,

19:13.321 --> 19:14.481
Like the truth becomes a lie.

19:15.424 --> 19:16.516
That snob!

19:17.259 --> 19:18.851
Who does she think she is?

19:18.927 --> 19:19.927
Truth becomes a lie?

19:20.028 --> 19:21.791
"Our Birthdays"

19:29.137 --> 19:32.834
"July 9, Yoo Shi-eun Min Hyo-"

19:33.775 --> 19:34.775
What the hell!

19:49.458 --> 19:50.458
Get a life!

19:52.127 --> 19:53.127
Serves you damn right!

20:05.106 --> 20:09.440
Where the forget-me-not
dreams are

20:10.412 --> 20:16.275
Following the river
banks Hey, Shi-eun!

20:16.985 --> 20:17.985
Yoo Shi-eun!

20:19.321 --> 20:20.321
Stand up!

20:21.289 --> 20:22.415
Try singing by yourself!

20:37.138 --> 20:39.299
What are you doing?
Start from the beginning.

20:41.042 --> 20:42.669
Start again,
I'll do the count for you.

20:43.044 --> 20:44.739
One, two, three

20:48.550 --> 20:50.211
Listen carefully
and sing after me!

20:58.226 --> 21:02.822
Where the forget-me-not
dreams..

21:11.339 --> 21:12.339
Be careful.

21:13.074 --> 21:14.564
- What's in here?
- Come on.

22:02.924 --> 22:03.924
Can you hear it?

22:04.259 --> 22:05.380
The world is made of sounds.

22:10.031 --> 22:11.431
All the People have their own tune.

22:12.901 --> 22:15.563
It can become a harmony
or a dissonance.

22:16.938 --> 22:18.578
Together, we could make
a perfect harmony.

22:24.779 --> 22:26.576
You'll find a whole new world.

22:28.350 --> 22:29.578
You must remember this tune.

22:32.954 --> 22:34.394
If one of us dies before each other,

22:34.689 --> 22:36.449
promise to come for
the other on a rainy day.

22:38.026 --> 22:39.516
This pill will help.

22:41.796 --> 22:42.796
Hey, Hyo-shin?

22:49.004 --> 22:52.030
- What're you doing here?
- Huh? I'm sick.

23:03.451 --> 23:04.451
Stop it.

23:09.024 --> 23:11.925
It's been a while.
Happy birthday.

23:12.661 --> 23:15.186
- Are you O.K?
- Yeah, just a bit dizzy.

23:17.065 --> 23:19.124
The nurse joked that
my symptoms are just like

23:20.201 --> 23:21.562
the one that of an pregnant woman.

23:23.138 --> 23:25.629
- What a nut case!
- At last our own baby!

23:28.176 --> 23:31.111
- Come on.
- You're not smiling.

23:34.015 --> 23:35.573
- Hyo-shin
- How could you!

23:37.118 --> 23:39.245
You never called.

23:41.256 --> 23:44.487
I've been really sick.
Hey, about us...

23:46.995 --> 23:48.635
Let's go outside.
I have something to say.

24:07.282 --> 24:08.282
You're so wicked.

24:08.316 --> 24:13.015
Skipping classes when
you're not really sick.

24:14.222 --> 24:15.222
Hey, I'm sick.

24:16.191 --> 24:18.625
You can't be serious.
You were fine this morning!

24:19.394 --> 24:20.394
I'm really sick.

24:20.895 --> 24:24.228
Hey, we should hurry
and clean the animal cages

24:24.599 --> 24:26.430
or we'll be in trouble.

24:27.202 --> 24:29.363
I told you not to mess
with my camcorder!

24:29.871 --> 24:31.672
It's your fault we're
cleaning this deer shit!

24:32.140 --> 24:33.698
What's wrong with shit?

24:35.076 --> 24:36.356
Don't be bothered with the shit!

24:36.778 --> 24:39.679
Nothing better to do
than cleaning shit.

24:39.748 --> 24:42.979
Shut up! I'll be missing
chorus practice again!

24:43.752 --> 24:46.448
Do you really think I brought
my camcorder to film Mr. GOH?

24:46.688 --> 24:47.888
What're you gonna do about it?

24:47.956 --> 24:50.220
I want it back! Right now!

24:51.960 --> 24:56.522
Anyway, it's ridiculous to
record yourselves practicing.

24:56.765 --> 24:57.765
Oh brother!

24:58.333 --> 25:00.267
It's not even yours, is it?

25:01.336 --> 25:03.167
That's not the point.

25:03.271 --> 25:04.632
I was so embarrassed this morning.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.440
What for?

25:06.674 --> 25:08.665
Being punished in front
of my darling Mr. GOH

25:08.777 --> 25:10.711
I even had my arms up!

25:11.279 --> 25:12.610
So humiliating!

25:12.747 --> 25:14.476
It's not even the first time, right?

25:20.488 --> 25:27.257
Look. I've made eye contacts
with Mr. GOH in the toilet.

25:28.129 --> 25:31.462
He shook himself like this.
It was so damn great!

25:33.101 --> 25:34.101
Did you see his thing?

25:36.304 --> 25:37.635
No way.

25:40.208 --> 25:41.208
You pervert!

25:42.010 --> 25:46.743
This smells strange. Like shit.

25:47.415 --> 25:48.815
- Yeon-ahn, you taste it.
- Stop it!

25:51.619 --> 25:53.177
Do you remember Shi-eun's friend?

25:53.788 --> 25:55.483
Who? Yoo Shi-eun?
What about her?

25:55.557 --> 25:57.457
That girl from this morning

25:58.626 --> 26:00.666
She seems to be living
in the whole different world.

26:01.296 --> 26:03.093
Who do you mean? Who, who, who?

26:04.232 --> 26:05.232
Hyo-shin?

26:06.067 --> 26:08.365
She's the girl who plays
the piano in our chorus.

26:09.270 --> 26:10.591
She was the class nerd last year.

26:11.940 --> 26:13.805
But I heard the nerd was you.

26:15.310 --> 26:17.801
Real nerds never know
they are one.

26:18.213 --> 26:19.213
Who told you that?

26:19.681 --> 26:20.739
This place stinks!

26:21.850 --> 26:23.818
This is all your fault!

26:24.586 --> 26:26.451
Come on,
It's the smell of nature.

26:26.521 --> 26:29.422
It'll help you live a long
and healthy life.

26:30.024 --> 26:30.649
Is that so?

26:30.792 --> 26:33.784
- Then help yourself.
- Shit!

26:34.762 --> 26:36.559
So what's up with them
these days?

26:38.366 --> 26:40.300
Who? Shi-eun?

26:43.838 --> 26:46.739
They used to be inseparable.

26:47.642 --> 26:49.633
But nowadays they're acting
like strangers.

26:51.112 --> 26:52.807
Anyway, they're bad news.

27:06.728 --> 27:07.728
What's on the roof?

27:08.029 --> 27:09.029
You'll see.

27:10.231 --> 27:12.699
Students, Keep out!

27:48.870 --> 27:49.951
I really missed this place.

27:53.308 --> 27:54.832
Where did you get that?

27:56.744 --> 27:58.024
I stole it to film our birthday.

28:01.416 --> 28:07.548
Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday to you.

28:09.524 --> 28:10.524
How's your ankle?

28:13.027 --> 28:14.027
It's getting better.

28:14.362 --> 28:16.353
You'll win this time, won't you?

28:18.399 --> 28:20.867
What is it that you wanted
to say?

28:25.573 --> 28:30.101
This is great, isn't it?
Everyone should be in class.

28:33.114 --> 28:34.634
They're getting their
physical checkup.

28:36.084 --> 28:39.952
- You seem thinner.
- You seem taller.

28:45.626 --> 28:47.856
Can all the changes in
my weight and height,

28:49.931 --> 28:52.559
can these numerical values
truly explain my growth?

28:57.405 --> 28:58.405
Let's get going.

28:58.906 --> 29:00.567
- It's D-day.
- D-day?

29:01.476 --> 29:02.773
Yeah, let's stay a bit longer.

29:03.544 --> 29:05.671
- Doing what?
- Recording ourselves.

29:09.417 --> 29:10.611
- Uh
- Hey!

29:12.453 --> 29:13.453
Be careful.

29:15.456 --> 29:16.980
I really need to go.

29:22.530 --> 29:24.657
If you leave now

29:26.167 --> 29:28.158
I'll think you're still
avoiding me.

29:29.137 --> 29:32.004
I was also bored without you.
Does that make you happy?

29:34.809 --> 29:36.650
You're the one who always
talked about suicide.

29:38.346 --> 29:40.610
How would people remember
me if I were to die?

29:41.449 --> 29:43.212
I bet you know!

29:44.819 --> 29:50.655
A girl, nothing more.
A girl has died. Like that.

29:51.459 --> 29:52.983
You're too serious today.

29:54.529 --> 29:56.049
Told you we were supposed
to be reborn.

29:56.597 --> 29:57.678
What are you talking about?

30:01.736 --> 30:02.736
Hey, Hyo-shin!

30:05.273 --> 30:06.273
Min Hyo-shin!

30:10.878 --> 30:13.745
- Keep it down, O.K.?
- Sure.

30:15.416 --> 30:17.179
Flat chest! Flatty! Flatty!

30:17.251 --> 30:18.775
Moon Ji-won! 71cm!

30:22.090 --> 30:24.058
You said, keep it down!

30:24.492 --> 30:25.492
Hey, flatty!

30:25.827 --> 30:29.854
Take out the falsies!
Your breast don't look any bigger.

30:29.997 --> 30:33.057
What do you care? Have
you any idea how I feel?

30:33.401 --> 30:34.401
Like I care.

30:35.103 --> 30:36.103
Where's Min-ah?

30:37.105 --> 30:39.573
Let's start over again.

30:55.156 --> 30:56.156
Hey!

30:57.725 --> 30:59.920
- How'd it go?
- Did you tell?

31:01.129 --> 31:02.129
Not really

31:02.797 --> 31:04.765
I feel dizzy.

31:05.466 --> 31:07.798
I've been eating grapes
and cucumbers for a week.

31:07.902 --> 31:11.099
Then why don't you explain the
eggshells in your sack?

31:12.006 --> 31:14.065
Bullshitting again!

31:14.142 --> 31:15.803
I even shaved my legs!

31:17.245 --> 31:19.270
This time it has to work!

31:19.380 --> 31:21.940
Oh, dear! Shaved your forehead
for this, didn't you?

31:22.984 --> 31:23.984
Ouch!

31:26.988 --> 31:27.988
50kg!

31:28.956 --> 31:32.119
Something's wrong. Can you do
measure it again, please!

31:33.594 --> 31:35.289
- 51kg!
- Hey, you!

31:39.333 --> 31:42.928
- Still 51 kg, just eating cucumbers.
- Silence!

31:45.773 --> 31:46.773
What's their problem!

31:55.316 --> 31:58.615
44kg.

31:58.753 --> 31:59.753
44kg!

32:01.122 --> 32:02.089
Yeah?

32:02.114 --> 32:05.114
SharePirate. Com - Convenient
Downloads for Members

32:23.211 --> 32:24.691
Promise you'll wear them
for the race.

32:24.879 --> 32:26.176
Come by later.

32:26.247 --> 32:28.841
There's something else for you.

32:34.889 --> 32:39.189
- Can you hear something?
- Hear what?

32:40.761 --> 32:41.761
I'm serious.

32:43.898 --> 32:46.196
Stop hitting me! Moron!

32:47.201 --> 32:49.032
Just listen!

32:49.437 --> 32:51.871
That hurts, bitch!

33:15.129 --> 33:16.129
Let's try again.

33:16.497 --> 33:18.658
Something's wrong if
you can't hear it this time.

33:19.734 --> 33:20.734
Tell me if you can.

33:46.127 --> 33:48.254
Right hand. Right hand.

33:48.329 --> 33:51.264
Let's start over again
Let's start over again

33:51.332 --> 33:53.300
Right hand.

33:55.670 --> 33:56.670
Next.

33:58.906 --> 33:59.906
Next!

34:00.741 --> 34:02.732
What's so funny? Are you sick?

34:03.844 --> 34:06.813
Huh? Yeah, I don't feel so well.
A little dizzy.

34:07.214 --> 34:09.054
Didn't you take some pills
at the nursing room?

34:09.817 --> 34:11.284
Pills? Of course I did

34:11.886 --> 34:12.886
- Bitch!
- Bitch!

34:13.187 --> 34:15.280
Let go. It hurts.

34:37.445 --> 34:38.445
146.3cm!

34:39.380 --> 34:41.940
It must be broken.

34:42.350 --> 34:44.580
- No.
- Let me try again, please.

34:44.952 --> 34:45.850
Stop jerking around
and get off the scale.

34:46.554 --> 34:48.112
- Just this once.
- No!

34:48.188 --> 34:49.228
- Once more.
- No! 146.3cm.

34:49.357 --> 34:50.984
Please, just one more time.

34:51.692 --> 34:53.659
Please.

34:58.866 --> 35:00.299
Once more. Please.

35:00.368 --> 35:01.995
- Please!
- No!

35:02.370 --> 35:04.429
- Please.
- It'll be the same.

35:04.538 --> 35:07.530
- I beg you.
- I said no.

35:07.608 --> 35:08.608
Once more. Please.

35:08.609 --> 35:09.609
O.K. Then just this once.

35:24.291 --> 35:25.291
Get out! Move

36:41.168 --> 36:42.168
Jesus!

36:45.172 --> 36:46.733
Isn't she Min Hyo-shin
from classroom 3?

37:00.354 --> 37:01.651
Go back to your rooms!

37:18.739 --> 37:19.739
Attention!

37:21.509 --> 37:24.103
There has been a tragic
incident in Room 2-3.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.940
As you may know,
it is not the first time.

37:45.599 --> 37:47.319
Physical checkups will be
postponed for now.

37:49.336 --> 37:52.828
Be careful of yourselves!

37:55.042 --> 37:56.805
Calm down. Stop it.

38:05.553 --> 38:06.553
Anyway

38:07.087 --> 38:12.855
Stay cool and I believe this
won't happen in our class, right?

38:46.927 --> 38:50.556
Disgusting! I hate birds!

38:52.099 --> 38:53.299
Stop crying for Christ's sake!

38:59.573 --> 39:02.269
Why did she have to die
in school of all places?

39:07.281 --> 39:08.281
Hey!

39:16.290 --> 39:17.552
Where're Hyo-shin's things?

39:18.726 --> 39:20.216
Mr. GOH has already taken
everything.

39:20.761 --> 39:22.388
What's the use now?

39:36.010 --> 39:37.978
- Poor thing.
- No way.

39:38.078 --> 39:40.012
Kissing inside the school
day and night

39:40.080 --> 39:41.707
she had lived the life
to the fullest.

39:42.082 --> 39:44.209
Still, would you kill yourself
over some stupid debts?

39:44.652 --> 39:47.621
I bet this school is
fucking cursed.

39:48.789 --> 39:49.721
Six are dead... One more to go

39:49.790 --> 39:51.052
and it would be all over!

39:51.992 --> 39:54.290
- Over?
- Doomsday, stupid!

39:54.895 --> 39:57.887
It takes 7 deaths to close
the school down.

39:57.965 --> 39:58.590
Really?

39:58.666 --> 40:01.464
- Yeah, I guess it's your turn.
- Shut your mouth!

40:01.669 --> 40:06.333
There are rumors that someone was
with Hyo-shin when she died.

40:06.440 --> 40:07.498
Really? Who?

40:07.675 --> 40:09.435
Who else could it be?
Of course it's Shi-eun!

40:09.677 --> 40:11.304
She's such a bitch.

40:11.512 --> 40:13.472
Not a single sign of grief
over her lover's death.

40:13.514 --> 40:16.574
- Have you seen her?
- Me? Not really! Who cares?

40:17.851 --> 40:19.216
Stop kidding!

40:20.187 --> 40:21.654
Where the hell is she?

40:23.490 --> 40:26.152
Is it true Hyo-shin had
a footprint on her neck?

40:26.260 --> 40:28.990
She also had a bunch of
hair in her hand.

40:29.196 --> 40:30.925
Oh, I'm getting the chills

40:30.998 --> 40:34.126
Stop it! Shi-eun was with me.

40:45.479 --> 40:49.506
I should've bashed her
head last year

43:46.059 --> 43:47.059
Shi-eun?

43:51.899 --> 43:52.899
Shi-eun

44:14.121 --> 44:15.121
Shi-eun

44:23.864 --> 44:24.864
What do you want?

44:26.633 --> 44:28.624
What're you doing here?

44:30.437 --> 44:31.437
What about you?

44:34.541 --> 44:35.838
Neat place here...

44:43.583 --> 44:44.811
About Hyo-shin

44:48.722 --> 44:49.722
What about her?

44:53.493 --> 44:59.227
I saw you going up
to the roof with her.

45:00.968 --> 45:01.968
So what?

45:03.637 --> 45:04.729
What're you trying to say?

45:07.708 --> 45:09.107
You want to die as well?

45:18.986 --> 45:20.466
What were you trying
to do back there?

45:21.088 --> 45:24.080
What? Oh that?

45:25.759 --> 45:29.889
But we were a great match, though!

45:31.131 --> 45:32.496
Did I ask you for help?

45:39.339 --> 45:41.637
Music that comforts the soul?
Who made it?

45:43.477 --> 45:46.310
It'll help you win the race.

45:48.115 --> 45:49.207
I made it just for you.

46:00.193 --> 46:01.193
Hey, Shi-eun!

46:03.263 --> 46:03.888
Hello sir.

46:04.031 --> 46:05.071
Yoo Shi-eun, come up here!

46:08.001 --> 46:09.001
See you later.

46:12.973 --> 46:14.838
I understand

46:15.142 --> 46:18.839
You should not kill?
Everyone says that.

46:20.247 --> 46:22.613
But some people just can't help it.

46:24.351 --> 46:26.979
I'm not saying that
I will commit murder,

46:29.056 --> 46:33.857
but I can't promise that
I won't either.

46:35.562 --> 46:36.562
It depends.

46:39.066 --> 46:40.795
No one knows.

46:42.702 --> 46:44.192
Not even you Mr. GOH.

46:49.443 --> 46:51.468
Why are you always
wearing a grin on your face?

46:51.578 --> 46:53.637
You must really be enjoying school.

46:56.783 --> 46:57.783
Think so?

47:00.253 --> 47:01.693
On the contrary,
I'm quite depressed.

47:04.057 --> 47:06.719
All my colleagues are
so materialistic

47:08.962 --> 47:12.022
and the kids are so immature.

47:14.101 --> 47:15.821
You can mock and laugh
at them all you want,

47:17.771 --> 47:20.331
but all I can do is hide.

47:36.656 --> 47:39.591
You can't drink.
You don't know music.

47:39.659 --> 47:40.659
You can't do nothing!

47:56.877 --> 47:59.778
So you slept with him?

48:00.147 --> 48:02.547
- Well did you?
- I had no choice.

48:04.551 --> 48:05.551
He looked so weary.

48:07.154 --> 48:09.154
It wasn't bad doing it
It was sort of nice in a way

48:14.561 --> 48:17.655
What should I do?
I don't want us to break up.

48:19.733 --> 48:20.733
You do understand?

48:22.569 --> 48:25.037
I just needed a friend that night.

48:25.705 --> 48:27.002
I'm sorry I kept it from you.

48:30.544 --> 48:32.145
You're still the only one
for me, though.

48:36.883 --> 48:40.114
Tell you what
I can see your nose growing.

48:43.557 --> 48:44.557
Look into my eyes.

50:10.744 --> 50:11.244
In fact

50:11.278 --> 50:15.009
This is the shared diary
of Shi-eun and Hyo-shin.

50:16.049 --> 50:17.049
Hyo-shin's?

50:18.184 --> 50:20.243
Hey, was it those kids'?

50:21.221 --> 50:23.280
What're you doing with it?

50:23.456 --> 50:26.016
You could die if you read
the diary of the dead.

50:26.626 --> 50:27.626
- Really?
- Yeah!

50:29.262 --> 50:31.423
It was fun at first,
but now it's creepy,

50:32.699 --> 50:35.759
to find out all their secrets.

50:36.069 --> 50:39.596
Let me turn it over to the police.
It's the key evidence!

50:39.706 --> 50:42.800
Give me a break!
Give it to Mr. GOH.

50:46.379 --> 50:48.099
I feel weird. The candy
might be killing me.

50:50.664 --> 50:52.097
What're you talking about?

50:53.934 --> 50:57.062
She is so difficult to understand.

50:58.772 --> 51:00.613
It's Impossible to find out
what's on her Mind.

51:01.308 --> 51:03.173
Don't Mind her!
She was always strange.

51:03.243 --> 51:04.283
I'm going to the bathroom.

51:04.911 --> 51:07.038
- Where can Shi-eun be?
- How should I know?

51:09.015 --> 51:11.279
So Min-ah, the teacher
wants to see you.

51:12.953 --> 51:16.116
Was there anything strange
at the nursing room?

51:17.791 --> 51:20.851
She was right next to you.

51:24.531 --> 51:27.329
I took a pill and fell asleep.

51:29.703 --> 51:31.330
Were there any visitors?

51:37.644 --> 51:38.644
No sir...

51:41.181 --> 51:43.342
So what brought you there?

51:44.084 --> 51:45.084
Sir?

51:46.486 --> 51:47.976
You two were good friends, right?

51:48.822 --> 51:49.822
A while ago...

51:51.191 --> 51:52.191
I see.

51:53.159 --> 51:54.799
So you haven't seen
each other for a while

51:56.596 --> 51:57.596
Yes sir.

51:58.632 --> 52:00.112
Why is that?
Did you two have a fight?

52:05.972 --> 52:08.463
Haven't you seen her this morning?

52:15.515 --> 52:18.416
There are rumors that another
girl was on the roof

52:18.485 --> 52:21.079
Shi-eun was with me.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.324
I see. You must be heartbroken.

52:30.363 --> 52:31.484
Don't listen to such rumors.

52:39.406 --> 52:40.406
You can go now.

52:44.945 --> 52:47.004
Can I stay here sir?

52:49.115 --> 52:49.916
I can't believe you!

52:49.983 --> 52:52.645
Reading that stupid diary,
chasing after Shi-eun.

52:53.019 --> 52:54.699
Since when you have been so
close with her?

52:55.555 --> 52:56.595
You said she was bad luck!

52:57.490 --> 52:59.788
Come on, Stop it!

53:00.327 --> 53:01.327
Wait!

53:01.995 --> 53:03.035
So we mean nothing to you?

53:03.964 --> 53:05.295
Come on, Hyo-shin is dead.

53:06.066 --> 53:07.533
Hyo-shin? What about her?

53:08.768 --> 53:09.849
I knew her better than you.

53:11.671 --> 53:12.671
Stop it.

53:13.506 --> 53:16.168
Don't you feel any sympathy for her?

53:16.876 --> 53:19.174
It could happen to you.

53:19.245 --> 53:20.109
I'll think about it when
it does happen to me.

53:20.914 --> 53:23.144
I have better things to do
than to think of others!

53:24.484 --> 53:25.576
How can you say that?

53:26.419 --> 53:28.139
I feel like I'm talking to
a total stranger.

53:28.588 --> 53:29.588
Watch what you say.

53:30.323 --> 53:31.551
You think I'm not?

53:31.958 --> 53:33.918
Anyway, they're just simply bad
news all together.

53:35.195 --> 53:36.924
You've changed.

53:37.731 --> 53:38.731
Such a traitor!

53:47.307 --> 53:48.307
Shut the hell up!

53:51.678 --> 53:52.678
Hey!

53:53.213 --> 53:54.475
So, are you dating Shi-eun?

53:55.882 --> 53:56.882
Does she turn you on?

53:57.884 --> 53:58.884
Hey, Min-ah!

53:59.919 --> 54:00.919
Hey, you!

54:03.923 --> 54:05.220
Give me back my diary.

54:07.994 --> 54:09.859
Why did she kill herself?

54:11.331 --> 54:14.630
Stop saying that word.
It scares the shit out of me.

54:16.670 --> 54:19.434
Want to know why
she killed herself?

54:20.974 --> 54:22.168
- Want me to tell ya?
- Yeah

54:24.344 --> 54:26.505
It's because she was pregnant.

54:26.880 --> 54:27.880
Who said that?

54:29.315 --> 54:30.509
Haven't you heard?

54:31.151 --> 54:33.210
Everyone in school knows.

54:34.254 --> 54:36.254
Why would she kill herself
on physical checkup day?

54:37.123 --> 54:41.253
I chose a song for Hyo-shin.
Let's practice this today.

54:42.095 --> 54:43.095
Oh, no thanks!

54:43.763 --> 54:47.494
Our friend has died.
We can't just ignore that.

56:07.013 --> 56:08.693
Self-Portrait
Peel it off and you'll see me

56:12.952 --> 56:14.681
Be careful, you might regret this.

56:45.618 --> 56:50.578
The incantation that protects you...

57:02.168 --> 57:03.567
Remember the dead.

57:03.870 --> 57:05.167
Remember the dead?

57:07.540 --> 57:09.565
Memento Mori.

57:11.711 --> 57:12.711
Memento Mori?

57:15.682 --> 57:16.682
Memento Mori..

57:19.352 --> 57:20.352
Remember the dead

57:21.788 --> 57:23.779
Memento Mori..

59:06.292 --> 59:06.792
Min-ah!

59:07.160 --> 59:08.718
What's wrong! Wake up!

59:14.600 --> 59:15.760
Hurry and go get the teacher!

59:16.936 --> 59:18.096
- Is she O.K.?
- I don't know.

59:20.948 --> 59:21.948
Are you O.K.?

59:22.350 --> 59:23.350
Wake up. Min-ah!

59:27.788 --> 59:29.449
Yeon-ahn has something to say.

59:32.360 --> 59:33.360
Now!

59:35.396 --> 59:36.396
Forget about Hyo-shin

59:37.999 --> 59:39.728
She's not worth it.

59:42.003 --> 59:43.003
Told you to apologize.

59:46.107 --> 59:51.170
Min-ah, you were the last
person with Hyo-shin.

59:52.680 --> 59:55.148
Do you remember her last moments?

01:00:00.654 --> 01:00:02.884
Min-ah, you have my diary, don't you?

01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:05.191
Give it back!

01:05:07.895 --> 01:05:13.891
It's your day, Shi-eun!

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:51.068
The antidote.
Were you looking for this?

01:05:51.705 --> 01:05:52.763
Take it if you trust me

01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:21.367
Mr. GOH!

01:06:22.503 --> 01:06:23.697
- Yes?
- Hello, sir.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.768
What's going on between you two?

01:06:32.312 --> 01:06:35.213
Just say something, please.

01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:37.174
I can't take it anymore.

01:06:37.251 --> 01:06:38.946
That's enough.
It's getting late.

01:06:40.821 --> 01:06:42.118
Was Hyo-shin really pregnant?

01:06:44.958 --> 01:06:46.279
Who cares if she was.
No big deal.

01:06:48.095 --> 01:06:50.029
It's your silence that
makes me so pissed.

01:06:51.331 --> 01:06:52.593
She was weird anyway!

01:06:55.869 --> 01:06:56.869
Told you to stop.

01:06:58.005 --> 01:07:01.441
Why are you taking all this shit!

01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:04.502
You need to stand up for yourself!

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.904
What did you teach us?

01:07:09.583 --> 01:07:11.608
Were they just words?
I think not!

01:07:15.856 --> 01:07:18.120
Don't you have anything to say?

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.328
Did you really do it?

01:07:22.696 --> 01:07:24.721
You're just admitting to it
by being silent.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.761
You're really a two-faced asshole.

01:07:28.535 --> 01:07:30.230
Saying one thing and
doing another.

01:07:30.604 --> 01:07:31.685
After breaking up with you,

01:07:54.928 --> 01:08:00.798
she must have been preparing
this for months.

01:08:05.839 --> 01:08:08.535
Shi-eun, Happy Birthday.

01:08:09.743 --> 01:08:12.234
It would have been great
with Hyo-shin.

01:08:12.346 --> 01:08:13.346
It's not my birthday.

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:18.115
Shi-eun, stop!

01:08:20.687 --> 01:08:22.018
- Shi-eun
- Let go!

01:08:26.827 --> 01:08:27.827
Where are the pills?

01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:53.952
- It was you, wasn't it?
- What? Idiot!

01:09:17.678 --> 01:09:18.678
Hey, open up!

01:09:19.112 --> 01:09:20.112
It doesn't open!

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.045
Pull! Pull it hard!

01:10:17.638 --> 01:10:20.436
There's a strange smell from you.

01:10:23.644 --> 01:10:24.941
The scent of a lesbian!

01:10:28.315 --> 01:10:30.408
Your smell is worse.

01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:36.482
The smell of rotting fish!

01:10:38.158 --> 01:10:39.158
It's so disgusting.

01:10:39.693 --> 01:10:43.254
- Stop crying, Yeon-ahn.
- She says I smell.

01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:46.128
It's O.K.. Ignore her.
Come on out.

01:10:46.733 --> 01:10:49.031
Hey you! Hyo-shin!
What's your problem?

01:10:50.203 --> 01:10:55.505
You wanna play dirty? O.K.
So what does your mom do?

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:58.338
Fucking bitch! Go to hell!

01:11:01.181 --> 01:11:02.181
You go to hell!

01:11:10.824 --> 01:11:12.348
Hey, break it up!

01:11:15.362 --> 01:11:17.387
Are you alright? Hyo-shin!
Hyo-shin!

01:11:18.832 --> 01:11:20.857
Look what you've done!

01:11:22.969 --> 01:11:23.969
Are you O.K.?

01:11:24.771 --> 01:11:25.771
Can you walk?

01:11:26.106 --> 01:11:27.106
She must be faking it.

01:11:54.668 --> 01:11:55.668
Where have you been?

01:11:59.506 --> 01:12:00.506
I was running an errand.

01:12:01.575 --> 01:12:02.575
Liar!

01:12:05.045 --> 01:12:06.444
I was looking all over for you.

01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:11.641
Where else could I be but in school?

01:12:12.686 --> 01:12:13.686
What is it?

01:12:14.888 --> 01:12:17.152
I just wanted to know.
That way I feel safe.

01:12:19.059 --> 01:12:20.059
What about yesterday?

01:12:21.495 --> 01:12:22.495
I went to the movies.

01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:24.026
The movies? What theater

01:12:24.965 --> 01:12:25.965
What time? With whom?

01:12:26.533 --> 01:12:27.533
Come on!

01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:31.136
Why do you keep lying to me?

01:12:32.272 --> 01:12:33.272
I didn't see you.

01:12:34.274 --> 01:12:35.673
How couldn't you? Am I an bug?

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:37.202
How could you miss me?

01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:50.790
Hello?

01:13:16.116 --> 01:13:18.448
Where the hell is Shi-eun?

01:13:25.992 --> 01:13:29.291
Whenever you're not around,
I feel nervous.

01:13:31.898 --> 01:13:32.898
Then what shall we do?

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.580
Shall we glue ourselves
to each other?

01:13:38.004 --> 01:13:42.532
I feel like you've disappeared
when you're not with me.

01:13:45.245 --> 01:13:47.406
It's you who are more likely
to pull a stunt like that.

01:13:51.451 --> 01:13:54.852
That doesn't make me
insecure though.

01:13:58.124 --> 01:14:01.560
It's because I trust you.

01:14:03.697 --> 01:14:04.697
Liar

01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:08.067
How did you guess?

01:14:12.105 --> 01:14:14.596
If you can't trust me,
I'll prove it to you.

01:14:15.642 --> 01:14:16.666
Let's make it public.

01:14:19.613 --> 01:14:23.515
When? How?

01:14:23.617 --> 01:14:25.178
Yoo Shi-eun, Haven't you
heard the bell?

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:27.649
What're you doing in our class?

01:14:29.823 --> 01:14:30.944
I'm confiscating your diary.

01:14:31.791 --> 01:14:33.782
Practice running
if you have time for this.

01:14:35.395 --> 01:14:36.726
What's in this thing?

01:14:38.298 --> 01:14:42.496
It takes time to understand
another world

01:14:44.104 --> 01:14:45.128
Our promise is forever.

01:14:46.806 --> 01:14:47.806
Promise?

01:14:48.408 --> 01:14:49.408
Forever?

01:14:49.409 --> 01:14:50.409
You can't be serious!

01:14:52.045 --> 01:14:53.045
Let go!

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:54.880
Let go I said!

01:14:55.982 --> 01:14:56.982
Bitch!

01:15:11.398 --> 01:15:18.531
Dont you have anything better to do?
How dare you!

01:15:20.407 --> 01:15:21.407
Come back!

01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.208
Stop!

01:15:27.047 --> 01:15:28.047
Hey, you!

01:15:28.815 --> 01:15:29.815
You come back!

01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:29.933
Oh good God! It's disgusting!

01:16:36.816 --> 01:16:38.784
Hey! Break it up!

01:17:01.775 --> 01:17:04.300
What? Can't you see we're busy?

01:17:04.811 --> 01:17:11.410
Class is over. We need to pee!

01:17:25.565 --> 01:17:26.565
What's with her?

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:29.664
That's Min Hyo-shin.
I hate her guts.

01:17:39.813 --> 01:17:40.813
Stupid moron!

01:18:35.969 --> 01:18:38.062
You turned your face
at the sight of me.

01:18:38.238 --> 01:18:41.435
You turned on me..

01:18:51.584 --> 01:18:52.584
I'm sorry...

01:18:55.421 --> 01:18:56.421
About what?

01:19:01.227 --> 01:19:02.267
I wanted to give you milk.

01:19:05.698 --> 01:19:07.165
Just milk and I was going to leave

01:19:10.036 --> 01:19:11.117
I don't drink milk anymore.

01:19:14.674 --> 01:19:15.674
Give me the diary!

01:19:16.442 --> 01:19:17.442
- No!
- Let go!

01:19:19.646 --> 01:19:20.646
Give it back to me!

01:19:22.582 --> 01:19:23.708
Please, I want it back!

01:19:28.855 --> 01:19:30.186
- Please, don't!
- Get away!

01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:32.258
Please my diary Shi-eun!

01:20:13.633 --> 01:20:14.954
What do you mean it doesn't open?

01:20:15.735 --> 01:20:17.703
Look, it has to open!

01:20:19.339 --> 01:20:20.636
Shut up, get out of my way.

01:20:26.379 --> 01:20:27.379
Shit, it's stuck.

01:20:31.584 --> 01:20:33.142
Go through the back!

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.020
Shut up!

01:20:35.288 --> 01:20:36.288
Move!

01:20:37.357 --> 01:20:38.357
Hey, Ji-won.

01:20:39.492 --> 01:20:40.492
So it's you again.

01:20:41.494 --> 01:20:42.974
Trouble seems to be your middle name.

01:20:45.064 --> 01:20:46.064
How did you know?

01:20:47.033 --> 01:20:48.660
What are you doing?
Are you testing me?

01:20:49.736 --> 01:20:50.736
Hey, You flatty! Flatty!

01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:02.381
Let's go.

01:21:08.888 --> 01:21:09.946
What's this noise?

01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:11.789
I'll check the broadcasting room.

01:22:27.367 --> 01:22:31.098
- Are you O.K.?
- No, I feel sick.

01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:33.101
Some girls have seen Hyo-shin.
Is it true?

01:22:33.272 --> 01:22:34.637
- Shut up.
- Tell me where!

01:22:35.007 --> 01:22:37.100
Here and there. Out of nowhere.

01:22:37.443 --> 01:22:38.483
What the hell's happening?

01:23:18.317 --> 01:23:19.682
You feel better now, don't you?

01:23:22.622 --> 01:23:23.622
How about you?

01:23:53.753 --> 01:23:55.345
Hey, Give it a rest!

01:23:59.158 --> 01:24:01.251
Don't you know?
The contest has been cancelled.

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:04.870
We don't need to practice.

01:24:05.498 --> 01:24:07.762
What? Who says so?

01:24:09.802 --> 01:24:11.565
I know what you were up to today.

01:24:13.439 --> 01:24:17.000
You've been bullshitting all day.

01:24:19.178 --> 01:24:21.339
If you intend to sabotage
the contest, then just leave.

01:24:23.316 --> 01:24:26.444
You bullied Hyo-shin
when she was alive.

01:24:28.387 --> 01:24:30.321
Have you had any remorse
since she died?

01:24:31.057 --> 01:24:33.525
What's with the airs! Bitch!

01:24:35.161 --> 01:24:36.958
Shut the hell up!

01:24:39.198 --> 01:24:41.029
We're singing in the contest!

01:24:41.634 --> 01:24:44.068
Oh, Really? Then let's go
to the auditorium right now.

01:24:44.136 --> 01:24:46.229
The students are all
gathered there.

01:24:46.439 --> 01:24:47.159
Stop it. Yeon-ahn.

01:24:47.273 --> 01:24:48.365
If you really wanna
commemorate her,

01:24:48.441 --> 01:24:49.772
today's the day, isn't it?

01:24:50.643 --> 01:24:51.643
Come on. Let's go.

01:24:53.513 --> 01:24:57.677
You're jealous of the attention
we're showing to Hyo-shin?

01:24:58.050 --> 01:25:00.416
Yeah..Right! That must be it!

01:25:01.287 --> 01:25:02.287
Stop. Never mind her.

01:25:26.579 --> 01:25:28.274
Hey, who's playing the piano?

01:26:48.628 --> 01:26:49.628
Teacher!

01:26:50.429 --> 01:26:54.627
Are you alright?
Where's everybody?

01:26:56.002 --> 01:26:58.493
If you see anyone, make them go
back to their rooms. Got it?

01:27:01.407 --> 01:27:02.407
Hey, So Min-ah!

01:27:05.711 --> 01:27:06.792
What's wrong with everyone?

01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:07.377
I'm not sure.
But all the doors are locked.

01:27:07.446 --> 01:27:08.811
Something's inside the gym.

01:27:09.415 --> 01:27:14.045
- Are you alright?
- Hey, Min-ah, Ji-won

01:27:15.287 --> 01:27:17.380
- What's wrong?
- Wake up!

01:27:17.757 --> 01:27:19.349
- Hyo-shin it's Hyo-shin
- Hyo-shin?

01:27:20.993 --> 01:27:23.427
Come on! Hurry!

01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:25.930
Let me go!

01:27:32.271 --> 01:27:35.434
Hey! Don't go!

01:30:35.387 --> 01:30:36.649
Let's start over again.

01:30:37.389 --> 01:30:38.617
Not here in school.

01:30:39.758 --> 01:30:42.124
I told you no!
Everyone will see.

01:30:42.628 --> 01:30:43.628
Are you ashamed of me?

01:31:42.788 --> 01:31:43.846
Go back to last month?

01:31:44.823 --> 01:31:46.222
I'll do whatever you want me to.

01:31:46.926 --> 01:31:48.325
You mean nothing to me.

01:31:49.161 --> 01:31:50.287
I can even kill myself.

01:31:52.765 --> 01:31:53.765
I don't give a damn.

01:31:55.301 --> 01:31:56.341
I'm really ashamed of you!

01:32:09.148 --> 01:32:13.642
Hyo-shin you're so terrible.
Really terrible.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.311
I've never hated you before,

01:32:17.222 --> 01:32:19.087
but from now on,
I'll hate you forever.

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:22.060
Happy Birthday to you.

01:33:42.808 --> 01:33:43.808
Shi-eun

01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:49.945
Are you O.K.?

01:33:54.753 --> 01:33:58.211
Sorry, I lost your diary.

01:34:01.093 --> 01:34:04.028
Don't worry, we can always
write a new one.

01:35:26.311 --> 01:35:29.178
Happy Birthday to you,

01:35:30.215 --> 01:35:32.945
Happy Birthday to you,

01:35:33.886 --> 01:35:37.617
Happy Birthday dear Shi-eun,

01:35:38.257 --> 01:35:41.818
Happy Birthday to you.
