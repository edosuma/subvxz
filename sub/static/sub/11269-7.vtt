WEBVTT

00:01.383 --> 00:04.018
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.086 --> 00:05.670
Hey, everybody.

00:07.073 --> 00:08.306
So, what's the latest?

00:08.374 --> 00:10.158
Frasier passed out about 3:00.

00:10.225 --> 00:11.543
Aw! Poor guy.

00:11.544 --> 00:13.411
Yeah. For someone whose
wife is leaving him,

00:13.412 --> 00:17.048
he seems awfully upset.

00:17.116 --> 00:20.385
Oh, God! My head! Sam,

00:20.453 --> 00:22.087
uh... coffee, please.

00:22.154 --> 00:26.491
Oh, Carla, uh...
about last night...

00:26.559 --> 00:28.427
I was in pretty bad shape,
you know?

00:28.428 --> 00:30.828
I was drunk, and I was
carrying on about Lilith.

00:30.829 --> 00:34.532
And I have this
half-memory of you

00:34.600 --> 00:38.270
dragging me
into the office and cleaning me up,

00:38.337 --> 00:39.837
putting me on the couch,

00:39.905 --> 00:42.240
laying a blanket
over me and-and...

00:42.308 --> 00:44.476
and sitting with me
until I fell asleep.

00:44.543 --> 00:46.678
And, well, even
in my drunken stupor,

00:46.746 --> 00:50.148
I wanted to thank you for
your... your unexpected kindness. Thanks.

00:50.215 --> 00:51.983
Glad to help.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.267
Here's your coffee.

00:53.335 --> 00:55.403
Thank you, Sam.

00:55.471 --> 00:57.171
Geez!
What time is it?

00:57.239 --> 00:58.673
You know,

00:58.741 --> 01:00.959
I could have sworn
I had my Rolex on.

01:01.026 --> 01:05.080
FRASIER:
Hey, where's my class ring?

01:52.127 --> 01:55.296
Boy, I've never felt
so low in my life.

01:55.364 --> 01:59.767
Well, Doc, if it means anything
to ya, I'm here for ya.

01:59.835 --> 02:03.021
It doesn't, Cliff, but thanks.

02:03.088 --> 02:07.192
Boy, Dr. Sternin-Crane having
an affair with another guy.

02:07.259 --> 02:09.426
Mm, this reminds me

02:09.495 --> 02:11.963
of a terrible scandal
we had back in Hanover.

02:12.031 --> 02:14.466
Rocked the whole
town to its core.

02:14.534 --> 02:18.236
Mayor's wife ran off
with old Mr. Smithers.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.588
Oh, that's not
so scandalous, Woody.

02:20.656 --> 02:22.841
Well, Mr. Smithers was a goat.

02:25.193 --> 02:27.645
W-Woody, why... why
don't you take a break?

02:28.714 --> 02:30.148
Again?

02:30.216 --> 02:32.917
Man, this day is flying!

02:32.918 --> 02:35.270
You know what the most
painful thing about it is?

02:35.271 --> 02:36.637
I... I didn't
see it coming.

02:36.705 --> 02:38.073
Lilith had an affair.

02:38.107 --> 02:39.641
I had no idea.

02:39.709 --> 02:41.710
Now she's leaving me and...

02:41.777 --> 02:43.411
There were no signs.

02:43.479 --> 02:44.859
Do you know what I mean, Sam?

02:44.914 --> 02:46.664
Sam?

02:46.732 --> 02:47.866
I'm sorry.

02:47.933 --> 02:49.901
I'm still back
on Mr. Smithers.

02:50.422 --> 02:53.454
Now, Doc, maybe
there were signs,

02:53.455 --> 02:55.256
you were just
too blind to see them.

02:55.324 --> 02:57.391
Yeah, I mean, what
with Lilith, uh...

02:57.459 --> 03:00.528
spending every night late at
work for the last six months.

03:00.529 --> 03:02.196
You know, whenever the
two of you were together,

03:02.197 --> 03:03.431
you were just
bickering all the time.

03:03.432 --> 03:04.833
And, worst of all, you know,

03:04.834 --> 03:06.901
you spend all
your waking hours sitting in this bar.

03:06.902 --> 03:07.652
Cliffy, I don't think
he wants to...

03:07.653 --> 03:10.522
No, Sam, you know,
I want to hear this.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.722
Maybe it's time somebody

03:11.723 --> 03:14.259
did splash the cold water
of reality in my face.

03:14.326 --> 03:17.495
On the other hand, at least
I'm not a career-stagnant,

03:17.563 --> 03:20.633
middle-aged mama's boy with
little or no sexual experience.

03:20.666 --> 03:23.234
I know what you mean, Doc.

03:23.302 --> 03:26.871
We have a few of those
at work- very sad.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.227
I can't believe
she wants to leave me.

03:32.294 --> 03:34.395
I really blew it.

03:34.463 --> 03:37.265
Well, Fras, you know,
marriage is a very tricky thing.

03:37.333 --> 03:40.935
It takes a lot of work
and sacrifice and compromise

03:40.936 --> 03:43.237
from both parties
to keep it fresh and rewarding.

03:43.238 --> 03:45.173
How can you say that?

03:45.174 --> 03:48.009
You work less at your marriage
than anyone else in the world!

03:48.010 --> 03:50.694
I was hoping
the irony would cheer you up.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.333
Well, Doc, if you ask me,

03:55.334 --> 03:57.569
you're wasting your time
sitting around here

03:57.570 --> 03:59.036
feeling sorry for yourself,

03:59.037 --> 04:01.038
when you should be out there
trying to get her back.

04:01.039 --> 04:02.140
How do you suggest I do that?

04:02.141 --> 04:04.309
Get off your butt
and take charge.

04:04.376 --> 04:06.010
Be a caveman.

04:06.112 --> 04:07.278
A woman likes that.

04:07.346 --> 04:08.613
Caveman?

04:08.680 --> 04:11.116
Trust me-
Nick Tortelli...

04:11.183 --> 04:13.318
now there was a caveman.

04:13.385 --> 04:15.153
In fact, the next time you see

04:15.220 --> 04:18.623
one of those drawings of how
man evolved from the ape,

04:18.690 --> 04:21.625
look real closely
at that second guy.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.131
Thanks for the idea, Carla,

04:26.132 --> 04:28.065
but I hardly think
the primitive approach

04:28.066 --> 04:31.436
would work on a woman
as sophisticated as Lilith.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.421
Well, then why don't you
try the romantic route?

04:33.422 --> 04:36.057
You know, take her up to the
Cape for a romantic weekend

04:36.058 --> 04:37.692
and treat her the
way you used to.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.278
Oh, no, no, no-
Come on, Sam, with that bush-wa.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.780
You know, if you want
to keep a woman in your life,

04:42.781 --> 04:45.750
nothing beats the old-fashioned
fake heart attack.

04:48.754 --> 04:50.454
I beg your pardon?

04:50.522 --> 04:53.391
She goes for the door,
you go for your chest.

04:53.392 --> 04:54.692
I mean, nobody can walk out

04:54.693 --> 04:56.227
on somebody who's
having a coronary.

04:56.228 --> 04:58.163
It's foolproof.
I learned it from Ma.

04:58.230 --> 05:01.065
She uses that on you?

05:01.133 --> 05:02.617
Or I use it on her.

05:02.685 --> 05:04.375
It depends who's
trying to leave.

05:09.592 --> 05:11.058
Frasier...

05:14.062 --> 05:16.130
Well, look who's here.

05:16.131 --> 05:18.199
I suppose this is the
part where we fight

05:18.200 --> 05:20.568
over who gets to
keep our friends.

05:22.421 --> 05:23.971
No...

05:24.039 --> 05:26.557
Then why are you here?

05:26.558 --> 05:28.226
To humiliate me
again in public?

05:28.227 --> 05:29.727
Seems to be a theme you enjoy.

05:29.794 --> 05:31.512
No, I was worried about you.

05:31.580 --> 05:35.349
I brought you a shaving kit
and some clean clothes.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.619
You were worried about me?

05:37.620 --> 05:38.920
Then you're not leaving me?

05:38.921 --> 05:40.238
Oh, I'm still leaving you.

05:40.305 --> 05:42.173
Frasier, this is so...

05:42.241 --> 05:44.425
I'm sorry.

05:45.811 --> 05:48.680
I think we should have
this discussion in the office.

05:48.748 --> 05:51.649
WOODY:
Oh, no chance of that, Dr. Sternin-Crane.

05:51.717 --> 05:53.868
Sam's office
is his inner sanctum.

05:53.869 --> 05:56.204
The only person who gets
to use Sam's office is Sam.

05:56.205 --> 05:58.075
It's all right, Woody.
It's all right.

05:58.076 --> 06:00.191
Oh, well, maybe if Kelly
ever has an affair,

06:00.192 --> 06:02.893
I'll get to use
your precious office.

06:02.961 --> 06:05.596
Poor Fras, huh?

06:05.664 --> 06:07.398
What about Lilith?
Huh?

06:07.465 --> 06:09.867
She's probably just
trying to find herself.

06:09.935 --> 06:11.419
Oh, come off it, Becs.

06:11.487 --> 06:13.721
Nobody tries to find
themselves anymore.

06:13.722 --> 06:15.139
And, even when it was in style,

06:15.140 --> 06:18.059
it was just an excuse
for middle-aged people to quit work,

06:18.060 --> 06:21.262
ride around on Harleys,
and have sex with young people.

06:21.263 --> 06:22.913
Oh, is that right,
Miss Know-It-All?

06:22.914 --> 06:24.349
Well, it just so happens

06:24.350 --> 06:27.118
that my father once
left for six months to find himself.

06:27.119 --> 06:28.152
And when he came back,

06:28.153 --> 06:29.287
he was at peace with the world.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.388
You could see it in his eyes

06:30.389 --> 06:33.090
the second he came
roaring up the driveway.

06:33.158 --> 06:35.259
Well, here we are.

06:35.327 --> 06:37.195
Is this it?

06:37.262 --> 06:41.699
Should I, uh... call a lawyer,
initiate divorce proceedings?

06:41.767 --> 06:43.601
It's up to you.

06:43.602 --> 06:45.937
You're the one making all
the decisions, apparently.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.005
Frasier,
I do not want a divorce.

06:48.073 --> 06:49.641
I want a trial separation.

06:49.708 --> 06:52.042
Furthermore,
I'm going to be gone

06:52.111 --> 06:53.511
for a while, so I need to know

06:53.512 --> 06:55.012
that Frederick
is being taken care of

06:55.013 --> 06:56.614
in the best manner possible.

06:56.615 --> 06:58.816
It would be irresponsible
for me to take him

06:58.817 --> 07:00.734
from a comfortable
and familiar home

07:00.735 --> 07:02.503
where he feels stable
and secure.

07:02.571 --> 07:04.922
Therefore, I would like you

07:04.923 --> 07:07.558
to have sole custody for the
period of time that I'm gone.

07:07.559 --> 07:08.793
Just like that?

07:08.794 --> 07:09.761
You're not only
walking out on me,

07:09.762 --> 07:11.129
but on your own son as well.

07:11.196 --> 07:14.132
Oh, Frasier, you think this
is easy for me? It's not!

07:14.199 --> 07:17.101
Please just promise me
you'll take care of my son!

07:17.102 --> 07:18.636
Wouldn't have it any other way.

07:18.637 --> 07:21.856
Personally, I don't
want him growing up

07:21.924 --> 07:24.792
in your swinging
bachelorette pad,

07:24.860 --> 07:28.662
what with your
love beads, your hi-fi

07:28.730 --> 07:32.233
and your Dave Brubeck albums!

07:32.301 --> 07:34.852
Frasier, if you can't
get into the '90s,

07:34.853 --> 07:36.253
at least move into the '60s.

07:36.254 --> 07:38.022
Well, then where are
you going to live?

07:38.023 --> 07:39.991
All right, let me guess.
Don't tell me!

07:40.058 --> 07:43.027
You're going to move in with
your boyfriend, Dr. Pascal!

07:43.095 --> 07:45.563
That's right, Frasier, I am.

07:45.630 --> 07:48.349
What's so great about this
Pascal guy anyway, huh?

07:48.350 --> 07:50.051
I mean, the man
is obviously a crackpot.

07:50.052 --> 07:53.755
All he's noted for is inventing
this ridiculous bubble underground.

07:53.822 --> 07:56.056
It's called
an Eco-pod, Frasier.

07:56.124 --> 07:57.808
A self-contained

07:57.809 --> 07:59.460
subterranean environment
which will serve

07:59.461 --> 08:02.680
as a prototype
for an eventual space station.

08:02.747 --> 08:05.933
Similar to the Biosphere, only
on a much more ambitious scale.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.154
To be inhabited by moles
and gophers, no doubt.

08:10.222 --> 08:13.040
Yes, it will house a variety
of animal species.

08:13.108 --> 08:16.043
And, for the first year,
two human subjects as well.

08:16.044 --> 08:17.478
Oh, really?
And where in the world

08:17.479 --> 08:19.814
do you expect to find...
Oh, no!

08:21.800 --> 08:24.869
Yes, Frasier, I'm off
to live in the Eco-pod.

08:24.937 --> 08:28.639
Oh, no!

08:28.707 --> 08:30.474
It's a noble experiment.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.809
I'm a pioneer.

08:32.878 --> 08:35.948
The research we are going to do
is going to aid all of humanity.

08:35.981 --> 08:39.166
This is the stupidest day
I've ever had.

08:39.234 --> 08:41.519
It's anything but
stupid, Frasier.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.921
Dr. Pascal is a visionary.

08:43.988 --> 08:46.990
I'm proud to be associated
with him as we chart the future.

08:46.991 --> 08:49.660
Oh, this will be a big hit on
the cocktail party circuit.

08:49.661 --> 08:51.596
"Say, Fras, where's your
lovely wife this evening?"

08:51.597 --> 08:53.097
"Well, Bob,

08:53.164 --> 08:56.601
she's underneath the Earth's
crust with her boyfriend."

08:59.605 --> 09:01.339
"What's new with you?"

09:01.406 --> 09:03.307
I refuse to discuss
this any further.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.175
You're being irrational.

09:05.176 --> 09:07.177
No, wait, Lilith, wait.
Don't go, please.

09:07.178 --> 09:09.547
Look, I... I'm sorry.

09:09.615 --> 09:12.800
Please help me to understand
why you're doing this.

09:18.724 --> 09:22.326
Well, Frasier...

09:22.394 --> 09:25.329
ever since I was a little girl,

09:25.397 --> 09:29.667
I've led a very disciplined,
regimented life.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.519
But in the
back of my mind, I always had this

09:32.587 --> 09:35.206
nagging feeling
that something was missing.

09:35.274 --> 09:37.508
I tried to fill the void
with achievements...

09:37.576 --> 09:40.778
scientific awards,
marriage to a prominent man.

09:40.845 --> 09:44.965
But deep down inside,
I still felt empty.

09:45.033 --> 09:48.836
Then along came Googie.

09:48.904 --> 09:50.754
Googie?

09:50.822 --> 09:53.907
Dr. Pascal.

09:53.975 --> 09:56.176
He's a free thinker.
A radical.

09:56.244 --> 09:58.412
I never know
what he's going to do next.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.814
And when I'm with him,

09:59.815 --> 10:01.732
I don't know
what I'm going to do next.

10:01.733 --> 10:04.101
That's new for me, Frasier.

10:04.169 --> 10:08.106
I like it.

10:08.173 --> 10:10.358
I hope you understand.

10:10.426 --> 10:13.577
(sighing):
I suppose I do.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.982
You know, maybe
I haven't always listened.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.953
Maybe I haven't always known
the right thing to say or do.

10:22.020 --> 10:24.422
Just one thing
I want you to know.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.293
I wish you the very best.

10:29.361 --> 10:32.096
I adore you, and I always will.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.133
Thank you.

10:41.139 --> 10:43.507
Take good care of Frederick.

10:43.575 --> 10:45.376
And yourself.

10:48.013 --> 10:50.047
Good-bye, Frasier.

10:50.115 --> 10:53.017
Good-bye, my love.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.319
(gasping)
Oh! Oh, my God!

10:59.858 --> 11:02.526
I'm having a heart attack!

11:04.195 --> 11:07.281
Well, maybe not.

11:14.506 --> 11:16.573
I'm going now.

11:16.641 --> 11:18.309
I'd like to leave
a parting word.

11:18.377 --> 11:21.611
I want you to know that what
I'm doing is very difficult.

11:21.679 --> 11:23.714
It is not to hurt Frasier.

11:23.781 --> 11:26.550
It's to acknowledge the
fact that I'm changing.

11:26.617 --> 11:30.287
No one can go living year in and
year out without ever changing.

11:30.355 --> 11:31.956
It's impossible.

11:35.060 --> 11:38.328
Or at least it's very rare.

11:40.015 --> 11:41.999
Well, I'm off.

11:42.066 --> 11:43.934
I don't know what
the future holds.

11:44.002 --> 11:45.703
Whatever happens, I only hope

11:45.771 --> 11:47.971
I can realize my
full potential.

11:48.039 --> 11:50.508
To acquire things the
old Lilith never had.

11:50.575 --> 11:52.693
Like a body temperature?

11:55.831 --> 11:57.031
That's very good, Carla.

11:57.082 --> 11:59.367
Incidentally,

11:59.434 --> 12:01.451
I've taken your
little wisecracks

12:01.519 --> 12:04.021
for a few years now,
you hideous gargoyle,

12:04.022 --> 12:06.790
and if you ever open
that gateway to hell you call a mouth

12:06.791 --> 12:08.259
in my direction again,

12:08.260 --> 12:10.794
I'll snap off
your extremities like dead branches

12:10.795 --> 12:13.030
and feed them
to you at gunpoint.

12:15.216 --> 12:17.701
God! That felt good.

12:19.938 --> 12:21.405
Well...

12:21.473 --> 12:24.575
that was just plain rude.

12:34.586 --> 12:35.986
Oh, hey, Fras.

12:36.054 --> 12:37.354
How you doing, huh?

12:39.374 --> 12:41.541
Come on, talk to us-
we're your friends.

12:41.886 --> 12:45.930
Say something
to him, will ya? Like what?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.230
I don't know,
somethin' positive.

12:47.231 --> 12:48.766
Something to cheer him up.

12:50.234 --> 12:52.603
Frasier, say, have
you lost weight?

12:55.290 --> 12:57.825
What? That would
cheer me up.

13:01.546 --> 13:04.047
I appreciate your concern,
everyone, and...

13:04.115 --> 13:06.016
you can stop worrying.

13:06.084 --> 13:08.602
You see, I know exactly
how this is gonna go.

13:08.670 --> 13:12.472
After the shock wears off,
there will be some initial pain

13:12.473 --> 13:14.474
followed by resentment
and depression,

13:14.475 --> 13:16.794
and a lasting
sense of insecurity,

13:16.862 --> 13:20.080
as I ping-pong blame
between Lilith and myself.

13:21.349 --> 13:23.634
Throughout this process,
all I have to do is...

13:23.702 --> 13:28.639
keep telling myself that
everything is going to be okay.

13:28.707 --> 13:32.476
Well, the shock
seems to be wearing off.

13:32.544 --> 13:34.611
Here comes the pain.

13:36.948 --> 13:39.333
Oh, boy.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.836
Oh, mama, that's a big one!

13:42.904 --> 13:46.123
Frasier, can we
do anything for ya?

13:46.191 --> 13:48.058
Oh, no, Sam, no.

13:48.059 --> 13:49.860
If anyone
has the inner resources

13:49.861 --> 13:52.296
to deal with this,
it's Dr. Frasier Crane.

13:52.364 --> 13:53.730
Trust me.

13:53.798 --> 13:56.333
I know exactly
how to handle this.

13:59.271 --> 14:02.139
I'm gonna jump, Lilith!

14:10.816 --> 14:13.784
OFFICER (over bullhorn):
Attention, this is the police.

14:13.852 --> 14:17.504
Do not jump.
I repeat, do not jump.

14:17.572 --> 14:20.073
Whatever your problem is,
we can solve it.

14:20.141 --> 14:21.742
Just go back inside.

14:21.810 --> 14:25.545
I swear to God I'm gonna jump!

14:25.546 --> 14:27.898
Where's that shrink we use
in cases like this?

14:27.899 --> 14:28.966
You mean Frasier Crane?

14:28.967 --> 14:30.284
He's not answering his pager.

14:30.285 --> 14:31.902
Yeah, remind me
to put this in my report.

14:31.903 --> 14:33.537
That man'll never work
in this town again.

14:33.538 --> 14:36.256
Hey, you have
your whole life ahead of ya.

14:38.293 --> 14:39.843
Anything good on?

14:39.911 --> 14:43.480
Yeah, we got, uh, Oprah,
we got, uh... Quincy...

14:44.332 --> 14:46.817
Home Shopping Network...

14:46.885 --> 14:49.186
we got a guy on a ledge...

14:49.253 --> 14:51.121
we got Barnaby Jones...

14:51.122 --> 14:52.473
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Normie!

14:52.474 --> 14:53.614
Normie, go back, quick.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.512
Go back, go back,
go back- yeah, yeah.

14:55.577 --> 14:57.277
Oh, my God!

14:57.345 --> 15:00.314
Hey, that's that Quincy where
they buried the wrong guy!

15:00.381 --> 15:04.151
SAM: Hey, Normie, go back
to that guy-on-the-ledge stuff.

15:04.152 --> 15:05.486
Hey, that's just right outside.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.488
No wonder all these people
are in here.

15:07.555 --> 15:09.657
I wonder who the poor sap is.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.857
OFFICER:
Go back inside.

15:10.858 --> 15:14.461
FRASIER:
I swear to God I'm gonna jump!

15:14.529 --> 15:15.979
Oh, my God!
Wait, wait, wait.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.314
Sam, uh, you find Lilith,

15:17.382 --> 15:19.583
and Carla and I'll go
up and find Frasier.

15:19.584 --> 15:21.552
Come on, come on, Norm,
I'm going up there, too.

15:21.553 --> 15:22.586
Normie, come on, will ya?

15:22.587 --> 15:24.155
A buddy of ours
is on the ledge.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.090
He's about to jump
to his death- let's go!

15:26.091 --> 15:28.261
Geez, you're right-
I better go move my car.

15:34.132 --> 15:35.365
Aw...

15:37.368 --> 15:38.852
Frasier?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.654
Hey, uh, I'll take it.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.156
I'm a friend of his-
I think I can help.

15:43.157 --> 15:45.492
I've operated these before, sir.
It's all right.

15:45.493 --> 15:49.496
Frasier, it's me-
your friend, Cliff Clavin.

15:50.348 --> 15:51.765
Now pitching for Boston...

15:51.833 --> 15:53.066
Hey, come on, would ya?

15:53.067 --> 15:54.935
All right. Just kidding,
just kidding.

15:54.936 --> 15:57.004
Uh, Fras...

15:57.072 --> 16:00.174
look, buddy, uh, don't think
I don't know how you feel.

16:00.241 --> 16:03.277
Uh, it's not like
I haven't been there myself,

16:03.345 --> 16:05.462
you know, standing
high above the city

16:05.463 --> 16:07.164
with the wind
blowing through your hair,

16:07.165 --> 16:09.900
praying this time
you'll have the guts to do it.

16:09.968 --> 16:11.201
Give me that!

16:11.269 --> 16:13.921
Frasier, Frasier,
don't listen to him, man.

16:13.988 --> 16:16.156
So it didn't work out
with Lilith.

16:16.224 --> 16:18.592
You know? What's the big deal?
That's okay.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.027
What about your friends?

16:20.094 --> 16:22.263
What about me?
I care for ya.

16:22.330 --> 16:23.764
Hell, I love ya, man!

16:23.832 --> 16:25.332
CROWD:
Aw...

16:26.500 --> 16:28.601
Yeah, I said it.

16:28.669 --> 16:30.638
Look, a guy can love another guy

16:30.705 --> 16:33.407
without being the kind of guy
who loves other guys.

16:33.475 --> 16:36.460
You knew what I was saying,
didn't you, Fras?

16:36.527 --> 16:38.795
You didn't think that I meant...

16:38.863 --> 16:40.630
the other thing, did ya?

16:42.517 --> 16:43.597
Hold on a second, Fras.

16:43.651 --> 16:45.386
Take that. Talk to him.

16:45.453 --> 16:47.787
No, it's all right.

16:47.788 --> 16:49.256
I'm his wife.
Don't aggravate him.

16:49.257 --> 16:50.637
I'm the reason he's up there.

16:50.658 --> 16:53.093
He's very unstable.

16:54.278 --> 16:58.348
Frasier, you're making
a big fool of yourself.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.734
Don't leave me, Lilith!

17:00.802 --> 17:03.237
It's too late, Frasier-
I've made up my mind.

17:03.304 --> 17:05.588
I'm gonna jump!

17:05.656 --> 17:08.209
Lie to him- tell him
you'll go back with him.

17:08.276 --> 17:11.311
Tell him to go inside.

17:11.378 --> 17:14.548
I can't lie to you, Frasier.
It's over.

17:14.855 --> 17:17.751
(crowd murmurs) Come on, lady!

17:17.752 --> 17:21.021
What were we supposed to do,
go on living the charade?

17:21.089 --> 17:23.089
Sure, we had
an amazing sex life,

17:23.156 --> 17:25.342
but a relationship
is more than that.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.660
I felt the confines
of our marriage

17:27.728 --> 17:29.662
were not allowing me to grow.

17:31.482 --> 17:35.068
Surely some of you women
know what I'm talking about.

17:35.136 --> 17:37.804
VARIOUS WOMEN:
Right on! Right on! Yay!

17:37.872 --> 17:42.142
Why don't you tell them
about your affair?!

17:42.210 --> 17:44.712
(crowd groans)

17:44.779 --> 17:48.682
Well, I was in
a very vulnerable state, and...

17:48.750 --> 17:50.317
Frasier, this is ridiculous.

17:50.385 --> 17:52.319
I'm coming upstairs.

17:56.691 --> 18:00.010
Fras, a-about
what I was saying earlier.

18:00.078 --> 18:04.014
You know, there are all kinds
of different kinds of love.

18:05.883 --> 18:07.517
(gasps):
Frasier!

18:07.585 --> 18:10.153
You stay back!
Okay, okay.

18:10.221 --> 18:11.805
Rebecca, I found him!

18:11.872 --> 18:13.307
Frasier...

18:13.374 --> 18:14.624
Don't come near me!

18:14.625 --> 18:16.227
I-I won't come
near you, Frasier.

18:16.228 --> 18:18.295
Please, please,
just step inside.

18:18.363 --> 18:21.982
Oh, Rebecca, go back to Cheers
and leave me alone.

18:21.983 --> 18:23.433
No, Frasier, we're
your friends.

18:23.434 --> 18:26.204
Don't jump- you have lots of
friends who care about you.

18:26.205 --> 18:29.073
NORM (over bullhorn): Frasier,
listen to me- this is Norm Peterson.

18:29.074 --> 18:31.108
I want you to listen
very carefully.

18:31.176 --> 18:34.278
You left about a half a mug
of beer on the bar.

18:34.345 --> 18:36.496
You don't suppose
that I could, maybe...

18:36.564 --> 18:37.730
Help yourself!

18:37.798 --> 18:39.199
Thank you.

18:39.267 --> 18:41.034
Frasier...

18:41.035 --> 18:42.886
Lilith, don't come near me-
I swear I'll jump!

18:42.887 --> 18:44.054
Would you excuse us, please?

18:44.055 --> 18:45.789
I'd like to speak
with my husband.

18:45.857 --> 18:48.558
Okay... But before I go,
I want to say one thing.

18:48.626 --> 18:51.095
Go ahead and jump, you coward!

18:51.162 --> 18:52.246
Take the easy way out!

18:52.313 --> 18:53.913
Go ahead and end it all!

18:53.981 --> 18:57.067
(whispers):
Wow, that was reverse psychology, right?

18:57.135 --> 19:00.203
What's reverse psychology?

19:03.408 --> 19:04.674
Frasier...

19:04.742 --> 19:07.344
I refuse to indulge
in this little game

19:07.412 --> 19:09.546
of emotional blackmail
any longer.

19:09.614 --> 19:12.565
You and I both know you have
no intention of jumping.

19:12.633 --> 19:14.334
I know you better than that.

19:14.402 --> 19:15.969
No, you don't, Lilith.

19:16.037 --> 19:18.972
I'm gonna jump,
because I can't go on living

19:19.040 --> 19:21.141
knowing that
you love someone else.

19:25.647 --> 19:28.148
Very well, Frasier.

19:28.216 --> 19:29.483
You win.

19:31.553 --> 19:33.303
I won't leave you.

19:33.370 --> 19:35.038
Really?

19:35.106 --> 19:36.190
Really.

19:36.257 --> 19:38.192
Now, come inside.

19:43.231 --> 19:45.899
You mean, you're not
just saying that?

19:45.966 --> 19:47.734
No, I'm not just saying it.

19:47.802 --> 19:49.136
I won't leave you.

19:49.204 --> 19:52.405
I may be unhappy for
the rest of my days, but...

19:52.473 --> 19:55.042
I will honour my obligations
as your wife.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.826
Baby, you're the greatest!

20:01.149 --> 20:03.283
(sighs)

20:03.351 --> 20:04.951
Oh, go on, Lilith...

20:05.019 --> 20:06.620
get out of here.

20:06.688 --> 20:08.955
What do you mean?

20:09.023 --> 20:11.675
I can't be happy
knowing that you're not.

20:11.742 --> 20:13.360
(window sliding closed)

20:14.662 --> 20:16.196
(sighs)

20:16.264 --> 20:18.549
Thank you, Frasier.

20:18.616 --> 20:20.701
Well, thank you for...

20:20.768 --> 20:22.736
getting me off the ledge.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.921
I was gonna pretend to faint

20:24.989 --> 20:27.674
and fall back in,
but this worked a lot better.

20:41.906 --> 20:43.807
How you doing?

20:43.875 --> 20:46.943
Oh, I'll be
okay, Sam. Thanks.

20:47.011 --> 20:50.296
You want anything,
you let me know.

20:50.364 --> 20:52.799
Well, you know,
there is, uh, one thing.

20:52.867 --> 20:56.936
Could you, uh, take the bullhorn
away from Cliff and Norm?

20:56.937 --> 21:00.090
CLIFF (on bullhorn): All right, McGerk,
you'll never take me alive! Ha-ha!

21:00.091 --> 21:02.225
Come on, come on,
it's my turn! Come on!

21:02.226 --> 21:05.228
Attention, K-Mart shoppers!
Attention, K-Mart shoppers!

21:05.229 --> 21:08.398
Whoa, whoa! Guys, guys, whoa.

21:08.465 --> 21:10.551
Hey, come on!

21:12.404 --> 21:15.839
Frasier, I just wanted
to say good-bye.

21:15.907 --> 21:17.257
Dr. Pascal and I

21:17.325 --> 21:19.709
are leaving
for the desert tonight.

21:19.777 --> 21:21.578
Are you all right?

21:21.645 --> 21:23.880
No... but I will be.

21:23.948 --> 21:27.233
I said good-bye to Frederick
this afternoon.

21:27.301 --> 21:28.936
He loves the thought of Mommy

21:29.003 --> 21:31.154
going off to live
in a big bubble.

21:31.222 --> 21:33.840
I'm sure this will be
a special memory for him

21:33.908 --> 21:36.376
that he will relive
over and over again

21:36.444 --> 21:39.446
in the years
of his psychoanalysis.

21:39.514 --> 21:41.031
(door opens)

21:41.099 --> 21:42.315
Lilith, you ready?

21:42.383 --> 21:45.151
Googie, I thought
you were going to wait outside.

21:45.152 --> 21:48.355
Before we leave there's
something I have to say to your husband.

21:48.356 --> 21:50.356
Uh...

21:50.424 --> 21:53.009
I-I-I know this is
an awkward moment, Doctor,

21:53.077 --> 21:54.545
but I have to tell you.

21:54.612 --> 21:57.280
I was pulling up
in front of the bar just now,

21:57.348 --> 22:01.084
and I seem to have
dinged your BMW.

22:02.936 --> 22:05.405
Oh. Of course you did.

22:07.191 --> 22:08.291
Well, we're off.

22:08.359 --> 22:10.693
We've got to be going.

22:10.761 --> 22:12.362
Good-bye, Frasier.

22:12.430 --> 22:13.830
Good-bye, Lilith.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.832
Oh, there's just...

22:15.899 --> 22:18.084
there's something
I'd like to say.

22:18.085 --> 22:20.120
I know you've got a
rough year ahead of you.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.721
You're in for some rocky times.

22:21.789 --> 22:25.024
I-I'm sure you'll experience
some very painful moments,

22:25.092 --> 22:27.344
and when you do,

22:27.411 --> 22:30.564
I'd like you to feel free
to call on me for...

22:30.631 --> 22:32.699
sympathy and understanding.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.701
Thank you, Frasier.

22:34.769 --> 22:37.003
I was talking to Googie.
