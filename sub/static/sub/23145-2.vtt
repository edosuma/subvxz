00:00.325 --> 00:02.935
Welcome back to
"Swords and Knives for Wives"

00:03.003 --> 00:05.003
on the Langley Home Shopping Network.

00:05.272 --> 00:07.471
Next up, we've got
these kitchen scissors.

00:07.942 --> 00:10.142
What? "That's not a knife," you say?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.878
Correct again, my home beauties.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.262
Two knives.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.999
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:17.001 --> 00:20.402
- Ohhhh-aaaaaaah...
- Ohhhh-aaaaaaah...

00:20.404 --> 00:23.872
Now for a visit from an
old friend of the show.

00:23.874 --> 00:28.277
Let's give a warm
welcome to Mr. Lincoln!

00:30.014 --> 00:32.347
Penny for your thoughts, Mr. President?

00:32.348 --> 00:34.216
You say you want a shave?

00:34.218 --> 00:36.685
That makes cents.

00:39.490 --> 00:43.158
While I show you how sharp
these scissors are, a joke.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.361
A llama and a raccoon walk
into a barbershop and...

00:46.363 --> 00:47.962
Oh, we're done.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.698
He never gets to the punch line.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.299
His scissors are too sharp.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.236
I got to have those sharp-ass scissors!

00:54.238 --> 00:56.639
My producer says we're sold out.

01:29.740 --> 01:31.748
_

01:33.744 --> 01:35.678
Roger, what are you doing here?

01:35.680 --> 01:39.281
Just, uh, trying to return
these gently used sausages.

01:39.283 --> 01:42.685
Okay, but I'm meeting my dear friend

01:42.687 --> 01:44.819
"Gina Lavetti" here,

01:44.821 --> 01:47.289
so you going to go change
into her, or what?

01:47.291 --> 01:48.490
That's weird.

01:48.492 --> 01:49.958
I heard you and Gina were in a fight.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.203
What? Why? Did she say something?

01:52.238 --> 01:53.502
Oh, uh, no.

01:53.898 --> 01:56.565
What? Y-you know what?
It's not my place.

01:56.567 --> 01:57.966
Please don't tell Gina I said anything.

01:57.968 --> 02:00.002
Don't tell Gina what?

02:01.706 --> 02:02.771
Oh, shit.

02:02.773 --> 02:03.972
Don't look at him for help.

02:03.974 --> 02:05.374
This is between you and me.

02:05.376 --> 02:06.709
I'm still pissed at you.

02:06.711 --> 02:08.110
For what? What did I do?

02:08.112 --> 02:09.978
You're the one who's an hour late.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.313
At least I showed up,

02:11.315 --> 02:14.249
unlike you to make candle store opening.

02:14.251 --> 02:17.052
Hey, uh, I think I'm going to bounce.

02:18.616 --> 02:21.123
I'm sorry I didn't make the opening,

02:21.125 --> 02:23.458
but I can come by the
candle shop tomorrow.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.727
Can't. Failed.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.795
Turns out taco smell
is not something people

02:26.797 --> 02:28.597
are looking for in a candle.

02:28.599 --> 02:31.266
Gina, can we try to move past this?

02:31.268 --> 02:33.668
I forgot my sausages.

02:33.670 --> 02:35.313
Why would I want to move past this?

02:35.413 --> 02:37.129
It's not like it's the
first thing you've done.

02:37.164 --> 02:37.940
What do you mean?

02:37.942 --> 02:39.942
Well, for starters,
you kept liking Dan's

02:39.944 --> 02:41.744
Instagram after he dumped me.

02:41.746 --> 02:43.412
You didn't reach out
when my turtle died.

02:43.414 --> 02:46.014
You didn't even congratulate
me when I got my Prius,

02:46.016 --> 02:47.750
which I know you know I have.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.684
You're a bad friend.
You're not supportive.

02:49.686 --> 02:52.020
You're a toxic person. Goodbye.

02:52.022 --> 02:54.356
Gina, stop! You're right.

02:54.358 --> 02:56.091
I've been a bad friend,

02:56.093 --> 02:58.761
but I promise I'll be more supportive.

02:58.763 --> 03:00.629
Can you give me another chance?

03:00.631 --> 03:02.297
Well, I don't know.

03:02.299 --> 03:03.966
But if you want to tag along,

03:03.968 --> 03:07.102
I'm about to go get some
jeans at the sexy jean store.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.139
Really? But that place
is for hotties with b...

03:12.251 --> 03:14.909
Let's get Gina some jeans!

03:14.911 --> 03:16.979
There's nothing even close, Francine.

03:16.981 --> 03:20.048
Uh, ma'am, you can't bring
your goat into this store.

03:20.050 --> 03:22.918
What? No. This is my friend, Gina.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.454
It is eating the jeans.

03:25.456 --> 03:27.255
I eat when I'm nervous!

03:29.726 --> 03:31.927
Oh, I'm sure they look great.

03:31.929 --> 03:33.863
Give us a show.

03:38.068 --> 03:39.635
Ta-da.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.244
I am going to kill myself.

03:49.246 --> 03:50.779
Why does nobody make jeans

03:50.781 --> 03:52.848
for regular women like me?

03:52.850 --> 03:55.183
Ding dong. Light-bulb moment.

03:55.185 --> 03:58.754
Maybe I'll make my own jeans.

03:59.923 --> 04:01.923
Are you in support of that idea?

04:01.925 --> 04:05.527
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You should totally do that.

04:05.529 --> 04:06.862
They won't only be for me.

04:06.864 --> 04:09.331
They'll also be for women just like me,

04:09.333 --> 04:12.600
complicated women with
complicated bodies,

04:12.602 --> 04:13.936
but I don't know a lot

04:13.938 --> 04:16.338
or even a single thing
about making jeans.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.605
You'll learn!

04:17.607 --> 04:21.142
And this time,
I'll be there every step of the way.

04:21.144 --> 04:22.344
Even when I go to the bathroom?

04:22.346 --> 04:23.611
Even then.

04:23.613 --> 04:24.746
What if I got a rotten tummy

04:24.748 --> 04:27.015
from eating too many asparagus stalks?

04:27.017 --> 04:29.217
Sure! It happens.

04:29.219 --> 04:30.552
Okay.

04:30.554 --> 04:32.220
I'm starting to trust you.

04:32.222 --> 04:34.222
And now for the final step.

04:34.224 --> 04:37.826
Figuring out how to make
jeans and making them.

04:39.497 --> 04:43.231
Hmm, jeans.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:52.642 --> 04:55.243
Jeans.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.630
_

05:05.323 --> 05:09.591
Ugh, these renegade eyebrows
of mine, so bushy.

05:09.593 --> 05:12.194
I feel like all I ever do
is pluck, pluck, pluck.

05:12.196 --> 05:14.262
I would kill for your eyebrows.

05:14.264 --> 05:15.931
Look at my little nothings.

05:15.933 --> 05:18.466
I wouldn't wish these thin-y
minis on my worst enemy.

05:18.468 --> 05:21.670
Oh, please.
I'd trade you in a heartbeat.

05:33.150 --> 05:36.752
- I wish I had Dad's eyebrows.
- I wish I had Steve's eyebrows.

05:52.970 --> 05:55.704
Now that you know everything
about making jeans,

05:55.706 --> 05:57.439
I guess it's time to dig in.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.241
Nope. I'm going to wait for a sign.

05:59.243 --> 06:02.178
Oh, maybe it will come
in the form of a dream.

06:04.892 --> 06:07.249
Oh? Did I hear a little tippy-toe?

06:07.251 --> 06:09.117
- Sorry?
- Am I just supposed to

06:09.119 --> 06:11.787
drift off to sleep totally unsupported?

06:11.789 --> 06:15.291
- Do you want me to stay?
- Yes.

06:19.263 --> 06:20.930
Gina.

06:23.201 --> 06:24.266
Jeans?

06:24.268 --> 06:29.271
- It's time to make me, Gina.
- Okay, bye.

06:29.273 --> 06:30.672
Jeans!

06:30.674 --> 06:34.410
You need this,
but you got to call right now.

06:35.536 --> 06:36.878
I had the dream.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.346
I made the jeans!

06:38.348 --> 06:39.547
I'm so proud of you!

06:39.549 --> 06:41.417
I already know where
I'm going to sell them,

06:41.419 --> 06:44.753
on an all-the-way unzipped
He-Man sleeping bag

06:44.755 --> 06:45.821
in front of the bus depot.

06:45.823 --> 06:48.490
What?! These jeans are great!

06:48.492 --> 06:51.827
You should sell them on TV like Tuttle.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.963
My friend has a product to sell.

06:54.965 --> 06:57.032
My name? Francine.

06:57.034 --> 06:59.301
Sagittarius.

06:59.303 --> 07:00.769
Red.

07:00.771 --> 07:04.773
Uh... bi-curious.

07:04.775 --> 07:06.542
I got us a meeting!

07:14.833 --> 07:16.785
- You have my eyebrows!
- You have my eyebrows!

07:16.787 --> 07:18.520
Someone is coming. Quick, hide!

07:21.693 --> 07:23.325
Oh, my God.
Wh... what are we going to do?

07:23.327 --> 07:25.327
I can't go to school like this.

07:25.329 --> 07:26.862
And I can't go to work like this.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.797
We'll have to switch places.

07:29.399 --> 07:32.201
This is already working.

07:35.681 --> 07:38.140
These are very good jeans.

07:38.142 --> 07:40.208
And they got a good flap to them.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.544
It's my special proprietary blend.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.813
- What's your revenue?
- Zero.

07:44.815 --> 07:47.215
How about your customer
acquisition costs?

07:47.217 --> 07:49.084
- What's that?
- Your ROI?

07:49.086 --> 07:51.153
- Pass.
- Look. You have a great product,

07:51.155 --> 07:54.222
but jeans are a hearty outdoor pant,

07:54.224 --> 07:57.092
and our viewers are gentle indoor women.

07:57.094 --> 08:00.896
I see. Well, thank you for your time.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.630
Listen, gentlemen.

08:02.632 --> 08:04.232
I am one of your viewers,

08:04.234 --> 08:07.102
and I am not some gentle indoor woman.

08:07.104 --> 08:09.705
I walked to the grocery store once.

08:09.707 --> 08:11.173
Did I fall in the gutter?

08:11.175 --> 08:14.376
Yes, and I wish I was wearing jeans

08:14.378 --> 08:18.246
because the mud splashed all
the way up to my underwear.

08:18.248 --> 08:23.519
So in conclusion,
my underwear is brown from a puddle,

08:23.521 --> 08:29.791
and my friend deserves a
chance to sell her jeans on TV!

08:29.793 --> 08:30.993
Who are you?

08:31.508 --> 08:33.794
She's my rock.

08:33.797 --> 08:35.597
Ladies, I'm convinced.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.599
You've got yourselves a show.

08:38.802 --> 08:41.937
Now, let me tell you why
<i>my</i> underwear is brown.

08:47.311 --> 08:50.245
Ladies, are you tired, stressed out?

08:50.247 --> 08:53.716
Do you have swollen ankles,
sad eyes, bitch face?

08:53.718 --> 08:55.450
Well, gross!

08:55.452 --> 08:59.121
Wow. That guy knows how
to sell pancake mix.

08:59.123 --> 09:02.391
Francine!
Oh, and you must be Gina Lavetti!

09:02.393 --> 09:05.060
Welcome to the network. Are you excited?

09:05.062 --> 09:06.328
More like nervous.

09:06.330 --> 09:09.398
Don't worry about it, kid.
You're gonna do great.

09:11.868 --> 09:13.468
Ms. Lavetti, you're on next.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.604
- This is too much pressure.
- Listen to me.

09:15.606 --> 09:19.808
I'll be right here in
your ear the whole time.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.011
You're on in three, two...

09:26.883 --> 09:28.483
Talk about the jeans.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.352
- Jeans.
- Good!

09:30.354 --> 09:33.155
Now show them who you are.

09:33.157 --> 09:37.226
I'm Gina Lavetti, and this is me.

09:39.430 --> 09:42.497
I've got the body of a rabbit
and the soul of a lion.

09:42.499 --> 09:46.368
I'm a 58-year-old woman
who's loved, lost, and lived,

09:46.370 --> 09:47.770
and I'm not done yet.

09:47.772 --> 09:51.906
I am embarking on a new journey,
a jean journey.

09:51.908 --> 09:54.243
So if you don't have
toothpick legs like the women

09:54.245 --> 09:56.245
in magazines, pick up the phone.

09:56.247 --> 10:00.182
My jeans are built for women
who are built like me...

10:00.184 --> 10:02.585
normal.

10:02.587 --> 10:05.520
This space-age fabric
is stretchy and tight.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.721
You'll look so sexy,

10:06.723 --> 10:08.723
you'll never want to
take these jeans off.

10:08.725 --> 10:10.592
Gina, you have a customer.

10:10.594 --> 10:12.060
We're going to put her on the air.

10:12.062 --> 10:13.528
Oh, I didn't really expect

10:13.530 --> 10:16.198
to be on the air,
but I do need some jeans.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.667
You do? You love my jeans?

10:18.669 --> 10:20.002
Oh, they're going to change your life

10:20.004 --> 10:22.137
like you've changed mine.

10:22.139 --> 10:23.738
Who else wants jeans?

10:24.263 --> 10:26.074
That's a wrap!

10:26.076 --> 10:27.676
Can you believe it, Franny?

10:27.678 --> 10:31.880
We sold a pair of jeans to
every woman who called in...

10:31.882 --> 10:33.215
Two!

10:33.217 --> 10:35.550
I'm on top of the world!

10:35.552 --> 10:37.219
You would sell way more
if they didn't give you

10:37.221 --> 10:39.354
the 5:00 a.m. time slot.

10:39.356 --> 10:41.289
- Why?
- It's too late.

10:41.291 --> 10:44.159
With the sunrise,
people's hopes come back.

10:44.161 --> 10:47.630
They stop trying to buy away
their sadness, but don't worry.

10:47.632 --> 10:50.165
I'm going to work day and
night to get your jeans

10:50.167 --> 10:52.301
in front of as many
eyeballs are possible.

10:52.303 --> 10:55.103
Cool, cool, Francine. Well,
I'm going to head on over to Arby's

10:55.105 --> 10:57.372
and do my kegels.

11:00.377 --> 11:01.844
<i>Como se dice!</i>

11:01.846 --> 11:03.912
Wake up in Spanish?

11:03.914 --> 11:06.581
Como se dice jeans?

11:06.583 --> 11:10.619
Como se dice normal women?

11:12.056 --> 11:14.256
We need her to glow.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.124
You're making her look gray!

11:16.126 --> 11:18.227
She <i>is</i> gray.

11:18.529 --> 11:19.928
Aah!

11:21.265 --> 11:23.798
I'm so sorry. I just meant to fake it!

11:24.254 --> 11:26.669
But let's fix the lighting, okay?

11:28.739 --> 11:30.539
I don't know what's come
over you, Langley,

11:30.541 --> 11:33.315
but we sold out again!
And to reiterate,

11:33.378 --> 11:36.945
earlier I referred to that
prank caller as a maggot.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.248
That's maggot with an "M."

11:41.485 --> 11:44.086
Big presentations today?

11:44.088 --> 11:45.554
I hope that was yesterday.

11:45.556 --> 11:47.356
- Steve.
- Uh, yeah?

11:47.358 --> 11:49.624
You look like you've
gained 100 pounds overnight

11:49.626 --> 11:50.893
and dyed your hair.

11:50.895 --> 11:53.295
If it weren't for those
big bushy eyebrows,

11:53.297 --> 11:54.697
I wouldn't have recognized you.

11:54.699 --> 11:55.764
And you know the rules.

11:55.766 --> 11:57.299
Bushiest eyebrows go first.

11:57.921 --> 12:00.402
So you're right after Ross.

12:01.491 --> 12:03.405
Aaah!

12:04.575 --> 12:06.709
So you jump out of this helicopter

12:06.711 --> 12:08.243
and kill the terrorists!

12:08.634 --> 12:11.113
Then we'll tell
each other detailed stories

12:11.115 --> 12:13.048
to prove that we're not virgins!

12:14.051 --> 12:16.385
Now, Stan, you know the rules.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.787
Wispiest eyebrows jump first!

12:22.223 --> 12:26.629
Just kidding. Thickest pubes go first!

12:29.332 --> 12:31.866
Hey, boss, wanted
to talk to you about getting

12:31.868 --> 12:34.002
Gina Lavetti a better time slot.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.304
We want 3:00 a.m.

12:35.306 --> 12:36.405
Tuttle's at 3:00 a.m.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.540
Tuttle is old potatoes.

12:38.542 --> 12:40.342
Gina is hot potato.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.877
Tuttle's our boy. I'm not moving him.

12:42.879 --> 12:44.279
Your boy, huh?

12:44.281 --> 12:46.415
I look around, and I see me and Gina

12:46.417 --> 12:47.682
are the only women here.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.284
- So?
- So...

12:49.286 --> 12:54.089
I'm starting to think this
is nothing but a boy's club.

12:54.091 --> 12:56.425
Tss-cha-cha...

12:56.427 --> 12:59.361
- Ch-ch-ch...
- Bam!

12:59.363 --> 13:00.895
What's happening?

13:00.897 --> 13:02.497
♪ Boy's club ♪

13:02.499 --> 13:04.233
♪ It's a boy's club ♪

13:04.235 --> 13:07.035
♪ We're the boys ♪

13:07.037 --> 13:10.372
- Pssh.
- Aah.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.441
♪ We're the boys, yeah! ♪

13:12.443 --> 13:14.843
♪ It's a boy's club ♪

13:14.845 --> 13:16.911
Pow!

13:16.913 --> 13:18.113
I was right.

13:18.115 --> 13:20.048
♪ Yeah ♪

13:20.050 --> 13:21.650
The president is back!

13:21.652 --> 13:24.920
And he wants to be corkscrewed again.

13:24.922 --> 13:26.054
Move Tuttle?

13:26.056 --> 13:27.389
He's a star!

13:30.727 --> 13:32.461
This... this is embarrassing.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.464
This, uh, this... this never happens.

13:36.297 --> 13:38.133
Damn it!

13:38.135 --> 13:40.936
Ow! These damn scissors suck!

13:47.077 --> 13:49.478
They fired him. They fired Tuttle.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.879
You're welcome.

13:50.881 --> 13:52.481
Oh, my God. You were the one

13:52.483 --> 13:53.616
who dulled his scissors.

13:53.618 --> 13:55.150
Damn it. That would have been

13:55.152 --> 13:56.952
way cheaper than buying a diamond penny.

13:56.954 --> 14:00.088
Tuttle was a dear friend, a mentor.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.224
Why would you do this?

14:02.226 --> 14:03.892
What are you talking about?

14:03.894 --> 14:05.560
I got you 3:00 a.m.

14:05.562 --> 14:07.229
I never wanted 3:00 a.m.

14:07.231 --> 14:09.364
I didn't even want to be on TV.

14:09.366 --> 14:11.700
All I wanted was a supportive friend,

14:11.702 --> 14:14.102
but you're poison, so get out of my face

14:14.104 --> 14:16.104
and take your friendship bracelet back.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.439
I didn't give you that.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.009
And why doesn't that surprise me?

14:24.315 --> 14:26.047
Welcome to "Gina's Jeans."

14:26.049 --> 14:29.184
I'm Gina,
and this is my co-host, Tuttle.

14:29.186 --> 14:31.720
She hired Tuttle back?!

14:31.722 --> 14:33.722
How could she do this to you?

14:33.724 --> 14:36.858
She's gone absolutely insane!

14:36.860 --> 14:39.128
I can't believe how stretchy they are

14:39.130 --> 14:41.463
and yet so tight.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.799
It's my proprietary blend.

14:43.801 --> 14:45.200
You can walk in these jeans.

14:45.202 --> 14:47.803
You can shop in them,
and you can be an older woman

14:47.805 --> 14:50.972
who is taking part in
this world in them.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.007
Let's take a call.

14:52.009 --> 14:53.742
Love the jeans, love you.

14:53.744 --> 14:55.276
There's just one thing.

14:55.278 --> 14:57.947
I took the jeans off last night,
and when I woke up,

14:57.949 --> 14:59.080
I was wearing them.

14:59.082 --> 15:02.684
Sweet dream jeans
are made of these. Next caller.

15:02.686 --> 15:05.754
She put her jeans on in her sleep?

15:05.756 --> 15:07.689
- That seems weird.
- Yeah.

15:07.691 --> 15:09.491
That Gina is a real bitch.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.360
Hey, Gina, love the jeans.

15:11.362 --> 15:13.162
My ass has never looked better.

15:13.164 --> 15:17.632
One thing, though,
the jeans occupy my every thought

15:17.634 --> 15:19.434
and also, uh...

15:19.436 --> 15:20.769
control them.

15:20.771 --> 15:24.239
Wait, the jeans
are controlling her thoughts?

15:24.241 --> 15:26.908
- Something's up.
- Oh, I'll say something is up.

15:26.910 --> 15:29.845
You got her the best time
slot on the most successful

15:29.847 --> 15:33.114
local home shopping network...
all she ever wanted.

15:33.116 --> 15:35.784
Well, actually,
she just wanted to sell her jeans

15:35.786 --> 15:38.053
off a sleeping bag at the bus depot.

15:38.055 --> 15:40.856
We should be the ones
banging Tuttle, not her.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.791
Woman #3: Anyway,
I met my friend for brunch,

15:42.793 --> 15:45.394
and our jeans compelled
us to steal a car

15:45.396 --> 15:46.862
and drive to the coordinates.

15:46.864 --> 15:48.463
- The coordinates?
- Yep.

15:48.465 --> 15:51.266
Uh-huh. What's at the coordinates?

15:51.268 --> 15:54.803
Oh, just... our destiny.

15:57.474 --> 16:00.141
Okay. Next caller.

16:00.143 --> 16:03.078
Tell me you're having a nice,
normal time with my jeans.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.279
Oh, I am.

16:04.281 --> 16:07.749
I wore them to a summer party,
and it was a smash!

16:07.751 --> 16:11.286
Also, my jeans would be so
mad at me if I didn't say...

16:11.288 --> 16:14.756
10, 21, 16, 47.

16:14.758 --> 16:18.159
Okay, those are definitely coordinates.

16:18.161 --> 16:19.828
Keep selling.

16:21.832 --> 16:23.298
I'm going to the studio.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.966
Yeah. Hit it with your car.

16:24.968 --> 16:26.702
I ain't gonna tell nobody.

16:26.704 --> 16:29.371
Klaus, you moron, Gina is my friend.

16:29.373 --> 16:30.572
I got to go help her.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.307
Now she's your friend?

16:32.309 --> 16:36.511
Francine, I am working my
ass off to be on your side,

16:36.513 --> 16:38.380
but you've got me spinning in circles!

16:38.382 --> 16:41.917
Okay, cards on the table.
I will do anything to be liked.

16:41.919 --> 16:45.454
I will say any words.
I am loyal to no person or idea.

16:45.456 --> 16:49.991
I just need the slightest
shred of human connection.

16:49.993 --> 16:51.126
Can you help me?

16:51.128 --> 16:52.794
Gina is in trouble.

16:53.701 --> 16:56.265
Gina <i>is</i> Roger!

16:58.869 --> 17:01.470
Gina, I love the jeans.

17:01.472 --> 17:02.872
She's gonna mention the coordinates.

17:02.874 --> 17:04.806
I can wear them with a T-shirt.

17:04.808 --> 17:06.275
I can wear them with a blazer.

17:06.277 --> 17:07.541
That is true.

17:07.544 --> 17:09.611
I get a lot of compliments on them.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.813
That's wonderful!
I thought you were gonna say...

17:11.815 --> 17:14.750
10, 21, 16, 47.

17:14.752 --> 17:16.685
We got to stop this!

17:20.424 --> 17:21.490
Where you going?

17:21.492 --> 17:22.758
I don't know. Probably...

17:22.760 --> 17:26.161
10, 21, 16, 47.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.637
- Hayley!
- Mom, help me!

17:35.639 --> 17:37.172
- Get in.
- I can't.

17:37.174 --> 17:39.508
These jeans are taking me somewhere.

17:39.510 --> 17:40.709
I see.

17:40.711 --> 17:45.981
Well, I'm going to 10, 21, 16, 47

17:45.983 --> 17:49.118
if that's anywhere near
where you're going.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.252
Wow, this is crazy.

17:51.254 --> 17:52.988
That would be great.

18:00.197 --> 18:03.332
- How was work?
- I had no idea what it was like

18:03.334 --> 18:04.600
to have your eyebrows.

18:04.602 --> 18:06.268
And I had no idea what it was like

18:06.270 --> 18:07.404
to have <i>your</i> eyebrows.

18:07.505 --> 18:09.338
So I was too light for your parachute

18:09.340 --> 18:11.940
and drifted 17 miles from
the mission drop zone.

18:11.942 --> 18:13.742
Well, that's probably safer.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.677
For me, yeah, but I was supposed

18:15.679 --> 18:18.614
to be covering Johnson, so he's dead.

18:18.616 --> 18:20.616
Then we're even because
I kind of messed up

18:20.618 --> 18:22.845
- your school presentation.
- Oh, that's okay.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.620
They barely count towards your grade.

18:24.622 --> 18:26.087
Oh, good. That's great.

18:26.089 --> 18:28.690
I panicked and showed them my dick.

18:35.630 --> 18:38.968
Gina, I'm so sorry. You were right.

18:38.970 --> 18:41.036
I was being a bad friend.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.972
That's great, Francine,
but we're a little past

18:42.974 --> 18:45.240
that now being in the middle
of what I can only assume

18:45.242 --> 18:46.642
is a jeans death march.

18:46.644 --> 18:48.243
What the hell is going on?

18:48.245 --> 18:51.180
Well, my proprietary blend was cotton,

18:51.182 --> 18:54.449
and a little piece of my
spaceship's seat belt,

18:54.451 --> 18:57.252
which is sentient and self-replicating,

18:57.254 --> 18:59.254
which I initially thought
might be a problem,

18:59.256 --> 19:01.122
but then the fabric told me it wasn't

19:01.124 --> 19:02.724
and to stop asking questions.

19:03.761 --> 19:06.662
Everybody, get out of those jeans!

19:06.664 --> 19:08.998
But the jeans make us beautiful!

19:09.000 --> 19:11.733
You don't need jeans to be beautiful.

19:11.735 --> 19:14.536
Easy for you to say, you skinny bitch!

19:14.538 --> 19:15.671
You have to do something.

19:15.673 --> 19:17.072
They won't listen to me.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.208
What? The only reason
they're in those jeans

19:19.210 --> 19:21.543
is because you inspired them.

19:21.545 --> 19:23.879
Now you've got to get
them to take them off.

19:23.881 --> 19:25.747
The jeans have all the power.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.883
Because <i>you</i> gave it to them!

19:27.885 --> 19:29.084
Now take it back.

19:30.138 --> 19:32.487
Women of Langley, I used to think jeans

19:32.489 --> 19:34.489
were the most important
thing in the world,

19:34.491 --> 19:37.292
that they made me worthy,
beautiful, lovable.

19:38.947 --> 19:43.164
Am I still now all these
things even without the jeans?

19:43.166 --> 19:46.768
Sure, but you're still
wearing them a little bit.

19:49.373 --> 19:51.306
I should have taken my shoes off first.

19:51.308 --> 19:55.577
I didn't realize it,
but I gave my power away

19:55.579 --> 19:59.381
to the jeans, something that
we are women should never do,

19:59.383 --> 20:02.183
because when we give
jeans too much power,

20:02.185 --> 20:03.919
they end up controlling us.

20:03.921 --> 20:06.588
Really go for it, Francine.
You can't hurt me.

20:06.590 --> 20:08.323
Aaaah, it hurts so much!

20:08.325 --> 20:09.725
You're breaking my feet!

20:11.568 --> 20:13.128
Find a supportive friend,

20:13.130 --> 20:16.665
and get out of those damn jeans.

20:16.667 --> 20:17.867
They're doing it!

20:17.869 --> 20:19.935
They're free of the jeans!

20:29.280 --> 20:32.347
It's just like the dream,
how it all started.

20:32.349 --> 20:35.817
Jeans, do you have a message for us?

20:35.819 --> 20:39.288
Confidence is sexy.

20:41.532 --> 20:45.627
That giant talking pair of
jeans is worth millions!

20:45.629 --> 20:47.930
Get it, boys!

20:51.835 --> 20:53.435
Sorry, jeans.

20:53.437 --> 20:56.171
You belong to the boy's club now.

20:56.173 --> 20:58.440
Jesus Christ!

20:58.442 --> 21:00.709
Have a great night!
