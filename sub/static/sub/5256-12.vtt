I can go there,

09:48.655 --> 09:52.557
Let's, uh, maybe pull back

09:52.559 --> 09:55.560
on the money-asking
situation.

09:55.562 --> 09:58.930
We also think you're
stealing money,

09:58.932 --> 10:01.232
so watch your back.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.834
He's like, Ah!

10:02.836 --> 10:04.636
[bleep] you, man!

10:04.638 --> 10:05.870
Fine!

10:05.872 --> 10:08.073
I'll go get it done.

10:08.075 --> 10:12.477
And so after he bails,
they're like,

10:12.479 --> 10:15.013
Let's kill him.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.881
And everyone's on board.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.851
But Lansky steps up,
and he's like,

10:19.853 --> 10:23.221
Let's not kill this guy

10:23.223 --> 10:26.057
and see how it all
turns out

10:26.059 --> 10:27.826
after the grand opening.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.028
And they're like,
All right, fine.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.696
That's your boy, so...

10:31.698 --> 10:36.001
He saved his friend twice
so far in this story.

10:36.003 --> 10:36.668
- Right.

10:36.670 --> 10:40.672
- They have the opening
December 26, 1946.

10:40.674 --> 10:44.909
But the hotel room construction
is still not done.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.845
People couldn't stay there.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.046
Bugsy's like,

10:48.048 --> 10:50.015
Everybody listen up!

10:50.017 --> 10:53.618
Now, I got planes
full of movie stars

10:53.620 --> 10:54.619
coming here tonight,

10:54.621 --> 10:59.624
so everything's gonna
get more glitzy and glamour-y

10:59.626 --> 11:02.794
than you could
even understand.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.662
You won't even--

11:03.664 --> 11:05.030
what are you talking about?

11:05.032 --> 11:05.830
What?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.298
Wait-wait-wait-wait.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.466
What?

11:08.468 --> 11:11.202
Oh, the planes
are grounded?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.637
It's [bleep] raining.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.606
So the planes are grounded.

11:14.608 --> 11:18.009
He can't all of his
fancy buddies come there

11:18.011 --> 11:19.010
for the opening.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.012
They lose 300 grand.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.849
So it's a bust all around.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.051
All the mobsters, they're like,

11:26.053 --> 11:27.152
What the [bleep]
is this [bleep]?

11:27.154 --> 11:29.921
Like, we're already
kind of pissed at you.

11:29.923 --> 11:34.459
Bugsy decides to close
the Flamingo down,

11:34.461 --> 11:37.095
finish the construction.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.198
So Benjamin Siegel...

11:40.200 --> 11:43.201
[laughing]

11:43.203 --> 11:46.504
[laughter]

11:47.373 --> 11:49.641
- Okay, so--
- All right, all right.

11:49.643 --> 11:53.578
- I'm ten times redder
than I was when we started.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.180
- You're ten times what?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.381
- Redder.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.485
So, in March, he re-opens.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.287
It starts doing okay.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.823
It seems like things
might be all right.

12:04.825 --> 12:08.026
Siegel goes to the mob guys,
and he's like,

12:08.028 --> 12:12.397
Hey, it's a profit-turner,

12:12.399 --> 12:13.965
positive situation.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.667
That's great
it's doing fine now,

12:15.669 --> 12:20.605
but pay us the money back
that we put into this.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.842
He's like, I can't
start paying you now,

12:23.844 --> 12:26.010
but we'll get it together.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.045
You know, whatever.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.781
He bails, and they were like,

12:29.783 --> 12:31.616
Unanimous vote!

12:31.618 --> 12:35.086
We're gonna kill this guy Ben

12:35.088 --> 12:36.688
that we call Bugsy,

12:36.690 --> 12:38.957
'cause he's a pain in the ass.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.925
And Lansky was like,

12:40.927 --> 12:42.861
Guys...

12:42.863 --> 12:47.499
I have no argument this time.

12:47.501 --> 12:50.735
It's a bummer.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.103
All right.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.705
Go ahead.

12:53.707 --> 12:56.174
Kill my buddy.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.276
I can't defend him anymore.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.079
- So Bugsy goes back to L.A.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.747
Bugsy's sitting there
reading the paper

13:02.749 --> 13:05.683
at, like, you know,
2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

13:05.685 --> 13:09.287
And nine bullets
come raining through the window.

13:09.289 --> 13:13.191
Two hit him, but one
blew his left eye ball

13:13.193 --> 13:14.793
right out of his head.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.562
Like, [bleep] ten minutes later,

13:17.564 --> 13:21.800
Lansky's associates
walk into the Flamingo,

13:21.802 --> 13:22.567
and they're like,

13:22.569 --> 13:26.070
Hey, we got this covered now.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.173
Bugsy's dead.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.241
Lansky and the Flamingo

13:30.243 --> 13:34.479
start making money
hand over fist.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.148
Mobsters from
all over the country

13:37.150 --> 13:39.117
flood into Las Vegas.

13:39.119 --> 13:43.988
And that's the story
of the Vegas strip.

13:43.990 --> 13:48.860
What happens in Vegas
sometimes follows you home,

13:48.862 --> 13:53.398
and it gets your eye ball
shot out of your head.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.400
- That's a good moral.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.868
- [laughing]

13:56.870 --> 13:58.636
Right.

14:03.542 --> 14:06.277
- Here's to
the Civil Rights Movement.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.179
- Amen.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.214
Jim Crow,
I heard you.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.415
- No, I'm not drinking to--

14:10.417 --> 14:12.784
You almost made me drink
to Jim Crow.

14:12.786 --> 14:13.852
[laughter]

14:13.854 --> 14:15.687
- No, do it again,
do it again, sorry.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.490
- Tried to sneak Jim Crow in
at the end.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.426
Hello.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.662
I'm Paul F. Tompkins.

14:24.664 --> 14:25.730
And today we're going to talk

14:25.732 --> 14:32.937
about the Moulin Rouge Casino
in Las Vegas.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.105
- Cheers.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.540
- At the time,

14:35.542 --> 14:38.276
like every--most city,

14:38.278 --> 14:41.446
Jim Crow laws
are in full effect!

14:41.448 --> 14:42.380
Somebody like Nat "King" Cole,

14:42.382 --> 14:45.383
He would do a show, and then
he would want to go inside

14:45.385 --> 14:46.351
with a friend of his.

14:46.353 --> 14:50.321
It's like, Oh, we can't
let you in here.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.725
You know you're
a black dude, right?

14:53.727 --> 14:54.459
It's insane.

14:54.461 --> 14:58.062
Like, it's insane
white people stuff.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.230
Then comes these guys.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.332
They say, Let's make a casino

15:01.334 --> 15:03.101
that black people can come to.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.435
It's called the Moulin Rouge.

15:04.437 --> 15:10.141
One of the investors
is boxing great Joe Louis.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.477
He's gonna be, like,
the public face

15:12.479 --> 15:14.145
of the Moulin Rouge.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.280
So, like, he's--

15:15.282 --> 15:17.615
Every once in a while,
the press checks in with him.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.718
Joe Louis is like,
We're doing a nationwide search

15:20.720 --> 15:27.125
for all of these
African-American, uh...

15:27.127 --> 15:29.227
entertainers, uh...

15:29.229 --> 15:31.429
dealers, um, chefs.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.599
Black people are gonna be,
like, in the front of the house.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.735
You're gonna see black people
when you walk in there.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.570
Like, really hyping it up.

15:39.572 --> 15:40.939
The Moulin Rouge opens.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.775
There are lines
around the block,

15:43.777 --> 15:45.076
people waiting to get in.

15:45.078 --> 15:48.012
And they say,
Oh, this is a new thing.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.681
An integrated casino,

15:49.683 --> 15:51.182
I've never heard
of such a thing,

15:51.184 --> 15:52.417
because I'm a racist

15:52.419 --> 15:54.786
from the time in which I live.

15:54.788 --> 15:55.520
Joe Louis is there.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.689
He's greeting everybody,
Hi, come on in.

15:57.691 --> 15:59.624
Come into the Moulin Rouge.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.092
It's French-themed.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.493
I'm dressed as a cowboy.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.828
Why?
Who knows?

16:03.830 --> 16:07.065
All these people,
tons of people.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.333
Everybody's excited.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.534
People are loving it.

16:09.536 --> 16:13.638
A 9-year-old Gregory Hines
is tap-dancing.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.374
They have this thing
called the Tropi Can Can.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.677
Joe Louis,
at the end of the show, says,

16:19.679 --> 16:24.048
We have--this is not just
the opening of a casino.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.617
We have made history
here tonight.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.988
"Life" magazine
does a story on it.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.790
After that, white celebrities
are showing up.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.994
It's, like, Frank Sinatra
with Louis Armstrong.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.397
It's Billie Holiday
with Judy Garland.

16:39.399 --> 16:42.700
Nat "King" Cole
and Dean Martin.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.003
Everybody has a good time.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.337
Everybody!

16:46.339 --> 16:47.338
Jack Benny!

16:47.340 --> 16:50.908
Who--who thought Jack Benny

16:50.910 --> 16:53.244
would have a good time there?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.346
[hiccup-laughs]

16:55.348 --> 16:59.183
Look, I may be--hiccup.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.720
- [laughing]

17:02.722 --> 17:05.490
- They're all having
a [bleep] great time.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.924
Cary Grant says
to Frank Sinatra,

17:06.926 --> 17:12.764
Hey, why are you, like--
this is a good thing, right?

17:12.766 --> 17:14.532
Like, we have fun, right?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.000
And Frank Sinatra says,

17:16.002 --> 17:17.735
Absolutely, we do.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.904
We have a great time.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.073
[hiccups]

17:22.075 --> 17:24.342
[hiccups]

17:24.344 --> 17:26.644
[hiccups]

17:26.646 --> 17:29.447
[hiccups]

17:33.052 --> 17:34.886
[hiccups]

17:38.757 --> 17:42.326
So the other casinos...

17:42.328 --> 17:47.799
they're like, It's weird
that a lot of people

17:47.801 --> 17:51.002
don't care about racism,

17:51.004 --> 17:52.770
and they're just going ahead

17:52.772 --> 17:55.673
and having fun
at the Moulin Rouge.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.177
What can we do now?

17:59.179 --> 18:01.979
So, like, the casinos,

18:01.981 --> 18:05.650
they say, Look, if you want
to sell liquor to us,

18:05.652 --> 18:09.687
you don't sell liquor
to the Moulin Rouge anymore.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.022
Then the Sahara, same thing.

18:11.024 --> 18:14.058
The Sahara says,
We will not buy food from you

18:14.060 --> 18:17.128
if you give food
to the Moulin Rouge.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.796
So, then, after 3 1/2 months,

18:18.798 --> 18:24.635
the Moulin Rouge mysteriously
has its liker--

18:24.637 --> 18:26.370
liquor suspended.

18:26.372 --> 18:31.109
I mean liquor license suspended.

18:31.111 --> 18:34.045
There's--it's not hard
to figure out,

18:34.047 --> 18:35.780
if you do the math yourself.

18:35.782 --> 18:42.286
A month later,
and the Moulin Rouge is closed.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.790
It was closed and toesed, man.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.725
Closed and toesed.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.260
[laughing]

18:49.262 --> 18:50.895
[snorts]

18:50.897 --> 18:53.664
The expression everyone knows:

18:53.666 --> 18:56.400
"closed and toesed."

19:04.409 --> 19:06.144
- What is going on, guys?

19:06.146 --> 19:07.078
Come on.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.079
- Nothing.

19:08.081 --> 19:09.480
- [laughs]

19:09.482 --> 19:10.047
Nothing.

19:10.049 --> 19:13.217
- I just want you
to wrap up the story.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.819
- [sighs]

19:14.821 --> 19:19.190
So the black folks that had been
hired to work there,

19:19.192 --> 19:22.860
of course they can't get jobs
anywhere else on the strip.

19:22.862 --> 19:26.330
Las Vegas is [bleep] up.

19:26.332 --> 19:30.368
Five years after
the Moulin Rouge has closed,

19:30.370 --> 19:35.506
the NAACP, the mafia,
the local government,

19:35.508 --> 19:36.507
they all get together,

19:36.509 --> 19:39.610
and they meet inside
the closes--

19:39.612 --> 19:40.511
[laughs]

19:40.513 --> 19:47.318
And they meet inside
the closed Lu-mon Rouge.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.288
No, every word is wrong.

19:50.290 --> 19:54.125
So the agreement
they sign that day

19:54.127 --> 19:56.594
is the Moulin Rouge Agreement,

19:56.596 --> 20:02.700
and this says that there's
no such thing as segregation

20:02.702 --> 20:06.170
anymore in hotels in Las Vegas.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.172
It's an historic thing.

20:08.174 --> 20:12.877
The Moulin Rouge,
it was a fun party time.

20:12.879 --> 20:17.481
Who-gives-a-[bleep] atmosphere.

20:17.483 --> 20:22.720
You know, you got to...

20:22.722 --> 20:24.822
You got to have people--

20:24.824 --> 20:26.357
Hmm.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.027
You got to have people--

20:30.029 --> 20:34.332
put a show on for the people.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.036
You got to do that.

21:13.405 --> 21:16.807
[both shouting]

21:17.876 --> 21:20.478
- Vegas, bro.
- Right.
