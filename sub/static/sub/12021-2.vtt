18:22.618 --> 18:27.321
CONTROL, OVERTURNED, AND BROKE

18:27.356 --> 18:29.757
IN TWO.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.767
>> [bleep]

18:44.773 --> 18:46.340
GOT A TANKER ON ITS SIDE,

18:46.375 --> 18:49.143
DENTED, ROLLED.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.245
I DON'T--IT'S BAD.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.780
THE ROAD IS OBVIOUSLY DANGEROUS.

18:52.848 --> 18:53.948
YOU GOT A TRUCK SITTING HERE

18:54.016 --> 18:55.383
WITH A TANKER IN THE DITCH.

18:55.417 --> 18:56.884
I MEAN, IF IT THAT DOESN'T

18:56.919 --> 18:58.119
EXPLAIN IT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT

18:58.153 --> 19:00.955
I CAN SAY TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

19:01.023 --> 19:02.290
>> narrator: ALL IT TOOK WAS

19:02.324 --> 19:04.292
A MOMENT'S LAPSE IN THE DRIVER'S

19:04.326 --> 19:05.393
CONCENTRATION.

19:05.427 --> 19:07.295
THE TRUCK DRIFTED RIGHT, AND ITS

19:07.329 --> 19:08.763
FRONT TIRE GOT CAUGHT IN THE

19:08.797 --> 19:11.199
SOFT SNOW, PULLING THE ENTIRE

19:11.233 --> 19:13.034
RIG OFF THE ROAD.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.335
THE FIFTH WHEEL, WHICH CONNECTS

19:14.403 --> 19:15.837
THE TRAILER TO THE TRUCK,

19:15.871 --> 19:16.971
SNAPPED OFF.

19:17.005 --> 19:18.606
THE TANKER SEPARATED FROM THE

19:18.640 --> 19:21.142
RIG AND 9,000 TONS OF DIESEL

19:21.176 --> 19:24.946
FUEL ROLLED DOWN THE EMBANKMENT.

19:25.013 --> 19:27.048
TRUCKING LEGEND KEITH MITCHELL

19:27.082 --> 19:28.749
HAD RUN THE DALTON FOR OVER

19:28.784 --> 19:30.785
20 YEARS WITHOUT A SINGLE

19:30.819 --> 19:32.153
ACCIDENT.

19:32.221 --> 19:34.488
IN A SPLIT SECOND, THIS VETERAN

19:34.523 --> 19:36.858
TRUCKER LOST HIS PERFECT RECORD

19:36.925 --> 19:39.393
AND VERY NEARLY HIS LIFE.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.494
>> THE FIFTH WHEEL JUST RIPPED

19:40.562 --> 19:41.462
RIGHT OFF THE FRAME OF THE

19:41.496 --> 19:43.097
TRUCK, AND THAT'S WHEN THE

19:43.131 --> 19:44.232
TANKER ROLLED OVER AND DOWN

19:44.299 --> 19:44.966
THE BANK.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.767
OTHERWISE MY TRUCK WOULD BE DOWN

19:46.835 --> 19:49.103
IN THE BANK AGAINST THE TREES

19:49.137 --> 19:50.404
RIGHT NOW.

19:50.472 --> 19:52.139
THAT FIFTH WHEEL BREAKING OFF

19:52.174 --> 19:53.307
MY TRUCK LIKE THAT PROBABLY

19:53.342 --> 19:54.775
SAVED MY LIFE.

19:54.843 --> 19:56.143
>> narrator: KEITH WAS LUCKY TO

19:56.178 --> 19:57.879
SURVIVE, BUT THE TANKER'S

19:57.946 --> 20:00.214
HEADING FOR THE JUNKYARD.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.750
NOW THE CARLILE HAZMAT TEAM IS

20:02.784 --> 20:05.119
ON THE JOB, RACING TO PREVENT

20:05.153 --> 20:07.021
A FUEL SPILL THAT COULD TURN

20:07.055 --> 20:09.290
INTO AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER.

20:11.426 --> 20:12.593
>> HOOKING UP THE HOSES SO THAT

20:12.628 --> 20:14.962
WE CAN PUMP THE TANKER OFF.

20:15.030 --> 20:16.297
>> COULD BE LAYING ON A BOULDER

20:16.365 --> 20:17.565
OR SOMETHING DOWN THERE, SO WE

20:17.599 --> 20:18.499
DON'T WANT TO MOVE IT UNTIL WE

20:18.567 --> 20:19.567
CAN GET MOST OF THE WEIGHT

20:19.601 --> 20:20.768
OUT OF IT, 'CAUSE IT COULD--

20:20.802 --> 20:22.370
COULD DO MORE DAMAGE TRYING TO

20:22.404 --> 20:24.205
MOVE IT THAN BY LEAVING IT

20:24.273 --> 20:25.373
THERE.

20:25.407 --> 20:26.674
>> narrator: IF IT CAN HAPPEN TO

20:26.708 --> 20:29.310
A SEASONED VETERAN, NEW DRIVERS

20:29.344 --> 20:32.747
LIKE GREG ARE SERIOUSLY AT RISK.

20:32.781 --> 20:34.115
>> HIS ATTENTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN

20:34.182 --> 20:35.483
OFF THE ROAD FOR TWO SECONDS.

20:35.517 --> 20:39.921
THAT'S ALL IT TOOK.

20:39.955 --> 20:43.124
THIS COULDA EASILY BEEN ME.

20:43.191 --> 20:44.225
[sighs]

20:44.259 --> 20:45.660
>> narrator: AS DANGEROUS AS IT

20:45.694 --> 20:48.095
IS TODAY, IT WAS EVEN WORSE

20:48.130 --> 20:50.464
IN THE 1970s WHEN THE DALTON

20:50.499 --> 20:52.133
HAD A SINISTER NICKNAME.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.401
>> THE DALTON USED TO BE KNOWN

20:53.435 --> 20:54.769
BY TRUCKERS AS THE KAMIKAZE

20:54.836 --> 20:55.770
TRAIL.

20:55.804 --> 20:57.104
THE CRAZY DRIVING CONDITIONS,

20:57.139 --> 20:58.105
PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE TAKING

20:58.140 --> 20:59.307
THEIR LIVES INTO THEIR HANDS

20:59.374 --> 21:00.308
WHEN THEY WENT OUT ONTO THAT

21:00.375 --> 21:01.008
ROAD.

21:01.043 --> 21:02.109
A LOT OF THEM WERE HAULING

21:02.144 --> 21:03.844
80-FOOT SECTIONS OF PIPE.

21:03.879 --> 21:05.046
AND TRYING TO KEEP THAT THING

21:05.080 --> 21:06.480
STRAIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY WAS ONE

21:06.548 --> 21:07.581
OF THE HARDEST THINGS THEY EVER

21:07.616 --> 21:09.450
TRIED TO DO AS A TRUCK DRIVER.

21:09.484 --> 21:10.952
>> narrator: THE KAMIKAZE TRAIL

21:11.019 --> 21:13.120
HAS FADED INTO HISTORY.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.488
WHAT HASN'T CHANGED IS THE

21:14.556 --> 21:16.857
FREIGHT--THE LONG, UNSTABLE,

21:16.925 --> 21:18.592
PROJECTILE-LIKE SECTIONS OF

21:18.660 --> 21:21.395
PIPE, JUST LIKE HUGH ROWLAND'S

21:21.463 --> 21:23.364
FIRST LOAD OF THE SEASON.

21:23.398 --> 21:24.298
>> IT'S LONG PIPE.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.399
IT'S CALLED LONG PIPE.

21:25.467 --> 21:26.467
THE HARDEST PART IS JUST MAKING

21:26.501 --> 21:27.668
SURE IT DOESN'T SHIFT ON YOU,

21:27.703 --> 21:29.170
AND PIPE EITHER COMES FORWARD

21:29.204 --> 21:30.771
TOWARDS THE CABIN OR OFF THE

21:30.839 --> 21:32.039
BACK END.

21:32.107 --> 21:33.040
READY TO GET UP THE ROAD.

21:33.075 --> 21:37.578
I'M OUTTA HERE.

21:37.612 --> 21:38.913
GET AS MANY LOADS AS I CAN

21:38.947 --> 21:40.648
POSSIBLY GET, AND THAT'S HOW

21:40.682 --> 21:42.483
I MAKE MY PAYCHECK, SO THAT'S

21:42.551 --> 21:46.754
WHAT I'M RUNNING WITH.

21:46.822 --> 21:49.457
[horn honks]

21:49.491 --> 21:50.491
>> narrator: ONLY A FEW MILES

21:50.559 --> 21:52.893
OUT...

21:52.928 --> 21:53.928
>> THAT FOUR-WHEELER BEHIND ME

21:53.996 --> 21:54.829
HAS A LOAD OF PIPE.

21:54.896 --> 21:55.930
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND GO BY ME

21:55.964 --> 21:56.897
IF YOU WANT.

21:56.932 --> 21:58.265
>> ALL RIGHTY, THANKS.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.300
>> narrator: HUGH GETS A

21:59.368 --> 22:01.268
REMINDER OF JUST HOW DANGEROUS

22:01.303 --> 22:07.541
THE ALASKAN ROAD CAN BE.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.809
>> WHOOPS. LOOK AT THAT.

22:08.844 --> 22:09.377
WHOA!

22:09.444 --> 22:10.378
>> [on radio] THAT WAS CLOSE!

22:10.445 --> 22:11.479
MY FRONT TIRE JUST STARTED TO

22:11.513 --> 22:13.381
GET SUCKED IN.

22:13.448 --> 22:14.582
>> narrator: AS HE PASSED HUGH,

22:14.649 --> 22:16.450
THE PICKUP DRIVER SLIPPED

22:16.485 --> 22:18.119
SIDEWAYS ON THE ICE AND CLIPPED

22:18.186 --> 22:21.889
THE SNOW BANK.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.395
>> NO, YOU DON'T NEED THAT, NO.

22:27.462 --> 22:28.462
HE [bleep] NEAR LOST IT

22:28.530 --> 22:29.463
COMPLETELY.

22:29.531 --> 22:30.731
HE JUST--HE JUST BARELY GOT HER

22:30.766 --> 22:33.200
BACK STRAIGHTENED OUT.

22:33.235 --> 22:34.835
AND DO--AND THERE'S NO [bleep]

22:34.903 --> 22:36.303
WAY I'D HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP.

22:36.371 --> 22:37.538
HE'D HAVE BEEN A [bleep] DEAD

22:37.572 --> 22:41.208
DUCK.

22:41.243 --> 22:42.176
>> narrator: HUGH DODGED A

22:42.210 --> 22:42.910
BULLET.

22:42.978 --> 22:44.912
AS HE HITS THE DALTON, HE BEARS

22:44.980 --> 22:48.382
DOWN ON THE ROAD AND HIS RIVAL.

22:48.417 --> 22:49.817
>> ONCE I PASS ALEX, HE NEVER

22:49.851 --> 22:50.651
CATCHES UP.

22:50.685 --> 22:51.652
SAME EVERY YEAR.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.753
HE'LL LIVE HIS LIFE LOOKING OVER

22:52.788 --> 22:53.754
HIS SHOULDER LOOKING FOR ME.

22:53.822 --> 22:55.289
[laughs]

22:55.323 --> 22:56.257
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE I'M AT

22:56.291 --> 22:57.258
RIGHT NOW.

23:03.098 --> 23:04.799
TO PLAY IT SAFE.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.567
SHE'S HEADING BACK TO FAIRBANKS

23:06.635 --> 23:08.636
TO GET HELP WITH A BRAKE PROBLEM

23:08.670 --> 23:10.337
SHE COULDN'T FIX HERSELF.

23:10.372 --> 23:11.739
>> OH, I FEEL REALLY STUPID

23:11.773 --> 23:13.541
BECAUSE I CREATED THIS PROBLEM

23:13.575 --> 23:15.843
FOR MYSELF.

23:17.279 --> 23:20.247
A PLACE TO TURN AROUND...

A FAMILIAR VOICE COMES OVER

23:21.817 --> 23:23.384
THE RADIO.

>> YEAH? GO AHEAD.

23:28.390 --> 23:31.459
WHO IS THIS?

23:31.526 --> 23:32.626
SWEET.

23:32.661 --> 23:33.627
CAN I MEET YOU ON THE TOP OF

23:33.662 --> 23:35.196
2 1/2, PRETTY PLEASE?

23:35.263 --> 23:40.835

23:42.270 --> 23:44.705
EXPERIENCED DRIVER, WAS LISA'S

23:44.739 --> 23:46.807
CONVOY PARTNER ON HER FIRST RUN.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.276
IT WAS RYAN WHO SUGGESTED LISA

23:49.311 --> 23:51.078
TRADE OUT HER OVERSIZED CAR

23:51.113 --> 23:52.079
CARRIER.

23:52.114 --> 23:53.747
A DECISION THAT SHE STILL

23:53.815 --> 23:54.982
REGRETS.

23:55.016 --> 23:58.018
AND TODAY, RYAN ONCE AGAIN IS ON

23:58.086 --> 24:00.621
THE SCENE.

24:01.890 --> 24:03.557
ON PLANET EARTH AND I FEEL

24:03.592 --> 24:04.625
STUPID FOR NOT KNOWING HOW TO DO

24:04.659 --> 24:05.726
IT.

24:05.794 --> 24:07.461
I'M TRYING TO ADJUST MY BRAKES,

24:07.496 --> 24:08.996
BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN THESE KIND

24:09.064 --> 24:10.698
BEFORE AND I DON'T WANT TO GO

24:10.732 --> 24:11.732
UNTIL EVERYTHING'S ADJUSTED

24:11.766 --> 24:12.366
RIGHT.

24:12.434 --> 24:13.334
>> RIGHT.

24:13.368 --> 24:14.168

24:14.236 --> 24:17.271
HOW TO BACK THEM OFF, I WOULD BE

24:17.339 --> 24:19.206
HAPPY AND I WILL EVEN DO IT.

24:19.274 --> 24:20.508
I JUST--

24:20.542 --> 24:21.909
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN.

IT.

>> narrator: WHAT LISA DIDN'T

24:32.087 --> 24:34.155
KNOW IS THAT A RELEASE MECHANISM

24:34.189 --> 24:35.723
LOCKS THE BRAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN

24:35.757 --> 24:37.158
PLACE.

HAPPENED AND THAT I HAVE TO ONCE

25:02.083 --> 25:06.053
AGAIN BE HELPED.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.087
I WANTED TO BE THE HELPER AND

OH, MY LORD.

25:28.443 --> 25:31.545
THAT DON'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL.

25:31.580 --> 25:35.516
THAT'S BAD.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.453
IT'S SCARY FOR ME TO SEE

25:39.521 --> 25:41.455
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, 'CAUSE

25:41.523 --> 25:43.424
NOBODY WANTS TO GO THROUGH THAT.

TOUGHEST THING, BEING ON THE

SO IT LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS ON

26:23.598 --> 26:26.267
LIFE SUPPORT...

26:26.301 --> 26:28.135
AND IT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD THAT HE

26:28.169 --> 26:29.169
HAD TO GET BACK TO ARIZONA RIGHT

26:29.237 --> 26:31.505
AWAY, SO HE TRIED GETTING A

26:33.541 --> 26:36.343
THE FLIGHT BY ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

26:39.948 --> 26:41.949

LIKE, "GEEZ, I SURE HOPE IT

26:55.664 --> 26:56.797
DON'T HAPPEN."

26:56.831 --> 26:57.865
