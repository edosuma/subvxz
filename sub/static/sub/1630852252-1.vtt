00:27.889 --> 00:31.376
[mellow orchestral music]

00:43.629 --> 00:45.148
- [Patrick] "Hello, Pat.

00:45.148 --> 00:49.118
I hope this comes as a
pleasant surprise to you.

00:49.118 --> 00:52.776
Well I believed you
killed, as Jack has been.

00:53.881 --> 00:56.677
I hope you are in good health.

00:57.885 --> 01:01.820
Pleased when this lot
is all over and finished

01:01.820 --> 01:04.788
so we can all get home again,

01:04.788 --> 01:05.686
what say.

01:07.205 --> 01:10.311
Well if you could tell me
what happened out there,

01:10.311 --> 01:13.590
I sure would be grateful to you,

01:13.590 --> 01:17.870
as mum still hopes that it
will turn out for the best.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.287
So please write when you can,

01:20.287 --> 01:25.188
and spare a few moments,
if it's just a few lines.

01:26.465 --> 01:28.916
So until next time
I'll say cheerio,

01:28.916 --> 01:30.987
and keep smiling.

01:30.987 --> 01:32.506
Your pal,

01:32.506 --> 01:33.334
Les."

01:36.165 --> 01:39.651
[mellow orchestral music]

01:51.214 --> 01:52.871
- [John] I'm gonna
press record on this,

01:52.871 --> 01:57.565
and we can start from when you
heard that the war broke out.

01:57.565 --> 02:01.362
- [Patrick] In 1939 on
the 3rd of September,

02:02.294 --> 02:04.227
war was declared.

02:04.227 --> 02:07.886
In the Royal Navy I
was a telegraphist,

02:07.886 --> 02:10.854
and my number was PJX 454 846.

02:13.754 --> 02:15.307
Never forgotten
it, you never do.

02:16.515 --> 02:19.863
[light orchestral music]

02:27.216 --> 02:30.736
[door knocking]

02:30.736 --> 02:32.013
- Patrick!
- Hey, John.

02:32.013 --> 02:33.498
- How are you?
- Yeah, all right.

02:33.498 --> 02:34.913
- Good to see you again!
- Good to see you again.

02:34.913 --> 02:36.501
- My name is John
Henry Phillips,

02:36.501 --> 02:39.711
and I'm a 25 year
old archeologist,
writer and historian.

02:39.711 --> 02:42.541
I love 20th century
conflict history,

02:42.541 --> 02:44.198
Second World War,
First World War.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.958
In 2015, I was in Normandy,

02:45.958 --> 02:48.513
and I met a really
gentle and sweet man

02:48.513 --> 02:49.790
called Patrick Thomas.

02:49.790 --> 02:52.448
Enjoying the sun?
- I have been.

02:52.448 --> 02:55.140
- Your fish doing all
right, they're healthy?

02:55.140 --> 02:56.693
- Ah, it's in a mess.

02:56.693 --> 02:57.901
- It looks great, Patrick.

02:57.901 --> 03:00.628
I volunteered on a

03:00.628 --> 03:03.286
charity project that takes
veterans back to Normandy.

03:03.286 --> 03:05.323
I have a bad habit of
signing up to things

03:05.323 --> 03:06.669
without really thinking
about what that means,

03:06.669 --> 03:07.980
so I said, "Yeah,
I'll come with you."

03:07.980 --> 03:09.361
Hadn't met anyone,

03:09.361 --> 03:11.052
so I turned up in
Portsmouth with a suitcase,

03:11.052 --> 03:14.366
and they said, "Okay,
you're in the Range Rover."

03:14.366 --> 03:17.058
So I opened the door and
there's an old man there,

03:17.058 --> 03:19.958
sat there with his carer.

03:19.958 --> 03:20.786
And I was like,

03:20.786 --> 03:21.684
"Oh, you all right?

03:21.684 --> 03:22.547
How are you?

03:22.547 --> 03:23.479
I'm John" and whatever.

03:23.479 --> 03:25.481
And he didn't respond.

03:25.481 --> 03:28.138
And his carer said,
"Oh, he's really deaf.

03:28.138 --> 03:29.657
You have to speak up."

03:29.657 --> 03:31.866
So I was like, "You all
right, Patrick!" [laughs]

03:31.866 --> 03:33.074
And so, I went up to the
people that organized it,

03:33.074 --> 03:34.559
and I said, "Oh,
what's this all about?

03:34.559 --> 03:36.388
I'm not on the thing, where
the hell am I sleeping?"

03:36.388 --> 03:39.115
And they were like, "Oh, well
Patrick's got a spare room."

03:39.115 --> 03:41.290
So I like, sheepishly
knocked on his door.

03:41.290 --> 03:43.430
I was like, "Oh yeah,
sorry. Can I sleep in here?"

03:43.430 --> 03:44.362
He did take me in,

03:44.362 --> 03:45.604
and we got on really well.

03:45.604 --> 03:46.881
- Now, look here.

03:46.881 --> 03:49.367
What about having a
drink of some sort,

03:49.367 --> 03:50.471
or what have you?

03:50.471 --> 03:52.162
Because-
- What shall we get?

03:52.162 --> 03:53.267
What shall we have?

03:53.267 --> 03:55.131
- Whatever you like.

03:55.131 --> 03:56.753
- What do you fancy, do
you want a cup of tea?

03:56.753 --> 03:58.099
Shall I make you a cup of tea?

03:58.099 --> 03:59.549
- I don't mind,

03:59.549 --> 04:00.792
I'm still drinking-
- Or are you on the wine?

04:00.792 --> 04:01.517
You've started early.
- I'm still drinking

04:01.517 --> 04:02.311
that wine.

04:02.311 --> 04:03.519
Now you're driving,

04:03.519 --> 04:05.279
so I wouldn't offer
you an alcoholic drink.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.729
You can have one
if you want one.

04:06.729 --> 04:08.282
[John laughs]

04:08.282 --> 04:09.732
- Everyone's like, "Oh, he's
talking about the war again."

04:09.732 --> 04:11.009
But obviously I'd never
lived with a D Day veteran,

04:11.009 --> 04:12.355
so I was like, "This is amazing!

04:12.355 --> 04:13.839
Tell me about Sword again.

04:13.839 --> 04:15.703
Tell me about you know,
being on the landing craft."

04:15.703 --> 04:18.327
People said to me, "Why did
you join the Royal Navy?"

04:18.327 --> 04:21.606
I said, "Well otherwise,
I'd have gone into the PBI.

04:21.606 --> 04:23.780
Poor bloody infantry.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.920
And they were always
up at the sharp end!"

04:25.920 --> 04:29.165
- My grandfather was in the RAF
during the Second World War,

04:29.165 --> 04:30.891
and then when got to
the end of his life,

04:30.891 --> 04:32.168
we'd had a few conversations

04:32.168 --> 04:34.274
about what did you
do during the war?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.276
And then suddenly he went like,

04:36.276 --> 04:37.725
really bad, really downhill.

04:38.795 --> 04:39.796
After my grandpa died,

04:39.796 --> 04:40.625
I started

04:41.971 --> 04:43.559
wanted to hear these stories,

04:43.559 --> 04:45.802
because I just wanted to
like, learn from these guys,

04:45.802 --> 04:50.600
and kind of make up for what
I didn't get out my grandpa.

04:52.568 --> 04:53.707
- Good afternoon, Mr. Thomas.

04:53.707 --> 04:54.915
What can we do for you today?

04:54.915 --> 04:56.710
- What can you do for me?

04:56.710 --> 04:58.056
- Bunch of flowers?

04:58.056 --> 04:59.782
- Bunch of-
- I think you wanted to

04:59.782 --> 05:00.990
chat to the women,

05:00.990 --> 05:02.819
didn't he?
- Well, I suppose so.

05:02.819 --> 05:05.201
What would you recommend
for my girlfriend?

05:05.201 --> 05:07.548
[all laughing]

05:07.548 --> 05:09.999
- Everywhere we go the women
flirt with you, don't they?

05:09.999 --> 05:11.207
- Well there you are, you see.

05:11.207 --> 05:12.691
[John laughs]

05:12.691 --> 05:14.452
- And I think when we went back
to Normandy the second time,

05:14.452 --> 05:16.488
and people were saying, "Oh,
I read your stuff online.

05:16.488 --> 05:17.489
You should print
it into a book."

05:17.489 --> 05:18.697
And he came up to me and said,

05:18.697 --> 05:21.424
"You know, we should
do my memoirs."

05:21.424 --> 05:23.392
- [Patrick] I was sent
back into Invergordon,

05:23.392 --> 05:26.809
where I joined LCH185.

05:26.809 --> 05:30.191
It was a landing
craft headquarters.

05:30.191 --> 05:32.090
- [John] So this photograph?

05:33.471 --> 05:34.437
- [Patrick] I was a
sprog in those days.

05:34.437 --> 05:36.232
- [John] A sprog.

05:36.232 --> 05:37.129
- [Patrick] Be 18.

05:38.614 --> 05:40.167
- I remember when I was 18,
I thought I was really old.

05:40.167 --> 05:41.755
And I'm 25 now,
that's not even old.

05:41.755 --> 05:45.172
Like, 25's young,
but 18 is so young.

05:45.172 --> 05:47.416
We take for granted
how strange that was,

05:47.416 --> 05:49.245
being told "Okay, you're
going to fly a plane now,

05:49.245 --> 05:51.696
so go and drop some
bombs over Berlin."

05:51.696 --> 05:53.249
You said that to
an 18 year old now,

05:53.249 --> 05:54.457
you said it to me
now, I'd be like,

05:54.457 --> 05:56.804
"No way, [laughs]
I'm not doing that."

05:56.804 --> 05:58.599
But they didn't have
a choice, you know.

05:58.599 --> 05:59.980
- [Patrick] For
about three months,

05:59.980 --> 06:02.845
we practiced landing troops.

06:02.845 --> 06:04.674
It was repetitive.

06:04.674 --> 06:06.435
We knew that we were practicing

06:06.435 --> 06:08.333
for the invasion of Normandy.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.542
- [John] So, it's
the night of D Day.

06:10.542 --> 06:12.958
It's pitch black and you're
heading towards Normandy.

06:12.958 --> 06:14.891
How do you feel?

06:14.891 --> 06:17.066
- [Patrick] I know I had
certain qualms in my stomach,

06:17.066 --> 06:20.207
but they quickly dismissed
that, because you're busy.

06:20.207 --> 06:22.347
But when we arrived
there initially,

06:22.347 --> 06:23.831
I knew we were there with them,

06:23.831 --> 06:26.489
because we didn't get a
very friendly welcome.

06:26.489 --> 06:29.181
[guns firing]

06:29.181 --> 06:32.184
There was a rattle of machine
gun bullets on the hull.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.463
All the capital ships opened up,

06:35.464 --> 06:37.051
and the shore line disappeared.

06:38.225 --> 06:40.434
I saw the infantry,
those champs.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.160
Ah, you certainly
handed it to them.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.437
Just running up the beach,

06:43.437 --> 06:46.302
or sometimes they'd
be shot and go down.

06:47.683 --> 06:50.617
The German's used to
fly over the top of us.

06:50.617 --> 06:53.240
On one occasion this
bomber came over,

06:53.240 --> 06:55.242
and I saw the object come down.

06:55.242 --> 06:57.658
What I didn't
realize at the time,

06:57.658 --> 07:00.316
it must have been
an acoustic mine.

07:01.662 --> 07:02.525
On the

07:02.525 --> 07:05.114
24th of June

07:05.114 --> 07:06.840
I was on the upper deck,

07:06.840 --> 07:09.636
I chose not to go down below.

07:09.636 --> 07:11.051
And it was a lovely sunny day,

07:11.051 --> 07:14.813
I took my shirt off and
lay on this camp bed.

07:14.813 --> 07:19.542
We were following our
sister craft, LCH269.

07:19.542 --> 07:22.821
There was a blinding flash
and a column of water.

07:22.821 --> 07:26.549
The next thing I knew,
we were underwater.

07:26.549 --> 07:28.240
[siren wailing]

07:28.240 --> 07:31.554
I was picked up after about
10 or 15 minutes I think,

07:31.554 --> 07:34.074
an LCG came by.

07:34.074 --> 07:38.492
It was the only time ever I
couldn't stop myself trembling.

07:38.492 --> 07:42.151
I absolutely trembled, it
must have been shock I think.

07:42.151 --> 07:47.121
I think there was a total of
nearly 40 who were, who died.

07:48.019 --> 07:50.780
[mellow orchestral music]

07:53.818 --> 07:54.922
Do you know what?

07:54.922 --> 07:57.787
I was so full of
emotion and so confused,

07:57.787 --> 08:00.341
I always felt there was
an outside influence

08:00.341 --> 08:01.584
somewhere there.

08:01.584 --> 08:03.621
I don't know what it
was, I don't know.

08:03.621 --> 08:08.142
I'm not a religious man, but
there was something there.

08:08.142 --> 08:10.938
It wasn't my time
to go, I suppose.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.288
- LCH185 is seemingly a mystery,

08:16.288 --> 08:19.947
because it went down to the
bottom of the English Channel,

08:19.947 --> 08:21.501
and just seems to
be forgotten about.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.709
No one knows where it is.

08:22.709 --> 08:24.124
No one knows where it went down.

08:24.124 --> 08:26.644
It's very hard to find anything
about it in the records.

08:26.644 --> 08:29.301
It's very hard to find any
personal accounts of it,

08:29.301 --> 08:31.649
because most of
the crew went down.

08:31.649 --> 08:34.479
- [Patrick] But when I
was eventually demobbed,

08:34.479 --> 08:36.101
it took me a long
time to settle down,

08:36.101 --> 08:38.448
because I'd done so much

08:38.448 --> 08:42.660
in that short period of
time in the Royal Navy.

08:42.660 --> 08:44.454
I'd done so much.

08:44.454 --> 08:46.836
- This is the easiest
anyone has ever had it.

08:46.836 --> 08:48.079
It really is amazing,

08:48.079 --> 08:49.529
and that's because of
people like Patrick

08:49.529 --> 08:50.702
and Patrick's generation,

08:50.702 --> 08:53.394
who fought to make this for us.

08:53.394 --> 08:54.879
- [Patrick] The thing
to remember is this.

08:54.879 --> 08:56.881
That when I was demobbed,

08:56.881 --> 09:00.091
there were thousands of
others who'd been demobbed,

09:00.091 --> 09:02.162
and they'd all got
a tale to tell.

09:03.473 --> 09:06.684
- There's no memorial to LCH185.

09:06.684 --> 09:08.755
There's only four
graves from the crew.

09:08.755 --> 09:10.584
There's a general
memorial in Arromanches

09:10.584 --> 09:12.552
for the Landing
Craft Association,

09:12.552 --> 09:15.693
which has now disbanded
through lack of veterans.

09:15.693 --> 09:17.453
They don't, it doesn't
exist any more.

09:17.453 --> 09:20.490
So there's no specific place
to say this is what 185 is,

09:20.490 --> 09:21.871
this is what 185 did,

09:21.871 --> 09:24.909
this is who lost
their lives on it.

09:24.909 --> 09:26.496
And I think that's a shame,

09:26.496 --> 09:28.568
because it's just
been lost to history.

09:28.568 --> 09:32.192
[mellow orchestral music]

09:32.192 --> 09:33.918
It's like we're on a
road trip together!

09:33.918 --> 09:34.781
- Yes.

09:34.781 --> 09:36.023
[John laughs]

09:36.023 --> 09:38.198
- Patrick is so full
of like, so happy.

09:38.198 --> 09:39.337
I don't know if that's the fact

09:39.337 --> 09:40.718
that he's been
through these traumas,

09:40.718 --> 09:42.754
and he knows just how
different it could have been.

09:42.754 --> 09:45.446
He knows that if he had have
gone below deck that night

09:45.446 --> 09:47.069
instead of sleeping up top,

09:47.069 --> 09:48.277
then he could have
been one of the men

09:48.277 --> 09:49.727
that went to the
bottom of the ocean.

09:49.727 --> 09:52.833
And that's such a heavy
burden to hold for 73 years,

09:52.833 --> 09:55.456
and to have not talked
about it for 70 of those.

09:55.456 --> 09:57.217
- [Patrick] That's the
pub we used to drink in!

09:57.217 --> 09:58.632
- [John] Really?

09:58.632 --> 09:59.944
- [Patrick] I'm sure of it.

09:59.944 --> 10:00.738
- [John] Oh, wow.

10:02.498 --> 10:04.293
So this is the
dock yard, Patrick.

10:04.293 --> 10:05.535
- [Patrick] Yes, part of it.

10:05.535 --> 10:07.468
- [John] Yeah, starting
to remember any of it?

10:07.468 --> 10:09.678
- I think we're going
in the right direction.

10:11.162 --> 10:14.337
- It was so clear when I took
Patrick up to the dockyard,

10:14.337 --> 10:17.271
and wheeled him
past HMS Victory,

10:17.271 --> 10:20.585
just how many memories
that brought back.

10:20.585 --> 10:22.760
- I can't be precise
where we were.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.037
- Yeah.

10:24.037 --> 10:24.969
- 'Cause there was
ships everywhere,

10:24.969 --> 10:26.211
as far as the eye could see.

10:26.211 --> 10:28.110
- [John] And which
way's Normandy?

10:28.110 --> 10:29.076
- Ooh. [laughs]

10:29.076 --> 10:31.389
[John and Patrick laughing]

10:31.389 --> 10:33.702
I've lost my Boy Scout
thing on that one.

10:34.944 --> 10:39.155
I never thought after 73
years I'd be here again,

10:39.155 --> 10:41.433
looking down at this

10:41.433 --> 10:42.711
dry dock.

10:42.711 --> 10:46.162
And when you look at it,
I forget how big it was.

10:46.162 --> 10:48.958
- So you knew when you
were here for the 24 hours,

10:48.958 --> 10:51.409
that the invasion
was very, very close?

10:51.409 --> 10:53.342
- It wasn't far
off, we knew that.

10:53.342 --> 10:54.619
- [John] Yeah.

10:54.619 --> 10:57.070
- We must have set sail
in the very early hours

10:57.070 --> 10:59.797
of the 6th, or even the 5th.

10:59.797 --> 11:03.214
And then, then we
set off for Normandy.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.044
- [John] What was the
sea like that night?

11:06.044 --> 11:07.321
- It was a bit bumpy.

11:08.909 --> 11:10.946
Got my sea legs by
then John, you see.

11:10.946 --> 11:12.223
[John laughs]

11:12.223 --> 11:14.432
- [John] So, 185 is
out there somewhere.

11:14.432 --> 11:15.502
- Out there somewhere.

11:17.055 --> 11:18.678
We change as we get older,

11:19.920 --> 11:23.475
and I maybe gave it a
thought all those years,

11:23.475 --> 11:27.548
but I never spoke
about it to anybody.

11:27.548 --> 11:29.827
Didn't tell anybody, you know.

11:29.827 --> 11:34.521
It's very difficult to
recall, to recall feelings

11:34.521 --> 11:36.178
about yours ships mates

11:37.524 --> 11:38.421
of all those years,

11:38.421 --> 11:40.078
70-odd years ago.

11:41.252 --> 11:42.978
When I think back,

11:42.978 --> 11:45.359
and I knew what had
happened to those young men.

11:46.326 --> 11:49.225
[mellow orchestral music]

11:49.225 --> 11:51.089
- If I could find the
ship, would that...

11:51.089 --> 11:52.263
Would that matter to you?

11:52.263 --> 11:55.542
Would that make a
difference to you know,

11:55.542 --> 11:57.613
your friends that you lost
and that sort of stuff?

11:57.613 --> 12:00.029
If we could pinpoint
where the ship is,

12:00.029 --> 12:02.894
would you then know that they,
you knew where they were,

12:02.894 --> 12:05.069
and there was a sense of
kind of closure to it?

12:05.069 --> 12:07.105
- I would love to know.

12:07.105 --> 12:10.660
I'd love to be able to
find out where it is.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.628
But I get the feeling

12:14.181 --> 12:16.252
there wouldn't be
a lot of it left,

12:17.529 --> 12:19.393
I get that feeling.

12:19.393 --> 12:21.085
Could be wrong, I don't know.

12:21.085 --> 12:22.534
- [John] Well that's
what we're gonna have to

12:22.534 --> 12:24.709
try and find out
together, isn't it?

12:24.709 --> 12:25.537
- If you...

12:25.537 --> 12:27.988
If ever you could find

12:27.988 --> 12:29.265
LCH185,

12:29.265 --> 12:31.371
I would be delighted.

12:31.371 --> 12:36.031
I would absolutely love that,
and I think it would be great.

12:37.515 --> 12:39.379
- It sounds strange because
I've not known him that long,

12:39.379 --> 12:42.658
but I feel like maybe
I owe it to him.

12:42.658 --> 12:46.455
If I can find that place
where Patrick's friends went,

12:47.663 --> 12:51.425
then that is closure to
a 73 year old mystery

12:51.425 --> 12:53.289
that deserves to be solved.

12:53.289 --> 12:55.498
That's the end goal, that's
what I'm striving for,

12:55.498 --> 12:59.399
to see you know, that
happiness of a man.

12:59.399 --> 13:02.574
And then after that you know,
what else can you ask for?

13:02.574 --> 13:03.748
I made the promise

13:04.922 --> 13:07.476
and I'm gonna try
my absolute hardest.

13:07.476 --> 13:09.098
And you know, even
if it kills me,

13:09.098 --> 13:10.720
I'm gonna find that ship.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.003
[light guitar music]

13:35.469 --> 13:38.093
So this is a photo
that Patrick sent me,

13:38.093 --> 13:41.441
and it's actually
of LCH185 on D day,

13:41.441 --> 13:43.823
speeding towards Sword Beach.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.964
This was the kinda
first lead that I had,

13:46.964 --> 13:50.174
when I asked Patrick where he
thought the ship went down.

13:50.174 --> 13:52.072
And he said, "I can't
be sure where we sunk,

13:52.072 --> 13:56.214
but we were following
our sister ship LCH269.

13:56.214 --> 13:57.491
More by instinct,

13:57.491 --> 13:59.183
I'm sure we weren't
far from gooseberry,

13:59.183 --> 14:00.840
west of Lion-sur-Mer,

14:00.840 --> 14:03.428
and a witness I
met confirmed this.

14:03.428 --> 14:05.189
And the "gooseberries"
were five break waters

14:05.189 --> 14:08.157
that they put in along
the beaches of Normandy.

14:08.157 --> 14:10.470
So, Lion-sur-Mer is
there on the map.

14:11.954 --> 14:15.095
I mean, it shouldn't be too
far away from about there.

14:15.993 --> 14:16.925
Has got me wondering now though,

14:16.925 --> 14:17.995
now that I'm looking at this.

14:17.995 --> 14:20.514
'Cause Lion-sur-Mer is there,

14:20.514 --> 14:23.863
and you can see it's not
actually on the gooseberry maps.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.347
There's Lion,

14:25.347 --> 14:28.212
and then Lion-sur-Mer
would be just cut off here,

14:28.212 --> 14:29.661
so I'm wondering if
it could actually be

14:29.661 --> 14:31.422
a little bit further
down the beach.

14:33.734 --> 14:37.152
[light orchestral music]

14:40.155 --> 14:42.398
I'm gonna meet an old
friend Mike Perrin,

14:42.398 --> 14:45.988
who is a maritime archeologist
and a diving instructor.

14:45.988 --> 14:48.197
So he's got a lot of
experience diving wrecks,

14:48.197 --> 14:49.440
and teaching people how to dive,

14:49.440 --> 14:51.235
and hopefully he'll
be able to fill me in

14:51.235 --> 14:52.753
on some of the challenges

14:52.753 --> 14:57.310
that I will face if I find the
ship and try and dive on it.

15:00.485 --> 15:02.280
- And are those-
- Room for one more?

15:02.280 --> 15:03.488
You all right guys?

15:03.488 --> 15:04.662
- Hi, how are you?
- You all right, Mike?

15:04.662 --> 15:05.421
- How's it going?
- Good to see you again.

15:05.421 --> 15:06.388
- Long time no see.

15:06.388 --> 15:07.182
- John.
- Hi, hello.

15:07.182 --> 15:08.666
- Nice to meet you.

15:08.666 --> 15:10.288
- Yeah, what's happening?
- Might be a little bit crazy,

15:10.288 --> 15:13.913
but I wanna find my friend's
sunken landing craft.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.431
And hoping to find it

15:15.431 --> 15:18.469
and build a memorial for
Patrick and his crew mates

15:18.469 --> 15:19.746
whilst he's still with us,

15:19.746 --> 15:21.644
so it's a bit of a
race against time.

15:21.644 --> 15:23.923
- Do you know where the boat is?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.407
- Not exactly.

15:25.407 --> 15:28.582
I mean, I've got some
ideas where it might be.

15:28.582 --> 15:31.723
I've spoken to
Patrick extensively

15:31.723 --> 15:33.484
about where he
thinks it could be.

15:33.484 --> 15:34.761
- Well we've got a
charter of the area here,

15:34.761 --> 15:35.900
let's have a look.

15:35.900 --> 15:36.832
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

15:36.832 --> 15:38.144
I'll see what I can point out.

15:41.112 --> 15:42.942
Okay, well that's Lion-sur-Mer

15:42.942 --> 15:44.150
where we went in.
- Okay.

15:44.150 --> 15:46.255
- He couldn't have sunk
any further really,

15:46.255 --> 15:50.535
than the gooseberry that he
was was at Lion-sur-Mer again,

15:50.535 --> 15:52.054
and close to it.

15:52.054 --> 15:53.745
- The gooseberries
were sunk outside

15:53.745 --> 15:55.368
the two Mulberry Harbors.

15:55.368 --> 15:56.610
One was the Arromanches,

15:56.610 --> 15:58.509
and one was further
west off Omaha Beach.

15:58.509 --> 16:00.476
- Oh right, so there
wasn't one at Lion?

16:00.476 --> 16:01.822
- No, there wasn't, no.

16:01.822 --> 16:04.170
What was the name
of the town again?

16:04.170 --> 16:05.343
- [John] Lion-sur-Mer.

16:05.343 --> 16:07.173
- Very, very similar
sounding name,

16:07.173 --> 16:09.761
right beside the
Arromanches Mulberry Harbor.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.729
Longues-sur-Mer, Lion-sur-Mer.

16:11.729 --> 16:13.593
- Perhaps Patrick's
got a bit confused,

16:13.593 --> 16:17.597
because he 100% went in at
Lion-sur-Mer at Sword Beach.

16:17.597 --> 16:20.220
Maybe he went back in
at Longues-sur-Mer,

16:20.220 --> 16:22.326
and just assumed they
were the same thing.

16:22.326 --> 16:23.568
So Mike, if you were
looking at this,

16:23.568 --> 16:25.743
and you had to find
a small landing craft

16:25.743 --> 16:27.331
in the middle of
the English Channel.

16:27.331 --> 16:29.057
- Um...

16:29.057 --> 16:30.610
Do you dive?

16:30.610 --> 16:31.921
- No.
- Ah, okay.

16:31.921 --> 16:32.750
Right.

16:32.750 --> 16:33.854
Step one.

16:33.854 --> 16:35.028
[both laughing]

16:35.028 --> 16:36.443
Well, my supervisor
back at Oxford

16:36.443 --> 16:39.170
said it's easier for an
archeologist to become a diver,

16:39.170 --> 16:40.482
than for a diver to become

16:40.482 --> 16:41.448
an archeologist.
- Well, that gives me hope.

16:41.448 --> 16:42.553
'Cause I am an archeologist.

16:42.553 --> 16:44.348
- There was
incredible hope there.

16:44.348 --> 16:45.590
- It has brought it home

16:45.590 --> 16:48.007
that it's a lot more
technically difficult,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.871
and I didn't really
plan on that.

16:50.871 --> 16:52.597
It was just, I'm
gonna find this thing.

16:52.597 --> 16:54.703
I'll come home like, "Patrick
look, I found the boat.

16:54.703 --> 16:55.980
Let's have some champagne."

16:55.980 --> 16:58.431
You know, I'm gonna have
to put a team together.

16:58.431 --> 17:01.330
[light guitar music]

17:01.330 --> 17:03.470
The next step on my journey
is to meet Stephen Fisher,

17:03.470 --> 17:05.369
who is a really
amazing historian

17:05.369 --> 17:07.957
who really cares about the
history of landing craft.

17:08.958 --> 17:10.167
Stephen.
- John.

17:10.167 --> 17:10.995
- How are you?

17:10.995 --> 17:11.927
Nice to meet you.

17:11.927 --> 17:13.411
- My name's Stephen Fisher,

17:13.411 --> 17:16.897
and I'm a freelance historical
researcher and archeologist.

17:16.897 --> 17:19.141
- When I called Stephen asking
for help on this journey,

17:19.141 --> 17:20.418
I didn't have that
much to offer him,

17:20.418 --> 17:22.110
so it's gonna be really
interesting to see

17:22.110 --> 17:23.559
what he's managed to drag up.

17:23.559 --> 17:24.974
- Now it's kind of difficult

17:24.974 --> 17:27.391
to find out about
individual ships on D Day,

17:27.391 --> 17:28.978
because they gave
them new numbers

17:28.978 --> 17:31.395
which are called landing
index table numbers.

17:31.395 --> 17:33.673
- So, 185 for D Day wasn't 185?

17:33.673 --> 17:35.123
- No.
- Oh, right.

17:35.123 --> 17:37.297
- It still had its identity
painted onto the hull,

17:37.297 --> 17:39.886
but it also had a second number

17:39.886 --> 17:41.957
which wasn't even called a
landing index table number,

17:41.957 --> 17:44.201
on Sword Beach they
called them fleet numbers,

17:45.305 --> 17:47.273
and that's the
number that you need.

17:47.273 --> 17:50.103
- It was absolutely mind blowing

17:50.103 --> 17:52.140
when Stephen told me that LCH185

17:52.140 --> 17:54.521
had a different
name just for D Day.

17:55.764 --> 17:56.937
That explains why
it's been so hard

17:56.937 --> 17:58.974
to find information
about the ship.

17:58.974 --> 18:01.735
That explains why no one
seems to have heard about it,

18:01.735 --> 18:04.393
and that explains why this
has been such a struggle.

18:04.393 --> 18:06.913
- By comparing information
in different documents,

18:06.913 --> 18:10.123
we can start to work
out that puzzle,

18:10.123 --> 18:12.850
and come up with the
other identity for 185.

18:12.850 --> 18:16.405
So we now know the fleet
number of the vessel

18:16.405 --> 18:18.407
that 185 was assigned.

18:18.407 --> 18:20.789
So these are all of the
other different vessels

18:20.789 --> 18:22.446
in the support squadron,

18:22.446 --> 18:24.620
basically carrying the DD tanks

18:24.620 --> 18:26.967
that were being
launched just off shore.

18:26.967 --> 18:30.799
Now this might almost sound
like it's slightly implausible,

18:30.799 --> 18:32.973
that no vessel
would get that close

18:32.973 --> 18:34.458
just before the
invasion started,

18:34.458 --> 18:37.530
but in fact that was the role
of the headquarters vessel.

18:37.530 --> 18:40.153
They needed to go and ascertain
the conditions on the beach,

18:40.153 --> 18:43.122
and how safe it was to
launch the DD tanks.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.606
- Suddenly all
these other archives

18:44.606 --> 18:47.091
have the name on
D Day of LCH185,

18:48.196 --> 18:49.162
and this wealth of information

18:49.162 --> 18:50.474
has come through that discovery.

18:50.474 --> 18:52.683
- I emphasize that
these are orders,

18:52.683 --> 18:54.823
so this is what was
supposed to happen.

18:54.823 --> 18:56.031
There's never any guarantee

18:56.031 --> 18:57.377
that it's actually
what happened.

18:57.377 --> 19:00.000
- The fact that LCH185
was in the first wave,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.520
the very first wave
on Sword Beach,

19:02.520 --> 19:04.419
I mean that is carving your name

19:04.419 --> 19:07.318
in the history of the world.

19:07.318 --> 19:09.424
- [Patrick] As we were
approaching the beach,

19:09.424 --> 19:12.737
I saw to me, they looked
like beautiful houses.

19:12.737 --> 19:14.360
And they looked marvelous.

19:14.360 --> 19:18.191
- We also have an account
of what LCH185 was doing,

19:18.191 --> 19:19.710
by this gentleman.

19:19.710 --> 19:24.577
And it's Dennis Musket, who
was actually posted to LCH185.

19:25.819 --> 19:26.820
- No way, I didn't
know this existed.

19:26.820 --> 19:28.684
- "On Tuesday the 6th of June,

19:28.684 --> 19:31.515
LCH185 proceeded close in shore.

19:31.515 --> 19:33.965
I could clearly see the color
of the houses on the front,

19:33.965 --> 19:35.174
all in tact."

19:35.174 --> 19:36.451
- That's what Patrick
told me, as well.

19:36.451 --> 19:37.383
He says he remembers the
beauty of these houses.

19:37.383 --> 19:39.592
- "In view of the sea conditions

19:39.592 --> 19:41.490
and the need to
conserve the tanks fuel,

19:41.490 --> 19:44.666
the decision was made
to hold on 5,000 yards

19:44.666 --> 19:46.668
before launching the DD tanks."

19:46.668 --> 19:48.290
- In the places
like Omaha Beach,

19:48.290 --> 19:51.293
where they put the Duplex
Drive tanks in too far away,

19:51.293 --> 19:54.296
they were overwhelmed by the
rough seas and the distance,

19:54.296 --> 19:56.367
and they sank to the bottom
of the English Channel.

19:56.367 --> 19:59.370
At Sword Beach, because of
the decision that 185 made,

19:59.370 --> 20:01.545
the tanks were able
to go onto the beach

20:01.545 --> 20:03.409
and really hit the Germans hard.

20:03.409 --> 20:05.549
It's absolutely amazing,
you've blown my mind.

20:05.549 --> 20:07.792
Thank you so much for-
- No problem at all.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.069
- It's incredible.

20:09.069 --> 20:12.314
I knew that LCH185
was there on D Day,

20:12.314 --> 20:14.661
and I knew that you
know, it had its role,

20:14.661 --> 20:16.145
but Stephen said it was actually

20:16.145 --> 20:20.253
one of the most important crafts
at Sword Beach on that day,

20:20.253 --> 20:22.738
and I don't think
Patrick realizes that.

20:22.738 --> 20:26.190
[light orchestral music]

20:28.986 --> 20:31.195
- I've been living here
in Normandy for 12 years,

20:31.195 --> 20:34.094
working as a battlefield
guide for that time.

20:34.094 --> 20:36.165
And I must admit,
when I first arrived,

20:36.165 --> 20:39.686
it was kind of just accepted
that the veterans were here.

20:39.686 --> 20:42.102
You could communicate
and learn their stories.

20:42.102 --> 20:44.657
Certainly in the last decade,
we're losing so many of them.

20:44.657 --> 20:47.176
Very soon this history will
be beyond living memory,

20:47.176 --> 20:50.041
and the veterans will
no longer be around

20:50.041 --> 20:52.768
to tell us their own
stories in their own words.

20:52.768 --> 20:55.219
- [John] So I'm in Normandy
on this kind of crazy journey

20:55.219 --> 20:57.290
to try and find LCH185,

20:57.290 --> 21:00.776
which was the craft of
my friend Patrick Thomas.

21:00.776 --> 21:01.846
- [Stuart] Yeah, I know Patrick.

21:01.846 --> 21:03.089
- [John] Yeah, yeah?

21:03.089 --> 21:04.332
- From the very first
moment I met him,

21:04.332 --> 21:05.505
I could tell he was
a real character,

21:05.505 --> 21:06.782
such an incredible man.

21:06.782 --> 21:08.646
And he told me about
his role on D Day,

21:08.646 --> 21:10.579
and I had to go straight home,

21:10.579 --> 21:13.617
get on Google you know, to
search and to find out more,

21:13.617 --> 21:15.170
because it's something that
I wasn't familiar with.

21:15.170 --> 21:16.309
- Yeah, no.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.552
I wasn't at all.

21:17.552 --> 21:19.070
So I made Patrick this
crazy promise that

21:19.070 --> 21:22.004
you know, I would find his boat,

21:22.004 --> 21:23.558
and he said,
"Absolutely, go for it."

21:23.558 --> 21:25.111
So I mean, what do
you think about that?

21:25.111 --> 21:26.664
Do you think that's doable?

21:26.664 --> 21:29.115
- You've got your work cut
out I think, very much so.

21:29.115 --> 21:31.531
- Patrick's ship went
down on the 25th of June,

21:31.531 --> 21:35.017
and he remembers after
he got rescued by an LCG,

21:35.017 --> 21:37.088
almost immediately after,
or a few hours after,

21:37.088 --> 21:39.332
being shelled
heavily by Le Havre.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.885
So was that still active,

21:40.885 --> 21:42.128
was that still
occupied at the time?

21:42.128 --> 21:43.060
- Very much so.

21:43.060 --> 21:44.303
If you imagine of course,

21:44.303 --> 21:45.959
Sword Beach is very
much the eastern most

21:45.959 --> 21:47.444
out of the five landing beaches,

21:47.444 --> 21:49.308
where the allies
came ashore on D Day.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.344
We had the huge
artillery batteries

21:51.344 --> 21:52.552
around the port of Le Havre,

21:52.552 --> 21:53.829
were actually within range

21:53.829 --> 21:56.522
and were shelling
the Allied Armada,

21:56.522 --> 21:58.731
which was occupying a
position of Sword Beach.

21:58.731 --> 22:00.215
- To be shelled by Le Havre,

22:00.215 --> 22:03.183
it must have to have gone
down in the Sword Beach area.

22:03.183 --> 22:04.392
- That would have
to be the case,

22:04.392 --> 22:07.084
if it was a victim of
that artillery fire

22:07.084 --> 22:08.396
from the Le Havre battery,

22:08.396 --> 22:09.086
that would have to
be the case, yeah.

22:09.086 --> 22:10.398
- Brilliant.

22:10.398 --> 22:12.469
- I think to find 185,
to find the location,

22:13.401 --> 22:15.057
it's gonna be difficult.

22:15.057 --> 22:17.094
If it was easy, it would
have been done before.

22:18.475 --> 22:20.028
- [Patrick] I didn't
hear the explosion,

22:20.028 --> 22:22.858
but the explosion must
have lifted the stern up

22:22.858 --> 22:25.136
and drove the bows under.

22:25.136 --> 22:28.726
The next thing I knew
we were under water,

22:28.726 --> 22:31.384
and that's when I saw Jack
Barringer's life boat.

22:31.384 --> 22:34.318
It was like a customized
boat, I knew it was Jack's.

22:34.318 --> 22:38.080
And I saw Jack a few yards
away throwing up his arms,

22:38.080 --> 22:39.150
he was badly injured.

22:40.289 --> 22:42.084
And this fellow, I remember him.

22:42.084 --> 22:45.536
He saw me with Jack's life belt
floating about in the water.

22:45.536 --> 22:48.815
I couldn't get it to Jack,
and so I let him have it.

22:48.815 --> 22:52.405
And poor Jack had disappeared
beneath the waves by then,

22:52.405 --> 22:55.512
and he must have been
very badly injured.

22:55.512 --> 22:57.203
Poor old Jack,
nothing I could do.

23:01.103 --> 23:04.659
[mellow orchestral music]

23:06.177 --> 23:09.388
- It's kind of the one name
that he associates with 185,

23:10.561 --> 23:12.632
and in a way I suppose
now because of that,

23:12.632 --> 23:14.634
it's the one name that
I associate with 185,

23:14.634 --> 23:15.911
other than Patrick.

23:15.911 --> 23:17.188
That day that the
ship went down,

23:17.188 --> 23:18.604
he could easily have
been bellow deck.

23:18.604 --> 23:19.881
And if it had have
been that way,

23:19.881 --> 23:21.365
then Patrick would
have died at 19,

23:21.365 --> 23:23.125
and he would have been here.

23:23.125 --> 23:24.575
But it's so far away from,

23:25.818 --> 23:28.234
from where LCH185
went down, you know.

23:28.234 --> 23:31.410
We're in land, we're not
that close to the beach,

23:32.859 --> 23:34.930
and I think Patrick would
love to be able to go there

23:34.930 --> 23:36.035
to remember 185.

23:37.899 --> 23:41.523
[mellow orchestral music]

23:41.523 --> 23:43.076
Bonjour, good to see you.

23:43.076 --> 23:44.595
I'm John.

23:44.595 --> 23:45.976
I'm so glad that you could
see me at such short notice,

23:45.976 --> 23:47.495
I'm really, really
grateful for that.

23:47.495 --> 23:49.738
I know you've gone out of your
way to do everything and...

23:49.738 --> 23:52.258
[translator speaks in French]

23:52.258 --> 23:54.536
Basically, I'm on
this sort of journey

23:54.536 --> 23:57.505
to get this promise
that I made to a friend.

23:57.505 --> 24:01.405
[translator speaks in French]

24:02.958 --> 24:06.168
So I was here recently for
the D Day commemorations,

24:06.168 --> 24:09.309
and I take back
veterans each year,

24:09.309 --> 24:12.416
and one in particular is a
man called Patrick Thomas.

24:12.416 --> 24:14.970
So, this is Patrick.

24:14.970 --> 24:17.732
[translator speaks in French]

24:17.732 --> 24:19.768
He was on board a landing craft.

24:19.768 --> 24:23.047
This is Patrick's actual craft.

24:23.047 --> 24:25.291
[translator speaks in French]

24:25.291 --> 24:28.156
That is a photograph of him
heading in Sword Beach here,

24:28.156 --> 24:29.364
and it's called LCH185.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.367
And so, on the 25th of June,

24:32.367 --> 24:35.819
Patrick was asleep on
the deck of the boat,

24:35.819 --> 24:37.855
and it was hit by
one of the mines,

24:37.855 --> 24:41.445
and most of the crew died
and went down with the ship.

24:41.445 --> 24:43.516
So I made this
promise to Patrick,

24:43.516 --> 24:46.001
that I was gonna do two things.

24:46.001 --> 24:49.971
If I could, I was gonna
try and find his shipwreck,

24:49.971 --> 24:51.593
because he doesn't
know where it is.

24:51.593 --> 24:56.495
And then two, build him a
memorial in Lion-sur-Mer,

24:56.495 --> 24:59.981
because his story
so definitively

24:59.981 --> 25:01.327
features Lion-sur-Mer.

25:01.327 --> 25:04.882
In his mind, his
spiritual home is here.

25:04.882 --> 25:09.646
So I was just hoping I could
get an idea from the Mayor,

25:09.646 --> 25:13.304
what he'd think about putting
a memorial in this town.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.859
- It's a very good idea.
- Yeah?

25:15.859 --> 25:17.136
- Yeah, yeah.

25:17.136 --> 25:19.345
- That's amazing,
that means a lot.

25:19.345 --> 25:22.935
[Mayor speaks in French]

25:22.935 --> 25:23.763
- For the memory of Patrick,
it's an amazing idea.

25:26.939 --> 25:28.872
[Mayor speaks in French]

25:28.872 --> 25:33.290
- And for Lion-sur-Mer
it's really an honor.

25:33.290 --> 25:34.567
- Yes.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.189
- That's so nice, I'm
so pleased with that.

25:36.189 --> 25:38.709
It's such an honor,
thank you so much.

25:38.709 --> 25:42.161
[Mayor speaks in French]

25:42.161 --> 25:45.440
- Can Patrick come
in Lion-sur-Mer and
maybe meet the Mayor?

25:45.440 --> 25:48.098
- Oh, that would
mean so much to him.

25:48.098 --> 25:48.995
He'd be honored.

25:48.995 --> 25:50.100
- Okay.
- Yeah?

25:50.100 --> 25:51.584
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Okay.

25:51.584 --> 25:54.691
Thank you so, so much Dominique,
I really appreciate that.

25:56.209 --> 25:58.039
Patrick, I went for a meeting

25:58.039 --> 26:00.386
with the Mayor of Lion-sur-Mer.

26:00.386 --> 26:01.905
- [Patrick] Yes?

26:01.905 --> 26:04.666
- And he said he'd absolutely
love you to get a memorial.

26:04.666 --> 26:07.186
He said it would be
an honor for him.

26:07.186 --> 26:08.739
- Oh.

26:08.739 --> 26:10.499
- [John] Even better he said
normally it takes a few years,

26:10.499 --> 26:11.915
but he wants to try
and get it there

26:11.915 --> 26:14.124
for the D Day commemorations.

26:14.124 --> 26:15.643
- [Patrick] Crumbs,
I think it's great.

26:15.643 --> 26:17.714
- [John] Not only that, he
wants you to come and visit him,

26:17.714 --> 26:18.818
so he can meet you.

26:20.026 --> 26:21.303
- Wants me to visit him?

26:21.303 --> 26:23.029
- [John] Yeah, he
wants to meet you.

26:23.996 --> 26:24.824
- [Patrick] Does he?

26:24.824 --> 26:26.274
Well, that's marvelous.

26:26.274 --> 26:28.483
- The fact that the
Mayor cared about Patrick

26:28.483 --> 26:29.967
is a huge deal,

26:29.967 --> 26:33.315
because it's one thing
to build an object,

26:33.315 --> 26:35.248
you know, put the
bricks and mortar there,

26:35.248 --> 26:37.526
but to have the town
embrace Patrick,

26:37.526 --> 26:40.081
and the man who runs the
town embrace Patrick,

26:40.081 --> 26:41.738
I think meant more
to him than anything.

26:41.738 --> 26:44.395
That was what got the biggest
reaction when I called him.

26:44.395 --> 26:45.327
- [Patrick] Oh, that's good.

26:45.327 --> 26:47.122
- I wish you were here, Patrick.

26:47.122 --> 26:49.262
- [Patrick] Okay, I'll
hear from you again.

26:49.262 --> 26:50.781
- Yep.

26:50.781 --> 26:54.647
And Patrick is gonna have
his story told forever.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.239
Now I'm gonna have to
put this team together,

27:00.239 --> 27:02.517
and see if I can get some
people who wanna tell the story,

27:02.517 --> 27:05.313
who are passionate about
bringing this story home.

27:06.176 --> 27:08.109
[phone ringing]

27:08.109 --> 27:11.733
Hi Chris, nice to finally
talk to you properly.

27:11.733 --> 27:12.665
Throughout this whole journey

27:12.665 --> 27:15.392
of trying to find this boat,

27:15.392 --> 27:17.014
I've always kind of had
you in the back of my mind,

27:17.014 --> 27:18.498
knowing that you've done
this stuff in the past

27:18.498 --> 27:20.259
with the surveying and
all that sort of thing.

27:20.259 --> 27:23.918
So it's brilliant to
finally get you on here,

27:23.918 --> 27:25.471
and have a chat.

27:25.471 --> 27:30.062
- Most of the ships are still
there in some form or another.

27:30.062 --> 27:31.511
Not very good condition,

27:31.511 --> 27:35.067
because Normandy had
a high tidal range,

27:36.102 --> 27:38.864
it had a strong tidal current,

27:38.864 --> 27:41.521
and it does erode steel.

27:41.521 --> 27:44.835
- But gooseberry five is
a real kind of key clue

27:44.835 --> 27:46.630
in this search for 185.
- Yeah.

27:46.630 --> 27:49.288
- Is any of that
there at all, still?

27:49.288 --> 27:51.186
- Well funnily enough,

27:51.186 --> 27:53.154
that's been a question
that's been bugging me

27:53.154 --> 27:54.914
for quite a while.

27:54.914 --> 27:56.364
The idea behind the survey

27:56.364 --> 27:58.884
was to cover as
far as they could,

27:58.884 --> 28:02.922
and they found about
650 things on the bottom

28:02.922 --> 28:05.753
that were identifiable.

28:05.753 --> 28:08.479
I think I know where it is.

28:08.479 --> 28:09.722
- Really?
- I think we did cover it

28:09.722 --> 28:11.620
in the 2013 survey.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.381
- You think you
know where it is?

28:13.381 --> 28:16.108
- I think there is a
record of it, of...

28:16.108 --> 28:17.592
Well not a record,

28:17.592 --> 28:19.698
I think there is the remains
of it on the sea floor,

28:22.217 --> 28:24.772
off shore from gooseberry five.

28:24.772 --> 28:28.637
Here are the ships
within gooseberry five.

28:28.637 --> 28:30.156
The Corvette is here.

28:30.156 --> 28:33.332
This one here is my candidate

28:33.332 --> 28:34.264
for

28:34.264 --> 28:35.092
LCH185.

28:39.165 --> 28:40.304
- I just can't believe it.

28:40.304 --> 28:42.375
It's just, it's
absolutely mind blowing.

28:42.375 --> 28:43.687
That gives me confidence,

28:43.687 --> 28:46.034
'cause I don't know if
I've told you before,

28:46.034 --> 28:48.416
but I'm gonna have to
learn to dive to do this.

28:48.416 --> 28:49.693
So. [laughs]
- Right.

28:49.693 --> 28:51.557
I have come across
a group of divers,

28:51.557 --> 28:54.249
and they are willing to
come over and dive with you.

28:55.630 --> 28:59.841
- We heard that a young
archeologist had made a promise,

28:59.841 --> 29:02.671
and he sort of said he
was learning to dive,

29:02.671 --> 29:06.089
or wanted to learn to dive in
order to fulfill this promise.

29:06.089 --> 29:10.127
- Because we'd already been
over to Normandy last year,

29:11.059 --> 29:12.716
yeah, we were up for it.

29:12.716 --> 29:15.754
[light guitar music]

29:23.382 --> 29:26.178
I think if anyone comes
to you with a story

29:26.178 --> 29:28.318
of the nature of Patrick's,

29:28.318 --> 29:31.493
finding where their
last resting place is

29:31.493 --> 29:33.841
and having that

29:33.841 --> 29:36.015
closure for people

29:36.015 --> 29:37.396
is a big puzzle,

29:37.396 --> 29:38.673
and we try to

29:39.570 --> 29:40.917
solve puzzles.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.988
We had to pull together a team

29:42.988 --> 29:45.542
of a minimum of
six divers, really.

29:45.542 --> 29:50.029
So we've got Martin
as expedition leader,

29:50.029 --> 29:53.032
he's responsible for
everything. [laughs]

29:53.032 --> 29:54.482
And then we've got other people

29:54.482 --> 29:58.003
who are qualified in
survey techniques.

29:58.003 --> 29:59.625
We've worked together before.

29:59.625 --> 30:01.869
Well I say work,
but it isn't is it?

30:01.869 --> 30:06.114
It's recreation diving
but with a real purpose,

30:06.114 --> 30:07.771
so we're not employed
to do any of this,

30:07.771 --> 30:08.737
this is just

30:10.670 --> 30:12.776
something that's driven in us

30:12.776 --> 30:16.918
just to do that extra bit,
and find out what we can.

30:20.957 --> 30:24.857
- I'm in France, I got the
overnight ferry last night.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.963
I'm trying to find
these two houses

30:26.963 --> 30:30.932
that Patrick's craft would
have been aiming to reach

30:30.932 --> 30:32.485
at Sword Beach,

30:32.485 --> 30:35.350
and I got the coordinates
off of Stephen yesterday.

30:36.938 --> 30:38.215
And it's taking me,

30:38.215 --> 30:39.838
not to Lion-sur-Mer,
but to Hermonville,

30:39.838 --> 30:42.116
which is different
to what I've heard.

30:42.116 --> 30:43.358
So it's gonna be
quite interesting

30:43.358 --> 30:45.222
to see if I can find them.

30:45.222 --> 30:46.465
It's confusing,

30:46.465 --> 30:48.363
because if this is where
those two houses are.

30:48.363 --> 30:51.815
If I can find the houses that
I've been sent to look for,

30:51.815 --> 30:53.196
and it's not in Lion-sur-Mer,

30:54.749 --> 30:56.855
then Patrick's story
has completely changed,

30:56.855 --> 30:58.408
and then does that change

30:58.408 --> 31:00.168
where the ship might
have gone down?

31:01.445 --> 31:03.620
In fact, I think these
might be the houses.

31:13.975 --> 31:16.598
[Phone ringing]

31:17.806 --> 31:19.049
- [Stephen] Hello,
Stephen Fisher?

31:19.049 --> 31:21.017
- You all right
Stephen, it's John.

31:21.017 --> 31:21.845
- [Stephen] Hello, John.

31:21.845 --> 31:23.502
- How you doing?

31:23.502 --> 31:24.537
- [Stephen] Yeah, I'm good.

31:24.537 --> 31:25.366
How are you?
- Yeah?

31:25.366 --> 31:26.194
I'm all right, yeah.

31:26.194 --> 31:26.988
A bit confused.

31:26.988 --> 31:27.782
We're in Normandy,

31:29.439 --> 31:32.235
and I've just tracked
down these houses.

31:32.235 --> 31:33.512
- [Stephen] Yep.

31:33.512 --> 31:34.547
- And they're not in
Lion-sur-Mer at all,

31:34.547 --> 31:36.860
they're in Hermonville-sur-Mer,

31:36.860 --> 31:39.932
which is about two miles
further down the beach.

31:41.347 --> 31:42.245
- [Stephen] Was it definitely
the right houses, yeah?

31:42.245 --> 31:43.487
- Definitely, yeah.

31:43.487 --> 31:45.248
It's really great
work with that.

31:45.248 --> 31:46.559
They haven't changed
at all, yeah.

31:46.559 --> 31:47.871
It's amazing.

31:47.871 --> 31:49.459
So Patrick's always
told me this story

31:49.459 --> 31:53.256
that his craft was heading
towards Lion-sur-Mer on D Day,

31:53.256 --> 31:56.397
but he remembers vividly
when landing at Sword Beach,

31:56.397 --> 31:58.606
these houses shining
in the French sunlight,

31:58.606 --> 32:00.194
these beautiful French houses.

32:00.194 --> 32:01.920
And I follow the coordinates
that Stephen gave me,

32:01.920 --> 32:03.300
and it took me to a town

32:03.300 --> 32:05.578
called Hermonville-sur-Mer,
not Lion-sur-Mer,

32:05.578 --> 32:07.891
which was really confusing.

32:07.891 --> 32:10.031
But I've just got off
the phone with Stephen,

32:10.031 --> 32:13.207
and it seems as if
Hermonville-sur-Mer
is a newer edition.

32:13.207 --> 32:15.209
In the war, all of this
was just countryside.

32:15.209 --> 32:17.349
And so, once they've put
all these new houses in,

32:17.349 --> 32:18.626
it needed a new name,

32:18.626 --> 32:19.627
and that seems to
be what's happened.

32:19.627 --> 32:21.111
When I said to Patrick,

32:21.111 --> 32:22.423
I'll find your ship,
I'll build your memorial,

32:22.423 --> 32:23.976
it seemed like a
pretty simple task.

32:23.976 --> 32:26.254
Go to France, find where
the ship went down,

32:26.254 --> 32:28.429
put a plaque up. You know,
this is harder than I thought,

32:28.429 --> 32:31.742
just to find out where the
ship was on top of the water,

32:31.742 --> 32:33.192
let alone underneath it.

32:33.192 --> 32:34.400
What next, yeah. [laughs]

32:34.400 --> 32:35.712
What is this gonna
throw up next?

32:37.162 --> 32:38.473
[divers chattering]

32:38.473 --> 32:40.924
[engine revving]

32:40.924 --> 32:42.098
- Hello, you!

32:42.098 --> 32:43.064
- Hello.
- How you doing?

32:43.064 --> 32:44.238
- How are you?
- Long time.

32:44.238 --> 32:44.893
- Hey.
- Nice to finally meet you.

32:44.893 --> 32:45.549
- Thank you.

32:45.549 --> 32:46.930
- Good journey?

32:46.930 --> 32:48.621
- Oh yeah, it was all
right. Not too bad.

32:48.621 --> 32:49.450
- Yeah, we're good.
- Nice to see you.

32:49.450 --> 32:51.072
- So, we're all here.

32:51.072 --> 32:53.005
- We are, at last.
- Finally.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.179
- At last.

32:54.179 --> 32:55.214
- So, how was this morning?

32:55.214 --> 32:56.595
All good?

32:56.595 --> 32:58.217
- Could have been better.
- Yeah?

32:58.217 --> 32:59.425
- Yeah.

32:59.425 --> 33:01.151
We've had a little
incident this morning.

33:01.151 --> 33:02.497
- Okay.

33:02.497 --> 33:05.017
- You'll notice the
engine cover is off.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.225
- Okay.

33:06.225 --> 33:07.744
- So we had a little
problem with the engine.

33:07.744 --> 33:10.989
It's been making very funny
noises, quite concerning.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.612
It sounded like a bag of stones.

33:13.612 --> 33:15.855
Yeah, just it was
really rattling along.

33:15.855 --> 33:18.410
We're gonna have to go
to the marina tomorrow,

33:18.410 --> 33:20.550
to see if we can get that fixed.

33:20.550 --> 33:23.139
- Okay, so you managed
to get the buoy out?

33:23.139 --> 33:24.278
- No, we didn't.
- You didn't?

33:24.278 --> 33:26.073
- No, no, no.
- Oh, okay.

33:26.073 --> 33:28.696
- So, we've still
got that job to do.

33:28.696 --> 33:30.111
[sighs] Yes.
- It happens.

33:30.111 --> 33:31.664
- Welcome to the
world of diving.

33:31.664 --> 33:33.356
- Yeah, right.

33:33.356 --> 33:34.529
A nice welcome.

33:34.529 --> 33:35.806
- Disappointing,
'cause we're all set,

33:35.806 --> 33:37.015
ready to go.
- Well, I can imagine.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.223
You must be so pumped
up and ready to do it.

33:38.223 --> 33:40.432
- Well, and you too.
- Yeah.

33:40.432 --> 33:41.916
Splutter your way to the shore.

33:41.916 --> 33:45.126
- So, then we'll set
up our headquarters.

33:45.126 --> 33:47.749
- And Stephen, you've
got some LCH plans.

33:47.749 --> 33:50.028
- Yeah, got some
useful documents.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.030
Hopefully, it'll give us a
little more of an insight

33:52.030 --> 33:54.101
into the diagnostic
features to look for.

33:54.101 --> 33:56.655
- You'll remember that
we went to Marseilles,

33:56.655 --> 33:58.657
to meet the people at Drassom.

33:58.657 --> 34:02.799
And she showed us the
multi-beam sonar images

34:02.799 --> 34:04.904
from their survey last year.

34:06.113 --> 34:07.700
They believe it's
a different wreck.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.496
- Yeah, yeah.
- So, our money's on

34:11.394 --> 34:12.567
the LCH.
- Yeah.

34:12.567 --> 34:14.086
I mean, having
looked at it myself,

34:14.086 --> 34:15.501
I'm not convinced that it's
another boat on its side.

34:15.501 --> 34:16.916
That seems-
- No.

34:16.916 --> 34:18.470
- I couldn't work out
how that could be-

34:18.470 --> 34:19.747
- No.

34:19.747 --> 34:21.231
There should be
some key features,

34:21.231 --> 34:24.579
assuming that they're left
there on the seabed for us,

34:24.579 --> 34:26.616
to help nail it
once and for all.

34:26.616 --> 34:27.582
- Yeah.

34:27.582 --> 34:28.825
Archeology always goes wrong,

34:28.825 --> 34:30.068
that's pretty much
90% of the time.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.036
I mean, I'm very much
used to this feeling.

34:34.210 --> 34:35.935
- So we're heading
down to Ouistreham,

34:35.935 --> 34:39.318
where we can check
out our engine.

34:39.318 --> 34:40.871
- Quiet day in France,

34:40.871 --> 34:43.115
a lot of shops and
businesses are closed.

34:45.842 --> 34:48.672
[team chattering]

34:50.329 --> 34:51.848
- We've been granted permission

34:51.848 --> 34:54.368
for me to dive the wreck
at the end of the survey,

34:54.368 --> 34:56.956
to help Patrick say
goodbye to those guys.

34:58.406 --> 35:00.581
Patrick can't go down there
and see it after 74 years,

35:00.581 --> 35:01.789
but as his friend,

35:01.789 --> 35:03.342
it's almost as if I'm
kind of the vessel

35:03.342 --> 35:04.585
for Patrick to go down there.

35:04.585 --> 35:06.518
I'm like, I'm Patrick
submarine I suppose,

35:06.518 --> 35:08.658
that can go down there
and see it for him.

35:08.658 --> 35:10.073
And to be able to come
back and say like,

35:10.073 --> 35:11.557
"We did it, Patrick.

35:11.557 --> 35:12.834
We went down there."

35:20.221 --> 35:22.603
- So they've got no time
to have a look at anything,

35:22.603 --> 35:25.399
but he suggested
their competitors,

35:25.399 --> 35:28.091
or colleagues next door.

35:28.091 --> 35:29.782
- Right.
- Right, okay.

35:29.782 --> 35:32.647
- We realized we had
to abandon the boat,

35:33.717 --> 35:34.960
so plan B.

35:37.790 --> 35:39.516
So, here we are.
- Yeah.

35:39.516 --> 35:41.208
And what's the plan, then?

35:41.208 --> 35:44.625
- Unfortunately,
none of the mechanics

35:44.625 --> 35:46.005
could look at the boat.

35:46.005 --> 35:47.110
They didn't have time,

35:47.110 --> 35:48.560
they're very busy.
- Okay.

35:48.560 --> 35:52.840
- I've completed the paperwork
online for renting a boat

35:52.840 --> 35:53.668
tomorrow,

35:53.668 --> 35:54.635
so let's just hope.

35:54.635 --> 35:56.119
- Is it two dives tomorrow?

35:56.119 --> 35:58.466
- The first pair is
gonna go in and establish

35:58.466 --> 35:59.916
what we call a "shot-line",

35:59.916 --> 36:01.124
where we'll shot the
wreck with the shot-line,

36:01.124 --> 36:02.850
and then we'll
establish what we can,

36:02.850 --> 36:04.990
what we're gonna call
a permanent buoy.

36:04.990 --> 36:07.717
- The wreck is
how deep, roughly?

36:07.717 --> 36:08.994
About...

36:08.994 --> 36:11.272
- I think ultimately
it's around 21 meters,

36:11.272 --> 36:12.480
but I think tomorrow,

36:12.480 --> 36:14.551
we'll be looking
about 19, 20 meters.

36:14.551 --> 36:16.312
- Cecille at Drassom,

36:16.312 --> 36:19.453
have actually recorded this
as a landing craft gun,

36:20.833 --> 36:24.872
which was based on a
landing craft tank platform,

36:24.872 --> 36:29.773
so it had a bow door which
opened to let the tanks out.

36:30.912 --> 36:32.155
The difference
between a tank door

36:32.155 --> 36:35.434
and obviously a pointed bow,

36:35.434 --> 36:37.125
is gonna be one of
the main features.

36:37.125 --> 36:40.128
So here we have the
multi-beam image

36:40.128 --> 36:43.477
taken from the UK
Hydrographic Office.

36:43.477 --> 36:46.549
Chris Howlett has overlaid

36:46.549 --> 36:47.584
this plan

36:47.584 --> 36:48.551
onto

36:48.551 --> 36:50.069
that image.

36:50.069 --> 36:53.521
This particular piece here,
looks a fairly good match.

36:53.521 --> 36:54.902
- Yeah.
- In theory.

36:54.902 --> 36:57.836
But actually it'll
be eyes underwater

36:57.836 --> 36:59.078
that are looking at that,

36:59.078 --> 37:00.839
and measuring with
a tape measure.

37:00.839 --> 37:05.568
This is the area we like
to measure particularly.

37:05.568 --> 37:07.915
This is what we
think is the stern.

37:07.915 --> 37:11.919
We'll also make our way up to
what appears to be the bow,

37:11.919 --> 37:15.060
the yellow dot right
at the end there.

37:15.060 --> 37:18.443
Landing crafts headquarters
had a special modification,

37:18.443 --> 37:23.413
which was a special mast
with a radar on the top.

37:24.897 --> 37:28.384
So this piece, this piece, and
maybe at the stern as well,

37:29.626 --> 37:31.801
will be some of the key
areas for us to look at.

37:31.801 --> 37:34.873
- The schedule is you know,
written to every minute,

37:34.873 --> 37:36.357
and there was no doubt
that we were gonna

37:36.357 --> 37:38.497
locate that wreck and
try and identify it.

37:38.497 --> 37:40.258
That was gonna be the hard part.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.845
Identifying it and
doing the survey,

37:41.845 --> 37:43.537
and we were worried
about visibility,

37:43.537 --> 37:45.332
we were worried about
the current, the cold.

37:45.332 --> 37:48.231
Now we've has to worry
about not having a boat,

37:48.231 --> 37:49.853
so we've not even
gotten to the point

37:49.853 --> 37:52.200
where we were supposed
to be worried.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.513
[laughs] This is like
the pre-worry, I suppose.

37:55.928 --> 37:59.035
- Okay, this is the main
structure we're gonna aim for.

37:59.035 --> 38:02.245
So we think the stern's lump
is sort of here, as well.

38:02.245 --> 38:03.591
[phone beeps]

38:03.591 --> 38:04.558
What's that?

38:05.904 --> 38:07.146
- Yay, we got the boat!
- Wahey!

38:07.146 --> 38:09.079
- We got the boat.
- Fantastic, fantastic.

38:09.079 --> 38:10.426
- Hey, guys!

38:10.426 --> 38:11.392
We got a boat!

38:12.945 --> 38:13.774
Brilliant.

38:16.224 --> 38:18.503
As soon as the whale
bag's in the car.

38:18.503 --> 38:21.299
[team chattering]

38:27.166 --> 38:30.653
[light orchestral music]

38:32.171 --> 38:34.933
[engine revving]

38:42.009 --> 38:45.392
[light orchestral music]

38:52.882 --> 38:56.230
- [groans] There we go.

38:57.473 --> 39:00.890
[light orchestral music]

39:02.409 --> 39:05.860
- Sadly, the boat isn't
really geared up for diving.

39:05.860 --> 39:07.586
It's a smaller boat,

39:07.586 --> 39:11.487
this other boat was
a good meter shorter,

39:11.487 --> 39:15.042
and was more pleasure
boat or fishing boat.

39:15.042 --> 39:18.217
- Our expectation
of it was much,

39:18.217 --> 39:20.944
much more than actually
it's capabilities were.

39:20.944 --> 39:21.911
- We've left you mark,

39:21.911 --> 39:23.740
mark way points where you are,

39:23.740 --> 39:25.086
but I've struggled to find

39:25.086 --> 39:27.192
where to actually input
them in the system.

39:27.192 --> 39:30.229
- We had some
interesting experience

39:30.229 --> 39:32.197
with trying to work
out the electronics.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.131
- Press down.
- There isn't one.

39:35.131 --> 39:37.754
Boat basically took
on a lot of water,

39:37.754 --> 39:39.963
it was probably overloaded.

39:39.963 --> 39:41.102
- It's good, it's good.

39:42.794 --> 39:44.934
It'll get us there, that's
the important thing.

39:44.934 --> 39:48.420
[engine revving]

39:48.420 --> 39:50.733
- We'd probably, ideally
look at a five day window

39:50.733 --> 39:52.390
for this type of project.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.634
- We're limited
to this window of

39:55.634 --> 39:57.843
no tide, no current,

39:57.843 --> 39:59.845
where we can do that activity.

39:59.845 --> 40:03.815
And then the tide starts to
change and the current picks up,

40:03.815 --> 40:06.300
and you can't work
in those conditions.

40:06.300 --> 40:09.096
[waves crashing]

40:09.096 --> 40:11.236
- Not being a commercial diver,

40:11.236 --> 40:14.826
essentially means that
I've had to lead the survey

40:14.826 --> 40:16.621
topside for five days,

40:16.621 --> 40:18.174
which has been
incredibly frustrating.

40:18.174 --> 40:19.693
To be at this point now

40:19.693 --> 40:21.108
where I'm actually going into
the water, is a huge thing.

40:21.108 --> 40:23.662
And at this point
I've only shore dived,

40:23.662 --> 40:25.492
and that's totally different.

40:25.492 --> 40:27.286
We'll see what it's like
when we get out there.

40:27.286 --> 40:29.910
I mean, I'm always
up for a challenge.

40:29.910 --> 40:31.463
There's no way I'm not doing it.

40:32.568 --> 40:35.294
[engine revving]

40:37.607 --> 40:38.953
- We searched for two hours

40:38.953 --> 40:41.542
and just found
effectively a flat seabed,

40:41.542 --> 40:45.926
not helped by a very lumpy
sea going up and down.

40:45.926 --> 40:48.687
[engine revving]

40:49.757 --> 40:52.484
[waves crashing]

41:00.112 --> 41:01.700
After being out
there for two hours,

41:01.700 --> 41:04.254
I think we'd all had enough
and we called it a day.

41:08.707 --> 41:11.399
[engine revving]

41:12.884 --> 41:15.576
- Hey, John.
- Yeah?

41:15.576 --> 41:16.853
How are you going?

41:16.853 --> 41:18.199
- We didn't find it.
- You didn't find it?

41:18.199 --> 41:19.925
- We spent two hours-
- Geez.

41:19.925 --> 41:21.686
- On the sonar
trying to find it,

41:21.686 --> 41:22.721
and we can't find it.

41:22.721 --> 41:24.309
- So, what's the plan now?

41:24.309 --> 41:25.586
- Try again.
- Yeah?

41:25.586 --> 41:26.484
- As ever.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.623
- Get warm.
- Yep.

41:27.623 --> 41:29.107
We don't give in.
- Oh well.

41:29.107 --> 41:30.453
- Oh yeah, we need to warm up!
- Better go and get warm.

41:30.453 --> 41:32.420
Yeah, totally.
- Okay, get the kettle on.

41:32.420 --> 41:33.491
- This is so

41:34.353 --> 41:35.769
painful

41:35.769 --> 41:37.702
to be a day and a half in,

41:37.702 --> 41:39.738
no one has found the wreck yet.

41:39.738 --> 41:41.153
You know, there's
a whole team here,

41:41.153 --> 41:42.465
there's seven or eight people.

41:42.465 --> 41:43.708
We've all had to come together,

41:43.708 --> 41:45.123
we've all had to
get time off work.

41:45.123 --> 41:46.400
Everyone's you know,
descended on this one point,

41:46.400 --> 41:47.988
in this one week of the
year where we can do it.

41:47.988 --> 41:49.230
You know, they're
an amazing team,

41:49.230 --> 41:50.715
and they're so capable
of doing these things.

41:50.715 --> 41:52.717
But I wanna get involved
and I wanna help find it,

41:52.717 --> 41:54.546
but then there's not much
point me just sitting on a boat

41:54.546 --> 41:56.237
and getting seasick
with the rest of them.

41:56.237 --> 41:58.861
But I'm confident it will
figure itself out, you know.

41:58.861 --> 42:00.345
You've just gotta
keep going out there,

42:00.345 --> 42:02.899
and keep looking for it.
Which is easy for me to say,

42:02.899 --> 42:05.488
'cause I'm sat in a
warm house [laughs]

42:05.488 --> 42:06.869
waiting for them to tell me.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.155
Sounds like everything's
set up, ready to go.

42:17.155 --> 42:18.397
- Yeah, problem is-
- Everyone's geared up.

42:18.397 --> 42:19.951
- It's a bit lumpy out there.

42:19.951 --> 42:22.540
So looks fine here, but when
you get out to the open water-

42:22.540 --> 42:24.921
- Do you suffer
from seasickness?

42:24.921 --> 42:27.268
- We'll find out,
I suppose. [laughs]

42:27.268 --> 42:29.995
[engine revving]

42:29.995 --> 42:30.824
Good luck!

42:33.412 --> 42:34.724
And there's a lot more
pressure this time round,

42:34.724 --> 42:36.243
I feel like.

42:36.243 --> 42:38.728
Everyone's a bit on edge,
but they're optimistic.

42:38.728 --> 42:41.006
It's not just the location
that we've gotta do,

42:41.006 --> 42:42.214
we've gotta actually survey it.

42:42.214 --> 42:44.251
And we've got a
day and a half now,

42:44.251 --> 42:47.565
to try and identify the
wreck, which is pretty scary.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.222
Patrick gets here
tomorrow night.

42:50.222 --> 42:51.879
Tomorrow night,
Patrick gets here.

42:51.879 --> 42:53.674
He's here to see a dive trip.

42:53.674 --> 42:56.988
No one's been in the water
yet, they've been on the water.

42:56.988 --> 42:58.472
I don't make it out to
the dive team that much,

42:58.472 --> 43:00.612
but I'm pretty
stressed about it.

43:00.612 --> 43:03.442
[engine revving]

43:05.513 --> 43:06.618
- We're good.

43:06.618 --> 43:09.690
[light guitar music]

43:13.832 --> 43:16.317
- So yeah, I'm in Lion-sur-Mer
right now Patrick,

43:16.317 --> 43:17.836
on the seafront.
- Yeah.

43:17.836 --> 43:20.149
- I've just had a meeting
with the Mayor again,

43:20.149 --> 43:22.841
he's picked a spot for
the memorial to go.

43:22.841 --> 43:24.532
On the 6th of June this year,

43:24.532 --> 43:26.638
we're gonna unveil
the memorial here.

43:26.638 --> 43:27.950
So there's gonna be a band,

43:27.950 --> 43:30.055
there's gonna be the
Mayor, all of the town.

43:30.055 --> 43:33.058
- Crumbs!
- Crumbs, yeah. [laughs]

43:33.058 --> 43:34.784
We've got a date and
we've got a time,

43:34.784 --> 43:36.683
and it's all going ahead now.

43:36.683 --> 43:39.064
[Patrick laughs]

43:39.064 --> 43:39.996
Yeah, I know, I know.

43:39.996 --> 43:42.309
It's great, isn't it? [laughs]

43:42.309 --> 43:43.448
- Along side a mooring.

43:46.485 --> 43:49.972
- If you keep an eye
on the sonar here,

43:49.972 --> 43:53.803
as they come into the buoy
and use the wind as a break,

43:53.803 --> 43:56.668
you'll see that the rise up

43:56.668 --> 43:57.496
represents

43:58.912 --> 44:00.534
the target.

44:00.534 --> 44:01.949
It's just jumped up from...

44:01.949 --> 44:04.089
That's the highest
point we've seen so far.

44:07.748 --> 44:09.957
- We were desperate
to get in the water,

44:09.957 --> 44:12.373
and go down and dive it,
see what we could see.

44:12.373 --> 44:16.550
It was gonna be a disaster if
we hadn't have found anything.

44:18.725 --> 44:20.105
- Ready?

44:20.105 --> 44:21.589
Go!

44:21.589 --> 44:24.385
[water splashing]

44:28.355 --> 44:31.772
[light orchestral music]

44:35.189 --> 44:39.538
- We descended below
the murk of what is the

44:39.538 --> 44:40.470
warm river,

44:40.470 --> 44:42.403
coming down towards the sea bed.

44:42.403 --> 44:44.543
And then you see
this dark shape,

44:44.543 --> 44:47.685
and then you start to see
some features of the wreck.

44:49.031 --> 44:52.413
[light orchestral music]

45:00.663 --> 45:04.046
[water gurgling]

45:04.046 --> 45:07.394
[light orchestral music]

45:29.727 --> 45:31.004
It was

45:31.004 --> 45:33.696
a large lattice area,

45:33.696 --> 45:36.354
which looks to be sort
of the hull of the ship,

45:36.354 --> 45:41.290
all covered in fish, marine
life, starfish, scallops.

45:42.187 --> 45:44.155
Just really beautiful, actually.

45:45.363 --> 45:48.021
In another world,
it is another world.

45:49.470 --> 45:52.439
The wreck itself
was quite shocking.

45:52.439 --> 45:56.719
Quite shocking to see the
degree of destruction.

45:56.719 --> 46:00.136
There is a lot of very mangled,

46:00.136 --> 46:02.276
contorted metal.

46:02.276 --> 46:05.176
It was clear that it had
been quite badly damaged.

46:06.246 --> 46:09.180
[water bubbling]

46:09.180 --> 46:12.528
[light orchestral music]

46:21.571 --> 46:22.641
- Diver on the surface,

46:22.641 --> 46:23.953
it's Jim.
- Okay.

46:27.405 --> 46:29.994
[Jim laughing]

46:36.517 --> 46:39.348
[water trickling]

46:46.942 --> 46:48.529
- Good to get us back together,

46:48.529 --> 46:49.979
you must be pretty knackered.

46:49.979 --> 46:52.050
So, does someone wanna
run me through the dive?

46:52.050 --> 46:52.982
What happened [laughs]

46:52.982 --> 46:54.225
after that?

46:54.225 --> 46:55.813
- Oh, we just love to tease you.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.469
[both laughing]

46:57.469 --> 46:58.954
- Jaz went in first
and established a line.

47:00.507 --> 47:02.302
- I had the privilege of
being the first one down.

47:02.302 --> 47:05.512
We went along, there
was a lot of debris,

47:05.512 --> 47:07.894
and at about the distance
we expected to find the bow,

47:07.894 --> 47:10.862
we found a massive

47:10.862 --> 47:11.690
winch.

47:13.865 --> 47:16.212
- Okay, that's good right?

47:16.212 --> 47:17.420
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

47:17.420 --> 47:20.561
- This is the ditch,
and here's the center.

47:20.561 --> 47:21.977
- So, this is the
turret, the gun turret?

47:21.977 --> 47:24.496
- We think so, yeah.
- And that's the pedestal

47:24.496 --> 47:26.913
that it's sitting
on, but upside down.

47:26.913 --> 47:28.431
- The bow seems to
have disappeared,

47:28.431 --> 47:32.470
so that major clue which we
were looking for isn't there.

47:32.470 --> 47:33.747
This is part of the capstan,

47:33.747 --> 47:36.612
so you can see the sort
of capstan area here,

47:36.612 --> 47:38.717
so that-
- And that bit is the winch.

47:38.717 --> 47:41.997
When I saw the video of the
wreck for the first time,

47:41.997 --> 47:44.931
it was really, just surreal,

47:44.931 --> 47:46.173
because a year ago

47:46.173 --> 47:47.865
I didn't even know if
the wreck still existed.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.418
So, what was the deal
with the bow then?

47:49.418 --> 47:50.591
It just wasn't there at all

47:50.591 --> 47:51.627
when you got there, or-
- Well, we didn't-

47:51.627 --> 47:52.766
- Oh sorry, the stern.

47:52.766 --> 47:53.974
I meant the stern.

47:53.974 --> 47:55.458
This is the flat bit-
- So this is the-

47:55.458 --> 47:56.977
- You were talking about.
- Just a flat, smooth-

47:56.977 --> 47:58.496
- Yeah.
- Smooth area.

47:58.496 --> 48:00.187
- Would you think would
be the actual, the back?

48:00.187 --> 48:02.431
- Yeah, its an angle.
- The very back of it?

48:02.431 --> 48:04.364
- But I don't know, maybe
that's worth measuring,

48:04.364 --> 48:05.883
if you've got the exact-
- Yeah.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.194
- 'Cause it is, it's
got corners to it,

48:07.194 --> 48:08.851
so you would be able to measure

48:08.851 --> 48:11.474
the width of the transom
area you will have,

48:11.474 --> 48:13.235
the exact stern.

48:13.235 --> 48:14.892
You could measure that.

48:14.892 --> 48:16.583
- You know, it's a sad sight.

48:16.583 --> 48:19.103
It's in worse condition
than I could have pictured.

48:19.103 --> 48:21.899
The sonar doesn't
give you that imagery,

48:21.899 --> 48:24.349
it doesn't give you the
actual footage of the wreck,

48:24.349 --> 48:25.937
and I suppose I was
naive in thinking

48:25.937 --> 48:29.113
that it probably still
was at least metal.

48:29.113 --> 48:32.047
Well, it's not really
a ship anymore.

48:32.047 --> 48:34.704
- I called it the ultimate
sort of puzzle to find,

48:34.704 --> 48:37.915
it's real detective
stuff, it's real you know,

48:39.261 --> 48:41.056
trying to work things out.

48:41.056 --> 48:44.542
Something that was 70 odd
years ago and you're trying to,

48:44.542 --> 48:46.958
what does this bent
bit of metal mean?

48:46.958 --> 48:48.960
[laughs] It's quite a challenge.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.341
- I mean, I'm probably...

48:50.341 --> 48:51.790
Really what's going
through my head,

48:51.790 --> 48:53.827
is what Patrick would
think seeing this, I think.

48:55.104 --> 48:57.141
- [Alison] Are you
concerned how he'd feel, or?

48:59.246 --> 49:03.078
- I mean, not concerned
really, just...

49:03.078 --> 49:05.218
Well you don't you
how he'll react

49:07.427 --> 49:08.738
just seeing it, I guess.

49:08.738 --> 49:12.259
'Cause it is such
a mangled mess.

49:12.259 --> 49:13.502
- There doesn't look to be

49:13.502 --> 49:14.675
a lot of material-
- No, there doesn't.

49:14.675 --> 49:17.264
- Left on that picture.

49:17.264 --> 49:20.198
- We might get lucky, it might
just say LCH185 right there.

49:20.198 --> 49:22.787
[all laughing]

49:23.822 --> 49:27.171
[light orchestral music]

49:27.171 --> 49:28.241
[water splashing]

49:28.241 --> 49:31.692
[water gurgling]

49:31.692 --> 49:35.075
[light orchestral music]

49:56.338 --> 49:57.856
How did the measuring go, then?

49:57.856 --> 50:01.619
- We went down the
stern today and it was,

50:01.619 --> 50:03.414
it's definitely
upside down, the ship.

50:03.414 --> 50:04.967
So-
- Okay, yeah.

50:04.967 --> 50:06.003
- You can see

50:06.003 --> 50:08.488
the shape of the stern itself.

50:09.696 --> 50:11.215
Some of the plating's gone,

50:11.215 --> 50:13.562
but you can definitely still
see the outline of the shape.

50:13.562 --> 50:14.942
We went up to the winch

50:14.942 --> 50:17.221
and did a bit of photogrammetry
around there today,

50:17.221 --> 50:18.636
so-
- Brilliant.

50:18.636 --> 50:20.189
- [Martin] I'll run the pictures
quickly while we're out,

50:20.189 --> 50:21.259
and just see whether
there's any chance

50:21.259 --> 50:23.434
that those are lining up.

50:23.434 --> 50:25.367
It's all these little clues-
- Yeah, yeah.

50:25.367 --> 50:26.644
It's exciting-
- That come together-

50:26.644 --> 50:28.094
- For you guys to come back-
- You know.

50:28.094 --> 50:28.991
- And tell me these
things, it's really cool.

50:28.991 --> 50:30.337
- There's no real big stuff,

50:30.337 --> 50:31.925
but some of the smaller stuff

50:31.925 --> 50:33.996
when we actually of
piece it together,

50:33.996 --> 50:36.171
sometimes that'll be the final,

50:36.171 --> 50:37.551
"Well, it could only be this."

50:37.551 --> 50:39.036
- Yeah.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.761
[light orchestral music]

50:40.761 --> 50:44.524
- We've got an effective
width here of 7.9 meters.

50:45.732 --> 50:48.838
- It does seem to be too
narrow to be an LCT4,

50:48.838 --> 50:51.358
which was the landing craft gun.

50:51.358 --> 50:53.050
So those three there,

50:53.050 --> 50:55.535
match those three in the middle,

50:55.535 --> 50:59.332
match there three here,
which are the engine room.

50:59.332 --> 51:00.816
The puzzle is here.

51:02.093 --> 51:04.164
I'm nervous about
meeting Patrick.

51:06.235 --> 51:09.273
I know he's got a
great burning desire

51:09.273 --> 51:13.967
to find the ship where
his friends were lost,

51:13.967 --> 51:15.313
and I want to give him that.

51:17.177 --> 51:17.971
I do.

51:19.145 --> 51:20.974
I don't know if I can.

51:20.974 --> 51:25.012
And we've tried so hard
over the last few days,

51:25.012 --> 51:26.566
and

51:26.566 --> 51:28.568
some things line up,

51:28.568 --> 51:30.466
some things don't.

51:30.466 --> 51:33.814
And I can't give him
that answer just now,

51:33.814 --> 51:35.437
and

51:35.437 --> 51:36.921
I hope he's not disappointed.

51:39.337 --> 51:41.098
- Do you wanna come
in? Was the ferry good?

51:42.409 --> 51:44.549
- Oh yes, it was all right.

51:44.549 --> 51:46.103
- Good.
- Very smooth crossing.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.208
- Watch the step.
- Yes, I'll watch that.

51:50.348 --> 51:52.592
- There he is, the
man of the hour.

51:52.592 --> 51:53.489
- Hello.
- Hello.

51:54.456 --> 51:55.940
- Hello.
- Hello.

51:55.940 --> 51:57.493
- These are all the gentlemen?
- This is Patrick Thomas.

51:57.493 --> 51:58.908
- Hello, Patrick.
- Our friend, Pat.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.255
- Hello.
- Hello.

52:00.255 --> 52:02.912
- So, this is Jim.
- I don't remember, Jim is it?

52:02.912 --> 52:03.741
- Alison.

52:05.329 --> 52:06.571
Two.

52:06.571 --> 52:07.883
- Hello.

52:07.883 --> 52:09.264
- You could see he had
the glint in his eye,

52:09.264 --> 52:11.335
that John had warned me about.

52:13.923 --> 52:16.098
He's lovely, absolutely lovely.

52:17.064 --> 52:18.825
- Martin.
- Pardon?

52:18.825 --> 52:20.758
- Martin!
- Martin.

52:20.758 --> 52:22.139
- And I'm Doug.

52:22.139 --> 52:23.692
- He's quite a
character, I have to say.

52:23.692 --> 52:25.832
He is quite a character.

52:25.832 --> 52:28.524
- [laughs] Jolly, it's
nice this wine, isn't it?

52:28.524 --> 52:29.836
[all laughing]

52:29.836 --> 52:32.079
- These are all
the sonar images.

52:32.079 --> 52:33.184
- Oh!

52:33.184 --> 52:34.841
- That's you, yeah.
- Crumbs!

52:34.841 --> 52:36.981
- We've been here
about three days.

52:36.981 --> 52:39.397
We've found something.
- You did?

52:39.397 --> 52:41.192
- Yeah, but it's a
bit more complicated

52:41.192 --> 52:43.608
than we thought it would be.
- Oh.

52:43.608 --> 52:44.954
- We think

52:44.954 --> 52:47.716
the ship is upside down.

52:47.716 --> 52:48.958
- Oh.

52:48.958 --> 52:50.305
- [Alison] Which lines up with

52:50.305 --> 52:51.858
what you were saying.
- When she was turning

52:51.858 --> 52:52.686
like that.
- Yeah.

52:52.686 --> 52:55.344
- We've also found some

52:55.344 --> 52:56.483
particular

52:57.726 --> 53:00.798
parts of the ship that we think

53:00.798 --> 53:03.007
match 185,

53:03.007 --> 53:06.700
but then there are other
bits that maybe don't fit.

53:06.700 --> 53:09.703
But we're very willing
to share with you

53:09.703 --> 53:12.189
what we have found.
- Ooh, I'm bloody pleased,

53:12.189 --> 53:13.017
nevertheless.

53:13.017 --> 53:14.260
I'm grateful!

53:14.260 --> 53:16.641
- This is something
I've been creating

53:16.641 --> 53:18.919
from the wreckage.
- Is it?

53:18.919 --> 53:21.267
- We think this is an engine.

53:21.267 --> 53:23.614
We think this is a generator.

53:23.614 --> 53:26.651
And this is the winch
that was at the front.

53:26.651 --> 53:27.687
- [Patrick] Ah, yes.

53:27.687 --> 53:29.585
- These three items

53:30.586 --> 53:31.898
are very similar

53:31.898 --> 53:35.108
to the three items on
the plans of the ship,

53:35.108 --> 53:36.696
but we're still
looking at it yet.

53:36.696 --> 53:38.870
We need a bit more
information, yet.

53:38.870 --> 53:42.460
So we think this is
part of the stern area,

53:42.460 --> 53:45.014
so this is the
stern of the ship.

53:45.014 --> 53:47.154
- That's right, that's what
I would have said, yes.

53:47.154 --> 53:48.397
- [Martin] So it's quite narrow,

53:48.397 --> 53:49.881
but you can still
see some shape.

53:51.573 --> 53:54.955
[light orchestral music]

54:02.377 --> 54:04.655
I'm afraid the engines
have disappeared.

54:06.277 --> 54:09.660
[light orchestral music]

54:20.567 --> 54:21.499
- Where's...

54:21.499 --> 54:23.501
It's been so badly destroyed,

54:23.501 --> 54:25.710
you can hardly
recognize what it is.

54:26.884 --> 54:30.267
[light orchestral music]

54:36.169 --> 54:38.723
But I think it's so kind of you

54:38.723 --> 54:42.796
that you've all done
this you know, for me.

54:42.796 --> 54:44.177
Well, I feel it's for me

54:44.177 --> 54:46.662
and my shipmates.
- And your colleagues,

54:46.662 --> 54:47.456
that's right.

54:48.664 --> 54:50.252
- So you remember Patrick,

54:50.252 --> 54:52.910
tomorrow I'm going
to dive down on that.

54:52.910 --> 54:54.152
- [Patrick] Yes.

54:54.152 --> 54:55.326
- You gonna get
up nice and early,

54:55.326 --> 54:57.501
and come see me down
at the marina tomorrow?

54:57.501 --> 54:59.054
- Yes.

54:59.054 --> 55:01.436
Now you good folk wanna go
to bed surely, don't you?

55:01.436 --> 55:02.920
- We do.
- You wanna go off to bed.

55:02.920 --> 55:04.439
I'm gonna let you go.

55:04.439 --> 55:06.924
[John laughs]

55:09.513 --> 55:12.412
And I'll see you all again.
- Yes.

55:12.412 --> 55:16.589
Just meeting Patrick and
hearing his stories first hand,

55:16.589 --> 55:20.938
seeing how he still feels
that pain of what happened,

55:20.938 --> 55:23.975
still very vivid in his mind.

55:23.975 --> 55:25.977
- Right, okay chaps.

55:25.977 --> 55:27.738
- See you in the morning.
- See you!

55:27.738 --> 55:31.155
- Just helps reinforce why
it's important to do this.

55:39.784 --> 55:42.546
[engine revving]

55:50.657 --> 55:51.555
- Oh, lord.

55:56.422 --> 55:57.492
- So, how are you Patrick?

55:57.492 --> 55:59.217
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Yeah?

55:59.217 --> 56:01.219
So this is it, this
is the big moment.

56:01.219 --> 56:02.566
- At last we've made it.

56:02.566 --> 56:04.740
- It's not too late
to get you suited up,

56:04.740 --> 56:05.845
and come down.

56:05.845 --> 56:07.536
- Pardon?
- It's not too late!

56:07.536 --> 56:09.227
[both laughing]

56:09.227 --> 56:10.643
- You betcha.

56:10.643 --> 56:14.543
Oh my lord.

56:14.543 --> 56:17.443
[Patrick laughing]

56:19.893 --> 56:20.722
Crumbs.

56:27.625 --> 56:28.592
All success!

56:32.527 --> 56:34.908
[engine revving]

56:34.908 --> 56:36.496
- You'd take a lady by the hand?

56:38.049 --> 56:39.982
[all laughing]

56:39.982 --> 56:41.639
- I'm sure he would.

56:42.744 --> 56:44.539
- You know I'm on Facebook?

56:44.539 --> 56:47.300
[engine revving]

56:50.234 --> 56:52.995
[waves crashing]

57:03.558 --> 57:06.353
[waves splashing]

57:11.428 --> 57:14.189
[water gurgling]

57:14.189 --> 57:16.087
- The second I threw
myself into the sea,

57:16.087 --> 57:18.089
I think a wave just smashed
me straight in the face.

57:18.089 --> 57:20.195
And then suddenly, I mean
three miles out, right?

57:20.195 --> 57:22.162
So to go from going 10
meters off the shore

57:22.162 --> 57:23.612
to three miles out,

57:23.612 --> 57:25.649
and I'm suddenly at the
mercy of the English Channel.

57:25.649 --> 57:28.997
[light orchestral music]

57:47.015 --> 57:48.913
It was surreal, it was intense,

57:48.913 --> 57:51.433
and it was so much to take in.

57:52.952 --> 57:56.334
[light orchestral music]

58:27.676 --> 58:28.953
When we came back up,

58:28.953 --> 58:31.197
and I went up the ascent
line maybe five meters,

58:31.197 --> 58:34.925
and I look back thinking
the wreck would be gone,

58:34.925 --> 58:37.306
so I look back as if to be
like, "Okay, this is it.

58:37.306 --> 58:38.549
I've done it."

58:38.549 --> 58:41.725
And it was still there,
so that threw me off.

58:41.725 --> 58:43.450
So I went up another meter,

58:43.450 --> 58:45.280
turned back thinking it
would still be there,

58:45.280 --> 58:46.488
and then it was gone.

58:46.488 --> 58:48.455
So then, that took
me by surprise.

58:48.455 --> 58:51.735
[water bubbling]

58:51.735 --> 58:54.392
- Richard will grab hold of you.

58:55.704 --> 58:59.121
[light orchestral music]

59:19.901 --> 59:22.179
- John.
- I did it!

59:22.179 --> 59:23.629
- You've done well
to get on with it.

59:23.629 --> 59:25.700
- Yeah, good, good.
- Good-o, good-o.

59:25.700 --> 59:27.218
- I was quite taken aback

59:27.218 --> 59:29.773
by how much like a boat
it actually is, you know.

59:29.773 --> 59:31.878
You can still travel down it.

59:32.845 --> 59:34.398
It's big.

59:34.398 --> 59:36.711
The images don't really do
justice to how big it is,

59:36.711 --> 59:38.436
it is big down there.

59:38.436 --> 59:40.991
It's peaceful, it's
peaceful down there.

59:40.991 --> 59:41.819
- Never...

59:43.338 --> 59:46.617
I never thought this sort
of thing would ever happen,

59:46.617 --> 59:47.825
not to me.

59:47.825 --> 59:50.207
- Do you feel like
us being here,

59:50.207 --> 59:53.072
finding the target
and diving it,

59:53.072 --> 59:54.798
and you being here,

59:54.798 --> 59:57.697
is that any sense
of a full circle?

59:57.697 --> 59:59.216
- It is in that sense.

59:59.216 --> 1:00:01.943
I never thought I
would react like this.

1:00:04.186 --> 1:00:05.912
- [John] It's a
lot to take in, eh?

1:00:07.534 --> 1:00:08.466
- Ah, well.

1:00:14.196 --> 1:00:16.751
[Patrick sobs]

1:00:40.153 --> 1:00:42.708
- Go and sit down?
- Yeah, okay.

1:00:47.989 --> 1:00:49.991
- Just, I dunno.

1:00:49.991 --> 1:00:52.131
Was it the right thing to do?

1:00:52.131 --> 1:00:52.959
I dunno.

1:00:54.064 --> 1:00:55.306
I think it's close,

1:00:55.306 --> 1:00:57.412
I think he's happy
about it, but...

1:01:03.245 --> 1:01:04.626
- After all these years.

1:01:08.388 --> 1:01:09.182
What, 74.

1:01:11.115 --> 1:01:12.082
Very nearly.

1:01:16.086 --> 1:01:19.503
And they've brought it all
to the surface now I think,

1:01:19.503 --> 1:01:21.091
oh fiddle-de-dee.

1:01:21.091 --> 1:01:24.473
[light orchestral music]

1:01:26.130 --> 1:01:27.649
And,

1:01:27.649 --> 1:01:28.477
oh dear.

1:01:29.582 --> 1:01:33.517
Anyway, I'm so pleased
you've done this.

1:01:35.036 --> 1:01:38.833
And it's great to think
that all you people

1:01:38.833 --> 1:01:40.489
have taken such an interest.

1:01:41.387 --> 1:01:43.734
I never thought they would.

1:01:43.734 --> 1:01:45.011
- There's moments
along this journey

1:01:45.011 --> 1:01:47.600
where Patrick has
gotten quite upset,

1:01:49.878 --> 1:01:51.121
which is understandable.

1:01:51.121 --> 1:01:53.882
It's a lot of memories
that you're churning up,

1:01:53.882 --> 1:01:55.988
and I've always
been aware of that.

1:01:55.988 --> 1:01:58.059
And there's moments where
he's quiet and contemplative,

1:01:58.059 --> 1:02:00.613
and I'm a worrier,
so I always think,

1:02:00.613 --> 1:02:02.684
"Oh god, should I have
done any of this?"

1:02:02.684 --> 1:02:04.824
Is kind of the thing
I always think,

1:02:04.824 --> 1:02:07.378
because Patrick's very
quiet in the moment,

1:02:07.378 --> 1:02:11.520
but then I know he thinks
about it and he appreciates it.

1:02:12.729 --> 1:02:16.077
[light orchestral music]

1:02:20.460 --> 1:02:22.739
- He was aged 29

1:02:22.739 --> 1:02:25.155
and I was 19,

1:02:25.155 --> 1:02:26.708
but I remember him well.

1:02:28.917 --> 1:02:31.368
And I think now I
should lay this wreath.

1:02:31.368 --> 1:02:33.888
- Well, I wanna
give you this first.

1:02:35.061 --> 1:02:37.926
I managed to track
down Jack's family.

1:02:37.926 --> 1:02:39.686
- You have done?
- Yeah.

1:02:39.686 --> 1:02:41.205
- Crumbs!

1:02:41.205 --> 1:02:43.829
- [John] I managed to track
down Les Barringer's children.

1:02:43.829 --> 1:02:44.657
- Have you?

1:02:44.657 --> 1:02:46.176
Les is dead, is he?

1:02:46.176 --> 1:02:47.902
- [John] He is, but his
children are still alive,

1:02:47.902 --> 1:02:50.352
and they're very interested
in what you've been doing.

1:02:50.352 --> 1:02:51.629
- Yes.

1:02:51.629 --> 1:02:52.941
- And they gave me
this, it's a letter.

1:02:52.941 --> 1:02:54.184
You don't have to read it now,

1:02:54.184 --> 1:02:56.151
you can read it
in your own time,

1:02:56.151 --> 1:03:00.500
but it's a letter
written from LCH185

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:01.881
from Jack to Les,

1:03:01.881 --> 1:03:04.470
about 10 days
before the sinking.

1:03:04.470 --> 1:03:06.713
And it talks about D Day,

1:03:06.713 --> 1:03:08.854
and it talks about their
family back at home,

1:03:08.854 --> 1:03:12.754
so I wanted you to have it
and read it in your own time.

1:03:12.754 --> 1:03:13.651
- Crumbs.
- Yeah.

1:03:15.101 --> 1:03:17.034
- Thank you.
- That's okay.

1:03:18.933 --> 1:03:20.210
They wanted you-
- Marvelous.

1:03:20.210 --> 1:03:22.108
- [John] The family
wanted you to have it.

1:03:22.108 --> 1:03:23.869
- They did?
- Yeah.

1:03:23.869 --> 1:03:25.215
- Shall we go and place this-

1:03:25.215 --> 1:03:26.561
- Yes, I think we ought to.

1:03:26.561 --> 1:03:28.149
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1:03:28.149 --> 1:03:31.531
[light orchestral music]

1:03:50.516 --> 1:03:51.862
Get your feet right.

1:03:51.862 --> 1:03:54.520
[John laughing]

1:03:55.521 --> 1:03:57.143
Up right!
- Up right.

1:03:57.143 --> 1:03:59.697
- [Patrick] Chest out and not
bending your blasting back.

1:03:59.697 --> 1:04:02.942
[John and Patrick laughing]

1:04:02.942 --> 1:04:05.842
[bagpipes blaring]

1:04:14.678 --> 1:04:17.750
[footsteps marching]

1:04:19.234 --> 1:04:22.134
[bagpipes blaring]

1:04:28.623 --> 1:04:31.005
- The first time I ever
learnt about Patrick's story

1:04:31.005 --> 1:04:34.077
was stood at the grave
of Jack Barringer,

1:04:34.077 --> 1:04:38.012
and that's the name that's
always been told by Patrick,

1:04:38.012 --> 1:04:39.841
that's the big
part of the story.

1:04:39.841 --> 1:04:41.463
And I remember saying
to him once you know,

1:04:41.463 --> 1:04:43.120
"What if I could find them?"

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:45.812
Patrick, I've got some people
you might like to meet.

1:04:45.812 --> 1:04:47.918
- Yes, okay.
- I'll bring them in.

1:04:47.918 --> 1:04:49.851
- I'll meet them.

1:04:49.851 --> 1:04:51.025
- John?

1:04:51.025 --> 1:04:52.889
- This is Jack
Barringer's family.

1:04:52.889 --> 1:04:54.062
- You remember Les-
- Is it?

1:04:54.062 --> 1:04:55.615
- You remember Les Barringer?

1:04:55.615 --> 1:04:57.652
- Yes!
- I'm his son.

1:04:57.652 --> 1:04:58.929
- Are you?

1:04:58.929 --> 1:05:00.068
- Yes, and I'm very
pleased to meet you.

1:05:00.068 --> 1:05:02.899
Also, John was Jack's-
- Hello, John.

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:04.141
- Jack's brother.

1:05:04.141 --> 1:05:06.592
- Oh, and Jack's brother?
- Yep.

1:05:06.592 --> 1:05:07.800
- What did you serve on?

1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:09.008
- Tiptoe.

1:05:09.008 --> 1:05:10.907
- Oh, I remember Tiptoe!

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:12.149
[all laughing]

1:05:12.149 --> 1:05:13.875
- Buckingham Palace,
they used to call it.

1:05:13.875 --> 1:05:16.360
- Sorry, have we
been introduced?

1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:18.017
- No, I'm Jeff's wife.

1:05:18.017 --> 1:05:19.639
- Oh, I see.
- Nice to meet you.

1:05:19.639 --> 1:05:20.847
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1:05:20.847 --> 1:05:22.780
- Has an eye for
the ladies, you see.

1:05:22.780 --> 1:05:23.850
- Yes, he does.

1:05:23.850 --> 1:05:25.956
[all laughing]

1:05:25.956 --> 1:05:28.648
- Well, this is a
pleasant surprise.

1:05:28.648 --> 1:05:30.167
- Jack's bro...

1:05:30.167 --> 1:05:31.651
- Yep.
- Brother?

1:05:31.651 --> 1:05:33.550
- Jack was the eldest.
- Oh, Jack was the eldest.

1:05:33.550 --> 1:05:35.345
- George was next.
- George.

1:05:35.345 --> 1:05:36.863
- Les, Keith.
- Yes.

1:05:38.210 --> 1:05:39.245
And then me.

1:05:39.245 --> 1:05:40.453
- And then you.

1:05:40.453 --> 1:05:42.455
I always went to Ranville.
- Yes.

1:05:42.455 --> 1:05:47.081
- And I always laid
something on Jack's grave.

1:05:47.081 --> 1:05:49.221
- We saw, we were
there this morning,

1:05:49.221 --> 1:05:51.257
and we saw your tribute-

1:05:51.257 --> 1:05:52.362
- That's right.
- This morning, at the grave.

1:05:52.362 --> 1:05:54.295
Yes, thank you.

1:05:54.295 --> 1:05:55.952
- So how old were
you at the time?

1:05:55.952 --> 1:05:57.091
- 19.

1:05:57.091 --> 1:05:58.092
- Wow, yes.

1:05:58.092 --> 1:05:59.886
19, so young.

1:05:59.886 --> 1:06:01.336
- Green as they come.

1:06:01.336 --> 1:06:03.787
I tell you what, I
grew up very quickly.

1:06:03.787 --> 1:06:04.891
- [laughs] I bet you did.

1:06:04.891 --> 1:06:06.617
- After that.

1:06:06.617 --> 1:06:09.068
- There was a moment
where Patrick turned
to me in Ranville,

1:06:09.068 --> 1:06:11.691
at the end of the dive trip.

1:06:12.554 --> 1:06:13.659
And he said to me,

1:06:15.178 --> 1:06:18.146
185 for him has always
been a sad story.

1:06:18.146 --> 1:06:19.389
He said, and now
it's a happy thing,

1:06:19.389 --> 1:06:21.908
because I know that people know

1:06:21.908 --> 1:06:24.532
that I'm here telling
the story, as in Patrick.

1:06:24.532 --> 1:06:27.880
And Patrick knows that these
families haven't forgotten,

1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:29.295
and he never knew that.

1:06:29.295 --> 1:06:30.503
And so, if one good
thing's come out of this

1:06:30.503 --> 1:06:32.057
other than the memorial,

1:06:32.057 --> 1:06:36.199
it's been Patrick knowing that
these families never forgot.

1:06:36.199 --> 1:06:38.028
Which I think had been lost,

1:06:38.028 --> 1:06:39.581
and would never have been found

1:06:39.581 --> 1:06:42.895
if we hadn't have
promised him we'd find it.

1:07:40.297 --> 1:07:41.333
- Bonjour, le Maire.

1:07:42.541 --> 1:07:43.818
My thanks to you for
your moving words,

1:07:43.818 --> 1:07:46.200
and for hosting this
special event today.

1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:47.718
The list of
casualties totals 34,

1:07:47.718 --> 1:07:50.135
but it is likely much higher.

1:07:50.135 --> 1:07:53.241
Just a handful, less than
10, survived that day,

1:07:53.241 --> 1:07:56.037
and now 74 years later,
only one remains.

1:07:56.037 --> 1:07:58.004
My friend, Patrick Thomas.

1:07:58.004 --> 1:08:00.248
Of all the men that lost
their lives that day,

1:08:00.248 --> 1:08:02.492
only four were ever
given a burial.

1:08:02.492 --> 1:08:04.494
The rest were lost to the sea.

1:08:04.494 --> 1:08:05.909
Now with this memorial,

1:08:05.909 --> 1:08:07.669
the crew will be
remembered forever.

1:08:09.085 --> 1:08:10.016
- Bonjour, le Maire.

1:08:10.016 --> 1:08:12.260
My grateful thanks for your help

1:08:12.260 --> 1:08:15.953
in providing locating the
prints at Lion-sur-Mer

1:08:15.953 --> 1:08:20.924
for the the memorial dedicated
to those lost on LCH185,

1:08:22.650 --> 1:08:25.618
on the 25th of June, 1944.

1:08:27.172 --> 1:08:30.071
I was fortunate
to have survived.

1:08:30.071 --> 1:08:32.763
185 was my home,

1:08:32.763 --> 1:08:35.835
and my shipmates my family.

1:08:35.835 --> 1:08:39.494
I am proud and honored
to unveil the monument

1:08:39.494 --> 1:08:40.288
commemorating

1:08:41.358 --> 1:08:43.878
the tragic loss of 185,

1:08:43.878 --> 1:08:47.537
and all who lost their
lives aboard her.

1:08:47.537 --> 1:08:51.196
My grateful thanks
to all who are here

1:08:51.196 --> 1:08:53.405
to witness the dedication.

1:08:53.405 --> 1:08:56.994
My shipmates will be
remembered for all time

1:08:56.994 --> 1:08:59.031
by the memorial.

1:08:59.031 --> 1:09:03.587
"There are no roses
on sailor's graves,

1:09:03.587 --> 1:09:06.832
nor wreaths upon the
storm tossed waves.

1:09:07.971 --> 1:09:12.355
No heartbroken words
carved in stone,

1:09:12.355 --> 1:09:14.978

lying there alone.

The only tributes are
the seagulls sweeps,

1:09:20.984 --> 1:09:23.918
and the teardrops when
a loved one weeps."

have no other grave,

than the sea off Normandy.

1:11:15.029 --> 1:11:17.273
- Just off, slightly off.
- Just off that way.

1:11:17.273 --> 1:11:19.136
- There.
- That way.

1:11:19.136 --> 1:11:20.379
Oh, I see.

1:11:20.379 --> 1:11:23.658
And people can see it
when I'm long gone,

1:11:25.177 --> 1:11:28.801
and the memorial will be
there when I'm long gone.

1:11:30.286 --> 1:11:31.148
That's marvelous.

1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:35.808
[uplifting orchestral music]

1:11:48.580 --> 1:11:51.099
- [Alison] Lovely
to see you again.

1:11:51.099 --> 1:11:52.549
- It's flown by,

1:11:52.549 --> 1:11:53.378
the last few weeks.
- It has!

1:11:53.378 --> 1:11:54.310
- Good to see you again.

1:11:54.310 --> 1:11:55.483
- Yeah, nice to see you again.

1:11:55.483 --> 1:11:57.140
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you again.

1:11:57.140 --> 1:11:58.314
We're all back together, eh?

1:11:58.314 --> 1:11:59.245
Isn't this great.

1:11:59.245 --> 1:12:00.868
- So the details measurements

1:12:00.868 --> 1:12:03.353
that Doug and Jim

1:12:03.353 --> 1:12:06.183
took of the framework
in particular,

1:12:07.461 --> 1:12:10.464
are probably one
of the one things

1:12:10.464 --> 1:12:12.155
that's going to
give us the answer.

1:12:12.155 --> 1:12:12.983
- [John] Yeah.

1:12:12.983 --> 1:12:14.537
- The width was 7.95.

1:12:15.572 --> 1:12:16.746
And

1:12:16.746 --> 1:12:18.195
from that

1:12:18.195 --> 1:12:19.680
video,

1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:23.994
we saw that there was evidence
of an extra width to it,

1:12:23.994 --> 1:12:27.343
so it could have been
even wider than the 7.95.

1:12:28.516 --> 1:12:31.450
The rest of what we
are gonna look at now,

1:12:31.450 --> 1:12:32.278
is

1:12:33.210 --> 1:12:35.212
reinforcing the fact

1:12:35.212 --> 1:12:38.250
that this is probably
not Patrick's ship.

1:12:38.250 --> 1:12:42.358
[light orchestral music]

1:12:42.358 --> 1:12:44.601
- The second they told me the
measurements, I thought...

1:12:44.601 --> 1:12:47.224
I mean, it was obvious
it wasn't gonna be 185,

1:12:47.224 --> 1:12:50.780
'cause when we were in
France on the expedition,

1:12:50.780 --> 1:12:54.162
it started to seem like the
measurements weren't adding up.

1:12:54.162 --> 1:12:56.130
And you know, an archeology
measurements are everything.

1:12:56.130 --> 1:12:58.477
And the width of it was wider

1:12:58.477 --> 1:12:59.892
than 185

1:12:59.892 --> 1:13:01.446
was,

1:13:01.446 --> 1:13:03.586
and things can be smaller
on the bottom of the ocean,

1:13:03.586 --> 1:13:05.070
because they can
degrade and fall apart,

1:13:05.070 --> 1:13:06.416
but things can't be bigger.

1:13:07.452 --> 1:13:10.282
- A landing craft 4

1:13:10.282 --> 1:13:12.664
had four sections in the middle,

1:13:14.976 --> 1:13:17.979
and then two on the outside.

1:13:17.979 --> 1:13:20.534
The measurement across
here, these four,

1:13:22.087 --> 1:13:22.881
is

1:13:22.881 --> 1:13:24.469
pretty much

1:13:24.469 --> 1:13:25.262
7.95.

1:13:26.678 --> 1:13:29.301
- I have to say, I was
quite 50/50 in Normandy.

1:13:29.301 --> 1:13:31.855
I thought that the
winch arrangements

1:13:31.855 --> 1:13:33.857
could well have been part of it,

1:13:33.857 --> 1:13:36.619
but in real conclusion,

1:13:36.619 --> 1:13:40.243
you know, the measurements on
the frame just don't add up.

1:13:40.243 --> 1:13:43.211
- You don't really
get surprised,

1:13:43.211 --> 1:13:45.421
until you know the
entire picture.

1:13:45.421 --> 1:13:47.008
Working in maritime archeology,

1:13:47.008 --> 1:13:50.149
you have to
appreciate the chances

1:13:50.149 --> 1:13:52.393
of identifying a
wreck conclusively,

1:13:52.393 --> 1:13:54.084
are always going to be slim.

1:13:54.084 --> 1:13:58.364
And just because a wreck matches
the details that you know

1:13:58.364 --> 1:13:59.607
from the historical record,

1:13:59.607 --> 1:14:01.609
doesn't meant that
it's definitely it.

1:14:01.609 --> 1:14:04.888
Normandy was a very busy
place in the summer of 1944,

1:14:04.888 --> 1:14:06.752
numerous vessels were lost.

1:14:06.752 --> 1:14:08.547
- And the other thing we noticed

1:14:08.547 --> 1:14:11.654
was that landing craft infantry,

1:14:11.654 --> 1:14:12.896
or landing craft headquarters,

1:14:12.896 --> 1:14:16.452
didn't have ladders
into that bottom area.

1:14:16.452 --> 1:14:19.696
They did have them on
the landing craft guns.

1:14:19.696 --> 1:14:23.010
It could be one of three
landing craft guns,

1:14:23.010 --> 1:14:25.564
but we have at least got
some photographs of it.

1:14:25.564 --> 1:14:27.117
- Oh yeah, that's amazing.

1:14:27.117 --> 1:14:29.603
That was amazing, and you
guys have worked so hard.

1:14:29.603 --> 1:14:32.537
I mean, I'm totally blow
away by the level of detail

1:14:32.537 --> 1:14:34.884
you've put into
proving that it's not.

1:14:34.884 --> 1:14:36.782
And like I said,

1:14:36.782 --> 1:14:39.371
it's one more rock you've
looked under, right?

1:14:39.371 --> 1:14:43.237
I mean, so it's one
more thing to knock off

1:14:43.237 --> 1:14:44.687
that it's not LCH.

1:14:45.653 --> 1:14:46.930
We've identified
a landing craft,

1:14:46.930 --> 1:14:47.966
and it was someone's home,

1:14:47.966 --> 1:14:49.381
and it was someone's boat,

1:14:49.381 --> 1:14:51.038
and it was someone's story.

1:14:51.038 --> 1:14:52.488
And there's people out there

1:14:52.488 --> 1:14:53.799
who's family members
served on it.

1:14:53.799 --> 1:14:54.731
There's probably
people out there

1:14:54.731 --> 1:14:56.906
who's family members died on it.

1:14:56.906 --> 1:14:59.046
And it's another
part of bring closure

1:14:59.046 --> 1:15:01.324
to these forgotten
stories, you know?

1:15:01.324 --> 1:15:03.913
- There is still another
wreck here to identify,

1:15:03.913 --> 1:15:06.881
and that's another interesting
piece of research in itself.

1:15:06.881 --> 1:15:09.815
This is has its own story,
this had its own crew,

1:15:09.815 --> 1:15:11.990
and this is another
story just as valuable,

1:15:11.990 --> 1:15:13.405
and equally worth telling.

1:15:13.405 --> 1:15:15.821
- Well there is a ray of hope,

1:15:15.821 --> 1:15:19.722
in that we're out to
Normandy again in July.

1:15:19.722 --> 1:15:22.966
We have permission to
dive a number of wrecks,

1:15:22.966 --> 1:15:26.625
but one of the sites we
have asked to look at,

1:15:27.730 --> 1:15:30.871
is labeled as the Lord Austin,

1:15:30.871 --> 1:15:31.699
which was

1:15:32.597 --> 1:15:34.288
a trawler.

1:15:34.288 --> 1:15:38.706
But the multi-beam looks
like it's a landing craft,

1:15:38.706 --> 1:15:42.089
so it may well be
wrongly identified.

1:15:42.089 --> 1:15:44.643
And who knows, it
may well be that.

1:15:44.643 --> 1:15:46.231
- You'll have to let me know.
- We just keep going.

1:15:46.231 --> 1:15:48.371
- [laughs] Keep climbing on.

1:15:48.371 --> 1:15:50.166
- We just keep going.

1:15:50.166 --> 1:15:52.686
You can't argue with the facts,

1:15:52.686 --> 1:15:55.620
and you're in danger of
coming away disappointed,

1:15:55.620 --> 1:15:57.932
when actually you
have succeeded.

1:15:57.932 --> 1:16:02.558
We've succeeded in identifying
this as a landing craft gun.

1:16:02.558 --> 1:16:05.526
Yes, it's not LCH185,

1:16:05.526 --> 1:16:08.909
but at least now it is known,

1:16:08.909 --> 1:16:10.842
and we can move
onto the next one,

1:16:10.842 --> 1:16:12.568
and find the next
one, and the next one.

1:16:12.568 --> 1:16:15.916
- I think Patrick
probably should know,

1:16:17.296 --> 1:16:18.643
right or wrong,

1:16:18.643 --> 1:16:20.403
whether we've done it or not,

1:16:20.403 --> 1:16:21.231
but

1:16:22.888 --> 1:16:24.096
I don't know.

1:16:24.096 --> 1:16:27.859
Having gone through the
process of you know,

1:16:27.859 --> 1:16:31.690
paying your respects
to your comrades fallen

1:16:31.690 --> 1:16:33.968
that have already
been there, then...

1:16:36.695 --> 1:16:38.110
I don't know, it's difficult.

1:16:39.629 --> 1:16:42.114
- I think I probably would

1:16:43.771 --> 1:16:44.772
want to know,

1:16:48.742 --> 1:16:49.881
but

1:16:49.881 --> 1:16:51.676
it's a tough call, I think.

1:17:10.487 --> 1:17:12.524
- Here we are again.

1:17:12.524 --> 1:17:15.872
I've gotta tell you
something, basically.

1:17:15.872 --> 1:17:18.219
I've got some news for you.
- Yes?

1:17:19.807 --> 1:17:21.947
- When we did the
dive on the wreck,

1:17:23.293 --> 1:17:27.056
we thought, we weren't
sure what wreck it was.

1:17:28.747 --> 1:17:32.475
And there was always
a possibility that
it might not be 185,

1:17:32.475 --> 1:17:35.167
or that we wouldn't
be able to tell.

1:17:35.167 --> 1:17:37.653
And when the dive team
did all the measurements,

1:17:37.653 --> 1:17:39.447
and all that sort of stuff.
- Yes.

1:17:39.447 --> 1:17:43.037
- It turns out that it was
actually a landing craft gun,

1:17:43.037 --> 1:17:44.452
rather than an LCH,

1:17:46.972 --> 1:17:48.491
and it came as a big surprise.

1:17:49.665 --> 1:17:53.185
We still discovered
this landing craft gun

1:17:53.185 --> 1:17:54.704
which had its own story,

1:17:54.704 --> 1:17:57.811
and that had sailors lose
their lives on it as well.

1:17:57.811 --> 1:18:00.917
So it was someone's wreck,
it was someone's story,

1:18:00.917 --> 1:18:02.781
but it wasn't 185's.

1:18:02.781 --> 1:18:04.576
We don't know where it is.

1:18:04.576 --> 1:18:06.060
- Oh!

1:18:06.060 --> 1:18:09.857
- And that probably means that
185 hasn't been disturbed.

1:18:10.789 --> 1:18:12.998
- The sea is never still.

1:18:12.998 --> 1:18:14.241
And of course,

1:18:14.241 --> 1:18:16.622
everything's shifting
all the time,

1:18:16.622 --> 1:18:19.142
and the sand drifts over things.

1:18:20.316 --> 1:18:21.524
And so eventually you know,

1:18:21.524 --> 1:18:25.321
it'll be a war grave
and they're undisturbed.

1:18:25.321 --> 1:18:29.705
That ship at that particular
time is your home, was my home.

1:18:31.189 --> 1:18:34.330
And of course, the crew
are part of your family.

1:18:34.330 --> 1:18:35.849
- Yeah.

1:18:35.849 --> 1:18:39.197
- But I always thought that
people are not interested,

1:18:39.197 --> 1:18:43.201
it's in the past, it's ancient
history to a lot of people.

1:18:44.512 --> 1:18:46.204
But it's still very vivid to me.

1:18:46.204 --> 1:18:48.862
Never, ever thought
it would happen to me,

1:18:48.862 --> 1:18:50.587
but it's through your efforts.

1:18:50.587 --> 1:18:52.106
It's through meeting you.

1:18:52.106 --> 1:18:54.937
- Just 'cause I had nowhere
to stay in France, did I?

1:18:54.937 --> 1:18:56.145
- Oh, that's right.

1:18:56.145 --> 1:18:58.906
- It wasn't just me that
pulled all this off,

1:18:58.906 --> 1:19:02.530
there was obviously you
know, the dive team.

1:19:02.530 --> 1:19:04.532
There was the lifeboat crew.
- Yes.

1:19:04.532 --> 1:19:06.396
- There was the historians.

1:19:06.396 --> 1:19:08.364
There was the Mayor.

1:19:08.364 --> 1:19:10.780
There was all the
people of Lion.

1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:12.299
I just feel really grateful

1:19:12.299 --> 1:19:14.784
that you've given me the
chance to tell this story

1:19:14.784 --> 1:19:16.682
to so many people,

1:19:16.682 --> 1:19:19.409
because I think it's
touched a lot of people.

1:19:19.409 --> 1:19:21.757
And it's really brought
to light you know,

1:19:21.757 --> 1:19:23.862
what you did, and
what your friends did.

1:19:25.070 --> 1:19:28.453
And without you allowing
me to tell that story,

1:19:28.453 --> 1:19:31.421
but I couldn't have done
it without you, Pat.

1:19:31.421 --> 1:19:33.320
- And I couldn't have
done it without you!

1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:34.666
[John laughing]

1:19:34.666 --> 1:19:36.392
'Cause you know my
last words were,

1:19:39.429 --> 1:19:40.776
rest in peace

1:19:42.122 --> 1:19:44.296
all those that
have no other grave

1:19:44.296 --> 1:19:46.471
but the sea in Normandy.

1:19:48.749 --> 1:19:51.717
Somebody said to me,
I'm living history.

1:19:51.717 --> 1:19:54.790
See I'm not old, I'm ancient.

1:19:54.790 --> 1:19:56.377
[John laughing]

1:19:56.377 --> 1:19:57.862
So, there you are.

1:19:59.104 --> 1:20:01.658
Over all these years of course,

1:20:03.246 --> 1:20:04.765
I've never given a thought

1:20:05.870 --> 1:20:06.871
about 185.

1:20:09.252 --> 1:20:10.322
It wasn't until

1:20:11.220 --> 1:20:14.188
I came to Normandy in 2013,

1:20:14.188 --> 1:20:16.950
to see Jack Barringer's grave.

1:20:16.950 --> 1:20:21.920
And having visited that,
it resurrected memories.

1:20:22.818 --> 1:20:24.820
You can't live in the past,

1:20:24.820 --> 1:20:26.235
but I like history

1:20:27.408 --> 1:20:29.790
because it's quite simple.

1:20:29.790 --> 1:20:32.413
People learn from history.

1:20:32.413 --> 1:20:34.899
There are other
stories to be told

1:20:36.935 --> 1:20:38.972
on land, sea and air,

1:20:40.387 --> 1:20:43.045
and probably many that
will never be told.

1:20:44.184 --> 1:20:45.910
Well, this memorial

1:20:47.290 --> 1:20:49.327
is a memorial

1:20:49.327 --> 1:20:51.329
for a particular ship,

1:20:52.882 --> 1:20:54.642
not generalizing.

1:20:55.851 --> 1:20:57.231
It was one

1:20:57.231 --> 1:21:00.200
for LCH185,

1:21:00.200 --> 1:21:01.718
one ship

1:21:01.718 --> 1:21:02.927
and its crew.

1:21:03.859 --> 1:21:04.998
And as I said

1:21:06.068 --> 1:21:07.138
in my speech,

1:21:08.208 --> 1:21:10.762
that the crew were my family.

1:21:12.937 --> 1:21:15.732
I mean, I've gazed
on memorials before.

1:21:19.115 --> 1:21:21.842
I can only say it's
an emotional moment.

1:21:22.912 --> 1:21:24.362
Once in a while,

1:21:25.673 --> 1:21:27.434
your thoughts can go back,

1:21:29.608 --> 1:21:31.438
and mine went back
all those years.

1:21:34.406 --> 1:21:35.718
I saw the sea,

1:21:36.892 --> 1:21:38.065
an empty sea.

1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:41.655
But when I was here,

1:21:42.483 --> 1:21:44.071
that sea

1:21:44.071 --> 1:21:45.452
was full of ships

1:21:46.660 --> 1:21:48.248
and landing craft.

1:21:56.152 --> 1:21:58.948
[waves splashing]

1:22:01.226 --> 1:22:04.781
[mellow orchestral music]
