00:58.658 --> 01:00.424
I remember before I was born...

01:00.426 --> 01:02.592
Wadded up like
a fur ball in the

01:02.594 --> 01:04.226
highly overrated
fetal position.

01:04.227 --> 01:05.860
Luckily, I'm not
claustrophobic,

01:05.862 --> 01:09.763
but on rainy days I feel a
tightness in my left shoulder.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.631
Now that
my stepmother's pregnant,

01:11.633 --> 01:13.633
I understand what
the baby's going through.

01:13.635 --> 01:17.637
And I'm not jealous at all.
Really... not at all!

01:17.639 --> 01:21.741
- You're not eating your meat loaf.
- I'll throw up.

01:21.743 --> 01:23.375
At least try a little bit.

01:23.377 --> 01:25.110
Then I'll throw up
a little bit.

01:25.112 --> 01:29.314
Are you sure you want
to get involved in this?

01:44.129 --> 01:47.230
<i>¶ Sunshine through them</i>

01:47.232 --> 01:54.170
<i>¶ fiery gems for you</i>

01:54.172 --> 02:00.843
<i>¶ only for you</i>

02:00.845 --> 02:03.712
<i>¶ our house</i>

02:03.714 --> 02:07.248
<i>¶ is a very, very, very</i>
<i>fine house</i>

02:07.250 --> 02:10.050
<i>¶ with two cats in the yard</i>

02:10.051 --> 02:13.620
<i>¶ life used to be so hard</i>

02:13.622 --> 02:19.892
<i>¶ now everything is easy</i>
<i>'cause of you</i>

02:21.028 --> 02:21.528
<i>¶ ¶</i>

02:27.300 --> 02:29.433
vada, scrunch
these chairs together.

02:29.435 --> 02:31.802
Dad, they're chairs.
They don't scrunch.

02:31.804 --> 02:34.204
I'll get it!

02:34.206 --> 02:38.641
We'll set up more chairs in the
library and pipe the sermon in.

02:38.643 --> 02:43.178
Better fix that speaker. Makes the
minister sound like an astronaut.

02:43.180 --> 02:44.646
- Hello, Judy.
- Hi, Arthur.

02:44.648 --> 02:48.049
- Hi, Judy! Come in!
- Hi, Mr. Sultenfuss.

02:48.051 --> 02:51.018
Look who I found! Hi, Judy.

02:51.020 --> 02:52.652
Hi.

02:52.654 --> 02:54.253
Come on in.

02:54.255 --> 02:55.921
That's okay.

02:55.923 --> 02:57.923
It's just a corpse.

02:57.925 --> 02:58.523
I know that.

02:58.525 --> 03:02.527
You should be here when they bring a body
that's been dead a couple of days...

03:02.529 --> 03:06.964
And they haven't found it yet
'cause it was in an apartment...

03:06.966 --> 03:09.333
And no one came to visit.

03:09.335 --> 03:10.967
Or floating in a river.

03:10.969 --> 03:14.937
Then the body starts turning
this weird shade of green,

03:14.939 --> 03:17.205
you know, like watery pea soup?

03:17.207 --> 03:19.006
The arms and legs
deteriorate first.

03:19.008 --> 03:22.776
The body looks like a raisin
with four fat legs.

03:22.778 --> 03:29.716
Anyway, this is why I'm seriously
considering cremation.

03:29.718 --> 03:31.684
Judy?

03:32.720 --> 03:34.352
Judy?

03:34.354 --> 03:38.723
I think you lost on the raisin
with the four fat legs, honey.

03:40.893 --> 03:43.860
Did you hear that, Dean?
You can stay!

03:43.862 --> 03:45.261
Dean?

03:45.263 --> 03:49.265
Yeah, Dean Martin.
Look at his eyes.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.866
They're pink.

03:50.868 --> 03:52.133
Exactly! Dean Martin.

03:52.135 --> 03:55.703
The cage is all set.

03:55.705 --> 03:57.004
Where's the bathroom.

03:57.006 --> 03:57.771
Are you kidding?

03:57.773 --> 04:01.074
Hamsters don't go
to the bathroom.

04:01.076 --> 04:04.777
Did you look in the bag?

04:05.412 --> 04:10.381
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles.
Said he went body surfing.

04:10.383 --> 04:13.684
I can't picture Uncle Phil
body surfing.

04:13.686 --> 04:14.985
I don't know if I want to.

04:14.987 --> 04:20.589
Vada, I want to ask you a favor.
You can absolutely say no

04:23.861 --> 04:25.727
I'm just bringing it up
for discussion.

04:25.729 --> 04:29.530
But, Harry, I thought
we weren't going to do this.

04:29.532 --> 04:31.832
Do what?

04:31.834 --> 04:34.668
Your room is
right next door to ours.

04:34.670 --> 04:36.403
We thought... I thought,
if you were willing,

04:36.405 --> 04:40.173
we might move you to gramoo's room
and use your room for the nursery.

04:40.175 --> 04:42.975
We'll be up half the night
with a newborn.

04:42.977 --> 04:44.943
A lot of noise...
you want me to move?

04:44.945 --> 04:46.444
Not far. Just down the hall.

04:46.446 --> 04:51.449
Plus, gramoo's room's bigger, and you
get a view of the whole neighborhood.

04:51.451 --> 04:54.952
Okay. No problem.

04:54.954 --> 04:58.188
Okay, thanks. Atta girl.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.565
Harry!

05:10.434 --> 05:14.035
Harry! I'm sorry to
interrupt, but vada's upset.

05:14.037 --> 05:17.905
Oh, she's fine.
She'll love her new room.

05:17.907 --> 05:20.974
We react to every kick
this baby gives.

05:20.976 --> 05:25.144
Maybe vada's trying
to tell us something too.

05:25.146 --> 05:28.614
The thing to remember is
you must visualize a spare.

05:28.616 --> 05:32.417
The parabola of the arcing
ball must intersect with

05:32.419 --> 05:33.618
the pyramid of the pins

05:33.620 --> 05:37.788
at precisely
this angle of attack.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.658
Shit.

05:42.594 --> 05:44.527
Visualize a spare?

05:44.529 --> 05:47.196
Well, you know what I mean.

05:47.198 --> 05:48.897
So, what's on your mind?

05:48.899 --> 05:52.333
Me? What makes you think
there's something on my mind?

05:52.335 --> 05:56.203
You're passing up Archie
bunker to go bowling.

05:56.205 --> 06:03.243
No. I just thought it'd be nice if the two
of us had an evening out so we could talk.

06:05.113 --> 06:08.948
- Shelly's already told me all about sex.
- She told me too.

06:08.950 --> 06:11.884
I mean, she told me
she told you about sex.

06:11.886 --> 06:15.487
I knew about sex
long before I met Shelly.

06:15.489 --> 06:18.189
I figured you did.

06:28.901 --> 06:29.966
Yes!

06:29.968 --> 06:32.568
Ah! Strike!

06:32.570 --> 06:35.070
Not bad at all.

06:35.072 --> 06:38.740
This talk isn't about sex.

06:38.742 --> 06:40.208
It's, well...

06:40.210 --> 06:42.977
I know you're upset
about losing your room.

06:42.979 --> 06:44.379
But the baby's
got to go somewhere!

06:44.380 --> 06:48.248
No, it's okay.
I understand, really.

06:48.250 --> 06:51.584
Honey, that's very mature.

06:51.586 --> 06:54.620
I'm proud of you, vada.

06:57.024 --> 06:59.991
Maybe I should
just move to China.

06:59.993 --> 07:02.493
One kid per family. That way
you don't lose your room.

07:02.495 --> 07:06.530
Why don't you just keep your room, and
we'll put the baby in the backyard?

07:06.532 --> 07:09.032
Don't do that!
You've got the whole garage.

07:09.034 --> 07:12.001
Right between the power mower
and the weed killer.

07:12.003 --> 07:16.739
Dad, I'm kidding.
You can have the room.

07:16.741 --> 07:18.107
Seriously?

07:18.109 --> 07:19.141
Seriously.

07:19.143 --> 07:22.377
- Great!
- I'm thirteen.

07:22.379 --> 07:26.414
Maybe it's about time
I got my own apartment.

07:27.316 --> 07:32.452
My mother can't have any more kids.
Neither can mine.

07:32.454 --> 07:37.156
She's dead. It's
Shelly who's pregnant.

07:37.158 --> 07:40.259
What do you think?

07:40.261 --> 07:42.294
I think I'm leaning
toward passion flower.

07:42.296 --> 07:47.932
"It combines traditional floral scent
with the musky aroma of sandalwood."

07:47.934 --> 07:49.900
What are you staring at?

07:49.902 --> 07:52.636
It's Kevin.

07:52.638 --> 07:53.903
I don't want him to see me.

07:53.905 --> 07:56.305
See you?
He can smell you from there.

07:56.307 --> 07:58.674
Oh, God! He's coming over here.

07:58.676 --> 08:02.044
Act natural... Totally natural.

08:05.115 --> 08:08.349
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hi.

08:09.018 --> 08:13.453
You look cool, sultenfuss.
You look like a grasshopper.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.793
- What's the matter?
- He likes you.

08:20.795 --> 08:24.096
Likes me? He said I look
like a grasshopper.

08:24.098 --> 08:28.767
Boys always pretend they hate you when
they really like you. -That's ridiculous!

08:28.769 --> 08:30.368
So, if you really
can't stand someone,

08:30.370 --> 08:33.169
you pretend you're
really crazy about them?

08:33.172 --> 08:35.804
I don't know, and I don't care!

08:35.807 --> 08:40.241
Kevin's a jerk, and I don't like him anymore.
He's all yours!

08:40.244 --> 08:43.979
If grasshopper's
a term of endearment,

08:43.981 --> 08:46.414
I've got a lot to learn.

08:46.416 --> 08:50.584
Have you guys thought of
any new names for the baby?

08:51.153 --> 08:55.021
Uh, if it's a girl, I'm kind
of leaning towards esme.

08:55.023 --> 09:00.026
Esme? -That kind of sounds
like a noise your nose makes.

09:00.028 --> 09:01.761
You know, "es-me."
I mean, it's...

09:01.763 --> 09:04.764
what if it's a boy? -Harry Jr.
Of course.

09:04.766 --> 09:08.000
When a boy likes you, does he
pretend he doesn't like you?

09:08.002 --> 09:12.304
And if he pretends he doesn't,
how can you tell he likes you?

09:12.306 --> 09:13.705
What boy likes you?

09:13.707 --> 09:15.707
It's just a question.
It's not about anybody.

09:15.709 --> 09:20.011
- Uh-oh! Here comes puberty.
- Vada, what you're talking about

09:20.013 --> 09:21.078
is the fear of rejection

09:21.080 --> 09:24.081
men will do anything
to avoid looking foolish.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.883
Oh, that's ridiculous. Where
are my needle-nose pliers?

09:26.885 --> 09:29.485
If a boy wants to do
homework with you,

09:29.487 --> 09:32.354
it means he didn't have the
nerve to ask you out on a date.

09:32.356 --> 09:34.889
You'll pretend to be studying,
and the next thing you know...

09:34.891 --> 09:39.260
You're ordering pizza and talking
about your favorite movie stars.

09:39.262 --> 09:42.529
So, you're saying...

09:42.531 --> 09:44.964
what are you saying?

09:44.966 --> 09:47.466
Honey, uh,

09:48.168 --> 09:49.600
guys don't want
to appear overanxious.

09:49.602 --> 09:52.703
If you think there's a boy that might
like you, let him know you like him...

09:52.705 --> 09:58.508
So he won't feel he's taking such
a risk when he's asking you out.

09:59.544 --> 10:01.243
Okay?

10:03.547 --> 10:07.315
<i>¶ I wanna jump</i>
<i>but I'm afraid I'll fall</i>

10:07.317 --> 10:11.952
<i>¶ I wanna holler</i>
<i>but the joint's too small</i>

10:11.954 --> 10:15.488

10:33.039 --> 10:39.343
<i>¶ I've got the rockin' pneumonia

10:40.479 --> 10:42.779
- hi.
- Hi. Wanna help me...

10:42.781 --> 10:45.114
Pick out wallpaper
for my new room tomorrow?

10:45.116 --> 10:48.617
Uh, I don't know.
Okay if I drink this?

10:48.619 --> 10:51.786
It's okay with me. Hi, Kevin.

10:51.788 --> 10:55.556
Well, if it isn't vada,
the grasshopper girl.

10:55.558 --> 10:57.057
Stop it, Kevin!

10:57.059 --> 10:59.025
I was kidding.
It's a joke, okay?

10:59.027 --> 11:02.061
We were just doing
our homework.

11:02.063 --> 11:03.695
Next thing know,
you're ordering pizza

11:03.697 --> 11:06.064
and talking about
your favorite movie stars.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.233
See ya!

11:23.282 --> 11:29.452
In the future, I'll stick to asking
dad for advice on embalming.

11:37.396 --> 11:40.930
<i>¶</i>

11:40.932 --> 11:44.800
<i>¶ Baby, baby</i>

11:44.802 --> 11:47.769
<i>¶ baby love my baby love</i>

11:47.771 --> 11:52.140
<i>¶ I need you oh, how I need you</i>

11:52.142 --> 11:56.344
<i>¶ why do you do me like you do</i>

11:56.346 --> 11:59.246
<i>¶ haven't I been good to you</i>

11:59.248 --> 12:03.783
<i>¶ so deep in love with you</i>

12:03.785 --> 12:06.952
<i>¶ baby, baby ¶</i>

12:06.954 --> 12:09.621
I read an article that says
if you sing to the baby...

12:09.623 --> 12:14.626
It's a calming influence. Assuming
the baby's a supremes fan.

12:14.628 --> 12:16.461
Bet your mom sang to you.

12:16.463 --> 12:20.231
I'm sure she did. She was
always reading. -I know.

12:20.233 --> 12:22.066
It runs in the family.
New book?

12:22.068 --> 12:23.934
"The collected works
of Alfred beidermeyer."

12:23.936 --> 12:27.804
- Her favorite poet.
- Never heard of him.

12:27.806 --> 12:31.340
Excuse me.

12:31.342 --> 12:33.508
How 'bout a nice glass of milk?

12:33.510 --> 12:36.344
With taco chips so I can dunk.

12:39.415 --> 12:41.448
You know, vada,
being an older sister,

12:41.450 --> 12:46.252
you're going to be very
important in this baby's life.

12:50.391 --> 12:53.291
They're enormous, I know.

12:54.727 --> 12:56.126
Is there milk in them already?

12:56.128 --> 12:59.095
No. The milk comes
when the baby comes.

12:59.097 --> 13:01.664
When did you, um...

13:01.666 --> 13:04.667
- I mean, um...
- Oh.

13:04.669 --> 13:08.604
I was a late developer. They used
to call me "Shelly two-backs."

13:08.606 --> 13:12.608
All my friends had real bras,
not the training ones I had.

13:12.610 --> 13:14.443
Why do they call them
training bras?

13:14.445 --> 13:16.711
- It's not like learning to ride a bike.
- I know.

13:16.713 --> 13:21.549
It's just sort of preparing you
for the rest of your life.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.517
It's not easy being a woman.

13:23.519 --> 13:24.951
You're telling me.

13:24.953 --> 13:29.588
All the great writers pondered
the meaning of life and death.

13:29.590 --> 13:32.624
I've been thinking a lot
about my mother recently,

13:32.626 --> 13:34.292
even though I don't have
any memories of her.

13:34.294 --> 13:39.230
I wish I could see her just once,
even if it were only in a dream.

13:39.232 --> 13:41.932
I know she'd help me
figure things out.

13:41.934 --> 13:46.836
"Bless me now with
your fierce tears, I pray.

13:46.838 --> 13:51.040
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

13:51.042 --> 13:56.478
Rage! Rage against
the dying of the light."

13:56.480 --> 13:59.614
What do you think
Dylan Thomas is saying?

13:59.616 --> 14:02.750
"Rage against the dying
of the light."

14:02.752 --> 14:06.620
He's mad 'cause they shut off
his electricity?

14:06.622 --> 14:08.722
I think he was referring
to life energy,

14:08.724 --> 14:11.958
which in your case wouldn't
cause much of a power shortage.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.261
- Would it?
- Ooh!

14:17.198 --> 14:18.330
Vada.

14:18.332 --> 14:20.765
The poem's
really about attitude.

14:20.767 --> 14:23.300
It's about not giving up.

14:23.302 --> 14:26.069
It's easy to be
overwhelmed sometimes,

14:26.071 --> 14:31.974
but that's when we should
force ourselves to push on.

14:31.976 --> 14:33.442
Alfred beidermeyer said:

14:33.444 --> 14:35.977
"To heed the urgent
inner voice,

14:35.979 --> 14:39.680
embracing destiny, not choice."

14:39.682 --> 14:42.616
That's very good, vada.

14:42.618 --> 14:45.218
All right, moving on!

14:45.220 --> 14:49.922
I want to give you guys
a chance to write.

14:49.924 --> 14:52.124
Hey, hey, hey! Listen up!

14:52.126 --> 14:55.360
I want you to write about
someone very special,

14:55.362 --> 14:59.063
someone interesting,
someone you admire,

14:59.065 --> 15:02.666
someone who's achieved
something worth writing about.

15:02.668 --> 15:05.502
It's got to be a stranger,
someone you've never met.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.304
I want you to investigate
the personal side.

15:08.306 --> 15:11.807
Play Perry Mason,
see what you can come up with.

15:11.809 --> 15:16.678
All right? Any ideas?

15:16.680 --> 15:17.412
Remember two things:

15:17.414 --> 15:22.750
Someone who's achieved something,
and someone you've never met.

15:23.119 --> 15:25.819
Kevin. Elvis, the king.

15:25.821 --> 15:28.655
Elvis, the king!

15:28.723 --> 15:31.423
Devin! Farah fawcett.

15:31.425 --> 15:33.725
I love to watch that girl run.

15:33.727 --> 15:35.760
Why is that?

15:37.263 --> 15:39.062
N-never mind.

15:39.764 --> 15:43.532
Vada, who have you
come up with?

15:44.568 --> 15:47.602
My mother.

15:48.404 --> 15:50.237
Your mother?

15:51.306 --> 15:54.073
I never met my mother.

15:57.645 --> 15:59.411
I know my mom's
favorite color was pink,

15:59.413 --> 16:02.714
and she ate peanut butter and
banana sandwiches for breakfast;

16:02.716 --> 16:05.616
But that's not what I would
call hard-hitting facts.

16:05.618 --> 16:07.651
I told you about the
pumpkin, didn't I? -No.

16:07.653 --> 16:10.086
I bought her this
huge pumpkin for Halloween.

16:10.088 --> 16:13.489
She couldn't bear to carve it. It
ended up under the Christmas tree.

16:13.491 --> 16:18.961
Gramoo said on Christmas Eve there was
this sickening smell permeating the house.

16:18.963 --> 16:23.165
When I picked it up, it exploded
and liquefied at the same time.

16:23.167 --> 16:27.169
It wasn't funny. It soaked
through gramoo's oriental.

16:27.171 --> 16:31.306
There's still a big spot
on the floor.

16:33.109 --> 16:36.110
- Okay, we need wallpaper paste.
- There.

16:36.112 --> 16:39.113
Isn't there anything else
you remember?

16:39.115 --> 16:41.882
How did you propose?
Was it romantic?

16:41.884 --> 16:45.051
I kind of just blurted it out
over a root beer float.

16:45.053 --> 16:48.054
Mmm, root beer float!
That sounds good.

16:48.056 --> 16:51.157
Did she mention any contests
that she won?

16:51.159 --> 16:54.560
She must have had some awards,
she was so talented.

16:54.562 --> 16:59.031
She was talented. I wish
I could help you more.

16:59.033 --> 17:01.933
Your mother and I had
a whirlwind courtship.

17:01.935 --> 17:04.935
She came to town with
a traveling theater group.

17:04.938 --> 17:07.137
I proposed on our second date.
Two weeks later we married.

17:07.140 --> 17:11.275
Nine months later, you were
here and she was gone.

17:11.277 --> 17:12.909
Was it a nice funeral?

17:12.911 --> 17:14.609
Oh, yes, lovely funeral.

17:14.612 --> 17:16.411
Grenaldi brothers
did a beautiful job.

17:16.413 --> 17:19.714
Lots of pink roses,
and I used the white hearse.

17:19.715 --> 17:24.919
Hey, how 'bout this flowered
wallpaper for your room?

17:24.921 --> 17:28.989
How 'bout this?

17:31.360 --> 17:34.127
- Hi, Mr. Owett.
- Hey, vada.

17:34.996 --> 17:38.597
- How's your report coming?
- Great!

17:38.599 --> 17:41.399
I have so much to say,
I hardly know where to start.

17:41.401 --> 17:43.934
I've been rereading
Virginia woolf.

17:43.936 --> 17:46.736
She'd be a natural for you.

17:46.738 --> 17:48.070
She led a fascinating life.

17:48.072 --> 17:51.173
Thanks, but I think
I'm gonna stick to my mom.

17:51.175 --> 17:53.441
She led a fascinating life too.

17:53.443 --> 17:56.310
I'm sure she did.

17:56.312 --> 17:59.546
- Hey, guys!
- Hi.

17:59.548 --> 18:00.246
Vada,

18:00.248 --> 18:02.982
he was giving you an easy out so you
didn't have to write about your mother.

18:02.984 --> 18:07.353
I want to write about her. -You're crazy!
What was her achievement?

18:07.355 --> 18:13.158
Did she invent gravity? -No one
invented gravity. It just exists.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.125
Then what did she do?

18:14.127 --> 18:19.230
I'm not supposed to talk about it,
but I might as well tell you.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.865
She was a spy
against the Russians.

18:21.867 --> 18:24.067
Oh, please! Who do you
think you're kidding?

18:24.069 --> 18:28.271
Where did she spy on the Russians from?
Here in Pennsylvania?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.239
Not here in Pennsylvania!

18:30.241 --> 18:32.975
She went to Russia undercover
with her acting troupe,

18:32.977 --> 18:37.579
and got a lot of highly-sensitive
plans sent back.

18:37.581 --> 18:39.714
When she was about to go home,

18:39.716 --> 18:42.349
she got caught and they killed her.
All right.

18:42.351 --> 18:46.553
When did she have you between
all of her acting and spying?

18:46.555 --> 18:50.189
That's simple:
She was pregnant with me...

18:50.191 --> 18:52.224
When she went to Russia,
and she didn't know.

18:52.226 --> 18:54.159
When the Russians found out,
they waited to shoot her...

18:54.161 --> 18:58.096
'Cause you're not allowed to kill
pregnant women anywhere in the world.

18:58.098 --> 19:00.932
She had you in jail in Russia?

19:00.934 --> 19:03.301
Actually, I was born
in Siberia.

19:03.303 --> 19:07.672
Then they shot her, and sent
me home with my dad. Vada,

19:07.674 --> 19:11.676
if bullshit wore a bra,
you'd be top-heavy.

19:11.678 --> 19:13.678
C'mon, Judy.

19:13.680 --> 19:17.782
Ask anyone. Ask my dad.

19:18.451 --> 19:20.684
It could be true.

19:29.061 --> 19:32.462
How come guys talk so much
when thay have nothing to say,

19:32.464 --> 19:36.599
and girls have plenty to say,
but no one will listen?

19:42.006 --> 19:47.776
I used to come down here and sleep
on this spot when I was little.

19:49.312 --> 19:52.880
My report's gonna be
a disaster.

19:52.882 --> 19:56.917
Everything I know about her
fits into one, little box.

19:56.919 --> 19:59.252
A box?

20:01.789 --> 20:07.225
Oh, vada!
What a sweet baby book!

20:07.760 --> 20:10.627
It's only filled out
to page two.

20:12.263 --> 20:14.830
I was eight pounds, four ounces

20:14.832 --> 20:18.533
there's so many programs.

20:18.535 --> 20:19.300
She was in a lot of plays.

20:19.302 --> 20:26.173
Dad said when she was on stage, she held
the audience in the palm of her hand.

20:27.009 --> 20:30.677
What's this?
"December 8th, 1958."

20:30.679 --> 20:34.080
I don't know.
Dad doesn't either.

20:34.082 --> 20:35.881
It must mean something.

20:35.883 --> 20:38.516
She was obviously
very sentimental.

20:38.518 --> 20:41.085
This is one of
my favorite things:

20:41.087 --> 20:43.320
Her passport.

20:43.322 --> 20:47.624
Oh, vada, she's so beautiful.

20:49.628 --> 20:50.593
"Margaret Ann muldovan,

20:50.595 --> 20:54.630
born in Los Angeles, California,
February 7th, 1936."

20:54.632 --> 20:57.032
Aquarius. Margaret's
my middle name.

20:57.034 --> 21:01.036
Everybody called her Maggie.
Los Angeles.

21:01.038 --> 21:02.804
- Have you ever been there?
- No.

21:02.806 --> 21:06.440
You know, they say
that it never rains;

21:06.442 --> 21:10.110
That you can barbecue
on Christmas day.

21:10.112 --> 21:13.379
You just surf
to your friend's house.

21:13.381 --> 21:15.814
And the place is just
crawling with celebrities.

21:15.816 --> 21:20.385
I know someone who saw Walter matthau
picking up his dry cleaning.

21:20.387 --> 21:22.186
Is that why
Uncle Phil moved there?

21:22.188 --> 21:25.422
Uncle Phil
just needed a change,

21:25.424 --> 21:27.957
a little adventure.

21:27.959 --> 21:31.427
Wonder why she got a passport
if she never went anywhere?

21:31.429 --> 21:33.328
You've got to be prepared.

21:33.330 --> 21:36.864
I'm definitely traveling
someday.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.566
Why not now?

21:39.568 --> 21:40.533
What do you mean?

21:40.535 --> 21:45.004
How would you like to visit your
Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...

21:45.006 --> 21:47.673
Next week during
your spring vacation?

21:47.675 --> 21:49.274
You could do research
on your mom!

21:49.276 --> 21:52.410
But what about you and the baby?
You need me.

21:52.412 --> 21:56.881
I'm not due for
another six weeks!

21:56.883 --> 22:00.050
It would be kind of great.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.185
It would be fantastic!

22:02.187 --> 22:04.487
But dad will never go for it.

22:04.489 --> 22:08.123
You leave your father to me.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.125
You should encourage her
to spread her wings!

22:10.127 --> 22:12.494
She can spread her wings
right here in Pennsylvania.

22:12.496 --> 22:14.329
You don't send a child
alone to Los Angeles.

22:14.331 --> 22:18.066
- She could come back with her ears pierced!
- She is not a child!

22:18.068 --> 22:20.968
- She's a young woman on the brink of...
- Disaster!

22:20.970 --> 22:25.472
- Disaster lurks behind every... palm tree.
- You're being narrow-minded.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.606
Maybe when she's older,
I'd be happy...

22:26.608 --> 22:32.345
- hi, vada. We were having a little...
- A fight about me.

22:32.347 --> 22:35.414
Wouldn't you like to hear
my opinion?

22:35.416 --> 22:36.248
Of course.

22:36.250 --> 22:41.786
If I'm old enough to accept
a new baby and a new room,

22:41.788 --> 22:42.953
I'm old enough
to go to California.

22:42.955 --> 22:46.056
I know it's fun to think
about these things, but...

22:46.058 --> 22:47.924
I already bought a ticket.

22:47.926 --> 22:48.457
What?

22:48.459 --> 22:50.392
I used my own money
and got a great deal.

22:50.394 --> 22:55.563
It's a q47nr, five-day fare, which
means I change planes in Dallas,

22:55.565 --> 22:59.199
and stay over a Saturday;
No exchanges or refunds.

22:59.201 --> 23:03.903
So if you don't let me go, I will
have wasted my entire life's savings.

23:03.905 --> 23:07.139
Uh, I, I... but, but...

23:07.741 --> 23:13.177
isn't it against the law to
sell airline tickets to minors?

23:15.347 --> 23:18.948
Don't tell me you aided
and abetted this scheme?

23:18.950 --> 23:20.015
Vada needed me.

23:20.017 --> 23:23.651
Besides, the airline requires the
signature of an adult, and...

23:23.653 --> 23:25.819
they forgot to ask for one who
wasn't having hormone surges.

23:25.821 --> 23:29.656
Come on, Harry! We're talking
about five days here!

23:29.658 --> 23:33.092
I think we're going overboard
for a simple school assignment.

23:33.094 --> 23:35.727
It's not
a little school assignment.

23:35.729 --> 23:39.430
Maybe all of this is happening
for a reason. -What reason?

23:39.432 --> 23:43.567
Phil's moving to L.A.,
gramoo's passing,

23:43.569 --> 23:46.570
the baby being born,
vada's report.

23:46.572 --> 23:48.705
Maybe all of these are signs...

23:48.707 --> 23:52.508
Signs that it's time
for vada to take this trip.

23:52.510 --> 23:54.610
Signs. Whoo-oo!

23:54.612 --> 23:58.580
Let me get the loch ness monster on the phone.
You have a lot to talk about.

23:58.582 --> 24:02.450
No, I'm sorry. Vada is
not going to Los Angeles.

24:02.452 --> 24:05.686
I have made my decision,
and that is final.

24:05.688 --> 24:06.920
Remember, don't talk to anyone.

24:06.922 --> 24:09.656
Even if a nun sits next to
you, don't talk to her.

24:09.658 --> 24:13.393
No nuns. Got it. And
no boys, promise me.

24:13.395 --> 24:15.762
Those L.A. people
are all so corrupt.

24:15.764 --> 24:17.196
You'll end up pregnant
and on drugs!

24:17.198 --> 24:19.164
Don't come running to me when
you wake up in city morgue...

24:19.166 --> 24:23.434
Having been beaten to an
unrecognizable pulp by some surfer.

24:23.436 --> 24:25.102
And don't make eye contact!

24:25.104 --> 24:28.638
It communicates an implied vulnerability.
What does that mean?

24:28.640 --> 24:33.442
I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let
his baby girl out of his sight...

24:33.444 --> 24:35.577
For the simple reason
he's a paranoid nitwit.

24:35.579 --> 24:40.315
So just say, "oh, dad!"
And get on the damn plane.

24:40.317 --> 24:43.584
Bye, dad. I'll miss you.

24:44.954 --> 24:48.322
Thanks. I needed that.

24:48.324 --> 24:52.726
I'll be back in 137 hours.

24:52.728 --> 24:54.994
Have fun.

24:54.996 --> 24:58.797
<i>¶ Blue-Jean baby</i>

24:58.799 --> 25:01.232
<i>¶ L.A. lady ¶</i>

25:01.234 --> 25:02.900
not too much.

25:02.902 --> 25:06.770
<i>¶ Seamstress for the band</i>

25:08.874 --> 25:11.140
<i>¶ pretty eyes</i>

25:12.143 --> 25:14.710
<i>¶ pirate's smile</i>

25:15.879 --> 25:19.080
<i>¶ you marry a music man ¶</i>

25:19.082 --> 25:24.051
It's hard to believe my mother's
whole life fits into this box.

25:24.053 --> 25:27.954
I've got to think of
this stuff as clues...

25:27.956 --> 25:29.121
Or good luck charms.

25:29.123 --> 25:35.560
But I need more than luck to solve this puzzle.
I need a miracle.

25:35.562 --> 25:38.496
<i>¶ Now she's in me</i>

25:38.498 --> 25:41.599
<i>¶ always with me</i>

25:41.601 --> 25:47.037
<i>¶ tiny dancer in my hand ¶</i>

25:58.715 --> 26:01.482
Arriving passengers,
flight 627,

26:01.484 --> 26:05.652
your baggage is now
available on the carousel.

26:15.730 --> 26:19.364
Arriving passenger, Mrs. Crane,
please see the ticket agent...

26:19.366 --> 26:22.800
At the airline
reservation's counter.

26:22.802 --> 26:26.637
Arriving passenger, Mrs. Crane,
please see the ticket agent...

26:26.639 --> 26:30.007
At the airline
reservation's counter.

26:47.159 --> 26:50.226
Are you waiting for someone?

26:51.295 --> 26:52.727
Excuse me.
I asked you a question.

26:52.729 --> 26:55.830
I'm not supposed to talk
to strangers, not even nuns.

26:55.832 --> 26:58.132
You're vada, right?

26:58.134 --> 27:00.868
- How did you know my name?
- Your Uncle Phil told me.

27:00.870 --> 27:04.137
Where is he? He was
supposed to meet me! -Relax!

27:04.139 --> 27:05.972
Do you think I kidnapped him?

27:05.974 --> 27:08.808
This is California.
Anything's possible.

27:08.810 --> 27:13.078
If I was looking for a victim, I
wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil...

27:13.080 --> 27:16.481
Who outweighs me by 150 pounds.

27:16.483 --> 27:19.116
Besides, who would I ask
for ransom? You?

27:19.118 --> 27:21.118
Are you suffering from
a chemical imbalance,

27:21.120 --> 27:24.521
- or is it just an attitude problem?
- My only problem...

27:24.523 --> 27:26.155
Is that Phil gave me
five bucks to pick you up,

27:26.157 --> 27:31.927
but I don't get paid until delivery.
That is a problem.

27:34.364 --> 27:37.565
Put that down!
I'll call the police!

27:37.567 --> 27:38.232
What are you gonna do?

27:38.234 --> 27:41.301
Tell them a polite person
helped carry your bag?

27:41.303 --> 27:45.038
I don't think you're polite. -I
don't think you've very grateful.

27:45.040 --> 27:49.375
A lot of people in your
position would say thank you.

27:50.411 --> 27:52.611
Thank you. Don't mention it.

27:52.613 --> 27:56.514
- I don't even know your name.
- It's Nick.

27:56.516 --> 27:58.449
There you go.

27:59.385 --> 28:02.185
- Okay.
- Thanks.

28:02.587 --> 28:04.853
Oh, great! No cabs!

28:04.855 --> 28:07.222
- I have a gift for you.
- Thanks.

28:07.224 --> 28:08.356
No, thanks!

28:08.358 --> 28:11.625
- He said it was a gift.
- Yeah, right!

28:11.627 --> 28:15.161
- I don't need you...
- Taxi!

28:15.163 --> 28:18.230
Get in! Get in!

28:19.032 --> 28:23.134
You look like a man who knows where he's goin'.
Where're we headed?

28:23.136 --> 28:26.604
Take the 405 to Santa Monica,
Santa Monica to whittier,

28:26.606 --> 28:28.706
and whittier to sunset.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.945
<i>¶ Ooh-ooh</i>

28:34.947 --> 28:39.683

29:42.373 --> 29:44.272
Here you go.

29:44.274 --> 29:47.775
See that building?
My grandfather built it.

29:47.777 --> 29:50.878
"Budapest auto repair."

29:50.880 --> 29:52.646
That's my room right up there.

29:52.648 --> 29:57.484
One of these days,
this is all gonna be mine.

30:01.223 --> 30:03.289
Uncle Phil?

30:03.291 --> 30:05.324
Vada!

30:06.593 --> 30:09.060
Look at you! Oh, hi!

30:09.062 --> 30:12.930
Hi! How are you?
You look great.

30:12.932 --> 30:15.265
- How's Shelly, your dad?
- They're great.

30:15.267 --> 30:17.200
Did Nick take good care of you?

30:17.202 --> 30:20.970
He was very polite.
Worth the entire $5.

30:20.972 --> 30:24.807
Aha. Well, good to know.

30:26.043 --> 30:26.908
Thanks.

30:26.910 --> 30:28.743
Give it back, Nicholas!

30:28.745 --> 30:30.878
But we made a business deal!

30:30.880 --> 30:35.249
What happened to a good,
old-fashioned favor, huh?

30:35.251 --> 30:38.852
Irving, our family's been dealing
with your company over 40 yrears,

30:38.854 --> 30:41.221
either the timing chain is here or it isn't.
I don't see it.

30:41.223 --> 30:45.258
You want to explain to the customers
why we can't reassemble the cars

30:45.260 --> 30:46.525
cause not all
the parts are here?

30:46.527 --> 30:53.331
I don't need this flubber from you. Are we
clear or do I have to speak with your father?

30:54.133 --> 30:55.765
Thank you.

30:56.934 --> 30:59.901
Yes, yes.
I love you, too, Irving.

31:01.571 --> 31:04.271
You must be vada!

31:04.273 --> 31:07.474
Oh, what a face! Oh!

31:07.476 --> 31:11.678
If I had a face like that, I
wouldn't have to yell so much.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.312
I'm rose zsigmond,

31:13.314 --> 31:16.515
- Nick's mother, among other things.
- You're Nick's mother?

31:16.517 --> 31:19.351
Did you think he was
raised by wolves?

31:19.353 --> 31:21.753
- Don't be misled by the haircut.
- Oh, mom!

31:21.755 --> 31:25.590
Who knew when I started working in the
finest foreign car shop in L.A...

31:25.592 --> 31:29.794
- I would also find the light of my life?
- He left out a couple steps.

31:29.796 --> 31:33.998
I've got to get back to these bills.
Help vada get settled.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.534
C'mon, I'll show you
where you're gonna stay.

31:39.304 --> 31:41.203
Here we go!

31:41.205 --> 31:45.173
Not what you expected
from downstairs, right?

31:45.175 --> 31:49.510
We'll put your stuff
in this closet.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.580
You can unpack later.

31:53.582 --> 31:56.015
And this is where you sleep.

31:56.017 --> 31:58.617
Luckily, this sofa bed
is really comfortable.

31:58.619 --> 32:02.687
I can tell you that
from personal experience.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.122
Bathroom.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.723
You have to...

32:06.725 --> 32:09.158
rose and my room.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.993
She lives here too?

32:10.995 --> 32:16.264
Uh, that's right.
One big happy family.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.033
This is Nick's room.

32:19.035 --> 32:21.635
Are you engaged or something?

32:21.637 --> 32:23.169
Seriously dating.

32:23.171 --> 32:26.238
You're thirsty.
Want something to drink?

32:26.240 --> 32:30.742
Sure you do! Been a long trip.

32:31.945 --> 32:34.679
You see, vada, marriage...

32:34.681 --> 32:37.114
marriage is a very big step,

32:37.116 --> 32:38.949
and...

32:38.951 --> 32:43.053
Not something to be
entered into lightly.

32:43.055 --> 32:44.320
See, I just...

32:44.322 --> 32:46.989
I just want to make
very sure...

32:46.991 --> 32:49.725
That everything is
absolutely right...

32:49.727 --> 32:51.526
Before I go jumping into
some kind...

32:51.528 --> 32:53.828
sounds like you have a fear
of commitment, Uncle Phil.

32:53.830 --> 32:57.765
That's ridiculous. I'm very...
what do you call it?

32:57.767 --> 33:00.567
- Committed?
- Committed.

33:00.569 --> 33:04.771
Does that mean
you sleep here every night?

33:05.173 --> 33:07.273
Yes, it does.

33:08.142 --> 33:10.775
That's not exactly dating,
is it?

33:10.777 --> 33:14.578
Vada, I know that
traditionally...

33:14.580 --> 33:16.680
You're not supposed to do
a lot of these things...

33:16.682 --> 33:19.683
Before you're
officially married.

33:19.685 --> 33:21.685
But these are

33:21.687 --> 33:25.455
very, very
special circumstances.

33:25.457 --> 33:30.560
When sex is involved, it's
always special circumstances.

33:30.562 --> 33:36.465
My parents had a brief, but
intensely fulfilling relationship.

33:36.467 --> 33:39.000
She's remained a woman
of mystery to this day.

33:39.002 --> 33:41.235
And you're gonna
solve the mystery?

33:41.237 --> 33:44.504
I've got it figured out. I know
she went to Wilson high school.

33:44.506 --> 33:48.074
I'm gonna go there and
get a copy of her yearbook.

33:48.076 --> 33:51.477
I can get the names of people
she was in clubs with,

33:51.479 --> 33:54.246
and find out who her friends were.
You'll be all set.

33:54.248 --> 33:58.950
- You're very organized.
- I have to be. I only have five days.

33:58.952 --> 34:00.117
So, just point me
in the right direction.

34:00.119 --> 34:05.889
I'll do better than that. I'll send
you off with your own, private guide.

34:06.524 --> 34:07.322
Me?

34:07.324 --> 34:10.891
I'd consider it
a personal favor.

34:14.664 --> 34:20.034
It's not like you had a whole lot
planned for this week right?

34:20.036 --> 34:20.900
It'll be okay.

34:20.902 --> 34:24.070
Hey, here you go.

34:24.072 --> 34:26.005
What's that?

34:26.007 --> 34:27.272
Ten bucks.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.906
What's it for?

34:28.908 --> 34:30.706
For the mini-bike fund.

34:30.708 --> 34:31.174
Wow!

34:31.176 --> 34:35.143
Well I know you're not crazy about
taking vada around tomorrow, so...

34:35.146 --> 34:37.646
I just want you to
know I appreciate it though.

34:37.648 --> 34:38.446
No problem.

34:38.447 --> 34:39.413
You're a good man, Nicholas.

34:39.415 --> 34:43.583
Phil, I think you
should consider...

35:24.759 --> 35:27.793
<i>¶ Doctor my eyes</i>
<i>have seen the years</i>

35:27.795 --> 35:29.427
<i>¶ through a slow parade ¶</i>

35:29.429 --> 35:31.896
I thought my mom went
to school in LA,

35:31.898 --> 35:34.498
we've gotta be closing
in on the grand canyon.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.734
But I'm sure for a trip
to the grand canyon

35:37.736 --> 35:42.505
you'd charge a little more
than ten dollars.

35:42.507 --> 35:46.976
You know eavesdropping is
a very unattractive habit.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.011
I wasn't eavesdropping,
I was overhearing.

35:49.013 --> 35:53.582
I didn't ask for the money,
Phil just gave it to me.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.750
Well look, I know that
all you care about

35:55.752 --> 35:58.252
is your precious mini-bike.

35:58.254 --> 36:01.955
It's obvious you have no sense
of historical perspective,

36:01.957 --> 36:03.289
I think we're here.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.858
Getting off, please.

36:06.493 --> 36:10.194
Excuse me, pardon,
thank you, excuse me.

36:31.817 --> 36:34.684
Where's the school?

36:37.288 --> 36:41.857
"Due to a devastating fire
June 17, 1963...

36:41.859 --> 36:45.694
Wilson high school was closed."

36:45.696 --> 36:47.295
I can't believe it!

36:47.297 --> 36:48.629
My mother's high school
burned down.

36:48.631 --> 36:53.133
They have no sense of
historical perspective either.

36:53.135 --> 36:56.102
It's not funny!
What am I gonna do?

36:56.104 --> 36:58.070
Without that yearbook,
I'm lost.

36:58.072 --> 37:03.408
I can't just walk around looking for
someone with a Wilson high letter sweater!

37:03.410 --> 37:05.410
- Vada? Calm down.
- What?

37:05.412 --> 37:08.813
We have to ask ourselves
where yearbooks come from.

37:08.815 --> 37:12.616
They don't appear
out of thin air.

37:14.653 --> 37:17.920
Watch these machines now.

37:18.022 --> 37:19.755
This is really
very nice of you.

37:19.757 --> 37:23.959
It's no problem.
I had a mother once myself.

37:28.799 --> 37:30.899
If it's in here at all,

37:30.901 --> 37:32.901
it's in the back two rows.

37:32.903 --> 37:36.638
Thank you very much.
Happy hunting.

37:39.009 --> 37:44.612
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm
getting a nosebleed from the altitude.

37:44.614 --> 37:47.715
Just remember
the needle in the haystack.

37:47.717 --> 37:50.417
I never did understand
that story.

37:50.419 --> 37:53.453
Did someone find a needle
or not?

37:53.455 --> 37:54.954
What difference does it make?

37:54.956 --> 37:55.955
A big difference.

37:55.957 --> 37:57.790
If someone found it,
we should keep looking.

37:57.792 --> 38:01.059
If they didn't,
we're just wasting our time.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.494
Oh, my gosh! Here it is!

38:08.000 --> 38:10.600
Look, here she is.
"Margaret Ann muldovan.

38:10.602 --> 38:13.369
"Newspaper, literary magazine,
French club, drama club,

38:13.371 --> 38:16.438
"glee club, girls' basketball
and swim team.

38:16.440 --> 38:19.007
"With Maggie's combo of
good looks and talent,

38:19.009 --> 38:21.309
we're sure to be seeing
her name in lights."

38:21.311 --> 38:22.910
She was going to be famous.

38:22.912 --> 38:24.912
Those books always set you up
for disappointment.

38:24.914 --> 38:26.780
I want mine to say:

38:26.782 --> 38:27.981
Nick probably won't
amount to much.

38:27.983 --> 38:32.051
So don't be surprised if you never
hear anything about him again.

38:32.053 --> 38:33.752
Can we go?

38:33.754 --> 38:37.088
It's smells like someone
left their gym bag in here.

38:37.090 --> 38:38.856
It's the leather bindings.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.291
I love the fragrance
of vintage books.

38:41.293 --> 38:44.861
I love the fragrance
of chili dogs.

38:44.863 --> 38:47.296
He was on the school paper
with my mom.

38:47.298 --> 38:52.501
Great! A full page of tanakas,
15 with the initial "d."

38:52.503 --> 38:54.870
This is gonna be tough.
Don't forget,

38:54.872 --> 38:57.806
the girls changed their names
if they got married.

38:57.808 --> 39:01.543
- I'd never do that.
- Get married?

39:01.545 --> 39:02.544
Change my name.

39:02.546 --> 39:04.746
You think the guy
should change his name?

39:04.748 --> 39:06.681
I don't think anybody
should change their names.

39:06.683 --> 39:10.117
That way you can find them
when you need them.

39:10.119 --> 39:12.319
What if you
don't want to be found?

39:12.321 --> 39:16.022
Why do you argue
with everything I say?

39:33.241 --> 39:35.040
Hi. Can I help ya?

39:35.042 --> 39:39.044
Does someone named
Daryl Tanaka work here?

39:39.746 --> 39:43.180
Hey, Tanaka! You got company!

39:43.348 --> 39:47.750
It's too bad about your mom, but
at least she went peacefully.

39:47.752 --> 39:50.285
I've seen a lot go out
the hard way.

39:50.287 --> 39:52.253
What do you remember about her?

39:52.255 --> 39:55.122
We worked on
the school paper together.

39:55.124 --> 39:57.190
I remember when
the legion of decency

39:57.192 --> 39:59.392
declared rebel without a cause
unfit.

39:59.394 --> 40:05.231
Jim backus, what an actor, huh?
What an actor.

40:05.866 --> 40:09.300
She wrote this article about
censorship and the first amendment.

40:09.302 --> 40:10.534
She was really something!

40:10.536 --> 40:12.836
Graduation? Some big
congressman saying...

40:12.838 --> 40:15.605
Senator McCarthy was
the greatest American ever.

40:15.607 --> 40:19.775
Maggie gets up in front
of 500 people, walks out.

40:19.777 --> 40:21.042
Couple people followed her too.

40:21.044 --> 40:24.812
Took a lot of guts. -You
walked out with my mother?

40:24.814 --> 40:28.882
Are you kidding?
My parents would've shot me.

40:28.884 --> 40:32.518
I was the president of
the young Republicans.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.952
Nisei, second generation.

40:33.954 --> 40:36.988
Hall monitor. I didn't want
to start world war III.

40:36.990 --> 40:41.726
You saved a lot of lives.
You should be very proud.

40:41.728 --> 40:46.197
Um, I'm trying to find out
her greatest achievement.

40:47.366 --> 40:51.468
She was the first girl
ever suspended for smoking.

40:51.470 --> 40:53.903
Suspended from school?
My mother?

40:53.905 --> 40:57.840
Everyone was really surprised
when Maggie was turned in.

40:57.842 --> 40:59.875
She got kicked out
for two weeks.

40:59.877 --> 41:03.278
What kind of sleazoid geek
would turn her in?

41:03.280 --> 41:07.415
- I would do it again in a minute!
- You ratted on my mother?

41:07.417 --> 41:09.950
Who are you?
Hitler's hall monitor?

41:09.952 --> 41:11.685
Maybe you should join
a hippie commune.

41:11.687 --> 41:14.220
But let me tell you something,
sooner or later

41:14.222 --> 41:17.056
it's gonna be your turn
to take out the garbage.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.291
What about giving
the other guy a break?

41:19.293 --> 41:22.761
What about living
in the real world, pal?

41:23.263 --> 41:25.029
Tanaka, got a minute?

41:25.031 --> 41:27.264
I'll be right there.

41:32.804 --> 41:33.202
Oh, uh,

41:33.204 --> 41:38.173
I'd be a little more careful
of who I hung around with.

41:43.480 --> 41:46.247
Care for a smoke?

41:49.752 --> 41:52.018
This'll be great in my report.

41:52.020 --> 41:54.553
My mother was suspended
for smoking.

41:54.555 --> 41:56.321
I think it's cool.

41:56.323 --> 41:57.655
You would.

41:57.657 --> 41:58.956
You'd rather have a mother

41:58.958 --> 42:01.525
that's a member
of the police state?

42:01.527 --> 42:05.595
Rules are made to be broken.

42:05.597 --> 42:08.064
Just ask him.

42:08.066 --> 42:11.700
That the president
has nothing to hide

42:11.702 --> 42:14.202
in this matter.

42:27.383 --> 42:29.116
- Hello.
- Hi.

42:29.118 --> 42:32.119
What can I do for you? -I'm
staying at the chateau.

42:32.121 --> 42:36.957
The guy who runs the garage said
you're the best jag people in town.

42:36.959 --> 42:40.560
Well, Enrique is great,
and we are the best.

42:40.562 --> 42:44.997
- Then I have come to the right place.
- I guess you have.

42:44.999 --> 42:49.201
I'm Sam helburn. Sam.

42:49.203 --> 42:50.001
Rose.

42:50.003 --> 42:56.173
So, what's wrong? -Nothing...
Nothing at all.

42:56.175 --> 42:58.608
I mean... With your car.

42:58.610 --> 43:02.745
Oh! Uh... Oil change.

43:02.747 --> 43:06.715
I just drove in
from Chicago and...

43:06.717 --> 43:10.218
- nice hair.
- Excuse me?

43:10.220 --> 43:13.355
I was commenting on your hair.

43:13.357 --> 43:15.824
Oh, are you a hairdresser?

43:17.194 --> 43:21.229
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.

43:21.231 --> 43:23.164
Oh, you mean you...

43:23.166 --> 43:28.068
Fix the hearts
of little babies?

43:28.070 --> 43:29.969
Mostly little babies,

43:29.971 --> 43:33.572
but not exclusively.

43:34.575 --> 43:37.309
It's all in the hands.
You have nice hands.

43:37.311 --> 43:40.211
- Do you operate?
- Yes, I do.

43:40.213 --> 43:44.081
So, I guess I'll always teach.

43:44.083 --> 43:46.716
It's a good relief
from the operating room.

43:46.718 --> 43:49.952
- I feel I have an obligation...
- Hi. Phil sultenfuss.

43:49.954 --> 43:52.654
Oh, sorry.
Some kind of problem here?

43:52.656 --> 43:57.325
No problem. Dr. Helburn needs
to have his oil changed.

43:57.327 --> 43:58.025
Oh, I see.

43:58.027 --> 44:01.728
Usually that doesn't require
such a lengthy consultation.

44:01.730 --> 44:05.364
Rose was being very thorough.

44:05.366 --> 44:06.698
Was rose?

44:06.700 --> 44:11.235
Dr. Helburn, come in
tomorrow morning at 8:00.

44:11.237 --> 44:14.338
We'll get you started.
I look forward to it.

44:14.340 --> 44:17.374
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll get that for you.

44:17.376 --> 44:18.641
Whoa! Made it worse.

44:18.643 --> 44:23.512
Get that in the morning.
Nice wheels. Thanks.

44:27.918 --> 44:29.050
Why was he touching you?

44:29.052 --> 44:32.019
He wasn't touching me.
He was just... gesturing.

44:32.021 --> 44:34.287
- He was caressing.
- Phil, for God's sake!

44:34.289 --> 44:38.190
I didn't think you'd want to invoke God,
rose, because he saw even more than I did.

44:38.192 --> 44:42.894
Look, Phil, if you want the rights of
a husband, you're gonna have to ask.

44:42.896 --> 44:47.698
But if not, you're gonna have to get
accustomed to the rights of what you are.

44:47.700 --> 44:50.467
Oh? What's that?

44:50.469 --> 44:52.101
Right now?

44:52.103 --> 44:56.872
An intimate boarder
with mechanical skills.

44:56.874 --> 45:00.342
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

45:00.344 --> 45:01.910
How's the investigation going?

45:01.912 --> 45:06.114
- Just call us the dead end kids.
- May I use the phone?

45:06.116 --> 45:09.450
Sure. Help yourself.

45:10.519 --> 45:13.887
Anyone with taste,
with breeding...

45:13.889 --> 45:18.725
a gentleman would choose
British racing green...

45:18.727 --> 45:21.594
With maybe a tan interior.

45:21.596 --> 45:23.963
But when you buy a red car...

45:23.965 --> 45:26.765
With a black interior
and wire wheels,

45:26.767 --> 45:28.299
you have only one thing
on your mind,

45:28.301 --> 45:31.669
and I'm too much of a gentleman
to say what that one thing is

45:31.671 --> 45:34.071
in front of the children.

45:36.375 --> 45:39.809
Even if I am
just a glorified boarder.

45:39.811 --> 45:40.311
<i>¶</i>

45:45.883 --> 45:46.383
<i>¶ ¶</i>

45:50.554 --> 45:55.123
hi. I'd like the number for
Stanley rosenfeld photo studios.

45:55.125 --> 45:59.127
<i>¶ Close your eyes</i>
<i>and I'll kiss you</i>

45:59.129 --> 46:00.728
<i>¶ tomorrow I'll miss you ¶</i>

46:00.730 --> 46:05.532
photography is an art form
if you take it seriously,

46:05.534 --> 46:06.733
which I happen to do.

46:06.735 --> 46:10.937
Esther, you gorgeous thing, you!
Smile for the birdie.

46:10.939 --> 46:14.941
- Hold, hold!
- Stomach in, Harold.

46:14.943 --> 46:16.075
Beautiful!

46:16.077 --> 46:18.177
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

46:18.179 --> 46:24.082
Your mother was special.
I had quite a crush on her.

46:24.084 --> 46:25.049
Really?

46:25.051 --> 46:25.649
Who didn't?

46:25.651 --> 46:28.918
She could play basketball like Jerry
west, danced like cyd charisse.

46:28.920 --> 46:32.221
She'd look at you with those big, blue eyes!
Forget about it!

46:32.223 --> 46:36.825
I asked her out a couple
times, but she always said no.

46:36.827 --> 46:39.494
Lenny, Nancy,
you just got married!

46:39.496 --> 46:42.730
Look happy!
Look like you mean it.

46:42.732 --> 46:44.331
Beautiful!

46:44.333 --> 46:46.933
I remember those days.
We all went to ucla.

46:46.935 --> 46:49.602
She started hanging around with
those drama department types.

46:49.604 --> 46:54.773
One guy, Peter webb, has become
a big director in Hollywood.

46:54.775 --> 46:59.277
The reason I know him is we
were in this poetry class...

46:59.279 --> 47:03.214
With this crazy guy,
Albert boderfelder.

47:03.216 --> 47:04.949
Beidermeyer?

47:04.951 --> 47:08.085
Beidermeyer, that's it!
What a mad man!

47:08.087 --> 47:10.854
- He's a great poet!
- He is?

47:10.856 --> 47:12.455
Did you know him?

47:12.457 --> 47:13.022
Everybody did.

47:13.024 --> 47:17.626
Walk along citrus between fountain
and sunset any afternoon.

47:17.628 --> 47:19.227
He'll remember my mother
for sure.

47:19.229 --> 47:23.097
It was a big class,
vada, and...

47:23.099 --> 47:26.166
of course he'll remember.
Who could forget Maggie?

47:26.168 --> 47:32.305
Just one more thing. Does
this mean anything to you?

47:32.974 --> 47:36.141
No, it doesn't,
but I wish it did.

47:36.143 --> 47:39.144
Well, thanks for your help,
Mr. Rosenfeld.

47:39.146 --> 47:41.646
I'm sorry my mother
wouldn't go out with you.

47:41.648 --> 47:44.281
I'm sure she would've had
a great time.

47:44.283 --> 47:45.915
I would have tried
to show her a good time.

47:45.917 --> 47:50.352
I promised when she left I would
never forget her, and I never did.

47:50.354 --> 47:54.856
Stanley rosenfeld
does not forget.

47:57.093 --> 47:58.926
This is the street
he walks down every day.

47:58.928 --> 48:04.097
- When he needs inspiration...
- Boy, you're really into this!

48:04.099 --> 48:07.433
He is one of the great poets.

48:12.039 --> 48:15.006
I think it's him.

48:23.683 --> 48:26.050
He's writing.

48:30.956 --> 48:32.021
Hello?

48:32.023 --> 48:37.359
If you're selling girl scout
cookies, I'm borderline diabetic.

48:37.361 --> 48:40.362
You're Alfred beidermeyer,
aren't you?

48:40.364 --> 48:43.598
You had to remind me?

48:43.600 --> 48:44.932
Are you writing a poem?

48:44.934 --> 48:46.733
No, I'm writing
the phone company...

48:46.735 --> 48:51.504
Because they keep charging me for
calls to caracas, Venezuela.

48:51.506 --> 48:54.473
Do you know anybody
in caracas, Venezuela?

48:54.475 --> 48:56.007
- No.
- No.

48:56.009 --> 48:59.410
Neither do I.

48:59.412 --> 49:02.713
"Ask not for whom
the bell tolls."

49:02.715 --> 49:06.850
Time for my medication
and my nap.

49:06.852 --> 49:08.184
Ooh!

49:08.186 --> 49:09.985
We'll help you carry
this stuff.

49:09.987 --> 49:13.621
I can handle it.
I can handle that!

49:14.357 --> 49:18.525
Oh, thank you.
I'm in the penthouse.

49:23.331 --> 49:28.067
Penthouse "a."
It's over on the left.

49:36.143 --> 49:42.380
If he has a heart attack, you're
carrying the body down yourself.

49:47.052 --> 49:50.453
At least it gives you
plenty of exercise.

49:50.455 --> 49:53.122
It keeps me young.

49:59.063 --> 50:02.364
Um, where do you want this?

50:02.366 --> 50:05.600
Just put it over there.

50:09.072 --> 50:10.571
Do you still teach? No, no.

50:10.573 --> 50:15.509
I gave it up ten years ago.
Actually, it gave me up.

50:15.511 --> 50:19.379
My mother took this course
with you at ucla:

50:19.381 --> 50:21.280
"Foundations of
poetic thought."

50:21.282 --> 50:25.350
Ucla?
My cardigan sweater period!

50:25.352 --> 50:27.585
Her name was Maggie muldovan.

50:27.587 --> 50:28.385
Oh.

50:28.387 --> 50:33.089
- Remember her?
- I've been blessed with a very bad memory.

50:33.091 --> 50:35.291
People say she looked like me.

50:35.293 --> 50:40.462
I was drinking a little
in those days.

50:40.464 --> 50:43.731
I'm drinking a little
these days too.

50:43.733 --> 50:47.735
I'm sure she found
your lectures fascinating.

50:47.737 --> 50:49.069
Oh, I doubt it.

50:49.071 --> 50:53.773
Writers are notoriously boring.

50:53.775 --> 50:54.974
No, they're not.

50:54.976 --> 51:00.813
I want to be a writer. I
want to be just like you.

51:03.884 --> 51:06.084
Me? My dear,

51:06.086 --> 51:09.420
this is not a country
that rewards poetry.

51:09.422 --> 51:12.589
This is a country
that rewards gas mileage.

51:12.591 --> 51:17.126
Besides, people don't read
poetry anymore.

51:17.128 --> 51:19.027
They watch television.

51:19.029 --> 51:25.199
Don't be a poet.
Be a TV repairman!

51:43.819 --> 51:45.585
Vada, c'mon.

51:45.587 --> 51:49.855
Got a place I always go
when I need cheering up.

51:53.760 --> 51:58.062
The tar pits? This is where
you come to get cheered up?

51:58.064 --> 52:00.964
Look at it this way.
However bad I feel,

52:00.966 --> 52:05.234
it isn't as bad as becoming extinct
in a bottomless pit of tar.

52:05.236 --> 52:08.136
And I thought I was weird!

52:08.138 --> 52:10.238
You are weird.

52:10.240 --> 52:13.741
- Let's just go.
- No, wait.

52:13.743 --> 52:15.909
I like that
you brought me here.

52:15.911 --> 52:20.880
Hey, what do I care?
I mean, consider the source:

52:20.882 --> 52:25.484
A chick from Pennsylvania
who wears a mood ring.

52:25.486 --> 52:27.819
This isn't just a mood ring.

52:27.821 --> 52:29.620
Does it work?

52:29.622 --> 52:32.889
It doesn't open cans
or anything,

52:32.891 --> 52:39.395
but it's sort of a reminder
of a friend of mine.

52:39.397 --> 52:40.896
Boyfriend?

52:40.898 --> 52:45.133
He was a boy. He was my friend.

52:45.135 --> 52:49.070
He was my best friend.

52:49.072 --> 52:55.876
When we were kids, we were gonna move
out here and live with the Brady bunch.

52:59.248 --> 53:03.016
Then I lost this ring
in the woods.

53:03.018 --> 53:06.252
And when he went to find it,

53:06.254 --> 53:10.956
he got stung by bees
and he died.

53:12.192 --> 53:15.226
Do you think your friend's
up in heaven now,

53:15.228 --> 53:18.896
lookin' down on you and
watching you all the time?

53:18.898 --> 53:25.736
Well, I hope he's not
watching me all the time.

53:29.842 --> 53:33.643
Let me see if
it changes colors on me.

53:33.645 --> 53:35.611
Okay.

53:35.613 --> 53:37.746
But be careful.

53:37.748 --> 53:40.715
It has a lot of
sentimental value.

53:40.717 --> 53:43.684
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.

53:43.686 --> 53:45.787
Don't force it.
You'll break it.

53:45.789 --> 53:49.257
I'm not gonna break it. I just
want to see it change colors.

53:49.259 --> 53:52.460
I want it back now. I never
should've taken it off.

53:52.462 --> 53:54.862
I want it back. -Relax.
I'm not gonna break it.

53:54.864 --> 53:56.830
Give it to me. Come and get it!

53:56.832 --> 54:01.534
Just give it to me!
Just come and get it.

54:01.536 --> 54:05.971
Don't! Come on! Watch it!

54:08.308 --> 54:09.173
Uh-oh.

54:09.175 --> 54:12.776
What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

54:12.778 --> 54:15.945
I dropped it.

54:15.947 --> 54:17.947
In the tar?

54:17.949 --> 54:21.850
It was an accident.
I'll get you a new one.

54:21.852 --> 54:25.520
Where are you going?

54:26.222 --> 54:29.323
Vada, wait up! Wait!

54:32.961 --> 54:35.728
What are you doing?
You can't go in there.

54:35.730 --> 54:36.462
Oh, no?

54:36.464 --> 54:39.965
- It's dangerous.
- Leave me alone!

54:40.500 --> 54:44.802
That ring is the only thing I have
left of Thomas j. I have to get it!

54:44.804 --> 54:48.172
You mean this ring?

54:52.378 --> 54:54.611
Jerk! You idiot!

54:54.613 --> 54:58.114
You hit pretty good...
For a girl.

55:26.177 --> 55:29.044
Nicholas!

55:29.046 --> 55:31.646
What are you doing up?

55:31.648 --> 55:32.980
Uh, I...

55:32.982 --> 55:37.684
I'm thirsty. There's
water in your bathroom.

55:37.686 --> 55:39.752
I want juice.

55:39.754 --> 55:43.956
Don't wake up vada. I won't.

55:55.569 --> 55:59.671
I think Maggie could've
been a major player.

55:59.673 --> 56:00.571
She had talent.

56:00.573 --> 56:03.073
God knows, that face
was made for close-ups.

56:03.075 --> 56:06.176
Everything was magic
with Maggie!

56:06.178 --> 56:08.678
I remember walking down
Hollywood boulevard.

56:08.680 --> 56:12.348
We put our feet in the stars'
footprints like tourists do.

56:12.350 --> 56:18.087
Maggie could not believe it. Her feet
were the same size as Judy garland.

56:18.089 --> 56:20.923
Mine matched perfectly
with Orson welles'.

56:20.925 --> 56:23.759
Just kidding.

56:24.962 --> 56:27.929
You should call
Hillary Mitchell.

56:27.931 --> 56:29.764
She and Maggie were very close.

56:29.766 --> 56:33.400
She's got this funky
clothing store on Melrose.

56:33.402 --> 56:38.037
I'd call her for you, but we kind
of had this thing, you know.

56:38.039 --> 56:42.041
It got a little messy!

56:42.043 --> 56:43.042
Thanks.

56:43.044 --> 56:47.679
Would you know what this is?

56:47.681 --> 56:48.880
Well, not really.

56:48.882 --> 56:51.449
Could be the date of
an opening, an audition.

56:51.451 --> 56:55.553
Uh, birthday? Hmm?
Not my birthday.

56:55.555 --> 56:58.889
I don't know. Who writes
dates on paper bags?

56:58.891 --> 56:59.923
My mom.

56:59.925 --> 57:04.160
Whoa! I have got to get the dailies.
Gotta break this up.

57:04.162 --> 57:07.496
Thanks for your time.
I know you're very busy.

57:07.498 --> 57:09.965
You are Maggie all over again!

57:09.967 --> 57:12.734
Let me know if you ever
want to be a movie star.

57:12.736 --> 57:17.872
- You've got the face for close-ups too.
- Thanks.

57:24.547 --> 57:27.347
What a dufus!

57:31.586 --> 57:35.688
We may go for coffee after. Don't
expect us before midnight.

57:35.690 --> 57:38.357
There's plenty of fruit. -You know
where the fire extinguisher is.

57:38.359 --> 57:42.761
If the fruit bursts into
flames, I'll be prepared.

57:42.763 --> 57:45.063
You're so clever!

57:45.065 --> 57:46.898
Are you all right?

57:46.900 --> 57:47.431
I'm just tired.

57:47.433 --> 57:51.001
Well, get to bed early,
and don't let anybody in.

57:51.003 --> 57:53.670
- Bye.
- Lock the door.

58:08.820 --> 58:11.320
We have liftoff.

58:11.322 --> 58:14.256
Joan Crawford! I love her.

58:14.258 --> 58:15.757
There's the Marx brothers.

58:15.759 --> 58:21.896
Carole lombard. My dad's favorite.
Never heard of her.

58:21.898 --> 58:25.833
Montgomery clift!
Wait 'til I tell Shelly.

58:25.835 --> 58:28.302
Here's Judy garland!

58:32.308 --> 58:34.274
My mother stood
on this very spot.

58:34.276 --> 58:37.810
I'm afraid your feet won't fit.

58:39.880 --> 58:44.549
That's 'cause I was cursed
with sultenfuss bear claws.

58:46.986 --> 58:48.185
My hands fit.

58:48.187 --> 58:50.487
Big deal.

58:54.292 --> 58:56.091
What's he smoking?

58:56.093 --> 58:58.693
What do you think?

58:58.695 --> 59:01.195
Really?

59:08.337 --> 59:10.403
Hey, look.

59:17.812 --> 59:22.781
This is a totally
barbaric custom.

59:23.650 --> 59:29.487
So, if Phil marries my mom, she'd
be your aunt, right? -Right.

59:29.489 --> 59:32.223
And you'd be my cousin?

59:32.225 --> 59:36.293
Yeah, I guess. Sort of.

59:36.295 --> 59:39.896
But we wouldn't really
be related, right?

59:39.898 --> 59:43.566
Oh, no. We wouldn't be from the
same bloodlines or anything.

59:43.568 --> 59:45.901
We'd be like two
total strangers,

59:45.903 --> 59:50.472
who accidentally had relatives
who got married.

59:50.474 --> 59:53.441
Good. I mean...

59:53.676 --> 59:57.577
marriage can really
complicate things.

59:59.147 --> 01:00:03.749
So, aren't you going to say
anything about my earrings?

01:00:03.751 --> 01:00:08.453
I already did. It's a
totally barbaric custom.

01:00:08.455 --> 01:00:10.755
But on you...

01:00:10.757 --> 01:00:14.024
It looks good.

01:00:31.877 --> 01:00:35.712
We should've called.
It's not that late.

01:00:43.822 --> 01:00:48.925
- You're grounded 'til you're 50.
- You're overreacting.

01:00:48.927 --> 01:00:53.095
Make that 60. And I'm
docking your allowance.

01:00:53.097 --> 01:00:54.596
You think this is easy for me?

01:00:54.598 --> 01:00:57.131
You go on the town
and I get to be the bad guy.

01:00:57.133 --> 01:00:58.866
I don't want you to be
some punk hoodlum.

01:00:58.868 --> 01:01:02.135
I can't do my job as a parent if
you don't do your job as a kid.

01:01:02.137 --> 01:01:04.971
- It's not his fault.
- No. It was me.

01:01:04.973 --> 01:01:10.643
I'm sorry, mom. Tell me what to do.
I'll do anything.

01:01:10.645 --> 01:01:12.945
Go to your room.

01:01:13.113 --> 01:01:18.583
And you, I don't suppose your father
gave you permission to Pierce your ears.

01:01:18.585 --> 01:01:20.751
Not exactly.

01:01:20.753 --> 01:01:22.719
Well, just don't
shave your legs.

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:28.157
He'll never let you visit again if I send
you home hairless and full of holes.

01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:53.982
- Good morning.
- Maybe for you.

01:01:53.984 --> 01:01:54.615
Something wrong?

01:01:54.617 --> 01:01:58.719
Let's say you're lucky you deal
with kids under anesthesia.

01:01:59.588 --> 01:02:01.621
Even without anesthesia,

01:02:01.623 --> 01:02:06.926
I tell my patients to... relax.

01:02:07.428 --> 01:02:09.628
Isn't it time for
your coffee break?

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:14.866
There must be someplace we can go, talk.
Oh, no, I couldn't.

01:02:14.868 --> 01:02:17.869
- You couldn't?
- I'm sort of involved.

01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:22.540
Sort of. -Let's just say...
I'm involved.

01:02:22.542 --> 01:02:27.378
Where I come from, involvement
calls for a piece of jewelry.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:31.415
Oh, I don't wear
a lot of jewelry.

01:02:31.417 --> 01:02:33.116
All right,
so you don't like jewelry.

01:02:33.118 --> 01:02:37.854
But you do like good music.
Liszt, one of my favorites.

01:02:37.856 --> 01:02:42.191
Liszt was my parents' favorite.
They were Hungarian.

01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:43.058
Hungarian.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:47.695
Famous for their beautiful
music, their beautiful women.

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:51.031
Dr. Helburn! What a surprise!

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:55.502
Last couple of days we've changed
your oil, relined your brakes,

01:02:55.504 --> 01:02:57.704
balanced and rotated
your tires,

01:02:57.706 --> 01:03:01.641
aligned your front end and
flushed out your cooling system.

01:03:01.643 --> 01:03:04.744
I didn't expect to be seeing
you for another 3,000 Miles.

01:03:04.746 --> 01:03:08.881
What can I say, Phil?
I feel so welcome here.

01:03:08.883 --> 01:03:11.550
And you are.

01:03:13.453 --> 01:03:16.420
Why don't I come in first
thing in the morning?

01:03:16.422 --> 01:03:20.724
You can check out that left blinker for me.
Oh, sure, okay.

01:03:20.726 --> 01:03:25.662
I'll see you then.
I look forward to it.

01:03:35.306 --> 01:03:41.310
We really oughta flush out that
line of bullshit he's got.

01:03:41.312 --> 01:03:44.713
"Hungarians are famous
for their beautiful women."

01:03:44.715 --> 01:03:48.883
What's wrong with a little
flattery, a little appreciation?

01:03:48.885 --> 01:03:54.555
I don't appreciate? I'm saying, he asked
me out for coffee like a real date.

01:03:54.557 --> 01:03:57.291
- When was the last time you did that?
- What do you mean?

01:03:57.293 --> 01:04:03.397
We have a date every night. -That's not a date.
A date is when I don't cook.

01:04:05.501 --> 01:04:08.368
I do the dishes.

01:04:10.705 --> 01:04:12.071
I'd go to a fortune teller,

01:04:12.073 --> 01:04:14.506
but they can only predict
the future.

01:04:14.508 --> 01:04:19.477
I need someone
who can predict the past.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.354
Hi. Can I help you?

01:04:30.356 --> 01:04:35.258
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who
went to school with Maggie muldovan?

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:40.563
Maggie muldovan!
Did you know her?

01:04:40.565 --> 01:04:42.898
She's her daughter, vada.

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:46.635
Of course!

01:04:46.637 --> 01:04:48.603
Oh, look at you.

01:04:48.605 --> 01:04:53.641
It's the eyes, mostly,
and the hair too.

01:04:53.643 --> 01:04:57.411
And now she's gone. She's gone.

01:04:57.413 --> 01:05:02.048
She'll never get to see
how well you've turned out.

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:06.685
Oh! Oh, my God!

01:05:06.687 --> 01:05:11.423
Maggie! You poor thing!

01:05:11.425 --> 01:05:17.362
It's okay, really.
I was just a baby.

01:05:17.364 --> 01:05:19.764
I'm sorry, it's just...

01:05:19.766 --> 01:05:25.870
I've been taking seminars to
get in touch with my feelings,

01:05:25.872 --> 01:05:29.340
and sometimes it gets
out of hand.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.308
Here.

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:36.146
Thank you! You're very sweet.

01:05:37.182 --> 01:05:39.916
How did you find out
where I was?

01:05:39.918 --> 01:05:41.951
Peter webb told us.

01:05:42.386 --> 01:05:44.719
Peter?

01:05:44.721 --> 01:05:47.221
You saw Peter?

01:05:47.223 --> 01:05:50.591
Oh, God!

01:05:59.935 --> 01:06:04.170
Oh, forgive me.
I'm making such a scene.

01:06:04.172 --> 01:06:07.273
Why don't you have a seat?
Thanks.

01:06:07.275 --> 01:06:10.509
I remember Maggie,
and your dad too.

01:06:10.511 --> 01:06:16.147
We used to pile into
his old '54 Ford pickup.

01:06:16.149 --> 01:06:19.316
"Chuck the truck,"
we used to call it.

01:06:19.318 --> 01:06:24.120
It was pitch black
with red leather interior.

01:06:24.122 --> 01:06:26.122
Does he still drive that?

01:06:26.124 --> 01:06:30.326
No, but sometimes
he drives a hearse.

01:06:30.328 --> 01:06:33.495
He's an undertaker.

01:06:33.497 --> 01:06:34.662
You're kidding.

01:06:34.664 --> 01:06:38.332
Jeffrey pommeroy's
an undertaker?

01:06:39.568 --> 01:06:43.403
His name's Harry sultenfuss.

01:06:43.405 --> 01:06:45.738
Oh!

01:06:47.174 --> 01:06:48.206
Oh.

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:51.209
What are you saying?

01:06:51.211 --> 01:06:53.244
Um, look, I...

01:06:53.246 --> 01:06:56.347
are you saying my mom
had another husband?

01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:57.948
Oh, honey.

01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:00.150
Back then,
people did crazy things.

01:07:00.152 --> 01:07:04.988
They sure did! They got kicked out of school.
They married truck drivers!

01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:07.790
These are my mother's
greatest accomplishments?

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:12.327
I'm sure glad I came all the
way out here to find them out.

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:24.071
Vada, wait up!

01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:26.740
Just because your mother
was married before...

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:29.576
it doesn't mean anything.

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:34.380
Maybe not. But maybe it does.

01:07:34.382 --> 01:07:36.382
If no one told me about this...

01:07:36.384 --> 01:07:42.488
maybe they're trying to hide something.
Like what?

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:47.059
Maybe this Jeffrey guy
is my real father.

01:07:47.394 --> 01:07:50.395
I mean, look at me.

01:07:50.397 --> 01:07:53.264
I have the hair
of a dead person.

01:07:53.266 --> 01:07:54.431
And my nose.

01:07:54.433 --> 01:07:58.134
No one in my family
has this nose.

01:07:58.136 --> 01:08:01.537
It could be the nose
of a complete stranger.

01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:02.170
I mean...

01:08:02.172 --> 01:08:07.108
I came out here to find out
about my mother, and I found...

01:08:07.110 --> 01:08:09.009
oh, God.

01:08:09.378 --> 01:08:12.645
Don't cry.

01:08:12.647 --> 01:08:14.513
Come on.

01:08:14.515 --> 01:08:17.749
The lady in there
looked pretty flaky to me.

01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:21.152
How about Phil? Maybe he knows
something about all this.

01:08:21.154 --> 01:08:26.991
At least you should talk to
him before you get worked up.

01:08:27.393 --> 01:08:30.292
Before I get worked up?

01:08:30.295 --> 01:08:35.096
You don't think
this is worked up?

01:08:41.171 --> 01:08:44.071
That thing you said
about your nose?

01:08:44.206 --> 01:08:47.506
It was a stranger's nose?

01:08:47.509 --> 01:08:51.143
Well, it's not. I mean...

01:08:51.145 --> 01:08:55.947
it's yours! You know?

01:08:56.916 --> 01:09:00.984
- Nick?
- Yeah?

01:09:01.252 --> 01:09:06.321
This has been
a real confusing day.

01:09:08.825 --> 01:09:13.460
How could dad let me visit
here and find out like this?

01:09:16.298 --> 01:09:20.899
I'm going to call him and
make him tell me everything.

01:09:20.902 --> 01:09:22.401
Ah, sweetie, I wouldn't...

01:09:22.403 --> 01:09:26.738
don't worry, I'll do it
in my own subtle way.

01:09:32.178 --> 01:09:33.911
Hello? Sultenfuss parlor.

01:09:33.912 --> 01:09:36.380
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, honey!

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:39.950
I just called to say
I'm having a great time.

01:09:39.952 --> 01:09:44.421
Good. You should go over
and watch them tape Carson.

01:09:44.423 --> 01:09:48.925
Actually, I want
to see Jeffrey pommeroy.

01:09:48.926 --> 01:09:53.229
Is he some kind of
new rock star or something?

01:09:54.599 --> 01:09:55.464
Yeah.

01:09:55.466 --> 01:09:57.933
- Totally groovy, huh?
- Totally.

01:09:57.935 --> 01:10:00.368
Ask him if he needs
a good tuba player.

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:04.939
I will. How's Shelly?

01:10:04.941 --> 01:10:06.407
Ah, she's fine.

01:10:06.409 --> 01:10:12.446
The doctor told her to stay in
bed, get rest and stay quiet...

01:10:12.448 --> 01:10:15.215
To make sure that...

01:10:15.217 --> 01:10:16.616
okay.

01:10:16.618 --> 01:10:18.250
Bye, daddy. I love you.

01:10:18.252 --> 01:10:22.587
I love you too, sweetie.
Bye. -Love to Shelly.

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:33.697
Shelly's sick. I have to get to the
bottom of this and get back there.

01:10:33.699 --> 01:10:36.099
She'll be all right, baby.

01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:38.034
Yeah. Right.

01:10:38.036 --> 01:10:40.770
It's pointless to worry.

01:10:40.772 --> 01:10:45.574
- I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
- His name is Jeffrey pommeroy.

01:10:45.576 --> 01:10:51.079
He used to drive a '54 Ford
pickup, black with red interior.

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.280
Please?

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:57.385
Give us a break. All you have
to do is make a phone call.

01:10:57.387 --> 01:11:01.555
I thought I told you
to lose this guy.

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.323
Look, sergeant,

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:07.226
I know I said some things
last time I shouldn't have.

01:11:07.228 --> 01:11:09.828
I think the phrase
was "sleazoid geek."

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:11.262
I'm sorry. Okay?

01:11:11.264 --> 01:11:15.299
We gotta find this guy
because he knew vada's mom.

01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:17.668
He could tell her stuff
that no one else knows.

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.136
You're still asking me
to break the law. -No.

01:11:19.138 --> 01:11:24.541
We're asking you to stand up with Maggie
muldovan like you should've years ago.

01:11:34.319 --> 01:11:37.653
Yeah, this is sgt. Tanaka
from hollenbeck.

01:11:37.655 --> 01:11:41.089
I need a current address
for a Jeffrey...

01:11:41.091 --> 01:11:42.256
pommeroy.

01:11:42.258 --> 01:11:43.190
Pommeroy.

01:11:43.192 --> 01:11:47.527
He may or may not be driving
a black '54 Ford pickup.

01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:50.929
Monday.

01:11:50.931 --> 01:11:54.098
I'm leaving Sunday.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.699
Could you hold on for a second?

01:11:55.701 --> 01:12:00.904
Look, I can't get priority
without a criminal charge.

01:12:00.906 --> 01:12:04.607
So, charge him with something.
Who's gonna know?

01:12:04.609 --> 01:12:05.808
Me! I'll know!

01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:09.411
Do you want to be
a hall monitor all your life?

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:17.318
Hello. I'm going
to need this right now!

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.287
This guy,

01:12:20.289 --> 01:12:23.890
well, we think he might be
going after the governor.

01:12:26.327 --> 01:12:29.895
Twenty minutes? Fine.

01:12:33.133 --> 01:12:37.502
So, give him a call. The worst
he can do is hang up on you.

01:12:37.504 --> 01:12:42.874
I feel like before I can talk
to him, I have to see his face.

01:12:44.244 --> 01:12:46.277
How's this for a solution?

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:49.546
We'll take a drive
over to his place.

01:12:49.548 --> 01:12:54.284
You can introduce yourself. -I'd
like to see his house, but...

01:12:54.286 --> 01:12:58.955
I don't know if I'd have the
nerve to just knock on his door.

01:12:58.957 --> 01:13:02.825
I don't think I can
go through with it.

01:13:02.827 --> 01:13:06.829
Then we'll keep driving.
You'll decide.

01:13:06.831 --> 01:13:10.132
<i>¶ ¶</i>

01:13:17.107 --> 01:13:19.407
you're awfully quiet.

01:13:20.143 --> 01:13:24.879
Do you think I should tell my
dad about Jeffrey pommeroy?

01:13:25.715 --> 01:13:29.083
I don't know. He's got an awful
lot on his mind right now.

01:13:29.085 --> 01:13:33.387
Maybe someday
when the time is right.

01:13:33.389 --> 01:13:35.722
Maybe.

01:13:35.724 --> 01:13:36.756
Then again,

01:13:36.758 --> 01:13:40.760
your dad's got his own
memories and his own life now.

01:13:40.762 --> 01:13:46.966
I think this is a secret just
between you and your mom.

01:13:47.535 --> 01:13:51.570
A secret. I like that.

01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:24.235
This is it, I guess.

01:14:29.408 --> 01:14:31.975
Well, we've come this far.

01:14:31.977 --> 01:14:35.244
The least I can do
is knock on the door.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:40.849
Want me to come with?
I should do this myself.

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:43.184
Okay. Take your time.

01:14:43.186 --> 01:14:46.253
I'll go for a walk around.

01:15:19.087 --> 01:15:22.388
Go ahead, honey. Go ahead.

01:15:36.703 --> 01:15:38.402
Hi, there.

01:15:40.105 --> 01:15:41.304
Can I help you?

01:15:41.306 --> 01:15:44.573
Are you Jeffrey pommeroy?

01:15:44.575 --> 01:15:48.076
I sure am. Who are you?

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.446
I'm vada Margaret sultenfuss.

01:15:52.448 --> 01:15:54.247
My mother was...

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:58.217
Maggie.
You're Maggie's little girl.

01:15:59.753 --> 01:16:03.955
I was hopin'
I'd get to meet ya.

01:16:04.457 --> 01:16:05.556
You mean...

01:16:05.558 --> 01:16:06.423
You knew about me?

01:16:06.425 --> 01:16:11.961
Who is it, honey? -It's
Maggie's girl, vada.

01:16:12.029 --> 01:16:14.596
Oh! Oh, my.

01:16:14.598 --> 01:16:16.931
This is my wife Emily. -Hi.

01:16:16.933 --> 01:16:18.465
Hi.

01:16:18.467 --> 01:16:22.502
Um, can you come in
for a minute?

01:16:22.504 --> 01:16:26.172
I'd like to. Thanks.

01:16:31.979 --> 01:16:38.049
Mommy, daddy, I painted you
a rainbow. Come and see!

01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:41.986
This is vada.
This is our little girl Katie.

01:16:41.988 --> 01:16:43.220
Hi.

01:16:43.222 --> 01:16:44.020
Hi.

01:16:44.022 --> 01:16:49.392
Um, why don't we let daddy
and vada visit for a while?

01:16:49.394 --> 01:16:51.794
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:16:51.796 --> 01:16:55.130
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:16:55.532 --> 01:17:02.236
- She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
- Does she?

01:17:03.806 --> 01:17:05.472
I'm glad you're here.

01:17:05.474 --> 01:17:06.573
You are?

01:17:06.575 --> 01:17:10.677
Yeah. Come on, let's talk.

01:17:11.513 --> 01:17:17.550
We had this school assignment to write about
somebody we never met. I chose my mother.

01:17:17.552 --> 01:17:18.651
She was born in Los Angeles.

01:17:18.653 --> 01:17:21.487
And since my Uncle Phil moved
out here, I came to visit him.

01:17:21.489 --> 01:17:24.389
I looked in her high school
yearbook and called people.

01:17:24.391 --> 01:17:29.327
One guy said she went to ucla, another
said I should call Hillary Mitchell...

01:17:29.329 --> 01:17:31.729
Hillary Mitchell! How's she?

01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:34.598
She's great.
She's a little crazy, though.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.400
Hillary said you had
a black Ford truck.

01:17:37.402 --> 01:17:41.604
And this policeman I know got
in touch with motor vehicles.

01:17:41.606 --> 01:17:45.074
He gave me your address.
And here I am.

01:17:45.543 --> 01:17:48.176
I told you it was a long story.
That's all right.

01:17:48.178 --> 01:17:52.446
You sounded just like your mother.
She told great stories.

01:17:52.448 --> 01:17:57.017
Stories with crazy accents
and special effects.

01:17:57.019 --> 01:17:58.618
- Special effects?
- Yeah.

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.188
Like switching a lamp on and off when
she was talking about lightning.

01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:04.323
Audiences love stuff like that.

01:18:04.325 --> 01:18:06.725
And your mom knew how
to work an audience.

01:18:06.727 --> 01:18:09.160
I don't know
very much about her.

01:18:09.162 --> 01:18:11.862
I was hoping
that you could help me.

01:18:11.864 --> 01:18:13.663
I'll try.

01:18:15.466 --> 01:18:18.366
No one else
knows what this means.

01:18:27.977 --> 01:18:30.043
See...

01:18:30.045 --> 01:18:33.112
We always wanted to work
in the theater...

01:18:33.114 --> 01:18:35.814
So we drove out to New York,

01:18:35.816 --> 01:18:38.416
to Broadway where it was,

01:18:38.418 --> 01:18:40.251
where it was all happening.

01:18:40.253 --> 01:18:44.855
New York was just full
of fancy French restaurants,

01:18:44.857 --> 01:18:46.890
and we wanted
to get married in one.

01:18:46.892 --> 01:18:48.358
But we were totally broke.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:54.297
Your mom found this little coffee shop
with tables and real tablecloths,

01:18:54.299 --> 01:18:57.667
and a minister
who worked cheap.

01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:58.968
When we got to the coffee shop,

01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:03.372
there was a sign on the door that said,
"closed by the board of health."

01:19:03.374 --> 01:19:06.041
By that time it had
started snowing,

01:19:06.043 --> 01:19:11.980
so we just got married
right outside in the snow.

01:19:11.982 --> 01:19:14.716
It was freezing.

01:19:14.718 --> 01:19:16.984
But it was wonderful.

01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:24.257
For a wedding feast, we had a
bag of hot roasted chestnuts.

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:26.993
This is the bag.

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:29.395
She saved it.

01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:31.731
We didn't have a camera,

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:38.471
so she just wrote the date on the bag and
said, "this will be our wedding album.

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:42.708
This will be a day
we'll never forget."

01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:45.811
We never did.

01:19:49.016 --> 01:19:51.349
Do you have
any pictures of her?

01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:55.119
I've got something better.

01:20:00.226 --> 01:20:04.962
We called ourselves "the
appearing-nightly players."

01:20:06.865 --> 01:20:10.900
Darling, where is my chauffeur?

01:20:10.902 --> 01:20:12.868
You don't want I should
walk to the stage,

01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:17.272
an actress of my
overwhelming talent.

01:20:22.779 --> 01:20:25.846
She's beautiful!

01:20:33.255 --> 01:20:36.456
We performed on the beach
one summer.

01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:40.059
Everything went wrong.

01:21:27.775 --> 01:21:32.210
- Send me away happy.
- Send him away!

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:40.184
<i>¶ Smile though your heart</i>
<i>is aching</i>

01:21:40.186 --> 01:21:46.056
<i>¶ smile even though</i>

01:21:46.058 --> 01:21:49.526

01:23:07.095 --> 01:23:08.427
That was beautiful.

01:23:08.429 --> 01:23:11.663
Thanks. You do it.
You do it all the time.

01:23:11.665 --> 01:23:15.366
That was beautiful. -Thank you.

01:23:36.588 --> 01:23:40.022
She had a... Beautiful voice.

01:23:43.594 --> 01:23:48.129
Would you like to have
these movies?

01:23:50.466 --> 01:23:54.835
Ah... more than anything
in the world.

01:23:55.938 --> 01:23:59.739
It's good to see
Maggie again... and you.

01:23:59.741 --> 01:24:03.976
Didn't you ever wonder
about me?

01:24:03.978 --> 01:24:08.113
I didn't know about you
until after she was gone.

01:24:08.115 --> 01:24:14.552
I thought that maybe you'd be
curious about how I turned out.

01:24:14.554 --> 01:24:17.354
I'd say you turned out
just fine.

01:24:17.356 --> 01:24:18.355
What I mean is,

01:24:18.357 --> 01:24:22.559
my mother married my dad after
you, and then I was born.

01:24:22.561 --> 01:24:25.695
I thought maybe you got
divorced because of me.

01:24:25.697 --> 01:24:27.930
Wait, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute.

01:24:27.932 --> 01:24:31.600
Do you think I'm your father?

01:24:31.602 --> 01:24:33.401
Well...

01:24:33.403 --> 01:24:37.671
honey, I'd be proud
to be your father.

01:24:37.673 --> 01:24:39.406
Really.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:44.444
It just isn't so.

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:55.554
Maggie wanted to have a baby.

01:24:55.556 --> 01:24:59.691
And, uh... I didn't.

01:24:59.693 --> 01:25:00.491
Oh.

01:25:00.493 --> 01:25:05.462
She didn't want to miss out on
anything, especially motherhood.

01:25:05.464 --> 01:25:07.630
It got to be
a real problem with us.

01:25:07.632 --> 01:25:14.436
I thought she had plenty of time.
She didn't.

01:25:14.438 --> 01:25:19.908
Anyway, that's why I was grateful
when she met your father.

01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:23.344
He had the sense to love her
the way she deserved.

01:25:23.346 --> 01:25:28.182
Most of all,
I was glad that she had you,

01:25:28.184 --> 01:25:31.084
the baby she always wanted.

01:25:31.086 --> 01:25:34.620
I want you to know that.

01:25:40.661 --> 01:25:44.229
I'm gonna use the movies
when I give my report.

01:25:44.231 --> 01:25:46.064
Jeffrey says audiences
love special effects.

01:25:46.066 --> 01:25:49.867
You better ace it. You
sacrificed your whole vacation.

01:25:49.869 --> 01:25:55.939
It's a wonderful story
with a very happy ending.

01:25:59.311 --> 01:26:03.246
Sorry, doc. We closed
for business at 3:00 today.

01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:05.815
This isn't business.

01:26:05.817 --> 01:26:11.287
I found this wonderful Hungarian
restaurant that makes its own strudel.

01:26:11.289 --> 01:26:15.124
I thought you might like
a taste of the old country.

01:26:15.126 --> 01:26:20.863
There's apple and cherry,
and this is cheese.

01:26:20.865 --> 01:26:23.832
But I gotta say I think
the cherry is really...

01:26:23.834 --> 01:26:27.936
Okay, that does it.
The strudel does it.

01:26:27.938 --> 01:26:28.870
First it's the brakes.

01:26:28.872 --> 01:26:33.608
I'm not going to let some podiatrist with
a Jaguar full of strudel come and...

01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:37.144
I'm not a podiatrist.
I'm a cardiologist.

01:26:37.146 --> 01:26:41.615
Who cares? Rose, tell him
we have an arrangement.

01:26:41.617 --> 01:26:46.319
What kind of arrangement? -Yes,
what kind of arrangement?

01:26:46.321 --> 01:26:50.122
I'd be interested to know what
kind of arrangement we have.

01:26:50.124 --> 01:26:55.360
You know exactly
what kind it is.

01:26:55.362 --> 01:26:58.963
Come on, rose,
what do you want from me?

01:26:58.965 --> 01:27:01.699
I don't want anything
you don't want to give me.

01:27:01.701 --> 01:27:04.101
You certainly shouldn't settle
for less than you deserve.

01:27:04.103 --> 01:27:08.305
Stay out of this! If I had a
red xk150 with black interior,

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:10.740
I wouldn't be handing out
relationship advice.

01:27:10.742 --> 01:27:11.774
I don't think the color
of the interior...

01:27:11.776 --> 01:27:17.646
- rose, this is not the place to be having...
- This place is just fine.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.319
You know how I feel about you.

01:27:25.321 --> 01:27:30.424
You like the way I cook?
I make out a great invoice?

01:27:30.426 --> 01:27:36.229
You and Nick and this garage
are my whole life.

01:27:36.231 --> 01:27:39.332
I love you.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.967
Sure, you don't have
the greatest taste in music,

01:27:41.969 --> 01:27:47.405
but there's not another woman who
could look so sexy in that smock.

01:27:47.407 --> 01:27:50.641
What I'm try...
what I'm trying...

01:27:54.446 --> 01:27:56.712
what I mean to say...

01:27:56.714 --> 01:27:59.214
rose, will you marry me?

01:27:59.216 --> 01:28:03.117
You really think I look sexy
in a smock?

01:28:03.119 --> 01:28:05.986
Is that a "yes"?

01:28:20.234 --> 01:28:22.400
Thanks for everything.
You're the best.

01:28:22.402 --> 01:28:26.604
No, you're the best. I don't want you
talking to anybody on the plane.

01:28:26.606 --> 01:28:28.405
Dad already gave me
this lecture.

01:28:28.407 --> 01:28:30.273
He's gonna meet me at the
airport.

01:28:30.275 --> 01:28:33.509
We'll go for pizza and have
dinner in bed with Shelly.

01:28:33.511 --> 01:28:37.579
Sounds great. Give 'em
both one of these for me.

01:28:40.517 --> 01:28:42.016
Bye, aunt rose.

01:28:42.018 --> 01:28:44.385
Bye, niece vada.

01:28:46.455 --> 01:28:48.688
Thanks.

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:51.524
Well, bye.

01:29:02.169 --> 01:29:05.703
Um, listen, I'm sorry

01:29:05.705 --> 01:29:08.105
you had to sacrifice
your entire vacation.

01:29:08.107 --> 01:29:11.475
Some sacrifices are worth it.

01:29:11.477 --> 01:29:15.045
You mean,
it wasn't that terrible?

01:29:15.047 --> 01:29:18.748
I wouldn't say it was terrible.

01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:20.983
It was kind of...

01:29:20.985 --> 01:29:23.051
an adventure?

01:29:23.053 --> 01:29:27.288
Part adventure...

01:29:28.791 --> 01:29:31.258
Part miracle.

01:30:02.724 --> 01:30:04.790
Write me a poem?

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:11.129
No? I'll write you ten poems.

01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:17.968
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your final boarding call.

01:30:17.970 --> 01:30:20.303
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

01:30:20.305 --> 01:30:22.672
Look in your backpack.

01:30:24.509 --> 01:30:27.343
Okay.

01:30:50.668 --> 01:30:56.271
<i>¶ It's been building
up inside of me</i>

01:30:56.273 --> 01:31:00.108
<i>¶ for, oh, I don't know</i>
<i>how long</i>

01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:04.712
<i>¶ I don't know why</i>
<i>but I keep thinking</i>

01:31:04.714 --> 01:31:08.716
<i>¶ something's bound to go wrong</i>

01:31:08.718 --> 01:31:12.920
<i>¶ but she looks in my eyes</i>

01:31:12.922 --> 01:31:14.521
<i>¶ and makes me realize</i>

01:31:14.523 --> 01:31:19.025
<i>¶ and she says</i>
<i>don't worry, baby ¶</i>

01:31:23.865 --> 01:31:30.703
<i>¶ Don't worry, baby</i>
<i>don't worry, baby ¶</i>

01:31:30.705 --> 01:31:33.238
life is full of
barbaric customs.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.342
I just hope they all end
with a kiss like that.

01:31:54.928 --> 01:31:59.463
Arthur, where's my dad? -He
took Shelly to the hospital.

01:31:59.465 --> 01:32:04.234
Is she okay? -She was
making a lot of noise.

01:32:22.354 --> 01:32:24.687
Dad!

01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:29.558
What happened to Shelly? -She
just had a baby, that's all.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:33.562
We have a baby? -Mm-hmm. A boy.
You've got a new brother.

01:32:33.564 --> 01:32:38.066
Can I see him? -Do anything you want.
You're his sister.

01:32:38.068 --> 01:32:40.868
Hey, what's on your ear?

01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:46.006
- Shelly?
- Hey!

01:32:49.978 --> 01:32:52.311
Mmm, look.

01:32:52.313 --> 01:32:53.679
He's so tiny.

01:32:53.681 --> 01:32:56.515
I know.
Look at his little hands.

01:32:56.517 --> 01:33:01.686
- Sorry I couldn't pick you up.
- I was pushing

01:33:01.688 --> 01:33:03.587
did it hurt a lot?

01:33:03.589 --> 01:33:07.057
You have no idea.

01:33:07.059 --> 01:33:10.927
Shh.

01:33:12.397 --> 01:33:15.431
Let me hold him. Okay.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.868
Got his head? Yeah.

01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:23.671
- You like that.
- Yes.

01:33:28.411 --> 01:33:30.310
Maybe he's wet.

01:33:30.312 --> 01:33:32.445
Maybe he's hungry.

01:33:32.447 --> 01:33:36.549
He's okay.
You just have to sing to him.

01:33:36.551 --> 01:33:42.821
<i>¶ Smile though your heart</i>
<i>is aching</i>

01:33:42.823 --> 01:33:48.059
<i>¶ smile even though</i>
<i>it's breaking</i>

01:33:48.061 --> 01:33:50.394
<i>¶ although a tear</i>

01:33:50.396 --> 01:33:54.231

<i>¶ if you'll just smile ¶</i>

01:34:21.223 --> 01:34:24.857
Thing's haven't exactly
calmed down around here.

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:26.291
I got an a+ on the report.

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:30.562
Dad's getting used to my pierced
ears, and Nick's coming to visit.

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:34.399
Other than that,
I'm busy being a big sister.

01:34:34.401 --> 01:34:36.834
I like to tell my brother
about my mom,

01:34:36.836 --> 01:34:40.037
how I got to meet her friends and
find out how special she was.

01:34:40.039 --> 01:34:43.040
I mean, she may not have
her footprints in cement,

01:34:43.042 --> 01:34:45.475
but she definitely left
her imprint on the world.

01:34:45.477 --> 01:34:48.911
I told him that even though
it sounds conceited,

01:34:48.913 --> 01:34:51.146
her greatest achievement
was me.

01:34:51.148 --> 01:34:51.648
<i>¶</i>
