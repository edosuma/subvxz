00:09.472 --> 00:14.342
<i> It is midnight</i>
<i> and Gotham City sleeps.</i>

00:14.344 --> 00:15.376
<i> But not everyone..</i>

00:15.378 --> 00:21.849
<i> ...for there is evil afoot in</i>
<i> the Gotham City art museum.</i>

00:26.320 --> 00:28.454
What's that?

00:28.456 --> 00:29.555
Who's there?

01:10.492 --> 01:11.358
I know it was valuable.

01:11.360 --> 01:14.694
But why would they take
only that and leave all those

01:14.696 --> 01:15.628
other magnificent treasures?

01:15.630 --> 01:18.430
I'm as puzzled as you are,
commissioner.

01:18.432 --> 01:20.031
Uh, oh, Bonnie,
come in, come in.

01:20.033 --> 01:22.733
Oddest looking man
left this for you, sir,

01:22.735 --> 01:24.000
He said, it was important.

01:24.002 --> 01:25.501
Odd looking?
In what way, Bonnie?

01:25.503 --> 01:30.038
I'm just not sure, commissioner,
he was as jumpy as a cat.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.473
Thank you,
thank you, Bonnie.

01:34.843 --> 01:36.076
A kitten.

01:36.078 --> 01:38.978
Look, there's a bit of
paper under it's collar.

01:38.980 --> 01:43.749
Yes, newspaper clipping,
what do you make of it O'Hara?

01:43.751 --> 01:44.382
What?

01:44.584 --> 01:47.785
Wait, that's Mark Andrews,
the multi-millionaire.

01:47.787 --> 01:49.620
'Owner of the stolen,
golden cat.'

01:49.622 --> 01:52.823
And look, one of
them has been crossed out.

01:52.825 --> 01:55.325
And those two cats
are only a small part

01:55.327 --> 01:56.259
of his priceless collection.

01:56.461 --> 01:58.861
Yes, now one was
on loan to the museum

01:58.863 --> 02:02.531
and the other is at
the Gotham City Exposition.

02:02.533 --> 02:06.468
I smell the tracks
of a feline predator.

02:06.470 --> 02:08.937
- You mean?
- Exactly.

02:08.939 --> 02:09.836
The Catwoman.

02:09.839 --> 02:13.307
I'm afraid this calls
for more drastic methods.

02:21.582 --> 02:24.216
It's actually,
quite rudimentary, Dick.

02:24.218 --> 02:28.320
You just have to think,
14 moves ahead that's all.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.322
Holy rachetskey!

02:30.324 --> 02:30.989
Gosh, Bruce.

02:30.991 --> 02:34.826
I think I'll just stick
to Latin crossword puzzles.

02:40.833 --> 02:42.166
Ahem.

02:42.168 --> 02:43.400
Yes, Alfred.

02:43.402 --> 02:46.436
The phone, sir.

02:46.438 --> 02:49.572
Well, I didn't
hear the phone.

02:49.574 --> 02:50.639
Oh, I..

02:50.641 --> 02:52.374
...I was just
making a call, madam.

02:52.876 --> 02:55.877
Well, and there was someone
on the line for Mr. Wayne.

02:55.879 --> 02:58.079
Oh, yes, that's
happened to me too.

02:58.381 --> 03:01.682
We'll finish our
snack later, Aunt Harriet.

03:07.522 --> 03:08.355
Yes, commissioner.

03:08.357 --> 03:11.658
'Dreadful news, Catwoman
is on the prowl again.'

03:11.660 --> 03:13.192
We're on our way.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.561
To the bat-poles.

03:33.078 --> 03:34.945

And we believe this is just the
first of the planned robbery.

04:45.407 --> 04:46.572
Good thinking,
commissioner.

04:46.574 --> 04:49.741
Obviously, the Catwoman would
not be satisfied with only this.

04:49.743 --> 04:52.210
No, I'm certain this
only the first stitch

04:52.212 --> 04:54.378
in the large
tapestry of crime.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.246
And the
clipping?

04:56.248 --> 04:57.814
There's a great deal
of hidden significance

04:57.816 --> 05:03.452
in the fact that just one
of the cats is scratched out.

05:03.454 --> 05:05.287
Gosh, I wish
Mark Andrews, was here.

05:05.289 --> 05:07.589
I bet he could give
us some more info.

05:07.591 --> 05:08.756
'And indeed I can.'

05:08.758 --> 05:11.458
'Batman, we know that you would
want Mr. Mark Andrews.'

05:11.460 --> 05:13.593
'We called him to come
down to the headquarters.'

05:13.595 --> 05:17.129
- How do you do, Mr. Andrews?
- What a thrill this is, Batman.

05:17.131 --> 05:19.364
I've followed your
exploits for years.

05:19.366 --> 05:20.431
Nice meeting you too, Robin.

05:20.433 --> 05:23.267
This clipping indicates that
there are two golden cats.

05:23.269 --> 05:26.370
Yes, the second one is
at the Gotham City Exposition.

05:26.372 --> 05:29.606
I wouldn't lend
any one institution

05:29.608 --> 05:31.074
both cats at one time.

05:31.076 --> 05:32.141
Insurance, you know?

05:32.143 --> 05:32.841
Yes, I understand.

05:32.843 --> 05:35.510
How long will it be
at the Exposition?

05:35.512 --> 05:36.377
Until this evening.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.479
If Catwoman is going
to steal that one.

05:38.481 --> 05:40.681
- She'll do it tonight.
- Correct, Robin.

05:40.683 --> 05:41.748
There's no
time to lose.

05:41.750 --> 05:45.384
Will you wanting any
extra police protection?

05:45.386 --> 05:46.385
No, thank you, Chief O'Hara.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.854
I certainly don't mean
to cast any aspersions

05:48.856 --> 05:50.589
on the police department.

05:50.591 --> 05:51.456
'This time I think.'

05:51.458 --> 05:53.724
Robin and I better
go at it alone.

05:53.726 --> 05:56.259
Any large contingent
of police officers

05:56.261 --> 05:59.161
might create
unnecessary confusion.

05:59.163 --> 06:00.295
Whatever you say, Batman.

06:00.297 --> 06:03.498
I know it'll be safe
with you on the job.

06:03.666 --> 06:05.099
Let's go, Robin.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.002
It just doesn't sound right.

06:10.004 --> 06:11.236
Too easy is it, Robin?

06:11.238 --> 06:13.171
First, the cat at the museum..

06:13.173 --> 06:15.806
...then the cat
at the Exposition.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.174
Then...then..

06:17.176 --> 06:19.409
The rest of
Mark Andrew's collection.

06:19.411 --> 06:21.077
Holy trickery,
you're right.

06:21.079 --> 06:21.911
But I don't understand

06:21.913 --> 06:24.380
why Catwoman wouldn't
tell us what she's planning.

06:24.382 --> 06:29.952
Maybe to give us a false
lead to hide the real crime.

06:31.354 --> 06:33.954
Robin, you haven't fastened
your safety bat-belt.

06:33.956 --> 06:36.323
We're only going
a couple of blocks.

06:36.325 --> 06:38.491
It won't be long until
you're old enough

06:38.493 --> 06:40.259
to get
a driver's license, Robin.

06:40.261 --> 06:45.430
Then you'll be able to drive the
Batmobile and other vehicles.

06:45.432 --> 06:47.365
Remember, motorist's safety.

06:47.367 --> 06:50.434
Gosh, Batman when
you put it that way.

06:52.103 --> 06:54.270
<i> Meanwhile, in a quiet alley </i>

06:54.272 --> 06:57.439
<i> in the heart of</i>
<i> downtown, Gotham City</i>

06:57.441 --> 06:59.340
<i> is a fur warehouse</i>

06:59.342 --> 07:02.009
<i> an innocent place of business..</i>

07:02.011 --> 07:04.144
...<i> or is it?</i>

07:06.514 --> 07:10.383
What a beauty, I bet it's
worth a small fortune.

07:10.385 --> 07:12.251
A fat lot of good that does is.

07:12.253 --> 07:14.920
She stole it but
she won't sell it.

07:14.922 --> 07:16.288
Yeah, I wonder why.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.356
We should get our cut.

07:23.061 --> 07:25.462
Yours is not to reason why.

07:25.464 --> 07:27.597
Yours is to do as I tell you to.

07:27.599 --> 07:31.968
Or you'll keep tasting
my cat o' nine tails.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.374
Leo, did you get the books?

07:38.376 --> 07:39.241
'Yes, Catwoman.'

07:39.243 --> 07:42.944
I had to go all the way
down to the main library.

07:42.946 --> 07:44.946
But I got every one of them.

07:44.948 --> 07:46.647
Felix, what about the delivery?

07:46.649 --> 07:49.616
Smooth as cream,
made it without a hitch.

07:49.618 --> 07:50.216
'Good.'

07:50.218 --> 07:53.953
I know that Batman and Robin
will swallow the bait.

07:53.955 --> 07:54.586
And when they do..

07:54.588 --> 07:58.456
...I'll be rid of that
dynamic duo once and for all.

07:58.458 --> 08:01.158
Others have
tried but failed.

08:01.359 --> 08:03.259
The Catwoman is not
like the others.

08:03.261 --> 08:06.895
I'll show you how to clip
Batman and Robin's wings.

08:06.897 --> 08:08.363
I will prevail.

08:08.365 --> 08:11.065
Oh, joy success and revenge.

08:11.067 --> 08:13.667
All wrapped up into
one sweet package.

08:13.669 --> 08:17.570
We're sorry, Catwoman, we didn't
mean to step on your paws.

08:17.572 --> 08:20.306
Hmm...don't do it again.

08:20.308 --> 08:24.310
- Now where are the books?
- I'll get them for you.

08:27.180 --> 08:30.382
Each of you know what
you have to do, so do it.

08:30.384 --> 08:33.918
And remember this,
once we get that other cat

08:33.919 --> 08:36.419
the key to untold riches
will be ours.

08:36.422 --> 08:38.020
Yes, Catwoman.

09:15.323 --> 09:16.723
Good afternoon, sir.

09:16.725 --> 09:17.323
Trouble?

09:17.325 --> 09:20.693
The Catwoman has
unsheathed her claws again.

09:20.695 --> 09:21.593
Oh, tsk itch.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.594
Will she never learn?

09:22.596 --> 09:25.029
Well the atomic reactor
is recharging the Batmobile.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.364
Please help Robin with
the auxiliary power channel.

09:27.366 --> 09:30.367
- Time is of the essence.
- Yes, sir.

09:39.676 --> 09:42.411
All set on
the auxiliary power channel.

09:42.413 --> 09:43.512
Good.

09:43.514 --> 09:45.547
Solution is ready.

09:45.549 --> 09:49.785
Increase the power to 17,000KW.

10:12.807 --> 10:15.475
Power is 17,000 KW.

10:15.477 --> 10:16.342
That's it.

10:16.344 --> 10:19.211
- All power off.
- All power off.

10:19.213 --> 10:20.245
- Alfred.
- Yes, sir.

10:20.247 --> 10:24.382
Please attach that high-pressure
can to the outlet valve.

10:40.165 --> 10:40.597
There.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.665
That will neutralize
the dangerous radioactivity

10:42.667 --> 10:46.201
and give us the proper amount
of emission for our purposes.

10:46.203 --> 10:50.405
And may I enquire, sir,
exactly what are your purposes?

10:50.407 --> 10:51.272
Of course, Alfred.

10:51.274 --> 10:54.642
It's a defense mechanism in case
the Catwoman eludes us tonight

10:54.644 --> 10:57.344
and decides
to make off with the prize.

10:57.346 --> 11:00.246
You see, we spray this
radioactive mist on an object

11:00.248 --> 11:03.816
then we trace with the
Bat-o-meter with in a radius

11:03.818 --> 11:05.217
of 50 miles.

11:05.219 --> 11:06.585
Remarkable.

11:06.719 --> 11:09.454
When dealing with powerful
criminal elements

11:09.456 --> 11:13.157
one can never be
too well prepared.

11:13.159 --> 11:14.725
Let's go.

11:24.869 --> 11:28.504
Batman and Robin,
this way please.

11:28.506 --> 11:30.472
Thank you, citizens.

11:30.474 --> 11:34.476
No need for you to wait in line.
You're on official business.

11:34.478 --> 11:35.443
I'd rather not say.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.945
There's no charge for you.
Go right in.

11:37.947 --> 11:42.382
Well, I'd rather pay, just
like any other ordinary citizen.

11:54.128 --> 11:55.660
- Yes.
- 'They're here.'

11:55.662 --> 11:58.529
- Excellent.
- This place closes at six.

11:58.531 --> 12:03.100
One of the guys told me, they'll
be at the Great Hall of Culture

12:03.102 --> 12:07.237
- 'and all alone.'
- Splendid.

12:07.239 --> 12:10.173
'Is everything okay?'

12:10.974 --> 12:12.174
Purr-fect.

12:12.176 --> 12:14.976
Well, I for one,
just don't like it, that's all.

12:14.978 --> 12:18.312
I mean, dealing
with Batman and Robin.

12:18.314 --> 12:21.415
I don't know,
it just makes me nervous.

12:21.417 --> 12:22.549
Everything makes you nervous.

12:22.551 --> 12:26.386
Well, I'd feel a lot better
if I knew who he really was.

12:26.388 --> 12:30.390
The whole idea
of a bat bothers me.

12:30.392 --> 12:33.359
That's exactly
what I'd expect from you.

12:37.330 --> 12:38.063
5:30.

12:38.065 --> 12:40.365
Just enough time
for a cat-nap.

12:40.367 --> 12:41.699
Felix, scram.

12:41.701 --> 12:47.638
And have the car parked at the
corner at exactly 11, sharp.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.339
Right.

13:00.484 --> 13:01.183
There.

13:01.185 --> 13:03.818
Now we'll be able
to trace the radioactivity

13:03.820 --> 13:06.053
within a 50 mile radius.

13:08.790 --> 13:09.356
Almost midnight.

13:09.358 --> 13:12.292
- Time to check the exits again.
- I'll do it.

13:12.594 --> 13:15.461
No, Robin, you better
let me do it this time.

13:15.463 --> 13:19.465
If you see or hear anything, let
me know via bat-communicator.

13:19.467 --> 13:22.534
I'll be back
in 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.235
Right.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.797
Holy cats, a cat.

14:02.172 --> 14:04.706
Help, Batman, help.

14:06.308 --> 14:08.442
What is it, Robin, answer me.

14:08.444 --> 14:10.143
A-ah.

14:10.477 --> 14:11.477
Poor little Robin

14:11.479 --> 14:15.180
Did the itty-bitty kitty
ruffle your feathers?

14:20.519 --> 14:25.656
♪ Din-ding-ding din-ding-ding ♪

14:25.658 --> 14:27.357
You, feline devil.

14:27.359 --> 14:29.125
- What have you done with Robin?
- Oh.

14:29.127 --> 14:32.461
Is that anyway to greet
an old friend, Batman?

14:32.463 --> 14:35.397
Not even a
"Hello, how are you?".

14:37.299 --> 14:38.866
Meow.

14:38.868 --> 14:41.335
Teach him some manners, fellas.

15:15.470 --> 15:17.838
'Robin. Old chum.'

15:21.576 --> 15:24.811
Come on, cats, let's
get out of here.

15:33.453 --> 15:34.820
What happened?

15:34.822 --> 15:35.620
The cat.

15:35.622 --> 15:38.889
Easy now, Robin, you were
drugged with cat-o-cor.

15:38.891 --> 15:41.224
A fiendish preparation
designed to attack

15:41.226 --> 15:42.225
the central nervous system.

15:42.227 --> 15:46.195
Universal drug antidote pills
will fix you up post-haste.

15:46.197 --> 15:47.262
Did you get the cat?

15:47.264 --> 15:50.765
Yes, Robin, it's
just as I planned it.

15:50.767 --> 15:54.401
Now, the Catwoman will
herself lead us to her lair

15:54.403 --> 15:57.270
and the recovery of both cats.

16:01.774 --> 16:04.142
Batman, the Bat-o-meter
is functioning perfectly.

16:04.144 --> 16:08.679
All we do is follow
the blip and we're on the trail.

16:09.781 --> 16:11.782
Of course I know,
they're on our trail.

16:11.784 --> 16:15.051
They wouldn't be Batman
and Robin if they weren't.

16:15.053 --> 16:16.685
Are we set to greet
our two pigeons?

16:16.687 --> 16:19.220
They're going to get a "hello"
they'll never forget.

16:19.222 --> 16:22.957
Good, just make sure
nothing goes wrong.

16:22.959 --> 16:25.859
I wouldn't want
to miss this opportunity.

16:25.861 --> 16:30.163
'We're ready
whenever you are, Catwoman.'

16:30.165 --> 16:32.064
- Felix.
- Yes, Catwoman.

16:32.066 --> 16:35.834
You can brush my pussy willows
before you leave.

16:36.168 --> 16:37.968
'And don't go against the fur.'

16:37.970 --> 16:41.104
I'll treat them
like they was my very own.

17:24.314 --> 17:25.414
This is it, Robin.

17:25.415 --> 17:27.415
She's in that building.

17:29.452 --> 17:31.886
How can you be sure, Batman?

17:32.120 --> 17:35.322
Look up, Robin,
the sign on the door

17:35.324 --> 17:36.690
"Gato and Chat Fur Company."

17:36.692 --> 17:40.060
Gato means cat in Spanish
and Chat means cat in French.

17:40.062 --> 17:43.296
Only the Catwoman'd choose
a hideout with those names.

17:43.298 --> 17:45.865
I'm glad you're upping
your foreign languages, Robin.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.299
They come in handy
when fighting crime.

17:47.301 --> 17:49.167
<i> Si, si,</i> Batman,
what do we do now?

17:49.169 --> 17:52.770
There are no entrances and only
one door, we have no choice.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.705
We'll use the Bat-beam
and the Batmobile.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.139
Why don't we
walk right in?

17:56.141 --> 17:57.373
That's the door,
maybe booby-trap.

17:57.375 --> 18:01.377
We won't take any chances
if we use the Bat-beam.

18:04.548 --> 18:06.582
Stand by for Bat-beam.

18:16.891 --> 18:20.026
You're right again, Batman,
we might have been killed.

18:20.028 --> 18:22.862
Or worse. Now, let's go.

18:38.378 --> 18:39.845
The door.

18:39.847 --> 18:43.114
Seems, it would be more
difficult getting out of here

18:43.116 --> 18:44.415
than it was getting in.

18:44.417 --> 18:47.885
'Good evening,
Batman and Robin.'

18:47.887 --> 18:50.420
'Welcome.'

18:50.422 --> 18:51.521
Good evening, Catwoman.

18:51.523 --> 18:53.189
It seems as if you
were expecting us.

18:53.191 --> 18:56.492
'I have a wonderful
night planned for you'

18:56.494 --> 18:59.061
'and it starts right now.'

19:10.106 --> 19:10.872
Where are we?

19:10.874 --> 19:15.343
'You are deep in the inner
catacombs of this building.'

19:15.345 --> 19:20.314
'This is the last room
you will ever occupy.'

19:20.915 --> 19:23.917
I've heard
that song before, Catwoman.

19:23.919 --> 19:26.986
The last few bars
are always the same.

19:26.988 --> 19:30.356
The criminal is
always behind them.

19:30.358 --> 19:32.291
This is my night to howl,
Batman.

19:32.293 --> 19:36.495
Because tonight you are
the mice and I am the cat.

19:36.497 --> 19:38.430
The old cat and mouse game
is it?

19:38.432 --> 19:42.467
'You have a wonderful
way with words, Batman.'

19:42.469 --> 19:45.269
I couldn't have
put it any better.

19:45.271 --> 19:49.940
How does it feel to be
the quarry for a change, hmm?

19:51.175 --> 19:55.478
'What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?'

19:58.549 --> 20:02.484
'Alright, you've had
your laugh, Catwoman.'

20:02.486 --> 20:06.354
- Now what you intend to do is--
- 'Do?'

20:06.356 --> 20:06.987
Well..

20:06.989 --> 20:11.024
First, I'm gonna give you,
two a few pointers.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.394
Holy icepicks!

20:19.365 --> 20:20.298
What're we gonna do, Batman?

20:20.300 --> 20:23.501
'Ticklish situation.
Isn't it Batman?'

20:23.503 --> 20:27.304
Hit the deck, Robin,
I'll get us out of this.

20:49.427 --> 20:54.030
These pointers are made
of painted rubber, Robin.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.635
- The old cat and mouse game.
- Exactly.

20:59.637 --> 21:04.506
'But, it was scary
for a while, wasn't it, Batman?'

21:04.508 --> 21:05.106
'Meow.'

21:05.108 --> 21:09.143
Your sense of humor
leaves me cold, Catwoman.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.613
Felix.

21:20.020 --> 21:24.089
Perhaps, my next idea
will warm you up, Batman.

21:24.091 --> 21:25.990
It's quite interesting.

21:25.992 --> 21:28.392
Almost, "cat-aclysmic".

21:28.394 --> 21:30.527
Evil is as evil does.

21:53.050 --> 21:58.586
'Now you have to admit
that was funny, Batman.'

21:59.321 --> 22:02.056
Your childish antics
lead me to believe

22:02.058 --> 22:05.692
you're... a kitten not a cat.

22:06.694 --> 22:08.695
'Leo'

22:13.600 --> 22:15.100
I'm bored with you, Batman.

22:15.102 --> 22:17.969
The time has come
to separate Damon from Pythias.

22:17.971 --> 22:22.707
The cat-alogue is closed.
Say goodbye to each other.

22:31.016 --> 22:35.085
'Bye-bye, Robin.
Your little bird has flown.'

22:35.087 --> 22:36.152
What have you done with him?

22:36.154 --> 22:40.657
'That's for me to know
and you to find out.'

22:41.525 --> 22:43.092
You, feline devil.

22:43.094 --> 22:45.527
Tsk tsk and
another tsk, Batman.

22:45.529 --> 22:48.596
Why don't you just admit
I'm smarter than you are

22:48.598 --> 22:49.496
and let it go at that?

22:49.498 --> 22:53.000
There's more than one way
to skin a catwoman.

22:53.002 --> 22:55.702
'Are you a betting man?'

22:55.704 --> 22:57.570
I never gamble.

22:57.572 --> 22:59.071
Well, this time you'll have to

22:59.073 --> 23:02.641
because I now have
a wager you must accept.

23:02.643 --> 23:04.009
The stake's are your life.

23:04.011 --> 23:07.012
- You leave me no choice.
- 'Ah, but I do.'

23:07.014 --> 23:11.883
'And that is the
sum and substance of the bet.

23:11.885 --> 23:14.285
'In front of you are two doors.'

23:14.287 --> 23:17.288
'I'm standing
behind one of them.'

23:17.290 --> 23:19.923
- And the other?
- 'Ah, there's the rub.'

23:19.925 --> 23:24.761
'Behind the other door is a
ferocious Batman eating tiger.'

23:24.763 --> 23:27.230
- So, the odds are even.
- 'Correct.'

23:27.232 --> 23:29.932
'If you pick the right door'

23:29.934 --> 23:32.067
'I'm yours, Batman.'

23:32.069 --> 23:34.702
'If you pick the wrong door'

23:34.704 --> 23:36.837
'you're mine.'

23:36.839 --> 23:39.272
'So, which is it, Batman'

23:39.274 --> 23:40.873
'the lady'

23:40.875 --> 23:43.208
'or the tiger?'

23:46.045 --> 23:48.780
'The lady or the tiger?'

23:56.754 --> 24:00.957
<i> Will Batman ever see</i>
<i> Robin alive again?</i>

24:01.458 --> 24:05.527
<i> Will Robin ever see</i>
<i> Batman alive again?</i>

24:08.631 --> 24:12.000
<i> Will our daring duo</i>
<i> escape the claws</i>

24:12.002 --> 24:13.868
<i> of the wily Catwoman?</i>

24:15.504 --> 24:19.572
<i> The answer to these and many</i>
<i> other terrifying questions</i>

24:19.574 --> 24:27.046
<i> tomorrow night, same cat time</i>
