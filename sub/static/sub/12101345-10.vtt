WEBVTT

00:57.891 --> 01:00.643
-The Empire is not your enemy.
-

01:01.644 --> 01:07.233
We promise to treat all planets within the
Confederacy of Independent Systems fairly.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.196
All we asked in exchange was
for your loyalty.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.741
Yet that has not been forthcoming
here on Raxus.

01:14.824 --> 01:17.452
I can't go through with this.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.954
Senator, it is your only option.

01:20.455 --> 01:24.417
This is what it's come to?
I must be a puppet for the Empire?

01:24.501 --> 01:26.127
If you do not comply,

01:26.211 --> 01:28.672
you will be arrested
like the other senators. Or worse.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.548
To deal with the rise in incursions,

01:30.632 --> 01:35.345
a mandatory curfew will be put
into effect for your protection.

01:35.970 --> 01:40.809
Such measures were approved
by your esteemed senator, Avi Singh,

01:40.892 --> 01:46.106
who would like to say a few words
about the importance of cooperation

01:46.189 --> 01:49.401
as we build a unified galaxy.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.278
Senator?

01:52.862 --> 01:57.242
GS-8, if anything happens to me,
follow my instructions to the letter.

01:57.325 --> 02:00.537
What will happen, Senator? Senator?

02:09.045 --> 02:14.843
Fellow citizens,
I implore you to embrace these new laws.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.722
Under the Empire,
Raxus will flourish once more.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.766
And as your senator, I promise--

02:22.767 --> 02:24.436
I…

02:24.519 --> 02:26.104
I promise to…

02:29.315 --> 02:30.316
No.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.235
This is wrong.

02:33.820 --> 02:38.950
It is my duty to act
in your best interest,

02:39.034 --> 02:45.248
and it is why I can no longer condone
this unjust occupation.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.254
They wish to intimidate us, to scare us,

02:52.088 --> 02:56.384
but we shall not cower
at their acts of aggression.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.931
-Move in.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.267
Step aside. Clear out!

03:04.351 --> 03:06.353
We have every right to be here.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.146
You're the ones trespassing.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.316
-

03:44.557 --> 03:49.020
I'm sending this message on behalf
of my master, Senator Avi Singh of Raxus.

03:49.521 --> 03:53.400
The senator has been seized by Imperial
authorities and is in grave danger.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.652
We require your assistance.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.546
How's the Mantell Mix, kid?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.089
Mm-hmm.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.882
Better than ever.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.638
So, when's our next mission?

04:24.139 --> 04:28.393
With two bounty hunters after you,
it'd be wise to keep a low profile.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.686
Tech's right.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.148
There's too much heat on us right now.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.026
Ha! That never stopped us before.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.696
The kid's been through enough.
She needs a break.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.492
She seems fine to me.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.630
I've got a mission for you boys.

04:58.214 --> 05:02.427
-A simple extraction on Raxus.
-Raxus?

05:02.510 --> 05:05.430
That is the former center
of the Separatist government.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.098
It has since become an Imperial outpost--

05:07.182 --> 05:10.602
I'm not interested
in a history lesson, Goggles.

05:10.685 --> 05:16.274
You're being hired to locate and free
Senator Avi Singh from his confinement.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.819
My client will meet you
at the given coordinates to brief you.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.447
Details are on this. Now get going.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.075
Help a Separatist?

05:26.659 --> 05:28.078
Not gonna happen.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.832
Your debt's still not paid, remember?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.292
A job's a job.

05:38.880 --> 05:43.176
I am not bringing Omega
to a planet swarming with Imperials.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.931
So leave her here with me.
I'll keep an eye on her.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.059
I don't exactly trust you either.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.520
Good. You shouldn't.

05:53.603 --> 05:57.649
But if keeping the kid safe
means more money in my pocket,

05:57.732 --> 06:00.694
it's in my best interest
to do so, isn't it?

06:01.403 --> 06:04.489
-If anything happens to her--
- Yeah, yeah, Bandana.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.825
Just get outta here, will you?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.665
Ready when you are, Sergeant.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.377
Not this time, Omega.
You're staying with Cid.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.548
But th-the mission.
I'm part of the squad too.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.926
Then following orders
shouldn't be a problem.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.471
Stay close to Cid
and don't leave this parlor.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.306
Got it, soldier?

06:32.267 --> 06:33.268
Yes, sir.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.902
Hey, tiny, I got a mission for you.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.864
Now get scrubbing.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.248
We've never been to Raxus before.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.125
The coordinates from Cid have us landing

06:57.208 --> 07:00.795
outside the capital city of Raxulon,
the home of their Senate.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.798
I can't believe we're helping
a Separatist senator.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.218
So you have said. Repeatedly.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.263
I always thought we'd make it
to Raxus someday.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.140
But not like this.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.658
Unidentified transport,
this is restricted airspace.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.160
Transmit your clearance code.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.162
Input the codes from Cid's client.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.086
Hunter, the client is a Separatist.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.421
How do we know this isn't a trap?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.636
You're cleared for entry. Proceed.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.722
Now are you convinced?

07:53.348 --> 07:54.599
No.

08:15.912 --> 08:19.207
I am simply stating
that the codes did, in fact, work.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.502
The client being
a Separatist is not relevant.

08:22.585 --> 08:23.628
It is to me.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.548
Forget politics. We're here to do a job.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.717
I am very pleased to hear you say that.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.052
Who are you?

08:31.136 --> 08:32.387
I am your client.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.222
We're working for a droid?

08:34.305 --> 08:35.598
That is correct.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.435
My master, Senator Singh,
was arrested for speaking out

08:38.518 --> 08:41.396
-against the unjust occupation--
- We don't care.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.065
Just take us
to where the senator's being held.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.609
Right to it. I like you.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.029
Very well. Follow me.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.380
Enough with the moping around.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.716
You're bringing the mood down around here.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.135
Sorry.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.847
All right, I'll bite.
What's wrong with you?

09:17.223 --> 09:21.311
I haven't heard back from them yet.
Do you think they're okay?

09:21.394 --> 09:24.022
They better be for what this job's paying.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.275
I should've gone with them on the mission.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.526
It's not fair.

09:28.610 --> 09:32.822
I've got news for you, kid.
Life ain't fair.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.032
You don't like it?

09:34.115 --> 09:36.701
Stop pouting and do something about it.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.704
Maybe if you weren't so helpless,

09:39.788 --> 09:43.625
those four laser brains wouldn't
have left you here with me.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.469
What are you two looking at?

09:58.223 --> 10:00.141
I'm not helpless.

10:02.602 --> 10:09.442
Look, kid, I told dark and broody
I'd keep an eye on you and keep you safe.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.611
Hmm. For how much?

10:13.029 --> 10:15.407
Not enough.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.016
We have reached our destination.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.854
There are six exterior guards
and multiple heat signatures inside.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.189
Four in the subterranean level.

10:48.273 --> 10:51.109
Why do I get the feeling
you're setting us up?

10:51.192 --> 10:54.404
It is against my programming
to send my allies into danger.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.240
We ain't allies, tin bin.
- Enough.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.285
We need to take out
the compound's surveillance system.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.786
Move in.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.437
Time to make yourself useful.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.482
I do not possess a military
skill set for a tactical advantage.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.150
We're counting on it.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.071
You! This is a restricted area!

11:36.654 --> 11:38.073
To whom are you addressing?

11:38.156 --> 11:40.158
This is my master's residence.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.535
I suggest you leave before--

11:42.619 --> 11:43.661
Oh, dear.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.248
Stop! Stop!

11:47.874 --> 11:50.502
-

12:33.628 --> 12:35.630
I am tapped into their security system.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.799
You two, clear the upper levels.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.677
Tech, we'll take the main floor and below.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.554
Droid, you're sticking with me.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.986
There's two at the door.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.488
I'm clocking four
in the adjacent corridor.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.825
I'll handle them.
You and Omega loop back around.

13:04.784 --> 13:09.456
That would be impossible,
seeing as Omega is not on this mission.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.167
-[Hunter] Ah, right.
-[GS-8] Not to worry.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.210
-I am getting the hang of this.
- No, wait!

13:14.294 --> 13:17.464
Excuse me, guards. I appear to be lost.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.924
Can you direct me to the nearest egress?

13:39.903 --> 13:41.321
Do be careful.

13:41.404 --> 13:45.075
This antique vase was gifted
to Senator Singh for his years of service.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.076
It is priceless.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.703
Droids.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.338
You've got her cornered!

13:58.421 --> 14:00.965
Oh, yeah, I'm real scared.

14:01.549 --> 14:05.136
Delay all you want,
you're not getting out of this one.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.472
I wouldn't do that.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.102
Hear that? We got an expert here.

14:17.607 --> 14:21.528
- She's done for!

14:22.987 --> 14:24.364
I told you.

14:25.198 --> 14:29.577
Well, expert, what should I do next?

14:34.708 --> 14:38.753
- You blew it!

14:40.964 --> 14:43.675
Yeah, but you're the one
who said to bet it all!

14:43.758 --> 14:45.844
You wanna take this outside?

14:45.927 --> 14:47.095
Gladly!

14:49.055 --> 14:50.807
How'd you know to do that?

14:51.391 --> 14:54.269
It's a strategy game.
I'm good at strategy.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.521
Hmm.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.064
How good?

14:58.148 --> 15:02.569
Enough to, uh, win a few matches
for some money?

15:02.652 --> 15:04.487
Depends.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.199
What's my cut?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.326
Hmm.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.453
Thirty percent.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.122
Sixty.

15:29.137 --> 15:33.224
Defying Imperial law
and openly inciting civil discord.

15:33.308 --> 15:36.102
I thought we had
an understanding, Senator.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.355
I refuse to be your puppet.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.358
My loyalty is to the people,
not the Empire.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.860
An unwise choice.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.947
Regardless, we will acquire
what we need from you.

15:48.031 --> 15:51.284
Your draconian tactics won't work on me,
Captain Bragg.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.703
That would be a first.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.841
-

16:12.806 --> 16:13.890
Senator!

16:13.973 --> 16:15.600
I followed your instructions
to the letter.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.771
I knew you'd come through, GS-8.

16:19.854 --> 16:23.483
And behold.
I have saved your most prized vase.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.902
Great. Now can we get out of here?

16:26.486 --> 16:27.570
With pleasure.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.115
- An alert has been triggered.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.790
-Our position has been compromised.
- Follow us.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.716
Come on!

16:51.302 --> 16:52.137
There.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.348
We'll seize that tank
and blow our way outta here.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.393
How do you intend to gain control
of the armored vehicle from up here?

16:58.476 --> 16:59.769
Coming through.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.120
All clear.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.872
Impressive.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.459
You can't possibly expect me to do that.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.212
-Just don't look down.
- Oh!

17:31.217 --> 17:32.677
Nicely done.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.637
Get this thing moving, Tech.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.148
They'll feel that in the morning.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.235
-They've commandeered one of the walkers.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.445
Pin them down.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.968
The rear axle stabilizer is off-line.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.262
We will need to recalibrate manually.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.974
Get this bucket up and running.
Wrecker and I will hold them off.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.998
No, you don't!

18:45.291 --> 18:46.835
-

18:49.254 --> 18:51.089
Wrecker.
- Oh!

18:54.884 --> 18:56.511
Oh, yeah!

19:19.576 --> 19:21.745
Tech, how we doing?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.246
I need more time.

19:23.747 --> 19:24.748
Freeze.

19:25.457 --> 19:26.624
Drop your weapons.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.338
You there.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.672
Senator!

19:35.675 --> 19:37.969
I never much cared for that vase.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.264
-Repairs complete.
- We're on our way.

19:54.819 --> 19:55.904
Turn down that alleyway.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.990
We'll be trapped in a choke point.

19:59.491 --> 20:01.451
You're going to have to trust me.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.879
They're moving into a dead end.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.890
Move into position next to that wall.
It leads to a subterranean passage.

20:32.107 --> 20:35.360
If you don't mind, please blast a hole
in the wall right here.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.861
That I can do.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.174
Hurry. This way.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.898
Captain, the walker's empty.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.328
What am I doing?

21:29.039 --> 21:31.332
I cannot abandon my people.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.585
I must help them.

21:33.668 --> 21:37.130
You will, Senator,
but not if you are in Imperial custody.

21:42.385 --> 21:45.388
She's right. Live to fight another day.

22:22.676 --> 22:25.136
-What's all this?

22:28.556 --> 22:31.017
-No one can stop this kid.
-

22:37.273 --> 22:38.692
Of course.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.757
Oh, she did it again!

23:11.558 --> 23:14.519
All right, show's over. No more bets.

23:15.103 --> 23:18.398
Kid, where'd you learn to do that?

23:18.898 --> 23:22.318
She's a natural.
I've never seen anything like it.

23:23.903 --> 23:28.491
I told you to keep a low profile.
This is the opposite.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.537
Ease up, Bandana.

23:32.620 --> 23:36.374
Omega made enough money
to pay off the debt you boys owe me,

23:36.458 --> 23:39.836
so try showing
a little gratitude to my friend.

23:40.754 --> 23:41.755
You did good.

23:42.756 --> 23:44.966
Senator, glad you made it.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.218
Let's talk payment.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.729
You really paid off our debt?

23:59.189 --> 24:03.485
I wanted to be useful,
even if I couldn't go on the mission.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.737
Hmm.

24:06.738 --> 24:10.367
How about we put
those strategy skills to the test?

24:11.201 --> 24:12.243
One match.

24:12.327 --> 24:16.498
If you win,
then no more sitting out on missions.

24:21.169 --> 24:22.504
You ready for this?

24:23.755 --> 24:25.006
Are you?
