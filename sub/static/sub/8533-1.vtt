02:18.096 --> 02:19.176
Oh, god.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.099
Oh, baby.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.229
Mary!

02:26.855 --> 02:28.685
<i>Mary!</i>

02:29.983 --> 02:32.193
Stay there!
Don't move!

02:43.372 --> 02:45.122
Diana, don't talk to me like that, okay?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.461
But I'm the only one who says no.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.635
- It's not fair!
- Okay, Diana, we're going to a museum.

03:01.390 --> 03:04.690
My little girl. Easy, champ.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.228
Daddy!

03:28.375 --> 03:31.285
<i>*</i> Mary!

04:11.251 --> 04:13.211
Di?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.723
Di?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.400
Diana!

04:37.944 --> 04:40.784
[ I gasps ] I giggles 1

04:42.574 --> 04:44.524
come on, you know better than that.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.408
Well, that's the problem.
You can't completely know someone.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.132
I didn't mean to scare you.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.872
Yes, you did.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.717
Not that bad anyway.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.724
The dream, I take it?

05:09.726 --> 05:11.646
The dream.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.274
I'm worried about you.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.534
Join the club.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.698
Maybe it's time to see somebody.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.779
Somebody will preach
what everybody preaches.

05:26.785 --> 05:30.245
Somebody will help you
to believe the truth, di.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.915
It wasn't your fault.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.587
I'll think about it, okay?

05:39.589 --> 05:44.089
Psych 101...
Play along to shut him up.

05:44.094 --> 05:48.014
I'm not playing along.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.854
But if you join me in there, I will.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.115
Late night last night?

06:08.910 --> 06:11.660
Hey, no, Katie! No, I need that.
Come on, it's not funny.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.870
Katie, come on.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.826
Catch me.

06:17.002 --> 06:21.702
Hey, quit it, okay? I'm center stage in...
Shit... 10 minutes.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.508
A t.A. Should be better prepared.
At.A. Doesn't give Greg t & a all night...

06:25.510 --> 06:27.390
When she should be studying.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.306
Ha.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.128
- Are you psychic?
- Your best friend... same thing.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.346
Yeah, well, I'm the one giving
the lecture, not you.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.324
So is Greg weirded out
'cause he's in your class?

06:38.982 --> 06:40.262
It's not a big deal.

06:40.358 --> 06:44.148
Not a big deal? Di, you have your choice
of grad schools next year.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.574
I guess so.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.066
You and Greg talked about next year yet?

06:48.700 --> 06:49.780
Have you and Billy?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.480
We don't need to.

06:51.578 --> 06:55.458
Billy does whatever I tell him to do.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.301
Hey, bimbos.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.420
- Where the hell were you last night?
- Research, baby. It was just research.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.087
Translation: Getting wasted.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.544
Hey, that hurts. Actually, I pulled an
all-nighter interviewing young horny chicks.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.169
- Ah, now that I believe.
- Do you have a death wish?

07:13.266 --> 07:15.976
Purely academic.
For my new psych paper.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.977
- On foot fetishes?
- No, new subject!

07:18.188 --> 07:21.398
Ready?
"Sex in public places: Ls it hotter?"

07:21.399 --> 07:24.279
- What do you think? No, you don't.
- I think I want a new boyfriend.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.572
You know, you should be careful.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.024
Hey! Speak of the devil.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.906
We were just talking about you.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.574
Only good things, I hope.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.448
Greg was just telling us how hard
you'd been working on the project.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.040
You know, Diana, you should be careful.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.093
Boys who don't get the attention
they need tend to look elsewhere for it.

07:48.093 --> 07:52.643
Oh, I'm not too worried.
When you're this good, they never wander.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.729
But through his experience of the
trojan war, achilles became a wise man,

08:02.732 --> 08:05.972
for he learned human suffering
and the larger scope of the heart.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.569
Your interpretation, Diana.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.566
<i>Uh, yes, I was...</i>

08:09.572 --> 08:11.872
Just getting to that, professor.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.833
My point is,
achilles was a tragic figure

08:17.122 --> 08:20.042
for he gained a deeper understanding
of the world through calamity.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.073
We all face our own personal trials
in life, and I think

08:24.170 --> 08:28.090
it's important to appreciate that often
through pain comes catharsis,

08:28.091 --> 08:30.081
and, in turn, spiritual growth.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.046
Thank you.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.874
Tomorrow,

08:34.972 --> 08:38.643
I want papers from all of you
on the pride of agamemnon

08:38.643 --> 08:41.553
and the role it played
in extending the trojan war.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.166
- You were great.
- Are you lying?

08:43.231 --> 08:45.011
Diana. I'll see you in the museum.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.738
Uh, 5330.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.492
Just blow him off.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.155
It's my job. I don't ask you to blow
off things you love.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.113
The only thing I love is you.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.746
Oh, nice try. Look, I'll be done by 8:00.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.751
Same line, different day.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.753
The museum is setting up
a new exhibit from Iran,

09:06.755 --> 09:08.415
and barash has weaseled the first look.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.207
He's letting me help for the first time.
I can't pass this up.

09:11.209 --> 09:14.669
I'm losing out to a geek boy professor.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.102
Relax, brown eyes.
You're in the lead.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.476
8:00 by the latest.
I promise.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.177
Professor?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.333
Hm.

12:09.771 --> 12:10.771
Hm.

12:33.544 --> 12:34.754
What?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.522
Shit.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.926
Hello?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.563
Who's there?

14:09.182 --> 14:10.432
Hello?

14:18.775 --> 14:21.275
Fear is a common indication
of guilt, you know?

14:22.236 --> 14:23.606
What are you guilty of, Diana?

14:24.280 --> 14:25.300
Only a breakthrough.

14:25.399 --> 14:26.609
Hey, that was addressed to me.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.701
I know, but you weren't here and...

14:30.787 --> 14:32.827
Look at the box.
It's just a shell.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.880
The real prize was inside.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.099
Wow!
That's magnificent.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.307
What is it?

14:53.142 --> 14:54.562
Well, we'll find out soon enough.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.055
What about the inscriptions?

14:57.855 --> 14:59.255
Translation papers are in the desk.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.980
Well, i... I speak fluent arabic.

15:02.819 --> 15:03.819
Really?

15:04.112 --> 15:05.612
Benefits of the classical education.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.539
So, simple casing.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.327
What do you see?

15:16.207 --> 15:17.377
Aramaic inscription.

15:18.251 --> 15:22.091
Okay, look again,
but this time, scrunch up your eyes.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.724
Fascinating.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.541
The eye of god.

15:29.637 --> 15:33.177
I pressed it, and open sesame.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.312
Well, I mean I'm sure you would've
figured that out in seconds.

15:35.409 --> 15:36.829
No, no.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.728
Don't... don't minimize
your accomplishments, Diana.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.856
You, you're my best student,

15:42.108 --> 15:45.988
and-and this, this is...
This is a remarkable discovery.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.454
Thank you.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.657
Well, you know what?
I think...

15:49.657 --> 15:52.697
I think this is a case for celebration.
Have you had dinner?

15:53.911 --> 15:58.541
- Actually, no, but...
- Excellent! I'll pop open a vintage chardonnay

15:58.541 --> 16:00.461
and we can decipher
these inscriptions.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.631
And maybe you can tell me
a little about yourself.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.874
Beyond academia, of course, like...

16:07.967 --> 16:12.847
We spend so much time together,
and the truth is,

16:12.847 --> 16:14.717
I hardly know you, Diana.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.440
- I'm sorry, professor, i...
- Oh, no.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.593
I have plans. I'm really sorry.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.688
- Oh, I see.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.572
Um, you know,
if I could change them, i...

16:29.197 --> 16:32.697
In any case, I don't think
my boyfriend would understand.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.661
I don't appreciate your insinuation, Diana.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.120
Oh, no, I didn't mean it like...

16:42.418 --> 16:43.878
I mean, um...

16:51.302 --> 16:52.432
Good night, professor.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.460
Ah!

17:26.628 --> 17:29.839
- Oh, Jesus.
- Not even close.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.010
Where is the one who woke me?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.000
<i>'</i> 'Hmm?

17:37.098 --> 17:41.058
Fear, my good man, is an instinct.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.730
Trust yours.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.399
I am real.

17:45.648 --> 17:49.688
Not a figment
of your guilty conscience.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.197
Where's my waker?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.409
If you are real,
i... I can't answer that.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.947
A learned man.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.406
One who knows of me.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.172
I am honored.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.588
I can help you.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.050
I don't need help.

18:14.969 --> 18:19.519
Come now, professor, you reek
of loneliness from your every pore.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.690
End your misery forever.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.609
Any woman,

18:26.814 --> 18:32.074
true perfect love for all eternity.

18:33.654 --> 18:37.024
Surely a man of your erudition

18:37.116 --> 18:40.746
can properly couch such a wish.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.044
Then you leave me no alternative.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.588
Please, professor.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.342
L... if we... don't!

18:54.884 --> 18:57.354
It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right.

18:58.304 --> 19:01.144
Please, don't! I... i...

19:01.349 --> 19:03.179
No! No!

19:17.406 --> 19:20.826
No, it wasn't like that.

19:21.369 --> 19:26.459
Will anyone believe you?
Refuse me again, and the world will know,

19:26.749 --> 19:28.129
my good professor.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.627
Thus, your world will end.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.721
Where is my waker?

19:36.217 --> 19:40.637
I... I don't... I don't...
I don't know exactly. I swear to you.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.808
- As you wish.
- Please!

19:43.808 --> 19:45.348
Just... just give me a chance.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.111
Wish, please.

19:55.486 --> 19:56.566
And if I do?

19:57.071 --> 20:03.791
Then your indiscretions
shall remain our secret.

20:07.415 --> 20:08.995
Iwish...

20:10.584 --> 20:11.844
For the most Beau...

20:13.254 --> 20:14.254
No.

20:15.256 --> 20:20.466
I wish for the two women whom I find
to be the most beautiful in the world

20:21.929 --> 20:23.509
to be in love with me

20:24.932 --> 20:28.812
and to be right here
at this very moment.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.854
Done!

21:29.079 --> 21:30.079
Oh!

21:44.178 --> 21:47.428
Ah, true love.

21:50.601 --> 21:51.851
So, talk to me.

21:52.686 --> 21:56.476
- About what?
- You and Greg. Ls everything all right?

21:56.482 --> 21:57.482
We're fine.

21:58.526 --> 22:01.776
You still haven't told him
those three magic words, have you?

22:03.155 --> 22:05.155
- Katie.
- Repeat after me.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.117
L... Love... You.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.747
<i>You're gonna lose him, girlfriend.</i>

22:10.955 --> 22:13.745
Keep that wall up,
and he's eventually gonna walk.

22:13.958 --> 22:17.038
- You haven't yet.
- Yeah, well,

22:17.294 --> 22:19.964
that's because I'm a woman,
i can see through walls.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.954
Men lack X-ray vision.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.089
Yeah.

22:24.969 --> 22:28.349
- That they do.
- Speaking of the weaker sex.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.184
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.392
Come here, baby.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.144
Sorry.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.939
All right, let's go see the movie.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.357
What's wrong?

22:55.541 --> 22:57.251
Hey, are you okay?

23:00.421 --> 23:03.661
Um, barash, i... I just saw him.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.887
You just saw barash?

23:07.595 --> 23:09.635
You need a doctor, di.

23:09.638 --> 23:13.978
No, just-just give me a second, okay?

23:16.562 --> 23:18.882
- I gotta go.
- What are you talking about? Go where?

23:18.981 --> 23:20.771
I forgot something back at the lab.

23:21.734 --> 23:26.164
- I'll come with you.
- No! Just... I'll find you later. Okay?

23:34.038 --> 23:38.958
- What the hell am I doing wrong?
- Just give her some space. She'll come around.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.273
Hmm.

23:57.645 --> 24:01.765
Ahh. Ooh.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.016
Thank you, professor.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.856
Return to sender.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.495
Ah, "the lliad." Hmm?

24:56.996 --> 24:58.656
I knew the author.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.093
Hah.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.956
Professor?

26:40.432 --> 26:43.732
Mr. kid! Katie!

26:44.269 --> 26:46.059
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.534
Where, oh, where could she be?

27:02.371 --> 27:04.291
Ah, I like this game.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.535
Here, Katie, Katie, Katie, Katie.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.796
My sneaky little wench.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.262
Boo!

27:30.732 --> 27:31.902
Sucker!

27:32.651 --> 27:33.931
Whatever. I knew you were there.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.947
<i>Yeah, fight.
Go change your boxers.</i>

27:37.656 --> 27:40.656
- Wait! Where-where you going?
- Back to the labyrinth.

27:40.659 --> 27:44.369
- My ass is <i>grass</i> if she finds out I snatched it.
- But you looked horny.

27:44.538 --> 27:47.368
You're so romantic.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.333
Wait!

27:52.171 --> 27:53.171
You like that, huh?

27:54.339 --> 27:56.219
Hey, you, uh...
You feeling bold?

27:56.550 --> 27:57.800
Always.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.640
All right, trust me.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.722
- Hold on!
- No, it's gotta be now! Asap.

28:02.723 --> 28:05.433
- Why?
- 'Cause the coast is clear. Huh? Huh?

28:05.767 --> 28:07.837
You know what I'm talking about?

28:07.936 --> 28:10.726
Come here.
Ladies, first.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.861
Mmm. Oh.
Go to the left.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.408
- So beautiful.
- Oh, yeah?

28:28.582 --> 28:31.782
Are you high?
Somebody's gonna come in.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.627
"Sex in a public place: Ls it hotter?"

28:34.880 --> 28:37.970
- Mm.
- First-person experiment.

28:40.052 --> 28:43.892
- My naughty little scientist.
- Oh, behave.

Get in here and lock the door.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.001
Check it out.

30:40.839 --> 30:41.839
It's nice.

30:42.466 --> 30:44.126
These are the field notes from the dig.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.546
Listen, can we talk?

30:46.970 --> 30:49.220
"January 5, 2000. We finally reached
the fifth level."

30:49.681 --> 30:51.811
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
"On the sixth day,

30:52.225 --> 30:54.385
"the box was discovered
in a secret chamber,

30:54.394 --> 30:56.304
"concealed and protected on all sides.

30:56.396 --> 30:59.566
The box appears to be persian in origin
and dates back to the 12th century."

31:00.108 --> 31:01.628
- I'll come back later.
- No, no, wait.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.867
The inscription on the box warns
that it holds the secret stone of fire.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.818
Uh-huh.

31:07.366 --> 31:11.286
And that legend dictates
that an ancient race of demons,

31:11.286 --> 31:12.946
the djinn,
are trapped inside the stone.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.800
Don't you get it?
It's the heart of the myth.

31:17.209 --> 31:20.379
It's like an evil Aladdin's lamp
or pandora's box.

31:20.670 --> 31:21.840
You know?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.627
I found the stone, Greg.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.335
I opened the box,
i touched it with my own hands.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.256
You're actually buying that?

31:31.264 --> 31:32.564
Do you love me?

31:33.308 --> 31:37.018
- Actually, that's what I came to ask you.
- Just answer my question.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.020
You know I do.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.562
Then you trust me?

31:41.566 --> 31:42.686
Absolutely.

31:45.153 --> 31:49.063
My, uh, episode
in the common room,

31:49.157 --> 31:51.157
I saw something.

31:51.159 --> 31:55.709
I know it sounds nuts, but I saw barash
clear as day in his office being murdered.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.749
Please, he had... he had the stone.

32:02.337 --> 32:05.587
L... I went back to his office,
and it was a complete mess.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.262
He was gone, so was the stone.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.970
His tutorial was open with a fresh drop
of blood right next to my name.

32:12.222 --> 32:14.432
Di, that could mean anything.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.926
And now he's not answering his phone,
he's not answering his cell.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.395
His car's still in the parking lot.
Nobody can find him.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.306
- Okay, calm down.
- For Christ's sake!

32:21.314 --> 32:23.284
Any idiot can see
that something's wrong.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.822
I'm sorry. I just...

32:29.448 --> 32:31.448
I really need you
to hear me right now.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.620
I do hear you, di.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.421
But I need you to hear me too.

32:40.876 --> 32:43.166
You didn't answer my question.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.666
I understand that
because of your past

32:48.675 --> 32:50.835
you may have fears of intimacy.

32:50.844 --> 32:54.394
Can we please talk about this later?

32:54.681 --> 32:58.271
What I don't understand
is your refusal to get help.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.188
I never will, di.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.728
Jesus! Professor,
what are you doing here?

33:56.826 --> 33:58.506
I didn't mean to startle you, Ms. kauflan.

33:59.871 --> 34:04.611
You're looking a little more presentable
than usual. Big date tonight?

34:04.709 --> 34:09.458
- Indeed.
- Who's the lucky girl? I mean, woman.

34:09.464 --> 34:13.884
I need to see a transcript
of Diana Collins, please.

34:13.885 --> 34:19.094
My dear professor, you of all people
know these files are confidential.

34:19.099 --> 34:21.918
Of course. However,

34:22.018 --> 34:26.018
miss Collins has made representations
about her grade point average

34:26.022 --> 34:29.232
to the university in order to secure
a research position,

34:29.234 --> 34:32.284
and I need to confirm
the veracity of her application.

34:32.571 --> 34:35.621
Can't release a file without
a student's official consent.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.117
I understand.

34:37.118 --> 34:42.998
Unfortunately, we need to confirm
the position tonight.

34:42.998 --> 34:46.038
And we're unable to locate miss Collins.

34:46.042 --> 34:50.992
So, if you could make
an exception this one time,

34:51.089 --> 34:52.469
we'd be very grateful.

34:55.552 --> 34:59.972
Your gratitude is the last thing
i need right now, professor.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.064
Well, what is it exactly
that you do need?

35:08.315 --> 35:11.775
What would you wish for
above all else?

35:14.029 --> 35:17.569
You're gonna make
all my dreams come true?

35:18.742 --> 35:19.742
Is that it?

35:20.577 --> 35:22.247
Just one wish at a time.

35:22.746 --> 35:27.126
Okay, fine.
You want a wish?

35:27.292 --> 35:32.172
I wish this whole mountain of files
would go up in flames,

35:32.172 --> 35:34.972
so I could get the hell
out of here.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.838
I wish you hadn't said that.

35:42.432 --> 35:45.062
Are you with me, child?

36:06.289 --> 36:09.129
All I wanted was a simple file.

36:22.138 --> 36:24.928
Hey, Charlie, you wanna go down to
campus security and grab that report?

36:24.933 --> 36:26.023
Yeah.

36:26.393 --> 36:27.523
All right.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.760
Hey.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.352
What are you doing?

37:04.139 --> 37:05.679
Hey, come back here!

37:51.519 --> 37:55.759
Good morning, ladies, gentlemen.
Diana Collins?

37:55.857 --> 37:59.317
You should know, professor.
She's always late.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.334
All right, then, let's get started.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.871
"The pride of agamemnon and its role
in extending the trojan war."

38:10.872 --> 38:15.282
Ah, yes, trojan war...
One of my favorites.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.706
But the question is flawed.

38:17.712 --> 38:21.882
The extension of the trojan war
had less to do with agamemnon

38:21.883 --> 38:25.683
as with... the djinn.

38:25.887 --> 38:29.347
We haven't covered the djinn myth yet.
That's next semester.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.691
Really?

38:34.395 --> 38:37.725
Well, how do you hope
to understand the trojan war

38:37.732 --> 38:40.322
without studying the djinn myth?

38:41.903 --> 38:45.183
The greeks may have
worshiped them as Zeus,

38:45.281 --> 38:47.991
bacchus, hera, Aphrodite,

38:47.992 --> 38:49.542
but they were djinn
all the same.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.582
Take, uh, Helen of Troy,
for example.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.254
History has judged her to be a tramp...

39:00.588 --> 39:05.088
Who left her respectable husband
for a young lover.

39:05.093 --> 39:08.333
But if you'd met Paris, you would know
that this could not possibly be true.

39:08.429 --> 39:11.009
Paris was a rather pathetic specimen

39:11.015 --> 39:15.435
whose tastes ran to goats and boys,
rather than other men's wives.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.596
Or students.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.975
You wish to talk in my class?

39:21.901 --> 39:23.821
Stand up.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.810
Do you wish to talk in my class?

39:27.907 --> 39:29.777
No.

39:29.784 --> 39:34.024
As I was saying,
a rather pathetic specimen.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.042
Sit down.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.792
The truth about Helen,

39:39.794 --> 39:44.534
a rather sweet, if plain, girl,

39:44.632 --> 39:48.802
was that she merely asked the djinn
to make everybody fall in love with her.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.803
Simple wish,

39:50.805 --> 39:52.715
but very unspecific.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.712
The result was a 10-year war

39:56.811 --> 40:01.721
and the total destruction
of the trojan civilization.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.816
Now, where is Diana?

40:24.297 --> 40:26.627
"And when god breathed fire
into the universe,

40:26.633 --> 40:30.413
"and the light gave birth to angels,
and the earth gave birth to man,

40:30.511 --> 40:32.541
"and the fire gave birth to the djinn,

40:32.639 --> 40:35.969
"creatures condemned to dwell
in the void between the worlds.

40:35.975 --> 40:39.645
"One who wakes the djinn shall be given three
wishes. Upon the granting of the third,

40:39.646 --> 40:44.266
"the unholy legions of the djinn
shall be freed upon the earth.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.695
Fear one thing...
Fear the djinn."

41:23.606 --> 41:25.476
If you see Diana, could you
tell her I'm looking for her.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.483
Sure thing.

41:42.792 --> 41:43.822
What's up?

41:43.918 --> 41:46.498
- Don't look up. Just turn left
and meet me around the corner.

41:48.631 --> 41:49.631
Okay.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.099
- You're okay.
- Ohhh.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.258
What's barash doing up there?

42:06.357 --> 42:09.227
I don't know. But he's sure got
a hard-on to talk to you.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.985
Wait... he knows my name?

42:10.987 --> 42:12.737
Yeah. No shit, Sherlock.

42:13.322 --> 42:14.562
Well, what the hell's going on?

42:14.615 --> 42:17.025
- We gotta get outta here. Please!
- Would you just calm down!

42:17.035 --> 42:20.075
No! Talk to us now.

42:23.916 --> 42:26.036
Look, some things
are impossible to believe,

42:26.044 --> 42:29.454
and yet the curse
of tutankhamen's tomb, for example,

42:29.547 --> 42:32.967
or the reality of Dracula
and vlad the impaler...

42:33.718 --> 42:34.718
Please!

42:36.387 --> 42:37.847
You guys have to trust me on...

42:38.306 --> 42:39.426
Barash isn't barash.

42:40.558 --> 42:41.558
<i>He's...</i>

42:41.559 --> 42:44.099
Being possessed by some kind
of a demon called a djinn.

42:44.604 --> 42:47.384
- Not this again.
- Goddamn, di, this is the best one yet.

42:47.482 --> 42:51.532
This isn't one of our fucking games, Billy.
Barash and Ms. kauflan are dead.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.743
Who is Ms. kauflan?

42:55.281 --> 42:58.371
She was killed in the fire last night.

42:58.826 --> 43:01.906
- At the admin building?
- Yes! The djinn burned her to death.

43:02.497 --> 43:05.997
- You mean professor barash.
- This isn't a joke, Katie.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.520
Yeah, Kat. I mean, you k now, our exams
are gonna be murder now.

43:08.795 --> 43:11.585
Barash is dead.
I saw him killed last night.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.009
The djinn has taken over his body.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.836
Well, give it up, Collins, all right?

43:17.845 --> 43:21.095
I suddenly need a pint.
I think you should have one too.

43:21.099 --> 43:22.679
- Let's go.
- You know what? I tried.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.689
Wait! Just wait there!

43:27.688 --> 43:28.728
Please help me.

43:29.649 --> 43:30.649
For Christ sakes, Jansen.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.898
I mean, come on, buddy,
she's yanking your chain,

43:32.902 --> 43:35.222
and you're sucking it up
like a hoover deluxe.

43:35.321 --> 43:37.841
- What's wrong with you?
- She's been on this kick since last night.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.235
- It isn't...
- A new joke.

43:39.867 --> 43:42.787
If we could just get her to health
services, somebody could check her out.

43:43.204 --> 43:44.214
Please!

43:44.789 --> 43:45.789
Fine.

43:45.873 --> 43:49.343
What?
Oh, man, I do not believe this.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.125
Believe it. You coming?

43:51.129 --> 43:52.449
Let me put it this way, all right:

43:52.547 --> 43:55.627
I don't fall for strippers
or hookers or lame-ass jokes.

43:55.883 --> 43:57.723
So, no. Bye.

43:58.803 --> 44:01.683
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

44:03.224 --> 44:05.274
No, I tell you, I can explain...

44:05.768 --> 44:08.348
I don't wanna hear another word, okay?
You're either with me or not.

44:08.354 --> 44:11.884
And if you're not, get lost
and stop slowing me down.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.983
Hey, what now?

44:13.985 --> 44:17.395
If the djinn grants three of my wishes,
he has the power to open the gates of hell.

44:17.405 --> 44:20.065
- That's bad, right?
- Don't patronize me, Katie.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.024
I don't have time.
Okay, look.

44:22.118 --> 44:25.648
Barash was talking about the djinn
in class today.

44:25.746 --> 44:28.996
- He was?
- Yeah. What does that mean?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.030
- It means I'm telling the truth.
- Okay, fine.

44:31.127 --> 44:34.957
Let's say that you are. There must be something
we can do... get a priest or something?

44:34.964 --> 44:38.204
Doesn't work that way,
at least not in anything I've read.

44:38.301 --> 44:40.091
That's why we're here.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.977
Well, looks like I'm finally
gonna hit the books.

45:00.573 --> 45:05.193
Folks, sign in here, please.
Sign in here, please.

45:05.286 --> 45:09.786
Excuse me. Excuse me, if you're not part
of the dorm, you have to sign in!

45:10.666 --> 45:12.666
Hello! Hello!

45:18.466 --> 45:19.466
How you doing?

45:19.884 --> 45:21.974
You're tight with the faculty, right?

45:22.803 --> 45:24.013
Some of them.

45:24.013 --> 45:28.563
What's this I hear about
a Ms. kauflan being burned?

45:30.061 --> 45:34.691
It's true. Deep-fried and extra crispy.
They're trying to keep it quiet.

45:36.484 --> 45:38.974
Oh, professor.

45:39.070 --> 45:41.400
- Hi.
- Diana Collins.

45:41.405 --> 45:44.195
Sure. Would you like me
to ring up to her room?

45:44.200 --> 45:46.030
No, thanks,
I'll just get a room number.

45:46.035 --> 45:49.075
Actually, she just went over
to zeta lambda.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.900
Really?

45:50.998 --> 45:54.288
Yeah.
Her and Elinor Smith,

45:54.293 --> 45:56.173
they're working
on an assignment together.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.675
Pizza! Pizza my place!

46:02.593 --> 46:05.083
Uh, Diana and Elinor?
I don't think so.

46:05.179 --> 46:07.749
No, believe it.

46:07.848 --> 46:10.768
Heading over to the party,
so if you, uh, see Katie...

46:10.768 --> 46:12.728
- Yeah, I'll tell her.
- Thank you.

Where's Diana?

47:48.324 --> 47:49.994
She's hiding under the bed.

48:08.677 --> 48:11.927
Is there something
that I can help you with?

48:28.697 --> 48:31.117
No wonder she's freaked out.

48:32.243 --> 48:33.743
It's just a book, Katie.

48:34.245 --> 48:35.745
Have you read any Greek myths?

48:35.746 --> 48:39.496
Like this one, medea. There's some
seriously twisted shit in here.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.420
And the persian stuff
is even sicker.

48:43.421 --> 48:46.131
We have to try and help di.

48:46.132 --> 48:49.832
I know all this stuff
has something to do with barash.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.717
Look, all we can do
is stick by her until she...

48:52.721 --> 48:55.721
Hey, um, I gotta double-check
something back in my room.

48:57.601 --> 48:58.601
Let's book.

49:01.897 --> 49:04.397
He's probably nursing
his inner child in some bar.

49:09.738 --> 49:12.828
Hi! Hey, 9w5-

49:16.579 --> 49:18.499
okay, fine.

49:23.335 --> 49:24.665
Yeah, she's really hot.

49:27.965 --> 49:31.545
- Is she back?
- Room 432.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.097
That way.

49:40.436 --> 49:41.436
Hey, let me...

49:42.938 --> 49:44.898
Shit.

49:48.819 --> 49:52.869
Hello, professor.
What are you doing up here?

49:53.699 --> 49:54.699
Social call.

49:55.034 --> 49:56.244
Anyone I know?

49:58.662 --> 49:59.872
Intimately.

50:01.373 --> 50:04.903
Look, professor,
whether you're aware of it or not,

50:05.002 --> 50:08.202
di's dealing with some
pretty heavy issues right now.

50:08.297 --> 50:10.297
I know she doesn't need you
adding to them.

50:10.299 --> 50:14.539
What I know, young man,
would make you insane.

50:14.637 --> 50:17.467
I trust my girlfriend, professor.

50:17.473 --> 50:20.713
Do you, indeed?

50:20.809 --> 50:22.309
Implicitly.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.516
I see.

50:24.522 --> 50:26.552
Well, certainly, I want
what's best for Diana too,

50:26.649 --> 50:30.109
and if you wish it,
i will leave you in peace.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.280
I thank you.

50:44.917 --> 50:48.667
Tell her: Three wishes.

50:48.671 --> 50:51.671
Otherwise the souls closest
to her will perish...

50:51.674 --> 50:53.474
Horribly.

50:56.804 --> 50:59.774
Run and tell, little boy.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.638
You okay?

51:38.429 --> 51:40.009
Diana was right about barash.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.220
What the hell are you talking about?

51:41.223 --> 51:43.353
Diana was right. I saw it.

51:43.934 --> 51:44.934
Saw what?

51:46.395 --> 51:47.975
Barash is not barash.

51:48.564 --> 51:52.364
All that crazy shit that Diana
was talking about is true.

51:53.027 --> 51:53.937
What?

51:53.945 --> 51:55.315
He's after Diana.

51:56.989 --> 51:58.949
- Where the hell is Billy?
- I don't know!

51:58.949 --> 52:02.289
When you find him, bail.
We gotta get off the campus.

52:26.769 --> 52:28.979
- Hi.
- Sorry.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.979
Diana, that's my line.

52:33.442 --> 52:34.762
He's gonna kill us.

52:34.860 --> 52:36.140
Not a chance.

52:36.236 --> 52:38.316
I know someone who can help.

52:53.295 --> 52:54.295
Father Norton!

52:55.422 --> 52:57.342
- Can we...
- Father Norton's a little tied up.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.460
Diana, why do I get the feeling
you're avoiding me?

53:04.556 --> 53:07.386
A church... so predictable.

53:07.393 --> 53:11.093
Common human frailty thinking
that god cares. He doesn't.

53:11.188 --> 53:16.648
You're on your own.
That's the downside to free will.

53:16.652 --> 53:18.112
What do you want from me?

53:19.238 --> 53:22.908
I want to Grant you every wish,
fulfill your every desire.

53:22.908 --> 53:25.868
- Oh, like you did the professor?
- You're a very brave girl.

53:25.869 --> 53:27.899
Do you think Greg will be so strong?

53:27.996 --> 53:30.076
He has nothing to do with this.

53:30.082 --> 53:31.882
Well, he doesn't have to.

53:32.209 --> 53:33.419
Not if you make your wishes.

53:33.419 --> 53:35.039
You can't kill us
if we don't make a wish.

53:35.045 --> 53:37.505
Where'd you get that,
from one of your textbooks?

53:38.173 --> 53:39.173
Let's go.

53:39.675 --> 53:40.675
Oh, Ann!

53:43.095 --> 53:44.255
Sorry, Diana.

53:44.638 --> 53:48.418
You got bumped.
I'm the professor's t.A. Now.

53:48.517 --> 53:53.097
- No, Ann, listen to me.
- Too late for that. Ann's already made her wish.

53:53.105 --> 53:54.185
Professor.

53:55.274 --> 53:56.634
She wants to lose a little weight.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.318
Make your wish.

54:00.195 --> 54:01.195
No.

54:02.698 --> 54:03.698
Your decision.

54:13.834 --> 54:16.344
- What's happening?
- Just a little liposuction.

54:17.838 --> 54:21.468
Anorexia's such
a debilitating disease, don't you think?

54:24.344 --> 54:28.024
And now, her stomach. You've always thought
of that as your problem area, haven't you?

54:34.855 --> 54:36.895
Only you can help her, Diana.

54:39.234 --> 54:41.284
Make it stop!

54:44.281 --> 54:45.871
God, make it stop!

54:48.076 --> 54:49.996
[Gagging 1

54:52.539 --> 54:54.899
are you gonna fail your friend
like you failed your parents?

54:56.043 --> 54:57.993
Failed them with your selfishness?

54:58.086 --> 55:02.416
With your childish whining
and your cowardice as they burned alive?

55:02.424 --> 55:04.094
No.

55:06.220 --> 55:10.100
Only you can ease her pain, Diana.
Only you can save her.

55:26.406 --> 55:28.616
- Make your wish!
- Okay!

55:28.617 --> 55:31.037
Just stop her pain, please.
I wish it.

55:38.752 --> 55:41.242
- You lying piece of shit!
- You said...

55:41.338 --> 55:44.628
Hey!
I stopped the pain.

55:44.633 --> 55:46.703
You have to be more specific.
Now make your second wish.

55:46.802 --> 55:47.972
Never!

55:49.179 --> 55:52.209
- Ah!
- How many friends do you have, Diana?

55:52.307 --> 55:54.387
Make a wish!

55:54.393 --> 55:56.313
- Don't trust him.
- Silence!

56:01.650 --> 56:05.490
Make the wish
while you still have time!

56:12.619 --> 56:17.539
I wish to invoke the spirit of
the angel Michael to help me stop you.

56:18.667 --> 56:19.997
Clever girl.

56:37.728 --> 56:38.938
Greg.

56:40.981 --> 56:41.981
Greg.

57:01.585 --> 57:04.545
Who freed you from the pit, demon?

57:04.546 --> 57:07.876
The same girl
who wished you here.

57:09.217 --> 57:12.297
- Greg?
- Michael.

57:12.304 --> 57:16.294
Your misguided heroics
have condemned you all.

57:16.391 --> 57:19.271
Leave here.

57:31.573 --> 57:33.583
Just like the old days, Michael.

57:33.951 --> 57:37.661
The angels running
before the djinn like sheep.

57:38.330 --> 57:41.040
- We won the war.
- You won the battle.

57:41.375 --> 57:45.245
The war goes on.

59:03.123 --> 59:04.123
In here.

59:05.417 --> 59:06.417
Get back!

59:38.909 --> 59:41.119
Professor, where are you going?

59:41.119 --> 59:44.409
- Wanna come to the party?
- Oh, professor.

59:44.414 --> 59:47.324
- Oh, come on.
- I'll catch up with you guys.

59:47.417 --> 59:50.697
Now what are you looking for?

59:50.796 --> 59:53.376
Will you please turn around?

59:57.552 --> 59:59.552
What do you want?

59:59.554 --> 01:00:02.894
I have a thing for older men.

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:13.569
I'm older than you can ever imagine.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:16.347
Oh, come on, professor.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.736
That's exactly what makes you
so attractive.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:26.118
I'm sick of all these brain-dead,
post-pubescent horn dogs.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.420
They're so easy to toy with.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.280
But you,

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:36.009
you strike me as a man
who could break a girl's heart.

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:40.799
Do you wish me to break your heart,
younglady?

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:43.564
Oh, yes, please.

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:00.067
As you wish.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:15.754
No!

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.240
Elinor's dead.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.412
The djinn will use your friends
against you.

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:57.086
Is Greg dead?

01:01:57.088 --> 01:02:01.588
I sense him...
Somewhere.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:04.793
Can we bring him back?

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.218
Only if we defeat the djinn.

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.673
And we might have in the church,
had your man kept his head.

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:12.348
What Greg did, he did because...

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.470
Can he hear me?

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.186
I don't know.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.782
Greg?

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.361
Oh, god, you're bleeding.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.338
It'll pass.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:40.839
Where are you going?

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:44.143
To get some water to clean you up.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.728
Can I have my hand back?

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:55.194
Thank you.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.293
You guys seen Katie York?

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.418
You guys seen Katie York?

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.921
Has anybody seen Katie York?

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.897
Lift your arm.

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.528
Enough!

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:02.086
This isn't your body.
It's his, and mine.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:04.128
So don't forget that.

01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:06.132
You summoned the demon, woman.

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:09.504
These wounds should be
the least of your concerns.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:11.806
When I touched the stone,
i didn't know that...

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:14.216
That much is clear, woman.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.935
Would you stop
with this "woman" thing?

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:22.149
You have released a demon
and started a war

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:24.640
that could burn down
the gates of heaven.

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:27.396
I didn't wish for you to come down here
and give me a lecture.

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:29.865
I wished for you to come down here
and help me kill the djinn.

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:32.076
I can't.

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:33.624
What?

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:36.117
Only the waker may kill the djinn.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:40.036
Perfect.

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:42.592
Is Katie in there?

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.018
Katie?

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:00.398
Come on. Open up.

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:04.362
Katie?

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.372
Diana?

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:12.576
Hello?

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.870
Guys?

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:22.283
- We must run.
- That's it? That's your plan?

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:24.947
No weapon from this world
can kill the djinn.

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:26.226
That's not from this world.

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:28.837
The sword of justice will be yours
when you are ready.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:36.598
- He's in my head again.
- Fight it! You can shut him out.

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.729
I can't!

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:45.154
Say hello to Billy, Diana.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:46.775
No!

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:49.349
Well, well, well.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.816
What are you doing here?

You know who I am?

01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:03.755
Yeah, you're some lame-ass professor
who's got a thing for his students.

- Strong but powerless.

- We have to leave them.
- I'm not leaving without Katie.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:48.827

- I don't care.

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:51.323
Come on, Katie. Pick up!

01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:53.629
She's gonna die
unless we do something.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:57.630
If the djinn grants your third wish,
the earth will become a living hell.

Sacrifices must be made.

Would you give your life
to save the world?

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:41.724
That was foolish.

you will be ready.

Until then, we must evade him.
