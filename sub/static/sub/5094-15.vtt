WEBVTT

00:08.802 --> 00:10.202
It's supposed to be
a good school.

00:10.204 --> 00:12.037
Yeah, parents pumped
a lot of money into it.

00:12.039 --> 00:12.972
You know the place?

00:12.974 --> 00:14.206
Caught a case here
a while back.

00:14.208 --> 00:15.174
What do we got?

00:15.176 --> 00:16.976
Ten-year-old female,
Jenna Wallace.

00:16.978 --> 00:18.244
Never made it home
from school.

00:18.246 --> 00:20.379
Parents over there reported
her missing an hour ago.

00:20.381 --> 00:21.480
Any witnesses?

00:21.482 --> 00:23.349
Crossing guard saw
the girl leave the building.

00:23.351 --> 00:25.484
Ma'am, can you tell us
what you saw?

00:25.486 --> 00:27.386
Uh, Jenna had just
crossed the street,

00:27.388 --> 00:30.456
um, a white car pulled up,
a two-door compact sedan,

00:30.458 --> 00:32.124
um, she got in,
they took off.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.726
Did you get a look
at the driver?

00:33.728 --> 00:36.262
No. I didn't catch
the license plate either.

00:36.264 --> 00:38.197
Does Jenna usually get
picked up from school?

00:38.199 --> 00:40.499
No, tha-tha-that's the thing...

00:40.501 --> 00:42.968
she walks home every day
with her friend Stacy.

00:42.970 --> 00:43.936
Really nice kids.

00:43.938 --> 00:45.337
No signs of struggle, huh?

00:45.339 --> 00:47.706
No. The way she got
in the car,

00:47.708 --> 00:50.709
it seemed like
she knew the driver.

00:50.711 --> 00:52.378
I keep thinking
I should've done something.

00:52.380 --> 00:54.680
You've been very helpful,
thank you.

00:54.682 --> 00:56.015
I got a bad feeling
about this one.

00:56.017 --> 00:57.580
At least we got the
make and model of the car.

00:57.605 --> 00:58.518
Yeah.

00:58.519 --> 00:59.685
Excuse us.
Detective Reagan.

00:59.687 --> 01:01.220
This is Detective Baez.

01:01.222 --> 01:02.421
You need to find Jenna.

01:02.423 --> 01:04.390
You need to bring
her back to us.

01:04.391 --> 01:05.391
We're gonna do
everything we can.

01:05.393 --> 01:06.892
We'd like for you
two to come down

01:06.894 --> 01:09.094
to the squad room so we can
ask you some questions.

01:09.096 --> 01:10.429
The more information we get,

01:10.431 --> 01:12.431
the better chances are we
can get your daughter back.

01:12.433 --> 01:14.366
Please, you need
to find my baby.

01:14.368 --> 01:15.968
We'll do all we
can, all right?

01:15.970 --> 01:17.425
Get them down to
squad, all right?

01:17.426 --> 01:18.491
Yes, sir.

01:18.639 --> 01:20.005
Start plastering this
neighborhood with

01:20.007 --> 01:21.607
"information wanted" posters.

01:21.609 --> 01:23.576
I'll let Gormley know we need
the whole squad on this.

01:23.578 --> 01:25.444
We got about 72 hours
to find this girl

01:25.446 --> 01:27.813
or chances are we never will.

01:30.650 --> 01:33.152
Ms. Del Rio ran down
the superintendent

01:33.154 --> 01:34.987
in the parking garage
of her building.

01:34.989 --> 01:37.756
I understand the allegations
against Ms. Del Rio.

01:37.758 --> 01:39.124
We have an eyewitness.

01:39.126 --> 01:42.695
Elderly lady and the lighting
was not great, I know that.

01:42.697 --> 01:44.830
I'm so sorry I hurt
Mr. Romanelli. I--

01:44.832 --> 01:46.031
I'm sorry.

01:46.033 --> 01:48.334
You put Mr. Romanelli
in the morgue, ma'am.

01:48.336 --> 01:51.670
That said, in the absence
of concrete proof

01:51.672 --> 01:53.205
that you intended
to kill the victim,

01:53.207 --> 01:55.641
I am prepared to offer
a plea of manslaughter.

01:55.643 --> 01:57.009
That's generous...

01:57.011 --> 01:59.044
in the normal
course of events.

01:59.046 --> 02:01.747
But not in this case,
no, thank you.

02:01.749 --> 02:03.916
I think you should confer
with your client first.

02:03.918 --> 02:05.584
The evidence is overwhelming.

02:05.586 --> 02:11.357
Ms. Del Rio suffers from, uh,
severe bipolar illness.

02:11.359 --> 02:13.759
And she was in a manic state
at the time of the accident...

02:13.761 --> 02:15.294
You're pleading not guilty
by reason of

02:15.296 --> 02:16.962
mental disease or defect.

02:16.964 --> 02:19.498
That is very difficult to prove.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.167
Exactly... but that's why
they pay me the big bucks.

02:29.676 --> 02:32.011
I understand.

02:32.013 --> 02:34.413
Thanks for the call.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.081
That was Scotland Yard.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.117
Please don't tell me
we're going on another

02:38.119 --> 02:39.518
goodwill trip to London.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.287
That rain's murder
on my sciatica.

02:41.289 --> 02:43.923
There is not a lot of goodwill
flowing at the moment.

02:43.925 --> 02:46.592
They've detained one
of our intelligence officers,

02:46.594 --> 02:48.160
Detective Paul Hailey.

02:48.162 --> 02:49.495
On what charge?

02:49.497 --> 02:51.497
There was a terrorist bombing
at a West End tube station.

02:51.499 --> 02:52.865
I know that.

02:52.867 --> 02:54.300
Hailey is being accused

02:54.302 --> 02:56.602
of entering the scene
and handling evidence

02:56.604 --> 02:58.971
without authorization.
He's doing his job.

02:58.973 --> 03:02.107
Yeah! He found the cause of the
blast and reported his findings.

03:02.109 --> 03:03.075
What'd he find?

03:04.946 --> 03:07.146
That's all I can tell you.

03:07.148 --> 03:10.115
That's all you <i>can</i> tell me
or all you <i>will</i> tell me?

03:12.053 --> 03:14.386
I can't handle this if
I don't know what's going on!

03:14.388 --> 03:15.387
There's nothing to handle.

03:15.389 --> 03:16.355
You know there will be.

03:16.357 --> 03:19.325
Garrett, you are
my deputy commissioner

03:19.327 --> 03:20.793
of public information.

03:20.795 --> 03:22.561
This is private information.

03:26.232 --> 03:28.300
So, what do we
got on your end?

03:28.302 --> 03:29.668
We're canvassing
the neighborhood,

03:29.670 --> 03:32.037
checking all the surveillance
cameras near the school,

03:32.039 --> 03:34.473
running all vehicles
matching the description

03:34.475 --> 03:36.342
registered in the area.
Good.

03:36.344 --> 03:37.710
I'll get TARU to download
their content

03:37.712 --> 03:39.411
from the past few days...
Sounds like a plan.

03:39.413 --> 03:41.246
I'm running all recent parolees.
Here you go, Reagan.

03:41.248 --> 03:42.247
Thank you.

03:42.249 --> 03:44.583
Checking the sex
offender registry...

03:44.585 --> 03:47.219
see if there's any twists
living in the neighborhood.

03:47.221 --> 03:48.587
Hey, Detective.

03:50.957 --> 03:52.625
Mr. Scott...

03:52.627 --> 03:54.093
um...

03:54.095 --> 03:56.729
my new partner, Maria Baez.

03:56.731 --> 03:58.197
Joseph.
Good to meet you.

03:58.199 --> 04:00.299
So, you heard,
it's happened again.

04:00.301 --> 04:01.266
Yeah, I heard.

04:01.268 --> 04:02.735
Uh... we caught
the case in fact.

04:02.737 --> 04:05.137
That's great.
It's the same school.

04:05.139 --> 04:06.338
It's the same time of day.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.240
Am I missing something?

04:08.242 --> 04:10.776
Joseph's daughter Allie was
abducted from the same school

04:10.778 --> 04:11.677
seven years ago.

04:11.679 --> 04:14.647
Seven years,
two months, 14 days.

04:14.649 --> 04:17.082
Danny worked 'round the clock
to find Allie.

04:17.084 --> 04:18.617
He puts up with me...

04:18.619 --> 04:21.053
coming by, chewing his ear,
giving him updates.

04:21.055 --> 04:23.622
Yeah, unfortunately, I wasn't
able to bring Allie back to you.

04:23.624 --> 04:25.457
But this is a big break, right?

04:25.459 --> 04:26.959
I mean, whoever took this girl,

04:26.961 --> 04:28.861
maybe they know something
about my Allie.

04:30.564 --> 04:33.832
You know, we kind of
went over this before.

04:33.834 --> 04:35.834
The odds of finding somebody
after all this time...

04:35.836 --> 04:37.269
I know the statistics.

04:37.271 --> 04:39.772
I also know in my heart that
Allie's out there somewhere.

04:39.774 --> 04:41.240
She has to be.

04:42.475 --> 04:44.643
Don't give up on her, Danny.

05:16.121 --> 05:18.321
This a recent picture of Jenna?

05:18.323 --> 05:19.422
It's her school photo.

05:19.424 --> 05:20.857
They took it last month.

05:20.859 --> 05:22.125
Do you know if
she's had any, uh,

05:22.127 --> 05:24.427
incidents lately, fights,
arguments with anyone?

05:24.429 --> 05:26.696
No...

05:26.698 --> 05:28.031
She's a sweet girl.

05:28.033 --> 05:30.600
The crossing guard said
it looked like Jenna might have

05:30.602 --> 05:32.168
known the driver
who picked her up.

05:32.170 --> 05:33.903
That's not possible.

05:33.905 --> 05:35.538
All right.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.007
We need you to write down
any adults your daughter

05:37.009 --> 05:38.608
might have come
in contact with, okay?

05:38.610 --> 05:40.343
Coaches, crossing guards,

05:40.345 --> 05:42.379
teachers, counselors,
whatever you can think of, okay?

05:42.381 --> 05:44.881
Nobody we know
would do something like that.

05:44.883 --> 05:46.950
With all due respect,
you don't know that.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.488
There's a lot
of bad people out there.

06:01.632 --> 06:04.234
Hey, you should go easy
with these people.

06:04.236 --> 06:05.568
I told them the truth.

06:05.570 --> 06:07.771
They are scared enough
without hearing about

06:07.773 --> 06:09.439
what people are
capable of, Danny.

06:09.441 --> 06:11.074
I'm not gonna lie to them.

06:11.076 --> 06:13.109
There's a good chance
this is gonna go bad, okay?

06:13.111 --> 06:14.544
So they should be
prepared for that.

06:14.546 --> 06:17.314
And if that happens we'll
deal with it, but for now,

06:17.316 --> 06:19.149
hope is all these people have.

06:19.151 --> 06:20.617
Right, like Joseph Scott?

06:20.619 --> 06:22.452
That case was seven years ago

06:22.454 --> 06:24.020
and you did everything
that you could.

06:24.022 --> 06:26.489
I told that guy to have hope.
Now look at him.

06:26.491 --> 06:28.658
He can't move on
with his life.

06:28.660 --> 06:30.093
It's like he walks around
with that look on his face

06:30.095 --> 06:32.329
like he's in a bad movie.

06:32.331 --> 06:35.131
I'm not gonna do that
to these people.

06:40.371 --> 06:43.039
So, in addition
to your private practice,

06:43.041 --> 06:44.874
you lecture at Columbia?

06:44.876 --> 06:48.144
I'm a professor of
law and psychiatry.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.647
Well, Amanda Harris speaks
very highly of you.

06:50.649 --> 06:52.949
I've testified for her
many times over the years.

06:52.951 --> 06:54.284
Never lost a case.

06:54.286 --> 06:57.120
Obviously the case against
Ms. Del Rio hinges on her

06:57.122 --> 06:59.689
mental state at the
time of the incident.

06:59.691 --> 07:02.826
Bipolar illness is a serious
disorder, but in my experience

07:02.828 --> 07:05.462
defense attorneys tend
to exaggerate the severity

07:05.464 --> 07:08.264
of their clients' symptoms
to keep them out of jail.

07:08.266 --> 07:10.166
Well, in this case,
defense counsel is

07:10.168 --> 07:13.036
particularly aggressive
and he does his homework.

07:13.038 --> 07:15.538
I'm confident
I can handle anything

07:15.540 --> 07:16.906
the defense throws my way.

07:16.908 --> 07:19.909
Great. I'll have the file
sent over to your office

07:19.911 --> 07:21.778
and arrange for you
to interview the defendant.

07:21.780 --> 07:24.147
Don't worry, Ms. Reagan.

07:24.149 --> 07:25.782
I've never let this office down.

07:25.784 --> 07:27.550
I don't intend to start now.

07:29.687 --> 07:32.689
I think it's all just
a misunderstanding, Mr. Mayor.

07:32.691 --> 07:34.023
Nothing for you to worry about.

07:34.025 --> 07:35.358
Nothing I can't handle.

07:37.128 --> 07:38.294
No, sir.

07:39.230 --> 07:40.430
Yes, sir.

07:41.532 --> 07:42.632
I'm sorry, I have to go.

07:42.634 --> 07:44.367
I have a meeting.

07:44.369 --> 07:46.302
No, sir, it's not about this.

07:48.506 --> 07:50.640
It's just a ceremonial nuisance.

07:52.643 --> 07:54.177
You'll be the first to know.

07:54.179 --> 07:56.913
FBI Assistant Director
Tomasetti's here.

07:56.915 --> 07:59.382
Let's have him.

08:02.286 --> 08:03.453
Jason.

08:03.455 --> 08:06.189
We got a hell of
a situation here, Frank.

08:06.191 --> 08:07.490
Oh, I don't know why.

08:07.492 --> 08:09.726
There's no evidence
my officer did anything wrong.

08:09.728 --> 08:11.027
The Brits are
threatening to kick

08:11.029 --> 08:13.430
all U.S. intelligence personnel
out of the country.

08:13.432 --> 08:16.966
Well, we both know
that's not gonna happen, Jason.

08:16.968 --> 08:18.034
They're just pissed off.

08:18.036 --> 08:19.102
I can't say I blame them.

08:19.104 --> 08:21.171
We had agents on scene.

08:21.173 --> 08:24.274
You have officers on the
Joint Terrorist Task Force.

08:24.276 --> 08:27.644
You would've been briefed on
any relevant terrorist threat.

08:27.646 --> 08:30.513
I'm responsible for protecting

08:30.515 --> 08:33.216
the number one
terrorist target in the world.

08:33.217 --> 08:36.318
So you'll understand
if I choose to decide

08:36.321 --> 08:38.321
what is and isn't
a relevant threat.

08:38.323 --> 08:41.090
No other U.S. city
maintains its own

08:41.092 --> 08:42.991
independent intelligence force.

08:42.994 --> 08:46.796
No other city lost
3,000 people to terrorism.

08:48.199 --> 08:50.233
Homeland Security has
their hands full.

08:50.235 --> 08:52.435
A vast number
of security priorities.

08:52.437 --> 08:54.971
I have one...

08:56.874 --> 08:58.942
...keeping my city safe.

08:58.944 --> 09:00.777
End of discussion.

09:01.679 --> 09:03.947
You can expect a call
from the director.

09:03.949 --> 09:05.582
Happy to take it.

09:16.427 --> 09:19.462
<i>Nicky?</i>

09:19.464 --> 09:22.031
I'm home.

09:22.033 --> 09:24.701
I got souvlaki
from Grammatico's.

09:30.207 --> 09:32.609
I thought you were
stopping by Grandpa's tonight.

09:32.611 --> 09:33.910
That's tomorrow.

09:33.912 --> 09:34.911
Is everything okay?

09:34.913 --> 09:38.548
Yeah, I was just studying.

09:40.951 --> 09:43.853
Hey, I'm Ben.

09:44.955 --> 09:46.923
Hi, I'm Nicky's mom.

09:46.925 --> 09:48.424
Ben's in my physics class.

09:48.426 --> 09:50.059
We've got
a unit exam tomorrow, so...

09:50.061 --> 09:53.329
You usually study
at the dining room table.

09:54.965 --> 09:57.300
I should go.

09:57.302 --> 09:58.768
Don't.

09:58.770 --> 09:59.903
Stay for dinner.

09:59.905 --> 10:01.738
It's okay.
Right, Mom?

10:01.740 --> 10:03.740
Yeah.

10:03.742 --> 10:04.841
Great.

10:04.843 --> 10:06.342
Let's eat.

10:20.225 --> 10:21.357
Here you go.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.992
Is Jenna gonna be okay?

10:22.994 --> 10:25.662
Uh, we're trying really hard
to find her, Stacy.

10:26.897 --> 10:28.331
So you two walk home
together every day?

10:28.333 --> 10:29.732
We live in the same building.

10:29.734 --> 10:30.767
What happened today?

10:30.769 --> 10:32.502
Why didn't you walk home today?

10:32.504 --> 10:33.836
We left school
like we usually do,

10:33.838 --> 10:36.573
but she left her
art project in school.

10:36.575 --> 10:38.441
I couldn't wait
'cause I had a violin lesson.

10:38.443 --> 10:39.409
Okay.

10:39.411 --> 10:40.710
I should have waited.

10:40.712 --> 10:42.011
No. It's not your fault.

10:42.013 --> 10:43.279
I mean...

10:43.281 --> 10:45.982
I told her to just bring the art
project home tomorrow,

10:45.984 --> 10:48.117
but she said her stepfather
would be mad.

10:48.119 --> 10:49.519
Her st...

10:49.521 --> 10:51.454
Mr. Wallace is her stepfather?

10:52.623 --> 10:54.157
Yeah. But they don't
really get along.

10:54.159 --> 10:55.758
He has a really
bad temper

10:55.760 --> 10:57.427
and he's always
yelling at Jenna

10:57.429 --> 10:59.395
and punishing her for no reason.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.698
Okay. Okay.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.166
Well, thank you
for bringing her in.

11:03.168 --> 11:04.667
If we need anything else,
we'll be in touch, okay?

11:04.669 --> 11:07.370
And thank you for your help.

11:09.106 --> 11:11.107
I'll run a triple-I
on Mark Wallace.

11:11.109 --> 11:12.241
Check for any domestic incidents

11:12.243 --> 11:14.711
or complaints from
their address, all right?

11:14.713 --> 11:17.780
Like I said, there are a lot
of bad people out there.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.749
Turns out Mark Wallace
was married once before.

11:56.751 --> 11:58.918
Got arrested five years ago
on a domestic

11:58.920 --> 12:00.853
for pushing around
his first wife.

12:00.855 --> 12:02.622
He's got a history of violence?
I spoke to the ex.

12:02.624 --> 12:04.524
She said, when he was
slapping her around,

12:04.526 --> 12:06.092
they were fighting
about kids.

12:06.094 --> 12:07.694
How many kids they have?

12:07.696 --> 12:10.129
None. Wallace never
wanted to have any.

12:10.131 --> 12:14.000
Thought that they would get
in the way or ruin their relationship.

12:14.002 --> 12:15.168
If he didn't want kids,

12:15.170 --> 12:17.503
why'd he go marry somebody else
who had a kid?

12:17.505 --> 12:19.973
Probably thought
he could deal with it.

12:19.975 --> 12:21.908
Guess he thought wrong.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.618
Dr. Raskin,
in your expert opinion,

12:31.620 --> 12:34.253
was the defendant responsible
for her actions

12:34.255 --> 12:36.155
on the day of the incident?

12:36.157 --> 12:38.925
After studying Ms. Del Rio's
medical history

12:38.927 --> 12:40.927
and examining her directly,

12:40.929 --> 12:44.831
it's my opinion that the effects
of her bipolar illness

12:44.833 --> 12:48.201
were insufficient to cause
such a violent outburst.

12:48.203 --> 12:49.869
Thank you, Doctor.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.844
May it please the court.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.547
Dr. Raskin,

13:01.549 --> 13:05.752
my client's medical history

13:05.754 --> 13:09.389
comprises more than 3,000

13:09.391 --> 13:11.891
pages right here.

13:11.893 --> 13:16.262
And you've had it
for less than 48 hours.

13:16.264 --> 13:19.098
How much of it
did you actually read?

13:19.100 --> 13:22.402
Enough to draw
a reasoned opinion.

13:22.404 --> 13:25.471
So you read the section
about her time

13:25.473 --> 13:28.241
at the Rowe Psychiatric
Hospital?

13:28.243 --> 13:30.043
No.

13:30.045 --> 13:32.845
That's over half the file,
Doctor.

13:32.847 --> 13:34.981
And was the 12-minute session

13:34.983 --> 13:40.420
that you had with my client

13:40.422 --> 13:44.490
enough for you
to draw a reasoned conclusion?

13:44.492 --> 13:47.760
That's not a lot of time,
Dr. Raskin, 12 minutes?

13:47.762 --> 13:50.797
I've been in clinical practice
for 26 years.

13:50.799 --> 13:53.533
I've treated scores
of bipolar patients.

13:53.535 --> 13:57.003
Then you must know
that no two cases

13:57.005 --> 13:58.871
of bipolar illness are the same.

13:58.873 --> 14:01.340
Yes. I also know that your
client's statement to police

14:01.342 --> 14:04.077
exhibited little sign
of delusional thinking,

14:04.079 --> 14:06.345
which one would expect
had she been delusional

14:06.347 --> 14:08.147
during the incident.

14:08.149 --> 14:10.016
Do you think mental illness can

14:10.018 --> 14:12.518
ever cause someone
to commit a crime?

14:12.520 --> 14:16.222
Yes, just not in this case.

14:16.224 --> 14:18.257
And that's based
on your so-called thorough

14:18.259 --> 14:20.593
examination of my client

14:20.595 --> 14:25.765
and your partial perusal
of her medical history, right,

14:25.767 --> 14:28.968
sir?

14:28.970 --> 14:32.505
No further questions,
Your Honor.

14:38.212 --> 14:39.679
Inspector General Peterson,

14:39.681 --> 14:40.913
the commissioner
is expecting you.

14:40.915 --> 14:42.648
Thank you.

14:44.118 --> 14:45.284
Kelly.

14:45.286 --> 14:47.887
Angela Merkel's cell phone.

14:49.490 --> 14:51.157
What?

14:51.159 --> 14:55.661
The NSA tapped the German
chancellor's private cell phone.

14:55.663 --> 14:58.564
I'm sure they had
their good reasons for it,

14:58.566 --> 15:01.134
but I'm also sure you can't find
anyone outside the NSA

15:01.136 --> 15:02.568
who thinks it's a good policy.

15:02.570 --> 15:04.270
This is not that.

15:04.272 --> 15:05.605
Then tell me what this is.

15:05.607 --> 15:09.108
A detective from our
International Liaison Program

15:09.110 --> 15:11.544
was accused of tampering
with a crime scene,

15:11.546 --> 15:13.513
but he was not in fact
tampering.

15:13.515 --> 15:16.516
He was just doing
his very important job.

15:16.518 --> 15:17.984
Says you.

15:17.986 --> 15:20.019
That's right.

15:20.021 --> 15:23.856
We need to know what's out there
before it comes here.

15:23.858 --> 15:25.691
And who besides you knows

15:25.693 --> 15:27.326
the full inner workings
of the program?

15:27.328 --> 15:29.996
I consult with the mayor
and my deputy commissioners

15:29.998 --> 15:31.497
when it is appropriate.

15:31.499 --> 15:33.833
Which, I'm guessing, is never.

15:33.835 --> 15:38.104
It is not on our published
schedules, but it is not never.

15:39.907 --> 15:42.975
Even the FBI and the CIA
are subject

15:42.977 --> 15:44.443
to congressional oversight.

15:44.445 --> 15:46.245
That's their problem.

15:46.247 --> 15:47.547
Frank, it's my job

15:47.549 --> 15:50.116
to make sure
the public understands

15:50.118 --> 15:52.552
what the NYPD is doing
in its name.

15:52.554 --> 15:55.988
Not in this instance.

15:55.990 --> 15:58.558
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.561
The ILP works
because the information

16:01.563 --> 16:03.062
is tightly controlled.

16:03.064 --> 16:06.365
There are no leaks.
And it's gonna stay that way.

16:06.367 --> 16:09.068
But I can assure you
we do not have a wire up

16:09.070 --> 16:12.305
on the German chancellor.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.143
You think
that I kidnapped Jenna?

16:17.145 --> 16:19.078
That's not what I said.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.480
I'm just covering
all my bases here.

16:23.617 --> 16:27.353
Want you to tell me about you
and Jenna's relationship, okay?

16:27.355 --> 16:29.922
I'm sure it's got to be hard
being a stepparent and all.

16:29.924 --> 16:31.490
Tell me about it.

16:31.492 --> 16:33.793
I mean, you have
no real power over them,

16:33.795 --> 16:35.862
and believe me, they know it.
Right.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.531
So you two probably got into it.
Sure.

16:38.533 --> 16:40.132
But it was nothing
out of the ordinary.

16:40.134 --> 16:44.337
Look, I would never hurt Jenna,
okay? Never.

16:44.339 --> 16:45.571
Or course not.

16:45.573 --> 16:48.307
Though you did have an incident
with your ex-wife

16:48.309 --> 16:49.408
a few years ago.

16:49.410 --> 16:52.945
All right, that was
a misunderstanding.

16:52.947 --> 16:55.982
Okay. Incident report says

16:55.984 --> 16:58.684
you shoved her against a
wall causing bodily harm.

16:58.686 --> 17:00.653
She says it's 'cause
you didn't want kids.

17:00.655 --> 17:03.990
It was a little more complicated
than that, all right?

17:03.992 --> 17:06.025
Look, Ellen had
a drinking problem, okay?

17:06.027 --> 17:09.194
I was halfway out
the door when it happened.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.630
It's okay.

17:10.632 --> 17:13.366
You're a drug rep, it says here.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.800
That's what you do for work?

17:14.801 --> 17:18.137
Yes. I was, uh, picking up
some samples in Connecticut.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.806
I was on my way home
when I heard about Jenna.

17:20.808 --> 17:22.308
Right, the warehouse said

17:22.310 --> 17:24.277
you signed for a package
at 12:40 p.m.

17:24.279 --> 17:26.311
And you headed straight back
to the city?

17:26.314 --> 17:28.146
No, no. I did some errands.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.649
Didn't get back till after 4:00.

17:29.651 --> 17:30.716
Got it.

17:30.718 --> 17:34.020
We ran a check
on your company rental car.

17:34.022 --> 17:35.821
A white sedan.

17:35.823 --> 17:37.924
Just like the one that picked up
Jenna from school.

17:39.092 --> 17:42.061
You never said anything to me
about a white sedan, Mark.

17:42.063 --> 17:44.063
I didn't do anything!

17:44.065 --> 17:45.998
Okay, for Jenna's
sake, I think we're

17:46.000 --> 17:49.568
gonna have to go over this one
more time from the top

17:49.570 --> 17:52.338
just to be safe.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.208
I told you there's nothing
to worry about.

17:56.210 --> 17:58.110
Defense did score points
when they showed

17:58.112 --> 18:02.281
that you had not read
the entire psychiatric history.

18:02.283 --> 18:03.716
I've testified dozens of times.

18:03.718 --> 18:07.153
Jurors don't expect you to
memorize a 3,000-page document.

18:07.155 --> 18:09.689
They may expect you to spend
more than 12 minutes

18:09.691 --> 18:11.290
with the defendant in order

18:11.292 --> 18:13.326
to render a credible opinion
about her condition.

18:13.328 --> 18:17.396
I can assure you my clinical
assessment is perfectly valid.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.767
I did read Ms. Del Rio's file.

18:21.769 --> 18:25.037
She has been in and out of
psychiatric hospitals for years.

18:25.039 --> 18:26.639
She assaulted
a nurse two years ago.

18:26.641 --> 18:27.940
You know what? I'm sorry.

18:27.942 --> 18:30.042
Are you a prosecutor
or a psychiatrist?

18:30.044 --> 18:31.477
I'm just saying, isn't it...?

18:31.479 --> 18:32.645
No, whatever
you're saying,

18:32.647 --> 18:34.647
Ms. Reagan,
has zero scientific value.

18:34.649 --> 18:37.016
I wrote the book on these
disorders, literally.

18:37.018 --> 18:40.820
You hired me to render
my professional opinion.

18:40.822 --> 18:44.724
If you wish to undermine
my conclusions and your case...

18:44.726 --> 18:46.559
go with God.

18:52.733 --> 18:55.001
I checked Wallace's EZ Pass.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.402
And?

18:56.404 --> 19:00.906
He went through the Whitestone
Bridge toll plaza at 1537 hours,

19:00.908 --> 19:04.143
20 minutes after
Jenna was abducted.

19:04.145 --> 19:07.146
Great, so unless he's driving
a rocket ship, he's not our guy.

19:07.148 --> 19:10.049
I'm gonna go grab us
some coffee.

19:10.051 --> 19:12.218
Ay, ay, ay.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.291
What's this?
My file on Allie.

19:19.293 --> 19:21.894
All my notes, personal
investigator reports.

19:21.896 --> 19:23.429
I thought it might help.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.900
I guess, at this point,
it can't hurt.

19:27.902 --> 19:31.137
I gather the investigation
isn't going well?

19:31.139 --> 19:32.505
We're looking into every angle.

19:32.507 --> 19:34.540
We're just coming up
empty so far.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.842
On the day Allie was taken,

19:36.844 --> 19:39.412
you told me, "The best weapon
in a case like this

19:39.414 --> 19:40.646
is never lose hope."

19:42.382 --> 19:44.383
I said that, didn't I?

19:44.385 --> 19:46.919
You did your best for me.

19:46.921 --> 19:48.387
And for Allie.

19:48.389 --> 19:51.857
And now these parents need you
to do the same for them.

19:53.727 --> 19:55.594
How do you do it, Joseph?

19:55.596 --> 19:58.064
You never lose hope.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.533
No matter how many years pass,

20:00.535 --> 20:02.935
you keep hoping everything's
gonna be okay.

20:02.937 --> 20:04.370
How do you do it?

20:04.372 --> 20:08.874
Because I don't have a choice.

20:08.876 --> 20:12.778
The alternative is accepting
that my life is over.

20:12.780 --> 20:17.750
That I've lost the one thing
I love most in this world.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.060
There's noise out there
the inspector general may call

20:28.062 --> 20:29.495
for hearings
on the Liaison Program.

20:29.497 --> 20:30.629
I know that.

20:30.631 --> 20:32.298
I'd love to help you out,

20:32.300 --> 20:34.433
but I've got one hand
tied behind my back.

20:34.435 --> 20:36.102
One will have to be sufficient.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.369
She's got to be bluffing.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.072
Don't bet on it.

20:40.074 --> 20:42.875
She can't dictate department
policy to the PC.

20:42.877 --> 20:44.176
That's the beauty of it.

20:44.178 --> 20:46.545
She's not dictating policy,
she's simply calling

20:46.547 --> 20:49.515
for transparency
in an existing program.

20:49.517 --> 20:51.016
Oh.

20:51.018 --> 20:55.054
One that has to be as
transparent as a rock to work.

20:55.056 --> 20:56.388
So let's counter.

20:56.390 --> 20:57.423
Let's not.

20:57.425 --> 20:58.858
You don't want
to make your case?

20:58.860 --> 21:02.194
To make a case you have to offer
details, strategies, viability.

21:02.196 --> 21:03.796
Not gonna.

21:03.798 --> 21:06.298
Well, you're not gonna pretend
it doesn't exist either.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.299
That ship sailed.

21:07.301 --> 21:09.969
I will not discuss the program,
Garrett!

21:09.971 --> 21:12.538
Not in a press release
and not before a committee.

21:12.540 --> 21:15.241
So how exactly do you expect me
to handle the press?

21:15.243 --> 21:17.309
With a polite but firm
"No comment."

21:17.311 --> 21:19.345
And what, wait for it
to go away?

21:19.347 --> 21:20.713
That's the plan?

21:20.715 --> 21:23.716
The inspector general can
investigate anything she wants.

21:23.718 --> 21:25.384
Doesn't mean
I have to start singing.

21:25.386 --> 21:26.986
What if she subpoenas you?

21:26.988 --> 21:29.321
I won't testify.

21:29.323 --> 21:31.056
There's a problem.

21:31.058 --> 21:34.093
You refuse a subpoena,
she can drag you into court.

21:34.095 --> 21:37.129
And if you still don't
cooperate, into a jail cell.

21:39.232 --> 21:41.534
I know that, too.

21:50.921 --> 21:52.855
Last time we were here,
you told us

21:52.857 --> 21:55.058
this is where Jenna came
to pick up her art.

21:55.060 --> 21:57.226
That's right. Jenna spent
a lot of time here.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.629
And you said there was
no one working in the room

21:59.631 --> 22:00.663
the day Jenna
disappeared?

22:00.665 --> 22:02.065
The art teacher
left early.

22:02.067 --> 22:04.500
The room was open
so the kids could stop in.

22:04.502 --> 22:05.868
Mrs. Galecki locked up.

22:05.870 --> 22:06.936
Who's Mrs. Galecki?

22:06.938 --> 22:08.404
One of our custodians.

22:08.406 --> 22:09.806
That's her
over there.

22:12.342 --> 22:14.677
Thanks.

22:14.679 --> 22:16.345
Ms. Galecki?

22:16.347 --> 22:18.714
Can I help you folks?

22:18.716 --> 22:19.849
Yeah. Police.

22:19.851 --> 22:20.850
Uh, we're here investigating

22:20.852 --> 22:22.085
the disappearance
of Jenna Wallace.

22:22.087 --> 22:23.686
Oh, that poor girl.

22:23.688 --> 22:24.754
Yes, ma'am.

22:24.756 --> 22:25.955
Did you see her

22:25.957 --> 22:27.323
when she came in here
that afternoon?

22:27.325 --> 22:28.324
Yeah.

22:28.326 --> 22:29.459
She was always
down here.

22:29.461 --> 22:31.994
She made this
beautiful mural...

22:31.996 --> 22:34.130
little trees
and a pond

22:34.132 --> 22:35.798
made out of shiny
blue paper.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.700
First place in
the art fair.

22:37.702 --> 22:38.701
Hmm.

22:38.703 --> 22:40.736
Do you know if she was
with anyone?

22:41.572 --> 22:42.805
No. She just

22:42.807 --> 22:46.375
grabbed her project
and headed out.

22:46.377 --> 22:47.877
Those are beautiful.

22:49.047 --> 22:50.780
I make these myself.

22:50.782 --> 22:53.382
I sell 'em at, uh, flea markets

22:53.384 --> 22:55.218
and craft fairs.

22:55.220 --> 22:56.719
Every little bit helps.

22:57.721 --> 22:59.922
You keep this.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.025
It's on the house.

23:04.695 --> 23:08.264
Thanks for your time.

23:11.034 --> 23:14.170
Arugula salad
from the salad guy?

23:14.172 --> 23:15.705
Mm-mm.

23:15.707 --> 23:17.507
Caesar's from
Carl's Cafe.

23:17.509 --> 23:19.742
It's nirvana.

23:19.744 --> 23:22.445
I got a call from
Malcolm Raskin's office.

23:22.447 --> 23:24.247
Let me guess.

23:24.249 --> 23:27.250
He didn't nominate me
as prosecutor of the year.

23:27.252 --> 23:28.317
That's an understatement.

23:28.319 --> 23:29.418
He said you
questioned

23:29.420 --> 23:31.787
his professional judgment.

23:31.789 --> 23:33.055
That's not true.

23:33.057 --> 23:34.390
I questioned his work ethic,

23:34.392 --> 23:36.926
and <i>then</i> I questioned
his professional judgment.

23:36.928 --> 23:39.195
Raskin's one of the
top guys in his field.

23:39.197 --> 23:40.163
Yeah.

23:40.165 --> 23:42.465
He made that abundantly clear.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.267
Okay, so Malcolm
has an ego.

23:44.269 --> 23:45.468
But he's a
great doctor

23:45.470 --> 23:46.702
and he's a
great witness.

23:46.704 --> 23:47.937
I've read
the transcript.

23:47.939 --> 23:50.039
His testimony can help
you win the case.

23:50.041 --> 23:52.008
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

23:52.010 --> 23:53.643
Raskin skimmed

23:53.645 --> 23:55.912
the defendant's medical history,

23:55.914 --> 23:58.314
and then he did a flyby
on the psych exam.

23:58.316 --> 24:00.216
You know as well as I do

24:00.218 --> 24:02.218
that defendants
have been crying crazy

24:02.220 --> 24:04.387
since the advent
of jurisprudence.

24:04.389 --> 24:05.321
That's true.

24:05.323 --> 24:06.589
But every once in a while,

24:06.591 --> 24:08.124
one of them
is telling the truth.

24:08.126 --> 24:09.659
I reviewed her history.

24:09.661 --> 24:12.461
Del Rio might be that defendant.

24:18.936 --> 24:20.336
Did you check the pork chops?

24:20.338 --> 24:22.572
Yeah, they need
a few more minutes.

24:24.942 --> 24:26.876
Ben seems like a nice guy.

24:26.878 --> 24:29.111
He is.

24:30.147 --> 24:31.714
You want me
to finish up that salad?

24:31.716 --> 24:33.883
Yeah, that would be great.

24:35.152 --> 24:36.719
How'd you do on the test?

24:36.721 --> 24:37.920
Pretty well,
I think.

24:39.189 --> 24:40.856
Studying with Ben really helped.

24:40.858 --> 24:42.525
We make a really great team.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.695
Well, that's... great.

24:45.697 --> 24:47.897
Have you known him a while?

24:49.032 --> 24:51.267
We have a bunch of friends
in common.

24:51.269 --> 24:53.309
This is the first class
we've actually had together.

24:54.705 --> 24:57.540
I guess I was a little surprised
the other night because...

24:57.542 --> 25:00.376
well, you know, you've never
really mentioned him before.

25:00.378 --> 25:02.044
I'm sure you've got
a lot of friends

25:02.046 --> 25:03.546
you've never mentioned
to me, right?

25:03.548 --> 25:05.915
Well, yeah...

25:07.184 --> 25:09.252
Oh, mashed potatoes are ready.

25:09.254 --> 25:11.988
So, then... you're saying
Ben is just a friend?

25:11.990 --> 25:14.690
Actually, I never said "just."

25:18.328 --> 25:20.496
So, Sean,

25:20.498 --> 25:22.531
you get to spend an overnight
in Philadelphia?

25:22.533 --> 25:23.499
Yeah.
Jimmy's dad's

25:23.501 --> 25:25.434
bringing me,
Terrence and Andrew

25:25.436 --> 25:27.069
to see the Knicks
play the Sixers.

25:27.071 --> 25:28.738
I hate the damn Sixers.

25:28.740 --> 25:30.573
His company has
an apartment down there.

25:30.575 --> 25:32.275
- Wow.
- I know, right?

25:32.277 --> 25:33.542
I never got to do
anything like that

25:33.544 --> 25:34.577
when I was
his age.

25:34.579 --> 25:35.578
Oh, Jack...

25:35.580 --> 25:36.979
Bitter, party of one...

25:36.981 --> 25:39.115
Actually, Sean,

25:39.117 --> 25:40.983
I don't think it's
gonna work out for you.

25:40.985 --> 25:43.386
Why not?
'Cause I haven't met Jimmy's dad.

25:44.454 --> 25:46.255
We talked about this when
we said he could go, Danny.

25:46.257 --> 25:47.690
I know we talked about it

25:47.692 --> 25:49.659
and I gave it
some more thought

25:49.661 --> 25:51.327
and I think I should take
him to the Garden myself.

25:51.329 --> 25:52.628
You can bring
your friends.

25:52.630 --> 25:54.030
- But that's not fair.
- Yeah.

25:54.032 --> 25:55.398
I mean, you said he could go.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.565
What's...

25:56.567 --> 25:59.068
Pop...

25:59.070 --> 26:00.569
Your dad's just trying
to take care of you, Sean.

26:00.571 --> 26:01.971
That's a parent's job.

26:01.973 --> 26:03.873
But at some point,
people have the right

26:03.875 --> 26:05.174
to have their
own life.

26:05.176 --> 26:07.310
Is this because of the case
you're working on?

26:07.312 --> 26:08.844
The girl who disappeared?
Sean...

26:08.846 --> 26:10.313
No. It's 'cause
I'm your father.

26:10.315 --> 26:11.447
Can you pass
the applesauce?

26:11.449 --> 26:13.115
Protecting people

26:13.117 --> 26:14.450
can be complicated, Sean.

26:14.452 --> 26:15.351
Sometimes people
don't appreciate

26:15.353 --> 26:17.019
the way you try
to keep them safe.

26:17.021 --> 26:18.988
Until something goes wrong.

26:18.990 --> 26:20.056
Exactly.

26:20.058 --> 26:22.425
But shouldn't people
have control

26:22.427 --> 26:24.193
over the way
they live their lives?

26:24.195 --> 26:25.461
We got a lot of freedom
in this country,

26:25.463 --> 26:26.729
but there's got
to be some rules,

26:26.731 --> 26:27.930
laws to protect us.

26:27.932 --> 26:29.532
Sometimes from ourselves.

26:29.534 --> 26:31.534
Maybe sometimes you
should let people

26:31.536 --> 26:32.768
take care of themselves.

26:32.770 --> 26:33.936
Yeah, well,

26:33.938 --> 26:35.738
not everyone can
do that, Nicky.

26:35.740 --> 26:37.173
There's a lot of bad
people out there.

26:37.175 --> 26:38.808
And they can do a lot of damage.

26:38.810 --> 26:40.309
Still, I see what
Nicky's saying.

26:40.311 --> 26:41.344
I mean, there's a fine line

26:41.346 --> 26:42.346
between protecting people

26:42.347 --> 26:43.779
and going
too far...

26:43.781 --> 26:44.847
trampling on their rights.

26:44.849 --> 26:46.415
I'm definitely feeling trampled.

26:48.453 --> 26:49.985
The people
with the responsibility

26:49.987 --> 26:51.787
need to use it
as wisely as they can.

26:51.789 --> 26:54.957
And the people being protected
need to realize

26:54.959 --> 26:58.160
that being safe
can cost you something.

26:58.162 --> 27:01.530
But it beats the hell
out of the alternative.

27:07.337 --> 27:08.704
I assume we're not here

27:08.706 --> 27:10.473
to take in a matinee.

27:10.475 --> 27:12.908
This is for your ears only.

27:12.910 --> 27:16.145
Five months ago
an Islamist terror cell--

27:16.147 --> 27:17.646
same one responsible

27:17.648 --> 27:19.648
for the bombing in London
the other day--

27:19.650 --> 27:22.151
had plans to do
some damage here.

27:22.153 --> 27:24.387
What happened?

27:24.389 --> 27:25.354
On a tip,

27:25.356 --> 27:27.223
we located the bomb components

27:27.225 --> 27:29.024
in a locker at Penn Station.

27:30.660 --> 27:31.727
That tip

27:31.729 --> 27:34.163
was provided
by one of my officers

27:34.165 --> 27:36.031
in the International
Liaison Program.

27:36.033 --> 27:38.734
FBI didn't have
the intel,

27:38.736 --> 27:41.137
or Interpol, or the CIA.

27:41.139 --> 27:42.371
Only we did.

27:42.373 --> 27:44.273
Listen, I'm just trying to...

27:44.275 --> 27:47.243
I know what you're trying to do.

27:47.245 --> 27:49.845
But in this instance,
it's a dead wrong reading

27:49.847 --> 27:51.480
of the public's right to know.

27:51.482 --> 27:53.048
Well, you're out
of bounds with that.

27:53.050 --> 27:54.550
You're not the judge here.

27:54.552 --> 27:56.152
No, I'm not.

27:56.154 --> 27:58.454
And neither are you.

27:58.456 --> 28:02.458
The judgment comes
if there's something we miss

28:02.460 --> 28:04.560
and innocent people die.

28:07.864 --> 28:09.331
I wish it were
that simple.

28:09.333 --> 28:10.633
It is.
It is not.

28:10.635 --> 28:13.402
Kelly, this can't
be effectively run

28:13.404 --> 28:15.938
with backseat drivers
and armchair quarterbacks.

28:15.940 --> 28:17.006
It just can't.

28:17.008 --> 28:18.441
That's not what I'm after.

28:18.443 --> 28:20.876
Walks like it, talks like it.

28:20.878 --> 28:22.011
After the incident in London,

28:22.013 --> 28:24.246
all eyes are on your ILP.

28:24.248 --> 28:26.348
This is the Snowden era.

28:26.350 --> 28:27.583
Hell, even the NSA

28:27.585 --> 28:29.885
let <i>60 Minutes</i>
in their front door.

28:29.887 --> 28:32.087
Maybe, but they didn't
let 'em in the kitchen

28:32.089 --> 28:33.856
where the sausage is made.

28:36.159 --> 28:37.493
You've got a job to do.

28:37.495 --> 28:40.062
You do it well
and I respect that.

28:40.064 --> 28:42.164
But I've got a job, too.

28:42.166 --> 28:44.800
I'm charged with
monitoring the NYPD

28:44.802 --> 28:46.268
and making sure
they're operating

28:46.270 --> 28:47.570
in the public interest.

28:47.572 --> 28:49.338
The public interest
would not be served

28:49.340 --> 28:51.040
by killing the ILP.

28:51.042 --> 28:53.242
And open hearings
would do just that.

28:53.244 --> 28:55.644
You can push this only so far

28:55.646 --> 28:58.681
until anyone in their right mind
is gonna think,

28:58.683 --> 29:00.583
"What the hell are they hiding?"

29:28.064 --> 29:29.899
Joseph Scott's file?

29:29.901 --> 29:30.866
Yeah.

29:30.868 --> 29:32.001
Figured maybe
I could find

29:32.003 --> 29:33.269
something that
we could use.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.603
We've checked out everyone

29:34.605 --> 29:35.838
who works at that school.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.939
They're all clean.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.974
Yeah. We're
missing something.

29:41.144 --> 29:42.645
You're just torturing yourself

29:42.647 --> 29:44.313
'cause you couldn't
find Allie Scott

29:44.315 --> 29:45.981
and now you think
it's happening again.

29:45.983 --> 29:47.716
I'm doing my job, okay?

29:55.559 --> 29:58.861
My son was
in the hospital before.

29:58.863 --> 30:01.063
We didn't know
if he was gonna make it.

30:02.299 --> 30:03.732
Something like
that happens...

30:03.734 --> 30:08.170
there's nothing else in
the world that feels that way.

30:08.172 --> 30:10.005
It's like your heart is being
ripped out of your chest.

30:10.007 --> 30:12.841
Nothing makes sense.

30:12.843 --> 30:15.277
That's what Joseph Scott
feels like every day.

30:15.279 --> 30:17.446
And you don't want the Wallaces

30:17.448 --> 30:18.814
to end up the same.

30:18.816 --> 30:19.982
No, I don't.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.084
Well, did you find
anything in the file?

30:22.086 --> 30:25.087
The girls have
a couple things in common.

30:25.089 --> 30:27.189
They both sang
in the school choir,

30:27.191 --> 30:28.524
they both...

30:28.526 --> 30:30.659
won prizes in the art fair.

30:31.795 --> 30:34.596
Look at that.

30:34.598 --> 30:36.265
The flower.

30:36.267 --> 30:39.401
Just like the one
the custodian gave you.

30:41.137 --> 30:43.272
Look.

30:44.140 --> 30:45.975
It looks
the same.

30:48.478 --> 30:51.480
That custodian, Ms. Galecki...

30:51.482 --> 30:52.781
she was the last one

30:52.783 --> 30:55.017
that saw Allie at the school
seven years ago.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.655
Custodian's office is right
across from the art class

30:59.657 --> 31:01.957
where Jenna went back in
before she was abducted.

31:01.959 --> 31:05.794
So Galecki saw Jenna
every day, too.

31:07.063 --> 31:08.964
It's still kind of a leap.

31:08.966 --> 31:10.499
What else do we got?

31:10.501 --> 31:12.368
Let's take a ride.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.303
Come on.

31:17.407 --> 31:18.974
Thank you for coming, Doctor.

31:18.976 --> 31:19.942
I hope this
won't take long.

31:19.944 --> 31:21.443
I have patients
this afternoon.

31:21.445 --> 31:22.644
I spoke with
Amanda Harris.

31:22.646 --> 31:25.314
I understand you're
quite upset with me.

31:25.316 --> 31:29.585
Let's just say I accept
your apology and move on.

31:29.587 --> 31:31.453
This is not an apology.

31:31.455 --> 31:32.287
It's quite the contrary.

31:32.289 --> 31:34.890
I asked two
psychiatrists,

31:34.892 --> 31:37.226
who have testified
for this office in the past,

31:37.228 --> 31:39.828
to review Ms. Del Rio's file
and to meet with her.

31:39.830 --> 31:42.998
Both concluded that
her bipolar illness

31:43.000 --> 31:44.933
was responsible
for the incident,

31:44.935 --> 31:47.936
directly contradicting
your testimony.

31:47.938 --> 31:49.705
This is outrageous.
I agree.

31:49.707 --> 31:51.840
An expert witness

31:51.842 --> 31:54.510
more interested
in satisfying his ego

31:54.512 --> 31:57.646
than telling the truth
is outrageous.

31:58.481 --> 31:59.848
I don't have to take this.

31:59.850 --> 32:02.818
I kept asking myself,
"I wonder why is he doing this?"

32:02.820 --> 32:05.754
I mean, you clearly
do not need the money.

32:05.756 --> 32:08.123
And then it
occurred to me.

32:08.125 --> 32:09.425
It's a game for you.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.126
You like to walk in

32:11.128 --> 32:13.262
and have everyone see
how smart you are.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.664
To have the jury hang
on every word.

32:15.666 --> 32:17.833
My credentials speak
for themselves.

32:17.835 --> 32:20.069
If you don't appreciate
my expertise,

32:20.071 --> 32:22.171
there are scores
of your colleagues who will.

32:22.173 --> 32:23.672
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.

32:23.674 --> 32:26.408
I intend to get justice
in this case.

32:26.410 --> 32:29.578
The fact that I had to go
around my own expert witness

32:29.580 --> 32:31.146
to do so will be known

32:31.148 --> 32:33.916
by every prosecutor
in this building.

32:35.752 --> 32:37.953
I would not wait by the phone.

32:42.526 --> 32:45.561
Ms. Galecki, it's
Detective Reagan.

32:45.563 --> 32:47.429
Can you open the door, please?

32:51.668 --> 32:53.368
Hello, Detectives.
Ma'am.

32:53.370 --> 32:55.070
Is everything all right?

32:55.072 --> 32:56.772
We need to ask you
some questions.

32:56.774 --> 32:58.140
Can we step inside, please?

32:58.142 --> 33:00.476
Well, I'm sorry.
Is it okay if we talk out here?

33:00.478 --> 33:02.010
My husband isn't well.

33:02.012 --> 33:03.378
With all due respect,

33:03.380 --> 33:04.880
we're dealing
with a missing child, ma'am.

33:04.882 --> 33:07.616
We'll get a warrant to search
the place if we need to.

33:07.618 --> 33:09.351
No need to do that.

33:09.353 --> 33:10.719
Come in.

33:19.529 --> 33:21.263
How can I help you?

33:21.265 --> 33:23.031
Where's your husband, ma'am?

33:23.033 --> 33:25.467
He's sleeping upstairs.

33:25.469 --> 33:27.102
Upstairs, huh?

33:27.104 --> 33:29.171
Okay.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.573
You working
on your flowers today, ma'am?

33:31.575 --> 33:33.342
But, Detective,
where are you going?

33:33.344 --> 33:35.511
Just looking around, ma'am.

33:40.783 --> 33:42.784
That the basement?

33:42.786 --> 33:44.820
Yes.
What's down there?

33:44.822 --> 33:47.089
Just storage and supplies.

33:47.091 --> 33:49.391
My husband has a key.

33:49.393 --> 33:50.993
Step aside, ma'am.

33:52.328 --> 33:54.530
Thank you.

33:59.235 --> 34:00.836
Hello?

34:00.838 --> 34:03.272
Police.
Anyone down there?

34:05.808 --> 34:06.975
Hello!

34:10.346 --> 34:13.047
Help me, please!

34:13.050 --> 34:14.683
Grab her.

34:14.685 --> 34:17.119
Ma'am, I need you
to stay right here.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.453
Don't move.

34:20.924 --> 34:22.291
Hello?

34:29.399 --> 34:32.201
Jenna?

34:44.313 --> 34:46.715
Get your damn hands off her
right now.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.784
She's okay.
Let her go.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.752
Everything is okay.
Shut your mouth

34:50.754 --> 34:52.654
and let her go now.

34:54.623 --> 34:56.425
Stay right here.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.927
I'm Detective Reagan;
I'm gonna get you home safe now.

34:58.929 --> 35:00.028
I got her!

35:00.030 --> 35:02.231
Put your hands
behind your back, please.

35:03.633 --> 35:05.667
On the ground, you.
Hey, take it easy.

35:05.669 --> 35:07.169
Shut your mouth
and get on the ground.

35:07.171 --> 35:09.204
We never hurt her.
Now!

35:16.346 --> 35:17.779
Detective Reagan?

35:17.781 --> 35:19.681
It's okay, sweetie. I'll get you
out of here in a second.

35:19.683 --> 35:21.750
Detective Reagan?

35:28.358 --> 35:31.059
Not guilty by
reason of insanity.

35:31.061 --> 35:32.527
Are you sure?

35:32.529 --> 35:33.829
Del Rio will be

35:33.831 --> 35:36.565
committed to a secure
psychiatric facility

35:36.567 --> 35:38.600
where she can get the help
that she needs.

35:38.602 --> 35:40.135
It hasn't helped so far.

35:40.137 --> 35:43.505
If you let this go to jury
on the murder charge

35:43.507 --> 35:45.941
with Malcolm's testimony,
you would probably win.

35:45.943 --> 35:48.577
It depends on your definition
of winning.

35:48.579 --> 35:51.546
It's where she belongs, Amanda.

36:00.623 --> 36:02.491
Thank you.

36:05.762 --> 36:08.597
I'm hearing we can expect a
subpoena by the end of the week.

36:08.599 --> 36:11.133
I guess I could always
leave town.

36:11.135 --> 36:13.001
I'd buy you a fake mustache
and glasses,

36:13.003 --> 36:14.303
but you've got that covered.

36:15.605 --> 36:17.673
Remind me again
why I keep you around.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.309
Force of habit?

36:20.311 --> 36:21.943
The inspector general

36:21.945 --> 36:23.145
is here.

36:24.514 --> 36:26.448
Let's have her.

36:26.450 --> 36:29.284
You have to admire a woman
who serves her own subpoenas.

36:33.256 --> 36:34.990
What was that look?

36:34.992 --> 36:36.258
I didn't give you a look.

36:36.260 --> 36:37.592
Yeah, you did.

36:37.594 --> 36:39.027
It's like the look
the first wife

36:39.029 --> 36:41.963
gives the second wife at
the kid's graduation ceremony.

36:41.965 --> 36:44.199
Interloper.

36:44.201 --> 36:46.168
Exactly.

36:46.170 --> 36:48.270
I've got work to do.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.379
You're going to refuse
to testify.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.514
Yes.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.884
Do you really believe

37:02.886 --> 37:05.487
that I want to endanger
this city?

37:05.489 --> 37:08.223
I never said that.

37:08.225 --> 37:11.126
But there is an immutable truth

37:11.128 --> 37:12.928
about intelligence.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.663
It's a lot less valuable

37:14.665 --> 37:16.798
if your enemies know
you have it.

37:20.303 --> 37:23.839
Kelly, I won't discuss
the program publicly.

37:27.577 --> 37:29.878
Well, maybe you won't have to.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.047
I'd like to propose
monthly briefings

37:32.049 --> 37:33.648
with the city councilman

37:33.650 --> 37:35.684
who oversees the NYPD.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.019
That's not gonna happen.

37:38.021 --> 37:41.123
There has to be an individual

37:41.125 --> 37:45.093
outside the department
with access to this program.

37:47.630 --> 37:50.265
That would be you.

37:51.667 --> 37:53.635
Well...

37:53.637 --> 37:55.303
I can't very well
go back to them

37:55.305 --> 37:57.472
and just nominate myself.

37:57.474 --> 38:00.142
It is the only offer
on the table.

38:07.884 --> 38:09.451
I can't promise anything.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.286
Didn't ask you to.

38:15.525 --> 38:17.392
I've got a question.

38:21.164 --> 38:23.031
Would you really put me in jail?

38:23.033 --> 38:24.900
Yes.

38:26.269 --> 38:29.204
But with a heavy heart.

38:37.447 --> 38:39.548
Good night, Ms. Reagan.

38:39.550 --> 38:42.117
Bye, Ben.

38:43.986 --> 38:45.520
So, I'll see you tomorrow.

38:45.522 --> 38:47.222
See you.

39:06.409 --> 39:08.310
Just ask me, Mom.

39:09.111 --> 39:11.179
What?

39:11.181 --> 39:13.815
Ask me if I'm having sex
with Ben.

39:15.651 --> 39:17.619
Are you?

39:19.322 --> 39:20.822
No.

39:22.692 --> 39:24.359
But we have talked about it.

39:26.162 --> 39:27.796
Oh?

39:29.565 --> 39:33.101
Come on, Mom,
you can't really be surprised.

39:33.103 --> 39:35.303
Most of my friends
have already done it.

39:35.305 --> 39:40.008
That is not a good enough reason
to have sex for the first time.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.010
Do you love him?

39:42.012 --> 39:44.179
I don't know.

39:46.315 --> 39:48.517
I mean, he's a really great guy,

39:48.519 --> 39:51.786
and I really care about him.

39:54.790 --> 39:56.725
And I feel like I'm ready.

39:58.494 --> 40:01.062
Go ahead, let me have it.

40:06.602 --> 40:08.803
Okay.

40:09.906 --> 40:12.507
Well, I am sorry
to disappoint you,

40:12.509 --> 40:16.411
but I am not going
to yell and scream.

40:18.247 --> 40:20.715
Do I wish that you would wait

40:20.717 --> 40:22.651
until you were sure
if you were in love?

40:22.653 --> 40:24.486
Yes.

40:24.488 --> 40:28.223
But we both know
that's not up to me.

40:29.559 --> 40:31.159
You are

40:31.161 --> 40:33.528
a beautiful, smart young woman

40:33.530 --> 40:36.698
with good judgment.

40:36.700 --> 40:40.035
When the time is right,
you will...

40:40.037 --> 40:44.072
make the right decision.

40:44.074 --> 40:47.509
And if you need to talk
about anything, I am here.

40:51.147 --> 40:53.048
Thank you.

40:54.650 --> 40:56.685
Now, having said that,

40:56.687 --> 40:58.219
this is still my house,

40:58.221 --> 40:59.454
which means
there are boundaries.

40:59.456 --> 41:01.056
I do not want you two
in that bedroom,

41:01.058 --> 41:04.693
and let's keep
the PDA down to a minimum.

41:04.695 --> 41:06.895
Deal?

41:08.731 --> 41:10.031
Deal.

41:10.033 --> 41:12.500
Deal.

41:13.836 --> 41:16.037
Did you and Grandma
ever have this conversation?

41:17.840 --> 41:19.774
Yes.

41:19.776 --> 41:23.345
The day before I was going
to marry your father,

41:23.347 --> 41:25.080
and...

41:25.082 --> 41:27.182
I didn't have the heart
to tell her

41:27.184 --> 41:29.985
that she was a little late.

41:41.063 --> 41:43.565
Detective?

41:43.567 --> 41:45.300
Hey, Joseph,
thanks for coming down.

41:45.302 --> 41:47.502
I heard you found Jenna Wallace.

41:47.504 --> 41:50.572
Uh, yeah, thanks to you.

41:52.008 --> 41:53.575
I'm happy for them.

41:53.577 --> 41:56.044
They're grateful to you
for all you did.

41:56.046 --> 41:59.414
There's someone else
who wants to thank you, too,

41:59.416 --> 42:01.182
right over there.

42:06.322 --> 42:08.356
Daddy?

42:11.127 --> 42:13.561
Daddy?

42:15.297 --> 42:16.765
Allie.

42:26.208 --> 42:27.609
Did they...?

42:27.611 --> 42:29.411
No.

42:29.413 --> 42:31.312
She said they never touched her.
