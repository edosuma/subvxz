02:40.786 --> 02:42.072
So, we're in E.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.991
- The tonic.
- No, E.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.242
All right, E.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.496
So, four bars of that,
you know the sort of thing,

02:48.710 --> 02:50.952
"Woke up this morning,
head felt so bad,"

02:51.046 --> 02:52.036
then into A.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.120
The sub-dominant.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.794
"Woke up this morning,
head felt so bad."

02:55.884 --> 02:57.500
Same thing,
different chord, see.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.381
Hmm. Tricky.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.461
Then back to E again...

03:02.641 --> 03:06.806
Then, this is the emotional punch,
it reaches right up to B.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.849
Ah. The dominant.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.430
And he says
something like,

03:10.524 --> 03:13.267
"Gonna tell that two-timin' woman,"
back through A,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.773
you know,
"she's driving me mad"

03:15.862 --> 03:18.605
and then this lovely little thing,
the turnaround on B seventh...

03:19.032 --> 03:20.694
Minor seventh
might be better.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.867
And that
brings you back to E.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.326
- And am I?
- What?

03:24.413 --> 03:25.494
Driving you mad.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.663
Well, actually, yes.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.296
<i>The Prime Minister,
Sir Harold Macmillan,</i>

03:39.386 --> 03:41.093
<i>has been holding talks
in Washington</i>

03:41.179 --> 03:44.013
<i>with the United States
president, Mr. John Kennedy.</i>

03:44.099 --> 03:47.968
<i>The principal subject of their discussion
was a proposed test ban treaty...</i>

03:54.276 --> 03:56.313
Not tonight. Thank you.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.565
Perfect.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.566
Now listen!

04:09.583 --> 04:11.119
Nice microtones...

04:11.793 --> 04:14.035
A load of sick bloody cats.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.788
I'd rather have your lot.

04:22.471 --> 04:26.306
I really don't mind,
if you want that Hank person.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.507
Or is it Elvis?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.101
Chuck Berry.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.435
It's all right, he's gone,
he's had it.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.982
Honestly, you can,
I think it's...

04:37.402 --> 04:39.189
He's quite...

04:41.198 --> 04:44.282
- Quite what?
- Well, sort of merry.

04:44.659 --> 04:45.866
Chuck Berry?

04:47.329 --> 04:48.365
What else?

04:48.872 --> 04:51.114
And, you know, bouncy.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.666
Do you know,

04:54.753 --> 04:57.962
I think you must be the squarest
person in all of western civilization.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.079
But you love me.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.673
Therefore, I love you.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.308
You know, Florence,
it was beautiful.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.272
Nothing went wrong!

05:17.400 --> 05:19.016
Even my mother behaved herself.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.150
Do you think she knew
what was happening?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.908
I don't know.
Perhaps she did.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.406
Poor Edward...

05:44.302 --> 05:46.168
Steady.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.222
Get it.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.762
Bastard.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.226
Now, give it here.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.452
Listen, I've decided.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.030
If we have a girl,
she'll be called Chloe.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.618
Chloe.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.457
Yes, it's beautiful.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.596
Damn. Ignore it.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.313
You ought to look.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.534
Evening, sir.
Dinner what you ordered.

06:52.621 --> 06:53.702
Not this early...

06:59.836 --> 07:01.043
Ma'am.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.711
- Careful.
- Sir.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.468
Uh, no, perhaps...

07:14.517 --> 07:15.849
- The windows closed a bit.
- Sir.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.510
- Not that much.
- Oh, right you are.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.095
A bit more.
Yeah, that's it. Thank you.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.305
- And push the curtains back.
- Certainly, sir.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.851
Just push the curtain...

07:23.276 --> 07:25.017
- Facing each other.
- Yes, sir.

07:25.904 --> 07:26.985
- The chairs.
- Ah.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.958
It's very good actually.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.630
Thank you
very much, sir.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.315
Are you...

08:12.033 --> 08:13.615
Are you going to stand there
the whole time?

08:13.952 --> 08:16.740
Uh, we do the silver service
on the beef, sir,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.789
and then we all retire.

08:19.916 --> 08:20.997
Oh.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.787
I love you.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.083
And I...

08:32.679 --> 08:33.965
Thank you.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.270
You ever feel the need
for anything, sir,

08:44.107 --> 08:45.814
just, uh, pull
on the string. Hard.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.313
And have
a very nice one, sir.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.529
Uh, yes.

08:52.824 --> 08:53.940
Good night.

08:58.747 --> 08:59.908
Oh.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.077
Yes.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.701
Sorry.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.787
Thank you.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.926
Girls. Girls, can you come down?
I need your help.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.253
Oh, God...

09:59.015 --> 10:00.597
In the garden, please.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.099
- Marjorie.
- She was up there.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.266
- She could hear me.
- Harriet.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.262
- That's all right.
- Come on, Harriet, Dad wants us.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.604
In the garden, quickly.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.852
She could understand me.
She was listening to me.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.731
I know, I know. But she would
also listen to you with your clothes on.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.562
No, but she needs
the connection.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.194
The nights are shorter now,
so she doesn't sleep so much.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.570
But she won't
come down.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.988
No. She'll never
come down.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.158
We're quite safe.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.248
Marjorie Mayhew.
You'll get me thrown in prison.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.333
Girls, help Mum
get dressed.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.705
Come on, Mum.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.837
Do you know, as you walk
that way along the beach,

11:14.007 --> 11:15.339
the stones get bigger.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.040
Yes?

11:17.427 --> 11:23.674
Well, over thousands of years storms
have sort of graded the pebbles.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.260
So, when local fishermen
come ashore at night

11:27.353 --> 11:28.969
they can tell exactly
where they are.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.476
That's the story, anyway.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.442
We could go back out there.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.396
- You don't mean now.
- Why not?

11:38.823 --> 11:40.439
Take the wine,
some fruit.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.274
It won't get dark
for a long time.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.155
Yes, but I'm not sure we
could just leave all this...

11:44.329 --> 11:46.571
I'm not awfully hungry
after that lunch.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.405
Yes, but Flo, they've gone to a
lot of trouble. We can't just...

11:48.499 --> 11:51.037
I know, but it looks
so beautiful out there...

11:51.878 --> 11:53.335
But we're here...

11:54.923 --> 11:56.255
In here...

11:57.926 --> 11:59.417
And you're so beautiful.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.921
I keep thinking
how beautiful you are, and...

12:01.012 --> 12:02.924
I suppose you're right.
I mean, about...

12:03.014 --> 12:04.505
Oh, God.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.178
Look, sorry. I...
Am I being a bully?

12:07.769 --> 12:09.431
Of course, you're not.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.764
You know what,

12:14.442 --> 12:16.980
I could get them to bring back
that plate warmer thingy.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.356
And we could go out
for as long as you like.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.812
No, I'm just being silly.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.148
Honestly, Edward, I don't think I
could bear to have them back in here.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.358
It won't take a minute.
It's no trouble at all...

12:23.493 --> 12:24.609
Edward, please, no!

12:28.998 --> 12:30.159
God...

12:31.626 --> 12:32.787
We're having
our first row.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.204
- Florence, we're not.
- We are. Because I'm being selfish.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.338
Honestly, we're not.
You're not being selfish.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.585
We are, we are.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.542
And it's all
my stupid fault.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.887
And what are they saying,
your Aldermaston lot,

12:48.977 --> 12:51.890
about this wonderful wall
in Berlin last month?

12:51.980 --> 12:53.721
Bit awkward for the lefties,
isn't it?

12:53.815 --> 12:55.556
We hate it. Everyone hates it.

12:55.692 --> 12:59.527
An entire country turned into a prison camp,
with the Soviet's blessing.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.898
A proud day for socialism.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.280
- How was school?
- A million Russian troops

13:03.408 --> 13:04.740
- spread along the border.
- All right.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.237
What do you think
prevents them

13:06.327 --> 13:08.569
from sending their tanks
across the north German plain?

13:08.663 --> 13:09.744
Common sense,
I should think.

13:09.872 --> 13:14.082
Common sense? Nonsense!
It's the bomb, the one you want to ban.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.628
Communism, as it proudly proclaims,
is an expansionist creed.

13:18.673 --> 13:22.041
It's our nuclear bombs that deter them.
It's as simple as that, my dear.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.501
We need a deterrent.

13:23.594 --> 13:27.929
Do you remember a couple of months ago I
said I met this chap at a CND meeting?

13:28.433 --> 13:30.425
I've asked him round
tomorrow for tea.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.510
- Chap?
- Is he a beatnik?

13:32.603 --> 13:33.593
No.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.055
- Beard and sandals?
- No.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.061
- What does he do?
- He's a beatnik.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.189
Shut up. He's like me,
just finished his degree.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.236
- What college?
- UCL.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.780
But darling, that's London.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.318
For the sons of tradesmen.
Florence!

13:48.411 --> 13:50.118
They produce
some pretty decent engineers.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.779
Well, exactly.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.199
What does his father do?

13:56.294 --> 13:58.001
You mean, is he working class
or one of us?

13:58.129 --> 14:00.496
Yes. I think that's
more or less what I mean.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.416
His dad's headmaster of a
primary school in Henley.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.425
And what does your young man
intend doing with himself?

14:12.518 --> 14:14.601
I haven't researched
his prospects.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.105
I haven't worked out his
precise socioeconomic status.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.400
I haven't arranged to marry him.
I've asked him for tea. For tea.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.357
Jolly good.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.114
Pass the new green...
What are we calling them?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.452
Mangetout.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.961
I would say it was the day I
bought my first railway ticket.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.038
I must have been 13.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.000
When I joined the queue
my heart was thumping.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.919
I'd rehearsed my lines in the bedroom,
the night before,

14:49.097 --> 14:51.464
like a big speech
in a Shakespeare play.

14:52.600 --> 14:57.470
And then it was my turn and I
said in a tiny shaking voice,

14:57.563 --> 14:59.896
"May I please have
a half single to London?"

15:01.067 --> 15:02.433
Not a single mistake!

15:04.445 --> 15:07.108
Then I was walking towards the
barrier with the ticket in my hand

15:07.198 --> 15:09.064
and I thought, "This is it.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.114
"I've done it, I've joined the big world,
I'm a grown-up!"

15:15.081 --> 15:16.197
Well, mine...

15:17.417 --> 15:21.127
It was the time when I learned
what really happened to my mum.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.335
So now we have Holman
Hunt on loan to New York,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.213
Burne Jones on loan
to Edinburgh,

15:28.302 --> 15:31.761
so I decided not to move the
Titians or Rubens, as requested.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.888
But to bring up from store
two glorious Uccellos...

15:35.977 --> 15:39.141
- I don't know Uccello.
- Oh, darling! Glorious.

15:39.230 --> 15:42.723
Uh, a fifteenth-century
pioneer of perspective,

15:42.817 --> 15:44.774
- a mathematician in fact...
- Better stand back a bit.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.727
And wonderful at animals.

15:46.821 --> 15:50.030
Birds. Landscape.
Trees in their natural color.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.028
You, Lionel, you especially
would love it...

16:03.421 --> 16:05.413
<i>I'd grown up
with the way she was.</i>

16:05.756 --> 16:07.213
<i>Taken her for granted.</i>

16:07.675 --> 16:08.882
<i>We all did.</i>

16:11.721 --> 16:14.680
<i>But when he used
this horrible phrase,</i>

16:16.517 --> 16:18.099
<i>everything changed.</i>

16:20.855 --> 16:22.096
Brain-damaged.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.517
Suddenly I saw her
the way other people did.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.278
That must have been awful.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.277
You're always
very kind to her.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.911
My mother just pretends
to be brain-damaged.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.282
Funny thing, it was
a sort of release.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.544
I felt this...

16:46.964 --> 16:50.503
This space opening up
around me.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.675
She was brain-damaged,
and I wasn't.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.014
I wasn't her,

16:58.643 --> 17:00.635
I wasn't my family,
I was me.

17:03.898 --> 17:09.109
I felt kind of excited,
like my life had just begun.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.655
Ed! Second post.
Looks like the one!

17:19.579 --> 17:20.820
Big moment, eh?

17:21.665 --> 17:23.123
Uh, Terry,
I think I'll...

17:24.292 --> 17:26.660
Tell me tomorrow.
And good luck.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.546
I don't believe it.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.348
Mum.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.428
Mum, listen.

17:46.857 --> 17:47.847
Are you listening?

17:47.942 --> 17:50.355
This isn't how she looks now.
This is the future.

17:50.444 --> 17:54.313
A new thing. A special camera that
tells you how she'll look one day.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.273
This is important.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.154
Put that down
for a moment.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.695
Listen to me.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.238
I got a first, Mum.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.540
A first class degree.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.126
That's right, son.
I saw you. I was watching.

18:09.297 --> 18:12.916
Now you tell me.
Yellow, like this has two things.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.250
A meaning and a number.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.794
Now I know the number...

18:19.181 --> 18:20.797
Seven, Mum.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.303
Seven.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.972
I can't remember
the meaning.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.020
- Anne?
- Up here.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.939
- Harriet?
- What?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.995
Anne, Harriet,
I got a first.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.585
- Is that good?
- It's the best.

18:50.963 --> 18:51.999
Dad'll be happy then.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.751
- When's he back?
- 8:00.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.087
- 9:00.
- 9:00.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.670
You two should be outside.
It's beautiful.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.097
- Too hot.
- Too boring.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.853
<i>Hello. Is Toby there?</i>

19:13.527 --> 19:14.859
<i>Uh, when are you
expecting him?</i>

19:15.821 --> 19:16.902
<i>Oh.</i>

19:17.865 --> 19:19.481
<i>Mrs. Davenport?</i>

19:19.575 --> 19:21.988
<i>Edward Mayhew,
a university friend of Henry's.</i>

19:22.078 --> 19:23.068
<i>Is he there?</i>

19:25.081 --> 19:26.071
Finland?

20:26.350 --> 20:28.637
Just consider it
for a moment, Florence.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.768
If it fell on St. Giles,
the crater would be half a mile across,

20:32.857 --> 20:33.847
a hundred feet deep,

20:33.941 --> 20:36.558
and the city would be
uninhabitable for a thousand years

20:36.652 --> 20:38.314
because the radioactivity...

20:38.404 --> 20:39.520
Hello.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.692
Hello.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.241
Would you like one?

20:45.870 --> 20:48.613
It's all about a hydrogen
bomb landing on Oxford.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.830
Can't think
of anything better.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.744
Do you mind
if I tell you something?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.213
- I've got to tell someone.
- Tell me.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.963
I say, do we know you?

21:03.220 --> 21:06.008
I just heard, I got a first

21:06.974 --> 21:08.090
in history.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.425
That's fantastic.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.010
Let's get on with handing these out,
shall we?

21:13.564 --> 21:14.645
All right.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.977
So, it's a series
of history books,

21:20.446 --> 21:22.233
not about the great men,

21:22.323 --> 21:25.066
but about the minor
figures at their side,

21:25.868 --> 21:28.326
the bit-part players
who fade away.

21:28.412 --> 21:32.782
Like the man who rode non-stop
from London to Edinburgh

21:32.875 --> 21:35.583
to tell the king of Scotland
that Elizabeth was dead

21:35.669 --> 21:37.581
and he was now
the king of England.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.921
I think that's a brilliant idea.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.834
I thought everything would be clear
as soon as my result came through.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.044
But it isn't.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.258
I'm still just
hanging around.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.384
Like me.

21:49.934 --> 21:54.269
I could play in this awful dance
orchestra in a hotel near Slough.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.938
But what I really want
is to work with my quartet.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.602
What's that?

21:59.735 --> 22:02.318
Two violins,
viola, cello.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.270
We're called
the Ennismore Quartet.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.657
Then Daddy would have to support me,
and he and I don't exactly...

22:07.743 --> 22:08.984
What did you get?

22:09.870 --> 22:10.860
What?

22:11.622 --> 22:13.033
In your music degree.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.704
Well, actually,
same as you.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.003
To Miss Florence...

22:28.305 --> 22:29.341
Uh...

22:29.515 --> 22:30.505
Ponting.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.766
To Miss Florence Ponting.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.395
In acknowledgment
of your fine achievement.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.057
Well done.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.314
Thank you.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.508
Florence, look...

23:18.772 --> 23:19.888
I love you.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.519
And you're so...

23:27.031 --> 23:28.067
Uh...

23:39.043 --> 23:40.750
I mean,
I need to kiss you.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.355
I love you, too.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.319
And I...

24:13.911 --> 24:14.901
I...

24:16.455 --> 24:17.662
What is it, darling?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.621
Nothing.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.275
Edward...

24:48.821 --> 24:50.278
- What?
- Sorry.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.114
What is it?

24:54.910 --> 24:55.991
Well...

24:56.912 --> 24:58.119
I just thought...

24:59.373 --> 25:04.368
You know, it isn't awfully
comfortable here when we could...

25:08.382 --> 25:09.748
Oh, you... you mean...

25:11.844 --> 25:15.428
Yes, of course, let's...

25:19.143 --> 25:20.429
Come on then.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.923
If I just take
this off then...

26:01.268 --> 26:04.261
Well, we could go
on the bed and...

26:07.483 --> 26:08.473
Well...

26:09.359 --> 26:13.854
Then, I think I'll...
My shoes.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.531
I'll do it.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.863
It'd be better.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.978
So, come on.
Why do you love him?

26:54.071 --> 26:57.155
One. Aren't you going
to take notes?

27:00.119 --> 27:03.487
One, he's not like
anyone else.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.789
- No one is.
- Mmm. You'd be surprised.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.117
Two,

27:11.630 --> 27:14.919
he always has a history book in
his pocket and a pencil stub.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.000
Three,

27:17.803 --> 27:22.298
he knows the names of trees and
flowers and constellations.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.262
And he wears plimsolls,
never shoes.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.969
- And his socks never match.
- Exactly.

27:28.397 --> 27:31.936
And he doesn't know the difference
between a croissant and a baguette.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.065
- That's why I love him!
- And do you know what Mummy called him?

27:36.363 --> 27:37.979
God. What?

27:38.073 --> 27:40.190
I heard her on the phone
to Iris Murdoch.

27:40.284 --> 27:43.868
And she said he was
a bit of a country bumpkin!

27:45.998 --> 27:47.205
That's him.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.207
You set eyes on me for the first time...

27:54.298 --> 27:56.836
And I saw a man who wasn't
wearing a jacket.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.508
- What then?
- Loose shirt,

27:59.887 --> 28:02.049
sleeves rolled up
to the elbows,

28:02.139 --> 28:04.756
- tails hanging out.
- Pfft. Nonsense.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.304
<i>Trousers with a mend in the knee,</i>

28:08.228 --> 28:11.392
and long hair,
almost over your ears.

28:12.149 --> 28:13.356
What else?

28:15.194 --> 28:16.435
All right.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.194
I liked the way you stopped
in the doorway

28:23.368 --> 28:26.486
and looked around at everyone
as if you owned the place.

28:27.331 --> 28:28.617
Proud.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.332
No, I mean, bold.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.752
I just needed
to tell someone,

28:35.422 --> 28:36.879
anyone, that I'd got
a first.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.799
Then you saw me
and decided to stare me out.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.969
You glanced at me and decided
I wasn't worth a second look.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.777
Did you think then
it was love at first sight?

29:21.176 --> 29:22.383
Well?

29:27.557 --> 29:29.970
Actually, I'm beginning
to think it was.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.370
It'll do for now.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.017
What's this?

30:17.107 --> 30:18.188
Quintet?

30:18.608 --> 30:20.349
You said I should decide
on the next piece...

30:20.444 --> 30:22.026
But it means getting in
another viola.

30:22.112 --> 30:23.728
Another person. It's going
to change everything.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.779
- It's too soon.
- Say hello to Elsbeth,

30:25.866 --> 30:27.528
in her third year,
awfully good.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.526
Hello.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.157
- Hello.
- Hello.

30:42.799 --> 30:46.588
Right then, we'll begin.
Charles, your big moment.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.921
So I see.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.890
Take it a little slower
than marked.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.514
Again.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.851
It's tender.
Like a question.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.812
It's a series
of questions.

31:30.263 --> 31:31.674
People think you're shy,

31:32.349 --> 31:35.262
but the fact is you're rather tough, aren't you?

31:35.352 --> 31:36.433
Can I buy you that drink?

31:38.188 --> 31:40.225
Oh, I'm late for work.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.372
All artists
to the green room, please.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.791
One minute please, Florence.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.927
Use the wrist,
Florence.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.309
Half a turn each time,
it's not that complicated.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.735
Do you want
to know a secret?

35:16.990 --> 35:17.980
Yes.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.490
Actually, I'm
a little bit scared.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.158
I think I am, too.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.744
- I could...
- Ugh. Just...

36:04.829 --> 36:07.446
For God's sake,
Florence, just hold still.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.122
Turn around.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.761
- Please don't tear it...
- Oh, bloody hell!

36:25.975 --> 36:29.093
Such a clumsy idiot.
I can't even do the simplest thing. A zip!

36:30.897 --> 36:32.263
There's something
wrong with me.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.229
Look, let's sit
on the bed.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.869
You get so cross
sometimes.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.626
- You look like you want to hit someone.
- Do I?

37:00.093 --> 37:02.961
Your face goes
quite frightening.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.554
Tell me something.

37:14.941 --> 37:18.275
- You have beautiful legs and...
- No, not that. Not about me.

37:20.697 --> 37:22.313
"With my body
I thee worship..."

37:22.741 --> 37:25.529
You used to get into fights,
didn't you? You told me.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.577
Tell me about the last time
you got in a fight.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.163
Ugh. It was terrible.
You don't want to hear about that.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.330
I do.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.375
I need to know
your worst side.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.293
All right.

37:43.470 --> 37:48.841
Well, it was
in my final year.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.516
Saturday night.
I went to the Hundred Club.

37:57.317 --> 38:00.776
<i>I was there with this chap,
cleverest person in our year,</i>

38:00.862 --> 38:03.855
<i>I have no idea what he was doing there.
He hated loud music.</i>

38:07.368 --> 38:10.782
- Susie's tits are bigger.
- Lucy's tits aren't so big.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.239
If you want to go all the way with
a girl in the History department...

38:13.374 --> 38:14.990
Or the English
department...

38:15.084 --> 38:16.700
First you've got
to meet her parents.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.331
And then you've got to marry her.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.502
I think I'll head off.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.626
Late night meeting
of the Philosophy Society.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.126
Philosophy.
Uh, that's great. I... I'll come with you.

38:25.887 --> 38:30.552
<i>I really admired Harold and,
uh, wanted him to take me seriously.</i>

38:30.683 --> 38:33.016
<i>And the point about
Gabriel Marcel is this.</i>

38:33.144 --> 38:37.058
As individuals, we're all seeking
harmony in our transient lives

38:37.148 --> 38:40.482
and we find it through what he
called secondary reflection.

38:40.568 --> 38:43.185
The key idea being that
philosophical inquiry

38:43.279 --> 38:45.737
was based on wonder
and astonishment,

38:45.824 --> 38:47.611
and being open to the
presence of others.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.408
Jewboy!

38:50.495 --> 38:51.702
What did you just say?

38:51.788 --> 38:53.154
Edward, don't.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.671
Someone call the police!

39:04.175 --> 39:06.462
Oh, my God, look what
you've done to him!

39:06.594 --> 39:09.928
You brute!
You mad or something? Really!

39:11.057 --> 39:12.389
<i>He avoided me after that.</i>

39:12.475 --> 39:13.966
Call an ambulance!

39:14.060 --> 39:15.471
<i>He never
spoke to me again.</i>

39:16.980 --> 39:20.064
My dad says things about Jews.
Drives me nuts.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.478
Why do you think
he never spoke to you again?

39:25.572 --> 39:27.234
I think
he was ashamed of me.

39:28.241 --> 39:30.107
I'd always been in fights.

39:30.201 --> 39:33.365
In playgrounds,
or outside pubs after kicking-out time.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.787
Edward!
So dangerous and stupid.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.331
People said
I was good at it.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.037
I was proud of myself.

39:41.337 --> 39:42.373
And then?

39:43.006 --> 39:45.043
And then I didn't want to be a
prize-fighting yokel anymore.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.999
I wanted to be cool,
like Harold.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.176
You are.

39:49.929 --> 39:53.593
And now you've got to promise your wife.
No more fights. Ever.

39:55.476 --> 39:56.842
Promise.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.271
Can I ask you
something?

40:11.868 --> 40:13.700
I want to take
your stockings off.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.117
Well, I think
I'd better do it.

40:55.703 --> 40:56.910
So brown.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.614
It was that day
I walked from Henley.

41:34.659 --> 41:35.820
One mile.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.075
Wicket will want rolling
again before tomorrow.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.750
It'll be done,
Mr. Rammage.

42:07.817 --> 42:09.524
Florence!

42:21.164 --> 42:23.326
How did you get here?
How long have you...

42:23.416 --> 42:25.783
I took the train to Henley
and walked through the woods.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.960
I had a map.
Didn't get lost once.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.419
Seven miles.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.039
And then I ate an orange
by the wall near the church,

42:32.133 --> 42:33.874
looking down
across the valley

42:33.968 --> 42:35.675
and checked the map
and I thought,

42:36.846 --> 42:40.806
"He's only one mile away now,
and I've never been so happy in my life."

42:44.520 --> 42:46.102
- Straight.
- Sorry.

43:00.995 --> 43:01.985
Whoo!

43:03.873 --> 43:05.284
No!

43:07.960 --> 43:09.417
- Was that good?
- It was good.

43:10.546 --> 43:12.208
- Did I do a good job?
- Yes.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.752
- You happy?
- Very.

43:16.427 --> 43:17.543
Good.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.350
Work to do.

43:30.650 --> 43:33.017
There! Did you see it?

43:34.112 --> 43:35.648
Yellowhammer?

43:35.738 --> 43:37.650
No! It was going fast
and low over there.

43:38.491 --> 43:39.902
Greenfinch?

43:41.369 --> 43:42.905
Sparrowhawk.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.489
Honestly, Florence,
the only ones you ever get right are robins.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.198
And blackbirds.

43:49.836 --> 43:51.372
What am I
to do with you?

43:55.383 --> 43:57.375
Come on. This way.

43:58.344 --> 43:59.676
Almost home.

44:17.280 --> 44:21.024
Florence, she won't
remember you.

44:21.576 --> 44:24.990
You say that every time.
She might one day.

44:26.122 --> 44:28.114
But she can list every
painting in the Ashmolean.

44:53.149 --> 44:57.689
Marjorie, hello,
it's Florence.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.187
I've come to see you.

45:00.281 --> 45:02.898
Me? Why me?
I've done nothing wrong.

45:37.109 --> 45:40.352
I've brought you something interesting.
From the museum.

45:40.446 --> 45:41.812
We talked about it before.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.989
You told me things
I never knew.

45:44.659 --> 45:47.527
Oh! Uccello.
<i>The Hunt in the Forest.</i>

45:48.246 --> 45:49.657
It's his last.

45:49.789 --> 45:51.621
Look at that perspective.

45:51.707 --> 45:53.323
You told me that
when he was young

45:53.459 --> 45:56.702
he painted his fields blue
in protest at the boring food.

45:56.796 --> 46:01.211
Yes, Vasari says the Abbot gave him cheese
soup followed by cheese pie every day!

46:03.844 --> 46:06.086
I thought we could paint it,
make a copy together.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.923
A forgery!

46:09.016 --> 46:10.348
I'll make some tea.

47:02.403 --> 47:04.065
There are
two more in here.

47:04.155 --> 47:08.490
Sprouting, but they'll do.
Peel 'em and chuck 'em in.

47:08.617 --> 47:10.483
Then we're going to do
something about this floor.

47:10.578 --> 47:11.819
Is there a bucket or...

47:11.912 --> 47:14.620
- Florence! Florence!
- Florence! Florence!

47:14.707 --> 47:16.323
We've got something
to show you.

47:16.417 --> 47:17.783
- Come in here.
- Florence.

47:18.419 --> 47:20.126
Florence!

47:34.852 --> 47:36.218
It's beautiful.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.187
It really is.

47:39.607 --> 47:41.940
We helped.
I did some green.

47:42.026 --> 47:44.143
So did I.
And brown.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.611
- But it was Mum.
- It was truly Mum.

47:48.032 --> 47:50.615
In Uccello the horses
know everything.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.863
They were wild once, you see,
but they've swapped sides.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.577
They're with the hunters now.

47:54.663 --> 47:57.371
They feel guilty.
You can see it in their eyes.

47:59.377 --> 48:00.538
Beautiful.

48:02.046 --> 48:03.332
Good old Mum.

48:03.589 --> 48:04.921
We love you,
Florence.

48:08.636 --> 48:11.219
- Come on, Edward. Lots to do.
- Thank you.

48:22.983 --> 48:25.020
Isn't that Florence
a lovely girl?

48:27.446 --> 48:28.937
Is she the one
who gives me a bath?

48:30.116 --> 48:32.824
No, sweetheart.
Edward's friend.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.866
Anne,
can you put the spoons on the table, please?

48:40.960 --> 48:42.326
All right.

48:42.420 --> 48:45.754
Harriet, right over there.
And the spoons go next to the knife.

48:46.715 --> 48:49.799
Marjorie, do you want
to come and sit down?

48:50.261 --> 48:51.422
Yes, dear.

48:52.888 --> 48:56.222
Um, Mum, you're sitting
over here. I'll sit here.

48:56.308 --> 48:57.765
Marry that girl.

48:57.852 --> 49:01.095
And Florence can sit here,
and Edward can sit here.

49:13.868 --> 49:14.858
Uh...

49:24.628 --> 49:27.871
I'm so glad you're here, my dear.
I've been wanting to try this out.

49:29.675 --> 49:34.420
Rabbit stewed in plums.
All day on a low heat.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.755
You're a marvelous cook,
darling.

49:37.391 --> 49:38.632
It smells delicious.

49:40.686 --> 49:44.555
Do you know, I make all our own jam,
marmalade, chutney.

49:45.107 --> 49:46.188
It never stops.

49:46.275 --> 49:48.141
And you do
a wonderful job.

49:48.486 --> 49:49.897
I do my best.

49:51.739 --> 49:53.901
Do you have children
of your own, dear?

49:53.991 --> 49:55.198
No.

50:23.312 --> 50:24.598
Sort of tickles.

50:26.357 --> 50:27.564
It's all right.

50:42.248 --> 50:43.830
I want to
ask you something.

50:46.877 --> 50:47.913
Yes?

50:49.296 --> 50:52.960
How many girls
have you, you know...

50:56.303 --> 50:59.592
The truth is,
not many really.

51:01.225 --> 51:02.591
How many then?

51:03.561 --> 51:05.974
Just some.

51:12.111 --> 51:13.477
Six?

51:15.322 --> 51:17.860
Yes, about that, or...

51:20.953 --> 51:22.160
I don't know.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.657
Four? Do you think
it was four?

51:29.003 --> 51:30.210
Um...

51:30.296 --> 51:35.508
Flo, it's a... I think it's
a matter of definition.

51:50.232 --> 51:51.723
And what were
their names?

51:51.817 --> 51:54.059
"Their names"? Why are we
talking about...

52:02.202 --> 52:03.909
Well, there are no names.

52:08.459 --> 52:09.870
You're the first.

52:15.466 --> 52:16.877
You are the first.

52:19.887 --> 52:21.469
<i>She used to play Cinderella,</i>

52:21.555 --> 52:24.844
<i>but she took to drugs, narcotics,
and excessive alcohol.</i>

52:24.933 --> 52:27.596
<i>Now, she couldn't even play
the wick in Aladdin's lamp.</i>

52:28.896 --> 52:33.186
<i>And now I have a short scene
from the famous film</i> Dracula.

52:33.275 --> 52:35.312
<i>That girl died.</i>

52:35.611 --> 52:40.322
<i>That was the vampire strangling his,
I mean her victim.</i>

52:43.243 --> 52:46.577
<i>And now we have</i>
Fascination <i>by van Gogh</i>

52:46.664 --> 52:49.657
<i>which now hangs in
the Louvre gallery in Paris.</i>

52:50.834 --> 52:52.325
Fascination.

53:15.818 --> 53:17.684
- Who's that fellow over there?
- Just someone.

53:17.778 --> 53:20.361
- Looks a bit rough.
- Let's start, shall we.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.813
Charles.

54:17.045 --> 54:20.254
Did you like it?
You looked like you'd fallen asleep.

54:20.340 --> 54:22.878
Asleep? No, honestly. I loved it.

54:23.844 --> 54:26.052
I often listen
with my eyes closed.

54:27.347 --> 54:30.181
Look, I can
even sing it.

54:34.313 --> 54:36.054
All right. I take it back.

54:38.650 --> 54:41.814
Come on. I want to show you
where I used to work.

54:53.457 --> 54:56.495
This is where the performers
wait to go on stage.

54:56.627 --> 54:59.210
And afterwards I'd
serve them drinks here.

54:59.338 --> 55:01.330
I once made a cup of tea
for Benjamin Britten.

55:01.423 --> 55:03.289
- Oh, yes, the famous...
- And this peephole.

55:04.384 --> 55:07.297
I'd hear the applause
and watch like this,

55:08.180 --> 55:10.388
and when the players
started to leave the stage,

55:10.808 --> 55:13.767
I'd have to open it smoothly,
without being seen.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.862
Can you imagine the terror and
the thrill of stepping out here

55:26.949 --> 55:28.531
to play your first concert.

55:29.451 --> 55:31.488
These are
discerning audiences.

55:31.578 --> 55:32.819
Yes, it would be
something...

55:32.913 --> 55:35.326
I just know the Ennismore
will play here one day.

55:41.547 --> 55:44.255
And when we do,
I'll choose the Mozart Quintet,

55:44.341 --> 55:45.457
the one you can sing.

55:47.594 --> 55:48.801
Yes.

55:53.642 --> 55:54.883
Yes.

55:56.228 --> 55:57.594
We'll play it beautifully.

55:59.773 --> 56:02.766
The critic from <i>The Times</i>
will be there.

56:02.860 --> 56:04.692
We'll triumph.

56:10.409 --> 56:15.370
And it will be yours,
it'll be specially for you.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.822
It's my promise.

56:23.672 --> 56:28.337
And I'll be here.

56:28.677 --> 56:30.839
Dead center,
three rows back.

56:31.054 --> 56:32.886
Ready to shout at the end.
What is it they shout?

56:32.973 --> 56:34.009
Bravo.

56:34.099 --> 56:37.718
Bravo! Bravo
the Ennismore Quartet!

56:39.062 --> 56:42.226
This is where I'll be,
Florence, this very seat.

56:42.316 --> 56:44.148
Number 9, row C.

56:45.319 --> 56:47.402
And that is my promise.

56:50.032 --> 56:51.944
This was recorded in Berlin.

56:53.118 --> 56:55.201
I've never heard
a stereophonic thingy before.

56:56.622 --> 56:58.079
What's the point of it?

56:58.749 --> 57:01.116
You hear the whole spread
of an orchestra.

57:01.919 --> 57:03.080
Violins on the left,

57:04.296 --> 57:07.334
double basses on the right,
and everything in between.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.842
Stand here,
close your eyes...

57:18.894 --> 57:20.601
You know
what an octave is.

57:21.355 --> 57:25.065
Now you're going to hear the
greatest octave leap there ever was.

57:55.639 --> 57:56.971
I love you!

58:56.074 --> 58:57.190
Florence?

58:59.911 --> 59:01.027
Flo?

59:31.318 --> 59:32.399
Just...

59:33.737 --> 59:36.480
Florence, don't move,
okay? Florence?

59:36.656 --> 59:37.737
Mmm.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.844
All right.
Let me... Let me put this another way.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.436
You don't seem quite as happy
as you should.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:19.276
In love, as you say,
getting married in the summer.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:23.451
No, I am honestly.
I'm very happy.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.787
Something's bothering you,
Flo.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:34.336
It could be the quartet,
the cellist, Charles Morrell.

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:38.086
I think he's a bit taken with me,
keeps asking me out.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.422
That's easy.
Now you've got a fiancÃ©.

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:45.806
Oh, well, you see,
I don't want the quartet to know.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.767
They'll think I'm leaving,
they'll panic.

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:56.984
That's not it though,
is it?

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:15.874
I'm just being silly.

01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:17.455
Could you not talk
to your mother?

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:28.303
- I should go.
- Stay just a little longer.

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:29.725
There's something...
Sit down.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.564
There's something
I want to say.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:39.818
You can change your mind.

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:43.189
So your father's
ordered a marquee,

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:46.492
your mother's getting
measured for a dress,

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:48.410
the invitations are
at the printers.

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:54.785
Flo, these are minor details,
trifles compared to what's at stake.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:01:59.876
It's not too late
to turn back.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.125
I really have to go.
I'm giving a lesson.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:09.220
No. God! No, I mean, hell.
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.096
I'm sorry.

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:13.223
This is a mess.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.649
<i>"This pleasurable excitement</i>

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.277
<i>"causes the penis
to fill with blood</i>

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.859
- <i>"and become engorged..."</i>
- Oh, God.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:32.788
<i>"Secretes a clear substance
to lubricate the mucous membrane."</i>

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:37.376
<i>"And now the foreplay

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.829
<i>"He lies on top of her,</i>

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:43.712
<i>"and it is perfectly acceptable

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.418
<i>"to guide her husband in.</i>

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:48.505
<i>"And at last he enters her."</i>

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:50.718
Enters me.

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:54.510
<i>"He enters her,
and this is known as penetration."</i>

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.720
Flo?

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:57.646
Enter. You may enter me.

01:02:58.024 --> 01:02:59.060
What?

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.358
Nothing.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.356
Are you all right?

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.733
I'm feeling rather sick.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:07.611
What are you reading?

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:08.817
A sex manual.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.365
Flo! Because of Edward?

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:14.489
What does it say?

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:19.286
It says women are like doorways.
Men can enter through them.

01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:23.248
That's so ridiculous!
That simply isn't true.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:24.419
I'm afraid it is.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:27.714
What else does it say?

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.304
You won't like this.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.387
It says the penis...

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.593
Ugh.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.182
- The penis fills with blood.
- Blood?

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:39.351
Ugh!

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:41.223
- No sign of Daddy?
- No.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:44.068
That's just typical.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:47.113
I've got my Spinoza
supervision now, um,

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:49.110
so, Ruth, no running
in the hall,

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:53.406
and Florence, could you delay
your screeching until after tea?

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.753
Come on, Flo, it's easy.
Just point and choose.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.379
But you're not meant
to see it.

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:16.175
<i>What about this one?</i>

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:21.473
<i>No. Awful.
Too creamy and frilly.</i>

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:24.650
I want something simple.
And white.

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:27.274
- White?
- Can I help you young people?

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:29.777
We're late for rehearsal.
Thank you.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.623
- You all right?
- Yes.

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.561
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.822
Edward, tell me something.

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.359
Say something.

01:05:56.911 --> 01:06:00.450
No, say something stupid
like you used to.

01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:08.455
Miss Ponting, you have
a clavicle and a philtrum

01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:11.257
that all men
wish to play on,

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:14.213
and a vibrato
that all men adore,

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:18.548
but you're entirely mine,
and I'm so very glad and proud.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.685
In that case,
you may kiss my vibrato.

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:40.156
Such hard calluses
for so soft a woman.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:46.370
And my philtrum...

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:08.102
There. Is that all right?
Am I squashing you?

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:09.894
No, not really.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:18.611
Sorry.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:21.363
It just...

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.618
I need to...
I can't quite...

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:27.116
- Just lie still.
- Sorry. If you could...

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:31.253
- I know, I'm trying.
- If you could just lift a little.

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:33.672
I know. I'm trying to.
I just... I can't quite...

01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:40.755
<i>"He lies on top of her.</i>

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.725
<i>"And it is perfectly acceptable
for her to use a hand gently</i>

01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:46.388
<i>"to guide her husband in."</i>

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:52.649
Florence.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:55.690
In here.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.649
It's too... Ah!

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:02.192
What is it?

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:04.611
What is it?

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:06.663
Oh, my God!

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.536
Oh!

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:39.817
Don't look at me!

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:43.529
Please don't look at me!
Stop looking at me!

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.354
Edward.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.356
- Here at last.
- Sorry I'm late.

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:20.984
- No one would stop for me.
- Oh, they're idiots.

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:23.448
Perhaps I should get
a haircut.

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:25.617
- Or a new jacket or something.
- Come and see your room.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:29.447
This time Mummy's put you
in the small room, right at the top.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.453
- Hello.
- As far away from me as possible.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:33.658
Very sensible.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.090
It's enormous.

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:47.889
You're beautiful.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.395
Put your arms
right round me.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.861
I like that.

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.656
Daddy wants
to show you the factory.

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:09.736
The job.

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.499
Let me kiss
your vibrato.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:15.746
Stupid.

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:19.209
Do you think you can be a
salesman and write history books?

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:20.414
Someone's got to try it.

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:23.592
And the insurance came through.
You're allowed to drive the Humber.

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:27.054
And Ruth says you're
playing tennis with Daddy.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.008
No. Florence. I'm hopeless.
It's ridiculous. I can't even...

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:31.429
- That's not what you said at dinner.
- I know, but, I...

01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:33.010
It's all right.
He'll simply want to thrash you.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:34.470
Just let him.

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:40.480
But you're mine now.
I want to thrash him.

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:42.276
Don't you dare.

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:47.074
Did Florence tell you?
I'll be giving her a couple of grand.

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.533
Get you both started.

01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:50.702
- That's awfully...
- You any good by the way?

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:54.873
- I'm pretty useless, actually.
- Everyone says that.

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:59.962
I expect you're thinking because you're
young you're going to slaughter me.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:02.585
Well, my friend,
think again.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.214
Anyway, here it is.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.473
Old Ministry
of Defense place.

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.596
Bought it for a song.
Cost less than my boat.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.059
Mostly specialist stuff
made to order for labs.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:26.401
This oscilloscope is being adapted
for Oxford's engineering department.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:29.780
A lot of our work is for universities.
But we could do more.

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:33.620
Perhaps spend a couple of months
here learning what we do,

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.999
get your mind round
some basic electronics.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:42.417
Uh, then you'll go round to universities,
explain our services,

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:44.585
drum up business for us.

01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:48.218
You'll even have
your own office.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.597
Will I have a desk?

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:10.907
Six love. Two sets to me.
One more?

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:13.360
I don't know.
I think I'd rather just go inside...

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:16.743
Your serve. Come on, man.
See if you can get a game.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.449
Just one game.

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:26.794
- Out!
- In.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.803
- Love fifteen.
- I know.

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.300
Thirty-forty.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:41.684
Whoops!

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:45.563
One-four.

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:48.153
For God's sakes, man.
Come on!

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.906
Match point.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:03.205
That's it!

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:06.835
Six love, six love,
six one.

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:13.925
I have to say it. That return of serve,
the drop shot was a complete fluke.

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:16.428
Well, no, actually,
I've been working on that one.

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:23.855
My, God, Florence!
How long have you been there?

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:26.103
Not long at all.
I thought I'd just...

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:28.731
I asked you a question,
damn it. How long?

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:30.608
- About 5 minutes.
- About?

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:32.776
About?

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.699
What the hell do you think
you're up to?

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:37.945
Did I invite you
to spy on me?

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:39.947
Well?

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.324
Answer me!

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:17.628
There you are. Did you really
need to come this far?

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:18.844
Yes.

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.422
It must be two miles
back to the hotel.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.178
I needed to get out.

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:29.098
Look, this is ridiculous.
It was unfair of you to run out like that.

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.807
- Was it?
- Yes.

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:32.935
In fact, it was unpleasant.
Bloody unpleasant.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:35.442
- Yes.
- What do you mean, "Yes"?

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.272
You know exactly
what I mean.

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:42.281
It was absolutely
revolting.

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:51.044
You don't have the faintest idea
how to be with a man, do you?

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:55.248
If you did, it would
never have happened.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:16:01.221
In all this time,
you've never let me near you.

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:03.048
You've never let me...

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:06.968
You don't know a thing
about any of it, do you?

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:09.638
- Please don't bully me.
- I'm not bullying you.

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:11.640
Yes, you are.
Edward, you are!

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:13.608
- You're talking bloody nonsense.
- I'm trying to...

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.686
You're the one who stopped us
getting close.

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:18.988
When we hold hands you think
you're doing me a favor.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:20.065
You're so stuck up!

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:22.363
- Is that what you think?
- Yes, it bloody well is what I think.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:24.786
Then why are you here?

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:28.331
Why are you chasing me
down the beach?

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.285
Why can't you let me
just sit here by myself?

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:45.222
Edward, I want
to make you happy.

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:49.682
But I think I'm always
a disappointment.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.649
You're always advancing,
I'm always backing away.

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.607
And we can't
talk about it.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:03.692
We can never just
be happy. Or just be.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:09.406
You're always demanding something more,
and I'm useless at...

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:18.841
And you go silent and unhappy
and it's all my fault.

01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:22.172
And when I do...

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:26.298
I mean when I say yes to something
even if I don't really want to,

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:28.975
I know there'll be another
thing that I'm expected to do.

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:30.597
I'm no good
at these demands.

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:31.929
Demands?

01:17:32.022 --> 01:17:33.854
Well, what I mean is...

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:36.103
You think I'm some sort
of debt collector.

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.690
I hope you're not
talking about money.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.148
Of course, I'm not.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.449
That's it, isn't it? Money?

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.034
- Honestly, I wasn't talking about...
- I don't care about money...

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:48.119
- I didn't mention money, Edward.
- ...yours or anyone's.

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:49.537
- I know you don't.
- So keep your money.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:52.457
You think I demanded
that job from your father?

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:57.584
It was your idea. And do you know what?
I don't want to work for him.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.960
- Tell him I've changed my mind!
- I know you don't mean that.

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:02.334
- It's just because you're feeling...
- I bloody well do!

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:14.813
But why did you run off like that?
You shouldn't have done that.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.390
I've already...
I've already told you.

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:23.359
- You wanted to humiliate me.
- No, honestly.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.486
It's something...

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:29.194
I can't explain it.

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:33.790
I don't know what it is,
why I ran away.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.246
I got in such a state.

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:38.294
- I was ashamed...
- So you humiliated me.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.374
All right, then. If that's what you want!
I was trying to humiliate you.

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:46.754
It's no less than you deserve when
you can't even control yourself.

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:48.588
You're a bitch
talking like that!

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.025
Edward, please go away.

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:25.504
We could be so free
with each other.

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:28.841
We could make each other
so happy.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:36.097
Instead,
we're in this mess.

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:42.184
Yes.

01:19:44.321 --> 01:19:45.562
Meaning what exactly?

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:46.772
It's a mess.

01:19:50.744 --> 01:19:51.985
It's hopeless.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.456
Is it?

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.269
Is it a nightingale?

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.736
It's a blackbird.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:37.576
As late as this?

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:42.502
It must be a prime site he's on.

01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:46.247
He's doing overtime,
having to work hard.

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:50.881
Like me.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.761
Edward, no, please.

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:09.897
There's something
I want to say to you.

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.526
It's not...

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:12.949
What?

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.947
You know I love you.

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:18.538
Still.

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.624
I want to spend
my life with you.

01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:23.664
And you feel the same.

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.919
We love each other,
and we can set each other free.

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:33.302
Edward, it must be obvious
to you by now that I'm...

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:37.298
- Florence, what is it?
- That I'm pretty hopeless.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.600
No, I'm absolutely
hopeless at sex.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.393
I'm no good at it.

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:49.485
I don't seem to need it like other people,
like you do.

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:54.444
I might change,
but I can't imagine it.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:22:00.075
If I don't say this now we'll
always be struggling with it.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:04.413
It's going to cause you a lot of unhappiness,
and me, too.

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:06.461
Florence, I don't understand
what you're...

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.038
Mummy knows two homosexuals.

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:10.965
They live in a flat together,
like man and wife.

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:13.338
Two men. In Oxford,
in Beaumont Street.

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:15.512
They both teach
at the University.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:19.382
And we can live by our own rules too,
Edward.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.602
I can say this because
I know you love me.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.185
We don't have to be
like everyone else.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.729
We could live together and...

01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:30.193
And so...

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.358
And no one would know
what we did or didn't do.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:38.740
We'd be together,
and if you wanted, really wanted,

01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:42.288
that's to say, whenever it happened,
and, of course, it would happen,

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:45.534
I'd understand,
more than that, I'd want it.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:48.119
Because I want you
to be happy and free.

01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:52.382
I'd never be jealous,
as long as I knew that you loved me.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:55.464
Oh, God.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:57.671
Honestly, my darling,

01:22:59.349 --> 01:23:02.217
I just want to be
with you all my life,

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.143
look after you,
be happy with you,

01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:05.978
and work
with the quartet,

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:07.726
and one day at Wigmore Hall

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.775
play something glorious
and beautiful for you

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:12.102
like the Mozart.

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:15.237
Have I...

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:19.033
Have I got this right?

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:24.239
You want me to go with other women.
Is that it?

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:26.416
Not if you didn't want to.

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:28.960
Have you actually forgotten
that we were married today?

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:33.670
We're not two old queers living
in secret on Beaumont Street.

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.341
We're man and wife!

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:46.352
"With my body
I thee worship!"

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.346
That's what
you promised today.

01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:50.144
In front of everybody!

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:54.778
Are you so innocent and stupid
that you don't realize

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:57.901
how disgusting and
ridiculous your idea is?

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:01.071
And what an insult it is?

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:02.944
An insult to me!

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:17.754
You tricked me.

01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:22.513
You're a fraud.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.312
And I know
what else you are.

01:24:32.442 --> 01:24:33.728
Do you know what you are?

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.691
Frigid.

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:40.482
That's what.

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:44.160
Completely frigid.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:49.157
You thought
you needed a husband,

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:53.620
and I was the first bloody
fool to come along.

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:52.132
Edward? Edward?

01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:20.077
Hello, Edward, love.
Have you been at work?

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:22.790
But where's Florence?

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:26.378
Oh, my God, son.

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:37.309
<i>And what about
all those presents?</i>

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.933
They'll all be sent back.
Dad's writing to Mrs. Ponting.

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:42.773
- Why can't we see Florence?
- We love her.

01:28:43.193 --> 01:28:45.651
- Why won't you tell us what's happened?
- Look...

01:28:46.947 --> 01:28:49.439
One day when you're grown up,
you'll understand.

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:51.774
But listen, I want you
to make me a promise,

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:53.029
a really solemn promise.

01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.657
That you'll never ever mention
her name to me again,

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:58.490
or ask me any more questions
about her. Do you understand?

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:00.120
Hands on hearts.

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:02.789
- Edward. This is so stupid.
- I mean it.

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:16.390
And the job.

01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:19.719
You'll have to write
to Mr. Ponting.

01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:21.638
I already have.

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:30.821
I've had a letter back
from Florence's mother.

01:29:32.158 --> 01:29:34.195
- Here, you'd better read it.
- I'd rather not.

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:40.827
Well...

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:45.828
Anyway, it's agreed.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:52.509
Non consummation.

01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:02.348
Come on, son.

01:30:05.609 --> 01:30:07.692
Is there really nothing
you want to tell me?

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:18.327
Are you sure?

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:44.948
Eddy.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:48.288
Look at this.

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:49.998
What?

01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:52.959
Does that list not look
familiar to you?

01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:58.261
- We have all these records already.
- What?

01:32:01.725 --> 01:32:04.012
I don't know what they've done here.
It's a mess.

01:32:04.102 --> 01:32:06.435
Looks like they've sent
last month's order.

01:32:06.896 --> 01:32:08.307
And this month's.

01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:10.060
Uh...

01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:11.607
They got it totally mixed up.

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:13.984
Well, we'll just have
to separate them out,

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:15.777
and call,
what's his name?

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:19.239
- Bob.
- He could come by this afternoon.

01:32:24.247 --> 01:32:26.910
Excuse me. Do you have
any Chuck Berry?

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:29.500
Sure.

01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:33.829
Didn't we have
this problem before?

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:35.877
Reckon we did.

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:38.546
Let's see...

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.712
How about a "Best of"?

01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:43.593
That's perfect.

01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:48.848
You don't look the sort
to be into this kind of thing.

01:32:48.938 --> 01:32:51.601
It's not for me.
It's for my mum's birthday.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.938
She's pretty old.
She's going to be 36.

01:32:57.739 --> 01:32:59.355
It's not so old really.

01:33:00.533 --> 01:33:03.071
You see, she only listens
to classical music

01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:04.652
but she does like Chuck Berry.

01:33:05.371 --> 01:33:06.578
Me too.

01:33:06.664 --> 01:33:09.202
She always says he's bouncy and merry.

01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:16.213
She'll be so surprised.
But how much is it?

01:33:16.299 --> 01:33:18.336
I've only got 75p.

01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:22.587
Oh, it's...

01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:30.394
It's okay.
You can have it.

01:33:31.314 --> 01:33:32.555
I want you
to have it.

01:33:33.316 --> 01:33:34.682
Are you really sure?

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:37.397
Yes.

01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:41.530
Amazing. And thank you.
I'll put my money into your charity...

01:33:41.616 --> 01:33:43.027
No, no.
There is no need...

01:33:46.162 --> 01:33:50.497
Just... Just tell her,
you know...

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:54.830
Tell her "happy birthday."

01:33:55.255 --> 01:33:58.293
But happy birthday from who?

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:01.458
Um...

01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:05.926
Oh, from...
You know, from the shop.

01:34:07.767 --> 01:34:10.726
Bye then. And thanks again.
You're really nice.

01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:13.474
Wait.

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:16.189
You haven't told me
your name.

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:21.104
Chloe. Chloe Morrell. Bye.

01:35:14.834 --> 01:35:18.123
- So she borrowed this bike...
- Nah, she stole it.

01:35:18.213 --> 01:35:19.704
Went shooting down the hill,
to his mother's house

01:35:19.797 --> 01:35:22.540
and said, "Look,
here's your money back."

01:35:29.182 --> 01:35:30.593
It's not always
like that.

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.306
I knew this couple once.

01:35:37.023 --> 01:35:38.685
Very straight.

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:42.234
Sort of innocent
and young.

01:35:44.113 --> 01:35:45.399
And she was
very beautiful.

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:52.991
So they get married, you know,
the whole conventional thing.

01:35:53.706 --> 01:35:55.948
Church and cake.

01:35:56.793 --> 01:35:59.251
- Honeymoon in a hotel by the sea...
- Mmm.

01:36:00.672 --> 01:36:02.129
And on the big night,

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:07.256
it doesn't quite work out,
you know, in bed.

01:36:09.806 --> 01:36:11.843
And she gets
really upset.

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:16.344
And she tells him that
she's not really into sex.

01:36:18.231 --> 01:36:22.100
That when they live together,
he can have it with anyone he likes.

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:26.399
- Anyone but her.
- What an offer.

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:28.522
Does she love him?

01:36:29.993 --> 01:36:31.200
Yes.

01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:35.613
She does.
She really does.

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:38.407
But that's the thing,
you see, he doesn't get it.

01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:39.537
He shouldn't have listened.

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:41.664
He just should have
slipped her one on the beach.

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:44.038
Typical.

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:46.085
You're so sensitive.

01:36:46.759 --> 01:36:48.170
He's too angry.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.216
He doesn't see that...

01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:55.257
Well, the thing is...

01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:59.056
She really loves him.

01:37:00.732 --> 01:37:02.564
And she doesn't want
to let him down.

01:37:05.778 --> 01:37:09.943
But she wants to be with him,
and she wants him to be happy.

01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:15.406
So, it all comes apart
that night on the beach.

01:37:18.124 --> 01:37:19.365
They never...

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:22.872
They never see
each other again.

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:31.753
Married for six hours.

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:40.769
What happened to her?

01:37:42.815 --> 01:37:43.896
I don't know.

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:48.360
I guess she, um...

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:52.405
I don't know.

01:38:17.683 --> 01:38:19.094
All right. Here we go.

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:27.604
Didn't even see it.
Too damn slow.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.136
<i>Almost half a century ago,</i>

01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.469
<i>four students at the
Royal College of Music</i>

01:39:03.563 --> 01:39:05.099
<i>began to meet informally</i>

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:06.805
<i>to play some favorite pieces</i>

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:08.891
<i>and improve
their ensemble technique.</i>

01:39:09.444 --> 01:39:12.653
<i>The result was the now
celebrated Ennismore Quartet.</i>

01:39:13.406 --> 01:39:15.523
<i>This October at Wigmore
Hall in London,</i>

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:18.734
<i>they'll present a program of Mozart,
Beethoven and Britten</i>

01:39:18.828 --> 01:39:21.992
<i>to celebrate 45 years
of great music making.</i>

01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:24.498
<i>A performance given
even greater significance</i>

01:39:24.584 --> 01:39:26.200
<i>by the recent announcement</i>

01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:29.037
<i>that this will be the
Ennismore's farewell concert.</i>

01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:31.122
<i>Yesterday, at their
Primrose Hill home,</i>

01:39:31.215 --> 01:39:35.459
<i>I spoke to violinist Florence Morrell
and her husband Charles, the cellist,</i>

01:39:35.553 --> 01:39:36.919
<i>asking them first</i>

01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:40.177
<i>how hard it had been to reconcile
a successful domestic existence,</i>

01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:44.055
<i>three children, five grandchildren,
with the demands of international...</i>

01:40:10.046 --> 01:40:11.253
Thank you, darling.

01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:17.501
Bye, Mum.
Best of luck.

01:40:19.639 --> 01:40:22.473
Bye, Dad.
Best of luck.

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:31.856
- There you go, Dad.
- Thanks, my boy.

01:40:31.943 --> 01:40:34.481
Mom, we are so proud
of you both.

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:20.646
Bravo.

01:43:57.523 --> 01:43:59.014
I am sorry, Edward.

01:44:01.527 --> 01:44:03.268
I am most terribly sorry.

01:44:10.786 --> 01:44:12.197
Let's go back now...

01:44:13.289 --> 01:44:14.496
Together.

01:44:18.002 --> 01:44:19.334
Edward?
