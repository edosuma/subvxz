ANNOUNCER: We now return
to How I Met Your Father.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.747
Oh, Barney, I'm never
going to meet

00:38.830 --> 00:39.998
the right girl
and get married.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.333
You know, Ted,
don't you think

00:41.416 --> 00:43.252
it's kinda strange
for a guy in his 20s

00:43.335 --> 00:44.628
to always be talking
about getting married

00:44.711 --> 00:46.880
rather than
getting laid?

00:46.964 --> 00:49.508
Barney, I'm in love
with you.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.927

All right,

It's ballet night.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.059
(all groan)

00:59.142 --> 01:01.562
Lois, don't freakin'
put me through this again.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.147
Peter, a little culture
is good for this family.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.358
Besides, you liked
The Nutcracker, didn't you?

01:06.441 --> 01:07.985
No, Lois, I did not.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.404
The Nutcracker
had zero physical comedy.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.155
And with a name
like The Nutcracker

01:12.239 --> 01:14.074
I thought, "Oh, this
will be worth a few yuks,"

01:14.157 --> 01:16.243
but no, Lois, that title
wrote a check

01:16.326 --> 01:18.495
that those queers
on stage refused to cash.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.080
Peter, we're going.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.623
Well, we're not the first people

01:21.707 --> 01:23.584

Damn it!
I swear to God

01:28.797 --> 01:30.674
I will turn
this ship around!

01:30.757 --> 01:32.467
That works.
Okay. It'll teach us a lesson.

even better.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.729
You know, Meg,
female ballet dancers

01:43.812 --> 01:45.480
are famous for
anorexia and bulimia.

01:45.564 --> 01:49.026

any good pot connections

01:58.535 --> 01:59.661
What?
Yeah.

Lois, we'll be right back.

I have a history test
today, Mom,

03:05.352 --> 03:06.770
and I couldn't study
last night

03:06.854 --> 03:09.147
because you made us go
to the ballet.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.608
Well, Chris, you're not gonna
learn any history from this.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.653
This textbook is from 1948.
What?

03:14.736 --> 03:15.988
Chapter 3:

03:16.071 --> 03:19.074
"Youth culture rebels
with Big Band music."

Let me see that.

"Israel, the brand-new country
everyone's gonna love."

03:24.413 --> 03:26.039
What the hell?
Are the schools so underfunded

03:26.123 --> 03:28.250
that they can't
afford textbooks from this century?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.169
Well, I am going to raise hell
about this

03:30.252 --> 03:31.753
at the next PTA meeting.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.172
Well, let me know
if you need help.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.506
I can be very persuasive.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.176
I gave the next speech
after the Braveheart guy.

They can take our lives,

our freedom!

03:44.183 --> 03:46.894
And... and let's
not forget the tax

03:46.977 --> 03:48.228
they levied
on properties

03:48.312 --> 03:50.814
that are in abutment
of church lands.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.534
For our first order
of business,

04:02.618 --> 04:04.244
we'll go to Bruce.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.080
(singsong):
Well, hey, y'all said my name.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.541
Welcome to our meeting
here at the school.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.211
We got lots of exciting
topics here tonight.

04:12.294 --> 04:15.005
We gonna have a puppet show.
We gonna have some jazz.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.632
No, I'm just kidding.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.384
We have some business
to take care of, though.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.512
I'm sorry I pulled y'all's legs.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.932
I'm just a little excited
'cause I met somebody today.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.142
(singsong):
Someone in the bookstore.

04:27.226 --> 04:30.687
Someone who likes the same kind
of literature as I do.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.232
Oh, and the adventure begins
again.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.858
Excuse me,
Principal Shepherd.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.485
There's something
I'd like to discuss.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.238
The school has gone too far
with these budget cuts.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.032
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin,
but the No Child Left Behind law

04:42.115 --> 04:43.909
cost us our federal funding

04:43.992 --> 04:46.161
because our students'
test scores were too low.

04:46.245 --> 04:49.289
They cut a school's funding
if it's got low test scores?

04:49.373 --> 04:52.251
This is not what the
founding fathers had in mind.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.669
Okay, we're here to sign

04:53.752 --> 04:55.504
this declaration
of our independence.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.755
Let's take roll call first.

04:56.839 --> 04:57.840
Thomas Jefferson?

04:57.923 --> 04:58.924
Here.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.425
Benjamin Franklin.
Here.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.552
John Footpenis?

05:01.635 --> 05:02.636
It's Hancock now.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.720
Why?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.347
Mind your business.
That's why.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.974
Well, somehow this school needs

05:07.057 --> 05:09.059
to raise its test scores
right away.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.645
I suppose there is one thing
I can do

05:11.728 --> 05:13.063
to raise the school's
test average.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.189
Then do it.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.691
All right, we'll drop

05:15.774 --> 05:17.526
the dumbest student we have:

05:17.609 --> 05:20.028
Chris Griffin
is hereby expelled.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.572
But if I leave now,

05:21.655 --> 05:23.699
I won't hear who's
the dumbest kid in the school.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.707
Cool, I don't have
to go to school.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.209
I can just pee in my bed
all day.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.587
Chris, being expelled
is a serious thing.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.797
Peter, we've got to find
another school for him.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.674
I say, I could home-school him.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.219
After all, I taught Cleveland
how to make Jiffy Pop.

05:44.303 --> 05:47.514
Oh! (laughing)

05:47.598 --> 05:49.683
Oh! Oh!

05:52.895 --> 05:55.480
So do you think your school
would be right for Chris?

05:55.564 --> 05:56.940
Oh, absolutely.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.984

for the Deaf has great programs,

to Lincoln?!

06:06.366 --> 06:07.534

Maritime School, Chris.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.390

at a time.

Up on the deck
with lots of men

06:36.855 --> 06:38.690
or down in the galley
with lots of men.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.734
Is this some kind
of pirate school?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.945
Well, a certain
kind of pirate.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.446

You know, I have to admit

06:52.162 --> 06:53.997
I've always been
a little worried about Chris,

06:54.081 --> 06:55.874
but I guess I just
convinced myself

06:55.958 --> 06:57.417
things would
work out for him,

06:57.501 --> 06:58.919
but with no education,

what kind of future
can he possibly have?

What are we supposed
to do, Lois?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.341

the high school will take him back.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.667
You let go
of the check.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.918
I'm not taking my hand
off this thing.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.920
Well, neither am I.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.547
Let go of the check.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.173
Ernie, if he wants to...
Stay out of this!

11:13.257 --> 11:14.800
Don't you talk to
my wife like that!

11:14.883 --> 11:16.718
Oh, yeah? What are you
gonna do about it?

11:45.455 --> 11:47.291
(electric knife whirring)

11:47.374 --> 11:49.001
(bubbling)

11:49.084 --> 11:50.961
Aah!

11:51.044 --> 11:52.379
(screaming)

11:57.843 --> 12:01.013
(pants)

12:16.403 --> 12:19.239
(panting)

12:19.740 --> 12:20.741
Sorry.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.367
And every other school
we've tried

12:22.451 --> 12:24.328
just doesn't seem to be
a good fit for Chris.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.580
Well, there is
one other option.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.336
Daddy, there's something
I need you to do for me.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.880
Chris got expelled
from James Woods High,

12:34.963 --> 12:37.049
and, well, I was wondering
if you could get him

12:37.132 --> 12:39.551
into that fancy
boarding school you went to.

12:39.635 --> 12:42.221
You want me to get Chris
into Morningwood Academy?

12:42.304 --> 12:44.306
It would mean so much
to our family.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.975
All right, I'll pull some
strings on one condition:

12:47.059 --> 12:49.811
I want Peter to do something
really humiliating.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.980
Well, what did you
have in mind?

12:52.064 --> 12:54.816
He has to shoot and star
in a shot-for-shot remake

12:54.900 --> 12:57.277
of Liar, Liar
for my amusement.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.654
Do you know why
I stopped you?

12:58.737 --> 12:59.738
I didn't fasten my seat belt.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.073
I didn't look
in my rear view mirror.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.200
I didn't signal when I pulled
away from the curb. I almost hit a Chevy.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.952
I changed lanes in the
intersection without signaling.

13:05.035 --> 13:08.497
I changed lanes while running
a red light and speeding!

13:08.580 --> 13:10.290
Ha...!

13:17.214 --> 13:18.632
Well, Chris, here we are.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.051
Wow, this school is really nice.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.219
Boy, a degree from here

13:22.302 --> 13:23.804
would set you up
with any job you wanted.

13:23.887 --> 13:26.223
Yes, I should attend
this institution.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.184
Perhaps one day I could be
more powerful than King Friday.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.187
I am the supreme ruler of the
Neighborhood of Make Believe.

13:32.271 --> 13:35.357
All will kneel before my...
(train whistles)

13:35.440 --> 13:38.527
(sighs) What kind of freakin' king
lives next to the train tracks?

13:38.610 --> 13:40.487
What is this, Mexico?

13:43.657 --> 13:44.658
Hi.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.326
Is this room 214?

13:46.410 --> 13:48.245
Oh, you must be
our new dorm mate.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.746
I'm Rogers Chapstick,

13:49.830 --> 13:51.790
heir to the
Chapstick fortune.

13:51.874 --> 13:55.586
And this is Virgil MasterCard,
heir to the MasterCard fortune.

13:55.669 --> 14:02.176
Oh, yes, yes,
how do you do, sirrrr?

14:02.259 --> 14:04.469
And this is James
Bottomtooth IV.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.638
(speaking unintelligibly)

14:06.722 --> 14:08.765
Uh... I'm Chris.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.142
Let me get
those bags for you.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.226
Johann?

14:13.896 --> 14:14.897
(whispering)

14:14.980 --> 14:16.398
Um, oh, dear.

14:16.481 --> 14:19.568
Johann tells me your luggage
is the luggage of the poor.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.029
Well... I am poor.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.280
Oh.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.490
Oh, I see.

14:36.627 --> 14:37.669
What the...? Aah! Ow!

14:37.753 --> 14:39.254
Ow! Ow! Ow!

14:39.338 --> 14:40.380
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

14:40.464 --> 14:42.341
This school is not
for your kind!

14:42.424 --> 14:43.634
Why?!

14:43.717 --> 14:46.595
(speaking unintelligibly)

14:46.678 --> 14:49.681
I still don't fully understand!

14:59.316 --> 15:00.651
...and that was
the third time

15:00.734 --> 15:02.277
I slept with
Katherine Harris.

15:02.361 --> 15:05.531
Well, I love her politics,
but how is she in bed?

15:05.614 --> 15:07.616
Well, as anyone in
Florida will tell you,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.201
she knows how
to rig an erection.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.245
(laughing haughtily)

15:11.328 --> 15:13.205
(sustained laugh)

15:13.288 --> 15:15.082
One time
I picked my nose

15:15.165 --> 15:17.668
and I swear I could feel
the bottom of my eye.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.336
Shut up, poor kid.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.796
No, I'm serious. Look!

15:26.885 --> 15:28.762
So, Chris, how's the new school?

15:28.846 --> 15:31.265
It's awful.
I hate it!

15:31.348 --> 15:33.892
Everybody's mean to me
because I'm not rich.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.811
Oh, no, Chris,
that's horrible.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.563
All right, look,
I'll tell you what.

15:37.646 --> 15:40.357
I'll call Daddy and I'll see if there's
anything he can do.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.486
Phew.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.988
Well, that's enough fun
for one day.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.782
I'm sweating more than
a non-legacy applying to Yale.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.451
(laughing haughtily)

15:51.535 --> 15:56.039
(sustained laugh)

15:56.123 --> 16:00.669
(sustained laugh)

16:02.713 --> 16:04.381
(groans)

16:05.007 --> 16:06.341
(gasps)

16:06.425 --> 16:07.676
(screams)

16:09.261 --> 16:10.387
(echoing footsteps)

16:13.807 --> 16:15.267
Where am I?

16:16.226 --> 16:17.311
Grandpa?

16:17.394 --> 16:18.687
What are you
doing here?

16:18.770 --> 16:21.857
Chris, welcome to the
Skull and Bones Society.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.026
This is where the most
powerful men in the world

16:24.109 --> 16:25.527
are groomed for their futures.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.779
Every president, every CEO,

16:27.863 --> 16:29.740
every douchebag
named Ryan Seacrest.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.408
The Skull and Bones Society

16:31.491 --> 16:33.577
has been a part of
my family for decades,

16:33.660 --> 16:35.495
and we want you
to become a member.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.831
Really?
Wow, cool!

16:37.915 --> 16:39.082
Excellent.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.792
You get your own
stock portfolio,

16:40.876 --> 16:42.711
a percentage of
the 9/11 Victims' Fund,

16:42.794 --> 16:45.005
and the best medical
care on the planet.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.549
You'll be kept as
healthy as a horse.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.301
So, how's that leg doing?

16:49.384 --> 16:50.469
Great. Great.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.803
Never better.
Good.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.347
Why don't you try putting
some weight on it?

16:53.430 --> 16:55.349
Eh, sure.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.767
(pained):
Yes! Yes!

16:56.850 --> 16:58.393
Oh, that's good.
That feels good.

16:58.477 --> 16:59.811
Very strong.

16:59.895 --> 17:02.606
Sorry, Thunder,
I gotta put you down.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.733
(screams)
How's your leg, huh?!

17:04.816 --> 17:06.151
How's your leg?!
You ready to race?!

17:06.235 --> 17:07.236
Huh?!

17:07.319 --> 17:09.488
(sings starting gate fanfare)

17:12.324 --> 17:14.409
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to
Japanese Girls

17:14.493 --> 17:16.578
Think Small Versions of Things
Are Really Cute.

17:16.662 --> 17:18.705
Oh, look at my tiny dog.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.332
I'm gonna put it
in my tiny purse.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.583
(giggles)

17:21.667 --> 17:23.001
Tiny phone!

17:23.085 --> 17:24.169
Tiny everything!

17:24.253 --> 17:26.505
(giggling)

17:26.588 --> 17:28.715
Peter, have you seen
this tuition bill?

17:28.799 --> 17:31.885
Morningwood Academy
is charging us $30,000.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.513
Well, looks like we're all
gonna have to take second jobs.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.473
I guess I'll see if
I can get my old gig back

17:36.557 --> 17:38.392
selling buttscratchers
at the ballpark.

17:38.475 --> 17:39.935
Buttscratcher!

17:40.018 --> 17:41.895
Buttscratcher!
Get your buttscratcher here!

17:41.979 --> 17:42.980
Buttscratcher!

17:43.063 --> 17:44.064
Buttscratcher!

17:44.147 --> 17:45.148
Buttscratcher!

17:45.232 --> 17:46.233
Buttscratcher.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.317
Buttscratcher.

17:47.401 --> 17:48.402
Buttscratcher!

17:48.485 --> 17:49.486
Buttscratcher!

17:53.782 --> 17:55.200
Chris, come here.
You'll love this.

17:55.284 --> 17:56.994
The first Thursday
of every month

17:57.077 --> 17:59.079
we go to a local orphanage,
pick out a kid,

17:59.162 --> 18:01.540
fill out all the paperwork
and then don't take him home.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.708
It's hilarious.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.459
That sounds
kind of cruel.

18:04.543 --> 18:06.003
No, no, you'll love it.
It's great.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.339
Come on.

18:09.423 --> 18:10.424
Come on in.

18:10.507 --> 18:11.884
Your family's
waiting in here.

18:11.967 --> 18:14.386
There are toys.
And a puppy.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.889
And food that's not served
from warming trays.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.728
Come on.
You gotta want it.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.230
Ah, you gotta do
better than that.

18:25.314 --> 18:28.567
Okay, I guess you don't want
a new family, toys, and a puppy.

18:28.650 --> 18:29.776
(tires screech)

18:33.530 --> 18:35.782
Hi, everybody, I'm home.

18:35.866 --> 18:36.950
Hi, Chris.
Hello. Hey, how are you?

18:37.034 --> 18:39.161
Well, tell us everything,
sweetie.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.579
How's school going so far?

18:40.662 --> 18:41.788
It's great, Mom.

18:41.872 --> 18:43.540
I got powerful
connections now,

18:43.624 --> 18:44.708
thanks to Grandpa.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.043
Chris, I'd
give you a hug,

18:46.126 --> 18:47.711
but I'm exhausted
from working two jobs

18:47.794 --> 18:49.379
to pay your tuition.

18:49.463 --> 18:50.672
I've been selling
buttscratchers.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.174
Buttscratcher!
No, Peter.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.884
Buttscratcher.
Peter, no.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.761
Buttscratcher!
No!

18:55.844 --> 18:57.679
(sadly):
Buttscratcher.

18:57.763 --> 19:01.725
Dad, you... you got an extra job
just to put me through school?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.101
We all did, Chris.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.853
Meg and I have been
working nights.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.023
I'll take the one
on the right.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.193
Well, once again, Meg,
I'll be back in an hour.

19:11.276 --> 19:14.238
And I got a job following
fat people around with a tuba.

19:15.948 --> 19:17.866
(playing comical tune)

19:17.950 --> 19:19.535
Stop it.

19:19.618 --> 19:21.662
Cut it out.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.997
I have a glandular
problem.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.332
(tuba whinnies)

19:25.415 --> 19:26.875
That'll be $60.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.135
You wanted to see me, Grandpa?

19:37.219 --> 19:38.220
Yes, Chris.

19:38.303 --> 19:39.596
Your pledge period
is over.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.056
The Skull and Bones elders

19:41.139 --> 19:43.308
are now ready
to admit you to our ranks.

19:43.392 --> 19:45.936
As is customary with
all our new members,

19:46.019 --> 19:47.855
you now have to spend
seven minutes in the closet

19:47.938 --> 19:49.606
with our most senior member.

19:49.690 --> 19:53.026
We don't start the clock
until the door closes.

19:53.110 --> 19:55.612
You know, Grandpa, I don't think
I want to go through with it.

19:55.696 --> 19:56.864
We all had
to do it, Chris.

19:56.947 --> 19:58.532
Now get in there.
No, I mean,

19:58.615 --> 20:00.659
I think I want to go
back to my old school.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.453
My family's working so hard
to pay my tuition here,

20:03.537 --> 20:05.205
and I feel bad.

20:05.289 --> 20:08.542
Is there any way you can get me
back into James Woods High?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.961
Well, I suppose I could
pull some strings

20:11.044 --> 20:12.629
if that's really
what you want, Chris.

20:12.713 --> 20:13.755
It is.

20:13.839 --> 20:15.340
All right,
consider it done.

20:15.424 --> 20:16.675
Thanks, Grandpa.

20:18.177 --> 20:20.762
Sorry, Master Herbert.
Sorry?

20:20.846 --> 20:23.599
You better get your
ass in that closet, Pewterschmidt.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.517
Yes, sir.

20:25.601 --> 20:27.644
I am so tired of you.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.650
Ah, it's good
to have you back, buddy.

20:33.734 --> 20:34.818
Thanks, Dad.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.612
I didn't really
fit in there anyway.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.614
The rooms were only 15x20.

20:38.697 --> 20:42.034
(laughing)

20:42.117 --> 20:43.827
If I didn't learn
to laugh at myself,

20:43.911 --> 20:45.329
I'd be dead right now.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.289
Why don't you take your stuff
up to your room, Chris?

20:47.372 --> 20:49.291
Okay, Mom.

20:50.334 --> 20:51.376
(tuba playing)

20:51.460 --> 20:53.795
Cut it out.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.048
I'm just trying
to live my life.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.342
No one taught me
about carbs.
