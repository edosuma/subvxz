Hey!

01:00.871 --> 01:03.638
Cynthia, you're back so soon.

01:03.673 --> 01:05.640
- I love that necklace.
- Oh, thank you.

01:05.675 --> 01:07.541
It's an early Christmas present
from myself.

01:07.577 --> 01:09.543
- Good for you.
- Your usual booth?

01:09.579 --> 01:11.846
- I'll take that for you.
- Thank you so much.

01:11.882 --> 01:13.815
Toni has made some wonderful
chocolate-almond croissants--

01:13.850 --> 01:16.084
- Oh, yeah?
- And there you go.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.986
You know what I want.
But I'll take two.

01:18.054 --> 01:19.687
Are you back on the market?

01:19.722 --> 01:22.023
I actually have a date,
and he's on his way here.

01:22.058 --> 01:25.026
Oh, good. It's just that
last time when you ate up--

01:25.061 --> 01:27.662
Never mind. Two chocolate
delights coming right up.

01:27.697 --> 01:29.297
Thank you.

01:37.941 --> 01:40.641
- New suit?
- I'm sorry?

01:40.677 --> 01:42.911
No, I-- I was just asking
if it was a new suit

01:42.946 --> 01:44.478
'cause you got the--

01:44.514 --> 01:46.114
Oh-h, boy! Thanks.

01:48.084 --> 01:49.617
Do you mind if I see the ring?

01:49.652 --> 01:51.352
[chuckles]
Is it that obvious?

01:51.421 --> 01:54.055
No, it's--
Yeah.

01:54.090 --> 01:55.323
[chuckles]

01:57.393 --> 01:59.828
Oh, my gosh, it's so pretty.

01:59.863 --> 02:02.396
You have to relax,
she's definitely gonna say yes.

02:02.465 --> 02:04.032
If I can ask her.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.100
This is the third time
I've brought it with me.

02:06.136 --> 02:08.536
You know what? I have an idea.
Why don't we switch tables?

02:08.571 --> 02:09.937
'Cause this one's
way more romantic.

02:10.006 --> 02:12.006
- Are-- Are you serious?
- Yeah, no problem.

02:12.042 --> 02:14.008
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

02:14.044 --> 02:16.644

[door slams]
Cynthia!

02:22.618 --> 02:23.985
- Oh, hey, sweetie.
- Hi, how are you?

02:24.020 --> 02:25.820
Good.
How do you look so handsome?

02:25.856 --> 02:28.923
- Thank you. No booth?
- No, not tonight.

02:28.959 --> 02:30.558
But trust me,
it's for a very good cause.

02:30.593 --> 02:32.126
Okay.

02:32.162 --> 02:33.895
Thank you.

02:33.930 --> 02:36.731
You know, people typically have
dinner first and then dessert?

02:36.766 --> 02:38.967
[chuckling]

02:39.002 --> 02:40.835
Happy anniversary by the way.

02:41.804 --> 02:43.104
"Anniversary?"

02:43.139 --> 02:46.107
No, it's just
five months together.

02:46.176 --> 02:48.743
Actually, um,
I got you something.

02:48.811 --> 02:51.545
Oh, my gosh I was totally
kidding about the anniversary.

02:51.614 --> 02:53.281
Not the anniversary.

02:53.316 --> 02:54.916
It's actually
just a Christmas present.

02:54.951 --> 02:57.085
That's so sweet. But bring it
with us to the farm.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.753
I wanna open it
closer to Christmas.

02:58.788 --> 03:00.554
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

03:00.590 --> 03:03.691
- I'm just not sure about--
- Th-the trip?

03:03.726 --> 03:04.859
Us.

03:04.928 --> 03:06.427
[instrumental music]

03:06.462 --> 03:07.828
Oh.

03:07.898 --> 03:09.130
You're great.

03:09.199 --> 03:10.298
- You're better than great.
- Yeah.

03:10.367 --> 03:11.332
It's just that two weeks

03:11.368 --> 03:12.533
with your family for Christmas--

03:12.568 --> 03:13.534
- Totally.
- It's--

03:13.569 --> 03:15.803
I've...heard it before.

03:15.838 --> 03:17.171
- Cynthia--
- It's fine.

03:17.207 --> 03:20.541
- Don't--
- You're good.

03:20.576 --> 03:22.710
I just wanted say, you guys
are such a beautiful couple

03:22.745 --> 03:24.412
and I hope you have
a really great night.

03:27.017 --> 03:29.617
You know what,
I'm gonna have a cupcake.

03:29.652 --> 03:32.387
And you know what,
it's supposed to snow, so

03:32.422 --> 03:33.888
I don't have any canned food.

03:33.924 --> 03:35.990
Oh, and--

03:38.895 --> 03:41.595
'Night. Merry Christmas.

03:41.631 --> 03:43.664
[instrumental music]

03:43.733 --> 03:45.533
Careful, Paul,
I wouldn't want you hurtin' them

03:45.568 --> 03:47.268
precious fingers of yours.

03:47.337 --> 03:50.238
Oh, they weren't so precious
when I was laying you out.

03:50.307 --> 03:52.640
And what've you done since,
sat around drawin' bunny rabbits

03:52.675 --> 03:54.108
'in those
Felicia Flowers books.'

03:54.144 --> 03:55.609
[laughs]
You jealous?

03:55.645 --> 03:57.445
I drive a forklift,
of course I'm jealous.

04:01.351 --> 04:02.383
Whoo.

04:02.419 --> 04:04.118
[laughing]

04:04.154 --> 04:07.021
Yeah-ha-ha! Good. Okay.

04:07.090 --> 04:08.656
Alright, my phone's ringin',
my phone's ringin'.

04:08.724 --> 04:10.425
[cell phone ringing]

04:12.595 --> 04:14.728
Alright, give me a sec,
it's my boss.

04:14.797 --> 04:18.333
[Liam sighs] It's not even 8 o'clock yet.
What happened?

04:18.368 --> 04:20.301
Take a little guess here.

04:20.337 --> 04:22.803
Christmas, my family, the farm

04:22.872 --> 04:24.905
the travel, everything,
my sister's wedding.

04:24.941 --> 04:26.507
- He bailed out.
- Hmm.

04:26.542 --> 04:29.310
Well, you know, at least
you got a gift out of it.

04:29.346 --> 04:30.478
What's the matter? He couldn't
wait till Christmas?

04:30.513 --> 04:33.281
What was he thinking
with these, like

04:33.316 --> 04:34.548
"Here you go, here's a present

04:34.584 --> 04:37.051
like, in case you forget
you got dumped."

04:40.390 --> 04:41.755
[sighs]

04:41.791 --> 04:45.126
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm good.

04:45.161 --> 04:46.894
I'm, I'm great, you know.

04:46.929 --> 04:49.763
If he can't handle me then,
what good is he, right?

04:49.832 --> 04:54.302
Mm. Look, the right guy,
he's out there somewhere.

04:54.337 --> 04:55.636
I want it to work out.

04:57.407 --> 05:01.376
I have to say though, I do have
pretty high expectations.

05:01.411 --> 05:04.278
My parents, they do--

05:04.314 --> 05:07.648
They, they did...so many sweet--

05:07.683 --> 05:09.583
...and/or lot of romantic things
for one another.

05:12.522 --> 05:15.423
So, um--
What are you gonna tell Janet?

05:15.492 --> 05:18.826
- She's expecting a plus one.
- I'll bring in a plus one.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.895
I'm not going stag to my little
sister's wedding.

05:22.065 --> 05:24.399
- Anyone I know?
- You might.

05:26.669 --> 05:29.037
You are so lucky
that I did not have plans.

05:29.072 --> 05:31.672
You're lucky, you get to spend
two wonderful weeks with me.

05:31.741 --> 05:33.908
Besides we do have a deadline
on the book.

05:33.943 --> 05:35.876
It's the first Christmas since
you're mom passed away.

05:35.912 --> 05:37.512
You sure I'm not gonna be
in the way?

05:37.547 --> 05:39.313
My dad loves the company,
the more, the merrier.

05:39.349 --> 05:41.949
Besides, you cannot be alone
on Christmas.

05:41.984 --> 05:44.118
I...wasn't gonna be alone.

05:45.255 --> 05:46.887
- Mm-hmm.
- Necessarily.

05:46.923 --> 05:48.189
(Cynthia)
Uh-huh?

05:52.828 --> 05:54.929
You know, I date, alright.
There was Maggie.

05:54.964 --> 05:57.465
I'm talkin' about someone
in the past decade.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.300
You know, I don't tell you
everything.

05:59.369 --> 06:01.102
[chuckles] I would know if
you were seeing someone.

06:01.171 --> 06:02.503
- Oh, you would, would you?
- You'd be happier.

06:02.539 --> 06:04.338
You'd have a little pep
in your step.

06:04.374 --> 06:07.442
[chuckling]
Oh, yeah.

06:07.477 --> 06:09.277
At least you haven't
screwed up, literally

06:09.312 --> 06:11.212
five relationships in two years.

06:12.848 --> 06:14.915
- R-R-Ronaldo.
- No! Stop!

06:14.984 --> 06:16.250
[Liam laughs]

06:16.319 --> 06:17.518
- He doesn't count.
- Why not?

06:18.654 --> 06:20.121
'Cause I can't handle two hands.

06:20.156 --> 06:21.956
[laughs]
Let's go.

06:24.461 --> 06:26.394
[instrumental music]

06:26.429 --> 06:29.330
(Cynthia) 'You know what, I need this.
Two weeks, no drama.'

06:29.365 --> 06:32.333
'Like, we'll finish the new
book, spend time with my dad'

06:32.368 --> 06:34.635
'get Janet married,
and start the new year fresh.'

06:34.670 --> 06:36.904
You'll see, everything
is gonna be so perfect.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.640
[siren wailing]

06:42.011 --> 06:45.113
(Cynthia)
'It gets dirty right after this.'

06:45.148 --> 06:47.047
(Liam) 'You weren't going that fast,
were you, Cynthia?'

06:47.083 --> 06:49.417
Don't really think that's why
I'm gettin' pulled over.

06:50.886 --> 06:51.986
[sighs]

06:56.459 --> 06:58.792
[instrumental music]

06:58.828 --> 07:01.729
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

07:01.764 --> 07:02.997
Hey, Scott. I'm so sorry.

07:03.032 --> 07:04.632
Was I,
was I speeding or something?

07:04.667 --> 07:06.200
What?

07:06.236 --> 07:07.968
Oh, who knows.

07:08.004 --> 07:09.903
Radar gun's been busted
since July.

07:11.341 --> 07:13.941
- Just wanted to say hi.
- Hi.

07:14.010 --> 07:15.876
Hello. Ha ha.

07:15.911 --> 07:17.211
It's good to have you back,
Cindy.

07:17.247 --> 07:18.479
It's great to be back.

07:18.515 --> 07:20.648
Hey, who's this?

07:20.683 --> 07:22.082
- You married now?
- No, no.

07:22.118 --> 07:24.452
He's my working--
He's my work friend.

07:24.487 --> 07:27.255
He's my friend. We wo--
I work with him.

07:27.290 --> 07:29.790
- Ah.
- Liam. Hi.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.559
- I draw pictures.
- Mm-hmm.

07:31.628 --> 07:34.262
I'm gonna need to see
some ID, stranger.

07:34.297 --> 07:36.697
- I'm just kidding. Ha ha ha.
- Oh.

07:36.732 --> 07:39.200
'You'd be surprised how
people fall for that though.'

07:39.235 --> 07:42.069
- Probably because you're a cop.
- Yeah.

07:42.138 --> 07:43.604
This has just been so fun.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.473
Um, but we,
we actually have to head out

07:45.508 --> 07:46.907
and, uh,
go meet up with my family.

07:46.942 --> 07:48.776
Oh, you're right. Right, yeah.

07:48.811 --> 07:50.744
You know
I saw Janet the other day.

07:50.780 --> 07:51.945
She said
you'd be comin' into town

07:52.014 --> 07:54.415
to, uh--
How'd she put it?

07:54.484 --> 07:57.084
- Screw up the wedding?
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

07:57.119 --> 07:59.787
She, uh, gets a little annoyed
with my enthusiasm for weddings.

07:59.822 --> 08:01.255
'Yeah, it's gonna be,
it's gonna be great.'

08:01.291 --> 08:02.256
'I can't wait for you
to see it.'

08:02.292 --> 08:04.058
Yeah.

08:04.093 --> 08:05.893
Alright, well, um--

08:05.928 --> 08:09.129
We should, uh, get together.
You know, hang out.

08:09.165 --> 08:10.964
Catch up, maybe grab a coffee
or somethin'.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.400
Yeah, that would be--

08:12.435 --> 08:15.403
I'm so busy,
but...that would be great.

08:15.438 --> 08:17.805
That would be great, yeah.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.373
Okay.

08:19.409 --> 08:21.975
Well, uh...drive safe.

08:22.011 --> 08:24.312
Okay.
See you later, officer.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.947
- Bye.
- See ya.

08:27.016 --> 08:29.083
I thought small town cops
were supposed to be paunchy.

08:29.151 --> 08:30.484
Is he like, your ex-boyfriend?

08:30.520 --> 08:31.985
No, he's my first boyfriend
actually.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.354
But he would
always like wanna re-watch

08:33.423 --> 08:34.822
his football games
from the night before.

08:34.857 --> 08:36.624
And yet you still let him
call you Cindy.

08:36.659 --> 08:39.727
- Ha ha. The guy has a Taser.
- Fair enough.

- This is a nice place.
- It's great.

09:04.987 --> 09:06.554
It's just there's usually
so many more lights.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.522
- We could take care of that.
- Yeah.

09:08.558 --> 09:09.923
I'm gonna go
tell my dad we're here.

09:09.959 --> 09:12.627
So just go inside,
I'm sure Janet's there.

09:12.662 --> 09:15.028
Ha. Janet.

[bells chiming]

Dad!

09:34.216 --> 09:37.285
You're the best. Thank you
so much for doing that.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.688
Liam! Why didn't you go inside?

09:40.723 --> 09:43.457

I do not drive men away.

don't drink eggnog.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.653
On that note,
I think I'll say goodnight.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.021
Oh, you're the best.
Goodnight, daddy.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.731
So, Rodge, Christmas wedding.

18:36.766 --> 18:39.333
I mean, that's,
that's pretty romantic, right?

18:39.369 --> 18:41.435
Oh, really, it's the only
sensible choice.

18:41.471 --> 18:44.304
People have the day off,
families are already together.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.874
And bridal registries make
gift shopping very convenient.

18:48.911 --> 18:51.178
- Convenient.
- Hmm.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.446
- Smooth, huh.
- Yeah, okay.

18:52.482 --> 18:55.082
- So it's not Roger.
- Told you so.

18:55.117 --> 18:56.316
Yeah, you did.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.118
[instrumental music]

18:58.187 --> 18:59.854
- 'Okay, this isn't a studio.'
- 'Ha ha ha.'

18:59.889 --> 19:01.154
But at least-- Ha! Okay.

19:01.190 --> 19:02.356
Well, now we can
get some work done.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.324
We have a Christmas book
to write.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.026
This is new territory for us.
Right?

19:06.095 --> 19:07.795
This is new territory
for Felicia.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.897
What does her magic
do to Christmas?

19:09.932 --> 19:11.832
What does her magic
do to Christmas?

19:14.169 --> 19:16.203
Here are some
Christmasy things.

19:16.272 --> 19:18.439
Oh, oh, oh, maybe, um

19:18.474 --> 19:20.408
maybe the eggnog
is served out of--

19:20.443 --> 19:21.809
...you know, really big tulips.

19:21.878 --> 19:23.911
Right? That would be
really pretty I think.

19:23.946 --> 19:27.782
And the tree has, like, uh,
a crystal, uh, pine cone

19:27.817 --> 19:28.883
that acts like a disco ball.

19:28.951 --> 19:30.818
Yes. Oh, that's gorgeous!

19:30.853 --> 19:32.286
I love that. Oh, my gosh, Liam.

19:34.056 --> 19:35.255
It's the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.691
Maybe the toys
come alive at night

19:37.727 --> 19:40.160
and they re-decorate
the entire house. Hmm?

19:40.195 --> 19:42.195
Oh, and there has to be tinsel
on everything

19:42.264 --> 19:44.164
that's really important
and blinking lights, all of it.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.466
It's gonna be gorgeous.

19:45.501 --> 19:47.067
Okay, okay,
slow down, slow down--

19:47.102 --> 19:50.638
No, no, you need to draw faster,
I'm on a roll.

19:50.673 --> 19:54.174
Oh-ho, maybe the, um, maybe the
toys think that she is a doll

19:54.209 --> 19:55.476
so they wrap her up
in wrappin' paper.

19:55.511 --> 19:57.144
Well, can't she just
rip her way out?

19:57.212 --> 19:59.547
No, she's gonna be tied up with
ribbons, so she can't get up.

19:59.582 --> 20:02.883
You know-- Oh! And then she sees
an elf in the fireplace.

20:06.856 --> 20:09.590
[instrumental music]

20:16.866 --> 20:18.799
[chuckles]

20:20.069 --> 20:21.635
Wow.

20:21.671 --> 20:23.471
Wow.

20:28.377 --> 20:30.310
I, uh--

20:30.346 --> 20:32.680
This was my mom's.

20:32.748 --> 20:35.148
It was way too big for me
when I was a kid.

20:36.886 --> 20:38.853
When I was growing up,
I used to put it on--

20:40.623 --> 20:45.459
...and think about my perfect
wedding, perfect romance

20:45.495 --> 20:47.394
perfect husband. Ha!

20:47.429 --> 20:50.831
Well, at least now you're past
all that pie in the sky stuff.

20:50.867 --> 20:53.367
You can make fun of me
all you want.

20:55.137 --> 20:57.104
But when I was growing up
all I ever really wanted

20:57.139 --> 21:00.541
was the kind of romance
my mom and dad had, you know?

21:00.576 --> 21:03.878
They were married
for forty years

21:03.913 --> 21:05.613
and they still did all these--

21:05.648 --> 21:07.381
Planned little surprises
for each other.

21:07.416 --> 21:09.416
[chuckles]
I mean--

21:10.720 --> 21:12.753
They were the real deal.

21:12.788 --> 21:15.756
[inhales deeply]
Hey, I-I'm really sorry.

21:15.825 --> 21:18.025
- Oh! God--
- 'Yeah, I-I didn't mean to--'

21:18.060 --> 21:21.061
No, I'm so sorry,
I'm so embarrassed.

21:21.096 --> 21:22.596
- Hey, it's okay, it's okay.
- Um--

21:22.632 --> 21:25.533
- I just, I got nostalgic.
- Yeah.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.271
- So, uh, book.
- Yes!

21:31.306 --> 21:33.440

Oh, w-we have such a deadline.

Okay, I'm gonna, um--

I-If you don't mind I just wanna
go show this to Janet.

21:40.182 --> 21:43.316
But I'll be right back.
I think she'll love this.

21:43.352 --> 21:44.418
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

21:44.453 --> 21:46.453
I'm gonna bring coffee.
So, get!

21:46.488 --> 21:48.789
I gave you a lot of things
to work on. So, go.

21:48.858 --> 21:50.290
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.961
- Janet!
- 'Uh-huh?'

21:53.996 --> 21:56.296
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:56.331 --> 21:59.266
Look what I found. You're never
gonna guess where it was.

21:59.301 --> 22:01.902
Upstairs in the closet, in a box
marked "Mom's wedding gown?"

22:01.938 --> 22:04.504
Okay. Yeah, yeah, maybe you'll
guess exactly where it was.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.639
[chuckling]

22:05.675 --> 22:06.974
It's all in the inventory.

22:07.009 --> 22:08.341
You gotta get that
to the dry cleaners.

22:08.377 --> 22:10.177
You can't go wearing
a dusty gown.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.479
No, Cynthia, I already,
I already have a dress.

22:14.116 --> 22:17.651
You bought a gown without me
there to advise you?

22:17.687 --> 22:20.253
No, I picked out a dress.

22:20.289 --> 22:22.422
It's sensible, you know,
it's, it's great.

22:22.458 --> 22:24.324
Somethin' that I can wear again
to, like, parties and stuff.

22:24.393 --> 22:26.259
What? What do you mean
wear it to parties?

22:26.295 --> 22:27.661
A wedding dress
is meant to be worn

22:27.697 --> 22:29.096
one time,
that's the whole point of it.

22:29.131 --> 22:32.432
Well, mom already wore it once,
so, there you go.

say that she would--

I'm not--

think about it.

- It's really pretty.
- I hid it.

the presents.

in the city, I suppose. Why?

does not carry turtle doves.

Right? I called around,
they don't have them anywhere

'cause they're not native here,
you actually have to get

26:47.725 --> 26:49.525

just to import them.

"McPherson's special events."

37:10.214 --> 37:12.214
and butterscotts and all that.

37:12.249 --> 37:14.515
- Butterscotts?
- Butterscotch?

37:14.551 --> 37:17.485
- You said "Scotts."
- No, I didn't. Did I?

37:17.520 --> 37:19.888
- Yeah.
- Gosh! I'm, I'm losing my mind.

37:19.923 --> 37:22.224
Well, uh, alright.
Well, that covers the wedding.

37:22.259 --> 37:25.927
Now all I have to do is figure
out what to get your pops.

37:25.996 --> 37:28.063
- What?
- It's just really sweet.

37:28.131 --> 37:29.764
I pulled this whole trip on you
very last minute

37:29.799 --> 37:32.600
and now you're gonna
get a present for my dad.

37:32.635 --> 37:34.369
It's very thoughtful.

37:34.404 --> 37:36.371
Yeah, well,
I guess this whole

37:36.406 --> 37:38.673
Christmas present craze
is rubbing off on me.

37:38.708 --> 37:41.176
Well, if there's anybody else
you need to shop for

37:41.211 --> 37:43.478
I'm totally fine
just to go back in.

37:43.513 --> 37:44.913
- Yeah? Nah.
- Poking my ears.

37:44.948 --> 37:47.215
- Already got something for you.
- What? You did?

37:47.251 --> 37:49.751
- Ah.
- Can you just give me a hint?

37:49.819 --> 37:53.221
- 'Nope.'
- Okay.

37:53.290 --> 37:55.757
(Cynthia) 'So, do you think
that maybe Janet could be-- '

37:55.792 --> 37:57.425
- No.
- You didn't let me finish.

37:57.460 --> 37:58.426
Oh, I'm so sorry.

37:58.461 --> 37:59.761
I'm sorry.
Please, continue.

37:59.796 --> 38:01.229
Do you think that
she could be right

38:01.265 --> 38:03.564
about Scott being
the one behind the gifts?

38:03.633 --> 38:06.701
Oh, oh, in that case, uh, no.

38:06.770 --> 38:08.803
It'd be sort of cute.
Wouldn't it?

38:08.838 --> 38:10.538
If we were, like,
high school sweethearts

38:10.573 --> 38:13.041
that got back together
after all these years apart.

38:13.076 --> 38:15.510
Yeah. Meh.

38:19.416 --> 38:21.316
It's not you sending
the presents, right?

38:24.221 --> 38:25.420
You got me.

38:25.455 --> 38:26.421
[laughs]

38:28.892 --> 38:30.458
No, it's not.

38:30.493 --> 38:33.594
- Why would I do that?
- I think I'm gonna call Scott.

38:33.630 --> 38:38.266
- Just, like...call him.
- Yeah.

38:49.879 --> 38:51.413

38:58.322 --> 39:00.388
Finally, a gift
I can get behind.

39:00.424 --> 39:02.690
- Swans swimming in champagne.
- I know.

39:02.725 --> 39:03.858
Thanks, dad.

39:03.893 --> 39:05.293
- For you.
- Alright.

39:05.329 --> 39:07.595
And <i>moi.</i>

39:07.630 --> 39:11.466
Alright.
A toast.

used to make every year.'

39:13.870 --> 39:17.305

Past, present and future.

39:17.341 --> 39:21.509
May you forever be held in our
hearts if not in our hands."

Can you believe it

39:26.249 --> 39:28.016
Scott still has
the same phone number?

39:28.051 --> 39:29.851
Oh, well you know,
he's never left this town

39:29.886 --> 39:31.319
so, why would he
ever change it?

39:31.355 --> 39:33.121
It's just crazy, like,
some things change too much

39:33.156 --> 39:34.122
some things stay the same.

39:34.157 --> 39:35.256
(Liam)
Yeah.

39:35.292 --> 39:36.958
Scott's gonna take me
out tonight.

39:37.027 --> 39:38.026
- Tonight?
- Yeah!

39:38.061 --> 39:39.494
We have plans tonight.

39:39.529 --> 39:41.696
Well, work plans.
Like, what about the book?

39:41.731 --> 39:43.698
Oh, my gosh,
Liam, I'm so sorry.

39:43.766 --> 39:45.333
I'm sorry, but we're gonna
get to it, I promise.

39:45.402 --> 39:48.403
It's just suddenly I have a
really good feeling about Scott.

39:50.173 --> 39:51.506
Third time is a charm.

39:51.541 --> 39:53.074
You guys want some water?

39:53.143 --> 39:55.276
Well, I guess I'll have
some dinner with your dad.

39:56.513 --> 39:58.579
Hi, ladies.
Ah, ah.

39:58.615 --> 40:00.415
- Oh, Oh!
- 'Ow! The chicken--'

40:00.450 --> 40:03.151
- Run for the hills, girls!
- Liam, they're escaping.

40:03.186 --> 40:05.653
[Liam imitates clucking]

40:05.688 --> 40:06.687
- Ow!
- Oh.

40:10.760 --> 40:12.560
- Hi
- Hi.

40:13.630 --> 40:15.563
The chickens are escaping.

40:15.598 --> 40:16.764
Really?

40:16.799 --> 40:18.500
The chickens are escaping!

40:21.571 --> 40:24.139
Oh, you wouldn't believe
how fast a French chick can run.

40:24.207 --> 40:27.108
[laughs] Oh, yeah. The important
thing is you got 'em all back.

40:27.177 --> 40:28.243
Hm.

40:31.548 --> 40:32.747
[sighs]

40:32.782 --> 40:33.814
So, how come you're not spending

40:33.850 --> 40:35.116
Christmas with your girlfriend?

40:36.619 --> 40:38.619
I, um, I don't have one.

40:43.060 --> 40:45.293
Would you like some advice
about strategy?

40:45.328 --> 40:47.795
I played this game before,
you know?

40:47.830 --> 40:49.397
Marie and I played every night.

40:49.433 --> 40:51.599
I bet you won
every game, too, right?

40:51.668 --> 40:52.767
Only if she'd let me.

40:52.835 --> 40:54.702
[laughs]

40:54.737 --> 40:56.304
What can you do?

40:56.339 --> 40:58.005
There's only ever
one thing to do.

40:58.075 --> 41:00.241
- What's that?
- Make a move.

41:03.380 --> 41:05.380
Probably gonna regret this.

41:13.290 --> 41:14.289
Checkmate.

41:14.357 --> 41:16.991
[laughs]

41:17.026 --> 41:20.328
Well, you...make the wrong move
and you lose, right?

41:22.499 --> 41:24.466
At least you tried.

41:27.070 --> 41:29.737
- Hey, you look lovely.
- Aw, thanks, dad.

41:29.806 --> 41:31.706
(Cynthia)
See you later.

41:31.774 --> 41:34.242
- Hi!
- Wow.

Playing a little chess?

41:35.778 --> 41:36.777
I've been trying to.

41:36.813 --> 41:38.679
He's so good.

41:38.715 --> 41:41.048
So, my gentleman caller's
gonna be here any minute.

41:41.084 --> 41:43.151
Here we go again, huh?

41:43.186 --> 41:45.420
You can go ahead and tell me
why you think it's not Scott.

41:46.789 --> 41:48.923
I don't know, might be.
So what?

41:48.958 --> 41:51.192
You spent the first few days
here talking about

41:51.228 --> 41:54.629
how you and Scott
didn't...have anything.

41:54.664 --> 41:56.797
It was a long time ago.
Maybe he's changed, right?

41:56.833 --> 41:58.899
- I mean, we were kids.
- Okay, you know what?

41:58.935 --> 42:00.801
I think you deserve a little bit
more than a bunch of clichés.

42:00.837 --> 42:01.869
[doorbell rings]

42:01.904 --> 42:03.104
Liam, why are you doing this?

42:03.140 --> 42:04.372
Now I'm about to go on a date.

42:04.407 --> 42:06.341
Well, I'm sorry,
it's just that I--

42:06.376 --> 42:08.276
I care about you,
and I worry about you.

42:09.679 --> 42:10.978

yourself out there

42:11.014 --> 42:12.347

I got to admit
something, Scott

43:33.207 --> 43:35.808
growing up, I really did not
peg you for a law man.

43:35.844 --> 43:39.278

of a criminal element

58:39.646 --> 58:41.746
- And we're all out of coffee.
- Ooh.

58:43.183 --> 58:45.716
- So, good date?
- Mm-hmm.

58:45.785 --> 58:47.953
- Yeah?
- Straight up.

58:47.988 --> 58:50.488
- Maggie seems so sweet.
- Yeah, yeah.

58:51.959 --> 58:53.858
Yeah, I don't think
it's gonna work out.

58:53.893 --> 58:55.526
Really?

58:55.562 --> 58:57.862
I thought you've been carrying
a torch for her all these years.

58:57.897 --> 59:00.665
For Maggie? No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

59:00.700 --> 59:02.400
And besides you have enough

59:02.436 --> 59:05.403
romantic drama
for the both of us.

59:05.439 --> 59:07.272
Well, that is all behind me now.

59:09.476 --> 59:11.509
Settling on Scott, huh?

59:11.544 --> 59:13.144
[sighs]

59:13.180 --> 59:15.313
If you'd told me that two weeks
ago I would have been, like

59:15.382 --> 59:18.549
"What? You're crazy."

59:18.585 --> 59:21.052
Does that really make any sense?

59:21.088 --> 59:22.988
That's kind of the only thing
that makes sense--

59:23.023 --> 59:24.456
...if that makes sense.

59:24.491 --> 59:27.993
I mean, who cares
if it makes sense, right?

59:28.061 --> 59:29.627
As long as you're happy.

59:32.699 --> 59:35.600
You are such a good friend.

59:35.635 --> 59:37.835
A crazy good friend.

59:42.575 --> 59:44.642
You're not too bad, yourself.

59:44.677 --> 59:46.044
Thank you--

59:47.780 --> 59:49.447
...for everything.

59:49.483 --> 59:50.648
Yeah.

you promised, no comment.'

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:01.887
'Okay, you ready?'

01:00:01.922 --> 01:00:03.289
Yes, I'm ready.

01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:13.599
What do you think?

01:00:13.668 --> 01:00:16.802
It's, um, it's,
it's really pretty. It's--

01:00:16.837 --> 01:00:19.639
- Oh, you hate it.
- No, I don't--

01:00:19.674 --> 01:00:22.040
I don't hate-- It's just,
it's your wedding, Janet.

01:00:22.076 --> 01:00:23.676
I know,
but I'm not a princess.

01:00:23.711 --> 01:00:26.312
I'm not a little girl,
I'm not you. This is who I am.

01:00:26.347 --> 01:00:28.714
I don't care about the dresses
and the parties and the presents

01:00:28.783 --> 01:00:31.250
I just want,
like, a simple, quiet

01:00:31.286 --> 01:00:32.951
nice relationship
with my husband.

01:00:32.987 --> 01:00:34.887

why you don't get that.'

I hear you, but it's--

01:00:38.393 --> 01:00:41.226
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.

01:00:41.296 --> 01:00:45.431
This is your day.
This is your big day, and I--

01:00:45.466 --> 01:00:47.099
You should do what you want.

01:00:47.134 --> 01:00:50.169
You're gonna look so amazing
in whatever you wear.

That was--

01:01:02.684 --> 01:01:06.185
- That was amazing.
- Wow! That was terrific, yeah!

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.986
Well, listen,
it's cold out here

01:01:08.022 --> 01:01:09.588
so, uh, I'll tell you what.

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.924
'Um, we have a wedding to get
ready for tomorrow'

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:15.328
and I could use a little help,
so, the way I see it

01:01:15.363 --> 01:01:17.330
you can hang around
out here all day

go inside for a nice

help me set up the venue.

Hello. Howdy.

for eleven people.

made wine-tasting
reservations for Tuesday.

01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:10.583
I'm gonna make this brief.
Janet, you are amazing.

You are everything
I have ever wanted and more--

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:16.655
You know, this has just been
such a special two weeks

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:19.792
I feel like, maybe you should
call off the grand finale.

01:02:19.827 --> 01:02:22.294
Like, I would love it, but
Janet's a little bit on edge.

01:02:22.329 --> 01:02:24.530
I feel, like, you know,
it might kind of interfere

01:02:24.565 --> 01:02:26.064
with the ceremony,
you know what I mean?

01:02:27.435 --> 01:02:28.834
Yeah.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.569
...soon we'll be

No, I get it, you don't want
twelve pipers piping

in the middle of their vows.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.994
Sorry. What?

01:02:58.299 --> 01:02:59.998
The noise--

01:03:00.067 --> 01:03:02.234

- Why don't you sing it?

01:03:36.504 --> 01:03:40.238
- You mean, right-right now?
- Mm-hmm, yep. Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:42.076 --> 01:03:44.176

you were this romantic and--

to figure it out, Liam.

01:07:16.857 --> 01:07:20.059
But you were the one
who sent me the gifts.

to play along.

It couldn't have been
anybody else.

01:07:28.736 --> 01:07:30.435
Why, because there's
nobody else left?

01:07:32.073 --> 01:07:33.572
Is that the reason
that you're here?

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.140
You're making it sound--

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:37.109
You think that I came here
for two weeks

01:07:37.144 --> 01:07:39.311
with your family
just to work on a book?

01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:42.014

- Come on, Cynthia.

finally gonna see

01:07:48.989 --> 01:07:50.655

I-I can't do this anymore.

a bus out of here tomorrow.

there was something wrong

a little bit of Cynthia drama.

It's just something
I-I was thinking about--

01:09:10.984 --> 01:09:12.183
...for our honeymoon.

01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:14.219
Okay, Roger,
we talked about this.

I can't leave him here alone.
I can't leave town.

01:09:19.593 --> 01:09:22.093

can manage for a week

01:09:23.596 --> 01:09:26.598

'Even he wants you to go.'

01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:30.736
Cynthia infected you

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:32.270
I don't like it.
It's messy, okay?

01:09:32.305 --> 01:09:34.372

what's not real.'

Janet--

01:09:37.545 --> 01:09:38.676
You're-you're stressed
about the wedding.

01:09:38.712 --> 01:09:40.312
I'm not stressed
about the wedding.

01:09:40.346 --> 01:09:42.747
I'm stressed because I'm trying
to keep this family together

01:09:42.783 --> 01:09:44.049

ruining everything.

01:09:44.084 --> 01:09:45.684
That's the problem.

01:09:53.093 --> 01:09:55.928
- What happened?
- Roger's being crazy.

01:09:55.963 --> 01:09:58.697
He, like, planned
this whole secret honeymoon

01:09:58.732 --> 01:10:01.399

01:10:01.469 --> 01:10:03.969
And that's terrible?

Of course, you would think
it's cool, it's like--

01:10:06.674 --> 01:10:09.541
...presents and romantic
getaways. Ugh!

01:10:09.577 --> 01:10:11.109
You know what, Janet,
a little bit of that

01:10:11.178 --> 01:10:12.478
is not such a bad thing,
you know.

01:10:12.513 --> 01:10:13.979
It doesn't have to be, like

01:10:14.014 --> 01:10:15.514
this and this all the time.

01:10:15.549 --> 01:10:18.283
But, every now and again
it could be really fun.

01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:22.053
You're so much like mom,
it's actually insane.

01:10:22.089 --> 01:10:25.691
Aww. That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

01:10:25.726 --> 01:10:28.660
I just don't really have
any of that in me, you know?

01:10:28.696 --> 01:10:29.828
Like, when I said yes
to Roger

01:10:29.864 --> 01:10:33.231
I said yes because
that makes sense.

01:10:33.266 --> 01:10:37.469
We're friends, we get along,
and he's really good to me.

to be happy.

When mom passed away,
it was, like, awful to see dad

01:10:56.957 --> 01:10:59.290
like, this light just went out
in his life and, like, I just--

01:11:01.795 --> 01:11:04.496
I can't imagine living
like that, you know?

01:11:04.532 --> 01:11:07.900
You wanna go your whole life
without that kind of connection

01:11:07.935 --> 01:11:10.235

Yeah, I don't know,
I don't know.

01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:17.976
I just don't wanna
do that to Roger.

01:11:20.213 --> 01:11:22.147

fell in love.

01:11:43.904 --> 01:11:45.571
I realized

01:11:46.974 --> 01:11:49.474
we didn't have
what mom and dad had.

01:11:49.509 --> 01:11:50.876

don't have what

01:11:50.911 --> 01:11:52.945

are lucky enough to have.

stop chasing the romance.
