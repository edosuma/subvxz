00:01.740 --> 00:03.133
Previously, onLucifer...My dad screwed us both.

00:03.177 --> 00:05.179
But perhaps there's a way

00:05.222 --> 00:06.832
for us to screw him back.How?

00:06.876 --> 00:07.920
By killing you.

00:07.964 --> 00:09.879
Amenadiel's nice.If he were nice,

00:09.922 --> 00:12.621
he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend,

00:12.664 --> 00:13.622
and lying about it.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.189
You know, don't you?

00:15.232 --> 00:16.625
You're the ones
who have been

00:16.668 --> 00:19.062
lying to me about
this fling for weeks.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.063
I'd like to try and help.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.717
You don't have to treat me.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.458
I think I do.
For both of us.

00:23.501 --> 00:24.894
LUCIFER:
In my quest to help you die,

00:24.937 --> 00:26.113
I've done some research.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.549
I've read every book,

00:27.592 --> 00:28.811
I've analyzed every language.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.508
LUCIFER:
I'm completely out of ideas.

00:30.552 --> 00:31.640
We can't rewrite history.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.816
Detective, you're a genius.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.426
You've just given me my idea.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.125
LUCIFER:
Once upon a time,

00:38.168 --> 00:41.519
there were two brothers--
Kane and Abel.

00:41.563 --> 00:45.262
They fought, as brothers often
do, over everything.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.264
What's that supposed to be?
Are we shaking hands

00:47.308 --> 00:48.918
or holding spiders?

00:48.961 --> 00:51.181
[chuckles]
That's you and your brother

00:51.225 --> 00:53.488
pummeling each other
over a pet rock.

00:53.531 --> 00:57.361
And here's you two scamps
tugging on both ends of a snake.

00:57.405 --> 00:58.623
That's not how it happened.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.930
Well, artistic license,
my friend.

01:00.973 --> 01:04.194
The point is that you were
always at each other's throats.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.370
Until...
[sniffs]

01:06.414 --> 01:08.851
...you fought to the death.

01:08.894 --> 01:11.506
You killed Abel

01:11.549 --> 01:13.943
and became the world's

01:13.986 --> 01:15.075
first murderer.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.120
Now, the part where
my father marks you,

01:17.164 --> 01:19.514
cursing you to walk the earth
for eternity,

01:19.557 --> 01:21.211
it's tricky to draw.Now, um,

01:21.255 --> 01:23.300
I've heard this one before--
the ending sucks.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.128
My point exactly.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.478
We all know how your story ends.

01:27.522 --> 01:31.482
But what if we change
how it begins?

01:33.136 --> 01:36.096
What if you never killed Abel?

01:36.139 --> 01:38.968
What if we did...

01:39.011 --> 01:40.274
this?

01:40.317 --> 01:41.536
Clean slate.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.320
That's impossible.
How would we do that?

01:43.364 --> 01:44.321
Oh, simple.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.151
I shall fly down to Hell,

01:48.195 --> 01:51.546
pluck your brother's soul, and
drop it into a vacant body.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.852
This would make Abel
technically alive,

01:53.896 --> 01:57.073
and therefore not murdered,
and you innocent.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.250
Wait, back up.
My brother is in Hell?

02:00.294 --> 02:02.339
Yes, of course.
In fact, he's our oldest tenant.

02:02.383 --> 02:05.603
I knew it. Do you know how many
times I've tried to tell people

02:05.647 --> 02:07.518
Abel is the asshat?
No one ever believes me.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.259
Right, can we just focus
on my genius plan?

02:09.303 --> 02:11.392
If we bring Abel
back to life,

02:11.435 --> 02:13.437
that would erase your crime.

02:13.481 --> 02:18.268
No crime, no mark,
no curse.

02:18.312 --> 02:21.967
You'd be mortal
and can finally die.

02:23.491 --> 02:24.927
PIERCE:
This one's good.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.973
Oh, this one's
even better.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.888
Yeah, a bit past its
sell-by date, I'm afraid.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.499
Wait till Abel
wakes up in this body.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.543
I never thought
I'd say this,

02:32.587 --> 02:34.371
but slow down, Lieutenant.

02:34.415 --> 02:37.592
Time to lay down some
soul-dropping rules,

02:37.635 --> 02:39.202
or what I think the rules are,
at least.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.725
You have done this
before, right?

02:40.769 --> 02:44.860
Not exactly, but based
on a sample size of, uh,

02:44.903 --> 02:46.862
one crooked cop
and one goddess,

02:46.905 --> 02:50.039
I can only drop a soul into
someone who's recently died.

02:50.082 --> 02:50.866
How recent?

02:50.909 --> 02:52.172
The instant after death.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.477
So we need a fresh one.

02:53.521 --> 02:54.652
How are we gonna find that?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.524
Hey, guys?

02:56.567 --> 02:58.395
There's been an explosion
at a high-rise downtown.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.658
There's one dead at the scene,
one on the way to the ICU.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.225
Oh, that's promising.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.227
Excuse me?
PIERCE: He means
that's a promising chance

03:04.271 --> 03:05.750
to question the witness
at the hospital.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.056
Mm. Yes,

03:07.099 --> 03:09.319
where loads of people
are on the brink of death.

03:09.363 --> 03:12.714
So you want to question
someone who's unconscious

03:12.757 --> 03:14.759
and in critical condition?

03:14.803 --> 03:16.935
The witness may recover,
have some intel.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.502
Can't hurt to check.Hmm.

03:18.546 --> 03:22.332
Okay, we'll work
the crime scene.

came by messenger.

And, uh, an assistant opened the

Right, well, if we pop Abel

I have dropped him?

one teeny mistake.

18:39.901 --> 18:42.164
Over and over.

18:42.208 --> 18:46.037
And there's nothing
I can do to avoid it.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.865
I've tried everything.

18:47.909 --> 18:52.348
Fighting him, running from him,
all in vain.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.915
I'm trapped.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.613
I can never escape.

18:57.658 --> 18:58.876
You're right, Abel.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.183
You can't fight him.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.490
But I may have a way
out of this for you.

19:08.756 --> 19:12.803
You want me to kill myself?

19:12.847 --> 19:14.675
Well, I've never tried
that before.

19:16.111 --> 19:19.201
How many more strip clubs
are we going to search?

19:19.245 --> 19:20.855
Why, as many as it takes.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.987
What would I and
therefore Abel do next?

19:23.031 --> 19:24.467
Keep up the fun, obviously.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.077
Well, we just spent
the last half hour

19:26.121 --> 19:27.775
wandering past billboards
of women's lingerie.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.037
And your problem is?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.386
"Problems," plural.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.996
One: no sign of Abel,

19:32.040 --> 19:34.695
two: we have no idea what we're
gonna do even if we find him.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.566
Well, speak for yourself,
Negative Nelly, 'cause I think

19:36.610 --> 19:38.089
I've worked out exactly
what we need to do.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.700
Wait, you have?
Yes.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.397
Well, Dad's an old school kind
of guy, right?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.051
Eye for an eye, and all that?

19:43.094 --> 19:47.098
You killed Abel, so in order to
make things truly even-steven...

19:47.142 --> 19:49.231
Abel has to kill me.Mm-hmm.

19:49.275 --> 19:50.798
It does make sense.

19:50.841 --> 19:54.323
So which way do you think
you're headed?

19:54.367 --> 19:55.542
Once you finally pop off.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.935
Pearly gates or
blazing inferno?

19:57.979 --> 19:59.546
Be ironic if you went to all
this trouble

19:59.589 --> 20:01.025
just to end up in a Hell loop.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.245
I'd never punish myself
like that.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.639
Hell is all about your own guilt
torturing you, right?

20:05.682 --> 20:06.944
Right.
Well,

20:06.988 --> 20:08.903
my conscience is clear.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.252
Oh.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.601
Killing your brother
isn't the kind of thing

20:11.645 --> 20:12.907
you just shake off.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.474
Listen, Abel wanted
to kill me just as much

20:14.517 --> 20:15.823
as I wanted to kill him.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.303
Why do you think he'sin Hell?

20:17.346 --> 20:20.001
I'm just the guy
who won the fight.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.309
Hello.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.659
Where would I
and therefore Abel go next?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.133
All right. Ella got back to me

21:05.176 --> 21:07.091
It was made from fertilizer
that's banned in the U.S.,

it's still being used.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.007
Bolivia? No way.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.618
Yeah. So I took a closer
look into Alexa's company

21:11.661 --> 21:14.011
to see if I could prove
a Bolivian connection.

21:14.055 --> 21:15.448
Uh-huh.

She's got a lot
of international financiers,

the Bolivian ones.

And I told you
Father cursed Kane for a reason.

You actually thought
that I would just

to tail the target
of my investigation,

24:14.757 --> 24:16.280

Before it turns into
a public gunfight?

24:18.587 --> 24:20.284
Deal. Next time.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.286
You said "target."

24:22.330 --> 24:24.767
Are you thinking the bomb was
meant for Bree and not Alexa?

24:24.811 --> 24:26.726
Well, maybe the Bolivians knew

24:26.769 --> 24:28.162
that Bree always opened
her boss' mail,

24:28.205 --> 24:29.598
used it as a misdirect.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.165
Well, I still
don't understand.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.994
Why does the Bolivian cartel
want a Hollywood assistant dead?

24:34.037 --> 24:35.909
Did she neglect
to pick the pistachios

24:35.952 --> 24:37.040

24:37.084 --> 24:38.259
Well, that's the missing piece.

what Alexa knows.

24:43.046 --> 24:44.874

I need to find her
before the cartel does.

24:50.663 --> 24:53.013
Mm-hmm.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.673
So the bomb
wasn't for me.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.239
Well, the intended target

25:02.283 --> 25:04.546
was your assistant, Bree.
Have you heard from her lately?

What are you talking about?
Bree's in the hospital.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.028

possible?

25:13.642 --> 25:16.166
I-I was told she suffered
fatal internal injuries.

she's like a new man.

to make sure she's safe.

25:25.436 --> 25:27.569
What?
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.745
That, too,
but I need her back so bad.

to have someone take away

25:32.139 --> 25:33.444
an assistant you depend on?

25:33.488 --> 25:35.316
Yes, I do, actually.[sighs]

25:35.359 --> 25:38.058
I mean, I-I am seriously
lost here without her.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.103
I-I don't even know how
to call out of the office.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.278
Do you know how?

25:41.322 --> 25:43.193
So you have no idea
what kind of beef

25:43.237 --> 25:46.066
these Bolivian associates
of yours may have had with Bree?

25:46.109 --> 25:47.458
I don't.

25:47.502 --> 25:48.764
Bree is fluent in Spanish,

25:48.808 --> 25:50.592
so she dealt with those
investors directly.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.594
And you didn't think
to vet them at all

25:52.638 --> 25:54.204
before you went
into business with them?

25:54.248 --> 25:56.816
Have you seen the films I make?
I can't afford to be picky.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.774
Someone offers me money,
I take it.

25:58.818 --> 26:01.211
Okay, well, I'm gonna need to
see any documented interactions

26:01.255 --> 26:02.299
you have with these investors.

26:02.343 --> 26:04.737
Absolutely, they're in there.Okay.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.178
Oh, right.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.269
Only Bree's fingerprint
can unlock it.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.967
Bree installed a biometric lock
on the file cabinet?

26:18.011 --> 26:19.360
Seems a little paranoid.

26:19.403 --> 26:21.231
What did she
have to hide?

26:23.059 --> 26:25.627
Two recent incoming wires
for 50 grand each,

26:25.671 --> 26:27.281
both from a South
American bank.
Bingo.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.370
Shady side business
with the Bolivians it is.

26:29.413 --> 26:32.416
So Bree was embezzling
from that useless boss of hers.

26:32.460 --> 26:33.722
Huh, who can blame her?

26:33.766 --> 26:36.072
Does loyalty mean
nothing to you?

26:36.116 --> 26:38.640
Alexa gave Bree
her first job in Hollywood.

26:38.684 --> 26:39.815
She trained her.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.904
You don't just
ditch that

26:41.948 --> 26:44.864
the minute some
big-armed, blue-eyed,

26:44.907 --> 26:45.952

26:45.995 --> 26:48.824

comes around, okay?

26:48.868 --> 26:49.956
Y-you, you don't, you don't.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.132
Dan, if Bree bolted from the ER,

26:52.175 --> 26:54.090
maybe she left some things
behind, like her phone.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.527
Mm-hmm, which could hold proof

26:56.571 --> 26:58.312
to her connection
with the Bolivians.

26:58.355 --> 26:59.966
That's good thinking.
I'm gonna check on that.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.010
Okay, thanks.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.272
All right,
I'm gonna see if Pierce

27:02.316 --> 27:03.404
had any luck finding Bree.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.145
Oh, well,
he won't need any luck.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.973
He's got something
far better than that.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.540
Decker's right. You're cute.

27:09.584 --> 27:12.805
But I'm mid-bounty
and I just got a lead.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.371
So, if you don't mind...

27:14.415 --> 27:16.504
Lucifer told me to tell you
this is exactly the opposite

27:16.547 --> 27:18.419
of what Amenadiel wants.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.290
I'm in.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.292
Great.

27:22.336 --> 27:23.946
How do we find him?Well...

27:23.990 --> 27:27.428
Your brother's
a predictable one.

27:27.471 --> 27:30.518
He always runs to food or boobs.

27:30.561 --> 27:31.824
Usually boobs.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.521
That's how we found him
the first time.

27:33.564 --> 27:36.132
Now he hasboobs, that might
change his itinerary.

27:36.176 --> 27:38.265
That's right,
I totally forgot about that.

27:38.308 --> 27:40.876
[chuckles] Is he hot?

27:40.920 --> 27:43.400
Just tell me how we find him.

27:43.444 --> 27:44.837
Well, every now and again,

27:44.880 --> 27:47.578
the sucker would do something
I never saw coming.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.058
[elevator bell dings]

27:49.102 --> 27:50.277
Hello, Kane.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.974
And good-bye.[gunshot]

27:52.018 --> 27:53.410
[groans]

27:56.936 --> 27:58.285
Just like that.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.421
Yes! [grunts] Finally!

28:04.465 --> 28:05.596
Slayed you before

28:05.640 --> 28:07.511
you slayed me! [grunts]

28:07.555 --> 28:08.774
Ashes to ashes,

28:08.817 --> 28:10.689
you bastard!

28:10.732 --> 28:12.516
[grunts rhythmically]

28:12.560 --> 28:15.041
Enjoy it while
it lasts, Abel.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.478
How do you know my name?

28:17.521 --> 28:19.001
And what is that
supposed to mean?

28:20.481 --> 28:21.656
[grunting]

28:29.620 --> 28:31.144
Thanks for the heads-up.

28:31.187 --> 28:34.016
You said you wanted to die.
Make up your mind, cupcake.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.888
And the mark is still there.

28:35.931 --> 28:38.542
[sobbing] Please, no.
No, please.

28:38.586 --> 28:39.892
Please.

28:39.935 --> 28:42.633
Just make it quick, Kane.
Please make it quick.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.637
No.

28:46.681 --> 28:49.510
I need you alive,
so you can help me die.

28:49.553 --> 28:52.469
Wait, what?

28:52.513 --> 28:54.602
This has to be a trick.
You always kill me.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.473
That was when you were in Hell,

28:56.517 --> 28:58.649
where you've spent
the last few millennia.

28:58.693 --> 29:01.000
Maze tortured you
in the afterlife.

29:01.043 --> 29:04.003
Your punishment
was to get killed

29:04.046 --> 29:06.832
by me, over and over.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.572
MAZE:
That's right.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.792
You were trapped in a Hell loop,
but now you're out.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.101
You're alive, brother.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.713
[imitates explosion]

29:22.151 --> 29:23.762
Turns out Abel killing me
didn't remove the mark.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.720
Mm-hmm. Right, yes,
I got that from the whole

29:25.764 --> 29:27.113
"you still being alive"
of it all.

29:27.156 --> 29:30.029
So much for making
everything even-steven.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.552
It's now time for Plan "C."

29:31.595 --> 29:33.510
[scoffs]
I didn't realize we had one.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.077
We don't.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.949
But we'll think of something.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.777
Okay, and how is bringing
your she-brother

29:38.820 --> 29:40.474
into the precinct
going to help?

29:40.517 --> 29:43.564
Much as I'm enjoying his
Basic Instinctroutine.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.000
First things first,
we have to make sure

29:45.044 --> 29:46.132
the Bolivians
don't kill him.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.091
Bree.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.659
I'm Detective Decker.

29:51.702 --> 29:54.531
This is Charlotte Richards
from the DA's office.

29:54.575 --> 29:55.881
Miss Garland,
do you confirm

29:55.924 --> 29:58.057
that you're waiving
your right to legal council?

29:58.100 --> 30:02.148
Yes. Woman, I will waive
whatever you want me to waive.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.848
Uh, Lieutenant said
he had noticed

30:06.892 --> 30:08.632
some PTSD symptoms,

30:08.676 --> 30:09.720
so we should just
kind of roll with it

30:09.764 --> 30:11.853
if we can.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.769
Don't take this lightly,
Miss Garland.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.075
It's a big decision.

30:16.118 --> 30:19.121
Mmm. Not as big as my flock.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.689
Do you know how many
sheep I possess?

30:21.732 --> 30:24.518
Enough for two wives.

30:24.561 --> 30:27.173
Enough to feed
our offspring

30:27.216 --> 30:29.697
and our offspring's offspring.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.003
LUCIFER:
He fits right in.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.092
Is it me, or is your plan
going down in flames?

30:33.135 --> 30:34.528
It'll work.

30:34.571 --> 30:37.531
Well, as impressive
as your flock sounds,

30:37.574 --> 30:38.924
let's get back
to the deal.

30:38.967 --> 30:41.622
The terms are simple.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.015
You share all the
information you have

30:43.058 --> 30:45.147
on the Bolivian cartel
in exchange for immunity.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.106
And the full protection
of the LAPD.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.760
Yes, to whatever
those words mean.

30:49.804 --> 30:53.721
Now, let's discuss who is going
to lay with me first.

30:53.764 --> 30:57.768
Uh, don't you want to read
the terms of the deal, at least?

30:57.812 --> 31:00.989
What for? I've been told
you're very wise.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.730
I trust you.

31:02.773 --> 31:03.905
CHARLOTTE:
Just like that?

31:03.949 --> 31:05.646
You're going to
let us drive this,

31:05.689 --> 31:07.778
just completely give up control?

31:07.822 --> 31:08.779
Mm-hmm.

31:08.823 --> 31:10.694
Doesn't that scare you?

31:10.738 --> 31:14.698
Not nearly as much as the place
I just escaped.

31:14.742 --> 31:17.876
I would do anything to avoid
returning to that Hell.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.878
If you'd been there,
you would do the same.

31:25.013 --> 31:25.971
Charlotte.

31:26.014 --> 31:28.625
Yes, sorry,
we're good.

31:28.669 --> 31:31.759
Great. Great.
Okay, Bree?

31:31.802 --> 31:33.152
Mm-hmm.
Come on, you're
coming with me.

31:33.195 --> 31:36.720
[sharp inhale]
Mm, you smell good.

31:39.114 --> 31:42.074
Well so much for her being
released into yourcustody.

31:42.117 --> 31:44.032
We can't let him spend
too much time with Decker.

31:44.076 --> 31:45.555
She'll figure out
something's going on.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.644
[sighs] Let me see
what I can do.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.569
It's time for you
to go home, Abel.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.745
It wasn't easy for me
to track you down,

32:01.789 --> 32:03.922
but you're not getting away
from me this time.

32:06.098 --> 32:08.143
What the...

32:08.187 --> 32:11.668
MAZE: Meet my
punching bag.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.714
Look familiar?

32:13.757 --> 32:17.892
Mazikeen.
What are you doing here?

32:17.936 --> 32:20.025
What does it look like?

32:20.068 --> 32:22.288
Keeping you out
of Lucifer's way.

32:25.856 --> 32:26.901
[shouts]

32:26.945 --> 32:28.033
I don't want to
fight you, Mazikeen.

32:28.076 --> 32:30.992
Who cares what you want?

32:34.822 --> 32:36.824
So you worked here
for two years,

32:36.867 --> 32:37.912
it's still not ringing a bell?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.914
No, but your backside
is ringing a...

32:39.958 --> 32:41.263
Oh, you poor, forgetful thing.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.917
Thankfully, all we need
is your fingerprint.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.137
Well, my finger goes wherever
the lady tells me it goes.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.182
[phone ringing, vibrating]

32:47.226 --> 32:49.663
Hey, Dan. Did you have any
luck finding Bree's phone?

32:49.706 --> 32:51.230
DAN:
No.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.666
Because guess who collected
her stuff from the hospital?

32:52.709 --> 32:54.798
Alexa.

32:54.842 --> 32:55.799
That's odd.

32:55.843 --> 32:56.626
Yeah, right?

32:56.670 --> 32:58.019
So, I dug deeper.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.803
Looked into her Pilates alibi.

32:59.847 --> 33:01.762
Get this: her class

33:01.805 --> 33:03.068
is actually in the morning.

33:03.111 --> 33:05.809
She rescheduled that day
for 2:00 p.m. exactly.

33:05.853 --> 33:07.898
It's like she knew to be
out of the office.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.161
She knew the bomb was coming.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.032
Who knew?
Alexa.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.816
What, and the Bolivians
warned her? Why?

33:12.860 --> 33:14.688
Put it on speakerphone.[sighs]

33:14.731 --> 33:17.865
Okay, maybe the Bolivians were
working with Alexa, not Bree.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.867
Maybe Bree found out
what they were up to

33:19.910 --> 33:20.955
and wanted to blow the whistle.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.696
Well, that would explain

33:22.739 --> 33:24.915
those incoming wires
in Bree's account.

33:24.959 --> 33:27.788
Cartel tried to pay her off,
silence her.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.268
And when the nice way
didn't work,

33:29.311 --> 33:30.878
they tried the not-so-nice way.

33:30.921 --> 33:33.968
Well, hopefully the proof is
behind drawer number one, so...

33:34.012 --> 33:35.274
Wait a minute.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.840
Why would Alexa send us
straight to the place

33:36.884 --> 33:38.712
where we'd find proof
of her crimes?

33:38.755 --> 33:39.800
Makes no sense.

33:39.843 --> 33:41.236
Unless...

33:42.107 --> 33:43.891
...it's a trap.

33:44.935 --> 33:45.980
Bree, wait!

33:46.024 --> 33:47.677
[clicks, beeps]

33:50.158 --> 33:52.856
Don't move.

34:02.388 --> 34:03.824
DAN:
Alexa knew Bree would need proof

34:03.867 --> 34:05.956
to turn her in, so she must have
rigged the file cabinet

34:06.000 --> 34:07.741
that contained it.
We walked right into her trap.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.134
If they move,
the whole thing blows.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.700
Call the bomb squad.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.789
PIERCE: Decker, you need to get
out of there, stat.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.182
I'm not going anywhere,
Lieutenant.

34:14.226 --> 34:15.923
What do you mean,
you're not going anywhere?

34:15.966 --> 34:18.012
You need to get
out of there, now.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.927
Don't worry,
I'm staying right here.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.842
Oh, woman,
your loyalty touches me.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.148
PIERCE: What happened to
"You're the lieutenant,

34:23.191 --> 34:24.236
you call the shots"?

34:24.279 --> 34:25.933
CHLOE:
There is an innocent victim

34:25.976 --> 34:27.935
glued to a bomb.

34:27.978 --> 34:30.764
"Innocent victim"
is highly debatable.

34:30.807 --> 34:32.200
Lucifer, Bree was trying to do
the right thing.

34:32.244 --> 34:34.985
It's why the Bolivians
and Alexa want her dead.

34:35.029 --> 34:35.943
I'm not leaving.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.075
ABEL:
Oh, my flock

34:37.118 --> 34:38.859
is your flock,
this I swear.

34:38.902 --> 34:39.990
PIERCE:
Okay.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.775
No, no, no, o-opposite of okay.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.951
PIERCE:
If you're gonna stay, Decker,

34:43.994 --> 34:45.126
I can talk you through
defusing it.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.736
It's safer
than waiting for it

34:46.780 --> 34:48.042
to blow up before the bomb squad
gets there...

34:48.086 --> 34:49.217
Wait a minute.
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.219
Chloe, Chloe,
think about this, okay?

34:51.263 --> 34:52.916
Think about Trixie.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.005
I amthinking about her.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.747
And I'm also thinking
that Bree's a daughter, too.

34:57.791 --> 34:58.966
Oh, come on.

35:00.054 --> 35:02.100
So...
[sighs]

35:02.143 --> 35:04.363
...what do I do now? What,

35:04.406 --> 35:06.191
cut all these wires willy-nilly?

35:07.279 --> 35:09.019
Damn movies. No.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.196
You have to get into the box
and disconnect the trigger.

35:11.239 --> 35:12.458
And, very carefully,

35:12.501 --> 35:14.024
remove the blasting cap.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.417
Ugh, this is madness.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.115
PIERCE:
Then toss it as far as possible.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.943
Oh, you want her to toss an
explosive, that sounds safe.

35:19.987 --> 35:22.816
If the cap goes off away from
the charge, it'll be harmless.

35:22.859 --> 35:25.297
Lieutenant!
I understand why your priority

35:25.340 --> 35:27.299
is to save your...

35:27.342 --> 35:29.388
this young woman, but I
will not let you endanger

35:29.431 --> 35:31.041
the detective's life
in the process.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.782
He's not endangering my life.

35:32.826 --> 35:35.220
I am choosing to be here,
and if you're not gonna help,

35:35.263 --> 35:36.960
you should probably just leave.

35:37.004 --> 35:38.832
Well, we both know
I'm not gonna do that.

35:40.050 --> 35:42.052
I'm your partner.

35:44.403 --> 35:46.883
Okay, good.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.233
Then listen to me--
I'm gonna need both my hands,

35:48.276 --> 35:49.408
so please come help me.

35:49.451 --> 35:51.410
Okay? Hold this.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.849
I'll use this,
and, uh...

35:55.892 --> 35:57.067
All right.

35:58.895 --> 36:00.897
[bomb beeping]

36:00.941 --> 36:02.986
[quietly]:
Easy...

36:05.032 --> 36:07.165
CHLOE:
Got the blasting cap.

36:08.470 --> 36:09.906
And...

36:13.954 --> 36:16.043
Okay.

36:16.086 --> 36:20.003
I think that means you can
take your thumb off now.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.353
[beeps]

36:21.396 --> 36:22.484
All right.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.051
And don't tell us

36:24.094 --> 36:25.531
where you want to put it next.

36:25.574 --> 36:27.054
MAZE:
Up your butt!

36:27.097 --> 36:29.230
[panting]

36:29.274 --> 36:30.971
That's where I want
to shove this.

36:31.014 --> 36:34.409
And then, I'll press the button.

36:34.453 --> 36:36.542
I don't even understand
why you're so angry.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.414
So what if Linda and I
got together?

36:41.024 --> 36:43.940
You dumped me.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.855
Remember?

36:45.899 --> 36:48.249
No, it's not about that.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.947
Okay? It's about the betrayal.

36:50.991 --> 36:51.992
The dirty...

36:52.993 --> 36:54.081
...sneaky...

36:55.952 --> 36:56.910
...lies!

36:56.953 --> 36:58.172
When will
you understand

36:58.216 --> 37:01.175
that we were trying
to protect you?

37:01.219 --> 37:03.960
And when will you understand
I don't believe you?

37:04.004 --> 37:07.050
[sighs]

37:07.094 --> 37:08.008
All right.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.490
Fine.

[both panting]

Well, come on!

37:22.065 --> 37:24.938
Come on! It's no fun
if you just stand there!

It's about as much fun
as watching you

Okay, thank you.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.316
Hi.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.535
So, we were able to lift

37:56.578 --> 37:58.624
one of Alexa's prints
from the explosive.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.103
Oh, good.

38:00.147 --> 38:01.540
Sounds like enough
to arrest her for murder.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.281
And get her to flip
on the Bolivians.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.065
Apparently, she was using
her movies to launder money

38:05.108 --> 38:06.371
for the cartel.

38:06.414 --> 38:08.329
And that's what Bree
was trying to expose.

38:08.373 --> 38:11.332
Shame. I mean, I had the perfect
title for The Plunge 2.

38:12.681 --> 38:13.987
2 Deep 2 Plunge.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.382
[both chuckle]Yeah, I get it.

38:17.425 --> 38:18.470
It's funny.

38:18.513 --> 38:20.080
Yeah.
Yeah.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.386
So...

38:21.429 --> 38:22.952
[clears throat]

38:22.996 --> 38:24.650
...I just wanted
to say thank you, again.

38:26.565 --> 38:28.393
I couldn't have done it
without you.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.135
Night.

38:35.051 --> 38:37.576
Without me...

38:37.619 --> 38:42.320
you wouldn't have been in danger
in the first place.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.541
CHARLOTTE:
I'm sorry about last time.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.674
I'm a bit of a control freak.

38:48.717 --> 38:50.023
Ah.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.067
Really?

38:51.111 --> 38:52.112
I hadn't noticed.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.157
[chuckles softly]

38:54.201 --> 38:55.158
So, what's changed?

38:55.202 --> 38:57.117
Well, I realized

38:57.160 --> 38:59.249
that you're right,
you're the expert.

38:59.293 --> 39:02.209
And I should
trust you.

39:02.252 --> 39:05.604
And as scary as that is...
[sighs]

39:05.647 --> 39:07.301
...there's something
much scarier.

39:09.477 --> 39:12.480
I, um, I wake up...

39:14.569 --> 39:16.136
...smell coffee.

39:16.179 --> 39:17.093
It's nice.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.268
I have breakfast

39:18.312 --> 39:19.574
with my family.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.446
Uh, we're happy.

39:21.489 --> 39:24.144
[chuckles]

39:24.187 --> 39:25.232
At peace.

39:25.275 --> 39:27.103
And then, a man

39:27.147 --> 39:30.063
walks in
and shoots each of them.

39:30.106 --> 39:31.630
Dead.

39:31.673 --> 39:35.024
And I know this man because he's
somebody that I represented,

39:35.068 --> 39:38.506
and I know that he should be
in jail, but he's not.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.118
Because of me.

39:45.252 --> 39:47.123
I just smile,

39:47.167 --> 39:50.257
while my family is killed.

Because I'm the reason
that it's happening.

40:00.136 --> 40:02.574
I'm the reason that he's free.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.710
And then, I wake up.

40:08.754 --> 40:12.192
It's a new morning.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.412
I smell the same coffee.

40:16.457 --> 40:19.460
Pour the same cereal.

40:19.504 --> 40:23.377
And then, someone else walks in,

40:23.421 --> 40:25.466
and shoots my family.

40:27.512 --> 40:30.471
This time,
it's a different person.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.474
Someone else I set free.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.483
And I just...

40:42.527 --> 40:46.095
smile again.

40:46.139 --> 40:49.142
And I die inside again.

40:49.185 --> 40:52.232
Over and over, and...

40:55.540 --> 41:00.196
I don't know what it'll take
to stay out of that place.

41:03.243 --> 41:06.376
I'm trying my best.

41:06.420 --> 41:09.423
But I don't know
if it'll be enough.
