00:01.406 --> 00:04.106
- Do you guys have
everything you need for school?

00:05.148 --> 00:06.715
By "you guys,"
I mean Jenny.

00:08.148 --> 00:10.415
I need to run back to
my bedroom for a second.

00:11.981 --> 00:13.648
- That girl would
forget her head,

00:13.748 --> 00:14.981
if it wasn't screwed on.

00:15.081 --> 00:17.081
- Who wouldn't?

00:17.181 --> 00:19.481
Mom, Dad, I need to begin
my walk to school now

00:19.581 --> 00:20.548
to be on time.

00:20.648 --> 00:22.115
- Okay, Frankie.
Now remember, you...

00:22.215 --> 00:24.215
- I can't let anyone
know that I am an android,

00:24.315 --> 00:26.281
or we will all be
in grave danger.

00:26.381 --> 00:28.615
I will not forget.
It is safe in my files.

00:28.715 --> 00:30.648
- Of course, it is.
Have a good day.

00:32.981 --> 00:34.381
- Goodbye, Mom.

00:37.281 --> 00:39.615
- Did you see that?
She hugged me.

00:41.381 --> 00:42.748
- Don't you mean
you hugged her?

00:42.848 --> 00:45.748
- No, Will,
she initiated it.

00:45.848 --> 00:49.148
This could be huge...
A sign of human attachment.

00:49.248 --> 00:51.515
It could mean that she's
developing like a human.

00:51.615 --> 00:54.881
- She was probably just
imitating Jenny.

00:54.981 --> 00:56.315
- Our daughter?

00:56.381 --> 00:58.881
When was the last time
that Jenny hugged you?

00:58.981 --> 01:00.715
- She hugs me
all the time.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.481 --> 01:12.515
Don't look at me
like that.

01:12.615 --> 01:13.915
When you're right,
you're right.

01:14.015 --> 01:15.581
- I need to go call James.

01:15.681 --> 01:17.648
- Wait.

01:22.481 --> 01:24.448
Sigourney?

01:24.548 --> 01:26.048
- I think you're gonna
wanna hear this.

01:26.148 --> 01:28.315
It's about Frankie
and it's huge.

01:28.415 --> 01:30.048
- Oh. Please, go ahead.

01:30.148 --> 01:31.448
- Frankie hugged me.

01:31.548 --> 01:33.381
- Imitative behavior.
Mirroring.

01:33.481 --> 01:35.015
We've seen that.
- No, that's just it.

01:35.115 --> 01:37.515
She wasn't
imitating anyone.

01:37.615 --> 01:39.315
She did it
independently.

01:39.348 --> 01:40.981
- Wait. Are you sure?

01:41.081 --> 01:42.548
If that's true,
we're talking about

01:42.648 --> 01:45.148
an unprecedented
AI breakthrough.

01:45.315 --> 01:47.515
- Yes! I knew
you'd understand.

01:47.615 --> 01:49.548
I'm about to note
it in my data.

01:49.648 --> 01:50.848
- I've gotta run.

01:52.448 --> 01:55.115
Do you know what
this means, my boy?

01:55.215 --> 01:57.981
If what she said
is true,

01:58.081 --> 02:01.881
you're going to be more human
than I ever dreamed of.

02:03.415 --> 02:06.881
Tammy, that
is a beautiful thing.

02:06.981 --> 02:10.315
- And, much like me,
it doesn't just look good...

02:12.181 --> 02:14.548
- ...it's awesome at
detecting a cheat.

02:14.648 --> 02:16.381
- Do you really think
Frankie's going around

02:16.481 --> 02:18.315
wearing an earpiece?
- Of course.

02:18.348 --> 02:20.381
What other explanation
could there be?

02:20.481 --> 02:23.048
Look, I don't know if
it's connected to a radio,

02:23.148 --> 02:25.315
or a computer,
but whatever it is,

02:25.381 --> 02:27.581
I'm gonna find it
and take her down.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.348
- Did you ever think maybe
she's just really, really smart?

02:30.448 --> 02:34.181
- So, uh, when are you
gonna bust the cheater?

02:34.315 --> 02:37.015
- When we can achieve
maximum humiliation.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.515
- Right. Timing
is everything.

02:39.615 --> 02:41.048
- So, we're in agreement.

02:41.148 --> 02:43.581
We will expose Frankie
in the one place

02:43.681 --> 02:46.315
where everyone will
see she's a fraud.

02:46.415 --> 02:48.081
- The cafeteria.
- Math class.

02:48.181 --> 02:49.581
- Math class.

02:52.115 --> 02:54.648
- I've got it.
It's confirmed.

02:54.748 --> 02:56.115
- Got what?
What have we got?

02:56.215 --> 02:58.381
- Uh, the numbers
that we found, sir.

02:58.481 --> 03:00.081
They're geographic
coordinates.

03:01.881 --> 03:03.315
Uh, no hand.

03:03.381 --> 03:05.315
- Well, give me
the precise location.

03:05.348 --> 03:07.648
I'll dispatch an extraction
team immediately.

03:07.748 --> 03:10.381
- I'm afraid we can't
do that, sir.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.381
The paper that
was found was ripped.

03:12.481 --> 03:13.681
It only had one number.

03:13.781 --> 03:15.381
If we only
have one number,

03:15.481 --> 03:17.715
it means we only have
half of the location.

03:17.815 --> 03:20.448
If we consider the Earth
as an ellipsoid or sphere,

03:20.548 --> 03:22.648
latitude lines run
parallel to the equator,

03:22.748 --> 03:24.681
and longitude lines
run north and south,

03:24.781 --> 03:25.815
or pole-to-pole.

03:25.915 --> 03:28.048
- I know how latitude
and longitude work,

03:28.148 --> 03:29.681
you flying disco ball.

03:29.781 --> 03:32.915
Just tell me how we are going
to find Gaines and the android.

03:33.015 --> 03:34.048
We can't, sir.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.515
Without the other number,

03:35.615 --> 03:37.481
we don't have a prayer
of finding them.

03:37.581 --> 03:40.315
- I... I think
I know a way.

03:40.348 --> 03:42.015
- You know how
to find the android?

03:42.115 --> 03:43.915
Of course, she does.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.315
What are you waiting for?

03:45.415 --> 03:48.615
Tell Mr. Kingston
the plan "we" discussed.

03:48.715 --> 03:51.315
- Uh, "we" can create
an algorithm

03:51.348 --> 03:52.948
that will mine all
of the past information

03:53.048 --> 03:54.581
we have on
the Gaines family,

03:54.681 --> 03:57.315
and then we cross-reference
that with geographical factors,

03:57.348 --> 03:59.615
and then, based on
the known coordinates...

03:59.715 --> 04:03.115
- ...we can find
my android.

04:25.547 --> 04:28.647
Byron, he's so cute.

04:28.747 --> 04:30.581
I didn't know
you liked robots.

04:30.681 --> 04:33.081
- I don't like them.
I love them.

04:35.581 --> 04:37.447
- The robot is fond of
you, too, Byron Patrick.

04:39.514 --> 04:42.181
- She's always gotta
be the center of attention.

04:42.281 --> 04:43.581
It's so pathetic.

04:43.681 --> 04:46.547
- Yeah, that's your
thing, Tammy.

04:46.647 --> 04:49.647
- And it's gonna be
my thing again really soon.

04:52.681 --> 04:54.381
I call him "Bob."

04:55.781 --> 04:57.547
- She says she wishes
she had a girl name.

04:59.014 --> 05:01.214
- Okay, everyone,
take your seats.

05:03.614 --> 05:05.914
Um, you know,
Mr. Manhart,

05:06.014 --> 05:08.514
it's a shame they're
being so disrespectful.

05:08.614 --> 05:10.381
Didn't you tell us that
having toys in class

05:10.481 --> 05:11.781
is against the rules?

05:11.881 --> 05:15.647
- Ah, if only every
student were like you, Tammy.

05:15.747 --> 05:17.647
Seats, people.

05:17.747 --> 05:20.681
Whose toy is this?

05:20.781 --> 05:22.314
- She says she's
not a toy.

05:22.414 --> 05:23.747
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

05:23.847 --> 05:25.347
Frankie, is it yours?

05:25.447 --> 05:27.681
- It's mine, sir,
and it's not a toy.

05:27.781 --> 05:29.414
It's for robotics class.

05:29.514 --> 05:30.681
- Be that as it may,

05:30.781 --> 05:32.747
a toy is an object
a child plays with

05:32.847 --> 05:35.481
and something you're
clearly doing now.

05:35.581 --> 05:37.347
I'll take that.

05:41.181 --> 05:45.014
Today, we will be solving
quadratic equations

05:45.181 --> 05:48.481
with integral coefficients,
and integral roots.

05:48.581 --> 05:51.447
- Poor Byron.
He looks so upset.

05:51.547 --> 05:52.847
- How can you tell?

05:52.947 --> 05:54.514
Well,
he's frowning,

05:54.614 --> 05:56.481
his shoulders
are kind of slumped over.

05:56.581 --> 05:58.747
Yeah, I know.
It makes me sad, too.

05:58.847 --> 06:01.547
He worked so hard
on that cute robot.

06:01.647 --> 06:03.547
Hey, can you control it?

06:03.647 --> 06:04.881
- Of course, I can.

06:04.981 --> 06:06.647
- Make it come
back to him,

06:06.747 --> 06:08.481
but don't let
Mr. Manhart see.

06:17.547 --> 06:19.014
- What was that?

06:19.181 --> 06:20.647
- Beep!
- Beep!

06:20.747 --> 06:22.647
- Very funny, Miss Gaines.

06:22.747 --> 06:24.814
I guess you feel like
you can play games

06:24.914 --> 06:26.781
because you already know
how to solve this equation.

06:26.881 --> 06:29.181
Perhaps you'd like to come
up here and show us.

06:29.247 --> 06:31.847
There are several
ways to find the solution.

06:33.281 --> 06:34.814
I will demonstrate
all three.

06:41.647 --> 06:43.414
- How does she know
how to do this?

06:43.514 --> 06:44.881
We haven't even
learned it yet.

06:44.981 --> 06:47.381
- I told you.
She's cheating.

06:47.481 --> 06:50.014
And now everyone
will know.

06:51.447 --> 06:53.281
- X equals -1.
- Correct!

06:54.747 --> 06:56.347
Excellent work, Miss Gaines.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.414
- Tammy, didn't we just
discuss the rules

07:05.514 --> 07:07.214
about having toys
in my class?

07:07.314 --> 07:08.414
- I'm sorry,
Mr. Manhart.

07:08.514 --> 07:09.714
- You're sorry,
Mr. Manhart?

07:09.814 --> 07:11.847
You just destroyed
my robotics assignment.

07:11.947 --> 07:13.547
- Yeah, that
I confiscated

07:13.647 --> 07:15.747
and you tried to steal back.
- I didn't.

07:15.847 --> 07:17.381
- Aren't you curious
how she knew

07:17.481 --> 07:19.214
the answer to
that equation?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.547
- Would you like me to
explain it to you, Tammy Gil...

07:21.647 --> 07:22.914
- No, that's not
what I meant.

07:23.014 --> 07:25.714
Everybody,
just return to your seats,

07:25.814 --> 07:28.081
and I'll deal with
you two later.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.581
- Poor Byron.

07:29.681 --> 07:31.214
He had to watch
Bob get crushed

07:31.314 --> 07:34.381
and Mr. Manhart made
him stay after class.

07:37.781 --> 07:39.214
- This is all my fault.

07:39.314 --> 07:41.581
If I hadn't asked you to bring
the robot back to him,

07:41.681 --> 07:43.181
Tammy never would
have tripped on it,

07:43.214 --> 07:44.881
and Byron would have never
gotten in trouble.

07:44.981 --> 07:46.881
- You are correct,
Dayton Reyes.

07:46.981 --> 07:48.714
- Thanks for making
me feel better.

07:48.814 --> 07:49.781
- You're welcome.

07:49.881 --> 07:51.981
- No, I was...
Never mind.

07:52.081 --> 07:53.747
Why did Tammy trip
on the robot?

07:53.847 --> 07:55.014
- That's obvious.

07:55.181 --> 07:56.714
It got in the path
of her feet

07:56.814 --> 07:58.647
while she was walking to
the front of the class.

07:58.747 --> 07:59.981
- Exactly.

08:00.081 --> 08:01.981
But why was she walking
to the front of the class?

08:02.081 --> 08:04.314
Manhart hadn't
called on her.

08:04.414 --> 08:07.214
And what was
she carrying?

08:07.314 --> 08:09.847
Tammy would never bring
a toy to math class.

08:11.281 --> 08:13.181
Something's fishy.

08:15.081 --> 08:18.547
My olfactory senses indicate
it is your tuna fish sandwich.

08:20.447 --> 08:23.181
Hey, there's Cole.

08:25.281 --> 08:27.014
Cole!

08:30.414 --> 08:32.081
- Hi, Frankie, Dayton.

08:32.181 --> 08:33.514
- What are you doing
sitting by yourself?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.714
- I'm supposed to be meeting
Tammy for a tutoring session,

08:35.813 --> 08:37.581
but she never showed.

08:37.681 --> 08:39.181
- That is
Dayton Reyes' fault.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.280
- Frankie!

08:40.381 --> 08:43.514
She might have had to
stay after math class.

08:43.614 --> 08:45.714
It's complicated.
- Great.

08:45.814 --> 08:47.247
Then I need to go study.

08:47.347 --> 08:49.814
If I fail this test,
then I'm off the tennis team.

08:49.914 --> 08:52.014
- Really?
That stinks.

08:52.181 --> 08:55.081
- No, that is still
your sandwich.

08:56.014 --> 08:58.181
Yeah, I think she's right.

08:58.281 --> 09:00.514
See you later, Frankie.

09:04.447 --> 09:05.814
- Ladies...

09:05.914 --> 09:08.481
- We brought you lunch.

09:08.581 --> 09:09.847
- I don't have time to eat.

09:09.947 --> 09:12.314
I have to rebuild
my RF scanner.

09:12.414 --> 09:15.047
Luckily, I think the casing
took the worst of it.

09:15.181 --> 09:17.614
I can get it working by
the end of this period.

09:17.714 --> 09:20.381
- And then it's gonna be,
"bye, Felicia!"

09:21.481 --> 09:22.714
- Who's Felicia?

09:22.814 --> 09:24.781
I thought we were
busting Frankie.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.947
- Why aren't you
eating your lunch?

09:27.047 --> 09:28.914
Mom says humans need to
recharge the batteries, too,

09:29.014 --> 09:30.614
or they will be
cranky like Jenny.

09:30.714 --> 09:33.781
- I can't stop thinking
about Byron.

09:33.881 --> 09:35.547
- You can't think and eat?

09:35.647 --> 09:37.181
I have parallel
processing capabilities.

09:37.214 --> 09:39.981
I can perform physical tasks
and think, simultaneously.

09:40.081 --> 09:42.447
- No, Frankie, I'm not
in the mood to eat

09:42.547 --> 09:46.414
because I feel guilty about
getting Byron's robot crushed.

09:46.514 --> 09:49.781
The right thing to do
is to tell him I'm sorry.

09:52.714 --> 09:54.381
Whoa, Frankie, where
are we going?

09:54.481 --> 09:55.847
- To do the right thing.

09:55.947 --> 09:57.914
I am helping you take
responsibility for your actions.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.247
- No, no, no, Frankie, wait!
That is a terrible idea.

10:00.347 --> 10:01.281
Then he'll be mad at me,

10:01.381 --> 10:03.381
and he'll wanna know why
it was my fault.

10:03.481 --> 10:05.014
Just forget it.

10:05.114 --> 10:07.081
You just forgot it,
didn't you?

10:07.181 --> 10:08.114
- Forgot what?

10:08.214 --> 10:09.347
- Never mind.

10:09.447 --> 10:10.647
Oh, I know.

10:10.747 --> 10:13.347
I can do something nice
for Byron, instead.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.481
Something that'll make
us both feel better.

10:19.614 --> 10:21.081
- We can make him
a sweet dessert.

10:21.181 --> 10:23.814
Remember all the pastry blogs
we found in his browser history?

10:23.914 --> 10:25.381
There was an emphasis
on brownies.

10:25.481 --> 10:26.481
- Yes!

10:26.581 --> 10:28.114
There's just one problem.

10:28.214 --> 10:29.781
I don't know how
to make brownies.

10:29.881 --> 10:31.647
- Neither do I.

10:31.747 --> 10:34.247
But I do have access to several
million recipes on the internet,

10:34.347 --> 10:36.981
and thousands of hours
of video instructions.

10:37.081 --> 10:38.647
Of course, you do.

10:38.747 --> 10:40.314
That's great.

10:40.414 --> 10:42.047
- I know.

10:44.914 --> 10:47.014
This is gonna be awesome.

10:58.806 --> 11:00.072
- Frankie?

11:05.206 --> 11:06.639
- Nice hiding spot.

11:06.739 --> 11:08.772
Come on out.
The coast is clear.

11:08.872 --> 11:10.606
- Why do people always
say there is a coast,

11:10.639 --> 11:11.706
and that it is clear?

11:11.806 --> 11:13.339
- It's just a figure
of speech.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.706
- While I was hiding,
I took the liberty

11:14.806 --> 11:17.072
of searching the internet
for chocolate brownie recipes.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.272
Oh, perfect!

11:22.372 --> 11:23.806
Oh, I like that one.

11:23.906 --> 11:26.239
Chewy, fudgy
chocolate brookies.

11:26.339 --> 11:28.206
Are they brownies?
Are they cookies?

11:28.306 --> 11:30.306
That's what makes
them so much fun!

11:30.406 --> 11:34.639
Eggs, flour,
chocolate chips.

11:34.739 --> 11:39.406
Hm, we'll need a big bowl,
a container of sugar.

11:42.506 --> 11:44.606
- Okay. Now what?

12:29.706 --> 12:31.706
- Uh, Frankie, did you
know that recipe

12:31.806 --> 12:35.006
would make all
these brookies?

12:35.106 --> 12:36.072
- Of course.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.739
You wanted to make
Byron Patrick happy.

12:37.839 --> 12:39.472
If brookies make
Byron Patrick happy,

12:39.606 --> 12:40.806
then it is logical
that more brookies

12:40.906 --> 12:42.872
will make Byron Patrick
more happy.

12:45.672 --> 12:48.039
- Mmmm, they are
delicious.

12:49.439 --> 12:51.839
Hey, there's Byron.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.039
I'm gonna bring
him a brookie.

12:54.139 --> 12:55.839
- Bring him many brookies.

12:55.939 --> 12:57.506
- Great idea.

12:57.606 --> 12:59.872
Maybe try and give
the rest of those away?

13:04.206 --> 13:06.072
- Whoa, what are you doing
with all those cookies?

13:06.172 --> 13:07.206
- These are not cookies.

13:07.306 --> 13:08.606
They are chewy, fudgy,
chocolate brookies,

13:08.706 --> 13:10.239
and I am trying to
give them away.

13:10.339 --> 13:11.939
Dayton Reyes and I
made too many.

13:12.039 --> 13:13.139
Would you like one?

13:13.239 --> 13:14.339
- Would I ever.

13:14.439 --> 13:16.306
- I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

13:16.406 --> 13:17.806
Would you?

13:19.739 --> 13:22.239
- Byron!
- Hey, Dayton.

13:22.339 --> 13:24.439
- I brought
you something.

13:24.606 --> 13:27.406
- Are those
chocolate brookies?

13:27.506 --> 13:29.639
No way.

13:29.739 --> 13:31.706
Are they brownies?
Are they cookies?

13:31.806 --> 13:33.806
That's
what makes them so fun!

13:35.172 --> 13:37.906
- These are, like, my favorite
things in the world.

13:38.006 --> 13:39.439
How did you know?

13:39.606 --> 13:41.606
- Um, lucky guess.

13:41.672 --> 13:44.206
I mean, who doesn't like
chocolate brookies?

13:44.306 --> 13:45.372
- Lots of people.

13:45.472 --> 13:47.606
My dad, for instance,
hates them.

13:47.639 --> 13:50.839
He's a chocolate purist
and only eats beans or bars.

13:50.939 --> 13:52.772
Says adulterating chocolate
with anything

13:52.872 --> 13:55.839
is like putting parmesan
cheese on seafood pasta.

13:55.939 --> 13:58.806
- I kinda like parmesan
cheese on seafood pasta.

13:58.906 --> 14:01.672
- Me, too, but don't
tell my dad.

14:03.072 --> 14:05.739
- Thanks for these.
You really made my day.

14:09.839 --> 14:12.372
- Okay, uh,
see you tomorrow.

14:12.472 --> 14:14.606
Bye.

14:20.106 --> 14:21.406
Dayton Reyes
and I made them.

14:21.506 --> 14:22.839
She says they're delicious.

14:22.939 --> 14:26.406
- Sorry, we don't eat
anything made by cheaters.

14:26.506 --> 14:27.672
Right, Makay...

14:27.772 --> 14:30.739
- Wow, these are
delicious!

14:30.839 --> 14:33.072
- I'll be the judge
of that.

14:34.339 --> 14:35.839
- What are you
guys doing?

14:35.939 --> 14:37.206
Nothing!

14:37.306 --> 14:39.606
- They're eating chewy,
fudgy, chocolate brookies.

14:39.706 --> 14:41.906
- Thank you,
Captain Obvious.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.606
- I am not a captain.
That is obvious.

14:56.139 --> 14:58.206
- You may be able to
distract everyone else

14:58.306 --> 15:02.406
with an excessive amount of
your weird, hybrid desserts.

15:02.506 --> 15:04.039
But I know your
secret, Frankie,

15:04.139 --> 15:07.272
and I promise you, soon,
everyone else will, too.

15:12.439 --> 15:14.606
- She knows your secret?

15:14.706 --> 15:16.639
Didn't you say
if your secret gets out,

15:16.739 --> 15:18.039
you'll be in danger?

15:18.139 --> 15:20.739
- Yes, Dayton Reyes,
that's what Mom says.

15:20.839 --> 15:24.272
- Frankie, this is bad,
real bad.

15:28.606 --> 15:30.339
- Okay, don't panic,
Frankie.

15:30.439 --> 15:31.606
It's gonna be all right.

15:31.672 --> 15:32.939
- I am not panicking...

15:33.039 --> 15:34.639
Although it appears
you may be.

15:34.739 --> 15:36.406
- We can totally
fix this.

15:36.506 --> 15:38.339
How are we gonna
fix this?

15:38.439 --> 15:41.272
Okay, first, we need to find
out exactly what Tammy knows.

15:41.372 --> 15:43.106
- How will we find out?

15:43.206 --> 15:46.239
- The same way we found out
Byron likes brownies.

15:46.339 --> 15:47.672
Can you...

15:47.772 --> 15:49.139
- I have scanned all
of Tammy Gilroy's

15:49.239 --> 15:50.806
social media feeds
for the past year.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.106
- I'll never get
used to that.

15:52.206 --> 15:53.639
- Do you want
to review them?

15:53.739 --> 15:54.639
- Of course.

15:54.739 --> 15:57.072
But only because
I have to.

15:57.172 --> 15:59.639
Let's not do it here.
Come on.

16:10.439 --> 16:13.706
Virus eliminated!

16:19.072 --> 16:22.739
Okay, enough celebrating.
Back to work.

16:22.839 --> 16:24.972
Well, maybe there's
time for one more.

16:30.106 --> 16:31.472
Okay.

16:31.896 --> 16:33.429
Now that we're up
and running,

16:33.529 --> 16:36.529
let's check up on
our friends at EGG.

16:36.629 --> 16:40.229
Undoubtedly Kingston is trying
to get his android back.

16:44.662 --> 16:47.662
Geolocation coordinates.

16:47.762 --> 16:49.429
That's not good.

16:50.896 --> 16:54.162
It's only a matter of time
before they find her.

16:54.262 --> 16:55.896
If they take the android,

16:55.996 --> 16:59.462
they'll take
Sigourney's data, too.

16:59.562 --> 17:01.629
I'll be sunk.

17:05.561 --> 17:08.429
Look alive,
enginerds.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.429
What have you found
for Mr. Kingston?

17:10.529 --> 17:13.029
- Cross-referencing educational
history and climate data

17:13.128 --> 17:14.262
with one of the coordinates,

17:14.362 --> 17:17.429
we have found an extremely
promising location.

17:17.529 --> 17:19.561
The android
is on an island

17:19.662 --> 17:22.096
off the coast of North Africa
in the Atlantic Ocean.

17:22.195 --> 17:24.229
- Is there a live feed
we can access?

17:24.329 --> 17:25.529
- Let me pull it up.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.296
- I'll do it.
- Route the data to me.

17:29.662 --> 17:33.062
- Is this a joke, PEGSI?

17:33.162 --> 17:34.996
No, sir, that's
vacation footage.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.796
My apologies.

17:36.896 --> 17:39.262
Here's the feed
from the island.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.696
- My patience
is wearing thin.

17:41.796 --> 17:43.362
- Oh, I don't understand.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.296
The data showed that Sigourney
lived in a village

17:45.396 --> 17:46.962
with those coordinates
during college.

17:47.062 --> 17:48.429
- Well, maybe that was
before the village

17:48.529 --> 17:51.296
was destroyed
by molten lava!

17:51.396 --> 17:53.429
What kind of fool
do you take me for, hm?

17:53.529 --> 17:56.362
- It was them.
- You're all fired.

17:56.462 --> 17:58.396
- You... you can't
fire anyone!

17:58.496 --> 18:00.362
You're all rehired!

18:00.462 --> 18:03.262
- PEGSI, I am going
to walk out of here

18:03.362 --> 18:04.896
and pretend that this
never happened.

18:04.996 --> 18:08.696
You are going back to work
and will find that android,

18:08.796 --> 18:11.329
or you will end up
in the recycling bin

18:11.429 --> 18:14.396
with all of the other junk.

18:14.496 --> 18:16.129
You heard the man.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.496
Back to work.
I want results.

18:19.596 --> 18:23.329
Um, I may have something.

18:26.096 --> 18:28.996
- This is unreal.
- What did you find out?

18:29.096 --> 18:32.162
- That Tammy uses
way too many emojis.

18:32.262 --> 18:35.329
The good news is, there's
no sign of her knowing...

18:35.429 --> 18:37.629
...you're an android.

18:37.729 --> 18:38.562
Is this everything?

18:38.662 --> 18:40.696
- No, there is
something else.

18:40.796 --> 18:43.929
It is Tammy Gilroy's
super-secret eDiary.

18:44.029 --> 18:45.396
- What?

18:45.496 --> 18:48.096
- The file name indicates
that no one else...

18:48.196 --> 18:50.362
...is allowed to see this.

18:52.796 --> 18:54.462
I...

18:54.562 --> 18:56.996
I don't know how I feel
about reading it.

18:57.096 --> 19:01.362
On one hand, it's a major
invasion of Tammy's privacy,

19:01.462 --> 19:04.562
and on the other,
we need to keep you safe.

19:04.662 --> 19:07.396
- I don't see anything
on either of your hands.

19:07.496 --> 19:10.429
- I know. We'll just
read the parts about you.

19:17.629 --> 19:19.429
- I missed you
at lunch today.

19:19.529 --> 19:22.062
- You missed me? Awww...

19:22.162 --> 19:23.429
- Yeah, I have
a test tomorrow

19:23.529 --> 19:26.029
and I don't understand
any of this stuff.

19:26.129 --> 19:28.096
- Come on, Cole,
we've gone over this,

19:28.196 --> 19:30.396
like, a zillion times.

19:33.096 --> 19:34.362
- Let's take a break.

19:34.462 --> 19:36.629
I'm gonna run over and say
hello to Dayton and Frankie.

19:36.729 --> 19:38.529
B-R-B.
- N-O!

19:38.629 --> 19:40.229
If you wanna
pass that test,

19:40.329 --> 19:42.129
you don't have time
for socializing

19:42.229 --> 19:44.762
with obnoxious newbies.

19:44.896 --> 19:46.362
There's way
too much here.

19:46.462 --> 19:48.496
This will take forever.

19:48.596 --> 19:51.962
Can you search for
the word "secret"?

19:53.862 --> 19:55.529
There are 25 matches
for the word "secret."

19:55.629 --> 19:57.696
"Secret crush,"
"secret imaginary friend,"

19:57.796 --> 19:59.896
"secret crush on secret
imaginary friend."

19:59.996 --> 20:03.929
Oh, this one is relevant.

20:04.029 --> 20:05.429
- "Frankie must
have a secret.

20:05.529 --> 20:09.362
There's definitely no way
she's better than me at math."

20:09.462 --> 20:13.462
Okay, bring up the next one.

20:13.562 --> 20:15.929
- "How can her brain
sync that fast?

20:16.029 --> 20:17.796
"I'm going to reveal
her secret

20:17.896 --> 20:20.362
so everyone knows she's
not who she says she is."

20:20.462 --> 20:22.129
- But I am who I say I am.

20:22.229 --> 20:23.296
I am Frankie.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.129
- Okay, don't freak out!

20:25.229 --> 20:26.729
- I am not freaking out.

20:26.829 --> 20:28.562
- We still don't know
who she thinks you are.

20:28.662 --> 20:31.696
Um, skip ahead to, like,
the 15th secret.

20:33.162 --> 20:35.462
- Isn't this nice?

20:35.562 --> 20:37.262
I've missed helping you
with math, Cole.

20:37.362 --> 20:41.262
- Yeah, uh, me, too.

20:41.362 --> 20:43.596
Uh, I'm getting hungry.
Do you want anything?

20:43.696 --> 20:45.396
- Cole! Cole!

20:45.496 --> 20:47.962
That's it!

20:48.062 --> 20:49.629
This ends now.

20:49.729 --> 20:52.029
Forget math class.

20:52.129 --> 20:53.596
Let's see how much
Cole likes her

20:53.696 --> 20:55.629
when he finds out
she's a cheat.

20:55.729 --> 20:58.796
- "I know Frankie's secret.

20:58.896 --> 21:01.262
"Somebody is feeding her
the answers to math problems

21:01.362 --> 21:03.329
through a hidden earpiece."

21:04.762 --> 21:06.396
Do you know what
that means?

21:06.496 --> 21:08.029
- She thinks somebody
is feeding me answers

21:08.129 --> 21:09.496
through a hidden earpiece.

21:09.596 --> 21:12.796
- And if she thinks that's our
secret, we're in the clear.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.762
Ha!
- Ha!

21:14.896 --> 21:17.696
- "And my RF scanner
will prove it."

21:18.596 --> 21:22.096
Hold on. RF scanner?

21:22.196 --> 21:23.962
- An RF scanner
detects the presence

21:24.062 --> 21:26.296
of electromagnetic
radiation.

21:26.396 --> 21:30.162
- Uh-oh, electromagnetic
radiation...

21:30.262 --> 21:32.496
coming from you?

21:32.596 --> 21:34.496
Come on, we've gotta
get out of here.

21:34.596 --> 21:36.762
- Hey, sis.
Hey, Frankie.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.729
I knew it!

21:38.896 --> 21:41.896
You're leaking more
RF than a radio station.

21:41.996 --> 21:44.529
That's how you get
all your math answers.

21:44.629 --> 21:46.996
You're a cheater
and a fraud,

21:47.096 --> 21:49.496
and now everyone
knows your secret.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.729
