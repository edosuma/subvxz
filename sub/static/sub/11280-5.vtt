EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #027
"Everybody Hates Malvo"
CLOSED CAPTIONED

00:02.836 --> 00:04.438
CHRIS ROCK:
Working at Doc's Corner Store
was pretty easy.

00:04.472 --> 00:06.107
I stocked shelves...

00:06.140 --> 00:07.241
I delivered groceries...

00:07.275 --> 00:11.212
Now, hurry up, Chris, and
don't let her ice cream melt.

00:11.245 --> 00:14.148
...I even made pickled eggs.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.217
About the only job
Doc never let me do

00:16.250 --> 00:17.751
was work the register.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.753
Chris, listen here,

00:19.787 --> 00:21.489
I have to go and
do something.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.125
I'm going to have to leave
for about half an hour.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.126
Okay, I'll help you lock up.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.527
No, we're not
locking up.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.629
I want you
to stay here.

00:28.662 --> 00:31.199
You think you can handle
the register while I'm gone?

00:31.232 --> 00:33.667
For real?!
Where are you going?

00:33.701 --> 00:34.902
Got to go to the bank.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.638
Since Doc didn't leave the
store during business hours,

00:37.671 --> 00:39.540
he never got to go to the bank.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.442
I never knew
where he kept his money.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.144
That will be
a deposit.

00:43.177 --> 00:47.381
That mattress was his wallet.

00:47.415 --> 00:50.684
* Oh, money, money,
money, money... *

00:50.718 --> 00:53.554
I won't be gone long.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.190
Don't take any bills over $20,

00:56.224 --> 00:58.592
and count your change out loud.

00:58.626 --> 01:02.230
Lick your fingers, make sure
your bills don't stick.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.298
There's a bamboo stick
under the counter

01:04.332 --> 01:06.500
in case anybody give you
any trouble.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.369
Like who

01:08.402 --> 01:09.570
Bam!

01:09.603 --> 01:11.339
Boo!

01:11.372 --> 01:12.706
Got it?

01:12.740 --> 01:15.109
Got it.

01:15.143 --> 01:19.747
* He said, "Money's
too tight to mention" *

01:19.780 --> 01:24.252
* Oh, money, money,
money, money... *

01:24.285 --> 01:26.887
Can I help you?
* Money's too tight
to mention... *

01:26.920 --> 01:29.190
Yeah. Give me the money!

01:29.223 --> 01:30.224
Now!

01:30.258 --> 01:33.294
Malvo was the neighborhood's
repeat offender.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.528
He always committed crimes.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.366
Yeah, Shorty,
that's real argyle.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.567
He always got caught.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.169
Oh, Malvo!

01:41.202 --> 01:42.203
This is the police.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.439
And he always got out.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.675
See you next
time, Malvo.
All right.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.377
When Shawshank Redemption
came out,

01:49.410 --> 01:50.644
Malvo thought it was a comedy.

01:50.678 --> 01:51.812
Boy, hurry up!

01:51.845 --> 01:53.347
Okay, okay, okay.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.648
Just don't shoot me.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.385
Come on, man.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.353
Hmm.

01:59.387 --> 02:03.291
You ever notice how hard it is
to think when you're terrified?

02:07.795 --> 02:10.264
Boy, you don't even
want to do that.
He's right.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.732
$12? That's all
y'all got in there?

02:11.765 --> 02:13.267
Doc just went to the bank.

02:13.301 --> 02:16.370
Next time, y'all better have
more than $12 in there.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.438
I'm not playing, man.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.407
He's not even finished
robbing me this time,

02:19.440 --> 02:21.409
he's already planning
on the next time.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.677
Give me that,
and you better not tell nobody

02:23.711 --> 02:26.414
you just got robbed by Malvo.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.917
I'm also not telling anybody
what I just did in my pants.

02:29.950 --> 02:33.921
Captioning sponsored by
CBS Paramount
Network Television

03:02.816 --> 03:04.485
DOC:
I knew it,
I knew it!

03:04.518 --> 03:06.387
I knew I shouldn't
have left it.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.555
22 years.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.657
I've never left
that register alone

03:09.690 --> 03:10.891
with anybody else, yeah.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.260
Since the store opened.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.494
And the one day I do,

03:13.527 --> 03:14.662
I get robbed.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.464
I'm sorry, Doc.
I was gonna hit him

03:16.497 --> 03:17.831
with the bamboo stick,
but he took it.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.368
Chris, look, it's not
your fault. He had a gun.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.836
I'd much rather you
get robbed than shot.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.905
My pickled eggs.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.341
He took my pickled eggs!

03:27.375 --> 03:29.377
Now, who steals pickled eggs?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.211
Can I talk to you
a minute, son?

03:32.846 --> 03:35.449
Can you give me
a description of the guy?

03:35.483 --> 03:36.984
Yeah. He's the kind of guy
that kills you

03:37.017 --> 03:38.319
if you describe him
to the police.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.420
What did he look like?

03:39.453 --> 03:40.688
I was pretty scared.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.423
I don't really remember much.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.524
Do you remember anything?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.758
What color clothing he had on?

03:44.792 --> 03:45.993
Was he tall?
Short.

03:46.026 --> 03:46.694
Thin?
Fat.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.495
Dark?
Light.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.662
Thanks.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.332
If we get any leads,
we'll let you know.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.467
Yeah, considering
I just described Mini Me.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.404
You want me
to walk you home?

03:56.437 --> 03:58.706
No, I'm okay.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.612
Before people had TVs
in every room,

04:04.645 --> 04:06.480
families had to watch
television

04:06.514 --> 04:08.582
the old-fashioned way--
by taking turns.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.518
(dance music plays,
announcer speaks)

04:10.551 --> 04:12.520
(dance music plays,
announcer speaks)

04:12.553 --> 04:13.387
Stop!

04:13.421 --> 04:14.855
* Get down,
come on, get down... *

04:20.561 --> 04:22.396
Mama, Drew keeps
changing the channel.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.466
I told her I was gonna
let her watch it right after

04:25.499 --> 04:26.634
I got the hockey scores.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.502
Look, I don't care
what y'all are watching,

04:28.536 --> 04:31.539
long as y'all are done when Sue
Simmons comes on Live at Five.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.441
That all changed
when my father brought home

04:33.474 --> 04:36.410
the greatest technological
innovation we had ever seen.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.512
Hey, everybody.
Hey.

04:38.546 --> 04:41.415
I got a surprise.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.683
A Betamax!

04:42.716 --> 04:44.318
Didn't they stop making those?

04:44.352 --> 04:46.520
They sure did. That's how
I got it for half off.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.457
The only time my father ever
brought something new home

04:49.490 --> 04:51.459
was when it was old
to everybody else.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.427
I asked for a sewing machine.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.464
What the hell is this?

04:56.497 --> 04:57.865
A loom.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.700
What is that?

04:59.733 --> 05:01.034
JULIUS:
A stove.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.703
Well, if that's a stove,
where's the witch?

05:02.736 --> 05:04.004
I asked for a car.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.639
What the hell is this?

05:05.673 --> 05:06.640
A rickshaw.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.808
That's Rick.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.481
I wanted to tell my parents
that I got robbed,

05:13.514 --> 05:15.048
but I didn't want them
to worry.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.384
What's going on?

05:16.417 --> 05:17.485
Dad got a Betamax.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.587
Julius, what are we supposed
to do without the tapes?

05:19.620 --> 05:22.089
I got a bunch
of blank tapes with it.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.957
They were practically
giving it away.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.959
Probably throwing
them away.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.363
I'm gonna record
Billy Ocean videos.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.098
And I'm going
to record Knight Rider.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.299
And what are you going
to record, baby?

05:32.332 --> 05:36.069
The 700 Club, so I can pray
not to get robbed again.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.838
I don't know, maybe Rocky.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.440
JULIUS:
Y'all can do
whatever y'all want

05:39.473 --> 05:41.074
as long as
I can record my stories.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.110
Now my father could catch up
on his sleep

05:43.143 --> 05:44.478
and The Young
and the Restless.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.514
Let me see a tape.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.587
Hey, Chris,

05:53.621 --> 05:56.056
I brought you some old movies
we had left over.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.392
I've got Sharkey'sMachine
and Young Frankenstein.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.960
What's that?
It's a Mel Brooks movie.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.562
It's hilarious.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.564
Thanks.
No problem.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.566
We were using them
as doorstops.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.600
You okay?

06:06.634 --> 06:09.737
Let me ask
you a question.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.905
What would you do
if somebody robbed you,

06:11.939 --> 06:14.675
and you could identify them,
but you were afraid to?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.578
You got robbed?

06:17.611 --> 06:18.779
At the store.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.147
This guy named Malvo.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.582
He scared me to death.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.584
You know, there was
a similar situation

06:23.617 --> 06:24.985
in Sharkey's Machine.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.587
Burt Reynolds got ripped off,

06:26.620 --> 06:29.056
but he didn't want
to go to the cops.

06:29.089 --> 06:29.723
What did he do?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.024
He killed all the bad guys.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.726
Any other suggestions?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.595
Why don't you just go
tell Doc who this guy is

06:34.628 --> 06:35.763
and let him deal with it?

06:35.796 --> 06:36.897
'Cause he'll kill me.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.900
This guy is so bad,
he broke into prison.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.603
Sorry man, I don't know
what to tell you.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.706
Can you do me a favor?
What?

06:45.739 --> 06:48.075
Please don't tell anybody that
you talked to me about this.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.043
I don't want
the guy after me, too.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.647
* Ooh, shake it up...

06:53.681 --> 06:55.549
Hey, Bosco, I heard
you got a Betamax.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.518
Yeah. So?

06:57.551 --> 06:59.653
I've got a movie
for you, a comedy.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.657
Birth of a Nation?

07:03.691 --> 07:06.694
It's a classic.
Hilarious. You'll love it.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.062
Couldn't be any worse
than Soul Plane.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.531
Here we go.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.832
That's four cameras.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.634
Between that and
these stickers,

07:13.667 --> 07:15.936
a thief will stop
and think twice.

07:15.969 --> 07:19.139
It'd make Malvo stop and think
about stealing the cameras.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.709
Now, come on, let's
finish up these sketches.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.878
Yeah. So how did you learn
how to do this anyway?

07:24.912 --> 07:27.515
I started painting
nude portraits to meet chicks.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.716
Then...

07:28.749 --> 07:30.918
:
...I got good at it.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.186
A little darker
under the eyes.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.656
Okay. Now, is that him?

07:35.689 --> 07:36.890
Yeah, that's him.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.959
Chris, that's Al Jarreau.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.194
Now, come on now,
you got to focus.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.597
Every time we do this,
it comes out different.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.899
Now, first time,
this one look like...

07:45.933 --> 07:49.870
Yeah, ain't that look like
Kareem Abdul

07:50.771 --> 07:54.041
And that's George Jefferson.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.043
And ain't that
Lionel Richie?

07:56.076 --> 07:58.612
Come on, Chris.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.648
Look, let's just
start over.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.016
It was getting hard
to think of more people

08:03.050 --> 08:05.986
that didn't look like Malvo,
so I thought maybe it was time

08:06.019 --> 08:07.855
I just told Doc the truth.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.623
Hey, Hey, Malvo!
Hey, Doc.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.291
Uh.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.793
They-They let
you out again?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.629
Yeah. I got time off
for good behavior.

08:15.663 --> 08:18.131
That's like letting the devil
out of hell.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.667
DOC:
You keeping out
of trouble?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.735
I'm trying to.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.270
Man, I heard y'all got robbed.

08:23.303 --> 08:27.975
Yeah, and that fool got $12
and my pickled eggs.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.143
Now, who steals pickled eggs?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.780
So, who's this?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.615
DOC:
See, that's my
helper, Chris.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.017
Hmm.
Chris, say
hi to Malvo.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.151
Hi.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.553
Hi.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.221
Yeah, he was here
when it happened.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.724
He's helping me out with
a sketch of the guy who did it.

08:43.757 --> 08:44.758
Oh, yeah?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.894
Chris saw
who did it, huh?

08:46.927 --> 08:49.096
Let me see that.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.932
Here, this is the latest.

08:51.965 --> 08:55.002
Ain't this Al Jarreau?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.770
I know his record sales is down,

08:56.804 --> 08:58.806
but I don't think
he'd be robbing no store.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.841
I didn't really get
a good look at the guy.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.710
You must have been
scared, huh?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.645
Yeah, you can say that again.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.715
Well, I'll let y'all know
if I hear anything,

09:07.748 --> 09:09.783
'cause, you know,
I'm in them streets.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.685
Yeah, but you

09:11.719 --> 09:13.654
No, Doc.
I like them cameras, man.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.322
They work?

09:15.355 --> 09:17.124
Yeah.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.659
Well, I'll see you later, Chris.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.928
DOC:
Yeah, I got 'em hooked up.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.196
Got four here,
and, uh...

09:23.230 --> 09:26.166
and we're thinking about
putting two in the...

09:26.199 --> 09:28.736
I wish Burt Reynolds was here.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.809
While I was hoping
I'd never see Malvo again,

09:35.843 --> 09:37.110
my father couldn't wait to see

09:37.144 --> 09:38.712
The Young and the Restless
again.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.013
Here we go.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.082
TV ANNOUNCER:
Stay tuned for
The Young and The Restless.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.687
What

09:46.720 --> 09:49.990
Who recorded cartoons over my
Young and the Restless?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.826
I bought a Betamax
so everybody could enjoy it.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.028
I said you can tape
anything you want,

09:55.062 --> 09:58.699
all I want is one thing--
tape my stories.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.167
That's all.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.135
And I don't even get that?

10:02.169 --> 10:05.873
From now on, if the red light
is on that Betamax,

10:05.906 --> 10:06.940
don't you touch it.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.676
You hear me?

10:08.709 --> 10:10.010
Yes, Daddy.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.058
Uh-oh.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.660
What?

10:26.694 --> 10:29.697
:
I'm just trying
to tape my stories.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.764
Blah, blah, blah.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.199
Julius, she's 11.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.400
She made a mistake.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.836
So, what

10:35.869 --> 10:36.737
You get mad all the time.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.272
Exactly,
but everybody is used to it.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.308
If I did half the things
I threatened to do,

10:41.341 --> 10:43.844
don't you think I would've been
in jail a long time ago?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.045
What are you in for?

10:45.078 --> 10:48.048
Knocking my kid's nostrils off.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.850
You need to apologize.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.785
For what?
I didn't tape over her show.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.821
You are acting like a child.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.255
I am not.
Are, too.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.323
Am not.
You are, too.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.859
You can't jump to her defense
when she's wrong.

10:58.892 --> 10:59.993
If she was right,
I'd understand.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.796
:
Julius, that is not
what I'm trying to say.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.765
Then what are you trying to say?

11:04.798 --> 11:07.234
Well, if you don't know,
then forget it.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.703
Whoa, whoa, wait...
you-you can't be mad.

11:09.737 --> 11:10.904
I'm supposed to be mad.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.806
Rochelle.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.107
No...
Mama wins again.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.009
CHRIS:
No.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.311
No.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.347
Anybody?
No.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.315
I couldn't pick out a mug shot

11:22.349 --> 11:24.351
because I didn't want
to get shot.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.418
We'll do another canvas.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.854
I'll let you know
if we find anything.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.890
No, they won't.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.324
Chris...

11:31.358 --> 11:33.827
Chris, stop sweeping.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.830
We need to talk
right now.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.298
What's wrong?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.968
We went through a whole mug shot
book with that officer,

11:41.001 --> 11:44.004
and you couldn't find anybody
who even looked like the guy.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.840
Maybe he's not in the book.

11:46.874 --> 11:47.975
Would you tell
me if he was?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.877
Yeah.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.879
Chris, are you lying to me?

11:51.912 --> 11:54.848
No. Why would I need to lie?

11:54.882 --> 11:55.949
I don't know.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.517
But every time
I ask you a question,

11:57.550 --> 12:00.220
you're looking east and west
like you're waiting for a train.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.823
Now, Chris, if
you're in trouble,

12:02.856 --> 12:05.258
it's okay to
ask for help.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.094
I'm not in trouble.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.830
Then can you look me in the eye

12:09.863 --> 12:13.000
and tell me you don't know
who robbed my store?

12:13.033 --> 12:16.837
If I lied again,
Doc would never trust me.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.071
No.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.941
Okay.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.442
It's okay?

12:22.475 --> 12:23.811
No.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.146
You're fired, Chris.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.981
The truth shall set you free
all right...

12:28.015 --> 12:31.819
free to find another job.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.254
:
I got fired.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.824
Why, 'cause
you got robbed?

12:36.857 --> 12:38.391
'Cause I didn't tell
who robbed me.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.960
Well, who robbed you?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.161
I'm not gonna tell.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.996
Oh...

12:43.030 --> 12:45.065
Man, you lost your job.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.267
Wait till Dad finds out.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.270
All he's been doing lately
is bragging about you working.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.139
I mean, he was so happy.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.974
He's going to be sad now.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.576
I'll bet he was telling
everybody at his job

12:56.609 --> 12:58.311
how proud he was of you.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.313
He's going
to be so embarrassed.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.883
He'll never be able
to live that down.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.018
I mean, you lost
your first job.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.887
I mean,
I can't believe it.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.022
Just glad it wasn't me.

13:09.056 --> 13:12.059
Thank you. A lot.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.426
It wasn't going to be easy

13:13.460 --> 13:15.562
telling my father
I'd lost my first job.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.398
He was still working
on the first job he ever had.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.304
Thanks, Julius.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.107
See you later, Miss Wilson.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.575
Hey, Dad.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.943
My man.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.011
How's work going?

13:31.044 --> 13:33.413
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.983
You know I proud of you
for keeping that job, son.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.086
It took a lot of courage for you
to walk back in that store.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.153
Thanks.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.455
Do they sell Soap Opera Digest
at your job?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.957
Yeah.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.558
When you go to work tomorrow,
pick me up a copy.

13:46.593 --> 13:50.030
Is there something else
you wanted to talk to me about?

13:50.063 --> 13:52.966
Oh, no, it's all right.
Forget about it.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.968
Okay.
My father being proud of me

13:55.002 --> 13:59.372
meant more than anything,
except being shot by Malvo.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.013
I figured it'd be easier
to take a beating from Mavlo

14:06.046 --> 14:08.015
than to tell my dad
I'd lost my job.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.617
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

14:10.650 --> 14:13.486
I don't know if you
can, but you may.

14:13.520 --> 14:18.191
While in prison, Malvo got a
PhD in Comparative Literature.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.328
I-I was wondering
if you could,

14:21.361 --> 14:24.131
just, you know, out of
the kindness of your heart,

14:24.164 --> 14:27.400
return the stuff
that you stole from Doc's?

14:33.073 --> 14:35.575
He laughed like
he was watching The Jeffersons,

14:35.608 --> 14:38.045
with the original Lionel.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.348
Forget it.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.615
No, no, wait, kid.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.184
Wait, wait, come here.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.252
Man, you funny, man.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.121
You-you should be a comedian
when you grow up, kid.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.256
That was funny, man.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.024
Get over here, boy.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.660
Man, what are you doing?!

14:53.693 --> 14:55.128
You got a wire on, boy?

14:55.162 --> 14:56.596
A what? No.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.098
My bad, man.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.233
Look-look, man,
let-let me explain

15:00.267 --> 15:03.036
some basic economic
theory to you, all right?

15:03.070 --> 15:06.106
In life, there are
people who make things,

15:06.139 --> 15:09.009
and then there are other
people who take things.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.277
I would be a taker.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.480
But, I also can be a breaker.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.115
But never, ever a faker.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.449
You follow me?

15:16.483 --> 15:18.085
Not really.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.653
Okay, well, let me explain
another economic theory:

15:20.687 --> 15:23.190
the stuff that I stole is mine.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.258
Beat it.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.496
But you funny though, kid.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.199
You funny.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.235
Give it back.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.670
Back at home, my father
was done being mad at Tonya,

15:37.704 --> 15:40.107
but she had just started
getting mad at him.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.408
You want
some ice cream?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.210
No.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.145
You want some
ice cream, baby?

15:45.178 --> 15:46.613
Yes, Mama.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.149
My father knew he had
to do something

15:49.182 --> 15:50.283
or this would go on forever.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.987
Tonya, can you plug in my heart?

15:54.021 --> 15:56.056
No. And if you axe me again,

15:56.089 --> 15:58.391
I'm gonna turn off
your stories.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.161
You smell ice cream?

16:09.136 --> 16:10.703
Baby?

16:10.737 --> 16:12.072
Say you're sorry.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.574
What for?
I didn't do nothing to her.

16:14.607 --> 16:18.411
It's not what you did,
it's how you did it.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.181
Julius, since day one,
she's been your little princess,

16:21.214 --> 16:23.116
and all of a sudden
you're screaming at her?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.085
I didn't scream.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.153
Julius, as big as you are--

16:26.186 --> 16:28.121
you weren't even talking to me
and I was scared.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.457
The one thing I learned about
women from my father is,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.992
even when you're right,
you're wrong.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.066
Uh, Doc?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.201
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

16:41.234 --> 16:45.305
I don't know if you can,
but you may.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.607
I'm sorry for not telling you
who robbed the store.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.776
I was scared.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.278
And you're not scared now?

16:51.311 --> 16:52.479
I want my job back.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.314
So who was it then?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.349
It was Malvo.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.151
Malvo?
Man, would you be quiet?

16:58.185 --> 16:59.552
Come inside, boy.

16:59.586 --> 17:00.787
Now why didn't you say so?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.255
Because he showed
his gun to me

17:02.289 --> 17:03.523
and he threatened
to kill me.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.557
Exactly my point.

17:04.591 --> 17:08.361
That Malvo is crazier
than three dogs with rabies.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.831
Don't worry, you can
have your job back.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.300
What are you doing?

17:13.333 --> 17:15.802
I'm calling the police.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.775
Tonya?

17:32.319 --> 17:34.321
Listen...

17:34.354 --> 17:37.190
the other day, I didn't
mean to holler at you.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.326
I was upset.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.594
I was looking forward
to seeing my stories.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.396
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings,

17:43.430 --> 17:46.599
but my feelings
were hurt, too.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.236
I didn't mean to do it.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.171
I didn't mean to yell at you.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.539
I didn't mean to do
a lot of things,

17:52.572 --> 17:53.806
but that never
stopped my father

17:53.840 --> 17:55.475
from smacking me
upside the head.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.809
I'm sorry.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.178
Me, too.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.717
Why do you watch soap operas
anyway?

18:04.751 --> 18:05.385
What?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.387
Isn't daytime TV for women?

18:07.420 --> 18:10.190
Um...

18:10.223 --> 18:11.658
We'll talk about that
another time.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.325
All right?

18:12.359 --> 18:13.693
Okay.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.233
Since there were no witnesses
to the crime,

18:20.267 --> 18:22.635
the only way to catch Malvo
was to catch him in the act.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.337
You ready?

18:24.371 --> 18:26.173
Um, I don't
know about this.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.374
Listen, look,
don't worry about nothing.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.441
I'll be right here.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.377
If he tries anything,

18:30.410 --> 18:32.745
hit him with this bag
of quarters.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.557
Yo, Chris.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.526
Doc go to the bank again?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.828
No, he doesn't go
till tomorrow.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.265
Is he here?

18:52.299 --> 18:53.666
CHRIS:
No.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.701
So...

18:54.734 --> 18:56.769
the money is here and he gone?

18:56.803 --> 18:57.704
Right.

18:57.737 --> 19:01.774
Then you need to give up
the money to Malvo.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.647
Freeze!

19:07.680 --> 19:08.848
Don't move.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.584
You set me up, boy.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.953
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

19:17.324 --> 19:18.291
Hold it right there.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.498
That's right,
I'm the bad guy.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.302
Man, you didn't
even have a real gun?

19:29.336 --> 19:32.405
It's hard to rob a gun store,
man, they got guns.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.274
MALVO:
It's a catch-22 for Malvo.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.742
OFFICER:
Read him his rights.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.713
Hey, where you going
with my quarters?

19:40.747 --> 19:42.315
It's evidence, now.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.616
Stand back, sir.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.319
Doc never did get
his quarters back.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.455
Later that year,
the Bed-Stuy police department

19:48.488 --> 19:50.257
won a video game tournament.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.329
We're number one!

19:57.564 --> 19:58.898
Oh, thanks, Chris.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.233
You know, you did a good job.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.668
No problem.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.371
Being scared cost me my job,
my father's admiration

20:04.404 --> 20:07.006
and that was too high
of a price for me.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.841
So, I learned
right then and there

20:08.875 --> 20:10.310
that when you're in trouble,

20:10.343 --> 20:12.245
don't be afraid
to ask for help.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.346
Chris.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.414
When I get out,

20:14.447 --> 20:15.948
I'm coming after you.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.551
Y-O-O.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.290
:
Help...!

20:23.323 --> 20:26.293
