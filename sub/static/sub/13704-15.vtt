WEBVTT

00:54.387 --> 00:56.956
Everything becomes okay

00:57.357 --> 01:00.293
The painful memories disappear

01:06.933 --> 01:09.803
I become happy again

01:09.869 --> 01:12.539
A smile spreads on my face

01:19.679 --> 01:22.682
Everything becomes okay

01:22.749 --> 01:25.452
The painful memories disappear

01:26.853 --> 01:32.225
When I'm with you

01:32.292 --> 01:34.894
I become happy again

01:35.195 --> 01:38.598
A smile spreads on my face

01:50.743 --> 01:54.080
CONCERT FOR PATIENTS

02:34.854 --> 02:35.855
It must be a lot of pressure

02:36.723 --> 02:38.358
to go right after JB.

02:40.426 --> 02:41.728
I just need one person

02:42.595 --> 02:44.964
to listen carefully to my song.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.634
It's our turn.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.671
Let's go.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.213
You don't have to hold hands.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.961
You did a great job today.

03:15.662 --> 03:16.529
Congratulations.

03:17.931 --> 03:21.968
I take back what I said
about how you can't do anything.

03:24.604 --> 03:25.972
You wrote a great song.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.943
I want first dibs on your next song.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.512
I'll sing that too.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.882
That would be an honor.

03:37.183 --> 03:39.152
You're pretending to be all nice again.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.387
Go on out.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.591
Go on.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.462
You should be the one
tying up all the loose ends.

04:06.746 --> 04:07.847
What's wrong?

04:08.848 --> 04:09.916
Are you mad at me?

04:11.184 --> 04:12.151
What's wrong?

04:12.952 --> 04:13.820
Come on.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.591
You asked me to do a duet.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.861
Why didn't you give me
the full information?

04:23.463 --> 04:26.633
Why didn't you say that Rian
would be singing with me and not you?

04:28.735 --> 04:29.569
Sorry.

04:31.537 --> 04:34.073
If you're sorry, buy me lunch.

04:34.774 --> 04:35.608
What?

04:37.076 --> 04:38.177
You made a promise.

04:44.717 --> 04:46.352
Hello, everyone.

04:47.086 --> 04:52.392
I wrote this song for one person
and that person only.

04:52.925 --> 04:56.829
I have been devoted
to this person all along,

04:57.530 --> 04:59.932
and I want to continue
being her devoted admirer,

05:00.099 --> 05:01.734
like a sunflower to the sun.

05:36.736 --> 05:41.207
When will the rain stop

05:43.443 --> 05:47.747
Getting between our love

05:49.882 --> 05:54.354
You're high up in the sky

05:56.656 --> 06:01.027
While I'm down here
At the lowest of the low

06:16.743 --> 06:21.013
But still, I've been happy

06:23.483 --> 06:27.687
That I can receive the warm rays

06:30.223 --> 06:34.394
You shower on me

06:36.829 --> 06:40.967
That I can gaze up at you

06:44.237 --> 06:48.574
I am only looking at you

06:49.242 --> 06:52.345
But why do clouds gather

06:52.478 --> 06:55.481
And soak me with rain?

06:55.548 --> 07:02.155
As I wilt, it gets hard
For me to look up at you

07:02.488 --> 07:08.694
To be able to see you again
I have to wait through four seasons

07:12.131 --> 07:15.001
Grow

07:18.905 --> 07:21.574
Grow tall

07:22.175 --> 07:28.281
Keep growing,

07:28.448 --> 07:35.455
So that I can see her up close

07:38.491 --> 07:45.498
See her up close

08:27.607 --> 08:29.242
Why did you come
if you were going to run away?

08:36.249 --> 08:37.450
It was me who ran away.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.954
If you couldn't hold me back then,

08:42.154 --> 08:43.289
shouldn't you be doing so now?

08:44.991 --> 08:46.125
Isn't that what a mom should do?

08:47.727 --> 08:48.728
Yu-jin...

08:55.034 --> 08:56.369
Listen to my song before you go.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.238
Please.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.625
I lied.

09:23.629 --> 09:27.767
I lied that my parents had passed away.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.288
The rumors are true.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.558
I'm the child actor Jin Yu-jin
who played New Clear Man.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.596
I was ashamed.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.633
That's why I spent the last ten years

10:01.667 --> 10:03.869
running away from my past.

10:05.504 --> 10:06.339
What?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.140
The rumors were true?

10:09.408 --> 10:11.544
He didn't have to hide it from us.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.582
It must have been tough
for him to bear it all alone.

10:20.453 --> 10:24.123
I'm sure that it was very hard
for my mother

10:25.891 --> 10:27.393
to have a pathetic, lying son.

10:29.895 --> 10:33.466
But she kept it all inside.
I dedicate this song to her.

10:56.656 --> 11:03.162
I'm sorry

11:07.033 --> 11:11.103
Yet another day

11:11.837 --> 11:14.440
Went by like this

11:16.676 --> 11:21.180
The nervousness I can't overcome

11:21.881 --> 11:27.286
The anxiousness that won't go away

11:27.353 --> 11:30.156
My growing yearning

11:30.222 --> 11:37.229
And lines that can't be crossed

11:37.930 --> 11:44.937
I'm still hesitating like always

11:45.905 --> 11:50.242
You're radiant like always

11:50.509 --> 11:56.449
That's probably why I can't approach you

11:58.584 --> 12:00.219
You are

12:01.454 --> 12:05.791
Too free

12:06.659 --> 12:11.130
I just can't get close to you

12:11.197 --> 12:17.303
That's probably why I watch you from afar

12:19.171 --> 12:25.111
That's probably why I hide my feelings

12:34.620 --> 12:36.422
I'm still

12:37.590 --> 12:41.894
Hesitating like always

12:42.628 --> 12:46.866
You're radiant like always

12:47.199 --> 12:53.372
That's probably why I can't approach you

12:55.274 --> 12:56.742
You are

12:58.144 --> 13:02.381
Too free

13:03.315 --> 13:07.553
I just can't get close to you

13:07.953 --> 13:13.959
That's probably why I watch you from afar

13:15.928 --> 13:22.935
That's probably why I hide my feelings

14:13.252 --> 14:14.220
Yu-jin.

14:15.988 --> 14:16.822
Are you crying?

14:18.090 --> 14:18.958
Are you?

14:19.692 --> 14:20.526
Are you really crying?

14:22.127 --> 14:23.729
Hey, come on.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.164
Good job.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.267
You listened to my advice.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.470
Do you like me?

14:33.739 --> 14:34.773
Did I do well?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.912
See? Isn't it nice to listen
to your wiser friend

14:39.979 --> 14:41.380
and reach out to your mom?

14:41.447 --> 14:42.681
You're a good boy.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.717
What a good boy.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.657
Slow down. You'll choke on your food.

14:52.124 --> 14:52.958
Here.

15:00.766 --> 15:01.867
You should eat too.

15:03.102 --> 15:03.936
Okay.

15:13.445 --> 15:15.347
Eat with those.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.152
Why? Do you not want to?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.055
You can't eat with those?

15:24.490 --> 15:25.391
You know,

15:26.258 --> 15:28.794
-we're--
-We're still together.

15:30.896 --> 15:34.500
You might have said that it's over
between us, but I don't agree.

15:37.202 --> 15:41.440
You promised to treat me
to good food and send me apples.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.475
You said you would do whatever I asked.

15:48.547 --> 15:51.784
I've treated you to lunch,
and I'll send you apples.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.020
Promise.

15:57.723 --> 15:58.958
My injury is serious.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.195
Please stay with me
until my leg gets better.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.070
You promised, okay?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.613
The person whose name
I'm about to announce

16:22.214 --> 16:24.817
will be the final member
of the Super Idol group.

16:29.822 --> 16:34.293
This person also received
the most votes in this round.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.064
The last super idol is...

16:50.342 --> 16:51.243
Rian.

17:10.963 --> 17:15.501
JB, who performed with Rian,
also took first place in this round.

17:17.403 --> 17:21.874
But since JB and Na-na
are not well enough to perform just yet,

17:23.242 --> 17:24.977
we will give them another chance later on.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.863
One month from now,

17:45.831 --> 17:48.467
there will be an audition
to pick one super idol

17:49.001 --> 17:51.537
to perform the opening act
at the EMG World Tour.

17:52.838 --> 17:58.277
The six selected super idols,
plus Na-na and JB can try out.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.781
Don't be satisfied
with your performances today.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.151
I look forward to
even better performances next month.

18:13.358 --> 18:14.193
EMG?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.295
Oh, that!

18:17.696 --> 18:19.898
Song Sam-dong took first place last year.

18:19.965 --> 18:20.799
Oh, right.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.569
He took the stage name K
and released an album through EMG.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.804
And then he won a Grammy.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.243
Be careful.

18:36.515 --> 18:37.349
This is great.

18:38.550 --> 18:39.384
Here.

18:45.390 --> 18:46.725
So, now that I got an apple,

18:47.726 --> 18:48.994
my leg just has to heal.

18:49.495 --> 18:50.329
Right?

18:50.562 --> 18:51.396
Yes.

18:52.097 --> 18:52.998
Shin Hae-seong,

18:54.233 --> 18:55.434
I'd like to have a word with you.

18:58.003 --> 19:02.474
Your first song "Hello to Myself"
was included in Yenny's album,

19:03.709 --> 19:05.344
and your second song "Together"

19:05.677 --> 19:07.579
came in first place
at the Super Idol Audition.

19:09.014 --> 19:11.817
As a novice songwriter,
you've scored a major success.

19:12.751 --> 19:13.585
Congratulations.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.188
Thank you.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.026
Your songs have great popular appeal.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.530
While technical improvements can be made,

19:25.364 --> 19:27.166
your songs have the power to move people.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.536
And so, I was thinking...

19:31.570 --> 19:33.805
Do you have any intention
of studying songwriting?

19:35.741 --> 19:37.442
I still have a long way to go,

19:38.076 --> 19:40.512
but I would love to try it out
if given the chance.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.487
This is the application form
for a prep program at Berklee.

19:49.955 --> 19:54.026
I also got a six-month internship position
for you at EMG America.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.267
When does the internship start?

20:02.701 --> 20:04.369
The sooner the better.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.907
It has to be filled before long,
otherwise, the position will be taken.

20:10.075 --> 20:13.645
The new school semester begins next month,

20:13.946 --> 20:15.347
so you should decide by this month.

20:16.315 --> 20:17.149
Well...

20:18.083 --> 20:20.385
I'm grateful
for the great opportunity, but...

20:20.552 --> 20:22.387
I heard your dream
was to become a singer...

20:23.922 --> 20:25.057
when you can't even sing.

20:26.858 --> 20:29.127
You finally found your talent.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.364
Are you going to miss out
on this amazing opportunity?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.435
A chance like this doesn't come often.

20:41.506 --> 20:44.743
I can't believe
the audition is already over.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.745
Everyone worked so hard.

20:48.046 --> 20:49.881
You're amazing, Ms. Ahn.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.285
You managed to whip
your clowns into shape.

20:54.686 --> 20:57.122
You didn't have it easy, either.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.023
Right?

20:59.491 --> 21:00.325
What's that?

21:01.927 --> 21:03.128
-What?
-What is it?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.767
Really? You're going to
try out for KBC Star?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.469
No.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.571
I was going to just recommend some kids.

21:12.638 --> 21:13.705
Come on.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.575
What's the problem? You should go for it.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.612
You shouldn't waste
your exceptional talent on karaoke.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.848
-Really?
-Yes.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.553
Watching the kids audition
lit up the fire inside me.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.523
I think I'll regret it
if I don't give it a go.

21:32.591 --> 21:33.859
Who cares about age?

21:34.326 --> 21:35.160
Go for it.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.196
Yes, you should. It will be a lot of fun.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.531
We'll help you.

21:39.698 --> 21:41.099
-Really?
-Of course.

22:01.553 --> 22:03.055
None of those colleges are to your liking?

22:07.959 --> 22:09.194
I won't go to college.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.267
Then what will you do?

22:16.868 --> 22:17.869
I'll be a celebrity manager.

22:18.236 --> 22:19.338
Good grief.

22:20.572 --> 22:23.975
It's not for anyone. It's a lot of work.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.578
You have to attend all your singers' gigs,

22:26.645 --> 22:28.213
clean up after them
if they get into trouble,

22:28.480 --> 22:31.616
and handle temper tantrums.
It's physically and mentally tough.

22:32.918 --> 22:33.985
But you did it.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.122
I'll work for you and learn the ropes.

22:37.489 --> 22:40.792
That's why you need to get
a management degree at college.

22:40.859 --> 22:44.596
Even if I graduate from college,
I'll end up working for you anyway.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.699
I'll do the same thing
one way or the other.

22:49.401 --> 22:50.836
So, what's the point of going to college?

22:52.437 --> 22:53.372
For the diploma?

23:00.645 --> 23:01.480
All right.

23:02.147 --> 23:03.048
Let's do this.

23:04.449 --> 23:07.319
You can follow the super idols
to learn the ropes.

23:08.587 --> 23:12.124
If you manage to get even one gig
for them on your own,

23:12.324 --> 23:13.525
I'll let you decide about college.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.528
Really? You mean it, right?

23:23.368 --> 23:24.336
WEAKNESS = STRENGTH

23:24.403 --> 23:27.773
You're now going to be
performing as a group.

23:29.107 --> 23:31.810
What's the most important thing
when it comes working as a team?

23:32.210 --> 23:33.044
Trust?

23:33.812 --> 23:36.515
Hope? Love?

23:37.249 --> 23:38.383
It's teamwork.

23:44.790 --> 23:50.896
What I'm saying is, you need to trust
and care about one another.

23:51.329 --> 23:54.199
And how can you do that?

23:54.299 --> 23:57.068
Over time, you may find something
you dislike about your group members.

23:57.502 --> 24:01.173
But when that happens,
you need to find the positive

24:01.239 --> 24:02.441
in what you perceived as negative.

24:03.575 --> 24:06.545
Let's take Ui-bong.
What do you most dislike about him?

24:07.045 --> 24:08.580
What's there to dislike?

24:09.748 --> 24:13.318
He's so cute when he's quiet,
but when he opens his mouth,

24:14.619 --> 24:17.689
his dialect makes him
sound like a bumpkin.

24:18.590 --> 24:22.160
Right? His dialect is very strong.

24:22.227 --> 24:25.864
But is there anything
positive about his dialect?

24:26.731 --> 24:29.468
It makes him approachable.

24:29.668 --> 24:30.735
-Absolutely.
-That's right.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.605
And the fans would like that about him.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.441
Ui-bong could help the group
get fans in Gyeongsang Province.

24:36.508 --> 24:37.509
You're right.

24:38.810 --> 24:39.811
See?

24:39.978 --> 24:42.447
Next. What about Hong-ju?

24:42.848 --> 24:44.783
What do you most dislike about him?

24:46.918 --> 24:49.721
He's not like a teen idol.
He looks way too old.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.291
A mature-looking teen idol.

24:54.593 --> 24:56.928
Is there anything positive
about his appearance?

24:57.996 --> 25:01.466
That's what got him to make
great music like "B-Grade Life."

25:02.200 --> 25:03.034
That's right.

25:04.102 --> 25:06.738
Is there anything
that you dislike about Yu-jin?

25:06.805 --> 25:08.807
-Me.
-Me.

25:09.908 --> 25:10.809
Okay.

25:11.276 --> 25:12.711
He's stubborn as a mule.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.147
Right.

25:16.214 --> 25:18.884
And there's his dark past
as New Clear Man.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.086
Why did you mention that?

25:21.286 --> 25:25.190
Is there anything positive
about his stubbornness?

25:25.257 --> 25:26.291
None.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.262
Geniuses tend to be stubborn.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.498
It's better than being modest,
but unable to write good songs.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.001
I suppose.

25:36.468 --> 25:39.971
Lastly, is there anything
you don't like about Rian?

25:41.606 --> 25:43.074
Absolutely nothing.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.876
She thinks her face is a canvas.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.478
She wears crap on her eyes.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.313
She's rude.

25:50.649 --> 25:54.185
And is there anything positive
about her rudeness?

25:59.524 --> 26:00.759
Is rudeness ever positive?

26:00.825 --> 26:01.726
No.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.929
Right. I doubt we'll find anything
redeeming about rudeness.

26:07.766 --> 26:08.733
Hey, guys.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.770
I'm your manager as of today.

26:11.870 --> 26:12.704
What?

26:46.204 --> 26:48.273
You are 186cm tall
and your weight is 72kg.

26:48.974 --> 26:50.542
You have mannequin proportions.

26:50.675 --> 26:52.544
I'm just setting the standard.

26:52.877 --> 26:54.145
You must work out a lot.

26:54.713 --> 26:55.780
Manager Lee,

26:56.181 --> 27:00.151
I was actually born with six-pack abs.

27:07.525 --> 27:09.160
I should measure your belly.

27:13.932 --> 27:16.001
Your weight is 75.1kg.

27:18.003 --> 27:19.604
You need to go on a diet.

27:21.006 --> 27:23.908
I had a big lunch.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.177
You must have eaten a whole cow.

27:26.244 --> 27:27.312
There's a cow in you.

27:33.518 --> 27:34.386
Hang on.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.920
You're not a stylist.

27:36.454 --> 27:37.389
Why are you doing this?

27:38.423 --> 27:41.493
It's only a waste to hire someone new.
You have to be frugal.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.428
You're worse than your dad.

27:44.796 --> 27:45.797
Hey.

27:46.431 --> 27:49.100
How can a girl touch a man just like that?

27:49.334 --> 27:50.235
Watch it.

27:50.301 --> 27:52.904
-Good grief.
-Hold up.

27:57.709 --> 27:58.677
What the...

28:07.919 --> 28:08.987
-Hello.
-Hello.

28:09.054 --> 28:10.655
Hi, kids. Have you been doing well?

28:11.222 --> 28:12.157
One, two, three.

28:12.590 --> 28:17.595
Nice to meet you. We're Super Idol.
We'll cause a K-pop storm.

28:20.231 --> 28:22.467
It's a welcome storm here,

28:23.868 --> 28:25.837
but I see catastrophe here.

28:26.938 --> 28:28.006
Are you guys really one group?

28:28.807 --> 28:30.308
Yes. I'm their manager.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.510
Why did you put together
a group like this?

28:33.244 --> 28:35.346
You guys look very different on screen.

28:36.181 --> 28:39.984
You have a very long way to go

28:40.585 --> 28:44.389
to make yourselves TV-ready.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.134
You're back again.

28:56.201 --> 28:57.302
You're so devoted.

28:57.502 --> 28:59.037
-How are you?
-Good.

29:05.777 --> 29:09.681
The rotator was in bad shape
even before the accident.

29:11.149 --> 29:14.285
There's no telling what may happen

29:14.719 --> 29:16.421
if you take up strenuous dancing
or sports again.

29:16.521 --> 29:19.390
In the worst-case scenario,
you may become mobility-impaired.

29:24.929 --> 29:28.500
You should strengthen your muscles
through physical therapy

29:28.933 --> 29:30.602
to compensate for the damage.

29:37.809 --> 29:40.044
You finally found your talent.

29:40.545 --> 29:43.314
Are you going to miss out
on this amazing opportunity?

29:44.082 --> 29:45.617
A chance like this doesn't come often.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.091
Congratulations!

29:53.158 --> 29:54.492
Your cast is finally off.

29:54.826 --> 29:55.660
Are you okay?

29:57.829 --> 30:01.132
And if I am, are you going
to run away from me again?

30:02.634 --> 30:03.968
The doctor said I wasn't okay.

30:04.602 --> 30:06.037
I need more treatment.

30:09.073 --> 30:11.209
You are okay, right?

30:13.077 --> 30:14.412
I'm not.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.315
I might die.

30:40.772 --> 30:42.707
They seem very nervous.

30:44.108 --> 30:45.643
I'm reminded of my trainee days.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.680
They have a long way to go
to catch up to us.

30:50.081 --> 30:52.383
As a superior, it's your chance
to tell them what they need to do.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.354
This will be fun.

31:00.425 --> 31:04.329
You have to mind
your facial expression all the time.

31:04.963 --> 31:07.398
You can't let your guard down
even for a moment

31:07.899 --> 31:09.634
just in case someone recognizes you.

31:10.802 --> 31:14.873
There will be cameras flashing
all around you without stopping.

31:15.807 --> 31:18.343
You can't let your guard down
even when you breathe in and out.

31:18.843 --> 31:20.678
When you do...

31:24.883 --> 31:27.552
An awful photo of you
will circulate online.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.122
This is awesome. Can I have it?

31:31.189 --> 31:32.090
Hey!

31:32.657 --> 31:36.027
You need to maintain composure
at all times.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.897
What's with your posture?
Back straight, chin in.

31:39.764 --> 31:41.666
Good.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.167
-Good?
-Yes.

31:43.501 --> 31:44.669
-It's good?
-Yes.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.974
I:dn's comeback single
is said to be plagiarized.

31:53.177 --> 31:56.447
Is it true that Jeong Ui-bong,
a former backup dancer,

31:56.514 --> 31:57.348
is better than you?

32:00.485 --> 32:01.319
Better than me?

32:03.388 --> 32:06.991
Rumor has it that it was you
who got dumped by Rian.

32:07.325 --> 32:08.159
Me?

32:09.060 --> 32:11.029
People say that Jin Yu-jin
and Shin Hae-seong are dating.

32:25.543 --> 32:28.179
Wait a minute. Is that a good example?

32:29.180 --> 32:30.982
That's a terrible example.

32:32.917 --> 32:37.422
He wasn't like that when he started.
He has to get his act together.

32:39.057 --> 32:42.827
People say that you don't like teen idols
when you're an idol yourself.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.795
Is it true?

32:44.595 --> 32:45.430
Me?

32:46.831 --> 32:49.167
Didn't you say it's awful to do
what you're told

32:49.701 --> 32:52.203
without any passion for music,

32:53.438 --> 32:55.073
just to become famous?

32:55.773 --> 32:57.008
Did I?

32:58.409 --> 33:01.479
People say you told Shin Hae-seong
you liked her, but got rejected.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.215
Hey!

33:04.949 --> 33:08.353
Did you have to tell him that?

33:08.419 --> 33:09.253
I didn't.

33:10.688 --> 33:11.522
What?

33:11.789 --> 33:13.591
You really said that you liked her?

33:13.992 --> 33:14.959
I don't know.

33:32.477 --> 33:33.344
"Shin Hae-seong.

33:34.545 --> 33:35.480
Certificate of admission."

33:46.090 --> 33:46.958
What's this?

33:50.461 --> 33:51.596
"Berklee"?

33:53.364 --> 33:56.134
You've really come a long way.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.369
I didn't think any school
would accept you,

33:58.736 --> 34:00.838
but you got into
this prestigious American school.

34:00.905 --> 34:02.507
Good job.

34:02.573 --> 34:04.142
Looking out for you sure was worth it.

34:07.912 --> 34:09.080
Give it back.

34:13.051 --> 34:13.885
Well...

34:15.053 --> 34:16.421
I'm not going to go to that school.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.157
You're not?

34:19.891 --> 34:20.725
No.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.496
I don't have to study in the States.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.099
I can make good music in Korea,

34:28.332 --> 34:31.269
and people can come from abroad
if they want my songs.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.038
Do you know you're making no sense?

34:35.773 --> 34:37.408
Well, then. I'll just rip this up.

34:41.045 --> 34:41.879
Fine.

34:45.983 --> 34:47.985
See? You were lying.

34:48.586 --> 34:50.555
What if I really ripped it up?

34:50.621 --> 34:52.123
You startled me.

34:52.623 --> 34:53.491
Give it back.

34:53.558 --> 34:54.492
Come on.

34:59.297 --> 35:00.131
Just go.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.103
I want to brag to everyone
that my friend is a famous songwriter.

35:23.187 --> 35:24.021
I can't do this.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.923
No. Don't lose focus.

35:25.990 --> 35:27.225
What am I going to do?

35:27.892 --> 35:29.193
I'm really scared.

35:29.894 --> 35:30.895
I can't do this.

35:32.096 --> 35:32.930
Hey.

35:33.197 --> 35:34.565
Follow my lead.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.033
Just trust me.

35:42.507 --> 35:43.975
Imagine I'm the only one in the audience.

35:44.342 --> 35:45.243
Look at no one but me.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.992
-Break a leg!
-You too

36:02.693 --> 36:04.195
-Break a leg!
-That hurts.

36:04.562 --> 36:07.431
Make sure the in-ear monitor
is in place and check the mic.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.002
That's right. And don't get distracted

36:11.235 --> 36:12.570
by the screaming girls.

36:12.737 --> 36:13.804
I won't.

36:14.038 --> 36:16.174
I'm quite experienced too,
so leave me alone.

36:17.475 --> 36:20.745
-Are you? Good boy.
-Hey!

36:21.679 --> 36:23.314
Good boy.

36:23.581 --> 36:24.649
Congratulations on your debut.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.120
What is this?

36:29.420 --> 36:30.321
Are you two dating?

36:30.388 --> 36:31.889
-What?
-What?

36:32.890 --> 36:36.460
He's just a good friend.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.867
Maybe more than...

36:45.703 --> 36:46.604
just friends.

36:48.105 --> 36:48.940
Why do you ask?

36:49.240 --> 36:51.509
-Are you jealous?
-Why would I be jealous?

36:52.543 --> 36:53.678
Take good care of Rian.

36:54.011 --> 36:55.413
She's a lot more fragile than she looks.

37:01.118 --> 37:02.620
This is perfect timing.

37:02.954 --> 37:03.788
For what?

37:03.854 --> 37:05.389
I beat you.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.193
It's perfect timing for you to kneel.

37:13.931 --> 37:15.466
You're so pathetic.

37:15.866 --> 37:18.269
Who would break their leg
so that they won't have to kneel?

37:18.536 --> 37:19.904
How sick can one be?

37:20.371 --> 37:22.073
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

37:25.076 --> 37:27.011
Stop.

37:29.313 --> 37:30.147
No?

37:37.655 --> 37:39.056
Super Idol, you're on standby.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.828
Just be yourself. Don't get nervous.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.863
You don't have to act
like you're my mentor.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.433
Is your leg okay?

37:49.600 --> 37:51.102
Of course.

37:51.736 --> 37:53.938
The doctor said
I would make a quick recovery.

37:58.542 --> 37:59.477
Good luck.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.212
-Thanks.
-Good luck!

38:01.545 --> 38:03.748
-You, too.
-Let's do this.

38:10.821 --> 38:11.956
Good luck!

38:12.023 --> 38:14.325
Hello. We're Super Idol. Nice to meet you.

38:15.526 --> 38:16.661
-Good job.
-Good job.

38:18.195 --> 38:19.096
Rian.

38:20.398 --> 38:21.766
You're with them?

38:22.667 --> 38:23.567
Great performance.

38:25.670 --> 38:27.438
My gosh.

38:28.005 --> 38:28.906
Oh, my.

38:29.540 --> 38:30.675
They're really good.

38:33.544 --> 38:35.713
It's incredible how--

38:35.780 --> 38:37.181
Super Idol, you're up next.

38:37.715 --> 38:38.582
Okay.

39:32.069 --> 39:33.471
Here are your rolls.

39:41.278 --> 39:44.382
You always eat so fast,

39:44.648 --> 39:46.016
like someone's chasing you.

39:46.751 --> 39:47.885
It must be a habit.

39:48.919 --> 39:51.389
When I was a trainee,
I didn't want to waste my time eating.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.827
Hold up. Slow down.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.363
Eating too fast is bad for your health.

39:59.964 --> 40:03.300
I'll take your spoon
if you don't slow down.

40:07.705 --> 40:08.539
Feed me.

40:08.906 --> 40:09.740
What?

40:10.141 --> 40:14.311
I can't help but eat fast.
It's bad for my health,

40:15.179 --> 40:17.481
so why don't you feed me?

40:18.883 --> 40:20.184
That way I can eat slowly.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.955
Oh, gosh.

40:25.956 --> 40:28.025
My shoulder hurts so bad
that I can't even lift a spoon.

40:30.127 --> 40:31.195
Hurry up.

40:47.211 --> 40:49.413
I'll end up failing the audition
because of you.

40:50.815 --> 40:53.818
You feed me so well every day.
I'll be out of shape in no time.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.457
Are you really going to
participate in the audition?

41:00.124 --> 41:01.725
You have no time to prepare for it.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.528
I want to get back on stage
as soon as possible,

41:04.595 --> 41:06.497
so that I can let you go.
Isn't that what you want?

41:12.837 --> 41:13.671
But couldn't we

41:14.805 --> 41:15.873
still just eat together

41:17.241 --> 41:19.143
even after my leg is better?

41:22.713 --> 41:24.448
-Well--
-All right. Fine.

41:25.449 --> 41:26.484
I won't talk about it.

41:26.984 --> 41:29.453
I won't say more. Just feed me.

41:30.454 --> 41:32.423
I have to eat a whole lot
to get ready for the audition.

41:33.257 --> 41:34.091
Come on.

41:37.795 --> 41:38.629
Here you go.

42:42.359 --> 42:45.763
PRODUCER SHIN JAE-IN

42:46.730 --> 42:47.565
Hae-seong?

42:47.998 --> 42:49.967
She's a talented songwriter,

42:50.034 --> 42:51.969
so I wrote her a recommendation
to Berklee,

42:53.604 --> 42:54.738
but she says she won't go.

42:55.940 --> 42:57.775
I was wondering
if that had something to do with you.

42:59.343 --> 43:02.880
Just like how you are going to rebuild
your career through the audition,

43:03.581 --> 43:05.549
shouldn't Hae-seong pursue her dream, too?

43:06.517 --> 43:08.085
She gave up her spot
in the audition for you.

43:10.387 --> 43:12.656
Berklee is an amazing opportunity for her.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.126
I'll try to persuade her.

43:45.889 --> 43:46.790
What's the matter?

43:47.358 --> 43:48.926
You look like someone
who's given up on life.

43:50.060 --> 43:51.862
I don't know what to do.

43:52.696 --> 43:56.100
Ui-bong, Hong-ju...
Everyone has become a super idol.

43:56.667 --> 43:58.602
But what have I achieved?

44:00.838 --> 44:04.174
Ui-bong's a good dancer,
and Hong-ju's a good singer.

44:05.542 --> 44:08.345
But you can't sing or dance.

44:08.412 --> 44:10.681
You deserve a good beating.

44:13.083 --> 44:15.486
See? You're full of life,
now that you're mad.

44:16.820 --> 44:17.688
You're right.

44:18.722 --> 44:19.890
I need to lift my spirits.

44:21.425 --> 44:25.262
They say a heartbroken woman
is capable of anything, right?

44:26.163 --> 44:27.631
Is that true?

44:27.831 --> 44:29.266
Of course.

44:29.900 --> 44:34.171
There are many women who have channeled
their anger toward men into power

44:34.238 --> 44:35.539
and become successful.

44:37.608 --> 44:38.575
Do you think...

44:40.177 --> 44:41.745
Hae-seong would be able to do the same?

44:42.880 --> 44:44.515
Are you going to dump her?

44:45.549 --> 44:46.950
"I'm leaving you for your own good."

44:47.584 --> 44:49.353
Don't even think about saying that to her.

44:49.420 --> 44:50.287
You're a jerk.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.922
-I thought you were better than this.
-Hey.

44:51.989 --> 44:53.323
Who said I would dump her?

44:54.358 --> 44:56.226
Why would I do that?

44:57.628 --> 44:59.129
It's more like the other way around.

45:22.086 --> 45:22.920
I'm good, right?

45:23.754 --> 45:24.588
Yes.

45:26.457 --> 45:27.691
My leg's all better now.

45:31.762 --> 45:32.730
Aren't you sad?

45:33.363 --> 45:34.198
Sorry?

45:35.099 --> 45:37.868
We agreed to go our separate ways
once I am recovered.

45:42.072 --> 45:42.906
Right.

45:45.142 --> 45:47.044
If I win this round,
I'll be going on a world tour.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.881
I'll probably be away
until our graduation ceremony.

45:52.483 --> 45:53.317
Right.

45:54.518 --> 45:57.454
I'm sure you'll do great.

45:58.822 --> 46:00.023
You said you wanted to see me

46:01.325 --> 46:02.960
sing and dance on stage, right?

46:04.561 --> 46:05.562
I'll make sure that happens.

46:08.298 --> 46:13.003
This time around,
let's not say that we'll be in touch

46:13.904 --> 46:15.038
or wait for each other.

46:17.441 --> 46:20.544
It would be better for both of us

46:21.612 --> 46:22.746
to let each other go.

46:24.414 --> 46:27.451
Why are you saying this?

46:27.851 --> 46:32.189
If a great chance came your way,
I would gladly send you off.

46:35.359 --> 46:39.563
When I was little, I used to go
and fly a kite with my dad.

46:40.564 --> 46:45.869
We would carefully reel the string
in and out

46:47.571 --> 46:49.173
until the kite got to a certain height.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.009
But when it did,
my dad would cut the string

46:53.443 --> 46:56.547
so that the kite
could fly higher and more freely.

46:59.817 --> 47:00.884
You can do that, too, right?

47:02.386 --> 47:03.554
You can let me go, right?

47:14.498 --> 47:15.332
Here.

47:15.866 --> 47:17.367
This is my last present for you.

47:23.707 --> 47:24.675
You solved it.

47:25.809 --> 47:26.643
Yes.

47:28.512 --> 47:30.214
I played around with it
whenever things got tough

47:31.181 --> 47:32.216
and happened to solve it.

48:11.388 --> 48:12.723
You were right.

48:12.856 --> 48:14.124
She's totally changed.

48:14.191 --> 48:15.025
Right?

48:16.560 --> 48:21.932
Shouldn't you be on a diet
and visiting the spa right about now?

48:23.567 --> 48:26.169
Aren't you supposed to be getting
skin treatment now?

48:27.871 --> 48:31.275
You used to take it easy
for about a month before a TV appearance,

48:31.842 --> 48:33.076
so as not to ruin your figure.

48:33.810 --> 48:36.446
That was when I was the pretty face
of HershE.

48:37.047 --> 48:37.981
So, what are you now?

48:38.048 --> 48:40.984
Call me Riancé. Riancé, got it?

48:43.020 --> 48:44.755
I'll redeem myself so I'll be known

48:45.422 --> 48:46.523
as a teen idol of true talent.

48:49.826 --> 48:51.361
You might come in first place.

48:52.062 --> 48:54.064
I will come in first place.

48:54.865 --> 48:55.699
Okay.

50:00.697 --> 50:03.100
SHIN HAE-SEONG

51:06.930 --> 51:09.499
I want to give you back
your most prized possession.

51:11.835 --> 51:13.336
I told you I didn't need it.

51:17.741 --> 51:20.477
We're friends, right?

51:21.711 --> 51:22.646
Shin Hae-seong.

51:24.247 --> 51:25.282
A star...

51:26.850 --> 51:28.752
is just a star when it's alone,

51:29.319 --> 51:33.290
but when stars come together,
a story comes into being,

51:33.690 --> 51:35.092
and they get a new name.

51:36.293 --> 51:37.360
Like a constellation?

51:38.261 --> 51:39.129
Yes.

51:40.297 --> 51:42.833
You're a big, bright star,

51:43.567 --> 51:46.403
while I'm a tiny, dim speck in the sky.

51:47.471 --> 51:49.639
But wouldn't a great new story develop

51:50.674 --> 51:53.110
if we became friends?

51:56.146 --> 51:57.080
Hae-seong.

51:59.783 --> 52:01.051
You are my friend.

52:03.086 --> 52:04.221
You have to tell me

52:05.322 --> 52:06.723
that new story later, okay?

52:21.838 --> 52:23.507
There's something I wanted to ask you.

52:24.674 --> 52:26.543
Something to ask me?

52:32.149 --> 52:34.284
You seem so plain.

52:35.685 --> 52:36.786
You're not that pretty.

52:40.390 --> 52:41.691
What did JB

52:42.692 --> 52:44.194
see in you?

52:45.729 --> 52:48.999
What did he see in you that I don't have?

52:50.867 --> 52:52.202
I don't know.

52:52.936 --> 52:54.871
There must be something.

52:56.439 --> 52:57.674
Can't you tell me?

53:01.945 --> 53:04.447
Solve this puzzle first,
and then I'll tell you.

53:09.753 --> 53:10.587
What?

53:11.555 --> 53:12.622
It's already put together.

53:14.124 --> 53:17.627
This is what you look like.

53:19.029 --> 53:22.365
You're so perfect and put together

53:23.099 --> 53:24.768
that all people can do
is admire you from afar.

53:25.936 --> 53:28.972
There's nothing
that anyone can do for you.

53:40.050 --> 53:43.687
You don't have to be perfect.
Let others come to you to help you.

53:44.854 --> 53:48.058
When you hit some bumps in the road,
give them a chance to help you.

53:57.300 --> 53:59.970
This is a huge concert hall.

54:00.537 --> 54:02.272
Our kids must have
really hit the big time.

54:02.505 --> 54:03.340
Right.

54:05.108 --> 54:06.610
Why don't you mingle
with those foreigners?

54:06.910 --> 54:08.178
You're an English teacher.

54:09.679 --> 54:12.015
I only know African-American vernacular.

54:15.185 --> 54:16.152
Is that an issue?

54:18.855 --> 54:21.091
Here's the stage.

54:24.694 --> 54:26.062
It's quite fancy.

54:29.966 --> 54:33.003
I don't know why my dad
insists on fancy venues.

54:33.637 --> 54:35.372
Just look at this place.

54:35.939 --> 54:37.107
This is all money.

54:38.041 --> 54:40.543
You're already being mindful
of our finances?

54:41.745 --> 54:43.246
You're so thrifty.

54:43.880 --> 54:46.349
You guys don't earn anything.
I'm worried we'll go into debt.

54:48.251 --> 54:50.120
Don't you trust me?

54:51.054 --> 54:52.222
How can I trust you?

54:54.691 --> 54:55.659
Let's go.

54:56.159 --> 54:57.294
What's wrong?

55:12.375 --> 55:13.243
Let's go.

55:36.633 --> 55:39.469
-You like this, right? Here.
-Right.

55:42.639 --> 55:45.308
Why didn't you invite JB? He loves to eat.

55:45.709 --> 55:47.277
He has to perform today.

55:47.744 --> 55:49.145
He has to get ready for it.

55:49.813 --> 55:51.414
I see.

55:52.048 --> 55:53.850
Is he better now?

55:54.184 --> 55:55.919
Yes. I think so.

55:57.220 --> 55:59.322
-Eat up.
-Hae-seong, just because

55:59.389 --> 56:01.624
you're going abroad doesn't mean
that you can cheat on JB, okay?

56:02.192 --> 56:04.561
The things you say.

56:04.894 --> 56:07.163
Can't I even talk?

56:17.040 --> 56:19.309
-Here.
-Thank you.

56:38.661 --> 56:40.463
TO JB

56:45.902 --> 56:46.770
Let's play.

56:47.470 --> 56:48.671
What about the audition?

56:49.572 --> 56:50.607
What are you doing here?

56:50.907 --> 56:52.375
And what about you?

56:54.210 --> 56:55.078
Mind your own business.

56:59.482 --> 57:00.350
Let's bet.

57:01.551 --> 57:02.385
A free throw bet.

57:02.485 --> 57:03.753
What should we bet this time?

57:06.322 --> 57:08.491
Let Hae-seong go
so that there are no lingering feelings.

57:10.193 --> 57:11.461
She's on her way to the airport.

57:13.229 --> 57:14.164
I know.

57:15.098 --> 57:16.332
If you know that, why are you here?

57:18.101 --> 57:21.638
Being a coward and hiding
isn't a good way to let someone go.

57:23.373 --> 57:25.074
Go to the airport and send her off.

57:28.278 --> 57:29.446
Send her off in style.

57:30.814 --> 57:31.648
What about you?

57:33.149 --> 57:34.417
Why didn't you go to the airport?

57:35.885 --> 57:38.888
A friend isn't the same as a boyfriend.

57:40.123 --> 57:41.124
Why would I go?

57:45.495 --> 57:46.396
Go.

57:47.297 --> 57:48.531
Don't regret this later.

58:06.182 --> 58:07.083
I missed again.

58:09.085 --> 58:11.654
I always miss at the crucial moment.

58:17.026 --> 58:18.328
What are you mumbling?

58:20.864 --> 58:22.932
Yu-jin, you look quite nice.

58:24.467 --> 58:27.570
Does it make you feel better
to pretend to be so cool?

58:28.838 --> 58:30.874
I feel great.

58:31.140 --> 58:31.975
Do you?

58:32.041 --> 58:33.176
I'm in tip-top form.

58:33.977 --> 58:35.745
Do you want to play?

58:36.045 --> 58:37.313
Get out of here.

58:38.081 --> 58:39.549
You're just about to break down and cry.

58:39.816 --> 58:41.784
Who? Me?

58:42.719 --> 58:44.888
When will you start running your own race?

58:47.857 --> 58:48.725
Come on.

58:49.125 --> 58:50.727
Are you going to be a pacemaker
all your life?

58:52.362 --> 58:54.330
If you stay where you are,

58:55.298 --> 58:57.901
you'll never be able to see what's beyond.

59:11.214 --> 59:12.215
We're here today

59:13.082 --> 59:17.520
to pick the single winner
of the Super Idol Audition.

59:18.755 --> 59:22.025
The winner will be able
to release a single

59:22.692 --> 59:25.295
and take part in the EMG World Tour.

59:26.396 --> 59:30.300
As I said earlier,
each contestant will deliver

59:30.366 --> 59:32.235
two performances,
one dance and one singing.

59:39.208 --> 59:40.543
Is everyone ready?

59:41.110 --> 59:41.978
-Yes.
-Yes.

59:42.745 --> 59:43.713
Where's JB?

59:44.681 --> 59:45.815
Yu-jin's not here, either.

59:47.383 --> 59:48.718
Has anyone seen JB or Yu-jin?

1:00:02.532 --> 1:00:06.536
If it gets too tough,
don't hesitate to call home.

1:00:08.838 --> 1:00:10.006
Thank you, Dad.

1:00:11.207 --> 1:00:13.910
I'll become a great songwriter.

1:00:15.745 --> 1:00:17.580
This is something I heard on TV.

1:00:18.848 --> 1:00:22.652
They say the Inuit
don't have a word for "great."

1:00:24.053 --> 1:00:27.824
Whether humans or whales,
they are just what they are.

1:00:29.592 --> 1:00:33.129
There are no great Inuit or great whales.

1:00:35.465 --> 1:00:39.102
So, you don't have to try hard
to become great.

1:00:40.536 --> 1:00:43.573
I'm happy with you just the way you are,

1:00:45.341 --> 1:00:46.943
and I'll always support and root for you

1:00:48.244 --> 1:00:49.545
no matter what you do.

1:00:53.149 --> 1:00:54.017
Dad.

1:00:56.386 --> 1:00:58.621
-Good luck, Hae-seong.
-Thanks.

1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:25.014
Hey.

1:01:25.148 --> 1:01:27.216
We were scared you wouldn't show up.

1:01:27.984 --> 1:01:29.686
You're the front-runner.

1:01:30.620 --> 1:01:33.056
What are you talking about?
We're all front-runners.

1:01:33.690 --> 1:01:37.560
That's right. We won't know
who will win until this is over.

1:01:41.464 --> 1:01:42.331
Where's JB?

1:01:42.832 --> 1:01:43.833
Wasn't he with you?

1:03:23.733 --> 1:03:27.637
When you first said you liked me,
I asked you why, right?

1:03:30.106 --> 1:03:31.641
I think that's just how I am.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:36.312
I get nervous
when there isn't a set answer.

1:03:36.612 --> 1:03:37.446
That's why...

1:03:37.713 --> 1:03:38.548
Here.

1:03:39.215 --> 1:03:40.449
This is my last present for you.

1:03:41.517 --> 1:03:44.754
I was so happy when you gave me
the completed puzzle.

1:03:48.925 --> 1:03:50.393
But then it hit me.

1:03:52.061 --> 1:03:55.998
While you were so busy
looking for the answer,

1:03:56.732 --> 1:03:59.035
I had never even asked myself
any questions.

1:04:00.036 --> 1:04:04.974
So, I plan to ask myself
many questions and find the answers.

1:04:06.075 --> 1:04:07.743
I read this in a book.

1:04:08.911 --> 1:04:10.079
God gives each of us

1:04:10.947 --> 1:04:14.851
a puzzle that has one missing piece
which can never be found.

1:04:16.519 --> 1:04:20.289
But what if that missing piece

1:04:22.158 --> 1:04:23.359
for my puzzle...

1:04:25.962 --> 1:04:27.063
is you?

1:04:38.641 --> 1:04:39.475
Shin Hae-seong!

1:04:56.425 --> 1:04:57.560
Why are you here?

1:04:58.794 --> 1:05:00.396
It's time for the audition.

1:05:00.963 --> 1:05:02.031
Don't worry.

1:05:03.499 --> 1:05:04.934
I'm not here to keep you from leaving.

1:05:09.171 --> 1:05:12.508
I just wanted to tell you
that my leg is okay now.

1:05:15.378 --> 1:05:16.846
You saw me running, right?

1:05:18.581 --> 1:05:21.484
So, you shouldn't worry about me anymore.

1:05:24.086 --> 1:05:27.957
Don't worry about me,
and just focus on yourself.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:33.930
I haven't been worrying about you.

1:05:35.998 --> 1:05:36.899
That's hurtful.

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:39.835
I thought you would worry
at least a little about me.

1:05:43.105 --> 1:05:44.807
If you're not worried, why are you crying?

1:05:46.175 --> 1:05:49.278
I got something in my eye.

1:05:50.980 --> 1:05:52.748
I told you that you don't look pretty
when you cry.

1:05:55.451 --> 1:05:57.219
Don't cry. Stop.

1:06:01.424 --> 1:06:02.925
I'll leave if you keep crying.

1:06:08.464 --> 1:06:09.565
It's not like that.

1:06:12.635 --> 1:06:13.636
I'm not crying.
