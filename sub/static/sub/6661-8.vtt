I KNEW THAT.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.371
I LIKE IT

32:05.224 --> 32:08.057
I'D LIKE TO KISS IT.

32:10.059 --> 32:12.601
I'D LIKE THAT, TOO.

WHAT HAPPENED?

33:01.010 --> 33:04.053
THE COLLARS

33:04.053 --> 33:07.456
I'M HOPING

33:07.456 --> 33:11.360
UNLESS OF COURSE
IT'S THE GHOST OF MAYS.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.722
THEN I GUESS
I'M JUST OUT OF LUCK.

33:13.722 --> 33:16.595
I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

37:43.362 --> 37:44.333
HE WAS MINE.

37:44.333 --> 37:47.866
HE CAME TO ME 20 YEARS AGO
AND SOLD HIS SOUL.

37:47.866 --> 37:48.967
HE WANTED TO BE SUPER COP,

37:48.967 --> 37:54.373
