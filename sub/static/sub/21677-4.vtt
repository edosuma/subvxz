WEBVTT

00:13.042 --> 00:13.583
- Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:15.708 --> 00:17.292
- Hello, lovely to meet you.
- Oh, good to meet you. Kelley.

00:17.292 --> 00:19.208
It's been five months of no
sex.

00:19.208 --> 00:20.625
Trouble. It's just gonna
be trouble for me.

00:20.625 --> 00:21.917
Oh, sh--.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.167
- I think it's wild.

00:26.167 --> 00:28.792
- My girlfriend's name is Ro.
I was never in the closet.

00:28.792 --> 00:30.625
I just kind of went
in the closet for a second,

00:30.625 --> 00:32.792
picked out a new outfit,
and came right back out.

00:32.792 --> 00:35.500
- Just make sure when you're
done with any hose, drain it.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.000
So yeah, these windows,
and then flats.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.167
Just scrub this deck.
- All right.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.708
- I was, like, 14.
- Really?

00:45.708 --> 00:46.875
- You weren't being undermined.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.500
That was f---ing
plain rude, bro.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.000
- No, it wasn't.
- Good job, senior deckhand.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.417
- Hey, hey, hey.
I modeled for Paul Mitchell

00:51.417 --> 00:53.208
for two years almost.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.042
You go into a Paul Mitchell
catalogue still to this day

00:55.042 --> 00:56.417
you'll see me in the long hair.

00:56.417 --> 00:57.917
- Yeah, let's get weird.
- I hear that.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.542
- Cheers.
- Yay.

00:59.542 --> 01:01.083
- Did you just chug that?
- Trevor did.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.917
- Can I get a Bud Light,
and two filthy martinis?

01:03.917 --> 01:05.875
- Just chill the f--- out.
- Oh sh--.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.042
Whoa.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.583
- You're sh--faced.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.083
- I'm sh--faced?

01:29.083 --> 01:31.417
Because I'm telling you
something different?

01:31.417 --> 01:32.958
- You're not
telling me anything.

01:32.958 --> 01:35.083
- Of Ben being a dick
and you being a bitch?

01:51.083 --> 01:54.542
- You need to chill out.

01:54.542 --> 01:55.958
- Sorry, Trevor.

01:55.958 --> 01:58.083
- Ah!

01:58.083 --> 02:00.125
- Oh, my God,
it was such a fun night,

02:00.125 --> 02:01.458
why is he being weird now?

02:09.042 --> 02:12.583
- Trevor is this belligerent
little redneck,

02:12.583 --> 02:14.042
you know, I'm just not into it.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.958
- Shut the f--- up.

02:26.958 --> 02:31.000
- Shut the f--- up, dude.
- Hey, bro, stop.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.958
- Just sit the f--- down, man.
- Yeah, f---ing do it, dude.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.167
- Everyone!
- We're all intoxicated.

02:39.167 --> 02:42.667
They're talking sh--.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.917
- That's crossing the line.

02:49.292 --> 02:51.583
- Guys! Stop!

02:51.583 --> 02:54.000
- We need to stop, we're
walking, I'm serious.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.792
- Nico, Nico.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.667
- Mother----er.

03:07.542 --> 03:08.958
- You're a joke.
- It's nothing.

03:08.958 --> 03:10.875
- You're a joke.
- You're a dick.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.125
- You don't insult people
that have fought for you,

03:12.125 --> 03:13.958
especially my brothers.

03:13.958 --> 03:15.708
Guess what. You're not coming
back on the boat tonight.

03:15.708 --> 03:17.167
- Thank you.

03:17.167 --> 03:18.292
- You can go stay in
a f---ing hotel room.

03:18.292 --> 03:19.958
- I don't give a f---, dude.

03:19.958 --> 03:21.208
You shouldn't have gone in the
military.

03:21.208 --> 03:24.792
- Yeah, you're right, dude.
You--

03:24.792 --> 03:27.500
You're a sh-- yachtie.
Go f--- yourself.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.000
- Right, right!

03:30.000 --> 03:32.208
You're a joke.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.208
- Dude's running his mouth
about my marines.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.833
They're my brothers, man.
- He's an asshole.

03:35.833 --> 03:38.250
He's got nothing
to do with you or your boys.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.500
F--- him.
- Yeah.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.708
- F---ing wanker.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.875
- You haven't seen
my radio, have you?

03:58.875 --> 04:00.708
- No, I'm sorry I haven't.
- Okay.

04:02.833 --> 04:06.000
- I haven't woken up yet.
Oh, f---. I'm still drunk.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.917
- Did you talk to the captain?
- Nope, not yet.

04:08.917 --> 04:10.208
- Yeah?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.917
- Soon I get to have
that fun conversation.

04:11.917 --> 04:14.417
- Good morning.
How are you?

04:14.417 --> 04:15.750
- Good, has anyone seen
my radio?

04:15.750 --> 04:17.458
I seem to have misplaced it.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.958
- Well, you can use
Trevor's radio

04:19.958 --> 04:21.792
'cause he's not on the boat.

04:21.792 --> 04:23.208
- Huh?
- Let me grab your cereal

04:23.208 --> 04:25.542
and then we can chat.

04:25.542 --> 04:27.750
- Trevor was a lot more drunk
than everyone realized.

04:27.750 --> 04:28.917
It reminds me,
'cause I've got, like,

04:28.917 --> 04:30.625
an alcoholic in my family,

04:30.625 --> 04:32.208
and it's exactly
the same sh--,

04:32.208 --> 04:35.375
like, they just keep doing it.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.917
- Nice jammies, Kate.
- Thank you.

04:37.917 --> 04:39.458
- How are you after last night?

04:39.458 --> 04:41.458
- I was pretty pissed off, but I
appreciate you

04:41.458 --> 04:43.583
having my back, you know?
- Hey, always.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.625
- So we have no Trevor
on board, huh?

04:45.625 --> 04:47.792
Where did we lose him at?

04:47.792 --> 04:49.792
- The ride home.
- Wow.

04:49.792 --> 04:53.792
- But I think it's best if
Kelley tells you

04:53.792 --> 04:55.542
how it ended.

04:55.542 --> 04:57.750
- Mm-kay, and we'll handle it.

05:02.667 --> 05:03.667
Kelley, Kelley, Lee.

05:03.667 --> 05:05.333
- Go for Kelley.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.833
- Can I see you
in the wheelhouse, please?

05:06.833 --> 05:08.458
- Yes sir, en route.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.333
Morning, Captain.
- Good morning.

05:13.333 --> 05:16.417
- Another fun night off.
- Want to give me a synopsis?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.833
- He got wasted again.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.833
He was being rude to Ben.

05:20.833 --> 05:24.000
Ben goes "quit annoying me,"
and that just set off a trigger.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
He got in my face,
and on the bus ride

05:26.000 --> 05:28.500
back he was
wanting to fight people.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.792
Yeah, and then he started
talking sh-- about marines

05:30.792 --> 05:32.917
that passed away,
and he hit

05:32.917 --> 05:34.750
a real bad nerve on me,
and so I told him

05:34.750 --> 05:36.667
he wasn't coming back
on the boat last night.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.500
- Okay.

05:38.500 --> 05:43.042
Sometimes in the heat of
the moment people say one thing

05:43.042 --> 05:45.125
and somebody interprets
it totally different.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.500
- Yeah.
- So, I'd like

05:46.500 --> 05:48.958
to hear what
everybody else has to say.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.208
- What's in there?
- Blueberries, bananas,

05:53.208 --> 05:55.792
green powder, macka, which,
like,

05:55.792 --> 05:57.500
keeps your sexy juices flowing.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.042
- Uh-huh, my sexy juices
flow just fine.

05:59.042 --> 06:02.000
- It's like an herb.
Oh, no. I know it, God.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.708
- Hey, Lauren?
- Yeah.

06:03.708 --> 06:06.208
- Go see the Captain.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.375
- Oh, f---, really?

06:07.375 --> 06:10.375
- Yeah.

06:10.375 --> 06:13.625
- Hola, had an eventful evening
last night, huh?

06:13.625 --> 06:14.958
- Yeah.
- Want to just give me

06:14.958 --> 06:18.708
a synopsis of what transpired?

06:18.708 --> 06:22.750
- Trevor had a few more drinks,
and all of us were--

06:22.750 --> 06:25.667
- It all started from him
basically arguing with Ben,

06:25.667 --> 06:27.250
and it was like
a ticking time bomb.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.917
- He drinks too much,

06:28.917 --> 06:31.583
and when he does he
just becomes really mouthy.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.250
- When coming back on the bus

06:33.250 --> 06:35.417
he was just starting to
get really, really aggressive.

06:35.417 --> 06:37.583
- Yeah, he was just being
quite threatening and--

06:37.583 --> 06:39.417
- Really?
- He's a f---ing hothead.

06:39.417 --> 06:43.042
- It wasn't okay, and the girls
were really freaked out.

06:43.042 --> 06:45.333
- Okay, well, I appreciate
your input.

06:45.333 --> 06:46.417
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:46.417 --> 06:49.042
- Yeah.
- I will deal with it...

06:49.042 --> 06:50.417
- Thank you.
- One way or another.

06:50.417 --> 06:51.750
- I hope so.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.125
- I will.
- All right.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.833
- You know, the way
he was talking...

06:58.833 --> 07:00.417
- He was digging himself
a hole, like.

07:00.417 --> 07:02.167
- It was a grave, man.

07:02.167 --> 07:03.792
- Do you think
he should be fired?

07:03.792 --> 07:05.792
- Yeah, because he doesn't
want to learn.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.250
- I think he deserves
one more chance.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.833
- So we should wait till he
actually kills someone?

07:11.458 --> 07:14.000
- Oh, there we go.
- Oh f---. Turn around.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.375
- Yeah.

07:31.208 --> 07:33.042
- Hey, Trevor.

07:33.042 --> 07:35.542
- Morning, Cap.
- How you doing this morning?

07:35.542 --> 07:37.208
- I'm good.
I didn't get much sleep.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.958
- No?
- No, sir.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.375
Look, I know you probably know
what happened last night.

07:41.375 --> 07:42.917
I mean, it was fine
for the entire night

07:42.917 --> 07:44.583
until we got back on that bus

07:44.583 --> 07:48.125
with just the whole them
figuring out I was a hair model.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.333
- What?
- I want to figure this out,

07:53.333 --> 07:54.833
'cause I mean,
I'm a hard worker

07:54.833 --> 07:56.625
but I'm still
in the learning process

07:56.625 --> 07:58.292
and some people
don't get it the same way.

07:58.292 --> 08:00.167
Like, when I say something,
it comes off a bit rash

08:00.167 --> 08:02.917
or short,
and I don't want that to happen.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.958
I think it's
a communication issue honestly,

08:04.958 --> 08:08.167
but I'm coming to you
for guidance.

08:08.167 --> 08:10.583
- I think I know
how to handle this.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.833
Kelley, Kelley, Lee.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.333
- Go for Kelley.
- Yeah, can I get you

08:14.333 --> 08:19.500
to the bridge, please?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.167
The reason I asked Kelley
up here is

08:21.167 --> 08:24.167
because I want him
to hear what I have to say.

08:24.167 --> 08:28.125
I think that once is
an accident, twice is a pattern.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.542
Do I believe in my gut
there'll be a third time?

08:30.542 --> 08:32.208
Without a doubt.

08:32.208 --> 08:34.708
We still have
a long way to go this season,

08:34.708 --> 08:38.875
and I cannot afford to babysit.

08:38.875 --> 08:40.708
I think this isn't
the right place

08:40.708 --> 08:42.792
for you at this point in time.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.625
I'm gonna give you
an opportunity

08:44.625 --> 08:46.375
to pack your stuff

08:46.375 --> 08:48.042
and leave the boat
on good terms.

08:48.042 --> 08:50.125
You can go say
good-bye to the crew,

08:50.125 --> 08:51.833
make apologies if you like.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.875
If you don't, that's fine too.

08:53.875 --> 08:56.833
- That's bullsh--, man,
I'm gonna let you bow out

08:56.833 --> 08:59.000
and apologize to the crew, like,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.333
where is the crew
apologizing to me?

09:01.333 --> 09:03.958
- Sorry it worked out this way,
but I have the whole boat

09:03.958 --> 09:06.042
and the whole season
to think of, okay?

09:06.042 --> 09:07.958
- Yes, sir.

09:07.958 --> 09:09.583
I owe you an apology though.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.333
- Sorry it didn't work out, bud.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.417
You should go back
to being a f---ing hair model.

09:13.417 --> 09:15.417
- Hey man, I apologize.
I'm leaving.

09:15.417 --> 09:16.917
- Are you?

09:16.917 --> 09:20.083
- Yeah, I just got kicked off.
- Oh, dude.

09:20.083 --> 09:23.208
We've all woken up
with really bad feelings,

09:23.208 --> 09:26.833
and sometimes we're forgiven,
sometimes we're not.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.500
But in this profession,

09:28.500 --> 09:31.833
it's pretty tough
to be forgiven twice.

09:31.833 --> 09:35.083
- I just talked to Trevor
and the Captain.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.667
There's three of us now.

09:36.667 --> 09:39.083
He's gone.
- I'm staying out of it.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.500
I don't want to stir
anymore sh--.

09:40.500 --> 09:45.250
Thank you God for sending this
bad energy

09:45.250 --> 09:46.625
out of my life.

09:50.292 --> 09:52.208
- I just need y'all to be easy.

09:52.208 --> 09:54.208
Just let him go.
Let him go on a good note.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.750
- It's tough to leave
and not know

09:59.750 --> 10:02.042
what your
next destination's gonna be.

10:02.042 --> 10:04.792
I don't know who could come
in and replace me.

10:04.792 --> 10:06.125
It's gonna be tough.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.625
Hey, Kate?
- Yes?

10:07.625 --> 10:09.250
- Is that all my laundry
out of there?

10:09.250 --> 10:10.750
- There's some on the counter
over there

10:10.750 --> 10:12.875
if you want to look through it.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.458
We all have to hit rock bottom

10:14.458 --> 10:16.375
before
we make good life changes.

10:16.375 --> 10:19.792
So hopefully this'll be the best
thing that ever happened to him.

10:19.792 --> 10:23.375
You're welcome, Trevor.

10:23.375 --> 10:24.792
- All right, Trev,
take care of yourself.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.417
Good luck to you.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.250
- All right, thanks, Cap.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.000
- I kind of feel like I failed
a little bit.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.917
- Well, yeah, maybe a little,
but you're still learning.

10:38.917 --> 10:41.667
- I think it'll be smoother
without him.

10:41.667 --> 10:44.125
- Better be.
- That's done and over with.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.250
- One guest doesn't eat meat,

10:47.250 --> 10:48.792
gluten-free, dairy-free,
wheat-free,

10:48.792 --> 10:50.458
and then they wanted
a formal dinner

10:50.458 --> 10:53.125
on the first night
with 12-course tasting menu.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.750
- Sh--.

11:05.167 --> 11:07.500
- I think us three as
a team is powerful, so...

11:07.500 --> 11:09.000
- Exactly. I'm not worried about
us anyway. We'll be great.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.292
- I don't need to think
about it twice.

11:10.292 --> 11:11.500
- We got a strong trio.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.792
- Maybe a little more physically
tired,

11:12.792 --> 11:14.042
but we'll be good.

11:14.042 --> 11:15.875
- Yeah.
- Did he say anything to y'all?

11:15.875 --> 11:17.042
- He didn't say a word.
Didn't look at me, didn't...

11:17.042 --> 11:18.833
- Nada.

11:18.833 --> 11:21.458
- And I don't know if
that's him being embarrassed or

11:21.458 --> 11:23.542
if that's just him being a dick.

11:23.542 --> 11:25.208
- Yeah.
- F--- you, Trevor.

11:25.208 --> 11:26.625
I'm moving to the top bunk.

11:26.625 --> 11:29.167
- Moving back to top
bunk, mother----er.

11:30.458 --> 11:32.208
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, hon.

11:32.208 --> 11:33.708
- So Trevor is gone.

11:33.708 --> 11:35.708
- Yeah, I didn't get a chance
to say bye.

11:35.708 --> 11:38.458
- I hate to see him go,
but it just wasn't a good fit.

11:38.458 --> 11:39.792
Trevor never did anything to me.

11:39.792 --> 11:41.542
He was always friendly, like,

11:41.542 --> 11:44.125
there was a lot of negative
energy on the boat

11:44.125 --> 11:46.542
and I could tell that
he was having a hard time.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.042
- Trevor just got off
on the wrong foot,

11:48.042 --> 11:50.667
and he carried on that path.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.667
- I'm tired today.
- Nice night.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.417
It was fun though apart
from everything else.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.208
- The swings were legendary.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.917
- How fun are they?
No, these are on the swings.

12:00.917 --> 12:02.708
- Yeah, you're like, "Have you
seen the other swings?"

12:02.708 --> 12:05.042
And I was like,
"Where is she taking me?"

12:05.042 --> 12:07.708
Emily's hot, she's cool.

12:07.708 --> 12:10.333
Oh, f---. I'm gonna get in
trouble, I know it.

12:10.333 --> 12:11.708
I don't care.

12:11.708 --> 12:14.375
It was awesome.

12:14.375 --> 12:18.000
- Never underestimate.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.417
- Kate, Ben, and Kelley,

12:19.417 --> 12:21.583
I need you guys
in the crew mess immediately.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.333
We need a preference
sheet meeting.

12:23.333 --> 12:27.417
- Yeah.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.833
- So this is
a group of entrepreneurs

12:29.833 --> 12:31.708
that have met and developed

12:31.708 --> 12:34.375
a strong friendship through
their internet companies.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.542
We have John Chow
and the co-primary

12:36.542 --> 12:38.125
Jeremy Schoemaker.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.792
We have John's daughter, Ashley,

12:39.792 --> 12:43.125
we have some interesting
aspects to this charter.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.042
They want to do
a lot of exploring,

12:45.042 --> 12:46.792
and a beach bar.

12:46.792 --> 12:50.875
Do you see any issues with being
a man down on this thing?

12:50.875 --> 12:52.958
- No, we'll make it.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.917
- And I'll get somebody as soon
as I can

12:54.917 --> 12:56.458
to help us out,
all right?

12:56.458 --> 13:00.625
So one guest likes
absolutely nothing.

13:00.625 --> 13:03.208
She doesn't eat meat, chicken,
or pork.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.750
She doesn't eat seafood,
except fish.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.042
- So she eats fish.
- And she's gluten-free,

13:08.042 --> 13:09.417
dairy-free, wheat-free,

13:09.417 --> 13:12.917
and water has to be
pH above 7.5.

13:14.792 --> 13:17.292
- Sh--.
- And then they want

13:17.292 --> 13:19.000
to do a formal dinner
on the first night

13:19.000 --> 13:20.750
with 12-course tasting menu.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.167
- Whoa.
- Wow.

13:22.167 --> 13:25.333
- Whoa.
- 12 courses is, like, insane.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.083
We should be starting at
3:00 p.m.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.833
12 courses is crazy.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.667
- So what are your concerns,
Benjamin?

13:30.667 --> 13:33.125
Besides everything?
- Ben is stressed.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.125
- F---.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.333
F--- it.
- Okay.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.250
Trevor was
a quintessential idiot.

13:44.250 --> 13:48.458
The guy wears his baseball
cap backwards with sunglasses.

13:49.833 --> 13:51.667
- Another charter, man.
- Another one.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.333
- I'm already looking
forward for them to leave.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.833
We should just do, like,
a pre-thing, like,

13:54.833 --> 13:56.125
where they get on and they just
hand us

13:56.125 --> 13:57.458
the envelope to begin with.

13:57.458 --> 13:58.917
It's, like,
just give me your money.

13:58.917 --> 14:00.958
- Mm-hmm, let's look at these
bad boys, huh?

14:00.958 --> 14:02.792
- They look intimidating though,
don't they?

14:02.792 --> 14:05.375
- They want all the water
toys, sea bobs,

14:05.375 --> 14:07.708
water skiing, inflatable toys.

14:07.708 --> 14:09.333
- You guys are going to have
a lot on your plate.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.792
- Especially 'cause there's
three of us now.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.833
The inflatable pool,
for example, that,

14:12.833 --> 14:15.542
like, takes four
if not five people.

14:15.542 --> 14:16.708
- Yeah.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.667
- We're such an effective team.

14:20.875 --> 14:23.208
But we'll have him
out of our mind.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.875
- That's what I'm saying is,
I might pick up,

14:24.875 --> 14:26.708
like, an extra hobby,
maybe play guitar or something.

14:26.708 --> 14:29.333
There's gonna be so much
extra time we're gonna have.

14:29.333 --> 14:30.667
- I will leave that there
for other people to read.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.000
- I'm going to bed.
- All right.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.875
- Night-night.
- Night, hon.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.833
I'll see you in the morning.
- Catch you in the morning.

14:40.458 --> 14:43.500
- Babe, I can't hear you.

14:47.042 --> 14:48.833
Open it. I want to Skype.
Open it.

14:48.833 --> 14:51.250
F---, I hate you.
Open it.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.250
I've always
just left land life behind,

14:53.250 --> 14:54.750
but now that I have someone

14:54.750 --> 14:56.333
I want to talk to
on a regular basis,

14:56.333 --> 14:58.042
this Wi-Fi's really become
an issue.

14:58.042 --> 15:01.417
I've been trying to get in touch
with you for two hours.

15:01.417 --> 15:04.042
I mean, getting a wire coat
hanger wrapped in foil

15:04.042 --> 15:06.375
and standing on the radar
might be a better idea...

15:06.375 --> 15:09.542
I am so tired.
- You look great.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.667
- Than trying to connect
to "Valor" Wi-Fi.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.917
- Oh, baby, what you want to
do?

15:14.917 --> 15:17.167
I know what I want to do.
- Oh, you're funny.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.500
- What are you doing?
You...

15:18.500 --> 15:22.083
- Oh, sh--.
Babe, hello?

15:22.083 --> 15:24.542
F---.

15:33.792 --> 15:35.708
- Hey, Babe, good morning.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.792
- 12-course
tasting menu tonight.

15:37.792 --> 15:39.375
- Ben is gonna lose his mind.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.542
One of the guests
is gluten-free,

15:40.542 --> 15:42.625
some kind of vegan hippy crap.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.625
- That's how I prefer to eat.
- Yeah?

15:44.625 --> 15:46.458
- Yeah, I just always
like healthier stuff.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.792
Like, I started juicing,
and it became a business.

15:48.792 --> 15:50.792
- Wow.
- But it was really hard,

15:50.792 --> 15:53.625
because I was really broke,
and I found out about yachting,

15:53.625 --> 15:55.958
and I was like, "Okay,
this is what I'm gonna do."

15:55.958 --> 15:57.375
I want to make a ton of money

15:57.375 --> 15:59.625
and return
to the industry of juice.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.792
Like, it's what I'm really
passionate about.

16:01.792 --> 16:06.083
It's changed my life,
and I want to change others.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.792
- Well, you should make juice
for the crew.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.333
- I would love to.
- Yeah.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.167
- The trinamic trio.

16:12.167 --> 16:14.500
- The trinamic?
- The terrific trio.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.667
- F---ing effective deck team
we are.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.917
- Yeah.

16:18.917 --> 16:20.833
- I need gluten-free f---ing
everything.

16:20.833 --> 16:23.667
- If you need any help,
like, I used to do catering.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.667
For her,
we could do fresh rolls

16:25.667 --> 16:28.417
and get some avocado,
mint, veggies inside.

16:28.417 --> 16:30.000
- Great idea.
- Like, a roasted beet

16:30.000 --> 16:32.083
and goat cheese salad.

16:32.083 --> 16:35.667
Or some fruit, maybe a cream,
that would be so good.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.000
- Sierra and Carolina are

16:37.000 --> 16:39.833
a match made
in gluten-free heaven,

16:39.833 --> 16:42.458
which for most people
is actually hell.

16:42.458 --> 16:44.167
You should be her personal chef.

16:44.167 --> 16:46.458
- Okay.
- Stop it.

16:46.458 --> 16:49.208
- Attention all crew, we got
provisions out on the dock.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.792
I need some people up here.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.208
- Oh, it is
a bit windy today.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.458
- He's gonna have a hell of
a time getting off the dock.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.333
All right, their charter
a man down sucks,

17:06.333 --> 17:09.208
but it's us three
doing the work anyways.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.792
Watch schedule, I'm 7:00 a.m.
to 10:00 p.m.,

17:11.792 --> 17:13.167
Lauren, you're in the kitchen
till 11:00.

17:13.167 --> 17:14.708
- Okay.
- Nico, you're 9:00 to whenever

17:14.708 --> 17:16.042
the guests go down.

17:16.042 --> 17:17.625
I'm gonna be up
on bow for lines.

17:17.625 --> 17:19.042
y'all are gonna stay
where y'all are.

17:19.042 --> 17:20.708
You're gonna be draining
the hot tub.

17:20.708 --> 17:21.958
So before we pull out of port,
you've got to run up there

17:21.958 --> 17:23.625
and drain it.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.625
- Okay, so are we still doing
the pool this charter?

17:24.625 --> 17:26.042
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

17:26.042 --> 17:27.667
- All right, you guys,
y'all ready?

17:27.667 --> 17:28.875
- Yeah, I think it's gonna be
a good charter.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.833
- Hell, yeah.

17:38.417 --> 17:39.917
- Oh, please work.

17:39.917 --> 17:41.542
Don't do this.

17:43.417 --> 17:45.250
- Sh--.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.000
It's not working.
- Do you need help?

17:47.000 --> 17:52.042
- If you can make this work
for me, that would be good.

17:52.042 --> 17:56.042
Sorry, Sierra, but you're dumb
as a box of rocks.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.083
- You got it to work?
You're the best.

17:58.083 --> 18:01.250
- No problem.
Uh-uh, you got to use this.

18:01.250 --> 18:05.167
- Thank you.
- No problem.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.125
- Okay, I need all
the crew out here, now.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.750
Guests are on their way, and
they're walking down the dock.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.458
Let's go.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.125
- That is a beauty.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.125
- I can't wait to get
on that puppy.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.792
- Of course the wind comes
right back up.

18:25.792 --> 18:28.125
- So great having
the most top-heavy drinks.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.625
- F---.

18:31.625 --> 18:34.875
- ♪ Time to make that money ♪

18:34.875 --> 18:36.542
Oh, f---.
Sh--.

18:40.958 --> 18:41.208
- They're here.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.458
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:43.458 --> 18:44.708
- Welcome aboard "Valor."
Captain Lee.

18:44.708 --> 18:45.875
- John Chow, pleasure
to meet you.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.042
- My pleasure.
- Welcome.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.042
- Thank you very much.
- Hello.

18:48.042 --> 18:49.625
- Hello.
- Welcome.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.292
- Hello, lovely to meet you.
- Cheers, guys.

18:51.292 --> 18:53.000
Cheers.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.583
- Welcome aboard "Valor,"
everybody.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.500
We've got a great few days
planned for you.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.167
Kate will give you
a tour of the boat

18:58.167 --> 18:59.833
and I'd like to get off the dock

18:59.833 --> 19:01.292
so we can get
your party started.

19:01.292 --> 19:03.000
- Awesome, sounds good,
thank you.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.167
- Right this way, guys.

19:04.167 --> 19:05.917
So this is the main salon.

19:05.917 --> 19:08.167
- Oh, wow beautiful.
- The boat was just refitted,

19:08.167 --> 19:10.250
so this is all brand-new.
- Wow.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.333
- So now we're going
onto the master suite.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.083
- Yay.
- Yeah, you love?

19:14.083 --> 19:16.125
- My room.
- It's awesome.

19:16.125 --> 19:19.333
- Oh, my God.
Heavy, huh?

19:19.333 --> 19:22.292
- Watch out,
watch out, watch out.

19:22.292 --> 19:23.833
Jesus.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.333
- We've got two mirror-image
rooms.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.625
that are exactly the same,
and then this room

19:26.625 --> 19:28.833
with the two twin beds.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.833
And then we'll continue down the
hallway, and I'll show y'all...

19:31.833 --> 19:34.625
- I am getting a strange vibe
from these people.

19:34.625 --> 19:39.042
Mr. Chow, Gene the Russian,
the creepy white-haired guy

19:39.042 --> 19:40.708
that wants to kill you
with his eyeballs.

19:40.708 --> 19:43.708
This feels like D-list
Quentin Tarantino characters.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.208
- Male bonding right there.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.042
- This room's got
our name on it.

19:47.042 --> 19:49.542
- Okay, let's get all
our deckhands in position

19:49.542 --> 19:51.167
so we can get out
of here, please.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.542
- Copy that, standing by.

19:52.542 --> 19:54.458
- And we're gonna go up
to the sun deck.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.375
So we've got a nice,
large Jacuzzi.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.208
- There's the Jacuzzi.
- Let's get naked.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.375
- Deckhands are ready
when you are.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.875
- Copy that.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.208
- Get that floating fender
on that corner!

20:04.208 --> 20:06.000
- That wind's kicking off, man.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.792
- I've got two fenders
on the stern.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.208
- Why don't you run back and
single up

20:09.208 --> 20:11.208
that stern line as well.

20:11.208 --> 20:14.042
- Okay, what flag is that?
Is that a country I should know?

20:14.042 --> 20:16.167
- You really are geographically
challenged, aren't you?

20:16.167 --> 20:17.417
- Oh, very, very much so.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.250
- Stern line's clear, Captain.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.583
- All lines are clear.
- Roger that, we're coming off.

20:21.583 --> 20:23.708
- F---, they're just,
like, bouncing off.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.417
- Yeah, I don't think we're
gonna be able to get off this.

20:25.417 --> 20:27.917
- This boat is
a little under-powered

20:27.917 --> 20:29.583
with the wind blowing against
it,

20:29.583 --> 20:31.708
and you're trying
to go the other direction

20:31.708 --> 20:33.917
and then the tide's trying to
take you in a third direction.

20:33.917 --> 20:35.917
F---, come on.

20:35.917 --> 20:38.375
- We got a break in this gust.
- I'm cranking the thrusters.

20:38.375 --> 20:39.583
She's coming out.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.917
- Yes.
- Okay, let's do this.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.917
- Whoo, nice job.

20:45.917 --> 20:47.417
We killed it.

20:47.417 --> 20:48.917
It's nice out once you're
moving.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.042
- Look at that small boat.

20:53.042 --> 20:54.708
- 5 percenters.

20:54.708 --> 20:56.208
- How can you live?

20:56.208 --> 20:58.125
Do you want to borrow some
money?

21:00.125 --> 21:01.792
- Okay, give me three shots.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.542
- Roger.
Okay, here we go.

21:06.792 --> 21:08.875
That's three shots.
- Lock it in.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.375
- What time is it in New York
right now?

21:10.375 --> 21:12.042
- You have a business call?
- Yeah, I do.

21:12.042 --> 21:13.292
- We're on vacation.
- I'm never on vacation.

21:13.292 --> 21:15.125
- Always on vacation.

21:15.125 --> 21:16.792
That's the great thing
about doing it autopilot.

21:16.792 --> 21:18.375
It's just making the money
while I'm sitting here.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.125
- We're making more money
right now

21:20.125 --> 21:21.792
than most people make in a year.
- And we're on a boat.

21:21.792 --> 21:23.125
- How do you guys think
2:00 for lunch sounds?

21:23.125 --> 21:24.458
- Good.
- Is that good?

21:24.458 --> 21:26.792
- Perfect.

21:26.792 --> 21:28.042
- Hey, Kelley, I'm just gonna
straighten up

21:28.042 --> 21:29.583
the bridge deck aft.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.083
- Roger that.
Thank you, Nico.

21:36.292 --> 21:37.625
- Hi, Ben.

21:37.625 --> 21:39.417
- Hello.
- 2:00 works.

21:39.417 --> 21:41.250
- Brilliant, thank you.
- What do you want to make?

21:41.250 --> 21:43.250
- I'm doing duck breast,
some seared tuna.

21:43.250 --> 21:45.083
- Okay.

21:45.083 --> 21:47.583
- Right now, I just want
to give the guests lunch,

21:47.583 --> 21:49.750
because I need a good amount
of time

21:49.750 --> 21:52.333
to prepare for this
12-course dinner.

21:52.333 --> 21:55.333
- That looks good, spicy.
- We do have one girl.

21:55.333 --> 21:57.625
- Yeah, your best friend?
- Yeah, my best buddy.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.792
- Yeah.
- She doesn't like spicy.

21:59.792 --> 22:02.250
- It's not that spicy.
- So are they in the water?

22:02.250 --> 22:04.750
Or what are they doing, baby?

22:04.750 --> 22:05.958
Oh.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.417
- I hope you were
talking to Kate.

22:07.417 --> 22:09.000
I--I was.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.958
- You guys want to have a seat?
We can start bringing out lunch.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.333
- Oh, thank you.
- You're so adorable.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.958
Emily, if something
should happen to my wife...

22:31.208 --> 22:33.375
- Is that what he said?

22:33.375 --> 22:35.500
- And then...

22:35.500 --> 22:37.542
- If my wife dies?

22:37.542 --> 22:42.042
Jesus, she's probably
gonna commit suicide.

22:42.042 --> 22:43.625
- ♪ It's charter time ♪

22:47.500 --> 22:48.708
- Nothing.

22:48.708 --> 22:50.625
- Would you like
some conch salad?

22:50.625 --> 22:52.708
- What's in that salad?
- Conch.

22:52.708 --> 22:54.458
- What's conch?
- It's a fish.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.958
- I love the beet salad.

22:58.958 --> 23:01.500
- ♪ Time to make that money ♪

23:01.500 --> 23:03.583
♪ Make that money ♪

23:03.583 --> 23:06.667
F---.

23:08.375 --> 23:11.417
Sh--.

23:11.417 --> 23:14.042
Oh, sh--.

23:14.042 --> 23:16.500
F---, f---.

23:23.250 --> 23:24.833
- It seems like
a very diverse group.

23:24.833 --> 23:26.333
Diverse preferences.

23:26.333 --> 23:27.833
- I know, we'll have
to deal with that.

23:27.833 --> 23:30.917
- You want some lemonade?

23:30.917 --> 23:34.417
It's so good.

23:34.417 --> 23:36.042
- F---ing hell.
- What?

23:36.042 --> 23:38.042
- It's sweet, very sweet.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.000
Sierra's lemonade is awful.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.083
I hope her culinary skills are
better than her juicing skills.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.458
- I like it, whatever.
- Yeah, Kelley,

23:47.458 --> 23:49.792
whenever you have a moment
will you come to the sun deck?

23:49.792 --> 23:52.292
- Yeah, coming to the sun deck.
- So good.

23:52.292 --> 23:53.750
- Would you like some tuna?

23:53.750 --> 23:55.375
- I would, and could I
get more quinoa?

23:55.375 --> 23:56.917
- Of course.

23:56.917 --> 23:58.958
- Holy, hey,
was it raining again?

23:58.958 --> 24:00.625
- No, it's not raining,
it over-filled.

24:00.625 --> 24:03.208
I thought it stops.
- No.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.958
- Yeah, man,
that's totally my bad.

24:04.958 --> 24:06.292
I'm draining it now.
- All right.

24:06.292 --> 24:07.625
I'm gonna grab
a shammy and help.

24:07.625 --> 24:10.750
- Yeah, thanks.
F---ing hot tub.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.583
F---ing Jacuzzi,
are you serious?

24:12.583 --> 24:15.625
Like, really?
F---ing Jacuzzi.

24:15.625 --> 24:17.625
- It happened
at the best time it could,

24:17.625 --> 24:19.208
'cause they're down
there eating,

24:19.208 --> 24:20.792
so nobody's gonna be up here
for a minute.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.375
Everything will be dry.
It'll all be good.

24:22.375 --> 24:23.958
- Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, I should've checked it.

24:23.958 --> 24:25.625
- It's no big deal.
Don't beat yourself up.

24:34.167 --> 24:35.750
- He likes food.
- Who? Chow?

24:35.750 --> 24:37.792
- Yeah, I'm looking at,
like, his Instagram.

24:37.792 --> 24:40.500
He loves food.
There's so many food photos.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.625
- I wish it was just him.
- Yeah.

24:42.625 --> 24:45.000
- But I can have Sierra
from now on, right, baby?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.667
- She's gonna come talk to you
about meal plan and everything?

24:47.667 --> 24:49.000
- Yeah, of course.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.500
- You gonna go swimming?
I think that we--

24:50.500 --> 24:52.000
- I'm always ready
to go swimming.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.667
- Where is--can we go
to the Jacuzzi?

24:53.667 --> 24:55.750
- Kelley, Kelley, Lee,
break out every toy we got.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.958
I want the pool--
all the sea bobs.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.833
If it floats, I want it
behind the boat, okay?

24:59.833 --> 25:01.667
- Roger that.
- Right now.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.625
I believe that Kelley
has the skill

25:04.625 --> 25:06.417
to manage the team
being a man down,

25:06.417 --> 25:08.292
but only time will tell.

25:08.292 --> 25:10.792
- Ready? One, two, three.

25:10.792 --> 25:13.125
- It's heavy as f---.

25:13.125 --> 25:15.375
- Ready and one, two, three.

25:15.375 --> 25:17.208
- All right, hold on,
push this way a bit more.

25:17.208 --> 25:20.458
- Yeah, ready one, two, three.

25:24.042 --> 25:26.125
- Oh, f---. Damn it, man.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.125
- You all right?
- Let's do this.

25:29.125 --> 25:31.542
- Like, augh, there's so much
stuff

25:31.542 --> 25:32.708
we need to bring out.

25:32.708 --> 25:34.500
That needs to come.
We need to f---.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.458
So with a man down, it's,
like....

25:37.458 --> 25:38.542
Oh, sh--.

25:38.542 --> 25:41.667
Well done, Lauren.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.292
- I've seen horses
that have manes

25:43.292 --> 25:47.167
that had shorter hair
than this guy on his back.

25:47.167 --> 25:49.708
- Can I stand on this?
- Just carefully.

25:49.708 --> 25:53.167
It's a bit slippy, but it's
hard, so you'll be okay.

25:53.167 --> 25:55.250
- All right.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.708
I don't think people actually
appreciate how difficult it is

25:57.708 --> 26:00.583
to do a 12-course
tasting menu

26:00.583 --> 26:02.792
in a tiny kitchen on a boat.

26:04.208 --> 26:05.917
- So, Ben?
- Yes.

26:05.917 --> 26:08.417
- I have not done
a 12-course service before.

26:08.417 --> 26:09.708
What should I expect?

26:09.708 --> 26:11.083
- Chaos.

26:11.083 --> 26:12.542
- You might cry.

26:15.583 --> 26:18.542
- Whoa.

26:22.917 --> 26:25.000
- Nico, pick up
this bob, please.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.333
- We're running around
everywhere like chickens

26:26.333 --> 26:27.750
with our heads cut off.

26:27.750 --> 26:30.458
I am completely
exhausted right now.

26:33.208 --> 26:34.792
- Yeah!

26:34.792 --> 26:37.292
- Right here, conch, scallop,
foie gras.

26:37.292 --> 26:39.208
She's excluded
from all three of them,

26:39.208 --> 26:41.625
so why not just give her
a really nice salad

26:41.625 --> 26:43.625
with every f---ing
vegetable I have.

26:43.625 --> 26:44.792
- Okay.
- All right?

26:44.792 --> 26:46.583
That way she'll be tide over.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.958
The game plan for Carolina
is to give her food

26:48.958 --> 26:50.625
that she can eat

26:50.625 --> 26:52.958
while the others
are eating courses

26:52.958 --> 26:54.750
that she won't eat.

26:54.750 --> 26:57.625
So I'm hoping Sierra
will be able to lift

26:57.625 --> 27:00.792
that burden and deal
with Carolina tonight.

27:00.792 --> 27:02.208
Yeah, I think a nice
sautéed bit of tuna

27:02.208 --> 27:03.375
or something like that.

27:03.375 --> 27:06.417
- Yeah, she likes the fish.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.125
- All right,
so let's write that down.

27:08.125 --> 27:10.792
Sorry, I'm a little freaked out.
- Yeah.

27:10.792 --> 27:13.792
Part of me is afraid that
sending Sierra in to help Ben

27:13.792 --> 27:15.250
is like sending
a cute little innocent bunny

27:15.250 --> 27:16.833
into a rabid lion's den,

27:16.833 --> 27:19.000
but the bunny's
helping the rabid lion,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.333
so I hope the rabid
lion can keep it in check.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.292
- Just hold on.
- So she can have scallop?

27:23.292 --> 27:25.417
- She can't have scallop,
she doesn't eat shellfish.

27:25.417 --> 27:27.500
- Oh, sashimi?

27:27.500 --> 27:30.125
- No, 'cause conch's in a shell.
- Oh, okay.

27:30.125 --> 27:32.083
So is the scallop.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.667
Okay, just if I were you,
I'd just take--just f---ing

27:34.667 --> 27:35.917
get some veggies up here.

27:35.917 --> 27:37.000
- Okay.
- Cool.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.333
- Whatever.

27:39.333 --> 27:41.083
- All right, hold on.
- Ooh, I'm so sorry.

27:41.083 --> 27:43.000
- Yeah, I can see
you're a little rattled.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.833
- What's going on?
- That tuna's f---ed.

27:44.833 --> 27:46.333
I don't want
to serve it anymore.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.583
- Can't deal with this.
So f---ed up.

27:53.000 --> 27:53.833
- What list are you writing?

27:53.500 --> 27:53.833
- What I'm making.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.000
We're substituting two
of the courses

27:58.000 --> 28:01.708
for the woman with a lot
of dietary restrictions.

28:01.708 --> 28:03.708
Things are just getting, like,
lost in translation.

28:03.708 --> 28:05.958
It's very important for me
to make a good impression

28:05.958 --> 28:08.792
on Ben with the guests,
so this is kind of a test.

28:08.792 --> 28:10.333
- Hello, ladies.

28:10.333 --> 28:13.042
So are you both
gonna be in the galley then?

28:13.042 --> 28:14.375
The dynamic duo?

28:16.167 --> 28:18.708
- Have they asked
what time's dinner?

28:18.708 --> 28:21.042
8:30, 9:00?

28:21.042 --> 28:24.625
- Okay, thank you.
- Ow, f---.

28:24.625 --> 28:26.375
Dinner is 8:30, 9:00-ish.

28:26.375 --> 28:27.708
Closer to 8:30 would be good.

28:27.708 --> 28:29.042
- Yeah? Okay.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.667
- All right, here we go.

28:41.583 --> 28:45.083
Hey, baby.

28:45.083 --> 28:48.333
- Yes, under the fridge,
you'll find muffin trays please.

28:48.333 --> 28:51.417
Spray the hell
out of that muffin.

28:51.417 --> 28:54.750
A 12-course tasting menu
is a ton of work.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.583
It's just very overwhelming,

28:56.583 --> 28:58.750
and I'm just trying
to get my head round it.

28:58.750 --> 29:01.750
Can you just pull out
some all-purpose flour, please?

29:01.750 --> 29:03.667
No, that's gluten-free.
- Oh, sorry.

29:03.667 --> 29:07.583
So I need someone who actually
can distinguish clear thoughts

29:07.583 --> 29:09.250
in a very small amount of time.

29:09.250 --> 29:11.583
We need to pass this
through the strainer,

29:11.583 --> 29:14.875
the big spoon--here,
these are quite good for that.

29:17.375 --> 29:19.792
Augh, okay, so the garlic will
go through.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.083
It's soft enough.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.583
- Sorry.
- Right, let's pull out

29:22.583 --> 29:24.292
eight shot glasses and just line
them up

29:24.292 --> 29:26.125
in the freezer nicely
so they don't fall.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.458
No, no, no, babe, babe, babe,
they've all got to be the same.

29:28.458 --> 29:29.792
- Sorry.
- My stress level's

29:29.792 --> 29:31.458
a little high
in here tonight, baby.

29:31.458 --> 29:33.292
- Okay, I'm trying to give you
some Zen.

29:33.292 --> 29:36.333
- I like that.
That's why you're here, baby.

29:40.292 --> 29:41.875
- Okay, let's go.

29:45.125 --> 29:47.208
- Hello.
- Oh, wow.

29:47.208 --> 29:50.792
- Whoo.
- Saving the best for last.

29:50.792 --> 29:53.583
- Ben, all the guests
are seated and ready.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.458
Yeah, and I can take
the gazpacho right here.

29:55.458 --> 29:58.125
- All righty, baby,
let's bring it on.

29:58.125 --> 30:01.167
- Every meal with Ben
should be 12 courses,

30:01.167 --> 30:03.500
because then he'd
always be on time.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.958
- Very smart.

30:04.958 --> 30:06.417
- Thank you, yeah.

30:06.417 --> 30:08.458
All right, here we go.

30:09.958 --> 30:12.583
- What kind of gazpacho?
- Beetroot and ginger.

30:12.583 --> 30:14.417
- Okay.

30:14.417 --> 30:17.000
For our first course, we have
beetroot and ginger gazpacho.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.667
- Cheers everybody.
- Here we go, cheers, cheers.

30:21.667 --> 30:24.417
- Oh, yeah.
- That was good.

30:24.417 --> 30:29.625
- If you had the option
of making it the Love Boat,

30:29.625 --> 30:30.958
who would you love?

30:30.958 --> 30:32.167
- Emily, all day.

30:32.167 --> 30:33.583
- Emily huh?
- Emily, yeah.

30:33.583 --> 30:35.167
What about you?

30:35.167 --> 30:38.833
- Yeah, probably Emily.
- Similar tastes.

30:38.833 --> 30:41.042
Sierra, what do you think?

30:41.042 --> 30:42.708
She just seems
a little cray-cray.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.292
- Yeah, man.

30:44.292 --> 30:45.625
- Something's just
a little off with her.

30:45.625 --> 30:47.333
- She has the eyes of
a crazy woman.

30:47.333 --> 30:48.875
I mean, she's very pretty.

30:48.875 --> 30:51.042
But she smiles kind of crazily.

30:56.375 --> 30:58.208
- Seared foie gras.
- Seared foie gras.

30:58.208 --> 30:59.625
- Strawberry jam.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.292
Sierra, how are you, baby?

31:01.292 --> 31:04.667
- Good, I just have
to put the salad together.

31:04.667 --> 31:06.292
- Wait, hold on.
I don't--I mean...

31:06.292 --> 31:08.375
What have you been doing
this whole f---ing time?

31:08.375 --> 31:10.458
- I'll be done in five seconds.
- Amazing.

31:10.458 --> 31:13.708
- Yeah, thank you.
- This is incredible.

31:13.708 --> 31:15.708
- Seared foie gras
with strawberry jam.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.125
- Oh, I love that.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.542
- Yeah, we have a salad
for you coming out next.

31:19.542 --> 31:21.333
- Oh.

31:21.333 --> 31:24.833
- Mmm, I love foie gras.

31:24.833 --> 31:26.333
- Do they like it?
- They seem very happy,

31:26.333 --> 31:27.750
but they're finished.

31:27.750 --> 31:30.042
Ben, do you want to toss
and vinaigrette?

31:30.042 --> 31:31.708
- What is it, hon?
- The salad?

31:31.708 --> 31:34.375
- Do I want to what?
- Toss it before it goes out?

31:34.375 --> 31:36.250
- Your baby, all right?

31:36.250 --> 31:38.083
- Sure.

31:38.083 --> 31:39.667
I'm pretty thick-skinned,
but at the same time,

31:39.667 --> 31:42.083
like, I need to have
positivity around me.

31:42.083 --> 31:45.250
- Maybe we'll have, like,
50 people and 50 girls.

31:45.250 --> 31:47.083
We can have 100 girls

31:47.083 --> 31:49.542
just taking care of everybody
in every way possible.

31:49.542 --> 31:51.042
- Yes, of course.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.500
- John Chow's daughter's at the
table.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.083
This is just gross.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.417
- I have venues.

31:55.417 --> 31:57.750
I'll set it up.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.042
- Thank you, girls.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.917
- This course is
a lemon ginger truffle

32:01.917 --> 32:04.375
caviar sashimi of scallops.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.958
- Ooh, caviar.

32:05.958 --> 32:08.250
- These are very good.
Never had them raw.

32:08.250 --> 32:09.750
- I don't like caviar.

32:13.958 --> 32:16.375
- I'll be done in five seconds.

32:18.708 --> 32:20.000
This will take a while.

32:22.250 --> 32:25.083
- I'm beginning to wonder
what is going on with Sierra.

32:25.083 --> 32:27.250
She has two courses
to do tonight

32:27.250 --> 32:29.458
and all she's doing is making

32:29.458 --> 32:33.875
the world's biggest salad.

32:33.875 --> 32:37.708
All right, let's get those
frosties over here, please.

32:37.708 --> 32:39.125
- Sierra, you're plating yours?
- Ready to go.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.625
- Perfect.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.042
So this course,
we have sashimi of conch.

32:43.042 --> 32:45.083
- Mmm.

32:45.083 --> 32:47.250
That's actually good.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.500
- Carolina.
- Oh, thank you.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.917
Here's a special salad for you.

32:49.917 --> 32:51.417
- Wow.

32:51.417 --> 32:53.167
- But am I gonna skip all
the 12 courses then?

32:53.167 --> 32:54.667
- Yes.
Yes, is that okay?

32:54.667 --> 32:56.167
- No, I don't want to stare

32:56.167 --> 32:58.125
when they get all the courses
and I don't.

32:58.125 --> 32:59.458
- Okay.
- Everyone stare at her.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.125
Everyone stare at Carolina.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.083
- No, I'm disappointed.
- How are we doing, Ben?

33:03.083 --> 33:05.000
- So far so good.
- How you doing?

33:05.000 --> 33:08.500
- Good. I'm just, like,
on standby, kitchen hand.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.583
- Yeah, she's amazing.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.333
- Ben?
- Yes?

33:11.333 --> 33:13.792
- She said she would like
to participate in the courses,

33:13.792 --> 33:16.583
so could you make her
a conch salad quickly?

33:16.583 --> 33:19.667
- What the actual f---?
- Sorry, Ben.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.333
- The preference sheet reads
in a very specific way--

33:21.333 --> 33:23.500
- She ate conch at lunch,
so maybe she's confused.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.458
- I just left all of it
over there.

33:25.458 --> 33:28.417
- She's confused.

33:30.375 --> 33:33.042
- This is the conch sashimi
if you want to try it.

33:33.042 --> 33:34.500
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.625
- Hmm-hmm-hmm.

33:44.375 --> 33:45.750
- Ohh.

33:47.875 --> 33:49.042
- All right, good.

33:49.042 --> 33:51.542
- A raspberry sorbet.

33:51.542 --> 33:52.875
- Coconut lobster fritter.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.167
- Pumpkin puree, ginger,
and lime.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.625
- Oh, here we go.

34:00.792 --> 34:02.458
- Tuna's next, honey bunny.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.208
- How many seconds
would you do it for? A minute?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.500
- Just sear the hell out of it.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.333
In the oil, yeah, yeah,
that's it.

34:08.333 --> 34:11.875
Now lay it on the oil.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.708
- Ooh.

34:13.708 --> 34:15.208
- Kate,
we need some glasses.

34:15.208 --> 34:16.542
- I heard.

34:16.542 --> 34:20.250
- Good.
- Okay, bring the tuna here.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.208
- Tuna's next course?
Is that what you're making next,

34:22.208 --> 34:23.750
so I know what cutlery
to put out next?

34:23.750 --> 34:26.125
- Yeah.

34:28.417 --> 34:31.875
Wait, hold on.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.917
- All right, just it's...

34:37.917 --> 34:39.917
the seared ahi tuna,

34:39.917 --> 34:44.750
it needs to be as aesthetically
pleasing as the raw tuna.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.500
That tuna's f---ed.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.583
But this is not the case.

34:48.583 --> 34:50.000
I don't want
to serve it anymore.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.500
It's just--it's f---ed.

34:55.250 --> 34:56.750
- We'll catch you
in the morning.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.292
- The battle is on,
no matter who wins...

34:59.292 --> 35:00.583
- Oh, no, no.

35:10.750 --> 35:12.917
- That tuna's f---ed.

35:12.917 --> 35:14.375
I don't want
to serve it anymore.

35:14.375 --> 35:15.792
It's just--it's f---ed.

35:15.792 --> 35:18.042
Can you just take
that away, please?

35:21.792 --> 35:24.583
And then dump the rest.

35:25.792 --> 35:27.542
- Can I set it there?

35:27.542 --> 35:30.458
- Okay, that has baba ghanoush
on it, all right?

35:33.583 --> 35:35.000
- I was just doing
what I was told.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.833
I...I don't know.

35:36.833 --> 35:38.333
- Let's keep it going.
Ready?

35:38.333 --> 35:40.083
- Cheers.
Level's, you know...

35:40.083 --> 35:41.667
- Making you nervous?
Making you nervous?

35:41.667 --> 35:43.125
- Kind of ruins
the shape of it to be honest.

35:43.125 --> 35:44.667
- It's not ruining the shape.

35:44.667 --> 35:47.167
Here we have a blockade
of tuna over an orange

35:47.167 --> 35:50.167
Cointreau vinaigrette.

35:50.167 --> 35:52.125
- It looks like watermelon.
- Yay, watermelon.

35:52.125 --> 35:53.958
- Yeah, I can't.

35:53.958 --> 35:56.667
I'm just not big on raw fish.
It's too much.

35:56.667 --> 35:59.500
- You're not done yet, so...
- I understand that, baby.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.167
I understand that.

36:01.167 --> 36:02.625
Actually, I thought I was done.

36:17.292 --> 36:19.375
- Ooh, I'm so sorry.

36:19.375 --> 36:21.000
- F---.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.708
It's all right.
- Sorry.

36:22.708 --> 36:24.625
It's fine.
It's--it's an honest mistake.

36:24.625 --> 36:26.708
Sierra, I can see you're
a little rattled; it's all good.

36:26.708 --> 36:28.500
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.375
Chill, would you?
- Well, I just took plates out.

36:30.375 --> 36:31.875
- We had a little accident,
and that's okay, all right?

36:31.875 --> 36:33.875
- Yeah.
- All right? Good.

36:33.875 --> 36:36.875
- Like, ooh, I'm just gonna
let that happen by itself.

36:36.875 --> 36:38.333
- Can I take it then?

36:38.333 --> 36:40.625
- Yeah, just--please, all right?
- Well--

36:40.625 --> 36:44.208
- You're making Sierra
very nervous tonight, babe.

36:44.208 --> 36:45.708
- Uh-huh.

36:45.708 --> 36:48.375
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

36:48.375 --> 36:53.000
Grilled calamari steak
with a roasted garlic tomato.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.542
Okay, I'll try it.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.208
I'm not picky.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.167
Oh, it's 10:30.

37:04.167 --> 37:07.250
- What course are we on?
- I have no idea.

37:07.250 --> 37:10.167
- Just do the edges on that.
That's good.

37:10.167 --> 37:11.542
- Thank you.

37:11.542 --> 37:14.333
- Thank you, Kate.
- This is a mango sorbet

37:14.333 --> 37:17.250
to get you ready
for the next course.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.083
- All right, let's get
this lamb dish out the way.

37:19.083 --> 37:20.583
- Babe, Emily?

37:20.583 --> 37:22.250
- Yes?
- Emily, since you're on earlies

37:22.250 --> 37:23.542
why don't you go ahead
and go down for the night?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.000
- Okay, night-night.
- Good night.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.667
- Thank you.

37:33.667 --> 37:36.208
- What time do we need
to be up by tomorrow?

37:36.208 --> 37:38.250
- I think they're getting
kind of tired and--

37:38.250 --> 37:39.583
- How's John?

37:39.583 --> 37:41.042
- Mmm.
- He's happy.

37:41.042 --> 37:42.750
- That's all that matters.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.083
- Okay, and I'll only
tell you about him.

37:44.083 --> 37:47.708
Lamb.
- All right, thanks.

37:47.708 --> 37:49.833
- Ooh.
- Here we have lamb lollipops.

37:51.042 --> 37:52.750
- Oh, that's good lamb.

37:54.917 --> 37:56.250
- Oh, f---.

37:58.458 --> 38:01.542
- I won't, do worry,
Kate will kill me.

38:05.542 --> 38:09.208
- Nothing, I've just got to fold
this machine, and then I'm done.

38:09.208 --> 38:11.458
I'm done.
- Give me some of that.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.417
I'm not sure
where Emily stands.

38:13.417 --> 38:16.458
I've thrown out some hints
to her that I'm interested,

38:16.458 --> 38:18.958
but she gives off
the weirdest signs though.

38:18.958 --> 38:21.375
- You looked so sleepy
when you got up this morning.

38:23.167 --> 38:25.333
I wish I could read British.

38:25.333 --> 38:27.000
- Obviously.

38:31.292 --> 38:32.833
- Bang.
Gosh, let's do it.

38:32.833 --> 38:35.083
- All right, all right,
here we go.

38:42.667 --> 38:44.917
- Flourless chocolate cake,
chocolate sauce,

38:44.917 --> 38:47.292
homemade vanilla ice cream,
spun sugar.

38:50.792 --> 38:53.583
- This is the final
grand finale 12th course.

38:53.583 --> 38:55.333
- Wow look at that.
- I told you.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.000
- Cheers to this.
- Mmm.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.875
- How's it going, Em?
How'd tonight go?

39:02.667 --> 39:04.375
- Is she?
- I want to get the full picture

39:04.375 --> 39:09.292
before I decipher anything.
I just don't really--

39:09.292 --> 39:11.167
I'll talk to her, kind of figure
out what happened.

39:11.167 --> 39:12.875
- Are you doing them in
quarters?

39:12.875 --> 39:14.375
- Well, I just go like that.
- Okay.

39:17.542 --> 39:19.875
- I've done stew work before.
- Oh, really?

39:19.875 --> 39:21.542
- My first boat
was an all-male crew.

39:21.542 --> 39:24.375
- The guys good at?
- We were very good.

39:25.792 --> 39:27.542
- He's a sneaky one, that
Kelley.

39:27.542 --> 39:30.875
He's kind of just cock-blocking.
He puts his shirt off.

39:30.875 --> 39:33.042
How's everything
going interior-wise?

39:33.042 --> 39:34.500
- I think really good.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.042
I like our team.
- That's good.

39:36.042 --> 39:38.042
That's all that matters,
you know.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.875
You put out positive things,

39:39.875 --> 39:41.542
and you'll get positive things
back towards you.

39:41.542 --> 39:42.958
You know what I mean?

39:42.958 --> 39:44.417
- That's a good thing
really to think.

39:44.417 --> 39:48.000
Yeah.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.667
- What up?
- What's up?

39:49.667 --> 39:51.375
- It's nice
getting male attention.

39:51.375 --> 39:53.417
It's needed sometimes,
and who doesn't like it?

39:53.417 --> 39:57.750
But Nico and Kelley, it's quite
amusing, and it's very sweet.

39:57.750 --> 39:59.417
- Have a good night.
- Night, all. Sleep well.

39:59.417 --> 40:01.083
- We'll catch you
in the morning.

40:01.083 --> 40:02.250
- Yeah, we'll have
a good day tomorrow.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.250
- Thanks.
- See you later.

40:07.250 --> 40:09.417
- Thought you were going to bed?

40:09.417 --> 40:13.417
- Work first, friendship second,
women third.

40:13.417 --> 40:15.083
The battle is on.

40:15.083 --> 40:17.042
No matter who wins,
friendship doesn't change.

40:17.042 --> 40:18.917
- Oh, no, no.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.708
- Or I'll have you
scrubbing the hull.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.875
- You did it.
- Yeah.

40:26.875 --> 40:28.750
- Give me a hug.
That was incredible.

40:28.750 --> 40:30.458
We're all done.

40:30.458 --> 40:33.458
- I couldn't have done
it without you, honestly.

40:33.458 --> 40:36.917
- This--I'm just really upset.

40:36.917 --> 40:39.417
I just wanted to f---ing, like,
go home, like...

40:51.083 --> 40:52.542
- Whoo, unbelievable.
- How was it?

40:52.542 --> 40:54.125
Was it?
- Awesome.

40:54.125 --> 40:56.250
- You are most welcome.
That was a fantastic meal.

40:56.250 --> 40:58.458
- One, two, three.

40:58.458 --> 41:00.458
- It was a pleasure
and a privilege, cheers.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.958
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

41:01.958 --> 41:02.958
- We had a good time.
- Good night.

41:02.958 --> 41:04.625
- Better make it a night.

41:04.625 --> 41:07.000
The 12-course
meal might be the way forward,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
'cause it keeps the guests
at the table for so long,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.458
by the end of it,
they're begging to go to bed.

41:11.458 --> 41:13.292
It's genius.

41:13.292 --> 41:14.833
- All right, hon,
I'm off to bed.

41:14.833 --> 41:16.000
- All right, honey bun.

41:18.958 --> 41:21.792
It's not cool.
It's just not.

41:21.792 --> 41:23.458
- Are you okay?

41:23.458 --> 41:25.792
- Oh, I don't know.
- She's not happy.

41:25.792 --> 41:28.125
- Listen...
- Just chill. It's all good.

41:28.125 --> 41:29.750
- You're not the chef
on this boat.

41:29.750 --> 41:31.250
There's no reason
you should feel bad

41:31.250 --> 41:33.250
about anything
that happened this evening.

41:33.250 --> 41:35.292
You're a hard worker.
You have a positive attitude.

41:35.292 --> 41:38.083
- You dealt with a very
stressful situation tonight.

41:38.083 --> 41:40.167
It was 12 courses.

41:40.167 --> 41:42.417
The old school
of cooking was brutal.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.667
You know, we used to get plates
thrown at us,

41:44.667 --> 41:47.667
sauce pans around the back
of the f---ing head.

41:47.667 --> 41:50.000
- I know, I know.
- I mean, you know, obviously,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.042
I was stressed out about it.

41:52.042 --> 41:56.333
Now it's like, if I shout
at someone it's like "Oh, God."

41:56.333 --> 42:00.208
- I can't deal with this.
It's so f---ed up.

42:07.375 --> 42:12.208
- If you're sensitive,
stay out of the f---ing kitchen.

42:12.208 --> 42:15.542
- I'm over it.

42:20.208 --> 42:23.625
- Try and just get through
the next few days.

42:23.625 --> 42:27.500
- This negative energy, like,
this is not for me.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.250
- Next on "Below Deck"...

42:33.250 --> 42:35.500
- Sierra, she, like,
broke down last night.

42:35.500 --> 42:37.000
She lost it.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.542
- I don't want her
to become discouraged.

42:38.542 --> 42:40.750
- Absolutely.
- I can't wait to come home.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.417
- We will be getting
our new deckhand.

42:42.417 --> 42:44.042
- For this shadow?
- Yep, he's pretty green.

42:44.042 --> 42:45.583
- Oh, f---.

42:45.583 --> 42:47.542
- Like, under that cabinet,
like, under?

42:47.542 --> 42:49.375
- We just met, Sierra, you're
making me bend over already?

42:49.375 --> 42:50.583
- No, no, you're--
- Sierra's looking nice.

42:50.583 --> 42:52.042
She has the Alaskan face.

42:54.250 --> 42:56.750
- I turned into
the freak--freak machine.

42:56.750 --> 42:58.000
- Oh, my God,
he just tried to kiss me.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.500
He just tried to...

43:00.917 --> 43:05.042
- Come in.
- But I find you so attractive.

43:05.042 --> 43:07.167
- F---, you all right, Kyle?
Is he all right? What happened?

43:07.167 --> 43:08.833
- You all right?
- F---ing hell.

43:08.833 --> 43:10.917
- Oh, my God.
Holy sh--.

43:12.625 --> 43:15.667
- For more "Below Deck," go
