01:53.810 --> 01:57.370
The future has not been written.

01:57.550 --> 02:01.350
There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

02:15.830 --> 02:19.000
I wish I could believe that.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.700
My name is John Connor.

02:25.510 --> 02:28.440
They tried to murder me before I was born.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.910
When I was 13, they tried again.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.180
Machines from the future.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.980
Terminators.

02:39.690 --> 02:43.680
All my life, my mother told me
the storm was coming.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.120
- Judgment Day.
- Connor!

02:46.700 --> 02:50.190
The beginning of a war
between man and machines.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.870
Three billion lives
would vanish in an instant.

02:56.710 --> 03:02.170
And I would lead what was left
of the human race to ultimate victory.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.380
It hasn't happened.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.940
No bombs fell.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.650
Computers didn't take control.

03:13.560 --> 03:17.010
We stopped Judgment Day.

03:19.230 --> 03:22.290
I should feel safe...

03:23.070 --> 03:25.400
...but I don't.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.530
So I live off the grid.

03:29.710 --> 03:34.230
No phone, no address.

03:34.410 --> 03:39.070
No one and nothing can find me.

03:39.250 --> 03:43.550
I've erased all connections to the past.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.080
But as hard as I try...

03:47.420 --> 03:50.450
...I can't erase my dreams...

03:50.630 --> 03:53.490
...my nightmares.

05:05.500 --> 05:10.230
I feel the weight of the future
bearing down on me.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.900
A future I don't want.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.670
So I keep running...

05:16.850 --> 05:18.810
...as fast as I can.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.440
Anywhere.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.950
Nowhere.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.720
Oh, my God.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.760
Are you okay?

07:13.900 --> 07:16.020
Do you want me to call 911?

07:19.340 --> 07:21.200
I like this car.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.430
What are you-?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.800
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

08:30.970 --> 08:33.309
Slow down and pull over immediately.

09:05.810 --> 09:09.210
Lady, have you any idea
how fast you were going?

09:09.380 --> 09:11.350
Let me see your license and registration.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.650
I like your gun.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.020
What?

09:20.690 --> 09:24.560
This stupid thing's not working.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.960
What's wrong with this thing?

09:28.130 --> 09:31.290
I hate machines.

09:33.170 --> 09:36.230
- Hello?
- Kate, it's your father.

09:36.570 --> 09:39.740
You're blowing me off again.

09:40.010 --> 09:43.100
I'm so sorry. You know how much
I wanted to see you this weekend.

09:43.280 --> 09:48.240
- But we're having computer problems-
- I know, you can't talk about it.

09:48.580 --> 09:49.920
It's just...

09:50.750 --> 09:53.020
...Scott was really looking forward to this.

09:53.260 --> 09:58.190
Katie. I wish I had more time
to get to know him. I really do.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.230
That's okay. You're bound
to run into him at the wedding.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.630
Please. I'm still
in a state of denial about that.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.230
- You're not the only one.
- Hey, kiddo.

10:09.410 --> 10:11.870
You don't need me
to pass judgment on this guy.

10:12.110 --> 10:14.370
You've done the right thing
your whole life.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.910
You won't make a mistake. You never do.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.380
I'm the luckiest father
in the world, you know?

10:20.550 --> 10:23.950
I've never had to be afraid
for my daughter.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.950
Listen, I hate this. I gotta run.
Come see me. I promise I won't cancel.

10:28.220 --> 10:29.280
We will.

10:29.460 --> 10:32.390
- Bye, Dad, I love you.
- Love you too.

10:45.410 --> 10:48.970
- Okay, what have we got?
- This new computer virus is tricky.

10:49.250 --> 10:52.840
It's infected half the civilian Internet
as well as secondary military apps.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.810
- Payroll, inventory.
- Primary defense nets are still clean?

10:56.090 --> 10:58.250
So far the firewalls are holding up.

10:58.490 --> 11:02.180
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use
our Al to scan the infrastructure.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.830
Search and destroy
for any hint of the virus.

11:05.090 --> 11:08.330
I know, Tony, but that's like
going after a fly with a bazooka.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.130
Once the connection's made,
it should only be a few minutes.

11:11.300 --> 11:15.670
During which we've put everything under
the control of a single computer system.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.640
The most intelligent system
ever conceived.

11:18.810 --> 11:21.780
I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.110
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.170
Yes, sir.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.710
Thanks.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.550
You're supposed to go around
to the back.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.680
Hey, I said you're supposed to go-

14:59.400 --> 15:02.330
- Take off your clothes.
- Patience, honey.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.270
Bitch. Wait your turn.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.500
- Your clothes.
- Talk to the hand.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.010
Now.

16:37.890 --> 16:40.620
Welcome to Jim's Burgers.
Can I take your order?

16:40.900 --> 16:44.630
- Jose Barrera?
- Yeah, that's me.

17:03.150 --> 17:06.819
Growing concern over widespread outages
in the global digital network...

17:07.089 --> 17:10.420
...have prompted rumors
of a new computer super-virus.

17:10.589 --> 17:14.150
- Wall Street analysts are confident...
- Shit! My mom's home.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.390
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer.
Here. Take that.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.470
Go, go, go.

17:25.540 --> 17:29.100
Elizabeth and William Anderson?

17:29.780 --> 17:34.220
I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs.
Is there something wrong?

17:47.230 --> 17:48.860
What's going on?

17:49.030 --> 17:52.230
I have to go to the clinic.
It's an emergency.

17:52.570 --> 17:54.560
It's 4:30 in the morning.

17:55.070 --> 17:58.470
Well, I'll be back before you get up.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.440
Cool it, guys, it's just me.

18:44.620 --> 18:48.020
We've got a sick cat coming in.

19:09.910 --> 19:11.070
Great.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.640
Junkies.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.920
Please, don't do that.

19:24.790 --> 19:27.160
I suppose it was you who
ripped us off last week.

19:27.330 --> 19:30.160
Put the phone down.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.260
Sorry.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.130
I just...

19:35.300 --> 19:37.400
I needed some medicine.

19:37.570 --> 19:41.170
There's an emergency clinic
half a mile away.

19:41.340 --> 19:42.940
Can't do that.

19:47.950 --> 19:50.420
How much did you take?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.350
- Enough.
- Well...

19:52.960 --> 19:56.190
...this is the stuff we use
to chemically neuter dogs.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.490
Take a look.

20:02.460 --> 20:03.800
Hey!

20:09.300 --> 20:11.500
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

20:12.340 --> 20:14.830
Next time bring a clue,
not a paintball gun.

20:15.010 --> 20:18.500
- No, this isn't what you think.
- Yeah, right.

20:37.130 --> 20:41.540
It's Hercules. I think he's got pneumonia.
He started coughing and wouldn't stop.

20:41.700 --> 20:46.160
- Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.
- A problem? This is an emergency!

20:46.440 --> 20:49.930
- It sounds like a hairball.
- I know what a hairball sounds like.

20:50.110 --> 20:53.240
- Where's Dr. Monroe?
- It's 5:30 in the morning.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.710
I'm sure he's home sleeping.
He'll come in if he has to.

20:57.520 --> 21:02.180
Just wait in here with Hercules
and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

21:18.870 --> 21:22.170
Mike Kripke's basement.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.710
What? What does that mean?

21:38.060 --> 21:39.790
You're John Connor.

21:44.300 --> 21:47.560
I'm Kate Brewster.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.070
We went to
West Hills Junior High together.

21:57.580 --> 22:00.740
- Jesus.
- What happened to you, John?

22:01.120 --> 22:05.020
Middle of eighth grade,
you just disappeared.

22:05.190 --> 22:08.520
And there was that thing
about your foster parents.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.420
Yeah, they were murdered.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.890
I didn't do it.

22:17.330 --> 22:19.390
What the hell?

22:19.570 --> 22:22.160
Is somebody with you?

22:44.630 --> 22:46.060
Katherine Brewster?

23:02.980 --> 23:04.310
No.

24:54.090 --> 24:57.180
John Connor was here.
Where did he go?

24:57.930 --> 25:00.660
Tell me. Where did he go?

25:40.470 --> 25:41.870
Katherine Brewster?

25:46.680 --> 25:49.140
What are you doing? Let me down!

25:49.480 --> 25:52.710
Let me down! Let me down!

25:54.980 --> 25:57.450
Where is John Connor?

25:57.620 --> 26:00.490
If I tell you, will you let me go?

26:00.990 --> 26:02.820
Yes.

26:02.990 --> 26:05.320
He's...

26:05.490 --> 26:08.660
...in the kennel, in a cage.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.530
You said that you'd let me go.

26:14.770 --> 26:16.260
I lied.

26:16.440 --> 26:21.880
Please, please, please.
You have to let me go!

27:09.660 --> 27:12.720
John Connor.

27:14.330 --> 27:17.030
It is time.

27:17.900 --> 27:20.660
You here to kill me?

27:26.470 --> 27:29.570
No. You must live.

27:40.360 --> 27:44.190
- Why are you here? Where are we going?
- Keep moving.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.260
Get out of here.

27:50.370 --> 27:52.090
Now!

28:40.920 --> 28:43.410
- No pulse.
- See if you can get him down.

28:45.090 --> 28:46.950
I can't.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.150
This guy weighs a ton.

29:13.620 --> 29:16.910
- 911.
- Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

29:17.090 --> 29:20.610
- Where are you now?
- I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.290
It's a Toyota Tundra.

29:23.630 --> 29:28.890
It says "Emery Animal Hospital"
on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.300
Hello?

29:32.170 --> 29:34.530
Hello?

29:36.970 --> 29:39.240
Shit! Shit!

30:53.110 --> 30:54.780
Get off.

31:10.970 --> 31:11.950
Let me out!

31:12.370 --> 31:13.830
What are you doing here?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.530
You tell me. You got me into this.

31:17.010 --> 31:19.200
- Stop the car.
- I can't. Not yet.

31:19.370 --> 31:23.400
- You bastard! Stop the car!
- Shut up!

31:35.020 --> 31:37.420
Son of a bitch.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.020
Goddamn it.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.190
Look what you did to my car.

31:42.360 --> 31:45.660
This is my company car, asshole.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.360
Get your ass out here.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.730
Get your ass out of the car. Now!

31:50.000 --> 31:51.800
What are you doing?

31:52.210 --> 31:55.070
If you don't have insurance,
I'm gonna rip your balls off.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.510
- I don't want any problems, okay?
- Shut up!

31:57.780 --> 31:58.770
Help!

31:59.050 --> 32:01.210
Who's talking back there?
What's going on?

32:01.520 --> 32:02.570
- Calm down.
- Shut up!

32:02.750 --> 32:06.520
- I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!
- Well, I'll be goddamned.

32:06.690 --> 32:08.550
- Call 911!
- A cop when you need one.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.550
Help, please! Please!

32:10.960 --> 32:13.550
Let me out of here! Help!

32:16.300 --> 32:19.030
Get back here, asshole!

32:41.660 --> 32:43.920
That's the cops!
You have to pull over!

32:44.090 --> 32:45.720
Yeah, first chance I get.

33:51.390 --> 33:52.790
Hold on!

35:02.730 --> 35:04.930
Stop it!

36:10.670 --> 36:12.000
I'll drive.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.430
Get out.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.060
Excuse me.

38:03.410 --> 38:04.640
Move over.

38:34.710 --> 38:37.040
No sign of brain trauma.

38:38.510 --> 38:41.110
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.850
Do you even remember me?

38:48.990 --> 38:52.520
Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?

38:52.760 --> 38:56.090
"Hasta la vista, baby."
Ring any bells?

38:56.260 --> 38:58.750
That was a different T-101.

38:59.230 --> 39:01.630
What, do you come off an assembly line
or something?

39:01.800 --> 39:03.000
Exactly.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.140
Oh, man. I'm gonna have
to teach you everything all over again.

39:08.910 --> 39:12.170
Katherine Brewster,
have you sustained injury?

39:12.550 --> 39:15.010
Drop dead, you asshole!

39:16.250 --> 39:18.740
I'm unable to comply.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.760
Where are you taking me?

39:29.930 --> 39:32.090
To a safe location.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.280
All right, get off at the next exit.
Let her out.

39:51.450 --> 39:54.680
Negative.
Katherine Brewster must be protected.

39:55.190 --> 39:58.490
- I thought I was the one they were after.
- You could not be located.

39:58.660 --> 40:03.150
So a T-X was sent back through time
to eliminate your lieutenants.

40:04.230 --> 40:08.130
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

40:11.240 --> 40:14.500
No, no.
No, you shouldn't even exist.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.200
I mean,
we took out Cyberdyne over 10 years ago.

40:17.380 --> 40:21.210
- We stopped Judgment Day.
- You only postponed it.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.580
Judgment Day is inevitable.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.080
I require a cutting tool.

40:40.030 --> 40:42.300
Here, take the wheel.

40:45.570 --> 40:49.130
- What are you doing?
- I am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells.

40:49.310 --> 40:52.610
My primary cell was damaged
by a plasma attack.

40:52.880 --> 40:56.910
T- X is designed for extreme combat,
driven by a plasma reactor...

40:57.080 --> 40:59.050
...and equipped with onboard weapons.

40:59.220 --> 41:00.550
Its arsenal includes...

41:00.720 --> 41:03.280
...nanotechnological transjectors.

41:03.460 --> 41:07.330
- Meaning?
- It can control other machines.

41:09.400 --> 41:14.460
Its body chassis is heavily armored
and hardened to withstand external attack.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.800
- You'll find a way to destroy her.
- Unlikely.

41:19.270 --> 41:21.210
I'm an obsolete design.

41:21.380 --> 41:25.710
T- X is faster, more powerful
and more intelligent.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.820
It's a far more effective
killing machine.

41:28.980 --> 41:30.810
Oh, great.

41:30.990 --> 41:32.250
That's great.

41:33.790 --> 41:36.450
My presence in this timeline
has been anticipated.

41:36.990 --> 41:41.050
T- X is designed to terminate
other cybernetic organisms.

41:41.230 --> 41:46.330
So she's an anti-Terminator
Terminator?

41:47.740 --> 41:49.400
You've gotta be shitting me.

41:49.570 --> 41:53.010
No, I am not shitting you.

42:08.320 --> 42:12.490
When ruptured,
the fuel cells become unstable.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.290
Relax.

42:14.460 --> 42:17.950
- Let me out of here!
- Relax!

42:38.950 --> 42:40.390
Man, this is wack.

42:40.550 --> 42:43.750
It's been like this for hours.
Every goddamn station.

43:05.550 --> 43:07.070
Hey.

43:07.510 --> 43:10.110
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

43:14.360 --> 43:16.220
Talk to the hand.

43:32.640 --> 43:35.440
Help! Help me!

43:35.940 --> 43:37.600
Help!

43:41.320 --> 43:43.410
I think we better go.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.070
Jerky?

44:17.950 --> 44:20.220
You're kidnapping me.

44:21.160 --> 44:23.520
- Look-
- God, you were always a delinquent.

44:23.690 --> 44:27.630
And look at you now, sitting there
like the bad boy thing still works.

44:27.800 --> 44:30.660
What are you,
some kind of gang member?

44:30.830 --> 44:33.230
How do you live with yourself?

44:35.470 --> 44:37.030
What?

44:41.510 --> 44:43.100
Tell her who I am.

44:43.280 --> 44:48.980
John Connor is leader of the Worldwide
Resistance and last hope of humankind.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.950
Right. And him?

44:53.950 --> 44:56.350
He's a robot from the future.

44:56.520 --> 45:00.190
Living tissue over a metal skeleton,
sent back in time to protect me.

45:00.360 --> 45:02.160
Go to hell.

45:02.900 --> 45:05.490
He doesn't mean you any harm.

45:06.700 --> 45:08.790
I have a fiance.

45:08.970 --> 45:11.130
He's gonna be looking for me.

45:11.310 --> 45:13.710
What is it that you want?

45:15.510 --> 45:17.000
Just...

45:17.780 --> 45:19.580
...imagine...

45:21.050 --> 45:25.210
...if you knew you were gonna do
something important with your life.

45:25.390 --> 45:27.680
Something amazing.

45:28.090 --> 45:31.720
Maybe the most important thing
anyone has ever done.

45:32.360 --> 45:33.990
But there's a catch.

45:34.930 --> 45:37.620
Something terrible has to happen.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.440
You couldn't...

45:44.840 --> 45:48.770
...live with yourself if you didn't try
to stop it, but...

45:48.940 --> 45:50.600
What are you talking about?

45:53.180 --> 45:56.450
It's just- The life you know...

45:56.750 --> 45:59.720
...all the stuff that
you take for granted...

46:00.820 --> 46:02.050
...it's not gonna last.

46:08.900 --> 46:10.260
Mike Kripke.

46:10.600 --> 46:14.090
Back there, why did you say
"Kripke's basement"?

46:14.270 --> 46:15.860
Because Mike Kripke's house...

46:16.040 --> 46:19.370
...that's where the kids used
to go make out, right?

46:23.740 --> 46:26.910
So you and me-
Wait, did we...?

46:28.280 --> 46:30.750
Holy shit, we did.

46:30.920 --> 46:35.580
We made out in Kripke's basement.
I cannot believe you remembered that.

46:36.660 --> 46:40.960
I must have made
some kind of impression.

46:41.130 --> 46:42.490
Give me a break.

46:42.830 --> 46:46.230
I only remembered because
the next day you were in the news.

46:51.570 --> 46:56.440
Wait a second. You and me hooked up
the day before I first met him.

46:57.510 --> 47:00.610
And now again, 10 years later.

47:02.350 --> 47:04.980
We were supposed to meet.

47:06.150 --> 47:08.250
Coincidence.

47:13.290 --> 47:14.950
Yeah.

47:40.490 --> 47:43.350
Hon? Did you just get in?

48:02.610 --> 48:05.870
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D.
This is Detective Bell.

48:06.610 --> 48:09.210
We're looking for Katherine Brewster.
Is she here?

48:09.380 --> 48:10.580
No.

48:10.750 --> 48:15.150
- You're her fiance, Scott Mason?
- Yes.

48:15.320 --> 48:19.190
There was an incident at the
veterinary hospital where she works.

48:19.360 --> 48:22.060
We're concerned something
may have happened to her.

48:22.230 --> 48:23.390
Where is she?

48:23.660 --> 48:27.030
We got a report from a gas station
attendant near Victorville...

48:27.200 --> 48:31.100
...about a possible kidnapping
and it might be related.

48:31.270 --> 48:33.570
I'll help you find her.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.280
Come with me.

48:51.860 --> 48:53.350
Go.

49:21.320 --> 49:22.950
Your mother?

49:25.460 --> 49:28.430
I never even knew
where she was buried.

49:31.330 --> 49:34.230
I hit the road the day she died.

49:38.070 --> 49:40.370
Why did you bring me here?

49:44.340 --> 49:45.810
No! What are you doing?

49:45.980 --> 49:47.500
Hey, stop!

49:47.750 --> 49:49.080
Get away from it! Stop!

49:56.760 --> 49:59.320
Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.

49:59.490 --> 50:01.790
Her friends scattered her ashes
in the sea.

50:02.160 --> 50:05.390
They stored these weapons
in accordance with her will.

50:06.870 --> 50:08.360
What happened to her?

50:10.000 --> 50:11.870
Leukemia.

50:14.780 --> 50:16.680
I'm sorry.

50:18.350 --> 50:21.840
We were living in Baja
when she was diagnosed.

50:23.520 --> 50:26.210
They only gave her six months.

50:27.220 --> 50:30.280
But she fought for three years.

50:32.790 --> 50:34.990
Long enough to make sure.

50:36.900 --> 50:39.020
To make sure?

50:41.540 --> 50:44.000
That the world didn't end.

50:50.240 --> 50:52.300
"Every day after this one is a gift."

50:52.480 --> 50:55.350
She told me, "We made it. We're free."

50:58.190 --> 51:00.810
But I never really believed that.

51:03.860 --> 51:06.260
I guess she didn't either.

51:08.060 --> 51:11.760
You know you were about
the closest thing to a father I ever had?

51:12.930 --> 51:14.730
How pathetic is that?

51:16.270 --> 51:17.500
Out of my way!

51:20.870 --> 51:22.870
My mission is to protect you.

51:23.740 --> 51:25.010
That's enough.

51:26.610 --> 51:30.050
Move or I'll do it!
I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

51:30.920 --> 51:33.390
Go ahead. See what happens.

51:48.140 --> 51:49.800
Don't do that.

51:51.870 --> 51:53.930
Oh, my God.

52:00.050 --> 52:03.410
This is the police.
We have the building surrounded.

52:03.580 --> 52:05.740
Release your hostage!

52:24.640 --> 52:28.400
Just leave me here. I'm not the one
you want. You're wasting your time.

52:28.580 --> 52:32.640
Incorrect. John Connor
leads the Resistance to victory.

52:32.810 --> 52:34.070
How?

52:34.250 --> 52:35.840
Why? Why me?

52:36.280 --> 52:38.250
You are John Connor.

52:38.720 --> 52:42.920
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit
since the cradle.

52:43.260 --> 52:45.990
Look at me.
I'm no leader, I never was!

52:46.160 --> 52:48.250
I'm never gonna-

52:52.270 --> 52:53.700
Let go.

52:54.130 --> 52:57.000
You're right.
You're not the one I want.

52:57.270 --> 52:59.570
I'm wasting my time.

53:01.470 --> 53:05.930
Fuck you, you fucking machine!

53:06.750 --> 53:08.270
Better.

53:10.480 --> 53:12.540
Oh, you were just dicking with me?

53:12.720 --> 53:15.450
Anger is more useful than despair.

53:15.620 --> 53:17.180
What?

53:17.360 --> 53:20.820
Basic psychology is among
my subroutines.

53:25.100 --> 53:27.160
Perps still holed up?

53:28.270 --> 53:29.360
Gotcha.

53:29.540 --> 53:32.060
Good news. Your fiancee's okay.

53:32.240 --> 53:33.330
Where is she?

53:33.510 --> 53:36.000
Greenlawn Cemetery,
up off the 5 freeway.

53:36.210 --> 53:40.150
It's right by the desert.
But they're gonna bring her back to the-

53:41.110 --> 53:43.580
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

54:13.950 --> 54:17.410
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

54:17.980 --> 54:21.150
Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

54:21.320 --> 54:24.650
I'm a post-trauma counselor
for the sheriff's department.

54:24.820 --> 54:26.850
How are you feeling?

54:27.630 --> 54:29.620
He's not human.

54:29.960 --> 54:34.130
He's really not human.

54:36.570 --> 54:40.030
I know what it's like to be
in a hostage situation.

54:40.210 --> 54:42.270
I've been there myself.

54:42.440 --> 54:45.570
The fear, the adrenaline.

54:45.750 --> 54:49.650
You find yourself imagining things.

54:50.180 --> 54:52.740
Impossible things.

54:53.450 --> 54:55.650
Crazy things.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.150
Insane things.

55:01.130 --> 55:03.990
Take years to get over it.

55:05.230 --> 55:07.670
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!

55:13.340 --> 55:14.640
Drop your weapon!

55:18.410 --> 55:20.440
And the coffin!

55:22.750 --> 55:25.270
Take him down! Take him down!

56:06.190 --> 56:08.250
Resume fire!

56:15.300 --> 56:17.700
We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

56:18.470 --> 56:21.410
Why? What makes her
so goddamn important?

56:21.570 --> 56:25.910
Through her, you contact remnants of the
military and learn how to fight Skynet...

56:26.210 --> 56:28.580
...forming the core
of the Resistance.

56:28.750 --> 56:31.380
Later,
your children will become important.

56:32.290 --> 56:35.310
- What?
- She's your wife.

57:34.180 --> 57:35.880
Get in!

57:36.050 --> 57:37.570
Do you want to live? Come on!

57:59.940 --> 58:03.310
- It was Scott! How could it be Scott?
- Your fiance?

58:03.480 --> 58:07.470
The T-X is polymimetic,
able to take the form of anything it touches.

58:08.250 --> 58:10.310
Your fiance is dead.

58:34.870 --> 58:35.900
Oh, my God!

58:41.580 --> 58:42.710
Do something!

59:13.750 --> 59:15.440
Get down.

59:37.940 --> 59:40.200
We need a new vehicle.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.650
Hey, come on.

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.950
We gotta keep moving.

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:11.690
She killed Scott because of me.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.770
Look, I know this won't help...

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:28.540
...but sometimes things happen
that we just can't change.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.040
It's not your fault.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.730
Are you sure about this?

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.010
About her and me, I mean.

01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:58.800
Your confusion is not rational.
She's a healthy female of breeding age.

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.840
There's more to it than that.

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:05.710
My database does not encompass
the dynamics of human pair bonding.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.850
So this Terminatrix, how many others
does she have on her hit list?

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.920
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth.
Anderson, William.

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.860
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:22.300
My father?

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:27.500
Having failed to acquire its primary target,
T- X will resume its default program.

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:31.730
- She's gonna kill my father too?
- There's a high probability.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.840
- No.
- Who is he? What does he do?

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:39.510
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design,
secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:43.450
General Robert Brewster
is program director of CRS...

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:47.560
...Cyber Research Systems,
autonomous weapons division.

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:50.630
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.100
Skynet is one of the digital defense systems
developed under Brewster.

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:56.760
Oh, God.

01:02:57.170 --> 01:03:00.400
Oh, my God. Of course.

01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:02.240
It all makes sense now.

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:06.510
If you hadn't come back when I was a kid,
changed everything...

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.780
...she and I would have gotten together
then. I would have met her father.

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:13.580
- Don't you see?
- I don't understand.

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:17.690
Your father.
This is all about your father.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.450
He's the key. He always was. Your father
is the one who can shut Skynet down.

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.330
He's the only one who ever could.

01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:30.400
We have to get to him
before the T-X does.

01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:35.100
- Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.
- This is your mission, to save people!

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:39.210
My mission is to ensure the survival
of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.280
I am giving you an order.

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:45.040
I am not programmed
to follow your orders.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.280
- After the nuclear war, you both-
- Nuclear war?!

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:51.510
There doesn't have to be a war!
We can stop it!

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:53.890
There is insufficient time.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.220
The first launch sequences
will be initiated at 6:18 p. m.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.160
- What, today?
- Affirmative.

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:03.030
John, what is he saying?

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:06.160
Judgment Day.

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.740
The end of the world.

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:13.080
It's today, three hours from now.

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:15.570
Two hours and 53 minutes.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:20.810
We must continue south into Mexico
to escape the primary blast zones.

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:24.350
No, we have to get to her dad.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:29.930
The Mojave area will sustain
significant nuclear fallout.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.720
You will not survive.

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:36.900
You mean we go run and hide somewhere
in a hole while the bombs fall?

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:39.200
It is your destiny.

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:44.710
- Fuck my destiny.
- John.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.510
You cannot self-terminate.

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:54.490
No, you can't.
I can do whatever I want.

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:57.450
I'm a human being.
I'm not some goddamn robot.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.420
- Cybernetic organism.
- Whatever!

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:02.460
Either we get her father
to shut Skynet down...

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:07.360
...stop this shit from ever happening,
or so much for the great John Connor.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:12.530
Because your future, my destiny,
I don't want any part of it. I never did.

01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:17.910
Based on your pupil dilation,
skin temperature and motor functions...

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:24.310
...I calculate an 83% probability
that you will not pull the trigger.

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:32.790
Please do what he says.
You have to save my father!

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.520
We can reach CRS
in approximately one hour...

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.460
...depending on traffic conditions.

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.490
I can't get a line.

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.400
The whole cell network is down.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.500
Skynet is assuming control
over global communications...

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:20.000
...in preparation for its attack.

01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:24.340
So if this war is between people
and machines...

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.870
...why are you on our side?

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:30.980
The Resistance captured me
and reprogrammed my CPU.

01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:34.640
I was originally designed
for assassination missions.

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:39.110
So...

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:43.330
...you don't really care
if this mission succeeds or not.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.860
If we get killed,
does that mean anything to you?

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:51.300
If you were to die,
I will become useless.

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:54.600
There will be no reason for me to exist.

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.310
Thank you for doing this.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.470
Your gratitude is not required.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:07.580
I am programmed
to follow your commands.

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:09.990
Her commands?

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:15.530
Katherine Brewster had me reactivated and
sent through the time displacement field.

01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:19.320
What exactly am I in this
future of yours?

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.200
You're John Connor's spouse
and second-in-command.

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:27.040
No, I-

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.000
What?

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.840
You're a mess.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:38.250
Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.240
Why didn't I send you back?

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.720
I am not authorized
to answer your question.

01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:48.980
- Why didn't he send you back?
- He was dead.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.260
Well, that sucks.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.100
- Humans inevitably die.
- Yeah, I know.

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.130
So how does it-? No.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.370
Maybe I don't want to know.

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.440
How does he die?

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:13.950
John Connor was terminated
on July 4th, 2032.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:18.020
I was selected for the emotional attachment
he had for my model number...

01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:22.460
...due to his boyhood experiences.
This aided in my infiltration.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:25.060
What are you saying?

01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:29.160
I killed you.

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:46.439
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100 hours,
all primary military systems were secure.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:50.680
They were. Only the civilian sector
was affected. Internet, air traffic.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.649
Minutes ago, guidance computers
at Vandenberg crashed.

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.520
We thought it was an error.
It looks like the virus.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.960
- Early warning in Alaska is down.
- Satellite signals are scrambled.

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:04.000
What about the missile silos, the subs?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.229
We've lost contact.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:11.140
You're saying this country
is completely open to attack.

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:14.140
Theoretically, we could be
under attack already.

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:19.750
Who's doing this? A foreign power
or some computer hacker in his garage?

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.050
We can't trace the virus
or pin it down.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:26.350
It keeps growing and changing,
like it has a mind of its own.

01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:28.660
This can't be happening.

01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:33.029
The Pentagon's on the secure line.
It's the chairman.

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.200
All right.

01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:54.550
Look...

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.850
...none of this is gonna happen.

01:09:57.490 --> 01:10:02.890
We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug
on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.100
He won't have to kill me someday.

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:11.200
He'll never even exist.

01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:18.210
You and I, we can
just go our separate ways.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.480
You know, Mike Kripke's basement...

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:31.190
That was the first time
I ever kissed a guy.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.720
Really?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.130
Your levity is good.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.260
It relieves tension and the fear of death.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.030
We're hoping you have a solution for us.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.970
I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready
for a system-wide connection.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.110
That's not what your civilian
counterparts there told me.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.570
They say we can stop this damn virus.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:30.240
I understand there's a certain amount
of performance anxiety...

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.750
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet
into all of our systems...

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.980
...it'll squash this thing and give me back
control of my military.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.650
Mr. Chairman, I need
to make myself very clear.

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:44.260
If we uplink now, Skynet will be
in control of your military.

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:48.460
But you'll be in control of Skynet, right?

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.930
That is correct, sir.

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.470
Then do it.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.400
And Brewster, if this thing works...

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:58.940
...you'll get all the funding
you'll ever need.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.810
Yes, sir.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.040
Sir?

01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:15.050
Shall I?

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:18.150
No.

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:21.450
It's my job now.

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.970
- Skynet Defense System activated.
- We're in.

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.380
We're past the firewalls, local
defense nets, Minutemen, subs.

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:46.680
Skynet's fully operational,
processing at 60 teraflops a second.

01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:50.720
It should take less than a minute
to find the virus and kill it.

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.690
Let's pray to God this works.

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:02.090
Power failure?

01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:04.600
No. I don't know what it is.

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:18.080
What the hell is going on?

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.270
Daddy!

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:21.380
What are you doing here?

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:30.520
Daddy! Get away from it!

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:35.860
Watch out!

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.020
Daddy, don't move.

01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:01.120
She'll be back.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.750
We have to shut down Skynet.

01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:06.560
Where's the system core?
In this building?

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:10.530
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.830
Skynet is the virus!
It's why everything's falling apart!

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.130
Skynet has become self-aware.

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:19.940
In one hour it will initiate
a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:21.200
What enemy?

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:23.210
Us!

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.710
Humans.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:37.090
Oh, God! It's the machines.
They're starting to take over.

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:40.720
My office, on this floor,
we have to get there.

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.160
The access codes are in my safe.

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:07.040
- Why are they killing everyone?
- To destroy any possible threat to Skynet.

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.980
Which ones are the codes?

01:17:09.150 --> 01:17:10.990
Red envelope.

01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:18.630
Crystal Peak. You have
to get to Crystal Peak.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.960
- What is he saying?
- Crystal Peak.

01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:23.800
A hardened facility
in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:27.740
Fifty-two miles northeast,
bearing 0.5 degrees.

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:29.600
That's the system core?

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.300
It's your only chance.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.440
You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator
leads to the runway.

01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:41.210
Take care of my daughter.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:47.020
Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:50.490
I opened Pandora's box.

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.650
Get down!

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.450
There's nothing you can do. Come on.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.740
We must go. It is not safe here.

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:16.950
Kate, we have to go.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.820
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:25.190
He wanted us to shut Skynet down.
Come on.

01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:28.400
Come on.

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.010
Run!

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.230
Let's go.

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:32.480
That's it. We can follow it
out to the runway.

01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:34.380
Come on.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.270
What?

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:35.310
Nothing.

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:38.540
You remind me of my mother.

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.370
Oh, God. She's coming.

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.810
What are you doing?

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.930
Powering up.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.240
Come on.

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:24.220
It's working.

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.420
Just die, you bitch!

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.900
Come on.

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.910
There's my father's plane.
I trained on it.

01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:09.160
Yes! He made it.

01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:13.120
Get away from me.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.620
Leave!

01:26:18.370 --> 01:26:19.500
Now!

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:21.130
Let's go!

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.170
- The master's on. Throttle's set.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:38.210
Oh, please. You can't do this.

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:40.020
I have no choice.

01:26:40.930 --> 01:26:43.290
The T-X...

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.930
...has corrupted my system.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:52.630
You can't kill a human being.
You said so yourself.

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.640
Let him go!

01:26:59.310 --> 01:27:01.110
You're fighting it right now.

01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:04.070
My CPU is intact.

01:27:04.650 --> 01:27:08.450
But I cannot control my other functions.

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:12.250
You don't have to do this.
You don't want to do this!

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.780
Desire is irrelevant.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:19.520
I am a machine.

01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:37.780
What is your mission?

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.080
To ensure the survival of John Connor...

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:45.280
...and Katherine Brewster.

01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:53.830
You are about to fail that mission!

01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:03.500
I can- I cannot.

01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:06.740
You know what you have to do.

01:28:08.710 --> 01:28:11.270
You know my destiny.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.080
I have to live.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.320
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.130
He couldn't do it.
He shut himself down.

01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:09.470
- Can you fly?
- Yeah.

01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:39.060
Okay. 015 degrees...

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.470
...52 miles, our max air speed
is about 160.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.040
We've got 32 minutes.

01:29:46.210 --> 01:29:48.040
It's just you and me now.

01:29:48.210 --> 01:29:50.680
What if we can't stop it?

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.910
There's enough C-4 here
to take out 10 supercomputers.

01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:57.690
We're gonna make it, Kate.

01:29:58.890 --> 01:30:01.260
The future is up to us.

01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.930
That's gotta be it.

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:16.160
Skynet. There may be more of them.

01:31:34.050 --> 01:31:35.850
Come on.

01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:53.260
I think this is some kind of blast door.

01:31:56.370 --> 01:31:59.040
There's no way
we can blow through this thing.

01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:01.300
John, look.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.720
Now what?

01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:10.890
It's a code prompt.

01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:21.060
Type in "Dakota 775."

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.570
"Red 176."

01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:50.930
Come on!
We gotta get this thing open.

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.030
Here. It's "Avalon 412."

01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:55.260
Put it in!

01:33:29.630 --> 01:33:31.070
Come on!

01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:49.080
I'm back.

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.660
Go! Now!

01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:08.260
Come on!

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.690
- Thank you.
- We'll meet again.

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.120
Go!

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.290
Come on!

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.400
You are terminated.

01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:56.940
The elevator.

01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:05.950
I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.890
That should give us enough time
to get back up.

01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:41.990
What is this place?

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:25.190
These computers are 30 years old.

01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:35.540
This isn't Skynet.

01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:42.050
There's nothing here.

01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:50.060
This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:54.230
Only they never got the warning.

01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.560
Goddamn it!

01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:05.400
There's nothing here!

01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:26.760
Why didn't he tell us?

01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:32.530
Why did he lead us down here?

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.940
To live.

01:38:41.110 --> 01:38:43.100
That was his mission.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.120
There was never any stopping it.

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.130
John...

01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:07.130
...we could just...

01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:09.300
...let it go.

01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:13.470
Hello?

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:16.470
Hello? Can somebody hear me?

01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:19.410
This is Montana Civil Defense.

01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:23.150
Somebody please come in.

01:39:23.650 --> 01:39:25.320
Is there anybody there?

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:28.650
Anyone reading me? Over.

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:34.090
Rumors about a launch sequence.
Command and control have broken down.

01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:38.430
Is anyone receiving me?
Somebody?

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:42.500
Somebody please come in.

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:44.270
Anybody out there?

01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:47.840
- This is SAC Nellis. We're under attack.
- CQ? CQ?

01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:49.670
Is anybody there?

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.350
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

01:39:56.290 --> 01:40:01.020
Connor? What the hell is happening?
Who's in charge there?

01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:09.200
I am.

01:40:10.530 --> 01:40:12.870
Connor, can you help us?

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:18.040
This is Montana Civil Defense.
Where did you say you were again?

01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:24.210
By the time Skynet
became self-aware...

01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:28.880
...it had spread into millions
of computer servers across the planet.

01:40:29.650 --> 01:40:34.560
Ordinary computers in office buildings,
dorm rooms, everywhere.

01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:40.060
It was software and cyberspace.

01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:46.070
There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:52.400
The attack began at 6:18 p. m.,
just as he said it would.

01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:55.070
Judgment Day.

01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:58.440
The day the human race
was nearly destroyed...

01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:01.350
...by weapons they'd built
to protect themselves.

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.920
I should have realized our destiny
was never to stop Judgment Day.

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:12.420
It was merely to survive it...

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.220
...together.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.430
The Terminator knew.

01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:23.430
He tried to tell us...

01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:26.970
...but I didn't want to hear it.

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:33.270
Maybe the future has been written.
I don't know.

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.950
All I know is what
the Terminator taught me:

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.950
Never stop fighting.

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.790
And I never will.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.750
The battle has just begun.

01:41:49.305 --> 01:41:55.862
