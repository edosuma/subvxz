<i>She was a biochemist and</i>
<i>a commander of the Red 2 Mars Project,</i>

04:12.877 --> 04:16.756

04:29.227 --> 04:30.853
<i>Judy was the only scientist.</i>

04:30.937 --> 04:32.355
<i>The other five were just civilians</i>

<i>who paid buttloads</i>
<i>for a spot on the Red Planet.</i>

04:35.149 --> 04:39.737
<i>I mean, Brody himself is going</i>
<i>to take them to be the first Mars colony.</i>

04:39.821 --> 04:42.073
<i>I mean, that is</i>
<i>if tests go according to plan.</i>

<i>-There's an apple...</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

04:47.954 --> 04:51.249
<i>...and this hair, which was stuck</i>
<i>in that bloody footprint.</i>

04:51.332 --> 04:53.876
<i>I checked everyone's suits</i>
<i>but couldn't find any blood.</i>

04:53.960 --> 04:55.295
<i>The killer must have cleaned it,</i>

04:55.378 --> 04:57.755
<i>because, since no one's allowed</i>
<i>in or out of the dome,</i>

04:57.839 --> 04:59.090

05:03.177 --> 05:04.387
<i>Huh. All right.</i>

05:04.470 --> 05:06.597
<i>And the cameras,</i>
<i>did they capture anything?</i>

05:06.681 --> 05:09.225
<i>Yeah, but most of the footage</i>
<i>has already been wiped.</i>

05:09.934 --> 05:10.893
<i>Okay.</i>

05:10.977 --> 05:14.272
<i>Well, I got to talk to the crew,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna head back to the precinct.</i>

<i>and there's nowhere I'd rather be, so--</i>

<i>I can't believe you left</i>
<i>and didn't even say goodbye!</i>

<i>-Bloody hell.</i>
<i>-You just ran off to Florida</i>

05:28.369 --> 05:29.412
<i>and forgot about us.</i>

<i>Florida? I--</i>

05:32.957 --> 05:35.918
<i>Oh, yes. Yes, I was in Florida.</i>

05:36.002 --> 05:37.295

<i>You said you had to take over </i>
<i>the family business.</i>

05:39.505 --> 05:42.300
<i>Indeed. My mother was ill, which is why</i>
<i>I had to take over the business.</i>

05:42.842 --> 05:46.971
<i>But Florida is wretched.</i>
<i>Far too many creepy-crawlies,</i>

05:47.055 --> 05:48.765
<i>and no Miss Lopez.</i>

<i>Can I...</i>

06:09.077 --> 06:09.911
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:12.663 --> 06:13.748
<i>You just lied to her.</i>

06:14.374 --> 06:15.833
<i>Uh, no. You did.</i>

06:15.917 --> 06:17.001
<i>I just kept up the ruse.</i>

06:17.085 --> 06:18.336
<i>You never lie.</i>

06:19.295 --> 06:22.590
<i>Remember, Detective,</i>
<i>for you, I was only gone for two months.</i>

06:22.673 --> 06:25.760
<i>But for me, I was in Hell</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

06:25.843 --> 06:28.513
<i>A few things might have changed,</i>
<i>maybe even improved.</i>

06:28.596 --> 06:31.974
<i>After all, a little white lie</i>
<i>could be quite beneficial.</i>

06:34.185 --> 06:35.019
<i>[Dan] Oh.</i>

<i>-Hey.</i>

06:55.832 --> 06:56.749
<i>Uh, no.</i>

<i>No, it's amethyst.</i>

07:21.232 --> 07:23.401
<i>Lucifer's back? What?</i>

07:23.484 --> 07:25.695
<i>Yes! Yes, it's--it's amazing.</i>

07:25.820 --> 07:26.737
<i>I... I am...</i>

07:26.821 --> 07:28.656
<i>I am happy. [forced laugh]</i>

07:28.739 --> 07:30.533
<i>I'm ecstatic. [chuckles]</i>

07:31.284 --> 07:33.119
<i>And we're sitting.</i>

07:33.494 --> 07:34.370
<i>What's wrong?</i>

07:34.745 --> 07:35.705
<i>Uh...</i>

07:35.788 --> 07:39.792
<i>Well, it's--it's probably nothing,</i>
<i>but Lucifer's acting...</i>

07:40.668 --> 07:42.211
<i>um, different.</i>

07:42.295 --> 07:43.379
<i>Different how?</i>

07:43.463 --> 07:44.338
<i>I don't know.</i>

07:44.422 --> 07:47.758
<i>I'm sure it has nothing to do</i>
<i>with the fact that I told him I loved him</i>

07:47.842 --> 07:51.304
<i>right before he left,</i>
<i>and he didn't exactly say it back.</i>

07:51.387 --> 07:52.972
<i>But he did say...</i>

07:53.556 --> 07:54.432
<i>[sighs]</i>

07:54.640 --> 07:56.809
<i>"It was you, Chloe.</i>

07:56.893 --> 07:58.060
<i>It was always you,"</i>

07:58.144 --> 08:01.564
<i>which is kind of a big deal</i>
<i>because he used my name,</i>

08:01.647 --> 08:02.982
<i>which is something he never does.</i>

08:03.065 --> 08:07.069
<i>So I'm pretty sure he's not acting weird</i>
<i>because I freaked him out or anything.</i>

08:07.987 --> 08:10.072
<i>Well... I think</i>

08:11.032 --> 08:13.326
<i>if Lucifer's been acting unusually,</i>

08:13.409 --> 08:16.496
<i>it's probably because he's been in,</i>
<i>well, you know...</i>

08:17.330 --> 08:18.164
<i>Hell.</i>

08:18.247 --> 08:19.624
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Although it may have been</i>

08:19.707 --> 08:21.334
<i>a couple of months for us...</i>

08:22.335 --> 08:25.004
<i>he's told me that</i>
<i>time's not the same there,</i>

08:25.087 --> 08:28.466
<i>so it might have been</i>
<i>thousands of years for him.</i>

08:28.549 --> 08:31.135
<i>Yes. He, um... He told me that, too.</i>

08:31.802 --> 08:32.637
<i>Um...</i>

08:33.012 --> 08:34.013
<i>Unless he's lying.</i>

08:34.096 --> 08:34.931
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

08:35.014 --> 08:36.224
<i>At least we know that</i>

08:36.307 --> 08:38.518
<i>that's something he never does, right?</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

08:38.976 --> 08:40.061
<i>Uh...</i>

08:41.395 --> 08:42.230
<i>Right?</i>

08:42.730 --> 08:45.358
<i>Well, actually, this morning, um,</i>

08:45.441 --> 08:51.113
<i>I found out that Lucifer has</i>
<i>reconsidered his position on honesty.</i>

08:51.197 --> 08:52.073
<i>[chuckles]</i>

08:53.616 --> 08:54.450
<i>Oh.</i>

08:56.244 --> 08:57.245
<i>Interesting.</i>

08:58.538 --> 09:01.207
<i>Well, I'm sure whatever</i>
<i>Lucifer is going through,</i>

09:01.290 --> 09:05.086
<i>it has nothing to do with you</i>
<i>or his feelings for you.</i>

09:06.045 --> 09:08.381
<i>He probably just needs time</i>
<i>to reacclimate.</i>

09:08.464 --> 09:10.550
<i>You know, remember...</i>

09:11.676 --> 09:13.803
<i>what his life is like here.</i>

09:14.262 --> 09:15.096
<i>Right.</i>

09:15.763 --> 09:18.224
<i>Yes. Yeah. Yes, that...</i>

09:18.558 --> 09:19.684
<i>You're so right, that's it.</i>

09:19.767 --> 09:21.978
<i>I just have to, to remind him</i>

09:22.061 --> 09:24.188
<i>of who he was when he was on Earth,</i>

09:24.272 --> 09:25.773
<i>and then give him a little jump start.</i>

09:25.856 --> 09:28.025
<i>That's exactly it. Thank you, Linda.</i>

09:28.109 --> 09:29.110
<i>You're a genius.</i>

09:30.736 --> 09:32.405
<i>You two are perfect for each other.</i>

09:32.488 --> 09:33.406
<i>[chuckles]</i>

09:33.990 --> 09:34.824
<i>Maybe.</i>

09:36.200 --> 09:38.286
<i>So there's five</i>
<i>Red 2 Mars Project members.</i>

09:38.369 --> 09:40.746
<i>We just have to figure out</i>
<i>which one had motive to kill Judy.</i>

09:40.830 --> 09:42.623
<i>Yes, interrogation. I remember it well.</i>

09:42.707 --> 09:44.417
<i>Crucial to the crime-solving process.</i>

09:44.500 --> 09:46.544
<i>Well, and it can be boring,</i>
<i>but you'll make it fun.</i>

09:46.627 --> 09:48.170
<i>You always do. That's who you are.</i>

09:48.504 --> 09:51.716
<i>Right, let's get down to serious business,</i>
<i>shall we?</i>

09:52.717 --> 09:53.634
<i>You, uh...</i>

09:54.135 --> 09:55.261
<i>You hated Judy, didn't you?</i>

09:55.678 --> 09:57.930
<i>Well, I didn't exactly love the woman.</i>

09:58.014 --> 10:00.725
<i>Fact is, Judy was a piggy little thief,</i>

10:00.808 --> 10:02.643
<i>always stealing our food rations.</i>

10:02.727 --> 10:03.769
<i>Well... [chuckles]</i>

10:03.853 --> 10:06.355
<i>...the stomach wants</i>
<i>what the stomach wants, am I right?</i>

10:06.439 --> 10:09.150
<i>I mean, we all have desires, right?</i>

10:10.443 --> 10:12.528
<i>I wonder what... what she desires.</i>

10:13.529 --> 10:15.865
<i>Well, probably just to eat her own food.</i>
<i>She just said it.</i>

10:16.449 --> 10:19.035
<i>Did Judy do anything else</i>
<i>that you found aggravating?</i>

10:19.118 --> 10:20.870
<i>Yeah, actually.</i>

10:20.953 --> 10:24.040
<i>She totally bugged out</i>
<i>when I microdosed this one day.</i>

10:24.498 --> 10:28.377
<i>I mean, I'm going to want to trip</i>
<i>when I take my trip, right?</i>

10:28.461 --> 10:29.503
<i>That reminds me.</i>

10:30.254 --> 10:33.174
<i>You left this at my desk.</i>

10:33.591 --> 10:35.468
<i>-Detective!</i>
<i>-[mouthing] You want?</i>

10:35.551 --> 10:37.094
<i>It's not even noon.</i>

10:38.721 --> 10:42.391
<i>Yes, I can see how that behavior</i>
<i>might grate on one's nerves.</i>

10:42.475 --> 10:44.852
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>
<i>She never really bothered me.</i>

10:44.935 --> 10:47.021
<i>She was a bit loud</i>
<i>on the sat phone sometimes.</i>

10:47.104 --> 10:48.606
<i>Other than that, nice lady.</i>

10:48.689 --> 10:49.774
<i>You're lying!</i>

10:50.900 --> 10:52.526
<i>Mm. No,</i>

10:52.610 --> 10:53.736
<i>I'm not.</i>

10:54.403 --> 10:56.405
<i>[whispering] </i>
<i>I'm sorry, did you want to do that?</i>

10:56.489 --> 10:57.323
<i>No.</i>

10:58.032 --> 10:59.784
<i>There must be something</i>
<i>you're not telling us.</i>

10:59.867 --> 11:01.369
<i>[woman] Not to speak ill of the dead,</i>

11:01.452 --> 11:04.288
<i>but Judy was a bit of a party pooper.</i>

11:04.872 --> 11:08.918
<i>We had about five books</i>
<i>the entire time we were in there,</i>

11:09.001 --> 11:11.879
<i>and she managed to spoil</i>
<i>the endings to all of them.</i>

11:12.463 --> 11:14.548
<i>Yeah? What'd you do,</i>
<i>bite the head off a bat?</i>

11:14.632 --> 11:16.842
<i>Stab her in her sorry space ass?</i>

11:16.926 --> 11:18.386
<i>Huh, Sharon?</i>

11:18.469 --> 11:22.264
<i>Actually, that was my husband</i>
<i>that bit the head of a bat.</i>

11:22.348 --> 11:24.475
<i>Oh, come on! You're lying.</i>

11:24.558 --> 11:27.645
<i>I apologize for my partner.</i>
<i>That was very unprofessional.</i>

11:27.728 --> 11:28.688
<i>It's quite all right.</i>

11:28.771 --> 11:33.359
<i>By the way, I never managed to thank you</i>
<i>for all the things you did for Ozzy.</i>

11:33.442 --> 11:36.737
<i>From one Prince of Darkness</i>
<i>to another, right? [laughs]</i>

11:36.821 --> 11:38.406
<i>Yes. Well done.</i>

11:38.489 --> 11:41.409
<i>So other than the books, you liked Judy?</i>

11:41.492 --> 11:42.785
<i>Yeah. Totally.</i>

11:42.868 --> 11:44.954
<i>Everybody did, especially the guys.</i>

11:45.037 --> 11:45.913
<i>-Oh.</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

11:45.996 --> 11:48.290
<i>I mean, she was so hot,</i>
<i>and smart, of course.</i>

11:48.916 --> 11:51.335
<i>But she's not the only one</i>
<i>who knew about science.</i>

11:51.419 --> 11:53.921
<i>Did you know that I engineered</i>
<i>five of my fragrances myself?</i>

11:54.004 --> 11:56.048
<i>The fruit scents</i>
<i>are slightly controversial,</i>

11:56.132 --> 11:58.551
<i>but everyone loved my melons. [laughs]</i>

11:58.634 --> 11:59.802
<i>[Chloe] Mm-hmm.</i>

11:59.885 --> 12:00.928
<i>[laughs]</i>

12:01.011 --> 12:02.388
<i>Oh-- Really?</i>

12:02.763 --> 12:03.931
<i>Nothing?</i>

12:04.014 --> 12:05.474
<i>At least hit on her.</i>

12:05.558 --> 12:06.517
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

12:06.600 --> 12:09.145
<i>-She might be a murderer.</i>
<i>-Wait. I didn't kill Judy.</i>

12:09.228 --> 12:10.646
<i>I'd never hurt Judy.</i>

12:10.730 --> 12:13.733
<i>-I am certainly not a murderer.</i>
-<i>Dude, I didn't kill her.</i>

12:14.859 --> 12:15.901
<i>Is this cinnamon?</i>

12:15.985 --> 12:21.615
<i>No, I did not stab her</i>
<i>in her "sorry space ass."</i>

12:21.699 --> 12:23.325
<i>[groans] Dearie me!</i>

12:24.618 --> 12:25.953
<i>That got us nowhere.</i>

12:26.328 --> 12:28.289
<i>Yeah, tell me about it.</i>

12:29.832 --> 12:31.876
<i>Hey, what's going on with you?</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

12:33.586 --> 12:35.629
<i>Of course. Everything's fine.</i>

12:35.713 --> 12:37.715
<i>Don't you want to do something impulsive,</i>

12:37.798 --> 12:40.259
<i>inappropriate, sinful, you know?</i>

12:41.135 --> 12:42.386
<i>Like... What-- [grunts]</i>

12:43.971 --> 12:45.181
<i>Here, eat this.</i>

12:45.765 --> 12:47.099
<i>Well, I'm not really hungry.</i>

12:47.183 --> 12:48.601
<i>That's not why you eat it.</i>

12:48.684 --> 12:49.602
<i>-Looks like--</i>
<i>-Hey.</i>

12:49.685 --> 12:50.519
<i>Hi.</i>

12:51.353 --> 12:53.481
<i>Hey, is that my pudding?</i>

12:53.564 --> 12:55.775
<i>Yes! Yes, here you go, Daniel. Yummy.</i>

12:57.777 --> 12:58.611
<i>Okay.</i>

12:59.945 --> 13:01.238
<i>[sniffs] What's your game?</i>

13:01.322 --> 13:03.616
<i>Nothing, just thought</i>
<i>you looked a bit peckish.</i>

13:03.699 --> 13:04.575
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

13:05.618 --> 13:06.577
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

13:09.872 --> 13:10.790
<i>Did you spit in it?</i>

13:11.707 --> 13:12.625
<i>He spit in it.</i>

13:13.459 --> 13:14.668
<i>Got something, kids.</i>

13:14.752 --> 13:16.712
<i>That hair I found</i>
<i>in the bloody boot print,</i>

13:16.796 --> 13:17.922
<i>it's sheep hair.</i>

13:18.005 --> 13:20.883
<i>Now, unless someone</i>
<i>was into some freaky stuff...</i>

13:20.966 --> 13:21.884
<i>Don't even say it.</i>

13:22.384 --> 13:23.344
<i>I won't.</i>

13:23.427 --> 13:28.224
<i>It means that someone tracked that hair in</i>
<i>from outside the dome.</i>

13:28.307 --> 13:30.601
<i>Oh, well, that is exciting!</i>

13:30.684 --> 13:32.603
<i>Well done, Miss Lopez.</i>

13:32.853 --> 13:35.689
<i>Right, I'd say it's time to go and talk</i>
<i>to the people running the program.</i>

13:36.190 --> 13:37.274
<i>Genius!</i>

13:37.358 --> 13:40.444
<i>Oh, God, it's so great to have Lucifer</i>
<i>back again, isn't it?</i>

13:40.528 --> 13:41.570
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

13:43.906 --> 13:45.658
<i>[Lucifer] So we understand </i>
<i>no one was allowed</i>

13:45.741 --> 13:46.909
<i>in or out of the facility,</i>

13:46.992 --> 13:49.745
<i>but people must have come to the dome</i>
<i>to drop off supplies, yes?</i>

13:49.829 --> 13:50.704
<i>Uh, no, actually.</i>

13:50.788 --> 13:52.790
<i>The whole point is</i>
<i>to simulate a real trip to Mars,</i>

13:52.873 --> 13:56.544
<i>so no one's going to swing by when you're</i>
<i>just, you know, 33 million miles away.</i>

13:56.627 --> 13:58.045
<i>And what about repairs?</i>

13:58.128 --> 14:01.590
<i>Again, all maintenance has to be done</i>
<i>on site, although that's minimal, too.</i>

14:01.674 --> 14:04.677
<i>We've made a lot of improvements</i>
<i>from the first project to Red 2.</i>

14:04.760 --> 14:06.428
<i>We're less concerned</i>
<i>about equipment failure</i>

14:06.512 --> 14:08.055
<i>than we are of people breaking down.</i>

14:08.138 --> 14:09.139
<i>And what does that mean?</i>

14:09.223 --> 14:12.101
<i>One of the main reasons</i>
<i>why we're running these simulations</i>

14:12.184 --> 14:14.603
<i>is to test the psychological strength</i>
<i>of our travelers.</i>

14:14.937 --> 14:18.691
<i>It's difficult to be isolated</i>
<i>with strangers for so long,</i>

14:18.774 --> 14:21.402
<i>away from your family, friends,</i>
<i>everyone you love.</i>

14:21.861 --> 14:24.029
<i>Yeah. I participated</i>
<i>in the Red 1 Mars Project.</i>

14:24.113 --> 14:26.490
<i>I can tell you firsthand,</i>
<i>the experience really...</i>

14:27.616 --> 14:28.492
<i>changes a person.</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:30.494
<i>But once you were back for a while,</i>

14:30.578 --> 14:33.038
<i>did you start to feel</i>
<i>more like yourself, or...</i>

14:34.039 --> 14:37.126
<i>To tell you the truth, I'm not sure.</i>
<i>I'm not sure if I'll ever be the same.</i>

14:37.710 --> 14:40.504
<i>Well, it must have been particularly hard</i>
<i>on your relationships.</i>

14:43.299 --> 14:44.133
<i>Detective,</i>

14:44.884 --> 14:49.013
<i>didn't one of the crew members mention</i>
<i>that Judy was loud on the phone?</i>

14:49.096 --> 14:50.890
<i>Perhaps she was arguing with someone</i>
<i>back home.</i>

14:50.973 --> 14:51.807
<i>[woman] Doubtful.</i>

14:51.891 --> 14:54.560
<i>The sat phones are just used</i>
<i>for project communications.</i>

14:54.643 --> 14:56.770
<i>They're only connected to the system here.</i>

14:56.854 --> 14:59.106
<i>Well, did anyone here</i>
<i>have issues with Judy, then?</i>

14:59.189 --> 15:01.567
<i>[sighs] What about Donovan?</i>

15:02.401 --> 15:03.527
<i>-Who?</i>
<i>-An aerospace engineer</i>

15:03.611 --> 15:04.945
<i>who used to work here.</i>

15:05.029 --> 15:07.948
<i>But when Judy got promoted</i>
<i>to project commander of Red 2 over him,</i>

15:08.032 --> 15:08.866
<i>he got pissed.</i>

15:08.949 --> 15:11.619
<i>He went to Brody, he threw a fit,</i>
<i>so Brody fired him.</i>

15:11.702 --> 15:12.786
<i>Donovan was kind of...</i>

15:13.579 --> 15:15.205
<i>-emotional when he left.</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

15:15.664 --> 15:16.957
<i>-Oh, was he?</i>
<i>-[Chloe] Huh.</i>

15:17.791 --> 15:18.709
<i>Okay.</i>

15:19.501 --> 15:20.461
<i>[Lucifer sighs]</i>

15:22.671 --> 15:23.589
<i>Detective, I...</i>

15:24.256 --> 15:27.593
<i>I could tell the questions you were asking</i>
<i>certainly weren't just about the case.</i>

15:29.053 --> 15:31.347
<i>You're concerned that I have changed.</i>

15:31.847 --> 15:33.265
<i>Well, the truth is...</i>

15:34.558 --> 15:35.392
<i>I have.</i>

15:38.020 --> 15:40.481
<i>But I need you to know</i>
<i>that my feelings for you...</i>

15:42.650 --> 15:43.484
<i>haven't.</i>

15:44.610 --> 15:45.653
<i>[Chloe sighs]</i>

15:46.236 --> 15:47.655
<i>You've already been so patient.</i>

15:47.738 --> 15:49.907
<i>I just ask that you give me</i>
<i>a little more time.</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:52.534
<i>Of course.</i>

15:52.952 --> 15:53.994
<i>Whatever you need.</i>

15:55.537 --> 15:57.414
<i>[sighs] Thank you.</i>

16:09.510 --> 16:10.594
<i>[elevator dings]</i>

16:56.140 --> 16:57.141
<i>[distorted chiming]</i>

<i>[Lucifer grunting]</i>

17:04.273 --> 17:05.899
<i>[choking]</i>

17:05.983 --> 17:06.942
<i>How could you?</i>

17:07.526 --> 17:10.112
<i>After everything</i>
<i>we've been through, Lucifer,</i>

17:10.195 --> 17:11.613
<i>how could you go home without me?</i>

17:11.697 --> 17:14.116
<i>[in American accent]</i>
<i>I'm not Lucifer! I'm not Lucifer!</i>

17:14.199 --> 17:17.453
<i>I'm not Lucifer! [grunting]</i>

17:17.536 --> 17:19.121
<i>[gasping]</i>

17:24.126 --> 17:25.002
<i>[panting]</i>

17:25.085 --> 17:27.212
<i>Lucifer told me he had a twin brother.</i>

17:28.547 --> 17:31.133
<i>And you are Mazikeen.</i>

17:34.303 --> 17:35.596
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

17:37.222 --> 17:38.098
<i>I'm Michael.</i>

17:43.353 --> 17:44.188
<i>"Michael," huh?</i>

17:45.147 --> 17:47.316
<i>How do I know you're not Lucifer</i>
<i>saying you're Michael</i>

17:47.399 --> 17:49.151
<i>just so I won't kick your ass?</i>

17:49.902 --> 17:51.695
<i>Lucifer doesn't lie, remember?</i>

17:56.033 --> 17:56.950
<i>[chuckles]</i>

18:07.252 --> 18:09.421
<i>Do these look like Lucifer's wings to you?</i>

18:14.384 --> 18:16.220
<i>Fine. What the hell are you doing here?</i>

18:18.055 --> 18:21.725
<i>To right a very serious wrong.</i>

18:21.809 --> 18:25.771
<i>See, there I am in the Silver City,</i>
<i>doing my thing,</i>

18:25.854 --> 18:28.732
<i>when Gabriel strolls in and says,</i>

18:29.066 --> 18:30.692
<i>"Lucifer went back to Hell,</i>

18:30.776 --> 18:31.944
<i>voluntarily."</i>

18:32.611 --> 18:35.739
<i>Well, I just crack up,</i>
<i>as you can imagine, but...</i>

18:36.323 --> 18:40.244
<i>then Raphael starts going off</i>
<i>about how Lucifer's grown, </i>

18:40.327 --> 18:43.205
<i>and then Remy says,</i>
<i>"Yeah, what a sacrifice,"</i>

18:43.288 --> 18:47.417
<i>and then pretty soon all I hear is,</i>
<i>"Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer!"</i>

18:48.418 --> 18:49.837
<i>So you're jealous?</i>

18:50.587 --> 18:51.421
<i>No.</i>

18:53.173 --> 18:54.133
<i>I'm pissed.</i>

18:54.216 --> 18:57.261
<i>Lucifer finally does</i>
<i>what he's supposed to do</i>

18:57.344 --> 18:59.555
<i>without whining about it,</i>
<i>and he gets praised?</i>

18:59.930 --> 19:02.224
<i>He rebelled against Dad.</i>

19:02.307 --> 19:04.476
<i>Almighty God, for God's sake.</i>

19:04.768 --> 19:07.521
<i>Since when do we congratulate a convict</i>
<i>for serving a sentence?</i>

19:08.438 --> 19:12.234
<i>And if I know my eternally</i>
<i>selfish brother, and I do,</i>

19:12.317 --> 19:16.530
<i>all this sacrifice and responsibility</i>
<i>bullshit, it's just smoke and mirrors.</i>

19:16.613 --> 19:19.658
<i>I don't know who he's trying to fool,</i>
<i>but I do know...</i>

19:20.033 --> 19:24.371
<i>that as soon as he hears someone is</i>
<i>up here playing with his toys...</i>

19:25.122 --> 19:27.749
<i>maybe even breaking a few,</i>

19:28.417 --> 19:32.296
<i>then he will come flying right back up</i>
<i>to reveal his true colors.</i>

19:32.796 --> 19:33.714
<i>So...</i>

19:33.797 --> 19:36.049
<i>[sighs deeply]</i>

19:36.383 --> 19:38.969
<i>[in English accent] Hello, Los Angeles.</i>

19:41.555 --> 19:44.224
<i>Seems to me you're the only one</i>
<i>trying to fool people.</i>

19:44.641 --> 19:45.642
<i>Good luck with that.</i>

19:46.143 --> 19:47.769
<i>Humans are smart.</i>

<i>Especially Chloe Decker.</i>

<i>[in American accent]</i>
<i>I admit, she was getting</i>

19:52.566 --> 19:54.193
<i>a little suspicious, but...</i>

19:54.860 --> 19:57.946
<i>I'll just up my Lucifer game</i>
<i>until she's properly hooked,</i>

19:58.030 --> 20:01.533
<i>and then I will achy-break</i>
<i>her little heart.</i>

20:02.534 --> 20:05.704
<i>Do you even know how to be Lucifer?</i>

20:06.246 --> 20:08.624
<i>Know anything about Earth? Humans?</i>

20:09.208 --> 20:11.501
<i>I pay attention, Miss Mazikeen.</i>

20:12.419 --> 20:14.213
<i>I know a lot of things.</i>

20:14.296 --> 20:17.883
<i>And what makes you think I will let you</i>
<i>get away with any of this?</i>

20:17.966 --> 20:19.426
<i>Well, why wouldn't you?</i>

20:21.345 --> 20:23.889
<i>Why wouldn't you even help me?</i>

20:25.140 --> 20:25.974
<i>Hmm?</i>

20:27.476 --> 20:29.853
<i>I told you, I know things,</i>

20:30.145 --> 20:33.732
<i>and I know that you're pissed</i>
<i>at my brother.</i>

20:35.275 --> 20:36.318
<i>Join me.</i>

20:36.944 --> 20:41.240
<i>Lure him back up here, and then</i>
<i>you can kick the real Lucifer's ass.</i>

20:43.575 --> 20:46.119
<i>Or you could just keep beating up pianos.</i>

20:46.787 --> 20:47.871
<i>It's your choice.</i>

<i>Yes. Yes, I got a bit bored,</i>
<i>so I thought I'd pop back up.</i>

<i>Anyway, I'll see you later.</i>

21:17.359 --> 21:18.610
<i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute!</i>

21:18.694 --> 21:21.571
<i>I'm going to need just a little bit more</i>
<i>information than that, brother.</i>

<i>I left them a cheese plate</i>
<i>and put on some cartoons.</i>

21:32.249 --> 21:33.583
<i>You're being awfully glib.</i>

21:33.667 --> 21:35.544
<i>I'm always glib, brother.</i>

21:38.380 --> 21:41.258
<i>Look, I know what this is about.</i>

21:41.341 --> 21:43.593
<i>You're afraid for baby Charlie, right?</i>

21:45.804 --> 21:47.472
<i>Yes, Lucy, of course I am.</i>

21:47.556 --> 21:50.309
<i>What's to stop more demons from coming up</i>
<i>and taking my son again?</i>

21:50.392 --> 21:52.728
<i>I went back to Hell for a reason.</i>

21:52.811 --> 21:55.022
<i>I was concerned, too, but I'm not anymore.</i>

21:55.897 --> 21:57.441
<i>Everyone's in line, trust me.</i>

22:08.952 --> 22:14.166
<i>All right, so, DMV lists this</i>
<i>as Donovan Glover's most recent address.</i>

22:14.249 --> 22:16.543
<i>If he goes to Mars,</i>
<i>they're never going to find Waldo. </i>

22:16.668 --> 22:19.463
<i>[both laughing]</i>

22:20.422 --> 22:23.425
<i>You know, you seem more like</i>
<i>your regular self tonight.</i>

22:24.301 --> 22:25.761
<i>-Do I?</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

22:32.601 --> 22:33.852
<i>Donovan Glover?</i>

22:37.856 --> 22:38.815
<i>[Chloe] LAPD!</i>

22:38.899 --> 22:40.400
<i>Oh. [grunts]</i>

22:40.484 --> 22:42.069
<i>I don't believe he heard you.</i>

22:44.154 --> 22:45.781
<i>[tires squealing]</i>

22:51.161 --> 22:52.204
<i>He's headed for the bridge.</i>

22:52.287 --> 22:54.039
<i>-But if you head west--</i>
<i>-We can cut him off.</i>

22:54.122 --> 22:55.248
<i>You read my mind.</i>

22:55.624 --> 22:57.209
<i>[tires squealing]</i>

23:03.840 --> 23:05.175
<i>Well done, Detective.</i>

23:30.867 --> 23:31.910
<i>[brakes squeal]</i>

23:32.619 --> 23:33.787
<i>Oh!</i>

23:34.287 --> 23:35.163
<i>Come on.</i>

23:38.041 --> 23:39.126
<i>Oh! [grunts]</i>

23:47.426 --> 23:49.261
<i>LAPD! Get out of the car!</i>

23:50.846 --> 23:52.180
<i>[engine revs]</i>

23:55.517 --> 23:57.227
<i>[tires squeal]</i>

<i>-[gun firing]</i>
<i>-[Donovan grunts]</i>

24:22.043 --> 24:23.253
<i>[gasps]</i>

24:23.962 --> 24:24.838
<i>Well!</i>

24:25.422 --> 24:27.257
<i>That was fun. [chuckles]</i>

24:28.175 --> 24:29.509
<i>[sighs]</i>

24:29.926 --> 24:31.011
<i>[chuckles]</i>

24:32.345 --> 24:34.014
<i>[Donovan] I thought you were repo men.</i>

24:34.431 --> 24:35.599
<i>And woman.</i>

24:35.932 --> 24:37.017
<i>Sorry I freaked.</i>

24:37.100 --> 24:39.019
<i>It's just, that car is all I got left.</i>

24:39.102 --> 24:41.521
<i>Well, perhaps you shouldn't have</i>
<i>freaked on your boss Brody</i>

24:41.605 --> 24:42.689
<i>and gotten yourself fired.</i>

24:42.772 --> 24:43.857
<i>Oh, you know about that?</i>

24:43.940 --> 24:45.317
<i>Well, he kind of deserved it.</i>

24:45.400 --> 24:47.861
<i>He gave a promotion to someone</i>
<i>way less qualified than me.</i>

24:47.944 --> 24:49.237
<i>You're referring to poor Judy.</i>

24:49.321 --> 24:51.031
<i>[Chloe] The woman you stabbed in the neck.</i>

24:51.615 --> 24:54.409
<i>Wait, are you saying Judy's dead?</i>

24:54.493 --> 24:55.827
<i>Very.</i>

24:56.328 --> 24:57.579
<i>And you think I did it?</i>

24:58.955 --> 25:00.624
<i>No. No way.</i>

25:00.832 --> 25:03.043
<i>First of all, I've been in Texas</i>
<i>all week, interviewing.</i>

25:03.126 --> 25:04.419
<i>Just got back last night.</i>

25:04.503 --> 25:06.755
<i>Second, I never touched that woman.</i>

25:06.838 --> 25:08.840
<i>Bad enough Brody blacklisted me.</i>

25:08.924 --> 25:10.967
<i>Who knows what he'd do</i>
<i>if anyone hurt his Judy?</i>

25:11.051 --> 25:12.052
<i>"His" Judy?</i>

25:12.135 --> 25:12.969
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:13.512 --> 25:14.888
<i>They were having an affair.</i>

25:14.971 --> 25:16.765
<i>Why do you think she got the job over me?</i>

25:17.057 --> 25:20.227
<i>Boss can't even follow his own</i>
<i>"No fraternizing at work" rule.</i>

25:22.312 --> 25:23.396
<i>Brody's married.</i>

25:23.480 --> 25:25.190
<i>Perhaps Judy got tired</i>
<i>of being the mistress.</i>

25:25.273 --> 25:26.525
<i>Explains the angry phone calls.</i>

25:26.608 --> 25:28.276
<i>Brody got scared his wife would find out.</i>

25:28.360 --> 25:31.571
<i>Yeah, made sure she wouldn't.</i>
<i>He has access to Mission Control.</i>

25:31.655 --> 25:34.324
<i>And the ability to delete</i>
<i>the surveillance footage.</i>

25:34.407 --> 25:36.743
<i>Yes. We have to go talk to Brody.</i>

25:37.327 --> 25:38.453
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

25:39.496 --> 25:40.372
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:40.830 --> 25:43.458
<i>And, uh, you're never gonna be </i>
<i>Ryan Gosling, by the way.</i>

25:50.549 --> 25:51.383
<i>Hey.</i>

25:53.260 --> 25:54.094
<i>What are you doing?</i>

25:54.678 --> 25:56.721
<i>I'm literally doing nothing.</i>

25:58.348 --> 25:59.349
<i>You never do nothing.</i>

25:59.849 --> 26:01.643
<i>Something is definitely up.</i>

26:02.310 --> 26:05.146
<i>Hi. So I figured out</i>
<i>why we can't get a hold of Brody.</i>

26:05.230 --> 26:06.064
<i>He's dead?</i>

26:06.898 --> 26:08.817
<i>-Not Heaven. Space.</i>
<i>-Ah.</i>

26:08.900 --> 26:11.945
<i>Turns out he's on a suborbital</i>
<i>shuttle test until tomorrow morning.</i>

26:12.028 --> 26:14.072
<i>So, you know...</i>

26:14.906 --> 26:16.533
<i>That means that you and I...</i>

26:17.617 --> 26:19.286
<i>have the rest of the evening free.</i>

26:22.539 --> 26:23.415
<i>Right.</i>

26:23.498 --> 26:27.294
<i>Right, well, I suppose I'll go home</i>
<i>and get some dinner, then.</i>

26:27.544 --> 26:29.004
<i>All on my lonesome.</i>

26:30.463 --> 26:31.881
<i>I'll see you later, Detective.</i>

26:33.466 --> 26:34.426
<i>Ah.</i>

26:34.509 --> 26:36.720
<i>Um... was that an invitation?</i>

26:37.846 --> 26:38.805
<i>Don't ask me.</i>

26:40.015 --> 26:41.474
<i>The guy's a freaking enigma.</i>

26:42.475 --> 26:43.518
<i>Mm.</i>

26:50.233 --> 26:51.109
<i>[elevator dings]</i>

<i>Detective.</i>

<i>Detective! Wait!</i>

<i>Detective, please.</i>

<i>Detective...</i>

<i>Please! Please.</i>

<i>-Let me explain.</i>
<i>-Maze?</i>

27:26.061 --> 27:26.895
<i>Maze?</i>

27:27.479 --> 27:29.689
<i>You are acting so different.</i>

27:29.773 --> 27:32.067
<i>I am trying to be patient, Lucifer.</i>

27:32.150 --> 27:33.943
<i>-Understanding, but no...</i>
<i>-Detective...</i>

27:35.195 --> 27:37.238
<i>No. Leave me alone. I...</i>

27:38.198 --> 27:40.116
<i>I don't even know who you are anymore.</i>

27:42.285 --> 27:43.203
<i>You're right.</i>

27:44.496 --> 27:47.916
<i>Honestly, I'm not even sure</i>
<i>who I am anymore.</i>

27:48.333 --> 27:51.878
<i>I mean, I was down there for so long,</i>
<i>I got lost,</i>

27:51.961 --> 27:53.546
<i>lost in who I used to be.</i>

27:53.630 --> 27:56.675
<i>And I have been trying so hard</i>
<i>to get back to the Lucifer I was,</i>

<i>the Lucifer that you know,</i>

<i>but...</i>

<i>Chloe,</i>

<i>it meant nothing.</i>

<i>You are the only thing that matters to me.</i>

<i>How do I know that you're not lying?</i>

28:20.448 --> 28:22.367
<i>'Cause you do that now, yeah? You lie.</i>

28:22.450 --> 28:23.410
<i>Not to you.</i>

28:24.994 --> 28:25.954
<i>You're different.</i>

<i>I need... I need to think.</i>

<i>Wha-- Detective!</i>

<i>[man] Nothing inspires </i>
<i>like a suborbital view.</i>

<i>Except, of course,</i>
<i>maybe one from the Red Planet.</i>

<i>-Detective, about last night--</i>
<i>-I don't want to talk about it.</i>

<i>...to making that dream come true.</i>

<i>-Excuse me.</i>
<i>-Excuse me.</i>

29:08.455 --> 29:10.582
<i>[man] I couldn't be prouder.</i>
<i>And let me tell you--</i>

<i>-Mr. Brody, do you have a minute to talk?</i>
<i>-I'm sorry,</i>

<i>if you guys wouldn't mind just</i>
<i>hanging back with the rest of the press.</i>

<i>Wait a sec.</i>

<i>I know you.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>-Thanks again, man.</i>
<i>-Heh.</i>

<i>Oh, it was very cool of you.</i>

<i>Thanks again, man.</i>

<i>That was really great of you...</i>

<i>Ooh.</i>

29:39.444 --> 29:41.654
<i>I'm devastated over Judy's death.</i>

29:41.738 --> 29:42.614
<i>Just sick.</i>

29:42.697 --> 29:44.657
<i>No one expects to lose an employee</i>
<i>like that.</i>

29:44.741 --> 29:46.326
<i>We know you were sleeping with her.</i>

29:48.244 --> 29:49.412
<i>An accomplished woman,</i>

29:49.746 --> 29:51.414
<i>maybe she didn't want to be</i>
<i>the side piece,</i>

29:51.498 --> 29:52.832
<i>maybe she didn't like sharing you.</i>

29:53.124 --> 29:56.544
<i>Yes, perhaps she threatened</i>
<i>to tell your wife, or the public.</i>

29:57.629 --> 29:59.214
<i>Uh... do I need a lawyer?</i>

29:59.297 --> 30:01.758
<i>No one had more access to the dome,</i>
<i>to the cameras.</i>

30:01.841 --> 30:04.052
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>no one has more motive than you.</i>

30:04.219 --> 30:07.096
<i>You know, I'd say</i>
<i>I definitely need a lawyer.</i>

30:09.891 --> 30:12.352
<i>[whispering] So right now might be</i>
<i>a good time to do your thing.</i>

30:13.645 --> 30:14.687
<i>My what?</i>

<i>Mr. Brody. Sorry, one last question.</i>

30:21.236 --> 30:22.278
<i>Get the car running.</i>

30:25.615 --> 30:26.449
<i>Tell me...</i>

<i>What is it that you</i>

<i>truly fear?</i>

<i>I...</i>

30:39.128 --> 30:40.255
<i>I'm afraid...</i>

<i>that...</i>

<i>people will find out.</i>

<i>That you killed Judy?</i>

30:48.096 --> 30:48.972
<i>No. </i>

30:49.848 --> 30:52.016
<i>That I hate space.</i>

30:52.851 --> 30:53.726
<i>[Brody sighs]</i>

30:53.810 --> 30:56.187
<i>This astronaut crap</i>
<i>scares the hell out of me!</i>

30:56.271 --> 30:59.899
<i>I just started the Mars Project</i>
<i>to compete with Bezos and Musk.</i>

30:59.983 --> 31:01.943
<i>It was a goddamn publicity stunt.</i>

31:02.026 --> 31:03.736
<i>So you don't want to go to Mars?</i>

31:03.820 --> 31:05.738
<i>That's why you're a sweaty little Betty?</i>

31:06.573 --> 31:08.950
<i>-I get carsick, for God's sake.</i>
<i>-Aww.</i>

31:09.033 --> 31:10.618
<i>I almost passed out in the simulation.</i>

31:10.952 --> 31:13.454
<i>How am I supposed to rocket my ass</i>
<i>to fricking Mars?</i>

31:13.913 --> 31:15.456
<i>Did Judy know it was all a sham?</i>

31:15.540 --> 31:18.167
<i>Not at first. She found out</i>
<i>when she was in the dome, actually.</i>

31:18.418 --> 31:21.921
<i>Called me, pissed,</i>
<i>threatening to tell everyone, the press.</i>

31:22.005 --> 31:23.882
<i>Well, even more reason for you </i>
<i>to want her dead.</i>

31:24.173 --> 31:25.133
<i>No, no, no.</i>

31:25.758 --> 31:26.926
<i>I talked her down,</i>

31:27.427 --> 31:29.762
<i>told her I had no choice now</i>
<i>but to go through with the trip.</i>

31:29.846 --> 31:31.347
<i>So, we made up.</i>

31:31.431 --> 31:34.642
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>I had nothing to do with her death.</i>

31:34.726 --> 31:36.436
<i>Do you have an alibi for three nights ago?</i>

31:36.519 --> 31:37.520
<i>I was home all night,</i>

31:37.604 --> 31:39.022
<i>vomiting my guts out,</i>

31:39.105 --> 31:41.649
<i>'cause the following morning,</i>
<i>I had to get in that stupid tin can.</i>

31:41.733 --> 31:43.192
<i>Well, can anyone corroborate?</i>

31:43.276 --> 31:44.444
<i>[sighs]</i>

31:45.904 --> 31:47.030
<i>I guess not.</i>

31:48.156 --> 31:50.658
<i>Yeah, I-- I'm not saying anything else</i>
<i>without my lawyer.</i>

31:51.492 --> 31:52.327
<i>[Brody sighs]</i>

31:53.828 --> 31:54.704
<i>[Chloe sighs]</i>

<i>Dan, hi.</i>

32:01.252 --> 32:02.295
<i>So Brody's lawyered up.</i>

32:02.378 --> 32:04.964
<i>We can't do anything </i>
<i>without more evidence, all right?</i>

32:05.924 --> 32:07.008
<i>Yeah, I'm headed back now.</i>

32:07.800 --> 32:08.760
<i>I, uh...</i>

32:09.218 --> 32:10.929
<i>I upset you even more back there,</i>
<i>didn't I?</i>

32:11.012 --> 32:12.889
<i>When I asked him what he truly feared.</i>

32:12.972 --> 32:13.806
<i>Uh...</i>

32:14.432 --> 32:16.142
<i>Actually, Lucifer, uh...</i>

32:17.018 --> 32:18.061
<i>just the opposite.</i>

32:18.144 --> 32:20.730
<i>I think it helped me understand.</i>

32:21.522 --> 32:23.024
<i>I've never been to Hell,</i>

32:23.107 --> 32:25.777
<i>and I hope I never will,</i>
<i>but from what you've told me...</i>

32:27.528 --> 32:29.113
<i>it's a truly terrible place,</i>

32:29.197 --> 32:31.574
<i>and if it really was</i>
<i>thousands of years for you,</i>

32:31.658 --> 32:34.452
<i>no wonder dishonesty and fear</i>
<i>followed you back.</i>

32:36.120 --> 32:38.289
<i>I mean, yes, you've changed,</i>

32:39.123 --> 32:42.043
<i>but it would be so strange if you hadn't.</i>

32:43.461 --> 32:45.338
<i>I think it's time that I accept that.</i>

32:47.048 --> 32:48.007
<i>[exhales]</i>

32:51.594 --> 32:52.804
<i>See you at the precinct?</i>

32:54.639 --> 32:55.473
<i>Right.</i>

32:56.099 --> 32:56.933
<i>Okay.</i>

33:04.315 --> 33:05.191
<i>[sighs]</i>

33:06.192 --> 33:07.068
<i>I told you.</i>

33:08.778 --> 33:11.406
<i>-Tequila upsets his stomach.</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

33:12.198 --> 33:13.449
<i>-Hey, Linda.</i>
<i>-Hi.</i>

33:13.533 --> 33:15.618
<i>-Is it noon already?</i>
<i>-[chuckles] Yeah.</i>

33:15.743 --> 33:17.745
<i>You know, I meant to call you, uh...</i>

33:18.830 --> 33:20.373
<i>Just wondering if it might be okay</i>

33:20.456 --> 33:23.126
<i>if I kept little Charlie here </i>
<i>for one more night.</i>

33:23.710 --> 33:24.627
<i>Aren't you working?</i>

33:24.711 --> 33:26.838
<i>Yeah, but there's no better place</i>
<i>for this little angel</i>

33:26.921 --> 33:28.756
<i>than right here, strapped to me.</i>

33:30.216 --> 33:31.217
<i>Amenadiel,</i>

33:31.968 --> 33:33.970
<i>when's the last time you put Charlie down?</i>

33:34.053 --> 33:36.723
<i>It's not that long, 15, 16 hours, maybe?</i>

33:37.473 --> 33:38.808
<i>Okay, Amenadiel, give me the baby.</i>

33:41.144 --> 33:42.311
<i>Okay...</i>

33:42.895 --> 33:43.730
<i>What's wrong?</i>

33:44.105 --> 33:45.273
<i>[Charlie coos]</i>

33:45.356 --> 33:46.691
<i>Okay, listen.</i>

33:46.774 --> 33:48.985
<i>I don't want to worry you,</i>
<i>all right? But, um...</i>

33:50.111 --> 33:51.195
<i>Lucifer's back.</i>

33:51.279 --> 33:52.572
<i>Okay, yeah, Chloe told me. So?</i>

33:53.239 --> 33:54.073
<i>"So?"</i>

33:54.157 --> 33:56.701
<i>So he's not in Hell.</i>
<i>He's not watching the demons.</i>

33:56.784 --> 33:59.871
<i>But Lucifer wouldn't come back</i>
<i>unless everything was okay, right?</i>

34:01.748 --> 34:03.458
<i>I suppose. He said as much.</i>

34:04.250 --> 34:06.002
<i>And it's Lucifer, he doesn't lie.</i>

34:10.548 --> 34:11.382
<i>What is it?</i>

34:13.092 --> 34:18.431
<i>Uh... no, it's just that Chloe told me</i>
<i>that apparently, since he's been back...</i>

34:19.265 --> 34:21.893
<i>Lucifer </i>has <i>started lying.</i>

34:22.894 --> 34:23.728
<i>What?</i>

34:25.146 --> 34:27.190
<i>Surely he wouldn't lie</i>
<i>about something like this.</i>

34:27.565 --> 34:28.399
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:28.816 --> 34:29.734
<i>Right.</i>

34:29.817 --> 34:31.527
<i>No, of course, you're right...</i>

34:32.028 --> 34:33.780
<i>We shouldn't let our fears</i>
<i>get the best of us.</i>

34:35.573 --> 34:37.366
<i>Okay. Come here, baby.</i>

34:37.575 --> 34:38.910
<i>[Charlie coos]</i>

34:40.161 --> 34:41.162
<i>[Maze] Decker.</i>

34:51.339 --> 34:52.215
<i>Hey.</i>

34:52.673 --> 34:53.549
<i>So, uh...</i>

34:54.425 --> 34:55.259
<i>You freaking out?</i>

34:55.343 --> 34:57.095
<i>I mean, seeing me and Lucifer together--</i>

34:57.178 --> 34:58.805
<i>Maze, I know what you're trying to do.</i>

34:59.889 --> 35:02.016
<i>-You do?</i>
<i>-Yeah, and you suck at it.</i>

35:02.100 --> 35:03.434
<i>-I do?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

35:03.518 --> 35:04.352
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

35:04.435 --> 35:08.272
<i>You're trying to apologize</i>
<i>in your very awkward, demon way.</i>

35:09.816 --> 35:11.734
<i>I am? [chuckles]</i>

35:12.568 --> 35:13.736
<i>Look... [sighs]</i>

35:14.737 --> 35:15.905
<i>...I was pissed.</i>

35:15.988 --> 35:18.241
<i>It was devastating walking in on you</i>
<i>and Lucifer like that.</i>

35:18.324 --> 35:19.283
<i>It was.</i>

35:20.243 --> 35:21.744
<i>But I know that you're...</i>

35:22.203 --> 35:23.371
<i>[sighs deeply]</i>

35:23.454 --> 35:25.456
<i>You know, you're in a vulnerable place</i>
<i>right now.</i>

35:25.540 --> 35:26.374
<i>You're lonely.</i>

35:27.375 --> 35:28.417
<i>You're missing Eve.</i>

35:29.418 --> 35:33.172
<i>And it helped me to understand</i>
<i>that Lucifer is also hurting, too.</i>

35:34.048 --> 35:37.385
<i>He's desperate for love and affection,</i>
<i>deeply desperate.</i>

35:37.468 --> 35:40.471
<i>I mean, obviously, if he was gonna</i>
<i>reach out to you.</i>

35:41.055 --> 35:45.768
<i>It also made me realize that</i>
<i>I want to be the one who is there for him.</i>

35:46.936 --> 35:47.812
<i>In every way.</i>

35:48.938 --> 35:53.234
<i>In fact, I think it's time for us to take</i>
<i>our relationship to the next level.</i>

35:53.693 --> 35:56.028
<i>Are you saying you're gonna bone him?</i>

35:57.321 --> 35:58.197
<i>I mean...</i>

35:58.614 --> 36:01.701
<i>Hopefully it's, like,</i>
<i>a little more romantic than that.</i>

36:01.784 --> 36:03.452
<i>But yeah, um...</i>

36:04.120 --> 36:05.746
<i>I think we've waited long enough.</i>

36:13.129 --> 36:14.630
<i>[snoring]</i>

36:23.514 --> 36:25.141
<i>Aragorn, that's not your sword.</i>

36:26.851 --> 36:28.978
<i>I'm... I'm totally awake. I'm awake.</i>

36:30.730 --> 36:33.065
<i>I think it's time</i>
<i>to go get some coffee, Lucifer.</i>

36:41.574 --> 36:42.950
<i>[both chuckle]</i>

37:04.931 --> 37:06.349
<i>[both chuckle]</i>

37:07.892 --> 37:09.268
<i>[both chuckle]</i>

37:13.439 --> 37:14.315
<i>That's good.</i>

37:18.569 --> 37:19.528
<i>Mm.</i>

37:22.531 --> 37:23.491
<i>Mm.</i>

37:26.202 --> 37:28.996
<i>You know, I am hungry.</i>

37:30.039 --> 37:32.750
<i>Do you want anything</i>
<i>from the vending machine?</i>

37:33.876 --> 37:35.294
<i>Oh, shoot.</i>

37:35.378 --> 37:37.296
<i>I, um, forgot my money.</i>

37:38.756 --> 37:42.051
<i>-Do you mind if...</i>
<i>-[quivering breaths]</i>

37:46.347 --> 37:48.015
<i>-[trembling breaths]</i>
<i>-[Chloe sighs]</i>

37:50.768 --> 37:51.852
<i>[chuckling exhale]</i>

37:55.481 --> 37:56.607
<i>[Chloe exhales deeply]</i>

37:57.024 --> 37:59.944
<i>-[exhales sharply]</i>
<i>-So, um... what do you think?</i>

38:00.027 --> 38:01.779
<i>You want your favorite? The, uh...</i>

38:02.613 --> 38:04.073
<i>The ranch puffs, or...</i>

38:04.657 --> 38:06.617
<i>-Uh...</i>
<i>-...maybe something different?</i>

38:11.455 --> 38:12.873
<i>You know, I've been thinking.</i>

38:13.916 --> 38:15.084
<i>You are different,</i>

38:15.167 --> 38:18.045
<i>but sometimes change is a good thing.</i>

38:19.880 --> 38:20.840
<i>You know, I...</i>

38:22.258 --> 38:23.884
<i>I think I like this new Lucifer.</i>

38:25.011 --> 38:26.012
<i>You've grown.</i>

38:30.099 --> 38:35.354
<i>I've been stuck in</i>
<i>an old version of us, and, uh...</i>

38:37.523 --> 38:40.860
<i>maybe it's time for me</i>
<i>to move forward, or...</i>

38:41.360 --> 38:43.863
<i>for us to move forward together.</i>

38:44.822 --> 38:45.740
<i>[Michael gulps]</i>

38:46.324 --> 38:48.701
<i>How about after we solve this case, I...</i>

38:49.869 --> 38:51.287
<i>I come over to your place?</i>

38:52.913 --> 38:53.831
<i>Okay.</i>

39:02.256 --> 39:03.341
<i>Oh, look at us.</i>

39:06.344 --> 39:07.178
<i>Yes.</i>

39:07.928 --> 39:09.430
<i>It's rather lovely, isn't it?</i>

39:10.973 --> 39:11.807
<i>[gasps]</i>

39:12.350 --> 39:13.851
<i>Maybe there's a reflection.</i>

39:16.270 --> 39:17.146
<i>Excuse me.</i>

39:19.857 --> 39:20.816
<i>Reflection...</i>

39:24.028 --> 39:24.862
<i>Lucifer.</i>

39:27.698 --> 39:28.574
<i>Lucifer?</i>

39:30.701 --> 39:32.036
<i>Oh, Dr. Linda Martin! Hello.</i>

39:32.119 --> 39:33.371
<i>So it's true.</i>

39:33.788 --> 39:34.872
<i>Here you are. [chuckles]</i>

39:34.955 --> 39:36.457
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-That's great.</i>

39:36.540 --> 39:37.792
<i>You must be so happy.</i>

39:38.292 --> 39:39.418
<i>Everyone must be so--</i>

39:39.502 --> 39:40.836
<i>Who's watching Hell?</i>

39:40.920 --> 39:43.005
<i>What? Oh, don't worry about that. </i>
<i>It's fine.</i>

39:43.089 --> 39:46.717
<i>Uh, yeah, because the last time</i>
<i>Hell was left unattended,</i>

39:46.801 --> 39:48.511
<i>demons came and grabbed my baby,</i>

39:48.594 --> 39:50.930
<i>so I'm going to need a little more than</i>
<i>"It's fine."</i>

39:51.013 --> 39:52.848
<i>Yes, I understand,</i>
<i>you're afraid for your child.</i>

39:52.932 --> 39:55.935
<i>Yeah, I'm not afraid he's gonna</i>
<i>fall off the swings, Lucifer.</i>

39:56.018 --> 39:58.104
<i>Do you not remember what happened?</i>

40:00.147 --> 40:01.524
<i>They took Charlie.</i>

40:01.607 --> 40:03.734
<i>They tried to take him to Hell.</i>

40:03.818 --> 40:05.069
<i>That's a big deal.</i>

40:05.820 --> 40:08.781
<i>So of course I'm going to be afraid</i>
<i>for my child.</i>

40:09.156 --> 40:10.825
<i>I need to keep this baby safe.</i>

40:16.038 --> 40:17.123
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

40:17.748 --> 40:19.375
<i>You're afraid for your baby, but...</i>

40:21.377 --> 40:22.878
<i>it's more than that, isn't it?</i>

40:24.338 --> 40:27.758
<i>You're afraid of being a bad mother,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

40:30.052 --> 40:31.679
<i>And why do I get the feeling...</i>

40:32.763 --> 40:34.473
<i>you have a good reason for that?</i>

40:41.480 --> 40:44.358
<i>But don't worry.</i>
<i>Hell's being looked after, I promise you.</i>

40:47.361 --> 40:49.447
<i>And the more I think about it,</i>

40:49.530 --> 40:51.824
<i>the more it might just stay that way.</i>

40:59.457 --> 41:00.666
<i>[Chloe sighs]</i>

41:00.749 --> 41:03.043
<i>Can you go to the moment</i>
<i>right before the cameras shut off?</i>

41:03.127 --> 41:03.961
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

41:04.712 --> 41:05.671
<i>Mm.</i> <i>Nada.</i>

41:06.130 --> 41:07.131
<i>Oh.</i>

41:07.214 --> 41:08.215
<i>Fast-forward a bit.</i>

41:08.591 --> 41:10.050
<i>Keep going, keep going.</i>

41:10.426 --> 41:12.094
<i>More... There. Freeze.</i>

41:12.761 --> 41:13.929
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

41:14.013 --> 41:15.764
<i>You're right. There's a reflection.</i>

41:16.724 --> 41:18.392
<i>Whoever killed Judy</i>

41:18.476 --> 41:21.729
<i>only wiped the camera footage</i>
<i>from the time they stepped into frame.</i>

41:21.812 --> 41:23.939
<i>They didn't even think</i>
<i>about their reflection.</i>

41:24.773 --> 41:26.692
<i>Ack. I can't see their face, though.</i>

41:26.775 --> 41:28.360
<i>Is there a way to tell whose suit it is?</i>

41:28.444 --> 41:29.987
<i>[Ella] It's none of them. Look. I mean,</i>

41:30.070 --> 41:31.989
<i>that one has an external oxygen tube,</i>

41:32.072 --> 41:35.201
<i>but the ones from the Red 2 Mars Project,</i>
<i>look, nada.</i>

41:35.284 --> 41:36.827
<i>Those must be built into the suit.</i>

41:36.911 --> 41:39.830
<i>Do you think the change</i>
<i>would be considered an improvement?</i>

41:39.914 --> 41:41.165
<i>Definitely, yeah.</i>

41:41.248 --> 41:43.959
<i>Okay. I might have an idea</i>
<i>of where the old suit came from.</i>

41:44.502 --> 41:45.628
<i>-Lucifer?</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

41:45.711 --> 41:46.670
<i>Let's go.</i>

41:46.754 --> 41:48.130
<i>-Right. Right.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

41:56.847 --> 41:59.934
<i>Well, it's late. We should probably</i>
<i>just come back tomorrow morning.</i>

42:01.977 --> 42:02.895
<i>[lock breaks]</i>

42:03.687 --> 42:05.481
<i>Lucifer, we don't even have a warrant.</i>

42:06.106 --> 42:06.941
<i>Huh.</i>

42:08.651 --> 42:09.568
<i>[Chloe sighs]</i>

42:23.082 --> 42:24.041
<i>Lucifer.</i>

42:25.084 --> 42:26.043
<i>Lucifer.</i>

42:27.628 --> 42:28.629
<i>Where are you?</i>

42:38.973 --> 42:40.933
<i>[sighs] Nothing.</i>

42:41.016 --> 42:41.976
<i>Well, let's go.</i>

42:42.560 --> 42:43.477
<i>[gun cocks]</i>

42:48.857 --> 42:49.984
<i>[gun fires]</i>

<i>[gun fires]</i>

42:55.364 --> 42:56.407
<i>[gun cocks]</i>

42:56.490 --> 42:57.700
<i>Sam Chavez!</i>

42:58.200 --> 43:00.035
<i>LAPD! Hold your fire!</i>

43:00.494 --> 43:01.453
<i>LAPD?</i>

43:02.121 --> 43:03.247
<i>Oh, my God. Thank God.</i>

43:05.040 --> 43:07.167
<i>-[Chloe] Drop the gun.</i>
<i>-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

43:10.421 --> 43:12.715
<i>You're under arrest</i>
<i>for the murder of Judy Mason.</i>

43:12.798 --> 43:13.799
<i>Wait a minute, what?</i>

43:14.633 --> 43:16.719
<i>No, no. I didn't kill Judy. </i>
<i>Anders Brody did.</i>

43:18.053 --> 43:20.180
<i>That's who I thought you were.</i>
<i>That's why I shot at you.</i>

43:20.264 --> 43:22.766
<i>And you know Brody killed Judy how?</i>

43:23.434 --> 43:26.395
<i>Judy found out the Mars Project</i>
<i>was just a, a publicity stunt.</i>

43:26.937 --> 43:30.816
<i>She told me. We started working together</i>
<i>to find proof to bring it to the press,</i>

43:30.899 --> 43:35.195
<i>but she was just too emotionally invested</i>
<i>with the project and with Brody, and...</i>

43:35.696 --> 43:38.991
<i>You know, I warned her.</i>
<i>I warned her not to confront him, but...</i>

43:40.743 --> 43:42.286
<i>[sighs] she got impatient, and...</i>

43:42.870 --> 43:43.704
<i>now she's dead.</i>

43:43.787 --> 43:45.122
<i>Why didn't you tell us earlier?</i>

43:45.205 --> 43:46.498
<i>Do you know Anders Brody?</i>

43:46.582 --> 43:49.418
<i>His reputation means everything to him.</i>
<i>I thought he'd come after me next.</i>

43:49.501 --> 43:51.211
<i>It's a clever ruse, but it won't work.</i>

43:51.295 --> 43:53.255
<i>All the evidence points to you.</i>

43:53.339 --> 43:55.132
<i>What evidence? What are you talking about?</i>

43:55.215 --> 43:57.593
<i>[Chloe] You're the only person with access</i>
<i>to Mission Control,</i>

43:57.676 --> 43:58.761
<i>video surveillance.</i>

43:58.844 --> 44:01.513
<i>You owned a space suit</i>
<i>for the Red 1 Mars Project.</i>

44:01.597 --> 44:04.224
<i>The cameras captured</i>
<i>a reflection of your suit</i>

44:04.308 --> 44:07.603
<i>heading towards the dome just seconds</i>
<i>before the cameras were wiped.</i>

44:07.686 --> 44:11.523
<i>And if I hazard a guess,</i>
<i>this tacky rug is sheepskin</i>

44:11.607 --> 44:14.151
<i>and matches a hair</i>
<i>found at the crime scene.</i>

44:16.612 --> 44:18.155
<i>Oh, no. No, no, no.</i>

44:19.698 --> 44:21.075
<i>You're right, I'll go with you.</i>

44:22.117 --> 44:23.160
<i>Sam's lying.</i>

44:23.452 --> 44:24.328
<i>He didn't do it.</i>

44:25.913 --> 44:26.955
<i>I killed Judy.</i>

44:28.540 --> 44:29.708
<i>[Chloe] Drop the knife, Mandy.</i>

44:29.792 --> 44:31.877
<i>No, I don't want to hurt anyone else,</i>
<i>it's just...</i>

44:31.960 --> 44:34.046
<i>I brought it as proof</i>
<i>it's the murder weapon.</i>

44:34.505 --> 44:36.799
<i>Oh, it looks like Brody and Judy</i>
<i>weren't the only ones</i>

44:36.882 --> 44:39.259
<i>breaking the "No fraternizing </i>
<i>at work" rule.</i>

44:39.343 --> 44:40.552
<i>[Sam] I don't understand.</i>

44:40.636 --> 44:42.930
<i>You took my suit and you killed Judy?</i>

44:43.681 --> 44:45.474
<i>-Why?</i>
<i>-I thought you were in love with her.</i>

44:46.016 --> 44:48.477
<i>I mean, you were sneaking around, </i>
<i>and, and... </i>

44:48.560 --> 44:49.812
<i>[sighs] hiding things.</i>

44:49.895 --> 44:52.272
<i>and then I caught you</i>
<i>on the phone with her, whispering.</i>

44:52.356 --> 44:54.024
<i>No, I was working with her</i>
<i>to expose Brody.</i>

44:54.108 --> 44:55.567
<i>The whole Mars Project is fake.</i>

44:57.027 --> 44:57.861
<i>What?</i>

45:00.531 --> 45:01.907
<i>Why didn't you say anything?</i>

45:02.366 --> 45:04.076
<i>'Cause I was trying to keep you safe.</i>

45:06.912 --> 45:09.540
<i>You know, when you went away</i>
<i>on that first project, I waited for you.</i>

45:10.124 --> 45:11.667
<i>You were gone for so long.</i>

45:11.750 --> 45:13.669
<i>And when you came back,</i>
<i>you were so different.</i>

45:13.752 --> 45:15.379
<i>I thought you didn't love me anymore.</i>

45:15.462 --> 45:19.591
<i>It doesn't matter where I am.</i>
<i>Here, the moon, Mars...</i>

45:19.675 --> 45:21.760
<i>It does not matter. There is nothing...</i>

45:22.845 --> 45:24.888
<i>that will change the way</i>
<i>that I feel about you.</i>

45:24.972 --> 45:26.473
<i>Even if I'm in prison?</i>

45:26.557 --> 45:27.391
<i>Nothing.</i>

45:31.270 --> 45:32.771
<i>[sobs]</i>

45:33.397 --> 45:35.566
<i>[handcuffs rattling]</i>

<i>[elevator dings]</i>

45:48.537 --> 45:50.164
<i>Detective!</i>

45:50.247 --> 45:52.207
<i>No. It's just me.</i>

45:53.542 --> 45:55.878
<i>I know what you're about to do</i>
<i>and I won't let you.</i>

45:57.045 --> 46:00.382
<i>I have my... issues with Lucifer,</i>

46:01.133 --> 46:03.594
<i>and yeah, I am kind of pissed at Chloe.</i>

46:03.677 --> 46:05.429
<i>But this? No.</i>

46:06.263 --> 46:07.514
<i>Kissing me was one thing.</i>

46:08.849 --> 46:10.893
<i>Chloe is a good person.</i>
<i>She doesn't deserve this.</i>

46:10.976 --> 46:12.311
<i>[in American accent] You're right.</i>

46:12.394 --> 46:14.897
<i>You are right. Chloe is special.</i>

46:15.773 --> 46:18.192
<i>Which is why I've changed my mind...</i>

46:18.817 --> 46:19.943
<i>and... [chuckles]</i>

46:20.527 --> 46:22.696
<i>...I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>Chloe has, too, actually.</i>

46:23.822 --> 46:25.157
<i>It seems that, uh,</i>

46:25.741 --> 46:28.285
<i>she likes this new Lucifer</i>
<i>even better than the old.</i>

46:28.368 --> 46:29.828
<i>You told her who you really are?</i>

46:29.912 --> 46:30.788
<i>No.</i>

46:31.330 --> 46:33.248
<i>No, but I will, in time.</i>

46:34.500 --> 46:37.628
<i>See, I've decided</i>
<i>I'm not going to break Lucifer's life.</i>

46:38.295 --> 46:39.213
<i>[chuckles]</i>

46:39.463 --> 46:40.547
<i>I'm gonna take it.</i>

46:42.216 --> 46:43.759
<i>So, if you'll excuse me.</i>

46:45.135 --> 46:46.220
<i>Yeah, that's not--</i>

46:46.303 --> 46:47.137
<i>[choking]</i>

46:48.722 --> 46:49.890
<i>[grunting]</i>

<i>I have a date to keep.</i>

<i>[elevator dings]</i>

47:18.210 --> 47:19.044
<i>Lucifer?</i>

47:21.046 --> 47:22.923
<i>I'll be there in a moment, Detective.</i>

47:23.006 --> 47:23.882
<i>Okay.</i>

47:30.347 --> 47:31.557
<i>[sighs]</i>

47:39.231 --> 47:40.107
<i>Good evening.</i>

47:43.026 --> 47:43.861
<i>Hi.</i>

47:47.406 --> 47:49.616
<i>Do you remember the last time</i>
<i>we were here?</i>

47:50.576 --> 47:51.451
<i>Of course.</i>

47:53.036 --> 47:54.788
<i>We told each other how we felt.</i>

47:57.249 --> 48:00.919
<i>I just hope you know that</i>
<i>I meant every word I said.</i>

48:01.128 --> 48:02.004
<i>I...</i>

48:06.008 --> 48:07.175
<i>I love you, Lucifer.</i>

48:08.552 --> 48:09.636
<i>And I still do.</i>

48:10.596 --> 48:11.930
<i>And I meant it, too.</i>

48:13.515 --> 48:15.183
<i>I love you, Chloe.</i>

48:16.643 --> 48:17.519
<i>[sighs]</i>

48:18.020 --> 48:18.979
<i>Oh...</i>

48:19.938 --> 48:21.773
<i>I've waited such a long time for this.</i>

48:21.857 --> 48:22.733
<i>Oh...</i>

48:23.817 --> 48:24.776
<i>Me, too.</i>

48:25.110 --> 48:26.528
<i>[both chuckling]</i>

48:27.738 --> 48:29.281
<i>-[Michael] Oh!</i>
<i>-Hmm.</i>

48:33.619 --> 48:35.829
<i>[Michael sighs deeply]</i>

48:37.331 --> 48:38.165
<i>See?</i>

48:39.333 --> 48:40.417
<i>Still have it on.</i>

48:41.752 --> 48:43.879
<i>I can see that. [chuckles]</i>

48:45.005 --> 48:46.381
<i>-You know...</i>
<i>-Mm?</i>

48:48.050 --> 48:50.427
<i>-...once we do this...</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

48:52.763 --> 48:54.681
<i>...things are never going to be the same.</i>

48:55.724 --> 48:56.892
<i>I believe you're right.</i>

49:01.021 --> 49:02.522
<i>-[gun fires]</i>
<i>-[Michael screams]</i>

49:02.606 --> 49:03.982
<i>[groans]</i>

49:04.775 --> 49:05.692
<i>[panting]</i>

49:06.109 --> 49:08.487
<i>Once I shot Lucifer</i>
<i>to prove he was the Devil,</i>

49:08.570 --> 49:10.864
<i>and now I'm shooting you</i>
<i>to prove you're not.</i>

49:17.829 --> 49:18.914
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

49:20.582 --> 49:23.043
<i>[breaths heavily]</i>

49:26.505 --> 49:28.256
<i>[in American accent] </i>
<i>How long have you known?</i>

49:29.549 --> 49:32.177
<i>I knew something was off</i>
<i>the first time I kissed you.</i>

49:33.637 --> 49:37.224
<i>But you always had such good explanations,</i>
<i>such good lies.</i>

49:38.058 --> 49:39.393
<i>I wanted to believe you.</i>

49:41.144 --> 49:43.438
<i>But then I saw you with Maze.</i>

49:45.148 --> 49:46.441
<i>That's when I knew.</i>

49:47.693 --> 49:49.194
<i>Lucifer would never...</i>

49:50.028 --> 49:50.988
<i>do that to me.</i>

49:53.490 --> 49:54.324
<i>So...</i>

49:55.033 --> 49:55.867
<i>Who are you?</i>

49:57.995 --> 49:59.371
<i>I'm Lucifer's brother.</i>

50:00.163 --> 50:01.039
<i>Michael.</i>

50:02.624 --> 50:03.667
<i>It's nice to meet--</i>

50:03.750 --> 50:04.584
<i>Ow!</i>

50:04.668 --> 50:06.712
<i>You know that won't kill me.</i>

50:07.379 --> 50:10.132
<i>-[grunts]</i>
<i>-Yeah, but it makes me feel better.</i>

50:10.674 --> 50:12.175
<i>Okay, okay, okay. I get it.</i>

50:12.884 --> 50:13.719
<i>[chuckles]</i>

50:13.802 --> 50:16.096
<i>[panting] I get it.</i>

50:17.597 --> 50:18.432
<i>So what?</i>

50:19.016 --> 50:22.769
<i>I guess this means you never</i>
<i>really liked the new Lucifer.</i>

50:22.853 --> 50:24.646
<i>You're not the only one who can lie,</i>

50:25.355 --> 50:27.482
<i>and you are no Lucifer.</i>

50:31.153 --> 50:34.364
<i>I don't know why you're here</i>
<i>and I don't care,</i>

50:34.448 --> 50:36.533
<i>but I do know that I am glad,</i>

50:36.616 --> 50:38.827
<i>because you made me realize</i>

50:38.910 --> 50:42.164
<i>that all my fears that Lucifer had changed</i>
<i>were just that.</i>

50:44.332 --> 50:45.625
<i>They were fears.</i>

50:46.418 --> 50:48.670
<i>What Lucifer and I have is special.</i>

50:49.254 --> 50:52.174
<i>It's real, and it doesn't matter</i>
<i>how many lies you tell me.</i>

50:52.257 --> 50:54.760
<i>I will never lose faith...</i>

50:55.844 --> 50:56.845
<i>in me and him.</i>

50:58.722 --> 50:59.639
<i>Oh, really?</i>

51:00.599 --> 51:01.767
<i>No more lies, huh?</i>

51:03.727 --> 51:06.271
<i>Well, how about a truth, then?</i>

51:08.982 --> 51:09.858
<i>You...</i>

51:10.609 --> 51:13.320
<i>are a gift from God, Chloe Decker.</i>

51:17.449 --> 51:18.575
<i>What does that mean?</i>

51:19.284 --> 51:22.245
<i>It means that you were</i>
<i>never supposed to exist.</i>

51:23.038 --> 51:26.291
<i>Father made you for Lucifer.</i>

51:27.542 --> 51:30.587
<i>You were put here on Earth only for him,</i>

51:31.421 --> 51:33.757
<i>to be his little plaything.</i>

51:38.220 --> 51:40.680
<i>Now, isn't that special?</i>

51:42.724 --> 51:43.725
<i>[scoffs]</i>

51:44.476 --> 51:45.852
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

51:47.896 --> 51:49.064
<i>[chuckles]</i>

51:51.191 --> 51:52.400
<i>It's time for you to go.</i>

51:54.277 --> 51:55.153
<i>Get out!</i>

51:59.199 --> 52:01.993
<i>[gasping]</i>

52:10.001 --> 52:11.169
<i>[exhales deeply]</i>

52:24.516 --> 52:25.684
<i>You're up late...</i>

52:29.688 --> 52:30.522
<i>Michael.</i>

52:34.067 --> 52:35.986
<i>Congratulations, bro.</i>

52:36.736 --> 52:39.322
<i>Used to take you forever</i>
<i>to figure out I was playing you.</i>

52:39.406 --> 52:41.908
<i>You shouldn't have used fear</i>
<i>to get inside my head.</i>

52:42.617 --> 52:44.035
<i>You shouldn't have done that.</i>

52:45.203 --> 52:46.580
<i>It was way too obvious.</i>

52:50.333 --> 52:51.626
<i>Does Father know you're here?</i>

52:51.710 --> 52:53.795
<i>Oh, please. I do what I want.</i>

52:56.173 --> 52:57.340
<i>Go home, Michael.</i>

52:58.633 --> 53:00.010
<i>You don't belong here.</i>

53:00.093 --> 53:02.304
<i>Well, I could.</i>

53:02.679 --> 53:06.183
<i>And when I get there, I could also</i>
<i>tell Remy it's time to come back,</i>

53:06.266 --> 53:08.143
<i>'cause you know who else</i>
<i>doesn't belong here?</i>

53:08.977 --> 53:12.314
<i>That's right. Your son, Chucky.</i>

53:13.732 --> 53:15.525
<i>I'm not afraid of you, Michael.</i>

53:16.902 --> 53:17.944
<i>Now go home.</i>

53:22.115 --> 53:24.075
<i>Lucifer's life sucks anyway.</i>

53:24.826 --> 53:26.620
<i>The only thing worse is the traffic.</i>

53:28.538 --> 53:31.082
<i>Oh, I think thou doth protest too much.</i>

53:33.752 --> 53:36.671
<i>You see, you pride yourself</i>
<i>on exploiting everyone's fears,</i>

53:36.755 --> 53:38.465
<i>but we've always known yours.</i>

53:40.133 --> 53:42.761
<i>You're terrified that</i>
<i>Lucifer is better than you.</i>

53:43.845 --> 53:45.597
<i>That he'll always be</i>

53:46.097 --> 53:47.140
<i>better than you.</i>

53:49.601 --> 53:51.019
<i>Please.</i>
