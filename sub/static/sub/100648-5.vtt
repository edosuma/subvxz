00:04.091 --> 00:05.788
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

00:05.831 --> 00:06.789
- I got fired from tutoring.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.008
They said I took
their stupid pen.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.661
- She's not me.

00:09.705 --> 00:11.402
- I tried to seduce
my therapist.

00:11.446 --> 00:12.360
He straight up rejected me.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.144
- You have a storied history

00:14.188 --> 00:15.798
of pursuing inaccessible men,

00:15.841 --> 00:18.279
which is a defense mechanism
to protect you from rejection.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.107
- You're gonna like her.
She has birds.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.108
-  Good night.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.413
- So we wanted to talk to you

00:22.457 --> 00:24.546
about doing some
custom work for us.

00:24.589 --> 00:25.938
Casino night.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.375
- If it got into
the wrong hands,

00:27.418 --> 00:29.464
it's kinda, like, counterfeit.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.727
- That did not even occur
to me.

00:31.770 --> 00:34.164
- He's alive.
I'm dead!

00:34.208 --> 00:36.340
- Word is, you do
the best work.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.125
I'd like to see how it's done.

00:40.344 --> 00:43.565
- What do you think?
- I think I need you alive.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.227
- Customer's here for you.

00:53.270 --> 00:56.882
- Who is it?
- Lewis baby shower.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.580
- I'll be right there.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.242
Congratulations, Mr. Lewis.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.247
Everything in order?

01:13.290 --> 01:15.249
- You'll know if it isn't.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.212
- Yo.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.435
- Welcome to
the Paper Porcupine.

01:27.478 --> 01:30.873
- Here for the Shapiro
bris announcements.

01:30.916 --> 01:34.094
- Of course, Mr. Shapiro.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.399
Back to school night, right?

01:35.443 --> 01:38.707
- Northfield Christian Academy.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.056
- Back in a jiffy.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.547
- Morning, sunshine.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.420
Wow, they don't build them
like this anymore.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.641
- Pickup's not today.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.687
- Is this where the ink goes?

02:02.731 --> 02:05.516
- Oil.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.432
Can I help you with something?

02:08.476 --> 02:10.782
Please--

02:10.826 --> 02:12.654
Please don't do that.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.830
- Okay, my bad.

02:14.873 --> 02:17.528
What tension do you set
the rollers at?

02:17.572 --> 02:21.184
- Why?
- Just curious.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.970
- Why?

02:25.014 --> 02:27.538
- 'Cause I'm a curious guy.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.845
- Well, you could look
at the manual,

02:29.888 --> 02:32.239
but there isn't one because
this is older than the Bible.

02:38.723 --> 02:39.855
See you soon.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.648
- Eww.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.390
- They didn't give me a knife.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.524
- I don't want your grubby-ass
house key on my BMT.

02:56.567 --> 02:59.353
- Gym locker key.
- Gross.

02:59.396 --> 03:01.311
- I barely use it.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.921
- Why didn't you just get
two six-inch?

03:02.965 --> 03:06.011
- Because the foot-long comes
with chips and a drink.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.491
- All good, thanks.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.496
- You know, I would love
to be rolling in six-inchers,

03:12.540 --> 03:15.978
but instead I am working
my ass off for nothing.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.675
- Yeah, 'cause I just love

03:17.719 --> 03:19.851
being homey's
indentured servant.

03:19.895 --> 03:22.898
- Coming home covered in ink
and self-loathing.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.553
- Where is she?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.643
- Voilà.

03:29.905 --> 03:31.298
- Thanks.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.778
- Lock the doors.
- What?

03:33.822 --> 03:35.519
- Hit the locks.
- But they don't work.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.868
They're broken.
- What's going on?

03:36.912 --> 03:39.001
- Take this home
and hide it somewhere.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.307
- Why?

03:40.350 --> 03:41.743
- And only take it out
when we're printing.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.878
- What is happening right now?
- This is insurance.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.619
- For what?

03:48.663 --> 03:50.708
- Anyone can run a printer,
right?

03:50.752 --> 03:53.494
But you need these plates
to make our money,

03:53.537 --> 03:56.497
so if one of us disappears...
- Why would we disappear?

03:57.498 --> 03:59.630
- When he's done with us.

04:02.198 --> 04:04.374
- Jesus.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.595
- Yeah.
- Oy.

04:09.684 --> 04:11.425
- You guys get me
a sandwich?

04:14.993 --> 04:16.430
- Yeah.

04:31.053 --> 04:34.491
- Oh, my God, Sara.
What--what are you doing?

04:34.535 --> 04:36.319
Two fingers?
Really?

04:36.363 --> 04:38.278
- So much cream cheese.
- Yeah, it's a lot of cream--

04:38.321 --> 04:39.540
it's a lot--it's a lot--

04:39.583 --> 04:40.584
it's a lot of cream cheese.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.456
- What's all this?
- Hey, baby.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.892
Got you poppy seed.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.502
- They have chocolate
cream cheese.

04:45.546 --> 04:48.940
- I'm sorry, did you just
put that with your lox?

04:48.984 --> 04:50.942
Eww!

04:50.986 --> 04:53.597
Oh.
- How long you guys been awake?

04:53.641 --> 04:56.165
- Uh, baby girl wanted to go
to the early-morning service.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.775
- She did, did she?

04:57.819 --> 04:59.560
- Yeah, I didn't
wanna wake you.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.736
- Daddy said you worked late.

05:01.779 --> 05:02.911
- Now...

05:02.954 --> 05:04.956
Lil' Money, he still
in there sawing logs.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.480
I went in there with
his video game music,

05:06.523 --> 05:09.221
put it to the boy's ear--
nothing.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.354
- You could have woke me up.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.400
- Where's that chocolate stuff?
- I put it in the fridge.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.531
- Okay, I see what you doing.

05:14.575 --> 05:15.967
Trying to keep your own stash.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.798
Okay, now, I'm gonna put
this stuff under his nose,

05:20.842 --> 05:22.626
and if this sugar shock
doesn't wake that boy up,

05:22.670 --> 05:24.324
nothing will.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.586
- Oh, Harry!

05:39.556 --> 05:42.037
- So you just found God?

05:42.080 --> 05:43.038
- What?

05:44.518 --> 05:46.781
- Game recognize game, peanut.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.478
I'm just saying.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.742
- Nope, that didn't work.
Okay.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.528
Oh, time to pull out
the big guns.

06:00.969 --> 06:03.537
- ♪ I forget what it's about

06:06.409 --> 06:08.542
♪ Living in my head

06:10.935 --> 06:13.721
♪ I hurt my own heart best

06:13.764 --> 06:16.114
♪ But who cares anyway

06:16.158 --> 06:20.031
♪ What should I worry
myself for ♪

06:20.075 --> 06:23.644
♪ Myself for

06:23.687 --> 06:25.602
♪ Turn the blame away

06:34.089 --> 06:36.091
- Break's over.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.440
- Go again?

06:37.484 --> 06:40.095
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.402
I'm like a chick.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.055
- Let's just leave it
on a high note.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.579
- Hey, uh, can I...

06:46.754 --> 06:50.279
And I'm not complaining,
but, uh...

06:50.322 --> 06:53.282
what's happening here?

06:53.325 --> 06:54.588
- I'm getting over someone

06:54.631 --> 06:57.112
by getting in front
of someone else.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.244
Cool?
- Happy to help.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.420
- Good man.

07:00.463 --> 07:01.943
- Hey, uh, do you mind if we

07:01.986 --> 07:04.075
just do it at your place
next time?

07:04.119 --> 07:05.903
- I have a kid.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.732
- Yeah, and I have this,
like, back thing,

07:08.776 --> 07:10.342
and tiles just--
- Okay.

07:10.386 --> 07:13.128
So we'll go to your place.
- We already did that.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.569
You live in your car.

07:19.613 --> 07:23.051
That's kinda how I got
this back thing.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.748
- You're homeless.

07:24.792 --> 07:28.143
- I'm experiencing
homelessness.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.408
- Got it.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.497
- You mind if I take
a shower here?

07:35.585 --> 07:37.282
- We don't have a shower.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.849
- Sink?

07:51.340 --> 07:52.646
- Thank you.

07:59.653 --> 08:02.482
- Wake--wake up.
- What?

08:03.570 --> 08:05.006
What is it?

08:05.049 --> 08:07.008
- It's a massacre.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.707
- What did you do?

08:10.751 --> 08:12.622
- I killed them all.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.495
- How much did you feed them?

08:15.538 --> 08:18.498
- Too much.
Well...

08:18.541 --> 08:22.197
not enough.
I--I ju--I don't know.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.505
- They're not ready for this.

08:31.336 --> 08:34.035
- I read about this thing.
They can get an STD.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.253
- Eww, gross.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.647
- No, it's called
sudden tank death.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.040
- It's gotta be the water.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.608
- Yeah, I tested it with those
little strip thingies.

08:41.651 --> 08:44.567
One, two, three, up.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.830
Easy.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.658
We'll just tell them
they were sick and we took them

08:48.702 --> 08:50.181
to the fish doctor.
- I'll grab towels.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.403
- And pick up some new ones
on the way home from work.

08:54.446 --> 08:55.926
- They're gonna know.

08:57.754 --> 09:00.061
- They're goldfish, Dean.
They all look the same.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.897
- What's this?

09:16.077 --> 09:18.601
- Nothing.
- Doesn't look like nothing.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.909
- It's for work.

09:21.952 --> 09:23.388
- Then why is it hidden
in the laundry room?

09:23.432 --> 09:25.042
- Where are those towels?
- Is this what you're doing?

09:25.086 --> 09:27.131
- Will you flush these?
- Are you making money?

09:28.132 --> 09:29.917
- Could I get that back?
- No.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.135
- What do you mean, no?

09:32.920 --> 09:34.835
- He didn't waste much time,
did he?

09:36.097 --> 09:37.446
- Dean--

09:37.489 --> 09:40.362
- How do you not see
what's happening here again?

09:40.405 --> 09:41.842
- It's different this time.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.583
- You're like the damn fish

09:43.626 --> 09:45.062
with a castle
thinking it's new.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.238
- You don't understand, okay?
- Oh, look, a castle.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.544
Oh, look, another castle.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.285
- Give it back to me!
- No!

09:57.031 --> 09:58.859
Don't.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.339
- We can't go back.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.906
- He's gonna kill me.

10:08.956 --> 10:11.088
- You don't kill
something you love.

10:37.724 --> 10:38.638
- Hey, Beth?

10:40.770 --> 10:42.380
Customer's here for you.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.385
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.589 --> 11:20.418
There's been a bit
of a snafu.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.596
- You don't say.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.775
- Press needed to be serviced.
- Mm-hmm.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.212
- So we couldn't make
your invitations.

11:31.255 --> 11:34.171
- It's more than a snafu.
- Well, you'll get them.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.347
It'll just be a little bit
of a delay.

11:39.394 --> 11:42.092
- See, here's the thing.
- I get it.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.660
- We don't do delays.
- I know.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.227
- And if that's what
I'm looking at here,

11:46.270 --> 11:48.446
then my boss has been pretty
clear on how to handle it.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.538
- What if I made it up to you?

11:57.107 --> 11:59.762
Like...

11:59.806 --> 12:01.633
not him but you?

12:05.115 --> 12:07.117
You mean if I wanted
my own invitations?

12:09.293 --> 12:11.774
- No event's too big.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.689
- It'd be a huge order.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.648
- Try me.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.261
- 100,000.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.488
- Easy peasy.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.578
- I'll hold him off
as long as I can.

12:38.801 --> 12:41.282
- Thanks again
for your understanding.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.545
- Which kind?
The super absorbent ones?

12:43.588 --> 12:46.287
- Uh, maybe just get
the variety pack.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.071
- It only gives you
eight of each.

12:48.115 --> 12:51.161
- Yeah, that should be fine.
- How heavy is your flow?

12:51.205 --> 12:53.598
- Like, medium.
- I'll get you options.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.818
What about pain relief?
How are your cramps?

12:55.862 --> 12:57.298
- Babe, I'm fine.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.343
- Oh, I'll pick up some Midol,
just to take off the edge.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.692
- Thank you.
That's very sweet.

13:00.736 --> 13:03.826
- Mm, oh, bubble bath
when I get back?

13:03.870 --> 13:05.219
- Only if you join me.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.873
both: Mm!

13:10.964 --> 13:12.574
- Isn't he awesome?

13:12.617 --> 13:14.837
- Like nothing I've ever seen.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.839
- Quite a catch.

13:16.883 --> 13:21.365
- So, um, remember that project
you did for us a while back?

13:22.802 --> 13:24.412
- Mm-hmm.

13:24.455 --> 13:25.935
- Well, you did
such a great job

13:25.979 --> 13:27.589
that we wanted
to hire you again.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.246
- Uh, what's the project
this time?

13:32.289 --> 13:36.250
- You're not gonna believe it.
- It's another casino night.

13:36.293 --> 13:39.253
- Uh, I can't.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.953
- We'll pay you more.
- That's not it.

13:43.997 --> 13:48.175
- I can cover you at work if
it's time that's an issue or--

13:48.218 --> 13:51.743
- I'm not comfortable doing
what you're asking me to do.

13:52.744 --> 13:54.877
- It's for a really good cause.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.975
- Gambling addicts, right?

14:13.765 --> 14:16.812
- I'm so sorry
I brought you into this.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.858
- Why did you?

14:21.338 --> 14:23.558
- Okay, well, let me
lay it out for you, Lucy.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.300
That piece of paper that you
found in the dumpster,

14:26.343 --> 14:28.780
shredded,
that's gonna be us.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.478
- Yeah, except you
won't be able

14:30.521 --> 14:32.262
to tape us back together again.

14:37.964 --> 14:41.141
- Hey, babe, I'm gonna
pick you up some pads too,

14:41.184 --> 14:42.925
'cause I know you hate leaving
those things in overnight.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.188
- I'll come with you.
- Oh, awesome.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.711
- Lucy.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.019
Please.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.283
- Just go.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.904
- He's so happy.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.778
- Why aren't you in bed?
- Shh. It's the finale.

15:09.821 --> 15:13.608
- Why isn't she in bed?
- Shh. America's voting.

15:13.651 --> 15:16.350
- She has school, Stan.
- It's just one night, baby.

15:16.393 --> 15:17.786
Um, tiny country guy
with the glasses?

15:17.829 --> 15:19.353
- No, old lady who raps.

15:19.396 --> 15:20.963
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.922
You should see
this old geezer rhyme.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.271
- Mom!
- Woman!

15:24.314 --> 15:26.708
- Bed--now.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.194
- What the hell's
got into you?

15:34.237 --> 15:35.935
- Close the door, Stanley.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.289
- You know, she finished
all her homework.

15:42.332 --> 15:43.986
- Oh, I know.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.466
Little heifer's
on the honor roll.

15:45.509 --> 15:46.902
She loves animals.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.426
She pops out of bed
for church.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.515
You know what else
our little angel does?

15:51.559 --> 15:54.779
She takes pens--
expensive ones.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.869
Yeah, she did it.

16:04.833 --> 16:05.965
I know.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.708
- You know what?
- She told me.

16:10.752 --> 16:13.059
- When?
- A while back.

16:14.669 --> 16:17.672
- And you're just cool with it?
- No, I'm not cool.

16:17.715 --> 16:20.892
- You're not not cool.
- You know what I am?

16:20.936 --> 16:22.111
I'm relieved.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.895
- The staying up late
and the cream cheese?

16:23.939 --> 16:25.636
- At least she was too guilty
to live with it.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.034
- What are you trying to say,
Stan?

16:36.082 --> 16:38.040
Come on, Ruby.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.740
- Wait, you're mad at me now?

16:45.613 --> 16:47.484
- When you lie,
you sleep like a queen.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.619
We're just lucky
she knows the difference.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.105
This is so wrong.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.718
- We gave her a chance.
- She doesn't deserve this.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.502
- Well, we tried asking nicely,

17:05.546 --> 17:08.070
so now it's either this
or the funeral home.

17:10.942 --> 17:14.424
- I want to make it very clear

17:14.468 --> 17:17.688
that we have hit a new low,
even for us,

17:17.732 --> 17:20.387
and once you cross over,
you don't come back the same.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.041
- Do it already.

17:25.305 --> 17:26.958
We've done worse.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.279
- What's it gonna be,
baby girl?

17:52.810 --> 17:54.116
Go.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.510
Go.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.342
- What if she kills him?

18:46.386 --> 18:48.039
- She can't.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.694
- Oh, believe me, she can.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.653
- He's no good to us dead.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.134
- I meant by accident.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.658
How much time do we have left?

18:57.701 --> 19:00.487
- I don't know.

19:00.530 --> 19:03.185
- What do you mean?
- I hit lap timer.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.579
- What's a lap timer?
- I don't know.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.802
- What if we add up
all the laps?

19:54.845 --> 19:56.151
- I'm afraid to stop it.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.892
- Lucy said he only power walks
for ten minutes.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.937
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.548
- It's okay.
It'll be fine.

20:01.591 --> 20:02.940
- No, it's not.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.551
Stan's gonna leave me.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.101
- Come on.
Why?

20:33.144 --> 20:35.625
- This.
Literally this.

20:35.669 --> 20:36.974
- Birds?
- Birds.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.715
Bodies.
Robberies.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.413
It's ruining our marriage.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.284
- He loves you.
He will get over it.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.068
He always does.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.202
- That's the thing.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.900
He's okay with it.

20:49.944 --> 20:52.033
This is who he thinks I am now.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.644
Oh, God.
- It'll be okay.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.211
- No, he's back.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.954
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.651
- Come on, girl.
Get out of there.

21:02.565 --> 21:03.914
Let's go, Annie.
Come on.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.179
- Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

21:08.223 --> 21:11.357
- Oh, goodness. Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?

21:22.237 --> 21:23.673
- Does she have it?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.336
- Drive.

21:35.859 --> 21:38.297
- Why didn't you take
the cage, Annie?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.516
- Just drive.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.398
- Uh, there are matching
envelopes in the back,

21:52.441 --> 21:53.747
if you need them.

21:57.272 --> 22:00.275
Hi there.
Welcome to the Paper Porcupine.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.668
I like your tattoo.

22:01.711 --> 22:04.758
- Oh, thank you.
- What does it mean?

22:04.801 --> 22:07.369
- Well, it's, uh, sort of
for this club that I'm in.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.805
- Cool.
Super cool.

22:10.067 --> 22:11.373
- I used to sling ink
to pay for art school.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.027
- Hmm.
- Slung ink. Slang?

22:13.070 --> 22:14.681
- I think it's slang.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.422
That's cool.
So you're an artist?

22:16.465 --> 22:18.467
- Yeah, I do all
the work design stuff here.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.991
Uh, custom orders,
stuff like that.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.689
- Oh.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.038
Wait, so you mean,
like,

22:24.081 --> 22:26.214
if someone wanted
something special printed,

22:26.257 --> 22:27.389
you would draw it?

22:27.433 --> 22:29.435
- But you'd pick the paper,
the colors.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.262
- Yeah, but you'd draw it?

22:31.306 --> 22:33.526
- Yeah, and then we'd make
an engraver's plate

22:33.569 --> 22:36.224
and print it all on-site.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.008
- Cool.
- Yeah.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.183
- Cool, cool, cool.

22:39.227 --> 22:42.491
- Yeah, uh, one-stop shop.
- Yeah.

22:42.535 --> 22:45.059
You know, that's good,
'cause I'm, um--

22:45.102 --> 22:48.628
I'd really like to get rid
of the person I'm using now.

22:48.671 --> 22:49.542
- Really?

22:49.585 --> 22:52.283
- Yeah, not so reliable.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.373
- Well, won't happen
on my watch.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.723
Just let me know if I can help.

22:56.766 --> 23:00.814
- Actually, Lucy,
I think you can.

23:08.169 --> 23:10.040
- Hey.
How was school?

23:16.307 --> 23:17.744
That good, huh?

23:17.787 --> 23:19.702
- You're mental.

23:19.746 --> 23:20.834
- What?

23:22.444 --> 23:23.967
Oh, wait, hey, uh, wait.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.926
Uh, hey, dah-dah-dah!

23:25.969 --> 23:27.971
Don't go in there!
- I can't go in the bathroom?

23:28.015 --> 23:31.497
- You can, but--

23:31.540 --> 23:33.281
- Your boyfriend just asked me
for toilet paper.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.283
- Who?
- Chris, Kevin?

23:35.326 --> 23:37.154
- Ugh, Kevin.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.939
- He's outside in his car.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.636
- Oh, God.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.072
- He said he wants
to live closer to you

23:42.116 --> 23:44.597
now that you guys are dating.
- We are not dating.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.208
- He's living on our curb.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.905
- He's going through something.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.341
- You said you were done
with this.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.343
- He's homeless!
- You're an addict!

23:52.387 --> 23:53.649
- Ben, Ben!

23:53.693 --> 23:55.129
- We study people like you
in psych class.

23:55.172 --> 23:56.478
- Ben, Ben, Ben!

23:57.914 --> 24:00.264
- What the hell?

24:02.179 --> 24:03.833
It's not mine.

24:12.015 --> 24:15.454
- I don't understand anything
that's going on here.

24:19.370 --> 24:20.981
- His name's Au Jus.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.679
- Give this to your boyfriend.

24:28.423 --> 24:29.816
- Oh, my God.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.342
- Damn.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.039
- Yeah.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.172
- Yeah, I tried to get one
with his head

24:38.215 --> 24:40.957
actually in the disposal, but--
- Oh, Jesus.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.742
- I didn't do it.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.179
He freaked out every time
I turned him upside down.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.181
- How'd you even take these?

24:47.224 --> 24:49.009
- Ben's selfie stick.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.054
- Are we supposed
to show all of these

24:51.098 --> 24:52.621
or just choose the best one?

24:52.665 --> 24:54.144
- The one
with the carving knife.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.668
- See, I don't buy that one.

24:55.711 --> 24:58.018
- Well, sorry,
Ansel Adams.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.237
- What don't you buy?
- I don't know.

25:00.281 --> 25:01.978
Maybe if it was, like,
scissors or something.

25:02.022 --> 25:05.025
It's just not believable.

25:05.068 --> 25:06.635
Well, here,
just scroll to the end.

25:06.679 --> 25:07.984
I did, like, a whole thing
with the microwave and tinfoil.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.508
- Let's just stick
with the disposal.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.857
She's gonna cave.

25:12.336 --> 25:13.512
- Okay.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.517
- If you hold the phone,
then I can do the talking.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.344
That's all I'm saying.
- It's your phone.

25:20.388 --> 25:21.607
- How am I gonna hold the phone
and do the talking--

25:21.650 --> 25:23.043
- I already had to kidnap
a freaking bird.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.044
I'm not doing it.

25:28.439 --> 25:29.484
- What's up, ladies?

25:52.812 --> 25:54.683
- How we doing, champ?

25:54.727 --> 25:57.164
- My hand keeps shaking.
- Yeah?

25:57.207 --> 25:59.688
It's okay.

25:59.732 --> 26:03.344
Just take your time.
There's no rush.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.954
- She doesn't need
to be involved.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.914
- Oh, 'cause you can do this?

26:07.957 --> 26:10.656
How about you two?

26:10.699 --> 26:12.440
- No.
- I have the software.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.877
- No?

26:14.921 --> 26:17.445
All this time, I thought you

26:17.488 --> 26:18.925
were the one doing
the heavy lifting.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.187
- Just let her go.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.189
- And here you are
stealing my girl's thunder.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.019
Ain't bitches supposed
to be, like,

26:26.062 --> 26:27.586
lifting each other up
these days?

26:27.629 --> 26:31.198
- So much for feminism.

26:33.766 --> 26:36.203
Maybe you don't need
to be involved.

26:38.814 --> 26:42.209
- Hello! Lucy!

26:44.167 --> 26:45.647
- It's Mrs. Harris.

26:45.691 --> 26:48.389
I told her I'd stay late
so she could pick up her order.

26:48.432 --> 26:50.391
- Go tell Mrs. Harris
that we're closed, okay?

26:51.827 --> 26:53.568
- Okay.
- Okay?

26:53.612 --> 26:54.830
- Yeah.

27:00.706 --> 27:01.881
- Go with her.

27:08.017 --> 27:12.369
Oh, and...be smart, yeah?

27:18.288 --> 27:20.073
- Oh, my God.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.510
They're almost too beautiful
to send.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.947
- Wish Henry
a happy retirement for us.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.689
- Now, what do you have
in the way of place cards?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.952
- Uh, we're all out, actually.
- What are these?

27:29.996 --> 27:32.781
It says place cards.
Oh, boy.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.261
What do you think
would go best?

27:34.304 --> 27:35.523
- Blue plaid.

27:35.566 --> 27:38.091
- Okay, but the invitations
are red.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.179
Should we--
- Uh, red gingham.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.007
Right here.

27:41.050 --> 27:44.401
- Oh!
These are perfect!

27:44.445 --> 27:46.969
All right, now, should I just
give you the guest list?

27:47.013 --> 27:47.927
- Uh-huh.
- Yep.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.102
- Okay, great.

27:49.145 --> 27:51.060
Um, definitely
the entire office.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.235
We'll start there.

27:52.279 --> 27:54.890
Uh, Bob,

27:54.934 --> 27:56.892
uh, George,

27:56.936 --> 27:59.634
uh, Troy,
Stanley...

28:00.853 --> 28:04.030
Richard, Ellen, Hakim...

28:04.073 --> 28:05.727
- All right,
I love you, babe.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.816
Good night, sweetie pie.
Good night, bug.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.426
I'll see you in the morning,
okay?

28:12.038 --> 28:13.387
- Daddy?

28:15.737 --> 28:16.695
- Yeah?

28:18.609 --> 28:20.307
- When do Reddy, Bluey,
and Greeny

28:20.350 --> 28:22.875
get back
from the fish hospital?

28:22.918 --> 28:23.919
- Hmm.

28:25.181 --> 28:26.313
W--

28:27.270 --> 28:29.882
It turns out...

28:29.925 --> 28:30.883
that...

28:36.584 --> 28:39.369
The fish doctors discovered
they have superpowers.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.416
- Really?

28:42.459 --> 28:44.897
- Yeah, and they were accepted

28:44.940 --> 28:48.814
at a very special
fish magic school.

28:48.857 --> 28:51.817
It's half "X-Men,"
half "Harry Potter,"

28:51.860 --> 28:54.384
but it's top secret,
so we can't see them

28:54.428 --> 28:56.560
or visit
for a really long time.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.781
- Kenny said you flushed them.

29:02.828 --> 29:03.742
- Huh.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.440
- He saw you do it.

29:08.529 --> 29:11.053
- Well, yeah, that's how
you get to the fish school.

29:11.097 --> 29:12.881
The toilet is the portal.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.237
- Can we get a different pet?

29:21.281 --> 29:23.326
- Fish smell.

29:24.327 --> 29:28.679
- Yolanda, Javier, Esme...

29:30.159 --> 29:32.945
Hannah, and Tom.

29:32.988 --> 29:35.425
Should I just wait for these?
- Friday.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.123
- Friday. Perfect.

29:37.166 --> 29:39.386
Thank you.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.349
- You cannot finish that plate.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.874
- He said he'd let me go.
- He won't.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.353
Trust me.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.051
- Can I ask you a question?

29:52.094 --> 29:54.009
Like, as a friend?

29:56.185 --> 29:58.492
How could you take Au Jus?

30:00.581 --> 30:03.018
- I am in
a real situation here.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.457
But I promise you,

30:07.501 --> 30:11.418
I would never,
ever hurt him.

30:14.029 --> 30:17.032
- Why would I believe
anything you say anymore?

30:20.383 --> 30:22.429
All done.

30:22.472 --> 30:24.866
Um, feel free
to email me any questions,

30:24.910 --> 30:27.651
but it's all on there.
- Cool.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.611
- Uh, GraphicFarts89@gmail.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.656
I, um--I spelt it wrong

30:32.700 --> 30:34.876
and then, uh,
got stuck with it.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.183
- Come on.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.706
We'll give you a ride.

30:39.707 --> 30:42.101
- We can walk.
- We have a car.

30:47.149 --> 30:48.585
- Let's go.

31:00.249 --> 31:01.424
All right, rock star.

31:01.468 --> 31:02.599
We'll drop you off
wherever you want.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.514
Least we could do.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.907
- Lucy, don't.

31:09.389 --> 31:10.825
Here's the thing.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.827
I've been doing this
a long time.

31:14.350 --> 31:17.223
The only way someone like you
gets hurt is if you talk.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.224
You're not gonna talk, right?

31:18.267 --> 31:19.616
- No.
- I got your word?

31:19.660 --> 31:20.791
- Cross my heart.

31:22.489 --> 31:24.317
- Then you'll never
see me again.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.059
Unless I got questions
about that plate, yeah?

31:27.102 --> 31:28.582
- GraphicFarts89@gmail.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.236
- Ah.

31:30.279 --> 31:31.759
My girl.

31:33.587 --> 31:35.110
All right, who's next?

31:35.154 --> 31:37.678
- Wait.
Wait!

31:37.721 --> 31:39.810
What kind of packing are you
gonna put on the plates?

31:40.986 --> 31:41.987
- What?

31:45.816 --> 31:47.949
- What if the press
gets too hot?

31:49.864 --> 31:52.127
- Not your problem
anymore, is it?

31:52.998 --> 31:55.609
- How you gonna stop
ghost marks on the rollers?

31:56.392 --> 31:59.830
What happens if you get slur
with the half tones?

32:02.485 --> 32:04.792
It means your ink's too thin.

32:04.835 --> 32:06.925
So even with a perfect plate,

32:06.968 --> 32:09.144
it's gonna look like
your son made it.

32:12.104 --> 32:15.107
How long did it take you
to get the security glow?

32:15.150 --> 32:17.239
- Um, a while.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.941
- You think they sell
that color at Home Depot?

32:27.249 --> 32:30.122
What if you add too much water
to the mulch?

32:30.165 --> 32:33.516
- Starch builds up.
- And why don't we like that?

32:33.560 --> 32:34.648
Why don't we like that?

32:34.691 --> 32:36.128
- Because the paper
won't feel right.

32:36.171 --> 32:38.739
You wouldn't even be able
to pass it off at a bodega.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.742
- Just because she gave you
a cookbook

32:41.785 --> 32:43.396
to a five-star restaurant

32:43.439 --> 32:45.964
doesn't mean you
can make the dishes.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.879
You need the chef.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.708
You need us.
You need all of us.

33:00.195 --> 33:02.284
- Nah.

33:05.635 --> 33:07.202
- No?

33:14.166 --> 33:15.645
- Not all of you.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.964
- What?
- We gotta do this.

35:41.008 --> 35:42.444
- Now?
- Get up.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.098
- All right.
I'm up.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.578
I'm up.

35:46.405 --> 35:49.408
- I'm not a lost cause.
- What are you talking about?

35:49.451 --> 35:51.061
- When you look at me,

35:51.105 --> 35:52.715
I don't know
who you see anymore.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.717
- I see my wife.
- You can't leave me.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.023
- She's acting crazy
in the middle of the night.

35:56.066 --> 35:57.503
- That's how it happens,
you know?

35:57.546 --> 35:59.592
It--it's not any big thing.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.898
You just wake up one day
and you stop caring

36:01.942 --> 36:04.162
that I don't put the remote
back in the same spot

36:04.205 --> 36:05.815
'cause you just got used
to looking for it.

36:05.859 --> 36:06.816
- Well, who says
I'm used to it?

36:06.860 --> 36:07.861
I couldn't watch
anything tonight.

36:07.904 --> 36:10.733
- Marriages don't end, Stanley.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.649
They fade little by little.
- Okay, come here.

36:13.693 --> 36:15.216
- You don't even
see it happening...

36:15.260 --> 36:17.784
Until it's over.

36:17.827 --> 36:21.222
- Get in here.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.315
Mm, tell me
where that remote is,

36:27.359 --> 36:28.708
and we're good forever.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.148
- Just don't give up on me.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.622
- Mm.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.016
- What are you doing?

37:18.845 --> 37:20.499
Can I sleep with you?

37:21.674 --> 37:23.676
- Aren't I kinda old for this?

37:25.982 --> 37:27.027
- Please?

37:32.685 --> 37:34.774
- Jordan called an Uber
from the mall

37:34.817 --> 37:36.558
and Chris-Kevin picked her up.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.647
- Oh, no.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.170
- She rode home
in his living room.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.263
I'll get rid of him.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.617
- I'm still mad at you.

37:53.706 --> 37:56.186
- Don't be.

37:56.230 --> 37:57.884
Not tonight.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.850
- Can we get rid
of the bird too?

38:07.894 --> 38:09.939
It's nesting in the bath mat.

38:27.783 --> 38:29.219
- Who's that little guy?

38:33.920 --> 38:36.401
- Meet Dorito Boland.

38:36.444 --> 38:39.317
When did you buy a bird?

38:42.798 --> 38:44.713
- He's a rescue.

38:44.757 --> 38:46.367
- You tell the kids yet?

38:47.890 --> 38:48.978
- I thought we could
surprise them

38:49.022 --> 38:50.763
together after school today.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.640
- I wasn't trying
to make things worse.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.862
- I know.

39:02.905 --> 39:05.995
- I just--I really hate you
being around that guy again.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.259
- Me too.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.175
- Really?

39:18.965 --> 39:20.793
So what happened?
Was he pissed?

39:26.102 --> 39:27.756
- Yeah.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.019
- I told you he won't
kill something he loves.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.549
- It's not me, though.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.115
- What is it?

39:39.159 --> 39:40.639
- Money.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.165
- Mm.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.822
How long's this guy
gonna be around?

39:51.345 --> 39:54.870
- Um...about 50 years.

39:56.002 --> 39:57.612
We'll have to put him
in our will.

40:00.267 --> 40:01.790
He's cute.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.829
- Beth?

40:42.309 --> 40:45.878
- Hey.
- Have you heard from Lucy?

40:47.445 --> 40:48.750
- She's off today.
Why?

40:48.794 --> 40:51.405
- Uh, she didn't
come home last night.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.234
- What?

40:54.277 --> 40:57.280
- Yeah, cops say it's too early
to do anything.

40:57.324 --> 40:59.805
I--

40:59.848 --> 41:01.850
- Maybe she's with friends.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.504
- Oh, she didn't
really have friends.

41:03.548 --> 41:04.723
Except for you.

41:09.336 --> 41:12.034
- Well, keep trying her.
I'm sure she's fine.

41:36.102 --> 41:37.712
If you hear from her
or anything like--

41:37.756 --> 41:38.887
- Of course.
