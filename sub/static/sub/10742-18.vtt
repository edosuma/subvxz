   I sent Jeannie home.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.361
   I don't know what to say.

24:24.397 --> 24:25.829
                 They told me
              I'd find you here.

24:25.864 --> 24:26.930
Sheila, where--?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.231
          Isn't it beautiful?

24:28.267 --> 24:29.667
                 It's beautiful.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.101
            Captain Healey
          bought it for me.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.804
   Captain, are you prepared
     to pay for that coat?

24:33.839 --> 24:35.238
   Uh, how much did it cost?

24:35.274 --> 24:36.373
     Five thousand dollars.

24:36.409 --> 24:38.909
          [MUTTERING]
        Five thousand...

24:41.447 --> 24:43.681
          Five thousand dollars,
           at exactly $10 a week

24:43.716 --> 24:46.149
              would make $100...
