WEBVTT

00:11.137 --> 00:12.551
- Don't you just love
the holidays?

00:12.655 --> 00:14.034
- The only holiday
I respect is Mother's Day,

00:14.137 --> 00:15.448
'cause I feel
directly responsible

00:15.551 --> 00:17.620
for my mother's pain.
- You do have a huge head.

00:17.724 --> 00:20.344
I'll bet your birthday
causes your mom PTSD.

00:20.448 --> 00:22.413
- Maybe I'll just get
Kate and John gift cards.

00:22.517 --> 00:23.827
- You're asking for a promotion.

00:23.931 --> 00:25.517
You gotta get 'em something
better than a gift card.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.137
- No way.
Gift cards are the perfect way

00:27.241 --> 00:28.344
to show someone
you don't care about

00:28.448 --> 00:29.965
that you really care about them.

00:30.068 --> 00:31.413
Wait, you're getting reimbursed

00:31.517 --> 00:32.827
for the decorations
for the office party, right?

00:32.931 --> 00:33.965
- No, but it's fine.

00:34.068 --> 00:37.000
- Okay, that'll be $837.98.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.931
- Jesus! Fucking.
Fuck you.

00:39.034 --> 00:40.517
What! Whoa!

00:40.620 --> 00:42.379
Okay.

00:42.482 --> 00:44.551
- Sir, if you're not gonna
buy that, please put it down.

00:44.655 --> 00:47.448
- Wow, just some more casual
anti-Semitism thrown in my face.

00:47.551 --> 00:49.275
- I don't like him, either.

00:49.379 --> 00:51.448
- Holiday gift giving
is bullshit forced generosity.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.689
If I get gifts for people,

00:52.793 --> 00:53.862
I'm just doing
what I'm supposed to.

00:53.965 --> 00:55.620
If I don't get gifts for people,
I'm an asshole

00:55.724 --> 00:57.586
for not participating in
a made-up corporate holiday.

00:57.689 --> 00:59.137
It's a trap,
and I'm a victim.

00:59.241 --> 01:00.724
- No, holidays are good.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.517
They're your one chance
to make up for being

01:02.620 --> 01:04.758
a huge disappointment
the rest of the year.

01:04.862 --> 01:06.620
- Make this
a September to remember

01:06.724 --> 01:08.482
by getting twin
touch screen Obelisks

01:08.586 --> 01:10.137
for the price of one.

01:14.482 --> 01:17.275
- I don't know.
Something about Remember Day

01:17.379 --> 01:18.689
just leaves a bad taste
in my mouth.

01:40.310 --> 01:42.655
- Yesterday
will always be remembered

01:42.758 --> 01:46.482
as a somber day
in American history.

01:46.586 --> 01:51.206
Now more than ever,
Americans need to shop

01:51.310 --> 01:54.172
at Hampton Deville
affiliated stores.

01:54.275 --> 01:56.758
We have a moral duty
as a company

01:56.862 --> 01:58.413
to monetize this tragedy,

01:58.517 --> 02:00.413
because if we don't,

02:00.517 --> 02:03.551
the terrorists win.

02:05.241 --> 02:07.413
- Excuse me, Christian?

02:07.517 --> 02:08.551
We have an idea.

02:11.793 --> 02:15.206
Why do people
celebrate Christmas?

02:15.310 --> 02:16.758
- Trauma.

02:16.862 --> 02:19.172
Americans fight through hell
all year,

02:19.275 --> 02:21.965
and to reward themselves
at the end of it,

02:22.068 --> 02:23.310
they buy gifts.

02:23.413 --> 02:25.241
- Hallmark invented
Valentine's Day;

02:25.344 --> 02:27.241
Walmart invented
the Fourth of July;

02:27.344 --> 02:28.344
and Harbor Day,
as we all know,

02:28.448 --> 02:31.413
was invented by Carl's Jr.
- Carl's Jr.

02:31.517 --> 02:34.344
- So we think it's time
for Hampton DeVille

02:34.448 --> 02:36.862
to create its own holiday.

02:39.448 --> 02:40.896
- What are your names?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.310
- Kate.
- Shawn.

02:44.413 --> 02:46.689
- Kate and John...

02:46.793 --> 02:48.689
- Oh--

02:48.793 --> 02:49.931
- That's...

02:50.034 --> 02:51.896
an excellent idea.

02:54.413 --> 02:57.310
2000 years ago,
Jesus Christ was crucified,

02:57.413 --> 02:59.413
and now every Easter,
people buy

02:59.517 --> 03:02.000
millions of dollars
worth of chocolate bunnies.

03:02.103 --> 03:04.172
Starting today,
we are going to plant the seeds

03:04.275 --> 03:05.413
for a new holiday.

03:05.517 --> 03:07.344
We just have to wait
until the time is right.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.241
This can't feel opportunistic.

03:09.344 --> 03:10.862
It has to come
straight from the heart.

03:10.965 --> 03:11.862
I'm thinking...

03:14.275 --> 03:17.379
20 years seems appropriate.

03:19.482 --> 03:22.310
both: It's Remember Day!

03:24.241 --> 03:27.517
- In studio with us today,
we have Hampton DeVille CEO,

03:27.620 --> 03:28.862
Christian DeVille.

03:28.965 --> 03:30.862
both: Hey, Christian.
- It's great to be here.

03:30.965 --> 03:32.310
You know,
I'm a big fan of the show.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.413
- Ooh!
- Cheers.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.103
- Ch-ching, ch-ching.
- Yay.

03:35.206 --> 03:38.344
- Fun fact: Hampton DeVille
actually coined the phrase,

03:38.448 --> 03:41.620
"Remember Day,"
so I guess that kinda makes you

03:41.724 --> 03:44.310
the Santa Claus
of this holiday.

03:44.413 --> 03:46.034
-  I like that.
- So Hampton DeVille

03:46.137 --> 03:49.241
cares about all Americans,
and wants to give back.

03:49.344 --> 03:50.896
That's why you'll find
great deals

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
on all Hampton DeVille
products today.

03:53.103 --> 03:54.103
And with every purchase,

03:54.206 --> 03:56.551
you'll receive
a red Remember Day string,

03:56.655 --> 03:58.413
and we suggest you tie it
around your finger

03:58.517 --> 04:01.137
to help you to remember.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.241
- If I have any more white wine,
I won't remember anything.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.931
- I might black out.

04:06.034 --> 04:08.137
- Okay, let's go
a pinch more to the right.

04:08.241 --> 04:09.586
No, to the right.

04:09.689 --> 04:11.655
And...
- Whoops.

04:11.758 --> 04:13.275
- Grace...
- Matt, chill out.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.551
This is an office holiday party

04:14.655 --> 04:17.000
for a bunch of bosses
and employees

04:17.103 --> 04:19.310
who make fun of you in email
threads behind your back.

04:19.413 --> 04:20.931
- My coworkers are my family.

04:21.034 --> 04:22.965
I know that, because
they constantly mistreat me,

04:23.068 --> 04:24.482
and I desperately need
their approval.

04:24.586 --> 04:26.275
- Hey, so what's the deal
with the elephant?

04:26.379 --> 04:28.000
- It's the Remember Day
Memory Elephant.

04:28.103 --> 04:29.241
It helps you never forget.

04:29.344 --> 04:31.448
But wait, it's supposed to be
red, white, and blue.

04:31.551 --> 04:33.689
- Uh, the store only had
grey elephants,

04:33.793 --> 04:35.586
because that's the color
that elephants are.

04:35.689 --> 04:37.620
- Okay, well, I don't have time
for your excuses.

04:37.724 --> 04:39.000
The party starts in two hours,

04:39.103 --> 04:40.724
so I need you to go get
some art supplies

04:40.827 --> 04:41.862
and paint that elephant
American.

04:41.965 --> 04:44.827
- Jeez, why is this
so important to you?

04:44.931 --> 04:47.586
- Why is this
so important to you?

04:47.689 --> 04:50.724
- Because, Roger, you forgot to
buy the Christmas ham.

04:50.827 --> 04:52.103
That was our Christmas dinner.

04:52.206 --> 04:54.413
Without it, we don't have
Christmas, so good job!

04:54.517 --> 04:56.275
- Oh, don't go
blaming this on me.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.551
- Would you keep
your voice down?

04:57.655 --> 04:59.103
I don't want Matt to hear you.

04:59.206 --> 05:00.413
- I want him to hear us.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.068
Ever since
he's moved back in here,

05:02.172 --> 05:03.793
our marriage has been
falling apart!

05:03.896 --> 05:06.448
- Well, you know what I want
for Christmas? A divorce!

05:06.551 --> 05:08.758
- Well, ho, ho, ho,
and call me Santa Claus,

05:08.862 --> 05:10.344
because I'm giving you
your wish.

05:10.448 --> 05:11.517
- Matt?

05:11.620 --> 05:13.344
What were you just
thinking about?

05:13.448 --> 05:15.724
- Nothing.
All I know is that

05:15.827 --> 05:18.551
holidays hold the potential
to ruin lives,

05:18.655 --> 05:20.655
and I won't let that
happen today.

05:20.758 --> 05:24.517
- Okay, whatever,
I'll go paint the elephant.

05:24.620 --> 05:26.241
Thank you, Paige.

05:29.482 --> 05:31.000
Grace, higher.

05:31.103 --> 05:33.206
- Matt, I'm short,
you tall monster.

05:33.310 --> 05:34.551
- Okay, I'll do it then.

05:34.655 --> 05:35.931
- Coming up after the break,

05:36.034 --> 05:38.862
we've got a celebrity chef,
Theresa Marticinni.

05:38.965 --> 05:41.103
She's gonna be making us
traditional Remember Day goose.

05:43.793 --> 05:44.896
- Thank you, Christian!
- Toodles.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.068
- My pleasure.

05:46.172 --> 05:51.068
- Let me just get this mic
off of you real quick.

05:51.172 --> 05:52.413
And while I got you here,

05:52.517 --> 05:55.862
I just want you know, I think
you're a sick piece of shit.

05:55.965 --> 05:58.413
- Excuse me?

05:58.517 --> 05:59.758
Do you know
who you're speaking to?

05:59.862 --> 06:01.965
- Yeah, a sick piece of shit,
who's totally comfortable

06:02.068 --> 06:04.103
exploiting emotionally
vulnerable people

06:04.206 --> 06:05.448
to get a quick buck.

06:05.551 --> 06:08.758
Fuck you, Santa Claus.

06:08.862 --> 06:11.344
How do you live with yourself?

06:22.344 --> 06:24.586
-  Kate...

06:24.689 --> 06:27.068
Hey, Kate.
- I'm right here.

06:28.827 --> 06:31.172
- Did you get
your Remember Day bonus yet?

06:31.275 --> 06:33.793
- No.
Did you?

06:33.896 --> 06:35.103
- You don't think he's forgotten

06:35.206 --> 06:36.931
that this holiday
was our idea, do you?

06:37.034 --> 06:39.517
- On Remember Day?

06:39.620 --> 06:41.000
Okay, Jake,
you're gonna go in there,

06:41.103 --> 06:43.413
and be confident and direct,
and exude raw sexual energy,

06:43.517 --> 06:45.862
which nobody can deny.
Let's go.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.758
Oh, my God, perfect.
You're both here.

06:49.862 --> 06:53.551
First of all,
Happy Remember Day.

06:53.655 --> 06:56.655
- Aww, thank you, Jake.
- Aww.

06:56.758 --> 06:58.000
- I'll get straight
to the point.

06:58.103 --> 07:00.172
Listen, I've been
a Junior Executive in Training

07:00.275 --> 07:01.344
for about five years now,

07:01.448 --> 07:03.482
and it's technically
a one-year program,

07:03.586 --> 07:05.586
so wow.

07:05.689 --> 07:07.000
Anyway, I am all trained up,

07:07.103 --> 07:09.413
and I'm ready to be
a Junior Executive.

07:09.517 --> 07:10.827
As my mentors,

07:10.931 --> 07:13.137
promoting me would be
a huge win for both of you.

07:13.241 --> 07:15.793
I'm your Shamu,
you're my SeaWorld,

07:15.896 --> 07:17.620
and let's just pretend
Blackfish never happened.

07:17.724 --> 07:19.344
Who cares about whales?
I don't.

07:19.448 --> 07:20.896
- First of all, Jake,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.551
we're surprised it took you
this long to ask.

07:23.655 --> 07:27.413
- Unfortunately,
the answer is no.

07:27.517 --> 07:28.586
- Jake, here are the reasons

07:28.689 --> 07:30.034
you will not be getting
this promotion.

07:30.137 --> 07:31.793
You come into work
with cat hair on your suit.

07:31.896 --> 07:33.137
- So much cat hair
that I'm sometimes like,

07:33.241 --> 07:34.517
"What's going on here?"
- What's going on?

07:34.620 --> 07:35.551
What's happening?

07:35.655 --> 07:37.862
- Unfortunately,
the answer is no.

07:37.965 --> 07:40.034
We're not gonna sign you
to our record label.

07:40.137 --> 07:42.000
And can I give you some advice?

07:42.103 --> 07:44.068
- No.
I'm here to rock.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.827
The music industry
has gone corporate.

07:45.931 --> 07:48.172
Fuck corporate America.

07:48.275 --> 07:50.482
Two, three, four.

07:50.586 --> 07:52.965
♪ America is a corporation

07:53.068 --> 07:56.034
♪ And I hate
my supportive parents ♪

07:56.137 --> 07:58.931
♪ North Korea
is better than America ♪

07:59.034 --> 08:02.034
♪ And I can't pay
my student loans ♪

08:02.137 --> 08:04.827
- And Baron showed us
a video of your rap rock band,

08:04.931 --> 08:06.034
so there's that.
- Yikes.

08:06.137 --> 08:08.793
- Quite frankly,
you're lucky to even have a job.

08:08.896 --> 08:10.344
-  ♪ Gift card
- Wow.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.275
- How much is on it?

08:15.137 --> 08:15.827
- All right, just wanna
double-check we have everything.

08:15.931 --> 08:17.724
We've got Remember Nog;

08:17.827 --> 08:19.862
Paige painted the elephant;

08:19.965 --> 08:23.172
and you got the Remember--
- Grace, I got it, okay?

08:23.275 --> 08:25.827
I'm not gonna screw this up.
- I'm gonna screw you up!

08:25.931 --> 08:27.448
I hate this bullshit holiday--

08:31.068 --> 08:32.068
- Be careful up there.

08:36.206 --> 08:38.758
- Hi, Dad--I mean, Mr. DeVille.

08:38.862 --> 08:41.482
Happy Remember Day.
- Thank you.

08:41.586 --> 08:44.413
Can I ask you a question, uh...

08:44.517 --> 08:46.586
- Matt.
- Pat...

08:46.689 --> 08:49.310
what do you think about
this holiday?

08:49.413 --> 08:50.724
- I love it.

08:50.827 --> 08:52.724
Christmas kinda
got ruined for me,

08:52.827 --> 08:55.172
so this holiday
means a lot to me.

08:55.275 --> 08:58.275
I mean, I went
into a $1,000 credit card debt

08:58.379 --> 09:00.000
buying all the decorations
for this party,

09:00.103 --> 09:02.241
but that's what it's
all about, right?

09:02.344 --> 09:04.275
- Honestly, Pat,

09:04.379 --> 09:07.034
I don't know
what it's all about anymore.

09:07.137 --> 09:09.241
This morning, someone made me
think about this holiday

09:09.344 --> 09:10.931
a little differently,
and now...

09:11.034 --> 09:15.172
Quite frankly...

09:15.275 --> 09:17.689
I'm spinning out of control...

09:17.793 --> 09:18.586
emotionally.

09:18.689 --> 09:21.724
- Oh, well,

09:21.827 --> 09:23.310
you should come to
the party later.

09:23.413 --> 09:25.551
I planned the whole thing.
We're gonna have Remember Nog.

09:25.655 --> 09:28.517
- Maybe I'll stop by.

09:30.517 --> 09:31.482
- Oh, and we're cooking

09:31.586 --> 09:33.413
a traditional
Remember Day goose, so...

09:36.517 --> 09:37.379
Goose...

09:43.689 --> 09:47.172
Oh, holy Christ in heaven,
I forgot the goose.

09:52.068 --> 09:53.965
- So I asked for that promotion,
and guess what?

09:54.068 --> 09:55.241
- Jake, I don't have time
for you right now, okay?

09:55.344 --> 09:57.379
I have to redeem my father--
I mean, Christian.

09:57.482 --> 09:59.827
Listen, stop questioning me
right now, okay?

09:59.931 --> 10:02.413
All I know is
I need to get a goose.

10:09.137 --> 10:12.551
- This Remember Day,
show her you really care

10:12.655 --> 10:14.931
by giving her the gift
she'll always remember

10:15.034 --> 10:16.482
and never forget,

10:16.586 --> 10:19.172
because she won't be able
to stop remembering.

10:19.275 --> 10:21.862
- Here you go.
Next!

10:21.965 --> 10:23.448
- Listen,
I know it's last minute,

10:23.551 --> 10:24.793
but I need a goose.

10:24.896 --> 10:27.103
- You gotta be
a real fucking idiot

10:27.206 --> 10:29.896
not to order a goose
before Remember Day.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.931
What are you? A grade-A bozo?

10:33.034 --> 10:34.965
You got spaghetti
and meatballs for brains?

10:35.068 --> 10:37.241
Did you get dropped as a child?

10:37.344 --> 10:39.103
Or did God just think
it would be funny

10:39.206 --> 10:43.103
to put mashed fucking potatoes
in your skull?

10:43.206 --> 10:45.241
- What's happening right now?
- Doesn't matter.

10:45.344 --> 10:48.310
That old lady got
the last goose.

10:48.413 --> 10:49.965
You fucking idiot!

10:50.068 --> 10:53.068
Get a life, you fucking moron!
- Excuse me...

10:53.172 --> 10:55.000
Excuse me, miss,
I'm sorry to bother you,

10:55.103 --> 10:58.034
and this is gonna sound crazy,
but I need that goose.

10:58.137 --> 10:59.586
- I've got a Taser.

10:59.689 --> 11:02.724
- Okay, uh, well, uh, listen,
I'll--I'll buy it off you.

11:02.827 --> 11:04.137
I'll--I'll give you $200.

11:04.241 --> 11:05.758
- Fuck you.
Go to rehab.

11:05.862 --> 11:07.551
- Okay, ey--hey, excuse me.
Listen to me.

11:07.655 --> 11:08.655
Listen to me, I'm sorry,

11:08.758 --> 11:11.310
but this is really
important to me.

11:11.413 --> 11:12.758
It's Remember Day,

11:12.862 --> 11:14.931
and as Americans, we need to
learn to come together more...

11:15.034 --> 11:17.241
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- And just really--hey!

11:17.344 --> 11:19.000
Hold on!
Ow!

11:19.103 --> 11:21.241
God, you didn't have to do--

11:25.275 --> 11:27.655
- I'll never forget where I was
when I found out.

11:27.758 --> 11:31.241
I was eating a bacon, egg,
and cheese croissant in my car.

11:31.344 --> 11:33.137
I was so upset,
I couldn't even finish it.

11:33.241 --> 11:34.793
- Hm.

11:34.896 --> 11:36.448
- I lied.

11:36.551 --> 11:38.034
I totally finished it.

11:38.137 --> 11:39.965
But I felt bad.

11:40.068 --> 11:42.241
I think the mayo was expired.

11:42.344 --> 11:44.862
- I was actually, like,

11:44.965 --> 11:46.586
dead in the middle
of losing my virginity

11:46.689 --> 11:48.862
when it all happened.

11:48.965 --> 11:50.241
Yeah, the news came on the TV,

11:50.344 --> 11:51.620
and, well, long story short,

11:51.724 --> 11:56.793
uh, I've had a lot of
sexual problems ever since...

11:56.896 --> 11:59.448
- Hm.
- So...

11:59.551 --> 12:00.724
- What about you, Paige?

12:00.827 --> 12:03.068
- Oh, I actually can't remember
where I was that day.

12:03.172 --> 12:06.965
- How's that possible?
- I was six years old.

12:07.068 --> 12:09.827
- Fuck you.
- Hm.

12:11.413 --> 12:12.655
- Hey, Jake, what's wrong?

12:12.758 --> 12:15.206
Besides everything
that's happening around us.

12:15.310 --> 12:17.275
- Oh, I don't know, let's see.

12:17.379 --> 12:19.137
I've worked here for five years,
can't get a promotion.

12:19.241 --> 12:22.206
Nobody here cares about me,

12:22.310 --> 12:24.241
not even Matt.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.758
My cat stopped
sleeping in bed with me,

12:25.862 --> 12:28.517
and I can't figure out why,
and it's destroying me!

12:30.206 --> 12:32.965
So in summary,
I think I'm gonna quit.

12:36.379 --> 12:37.862
- Whoops.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.103
Totally should've
said something there.

12:56.241 --> 12:57.862
- You forgot to buy
the Christmas ham.

12:57.965 --> 12:59.724
- Oh, don't go
blaming this on me.

12:59.827 --> 13:02.689
- You know what I want
for Christmas? A divorce!

13:02.793 --> 13:05.586
- Well, ho, ho, ho,
and call me Santa Claus,

13:05.689 --> 13:07.275
because I'm giving you
your wish.

13:15.241 --> 13:17.655
both: Happy Remember Day!

13:17.758 --> 13:19.000
- Well, it's taken 16 years,

13:19.103 --> 13:21.275
but I think our little holiday
is finally taking off.

13:21.379 --> 13:23.551
Interest on store-bought credit
cards is through the roof.

13:23.655 --> 13:26.344
- Next year, I think we can
go ahead with the parade.

13:26.448 --> 13:28.241
- That's great news.
- Quick side note-slash-

13:28.344 --> 13:29.620
awkwardly straightforward
question,

13:29.724 --> 13:30.827
John and I were wondering

13:30.931 --> 13:33.862
when we can expect
our Remember Day bonuses.

13:33.965 --> 13:36.034
- Is money
all you can think about?

13:37.275 --> 13:40.310
It's fucking Remember Day.

13:46.758 --> 13:49.413
- I got the goose.

13:54.137 --> 13:57.206
- I brought the goose, okay?

13:57.310 --> 13:59.172
I didn't forget.
There it is.

13:59.275 --> 14:01.758
So now we can all have fun
and enjoy ourselves.

14:01.862 --> 14:03.137
Remember Day isn't ruined.

14:03.241 --> 14:06.379
- That's a swan.
- Did you kill that swan?

14:06.482 --> 14:08.000
- Oh, don't go
blaming this on me!

14:08.103 --> 14:11.758
I did unforgivable things
to bring you people this goose,

14:11.862 --> 14:14.551
so somebody's gonna cook it,
and we're gonna eat it,

14:14.655 --> 14:17.206
because Hampton DeVille
is a family, God damn it.

14:18.793 --> 14:22.517
My parents got divorced
on Christmas last year.

14:22.620 --> 14:25.758
- Nobody touch the dead swan.
It looks diseased.

14:28.724 --> 14:31.034
- I think what I learned is that
I have some repressed trauma,

14:31.137 --> 14:34.241
and I really tapped
into that today.

14:34.344 --> 14:36.310
- Matt,
I want you to know that

14:36.413 --> 14:39.758
there is nothing you can do
to make this right,

14:39.862 --> 14:42.655
and you will go to your grave
a swan murderer.

14:42.758 --> 14:43.862
- That's fair.

14:43.965 --> 14:45.965
- But there's someone
who needs you right now.

14:46.068 --> 14:47.275
Jake didn't get the promotion,

14:47.379 --> 14:48.620
and he's thinking about
leaving the company.

14:48.724 --> 14:52.103
- Oh, no, he tried to
talk to me earlier, but I was--

14:52.206 --> 14:54.310
- Premeditating a swan murder.

14:54.413 --> 14:56.137
But let's not retread the past.

14:56.241 --> 14:59.172
Jake needs you,
and I can't help him,

14:59.275 --> 15:02.482
because I just don't
feel like it.

15:12.551 --> 15:14.655
- You're in my chair.

15:14.758 --> 15:16.965
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I-I will leave.

15:19.448 --> 15:21.310
- Sit back down.

15:31.275 --> 15:32.896
What's your name again?
- Jake.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.517
- Cake.
- Um--

15:36.620 --> 15:38.206
- You wanna sit at
the big table, don't you, Cake?

15:38.310 --> 15:40.034
- More than I've ever
wanted anything.

15:40.137 --> 15:42.206
- Let me ask you a question.

15:42.310 --> 15:46.275
Do you think
Santa Claus is happy?

15:46.379 --> 15:48.344
- I'm pretty Jewish, so...

15:48.448 --> 15:50.344
- I don't think Santa's happy.

15:50.448 --> 15:54.241
I mean,
maybe he started out happy,

15:54.344 --> 15:57.275
but he wanted to bring
joy to the world,

15:57.379 --> 15:59.793
so he created Christmas.

15:59.896 --> 16:01.758
But after he went down
enough chimneys,

16:01.862 --> 16:04.482
he found out
not everyone likes Christmas,

16:04.586 --> 16:08.379
that some people are
Jewish or Democrats,

16:08.482 --> 16:12.827
or they think Christmas
shouldn't be about gifts.

16:12.931 --> 16:17.310
So now Santa lives all alone
at the North Pole,

16:17.413 --> 16:22.689
surrounded by elves and reindeer
he underpays and doesn't trust,

16:22.793 --> 16:28.896
and he can't tell anymore
if Christmas is good or bad.

16:29.931 --> 16:31.862
Trust me,

16:31.965 --> 16:35.551
Santa Claus isn't happy.

16:35.655 --> 16:39.793
You're better off being
a dirty fucking elf.

16:41.241 --> 16:44.000
Is that cat hair on your suit?

16:45.275 --> 16:47.793
- Yes.
- I love cats.

16:47.896 --> 16:49.241
- Me, too.

16:49.344 --> 16:52.965
- Now I'd like you to leave.
- Got it.

16:59.517 --> 17:01.310
- Jesus! Fuck! Sorry.

17:01.413 --> 17:04.551
Uh, I've had a bit
of an emotional day.

17:04.655 --> 17:08.344
- Oh, well, I understand.

17:08.448 --> 17:09.586
Say, what have you got there?

17:09.689 --> 17:13.586
- Oh, well, there's one person
in this office

17:13.689 --> 17:14.931
who had a worst day than me,

17:15.034 --> 17:17.482
and I thought this would
cheer him up.

17:17.586 --> 17:19.206
- You--you mean me?

17:32.137 --> 17:33.137
A guitar.

17:33.241 --> 17:36.689
But I don't play.
- Oh.

17:36.793 --> 17:40.517
- Why would you do
such a nice thing for me?

17:40.620 --> 17:44.206
- Because it's Remember Day?

17:44.310 --> 17:48.379
- Thank you, Pat.
- Yeah, okay.

17:52.482 --> 17:53.793
- No, you--you are such a good

17:53.896 --> 17:56.379
- Shawn, the way you fired
that guy that one time was so--

17:56.482 --> 17:57.482
- Hey, hey.

17:57.586 --> 18:00.241
- Christian...

18:00.344 --> 18:02.103
We have something to say to you.
- Yeah.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.103
And what she says may or may not
reflect my own viewpoint.

18:05.206 --> 18:08.206
- Wait, before you do,
I have something to say.

18:08.310 --> 18:09.689
Up until a few moments ago,

18:09.793 --> 18:12.034
I had forgotten the true meaning
of Remember Day.

18:12.137 --> 18:13.103
- Huh?
- Hm?

18:13.206 --> 18:14.827
- Appreciating
the people in your life

18:14.931 --> 18:16.862
by giving them
what they care about most.

18:22.724 --> 18:26.379
- I will never forget that
Remember Day was your idea.

18:26.482 --> 18:27.310
- Yeah?
- Yes.

18:27.413 --> 18:29.206
- Yeah?
- Aw!

18:31.758 --> 18:34.965
- This feels good, doesn't it?
both: Yeah.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.827
- Hey, Jake.

18:39.931 --> 18:41.034
- Hey, Matt.

18:41.137 --> 18:42.310
- Grace told me
you didn't get the promotion.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.103
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you earlier,

18:45.206 --> 18:47.275
but you're my best friend,

18:47.379 --> 18:49.758
or best work friend,

18:49.862 --> 18:53.103
and I'm here for you now.
- Honestly, man,

18:53.206 --> 18:55.137
I know I'm kind of a nightmare
to be around in general,

18:55.241 --> 18:57.655
so don't worry about it.

18:57.758 --> 18:59.620
- So you're gonna quit?

18:59.724 --> 19:02.448
I was thinking about it,
but I kinda realized that

19:02.551 --> 19:03.896
I'd rather be
miserable at my job

19:04.000 --> 19:05.965
and be able to afford
a one-bedroom apartment

19:06.068 --> 19:08.758
than follow my dreams
and live in a studio apartment.

19:08.862 --> 19:10.517
- Capitalism is a prison.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.724
- So should we hug now?

19:12.827 --> 19:13.655
- I would like to hug.

19:18.793 --> 19:21.379
Why do you feel wet
and smell like death?

19:21.482 --> 19:22.241
- I don't wanna talk about it.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.379
- I am so glad that
I will spend this night

19:26.482 --> 19:28.000
with the people
I care about the most.

19:29.758 --> 19:31.758
- Oh, I have to go meet them
in a minute,

19:31.862 --> 19:36.034
but first,
I wanna play something.

19:41.965 --> 19:47.689
♪ Try to remember
the kind of September ♪

19:47.793 --> 19:54.000
♪ When life was slow
and oh, so mellow ♪

19:54.103 --> 20:00.034
♪ Try to remember
the kind of September ♪

20:00.137 --> 20:04.724
♪ When grass was green
and grain was yellow ♪

20:04.827 --> 20:08.241
- I'm never gonna forget this.

20:08.344 --> 20:09.931
- Well, Harold,

20:10.034 --> 20:13.965
today I beat up a drug addict
who tried to steal our dinner.

20:18.275 --> 20:23.655
- ♪ Try to remember
and if you remember ♪

20:23.758 --> 20:25.862
♪ Then follow

20:25.965 --> 20:29.103
both: ♪ Follow, follow, follow,
follow, follow, follow ♪

20:29.206 --> 20:30.551
both: ♪ Follow, follow

20:33.000 --> 20:37.103
And that's
what Remember Day's all about.

20:41.793 --> 20:42.551
- Broke into Kate
and John's offices,

20:42.655 --> 20:44.068
stole my gift cards back.

20:44.172 --> 20:47.551
- Oh, well, I mean, this is
an utterly meaningless gesture,

20:47.655 --> 20:49.482
but I appreciate
that it comes from you.

20:49.586 --> 20:50.655
- Hypothetical question,

20:50.758 --> 20:52.068
you get invited
to Osama Bin Laden's

20:52.172 --> 20:53.862
birthday party,
what do you get the guy?

20:53.965 --> 20:55.206
- Gift card.
- Absolutely.

20:55.310 --> 20:58.655
- Okay, hypothetical question,
Osama Bin Laden is alive,

20:58.758 --> 21:00.206
and he wants to
have sex with you.

21:00.310 --> 21:01.517
What do you do?

21:01.620 --> 21:02.724
- I don't know,
he's gotta woo me first.

21:02.827 --> 21:03.689
I'm not just gonna
open up for him

21:03.793 --> 21:04.896
just 'cause it's Osama, but--

21:05.000 --> 21:06.551
- You wanna be
taken out to dinner.

21:06.655 --> 21:08.931
- Yeah, I wanna be
taken out to dinner...

21:13.586 --> 21:15.344
- Mommy,
why is that man doing that?

21:15.448 --> 21:18.758
- Because 16 years ago,
terrorists attacked our nation.

21:22.517 --> 21:25.000
- Mm, mm, mm.
