00:43.502 --> 00:45.546
O'Neill.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.760
Footprints. They are recent.

00:51.844 --> 00:55.681
- How many?
- Several. Some are that of Jaffa.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.267
(rustling)

00:58.350 --> 00:59.685
Agh!

00:59.768 --> 01:01.395
Take cover!

01:10.821 --> 01:13.657
Drop your weapons and surrender!

01:15.200 --> 01:17.244
They don't look like Jaffa.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.040
He does.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.337
There is no escape.
Stand and identify yourselves.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.507
They need not.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.886
I know who they are.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.016
I'm sorry. Have we... Have we met?

01:39.516 --> 01:43.979
They are warriors from a planet
called Earth. They are known as SG-1 .

01:50.652 --> 01:52.946
How dare you return here.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.698
Look, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

03:18.657 --> 03:22.703
They are the ones who led us in the
rebellion against the servants of Heru-ur.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.913
You told us to bury our Stargate.

03:25.539 --> 03:29.585
You said that the gods would not return,
but that was not true.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.546
Cronus came in his great ship.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.340
He claimed our planet,
commanded that we serve him.

03:35.549 --> 03:40.512
- I'm sorry, but you don't understand.
- Why do you insult me, Major Carter?

03:40.637 --> 03:43.182
Would you have me believe
you have not been here?

03:43.348 --> 03:45.392
I know who you are.

03:46.185 --> 03:51.607
And you are Daniel Jackson, Teal'c,
and that is Colonel O'Neill.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.528
Where is he?

03:57.946 --> 04:00.240
Find him.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.576
Bring them.

04:32.147 --> 04:35.484
Hail, Sindar, high servant of Cronus.

04:36.401 --> 04:40.239
- Who is this?
- They came through the Chaapa-ai.

04:40.364 --> 04:45.327
They are the ones who came before and
fought against the servants of Heru-ur.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.290
You are the shol'va Teal'c.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.295
My master will be most pleased.

04:55.504 --> 04:59.758
There is another who was with them.
He escaped into the forest.

05:00.092 --> 05:03.262
- He is their leader.
- Find him.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.931
We will not fail you.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.258
- Good night, Hira.
- Good night, husband.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.596
Cronus comes tomorrow.

05:47.931 --> 05:52.477
I pray that he will reward us kindly for
having captured the warriors from Earth.

05:54.271 --> 05:59.568
I fear Cronus is disappointed our search
parties have not captured their leader.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.073
Is something wrong?
You behave strangely.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.349
That Darian guy called me "Major".

06:30.599 --> 06:34.269
- Well, this was a majorscrew-up.
- How could we know?

06:34.394 --> 06:38.148
There is always the risk that planets
may be occupied by Goa'uld forces.

06:38.273 --> 06:41.360
Yes, but one we've
actually been to before?

06:42.486 --> 06:45.489
Is it a bad sign that O'Neill
hasn't communicated yet?

06:45.697 --> 06:49.993
No. I do not believe we should
attempt to communicate with him either.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.995
The Goa'uld may track our signal.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.290
Mission time's nearly eight hours.
What do we do?

06:55.707 --> 06:58.418
Well, we can't tell them the truth.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.009
I do not understand.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.596
I know how you feel.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.932
There are two of you?

07:12.057 --> 07:13.767
Uh...

07:13.851 --> 07:15.894
It's more complicated than that.

07:16.019 --> 07:19.106
Please, do not harm my wife.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.110
I'm not gonna hurt either one of you.

07:23.235 --> 07:28.031
I just want someone to explain to me
what's happened here before I arrived.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.077
You mean...

07:32.202 --> 07:34.246
..the first time you were here?

07:36.874 --> 07:38.917
Mm-hm.

07:39.042 --> 07:43.839
You came through the Chaapa-ai. You
said our god, Heru-ur, was a false god.

07:44.089 --> 07:48.468
You organised a rebellion. With
your help, we banished Heru-ur's Jaffa.

07:48.594 --> 07:53.307
You said we were free and that
the false gods would not bother us again.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.559
We did live in peace for a time,...

07:55.684 --> 08:00.230
..but then Cronus came in his ship and
said our planet now fell under his domain.

08:00.647 --> 08:06.486
- He commanded that we worship him.
- Look. Neither one of those guys is a god.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.989
I will not believe you this time!

08:10.032 --> 08:14.912
The punishment my people suffered
for our prior indiscretion was my fault.

08:15.037 --> 08:19.124
I asked them to follow you,
and they were forced to pay dearly for it.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.668
It was not an indiscretion.

08:22.419 --> 08:26.089
It was the right thing to do,
no matter how it turned out.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.217
Do what you will.

08:29.092 --> 08:35.515
Tomorrow Cronus comes, and you and
your kind will face the consequences.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.476
Yeah, whatever.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.977
There will be no escape.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.773
Close your eyes.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.361
Close your eyes, please?

08:58.580 --> 09:01.124
How long are we to remain like this?

09:26.650 --> 09:29.570
My lord, your presence honours me.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.698
(distorted) Tell me of
the intruders from Earth.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.493
There were three. And the Jaffa Teal'c,...

09:36.910 --> 09:39.288
..the shol'va.

09:39.538 --> 09:43.542
The one called O'Neill
has thus far eluded capture.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.635
Warriors of Juna!

09:54.094 --> 09:55.971
We are called before Cronus!

10:19.494 --> 10:24.041
Warriors of Juna, for your loyalty
you shall be rewarded.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.419
Bring in the prisoners.

10:44.937 --> 10:50.150
The treaty between the System Lords
and the Asgard does not protect you here.

10:51.026 --> 10:54.947
I once told you that if
you were ever at my mercy...

10:55.989 --> 10:58.033
..l would not be kind.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.373
You will not be fortunate enough...

11:04.456 --> 11:08.836
..to die as quickly as
your father did by my hand, shol'va.

11:11.588 --> 11:15.342
Your fate will be much worse.

11:18.303 --> 11:21.098
You will all pay for your sins.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.191
Come forward.

11:34.736 --> 11:38.323
- You lead your people in my name?
- I do, my lord.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.957
Take it.

12:12.608 --> 12:15.068
In honour of your god,...

12:16.195 --> 12:18.238
..kill him.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.994
Hashac cree!

12:31.793 --> 12:33.837
Kill him!

13:44.408 --> 13:46.451
(alarm)

13:51.039 --> 13:53.083
Receiving IDC.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.130
Sir, we're receiving a signal
on the IDC frequency,...

13:58.213 --> 14:00.674
..but this is not an authorised SGC code.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.513
It says "Comtrya".

14:07.139 --> 14:12.686
- What does it mean?
- Ah, it's kinda like "shalom" or "aloha".

14:12.769 --> 14:14.229
That stuff.

14:14.313 --> 14:17.816
It was the greeting used by the
artificial life form Harlan on PX3-989.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.402
- The one who duplicated you?
- Yes.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.864
Sir, please don't open the gate. Please?

14:24.281 --> 14:27.868
I admit he was annoying,
but he wasn't a serious threat.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.082
Open the iris.

14:47.513 --> 14:50.516
Oooh! I have no weapons.

14:50.641 --> 14:52.684
Stand down.

14:54.436 --> 14:58.273
Oh, thank you for opening
the doorway device which you call iris.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.026
Just for the record, I was opposed.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.656
Welcome. I'm General Hammond,
leader of this facility.

15:06.031 --> 15:10.494
Comtrya! Yes, I have
heard so much about you.

15:12.746 --> 15:17.543
- What's wrong, Harlan?
- Oh, please, yes, it is a big emergency.

15:17.668 --> 15:20.462
Um, you must help...

15:20.546 --> 15:22.422
..you.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.031
What are you?

15:51.118 --> 15:52.911
Speak!

16:02.921 --> 16:07.050
Speak, or I shall have you torn apart.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.847
Bring them to the ship.

16:13.682 --> 16:17.186
- Find the other one.
- Yes, my lord.

16:19.021 --> 16:22.357
I told them not to go. I begged them.

16:22.441 --> 16:26.195
Going through the Stargate,
it is dangerous, no? Very dangerous.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.699
You told me all about the Goa'uld,
you did. And you must help. Yes? No?

16:30.782 --> 16:32.743
- Harlan!
- Yes?

16:32.826 --> 16:34.870
- Sit.
- Yes.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.793
Now, from the beginning.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.505
The beginning? Yes.

16:44.630 --> 16:48.634
They were not happy.
They could not stop being you.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.720
- The portable power pak you invented...
- The robot me?

16:51.845 --> 16:55.265
Oh, it was ingenious. Even Hubald
would have been impressed.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.893
I have one in my chest now.
Would you like to see it?

16:58.018 --> 16:59.603
- Yes.
- No!

17:01.104 --> 17:04.942
- You can show her later.
- Later, yes. Help first.

17:05.358 --> 17:09.195
- What type of help do you require?
- Oh, not me. You.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.989
Um, I mean the others.

17:12.574 --> 17:15.536
- What exactly has happened?
- They have not returned.

17:16.411 --> 17:19.248
- Where are they?
- Away. They go away.

17:19.373 --> 17:22.542
Are you saying they go
through the Stargate on missions?

17:22.835 --> 17:24.711
Missions, yes.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.755
What for?

17:26.839 --> 17:30.676
I do not really know.
What is it that you do?

17:33.554 --> 17:38.350
It was my understanding that
the robots agreed to bury their Stargate...

17:38.433 --> 17:40.811
..and never leave their planet.

17:41.770 --> 17:42.771
Yes, sir.

17:42.896 --> 17:48.318
It would seem your robot counterpart is
equally as good at obeying orders as you.

17:48.402 --> 17:51.572
They have always returned
after 24 hours, for safety.

17:51.655 --> 17:55.075
The power paks only last 48 hours,
then they must be recharged.

17:55.534 --> 17:57.911
- How overdue are they?
- 16 hours.

17:57.995 --> 18:01.498
They do not have much time left. (moans)

18:07.504 --> 18:09.298
What is it?

18:09.381 --> 18:11.425
What has happened?

18:12.009 --> 18:14.553
It was unlike anything I have ever seen.

18:24.730 --> 18:30.068
Cronus brought the prisoners before us.
I was given a weapon of the guards.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.446
To demonstrate my loyalty,...

18:32.571 --> 18:36.867
..Cronus instructed me to kill
the one called Daniel Jackson.

18:36.950 --> 18:40.204
- And so?
- I fired the weapon.

18:42.331 --> 18:45.334
What happened next was unholy.

18:46.376 --> 18:51.089
I have seen men decapitated in battle.
What I saw was not human.

18:51.173 --> 18:54.676
- That was not the most disturbing thing.
- What was?

18:54.968 --> 19:00.891
Cronus was as shocked by the fact Daniel
Jackson was not human as the rest of us.

19:01.892 --> 19:04.561
He sent us away immediately.

19:04.645 --> 19:07.981
But how could a true god
be surprised by anything?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.734
That is what I ask myself.

19:14.112 --> 19:18.826
General, I really don't think we are
responsible for retrieving these robots.

19:19.034 --> 19:23.121
- But you must. They are you.
- Not me, they're not.

19:23.914 --> 19:27.584
- Where's Dr Jackson? He will help.
- He's on a mission at the moment.

19:27.751 --> 19:30.045
Oh, you do that so much.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.298
The fact is, I don't want
to risk any of my people...

19:33.382 --> 19:37.219
..for the sake of some androids
you created without authorisation.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.889
- However,...
- However, yes?

19:40.973 --> 19:44.476
..l am concerned that
information about this facility...

19:44.560 --> 19:46.937
..could fall into the wrong hands.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.814
Ah. An excellent point.

19:48.939 --> 19:52.609
Sirs, if I may. Our robots
are really so much like us...

19:52.693 --> 19:56.530
..they probably couldn't resist
the chance to use the gate to explore.

19:56.613 --> 20:00.117
I think we can also assume
they'd guard top-secret information...

20:00.242 --> 20:02.286
..as closely as we would.

20:03.662 --> 20:08.292
Besides, they don't have our IDC codes,
so they can't give those away.

20:08.375 --> 20:12.462
Colonel O'Neill, if you don't want
to take this on, I won't make it an order.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.423
Thank you, sir.

20:14.506 --> 20:19.636
But I have grown accustomed.
I cannot go on without them.

20:20.554 --> 20:22.014
Sorry.

20:24.349 --> 20:27.436
Then I will just have
to help myself. (chuckles)

20:35.068 --> 20:37.696
This one, this one, that one,...

20:37.779 --> 20:40.866
..this one, that one and this one.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.535
Hm.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.497
"Hm" what?

20:50.292 --> 20:52.336
That's what I thought.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.130
P3X-729. We've been to this planet before.

20:55.506 --> 20:59.426
We engaged in battle with Heru-ur
and liberated the people of Juna.

20:59.510 --> 21:03.430
That's right. We told them
to bury the gate after we were gone.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.933
Are you sure it's right?

21:06.058 --> 21:11.730
I could do a full diagnostic of my system,
but it'd be quicker to just dial the address.

21:11.855 --> 21:14.149
- Proceed.
- Yes, sir.

21:40.008 --> 21:42.386
(technician) Chevron six encoded.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.475
Chevron seven locked.

21:53.647 --> 21:55.107
The gate isn't buried.

21:55.357 --> 21:59.111
It is possible the Goa'uld went there
by ship to reinstate command.

21:59.236 --> 22:04.283
But Heru-ur is dead, the naqahdah mine
was dry... Those people posed no threat.

22:04.366 --> 22:08.537
Another Goa'uld may have claimed
the planet for different reasons.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.497
Why?

22:10.581 --> 22:14.626
- Possibly strategic military position.
- We told them they'd be OK.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.421
Send a probe. Let's find out.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.840
Yes, sir.

22:25.637 --> 22:28.098
(weapon firing, screams)

22:33.520 --> 22:35.397
Receiving MALP telemetry.

22:53.207 --> 22:54.291
Wow.

22:55.918 --> 22:59.338
- Never get used to that.
- This is General Hammond of the SGC.

22:59.630 --> 23:02.549
Hey, George. How ya doin'?
Who else you got with you?

23:02.716 --> 23:06.845
Major Carter, Teal'c,
Colonel O'Neill and Harlan.

23:08.347 --> 23:11.934
Harlan! I told you to stay away from Earth!

23:12.017 --> 23:14.144
Well, I told you to bury your gate!

23:14.478 --> 23:17.731
You seem to think that
solves a lot ofproblems, don't you?

23:17.856 --> 23:22.236
- (Hammond) SG-1 followed my orders.
- I'm sorry. I did not know what else to do.

23:22.319 --> 23:24.363
Please return to our planet.

23:24.488 --> 23:26.365
I can't do thatjust yet.

23:29.201 --> 23:32.204
Do not shoot. I wish to help you.

23:32.788 --> 23:33.789
Why?

23:33.914 --> 23:38.794
I now believe you spoke the truth
about everything, including the gods.

23:39.753 --> 23:44.967
- Why should I believe you?
- You must trust me, as I must trust you.

23:48.011 --> 23:50.722
I am sorry about the one called Daniel.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.271
Get overhere.

24:01.942 --> 24:03.986
- To whom do you speak?
- It's Darian.

24:04.111 --> 24:08.198
Earth. George Hammond
and the other SG-1.

24:08.657 --> 24:11.827
Hey! You're the other, pal.

24:12.369 --> 24:15.372
Do we really have time
forsemantics here?

24:18.542 --> 24:21.086
What exactly is the current situation?

24:22.045 --> 24:24.965
- Our Daniel is dead.
- Oh, my.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.885
Carterand Teal'c have
been captured by Cronus.

24:28.177 --> 24:31.597
He's got a ship in orbit
and his Jaffa are everywhere.

24:32.472 --> 24:35.017
So it's just Darian and me.

24:36.768 --> 24:39.062
Please, help us.

24:43.692 --> 24:46.069
You have a go. SG-1 is on its way.

24:46.195 --> 24:48.238
Thank you, George. Harlan!

24:48.906 --> 24:50.949
You stay there!

25:05.088 --> 25:08.091
They appear to be
a fascinating technology.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.636
(Cronus) Find out how they work.

25:17.142 --> 25:20.229
I wish to know all
the information they contain.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.606
My pleasure.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.751
This way.

25:50.259 --> 25:52.803
- They look very much like you.
- (Carter) We know.

25:52.928 --> 25:56.849
Listen, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry about what's happened here.

25:57.599 --> 26:00.310
Oh, I'm sure that makes him feel better.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.481
Hey!

26:07.359 --> 26:11.405
- What the hell do you think you're doin'?
- Same thing you do. Only better.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.408
- What does that mean?
- Better?

26:14.533 --> 26:16.827
It means better,...

26:16.910 --> 26:19.037
..stronger, faster.

26:19.955 --> 26:22.332
You're not me and
don't work for the Air Force.

26:22.708 --> 26:26.044
No. But that doesn't mean
I can't do the job.

26:27.754 --> 26:31.758
- What job?
- Explore the universe, fight the Goa'uld.

26:31.967 --> 26:35.053
- What? Like now?
- Hey, you made this mess.

26:35.137 --> 26:40.100
- What we did was help these people.
- Come on! I know you better than that.

26:41.143 --> 26:44.146
You screwed up and
now you're embarrassed.

26:46.231 --> 26:49.568
- That's not the point.
- And like I'm gonna spend my eternity...

26:49.693 --> 26:51.570
..on that lame-ass planet!

26:51.695 --> 26:56.074
- You gave me your word!
- Is it the first time you've lied to yourself?

26:56.825 --> 27:01.538
I told you what you wanted to hear.
Besides, were you gonna destroy me?!

27:01.663 --> 27:06.376
- I might have.
- All right, come on. Bring it on, flyboy!

27:06.460 --> 27:08.587
Oh, you little...

27:08.670 --> 27:10.631
Sirs!

27:10.756 --> 27:15.052
Much as I'd like to see how this plays out,
don't we have something important to do?

27:21.725 --> 27:26.855
- What can so few of us possibly do?
- Hammond won't spring for more troops?

27:26.939 --> 27:30.275
I didn't ask! This is our problem.

27:31.527 --> 27:35.197
- We can't expect help from your people?
- No.

27:35.322 --> 27:38.992
We convinced your people
to oppose the Goa'uld once before.

27:39.117 --> 27:42.871
Most, including myself,
had never seen an actual god before.

27:43.288 --> 27:45.833
Heru-ur had not come
to Juna for generations.

27:46.124 --> 27:50.838
And when Cronus arrived and displayed
his great power, he instilled much fear.

27:53.757 --> 27:55.384
The people are terrified.

27:55.634 --> 27:59.388
Then we must demonstrate
once and for all that Cronus is not a god.

27:59.471 --> 28:04.184
I assume you have a plan to back up
that rather bold yet cryptic statement?

28:04.309 --> 28:06.520
Yes! Yes, we do.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.190
(horn call)

28:10.315 --> 28:13.485
It is not safe here.
The forests are heavily patrolled.

28:15.737 --> 28:19.408
- We're not done, pal.
- I so own you.

28:32.045 --> 28:36.842
There is a device in the chest that
sensors indicate may be a power unit.

28:36.967 --> 28:39.970
Current status: deactivated.

28:42.931 --> 28:45.309
Can it be reactivated?

28:58.155 --> 29:00.199
Do you feel pain?

29:07.372 --> 29:09.416
Affirmative.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.887
Do you sympathise with him?

29:26.266 --> 29:28.143
No!

29:30.145 --> 29:33.232
Both units appear to show
concern for each other.

29:42.533 --> 29:45.536
Tell me how to reactivate
this one's power unit.

29:49.414 --> 29:54.920
Then tell me which one of you would like
to feel sympathy, and which one the pain.

29:55.546 --> 29:58.257
The only rings I've seen
were in that pyramid.

29:58.632 --> 30:03.428
- There is a way into the main chamber.
- Yeah. By putting the robot at risk.

30:04.304 --> 30:06.932
Fine. I'll do it.

30:07.808 --> 30:12.771
- It's all right. I can handle it.
- This is very strange to me.

30:12.896 --> 30:15.774
This kind of thing
happens to us all the time.

30:15.858 --> 30:18.652
How many Jaffa do we
have to deal with on that ship?

30:19.027 --> 30:22.281
As many as one thousand.
But that is not the problem.

30:23.073 --> 30:26.243
- What is?
- The rings are activated from the ship.

30:26.910 --> 30:31.039
- You didn't mention that before.
- We had little time to formulate this plan.

30:31.123 --> 30:34.626
It's all right. Carter and Teal'c
might be able to help.

30:41.466 --> 30:45.387
- The other ones.
- How'll they know what to do and when?

30:46.305 --> 30:48.599
I can communicate with them.

30:49.850 --> 30:53.437
I've been maintaining radio silence
to protect my location.

30:53.687 --> 30:57.608
- I don't see a radio.
- They're internal.

30:57.733 --> 31:01.403
- So you can actually send a signal...
- Wait... Excuse me.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.578
A little static.

31:11.705 --> 31:16.335
- They said they'd do what they can.
- What about the Jaffa on the ship?

31:16.418 --> 31:19.922
Once we reach the peltak level,
the other levels can be sealed off.

31:20.047 --> 31:22.341
Cronus will have few Jaffa remaining.

31:22.508 --> 31:25.928
What do we do with the other Jaffa
once we've dealt with Cronus?

31:26.386 --> 31:28.680
We offer them freedom.

31:43.695 --> 31:48.826
My lord, the machine that resembles
Teal'c requests an audience with you.

31:51.245 --> 31:54.248
- For what purpose?
- He wishes to bargain with you...

31:54.373 --> 31:57.376
..for the freedom of the one called Carter.

31:57.459 --> 32:01.922
- What have you learnt so far?
- They have been unwilling to cooperate.

32:02.005 --> 32:06.635
However, their behaviour
is curiously similar to that of humans.

32:06.760 --> 32:11.723
Perhaps you will be more successful
in extracting the necessary information.

32:12.266 --> 32:15.102
Bring the one that
resembles Teal'c before me.

32:32.578 --> 32:34.204
Report.

32:34.538 --> 32:37.249
The intruder has been captured.

32:57.477 --> 32:59.354
Agh!

33:01.773 --> 33:06.653
Tell me how to operate the power core
on that unit and I will stop damaging you.

33:08.405 --> 33:10.449
It's simple.

33:11.200 --> 33:15.120
Just touch the two crystals
on opposite sides of the converter.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.550
Interesting.

33:33.722 --> 33:36.266
Cronus will be very pleased.

33:37.184 --> 33:41.813
Truth be told, I do not think
Cronus will be pleased at all.

34:21.562 --> 34:24.313
- You all right?
- I am.

34:25.899 --> 34:29.570
I'm fine, too. Thanks for your concern.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.031
Are you all right?

34:35.826 --> 34:37.870
A little gas.

34:39.788 --> 34:41.665
Yeah, got gas.

34:46.670 --> 34:51.049
What is it you wish to tell me
in exchange for the other one's freedom?

34:54.386 --> 34:56.429
My only wish...

35:00.017 --> 35:02.978
..is to seek revenge
for the death of my father.

35:30.881 --> 35:34.218
- Is it now active?
- In a way.

35:39.348 --> 35:43.727
- What does this mean?
- I designed it with special sensors...

35:43.810 --> 35:47.481
..that would detect when someone
was tampering with the power core.

35:47.564 --> 35:49.441
For situations just like this.

35:50.692 --> 35:53.153
It's a self-destruct mode.

36:02.663 --> 36:04.706
(alarm)

36:06.458 --> 36:08.335
Go!

36:38.365 --> 36:40.242
- Nice work.
- Teal'c's in trouble.

36:40.784 --> 36:43.704
- Where?
- He's on the peltak with Cronus.

36:46.456 --> 36:51.170
- We need to seal off this level.
- There's a control centre for all the doors.

36:51.253 --> 36:54.047
Kinda like a circuit panel.

37:02.181 --> 37:04.224
Jaffa, cree!

37:12.816 --> 37:14.860
(buzzing)

37:34.463 --> 37:36.590
I've got your six.

38:18.382 --> 38:20.759
The crystals are protected
by a force shield!

38:20.884 --> 38:22.761
Switch with me. I'll do it.

38:22.886 --> 38:24.346
(firing)

38:29.768 --> 38:32.646
- What do I do?
- Pull the green crystals out.

38:32.855 --> 38:35.858
The doors should close
and lock automatically.

39:28.368 --> 39:30.412
For our father.

40:05.614 --> 40:07.658
That's it!

40:38.856 --> 40:42.693
- You are very badly damaged.
- Yes.

40:43.861 --> 40:46.697
But you are a machine.
Can you not be mended?

40:47.698 --> 40:49.741
Possibly.

40:53.328 --> 40:55.455
Darian.

40:56.206 --> 40:58.333
I'm running out of energy.

41:01.170 --> 41:03.547
I will shut down soon.

41:05.507 --> 41:09.344
I promise... you will never be forgotten.

41:32.409 --> 41:34.536
Go tell your people Cronus is dead.

41:36.622 --> 41:40.375
If they still think he's a god,
have 'em come take a look.

41:49.843 --> 41:51.887
Carter and Teal'c?

42:01.104 --> 42:03.398
Yours don't look so good.

42:05.818 --> 42:09.238
The real ones... are OK.

42:10.322 --> 42:13.242
Are we still so far from real to you?

42:16.912 --> 42:18.539
No,...

42:18.664 --> 42:20.707
..l guess not.

42:21.416 --> 42:23.460
Then I believe...

42:25.838 --> 42:27.881
..we are done.
