WEBVTT

00:02.047 --> 00:05.364
If I've learned anything from this,

00:05.366 --> 00:07.083
it's that I do better living alone.

00:07.085 --> 00:08.868
Pretty soon you'll have
someone sharing your space,

00:08.870 --> 00:11.971
and they'll be sharing it
for, like, the next 18 years.

00:11.973 --> 00:14.257
I share more than a surname with Boris.

00:14.259 --> 00:16.009
You have the same genetic disease.

00:16.011 --> 00:17.593
Once we finalize the protocols,

00:17.595 --> 00:20.680
this will walk, talk, and smell
like a real clinical trial.

00:20.682 --> 00:22.715
I want to know what it is he had Dmitry

00:22.717 --> 00:24.484
trying to find at Shadow Pond.

00:24.486 --> 00:26.102
It's called detailing the provenance.

00:26.104 --> 00:28.571
You have to do it for every auction.

00:28.573 --> 00:29.889
If it works, we get Milos

00:29.891 --> 00:30.990
and whatever he's been after.

00:30.992 --> 00:33.326
And if it doesn't,

00:33.328 --> 00:34.661
we still get Milos.

00:34.663 --> 00:36.228
That was Boris.

00:36.230 --> 00:37.664
Everything all right?

00:37.666 --> 00:40.366
The men he had trailing Milos
lost track of him.

00:40.368 --> 00:41.751
We know what happened to the last guy

00:41.753 --> 00:43.402
Milos got suspicious of,
he had him killed.

00:43.404 --> 00:45.788
Actually, he did it himself.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:16.570 --> 01:20.456
Oh!

01:20.458 --> 01:23.042
- What are you doing up?
- What are you doing up?

01:23.044 --> 01:24.544
I can't sleep. I saw the light on.

01:24.546 --> 01:26.162
I thought maybe you had
some news about Milos.

01:26.164 --> 01:28.447
No news. He's still missing, okay?

01:28.449 --> 01:30.416
He's been gone a whole week,
you know that?

01:30.418 --> 01:32.051
What if they just never find him?

01:32.053 --> 01:33.386
What do we do then?

01:33.388 --> 01:35.287
I don't know. Go back to bed, Ev.

01:35.289 --> 01:36.255
Maybe he's been arrested already,

01:36.257 --> 01:37.557
Boris just forgot to call.

01:37.559 --> 01:39.392
Maybe Boris had him killed.

01:39.394 --> 01:42.395
I won't say the thought
hasn't crossed my mind.

01:46.133 --> 01:47.900
Boris.

01:47.902 --> 01:49.902
Oh, my God.

01:54.491 --> 01:55.575
Welcome back.

01:55.577 --> 01:56.976
Thank you.

01:56.978 --> 02:00.279
So you guys are just...

02:00.281 --> 02:02.081
Hey, what's going on here?

02:02.083 --> 02:03.332
I thought I was part of this.

02:03.334 --> 02:05.118
You are, you are.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.153
We were just trying to come up
with a contingency plan

02:07.155 --> 02:09.088
in case we have
to call the whole thing off.

02:09.090 --> 02:10.423
What do you mean, call it off?

02:10.425 --> 02:11.541
You can't call it off.

02:11.543 --> 02:13.760
Milos is a monster, Henry.

02:13.762 --> 02:15.511
He tried to kill Marisa
when she was pregnant.

02:15.513 --> 02:16.846
He tried to kill Boris.
He succeeded in killing...

02:16.848 --> 02:20.216
I assure you, Evan, one way or another,

02:20.218 --> 02:23.770
Milos will answer for his sins.

02:23.772 --> 02:26.889
Okay, all right,
what can we do in the meantime?

02:26.891 --> 02:28.224
We stick with the plan.

02:28.226 --> 02:30.009
We're monitoring points of entry.

02:30.011 --> 02:32.695
Obviously if we can't find him,

02:32.697 --> 02:34.480
the clinical trial
and the auction won't happen.

02:34.482 --> 02:37.016
Of course, they were never
intended to happen, so...

02:37.018 --> 02:39.402
Of course. Wait, what?

02:39.404 --> 02:40.870
I don't understand.

02:40.872 --> 02:44.490
Henry, this catalogue is real.

02:44.492 --> 02:45.792
My wife's job is real.

02:45.794 --> 02:47.359
Your priceless antiques are real.

02:47.361 --> 02:49.378
What about this auction is not real?

02:49.380 --> 02:51.798
The auction itself.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.667
It was just bait to lure Milos here.

02:54.669 --> 02:56.636
Oh, okay.

02:56.638 --> 02:58.054
How did I not know that?

02:58.056 --> 02:59.589
Don't blame your brother, Evan.

02:59.591 --> 03:01.257
I asked him not to share
everything with you.

03:01.259 --> 03:04.560
I hope you can understand.

03:04.562 --> 03:06.596
Yeah, I totally understand.

03:06.598 --> 03:08.380
Look, we thought we could
send Milos the catalogue,

03:08.382 --> 03:10.382
find out what at Shadow Pond
he was interested in,

03:10.384 --> 03:12.735
and have him arrested
before he ever got past JFK.

03:12.737 --> 03:14.887
But he disappeared

03:14.889 --> 03:16.405
before the catalogue could be delivered.

03:16.407 --> 03:19.192
Franklin. I must return to the city.

03:19.194 --> 03:22.394
Evan, I trust you'll keep
everything you've learned

03:22.396 --> 03:23.613
to yourself?

03:23.615 --> 03:26.398
Of course.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.580
Okay, the next order of business

03:41.582 --> 03:43.933
is getting someone else to say
the next order of business

03:43.935 --> 03:45.685
while I am busy at the auction.

03:45.687 --> 03:47.136
How's that going?

03:47.138 --> 03:49.472
Ah, it's exhilarating and exhausting.

03:49.474 --> 03:51.590
But in the end,
it's gonna be so worth it.

03:51.592 --> 03:52.725
Hey, Hank, you don't think

03:52.727 --> 03:54.260
she should stress herself out, do you?

03:54.262 --> 03:56.195
Stress can be really hard
on the body, right?

03:56.197 --> 03:57.313
Evan, not now.

03:57.315 --> 03:58.898
Honey, I'm fine.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.616
Oh, I almost forgot, a new patient,

04:00.618 --> 04:02.451
Bert Jones, called yesterday
thinking his appointment

04:02.453 --> 04:04.036
this morning would be here
at the guest house.

04:04.038 --> 04:05.938
Ah, did you tell him
we can't see patients here?

04:05.940 --> 04:07.406
I left a message on his voice mail.

04:07.408 --> 04:08.791
You know what,
I wouldn't worry about it.

04:08.793 --> 04:10.877
Hank prefers to handle
all the details himself.

04:10.879 --> 04:13.329
Oh, God.

04:13.331 --> 04:14.747
Hank?

04:14.749 --> 04:17.132
Evan? Is everything okay?

04:17.135 --> 04:18.166
Yep, yep, yep. Everything's great.

04:19.337 --> 04:21.087
It's great. It couldn't be better.

04:21.089 --> 04:23.289
If it were, it would be strange.

04:23.291 --> 04:24.423
It's Russel.

04:24.425 --> 04:26.392
One of his specialists cut himself.

04:26.394 --> 04:27.843
Can one of you...

04:27.845 --> 04:29.679
- I'll go.
- I'll go too.

04:33.150 --> 04:35.902
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:35.904 --> 04:37.403
All right, out with it.

04:37.405 --> 04:39.071
I am really mad about last night.

04:39.073 --> 04:40.740
I really thought
you seemed okay with it.

04:40.742 --> 04:42.191
It was late, and Boris was there,

04:42.193 --> 04:43.659
and Boris scares the hell out of me.

04:43.661 --> 04:44.944
Look, if I told you everything,

04:44.946 --> 04:46.362
you would've told Paige.

04:46.364 --> 04:47.830
And she would've felt obligated
to tell her boss.

04:47.832 --> 04:49.949
Isn't that my decision to make?

04:49.951 --> 04:51.918
Evan, Boris is trying
to stop a murderer,

04:51.920 --> 04:53.202
and we're arguing about an auction

04:53.204 --> 04:54.287
that's not gonna happen.

04:54.289 --> 04:55.421
It's not gonna happen?

04:55.423 --> 04:56.956
Have you looked outside recently?

04:56.958 --> 04:58.457
Sutton and Chesterfield
will be paid for their work.

04:58.459 --> 05:00.009
That's supposed to just make it right?

05:00.011 --> 05:01.260
Paige has worked her ass off.

05:01.262 --> 05:02.712
They're planning a huge event.

05:02.714 --> 05:03.963
When is Boris gonna tell 'em
it's not happening?

05:03.965 --> 05:05.181
I don't know.

05:05.183 --> 05:06.432
I don't know. That's his call.

05:06.434 --> 05:08.134
Evan, this is really important.

05:08.136 --> 05:10.886
Boris is trying to get his life back.

05:10.888 --> 05:12.555
Please don't lose sight of that, okay?

05:12.557 --> 05:14.473
Oh, okay.

05:22.784 --> 05:26.869
I'm gonna get that, unless
you wanna do that yourself too.

05:30.207 --> 05:31.991
Hello, I'm looking for Dr. Lawson.

05:31.993 --> 05:34.627
Oh, I guess you didn't get the message.

05:34.629 --> 05:36.462
Message?

05:36.464 --> 05:39.332
Yeah, we are unable to treat
patients here temporarily,

05:39.334 --> 05:41.083
but...

05:41.085 --> 05:42.551
You're Mr. Jones, right?

05:42.553 --> 05:43.669
No, I am...

05:43.671 --> 05:44.920
Milos!

05:44.922 --> 05:46.839
Welcome to Shadow Pond.

05:46.841 --> 05:48.874
Thank you.

05:51.511 --> 05:52.428
Come in.

05:52.430 --> 05:57.430
Royal Pains 5x08 - Hammertime
Original air date August 7, 2013

05:57.455 --> 06:02.455
Sync and corrections by atrn97g
for www.addic7ed.com

06:05.325 --> 06:06.909
There is a murderer in our powder room.

06:06.911 --> 06:08.527
Calm down. We'll figure it out.

06:08.529 --> 06:10.362
When did he get here?
How did he clear immigration?

06:10.364 --> 06:11.747
Evan, we don't have a lot of time.

06:11.749 --> 06:12.898
He probably took
a private jet, probably...

06:12.900 --> 06:14.199
He snuck into the country.

06:14.201 --> 06:17.336
Listen to me. I want you to go.

06:17.338 --> 06:18.754
- Where?
- Anywhere but here.

06:18.756 --> 06:20.172
Call Boris, tell him what's happened,

06:20.174 --> 06:22.041
and do not come back.

06:22.043 --> 06:24.910
Give me your phone.
I'll put in his number.

06:24.912 --> 06:27.412
Okay.

06:29.767 --> 06:31.300
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:31.302 --> 06:33.085
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll keep an eye on him.

06:33.087 --> 06:35.387
Maybe I can start the work up
for the clinical trial.

06:35.389 --> 06:37.639
Wait, Henry, please...

06:37.641 --> 06:39.608
Don't worry. I'll be okay.

06:42.529 --> 06:45.564
Hank.

06:45.566 --> 06:48.200
What is this?

06:49.869 --> 06:52.621
Yes, Hank is with him right now.

06:52.623 --> 06:54.272
He's gonna start doing his doctor thing

06:54.274 --> 06:56.792
for the, you know,
the fake clinical trial.

06:56.794 --> 06:59.277
Good. Seems you have
everything well in hand.

06:59.279 --> 07:00.612
I'll be there as soon as I can.

07:00.614 --> 07:01.997
Should I call the police

07:01.999 --> 07:03.799
or the FBI or the Pentagon maybe?

07:03.801 --> 07:04.950
I think not, Evan.

07:04.952 --> 07:06.085
Make no more calls.

07:06.087 --> 07:08.637
Ask Hank to keep an eye on Milos

07:08.639 --> 07:10.122
and don't alarm him.

07:10.124 --> 07:11.557
- I'll handle the rest.
- All right, but...

07:18.399 --> 07:22.985
And you barely touched the blade.

07:22.987 --> 07:24.653
Were you able to save my finger?

07:24.655 --> 07:26.522
It's my texting finger.

07:26.524 --> 07:27.739
You're going to be fine.

07:27.741 --> 07:28.941
Though I'm going to give you

07:28.943 --> 07:30.659
a tetanus shot just to be safe.

07:30.661 --> 07:33.779
When was the last time you had one?

07:33.781 --> 07:36.949
I was ten. Camp Chatuga for boys.

07:36.951 --> 07:38.834
Cut my foot on a rusty nail.

07:38.836 --> 07:40.369
Evils of summer camp.

07:40.371 --> 07:41.920
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

07:41.922 --> 07:45.090
This camp, they wouldn't spend
money to fix anything.

07:45.092 --> 07:47.926
We had to ride
emotionally damaged ponies.

07:47.928 --> 07:49.678
You can imagine

07:49.680 --> 07:52.097
how a boy would be wounded
by that, right?

07:52.099 --> 07:55.434
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

07:55.436 --> 07:56.602
I compensate now

07:56.604 --> 07:58.303
by exhibiting a sense of humor

07:58.305 --> 07:59.972
with just a touch of the bad boy in it.

07:59.974 --> 08:02.891
Wade.

08:02.893 --> 08:03.892
Are you okay?

08:03.894 --> 08:05.177
I'm fine.

08:05.179 --> 08:06.228
Luckily, I just missed the flexor...

08:06.230 --> 08:08.147
You had me at fine.

08:08.149 --> 08:11.483
Upstairs now.

08:11.485 --> 08:14.403
Not too much girl talk.
She has a job to do.

08:14.405 --> 08:17.406
- Chop-chop.
- Okay.

08:19.860 --> 08:21.410
So if Wade asks, which he will,

08:21.412 --> 08:22.578
can I give him your number?

08:22.580 --> 08:23.912
What are you talking about?

08:23.914 --> 08:25.030
He was totally flirting with you.

08:25.032 --> 08:26.582
- He was?
- Yes.

08:26.584 --> 08:27.866
Like a ten-year-old who just got back

08:27.868 --> 08:29.418
from Camp Chatuga for boys.

08:29.420 --> 08:33.054
I totally missed it.

08:39.544 --> 08:41.880
Wow, your leg has healed nicely.

08:41.881 --> 08:44.382
When did the external fixation
device come off?

08:44.384 --> 08:46.185
Two weeks ago, as scheduled.

08:46.187 --> 08:49.855
Speaking of schedules,

08:49.857 --> 08:52.241
shall we move on to what's
needed for the clinical trial?

08:52.243 --> 08:55.160
Your brother, he said
you can't see patients here.

08:55.162 --> 08:57.896
You're an exception.

09:03.503 --> 09:05.921
I'm glad you're here.

09:05.923 --> 09:08.624
I have to admit, when you didn't
answer my calls or texts,

09:08.626 --> 09:10.626
I thought maybe you
lost interest in this treatment.

09:10.628 --> 09:13.078
In my family,
we have to travel discreetly,

09:13.080 --> 09:14.463
as you must understand.

09:14.465 --> 09:16.798
Sometimes there is a lapse
in communication.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.968
- Uh-huh.
- So this auction,

09:19.970 --> 09:21.053
it is tomorrow?

09:21.055 --> 09:24.306
Yes. It is.

09:24.308 --> 09:27.476
Is the preview today?

09:27.478 --> 09:28.727
II don't know.

09:28.729 --> 09:30.395
I haven't paid much attention.

09:30.397 --> 09:32.898
I know it all came together
very quickly.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.784
Did you get off a plane
within the last few hours?

09:35.786 --> 09:38.237
And how is that relevant?

09:38.239 --> 09:40.322
I'm just trying to figure out

09:40.324 --> 09:43.208
why your blood pressure's a little high.

09:46.779 --> 09:50.465
It was a long journey.

09:50.467 --> 09:52.334
I'm gonna need some labs.

09:52.336 --> 09:54.452
When was the last time you ate?

09:54.454 --> 09:56.054
Two hours ago.

09:56.056 --> 09:58.590
Well, we need you to be
fasting for four hours

09:58.592 --> 10:00.509
before we take them.

10:00.511 --> 10:02.394
Milos, you should rest.

10:02.396 --> 10:03.762
We have a guest room.

10:03.764 --> 10:05.514
Why don't you lie down for a few hours?

10:05.516 --> 10:07.983
I would like.

10:11.237 --> 10:14.106
- Thank you.
- Yep.

10:19.145 --> 10:22.147
Well, I called to make
an appointment for my wife.

10:22.149 --> 10:23.782
I was at the doctor last week.

10:23.784 --> 10:28.120
Why didn't you want her
to see your usual doctor?

10:28.122 --> 10:29.588
Between you and me, when I was there,

10:29.590 --> 10:31.089
I noticed he was wearing a pair of pants

10:31.091 --> 10:32.674
I gave to Goodwill last year.

10:32.676 --> 10:34.710
Those weren't your pants.

10:34.712 --> 10:36.678
They were definitely my pants.

10:36.680 --> 10:40.549
Besides which, he thinks
all my problems are age-related.

10:40.551 --> 10:42.384
Where does he get an idea like that?

10:42.386 --> 10:45.771
Divya, I want you to meet
my best girl Bea.

10:45.773 --> 10:47.856
We're married happily,

10:47.858 --> 10:49.891
I might add,
just to be up-front about that.

10:49.893 --> 10:51.843
Thank you for your honesty.

10:51.845 --> 10:53.812
- It's nice to meet you.
- You as well.

10:57.484 --> 10:59.701
You know, I have to keep reminding sid

10:59.703 --> 11:02.120
it's my eyesight that's bad,
not my hearing.

11:02.122 --> 11:03.822
Actually, that won't help

11:03.824 --> 11:05.407
because he has short-term memory issues.

11:06.693 --> 11:08.360
You know, maybe I should stick around

11:08.362 --> 11:09.378
and skip the tournament.

11:09.380 --> 11:11.163
It's lawn bowling, you know.

11:11.165 --> 11:12.831
Don't be so neurotic.

11:12.833 --> 11:15.884
I'll be fine.

11:15.886 --> 11:18.837
Okay.

11:18.839 --> 11:21.423
Hmm.

11:21.425 --> 11:22.924
- Honey...
- Yeah.

11:22.926 --> 11:24.426
Don't forget your bowling shoes.

11:24.428 --> 11:26.211
Nah, they don't fit anymore.
They're too tight.

11:26.213 --> 11:29.047
Don't be so neurotic. I'll be fine.

11:29.049 --> 11:31.683
You bring me home a trophy.

11:34.604 --> 11:36.021
So how can I help?

11:36.023 --> 11:41.660
Well, in addition to
my poorly developing carrots...

11:42.663 --> 11:43.895
I have a slight fever,

11:43.897 --> 11:45.781
and I've also had
some joint pain lately.

11:45.783 --> 11:47.399
Do you have any allergies?

11:47.401 --> 11:50.285
Two. Cats and penicillin.

11:50.287 --> 11:51.753
Okay.

11:51.755 --> 11:53.955
And what prescription
medications are you taking?

11:53.957 --> 11:56.458
None. I've never really needed any.

11:56.460 --> 12:00.045
- Although my mother...
- Tell me about your mother.

12:00.047 --> 12:02.097
She was very judgmental, for one.

12:02.099 --> 12:03.181
Mm.

12:03.183 --> 12:05.050
And she had rheumatoid arthritis.

12:05.052 --> 12:08.470
It started when she was younger
than I am now.

12:08.472 --> 12:10.422
Within months of the diagnosis,

12:10.424 --> 12:12.307
my mother could barely leave the house.

12:12.309 --> 12:14.192
Well, just because a parent
has R.A. doesn't mean

12:14.194 --> 12:16.228
it will be passed along.

12:16.230 --> 12:19.114
So what do you think is wrong?

12:19.116 --> 12:20.532
I don't know yet,

12:20.534 --> 12:22.600
but I am going to do
everything I can to find out,

12:22.602 --> 12:25.654
starting with a blood draw
and some X-rays.

12:25.656 --> 12:27.772
And I'll be back later to follow up.

12:30.661 --> 12:33.211
Thank you for being so thorough

12:33.213 --> 12:34.463
and easy to work with.

12:34.465 --> 12:35.831
You guys are fantastic.

12:35.833 --> 12:37.249
- See you tomorrow.
- Thanks so much.

12:37.251 --> 12:39.217
Thank you. Bye.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.467
What did you forget? Oh.

12:55.469 --> 12:57.569
I thought you were somebody else.

12:57.571 --> 13:00.305
- Can I help you?
- I'm here for the auction.

13:00.307 --> 13:01.639
Oh, I'm sorry. It's not till tomorrow.

13:01.641 --> 13:03.475
- There's no preview?
- No.

13:03.477 --> 13:05.026
Oh, what a pity.

13:05.028 --> 13:06.661
I'm Milos Kuester-Ratenicz.

13:06.663 --> 13:09.865
Oh, Kuester-Ratenicz.
You're related to Boris?

13:09.867 --> 13:11.366
Yeah, he was my cousin.

13:11.368 --> 13:13.535
I'm Paige Lawson.

13:13.537 --> 13:15.420
You are related to Dr. Lawson?

13:15.422 --> 13:16.505
He's my brother-in-law.

13:16.507 --> 13:18.156
- Oh.
- It's nice to meet you.

13:18.158 --> 13:19.841
You too. You are here alone?

13:19.843 --> 13:22.511
I am, but I know the estate pretty well.

13:22.513 --> 13:24.012
Would you like to come inside?

13:24.014 --> 13:26.465
I would love.

13:46.224 --> 13:49.058
When I was young,

13:49.060 --> 13:52.895
this used to be in the house
in Kleinwalsertal.

13:52.897 --> 13:57.016
Oh, this used to be
my favorite hiding place

13:57.018 --> 13:59.202
when Boris and I used to play
hide-and-seek together.

13:59.204 --> 14:03.122
He was older than me,
indulged me, playing games,

14:03.124 --> 14:06.159
making up ghost stories.

14:08.246 --> 14:11.547
Telling me German fairy tales.

14:11.549 --> 14:12.715
That's really sweet.

14:12.717 --> 14:14.584
Not the way Boris told them.

14:38.526 --> 14:40.159
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

14:40.161 --> 14:42.195
- What's up?
- I'm in the driveway.

14:42.197 --> 14:43.996
I'm just stuck behind a stupid truck.

14:43.998 --> 14:45.081
The thing just broke down
right in front of me.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.065
It's unbelievable.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.667
- Babe, I got to go.
- Huh?

14:47.669 --> 14:49.702
Boris' cousin is here,
and I don't want to be rude.

14:49.704 --> 14:51.170
Okay. I'll see you later.

14:51.172 --> 14:52.738
Be careful with that knife.

14:52.740 --> 14:54.457
It's really sharp.

14:54.459 --> 14:56.408
Paige, listen to me.

14:56.410 --> 14:59.629
Paige. Paige!

14:59.631 --> 15:00.847
Oh, my God.

15:02.383 --> 15:03.749
Come on!

15:03.751 --> 15:05.017
- What?
- Say command.

15:05.019 --> 15:06.418
Call Hank.

15:09.557 --> 15:10.890
- Hey, Ev.
- Milos is at Shadow Pond

15:10.892 --> 15:12.424
with Paige right now, Henry.

15:12.426 --> 15:15.445
Milos is in the guest room resting.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.647
Where are you anyway?
Why aren't you at Shadow Pond?

15:17.649 --> 15:19.232
Boris wanted us to keep an eye on Milos,

15:19.234 --> 15:20.900
so I went to the spy shop,
I bought this clock radio

15:20.902 --> 15:22.368
with a built-in hidden camera,
but I'm too late.

15:22.370 --> 15:23.703
Hank, he's gonna kill my wife!

15:23.705 --> 15:25.488
Evan, you have to stop acting crazy.

15:25.490 --> 15:26.956
You're gonna blow this whole thing.

15:54.434 --> 15:56.819
Boris always loved to collect things,

15:56.821 --> 15:59.305
even when he was younger.

16:00.474 --> 16:01.491
- Evan?
- Oh, my God.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.860
Aah!

16:03.862 --> 16:05.661
- Oh, God.
- Look out.

16:05.663 --> 16:07.813
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, Milos.

16:07.815 --> 16:09.832
Evan, I looked... whoa, what happened?

16:09.834 --> 16:11.200
Why were you running like that?

16:11.202 --> 16:13.152
Milos, don't move yet.

16:13.154 --> 16:14.704
Are you hurt?

16:14.706 --> 16:17.089
My right knee.

16:17.091 --> 16:20.009
Okay, we need to get an X-ray.

16:21.462 --> 16:25.598
I will not go back into that wheelchair.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.183
I'm sorry.

16:27.185 --> 16:30.686
I'm so sorry, Milos.

16:37.178 --> 16:39.395
I'm sorry to call you back so soon.

16:39.397 --> 16:41.480
It's not a problem.

16:41.482 --> 16:44.066
How long have you been wheezing
like that?

16:44.068 --> 16:46.202
Maybe an hour.

16:46.204 --> 16:48.621
Your X-rays didn't show
any bone erosion,

16:48.623 --> 16:50.456
which would rule out R.A.,

16:50.458 --> 16:53.025
but we're still waiting
for your blood test results.

16:53.027 --> 16:56.495
In the meantime,
I want to do a skin biopsy.

16:56.497 --> 16:59.081
This could be
some kind of allergic reaction.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.133
But no rheumatoid arthritis?

17:01.135 --> 17:03.336
Bert will be so glad.

17:03.338 --> 17:04.587
Oh.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.472
How long have the two of you
been together?

17:06.473 --> 17:07.924
Oh, we were high school sweethearts.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.675
That is lovely.

17:09.676 --> 17:12.011
But we didn't stay together.

17:12.012 --> 17:13.846
Our parents didn't approve.

17:13.848 --> 17:16.933
Life pulled us in different directions.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.318
We married other people,

17:19.319 --> 17:21.069
had families,

17:21.071 --> 17:23.888
and both our spouses passed away.

17:23.891 --> 17:26.392
Then my grandson told me about Facebook.

17:26.394 --> 17:28.411
And when I looked,

17:28.413 --> 17:31.697
there he was, as handsome as ever.

17:31.699 --> 17:34.116
I sent him a friend request,

17:34.118 --> 17:36.919
and two weeks later, we were married.

17:36.921 --> 17:39.622
Well, that must have been
quite a friend request.

17:41.209 --> 17:44.844
Well, here's your trophy.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.295
- Participant?
- Hey.

17:46.297 --> 17:48.347
Don't worry about the fine print.

17:48.349 --> 17:49.682
How's my girl?

17:49.684 --> 17:51.517
Divya's doing a skin biopsy.

17:51.519 --> 17:53.269
I have a rash.

17:53.271 --> 17:56.755
She thinks it might be
an allergic reaction.

17:56.757 --> 17:58.257
I don't see any cats around.

17:58.259 --> 18:00.893
It's possible she's developed
an adult-onset allergy.

18:00.895 --> 18:03.029
I hope you're not gonna find
she's allergic to me.

18:03.031 --> 18:06.699
Maybe we should rule that out.
Come here, baby.

18:06.701 --> 18:09.601
Mwah.

18:09.603 --> 18:11.037
Anything?

18:11.039 --> 18:13.656
Well, my heart's beating
a little faster.

18:18.111 --> 18:19.611
You mentioned you saw a doctor earlier.

18:19.613 --> 18:21.380
Yeah, I had a little strep throat.

18:21.382 --> 18:24.667
- What did he prescribe you?
- Penicillin.

18:26.303 --> 18:27.837
Bea, you said that you were allergic

18:27.839 --> 18:29.505
to penicillin.

18:29.507 --> 18:30.806
I'm so sorry.

18:30.808 --> 18:33.342
I should have asked this earlier.

18:33.344 --> 18:37.763
Are you two sexually active?

18:37.765 --> 18:41.851
Are you saying that his penicillin is...

18:41.853 --> 18:43.903
Possibly being transferred to you.

18:45.573 --> 18:48.858
So I am allergic to you.

18:50.328 --> 18:51.694
Well, I've heard worse than that.

18:57.585 --> 18:59.702
Okay, we need to get you
something for that now.

19:03.708 --> 19:05.174
Bert, she's in respiratory distress.

19:05.176 --> 19:08.878
Call 911.

19:12.100 --> 19:17.636
Hang on, baby. You're gonna be fine.

19:17.638 --> 19:18.771
They're all done.
You guys can come in now.

19:18.773 --> 19:21.357
Okay.

19:21.359 --> 19:22.674
So good news.

19:22.676 --> 19:24.143
No broken bones.

19:24.145 --> 19:27.063
Oh, my God. That's great.

19:27.065 --> 19:28.614
Yeah.

19:28.616 --> 19:29.815
Milos, I just want to say I'm so sorry.

19:29.817 --> 19:31.283
No, no, no.

19:31.285 --> 19:33.369
I am sorry for being so short
with you earlier.

19:33.371 --> 19:35.037
Really?

19:35.039 --> 19:36.288
Milos, why don't you have
dinner with Evan and me tonight?

19:36.290 --> 19:38.157
In fact, you should stay at Shadow Pond.

19:38.159 --> 19:39.291
There's plenty of room.

19:39.293 --> 19:40.626
Well, you know what, actually...

19:40.628 --> 19:42.044
No, no, I would be delighted.

19:42.046 --> 19:44.630
And you, you didn't tell me
your lovely wife

19:44.632 --> 19:46.332
worked for the auction house.

19:46.334 --> 19:47.866
So you could help me buy in advance?

19:47.868 --> 19:50.636
Oh, I would love to help you,

19:50.638 --> 19:52.555
but unfortunately
Sutton and Chesterfield

19:52.557 --> 19:54.006
has a strict policy against that.

19:54.008 --> 19:56.258
Paige, he's a relative.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.709
I mean, couldn't you make an exception?

19:57.711 --> 19:59.345
I'm sorry.

19:59.347 --> 20:01.597
But since you're family, I could
get you on the guest list.

20:01.599 --> 20:04.683
That would be splendid. Thank you.

20:04.685 --> 20:06.018
Okay. Good.

20:06.020 --> 20:07.820
I'm just gonna need some signatures.

20:07.822 --> 20:09.688
Uh-huh.

20:09.690 --> 20:12.858
If I'm stable, why do I have
to stay in the hospital?

20:12.860 --> 20:15.161
We just want to keep an eye on
you, make sure nothing changes.

20:15.163 --> 20:18.531
And I'll just be a phone call away.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.450
Hey. What's up?

20:21.452 --> 20:23.452
Oh, our new patient Bea

20:23.454 --> 20:25.421
was admitted
for a severe allergic reaction

20:25.423 --> 20:26.738
to penicillin.

20:26.740 --> 20:27.757
Why was she prescribed penicillin?

20:27.759 --> 20:28.841
She wasn't.

20:28.843 --> 20:30.509
Her husband Bert was.

20:30.511 --> 20:32.628
He was giving it to her.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.847
Why was he giving it to her?

20:34.849 --> 20:38.750
He wasn't giving it to her.

20:38.752 --> 20:42.138
He was... he was <i>giving</i> it to her.

20:42.140 --> 20:45.107
Oh. Okay. All right, Bert.

20:45.109 --> 20:48.811
Oh, Divya, meet Milos, Boris' cousin.

20:48.813 --> 20:50.196
Divya's our P.A.

20:50.198 --> 20:51.597
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

20:51.599 --> 20:54.099
Are you coming to dinner as well?

20:54.101 --> 20:55.534
Oh, she's busy with patients,

20:55.536 --> 20:57.319
so she can't.

20:57.321 --> 21:00.272
What a shame.

21:02.610 --> 21:03.909
- So, Milos...
- Mm.

21:03.911 --> 21:05.461
Tell me about Budapest.

21:05.463 --> 21:06.545
I hear it's an amazing city.

21:06.547 --> 21:08.247
It is exceptional.

21:08.249 --> 21:09.965
The Danube is particularly beautiful.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.301
- Can you pass the bread?
- Yes, of course.

21:12.303 --> 21:13.669
Thank you.

21:13.671 --> 21:15.120
A toast, hmm? Cheers.

21:15.122 --> 21:16.672
- Yes.
- <i>Salute,</i>

21:16.674 --> 21:18.624
- as they say in Italy.
- <i>Salute.</i>

21:18.626 --> 21:20.643
And good wine.

21:20.645 --> 21:22.794
Do you need anything else, sir?

21:22.796 --> 21:24.230
No, we're fine.

21:24.232 --> 21:26.015
- Everything's wonderful, Udo.
- Very well.

21:26.017 --> 21:28.517
Thank you.

21:28.519 --> 21:30.319
This wine is excellent.

21:30.321 --> 21:32.321
Ah. Very, very good.

21:32.323 --> 21:34.607
That's not my point.

21:34.609 --> 21:37.643
Udo, please come in.

21:37.645 --> 21:40.079
- Welcome home, sir.
<i>- Danke schon.</i>

21:40.081 --> 21:41.530
<i>- Bitte schon.</i>
<i>- It's good to be back.</i>

21:41.532 --> 21:43.649
What I'm trying to say is Milos is here.

21:43.651 --> 21:45.417
Why not just have him arrested?

21:45.419 --> 21:46.919
Because he is here, Hank.

21:46.921 --> 21:49.421
I understand why going through
with the auction is tantalizing,

21:49.423 --> 21:52.491
but this auction was never
supposed to actually happen.

21:52.493 --> 21:55.261
Whatever Milos wants is here
at Shadow Pond.

21:55.263 --> 21:56.512
He could be quite dangerous, yes?

21:56.514 --> 21:58.514
- Yeah.
- You know my family's history...

21:58.516 --> 22:01.050
armaments, chemicals,
not always to good purpose.

22:08.509 --> 22:10.476
My grandfather built
this entire house himself,

22:10.478 --> 22:13.812
all 109,000 square feet of it.

22:13.814 --> 22:15.847
Even I don't know all of its secrets.

22:15.849 --> 22:19.017
Boris, Milos was never
supposed to get this close.

22:19.019 --> 22:20.486
You're putting innocent people at risk,

22:20.488 --> 22:21.704
people I care about.

22:21.706 --> 22:24.990
I know. I know.

22:36.753 --> 22:40.339
We are going to expose Milos' agenda

22:40.341 --> 22:43.309
and put an end to his bloodshed.

22:55.150 --> 22:57.702
Test, test. Okay.

22:57.704 --> 23:00.622
Let's go over the checklist.

23:00.624 --> 23:02.990
- Number one.
- Record every bid you announce.

23:02.992 --> 23:04.208
Number two.

23:04.210 --> 23:05.826
Pay close attention to the side bank

23:05.828 --> 23:07.428
because bids will be coming in remotely

23:07.430 --> 23:09.013
via telephone and Internet.

23:09.015 --> 23:11.049
- Three.
- When an item is sold,

23:11.051 --> 23:13.851
enter the final price quickly
and accurately.

23:13.853 --> 23:17.689
And what do you do
if at any point in the auction

23:17.691 --> 23:19.006
you lose track of the bidding?

23:19.008 --> 23:22.360
II don't know.

23:22.362 --> 23:24.312
Then don't lose track of the bidding.

23:24.314 --> 23:26.147
- Right.
- Excuse me.

23:26.149 --> 23:28.616
Mrs. Lawson.
And you must be the auctioneer.

23:28.618 --> 23:30.702
Russel Berger. And you are?

23:30.704 --> 23:32.704
Milos Kuester-Ratenicz.

23:32.706 --> 23:34.188
Of course.

23:34.190 --> 23:36.958
How can I help you,
Mr. Kuester-Ratenicz?

23:36.960 --> 23:38.743
I was wondering if I could make

23:38.745 --> 23:39.994
a bid anonymously.

23:39.996 --> 23:42.530
Absolutely. I'll act as your proxy.

23:43.882 --> 23:46.834
Just indicate what you're interested in

23:46.836 --> 23:48.369
and your maximum bid.

23:48.371 --> 23:50.171
Of course you can also bid remotely

23:50.173 --> 23:51.706
either by phone or online.

23:51.708 --> 23:53.308
That way, you're both anonymous,

23:53.310 --> 23:55.593
and you can be certain
you're not outbid.

23:55.595 --> 23:57.845
Even better. I can leave now.

23:57.847 --> 23:59.347
Thank you.

23:59.349 --> 24:00.815
Milos, I thought you were excited

24:00.817 --> 24:02.817
about attending the auction.

24:02.819 --> 24:05.436
I was forgetting myself
in my enthusiasm.

24:05.438 --> 24:07.555
Sometimes with items of great value,

24:07.557 --> 24:11.743
it's better to conceal one's interest.

24:11.745 --> 24:16.247
Thank you again for your hospitality.

24:16.249 --> 24:19.334
Hey, Bert. You ready to go visit Bea?

24:19.336 --> 24:20.752
Give me a minute.

24:20.754 --> 24:24.172
I just wanted to bring her
some strawberries.

24:24.174 --> 24:27.375
Everything okay?

24:27.377 --> 24:29.910
Yeah. Hands are a little stiff today.

24:29.912 --> 24:33.381
These old bones and joints
are fighting me.

24:33.383 --> 24:36.050
You mentioned the other day
that your lawn bowling shoes

24:36.052 --> 24:37.135
had gotten too tight.

24:37.137 --> 24:39.253
Yeah, my feet are old too.

24:39.255 --> 24:41.139
Bert, can I see your hands?

24:41.141 --> 24:43.224
Ow.

24:43.226 --> 24:45.476
Ooh.

24:45.478 --> 24:46.594
It was a little uncomfortable,

24:46.596 --> 24:48.429
but I just thought it was old age.

24:48.431 --> 24:50.565
Isn't that what you accused
your former doctor of doing?

24:50.567 --> 24:52.033
Mm-hmm.

24:52.035 --> 24:53.201
This ring needs to come off now.

24:53.203 --> 24:56.654
Ow!

24:59.208 --> 25:02.377
Ooh. Ah.

25:07.949 --> 25:10.718
Okay, perfect.

25:16.008 --> 25:17.975
Sorry.

25:19.728 --> 25:21.179
Okay.

25:22.731 --> 25:25.650
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

25:30.356 --> 25:34.275
Ow! Ooh.

25:37.414 --> 25:39.030
What is wrong with me?

25:39.032 --> 25:40.448
I think that you have

25:40.450 --> 25:41.982
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

25:41.984 --> 25:44.452
I'd like to buy a vowel.

25:44.454 --> 25:45.620
It's a kidney disorder

25:45.622 --> 25:47.622
that can occur after a strep infection.

25:47.624 --> 25:50.091
Your blood vessels get inflamed

25:50.093 --> 25:51.992
and make your kidneys
less able to do their job,

25:51.994 --> 25:53.594
which causes swelling and joint pain.

25:53.596 --> 25:57.014
It looks like Bea's going
to have a new roommate tonight.

25:57.016 --> 25:58.099
Oh.

26:05.974 --> 26:08.109
Milos, where are you going?

26:08.111 --> 26:09.444
I have business to attend to.

26:09.446 --> 26:10.778
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:10.780 --> 26:12.113
I was hoping to do another blood draw.

26:12.115 --> 26:14.115
Your CPK level's a little high.

26:14.117 --> 26:15.283
I'm concerned it may affect

26:15.285 --> 26:16.567
your eligibility for the trial.

26:16.569 --> 26:17.852
But as you pointed out yourself,

26:17.854 --> 26:19.353
the trial comes with no guarantees.

26:19.355 --> 26:20.905
Still, I think it's your best shot.

26:20.907 --> 26:22.373
It is not possible.

26:22.375 --> 26:25.376
I will follow up
with my doctor back home.

26:25.378 --> 26:28.496
Don't worry, Hank.
Everything will be fine.

26:28.498 --> 26:29.547
Hank!

26:29.549 --> 26:30.915
There's been an accident.

26:30.917 --> 26:32.133
It's Russel.

26:32.135 --> 26:33.968
The auctioneer. Let's go.

26:39.141 --> 26:40.675
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:40.677 --> 26:41.542
I was in the other room,
I heard a loud crash,

26:41.544 --> 26:42.927
and found him like that.

26:42.929 --> 26:44.712
Russel?

26:47.432 --> 26:50.067
Russel?

26:54.406 --> 26:56.023
What happened?

26:56.025 --> 26:58.893
Russel, it's Dr. Lawson.

26:58.895 --> 27:01.329
You had an accident
and lost consciousness.

27:01.331 --> 27:03.581
Please don't move your neck.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.700
I need to check your pupils.

27:07.669 --> 27:08.703
Okay.

27:08.705 --> 27:11.255
Look straight up for me.

27:11.257 --> 27:12.340
That's it.

27:12.342 --> 27:15.843
Good.

27:15.845 --> 27:18.546
Okay, he needs a CT.
I think he has a concussion.

27:18.548 --> 27:19.797
I called the ambulance already.

27:19.799 --> 27:21.098
Good.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.049
So the auction, it will be delayed?

27:22.051 --> 27:23.351
No.

27:23.353 --> 27:25.419
The reputation
of Sutton and Chesterfield

27:25.421 --> 27:26.854
is at stake.

27:26.856 --> 27:28.272
Paige can take over.

27:28.274 --> 27:30.107
- She can?
- Do you know every item?

27:30.109 --> 27:31.392
Backwards and forwards.

27:31.394 --> 27:33.594
Then you can.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.286
Good afternoon.

27:53.288 --> 27:54.471
I am pleased to announce

27:54.473 --> 27:56.806
that despite Mr. Berger's recent injury,

27:56.808 --> 27:59.926
the auction will continue as planned.

28:01.129 --> 28:02.795
However, due to the constraints

28:02.797 --> 28:04.431
of limited personnel,

28:04.433 --> 28:06.900
remote bidding can
no longer be accommodated.

28:06.902 --> 28:09.019
I must apologize in advance.

28:09.021 --> 28:12.072
I'm not nearly as seasoned
an auctioneer as Mr. Berger.

28:12.074 --> 28:14.441
Fortunately, the items up for bid today

28:14.443 --> 28:16.976
speak for themselves.

28:16.978 --> 28:18.995
Lot number one is

28:18.997 --> 28:22.282
a limited edition ebony, bone,
and manta ray skin humidor,

28:22.284 --> 28:24.501
handmade in 1986

28:24.503 --> 28:26.620
to celebrate the 20th anniversary

28:26.622 --> 28:27.754
of the Cohiba brand.

28:27.756 --> 28:29.822
And $12,000 to start it.

28:29.824 --> 28:31.508
12,000.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.960
12,500. 13,000.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.045
13,000.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.046
13,500.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.714
Do I have 14,000? 14,000.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.665
Well, Evan looks less nervous.

28:38.667 --> 28:40.267
14,500.

28:40.269 --> 28:41.601
I think he's finally settled down.

28:41.603 --> 28:44.804
- 15,000.
- Just in time.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.172
15,000 against you, sir.

28:46.174 --> 28:48.892
Selling then. Fair warning at 15,000.

28:49.945 --> 28:51.778
Sold.

28:51.780 --> 28:54.614
This pair of
singing bird pistols from 1820

28:54.616 --> 28:57.233
attributed to freres Rochat,
must be considered

28:57.235 --> 28:59.452
one of the most amazing
mechanical works of art

28:59.454 --> 29:01.454
for any collector.

29:01.456 --> 29:03.856
We'll start the bidding
for this extremely rare item

29:03.858 --> 29:05.542
at $1.2 million.

29:05.544 --> 29:06.543
1.2.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.712
1.3. 1.4.

29:15.002 --> 29:16.369
Our next item,

29:16.371 --> 29:19.422
lot number 37 is a magnificent Bechstein

29:19.424 --> 29:21.841
French Louis XV style grand piano

29:21.843 --> 29:22.926
with ormolu mounts.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.928
Numbered 20475

29:24.930 --> 29:27.714
for the date 1888 in mint condition,

29:27.716 --> 29:30.350
being offered with bench
and matching metronome.

29:30.352 --> 29:34.854
We'll start the bidding at $185,000.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.190
185,000. Do I have 190,000?

29:37.192 --> 29:38.408
He's bidding on the piano.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.693
- Why?
- 190,000.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.894
- I don't know.
- 190,000 on my left.

29:41.896 --> 29:44.197
195,000. 200,000.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.582
But that's what he wants.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.784
200,000, ma'am? No?

29:47.786 --> 29:48.918
Fair warning.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.904
Selling then for $195,000.

29:51.906 --> 29:53.573
Sold.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.292
Why don't we go ask him?

29:56.294 --> 29:58.595
- Yeah.
- Lot number 38

29:58.597 --> 30:00.513
is a vintage ornate candelabrum

30:00.515 --> 30:03.633
produced based on a design by Al-Jazari.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.553
We'll begin the bidding at $17,000.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.921
- 17,000. Do I have 18,000?
- Wait.

30:08.923 --> 30:12.025
18,000. 18,500.

30:12.027 --> 30:14.644
19,000. Do I have 20,000?

30:14.646 --> 30:18.264
Selling then, fair warning, at $19,000.

30:18.266 --> 30:20.400
Sold.

30:22.436 --> 30:24.204
Do I have 165,000?

30:24.206 --> 30:26.206
165,000. 175,000.

30:26.208 --> 30:28.208
185,000. 195,000.

30:28.210 --> 30:29.909
Sold.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.294
30,000.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.213
35,000. Sold.

30:33.215 --> 30:34.947
70,000? 70,000.

30:34.949 --> 30:36.833
Selling then at $70,000.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.787
Selling then, fair warning, at $450,000.

30:40.789 --> 30:42.972
45,000. 50,000 is on my right.

30:42.974 --> 30:44.557
Sold.

30:44.559 --> 30:45.809
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:45.811 --> 30:47.644
we are going to take a 30-minute break.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.629
There are refreshments on the terrace.

30:49.631 --> 30:51.431
For those of you who would
like to collect your items,

30:51.433 --> 30:54.434
please see the cashier.

31:21.011 --> 31:23.379
Okay, here's your last item, Milos.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.381
Shut the door.

31:28.886 --> 31:30.270
Congratulations.

31:30.272 --> 31:33.306
You've acquired
some really wonderful pieces.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.225
Am I wasting my time here?

31:35.227 --> 31:38.611
I'm not sure I understand
what you're asking.

31:38.613 --> 31:40.730
When you researched
the provenance on these items,

31:40.732 --> 31:42.449
how thoroughly did you inspect them?

31:42.451 --> 31:44.016
We were very thorough.

31:44.018 --> 31:46.986
No, you.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.572
You were thorough.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.824
So you could have tampered with them,

31:50.826 --> 31:52.492
removed items of value.

31:52.494 --> 31:55.578
I can assure you that all of the items

31:55.580 --> 31:59.632
are in their original condition.

31:59.634 --> 32:03.670
Is there something specific
that seems to be missing?

32:03.672 --> 32:05.305
How is it that you and your husband

32:05.307 --> 32:07.974
managed to move into this house
at the very same time

32:07.976 --> 32:11.878
your company was engaged
to auction the estate?

32:21.071 --> 32:23.857
How did that come to pass?

32:26.076 --> 32:27.110
Oh, there you are.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.444
Sorry to interrupt,

32:28.446 --> 32:29.445
but they're looking for you.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.413
They're going crazy down there.

32:30.415 --> 32:32.332
They need you for something.

32:32.334 --> 32:34.083
I hope your purchases
in the next session

32:34.085 --> 32:35.752
will be more pleasing.

32:35.754 --> 32:39.422
We have some rare items coming up.

32:50.718 --> 32:53.303
What is he doing?

32:53.305 --> 32:57.140
What the hell?

32:57.142 --> 32:58.892
That is intriguing.

32:58.894 --> 33:00.226
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:00.228 --> 33:01.477
please take your seats.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.147
The auction will resume
in just a few minutes.

33:29.456 --> 33:32.425
Is there a pattern we're not seeing?

33:34.345 --> 33:37.597
What is Milos expecting
to find in these items?

33:40.067 --> 33:42.268
Time.

33:42.270 --> 33:46.305
That was a Chinese incense clock.

33:46.307 --> 33:48.441
There is a grandfather clock.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.326
The antique candelabrum kept time

33:50.328 --> 33:51.527
through the melting of wax.

33:51.529 --> 33:52.779
The metronome is a timepiece as well.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.781
It's all time.

33:54.783 --> 33:57.917
But what would you keep inside a clock?

33:57.919 --> 34:01.588
I don't...

34:01.590 --> 34:03.339
The Count of St. Germain.

34:03.341 --> 34:05.091
The who of what?

34:05.093 --> 34:06.926
The Count of St. Germain,

34:06.928 --> 34:10.045
it's an old Bavarian myth.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.598
It's a folk tale.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.801
I used to tell it to Milos
when he was a child.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.219
It's about a magic elixir,

34:16.221 --> 34:17.553
which when stored inside of a clock,

34:17.554 --> 34:18.972
promised immortality.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.107
He used to beg me to tell it
over and over again.

34:21.109 --> 34:23.976
He once asked
if it could cure his father.

34:23.978 --> 34:27.146
The genetic disease can affect
bones and muscles,

34:27.148 --> 34:29.649
- but the third element is...
- Dementia.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.199
Milos wasn't trying to leave
because he's suspicious.

34:31.202 --> 34:33.119
He was leaving because he's delusional.

34:33.121 --> 34:34.687
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.292
Lot number 71.

34:39.293 --> 34:41.293
Although this simple Biedermeier cuckoo

34:41.295 --> 34:44.030
with alabaster columns looks unassuming,

34:44.032 --> 34:45.882
it's historically quite significant.

34:45.884 --> 34:50.085
It was made
by Johann Baptist Beha in 1842

34:50.088 --> 34:51.871
when he was 27 years old.

34:51.873 --> 34:55.308
We'll start the bidding at $50,000.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.877
$50,000. Do I have 55,000?

34:57.879 --> 35:00.146
55,000. Do I have 60,000?

35:00.148 --> 35:01.731
$60,000.

35:01.733 --> 35:05.018
65,000. Do I have 75,000?

35:05.020 --> 35:06.319
75,000 in the back.

35:06.321 --> 35:09.572
75,000 against you, sir.

35:09.574 --> 35:11.574
$150,000.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.493
$150,000.

35:13.495 --> 35:18.114
Do I have an advance on 150,000?

35:18.116 --> 35:21.084
Selling then, fair warning, at 150,000.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.336
$1 million.

35:36.249 --> 35:37.717
Boris.

35:44.424 --> 35:47.060
You do have the cure,

35:47.062 --> 35:49.428
and you have kept it for yourself.

36:04.111 --> 36:06.746
They got him.

36:06.748 --> 36:09.499
Thanks to you.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.884
Get him up.

36:13.587 --> 36:15.304
Get out of my house, Milos.

36:15.306 --> 36:17.924
Go on.

36:20.728 --> 36:23.896
Nice work, guys. Nice work.

36:23.898 --> 36:25.314
Everyone did a great job.

36:25.316 --> 36:28.634
Call in the bureau.

36:38.420 --> 36:39.770
Looks like your test results

36:39.772 --> 36:41.722
have confirmed glomerulonephritis.

36:41.724 --> 36:43.224
Hmm.

36:43.226 --> 36:45.226
Well, I can scratch that
off my bucket list.

36:46.529 --> 36:48.446
You'll continue on I.V. antibiotics

36:48.448 --> 36:49.947
until the swelling goes down,

36:49.949 --> 36:52.650
and you can leave once your
blood pressure's under control.

36:52.652 --> 36:54.619
And I was told I'd be discharged

36:54.621 --> 36:56.287
- this afternoon?
- That's right.

36:56.289 --> 36:59.207
And you'll continue taking Prednisone.

36:59.209 --> 37:01.942
I'd advise that you wait
two or three days

37:01.944 --> 37:06.464
before you resume
any intimate relations.

37:06.466 --> 37:08.216
Which is it, two or three?

37:09.469 --> 37:11.168
Oh, I still can't believe

37:11.170 --> 37:13.170
the mere mention of a pair

37:13.172 --> 37:15.789
of lawn bowling shoes saved Bert's life.

37:15.791 --> 37:17.592
Well, Hankmed is sensitive

37:17.594 --> 37:19.260
to its patients and their needs.

37:19.262 --> 37:21.962
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:23.432 --> 37:26.901
I know you feel bad
about not asking about sex,

37:26.903 --> 37:29.637
but you shouldn't.

37:29.639 --> 37:33.407
It wasn't about your age.

37:33.409 --> 37:35.276
It's about this time in my life.

37:35.278 --> 37:39.830
It's about me
and what's missing for now.

37:39.832 --> 37:42.917
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

37:42.919 --> 37:45.586
Life is long and wonderful.

37:45.588 --> 37:46.837
It ebbs and flows

37:46.839 --> 37:48.822
like the perennials in my garden.

37:48.824 --> 37:52.126
Sometimes they're in bloom,
sometimes they're not,

37:52.128 --> 37:54.845
but they're always alive.

37:54.847 --> 37:57.381
So I'm going through a dormant period.

37:57.383 --> 37:58.766
Exactly.

37:58.768 --> 38:00.851
- Hmm.
- Things change.

38:02.971 --> 38:05.690
Unexpected things happen.

38:10.846 --> 38:11.845
You make sure I know that information

38:11.847 --> 38:13.230
- when you get it, yes?
- Okay.

38:13.232 --> 38:16.200
So this whole nightmare,
all the intrigue,

38:16.202 --> 38:20.237
everything was
'cause Milos is delusional?

38:20.239 --> 38:21.739
Looks that way.

38:21.741 --> 38:23.407
I'm just glad you decided

38:23.409 --> 38:25.326
not to listen to me
and told Paige everything.

38:25.328 --> 38:27.662
Otherwise, Milos might have
slipped through our fingers.

38:27.664 --> 38:30.247
Boris, I know I promised not
to say anything,

38:30.249 --> 38:32.917
but when I saw my wife
getting in deeper and deeper,

38:32.919 --> 38:35.336
I... I didn't know what else to do.

38:35.338 --> 38:36.470
I couldn't take the chance that she...

38:36.472 --> 38:38.255
He was <i>giving</i> it to her.

38:38.257 --> 38:40.308
Oh. Okay.

38:40.310 --> 38:42.093
All right, Bert.

38:42.095 --> 38:44.762
Oh, Divya, meet Milos.

38:44.764 --> 38:45.896
Milos, this is Divya. Our P.A.

38:45.898 --> 38:47.181
I have to tell you something.

38:47.183 --> 38:48.232
Are you coming to dinner as well?

38:48.234 --> 38:50.217
It's about Milos.

38:52.220 --> 38:54.322
<i>Salute. Cheers.</i>

38:54.324 --> 38:55.856
You can also bid remotely,

38:55.858 --> 38:58.109
either by phone or online.

38:58.111 --> 39:00.861
That way, you're both anonymous,

39:00.863 --> 39:02.830
and you can be certain
you're not outbid.

39:02.832 --> 39:03.864
Even better.

39:03.866 --> 39:06.900
And then Milos said he was leaving.

39:06.902 --> 39:08.669
Well, we're going to have
to figure out a way

39:08.671 --> 39:10.204
to keep him from going.

39:10.206 --> 39:12.423
I'll follow up with my doctor back home.

39:12.425 --> 39:15.459
Don't worry, Hank.
Everything will be fine.

39:16.511 --> 39:18.713
Hank!

39:18.715 --> 39:20.514
It's Russel. There's been an accident.

39:20.516 --> 39:22.967
The auctioneer. Let's go.

39:24.853 --> 39:27.021
It's go time. Are you ready?

39:27.023 --> 39:28.356
As long as Boris doesn't forget

39:28.358 --> 39:31.108
people who do favors for him,
then I'm ready.

39:38.567 --> 39:40.934
There's no need for an apology, Evan.

39:40.936 --> 39:43.404
Given the outcome,
I think we can consider

39:43.406 --> 39:45.606
this endeavor a success,

39:45.608 --> 39:48.459
perhaps because we all trusted
the right people.

39:48.461 --> 39:49.710
Excuse me.

39:49.712 --> 39:52.496
Great work, Paige. You too.

39:55.084 --> 39:57.168
Oh, my God.

39:57.170 --> 39:58.886
- That was amazing.
- I know.

39:58.888 --> 40:00.388
All those people.

40:00.390 --> 40:02.223
They had to make
the auction look real, right?

40:02.225 --> 40:03.290
When you're Boris,
you can afford to hire

40:03.292 --> 40:05.059
the entire security firm.

40:05.061 --> 40:07.228
- You were great.
- You were great.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.263
No, you... okay, we were both great.

40:09.265 --> 40:11.649
Just especially you.

40:11.651 --> 40:13.017
Thank you for helping.

40:13.019 --> 40:15.603
Well, I help because it was important

40:15.605 --> 40:17.655
to Hank, to Boris,

40:17.657 --> 40:19.824
but most importantly, to you.

40:19.826 --> 40:22.943
And I would have helped you

40:22.945 --> 40:25.312
had you told me
when you first found out.

40:25.314 --> 40:27.415
A man's life was at stake.

40:27.417 --> 40:28.699
No, I totally get that,

40:28.701 --> 40:32.036
and I understand how important that is.

40:32.038 --> 40:35.155
But I still wish you would've told me.

40:35.157 --> 40:36.674
I hated it, Paige,

40:36.676 --> 40:38.325
but Hank made me promise
not to tell you.

40:38.327 --> 40:40.878
Well, shouldn't you decide
what I deserve to know?

40:55.110 --> 40:57.978
We are blood, Boris. Share the cure.

40:57.980 --> 41:00.981
Mila...

41:03.952 --> 41:05.369
<i>Cousin...</i>

41:05.371 --> 41:08.038
There is no cure.

41:09.324 --> 41:11.909
The cure is a fairy tale,

41:11.911 --> 41:14.795
like the Count of St. Germain.

41:14.797 --> 41:16.630
You tried to kill me,

41:16.632 --> 41:19.366
to kill my family, you murdered Dima

41:19.368 --> 41:21.502
for something that never existed.

41:21.504 --> 41:25.389
It does not exist.

41:33.682 --> 41:36.150
You're a liar.

41:56.588 --> 41:57.905
It's over, Hank.

41:57.907 --> 41:59.507
Hopefully, this is the end

41:59.509 --> 42:04.011
of generations of violence in my family.

42:04.013 --> 42:06.630
And a new beginning for you.

42:09.301 --> 42:12.303
We shall see.
