a good party.

All parties are good

00:37.505 --> 00:39.271

and before 3:00.

00:51.052 --> 00:54.119
Do you think Sarah Louise
drinks too much?

00:54.121 --> 00:55.154
You were counting?

00:55.156 --> 00:58.624
I'm just jealous.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.592
I can't touch a drop

01:00.594 --> 01:02.661
if we're really going
to start trying.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.596
You really want to?

01:04.598 --> 01:06.632
Don't you?

01:06.634 --> 01:10.135
As long as I don't have
to do the 2:00 feeding.

01:22.149 --> 01:25.117

My brother, he say ain't
no woman good enough for him.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.197

Can she talk?

03:47.595 --> 03:48.961
Yeah, at the hospital.

03:48.963 --> 03:51.830
Yeah, the good citizens
outside, they heard screams.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.565
Yean, and they fell
all over each other,

03:53.567 --> 03:54.833
trying to help, right?

03:54.835 --> 03:56.418
Robbery?

03:56.419 --> 03:58.002
Her purse was empty,
and his wallet's gone.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.606
It's probably in a garbage can
a block away. I.D.?

Car registration.

04:02.276 --> 04:05.644
Ralston, Janet, Alan.

They live a block away.

In the stairwell,

Still warm.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.251
Witnesses?

04:12.253 --> 04:14.286
32 Of them,
all blind.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.354
Car like that?

04:15.356 --> 04:17.623
They should have bought
a clunker

04:17.625 --> 04:19.925
and spent the money
on a better neighborhood.

04:19.927 --> 04:23.795
Or one at least more than a
block from a police precinct.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.598
Those people,
how much paper they got?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.400
A couple hundred grand?

04:28.402 --> 04:30.736
I was them,
I'd have me a driver.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.638
You don't even
have a car.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.772
If I had a car.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.774
And if I did,
it wouldn't be no Lincoln.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.410
Ladies, you see
anybody at all?

04:38.412 --> 04:41.380
No, I ain't hear nothing,
I ain't seen nothing.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.948
That's what
she's good at, nothing.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.385
He was black.
A kid.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.587
Came out that door
running.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.355
You get a look
at him?

04:52.059 --> 04:58.297
Designated driver says
he saw a kid.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.372
How many fingers?

05:08.876 --> 05:10.375
Three.

WOMAN OVER P.A.:
<i> Dr. Ostroski to Room 408.</i>

05:19.386 --> 05:21.953
Mrs. Ralston
was very lucky.

05:21.955 --> 05:22.954
Lucky?

05:22.956 --> 05:24.389
She lost her husband.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.658
Well, let's say her children
were lucky, then.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.926
At least she's
still around.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.095
When can we get a
description
from her?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.797
As soon as she wakes up,
I would think.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.700
So the wounds
weren't serious, then.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.935
Defense wound
to the forearm

05:36.937 --> 05:38.704
and one
to the left gluteus maximus.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.740
Last year, Janet was mugged.
Central Park.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.842
Ardsley, Hastings...

05:43.844 --> 05:46.878
she wanted to move
somewhere up the Hudson.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.014
Someplace
with a backyard.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.751
The city's no place
to raise a family anymore.

05:52.753 --> 05:57.389
Just last week I was getting
their finances in order.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.792
They wanted to move
before the third kid.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.127
Alan's mother.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.101
I called, uh... I called Denise,
the baby-sitter.

06:09.103 --> 06:11.069
She's taking care
of the kids.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.739
You were with the children
last night?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.142
Those poor babies.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.111
Without Alan...

06:22.750 --> 06:23.915
Excuse me.

a list of the stuff

06:35.062 --> 06:37.829
they were carrying--
jewelry, credit cards?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.732
I'll have it to you
first thing in the morning.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.039
$50,000

06:48.041 --> 06:50.942
leading to the arrest
and conviction

06:50.944 --> 06:53.412
of whoever killed
Alan Ralston.

06:53.414 --> 06:57.916
I'll have my lawyer notify
the papers in the morning.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.787
50 grand.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.723
If that's what it took
to get a killer,

07:04.725 --> 07:08.927
they'd get rid of us and use
our salaries as rewards.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.831
Couldn't look worse.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.434
GREEVEY:
Could have happened
in front of the precinct.

telepathy with badges.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.473
Oh, really?
Well, I'm telepathic,

07:21.475 --> 07:23.459
and this is the message
I'm sending.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.444
I don't like looking
like a freaking incompetent!

07:25.446 --> 07:29.481
The message I'm getting is
that we're at a dead end.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.149
30 people on the street.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.518
The only good citizen
to come forward is a wino.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.754
Well, then you squeeze him
for everything he's got.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.857
Then you interview
everybody who was on
the street that night.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.193
Then you interview everybody
who lives on the street.

07:41.195 --> 07:43.195
Are you getting the picture?

07:43.197 --> 07:44.930
(<i> door slams</i> )

07:46.133 --> 07:48.033
Shelters...

07:48.035 --> 07:49.968
rather sleep on the street.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.470
Company's better.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.872
No room service, though.

Him.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.208
Maybe.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.846
Yup.

Same guy. Twice.

Willie Tivnan.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.486
You want to buy me a drink?

08:08.522 --> 08:11.890
Mr. Tivnan has a scar
on his thumb.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.492
Cut himself deep once.

Fancy gun
for the street.

08:25.906 --> 08:26.905
My guess?

08:26.907 --> 08:29.574
He didn't go
to Italy to buy it.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.795
Willie got
an armed robbery?

08:32.796 --> 08:34.513
Twice with knives.

Hotel! Well,now we know
where he got the Beretta.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.218
Nothing with guns.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.654
Four juvenile
detention facilities.

popped at the same location.

another trip.

I hear somebody
coming down.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.067
I figure it's the Rican,

10:36.069 --> 10:37.369
but then I hear shots.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.404
You know, one, then two more.

Bam, bam!

Alan was coming around
the front of the car

10:53.220 --> 10:55.186
to open my door.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.355
I got out of the car.

10:57.357 --> 11:01.192
I gave him a kiss.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.763
I noticed there were
some flowers in the back seat.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.233
I asked him to get the flowers.

11:08.235 --> 11:11.336
He opened the back door.

11:11.338 --> 11:15.674
He was looking for something
in his pocket.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.109
He said, "Did you lock it?"

11:18.111 --> 11:20.712
The car, he meant.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.348
I turned to look.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.151
He went towards the stairwell.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.353
The door opened.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.288
A man came out...

11:30.290 --> 11:32.424
black.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.228
I didn't see a gun.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.397
I heard the shot

11:39.399 --> 11:43.334
and saw the look
on Alan's face

11:43.336 --> 11:46.337
like he'd been punched.

Logan is finishing up
the last one now.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.692
The first seven?

He never killed anybody.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.906
His M.O.?
He uses a knife.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.441
He was in there
smoking crack.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.810
but he didn't
kill Ralston?

The defendant is indigent,
Miss Strickland, is that right?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.475
Yes, Your Honor, and the
public defendant's office

13:30.477 --> 13:32.544
feel strongly
that the facts do not
warrant these charges.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.529
Without and indictment...

13:34.530 --> 13:36.513
ROBINETTE:
Your Honor, we feel
there's sufficient evidence.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.817
Also, the defendant
has previous convictions,

13:38.819 --> 13:41.352
and has missed
two court appearances.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.488
It's two
violent felonies,

13:43.490 --> 13:45.490
and one of them
a homicide.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.959
And the defendant
has no known residence.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.830
Bail is set at $100,000.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.832
JUDGE:
Next case.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.068
BAILIFF:
Docket #94628.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.838
People vs Pike...
Where's your boss?

13:59.840 --> 14:01.506
You think he shows up
for the arraignment
of every two-bit

14:01.508 --> 14:03.508
crackhead
who's dead-bang guilty?

14:03.510 --> 14:06.511
No one is guilty
until the verdict comes in.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.379
Look, I talked
to Tivnan.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.848
He's copped to
the eight muggings.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.382
He did those,
he admits it,

14:11.384 --> 14:13.518
but he didn't
kill Ralston.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.520
Come on, Elizabeth.
Come on.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.521
You don't have
a positive I.D.
from Janet Ralston.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.424
He doesn't use guns.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.526
Stone's not gonna
deal on this one.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.396
The public doesn't like
getting killed coming home.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.531
I do this a lot.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.533
This kid's
telling the truth.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.869
Well, I hope for your sake,
you're wrong,

14:30.871 --> 14:33.605
'cause everybody else
on Manhattan Island
thinks he did it.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.079
Wrapped up.

14:41.081 --> 14:44.148
Another killer
off the streets.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.085
Hey, Max,

14:47.087 --> 14:48.620
we'll find the gun.

14:48.622 --> 14:51.055
Willie Tivnan has a rap sheet

14:51.057 --> 14:54.359
as long as
the<i> Encyclopedia Britannica.</i>

14:54.361 --> 14:56.561
And no mention
of him ever

14:56.563 --> 14:58.496
using a gun.

14:58.498 --> 15:02.066
You just think I'm wrong
because I'm sure I'm right.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.636
I think that
he's a street-wise little kid.

15:04.638 --> 15:06.571
Who shot two people for the
price of a couple of grams.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.641
Who knows the difference
between mugging and murder.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.677
When Marie
was mugged,

15:12.679 --> 15:14.579
you know, on the
East Side last year?

15:14.581 --> 15:16.547
What was the first
thing that I did?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.549
Picked up your gun
and went looking.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.651
Think.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.152
You've been mugged.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.687
You wallet's gone.
After you call the cops,

15:22.689 --> 15:25.390
the first thing you do is what?

15:27.394 --> 15:29.460
Willie shoots the Ralstons,

15:29.462 --> 15:32.597
cleans out her purse,
takes his wallet...

15:32.599 --> 15:34.399
Sells the credit cards.

15:34.401 --> 15:38.536
It's been three days,
but not word one from the banks.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.406
Nobody's used the Ralston cards.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.410
Didn't even try.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.653
...An ad
in the<i> Times</i> Sunday magazine.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.389
A ten-room house, good schools.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.476
Alan always said

16:01.477 --> 16:04.562
we weren't the kind of people
who lived in the suburbs.

16:05.632 --> 16:09.167
What kind of people
live in the suburbs?

16:10.704 --> 16:14.973
The kind
that are still alive.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.676
The night it happened...

16:22.048 --> 16:27.585
Alan was coming around
the front of the car

16:27.587 --> 16:29.187
to open my door...

16:29.189 --> 16:31.689
I got out of the car.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.058
I gave him a kiss.

16:34.060 --> 16:38.596
I noticed there were
some flowers in the back seat.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.265
I asked him to get the flowers.

16:41.267 --> 16:44.469
He opened the door.

16:44.471 --> 16:51.142
Um... he was... he was looking
for something in his pocket.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.544
He.... he said,
"Did you lock it?"

16:53.546 --> 16:55.546
I turned to look.

16:55.548 --> 16:59.183
He went towards
the stairwell.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.119
A man came out.

17:01.121 --> 17:04.622
He was black.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.491
I didn't see a gun.

17:06.493 --> 17:10.194
I heard the shot,
and I saw Alan's face.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.231
He looked like
he'd been punched.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.603
Yeah, it's amazing.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.172
She repeated her
story perfectly.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.475
Yeah. Word for word.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.612
You know, I took the kids
to Duchess Stables last weekend.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.615
I hate horseback riding--
scares the hell out of me.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.184
Scary for
the horse, too.

17:33.186 --> 17:37.822
You know... I last on the saddle
maybe two, three minutes.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.124
I get off,
I can't remember one second.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.593
Her husband gets shot,
she gets shot.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.262
She sees a black guy,
gets scared

17:44.264 --> 17:45.296
she remembers every second.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.598
I know cops been
in shooting cases,

17:47.600 --> 17:50.768
lucky if they can remember
their badge number.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.609
TIVNAN:
I didn't take no ring.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.577
LOGAN:
And the wallet?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.112
I didn't take no wallet.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.646
Come on.
Where did you unload
the credit cards?

18:02.649 --> 18:05.616
Look, the light went off
and I ran.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.717
Light?

18:06.719 --> 18:08.086
Yeah, in the stairs.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.088
That's why
I couldn't find my stem.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.691
Okay, Willie,
one more time,
real slow.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.093
You light up
a rock...

18:15.095 --> 18:16.727
The lights went off
in the stairwell

18:16.729 --> 18:20.231
and then, you know,
bang, bang-- shots.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.700
I ran.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.370
Willie, you may just
have bought yourself

18:26.372 --> 18:28.573
a ticket out of here.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.256
The light went out, huh?

18:45.258 --> 18:47.625
Where's the switch?

18:47.627 --> 18:50.595
I think Willie's
jerking us around.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.763
See if it screws in.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.136
Whoa! Whoops. Sorry.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.837
That's my foot.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.645
How many killers
does it take to...

19:07.647 --> 19:09.847
Take the bulb, huh?

19:16.656 --> 19:19.323
Thanks.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.225
Nothing on Janet.

19:22.395 --> 19:26.931
Mr. Himes--
the Ralston's financial advisor?

19:26.933 --> 19:29.200
Public lewdness.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.702
He a kink?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.738
Last January.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.773
He's coming down the sawmill,
11:00 at night,

19:35.775 --> 19:37.675
stops at the toll booth.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.726
He's half naked.

19:38.727 --> 19:39.776
Some woman's her head
in his lap.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.679
(<i> chuckles</i> )

19:41.681 --> 19:43.247
She was probably napping.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.682
He's in
the automatic lane.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.467
Tosses the token.

19:46.468 --> 19:48.251
Guy in the next booth
looks over, sees him.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.754
He calls the cops.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.459
P.O.'d because they didn't
drive through his booth.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.395
State Trooper stops them.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.330
Issues a warning,
but makes out a report.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.265
Janet Ralston.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.700
Brenda Smith.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.669
Cop describes Brenda.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.705
Brenda sounds a lot like Janet.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.408
Guess what.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.809
I can hardly wait.

20:11.811 --> 20:12.944
The car.

20:12.946 --> 20:14.345
The Ralstons'.

20:14.347 --> 20:19.483
That big, shiny,
1989 Lincoln town car.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.755
CRAGEN:
<i> Reopen the case?</i>

20:24.757 --> 20:25.790
I love this.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.658
I really love this.

20:27.660 --> 20:31.462
Just before Willie ran,
he said the lights went out.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.414
In his brain.

20:33.415 --> 20:35.365
The bulb-- we got there today--
it was still unscrewed.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.534
So?

20:36.535 --> 20:37.701
Willie got a reason
to lie about this?

20:37.704 --> 20:38.936
So?

20:38.938 --> 20:40.905
LOGAN:
Look, there were
two sets of prints

20:40.907 --> 20:41.939
on that bulb.

20:41.941 --> 20:45.276
One of them, Gil Himes.

20:45.278 --> 20:48.679
Janet Ralston was shot twice.

20:48.681 --> 20:52.483
So you're telling me
that Gil Himes shot her husband,

20:52.485 --> 20:55.753
then shot her twice,
and now she's covering for him?

20:59.959 --> 21:01.959
She's out of the hospital.

21:01.961 --> 21:05.796
I want to put everything on hold
and just stick to her.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.832
On a hunch?

21:07.834 --> 21:10.434
On a hunch that Gil Himes
doesn't change light bulbs

21:10.436 --> 21:11.702
on his day off.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.271
It's not even
Himes's garage.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.805
There's no
possible explanation

21:14.807 --> 21:17.441
for his prints
being on that bulb.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.413
Anybody finds out
we break this case

21:22.415 --> 21:24.815
and then want
to unbreak it...

21:24.817 --> 21:27.885
somebody wanted
that hallway dark.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.823
Three days.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.426
tell anybody.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.295
You're going
to be happy

21:37.297 --> 21:38.829
you did this,
captain.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.765
No, I'm not.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.945
Weather report?

21:54.947 --> 21:57.848
Cloudy... no rain.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.551
Last 24 hours, she's been
to the butcher,

22:00.553 --> 22:02.853
the florist, the greengrocer...

22:02.855 --> 22:04.555
dry cleaners,
beauty parlor

22:04.557 --> 22:06.857
and she took the kids
to school.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.959
Leads a rich and full life,
this lady.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.328
Male visitors?

22:10.330 --> 22:11.595
No visitors, period.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.998
A regular nun.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.334
Detective Vitello
should know.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.468
He worships me.

22:17.470 --> 22:20.004
He thinks I might
raise the dead.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.473
You do this routine

"Widow, two kids,
victim of a horrible crime

22:34.987 --> 22:35.986

Maybe it will buy me

Hamstead Hotel.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.199
Mr. Himes

23:55.201 --> 23:57.568

He got home late.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.575
LOGAN:
You know what I think?

24:04.577 --> 24:09.447
I think you and Mr. Himes
are having an affair.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.615
I think your boyfriend
shot your husband.

24:11.617 --> 24:14.485
I think the D.A.
Is going to charge you

24:14.487 --> 24:17.621
as an accessory
to the crime.

24:17.623 --> 24:21.559
I think you're too smart
not to cooperate.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.668
Oh, God.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.506
I was having an affair...

24:36.742 --> 24:39.543
but I broke it off.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.581
Something must have happened

24:43.583 --> 24:46.584
because he got really enraged
and...

24:46.586 --> 24:48.118
he snapped and...

he came after Alan and I

25:19.285 --> 25:20.985
does that mean
you want a hearing?

25:20.987 --> 25:22.820
No, no, Your Honor.

25:22.822 --> 25:25.923
Then let's have the defendant
enter a plea.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.592
JUDGE:
Mr. Himes?

25:28.594 --> 25:30.261
Not guilty.

25:30.263 --> 25:32.997
Your Honor, Mr. Himes is
a substantial member

25:32.999 --> 25:34.732
of the community
and has no criminal record.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.567
We ask that he be
released on...

25:36.569 --> 25:39.236
If you're suggesting
"own recognizance"

25:39.238 --> 25:40.971
the answer is no.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.673
This is two felonies,

25:42.675 --> 25:44.942
one of them
a homicide.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.044
Mr. Stone?

25:47.046 --> 25:50.814
We'd like to guarantee
Mr. Himes appears, Your Honor.

25:50.816 --> 25:54.051
Bail is set at $200,000,

25:54.053 --> 25:56.854
cash or bond.

25:56.856 --> 26:01.325
Murder in
the second degree, Stone?

26:01.327 --> 26:04.728
You have to show the public
you go after the rich?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.830
Your client
killed in cold blood.

26:06.832 --> 26:09.867
I don't care if he's homeless
or owns Grand Central Station.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.936
You get murder two
from the grand jury,
it's abusive.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.572
Under extreme
emotional disturbance,

26:14.574 --> 26:15.573
you're lucky if you get
manslaughter two.

26:15.575 --> 26:16.907
The emotionally disturbed

26:16.909 --> 26:18.342
do not plan as well
as Himes did.

26:18.344 --> 26:23.581
It's a crime of passion,
Stone, pure and simple.

26:23.583 --> 26:28.986
A crime of passion is never pure
and it's certainly not simple.

26:28.988 --> 26:34.592
Gil was like the guys
I dated in college.

26:34.594 --> 26:37.027
The ones
you didn't marry?

26:37.029 --> 26:39.063
The ones you met

26:39.065 --> 26:42.866
after your respectable dates
dropped you off.

26:42.868 --> 26:46.003
How long had this
been going on?

26:46.005 --> 26:48.872
Do we have to go into this?

26:48.874 --> 26:50.608
Mrs. Ralston,

26:50.610 --> 26:54.044
you're going to be a witness
against Mr. Himes.

26:55.881 --> 26:57.948
Three months.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.619
I loved Alan.

27:01.621 --> 27:05.623
I didn't want
to throw that away.

27:05.625 --> 27:09.994
How did Mr. Himes react
when you told him that?

27:09.996 --> 27:13.030
Well, he said
he understood.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.899
Why did you lie to the police?

27:15.901 --> 27:19.069
He tried to kill me.

27:20.906 --> 27:22.906
I was afraid.

27:22.908 --> 27:25.976
He was crazy, irrational.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.780
He looked at me

27:29.782 --> 27:32.850
like he didn't even know
who I was.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.988
He was...

27:37.990 --> 27:42.059
a completely changed person.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.439
The Ralstons?

27:55.441 --> 27:58.442
The night of our party,
they were getting along fine.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.943
Until he wanted to leave.

27:59.945 --> 28:00.944
Dorothy.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.380
12:00, He wants to go home.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.416
Janet says she's having
too good a time.

28:05.418 --> 28:08.018
Dorothy...
2:30, The queen
wants to leave.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.120
Alan's got
a second wind.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.756
She dragged him out
like she had a plane to catch.

28:12.758 --> 28:13.891
You never
liked her.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.793
That's because she's a bitch,
darling.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.195
but I always liked him.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.699
The evening ran
on Janet's schedule.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.467
He wants to go; she says no.
She wants to go; they leave.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.102
CRAGEN:
He had an appointment.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.071
Run a gun check
on Himes and Janet.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.939
Registration,
out-of-state sales.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.474
It's still thin.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.009
Make it strong
and make it fit.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.011
I want a conviction
on this.
On who?

28:34.013 --> 28:36.146
The only one on trial here
is Himes,

28:36.148 --> 28:38.015
but I'd love to get her, too.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.250
A little bloodlust, Adam?

28:40.252 --> 28:43.087
You ever look at a calendar?

28:43.089 --> 28:46.190
Oh, next year
is an election year.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.727
If it's easy to buy a gun,

28:49.729 --> 28:52.029
That means they don't
a lot of paperwork.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.031
State requires
a lot of paperwork,

28:54.033 --> 28:55.933
then it's not so easy
to buy a gun.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.736
We need a place no waiting time,

28:58.738 --> 29:01.138
but where they still keep
accurate records.

29:01.140 --> 29:05.109
That leaves Kentucky,
Delaware, Tennessee,

29:05.111 --> 29:08.011
Virginia, North Carolina.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.747
That's it?

29:09.749 --> 29:12.082
We strike out with those,
we're in trouble.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.085
Maybe we can get
Himes's credit card stubs,

29:15.087 --> 29:18.088
her credit card stubs going back
a year, year-and-a-half.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.190
Business trips, vacations--

29:20.192 --> 29:22.025
did they hit
any of those states?

29:22.027 --> 29:25.996
The guy offered
a $50,000 reward.

29:25.998 --> 29:29.800
Crime of passion.

29:29.802 --> 29:33.137
Short of a mob killing,
I'm beginning to think

29:33.139 --> 29:35.139
this is the most
dispassionate murder

29:35.141 --> 29:37.007
I've ever seen.

29:37.009 --> 29:40.978
That hump Himes,
acting like their Dutch Uncle.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.881
Helping the Ralstons
look for a new house

29:43.883 --> 29:47.551
checking out the schools
in the suburbs for the kids,

29:47.553 --> 29:50.888
clearing the decks
for their new baby.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.123
One hell of a financial advisor.

29:53.125 --> 29:56.560
What about their finances?

29:56.562 --> 30:01.265
Had this woman, right?
Smart-looking broad.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.901
She come in here
five, six, seven times a day,

30:03.903 --> 30:06.003
each time with a different guy.

30:06.005 --> 30:09.173
Turns out she's using the booth
over there to turn tricks.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.542
And when we caught her, she said

30:11.544 --> 30:15.112
"Hey, it's a hell of a lot
cheaper than a hotel."

30:15.114 --> 30:17.447
Find what you're looking for?

30:21.887 --> 30:24.555
There are standards

30:24.557 --> 30:26.957
but it's up to the individual
insurance agent.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.826
Just tell me
about the standards.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.093
Before the new policy
was issued,

30:30.095 --> 30:32.863
the Ralstons already
had $2 million

30:32.865 --> 30:35.365
in life insurance, all on him.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.100
$2 million?

30:37.102 --> 30:40.003
Most couples, now, they
also insure the wife.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.372
Her role costs money
to replace-- child care,

30:42.374 --> 30:44.107
housekeeping...
Not the Ralstons.

30:44.109 --> 30:46.109
What about
the new policy?

30:46.111 --> 30:48.145
An additional $3 million?

30:48.147 --> 30:51.315
Well, let's say that's
borderline excessive.

30:51.317 --> 30:54.117
So, the agent shouldn't
have written it?

30:54.119 --> 30:56.086
The agent should have wondered
what was going on.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.955
On top of the personal,

30:57.957 --> 31:00.324
$4 million more paid for
by the business.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.226
Is that unusual?

31:02.228 --> 31:05.229
Not if the partners
are collecting.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.998
Alan Ralston's beneficiary?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.366
His wife.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.635
This wasn't life insurance.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.337
It was the lottery.

31:13.339 --> 31:16.373
Mrs. Ralston hits
the right number.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.076
She collects
$9 million.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.015
What does it
look like to you?

31:25.017 --> 31:26.884
Like to me like
Himes is interested

31:26.886 --> 31:28.886
in seeing Ralston
overinsured.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.121
After Janet broke his heart,
cut off the affair?

31:31.123 --> 31:33.023
That guy is
a positive humanitarian.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.292
Candidate for best
friend of the year.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.928
What if she didn't break off
the affair?

31:37.930 --> 31:39.096
No, got nothing on the girl.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.297
The gun?

31:40.299 --> 31:43.033
We got word
from Kentucky, Tennessee,

31:43.035 --> 31:46.069
Delaware and North Carolina.
No luck.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.939
And that leaves...?
We'd better get lucky
with Virginia.

31:48.941 --> 31:52.309
A year ago, right after
Janet was mugged.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.044
Richmond, Virginia.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.947
Tracy's
Field and Sport Shop.

31:56.949 --> 31:59.082
A sporting gun?

31:59.084 --> 32:01.585
If you're hunting people.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.087
Beretta, model 94,
blowback semi-automatic
nine millimeter.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.189
Sold to Himes, Gilbert?

32:06.191 --> 32:10.060
And not to Ralston, Janet,
either.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.662
Ralston, Alan?

32:11.664 --> 32:14.364
ROBINETTE:
And they stick
to their stories

32:14.366 --> 32:17.067
the worst we get him for
is maybe man two.

32:17.069 --> 32:19.069
She still gets a walk.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.203
She's already set up

32:20.205 --> 32:23.040
a diminished capacity defense
for him.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.376
Said he looked crazy.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.246
You used Alan's gun,
didn't you, Mr. Himes?

32:29.248 --> 32:32.115
I love Janet Ralston.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.350
SHELL:
<i> You want to talk a deal?</i>

32:33.352 --> 32:35.352
I want to talk guns.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.653
How did you get the Beretta?

32:36.655 --> 32:37.988
Did she give it to you
before the party?

32:37.990 --> 32:39.356
No more questions, Stone,

32:39.358 --> 32:42.225
till you put a proposal
on the table.

32:42.227 --> 32:45.996
He rolls on Mrs. Ralston,
comes up with some evidence--
manslaughter one.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.165
That's not a proposal.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.100
It's an insult.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.169
Come on, Gil.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.379
Himes really does
love her.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.115
Maybe he loves
manslaughter two more.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.984
We don't find out
how it went down,

33:06.986 --> 33:08.218
we may have to
offer it to him..

33:08.220 --> 33:12.055
Well, then let's find out
how it went down.

33:15.394 --> 33:17.027
GREEVEY:
Let's start over, Willie.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.262
How many times
I got to tell you?

33:19.264 --> 33:22.165
GREEVEY:
The lights go out. Then what?

33:22.167 --> 33:24.768
Look, I hear a scream,
then a shot.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.269
Righ after the
lights went out?

33:26.271 --> 33:27.471
Same time.

33:27.473 --> 33:30.340
Run that past me again.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.509
The lights went off.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.011
I hear a shot.

33:34.013 --> 33:37.014
The door opens,
a couple seconds later,

33:37.016 --> 33:40.150
I hear two more shots,
I get the hell out of there.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.085
If the light was off,

33:42.087 --> 33:44.021
how do you know the door opened?

33:44.023 --> 33:46.723
Light came in from the garage.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.158
After the first shot.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.261
Am I talking too fast?
That's what I said.

33:51.263 --> 33:54.264
You know,lights off,
then bang.

33:54.266 --> 33:57.100
Door opens. Bang, bang.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.470
Willie fires up
a rock.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.372
The light goes out.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.809
The first shot came
before the door opened?

34:05.811 --> 34:09.312
Then the door opens,
then there's two more shots.

34:09.314 --> 34:13.250
But if it's Himes coming down
the stairs, and it is,

34:13.252 --> 34:14.351
he goes to the light...

34:14.353 --> 34:16.253
He unscrews it...

34:16.255 --> 34:18.155
the door yet.
He hasn't opened

34:18.157 --> 34:19.523
A gun goes off.

34:19.525 --> 34:22.125
So, who shot Alan Ralston?

34:22.127 --> 34:25.395
GREEVEY:
Is Willie
a good enough witness?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.397
Good enough for me.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.199
Pick her up.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.838
Janet Ralston?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.406
You're under arrest

34:36.408 --> 34:38.408
for the murder
of Alan Ralston.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.844
You have the right
to remain silent

34:40.846 --> 34:42.546
and refuse
to answer questions.

34:42.548 --> 34:45.215
Anything you do say
may be used against
you in a court of law.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.419
STONE:
So you're saying
the first shot came

34:49.421 --> 34:51.321
before the door opened.

34:51.323 --> 34:54.124
TIVNAN:
Lights out. Bang.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.226
Then the door opens.

34:56.228 --> 34:59.196
But after the lights went out,
couple of seconds later,

34:59.198 --> 35:01.131
another two shots.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.833
Bang, bang.

35:02.835 --> 35:04.134
Thank you.

35:04.136 --> 35:06.870
No further questions,
Your Honor.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.772
Mr. Tivnan,

35:08.774 --> 35:13.243
what were you doing
on the stairs of the garage?

35:17.182 --> 35:19.883
Smoking crack.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.318
Uh-huh.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.752
Your habit?

35:22.754 --> 35:24.488
How much does it cost?

35:27.159 --> 35:29.292
$200 a day.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.194
Oh.

35:31.196 --> 35:34.264
Do you have a job, Mr. Tivnan?

35:34.266 --> 35:36.033
Objection, Your Honor.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.801
His employment has nothing
to do with his testimony.

35:37.803 --> 35:41.171
Mr. Tivnan's state of mind
is at issue here.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.272
Overruled.

35:42.274 --> 35:44.207
The witness will answer.

35:46.211 --> 35:50.547
I sell books, magazines
on the streets.

35:50.549 --> 35:54.417
Does that pay
for your crack habit?

35:54.419 --> 35:57.521
People do a lot of reading.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.457
(<i> laughter</i> )

36:00.459 --> 36:02.559
Thank you, Mr. Tivnan.

36:02.561 --> 36:06.429
In your autopsy,
you examined the entrance wound

36:06.431 --> 36:08.165
on Mr. Ralston's body?

36:08.167 --> 36:09.166
Yes, I did.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.300
What were your findings?

36:10.302 --> 36:13.837
Light powder burns
on Mr. Ralston's tux

36:13.839 --> 36:16.540
indicated that the gun had fired

36:16.542 --> 36:19.242
at a distance
of approximately three feet.

36:19.244 --> 36:22.479
The bullet entered Mr. Ralston
at the bottom of the thorax.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.214
It traveled upward.

36:24.216 --> 36:28.451
It pierced his right lung
and then entered his heart.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.787
From that description,
Mr. Borak,

36:30.789 --> 36:34.491
can you tell the height
of the person who fired the gun?

36:34.493 --> 36:35.859
Yes, I could.

36:35.861 --> 36:39.196
From the, uh, the angle
of the bullet's entry,

36:39.198 --> 36:41.198
the person who shot him

36:41.200 --> 36:44.935
would have to be no taller
than five foot six.

36:44.937 --> 36:47.871
In other words, someone shorter
than Mr. Ralston.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.373
BORAK:
Yes, that's right.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.808
Nothing further, Your Honor.

36:54.980 --> 36:59.316
If I told you the floor
of that garage slopes,

36:59.318 --> 37:01.851
would that affect
your estimation

37:01.853 --> 37:03.553
of the height
of the gunman you described?

37:03.555 --> 37:04.788
Oh, yes, yes,
it would.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.290
Good. It slopes.

37:07.292 --> 37:10.427
So it's possible that
Mr. Ralston was shot
by a six-foot man

37:10.429 --> 37:11.795
standing at the bottom
of a sloping floor.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.597
Yes, that is possible...

37:13.599 --> 37:15.232
Thank you.

37:15.234 --> 37:18.235
Nothing further, Your Honor.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.237
Mrs. Stark,
this was some months ago.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.239
Do you remember the Ralstons?

37:22.241 --> 37:24.975
Yes. They were a nice-looking
couple on vacation.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.910
Just come from the mountains.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.346
Did Mr. Ralston know
what kind of gun

37:29.348 --> 37:31.298
he wanted to buy?

37:31.299 --> 37:33.249
Well, he didn't know anything
about guns,

37:33.252 --> 37:36.253
so I showed him
some nice personal weapons.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.255
And he picked one out?

37:38.257 --> 37:40.590
she kept telling him
Well, the missus,

37:40.592 --> 37:42.993
that they had to have it,

37:42.994 --> 37:45.395
and he told her he did not want
the gun in the house,

37:45.397 --> 37:47.931
that one of the kids
might get his head blown off.

37:47.933 --> 37:51.935
And she kept reminding him
that she had been mugged

37:51.937 --> 37:53.403
on the street.

37:53.405 --> 37:57.274
So, Mr. Ralston
didn't want to buy a gun.

37:57.276 --> 38:01.044
No, it was Mrs. Ralston
who was all steamed up.

38:01.046 --> 38:04.514
She insisted that
he buy the Beretta.

38:07.286 --> 38:08.551
Thank you.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.020
No further questions.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.891
It's your meeting.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.293
Himes battered

38:16.295 --> 38:17.994
Mrs. Ralston
emotionally,

38:17.996 --> 38:19.496
but she never believed him
when he said

38:19.498 --> 38:20.930
he'd kill her and her husband.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.999
After he shot you,
Mrs. Ralston,

38:23.001 --> 38:25.001
you didn't go to the police.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.436
I told you.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.971
I was frightened.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.006
The only thing
Mrs. Ralston

38:30.008 --> 38:31.992
might have done wrong

38:31.993 --> 38:33.977
was to mention where Mr. Ralston
kept his gun.

38:33.979 --> 38:37.947
Nevertheless,
we will plead

38:37.949 --> 38:40.984
criminal facilitation four,
conspiracy five,

38:40.986 --> 38:43.586
and she'll testify
against Mr. Himes.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.055
You've got to be kidding.

38:45.057 --> 38:46.990
It's like he's on trial
for murder.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.092
You're offering us
two misdemeanors?

38:49.094 --> 38:51.561
I don't joke
about plea bargains, Mr. Stone.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.963
If you want to think
about manslaughter one,

38:53.965 --> 38:55.999
we might have something
to talk about.

38:56.001 --> 38:59.569
Well, I guess we have nothing
to talk about.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.743
They're not biting.
She doesn't think
we can convince a jury.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.478
Then plea it out
at man two.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.746
Slap on the wrist?

39:09.748 --> 39:11.381
Since when's two acquittals
better than one?

39:11.383 --> 39:13.083
Take one more run
at them.

39:13.085 --> 39:14.517
Don't blow this.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.520
I'll take man two.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.089
STONE:
Mr. Himes,

39:19.091 --> 39:21.057
she's getting ready
to burn you.

39:21.059 --> 39:24.361
That testimony about
how tall the gunman was?

39:24.363 --> 39:26.363
Your lover's lawyer
is trying

39:26.365 --> 39:29.399
to make it look like
you pulled the trigger.

39:29.401 --> 39:32.469
Janet's lawyer
was trying to prove

39:32.471 --> 39:34.471
neither of us did it.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.073
Listen to this.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.376
This is a transcript

39:39.378 --> 39:40.977
from one of the interviews
with Mrs. Ralston

39:40.979 --> 39:42.045
after you were arrested.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.780
"I loved Gil Himes,

39:43.782 --> 39:46.950
"but he turned out
to be weak and pathetic.

39:46.952 --> 39:50.053
"The only solution he found
to his unhappiness

39:50.055 --> 39:51.721
was to get a gun."

39:51.723 --> 39:54.090
That's how she depicts you.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.093
You're playing a bad hand,
Mr. Himes,

39:57.095 --> 39:59.129
and the dealer's crooked.

40:06.004 --> 40:12.075
Suppose the murder weapon
should... happen to turn up.

40:20.152 --> 40:25.989
Mr. Himes, you are now skirting
obstruction of justice.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.090
Don't push it, Stone.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.658
He said "suppose,"

40:28.660 --> 40:30.593
and he's on trial for murder.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.129
Suppose we add obstruction.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.732
Suppose you never get the gun.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.443
Manslaughter one.

40:46.445 --> 40:48.111
You'll lose.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.047
That jury will never convict.

40:59.524 --> 41:01.524
(<i> sarcastically</i> ):
True love.

41:01.526 --> 41:05.128
They'd sell each other
for a nickel.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.164
Give victor Norris a call.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.767
You said you have something
we want to hear?

41:10.769 --> 41:14.204
A rumor Mr. Himes
is thinking of producing

41:14.206 --> 41:16.105
a murder weapon.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.478
Auction block.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.745
Going, going...

41:22.747 --> 41:24.080
Two misdemeanors

41:24.082 --> 41:25.882
and she'll take
a year in jail.

41:25.884 --> 41:26.883
Manslaughter one.

41:26.885 --> 41:28.751
Going, going...

41:28.753 --> 41:30.119
No way.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.654
Gone.

41:31.656 --> 41:35.558
You don't scare me, Mr. Stone.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.894
Oh, yes, I do, Mrs. Ralston.

41:37.896 --> 41:40.497
I scare you a great deal.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.131
And I should.

41:44.202 --> 41:48.505
There's another offer
on the table from Mrs. Ralston.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.173
This is an idiotic game.

41:50.175 --> 41:53.676
She's up from
two misdemeanors
to jail time.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.517
We'll take manslaughter two.

42:00.519 --> 42:02.185
Oh, you'll have to do better
than that.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.521
Manslaughter one
he produces the weapon,

42:04.523 --> 42:07.123
and he tells the jury
how he planned it.

42:12.163 --> 42:16.165
Whoever gets to my door first.

42:22.674 --> 42:24.874
You know why
we're here.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.243
You can't do this, Stone.

42:34.920 --> 42:38.221
Last chance,
ladies and gentlemen.

42:40.659 --> 42:42.725
You've got nothing.

42:46.164 --> 42:48.231
Manslaughter one.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.599
Sold.

42:49.601 --> 42:52.569
You damn fool!

42:52.571 --> 42:55.738
We would have been acquitted.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.974
They've got nothing.

42:57.976 --> 43:01.711
God, you are a pathetic, limp...

43:01.713 --> 43:03.246
Oh, God!

43:04.849 --> 43:07.216
You are such a gutless...

43:16.995 --> 43:18.928
HIMES:
She came to me with the plan.

43:18.930 --> 43:21.798
STONE:
And what did
Mrs. Ralston suggest?

43:21.800 --> 43:25.268
HIMES:
She would tell Alan
she had been mugged.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.837
Would force him
to buy a gun.

43:27.839 --> 43:32.308
Was there more to the plan?

43:32.310 --> 43:37.213
Yes.

43:37.215 --> 43:41.618
She told me I would have
to shoot her, too.

43:41.620 --> 43:45.688
I said, "What?!"

43:45.690 --> 43:50.927
She said I would shoot her

43:50.929 --> 43:54.364
after she shot him.

43:54.366 --> 43:58.901
STONE:
On the night
of the shootings,

43:58.903 --> 44:01.638
did the plan go awry?

44:01.640 --> 44:06.009
I was supposed to be there
before she shot Alan,

44:06.011 --> 44:09.979
but, uh, he saw the gun
in her hand,

44:09.981 --> 44:10.980
so she had to shoot him

44:10.982 --> 44:17.720
before he came
into the stairwell.

44:19.858 --> 44:23.026
Who shot Mrs. Ralston?

44:23.028 --> 44:25.928
I did.

44:29.000 --> 44:34.070
Is this gun,
marked "People's Exhibit 26"

44:34.072 --> 44:37.040
the one you used
the night of the shootings?

44:37.042 --> 44:39.776
Yes.

44:41.813 --> 44:43.346
Now, Mr. Himes,

44:43.348 --> 44:47.250
please tell the jury
what happened

44:47.252 --> 44:51.821
after Mrs. Ralston
talked to the police

44:51.823 --> 44:55.058
at the Hamstead Hotel.

44:55.060 --> 44:58.361
She called me-- Janet called me
from a pay phone.

44:58.363 --> 45:01.397
Told me I was going
to be arrested

45:01.399 --> 45:04.100
and I should
go along with it.

45:04.102 --> 45:07.737
I said she was going
to hang us both.

45:07.739 --> 45:10.339
STONE:
What were her
exact words?

45:20.952 --> 45:24.053
She said,
"You dumb son of a bitch.

45:24.055 --> 45:27.390
"You'll get manslaughter two.

45:27.392 --> 45:29.459
"Minimum sentence.

45:29.461 --> 45:31.461
"Out in a third.

45:31.463 --> 45:33.730
Less than two years."

45:43.875 --> 45:49.946
"We'll have each other,"
she said.

45:49.948 --> 45:52.515
"And the money."

45:59.057 --> 46:01.758
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

46:01.760 --> 46:03.159
We have, Your Honor.

46:03.161 --> 46:06.362
Will the defendant
please rise?

46:14.072 --> 46:17.039
On the first count
of the indictment,

46:17.041 --> 46:19.776
the charge of murder
in the second degree,

46:19.778 --> 46:21.043
how does the jury find?

46:21.045 --> 46:23.813
We find the defendant guilty.

46:23.815 --> 46:27.450
JUDGE:
On the second count
of the indictment,

46:27.452 --> 46:31.053
conspiracy in the first degree,
how does the jury find?

46:31.055 --> 46:33.990
We find the defendant guilty.

46:39.063 --> 46:42.365
Janet Ralston's planning
to sue her lawyer.

46:42.367 --> 46:43.966
She doesn't quit.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.501
Reach any
conclusions?

46:45.503 --> 46:48.104
I'm trying
to forget her.

46:48.106 --> 46:49.806
Two men
in love with her.

46:49.808 --> 46:52.141
Kills one, ready to
sell out the other.

46:52.143 --> 46:55.144
What is it?
Greed? Power? Evil.

46:55.146 --> 46:57.814
I thought
you didn't believe in evil.

46:57.816 --> 46:59.549
Never met Janet Ralston before.

46:59.551 --> 47:01.951
She's either evil
or she's two years old.

47:01.953 --> 47:04.487
She wants what she wants
when she wants it.

47:04.489 --> 47:04.520
That's cute.
