see you better?

17:54.417 --> 17:56.500
Okay.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.875
A little more to the left.

17:57.875 --> 17:59.458
And perfect.

18:01.959 --> 18:04.375
[whistles]

18:04.375 --> 18:05.333
The signal.

18:21.542 --> 18:22.917
[vomits]

18:22.917 --> 18:25.875
Oh, Kick, no.
No, no, no, no.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.959
That outfit isn’t you at all.

18:28.959 --> 18:30.917
Clashes with your skin tone.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.458
Stick to skateboarding,
my friend.

<i>[Announcer]</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

18:40.458 --> 18:42.417
<i>Miss Penelope Patterson.</i>

18:46.250 --> 18:48.834
"To be or not to be?

18:48.834 --> 18:51.250
That is the question."

18:51.250 --> 18:55.291
Reciting Shakespeare
while riding a unicycle
is so last year.

18:55.291 --> 18:58.125
"Whether ’tis nobler
in the mind to suffer."

18:58.125 --> 18:59.250
[cheering and applause]

18:59.250 --> 19:02.083
I don’t believe it.
They love it.

19:03.834 --> 19:04.834
Ha!

19:04.834 --> 19:06.417
No stickers,
no sparkles,

19:06.417 --> 19:09.083
no ribbons,
and no unicorns.

19:09.083 --> 19:12.458
Never out-dare
a daredevil, sis.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.250
Who cares about
some dumb old trike?

19:14.250 --> 19:15.792
Did you see Penelope?

19:15.792 --> 19:18.000
I’ll never be
Miss Pretty Pink Precious.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.417
Aw, come on.
She’s not that good.

19:20.417 --> 19:23.375
"Thus conscience does
make cowards of us all."

19:23.375 --> 19:26.000
Okay, she is that good.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.083
Crowd’s all yours, Brianna.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.083
[laughs]

19:29.083 --> 19:31.041
That’s it. I quit.

19:31.041 --> 19:34.625
Shh. You don’t quit
in front of the Trike X5.

19:34.625 --> 19:36.125
You don’t quit, period.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.959
Did you quit when you stole
my Trike X5?

19:39.959 --> 19:41.542
No.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.208
Did you quit when you covered it

19:43.208 --> 19:46.208
in a bunch
of frou-frouy garbage?

19:46.208 --> 19:47.667
No.
Did you quit

19:47.667 --> 19:49.417
when you led me on a chase
through town

19:49.417 --> 19:51.250
that caused me abrasions,
contusions,

19:51.250 --> 19:52.834
and a humiliating make-over?

19:52.834 --> 19:53.834
No!

19:53.834 --> 19:56.417
Then you’re not going
to quit now.

19:56.417 --> 20:01.792
You’ve got brains, talent,
and the Trike X5.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.792
<i>And now ladies and gentlemen,</i>

20:08.792 --> 20:11.583
Miss Brianna G. Buttowski.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.875
And her musical wheels
of doom.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.166
[audience gasps]

20:19.041 --> 20:20.875
I’m not sure
I can do this, Kick.

20:20.875 --> 20:22.583
You’re the stunt guy.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.667
You’ve got that iron grip.
Just hang on tight.

20:38.667 --> 20:39.709
That’s how you hook them, Bree.

20:41.917 --> 20:42.583
Ugh.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.792
Now, brakes in 3, 2--

20:54.208 --> 20:56.041
[cheering and applause]

20:56.041 --> 20:56.709
Yeah!

21:01.166 --> 21:03.166
Thanks, Kick, so much.

21:03.166 --> 21:06.625
You were right.
Trike X5 is the greatest.

21:06.625 --> 21:08.959
Yes, it is, and it’s yours.

21:08.959 --> 21:10.000
Really?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Really.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.500
Trike X5 victory lap. Whoo.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.875
Ride it bravely, Brianna.

21:14.875 --> 21:15.959
Ride it wisely.

21:15.959 --> 21:17.417
[crash]
Ouch!

21:17.417 --> 21:19.583
And watch out for walls.
