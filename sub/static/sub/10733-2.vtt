01:32.461 --> 01:34.880
There's a whole city of aliens down here.

01:34.881 --> 01:39.011
You sounds surprised, Ben "dude".
- A whole secret city?

01:39.012 --> 01:42.413
Comes partner, we must catch those
lowlifes, while break the Bowman's store.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.810
Yeah, Rook, about that
whole partner thing?

01:45.811 --> 01:47.548
Don't get your hopes up.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.644
XLR8 can catch those skill buckets. {*corr}

02:48.391 --> 02:51.109
NRG? Really?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.007
What happened?

02:56.161 --> 03:00.434
New Omnitrix.
I'm still learning the controls.

03:00.435 --> 03:01.735
Allow me.

03:12.533 --> 03:16.764
Nice doing, Rook ...
for a newbie... I mean.

03:17.974 --> 03:23.029
Now, talk! Who is behind
this alien shakedown?

03:25.020 --> 03:28.145
Behind you!
- Even I didn't fall for that.

03:28.146 --> 03:30.279
And this is my
first day on Earth.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.300
Rook, quick!

03:44.227 --> 03:49.087
Hey, you'll took out my brakes!
- When you ran us over!

<i>Next stop, Gashe's Garden.</i>

04:19.519 --> 04:23.632
Hey! You don't have brakes!
- It will come to him.

04:28.329 --> 04:32.391
I can't believe this place!
Come on, let's look around.

04:38.632 --> 04:40.760
Where are you, friend?

04:45.238 --> 04:47.286
There's a boy.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.779
Raise with this use. {*corr}

04:55.362 --> 04:56.932
Half-melted.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.233
Huntin' up.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.587
I know I'm the new guy, Ben dude.

05:19.588 --> 05:22.940
Dude!
Call me "Ben"!

05:22.941 --> 05:27.988
Ben, shouldn't we go
after those lowlifes?

05:29.068 --> 05:31.529
How long do you suppose
they's been in Undertown?

05:31.530 --> 05:34.352
Probably since Earth
became an open system.

05:34.538 --> 05:36.457
But, Ben ...
- I know,

05:36.458 --> 05:39.210
you're about to say something
official and Plumber-y.

05:39.211 --> 05:40.701
Yes, Ben ...

05:40.702 --> 05:44.404
Tentacles on the sticks,
so fresh, take grab. You...

05:46.269 --> 05:48.404
I'm finally that hungry.

05:48.405 --> 05:51.932
Give me one of those.
- With suckers or without?

05:51.933 --> 05:55.870
With ...  - Excuse me,
we're Plumbers working at case.

05:55.871 --> 05:59.572
Did you see a group of bipedal
lowlifes run thru here? One psionic?

05:59.573 --> 06:02.534
What? No, I don't know nothing,
I didn't seen them.

06:03.803 --> 06:05.667
Hey!
What about tentacle?

06:05.668 --> 06:08.927
Never heard of it.
- Dude, you're gonna sell me...

06:08.928 --> 06:12.662
I don't sell nothing.
I'm not even here, red spot Plumber.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.056
Oh man, why you've
had to show your badge?

06:18.676 --> 06:23.252
I was interrogating a witness.
But I may have misjudged.

06:23.763 --> 06:26.828
Don't stress,
I am the one who skipped breakfast.

06:27.111 --> 06:29.497
This is my first time
I'm away from home.

06:29.498 --> 06:31.102
When I first became a Plumber

06:31.103 --> 06:33.435
a was a scientist at my
home planet, Revonnah.

06:33.436 --> 06:37.088
The most exciting thing to do there
is keep rodents out of the green silos.

06:37.089 --> 06:40.169
You learned to fight like that
protecting alien weed?

06:40.364 --> 06:43.929
On Revonnah
the rodents run fairly large.

06:52.341 --> 06:55.794
I really do think we should
continue looking for the lowlifes.

06:55.795 --> 06:59.137
Relax. Pretty soon
the big bad will say...

06:59.138 --> 07:01.688
Ben Tennyson, here ruining my plan!

07:01.689 --> 07:04.496
And then your lowlifes will come
looking for us.

07:07.187 --> 07:08.487
Rook?

07:08.772 --> 07:11.841
Excuse me, we are
Plumbers working at case,

07:11.842 --> 07:13.888
can I ask you some questions?

07:19.182 --> 07:23.160
Knock yourself out.
I gotta find something to eat.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.984
"Tube sizes" group in pairs, three or five.

07:37.985 --> 07:40.523
Guarantee to fix any tube.

07:44.536 --> 07:46.955
Mommy, I got a "Bloody nose".

07:48.704 --> 07:51.280
Well, did you expect
me to cook it over here?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.752
Ok ... if that's makin' me hungry ...

07:55.753 --> 07:57.796
<i>Get your proteins in Smoothy's.</i>

07:57.797 --> 07:59.097
"Smoothy's"?

08:00.116 --> 08:02.423
Get your proteins in Smoothy's.

08:09.737 --> 08:11.175
There you are, sir.

08:12.462 --> 08:15.343
Is that safe to eat?
Well, for me, I mean.

08:15.735 --> 08:17.910
Hey, listen ape...

08:28.153 --> 08:29.938
What the heck?

08:42.254 --> 08:44.319
Do I know you?

08:50.132 --> 08:53.667
You are not the only big
bruiser in undertown, ugly.

08:53.668 --> 08:55.496
It's hero time!

09:05.796 --> 09:11.222
Oh, Water Hazard ...
Why can I ever get a Humongousaur?

09:18.148 --> 09:19.682
Get off me!

09:23.404 --> 09:25.067
Allow me, too.

09:26.510 --> 09:27.898
<i>I've got this.</i>

09:36.844 --> 09:38.617
Uhh...
I got this.

09:43.729 --> 09:45.651
Why're you just standing there?

09:45.652 --> 09:48.805
"You got this", I wouldn't want to interfere.

09:48.806 --> 09:51.907
No, it's cool. Interfere!

09:55.292 --> 09:56.592
Hold still.

10:05.958 --> 10:07.453
Nice shot.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.764
Oh, man!

10:27.000 --> 10:32.439
Two against one.
Well, they odd to became a bit unsporty.

10:43.023 --> 10:46.568
Who ever sent that monster to kill me?
He's the big bad.

10:46.569 --> 10:48.589
See how this works?
Come on.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.514
Oh, which way did it go?
- Not to worry, Ben.

10:52.515 --> 10:55.829
While you were looking for food,
my investigation turned up a lead.

10:55.830 --> 10:57.760
Of course it did.

11:01.838 --> 11:04.498
<i>Don't tell me, the baloon squealed.</i>

11:04.499 --> 11:08.640
I was told that this is where the psionic
biped can be found in this time a day.

11:08.641 --> 11:11.441
Bubble Helmet? In here?

11:14.503 --> 11:16.914
<i>Use the service entrance.</i>

11:19.303 --> 11:23.400
Hope you're ok with waiting outside,
that's poison gas in there.

11:23.401 --> 11:24.701
Ready?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.495
All bandages in the air! {*corr}

11:37.000 --> 11:40.967
Will you call it with the badge?
We're not cops.

11:50.300 --> 11:54.797
Well, you might be a cop,
I'm a superhero.

11:55.059 --> 11:56.450
There he is!

12:01.437 --> 12:05.241
Nice hangout.
Great atmosphere.

12:06.357 --> 12:09.397
So, who is behind those shakedowns?

12:10.810 --> 12:14.857
I'll tell you...
as soon I can breathe.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.328
That's a fair bargain.
- Rook, no!

12:34.761 --> 12:37.972
You've never dealt with actual
bad guy before, have you?

12:37.973 --> 12:41.568
I've read about them in books
and trained it intensively.

12:42.179 --> 12:46.338
Don't loose him this time.
He rodent will lead us to the nest.

13:02.140 --> 13:05.562
You will take these shakedown
machines to the surface.

13:05.705 --> 13:09.266
And faint out into the entire city. {*corr}

13:09.267 --> 13:13.427
But, boss, only the alien's stores
have to take might tu pay us in.

13:17.860 --> 13:22.722
Gold fear is my currency!

13:22.723 --> 13:26.297
All money is just to
wait to keep the score...

13:26.462 --> 13:28.695
my reputation will be made.

13:28.696 --> 13:32.625
Once the whole city fears
the name ...

13:32.626 --> 13:37.210
<i>Ben 10!
They're after me, boss.</i>

13:49.923 --> 13:52.679
We had a deal.
- Rook, hands up!

13:56.670 --> 13:59.150
Oh.
- Nice.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.830
Look, a boat of those
shakedown machines.

14:07.831 --> 14:09.999
That spells a boat lot of shakedown.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.186
That is quite a lot?
- Oh, yeah.

14:12.308 --> 14:15.290
Enough to take out the city.
- Ben Tennyson.

14:18.200 --> 14:23.549
Here to ruin my plan?
I think not.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.200
Psyphon?

14:25.201 --> 14:29.158
It seems that my investigation
lead us right to your "big bad".

14:34.779 --> 14:36.125
Psyphon?

14:36.126 --> 14:39.615
You're the one who's been jackin'
the stores in Bellwood?

14:39.616 --> 14:43.533
You were always like Vilgax's
third toughest lackie!

14:43.534 --> 14:47.574
Big seems you have like...
underestimated me.

14:47.575 --> 14:49.201
Yeah? Who wouldn't?

14:49.202 --> 14:53.993
You lead Ben Tennyson right to me.

14:53.994 --> 14:58.359
I don't know how to thank you
or eviscerate you.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.608
Thank me?

15:06.226 --> 15:07.714
Thank you ...

15:07.715 --> 15:13.408
you must have wondered what
ever became of me, Ben Tennyson.

15:13.409 --> 15:14.943
Not even a little bit.

15:15.096 --> 15:20.924
Of course, you still
think of me as a servant.

15:21.074 --> 15:24.560
But now... I am Master!

15:24.561 --> 15:29.724
So you cannot imagine the joy
with which I say this...

15:30.589 --> 15:32.412
Get them, boys!

15:46.500 --> 15:49.048
Come on, work for once!

15:57.546 --> 15:59.524
Ben! Behind you!

16:07.800 --> 16:09.626
Break it up, people!

16:10.400 --> 16:13.934
Better yet, let me break it up for you.

16:24.153 --> 16:27.346
Forgive me, I have any witty remarks.

16:27.588 --> 16:31.882
Don't force it, Rook.
Let the wise crack come to you.

16:33.487 --> 16:36.265
Ugh.
Oh-oh.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.480
Did you think I'd be unprepared?

16:58.226 --> 17:01.445
What's happen' to me?!

17:09.171 --> 17:12.840
Separate them, Tennyson is my quarry.

17:14.420 --> 17:18.941
My exciter-beam has been
overloaded your nervous system.

17:19.200 --> 17:24.976
Someone is gonna get hurt!
- Only by you, hero.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.133
That unpleasant twitchy
feeling is only temporary.

17:39.134 --> 17:44.569
But I have so many
sensations left to show you.

17:58.009 --> 18:02.065
For Goodness' sake,
Psyphon, call your dog off!

18:05.933 --> 18:07.933
This is not mine!

18:25.662 --> 18:28.553
Shocksquatch?
Heh. Ok.

18:32.427 --> 18:35.312
Psyphon, this your last warning.

18:40.644 --> 18:42.023
Pest!

18:46.690 --> 18:49.635
I must have that armor!

19:16.389 --> 19:19.061
The body armor is not
for sale, Psyphon.

19:20.931 --> 19:27.832
Oh, I don't want to buy it,
I will prey it from your lifeless body.

19:28.179 --> 19:30.517
How great from you...

19:38.742 --> 19:41.841
Not so green that I lead
a tunnel collapse on me.

19:41.842 --> 19:44.342
I believe that was my first wise crack.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.005
No brakes.

20:00.629 --> 20:02.230
Still there?

20:04.128 --> 20:05.670
Here we go...

20:14.352 --> 20:17.274
Metal all around,
just gonna get him in the middle.

20:18.424 --> 20:20.662
Brake this!

20:31.676 --> 20:34.623
Ben ...
I made a wise crack.

20:46.616 --> 20:47.916
Gone.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.710
You did well, old friend.

21:08.518 --> 21:11.768
But this Ben Tennyson is
more powerfull that I imagined.

21:11.994 --> 21:16.342
And resourcefull.
He will be a greatest trophy.

21:16.624 --> 21:20.729
Khyber the Huntsman...
promises it.

21:25.922 --> 21:29.503
I'm telling you, I don't know
what that creature was!

21:29.504 --> 21:32.950
Well, tell it to the arbiter.
Transport's to topside.

21:33.252 --> 21:35.151
So, how'd you like your new partner?

21:35.286 --> 21:38.305
He fights ok.
Kind of a doughnut hole, though.

21:38.661 --> 21:42.893
Is that good?
- Oh, sure! See?

21:42.894 --> 21:45.303
Well Ben, you're been
doin' this a while, now,

21:45.304 --> 21:48.628
maybe it's somebody else's
turned to be the "doughnut hole".

21:48.916 --> 21:51.309
Huh?
- I know you haven't eaten yet,

21:51.581 --> 21:55.536
Magister Tennyson here says
you prefer these chilli fries.

21:55.854 --> 21:57.154
Care to join me?

21:59.072 --> 22:00.973
Partner!
