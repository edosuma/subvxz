00:35.910 --> 00:37.120
Why don't you just…

00:39.873 --> 00:41.166
turn yourself in, Presiding Judge Kang.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.127
No.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.421
Kang Sin-u's father.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.065
Honey.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.767
You should go.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.145
I'd prefer to talk

01:45.355 --> 01:46.898
tomorrow at work.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.540
Okay.

02:04.791 --> 02:08.169
I'll talk to you at the office.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.993
<i>Please, report it yourself</i>

03:00.889 --> 03:01.973
<i>We must be wrong.</i>

03:02.640 --> 03:06.769
There must be something
we don't know about.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.438
If this is all true,

03:09.647 --> 03:12.901
Presiding Judge Kang wouldn't have been
chosen for this case.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.862
Didn't you see how flustered he was?

03:16.362 --> 03:18.114
Defending him won't help.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.366
I'm just saying we need to be careful.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.118
Are you sure you're not in denial?

03:24.537 --> 03:25.705
But the trial tomorrow…

03:25.788 --> 03:29.125
There won't be a trial.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.211
It'll be assigned to another department.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.254
Judge Sim.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.632
I get where you're going with this,
but please!

03:40.220 --> 03:41.596
I want some silence.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.786
Where's Presiding Judge Kang?

04:05.662 --> 04:08.081
I think he came to work, but I'm not…

04:15.088 --> 04:19.050
Judge Sim, the trial schedule
still hasn't changed.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.301
What?

04:21.552 --> 04:22.387
It can't be…

04:24.889 --> 04:28.601
10:00, OBSTRUCTION OF BUSINESS, ROOM 201
KANG WON-JUNG, SIM EUN-SEOK, CHA TAE-JU

04:28.685 --> 04:29.852
Come in.

04:30.770 --> 04:35.650
You're not dressed yet.
I thought the trial was at ten today.

04:35.733 --> 04:39.862
Well, today's trial could be postponed.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.490
Presiding Judge Kang has already
changed into his robes.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.658
What?

04:45.243 --> 04:46.369
Come in.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.964
Yes. What's going on?

04:58.047 --> 05:00.258
I would like to ask that question.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.052
Have you not told the Chief Judge yet?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.472
Gosh, you're so straitlaced.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.059
There are 18 juveniles.

05:10.643 --> 05:14.439
There are over 40 people
including guardians and witnesses.

05:15.481 --> 05:20.194
These people had to take
a day off from work to be here.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.904
So…

05:23.239 --> 05:24.949
how can we just cancel the trial?

05:27.243 --> 05:29.746
The case will be assigned to
another justice department.

05:31.122 --> 05:34.709
I think telling them as soon as possible
would be more considerate.

05:36.544 --> 05:37.920
Didn't you cross enough lines

05:40.214 --> 05:41.924
at the hospital already?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.974
Change into your robes.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.037
During the last trial, I announced
that we will be quick and thorough

06:11.120 --> 06:13.372
as this case is receiving
much public attention.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.792
Today's trial will also be quick.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.587
Presiding Judge Kang.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.173
Prosecution, please go ahead.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.926
Under Article 18, Section 1,
Clause 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act

06:25.009 --> 06:28.554
we demand that the trial be held
by a different collegiate.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.435
Your reasoning?

06:34.519 --> 06:36.938
Ms. Han Ji-won, the witness requested by
the prosecution, is an important witness

06:37.021 --> 06:40.358
who first suspected that the papers
were leaked by the teaching director.

06:40.441 --> 06:44.570
However, the court refused
to accept any faculty members,

06:44.654 --> 06:47.490
including Ms. Han Ji-won, as witnesses
without reasonable cause.

06:47.573 --> 06:51.994
Therefore, we challenge the fairness
of the current collegiate.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.084
The prosecution's challenge
is believed to have been made

06:58.167 --> 07:01.504
with the purpose of delaying the
trial process without any special reason.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.298
It'll be dismissed according to
Article 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.093
Your Honor!
We were just saying the witness--

07:07.176 --> 07:08.136
Dismissed.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.560
Prosecution, please go ahead.

07:21.774 --> 07:25.570
-Prosecution, can't you hear me?
-Court will be adjourned for an hour.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.908
-Judge Sim.
-Silence!

07:31.451 --> 07:34.620
The court will be adjourned for an hour
as the trial is not proceeding smoothly.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.669
Are you out of your mind?

07:43.421 --> 07:45.715
You're just an associate judge!

07:47.133 --> 07:49.927
You should be disciplined for this!

07:52.430 --> 07:55.057
How dare you adjourn
the court without my permission?

07:55.975 --> 07:57.351
This trial is being rushed.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.064
What did you say?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.775
The reason for the prosecution's challenge
was convincing.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.571
Our court is obligated to explain
the reasons for the witness selection.

08:10.072 --> 08:11.782
Why are you rushing the trial?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.910
What gives you the right?

08:16.245 --> 08:18.247
Have you forgotten what I told you

08:20.750 --> 08:21.751
at the hospital?

08:22.752 --> 08:23.878
Judge Sim!

08:23.961 --> 08:25.046
I can't let you…

08:27.173 --> 08:28.424
hold such a rushed trial.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.303
I'm reporting this to the Chief Judge.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.722
Do you have proof?

08:38.184 --> 08:40.561
Was my son's name
on the teaching director's list

08:41.604 --> 08:45.775
that the prosecution submitted?

08:47.151 --> 08:48.194
Or…

08:49.987 --> 08:53.574
do you have proof
that my son was a part of Descartes?

08:56.244 --> 08:57.995
Not circumstantial evidence.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.540
Real hard evidence

09:01.707 --> 09:03.125
that my son was involved

09:04.919 --> 09:06.212
or a witness.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.218
You don't, do you?

09:26.899 --> 09:27.984
Go.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.988
Go and report it to him.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.242
I will…

09:40.204 --> 09:41.956
end you.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.677
There are things

09:56.095 --> 09:58.764
I've been planning for a long time.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.354
If you want to stop me,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.274
bring me a reliable witness…

10:11.527 --> 10:12.737
or some hard evidence.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.913
Not that there is any.

10:43.225 --> 10:44.477
Judge Sim, we should--

11:16.676 --> 11:18.594
I thought you went home.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.012
No, I just…

11:27.061 --> 11:28.187
I've been…

11:30.773 --> 11:33.901
thinking about it.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.200
Why don't we just stop here?

11:45.663 --> 11:49.375
Frankly, everything Presiding Judge Kang
said is true.

11:50.042 --> 11:54.130
Our job is to judge, not to investigate
what the prosecution might have missed.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.716
The court doesn't have the authority
to investigate or prosecute.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.555
Besides…

12:03.722 --> 12:06.434
we don't have any hard evidence.

12:07.309 --> 12:12.148
And he's still our colleague and boss.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.777
We shouldn't be doubting him…

12:19.738 --> 12:22.825
and digging for information.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.580
It makes me uncomfortable.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.551
Right.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.265
I guess you could feel that way.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.814
You can quit the trial then.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.528
-I think that's the right thing to do.
-What about you?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.240
I'll take care of myself.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.651
MOONKWANG HIGH ALLOWS STUDENTS
INVOLVED IN EXAM PAPER LEAK TO DROP OUT

13:39.401 --> 13:41.487
Do not allow students to drop out!

13:41.570 --> 13:43.322
-Do not allow!
-Do not allow!

13:43.405 --> 13:45.991
Apologize to the students who suffered!

13:46.075 --> 13:47.826
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

13:47.910 --> 13:49.954
They shouldn't be allowed to drop out!

13:50.037 --> 13:50.996
Moonkwang High?

13:51.747 --> 13:53.082
It's such a shame.

13:57.211 --> 14:01.882
Only kids with outstanding grades are
in the A level of our academy.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.636
As you can see,
all the boys here are from Moonkwang High.

14:05.719 --> 14:09.181
It's a miracle that a regular high school
sends 30 to 40 students

14:09.265 --> 14:10.724
to prestigious colleges every year.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.269
That's what makes this even sadder.

14:13.352 --> 14:17.231
The 18 children who received
the leaked papers dropped out yesterday.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.568
<i>Let me simplify this for you.</i>

14:22.152 --> 14:23.445
These are the students.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.157
Your grades drop to zero
if you're expelled,

14:27.241 --> 14:28.450
so you have a lot to lose.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.244
But dropping out is different.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.706
All your extracurricular grades
are still intact when you leave.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.375
-I see.
-The necessary grades for early admission

14:36.458 --> 14:38.168
can be replaced with top GED scores.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.671
And if you add
the extracurricular grades to that

14:40.754 --> 14:43.007
you'll be at an advantage
if you're aiming for SNU.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.928
So they're not losing anything
despite receiving the exam answer sheets.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.180
But do you know
what the biggest problem is?

14:50.931 --> 14:53.517
Right here. The students that are left.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.437
Students who get good grades,
but come from poor families.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.566
Because of the recent events, all the
students will be retaking the exams.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.819
The total number of students
have decreased because of the dropouts,

15:03.903 --> 15:06.488
and the exams are evaluated relatively.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.574
What the hell, man?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.075
So the remaining students need to

15:10.159 --> 15:13.829
put their lives on the line and compete
with each other to get on top.

15:13.913 --> 15:18.542
Well-off children can get
tutoring and prepare for the test,

15:18.626 --> 15:21.045
but what about those who can't afford it?

15:21.128 --> 15:23.297
Early admissions will be open soon,

15:23.380 --> 15:25.966
so they'll be busy preparing
their résumés and interviews.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.093
But now they have to retake the test too.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.720
It's a bolt out of the blue.

15:29.803 --> 15:34.141
Everything they prepared for will go down
the drain because of those other kids.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.061
<i>But still,</i>

15:37.144 --> 15:40.564
<i>The school shouldn't be allowing this.</i>

15:41.941 --> 15:47.237
STUDY CAFE, MATH ACADEMY,
STUDY ROOMS, ENGLISH ACADEMY

15:48.280 --> 15:50.449
<i>This isn't just a matter of ethics.</i>

15:51.367 --> 15:55.162
<i>These children's futures are being
trampled on by the selfishness of adults.</i>

15:58.916 --> 16:00.334
<i>That darn school…</i>

16:01.001 --> 16:03.295
They allowed the kids
who saw the leaked papers to drop out.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.506
What's the point in retaking
the exams now?

16:06.173 --> 16:08.008
The trust in the public education system

16:08.884 --> 16:11.136
and fairness weren't the only problems.

16:14.765 --> 16:18.143
The kids who dropped out
will have a leg up getting into college.

16:18.852 --> 16:23.524
While the innocent students are the ones
who have been affected by this.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.695
The trial has already lost all fairness.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.990
The perpetrator and the children involved
weren't even mentioned.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.994
Everything's a mess.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.162
Should we…

16:39.623 --> 16:40.666
still stop?

16:47.631 --> 16:50.300
How's the trial? Is it going well?

16:51.677 --> 16:54.888
I think it'll end well, thanks to you.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.977
What did I tell you?

17:00.060 --> 17:01.854
I told you everything would be fine.

17:01.937 --> 17:05.774
Well, the teaching director
kept it under wraps in the first place,

17:06.483 --> 17:08.569
and my son got out
before it became a problem,

17:10.654 --> 17:12.448
so there's no proof against him.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.868
It's just their grades.
They're making such a big deal out of it.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.494
It's the press that's the problem.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.788
If this isn't sensationalizing,
I don't know what is.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.956
Gosh.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.586
You're right.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.668
<i>But there's no other way.</i>

18:06.752 --> 18:08.587
<i>We don't have any proof or witnesses.</i>

18:10.964 --> 18:12.049
<i>Proof.</i>

18:12.800 --> 18:13.759
<i>Witness.</i>

18:15.052 --> 18:16.845
<i>Do we really have nothing?</i>

18:18.097 --> 18:19.223
<i>Nothing at all?</i>

18:27.481 --> 18:30.609
I had a great time being on this show.

18:30.692 --> 18:31.860
<i>CURRENT EVENTS N ISSUES</i>

18:31.944 --> 18:33.278
It's such a shame.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.738
Though I'll be leaving,

18:35.405 --> 18:39.952
I hope you continue to watch
<i>Current Events N Issues</i>.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.122
Yes, thank you for everything,
Presiding Judge Kang.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.540
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.000
<i>And that's it for today's
Current Events N Issues.</i>

18:47.084 --> 18:47.918
<i>Thank you.</i>

18:48.794 --> 18:49.711
Great work, everyone.

18:49.795 --> 18:50.754
Thank you!

18:50.838 --> 18:51.713
Great job.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.382
-Great work.
-Good job.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.384
-Great work, everyone.
-You too.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.219
A job well done!

18:57.302 --> 18:59.096
-Great work!
-Great work!

19:02.307 --> 19:04.226
It was such an honor,
Presiding Judge Kang.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.186
Gosh, you didn't have to…

19:06.270 --> 19:08.897
Thank you for being with us
for over two years.

19:08.981 --> 19:09.940
Thank you.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.368
Our director made a reservation
at a fancy restaurant.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.536
Come with us, Presiding Judge Kang.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.455
The second round will be on me then.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.751
Give him a round of applause!
Did you hear him?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.920
-Let's clean up quickly, okay?
-Yes, sir.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.714
Yes. We're having meat!

Hey. What is it?

20:03.118 --> 20:04.453
I heard you wanted to see me.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.664
Is it true?

20:12.878 --> 20:15.297
As per Lee Seok-hyeon's claim,
we've managed to--

20:15.380 --> 20:16.757
Gosh, you're so frustrating.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.639
Didn't I make myself clear?

20:24.973 --> 20:26.600
We do not investigate.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.519
I told you to drop it.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.942
How dare you bring this
to the chief judge?

20:35.025 --> 20:35.984
Presiding Judge Kang.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.070
She even came to the hospital!

20:39.947 --> 20:41.490
As if my son
being hospitalized wasn't enough,

20:41.573 --> 20:43.492
you told me, your superior,
to turn myself in.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.994
You come to me
solely based on what some kid said.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.288
She doesn't have any proof or witnesses!

20:50.958 --> 20:51.959
I do…

20:53.835 --> 20:54.878
have proof.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.134
I have proof.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.476
Look here, Judge Sim.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.938
I've checked the files we have
on that case a million times,

21:13.021 --> 21:14.856
including the ones from the prosecution.

21:14.940 --> 21:18.277
No matter what record you look at…

21:20.612 --> 21:21.989
there's no proof or witnesses.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.865
Of course, there isn't.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.202
Because it's a confession.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.707
Moonkwang High, class 1, senior…

21:34.209 --> 21:35.210
Kang Sin-u.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.800
He confessed today.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.810
If this is your first time,
you'll be a first-time offender.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.563
And if you confess,

21:56.356 --> 21:58.692
the prosecution will handle it
as a protection case.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.403
I can guarantee that.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.031
Just because you're taking
a detour for a year or two,

22:04.614 --> 22:06.033
doesn't mean your life is over.

22:06.742 --> 22:07.701
I know.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.413
So I was going to confess, but…

22:11.496 --> 22:12.581
But?

22:15.375 --> 22:16.752
Because of your dad?

22:16.835 --> 22:21.423
I'd be betraying him.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.758
Think again.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.970
You won't be betraying your dad.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.057
It's your friends.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.518
Everyone makes mistakes.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.355
But the most important thing…

22:39.775 --> 22:40.859
is what happens after.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.361
What you do after that

22:45.030 --> 22:46.990
will determine who you'll become.

22:48.742 --> 22:49.993
Think about it.

22:50.577 --> 22:53.997
Think about who you want to be
with this decision.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.458
Sim Eun-seok!

22:59.836 --> 23:02.005
This is a load of nonsense.

23:04.424 --> 23:08.553
You've been disgracing me
since the last trial, and now this?

23:09.262 --> 23:14.101
Chief, I'm terribly sorry about this.
It's all my fault.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.812
Hey. Come out right now.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.022
That's enough.

23:19.689 --> 23:20.941
Chief.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.110
Chief, it's…

23:32.577 --> 23:33.578
Just give me a day.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.750
I need some time to think.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.797
Okay.

23:47.092 --> 23:54.099
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
CHIEF JUDGE'S OFFICE

23:58.228 --> 23:59.646
Why are you doing this?

24:03.108 --> 24:04.151
Why?

24:07.696 --> 24:08.738
Go ahead.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.259
Just once.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.681
It was just once.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.144
There was something I had to do.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.270
I know.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.405
THE JUVENILE ACT REVISION BOARD
PRESIDING JUDGE KANG WON-JUNG

24:56.328 --> 24:58.496
STUDY ON REVISING AND IMPROVING
THE JUVENILE ACT

25:00.248 --> 25:04.085
I heard you've been preparing to revise
the Juvenile Act for the past five years.

25:05.503 --> 25:08.131
You worked on it harder than anyone.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.928
That's why you want to join
the National Assembly.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.139
You're even giving up being a judge.

25:21.519 --> 25:25.815
Stop denying it
and at least take a look at the data.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.109
Look at how many violent crimes
are being committed by young offenders.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.445
They should be met
with harsher punishment.

25:30.528 --> 25:33.573
Our priority is to raise
the quality of the protection they receive

25:33.657 --> 25:35.033
with increased resources.

25:35.116 --> 25:38.620
That way, we can prevent crimes
and prevent repeat offenders.

25:38.703 --> 25:42.499
Do you know how many kids
a single probation officer handles?

25:42.582 --> 25:44.542
It's over 100 kids.

25:45.168 --> 25:50.924
<i>Juvenile crimes are
being portrayed as violent by the press.</i>

25:52.050 --> 25:53.802
<i>Society has no concrete plans.</i>

25:53.885 --> 25:56.471
<i>They just keep insisting
that we abolish the Juvenile Act.</i>

25:57.681 --> 26:00.850
<i>Law isn't the problem. It's the system.</i>

26:01.935 --> 26:04.104
<i>Out of all the developed countries,</i>

26:04.187 --> 26:07.899
<i>we have the least amount
of resources and facilities.</i>

26:08.608 --> 26:10.110
<i>So if someone has to do it,</i>

26:11.278 --> 26:14.322
<i>it has to be someone who knows
the ins and outs of the Juvenile Act.</i>

26:14.406 --> 26:16.241
There's even a study that shows

26:16.324 --> 26:18.660
that after enforcing harsher punishment
on juvenile offenders,

26:18.743 --> 26:20.078
it resulted in higher recidivism rates.

26:20.161 --> 26:23.581
The focus of the Juvenile Act
should be on rehabilitation!

26:27.752 --> 26:28.837
Five years.

26:30.588 --> 26:32.090
I prepared for over five years.

26:36.469 --> 26:37.846
I was confident I'd do well.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.313
But…

26:51.943 --> 26:53.611
you screwed it up.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.625
Who was the Juvenile Act made for?

27:09.502 --> 27:11.671
For the adolescents, of course.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.715
Then what about the victimized
adolescents of Moonkwang High?

27:23.350 --> 27:25.143
How can you revise a law for adolescents

27:26.978 --> 27:29.064
while trampling on them?

27:32.484 --> 27:34.235
Do you even know

27:35.737 --> 27:37.364
what the students at Moonkwang High

27:38.573 --> 27:40.700
are going through

27:42.410 --> 27:43.536
right now?

27:48.249 --> 27:50.919
<i>Should we still stop?</i>

27:53.088 --> 27:54.547
No, we shouldn't.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.346
Juvenile Judges deal with children.

28:03.515 --> 28:07.435
Our denial as juvenile judges
affects them directly.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.649
Even if everyone denies them,
we should not.

28:14.692 --> 28:15.652
Because we are…

28:19.197 --> 28:21.032
the last line of defense for those kids.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.830
They say that we shouldn't steal a candle
to read the Bible.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.833
This means when the methods are corrupt,

28:31.876 --> 28:33.837
its purpose is also tainted.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.635
Judge Cha once asked me…

28:44.055 --> 28:45.974
if I keep a case journal.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.730
<i>He said that you do</i>

28:52.480 --> 28:55.775
<i>and that not only
do you write about the case,</i>

28:55.859 --> 28:58.153
<i>you also write
what you regret about the trial.</i>

28:59.654 --> 29:03.032
<i>You record over
300 cases a month in your journal</i>

29:03.116 --> 29:06.703
<i>and reflect back on them.</i>

29:09.539 --> 29:11.833
And you probably decided
to revise the Juvenile Act

29:13.168 --> 29:15.336
when you were writing your journal.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.843
But…

29:25.096 --> 29:26.014
Presiding Judge Kang.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.978
In that journal
you've been keeping for 22 years…

29:35.064 --> 29:36.566
what will you write…

29:41.279 --> 29:43.031
about this case?

29:56.294 --> 29:57.837
So just admit it.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.135
You should be punished
for what you did wrong.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.390
Whether it's a child…

30:12.936 --> 30:14.062
or a judge.

31:55.788 --> 31:58.917
NO ACCESS OUTSIDE VISITING HOURS

32:25.068 --> 32:26.110
Chief.

32:29.405 --> 32:30.865
It's me, Kang Won-jung.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.787
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
JUVENILE CRIMINAL COLLEGIATE DIVISION

32:37.330 --> 32:38.623
Who are you?

32:38.706 --> 32:40.375
We're from the Ethics Committee.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.919
We have consent from Presiding Judge Kang.
Did he call you?

32:43.586 --> 32:44.629
Hold on.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.092
Wait. Hold on!

33:29.799 --> 33:32.969
<i>The incident caused
great shock, anger, and distrust</i>

33:33.052 --> 33:35.471
to students who studied hard

33:35.555 --> 33:38.224
and the parents who supported them.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.477
However, he did not participate
in the leak continuously,

33:42.145 --> 33:44.605
and he showed an attitude of
reflection by confessing,

33:44.689 --> 33:46.399
so the disposition is as follows.

33:47.483 --> 33:50.987
<i>The public is enraged
after the confession of</i>

33:51.070 --> 33:54.198
<i>Presiding Judge Kang Won-jung
of Yeonhwa District Court</i>

33:54.282 --> 33:56.659
<i>regarding the Moonkwang
Exam Paper Leak Scandal.</i>

33:56.743 --> 34:01.873
<i>The Liberty Party excluded
Judge Kang Won-jung from the by-election.</i>

34:01.956 --> 34:04.459
<i>Many civil groups have filed a complaint</i>

34:04.542 --> 34:08.379
<i>and a disciplinary committee will be held
at the Supreme Court this afternoon.</i>

34:24.812 --> 34:26.064
SUPREME COURT DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

34:43.623 --> 34:47.627
Isn't Presiding Judge Kang coming
to the courthouse today to grab his stuff?

34:49.003 --> 34:51.506
-I think he said two o'clock.
-Yes.

34:52.298 --> 34:54.509
Shouldn't we go and say goodbye?

34:54.592 --> 34:55.885
We should.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.430
Judge Sim told me we should.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.349
She asked us to see him off

35:02.183 --> 35:04.352
since she has a trial today.

35:04.435 --> 35:05.686
Right, she's busy.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.357
What was the result
of the disciplinary action?

35:09.440 --> 35:10.817
<i>The disposition is as follows.</i>

35:10.900 --> 35:15.655
Regarding the grading of students
that should have been conducted fairly,

35:15.738 --> 35:19.033
you deprived students of
the opportunity to compete fairly.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.953
Not only did you interfere
with the exam process,

35:22.036 --> 35:25.414
but you also destroyed the public's trust
in public education.

35:26.165 --> 35:30.211
But you only attempted
to obtain the exam papers,

35:30.294 --> 35:32.171
but never actually did.

35:32.255 --> 35:35.299
Repenting for what you've done
will also be taken into account.

35:36.050 --> 35:38.761
Lee Seok-hyeon, you will do
120 hours of volunteer work

35:40.555 --> 35:42.849
and will be on long term probation
for two years.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.935
I hereby sentence probations
one, three, and five.

35:50.857 --> 35:53.609
-It's over, Seok-hyeon. Let's go.
-This way.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.744
Okay. Let's part ways here.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.205
-Head back inside.
-Presiding Judge Kang.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.082
We should still walk you to your car.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.458
Take care, sir.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.670
-Take care.
-Thank you.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.381
Goodbye, sir.

36:21.053 --> 36:22.388
Thank you for everything.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.765
For putting up
with such an ill-tempered boss.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.225
-No, of course not.
-No.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.310
Bye.

36:45.244 --> 36:46.871
How many cases do we have left?

36:46.954 --> 36:48.331
We have quite a bit today.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.167
We still have eight more to go.

36:57.924 --> 36:58.799
Presiding Judge Kang!

36:59.425 --> 37:00.426
Presiding Judge Kang.

37:01.844 --> 37:03.596
-Let me hold that for you.
-It's okay.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.264
Please. I insist.

37:06.849 --> 37:08.434
Are you parked in your usual spot?

37:08.517 --> 37:09.518
Yes.

37:20.404 --> 37:24.116
You knew I used to be
at a reformatory, right?

37:37.630 --> 37:38.714
Well…

37:42.009 --> 37:44.387
I've been looking for the judge

37:45.680 --> 37:47.223
who helped me long ago.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.939
But no matter how hard I looked,
I couldn't find him.

37:58.150 --> 37:59.110
But…

37:59.735 --> 38:01.529
BUSAN JUVENILE REFORMATORY

38:02.738 --> 38:03.614
Hello.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.366
<i>Hello, Judge Cha!</i>

38:05.449 --> 38:07.535
-<i>Gosh, it's been a while.</i>
-It has.

38:07.618 --> 38:10.830
<i>I'm calling because
we still have your records</i>

38:10.913 --> 38:13.916
<i>from when you were young.</i>

38:14.000 --> 38:16.043
<i>Would you like us to send them to you?</i>

38:37.732 --> 38:40.693
What are you doing in this photo?

39:03.466 --> 39:04.508
Hello.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.553
I will be joining Yeonhwa District Court's
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

39:07.636 --> 39:09.472
My name is Cha Tae-ju.

39:38.959 --> 39:41.629
<i>For someone trying to make a fresh start…</i>

39:43.923 --> 39:45.800
<i>their past can at times be a wound.</i>

39:50.930 --> 39:52.431
I recognized you right away.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.227
I was grateful

39:59.271 --> 40:00.856
to see how you turned out.

40:20.376 --> 40:21.252
Presiding Judge Kang.

40:35.057 --> 40:36.767
Gosh, you and your temper.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.147
You never say thank you, do you?

40:47.778 --> 40:49.447
You promised me, okay?

40:50.865 --> 40:52.116
Never to stand trial again.

40:56.871 --> 40:59.165
Thank you so much…

41:02.543 --> 41:04.086
for scolding me…

41:09.258 --> 41:11.385
and taking my side.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.474
You've already paid me back
for everything…

41:17.266 --> 41:18.392
At court,

41:20.227 --> 41:22.480
to all the children
who stood trial before you.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.194
So, go.

41:30.446 --> 41:31.572
Get back to work.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.159
Don't ever

41:36.952 --> 41:38.496
follow in my footsteps.

43:27.646 --> 43:30.524
<i>I have nothing against you.</i>

43:32.109 --> 43:34.111
<i>You were right.</i>

43:35.321 --> 43:37.364
<i>Take care</i>

43:38.365 --> 43:42.953
<i>and I hope to see you again.</i>

43:47.625 --> 43:49.710
<i>I heard you were good
since you were a trainee.</i>

43:50.210 --> 43:54.923
You surpassed all your male classmates
and entered the Central District Court.

43:55.591 --> 43:58.093
And you even went overseas
for further training on top of that.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.943
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

44:15.027 --> 44:16.987
Just quit if you're going to
spew such nonsense.

44:17.071 --> 44:20.324
Do you think we're the police?
Why are you stepping over the line?

44:20.407 --> 44:22.076
You imbeciles!

44:22.159 --> 44:25.371
I told you not to, didn't I?
I made myself very clear!

45:38.527 --> 45:39.778
Hello, Judge Cha.

45:39.862 --> 45:40.863
Hello.

45:51.457 --> 45:52.749
Hello.

45:55.210 --> 45:56.795
You're still here?

45:59.256 --> 46:00.424
Did you pull an all-nighter?

46:00.507 --> 46:02.926
No, I just couldn't sleep.

46:06.221 --> 46:07.306
Me neither.

46:13.729 --> 46:14.688
Gosh.

46:19.943 --> 46:21.153
Come with me for a second.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.030
We need to talk.

46:31.121 --> 46:32.831
A lot of things are going to change

46:35.042 --> 46:36.502
a little bit at a time.

46:40.172 --> 46:42.925
Things will get uncomfortable.

46:43.884 --> 46:46.970
WHAT HORRIBLE ASSOCIATE JUDGES
INVESTIGATING THEIR OWN BOSS LIKE THAT

46:47.638 --> 46:48.889
<i>But it's something</i>

46:50.140 --> 46:52.142
<i>that had to be done.</i>

46:52.226 --> 46:53.185
HOW FRIGHTENING, THOSE ASSOCIATES

46:54.728 --> 46:58.357
<i>And I believe we were the ones who did it.</i>

47:02.486 --> 47:03.362
What about you?

47:11.620 --> 47:12.579
Me too.

47:14.706 --> 47:15.832
Okay, then.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.510
-Hey!
-Hey!

47:29.304 --> 47:32.224
<i>Vehicle 4558! Stop the car!</i>

47:32.307 --> 47:35.185
<i>I repeat, stop the car!</i>

47:35.269 --> 47:37.813
<i>Vehicle 4558! Stop the car!</i>

47:46.113 --> 47:48.532
Vehicle 4558! Stop!

47:55.205 --> 47:59.710
Do you remember
the underage traffic accident case?

48:00.294 --> 48:04.548
Seventeen-year-old minors
rented an SUV with fake IDs

48:04.631 --> 48:08.302
and caused an accident
while running away after being caught.

48:08.385 --> 48:09.845
Stop the car!

48:09.928 --> 48:10.887
That son of a…

48:18.604 --> 48:21.857
-Stop! Stop, you lunatic!
-It hurts!

48:23.233 --> 48:24.735
You're going to get us killed.

48:24.818 --> 48:25.944
Just shut the fuck up!

48:26.612 --> 48:27.696
-Hey.
-Damn it.

48:27.779 --> 48:30.032
If we get caught, we're dead either way.

48:30.115 --> 48:31.825
So just shut up.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.623
-You're going to hit someone!
-Stop the car!

48:37.706 --> 48:39.207
Hey, stop it!

48:47.591 --> 48:48.467
Damn it.

48:48.550 --> 48:49.635
My gosh.

48:52.846 --> 48:53.847
Stop the car!

49:03.940 --> 49:06.068
<i>The victim's name is O Gyu-sang.</i>

49:06.151 --> 49:08.987
<i>He's a 30-year-old breadwinner
and has a temp job as an engineer.</i>

49:09.071 --> 49:11.114
<i>He works at a repair shop during the day</i>

49:11.198 --> 49:14.660
<i>and part-times as a deliveryman at night,
which is when he got in the accident.</i>

49:14.743 --> 49:16.244
Wait a minute.

49:16.828 --> 49:19.247
-He's bleeding too much.
-You have to give them space.

49:19.331 --> 49:22.292
-I want to see daddy.
-Ye-ji, come here. It's okay.

49:22.376 --> 49:23.669
How's he doing?

49:23.752 --> 49:27.255
Mr. O and the SUV driver are
in critical condition

49:27.339 --> 49:29.841
and the rest just suffered minor injuries.

49:29.925 --> 49:31.802
Let's discuss the case when
Presiding Judge Kang's replacement comes.

49:31.885 --> 49:34.429
His replacement will be
coming two days later, not today.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.515
They're wrapping up a previous case.

49:36.598 --> 49:39.559
You'll have to handle this case alone

49:39.643 --> 49:42.062
since it's a protection case,
not a criminal case.

49:42.145 --> 49:44.147
I just took a brief look.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.608
Forgery, exercising counterfeit documents,

49:46.692 --> 49:47.984
and the violation of
the Resident Registration Act

49:48.068 --> 49:50.320
and the Act on Special Cases
concerning Traffic Accidents.

49:50.404 --> 49:53.073
The victim is also in critical condition,
so why…

49:53.156 --> 49:55.909
YEONHWA POLICE STATION
NAME: KWAK DO-SEOK

49:58.328 --> 49:59.413
Wait.

50:00.872 --> 50:02.290
The kid who was driving…

50:02.374 --> 50:05.335
Are you giving up
on taekwondo for good, Do-seok?

50:05.419 --> 50:07.838
I'm looking into becoming
a security guard.

50:07.921 --> 50:10.966
I already got a license
and passed the GED at the facility.

50:11.591 --> 50:12.843
This kid…

50:19.975 --> 50:23.395
What's Do-seok's file doing there?

50:24.604 --> 50:25.522
Tell me.

50:26.231 --> 50:29.818
Tell us why this is a protection case.

50:29.901 --> 50:30.861
Well, the thing is…

50:30.944 --> 50:32.112
Mr. Seo…

50:32.195 --> 50:34.322
Please, tell me.

50:35.115 --> 50:38.285
Do-seok had hung out with
delinquents for a while in the past,

50:38.368 --> 50:40.495
and he seems to have gotten
in touch with them again recently.

50:40.579 --> 50:42.038
And as for the prosecution…

50:42.122 --> 50:44.458
A former-official?
An assistant chief prosecutor?

50:44.541 --> 50:45.959
It's just speculation.

50:46.710 --> 50:49.045
Right now, all eyes are on us.

50:49.129 --> 50:50.881
Whether it's special treatment or not,

50:50.964 --> 50:53.759
you can't blow things
out of proportion, Judge Sim.

50:58.221 --> 50:59.264
Okay.

51:00.599 --> 51:01.892
I'll keep that in mind.

51:11.234 --> 51:13.153
It's not like him to do that.

51:14.446 --> 51:17.616
<i>Even when he did
something wrong, he had his limits.</i>

51:18.283 --> 51:21.495
<i>He was even aiming to become
a security guard.</i>

51:21.578 --> 51:23.663
Are you saying
that the records were forged?

51:24.456 --> 51:27.375
Are you saying that
since Kwak Do-seok has limits…

51:28.001 --> 51:32.506
Or are you saying that he's a victim
since he's also in a critical state?

51:34.716 --> 51:35.926
No, it's not that--

51:36.009 --> 51:38.428
Kwak Do-seok isn't
what's important right now.

51:39.137 --> 51:40.555
Because of him and his group,

51:41.389 --> 51:43.809
an innocent man is in critical condition.

52:22.097 --> 52:26.142
DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
ASSAULT AND EXTORTION

52:28.812 --> 52:31.064
SINGLE-PARENT HOUSEHOLD
TAEKWONDO, HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT

52:32.399 --> 52:34.693
UNDERAGE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT CASE
SCENE PHOTOS

52:45.328 --> 52:46.830
You should go home for today.

52:49.624 --> 52:51.001
Go and get some rest.

52:52.961 --> 52:55.088
Nothing's getting in your head anyway.

52:58.758 --> 52:59.759
I'll do that.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.110
I'll get going then.

53:19.446 --> 53:20.906
Judge Cha.

53:23.116 --> 53:24.743
Go straight home.

53:55.315 --> 53:56.274
Are you sure

53:56.858 --> 53:58.568
that you didn't know anything?

53:58.652 --> 54:01.363
Yes, if you take a look at
the rental car dashcam footage--

54:01.446 --> 54:03.448
I was asking the children.

54:05.700 --> 54:09.496
-Yes, but as their counsel--
-This is a juvenile protection case.

54:10.330 --> 54:13.792
I have to hear it from them.

54:21.132 --> 54:23.468
I really didn't know anything.

54:23.551 --> 54:25.762
He just told me to get in the car,
so I did.

54:25.845 --> 54:27.597
And no one doubted him?

54:28.932 --> 54:30.350
Well?

54:30.433 --> 54:32.018
When he just brought a car out of nowhere?

54:32.102 --> 54:34.688
I thought he got a license
since it was past his birthday.

54:34.771 --> 54:38.149
And he throws a fit
if we don't listen to him.

54:42.570 --> 54:44.155
She's right.

54:59.129 --> 55:00.255
You guys are underage, right?

55:02.799 --> 55:05.010
-Stop the car! Stop!
-Catch them!

55:05.093 --> 55:06.511
<i>Vehicle 4558 is on the run.</i>

55:06.594 --> 55:08.138
<i>White vehicle with plate number
4558 is on the run.</i>

55:08.221 --> 55:09.514
<i>Requesting support from
Gangnam Intersection Control Team.</i>

55:09.597 --> 55:11.266
<i>If he tells us to do something,
we have to do it.</i>

55:11.349 --> 55:13.643
We shouldn't have hung out with him
in the first place.

55:13.727 --> 55:16.438
As you've just heard,
this isn't aiding and abetting.

55:16.521 --> 55:20.066
They got in the car because
they thought he had a valid license.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.902
They have nothing to do with
forgery, exercising counterfeit documents,

55:22.986 --> 55:26.614
and the violation of
the Resident Registration Act.

55:26.698 --> 55:29.242
It's the complete opposite of claims
put forward by Kwak Do-seok's guardian.

55:29.909 --> 55:32.162
A petition was filed today,

55:32.245 --> 55:36.332
that states that everything was done
under the coercion of Lee Nam-gyeong.

55:37.459 --> 55:41.796
So the two sides of the story
don't match up, do they?

55:47.927 --> 55:50.513
This case isn't as easy as
I thought it would be.

55:51.222 --> 55:54.100
They won't admit to the crime
and are busy blaming each other.

55:54.934 --> 55:57.187
I know, right? Gosh.

56:03.318 --> 56:06.780
Judge Sim. Mr. O's wife is here.

56:14.913 --> 56:17.457
My due date is nearing.

56:20.043 --> 56:21.878
I'm just having a really hard time.

56:24.089 --> 56:25.131
I was hoping

56:26.132 --> 56:28.635
you could end the trial
as quickly as possible.

56:31.763 --> 56:33.139
I just came to say that.

56:37.852 --> 56:39.395
She has childhood depression.

56:41.606 --> 56:43.650
I wasn't the only one having a hard time.

56:45.485 --> 56:46.653
She knew…

56:47.946 --> 56:49.364
She knew everything.

56:52.158 --> 56:55.578
I just want my husband to recover

56:55.662 --> 56:57.247
so that our family can go back…

57:00.291 --> 57:02.127
to the way we used to be.

57:04.671 --> 57:06.422
All the perpetrators

57:08.341 --> 57:10.510
are refusing to admit to the crime.

57:13.388 --> 57:14.889
You have the right to know

57:15.723 --> 57:18.643
why and how your husband…

57:22.230 --> 57:23.982
got in that accident.

57:33.450 --> 57:34.367
Yes.

57:39.664 --> 57:40.748
I know.

57:43.877 --> 57:45.628
I heard they are all underage.

57:50.592 --> 57:55.388
How could they be so brazen
at such a young age?

58:11.613 --> 58:13.990
Is that what they said?

58:14.073 --> 58:16.326
Gosh, how ridiculous.

58:16.993 --> 58:18.369
They're wrong, Judge Sim.

58:19.078 --> 58:22.123
This is so unfair. They're all lying.

58:25.293 --> 58:28.588
Look. Does this look like
they're repenting right now?

58:29.839 --> 58:33.301
They would call him out
in the middle of the night.

58:33.384 --> 58:36.346
I tried reasoning with them,
scolding them,

58:36.429 --> 58:38.181
but they kept coming to our house.

58:38.264 --> 58:42.560
RIGHT BEFORE GOING TO TRIAL.
I'M GOING TO CRY UP A STORM

58:42.644 --> 58:44.479
NAME: KWAK **-SEOK, MALE, AGE 17

58:46.689 --> 58:48.483
<i>Do-seok rented the car?</i>

58:49.275 --> 58:50.610
<i>He was driving?</i>

58:51.444 --> 58:52.737
<i>He probably did.</i>

58:53.279 --> 58:54.656
<i>So he wouldn't get beaten.</i>

58:56.574 --> 58:58.243
My son is big.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.245
He used to be an athlete.

59:01.788 --> 59:05.792
And because he has a record,
everyone is pointing their fingers at him.

59:05.875 --> 59:09.087
But I swear it wasn't him.

59:19.973 --> 59:21.432
Are you okay?

59:21.516 --> 59:22.517
Hold on.

59:25.061 --> 59:27.981
Yes, I need an ambulance
to Yeonhwa District Court.

59:36.197 --> 59:38.241
Mr. Kwak, can you hear me?

59:38.825 --> 59:40.118
Mr. Kwak.

59:40.201 --> 59:42.870
-Call Dr. Kim. Now.
-Okay.

59:42.954 --> 59:44.163
-Hold him down.
-Okay.

59:46.874 --> 59:48.084
Judge Sim?

59:59.679 --> 1:00:00.722
Who are you?

1:00:01.222 --> 1:00:03.266
So, it's you.

1:00:04.475 --> 1:00:08.313
You're the whistleblower
who kicked her own boss out.

1:00:10.481 --> 1:00:11.566
Who…

1:00:12.358 --> 1:00:13.943
<i>Who told them they could be here?</i>

1:00:14.027 --> 1:00:16.487
What are they doing in my court?

1:00:23.286 --> 1:00:24.621
I'm Na Geun-hee.

1:00:25.330 --> 1:00:27.915
I'm the new presiding judge at
the Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

1:00:33.838 --> 1:00:35.465
Things have gotten a lot easier, right?

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:39.135
I hope we get along.

1:01:06.412 --> 1:01:07.664
Sim Eun-seok speaking.

1:01:08.373 --> 1:01:09.791
<i>Something happened, Judge Sim.</i>

1:01:24.847 --> 1:01:26.766
PRAYING FOR THE VICTIM
#GROWING #REPENTING #KWAK DO-SEOK DID IT

1:01:44.117 --> 1:01:46.703
Do-seok, no…

1:01:51.916 --> 1:01:53.876
Do-seok… Don't go…

1:01:54.877 --> 1:01:56.671
No!

1:02:09.225 --> 1:02:10.226
Do-seok!

1:02:16.816 --> 1:02:18.943
<i>What should we do now?</i>

1:02:21.863 --> 1:02:22.947
<i>Judge Sim?</i>

1:02:25.742 --> 1:02:26.743
We should…

1:02:29.746 --> 1:02:31.164
prepare for the trial.

1:02:32.582 --> 1:02:34.083
<i>What about Judge Cha?</i>

1:02:38.379 --> 1:02:39.630
I'll let him know.

1:02:40.757 --> 1:02:41.883
Good work.

1:02:58.316 --> 1:03:00.860
You haven't gone home yet?

1:03:05.907 --> 1:03:06.908
What…

1:03:08.201 --> 1:03:09.660
What's wrong?

1:03:14.999 --> 1:03:16.542
There's something you should know.

1:03:19.003 --> 1:03:21.589
The driver of the underage
traffic accident case,

1:03:22.548 --> 1:03:23.883
Kwak Do-seok.

1:03:26.385 --> 1:03:27.428
He just

1:03:29.514 --> 1:03:31.182
went into a vegetative state.

1:04:46.507 --> 1:04:49.969
THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS
