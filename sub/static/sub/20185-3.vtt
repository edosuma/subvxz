00:00.362 --> 00:02.963
Previously on AMC's "The Son"...

00:02.965 --> 00:04.965
That's Pedro García's son-in-law!

00:04.967 --> 00:06.834
Who blew up my rig?

00:07.937 --> 00:09.503
What am I supposed to do with him now?

00:09.505 --> 00:11.872
I'm sure you're gonna
do the right thing.

00:11.874 --> 00:14.575
You can't ever show your
face around here again.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.712
I was trying to save you.

00:20.383 --> 00:21.415
Rápido!

00:21.417 --> 00:23.350
Eat your plum, Eli.

00:23.352 --> 00:26.153
Sometimes it's better to
get bitten than to starve.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.700
_

00:34.156 --> 00:35.325
_

00:35.328 --> 00:37.696
Tell me more about our rich jackass.

00:37.698 --> 00:39.431
- Billy Philpott.
- Mm-hmm.

00:39.433 --> 00:41.734
He's got his fingers in every
oil company in the state.

00:41.736 --> 00:45.204
Sun, Gulf, Magnolia, Humble.

00:45.206 --> 00:47.473
- What's his daddy do?
- Lawyer.

00:47.475 --> 00:50.542
I hate lawyers. I hate this shit.

00:50.544 --> 00:52.932
I hate losing the ranch even more.

00:52.935 --> 00:54.768
Don't look at me like that.

00:54.771 --> 00:57.255
You want to take over the
books, you just let me know.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.917
I spend all day fighting off people

00:58.919 --> 01:00.619
trying to collect money we don't have.

01:00.621 --> 01:02.244
So you need to go in there
and sweet talk Mr. Philpott

01:02.246 --> 01:03.655
like he's a piece of tenderloin

01:03.657 --> 01:05.057
you're trying to climb on top of.

01:05.059 --> 01:06.892
Mm-hmm. What's his angle?

01:06.894 --> 01:08.394
Fancies himself a renegade.

01:08.396 --> 01:09.766
Renegade, huh?

01:09.769 --> 01:12.107
What does that mean? His
socks don't match his skivvies?

01:12.110 --> 01:14.900
- Daddy..
- Or what, he likes to hide in the closet

01:14.902 --> 01:17.569
while his own buckaroo
gives it to his wife?

01:17.571 --> 01:19.638
Attaboy, get it all out.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.940
- Goddamn it.
- I got it.

01:45.499 --> 01:48.333
- Phineas.
- Fred.

01:50.838 --> 01:52.671
And you must be Colonel McCullough.

01:52.673 --> 01:55.140
- Fred Bernhauer.
- Eli is fine.

01:55.142 --> 01:58.677
You don't have to call me
Colonel until you piss me off.

01:58.679 --> 02:01.713
Mr. Philpott can't wait
to meet you. Such an honor.

02:01.715 --> 02:04.783
Well, the pleasure's all mine. All mine.

02:10.205 --> 02:12.406
You should be more careful, son.

02:15.675 --> 02:17.896
Now your average Comanche...

02:17.898 --> 02:20.732
He had a mind like an encyclopedia.

02:20.734 --> 02:24.203
He could tell you the name of
every plant in the Southwest,

02:24.205 --> 02:26.805
along with its various efficacies.

02:26.807 --> 02:29.007
He could look at the track of an animal

02:29.009 --> 02:30.809
and know everything about him.

02:30.811 --> 02:33.241
Young, old, fat, skinny.

02:33.244 --> 02:35.311
Hell, he could look at your track

02:35.314 --> 02:37.848
and tell if you've had cancer.

02:37.850 --> 02:40.717
Well, you know, uh,

02:40.719 --> 02:43.153
the dark races have always
been gifted that way.

02:43.155 --> 02:45.055
Hell, I got a Mexican,

02:45.057 --> 02:47.724
has a nose for quail
you would not believe.

02:49.662 --> 02:52.696
I can only imagine.

02:52.698 --> 02:54.231
So, what do you think, Fred?

02:54.233 --> 02:57.367
Did you ever dream that
you'd be breaking bread

02:57.369 --> 03:00.103
with the First Son of Texas?

03:01.149 --> 03:04.141
- It is a privilege.
- Yes, it is.

03:04.144 --> 03:06.143
Oh, Mr. Philpott, you
should show him the...

03:06.146 --> 03:06.943
No, no, no, Fred.

03:06.945 --> 03:09.279
I'm sure the Colonel
doesn't want to see that.

03:09.281 --> 03:10.614
Well, now you got us curious.

03:10.616 --> 03:14.084
Yeah, let's have it now, Billy.

03:14.086 --> 03:16.887
- Well, I'll tell you, if you insist.
- We insist.

03:16.889 --> 03:18.355
All right, here it is.

03:18.357 --> 03:21.892
I was told that Quanah Parker himself

03:21.894 --> 03:24.394
shot this into some poor settler.

03:24.396 --> 03:26.391
Poor man's widow pulled
it right out of him.

03:26.394 --> 03:27.994
Now generally speaking,

03:27.997 --> 03:30.767
the Comanche use steel arrowheads.

03:30.769 --> 03:35.806
Old Quanah himself, he
favored Colts and Winchesters.

03:35.808 --> 03:39.242
Well, I-I-I have it from a good source.

03:39.244 --> 03:40.911
Oh, I don't doubt it.

03:40.913 --> 03:44.114
It certainly is unusual.

03:44.116 --> 03:45.749
It was the first obsidian arrowhead

03:45.751 --> 03:47.150
I've ever seen in these parts.

03:47.152 --> 03:49.052
Might be worth something, Billy.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.221
Hell, Colonel, you don't
have to kiss my ass.

03:51.223 --> 03:54.595
I, uh, I'm man enough to
admit when I've been hustled.

03:54.598 --> 03:56.363
Shall we get down to business?

03:56.366 --> 03:58.199
Now that you got us all lubricated.

03:58.202 --> 04:01.303
All right, let's have at it.

04:01.306 --> 04:05.135
Well, now...

04:05.137 --> 04:08.605
while I admire your personal
achievements, Colonel,

04:08.607 --> 04:10.640
I did some sniffing around myself

04:10.642 --> 04:12.645
before our meeting today.

04:12.648 --> 04:14.248
And I must tell you,

04:14.250 --> 04:17.985
I do not admire the state
of your finances. Fred?

04:17.987 --> 04:20.821
In fact, I hear that you
all lost a drilling rig

04:20.822 --> 04:23.257
to a greaser attack just the other day.

04:23.259 --> 04:26.193
Not to mention the fact
that it doesn't appear

04:26.195 --> 04:28.829
that south Texas has much by way of oil.

04:28.831 --> 04:32.099
Now, if your ranch was
on the coastal plane,

04:32.101 --> 04:33.967
now, that'd be different.

04:33.969 --> 04:38.305
Well, our neck of the woods
is virgin potential, Billy.

04:38.307 --> 04:41.048
I wager if someone's
gonna buy into that valley,

04:41.051 --> 04:42.584
they're gonna make a lot of money,

04:42.587 --> 04:44.278
and I'd like it to be you and me.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.648
Well, now, Colonel,
you can't eat a wager.

04:47.650 --> 04:50.146
I'm real sorry, but only a fool

04:50.149 --> 04:52.820
would sink money into the
Rio Grande Valley right now.

04:52.822 --> 04:55.522
I've heard you're a bit
of a renegade, Billy.

04:55.524 --> 04:59.059
Is that true? Are you a renegade or not?

05:00.963 --> 05:03.297
Not when it comes to
losing money, I ain't.

05:03.299 --> 05:06.500
Like I said, sorry.

05:06.502 --> 05:08.335
Mr. Philpott, I'm a
little confused here.

05:08.337 --> 05:10.337
If you knew in advance
you weren't interested,

05:10.339 --> 05:12.039
then why did you agree to the meeting?

05:12.041 --> 05:14.405
We drove 10 hours to get up here.

05:14.408 --> 05:17.342
Well, heck,

05:17.344 --> 05:19.311
I just wanted to meet the Colonel.

05:31.425 --> 05:33.358
What the... Oh!

05:35.262 --> 05:36.762
Daddy, no! Dad!

05:42.002 --> 05:43.634
_

05:43.635 --> 05:46.570
_

05:49.610 --> 05:51.877
Let me buy you two lunch.

05:51.879 --> 05:54.112
Prime rib is a specialty of the house,

05:54.114 --> 05:57.098
which I recommend served rare.

05:57.101 --> 05:58.762
And I hope you brought your appetite,

05:58.765 --> 06:01.753
because you are not gonna
wanna miss that pecan pie.

06:51.838 --> 06:53.838
Jeannie?

06:53.840 --> 06:56.641
I've been looking for you everywhere.

06:56.643 --> 06:59.644
I've been here.

07:03.183 --> 07:05.617
Come on.

07:05.619 --> 07:09.187
What happens when someone dies?

07:09.189 --> 07:11.289
What?

07:11.292 --> 07:14.177
What happens when someone dies?

07:16.835 --> 07:19.102
If they're good, they go to Heaven.

07:19.104 --> 07:21.471
Who knows if they're good?

07:21.473 --> 07:24.400
God does. Come on.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.436
Are we good?

07:26.438 --> 07:29.272
Of course we are.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.241
We're McCulloughs.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.243
Let's go. You got chores to do.

08:04.955 --> 08:06.421
What are you reading?

08:11.031 --> 08:13.116
Oh, that's a good one.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.484
Thanks.

08:16.522 --> 08:17.988
Can we talk?

08:17.990 --> 08:20.457
Okay, sure.

08:20.459 --> 08:23.727
Should we... walk somewhere?

08:23.729 --> 08:25.462
Okay.

08:38.644 --> 08:40.309
What's on your mind?

08:43.015 --> 08:47.184
My brother-in-law went missing.

08:47.186 --> 08:49.753
Cesar.

08:49.755 --> 08:50.995
I remember him.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.078
He went out the night of
your father's birthday party

08:53.081 --> 08:55.492
and never came home.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.060
I'm very sorry.

08:57.062 --> 08:59.096
My sister is a wreck.

08:59.098 --> 09:01.998
If something bad did happen,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.805
she needs to mourn properly and move on.

09:08.207 --> 09:10.273
So you haven't heard anything?

09:11.844 --> 09:14.711
- No.
- Are you certain?

09:14.713 --> 09:16.780
I don't think much happens around here

09:16.782 --> 09:18.849
without your family knowing about it.

09:18.851 --> 09:21.718
That night, we were all pretty occupied

09:21.720 --> 09:24.554
tending with the damage
to our rig, and all.

09:27.693 --> 09:30.794
Well...

09:30.796 --> 09:33.296
I thought at least I would ask.

09:34.733 --> 09:37.901
- If you hear anything...
- I'll tell you, I promise.

09:46.645 --> 09:48.311
I know you don't want to hear this...

09:48.313 --> 09:50.313
I'm not selling land to
the goddamned Midkiffs.

09:50.315 --> 09:52.616
- It's just eight sections.
- Nothing, not one section.

09:52.618 --> 09:55.152
Well, then the bank
forecloses on the ranch.

09:55.154 --> 09:56.820
If someone sets foot on my property,

09:56.822 --> 09:58.822
I'm gonna blow their
freakin' heads right off.

09:58.824 --> 10:00.624
They're not gonna need to
set foot on the property.

10:00.626 --> 10:03.760
They'll just take it in the courts.

10:03.762 --> 10:05.980
- See you later.
- Where you goin'?

10:05.983 --> 10:07.664
I got somewhere to be!

10:07.666 --> 10:10.066
- You want me to drive you?
- No.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.046
Hey, I'm sorry.

10:11.049 --> 10:14.471
I had no idea Philpott
was gonna do that.

10:14.473 --> 10:16.740
We'll find another investor.

10:20.612 --> 10:23.146
Want to get a drink?

10:23.148 --> 10:24.948
Someplace private?

10:24.950 --> 10:27.517
Sounds good.

10:27.519 --> 10:29.152
Hup, hup!

10:31.190 --> 10:32.455
Hup!

10:33.792 --> 10:35.158
Come on!

10:39.998 --> 10:41.331
Yah! Hup, hup!

10:42.668 --> 10:45.435
Papá! Papá!

10:45.437 --> 10:47.804
- ¿Dónde está Papá?
- No sé. ¿Por qué?

10:47.806 --> 10:49.272
Papá!

10:55.547 --> 10:57.314
Señor Pizaña.

10:57.316 --> 10:59.149
Aniceto Pizaña?

10:59.151 --> 11:00.450
A friend of Cesar's.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.620
Señor Pizaña! Welcome.

11:03.622 --> 11:07.324
Ana. It's good to see you.

11:07.326 --> 11:09.793
And you must be Maria.

11:12.164 --> 11:14.564
You have your mother's eyes.

11:14.566 --> 11:16.032
Thank you, Señor.

11:16.034 --> 11:18.201
Aniceto.

11:20.906 --> 11:23.006
It's nice to see you safe.

11:23.008 --> 11:24.332
Ignacio, see to s horses

11:24.335 --> 11:26.575
- and leave his men something to eat.
- Sí, Papá.

11:26.578 --> 11:29.045
Señor Pizaña, have you seen Cesar?

11:29.047 --> 11:31.381
- He's been missing for days.
- Ana.

11:31.383 --> 11:33.049
Give the man some breathing room.

11:33.051 --> 11:35.018
He's come a long way.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.687
Why don't we talk in my office?

11:37.689 --> 11:39.089
Ladies.

11:46.867 --> 11:50.625
_

11:51.794 --> 11:53.546

11:54.444 --> 11:58.335

12:13.816 --> 12:15.485

12:16.069 --> 12:17.737

12:44.555 --> 12:48.216

12:48.295 --> 12:50.353

12:50.770 --> 12:52.605

12:54.565 --> 12:59.729

12:59.946 --> 13:04.075

13:04.742 --> 13:07.996

13:08.538 --> 13:14.419

13:51.560 --> 13:54.125
_

13:59.088 --> 14:00.092
_

14:04.331 --> 14:07.165
You save any turtle for me, fat boy?

14:07.167 --> 14:08.533
Come on.

14:08.535 --> 14:09.834
_

14:09.836 --> 14:12.437
This is Escute.

14:12.439 --> 14:14.706
You probably seen him around.

14:14.708 --> 14:17.308
He's gonna show you some of our ways.

14:38.798 --> 14:41.232
The warrior's called Wohonuu makwiyetu.

14:41.234 --> 14:43.301
English, "Charges the Enemy."

14:43.303 --> 14:45.737
Probably seen him, too.

14:45.739 --> 14:47.505
Can I try that?

14:47.507 --> 14:50.508
Don't talk so much.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.877
_

15:10.230 --> 15:12.997
Aah!

15:24.744 --> 15:26.717
_

15:26.884 --> 15:28.469
_

15:46.433 --> 15:48.032
Ah!

15:55.108 --> 15:58.443
_

16:13.326 --> 16:16.094
_

16:50.695 --> 16:52.970
_

16:53.179 --> 16:55.681
_

16:55.811 --> 16:58.645
_

17:00.102 --> 17:01.854
_

17:01.896 --> 17:04.232
_

17:05.191 --> 17:07.234
_

17:07.234 --> 17:09.237
_

17:10.445 --> 17:16.618
_

17:17.411 --> 17:20.455
_

17:20.531 --> 17:22.491
_

17:22.493 --> 17:23.242
No.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.628
_

17:26.963 --> 17:29.966
_

17:31.050 --> 17:35.404
_

17:36.180 --> 17:38.641
_

17:38.766 --> 17:40.977
_

17:41.143 --> 17:44.188
_

17:45.439 --> 17:46.524
_

17:47.900 --> 17:49.902
_

17:50.653 --> 17:55.992
_

17:56.200 --> 17:58.703
_

17:59.787 --> 18:02.331
_

18:03.874 --> 18:05.626
_

18:07.044 --> 18:08.129
_

18:13.158 --> 18:14.510
_

18:15.052 --> 18:16.846
_

18:18.055 --> 18:19.807
_

18:28.065 --> 18:31.485
_

18:35.573 --> 18:37.450
_

19:27.287 --> 19:30.621
I don't remember inviting you.

19:34.427 --> 19:36.160
You want me to leave?

19:40.533 --> 19:43.768
How's old Tom? Working?

19:43.770 --> 19:46.604
My husband works every day.

19:46.606 --> 19:49.874
He's not a rich old kaheeka like you.

19:51.544 --> 19:53.945
_

20:41.728 --> 20:43.431
You're not as old as you look.

20:57.190 --> 20:58.668
Hey.

20:58.731 --> 21:00.925
Hey.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.327
Come here.

21:04.164 --> 21:05.497
Come here.

21:10.904 --> 21:13.505
Are you all right?

21:15.375 --> 21:18.009
It seems we haven't talked in a while.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.612
I'm fine.

21:20.614 --> 21:22.947
Well, I'm not.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.953
The kids...

21:28.955 --> 21:30.422
Hush.

21:32.454 --> 21:34.854
I need a talking-to.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.093
Can I ask you a question?

22:08.095 --> 22:10.662
Okay.

22:10.664 --> 22:13.998
Is there something going on?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.234
Something that I don't know about?

22:16.236 --> 22:19.304
N-not that I can think of.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.076
I saw what I could have sworn was blood

22:25.078 --> 22:26.911
out in the old blacksmith's shed.

22:29.616 --> 22:32.784
So?

22:32.786 --> 22:37.589
That seems a strange
place for butcherin'.

22:37.591 --> 22:39.691
What were you doing in there?

22:39.693 --> 22:42.594
Following Jeannie.

22:42.596 --> 22:44.362
She was lurking around the way she does

22:44.364 --> 22:46.664
and asking strange questions.

22:48.135 --> 22:50.301
Pete.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.106
Hey. Hey!

22:55.108 --> 22:56.641
Stop it. What...

22:56.643 --> 22:58.943
You start talking about
blood and butchering.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.613
Who wants to hear that?
You ruined the mood.

23:01.615 --> 23:03.181
What aren't you telling me?

23:35.132 --> 23:37.098
You're gettin' started early.

23:39.688 --> 23:41.187
Sit down, Tom.

24:06.046 --> 24:09.914
How many you think we
got buried out there?

24:09.916 --> 24:12.116
I don't know.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.785
Don't wanna know.

24:20.594 --> 24:22.293
So how many you got?

24:24.197 --> 24:26.130
Fewer than the Colonel.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.466
How many he got?

24:28.468 --> 24:30.702
I doubt he even knows.

24:36.710 --> 24:39.043
Let me ask you, Pete.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.878
What's your number?

24:40.880 --> 24:43.866
Two I'm sure of.

24:45.845 --> 24:48.694
Not to mention all the stuff
he brought me along for.

24:51.291 --> 24:54.592
You ever put a slug in a
man who wasn't hurting you?

24:54.594 --> 24:56.928
No.

24:56.930 --> 25:00.665
Then by the likes of someone like me,

25:00.667 --> 25:03.001
you've had it pretty easy.

25:09.943 --> 25:11.476
You ever think about the families

25:11.478 --> 25:13.845
of the men you put down?

25:13.847 --> 25:15.313
No.

25:21.788 --> 25:26.491
We're born into a
certain time and place,

25:26.493 --> 25:28.960
and there ain't nothing
we can do about it.

25:33.873 --> 25:36.707
I think we all got a choice, Tom.

25:45.178 --> 25:46.611
Where you goin'?

25:53.320 --> 25:55.019
Where you goin'?

25:58.158 --> 26:00.158
- Pete.
- No.

26:00.160 --> 26:02.527
No, Sully.

26:02.529 --> 26:03.961
Come on, Pete.

26:07.363 --> 26:09.096
Look, if you want to drive somewhere,

26:09.099 --> 26:11.502
I'd be happy... I'd
be happy to drive you.

26:41.165 --> 26:44.166
_

27:27.651 --> 27:30.818
- What's the point of this lesson?
- This will be easy.

27:30.820 --> 27:33.054
Stand here while they shoot at you.

27:33.056 --> 27:35.294
Training arrows, no spikes.

27:35.297 --> 27:37.128
Isn't likely they'll kill you.

27:37.131 --> 27:40.762
- So you want me to stand here?
- Yeah.

27:40.764 --> 27:42.764
Try and use the shield.

27:45.168 --> 27:47.001
Where are you going?

27:47.003 --> 27:48.836
I don't want to get shot.

28:10.551 --> 28:13.451
Watch the arrows! Keep your eye on them!

28:33.540 --> 28:36.174
Good. Good.

28:44.685 --> 28:46.518
That arrow had a broadhead in it!

28:46.520 --> 28:49.054
_

28:53.393 --> 28:55.360
Aah!

28:59.266 --> 29:02.901
_

29:23.924 --> 29:25.857
I'm gonna kill him.

29:25.859 --> 29:29.227
Nah, you were 100 paces
away. He was testing you.

29:29.229 --> 29:31.363
Stupid to go after him.

29:31.365 --> 29:32.696
He shot a broadhead at me.

29:32.699 --> 29:35.233
- You expect me just to forget about that?
- That's right.

29:35.235 --> 29:36.935
What about honor?

29:36.937 --> 29:38.436
Attacking a man you cannot defeat

29:38.438 --> 29:40.705
comes from pride, not honor.

29:40.707 --> 29:43.642
Pride is often the opposite of honor.

29:43.644 --> 29:45.477
You're not a Comanche yet.

29:45.479 --> 29:46.945
One day you might be,

29:46.947 --> 29:48.947
but for now, you're my property.

29:48.949 --> 29:51.193
You're no different
from one of my horses.

29:51.196 --> 29:54.152
If someone hurts you, you're
not allowed to fight back.

29:54.154 --> 29:56.888
It's my job to protect you.

29:56.890 --> 29:58.623
You understand?

30:01.868 --> 30:03.735
When will I be a Comanche?

30:18.412 --> 30:20.779
Did you receive satisfaction?

30:23.150 --> 30:25.150
Since when do you care?

30:25.152 --> 30:27.152
Mm.

30:33.884 --> 30:36.018
- Mmm, this is nice.
- Mm.

30:39.299 --> 30:42.167
Slow down. It will go to your head.

30:44.771 --> 30:47.005
That's whal'm hoping for.

30:47.007 --> 30:49.274
Mm.

30:54.314 --> 30:58.016
So what's the trouble this time?

30:58.018 --> 31:00.485
What makes you think
that I have trouble?

31:00.487 --> 31:03.354
Because you're here.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.683
I might have to sell the ranch.

31:12.099 --> 31:14.365
So move somewhere else.

31:17.137 --> 31:20.305
There's nowhere to go.

31:20.307 --> 31:23.842
Used to be, just got on
your horse and rode on.

31:23.844 --> 31:26.778
Now there's nothing but
people everywhere you go.

31:26.780 --> 31:30.381
I remember the past less fondly.

31:35.396 --> 31:37.763
I feel like I'm getting old.

31:40.961 --> 31:42.660
You've been old for a long time.

31:42.663 --> 31:45.163
I mean in my head.

31:45.165 --> 31:48.700
This...

31:48.702 --> 31:51.870
I don't care about.

31:51.872 --> 31:54.205
My boys want me to sell
off part of the ranch,

31:54.207 --> 31:56.875
but I got a bad feeling about that.

31:58.578 --> 32:02.147
Once you slice one little piece off,

32:02.149 --> 32:04.382
then it's another
piece and another piece

32:04.384 --> 32:06.417
until there's nothing left.

32:09.322 --> 32:11.890
Are you talking about the ranch

32:11.892 --> 32:13.658
or your pride?

32:13.660 --> 32:16.728
Oh, hell, Ingrid.

32:16.730 --> 32:20.765
Sulking doesn't look good on
you, so come on out with it.

32:20.767 --> 32:23.368
You're very old,

32:23.370 --> 32:26.938
and your children don't appreciate you.

32:29.609 --> 32:31.609
Hmm.

32:31.611 --> 32:35.847
When you're gone...

32:35.849 --> 32:39.250
you ever wonder what
you'll leave behind?

32:39.252 --> 32:42.253
Dust.

32:42.255 --> 32:44.389
I ain't got much else.

32:47.794 --> 32:51.196
I've been a lot of
bad things in my time.

32:53.567 --> 32:58.469
Accrued my fair number of
black marks against my soul.

33:01.408 --> 33:03.875
What was it all for?

33:07.747 --> 33:09.280
You know...

33:11.585 --> 33:15.286
I remember when everything you owned

33:15.288 --> 33:17.422
would fit in your pocket.

33:17.424 --> 33:18.756
Hmm.

33:18.758 --> 33:20.258
You were happy.

33:25.398 --> 33:27.899
Are you hungry?

33:27.901 --> 33:29.500
No.

33:32.939 --> 33:35.506
You look hungry.

33:35.508 --> 33:37.008
I'm okay.

34:00.467 --> 34:01.799
Hmm.

34:07.388 --> 34:09.522
Oh! Aah!

34:17.366 --> 34:18.831
You gettin' up?

34:27.309 --> 34:29.208
You ever think about us?

34:29.210 --> 34:31.678
- Every day.
- Still?

34:31.679 --> 34:34.214
Yes.

34:34.216 --> 34:37.484
I wish I could live your
life, just for a day or two.

34:37.485 --> 34:39.485
Oh!

34:39.487 --> 34:40.954
It's that bad, huh?

34:40.956 --> 34:43.489
Everyone lives in cages.

34:43.492 --> 34:45.225
And you?

34:45.226 --> 34:46.993
Especially me.

34:49.101 --> 34:51.467
So we were the last of the free?

34:53.168 --> 34:54.467
Yep.

34:56.487 --> 34:59.255
It was over after Palo Duro.

35:01.376 --> 35:03.676
An entire empire

35:03.678 --> 35:06.019
starved,

35:06.022 --> 35:09.815
sickened... and beaten.

35:09.818 --> 35:12.852
Consigned to dust.

35:12.854 --> 35:15.588
You have your time, it passes.

35:15.590 --> 35:18.991
Something new gets built.

35:18.994 --> 35:22.730
Yeah, well, there was a time,
I thought I'd live forever.

35:22.733 --> 35:25.732
Lately, I been wondering

35:25.734 --> 35:28.268
what's gonna happen after I'm gone.

35:28.270 --> 35:30.670
Ahh.

35:30.672 --> 35:33.106
This isn't about your family.

35:33.108 --> 35:34.538
You want to be remembered.

35:34.541 --> 35:36.943
Of course I do.

35:36.945 --> 35:39.379
Look at you.

35:39.381 --> 35:42.949
You gave up everything
to protect your tribe,

35:42.951 --> 35:46.453
but you died an early age,

35:46.455 --> 35:48.388
and now you're forgotten.

35:51.293 --> 35:53.793
But you remembered me.

35:53.795 --> 35:55.361
That's something.

35:55.364 --> 35:59.566
People can tell stories and sing
songs about your many victories.

35:59.568 --> 36:02.035
Won't make your children any happier.

36:02.037 --> 36:04.604
Other things carry more value.

36:18.232 --> 36:19.665
Hey.

36:19.667 --> 36:21.901
Some cold fried chicken for you there.

36:24.439 --> 36:26.739
Obliged.

36:26.741 --> 36:29.742
Used to be, I'd see you more
than once or twice a year.

36:29.744 --> 36:32.979
Well, I can make an effort.

36:32.981 --> 36:35.348
You won't.

36:37.285 --> 36:39.452
I got a family.

36:42.690 --> 36:44.857
Speaking of which...

36:44.859 --> 36:47.760
Old Tom will be home around sundown.

36:47.762 --> 36:49.962
I'll eat faster.

37:07.783 --> 37:09.817
Are you happy?

37:16.958 --> 37:18.858
Take care of yourself.

37:42.417 --> 37:43.916
ándale.

37:46.154 --> 37:48.154
Vamos. Vamos.

37:48.691 --> 37:51.190
_

37:52.312 --> 37:54.272
_

37:55.082 --> 37:56.792
_

37:56.941 --> 37:59.736
_

38:00.445 --> 38:02.947
_

38:04.324 --> 38:06.579
_

38:06.657 --> 38:09.662
_

38:10.548 --> 38:14.001
_

38:14.375 --> 38:16.127
_

38:18.379 --> 38:20.215
_

38:20.423 --> 38:21.674
_

38:23.551 --> 38:25.178
_

38:25.261 --> 38:27.692
_

38:27.695 --> 38:31.797
Whatever happens, whatever he does,

38:31.799 --> 38:34.266
it'll be because of us.

38:35.855 --> 38:40.193
_

38:41.444 --> 38:43.571
_

38:44.405 --> 38:46.032
_

38:49.383 --> 38:51.083
_

39:02.730 --> 39:05.131
Ahh.

39:08.269 --> 39:10.102
Where were you all day?

39:10.104 --> 39:11.804
Busy.

39:13.728 --> 39:15.695
You know I worry, don't you?

39:17.578 --> 39:21.981
Well, you can stop worrying.

39:24.685 --> 39:27.319
Call Midkiff.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.955
See what you can get
for those eight sections.

39:29.957 --> 39:32.758
You won't regret this, Daddy.
