WEBVTT

00:06.406 --> 00:08.108
Thanks for hosting.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.877
How was the sleepover?

00:09.943 --> 00:13.046
They each had a 5‐Hour Energy
drink and a jar of Nutella

00:13.113 --> 00:16.250
and then watched Russian
dashcam videos all night.

<i>Vodit' znachit ubivat'!</i>

00:18.619 --> 00:20.053
Listen, Marge.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.090
Every year, Kirk and I rent
a luxury villa in Costa Rica

00:23.156 --> 00:26.727
and invite a few select families
to join us. (chuckles)

00:26.793 --> 00:28.762
Maybe you've heard about it?

00:28.829 --> 00:31.965

Um... (smacking lips)

00:40.641 --> 00:42.943

00:43.010 --> 00:43.977
Nope, nope.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.146

00:46.213 --> 00:48.515
Sorry, it's news to me.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.450
We were wondering,
would your family

00:50.517 --> 00:52.019
be interested in joining us?

00:52.085 --> 00:53.954
When would you need
an answer by?

00:54.021 --> 00:55.722
Oh, the sooner the better.

01:03.830 --> 01:04.798

01:17.210 --> 01:18.245
Mwah!

01:18.312 --> 01:19.980
The Van Houtens invited <i>us</i>

01:20.047 --> 01:22.983

multi‐family vacation

01:23.050 --> 01:24.818

01:24.885 --> 01:27.854
We'll stay in a luxury villa
right on the beach...

01:27.921 --> 01:28.956
Whoo‐hoo!

01:29.022 --> 01:31.058
...near pristine rain forests,

01:31.124 --> 01:34.127
home to five percent
of the species on Earth...

01:34.194 --> 01:35.963
Biodiversity!

01:36.029 --> 01:39.866
...in a land where it's normal
for kids to carry machetes.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.168
Legalize it!

01:41.234 --> 01:44.071
And <i>you</i> can chew
on the guidebook.

01:44.137 --> 01:46.907
I've always dreamed
of being the kind of family

01:46.974 --> 01:50.010
that other families would be
willing to do things with.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.079
BART AND LISA (chanting):
Costa Rica!

01:52.145 --> 01:54.214
‐Costa Rica!
‐Airport food court!

01:54.281 --> 01:56.750
‐Airport food court!
‐Costa Rica!

01:59.620 --> 02:00.887
Whoa.

02:00.954 --> 02:05.125
Now, that's a tympanic membrane
that just won't quit.

02:06.526 --> 02:09.129
HOMER: Whoa.
This trip's gonna cost how much?

02:09.196 --> 02:10.697
MARGE:
I know it's expensive,

02:10.764 --> 02:13.467
but we spend our whole lives
worrying about money.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.869
That's because we
don't have that much.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.038
We have a mortgage,
a reverse mortgage.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.407
I think the house is owned
by the car.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.909
Life is about experiences.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.146
Look at this photo the Hibberts
posted from last year's trip.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.148
Now look at <i>my</i> feed.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.916
Yeah.

02:29.983 --> 02:30.951
Oh, boy.

02:31.018 --> 02:34.688
I want a photo of you and me
by that waterfall.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.924
The hope of going on this trip
is the only reason

02:37.991 --> 02:41.094
I've allowed Bart
to stay friends with Milhouse.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.097
Now I understand everything.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.099
MARGE:
Homie, I know it's a stretch,

02:46.166 --> 02:48.602
but if Kirk and Luann
can afford it...

02:48.669 --> 02:50.771
Yeah. He can't earn that much.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.140
His job is moving
the Topless Maids van

02:53.206 --> 02:54.941
so they don't get
parking tickets.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.945
Let's have one damn fling and
hope everything will be okay.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.981
You know what?
You are right.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.016
I am sick of being
the responsible one

03:03.083 --> 03:04.518
in this marriage.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.053
Let's live life.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.921
Remember, we can never be poor

03:07.988 --> 03:10.457
as long as we have each other.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.525
(both sigh)

03:11.591 --> 03:14.194

Oh... yes, we can.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.766
You know, what if we stayed home

03:19.833 --> 03:21.802
and just did puzzles
of Costa Rica?

03:21.868 --> 03:25.405
I mean, this trip sounds
really expensive.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.774
‐No, not really.
‐What? No!

03:27.841 --> 03:32.045
You just let the grown‐ups worry
about grown‐up things, okay?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.980
(chuckles)
Your mom and dad

03:34.047 --> 03:37.651

03:50.063 --> 03:52.032
The Van Houtens, of course.
The Hibberts.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.868
Superintendent Chalmers
and his daughter.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.003
I can't believe
my father is tearing us apart

03:57.070 --> 03:58.872
for a whole week.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.540
Sweetie,
it's a very long flight.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.442
Why don't you save
your phone battery.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.611
All you care about is batteries!

04:04.678 --> 04:06.613
You've never been in love.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.648
Your mother and I had a very...

an extended period of time with.

04:15.322 --> 04:18.925

so I'll do it on the plane.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.432
Well, Lou the cop and his sister
were gonna go,

04:25.499 --> 04:27.033

04:27.100 --> 04:29.603
and her wind chime store
burned down.

04:29.669 --> 04:32.639
So I suggested Patty
and her new girlfriend.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.441
You deliberately hid this
from me

04:34.508 --> 04:36.476

Or as she would say,

09:43.183 --> 09:45.251
"further away
than a fat‐cheeked boy

09:45.318 --> 09:47.921
from a porch full of grannies."

09:47.987 --> 09:49.456
(giggles)

09:49.522 --> 09:51.691
Run, fat boy, run!

09:51.758 --> 09:53.560
(grunting)

09:54.727 --> 09:56.996
(anxious panting)

09:58.164 --> 09:59.332
Why are you freaking out?

09:59.399 --> 10:00.667
Shouldn't you be in the jungle

10:00.733 --> 10:02.702
kissing a boa constrictor
or something?

10:02.769 --> 10:05.371
This trip is so expensive,
and Mom and Dad don't care,

10:05.438 --> 10:07.807
so I'm practicing sleeping
in a car

10:07.874 --> 10:10.877
for when we lose the house
and have to sleep in our car!

10:10.944 --> 10:13.012
Well, Milhouse's dad writes down
how much money everyone owes

10:13.079 --> 10:15.982
in that book,
so all we have to do is snag it,

10:16.049 --> 10:17.717
then show Mom and Dad
the numbers.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.287
Yes! That'll snap 'em
out of their financial insanity.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.724
You up for a little
breaking and entering?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.993
Break into a grown‐up's bedroom?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.895
Whoa, big move.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.364
Okay, we'll do it
when everyone's on the hike.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.700
But how do we get rid
of Milhouse?

10:33.766 --> 10:35.935
Not a problem.
Milhouse already ditched me

10:36.002 --> 10:37.237
for Dr. Hibbert's kid.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.939
His "vacation friend."

10:40.006 --> 10:43.243
Hey, JJ, do you still
like Legos?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.879
‐Uh... not really.
‐Me neither.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.648
Lego sucks! (grunts)

10:48.715 --> 10:52.585
Hey, JJ, why don't we put on a
play for the grown‐ups tonight?

10:52.652 --> 10:56.156
Ooh, sweetie, look,
a "Flowers of Costa Rica"

10:56.222 --> 10:59.759
scavenger hunt. I wonder
how many we can find together?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.828
Just braid, Daddy!

11:01.895 --> 11:04.931
I need to look super hot
to win back Jimbo's heart.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.900
(sighs)
Darling, you're experiencing

11:06.966 --> 11:09.335
so many emotions
for the first time.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.271
And that's very healthy, but...

11:11.337 --> 11:14.140
He strayed because of you!

11:15.608 --> 11:18.978
Hey, JJ, one time my friend got
a temporary tattoo

11:19.045 --> 11:21.981
but told his dad it was real.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.317
Okay, let's steal that ledger.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.652
What's that thing?

11:25.718 --> 11:27.820
Grappling hook made
of Patty's underwire bra

11:27.887 --> 11:29.622
and Dad's
bathing suit drawstring.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.057
Will it reach?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.025
(grunts)

11:36.796 --> 11:38.198
(clicks)

11:40.133 --> 11:44.237
This is so weird, being in
another grown‐up's bedroom.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.641
Boy, you're telling me.
He doesn't even work out.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.478
Uh, I don't want to learn
anything else about this family.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.980
It's too late.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.115
(both shuddering)

11:57.550 --> 11:59.452
All right, bottled water break.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.087
I can drink from the stream.

12:01.154 --> 12:05.225
After all these years,
my gut biome is <i>simpatico</i>

12:05.291 --> 12:07.026
with the local bacteria.

12:09.062 --> 12:13.333
Ugh! Oh, God, there's something
moving inside me!

12:13.399 --> 12:15.602
Oh, look out!
Oh, look out!

12:15.668 --> 12:17.937
Look out, I said look out!
Look out!

12:18.004 --> 12:22.475
Oh, God, no <i>simpatico!</i>
No <i>simpatico!</i>

12:22.542 --> 12:25.712
Hey, Homer.
You want a hit off this?

12:25.778 --> 12:29.649
Oh, Evelyn. You and I both love
secret day drinking,

12:29.716 --> 12:31.951
but I promised Marge
I'd have a bad time

12:32.018 --> 12:33.453
the rest of this vacation.

12:33.519 --> 12:37.523
I hear exactly
what you're saying.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.127
Mm‐hmm?
Mmm.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.398
‐(gasps)
‐Did you find the ledger?

12:45.465 --> 12:48.635
No, but take a look at this.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.703
These are stone spheres

12:50.770 --> 12:54.240
made by the extinct
Diquis people of Costa Rica.

12:54.307 --> 12:58.111
No one knows what they were for,
but they're priceless artifacts.

12:58.177 --> 13:01.547
So what is Milhouse's
loser dad doing with them?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.449
‐(lock clicks)
‐(both gasp)

13:03.516 --> 13:05.485
(Kirk groans)

13:05.551 --> 13:07.887
Oh, I'm sorry, Kirk's tum‐tum.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.155
(groans)

13:09.222 --> 13:10.690
Daddy drank some ick‐ick.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.492
(Kirk groans)

13:12.558 --> 13:14.060
Oh, the rumblies are coming.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.062
The rumblies are coming!

13:16.129 --> 13:18.364
‐They're here!
‐(Bart grunts)

13:18.431 --> 13:20.066
(Kirk groans)

13:20.133 --> 13:22.468
If we get this photo right,

13:22.535 --> 13:25.872
this multi‐family vacation
will be worth every penny.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.840
(Homer giggles)

13:27.907 --> 13:29.909
You're so cute
when you're super controlling.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.444
‐(Marge sniffs)
‐(phone camera clicks)

13:31.511 --> 13:33.179
You've been drinking.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.181
(slurring):
Well, maybe Evelyn added

13:35.248 --> 13:37.917
a little Southern charm
to my water.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.953
That woman!
She brings out the worst in you!

13:41.020 --> 13:42.922
Look!

13:42.989 --> 13:44.190
MARGE:
Oh, my God.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.725
It's perfect.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.593
You look good,
and I look better.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.362
Post it. Post it.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.197
EVELYN:
Homer!

13:51.264 --> 13:55.134
Buddy, hi. Watch me do
a Savannah Polecat Flip.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.036
(whoops, grunts)

13:58.204 --> 14:00.106
No!

14:01.240 --> 14:02.875
Come back, camera fish!

14:02.942 --> 14:05.111
(grunting)
Oh!

14:06.145 --> 14:07.613
(grunts)

14:07.680 --> 14:09.716
(Homer groaning frantically)

14:09.782 --> 14:11.017
(Patty growls)

14:13.286 --> 14:17.090
All I wanted was for my friends
to be jealous of me.

14:17.156 --> 14:19.025
I hope you're happy

14:19.092 --> 14:21.861
now that that bald gorilla
has dragged my girlfriend down

14:21.928 --> 14:24.564
to his pathetic level.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.632
(snoring)

14:27.934 --> 14:29.569
Patricia Maleficent Bouvier,

14:29.635 --> 14:32.238
I've put up with you criticizing
my husband for years,

14:32.305 --> 14:33.806
and I've had it.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.375
Evelyn got Homer drunk.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.443
Evelyn ruined my dream photo.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.278
<i>She's</i> the bad influence.

14:39.345 --> 14:41.080
That's ridiculous.

14:41.147 --> 14:44.016
She may be Southern,
she may be a woman,

14:44.083 --> 14:46.619
but you're dating a Homer.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.589
(Evelyn and Homer snoring)

14:49.655 --> 14:52.024
Oh, no.

14:52.091 --> 14:55.361
Mom, look what I found
in the Van Houtens' room!

14:55.428 --> 14:59.332
They are smuggling
these artifacts home to sell!

14:59.399 --> 15:00.733
(all gasping)

15:00.800 --> 15:02.435
That's how they can afford
this vacation.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.070
But we can't.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.072
And we're gonna have
to live in our car,

15:06.139 --> 15:08.074
and the seats
in our car are sticky,

15:08.141 --> 15:10.109
even though they're cloth!

15:10.176 --> 15:13.246
(sobbing):
You're... you're so gross.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.248
It's so gross.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.984
Salt... and pepper.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.086
These souvenirs
were supposed to be

15:20.153 --> 15:23.256
our end‐of‐multi‐family‐vacation
gift to you all.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.391
Way to spoil the surprise.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.761
Not very <i>pura vida.</i>

15:28.828 --> 15:31.130
Not very <i>pura vida</i> at all.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.265
(Lisa and Marge grunt)

15:32.331 --> 15:34.700
<i>Stacy and I are finished.</i>

15:34.767 --> 15:36.869
<i>Shauna Chalmers,
will you marry me?</i>

15:36.936 --> 15:38.838
Oh, my God!

15:38.905 --> 15:40.306
Jimbo proposed!

15:40.373 --> 15:43.743
We are getting freaking married!

15:43.810 --> 15:45.244
(chattering)

15:49.882 --> 15:52.151
Oh, you guys
are slinking off early.

15:52.218 --> 15:55.755
Don't you want to come ziplining
and ruin the trip some more?

15:55.822 --> 15:57.490
Well, I would...

15:57.557 --> 16:00.660
like to agree with my wife
that it's better we leave.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.362
I'll give you the final bill now
so we can settle up.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.865
No discount for leaving early
either. (laughs)

16:05.932 --> 16:10.403
I may be <i>mucho pura vida,</i>
but, uh, I'm not a sucker.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.673
Lisa was right.

16:13.739 --> 16:15.842
We really couldn't afford
this trip.

16:18.377 --> 16:19.812
(breathing loudly)

16:19.879 --> 16:21.047
(whoops)

16:21.113 --> 16:22.682
Ooh, that's a big number.

16:22.748 --> 16:25.151
(guttural panting)

16:32.625 --> 16:33.559
(groans)

16:33.626 --> 16:35.261
How's Patty?
I haven't seen her.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.029
I don't know what happened.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.165
She... broke up with me.

16:40.766 --> 16:41.901
Yeesh.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.402
I know you feel bad, Mom,

16:43.469 --> 16:45.671
but the lady <i>is</i> a Homer.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.943
BOTH:
Mmm.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.112
Oh, all that money,

16:53.179 --> 16:55.114
and we didn't even get
the picture.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.149
(gasps)
Look at this.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.318
Mr. Van Houten even charged us

16:59.385 --> 17:01.988
for those salt
and pepper shakers.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.656
He said those were a gift.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.658
And he didn't even
give them to us.

17:05.725 --> 17:08.160
Then we're not leaving
without them.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.529
‐(Homer grunts)
‐(Bart yells)

17:09.595 --> 17:10.596
(thud)

17:15.301 --> 17:17.236
(all gasping)

17:17.303 --> 17:21.474
Oh, so that explains it.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.979
HOMER:
Gotcha.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.916
Can't you let us even zipline
in peace?

17:29.982 --> 17:33.119
Look what we found hidden
in your bedroom.

17:33.185 --> 17:37.089
This is a portrait of explorer
Kirkedemious Van Houten,

17:37.156 --> 17:40.593
who settled this area for
a Dutch cracker‐trading company,

17:40.660 --> 17:45.231
and he built this house,
which your family still owns.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.900
You're charging us thousands
of dollars in rent

17:47.967 --> 17:49.802
for a house you get for free.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.004
The Van Houtens
are cheating all of us,

17:52.071 --> 17:55.007
so <i>we</i> pay for <i>their</i> vacation.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.510
‐I'm stunned.
‐I'm shocked.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.011
I'm Shauna.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.981
I'm just as surprised
as any of you.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.083
Oh, what?!
Come on!

18:04.150 --> 18:06.118
This scam was her idea.

18:06.185 --> 18:09.055
And this year
she even charged you more

18:09.121 --> 18:11.457
so we could pay
for our "intimacy coach."

18:11.524 --> 18:14.327
I mean, how many things
can you do with a feather?

18:14.393 --> 18:15.795
Ooh.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.430
Oh, easy, guys, easy.

18:17.496 --> 18:21.067
Everyone try
to remain <i>pura vida.</i> Huh?

18:21.133 --> 18:23.002
I'm gonna <i>pura vida</i>
my foot in your ass

18:23.069 --> 18:24.971
if you don't
give me back my money.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.873
He's zipping away!

18:27.940 --> 18:31.010
Stop him
before he endorses those checks!

18:32.945 --> 18:34.880
So, you and Evelyn broke up?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.716
I thought you really liked her.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.353
I did, but now all I see
is Homer, thanks to you.

18:40.419 --> 18:43.055
Patty! Come back!

18:43.122 --> 18:46.959
I can't!
Because I'm on a zipline...

18:47.026 --> 18:48.527
Ooh.
(grunts)

18:48.594 --> 18:53.065
Patty, I'm sorry I upset you,
but Evelyn is your Homer,

18:53.132 --> 18:56.068
and no one else will ever
understand why you love her,

18:56.135 --> 18:57.536
except for you.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.272
But there's one huge difference
between them.

19:00.339 --> 19:01.941
(grunts)

19:02.008 --> 19:05.811
(Marge grunting)

19:05.878 --> 19:06.879
I'm listening.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.881
Evelyn loves you,

19:08.948 --> 19:12.618
and Homer hates you
more than anything in the world.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.320
Even more than he hates Selma?

19:14.387 --> 19:15.988
He feels sorry for Selma,

19:16.055 --> 19:18.324
because she has to live
with you.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.992
Hold on, Evelyn!

19:20.059 --> 19:22.595
I'm coming!

19:24.063 --> 19:25.498
Go ahead, take your money.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.800
Take away a man's
only source of income.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.902
No, it's real classy.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.304
We just got a free vacation.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.106
LISA, MARGE AND BART:
Hooray!

19:34.173 --> 19:37.376
Now let's charter a helicopter
back to the waterfall

19:37.443 --> 19:40.179
to get your mom's
precious picture.

19:40.246 --> 19:41.414
(groans)

19:41.480 --> 19:44.550
No, no, no. It's okay.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.086
Vacations aren't
about the perfect photo.

19:47.153 --> 19:50.923
It's about being in the moment
and living your... <i>vida.</i>

19:50.990 --> 19:52.958
Mwah!

19:53.025 --> 19:54.193
(both exclaiming happily)

19:54.260 --> 19:57.363
They're as cute
as two bugs in a rug.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.266
Aw.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.109
(laughs)

20:10.176 --> 20:11.811
Honey, I just want you to know

20:11.877 --> 20:13.913
that Jimbo Jones is
a fine young man,

20:13.979 --> 20:16.348
and I'm very happy
for you two to be married.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.584
‐Truly.
‐Yeah...

20:18.651 --> 20:21.353
Jimbo's parents freaked out
and canceled the wedding.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.089
Whatever.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.824
I'm glad
<i>somebody's</i> setting limits.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.325
You know, pumpkin,
I'm doing my best.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.827
Do you understand that?

20:27.893 --> 20:30.596
That as a single father,
it's not always so easy

20:30.663 --> 20:33.432
to balance guidance
with respect for your...

20:33.499 --> 20:37.103
Yeah...

20:37.169 --> 20:38.137
<i>ah...</i>

20:38.204 --> 20:41.907
<i>CHALMERS: Yeah, now
we're connecting, huh?</i>

20:50.716 --> 20:52.084
Why can't we just leave?

20:52.151 --> 20:54.420
'Cause we have to clean up
before Uncle Pete gets here,

20:54.487 --> 20:56.722
or we'll lose our week
next year.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.225

‐(screams)

21:02.161 --> 21:05.131
Hey, hey,
this stuff is expensive!

21:05.197 --> 21:07.166
<i>¿Comprende?</i>
(grunts)

21:10.736 --> 21:13.072
‐Uh‐oh. Uh‐oh.
‐(hooting)

21:13.139 --> 21:14.373
No, amigos, no, no.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.474
<i>No, pura vida!</i>

21:15.541 --> 21:16.475
<i>Pura vida!</i>

21:16.542 --> 21:19.478
Oh, no! <i>No bueno!</i>

21:29.121 --> 21:30.756
Shh!
