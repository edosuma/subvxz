00:30.248 --> 00:31.682
I couldn't tell you
if I wanted to.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.617
Only Bobby knows.
He planned the whole thing.

00:33.618 --> 00:35.019
Yup. There will be
dinner, drinks

00:35.020 --> 00:37.154
and entertainment.
Ooh!

00:37.189 --> 00:38.856
The big three! Ha-cha-cha-cha!

00:38.857 --> 00:41.592
And... we're home.

00:41.593 --> 00:43.127
Whoa, what's that?
The class pet.

00:43.128 --> 00:44.929
I'm taking care
of it this weekend.

00:44.930 --> 00:46.797
You're fine with it.
I'm... not.

00:46.798 --> 00:49.233
The permission slip I signed for
you says you're fine with it.

00:49.234 --> 00:50.434
You're into it.

00:50.435 --> 00:51.902
Ugh, what's wrong with it?

00:51.903 --> 00:53.470
Weird fur, seizures, runny nose,

00:53.471 --> 00:54.972
runny eyes, runny everything.

00:54.973 --> 00:56.974
Everybody's got their something.

00:56.975 --> 00:59.076
There wasn't anyone else
who wanted to take it?

00:59.077 --> 01:00.711
Just Wayne.
Who's Wayne?

01:00.712 --> 01:02.980
Kid in my class.
We had a tiny disagreement

01:02.981 --> 01:05.316
about who should take the
chinchilla home this weekend.

01:05.316 --> 01:08.085
No! No! No! No! No!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:08.086 --> 01:09.386
Well, congratulations, I guess.

01:09.387 --> 01:11.655
Just, um, keep it
out of our room.

01:11.656 --> 01:13.090
Yeah, yeah, okay, Dad.

01:13.124 --> 01:15.392
Aw, was your little
friend Wayne upset?

01:15.427 --> 01:17.228
Ah, no. He was easy breezy.

01:17.262 --> 01:19.263
Ah! Remember, bedtime is 7:00,

01:19.264 --> 01:21.799
not too much TV, no sugary
snacks, and pet with the grain.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.301
Pet with the grain!

01:24.302 --> 01:25.769
Okay, don't forget.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.571
Your father and I are
going out tonight,

01:27.572 --> 01:29.640
so you're gonna
babysit, Tina, right?

01:29.641 --> 01:30.941
About that. Um...

01:30.942 --> 01:32.643
I was talking
to some other girls,

01:32.644 --> 01:35.145
and did you know some people
get paid to babysit?

01:35.146 --> 01:36.914
Oh, boy, she's onto us.

01:36.915 --> 01:38.816
Okay, let's start
the negotiation.

01:38.817 --> 01:40.484
A thousand dollars
and a parking space.

01:40.485 --> 01:42.253
How about three dollars an hour?

01:42.254 --> 01:44.355
Okay, deal.
Three dollars every hour?

01:44.356 --> 01:46.190
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We get
a cut of this, right, Tina?

01:46.191 --> 01:47.191
Okay.

01:47.192 --> 01:48.592
But you all got to be in bed

01:48.593 --> 01:50.694
by the time we get home,
or nobody sees a dime.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.763
No problem... we can go
to bed in our sleep.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.265
: Ooh, Bobby!

01:54.266 --> 01:55.933
I'm excited to see
where you're taking me.

01:55.934 --> 01:57.835
Lin, you don't have
to cover your eyes.

01:57.836 --> 01:59.336
I never asked you to do that.

01:59.337 --> 02:00.771
I just want a big surprise.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.106
And surprises are better
when you're blind.

02:02.107 --> 02:03.140
Well, take a look.

02:03.141 --> 02:05.142
We're here! Huh?

02:05.176 --> 02:07.311
"Stoolz." It gets better.

02:07.312 --> 02:09.547
Bing-a-ding, bing-a-ding-
ding-ding-ding, brainiacs!

02:09.548 --> 02:11.615
This is your trivia master Dave
letting you know

02:11.616 --> 02:14.318
that we are less than one minute
away from trivia night!

02:14.319 --> 02:15.452
Trivia night?

02:15.453 --> 02:17.288
Ugh. When does it
get better, Bob?

02:17.289 --> 02:19.890
Well, that was supposed to be
the part where it got better.

02:19.891 --> 02:21.692
Y-You love trivia.
I do?

02:21.693 --> 02:23.561
We played bar trivia
that one time years ago.

02:23.562 --> 02:25.529
Remember?
Yeah?

02:25.530 --> 02:27.198
We had fun.
We did?

02:27.199 --> 02:28.365
I thought we did.

02:28.366 --> 02:30.034
We had a funny team name.

02:30.035 --> 02:31.702
We were Albert Beerstein.

02:31.703 --> 02:33.070
That's funny?
Yes, it's funny!

02:33.071 --> 02:34.983
It works on many levels, Lin!

02:35.006 --> 02:37.675
But, look, we can go
somewhere else if you want to.

02:37.676 --> 02:39.009
No, let's just get
through date night.

02:39.010 --> 02:40.044
Right.
Okay.

02:40.045 --> 02:41.078
Mm-hmm, great.
Fine.

02:41.079 --> 02:42.246
Yup, get a drink.
Yeah.

02:42.247 --> 02:43.647
Okay, trivia-meisters.

02:43.648 --> 02:45.349
Round one, question one.

02:45.350 --> 02:48.485
When I was 14,
I had a crush especial

02:48.486 --> 02:49.853
on Puerto Rican actress
Rosie Perez.

02:49.854 --> 02:52.056
Oh, we got this.

02:52.057 --> 02:53.757
It's gonna be
<i>White Men Can't Jump.</i>

02:53.758 --> 02:56.660
In what year did the United
States annex Puerto Rico?

02:56.661 --> 02:58.762
Oh. Um, it's, um... um...

02:58.763 --> 03:00.564
19... something, something.

03:00.565 --> 03:02.700
You know what? The first
question's always the hardest.

03:02.701 --> 03:04.768
All right, now that we got
the easy one out of the way...

03:04.769 --> 03:06.237
Oh, crap. I mean,
this will be fun.

03:06.238 --> 03:07.605
Yeah, it's fun, it's fun.

03:07.606 --> 03:10.441
It's like homework,
but-but fun homework.

03:10.442 --> 03:11.775
How many rounds are there?

03:11.776 --> 03:14.078
Not-not many, but many.

03:14.079 --> 03:16.213
<i>I just want you guys to know</i>

03:16.214 --> 03:17.915
that even though I'm your paid
babysitter tonight,

03:17.916 --> 03:20.050
I'm still your sister.
But I'm getting paid.

03:20.051 --> 03:22.119
No feet on the couch.
But I'm still your sister.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.187
For now.

03:23.188 --> 03:24.755
Until I get married off.

03:24.756 --> 03:26.423
All right,
so, when you're with me,

03:26.424 --> 03:28.092
you're not called
Princess Little Piddles.

03:28.093 --> 03:29.693
You are Shinobu.

03:29.694 --> 03:31.729
You like it? I know, it's great.

03:31.730 --> 03:33.197
This is Kuchi Kopi.

03:33.198 --> 03:34.565
You're both
little troublemakers.

03:34.566 --> 03:36.066
You're both huge in Japan.

03:36.067 --> 03:38.035
You probably have
a lot to talk about... go!

03:38.036 --> 03:40.104
Keep things light.
Don't bring up your divorce.

03:40.105 --> 03:41.539
Or Nixon. Or Radiohead.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.240
Belcher residence.

03:43.241 --> 03:45.209
Both my parents are home tonight
and they're black belts.

03:45.210 --> 03:46.277
Uh, it's for you, Louise.

03:46.278 --> 03:47.645
Really? Hello?

03:47.646 --> 03:49.113
Hey, Louise.
Wayne here.

03:49.114 --> 03:50.614
Uh, so how's Princess
Little Piddles?

03:50.615 --> 03:52.082
Fine. Great talk. Bye-bye. Wait!

03:52.083 --> 03:53.417
Put Princess on the phone.
What?

03:53.418 --> 03:55.419
Put Princess Little Piddles

03:55.420 --> 03:56.820
on the phone!
Why?

03:56.821 --> 03:58.222
Princess Little Piddles!

03:58.223 --> 03:59.924
Can you hear my voice?!
Are you okay?!

03:59.925 --> 04:01.825
Bye.

04:01.826 --> 04:03.627
I'll get it since I'm in charge.

04:03.628 --> 04:05.596
While I'm gone,
Gene's in charge.

04:05.597 --> 04:07.865
Louise, if Gene can't handle his
duties, it's all you, sister.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.134
I can handle my doodies,
thank you!

04:10.135 --> 04:11.735
I couldn't stop him!

04:11.736 --> 04:14.138
He barreled right past me
like a really fast barrel!

04:14.139 --> 04:17.141
Oh, my God, Wayne, you were
calling from outside my house?

04:17.142 --> 04:19.976
Out of cage! Out of cage!

04:20.011 --> 04:21.411
Okay, you're acting nuts, Wayne.

04:21.413 --> 04:24.014
Oh, you mean nuts
for responsibility?!

04:24.015 --> 04:26.183
Like nut, crazy,
bad, rotten nut!

04:26.184 --> 04:28.152
Responsible handsome
head nuts maybe?!

04:28.153 --> 04:30.154
No, no way! Just nuts!
No, handsome nuts!

04:30.155 --> 04:31.322
I know nuts!
No, like cashews!

04:31.356 --> 04:32.790
Um, excuse me!

04:32.791 --> 04:34.291
I hate to interrupt
a productive dialog,

04:34.292 --> 04:35.826
but where'd the chinchilla go?

04:35.827 --> 04:37.861
Uh,
he's around here somewhere.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.496
Stop screaming

04:39.497 --> 04:41.265
and help me look, Wayne!

04:41.299 --> 04:44.301
Why is the front door open?

04:44.302 --> 04:46.804
Maybe God closed a window?

04:46.805 --> 04:48.606
Chinchilla! Disgusting!

04:48.607 --> 04:50.174
Oh, no, no, no, no!

04:50.175 --> 04:51.775
Hey, mama!

04:53.111 --> 04:54.144
There he is!

04:55.614 --> 04:56.947
Oh.

04:56.948 --> 04:59.350
Hey, little, guy.
It's Jonas.

04:59.351 --> 05:00.517
Oh, good, he's
bringing him back.

05:00.518 --> 05:02.152
Jonas! Hey!

05:02.153 --> 05:04.455
You found our chinchilla!
Thank you!

05:04.456 --> 05:07.124
What? I can't hear you! Bye!

05:07.125 --> 05:08.692
No! No! No! No!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

05:08.727 --> 05:10.194
No!

05:10.195 --> 05:12.329
Oh, my God!
What just happened?!

05:12.330 --> 05:15.870
It ran away and joined the worst
biker gang in the world.

05:17.957 --> 05:20.024
Oh, Princess Little Piddles
has been abducted!

05:20.025 --> 05:21.626
This is all your fault, Louise!

05:21.627 --> 05:23.928
What?!
This is your fault, Wayne!

05:23.929 --> 05:26.598
You barged in to my house
and left the door open!

05:26.599 --> 05:28.199
I was barging!

05:28.200 --> 05:30.301
Bargers are not responsible
for closing the door!

05:30.302 --> 05:32.037
It's not a disaster.

05:32.038 --> 05:33.671
Jonas is the delivery boy
at Reggie's Deli.

05:33.672 --> 05:35.140
We'll just go to Reggie's.

05:35.141 --> 05:37.542
We shouldn't be out!
We should be back home!

05:37.543 --> 05:39.310
I'm not certified
for outdoor child care!

05:39.311 --> 05:41.146
Tina, we're under your care,
but this chinchilla is

05:41.147 --> 05:43.615
under my care, which technically
falls under your jurisdiction.

05:43.616 --> 05:45.950
Right?
I guess that's true.

05:45.951 --> 05:47.686
Or it might not make
any sense at all...

05:47.687 --> 05:49.554
Well, we'll be back home
in 20 minutes.

05:49.555 --> 05:51.489
All right, let's go to Reggie's.

05:51.490 --> 05:53.124
Aw, crap!
Reggie's is closed.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.193
Oh, now what?!

05:55.194 --> 05:57.028
We smash Reggie's window
and make some sandwiches

05:57.029 --> 05:58.196
and go from there.

05:58.197 --> 05:59.464
No, we go to where Reggie lives,

05:59.465 --> 06:01.199
and we ask him
where Jonas lives.

06:01.233 --> 06:02.367
You want to know
where Jonas lives?

06:02.368 --> 06:03.401
Well, take a number.

06:03.402 --> 06:04.936
Just kidding. Deli humor.

06:04.970 --> 06:06.204
Quit pussyfooting around!

06:06.205 --> 06:08.473
The address, Reggie!

06:08.507 --> 06:11.843
Uh, Jonas is at his friend
Clay's house doing homework.

06:11.844 --> 06:13.878
Clay is at Jonas's house
doing homework.

06:13.913 --> 06:15.647
What the...?
Isn't he?

06:15.681 --> 06:17.549
How can they both be
at each other's houses?

06:17.550 --> 06:19.551
Maybe they broke
the space-time continuum.

06:19.552 --> 06:21.486
Must've been some homework.

06:21.487 --> 06:24.222
Unless it's an excuse
teenagers tell their parents

06:24.223 --> 06:26.524
when they don't want them
to know where they're going.

06:26.525 --> 06:27.926
But where would that be?

06:27.927 --> 06:30.228
A secret teen event of secrecy?

06:30.229 --> 06:31.262
You mean a party?

06:31.263 --> 06:32.597
Yes! Tina, thank you!

06:32.598 --> 06:33.665
Is that Teddy?

06:33.699 --> 06:36.001
♪ I... ♪

06:36.002 --> 06:37.969
♪ Wish my radio worked. ♪

06:38.004 --> 06:39.838
Oh, no! If Teddy sees us
out of the house,

06:39.839 --> 06:42.540
he'll tell Mom and Dad.
Everyone hide!

06:46.512 --> 06:48.813
Huh?

06:48.848 --> 06:50.815
Oh, geez. Thought I saw Harvey.

06:50.850 --> 06:52.384
Ah, that was close. Listen.

06:52.385 --> 06:54.252
Why don't we go home,
make a decoy chinchilla

06:54.253 --> 06:56.187
out of pipe cleaners and socks
to buy ourselves some time?

06:56.188 --> 06:58.189
No, Tina, we're
looking for a party.

06:58.190 --> 06:59.791
What do you know
about high school parties?

06:59.792 --> 07:01.426
Nothing, but I might
know someone

07:01.427 --> 07:02.927
who might know something.

07:05.031 --> 07:07.032
What do you maxi-sads want?

07:07.066 --> 07:08.667
<i>Okay, after round one,</i>

07:08.701 --> 07:10.702
in first place are the DILFs.

07:10.703 --> 07:12.270
In second place, Old Kevin.

07:12.271 --> 07:14.239
And in last place,
with no correct answers,

07:14.240 --> 07:15.874
are the Date Nights
of the Round Table.

07:17.243 --> 07:19.377
Hey! First couple
ever here on a date!

07:19.378 --> 07:22.047
I guess the romance doesn't
revolve around knowing things,

07:22.048 --> 07:23.181
because they don't.

07:24.417 --> 07:27.052
Hey, hey!
Easy, Mr. Questions!

07:27.086 --> 07:28.386
Just kidding, just kidding.

07:28.387 --> 07:29.387
: I'm not kidding.

07:29.422 --> 07:30.455
They can't hear me.

07:30.456 --> 07:31.623
They don't know anything.

07:31.657 --> 07:32.957
Oh, my God, we're losing.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.125
And now we're getting heckled.

07:34.126 --> 07:35.627
I guess we can just go home.

07:35.628 --> 07:36.728
All right,
let's get out of here.

07:36.729 --> 07:38.396
Let me just go to the bathroom.

07:38.397 --> 07:39.964
Round two, question one.

07:39.965 --> 07:41.633
Hiking is stupid.
How many miles long is

07:41.667 --> 07:43.168
the Appalachian Trail?
I was hoping there'd be

07:43.169 --> 07:44.469
more questions about
'80s TV shows.

07:44.470 --> 07:45.837
Bob, I did something bad.

07:45.838 --> 07:47.539
In the bathroom?
No!

07:47.573 --> 07:49.474
Look! I stole an answer
sheet from Dave's folder!

07:49.508 --> 07:51.409
We got all the answers!
What?!

07:51.410 --> 07:53.445
Lin, are you crazy?
We can't cheat.

07:53.446 --> 07:55.780
Oh, yeah, we don't want
to cheat against Dave.

07:55.781 --> 07:57.315
He's such a good guy.

07:57.316 --> 07:58.783
Uh...
Write down the answer, Bob.

07:58.784 --> 08:00.118
Write it down!
Okay, okay.

08:00.119 --> 08:01.920
Not like that,
like you just thought of it.

08:01.921 --> 08:03.588
You look at the ceiling,
you say, "Hmm,"

08:03.589 --> 08:05.156
and then you look down.
Hmm.

08:05.157 --> 08:07.058
Yeah, yeah.
That's it, that's it.

08:07.093 --> 08:08.460
I might be able to find out

08:08.461 --> 08:10.662
which high school party
this Jonas kid is at,

08:10.696 --> 08:12.530
but why would I want
to help a bunch of babies

08:12.531 --> 08:13.832
get their cat back?

08:13.866 --> 08:15.800
It's not a cat,
it's a chinchilla!

08:15.835 --> 08:17.469
Anything that's not a dog
is a cat to me.

08:17.470 --> 08:19.804
We'll owe you. You name it.
Anything, anytime.

08:19.839 --> 08:22.040
What if I want Tina to kiss
a dirty flip-flop at 3:00 a.m.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.274
on a Tuesday?
Let's not go crazy...

08:23.275 --> 08:25.043
Of course. Yes. That.
No, no, no.

08:25.044 --> 08:27.345
I'm gonna think of something
good to make Tina do later

08:27.346 --> 08:29.080
when I'm feeling
really bad about myself.

08:29.115 --> 08:30.482
But we've got a deal.

08:30.483 --> 08:31.783
Whoa, that's a lot
of technology.

08:31.817 --> 08:33.784
We get it. You have e-mail.

08:33.818 --> 08:35.352
I'm using social media

08:35.354 --> 08:37.722
to triangulate
Jonas's whereabouts. Look.

08:37.722 --> 08:39.890
Jonas is friends with David
Schnabel, who just tweeted

08:39.892 --> 08:41.893
at Vanessa Jackson
"See you at Casey's party."

08:41.894 --> 08:43.561
And according to Leilani
LeFelt's secret blog

08:43.562 --> 08:45.063
she thinks no one knows about,

08:45.064 --> 08:46.965
Jonas has a huge crush
on Vanessa.

08:46.966 --> 08:49.567
So that means Jonas is
at Casey's party. Voila.

08:49.568 --> 08:51.569
All right, troops,
wheels up, we're flying!

08:51.570 --> 08:53.905
I-I don't think we can go to
a high school party, Louise.

08:53.906 --> 08:55.173
Mom and Dad will kill me.

08:55.174 --> 08:56.675
There'll be
high school boys there.

08:56.676 --> 08:58.410
Right. Maybe we can
just do a quick pop-in.

08:58.411 --> 09:00.211
Oh, wait, you think you're
gonna get into that party?

09:00.212 --> 09:02.380
Oh, you are never gonna get in.
I wouldn't even get in,

09:02.381 --> 09:04.449
and I'm the hottest girl
in eighth grade.

09:04.483 --> 09:06.685
You're in eighth grade? I
thought you were someone's mom.

09:06.719 --> 09:07.886
Trust me, Tammy.

09:07.887 --> 09:09.587
Getting in is gonna be
the easy part.

09:09.588 --> 09:11.389
I've gotten into the teacher's
lounge so many times

09:11.390 --> 09:13.091
I have my own coffee mug there.

09:13.092 --> 09:14.559
It says "I Hate Mondays."
Classic.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.494
Mm... I'm cashing in my favor.

09:16.495 --> 09:18.396
If you can get me into
that party, we're even.

09:18.397 --> 09:20.065
Let's go!
Every minute of our life

09:20.066 --> 09:22.334
is five minutes
of a chinchilla's life!

09:23.869 --> 09:26.237
Aha! Here's our ticket
into this poop show.

09:26.238 --> 09:27.706
How is trash gonna help us?

09:27.707 --> 09:30.041
Oh, Wayne. Watch and learn.

09:32.044 --> 09:34.746
Well, someone did.
What?

09:34.747 --> 09:36.681
Did you say, "We didn't
order any pizza"?

09:36.682 --> 09:39.017
No.
Well, someone did.

09:39.018 --> 09:40.719
And old man pizza boss is gonna

09:40.720 --> 09:42.520
have my ass if
I don't deliver it.

09:42.521 --> 09:43.922
Where's the bathroom?

09:43.923 --> 09:45.590
Uh, down that way.
Thanks.

09:45.591 --> 09:47.726
I'll be out of there
in 30 minutes or less.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.094
Hang on, Atlas.
We're coming, buddy.

09:49.095 --> 09:50.762
Who's Atlas?

09:50.763 --> 09:53.231
It's my secret name
for Princess Little Piddles.

09:53.232 --> 09:55.066
Really? Huh.
I call him Shinobu.

09:55.067 --> 09:57.268
Princess Little Piddles...
it just isn't right.

09:57.269 --> 10:00.138
I know. Fourth graders
shouldn't be in charge of names.

10:00.139 --> 10:01.573
Or sex determination.

10:01.574 --> 10:03.408
He has testicles for God's sake!

10:03.409 --> 10:05.577
I know! I told them,
"Guys, those are testicles!"

10:05.578 --> 10:06.978
No one believed me!

10:06.979 --> 10:08.780
Everyone thought
they were butt boobs!

10:09.882 --> 10:11.549
I can't believe that worked.

10:11.550 --> 10:13.051
Whew! Well done, Gene.

10:13.052 --> 10:15.387
Aw... are you going
to the bathroom?

10:15.388 --> 10:16.988
Um... no?

10:16.989 --> 10:18.584
Oh, my God!

10:19.790 --> 10:23.105
Oh, a high school party
is no place for a small animal!

10:23.106 --> 10:24.473
They're probably playing
Spin the Chinchilla

10:24.474 --> 10:25.608
with him right now!

10:25.609 --> 10:27.009
Uh, let's just focus here.

10:27.010 --> 10:28.477
If you were a teenager
with a chinchilla,

10:28.478 --> 10:29.512
where would you be?

10:29.513 --> 10:30.813
Chinchilla-con.

10:30.814 --> 10:32.648
So this is our first
high school party.

10:32.649 --> 10:34.450
Let's savor this moment.

10:34.451 --> 10:36.118
High school boys' butts are
higher up, I'm noticing.

10:36.119 --> 10:37.987
Okay, incoming teen dream,
two o'clock...

10:38.021 --> 10:40.256
if I'm using that term
correctly, which I don't know,

10:40.290 --> 10:42.525
because I actually can't
tell time on those round clocks.

10:42.526 --> 10:44.293
Ring the flirt alarm, here I go.

10:44.294 --> 10:47.330
Yeah, it's just like ding-dong,
ring-a-ding, let this rip.

10:47.331 --> 10:48.898
Hey, what grade are you guys in?

10:52.202 --> 10:53.469
Forget it. Bye.

10:53.470 --> 10:55.104
I can't feel my arms!
I can't move!

10:55.105 --> 10:57.106
Oh, God, he was
taller than my dad!

10:57.107 --> 10:58.641
Oh, God, another one's coming!

11:01.879 --> 11:03.880
On the Internet,
you can be whoever you want,

11:03.881 --> 11:05.615
and no one will ever know.

11:05.649 --> 11:07.817
Where does the word
"modem" come from?

11:07.818 --> 11:10.219
: Should we get this one
wrong? Just to not look suspicious?

11:10.220 --> 11:12.955
No. We know this one. We don't
know it... we're cheating.

11:12.956 --> 11:15.358
Well, now we know it, and we're
not getting it wrong. Okay.

11:15.359 --> 11:16.993
You know the answer, DILFs?

11:16.994 --> 11:18.995
Old Kevin? Because we do.

11:20.831 --> 11:21.998
Lin.
What?

11:21.999 --> 11:23.232
What is that?
It's a modem.

11:23.233 --> 11:24.400
I'm making modem noises at them.

11:24.401 --> 11:25.601
It-it's more like this.

11:30.374 --> 11:33.376
Okay, good modem noises,
Date Nights of the Round Table.

11:33.377 --> 11:34.710
Now back to the questions.

11:37.414 --> 11:38.681
Okay, okay!

11:38.682 --> 11:39.682
Tina.
What?

11:39.683 --> 11:41.317
I have to fart.

11:41.318 --> 11:43.519
It's a fear fart. I...
I can't hold it.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.188
Tammy, no! You can't fart
at a high school party.

11:45.189 --> 11:46.656
I know that!
Don't you think I know that?!

11:46.657 --> 11:48.257
Okay, I'm gonna fix this, honey.

11:48.258 --> 11:50.359
Can you hold it real tight
until I get you to a window?

11:50.360 --> 11:51.360
I'm gonna pick you up now.

11:51.361 --> 11:52.361
Gentle.

11:52.362 --> 11:53.362
Don't squeeze.

11:54.398 --> 11:55.865
Excuse us. Coming through.

11:55.866 --> 11:58.034
Just a couple of
normal teenagers partying.

11:58.068 --> 12:00.203
Hi. How are you?
How are you doing? Go, go.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.675
Tina, you literally
just saved my life.

12:05.676 --> 12:07.677
I am not gonna forget
this until the day I die.

12:07.678 --> 12:09.545
That's so...
Oh, my God, this girl farted!

12:09.546 --> 12:11.113
Right here, over here!
What?

12:11.114 --> 12:12.248
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

12:12.249 --> 12:13.249
Nobody's listening to us.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.084
Jonas... bingo.

12:15.118 --> 12:16.552
Whoa. Knock-knock.

12:16.553 --> 12:17.954
Who's there?
Uh, you guys.

12:17.955 --> 12:19.589
You guys who?

12:19.590 --> 12:21.691
That's right, you're not
supposed to be here.

12:21.725 --> 12:24.127
Give us the chinchilla,
Jonas. It's ours.

12:24.128 --> 12:26.662
It's the fourth-grade class pet,
for crying out loud.

12:26.697 --> 12:28.698
What? Oh, well, sorry,
I didn't know that.

12:28.699 --> 12:30.733
I thought he was a gremlin,
and I was like,

12:30.734 --> 12:32.435
"What? Gremlins are real?"

12:32.436 --> 12:33.870
Anyway, I gave him to Vanessa.
What?! What?!

12:33.871 --> 12:35.438
Where's Vanessa?

12:35.439 --> 12:37.406
She took it, went off
with some of her friends,

12:37.407 --> 12:40.243
and they were like, "Girls
only, except these three guys."

12:40.244 --> 12:42.145
Where did they go?

12:42.146 --> 12:44.147
I don't know. They were talking
about going roller-skating.

12:44.148 --> 12:45.148
Wherever you do that.

12:45.149 --> 12:46.582
The roller rink, maybe?

12:46.583 --> 12:47.784
Oh, yeah.

12:47.785 --> 12:49.218
Oh, I'm gonna slap you.

12:49.219 --> 12:50.219
What?

12:50.220 --> 12:51.621
Ow, my moneymaker!

12:51.622 --> 12:53.256
Here, let me see
that for a second.

12:53.257 --> 12:54.257
Ow!

12:54.258 --> 12:55.658
Oh, you found Jonas.

12:55.659 --> 12:56.659
Hi, Jonas.

12:56.660 --> 12:58.494
Hey...

12:58.495 --> 12:59.996
you, girl.

12:59.997 --> 13:01.764
Whew, I was afraid
you wouldn't remember me.

13:01.765 --> 13:03.166
Does this mean we got
the chinchilla back?

13:03.167 --> 13:05.001
Because Mom and Dad
could be home any minute.

13:05.002 --> 13:08.237
No. Jonas gave him away,
and now he's at a roller rink.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.641
Jonas, what does
Vanessa look like?

13:11.642 --> 13:14.076
I don't know. She
has hair and pants.

13:14.077 --> 13:16.479
Great description...
you should work for the FBI.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.681
Listen, you're coming with us
to point out who she is.

13:18.682 --> 13:19.916
Why would I do that?

13:19.917 --> 13:21.651
You guys belong together.

13:21.652 --> 13:23.853
You have the thing,
she has her thing.

13:23.854 --> 13:25.822
Yeah, it's the opposite
of "opposites attract."

13:25.823 --> 13:27.290
This is Jonas time.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.691
This is what
you've been training for.

13:28.692 --> 13:29.926
You got to go with us.

13:29.927 --> 13:31.461
Oh, my God. Let's go!

13:31.495 --> 13:32.929
I'm coming, Shinobu.

13:32.930 --> 13:34.430
I'm coming, Atlas.

13:34.431 --> 13:36.599
I'm coming, roller rink
snack bar hot dogs!

13:37.529 --> 13:40.820
All right, there's the rink.
Let's go get our chinchilla.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.122
Oh, God, you don't think

13:42.123 --> 13:43.623
they have strobe lights
in there, do you?

13:43.624 --> 13:44.724
Probably. Why?

13:44.725 --> 13:46.226
Strobe lights give him seizures.

13:46.227 --> 13:48.361
Oh, right, the strobe
light incident.

13:48.362 --> 13:51.364
Why did Alfonz bring a strobe
light to show and tell?

13:51.365 --> 13:53.366
Ugh, 'cause his
grandfather invented it.

13:53.367 --> 13:55.335
Oh, my God, is that Teddy again?

13:55.336 --> 13:58.705
Ugh, pad thai is not
good driving food.

13:58.739 --> 13:59.973
Uh, everyone freeze!

13:59.974 --> 14:01.374
Huh? Why are we freezing?

14:01.375 --> 14:02.842
If we don't move,
he can't see us.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.044
Is that true?
Maybe.

14:04.045 --> 14:05.211
Hold your breath!

14:05.212 --> 14:06.680
Oh, shoot, I just remembered

14:06.681 --> 14:07.681
I'm allergic to peanuts.

14:09.183 --> 14:10.417
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

14:11.419 --> 14:12.652
Oh, my God, it worked.

14:12.653 --> 14:14.087
Tina's a wizard.

14:14.088 --> 14:16.256
Do something else.
Make a jean jacket appear on me.

14:16.257 --> 14:17.223
Jean jacket!

14:18.659 --> 14:20.026
It's time for the final round.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.862
And incredibly, the seemingly
dimwitted Date Nighters have

14:22.897 --> 14:24.331
rocketed into first place.

14:24.332 --> 14:26.232
Yeah, Date Nighters!

14:26.233 --> 14:27.400
We're smart, and cute!

14:27.401 --> 14:28.401
Cuter than the DILFs!

14:28.402 --> 14:29.869
Yeah.

14:29.904 --> 14:31.738
All right, okay, settle down.
Question one:

14:31.739 --> 14:33.707
I've never been a carpenter
or on a boat,

14:33.708 --> 14:36.109
but Kurt Russell did both
in what 1987 movie?

14:36.110 --> 14:37.544
: Lin,
where's the answer sheet?

14:37.545 --> 14:39.946
Uh...  Oh, no, it fell.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.381
Oh, God, get it,
Lin. You're closer.

14:41.382 --> 14:42.749
Shh, I got it, I got it.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.851
Oops, I dropped some hummus.

14:44.852 --> 14:47.053
Hello, just getting
that hummus there.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.688
Okay.
We love hummus.

14:48.723 --> 14:50.023
Hey, what's that?

14:50.024 --> 14:51.524
What? That's an answer sheet.

14:51.559 --> 14:52.959
Nah.
Uh, yeah, definitely.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.627
No. No, no. You were cheating,
you're cheating.

14:54.628 --> 14:55.929
Cheaters!
No one's cheating.

14:55.930 --> 14:56.930
No.
Total cheaters!

14:56.931 --> 14:58.064
Full-on cheaters!

14:58.099 --> 14:59.532
Okay, you know what?

14:59.533 --> 15:00.934
We were cheating.

15:00.935 --> 15:02.569
I took my wife here on date.

15:02.570 --> 15:04.204
We have about three
of these a year.

15:04.205 --> 15:05.605
In a good year.

15:05.606 --> 15:06.973
And I brought her to bar trivia.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.642
I screwed up.

15:08.643 --> 15:10.644
And you didn't help, Dave.
You made us feel stupid,

15:10.645 --> 15:13.880
just because we didn't know the
answers to any of the questions.

15:13.881 --> 15:15.281
I know that was fun for Kevin.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.916
I know, I know.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.818
But my wife found a way to make

15:18.819 --> 15:20.387
this date night fun,
and, damn it,

15:20.388 --> 15:21.888
I'm not sorry about that.

15:21.922 --> 15:22.989
So sweet.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.691
You're out of here! Deborah!

15:24.725 --> 15:25.725
No, it...

15:25.726 --> 15:27.093
Hands off, Deborah.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.229
Hey! Ow!

15:29.263 --> 15:30.830
Wow, I'm sorry, Lin.

15:30.831 --> 15:32.666
That was, uh...

15:36.304 --> 15:38.138
...- worth it.
- Hot one.

15:38.139 --> 15:39.806
Next date night,
let's cheat at karaoke.

15:39.807 --> 15:41.808
<i>All right, Jonas,</i>

15:41.842 --> 15:42.842
where's Vanessa?

15:42.843 --> 15:43.843
Where's my chinchilla?

15:43.844 --> 15:45.245
<i>Our</i> chinchilla.

15:45.246 --> 15:47.247
Okay, Vanessa, love of my life.

15:47.248 --> 15:48.948
Let's see.
There she is!

15:50.751 --> 15:52.285
Let's go, let's go!

15:52.286 --> 15:54.487
Time to roll my way
into Vanessa's heart.

15:54.522 --> 15:56.323
Vanessa, where's the chinchilla?

15:56.324 --> 15:57.524
What?
Princess Little Piddles!

15:57.525 --> 15:58.525
What's "Piddles"?

15:58.526 --> 16:00.160
He's our class pet.

16:00.194 --> 16:02.462
Oh, I'm sorry, little kids,
but that security guard

16:02.463 --> 16:04.297
offered me 40 bucks for it.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.132
Oh, my God!
How could you?

16:06.133 --> 16:07.200
It was easy.

16:07.201 --> 16:08.702
He was like, "Here's $40."

16:08.703 --> 16:10.303
And I was like, "Here you go."

16:10.304 --> 16:11.671
Come on!

16:11.672 --> 16:13.106
Oh, Vanessa,
that kid Jonas likes you,

16:13.107 --> 16:14.507
and you should give
him a chance.

16:14.542 --> 16:17.010
Or not. Your call.
What? I can't hear you.

16:17.011 --> 16:18.511
The music's too loud.
I got to skate.

16:18.546 --> 16:20.180
Hey, Vanessa!

16:20.181 --> 16:21.181
Wait for me!

16:21.182 --> 16:22.816
Hey, sir?
Yeah.

16:22.817 --> 16:24.651
Can you push me towards
that girl over there?

16:24.652 --> 16:25.719
All right.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.020
He touched my butt.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.555
Excuse me, hi.

16:28.556 --> 16:30.390
That thing you paid
$40 for, it's ours.

16:30.391 --> 16:31.858
You guys smoke weed?

16:31.859 --> 16:34.961
No, the chinchilla
you paid $40 for.

16:34.962 --> 16:36.396
What? No, no, no.

16:36.397 --> 16:38.131
That's gonna be a present
for my landlord.

16:38.132 --> 16:39.966
I'm a little short
on rent this month.

16:39.967 --> 16:41.568
Why didn't you give him the $40?

16:41.569 --> 16:43.570
Hey, you're a smart kid.

16:43.571 --> 16:45.872
Where were you five minutes ago?
Over there.

16:45.873 --> 16:47.907
Sorry, buddy, but the chinchilla
already belongs

16:47.908 --> 16:50.043
to Miss Labonz's
fourth-grade class.

16:51.479 --> 16:53.346
I guess I have to do
the right thing.

16:53.347 --> 16:54.814
You have 40 bucks?

16:54.815 --> 16:57.017
We can write you a check.
Do you have a check?

16:57.051 --> 16:58.051
I do.

16:58.052 --> 16:59.486
Uh-oh.
What?

16:59.487 --> 17:01.388
Okay, if you were a chinchilla,

17:01.422 --> 17:03.823
and you were a rascally
little son of a bitch

17:03.824 --> 17:05.992
that wouldn't stay in a box,
where would you be?

17:05.992 --> 17:07.027
No!
Damn it!

17:07.060 --> 17:08.494
Here, Shinobu.
Here, thingy.

17:08.496 --> 17:10.096
Atlas, Atlas.
Here, thingy, thingy.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.531
Javier.
Shinobu.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.400
Where are you?
Oh, wait, is that him?

17:13.434 --> 17:15.035
Or is that a loose furry skate?

17:15.036 --> 17:16.970
Ah! He's gonna get
killed out there!

17:17.003 --> 17:18.003
Look out, coming through!

17:18.005 --> 17:19.005
Move it, people, move it!

17:24.612 --> 17:25.912
Huh?

17:25.945 --> 17:27.079
You know what that means.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.349
Time for The Whip!

17:42.196 --> 17:43.697
Hang on, Shinobu!

17:48.202 --> 17:49.469
I'll protect you, Atlas!

17:52.373 --> 17:53.340
You okay?

17:53.374 --> 17:54.441
I'm okay.

17:57.111 --> 17:58.845
Let's get out of here, quick.
Go, go, go!

17:58.879 --> 18:01.548
Uh-oh, we have
a vomit situation.

18:01.549 --> 18:04.951
Look out, skaters, the floor
gets slippery when wet.

18:05.953 --> 18:07.220
Vanessa!

18:07.221 --> 18:08.388
No!

18:08.389 --> 18:09.989
Oh, gross!

18:09.990 --> 18:10.991
Oh, God.

18:10.992 --> 18:12.892
I like her less now.

18:12.927 --> 18:14.294
<i>Please let Mom and Dad
not be home.</i>

18:14.295 --> 18:15.595
<i>Please let Mom
and Dad not be home.</i>

18:15.596 --> 18:16.930
Please let Mom and Dad
not be home.

18:16.931 --> 18:18.598
Mom? Dad?

18:18.599 --> 18:19.966
Oh, thank God, they're not home.

18:20.001 --> 18:21.334
Well, Wayne, we did it.

18:21.335 --> 18:22.635
Yeah, we did.

18:22.636 --> 18:24.270
You were great out there
on the rink.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.106
You came through, big-time.
You, too.

18:26.107 --> 18:28.308
So I'll hold Atlas while
you go collect his things.

18:28.309 --> 18:30.744
Oh, my God, after all we just
went through to get him back,

18:30.745 --> 18:31.945
you're still acting like this?

18:31.946 --> 18:33.346
You still want to take him home?

18:33.347 --> 18:35.248
Don't forget his water bottle.

18:35.249 --> 18:36.916
And, hurry, 'cause if he's
gonna get a story tonight,

18:36.917 --> 18:38.418
I have to get him home soon.

18:38.419 --> 18:40.186
You know what, why don't
we just let him choose

18:40.187 --> 18:41.688
who he wants to stay with?

18:41.689 --> 18:43.990
I've cared for him
every weekend for a year,

18:43.991 --> 18:46.026
so I think I know
who he's gonna pick.

18:46.027 --> 18:47.160
Perfect.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.862
You stand there,
I'll stand here,

18:48.863 --> 18:50.497
Put him down
in the middle, Tina.

18:50.498 --> 18:52.098
Okay. Come to Wayne, Atlas.
Come here.

18:52.133 --> 18:53.333
Shinobu.
Come on, come to Wayne.

18:53.367 --> 18:54.801
Come here, baby.

18:54.802 --> 18:55.835
Come on, Atlas. Atlas.

18:55.836 --> 18:57.203
Come here, come, come, come.

18:59.006 --> 19:00.006
Ah, yes!

19:00.007 --> 19:01.441
Take that, Wayne.

19:01.442 --> 19:03.043
He loves me, not you.

19:03.044 --> 19:04.978
He's sick of your boring rules!

19:04.979 --> 19:07.347
Okay, he's made his choice.

19:07.348 --> 19:08.782
Well, I guess I'll get going.

19:08.783 --> 19:10.850
Uh... have a good weekend.

19:10.851 --> 19:13.153
Uh, don't you want to say
good-bye to Shinobu?

19:13.154 --> 19:16.356
Oh, no, I'll...
I'll see you Monday.

19:16.390 --> 19:19.025
That didn't feel as great
as I thought it would.

19:19.026 --> 19:21.194
I mean, it still feels great,

19:21.228 --> 19:22.662
but just not as great.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.664
My theory is
that Wayne is really sad

19:24.665 --> 19:27.067
because you made him think
the chinchilla doesn't love him.

19:27.068 --> 19:29.069
Why don't we all go get
in bed really fast,

19:29.070 --> 19:31.571
and think about whether
Gene is right. Go, go, go!

19:31.572 --> 19:33.573
Hi. Why did some kid
just run out of here crying?

19:33.574 --> 19:35.709
There's always kids
running out of here crying.

19:35.710 --> 19:37.744
What are you still doing up?
Oh, hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

19:37.745 --> 19:38.878
We weren't out or anything.

19:38.879 --> 19:40.380
We were home all night.
Okay.

19:40.381 --> 19:42.215
You saying that makes
me think you maybe...

19:42.216 --> 19:43.416
Hey, you know what,
this one's on me.

19:43.417 --> 19:44.651
You don't even have to pay me.

19:44.652 --> 19:45.852
High school party? What?

19:45.853 --> 19:47.053
W-Wait, hold on a second.

19:47.054 --> 19:48.488
What's wrong with Louise?

19:48.489 --> 19:49.989
Louise, honey, you okay?

19:49.990 --> 19:52.559
I think I need a ride somewhere.

19:52.593 --> 19:53.893
Mm... no.

19:53.894 --> 19:55.495
What are you doing here?

19:55.496 --> 19:57.497
Hey, so after you left,

19:57.498 --> 20:00.100
Shinobu seemed real
down and kind of off.

20:00.101 --> 20:02.102
He wasn't sneezing or anything,

20:02.103 --> 20:03.670
like, not a single seizure.

20:03.671 --> 20:05.005
Really? Oh.

20:05.006 --> 20:06.906
Anyway, I guess maybe
he missed you.

20:06.941 --> 20:08.842
He did?
I just don't think

20:08.843 --> 20:10.744
he's gonna be happy
at our place.

20:10.745 --> 20:12.946
Plus, my dad's simple and
doesn't know his own strength.

20:12.947 --> 20:14.614
Oh, I can see that.
I mean, your dad

20:14.615 --> 20:15.915
looks like he'd sit on anything.

20:15.916 --> 20:16.916
Oh, he has.

20:16.917 --> 20:18.084
I'm right here.

20:18.085 --> 20:19.252
So you better just take him.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.321
I don't think he even likes me.

20:21.355 --> 20:23.590
: Stop it, play along.

20:23.624 --> 20:25.258
Tell me how it goes
on Monday, will you?

20:25.292 --> 20:26.393
Okay, thanks, bye.

20:26.427 --> 20:28.061
Bye.

20:28.062 --> 20:30.363
That was nice, Louise.
That was really, really sweet.

20:30.398 --> 20:34.839
Ugh, I know. You know, me and your
mom cheated at trivia tonight.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.808
Really?
Yup. Impressed?

20:36.809 --> 20:38.980
What's wrong with you?
You took her to trivia?

20:38.981 --> 20:41.708

out of a date. There's my girl.
