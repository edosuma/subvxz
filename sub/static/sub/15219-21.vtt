<i>[ Woman Narrating ]</i>
<i>Theorizing that one could</i>
<i>time travel within his own lifetime,</i>

00:04.027 --> 00:07.087
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett led an elite group</i>
<i>of scientists into the desert...</i>

00:07.163 --> 00:11.725
<i>to develop a top secret project</i>
<i>known as Quantum Leap.</i>

00:11.801 --> 00:14.235
<i>Pressured to prove his theories</i>
<i>or lose funding,</i>

00:14.304 --> 00:18.400
<i>Dr. Beckett prematurely stepped</i>
<i>into the project accelerator,</i>

00:18.475 --> 00:20.409
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:26.650 --> 00:28.982
<i>He awoke to find himself in the past,</i>

00:29.052 --> 00:34.319
<i>suffering from partial amnesia</i>
<i>and facing a mirror image</i>
<i>that was not his own.</i>

00:34.391 --> 00:37.656
<i>Fortunately, contact with</i>
<i>his own time was maintained...</i>

00:37.727 --> 00:40.753
<i>through brain wave transmissions</i>
<i>with Al, the project observer,</i>

00:40.830 --> 00:45.563
<i>who appeared in the form</i>
<i>of a hologram that only</i>
<i>Dr. Beckett can see and hear.</i>

00:45.635 --> 00:48.035
<i>Trapped in the past,</i>
<i>Dr. Beckett finds himself...</i>

<i>leaping from life to life,</i>

00:50.340 --> 00:52.035
<i>putting things right that</i>

Well--
And don't give me that
naive act, Phillip.

03:33.636 --> 03:36.196

Oh! Oh, about what?

03:39.909 --> 03:42.707
Well, uh--

03:42.779 --> 03:45.304
You could tell me--
That I'm still
in love with you.

03:45.381 --> 03:47.645
Huh! Well. I'm not!

03:47.717 --> 03:52.916
And how could I be? You just sail
out of my life one afternoon
to go and think!

03:52.989 --> 03:55.150
And three years later, I get
a letter from Bora-Bora...

03:55.225 --> 03:59.218
that said you were swept away

Well, I didn't buy it, Phillip.

Do you understand me?
I can see that.

04:06.669 --> 04:09.467
I'm going to marry Vincent tomorrow, and
there's nothing you could do to stop me.

You have one hell of a nerve,
showing up at Catherine's wedding.

05:04.761 --> 05:07.195
I'm-- I'm sure
it's just a coincidence.

05:07.263 --> 05:12.166
Coincidence? The same kind
of coincidence that got you two
married in the first place?

05:12.235 --> 05:17.537
That coincidence took
three years and a fortune
in psychiatrist's fees to undo.

05:17.607 --> 05:22.169
Maybe if we all would just kinda
come of the closet and talk about it.
[ Banging ]

05:22.245 --> 05:27.683
There's nothing to discuss, Dumont.
You closed that conversation
when you chose to run away,

05:27.750 --> 05:30.275
rather than work
for Farlington Nautical.

- [ Grunts ]
- I'm very sorry, Mr.-- Mr. Dumont.

05:57.981 --> 06:02.350
Miss Farlington refused
to accept these, so the concierge
suggested we bring them back to you.

06:02.418 --> 06:05.546
Coincidence, eh?
That's it, Dumont.

06:05.621 --> 06:09.387
Let's have it out, right now!
Mano a mano!

06:09.459 --> 06:11.393
That means, ''man to man,'' Sam.

06:11.461 --> 06:13.429
- Sir?
- I know what it means.

06:13.496 --> 06:17.489
- Then, get your dukes up!
- I really think that
there's been some mistake here.

06:17.567 --> 06:22.630
Not yet, but there's gonna be, if you--
Only if you try and stop Catherine
from marrying Vincent.

Vinnie the Viper?
I will <i>not</i> allow any...

to be slandered by the likes of you.

06:28.311 --> 06:32.771
Slandered? It's not slander, Sam.
This Vincent Loggia has a bad habit...

06:32.849 --> 06:34.840
of using people as cement additives.

06:34.917 --> 06:38.182
Mr. Dumont--
<i>Vincent Loggia may not be</i>
<i>as reputable as you may think.</i>

06:38.254 --> 06:43.624
<i>Why? Because he's willing</i>
<i>tojoin Farlington Nautical</i>
<i>and help pull it out of the red?</i>

06:43.693 --> 06:47.185
Something you were <i>unwilling</i>
to do?
These are extremely heavy, sir.

06:47.263 --> 06:49.629
Uh, tell him to take 'em back to her.
Take 'em back.

06:49.699 --> 06:51.633
I won't allow it!
Why not?

06:51.701 --> 06:54.226
It is unacceptable
for an engaged woman...

06:54.303 --> 06:56.703
to receive flowers
from her ex-husband.

06:56.773 --> 07:01.039

Well, all right.

And you, sir, if you would please
give Catherine my well-wishes...

07:15.591 --> 07:19.823

no threat to her marriage.

there's an

07:49.258 --> 07:51.192
Well, Ziggy's wrong.

07:51.260 --> 07:55.356
No. Phillip and Catherine
were crazy over each other.
They why did they get a divorce?

07:55.431 --> 08:00.095
When Phillip was marooned at sea,
Weathers Farlington IV,

08:00.169 --> 08:03.195
that pompous nozzle that
just walked out the door,

08:03.272 --> 08:05.331
convinced Catherine
that he was dead.

08:05.408 --> 08:08.707
- And he had the marriage annulled.
- <i>[ Knocking ]</i>

Uh, well, no. I was--
I was talkin' to myself.

09:00.763 --> 09:04.392
It's kind of a-- a bad habit

09:04.467 --> 09:07.664
Phillip?
Why are you here?

09:09.972 --> 09:12.031
Go ahead. Tell her.

09:12.108 --> 09:15.544
See? All right. Originally...

09:15.611 --> 09:19.547
Phillip was unable
to stop the wedding,
so he committed suicide.

09:19.615 --> 09:23.415
Catherine could never
get over it, so two years later,
she died of a broken heart.

09:23.486 --> 09:28.116
Please.
Oh, don't beg, Phillip.

09:28.191 --> 09:31.285

jump off the ship
and swim back to New York.

10:12.034 --> 10:14.229
Oh, come on, Al!

10:14.303 --> 10:18.569
People don't jump off a ship
for unrequited love.

10:18.641 --> 10:21.132
No, but for <i>true</i> love.

10:21.210 --> 10:23.576
''True love''?
Yeah.

10:23.646 --> 10:26.137
I mean, it only happens

how would I know?

10:31.220 --> 10:35.088
That's not fair. I'm sorry.
I'm sure, I mean, given
the sheer volume of attempts,

10:35.157 --> 10:38.388
that you had to luck out once.

10:38.461 --> 10:42.420
Yeah. All right. I had
good odds, and yes,
for one brief moment,

10:42.498 --> 10:44.966
- it happened to me.
- What, did you forget to get her number?

10:45.034 --> 10:48.595
- No, I got married.
- If she was so perfect,
why aren't you still married to her?

10:48.671 --> 10:52.198
That's not important.
What's important is that
you help these lovebirds.

10:52.275 --> 10:54.607
Okay! Fine.
Okay.

10:54.677 --> 10:58.169

What do you mean, Vinnie the--

11:00.249 --> 11:02.683

Look,just have Ziggy

Vinnie's underworld activities.

11:12.628 --> 11:14.994
I'll tell the Farlingtons.
They'll call of the wedding.

11:15.064 --> 11:17.464
I'll leap out,
Phillip will leap in,

11:17.533 --> 11:20.764
and he can win his own true love
back... by himself.

11:20.836 --> 11:22.770
No, no, no, no.

Absolutely!

11:55.705 --> 11:58.970
This must be Catherine's
little sister,Jennifer Elizabeth.

11:59.041 --> 12:02.306
Phillip, we've got one
tiny little problem.
What's that?

12:02.378 --> 12:05.040
I overheard Vinnie the Viper.
How'd you know his name?

12:05.114 --> 12:08.413
I made it up. I mean,
doesn't he look like
a snake to you?

12:08.484 --> 12:10.952
<i>Uh, uh, sort of.</i>
Anyway.

12:11.020 --> 12:14.217
He was talking to that henchman
he calls a ''best man,'' and he told him...

12:14.290 --> 12:17.418
if you step one foot near Kate--
That's short for Catherine.

12:17.493 --> 12:21.554
He's gonna chop you up into little,
tiny pieces and feed you to the fish.

12:25.468 --> 12:28.096
Uh-oh.

12:28.170 --> 12:30.695
Maybe it wasn't a suicide.

12:38.948 --> 12:42.748
<i>[ Sam ] Fish food. Vinnie wants</i>
<i>to turn me into fish food.</i>

12:42.818 --> 12:46.413
Vinnie's creepy, but I doubt
he's actually ever murdered anybody.

12:46.489 --> 12:49.083
No, he's never been
convicted of murder.

12:49.158 --> 12:51.217
But the state of New York
got him on three other felonies.

12:51.293 --> 12:53.227
Maybe this isn't really
such a good idea.

12:53.295 --> 12:56.958
- She <i>loves</i> you.
- If she loves me, why did she slap me?

12:57.032 --> 12:59.296
Sam, that means she loves you!

12:59.368 --> 13:02.428
<i>You're the only person who can</i>
<i>get her that impassioned.</i>

13:02.505 --> 13:06.407
<i>Before you,</i>

- Okay! O-- Okay.

Oh, Phillip.
I'm so glad you're here.

13:29.899 --> 13:31.799
Me too.

Now, listen. You, uh,
get to dinner, before

<i>[ Beeping ]</i>
<i>[ Al ] Ziggy says</i>
<i>there's a 96.2% chance...</i>

that you're here to get Vinnie
out of her life without ending yours.

13:54.457 --> 13:58.894
Why do I feel like Vinnie the Viper
is not going to appreciate that?

13:58.961 --> 14:02.362
<i>Good point. Uh, now</i>
<i>you have to look around...</i>

14:02.431 --> 14:05.832
and find a nice, romantic place.

14:05.901 --> 14:10.429
- Are you saying I have to
make her fall in love with me?
- She's already in love with you.

14:10.506 --> 14:13.373
But unless she thinks
you're still in love with her,

14:13.442 --> 14:15.774
she's not gonna trust you--
and if she doesn't trust you,

14:15.845 --> 14:19.542
then she's not gonna believe you

We gotta keep
our minds calm here.

42:01.375 --> 42:04.071
I don't want to keep calm
and get killed at the same time.

42:04.145 --> 42:08.309
Make your way over this way, here,
and see if you can grab this hook here.

42:09.416 --> 42:13.079
<i>All right, Sam? You gotta try</i>

<i>Hey, Sam! Right down by</i>

It looks like there's
an umbrella there.

- You better have a talk with your daughter.
- No, I don't think so, Vincent.

43:52.386 --> 43:56.186
If Catherine doesn't want
to marry you, I have no intention
of trying to change her mind.

43:56.257 --> 43:58.350
Oh, thank you, Daddy.

- Phillip--
- You stay away from him!

44:12.039 --> 44:14.803
He tried to... [ Pants ]
throw me out to sea
with the garbage,

44:14.875 --> 44:16.809
because she wouldn't
stay away from me.

44:16.877 --> 44:19.038
That guy's just nuts,
'cause I'm marryin' his ex-wife.

44:20.514 --> 44:22.812

kill him, I believe him.

I'm afraid I'll have to confine you

Oh, and get this, Sam.
You tell the story about
your sail to Bora-Bora...

45:15.336 --> 45:18.430
and Jenny writes it
as a murder mystery,

45:18.505 --> 45:20.564
and it becomes
a runaway best seller.

45:20.641 --> 45:23.007
And the two of you make enough money
to keep the family going...

45:23.077 --> 45:25.443

makes a comeback in the '7 0s.
