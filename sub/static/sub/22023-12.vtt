WEBVTT

00:03.180 --> 00:04.461
You guys, look.

00:04.462 --> 00:05.660
He's just saying...

00:05.994 --> 00:07.689
- Duh.
- Barely a rat.

00:08.045 --> 00:09.680
- Can I pet him?
- No.

00:09.706 --> 00:11.774
- Come on.
- You ask me that every year.

00:11.808 --> 00:13.542
One of these days,
I'm gonna wear you down.

00:13.577 --> 00:15.566
Your poor husband.

00:15.566 --> 00:18.229
Actually, um, no, we, uh,

00:18.230 --> 00:20.394
we got a divorce a few months ago.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.528
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.

00:21.564 --> 00:22.831
Oh, no, it's totally fine,

00:22.865 --> 00:25.467
I'm in a healthy
relationship with my DVR.

00:27.136 --> 00:28.603
Okay, this might be
a little bit out of left field,

00:28.637 --> 00:30.972
but, um, I know this
awesome steak house.

00:31.006 --> 00:33.541
Let me buy you dinner,
and then I can answer

00:33.576 --> 00:35.778
all of your groundhog-related questions?

00:37.046 --> 00:39.280
Um, oh, so, like,

00:39.315 --> 00:40.774
you and I, we would...

00:41.383 --> 00:43.516
we would go to the steak house and,

00:43.919 --> 00:46.521
like, eat the steak or maybe,

00:46.555 --> 00:49.691
like, order some sides
or something like that?

00:49.725 --> 00:51.726
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.461
Oh, my God, this is so hard to watch.

00:53.496 --> 00:54.562
I know.

00:54.597 --> 00:55.997
So, the thing is, like,

00:56.031 --> 00:59.868
I just got out of a really
long-term relationship...

00:59.902 --> 01:01.135
Oww!

01:01.170 --> 01:02.637
Watch it! Gary!

01:02.671 --> 01:04.072
Oww, he bit me.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.174
Oh, come on, come on,
little buddy, you okay?

01:06.208 --> 01:07.429
He's gonna be okay.

01:08.544 --> 01:10.751
Does that mean we go straight to summer?

01:12.543 --> 01:15.682

01:17.887 --> 01:20.822
<i>our groundhog meet and greet
has been cancelled.</i>

01:20.856 --> 01:22.924
But if you were coming here
to meet a rodent,

01:22.958 --> 01:25.861
your day was probably
not gonna be amazing anyway.

01:26.529 --> 01:28.663
Ugh, I mean, that poor groundhog.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.064
Look, I just got flustered.

01:30.099 --> 01:33.001
I'm not used to being flirted with.

01:33.035 --> 01:35.603
Well, at least you're
getting back out there.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.272
Oh, yeah? You're greasing
up the old gears?

01:37.306 --> 01:38.241
Hitting the road again?

01:38.242 --> 01:40.848
Seeing if that rusty hull
is still seaworthy?

01:41.143 --> 01:42.677
What vehicle is this?

01:43.081 --> 01:45.513
No, I'm not ready to start dating.

01:45.548 --> 01:46.174
You sure?

01:46.175 --> 01:49.450
I have, like, five cousins
who are very single.

01:49.485 --> 01:50.952
Well, thank you, but no.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.787
I am taking this time to focus on me.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.422
I bought a bunch of succulents,

01:54.456 --> 01:56.391
and also, I'm trying Sudoku.

01:56.425 --> 01:59.027
I feel like I missed that craze
the first time around.

01:59.061 --> 02:01.230
You are a very, very boring woman.

02:02.464 --> 02:04.098
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

02:04.133 --> 02:05.800
- Thanks for the Band-Aids.
- That's all right.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.268
That's the embryo

02:07.303 --> 02:09.537
right before they implanted
it in Dina's uterus.

02:09.572 --> 02:10.401
Isn't it cute?

02:10.401 --> 02:12.040
Yeah, I suppose it's cute,

02:12.074 --> 02:14.642
as far as amoeba-looking things can be.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.945
Well, I know it's just
a bunch of cells now,

02:16.979 --> 02:18.913
but if everything goes well,

02:18.948 --> 02:20.715
that's my and Jerusha's baby.

02:20.749 --> 02:21.783
Look, I don't wanna freak you out,

02:21.817 --> 02:22.951
but are you sure it's yours?

02:22.985 --> 02:25.333
'Cause it kinda looks like Elias.

02:25.921 --> 02:28.790
To be fair, all babies look like Elias.

02:28.824 --> 02:30.925
Hey, I need you to sign
this accident report.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.524
I'm gone for one morning,
and Amy spikes a groundhog.

02:33.525 --> 02:34.926
What are you doing here?

02:34.927 --> 02:37.825
The doctor said to spend
the rest of the day resting.

02:37.826 --> 02:39.558
I'm fine, I've never
missed a day of work before,

02:39.559 --> 02:40.482
and I'm not about to start

02:40.483 --> 02:42.470
because I had a few
boba balls shot up my runway.

02:42.504 --> 02:43.771
The miracle of life.

02:43.806 --> 02:45.640
Okay, no, I am taking you home.

02:45.674 --> 02:46.808
Come on.

02:46.842 --> 02:48.279
I'm not leaving the store.

02:49.345 --> 02:50.612
This is dumb.

02:50.646 --> 02:52.113
If I wanna relax, I fly to Ohio.

02:52.147 --> 02:53.414
I don't just sit and do nothing.

02:53.449 --> 02:54.193
Dina, please,

02:54.194 --> 02:55.817
if this implantation fails,

02:55.851 --> 02:57.969
I don't have enough money to try again.

02:58.681 --> 03:01.422
Fine, but I want it on
the record that this is stupid.

03:01.457 --> 03:03.057
Noted, and thank you.

03:03.559 --> 03:04.759
All right.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.320
You know, you might be surprised.

03:06.321 --> 03:08.763
A little fresh air and quiet
might be just the thing

03:08.797 --> 03:11.983
to, you know, put a smile
back on your face.

03:12.368 --> 03:13.084
Enjoy.

03:18.140 --> 03:19.974
I need you to give me that walkie.

03:20.009 --> 03:22.491
Excuse me. Jessica.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.881
So, word on the street is

03:26.915 --> 03:29.267
you are horny and looking for love.

03:29.752 --> 03:32.286
Uh, no, who said that?

03:32.321 --> 03:34.555
Let's just say a little dumb bird

03:34.590 --> 03:37.125
and her gay friend bird told me.

03:37.159 --> 03:39.293
Well, turns out
you have bad information.

03:39.328 --> 03:41.529
Shh, shh, look,
here's what we're gonna do.

03:41.563 --> 03:44.365
The second our shift ends,
we're going to my place,

03:44.400 --> 03:45.800
we're getting in my water bed,

03:45.834 --> 03:47.301
and we're not leaving till we figure out

03:47.336 --> 03:49.337
this whole will they, won't they,

03:49.371 --> 03:51.873
Kermit and Miss Piggy thing
we got going on.

03:51.907 --> 03:54.075
Wait, sorry, am I Kermit or...

03:54.109 --> 03:55.743
Yeah, 'cause you're
smart with skinny legs

03:55.778 --> 03:57.820
and I'm Miss Piggy because I'm a star.

03:58.148 --> 04:00.181
So, what do you think?

04:00.215 --> 04:01.883
I just think it might be weird

04:01.917 --> 04:04.752
to date someone I work with, so...

04:04.787 --> 04:08.156
Okay, fine, then screw it.

04:08.190 --> 04:11.159
- I will quit right now.
- No.

04:11.193 --> 04:13.327
- I no longer work here.
- No, no.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.096
I need someone to cover for Dina today.

04:16.130 --> 04:16.930
Any volunteers?

04:16.964 --> 04:18.833
- Well, I guess I could.
- Question.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.401
Is it possible to hook up an Xbox

04:20.435 --> 04:22.503
to the security monitors
in Dina's office?

04:22.538 --> 04:23.671
I suppose so, yeah.

04:23.706 --> 04:25.073
You know, Glenn,

04:25.107 --> 04:26.063
I've always had an
interest in management.

04:26.064 --> 04:28.009
- I'll cover for Dina.
- Great.

04:28.043 --> 04:29.777
Ooh, Glenn, if he's doing that,

04:29.812 --> 04:30.894
can I do the announcements?

04:30.895 --> 04:32.880
Well, Garrett's assistant manager now,

04:32.915 --> 04:34.129
so it's up to him.

04:34.130 --> 04:35.850
I once did a radio play in college.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.621
Okay, fine, just don't tell
me one more word about it.

04:39.388 --> 04:40.922
This is a good team.

04:42.725 --> 04:43.738
Come on.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.627
Relax.

04:47.930 --> 04:50.598
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax.

04:51.159 --> 04:52.574
Relax, damn it.

04:53.235 --> 04:54.120
Come on.

04:55.657 --> 04:56.496
Ugh.

04:59.441 --> 05:00.655
Nailed it.

05:02.411 --> 05:04.879
I... sorry, I mean,
I would help him myself,

05:04.913 --> 05:07.115
but he insisted on
speaking with a manager.

05:07.149 --> 05:09.817
Hi, I'm Amy, the floor manager.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.052
I'm Castor.

05:11.086 --> 05:12.516
You look really nice.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.566
Okay, how can I help you?

05:16.458 --> 05:19.727
Uh, Castor mentioned
that he works in insurance,

05:19.762 --> 05:22.063
which is a very stable industry.

05:22.097 --> 05:23.765
I used to work in textiles,

05:23.799 --> 05:25.767
but insurance was a dream of mine,

05:25.801 --> 05:27.668
so now I work in insurance.

05:27.703 --> 05:28.779
He took the leap.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.808
I'm sorry, do you two know each other?

05:33.842 --> 05:35.143
- No.
- Mateo's my cousin.

05:35.177 --> 05:35.858
Hmm.

05:36.678 --> 05:38.472
Cousin, in, like, you know,

05:38.473 --> 05:39.921
all Filipinos are related...

05:39.948 --> 05:41.304
Our mothers are sisters.

05:42.217 --> 05:42.862
Okay.

05:47.539 --> 05:50.621
- What is wrong with Castor?
- Uh, he's weird,

05:50.622 --> 05:52.088
I'm not attracted to him,

05:52.122 --> 05:53.790
and when you mentioned that
he "worked" in insurance,

05:53.824 --> 05:55.925
you could've mentioned
it was horse insurance.

05:55.960 --> 05:57.460
There's a lot of money in that.

05:57.494 --> 05:58.795
Horses' lives are crazy.

05:58.829 --> 06:00.463
I can handle my own
love life, thank you.

06:00.497 --> 06:04.100
Are you sure, 'cause you are
taking forever to smash it out.

06:04.134 --> 06:05.068
Again,

06:05.102 --> 06:08.638
I am not ready to start
dating, and if I were,

06:08.672 --> 06:10.607
why is that the cousin
you set me up with?

06:10.641 --> 06:11.808
How about the one who always comes in

06:11.842 --> 06:13.076
to buy his protein powder?

06:13.844 --> 06:15.812
You think you can land Rogelio?

06:15.846 --> 06:17.146
Straight girl, please.

06:17.181 --> 06:19.082
Cheyenne, back me up here.

06:19.116 --> 06:20.930
I mean, I am way

06:20.931 --> 06:22.352
out of Castor's league, right?

06:22.386 --> 06:25.088
Oh, for... oh, you?

06:25.122 --> 06:26.459
Right now? I...

06:27.291 --> 06:29.023
Castor seems good.

06:30.294 --> 06:32.362
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers.

06:32.396 --> 06:35.131
Sushi is on sale at the deli.

06:35.165 --> 06:38.720
Mmm, discount sushi
from a big box store.

06:38.860 --> 06:42.138
Why just eat when you can
gamble at the same time?

06:43.055 --> 06:45.046
You know what, that sounded
harsher than what I meant it to.

06:45.047 --> 06:47.252
If you like the sushi,
just get the sushi.

06:47.549 --> 06:48.480
Are you okay?

06:48.481 --> 06:50.356
Yeah, I just, I'm trying
to do it like Garrett,

06:50.357 --> 06:52.619
but I'm a little better,
I think, feeding off someone,

06:52.621 --> 06:54.195
you know, riffing in the moment.

06:54.196 --> 06:55.996
Yeah, sure, like a co-host,

06:56.273 --> 06:57.573
like, like, Kelly Ripa.

06:57.630 --> 06:58.979
Yes, or Hoda.

06:58.979 --> 07:00.246
Okay, all right...

07:02.582 --> 07:03.632
Then let's riff.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.887
Oh, all right. You ready?

07:05.888 --> 07:06.435
Yeah.

07:11.958 --> 07:13.592
Maybe we need to rehearse a little bit.

07:13.627 --> 07:14.548
Okay.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.616
No, I am at work.

07:16.617 --> 07:19.827
I'm getting paid to sit around
and play video games all day.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.729
Aww, sorry, Craig,
I forgot you got fired,

07:23.136 --> 07:25.271
Hey, Garrett,
can I leave a little early?

07:25.305 --> 07:27.306
I teach water aerobics
to seniors after work,

07:27.340 --> 07:28.972
and they yell at me if I'm late.

07:29.309 --> 07:30.386
It can get racist.

07:30.589 --> 07:31.902
They don't know what I am,

07:31.903 --> 07:33.679
so it's kind of all over the place.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.658
Kinda busy, I say you just do you.

07:36.149 --> 07:37.950
Really? Dina normally says that...

07:37.984 --> 07:39.654
Just do whatever you want.

07:42.301 --> 07:44.089
No, not you, Craig,
you need to go back to Staples

07:44.124 --> 07:45.429
and make things right.

07:45.825 --> 07:47.593
Amy, I'm gonna give you some

07:47.627 --> 07:48.895
gay man tough love right now.

07:48.896 --> 07:50.320
Okay? You ready?

07:50.931 --> 07:51.931
I wanna make sure you're ready.

07:51.965 --> 07:53.515
What, Mateo?

07:55.001 --> 07:56.477
Okay, no tea, no shade...

07:56.803 --> 07:58.619
you're not a ten right now.

07:58.838 --> 07:59.966
It's not about your looks.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.840
You just have some major dings.

08:01.875 --> 08:03.642
You're over 30, you're divorced,

08:03.677 --> 08:04.643
you have a kid.

08:04.678 --> 08:05.644
Cheyenne has a baby,

08:05.679 --> 08:06.719
does that give her a ding?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.280
No, because I have a baby

08:08.315 --> 08:10.182
the way that Chrissy Teigen has a baby.

08:10.217 --> 08:11.476
You have an old baby,

08:11.477 --> 08:13.619
- so that's a double ding.
- Yeah.

08:13.653 --> 08:16.822
Plus, you're probably really
out of practice sex-wise.

08:16.856 --> 08:17.672
Excuse me?

08:17.673 --> 08:19.671
And I'm guessing your
downstairs is a jungle?

08:19.672 --> 08:20.960
Mm, retro.

08:20.994 --> 08:21.887
Nothing wrong with that.

08:21.888 --> 08:24.296
No, it is a manicu... you know what?

08:24.331 --> 08:25.869
I am not gonna defend myself.

08:25.870 --> 08:29.001
This whole system
of rating people is gross.

08:29.035 --> 08:30.100
What's my number?

08:30.101 --> 08:32.938
Um, you're a four, Justine's a three.

08:32.972 --> 08:35.107
But it's cool, 'cause
I clean up on twos.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.542
Girl's trip!

08:36.576 --> 08:38.611
No, Sarah's a seven, Brett's an eight,

08:38.645 --> 08:41.145
Tate's a ten because
he has a good job and abs.

08:41.181 --> 08:43.048
That's correct, I'm
the complete package.

08:43.082 --> 08:44.950
Wait, what number is Amy? Are we tied?

08:44.951 --> 08:46.227
God, no.

08:47.153 --> 08:48.854
I'm sorry, that was not...

08:48.888 --> 08:50.460
no, I think you're beautiful.

08:50.824 --> 08:52.625
See, this whole system
just sets us back.

08:52.659 --> 08:54.059
You're just a little bit
higher than Justine.

08:54.094 --> 08:55.563
A little higher?

08:56.062 --> 08:58.860
No offense, Justine,
we're all God's creatures.

08:58.891 --> 09:00.392
What?

09:00.435 --> 09:02.201
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers.

09:02.235 --> 09:05.838
Roma tomatoes are now $2.99 a pound.

09:05.872 --> 09:07.172
$2.99, Kelly...

09:07.207 --> 09:10.209
a small price to pay
for a taste of Italy.

09:10.243 --> 09:11.377
That's for sure.

09:11.411 --> 09:13.078
Now, Jonah, I always forget...

09:13.113 --> 09:15.714
are tomatoes a fruit
or are they a vegetable?

09:15.749 --> 09:17.483
<i>Oh, I say vegetables</i>

09:17.517 --> 09:19.585
<i>so I get credit for eating my veggies.</i>

09:19.619 --> 09:20.719
I know, right?

09:20.754 --> 09:22.521
Busted, okay, I'm busted.

09:27.527 --> 09:30.696
Well, someone's looking relaxed.

09:30.730 --> 09:32.665
Huh? Oh, yeah.

09:32.699 --> 09:35.034
I've been staring at these
rocks for the past hour.

09:35.068 --> 09:36.339
If you soften your focus,

09:36.340 --> 09:38.570
it kinda looks like
two bats making paella.

09:38.605 --> 09:40.572
Oh yeah, yeah.

09:40.607 --> 09:42.074
Yeah, anyway, um,

09:42.108 --> 09:44.570
if you really wanna get
up, I guess it's okay,

09:44.571 --> 09:46.445
but you have to promise to take it easy.

09:46.479 --> 09:48.747
Actually, I'd like another
ten minutes if it's okay.

09:48.782 --> 09:51.250
A hummingbird flew by and
I wanna see if he comes back.

09:51.284 --> 09:53.382
Take all the time you need.

09:53.787 --> 09:55.087
Can I get you anything?

09:55.433 --> 09:56.955
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:56.990 --> 09:58.757
I mean, I could use a snack...

09:58.792 --> 09:59.758
just some baby carrots.

09:59.793 --> 10:00.611
Okay.

10:00.612 --> 10:02.127
- And pita chips.
- Mm-hmm.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.253
Ooh, and dips...

10:03.440 --> 10:05.769
hummus, vegan tzatziki, maybe a guac.

10:05.932 --> 10:07.232
Yeah, for sure a guac.

10:07.267 --> 10:08.951
And if you could stack them in a bowl...

10:08.952 --> 10:11.070
preferably glass
so I can see the layers...

10:11.104 --> 10:12.805
that'd be great, thanks.

10:12.839 --> 10:14.273
Okay.

10:14.307 --> 10:15.941
I'll see what we have that wasn't

10:15.975 --> 10:17.594
part of the listeria outbreak.

10:19.079 --> 10:20.117
You think it fits?

10:20.447 --> 10:22.588
Yeah, I don't say this very often,

10:22.589 --> 10:24.750
but that Cloud 9 suit
looks really great on you.

10:24.784 --> 10:25.577
Oh, thanks.

10:27.153 --> 10:29.455
Hey, um, can I ask you a question?

10:29.489 --> 10:30.217
Yeah.

10:30.218 --> 10:33.953
Would you go out on a date
with someone like me?

10:33.954 --> 10:35.213
Oh, I'm married.

10:35.214 --> 10:36.895
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not asking you out.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.630
I just mean, like, theoretically.

10:38.911 --> 10:40.966
Like, say your wife died
and you're single now.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.468
What? Why would she have died?

10:42.502 --> 10:43.802
Okay fine, she never existed,

10:43.837 --> 10:44.710
or she was abducted.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.009
And you're not sad, you're fine.

10:46.010 --> 10:47.172
You were looking for a way out,

10:47.207 --> 10:48.192
and it led you to me,

10:48.193 --> 10:50.342
so on a scale from one to ten,

10:50.377 --> 10:54.102
I'm like a eight minimum, right?

10:55.181 --> 10:57.149
Uh, yeah, um, you know what?

10:57.183 --> 10:59.818
I, uh, I have a lot
of great clothes at home,

10:59.853 --> 11:01.620
so I'll just...

11:01.654 --> 11:03.856
I'll just wear those
before I go out shopping.

11:03.890 --> 11:04.752
Thank you.

11:04.753 --> 11:05.800
Okay.

11:07.394 --> 11:09.094
Garrett, what happened?

11:09.129 --> 11:11.497
Yeah, I don't know,
Sandra was on softlines.

11:11.531 --> 11:12.396
What...

11:12.397 --> 11:13.665
Oh, you know what?

11:13.700 --> 11:16.699
She had to do something,
so I told her she could bounce.

11:17.404 --> 11:18.482
All right, I'll see you later.

11:18.483 --> 11:19.538
No, wh-wh-wh-wh-whoa.

11:19.572 --> 11:22.107
You can't go home
until this is cleaned up.

11:22.142 --> 11:22.908
Seriously?

11:22.909 --> 11:24.476
Well, it's gotta get done,

11:24.511 --> 11:26.574
Mr. Acting Assistant Manager.

11:27.981 --> 11:30.558
Oh, why are these pants moist?

11:31.017 --> 11:32.484
Oh yeah, that happens.

11:32.519 --> 11:33.852
Ugh.

11:35.260 --> 11:35.835
Hey, so, um,

11:35.836 --> 11:36.932
I know this might sound weird,

11:36.939 --> 11:38.765
but on a scale from one to ten...

11:38.766 --> 11:40.492
Sorry, hang on, one second.

11:40.527 --> 11:42.394
Hey, do you wanna run it once
before we get on the mic,

11:42.429 --> 11:45.397
or just kinda dive in and
use that opening night energy?

11:45.432 --> 11:46.698
Let's just go for it.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.367
That's what I thought.

11:48.401 --> 11:50.623
Sorry, what were you saying?

11:51.478 --> 11:52.511
Uh, you're busy.

11:52.939 --> 11:54.173
I'll come back later.

11:54.207 --> 11:57.009
Okay, what do you think?

12:03.917 --> 12:06.185
<i>♪ Swiss cheese is on sale now ♪</i>

12:06.219 --> 12:07.553

12:09.013 --> 12:11.557

12:11.591 --> 12:14.059
Ugh, maybe we should
allow bullying in schools

12:14.093 --> 12:15.604
if it'll prevent stuff like this.

12:15.605 --> 12:17.001
Yeah, tell me about it.

12:17.430 --> 12:18.864
Tough day at the office?

12:18.898 --> 12:20.499
I'm just kidding,
you don't have an office.

12:20.533 --> 12:23.068
You know, it hasn't been great, Tate.

12:23.102 --> 12:24.891
I killed a groundhog... probably...

12:24.892 --> 12:26.538
and if it lives,
it'll never be the same.

12:26.573 --> 12:28.874
And I learned that
on a scale from one to ten,

12:28.908 --> 12:30.342
I am immensely unappealing.

12:30.376 --> 12:32.077
You can't listen
to what people here say.

12:32.111 --> 12:33.251
They're all idiots.

12:33.713 --> 12:35.280
Today, one of them asked me
whether he's supposed

12:35.315 --> 12:37.082
to eat the cotton
inside the pill bottle.

12:37.116 --> 12:38.555
- Elias?
- Elias, yeah.

12:39.834 --> 12:40.886
Look, I know everyone here

12:40.920 --> 12:42.454
is trying to hook you up
with a bunch of randos,

12:42.489 --> 12:44.056
but you should hold out for a good one.

12:44.090 --> 12:45.397
You deserve that.

12:48.127 --> 12:48.903
Well, that...

12:49.005 --> 12:50.729
that kinda sounds like a line,

12:50.763 --> 12:52.067
but, um, thank you.

12:52.465 --> 12:54.266
Well, listen, I don't know
if you feel like a drink,

12:54.300 --> 12:55.885
but I know a great little spot.

12:56.302 --> 12:58.103
I told them that I'm a veteran,

12:58.137 --> 12:59.696
so I drink for half price.

13:04.410 --> 13:05.544
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

13:05.578 --> 13:07.112
Okay, good to know. That's fine.

13:07.146 --> 13:09.281
Um, more drinks please.

13:09.315 --> 13:11.283
Mm, mm.

13:11.317 --> 13:13.285
- Just one second, okay.
- Sure, sure.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.621
- Let's go.
- Okay.

13:27.503 --> 13:28.870
Were you here all night?

13:29.324 --> 13:30.017
Hm?

13:31.380 --> 13:33.108
Oh, yeah, I guess I fell asleep.

13:33.463 --> 13:35.677
Oh wow, I feel rested.

13:36.568 --> 13:38.147
You know, some of my birds
have night terrors,

13:38.148 --> 13:40.083
so it's usually hard
for me to get that deep REM.

13:40.117 --> 13:41.619
Well, ah, that's, that's great.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.135
I'm glad you got some rest.

13:43.705 --> 13:45.499
Yeah, why don't you, uh, you know,

13:45.500 --> 13:47.791
get changed and we'll get to work, huh?

13:47.825 --> 13:48.907
Yeah, okay.

13:48.908 --> 13:51.010
Hey, it's gonna be a big day.

13:51.011 --> 13:52.262
Quarterlies are due.

13:52.296 --> 13:54.631
Plus, we're doing
double coupons on catheters,

13:54.665 --> 13:56.066
and at least two retirement homes

13:56.100 --> 13:57.600
are bussing in the oldies.

13:57.635 --> 13:59.498
Ooh, boy.

13:59.694 --> 14:01.361
- What?
- Oh, I...

14:01.505 --> 14:03.106
Just got this feeling like a marble

14:03.140 --> 14:05.308
rolling around in my uterus, I mean,

14:05.351 --> 14:07.112
gosh, I wonder what that's about.

14:07.265 --> 14:08.498
Probably nothing.

14:08.744 --> 14:10.121
Anyway, up and at 'em.

14:10.123 --> 14:12.390
No, no, no, no, you stay on that couch!

14:12.650 --> 14:13.983
That sweet little marble

14:14.018 --> 14:15.352
is the only thing that matters.

14:15.386 --> 14:17.754
Okay, I mean, I will continue to lay,

14:17.788 --> 14:18.940
but only if that's what you want.

14:18.942 --> 14:19.702
I do.

14:20.030 --> 14:20.997
You relax.

14:21.959 --> 14:23.827
Hey, would you mind grabbing me

14:23.861 --> 14:25.662
some wet wipes and a bottle of Febreze?

14:25.696 --> 14:28.465
I wanna take a little whore's
bath before the store opens.

14:32.203 --> 14:34.033
Well, hey there, brown hair.

14:34.472 --> 14:35.260
Hi.

14:35.431 --> 14:36.281
Hi.

14:37.188 --> 14:39.089
Okay, bye.

14:39.343 --> 14:42.612
Well, I woke up feeling
very satisfied this morning.

14:42.646 --> 14:44.614
Must've been the great
night I had last night.

14:44.648 --> 14:47.174
Cool, um, I threw up in my driveway.

14:47.175 --> 14:48.186
Oof.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.285
So, um, Tate,

14:49.320 --> 14:52.822
last night was fun and impulsive.

14:52.857 --> 14:54.524
- Mm-hmm.
- And expensive.

14:54.558 --> 14:56.467
Yeah, sorry I forgot my credit card.

14:57.061 --> 14:58.344
Yeah, uh,

14:58.729 --> 15:01.364
but I think it would be great
if we kept it between us.

15:01.399 --> 15:02.562
You know how people around here

15:02.593 --> 15:05.128
talk and gossip,
and we don't want that, so...

15:05.366 --> 15:06.231
Understood.

15:06.234 --> 15:07.668
Your secret's safe with me.

15:08.038 --> 15:10.198
When I journal about this...
and I will...

15:10.786 --> 15:12.768
I will call you Consuela.

15:13.744 --> 15:14.508
Okay.

15:14.604 --> 15:17.032
Adios, Consuela.

15:20.885 --> 15:22.552
Protip... if you cup the mic,

15:22.586 --> 15:24.204
you get a nice voice-of-God effect.

15:24.205 --> 15:25.889
Oh, why don't you go out to Los Angeles

15:25.923 --> 15:27.390
and give Laura Dern some acting tips?

15:27.425 --> 15:29.325
- Always with Laura Dern.
- She's amazing.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.095
Okay, I gotta go feed Dina's birds,

15:32.129 --> 15:33.930
so today's the same as yesterday.

15:33.964 --> 15:34.946
Garrett, you're AM,

15:34.947 --> 15:36.723
Jonah and Kelly,
you're on announcements.

15:36.724 --> 15:38.141
- Wait, no, I just...
- No. No.

15:38.142 --> 15:39.370
I don't have time to argue, okay?

15:39.371 --> 15:42.399
I gotta go Google how
to give insulin to a parrot.

15:45.754 --> 15:47.583
So, this is my cousin, Nestor.

15:47.611 --> 15:49.078
He is studying to be a receptionist,

15:49.113 --> 15:50.583
and he sleeps on the top bunk.

15:50.584 --> 15:51.647
Hard pass.

15:51.648 --> 15:54.017
Okay, you can't just wait
for the Rogelios of the world.

15:54.051 --> 15:55.185
You gotta lower the bar a little.

15:55.219 --> 15:56.886
Yeah, eventually you're gonna

15:56.921 --> 15:58.755
have to put yourself back out there.

15:59.145 --> 16:00.084
Okay,

16:00.658 --> 16:02.892
not that it's any of your business,

16:02.927 --> 16:05.059
but, um, last night,

16:05.569 --> 16:07.136
I did put myself out there.

16:07.398 --> 16:09.599
Wait, you hooked up? With who?

16:09.633 --> 16:11.018
Doesn't matter, all you need to know

16:11.019 --> 16:12.916
is that I can definitely
do better than Nestor.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.230
Was it a guy or a girl?

16:14.688 --> 16:16.322
- Guy.
- Does he work here?

16:16.474 --> 16:18.608
- Yes, but I really shouldn't...
- Does he wear a hat?

16:18.642 --> 16:21.113
Sometimes, I don't know.
We're not playing "Guess Who?"

16:21.145 --> 16:23.336
Was it Brett? 'Cause
I've been shipping you guys.

16:23.337 --> 16:24.025
No.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.107
Oh, my God, did you have
a three-way with Elias?

16:26.108 --> 16:28.218
What? These are your guesses?

16:28.252 --> 16:30.960
No, it was somebody better-looking,

16:30.961 --> 16:32.989
someone more on my level.

16:33.023 --> 16:34.624
- Marcus.
- Cody.

16:34.658 --> 16:36.426
- Mary.
- Okay, it was Tate.

16:36.869 --> 16:38.328
- Tate?
- You bitch.

16:38.362 --> 16:40.163
Yeah, and it wasn't a big deal,

16:40.197 --> 16:42.298
and technically, he's a ten,

16:42.333 --> 16:43.800
and he was totally into it.

16:43.834 --> 16:46.235
So, maybe do the math on that.

16:48.939 --> 16:50.395
So, hang on now,

16:50.396 --> 16:52.642
Sandra, you're from Hawaii,

16:52.676 --> 16:53.977
but you've never been to the beach?

16:54.011 --> 16:55.116
What?

16:55.117 --> 16:57.369
No, I am deathly afraid of the water.

16:57.370 --> 16:57.909
Uh!

16:57.910 --> 16:59.231
Never even saw the ocean.

16:59.232 --> 17:01.054
Wow, that is too much.

17:01.055 --> 17:02.860
Now, are you afraid of all water,

17:02.861 --> 17:04.233
or just the ocean?

17:05.055 --> 17:07.700
I'd like to answer your
question with another question.

17:07.701 --> 17:09.183
Where do hermit crabs live?

17:09.184 --> 17:10.859
Get a load of her.

17:10.895 --> 17:12.161
Where don't they live?

17:12.195 --> 17:13.663
You know what I mean?

17:20.013 --> 17:20.997
There she is.

17:22.071 --> 17:23.606
So, I was thinking that maybe we could

17:23.641 --> 17:25.675
head up the Delta Sky Lounge,

17:25.709 --> 17:28.344
drop some miles at the bar,
see where it goes.

17:28.378 --> 17:30.517
- Tate, I was thinking.
- Yeah?

17:30.518 --> 17:34.744
Maybe we should just keep
last night as a one-time thing.

17:35.553 --> 17:36.486
Oh.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.655
It's just that, like,
I was in a weird place

17:38.689 --> 17:40.623
and I was sort of
feeling down on myself,

17:40.658 --> 17:42.025
and people even
in this store were saying,

17:42.059 --> 17:43.226
like, I couldn't bag a ten.

17:43.260 --> 17:44.197
Okay, so,

17:44.198 --> 17:45.517
I was just some kind of trophy

17:45.518 --> 17:46.996
for you to wave around to your friends?

17:47.031 --> 17:47.882
Is that it, huh?

17:47.883 --> 17:49.365
Another notch in your bedpost?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.134
Shh, shh, no.

17:51.168 --> 17:53.702
Tate, can we please
just not make a scene?

17:53.703 --> 17:55.238
Well, well, well.

17:55.272 --> 17:57.574
- Look who banged the pharmacist.
- Yeah.

17:57.608 --> 17:59.900
I guess sometimes
Kermit goes home with Beaker.

18:02.023 --> 18:03.890
I thought you didn't
date people from work.

18:03.891 --> 18:06.096
I didn't, I don't, we're not dating.

18:06.167 --> 18:08.115
Oh, no, you made that abundantly clear.

18:08.116 --> 18:09.693
I guess I'm just a human vibrator,

18:09.693 --> 18:10.806
built for Amy's pleasure.

18:10.807 --> 18:13.530
Okay, um, could we just, you know,

18:13.564 --> 18:15.365
this is a very public space.

18:15.399 --> 18:17.000
May I remind you that I had dibs,

18:17.034 --> 18:20.003
so whatever you did with him,
you also have to do with me.

18:20.037 --> 18:21.271
Yep, that's what's fair.

18:21.305 --> 18:22.372
Um, that's not a thing.

18:22.406 --> 18:23.407
But you promised.

18:23.408 --> 18:25.208
Oh, so you're just
tossing that cat around,

18:25.242 --> 18:26.543
but Nestor can't get a turn.

18:26.577 --> 18:30.113
I'm not tossing anything around,

18:30.147 --> 18:33.616
and I don't want to be
dating anyone anywhere.

18:33.651 --> 18:34.851
Well, that's not
how it seemed yesterday.

18:34.892 --> 18:36.066
You were totally hitting on me.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.122
What are you doing here?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.404
It's a store, I'm allowed to be here.

18:38.424 --> 18:39.348
Unbelievable.

18:39.473 --> 18:40.757
Someone's thirsty.

18:40.758 --> 18:41.773
Guys, enough.

18:42.059 --> 18:43.249
Look, I had dibs,

18:43.250 --> 18:47.530
so the order goes me,
beard guy, then Nestor,

18:47.565 --> 18:49.299
before we come
back around to Tate again.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.667
What's going on?

18:50.701 --> 18:51.835
Amy hooked up with Tate,

18:51.869 --> 18:53.203
and then asked bearded guy out

18:53.237 --> 18:54.337
even though Marcus has dibs.

18:54.371 --> 18:55.371
Nestor's still in the mix,

18:55.406 --> 18:56.706
and that woman needs Tide,

18:56.740 --> 18:58.341
but no one's helping her.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.210
You hooked up with Tate?

19:00.235 --> 19:00.953
Um, I...

19:01.109 --> 19:04.814
I mean, wow, it's a big day for you.

19:04.849 --> 19:06.883
Maybe you need to take
a little break from dating

19:06.917 --> 19:07.861
and get tested.

19:07.862 --> 19:09.586
I can't take a break from dating

19:09.620 --> 19:11.221
because I never started dating.

19:11.255 --> 19:14.023
Yeah, guys, she's just
banging out dudes right now.

19:14.058 --> 19:15.525
Bzz, bzz, bzz.

19:15.559 --> 19:17.393
Human vibrator reporting for duty.

19:17.428 --> 19:19.062
Yeah, turn me on, use me up,

19:19.096 --> 19:20.338
and chuck me back in the drawer.

19:20.339 --> 19:21.481
I just want the Tide.

19:21.482 --> 19:23.733
Aisle 17. Stop ruining this.

19:23.767 --> 19:26.464
Yep, get back in there.

19:28.205 --> 19:30.540
Ohh, mama.

19:30.574 --> 19:32.342
I think I wanna call Jerusha

19:32.376 --> 19:33.743
and tell her what we're doing.

19:33.777 --> 19:35.811
Already called her. She's cool with it.

19:38.315 --> 19:39.638
There it is.

19:39.950 --> 19:40.583
Yeah...

19:48.092 --> 19:49.008
Hey, Garrett.

19:49.332 --> 19:50.800
So, softlines is all good.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.228
Could I maybe take an early lunch?

19:52.263 --> 19:53.396
My cat's in the hospice.

19:53.430 --> 19:54.797
No, if I let you leave early,

19:54.832 --> 19:56.099
then I have to take
somebody off register,

19:56.133 --> 19:57.011
to cover your section.

19:57.012 --> 19:59.536
Yeah, but this is my
last chance to say goodbye.

19:59.570 --> 20:00.788
Shut up, Sandra!

20:03.411 --> 20:04.134
I'm not...

20:05.307 --> 20:06.486
this is not...

20:08.312 --> 20:09.400
here, you take it.

20:09.747 --> 20:11.031
You be the assistant manager.

20:11.032 --> 20:11.590
What?

20:11.590 --> 20:12.522
Just take it!

20:19.857 --> 20:21.457
Cloud 9's new bath towels

20:21.492 --> 20:24.127
are extra fluffy and made
from recycled other towels.

20:24.161 --> 20:25.428
And here to talk to us about them

20:25.462 --> 20:27.282
is famous actor, Al Pacino.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.178
How's Hollywood, Al?

20:30.000 --> 20:33.006
Oh, uh, these towels are great.

20:33.031 --> 20:33.968
Hoo-ah.

20:35.506 --> 20:36.739
Are you okay?

20:36.774 --> 20:38.474
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm just,

20:38.516 --> 20:40.219
I'm not really feeling it, so...

20:40.417 --> 20:42.249
Oh, okay.

20:44.215 --> 20:45.949
If you like towels,

20:45.983 --> 20:46.783
then, uh,

20:46.817 --> 20:49.619
this is "The Godfather" of towels.

20:49.653 --> 20:52.488
You can use them to clean
up your "Scarface."

20:52.523 --> 20:54.690
That is not good.

20:55.826 --> 20:59.014
- These towels are 40% off.
- No...

20:59.015 --> 21:00.463
I mean...

21:00.497 --> 21:03.192
These towels are 40% off.

21:03.534 --> 21:05.668
And even if it's not a question,

21:05.703 --> 21:07.337
you gotta end up here.

21:07.371 --> 21:08.671
But then you're down,

21:08.706 --> 21:09.973
then you're down here.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.507
<i>Because when you were younger,</i>

21:11.542 --> 21:12.609
<i>when you were in "Serpico"...</i>

21:12.643 --> 21:13.876
<i>No...</i>

21:13.911 --> 21:17.513
Hoo-ah, I'm just getting warmed up.

21:17.548 --> 21:20.083
Al Pacino, everyone. He's back.
