00:00.794 --> 00:04.253
On this head-spinning
episode of "MythBusters"...

00:05.554 --> 00:08.985
...Adam and Jamie fire up
a fearsome explosive...

00:08.987 --> 00:11.386
That's one way to cut up a watermelon.

00:11.388 --> 00:13.792
...as they test a military myth...

00:13.794 --> 00:15.634
You're not nervous about
making the shot, are you?

00:15.636 --> 00:18.906
...that C-4 is
a serviceable cooking fuel...

00:18.908 --> 00:20.280
Mmm. It's not bad.

00:20.282 --> 00:23.284
...but if subjected
to heavy-hitting action...

00:23.286 --> 00:24.955
Oh! It's on his shoe!

00:24.957 --> 00:26.756
...creates a culinary catastrophe.

00:26.758 --> 00:28.728
There it goes...
pouring right onto the C-4.

00:30.033 --> 00:32.802
Meanwhile, Kari, Grant, and Tory...

00:32.804 --> 00:35.071
Chin up, buddy. It's gonna be
over before you know it.

00:35.073 --> 00:37.473
...mull a martial-arts myth

00:38.542 --> 00:40.509
that a fabled flying guillotine...

00:40.511 --> 00:42.711
Somebody's losing a finger on this shoot.

00:42.713 --> 00:46.047
...can decapitate and capture your cranium.

00:46.049 --> 00:48.549
You ready? Let's do this.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.853
Who are the MythBusters?

00:53.655 --> 00:55.557
Adam Savage...

00:55.559 --> 00:57.426
70% chance of science.

00:57.428 --> 00:59.096
...and Jamie Hyneman.

00:59.098 --> 01:00.231
We're gonna have an adventure.

01:00.233 --> 01:01.799
Between them,

01:01.801 --> 01:05.205
more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:05.206 --> 01:06.974
Together with Tory Belleci...

01:06.976 --> 01:08.876
Wasn't ready for that one, Kari.

01:08.878 --> 01:10.512
...Grant Imahara...

01:10.514 --> 01:11.646
Something just touched me!

01:11.648 --> 01:12.581
...and Kari Byron.

01:12.583 --> 01:13.715
Let's do it.

01:13.717 --> 01:17.153
They don't just tell the myths.

01:17.155 --> 01:19.923
They put them to the test.

01:19.925 --> 01:24.925

01:31.801 --> 01:33.234
What's with the stove?

01:33.236 --> 01:34.603
It is our next story.

01:34.605 --> 01:36.671
- It's about cooking?
- Sort of.

01:36.673 --> 01:37.806
It is a military myth,

01:37.808 --> 01:40.109
and it's about replacing
your normal cooking fuel

01:40.111 --> 01:44.048
with something usually
considered far more destructive.

01:47.488 --> 01:49.054
Well, that would be C-4.

01:49.056 --> 01:50.055
Exactly.

01:50.057 --> 01:52.792
The myth is that C-4 is so stable,

01:52.794 --> 01:54.060
you can light it with a match

01:54.062 --> 01:56.330
and it will burn and cook your lunch.

01:56.332 --> 01:57.698
And it doesn't explode?

01:57.700 --> 01:59.033
It won't.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.969
Although you're told not to stomp on it

02:00.971 --> 02:02.005
or drop your pot on it

02:02.007 --> 02:03.707
'cause that could make it blow up.

02:03.709 --> 02:05.341
Well, that would make for some hot chili.

02:05.343 --> 02:06.676
Indeed.

02:06.678 --> 02:08.311
C-4.

02:08.312 --> 02:11.081
Not just the explosive of choice
for the MythBusters...

02:12.149 --> 02:14.852
When in doubt, C-4.

02:15.821 --> 02:17.855
...but also the military.

02:17.857 --> 02:21.959
But can C-4's power
be used another way...

02:21.961 --> 02:24.027
to cook with, without exploding?

02:24.029 --> 02:25.362
Well, that's great.

02:25.364 --> 02:27.864
Well, there's two parts to this story.

02:27.866 --> 02:30.433
One is that supposedly
you can light C-4 on fire

02:30.435 --> 02:32.202
and it will burn without blowing up,

02:32.204 --> 02:34.405
and the second is, is that you
better not drop a pot on it

02:34.407 --> 02:35.907
or stomp on it while it's on fire

02:35.909 --> 02:37.542
'cause that <i>could</i> make it blow up.

02:37.544 --> 02:39.310
I think we should test both of those.

02:39.312 --> 02:40.912
Sure.

02:40.914 --> 02:44.884
So, to find out if this myth
is cooking with gas,

02:44.886 --> 02:46.386
or just a flash in the pan,

02:46.388 --> 02:49.389
the guys head to the safety
of... you guessed it...

02:49.391 --> 02:50.858
a bomb range.

02:50.860 --> 02:53.728
Now, before we get down to the
business of testing this myth,

02:53.730 --> 02:56.030
let's reacquaint ourselves
with C-4, shall we?

02:56.032 --> 02:59.234
For this is not simply a stable,
high-speed explosive

02:59.236 --> 03:00.569
in a plastic medium

03:00.571 --> 03:02.771
that you can mold into the shape
of a bunny and blow up.

03:03.775 --> 03:05.608
Oh, no. This is versatile stuff.

03:05.610 --> 03:08.011
Let's take a look
at a simple C-4 detonation.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.180
This is why the military likes C-4.

03:10.182 --> 03:12.516
It can make things go away.

03:12.518 --> 03:15.152
That's one way to cut up a watermelon.

03:15.154 --> 03:19.023
But it's also a precision device, too.

03:19.025 --> 03:21.325
This piece of metal
bent into a "W" shape

03:21.327 --> 03:24.228
is going to cut this bar cleanly in half.

03:24.230 --> 03:26.931
That's right. "W" stands for "whupah!"

03:26.933 --> 03:28.032
3, 2...

03:31.170 --> 03:34.706
That is beautiful.
Look at that nice, clean cut.

03:34.708 --> 03:36.908
I could do a little better with a saw,

03:36.910 --> 03:38.610
but it does, indeed, work.

03:38.612 --> 03:40.612
Now that we've seen how it detonates,

03:40.614 --> 03:43.282
it's time to tackle our story,
which, simply stated,

03:43.284 --> 03:46.085
is that this stuff...
C-4 plastic explosive...

03:46.087 --> 03:48.687
is stable enough
to actually light on fire

03:48.689 --> 03:50.223
and heat your lunch with,

03:50.225 --> 03:53.359
that it will not blow up,
even if you set it on fire.

03:53.361 --> 03:55.229
That's what we're about to test.

03:55.231 --> 03:58.432
Okay, why might burning C-4 explode?

03:58.434 --> 04:01.636
Well, heat causes molecules
to become excited.

04:01.638 --> 04:05.073
The greater the heat,
the more the molecule mania,

04:05.075 --> 04:10.646
and that can cause instability
and possibly an explosion.

04:10.648 --> 04:13.449
So, from the safety of their bunker,

04:13.451 --> 04:15.583
and ignited by a remote,
neon transformer...

04:16.819 --> 04:18.119
You ready?

04:18.120 --> 04:19.286
Igniting C-4,

04:19.288 --> 04:21.922
seeing if it burns without blowing up,

04:21.923 --> 04:23.824
in 3, 2, 1...

04:25.226 --> 04:26.226
- Yup.
- It's burning.

04:27.294 --> 04:31.030
Wow. [ Laughs ] It's really burning.

04:31.032 --> 04:32.765
It burns hot.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.834
But blowing up, it ain't.

04:34.836 --> 04:37.237
I don't think I'd want to
be next to that.

04:37.239 --> 04:39.373
I don't care what they say.

04:40.643 --> 04:42.977
The C-4 burned at more than 1,000 degrees,

04:42.979 --> 04:45.180
rapidly and without a kaboom.

04:45.182 --> 04:49.484
That's very good news
for this myth, so far.

04:49.486 --> 04:51.587
Now that we know it burns,
let's see how well it cooks.

04:54.891 --> 04:56.993
Meanwhile, Grant, Kari, and Tory

04:56.995 --> 04:59.861
are attempting to wrap their heads around

04:59.863 --> 05:01.930
a mysterious martial-arts myth.

05:01.932 --> 05:03.164
All right, Kari,
what's with the cool costume?

05:03.166 --> 05:04.766
Take a deep breath.

05:04.768 --> 05:06.734
We're doing a kung-fu myth.

05:06.736 --> 05:08.068
- Yes!
- Yes!

05:08.070 --> 05:09.103
Which one?

05:09.105 --> 05:10.137
"The flying guillotine."

05:10.139 --> 05:12.473
- Oh, I love that movie!
- Yes!

05:12.475 --> 05:13.941
That's the one where
the guy has a weapon.

05:13.943 --> 05:15.009
It's like a hat.

05:15.011 --> 05:16.577
He throws it over the other guy's head,

05:16.579 --> 05:18.679
and he pulls the chain,
and it decapitates him!

05:18.681 --> 05:19.981
Calm down.

05:19.983 --> 05:21.950
Yeah, and not only that,
but once you cut the head off,

05:21.952 --> 05:24.553
you can actually retrieve
the head back to the thrower.

05:24.555 --> 05:25.721
Well, I think the cool thing is

05:25.723 --> 05:27.022
that this might be
more than a movie myth.

05:27.024 --> 05:29.258
This might be an actual, ancient weapon.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.926
It could work.

05:32.296 --> 05:35.931
Made famous by B-grade kung-fu movies,

05:35.933 --> 05:39.501
the flying guillotine was a disc
that, when thrown over the neck,

05:39.503 --> 05:43.204
would decapitate and capture
the victim's head.

05:43.206 --> 05:46.340
But it might not just be
a filmmaker's fantasy

05:46.342 --> 05:49.076
because legend has it emperor Yongzheng

05:49.078 --> 05:51.645
commissioned the device in 1722.

05:51.647 --> 05:53.847
But unfortunately for the MythBusters,

05:53.849 --> 05:56.683
no drawings of the design survive.

05:56.685 --> 05:58.852
Okay, what a terrifying concept...

05:58.854 --> 06:01.120
assassins that can behead you
from a distance?

06:01.122 --> 06:03.289
But you know what? The real problem
right now is finding a design.

06:03.291 --> 06:05.392
I mean, we've been through
all these history books

06:05.394 --> 06:06.660
and found nothing.

06:06.662 --> 06:09.230
I mean, the only designs
come from the movies themselves.

06:09.232 --> 06:11.232
I mean, we're on our own on this one.

06:11.234 --> 06:12.967
All right, well, why don't we
come up with some prototypes?

06:12.969 --> 06:14.669
We can incorporate some ideas
from the movies

06:14.671 --> 06:17.539
and come up with our own ideas
and see which works best.

06:17.541 --> 06:19.308
So, we might actually get to design

06:19.310 --> 06:20.776
our own flying guillotine?

06:20.778 --> 06:22.445
This is awesome.

06:22.447 --> 06:25.582
So, in order to test whether
the mythical flying guillotine

06:25.584 --> 06:27.651
was a viable assassination weapon,

06:27.653 --> 06:30.454
they're going to divide and compete

06:30.456 --> 06:33.990
to see if they can design
their own flying guillotine

06:33.992 --> 06:35.925
based on four parameters.

06:35.927 --> 06:38.294
One... enough power to cut the head off.

06:38.296 --> 06:40.763
Two... it has to be light enough
to be thrown.

06:40.765 --> 06:42.898
Three... it has to be
safe enough to be deployed

06:42.900 --> 06:44.600
without cutting your own fingers off.

06:44.602 --> 06:48.803
And four... you have to have
some means to retrieve the head.

06:48.805 --> 06:51.272
With each of them working alone,

06:51.274 --> 06:54.342
it's going to test the team's
prototyping skills to the limit.

06:54.344 --> 06:57.612
Now, a traditional
guillotine gets its cutting force

06:57.614 --> 06:59.447
from the fact that you have
a massive blade

06:59.449 --> 07:01.415
traveling a long distance

07:01.417 --> 07:04.452
to create enough force
to chop a head off.

07:04.454 --> 07:06.487
We have to make our devices lightweight,

07:06.489 --> 07:08.623
and we only have about
six inches of travel

07:08.625 --> 07:10.391
to create that same sort of force.

07:10.393 --> 07:13.895
In their respective corners of the shop,

07:13.897 --> 07:16.998
the guys begin by playing with
ideas and concepts

07:17.000 --> 07:19.267
that may or may not work.

07:19.269 --> 07:22.003
All right, so, I had a great
idea for a flying guillotine.

07:22.005 --> 07:24.272
I asked the researchers
to find me a bear trap.

07:24.274 --> 07:27.174
Hopefully this would have enough energy

07:27.176 --> 07:30.678
to actually crush through
a person's head.

07:33.048 --> 07:34.983
Clearly there's enough force, but...

07:36.286 --> 07:40.055
...throwing this through the air
could be problematic.

07:40.057 --> 07:43.125
Meaning it's gonna be a
"try it and see" kind of process.

07:44.194 --> 07:45.627
Yeah!

07:45.629 --> 07:47.630
Sometimes in the design process,

07:47.632 --> 07:50.299
you just have to get in there
and get your hands dirty.

07:50.301 --> 07:53.035
Because there are no historical
documents, no blueprints,

07:53.037 --> 07:55.103
no plans for a flying guillotine,

07:55.105 --> 07:57.840
we're just gonna have
to figure this out as we go,

07:57.842 --> 08:00.342
which is gonna mean
a lot of trial and error.

08:00.344 --> 08:02.310
Probably, mostly error.

08:02.312 --> 08:03.745
And that's immediately clear

08:03.747 --> 08:05.113
from Kari's first fiddle with a fan

08:05.115 --> 08:07.248
from an air-conditioning duct.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.250
It's hard to use, it's getting heavy,

08:09.252 --> 08:11.352
and I just don't think it's gonna work.

08:11.354 --> 08:14.088
So it's back to square one for Kari.

08:14.090 --> 08:15.857
And likewise, on Belleci's bench,

08:15.859 --> 08:18.627
this lethal-looking,
scissor prototype he's made

08:18.629 --> 08:21.097
is also a dud.

08:21.099 --> 08:23.533
Uh, my flying guillotine
doesn't work at all.

08:23.535 --> 08:25.468
I mean, it kind of looks cool...

08:27.505 --> 08:30.174
...but if you put something inside of it...

08:31.576 --> 08:34.010
...like, that's the safest place to be.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.179
Despite the pressure
of their early designs

08:37.182 --> 08:40.283
failing on several fronts,
the guys aren't deterred.

08:40.284 --> 08:42.318
I'm gonna have to come up
with a whole new design.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.553
After all, learning from your failures

08:44.555 --> 08:46.689
is all part of the prototype process,

08:46.691 --> 08:47.990
which is exactly what Kari does

08:47.992 --> 08:51.092
by opting for a far simpler concept.

08:51.094 --> 08:52.627
Picture a cigar cutter.

08:52.629 --> 08:56.498
Basically, just have a blade on
the rim of the hat that goes...

08:56.500 --> 08:59.434
Takes the head right off.

08:59.436 --> 09:02.872
Meanwhile, using an
authentic Ching Dynasty design app,

09:02.874 --> 09:06.510
Grant has decided simpler is not better.

09:06.512 --> 09:08.378
Now, what you need in
order to cut someone's head off

09:08.380 --> 09:11.148
with a blade is speed and power.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.316
Now, we've got this ring

09:12.318 --> 09:13.951
that's supposed to go
over someone's head,

09:13.953 --> 09:15.553
but that doesn't leave a lot of space

09:15.555 --> 09:18.688
for the blades inside of it
to accelerate.

09:18.690 --> 09:22.025
So my solution is to actually
cock the blades all the way back

09:22.027 --> 09:25.429
and let them swing out and around.

09:25.431 --> 09:27.564
With his lawn mower of death

09:27.566 --> 09:30.101
sporting five,
highly sprung cutting blades,

09:30.103 --> 09:32.103
Grant's ready to pull the pin.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.773
Aah!

09:34.775 --> 09:38.510
That was close.

09:38.512 --> 09:39.912
Okay, this could be
the most dangerous experiment

09:39.914 --> 09:41.114
we've ever worked on.

09:41.116 --> 09:43.149
Forget car crashes, explosions, guns...

09:43.151 --> 09:44.985
Aah! Aah!

09:44.987 --> 09:46.687
...somebody's losing a finger
on this shoot.

09:48.757 --> 09:50.057
Don't cry wolf, Kari.

09:51.061 --> 09:52.961
'Cause then you're gonna get hurt

09:52.963 --> 09:55.230
and no one's gonna rush to help you.

09:55.232 --> 09:56.765
Still to come...

09:56.767 --> 09:59.834
Flaming C-4 feels the full force
of the MythBusters.

09:59.836 --> 10:01.837
This is gonna be fun.

10:01.839 --> 10:03.538
And the flying guillotines make...

10:03.540 --> 10:04.673
Aah!

10:04.675 --> 10:05.740
...headway.

10:05.742 --> 10:07.108
- Yeah!
- Nice!

10:13.920 --> 10:17.656
Can you cook
your goose safely using C-4?

10:17.658 --> 10:20.525
The military myth says you can,

10:20.527 --> 10:22.762
and Jamie and Adam are
hot on the trail to find out.

10:22.764 --> 10:24.797
It's really burning.

10:24.799 --> 10:26.598
So far, they've seen it does burn.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.667
But that's not all.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.938
Let's just pause and take
a moment here to recognize

10:31.940 --> 10:36.808
that we just ignited
a high explosive and burned it,

10:36.810 --> 10:38.643
and it didn't blow up.

10:38.645 --> 10:40.378
This is gonna be fun.

10:40.380 --> 10:41.912
Given this is a military myth,

10:41.914 --> 10:44.815
they're going to use a "ready
to heat and eat" military meal.

10:44.817 --> 10:48.151
All right. Time to choose
what we're gonna cook.

10:48.153 --> 10:49.652
So, what's for dinner, chef?

10:49.654 --> 10:51.154
Well, we've got four choices...

10:51.156 --> 10:53.823
spaghetti with meat sauce,
pork sausage with cream gravy,

10:53.825 --> 10:56.426
southwest style beef
and black beans with sauce,

10:56.428 --> 10:58.929
or... my personal favorite...
the brisket entrÃ©e.

10:58.931 --> 11:00.163
I'm going with pork.

11:00.165 --> 11:02.732
We always go with pork
in these explosive experiments,

11:02.734 --> 11:03.867
don't we?

11:03.869 --> 11:04.934
- Done. Let's do it. Here you go.
- Okay.

11:04.936 --> 11:06.369
So, all that's left to do now

11:06.371 --> 11:10.106
is retire to a safe distance
and light the C-4.

11:10.108 --> 11:11.641
We're good to go.

11:11.643 --> 11:14.477
Here we go. Cooking lunch with C-4,

11:14.479 --> 11:17.314
in 3, 2, 1...

11:19.116 --> 11:20.984
We have ignition.

11:20.986 --> 11:22.719
It's burning beautifully.

11:23.587 --> 11:24.587
Wow, and that's it.

11:24.589 --> 11:26.322
It's like two minutes, it burns out.

11:26.324 --> 11:30.027
Yeah, it burns vigorously,
but a little too quickly.

11:30.029 --> 11:31.495
Let's see how hot we got the food.

11:31.497 --> 11:34.264
Indeed, the proof of the pudding
is in the eating.

11:34.266 --> 11:36.266
Eating food cooked with C-4.

11:37.969 --> 11:40.469
It's not bad, but it's not hot.

11:40.471 --> 11:42.604
No. It's kind of warm.

11:42.606 --> 11:45.173
With the C-4-cooked MRE barely lukewarm,

11:45.175 --> 11:47.642
the guys now want to scientifically test

11:47.644 --> 11:49.812
how C-4 compares

11:49.814 --> 11:53.081
with three other commercially
available cooking fuels.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.350
After all, if other fuels are better,

11:55.352 --> 11:59.354
why would a soldier even resort
to using C-4?

11:59.356 --> 12:01.890
So, these are our cooking fuels.

12:01.892 --> 12:04.026
There are tablets that you might
normally use while camping

12:04.028 --> 12:07.029
made of hexamethylenetetramine.

12:07.031 --> 12:09.264
There's a trioxane tablet,

12:09.266 --> 12:12.100
which is issued by the military
for their rations.

12:12.102 --> 12:16.070
And there is chafing-dish fuel,
which is basically an alcohol.

12:16.072 --> 12:18.973
Each of the fuels
will be ignited simultaneously,

12:18.975 --> 12:21.475
and each will then attempt to do its best

12:21.477 --> 12:24.410
to heat up an identically sized
pot of water.

12:24.412 --> 12:27.146
This is comparative
cooking test, four fuels...

12:27.148 --> 12:32.719
including C-4... in 3, 2, 1, go.

12:32.721 --> 12:35.055
The neon transformer
simultaneously sparks up

12:35.057 --> 12:37.058
all four fuels,

12:37.060 --> 12:39.093
each of which weighs one ounce.

12:39.095 --> 12:40.495
The C-4 is definitely going.

12:40.497 --> 12:41.763
Yeah, they're all going.

12:41.765 --> 12:42.731
Now we wait.

12:42.733 --> 12:44.466
Now we wait.

12:44.468 --> 12:47.336
But that wait isn't long,

12:47.338 --> 12:50.673
as the C-4 burns itself out
in two minutes...

12:50.675 --> 12:53.975
The C-4's water is at
117 degrees Fahrenheit.

12:53.977 --> 12:56.477
Everything else is burning along merrily.

12:56.479 --> 12:58.045
...closely followed by the trioxane,

12:58.047 --> 13:00.981
the fuel of choice by the military.

13:00.983 --> 13:05.518
All right, trioxane got up to 120 degrees.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.421
And then
the hexamethylenetetramine.

13:08.423 --> 13:12.693
149 degrees Fahrenheit.

13:12.695 --> 13:15.329
Finally, the chafing dish.

13:15.331 --> 13:20.001
Ha! A measly 115 degrees Fahrenheit.

13:20.003 --> 13:22.404
So, how did our C-4 do
in the cooking fuel cook-off?

13:22.406 --> 13:23.873
Not badly.

13:23.875 --> 13:26.342
By this chart here, we can see
that one of our fuels,

13:26.344 --> 13:28.545
hexamethylenetetramine,
did a spectacular job,

13:28.547 --> 13:31.848
heating the water
to a piping-hot 149 degrees.

13:31.850 --> 13:35.319
The other two, the chafing-dish
fuel and trioxane,

13:35.321 --> 13:38.221
heated within a couple of degrees of C-4.

13:38.223 --> 13:41.458
And you'll note,
C-4 did the job a lot faster.

13:41.460 --> 13:45.496
That tells me it not only burns,
it is a viable cooking fuel.

13:50.301 --> 13:54.270
Kari, Grant, and Tory
are going kung-fu crazy...

13:56.006 --> 13:58.907
...testing the myth of
the Chinese flying guillotine.

13:58.909 --> 14:02.444
You think cutting
my head off will kill me? Hm!

14:02.446 --> 14:05.079
Their first set of designs
were uniformly successful...

14:05.814 --> 14:07.816
...at failing.

14:07.818 --> 14:08.883
That's the safest place to be.

14:08.885 --> 14:10.652
Tory's latest idea

14:10.654 --> 14:13.855
is as clever as it is potentially deadly.

14:13.857 --> 14:15.524
This one is a very simple design.

14:15.526 --> 14:16.859
It's a steel ring sharpened,

14:16.861 --> 14:19.328
but then there is a groove
on the outside of the ring

14:19.330 --> 14:22.063
that I have wrapped this cable around.

14:22.065 --> 14:23.098
Let's see if it works.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.399
Okay. Stand back, everyone,

14:24.401 --> 14:27.269
'cause Tory's ready
to take his brutal saw disc

14:27.271 --> 14:28.903
for a spin.

14:31.740 --> 14:34.376
Dude, that looks like it worked great.

14:34.378 --> 14:36.344
All right, well, it cut through foam.

14:36.346 --> 14:37.612
I wonder what it's gonna do to a neck.

14:39.249 --> 14:43.651
Meanwhile, Kari's pondering
process is paying off, too.

14:43.653 --> 14:45.887
What I've come up here with now
is a kitchen knife

14:45.889 --> 14:47.756
on top of a saw blade that's at an angle,

14:47.758 --> 14:50.293
sort of like a traditional
French guillotine...

14:50.295 --> 14:53.195
two out of three headless
frenchmen say it's the best...

14:53.197 --> 14:55.331
that will work on either a spring load

14:55.333 --> 14:56.465
or a really good yank.

14:57.901 --> 14:59.969
To test the cigar cutter,

14:59.971 --> 15:02.071
Kari's rigged a rubber leg in a vise

15:02.073 --> 15:04.373
to see if she can get a clean cut.

15:04.375 --> 15:05.841
You ready?

15:05.843 --> 15:08.978
1, 2, 3.

15:08.980 --> 15:11.580
Okay, maybe not.

15:12.949 --> 15:15.951
Ah, it looks like
it worked pretty good to me.

15:15.953 --> 15:17.886
It just takes a few yanks.

15:17.888 --> 15:21.689
Finally, despite a near,
involuntary appendectomy...

15:21.691 --> 15:23.391
Aah!

15:23.393 --> 15:26.661
...Grant has persevered
with his beautifully designed

15:26.663 --> 15:30.164
but alarmingly heavy
five-bladed mechanism.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.567
Okay, keep your arms and legs
clear of the ride at all times.

15:32.569 --> 15:34.035
Here we go.

15:34.037 --> 15:37.440
In 3, 2, 1...

15:40.645 --> 15:42.979
I feel a little queasy, I got to say.

15:42.981 --> 15:44.281
Me too.

15:44.283 --> 15:47.217
Like a red-hot
guillotine through ice cream,

15:47.219 --> 15:52.223
the cantaloupe's no match for
Grant's fearsome fruit slicer.

15:55.661 --> 15:57.728
With the cutting component looking good

15:57.730 --> 15:59.730
for each of the three designs...

15:59.732 --> 16:02.366
Flying guillotine.

16:02.368 --> 16:04.835
...there's one thing left to sort out,

16:04.837 --> 16:07.437
the net to capture the head.

16:07.439 --> 16:10.173
I know this looks like a guillotine cap,

16:10.175 --> 16:12.209
but it's actually a salad bowl.

16:12.211 --> 16:14.412
That's right, death by salad bowl.

16:14.414 --> 16:17.749
So far, so good.

16:17.751 --> 16:21.687
Kari's concentrated on
decoration for decapitation.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.758
He looks like he's all dressed
up for a funeral... his own.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.493
Not to be outdone,

16:26.495 --> 16:31.164
Grant's final head-capture
feature is also very... catchy.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.466
I added this cage,

16:32.468 --> 16:36.069
which allows you to connect
all the pins together

16:36.071 --> 16:38.071
to this disc with a spring.

16:38.073 --> 16:43.243
You deploy the one spring that
fires all the blades at once,

16:43.245 --> 16:47.047
and then this cage also captures
the head for retrieval.

16:48.316 --> 16:49.650
It's done.

16:49.652 --> 16:51.185
I call it...

16:51.187 --> 16:52.954
"The Decapitron".

16:52.956 --> 16:56.390
Can these flying guillotine weapons

16:56.392 --> 16:58.426
cut it in the real world?

17:06.739 --> 17:10.009
Could the mythical,
Chinese flying guillotine

17:10.011 --> 17:11.444
have been a real assassins' weapon?

17:11.445 --> 17:12.712
Aah!

17:12.714 --> 17:15.348
What better place for Kari,
Grant, and Tory

17:15.349 --> 17:19.085
to test their own designs than
in a genuine, Chinese garden?

17:19.087 --> 17:20.953
I don't think we could have
picked a better environment.

17:20.954 --> 17:22.988
This is awesome.

17:22.990 --> 17:25.023
All right, now that we've
each designed and built

17:25.026 --> 17:26.392
our own flying guillotine,

17:26.394 --> 17:29.262
we are here at Bamboo Giant
to test three things

17:29.264 --> 17:30.997
in order to confirm this myth.

17:30.999 --> 17:32.532
First, its throwability.

17:32.534 --> 17:34.734
Second, can it decapitate a head?

17:34.736 --> 17:37.537
And if so, can it retrieve
the severed head?

17:37.539 --> 17:40.606
Up first is throwability testing.

17:40.608 --> 17:43.776
But with safety in mind,
the weapons won't be armed.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.413
This is our target.
We have a head on a stick.

17:47.415 --> 17:49.182
We're gonna see if we can actually land

17:49.184 --> 17:51.784
our flying guillotine
with accuracy and ease,

17:51.786 --> 17:54.253
and we're going to do it from
a distance of about 10 feet,

17:54.255 --> 17:56.088
which is about as far as you would be

17:56.090 --> 17:57.656
if you had to deploy your device.

17:57.658 --> 18:01.761
Each of the guys will take turns to throw.

18:01.763 --> 18:04.497
First up, it's Kari
with her designer cigar cutter.

18:04.499 --> 18:06.399
Okay. This is the throwing test.

18:06.401 --> 18:07.466
Ready?

18:07.468 --> 18:08.768
All right, we're looking for a ringer.

18:09.603 --> 18:11.871
The cigar cutter flies.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.774
Well, you got his feet.

18:14.776 --> 18:18.745
But on throw one,
it's way short of the mark.

18:18.747 --> 18:19.779
Grant's next.

18:19.781 --> 18:21.548
His unwieldy Decapitron's

18:21.550 --> 18:24.317
not exactly an aerodynamic masterpiece.

18:24.319 --> 18:28.622
My design... it weighs in
at a good seven or eight pounds.

18:28.624 --> 18:30.691
So, as a secondary weapon,

18:30.693 --> 18:33.493
I'm relying on blunt force trauma.

18:33.495 --> 18:36.997
Yep, and the first throw backs that up.

18:38.198 --> 18:40.066
Oh! Super close.

18:40.068 --> 18:41.935
That's another miss.

18:41.937 --> 18:44.571
So, it's Tory's turn.

18:44.573 --> 18:45.705
So, mine's pretty light,

18:45.707 --> 18:46.873
and it's kind of shaped like a frisbee.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.141
So it's gonna be easy to throw.

18:48.143 --> 18:49.475
Whether or not I can hit my target,

18:49.477 --> 18:50.610
that remains to be seen.

18:50.612 --> 18:52.612
All right, spinning salad bowl of death.

18:52.614 --> 18:53.913
You guys ready?

18:53.915 --> 18:55.047
Let's see it.

18:56.949 --> 18:59.017
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

18:59.019 --> 19:02.121
That's three throws and three nos,

19:02.123 --> 19:04.723
which isn't good news for the myth.

19:04.725 --> 19:07.193
Can Kari do better in round 2?

19:07.195 --> 19:08.461
Ready?

19:11.765 --> 19:13.699
Yeah!

19:13.701 --> 19:16.068
This time, she nails it.

19:17.437 --> 19:18.704
Good job.

19:18.706 --> 19:21.940
Not to be outdone,
Grant's beheading behemoth...

19:23.242 --> 19:24.242
Whoo!

19:24.244 --> 19:25.777
...scores a direct hit, too.

19:25.779 --> 19:27.278
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

19:27.280 --> 19:28.413
Nice!

19:28.415 --> 19:29.813
- You did it.
- You got it.

19:29.815 --> 19:30.848
That was awesome.

19:30.850 --> 19:33.117
Tory's second go.

19:33.119 --> 19:36.019
The salad bowl soars.

19:36.021 --> 19:37.054
Yeah!

19:37.056 --> 19:39.022
It's over.

19:39.024 --> 19:41.458
It's three for three
in the throwing stakes.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.628
The myth may still be alive.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.998
On the benchmark tests so far,

19:46.000 --> 19:49.201
they've all ticked the throwability box.

19:49.203 --> 19:51.637
Next, it's weapons cocked and loaded

19:51.639 --> 19:55.708
to see if their guillotines can
achieve a decent decapitation.

19:55.710 --> 19:58.844
This is where the metal
meets the mannequin.

19:58.846 --> 20:01.747
Their target is a pig's neck
married to a synthetic head.

20:01.749 --> 20:04.417
Mm, my favorite part of every show.

20:04.419 --> 20:06.552
It's very anatomically correct...

20:06.554 --> 20:07.653
Ohh!

20:07.655 --> 20:08.887
...if he could just keep his head on.

20:08.889 --> 20:10.922
Oh, it's even more
of a horror show than usual.

20:10.924 --> 20:14.159
They'll each get one shot at decapitation.

20:14.161 --> 20:15.793
This is my flying guillotine.

20:15.795 --> 20:18.262
It is based on the traditional guillotine.

20:18.264 --> 20:20.965
Now, they've been using
this sort of technology

20:20.967 --> 20:23.268
for hundreds of years to behead people,

20:23.270 --> 20:25.770
so I'm hoping
with a little bit of strength

20:25.772 --> 20:27.138
and a little quickness,

20:27.140 --> 20:29.675
I might actually be able
to pull a head off.

20:29.677 --> 20:31.243
Without the weight or acceleration

20:31.245 --> 20:32.311
of a traditional guillotine...

20:32.313 --> 20:34.147
- Okay, you guys ready?
- Yeah.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.716
...hers relies on brute pulling power.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.019
Ohh!

20:39.021 --> 20:40.286
Did it work?

20:40.288 --> 20:43.989
It looks like it cut a little
of the bone and the skin,

20:43.991 --> 20:45.391
but it more pulled the head off

20:45.393 --> 20:46.858
than really cut through the neck.

20:46.860 --> 20:48.293
Tory's right.

20:48.295 --> 20:50.995
It was, in fact, more
dislocation than decapitation.

20:50.997 --> 20:53.631
It cut trachea,
it cut a little of the skin,

20:53.633 --> 20:54.966
it cut a little of the bone,

20:54.968 --> 20:57.701
but it did not get a clean decapitation.

20:57.703 --> 21:00.770
Grant's deadly Decapitron is next.

21:00.772 --> 21:02.872
Mom, don't watch this part.

21:02.874 --> 21:06.242
This is definitely
the most dangerous part of it,

21:06.244 --> 21:10.881
which is arming the device
because it's all spring-loaded.

21:10.883 --> 21:12.149
If something goes wrong,

21:12.151 --> 21:14.217
it could actually fire
all the blades off at once

21:14.219 --> 21:15.985
while I'm holding it.

21:15.987 --> 21:18.354
With his hyperengineered Decapitron,

21:18.356 --> 21:21.391
Grant's design has a minor flaw.

21:21.393 --> 21:23.326
He has to pull vertically upward

21:23.328 --> 21:25.461
for his cable to release the blades.

21:25.463 --> 21:27.129
Gee, that thing might be
more dangerous for the thrower

21:27.131 --> 21:28.363
than the receiver.

21:28.365 --> 21:31.099
And that means he needs
a ladder to launch...

21:31.101 --> 21:33.134
Oh, that thing is insane.

21:33.136 --> 21:35.402
...hardly a handy assassin's weapon.

21:35.404 --> 21:37.238
Ready?

21:37.240 --> 21:39.607
3, 2, 1.

21:41.510 --> 21:43.345
Now, that's a pain in the neck.

21:43.347 --> 21:45.714
Oh, that looked cool.

21:45.716 --> 21:48.717
Despite being feared
by melons across the land,

21:48.719 --> 21:52.688
when it comes to necks,
it's only cut skin-deep.

21:52.690 --> 21:54.056
Not a clean decapitation.

21:54.058 --> 21:56.859
And that leaves
just Tory's salad bowl of death

21:56.861 --> 21:58.528
still on the menu.

21:58.530 --> 22:01.898
Not only is he a kung-fu master,
he is also a beekeeper.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.367
All right, ready to chop some heads?

22:04.369 --> 22:06.102
Where did you get a gong?

22:06.104 --> 22:08.304
We had one in the shop.

22:08.306 --> 22:09.906
Ooh! Fight!

22:09.908 --> 22:12.275
All right, here we go.
Flying guillotine in 3, 2, 1.

22:14.178 --> 22:16.012
Aah! Aah! Aah!

22:16.014 --> 22:17.380
Ew!

22:17.382 --> 22:20.116
That was gruesome!

22:20.118 --> 22:22.651
Gruesome, but impressive.

22:22.653 --> 22:24.520
God, look at that.
It cut through the bone.

22:24.522 --> 22:26.489
And the trachea
and the carotid artery

22:26.491 --> 22:29.625
and... wow... it did a lot
more damage than I expected.

22:29.627 --> 22:31.127
That is promising.

22:31.129 --> 22:33.896
And that means Tory's
is clearly the most promising

22:33.898 --> 22:35.097
of the three designs.

22:35.099 --> 22:38.401
It's light, it's sharp, and simple enough

22:38.403 --> 22:41.304
that it could have been built
in 1700s China.

22:43.174 --> 22:45.542
Oh, and what about
head retrieval, you ask?

22:45.544 --> 22:46.844
Simple.

22:46.846 --> 22:49.781
With no decapitation,
there can be no retrieval.

22:49.783 --> 22:51.449
That one's still to be tested.

22:57.409 --> 23:00.277
Part one of the C-4
cook-off myth is confirmed.

23:00.279 --> 23:03.614
C-4 can make a stable, reliable fuel.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.248
It's burning beautifully.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.017
So it's on to part two.

23:07.019 --> 23:10.286
If that flaming C-4
gets some sort of impact,

23:10.288 --> 23:14.157
will it lose its stability
and explode to kingdom come?

23:14.159 --> 23:16.893
An explosion is a chemical reaction,

23:16.895 --> 23:20.229
and heat tends to speed up
chemical reactions.

23:20.231 --> 23:23.366
So it makes sense that
if you're burning an explosive,

23:23.368 --> 23:25.469
it's gonna make it more sensitive.

23:25.471 --> 23:28.071
So, if we happen to be cooking with C-4

23:28.073 --> 23:31.508
and what we're cooking with
weighs, say, 7 1/2 pounds,

23:31.510 --> 23:35.046
and it drops on the burning C-4,
you might have a problem.

23:35.048 --> 23:36.280
With the heavy pot

23:36.282 --> 23:39.417
raised to a height of 3 feet
above the C-4,

23:39.419 --> 23:41.386
it will stop with the force
of 150 pounds.

23:41.388 --> 23:47.861
This is a full pot
dropped on flaming C-4 in 3...

23:47.863 --> 23:49.295
2...

23:49.297 --> 23:50.263
1, go.

23:53.668 --> 23:55.067
It just put it out.

23:55.069 --> 23:56.802
Well, you know what they say.

23:56.804 --> 23:58.570
A watched pot doesn't explode?

23:58.572 --> 24:00.505
No, a dropped pot doesn't explode.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.140
Thanks for ruining my joke.

24:02.142 --> 24:04.309
It seems that even alight,

24:04.311 --> 24:07.912
the C-4 is still too stable
for a seven-pound pot

24:07.914 --> 24:09.080
to prompt an explosion.

24:09.082 --> 24:10.381
Well, the myth is

24:10.383 --> 24:12.884
that a pot dropped on flaming
C-4 will make it go off,

24:12.886 --> 24:15.720
and we got a perfect landing,
no explosion.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.823
Not even... I don't even see the C-4.

24:17.825 --> 24:19.558
Oh, wait a second.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.660
There it is. No explosion at all.

24:21.662 --> 24:24.130
Right now, it's not looking
very good for the myth.

24:25.866 --> 24:27.300
Well, that didn't work. What's next?

24:27.302 --> 24:28.702
Well, I've heard two parts to this.

24:28.704 --> 24:30.804
One is that you shouldn't drop
a pot on the flaming C-4,

24:30.806 --> 24:33.974
but the other is that you
shouldn't try and stamp it out.

24:33.976 --> 24:35.375
Stomping on burning C-4?

24:35.377 --> 24:37.144
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

24:37.146 --> 24:38.912
You can do that if you want.

24:38.914 --> 24:40.680
Well, thanks, but no thanks.

24:40.682 --> 24:43.116
I've actually worked on the perfect thing.

24:43.118 --> 24:45.986
Editors, roll the montage
of my robot stomper build.

24:47.688 --> 24:49.990
Okay, here's what Adam made earlier...

24:52.793 --> 24:54.194
Ow!

24:54.196 --> 24:56.895
...a pneumatically powered stomping robot.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.900
I think he's ready for prime time.

25:01.902 --> 25:04.703
He certainly is.

25:04.705 --> 25:06.771
There we go. I'm powering up the man.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.208
Perfect.

25:10.210 --> 25:12.009
Now, for the second impact test

25:12.011 --> 25:15.279
with Adam's robot
designed to accurately replicate

25:15.281 --> 25:17.281
the force of a human stomp.

25:17.283 --> 25:21.518
Will that set off an explosion
when it hits the burning C-4?

25:21.520 --> 25:24.521
Make it like a nice, toasty marshmallow.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.624
And then step two is to fire up robo-stomp.

25:28.626 --> 25:31.227
In 3, 2, 1... stomp!

25:32.162 --> 25:33.229
Ha! Perfect.

25:33.231 --> 25:34.997
Oh! It's on his shoe!

25:34.999 --> 25:39.936
Despite the impact of
robo-stomp's pneumatic foot...

25:42.240 --> 25:46.277
...the burning C-4 is still
too stable to explode.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.645
Look, you don't get much more real-world

25:47.647 --> 25:49.681
than dropping a cooking pot

25:49.683 --> 25:52.517
or stomping on the burning C-4
and nothing happens.

25:52.519 --> 25:53.952
It's just too stable.

25:53.954 --> 25:57.022
Clearly, we're gonna have
to go to some ridiculous lengths

25:57.024 --> 25:59.058
to get this stuff to blow up.

25:59.060 --> 26:00.693
Exactly.

26:00.695 --> 26:03.930
So, did someone mention
dropping a really heavy object?

26:03.932 --> 26:05.565
So, why the anvil?

26:05.567 --> 26:07.467
Well, this testing is all about determining

26:07.469 --> 26:09.302
how shock-sensitive C-4 is.

26:09.304 --> 26:11.004
When we drop this anvil,

26:11.006 --> 26:14.642
we're looking at something like
1,500 pounds per square inch

26:14.644 --> 26:16.844
being exerted on that C-4.

26:16.846 --> 26:18.312
And that's quite an impact.

26:18.314 --> 26:21.415
And if that doesn't do it,
that says a lot about the myth.

26:21.417 --> 26:22.750
Indeed it does

26:22.752 --> 26:26.387
because the anvil
tops the scales at 90 pounds.

26:26.389 --> 26:28.089
Looks like we have ignition.

26:28.091 --> 26:31.926
Flaming C-4 with an anvil
dropped on it in 3...

26:31.928 --> 26:33.160
2...1...

26:33.162 --> 26:34.128
Go!

26:34.930 --> 26:36.264
Oh!

26:37.367 --> 26:39.967
Perfect landing. Nice work.

26:39.969 --> 26:41.569
And no explosion.

26:41.571 --> 26:43.871
I don't know what's gonna
blow this stuff up.

26:43.873 --> 26:46.506
We've burned it, we've smashed it,

26:46.508 --> 26:48.141
we've smashed it and burned it.

26:48.143 --> 26:50.477
I don't know what else to do to it.

26:50.479 --> 26:52.246
Let's shoot it with guns.

26:52.248 --> 26:53.981
Sure. Why not?

26:59.255 --> 27:00.422
Back from testing,

27:00.424 --> 27:02.957
it's clear that of the three prototypes,

27:02.959 --> 27:04.292
Tory's flying guillotine

27:04.294 --> 27:07.562
came closest to completing a decapitation.

27:07.564 --> 27:10.399
Halfway through the bone!
That is promising!

27:10.401 --> 27:14.103
But since close is not
close enough to prove the myth,

27:14.105 --> 27:17.639
it's time to refine his design.

27:17.641 --> 27:20.074
Okay, so, we've left the bamboo forest

27:20.076 --> 27:23.477
and we're back at our... Chinese palace.

27:23.479 --> 27:24.845
We have one more test to do.

27:24.847 --> 27:26.946
We want to see if we can actually achieve

27:26.948 --> 27:31.050
a full decapitation... a throw,
slice, capture, retrieve...

27:31.052 --> 27:33.887
'cause, ultimately, we want to find
out if this myth is plausible.

27:33.889 --> 27:36.823
Tory's prototype...
the salad bowl of death...

27:36.825 --> 27:39.926
slices as it spins against the neck.

27:39.928 --> 27:42.962
Can he improve it
to sever a head completely?

27:42.964 --> 27:44.998
One thing that I noticed on my guillotine

27:45.000 --> 27:47.734
is that it cut halfway
through the neck bone.

27:47.736 --> 27:50.937
I think it's because I have a
straight edge on my guillotine.

27:50.939 --> 27:53.106
So what I'm thinking
is if I give it a saw edge,

27:53.108 --> 27:54.374
cut grooves in the blade,

27:54.376 --> 27:56.309
it'll help me cut through that bone.

27:56.311 --> 27:57.777
Hopefully this will give me
that advantage

27:57.779 --> 28:00.413
to get a clean decapitation.

28:00.415 --> 28:02.516
To increase
the cutting power even further,

28:02.518 --> 28:04.951
he's also lengthened the pulling cable.

28:04.953 --> 28:07.621
That way, I have
the guillotine spinning longer,

28:07.623 --> 28:10.424
and hopefully that will give me
more cutting power

28:10.426 --> 28:11.858
to get through that neck.

28:11.860 --> 28:14.494
And if they can achieve a beheading,

28:14.496 --> 28:18.032
the final hurdle is to see
if they can retrieve the head.

28:18.034 --> 28:21.502
So Tory's attached a see-through
net to do just that.

28:21.504 --> 28:22.903
All right, so I added this

28:22.905 --> 28:25.139
not because I want him to be a beekeeper,

28:25.141 --> 28:28.342
but that way I can see the head
get cut off as it's happening.

28:28.344 --> 28:32.179
No stranger to danger, poor,
old Buster steps up one more time.

28:32.181 --> 28:33.280
Chin up, buddy.

28:33.282 --> 28:35.983
It's gonna be over before you know it.

28:35.985 --> 28:38.184
And they're set to test.

28:38.186 --> 28:39.686
All right, so, I made the adjustments

28:39.688 --> 28:40.753
to my guillotine.

28:40.755 --> 28:42.188
It's time to see if it'll cut a head off.

28:42.190 --> 28:44.223
Okay, we have the exact same
circumstances as before.

28:44.225 --> 28:48.093
Yeah, we've got a same diameter
neck, same distance.

28:48.095 --> 28:49.094
We're ready to go.

28:49.096 --> 28:50.529
All right. Let's do it.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.100
Like a mythical, martial-arts master...

28:57.170 --> 28:59.472
Tory takes the head clean off.

28:59.474 --> 29:02.976
And it's in the bag, literally,
on just the first go.

29:02.978 --> 29:04.344
- Ohh!
- We got it!

29:04.346 --> 29:07.647
Look. His head's in the bag.

29:07.649 --> 29:09.750
It's a major achievement,

29:09.752 --> 29:12.018
and it means Tory's improved design

29:12.020 --> 29:14.354
has now met all three benchmarks

29:14.356 --> 29:16.022
for the flying guillotine.

29:16.024 --> 29:18.958
That gory success
could mean only one thing.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.262
There really could be something
to this myth.

29:22.264 --> 29:24.264
- You guys, that was amazing.
- I know.

29:24.266 --> 29:27.000
Not only did we create
a real flying guillotine

29:27.002 --> 29:28.101
from scratch,

29:28.103 --> 29:30.303
but we achieved all the criteria
for the myth.

29:30.305 --> 29:31.972
Yeah, I mean, we landed it on the head,

29:31.974 --> 29:32.973
decapitate the guy,

29:32.975 --> 29:34.374
and retrieve the head in the net.

29:34.376 --> 29:36.510
Yeah, we proved it on a basic level

29:36.512 --> 29:37.878
against a static enemy,

29:37.880 --> 29:39.980
but I don't think anybody's
gonna be holding still

29:39.982 --> 29:42.449
in a real, live combat situation.

29:42.451 --> 29:44.518
- What do you have in mind?
- I have a few ideas.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.319
Oh, this should be interesting.

29:46.321 --> 29:48.654
Coming up in "cooking with C-4"...

29:48.656 --> 29:50.589
Kind of makes you shaky
when you're nervous.

29:51.125 --> 29:55.228
And Tory's flying guillotine
gets put to the ultimate test.

29:55.230 --> 29:56.896
There's a guy behind you!

30:02.905 --> 30:07.710
So far, impact has failed
to get burning C-4 to explode.

30:07.712 --> 30:09.812
But is that all about to change?

30:09.814 --> 30:13.349
So, we dropped an anvil
on the C-4, nothing happened.

30:13.351 --> 30:14.550
Blunt force doesn't work.

30:15.986 --> 30:18.587
The only other thing that I can think of

30:18.589 --> 30:21.623
that is a really hard,
fast impact on something,

30:21.625 --> 30:24.226
short of another explosive, is a bullet.

30:25.462 --> 30:27.229
So, that's what we're gonna do.

30:27.231 --> 30:30.199
We're gonna fire a speeding
bullet into burning C-4.

30:30.201 --> 30:34.269
Will that high impact
be enough to cause an explosion?

30:34.271 --> 30:36.204
The first bullet we'll be firing with is...

30:36.206 --> 30:39.574
your basic .308 caliber sniper round.

30:39.576 --> 30:40.875
It's a 7.62 NATO,

30:40.877 --> 30:44.513
and it flies through the air
at 2,600 feet per second.

30:44.515 --> 30:46.548
That bullet at that speed

30:46.550 --> 30:49.151
will give a staggering force
on the burning C-4

30:49.153 --> 30:51.620
of about 25,000 pounds.

30:51.622 --> 30:53.054
Oh, she's going pretty good.

30:53.056 --> 30:55.658
All right, I am gonna fire.

30:55.660 --> 30:58.694
This is shooting a regular bullet

30:58.696 --> 31:00.929
at a flaming ball of C-4.

31:03.567 --> 31:05.268
- Oh, I think you missed.
- I missed.

31:05.270 --> 31:07.070
All right, let's try that again.

31:07.072 --> 31:09.006
And with a few words of encouragement

31:09.008 --> 31:11.008
from the peanut gallery...

31:11.010 --> 31:12.944
You're not nervous about
making the shot, are you?

31:12.946 --> 31:14.846
- Like, you might miss, huh?
- No.

31:14.848 --> 31:16.614
- Not at all?
- Nope.

31:16.616 --> 31:19.550
Kind of makes you shaky
when you're nervous.

31:19.552 --> 31:21.719
All right, I think I'm ready to go.

31:21.721 --> 31:22.920
Safety's off.

31:22.922 --> 31:23.921
Don't miss.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.122
I'm not gonna miss.

31:25.124 --> 31:27.057
Shooting a flaming ball of C-4

31:27.059 --> 31:28.592
with a regular, old bullet.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.963
Damn it. It looks like I missed it.

31:32.965 --> 31:36.933
So, with the score at C-4, 2, Adam, zip,

31:36.935 --> 31:41.271
and Jamie too gun-shy to take
a shot, the guys turn to a pro.

31:41.273 --> 31:43.940
I'm an okay shot.
Not a great shot. I'm okay.

31:43.942 --> 31:46.475
I missed my first shot,
nicked the second.

31:46.477 --> 31:49.178
What we're about to do
is hand over responsibility

31:49.180 --> 31:50.579
for the shooting in this story

31:50.581 --> 31:53.082
to sergeant Dan Powell,
whose gun this is.

31:53.084 --> 31:56.618
Hopefully he'll make the shots
much better than we could.

31:56.620 --> 31:59.755
Sergeant "Dead Shot" Dan
nails the target on his first shot.

31:59.757 --> 32:03.926
The burning C-4 bounces,
but a big boom there ain't.

32:03.928 --> 32:06.662
Well, there you have it.

32:06.664 --> 32:10.901
A normal bullet did not cause
burning C-4 to explode.

32:10.903 --> 32:13.704
The next bullet we'll be firing
with is this... a tracer round.

32:13.706 --> 32:15.605
It's got a bit of phosphorus in its base

32:15.607 --> 32:19.443
that allows the shooter to see
the path the bullet takes.

32:19.445 --> 32:22.613
It also flies through the air
at 2,600 feet per second.

32:22.615 --> 32:26.384
A bullet striking
with a force of 25,000 pounds

32:26.386 --> 32:28.553
plus added heat
from the burning phosphorus

32:28.555 --> 32:31.557
means it's going to hit hard and hot.

32:31.559 --> 32:32.958
You may fire when ready.

32:35.128 --> 32:36.361
Oh!

32:36.363 --> 32:39.998
That was a direct hit. No explosion.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.567
Once again, the bullet
impacts the C-4, but...

32:43.569 --> 32:45.636
Nothing.

32:45.638 --> 32:49.273
Two bullets down and still no detonation.

32:49.275 --> 32:52.910
The last round we'll be firing
is this... an incendiary round.

32:52.912 --> 32:56.547
Inside is magnesium aluminum
alloy and barium nitrate,

32:56.549 --> 32:58.883
which ignite upon extreme impact.

32:58.885 --> 33:01.352
You see where I'm going with this?

33:01.354 --> 33:03.889
It's down to this shot.

33:03.891 --> 33:06.525
Can the impact of a high-explosive bullet

33:06.527 --> 33:08.494
finally make the difference
to our burning C-4

33:08.496 --> 33:11.731
and make it go boom?

33:11.733 --> 33:12.965
All right, fire at will.

33:16.237 --> 33:17.236
Nice!

33:17.238 --> 33:19.738
That was beautiful!

33:19.740 --> 33:23.975
Nice shot. No explosion.

33:25.077 --> 33:27.178
Really? No explosion?

33:27.180 --> 33:29.347
I know what you're saying.

33:29.349 --> 33:31.482
You're saying,
"wait a minute, MythBusters".

33:31.484 --> 33:32.850
"I see the bullet hit flaming C-4"

33:32.852 --> 33:34.851
"and I see what looks like an explosion".

33:34.853 --> 33:38.756
But it's an incendiary round.
That's what it's meant to do.

33:38.758 --> 33:40.658
In order not to confuse you,

33:40.660 --> 33:43.061
we filmed this high-speed footage

33:43.063 --> 33:46.665
of that same type of round
hitting a blank metal plate.

33:49.937 --> 33:51.771
I think that makes the point
nicely, don't you?

33:51.773 --> 33:53.207
It does.

33:53.209 --> 33:56.143
The explosive round may have exploded,

33:56.145 --> 33:58.978
but the blazing C-4 did not blow up.

33:58.980 --> 34:01.314
The bullets won't detonate flaming C-4.

34:01.316 --> 34:03.482
Nope. We got to come up
with something else.

34:03.484 --> 34:04.650
We do.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here

34:13.192 --> 34:14.893
The MythBusters have proved

34:14.895 --> 34:16.594
their flying-guillotine design works,

34:16.596 --> 34:19.464
but only against a stationary victim.

34:19.466 --> 34:21.199
Look! Head's in the bag!

34:21.201 --> 34:24.768
Now they're taking it to the max
by testing it in combat

34:24.771 --> 34:27.304
and that means against an opponent...

34:27.306 --> 34:30.175
a scarier, more real-life opponent

34:30.177 --> 34:31.476
because this time...

34:31.478 --> 34:32.712
He moves!

34:32.714 --> 34:35.081
Just like any other
real-life battle scenario,

34:35.083 --> 34:38.684
your opponent is gonna be moving
around to avoid the weapon.

34:38.686 --> 34:40.252
And this guy is no exception.

34:40.254 --> 34:43.554
He's got a mobile robotic base
that we can control remotely.

34:43.556 --> 34:45.356
Try and hit me. Huh? Oh, oh.

34:47.257 --> 34:49.659
That's not the only thing
we have in store for Tory.

34:50.962 --> 34:54.465
An assassin lurking in the shadows.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.933
This one's actually...

34:56.935 --> 35:00.304
So Tory's up against
a moving robotic enemy in front

35:00.306 --> 35:04.574
and a sneaky foe who can pop up
any moment from behind.

35:04.576 --> 35:06.843
The ultimate real-world test.

35:06.845 --> 35:08.278
All right, now what do I need to do

35:08.280 --> 35:09.546
to beat this obstacle course?

35:09.548 --> 35:10.781
Okay, you have two minutes on the clock

35:10.783 --> 35:12.916
to defeat two enemies.

35:12.918 --> 35:14.685
You have to stay behind this line,

35:14.687 --> 35:16.520
and your target is gonna be moving.

35:16.522 --> 35:18.723
Normally there's no rules
in battle, but all right.

35:18.725 --> 35:19.657
Let's do it.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.894
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:23.896 --> 35:26.697
in the grand palace of emperor Yongzheng,

35:26.699 --> 35:29.600
known in some circles
as "the M7 workshop,"

35:29.602 --> 35:32.403
we have the famous kung-fu killer,

35:32.405 --> 35:37.842
the master of disaster... Tory Belleci.

35:37.844 --> 35:42.846
And his shadowy, evil
opponent... the Fa Jin king.

35:42.848 --> 35:46.250
You ready? Let's do this.

35:46.252 --> 35:50.987
Honor and myth all hang
on the next two minutes.

35:50.989 --> 35:57.662
Flying guillotine in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

35:59.998 --> 36:01.899
Right from the outset,

36:01.901 --> 36:04.101
the robo-target's proving very elusive.

36:04.103 --> 36:08.806
It's a far cry from the original
static assassin test.

36:08.808 --> 36:09.807
Oh, my God.

36:09.809 --> 36:12.242
This is like some crazy, weird nightmare.

36:12.244 --> 36:14.210
And then suddenly...

36:14.212 --> 36:15.578
There's a guy behind you!

36:15.580 --> 36:18.580
...there's that sneaky assassin
to contend with, as well.

36:18.582 --> 36:19.982
But he doesn't last long.

36:19.984 --> 36:21.583
You got him!

36:21.585 --> 36:24.486
He wasn't decapitated,
but he was at least disarmed.

36:24.488 --> 36:26.854
Then it's back to the main target.

36:26.856 --> 36:30.524
But before you can say
"guillotine", time's up.

36:30.526 --> 36:33.260
3, 2, 1!

36:33.262 --> 36:38.165
Two minutes are up without
a single decapitation.

36:38.167 --> 36:40.334
But at least there was one knockout blow.

36:40.336 --> 36:42.570
It's pretty hard hitting a moving target.

36:42.572 --> 36:43.671
It looked hard,

36:43.673 --> 36:45.674
but, hey, you got the one that popped up.

36:45.676 --> 36:47.375
Your reaction time was great.

36:47.377 --> 36:48.477
Yeah, you definitely

36:48.479 --> 36:50.679
knocked out the assassin
from the shadows.

36:51.948 --> 36:53.215
That was so much fun.

36:53.217 --> 36:55.284
I mean, this was like
living out my fantasies...

36:55.286 --> 36:56.419
having two attackers coming at me,

36:56.421 --> 36:57.954
trying to take them down.

36:57.956 --> 37:02.091
However, trying to hit a moving
target, it's almost impossible.

37:02.093 --> 37:04.727
This weapon has proved
plausible as an assassination device,

37:04.729 --> 37:08.464
but no match for a foe in pitch battle,

37:08.466 --> 37:12.568
so before we can sign this myth
to the dusty vault of history,

37:12.570 --> 37:15.137
let's leave the final word to Grant.

37:15.139 --> 37:17.606
Despite that this guy
looks like he's been defeated,

37:17.608 --> 37:20.743
he actually survived
and not only that, he won

37:20.745 --> 37:23.546
because it's so difficult
to deploy the flying guillotine

37:23.548 --> 37:26.282
in a combat situation.

37:26.284 --> 37:30.587
Definitely this is plausible
as an assassin's weapon,

37:30.589 --> 37:33.090
but in combat, no way.

37:38.230 --> 37:39.597
On the other side of the break,

37:39.599 --> 37:42.899
it's time for C-4 to sizzle,
"MythBusters" style.

37:42.901 --> 37:46.402
There it goes...
pouring right onto the C-4.

37:51.668 --> 37:54.804
Adam and Jamie have gone all out

37:54.806 --> 37:57.073
testing the two-pronged military myth

37:57.075 --> 38:00.543
that burning C-4 to cook with is safe...

38:00.545 --> 38:01.778
It's burning beautifully.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.947
It's not bad, but it's not hot.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.583
...so long as you don't bash it
while it's alight.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.418
To test that,

38:08.420 --> 38:11.588
- they tried dropping heavy objects on it...
- Oh!

38:11.590 --> 38:14.091
...they tried shooting it
with high-impact bullets...

38:14.859 --> 38:16.193
Nice!

38:16.195 --> 38:18.228
Nice shot. No explosion.

38:18.230 --> 38:22.265
...but nothing's detonated the burning C-4.

38:23.501 --> 38:26.669
So in a last-ditch attempt
to cause it to explode,

38:26.671 --> 38:28.938
they're ramping it up to the max.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.473
Time to mix some thermite.

38:32.277 --> 38:35.880
Thermite... that
high-intensity, extreme-heat material

38:35.882 --> 38:38.983
that can cause explosive reactions.

38:38.985 --> 38:40.784
Wow!

38:40.786 --> 38:44.721
If anything's gonna super-heat
the molecules in C-4

38:44.723 --> 38:47.990
enough to set it off, then it's thermite.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.359
Thermite is a mixture
of two different metal powders.

38:50.361 --> 38:52.861
One is the fuel,
the other is the oxidizer.

38:52.863 --> 38:56.264
Usually, that would be aluminum
and iron oxide.

38:56.266 --> 38:59.233
Now, when they're mixed together
and ignited,

38:59.235 --> 39:01.269
they burn with extremely
high temperatures...

39:01.271 --> 39:04.071
about 4,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

39:04.073 --> 39:05.906
They've proved that C-4

39:05.908 --> 39:09.644
burning at just over
1,000 degrees won't explode,

39:09.646 --> 39:12.814
but what about at 4,500 degrees?

39:12.816 --> 39:15.850
Here's how our rig
is going to theoretically work.

39:15.852 --> 39:18.019
Up on the stand,
I've got a massive flower pot

39:18.021 --> 39:20.088
filled with about three gallons
of thermite.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.057
It will be ignited
by a neon transformer...

39:22.059 --> 39:23.792
the wires of which are right here.

39:23.794 --> 39:25.961
Once ignited,
that thermite will start to burn

39:25.963 --> 39:27.162
and it will start to drip.

39:27.164 --> 39:28.464
Where you ask?

39:28.466 --> 39:30.933
Well, through the bottom
of this flower pot, of course.

39:30.935 --> 39:32.869
The molten thermite will drip through
the bottom of this flower pot,

39:32.871 --> 39:34.471
right onto our C-4.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.638
We, of course,

39:35.640 --> 39:38.275
will be waiting safely behind
the blast panels

39:38.277 --> 39:41.878
to see if the thermite
makes the C-4 go boom.

39:44.515 --> 39:45.648
Give me the C-4.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.883
There we... ooh, ooh, ooh.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.885
- Don't drop it.
- I won't.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.119
Here we go.

39:51.121 --> 39:52.387
So it'll be thermite

39:52.389 --> 39:55.791
burning at a super-hot 4,500 degrees

39:55.793 --> 39:59.661
pouring directly
on to the C-4 beneath it.

39:59.663 --> 40:01.329
Call it whenever you're ready.

40:01.331 --> 40:04.599
Okay, molten thermite dripping on to C-4.

40:04.601 --> 40:07.569
In 3, 2, 1, go!

40:09.205 --> 40:11.873
Oh, it's lighting beautifully.

40:11.875 --> 40:15.911
At 4,500 degrees, thermite burns
with blinding intensity.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.913
There it goes...
pouring right onto the C-4.

40:18.915 --> 40:21.082
It's a perfect hit.

40:21.084 --> 40:24.218
It's just behaving exactly like we wanted.

40:24.220 --> 40:27.220
In spite of the
extreme heat, there's no boom.

40:27.222 --> 40:29.356
I can't think of anything else.

40:29.358 --> 40:32.425
It's like you're not setting off
C-4 by accident.

40:32.427 --> 40:33.692
That's all there is to it.

40:33.694 --> 40:35.194
I think that's all there is to it.

40:35.196 --> 40:37.062
I think we've really done
everything we can.

40:37.064 --> 40:39.131
Pretty much.

40:39.133 --> 40:43.036
Even when subjected
to 4,500 degrees of pure heat,

40:43.038 --> 40:45.605
the C-4 keeps its cool.

40:45.607 --> 40:47.841
So, after all this testing,

40:47.843 --> 40:52.146
what exactly will make C-4 go boom?

40:52.148 --> 40:55.083
Well, the explosive in C-4 is RDX,

40:55.085 --> 40:58.721
and you need a blasting cap
to set off RDX.

40:58.723 --> 41:00.923
The mercury fulminate in a blasting cap

41:00.925 --> 41:03.493
moves really fast when it goes off.

41:03.495 --> 41:06.530
It's something like
100,000 feet per second.

41:06.532 --> 41:11.468
That's over Mach 100,
which is really, really fast.

41:11.470 --> 41:14.738
And we just can't achieve
those kinds of speeds

41:14.740 --> 41:17.507
with anything short of a blasting cap.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.509
C-4 was designed specifically

41:19.511 --> 41:22.980
to be a high explosive
that was incredibly stable.

41:22.982 --> 41:24.281
And I got to give it up.

41:24.283 --> 41:26.750
It is more stable
than I ever thought possible.

41:26.752 --> 41:29.787
So with the C-4
scientific certainty sewn up,

41:29.789 --> 41:31.589
there's just one thing left to do.

41:31.591 --> 41:32.990
Shall we call this?

41:32.992 --> 41:34.258
I think it's time.

41:34.260 --> 41:35.426
All right.

41:35.428 --> 41:37.862
On the first count
that C-4 can be ignited

41:37.864 --> 41:40.399
and heat your lunch, how do you find?

41:40.401 --> 41:42.233
I find that confirmed.

41:42.235 --> 41:45.203
On the second count that said flaming C-4

41:45.205 --> 41:47.705
should not be trod upon or dropped upon,

41:47.707 --> 41:49.074
how do you find?

41:49.076 --> 41:50.609
I find that busted.

41:50.611 --> 41:51.877
I love it.

41:51.879 --> 41:53.812
It's both busted and confirmed
at the same time.

41:53.814 --> 41:55.815
- Let's go back to the shop.
- Okay.

41:55.817 --> 41:58.450
You know, in spite of the evidence,

41:58.452 --> 42:01.187
I just wouldn't stomp on that stuff.

42:01.189 --> 42:02.755
No. Neither would I.
