01:00.160 --> 01:03.186
The Mifulu represent
a fascinating example

01:03.229 --> 01:06.096
of failed culture.
The people of the Mifulu

01:06.132 --> 01:08.794
communicated
entirely in rhyme,

01:08.835 --> 01:11.633
although that's actually
less impressive than it sounds,

01:11.671 --> 01:15.266
because their language
only contained one vowel.

01:15.308 --> 01:17.276
Also, if you've
noticed,

01:17.310 --> 01:19.540
the only artifacts
we've been able to unearth

01:19.579 --> 01:21.513
are primitive musical
instruments.

01:21.548 --> 01:24.278
The Mifulus had
plenty of drums,

01:24.317 --> 01:26.285
guitars, harmonicas
and the like,

01:26.319 --> 01:29.311
but no weapons
or tools.

01:29.355 --> 01:33.519
So, in essence,
they had rhythm, they had music,

01:33.560 --> 01:36.051
but they had no
hammers and spears,

01:36.096 --> 01:38.064
so they died.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.033
In any case, this brings us
to the final room of the tour

01:41.067 --> 01:43.695
and my personal
favorite--

01:43.736 --> 01:46.364
The Hall
of Norse Mythology.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.209
This is Odin,

01:50.243 --> 01:53.212
chief divinity of the entire
Norse pantheon--

01:53.246 --> 01:55.214
"The Allfather"
as he's called--

01:55.248 --> 01:58.274
and these paintings depict
some of Odin's many sons.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.377
That is Thor,
God of Thunder,

02:00.420 --> 02:02.388
with his mighty hammer.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.652
And this is Balder,
God of Beauty.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.454
Who's that ugly guy?

02:06.493 --> 02:08.620
Oh, I was just
about to get to him.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.026
That's Loki,
Norse God of Mischief.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.396
He was also known
as "The Trickster."

02:13.433 --> 02:16.402
As the youngest
son of Odin,

02:16.436 --> 02:19.337
Loki was the black sheep
of the Norse mythological family.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.340
His constant
mischievous pranks

02:21.374 --> 02:23.342
were an endless source
of embarrassment

02:23.376 --> 02:25.344
to his father
and his siblings.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.608
He was, in other words,
a bratty little brother.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.209
And Loki's ultimate tool
of mischief was this,

02:32.252 --> 02:34.652
the mask
which he created

02:34.687 --> 02:36.814
and tossed down to earth
thousands of years ago

02:36.856 --> 02:40.087
to create mayhem among the mortals.
For, according to legend,

02:40.126 --> 02:43.926
the wearer of the mask is imbued
with the powers of Loki himself.

02:43.963 --> 02:46.261
- Is that true?
- No, of course not.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.824
If it were, I'd be
wearing it myself.

02:48.868 --> 02:51.598
No, no, it's textbook
mythical allegory.

02:51.638 --> 02:53.606
Loki represents
the "id,"

02:53.640 --> 02:55.608
the suppressed parts
of ourselves,

02:55.642 --> 02:57.837
and the mask is the tool
which unleashes the id.

02:57.877 --> 03:01.369
I go into this very topic
in my critically acclaimed book.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.712
Now, of all
the Aesir gods--

03:03.750 --> 03:07.242
excuse me, sir.
Please don't touch the mask display.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.084
Of all the Aesir gods,

03:09.122 --> 03:11.181
Loki was the only one
who could shape shift--

03:11.224 --> 03:14.489
change his form,
even turn himself into a woman.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.462
A woman?! Man alive,
lock up your sons and daughters

03:17.497 --> 03:20.694
around that twisted
piece of fruitcake, hey, Doc?

03:20.733 --> 03:23.361
Well, I guess that's
one way of putting it.

03:23.403 --> 03:26.964
Anyway, Loki brought nothing
but shame to Odin and his ilk.

03:27.006 --> 03:30.373
In fact, Loki was
such an unruly child

03:30.410 --> 03:32.469
that Odin ultimately
locked him up in chains

03:32.512 --> 03:34.207
far beneath the earth.

03:34.247 --> 03:37.444
He did not!

04:00.139 --> 04:03.905
- Good God!
- And don't you forget it!

04:08.715 --> 04:11.684
Apparently, you do not
agree with my theories.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.514
Finally!

04:20.692 --> 04:23.787
- This is a fake!
- Yes, but it's a good fake.

04:25.131 --> 04:28.532
Ow. Sir, that
is museum property.

04:28.568 --> 04:33.164
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me replace it.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.504
What-- what are--
what are you doing?

04:35.541 --> 04:38.840
Perhaps I should inform you
I suffer from vertigo

04:38.878 --> 04:42.006
and I have a lawyer.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.675
Hello?

04:45.418 --> 04:47.386
Where's my body?
Come get me.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.911
- Yeah. Oh yeah.
- Hold it right there!

04:59.966 --> 05:01.228
I don't like it here.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.472
Thanks for dropping by.

05:06.506 --> 05:08.599
- Dropping?
- Bye.

05:16.049 --> 05:19.041
Where's... my...

05:19.085 --> 05:21.076
mask?!

06:12.805 --> 06:15.103
Who's a happy baby?

06:15.141 --> 06:18.599
Who's a happy baby?

06:18.644 --> 06:21.442
Aw, Clare, he's amazing.
Honey, look at him.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.915
They said he's very
alert for his age.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.850
He's going to be
a genius

06:25.885 --> 06:27.910
just like his brothers
and sisters.

06:27.954 --> 06:31.355
Little Tommy's starting
Junior Mensa next week...

06:31.391 --> 06:33.951
and Clancy just took
his first potty poop.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.018
Oh, look. Honey, he just
took his first poop.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.223
Good poop, Clancy!

06:41.734 --> 06:43.929
Whoa, Captain Underpants,

06:43.970 --> 06:46.438
watch your aim.
He's gonna need those.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.963
- You okay?
- Yup.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.805
Here. Mm-hmm.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.679
So, when are you two gonna have
one for yourselves?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.812
Oh...

07:00.987 --> 07:03.387
It's a boy.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.555
And a girl!

07:06.592 --> 07:10.426
- Twins?
- And another boy!

07:10.463 --> 07:12.431
- Girl.
- Boy.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.433
- Girl.
- Boy.

07:14.467 --> 07:17.197
Girl, boy, girl, boy...

07:21.641 --> 07:23.609
Tim!

07:25.645 --> 07:27.306
Whew.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.644
Okay, I'm just
gonna say it.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.479
That was flat out
embarrassing.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.951
The mere mention
of the word "baby" and your throat

07:33.986 --> 07:35.681
seizes up like
you swallowed Drano.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.484
After seeing those kids,

07:37.523 --> 07:39.582
Drano sounds like
a good option.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.788
- Honey, just think...
- Yeah?

07:43.830 --> 07:47.095
If we have a baby, you'll have someone
you can play video games with.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.623
Mm-hmm.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.634
- Hey!
- You'll have someone you can relate to.

07:53.673 --> 07:56.938
Okay, honey, look.
I know you're upset, okay?

07:56.976 --> 07:59.672
- But can I ask you one question?
- What?

08:01.047 --> 08:03.277
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.045
Tim, stop it.
I mean it.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.518
Look, babe,
who's a turkey?

08:07.553 --> 08:09.521
Bawk bawk bawk
bawk bawk!

08:09.555 --> 08:12.456
- I'm serious!
- Who's a rabid dog?

08:14.694 --> 08:16.685
Ow!

08:20.233 --> 08:22.463
- Who's Hannibal the Cannibal?
- Stop it.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.867
Jeez, babe.

08:23.903 --> 08:25.700
Okay, I'm driving--
driving-- driving here!

08:33.513 --> 08:35.241
- Ugh.
- Honey, slow down.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.681
You know I can't run and apologize
at the same time.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.982
Come on, Tonya. I'm not saying
I don't want to have a baby.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.580
I'm just saying I don't want to have
a baby right now.

08:43.623 --> 08:47.059
So why not?
Why not now?

08:48.060 --> 08:50.119
- Because.
- Ugh.

08:50.162 --> 08:52.130
Wha-- babe!

08:52.164 --> 08:54.928
Tonya!
Ton-ton--

08:58.304 --> 09:01.034
Hey, Otis.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.665
You got room
in your doghouse?

09:07.847 --> 09:10.077
Here you go.
Here you go. Yeah!

09:10.116 --> 09:12.983
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.987
Up.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.184
You're good, aren't you?
Now, get in the hole.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.219
Tretiak's in the net
for the Soviets.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.288
Paul Henderson's out
of the penalty box.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.732
He's on the break!
He shoots!

09:28.768 --> 09:32.135
Oh, what a save!

09:32.171 --> 09:36.232
What a comeback!
Oh! Free beef jerky for everybody!

09:36.275 --> 09:39.267
And the ice is being pelted
with Kibbles 'n Bits.

09:41.180 --> 09:43.148
What's this?

09:43.182 --> 09:47.209
Now, Otis, how many
times have I told you?

09:47.253 --> 09:50.780
If you're gonna steal something,
steal something with a little value.

09:50.823 --> 09:53.621
That's what we're looking for.
Get up here, come on.

09:53.659 --> 09:55.718
Come here.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.554
Thanks, pal.
Your kissing is getting a lot better.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.528
You don't want a baby
right now, do you?

10:08.040 --> 10:10.133
He said it.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.167
Mmm.

10:17.216 --> 10:21.710
LOKI!

10:30.863 --> 10:32.524
Dad?

10:33.833 --> 10:37.291
L-I mean,
Oh, masterful Odin, is that you?

10:37.336 --> 10:40.828
Have you found
your mask, Loki?

10:40.873 --> 10:43.808
I found a mask,
but as it turns out,

10:43.843 --> 10:46.573
- it was a fake.
- Why are you relaxing on this beach?

10:46.612 --> 10:49.172
I'm just taking a few
moments reprieve from my--

10:49.215 --> 10:51.149
Nonsense!
That mask

10:51.183 --> 10:53.913
has caused enough mischief
and malfeasance among the mortals.

10:53.953 --> 10:56.717
I curse the day
you created that thing.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.156
Why don't you just use
that all-seeing eye of yours

10:59.191 --> 11:01.921
- and tell me where it is?
- This is your mess

11:01.961 --> 11:03.588
and you will clean it up!

11:03.629 --> 11:06.063
You're a god!
Now start acting like one!

11:06.098 --> 11:08.726
Now, find that mask

11:08.768 --> 11:12.363
before I open up a can
of lightning on you!

11:18.811 --> 11:20.938
Do you need anything
while I'm out?

11:20.980 --> 11:23.175
I'm just gonna go make
a baby with the neighbor.

11:23.215 --> 11:25.945
- Honey, come here.
- What?

11:25.985 --> 11:28.977
Look! Look at all
this stuff.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.791
I've been trying to do
this for 10 years

11:32.825 --> 11:36.056
of my life, creating
these shows and--

11:38.097 --> 11:40.622
I just need more time.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.396
Okay, I get it, okay?

11:44.437 --> 11:46.405
You want your own show,

11:46.439 --> 11:48.669
and I want you
to have your own show.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.938
You're so good!

11:53.045 --> 11:55.036
But I also...

11:56.115 --> 11:59.414
really, really
wanna have a baby.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.152
So, what do we do?

12:04.190 --> 12:06.658
I want our child
to be proud of us,

12:06.692 --> 12:08.660
both of us.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.822
And if somebody asks that child,
"Hey, what does your mommy do?"

12:11.864 --> 12:15.061
He's gonna say, "Oh, she's the managing
director of Apt Apparel."

12:15.101 --> 12:18.593
They'll say, "Cool." When they say,
"What does your daddy do?"

12:18.637 --> 12:22.266
They'll say,
"He's a-- he's a--"

12:22.308 --> 12:25.937
Hey, boys and girls.
I'm Torpedo Tortoise!

12:25.978 --> 12:28.503
<i>Here at Animagine,
your dreams come true</i>

12:28.547 --> 12:32.313
<i>There's so much fun here
for me and you</i>

12:32.351 --> 12:35.411
<i>Animagine in the morning,
Animagine at night</i>

12:35.454 --> 12:37.684
<i>If watching cartoons
is wrong</i>

12:37.723 --> 12:40.191
<i>I don't want
to be right!</i>

12:41.827 --> 12:43.385
And here's one for you.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.890
Halloween party's
tomorrow night, homes.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.299
- Got a costume?
- No.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.668
Hey, maybe you could
go as a turtle.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.333
Thanks, Chad.

12:56.675 --> 12:58.666
I can't believe Chad
got promoted again.

13:00.045 --> 13:03.481
When the executives look at me,
all they see is a tortoise.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.883
Hey man, you want things
to change, you gotta make 'em change.

13:06.919 --> 13:10.150
- You ever pitch to the top man himself?
- Daniel Moss? Hell no.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.157
Well, then it's time
to man up, my road dog,

13:12.191 --> 13:14.989
because there he is.

13:15.027 --> 13:18.326
Oh my God.
He never eats lunch down here.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.093
He's too busy being
an animation god!

13:20.132 --> 13:22.259
Then it's fate, man.
You got to go over there

13:22.301 --> 13:24.929
and say, "Yo, I am
Tim Avery and I've been slugging away

13:24.970 --> 13:26.631
in this costume
for six months now

13:26.672 --> 13:29.163
and I got an idea
for a show and you need to hear it."

13:29.208 --> 13:31.836
Be aggressive, man.
If a bug bites you, bite him back!

13:31.877 --> 13:34.573
Oh, you mean like you
have with Sylvia?

13:34.613 --> 13:36.080
Shut up.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.980
You know,
maybe I should.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.542
- Should what?
- Just walk up to Daniel.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.986
- I mean, he's just a guy, right?
- Right.

13:43.022 --> 13:46.082
- What do I have to lose?
- You got nothing to lose, man!

13:47.193 --> 13:49.593
- I'm gonna do it.
- Are you crazy?

13:59.638 --> 14:01.731
Hey, Torpedo Tortoise.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.765
Hi.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.341
Something I can
do for you?

14:07.379 --> 14:09.370
Uhm...

14:10.983 --> 14:13.110
actually, yes.
Yes, you can.

14:13.152 --> 14:17.612
Um, see I've been
in the turtle suit for a while now,

14:17.656 --> 14:19.453
but, uh, I'm
a trained animator.

14:19.491 --> 14:21.459
I went to school
and everything,

14:21.493 --> 14:23.961
and, uhm, I got an idea
for a show that, uh,

14:23.996 --> 14:25.793
you gotta hear.

14:25.831 --> 14:28.629
Cool.
Lay it on me.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.760
Now?

14:30.803 --> 14:32.771
So what did he say?

14:32.805 --> 14:35.433
That my ideas lacked spark,
but the door was always open.

14:35.474 --> 14:37.271
Well, that's
a good thing.

14:37.309 --> 14:41.769
No. It's always open so he can push
guys like me out of it.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.412
Come on, Otis.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.786
Otis. Come on.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.121
Come on, boy.
Come on, Otis.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.989
Thank you, Otis.

15:17.116 --> 15:20.517
You're so sweet
and thoughtful.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.984
Which is why you'd make
such a great dad.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.218
- What are you wearing?
- Oh.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.228
Well, I was gonna go
as a werewolf victim,

15:30.262 --> 15:32.196
but Otis ruined my mask.

15:32.231 --> 15:35.359
Well, honey, you know,
we've got so much stuff around here.

15:35.401 --> 15:37.801
I don't know, just--
wear that thing.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.497
This?

15:40.506 --> 15:42.167
I can't go as this.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.574
Everyone at Animagine always goes
all out with their costumes.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.341
This is the crappiest
piece of crap in Craptown.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.440
Be a lot less crappy
if you went with me, though.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.543
I know, but I can't.
I gotta finish the Orion brochure.

15:54.586 --> 15:57.020
- You know what?
- Hmm?

15:57.056 --> 15:59.047
Go to the party...

16:00.225 --> 16:02.193
have fun,

16:02.227 --> 16:04.195
and when you get home,

16:04.229 --> 16:06.857
you can tell me
all about it.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.541
So lame.

16:30.622 --> 16:32.647
Whoa!
What the...?

17:19.137 --> 17:22.107
Don't you just
love Halloween?

17:22.141 --> 17:25.372
Whoa!

17:25.411 --> 17:27.810
Trick or treat.

17:27.846 --> 17:30.474
Hardy-har.
Let me see your work ID, please.

17:33.419 --> 17:36.479
- ID?
- No ID, no party.

17:36.522 --> 17:39.013
Where did the wife
put that invitation?

17:42.361 --> 17:45.262
ID, not IV.

17:45.297 --> 17:47.595
Excuse me.
My bad.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.769
Maybe I left it in
my other pants.

17:53.205 --> 17:56.470
- Crazy!
- Okay.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.968
Here's your drink.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.512
This party
is embarrassing.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.522
Can't we stir
things up a little?

18:10.556 --> 18:12.956
- I'm on it.
- Go get 'em.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.366
Who's that green guy?

18:24.403 --> 18:26.030
You'd better cover up,
young lady.

18:26.071 --> 18:27.663
You might catch
a chest cold.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.697
Ah.

18:32.578 --> 18:35.103
What am I thinking?

18:35.147 --> 18:37.115
Whoa! Oh!

18:37.149 --> 18:39.777
Hey!
Oh!

18:39.818 --> 18:41.809
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Ah.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.889
- Jorge.
- Sylvia.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.788
Thank you, God.

18:46.825 --> 18:51.194
- <i>You're just too good to be true.</i>
- Let's go.

18:51.230 --> 18:54.222
<i>I can't take my
eyes off of you.</i>

18:54.266 --> 18:55.995
Boo! Boo!

18:56.034 --> 18:58.559
Now hold on.
Where is everybody going?

18:58.604 --> 19:01.664
Whoo! All right.
All right!

19:01.707 --> 19:04.733
- Boo! Lame!
- Whoo-hoo!

19:04.776 --> 19:07.643
- <i>Yeah, Fringe City in the house!</i>
- <i>Work it!</i>

19:07.679 --> 19:10.842
- <i>What, what, what</i>
- <i>This is the part where you dance</i>

19:10.883 --> 19:13.579
- <i>This is the part where you boogie</i>
- <i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

19:13.619 --> 19:16.179
- <i>This is the part where you dance</i>
- <i>Uh, uh, uh, uh</i>

19:16.221 --> 19:19.019
<i>Shake your booty,
shake your cans like this</i>

19:19.057 --> 19:20.786
<i>Shake your pants,
shake-a shake-a</i>

19:20.826 --> 19:23.021
<i>Shake your pants like this,
shake your pants</i>

19:23.061 --> 19:25.029
<i>Uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh</i>

19:25.063 --> 19:26.860
<i>Ladies,
let me hear you</i>

19:26.899 --> 19:29.459
<i>You're just too good
to be true, yeah, good to be true</i>

19:29.501 --> 19:31.901
<i>Can't take my eyes off of you,
I love you, baby</i>

19:31.937 --> 19:33.905
<i>You feel like heaven
to touch, mm-hmm</i>

19:33.939 --> 19:35.907
<i>I wanna hold you
so much, yeah, yeah</i>

19:35.941 --> 19:39.536
<i>At long last, love has arrived,
I thank God I'm alive</i>

19:39.578 --> 19:42.547
<i>You're too good to be true,
can't take my eyes</i>

19:42.581 --> 19:45.641
- <i>Can't take my eyes off of you, yo</i>
- <i>What</i>

19:50.222 --> 19:51.951
<i>Pardon the way
that I stare</i>

19:51.990 --> 19:54.220
<i>No one else
who can compare</i>

19:54.259 --> 19:56.454
<i>The sight of you
leaves me weak</i>

19:56.495 --> 19:59.396
<i>There are no words
left to speak</i>

19:59.431 --> 20:01.399
<i>So if you feel
like I feel</i>

20:01.433 --> 20:03.731
<i>Please let me know
that it's real</i>

20:03.769 --> 20:06.101
<i>You're just too good
to be true</i>

20:06.138 --> 20:08.106
<i>Can't take my eyes
off of you.</i>

20:12.144 --> 20:15.079
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

20:15.113 --> 20:16.774
- Yee-haw!
- <i>Don't bring me down</i>

20:16.815 --> 20:19.249
<i>I pray, oh pretty baby...</i>

20:19.284 --> 20:21.912
- All right!
- <i>Now that I found you</i>

20:21.954 --> 20:24.320
<i>Stay and let me
love you</i>

20:24.356 --> 20:26.790
<i>Baby, let me
love you</i>

20:26.825 --> 20:28.793
<i>You're just
too good to be true</i>

20:28.827 --> 20:30.590
<i>Can't take my eyes
off you</i>

20:30.629 --> 20:34.360
<i>You feel like heaven to touch,
I wanna hold you so much</i>

20:36.368 --> 20:38.165
<i>Now at last long,
love has arrived</i>

20:38.203 --> 20:40.728
<i>I thank the Lord I'm alive,
you're too good to be true</i>

20:40.772 --> 20:43.297
<i>I can't stop watching you,
can't take my eyes off you</i>

20:43.342 --> 20:45.742
<i>Too... good...
to... be...</i>

20:52.284 --> 20:55.651
<i>I love you, baby,
hands in the air</i>

20:55.687 --> 20:57.882
<i>And if it's quite all right,
I need you, baby</i>

20:57.923 --> 20:59.788
<i>Even though you
don't care</i>

20:59.825 --> 21:01.952
<i>To warm those Ionely nights
I love you, baby</i>

21:01.994 --> 21:04.360
<i>All the ladies on the left</i>

21:04.396 --> 21:06.364
<i>Trust in me
when I say</i>

21:06.398 --> 21:08.764
<i>Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it, shake it</i>

21:08.800 --> 21:11.530
- <i>Oh pretty baby</i>
- <i>All the fellas on the right</i>

21:11.570 --> 21:13.367
<i>Don't bring me down,
I pray</i>

21:13.405 --> 21:15.339
- <i>Oh, pretty baby</i>
- <i>Getting freaky on the side</i>

21:15.374 --> 21:17.638
<i>Now that
I found you, stay</i>

21:17.676 --> 21:20.611
<i>And let me
love you, baby.</i>

21:20.646 --> 21:23.877
- Jump, jump, jump, jump.
- <i>Let me love you</i>

21:25.751 --> 21:27.981
<i>This is the part
where you boogie</i>

21:28.020 --> 21:30.011
<i>This is the part
where you dance!</i>

21:38.363 --> 21:40.729
Honey, I'm home.

21:43.001 --> 21:47.370
- Babe, what's gotten into you?
- Let's find out.

22:27.446 --> 22:30.142
That was off the chain
last night, guru.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.912
You were a whirling dervish
of craziness, homes.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.545
Hey, um, did you--
did you use holograms

22:35.587 --> 22:37.748
for-- for all that--
that stuff?

22:37.789 --> 22:40.451
Whoa, Avery, I didn't know
you had it in you, man!

22:40.492 --> 22:42.653
Yeah, well,
me neither.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.856
- Tim Avery?
- Yeah.

22:45.897 --> 22:48.127
Daniel Moss would
like to see you in his office.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.157
Do you have
a minute?

23:04.249 --> 23:06.979
This has potential.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.711
Come here.
Come here.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.959
This has that spark
I was looking for.

23:16.995 --> 23:19.964
I mean, not to be
crass about it,

23:19.998 --> 23:23.832
but this guy-- this could be
a franchise character.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.529
How'd you come up
with this?

23:29.574 --> 23:31.906
M-my dog brought
it to me.

23:31.943 --> 23:35.470
Oh, yeah. If we knew
where the great ones came from,

23:35.514 --> 23:37.607
we'd go there
every day, right?

23:37.649 --> 23:39.708
Yeah.

23:41.186 --> 23:43.086
Listen,

23:43.121 --> 23:45.919
I think we could
do something with this.

23:45.957 --> 23:49.290
How would you
like to move up to the second floor?

23:51.997 --> 23:53.988
Where is it?
Where is it?

24:00.071 --> 24:02.198
Otis! You know that mask
you were chewing on,

24:02.240 --> 24:04.208
the wooden one?
Where is it, boy?

24:05.677 --> 24:07.770
Find it and I'll take
you to see Venus--

24:07.813 --> 24:10.373
you know, that cute little Jack Russell
you're always trying to jump?

24:10.415 --> 24:13.350
Yes, I think you guys
would make a good couple.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.353
I don't know.
I don't speak Doberman.

24:15.387 --> 24:17.446
Babe!
I got incredible news!

24:17.489 --> 24:19.889
Really?
I think I do too!

24:19.925 --> 24:21.893
- Really? What?
- Um, you go.

24:21.927 --> 24:23.519
- No, you go.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.154
- Babe, let me go.
- Okay, go.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.064
Guess who got moved up
to the second floor?

24:30.735 --> 24:34.000
Oh God, that is so great!
I am so proud of you.

24:34.039 --> 24:37.167
- Oh, then it was meant to be.
- What's meant to be? What's your news?

24:37.209 --> 24:39.439
I've been feeling
really funky all day

24:39.478 --> 24:42.538
- and you're not gonna believe this.
- I'm not gonna believe what?

24:42.581 --> 24:44.913
- Tell me! What? What?
- Okay. I think I might be...

24:46.485 --> 24:48.453
- Pregnant.
- Yes!

24:50.489 --> 24:54.186
Oh, but how can that be, 'cause we--
that can't be-- we just--

24:54.226 --> 24:57.559
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

24:57.596 --> 25:00.121
Where's there a trashcan?
Where's there a trashcan?

25:10.208 --> 25:13.075
- Is that normal?
- No.

25:13.111 --> 25:16.512
And what's worse,
it's not covered by insurance.

25:18.550 --> 25:21.610
<i>Baby face</i>

25:21.653 --> 25:23.382
<i>You've got
the cutest little</i>

25:23.421 --> 25:25.514
- <i>Baby face.</i>
- Mm-hmm!

25:25.557 --> 25:28.117
- He goes here, he comes running...
- <i>There's not another one</i>

25:28.159 --> 25:31.720
- <i>Could take your place</i>
-... and bam, in his face.

25:31.763 --> 25:33.390
<i>Baby face</i>

25:33.431 --> 25:36.229
- <i>My poor heart is jumpin'.</i>
- Honey, that's our baby!

25:36.268 --> 25:37.963
<i>You sure have
started something.</i>

25:38.003 --> 25:41.268
<i>Ah, freak out!</i>

25:41.306 --> 25:44.673
<i>When I play the maracas
I go chic-chicky-boom</i>

25:44.709 --> 25:46.939
<i>Chic-chicky-boom</i>

25:46.978 --> 25:49.572
<i>Baby face</i>

25:49.614 --> 25:51.582
<i>I'm up in heaven</i>

25:51.616 --> 25:54.244
- <i>When I'm in your fond embrace.</i>
- Hello, in there.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.220
- Wow.
- What?

25:56.254 --> 25:58.779
- l-I think my water just broke.
- <i>I didn't need a shove</i>

25:58.823 --> 26:00.723
- <i>'Cause I just fell in love...</i>
- Really?

26:00.759 --> 26:04.058
- It's a boy.
- <i>With your pretty baby</i>

26:04.095 --> 26:06.063
<i>Pretty baby</i>

26:06.097 --> 26:10.431
<i>Face!</i>

26:10.468 --> 26:12.459
Oh, Alvey.

26:15.006 --> 26:16.997
Say hello to your son.

26:18.143 --> 26:21.135
Uh, hello there, son.

26:21.179 --> 26:23.147
I've been waiting
to meet you

26:23.181 --> 26:24.978
for nine months now.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.653
Whoa. He's got
a killer grip.

26:30.689 --> 26:33.157
But Dad counteracts
with his Pinky of Doom.

26:36.695 --> 26:39.391
Hey, do you know
who I am?

26:39.431 --> 26:41.126
I'm your dad.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.661
Loki!

26:52.043 --> 26:54.011
There was a baby

26:54.045 --> 26:56.707
born of the mask!

27:07.158 --> 27:09.649
Damn!
Where's my mask?!

27:09.694 --> 27:11.992
Sir, y-you're gonna
have to pay for that.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.464
The advertisement
said they were authentic!

27:20.505 --> 27:22.473
They are authentic.

27:22.507 --> 27:25.840
They're authentic Pakistani
Norse Mythology masks.

27:28.847 --> 27:31.213
Okay.
Now let me think.

27:31.249 --> 27:34.776
What should
I turn him into?

27:34.819 --> 27:39.620
Loki!

27:40.992 --> 27:42.391
Dad?

27:43.395 --> 27:44.953
Fool!

27:44.996 --> 27:47.692
What in Helveti were you
about to do to this shopkeep?

27:47.732 --> 27:49.893
- Nothing, I was just--
- Fool!

27:49.934 --> 27:51.902
Don't you dare
lie to me.

27:51.936 --> 27:54.530
You know, Thor never gave me
this kind of trouble.

27:54.572 --> 27:57.234
Okay, here we go again
with the Thor crap.

27:57.275 --> 28:00.039
Thor, Thor, Thor.
You know, father, I'm not like Thor.

28:00.078 --> 28:02.103
I'm never gonna
be like Thor.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.047
I just wish that--
can't you just

28:04.082 --> 28:06.346
love me for who I am

28:06.384 --> 28:08.716
and not for who I'm not?

28:08.753 --> 28:11.551
No! I want you to be
more like Thor!

28:11.589 --> 28:13.557
Now, I've wasted
enough time here.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.559
I felt a tremor.

28:15.593 --> 28:18.027
A child has been
born of the mask!

28:18.063 --> 28:20.327
Wow. A baby's born
of the mask,

28:20.365 --> 28:23.425
so that sort of makes me
kind of like a dad, huh?

28:23.468 --> 28:25.732
- Find it!
- The baby or the mask?

28:25.770 --> 28:27.738
Find the baby

28:27.772 --> 28:30.104
and you will
find the mask.

28:30.141 --> 28:32.132
Right.

28:35.914 --> 28:37.882
Tonya, have you
seen Otis?

28:37.916 --> 28:39.907
He's in his
new doghouse!

28:41.119 --> 28:43.087
Who's a happy baby?

28:43.121 --> 28:44.816
Who's a happy baby?

28:46.024 --> 28:48.015
Let's blow up
another one.

28:49.194 --> 28:51.458
You like these, huh?
They're pretty!

28:51.496 --> 28:53.464
Honey, honey, honey,
just a second ago,

28:53.498 --> 28:56.490
he was counting the balloons.
He held up five fingers.

28:56.534 --> 28:58.502
That's great, hon.
I gotta go.

28:58.536 --> 29:01.266
Daniel brought in Chad
to backstab me-- oh, I mean help me--

29:01.306 --> 29:03.604
and I gotta get to work
before he helps me out of a job.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.609
Hey.

29:05.643 --> 29:07.804
What do you think,
Double A?

29:07.846 --> 29:10.872
Would you watch this, huh? Hey hon,
I know I've asked like a million times,

29:10.915 --> 29:13.884
but you happen to see that mask I was
looking for, you know the wooden one--

29:13.918 --> 29:16.614
Okay, a billion times, and no.
Why do you need it so badly?

29:16.654 --> 29:19.555
I don't need it.
Who said I need it? Don't need it.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.559
- Bye.
- Bye.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.720
Bye. Say "Bye, Daddy."
Bye bye.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.731
Bye bye. Here.
You want another one?

29:26.765 --> 29:28.733
Okay, watch,
watch, watch.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.265
"I want you to be
more like Thor."

30:05.303 --> 30:07.271
Oh, what a jerk.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.671
Oh hey!
It's my ear, nose and throat guy.

30:09.707 --> 30:11.675
Odin thinks
he's so great.

30:11.709 --> 30:13.870
Hello! No one even
worships you anymore.

30:13.912 --> 30:15.709
I could have
been a doctor

30:15.747 --> 30:17.840
if the SAT weren't
so culturally biased.

30:17.882 --> 30:21.181
Now, let's see. Oh, "Infectious
Diseases," that always cracks me up.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.119
Maternity ward.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.281
Okay, first I find
the magic baby,

30:25.323 --> 30:28.156
then downstairs to the cafeteria
for some Jell-O brick.

30:28.193 --> 30:31.685
Who do you have to sting to get some
answers in this place?

30:31.729 --> 30:33.356
Bingo!

30:33.398 --> 30:35.366
All right,
here we go.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.368
Buckle up.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.529
Oh, hold on tight.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.539
Okay, baby, this
is gonna hurt you

30:41.573 --> 30:43.507
more than it's
gonna hurt me.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.477
Ah!

30:57.989 --> 31:00.685
Okay, let's start with...

31:00.725 --> 31:02.989
uh, July 27th.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.789
Babies born on that day.

31:06.831 --> 31:09.493
Oh, my. Why are there
so many babies born?

31:18.209 --> 31:20.404
- Who are you?
- You.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.436
- Me?
- Who?

31:27.252 --> 31:30.278
- <i>I thank the Lord for the nighttime</i>
- <i>Lord for the nighttime</i>

31:30.321 --> 31:32.619
- <i>To forget the day</i>
- <i>Forget the day</i>

31:32.657 --> 31:35.626
- <i>A day of up-- uptight time</i>
- <i>Up-- uptight time</i>

31:35.660 --> 31:37.628
- <i>Baby, chase it away</i>
- <i>Chase it away</i>

31:37.662 --> 31:40.290
- <i>I get relaxation</i>
- <i>Lord for the nighttime</i>

31:40.331 --> 31:42.731
- <i>And it's a time to groove</i>
- <i>A time to groove</i>

31:42.767 --> 31:46.032
- <i>I thank the Lord for the nighttime</i>
- <i>Lord for the nighttime</i>

31:46.070 --> 31:48.061
<i>I thank the Lord
for you</i>

31:51.709 --> 31:56.578
<i>Talk about plans,
now, baby, I got plenty.</i>

31:56.614 --> 31:59.481
- It's okay.
- <i>Nothing ever seems to turn out</i>

31:59.517 --> 32:01.883
- <i>The way it should.</i>
- It's okay.

32:01.920 --> 32:05.617
- Bottle.
- <i>Seems like just one time</i>

32:05.657 --> 32:08.649
<i>I'm feeling good</i>

32:08.693 --> 32:12.686
- <i>I thank the Lord for the nighttime</i>
- <i>Lord for the nighttime</i>

32:12.730 --> 32:15.221
- <i>To forget the day</i>
- <i>Forget the day...</i>

32:16.334 --> 32:17.494
Huh?

32:17.535 --> 32:20.060
Hmm?

32:20.104 --> 32:22.299
- <i>I get relaxation</i>
- <i>Lord for the nighttime</i>

32:22.340 --> 32:24.672
- <i>And it's a time to groove</i>
- <i>A time to groove</i>

32:24.709 --> 32:27.735
- <i>I thank the Lord for the nighttime</i>
- <i>Lord for the nighttime</i>

32:27.779 --> 32:31.681
- <i>Baby</i>
- <i>I thank the Lord for you.</i>

32:32.717 --> 32:34.776
<i>Save me.</i>

32:40.391 --> 32:43.087
- It's okay, baby. I got him.
- Okay.

33:00.378 --> 33:02.539
Tim.
Tim.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.344
- Okay, it's my turn.
- No, no. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.408
- It's-- it's my turn?
- He's asleep. He's asleep.

33:07.452 --> 33:09.420
But, baby, can you go in
late to work today?

33:09.454 --> 33:12.981
My office just called. Um, they're
sending me to New York for a week.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.163
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm-- I'm sorry, Daniel.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.828
My wife's gotta go out of town
for work. It's just a week,

33:24.869 --> 33:26.803
but I have to take care
of the baby.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.238
Hey, you gotta do the kid
thing, I understand.

33:29.273 --> 33:32.674
Just unfortunate timing.
The network called,

33:32.710 --> 33:35.736
they want to see our green guy
thing by the end of the week,

33:35.780 --> 33:38.578
but I'll just put
Chad on it.

33:40.918 --> 33:42.886
- I'm on it.
- What?

33:42.920 --> 33:44.888
I said I need to be home,
as in my house,

33:44.922 --> 33:46.890
but I didn't say
I couldn't work.

33:46.924 --> 33:48.892
Line up the pitch.
I'm on it,

33:48.926 --> 33:50.917
and I won't let
you down.

33:52.697 --> 33:56.326
Cool. Try to give it that spark I saw
at the Halloween party.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.164
Okay.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.534
I left all the phone numbers
on the refrigerator

34:00.571 --> 34:03.062
and you need to give him a bath
before he goes to bed,

34:03.107 --> 34:06.338
but don't get any water in his ears,
'cause he freaks out a little bit.

34:06.377 --> 34:09.005
Um, and if he gets cranky,
you just put him in his car seat

34:09.047 --> 34:12.244
and play the Baby Mozart CD, but don't
just pop him in front of the TV;

34:12.283 --> 34:14.251
it's gonna
make him stupid.

34:14.284 --> 34:16.310
Um, uh, if you feel
like you're drowning,

34:16.353 --> 34:18.844
just go see Betty down the
street. She has like 10 kids.

34:18.889 --> 34:21.085
- Honey? Do I have to mash his bananas?
- Yeah?

34:21.125 --> 34:22.752
- l-- l--
- Okay, you're gonna be fine.

34:22.793 --> 34:24.193
Can I say goodbye?

34:26.230 --> 34:30.030
Mommy loves you
so much.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.592
Okay.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.628
And Mommy loves you too.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.230
- Mommy, I can't do this.
- Huh? You can.

34:36.274 --> 34:37.741
- I can't.
- You can.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.039
Mommy. Honey, take him.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.170
- Bye.
- Honey, take him.

34:42.213 --> 34:43.804
- I love you.
- Honey, take him.

34:43.848 --> 34:45.782
Bye.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.808
Bye.

34:59.297 --> 35:01.265
Okay.
All right, Alvey.

35:01.299 --> 35:04.234
Okay. All right.
We're gonna have a good time.

35:04.268 --> 35:07.396
Here we go.
Come on. Yes.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.303
Look at the pretty colors.

35:10.641 --> 35:12.802
Oh, look! Ah, ee.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.179
Fun, right?

35:17.215 --> 35:20.651
Look at me!
I'm happy, I'm... happy.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.790
Okay.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.099
Okay, buddy,

35:40.138 --> 35:42.163
it's just you
and me this morning

35:42.206 --> 35:45.175
and we're gonna
have fun and gonna play.

35:45.209 --> 35:47.200
You excited?
Okay.

35:50.348 --> 35:52.908
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy. Can you get down here now?

35:52.950 --> 35:55.510
- Daniel's asking for you.
- No, I can't come in right now.

35:55.553 --> 35:58.317
- I'm stuck here with my kid.
- You'd better think of something.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.847
He wants to see your drawings
before the pitch on Friday.

36:00.892 --> 36:04.123
All right. I'll do the drawings now
and I'll fax 'em over after lunch.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.153
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

36:06.197 --> 36:09.064
Hey, pal.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.934
Daddy's got a teensy-weensy bit
of work to do,

36:12.970 --> 36:14.938
so can you be a good
boy and let him?

36:26.784 --> 36:28.581
Hello?

36:28.619 --> 36:32.555
- Honey, hey!
- Hey, hon, how you doin'?

36:32.590 --> 36:35.388
So, how are you
and Alvey doing?

36:35.426 --> 36:37.621
Oh, we're doing fine.
Yeah, we're doing great.

36:37.662 --> 36:39.892
Two little peas in a pod.
How's your thing going?

36:39.931 --> 36:41.489
Good. Uh, he loved
the comps,

36:41.532 --> 36:43.557
so now we just gotta rush
it all into production.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.569
So, how's Alvey?

36:45.603 --> 36:47.571
Is he eating?
How's he sleeping?

36:47.605 --> 36:49.835
Hold on, hon.
Somebody wants to talk to you.

36:49.874 --> 36:53.002
Hi! How's my little
womping wompet?

36:53.044 --> 36:55.945
Oh, I miss you. I just want to kiss you
and kiss you and kiss you!

36:55.980 --> 36:58.448
Okay, hon.
Yeah, he loves you too.

36:58.482 --> 37:00.973
- Hurry home. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

37:01.018 --> 37:02.508
Aww.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.987
Well, isn't it great

37:05.022 --> 37:06.580
that her work
is going so well?

37:06.624 --> 37:10.287
- Ma?
- Yes. Ma and her career are just--

37:12.396 --> 37:14.364
- Did you say ma?
- Mama.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.366
Oh my God.
You said mama!

37:16.400 --> 37:18.368
Well, can you say "dad"

37:18.402 --> 37:21.098
- or "da-da?"
- Mommy.

37:22.707 --> 37:25.574
That's great!
You're doing great!

37:25.610 --> 37:28.807
But come on,
say "da-da". Da-da

37:28.846 --> 37:31.644
Mother.

37:36.287 --> 37:39.688
Timmy Tyler,
are you my mask baby?

37:51.802 --> 37:54.066
- Yes?
- Good afternoon!

37:54.105 --> 37:56.005
- May I come in?
- Ah--

37:56.040 --> 37:58.372
What a lovely abode.
Oh my, and such a lush carpet.

37:58.409 --> 38:00.377
You're exactly
the kind of person

38:00.411 --> 38:02.811
the Vacuummeister 3000
was invented for!

38:02.847 --> 38:04.371
Well, if I don't
clean up, no one will.

38:04.415 --> 38:08.181
That is why you need
the Vacuummeister 3000!

38:08.219 --> 38:10.585
It has dual sweeps,
durable airpaths,

38:10.621 --> 38:12.486
jiggle control, multi-Teflon
coated filtering

38:12.523 --> 38:13.956
and it's built
with a direct-drive design

38:13.991 --> 38:16.687
that is so powerful,
it sucks the dirt

38:16.727 --> 38:18.285
off the dirt!

38:18.329 --> 38:21.628
- Is that safe?
- Allow me to demonstrate.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.634
- Oh, don't you need to plug it in?
- No.

38:26.337 --> 38:29.067
This is a terrible
demonstration.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.017
Hello, you little...
ugly thing.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.351
Let's see if you're
the one, hmm?

38:47.692 --> 38:50.559
Bend. Morph!

38:50.594 --> 38:52.323
Shape shift.

38:52.363 --> 38:54.354
Well, do something
for Odin's sake.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.937
No!

39:06.977 --> 39:10.777
I think it's time to introduce you
to man's best friend.

39:10.815 --> 39:14.012
And I don't
mean you, Otis.

39:14.051 --> 39:16.019
Okay.

39:16.053 --> 39:18.021
Mommy doesn't want me
to do this,

39:18.055 --> 39:20.751
but what Mommy doesn't
know won't hurt her.

39:20.791 --> 39:23.191
-... sour cream and onion...
- Oh, look.

39:28.265 --> 39:29.994
Hey, wait a minute.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.628
We don't like
your attitude!

39:32.670 --> 39:35.264
Keep an eye
on him, will ya?

39:40.244 --> 39:43.839
Look at Bam Bam.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.145
Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam!

39:46.183 --> 39:49.516
Bam Bam looks miserable
without Pebbles.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.860
Bam.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.959
Bam, bam, bam.

41:15.005 --> 41:17.166
Smoking!

41:26.917 --> 41:29.078
<i>Hello, my baby,
hello, my honey</i>

41:29.119 --> 41:31.246
<i>Hello, my ragtime gal</i>

41:31.288 --> 41:33.518
<i>Send me a kiss
by wire</i>

41:33.557 --> 41:35.889
<i>Baby, my heart's
on fire</i>

41:35.926 --> 41:38.690
<i>If you refuse me,
honey, you'll lose me</i>

41:38.729 --> 41:41.698
<i>Then you'll be left alone,
oh, baby, telephone</i>

41:41.732 --> 41:44.860
<i>And tell me
I'm your own.</i>

41:47.605 --> 41:50.233
<i>Everybody do
the Michigan rag</i>

41:50.274 --> 41:53.243
Every Mame and Jane
and Ruth...

41:55.813 --> 41:57.906
<i>Stomp, romp,
pomp the Michigan</i>

41:57.948 --> 42:00.280
<i>Jump, clump, pump
the Michigan rag</i>

42:00.317 --> 42:04.219
<i>That lovin' rag!</i>

42:16.534 --> 42:20.368
<i>Please don't talk
about me when I'm gone</i>

42:20.404 --> 42:22.372
<i>Oh, honey</i>

42:22.406 --> 42:25.136
<i>Though our friendship
ceases from now on.</i>

43:08.786 --> 43:11.516
I don't know how.
I don't know which end is up.

43:11.555 --> 43:13.989
I'm running on fumes.

43:14.024 --> 43:16.288
Yeah.
Yeah.

43:19.396 --> 43:21.796
I don't know.

43:21.832 --> 43:24.630
Yeah, I've still
got the kid.

43:24.668 --> 43:27.193
Oh God,
you have no idea.

43:27.237 --> 43:29.831
Man, they just suck
the life out of you.

43:29.873 --> 43:31.841
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with him.

43:31.875 --> 43:34.366
I think I may be on to something
for my pitch, though.

43:34.411 --> 43:36.402
I don't know,
it's just--

43:38.649 --> 43:41.140
<i>Hello, my baby,
hello, my honey</i>

43:41.185 --> 43:43.176
<i>Hello, my ragtime gal</i>

43:43.220 --> 43:45.586
<i>Send me a kiss
by wire</i>

43:45.623 --> 43:48.490
<i>Baby, my heart's
on fire</i>

43:48.525 --> 43:50.652
<i>If you refuse me,
honey, you lose me</i>

43:50.694 --> 43:53.822
<i>Then you'll be left alone,
oh, baby, telephone</i>

43:53.864 --> 43:57.265
<i>And tell me
I'm your own.</i>

44:03.907 --> 44:06.808
Yow! Ooh!

44:23.460 --> 44:25.587
Hi, 911?
I already told you.

44:25.629 --> 44:27.654
My son is bouncing
off the walls!

44:27.698 --> 44:30.326
Yes, off the walls,
the couch,

44:30.367 --> 44:33.530
and the ceiling.
Hello. Hello? Hello?!

44:33.570 --> 44:36.198
<i>Everybody do
the Michigan rag</i>

44:36.240 --> 44:39.437
<i>Everybody likes
the Michigan rag</i>

44:39.476 --> 44:41.444
<i>Stomp, romp,
pomp the Michigan</i>

44:41.478 --> 44:44.242
- <i>Jump, clump, pump the Michigan rag</i>
- Betty!

44:44.281 --> 44:47.045
<i>Everybody do
the Michigan rag</i>

44:47.084 --> 44:50.383
<i>Everybody likes
the Michigan rag</i>

44:50.421 --> 44:53.254
<i>That lovin' rag!</i>

44:53.290 --> 44:55.053
Don't stop, little--

44:55.092 --> 44:56.719
- Yeah?
- Betty!

44:56.760 --> 44:59.194
I need your help.

44:59.229 --> 45:00.719
Tim, what's wrong?

45:00.764 --> 45:02.732
Uh, uh, well, Tonya said
if I ever needed--

45:02.766 --> 45:05.291
you know-- oh, uh, well, if any--
if I saw anything weird.

45:05.335 --> 45:07.963
It's Alvey. It's Alvey.
It was Alvey. See?

45:08.005 --> 45:09.472
He was--
he was bouncing

45:09.506 --> 45:11.531
and he-- he did the Woody laugh,
you know...

45:13.744 --> 45:16.372
And he was singing.

45:16.413 --> 45:18.779
Well, lots of babies
his age sing.

45:18.816 --> 45:21.250
Vaudeville?

45:21.285 --> 45:23.446
Okay, I'll show you.

45:23.487 --> 45:25.717
Okay, okay.
Here we go.

45:27.124 --> 45:29.786
Go on. Sing.

45:30.961 --> 45:33.953
Go on, Alvey.

45:35.199 --> 45:37.497
Do it.

45:37.534 --> 45:40.469
Do it.
Sing, damn it!

45:40.504 --> 45:42.472
- Sing--
- Tim!

45:42.506 --> 45:45.373
- He's a baby.
- Exactly my point.

45:57.121 --> 46:00.056
I'm here to unclog
your throne.

46:04.061 --> 46:06.495
Oh, Jason Kemperbee,

46:06.530 --> 46:08.623
be my baby.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.360
Come on.

46:11.401 --> 46:14.837
Hook me up.
Show me the magic.

46:21.678 --> 46:24.647
Alvey.

46:24.681 --> 46:26.342
Put that down.

46:26.383 --> 46:28.817
That's Mommy
and Daddy's.

46:28.852 --> 46:31.616
Please put the fax
machine down.

46:36.827 --> 46:40.319
Want some juice?
Here, want some juice?

46:40.364 --> 46:42.798
It's okay. Here you go, Alvey.
Have some juice.

46:42.833 --> 46:44.664
Yeah, you like juice.

46:45.869 --> 46:48.736
See, Alvey?
Daddy's not gonna hurt you.

46:48.772 --> 46:50.797
Whoa! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

46:50.841 --> 46:53.309
No! Hey! Hey! Ah!

46:53.343 --> 46:55.174
Hey! Hey! Hey!

46:55.212 --> 46:59.239
Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam!

47:06.523 --> 47:08.582
Rattle.

47:45.329 --> 47:47.354
Aww, poor baby.

47:53.036 --> 47:55.027
Huh? Oh!

48:03.647 --> 48:05.376
Uh-oh.

48:25.269 --> 48:28.397
<i>If they could
see me now</i>

48:28.438 --> 48:31.066
<i>That little gang of mine</i>

48:31.108 --> 48:33.167
<i>Eatin' fancy chow</i>

48:33.210 --> 48:35.804
<i>And drinkin' fancy wine</i>

48:35.846 --> 48:38.314
<i>All I can say is, "Wow"</i>

48:38.348 --> 48:40.612
<i>Look at where I am</i>

48:40.651 --> 48:43.051
<i>Then I landed-- pow!</i>

48:43.086 --> 48:45.054
<i>Right in a pot of jam</i>

48:45.088 --> 48:47.750
<i>What a setup</i>

48:47.791 --> 48:49.759
<i>Holy cow</i>

48:49.793 --> 48:51.761
<i>Never believe it</i>

48:51.795 --> 48:54.286
<i>If my friends
could see me now</i>

48:54.331 --> 48:57.027
<i>Lord, if they could
see me now.</i>

49:09.846 --> 49:11.074
- Yes?
- Hi!

49:11.114 --> 49:13.241
Would you like
some Thin Chocolate?

49:21.758 --> 49:23.749
Yeah, you can run,
but you can't hide!

49:27.798 --> 49:29.857
Transformers.

49:32.402 --> 49:34.370
Alvey?

49:34.404 --> 49:36.702
You-- you wouldn't do that
to Da-da, would you?

49:36.740 --> 49:38.708
I'm your dad.

49:38.742 --> 49:41.040
C-can you say "dad"?

49:41.078 --> 49:44.047
"Da-da"?

49:46.383 --> 49:48.180
Madre.

49:50.220 --> 49:52.188
This is too much
too handle.

49:52.222 --> 49:54.190
I mean,
this is insanity.

49:54.224 --> 49:56.215
Dancing?

50:04.134 --> 50:07.160
No. No.

50:07.204 --> 50:09.764
Shh.

50:19.082 --> 50:21.107
Fire!

50:21.151 --> 50:23.119
Bull's-eye!

50:29.426 --> 50:31.326
Hmm?

50:34.197 --> 50:37.098
Here we are
by the baby.

50:59.456 --> 51:01.822
Oh, yeah.
Who's the dog?

51:01.858 --> 51:03.826
Who's the big dog--

51:16.873 --> 51:20.138
Whoa!

52:13.763 --> 52:15.754
Mommy!

52:48.031 --> 52:50.022
I surrender.

53:06.483 --> 53:08.212
Bye-bye.

53:20.597 --> 53:22.565
Oh, shoot.

53:27.537 --> 53:29.528
Oh!

53:36.713 --> 53:38.408
Stop it!

53:38.448 --> 53:40.916
This is insane!

53:40.951 --> 53:42.942
Point it down!

53:49.392 --> 53:51.553
- All done?
- Hmm.

54:10.780 --> 54:12.873
- Hey, I'm Rod.
- Get in here!

54:12.916 --> 54:14.941
Okay.

54:14.985 --> 54:18.216
Uh, take a look at this.

54:18.255 --> 54:20.450
Hey, what a cute
little baby.

54:20.490 --> 54:22.549
- Oh, of course!
- Mind if I take a look at him?

54:22.592 --> 54:24.583
No, go ahead.
I don't care.

54:26.296 --> 54:28.127
Come on.
Do something crazy.

54:28.164 --> 54:30.098
Yeah, do
something crazy!

54:30.133 --> 54:33.398
Crap! Huh-uh, huh-uh.

54:33.436 --> 54:35.427
Damn it. This isn't
the right one either.

54:37.374 --> 54:39.342
Hey!
What are you doing?

54:39.376 --> 54:41.367
Uh, I left your package
in the foyer.

54:45.682 --> 54:47.673
Do I have a package? Okay.

54:54.190 --> 54:57.626
Oh well.

55:01.064 --> 55:03.055
What happened?

55:04.934 --> 55:07.562
You did this to me.
I know what you're doing.

55:09.239 --> 55:11.298
You're trying
to drive me crazy.

55:11.341 --> 55:13.002
You're a cunning
little mastermind

55:13.043 --> 55:15.705
who will stop at
nothing until I go

55:15.745 --> 55:17.736
completely insane.

55:19.716 --> 55:21.513
Well, come on.

55:21.551 --> 55:24.213
Start dancing again.

55:25.388 --> 55:28.448
Start screwing
with my mind!

55:28.491 --> 55:30.982
Start, huh?
Come on!

55:36.032 --> 55:38.398
Why aren't you
screwing with my mind?

55:42.439 --> 55:44.407
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

55:44.441 --> 55:46.409
Maybe I am just
going crazy.

55:46.443 --> 55:49.105
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

55:49.145 --> 55:51.113
Maybe I am just going crazy.

55:51.147 --> 55:54.674
Maybe I am
just going--

56:12.802 --> 56:15.532
That's it, buddy.
First I'm taking you to a pediatrician,

56:15.572 --> 56:17.563
then I'm taking you
to an exorcist.

56:28.318 --> 56:30.946
Who are you?!

56:30.987 --> 56:32.955
Oh my G--

56:32.989 --> 56:36.220
my son is the devil.
My son is the devil.

56:36.259 --> 56:39.319
Oh my Odin,
it is him.

56:41.731 --> 56:44.097
We're just going to have
a nice little drive,

56:44.134 --> 56:46.125
while Daddy has
a nervous breakdown.

56:47.737 --> 56:50.103
Please leave a message.

56:50.140 --> 56:52.540
Tonya, it's Betty.
You said I should keep an eye out

56:52.575 --> 56:54.509
and call you if there
are any problems?

56:54.544 --> 56:56.273
I think there's a problem.

57:10.660 --> 57:12.628
No parking there.

57:12.662 --> 57:15.722
That's a handicapped zone!

57:15.765 --> 57:17.699
Hey! Sir?

57:22.572 --> 57:24.472
Hey, wait!

57:25.475 --> 57:27.602
Stop! You!

57:27.644 --> 57:30.875
Hey!

57:32.715 --> 57:34.683
What is it?

57:35.952 --> 57:37.817
- Ah!
- Okay, where is the mask?

57:37.854 --> 57:40.345
- What?
- The mask. My mask. Where is it?

57:40.390 --> 57:42.017
What are you talking
about? Who are you?

57:42.058 --> 57:43.719
I am Loki, God of Mischief.

57:43.760 --> 57:46.456
Yeah, and I'm Tim, God of Crazy
Babyland. Will you get out of the way?

57:46.496 --> 57:47.986
That baby is born
of the mask-- my mask.

57:48.031 --> 57:50.124
- Now, where is it?!
- Born of the mask-- what?

57:52.001 --> 57:55.095
Oh, so that explains why
he could pee like that!

57:56.239 --> 57:58.503
But wait a minute.
This is my baby.

57:58.541 --> 58:01.135
I don't care about that.
Just give me my mask!

58:01.177 --> 58:03.145
- I don't know where it is.
- Oh really?

58:03.179 --> 58:05.170
Maybe this will
jog your memory!

58:09.252 --> 58:11.777
- Loki!!
- Dad?!

58:11.821 --> 58:14.016
I've warned you! You've
left me no other choice.

58:14.057 --> 58:16.719
I don't have time for this.
Look, Dad, there's Balder.

58:44.153 --> 58:46.713
- Just give me the mask.
- I don't have it.

58:48.958 --> 58:50.926
I think my dog ate it.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.588
That is the oldest
excuse in the book,

58:53.630 --> 58:57.088
and I've read some really,
really old books.

58:57.133 --> 59:00.796
But if you want
to do this the hard way...

59:00.837 --> 59:03.135
so be it.

59:24.093 --> 59:25.958
Oh, you're good.

59:29.966 --> 59:31.957
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

59:35.805 --> 59:38.171
You really are a chip
off the old block.

59:38.207 --> 59:41.938
But I don't have time for this.
Prepare to feel my true power!

59:52.188 --> 59:55.851
Loki!

59:59.963 --> 01:00:02.022
You have defied me

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:04.590
for the last time.

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:06.261
I've had it up
to here with you!

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:09.100
Dad, please listen to me.
You're holding the baby.

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:13.802
Silence!
You have left me no choice.

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.936
- Listen, listen--
- You are hereby stripped

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:18.880
of your immortal powers
and forever banished

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:21.213
to the land of mortals.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.616
No! Please, hear me out.
That baby--

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:38.192
Whoa.

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:58.320
- Pretty.
- Whoa.

01:00:58.354 --> 01:01:01.915
Whoa.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.360
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you, homes?

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:08.489
Your pitch meeting
is starting right now.

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:11.295
Um, I just met Green.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.928
- Loki.
- Snap out of it.

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:15.961
Where are you?
I'll pick you up.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.505
What's the deal, Tim?
I get you a network pitch,

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:25.673
and you repay me by showing up
20 minutes late

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.444
looking like an escaped
mental patient?

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.451
And with a kid?

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.851
Huh?

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.947
This is Tim Avery.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.958
He created
the character,

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:38.460
so why don't I just let him
tell you more about it?

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:40.485
Tim?

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:49.161
Tim?

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:55.377
Guys, I could walk.

01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:58.107
L-I guess he didn't
like the pitch.

01:01:58.147 --> 01:02:01.742
I just--
I wanna get all my stuff.

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.347
Tim?

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.356
Pick up the phone!

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.358
Tim!

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.917
Betty just called.
She's completely freaked out!

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:15.453
Oh, God. Call me the second
you get this message.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.537
Hey, it's me.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.539
Uh, got your message.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.939
Well, things are
really great here.

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:29.467
Uh, me and Alvey got chased
by a guy named Loki.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:31.776
Well, that's
not important.

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:35.614
I pitched, uh,
my show today,

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:37.619
and, um...

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:39.644
I got fired.

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:44.960
Yeah.

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:46.962
Um...

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:48.964
but Alvey pooped,

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.989
which is good, and, uh...

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:55.232
and Alvey saved me.

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:58.832
It was amazing.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.843
But, uh, uh,
the main thing is, uh,

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:03.402
we're totally fine.
Everything's great.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:06.176
Um, better than fine,
actually.

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:08.046
Alvey's great.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.052
I love you.

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:12.077
Okay, bye.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:30.468
<i>I, well, I see
trees of green</i>

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:32.906
<i>And red roses too</i>

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:38.209
<i>I'll watch them bloom
for me and you</i>

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:41.842
<i>And I think to myself</i>

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:47.083
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:55.723
<i>I hear babies cry
and I watch them grow</i>

01:03:55.765 --> 01:04:00.429
<i>They'll learn much more
than we'll know</i>

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:04.064
<i>And I think to myself</i>

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:09.772
<i>What a wonderful world.</i>

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:49.107
Whoa!

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:23.116
By Kylvie,
King of Svitjod,

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:26.644
Houthedy
and Yppor.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:31.388
I summon thee,
God of Gunningap

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.418
- Nifleheim, Kvelge--
- Tim?

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.766
Tim? Is that you?

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:41.463
Tim!

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:49.871
Kvelgemir!

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:01.356
Who summons Odin,

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.483
- Allfather of the gods?
- Shh!

01:06:03.526 --> 01:06:05.926
- G-- Loki?!
- Shh!

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:08.192
- You'll wake the baby.
- Oh, sorry.

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.688
Loki, is that you?

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:13.361
Tim.

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:14.801
What are you doing
in there?

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:17.032
You did
the conjuring ceremony

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:19.041
- by yourself?
- I pay attention.

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:21.805
- Sometimes.
- But you don't have the mask.

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:24.870
- Well, yeah, that's why l--
- Rules are rules, Loki!!

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:26.643
And I specifically-- ow!

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:30.049
Could you just stop lecturing me
for one minute and listen?!

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:33.278
I found the baby.
He's right there.

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:36.348
- That child is strong.
- Mmm.

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.695
Very strong.

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:43.028
I had him before.
I was this close,

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:45.363
but you took my powers
and they got away.

01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:47.392
So, please, father,

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.404
give me my powers

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.736
and I will
give you the mask.

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:57.746
Very well.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.214
Your resourcefulness
pleases me,

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.717
and your mother says
we should be trying

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.720
"positive reinforcement,"

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.722
whatever the Helveti
that is.

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:09.691
So, as a reward,

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:13.183
I shall grant you
a reprieve.

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:16.460
You have until
the sands have fallen.

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:18.467
Oh, hey, hey.
Wait, wait. Hang on.

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.196
- Hmm?
- I want to sync up.

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:23.000
Ready... now!

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:28.375
Don't disappoint me, Loki.
Use your powers wisely

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:31.209
and complete your task.
This truly is

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.238
your final chance!

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:58.135
Tim.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:00.165
What's going on
up there?

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.735
Tim Avery, what are
you doing in there?

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.543
Hmm.
Nosy neighbors.

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:14.151
Ah-- ah-- choo!

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.910
- Guess who?
- No! Ah!

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.913
Tim, snap out of it!

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.279
Baby?

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:44.309
- Is that you?
- Of course it's me.

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.321
What are you
doing up so late?

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:48.550
- And where's Alvey?
- Seriously.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.718
Is that really you?

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.555
No, you idiot.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:56.189
Oh God.
Ah-- what-- l--

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.935
Oh Jeez.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.938
Bro, listen.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:05.964
I'm a god.
I can shape shift.

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.975
I can create stuff
out of nothingness.

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.069
I can alter
the fabric of reality,

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:13.877
so, please, quit being
a knucklehead.

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:16.578
- What do you want from us?
- Oh, don't worry.

01:09:16.618 --> 01:09:19.053
I'm not gonna
hurt you...

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:21.055
yet!

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.354
This baby was born
out of the mask,

01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:25.553
and I want
my mask back!

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.926
Meet me in exactly
one hour.

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:36.603
So you find the mask
and meet me at-- hmm.

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:40.096
Where shall we meet?
Um, how about Red Lobster?

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:42.736
It's always so difficult getting a table
there, especially on Fridays

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:44.541
- when they do that special.
- There's a wick burning.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.639
Well, how about we meet
in an alley in the city?

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.649
- There's a wick--
- Met at one before.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.709
- Sure, it's a little cliché...
- Sir, your--

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:53.745
but it's not so cliché that I think
to myself, "Wow, that's too cliché!"

01:09:53.788 --> 01:09:56.849
- But-- it-- it--
- Meet me in that alley within the hour,

01:09:56.892 --> 01:09:58.757
with the mask,

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:02.457
if you ever want to see
your little monster again.

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:05.490
No!

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:11.399
Alvey! No!

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:29.914
What--
Tim?

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.728
Tim?!

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.753
Alvey?!

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:39.467
Oh God. Tim!

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:41.628
What are you--
what are you--

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.141
Tim.
What are you doing?

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:48.166
What are you doing?

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:54.676
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Get off of me!

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:58.448
Get out of there, Loki!
Where's my son, you mongrel from hell?

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:07.689
Tim! Ah!

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.721
Tonya?!

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:15.898
Tonya!
Oh, it's really you.

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:18.600
- Oh my God.
- Oh God, I'm so sorry.

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:21.439
Betty was right.
You have gone crazy.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:24.378
No, I haven't.
I thought I did, but I didn't.

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:27.772
Where's Alvey?

01:11:28.984 --> 01:11:30.952
- Okay, don't freak out.
- Where's Alvey?!

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:32.886
- You're freaking out.
- Where's my baby?!

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.889
- Loki t-took him.
- Took him?!

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:36.891
Oh my God.
Did you call the police?!

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:38.916
- No, l--
- Oh my God.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.395
Tonya, listen!

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.399
- This is an emergency!
- Tonya!!

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:47.163
- My son is missing--
- No, Tonya, listen!

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:50.069
The police can't help us!
He's the freaking God of Mischief.

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:52.699
All he wants is his mask,
which Otis is wearing.

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:56.006
And if I can just figure
out where Otis is, I can just--

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:58.013
of course!

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:01.505
Our child is missing and you're worried
about the damned dog?!

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.677
This is crazy!

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:05.186
See what I'm
talking about?

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.085
Now, you're gonna
have to trust me

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:10.751
and get in the car, because I know where
Alvey is and I know how to get him back,

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:12.761
because I know the one place
Otis the moose would go.

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:14.763
<i>And they called it</i>

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:18.164
<i>Puppy love.</i>

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:22.599
<i>Oh, I guess they'll
never know.</i>

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:28.743
See there's this really
cute pooch Venus.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.506
Otis?

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:32.878
Otis!

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:35.748
That's not Otis!
That's a green critter.

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.752
I'm sorry, okay?

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:40.516
I've ignored you
and I've been impatient,

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:43.787
but I need you, buddy.
Loki, that guy that made the mask?

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:45.794
He wants it back.
He has Alvey.

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.796
And he's a bad guy,
Otis.

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:50.298
He hates dogs.

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:52.960
He doesn't realize that dogs
are truly man's best friend.

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.969
- Huh?
- You heard me.

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:57.403
You're this man's
best friend.

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.930
But Alvey's my son

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:02.466
which sort of makes you
like his big brother.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:05.844
And when he grows up,
he's gonna be your bestest friend.

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:09.084
But right now,
he needs you

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:11.951
and he needs that mask.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.582
All right.

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.428
So, I guess you're

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:30.461
kinda cute, huh?

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.309
Um, can you, like,

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:36.311
do anything you want,
like me?

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:38.336
I mean, can you
do this?

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:45.649
Wow.

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:47.655
Well, look at you!

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.657
You're just a little
outlaw, ain't you?

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.034
Okay, hombre. Let's see how tough
your rawhide can be.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:22.149
Gotcha.

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:29.694
I like it!

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:32.359
So, you like games, huh?

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.369
Well you'd better watch out

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:37.167
'cause I've got a game
that no one can beat me at.

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:40.770
Super Twister!

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:44.579
It's just around
the corner, right here.

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:46.581
Here we go.

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:49.448
<i>Come on, baby</i>

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.477
<i>Let's do the twist</i>

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:55.285
<i>Come on, baby</i>

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.292
<i>Let's do the twist</i>

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.294
<i>Take me
by my little hand...</i>

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.296
Isn't this fun?

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.321
<i>And go like this</i>

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:07.799
- <i>Ee-oh, twist.</i>
- Hi.

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.599
<i>Baby, baby, twist</i>

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:14.337
<i>Whoo, yeah.</i>

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:16.936
- Ah!
- <i>Just like this</i>

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:20.005
<i>Come on, little miss</i>

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:23.848
<i>And do the twist.</i>

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:26.286
- No, that's cheating.
- <i>Let's all do it.</i>

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:30.816
Whoa!

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:32.850
Whoa!

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:39.931
No fair! That crash
threw me. Rematch!

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.236
Okay, you give me Alvey,

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.111
and the mask is yours.

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:11.823
I can't let go.
I've grown attached.

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:13.835
- Alvey!
- Hey, we had a deal!

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:16.633
I'm the God of friggin' Mischief,
what did you expect?

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:51.739
- Huh.
- Hey, Loki.

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.764
Honey, you look hot.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:57.040
Give me back my son!

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.070
Um... no.

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:04.277
Honey, I think
it's time we trade up.

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.266
Buckle up, baby.

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.682
Listen to Loki, kid.

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:38.413
Dads are overrated
and I speak from experience.

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:43.055
Ah, there's nothing
like a Sunday drive.

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:47.394
You wanna have some fun,
kid, you stick with me.

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.567
All right. It's time
to lose them for good.

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:13.386
Oh, look out,
look out, look out!

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:16.451
Yahoo!

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:27.133
Whoa!!

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:31.804
Hey, babe, look.
No hands. I'm kidding.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.467
Let's just
finish this.

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:39.641
Now, where did he go?

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:42.650
- Hmm.
- Uh, honey?

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.914
I think, maybe, there?

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:03.401
And here he is, folks,

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:06.669
the failure of Fringe City,

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:11.975
Yes, it's
Tim "No-win" Avery!

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.709
Tim, it's Alvey.
I'm gonna go get him.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.741
Kick his can, honey.

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:34.299
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:39.298
Hi, baby.
Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:42.833
Oh, yeah? Well, jump
like a grasshopper

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:45.472
and stink like a skunk!

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.973
Caught me
with my mouth open!

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:51.281
You can't fight me
if you're locked in a trunk.

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:52.809
Huh?

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:59.525
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.936
Let's get out of this dump.
Come on.

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:16.137
And Loki said, "Let there
be a brick wall!"

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:18.874
And there was!

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.979
Okay!

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:24.850
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:30.391
Say hello to my
little friend!

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:38.697
Tim! Tim!

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.537
Here's Loki!

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:53.904
Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim,
T-T-T-T-T--

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.759
Wait.

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.264
This is a waste
of time.

01:21:10.298 --> 01:21:12.528
We're evenly-matched
opponents.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:16.861
I think we should
let the kid decide.

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:20.474
Why, that's
a swell idea.

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:30.443
Alvey, this is
your decision.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:33.580
- Pick me, pick me!
- Alvey?

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:38.559
- I'm your real dad!
- Come on, you little devil. Let's play!

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:41.721
- Come on, Alvey.
- Alvey.

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.267
Alvey?

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:52.034
- Yeah, that's right.
- Tim!

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:54.735
Son.

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:13.251
Alvey,
look at me.

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:15.559
It's your dad.

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.497
There's no more
superpowers.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.792
I know at first
I was kind of a jerk.

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:25.166
I didn't know
how to handle a son,

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:27.936
but you helped me
grow up.

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:30.103
And I want
to repay you

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:32.136
by helping you
grow up.

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.713
I love you.

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:41.548
Come on.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.896
- Da-da.
- Oh, Alvey.

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:51.421
It's my son.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.703
Yes.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.766
I just wanted
a friend.

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:48.580
Push! Push!

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:05.400
Huh?

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:42.774
Off the throne.
He's off the throne. That's not good.

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.574
Your time is up, son.

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:48.104
As expected, you failed
in your promise.

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:50.117
You failed in your quest.

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:54.212
You are, in every sense
of the word,

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.985
- a failure.
- And I thought your dad was mean.

01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:58.993
Hey, we both knew
it would end like this, right?

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:01.587
You always set me up to fail.
At least in that respect,

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:04.189
- I'm living up to your expectations.
- Silence!

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:07.463
You've brought me
much pain, Loki.

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:12.531
Right back
at you, Dad.

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:14.337
- Hey!
- Tim, no!

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.707
Hang on just a minute,
Grizzly Adams.

01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:19.440
I don't know how things work
in the god world,

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:22.882
but you're his father,
he's your son.

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:26.114
And even if you banish him,
he's still gonna be your son.

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:31.992
There is nothing more important
in this entire universe

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:34.426
than your relationship
with your family,

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.123
especially
if you're immortal.

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:38.632
You're like 1,000,
he's like 800,

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.395
so you might as well
get things right now

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:42.960
and enjoy the rest
of your eternal life.

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:46.666
Here's the thing.
Just take it.

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:53.513
Okay?
Loosen up.

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.662
Come on, son.
Let's go home.

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.633
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:17.094
Godspeed.

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:24.845
Maybe now, I can help you
patch things up with Mom?

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:26.608
Don't push it.

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:45.963
A baby and a dog competing
for Dad's attention--

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.298
I love it.

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:52.067
Simple, but it's--
it's got--

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:55.132
- Spark?
- Yes.

01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:57.406
Where did you
get the idea?

01:26:57.445 --> 01:27:02.348
Well, I just kind of quit
trying so hard and...

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.979
the idea just
came to me.

01:27:07.021 --> 01:27:09.319
It's great.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.345
Yay! Yay!

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.482
Honey, oh.

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:46.618
That was such
a good show!

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:50.358
But I think you might
need to add another character.

01:27:50.398 --> 01:27:52.059
What?

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.697
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:28:02.377 --> 01:28:04.675
What do you think about that,
Double A?

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:06.737
A little brother
or sister?

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.681
How does
that sound?
