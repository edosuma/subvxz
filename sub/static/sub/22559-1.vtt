Welcome to Spontaneous Travel.

01:46.882 --> 01:48.128
How may I assist you?

01:48.130 --> 01:50.560
I have an overnight
delivery for an Amy Tyler.

01:50.562 --> 01:52.671
Oh, that'll be the
productivity pod on your left.

01:52.673 --> 01:53.952
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:53.954 --> 01:54.911
(mutters) Start-ups.

01:54.913 --> 01:56.510
Have a spontaneous day!

01:56.512 --> 01:57.791
(man) Yes, sir, I can imagine

01:57.793 --> 01:59.646
it's not very fun in Syria right now,

01:59.648 --> 02:03.262
but traveler's insurance does
not cover political unrest.

02:03.264 --> 02:05.245
Amy Tyler?

02:05.247 --> 02:06.878
Can you hold on a mo-mo?

02:06.880 --> 02:08.124
Can I help you?

02:08.126 --> 02:10.044
Yeah, urgent for Amy Tyler?

02:10.047 --> 02:11.677
I'll sign.

02:11.679 --> 02:14.012
Amy, it's here!

02:14.014 --> 02:15.836
Just in time.

02:15.838 --> 02:17.947
If I'm not careful, you could replace me.

02:17.949 --> 02:20.571
Oh, I could never be a ginger. Here.

02:20.573 --> 02:21.532
Oh!

02:21.534 --> 02:24.123
♪♪

02:24.125 --> 02:27.611
(gasps) Robert, you are a life saver.

02:27.613 --> 02:29.465
Okay, my turn. The
Wainwrights are in Sweden?

02:29.467 --> 02:30.969
You mean Syria?

02:30.971 --> 02:32.025
That, and then there's also a thingy.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.370
A military coup?

02:33.372 --> 02:34.873
I don't know, listening
is not really my thing.

02:34.875 --> 02:35.961
What about reading or watching the news?

02:35.963 --> 02:37.144
Oh, gross.

02:37.146 --> 02:39.160
Get Phillipe at Hotel Plaka on the line.

02:39.162 --> 02:40.951
I'll take care of the rest.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.552
That's why you're gonna
own this place someday.

02:42.554 --> 02:44.535
No, that's why I'll
sell this place someday.

02:44.537 --> 02:48.086
Mr. Wainwright, it's Amy
from Spontaneous Travel.

02:48.088 --> 02:51.413
I understand you're having a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

02:51.415 --> 02:54.231
Let's see if we can't
find you a better one.

02:54.233 --> 02:57.397
Yes, sir, I'm looking at
a direct flight to Athens

02:57.399 --> 02:59.157
that leaves in two hours,

02:59.159 --> 03:01.685
and we will transfer your
hotel reservation at no charge.

03:01.687 --> 03:03.028
I've got Phillipe on the other line,

03:03.030 --> 03:04.756
who will take great care of you.

03:04.758 --> 03:06.932
Direct Message me if you
need anything after hours.

03:06.934 --> 03:10.227
No, thank you for choosing
Spontaneous Travel,

03:10.229 --> 03:11.508
where we plan...

03:11.510 --> 03:13.363
(all) ...for you to improvise.

03:13.365 --> 03:15.505
You have every luxury hotel on speed dial,

03:15.507 --> 03:17.426
and I'm shooting my videos
in an active coffee shop.

03:17.428 --> 03:19.057
Vanilla hemp latte for Sandra!

03:19.059 --> 03:20.658
Right here!

03:20.660 --> 03:22.224
You don't spend three
years making travel videos

03:22.226 --> 03:23.952
in Europe without getting
to know a few hotel managers.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.768
Yeah, and you don't create
a start-up travel agency.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.113
Global Concierge.

03:28.115 --> 03:29.745
Ugh, global concierge,

03:29.747 --> 03:32.273
without it being more than a few.

03:32.275 --> 03:33.648
All I'm saying is you could hook a girl up.

03:33.650 --> 03:35.184
Wait, is that why you called?

03:35.186 --> 03:36.174
- No!
- No.

03:36.176 --> 03:37.999
We wanna know if it came.

03:38.001 --> 03:40.431
You mean, this?

03:40.433 --> 03:42.063
- (chuckling)
- Aaah!

03:42.065 --> 03:43.950
Yay, what are we celebrating?

03:43.952 --> 03:45.870
Take a bow, Robert.

03:45.872 --> 03:49.069
I'd like to thank the Academy
and my husband, Anderson Cooper.

03:49.071 --> 03:51.149
I still can't believe you got
a passport in less than a week.

03:51.151 --> 03:53.005
Who knew the Department
of State was on Grindr?

03:53.007 --> 03:54.316
Ding-ding goes the trolley.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.756
That makes so much sense.

03:55.758 --> 03:57.485
<i>And Josh still has no idea?</i>

03:57.487 --> 04:00.012
Nope! I cleared the dates with his firm,

04:00.014 --> 04:02.091
booked the flights, even
double-dipped on a few discounts

04:02.093 --> 04:03.307
because we have different last names.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.099
I planned it perfectly.

04:05.101 --> 04:06.441
Except, you forgot to check

04:06.443 --> 04:08.169
if your boyfriend's passport had expired.

04:08.171 --> 04:10.122
That's why I have Robert.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.040
Did you confirm the
Wainwrights' Athens flight?

04:12.042 --> 04:13.512
Oh, Ames, that's so five minutes ago.

04:13.514 --> 04:15.528
I even got them a Groupon
for the Aeropostale.

04:15.530 --> 04:16.776
You mean the Acropolis, right?

04:16.778 --> 04:20.231
Your trip with Josh is gonna be so amazing!

04:20.233 --> 04:21.607
It's gonna be perfect, Amy.

04:21.608 --> 04:23.719
You could just chill
out and focus on seeing

04:23.721 --> 04:25.320
all your favorite places in the world.

04:25.322 --> 04:26.662
With your favorite man in the world!

04:26.664 --> 04:27.878
Barf!

04:27.880 --> 04:29.127
That sounds so cheesy,

04:29.129 --> 04:31.270
but so amazing that I don't care!

04:31.272 --> 04:33.191
And Josh has always talked about proposing

04:33.193 --> 04:35.750
in front of that fountain
where his grandparents met.

04:35.752 --> 04:36.741
I told you about that?

04:36.743 --> 04:38.405
(all) Only ten times.

04:38.407 --> 04:39.909
I hope he can just take the hint.

04:39.911 --> 04:41.828
- Men can be so oblivious.
- You're telling me.

04:41.830 --> 04:44.260
I reminded him about dinner
tonight, and he tried to pretend

04:44.262 --> 04:46.084
he had something really important planned,

04:46.086 --> 04:47.780
but I am pretty sure he just forgot.

04:47.782 --> 04:50.371
Or maybe he's planning a
little surprise of his own.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.196
No.

04:52.198 --> 04:53.923
You think?

04:53.925 --> 04:55.906
Oh, but he knows I hate surprises.

04:55.908 --> 04:58.051
<i>Honey, you've cashed
in thousands of dollars</i>

04:58.053 --> 04:59.810
<i>and dozens of favors for this trip.</i>

04:59.812 --> 05:02.594
In a month, I better see
two carats, or a new man.

05:02.596 --> 05:04.480
Oh, my gosh, I'd love to plan your wedding.

05:04.482 --> 05:06.337
- Ew, no!
- Absolutely not!

05:06.339 --> 05:07.873
All right, all right, all right.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.143
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

05:10.145 --> 05:12.448
Right now, I just have to focus
on getting to dinner on time.

05:12.450 --> 05:13.919
You mean five minutes ago?

05:13.921 --> 05:15.391
Crap, yes. Robert...

05:15.393 --> 05:16.290
Already Uber-ing.

05:23.521 --> 05:24.990
Oh, sorry I'm late.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.142
Oh, um...

05:26.144 --> 05:29.500
I was just finishing up your surprise.

05:29.502 --> 05:31.357
Amy Tyler, late for something.

05:31.359 --> 05:32.700
The apocalypse is nigh.

05:32.702 --> 05:35.099
For our anniversary, grumpy pants.

05:35.101 --> 05:36.603
Yeah, Amy, about that, um...

05:36.605 --> 05:38.043
Can I just tell you what your surprise is?

05:38.045 --> 05:39.131
Well, I think we really need to...

05:39.133 --> 05:40.251
And I cannot keep a secret so...

05:40.253 --> 05:41.853
Amy! Just...

05:43.293 --> 05:45.181
Yeah, I'm just gonna give you two a minute.

05:48.540 --> 05:53.752
Amy, you're a great girl,
and we've had a lot of fun...

05:53.754 --> 05:55.385
But this doesn't sound very fun.

05:55.387 --> 05:57.240
I just feel like things
are moving too fast.

05:57.242 --> 05:58.777
We've been dating for two years.

05:58.779 --> 06:00.568
- I know.
- We live together.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.071
Exactly.

06:02.073 --> 06:03.382
I'm just not ready for
this kind of commitment.

06:03.384 --> 06:05.399
Well... I'm not saying

06:05.401 --> 06:06.422
we have to get married right now.

06:06.424 --> 06:07.831
Oh, thank God.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.942
(chuckling) Great! Good.

06:09.944 --> 06:11.959
No, I'm glad we're on
the same page with this,

06:11.961 --> 06:13.494
because I feel like you're always making

06:13.496 --> 06:15.605
these big, romantic
gestures and wanting to spend

06:15.607 --> 06:17.046
all this time and money together.

06:17.048 --> 06:20.376
And I just don't want to do that anymore.

06:22.518 --> 06:24.307
So...

06:24.309 --> 06:25.909
Ahh. Good.

06:25.911 --> 06:27.988
Whew! Heh.

06:27.990 --> 06:31.411
Uh, that went much better
than I thought it would.

06:31.413 --> 06:33.206
What did you want to talk about?

06:34.997 --> 06:37.745
I booked us a... a two-week trip
to Europe for our anniversary.

06:37.747 --> 06:40.689
What? Are you... Are you crazy?

06:40.691 --> 06:42.001
I... I can't take two weeks off.

06:42.003 --> 06:43.664
No, I cleared it with your boss.

06:43.666 --> 06:44.850
You talked to Mike behind my back?

06:44.852 --> 06:46.672
That's how a surprise works.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.432
What am I gonna do in Europe for two weeks?

06:48.434 --> 06:50.383
You love Europe.

06:50.385 --> 06:52.399
You studied abroad in Amsterdam.

06:52.401 --> 06:54.031
We met dancing in Ibiza.

06:54.033 --> 06:55.664
You've always wanted to
propose at the fountain

06:55.666 --> 06:56.911
where your grandparents met.

06:56.913 --> 06:59.054
Amy, I told you that
on, like, our third date.

06:59.056 --> 07:00.622
I thought it was romantic.

07:00.624 --> 07:01.998
I thought it would get me laid.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.560
Just gonna take another
lap around, no rush.

07:06.671 --> 07:09.357
Well, I wish I'd known that
before I fell in love with you.

07:09.359 --> 07:11.725
I wish I'd known that
before we moved in together.

07:11.727 --> 07:13.932
And I really wish I'd known that

07:13.934 --> 07:15.499
before I booked us a non-refundable

07:15.501 --> 07:18.123
two-week trip to Europe
for our anniversary.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.363
Amy, I think a vacation is a great idea.

07:20.365 --> 07:22.253
You know, just maybe...

07:24.749 --> 07:27.082
...from each other.

07:27.084 --> 07:28.778
Are you breaking up with me?

07:28.780 --> 07:29.834
No!

07:29.836 --> 07:32.137
I mean...

07:32.139 --> 07:34.057
if that's what you want.

07:34.059 --> 07:35.656
What I want is to be with someone

07:35.658 --> 07:37.897
who sees a future with me.

07:37.899 --> 07:39.307
I'm not a fortune teller, Amy.

07:41.513 --> 07:44.199
Well, at least I already started packing.

07:44.201 --> 07:45.994
Amy, wait.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.510
What are you gonna do with that ticket?

07:49.512 --> 07:52.486
So maybe I can get it
exchanged for another time?

07:52.488 --> 07:54.341
(Marcie) I am gonna taze his ass!

07:54.343 --> 07:55.878
(Sandra) Amy, you can
stay as long as you need.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.572
Why didn't you make <i>him</i> move out?

07:57.574 --> 07:59.110
Eff this, I'm ordering a pizza.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.187
We've earned it. You've
gotta still go, Ames.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.845
I would kill to see Turkey!
Literally murder bodies.

08:03.847 --> 08:05.027
The girl just got dumped.

08:05.029 --> 08:06.147
What's she gonna do in Turkey?

08:06.149 --> 08:07.683
Well, we don't know his name yet.

08:07.685 --> 08:09.091
Marcie's right.

08:09.093 --> 08:10.690
I can't go anywhere right now.

08:10.692 --> 08:12.931
I don't even have a place to live.

08:12.933 --> 08:15.107
It was a stupid idea anyway.

08:15.109 --> 08:17.026
Amy, you dropped, like,
thousands on this trip.

08:17.028 --> 08:18.241
Of your own money.

08:18.243 --> 08:19.201
At least give me the tickets.

08:19.203 --> 08:20.609
You don't understand.

08:20.611 --> 08:22.208
They're nontransferable.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.257
Our names are on everything.

08:24.259 --> 08:27.489
Plane tickets, hotels, tours,
even dinner reservations.

08:27.491 --> 08:29.024
I can't go without him.

08:29.026 --> 08:31.839
Amy, I am so sorry,

08:31.841 --> 08:33.183
but we're your girls, okay?

08:33.184 --> 08:35.071
- And we're here for you.
- For anything.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.861
Can we do a gluten-free
crust? I'm on a thing.

08:36.864 --> 08:39.102
The next time that Josh
Merit parks anywhere,

08:39.105 --> 08:41.373
I'm gonna be there to turn that meter off

08:41.375 --> 08:42.717
and ticket his ass.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.157
Wait, you can do that?

08:44.159 --> 08:45.341
But you have to forget about him, okay?

08:45.343 --> 08:46.652
Forget about this trip.

08:46.654 --> 08:48.284
- (phone alert)
- Maybe that's him!

08:48.286 --> 08:50.301
What part of "take her
damn phone away from her"

08:50.303 --> 08:51.516
did you not understand?

08:51.518 --> 08:52.957
Please, she's too sober to drunk dial.

08:52.959 --> 08:54.363
Bitch, you are not a Breathalyzer.

08:54.365 --> 08:56.283
He changed our relationship status.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.692
- What?!
- Ouch.

08:57.694 --> 08:59.003
He listed himself as single,

08:59.005 --> 09:01.629
so now it says I'm single, too.

09:03.356 --> 09:04.538
I guess it's official.

09:04.540 --> 09:05.722
And it wasn't official when he turned down

09:05.724 --> 09:07.354
an all-expenses-paid
vacation?

09:07.356 --> 09:09.369
Yeah, he should have at least
led her on for another two weeks

09:09.371 --> 09:11.194
and gotten a free trip
and vacation sex out of it.

09:11.196 --> 09:12.536
- What?
- Girl, I'm gon...

09:12.538 --> 09:14.104
He changed his profile picture.

09:14.106 --> 09:15.064
Sandra, I need your computer.

09:15.066 --> 09:16.312
No, Amy, calm down.

09:16.314 --> 09:17.879
What if it's with a new girl?

09:17.881 --> 09:19.096
The new picture won't load on my phone.

09:19.098 --> 09:20.088
Girl, take the hint!

09:20.090 --> 09:21.559
Okay! Okay, grabby.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.808
Pizza's on you, then.

09:22.810 --> 09:24.919
Why can't I find him on here?

09:24.921 --> 09:26.712
Did he block me?!

09:26.714 --> 09:27.830
Breathe.

09:27.832 --> 09:29.271
It's logged into <i>my</i> profile.

09:29.273 --> 09:30.391
I am not friends with the A-hole

09:30.393 --> 09:31.511
formally known as your boyfriend.

09:31.513 --> 09:33.110
Okay, just search for him.

09:33.112 --> 09:35.253
And once you're done,
we can go to the club.

09:35.255 --> 09:38.070
He changed his picture, so
I can't tell which one he is.

09:38.072 --> 09:40.884
Whoa, there must be at least
a dozen Josh Merits on here.

09:40.886 --> 09:42.835
Okay, I think this one's him.

09:42.837 --> 09:45.011
Okay, see? No new girl.

09:45.013 --> 09:46.516
Just a bunch of
douche-nozzles doing shots.

09:46.518 --> 09:48.564
Wait, no, go back!

09:48.566 --> 09:50.035
No, this is him, Sandra.

09:50.037 --> 09:51.827
We don't need to look at
a bunch of random guys.

09:51.829 --> 09:52.915
Yes, you do!

09:52.917 --> 09:54.290
- Huh?
- What?

09:54.292 --> 09:57.266
You need a new Josh Merit.

09:57.268 --> 09:58.609
Now, I know you're not thinking

09:58.611 --> 10:00.434
what I think you're thinking.

10:00.436 --> 10:02.833
Honestly, this is the
best idea I've ever had.

10:02.835 --> 10:05.169
(chuckling) No, no, no.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.257
Absolutely not!

10:06.259 --> 10:07.024
Come on!

10:07.026 --> 10:08.336
The best way to get over one guy

10:08.338 --> 10:09.743
is to get on top of another one.

10:09.745 --> 10:10.992
This one time, it's a good plan.

10:10.994 --> 10:12.527
I mean, think about it.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.031
You've already prepaid for this two-week

10:14.033 --> 10:16.431
dream vacation with a Josh Merit.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.671
You can't change the tickets,
but you can change the guy.

10:18.673 --> 10:20.303
This is ridiculous.

10:20.305 --> 10:21.709
This way, you get to keep your trip,

10:21.711 --> 10:24.494
your plan, and maybe even find a rebound.

10:24.496 --> 10:26.509
You'll never have to worry
about saying the wrong name.

10:26.511 --> 10:29.165
I am not taking a stranger to Europe!

10:29.167 --> 10:30.732
Isn't that what you do for a living?

10:30.734 --> 10:32.077
Well, what if he's a total creep? Hmm?

10:32.079 --> 10:33.708
Or a knife-stabber.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.883
This is the whole reason
that I stopped making videos

10:35.885 --> 10:37.932
and dealt with other people's travel.

10:37.934 --> 10:40.715
People are unpredictable.

10:40.717 --> 10:42.283
Like Josh.

10:42.285 --> 10:43.401
(patrons chattering)

10:43.403 --> 10:44.586
Okay.

10:44.588 --> 10:46.185
Do you wanna make a pro and con list?

10:46.187 --> 10:47.177
No.

10:47.179 --> 10:48.329
But you love pro and con lists.

10:48.331 --> 10:50.314
- I do.
- Okay.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.842
You get to relive Amy's Adventures.

10:52.844 --> 10:54.760
I haven't vlogged in years.

10:54.762 --> 10:56.585
- Meet new people!
- I hate people.

10:56.587 --> 10:58.023
Well, we'll run a background check.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.465
Make sure you're safe.

10:59.467 --> 11:00.615
You're a parking enforcement officer.

11:00.617 --> 11:01.895
I still work for the state.

11:01.897 --> 11:03.495
And we can figure out
where these guys hang out

11:03.497 --> 11:05.224
and go window shopping.

11:05.226 --> 11:07.750
I can't just write a
bunch of random men online.

11:07.752 --> 11:09.447
What would I even say?

11:09.449 --> 11:10.757
"Hi, we've never met,

11:10.759 --> 11:12.646
"but you've won a free trip to Europe!

11:12.648 --> 11:14.438
"And also, there's a Nigerian prince

11:14.440 --> 11:16.196
with an exciting financial opportunity."

11:16.198 --> 11:18.085
Who is gonna turn down a free trip?

11:18.087 --> 11:20.197
Better yet, offer them
a deal on the tickets

11:20.199 --> 11:21.668
and make some of your money back.

11:21.670 --> 11:22.853
What am I, Living Social?

11:22.855 --> 11:24.067
No, you're "Living Single."

11:24.069 --> 11:25.540
All you have to do

11:25.542 --> 11:27.652
is write a few Josh Merits.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.900
We'll take care of the rest.

11:28.902 --> 11:30.915
Guys, come on.

11:30.917 --> 11:32.290
Do you really expect me

11:32.292 --> 11:34.370
to contact every guy on the Internet

11:34.372 --> 11:35.489
with my ex's name?

11:35.491 --> 11:36.961
No!

11:36.963 --> 11:38.977
Just the cute ones.

11:38.979 --> 11:40.292
I heard that!

11:43.779 --> 11:45.760
- Where do we start?
- Yes!

11:47.010 --> 11:49.024
(Marcie) You don't waste any time.

11:49.026 --> 11:50.399
Yeah, maybe this was a bad idea.

11:50.401 --> 11:51.519
Uh,
d-d-d... no.

11:51.521 --> 11:52.574
- Hold on!
- No, no.

- (Marcie) Who?
- Our first Josh Merit.

11:55.872 --> 11:57.695
I posted that I was
looking to book Josh Merit

11:57.697 --> 12:00.126
on my show, the Internet
took care of the rest.

12:00.128 --> 12:01.470
You can find anyone.

12:01.472 --> 12:03.102
Except a sponsor for her YouTube channel.

12:03.104 --> 12:04.413
Focus, ladies.

12:04.415 --> 12:05.981
He's a 30-year-old
musician from Tennessee

12:05.983 --> 12:07.229
with a body like Ryan Lochte

12:07.231 --> 12:08.285
and a voice that sounds like rainbows.

12:08.287 --> 12:10.621
He is the definition of a rebound,

12:10.623 --> 12:11.867
and he's standing right over there.

12:11.869 --> 12:13.148
Ladies and ladies,

12:13.150 --> 12:16.317
please welcome our first
contestant, Josh Merit.

12:17.853 --> 12:19.707
How old is that photo?

12:19.709 --> 12:22.013
Girl, if you don't go over there, I will.

12:24.251 --> 12:26.074
I... I... I can do it!

12:26.076 --> 12:27.833
OMG! Josh...

12:27.835 --> 12:29.337
- Yeah, Abby?
- I love you.

12:29.339 --> 12:30.426
Yeah.

12:30.428 --> 12:32.792
Are you gonna play "Falling" tonight?

12:32.794 --> 12:34.105
Yeah, I think I can make that happen.

12:34.107 --> 12:36.631
(squeals and laughs)

12:36.633 --> 12:38.392
Can we take a picture together?

12:38.394 --> 12:39.480
Can you?

12:39.482 --> 12:41.240
Uh...

12:41.242 --> 12:42.519
On three, say,

12:42.521 --> 12:44.823
"I mistake attention for love."

12:44.825 --> 12:46.519
(camera clicks)

12:46.521 --> 12:47.990
All right.

12:47.992 --> 12:49.365
I'm your biggest fan.

12:49.367 --> 12:50.326
See you after the show, Josh.

12:50.328 --> 12:51.737
Yeah, okay, thanks.

12:54.424 --> 12:55.924
Sorry about that. Do you...

12:55.926 --> 12:57.237
Did you wanna get a photo?

12:57.239 --> 12:58.548
Oh, God, no, heh.

12:58.550 --> 12:59.955
- I'm sorry.
- No, okay.

12:59.957 --> 13:01.587
It's... it's cool.

13:01.589 --> 13:04.467
I personally prefer to
be heard and not seen.

13:04.469 --> 13:06.675
So how long have you been playing?

13:06.677 --> 13:08.499
Oh, wow, you really did not come here

13:08.501 --> 13:09.714
to hear me play music, did you?

13:09.716 --> 13:12.498
No. I'm sorry.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.843
No, no, don't worry about it.

13:13.845 --> 13:16.274
It's, uh, it's actually refreshing.

13:16.276 --> 13:17.905
And who knows?

13:17.907 --> 13:19.825
Maybe Josh Merit can make
a fan out of you tonight.

13:19.827 --> 13:22.672
Yeah, you're gonna have to work really hard

13:22.674 --> 13:25.775
to make me a fan of Josh Merit right now.

13:25.777 --> 13:27.887
You know, um, I'm usually surrounded

13:27.889 --> 13:30.639
by either fans or crazies.

13:30.641 --> 13:33.999
But it's nice to meet,
you know, someone like you.

13:34.001 --> 13:34.897
(chuckles)

13:36.241 --> 13:37.550
You know, sometimes I just fantasize

13:37.552 --> 13:39.470
about just taking a trip.

13:39.472 --> 13:42.222
You know, just... get away from it all.

13:42.224 --> 13:44.045
Well, it... it's funny
you should mention that

13:44.047 --> 13:46.541
because, um, this is crazy, actually.

13:46.543 --> 13:48.844

17:05.487 --> 17:08.172
the buttocks of a thoroughbred stallion.

17:08.174 --> 17:09.132
Wait, he's looking over here!

17:09.134 --> 17:10.508
Oh, okay.

17:10.510 --> 17:12.364
What are you doing?

17:12.366 --> 17:14.411
He doesn't know what you
look like, crazy pants.

17:14.413 --> 17:17.162
Okay, your flight leaves in 24 hours, Amy.

17:17.164 --> 17:18.314
You can't afford to be picky.

17:18.316 --> 17:19.787
Maybe I just shouldn't go.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.122
No! He wrote back and
said he was interested.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.777
We've seen every Josh Merit in the city.

17:24.779 --> 17:25.897
This Josh'll do.

17:25.900 --> 17:27.082
And if it doesn't work out,

17:27.084 --> 17:28.906
you can just give him his
return ticket and then go meet

17:28.908 --> 17:30.474
some mysterious stranger
who doesn't speak English

17:30.476 --> 17:33.352
but makes you orgasm in five languages.

17:33.354 --> 17:35.338
- (sighs)
- I worry about you.

17:36.587 --> 17:38.119
- Me too.
- Okay...

17:38.121 --> 17:40.934
Fifty Shades of Gross
here has got it right.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.951
You need this, Amy.

17:42.953 --> 17:45.223
Besides, whatever Josh
you take with you to Europe

17:45.225 --> 17:46.887
is better than the one you had.

17:46.889 --> 17:49.704
♪♪

18:18.819 --> 18:22.208
Uh, oh. Oh, uh, Josh?

18:22.210 --> 18:24.064
I still think you should have
gone with Personal Trainer Josh.

18:24.066 --> 18:26.431
Well, this is the only one
that said yes to my offer, okay?

18:26.433 --> 18:28.672
Wow, even my standards
are higher than that.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.624
This Josh is single, drug-free,

18:30.626 --> 18:32.000
and as far as we know,
not a knife-stabber.

18:32.002 --> 18:34.111
Okay? We're lucky he said yes.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.766
Those are impressive credentials for any
man from the Bay Area, regardless of name.

18:36.768 --> 18:38.719
I mean, if the state trusts
him to teach children,

18:38.721 --> 18:39.933
I'm gonna trust him with you.

18:39.935 --> 18:42.109
Not to mention, he has a valid passport.

18:42.111 --> 18:43.104
And a great butt.

18:44.447 --> 18:46.493
What? It's important!

18:46.495 --> 18:48.572
Okay, remember we have to pretend
like we've never seen him before.

18:48.574 --> 18:50.332
So, put the sign back up and play it up.

18:50.334 --> 18:52.027
And, Sandra, try not to hit on him.

18:52.029 --> 18:54.235
But how will I resist his unemployed,

18:54.237 --> 18:56.027
scooter-riding charm?

18:56.029 --> 18:58.490
Regardless of anything,
I just want you to know

18:58.492 --> 19:00.122
I'm really proud of you, Amy.

19:00.124 --> 19:02.490
I mean, you could've stayed home sulking

19:02.492 --> 19:05.241
and missed out on a trip of
a lifetime, but you didn't.

19:05.243 --> 19:06.426
I know.

19:06.428 --> 19:09.305
I mean, this is crazy,

19:09.307 --> 19:11.065
but I'm actually kind of excited about it.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.177
And at least someone's
getting to use the ticket.

19:13.179 --> 19:14.776
He seems like he really needs it.

19:14.778 --> 19:15.927
You know who really needs it...

19:15.929 --> 19:17.048
Wait, guys! I think this is him.

19:17.050 --> 19:18.230
Play it cool.

19:36.982 --> 19:37.940
I'm Joshua.

19:37.942 --> 19:39.381

You couldn't have shaved?

19:41.270 --> 19:42.644
Or at least showered?

19:42.646 --> 19:43.924
Uh, sorry.

19:43.926 --> 19:45.843
Thought we were gonna be
on a plane for 12 hours.

19:45.845 --> 19:46.995
Don't worry about her.

19:46.997 --> 19:47.986
I don't mind the scruff, heh.

19:47.988 --> 19:48.945
Thank you.

19:48.947 --> 19:50.739
Uh, Amy, I'm guessing?

19:50.741 --> 19:53.202
No, it's nice to meet you though, Joshua.

I'm Sandra.

Who will be staying here, with me.

This is Amy.

Hi, Amy.

Hi, Amy. Uh, Jo...

Uh, we already did that.

20:08.850 --> 20:10.735
Um, can I help you with your bag?

20:10.737 --> 20:13.358
Uh, do you have a bag?

20:13.360 --> 20:14.895
Uh, didn't have much of a heads-up,

20:14.897 --> 20:17.294
so just threw everything
in a backpack and left.

20:17.296 --> 20:19.118
Have you ever tried a rolling bag?

20:19.120 --> 20:21.422
Have you ever tried not
micromanaging other people?

20:21.424 --> 20:23.437
Okay, Joshua.

20:23.439 --> 20:24.909
See, the thing is, Amy here,

20:24.911 --> 20:26.284
she's calling all the shots.

20:26.286 --> 20:27.724
Except in the bedroom.

20:27.726 --> 20:28.811
Then she likes a little dominance,

20:28.813 --> 20:29.771
and her safe word is "stop."

20:29.773 --> 20:30.987
Guys...

20:30.989 --> 20:32.971
Everything is in both of your names,

20:32.973 --> 20:34.859
so if you can't play nice,
you may as well walk away now

20:34.861 --> 20:36.459
or you'll be limping away later.

20:36.461 --> 20:37.643
You don't have to play nice with me.

20:37.645 --> 20:38.762
I like limping away.

20:38.764 --> 20:40.650
- Seriously?
- Wow, heh.

20:40.652 --> 20:43.403
Maybe I should get my return
ticket now for safe-keeping, huh?

20:43.405 --> 20:44.554
Sure!

20:44.556 --> 20:45.930
And if you wouldn't mind waiting

20:45.932 --> 20:47.145
until at least Sunday to dump me.

20:47.147 --> 20:48.360
I've already been through
that once this week.

20:48.362 --> 20:51.081
Okay? Everybody happy?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.873
Great. Here's your boarding pass.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.791
I'm glad you came, I'll
see you on the plane.

20:54.793 --> 20:56.519
Amy...

20:56.521 --> 20:58.151
(indistinct PA announcement)

20:58.153 --> 21:00.454
Is she okay?

21:00.456 --> 21:03.302
Don't worry, she's much
more friendly at 30,000 feet.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.414
And don't forget... any funny business,

21:05.416 --> 21:07.654
I won't be afraid to use this.

21:07.656 --> 21:09.029
Did that say Parking Enforcement?

21:09.031 --> 21:11.430
Just get on the damn plane!

21:11.432 --> 21:14.181
Okay, folks, I need two lines!

21:14.183 --> 21:16.228
Okay, have your documentation out.

21:16.230 --> 21:17.188
I'm not going anywhere.

21:17.190 --> 21:19.171
Next!

21:19.173 --> 21:20.515
Sir, step up, please.

21:20.517 --> 21:21.958
Sorry. It's, uh, early for me.

21:27.717 --> 21:29.219
Hmm...

21:29.221 --> 21:30.435
The name on your boarding pass

21:30.437 --> 21:32.418
doesn't match the name on your passport.

21:32.420 --> 21:33.573
Uh... let me see.

21:35.940 --> 21:38.337
No. Says right there, "Josh Merit."

21:38.339 --> 21:41.216
It says <i>Michael</i> Joshua Merit.

21:41.218 --> 21:43.553
Yeah, so Michael Josh Merit.

21:43.555 --> 21:44.832
That don't fly.

21:44.834 --> 21:46.111
Well I mean, not flying

21:46.113 --> 21:48.064
is not really an option right now, so...

21:48.066 --> 21:50.878
I won't allow you to board
with the wrong documentation.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.734
Are you serious?

21:52.736 --> 21:54.719
There's nothing wrong
with my documentation.

21:54.721 --> 21:55.967
Do I look like a terrorist?

21:55.969 --> 21:58.142
You wanna check up my butt, see
if there's anything up there?

21:58.144 --> 21:59.102
Oh, I know something's up there,

21:59.104 --> 22:00.221
but you want me to find out.

22:00.223 --> 22:01.980
Ah, you must say that to all the guys.

22:01.982 --> 22:03.868
I'm sorry. Is... Is there a problem?

22:03.870 --> 22:05.949
Uh, yeah, honey bear.

22:05.951 --> 22:09.051
Uh, you used the wrong name on the tickets.

22:09.053 --> 22:12.412
That's funny, I thought
Josh Merit was correct.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.660
You two are traveling together?

22:13.662 --> 22:14.684
She does this all the time.

22:14.686 --> 22:16.508
- I... What?
- Uh...

22:16.510 --> 22:18.650
- Josh was my middle name, pumpkin.
- Really?

22:18.652 --> 22:19.706
You don't know your man's middle name?

22:19.708 --> 22:21.626
She means, really?

22:21.628 --> 22:23.578
That makes a difference?

22:23.580 --> 22:26.458
I'm gonna have to ask the
two of you to step aside.

22:26.460 --> 22:28.217
I cannot believe I got talked into this.

22:28.219 --> 22:29.208
What were you thinking?

22:29.210 --> 22:31.225
What were my parents thinking?

22:31.227 --> 22:34.808
- Exactly. Michael is a terrible name.
- Hey, my name's Michael.

22:34.810 --> 22:36.567
Well, don't tell her
that. She'll get all crazy.

22:36.569 --> 22:38.680
I should have gone with any of
the other guys that I looked at.

22:38.682 --> 22:39.863
Well, that's just hurtful.

22:39.865 --> 22:41.046
Even the guy who dealt drugs
would have been better than you!

22:41.048 --> 22:43.063
Ma'am, do you have something
that you would like to declare?

22:43.065 --> 22:45.525
Uh, Pookie-bear, let's not
make the nice man upset.

22:45.527 --> 22:47.958
I just wanted to take
a nice trip to Europe.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.326
- You have ruined everything.
- Oh, sure, this is all my fault.

22:50.328 --> 22:52.310
No matter what I do, no
matter how hard I try,

22:52.312 --> 22:54.228
- nothing goes right!
- Nothing goes right for you?

22:54.230 --> 22:55.925
What about me? I just lost my job!

22:55.927 --> 22:58.515
I just wanted to go to Europe!

22:58.517 --> 22:59.540
I just wanted to help children!

22:59.542 --> 23:01.684
I am gonna die alone!

23:01.686 --> 23:03.219
It's like you don't even know me!

23:03.221 --> 23:04.500
Oh, hell. Uhh!

23:04.502 --> 23:05.779
Go on, it's fine.

23:05.781 --> 23:07.123
Really?

23:07.125 --> 23:08.661
Thank you so much.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.202
Y'all crazy.

23:13.204 --> 23:15.188
We're in therapy.

23:24.658 --> 23:26.674
See? That wasn't so bad.

23:29.458 --> 23:31.311
You were great back there, by the way.

23:31.313 --> 23:33.358
Let's be clear... I'm
not going to let anything

23:33.360 --> 23:35.598
take this trip away from me, okay?

23:35.600 --> 23:37.997
Okay.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.717
Thank you, by the way.

23:40.719 --> 23:42.221
For everything.

23:42.223 --> 23:45.453
You have no idea how badly I needed this.

23:45.455 --> 23:47.724
Well... me, too.

23:47.726 --> 23:50.572
So... thank you.

23:50.574 --> 23:53.611
Uh, before I forget...

23:53.613 --> 23:56.206
this should cover my half of the trip.

23:57.517 --> 23:58.987
It was a great deal, by the way.

23:58.989 --> 24:00.298
You got really lucky.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.930
(scoffs) It wasn't luck.

24:01.932 --> 24:03.881
It took a lot of careful
planning and scheduling.

24:03.883 --> 24:05.066
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

24:05.068 --> 24:06.600
Yes, sir, can I get you anything?

24:06.602 --> 24:08.072
Could I get a scotch
and soda before takeoff?

24:08.074 --> 24:09.032
Of course, sir.

24:09.034 --> 24:10.056
Thanks.

24:10.058 --> 24:13.032
(sighs and clears throat)

24:13.034 --> 24:14.695
What?

24:14.697 --> 24:16.424
It's a little early, isn't it?

24:16.426 --> 24:20.550
Um... I thought we were
going on vacation, right?

24:20.552 --> 24:22.982
And did I mention, free scotch?

24:22.984 --> 24:26.725
See, um, this is really more
of a retreat than a binge.

24:26.727 --> 24:28.645
I'm just having a drink to calm my nerves.

24:28.647 --> 24:30.022
Well, it would really calm my nerves

24:30.024 --> 24:32.069
if I knew I wasn't
traveling with an alcoholic.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.925
What are you, Mormon? It's one drink!

24:33.927 --> 24:36.324
I don't know anything about you.

24:36.326 --> 24:39.269
Like, apparently, I don't even
know your real name, Michael!

24:39.271 --> 24:41.507
Look, no one's called me
Michael since I was seven.

24:41.509 --> 24:43.300
- Uh, Michael?
- What?

24:43.302 --> 24:44.706
Uh, your drink.

24:44.708 --> 24:46.114
Thanks. Sorry.

24:46.116 --> 24:47.587
Enjoy.

24:47.589 --> 24:49.763
Lush.

24:49.765 --> 24:51.361
Actually, you know what, Miss?

24:51.363 --> 24:53.216
- Let's make it a double.
- Sure thing.

24:53.218 --> 24:54.273
Seriously?

24:54.275 --> 24:55.490
When in Rome.

24:55.492 --> 24:57.952
Look... this is just

24:57.954 --> 25:00.385
a really sensitive time for me,

25:00.387 --> 25:01.855
and I need to know you're not a creep.

25:01.857 --> 25:04.256
You approached me on the Internet!

25:04.258 --> 25:05.731
I thought we were way past creepy.

25:07.265 --> 25:09.247
You want your return ticket?

25:09.249 --> 25:11.967
Fine.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.277
When we land,

25:13.279 --> 25:15.869
you can just turn around
and go right back home!

25:15.871 --> 25:17.856
Come on. Seriously?

25:20.958 --> 25:22.588
Fine.

25:22.590 --> 25:24.605
If it will make you uncomfortable,

25:24.607 --> 25:25.790
I won't drink.

25:26.911 --> 25:28.379
Thank you.

25:28.381 --> 25:30.302
Sorry. Mom won't let me.

Okay. Oh, no.

25:41.884 --> 25:43.802

25:44.955 --> 25:45.913

25:45.915 --> 25:47.066
Please stop.

25:47.068 --> 25:48.600
Sorry, I can't.

25:48.602 --> 25:50.201
You're freaking me out, Joshua.

25:50.203 --> 25:51.608
I don't like flying.

You don't like to fly?

25:53.721 --> 25:55.384
I'm scared of flying!

25:55.386 --> 25:56.471
Then why did you agree to fly

25:56.473 --> 25:58.134
halfway across the world with me?

25:58.136 --> 25:59.800
How the hell else was I
supposed to get to Europe?

25:59.802 --> 26:01.303
You never fly?

26:01.305 --> 26:03.286
No, I drink, then I fly!

26:03.288 --> 26:04.661
Then why aren't you drinking now?

26:04.663 --> 26:06.037
You told me not to!

26:06.039 --> 26:07.478
(woman) Sir! Please calm down.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.726
We're in the middle of takeoff!

26:08.728 --> 26:10.677
Sorry! Oh, God, oh, God...

26:10.679 --> 26:12.404
Don't worry, Joshua, I have got this.

26:12.406 --> 26:13.813
No, no, I'm fine.

26:13.815 --> 26:14.773
You are gonna drink this.

26:14.775 --> 26:15.763
No, I'm not.

26:15.765 --> 26:17.651
- Yes, yes.
- Just gonna sit here.

26:17.653 --> 26:19.093
- I can handle it!
- Drink.

26:20.117 --> 26:21.330
Drink it!

26:21.332 --> 26:22.482
Drink... Damn it, drink it!

26:22.484 --> 26:23.442
I don't want it anymore.

26:23.444 --> 26:24.500
- Open your mouth.
- No...

26:24.502 --> 26:25.970
- No, thank you!
- Open your mouth.

26:25.972 --> 26:27.730
Open your mouth!

Gah!

Do you need anything?

You put the room in Josh's name?

27:18.763 --> 27:20.042
No wonder you needed me.

Working in the travel
industry has its perks.

27:22.059 --> 27:24.329
With my brilliant master
plan, I doubled up on discounts

27:24.331 --> 27:25.833
by using two different names.

27:25.835 --> 27:28.360

27:28.362 --> 27:31.208
So, in your grand master
plan, how did this work out?

27:31.210 --> 27:32.327
Well...

27:32.329 --> 27:34.471
the couch looks perfectly comfortable,

27:34.473 --> 27:36.903
and as long as you don't take
your penis out, we should be fine.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.247
Whoa, that's not fair.

27:38.249 --> 27:39.750
I mean, I paid my half of the trip,

27:39.752 --> 27:41.736
and after all, the room is in my name.

27:42.726 --> 27:43.750
How's unemployment in
California this time of year?

27:43.752 --> 27:44.966
I can't believe you're single.

27:44.968 --> 27:46.661
Just try not to vomit on anything.

27:46.663 --> 27:48.550
Okay, sure. I'll take a shower.

27:48.552 --> 27:50.404
I smell like scotch and bad life choices.

27:50.406 --> 27:51.716
So it does know how to bathe.

27:51.718 --> 27:53.764
I thought the priority
was surname, not hygiene.

- Would both kill you?

27:55.045 --> 27:56.324
A couple days of this might.

27:56.326 --> 27:58.115
Don't bother unpacking,

27:58.117 --> 27:59.908
we're leaving first thing in the morning.

27:59.910 --> 28:02.659
And hurry up, we have a tour
of the Hagia Sophia in an hour.

28:02.661 --> 28:04.003
We just got here.

28:04.005 --> 28:05.666
I don't think the museum is going anywhere.

28:05.668 --> 28:07.234

sink next to the toilet!

Joshua, or as it turns out, Michael Joshua,

28:27.361 --> 28:29.119
just hopped in the shower,
so I thought I'd get on.

28:29.121 --> 28:32.095
If I were you, I'd hop in
there with him and get off.

28:32.097 --> 28:33.598
Ew. Where's Marcie?

28:33.600 --> 28:35.741
Yo, Enforcer! Let's park it in here.

28:35.743 --> 28:36.861
Ames is on.

28:36.863 --> 28:38.684
Ugh, don't rush me woman.

28:38.686 --> 28:40.413
I've been peddling all day.

28:40.415 --> 28:42.525
I just wanted to check in
with you guys and let you know

28:42.527 --> 28:43.933
that we got to Istanbul safely.

28:43.935 --> 28:45.211
(Sandra) Don't you mean Constantinople?

28:45.213 --> 28:47.228
- Funny.
- How's homeboy holding up?

28:47.230 --> 28:49.019
After take-off, he was fine.

28:49.021 --> 28:50.396
Oh, you put him in line.

28:50.398 --> 28:53.691
I think his fear of flying
did all the work for me.

28:53.693 --> 28:55.515
Wait, who takes on a tour of Europe

28:55.517 --> 28:56.666
when they're afraid to fly?

28:56.668 --> 28:58.330
He's harmless.

28:58.332 --> 29:00.474
A total smartass, but
he'll get the job done.

29:00.476 --> 29:02.553
See, aren't you glad you went now?

29:02.555 --> 29:05.208
I am. You should see the view.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.713
It's gorgeous here.

We're having dinner
tonight on the Bosporus,

- Move where?
- To the right!

much cooler places than I do.

34:08.650 --> 34:10.472
Well, hypothetically,

34:10.474 --> 34:11.719

34:11.721 --> 34:13.351

Okay, yeah. Austin is not Istanbul.

34:15.274 --> 34:16.774
They have teaching conferences in Istanbul.

34:16.775 --> 34:19.270
Let's stick to hypothetical Austin for now.

34:19.272 --> 34:20.358
Great.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.510
Having never been to Texas,

34:21.512 --> 34:23.141
you decide to stay an extra day,

34:23.143 --> 34:25.349
so you can see more than
the inside of a hotel room.

34:25.351 --> 34:28.132
Trip's already paid for. You
have the sick days saved up.

34:28.135 --> 34:30.821
And for a small fee, I can unlock the city

34:30.822 --> 34:32.675
so that you see more in 24 hours

34:32.677 --> 34:34.820
than most tourists or
locals see in a month,

34:34.822 --> 34:36.547
all tailored to your tastes.

34:36.550 --> 34:38.692
I'm pretty sure I'd still
find some cool stuff.

34:38.694 --> 34:40.038
We're here.

Come, come!

34:50.020 --> 34:51.105
Where do you find these places?

34:51.107 --> 34:52.097
Instagram.

34:53.763 --> 34:55.775
You're not joking...

34:55.777 --> 34:57.984
I'm finishing the first batch of the day.

34:57.986 --> 34:59.233
You wanna see?

34:59.235 --> 35:00.355
Yes, please.

35:03.809 --> 35:06.270
Perfect!

35:06.272 --> 35:07.486

So...

35:33.500 --> 35:35.739
Instagram, huh?

35:35.741 --> 35:38.138
I can search the hashtag,
"Istanbul Bakery."

35:38.140 --> 35:40.185
Sort through photos that
are often geo-tagged,

35:40.187 --> 35:41.689
find directions to the actual bakery,

35:41.691 --> 35:43.097
and <i>voila!</i>

35:43.099 --> 35:44.985
A local delicacy made fresh.

35:44.987 --> 35:46.648
You came up with all this?

35:46.650 --> 35:48.343
Just the impressive part.

35:48.345 --> 35:50.488
Why is it people like you
always work for smart start-ups

35:50.490 --> 35:53.495
instead of solving the
debt crisis or world hunger?

35:53.497 --> 35:56.762

I'm wasting my talents.

Our life was.

other people instead of myself.

43:24.176 --> 43:26.734
I know this trip isn't what you planned.

43:26.736 --> 43:28.622
Hell, I'm the last
person who expected to be

43:28.624 --> 43:30.446
on the other side of the world right now.

43:30.448 --> 43:33.420
But it sure beats sitting
at home sulking over my job,

43:33.422 --> 43:35.340
my love life...

43:35.342 --> 43:38.220
everything else that's waiting
for me when I get back there.

43:38.222 --> 43:40.811
You don't wanna go back home, either?

43:40.813 --> 43:41.837
Hell, no.

43:41.839 --> 43:43.692
I, for one, will never be able

43:43.694 --> 43:45.259
to afford a trip like this again.

43:45.261 --> 43:46.699
Unless some weirdo on
the Internet finds me.

43:46.701 --> 43:48.363
It's not that weird!

43:48.365 --> 43:51.118
It's the weirdest thing
that's ever happened to me.

43:53.101 --> 43:54.377
Here.

43:54.379 --> 43:56.138
What is that?

43:56.140 --> 43:58.442
Literally an olive branch.

43:58.444 --> 43:59.977
You're a dork.

43:59.979 --> 44:00.971
You picked me.

44:03.721 --> 44:04.777
Come on.

44:04.779 --> 44:05.770
Hey!

44:10.922 --> 44:13.416
Amy, tell the people at home what you see.

44:13.418 --> 44:14.599
Stop.

44:14.601 --> 44:16.166
This week on "Amy's Adventures,"

44:16.168 --> 44:18.054
we take you to Bademli,

44:18.056 --> 44:19.558
a small town which translates to "almond,"

44:19.560 --> 44:21.797
which is actually known
for its Aegean olive fields

44:21.799 --> 44:23.109
that we spent the morning whizzing through.

44:23.111 --> 44:25.669
- How do you know that?
- I'm a very smart man.

44:25.671 --> 44:27.589
You found the tourism office.

44:27.591 --> 44:29.060
I may have found the tourism office,

44:29.062 --> 44:30.532
but I think that was a very smart way

44:30.534 --> 44:32.644
to find all the coffee places in town.

44:32.646 --> 44:35.526
The other thing Bademli is known for is...

44:36.806 --> 44:38.755
(crowd chattering)

44:38.757 --> 44:40.355
(Joshua speaking Turkish)

44:40.357 --> 44:41.313

Uh, it's a, uh, bracelet
made with blue chalcedony,

44:49.763 --> 44:52.480
which is a local quartz
with... mythical powers.

44:52.482 --> 44:53.665
What does it do?

44:53.667 --> 44:55.393
Absorbs negativity.

44:55.395 --> 44:56.480
Is it working?

44:56.482 --> 44:57.599
Jerk.

44:57.601 --> 44:58.560
Pick one.

44:58.562 --> 44:59.806
No, I couldn't.

44:59.808 --> 45:02.081
Come on, you're insulting Neslihan.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.008

45:10.272 --> 45:11.745
- Help?
- Ah.

45:15.998 --> 45:17.980
Why are you being so nice to me?

45:17.982 --> 45:20.701
I'm only a jerk to people
who take me to Hawaii.

45:20.703 --> 45:22.716
No one's ever bought me jewelry before.

45:22.718 --> 45:27.194
Well, your ex's shortcomings
aside, now you can tell people

45:27.196 --> 45:28.506
about how you and a complete stranger

45:28.508 --> 45:30.330
found this adorable little market,

45:30.332 --> 45:32.857
and he bought you a
one-of-a-kind handmade bracelet.

45:32.859 --> 45:35.065
You think you can just buy me a bracelet

45:35.067 --> 45:36.154
and I won't be upset anymore?

45:36.156 --> 45:38.136
Is it working?

45:38.138 --> 45:42.104
Listen, Amy, this trip is not
gonna be what you expected.

45:42.106 --> 45:44.984
But I'll bet, if you let it...

45:44.986 --> 45:46.714
it can be even better.

45:49.178 --> 45:50.552

How can we ever repay you?

49:07.896 --> 49:09.878
Why, a kiss, of course.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.287
Oh...

That's really more of a figure of speech.

Kashif, is there a place where we could

49:32.341 --> 49:33.810
get out of these wet clothes?

What man can deny such an honor?

Please.

49:47.666 --> 49:49.713
Who says I wasn't jumping
to get away from her?

49:49.715 --> 49:53.007
Listen, if a woman makes you
want to jump in the ocean,

49:53.009 --> 49:54.192
you're in love.

49:54.194 --> 49:55.952

49:55.954 --> 49:57.359
Where were you headed?

49:57.361 --> 49:59.056
To Datça.

You have good taste.

Again, you have good taste.

50:03.728 --> 50:05.423
Wait...

50:05.425 --> 50:06.734
You have a boat.

50:06.736 --> 50:08.270
You could take us there.

50:08.272 --> 50:09.486
It's not my yacht.

50:09.488 --> 50:11.245
I chartered it for the owner.

50:11.247 --> 50:12.781
And, no offense,

I don't think you can afford it.

54:47.875 --> 54:50.144
Ugh! Rendering.

54:50.146 --> 54:51.715
(phone alert)

54:58.401 --> 55:00.510
(phone line ringing)

55:00.512 --> 55:02.047
Girl, I'm at work.

55:02.049 --> 55:03.905
Yeah, we have a problem.

55:12.254 --> 55:14.748
What do you think you're doing?

55:14.750 --> 55:17.787
No. You can't possibly expect me

55:17.789 --> 55:19.771
to sleep on the floor after last night.

55:19.773 --> 55:21.756
There was nowhere else
to sleep on the yacht.

55:21.758 --> 55:24.186
I just took pity on you. Whoa.

55:24.188 --> 55:28.283
If that was pity, I can't
wait to see interested.

55:28.285 --> 55:31.928
Watch it, or I won't even
let you have the good pillows.

55:31.930 --> 55:33.786
You know what?

55:33.788 --> 55:37.624
Maybe I'll take the bed and
you can sleep on the floor!

55:37.626 --> 55:39.353
Get down from there!
You're covered in filth!

55:39.355 --> 55:40.665
You smell like a pirate!

55:40.667 --> 55:43.512
Arr! That didn't stop you
from grabbing me booty.

55:43.514 --> 55:46.168
Go take a shower! Okay.

55:46.170 --> 55:48.407
But I'm taking the good pillows with me.

55:48.409 --> 55:51.222
This one and this one.

55:51.224 --> 55:53.431
Hurry up. We have a walking
tour in less than an hour!

55:53.433 --> 55:56.249
Of course we do.

56:04.022 --> 56:05.588
(line ringing)

56:05.590 --> 56:07.923
Joshua, that's how you get bed bugs.

56:07.925 --> 56:09.590
Aw, crap.

56:14.261 --> 56:17.077
(line ringing)

56:38.128 --> 56:40.270
(call chimes)

56:40.272 --> 56:42.383
We've been trying to get
a hold of you all weekend!

56:42.385 --> 56:43.663
Is Joshua there?

56:43.665 --> 56:44.910
He's in the shower.

56:44.912 --> 56:47.214
Oh, my God, he has an engagement ring.

56:47.216 --> 56:49.453
I mean, he doesn't know
that I know he has a ring.

56:49.455 --> 56:50.573
Why does he have a ring?

56:50.575 --> 56:51.372
Amy, calm down.

56:51.374 --> 56:52.173
It's beautiful. It's a little snug.

56:52.175 --> 56:54.605
- But I hardly know him!
- Amy, please!

56:54.607 --> 56:57.228
He pushes all my buttons, makes
me feel like a crazy person.

56:57.230 --> 56:58.508
But then on the boat, we kissed.

56:58.510 --> 57:00.364
And then we more than kissed.

57:00.366 --> 57:01.580
And now we're in the Mediterranean

57:01.582 --> 57:02.890
and he has this ring!

57:02.892 --> 57:03.947
Amy! Amy!

57:03.949 --> 57:05.450
He has a girlfriend!

57:05.452 --> 57:07.434
What?

57:07.436 --> 57:11.145
That punk is a lying,
cheating, scum-sucking pig!

57:11.147 --> 57:12.586
You should confront him!

57:12.588 --> 57:14.057
How could he have a girlfriend?

57:14.059 --> 57:16.680
We researched him. You
did a background check.

57:16.682 --> 57:17.896
Just tell her.

57:17.898 --> 57:19.784
There's tons of pictures online

57:19.786 --> 57:23.623
of him and some really young
pretty blonde named Tiffany.

57:23.625 --> 57:24.999
What does she need that description for?

57:25.001 --> 57:26.088
This isn't a police report.

57:26.090 --> 57:27.975
I'm so sorry, Ames!

57:27.977 --> 57:31.015
There's photo albums dating
back to four years ago with them.

57:31.017 --> 57:33.285
Vacations, anniversaries.

57:33.287 --> 57:34.694
Maybe they broke up.

57:34.696 --> 57:35.941
Yesterday, she wrote on his wall,

57:35.943 --> 57:37.446
"Where are you?

57:37.448 --> 57:39.045
I'm ready to give you my answer."

57:39.047 --> 57:42.212
And now I'm wearing her ring.

57:42.214 --> 57:43.716
You did nothing wrong, Ames.

57:43.718 --> 57:45.252
There's no relationship
status on his profile.

57:45.254 --> 57:46.500
How could you have known?

57:46.502 --> 57:47.684
But we had to tell you.

57:47.686 --> 57:48.964
Guys?

57:48.966 --> 57:50.276
Is there anything we can do?

57:50.278 --> 57:52.035
Get this ring off me?

57:52.037 --> 57:53.955
Just take it off!

57:53.957 --> 57:54.914
I can't, it's stuck.

57:54.916 --> 57:56.258
Well, it better get unstuck.

57:56.260 --> 57:57.794
Amy, you can't be caught
wearing that thing!

57:57.796 --> 57:58.979
I know that!

57:58.981 --> 58:00.834
It's like it's glued to my finger.

58:00.836 --> 58:02.658
That Tiffany must be some
kind of anorexic bitch.

58:02.660 --> 58:04.289
- Pull it!
- Not helping.

58:04.291 --> 58:05.633
- Just twist, okay, twist.
- Just pull it!

58:05.635 --> 58:06.752
Do you have butter? Just get the butter.

58:06.754 --> 58:07.713
Where would she get butter?

58:07.715 --> 58:08.612
I don't know. Oil!

58:10.209 --> 58:12.415
Oh, my God. Amy, he's coming!

58:12.417 --> 58:13.537
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I'm freaking.

58:18.912 --> 58:19.969
Put it back now.

58:25.919 --> 58:28.605
You okay? You're doing the pee-pee dance

58:28.607 --> 58:29.885
my students used to do.

58:29.887 --> 58:34.588
Well, that is exactly correct.

58:34.590 --> 58:36.925
Somebody took forever in the shower

58:36.927 --> 58:38.427
and you better not have
used up all the hot water

58:38.429 --> 58:40.187
because now I'm gonna take one, too.

58:40.189 --> 58:42.363
And I need soap. Lots of soap!

58:42.365 --> 58:46.073
Good! Who smells like a pirate now?

58:46.075 --> 58:48.605
Oh. Hello, ladies.

58:50.747 --> 58:52.505
Hurry it up in there!

58:52.507 --> 58:54.459
The ruins might not be
there if we take too long.

59:06.841 --> 59:11.062
(tour guide) The City of Ephesus is
known for housing the Temple of Artemis,

59:11.064 --> 59:14.517
one of the Seven Wonders
of the Ancient World.

59:14.519 --> 59:19.127
Right now, we are in front of
the magnificent Library of Celsus.

59:21.622 --> 59:22.581
What are you doing?

59:22.583 --> 59:24.467
What are you doing?

59:24.469 --> 59:26.995
...known to store 12,000 scrolls.

59:26.997 --> 59:29.426
Ow! What was that for? Shh!

59:29.428 --> 59:31.699
You're missing all the... knowledge.

59:31.701 --> 59:33.106
What's on your hand? Nothing.

59:33.108 --> 59:35.826
Let me see. No. Uh, uh, mm...

59:35.828 --> 59:37.778
Really?

59:37.780 --> 59:39.924
Uh, Tiberius Julius Aquila...

59:41.427 --> 59:43.216
No! It's not that big a deal!

59:43.218 --> 59:44.176
Don't! Just let...

59:44.178 --> 59:45.616
I don't like it!

59:45.618 --> 59:47.472
See what you made me do?

59:47.474 --> 59:49.903
Listen to the guide!

59:49.905 --> 59:52.176
Now we're going to move on to the Agora.

59:52.178 --> 59:56.718
Oh, no! Oh, no!

59:56.720 --> 59:59.665
Oh... Yes!

01:00:01.456 --> 01:00:03.854
(tour guide) This was
built by the Antonine family

01:00:03.856 --> 01:00:08.653
during the reign of Marcus
Aurelius around 160 A.D.

01:00:08.655 --> 01:00:10.191
(groaning)

01:00:12.174 --> 01:00:17.899
Oh! Oh, God. Oh! Uhh!

01:00:17.901 --> 01:00:21.611
(tour guide) Unfortunately,
the water is not drinkable

01:00:21.613 --> 01:00:23.790
because the Romans were
known to use lead pipes.

01:00:26.859 --> 01:00:28.237
Thirsty?

01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:36.328
Beautiful stonework. So old.

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:38.282
Moving on.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.596
What's really going on?

01:00:58.598 --> 01:01:00.580
It really is beautiful, isn't it?

01:01:00.582 --> 01:01:04.485
It's all right. I'm more of an Obelisk guy.

01:01:04.487 --> 01:01:08.324
I mean, fountains are cool, too.

01:01:08.326 --> 01:01:11.715
I've dreamt about this
fountain for two years.

01:01:11.717 --> 01:01:13.539
I made it my screensaver.

01:01:13.541 --> 01:01:16.770
I scrapbooked. I left my

01:01:16.772 --> 01:01:18.434
jewelry on a dresser every night

01:01:18.436 --> 01:01:22.113
so that he could get my
ring size without asking.

01:01:22.115 --> 01:01:24.161
God, I'm an idiot.

01:01:24.163 --> 01:01:26.112
No, that was actually really smart.

01:01:26.114 --> 01:01:30.752
I worked so hard and I
sacrificed so much and now

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:35.647
I'm standing here alone with nothing.

01:01:35.649 --> 01:01:37.534
No one is ever gonna propose to me

01:01:37.536 --> 01:01:39.873
in front of this stupid fountain.

01:01:45.215 --> 01:01:48.032
Well, maybe Josh won't.

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:51.356
But I can.

01:01:51.358 --> 01:01:54.045
Look, Amy, I know this is crazy,

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:55.357
but you have a dream to be proposed to

01:01:55.359 --> 01:01:57.946
in front of this fountain
and I have a ring.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:00.507
How perfect is that? Joshua.

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:03.034
This has been the most
amazing week of my entire life.

01:02:03.036 --> 01:02:04.665
And I know you feel it, too.

01:02:04.667 --> 01:02:05.786
Please don't do this.

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.705
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

01:02:07.707 --> 01:02:11.964
Amy Elizabeth Tyler, let's do this.

01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:20.087
Ah, crap! No! No, no! Where is it?

01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:22.619
No! You mean this?

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.431
Why do you have my ring?

01:02:25.433 --> 01:02:27.351
Don't you mean Tiffany's ring?

01:02:27.353 --> 01:02:29.303
Okay, that's fair. I can explain.

01:02:29.305 --> 01:02:31.381
Explain what? That you have a girlfriend?

01:02:31.383 --> 01:02:33.430
That you have an
engagement ring in your bag?

01:02:33.432 --> 01:02:35.029
That you slept with me and lied to me?

01:02:35.031 --> 01:02:37.365
Whoa, I never lied to you.

01:02:37.367 --> 01:02:39.444
You never told me. That's the same thing!

01:02:39.446 --> 01:02:41.140
You never asked! All you cared about

01:02:41.142 --> 01:02:43.219
was that my name was Josh
Merit and I had a passport.

01:02:43.221 --> 01:02:44.309
You didn't even know I spoke Turkish!

01:02:44.311 --> 01:02:46.803
This is a little different.

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:48.658
We both wanted an escape from our lives

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.938
and we didn't ask questions.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.434
I lost everything in a matter of weeks.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:55.537
My world was spiraling out
of control, so I panicked.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:58.705
I proposed. And I lost
the one thing I had left.

01:02:58.707 --> 01:03:01.938
Lost her how? She wrote
on your wall yesterday.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.057
What are you talking about?

01:03:03.059 --> 01:03:05.265
Tiffany said she needed time and space.

01:03:05.267 --> 01:03:07.855
We lived together! What
does that even mean?

01:03:07.857 --> 01:03:11.440
The next day I got an e-mail
offering me a two week vacation.

01:03:11.442 --> 01:03:13.744
I couldn't be there, so I
packed a bag and came here.

01:03:13.746 --> 01:03:16.431
And jumped into bed with
the first available girl.

01:03:16.433 --> 01:03:18.255
Oh, please. I didn't
expect to sleep with you.

01:03:18.257 --> 01:03:19.822
On the first day, I
didn't expect to like you.

01:03:19.824 --> 01:03:22.573
So, a week later, you propose to me?

01:03:22.575 --> 01:03:25.036
You can't just decide things, Joshua.

01:03:25.038 --> 01:03:27.309
Feelings aren't something you decide, Amy.

01:03:27.311 --> 01:03:29.837
Or plan. Or make up.

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.596
You were crying. I had a ring.

01:03:31.598 --> 01:03:32.972
What do you expect me to do?

01:03:32.974 --> 01:03:35.180
I expect you to tell me
you have a girlfriend!

01:03:35.182 --> 01:03:36.650
Well, I expect you to tell me

01:03:36.652 --> 01:03:38.570
that you took a $3,000 ring from my bag.

01:03:38.572 --> 01:03:41.290
I don't want your ring. I want an apology!

01:03:41.292 --> 01:03:43.499
Okay, I'm sorry! Now, give it back.

01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:46.153
It's stuck. You think I want
this piece of crap on me?

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.593
Did you try soap and water?

01:03:47.595 --> 01:03:49.385
Why do you think I was
in the shower for so long?

01:03:49.387 --> 01:03:50.409
Because you're a girl!

01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:52.009
So what do we do now?

01:03:52.011 --> 01:03:54.025
I don't know! You're always
the one with the plan!

01:03:54.027 --> 01:03:55.752
Well, you're the one who's
so good at improvising.

01:03:55.754 --> 01:03:57.482
So, improvise!

01:04:04.937 --> 01:04:07.366
Hold still, you'll hurt the ring.

01:04:07.368 --> 01:04:09.126
Thank you for your concern.

01:04:09.128 --> 01:04:11.942
About 1.2 carats. Nice cut.

01:04:11.944 --> 01:04:13.989
What kind of grade is the stone? F?

01:04:13.991 --> 01:04:15.014
It's E, actually.

01:04:15.016 --> 01:04:16.420
Can we back to... Ow.

01:04:16.422 --> 01:04:18.788
The ring is too tight
to be removed by hand.

01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:21.189
I think the lack of circulation is making

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.565
her finger swell too much.

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.067
- Then we'll cut it off.
- My finger?

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:25.667
Should fix the circulation problem.

01:04:25.669 --> 01:04:28.612
You want me to saw through the band?

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:29.667
Yes. No.

01:04:29.669 --> 01:04:31.298
Easy there,

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.185
- jigsaw killer.
- It's the only way

01:04:33.187 --> 01:04:34.498
to cut the platinum and save the setting.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.449
Oh, platinum. Fancy.

01:04:36.451 --> 01:04:38.145
Can't we just wait and see
if her finger falls off?

01:04:38.147 --> 01:04:39.778
Why are you two even engaged?

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:40.961
- We're not. - We're not.
- (speaking Turkish)

01:04:40.963 --> 01:04:42.336
(speaking Turkish)

01:04:42.338 --> 01:04:45.443
It's your ring. It's your problem.

01:04:47.618 --> 01:04:50.434
(door opens and closes)

01:04:52.002 --> 01:04:54.814
All right, hold still. This
will only take a minute.

01:04:54.816 --> 01:04:56.351
Like your decision to marry me?

01:04:56.353 --> 01:04:58.210
You're still wearing the ring.

01:05:02.239 --> 01:05:05.055
(whirring)

01:05:15.517 --> 01:05:17.308
There we go.

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:20.122
First side, now the other. See?

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:21.371
Nothing to worry about.

01:05:21.373 --> 01:05:23.353
Nothing to worry about?

01:05:23.355 --> 01:05:25.370
Everything's a mess, Joshua.

01:05:25.372 --> 01:05:28.186
Well, sometimes life gets messy, Amy.

01:05:28.188 --> 01:05:30.169
It doesn't follow your perfect little plan

01:05:30.171 --> 01:05:31.609
and you have to just go with it.

01:05:31.611 --> 01:05:32.985
Well, that's convenient,
coming from the guy

01:05:32.987 --> 01:05:34.104
who put me in this situation.

01:05:34.106 --> 01:05:36.408
You put us here, Amy.

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:38.327
You know, that's your problem.

01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:41.911
This whole trip... Your plan, Amy. Yours.

01:05:41.913 --> 01:05:43.223
None of this is what I planned.

01:05:43.225 --> 01:05:45.081
Yeah? Me neither.

01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:49.366
The funny part about being
spontaneous is it means

01:05:49.368 --> 01:05:51.126
you actually have to
commit to your decisions.

01:05:51.128 --> 01:05:54.261
Why don't we ask Tiffany
about your commitment?

01:05:54.263 --> 01:05:57.620
You know, you just rejected me and now

01:05:57.622 --> 01:05:59.667
I'm destroying the most
valuable thing I own,

01:05:59.669 --> 01:06:02.419
because you're right. That's what I do.

01:06:02.421 --> 01:06:04.404
I drop everything to help you.

01:06:04.406 --> 01:06:06.323
Help my students. Help my dog.

01:06:06.325 --> 01:06:08.499
- How'd that work out for you?
- Wow.

01:06:08.501 --> 01:06:10.965
I work with kids and you're the
most selfish person I've ever met.

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.577
You still have your return ticket?

01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:24.464
Unless you took it out of my bag.

01:06:24.466 --> 01:06:26.384
Then I suggest you go home.

01:06:26.386 --> 01:06:29.138
I never should've left.

01:06:41.136 --> 01:06:42.893
(speaking Turkish)

01:06:42.895 --> 01:06:44.910
I need to exchange this
ticket for the next flight.

01:06:44.912 --> 01:06:48.492
Okay. You'll fly standby.

01:06:48.494 --> 01:06:50.316
It's gate 23 over there.

01:06:50.318 --> 01:06:52.588
- What do I do with this one?
- Nothing.

01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:54.191
Useless now.

01:07:24.393 --> 01:07:28.169
(muted audio on video)

01:07:37.414 --> 01:07:40.583
Hey, Tiffany. Can I come in?

01:07:51.268 --> 01:07:53.089
It's very lovely.

01:07:53.091 --> 01:07:54.339
Excuse me?

01:07:54.341 --> 01:07:55.585
Your bracelet.

01:07:55.587 --> 01:07:58.722
Oh. Thank you.

01:07:58.724 --> 01:08:00.097
Boyfriend?

01:08:00.099 --> 01:08:04.224
No. From a stranger, actually.

01:08:04.226 --> 01:08:06.817
Strangers can sometimes be
more important than we know.

01:08:06.819 --> 01:08:10.079
Not this one. He's unpredictable.

01:08:10.081 --> 01:08:12.959
And unreliable.

01:08:12.961 --> 01:08:15.039
I organized the perfect vacation

01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:17.054
and he couldn't just
relax and enjoy the plan.

01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:21.598
I understand. My life started with a plan.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.725
I was introduced to a boy named
Manish when I was six years old.

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.964
We were to be married when he was 18.

01:08:27.966 --> 01:08:30.845
We were both so young and so scared.

01:08:30.846 --> 01:08:33.723
We had nothing in common.

01:08:33.725 --> 01:08:38.075
On our wedding day, we have
a ceremony called Shaka Paula

01:08:38.077 --> 01:08:40.379
where the groom gives the bride

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:45.593
a symbol of a long and lasting marriage.

01:08:45.595 --> 01:08:48.952
- A bracelet.
- He was just a stranger.

01:08:48.953 --> 01:08:52.377
And with a bracelet, he
became my best friend.

01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:54.774
Don't the differences make you crazy?

01:08:54.777 --> 01:08:58.520
Why would I want to be married to myself?

01:08:58.522 --> 01:09:02.327
With Manish, every day is an adventure.

01:09:02.328 --> 01:09:04.247
I'm jealous.

01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:06.294
You have the security
of knowing your future.

01:09:06.296 --> 01:09:09.174
Nobody knows their future.

01:09:09.176 --> 01:09:12.791
I just knew who I wanted to spend it with.

01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:19.796
I can't believe this.

01:09:19.798 --> 01:09:22.004
You've gotta be kidding me. So, you, like,

01:09:22.006 --> 01:09:25.044
just went to Europe for two
weeks without telling me?

01:09:25.046 --> 01:09:26.803
You said you needed time
and space to think about it.

01:09:26.805 --> 01:09:29.075
Not with another woman!

01:09:29.077 --> 01:09:30.162
You have every right to be upset.

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:31.858
Thank you for your permission.

01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:34.066
Hey, I mean, you clearly
found someone else, too.

01:09:34.068 --> 01:09:35.506
Can I go?

01:09:35.508 --> 01:09:37.298
Will you leave him out of this?

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.897
I just wanted to do the right thing

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:42.416
and let you know that I
realized we're not in love.

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:45.582
Of course we're not,
Joshua. We're comfortable.

01:09:45.585 --> 01:09:47.215
I'm not comfortable.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.264
Wait, but I proposed.

01:09:49.265 --> 01:09:50.511
Well, I didn't say, "Yes."

01:09:50.513 --> 01:09:51.791
Well, you didn't say, "No."

01:09:51.792 --> 01:09:53.104
Well, I didn't wanna hurt you.

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.670
That's actually really sweet.

01:09:54.672 --> 01:09:55.789
Hey, thank you.

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.839
Will you just stay out of it, man?

01:09:57.841 --> 01:10:00.078
Look, I still cared about you, dude.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.214
You lost your dog. And
then your job. That sucked.

01:10:03.216 --> 01:10:06.541
But you're always doing crazy
stuff and changing your mind.

01:10:06.543 --> 01:10:12.012
And I didn't wanna be a jerk.
But I didn't wanna marry you.

01:10:12.014 --> 01:10:14.156
And I just figured if
I gave you enough time,

01:10:14.158 --> 01:10:16.652
maybe you'd figure it out.

01:10:16.654 --> 01:10:19.275
I'm sorry.

01:10:19.277 --> 01:10:21.035
Well what was your plan if
you weren't gonna marry me?

01:10:21.037 --> 01:10:25.513
There was no plan. We were just having fun.

01:10:25.515 --> 01:10:26.665
And then we changed.

01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:29.418
We didn't change, we drifted.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.169
You grew up. But I don't want to.

01:10:32.171 --> 01:10:35.367
I still wanna be young and fun and crazy.

01:10:35.369 --> 01:10:37.191
Maybe I'll go to grad school.

01:10:37.193 --> 01:10:39.112
Maybe I'll go to Europe with strangers.

01:10:39.114 --> 01:10:41.127
- You wanna go to Europe?
- Shh.

01:10:41.129 --> 01:10:43.111
Strangers.

01:10:43.113 --> 01:10:44.775
I just can't be locked into a plan.

01:10:44.777 --> 01:10:46.695
Maybe a plan is a good thing.

01:10:46.697 --> 01:10:49.541
Wow. Who's this Joshua?

01:10:49.543 --> 01:10:51.493
You must have had one hell of a vacation.

01:10:51.495 --> 01:10:53.732
Yeah, well, it's over now.

01:10:53.734 --> 01:10:57.252
It came to an end.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.982
Doesn't have to.

01:11:00.134 --> 01:11:02.119
Oh, my God.

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:07.268
You're right!

01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:09.155
Wait, where are you going?

01:11:09.157 --> 01:11:10.530
I have a plane to catch.

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.003
- Wait, can I have the ring?
- No.

01:11:12.005 --> 01:11:13.761
Why would I... What?

01:11:13.763 --> 01:11:15.745
(sighing)

01:11:15.747 --> 01:11:17.444
Do you do laundry?

01:11:19.363 --> 01:11:22.179

Today on "What's Trending,"
we have a Viner named Joshua

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:01.594
posting pictures and video
of himself jumping into water

01:12:01.596 --> 01:12:06.170
around the world, heartbroken
over a travel vlogger named Amy.

01:12:06.172 --> 01:12:07.674
On all of Josh's video love letters,

01:12:07.676 --> 01:12:09.913
he writes the message, hashtag,

01:12:09.915 --> 01:12:12.121
"You Make Me Wanna Jump Into The Ocean."

01:12:12.123 --> 01:12:13.529
Some top comments.

01:12:13.531 --> 01:12:16.699
This from @SupervisorSam who says...

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:21.498
And @Julia93 writes...

01:12:24.952 --> 01:12:27.413
Now, I don't wanna jump to any conclusions,

01:12:27.415 --> 01:12:30.134
but it seems like Joshua is going viral.

01:12:30.136 --> 01:12:31.414
Some words of advice though.

01:12:31.416 --> 01:12:33.976
Better soak it up while you can, Joshua.

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:38.037
I mean, hemp milk is the new coconut milk.

01:12:38.039 --> 01:12:41.589
- Hey, Sandra, did you see the jumper?
- Person or sweater?

01:12:41.591 --> 01:12:43.251
No, this guy is jumping in bodies of water

01:12:43.253 --> 01:12:44.852
all over the world, professing his love

01:12:44.854 --> 01:12:46.706
for this travel vlogger named Amy.

01:12:46.708 --> 01:12:48.627
My Amy? Who knows?

01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:50.610
But he's got over 4
million followers on Vine.

01:12:50.612 --> 01:12:51.826
Holy sh...

01:12:51.828 --> 01:12:55.409
(line ringing)

01:12:55.411 --> 01:12:56.529
(call chimes)

01:12:56.531 --> 01:12:58.928
Hi! So, remember how we're best friends

01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:01.008
and I let you crash on my
couch and I would do anything

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.801
for you and you would do anything for me?

01:13:02.803 --> 01:13:04.080
What do you want?

01:13:04.082 --> 01:13:05.584
Have you seen YouTube?

01:13:05.586 --> 01:13:06.768
In general?

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:08.784
Girl you're famous.

01:13:08.786 --> 01:13:11.503
- Oh, no, what did you do?
- No, it's Joshua.

01:13:11.505 --> 01:13:13.870
He's trying to look for
you and it's going viral!

01:13:13.872 --> 01:13:16.366
He's all over Tumblr.
There's a meme of you.

01:13:16.368 --> 01:13:19.085
It's like this parody song.

01:13:19.087 --> 01:13:20.365
You should just see it.

01:13:20.367 --> 01:13:22.605
Wait, how did I become a meme?

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:24.204
Nobody knows how it works.

01:13:24.206 --> 01:13:26.348
Look, I just need to book
you on my show, today.

01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:29.739
- Wait, what?
- Did you miss the part where you're Internet famous?

01:13:29.741 --> 01:13:32.684
"Amy's Adventures" is getting
millions of views out of this!

01:13:32.686 --> 01:13:34.508
Well, what am I supposed
to talk about on your show?

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:37.483
I don't care! Look, Joshua is running

01:13:37.485 --> 01:13:38.602
all over the world, drowning himself.

01:13:38.604 --> 01:13:39.818
I need to cover this story

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.346
and my best friend is the exclusive.

01:13:42.348 --> 01:13:46.408
Look you know I would be there
for you as a friend, but...

01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:48.010
Do you need to make a pro and con list?

01:13:48.012 --> 01:13:50.217
No, it's just...

01:13:50.219 --> 01:13:52.808
I've spent the last three months
trying to forget about Joshua.

01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:54.120
Well, do you think you could remember him

01:13:54.122 --> 01:13:55.592
in the next three minutes?

01:13:55.594 --> 01:13:57.096
Three minutes? You can't
give me more than that?

01:13:57.098 --> 01:13:58.695
It's the Internet, Amy.

01:13:58.697 --> 01:14:00.806
15 seconds of fame
literally means 15 seconds.

01:14:00.808 --> 01:14:01.862
Come on, please?

01:14:01.864 --> 01:14:05.574
I'll let you promote Spontaneous.

01:14:05.576 --> 01:14:08.134
What's up, Percolators?
Today's "Expresso Yourself"

01:14:08.136 --> 01:14:10.053
is served up live and exclusive.

01:14:10.055 --> 01:14:12.261
My guest proves what
any electrical engineer

01:14:12.263 --> 01:14:15.141
could've told us... to break
the Internet, just add water.

01:14:15.143 --> 01:14:16.900
So, Amy, let's dive in.

01:14:16.902 --> 01:14:19.684
Tell the people why this Joshua person

01:14:19.686 --> 01:14:21.732
is traveling around the
world, looking for you.

01:14:21.734 --> 01:14:23.587
But you know the story. Amy!

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:26.786
Oh, sorry. Well, I'm a Global Concierge

01:14:26.788 --> 01:14:28.258
for Spontaneous Travel.

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.051
Thumbs up if you don't know what that is.

01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:33.185
And, um, three months
ago, I invited a stranger

01:14:33.187 --> 01:14:36.001
from the Internet on a
discount trip across Europe.

01:14:36.003 --> 01:14:38.240
That sounds like a plot to a horror film!

01:14:38.242 --> 01:14:41.215
Well, it was at first. We
almost killed each other.

01:14:41.217 --> 01:14:42.816
Seriously, like, he almost
chopped off her hand.

01:14:42.818 --> 01:14:45.440
Finger. It was complicated.

01:14:45.442 --> 01:14:47.583
Joshua and I met at a bad time.

01:14:47.585 --> 01:14:49.695
We were both running away from something,

01:14:49.697 --> 01:14:52.159
but instead, we found each other.

01:14:52.161 --> 01:14:54.717
Yet, here you are, months later,

01:14:54.719 --> 01:14:56.638
being courted by a guy whose mating call

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.998
is the world's loneliest
wet t-shirt contest.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.406
So, Amy, what happened?

01:15:01.408 --> 01:15:04.220
Is Joshua the one that got away?

01:15:04.222 --> 01:15:10.555
Well, the truth is, I messed up.

01:15:10.557 --> 01:15:14.938
I thought if I was organized
and focused and safe

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:18.394
that I could control the
future and avoid getting hurt.

01:15:18.396 --> 01:15:22.457
But life has a plan of its own.

01:15:22.459 --> 01:15:26.393
Look, I don't know where Joshua
is or why he's making these GIFs.

01:15:26.395 --> 01:15:27.994
It's pronounced "jiffs."

01:15:27.996 --> 01:15:30.233
We shared this incredible

01:15:30.235 --> 01:15:34.553
life-changing experience together.

01:15:34.555 --> 01:15:38.392
But it's over now. It ended.

01:15:38.394 --> 01:15:39.670
Well, you know what they say.

01:15:39.672 --> 01:15:41.750
- Vacation always comes to...
- No!

01:15:41.752 --> 01:15:43.509
Who actually says that?

01:15:43.511 --> 01:15:45.589
I always thought that
was part of growing up.

01:15:45.591 --> 01:15:47.829
The vacation ends. The honeymoon is over.

01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:49.814
Death and taxes. But I searched for it,

01:15:49.816 --> 01:15:52.086
and it's not an actual saying.

01:15:52.088 --> 01:15:55.764
Happiness doesn't have to
be temporary or special.

01:15:55.766 --> 01:15:57.749
There's no reason your
whole life can't feel

01:15:57.751 --> 01:15:59.796
like a vacation if you
find the right person.

01:15:59.798 --> 01:16:02.355
- Got him!
- Okay. All right. Thank you.

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:04.626
Yeah, I can take it from here.

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:07.283
Joshua.

01:16:07.285 --> 01:16:08.691
What are you doing here?

01:16:08.693 --> 01:16:10.450
I didn't pay my parking tickets.

01:16:10.452 --> 01:16:13.106
Now would be a good time to make a speech.

01:16:13.108 --> 01:16:14.290
Okay.

01:16:14.292 --> 01:16:16.273
Uh look, Amy.

01:16:16.275 --> 01:16:20.752
When we got separated, I
couldn't go back to my old life.

01:16:20.754 --> 01:16:22.640
I wanted to fix things.

01:16:22.642 --> 01:16:26.223
Joshua why don't you come talk
about that over here, on camera?

01:16:26.225 --> 01:16:28.430
I didn't have your number,
so I couldn't call you.

01:16:28.432 --> 01:16:31.343
I didn't know where you lived,
so I couldn't go to your house.

01:16:31.345 --> 01:16:33.966
So, I went to the one place
I knew I would find you.

01:16:33.968 --> 01:16:37.455
The Internet. I filled up every corner

01:16:37.457 --> 01:16:39.181
that I thought would get your attention.

01:16:39.183 --> 01:16:42.220
I mean, I showed millions of
people how I feel about you.

01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:43.884
But you didn't say it to me.

01:16:43.886 --> 01:16:46.924
I tried. I just wanted to finish the plan.

01:16:46.926 --> 01:16:48.939
Well, sometimes the plan changes.

01:16:48.941 --> 01:16:50.699
I don't want it to.

01:16:50.701 --> 01:16:53.100
I wanna go back to the way things were,

01:16:53.102 --> 01:16:55.083
when you grabbed my hand
and jumped in the water

01:16:55.085 --> 01:16:57.194
and changed my life forever.

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:59.307
Amy, we didn't fall in the ocean.

01:16:59.309 --> 01:17:01.897
We fell in love.

01:17:01.899 --> 01:17:05.897
And I will keep jumping
and jumping and jumping

01:17:05.899 --> 01:17:07.915
if it gets me back to you.

01:17:11.659 --> 01:17:14.343
Can someone turn off the cameras, please?

01:17:14.345 --> 01:17:15.722
On it.

01:17:28.615 --> 01:17:31.076
You think you can give
Josh Merit a third chance?

01:17:31.078 --> 01:17:36.836
No. I'm giving Michael
Merit a shot instead.

01:17:36.838 --> 01:17:38.596
- I'm not really a Michael.
- I felt that.

01:17:38.598 --> 01:17:39.655
Okay.

01:17:42.502 --> 01:17:44.579
If you guys could wrap
this up, there's a line.

01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:47.394
What is the hold up? Come on.

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:49.314
What is the hold-up?

01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:51.138
I'm gonna show you a hold-up.

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:54.049
So, what's the plan?

01:17:54.051 --> 01:17:56.867
We make it up.

01:17:58.594 --> 01:18:01.410

01:18:55.673 --> 01:18:57.399
Hey, adventurers.

01:18:57.401 --> 01:19:00.727
Apparently, Joshua has
a little surprise for me.

01:19:00.729 --> 01:19:03.191
- I planned us a trip.
- You planned.

01:19:03.193 --> 01:19:05.878
- I asked Robert to plan, but it didn't go very well.
- Oh, no.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.190

- Uh...

01:19:07.192 --> 01:19:09.368
