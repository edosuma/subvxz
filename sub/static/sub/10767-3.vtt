00:04.133 --> 00:06.408
Look, Will, we're almost there.

00:07.013 --> 00:09.686
Carlton, relax.
This is the line for class registration...

00:09.853 --> 00:11.684
...not the Nixon Library.

00:11.853 --> 00:14.413
Will, I took the liberty
of jotting out a few courses...

00:14.573 --> 00:16.564
...you might be interested in.

00:17.493 --> 00:21.168
Thank you, Carlton, but I already have
my academic priorities in order.

00:21.373 --> 00:22.931
Will, I'm proud of you.

00:23.093 --> 00:25.812
You're finally taking
your education seriously.

00:26.253 --> 00:27.481
Can I help you?

00:27.653 --> 00:30.042
Yes, I'll have what she's having.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.213 --> 01:44.842
Will, do you realize we stopped
and talked to every woman we saw?

01:45.013 --> 01:46.366
So?

01:46.533 --> 01:48.842
We were on the freeway.

01:49.733 --> 01:51.530
Why do you do these crazy things?

01:51.693 --> 01:55.481
The same reason Eddie Murphy
tries to sing, I like the challenge.

01:58.533 --> 02:00.922
Right, well, if you like
to be challenged so much...

02:01.093 --> 02:04.642
...how come you registered for classes
like Cheese Appreciation?

02:05.453 --> 02:09.651
Carlton, the challenge is
to make your life as easy as possible.

02:09.812 --> 02:11.804
That's why God made canned meat.

02:11.973 --> 02:14.567
- Spam cakes, anyone?
- Hey, man.

02:15.973 --> 02:17.452
- Morning.
- Hey, Uncle Phil.

02:17.653 --> 02:19.405
Geoffrey, something sure smells good.

02:19.573 --> 02:23.043
Patchouli, sweet of you to notice.

02:23.613 --> 02:26.081
So how was registration today, guys?

02:26.253 --> 02:28.164
Oh, yo, it was slamming, Uncle Phil.

02:28.373 --> 02:31.285
- He met a girl, right?
- You got it, big guy.

02:31.453 --> 02:33.683
And he joined classes
just because she's in it.

02:33.853 --> 02:37.641
- He doesn't even know what he's taking.
- I do too.

02:38.053 --> 02:39.042
Name it.

02:42.373 --> 02:44.648
Western Pornography.

02:46.453 --> 02:47.681
Western Philosophy.

02:48.773 --> 02:51.207
Western Philosophy? I'm impressed.

02:51.853 --> 02:54.003
You don't even know
what Western Philosophy is.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.050
I do too.

02:56.253 --> 02:57.527
It answers questions like:

02:57.693 --> 03:01.652
Did anybody really believe
Kool Moe Dee was a cowboy?

03:02.133 --> 03:05.921
<i>The wild wild west
The wild wild west</i>

03:06.093 --> 03:08.653
<i>I used to live downtown</i>

03:15.173 --> 03:17.403
- Ashley.
- I'm late for school, Daddy.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.245
Ashley!

03:20.053 --> 03:22.328
Could we see a little
compassion here?

03:22.493 --> 03:24.404
Hilary just lost her fiancÃ©.

03:24.573 --> 03:27.451
She could use a little sisterly comfort.

03:30.773 --> 03:33.685
I'm sorry. You're right.

03:37.333 --> 03:41.963
Hilary, this is your sister, Ashley.

03:42.413 --> 03:44.927
Suck it up, and get on with your life!

03:50.253 --> 03:52.050
Hilary.

03:52.213 --> 03:54.124
Sweetheart.

03:54.493 --> 03:55.721
How you feeling?

03:56.333 --> 03:59.530
I'm feeling much better, thanks.

04:00.213 --> 04:03.444
Now, now, baby, tell you what.

04:03.613 --> 04:06.047
Why don't you put on some clothes...

04:06.213 --> 04:08.602
...and hop in the car,
and drive over to Neiman's...

04:08.773 --> 04:10.047
...and do a little shopping.

04:10.533 --> 04:14.128
Oh, thanks, Daddy,
but I'm not ready to go out just yet.

04:14.613 --> 04:17.127
And you don't have to.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.891
Here.

04:20.213 --> 04:23.523
- I'll even look the number up for you.
- Hello, Neiman's?

04:25.533 --> 04:29.082
Listen, I want to order that adorable
Donna Karan pantsuit in your catalog.

04:29.253 --> 04:32.245
Item DK35712.

04:32.413 --> 04:35.849
Yeah, and on page 14,
there's this fabulous leather bag and...

04:36.013 --> 04:38.402
Oh, that would be cute.

04:40.333 --> 04:42.688
<i>Okay, okay,
attention Kmart shoppers.</i>

04:42.853 --> 04:45.731
We're running out of books
for Psych 157...

04:45.893 --> 04:48.930
...the study of human sexuality.

04:49.093 --> 04:51.049
So for any of you slimmies
who miss out...

04:51.213 --> 04:54.762
...I'll be more than happy to demonstrate
the contents of the book.

04:54.933 --> 04:57.811
Twice, you know.

04:59.853 --> 05:02.572
- Can I borrow that for a second?
- Oh, sure thing, boss lady.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.210
You're an idiot.

05:06.493 --> 05:09.246
There you go
making snap judgments again.

05:09.413 --> 05:12.962
- Hi, I need to get...
- Hey, Sting, kick some lyrics, man.

05:15.253 --> 05:17.562
Do you always have to embarrass me
in public?

05:17.773 --> 05:20.048
No, you do that all by yourself.

05:20.413 --> 05:23.211
What'd you sign up for today,
Advanced Sarcasm?

05:23.733 --> 05:26.645
Whatever I'm taking has gotta be
tougher than your schedule.

05:26.813 --> 05:29.168
What is Cheese Appreciation, anyway?

05:30.013 --> 05:33.449
Have you ever heard of a little thing
called Western Philosophy?

05:34.253 --> 05:36.005
You're taking Western Philosophy?

05:37.053 --> 05:42.127
I can see you're being seduced
by my intellectual prowess.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.968
Is that Spam in your teeth?

05:49.493 --> 05:51.723
I didn't have no Spam.

05:53.013 --> 05:55.004
Carlton, my bird.

05:57.253 --> 06:00.006
Excuse me,
you think I could possibly get some help?

06:00.213 --> 06:02.727
Well, Hair Club For Men
would be a good start.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.889
Nothing like that
minimum-wage humor.

06:12.693 --> 06:14.604
Look, my friend,
if it's not too taxing...

06:14.773 --> 06:17.685
...I'd like you to do a little work,
find these books for me.

06:17.853 --> 06:19.844
All right, all right,
just relax a second.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.801
Here, fill out this requisition form, and
I'll get them for you as soon as I can.

06:23.973 --> 06:26.533
Okay,
try to have it before graduation, okay?

06:26.733 --> 06:29.167
Sure thing, Skippy.

06:31.333 --> 06:34.484
You know, I'd stay and continue
this battle of wits with you...

06:34.653 --> 06:36.325
...but you're obviously unarmed.

06:40.013 --> 06:43.483
Hey, I'll be sure and take care
of this requisition form for you.

06:46.933 --> 06:48.651
He dribbles behind his back...

06:48.813 --> 06:50.041
...he's up and he shoots.

06:50.213 --> 06:51.965
Oh, and it's no good.

06:52.133 --> 06:56.490
Carlton the peacock says,
"Don't be a quitter, pick up your litter."

07:00.413 --> 07:01.812
Help me!

07:01.973 --> 07:03.884
Come on, guys, help me up.

07:04.893 --> 07:08.329
Yeah, we need a cleanup on aisle four.
We got some bird droppings.

07:12.213 --> 07:13.965
Excuse me...

07:14.133 --> 07:17.091
...but I think I've seen your picture
somewhere before.

07:17.493 --> 07:21.884
Oh, yeah, that's right,
it was in the dictionary next to:

07:23.613 --> 07:25.843
You have nothing better to do
than hit on me?

07:26.053 --> 07:30.251
Well, now, I don't know,
let me check my schedule.

07:30.413 --> 07:31.926
Nope, all clear.

07:33.173 --> 07:34.367
And...

07:34.573 --> 07:38.168
Plus, I don't have any early classes,
that means we could sleep in.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.402
You're relentless.

07:40.933 --> 07:43.652
Yeah, I don't give up, neither.

07:50.133 --> 07:53.409
Just think of me
as the Love Terminator.

07:54.133 --> 07:56.601
T2, meet my boyfriend, T-Rex.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.412
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

08:14.613 --> 08:18.572
Hey, Skippy, the Garth Brooks concert
must be over, huh?

08:19.253 --> 08:22.609
- You think I could get by?
- Well, not with those looks.

08:24.893 --> 08:28.169
I see you're hung up
on superficial facades.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.291
Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't speak geek.

08:32.013 --> 08:34.481
No, now, come on, come on, man.
I'm just kidding.

08:34.653 --> 08:36.371
Take a seat right here, next to me...

08:36.573 --> 08:38.962
...and observe a class clown
in his natural habitat.

08:39.133 --> 08:41.089
I get it.

08:41.253 --> 08:44.325
You're planning on giving the teacher
a real hard time, is that it?

08:44.573 --> 08:46.165
Well, you know, that's plan B.

08:46.373 --> 08:50.127
Plan A was derailed by this
refrigerator-shaped gentleman over here.

08:50.893 --> 08:54.044
I gotta tell you,
I see a real problem with Plan B.

08:54.213 --> 08:55.566
What's that?

08:55.733 --> 08:57.246
Watch.

08:59.093 --> 09:01.653
I am Professor Jeremy Mansfield...

09:01.813 --> 09:04.771
...and this is Western Philosophy.

09:05.413 --> 09:06.641
I'm Will Smith.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.771
And this is an interesting coincidence.

09:13.333 --> 09:17.406
Philosophy is all about
the perception of reality.

09:17.573 --> 09:19.529
And today's reality is...

09:19.693 --> 09:21.411
...this is a very difficult course.

09:21.573 --> 09:23.803
I am a very difficult man...

09:24.013 --> 09:28.643
...and I'm going to make your lives
very difficult.

09:28.933 --> 09:32.926
Excuse me, Professor Mansfield, it's not
too late to start sucking up, is it?

09:34.573 --> 09:36.086
There'll be a paper every week...

09:36.293 --> 09:39.091
...and a pop quiz
whenever I feel like having some fun...

09:39.253 --> 09:40.971
...and I'm a fun-loving guy.

09:41.133 --> 09:44.125
You will have five 20-page papers,
two midterms...

09:44.293 --> 09:46.045
...and a little cumulative final...

09:46.253 --> 09:49.609
...that I like to call the widow-maker.

09:52.573 --> 09:54.291
Thank you, Padre.

09:54.453 --> 09:57.923
Not so quick with the hair jokes now,
my friend?

09:59.573 --> 10:01.689
Well, work may be hard...

10:01.853 --> 10:05.482
...but I think in the long run...

10:05.653 --> 10:08.645
...you'll find this course electrifying.

10:08.813 --> 10:10.690
No, no, no! No, wait.

10:10.853 --> 10:13.321
Call my mother!
Somebody call the governor!

10:13.533 --> 10:17.048
I ain't even supposed to be in this class,
man!

10:17.413 --> 10:19.927
I wanna live.

10:31.373 --> 10:35.332
So, what I'm trying to do here,
Mr. Hosek, is just drop this one class.

10:41.973 --> 10:45.761
Okay, according to your schedule,
I would say it's Western Philosophy.

10:45.973 --> 10:47.201
Yeah, how'd you know that?

10:47.413 --> 10:51.201
It's the only course you're taking
that actually requires staying awake.

10:52.453 --> 10:55.968
Wait a minute, I have a really good
reason for wanting to drop that class.

10:56.173 --> 11:00.883
Yeah, and I'm sure my wife has
a really good reason for cheating on me.

11:02.133 --> 11:04.124
Look, man, I got problems of my own.

11:04.293 --> 11:05.612
You think you got problems?

11:05.773 --> 11:08.685
My wife has seen more action
than Chuck Norris.

11:09.293 --> 11:13.650
I got an office that used to be
the janitor's washroom. Look, here!

11:14.253 --> 11:15.652
I got a toilet in my closet!

11:16.853 --> 11:19.526
And every day I just see my career
going down it!

11:19.693 --> 11:22.207
Now, since registration...

11:24.173 --> 11:27.688
...is over, officially over,
the only way...

11:27.853 --> 11:32.449
...to get out of a class is to get
the instructor's written permission. Here.

11:36.933 --> 11:40.482
But I have to get
Professor Mansfield's signature?

11:40.653 --> 11:43.167
He's not gonna sign this.
There has to be another way.

11:43.373 --> 11:46.012
Well, actually, there... There is.

11:46.213 --> 11:48.329
Well, come on, man, tell me, tell me.

11:49.173 --> 11:50.606
Make it one of your demands...

11:50.773 --> 11:53.412
...when you climb the bell tower
with a rifle.

12:01.453 --> 12:04.411
Nurse, I'm ready to leave now.

12:08.293 --> 12:10.363
- Hi, Dad, how was court today?
- It was great.

12:10.533 --> 12:12.967
I got to send El Diablo up the river.

12:13.173 --> 12:14.686
El Diablo, the graffiti guy?

12:14.893 --> 12:16.963
He was the worst tagger
the city's ever known.

12:17.133 --> 12:20.091
It'll be a while before they see
his name around here again.

12:28.733 --> 12:29.722
Vivian.

12:30.893 --> 12:32.849
It's celery, I swear.

12:36.373 --> 12:38.011
Philip, what has gotten into you?

12:38.173 --> 12:42.769
The incarceration of a felon
always gets my juices pumping.

12:42.973 --> 12:46.363
Let's go upstairs and celebrate.

12:47.573 --> 12:49.450
Honey, we have a problem.

12:49.613 --> 12:53.049
- Hilary, your credit cards, I mean...
- After, after.

12:54.813 --> 12:56.405
See?

12:56.573 --> 12:57.926
So what? We're wealthy.

12:59.013 --> 13:01.891
You should have seen me deny
that man's plea bargain.

13:02.053 --> 13:05.841
I was brilliant!

13:11.133 --> 13:13.806
You're going upstairs aren't you?

13:14.493 --> 13:16.848
Yes, sweetheart. Is there a problem?

13:17.213 --> 13:21.650
I have no one in my life
to go upstairs with anymore.

13:23.773 --> 13:25.570
Lower.

13:26.933 --> 13:28.366
Honey, how about a rain check?

13:28.533 --> 13:32.412
Rain check?
Vivian, I am not a car wash.

13:32.573 --> 13:35.133
I have needs.

13:35.813 --> 13:37.087
So does Hilary.

13:37.573 --> 13:41.282
Honey, I'm sorry,
I will stay down here with you.

13:41.493 --> 13:42.687
Vivian!

13:45.413 --> 13:48.007
I'm ready for my wax job.

13:56.693 --> 13:58.729
Mr. Smith.

13:58.933 --> 14:00.651
Such a quiet entrance.

14:00.813 --> 14:02.690
Where's your... Your vim...

14:02.853 --> 14:04.332
...your verve...

14:04.493 --> 14:06.563
...your pedestrian wit?

14:07.013 --> 14:09.208
Why don't we stop
wasting each other's time.

14:09.373 --> 14:11.170
Just give me an F
and I'll be on my way.

14:11.373 --> 14:12.567
Will that make you happy?

14:12.773 --> 14:15.970
What would make me happy is
never having been here in the first place.

14:16.373 --> 14:19.763
Just get me a drop slip.
I'll make your wish a reality.

14:24.413 --> 14:27.371
You mean all I have to do
to get out of this class is ask?

14:27.533 --> 14:30.127
I don't want anybody in here
who doesn't wanna be here.

14:31.173 --> 14:33.050
Man, you gonna start a stampede.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.564
You know,
I take back everything I said about you.

14:39.533 --> 14:42.809
And give me a couple of hours
before you start your car.

14:43.493 --> 14:47.088
Psych. Or should I say "philosp."

14:50.653 --> 14:54.362
One of the central questions
of philosophy...

14:54.533 --> 14:56.489
...is the revelation of truth.

14:57.653 --> 14:58.881
Enjoy.

14:59.053 --> 15:00.566
Do you wanna know the truth?

15:00.773 --> 15:05.085
Do you wanna know the truth?
You can't handle the truth!

15:05.933 --> 15:07.332
Hey, that's Jack Nicholson.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.444
Mr. Smith,
if you wouldn't mind, please...

15:09.613 --> 15:12.081
...would you just beam yourself
out of here.

15:12.293 --> 15:14.887
- Captain Kirk, now that's fly.
- No, this is The Fly:

15:15.053 --> 15:17.123
"Help me! Help me!"

15:17.693 --> 15:20.924
Reality is, reality changes constantly.

15:21.133 --> 15:23.693
Yesterday's reality
may not necessarily be today's.

15:23.893 --> 15:25.087
Everybody got a pencil?

15:25.253 --> 15:27.847
Okay, good. Hold it up.
Little higher. Little lower.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.323
Perfect, right there.
Now break it in half.

15:32.013 --> 15:35.722
What a sound. From now on,
we're going to be using our minds.

15:36.053 --> 15:39.329
Hey, hey, give me a pencil.
Give me a pencil.

15:43.613 --> 15:45.808
This course isn't about taking notes.

15:45.973 --> 15:49.090
This course is about creative thinking.

15:49.253 --> 15:51.369
All right, look, conservatives, right?

15:51.573 --> 15:55.248
Liberals, rappers, skinheads...

15:55.413 --> 15:58.405
...nudists and televangelists,
they all have something in common.

15:58.573 --> 16:01.929
<i>- You know what it is?
- They all been on Montel Williams.</i>

16:05.213 --> 16:08.808
See, I can't hear you
because you no longer exist.

16:09.013 --> 16:11.686
But you could shove me, though, right?

16:12.733 --> 16:14.166
What they have in common is...

16:14.333 --> 16:18.531
...they all have
a distinct version of the truth.

16:18.693 --> 16:22.811
But do we really care what the truth is?
No, not really.

16:23.013 --> 16:25.652
We want to know,
"How come nobody loves me?"

16:25.853 --> 16:27.650
"Where's my next paycheck
coming from?"

16:27.893 --> 16:29.804
"How come
I never get any breaks in life?"

16:31.213 --> 16:34.649
Okay, let's get on our feet. We need
a couple of volunteers to start with.

16:34.813 --> 16:37.327
Let's get some people
who have a personal philosophy...

16:37.493 --> 16:39.802
...that is rooted in,
oh, I don't know, sex.

16:40.013 --> 16:42.322
Okay, that's what I thought.

16:42.493 --> 16:46.372
Nothing kinky, we just need two.
Denise, right? Denise and...

16:48.653 --> 16:51.770
Evan. Good.
All right, right up there.

16:52.253 --> 16:55.290
Now, don't be nervous.
You're gonna engage in a little dialectic.

16:55.453 --> 16:58.889
Dialectic is a ten-dollar word,
and it means "debate."

16:59.413 --> 17:00.641
Man!

17:00.813 --> 17:03.771
I should have never dropped out
of his class.

17:12.813 --> 17:14.326
Hey, Uncle Phil.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.690
- What you doing down here?
- I'm gonna tape Carlton's first pep rally.

17:17.853 --> 17:20.606
You have no idea how proud I am
that he's the peacock.

17:21.492 --> 17:23.404
Nope, not even a clue.

17:24.813 --> 17:27.167
You got a little time, though.
You want some grub?

17:27.373 --> 17:30.683
- I've already eaten.
- Is that a yes or a no?

17:34.373 --> 17:37.285
Man, this brings back memories.

17:37.453 --> 17:40.047
I bet you was in the top of your class
at Princeton, huh?

17:40.213 --> 17:42.602
Actually, far from it.

17:42.773 --> 17:45.731
I was spinning my wheels
until I met Matthew Langford.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.693
- Who's that, one of your professors?
- Not "one."

17:48.853 --> 17:50.172
The professor.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.005
Man changed my life.

17:52.173 --> 17:55.768
Turned a skinny kid from South Carolina
into the man you see today.

17:55.933 --> 17:57.161
And you know how?

17:57.333 --> 17:59.005
He challenged me.

17:59.173 --> 18:00.765
To what? A pie-eating contest?

18:02.173 --> 18:04.846
No, to having a fool as a nephew.

18:06.133 --> 18:07.202
I have this theory.

18:07.373 --> 18:11.491
I believe that everyone in college
has one special teacher that...

18:11.693 --> 18:15.732
That gives him an insight,
a glimpse into who they really are.

18:15.893 --> 18:17.372
You be on the lookout, Will.

18:18.133 --> 18:20.283
I think I found that dude already,
Uncle Phil.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.125
Already?

18:22.373 --> 18:24.967
I was in my third year
before I found Professor Langford.

18:25.773 --> 18:29.083
Let me tell you, this dude is hilarious.
I mean, he's fun, he's funny.

18:29.253 --> 18:32.848
He makes me think about stuff in a way
that I never even looked at it before.

18:34.453 --> 18:36.125
And I dropped his class.

18:38.573 --> 18:40.245
Let me guess.

18:40.413 --> 18:42.131
Western Philosophy, right?

18:42.773 --> 18:45.606
How does everybody know that?

18:46.013 --> 18:49.210
Because every time you're faced
with a challenge, you run for cover.

18:49.413 --> 18:51.927
Come on, now,
that is not true, Uncle Phil.

18:52.093 --> 18:54.812
I mean, this whole college thing
is just kind of new to me.

18:55.013 --> 18:57.049
Bull! It's old territory.

18:57.533 --> 19:00.969
I mean, you're always going on about
how you want to be out on your own...

19:01.133 --> 19:04.682
...and get respect.
But you don't do anything to earn it.

19:05.613 --> 19:07.046
I think it's my break time.

19:07.253 --> 19:09.721
What the hell is wrong with you,
anyway?

19:09.893 --> 19:11.770
I mean, you're smart, you're charming.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.845
You have gifts
that other people would kill to have.

19:15.013 --> 19:17.971
And what do you do? You throw it away
by taking the easy road.

19:19.053 --> 19:20.452
Uncle Phil, this is one class.

19:20.653 --> 19:24.123
No, this is not one class, Will.
This is your life.

19:24.333 --> 19:26.563
It's not my life,
it's not Carlton's life...

19:26.733 --> 19:29.122
...and you only get out of it
what you put into it.

19:29.413 --> 19:32.291
And you are off to one lousy start.

19:34.213 --> 19:37.091
But enough about me, Uncle Phil.
Let's talk about you.

19:38.973 --> 19:41.646
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

19:46.413 --> 19:49.086
Today's topic of conversation
is this glass.

19:49.253 --> 19:53.292
Is it A, half-empty, or B, half-full?

19:53.453 --> 19:56.251
Professor, it's an emergency,
you got to come out here.

19:56.653 --> 20:00.123
What's the matter, Will? Can't move
those oranges at the off-ramp?

20:00.773 --> 20:03.333
- I'm serious. You got to come out here.
- All right.

20:03.493 --> 20:07.566
Hey, listen, just wax philosophically
for a few moments by yourselves.

20:09.893 --> 20:12.532
All right, Will, what is it?
What did you want me to see?

20:12.693 --> 20:15.969
- Here it is, the new me.
- What happened to yesterday's you?

20:16.173 --> 20:19.643
Well, yesterday's reality
isn't necessarily today's.

20:19.813 --> 20:22.850
You're mastering the lingo.
I'm impressed.

20:23.253 --> 20:26.245
That's good,
because I wanna get back in your class.

20:26.413 --> 20:27.892
I'm sorry, Will...

20:28.053 --> 20:30.487
...some other student
already took your spot.

20:38.293 --> 20:39.487
No, no.

20:39.693 --> 20:41.809
Hey, come on,
Professor Mansfield, please.

20:41.973 --> 20:44.362
You gotta do me this favor, please.

20:45.093 --> 20:48.688
You come to me, my son,
asking for a favor.

20:48.893 --> 20:51.885
I'm gonna make you an offer
you can't refuse.

20:52.053 --> 20:53.771
I'm gonna let you back in this class.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.769
Thanks a lot, Godfather.

20:57.653 --> 21:01.407
Unfortunately, the class registrar is
closed, so you won't receive any credit.

21:02.293 --> 21:03.726
Wait, wait, whoa. Hold on.

21:03.893 --> 21:05.645
Freshmen have to carry 12 credits.

21:05.853 --> 21:09.892
I mean, I'd have to pick up another class,
plus do all the work in this one.

21:10.053 --> 21:12.647
You gotta love the irony, though, huh?

21:15.893 --> 21:17.884
- You got a deal.
- Good, take a seat.

21:18.093 --> 21:19.287
All right.

21:19.493 --> 21:23.008
This looks like a lovely seat right...
Right over there.

21:25.453 --> 21:28.047
Okay, here's another
oldie but a goodie.

21:28.213 --> 21:31.364
If a tree falls in the forest
and nobody's around to hear it...

21:31.533 --> 21:33.046
...does it make a sound?

21:33.253 --> 21:34.811
Yes, yeah, yes, it does.

21:36.493 --> 21:38.449
No, no, it don't.

21:40.053 --> 21:42.851
Well, no, well, you know,
yeah, it's a tree, it has to, yeah.

21:43.013 --> 21:45.288
Yeah, it... Well...

21:45.453 --> 21:47.842
How big is the tree?

21:49.893 --> 21:54.489
I mean, is it anywhere near a subway
or anything like that?

21:54.653 --> 21:57.531
And how close is this forest
to the ghetto?

21:58.893 --> 22:03.284
Okay, all right, how about if it landed
on, like, a gopher or something like that?

22:04.133 --> 22:08.365
Hey, does the noise
that the gopher makes count?

22:10.853 --> 22:14.004
Or what if it falls on Uncle Phil
and he hurt the tree?

22:18.653 --> 22:22.612
Will, I took the liberty of jotting out a
few courses you might be interested in.

22:22.773 --> 22:25.685
Carlton, thank you very much,
but I already have my academic...

22:25.853 --> 22:27.844
...stuff in order.

22:39.653 --> 22:41.644
Good job, Will.
