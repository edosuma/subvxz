WEBVTT

00:06.470 --> 00:10.098
<i>'Twas the night before Halloween
And all through Manhattan</i>

00:10.557 --> 00:16.187
<i>Not a criminal was stirring
Not even Green Goblin</i>

00:16.355 --> 00:18.941
<i>Might as well enjoy the peace
and quiet while I can.</i>

00:19.107 --> 00:22.611
<i>"Manhattan." "Goblin."
They sort of rhyme.</i>

00:22.819 --> 00:26.657
<i>So, Colonel Jameson,
any early trick-or-treaters up there?</i>

00:26.823 --> 00:28.909
Hope not. We're fresh out of candy.

00:29.076 --> 00:31.912
But seriously,
I still remember my first Halloween.

00:32.079 --> 00:34.706
I was an astronaut.
Big surprise, right?

00:34.873 --> 00:36.375
As much as I love the beauty...

00:36.542 --> 00:39.753
...and tranquility of space,
I'm glad we're landing tomorrow...

00:39.920 --> 00:42.881
...to see the costumes
of the next generation of dreamers.

00:43.048 --> 00:46.677
Plus, this year,
my astronaut costume rocks.

00:50.597 --> 00:52.349
Life-support's still up. Otherwise--

00:52.516 --> 00:56.186
Otherwise, it's,
"Houston, we have a problem."

02:03.670 --> 02:05.505
Heat shields are fairly trashed.

02:05.672 --> 02:07.674
Anyone know
a good body shop up here?

02:07.841 --> 02:10.844
<i>Although Colonel John Jameson
maintains his sense of humor...</i>

02:11.011 --> 02:15.349
<i>...the real question remains: Will the
shuttle be able to land safely?</i>

02:15.515 --> 02:19.603
<i>The damaged shield, coupled with
loss of the navigational computer...</i>

02:19.770 --> 02:21.480
<i>...greatly increases the hazard.</i>

02:21.647 --> 02:23.190
We heard from Foswell?

02:23.357 --> 02:26.443
Already in California,
awaiting the shuttle's landing.

02:26.610 --> 02:27.903
Assuming it does land.

02:28.070 --> 02:30.530
We'll just get out of your way,
Mr. Jameson.

02:30.697 --> 02:32.783
Shout out if you need anything.

03:20.622 --> 03:25.627
Keep laughing, Kermit.
I hear green's the new black-and-blue.

03:26.586 --> 03:33.260
You should be green with envy,
because you lack my fashion sense.

03:34.052 --> 03:37.305
Oh, and built-in gas mask.

03:45.397 --> 03:48.650
Goblin. I know you're out there.

03:48.817 --> 03:52.738
Out there. In here. Everywhere.

03:52.904 --> 03:56.032
Yes, this will soon be my town,
Hammie.

03:56.199 --> 03:59.745
And I could use
a good right-hand flattop.

03:59.911 --> 04:01.538
Not gonna happen.

04:01.705 --> 04:05.500
You think I'm afraid of a goofball
dressed for Halloween?

04:05.667 --> 04:08.086
Can't be afraid
of what you don't respect.

04:08.253 --> 04:12.257
And I've only ever respected
one man enough to fear.

04:12.424 --> 04:16.845
The Big Man,
alias I. Thompson Lincoln.

04:17.012 --> 04:19.639
See, I've already peeked
under his mask.

04:19.805 --> 04:23.894
Lincoln is the mask.
The Big Man's Tombstone.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.646
Because that's all that's left
when you cross him.

04:26.813 --> 04:28.398
Well, if that's true...

04:28.565 --> 04:34.446
...then a man like you must surely
have acquired life insurance.

04:35.572 --> 04:38.867
<i>The astronauts have done
all they can to repair the damage.</i>

04:39.034 --> 04:42.788
<i>Now Colonel Jameson has only
one chance to bring his crew home.</i>

04:42.954 --> 04:46.291
<i>He must manually pilot the craft
to reenter the Earth's atmosphere...</i>

04:46.458 --> 04:51.338
...at <i>precisely the right angle,
or they'll burn up on reentry.</i>

04:53.340 --> 04:55.967
- What's that, Harry?
- Nothing. New soda.

04:56.134 --> 04:58.136
- Then you won't mind giving me a sip.
- No.

04:58.303 --> 05:00.889
This is why you were passed out
the other night.

05:01.056 --> 05:03.850
Harry, whatever that stuff is,
you need help.

05:04.017 --> 05:05.811
This is the help.

05:05.977 --> 05:10.857
4.0 GPA, football stud, in-crowd,
all thanks to the Green.

05:11.024 --> 05:13.235
Harry, no.

05:16.238 --> 05:18.657
A few blackouts
are a small price to pay.

05:18.824 --> 05:22.994
So spare me your concern.
My life's great.

05:32.254 --> 05:33.964
Dial Hammerhead.

05:35.215 --> 05:38.802
Oh, I'm sorry, Hammerhead
can't come to the phone right now.

05:38.969 --> 05:42.013
He's a bit tied up.

05:43.306 --> 05:45.183
You gotta love the classics.

05:45.350 --> 05:47.686
Hammerhead can take care of himself.

05:47.853 --> 05:50.480
And you as well, apparently.

05:50.647 --> 05:54.401
He had a portable jump drive
with enough incriminating evidence...

05:54.568 --> 05:58.905
...to put dear Mr. Lincoln
behind bars forever.

05:59.072 --> 06:04.077
Not to worry. The drive's
in little old (Bobby's possession now.

06:06.663 --> 06:10.083
I don't have it on me.
But I will have it tonight.

06:10.250 --> 06:14.170
- When tonight? Where?
- Believe me, you'll know.

06:14.337 --> 06:16.798
I know a trap when I--

06:16.965 --> 06:22.721
But that's what makes it fun.
Besides, what choice do you have?

06:22.888 --> 06:25.432
Oh, and come alone.

06:32.397 --> 06:35.692
<i>How does she do it?
One look, and next thing you know...</i>

06:35.859 --> 06:38.612
<i>...I'm swinging across town
to have a talk with Harry.</i>

06:38.778 --> 06:42.741
<i>Oh, look who's finally showing
his ugly rubber face.</i>

06:47.037 --> 06:50.123
- Landed me a big one.
- Who's landed whom?

06:54.252 --> 06:57.797
- Where you been, Greeny? Vacation?
- Been looking for you.

07:05.055 --> 07:08.433
We both want Tombstone
out of the picture.

07:08.642 --> 07:12.979
- For totally different reasons.
- Details, details.

07:13.146 --> 07:14.439
And speaking of details...

07:14.606 --> 07:18.610
...I've got a jump drive that
can take Tombstone down for good.

07:18.777 --> 07:20.820
Great. Fork it over.
I'll take you both in.

07:21.780 --> 07:26.159
I don't have it on me.
But I'll have it tonight.

07:26.326 --> 07:29.746
- When tonight? Where?
- Anyone else getting déjé vu?

07:29.913 --> 07:31.456
Oh, well. Let's run with it.

07:31.623 --> 07:34.626
Believe me, you'll know.

07:43.802 --> 07:46.638
<i>If Gwen's right, losing Gobby
will seem way less painful...</i>

07:46.805 --> 07:49.224
<i>...than talking to Harry.</i>

07:56.356 --> 07:58.942
<i>Not even sure if Gobby came in here.</i>

07:59.109 --> 08:02.612
<i>But he wouldn't be the first wackadoo
to target Harry's dad.</i>

08:04.531 --> 08:07.784
<i>Been coming here for years,
and I've never seen that door before.</i>

08:09.536 --> 08:14.666
<i>No. I mean, so the guy likes masks.
But that doesn't mean that he--</i>

08:15.208 --> 08:17.877
<i>Yeah, besides,
Gobby keeps stealing OsCorp tech.</i>

08:18.044 --> 08:23.425
<i>So unless those thefts were staged
to throw off suspicion...</i>

08:23.591 --> 08:24.884
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

08:25.051 --> 08:27.470
<i>Oh, great.
Now Harry's got two problems.</i>

08:27.637 --> 08:30.306
<i>How can I talk to him about either
with Green Gosborn...</i>

08:30.473 --> 08:32.976
-...in the next room?
- Dad?

08:46.364 --> 08:48.700
I'm not kidding, Harry.
We need to talk.

08:48.867 --> 08:52.412
- Then come on up.
- Not a good idea. Just come down.

08:52.579 --> 08:55.915
Oh, so you can give me an earful
for Gwen? No, thanks.

08:56.082 --> 08:57.751
<i>Besides, I need to get in costume.</i>

08:57.917 --> 09:00.754
<i>I'll meet you in an hour
at the Bleecker Street Carnival.</i>

09:08.219 --> 09:10.889
Thanks for supporting Midtown High,
and happy Halloween.

09:11.056 --> 09:16.102
I mean...matey. Enjoy the cookie.

09:16.269 --> 09:17.729
It's Gwen, right?

09:18.646 --> 09:20.440
Hi. Hi, Mary Jane.

09:20.607 --> 09:22.484
I need to find Pete.
Have you seen him?

09:22.650 --> 09:25.153
- I was going to ask you.
- He went to talk to Harry--

09:25.320 --> 09:29.240
<i>Lean to the left, lean to the right
Stand up, sit down, fight, fight, fight</i>

09:29.407 --> 09:31.534
<i>Go, Mustangs!</i>

09:32.452 --> 09:35.080
- Shake those pom-poms!
- Yeah, shake tho--

09:35.246 --> 09:37.248
Wait. Are they mocking us?

09:37.415 --> 09:41.753
<i>Trick or treat, smell my feet
Give me something good to eat</i>

09:41.920 --> 09:45.757
Oh, come on. You're not gonna
break up with me over a cookie.

09:45.924 --> 09:47.634
Are you?

09:48.593 --> 09:54.432
- So you as dangerous as you look?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

09:56.935 --> 09:59.270
You haven't complimented
my costume.

09:59.437 --> 10:02.690
- Trying to get the latest on the shuttle.
- Which matters to me, why?

10:02.857 --> 10:06.277
Maybe because John Jameson's
like an older brother to me.

10:07.862 --> 10:09.447
<i>And because he may not make it.</i>

10:09.614 --> 10:12.450
<i>I'm told that as the shuttle
enters Earth's atmosphere...</i>

10:12.617 --> 10:14.953
<i>...NASA Will likely lose contact.</i>

10:15.120 --> 10:17.872
Whatever happens, Foswell,
you give it to me straight.

10:18.081 --> 10:21.626
<i>Sure, J.J., straight.</i>

10:24.129 --> 10:27.715
Fasten your seat belts.
It's gonna be a bumpy night.

10:37.892 --> 10:40.353
<i>Nothing yet, boss. Nothing.</i>

10:41.354 --> 10:43.398
Nothing.

10:43.857 --> 10:46.484
J.J., I'm sorry.

10:47.026 --> 10:48.695
Wait. There it is.

10:49.654 --> 10:51.823
It's landing.

10:59.372 --> 11:02.834
- They're safe!
- Yeah! All right!

11:03.001 --> 11:04.169
- Yeah!
- All right!

11:04.335 --> 11:07.672
He did it. My boy did it.

11:07.839 --> 11:10.592
Hey, hey. I'm not paying you bums
to watch television.

11:10.758 --> 11:13.845
Get me a new layout in 17 seconds,
or you're all fired.

11:14.012 --> 11:15.513
Go, go, go!

11:15.680 --> 11:18.433
Congratulations, boss.
It's great news.

11:18.641 --> 11:21.102
It's the news. What are these?

11:21.269 --> 11:23.271
A couple of freaks in costumes.
Worthless.

11:23.438 --> 11:29.110
The Bugle's celebrating a real hero,
my son, John.

11:29.277 --> 11:32.447
- But what do I do with--?
- Sell them to the <i>Globe,</i> for all I care.

11:32.655 --> 11:35.200
That rag will print anything.

11:37.410 --> 11:39.913
Mr. Osborn.
Didn't expect to see you back tonight.

11:40.079 --> 11:43.041
- Through the front door no less.
- You wanna rule the world...

11:43.208 --> 11:44.959
...you don't punch time clocks.

11:52.717 --> 11:57.430
- Mr. Osborn. He took it, stole it.
- A thief? Here? What did he steal?

11:57.597 --> 12:00.225
- The Inhibitor prototype.
- Freeze, dirtbag.

12:18.243 --> 12:20.119
<i>- Gwen'?
- Oh, Peter, finally.</i>

12:20.286 --> 12:22.580
<i>I've been calling and--
What's up with Harry?</i>

12:22.747 --> 12:27.252
He's meeting me at the carnival.
I'm already here. Where are you?

12:28.336 --> 12:31.172
- Pete?
- Nice costume, huh?

12:31.339 --> 12:33.424
I'm gonna cream Osborn.

12:33.591 --> 12:36.511
The little wimp was supposed
to be the top of our pyramid.

12:37.762 --> 12:42.350
Hey, look.
It's the Spectacular Spider-Geek.

12:44.644 --> 12:47.522
Gotta say, tiger,
you fill out that costume nicely.

12:47.730 --> 12:51.943
Very nicely.
You can web me up anytime, Petey.

12:52.110 --> 12:55.280
Puny Parker?
He looks nothing like Spidey.

12:55.446 --> 12:58.199
- I should've been Spider-Man.
- Don't worry, Flash.

12:58.366 --> 13:00.326
You fill out your costume nicely too.

13:10.545 --> 13:13.965
- Goblin.
- Pete, we really should find Harry.

13:14.132 --> 13:15.466
Pete?

13:24.309 --> 13:27.228
So Gobby offered you
the secret-toy surprise too.

13:27.395 --> 13:28.521
<i>- Trap'?
Wrap</i>

13:28.688 --> 13:30.773
Yeah, figured. Race you inside.

13:36.404 --> 13:37.780
Always with the drama.

13:40.867 --> 13:44.037
- This is so embarrassing.
- And disappointing.

13:44.203 --> 13:47.081
Did you really think you needed
a jump drive to protect you?

13:47.290 --> 13:49.584
Did you think
a jump drive could protect you?

13:49.792 --> 13:52.170
Come on, boss,
you can't have fallen for that.

13:52.337 --> 13:54.589
There's no drive,
no incriminating evidence.

13:54.797 --> 13:59.844
- There never was.
- Yes, yes, I'm a big fat liar.

14:02.555 --> 14:06.184
Like we didn't all know
this was a trap.

14:17.195 --> 14:20.490
Welcome to the Green Goblin's
House of Horror.

14:20.656 --> 14:25.453
Or should I say
Refinery of Revulsion?

14:50.978 --> 14:52.647
- Thanks?
- Take down the Goblin...

14:52.814 --> 14:55.274
...or at least unmask him,
and we'll call it even.

14:55.441 --> 14:58.903
Excuse me. Who rescued who
from the molten steel?

15:04.659 --> 15:06.619
Wipeout.

15:28.182 --> 15:30.685
Next time you throw a bash, Gobby,
leave out snacks.

15:30.852 --> 15:33.229
Your guests will stay longer.

15:33.396 --> 15:39.902
How embarrassing.
But at least I brought party favors.

15:56.419 --> 15:58.254
Terrifying, huh?

15:58.421 --> 16:01.090
Or is nothing scary
after seeing me in a skirt?

16:01.257 --> 16:02.550
The skirt's cool.

16:02.717 --> 16:05.344
I know you lost a bet,
but you made the best of it.

16:05.511 --> 16:07.096
Glad you feel that way.

16:07.263 --> 16:09.724
I mean,
now that me and Liz have split up--

16:09.891 --> 16:12.185
Pom-poms to yourself, big guy.

16:12.351 --> 16:15.563
I like you,
but I won't be your replacement girl.

16:15.730 --> 16:20.109
This redhead's a free agent.
Plans to keep it that way.

16:20.568 --> 16:25.615
No Harry. No Pete.
Someone is so getting the look.

16:29.535 --> 16:31.370
Why don't you just give up?

16:35.458 --> 16:39.170
Because I know your secret. I know
whose face is behind that mask.

16:39.337 --> 16:43.299
We all wear masks, Spider-Man.
But which one is real?

16:43.466 --> 16:47.637
The one that hides your face,
or the one that is your face?

16:48.846 --> 16:50.806
I know you're Norman Osborn.

16:52.099 --> 16:53.309
Am I?

16:53.768 --> 16:58.564
Impressive webbing. Now try mine.

17:21.753 --> 17:25.090
So, what do you think
of my Gob-webs?

17:25.258 --> 17:31.722
Now, let's see what cracks first,
my Gob-webs or your bones.

17:33.140 --> 17:35.142
Well, that taught us nothing.

17:35.309 --> 17:38.646
Perhaps a more drastic experiment
is required.

17:39.897 --> 17:42.275
Happy landing, Spider-Man.

17:44.318 --> 17:45.444
This better work.

17:57.206 --> 18:01.877
Okay, all this pain
at least proves I'm still alive.

18:21.105 --> 18:22.898
Oh, right. Kind of used it all up.

18:31.365 --> 18:35.411
<i>Go ahead, run.
I know where you live.</i>

18:38.873 --> 18:39.915
I knew it.

18:45.463 --> 18:47.798
- You're the Green Goblin?
- No.

18:47.965 --> 18:51.552
This isn't my costume.
I'm a cheerleader.

18:51.719 --> 18:54.555
- Harry? Spider-Man? What is--?
- You're not limping.

18:54.722 --> 18:57.391
Why would I be limping?
Why is Harry wearing...?

18:57.892 --> 19:00.102
- Where did this come from?
- Dad, I--

19:00.269 --> 19:02.313
- What is it?
- Globulin Green.

19:02.480 --> 19:05.358
An early-stage,
experimental performance enhancer.

19:05.524 --> 19:10.571
Highly unstable and addictive.
You stole it from OsCorp, didn't you?

19:10.738 --> 19:14.367
Why would you do something
so dangerous? So stupid?

19:16.452 --> 19:17.578
For you.

19:20.414 --> 19:22.208
You told me to man up.

19:22.375 --> 19:25.961
So I took the Green to become the son
you always wanted me to be.

19:26.128 --> 19:30.549
To become a man, like you.

19:34.303 --> 19:40.142
I must've blacked out again. I--
I don't remember anything.

19:40.559 --> 19:43.604
But I can't be the Goblin. Can I?

19:45.940 --> 19:48.776
I never should've taken it.

19:48.943 --> 19:52.071
I ruined everything. I'm sorry.

19:52.238 --> 19:56.826
- I'm so, so sorry.
- This makes no sense. If Ha--

19:56.992 --> 20:00.037
If this kid's the Goblin,
why would he attack the Big Man?

20:00.204 --> 20:04.542
- Why attack OsCorp?
- I've had dealings with the Big Man.

20:04.709 --> 20:08.629
But when I tried to extricate myself,
I was threatened by his stooge.

20:08.796 --> 20:11.966
- Hammerhead.
- Harry must've overheard.

20:12.133 --> 20:15.469
Under the influence of the Green,
his subconscious created someone...

20:15.636 --> 20:17.513
...who could take the Big Man down.

20:18.139 --> 20:23.769
- Now, as to why he attacked me...
- Maybe I've got some anger issues.

20:24.270 --> 20:28.232
I will not allow this.
I'll say I was the Goblin.

20:28.399 --> 20:32.153
After all, I invented the Green.
I'm the obvious suspect.

20:32.319 --> 20:36.073
No. He needs you.
And what good could you do him...

20:36.240 --> 20:38.576
...locked away
for a crime you didn't commit?

20:38.743 --> 20:44.540
Didn't I? This is all my fault.
I drove Harry to...

20:45.082 --> 20:47.877
I will get him help, I swear.

20:48.043 --> 20:50.463
- If you'll let me.
- Me?

20:50.629 --> 20:54.425
If you turn him in, if the Big Man
learns Harry was the Goblin...

20:54.592 --> 20:57.052
...he wouldn't survive the night.

20:57.219 --> 21:00.473
Please. He's my only child.

21:00.639 --> 21:02.683
<i>And my best friend.</i>

21:02.850 --> 21:05.728
The Goblin disappears forever...

21:05.895 --> 21:08.481
...leaving a mystery
that never gets solved.

21:08.647 --> 21:09.690
Thank you.

21:17.490 --> 21:20.576
And why should I care
what the <i>Globe</i> runs on its front page?

21:20.743 --> 21:24.163
Because their Spider-Man scoop,
and Parker's pictures of it...

21:24.330 --> 21:27.208
...slaughtered our space-shuttle
coverage at the newsstands.

21:27.374 --> 21:29.502
The people have spoken.

21:29.668 --> 21:34.256
Get that traitor Parker in here
and lock him into an exclusive deal.

21:34.423 --> 21:38.511
If they want Spider-Man,
we'll give them Spider-Man.

21:38.677 --> 21:45.142
Here's tomorrow's front-page headline:
"Spider-Man: threat or menace?"

21:46.018 --> 21:48.813
- Hey, tiger.
- Oh, hey, M.J.

21:48.979 --> 21:53.192
- M.J.? What are you doing here?
- I go to school here now.

21:53.359 --> 21:55.361
Midtown's Theater Magnet
accepted me.

21:55.528 --> 21:58.656
I wanted to tell you last night,
but you disappeared.

21:58.823 --> 22:03.619
- As usual.
- Sorry. I went looking for Harry.

22:03.786 --> 22:07.414
- But I never found him.
- Then you probably haven't heard.

22:07.581 --> 22:12.002
Harry's taking a leave of absence
from school to travel abroad...

22:12.169 --> 22:14.755
...and get the help he needs.

22:14.922 --> 22:19.510
And that makes it
a happy ending, right?

22:23.180 --> 22:26.141
So, Colonel Jameson,
good to be home?

22:27.142 --> 22:30.312
Yep. Back on solid ground.

22:31.105 --> 22:34.316
Where it's nice and safe.
