10:46.863 --> 10:50.127
OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR INPUT.

10:50.171 --> 10:53.304
CHO, YOU GOT ANYTHING?

10:53.348 --> 10:55.306
UNIFORMS FOUND A CREDIT CARD
RECEIPT IN HIS CAR.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.873
HE HAD DINNER LAST NIGHT
AT A RESTAURANT

10:56.917 --> 10:58.309
CALLED CAFE TUSCANY.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.008
GO THERE. SEE WHAT THEY CAN
TELL YOU ABOUT HIM.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.488
THE VICTIM'S FATHER WAS
AN APPELLATE COURT JUDGE.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.360
I NEED TO GO AND TALK TO HIM.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.361
ROGER THAT.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.493
I'M HEADED BACK TO SACRAMENTO.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.147
YOU WANT ME TO DROP YOU OFF
SOMEWHERE ON THE WAY?

11:10.191 --> 11:12.584
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.695
UH, SO HOW DOES THIS WORK?

11:35.738 --> 11:38.610
I GO IN. ASK THE PEOPLE
QUESTIONS.

11:38.654 --> 11:39.611
THEY'RE PROBABLY
PRETTY UPSET.

11:39.655 --> 11:42.440
MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO TELL ME MUCH.

11:42.484 --> 11:46.618
IT DOESN'T HELP TO HAVE
OTHER PEOPLE AROUND.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.620
YOU--YOU WANT ME
TO STAY HERE?

11:48.664 --> 11:49.839
I WOULD PREFER THAT.

11:49.883 --> 11:50.884
SURE. NO--NO PROBLEM.

11:50.927 --> 11:54.061
I DON'T--I DON'T WANT
TO INTRUDE.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.759
AGENT LISBON, DO YOU MIND
IF WE TALK OUT HERE?

11:56.803 --> 11:59.457
MY WIFE'S
EXTREMELY DISTRAUGHT.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.721
I'D RATHER
SHE DIDN'T HEAR US.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.898
THIS IS, UM, PATRICK JANE.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.596
PLEASURE.
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

12:12.601 --> 12:16.039
HAD YOU AND YOUR WIFE
HEARD FROM YOUR SON RECENTLY?

12:16.083 --> 12:18.955
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE
LAST WEEK.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.870
WAS HE IN SOME SORT OF TROUBLE?

12:20.914 --> 12:23.786
AGENT, I HAVE
THE SICKENING FEELING

12:23.830 --> 12:26.746
THAT THIS HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH WINSTON.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.051
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

12:28.095 --> 12:29.792
I'VE PUT A LOT OF
DESPERATE INDIVIDUALS

12:29.836 --> 12:31.315
INTO PRISON OVER THE YEARS.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.753
ANY ONE OF THEM
MIGHT BE BEHIND THIS.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.058
WHY WOULD THEY GO AFTER HIM?

12:35.102 --> 12:36.146
WHY NOT YOU?

12:36.190 --> 12:38.888
YOU WANT TO HURT A MAN?

12:38.932 --> 12:40.803
DON'T KILL HIM.

12:40.847 --> 12:43.284
KILL HIS FAMILY.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.897
WE'LL CERTAINLY
LOOK INTO THAT.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.856
ALCOHOLISM.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.597
TERRIBLE THING.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.904
WINSTON WAS DRINKING AGAIN?

12:54.948 --> 12:58.603
WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL AFTER
WE GET THE LAB REPORTS BACK.

12:58.647 --> 13:01.432
SO...

13:01.476 --> 13:03.695
YOU'RE SIMPLY
CASTING ASPERSIONS?

13:03.739 --> 13:06.829
NO. I--I JUST...

13:06.873 --> 13:09.440
I ASSUMED FROM YOUR MANNER...

13:09.484 --> 13:10.790
FROM WHAT MANNER, SIR?

13:10.833 --> 13:13.967
YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT
IN HIM.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.317
WITH REGARD TO MY SON,
MR. JANE,

13:16.360 --> 13:18.885
IT'S MYSELF
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN.

13:20.887 --> 13:21.844
HE'S MY FAILURE.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.977
DO YOU HAVE A CHILD,
MR. JANE?

13:24.020 --> 13:26.022
NO.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.808
WELL, THEN YOU
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

13:30.548 --> 13:33.725
IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE,
AGENT LISBON?

13:33.769 --> 13:34.770
NO, SIR.

13:38.774 --> 13:42.299
[Lisbon] DELLINGER CHAIRS
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT APPEALS COURT.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.736
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TROUBLE
I COULD GET IN

13:44.780 --> 13:45.737
IF HE'S PISSED OFF?

13:45.781 --> 13:47.217
NO. HOW MUCH?

13:47.261 --> 13:49.524
A LOT.
WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND--

13:49.567 --> 13:51.134
[cell phone rings]

13:51.178 --> 13:53.484
YEAH?

13:53.528 --> 13:54.877
HANG ON, CHO.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.014
EXCUSE ME.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.761
GO ON.

14:09.805 --> 14:12.155
JUST TALKED TO THE MAITRE D'
AT CAFE TUSCANY.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.765
SAID DELLINGER CAME IN
LAST NIGHT WITH A WOMAN.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.767
Said she seemed
a little low-rent.

14:15.811 --> 14:16.812
Dellinger got so drunk,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.161
the woman left
before dinner arrived.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.859
REALLY?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.991
Also talked to the cab company
that picked up Dellinger's date.

14:22.035 --> 14:22.992
HER NAME'S KELLY BURBAGE.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.385
SHE'S COMING IN TOMORROW.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.386
THANKS.

14:25.429 --> 14:26.430
[phone snaps shut]

14:29.259 --> 14:30.217
YOU WERE RIGHT.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.001
THE VICTIM WAS ON A DATE.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.785
GOOD CALL.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.700
COLD READING.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.877
COLD READING?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.356
YOU, FOR INSTANCE.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.229
YOU... CARED
FOR A DYSFUNCTIONAL PARENT.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.404
FATHER, PROBABLY.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.884
THAT'S WHY
YOU PUT UP WITH HANNIGAN.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.582
I DON'T PUT UP
WITH HANNIGAN.

14:47.625 --> 14:51.064
HIS UNHAPPINESS REMINDS YOU
OF YOUR FATHER'S UNHAPPINESS.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.457
WE'RE DONE FOR THE DAY.

14:53.501 --> 14:56.025
IS THERE SOMEWHERE
I COULD DROP YOU OFF?

14:56.069 --> 14:59.811
WHAT ABOUT THE RED JOHN FILES?

14:59.855 --> 15:04.904
MR. JANE, I TRULY SYMPATHIZE.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.427
I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.559
I WOULD PROBABLY FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

15:08.603 --> 15:12.912
BUT NOTHING GOOD WILL COME
FROM CHASING THIS MAN.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.654
IT'S THE KIND OF OBSESSION
THAT DESTROYS PEOPLE.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.700
GO SOMEPLACE ELSE.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.922
TRY TO GET ON
WITH YOUR LIFE.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.926
THAT'S JUST
WHAT HANNIGAN SAID.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.325
COME TO THE OFFICE
IN THE MORNING.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.980
BUT CLEAN YOURSELF UP.

15:38.024 --> 15:38.981
YOU'RE A MESS.

15:45.814 --> 15:46.946
[engine starts]

15:46.989 --> 15:50.079
[dashboard alert dinging]GET IN. NOW.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.574
HI.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.098
HEY.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.970
IT'S KIMBALL CHO,
ISN'T IT?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.189
IS THAT AFTER
THE KIPLING CHARACTER?

16:13.233 --> 16:14.974
NO. WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

16:15.017 --> 16:16.976
AGENT LISBON
TOLD ME TO COME BY.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.500
TO READ THE RED JOHN FILES.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.980
HEY.HEY.

16:24.766 --> 16:27.899
LISBON TOLD HIM TO COME BY.
READ THE RED JOHN FILES.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.684
HI.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.991
ALL RIGHT. HI.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.036
OH, PRETEND I'M NOT HERE.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.472
UH, OKAY.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.735
KELLY BURBAGE. GIRL WHO
HAD DINNER WITH THE VICTIM.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.999
INTERVIEW THREE.ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.053
YOU CAN TAKE THE DESK
OVER THERE.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.011
NO ONE'S USING THAT.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.147
UH, YEAH.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.849
MISS BURBAGE,

17:04.893 --> 17:07.069
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WINSTON DELLINGER?

17:07.113 --> 17:08.549
I WORK TENDING BAR

17:08.592 --> 17:10.377
AT THE THIRSTY PUP
IN HAGGINWOOD?

17:10.420 --> 17:12.248
WINSTON'S A REGULAR.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.902
HE HAS A DRINKING PROBLEM.

17:13.945 --> 17:16.078
IT'S A BAR.

17:16.122 --> 17:16.948
WHAT HAPPENED AT DINNER?

17:16.992 --> 17:18.385
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.735
HE CLIMBED THROUGH
TWO BOTTLES OF HOUSE RED

17:20.778 --> 17:23.259
BEFORE I EVEN GOT
MY PASTA POMODORO.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.783
I TOLD HIM HE WAS
TOO DRUNK TO DRIVE ME HOME.

17:25.827 --> 17:28.177
HE GOT MAD, I GOT A CAB.

17:28.221 --> 17:31.920
LOOK, IF THIS IS BECAUSE WINSTON
DID SOMETHING LAST NIGHT,

17:31.963 --> 17:34.053
IT'S JUST BECAUSE
HE WAS SMASHED.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.445
HE WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.534
HE'S DEAD. HE WAS
KILLED LAST NIGHT.

17:37.578 --> 17:38.535
WHAT?

17:38.579 --> 17:40.102
SOMEBODY SHOT HIM.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.104
NOT TWO HOURS
AFTER HE LEFT THE RESTAURANT.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.019
ANY IDEA
WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT?

17:47.588 --> 17:48.545
OH, MY GOD.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.069
THAT SOUNDS LIKE "YES."

17:51.157 --> 17:53.072
THERE'S--THERE'S THIS GUY...

17:53.115 --> 17:55.291
WE USED TO DATE,

17:55.335 --> 17:57.119
BUT I BROKE IT OFF
BECAUSE HE WAS

17:57.163 --> 17:59.078
THIS GIGANTIC BALL
OF NEGATIVITY.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.296
SURE.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.125
HE CALLED ME LAST NIGHT
AFTER I GOT HOME.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.431
TOTALLY MESSED UP.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.302
HE SAID HE'D FOLLOWED ME
ON THE DATE.

18:06.346 --> 18:10.001
HE KEPT TALKING ABOUT
WHAT A LOSER WINSTON WAS,

18:10.045 --> 18:11.220
AND HOW HE DIDN'T DESERVE ME.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.482
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

18:12.526 --> 18:14.571
EMMETT.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.138
EMMETT COX.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.489
HEY, BOSS.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.143
COX HAS TWO ARRESTS FOR ASSAULT

18:21.187 --> 18:22.449
AND A GUN CHARGE PENDING.

18:22.492 --> 18:23.450
NICE.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.278
IS THIS ADDRESS
STILL CURRENT?

18:25.321 --> 18:26.496
BURBAGE THINKS SO.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.107
YOU AND HANNIGAN SEE
IF YOU CAN LOCATE HIM,

18:28.150 --> 18:29.499
BRING HIM IN.

18:29.543 --> 18:34.069
SEEMS LIKE A REAL CHARMER.
FULL S.W.A.T. PROTOCOL.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.463
HE SAID YOU SAID
HE WAS ALLOWED TO BE HERE.

18:36.506 --> 18:37.638
YES, I DID.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.119
I DIDN'T THINK
HE'D ACTUALLY SHOW UP.

18:40.162 --> 18:43.122
GO GET COX.YES, BOSS.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.123
MR. JANE!

18:50.216 --> 18:52.435
MR. JANE.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.133
YOU--YOU CAN CALL ME PATRICK.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.047
PATRICK, HAVE A SEAT.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.397
THANK YOU.

18:57.440 --> 19:01.183
[clears throat
and sighs]

19:02.837 --> 19:04.099
YOU WERE HOPING
I WOULDN'T COME BACK?

19:05.187 --> 19:06.623
YES.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.322
FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THE FILES.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.193
YOUR BOSS SAID I COULD.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.806
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.505
I SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST START A NEW LIFE.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.162
I CAN'T.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.818
I WILL HAVE THE FILES SENT UP.
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.516
MEANWHILE, YOU STAY IN HERE.

19:29.559 --> 19:32.171
I DON'T MIND WAITING OUT THERE.
I DON'T WANT TO BE A BURDEN.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.869
YOU'RE KIND OF
A DISTRACTION TO THE OFFICE.

19:34.912 --> 19:38.481
NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU HAVE A BIT
OF A HOMELESS VIBE ABOUT YOU.

19:38.525 --> 19:41.310
I CLEANED UP,
LIKE YOU, UH, TOLD ME TO.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.921
IT'S A PROCESS, HUH?

19:47.273 --> 19:48.404
YOU KNOW.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.149
[man] COME ON.

19:55.281 --> 19:58.501
HAVE A SEAT. GO ON.
SCOOT UP.

19:58.545 --> 20:01.635
[filtered voice]
THERE YOU GO. THAT'S IT.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.682
OKAY, EMMETT, CUT THE CRAP

20:05.726 --> 20:06.727
AND TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.119
BITE ME.
I DONE NOTHING WRONG.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.341
WELL, IF YOU DONE
NOTHING WRONG,

20:12.385 --> 20:15.866
THEN THERE'S NO REASON
NOT TO TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.303
[exhales]

20:18.478 --> 20:21.263
I FOLLOWED KEL AND THAT DUDE
TO THE RESTAURANT.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.918
KEL CAME OUT
AND GOT IN A CAB.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.528
A FEW MINUTES LATER,
THAT DUDE CAME OUT.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.878
BY "THAT DUDE" YOU MEAN
WINSTON DELLINGER?

20:27.922 --> 20:29.010
IF THAT'S HIS NAME.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.620
HE GOT IN HIS CAR,
SO I FOLLOWED HIM.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.274
NOW WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

20:35.973 --> 20:38.802
HONESTY, I WAS THINKING
I'D FOLLOW HIM HOME.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.804
MESS HIM UP A LITTLE.
TAKE HIS MONEY AND WHATNOT.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.284
BUT NO HARM, NO FOUL, RIGHT?

20:42.328 --> 20:46.157
[snickers] WELL...

20:46.201 --> 20:48.377
WINSTON DELLINGER'S DEAD.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.249
THAT'S NOT ON ME.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.251
THE DUDE WAS DRIVING TOO FAST
AND I COULDN'T KEEP UP,

20:52.294 --> 20:54.296
SO I WENT HOME.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.214
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

20:59.258 --> 21:03.305
I THINK WHEN THE DUDE
PULLED OVER TO RELIEVE HIMSELF,

21:03.349 --> 21:05.307
YOU DROVE UP BEHIND HIM,

21:05.351 --> 21:08.005
AND YOU THOUGHT, "HEY, COOL.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.006
"WHY NOT JACK HIM RIGHT HERE?

21:09.050 --> 21:11.661
SAVE TIME, SAVE TROUBLE?"

21:11.705 --> 21:13.489
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.665
[filtered voice]
YOU CAN THINK WHAT YOU LIKE.

21:18.364 --> 21:22.324
ALL I'M SAYING IS IF YOU WILL
LET ME GO AT HIM AGAIN,

21:22.368 --> 21:24.326
COX WILL OPEN UP.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.285
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.460
WHERE ARE WE?

21:27.503 --> 21:28.939
[Rigsby] I WENT THROUGH
THE THREATS

21:28.983 --> 21:30.680
MADE AGAINST JUDGE DELLINGER.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.291
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY OF THESE
GUYS HAVE THE KIND OF PULL

21:32.334 --> 21:34.641
TO REACH OUT OF PRISON
AND KILL WINSTON.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.993
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:39.036 --> 21:42.083
UH, JUST STRETCHING MY LEGS.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.609
ANYTHING ELSE?

21:46.653 --> 21:49.960
YEAH. BALLISTICS
CAME BACK.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.354
BULLETS IN THE BODY
MATCH THE BULLETS FROM A GUN

21:52.398 --> 21:54.487
USED IN AN ARMED ROBBERY
IN OAKLAND 12 YEARS AGO.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.663
THOSE GUYS ARE IN PRISON.
GUN WAS NEVER RECOVERED.

21:56.706 --> 21:57.707
SOMEONE ELSE
MUST HAVE GOTTEN IT.

21:57.751 --> 21:58.708
I GOT SOMETHING.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.057
NINE MONTHS AGO,

22:00.101 --> 22:01.798
WINSTON WAS CHARGED WITH
VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER.

22:01.842 --> 22:04.148
D.A. SAID HE HIT AND KILLED
A WOMAN NAMED MIA DOS SANTOS

22:04.192 --> 22:05.193
WHILE DRIVING DRUNK.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.325
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

22:06.368 --> 22:07.369
THE MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE
WAS DROPPED

22:07.413 --> 22:08.457
BEFORE IT WENT TO TRIAL.

22:08.501 --> 22:09.328
HE PLEADED TO A D.U.I.,

22:09.371 --> 22:10.329
NO JAIL TIME.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.634
WELL, HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

22:11.678 --> 22:13.332
GOT ME. DOS SANTOS'
HUSBAND WAS MAD

22:13.375 --> 22:15.464
WHEN THE CHARGE GOT DROPPED.
HE MADE SOME THREATS.

22:15.508 --> 22:16.596
WHO HANDLED THE CASE?

22:16.639 --> 22:18.467
SAC P.D. DETECTIVE
NAMED NATHANIEL KIM.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.077
TALK TO HIM.
I'LL TALK TO THE HUSBAND.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.341
WHERE ARE THE RED JOHN FILES?

22:22.384 --> 22:23.559
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO
BE HERE BY NOW.

22:23.603 --> 22:24.560
YEAH, THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

22:24.604 --> 22:25.605
THE OFFICE REMODEL'S

22:25.648 --> 22:27.171
GOT THE RECORDS DEPARTMENT
BACKED UP.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.348
GREAT. WONDERFUL. TELL THEM
TO GET THEIR BUTTS IN GEAR.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.350
HEY. YOU.
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.484
[Cho] I'M LOOKING
FOR DETECTIVE NATHANIEL KIM.

22:35.528 --> 22:36.485
YOU GOT HIM.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.835
I WORK HERE
ON MY OFF DAYS.

22:38.879 --> 22:40.402
SAC P.D.'s GREAT,

22:40.446 --> 22:43.100
BUT ALIMONY AND CHILD SUPPORT
ARE A BITCH.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.191
THIS ABOUT WINSTON DELLINGER?

22:47.235 --> 22:50.369
THAT'S RIGHT.YEAH, WELL,

22:50.412 --> 22:52.066
DELLINGER KNOCKED
POOR MIA DOS SANTOS

22:52.109 --> 22:55.722
RIGHT OUT OF HER SHOES.
SHE HAD THREE KIDS.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.027
THAT'S TOUGH.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.378
WHY DID THE MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE
GET DROPPED?

22:59.421 --> 23:00.857
WE ONLY HAD
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

23:00.901 --> 23:02.685
PUTTING WINSTON AT THE SCENE.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.861
NOBODY ACTUALLY
SAW HIM HIT HER.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.950
BUT WE DID
HAVE BLOOD ON HIS CAR.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.735
SEEMED LIKE A DUNK.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.693
LAB RESULTS COME BACK,

23:10.737 --> 23:13.087
BLOOD DOESN'T BELONG
TO MIA DOS SANTOS.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.132
NO DUNK. NO CASE.

23:15.176 --> 23:16.873
WE WERE LUCKY
TO GET THE D.U.I.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.527
DID YOU DOUBLE-CHECK
THE LAB RESULTS?

23:18.571 --> 23:20.442
SURE. CAME BACK THE SAME.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.139
WINSTON'S FATHER'S A JUDGE.

23:22.183 --> 23:24.228
HE KNOWS PEOPLE
ALL THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.230
YES, HE IS,
AND, YES, HE DOES.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.537
YOU EVER CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY HE REACHED OUT,

23:28.581 --> 23:30.234
MADE SURE HIS SON
DIDN'T GO TO PRISON?

23:30.278 --> 23:31.322
SURE, I THOUGHT IT.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.063
WOULDN'T SAY IT.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.238
WHY NOT?

23:34.282 --> 23:35.936
GUY'S A FRICKIN'
TYRANNOSAURUS REX.

23:35.979 --> 23:37.067
I'M GONNA ACCUSE HIM

23:37.111 --> 23:39.243
OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
ON A HUNCH?

23:39.287 --> 23:40.636
YOU DO IT.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.769
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

23:48.601 --> 23:51.995
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT
WINSTON DELLINGER RECENTLY?

23:52.039 --> 23:53.823
I HEARD HE WAS KILLED.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.085
IS THAT RIGHT?

23:55.129 --> 23:57.261
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT,
MR. DOS SANTOS?

23:57.305 --> 23:59.916
NOT SURE.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.092
OUR LAWYERS, I THINK.

24:02.136 --> 24:05.748
YOU KNOW, WERE WERE PREPARING
A, UH, WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT

24:05.792 --> 24:07.924
AGAINST DELLINGER.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.491
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN NOW.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.841
AND HAVE YOU BEEN IN CONTACT
WITH MR. DELLINGER

24:11.885 --> 24:13.103
SINCE YOUR WIFE'S DEATH?

24:13.147 --> 24:15.932
NO. NOT RECENTLY.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.456
AFTER THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED,

24:17.499 --> 24:21.503
DIDN'T YOU SEEK HIM OUT,
THREATEN HIM SEVERAL TIMES?

24:21.547 --> 24:24.506
YEAH.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.813
I WAS REALLY ANGRY.

24:26.856 --> 24:29.772
AND I SAID SOME ANGRY THINGS.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.471
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.211
STUPID.

24:34.255 --> 24:38.128
NO. NO, IT WASN'T.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.130
THAT MAN KILLED MY DAUGHTER.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.350
AND HE LEFT HER BABIES
WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.221
AND NOTHING HAPPENS TO HIM?

24:44.265 --> 24:45.614
YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE.

24:45.658 --> 24:46.963
YOU SHOULD HAVE HURT HIM!

24:47.007 --> 24:49.357
YOU SHOULD HAVE HURT HIM
THE WAY THAT HE HURT US!

24:55.058 --> 24:58.192
[indistinct conversations]

25:05.112 --> 25:06.113
HI.

25:11.684 --> 25:12.685
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

25:12.728 --> 25:14.687
[Rigsby]
RAN CHRISTIAN DOS SANTOS.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.558
NO ARRESTS,
BUT HE'S HAD TROUBLE AT WORK

25:16.602 --> 25:19.256
SINCE HIS WIFE DIED.
ISSUES WITH CUSTOMERS.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.084
HE'S TAKING
AN ANGER MANAGEMENT COURSE.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.521
AND WHAT ABOUT THE JUDGE?

25:22.564 --> 25:23.522
CHECKED HIS BANK ACCOUNTS.

25:23.565 --> 25:24.566
NO SIGNIFICANT MONEY TRANSFERS

25:24.610 --> 25:26.350
WHEN THE MURDER CHARGE
WAS WITHDRAWN.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.527
IF HE PAID SOMEONE OFF,
THERE'S NO SIGN OF IT.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.919
STILL NO SIGN OF WHERE
WINSTON DELLINGER'S CAR

25:29.963 --> 25:31.704
HAD AN ACCIDENT
THE NIGHT HE WAS KILLED.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.228
THERE'S SOME UNIFORMS OUT THERE
LOOKING FOR DEBRIS.

25:35.316 --> 25:36.578
THAT'S IT?

25:36.622 --> 25:39.059
WELL, IT'S A HARD CASE, BOSS.

25:39.102 --> 25:41.017
LET'S START FROM THE TOP.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.453
BRING IN EVERYBODY
INVOLVED IN THE CASE.

25:42.497 --> 25:43.672
WE'LL HEAR
THEIR STORIES AGAIN.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.544
MAYBE SOMETHING
WILL SHAKE LOOSE.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.545
WILL DO.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.198
FIRST BATCH OF RED JOHN.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.200
WHERE DO YOU WANT 'EM?

25:50.244 --> 25:51.898
UH, YOU CAN
JUST LEAVE IT THERE.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.906
EAGER BEAVER, HUH?

26:11.918 --> 26:12.875
MR. JANE,

26:12.919 --> 26:14.616
BEFORE YOU GET INTO THAT,

26:14.660 --> 26:17.706
I WANTED TO ASK A FAVOR.

26:17.750 --> 26:23.930
I NEED YOUR HELP.

26:28.674 --> 26:31.633
[Lisbon] OKAY. EVERYBODY
INVOLVED IN THE DELLINGER MURDER

26:31.677 --> 26:32.678
IS IN THAT ROOM.

26:32.721 --> 26:35.419
ONE OF THEM
IS VERY LIKELY LYING.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.334
ONE OF THEM IS VERY LIKELY
THE MURDERER.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.466
WOW.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.599
WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO
IS GO IN THERE,

26:40.642 --> 26:42.296
TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OF THEM,

26:42.339 --> 26:43.950
AND TELL ME
IF YOU CAN SPOT THE LIAR.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.647
ME?

26:45.691 --> 26:47.431
YOU SEEM TO HAVE A GIFT.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.912
I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT A PSYCHIC.

26:49.956 --> 26:52.436
I'M A CHARLATAN.
YOU HEAR ME?

26:52.480 --> 26:53.699
I-I-I'M A FRAUD.

26:53.742 --> 26:54.743
I BELIEVE YOU.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.832
BUT WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S A GIFT.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.617
I FIGURE, WHY NOT USE IT?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.623
[Patrick] I CAN'T.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.277
WE'RE KIND OF
AT A STANDSTILL HERE.

27:07.321 --> 27:08.322
COME ON.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.111
HELLO, EVERYBODY.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.853
UM, THIS IS PATRICK JANE.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.508
HE'S A CONSULTANT
WITH THE CBI.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.118
BEFORE WE START
THE INTERVIEWS,

27:22.162 --> 27:24.294
HE'S GONNA... WE'LL SEE
WHAT HE'S GONNA DO.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.340
MR. JANE?

27:35.741 --> 27:37.481
HI, FOLKS.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.570
QUICK QUESTION--WHICH ONE OF YOU
KILLED WINSTON DELLINGER?

27:39.614 --> 27:41.660
OH, COME ON.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.WHAT?!

27:41.703 --> 27:44.488
I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
AND LISTEN TO THIS.IS HE SERIOUS?

27:44.532 --> 27:47.535
EVERYBODY JUST CALM DOWN,
PLEASE.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.145
THAT WAS WORTH A TRY.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.670
UH, AGENTS CHO AND RIGSBY WILL
PROCEED WITH THE INTERVIEWS.

27:51.713 --> 27:52.975
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.498
[Cho] JUDGE, IF YOU'LL
COME WITH ME.

27:54.542 --> 27:55.499
[lowered voice]
UH, WAIT A MINUTE.

27:55.543 --> 27:56.675
I THINK I KNOW WHO DID IT.

27:56.718 --> 27:57.980
YOU SURE?PRETTY SURE.

27:58.024 --> 28:01.897
IF EVERYBODY COULD JUST
PLEASE SIT BACK DOWN.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.204
MY APOLOGIES. PLEASE.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.906
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE?

28:10.950 --> 28:14.518
UH, 70%.

28:14.562 --> 28:17.391
YOU HAVE TAROT CARDS?

28:17.434 --> 28:19.175
TAROT CARDS?NO.

28:19.219 --> 28:22.744
UH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
UM, I-I'M SORRY

28:22.788 --> 28:26.705
FOR, UH, FOR WASTING
YOUR TIME. IF, UH...

28:26.748 --> 28:28.750
I'VE HAD MORE
THAN ENOUGH OF THIS.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.839
AGENT LISBON, REALLY?

28:30.883 --> 28:32.754
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

28:32.798 --> 28:33.755
TELL HIM, JUDGE.

28:33.799 --> 28:34.887
JUST ONE MOMENT MORE.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.410
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANNA SHOW YOU.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.760
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT
FIND AMAZING.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.546
I USED TO BE A PSYCHIC.

28:42.590 --> 28:45.724
I USED TO READ MINDS, TALK TO
DEAD PEOPLE. ONLY I DIDN'T.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.726
OF COURSE I DIDN'T,
'CAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING

28:47.769 --> 28:51.251
AS PSYCHICS OR MEDIUMS,
OR AT LEAST I'VE NEVER MET ONE.

28:51.294 --> 28:53.644
PSYCHIC POWERS
ARE JUST TRICKS.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.472
THEY'RE MIND GAMES.
IT'S OBSERVATION.

28:55.516 --> 28:58.388
BUT IT WORKS.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.216
THERE'S A KILLER
IN THIS ROOM,

29:00.260 --> 29:02.871
AND I'M GONNA USE
PSEUDO-PSYCHIC POWERS

29:02.915 --> 29:06.396
TO PERSUADE THAT KILLER
TO CONFESS.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.658
THIS IS BULL.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.924
SHORTCUT METHOD--THE FIRST
PERSON TO LEAVE DID IT.

29:20.193 --> 29:24.458
NOW LIKE I SAY, THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS PSYCHICS.

29:24.501 --> 29:27.809
LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.420
BUT THE HUMAN MIND

29:30.464 --> 29:32.771
IS AMAZINGLY POWERFUL.

29:32.814 --> 29:38.820
IT CAN DO THINGS FOR REAL
THAT SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE MAGIC.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.256
AND I WANNA SHOW YOU.

29:40.300 --> 29:45.914
NOW, NORMALLY, I WOULD USE
TAROT CARDS FOR THIS.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.961
BUT, UH, IN THIS CASE,
THESE WILL HAVE TO DO,

29:49.004 --> 29:52.921
AS LONG AS YOU'RE ALL WILLING
TO USE A LITTLE IMAGINATION.

29:52.965 --> 29:54.488
[pen scratching]

29:54.531 --> 29:55.881
BEAR WITH ME.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.843
AGENT LISBON,
IF YOU COULD, UH,

30:01.887 --> 30:04.803
MIX THOSE CARDS
UP THOROUGHLY, PLEASE.

30:04.846 --> 30:05.804
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.026
TAKE 'EM.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.071
THANK YOU.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.769
NOW...

30:17.903 --> 30:21.167
I WOULD LIKE YOU,
WITHOUT LOOKING,

30:21.210 --> 30:24.823
TO CHOOSE A CARD,
FACE-DOWN, BUT FIRST--

30:24.866 --> 30:26.650
AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT--

30:26.694 --> 30:28.217
BEFORE YOU TAKE THE CARD,

30:28.261 --> 30:29.871
I'D LIKE YOU TO CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK

30:29.915 --> 30:31.699
ABOUT THE LAST SCARY DREAM
YOU HAD.

30:31.742 --> 30:32.961
[scoffs]

30:33.005 --> 30:35.137
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
YOU WOKE UP

30:35.181 --> 30:37.400
SHIVERING WITH FEAR.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.754
GOT IT? GOOD.

30:43.798 --> 30:46.453
THANK YOU. OPEN YOUR EYES.

30:49.021 --> 30:49.891
TAKE A CARD.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.851
KEEP IT FACE-DOWN.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.722
KEEP YOUR HAND
ON TOP OF IT.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.344
THANK YOU.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.520
NOW HERE'S THE THING--

31:10.564 --> 31:13.175
YOU THINK YOU JUST
MADE A RANDOM PICK.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.874
WHERE, IN FACT,
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND

31:15.917 --> 31:17.876
MADE A VERY MEANINGFUL CHOICE.

31:17.919 --> 31:21.053
AND THIS IS HOW
THE KILLER WILL BE REVEALED.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.579
MRS. RECINOS,

31:25.622 --> 31:27.537
YOU DREAMT THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS FALLING

31:27.581 --> 31:29.278
INTO A VERY DARK PLACE,

31:29.322 --> 31:31.193
AND YOU COULDN'T STOP HER.

31:31.237 --> 31:32.891
YOU CALLED OUT
THAT YOU LOVED HER,

31:32.934 --> 31:34.196
BUT SHE COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.894
YES.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.940
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU CHOSE THE LOVERS.

31:38.984 --> 31:43.292
[gasps and speaks Spanish]

31:47.949 --> 31:52.040
JUDGE DELLINGER,
YOU DREAMT OF DEATH.

31:52.084 --> 31:55.000
AND YOU CHOSE DEATH.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.876
KELLY, YOU CAN'T SHAKE
THE IDEA

32:01.920 --> 32:04.923
THAT YOU'LL
NEVER FIND TRUE LOVE.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.926
AND YOU PICKED THE FOOL.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.059
[gasps]

32:11.103 --> 32:13.757
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

32:13.801 --> 32:15.977
MR. KIM.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.979
YOU HAVE
A LOT OF SCARY DREAMS.

32:19.546 --> 32:22.070
BUT YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THEM.

32:22.114 --> 32:25.944
HOWEVER, YOU'RE A COP.

32:25.987 --> 32:30.949
SO YOU THINK THE RULES
DON'T APPLY TO YOU.

32:30.992 --> 32:34.387
AND YOU CHOSE THE MAGICIAN.

32:38.347 --> 32:39.305
NEAT TRICK.

32:39.348 --> 32:40.959
YES, JUST A TRICK.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.613
MR. DOS SANTOS, YOU DREAM
OF BEING TRAPPED.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.354
CAGED LIKE AN ANIMAL.

32:45.398 --> 32:50.620
AND YOU DREAM OF A TERRIBLE,
VIOLENT ESCAPE.

32:50.664 --> 32:53.188
YOU PICKED THE DEVIL.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.409
NONE OF THAT'S TRUE.

32:56.452 --> 32:59.803
AND, MR. COX.

32:59.847 --> 33:02.023
YOU CONSTANTLY DREAM
OF ALL THE PEOPLE YOU'VE HURT

33:02.067 --> 33:04.112
COMING BACK TO SEEK REVENGE.

33:04.156 --> 33:06.462
AND GUESS WHAT?

33:06.506 --> 33:09.465
THEY HAVE THE SAME DREAM.

33:09.509 --> 33:12.729
YOU CHOSE THE HANGED MAN.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.913
UH, ACTUALLY
THAT'S NOT... RIGHT.

33:22.957 --> 33:27.222
UH, MR. KIM
HAD THAT CARD.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.702
[sets card on table]

33:31.748 --> 33:32.749
[Patrick] AH.

33:37.798 --> 33:38.799
UH-HUH.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.718
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

33:46.067 --> 33:47.721
IT MEANS YOU KILLED
WINSTON DELLINGER.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.074
YEAH, RIGHT.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.945
NO. NO BREAK.
YOU DID IT.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.165
THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
NEVER LIES.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.167
YOUR GUILT IS WRITTEN
ON THAT CARD...

33:59.211 --> 34:01.996
AND WRITTEN ALL OVER
YOUR FACE.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.520
NO. NO, I-I DIDN'T. COME ON.
IT'S A CARD TRICK.

34:04.564 --> 34:07.610
YES, IT WAS, BUT WHEN I SAID
I COULD USE YOUR CHOICE OF CARD

34:07.654 --> 34:09.351
TO REVEAL THE KILLER,

34:09.395 --> 34:12.093
YOU LOOKED A LITTLE WORRIED.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.704
FOR A SPLIT SECOND.
JUST YOU.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.054
AND THEN YOU LOOKED RELIEVED

34:16.097 --> 34:17.620
WHEN I COULDN'T READ
YOUR DREAM.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.057
AND THEN WHEN YOU SAW
THE HANGED MAN,

34:19.100 --> 34:21.233
THE BLOOD DRAINED
FROM YOUR FACE.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.452
NO. NO, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

34:23.496 --> 34:24.888
EVERYONE CAN SEE
YOUR GUILT.

34:24.932 --> 34:27.065
BUT WHAT I CAN'T SEE
IS YOUR MOTIVE.

34:27.108 --> 34:29.719
WHY, NATHANIEL?

34:29.763 --> 34:30.807
WHY DID YOU KILL HIM?

34:33.288 --> 34:35.029
LOOK AT ME.

34:37.466 --> 34:41.122
WHY, NATHANIEL?

34:41.166 --> 34:43.820
YOU SEEM LIKE A GOOD PERSON.

34:43.864 --> 34:47.389
YOU COME FROM GOOD PEOPLE.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.435
WHY'D YOU KILL HIM?

34:57.747 --> 34:59.401
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.971
THAT'S YOUR MAN, AGENT LISBON.

35:05.320 --> 35:12.980
THAT'S YOUR MAN.

35:20.640 --> 35:24.948
YOU HAD THE EVIDENCE
AGAINST WINSTON DELLINGER.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.167
I WENT TO THE LAB.

35:26.211 --> 35:28.474
I SWAPPED THE BLOOD SAMPLE
FROM HIS FENDER

35:28.517 --> 35:30.040
FOR ANOTHER SAMPLE.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.041
WHY'D YOU DO IT?

35:31.085 --> 35:33.957
I'M A SILENT PARTNER
IN THE BAR.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.785
EVERYTHING I GOT
IS IN THAT PLACE.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.352
LAST YEAR, WE GOT SUED.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.137
GUY GOT BEAT UP
IN A FIGHT.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.660
AND THE BAR LOST THE SUIT?

35:40.703 --> 35:43.445
I WAS GONNA LOSE
EVERY PENNY I HAD.

35:43.489 --> 35:46.144
BUT WHEN I CAUGHT
THE DELLINGER CASE,

35:46.187 --> 35:47.667
I FOUND OUT HIS FATHER

35:47.710 --> 35:49.277
WOULD HEAR THE APPEAL
OF THE LAWSUIT.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.627
THE JUDGE MUST HAVE BEEN SCARED
ABOUT HIS SON GOING TO PRISON?

35:51.671 --> 35:53.803
YEAH. TERRIFIED.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.762
I MEAN, HE WAS SURE
THE KID WOULD BE KILLED,

35:55.805 --> 35:57.981
'CAUSE OF ALL THE GUYS
HE PUT AWAY.

35:58.025 --> 36:01.246
SO I WENT TO THE JUDGE
AND MADE A DEAL.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.335
HE'D RULE IN THE BAR'S FAVOR,

36:03.378 --> 36:05.293
I'D HIDE THE EVIDENCE
AGAINST WINSTON.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.469
HOW DID THAT
GET WINSTON KILLED?

36:07.513 --> 36:10.559
THAT NIGHT,
I'M IN BED, ASLEEP.

36:10.603 --> 36:13.693
AND WINSTON CALLS ME
IN A DRUNKEN PANIC.

36:13.736 --> 36:18.567
HE SAYS HE WAS DRIVING
AND HIT SOMEBODY... AGAIN.

36:18.611 --> 36:21.701
I SAID HE SHOULD
MAN UP AND CALL THE COPS.

36:21.744 --> 36:25.183
HE SAYS IF I DON'T HELP HIM,

36:25.226 --> 36:28.316
HE'LL TELL ABOUT THE DEAL
I MADE WITH HIS FATHER.

36:28.360 --> 36:32.190
I MEAN, HE WAS GOING
TO DESTROY MY CAREER.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.889
SO I GO OUT
TO THE PLACE TO MEET HIM.

36:35.932 --> 36:39.327
LOOK, I HIT HIM RIGHT THERE.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.199
OH, MY CAR.

36:41.242 --> 36:44.202
LOOK, HE MUST HAVE CRAWLED
OFF THE ROAD OR SOME--

36:45.551 --> 36:47.335
WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE,
HELP ME!

36:47.379 --> 36:49.685
YOU OWE ME!
MY DAD SAVED YOUR ASS!

36:49.729 --> 36:52.035
NOW DO SOMETHING!

36:52.079 --> 36:54.212
HE'S FREAKING OUT. I MEAN,
HE CAN'T FIND THE BODY.

36:54.255 --> 36:57.345
HE THINKS MAYBE
WHOEVER HE HIT

36:57.389 --> 36:59.956
IS STILL ALIVE
AND CRAWLED AWAY.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.221
I MEAN... HE WAS
OUT OF CONTROL.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.353
IT'S GOTTA BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

37:05.397 --> 37:08.138
AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.357
IT'S GOTTA BE HERE.

37:09.401 --> 37:12.273
IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS FOOL,

37:12.317 --> 37:14.623
RIGHT NOW...

37:14.667 --> 37:16.146
WINSTON.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.887
HE'S GONNA DOG ME
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

37:17.931 --> 37:18.932
SORRY.

37:24.329 --> 37:28.376
YOU, UH, YOU EVER
FIND THE GUY HE HIT?

37:28.420 --> 37:30.552
MUST BE STILL OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE.

37:30.596 --> 37:31.597
NO.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.434
BUT UNIFORMS FOUND A DEER
THAT HAD BEEN HIT BY A CAR

37:42.477 --> 37:45.263
A LITTLE WAYS OFF THE ROAD.

37:45.306 --> 37:46.829
MUST HAVE BEEN TOO DRUNK
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.266
A DEER?

37:49.441 --> 37:51.312
HE...

37:51.356 --> 37:54.315
[door opens]HE HIT A... A DEER?

37:54.359 --> 37:56.535
[door closes]

37:56.578 --> 37:59.189
[scoffs] THAT'S PERFECT.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.190
[bell dings]

38:00.234 --> 38:02.497
[gate scrapes, clicks]

38:07.328 --> 38:09.635
SO MINELLI REALLY HIRED
THIS JANE GUY?

38:09.678 --> 38:11.332
WELL, HE EXPOSED
A CORRUPT COP,

38:11.376 --> 38:12.377
DETHRONED A JUDGE.

38:12.420 --> 38:15.423
THOSE ARE ALL
MAJOR POINTS FOR US.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.991
AS FAR AS MINELLI'S CONCERNED,
HE'S A HERO.

38:18.034 --> 38:20.123
AND, UH...

38:20.167 --> 38:21.777
DOES HANNIGAN
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

38:21.821 --> 38:23.518
YEAH. HE DOESN'T WANT
TO WORK WITH JANE,

38:23.562 --> 38:26.216
SO HE'S TRANSFERRING
TO ANOTHER UNIT.

38:26.260 --> 38:27.827
ANY IDEA WHO'S GONNA
REPLACE HANNIGAN?

38:27.870 --> 38:29.132
DON'T KNOW YET.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.482
THERE'S A NEW CLASS
OF TRAINEES COMING UP.

38:30.525 --> 38:31.831
MAYBE WE'LL GET ONE OF THEM.

38:31.874 --> 38:33.572
FILES ARE RIGHT THERE
IF YOU WANNA TAKE A LOOK.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.535
LIKE THIS ONE.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.234
SHE'S CUTE.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.457
ONE LAST TIME--

38:49.501 --> 38:51.372
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA DO THIS?

38:51.416 --> 38:53.331
YES, I AM.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.245
OKAY. I TRIED.

38:55.289 --> 38:57.030
YOU DID.

39:00.381 --> 39:01.687
THANK YOU.

39:10.870 --> 39:12.698
SHALL WE GO?

39:19.618 --> 39:21.097
[clicks switch]

39:21.141 --> 39:23.012
HERE YOU GO.

39:23.056 --> 39:24.405
I'M GOING HOME.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.929
IF YOU NEED ME TO EXPLAIN
ANYTHING, GIVE ME A CALL.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.457
[phone rings]

40:16.501 --> 40:17.458
YES?

40:17.502 --> 40:19.286
[woman] Virgil Minelli?

40:19.329 --> 40:22.071
YES. WHO'S THIS?

40:22.115 --> 40:24.465
ALEXA SHULTZ, FBI.

40:24.509 --> 40:27.294
WE MET AT THE FORENSICS
CONFERENCE IN ROANOKE.

40:27.337 --> 40:30.993
DIRECTOR SHULTZ. WHAT
A PLEASURE TO HEAR FROM YOU.

40:31.037 --> 40:33.605
I UNDERSTAND THE CBI
HAS HIRED A NEW CONSULTANT,

40:33.648 --> 40:36.259
A MAN NAMED PATRICK JANE?

40:36.303 --> 40:37.304
Yes.

40:37.347 --> 40:38.784
I'M SURPRISED YOU KNOW.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.613
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU FOLLOWED
OUR HIRING THAT CLOSELY.

40:41.656 --> 40:44.572
MR. JANE IS CONNECTED
TO A CASE WE'RE INTERESTED IN.

40:44.616 --> 40:47.009
THE SERIAL KILLER
KNOWN AS RED JOHN.

40:47.053 --> 40:50.448
I'm, um, calling
to ask a favor.

40:50.491 --> 40:52.493
WHAT'S THAT?

40:52.537 --> 40:57.455
I WOULD APPRECIATE UPDATES
ON THE RED JOHN CASE.

40:57.498 --> 41:00.240
That way, when my boss
asks me what's going on,

41:00.283 --> 41:02.068
I have something
to tell him.

41:02.111 --> 41:05.158
TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, ALEXA,

41:05.201 --> 41:06.986
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

41:07.029 --> 41:08.770
What's in it for me?

41:08.814 --> 41:11.381
IT'S USEFUL TO HAVE A FRIEND
IN THE FBI, ISN'T IT?

41:11.425 --> 41:13.514
And I'm a good friend.

41:13.558 --> 41:19.215
WELL, I'M A GREAT BELIEVER
IN INTER-AGENCY COOPERATION.

41:19.259 --> 41:22.305
I don't see why
we couldn't engage in some.

41:22.349 --> 41:25.526
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT, VIRGIL.

41:25.570 --> 41:27.006
OH, BY THE WAY,

41:27.049 --> 41:30.531
ONE THING YOU MIGHT WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT PATRICK JANE--

41:30.575 --> 41:33.534
YOU KNOW HOW HE'S BEEN
OUT OF SIGHT IN THE PAST YEAR?

41:33.578 --> 41:35.493
You know where he's been?

41:35.536 --> 41:36.537
NO.

41:36.581 --> 41:39.366
AN INSANE ASYLUM.

41:39.409 --> 41:40.410
GOOD LUCK.

41:46.199 --> 41:47.374
DONE.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.030
THANK YOU.

41:54.424 --> 41:55.469
[man] GOOD MORNING.

42:22.627 --> 42:25.455
HEY, BOSS.SHH.

42:25.499 --> 42:27.675
[lowered voice]
WE CAUGHT ONE. FRESNO.

42:27.719 --> 42:29.547
[lowered voice] GET RIGSBY.
LET'S LEAVE BEFORE TRAFFIC.

42:29.590 --> 42:30.548
OKAY.
