00:59.184 --> 01:00.852
Careful... put it down there.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.064
Good boys. Did anyone follow you?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.026
Stop! Hands up!

01:16.743 --> 01:17.786
Stop!

01:44.270 --> 01:45.522
Well...

01:45.605 --> 01:47.357
"baker boy"...

01:49.609 --> 01:52.237
Everyone who meets me...

01:54.614 --> 01:55.657
talks.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.871
Do you know why?

02:04.415 --> 02:05.291
I am...

02:06.376 --> 02:09.337
prepared to go the extra mile.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.425
The sensible ones...

02:15.051 --> 02:16.302
they talk right away.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.346
But the stupid ones...

02:21.182 --> 02:22.308
they suffer...

02:23.726 --> 02:24.811
for nothing.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.148
Now...

02:29.899 --> 02:31.943
are you going to be sensible...

02:32.735 --> 02:33.778
or stupid?

02:37.365 --> 02:38.992
Please... please...

02:39.534 --> 02:42.996
-I'm not the one you beg to.
-I'll talk!

02:50.628 --> 02:51.921
Relax, man! Relax...

02:54.716 --> 02:56.134
Take it easy.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.023
Well?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.323
Spit it out.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.248
His name is Rashid Khalid Al Nuaimi.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.420
His father is Nuaimi.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.384
Avi...

09:36.033 --> 09:38.077
Go... Get in there...

09:38.160 --> 09:40.329
Come on! You're making me late!

09:40.413 --> 09:42.081
Get in! Go on!

10:05.896 --> 10:10.735
<i>Italy is just across</i>
<i>the Mediterranean from Algeria.</i>

10:11.944 --> 10:13.946
<i>Malik, there you are.</i>

10:14.655 --> 10:16.699
Yes. And I'm sorry I was late.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.118
I was bringing the goats in
to be milked, and one got away.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.745
<i>That's okay.</i>

10:20.828 --> 10:22.163
But that's not the worst part...

10:22.622 --> 10:24.624
This goat, he was taken by a lion!

10:26.626 --> 10:28.377
<i>A lion? Really?</i>

10:29.086 --> 10:30.546
There are no lions here.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.341
Malik is always telling stories.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.135
There was a lion, the most
ferocious one I've seen.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.138
But don't worry, Mademoiselle,
I had my stick...

10:39.221 --> 10:41.682
and chased him away,
and saved my goat.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.312
Last week, he saw a spaceship.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.943
Hey... Stay awake!

19:30.210 --> 19:32.880
You're unredeemable.
That's what you think.

19:34.548 --> 19:38.427
So you project your shame onto God.

19:43.599 --> 19:48.103
Our sins have a way of punishing us
when we ignore them.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.357
That boy.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.696
He'll be the last thing
you see before you die.

22:12.539 --> 22:13.665
Please!

22:17.377 --> 22:18.628
Please...

22:19.296 --> 22:20.672
Please. I'm sorry.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.342
What are you sorry for?

22:24.343 --> 22:25.427
For everything.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.221
Everything?

22:28.305 --> 22:29.973
You're sorry for everything?

22:30.807 --> 22:33.477
You're sorry
for all the wrong in the world?

22:34.936 --> 22:36.188
No... no.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.439
I'm sorry for what I did.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.901
I don't care what you did.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.742
I care who you are.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.286
I told you my name.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.623
Yes.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.541
I know your father.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.504
He's had a lot to do with my life.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.464
He shaped me.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.716
He gave me my conviction.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.762
He's had more influence over me
than any other person.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.598
He's killed many people...

23:13.141 --> 23:14.684
and boasted about it.

23:16.937 --> 23:17.938
Including...

23:19.231 --> 23:20.232
my mother.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.417
You weren't even born...

23:40.085 --> 23:42.295
but you've inherited his sin.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.217
No, no! Please!

23:47.968 --> 23:49.469
<i>I'm only 14!</i>

23:50.095 --> 23:51.721
My mother doesn't even know where I am.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.807
Please! Her heart will be broken!

23:54.933 --> 23:56.852
I bear witness that there is
no God but Allah...

23:56.935 --> 23:59.271
<i>and Muhammad is his messenger!</i>

24:05.861 --> 24:06.778
I'm sorry.

28:19.864 --> 28:23.993
<i>His brother,</i>
<i>Adar Golshiri, confirmed the report...</i>

28:24.077 --> 28:27.580
<i>speaking to the press</i>
<i>in Tehran this morning...</i>

28:27.831 --> 28:29.916
<i>You know I'm doing a trick...</i>

28:30.875 --> 28:33.712
<i>but you're still amazed when I do it.</i>

28:33.795 --> 28:35.797
<i>At worst you're entertained...</i>

28:37.132 --> 28:39.759
<i>you want to figure out how I did it.</i>

28:40.677 --> 28:45.974
<i>But the best magicians make you</i>
<i>a part of it, they bring you in.</i>

36:15.006 --> 36:16.507
Here ... drink.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.596
How did he do it?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.060
Who are you?

36:29.312 --> 36:30.188
Malik.

36:31.105 --> 36:32.315
You were dead.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.196
What?

36:38.279 --> 36:40.448
You were dead. He raised you.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.575
The man...

36:43.659 --> 36:44.577
...he is magic.

36:45.953 --> 36:49.165
He put his hand on your heart
and you began to breathe.

36:49.582 --> 36:50.917
What are you talking about?

36:51.959 --> 36:53.669
You and that other man there...

37:00.426 --> 37:01.719
You were both dead.

37:02.261 --> 37:03.596
Your skin was gray.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.389
You had flies crawling in your mouth...

37:05.723 --> 37:06.724
and then he touched you...

37:06.807 --> 37:08.351
and you came back.
