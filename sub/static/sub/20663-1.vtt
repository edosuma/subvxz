00:27.542 --> 00:33.126
SMALL TOWN KILLERS

00:46.584 --> 00:47.709
Well...

00:47.834 --> 00:50.751
So, all you think about is sex?

00:50.876 --> 00:53.376
His head is bursting with sex thoughts.

00:53.501 --> 00:58.876
Gritt, let's let lb answer for himself.
I think lb is able to.

00:59.001 --> 01:03.709
Well, answer for yourself, lb. Tell
Aniannani that your head is full of sex.

01:03.834 --> 01:08.376
No, no, I do sometimes have
other thoughts in my head.

01:08.501 --> 01:11.542
If I ask him to water the plants,
he gets a hard-on.

01:11.667 --> 01:15.126
- Oh?
- He can't even reach the window sill.

01:15.251 --> 01:17.542
Oh my.

01:17.667 --> 01:20.876
It's only because
I think she's so gorgeous.

01:21.001 --> 01:25.667
Well, that's great, Gritt.
Isn't it?

01:25.792 --> 01:30.709
You have a man who wants you.
I'm sure many women would envy you that.

01:30.834 --> 01:34.376
Sure, but does everything have
to be about sex all the time?

01:34.501 --> 01:37.376
The public domain is crammed with sex.

01:37.501 --> 01:40.209
- You can't even open a magazine.
- No...

01:40.334 --> 01:44.709
If I go online to find a good offer,
I get a picture of a wiener.

01:45.834 --> 01:46.917
Yuckie.

01:47.042 --> 01:50.292
And if you can't even
go to your own house -

01:50.417 --> 01:54.042
- and lie down in your own bed without
being confronted with sex there, too...

01:54.167 --> 01:57.792
Where the devil will it end?

01:58.501 --> 02:02.626
Hi there, you hot piece of ass.

02:02.751 --> 02:05.292
Hi.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.667
So, who are you then?

02:07.792 --> 02:10.667
Oh, I'm just Ingrid's ass.

02:10.792 --> 02:12.584
Oh, I see.

02:12.709 --> 02:16.792
How would you like me to grope you?

02:16.917 --> 02:18.459
Well, go ahead.

02:18.584 --> 02:23.917
Stop talking to my butt as if
it's a pet. You'll confuse Little Per.

02:24.042 --> 02:27.042
You're making me nervous.
It's sick, Edward.

02:27.167 --> 02:29.376
Why do you have to rehearse
that fancy-pants dance every night?

02:29.501 --> 02:33.084
Fancy-pants dance?
Salsa is an art form.

02:33.209 --> 02:37.459
But then again, your head isn't filled
with art but stone wool, more like it.

02:37.584 --> 02:41.792
When was the last time we fucked?
When was it?

02:41.917 --> 02:46.001
- Do you know your Danish history?
- Sure. I live with the Grauballe Man.

02:46.084 --> 02:49.917
- That bog body gets more sex than me.
- Call lb.

02:50.042 --> 02:54.626
- I'm not in the mood for sex with lb.
- Don't you have to go to work?

02:54.751 --> 02:58.126
You and lb and your wieners.

02:58.251 --> 03:01.834
Maybe they'll let you
have a go after work.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.917
Don't be embarrassed about being a man.

04:23.042 --> 04:26.834
But I think about sex all the time.

04:29.042 --> 04:31.626
It's because you never get laid.

04:31.751 --> 04:35.251
If you did, you wouldn't
think about it all the time.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.501
It's like breathing.

04:36.626 --> 04:40.792
If you were sitting in a submarine
running out of oxygen -

04:40.917 --> 04:43.001
- you'd think about breathing
all the time.

04:43.126 --> 04:46.542
Women don't understand
that sex is our way of breathing.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.001
Our dick is kinda like our third lung.

04:50.417 --> 04:54.251
Gritt still wants to have kids,
but I'm not keen on it.

04:54.376 --> 04:58.501
Of course not. They climb into bed
and lie in the crack.

04:58.626 --> 05:04.334
Kids are crap.
There's no upside to it. None at all.

05:04.459 --> 05:07.459
There's nothing doing with Ingrid.
She doesn't want to have sex.

05:07.584 --> 05:10.417
Even if I promise
it'll only take 15 seconds.

05:10.542 --> 05:14.792
So, problems at home?

05:14.917 --> 05:18.501
The bricks are on back order,
Mrs. Hansen. It's a load of bull.

05:18.626 --> 05:21.251
But aren't bricks always available?

05:21.376 --> 05:25.417
Bricks aren't just bricks,
as I've told you once before.

05:25.542 --> 05:30.917
- I just need a new wall.
- Right, and Rome was built in a day.

05:31.042 --> 05:35.542
I clean forgot.
Thanks for reminding me, Mrs. Hansen.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.126
Thanks a lot.

05:37.251 --> 05:40.126
There are two kinds of customers.

05:40.251 --> 05:43.042
With one kind,
you're only in it for the cool cash.

05:43.167 --> 05:46.251
With the other kind, like you,
you put your heart into it.

05:46.376 --> 05:49.834
- And finish the job!
- Yes, absolutely.

05:50.001 --> 05:53.584
Van Gogh didn't paint for the money.
He painted with his heart.

05:53.709 --> 05:57.876
Are you quite sure
you've got time for this?

05:59.792 --> 06:02.001
Hey, there's our radio and stuff.

06:02.084 --> 06:05.917
We wouldn't leave our radio and stuff
here if we weren't working here.

06:06.042 --> 06:09.417
lb has been on the phone all morning
about those bricks.

06:09.542 --> 06:13.001
We almost gave up on you,
but then, your radio and stuff are here.

06:13.834 --> 06:17.459
- Honestly, have you got time for this?
- No...

06:17.584 --> 06:20.042
- Look, Steen.
- Henrik.

06:20.167 --> 06:24.917
There are two kinds of customers. With
one kind, you're in it for the cash.

06:25.042 --> 06:27.876
- With the other, you put this into it.
- Your heart.

06:28.001 --> 06:30.251
That's what you said a month ago.

06:36.042 --> 06:40.626
I thought you wanted the bill dealt with
under the table.

06:44.001 --> 06:48.834
Didn't they want the bill dealt with
under the table? I thought so.

06:49.001 --> 06:55.126
But, Steen,
we'll do it by the book. No worries.

06:55.251 --> 06:59.167
It's gonna cost you, but if you want
to upgrade to Business Class -

06:59.292 --> 07:03.417
- we'll do it. We can upgrade Steen
and Pernille to Business Class, right?

07:03.542 --> 07:09.917
Sure. You get to sit up front with
champagne and silverware everywhere.

07:10.042 --> 07:13.501
No, no, that's not
what we want, right, Henrik?

07:13.626 --> 07:16.084
No, no.

07:16.209 --> 07:21.084
- We'll just wait.
- Or we can wait. Whatever you want.

07:22.834 --> 07:27.001
We've filled the book for the next six
months. How many jobs are undeclared?

07:27.126 --> 07:29.542
Just about half a million kroner.

07:33.709 --> 07:37.584
Ingrid is faking it the other way round.

07:37.709 --> 07:41.001
- The few times I get to sneak it in.
- The other way round?

07:41.126 --> 07:46.209
She pretends not to come, but she does.
I can tell that she's coming, lb.

07:46.334 --> 07:50.251
She stuffs her hand in her mouth
and thinks I don't notice.

07:53.042 --> 07:57.626
But she's coming alright.
She's coming hard.

07:57.751 --> 08:01.042
- But why does she do that?
- So I won't see I give her pleasure.

08:01.167 --> 08:03.751
Oh no, Heinz.

08:07.876 --> 08:11.042
Hey there, Laurel and Hardy.
Hans and Fritz.

08:11.167 --> 08:14.501
Or what are the names of
the two guys from Dumb and Dumber?

08:14.626 --> 08:19.001
- Harry and Lloyd.
- Exactly. How's life, Harry and Lloyd?

08:19.084 --> 08:23.709
Careful or you might shoot yourself
in the thigh with that thing.

08:23.834 --> 08:27.751
This thing...
is a Korth Combat .357 Magnum.

08:27.876 --> 08:31.501
It goes by another name, too.
"Responsibility".

08:31.626 --> 08:34.083
The responsibility for making sure
citizens can sleep at night.

08:34.208 --> 08:37.751
- Do you tuck in?
- Terrorists don't sleep at night.

08:37.876 --> 08:40.458
Some people have to be vigilant, 24-7.

08:40.583 --> 08:44.751
You may very well ask:
What's gonna happen in Nibe?

08:45.626 --> 08:50.459
We go to work, watch X Factor, drive
scummy cars and eat humid sandwiches.

08:50.584 --> 08:53.001
Peace and quiet everywhere.

08:53.126 --> 08:55.459
But that's just
what they want us to believe.

08:55.584 --> 08:58.917
Nibe doesn't even show up
on Google Earth.

08:59.042 --> 09:03.209
It's one big grey pixel. The little
yellow man can't move an inch.

09:04.084 --> 09:08.834
Anyway, what would the terrorists
blow up? The local bus stop?

09:12.126 --> 09:16.751
- What do you need all those radios for?
- You can learn a lot from the radio.

09:16.876 --> 09:20.084
I just checked up on your tax returns.

09:20.209 --> 09:25.001
Your little juggernaut of a company
sure rakes in money.

09:25.084 --> 09:28.001
- 125,000 kroner a year.
- That much?

09:28.126 --> 09:30.459
Not bad.

09:30.584 --> 09:33.084
You're frigging pathetic.

09:33.209 --> 09:37.001
Your wives drive Mercedes
and dance in high heels with Malte -

09:37.126 --> 09:41.042
- while you sit here looking like a
couple of early retirees from Bulgaria.

09:41.167 --> 09:45.126
Dumb and Dumber.
Don't make me laugh.

09:50.209 --> 09:53.792
Your right tail light is out.
Have a nice day.

09:55.751 --> 09:59.792
Come here, my angels.
Come.

10:00.709 --> 10:06.584
We may be in a small town,
but we don't think small -

10:06.709 --> 10:10.167
- because salsa is in-ter-na-tio-nal.

10:10.292 --> 10:14.584
Understand? When we shake
our booties to salsa in Nibe -

10:14.709 --> 10:18.667
- they shake their booties
to salsa in Cuba or Rio -

10:18.792 --> 10:21.001
- in exactly the same way.

10:21.126 --> 10:25.251
We're one big family.
One big pulse -

10:25.376 --> 10:29.084
- beating away inside of us -

10:29.209 --> 10:32.417
- men and women.

10:33.209 --> 10:37.917
We started this class
when fate brought me to Nibe.

10:38.042 --> 10:44.292
And I saw all these withered Danes
under the grey sky.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.209
Then something happened.

10:47.334 --> 10:52.209
Suddenly you grew
into goddamn towering tulips.

10:52.334 --> 10:56.167
Up through the frozen earth,
and you blossomed -

10:56.292 --> 11:00.792
- and tasted
the sweet pain of the salsa.

11:02.084 --> 11:05.709
Desire and sensuality.

11:07.001 --> 11:12.792
And now, dear friends,
it's time to "haul ass", as you say.

11:12.917 --> 11:16.001
- Are you ready to haul ass?
- Yes!

11:16.667 --> 11:19.376
Five, six, seven, eight.

11:28.751 --> 11:32.251
Come to Papa!

11:42.876 --> 11:45.167
Salsa for Papi!

11:54.292 --> 11:57.709
Malte is such a breath of fresh air.

11:57.834 --> 12:01.501
It doesn't matter if you're from
Nibe or Hollywood.

12:01.626 --> 12:04.917
You grow with him.
I feel I've grown.

12:05.042 --> 12:07.792
Malte has helped us grow, hasn't he?

12:07.917 --> 12:12.292
If Malte wasn't gay,
I bet he'd be a fantastic lover.

12:12.417 --> 12:13.292
Hey!

12:13.417 --> 12:16.084
You can be a good lover
even though you're abnormal.

12:16.209 --> 12:19.876
- Got anything against gays?
- Edward's afraid of gays.

12:20.001 --> 12:24.501
I just don't get gay sex.
Two little bald men headbutting away.

12:24.626 --> 12:28.001
- Men have a hole too.
- Made for something else.

12:28.084 --> 12:31.126
Oh, I don't know.
lb often circles around that hole.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.584
- Come on, Gritt!
- Like a hungry cat around a pâté.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.626
But that's one way
to avoid having children.

12:37.751 --> 12:41.001
When Edward and I loved each other,
we talked about children, too -

12:41.084 --> 12:43.042
- but then we got Little Per.

12:43.167 --> 12:47.584
- Little Per is your surrogate child.
- Hell no!

12:47.709 --> 12:52.917
Is it wrong, if your husband's sperm
quality is okay, to look for a donor?

12:53.042 --> 12:58.584
Women should be free to use the sperm
they want. And lb doesn't want kids.

12:58.709 --> 13:02.459
Try talking a bit louder.
Table 5 can't hear you.

13:02.584 --> 13:06.001
- It must be hard with a guy his size.
- For fuck's sake!

13:06.126 --> 13:11.626
I often think about it when I see you
side by side. He's huge and you're tiny.

13:11.751 --> 13:14.251
- How does he...
- Get it in?

13:14.376 --> 13:18.834
- Yes, technically.
- Well, he only manages to peek in.

13:19.001 --> 13:23.209
- Kinda like the Little Match Girl.
- "Hullo!"

13:26.251 --> 13:29.126
In a little turtleneck.

13:30.626 --> 13:35.376
It's all down to position. No guy can
get in from all corners of the world.

13:35.501 --> 13:38.876
And it's down to how wide
the woman can spread her legs.

13:39.001 --> 13:42.334
- What do you mean, Edward?
- Is this wine sour?

13:42.459 --> 13:48.001
It's sour!
Bent, what kind of red wine is this?

13:50.167 --> 13:53.084
It is...

13:53.209 --> 13:56.501
It is...

13:58.334 --> 14:00.501
It is -

14:00.626 --> 14:03.209
- a red wine.

14:03.334 --> 14:07.584
- Well, I can see that. It's red.
- Leave Bent alone.

14:07.709 --> 14:11.251
- Fine, Bent. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

14:11.376 --> 14:15.334
Who the hell hires a spazz as a waiter?
How does he serve soup?

14:15.459 --> 14:20.251
- I'd like to announce to the table...
- Good thing he isn't a brain surgeon.

14:20.376 --> 14:25.584
I have no problem spreading my legs.
I could do the splits until recently.

14:25.709 --> 14:30.167
Gritt's parents thought for a long time
that Gritt would become a model -

14:30.292 --> 14:34.792
- but then she stopped growing
at the age of 12.

14:37.292 --> 14:39.334
Right!

14:39.459 --> 14:44.001
I guess five-foot tall models
aren't in huge demand -

14:44.084 --> 14:47.876
- unless it's for a hobbit movie.

14:49.459 --> 14:54.501
But hey, good for fairy Malte
that he makes you grow and grow -

14:54.626 --> 14:58.459
- and believe that Hollywood
is located in the church -

14:58.584 --> 15:02.084
- every day between 8 and 10 p.m.

15:13.709 --> 15:18.209
- lb, we're done with this shit.
- What do you mean?

15:19.376 --> 15:23.667
Heinz is right.
We <i>are</i> Dumb and Dumber.

15:25.001 --> 15:29.376
But we're still young, lb.
We've got money -

15:29.501 --> 15:34.334
- and we've worked our asses off
ever since we got kicked out of school.

15:34.459 --> 15:38.167
Let's go to Phuket.
We can live like kings there.

15:38.292 --> 15:40.501
We deserve better.

15:40.626 --> 15:45.667
I didn't like the atmosphere in there.
It got a little embarrassing.

15:45.792 --> 15:50.042
Yeah, just a little perhaps.
You're right, lb.

15:50.167 --> 15:54.251
And we won't get any pussy tonight,
anyway.

15:57.501 --> 15:59.667
Precisely.

16:01.251 --> 16:05.001
We lead an empty and pussy-less life.

16:09.376 --> 16:12.251
- Let's get a divorce.
- You mean that?

16:12.376 --> 16:14.334
I sure as hell do!

16:19.167 --> 16:22.251
- Who recommended me to you?
- No one.

16:22.376 --> 16:25.084
You were the cheapest hit
on PriceRunner.

16:26.376 --> 16:31.042
- You want a divorce?
- Yes. It's gone all Bulgarian on us.

16:31.167 --> 16:34.751
- It's gotten boring.
- Any infidelity?

16:34.876 --> 16:39.001
Not unless dancing with a sissy Swede
qualifies as infidelity.

16:39.084 --> 16:42.376
- So is that you?
- Me?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.001
Who dances around
with a sissy Swede?

16:45.084 --> 16:48.001
We're not the ones getting a divorce.
Hell no.

16:48.126 --> 16:53.209
- No, we're married to our wife.
- To the same woman? But you can't!

16:53.334 --> 16:56.084
- No, we've got one each.
- I see.

16:56.209 --> 17:00.209
So you want to divorce your wives
so you two can get married?

17:00.334 --> 17:03.001
No, we just want to divorce them.

17:03.084 --> 17:06.666
We thought we'd save money
if we chipped in.

17:06.791 --> 17:10.834
- Chipped in?
- Yeah, for you.

17:12.001 --> 17:16.834
- Yes, well, the divorce rules...
- Let me just say one thing.

17:17.001 --> 17:21.376
We want to take good care of the girls.
They must never want for anything.

17:21.501 --> 17:24.501
They haven't lifted a finger
in ten years -

17:24.626 --> 17:28.626
- but we won't leave them in the ditch
without a penny.

17:28.751 --> 17:32.501
- I agree.
- The rules are simple.

17:32.626 --> 17:37.334
- You share everything.
- Sure. They should have their share.

17:37.459 --> 17:41.251
When I look at your assets -

17:41.376 --> 17:46.251
- it all looks pretty good.
Two cars...

17:46.376 --> 17:49.334
Houses...

17:50.459 --> 17:54.792
Property valuation, bills -

17:54.917 --> 17:59.834
- and all of that. You have
pretty large pension savings, huh?

18:00.792 --> 18:03.334
And... Oh, not bad.

18:03.459 --> 18:05.292
All in all...

18:06.334 --> 18:07.626
Yes!

18:08.917 --> 18:12.542
- 2.5 for each.
- Thousand?

18:12.667 --> 18:16.834
- But that's not a whole lot.
- Million.

18:17.001 --> 18:20.751
You have a large equity in your houses
seeing as you built them yourselves.

18:20.876 --> 18:27.334
Add to that alimony amounting
to 4-5,000 kroner a month, minimum.

18:28.792 --> 18:33.626
I hope you feel it was worth it.
On the other hand...

18:37.001 --> 18:40.417
... you got the lawyer cheaper.

18:42.334 --> 18:43.834
Well, I have a meeting now.

18:44.001 --> 18:48.876
Feel free to hang around
and recover from the blow.

18:49.001 --> 18:52.042
Kleenex.
Chipped in...!

18:52.751 --> 18:56.001
- Edward...
- I think I'm going to be sick, lb.

18:56.084 --> 19:00.459
We've got the undeclared money.
Nobody knows about that.

19:04.001 --> 19:07.667
Of course!
lb, we've got the undeclared money.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.917
What the hell is going on?

19:19.042 --> 19:22.042
Oh my lord!

19:24.001 --> 19:27.042
She's on her knees.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.917
That's fucking disgusting.
It's not fair.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.751
He's not even handsome.

19:36.876 --> 19:41.459
- Please repeat that.
- Well, that's the lie of the land.

19:41.584 --> 19:44.917
We've reached the end-station.
You'll get some hard cash -

19:45.042 --> 19:49.626
- and we'll skip the lawyer crap
that only serves to confuse you.

19:49.751 --> 19:54.792
- Please say it one more time.
- Well, we've reached the end-station.

19:54.917 --> 20:00.001
You'll get some hard cash and we'll skip
the lawyer crap that only confuses you.

20:00.126 --> 20:05.126
- It what?
- Confuses you. All that paperwork...

20:05.251 --> 20:08.126
Do I look like an idiot?
Huh?

20:08.251 --> 20:11.917
We have assets worth
five million kroner.

20:12.042 --> 20:16.292
Add to that maximum alimony,
not to mention all the undeclared money.

20:16.417 --> 20:19.834
- What undeclared money do you mean?
- What undeclared money?

20:20.001 --> 20:24.167
- There isn't any undeclared money.
- It's in the fridge in the cellar.

20:25.209 --> 20:27.709
What cellar?

20:30.709 --> 20:32.917
Well, that...

20:34.251 --> 20:38.084
That's the fridge in the cellar.
You're spying on us?

20:38.209 --> 20:41.792
As you said,
we've reached the end-station -

20:41.917 --> 20:45.251
- so one of us has to get off
and walk back -

20:45.376 --> 20:50.709
- and it's only fair that it's you.
You always wear sensible work shoes.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.251
I'm more of a stiletto girl.

20:56.751 --> 21:00.001
- Piglet.
- Yes?

21:10.417 --> 21:13.292
I know this may come as a shock.

21:13.417 --> 21:17.584
How odd!
Ingrid's getting divorced today, too.

21:20.376 --> 21:24.001
Our money. All our money!

21:26.292 --> 21:29.626
We had it all!

21:29.751 --> 21:35.292
Let's just drop the whole idea
and get a sex life online.

21:35.417 --> 21:36.626
- No!
- Yes!

21:36.751 --> 21:40.709
Sex involves both hands.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.751
Both hands!

21:46.709 --> 21:49.084
Both hands!

21:49.209 --> 21:53.251
If only they'd never existed.

21:53.376 --> 21:57.709
It would be so much easier to get
divorced if they weren't there.

21:57.834 --> 22:02.167
You don't have to give half
of everything to someone -

22:02.292 --> 22:07.209
- if they aren't there. If none of us
existed, we wouldn't have a problem.

22:11.001 --> 22:15.667
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Yes! No...

22:15.792 --> 22:18.376
If they weren't here...

22:18.501 --> 22:24.001
- How about we hire a hitman?
- Yes.

22:24.084 --> 22:27.251
- From the east. From Russia.
- Yes!

22:27.376 --> 22:31.834
They're sick in the head.
And they're broke.

22:32.001 --> 22:33.917
We'll send for one.

22:34.042 --> 22:36.292
Bang bang.

22:36.417 --> 22:40.667
Wham bang thank you ma'am.

22:49.292 --> 22:51.751
Edward...

23:12.876 --> 23:16.126
Yeah, a guy from the East.

25:33.751 --> 25:38.917
Hello.
Hi, Edward. So you're awake?

25:39.042 --> 25:44.126
No, he's been asleep for 48 hours.
Or maybe he's dead. I didn't check.

25:46.084 --> 25:48.626
Are you dead?

25:51.084 --> 25:54.542
- You hired a Russian hitman!
- I was drunk!

25:54.667 --> 25:59.042
So was I, but I didn't hire
a goddamn Russian hitman!

25:59.167 --> 26:01.917
A Russian hitman.
I'm going insane!

26:02.042 --> 26:04.084
Stupid, stupid Edward!

26:04.209 --> 26:06.001
Gritt, I'm sorry!

26:06.084 --> 26:08.001
Stupid, stupid Edward!

26:08.126 --> 26:12.542
Shit! You're gonna have
to call it off. It's as simple as that.

26:12.667 --> 26:15.001
Write and call the whole thing off.

26:15.084 --> 26:18.917
I told you already, I tried.
The link expired.

26:19.042 --> 26:24.001
You pay half, and the link expires.
That's the deal when you hire a hitman.

26:24.084 --> 26:28.001
All that's left is this.
Igor Lad... whatever.

26:28.126 --> 26:31.292
Arrival from Kiev 2:45 p.m.

26:31.417 --> 26:34.751
He's on his way?!

26:34.876 --> 26:39.001
Maybe he won't recognize us.
All he knows is that we live in Nibe -

26:39.084 --> 26:43.542
- and there are lots of people in Nibe.
A whole lot.

26:43.667 --> 26:46.834
There are people living in Nibe
in all kinds of houses.

26:47.001 --> 26:50.042
But he's got the email address
and the name.

26:50.167 --> 26:55.001
He knows exactly where to go.
He's a professional killer, lb.

26:55.126 --> 26:58.584
I've got it. Let's go to the airport
and tell him it's a misunderstanding.

26:58.709 --> 27:03.709
Good idea. We'll give him a decent tip
and say it's all a misunderstanding.

27:04.459 --> 27:06.251
How hard can it be?

27:25.126 --> 27:30.042
- What if 100 dollars isn't enough?
- Hell, it's a year's income in Russia.

27:30.167 --> 27:34.001
- Got the return ticket?
- Yup. Moscow 6:45 p.m.

27:34.084 --> 27:38.667
- Good. And then this never happened.
- It already never happened.

27:38.792 --> 27:42.459
We'll treat him to a steak
and a couple of bottles of Rioja -

27:42.584 --> 27:45.251
- and there you have it.

27:59.042 --> 28:01.459
Oh my...

28:04.792 --> 28:07.376
He sure is drunk.

28:07.501 --> 28:11.167
I'll give him that.
Impressive.

28:34.459 --> 28:38.417
My friends...
My friends.

28:56.167 --> 28:57.167
Hi.

28:57.292 --> 29:01.584
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Nah, we don't really know him.

29:01.709 --> 29:05.084
- Then why are you holding his name?
- Well...

29:05.209 --> 29:08.626
- What's his business here?
- We're builders.

29:08.751 --> 29:14.251
- Igor's here to help us... build.
- Nothing illegal.

29:14.376 --> 29:19.209
But we don't need him after all,
so we've bought him a return ticket.

29:19.334 --> 29:22.751
No way.
He's not flying in that state.

29:22.876 --> 29:26.001
Get him out of here.
Immediately!

29:31.126 --> 29:36.834
We'll take a taxi to the Scandic.
We won't draw attention in a taxi.

29:37.001 --> 29:40.292
We'll get him a room, pour
some coffee on him to sober him up -

29:40.417 --> 29:43.292
- and then we go back here,
he flies back home -

29:43.417 --> 29:46.167
- we go home.
It never happened.

30:05.251 --> 30:09.584
Your friend is okay, right?
He can't puke in my taxi...

30:09.709 --> 30:11.917
I'm gonna get really mad.

30:12.042 --> 30:16.251
He's from Russia.
They hardly ever puke.

30:16.376 --> 30:18.209
Infidel Russian.

30:18.334 --> 30:21.751
Godless pig eater,
drunk, foolish dog!

30:21.876 --> 30:25.376
I curse you to hell -

30:25.501 --> 30:29.709
- and I'm going to take a long,
expensive detour to steal your money!

30:31.001 --> 30:33.792
You damn Taliban bastard.

30:33.917 --> 30:37.834
I curse you and your family
and hope you burn in hell.

30:38.001 --> 30:41.001
You talking to me,
you Russian son of a bitch?

30:41.126 --> 30:45.334
I'm going to pull out your intestines
through your filthy throat -

30:45.459 --> 30:48.209
- and hang you in the nearest tree!

30:48.334 --> 30:52.584
Damn you! I'm going to do that to you,
you filthy shit-for-brains!

30:52.709 --> 30:54.667
Stop... stop.

30:54.792 --> 30:57.876
You son of a bitch! I'm going
to kill you, you crazy bastard!

30:58.001 --> 31:01.667
- Stop the car!
- What stop?! Where stop?!

31:01.792 --> 31:04.126
You crazy Russian!

31:04.251 --> 31:08.667
I'll kill you good! We kicked
your entire family out of your country!

31:10.876 --> 31:12.209
Come here, you..!

31:21.876 --> 31:27.126
I can't deal with all that negative
energy in such a confined space.

31:27.251 --> 31:31.084
So much... hatred
between people, Edward.

31:31.209 --> 31:36.459
We're going to sober him up,
and then we're going home.

31:44.126 --> 31:47.251
Well, let's get... going.

31:48.209 --> 31:50.876
Taliban monkey not so loud anymore.

31:51.001 --> 31:53.792
But you don't worry, you my friends.
Igor kill for free.

31:53.917 --> 31:57.334
Besides, he don't care.
He wasn't happy.

31:57.459 --> 32:02.792
Now, I promise he's much happier now
with his 72 fucking virgins.

32:02.917 --> 32:07.209
Now he's happier.
Now he's with his virgins. I'm sorry.

32:13.251 --> 32:16.751
For fuck's sake.
lb, this isn't happening, is it?

32:16.876 --> 32:20.626
We're going to jail on account of a
drunk Russian that we don't even know.

32:20.751 --> 32:25.792
Edward, we have to take him home with
us. And we can't just leave the body.

32:25.917 --> 32:29.251
- Someone's gonna find him.
- Someone?

32:29.376 --> 32:33.084
That poor immigrant guy and his
immigrant kids who are now fatherless.

32:33.209 --> 32:37.001
Maybe he's a fucking ISIS who whips
his family with the Quran every night.

32:37.084 --> 32:41.084
But you don't know that!
Prejudice... bah!

32:41.209 --> 32:44.501
Well, Igor, let's go.

33:11.542 --> 33:14.917
- Let's go get a beer at the inn.
- But what if the girls come home?

33:15.042 --> 33:18.001
Gritt said they were sleeping at your
place. It's just you and me tonight.

33:27.459 --> 33:30.751
Are there any real men left?

33:31.709 --> 33:34.917
I really want a child.

33:35.042 --> 33:38.376
I'm going on 40, and my ovaries
are beginning to look like prunes.

33:41.626 --> 33:44.501
Soon I can only have kids
with nuchal folds.

33:44.626 --> 33:45.792
Yuck!

33:54.042 --> 33:59.584
- I thought we were going to my place.
- You never have any wine.

34:02.042 --> 34:04.376
Will we be happy without them?

34:04.501 --> 34:07.876
Oh, come on.
We're gonna have a ball!

34:08.001 --> 34:11.292
You'll meet other men who look you
in the eye instead of ogling your ass.

34:11.417 --> 34:16.292
Who can dance, think and go
to the art museum and watch PBS -

34:16.417 --> 34:20.417
- and who talk about other stuff
than stone wool.

34:30.458 --> 34:33.626
- Is this the reception?
- Is he one of their Poles?

34:34.792 --> 34:38.208
- Where is the mini bar?
- How dare he prance in like that?

34:38.333 --> 34:42.876
They stay in the cellar from time
to time, but they never come upstairs.

34:48.083 --> 34:53.001
Life is nothing without beauty and love.
Love is what makes you happy -

34:53.083 --> 34:55.917
- and if you're not happy,
there is no reason to live.

34:56.042 --> 34:59.876
So when Igor meets two beautiful women,
he sees lots of love -

35:00.001 --> 35:03.751
- and that makes him very happy.

35:03.876 --> 35:07.001
And I do not say that because I'm drunk.

35:07.084 --> 35:10.792
Igor is always drunk
and sees ugly women all the time.

35:10.917 --> 35:16.042
But you are very, very,
very beautiful.

35:17.084 --> 35:20.084
Who says you can leave your cellar?

35:21.126 --> 35:24.459
Who says you can leave your cellar?

35:26.292 --> 35:28.542
You are so hungry woman.

35:28.667 --> 35:34.001
You are like a juicy wet oasis. An oasis
just waiting to feed a thirsty man -

35:34.126 --> 35:39.001
- but you, so beautiful, where is your
thirsty man? No one drinks from you.

35:39.084 --> 35:42.792
And you, beautiful.
Like a painting by Da Vinci.

35:42.917 --> 35:45.876
Please come. Please.

35:46.001 --> 35:48.001
Please!

35:48.084 --> 35:52.751
Where is your man to see
your secret smile, beautiful lips?

35:52.876 --> 35:56.584
I like it very much.
Beautiful.

35:57.251 --> 35:59.751
Thank you.

35:59.876 --> 36:03.542
- Well, Malte, our dance teacher...
- Dance teacher?

36:03.667 --> 36:08.001
He thinks we are very passionate.
He's a Swede.

36:08.084 --> 36:12.751
Gay, of course, and sometimes
he compares us to two tulips.

36:12.876 --> 36:17.876
You tulips? But tulip is nothing
but the stupid vegetable.

36:18.001 --> 36:24.126
You are not vegetables!
You are women made of flesh and blood!

36:27.209 --> 36:30.917
- This is for every virgin I ever loved.
- Oh my.

36:31.042 --> 36:35.126
She feels a little pain
and I see the tear in her eye.

36:35.251 --> 36:39.751
And Igor says:
If she feels a little pain -

36:39.876 --> 36:43.376
- so Igor shall feel a little pain, too.

36:43.501 --> 36:47.542
So I stab myself every time with knife,
very painful.

36:47.667 --> 36:53.584
You know, guys from the Eastern bloc
can be <i>very</i> romantic.

36:53.709 --> 36:58.209
- You can say that again.
- Very.

37:00.459 --> 37:02.209
Can I...

37:04.626 --> 37:07.001
What's this?

37:07.084 --> 37:10.917
- It's also women you...?
- No.

37:11.042 --> 37:15.042
This is all the men I killed.

37:15.167 --> 37:19.542
- What?
- So you really tried to kill somebody?

37:19.667 --> 37:22.001
- Okay.
- How is it?

37:22.084 --> 37:24.917
- To kill somebody?
- Yes.

37:26.459 --> 37:28.376
Oh, it's nothing.

37:28.501 --> 37:31.876
First they breathe,
then they don't breathe.

37:32.751 --> 37:37.334
So, you stay long here in Nibe?

37:39.001 --> 37:41.834
As long as it takes.

37:42.001 --> 37:46.167
- Do you know lb and Edward?
- Yes.

37:46.292 --> 37:48.501
They are my new friends.

37:48.626 --> 37:52.251
- You keep secrets with me?
- Of course.

37:52.376 --> 37:56.751
Wives not make them happy anymore.

37:58.084 --> 38:00.459
What do you precisely mean by that?

38:00.584 --> 38:04.626
Igor help them
not to be unhappy anymore.

38:04.751 --> 38:06.584
How?

38:06.709 --> 38:08.042
I kill them.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.209
You know where I can find them?

38:47.626 --> 38:49.709
Igor?

38:50.584 --> 38:56.626
You need something
stronger than wine, yes.

38:58.001 --> 39:00.834
- You need whisky.
- Okay.

39:01.001 --> 39:04.001
Where am I, by the way?
Is this hotel lobby?

39:04.084 --> 39:07.042
We go and we buy...

39:08.001 --> 39:10.209
... whisky.
Lots of whisky.

39:10.334 --> 39:14.042
And you can stay here in hotel lobby.

39:16.917 --> 39:19.751
- What are we gonna do?
- Get in the car!

39:19.876 --> 39:22.542
You're too drunk to drive.

39:29.251 --> 39:33.334
- I think I've peed my pants.
- Shit, Gritt!

39:33.459 --> 39:35.751
We're married to a couple of killers!

39:35.876 --> 39:39.376
I don't remember
when I last peed my pants.

39:39.501 --> 39:42.084
Fuck!
Ever heard anything that wild?

39:42.209 --> 39:46.626
Maybe it was at camp in '92...

39:46.751 --> 39:50.459
You don't chip in for a hitman.
If anyone's gonna kill me -

39:50.584 --> 39:54.209
- I want my own personal killer.

39:54.334 --> 39:56.417
I peed on my shoes... everywhere.

40:01.709 --> 40:05.084
- And then I saw...
- Have you been drinking?

40:05.209 --> 40:09.584
What the fuck do you think?
Do I seem sober or shitfaced?

40:09.709 --> 40:13.709
Down my legs and into my shoes...

40:13.834 --> 40:17.626
"What is this?
Did you pee your pants?"

40:18.667 --> 40:20.584
I peed my pants.

40:20.709 --> 40:24.667
Damn! It burst.
That's a first.

40:24.792 --> 40:26.834
Get out of the car.

40:27.001 --> 40:31.917
And the bitches can sleep on the couch
in a studio apartment on loser street.

40:32.042 --> 40:33.542
Loser street.

40:33.667 --> 40:37.751
They go see a lawyer only to find out
they're married to two strong women.

40:37.876 --> 40:41.501
Strong women
who knows their rights, Gritt.

40:41.626 --> 40:44.876
- Free women like you and me, Gritt.
- Yeah, we're totally free.

40:46.626 --> 40:49.209
We may very well be from Nibe -

40:49.334 --> 40:53.251
- but Malte says
this might as well be Hollywood -

40:53.376 --> 40:58.042
- and those women over there know how
to squeeze the last cent out of a man.

40:58.167 --> 41:02.626
- The last cunt?
- No, the last cent out of a man.

41:02.751 --> 41:04.667
We'll show them!

41:04.792 --> 41:08.376
We have a future, Gritt.
We can dance our way through life.

41:08.501 --> 41:11.917
- They can only sit on their fat asses.
- Hell, we'll convert Malte.

41:12.042 --> 41:16.459
- Yeah, why not?
- With our gigantic big balls.

41:17.376 --> 41:19.334
We rock!

41:19.459 --> 41:24.751
We'll be lucky to find a drop of blood
in your alcohol. What were you thinking?

41:24.876 --> 41:28.042
- You're looking at a minimum of...
- Where?

41:28.167 --> 41:31.001
- Where are you going?
- Where's the cell, Heinz?

41:31.084 --> 41:33.292
Down the end of the hall, 9 o'clock.

41:36.292 --> 41:39.042
He's been awake.

41:39.167 --> 41:42.834
No man can drink that much.

41:58.209 --> 42:02.001
Why don't we just tell the police?

42:02.084 --> 42:05.542
- The police?
- Yes.

42:05.667 --> 42:08.667
"Why don't we just tell the police?"

42:08.792 --> 42:13.376
- What can the police do?
- They can fix it.

42:13.501 --> 42:16.334
- Fix it? The police?
- Yes.

42:17.376 --> 42:21.084
No, they'll put them away for a couple
of years, and when they're released -

42:21.209 --> 42:24.501
- they'll rob us of everything anyway.

42:25.584 --> 42:28.417
The police!

42:38.709 --> 42:41.584
If they can hire a killer...

42:46.834 --> 42:49.292
... why can't we?

42:51.001 --> 42:54.334
Well, because it's against the law.

42:54.459 --> 42:56.917
- Against the law?
- Yes.

42:57.042 --> 43:00.001
No, it's equality!

43:04.126 --> 43:06.834
It's equality, Gritt. Hey!

43:07.001 --> 43:11.501
We have just as much right
to be bastards as men.

43:11.626 --> 43:13.501
Sure.

43:15.042 --> 43:18.876
- Okay.
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do...

43:33.334 --> 43:36.251
- Sure this is a good idea?
- We have to defend ourselves.

43:36.376 --> 43:42.709
- And Igor? Think she's a match for him?
- Wait and see. This girl is special.

43:42.834 --> 43:48.334
The British have got style. Downton
Abbey, Midsomer Murders and so on.

43:48.459 --> 43:52.917
The British are posh.
Discreet and soundless.

43:53.042 --> 43:56.459
When something is really complicated -

43:56.584 --> 43:59.292
- they just sweep it under the rug.

43:59.417 --> 44:02.542
- I need to go pee again.
- And I'm thirsty.

44:02.667 --> 44:05.667
- Shouldn't she have landed by now?
- I need some wine.

44:25.792 --> 44:29.001
Excuse me.
Where do you come from?

44:29.126 --> 44:32.001
Oh, I'm sorry, young man.

44:32.084 --> 44:35.084
I didn't think that
you'd be taking any interest -

44:35.209 --> 44:39.167
- in a silly old woman like me.
I'm flattered, dear.

44:39.292 --> 44:42.126
It's check-up day today,
so pure routine.

44:42.251 --> 44:44.001
I understand, dear.

44:44.084 --> 44:48.584
Now, what am I smuggling into this
lovely little country of yours today?

44:48.709 --> 44:53.042
Hard drugs, endangered species
or lethal weapons?

44:53.167 --> 44:57.042
- Can I check your bag?
- You most certainly may.

45:08.459 --> 45:11.001
Good God!

45:15.584 --> 45:19.667
Ingrid, I don't like this.

45:19.792 --> 45:25.542
No, but let's go to the summerhouse
and get acquainted, okay?

45:25.667 --> 45:29.251
Sure she's not crazy? I think
she's straight out of a horror movie.

45:29.376 --> 45:32.334
No, she's just an oddball.

45:32.459 --> 45:37.417
You can't get enough of oddballs.
They're just barmy.

45:37.542 --> 45:42.001
Mrs. Nipplesworthy, we are going now
to a very nice and cozy place.

45:42.084 --> 45:45.084
- Is there anything you need?
- Liver.

45:46.084 --> 45:47.834
- Liver?
- Liver?

45:48.001 --> 45:49.626
Raw liver.

45:49.751 --> 45:53.667
With a nice bottle of Chianti.

45:59.876 --> 46:02.834
Ladies... ladies!

46:03.001 --> 46:07.292
I'm only messing with you.

46:14.084 --> 46:16.626
So you want me to erase his memory?

46:16.751 --> 46:21.126
Not all of it.
Just the last couple of days maybe.

46:22.376 --> 46:25.251
- What is this all about?
- We'll give you 5,000 kroner.

46:25.376 --> 46:29.792
It's purely business. We brought him in
from the East to help us -

46:29.917 --> 46:33.917
- but he drinks too much.
He's Russian and more or less useless.

46:34.042 --> 46:37.626
Still, we felt bad
having dragged him all the way here -

46:37.751 --> 46:41.251
- only to fire him on the spot.

46:41.376 --> 46:45.459
So we thought it would be better
if he'd never had that experience.

46:50.834 --> 46:53.792
You're so full of crap.

46:53.917 --> 46:56.917
- 20,000.
- Done deal!

46:57.042 --> 46:59.834
- Wait outside.
- Deal.

47:00.001 --> 47:03.084
lb... Where are you going?

47:08.251 --> 47:10.042
Poul?

47:13.084 --> 47:15.292
Poul!

47:18.626 --> 47:20.792
What the hell are you doing?

47:25.751 --> 47:29.042
- Where did you find her again?
- She had a website.

47:29.167 --> 47:33.542
- A website?
- Yeah, to do with euthanasia.

47:33.667 --> 47:36.251
- Euthanasia?
- Yeah.

47:36.376 --> 47:41.126
She worked at a home for many years -

47:41.251 --> 47:45.584
- and was unjustly convicted of having
helped a lot of miserable old -

47:45.709 --> 47:50.042
- really broken old people,
who were dying anyway.

47:50.167 --> 47:55.917
She's dedicated her life to helping
people, who need to die, to die.

47:57.001 --> 48:01.626
And she also helps out
if you need help -

48:01.751 --> 48:06.542
- to make other people,
who need to die, die.

48:06.667 --> 48:10.376
People, who want to die...
but perhaps don't know it yet.

48:11.292 --> 48:13.292
What home did she work at?

48:13.417 --> 48:19.001
- I think it was Broadmoor Home...
- Home for what?

48:19.084 --> 48:22.459
Broadmoor Mental Institution is -

48:22.584 --> 48:26.709
- a well-reputed home
for psychopaths, sweethearts.

48:26.834 --> 48:29.542
Okay.

48:29.667 --> 48:34.042
- You worked there as a nurse, or...?
- Yes, of course.

48:34.167 --> 48:37.667
Yes, of course I was a nurse.

48:42.501 --> 48:46.542
"Now you travel back in your life, Igor.
Now you let yourself fall -

48:46.667 --> 48:48.834
- and see the job you should do."

48:49.001 --> 48:52.584
Igor says this is nuts,
but stupid woman says:

48:52.709 --> 48:56.042
"Yes, you see the job
you should do for lb and Edward."

48:56.167 --> 48:58.834
"No, no," I say. "I don't see any job."

48:59.001 --> 49:01.917
"Oh yes," she says. "You will."

49:02.042 --> 49:04.917
And then she hypnotize.

49:05.042 --> 49:10.834
And then Igor sees all Igor's jobs!
They come to me, everyone of them!

49:11.001 --> 49:15.251
The Taliban swine, the three
horny midgets, the six Chinamen -

49:15.376 --> 49:18.167
- the stupid journalist,
who didn't like my friend Putin -

49:18.292 --> 49:22.209
- the woman with the big dick etc. etc.
So now she starts screaming.

49:22.334 --> 49:25.334
So Igor wake up.
"Why do you scream, stupid woman?"

49:25.459 --> 49:30.626
- So she screams: "Police! Police!"
- Yes, we heard. We heard.

49:31.542 --> 49:35.084
- She never should have locked the door.
- I asked her: "Why do you scream?"

49:35.209 --> 49:40.001
"Please stop screaming, you ugly woman
with ugly glasses. Please stop...!"

49:40.126 --> 49:43.084
Did you really have to...

49:44.417 --> 49:50.126
You know, Igor help.
Igor put her out of her misery.

49:50.251 --> 49:53.542
I could see she was not happy.

50:00.917 --> 50:05.126
Always look for the positive,
my mom always said.

50:05.251 --> 50:07.917
Like when my budgie died.

50:08.042 --> 50:12.126
"See, lb. The good thing
about the budgie dying is -

50:12.251 --> 50:17.501
- that you can get a stuffed budgie now.
Not many people have that."

50:18.542 --> 50:21.917
Maybe all these horrific experiences
are good for us.

50:22.042 --> 50:26.542
I mean, right now we're parked right
in the middle of nature.

50:26.667 --> 50:30.917
Look! A live lark.
It gives you food for thought -

50:31.042 --> 50:35.167
- that in the middle of all this mess
there's still stuff to rejoice in.

50:35.292 --> 50:39.917
Hell, lb, you're going crazy.
Pull yourself together, lb.

50:41.417 --> 50:45.292
No... I didn't mean it like that.

50:48.042 --> 50:51.417
I miss my budgie.

50:55.167 --> 50:58.042
And here comes Heinz.

51:04.501 --> 51:06.626
Well...

51:15.042 --> 51:18.751
So, what's up, Dumb and Dumber?

51:18.876 --> 51:21.876
- Yeah, what's up, Heinz?
- Drunk bitches.

51:22.001 --> 51:25.917
Moonlighting.
What's next?

51:26.042 --> 51:30.126
Now that your missus
has lost her license -

51:30.251 --> 51:33.167
- her Mercedes is just collecting dust
in the garage.

51:33.292 --> 51:37.917
- What do you want, Heinz?
- Why, I want a Mercedes.

51:38.042 --> 51:41.667
- If you can moonlight, so can I.
- Why?

51:41.792 --> 51:43.626
Why?

51:43.751 --> 51:46.667
It's up to you whether I should drive
toward you with the tax man -

51:46.792 --> 51:50.251
- or drive off in a Mercedes.

51:54.292 --> 51:57.834
- Who's that guy?
- Just a friend of ours.

51:58.001 --> 52:01.542
- Yeah, he's just a friend.
- Oh. Does he have a work permit?

52:02.376 --> 52:05.334
Hey there.

52:05.459 --> 52:08.542
I'd like to see your passport,
papers and work permit.

52:08.667 --> 52:10.876
Right away.

52:11.001 --> 52:14.126
- Hello.
- Heinz, he doesn't speak Danish.

52:14.251 --> 52:17.917
- Heinz, you'd better not.
- Frigging Poles.

52:18.042 --> 52:22.334
Don't piss him off.
Igor's from Russia, not Poland.

52:22.459 --> 52:25.084
So what's he gonna do?
Blow on me?

52:26.876 --> 52:29.334
Hey, buster.

52:29.459 --> 52:32.751
Let me see your papers,
passport and work permit.

52:32.876 --> 52:37.001
It's a bad idea, Heinz.
You are a human being after all.

52:37.126 --> 52:39.626
- What?
- You've got a heart, too.

52:39.751 --> 52:43.376
- Haven't you got a wife and kids?
- Not on your life!

52:43.501 --> 52:47.001
- A dad or a mom?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

52:47.126 --> 52:51.751
All the people who love you
and who you love and go on picnics with.

52:51.876 --> 52:54.459
No, all that family crap just isn't me.

52:54.584 --> 52:59.042
So the day you pass away,
no one will mourn you -

52:59.167 --> 53:03.334
- with a cake buffet
and cousins singing country songs?

53:04.459 --> 53:09.084
You're losing it big time.
What the hell are you guys up to?

53:09.209 --> 53:11.584
- Is this your friend?
- No.

53:11.709 --> 53:16.917
I actually feel a bit sad for him,
because you know -

53:17.042 --> 53:20.042
- Heinz is not very happy.

53:20.167 --> 53:22.917
- lb!
- Not happy?

53:23.042 --> 53:25.917
Not happy at all, Igor.

53:27.001 --> 53:29.709
No love, no family -

53:29.834 --> 53:32.417
- and not very happy.

53:32.542 --> 53:34.751
lb, what the fuck are you up to?

53:34.876 --> 53:37.834
- You bet your ass I'm not very happy.
- Damn.

53:38.001 --> 53:41.709
Look, tell me what's going on.
Out of the way, buddy.

53:41.834 --> 53:46.417
You're digging a hole in the middle
of nowhere. What's going on?

53:46.542 --> 53:48.209
What is this?

53:48.334 --> 53:49.626
No!

53:52.834 --> 53:55.667
It's... No, never mind the time!

53:57.709 --> 54:00.001
You're under arrest
and you have the right to one...

54:00.126 --> 54:02.542
He doesn't speak Danish, Heinz.

54:02.667 --> 54:07.084
You have the right to maintain silence,
and according to law you can just...

54:07.209 --> 54:09.209
Okay.

54:21.042 --> 54:22.709
We have more drink?

54:24.917 --> 54:30.126
Well, lb.
This is the end of the road.

54:30.251 --> 54:33.626
Heinz is going to get help.
It's all over-

54:33.751 --> 54:35.917
- and I will accept my punishment.

54:36.042 --> 54:39.126
- It'll ease my gut and my mind...
- Car keys... where are the keys?

54:39.251 --> 54:43.792
We'll get everything out in the open.
Don't worry, I'll take the rap.

54:43.917 --> 54:48.834
No need for both of us to spend 12 years
in the can getting buggered by goons.

54:49.001 --> 54:52.042
Don't get all worked up.
Igor's got a handle on it.

54:52.167 --> 54:57.459
Let's just be happy
that it can't possibly get any worse.

55:04.751 --> 55:07.917
- He missed.
- You're way too negative.

55:15.834 --> 55:20.626
No, we won't get away with this.
I've seen it too many times on TV, lb.

55:20.751 --> 55:25.917
A man walks his dog, and the dog comes
back with a big bone wearing a sock.

55:26.834 --> 55:30.001
Next thing you know,
you're the star of a lame crime docu.

55:30.126 --> 55:34.417
We have to find a better place
where they won't be found.

55:39.917 --> 55:43.626
How slowly would you like it to happen?

55:43.751 --> 55:46.001
How slow?

56:03.459 --> 56:08.917
Now, this will leave them bleeding
for several hours -

56:09.042 --> 56:12.459
- before their eyes pop out
of their heads.

56:13.667 --> 56:16.417
It's quite painful, it must be said.

56:16.542 --> 56:20.251
Meanwhile, now this one...

56:21.667 --> 56:26.417
I call this Autumn Leaves.

56:27.584 --> 56:31.001
This will prolong the process
even further still -

56:31.126 --> 56:35.292
- causing to lose their hair and teeth
over a period of several weeks -

56:35.417 --> 56:42.126
- before finally their skin peels off
like leaves in autumn.

56:42.251 --> 56:45.667
Yes... yes.

56:45.792 --> 56:49.667
Anything tickle your fancy, ladies?

56:51.084 --> 56:53.459
First and foremost -

56:53.584 --> 56:58.292
- I personally don't think
their eyes should pop out.

56:58.417 --> 57:02.501
I think this eye-popping-out thing
sounds a little too much.

57:02.626 --> 57:07.542
What do you think, Ingrid?
Do you think their eyes should...

57:07.667 --> 57:09.417
No, no.

57:09.542 --> 57:13.584
No, personally,
I don't like the eye thing -

57:13.709 --> 57:17.792
- and also I don't know
about the Autumn Leaves.

57:17.917 --> 57:22.667
So difficult to decide.
Right, Gritt?

57:22.792 --> 57:28.376
Yes, it's very difficult.
So many things to choose among.

57:28.501 --> 57:34.126
Maybe it's all a little bit
too dramatic.

57:34.251 --> 57:38.792
Perhaps we could find something
a little more simple.

57:38.917 --> 57:42.376
- More Scandinavian style?
- Yes, more Scandinavian maybe.

57:42.501 --> 57:45.209
You mean dull and dark?

57:47.834 --> 57:52.292
Perhaps we could concentrate on Igor.

57:52.417 --> 57:57.376
And perhaps just give lb and Edward -

57:57.501 --> 57:59.584
- perhaps just a little warning?

57:59.709 --> 58:03.042
A little warning?

58:03.167 --> 58:06.334
Maybe just... I dunno...

58:07.417 --> 58:10.459
Maybe just a little
unexpected diarrhea maybe.

58:10.584 --> 58:14.792
- Diarrhea?
- Just a little pooh-pooh in the pants.

58:19.876 --> 58:24.626
Pooh-pooh!
That would be hysterical.

58:25.417 --> 58:28.001
You asked me to come here.

58:28.084 --> 58:34.251
I packed my things. I put a great deal
of effort into my preparations.

58:34.376 --> 58:39.584
Because that is what we British
stand for. Discipline. Honor.

58:39.709 --> 58:44.834
And last, but not least, the renouncing
of the revolting human body.

58:45.001 --> 58:50.126
And what do I mean by that? Well,
the British do not like the human body.

58:50.251 --> 58:55.001
We live with it, it's true. Because we
have no option. We are forced to do so.

58:55.084 --> 59:01.709
And that is precisely why
I am skilled at what I do.

59:01.834 --> 59:07.626
I am an expert at helping people
vacate their bodies.

59:07.751 --> 59:12.167
That is my calling.
That is my life's work.

59:12.292 --> 59:18.292
I am here to save us all
from our human bodies!

59:27.542 --> 59:31.876
- She's utterly crazy.
- No, we're utterly nuts.

59:32.001 --> 59:35.709
- What the hell are we doing?
- Let's keep a cool head now.

59:38.001 --> 59:41.126
Why the hell didn't we buy more?

59:41.251 --> 59:44.834
I can't think without Chardonnay.
I'm going out for more.

59:45.001 --> 59:48.667
- Are you leaving me alone with that?
- Everything's going to be okay.

59:48.792 --> 59:51.001
I just need some wine.

59:55.417 --> 59:59.126
What a surprise.

59:59.251 --> 01:00:04.001
- When do you expect to finish it?
- We found a pile of bricks.

01:00:04.126 --> 01:00:07.292
And more are on the way from...

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:09.626
From Krakow.

01:00:09.751 --> 01:00:15.334
- Isn't it quite wide?
- What do you mean, Mrs. Hansen?

01:00:16.501 --> 01:00:19.667
It's almost a meter wide.

01:00:21.292 --> 01:00:25.542
Yes, it's a solid wall
that no one can ever tear down again -

01:00:25.667 --> 01:00:30.792
- so that they'd find something
or someone inside it.

01:00:30.917 --> 01:00:34.376
- Not that there'd be that in a wall.
- Mrs. Hansen.

01:00:34.501 --> 01:00:36.667
Thanks, lb.

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:41.251
- Can we have a cup of coffee?
- You bet.

01:00:45.084 --> 01:00:46.084
There!

01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:48.917
Well, well...

01:00:51.417 --> 01:00:53.709
Maybe we should wall him up, too?

01:00:53.834 --> 01:00:56.792
I don't think Igor's very happy.

01:00:56.917 --> 01:01:01.126
No, it must be hard to sleep with
so many dead people on your conscience.

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:05.417
Tell you what, lb.

01:01:05.542 --> 01:01:08.376
- I'm going to tell it to him straight.
- No. Are you crazy?

01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:12.542
- I'll keep a civil tone.
- He's gonna kill us. You can't!

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:15.167
Igor... Igor.

01:01:15.292 --> 01:01:20.001
It's all a big misunderstanding.
You don't need to kill our wives.

01:01:20.126 --> 01:01:25.126
It was just me and lb...
a little crazy one night.

01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:29.292
- It's not because we don't like you.
- No, absolutely not.

01:01:29.417 --> 01:01:34.126
We like you a lot.
You have a great charisma and...

01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:40.084
We also want you to know that we
think you are a very, very good killer.

01:01:40.209 --> 01:01:42.584
Oh, absolutely.

01:01:42.709 --> 01:01:47.584
Truth is, Igor, we don't want you
to kill anyone anymore.

01:01:47.709 --> 01:01:51.542
- You are getting soft.
- Look, Igor.

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:56.001
You don't have to kill your wife
or your husband -

01:01:56.126 --> 01:01:58.167
- because you don't make love anymore.

01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:01.876
Actually, it's very normal in this
country that you stop having sex -

01:02:02.001 --> 01:02:04.209
- when you get married.

01:02:04.334 --> 01:02:06.001
Then what do they do?

01:02:06.084 --> 01:02:10.126
They... they take care of the dog -

01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:12.501
- or the kids.

01:02:12.626 --> 01:02:16.417
You know, jog together and go
to Silvan Saturday morning -

01:02:16.542 --> 01:02:19.876
- and buy a <i>have</i> grill, for example.

01:02:20.001 --> 01:02:24.876
<i>- Have</i> grill?
- You know, cozy time with <i>have</i> grill.

01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:27.917
- No.
- No?

01:02:28.042 --> 01:02:32.501
You are my friends. I don't want you
to live unhappy lousy lives -

01:02:32.626 --> 01:02:35.001
- with your frigid wives.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:39.584
But wives love us again.
They're not frigid anymore, nope.

01:02:41.042 --> 01:02:45.292
Okay.
If they really love you again -

01:02:45.417 --> 01:02:49.001
- I want to hear it
from their own mouths.

01:02:49.084 --> 01:02:51.709
Not from you two soft chicken.

01:02:53.417 --> 01:02:55.459
Of course, Igor.
You're absolutely right.

01:02:55.584 --> 01:02:59.667
Of course you should hear it from their
mouths, and you should meet them -

01:02:59.792 --> 01:03:03.584
- and you should talk to them. Then they
will tell you how much they love us.

01:03:03.709 --> 01:03:06.709
And then you can go home.

01:03:06.834 --> 01:03:09.792
- Okay.
- But we'll never talk them into that!

01:03:11.667 --> 01:03:14.084
lb, I've got a plan.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:19.292
How terrible.
The girls haven't said a word.

01:03:19.417 --> 01:03:22.917
Both of you at the same time?

01:03:23.042 --> 01:03:26.292
Where is God in all this?
Is it work-related?

01:03:26.417 --> 01:03:29.626
- I'm sure it is.
- All the stuff you inhale.

01:03:29.751 --> 01:03:33.876
I haven't got any wigs for men,
but I can cut these in shape.

01:03:34.001 --> 01:03:36.209
You haven't lost your hair yet.

01:03:36.334 --> 01:03:39.292
The chemo will make it
come off in giant tufts.

01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:41.751
Try them on.

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:46.417
- Hi, lb.
- Bent.

01:03:46.542 --> 01:03:48.417
Hi, Edward.

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:53.876
What's up?
How come you look like that?

01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:59.542
- lb and Edward have got cancer.
- Yeah, we're gonna be bald as eggs.

01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:02.001
Skinheads.

01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:04.376
You... you...

01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:08.626
You just ought to...

01:04:08.751 --> 01:04:11.584
... ought to go to...

01:04:11.709 --> 01:04:14.334
Bent thinks you should take up salsa.

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:18.376
Salsa, Bent.
Hell, that's just what we need -

01:04:18.501 --> 01:04:21.542
- with a body full of cancer.
For fuck's sake!

01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:26.001
- Thank you, Bent.
- You're welcome, my friend.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:42.876
- Why do we always make fun of Bent?
- Because we always have.

01:04:43.001 --> 01:04:47.584
Not before the accident.
We used to look up to him.

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:51.459
He was the best footballer on the team.

01:04:51.584 --> 01:04:56.709
And then the ball rolled out in front
of the car on the highway.

01:04:56.834 --> 01:05:00.876
He was gone for six months and when
he returned, he'd turned into a spazz.

01:05:01.001 --> 01:05:04.667
- I told you, kids are a load of crap.
- But why do we make fun of him?

01:05:04.792 --> 01:05:09.584
He never should have chased
that ball on to the goddamn highway.

01:05:11.292 --> 01:05:14.751
Because we're afraid
of Spazzy Bent, Edward.

01:05:14.876 --> 01:05:19.459
We're afraid of kids. We're afraid
they'll run out in front of the cars.

01:05:19.584 --> 01:05:23.084
- Yeah right.
- But he's happy.

01:05:23.209 --> 01:05:27.792
- He dances and he's got a sex life.
- And that's strange.

01:05:27.917 --> 01:05:30.251
And what have we got?

01:05:30.376 --> 01:05:33.917
You want me to throw myself in front
of a car to get laid? That's stupid.

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:37.209
You're not making any goddamn sense.

01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:56.876
Gritt, what are you doing?

01:05:58.292 --> 01:06:00.751
I can't take it anymore.

01:06:00.876 --> 01:06:05.834
I've had it!
No more perverted psychos.

01:06:06.001 --> 01:06:09.001
Are you going to dump her in there?

01:06:09.084 --> 01:06:14.042
We're going to do like the British.
Sweep it under the rug. Gone!

01:06:16.834 --> 01:06:19.542
I want to be normal, Ingrid.

01:06:19.667 --> 01:06:22.542
I miss lb and his potbelly.

01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:26.167
I don't want to go looking for men
who watch PBS -

01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:30.001
- because I know that lb loves me -

01:06:30.084 --> 01:06:36.584
- and you're crazy if you can't see
that we've just got our lines crossed.

01:06:38.251 --> 01:06:43.376
We used to be happy.
Why can't we be happy again?

01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:50.584
I can't take you seriously
if I have to look down on you.

01:06:53.584 --> 01:06:56.584
Give me the shovel, quick!

01:06:56.709 --> 01:07:00.376
You fucking bitches!

01:07:12.126 --> 01:07:15.084
- Hello.
<i>- Igor, this is Edward.</i>

01:07:15.209 --> 01:07:17.459
<i>Can you see the house behind you?</i>

01:07:17.584 --> 01:07:22.042
<i>It's my house. Gritt and Ingrid are
both waiting for you inside, okay?</i>

01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:24.876
- Okay, I kill them?
<i>- No, no!</i>

01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:28.584
No, no, Igor. No kill.
They're happy now, very much.

01:07:28.709 --> 01:07:31.334
<i>You wanted to hear it
from themselves, right?</i>

01:07:33.876 --> 01:07:36.626
Hi, you must be Igor.
I'm Ingrid.

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:39.709
I'm very happy I'm not frigid.
Come in.

01:07:44.167 --> 01:07:48.209
Igor, please sit down and have a drink.

01:07:48.334 --> 01:07:52.626
I'm Gritt, and I'm very happy
and not frigid.

01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:55.751
We are sorry that it's so dark-

01:07:55.876 --> 01:08:00.209
- but we forgot
to pay the electricity bill.

01:08:00.334 --> 01:08:03.792
lb and Edward told us
about the little mistake.

01:08:03.917 --> 01:08:09.584
If you ask me, I don't think
you should kill us. Right, Ingrid?

01:08:12.084 --> 01:08:18.001
You see, Igor, we love our husbands
very, very, very much -

01:08:18.084 --> 01:08:22.626
- but sometimes marriage gets
a little bit tired, you know?

01:08:22.751 --> 01:08:27.584
It's a bit like tide water.
Sometimes the water is high -

01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:30.542
- and sometimes it's low.

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:35.626
And for the last day,
the water has been very, very, very low.

01:08:35.751 --> 01:08:40.459
- I hate water.
- Yes, of course you hate water.

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:43.459
Who doesn't?
Don't you hate water, Ingrid?

01:08:43.584 --> 01:08:46.834
Hate water! I hate water.

01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:50.251
But you see, Igor...

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:54.667
Women have so many feelings.
Their heart is so big -

01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:57.667
- and sometimes it's like
there's a storm inside. A storm, Igor.

01:08:57.792 --> 01:09:01.751
- Shit, lb!
- I remember my first date.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:06.167
I was only 15,
and Sofus his name was.

01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:10.376
I had a good eye to him.
He was in my parallel class.

01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:12.584
And after many, many, many months -

01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:16.542
- finally he asked if I would walk out
and eat pizza with him.

01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:18.167
lb, what the hell are you doing?

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:24.167
I was so nervous and also hungry,
so of course I said yes.

01:09:25.209 --> 01:09:28.834
When he kissed me outside
Pizzeria Milano...

01:09:29.001 --> 01:09:34.709
... I swear my knees were like rubber
and my heart missed a <i>slag.</i>

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:41.501
You probably are the two ugliest
trannies I have ever laid my eyes on.

01:09:41.626 --> 01:09:45.334
I think I am gonna be sick.

01:09:45.459 --> 01:09:50.042
- I agree.
- What are you saying?

01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:57.751
I am saying you both look like retired
Ukrainian hookers in a car crash.

01:09:57.876 --> 01:10:00.209
I'm glad the lights are out.

01:10:00.334 --> 01:10:05.334
- How dare you talk to women like that?
- How dare I?

01:10:05.459 --> 01:10:08.084
- lb, goddammit.
- You are very ugly.

01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:11.167
- Fuck you!
- Please don't.

01:10:15.834 --> 01:10:17.501
No!

01:10:18.292 --> 01:10:24.459
What the hell got into you, lb?
What the hell got into you, man?!

01:10:24.584 --> 01:10:27.376
I won't have him talk
to Gritt like that.

01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:31.542
- You're not Gritt, you're lb!
- Where am I? Is my hair okay?

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:34.209
You're not Gritt, you're lb.
You're a man!

01:10:34.334 --> 01:10:38.626
It was the woman inside me, Edward.
She came thundering out.

01:10:38.751 --> 01:10:42.584
Suddenly I felt breasts,
ovaries and everything.

01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:47.001
Suddenly I'd like to have kids.

01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:53.834
Give it to me. Give it to me.
Give it to me!

01:10:56.501 --> 01:11:00.042
lb, stop looking at me like that.

01:11:00.167 --> 01:11:03.417
We have to get outta here!
We must find the girls.

01:11:03.542 --> 01:11:05.417
We have to put an end to this!

01:11:25.001 --> 01:11:28.626
- Pick up the goddamn phone, Ingrid.
- Ingrid speaking.

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:32.667
- Hi, Ingrid, it's me.
<i>- Hi, Edward.</i>

01:11:32.792 --> 01:11:36.334
Look, we have to meet right away!

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:41.542
- Don't you boss me around.
- Oh, I didn't mean to boss you around.

01:11:41.667 --> 01:11:45.001
You bet you didn't.
You sound so grumpy.

01:11:45.126 --> 01:11:49.626
- No, I'm just a bit stressed out.
- You sound grumpy.

01:11:49.751 --> 01:11:53.709
I know I'm grumpy.
We've been over it like 4,000 times.

01:11:53.834 --> 01:11:57.084
<i>- But it doesn't sink in, does it?</i>
- We have to meet right away.

01:11:57.209 --> 01:11:59.626
Let's meet at the inn, then.

01:11:59.751 --> 01:12:04.167
No, we can't meet there.

01:12:04.292 --> 01:12:06.084
- What's up?
- Be there.

01:12:06.209 --> 01:12:09.334
- We'll meet there. No problem.
<i>- Just be there.</i>

01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:12.626
Goddamn it, lb,
We're meeting at the inn.

01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:15.167
I couldn't... shit.

01:12:15.292 --> 01:12:20.584
Let me out! Fucking bitches!

01:12:24.626 --> 01:12:27.876
- What the hell...?
- What the hell happened to you?

01:12:31.167 --> 01:12:36.751
- Look, we can't talk here.
- This is a fine place to talk.

01:12:36.876 --> 01:12:39.667
You can't hurt us here, you see.

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:42.917
Well, what happened to your killer?

01:12:44.417 --> 01:12:47.001
Yes...

01:12:47.084 --> 01:12:51.251
- You know?
- We know everything.

01:12:51.376 --> 01:12:56.251
As a matter of fact,
we've got Heinz on the phone.

01:12:56.376 --> 01:12:59.376
We told him we felt threatened -

01:12:59.501 --> 01:13:02.376
- so he's ready to move out
if you try anything.

01:13:02.501 --> 01:13:06.042
- Oh, Heinz?
- Right, Gritt?

01:13:22.334 --> 01:13:24.751
Why are you looking like that?

01:13:24.876 --> 01:13:28.376
Maybe you'd like to explain -

01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:34.292
- what the hell is going on
in your sick heads. A hitman?!

01:13:34.417 --> 01:13:39.459
This whole mess with the divorce
and the money just really got to us -

01:13:39.584 --> 01:13:42.376
- and then we did a stupid thing.

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:44.834
It's very human -

01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:50.292
- to mess up and live to regret it.

01:13:50.417 --> 01:13:55.459
Maybe it's subconscious.
You do something against your will.

01:13:55.584 --> 01:13:58.167
You want to do something -

01:13:58.292 --> 01:14:00.542
- but you don't want to after all.

01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:03.001
We know what subconscious means.

01:14:03.126 --> 01:14:07.834
We'd never kill you
on account of alimony.

01:14:08.001 --> 01:14:10.167
Nobody deserves to die. Not you either.

01:14:10.292 --> 01:14:14.251
- Do you want me to call the police?
- Mind your own business, will you?

01:14:14.376 --> 01:14:19.417
- Aren't they threatening to kill you?
- Do we look dead? No, right?

01:14:19.542 --> 01:14:24.334
- Ingrid, you'd better keep it down.
- You don't discuss killing your wife.

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:28.251
- We're discussing them considering it.
- Well, you don't consider it either.

01:14:28.376 --> 01:14:33.001
So none of you have ever had
forbidden thoughts?

01:14:33.126 --> 01:14:36.626
If only you could blow the head off the
guy who cuts you off at the crossing -

01:14:36.751 --> 01:14:39.334
- or the guy blocking the escalator.

01:14:39.459 --> 01:14:43.834
Or your husband who always forgets your
anniversary and gives you a blender.

01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:49.459
Or when you're busy and stuck
in the line at the supermarket -

01:14:49.584 --> 01:14:52.876
- I'm just saying, that makes
some of us think certain thoughts.

01:14:53.001 --> 01:14:56.834
- But not you.
- That blender works like a dream.

01:14:57.001 --> 01:15:00.542
No, you're so polite and you've
got your head so far up your ass -

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:03.001
- you can look out through your throat.

01:15:10.834 --> 01:15:13.501
Don't drink any more!

01:15:17.292 --> 01:15:19.167
- She's here.
- Get out!

01:15:24.876 --> 01:15:28.667
- It's flat! They're all flat!
- Run!

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:33.167
- They're all flat.
- Taxi! Taxi!

01:15:39.251 --> 01:15:40.417
Go!

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:49.209
I don't think
you look very happy tonight.

01:15:56.001 --> 01:15:58.042
What is wrong with you people?

01:16:00.334 --> 01:16:04.376
You have no problems.
You have no problems.

01:16:04.501 --> 01:16:08.626
My mother and father in Murmansk
far away, they have problems.

01:16:08.751 --> 01:16:12.292
They live together for 50 years.
They are married for 50 years -

01:16:12.417 --> 01:16:15.542
- but they still kiss.

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:21.126
They have problems, they fight.
She hit him, he fall, she pick him up.

01:16:21.251 --> 01:16:26.709
But they love each other, they kiss
each other, they fuck each other.

01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:31.834
She's very, very big woman,
and he has a very, very small dick.

01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:37.417
But you know, a little tiny fuck
is always better than no fuck.

01:16:37.542 --> 01:16:43.376
And you have everything. You have
woman, man, car, house, money.

01:16:43.501 --> 01:16:46.501
You have everything,
but you have no fuck!

01:16:46.626 --> 01:16:51.001
Edward... Edward?
What are you doing, Edward?

01:16:51.751 --> 01:16:55.001
Sit.
Sit down, Edward.

01:17:01.292 --> 01:17:07.001
I really like you guys, but it just
makes me so sad when I see sad people.

01:17:07.126 --> 01:17:10.667
Hello, Igor?
You're alright, you're okay.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:15.876
You talk about being happy
all the time -

01:17:16.001 --> 01:17:20.001
- but are you happy, Igor?
Where is love in your life?

01:17:20.126 --> 01:17:25.709
I think you just kill people
because they're like you. Unhappy.

01:17:27.001 --> 01:17:30.792
You really think this is some kind
of stupid movie moment?

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:36.042
Yes, Igor. This is where
the good guy talks to the bad guy -

01:17:36.167 --> 01:17:41.334
- and he makes him realize
that he's totally wrong.

01:17:41.459 --> 01:17:44.001
I haven't seen that work in a movie.

01:17:44.084 --> 01:17:47.542
Then you haven't seen many, many movies.

01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:51.042
- There's many, many, many movies...
- Name one.

01:17:54.584 --> 01:17:58.459
Okay, Igor, then try this one.

01:17:58.584 --> 01:18:03.042
Have you ever given it a thought
that maybe people are unhappy -

01:18:03.167 --> 01:18:07.709
- just before you're going to kill them,
because you are going to kill them?

01:18:08.584 --> 01:18:11.917
Maybe that makes them
just a tiny little bit unhappy.

01:18:12.042 --> 01:18:17.459
Think that might just play a tiny little
fucking role, huh, you stupid Russian?

01:18:18.876 --> 01:18:22.459
Okay, Edward, now you tell me -

01:18:22.584 --> 01:18:24.667
- or I will kill you.

01:18:24.792 --> 01:18:27.792
When was the last time
you made your woman happy?

01:18:27.917 --> 01:18:31.459
There's never any time! She's going to
her goddamn salsa lessons all the time.

01:18:31.584 --> 01:18:33.334
Oh, cut it out!

01:18:39.542 --> 01:18:42.042
- Now we have a little time.
- What?

01:18:42.167 --> 01:18:45.709
So try to make her happy, Edward.

01:18:49.876 --> 01:18:54.001
- Well, what do you want me to say?
- Christ, you're romantic!

01:18:54.126 --> 01:18:58.292
- Say something to her.
- Sure.

01:18:58.417 --> 01:19:00.459
Sure...

01:19:00.584 --> 01:19:03.251
Ingrid, I think you're hot.

01:19:03.376 --> 01:19:07.209
And I think
it's a waste of tits and ass...

01:19:07.334 --> 01:19:11.459
- Holy crap!
- At least pretend I'm making you happy!

01:19:11.584 --> 01:19:15.459
He doesn't understand Danish.
Or would you rather die?

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:19.292
Edward, try to talk about her eyes.

01:19:22.126 --> 01:19:26.834
Yes, well... Your eyes are so...

01:19:27.001 --> 01:19:30.501
Sure, your eyes are...

01:19:31.251 --> 01:19:33.792
... round and blue.

01:19:33.917 --> 01:19:37.084
Grey, green, no, brown.

01:19:37.209 --> 01:19:39.584
- They're blue-grey, you idiot!
- Shit!

01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:44.626
Ingrid, you're always on my mind.
You're with me all the time.

01:19:46.834 --> 01:19:52.251
And it's not your ass I see, but your
eyes, because they're really special -

01:19:52.376 --> 01:19:57.792
- your eyes are.
Both deep and... naughty.

01:19:57.917 --> 01:20:00.792
You have very intense eyes.

01:20:00.917 --> 01:20:05.876
I don't understand
why you're with a grump like me.

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:09.876
But then you aren't anymore.

01:20:11.167 --> 01:20:16.001
All I know is
that for the rest of my life -

01:20:16.126 --> 01:20:19.417
- I'll remember those eyes.

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:26.292
But then that's only
a couple of minutes.

01:20:26.417 --> 01:20:29.376
I'm sorry, darling.

01:20:29.501 --> 01:20:33.917
Oh, Edward,
I don't want anybody else than you.

01:20:34.042 --> 01:20:37.542
If only you were someone else.

01:20:45.584 --> 01:20:47.876
That was beautiful.

01:20:48.001 --> 01:20:52.001
Edward, you make us happy.

01:20:59.042 --> 01:21:01.167
Igor?

01:21:04.209 --> 01:21:08.876
<i>Cyanide... 30 seconds.
And nothing...</i>

01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:12.417
Haven't tasted such shitty vodka
since I was eight.

01:21:40.542 --> 01:21:41.751
No!

01:21:55.376 --> 01:21:57.001
No!

01:22:16.751 --> 01:22:19.584
The word salsa!

01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:25.376
Some say it comes from the sound
the Cuban musicians made -

01:22:25.501 --> 01:22:28.584
- while they played.

01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:35.251
Others claim it's because
salsa is a blend of many styles.

01:22:35.376 --> 01:22:40.542
Like the salsa sauce.
A little bit of everything.

01:22:40.667 --> 01:22:46.084
A little soft, a little sweet,
a little spicy.

01:22:46.209 --> 01:22:51.459
Like life itself.
We love, we hate.

01:22:51.584 --> 01:22:54.876
We fight -

01:22:55.001 --> 01:22:56.501
- and we kiss.

01:23:56.126 --> 01:23:59.709
Shit, I hate this.
It just isn't me at all.

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:03.209
It's a load of bull.
These clothes are too tight.

01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:07.042
They're not intended to be worn.
They make you look stupid.

01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:09.542
It's not me at all.

01:24:09.667 --> 01:24:13.459
- Well, Gritt and I are off now.
- Already?

01:24:13.584 --> 01:24:16.042
Gritt's ovaries hurt.

01:24:16.167 --> 01:24:19.042
You're brave.
What about nuchal folds?

01:24:19.167 --> 01:24:23.542
With or without nuchal folds.
Ovulation in an hour.

01:25:14.501 --> 01:25:19.042
So, you finally finished
the Great Wall of China, huh?

01:25:19.167 --> 01:25:21.459
No need for sarcasm.

01:25:21.584 --> 01:25:26.417
- How are things with the girls at home?
- Just fine, Mrs. Hansen.

01:25:26.542 --> 01:25:30.876
It sure sounds like
you're boring in bed.

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:36.001
- But, Mrs. Hansen...
- Time for a screwdriver!

01:25:37.501 --> 01:25:41.709
Oh dear.
Give me a hand, will you?

01:25:41.834 --> 01:25:44.667
As for your women...

01:25:44.792 --> 01:25:49.042
Men don't understand
it's all about the clitoris.

01:25:49.167 --> 01:25:51.417
Most can't even find it.

01:25:51.542 --> 01:25:55.417
And not only my late Poul,
but all my lovers.

01:25:55.542 --> 01:25:57.667
Couldn't find it.

01:25:57.792 --> 01:26:03.042
Searched for it like
it was the Higgs Boson in Switzerland.

01:26:03.167 --> 01:26:06.709
They kept licking away
in all the wrong places.

01:26:06.834 --> 01:26:13.459
No, I won't climax
if you put my big toe in your mouth!

01:26:13.584 --> 01:26:17.042
How about I show you how it's done?

01:26:17.167 --> 01:26:20.459
We could all go lie on the sofa.

01:26:20.584 --> 01:26:24.001
My crawl space could do
with a nice makeover.

01:26:24.876 --> 01:26:28.167
Let's just settle the bill later,
Mrs. Hansen.

01:27:19.084 --> 01:27:22.084
