00:13.888 --> 00:15.056
Boys.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.558
Hey, Julian.
Where have you been?

00:16.641 --> 00:18.977
I was just...
running around, man.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.979
Okay, well, I think
this is the final tweak.

00:21.062 --> 00:21.938
No way.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.940
I think this is
the final tweak right here.

00:24.023 --> 00:25.442
I just want to make a toast

00:26.025 --> 00:28.653
to the two best friends
and the two best business partners

00:28.737 --> 00:30.447
a guy could ever have.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.283
Let this be the final one.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.951
-Here, Ricky.
-Looks pretty clear, man.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.162
-Thanks, buddy.
-Oh, it's clear. It's clear as fuck.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.788
-It smells fucking good.
-[exhalation]

00:38.872 --> 00:40.498
All right!
Let's try it out.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.791
-[Bubbles] Come on, baby.
-Excited.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.959
Come on, baby.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.796
Holy fuck, that's smooth, man!

00:47.046 --> 00:48.715
That is fucking delicious!

00:48.798 --> 00:49.924
-Yes!
-Awesome!

00:50.008 --> 00:51.134
Yes!

00:51.468 --> 00:53.678
I've been workin' with Ricky and Julian
non-stop on this beer

00:53.762 --> 00:56.097
and I've gotta say it's been
the greatest time of my life.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.808
There's no illegal stuff,
no fucking bullshit;

00:58.892 --> 01:00.685
everybody's
pulling their weight.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.688
The boys actually kept
their fucking word.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.024
[voice breaking] And I've never been
more proud of them.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.942
It's been really, really hard
not breaking the law,

01:08.026 --> 01:10.403
but we promised Bubbles we wouldn't
and we're sticking to it.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.614
Other than picking a few magic mushrooms
under the trailers and...

01:12.697 --> 01:13.823
[exhaling]

01:13.907 --> 01:15.992
...selling them for a bit
of grocery money here and there,

01:16.076 --> 01:17.786
I'm 100% on the straight of narrow.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.621
And it feels really
good not having secrets.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.998
I mean, well, other than
what I just told you guys,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.875
but... just keep
that to yourselves.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.710
[Julian] It's been actually pretty
cool working for Bubs

01:25.794 --> 01:28.755
and, you know, just sitting back
and letting him run things for once.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.715
I've been working
as a sales rep,

01:30.799 --> 01:33.426
and... I don't mean to sound
like I'm bragging or anything,

01:33.510 --> 01:35.553
but I just locked in
a deal with the Legion

01:35.637 --> 01:36.971
to supply them with beer

01:37.055 --> 01:39.265
for the provincial dart
championship coming up.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.725
That's 60 cases.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.061
I mean, that's fucking
massive for us.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.355
And I did it. Hm.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.982
To Julian, and to 60 cases!

01:48.066 --> 01:50.735
Let this be the start of many more
fucking deals to come!

01:50.819 --> 01:52.237
-Fuck yeah.
-Way to go, Julian!

01:52.320 --> 01:54.864
Boys, it's not just me, okay?
It's all of us. We're a team.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.492
We should probably fucking include
Big Hawk in this too.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.244
[laughing] The guy you did
the deal with,

01:59.327 --> 02:01.037
that's his fucking name
or is that a nickname?

02:01.121 --> 02:04.040
-It's his fucking nickname, obviously.
-Well, it's a fucked name either way.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.250
All right, to Big Hawk!

02:05.333 --> 02:06.334
All right.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.255
-Big Hawk.
-Fuck that is smooth. That's like a...

02:10.338 --> 02:12.465
[Julian] Boys, speaking of names,
I've been thinking about this

02:12.549 --> 02:14.134
all fucking night, you know.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.760
Check this out...

02:16.136 --> 02:17.554
Freedom 35.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.431
-That's what the beer should be called.
-[Ricky scoffing]

02:20.515 --> 02:21.683
No, think, boys.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.810
It's something we've been trying
to achieve our entire lives

02:23.893 --> 02:25.395
and because of this fucking beer,

02:25.478 --> 02:27.564
I think we're finally gonna
make it this time.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.400
-It's perfect.
-No, it's dumb. It's a dumb fucking name.

02:30.483 --> 02:33.236
It's not a dumb name, Ricky.
Dumb's not the word.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.697
But, Julian, it's fucking huge decision.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.657
So you know,
maybe we should think about it,

02:37.740 --> 02:40.535
get consensus amongst
the board of directors.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.495
It's actually kind of too late.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.913
I think it's fucking perfect.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.790
Here, check these out.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.792
Holy fuck!

02:47.876 --> 02:49.752
-[Ricky] Those are nice.
-That's the logo?

02:49.836 --> 02:52.380
[Julian] And... check out this shirt,
buddy.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.591
Oh...

02:54.799 --> 02:56.593
We have uniforms, boys.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.928
-[Bubbles] It's got my name on it!
-Yep.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.723
I never had a shirt
with my name on it before.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.224
That's fucking badass.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.184
Decent!

03:05.435 --> 03:07.520
-You know what, Julian?
-What?

03:08.396 --> 03:09.939
-I do love it.
-Thank you.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.733
-I think it's fucking perfect.
-So do I.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.110
Freedom 35, that's the name.
I love it!

03:14.193 --> 03:17.322
If you guys like it, I guess,
but, if it's gonna have a shitty name,

03:17.405 --> 03:19.324
it's gonna have to have
a fucking kick-ass fucking slogan.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.034
I already thought of that.
Check this out:

03:21.492 --> 03:23.912
"Freedom 35. Drink the dream."

03:23.995 --> 03:26.623
Oh yeah, that's really fucking catchy.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.957
-It's not...
-What?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.375
[Bubbles] It's not bad, Ricky.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.211
But you know, Julian,
I think slogans should...

03:32.629 --> 03:34.881
be a little more, you know, developed.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.132
How about this?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.634
"Freedom 35.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.261
This is what freedom tastes like."

03:40.345 --> 03:41.554
-Eh?
-All right, okay...

03:41.638 --> 03:43.139
That's gonna look good on the box.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.183
No, they both fucking suck, actually.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.976
You guys clearly know
nothing about markeling.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.770
Okay, what do you
fucking think then, genius?

03:48.853 --> 03:50.897
It's just got to be...
simple and basic.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.691
Like... all right.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.401
"Freedom 35.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.237
Drink our beer."

03:57.445 --> 03:59.489
-It's kind of right on the nose.
-[Ricky gurgling, spitting]

03:59.572 --> 04:00.573
-Ricky!
-Ricky!

04:00.657 --> 04:01.616
Fuck!

04:01.699 --> 04:03.493
Here, you're getting it
on your uniform.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.411
All over my new uniform!

04:05.495 --> 04:07.247
All over my fucking joint!

04:08.498 --> 04:10.458
Now it's gotta be laundered.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.962
[theme music]

04:52.792 --> 04:54.711
-Do you like it hard or soft?
-Ricky!

04:54.794 --> 04:56.462
Hard or soft?

04:56.546 --> 04:58.464
-Would you fuck off?
-Was that too much?

04:58.548 --> 05:01.217
-I'm just fucking around, Bubs.
-I'm trying to fucking focus here.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.262
Okay, no, I'm not gonna bug you.
It's all good.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.514
Rick, put the beer cock down
and stop fucking around, okay?

05:06.597 --> 05:08.099
We've got a big day ahead of us.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.976
-We all need to be focused.
-No shit!

05:10.059 --> 05:12.061
Don't worry about me.
I'm fucking razor-focused, bud.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.062
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.230
What's the plan, then?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.649
We gotta get all the fucking shit
done, boys! Yeah!

05:16.733 --> 05:18.776
Wrong. Just to be clear again,

05:18.860 --> 05:20.987
we've gotta go to Reggie's,
pick up all the bottles,

05:21.070 --> 05:22.822
-get back here, do all the bottling...
-I know.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.533
...all the labelling,
and get to the Legion for 5:00

05:25.616 --> 05:28.119
or else Big Hawk's gonna be
pissed off, and so will I.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.245
So let's get this done.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.872
That's pretty much
what I fucking said, Julian.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.123
No, it isn't.

05:32.206 --> 05:34.292
-You all set, Bubs?
-Yes. Just remember,

05:34.375 --> 05:36.377
I've got no power steering,
no power brakes.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.087
Take it fucking easy.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.132
We were able to buy my truck
back from the pawn shop,

05:41.215 --> 05:43.134
except the dirty cocksucker
that runs the place

05:43.217 --> 05:45.303
sold the goddamn
engine out of it.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.096
But, not a big deal.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.682
You know, if the business
keeps growing the way it has been,

05:49.766 --> 05:52.769
I'll be able to put a brand
new engine in it someday.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.604
Hopefully.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.023
-Here we go.
-[engine roaring]

05:57.356 --> 06:00.193
Ricky, Ricky!
Slow the fuck down...

06:00.818 --> 06:02.987
All right, and we're off.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.948
[singing William Tell Overture]

06:06.574 --> 06:09.368
Randy, you've got to admit, bud,
you've got a gift.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.996
And I'm telling you,
we go back to that track,

06:12.080 --> 06:13.706
you use your old fucking noggin,

06:13.790 --> 06:17.126
we're gonna win back
all the money we lost, bud.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.796
We? You lost the money.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.380
We talked about this.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.299
We're never going back
to the track again.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.551
If you go back to the track,
you're gonna lose.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.887
At the horses and me, Mr. Lahey.

06:29.388 --> 06:30.723
Randy...

06:30.807 --> 06:32.016
[George] Gentlemen!

06:33.434 --> 06:34.811
I took the liberty of...

06:34.894 --> 06:37.063
making a few purchases,
for the company.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.231
I see.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.943
We're gonna have to up the surveillance
if we're gonna take those guys down.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.362
Who said anything about
taking those guys down?

06:44.445 --> 06:46.864
Since Julian got out,
they haven't even been frigging with us.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.575
Sorry. Am I missing something here?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.452
Yeah, George, maybe
you are missing something.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.955
'Cause every time
we kick the old shit hive,

06:54.038 --> 06:57.083
the old fucking shit bees
swarm the shit out of us.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.668
Yeah. George,
we're really not interested.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.670
-Just let them make their beer.
-Please.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.421
Tell me you two don't
actually believe

07:02.505 --> 07:04.966
that all they're doing down there
is making beer?

07:05.049 --> 07:07.635
Please tell me
you're not that stupid!

07:09.178 --> 07:11.514
You're always talking about shit, Jim.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.684
Why don't you wake the fuck up
and smell it for once?

07:14.767 --> 07:16.436
Goddamn idiots!

07:19.480 --> 07:21.107
We've got a problem, Rands.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.733
What the fuck is that?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.069
I don't know, it's some kind of...

07:25.153 --> 07:26.446
robot thingy.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.248
Hey, the Reg! 'Sup, buddy?

07:37.331 --> 07:39.959
Ricky! How you doing,
you old ostrich fucker?

07:40.042 --> 07:41.544
-[Julian chuckles]
-Please tell me

07:41.627 --> 07:44.005
you are packing some of those
fucking mushrooms, bro.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.590
I got so fucked up on those things,

07:45.673 --> 07:47.425
I could have sucked the cock
off a crocodile.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.594
-[Ricky clearing throat]
-What mushrooms are you talking about?

07:49.677 --> 07:51.596
'Shrooms? Must have got those
from somebody else.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.806
I haven't had 'shrooms
in a fucking long time. Like, years.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.018
[Julian] Think we can grab those fucking
bottles? We're in a bit of a rush, Reg.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.520
-Yeah. No bottles.
-What?

07:59.604 --> 08:01.147
Crushed the shit out
of those bottles.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.316
What? What the fuck do you mean?

08:03.399 --> 08:05.318
Yeah, I was tripping on them 'shrooms,
bro, and I...

08:05.401 --> 08:07.737
I got on the old
front-end loader and, uh...

08:07.820 --> 08:10.531
well, I was like a Tyrannosaurus rex
fucking a goat up there.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.283
-[Ricky laughing]
-Pretty much trashed the whole yard.

08:12.366 --> 08:15.703
Oh, yeah? Okay,
so we're fucked then! This is great.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.039
Oh, you know...
calm down, buddy.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.041
I mean. I feel slightly
responsible here. It's...

08:20.124 --> 08:21.834
Why don't you go up
to the recycling people?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.628
They've got a shit-ton
of bottles up there.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.379
Jesus Christ, Reg,
we were coming to you

08:25.463 --> 08:28.049
because you said you'd front them
and we'd get you back later.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.134
This is fucking great, Julian!
This is great.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.845
There's no way we can do this
by 5:00 now! We're fucked!

08:32.929 --> 08:35.222
Hey, hey, calm down.
We can still do it on 5:00.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.015
[panting] How, Ricky?

08:37.099 --> 08:39.059
A fucking good, old-fashioned
bottle drive, that's how.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.729
I'll round up my hockey kids.
We can fucking do this.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.858
Okay. Let's go, Julian.
Let's get it going. Right now.

08:45.942 --> 08:46.859
-Okay.
-Let's go.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.529
-Bottle drive.
-Ride with me. We'll figure this out.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.447
So dude, seriously.
[clearing throat]

08:51.531 --> 08:53.658
You can get your hands
on some of those mushrooms though?

08:53.741 --> 08:55.284
[coughs]
I've got a shit-ton of them.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.869
I've gotta keep it
on the fucking down low.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.080
I've got some guys.
We can move that shit, buddy.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.666
-Let's do a deal. Come on.
-I can't do it. Like, it's...

09:01.749 --> 09:03.292
it's kind of like
my retirement or whatever.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.545
I can sell a little for
some money when I need it, but...

09:05.628 --> 09:07.880
I can't get into anything illegal.
I promised Bubbles.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.715
-Tiger teabaggin'...
-[Bubbles] Honk, honk!

09:09.799 --> 09:12.510
-I'm coming!
-Let's go, Ricky! You said bottle drive,

09:12.593 --> 09:15.304
not bottle sit-in-the-fucking-junkyard-
where-there's-no-bottles!

09:15.388 --> 09:16.305
I get it.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.725
'Cause your fucking crazy friend
smashed them, high on mushrooms!

09:19.809 --> 09:21.269
[sigh]

09:21.352 --> 09:23.980
All right, look, if you change your mind,
I got some Japanese.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.566
They will pay top yen
for this kind of good shit.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.859
-Don't forget that.
-Top what?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.069
Top yen, baby.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.489
Top yen. It's good yen.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.907
-Top yen?
-Yen's good.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.117
-What's a top...
-Top yen.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.243
-Okay.
-Yung chow yen.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.911
[Bubbles] Hon-n-n-nk!

09:41.747 --> 09:44.125
Seriously, tiger teabaggin' fucker.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.835
You know what "can't"
means to Reggie?

09:45.918 --> 09:47.712
-What?
-It means "can."

09:51.591 --> 09:52.800
[engine ignition]

09:53.217 --> 09:55.011
[Ricky] All right kids,
let's get some bottles.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.887
And follow my leaf,
let me do the talking,

09:56.971 --> 09:58.681
'cause rich people are fucked.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.349
[knocking at door]

10:02.018 --> 10:03.728
How you doing, darling?
We're on a bottle drive,

10:03.811 --> 10:05.730
trying to raise some money
for these poor little girls.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.732
They need braces.
Their teeth are fucked.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.734
Got anything you can
help us out with?

10:09.817 --> 10:11.861
-No! Please get off my property.
-What the fuck?

10:11.944 --> 10:13.738
-[door closing]
-Thanks for your cock-sucking support!

10:13.821 --> 10:15.740
Fucking rich people.
They make me sick!

10:15.823 --> 10:16.782
[Julian knocking at door]

10:18.326 --> 10:20.578
Hey, bud. I'm just raising
money for the kids.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.955
Uh, do you got any empty beer bottles
kicking around?

10:23.039 --> 10:24.749
-[man grunts]
-No? What about full ones?

10:24.832 --> 10:25.750
Mm-hmm.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.543
You got any fucking booze here
that you don't want?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.544
-Mm-hmm.
-No?

10:28.628 --> 10:29.545
[Bubbles] Oh, for fuck's sakes!

10:29.629 --> 10:31.922
-Fuck off, then.
-That sucks.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.341
-Julian.
-What?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.384
We're trying to get empty bottles,

10:35.468 --> 10:36.969
not bottles of liquor.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.639
Bubs, I didn't know this was gonna
take so fucking long, okay?

10:39.722 --> 10:42.016
Let's just move it on
to the next house. Let's go.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.188
How's it going? I'm just doing a little
bottle drive, trying to get some empties.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.774
We're actually trying to raise money
for little Darren here. He needs eyes.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.360
They're falling out. He caughtched
a disease. You got anything here?

10:52.443 --> 10:54.278
[woman] No, sorry. Can't help you.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.366
-This blows.
-This isn't working.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.201
I know, because everyone
in this fucking neighbourhood

11:00.284 --> 11:02.662
is a fucking asshole!

11:03.621 --> 11:06.290
A full case! Aren't you just
a little angel sent from heaven.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.708
Thank you, ma'am.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.794
[girl] You have yourself
a wonderful day.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.380
All right. Let's go.

-[box creaking]

11:13.839 --> 11:17.927
-[glass shattering]
-You s... stupid son of a...

11:18.010 --> 11:20.846
-[woman] I'll just go grab a broom.
-Sorry, it was an accident!

11:20.930 --> 11:23.641
No, I didn't mean you.
I meant the box.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.559
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-[clinking]

11:25.643 --> 11:27.686
Sorry about that.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.148
It's not a big deal. Let's just...
let's just go.

11:32.566 --> 11:33.484

-[dog barking]

11:36.153 --> 11:38.447
How's it going?
Just on a little bottle drive here,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.116
trying to raise some money
for little Darren.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.911
He needs a new heart, new lungs,
new veins. It's a mess.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.705
My organs are totally fucked.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.916
That's right.
Can you help us out?

11:49.834 --> 11:51.544
-Pathetic. What are you doing?
-Oh, that's nice.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.671
That's just fucking...
What the fuck is wrong

11:53.754 --> 11:56.340
with the people
in this fucking neighbourhood?

11:56.799 --> 11:59.468
[Julian] We got fuck all, Bubs.
How'd you guys make out?

11:59.552 --> 12:02.263
Well, not good, Julian. I mean,
what are we gonna do here?

12:02.346 --> 12:05.307
There's no way we're gonna get enough
to bottle up 60 cases.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.643
This neighbourhood
sucks buffalo balls.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.938
We could be screwed here.
It's a lot harder than it used to be.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.566
Do any of your dads
fucking drink a lot, kids?

12:13.649 --> 12:16.944
Oh! My dad's an alcoholic,
and both of my uncles are too!

12:17.027 --> 12:18.320
They live with us.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.824
-Do you have a lot of empties there?
-Yeah, the whole shed's full!

12:21.907 --> 12:23.492
-Ah...
-Oh, my God.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.287
Ronnie, there's only one word right now
that works for me to call you

12:26.370 --> 12:28.247
and I'm not allowed
to use that word anymore.

12:28.330 --> 12:32.293
I'm gonna have to make up a new one.
Are you fucking de-tarded?

12:32.376 --> 12:34.753
You can't say that.
It still means the same thing!

12:34.837 --> 12:37.298
It means the same thing
but it's not a bad word, right?

12:37.381 --> 12:40.092
Well, then in that case,
you're ducked in the head.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.178
That means fucked
in the head, dummy.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.513
Okay. I know what it is.
Everybody shut the fuck up.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.640
Get the fuck in the cars.
We're getting out of here.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.851
[girl] My God, the language.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.228
[Ricky] Where the fuck
do you live, Ronnie?

12:51.770 --> 12:54.023
[Bubbles] Holy fuck, we did it boys,
we did it.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.025
Fucking rights, we did.
Look at all these fucking things.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.277
There has to be enough here
for 60 cases, isn't there?

12:58.360 --> 13:01.864
60? Ricky, we could make 80 cases
with the bottles here.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.324
You had the fucking idea.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.534
-You saved the day, bud.
-Fucking right, buddy.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.203
No matter how fucked things get,

13:07.286 --> 13:09.497
if you just use your brain,
you can accomplish anything.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.957
Yeah. Just be careful, Ricky.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.168
I got this.
Top of my game, buddy.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.544
Ricky! Ricky!

13:15.628 --> 13:17.213
[clattering]

13:18.130 --> 13:19.381
Jesus Murph... Ricky!

13:19.465 --> 13:21.550
[Ricky] Who the fuck built
those steps all crooked?

13:21.634 --> 13:25.429
You went down like the ten chocolate
layer cakes guy from Sesame Street.

13:25.804 --> 13:28.349
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. A little dizzy though, boys.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.560
And my fucking head feels like it's
sweating all of a sudden for some reason.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.812
-Ricky...
-Still got my fucking joint though.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.814
-Ricky...
-Holy fuck.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.651
-[grunting]
-Ricky... uh-oh.

13:38.734 --> 13:42.446
That's fucking weird.
Why the fuck is my sweat red, boys?

13:42.530 --> 13:45.241
I'm gonna have to go...
take a piss or something.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.825
-Ricky...
-[thud]

13:48.452 --> 13:50.829
Good job, Ronnie.
Keep 'em flowing.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.748
Normally I wouldn't allow the kids

13:52.831 --> 13:55.751
anywhere near the open
liquor bottling stage like this.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.254
But a lot of the bottles
we got from Ronnie's place,

13:58.337 --> 13:59.964
they're full of old cigarette butts

14:00.047 --> 14:03.342
and loogies, even
[whispering] prophylactics.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.637
So I just thought it was better to just
put Cory and Jacob on that station.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.432
This beer's fucking delicious.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.476
Jesus Murphy!

14:12.977 --> 14:16.772
Can you guys not show that, please?
Maybe just cut that off?

14:19.859 --> 14:22.403
We're gonna have to hurry up
with this. We're running out of time here.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.405
Can you just hold still, please?

14:24.488 --> 14:26.782
-This isn't working.
-It's still bleeding, Dad.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.494
It's just a little cut. Jacob, hurry the
fuck up with the duct tape, would you?

14:31.078 --> 14:33.497
Here, Ricky. I don't think
it's gonna stop the bleeding though.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.999
Correct. It won't, Jacob.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.792
Gonna have to borrow
part of your shirt too, bud.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.211
-Good thinking, dude.
-Nice.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.215

14:43.299 --> 14:47.219
[Ricky] Hey! Well, if it isn't three of
the most fucked people in the world!

14:47.303 --> 14:48.762
[Tommy] Hey, Ricky!

14:48.846 --> 14:51.307
Long time no fucking see, man.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.767
What the fuck are you
doing with that Band-Aid?

14:53.851 --> 14:55.936
[Ricky] Just getting ready
to ram it right up your ass.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.106
Hey, word on the street, man, is you're...
sitting on a shit-ton of 'shroomies.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.733
-Now, is that true?
-Is that right?

15:00.816 --> 15:04.111
Well, I'm standing as you can fucking see,
so I guess it's not true, is it?

15:04.194 --> 15:06.238
[laughs] That's cute, man,
but you see, Reggie told me.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.615
He says you got a whole bunch.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.742
We'd be real interested
to take them off your hands,

15:09.825 --> 15:12.453
-if you know what I mean.
-No idea what you're talking about, bud.

15:12.536 --> 15:15.247
Are you saying Reggie's a liar?
Is that what you're fucking saying here?

15:15.331 --> 15:17.249
No. I said I don't know what the fuck
he's talking about.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.043
-Call it whatever the fuck you want.
-Look man,

15:19.126 --> 15:21.253
will you just fucking listen to me
for a second, all right?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.672
Now Terry and Dennis here
got a really good connection

15:23.756 --> 15:26.842
back in J-A-fucking-pan, man,
and we wanna make 'em happy.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.136
So if you are sitting
on a shit-ton of 'shroomies,

15:29.219 --> 15:32.389
let's say it'd be in your best interest
to work out a deal with us now.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.976
Really? Okay. How about this deal:
get the fuck back in your car

15:36.060 --> 15:38.687
and fuck the fuck off
to wherever you fucked on from.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.273
-All right. That's what we'll do.
-Perfect.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.858
-No problem, man.
-All right.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.860
No problem at all.
It's very unfortunate for you,

15:44.944 --> 15:47.154
but not a big fucking deal, Ricky.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.296
Fuck, George, this is really impressive!

16:04.588 --> 16:06.215
I think we can be pretty confident

16:06.298 --> 16:08.133
that there's something
illegal going on there.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.718
Wouldn't you say, guys?

16:09.802 --> 16:10.970
We don't know that for sure.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.889
Plus we already told you
that we're not interested if they are.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.182
Right.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.185
That's Tommy Rector,
aka Tommy Bean, but...

16:20.854 --> 16:22.314
Well, I do.

Well, let's see
where they're going, shall we?

out of the park?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.913

be following them out of the park, Ge--

Yep. And Dennis and Terry
were with him too.

I had a shit-ton of mushrooms.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.016
Okay, boys,
we're ready to rock.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.184
Nice.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.270
Look, I know I keep getting emotional
and everything, but...

17:43.520 --> 17:46.190
-let's go with the hugs.
-Bubs, we don't have time for hugs.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.192
-We've gotta get going, man.
-Nope, don't care.

17:48.275 --> 17:51.695
Love you guys, and I want hugs
and I'm not ashamed to say it.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.613
[whimpering]

17:52.696 --> 17:54.114
-Thanks for everything, boys.
-All right.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.158
I'm fucking proud of you, guys
and I mean that.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.037
-[low] We gotta fucking talk.
-About what?

18:00.913 --> 18:01.830
-Julian.
-What?

18:01.914 --> 18:04.083
Into the buddy mobile, please.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.835
-Are you serious?
-You're ridin' with me. Yeah, let's go.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.045
Come on.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.883
Best buddies.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.636
Going to make a big deal.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.430
-[engine revving]
-Easy, Ricky, easy, easy!

18:18.514 --> 18:19.515
[Julian] Easy!

18:21.683 --> 18:25.104
Honest to fuck, Julian,
I can barely contain myself.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.147
I mean, our lives
are so perfect now,

18:27.231 --> 18:30.067
and they're only gonna get perfecter,
as Ricky would say.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.985
Yeah, well, shit can always go
wrong though, buddy.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.571
-We've got to stay on top of things.
-What? What do you mean?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.240
What do you think's
gonna go wrong?

18:36.323 --> 18:37.866
I don't think anything's
gonna go wrong.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.953
I'm just saying,
shit can always be perfecter.

18:41.036 --> 18:44.248
Well, yeah, obviously.
I mean, if I had an engine in this thing,

18:44.331 --> 18:46.083
-that would make things better.
-[engine roaring]

18:46.166 --> 18:49.336
Dude, I can't imagine if I went out
with a dog. That's kind of weird.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.629
[Ricky] Well, you know what, Cory?

18:50.712 --> 18:53.549
Then better to be safe than sorry
and never fucking date a dog.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.717
[Cory] No, I mean,
if I fell in love with it,

18:55.801 --> 18:59.054
I guess I could, but I don't know.
I just don't think I would though.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.390
[Jacob] Can we stop the...
so I can take a piss?

19:01.473 --> 19:03.892
Oh, my God. Why the fuck
did I even bring you guys?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.269
-[gunfire, glass shattering]
-What the fuck?

19:05.352 --> 19:06.937
-Holy fuck!
-[gunshot]

19:07.020 --> 19:09.356
Jesus Christ, somebody's
shooting at us!

19:09.439 --> 19:11.150
Julian, what the fuck is that?

19:13.068 --> 19:15.487
Tommy Bean! Oh, for fuck's sakes!

19:15.571 --> 19:16.905
Do you got any guns up there?

19:18.699 --> 19:20.492
I've got one with me...

19:20.576 --> 19:23.912
Uhh... I've got one under the seat
and there's a shotgun in the trunk.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.290
Well, pull over! We've gotta fight
these fucking guys!

19:26.373 --> 19:28.750
[Ricky] Okay, boys, we're gonna have
to fucking shoot this out.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.961
Guys, no pussying out, all right?
You ready?

19:31.044 --> 19:32.921
-Yeah, dude, I'm ready.
-All right, I'm pulling in.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.840
There's a little street here.
I'm pulling in! Get ready!

19:34.923 --> 19:37.259
Julian, we're not getting
in a fucking gunfight!

19:37.342 --> 19:39.887
Bubs, we're already in a gunfight,
if you haven't fucking noticed.

19:39.970 --> 19:43.098
And when you are in a gun fight,
you need fucking guns! Trust me!

19:43.182 --> 19:44.308
[Bubbles whimpering]

19:44.391 --> 19:46.560
-Alright, alright.
-[Julian] Stay down, Bubs!

19:46.643 --> 19:48.228
-[screaming]
-[gunfire continues]

19:48.312 --> 19:50.355
[Tommy] It didn't have
to be like this, Ricky!

19:50.439 --> 19:53.108
I was gonna buy them off you.
But one way or another,

19:53.192 --> 19:56.278
we ain't leaving here
without those 'shroomies!

19:56.361 --> 19:59.072
[Ricky] It's not mushrooms,
you stupid fuck! It's beer!

19:59.156 --> 20:02.159
[Tommy] Beer? What the fuck
you talking about, beer?

20:02.242 --> 20:04.161
[Ricky] We're taking Bubbles'
beer down to Legion

20:04.244 --> 20:07.831
for the fucking dart championships,
and now we're fucking late!

20:08.332 --> 20:09.791
[Tommy] So you mean...

20:09.875 --> 20:13.212
you don't got 'shroomies
in those Freedom 35 boxes?

20:13.295 --> 20:15.797
[Ricky] Why the fuck would we have
'shrooms in the bottles?

20:15.881 --> 20:19.218
Well... I thought you was
transporting them that way.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.220
Which, when I heard,
I thought it was fucking brilliant,

20:21.303 --> 20:24.556
but now that I say it out loud,
it is pretty fucking stupid. Ah, shit!

20:24.640 --> 20:26.558
[Ricky] I mean, it'd be easy
to get them in,

20:26.642 --> 20:28.560
but how the fuck'd you
get them back out?

20:28.644 --> 20:30.354
I didn't think that far ahead, all right?

20:30.437 --> 20:32.773
[Dennis] You could just break
the bottles to get them out.

20:32.856 --> 20:33.982
[Terry] That would work.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.984
Oh, yeah,
that's a fucking brilliant idea!

20:36.068 --> 20:38.987
What'd you do about all the small, tiny
little pieces of glass in the mushrooms?

20:39.071 --> 20:41.573
Do you know what a fucking nightmare
that would be to deal with?

20:41.657 --> 20:42.991
It wouldn't be all that bad, actually.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.911
Is this conversation really
fucking happening right now?

20:45.994 --> 20:47.746
We need to get
to the fucking Legion!

20:47.829 --> 20:50.415
All right, Tommy, what the fuck
are we gonna do here?

20:50.499 --> 20:52.459
Well, I don't know.
I fucked up!

20:53.126 --> 20:55.629
Look, man, we're going
to drive away, all right?

20:55.712 --> 20:57.547
But if I find out
you have mushrooms, Ricky,

20:57.631 --> 21:00.008
I will come back
and I'll fucking kill you, man!

21:00.092 --> 21:01.468
[Ricky] Fuck off!

21:01.802 --> 21:03.553
The fucking door's locked.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.057
-Christ.
-For fuck's sakes!

21:07.516 --> 21:08.684
That was fucked.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.436
Oh, boys!

21:11.520 --> 21:14.439
It's all shot to shit,
for fuck's sakes!

21:15.774 --> 21:19.194
Ricky, do you want to tell me
what the fuck just happened here?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.613
No fucking idea, man.
That was a fucking weird one.

21:21.905 --> 21:25.367
You have no idea why Tommy Bean
and the flappy bird brothers

21:25.450 --> 21:29.204
just fucking started blasting us,
asking you about mushrooms?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.373
Bubs, Bubs, listen.
Calm down, okay?

21:31.456 --> 21:34.793
We'll deal with this later.
We can still make this delivery. Let's go.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.087
-Come on.
-Take your gun back.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.214
They must have thought
we were someone else, I guess.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.675
Yeah, yeah, thought
you were someone else.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.469
-No fucking idea...
-Bubs, get in the truck!

21:44.553 --> 21:46.638
How was that speed
for you? Was it okay?

21:46.722 --> 21:48.390
-[door slamming]
-[Bubbles] Yes.

21:48.473 --> 21:52.144
-Just fucking tow me!
-[Julian] We're two men down.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.773
This is bullshit!

21:56.857 --> 21:59.234
Bubs, I know it's bullshit.
Just calm the fuck down.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.028
Hey, are you fucking
coming with me or wh...?

22:01.111 --> 22:02.696
Get the fuck in the car!

22:02.779 --> 22:05.741
[Julian] It's not that bad.
[Bubbles] What are you talking about?

22:06.158 --> 22:07.701
Julian, here, at least try to fucking...

22:07.784 --> 22:09.911
-Here he comes. Hey, how's it going?
-Hey.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.164
It may not look the best,
but most of this is mint condition.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.666
That's the brew master right there.
When you taste this beer,

22:14.750 --> 22:17.669
it's gonna feel like a diamond rainbow
spraying right out of your ass.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.672
Pickled Jesus in a long white robe!
What happened here?

22:20.756 --> 22:23.091
I can't take this stuff
all smashed up like that!

22:23.175 --> 22:24.593
Whoa, whoa, whoa, listen...

22:24.676 --> 22:25.886
It's Big Cock, right?

22:25.969 --> 22:27.345
Big Cock?

22:27.429 --> 22:31.058
No. It's Big Hawk, with an H.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.893
What, like the fucking bird? Sorry.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.478
These fucking guys
said it was Big Cock.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.480
Where the fuck did you get
a nickname like that?

22:36.563 --> 22:39.274
I'd understand if it was Big Cock.
I assumed you were packing or whatever.

22:39.357 --> 22:40.692
[chuckling] I gave it to myself.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.486
-You named yourself Big Hawk?
-Mm-hmm.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.072
What, do you got a set of wings
hiding there under your shirt?

22:45.363 --> 22:46.907
[laughter]

22:46.990 --> 22:49.576
No, no, I just wanted something tough,
you know.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.162
Not like the tiger or anything,

22:52.245 --> 22:53.580
but birds are kind of tough,

22:53.663 --> 22:55.540
and Blue Jay and The Eagle
were already taken,

22:55.624 --> 22:57.751
so... Big Hawk.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.878
Right. Well, that's pretty fucked,

22:59.961 --> 23:01.588
but anyway...
The beer's here.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.298
Like I said, most of it's mint condition.

23:03.381 --> 23:05.550
A deal's a deal. Come on,
let's make this happen.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.177
No, no,
I can't do it.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.513
I can't sell beer
that's all smashed up.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.890
It's not smashed up, it's shot up.

23:11.973 --> 23:15.519
What? Who in the name of Christ's kittens
was shooting at you?

23:15.602 --> 23:17.020
Probably one of the other three clients

23:17.104 --> 23:19.147
we had to turn down to
make this deal happen.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.067
I mean, someone's obviously pissed off
you're getting the last of this shit.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.820
But look, look,
we'll clean this all up, okay?

23:25.028 --> 23:27.030
We'll even stock your fridges for free.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.449
Look, that's a...
that's a $200 value

23:29.533 --> 23:31.576
right there, for free.
Throw it in.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.453
[Ricky] Come on, Big Cock.
You can do this.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.955
-We need it.
-You don't understand

23:35.038 --> 23:37.541
the bullshit we just went through
to get this stuff here on time.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.126
But I'm a man of my word.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.837
I said it was gonna be here on time.
Here it is.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.297
-Please.
-Just a few short.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.758
-Come on, Big Hawk.
-All right, fellas.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.010
You get it looking good
and get it in the fridges,

23:49.094 --> 23:50.846
-and we'll call it a deal.
-Yes!

23:50.929 --> 23:52.722
-Right on!
-[Ricky] That's the shit right there.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.851
[Hawk] Now come on inside
and we'll get you all squared up.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.519
Yes! Yes!

23:57.602 --> 23:59.062
All right,
let's load them in, boys.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.857
-All right, come on.
-[glass shattering]

24:01.940 --> 24:03.650
Holy fuck, Bubs.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.279
Listen, man, you got to get it together
and stop fucking up.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.282
[shouting] Me?

24:12.075 --> 24:15.328
Bubs, just pick up the ones that aren't
broken, I'll go deal with Big Hawk.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.666
[Ricky] We just lost a bunch of money
there 'cause of you not being careful.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.794
-[gunfire on video]
-Holy shit!

24:25.589 --> 24:27.841
I think we have sufficient evidence
to go to the cops.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.593
-Wouldn't you say, Jim?
-Not yet.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.428
Mr. Lahey, why are
you talking about...

24:31.511 --> 24:33.096
-Randy. Randy...
-...going to the cops and evidence?

24:33.180 --> 24:34.556
-Randy!
-I don't...

24:34.639 --> 24:36.808
Let the man think, would you?

24:36.892 --> 24:39.853
Listen, if the three shit-kateers

24:39.936 --> 24:41.563
are getting into gunfights

24:41.646 --> 24:44.024
with the likes of Tommy Bean,
Dennis, and Terry,

24:44.107 --> 24:47.736
then there's a lot more here
than meets the eye.

24:47.819 --> 24:50.822
It's just the tip of
the iceberg, Randy.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.242
Tip of the shitberg.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.161
[Randy sighing]

24:59.748 --> 25:02.626
Yeah, jack it, Bubs!
Jack that crow.

25:02.709 --> 25:05.629
-Fucking come on, you.
-I hope he doesn't blow all over you.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.839
-[chuckling]
-Ricky...

25:07.923 --> 25:11.134
[sighing] Come on, Bubs,
don't be pissed, man. I'm sorry.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.054
I'm not pissed, Ricky,
but it's just, like...

25:14.137 --> 25:17.891
what's the fucking point? Seriously?
What is the fucking point?

25:17.974 --> 25:20.310
Well, I guess the fucking point
is that I promised you

25:20.393 --> 25:23.063
I wasn't gonna break the law
and I did, but I thought

25:23.146 --> 25:25.148
that because it was
for fucking groceries and shit,

25:25.232 --> 25:27.150
then that makes it
not that illegal.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.069
Imagine if this
was six months ago.

25:29.152 --> 25:31.112
I definitely would've been selling
like fucking crazy.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.491
So this kind of means I'm getting
a little better, doesn't it?

25:36.117 --> 25:40.163
In a weird, illogical,
fucked-up kind of way, sort of, Ricky.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.374
It's just like...

25:42.457 --> 25:44.542
Ricky, we're so fucking close.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.545
Like, we're so fucking close
to being set up,

25:47.629 --> 25:48.964
I can fucking taste it.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.632
And then you'll never have to sell

25:50.715 --> 25:53.635
any amount of "grocery" mushrooms
ever again.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.387
But if you guys
aren't there with me

25:55.470 --> 25:57.555
when all that good stuff happens,

25:58.014 --> 26:00.350
then it's not even worth it to me.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.685
Yeah, I'm sorry.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.854
And I wanna be right there with you,
just don't give up on me.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.023
Ricky, if I was gonna
give up on you,

26:07.107 --> 26:08.566
I probably would've did it

26:08.650 --> 26:11.486
one of the other thousand times
that you fucked up.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.239
-Thanks, buddy.
-[sighing]

26:14.322 --> 26:16.574
Hey. Get my belly, will you?

26:17.033 --> 26:18.159
Come on, deedle it.

26:18.243 --> 26:21.621
Ricky, belly-gettin's
not something you ask for.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.416
Belly-getting is
something that you earn.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.710
[Julian] Hey, boys!

26:26.793 --> 26:28.837
I just got off the phone with Big Cock.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.339
He said he was really impressed
with the customer service,

26:31.423 --> 26:34.175
and the beer's going great, man.
People are fucking loving it!

26:34.259 --> 26:36.594
-Yeah!
-And he wants more.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.763
-Fucking awesome, boys.
-All right, boys, put it in.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.516
Boys, can we just get this
back on track, please?

26:41.599 --> 26:42.517
Fuck, yeah, we can.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.144
Let's definitely get things
back on track.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.812
-Okay...
-[car horn honking]

26:45.895 --> 26:47.397
-Who the fuck is that?
-[guns cocking]

26:47.480 --> 26:49.065
-[Bubbles] What?
-[clattering]

26:49.149 --> 26:50.692
Ricky... Julian!

26:50.775 --> 26:52.986
Is this really fucking happening
right now?

26:53.069 --> 26:54.612
It's... it's just Candy.

26:56.197 --> 26:57.866
[Ricky] Fuck, I hope
she's not here to tell him

26:57.949 --> 26:59.701
he's going back to fucking jail.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.411
Ricky, why would you say that?

27:01.494 --> 27:03.997
Why are you gonna get me
all worked up now?

27:04.080 --> 27:06.041
Do you think that's
what she's doing?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.793
-[Julian] It's a pellet gun.
-[chuckling]

27:08.877 --> 27:12.047
[Ricky] Oh, kissy, kissy, kiss-kiss!

27:12.130 --> 27:13.631
[Bubbles] Oh-ho-ho!

27:13.715 --> 27:16.092
[singsong]
Julian and Candy up a tree.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.720
-B-A-N-G-I-N-G!
-[giggling]

27:18.803 --> 27:19.763
That's fucking funny, man.

27:19.846 --> 27:21.973
I don't know what it means,
but that is fucking funny.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.934
-[laughing]
-What? You don't know what it means?

27:25.018 --> 27:27.228
The B-I-N-I-G-N-E thing.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.357
But it's in a tree!
Julian in a fucking tree!

27:30.440 --> 27:32.484
-[laughing]
-No, Ricky...

27:32.567 --> 27:34.778
And he's probably fucking
naked too, isn't he?

27:34.861 --> 27:36.571
-What?
-[laughing harder]

27:36.654 --> 27:37.781
No, Ricky it was...

27:37.864 --> 27:39.991
Like a fucking bear!
[cackling]

27:40.075 --> 27:41.076
[clattering]

27:41.159 --> 27:43.787
Ricky! Ricky, are you all right?

27:43.870 --> 27:45.580
Here, who's got your belly?
Who's got your belly?

27:45.663 --> 27:48.375
Oh, my fuck,
that's fucking funny!

27:48.458 --> 27:51.169
-Are you all right?
-[laughter]

27:51.252 --> 27:53.630
Ricky, that wasn't
even the funny part.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.007
[theme music]

28:37.674 --> 28:40.301
[seagulls squawking]

28:52.439 --> 28:55.191
[fish] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

28:56.735 --> 28:59.487
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

29:02.449 --> 29:03.825
[whispering] Fuck.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.119
-[light clicks off]
-Fuck off.
