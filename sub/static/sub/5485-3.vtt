WEBVTT

00:10.487 --> 00:12.020
Gently.

00:12.105 --> 00:14.906
I can't do this.

00:14.941 --> 00:16.107
Yes, you can.

00:16.193 --> 00:18.409
Feel the layers.

00:23.116 --> 00:27.001
A man's flesh will
give to the blade.

00:34.261 --> 00:35.593
(inhales)

00:35.629 --> 00:38.463
Too much force.

00:38.515 --> 00:40.632
A gentler hand.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:00.654 --> 01:02.403
(knock at door)

01:02.489 --> 01:05.039
Come.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.457
Morning, my lady.

01:06.493 --> 01:07.742
Good morning,
Isabel.

01:12.499 --> 01:14.332
I think I would like something
with a bit more color.

01:17.053 --> 01:19.387
My mourning time is finished.

01:19.472 --> 01:21.973
Then let's find
something cheerful.

01:44.998 --> 01:46.831
(sniffles)

02:07.088 --> 02:09.687
_

02:09.689 --> 02:11.889
You have never asked me
how I gained these skills.

02:13.693 --> 02:15.960
Are you not curious
about my knowledge

02:16.029 --> 02:17.695
in the remedies
of the body?

02:17.731 --> 02:21.232
I know there are many things
about you to be revealed.

02:21.284 --> 02:23.401
Perhaps I fear the truth
each burden will bring.

02:23.453 --> 02:26.237
Yes.

02:26.323 --> 02:28.823
Sometimes, a past life exposed

02:28.908 --> 02:30.825
can change our living
in the present.

02:30.910 --> 02:33.211
And what of my past life?

02:34.965 --> 02:36.914
Do you know about me?

02:36.967 --> 02:39.050
My secrets?

02:48.395 --> 02:50.762
(grunting)

02:50.814 --> 02:52.730
(grunting continues)

03:21.211 --> 03:23.428
When I was an infant,

03:23.463 --> 03:24.879
a young woman--

03:24.964 --> 03:29.300
a nun--
left me with the monks.

03:29.352 --> 03:31.719
Told them I was fatherless.

03:34.974 --> 03:36.891
Was she my mother?

03:36.976 --> 03:38.893
Yes.

03:41.314 --> 03:43.648
Her journey is finished.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.400
She is gone now

03:45.485 --> 03:48.486
and watches over you
with the angels.

03:48.571 --> 03:51.823
I am sorry, Wilkin.

03:58.998 --> 04:01.249
(Annora sighs)

04:04.554 --> 04:08.005
And how is the boy?

04:08.058 --> 04:09.841
- Lost.
- Hmm.

04:09.893 --> 04:11.426
Full of doubt.

04:11.511 --> 04:12.593
Yea.

04:15.482 --> 04:17.654
(inhales)

04:18.660 --> 04:20.325
As were we.

04:22.605 --> 04:23.688
Yes.

04:29.329 --> 04:31.579

Secured to travel?

06:18.864 --> 06:22.406
_

06:23.047 --> 06:24.246
They approach!

06:24.298 --> 06:25.297
A dozen furlongs.

06:26.918 --> 06:28.668
Wipe that color
from your face, Nia.

06:28.753 --> 06:31.170
I was firm.
You only keep watch.

06:31.255 --> 06:33.422
Watch what? The lot of you
failing without my help?

06:33.474 --> 06:34.640
Enough prattle,

06:34.726 --> 06:35.925
little sister.

06:36.010 --> 06:37.093
Hold yourself here.

06:38.229 --> 06:40.479
(gasps)

06:43.434 --> 06:45.685
I hold for no one.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.106
WILKIN:
<i>We should return to the castle</i>

06:50.158 --> 06:53.109
before the good Chamberlain
wonders where we ride.

06:53.161 --> 06:55.578
Yea.

06:55.613 --> 06:57.947
BERBER:
Good morning.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.865
Morning,
Berber, Calo.

06:59.951 --> 07:01.751
Where's Ash?

07:01.786 --> 07:03.419
CALO:
Our question as well.

07:03.454 --> 07:05.371
He went out for the hunt
yesterday; not shown since.

07:05.456 --> 07:07.256
Ah.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.341
Perhaps he traveled too far,
made camp in midshire.

07:09.427 --> 07:10.760
ANNORA:
If he snares rabbits,

07:10.795 --> 07:13.345
his traps will be to the south.

07:13.431 --> 07:15.881
I have traveled these dead oaks
many times.

07:15.967 --> 07:18.017
Then we venture.
Find the furry poc.

07:18.102 --> 07:19.719
Go well-armed.

07:19.804 --> 07:23.189
These sea caves hide
the banished and thieving.

07:23.274 --> 07:24.807
We also hide like the banished,

07:24.859 --> 07:28.194
all in need of a hasty revenge.

07:28.279 --> 07:30.312
Any gains on finding
the guilty?

07:30.364 --> 07:32.648
We've learned there were
four other knights,

07:32.734 --> 07:34.066
along with our new reeve.

07:34.152 --> 07:35.651
He is the key
to finding the guilty.

07:35.737 --> 07:38.404
Leon Tell led
the company of noble savages

07:38.489 --> 07:40.239
that wracked our village.

07:40.324 --> 07:41.991
Yea, and when we
gain his trust,

07:42.043 --> 07:44.744
we will pry from his lips
the names of the murderers.

07:44.829 --> 07:48.247
My patience may run dry
before his trust sets in.

07:48.332 --> 07:50.332
You gave me
your oath.

07:50.418 --> 07:52.468
Leon torments me.

07:52.503 --> 07:54.754
Petra's cross hung
about his noble neck.

07:54.839 --> 07:57.306
Every glint of that sapphire

07:57.341 --> 07:59.809
mocks my hesitation to plunge
a blade into his heart.

07:59.844 --> 08:01.310
As I want to plunge a blade
into the man

08:01.345 --> 08:02.678
who slaughtered my wife and son.

08:02.764 --> 08:04.563
And for my grandfather.

08:04.649 --> 08:06.899
And my mother, too,
deserves to be avenged.

08:06.984 --> 08:09.068
We all need
to close this pain.

08:09.153 --> 08:12.354
We don't have a proof
of a decorated neck, as you do.

08:12.406 --> 08:15.317
The reeve must stay alive
until we all have our truth.

08:15.987 --> 08:17.757
And would you be able
to hold your rage

08:17.758 --> 08:21.209
if you had certainty of the man
who slit your boy's throat?

08:21.244 --> 08:22.698
ANNORA: Stop this!

08:22.750 --> 08:25.084
The anger is for the guilty.

08:25.169 --> 08:26.335
You need
each other.

08:31.793 --> 08:33.958
At least he listens
to the witch.

08:41.385 --> 08:43.152
Hyah. Hyah!

08:46.357 --> 08:48.357
Noble cowards!

08:48.392 --> 08:49.792
You're on
a fool's errand.

08:49.861 --> 08:50.960
- Yah!
- Yah!

08:53.030 --> 08:54.113
Yah!

08:54.198 --> 08:55.481
(urging horses forward)

08:56.484 --> 08:58.450
(horse neighing)

08:58.536 --> 09:01.287
After them!

09:01.372 --> 09:02.738
Run!

09:02.824 --> 09:05.040
Get back here!

09:06.577 --> 09:07.743
KNIGHT:
Go on!

09:10.798 --> 09:12.548
(cracking)
(neighing)

09:20.808 --> 09:22.842
Shit.

09:22.927 --> 09:24.677
(panting)

09:24.762 --> 09:26.979
(chatter outside)

09:28.432 --> 09:31.350
Where have you been, Maddy?

09:31.435 --> 09:33.903
(fire crackling) _

09:33.938 --> 09:36.155
Marshal and I
had court business.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.407
And what task covers
your boots in clay?

09:42.446 --> 09:45.197
It's best I don't bother you
with the points of my trade.

09:45.283 --> 09:47.700
I've known you since
I was nine, husband.

09:47.785 --> 09:49.668
There's nothing you can say

09:49.754 --> 09:51.287
that would be a bother to me.

09:51.339 --> 09:53.172
(exhales)

10:02.016 --> 10:05.267
I've tried to speak
of this before,

10:05.303 --> 10:07.303
but your devotion
to this farce...

10:07.355 --> 10:09.305
What farce, my love?

10:12.860 --> 10:15.194
I understand the danger

10:15.279 --> 10:19.031
that your generous rescue puts
on you and your children.

10:19.116 --> 10:21.233
But when we are alone,

10:21.319 --> 10:23.485
we can be in the truth
of who I am.

10:23.537 --> 10:25.871
You are my husband.

10:25.957 --> 10:28.240
And I love you deeply.

10:28.326 --> 10:30.826
Is that not
the truth?

10:30.912 --> 10:32.527
(knocking at door)

10:32.528 --> 10:33.528
(sighs)

10:35.807 --> 10:37.210
LUCA:
Father?

10:43.924 --> 10:46.375
Yea?

10:46.460 --> 10:48.293
Services are needed, punisher.

11:01.892 --> 11:04.109
(quiet footsteps)

11:16.790 --> 11:18.824
The color of your dress
would suggest

11:18.909 --> 11:22.244
it is time for less...
weighted thought.

11:23.747 --> 11:26.832
No thoughts of weight,
just distance.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.051
I travel to Windsor
in two weeks' time,

11:29.086 --> 11:31.637
summoned by
His Majesty.

11:31.722 --> 11:35.090
I assume to receive guidance
on how we govern.

11:35.176 --> 11:38.010
Or, perhaps,
to offer condolences.

11:38.095 --> 11:41.096
We often find
much of ourselves

11:41.182 --> 11:42.931
in the grief
of others.

11:50.407 --> 11:53.692
God has a plan
for this noble woman.

11:56.830 --> 11:59.665
Stay inside your truth,
Lady Love.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.701
I am afraid that is a very

12:02.786 --> 12:05.537
uncomfortable place,
dear Father.

12:05.623 --> 12:07.456
(door opens)

12:09.510 --> 12:11.543
Pardon, Baroness.

12:11.629 --> 12:13.712
There's been another
act of rebellion.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.547
Byth Encil.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.432
The effigy
of your husband,

12:17.468 --> 12:20.385
attacked
on the north forest trail.

12:20.471 --> 12:22.771
Children
with yellow-painted faces.

12:22.806 --> 12:24.473
LOCKE: We've captured
one of the offenders.

12:24.525 --> 12:25.691
A girl.

12:25.776 --> 12:26.725
Not yet 16.

12:26.810 --> 12:28.227
Could it not just be

12:28.312 --> 12:30.145
the foolishness of youth?

12:30.231 --> 12:31.446
Painting
their faces,

12:31.482 --> 12:34.199
acting like
their misguided heroes?

12:34.285 --> 12:36.034
Foolishness or not,

12:36.120 --> 12:38.820
it will be perceived
as an act of treason.

12:38.872 --> 12:40.956
Penalty of death.

12:40.991 --> 12:45.327
I pray you stay mindful,
my lady.

12:45.379 --> 12:47.579
With our baron's passing,
all eyes are on us,

12:47.665 --> 12:49.167
from London
to Pryceshire.

12:49.168 --> 12:52.336
We must make swift,
sound and strong decisions.

12:52.337 --> 12:53.337
I believe that
all my decisions

12:53.338 --> 12:55.380
are made with
those intentions.

12:55.415 --> 12:57.139
Indeed.

12:58.592 --> 13:00.058
Where is
the girl from?

13:00.144 --> 13:01.476
She is a most
stubborn thing, Baroness.

13:01.512 --> 13:03.061
She gives up nothing.

13:03.147 --> 13:04.313
The punisher's
been summoned.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.565
He will find ways
to break her silence.

13:06.650 --> 13:08.183
I will speak to the girl

13:08.269 --> 13:10.519
before anyone breaks anything.

13:10.571 --> 13:12.404
Baroness.

13:20.331 --> 13:22.164
(door closes)

13:31.775 --> 13:33.759
- (horse snorts)
ANNORA: - Whoa. _

13:33.844 --> 13:35.277
CALO: There's another one
of Ash's traps.

13:35.346 --> 13:37.379
ANNORA: Come on.
(clicks tongue)

13:37.464 --> 13:40.182
These beasts
have all been maimed.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.219
BERBER:
Wolves?

13:44.305 --> 13:46.555
(Annora sighs, clicks tongue)

13:51.195 --> 13:53.562
(insects buzzing)

13:57.451 --> 13:59.901
This wasn't wolves.

13:59.953 --> 14:01.320
(neighs)

14:08.981 --> 14:09.981
_

14:09.982 --> 14:12.867
LEON: The Byth Encil
starts them young.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.619
We need to know who she is

14:15.655 --> 14:17.571
and where the
other rebels are.

14:20.209 --> 14:22.626
Open the cage.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.353
LEON: You'll need more
than a persuasive tongue.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.439
Pull the fingernails.

14:34.524 --> 14:36.407
The pear will be quicker.

14:39.195 --> 14:41.996
(men chuckle)

14:42.081 --> 14:44.415
LUCA:
I'll-- I'll get it, Father.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.757
With haste.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.848
(door creaks closed)

15:07.056 --> 15:08.890
You stick it in her slot.

15:11.561 --> 15:14.645
God in heaven.

15:27.710 --> 15:30.545
Listen to me, child.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.046
You need to tell
them what you know.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.464
This isn't a game.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.632
(spits)

15:36.135 --> 15:39.170
They want me
to torture you,

15:39.255 --> 15:41.088
bring unbearable pain.

15:43.092 --> 15:46.093
I will get your truth.

15:46.179 --> 15:50.014
Don't make me
do it that way.

15:50.066 --> 15:52.016
You don't know truth.

15:52.068 --> 15:55.019
Mine or anyone's.

15:55.104 --> 15:56.938
We've no choice, brother.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.918
LEON: The punisher is
with her, Chamberlain.

16:18.919 --> 16:19.919
The baroness wants
no harm done

16:19.920 --> 16:20.920
until she speaks
with the girl.

16:20.921 --> 16:21.921
(Nia screams)

16:23.216 --> 16:25.049
Oh, well.

16:25.134 --> 16:27.218
I guess we blame the new reeve.

16:27.270 --> 16:29.437
Yeah, and we know how well
that went for the last one.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.475
I have 17.
Is that enough...

16:36.529 --> 16:38.563
Twins.

16:38.615 --> 16:40.531
A condolence gift
from the king,

16:40.567 --> 16:43.784
along with six
horses and a baker.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.371
Twins.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.256
That will be fun.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.260
This one,
however...

16:53.346 --> 16:55.713
not so much.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.214
Baroness.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.183
(door opens)

17:04.891 --> 17:06.223
The Chamberlain
delivered your need

17:06.309 --> 17:08.025
after we had begun,
my lady.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.859
We ceased immediately.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.612
Deepest apologies.

17:23.326 --> 17:25.159
I need a private moment.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.436
Do you know who I am?

17:55.825 --> 17:58.025
Then you hold the advantage.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.944
I do not even know
what to call you.

18:03.199 --> 18:05.950
Giving me your name
will bring no harm to anyone.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.962
I can't tell you anything.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.549
You can torture me if you want.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.305
What I want is the truth.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.190
Why did you attack our wagon?

18:32.361 --> 18:34.210
Was it a childish dare?

18:35.272 --> 18:39.242
Or are these rebel colors
on your face your true purpose?

18:39.276 --> 18:43.113
The Byth Encil will
take back our country.

18:44.481 --> 18:47.350
What is it that
you want for Wales?

18:52.455 --> 18:55.457
I want it to be quiet.

18:58.328 --> 19:00.329
As do I.

19:05.869 --> 19:09.171
I will have someone tend
to that finger.

19:21.617 --> 19:22.851
Did she confide?

19:22.885 --> 19:25.854
No, she's hardened
in her silence.

19:25.888 --> 19:27.856
The we apply harsh measures

19:27.890 --> 19:29.858
until her words spill
more than blood.

19:29.892 --> 19:32.293
Words rarely give
truth, Chamberlain.

19:32.327 --> 19:35.830
One must be aware of all the
other things that speak to us.

19:37.699 --> 19:39.667
Her dress is
salt-washed and waxed.

19:39.701 --> 19:42.503
Her skin red with the burn
of coastal winds.

19:42.537 --> 19:44.139
She's from a fishing village.

19:44.173 --> 19:46.141
If you caught her
on the north trail,

19:46.175 --> 19:49.210
it is most likely
Penfras Mawr.

19:51.647 --> 19:52.846
Very impressive, my lady.

19:52.881 --> 19:55.682
Very simple, good Chamberlain.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.785
Assemble a caravan,

19:57.819 --> 20:00.187
fair number of knights.

20:00.221 --> 20:03.190
I want to go to the village,
find her family.

20:03.224 --> 20:06.126
If they can make recompense,
we can spare the girl.

20:06.161 --> 20:10.130
You should let our soldiers
bring the family here, Baroness.

20:10.165 --> 20:12.666
Your safety is imperative.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.669
The risk is too severe to
leave in God's hands alone.

20:15.703 --> 20:19.239
Then we shall bring the good
priest and Master Gawain.

20:19.241 --> 20:21.208
Clergy and a punisher.

20:21.242 --> 20:23.210
All hands will
be with us.

20:23.278 --> 20:25.244
(chuckles)

20:31.185 --> 20:33.186
(birds chirping,
insets buzzing)

20:58.212 --> 21:00.246
(insects buzzing)

21:07.354 --> 21:09.788
(sizzling)

21:24.270 --> 21:26.271
(snake hisses)

21:30.809 --> 21:32.643
<i>Ecce...</i>

21:32.678 --> 21:35.646
<i>Crúcem Dómini,</i>

21:35.681 --> 21:39.149
<i>fúgite pártes adversae.</i>

21:39.184 --> 21:41.552
(snake hissing)

21:54.524 --> 21:56.425
Mother.

21:56.459 --> 21:59.094
Nobles are here, looking
for the family of a young girl

21:59.128 --> 22:00.930
caught attacking one
of the baron's wagons

22:00.964 --> 22:02.230
with a painted face.

22:02.265 --> 22:04.733
Has to be Nia.

22:04.768 --> 22:07.002
I didn't know they caught her.

22:07.037 --> 22:08.470
Piss-witted fool.

22:08.505 --> 22:10.472
I...

22:10.507 --> 22:13.075
I wanted to prove
myself, Mother.

22:13.109 --> 22:14.876
- Nia wasn't supposed...
- Hold your tongue.

22:19.282 --> 22:21.083
Ride to our friends.

22:21.117 --> 22:22.518
Have them tell the Wolf
we need help.

22:22.552 --> 22:24.386
Yea.

22:24.421 --> 22:26.822
Take the catch
to the village.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.158
I'm sorry, Mother.

22:30.192 --> 22:32.995
That noble waif is
the only thing stopping me

22:33.029 --> 22:34.563
from gutting you
like a cod.

22:55.985 --> 22:59.353
Baroness, what brings you
to our simple village?

22:59.388 --> 23:01.990
I'll not waste
your working daylight

23:02.024 --> 23:03.391
telling you things
you already know.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.826
So what then?

23:04.860 --> 23:06.627
Your brawn are here
to punish us?

23:06.661 --> 23:08.196
No.

23:08.230 --> 23:10.365
To offer fair trade.

23:10.399 --> 23:13.301
We will spare
your daughter's life

23:13.335 --> 23:15.336
if you give us something
in return.

23:15.371 --> 23:19.740
Oh, you can have all I possess--
fish and poverty.

23:22.010 --> 23:24.378
I wish to meet
this rebel leader,

23:24.413 --> 23:26.280
the one you call the Wolf.

23:29.384 --> 23:31.351
LADY LOVE:
Can you arrange that?

23:31.386 --> 23:33.320
CORBETT:
Baroness.

23:33.354 --> 23:37.524
I want to understand
his need for revolution,

23:37.559 --> 23:41.696
what inspires him, perhaps find
a peaceful solution.

23:43.065 --> 23:46.033
I will not waste
your leisure daylight

23:46.068 --> 23:49.036
telling you things
you already know.

23:49.071 --> 23:52.806
I do not know this Wolf.

23:54.676 --> 23:57.678
You're willing to sacrifice
the life of your child?

24:02.016 --> 24:04.418
That's one less mouth to feed.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.322
Are you finished,
my lady?

24:12.394 --> 24:16.329
Your eyes remain hard, but
I know your heart struggles.

24:16.364 --> 24:20.167
And what of your heart,
Lowry Love Aberffraw?

24:20.201 --> 24:21.768
Does it struggle?

24:21.802 --> 24:24.971
The daughter of a
beloved Welsh lord,

24:25.005 --> 24:26.806
lying next to English war dogs.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
LEON:
Insolence.

24:27.875 --> 24:29.876
No.

24:31.879 --> 24:34.281
What I have done...

24:34.315 --> 24:39.084
what I do from here forth is
driven by only one intention--

24:39.119 --> 24:42.955
to stop the bloodshed
and oppression of my people.

24:44.991 --> 24:47.960
I do not understand
your hatred of me.

24:47.994 --> 24:51.397
And clearly you do not
understand my love for you.

25:07.113 --> 25:10.482
My lady,
the boy there,

25:10.517 --> 25:13.318
seems he caught his mother's
wrath as we rode in.

25:13.353 --> 25:15.521
Perhaps he knows
of something.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.889
Don't trouble
the baroness

25:17.924 --> 25:20.959
with the whims
of a child, executioner.

25:20.994 --> 25:23.629
But if the boy holds
some knowledge

25:23.663 --> 25:26.064
of rebel movements,

25:26.099 --> 25:28.900
it would allow his sister
a lesser sentence.

25:28.935 --> 25:30.936
Yes, manor law
would allow that.

25:32.872 --> 25:35.306
Please, see what the boy knows.

25:52.692 --> 25:54.659
What's your name?

25:54.694 --> 25:57.128
Mabon.

25:57.163 --> 25:59.798
That didn't take much.

25:59.832 --> 26:02.100
I ripped out your
sister's fingernail;

26:02.134 --> 26:03.935
she still didn't
give us her name.

26:03.969 --> 26:06.437
Is it only the women in your
family that hang with balls?

26:08.473 --> 26:11.843
Do you know what will happen
to your little sister?

26:11.877 --> 26:14.813
Manor law says she
must be put to death.

26:14.847 --> 26:16.947
Treason.

26:16.982 --> 26:18.649
I told her to stay.

26:18.683 --> 26:19.984
TORAN:
But she got caught

26:20.018 --> 26:21.385
because you didn't protect her.

26:21.419 --> 26:23.921
- She's a child.
WILKIN: - Indeed.

26:23.955 --> 26:26.456
And you can save her.

26:26.491 --> 26:29.126
Be the big brother she needs.

26:32.864 --> 26:35.900
If we give the baroness

26:35.934 --> 26:37.567
some tellings
of the rebels--

26:37.602 --> 26:40.271
any movement or plans--

26:40.305 --> 26:42.973
it will save your sister
from my ax.

26:43.007 --> 26:45.242
I don't know anything.

26:45.276 --> 26:47.410
TORAN:
Then you are a coward

26:47.444 --> 26:50.613
for letting a girl take
the blade for your mistake.

26:52.416 --> 26:55.152
Let her death haunt your soul.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.793
If-- if I tell of something...

27:06.096 --> 27:08.565
will you keep that truth
from my mother?

27:08.599 --> 27:12.135
I'll say it came
from some other village.

27:18.008 --> 27:21.177
Don't make us cut it
from your lips.

27:22.980 --> 27:25.448
At the entrance
of our village...

27:25.483 --> 27:27.283
down trail,

27:27.317 --> 27:30.019
there are three smoke hovels.

27:30.054 --> 27:33.022
The third contains no fish.

27:33.057 --> 27:36.226
The rebels store supplies
and weapons there.

27:36.260 --> 27:38.694
Good lad.

27:38.729 --> 27:42.398
You have our word no one
will know it came from you.

27:50.808 --> 27:53.509
Gruffudd will learn
of our presence here.

27:53.544 --> 27:57.113
Our reeve already
delivers the news.

27:57.147 --> 27:59.115
Get word to the Wolf.

27:59.149 --> 28:01.684
Tell him of our need
to save the girl.

28:01.719 --> 28:04.687
Perhaps he'll have more
compassion than her mother.

28:04.722 --> 28:07.557
I'll secure him
more weapons and goods.

28:07.591 --> 28:09.959
He has my word.

28:15.283 --> 28:17.196
CALO:
I've caught our meal.

28:20.429 --> 28:22.430
Where are your thousand loaves?

28:23.566 --> 28:25.534
I assume
you encountered

28:25.568 --> 28:27.803
a miracle being as you return
with enough fish

28:27.837 --> 28:29.905
for a legion of men.

28:29.939 --> 28:32.374
I have a deep hunger
in the morning.

28:32.408 --> 28:35.577
I will collect deeper wood.

28:41.984 --> 28:44.353
(praying quietly)

28:56.232 --> 28:58.233
(branch snaps)

29:07.142 --> 29:09.610
Calo has returned with our meal.

29:12.047 --> 29:13.714
It will require

29:13.748 --> 29:17.318
a week's worth of wood.

29:19.587 --> 29:23.257
What you have seen...

29:23.292 --> 29:25.226
word of it...

29:25.260 --> 29:28.296
Your devotion is your concern.

29:35.469 --> 29:38.638
Even if that devotion
is seen as heresy?

29:38.672 --> 29:42.075
God answers to many
names, good Moor.

29:42.110 --> 29:44.044
Only the fearful
and the ignorant

29:44.078 --> 29:46.880
attempt to judge which
is right and wrong.

29:46.915 --> 29:50.117
What of your devotion,
Annora?

29:50.151 --> 29:52.319
Your way with nature

29:52.353 --> 29:55.621
leans towards a pagan faith.

29:57.424 --> 30:00.126
"My Lord hath given me

30:00.160 --> 30:02.728
a way that is straight,

30:02.763 --> 30:04.964
a religion of right,

30:04.999 --> 30:07.867
the path that is true in faith."

30:07.902 --> 30:11.804
From the scripture
of the king's god?

30:14.140 --> 30:15.941
No.

30:15.976 --> 30:19.745
Your book-- Quran.

30:19.779 --> 30:23.615
Chapter six, verse 161.

30:33.326 --> 30:35.694
(hoofbeats approaching)

30:44.404 --> 30:46.405
(man whistles)

30:48.441 --> 30:50.508
(horses neighing)

30:50.543 --> 30:52.009
(men yelling)

30:52.044 --> 30:52.877
Rebels!

30:52.911 --> 30:54.979
Protect the baroness!

30:55.013 --> 30:56.147
Get her safe!

30:56.181 --> 30:59.050
(grunting)

31:00.786 --> 31:03.555
My lady.

31:03.589 --> 31:04.856
(grunting)

31:09.094 --> 31:11.095
(yells)

31:17.569 --> 31:19.871
(men yelling)

31:25.978 --> 31:27.444
Take this.

31:31.415 --> 31:33.616
(shouting)

31:46.230 --> 31:48.231
(yelling)

32:02.612 --> 32:04.981
(yells)

32:28.538 --> 32:29.904
(grunts)

32:34.076 --> 32:36.044
Are you harmed?

32:36.078 --> 32:37.813
Um...

32:37.847 --> 32:39.715
my nerves are a shudder,

32:39.749 --> 32:41.750
but, no, I am not harmed.

32:48.324 --> 32:51.025
I thank you,

32:51.059 --> 32:52.760
Master Gawain.

32:55.197 --> 32:56.997
CORBETT:
Baroness!

32:59.368 --> 33:03.070
Thanks for that swift blade,
Marshal.

33:07.242 --> 33:08.843
CORBETT:
My lady.

33:10.878 --> 33:12.446
Thank God you are safe,
Baroness.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.714
And you and my knights?

33:13.748 --> 33:16.149
Several injured,
no fatal wounds.

33:16.184 --> 33:17.951
LADY LOVE:
Good.

33:17.985 --> 33:20.187
Well, I believe that
is a sufficient amount

33:20.221 --> 33:23.957
of excitement for one day.

33:23.991 --> 33:25.959
Night falls quickly.

33:25.993 --> 33:27.194
Indeed, my lady.

33:27.228 --> 33:28.729
Let us travel.

33:28.763 --> 33:31.130
Come on.

33:37.471 --> 33:39.439
My lady.

33:39.473 --> 33:41.874
LADY LOVE:
Thank you.

33:49.785 --> 33:52.854
Are you sure you won't eat
anything heartier, my lady?

33:52.888 --> 33:55.957
This is fine, thank you.

33:55.991 --> 33:57.692
One never knows when
they'll need the strength

33:57.726 --> 33:59.160
to fight off more rebels.

34:01.763 --> 34:03.932
You cannot take those
kinds of risks, my lady.

34:03.966 --> 34:06.066
It's lunacy.

34:06.101 --> 34:08.869
Do you remember that
I had a mother, Isabel?

34:08.904 --> 34:11.606
Of course.
A lovely one.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.741
I'm relieved.

34:13.775 --> 34:15.208
I thought, perhaps,
you woke up this morning

34:15.243 --> 34:17.178
and thought that you were her.

34:17.212 --> 34:19.746
It is my duty to see
to your well-being, Love.

34:19.782 --> 34:21.014
(door closes)

34:21.049 --> 34:22.049
(quiet laugh)

34:22.083 --> 34:24.851
Good morning, my lady.

34:24.886 --> 34:26.853
May I have your ear
for a moment?

34:26.888 --> 34:29.089
You may,
good Chamberlain.

34:29.123 --> 34:31.725
I'll meet you in
the garden, Mother.

34:36.063 --> 34:37.697
We have found the
supplies and weapons

34:37.732 --> 34:39.699
the rebels hid in Penfras Mawr.

34:39.734 --> 34:41.735
Good.

34:41.770 --> 34:43.437
We can spare the girl's life.

34:45.407 --> 34:48.509
An agreement made before
the rebels attacked, my lady.

34:48.543 --> 34:50.744
A new level of impiety,

34:50.779 --> 34:53.214
where your life
was put in peril.

34:53.248 --> 34:57.150
Anything less than her head
sends a message of weakness.

34:57.185 --> 34:59.920
And trust that I, indeed,
feel the weight

34:59.954 --> 35:02.756
of all that I put
at risk, Milus.

35:05.126 --> 35:07.694
I will give it deep thought.

35:14.035 --> 35:16.270
Is something else
weighing on you?

35:16.304 --> 35:18.605
Yes, Baroness.

35:18.639 --> 35:20.373
As to the point of the rebels,

35:20.408 --> 35:23.043
your demands yesterday.

35:23.077 --> 35:26.246
Were you in earnest
about meeting this Wolf?

35:26.281 --> 35:28.248
I'm always earnest, Milus.

35:28.283 --> 35:30.684
Baroness, at this
very moment,

35:30.718 --> 35:34.655
our king is deciding
the fate of Ventrishire.

35:34.689 --> 35:38.558
If he deems your actions
to be guided by...

35:38.593 --> 35:40.260
feminine frivolity

35:40.295 --> 35:41.728
or Welsh leanings...

35:41.763 --> 35:43.730
They are not.

35:43.765 --> 35:45.231
No, of course not.

35:45.266 --> 35:47.834
But I must ask,
as your trusted advisor,

35:47.868 --> 35:49.736
that you allow me
to give counsel

35:49.771 --> 35:51.004
before making decisions

35:51.038 --> 35:53.973
that could lead
to deep regret.

35:54.007 --> 35:56.509
The baron always
gave me his ear.

35:58.845 --> 36:02.415
I so appreciate
that wisdom, Milus,

36:02.449 --> 36:06.352
but as you know,
I am not my husband.

36:08.955 --> 36:11.758
Thank you for your counsel.

36:17.631 --> 36:19.832
(door opens)

36:19.867 --> 36:23.069
(quiet footsteps)

36:23.303 --> 36:26.572
It gives me comfort seeing you
on this pew every morning.

36:26.606 --> 36:29.508
Benefits run both ways.

36:29.542 --> 36:32.878
I know it is beyond Lent,

36:32.912 --> 36:36.048
but I'm always here
if you need examination.

36:36.083 --> 36:38.951
Thank you, but, um,

36:38.986 --> 36:41.420
I'm afraid my sins

36:41.455 --> 36:44.790
are between God
and my conscience, Father.

36:51.197 --> 36:54.199
You know where to find me if
you have a change of heart.

36:56.069 --> 36:59.271
Strong hand for a learned man.

36:59.305 --> 37:03.575
I've never seen a priest
wield a mace like that before.

37:03.609 --> 37:05.410
It wasn't learned
at the seminary.

37:05.445 --> 37:06.878
(door opens)

37:06.912 --> 37:10.215
We all have a past life,
good Maddy.

37:17.423 --> 37:19.190
Good morning, my lady.

37:19.224 --> 37:21.426
Father.

37:26.231 --> 37:28.066
Baroness.

37:28.100 --> 37:29.233
(door closes)

37:29.268 --> 37:31.235
I trust you've rested well

37:31.270 --> 37:33.704
after yesterday's excitement.

37:33.739 --> 37:36.106
I have, thank you.

37:47.719 --> 37:49.921
Your way with a sword
is exceptional.

37:49.955 --> 37:52.490
I would venture to say
you are more skilled

37:52.524 --> 37:54.858
than my most honored knights.

37:54.893 --> 37:57.461
(laughs)

37:57.495 --> 38:01.398
Handling a blade is, uh,
a task of my trade.

38:01.433 --> 38:04.134
Swinging an ax to punish

38:04.168 --> 38:06.470
is brutish.

38:06.504 --> 38:09.606
What I witnessed
was refined swordsmanship.

38:13.377 --> 38:15.378
(quiet laugh)

38:16.881 --> 38:20.016
You are a mystery to me,
Master Gawain.

38:24.688 --> 38:28.057
As I am to myself, my lady.

38:28.091 --> 38:30.092
(quiet laugh)

38:34.498 --> 38:37.233
My decision.

38:37.267 --> 38:39.668
The girl.

38:43.874 --> 38:47.543
A judgment
forced by obligation.

39:05.696 --> 39:08.297
(door opens)

39:08.331 --> 39:10.065
(door closes)

39:16.573 --> 39:18.974
(sighs)

39:43.333 --> 39:47.002
Do you show yourself
to help me...

39:47.036 --> 39:49.071
or to haunt me?

39:49.105 --> 39:51.273
We are given that choice

39:51.307 --> 39:54.576
with every encounter, my love.

39:54.610 --> 39:56.378
You must decide.

39:58.681 --> 40:00.648
I'm so sorry.

40:05.254 --> 40:07.889
I was brought to my end

40:07.923 --> 40:09.457
at the right time

40:09.491 --> 40:11.259
for the right reason.

40:11.293 --> 40:14.195
How do I do this?

40:14.229 --> 40:18.299
When you stop looking
for all that is wrong, Wilkin,

40:18.333 --> 40:21.635
you will see that what is right

40:21.669 --> 40:23.804
was just in your grasp.

40:32.848 --> 40:34.849
(sighs)

40:43.325 --> 40:45.759
(sighs heavily)

41:00.208 --> 41:02.575
(crinkling)

41:10.251 --> 41:12.119
(hissing)

41:15.656 --> 41:18.058
(hissing)

41:25.065 --> 41:26.733
(hissing)

41:31.639 --> 41:34.073
(snarls)

41:34.108 --> 41:35.375
(screams)

41:37.578 --> 41:39.379
(screams)

41:39.413 --> 41:41.414
(gasping)

41:45.953 --> 41:48.354
(shuddering breath)

41:49.756 --> 41:52.292
Annora?

41:52.326 --> 41:54.727
Healer!

41:55.896 --> 41:57.897
(panting)

42:00.067 --> 42:01.267
What troubles you?

42:01.301 --> 42:03.669
It all troubles me.

42:03.703 --> 42:06.172
I know you see my angels,

42:06.206 --> 42:09.007
but do you see my demons,
as well?

42:09.042 --> 42:13.212
The ones that wrap me in fear
nearly every day now?

42:15.048 --> 42:17.883
We make our own demons.

42:20.653 --> 42:22.387
Then I'm certain
to make another.

42:31.263 --> 42:35.000
She's a 15-year-old girl.

42:35.034 --> 42:37.636
You have learned this.

42:37.670 --> 42:39.537
TORAN:
Wilkin!

42:41.207 --> 42:43.642
ANNORA:
Your brothers,

42:43.676 --> 42:46.310
they need you.

42:53.052 --> 42:55.386
Disturbing news,
brother.

42:55.420 --> 42:57.021
We found Ash's
trap camps

42:57.056 --> 42:59.390
all strewn with
blood and flesh.

42:59.424 --> 43:01.358
- His?
CALO: - We're not certain.

43:01.393 --> 43:03.628
We did find
his herb pouch.

43:03.662 --> 43:05.796
It tells of dread.

43:05.830 --> 43:08.331
God have mercy.

43:13.504 --> 43:15.505
(sheep bleating)

43:19.377 --> 43:20.711
(sheep bleats)

43:20.745 --> 43:22.312
Trapper!

43:23.081 --> 43:24.281
(bleating)

43:24.315 --> 43:25.683
What, ho.

43:25.717 --> 43:28.416
Where on God's earth
have you been?

43:28.459 --> 43:29.826
ASH:
West River.

43:29.860 --> 43:31.060
To find my girl.

43:31.094 --> 43:32.928
Give her a fair weather cut.

43:32.963 --> 43:34.930
A nap that
becomes, yea?

43:34.965 --> 43:38.000
Oh, I was looking for this.

43:38.034 --> 43:39.769
(Miriam bleats)

43:39.803 --> 43:41.203
Yea, I know.

43:41.238 --> 43:42.839
I'd lose my bobbles

43:42.873 --> 43:44.540
if they weren't attached
to my dingle. Heh.

43:44.574 --> 43:46.675
- (bleating)
- Yes, yes, I hear you.

43:53.116 --> 43:55.551
Mix this with water.

43:55.585 --> 43:56.986
Have the girl drink it

43:57.020 --> 44:00.056
an hour before
she meets her fate.

44:00.090 --> 44:01.990
It will ease the pain.

44:03.226 --> 44:05.660
- (Ash talks indistinctly)
- (Miriam bleats)

44:06.896 --> 44:08.997
Good witch.

44:09.032 --> 44:11.166
Mad trapper.

44:29.045 --> 44:30.879
Drink this.

44:32.382 --> 44:35.817
- (door opens)
- Do not fight me.

44:35.851 --> 44:37.386
Drink.

44:37.420 --> 44:39.821
(door closes)

44:49.099 --> 44:51.233
Nearly time to work your blade.

44:52.468 --> 44:54.870
Yea.

44:57.073 --> 44:58.340
Your actions
yesterday

44:58.375 --> 45:01.009
by the coast...

45:01.043 --> 45:03.412
directly offering
our lady an opinion.

45:05.815 --> 45:07.816
Never let that happen again.

45:10.252 --> 45:13.121
You come to me first.

45:13.155 --> 45:15.590
I will decide
if it's worthy of her ear.

45:18.961 --> 45:20.962
I serve the baroness,
not you.

45:20.996 --> 45:25.434
Gawain Maddox
serves the baroness.

45:25.468 --> 45:27.736
Wilkin Brattle belongs to me.

45:27.770 --> 45:30.971
Do not challenge me,
simple man.

45:31.005 --> 45:33.441
I will shred you,

45:33.475 --> 45:35.776
body and mind.

45:35.811 --> 45:37.210
I sense a growing fear

45:37.245 --> 45:39.747
putting on a face of boldness.

45:39.781 --> 45:41.949
Boldness is my most
desirable face.

45:45.587 --> 45:47.187
I have nothing to fear.

45:49.123 --> 45:52.927
Our deep secret
can cut both ways.

45:52.961 --> 45:55.128
Are you not a conspirator

45:55.163 --> 45:58.298
for keeping forbidden truth
from manor law?

45:58.333 --> 46:00.767
Indeed.

46:00.801 --> 46:02.169
We all are.

46:02.203 --> 46:05.839
I could lose my position.

46:05.873 --> 46:07.307
And you...

46:09.610 --> 46:11.744
your soldier,

46:11.779 --> 46:14.814
you new wife
and children,

46:14.849 --> 46:19.319
all of you will
most certainly lose your heads.

46:22.622 --> 46:25.458
They're ready for you, Father.

46:35.002 --> 46:37.370
(boys singing chant)

47:07.499 --> 47:09.534
(singing continues)

47:10.936 --> 47:13.504
(groaning quietly)

47:27.919 --> 47:30.354
(groaning quietly)

(Nia moaning)

48:03.919 --> 48:06.321
(Nia groaning)

48:39.755 --> 48:41.823
Thank you, my love.

48:41.857 --> 48:43.124
Yea.

49:13.455 --> 49:15.855
♪

(moaning)

(knock at door)

50:01.434 --> 50:03.335
- Come, Isabel.
- (door opens)

50:14.113 --> 50:16.380
Is there anything else
you need, Love?

50:16.415 --> 50:18.349
No.

50:18.383 --> 50:19.951
Thank you.

50:25.891 --> 50:27.992
Good night, Baroness.

50:28.027 --> 50:31.462
Good night, devoted maiden.

50:34.032 --> 50:36.033
(footsteps receding)

50:42.307 --> 50:43.907
(door closes)

50:57.722 --> 50:59.923
Oh, you two can hold
your own in the field.

50:59.958 --> 51:02.893
Skills learned only in battle.

51:02.927 --> 51:05.929
Who did you serve under?
Madog?

51:05.964 --> 51:08.198
We hold no ill will
against Welsh soldiers.

51:08.233 --> 51:09.432
(laughter)

51:09.467 --> 51:11.635
Especially ones we have quashed.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.203
(laughter)

51:13.238 --> 51:14.805
WILKIN:
It was another lifetime ago.

51:14.839 --> 51:17.274
We prefer to keep our thoughts
in the day at hand.

51:17.308 --> 51:20.243
TORAN: But we've heard mighty
stories of your skills.

51:20.278 --> 51:23.212
Some talk of a barley village
and bandits.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.047
- Or is that just high rumor?
NORTON: - Nay.

51:25.082 --> 51:26.283
I was there.

51:26.317 --> 51:27.917
We burned the burg.
(laughing)

51:27.951 --> 51:30.387
We, too...

51:30.421 --> 51:31.854
should keep our thoughts
in the day.

51:32.956 --> 51:35.825
Enjoy your drink, gentlemen.

51:45.935 --> 51:47.803
Sir Norton...

51:47.837 --> 51:50.472
the second guilt
confirmed.

51:50.507 --> 51:54.476
Nearly a month
to out that truth.

51:54.511 --> 51:56.578
Will the other three
require the same?

51:56.613 --> 51:58.280
If need be.

52:03.486 --> 52:05.321
I have your oath.

52:07.324 --> 52:08.957
Yea.

52:08.991 --> 52:10.626
The reeve will live.

52:21.871 --> 52:24.414
This devil will die.
