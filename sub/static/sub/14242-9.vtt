- Metanec.

we all protested.

Oh, shit.

- Yeah, sorry.
- Cos of the hours which you imposed.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.519
I know. I forgot.

But look, if you're gonna be here anyway,

07:42.240 --> 07:43.639
why don't you
clean this place up a little bit,

07:43.760 --> 07:44.919
empty out some trash bins or something?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.119

that smoking is still illegal inside.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.199
It can't kill you. Not any more.

07:59.320 --> 08:02.399
But they still haven't changed
the building's insurance.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.399
Insurance companies went bust
along with half the Western world.

08:04.520 --> 08:09.119
Oh, did I tell you? Gas allowances have
been halved. You are way over limit.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.079
Well, what do you expect me to do,
walk to work?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.679
Hey, don't complain to me.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.279
Recession became depression.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.119
- We're all being rationed, even the CIA.
- OK, well,

08:19.240 --> 08:23.039
since you're too busy housekeeping, then
you probably won't be interested in this.

What is it?

08:24.320 --> 08:25.599
A lead.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.239
All right, it's 1 928
and there's a guy hanging

08:30.360 --> 08:33.719
in the cellar of the Giordano butcher shop
and they're selling tickets.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.879
For...$2 you can watch him get killed
and come back to life again.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.559
So who knows if it's a miracle
or he's Harry Houdini?

08:40.680 --> 08:41.879
Either way, it's news,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.399
so plenty of people wrote about it.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.959
Yeah, but that's where
the records disappear.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.799
I've told you,
Ablemarch, Costerdane and Frines.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.959
They went through the archives,
they scrubbed them clean.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.639
Look at this place, Rex. We have tried.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.039
According to the census of 1 930,
the population of Manhattan

08:56.160 --> 08:59.999
was 1 ,867,000.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.319
That's more people than live there now.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.039
Allow for an average
of two children per family,

09:04.160 --> 09:06.399
across three generations, by 201 1 ,

09:06.520 --> 09:08.079
we're looking at a potential
six million descendants.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.519
That's six million suspects.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.079
We have to find and interview
six million people.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.559
So do you see?

09:14.680 --> 09:17.999
That proves my point.
You're looking too close at the facts.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.839
- What else should we be looking at?
- Fiction.

09:20.960 --> 09:25.319
Look, I'll trade you six million people
for one short story.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.999
Because the London office,
they found a story.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.399
It was published in 1 935,
The Devil Within.

09:31.520 --> 09:35.119
Now, it's just pulp fiction, it's all
blood and Satan and that kinda shit,

09:35.240 --> 09:39.359
but it contains five points of reference
identical to the Harkness case,

09:39.480 --> 09:40.599
which is more than a coincidence.

09:40.720 --> 09:45.159
Now...I believe that
the author was in that cellar.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.799
He saw Jack Harkness die,
decided to write about it.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.399
And his name was...

09:49.520 --> 09:51.559
Victor Podesta.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.559
Then we follow the Podesta family.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.559
Oh, sir, sir, this is...
this is where it gets interesting.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.119
You see, the Podestas owned

09:58.240 --> 10:00.439
a grocery store about ten blocks east
of the butcher shop

10:00.560 --> 10:02.639
and they had connections
to organised crime.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.399
Now, the youngest son...john
was stabbed to death back in '27.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.799
Unsolved, mob-related. But check this out,

10:09.920 --> 10:12.199
now we jump to 1 938...

10:12.320 --> 10:15.479
and the whole family just disappears.
I mean all of them -

10:15.600 --> 10:19.159
Mom, Pop, Victor, daughter Emmeline.
Just all gone.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.319
Well, look, maybe the Podestas
changed their name.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.679
Who knows? Maybe Emmeline married
into the three families.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.279
We could look for a marriage licence.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.599
And where would we check that? Hmm?

10:30.720 --> 10:34.399
- The Manhattan Central Repository?
- Damn it, every time.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.199
The most effective thing they did
was burn that place down.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.199
Yeah, and that was 1 965.

10:38.320 --> 10:39.359
I mean, everywhere we turn,

10:39.480 --> 10:41.559
this conspiracy spans
the whole of the 20th century.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.759
People, come on.
This is me you're talking to, remember?

10:45.880 --> 10:48.039
You're forgetting about
the younger brother,

10:48.160 --> 10:52.719
the murder ofJohn Podesta, unsolved.
This is where we got lucky.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.199
The case was bagged,
tagged and locked away,

10:56.320 --> 11:01.079
just sitting on a shelf
collecting dust for almost 90 years.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.079
We still have the murder weapon.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.759
With blood on it? Is that blood?

11:06.880 --> 11:08.799
We have blood.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.919
We have DNA.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.439
- We can trace the family.
- All right, everybody,

11:13.560 --> 11:16.199
let's make a DNA profile
and start looking for matches.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.519

- Yeah?

11:22.920 --> 11:23.879
I've got Jordan and Carlyle.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.839
They were exceptional
with the O'Grady DNA, remember?

11:25.960 --> 11:27.199
And they're fast.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.199
- Want me to use them on this?
- Sure thing.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.439
Do what you've got to do.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.479
Thank you for coming.

distributing for Harry Bosco.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.439
First sign of the meltdown,
China closed its borders.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.479
Not to us.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.799
This says Lucy Statten Meredith.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.399
You'll be travelling under that name.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.999
In fact, that isyour name from now on.

12:37.120 --> 12:42.319
But...the families
want to meet you...in person.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.399
- It's one-way?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.959
I'm ratherjealous.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.199
We won't meet again.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.599
Yes, I'm coming!

13:46.120 --> 13:51.319
If you don't open the door,
we're legally empowered to knock it down.

13:52.680 --> 13:53.599
- Mrs Cooper?
- Mm-hm.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.719
You must be Gwen Cooper.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.359
Ralph Finch. Can we come in?

13:58.480 --> 14:01.119
- Not without a warrant, no.
- Oh! Not necessary, I'm afraid.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.519
I have reason to suspect
you may be illegally harbouring

14:03.640 --> 14:06.319
an unsupported Category 1
deceased person.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.519
And according
to the Emergency Powers Act,

14:08.640 --> 14:10.359
reasonable suspicion is all I need.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.599
You keep an eye on the front.
Gentlemen! We're in.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.879
Oh, I'm gonna complain.
I'm gonna take this to the top.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.719
Just you wait and see,
I used to be with the police.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.679
Yeah, very much in the past tense
as I understand it.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.079
Up you go, boys.
Check the rooms upstairs.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.239
My father is dead. He's gone.

14:27.360 --> 14:31.719
We never said goodbye. No funeral.
No chance to mourn him.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.959
For all I know he was just
thrown into a furnace still alive.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.559
I can't even have a bit of peace
in my own bathroom!

14:38.680 --> 14:39.799
Are you allowed to barge in

14:39.920 --> 14:42.279
- like this anyway?
- Husband, Rhys Williams.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.279
You never shared a surname,
which says a lot.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.639
But we're still missing one person.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.879
So, where's Mary, Gwen?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.559
- What's keeping your mother so busy?
- (GROANS)

14:51.560 --> 14:53.399
Shopping.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.199
(FLICKING SWITCH)

15:06.320 --> 15:07.879
- No lights?
- Uh, no.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.999
Whole house needs rewiring.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.359
No worries. We've got torches. Boys!

15:12.480 --> 15:13.919
Torches down here!

15:15.520 --> 15:17.519
Lend us that, Joe.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.719
All that's down there's rats,
so you make yourself at home.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.479
(WHEEZING)

15:49.840 --> 15:51.999
(WHISPERS) Shut up.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.119
(VERMIN SQUEAK)

16:33.840 --> 16:36.279
It's mice, not rats.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.719
I'd recommend putting down traps.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.479
We'll get rid of the vermin...
as fast as we can.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.239
Out.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.239
Your father is still unregistered.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.919
And I can't leave you alone
until I know what happened to him.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.599
So...you take care now.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.759
Seriously...your whole family,

17:00.880 --> 17:05.479
you'd better take a great deal of care.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.759
God, that was close.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.639
Never mind.
I told you this thing would work.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.999
I had to... I had to pin him down.
(WEEPS)

17:33.120 --> 17:34.359
It took all my strength.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.559
It's OK, Mam.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.679
It's OK. They've gone. OK?

17:41.040 --> 17:42.119
They've gone.

17:52.320 --> 17:56.519
Bad news. DNA trace,
it came out negative. No leads, nothing.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.239
There's no bloodline from John Podesta
on file. I tried everything.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.439
- Shit.
- Son of a bitch.

18:02.560 --> 18:05.719
Sorry. I'll keep looking, but...

18:10.720 --> 18:11.799
Hey, Charlotte...

18:13.280 --> 18:15.999
...the, um, Podesta short story,
we have that on digital format,

18:16.120 --> 18:17.559
- right?
- Yeah, I think so. Why?

18:17.680 --> 18:18.639
Great, can you send it to me?

18:18.760 --> 18:22.359
It's not worth reading.
Like you said, pulp fiction.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.959
Yeah, I know, just send it to me.

18:24.080 --> 18:28.439
- You have an idea?
- No, no, no. Just send it, OK?

18:29.480 --> 18:30.879
Sure.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.559
It's the shopping.
Take it through to the kitchen, will you?

19:18.680 --> 19:20.239
- Eh?
- All right, mate?

19:20.360 --> 19:21.679
Oh, you're early.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.359
Just put it by the fridge,
I'll sort it out in a minute.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.719
It is posh getting deliveries, mind.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.559
Oh, it's my mother's latest scheme.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.799
She's starting to cook for the club,

19:28.920 --> 19:30.559
raising money
charging two quid a cake.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.999
Oh, isn't she pretty?

19:34.120 --> 19:38.399
Are you eating that food, honey,
or are you wearing it?

19:38.520 --> 19:40.279
Mm, sweet.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.199
So sweet...your child.

19:43.320 --> 19:47.159
I realise this might be
something of a surprise...

19:47.280 --> 19:48.799
- but...
- What's going on?

19:48.920 --> 19:52.559
I've been told that you have
certain information that I need.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.999
(CLEARS THROAT) I apologise for
the subterfuge, but I do happen to have

19:56.120 --> 19:58.039
the most recognisable face on the planet.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.559
Not any more!

20:03.240 --> 20:04.439
- What the hell are you doing?
- Look at him,

20:04.560 --> 20:05.519
for God's sake! Look at him!

20:05.640 --> 20:07.719
Look at him!
It's Oswald Danes in our house.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.039
Oh, my God!

20:09.160 --> 20:10.919
You touch my daughter again
and I will kill you.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.119
Take her out of here, Mam, now. Good.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.199
Thank you. Cos I don't want her
to see her mother...

20:16.320 --> 20:18.439
Stop it! Stop, stop, stop.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.799
Stop it there. Hush now. Come on.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.199
We don't want you arrested for murder.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.479
Thank you, sir.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.439
They can arrest me for that.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.479
Now you tell me.
Tell me quickly, you bastard.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.279
You murdering bastard!

20:32.360 --> 20:33.639
Eh? Come on, tell me,

20:33.760 --> 20:36.759
before I get the boys round. Before
I shout your name out loud in the street

20:36.880 --> 20:40.679
and fetch the bloody mob, tell me,
what do you want?

20:47.080 --> 20:48.079
Jack Harkness.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.559
The men who smuggled me
into this country,

20:53.680 --> 20:56.879
they brought Harkness in seven weeks ago
and they brought him to you.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.079
And then you, in turn, found him a haven.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.119
Now I paid good money
for your name, Gwen Cooper,

21:05.240 --> 21:07.239
so I really need to see Jack.

21:07.360 --> 21:13.119
And you will do...exactly what I ask.

21:14.760 --> 21:15.759
Why should I?

21:17.560 --> 21:18.719
Because I have a name.

21:18.840 --> 21:23.639
(LAUGHS) I have the name of a man.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.559
I have the name of the man...

21:28.680 --> 21:30.879
who created the miracle.

21:36.640 --> 21:39.159
Look, someone's leaking information,
you know that's got to be true.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.359
Maybe not from here,
but from somewhere down the chain.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.999
You know, for the past two months,
every move we make, we get blocked.

21:45.120 --> 21:48.919
Yeah, well, I wish it were me.
Then you could shoot me and I could sleep.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.319
- Yeah, I'd like that very much, sir.
- So what did you find?

21:52.440 --> 21:55.879
Victor Podesta.
I figured anyone who writes pulp fiction

21:56.000 --> 21:58.319
is gonna want to keep on writing
even if it's under a different name.

21:58.440 --> 22:02.199
So...I ran the short story through
the pattern-recognition software,

22:02.320 --> 22:03.879
identifying key points of similarity

22:04.000 --> 22:05.319
- in prose styles.
- Did you find him?

22:05.440 --> 22:09.479
I found 320. See, it's more difficult
with that sort of fiction

22:09.600 --> 22:10.919
because everyone writes the same.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.799
And that's only the ones
in the database. But...

22:12.920 --> 22:16.079
out of that there's around 46
with pronounced similarities

22:16.200 --> 22:17.839
scattered all across the world.
Look at this -

22:17.960 --> 22:19.079
22 in the US,

22:19.200 --> 22:22.999
nine in the UK, one in Sweden.
We've got Argentina, Germany, Japan.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.559
And I've got to check them all out.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.599
Well, I think you'd better get started.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.119
Yes, sir. But listen,

22:28.240 --> 22:29.759
can we keep this between you and me?

22:29.880 --> 22:33.919
I mean, this has to be mine
and mine alone, OK?

22:34.040 --> 22:37.799
The, um, latest from the White House

22:37.920 --> 22:39.999
is that they're gonna stop
all immigration.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.519
China closed its borders,
now we're gonna do the same.

22:43.640 --> 22:48.039
Every passing day, we are taking
one step closer to a dictatorship.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.159
And we don't even know
who the real dictators are.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.479
(PHONE RINGS)

22:55.680 --> 22:56.959
Hello?

22:57.080 --> 22:58.879
GWEN: Can you see my car keys?
I can't find them anywhere.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.719
- Um...how did you get this number?
- Look...

23:06.840 --> 23:07.799
whoever you're working for,

23:07.920 --> 23:10.159
it's Jack Harkness they're after,
so you're wasting your time.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.039
He wouldn't turn up here
in a month of Sundays.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.799
So why not just take the night off?

23:13.920 --> 23:15.239
Do you think we're stupid?

23:15.360 --> 23:16.479
JACK: Yeah.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.719
Now drink this.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.639
It won't harm you.
You've had it before.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.519
- It's true. I made you drink it.
- I need you

23:25.640 --> 23:26.999
to have no memory of seeing me,

23:27.120 --> 23:30.399
so I can leave you
with nowhere to put your hat...

23:30.520 --> 23:32.039
or you can drink it.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.399
Option two's better.

23:52.520 --> 23:55.399
GWEN: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.319
- Oh, my God.
- I know. Oh!

23:57.440 --> 23:58.359
- Sorry.
- Oh, I know.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.159
- Hey, I thought you were better.
- I'm fine. I am, don't worry.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.239
Thank you for looking after him.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.199
- Thank you.
- It's so good to see you.

24:04.320 --> 24:09.839
Oh, God, I missed you.
I have so missed you. He's through there.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.039
Jack...

24:20.160 --> 24:22.879
I was told the correct
form of address is Captain.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.319
You once asked me for help.

24:27.560 --> 24:31.599
So you can remember that, the rest
of you - the Captain invited me in.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.959
I want to ask one thing first -

24:41.080 --> 24:44.319
at your trial, you said about that girl,

24:44.440 --> 24:47.039
"She should have run faster."
Did you really say that?

24:47.160 --> 24:48.639
Yes, I did.

24:50.520 --> 24:51.719
Right. OK.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.719
Cos let me tell you, Oswald,
I used to be a policewoman

24:55.840 --> 24:57.759
and I worked
with paedophiles and murderers,

24:57.880 --> 24:59.759
and God help me, I saw men so alone

24:59.880 --> 25:04.039
and...and damned and...wretched.
But that's not you.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.759
That's... That's nothing like you.

25:08.120 --> 25:11.039
Because for the first time in my life

25:11.160 --> 25:13.599
I've met a monster. Is that clear?

25:15.160 --> 25:18.119
I feel very special. And well said.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.799
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Leave it.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.319
OK, everyone,
all we need is information.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.159
Tell us what you know.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.559
And what happens to me after that?

25:27.680 --> 25:30.559
Oh, then we kill you. And don't forget,
there's no murder any more.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.639
So I can make you
Category 1 for ever, pal.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.039
I haven't agreed to anything.

25:34.160 --> 25:37.479
So you just tell me what you know
or we are calling the police now.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.839
You're keeping
a few secrets yourself, Gwen.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.079
You had me tied up here all day,
and all those whispers,

25:45.200 --> 25:48.279
all those looks towards...that cellar.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.399
Are you hiding something down there
by any chance?

25:52.920 --> 25:55.559
Excuse me, you were gonna call the police.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.759
OK, there may be deals to be made...

25:58.880 --> 26:00.199
There may not.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.319
But before we can decide anything,

26:03.440 --> 26:06.959
there needs to be a full and fair
exchange of information.

26:07.080 --> 26:10.719
Mr Danes, there's no going back.
You need to tell us what you know.

26:13.160 --> 26:16.359
I'll say this -
PhiCorp gave me an assistant,

26:16.480 --> 26:21.159
a woman called Jillian Kitzinger,
and in my crate over there

26:21.280 --> 26:23.479
I have Miss Kitzinger's laptop.

26:23.600 --> 26:27.239
God's sake, is that it? (LAUGHS)
We raided her file way back.

26:27.360 --> 26:28.439
Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.559
As soon as I'd stolen the laptop,

26:30.680 --> 26:34.319
good little Jilly did exactly the right
things - she changed the passwords,

26:34.440 --> 26:36.839
opened new accounts,
deleted the old ones.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.759
But I was watching.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.559
And I know my way around online
better than most.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.199
I know how to keep myself hidden.

26:45.320 --> 26:48.599
So I shadowed her,
and I've been following Miss Kitzinger

26:48.720 --> 26:50.719
these past two months.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.559
Here's a funny thing.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.159
Yesterday at 1 2 midday she disappeared.

26:55.280 --> 27:01.519
Her entire profile online vanished.

27:01.640 --> 27:04.439
Jilly Kitzinger ceased to exist.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.679
- You said you had the name of a man.
- (OSWALD SIGHS)

27:17.800 --> 27:19.679
Soon as I say this,
I'll be at your mercy.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.799
- Yes.
- Tell us his name!

27:21.920 --> 27:24.679
I'll have to trust you, remember that.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.279
I'm trusting you.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.719
One man's name keeps reoccurring.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.719
Kitzinger was employed
to send him information.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.999
And his name's Harry Bosco.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.799
Harry Bosco?

27:38.920 --> 27:42.039
- His name, over and over again.
- Esther?

27:42.160 --> 27:43.519
Harry Bosco.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.439
- Sorry.
- Why can't you search him?

27:50.920 --> 27:52.519
You think you're clever, Oswald?

27:52.640 --> 27:54.959
Is that really all you had?

27:55.080 --> 27:56.199
It's a name.

27:56.320 --> 27:59.159
Harry Bosco isn't a man.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.919
Harry Bosco is a process.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.279
It goes back to Vietnam.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.559
It was the first war to be televised,

28:09.680 --> 28:11.159
and the government
didn't want US networks

28:11.280 --> 28:13.039
taking feed directly from the Vietnamese

28:13.160 --> 28:16.679
cos for the first time,
information was beyond their control.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.999
So they put agents in every newsroom,

28:19.120 --> 28:22.279
every major TV network,
filtering the output for the public.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.319
Cleverest of them all
was a man called...

28:24.440 --> 28:26.439
Harry Bosco.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.719
- What did he do?
- He'd alter information.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.119
It was subtle.
He did it by mistranslation.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.839
He couldn't censor or change,

28:34.960 --> 28:36.999
but he could manipulate
the English translation.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.959
Change one word,
change the entire meaning.

28:39.080 --> 28:43.039
If you say "victims" instead of
"bodies", you influence public opinion.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.719
All the channels Harry Bosco these days.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.919
So that's it? Dead end?

28:48.040 --> 28:50.519
Done? You finished with him?
Can I have him now?

28:50.640 --> 28:52.759
Could you keep your dog on its leash?

28:52.880 --> 28:55.999
- Watch it, pal.
- My point still stands.

28:56.120 --> 29:00.839
The name's still important
because Kitzinger works in PR.

29:00.960 --> 29:04.959
Why would she be handling
this Harry Bosco process?

29:07.520 --> 29:09.159
To be fair, it's a good question.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.759
Why would the families hire Jilly
to do all this in the first place?

29:12.880 --> 29:15.759
- What's she translating?
- What's she mistranslating?

29:15.880 --> 29:18.239
Cos the three families changed their name,
now Jilly's changing words?

29:19.480 --> 29:21.199
Maybe they're connected.

29:23.640 --> 29:26.799
Chicken and chips.
Didn't have any fish. Too expensive.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.319
- World gone mad.
- And I've got the beers.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.719
- Can I have mine?
- Oh, sure.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.799
(RHYS LAUGHS) Hey!

29:37.920 --> 29:39.239
They've been going great guns, this lot.
You know,

29:39.360 --> 29:42.359
going through someone's e-mails, yeah,
is like reading their diaries.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.959
- So what did we find?
- (ESTHER SIGHS)

29:44.080 --> 29:44.999
Another problem -

29:45.120 --> 29:48.439
Jilly processed this clip
from a local news station in Shanghai.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.159
It's got three layers of language.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.999
It's in the local Wu dialect
dubbed into Mandarin

29:53.120 --> 29:54.119
and then she sent it out
for English subtitles.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.239
How are we supposed to know
what's wrong or right?

29:56.360 --> 29:59.319
- What? Nobody speaks Chinese?
- Shut it!

30:00.440 --> 30:02.919
What do we do? I can't go down
to the takeaway and ask Kenny.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.359
Esther?

30:06.520 --> 30:07.919
Yeah, I know.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.039
(PHONE RINGS)

30:17.560 --> 30:18.519
What?

30:18.640 --> 30:20.559
Rex. It's me. It's Esther.

30:20.680 --> 30:21.799
Don't tell anyone,

30:21.920 --> 30:26.279
but...I need your help. I'm sorry,
there's no-one else I can turn to.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.279
- I've got a lead.
- All right, people, come on,

30:29.400 --> 30:31.719
I need this room. Top priority.
Come on, clear the room.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.119
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.679
Where are you?

30:45.800 --> 30:48.119
Can't say, so don't make me.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.759
We're safe. We're fine. We're OK.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.639
Well, if that's the plural,
I take it that World War II didn't die.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.719
It's going to take more than that!

30:54.840 --> 30:57.599
I've been trying
to kill the silly sod for years.

30:57.720 --> 31:00.319
OK, so that's Gwen,
which means you're in Wales.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.439
So much for undercover work.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.839
You know, you're idiots.
I didn't even have to trace you.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.439
Except you're not
tracing us anyway, are you?

31:07.560 --> 31:08.959
No, I'm not.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.599
We need help, Rex.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.999
We need the CIA.
We need translations specifically.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.439
Oh, shit. Um...

31:16.560 --> 31:17.959
OK, I'll try.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.159
- Can't tell them why.
- Oh, I know, believe me.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.199
This place isn't safe.
What's the language?

31:22.320 --> 31:25.399
Mandarin.
We think there's something in Shanghai.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.879
Morning.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.879
Guess you're my breakfast meeting.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.039
I'm Jilly Kitzinger.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.879
No, you're Lucy Statten Meredith.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.959
Congratulations, you failed the test.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.279
OK, I keep wondering, why me?

32:04.400 --> 32:05.959
You're a storyteller.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.199
- Thank you.
- Look at you -

32:09.320 --> 32:11.159
the nails, the coat, the lipstick.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.559
From the moment you walk through
the door, you tell a story.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.519
You might have noticed
we're kind of good at keeping quiet.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.119
So we need you.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.559
We need experts.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.639
So what's your story?

32:27.920 --> 32:29.439
I'm the latest chapter in an epic.

32:30.920 --> 32:33.959
Once upon a time,
there were three wise families.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.239
And they went out into the world.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.119
One family took politics,

32:38.240 --> 32:40.999
one family took finance
and one family took media.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.439
But...that's all in the past.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.039
The stories yet to come,
they're the best.

32:47.160 --> 32:50.919
So does that mean there's a story
about to break? With the miracle?

32:51.040 --> 32:52.199
Not for me to say.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.439
You want me to what?
Prepare a statement? Mount a campaign?

32:57.560 --> 33:01.399
That's kind of small, don't you think?

33:03.440 --> 33:04.799
Then what?

33:05.880 --> 33:07.439
We need you to write history.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.319
I could do that.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.759
Good.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.559
Nice recovery.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.119
Your hair is a work of art.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.479
If you ever come here at night,

33:26.600 --> 33:28.999
try the mitten crab.
It's a local delicacy.

33:29.120 --> 33:31.959
So what do you want me to do next?

33:32.080 --> 33:33.759
Stay in your hotel and wait.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.119
When we're ready,
you'll be taken to the Blessing.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.119
I hope you survive.

33:38.240 --> 33:41.399
I'm sorry...what do you mean by that?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.599
Well, some people die.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.639
The Blessing, it kills them.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.799
Good luck. You won't see me again.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.879
(DUBBED MANDARIN ON SOUNDTRACK)

34:06.400 --> 34:07.999
This is pre-miracle.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.319
He died two days later.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.559
But he went crazy, burned down
a hospital, got caught in his own fire.

34:12.680 --> 34:15.079
- This guy should win the Darwin Award.
- "Godsend",

34:15.200 --> 34:17.759
- you got that, Rex?
- Yeah, yeah. I saw it first.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.799
I knew it. The English isn't "godsend".
The actual phrase is

34:20.920 --> 34:22.839
"It's a blessing my life was saved."

34:22.960 --> 34:24.239
ALL: "Blessing."

34:24.360 --> 34:27.599
It doesn't mean anything.
We'd all say that. He survived a fire.

34:27.720 --> 34:30.879
REX: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Would
somebody shut the husband up, please?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.079
That's the Mandarin,

34:32.200 --> 34:33.639
but the original Wu dialect is different.

34:33.760 --> 34:35.119
Are you ready for this?

34:35.240 --> 34:36.959
He didn't say,
"It's a blessing my life was saved."

34:37.080 --> 34:38.799
He said, "The Blessing saved my life."

34:38.920 --> 34:41.719
They mistranslated it on purpose.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.079
"The Blessing saved my life."

34:44.400 --> 34:45.719
It's in Shanghai.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.679
- The Blessing's in Shanghai.
- How the hell do we get to Shanghai?

34:47.800 --> 34:50.559
Oh, for God's sake! You're not serious?

34:50.680 --> 34:52.559
Well...they hid the word "Blessing", Rhys.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.599
It wasn't hidden from the bloody Chinese!

34:54.720 --> 34:56.119
They saw it and there's enough of them!

34:56.240 --> 34:58.599
But it was only transmitted once
and then it was scrubbed off the record.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.479
Yeah, just because he said "Blessing"
doesn't mean it's in Shanghai!

35:01.600 --> 35:03.079
I mean,

35:03.200 --> 35:04.919
I could say "Jesus",
but I'm not in Jerusalem.

35:05.040 --> 35:06.399
Why did they hide that clip? Now, stop it.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.759
Hush, OK? Just for a minute.
The trouble is,

35:08.880 --> 35:11.199
getting into Shanghai is going to be
impossible. They've closed the borders,

35:11.320 --> 35:13.959
withdrawn from the UN. I mean,
the whole of China is a no-go area.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.199
Yeah, and there's no way I can get in

35:15.320 --> 35:17.639
without posting it as a full-scale
mission, and that's going to leak.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.799
By the time we'd get there
they'd be gone.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.439
- You could take a slow boat.
- Shut it!

35:21.560 --> 35:22.959
Wait a minute, who was that?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.199
- Who else is there?
- Just... Just Rhys.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.599
Never mind.

35:27.800 --> 35:31.359
Esther, is there anything
within mainland China?

35:31.480 --> 35:33.199
Any open ports? Anything?

35:33.320 --> 35:36.319
No, but...wait.

35:36.440 --> 35:38.799
I knew a man once, way back,
um, worked out

35:38.920 --> 35:40.919
- of Hunan Province.
- ESTHER: Wait, wait, wait, just listen.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.079
OK, think about it,

35:43.200 --> 35:47.399
who burns down a hospital? I mean,
who does that? Why would he do that?

35:47.520 --> 35:49.919
Turns out we've got
another mistranslation.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.719
The Mandarin says "medical facility",
but I looked up the address.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.999
It was a blood bank.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.839
Blood again.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.919
- It's always about blood. Why is that?
- Wait, wait, wait.

35:59.040 --> 36:02.439
OK. Run a check on that,
but reference it with Kitzinger.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.919
She has a second clip in Spanish. It's...

36:05.040 --> 36:07.199
There's a second blood bank
in Buenos Aires,

36:07.320 --> 36:09.679
a blood bank destroyed by fire

36:09.800 --> 36:11.919
24 hours before Shanghai,
five days before the miracle.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.079
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

36:14.200 --> 36:18.399
I had Argentina. Right there.
John Forester, died age 76 in La Boca.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.879
I think he was in the cellar with Jack.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.839
But that man said,
"Miracle in Shanghai," yes?

36:21.960 --> 36:24.679
Then why'd they burn down
a blood bank in Buenos Aires?

36:24.800 --> 36:26.319
I mean, why burn down
a blood bank at all?

36:26.440 --> 36:29.199
We don't even know what the Blessing is.
Maybe it's some sort of ritual.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.879
Maybe it happens in both cities at once.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.399
Whoa, hang on a minute.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.879
(SHOUTING)

36:37.000 --> 36:38.839
(WHISPERS) Rhys, my dad!

36:51.000 --> 36:52.159
Hello?

36:59.760 --> 37:02.079
- Hello there, Gwen.
- Hello.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.959
Got company?

37:04.080 --> 37:07.799
Yeah, we're just visiting from London.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.079
Don't worry, anyone who can
leave the house under their own steam

37:10.200 --> 37:12.079
is of no interest to me.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.279
What's going on?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.759
Been busy down there, Rhys?

37:18.880 --> 37:20.519
No.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.599
Well, you won't mind
if I take a look, then.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.679
In the old days, to find a dead body
you'd use a sniffer dog.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.839
But they've gone the way
of the miner's budgie.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.319
(CHUCKLES) Brand new app -
thermal imaging.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.599
Brilliant, it is.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.079
- Sorry, hold up there.
- This is my house.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.119
My name is Mary Cooper and I live here.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.599
For God's sake, let me in!

37:56.320 --> 37:59.799
This is good. I'm the most wanted man
on the face of the Earth,

37:59.920 --> 38:01.479
but they want someone else.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.679
Yeah, one more word out of you

38:02.800 --> 38:04.439
- and I'm handing you over.
- But you can't.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.519
Because then they'll wonder who you are.

38:20.320 --> 38:21.399
We've got him!

38:24.280 --> 38:25.599
Over there, boys. Behind the wall.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.679
Pull it down.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.319
He's not dead!

38:49.440 --> 38:51.799
He's not dead.
Feel him, he's still warm.

38:51.920 --> 38:55.959
- He's... He's... He's warm. Feel him.
- Not as warm as he's going to be.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.279
Oh, you bastard!

38:58.400 --> 39:00.359
Please don't, OK? Please don't!

39:00.480 --> 39:02.839
- This man is Category 1 .
- Please, please!

39:02.960 --> 39:04.159
It's my duty to take him
from this place

39:04.280 --> 39:06.839
and deliver him into safe keeping
until such time

39:06.960 --> 39:11.599
as he can be disposed of
according to the laws of the land.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.919
(WHISPERS) Please don't.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.119
I'm sorry for your loss.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.639
Goodbye, my love.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.759
- What do you want to do?
- Go to Shanghai.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.959
I don't care if we have to walk.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.839
I will travel the whole bloody world
to put this right, Jack.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.599
I need your permission
to go off grid, sir.

40:29.720 --> 40:32.359
Failing permission, I'm going anyway.
And I need to go now.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.639
OK. What if you need backup?

40:35.760 --> 40:38.599
Well, then and only then
will I contact you, sir.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.879
Minimum notice.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.479
Because if we've got a mole,
I can't risk anyone finding this out.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.759
But this could be it, sir.
This could be the Blessing.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.359
Good luck.

40:49.760 --> 40:50.839
I think I can get us in.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.679
Back in the old days, Torchwood
tracked down a black-market trade

40:53.800 --> 40:56.879
in alien artefacts coming out of China.
Skullion metal and coins,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.319
things like that.

40:58.440 --> 41:01.359
We closed it down, but the route
stayed open...for arms dealing.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.119
- We're going to trust arms dealers?
- I don't care. I'll do it.

41:04.240 --> 41:07.039
OK, OK, wait.
What about Buenos Aires?

41:07.160 --> 41:10.879
- I don't know. Which city is it?
- RHYS: It's both.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.399
You bunch of...nuts.
You can't see for looking, can you?

41:15.520 --> 41:17.039
Eh? Look.

41:18.120 --> 41:19.479
Right, Shanghai...

41:19.600 --> 41:20.959
(WHISTLES) ...Buenos Aires.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.039
Buenos Aires... (WHISTLES)

41:24.160 --> 41:25.279
...Shanghai.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.199
Opposite sides of the world.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.239
Quite literally,
opposite sides of the Earth, yeah?

41:30.360 --> 41:33.879
Yeah? So whatever's going on,
there's got to be

41:34.000 --> 41:35.679
- something connecting them.
- Oh, my God,

41:35.800 --> 41:37.079
are you kidding me? Is that right?

41:37.200 --> 41:40.479
They're antipodes.
They're the antipodes of each other.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.999
Two massive population centres
balanced on either side of the planet.

41:44.120 --> 41:46.479
As the old saying goes,
"Count your blessings,"

41:46.600 --> 41:48.519
cos it turns out there's two of them.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.759
- But what does it mean?
- Look at the PhiCorp logo.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.799
The letter Phi,
circle with a line through it.

41:52.920 --> 41:55.319
It's been right there in front of us,
staring us in the face all this time.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.559
A line through the world?

41:56.680 --> 41:58.599
The Blessing. The miracle.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.359
- Mm-hm.
- But what is it?

42:00.480 --> 42:01.959
We need to find out.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.039
We can get into Argentina, no problem.

42:04.160 --> 42:06.319
Maybe we need to get into both, Jack.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.759
- Maybe you should go one way...
- And you the other.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.759
Buenos Aires. Shanghai.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.759
So this is what we're doing?
A mission on both sides of the world?

42:15.960 --> 42:18.479
- Biggest mission yet.
- Suppose it is, yeah.

42:18.600 --> 42:19.559
And you're taking me with you.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.079
- GWEN: No way.
- RHYS: No, no, no.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.799
I've got better plans for you, bub.

42:23.920 --> 42:27.399
And that's your problem, isn't it, Gwen?
You can't let me walk free,

42:27.520 --> 42:28.839
not a man with my desires.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.399
And you can't have me arrested.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.959
Not now that I know
all about your little plans.

42:35.040 --> 42:38.879
- They can leave you here with me.
- Well, that's just it, you joyous man,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.079
you've just trapped your wife completely.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.919
Leave me here with him
and I think he would,

42:44.040 --> 42:46.199
I actually think he would.
Your husband would kill me.

42:46.320 --> 42:49.679
He'd make me Category 1
with his own bare hands.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.479
You would kill me, wouldn't you?

42:51.600 --> 42:52.839
Yeah?

42:52.960 --> 42:54.439
Is that what you want?

42:54.560 --> 42:57.519
No. I'm coming with you.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.559
There's no choice.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.839
There's not a choice
in the whole of the world.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.279
(SPEAKS MANDARIN)

43:28.120 --> 43:30.319
(MAN CONTINUES
TO SPEAK MANDARIN)

43:31.520 --> 43:33.159
JACK: Hup! Let's go!

43:59.960 --> 44:02.919
- (SIGHS) It made it.
- Yeah.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.999
The only way to get this stuff through
was in a diplomatic bag.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.839
Oh, man. Don't start
with that hugging shit.

44:08.960 --> 44:10.519
Shut up.

44:10.640 --> 44:14.279
Come on. Look, the only problem is
I had to sign for the case.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.639
Now, I'm running this thing undercover,

44:15.760 --> 44:19.919
but if anyone checks the embassy
notifications...we're screwed.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.479
(BEEPING)

46:11.760 --> 46:13.519
You must feel terrible.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.799
No, I'm fine.

46:16.920 --> 46:19.519
No, I mean, you really must.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.199
That's what the Blessing does to you,
the closer you get.

46:22.320 --> 46:25.679
You're scared. Am I right?

46:25.800 --> 46:27.639
Your skin's a little too tight.

46:27.760 --> 46:32.759
There's something just out of the corner
of your eye you can't quite see. Hmm?

46:33.840 --> 46:34.959
Yes.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.319
You never get used to it.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.159
Come this way, Miss Kitzinger.

46:40.440 --> 46:41.679
It's Miss Meredith.

46:42.960 --> 46:44.159
I don't really care.

46:45.640 --> 46:47.759
The men enjoy those sorts of games.

46:49.440 --> 46:53.319
But the feeling, it started
as soon as we dug deep enough.

46:53.440 --> 46:56.279
I think it's the Blessing's attempt
to communicate.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.279
Then it's a living thing?

47:02.400 --> 47:04.239
Oh, we have no idea.

47:04.360 --> 47:08.599
But certainly the Blessing sends
some sort of impact back at the onlooker.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.919
We have a theory.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.759
We say the Blessing shows you to yourself.

47:37.760 --> 47:40.839
I've seen people look upon the Blessing
and end their lives.

47:41.960 --> 47:45.279
There's a brilliant truth about that,
because each and every time,

47:45.400 --> 47:47.799
that person was hiding something vile.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.439
Isn't that wonderful?

47:49.560 --> 47:53.559
It's exhilarating, the damage it does.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.679
I wonder what you'll see.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.559
What can you see?

48:34.680 --> 48:37.559
What does the Blessing tell you
about yourself?

48:44.320 --> 48:46.159
That I'm right.

48:57.400 --> 48:59.559
How far down does it go?

49:01.080 --> 49:03.599
All the way
to the other side of the world.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.439
Uh!

49:16.000 --> 49:18.159
(PHONE RINGS)

49:18.280 --> 49:21.439
Hey. Guess what.

49:21.560 --> 49:23.479
Same old glamour here.
We're in some kind of warehouse.

49:23.600 --> 49:27.039
Yeah? Well, I'm stuck in a hovel
owned by gunrunners,

49:27.160 --> 49:29.679
with Oswald Danes as a roommate.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.199
Not the best day of my life,
I'll tell you.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.479
Still, it's a good phone line.

49:32.600 --> 49:35.599
Yeah, considering the distance, it is.

49:35.720 --> 49:38.919
Just started looking for that Blessing.
God help us,

49:39.040 --> 49:40.599
we're in two of
the biggest cities on Earth.

49:40.720 --> 49:41.999
Try starting with the family

49:42.120 --> 49:43.719
of that arsonist,
and I'm going to go to local libraries.

49:43.840 --> 49:45.279
You look after that weapon, OK?

49:45.400 --> 49:47.399
Jack's blood has got to be important.

49:47.520 --> 49:50.559
- It's safe. Got it here.
- Find anything, call me.

49:50.680 --> 49:52.159
You too.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.679
Good luck.

49:53.800 --> 49:55.479
Bye.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.919
Oh!

49:59.080 --> 50:00.479
Idiot.

50:00.600 --> 50:03.559
You idiot. You told me that was healed.
You're not better at all, are you?

50:03.680 --> 50:04.959
- Let me see.
- Sorry.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.359
It's OK, I got it. OK, I got you.

50:07.480 --> 50:08.479
- I got you.
- Oh!

50:08.600 --> 50:10.799
JACK: I'm so sorry.

50:10.920 --> 50:13.479
Don't be sorry.
Don't be sorry, I've got you.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.279
OK?

50:15.400 --> 50:16.799
Let me take a look.

50:16.920 --> 50:19.759
Oh, honestly!

50:22.480 --> 50:23.519
Oh, God.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.199
Gwen...

50:25.320 --> 50:27.159
If I had known it was this bad, Jack,

50:27.280 --> 50:28.759
you'd never have come.

50:28.880 --> 50:31.359
It got worse when we arrived.

50:31.480 --> 50:33.719
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50:33.840 --> 50:35.679
OK, I got you.

50:41.960 --> 50:43.919
Fine place to die, in old Shanghai.

50:44.040 --> 50:45.719
You're not dying. Don't say that.

50:46.920 --> 50:48.959
I'm tired, Gwen.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.599
This mortal life...

50:53.720 --> 50:55.279
it hurts so much.

50:56.360 --> 50:57.399
OSWALD: Well, now.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.399
Can't say I've been to China before,

50:59.520 --> 51:01.959
so I'm not well versed
in their customs.

51:02.080 --> 51:06.119
But...I've got to say...

51:10.640 --> 51:13.039
...I never knew about that.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.119
OSWALD: Whoa.

51:30.200 --> 51:32.519
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:38.480 --> 51:41.399
It's your blood.
No wonder it's killing you. I think...

51:42.440 --> 51:44.319
I think it's showing us the way!

51:48.760 --> 51:51.639
It's the Blessing.
It's somewhere over there.

51:51.760 --> 51:56.599
And I think, whatever it is,
it's calling you, Jack.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.359
We've changed the whole of the world

52:05.480 --> 52:07.079
and this is just Phase One.

52:07.200 --> 52:08.599
MAN: These are the days of the miracle.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.839
It's like they broke the world.

52:11.960 --> 52:13.279
Why would you want this?

52:13.400 --> 52:15.799
WOMAN: We tear down in order to rebuild.

52:15.920 --> 52:17.119
Somebody betrayed us.

52:17.240 --> 52:21.719
JACK: The world's been turning
for...over four billion years...

52:21.840 --> 52:23.999
I'll see you.

52:24.120 --> 52:25.359
...so much buried under its skin.

52:25.480 --> 52:28.679
GWEN: What the hell is that thing?

52:28.800 --> 52:30.079
WOMAN: You're about to meet the creator.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.399
OSWALD: Who are you?

52:31.520 --> 52:33.519
I come from the future.

52:35.040 --> 52:37.359
Then you must know.

52:41.080 --> 52:43.039
Do we make it through this day?
