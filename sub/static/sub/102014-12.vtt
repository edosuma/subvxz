WEBVTT

00:00.792 --> 00:04.671
[Jughead] Michael Corleone,
Tony Soprano, Scarface.

00:04.713 --> 00:07.966
Small, ruthless gangsters,
all heroes of their own story.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.884
-And every hero...
-[phone ringing]

00:11.344 --> 00:12.887
...has an origin story,

00:13.722 --> 00:16.850
including Hiram Lodge.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.935
Even though he's been
Riverdale's chief tormentor

00:18.977 --> 00:20.520
for some 10 years now,

00:20.562 --> 00:22.272
shockingly little
is known about him,

00:23.356 --> 00:25.275
how we came to be.

00:25.316 --> 00:29.612
And why he's obsessed
with destroying our poor town.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.990
What is his "rosebud,"
as it were?

00:35.535 --> 00:38.121
And why does he collect lost
soul like Reggie Mantle?

00:49.340 --> 00:52.677
And why are the Reggie Mantles
of the world...

00:52.719 --> 00:56.014
drawn to Hiram Lodges like
moths to flame?

01:05.690 --> 01:07.609
-That was a short day
-I have a quick errand
to run, Dad.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.153
-I'll be back.
-Well, you better be back
by 10.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.489
We've got McPharlin's
coming in. I know.

01:13.656 --> 01:14.783
I said I'll be back.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.578
And you are certain it's him?

01:20.413 --> 01:22.499
There is no room
for error here.

01:24.084 --> 01:24.959
Wow.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.713
Great work.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.383
No, this is personal.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.010
I'll handle it myself.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.387
Tonight.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.400
Reggie, you are not
on my calendar.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.157
That's my father's debt to you,
all of it.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.826
Uh-huh.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.495
Mr. Lodge, I appreciate
you bailing my old man out

02:00.537 --> 02:02.872
when his business
was in trouble.

02:02.914 --> 02:06.042
But this makes
him square, right?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.169
That it does.

02:10.046 --> 02:12.340
The only question I have

02:12.382 --> 02:14.384
is what does this mean
for our arrangement?

02:14.425 --> 02:17.887
Well, the truth is, I'd like
to keep working for you,

02:17.929 --> 02:19.556
But I want real advancement.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.307
You know, I'm good
with numbers.

02:21.349 --> 02:26.396
I have Ideas.
Some big, big ideas

02:29.774 --> 02:31.359
Okay. I tell you what, Reggie.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.904
I will find a privileged place
for you

02:34.946 --> 02:36.656
if you do me one last favor.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.285
I need you to get me a gun.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.954
A ghost gun.
One that can't be traced.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.083
-Is that a problem for you?
-No, sir.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.169
No problem.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.337
I'll bring it to you
after I finished my last shift
at the lot.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.507
I promise you
you will not find a better deal
in all of Riverdale.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.259
Come on, Sam.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.136
You're not gonna cheap out
on your son, are you?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.387
[Mr. McPharlin] Excuse me?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.348
[scoffs] Let's go, Sean.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.101
Let me ask you, Mr. McPharlin.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.730
Do you remember your first car?

03:09.898 --> 03:12.483
Mine was a 1970 Chevelle.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.402
I named her Bella.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.155
And boy, oh, boy,
great memories Bella and I
made together.

03:17.197 --> 03:21.743
Cruising, going on dates,
late nights at the drive in...

03:21.784 --> 03:22.869
[chuckles softly]

03:22.911 --> 03:25.121
Mine was named Red Ruby.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.831
She was an '84 Challenger.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.000
[whistles]

03:29.042 --> 03:34.214
Mr. McPharlin, this is the car
your son will pick up
his prom date in.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.257
The car he'll take with him
to college.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.676
The car he'll get laid in.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.388
We'll take it right.
Right. Dad?

03:47.810 --> 03:49.520
I was gonna close that deal.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.856
You didn't need to step in
there with that crash talk.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.233
Yeah, well, you're
getting rusty, Dad.

03:53.274 --> 03:56.236
-I got a half a mind to--
-To what? Hmm?

03:57.612 --> 03:59.030
Beat me like you used to?

04:00.156 --> 04:02.533
Go ahead and try, old man.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.910
I'm not in high school anymore.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.789
It's the sale that matters.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.165
-[sighs]
-Better set some of that money

04:09.207 --> 04:10.583
aside for this month's
payment to Hiram.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.877
I took care of Hiram.
It's over.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.046
We're paid off.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.673
What?

04:16.714 --> 04:18.424
Reggie, is that true?

04:18.466 --> 04:19.968
You don't have to work
for that gangster anymore.

04:20.009 --> 04:24.013
That "gangster" pulled your ass
out of the fire.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.057
-And I was still gonna work
for him.
-Why?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.768
Reggie, what about our dream
about being partners.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.936
Full partners.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.896
That's your dream, Dad.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.857
From where I'm standing,
my future is with Hiram.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.237
I gotta go.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.451
Hiram. I'm asking you
just leave my son alone.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.870
The debt's paid.
Just let him go.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.332
Reggie is a grown man
who makes his own decisions.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.126
Reggie is a fool.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.545
He's blinded by your money.
Doesn't care how you get it.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.381
Well, maybe, Marty,
you're failing to see
your own son's potential.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.175
If he were my son,
I'd be proud of him.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.764
Hiram, I swear,
if you don't let him go--

05:06.806 --> 05:10.810
Choose your next words wisely.

05:10.852 --> 05:14.314
Or better yet,
get the hell out of my office.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.489
Untraceable like you asked.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.033
Excellent.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.119
Reggie, your father came
to see me.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.331
He, uh, stormed in,
made wild demands.

05:31.372 --> 05:34.834
If you're gonna work for me,
you need to get your house
in order first.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.044
Mr. Lodge, I'm so sorry.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.378
Don't apologize. Just fix it.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.590
Then meet me back here tonight.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.552
You went to see
Hiram Lodge behind my back.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.262
Dad, you don't get
to speak for me.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.221
Not anymore.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.225
I can't even look at you.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.977
-I'm so ashamed.
-Me?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.815
Nothing I ever do
is good enough for you, is it?

05:57.857 --> 05:58.775
[scoffs]

06:00.109 --> 06:02.487
But just because
your life is crap

06:02.528 --> 06:05.198
doesn't give you the right
to take it out on me.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.407
You beat me...

06:08.159 --> 06:10.953
punched down at me
my whole damn life.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.705
But I stayed.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.626
After all you did...

06:17.752 --> 06:18.795
I stayed.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.715
Not anymore.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.598
You know,

06:30.640 --> 06:35.728
Hiram has done
more with his life
than you ever will.

06:35.770 --> 06:40.566
And as far as I know,
he never laid a finger
on his wife...

06:41.359 --> 06:42.360
or daughter.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.368
[Hiram] How'd it go
with your father?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.078
I don't have a father anymore.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.206
That's a rather bold statement.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.291
I mean it.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.128
Of that, I have no doubt.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.007
It actually reminds me
my own relationship
with my father.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.759
He didn't approve
of your business either.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.137
To put it mildly.

07:09.846 --> 07:10.888
Where is he now?

07:15.309 --> 07:16.644
Therein lies a tale.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.571
All done.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.455
I don't believe it.
I must have left my wallet
in my other jacket.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.083
It's okay. Just pay me
double next time.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.377
No, no, no.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.005
Tell you what.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.631
I got something better
than cash.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.262
That, my friend, is palladium.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.182
It's precious metal
worth more than gold.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.643
That tiny piece alone
would fetch you
a hundred dollars

07:57.685 --> 08:00.021
Where'd you get it?

08:00.062 --> 08:01.898
An old buddy of mine told me
that there are whole, unmined
veins of palladium

08:01.939 --> 08:06.027
upstate in a small
Rockland County town
called Riverdale.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.112
Riverdale,
on the Sweetwater River?

08:08.154 --> 08:09.906
Yes, sir.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.575
You head north to Riverdale,
might just change your life.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.289
Huh?

08:28.049 --> 08:30.051
The promise of buried palladium

08:31.260 --> 08:33.596
had captured
my father's imagination.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.849
So we moved.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.519
Me, my father, my mother,
to an apartment in Riverdale.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.396
[Reggie]
And was there Palladium?

08:42.438 --> 08:44.941
[Hiram] There were mines.

08:44.982 --> 08:49.695
My father got a job at one,
but after six months
there was a collapse.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.698
He survived.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.825
But the mines were shut down.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.161
[Reggie] And no Palladium?

08:58.746 --> 09:00.957
Rumors of it. But no.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.629
But my father decided
we would stay in Riverdale,

09:06.671 --> 09:09.131
make our American dreams
come true.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.177
My mom got a job
waiting tables at Pop's.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.221
[indistinct chattering]

09:23.187 --> 09:25.815
[inaudible]

09:25.856 --> 09:28.276
[Hiram] While my father and I
returned to our old line
of work.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.404
[groans]

09:31.445 --> 09:33.155
All done. Five dollars, sir.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.490
You've gotta be joking.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.367
There's still all scuffed up
in front.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.578
-I've done my best, sir.
-Not good enough, pal.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.789
Hey, you need to pay us.

09:41.831 --> 09:46.002
Hey, hey, Jaime.
Just let it go.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.587
It's just one shine,
that's all.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.008
[Hiram] After the mine
collapsed, my father

09:52.049 --> 09:54.719
seemed somehow diminished.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.181
The light in his eyes
had dimmed.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.478
In time, we became fixtures
outside of Pop's.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.481
Our customer base grew.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.442
I was polishing
just as many shoes
as my father.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.032
That's good enough, kid,

10:20.995 --> 10:22.955
I don't know if I can
make change for this, sir.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.957
Consider it a tip
for a job well done.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.959
-Thank you, sir.
-Yeah, no problem.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.421
Listen...

10:30.463 --> 10:31.756
if you're ever looking
for a little extra work,

10:31.797 --> 10:34.008
you come see me
at Cucina Sacasa.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.509
I might have something for you.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.473
Have a good evening, gentlemen.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.478
[car door closes]

10:46.854 --> 10:48.773
Uh, don't be fooled, Jaime.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.985
That man is a gangster.

10:53.027 --> 10:56.447
His money
is blood money, all right?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.824
[bell ringing]

11:01.243 --> 11:03.663
Hey, Hermione.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.748
You can ask me out
every day, Jaime.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.626
But my answer
will always be the same.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.461
-No.
-C'mon. Why not?

11:12.463 --> 11:14.340
My mother sort of forbids it.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.968
She said she doesn't want me

11:18.010 --> 11:21.013
to date the son of a man
who shines shoes for a living.

11:23.057 --> 11:26.102
With all due respect,
your mom cleans toilets,

11:26.143 --> 11:28.437
and changes bed sheets
at the Five Seasons.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.522
What's the difference?

11:30.648 --> 11:32.024
I'm really sorry.

11:32.066 --> 11:36.237
She just wants
what's best for me.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.781
But for what it's worth,
I do think you're cute

11:40.449 --> 11:43.244
[Hiram] Hermione's words
cut me to the bone.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.246
As long as I shined shoes
for a living,

11:45.287 --> 11:46.997
I was a second-class citizen.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.918
But I refused to accept that.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.672
[people laughing]

11:56.090 --> 11:57.216
I'd like to work for you, sir.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.178
[chuckling]

12:01.220 --> 12:03.222
Why is that?

12:03.264 --> 12:06.809
Because you have two things
I don't, money and respect.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.895
Huh.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.022
It's not respect, kid.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.066
It's fear.
There's big difference

12:14.108 --> 12:15.568
Then I want to be feared, too.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.030
-What's your name?
-Jaime Luna, sir.

12:20.072 --> 12:23.409
I'm Vittorio Alto.
My friends call me Vito.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.035
Your pop know
you came to see me?

12:26.537 --> 12:27.496
No, sir.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.332
[train chugging]

12:31.125 --> 12:32.209
You got guts, kid.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.799
[rumbling]

12:41.927 --> 12:43.554
All right.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.347
I got a delivery
for you to make.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.265
Think you can handle it?

12:47.433 --> 12:48.768
Yes, sir.

12:48.809 --> 12:49.977
Absolutely certain.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.112
-What do you want?
-I have a delivery
from Vito Alto.

13:02.865 --> 13:03.824
Good.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.583
Now you don't look
like one of Vito's
typical employees.

13:13.834 --> 13:17.421
-What's your name?
-Jaime Luna.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.467
You people. You work
twice as fast for half the pay.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.849
This is for Vito.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.732
Thanks, kid. Any problems?

13:36.774 --> 13:38.567
The guy I made the delivery
to made some comments

13:38.609 --> 13:41.195
that didn't sit well with me,
about my background.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.780
You know, where I come from.

13:44.740 --> 13:45.699
Join me.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.416
This guy, that's Louis.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.418
Everybody knows
Louie's a clown.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.129
You don't take that personally.

13:59.171 --> 14:03.217
I try not to, but sometimes
it makes me really angry.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.177
Still, you kept your cool.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.013
And on this business
that means everything.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.431
-You understand me?
-Yes, sir.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.268
Cheer up, kid.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.311
This is the easiest money
you ever gonna make.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.232
And there's plenty more...

14:20.609 --> 14:22.278
if you wanna
keep making deliveries.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.321
[chuckles]

14:26.031 --> 14:29.034
-You can count on me, boss.
-Good boy.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.703
[Hiram] Vito was right.

14:30.744 --> 14:33.122
The money I earned
delivering packages in one week

14:33.163 --> 14:37.501
eclipsed what I would have made
shining shoes for two months.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.462
Whoever said money couldn't
buy happiness was a sucker.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.132
-Hey, Pop.
-Hey.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.509
Haven't seen
much of you these days.
Where you been?

14:45.551 --> 14:48.220
I got a job at that fancy
Italian place across town.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.597
I make deliveries.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.432
Very nice shoes
for a delivery boy.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.186
You know, pays well.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.689
And I get good tips.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.279
[Hiram] With money
also came confidence.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.072
[upbeat instrumental
music playing]

15:19.251 --> 15:22.254
And I needed every ounce of it
to win over Hermione Gomez.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.631
[exhales]

15:23.672 --> 15:25.382
So how about
that date, gorgeous?

15:25.424 --> 15:27.760
You know, I'm nothing
if not persistent.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.596
Mm-hmm. Perhaps
to a fault, Jamie.

15:34.808 --> 15:35.809
You know what?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.355
You twisted my arm.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.690
I'll allow you to buy me
dinner at Pop's tonight.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.567
-How does that sound?
-Sounds great.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.986
-Seven?
-Mm-hmm.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.162
Order anything
on the menu.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.956
Hell, order it all if you want.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.041
[chuckles]

15:59.083 --> 16:00.876
I didn't realize
there was so much money
in the shoeshine business.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.628
Well, there isn't.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.464
But that doesn't stop my dad
from working like a dog...

16:05.506 --> 16:08.008
day in and day out
to provide for my mom and me.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.302
I can relate.

16:10.344 --> 16:14.932
My mother sacrificed so much
working at the Five Seasons...

16:14.974 --> 16:17.726
all to make my life
a little easier.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.770
I wish there was a way
to repay her.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.355
Exactly.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.691
It's part of the reason
I got this other job.

16:23.732 --> 16:24.900
Oh, yeah?

16:24.942 --> 16:27.194
Where? Doing what?

16:27.236 --> 16:30.155
Making deliveries
for Vittorio Alto.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.744
You mean Vito. The gangster?

16:35.786 --> 16:37.705
Mr. Alto is a businessman.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.833
And working for him
is gonna be my ticket
out of Riverdale.

16:40.874 --> 16:41.917
What can I get you two?

16:43.752 --> 16:46.171
Ah, hamburger with a side
of onion rings, please.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.424
Same for me, Pop.
And a chocolate shake.

16:48.465 --> 16:49.758
-Two straws.
-[chuckles]

16:52.761 --> 16:55.472
And if you did
make it out of Riverdale,

16:56.557 --> 16:58.976
where would you go?

16:59.018 --> 17:02.062
I'd be living in a penthouse
in New York City,

17:02.896 --> 17:04.940
running my own business.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.734
What, did I say
something funny?

17:06.775 --> 17:11.155
No. In fact, as it so happens,

17:11.196 --> 17:13.115
I want to live
in Manhattan, too.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.284
Are you Jaime Luna?

17:15.325 --> 17:17.369
Yeah, well, what's the problem?

17:17.411 --> 17:20.664
You're under arrest
for the trafficking
of class two narcotic.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.833
You have the right
to remain silent.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.501
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.008
[officer] This is no joke, kid.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.303
We know what sort
of operation's being ran out
of that Italian place.

17:34.344 --> 17:37.139
Look, just give us the name
of your supplier,

17:37.181 --> 17:40.309
you can walk out of here
and get back to your date
at the diner.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.560
How does that sound?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.439
I've got nothing to say to you.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.358
How does that sound?

17:55.574 --> 17:56.742
Mister Alto?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.369
How can we help you?

17:59.411 --> 18:00.913
I'm here about Jaime Luna.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.831
He's in trouble.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.926
Your bail's been posted,
you're free to go.

18:15.677 --> 18:16.595
[exhales]

18:17.763 --> 18:18.806
Did you talk?

18:19.807 --> 18:20.682
Not a word.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.393
Who'd you call?

18:23.435 --> 18:24.311
No one.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.529
Not even your family.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.198
Especially not my family.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.825
They'd be so ashamed of me.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.494
Sit down.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.878
You're a good boy, Jaime.
You protected me,

18:49.920 --> 18:52.005
and in turn, you protected
my business.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.221
I'm proud of you.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.809
Here.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.520
-Thank you, sir.
-You've proven yourself, kid.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.021
I'm gonna give you a bump up.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.481
No more deliveries.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.400
From now on,
you're gonna be collecting.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.026
That makes you
part of the inner circle.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.653
Thank you, Vito. Really.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.572
Can I impart
a little friendly advice, kid?

19:16.613 --> 19:17.990
Always.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.533
You afraid
to call your folks at home?

19:22.077 --> 19:24.079
The way I see that
you're still worrying

19:24.121 --> 19:25.789
about other people's
expectations

19:25.831 --> 19:27.666
when you should be
worrying about yourself.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.003
You've got to be
your own man, Jamie,

19:31.044 --> 19:33.255
especially if you wanna make it
in this business.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.674
-You understand
what I'm saying?
-Yes, sir.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.800
Good.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.886
By the way, you better marry

19:38.927 --> 19:40.721
that pretty little girl
who came by earlier.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.306
Hermione? She came here?

19:42.347 --> 19:43.807
She's got her head
screwed on right, that one.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.934
And she had your back
when you needed.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.060
You don't let her get away.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.108
I think I might have blown
my one shot with her.

19:53.150 --> 19:56.236
[chuckles] I wouldn't be
so sure of that, kid.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.071
Especially since I got you
a little something,

19:58.113 --> 20:00.782
um, a bonus to go
with your new promotion.

20:00.824 --> 20:01.950
[chuckles]

20:03.994 --> 20:07.664
Hey, about tonight?
We could finish our date.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.957
Don't even try, Jaime.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.710
Fine.
Well, if not that, then...

20:11.752 --> 20:13.879
please, let me give you
a ride home.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.429
You know, I'm thinking
about changing my name.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.934
-Oh, really!
-Yeah.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.685
I'm tired of living
in someone else's shadow.

20:29.561 --> 20:30.562
I want to be my own man.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.234
What are you planning
to call yourself?

20:35.275 --> 20:38.820
Well, I was thinking,
Hiram Lott.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.366
As in,
"I'm gonna have a lot" in life.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.076
Hmm.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.535
Hiram sounds nice.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.330
Strong, unique.

20:49.665 --> 20:50.832
But Lott?

20:52.292 --> 20:54.086
I think you can do better.

20:54.127 --> 20:58.674
How about something statelier,
like Lodge?

20:58.715 --> 20:59.675
[chuckles]

20:59.716 --> 21:00.968
Hiram Lodge.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.054
It's not half bad.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.144
[pop music playing]

21:20.362 --> 21:23.115
-Fred Andrews?
-Here.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.450
Jaime Luna?

21:27.828 --> 21:30.205
I actually go
by a different name now.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.582
You can call me Hiram Lodge.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.126
-[mouthing] What?
-[teacher] Uh-huh.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.877
And have you filled out
the necessary paperwork?

21:35.919 --> 21:38.130
It's being processed
at the courthouse
as we speak.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.966
Luna or Lodge,

21:41.008 --> 21:42.759
you'll still be
shining my old man's shoes
for burgers, Jaime.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.219
[Marty snickering]

21:44.261 --> 21:46.138
[guttural song playing]

21:50.142 --> 21:51.977
[grunting]

22:02.321 --> 22:03.780
What's my name, Mantle?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.365
Say it!

22:06.491 --> 22:08.410
I want to hear you say it.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.163
-[panting] Hiram Lodge.
-That's right.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.581
And don't you ever forget it.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.382
[door opens]

22:42.069 --> 22:44.237
I got a call
from your school today.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.864
Apparently,
you beat up two students

22:45.906 --> 22:47.616
because they wouldn't call you
Hiram Lodge?

22:50.911 --> 22:51.953
Calmate, Javier!

22:53.288 --> 22:55.874
Que te pasa?
Are you crazy?

22:55.916 --> 22:57.459
You forsake
our family name,
for what?

22:57.501 --> 22:58.710
For... for vanity?

22:59.669 --> 23:00.921
And you think I'm a fool?

23:01.880 --> 23:03.548
Huh?

23:03.590 --> 23:05.509
I know exactly where you're
getting all this money.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.221
It's from
that damned gangster.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.640
-So what?
-[shouting] So what?

23:11.681 --> 23:13.058
It's dishonest.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.351
More than that,
it's criminal.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.272
That man will ruin you,
Jaime.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.899
It's Hiram.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.151
And I'm doing
what I'm doing
for you and Mom.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.236
To give you
the things you deserve.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.862
Things you can't afford.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.823
[sighs] You sad, stupid boy.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.785
Working for the likes of Vito,
are you...

23:33.286 --> 23:35.247
It's going
to cost you everything.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.834
Everything you love, Jaime.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.752
You brought shame
to this family.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.004
Then it's a good thing
I'm not a Luna anymore, Dad,

23:43.046 --> 23:45.257
because I don't want
to be like you.

23:45.298 --> 23:49.219
Spending my days
shining the shoes of men
who look down on me.

23:49.261 --> 23:53.306
You can lecture me
all you want about shame,

23:53.348 --> 23:55.100
but you can't buy Mom
a dishwasher.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.686
Or new shoes for yourself.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.773
It's embarrassing.

24:01.815 --> 24:05.986
Being your son is embarrassing.

24:25.213 --> 24:28.633
Mr. Vito, with all due respect,

24:28.675 --> 24:30.635
I want you
to leave my son alone.
He's...

24:31.970 --> 24:33.638
He's a good boy,

24:33.680 --> 24:34.931
but impressionable.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.311
[sighs] Tell me, Javier,

24:39.352 --> 24:41.480
do you not want your son
to be successful?

24:41.521 --> 24:45.609
He's got nice things,
pretty girlfriend.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.278
Seems to me
your son's old enough
to make his own decisions.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.823
I think you misunderstand me.

24:54.784 --> 24:58.413
I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.

25:00.874 --> 25:04.002
Whatever arrangement
exists between you and my son,
it's over.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.546
Or what?

25:07.380 --> 25:08.423
What are you gonna do?

25:10.133 --> 25:13.094
I'm gonna call the police.

25:13.136 --> 25:16.681
And tell them
everything about you
and your dirty business.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.604
I see.

25:22.646 --> 25:26.733
Well, in that case,
maybe you can, uh,

25:26.775 --> 25:28.485
let me think it over, compadre.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.030
I'll be in touch.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.332
My... My father
was a smart man.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.336
He believed,

25:47.587 --> 25:49.297
human nature was good.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.841
But...

25:54.344 --> 25:55.679
he was wrong.

[Latin music playing]

25:59.933 --> 26:03.395
-How you doing today, Javier?
-Hey. Morning, Pop.

26:03.436 --> 26:04.896
It's gonna be a good day.

26:04.938 --> 26:05.981
I can feel it.

41:27.109 --> 41:29.361
Yes,
but they've all been
wiped clean.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.657
Good.
Very good.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.367
I've sacrificed so much
to get this far,

41:35.409 --> 41:36.535
I can't stumble now.

41:39.788 --> 41:44.835
And when I've mined
all the palladium
that alluded, my father...

41:50.341 --> 41:52.426
I'll get back
everything else
I've lost, too
