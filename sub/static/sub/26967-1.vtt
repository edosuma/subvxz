01:26.999 --> 01:28.198
I could
push you, if you want.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.800
Jesus Fuck!

01:33.698 --> 01:34.531
You
should be careful.

01:34.533 --> 01:35.600
You could kill yourself.

01:37.299 --> 01:38.133
Can I watch?

01:39.766 --> 01:40.697
You can't stop me.

01:40.699 --> 01:41.967
No I wouldn't try.

01:44.532 --> 01:46.563
Can I ask why you're doing this?

01:46.565 --> 01:48.564
I mean jumping off a bridge?

01:48.566 --> 01:51.696
Look, I
don't mean to be rude,

01:51.698 --> 01:53.166
but could you, you know...

01:54.299 --> 01:55.664
Oh, sure, sure.

01:55.666 --> 01:56.600
Yes, yes.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.499
Are you going to be long?

02:15.532 --> 02:16.163
Duh!

02:16.165 --> 02:17.564
You've ruined the mood.

02:17.566 --> 02:19.164
I'm here to help you.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.898
You can help
me by leaving me alone.

02:21.900 --> 02:22.831
Sure?

02:22.833 --> 02:23.699
I could make this much easier.

02:24.899 --> 02:25.732
No?

02:26.832 --> 02:29.597
Well, it's your death.

02:29.599 --> 02:31.201
Here, I've got a card.

02:32.866 --> 02:33.700
There you are.

02:35.132 --> 02:36.165
If you need any help.

02:36.167 --> 02:40.596
Look, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

02:40.598 --> 02:41.233
but

02:43.699 --> 02:44.599
I'm past help.

02:46.566 --> 02:47.600
Yes, well,

02:49.832 --> 02:50.666
good luck.

03:21.099 --> 03:25.466
(dramatic orchestral
music rising

03:43.065 --> 03:43.900
Hell.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.700
And you
didn't look down?

03:55.732 --> 03:56.866
I had my eyes shut.

03:58.066 --> 04:00.967
In a way
you're very unlucky.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.566
And what prompted this time?

04:06.065 --> 04:07.763
Must be something.

04:07.765 --> 04:08.699
You can tell me.

04:10.232 --> 04:11.963
Our lives are
a futile struggle

04:11.965 --> 04:14.233
to make sense of the senseless.

04:15.133 --> 04:16.100
Oh William.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.596
You can see my predicament.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.897
One of my lifeguards
is suicidal.

04:22.899 --> 04:24.467
That's hardly reassuring.

04:25.665 --> 04:28.199
I'm really trying to
understand William-

04:32.798 --> 04:34.964
you're not the only one
with problems you know.

04:34.966 --> 04:37.630
Yeah, the world is shit.

04:37.632 --> 04:39.229
But if you stare
all day at the shit

04:39.231 --> 04:42.033
then there's no wonder
you can only see shit.

04:43.265 --> 04:44.563
The trick is to find something

04:44.565 --> 04:45.866
that makes it appear bearable.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.196
You've got the
gun in your mouth,

04:48.198 --> 04:50.564
your finger on the
trigger but you think,

04:50.566 --> 04:51.666
"I've never eaten a Twix."

04:55.633 --> 04:56.563
What?

04:56.565 --> 04:57.497
It's about finding something

04:57.499 --> 04:59.466
to distract you from
the terrible reality.

05:00.799 --> 05:02.263
Like this job.

05:02.265 --> 05:03.664
I work in a leisure center.

05:03.666 --> 05:05.664
You're a lifeguard!

05:05.666 --> 05:08.596
What could be more important
than saving people's lives?

05:08.598 --> 05:10.531
But when did I
last save someone?

05:10.533 --> 05:11.163
Last year.

05:11.165 --> 05:12.098
Mrs Richards.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.663
She was in the shallow end.

05:13.665 --> 05:15.131
She was in distress.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.596
She could put her feet down.

05:16.598 --> 05:17.731
But she didn't.

05:17.733 --> 05:20.233
She was panicking
and you saved her.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.900
That's the problem, William.

05:26.232 --> 05:28.133
Besides your
questionable attitude,

05:30.566 --> 05:31.767
you need to be here!

05:34.899 --> 05:36.700
I don't think you're
suited to this profession.

05:38.532 --> 05:39.632
We have to let you go.

05:41.298 --> 05:42.766
Think of this as a good thing.

05:43.832 --> 05:45.766
Now you can concentrate
on your writing.

07:33.698 --> 07:34.830
Thank you for calling

07:34.832 --> 07:37.664
NRG gas and electrical supplies.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.596
If you've been disconnected
due to an unpaid bill,

07:40.598 --> 07:41.563
please press one.

07:42.199 --> 07:43.500
Yes, I was away.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.699
No I was hoping it
would be permanent.

07:48.933 --> 07:50.467
No I wasn't trying...

08:55.031 --> 08:56.564
Mr O'Neil?

09:06.198 --> 09:07.697
Mr O'Neil?

09:07.699 --> 09:09.663
I said 11 o'clock.

09:09.665 --> 09:12.166
It is now seven minutes past.

09:13.998 --> 09:14.831
Yes.

09:14.833 --> 09:15.665
Sorry.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.196
You said we could
discuss some options...

09:20.198 --> 09:22.197
I said we should meet at 11.

09:22.199 --> 09:25.196
I dare say it's
that casual attitude

09:25.198 --> 09:28.065
to arrangements that has led
to your current predicament.

09:31.699 --> 09:32.764
Tea?

09:32.766 --> 09:33.596
Sorry.

09:33.598 --> 09:35.162
Yes, thank you.

09:35.164 --> 09:37.566
Sorry, you're not
what I imagined.

09:40.566 --> 09:41.834
Meet many assassins do you?

09:43.632 --> 09:46.631
It's just I never
pictured a polo neck.

09:46.633 --> 09:47.897
What's wrong with a polo neck?

09:47.899 --> 09:49.196
My wife got it for me.

09:49.198 --> 09:50.631
What should I be wearing?

09:50.633 --> 09:51.664
I don't know.

09:51.666 --> 09:52.297
A cardigan?

09:52.299 --> 09:53.229
No!

09:53.231 --> 09:54.165
Hitmen don't wear cardigans!

09:55.365 --> 09:58.632
Well I'm so sorry I'm not
living up to your expectations.

10:04.798 --> 10:07.532
Are you sure
you're up to this?

10:10.099 --> 10:11.500
Let me tell you something.

10:12.932 --> 10:15.664
I've killed more people
than you've had hot baths.

10:15.666 --> 10:17.297
I'm the angel of death.

10:17.299 --> 10:19.597
I'm Abbadon the destroyer.

10:19.599 --> 10:21.530
I'm a one man euthanasia clinic.

10:21.532 --> 10:25.032
Only with me you don't
have to go to Switzerland.

10:26.565 --> 10:28.730
Ever been to Switzerland?

10:28.732 --> 10:29.664
No.

10:29.666 --> 10:31.596
And now you never will.

10:31.598 --> 10:32.930
If you're serious.

10:32.932 --> 10:33.763
I'm serious.

10:33.765 --> 10:34.996
How serious?

10:34.998 --> 10:37.631
Serious enough to
phone an assassin.

10:37.633 --> 10:38.862
That serious enough?

10:38.864 --> 10:40.663
How do I know you
are really serious

10:40.665 --> 10:43.263
and not just saying
you're really serious?

10:43.265 --> 10:47.098
When we met, on the bridge,
that wasn't my first time.

10:48.199 --> 10:49.597
Go on.

10:49.599 --> 10:51.162
That was the seventh.

10:51.164 --> 10:52.631
Tenth if you count
the cries for help.

10:54.565 --> 10:55.963
I tried hanging,

10:59.899 --> 11:00.897
gassing,

11:08.065 --> 11:09.533
booze and pills,

11:15.732 --> 11:16.732
electrocution.

11:21.065 --> 11:23.297
Oh, and I waked
into a main road.

11:23.299 --> 11:24.830
How did
you survive that?

11:24.832 --> 11:26.531
I was
hit by an ambulance.

11:26.533 --> 11:28.062
You couldn't be
in better hands.

11:28.064 --> 11:28.997
Great.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.162
Oh, Jesus Christ.

11:31.164 --> 11:32.466
You really do need me.

11:33.832 --> 11:35.896
I started to worry
that I might be immortal.

11:35.898 --> 11:38.599
I've never met
anyone I couldn't kill.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.467
Actually I wrote
a book on the topic.

11:43.532 --> 11:44.896
My Many Deaths.

11:44.898 --> 11:46.862
It's unpublished.

11:46.864 --> 11:49.532
Okay, so how do you
want this to happen?

11:50.733 --> 11:53.563
You're not going to
garotte me are you?

11:53.565 --> 11:55.531
I don't want to be garotted.

11:55.533 --> 11:56.830
What makes you think that?

11:56.832 --> 11:59.533
I'm getting a strong
feeling of garotting.

12:00.599 --> 12:01.962
Is it the polo neck?

12:01.964 --> 12:03.098
It's not helping.

12:04.698 --> 12:05.499
No garotting.

12:06.699 --> 12:07.533
You have my word.

12:09.998 --> 12:11.596
So, what are my options?

12:11.598 --> 12:16.096
Here, look, I've
got a brochure.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.597
So, you just hang
around bridges,

12:25.599 --> 12:28.929
trying to find clients?

12:28.931 --> 12:31.096
Bridges, cliffs,
tall buildings.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.896
Usual places.

12:32.898 --> 12:35.664
Killing yourself is a lot
harder than people think.

12:35.666 --> 12:36.632
Tell me about it.

12:38.065 --> 12:39.631
There's not much work
for a conventional hitman

12:39.633 --> 12:40.467
these days.

12:41.764 --> 12:44.233
All the Eastern Europeans
taking our jobs.

12:45.632 --> 12:46.830
But I had to meet
my quota somehow.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.599
So, you came along just at
the right time, as it happens.

12:53.032 --> 12:54.597
What about this one?

12:54.599 --> 12:56.729
Ah, the hero's death.

12:56.731 --> 12:59.630
This would be perfect.

12:59.632 --> 13:04.599
Killed saving the life of
a child, a beautiful nurse

13:05.299 --> 13:07.533
crying over my bloodied body,

13:08.665 --> 13:11.296
a small crowd gathered.

13:11.298 --> 13:12.466
Maybe they're clapping?

13:13.665 --> 13:14.962
Do you know a beautiful nurse?

13:14.964 --> 13:15.897
No.

13:15.899 --> 13:18.230
Do you have access to a child?

13:18.232 --> 13:19.066
No.

13:20.164 --> 13:21.663
Well I'm not
saying I can't do it,

13:21.665 --> 13:24.596
but there's a lot
of admin involved.

13:24.598 --> 13:25.729
And it's not cheap.

13:25.731 --> 13:27.696
What's your budget?

13:27.698 --> 13:29.062
Well, I've got
around two grand.

13:29.064 --> 13:30.296
Two thousand?

13:30.298 --> 13:34.232
I wouldn't reverse over you in
a Ford Fiesta for that money.

13:36.732 --> 13:37.866
Well what can you do?

13:45.632 --> 13:47.132
Quick and painless.

13:49.697 --> 13:50.530
Right.

13:50.532 --> 13:52.163
And even then I'm
doing you a deal.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.533
For two grand, it's
usually quick but painful.

13:56.698 --> 13:58.029
How?

13:58.031 --> 13:59.263
Well, I'd shoot you.

13:59.265 --> 14:00.063
From a distance.

14:00.065 --> 14:00.996
One shot.

14:00.998 --> 14:01.898
You'd never see it coming.

14:08.631 --> 14:09.695
Okay.

14:09.697 --> 14:10.896
Deal.

14:11.732 --> 14:12.796
Excellent.

14:12.798 --> 14:14.663
Here we go.

14:14.665 --> 14:15.696
Standard contract.

14:15.698 --> 14:16.897
Name?

14:16.899 --> 14:17.930
William Morrison.

14:17.932 --> 14:18.863
Address?

14:18.865 --> 14:21.163
Flat three, 27 Drake St.

14:21.165 --> 14:22.500
Reason for wanting death?

14:24.964 --> 14:25.862
Why do you want to die?

14:25.864 --> 14:28.263
Is it terminal illness?

14:28.265 --> 14:30.233
Money problems?

14:32.999 --> 14:35.500
Do you ever wonder
what's the point?

14:37.098 --> 14:38.162
Frequently.

14:38.164 --> 14:39.632
What's the point of me?

14:40.565 --> 14:41.897
Why am I here?

14:41.899 --> 14:43.795
What am I contributing?

14:43.797 --> 14:45.763
I think about that all the time.

14:47.797 --> 14:49.732
Over and over and over.

14:52.131 --> 14:54.562
And I want to
switch my brain off,

14:54.564 --> 14:58.965
but it builds until
it becomes unbearable.

14:59.964 --> 15:02.030
It's like my brain is on fire,

15:02.032 --> 15:03.663
like it's burning
from the inside.

15:03.665 --> 15:05.599
And I want it to
stop, to feel nothing.

15:07.598 --> 15:09.566
I've never talked to
anyone about this.

15:11.231 --> 15:12.962
We're already dying.

15:12.964 --> 15:14.132
Just very slowly.

15:15.564 --> 15:16.829
Life's one long terminal il...

15:16.831 --> 15:19.163
Yeah, yeah, look
it's a very small box.

15:19.165 --> 15:20.098
I'll write cancer.

15:21.565 --> 15:22.166
Okay.

15:23.665 --> 15:25.632
All right, sign here.

15:29.198 --> 15:30.196
Excellent.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.595
Well, congratulations.

15:35.597 --> 15:37.965
You've just signed
your own death warrant.

15:39.932 --> 15:41.630
When will it happen?

15:41.632 --> 15:42.430
Oh, anytime within a week

15:42.432 --> 15:44.729
of the money
clearing our account.

15:44.731 --> 15:46.097
All the money up front?

15:46.099 --> 15:48.562
Well we can't get
it afterwards, can we?

15:48.564 --> 15:50.762
But how do I know
this isn't a scam?

15:50.764 --> 15:52.663
Do you have any references?

15:52.665 --> 15:55.762
I'll give you a list
of graves you can visit.

15:55.764 --> 15:57.663
You pay the money
into an escrow account

15:57.665 --> 16:00.196
run by the British
Guild of Assassins.

16:00.198 --> 16:02.962
The money isn't transferred
to me until after your death.

16:02.964 --> 16:04.997
And if you're not
dead within a week,

16:04.999 --> 16:06.531
you'll get your money back.

16:07.631 --> 16:08.897
The Guild of Assassins?

16:08.899 --> 16:10.563
Never heard of it.

16:10.565 --> 16:12.662
We don't advertise.

16:12.664 --> 16:15.133
And the word of
mouth is limited.

16:16.631 --> 16:18.595
What's it like, a union?

16:18.597 --> 16:20.696
We're not bus drivers.

16:20.698 --> 16:24.563
It's a co-operative bound
by a strict code of conduct.

16:24.565 --> 16:27.062
An assassin is not
just a man with a gun.

16:27.064 --> 16:28.098
We're not murderers.

16:29.065 --> 16:30.065
We're professionals.

16:31.564 --> 16:32.531
And what do I do?

16:33.598 --> 16:35.596
Do what you normally do.

16:35.598 --> 16:37.629
Just don't hide in a
cupboard for the week.

16:37.631 --> 16:39.097
I don't mind, I'll
kill you anyway,

16:39.099 --> 16:41.499
but you'll regret it.

16:42.697 --> 16:43.532
Okay.

16:45.031 --> 16:45.866
Right.

16:48.265 --> 16:50.595
You seem like a decent man.

16:50.597 --> 16:52.096
I'm very happy to kill you.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.631
I'm very happy to die.

17:11.932 --> 17:12.862
Hello?

17:12.864 --> 17:13.632
Yes, it's Leslie.

17:16.165 --> 17:16.996
Hello, Les.

17:16.998 --> 17:18.195
Hi Wendy.

17:18.198 --> 17:19.698
I need to register
this contract.

17:29.565 --> 17:30.200
Look at that!

17:31.565 --> 17:32.632
Well done you!

17:33.664 --> 17:34.497
Just in time.

17:35.598 --> 17:38.062
Those assisted suicides
were a great idea.

17:38.064 --> 17:39.962
He's just needs to
transfer the money.

17:39.964 --> 17:41.063
He seemed keen.

17:41.065 --> 17:42.264
Depressed was he?

17:42.266 --> 17:43.696
He's another writer.

17:43.698 --> 17:45.062
Unpublished.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.896
That's the trouble
with some people.

17:46.898 --> 17:48.063
They think too much.

17:49.565 --> 17:50.729
Is Harvey in?

17:50.731 --> 17:52.929
They're all at the conference.

17:52.931 --> 17:55.030
Didn't you get the newsletter?

17:55.032 --> 17:56.030
No.

17:56.032 --> 17:57.297
It's today and tomorrow.

17:57.299 --> 18:01.197
They're staying at
a hotel in Egham.

18:01.199 --> 18:02.766
Here's the schedule.

18:06.299 --> 18:07.563
Mmmm.

18:07.565 --> 18:08.829
Buffet lunch.

18:08.831 --> 18:11.632
So have you got the
Ruger Precision?

18:13.797 --> 18:14.695
No, Leslie I'm sorry.

18:14.697 --> 18:15.965
It's out at the moment.

18:17.565 --> 18:18.833
We've got plenty of handguns?

18:20.164 --> 18:21.662
Glock 17?

18:21.664 --> 18:23.232
Let me just get that for you.

18:33.198 --> 18:35.030
Ammunition is in the case.

18:35.032 --> 18:36.563
Can you have it
back by Thursday?

18:36.565 --> 18:37.466
Yeah, yeah.

18:39.797 --> 18:41.862
Have you still
got the Browning?

18:41.864 --> 18:45.062
No, no, I brought
that back last week.

18:45.064 --> 18:46.498
It's saying it's still out.

18:48.199 --> 18:49.466
Where is it then?

18:59.266 --> 19:00.530
Les?

19:00.532 --> 19:02.663
Did you get the Worcester sauce?

19:03.697 --> 19:04.762
Oh, Leslie!

19:04.764 --> 19:05.930
Well, I'll go now.

19:05.932 --> 19:08.264
No, no, it's not essential.

19:08.266 --> 19:10.030
Look, I'm sorry.

19:10.032 --> 19:11.566
Just be a bit bland.

19:12.532 --> 19:13.863
Well I will go.

19:13.865 --> 19:14.695
No, you're home now.

19:14.697 --> 19:16.130
Don't worry.

19:16.132 --> 19:17.166
I'll add some Bovril.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.066
Hello boys.

19:27.065 --> 19:27.966
How are you today?

19:29.864 --> 19:30.966
What's wrong with you?

19:31.932 --> 19:32.766
You all right?

19:34.531 --> 19:36.632
I thought we could
have it on trays.

19:42.064 --> 19:43.829
It's
hard to move quickly

19:43.831 --> 19:45.930
when you only eat plants

19:47.632 --> 19:49.532
It's a three-toed sloth

19:50.665 --> 19:52.732
The sloth hangs from
branches, eating plants

19:53.964 --> 19:55.529
Bland?

19:55.531 --> 19:56.498
Delicious.

19:59.931 --> 20:01.163
I don't know how I'm
going to finish this

20:01.165 --> 20:02.566
in time for the
Southern Counties.

20:04.765 --> 20:06.530
What I was thinking?

20:06.532 --> 20:07.599
You'll get it done.

20:09.064 --> 20:11.233
Sloths are not
exactly enthusiastic eaters,

20:12.597 --> 20:17.030
but meals takes up a sizeable
proportion of the day,

20:17.032 --> 20:18.899
it's a constant cycle.

20:20.131 --> 20:20.965
Yep.

20:22.531 --> 20:23.662
Bland.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.898
My life was long enough

20:39.198 --> 20:44.200
and full of distress.

20:44.998 --> 20:48.565
Unlike my death,

20:49.564 --> 20:52.565
which was quick and painless.

21:17.564 --> 21:18.997
The time is 8:19

21:18.999 --> 21:22.599
and now a summary of
this morning's news.

21:24.864 --> 21:27.596
This one goes the
whole way round.

21:27.598 --> 21:29.730
120 nights.

21:29.732 --> 21:31.630
Imagine,

21:31.632 --> 21:33.766
wouldn't that be incredible?

21:35.532 --> 21:38.162
There's places here I've
never even heard of.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.499
Nuku'Alofa.

21:41.664 --> 21:42.565
Nuku'Alofa.

21:43.965 --> 21:45.762
It's in Tonga.

21:45.764 --> 21:48.129
And they've got an offer
on if you book early.

21:48.131 --> 21:49.962
Listen love, about that...

21:49.964 --> 21:53.663
Oh Les, you said this year.

21:53.665 --> 21:55.762
You said that you were
going to retire this year

21:55.764 --> 21:57.062
and we could go
'round the world.

21:57.064 --> 21:58.863
No, I said I'd
think about retiring

21:58.865 --> 22:01.696
and I have thought about
it and I've decided

22:01.698 --> 22:03.599
that I'm not ready.

22:05.064 --> 22:07.195
Don't worry, the world will
still be there next year.

22:07.197 --> 22:09.129
But will we, Leslie?

22:09.131 --> 22:10.595
You should be enjoying life,

22:10.597 --> 22:12.662
not working yourself
into an early grave.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.262
I love my work.

22:14.264 --> 22:15.430
And what about Harvey?

22:15.432 --> 22:18.529
I thought he wanted to give
more work to the youngsters?

22:18.531 --> 22:19.430
He can do what he likes.

22:19.432 --> 22:21.562
I've already fulfilled
his stupid quota.

22:21.564 --> 22:22.696
You have?

22:22.698 --> 22:23.795
Yes.

22:23.797 --> 22:25.465
The money just needs to be
transferred, that's all.

22:27.164 --> 22:29.696
At least you can
be happy for me?

22:29.698 --> 22:30.763
Budgies can fly

22:30.765 --> 22:33.062
at over 90 kilometers per hour,

22:33.064 --> 22:34.730
and cover huge territories,

22:43.032 --> 22:45.262
Leslie O'Neil.

22:45.264 --> 22:46.529
Mr O'Neil?

22:46.531 --> 22:47.563
Yeah.

22:47.565 --> 22:49.161
It's William Morrison.

22:49.163 --> 22:51.263
I've transferred the money.

22:51.265 --> 22:56.465
But I have a few things
I want to do first,

22:57.765 --> 22:59.295
so I was wondering if you
could give me a rough idea

22:59.297 --> 23:01.030
in terms of timescale.

23:01.032 --> 23:03.796
William, this
isn't a good time.

23:03.798 --> 23:04.997
I'm at work.

23:04.999 --> 23:06.196
What?

23:06.198 --> 23:07.662
Right now?

23:07.664 --> 23:09.498
What, you're going to
kill someone right now?

23:10.797 --> 23:12.762
Wait, it's not me, is it?

23:12.764 --> 23:14.796
No, it isn't you.

23:14.798 --> 23:15.632
Oh.

23:16.698 --> 23:17.929
Bye, William.

23:42.898 --> 23:44.566
Book idea.

23:48.564 --> 23:53.566
An assassin who only kills
people who want to die.

23:55.230 --> 23:56.763
I was hoping it would be you.

23:56.765 --> 23:57.729
Have a nice death.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.596
He
holds death in his hand

24:02.598 --> 24:06.196
and delivers it with the
precision of a surgeon.

24:06.198 --> 24:08.096
I'm not quite dead.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.096
Oh my god!

24:09.098 --> 24:10.629
I'm so sorry, Mrs Rehmann.

24:10.631 --> 24:11.663
I'll have another go.

24:15.097 --> 24:17.196
Benevolently
shuffling lesser beings

24:17.198 --> 24:18.963
off their mortal coil.

24:18.965 --> 24:21.061
Oh, that's very good Penny.

24:21.063 --> 24:22.695
Oh, thank you, Clive.

24:22.697 --> 24:25.662
It will be if I
can get it right.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.663
- A
- hard-drinking enigma.

24:27.665 --> 24:30.195
Single malt his only companion.

24:30.197 --> 24:33.998
A man of action
and unique skills.

24:35.597 --> 24:38.798
Oh Les, you
didn't have anything else?

24:42.164 --> 24:44.763
He lies in wait,
ready to pounce.

24:44.765 --> 24:48.132
Stalking his prey with
a ruthless efficiency.

24:49.532 --> 24:50.863
A master of stealth.

24:52.597 --> 24:53.529
Do you want this?

24:53.531 --> 24:54.995
You don't want it?

24:54.997 --> 24:57.498
- A
- connoisseur of concealment.

24:59.631 --> 25:03.765
Moving in the shadows, he
sees all, but is never seen.

25:04.731 --> 25:06.629
The grim reaper.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.296
Abbadon the destroyer.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.699
To look at him is to look
into the face of death.

25:13.864 --> 25:15.763
A lone wolf.

25:15.765 --> 25:16.929
Taciturn.

25:16.931 --> 25:18.195
What the hell are you doing?

25:18.197 --> 25:19.630
I've only been gone
about five minutes.

25:19.632 --> 25:20.662
No, no.

25:20.664 --> 25:21.529
Sorry, Sir.

25:21.531 --> 25:23.065
It's already in the system.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.565
Oh to hell with you

25:26.697 --> 25:29.595
and your stupid hat and
your stupid scooter!

25:29.597 --> 25:30.665
Unknowable.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.499
He hasn't chosen this life.

25:35.964 --> 25:37.699
It has chosen him.

25:56.631 --> 25:57.829
Hello?

25:57.831 --> 26:00.263
Oh, is this
William Morrison?

26:00.265 --> 26:01.095
Yeah.

26:01.097 --> 26:02.196
Oh, thank god.

26:02.198 --> 26:03.532
You're not dead.

26:04.631 --> 26:05.629
I'm working on it.

26:05.631 --> 26:06.562
Well, that's great.

26:06.564 --> 26:08.529
I thought I might be too late.

26:08.531 --> 26:10.065
Sorry, who are you?

26:12.265 --> 26:15.162
My name is Ellie Adams and
I work at Steeden & Sons.

26:15.164 --> 26:16.296
The publishers?

26:16.298 --> 26:19.662
Yeah, I want to
talk to you about your book.

26:19.664 --> 26:20.729
What about it?

26:20.731 --> 26:21.731
I read it.

26:22.997 --> 26:23.830
Really?

26:23.832 --> 26:24.663
Yeah.

26:24.665 --> 26:25.596
The whole thing?

26:25.598 --> 26:27.128
Yeah.

26:27.130 --> 26:30.196
You're pretty fucked up.

26:30.198 --> 26:31.196
No offense.

26:31.198 --> 26:32.295
None taken.

26:32.297 --> 26:34.262
I want to set
up a meeting with my boss.

26:34.264 --> 26:35.098
How's next week?

26:37.197 --> 26:38.228
No!

26:38.230 --> 26:42.532
No, I can't, um,
anything sooner?

26:43.798 --> 26:45.262
Okay.

26:45.264 --> 26:47.563
Actually something just
canceled tomorrow lunchtime.

26:47.565 --> 26:48.795
How's that?

26:48.797 --> 26:50.595
Yeah.

26:50.597 --> 26:52.061
I should be able to make it.

26:52.063 --> 26:53.162
Perfect.

26:53.164 --> 26:54.996
Do you know Fantacci's?

26:54.998 --> 26:55.862
Yep.

26:55.864 --> 26:56.796
One o'clock?

26:56.798 --> 26:57.630
Okay.

26:57.632 --> 26:59.095
Great.

26:59.097 --> 27:00.595
Just please don't kill
yourself in the meantime.

27:00.597 --> 27:02.663
Or if you do, can
you let me know

27:02.665 --> 27:04.562
and I'll cancel the table?

27:04.564 --> 27:05.195
Thanks!

27:14.231 --> 27:15.065
Morning.

27:18.565 --> 27:20.696
Sorry, I was
having a sandwich.

27:20.698 --> 27:22.698
I just wanted to ask a favor.

27:24.063 --> 27:25.828
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

27:25.830 --> 27:27.295
No, no, not at all.

27:27.297 --> 27:30.763
I just wondered if
we could postpone?

27:30.765 --> 27:32.262
Postpone?

27:32.264 --> 27:33.195
Yes.

27:33.197 --> 27:35.563
I had a call from a publisher's

27:35.565 --> 27:37.129
and they're
interested in my book.

27:37.131 --> 27:40.896
They wanted to meet me next
week, but I said absolutely not

27:40.898 --> 27:45.898
So we're having lunch at
one tomorrow at Fantacci's.

27:47.632 --> 27:48.562
Do you know it?

27:48.564 --> 27:52.296
But you still want to die?

27:52.298 --> 27:53.229
Absolutely.

27:53.231 --> 27:54.662
Because we have a contract.

27:54.664 --> 27:55.961
You can plead all you
like, lots of people do,

27:55.963 --> 27:58.530
but it's non-refundable.

27:58.532 --> 28:00.962
You did read the small print?

28:00.964 --> 28:04.765
You're only alive because
I haven't killed you yet.

28:05.698 --> 28:08.532
It will be a temporary hiatus.

28:09.598 --> 28:10.865
It would mean a lot to me.

28:15.230 --> 28:16.530
Okay.

28:16.532 --> 28:17.662
Sure.

28:17.664 --> 28:20.229
Thank you, I
really appreciate it.

28:20.231 --> 28:21.232
All right.

28:37.997 --> 28:39.629
Hello, sir,
can I help you?

28:39.631 --> 28:41.695
Hello, I have a
meeting with Ellie Adams.

28:41.697 --> 28:45.031
The young lady
sitting right there.

28:46.997 --> 28:47.831
Oh.

28:51.264 --> 28:52.595
Ellie?

28:52.597 --> 28:55.630
You didn't kill yourself.

28:55.632 --> 28:56.599
I managed not to.

28:58.164 --> 28:59.965
Brian is on his way.

29:01.298 --> 29:02.131
Tell me.

29:03.531 --> 29:06.829
You've thought a lot
about dying, right?

29:06.831 --> 29:09.262
More than most.

29:09.264 --> 29:12.764
Would you rather be eaten
by sharks or mauled by a bear?

29:13.831 --> 29:17.998
Uh, I think sharks.

29:18.964 --> 29:20.199
They seem more efficient.

29:21.597 --> 29:23.529
I wouldn't recommend lions.

29:23.531 --> 29:27.296
I tried jumping into the lion
enclosure at the zoo once,

29:27.298 --> 29:29.563
but all the lions were asleep.

29:29.565 --> 29:31.865
After 10 minutes I had
to climb out again.

29:34.997 --> 29:35.831
That's funny.

29:39.632 --> 29:41.529
Did you know that there are
more people killed every year

29:41.531 --> 29:45.562
by hippos than by lions,
sharks and bears combined.

29:45.564 --> 29:48.662
I mean, that's an
embarrassing way to die.

29:48.664 --> 29:50.762
To be killed by a hippo.

29:53.597 --> 29:55.598
My parents were
killed by a hippo.

29:56.997 --> 29:58.061
Oh.

29:58.063 --> 29:58.897
Sorry.

30:04.664 --> 30:05.928
I'm joking.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.565
My parents weren't
killed by a hippo.

30:08.897 --> 30:09.828
Oh, ha.

30:09.830 --> 30:11.563
They died in a car crash.

30:11.565 --> 30:13.061
So, your book.

30:13.063 --> 30:16.465
You're very interesting

30:19.097 --> 30:22.562
In a good way?

30:22.564 --> 30:24.096
Ah, here comes Brian.

30:24.098 --> 30:26.262
Well, you can tell him
from me he's a fucking moron.

30:26.264 --> 30:27.729
In fact worse, he's an idiot.

30:27.731 --> 30:29.263
A big fucking idiot.

30:29.265 --> 30:31.161
No, idiot is worse than moron.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.295
Idiot is the worst.

30:32.297 --> 30:35.562
Officially, it's a medical term.

30:35.564 --> 30:37.961
Extreme mental retardation.

30:37.963 --> 30:42.965
Idiot, imbecile, moron,
that's the sequence.

30:43.863 --> 30:45.599
Do you know what's after moron?

30:47.131 --> 30:47.961
Cretin?

30:47.963 --> 30:50.095
No, cretin is different.

30:50.097 --> 30:51.962
Cretin is more of
a physical thing.

30:51.964 --> 30:55.132
Just do it will you
or you're both fired!

31:01.863 --> 31:04.761
Your mum's not retarded
or anything is she?

31:04.763 --> 31:05.795
My mum's dead.

31:05.797 --> 31:07.229
Oh, thank god for that!

31:07.231 --> 31:08.161
That would have been awkward!

31:08.163 --> 31:09.829
This is Brian Bentley.

31:09.831 --> 31:11.096
My boss at the company.

31:11.098 --> 31:12.562
We love the book.

31:12.564 --> 31:14.262
Fucking dark.

31:14.264 --> 31:15.761
It's dull by the way.

31:15.763 --> 31:17.263
I wouldn't say that.

31:17.265 --> 31:18.661
Admittedly I haven't read
it, but Ellie loves it.

31:18.663 --> 31:19.594
Says it could be huge.

31:19.596 --> 31:20.829
Are you on Twitter?

31:20.831 --> 31:21.794
I meant after moron.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.795
Oh, the retards thing!

31:23.797 --> 31:25.529
Yeah, that's right, dull.

31:27.863 --> 31:30.196
You know, I once had a
girlfriend who was dull.

31:30.198 --> 31:31.595
Officially...

31:31.597 --> 31:32.595
We were talking
about William's book.

31:32.597 --> 31:33.828
Oh, yeah.

31:33.830 --> 31:35.296
So look, we want to
turn it into a sort of

31:35.298 --> 31:37.562
Idiots Guide to Suicide.

31:37.564 --> 31:38.962
What do you think?

31:38.964 --> 31:40.561
Not medical idiots obviously.

31:40.563 --> 31:43.229
I mean, I doubt those
guys can fucking read.

31:43.231 --> 31:44.232
It sounds awful.

31:45.564 --> 31:47.161
That's not really what, no,

31:47.163 --> 31:49.829
Brian meant that we
want to use the core of

31:49.831 --> 31:52.029
your book to give
a personal insight

31:52.031 --> 31:53.694
into the world of suicide.

31:53.696 --> 31:56.629
Have you really tried to
kill yourself seven times?

31:56.631 --> 31:59.228
10, if you count
cries for help.

31:59.230 --> 32:00.628
Jesus!

32:00.630 --> 32:02.162
You don't seem that disturbed.

32:02.164 --> 32:03.629
When Ellie told me about this
I thought you'd be trying

32:03.631 --> 32:05.829
to cut your wrists
with the bread knife.

32:05.831 --> 32:07.594
You know there's a
bravery in your writing

32:07.596 --> 32:09.762
to acknowledge that the world's
obsession with the banal

32:09.764 --> 32:12.628
is simply a distraction
from the nagging fear

32:12.630 --> 32:14.465
that our existence
has no meaning.

32:15.663 --> 32:18.662
People are discontented
and lonely.

32:18.664 --> 32:20.499
I think your book will
connect with them.

32:21.597 --> 32:23.562
Plus people love
shit that's depressing,

32:23.564 --> 32:25.832
makes them feel better about
their own crappy lives.

32:27.031 --> 32:29.561
Hey, do you really think
you will kill yourself?

32:29.563 --> 32:30.595
Probably.

32:30.597 --> 32:31.795
Great.

32:31.797 --> 32:33.598
Just thinking we could coincide
it with a paperback release.

32:34.730 --> 32:37.029
Well, if he's going
to do it anyway!

32:37.031 --> 32:41.694
I actually wanted to ask
about posthumous publication?

32:41.696 --> 32:43.695
Just hypothetically.

32:43.697 --> 32:46.594
We really want
to work with you.

32:46.596 --> 32:48.096
I'm so pleased
you like my book,

32:48.098 --> 32:50.961
but this guide idea,

32:50.963 --> 32:52.661
it sounds like a lot of work

32:52.663 --> 32:54.562
and I don't have much
time at the moment.

32:54.564 --> 32:55.928
Killing yourself
keeping you busy?

32:55.930 --> 32:57.662
You wouldn't have
to do it all yourself.

32:57.664 --> 32:58.861
Ellie would be your editor.

32:58.863 --> 33:00.561
If that's okay?

33:00.563 --> 33:03.028
This is great
opportunity, mate.

33:03.030 --> 33:05.132
Once in a lifetime, ironically.

33:06.297 --> 33:07.694
This is a chance
for you to say

33:07.696 --> 33:09.561
what you want and be heard.

33:09.563 --> 33:10.729
Yes.

33:10.731 --> 33:13.095
What is that exactly?

33:13.097 --> 33:16.096
That death is nothing to fear.

33:16.098 --> 33:18.628
It's what we all have in common.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.761
There is something
reassuring in that.

33:20.763 --> 33:23.630
Makes me feel less adrift.

33:29.098 --> 33:30.961
Jesus Christ!

33:30.963 --> 33:32.263
I'm not publishing your book

33:32.265 --> 33:35.529
just because you
need a fucking hug.

33:35.531 --> 33:37.595
It's got to sell.

33:37.597 --> 33:39.061
That's the problem these days,

33:39.063 --> 33:41.829
everyone feels a need
to express every detail

33:41.831 --> 33:43.161
of their pathetic lives

33:43.163 --> 33:45.228
to remind us of their existence.

33:45.230 --> 33:47.595
I tweet therefore I am.

33:47.597 --> 33:50.695
No one fucking cares!

33:50.697 --> 33:52.661
I'd rather shoot
myself in the head

33:52.663 --> 33:53.295
than have to listen to
the opinions of these...

33:56.864 --> 33:57.798
Oh balls.

34:03.031 --> 34:05.529
William, get down!

34:05.531 --> 34:07.828
Have a good death.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.929
What are you doing?

34:10.931 --> 34:11.764
Cock.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.562
I think it's stopped.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.594
Aren't you going to thank me?

34:27.597 --> 34:29.228
For what?

34:29.231 --> 34:31.094
I just saved your life.

34:31.097 --> 34:33.032
I'm having mixed
feelings about that.

34:35.030 --> 34:35.862
Jesus.

34:35.864 --> 34:36.697
Poor Brian.

34:38.862 --> 34:40.161
Do you think he's dead?

34:40.164 --> 34:41.697
Half his face was missing.

34:44.197 --> 34:45.498
There goes my book deal.

34:48.563 --> 34:49.795
You smoke?

34:49.797 --> 34:51.565
I didn't think anyone
smoked any more.

34:54.664 --> 34:57.528
You know this is a
non-smoking restaurant.

34:57.530 --> 34:58.730
I don't think they'll care.

35:24.931 --> 35:25.798
Leslie?

35:27.298 --> 35:28.565
Hello, love.

35:30.631 --> 35:31.698
What is it?

35:33.864 --> 35:34.832
Oh, it's nothing.

35:35.998 --> 35:37.729
After 36 years of marriage

35:37.731 --> 35:39.765
I think I know
something when I see it.

35:42.864 --> 35:43.665
Well I,

35:44.831 --> 35:46.998
I made a terrible
mistake at work.

35:47.997 --> 35:49.964
Oh Les, don't worry.

35:52.098 --> 35:54.562
Everyone makes mistakes.

35:54.564 --> 35:55.961
Not me.

35:55.963 --> 35:56.832
Not like this.

36:01.264 --> 36:02.565
Harvey's going to kill me.

36:03.564 --> 36:06.228
Oh, I'm sure he'll understand.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.865
I mean, it's not like
anyone died, is it?

36:14.264 --> 36:16.065
I'll put the kettle on.

36:19.530 --> 36:20.762
You'll never guess
who else is entered

36:20.764 --> 36:22.561
her cushion into the
Southern Counties.

36:22.563 --> 36:23.895
Who?

36:23.897 --> 36:26.695
Only Morag effing Bleasdale.

36:26.697 --> 36:28.562
Who's Morag Bleasdale?

36:28.564 --> 36:29.965
Who's Morag Bleasdale?

36:31.531 --> 36:33.129
She's only the best needlecrafter
in the home counties!

36:33.131 --> 36:34.162
She's won everything!

36:34.164 --> 36:36.162
There's no way I'll beat her.

36:36.164 --> 36:37.065
Yes, you will.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.196
I knew I shouldn't
have done a cushion.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.661
I'm out of my comfort zone.

36:42.663 --> 36:43.594
I would have thought a cushion

36:43.596 --> 36:45.128
would make it more comfortable.

36:45.130 --> 36:47.261
This is not a joke, Leslie!

36:47.263 --> 36:48.995
Morag Bleasdale!

36:48.997 --> 36:51.628
Not to mention Sue
Simmons, and Clive!

36:51.630 --> 36:53.029
Don't forget Clive.

36:53.031 --> 36:57.061
He beat me twice last year
and that was just local,

36:57.063 --> 36:59.096
this is the Southern Counties.

36:59.098 --> 37:02.228
As I say,
it's not about winning.

37:02.230 --> 37:04.829
And like I say,
it is about winning.

37:06.163 --> 37:07.728
I'm not cross-stitching
a cushion

37:07.730 --> 37:10.098
for 30 hours to come unplaced!

37:12.564 --> 37:15.096
You are better
than Morag Bleasdale,

37:15.098 --> 37:18.098
Sue Simmons and Clive.

37:19.296 --> 37:20.630
They're really good.

37:21.564 --> 37:23.864
But you are better.

37:25.230 --> 37:26.231
Thank you.

37:31.563 --> 37:32.828
What are you doing?

37:32.830 --> 37:35.530
I'm just checking something.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.795
Now tell me
what happened at work

37:40.797 --> 37:42.465
and what I can do to help.

37:43.730 --> 37:45.862
No, that's all right, love.

37:45.864 --> 37:46.998
I'll sort it myself.

37:51.229 --> 37:55.832
To miss once was unlucky,
to miss again, unthinkable.

37:59.796 --> 38:02.662
Since signing the contract,

38:02.664 --> 38:04.665
his problems hadn't
seemed so bad,

38:05.864 --> 38:06.964
except one.

38:08.531 --> 38:09.965
And that could
happen at any moment.

38:30.063 --> 38:31.794
Hey.

38:31.796 --> 38:34.529
How do
you know where I live?

38:34.531 --> 38:35.562
It was on your manuscript.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.931
I thought we could
start work on your book.

38:47.797 --> 38:48.761
But I thought...

38:48.763 --> 38:50.097
I've got nothing else on.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.961
I'm on compassionate leave.

38:53.963 --> 38:56.064
You know, for the trauma.

38:58.130 --> 38:58.965
Can I have one?

39:02.229 --> 39:04.160
And are you?

39:04.162 --> 39:05.661
What?

39:05.663 --> 39:07.230
Traumatized?

39:11.097 --> 39:12.231
Oh yeah.

39:13.796 --> 39:15.127
Totally.

39:15.129 --> 39:18.561
Yeah, a man was shot
right in front of us.

39:18.563 --> 39:21.497
That's gonna, obviously it's...

39:23.163 --> 39:25.664
But I probably will
get promoted now, so,

39:27.197 --> 39:29.595
well, he was a total dick!

39:29.597 --> 39:31.262
And I mean, as I
said to the police,

39:31.264 --> 39:33.497
loads of people wanted him dead.

39:36.230 --> 39:38.528
Are you working
on something new?

39:38.530 --> 39:39.564
No, that's...

39:45.530 --> 39:48.194
Your know my friend does
these new writing nights.

39:48.196 --> 39:49.031
You should come.

39:50.263 --> 39:51.931
There's music, beer,

39:54.096 --> 39:55.564
other fuck ups.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.261
So how do you want this to work?

40:02.263 --> 40:03.262
I've had some ideas
on the structure.

40:03.264 --> 40:05.729
I think we should meet
every couple of days...

40:05.731 --> 40:08.731
That sounds great,
but I told you, I can't.

40:10.730 --> 40:11.595
Of course you can.

40:11.597 --> 40:14.128
No, I'm sorry.

40:14.130 --> 40:14.996
Do you really want to
be stuck in this flat

40:14.998 --> 40:16.762
your whole life?

40:16.764 --> 40:17.962
Look at it.

40:17.964 --> 40:19.194
It's no wonder you
want to kill yourself.

40:19.196 --> 40:20.294
You don't get it.

40:20.296 --> 40:23.695
I get that I
connected with your book

40:23.697 --> 40:25.798
and I think other
people will too.

40:27.597 --> 40:29.562
Isn't that what
you're looking for?

40:29.564 --> 40:33.531
Something to feel
less, what did you say?

40:34.697 --> 40:35.531
Adrift?

40:36.930 --> 40:38.928
But I...

40:38.930 --> 40:39.563
What?

40:42.062 --> 40:43.597
I have something to tell you.

40:45.597 --> 40:47.497
I employed the guy
who killed Brian.

40:53.531 --> 40:56.195
Why would you employ
someone to kill Brian?

40:56.197 --> 40:58.729
No, I employed him to kill me.

40:58.731 --> 41:01.231
But he missed and killed Brian.

41:03.997 --> 41:05.227
What?

41:05.229 --> 41:07.227
Well, I wasn't having
much luck on my own

41:07.229 --> 41:08.862
so I thought I'd outsource it.

41:08.864 --> 41:10.161
Outsource it?

41:10.163 --> 41:13.294
You outsource market research,

41:13.296 --> 41:14.995
you outsource website design,

41:14.997 --> 41:17.831
you don't outsource suicide.

41:18.830 --> 41:20.261
I did.

41:20.263 --> 41:22.564
What happens now Brian's
dead and you're not?

41:23.630 --> 41:24.464
I don't know.

41:25.229 --> 41:26.730
The contract lasts a week.

41:28.864 --> 41:29.928
Great!

41:29.930 --> 41:31.961
And what about our book?

41:31.963 --> 41:32.960
You know what?

41:32.962 --> 41:34.561
You have to postpone it.

41:34.563 --> 41:35.828
Post, what?

41:35.830 --> 41:36.794
Or call it off.

41:36.796 --> 41:38.227
I don't know.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.327
You got his number?

41:39.329 --> 41:41.630
You just, you call him and
tell him the deal's off.

41:43.097 --> 41:48.097
But I think it's a
non-refundable kind of thing.

41:48.831 --> 41:49.961
I signed a contract.

41:49.963 --> 41:51.161
Non-refundable?

41:51.163 --> 41:52.628
Mm-hmm.

41:52.630 --> 41:54.628
You've agreed to be
killed by a hitman,

41:54.630 --> 41:56.595
I doubt that's legally binding.

41:56.597 --> 41:57.598
Call him.

42:15.764 --> 42:16.598
Shit.

42:21.296 --> 42:22.694
Fucking thing.

42:28.063 --> 42:30.030
Um, hello.

42:32.030 --> 42:32.865
Hello.

42:34.097 --> 42:34.931
How are you?

42:36.962 --> 42:38.864
Yes, I'm fine.

42:39.831 --> 42:40.894
You?

42:40.896 --> 42:42.664
Good, thank you.

42:44.630 --> 42:48.695
In fact, I've been
thinking and I'm thinking

42:48.697 --> 42:50.565
that I might want
to call it off.

42:51.230 --> 42:52.064
What?

42:53.130 --> 42:54.595
Sorry about that.

42:54.597 --> 42:55.561
But you signed a contract.

42:55.563 --> 42:59.628
Yes, I know, but look,
things have changed...

42:59.630 --> 43:00.928
Didn't you read
the small print?

43:00.930 --> 43:02.561
We've got an agreement.

43:02.563 --> 43:03.762
We have a contract.

43:03.764 --> 43:05.194
It's not legally binding!

43:05.196 --> 43:06.594
Oh, Jesus Christ!

43:06.596 --> 43:07.794
Take some responsibility!

43:07.796 --> 43:09.562
I'm doing the best I can.

43:09.564 --> 43:13.695
I'm one kill away and now
you want to call it off.

43:13.697 --> 43:16.531
Oh look, I tell
you what, fuck you.

43:19.929 --> 43:20.765
We need to go.

43:38.129 --> 43:39.595
Oh!

43:54.296 --> 43:55.295
Here.

43:55.297 --> 43:56.131
What?

43:58.531 --> 43:59.794
Oi, what are you...

43:59.796 --> 44:02.529
No, I'm sorry but it's
already in the system.

44:02.531 --> 44:03.562
Oi!

44:04.197 --> 44:05.761
Go, go!

44:05.763 --> 44:06.729
Where are we going?

44:06.731 --> 44:07.894
I know somewhere!

44:20.029 --> 44:21.764
Oh, for God's sake.

45:21.631 --> 45:22.662
I'll do wine.

45:22.664 --> 45:23.598
You do fire.

45:30.929 --> 45:31.763
Hello, Les.

45:34.029 --> 45:34.863
Harvey.

45:36.930 --> 45:39.261
So, we're in a
bit of shit here.

45:39.263 --> 45:40.628
Harvey...

45:40.630 --> 45:41.227
You are the
source of that shit.

45:41.229 --> 45:42.561
You're a shit factory.

45:42.563 --> 45:44.793
An incontinent shit factory.

45:44.795 --> 45:46.227
But, I'm fixing it.

45:46.229 --> 45:47.529
How are you doing that?

45:47.531 --> 45:49.628
By shooting a traffic warden?

45:49.630 --> 45:51.161
That was an accident.

45:51.163 --> 45:52.629
You're a real black spot
at the moment, aren't you?

45:52.631 --> 45:54.661
Worse than the fucking A14.

45:54.663 --> 45:56.861
The problem, Leslie,
is that our business

45:56.863 --> 45:59.927
is life and death and we can't
afford to have accidents,

45:59.929 --> 46:01.860
understand?

46:01.862 --> 46:03.661
We're professionals.

46:03.663 --> 46:05.693
We don't miss.

46:05.695 --> 46:08.030
Whoever heard of an
assassin with a shaky hand?

46:09.530 --> 46:10.860
You don't see Michael
J Fox running around

46:10.862 --> 46:12.629
shooting people, do you?

46:12.631 --> 46:13.495
And why not?

46:13.497 --> 46:15.160
Because he'd be
fucking terrible at it.

46:15.162 --> 46:18.995
No, Michael J Fox sticks to
raising money for his charity.

46:18.997 --> 46:21.060
He doesn't even do
much acting anymore,

46:21.062 --> 46:25.928
which is a shame because I'm
a big fan of Michael J Fox.

46:25.930 --> 46:28.860
Back to the Future,
Secret of my Success...

46:28.862 --> 46:29.830
Stuart Little.

46:32.829 --> 46:33.661
Why mention that?

46:33.663 --> 46:34.861
Why bring that up?

46:34.863 --> 46:36.061
He's in it.

46:36.063 --> 46:38.262
Only the voice, only
the fucking voice.

46:38.264 --> 46:40.960
Now, if you'd said Doc
Hollywood, I'd agree with you.

46:40.962 --> 46:41.794
Teen Wolf.

46:41.796 --> 46:43.594
Teen Wolf, exactly.

46:43.596 --> 46:46.194
But he doesn't do films anymore

46:46.196 --> 46:47.128
because he knows
he's not up to it.

46:47.130 --> 46:49.228
Do you see what I'm saying?

46:49.230 --> 46:50.594
Not really.

46:50.596 --> 46:51.996
Let me explain.

46:53.130 --> 46:53.964
You're done.

46:56.962 --> 46:58.595
What do you mean?

46:58.597 --> 47:00.262
Okay,

47:00.264 --> 47:03.660
no there's no clearer
way I can say this.

47:03.662 --> 47:04.763
You are done.

47:06.531 --> 47:07.660
You can't fire me.

47:07.662 --> 47:09.595
You haven't made your quota.

47:09.597 --> 47:11.160
But I'm only one hit away.

47:11.162 --> 47:12.861
Listen Shakin' Stevens.

47:12.863 --> 47:15.060
You missed, twice.

47:15.062 --> 47:16.061
You've had a good run.

47:16.063 --> 47:17.198
But as of now...

47:26.097 --> 47:27.597
We even got you a present.

47:29.097 --> 47:29.964
Look at that.

47:31.130 --> 47:32.565
Fucking lovely.

47:36.063 --> 47:38.627
Wha, for shooting
a traffic warden?

47:38.629 --> 47:39.563
Come on!

47:39.565 --> 47:40.461
No one gives a fuck
about traffic wardens.

47:40.463 --> 47:43.161
No, you shot the womble
in the restaurant.

47:43.163 --> 47:45.861
This is the reason
the guild was set up

47:45.863 --> 47:47.895
and you've jeopardized
the entire thing.

47:47.897 --> 47:51.160
Rules, regulations, contracts,

47:51.162 --> 47:54.195
without those you're
just a tit with a gun.

47:54.197 --> 47:56.728
But the target ducked
when I took a shot at him.

47:56.730 --> 47:58.095
It could happen to anyone.

47:58.097 --> 47:59.660
To be honest it
could've been worse.

47:59.662 --> 48:02.465
There was a contract out
on the guy you shot anyway.

48:03.197 --> 48:04.028
Oh, Jesus.

48:04.030 --> 48:04.961
What are the chances?

48:04.963 --> 48:06.194
The universe works in ways

48:06.196 --> 48:08.529
that people like us
will never understand.

48:11.263 --> 48:12.465
Brian Bentley.

48:14.696 --> 48:16.498
Here, you can read all about it.

48:25.962 --> 48:26.831
So, um,

48:27.962 --> 48:30.560
if I completed the contract...

48:29.596 --> 48:30.462
Don't get cheeky.

48:30.464 --> 48:32.529
Pavel was furious
when he found out.

48:32.531 --> 48:34.696
He'd just put a
deposit on a new car.

48:38.030 --> 48:40.497
So, what happens now?

48:41.863 --> 48:43.128
You take your zimmer frame

48:43.130 --> 48:45.527
and fuck off into the
sunset of retirement.

48:45.529 --> 48:47.694
Just don't take up golf.

48:47.696 --> 48:48.764
Golf is for cunts.

48:50.096 --> 48:52.560
But if I finish this
contract I can make my quota.

48:52.562 --> 48:53.697
It's been reassigned.

48:57.196 --> 48:58.227
Who to?

48:58.229 --> 48:59.063
Ivan.

49:00.762 --> 49:01.629
Look at him.

49:02.795 --> 49:04.763
Like a fucking
bear with alopecia.

49:07.529 --> 49:09.231
They're hardcore,
these Russians.

49:10.264 --> 49:11.129
It's a different game now, Les.

49:11.131 --> 49:13.194
You're getting out
at the best time.

49:13.196 --> 49:14.262
But this is what I do.

49:14.264 --> 49:15.693
Not any more.

49:15.695 --> 49:16.627
This job means
everything to me.

49:16.629 --> 49:19.627
Killing people gives
me a reason to live!

49:19.629 --> 49:21.295
It's a terrible
thing, getting old.

49:21.297 --> 49:22.628
Please, Harvey.

49:22.630 --> 49:23.627
I'm begging you.

49:23.629 --> 49:24.561
It's so close.

49:24.563 --> 49:25.994
This is no way for me to go out.

49:25.996 --> 49:29.095
You can't fucking go around
fucking shooting people!

49:29.097 --> 49:30.895
It's not what we fucking do!

49:30.897 --> 49:33.961
What happened to you, Mr.
One-foot-in-the-fucking-grave?

49:33.963 --> 49:36.061
You were the best
and now look at you!

49:36.063 --> 49:37.261
Hanging around Beachy Head,

49:37.263 --> 49:39.995
handing out your
fucking business cards.

49:39.997 --> 49:41.465
It's desperate.

49:54.097 --> 49:55.161
There's no shame in it.

49:55.163 --> 49:55.964
We all get old.

49:57.197 --> 49:59.597
Now take the fucking clock.

50:03.862 --> 50:05.231
I'm not taking the clock.

50:07.596 --> 50:08.761
Take the fucking
clock, Leslie.

50:08.763 --> 50:11.897
Or you will find things getting
a whole lot fucking worse.

50:14.097 --> 50:14.931
No.

50:35.696 --> 50:37.231
He's
become a liability.

50:38.663 --> 50:40.863
Someone should shoot
him in the fucking head.

50:51.129 --> 50:51.930
Here.

50:54.596 --> 50:55.997
Did you try again?

50:57.595 --> 50:58.563
It passed.

51:01.795 --> 51:03.527
I failed to kill
myself so many times

51:03.529 --> 51:05.629
I began to think I
might be immortal.

51:06.863 --> 51:08.529
I guarantee
you're not immortal.

51:10.030 --> 51:12.198
You're just terrible at dying.

51:20.695 --> 51:21.629
Whose house is this?

51:23.996 --> 51:25.463
Ummm, no idea.

51:26.796 --> 51:28.295
What?

51:28.297 --> 51:30.560
I just really hope they
don't come home tonight.

51:30.562 --> 51:31.198
What?

51:32.596 --> 51:33.828
You can't go breaking
into people's houses!

51:33.830 --> 51:36.095
Yeah, and you can't go employing
an assassin to kill you,

51:36.097 --> 51:37.728
but shit happens.

51:37.730 --> 51:39.960
I'm sorry, okay?

51:39.962 --> 51:44.763
I thought it was the answer,
but it was a mistake.

51:46.796 --> 51:47.963
Relax, it's my house.

51:48.962 --> 51:49.863
I grew up here.

51:51.063 --> 51:54.464
It was my parents'
but now it's mine.

51:57.130 --> 51:58.497
How did they die?

51:59.696 --> 52:00.497
I told you.

52:01.197 --> 52:01.996
Car crash.

52:04.629 --> 52:05.231
God.

52:06.596 --> 52:07.597
I was dead too.

52:08.795 --> 52:10.864
For 10 seconds.

52:12.030 --> 52:12.864
Really?

52:13.963 --> 52:15.794
What was it like?

52:15.796 --> 52:17.063
It was only 10 seconds.

52:18.297 --> 52:21.697
Yes, but what
did it feel like?

52:24.629 --> 52:25.596
It felt like nothing.

52:26.663 --> 52:28.160
Literally nothing.

52:28.162 --> 52:29.697
A total empty void.

52:31.197 --> 52:32.031
Oh.

52:33.562 --> 52:34.596
My parents are dead too.

52:36.929 --> 52:38.660
Well, look at us.

52:38.662 --> 52:39.696
Two scarred orphans.

52:41.295 --> 52:42.497
They were crushed.

52:46.730 --> 52:47.664
Crushed?

52:49.930 --> 52:51.161
We went for ice cream.

52:52.963 --> 52:54.597
My parents were arm in arm,

52:56.963 --> 52:59.628
taking licks of each
other's ice creams,

53:01.795 --> 53:02.563
laughing.

53:05.296 --> 53:06.630
So much in love.

53:10.229 --> 53:11.863
They didn't see the piano fall

53:22.197 --> 53:24.464
Mum was splattered
all over the pavement.

53:26.830 --> 53:27.964
Dad was still alive.

53:29.562 --> 53:30.198
Dad, dad!

53:33.030 --> 53:36.864
He looked so surprised.

53:41.029 --> 53:41.864
Hold on, Dad!

53:43.262 --> 53:44.895
Come here, son.

53:44.897 --> 53:48.597
And I thought, "Oh
my god, this is it.

53:52.530 --> 53:56.629
"At this moment, on
the very edge of life,

53:57.596 --> 54:00.197
"he's about to give
me its great secret."

54:05.762 --> 54:08.063
But he just died.

54:10.730 --> 54:11.661
That's...

54:11.663 --> 54:12.894
That's life's great trick,

54:12.896 --> 54:15.895
to make you think
it'll last forever,

54:15.897 --> 54:18.597
that you might be the exception.

54:19.862 --> 54:23.563
That's what's so
unbearable, when you realize

54:25.695 --> 54:26.529
that you're not.

54:30.062 --> 54:30.896
Let's do it.

54:32.262 --> 54:33.793
What?

54:33.795 --> 54:34.627
Kill ourselves.

54:34.629 --> 54:35.464
What, now?

54:36.662 --> 54:38.163
Yeah, why not?

54:40.663 --> 54:42.828
Why are we struggling on?

54:42.830 --> 54:44.860
I mean, for what purpose?

54:44.862 --> 54:49.063
Best to just kill ourselves
now and get it over with.

54:52.062 --> 54:53.159
Up!

54:53.161 --> 54:53.996
Come on!

54:58.662 --> 55:01.561
Though if there
are reasons to live

55:01.563 --> 55:04.661
I'm not sure we'll find
them by killing ourselves.

55:04.663 --> 55:06.496
Seems counter-intuitive.

55:07.729 --> 55:10.561
I would think we would have
a better chance by living.

55:10.563 --> 55:13.060
Living as much as possible.

55:13.062 --> 55:14.863
Doing as much as possible.

55:15.962 --> 55:17.930
Before a piano
falls on our heads.

55:19.262 --> 55:20.828
But I'm sure you're right.

55:20.830 --> 55:22.797
You have thought
about it more than me.

55:27.629 --> 55:28.529
On three?

55:32.695 --> 55:33.529
One,

55:36.562 --> 55:37.197
two,

55:39.229 --> 55:40.061
three.

56:00.295 --> 56:02.496
Your feet are so cold!

56:08.563 --> 56:10.629
What've you got that for?

56:14.595 --> 56:15.763
I'm gonna book the cruise.

56:18.129 --> 56:20.628
I don't want to talk about it.

56:20.630 --> 56:24.226
I know you're upset,
but it's exciting.

56:24.228 --> 56:26.827
The start of the
rest of our lives.

56:26.829 --> 56:28.561
The start of the
end of our lives.

56:28.563 --> 56:29.393
Oh, Les, that's a bit...

56:29.395 --> 56:30.961
I just don't want
to talk about it.

56:30.963 --> 56:32.928
It's retirement, that's all.

56:32.930 --> 56:34.564
But it means I'm useless.

56:36.129 --> 56:39.528
Think of all the new
experiences waiting for you.

56:39.530 --> 56:40.828
You should learn to play golf.

56:40.830 --> 56:41.660
Ugghh!

56:41.662 --> 56:42.463
Golf is for...

56:44.595 --> 56:45.426
I mean, look at this!

56:45.428 --> 56:46.827
Look at this, do
you remember this?

56:46.829 --> 56:50.528
You gave this to
me, Christmas, 1997.

56:50.530 --> 56:53.661
Look, I was a the
top of my game.

56:53.663 --> 56:57.660
I had dominion
over death itself.

56:57.662 --> 56:58.496
And now?

56:59.296 --> 57:01.464
I'm just waiting to die.

57:02.663 --> 57:05.127
If I don't work, who am I?

57:05.129 --> 57:05.964
What am I?

57:07.295 --> 57:09.693
I mean, you must look at
me sometimes and think,

57:09.695 --> 57:11.760
"Where's the man I married?"

57:11.762 --> 57:12.895
You're right.

57:12.897 --> 57:15.126
You're not the man I married.

57:15.128 --> 57:18.094
The man I married didn't
wallow in self-pity.

57:18.096 --> 57:20.860
He did things on his own terms.

57:20.862 --> 57:22.661
I don't want to retire.

57:22.663 --> 57:24.660
Not yet, I'm not ready.

57:24.662 --> 57:25.694
Oh for god's sake!

57:25.696 --> 57:26.530
Then don't.

57:28.695 --> 57:30.528
I thought you wanted me to.

57:30.530 --> 57:31.427
I do.

57:31.429 --> 57:33.760
But not if you're
going to be miserable.

57:33.762 --> 57:35.727
I want you to want it too.

57:35.729 --> 57:38.261
Yeah, but I can't, Harvey is...

57:38.263 --> 57:39.761
You've got to show him.

57:39.763 --> 57:43.159
Finish the contract
and make your quota.

57:43.161 --> 57:46.597
Show him you've still
got the killer instinct.

57:49.563 --> 57:50.163
Done!

58:09.896 --> 58:13.059
Could you choose
how to you wanted to die?

58:13.061 --> 58:14.694
With Leslie?

58:14.696 --> 58:15.827
Yeah.

58:15.829 --> 58:16.959
Yes.

58:16.961 --> 58:18.894
There were lots of options.

58:18.896 --> 58:20.561
He had a brochure.

58:20.563 --> 58:22.593
A brochure?

58:22.595 --> 58:23.230
Yeah.

58:24.595 --> 58:25.995
What did you choose?

58:26.896 --> 58:29.193
Quick and painless.

58:29.195 --> 58:32.094
I didn't want that, but
it's all I could afford.

58:32.096 --> 58:33.561
What did you want?

58:33.563 --> 58:35.593
I wanted to be hit by a truck

58:35.595 --> 58:37.629
after pushing a
child out of the way.

58:40.563 --> 58:42.160
What's wrong with that?

58:42.162 --> 58:43.630
It's a bit extravagant.

58:44.729 --> 58:46.528
I thought it was heroic.

58:46.530 --> 58:47.329
It would mean something.

58:48.729 --> 58:50.560
But it wouldn't
be real, would it?

58:50.562 --> 58:51.461
Well...

58:51.463 --> 58:52.993
And what if you hadn't
got there in time?

58:52.995 --> 58:54.226
What do you mean?

58:54.228 --> 58:55.361
If you hadn't
got there in time.

58:55.363 --> 58:57.593
If you misjudged the speed
of the truck or something,

58:57.595 --> 58:59.261
you'd put a child in danger

58:59.263 --> 59:01.464
just so you could
have your dream death?

59:02.595 --> 59:05.293
Well, uh, I guess
the child wouldn't be

59:05.295 --> 59:06.361
in any real danger.

59:06.363 --> 59:08.627
How could the child
not be in any real danger

59:08.629 --> 59:10.596
if it's about to
be hit by a truck?

59:13.262 --> 59:15.294
I don't know the details.

59:15.296 --> 59:17.527
I guess the truck would
be going quite slowly.

59:17.529 --> 59:18.827
So you'd be saving a child

59:18.829 --> 59:20.593
that's not really in any danger

59:20.595 --> 59:22.563
from a truck going quite slowly.

59:24.129 --> 59:26.627
On a scale of things that
could be considered heroic,

59:26.629 --> 59:29.029
I doubt that would
score very highly.

59:31.195 --> 59:32.694
Hmmmm, I dunno.

59:32.696 --> 59:34.661
What were the other options?

59:34.663 --> 59:36.463
Oh, you know.

59:37.629 --> 59:40.729
Shot in the head,
strangled, poisoned.

59:41.961 --> 59:43.563
Anything more interesting?

59:44.896 --> 59:46.896
Stung by a scorpion?

59:48.096 --> 59:49.727
Melted in acid?

59:49.729 --> 59:52.059
Drowned in slurry?

59:56.096 --> 59:57.763
I've never met
anyone like you.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:02.127
Now, see what you
could've missed out on?

01:00:02.129 --> 01:00:03.831
And it only gets
better from here.

01:00:10.062 --> 01:00:11.994
Did you take your pills?

01:00:11.996 --> 01:00:13.093
You know what the doctor said.

01:00:13.095 --> 01:00:14.661
I don't want you
getting excited.

01:00:14.663 --> 01:00:16.528
Yes love, don't worry.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:17.860
What time is Clive coming?

01:00:17.862 --> 01:00:18.794
He should've been here by now.

01:00:18.796 --> 01:00:21.126
We have to register by 10.

01:00:21.128 --> 01:00:24.694
You really think it's up to
Southern Counties standard?

01:00:24.696 --> 01:00:26.160
I'm not embarrassing myself?

01:00:26.162 --> 01:00:27.794
Of course not.

01:00:27.796 --> 01:00:30.527
I think it's up to
national standard!

01:00:30.529 --> 01:00:31.660
I wish you were coming.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:33.261
I've made you some sandwiches.

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:34.728
And a flask of tea.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:36.226
And I thought, well,

01:00:36.228 --> 01:00:38.629
I thought this
might come in handy.

01:00:43.563 --> 01:00:45.660
Penelope O'Neil,

01:00:45.662 --> 01:00:48.894
I don't think it is possible
to love you any more than I do

01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:49.860
right now.

01:00:49.862 --> 01:00:51.761
And you'll be back tomorrow?

01:00:51.763 --> 01:00:52.993
Yeah.

01:00:52.995 --> 01:00:54.293
I'll do lamb
cutlets for dinner.

01:00:54.295 --> 01:00:56.193
Ahhh, my favorite!

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:57.661
Where are you going?

01:00:58.296 --> 01:00:59.497
That'll be Clive.

01:01:00.662 --> 01:01:01.693
Wish me luck!

01:01:01.695 --> 01:01:02.664
Good luck.

01:02:06.228 --> 01:02:07.728
See you tomorrow, boys

01:02:58.062 --> 01:02:59.661
World's strongest man

01:02:59.663 --> 01:03:02.060
and celebrity budgie
fancier Geoff Capes

01:03:02.062 --> 01:03:05.129
in the studio to
discuss his recessive...

01:03:32.195 --> 01:03:35.193
Now this, number three,
has a lovely kaleidoscope.

01:03:47.695 --> 01:03:48.696
Hello, is it on?

01:03:50.262 --> 01:03:51.563
Hello, yes, that's better.

01:04:07.296 --> 01:04:12.463
And in third place,
number 14, Sue Simmons.

01:04:12.996 --> 01:04:14.626
Well done, Sue!

01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:35.792
And in second place,

01:04:35.794 --> 01:04:40.293
not quite up to her usual
all-conquering standard,

01:04:40.295 --> 01:04:42.527
Morag Bleasdale!

01:04:42.529 --> 01:04:44.593
So sorry, Morag.

01:04:44.595 --> 01:04:45.959
Well done, Morag!

01:04:45.961 --> 01:04:46.792
Beautiful work.

01:04:50.862 --> 01:04:53.627
But as we all know its
not the taking part,

01:04:53.629 --> 01:04:55.560
it's the winning that counts.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.994
So the winner of this
year's Southern Counties

01:05:01.996 --> 01:05:04.859
Binnual Needlework and
Embroidery competition,

01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:08.862
cushion category is,
drum roll please.

01:05:18.196 --> 01:05:19.463
Hello, William.

01:05:23.695 --> 01:05:24.926
How did you...

01:05:24.928 --> 01:05:26.895
I told you
I was up to the job.

01:05:28.061 --> 01:05:29.593
But
everything has changed!

01:05:29.595 --> 01:05:30.497
I don't want to die.

01:05:33.928 --> 01:05:36.496
The irony is not lost on me.

01:05:37.629 --> 01:05:38.629
Who are you talking...

01:05:39.594 --> 01:05:40.627
Oh.

01:05:40.629 --> 01:05:41.559
Oh, great!

01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:43.294
Now I have to kill you both.

01:05:43.296 --> 01:05:44.227
No!

01:05:44.229 --> 01:05:45.827
Please, she won't say anything.

01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:46.659
Will you?

01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:47.496
She won't.

01:05:48.561 --> 01:05:49.159
I might.

01:05:49.161 --> 01:05:51.859
No, you won't!

01:05:51.861 --> 01:05:55.860
Okay, well, ummm,
you're definitely dying,

01:05:55.862 --> 01:05:57.527
so let's get that
out of the way first,

01:05:57.529 --> 01:06:00.560
and then I can work out
what to do with you.

01:06:00.562 --> 01:06:03.528
So, um, have a good death.

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:08.592
Oh!

01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:09.463
Sorry.

01:06:20.161 --> 01:06:20.794
Oh.

01:06:21.961 --> 01:06:23.660
Jesus, can't you turn it off?

01:06:23.662 --> 01:06:25.060
Yes, I really
have to take this.

01:06:25.062 --> 01:06:25.859
Sure.

01:06:25.861 --> 01:06:27.094
Go ahead.

01:06:27.096 --> 01:06:29.293
It's only my life that
we're dealing with here.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:33.093
Hello, sweetheart?

01:06:33.095 --> 01:06:35.626
Yes, uh, I'm sort of in
the middle of something.

01:06:35.628 --> 01:06:37.060
Oh, Les!

01:06:37.062 --> 01:06:37.927
Something terrible's happened.

01:06:37.929 --> 01:06:39.194
What?

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:40.462
Is this about the
Southern Counties?

01:06:43.096 --> 01:06:45.560
We've had a break in, Les.

01:06:45.562 --> 01:06:47.563
There's papers everywhere.

01:06:49.262 --> 01:06:52.528
And, Les, they've
killed the budgies.

01:06:53.195 --> 01:06:54.560
What?

01:06:54.562 --> 01:06:55.629
Is everything okay?

01:06:57.196 --> 01:07:00.527
They look like
they've been crushed.

01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:02.893
Ah, ah, all
right, I have to go.

01:07:02.895 --> 01:07:04.860
Oh Les,
who would do this?

01:07:04.862 --> 01:07:08.463
I'll work it out,
but ah, I have to go.

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.462
Someone killed my budgies.

01:07:18.629 --> 01:07:19.463
Budgies?

01:07:20.694 --> 01:07:21.792
Mm-hmm

01:07:21.794 --> 01:07:22.629
I'm sorry.

01:07:25.761 --> 01:07:27.660
So, where were we?

01:07:27.662 --> 01:07:28.959
Ah, yes!

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:47.159
Who the fuck are you?

01:07:47.161 --> 01:07:48.593
Well, thanks.

01:07:48.595 --> 01:07:50.529
That guy was going to kill us!

01:07:52.695 --> 01:07:53.529
Oh.

01:07:55.996 --> 01:07:56.830
What?

01:08:00.629 --> 01:08:03.163
Now, you shoot yourself.

01:08:04.561 --> 01:08:05.692
What?

01:08:05.694 --> 01:08:07.159
Why would I want to do that?

01:08:07.161 --> 01:08:08.559
Or I shoot her.

01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:10.626
Don't bring me into this.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:11.627
Okay, okay.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.160
Let's not...

01:08:13.162 --> 01:08:16.692
Wait, why do I have
to shoot myself?

01:08:16.694 --> 01:08:17.728
Why can't you do it?

01:08:31.694 --> 01:08:32.562
For suicide.

01:08:35.562 --> 01:08:37.027
You shot him

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:37.962
then you shot you.

01:08:39.661 --> 01:08:40.529
I was never here.

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:43.563
Ah yeah, makes sense.

01:08:44.528 --> 01:08:45.529
And you'll let her go?

01:08:46.662 --> 01:08:49.026
Well then I have no incentive.

01:08:49.028 --> 01:08:50.225
If you're going to
kill her anyway,

01:08:50.228 --> 01:08:51.162
okay, okay.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:54.527
Wait a minute.

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:55.893
You shot him with that gun

01:08:55.895 --> 01:08:58.229
so he can't shoot
himself with this gun.

01:09:01.694 --> 01:09:03.529
Yeah, she's got a point.

01:09:06.528 --> 01:09:07.626
I don't understand.

01:09:07.627 --> 01:09:10.627
You take this gun and
then you give me that one.

01:09:20.529 --> 01:09:22.260
Okay, now shoot.

01:09:22.261 --> 01:09:23.093
Okay, Jesus!

01:09:23.095 --> 01:09:24.595
Just let me,

01:09:26.627 --> 01:09:27.759
oh God.

01:09:27.761 --> 01:09:29.127
Will, what are you doing?

01:09:29.129 --> 01:09:30.660
Five.

01:09:30.662 --> 01:09:32.959
I just want you to know...

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:34.693
Four.

01:09:34.694 --> 01:09:35.960
I just want you to know
that ever since I met you

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:38.527
I haven't thought about
killing myself once.

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:39.893
Three.

01:09:39.895 --> 01:09:41.591
Thank you.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:42.229
Two.

01:09:43.794 --> 01:09:44.692
One.

01:09:57.794 --> 01:09:59.629
You killed my budgies.

01:10:10.962 --> 01:10:12.462
I think he's dead.

01:10:13.562 --> 01:10:14.596
Yeah.

01:10:15.828 --> 01:10:16.795
Are you okay?

01:10:18.262 --> 01:10:21.130
Oh, it's only a,
it's a flesh wound.

01:10:24.628 --> 01:10:27.659
Well, I suppose we'd
better get on with this!

01:10:27.661 --> 01:10:28.960
Oh fuck.

01:10:28.962 --> 01:10:30.726
What, but you just saved him!

01:10:30.728 --> 01:10:31.659
So I can kill him.

01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:32.592
It's my contract!

01:10:32.594 --> 01:10:34.692
It's not legally binding!

01:10:34.694 --> 01:10:36.693
Oh, you're not
going to shoot me.

01:10:36.695 --> 01:10:37.995
You can't even shoot yourself!

01:10:40.227 --> 01:10:41.592
Oh, give it here.

01:10:41.594 --> 01:10:42.660
Oh, this is
getting ridiculous.

01:10:42.662 --> 01:10:43.759
Put the gun down.

01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:46.159
You will not shoot that gun.

01:10:47.029 --> 01:10:47.829
Whoa, careful!

01:10:51.195 --> 01:10:52.995
Put the gun down.

01:10:55.595 --> 01:10:56.692
You put the gun down.

01:10:56.694 --> 01:10:57.659
I'm not putting the gun down.

01:10:57.661 --> 01:10:58.493
Why would I put the gun down?

01:10:58.495 --> 01:10:59.859
If you're not
putting your gun down

01:10:59.861 --> 01:11:01.593
there's no way I'm
gonna put this gun down.

01:11:01.595 --> 01:11:03.896
Then let's just stand here
until you bleed to death.

01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:08.027
Leslie, I really
appreciate all your efforts,

01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:10.192
but could we just call this off?

01:11:10.194 --> 01:11:11.526
If it's about the money, then...

01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:13.027
It's not about the money.

01:11:13.029 --> 01:11:13.928
Then what is it?

01:11:15.095 --> 01:11:16.760
I understand that you
have certain principles.

01:11:16.762 --> 01:11:18.793
If I don't complete this
contract by next week,

01:11:18.795 --> 01:11:22.559
I won't make my quota.

01:11:22.561 --> 01:11:23.795
And then I'll have to retire.

01:11:26.529 --> 01:11:27.463
Yeah well, umm,

01:11:28.996 --> 01:11:32.560
uh, no, the only way
out of this is to, uh,

01:11:32.562 --> 01:11:35.158
is to kill you both and
then say I never saw him.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.029
Maybe then I'll be
able to keep my job.

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:44.562
If she puts her gun down,
will you promise to let her go?

01:11:46.795 --> 01:11:48.229
My contract is with you.

01:11:56.829 --> 01:12:00.026
I wanted to die because
I had nothing to live for.

01:12:00.028 --> 01:12:01.862
And that's what I
was trying to find.

01:12:02.995 --> 01:12:03.895
And now I found it.

01:12:07.561 --> 01:12:09.196
And that's got to
be worth dying for.

01:12:14.294 --> 01:12:16.059
You really think too much.

01:12:18.961 --> 01:12:20.462
I want to thank you, Leslie.

01:12:21.895 --> 01:12:24.626
You were there for me when
I really needed someone,

01:12:24.628 --> 01:12:27.195
even though you were trying
to kill me at the time.

01:12:28.227 --> 01:12:29.729
Yes, you're welcome,

01:12:31.228 --> 01:12:33.760
but I still have to kill you.

01:12:33.762 --> 01:12:35.026
Okay.

01:12:35.028 --> 01:12:35.860
Wait!

01:12:35.862 --> 01:12:36.894
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:12:36.896 --> 01:12:38.125
What?

01:12:38.127 --> 01:12:39.593
What if we take
out a contract?

01:12:39.595 --> 01:12:40.226
What?

01:12:40.228 --> 01:12:41.063
On who?

01:12:42.628 --> 01:12:43.626
You mean on whom?

01:12:43.628 --> 01:12:44.462
On whom?

01:12:48.562 --> 01:12:50.693
Retrospectively?

01:12:50.695 --> 01:12:51.495
Obviously.

01:12:54.528 --> 01:12:58.560
Well, this is, uhh,
utterly irregular.

01:12:58.562 --> 01:12:59.960
Who's to know?

01:12:59.962 --> 01:13:02.463
Then you'll have your
contract and make your quota.

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:04.796
What about the money?

01:13:06.029 --> 01:13:08.193
I've got 2,000 pounds
in an escrow account

01:13:08.195 --> 01:13:09.062
you could have.

01:13:17.995 --> 01:13:19.996
Do you have any paper?

01:13:21.562 --> 01:13:22.626
Yes!

01:13:22.628 --> 01:13:24.029
Yes I do, I...

01:13:33.028 --> 01:13:34.562
I don't need it.

01:13:41.761 --> 01:13:43.463
We should take a
look at that ear.

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:46.595
I've probably got
some Savlon somewhere.

01:14:11.695 --> 01:14:14.159
Wait, one thing I
don't understand,

01:14:14.161 --> 01:14:15.830
how did you know where we were?

01:14:17.028 --> 01:14:19.760
Well, uh, there was a
background check on you.

01:14:19.762 --> 01:14:20.596
On?

01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:23.126
There isn't a...

01:14:23.128 --> 01:14:26.125
No, no, it wasn't you,
it was for your boss.

01:14:26.127 --> 01:14:28.829
Apparently he was
very unpopular.

01:14:30.194 --> 01:14:32.659
So he didn't
die because of me?

01:14:32.661 --> 01:14:33.760
Oh, yes he did.

01:14:33.762 --> 01:14:36.162
But someone would have got
to him sooner or later.

01:14:37.562 --> 01:14:38.995
What are you going to do now?

01:14:40.528 --> 01:14:42.596
I have an idea for a new book.

01:14:43.694 --> 01:14:45.061
The main character at least.

01:14:46.794 --> 01:14:48.462
You're a good man, William.

01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:50.962
I'm glad I didn't kill you.

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.560
Thanks, Leslie.

01:14:53.562 --> 01:14:55.193
I'm glad I didn't die.

01:15:04.561 --> 01:15:05.628
Hello, what's this?

01:15:08.594 --> 01:15:10.058
I was worried.

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.526
What happened?

01:15:11.528 --> 01:15:13.529
Oh, you should
see the other guy!

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:16.560
So?

01:15:16.562 --> 01:15:17.992
So?

01:15:17.994 --> 01:15:19.195
The Southern Counties?

01:15:23.662 --> 01:15:24.860
Ah, first place!

01:15:24.862 --> 01:15:25.926
You got first place?

01:15:25.928 --> 01:15:26.925
Yep.

01:15:26.927 --> 01:15:28.692
And Morag Bleasdale?

01:15:28.694 --> 01:15:29.629
Second.

01:15:30.562 --> 01:15:31.763
That's fantastic.

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:35.560
It's just the
Southern Counties.

01:15:35.562 --> 01:15:38.563
Ahhh, so now it's just
the Southern Counties!

01:15:39.695 --> 01:15:41.195
Oh, I am so proud of you.

01:15:58.695 --> 01:16:00.696
Hello
Penny, is Leslie home?

01:16:19.895 --> 01:16:23.760
Penny, could you give me
and Harvey a minute, please?

01:16:23.762 --> 01:16:24.693
You sure?

01:16:24.695 --> 01:16:25.929
Yes.

01:16:28.562 --> 01:16:30.593
Midsomer Murders
is on in a minute.

01:16:37.829 --> 01:16:39.796
So, why are you here, Harvey?

01:16:41.795 --> 01:16:42.629
You know.

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:44.894
No, I don't.

01:16:45.861 --> 01:16:46.992
You know.

01:16:46.994 --> 01:16:48.662
And I know you know.

01:16:49.861 --> 01:16:50.763
I don't know.

01:16:52.794 --> 01:16:55.225
Mr. Morrison is still alive.

01:16:55.227 --> 01:16:56.061
Really?

01:16:57.194 --> 01:16:59.159
And no one's heard from
Ivan the terrible hitman.

01:16:59.161 --> 01:17:03.592
Well, you can't trust
these foreign kids, can you?

01:17:03.594 --> 01:17:05.660
You should have asked
me to do the job.

01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:07.593
What do you take me for?

01:17:07.595 --> 01:17:10.925
I'm not one of your senior
fucking Alzheimer friends.

01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:13.659
I'm actually a
little bit impressed.

01:17:13.661 --> 01:17:15.229
I didn't think
you were up to it.

01:17:16.228 --> 01:17:17.659
I told you.

01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:19.527
Yeah, you did.

01:17:19.529 --> 01:17:21.663
And I told you to take
the fucking clock.

01:17:25.694 --> 01:17:27.094
You don't have to do this.

01:17:28.261 --> 01:17:30.125
Have a bit of
fucking pride, eh?

01:17:30.127 --> 01:17:31.663
No, I mean, um,

01:17:35.227 --> 01:17:36.061
I mean this.

01:17:37.662 --> 01:17:38.926
What is it?

01:17:38.928 --> 01:17:40.592
It's a contract.

01:17:40.594 --> 01:17:41.559
What?

01:17:41.561 --> 01:17:42.159
On Ivan.

01:17:42.161 --> 01:17:43.862
You must be fucking...

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:50.992
All right.

01:17:50.994 --> 01:17:52.692
Where's the money?

01:17:52.694 --> 01:17:54.959
I think you'll find two
grand of Mr. Morrison's

01:17:54.961 --> 01:17:56.627
in the escrow account.

01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:57.826
But that was...

01:17:57.828 --> 01:17:59.628
No, he's still alive
so it's his money.

01:18:00.794 --> 01:18:02.526
No, you can't take
on new contracts!

01:18:02.528 --> 01:18:03.660
You're retired.

01:18:03.662 --> 01:18:05.093
I hadn't made my quota!

01:18:05.095 --> 01:18:06.059
Now I have.

01:18:06.061 --> 01:18:07.959
You're taking the piss.

01:18:07.961 --> 01:18:11.992
Why can't you just retire
like a normal fucking person?

01:18:11.994 --> 01:18:13.195
I am an assassin.

01:18:14.629 --> 01:18:17.862
That's what I do,
and that's who I am.

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:20.929
You're a fucking dead man.

01:18:26.628 --> 01:18:27.995
Ah, like that is it?

01:18:31.228 --> 01:18:32.462
Under the table?

01:18:33.927 --> 01:18:35.559
Right now?

01:18:35.561 --> 01:18:37.228
Right now under the table?

01:18:38.761 --> 01:18:39.596
Take a look.

01:18:51.594 --> 01:18:52.628
Fuck.

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:56.496
Now, wait a sec, all right?

01:19:07.995 --> 01:19:08.825
Leslie!

01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:10.093
Please, Penny.

01:19:10.095 --> 01:19:11.125
Hasn't Midsomer
Murders started yet?

01:19:11.127 --> 01:19:13.627
It was a bit grisly.

01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:15.596
And I wanted to show
Harvey my cushion.

01:19:17.161 --> 01:19:22.162
I won first prize in the
Southern Counties Biannual

01:19:23.594 --> 01:19:26.792
Needlecraft and Embroidery
competition, cushion class.

01:19:26.794 --> 01:19:27.791
Oh yeah.

01:19:27.793 --> 01:19:30.058
What are they supposed to be?

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:33.992
They're turtle
doves, a mating pair.

01:19:33.994 --> 01:19:38.192
Interesting thing about turtle
doves is they mate for life.

01:19:38.194 --> 01:19:41.759
They stay together, grow old
together and when one dies,

01:19:41.761 --> 01:19:45.062
the other one tends
to die soon after.

01:19:46.095 --> 01:19:48.528
They absolutely need each other.

01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:50.563
Sweet really.

01:19:52.827 --> 01:19:53.661
Huh.

01:19:58.094 --> 01:20:01.560
Is that for Les?

01:20:01.562 --> 01:20:02.958
Look at that!

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.895
Oh!

01:20:04.927 --> 01:20:07.992
Isn't that something!

01:20:07.994 --> 01:20:09.061
Les?

01:20:09.894 --> 01:20:12.025
Isn't that something?

01:20:12.027 --> 01:20:14.758
I think he's a bit
scared of retirement.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.593
But I said to him,
it's exciting.

01:20:17.595 --> 01:20:19.726
Time to enjoy himself,
didn't I, Les?

01:20:19.728 --> 01:20:22.058
The start of the
rest of our lives.

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.495
Isn't that right, Les?

01:20:24.861 --> 01:20:27.758
Is that right, Leslie?

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:36.058
Did I tell you?

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.691
We're going on a cruise!

01:20:37.693 --> 01:20:38.826
'Round the whole world!

01:20:38.828 --> 01:20:40.862
Cape Town, Sydney,

01:20:41.794 --> 01:20:43.560
Nuku'Alofa.

01:20:43.562 --> 01:20:44.196
Hmmm?

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:45.926
It's in Tonga.

01:20:45.928 --> 01:20:47.626
Ah.

01:20:47.628 --> 01:20:50.825
It's a trip of a lifetime,
that's what they say.

01:20:50.827 --> 01:20:53.929
Awww, thank you
for this, Harvey.

01:20:55.127 --> 01:20:57.092
It'll look perfect
on the mantelpiece.

01:20:57.094 --> 01:20:59.995
Isn't that kind of Harvey, Les?

01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:15.529
Thank you, Harvey.

01:21:24.529 --> 01:21:25.562
Anyway,

01:21:28.593 --> 01:21:30.659
I'd best be off.

01:21:30.661 --> 01:21:32.062
Leave you to your evening.

01:21:33.227 --> 01:21:34.659
You not stopping
for tea, Harvey?

01:21:34.661 --> 01:21:35.892
We've got herbal.

01:21:35.894 --> 01:21:37.595
No, no, you're all right.

01:21:40.694 --> 01:21:42.029
Enjoy your retirement, Leslie.

01:21:44.561 --> 01:21:45.762
We're sorry to lose you.

01:21:48.693 --> 01:21:50.658
Send our love to Sandra.

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:51.495
Mmm.

01:22:04.027 --> 01:22:05.859
I'm not sorry.

01:22:05.861 --> 01:22:09.627
I know you loved your job,
but it's not all you are.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.692
At least not to me.

01:22:15.261 --> 01:22:17.161
What would I do without you?

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.093
I'm just pleased I
didn't have to stick him.

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.895
So, uh,
did they like it?

01:22:40.927 --> 01:22:42.293
Seemed to.

01:22:42.295 --> 01:22:44.725
They love the
assassin character.

01:22:44.727 --> 01:22:46.527
And they want to
meet you next week.

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:48.494
That's great.

01:22:49.227 --> 01:22:50.825
You can make that?

01:22:50.827 --> 01:22:53.627
Yes, I think I can make that.

01:22:55.693 --> 01:22:58.694
So this living thing's
really not that bad, is it?

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.158
Well, you never
know when a piano

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.627
is going to fall on your head.

01:23:15.694 --> 01:23:16.528
William!

01:23:24.627 --> 01:23:25.461
William!

01:23:29.528 --> 01:23:33.193
Call an ambulance,
call an ambulance!

01:23:33.195 --> 01:23:34.029
William!

01:23:34.994 --> 01:23:36.161
Is, is he...

01:23:38.694 --> 01:23:41.525
What, yes, yes,
he's fine, he's fine.

01:23:41.527 --> 01:23:42.962
You saved him.

01:23:44.261 --> 01:23:44.894
What about you?

01:23:46.561 --> 01:23:48.129
I've definitely felt better.

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:51.461
Here, lie down with me.

01:24:01.261 --> 01:24:02.461
Are they clapping?

01:24:06.527 --> 01:24:08.627
Yeah, they're clapping.

01:24:14.195 --> 01:24:15.029
Perfect.
