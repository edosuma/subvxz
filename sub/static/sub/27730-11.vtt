WEBVTT

00:08.356 --> 00:10.184
Previously
onStar Trek: Discovery...

00:10.227 --> 00:12.316
GEORGIOU:
So we're going
to the Ninth Circle of Hell

00:12.360 --> 00:13.665
to capture a Red Angel.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.537
Michael, the Red
Angel, it's you.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.495
Your parents were killed
because of me.

00:17.539 --> 00:18.757
My father was
a xenoanthropologist,

00:18.801 --> 00:20.542
my mother was
an astrophysicist.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.326
They wouldn't have been involved
in Section 31.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.502
I was careless. I should have
done more to protect your...

00:26.113 --> 00:27.853
Every moment you work
for Section 31,

00:27.897 --> 00:29.203
you're announcing who you are.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.943
I don't always agree
with their tactics,

00:30.987 --> 00:32.597
but I do believe
in their mission.

00:32.641 --> 00:34.034
The A.I. that infected Control,

00:34.077 --> 00:35.339
we have to assume
that it could reemerge

00:35.383 --> 00:36.340
at any time.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.345
BURNHAM: Captain, if we're going
to capture the Red Angel,

00:41.389 --> 00:42.651
I have to be the bait.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.480
Shutting down life support.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.274
Now!

01:08.155 --> 01:09.721
Mom?

01:19.035 --> 01:21.733
GABRIELLE:
X-ray analysis
and GRB emission confirm

01:21.777 --> 01:23.735
the supernova's imminent.

01:23.779 --> 01:28.175
Now harnessing the energy for
time crystal test nine beta.

01:28.218 --> 01:31.395
Charge is at 70% and rising.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.962
With any luck, we should be able

01:33.005 --> 01:34.964
to make our first jump
very soon.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.966
YOUNG BURNHAM:
Mom, dinner!

01:37.009 --> 01:38.968
Did you know a star
goes supernova

01:39.011 --> 01:40.970
every second in the universe?

01:41.013 --> 01:43.015
And it releases more energy
in a few seconds

01:43.059 --> 01:45.409
than our sun will
in ten billion years?

01:45.453 --> 01:47.019
I didn't.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.021
Will Alpha Lupi
go supernova soon?

01:49.065 --> 01:51.023
Three days feels like forever.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.765
The universe has its
own way of telling time,

01:53.809 --> 01:54.940
baby girl.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.072
You were almost late
for dinner.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.160
Oh, we'll forgive her.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.596
GABRIELLE:
Very generous.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.032
Is the crystal stable?

02:00.076 --> 02:01.773
How'd your calculations
turn out?

02:01.817 --> 02:04.254
I'll have more than enough
energy for initial trials.

02:04.298 --> 02:07.257
MIKE: Then we should celebrate.GABRIELLE: Yes, we should.

02:07.301 --> 02:10.259
MIKE:
Michael's so fascinated
by the supernova.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.654
Peas in a pod.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.438
I'm done for, by
the time she's 12.

02:14.482 --> 02:15.961
GABRIELLE:
You and me both.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.267
Come to the table, baby.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.226
Uh, Mom?

02:19.269 --> 02:20.401
There's a new light
in the sky.

02:20.444 --> 02:24.579
It's probably just
a meteor, honey.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.885
But it looks like it's landing.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.293
Go, go, go!

02:43.337 --> 02:45.948
Hide Michael, and
secure the lab!

02:45.991 --> 02:48.690
I'll buy us some time! Go!

02:48.733 --> 02:50.300
Dad!

02:54.391 --> 02:55.784
I need you to be brave.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.177
Stay in here,
don't make a sound.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.659
It's gonna be okay.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.270
Mommy?

03:03.313 --> 03:05.054
I love you, baby girl.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.366
Hey, hey. You're okay.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.673
You're safe.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.153
Welcome back, Commander.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.851
You were dead from toxic
asphyxiation for over a minute,

03:19.895 --> 03:22.289
and you received a high dose
of tachyon radiation.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.378
That'll give anyone a headache.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.466
How long was I out?

03:25.509 --> 03:26.728
Five hours.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.425
The Red Angel.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.342
I thought I saw my...

03:34.083 --> 03:36.303
It was me,
though, right?

03:36.346 --> 03:39.131
The bio-neural signature...CULBER:
There are, um,

03:39.175 --> 03:41.482
significant
biological similarities

03:41.525 --> 03:43.005
between, uh,

03:43.048 --> 03:45.050
mothers and daughters.

03:45.094 --> 03:48.053
Particularly
the mitochondrial DNA.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.273
What?

03:51.840 --> 03:53.798
That was real?

03:53.842 --> 03:55.626
GEORGIOU:
Yes, Michael.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.150
It's your mother.

04:03.504 --> 04:07.116
No.

04:07.159 --> 04:09.249
No, she died.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.383
She died.

04:13.427 --> 04:16.647
She-she died.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.868
I heard...

04:19.911 --> 04:22.305
And Leland, he...

04:22.349 --> 04:25.743
She...

04:25.787 --> 04:28.355
Where? I mean, where-where is...

04:28.398 --> 04:30.095
She's being cared for
down on Essof IV.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.228
CULBER:
Easy, easy.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.186
It's not safe for you
to beam down.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.319
Not until the effects of
radiation poisoning dissipate.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.104
I... I can't sit here.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.541
Your mom's unconscious

04:40.584 --> 04:41.933
but safe within
the containment field.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.675
Okay. How is this possible?

04:44.719 --> 04:45.981
You must have
a million questions.How could she survive?

04:47.112 --> 04:49.376
Is my dad alive, too?I'm asking you

04:49.419 --> 04:51.552
to be patient, Michael.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.597
BURNHAM:
My mom has been dead
since I was ten,

04:53.641 --> 04:55.730
you're telling me
she's actually alive.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.558
How can you expect me
to be patient?

04:57.601 --> 04:59.255
You woke...

04:59.299 --> 05:01.344
sooner than expected.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.432
What did you find?And I see

05:02.476 --> 05:04.434
you are yourself again.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.740
Commander Stamets
finished

05:05.783 --> 05:08.090
scanning
the Angel's exoskeleton.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.310
It contains a data module
with hundreds of mission logs,

05:10.353 --> 05:11.485
which Ensign Tilly
was able to download.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.443
I believe these will be
of interest.

05:13.487 --> 05:14.618
How many entries?

05:14.662 --> 05:16.925
841.

05:18.666 --> 05:19.841
You're the one to assess.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.369
See if you can
find any answers

05:26.413 --> 05:27.849
while we wait
for your mother to wake up.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.902
The room is sealed.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.862
No one will hear you.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.089
You're Control.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.265
I am,
in holographic form,

05:53.309 --> 05:56.094
indistinguishable
from any biological entity

05:56.138 --> 05:57.879
I might choose to represent.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.881
And how long do you think
that will last?

05:59.924 --> 06:03.014
They figured out
Admiral Patar wasn't real.

06:03.058 --> 06:06.191
There are 7,000 active ships
in Starfleet,

06:06.235 --> 06:08.411
all reliant
on the chain of command.

06:08.455 --> 06:11.109
That chain is
unquestioned, unbroken,

06:11.153 --> 06:12.633
unseen.

06:12.676 --> 06:15.679
Every instruction,
passed down through channels.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.855
In time,
even those who would not

06:17.899 --> 06:20.858
follow my agenda
knowingly... will.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.730
What am I doing here?

06:22.773 --> 06:24.775
When I eliminated Admiral Patar,

06:24.819 --> 06:27.996
it was easier
to simulate a Vulcan.

06:28.039 --> 06:31.391
Airiam's augmentation
allowed me a similar facade.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.829
But flesh is a different matter.

06:34.872 --> 06:38.963
There is an element of human
nuance I have not yet mastered.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.791
I require
a face and a body

06:40.835 --> 06:43.838
that will allow me
more freedom to operate.

06:43.881 --> 06:47.581
Your face. Your self.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.235
Never.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.933
I am my own man.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.936
A man who has demonstrated
with his every action

06:54.979 --> 06:56.416
a willingness to operate

06:56.459 --> 06:59.375
from several different truths
simultaneously.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.031
It has allowed you to make
questionable moral decisions

07:03.074 --> 07:07.470
while avoiding the destructive
power of human guilt.

07:07.514 --> 07:10.995
You believe in the ends
more than the means.

07:12.257 --> 07:14.564
That pattern of behavior

07:14.608 --> 07:16.914
is useful to me.

07:16.958 --> 07:20.265
Struggle... is pointless.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.138
You won't win.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.446
You joined Section 31
to keep a brutish universe

07:26.489 --> 07:28.056
on its knees, Captain.

07:28.099 --> 07:31.146
To maintain order
by any means necessary.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.975
Your evolution--
our evolution--

07:34.018 --> 07:36.934
is not a desecration
of that oath

07:36.978 --> 07:39.415
but its very fulfillment.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.722
YOUNG BURNHAM:
Mommy.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.116
GABRIELLE:
We'll be okay,
I know what to do.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.816
I can get us out of here
before they even arrive.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.252
I'm jumping back just an hour.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.733
Three, two, one!

10:33.981 --> 10:36.592
GABRIELLE:
950 years?

10:41.466 --> 10:43.468
Where the hell am I?

10:48.822 --> 10:50.650
GABRIELLE:
Mission log 009.

10:50.693 --> 10:54.088
Mike, Michael, I keep trying
to get back to you,

10:54.131 --> 10:56.438
but I can never manage to stay.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.092
Mission log 027...

10:58.135 --> 10:59.789
Mission log 039...

10:59.833 --> 11:01.748
Mission log 042.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.664
No matter how many times
I go back in time,

11:04.707 --> 11:06.448
I can't stay anywhere
permanently.

11:06.491 --> 11:11.583
The anchor keeps pulling me
back, 950 years away from you.

11:11.627 --> 11:15.587
There are no signs
of life anywhere.

11:15.631 --> 11:18.025
Antimatter detonation
across the galaxy

11:18.068 --> 11:20.810
indicates Control
wiped everything out.

11:20.854 --> 11:25.510
Vulcan, Andoria, Tellar Prime,
Deneva, Earth.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.338
This is Earth.

11:27.382 --> 11:30.211
As far as I scan, everywhere.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.822
I'm alone.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.003
Captain, I'm registering
gravimetric instability

11:40.047 --> 11:41.222
in the planetoid.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.006
Normal or abnormal occurrence?

11:43.050 --> 11:44.616
Uh, definitely abnormal.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.183
It is centered directly

11:46.227 --> 11:47.576
on our research facility.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.926
Mr. Saru, can you pinpoint
a possible cause?

11:49.970 --> 11:52.363
I believe, Captain,

11:52.407 --> 11:55.192
this is a classic example
of Newton's third law of motion.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.194
How every action has
an equal and opposite reaction.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.109
Sorry, it's just my
second favorite law

11:59.153 --> 12:00.850
of physics.
Uh, my first is, uh...

12:00.894 --> 12:02.547
We know that
both Dr. Burnham

12:02.591 --> 12:04.941
and her suit are tethered
to a point in the future.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.857
Our containment field
is holding her in the present.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.381
The tighter we hold,
the stronger time pulls back.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.253
In other words, we're playing
tug-of-war with the universe.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.820
Eventually,
we will lose.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.083
We have a gravitational problem
on Essof IV.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.084
I need power...

12:17.127 --> 12:18.650
Already on it, Commander.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.217
Divert all nonessential ship's
power to the surface.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.871
Give Commander Stamets
whatever he needs.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.830
Yes, Captain.How long before
the universe wins?

12:23.873 --> 12:25.832
Perhaps... an hour.
Two at the most.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.050
Commander, get down there

12:27.094 --> 12:28.225
and see what
you can do.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.097
Lieutenant Bryce,
tell Dr. Culber

12:30.140 --> 12:31.489
we're running out of time,
we need to wake up our patient.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.013
RHYS:
Aye, Captain.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.842
I need to talk to her
before we lose the chance.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.801
Our mission parameters
have changed.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.368
We set the trap assuming

12:40.411 --> 12:41.891
Michael Burnham
was the Red Angel.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.719
That turn of events
has altered our agenda.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.155
How?

12:45.199 --> 12:47.375
I saw Dr. Gabrielle Burnham's
corpse

12:47.418 --> 12:50.073
on Doctari Alpha
with my own eyes.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.075
What, you're saying this woman
isn't Gabrielle Burnham?

12:52.119 --> 12:53.773
I'm saying the woman
I saw is dead.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.600
We have no credible way
of knowing

12:55.644 --> 12:57.951
who or what or what that woman
down there really is.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.866
A clone, some
sort of unknown

12:59.909 --> 13:01.084
genetic replica...

13:01.128 --> 13:02.346
Maybe you simply
don't like

13:02.390 --> 13:04.087
the fact
that Admiral Cornwell

13:04.131 --> 13:06.089
placed her entirely
under Discovery'spurview.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.439
I don't need to remind you
that, if Control downloads

13:08.483 --> 13:11.138
the Sphere data embedded
in that ship's computer,

13:11.181 --> 13:12.835
it will achieve consciousness,

13:12.879 --> 13:14.794
and that is how this all starts.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.447
What if she was sent

13:16.491 --> 13:18.754
to take the data
back to Control?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.713
Or she came here to stop
Control from ever getting it.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.065
I know you both have feelings
for Michael Burnham.

13:25.108 --> 13:27.110
But we cannot afford to confuse

13:27.154 --> 13:29.286
what you believe
her motivations are

13:29.330 --> 13:31.854
with whomever that is
lying there.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.074
If she is a Trojan horse...

13:34.117 --> 13:38.121
Discovery'sdefenses would
prove woefully inadequate.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.123
I have faith
in Discovery'screw.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.821
Faith is not a strategy.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.431
I understand this seems
like betrayal,

13:43.474 --> 13:45.868
but we are the ones who need
to be holding that data.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.652
I have created
a secure area

13:47.696 --> 13:49.306
within our
data storage.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.091
The Control module
will never

13:51.134 --> 13:52.527
be able to access it.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.183
Get me that data, Tyler.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.880
If Captain Pike

13:57.924 --> 13:59.621
won't protect it...

13:59.664 --> 14:01.405
then we must.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.191
You want me to commit espionage

14:04.234 --> 14:05.845
against another Starfleet ship?

14:05.888 --> 14:07.672
That is the job we have chosen.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.805
If your connection to Michael
is giving you pause,

14:09.849 --> 14:12.677
I'll remind you that she is
being protected, too.

14:12.721 --> 14:16.029
She is more vulnerable
than anyone.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.596
Would you rather see
all sentient life

14:18.640 --> 14:21.556
in the galaxy destroyed
because we failed to act?

14:30.043 --> 14:32.697
You're quite resolute today.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.656
The times call for it.

14:41.228 --> 14:44.100
I built myself a home base
on a class M planet

14:44.144 --> 14:45.972
50,000 light-years away.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.930
Wherever I jump,

14:47.974 --> 14:49.279
the suit will always return me.

14:49.323 --> 14:50.846
Right back here.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.674
No preexisting technology,

14:52.717 --> 14:54.458
so Control can't find me here.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.548
I'm safe for now.

14:57.592 --> 15:00.508
But Einstein couldn't
have been more right.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.292
Time's motion depends
on the observer.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.207
On the action.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.209
The people I was able
to move from Earth

15:06.253 --> 15:08.168
to Terralysium,
as they call my planet,

15:08.211 --> 15:10.344
are thriving.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.389
Their survival means
that time is fluid.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.304
The future can be changed.

15:14.348 --> 15:17.394
Maybe the past as well.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.396
I have to believe
I'll see you again,

15:19.440 --> 15:20.920
my sweet daughter.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.400
Mission log 799.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.535
No matter what I do,
I can't stop Control

15:27.578 --> 15:29.493
from getting the Sphere data.

15:29.537 --> 15:32.714
I've even tried
destroying the Sphere.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.542
But it's impossible.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.848
I taught my child
never to despair.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.372
But if I can't change

15:38.415 --> 15:40.940
this one thing...

15:40.983 --> 15:44.378
The only thing
I can think of now...

15:44.421 --> 15:46.771
is to...

15:46.815 --> 15:49.949
undo its gravitational binding.

15:49.992 --> 15:53.778
And put the Sphere
in Discovery'spath.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.955
In the hopes
that they'll find a way

15:55.998 --> 15:58.783
to keep the data safe.

16:05.138 --> 16:08.141
The Sphere data came to us
because of you.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.064
Come in.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.331
I trust the mission logs

16:24.374 --> 16:26.028
have proven valuable.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.508
And perhaps difficult.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.031
Did you need something?

16:29.075 --> 16:31.991
Dr. Culber's about
to report from the surface.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.167
I believe your mother
is regaining consciousness.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.213
TILLY:
Commander Stamets
reporting gravimetrics...

16:37.257 --> 16:38.867
To be continued, Ensign.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.174
Mr. Bryce.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.132
Put Dr. Culber
on-screen, please.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.308
Aye, Captain.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.310
Did you manage
to wake her up?

16:47.354 --> 16:50.139
Yes. Dr. Burnham has regained
consciousness.

16:50.183 --> 16:53.055
Tachyon radiation levels
are beginning to normalize.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.839
She's asking
to speak to you, sir.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.232
We'll be right down.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.625
I'm sorry, Commander.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.670
Dr. Burnham is asking
to speak with the captain.

16:59.714 --> 17:02.108
And only the captain.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.031
She's my mother.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.076
I'm sorry,
I'm just the messenger.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.164
There are so
many questions

17:15.208 --> 17:17.036
that need to be answered
right now.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.255
Whatever her reasons are
for not wanting to see me,

17:19.299 --> 17:20.560
I should be the one asking.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.214
I understand
your position.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.565
But I think we need to follow
Dr. Burnham's lead here.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.175
I must agree
with the captain.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.089
I'm not asserting
my rights as a daughter.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.613
That would be childish.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.093
I am the one who
knows her best.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.617
But there may be other
variables to consider.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.706
I mean, she's
experienced something

17:35.750 --> 17:37.143
that no one else
in history ever has.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.494
Look.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.365
I've been reinstated
for all of five minutes,

17:42.409 --> 17:44.585
and I did it because I
wanted to help, but...

17:44.628 --> 17:46.500
you have to consider
the fact that the person

17:46.543 --> 17:50.330
your mother was before she
stepped into that time suit...

17:50.373 --> 17:51.853
may not be who she is now.

17:51.896 --> 17:54.551
Who better to
gauge that than me?

17:54.595 --> 17:56.118
I understand
your desire to see her,

17:56.162 --> 17:57.772
but for now
we do this her way.

17:57.815 --> 18:01.471
We need to establish trust if
we're going to get any answers.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.866
Please.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.563
You're staying
on board, Commander.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.130
I'm sorry.

18:08.174 --> 18:11.090
You'll have to watch
from the feed.

18:17.183 --> 18:18.401
Sir, you won't be able to enter

18:18.445 --> 18:20.229
the containment field,
but you can

18:20.273 --> 18:22.013
go right up to it.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.408
It's taking more
and more energy to hold

18:25.452 --> 18:27.236
Dr. Burnham
and the suit in place.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.412
Sooner or later,
probably sooner,

18:29.456 --> 18:30.892
our reserves will run out.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.242
And she'll be pulled
into the future again.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.420
Then I'd better talk fast.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.945
Dr. Burnham.
I'm Captain...

18:40.989 --> 18:42.730
Captain Christopher Pike.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.253
USS Enterprise.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.777
In temporary command
of Discovery.

18:46.821 --> 18:50.433
But soon you'll return
to your ship.

18:50.477 --> 18:53.306
I could say more
about your future,

18:53.349 --> 18:55.134
but you won't like it.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.789
Well, we're,
uh, not here to talk about me.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.139
GABRIELLE:
Then let's talk about the fact

19:00.182 --> 19:01.401
that I came here
to save my daughter,

19:01.444 --> 19:03.098
and you deceived me.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.970
PIKE:
Michael risked her life
to bring you here.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.756
We understand the threat
to sentient life.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.279
You understand nothing.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.412
As long as there's
any possibility

19:12.455 --> 19:15.545
of Control gaining access
to the Sphere data,

19:15.589 --> 19:17.199
everything will die.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.679
Always.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.420
I put that Sphere
in Discovery'spath

19:20.463 --> 19:21.986
so you could
protect the data,

19:22.030 --> 19:23.988
but even that
didn't work.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.903
You have to let me keep trying.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.992
PIKE:
Then let us help you
finish the mission.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.081
Tell us what the signals mean.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.083
I don't know about any signals.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.827
PIKE:
In the sky?
Uh, seven simultaneously,

19:36.871 --> 19:38.394
and then each one led us...

19:38.438 --> 19:40.788
I said I know nothing
about them.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.138
You want to help?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.140
Delete the Sphere archive.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.838
Without that data, the
A.I. cannot evolve.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.492
We're protecting it.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.015
Don't you understand?

19:51.059 --> 19:53.017
Time is a living thing.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.019
It has gravity and will

19:55.063 --> 19:57.761
and it's pulling
the A.I. closer.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.024
I've seen it with my own eyes.

20:00.068 --> 20:03.376
And you believe
that deleting the archive...

20:03.419 --> 20:05.116
will stop the A.I.
from evolving?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.683
Yes.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.207
But if you miss something,

20:08.250 --> 20:10.687
I'll have no choice
but to try again

20:10.731 --> 20:12.559
and again and again.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.865
You have to release me.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.564
I can't do that.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.174
I'm sorry,
Doctor.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.263
You're a ghost to me,
Captain Pike,

20:21.307 --> 20:23.047
one of hundreds

20:23.091 --> 20:26.355
of trillions that fill
a galactic graveyard.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.098
So...

20:30.141 --> 20:33.057
until you're willing
to do what I say,

20:33.101 --> 20:36.322
exactly as I say,

20:36.365 --> 20:38.454
this conversation is over.

20:42.980 --> 20:45.287
SARU:
Deleting the Sphere archive

20:45.331 --> 20:48.595
is tantamount to burning
the Library of Alexandria.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.771
Or the Bibliotheca Corviniana.

20:50.814 --> 20:54.078
This knowledge is invaluable.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.906
Protecting it,
safeguarding it,

20:55.950 --> 20:58.257
is a central tenant
of the Federation

20:58.300 --> 21:00.694
and our sworn duty
as Starfleet officers.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.262
Unless that knowledge poses
a clear and present danger

21:03.305 --> 21:04.698
to all sentient life.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.221
From a security perspective,
I have to ask,

21:06.265 --> 21:07.483
what if Dr. Burnham,

21:07.527 --> 21:09.659
your mother, has an agenda
we're not aware of?

21:09.703 --> 21:11.182
BURNHAM:
The one thing that I witnessed

21:11.226 --> 21:13.533
about my mother, over and over,

21:13.576 --> 21:15.709
was her relentless
pursuit of facts.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.841
So if she believes
that deleting the archive

21:17.885 --> 21:20.931
will defeat the A.I., I have
no doubt that she's right.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.545
I agree with Burnham.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.764
Deleting the archive
is our best option.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.288
I will proceed.

21:33.596 --> 21:34.597
What's happening?

21:36.164 --> 21:38.297
I do not know, Captain,
the system is not responding

21:38.340 --> 21:39.776
as it should.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.736
The data memory core is
partitioning itself.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.129
Reconfiguring its
security directives

21:45.173 --> 21:46.522
into a new
language matrix.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.219
How can it do that?

21:48.263 --> 21:50.352
The intelligence is a remnant
of the Sphere itself.

21:50.396 --> 21:51.962
When we first
encountered the Sphere,

21:52.006 --> 21:53.964
its data was
determined to survive.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.575
And it still is.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.141
The archive is
building firewalls

21:57.185 --> 21:59.622
around itself
using xeno-encryption

21:59.666 --> 22:02.408
taken from its own
historical language database.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.932
Can you work around it?He wouldn't be able to.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.629
He needs a linguistic key.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.372
The encryption is based on a
language from a civilization

22:10.416 --> 22:13.332
that hasn't existed
for a thousand centuries.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.724
It seems, Captain,

22:14.768 --> 22:17.988
the archive will not allow
itself to be destroyed.

22:18.032 --> 22:19.381
Keep trying, Mr. Saru.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.688
We cannot allow
that data to survive.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.655
Mission log 271.

22:32.699 --> 22:34.353
Spock can understand me.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.485
I jumped back into his childhood

22:36.529 --> 22:39.749
and warned him about Michael
dying in the forest.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.491
I haven't been able
to communicate with anyone else.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.020
Spock's Vulcan logic training
in human emotions

22:50.064 --> 22:51.761
seem to give him
the psychological balance

22:51.805 --> 22:53.502
to comprehend my existence.

22:53.546 --> 22:57.114
And his dyslexia
allows him to process

22:57.158 --> 22:59.029
the effects
of atemporal dysplasia.

22:59.073 --> 23:02.424
In all of time...

23:02.468 --> 23:05.775
Spock may be the only person
who can help me.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.347
L'tak terai.

23:16.133 --> 23:17.700
Dyslexia.

23:17.744 --> 23:20.790
I spent my entire childhood
attempting to conceal

23:20.834 --> 23:23.227
my human failings
from those around me.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.055
It was never a failing.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.928
It was precisely
what allows you

23:27.971 --> 23:29.843
to process those visions
of the future.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.629
You helped Discoverychart
a new course.

23:34.978 --> 23:37.154
One that brought
my mother back to me.

23:37.198 --> 23:39.156
One that may very well

23:39.200 --> 23:42.116
enable us to save the future.

23:44.945 --> 23:47.251
I was wrong to judge you...

23:47.295 --> 23:50.820
as unfit to process
your own emotions.

23:52.518 --> 23:53.649
It was...

23:53.693 --> 23:54.694
Petty.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.480
Unmerited.

24:00.351 --> 24:03.703
I can only imagine
what you must be feeling.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.880
I need to see my mother, Spock.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.491
You have questions,

24:09.535 --> 24:12.059
beyond the scope of our
mission, that deserve answers.

24:12.102 --> 24:14.322
Let us speak to the captain.
Together.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.458
The Red Angel is awake.
It's only a matter of time

24:19.501 --> 24:23.113
before she-- it, whatever
it is-- tries to take that data.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.551
You are the only one
standing between survival

24:25.594 --> 24:26.769
and obliteration.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.075
Is that in any way vague?

24:28.118 --> 24:29.468
When they tried to delete
the Sphere data,

24:29.511 --> 24:30.599
it protected itself.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.819
This is more complicated
than I thought.

24:32.862 --> 24:33.950
I find that hard to believe.

24:33.994 --> 24:34.995
Find it however you want.

24:35.038 --> 24:35.996
I'm not going to do this.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.606
It doesn't feel right to me.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.999
Is that in any way vague?

24:41.001 --> 24:43.133
No. You made the right call.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.135
Stay on that ship
and keep me in the loop.

24:45.179 --> 24:46.485
Good work, Mr. Tyler.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.925
Because of how little time
we have, I'm obligated

24:51.968 --> 24:53.796
to let you try this.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.451
Either she knows more about the
signals than she understands,

24:56.495 --> 24:58.584
or her lack of knowledge
suggests they may have been

24:58.627 --> 25:00.194
created by the
A.I. itself,

25:00.237 --> 25:02.588
maybe to mislead
or confuse us.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.851
Or there is a third variable
we have yet to realize.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.896
Which makes this conversation
all the more pressing.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.161
"Time is out of joint.

25:11.205 --> 25:13.816
O cursed spite, that I was
born to set it right."

25:13.860 --> 25:15.862
Hamlet.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.429
Hell yeah.

25:18.473 --> 25:19.692
Energize.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.714
No.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.240
No.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.635
This is like a dream.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.506
Did you delete
the archive?

25:53.160 --> 25:55.205
Did you destroy it?

25:55.249 --> 25:57.207
We couldn't.

25:57.251 --> 25:59.601
But we're finding
a solution.

25:59.645 --> 26:00.950
I knew it.

26:00.994 --> 26:04.171
This is why I told
him to let me go.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.346
Hey, hey.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.785
Please.

26:09.829 --> 26:12.048
It's been 20 years.

26:12.092 --> 26:14.311
Talk to me.

26:14.355 --> 26:15.791
Is Dad...?Stop.

26:15.835 --> 26:19.055
People think time
is fragile.

26:19.099 --> 26:23.407
Precious. Beautiful.

26:23.451 --> 26:26.541
Sand in an
hourglass, all that.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.412
But it's not.

26:28.456 --> 26:32.678
Time is savage.
It always wins.

26:32.721 --> 26:36.595
So this... is meaningless.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.600
No, this matters.

26:41.643 --> 26:45.255
You and me, here.

26:45.299 --> 26:47.910
Now matters.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.392
I know you're
asking yourself

26:51.435 --> 26:52.915
how, after,
after all these years

26:52.959 --> 26:54.438
of wishing for a mother,

26:54.482 --> 26:56.266
you could, you could
give her up,

26:56.310 --> 26:57.920
now that she's
finally reappeared?

26:57.964 --> 27:00.227
How could I?

27:00.270 --> 27:02.142
Easy.

27:03.752 --> 27:06.450
Neither of us has a choice.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.757
So you want to have
this conversation one day,

27:08.801 --> 27:10.106
the right way?

27:10.150 --> 27:12.935
Get me out of here.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.763
I need to try again
to alter the timeline.

27:14.807 --> 27:19.115
You reached out to Dad and me
through space and time.

27:19.159 --> 27:22.118
You never gave up on us.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.511
Why are you giving up on me now?

27:23.554 --> 27:25.774
Haven't you learned anything
from those failures?

27:25.818 --> 27:27.950
My God!
The stubbornness!

27:27.994 --> 27:29.430
Where do you think
I got it from, Mom?

27:31.432 --> 27:32.781
It's what kept you going
when you thought

27:32.825 --> 27:35.044
you were all alone
in the universe.

27:35.088 --> 27:37.481
You were going to get back
to your family.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.483
To me.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.877
I am standing right here.

27:41.921 --> 27:44.140
Right now.

27:44.184 --> 27:45.576
I don't know what
you've been telling yourself

27:45.620 --> 27:49.145
all these years, but I let you
go a long time ago.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.278
I had to.

27:52.279 --> 27:54.411
I've seen you die
a hundred times.

27:54.455 --> 27:57.197
And I'll see you die
a hundred more.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.026
That is my life and my prison.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.552
I can't hope anymore.

28:04.595 --> 28:08.077
I don't believe you.

28:08.121 --> 28:11.211
There's only
the bigger picture now.

28:11.254 --> 28:12.603
Nothing else.

28:31.144 --> 28:34.582
BURNHAM:
How much longer until
the containment field fails?

28:34.625 --> 28:37.977
43 minutes. We've increased
power to the field,

28:38.020 --> 28:40.544
but the gravitational pull
on Dr. Burnham and the suit

28:40.588 --> 28:42.590
is also increasing.

28:42.633 --> 28:43.983
We could give you guys
more power.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.549
Would that make a difference?

28:45.593 --> 28:49.423
I'm channeling my inner Isaac
Newton, and I'm sorry to say,

28:49.466 --> 28:52.165
it wouldn't, equal and opposite
reactions being what they are.

28:52.208 --> 28:56.343
SPOCK:
Dr. Burnham has been focused
on trying to destroy the Sphere.

28:56.386 --> 28:59.215
Perhaps there is a reason
she has thus far failed.

28:59.259 --> 29:01.565
You think we're going about this
the wrong way?

29:01.609 --> 29:04.525
Fourth century Earth philosopher
Lao Tze said,

29:04.568 --> 29:07.049
"Water is the softest thing,
yet it can penetrate mountains."

29:07.093 --> 29:09.748
An illustrative truth.
What appears immutable

29:09.791 --> 29:12.925
is not: a mountain,
the Sphere, time.

29:12.968 --> 29:15.579
In this case,
I wonder if time itself

29:15.623 --> 29:18.191
may provide the answer.Instead of fighting time,
we go with it.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.280
Stop trying
to destroy the Sphere,

29:20.323 --> 29:22.412
and merge it right
into the river of time itself.

29:22.456 --> 29:24.066
You mean send it
so far into the future

29:24.110 --> 29:25.285
it can't do us any harm?

29:25.328 --> 29:27.548
I collected sensor data
from Dr. Burnham

29:27.591 --> 29:29.245
when she first arrived.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.204
The Red Angel
suit has

29:31.247 --> 29:33.772
almost limitless quantum
computational power.

29:33.815 --> 29:36.600
Literally infinite storage.Meaning...

29:36.644 --> 29:39.386
you can transfer the Sphere
archive into the suit,

29:39.429 --> 29:41.910
program a destination beyond
Dr. Burnham's anchor point

29:41.954 --> 29:44.260
and let the wormhole
take it forever?

29:44.304 --> 29:46.132
Perpetual infinity.

29:46.175 --> 29:49.091
Control will never get the
data in order to evolve.

29:49.135 --> 29:52.312
But my mother is connected to
the future, just like the suit.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.880
What happens to her?To sever your mother

29:54.923 --> 29:58.405
from her space-time requires
the energy equivalent of...

29:58.448 --> 29:59.928
a supernova.

29:59.972 --> 30:03.802
But we do have
another...

30:03.845 --> 30:05.934
massive source of exotic energy.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.415
The dark matter particles.We may be able

30:08.458 --> 30:12.462
to modify a transporter enhancer
with dark matter.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.247
Yes, to pierce
the timestream long enough

30:14.290 --> 30:16.945
to lock on Dr. Burnham and
beam her into our space-time.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.947
Permanently.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.995
I like science.

30:24.648 --> 30:27.086
They would send the suit
into the future

30:27.129 --> 30:29.479
and allow Dr. Burnham to remain.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.481
We cannot allow that.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.701
Dr. Burnham.

30:33.744 --> 30:36.660
You're truly threatened by her.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.010
And why aren't you?

30:38.053 --> 30:39.533
You've always held
a superior note

30:39.576 --> 30:41.622
because you exist in
two different universes.

30:41.665 --> 30:44.625
This woman exists
across time.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.845
She's seen how you've
lived, how you'll die.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.630
She... is the
definition of power

30:49.673 --> 30:51.893
you once were.Get to the point.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.678
Shoot all of that data into
the future in hopes that
nothing will find it

30:54.722 --> 30:58.334
poses an unacceptable risk
to the larger mission.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.860
Mm. Interesting turn of phrase.

31:01.903 --> 31:05.385
A mission you should
understand in your bones.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.387
You want her gone.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.171
Yes, and so do you.

31:09.215 --> 31:10.825
There is nothing she
hasn't witnessed.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.914
There is nothing
she does not have,

31:12.958 --> 31:14.829
including Burnham's devotion.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.483
She has supplanted
you, Commander,

31:16.526 --> 31:19.094
and she will supplant you
in every incarnation.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.748
And Tyler?

31:20.791 --> 31:22.924
He has limits.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.665
You do not.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.798
Let me guess.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.626
If I place this
near the Angel suit,

31:29.670 --> 31:31.280
we can steal Discovery's
data transfer

31:31.324 --> 31:32.673
without their knowledge.

31:32.716 --> 31:34.849
And once the download
is complete,

31:34.893 --> 31:36.982
this amplifier
will self-destruct,

31:37.025 --> 31:38.984
destroying the time suit

31:39.027 --> 31:40.899
and Dr. Burnham.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.857
As a Terran...

31:42.901 --> 31:45.468
you should be able
to see the logic.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.340
And if she is
who she claims to be...

31:47.383 --> 31:48.819
Then you are still

31:48.863 --> 31:51.953
only the second most powerful
woman in the universe.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.737
Is that who youwant to be?

31:59.613 --> 32:01.397
Contact me

32:01.441 --> 32:04.705
once you've placed the device,
so I can begin the upload.

32:20.547 --> 32:23.724
What are you doing, Christopher?

32:23.767 --> 32:27.423
Michael, what are they planning?

32:27.467 --> 32:30.818
They're transferring
the Sphere data to your suit.

32:32.037 --> 32:35.083
Which they will then send
into the future.

32:35.127 --> 32:38.608
They think that's the way
to protect us all.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.262
Are you here to kill me,
Philippa?

32:40.306 --> 32:41.263
Would I tell you

32:41.307 --> 32:43.178
if that were the case?

32:43.222 --> 32:44.614
No.

32:44.658 --> 32:46.616
I just want to talk
to you privately

32:46.660 --> 32:48.575
and see up close

32:48.618 --> 32:51.882
the woman Michael has mourned
for 20 years.

32:51.926 --> 32:54.973
I've seen you sacrifice
yourself for her,

32:55.016 --> 32:58.280
surrendering your own life
without a moment's hesitation.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.935
I thank you for that.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.806
You have obviously
confused me

33:02.850 --> 33:06.549
with my sentimental
prime-universe counterpart.

33:06.593 --> 33:07.594
I'm Terran.

33:07.637 --> 33:11.119
Self-sacrifice is not our way.

33:11.163 --> 33:12.991
I know exactly who you are

33:13.034 --> 33:14.818
and what you're capable of.

33:14.862 --> 33:17.560
I doubt I would sacrifice
my life to save the galaxy.

33:17.604 --> 33:18.866
You'd be surprised

33:18.909 --> 33:21.390
what you'd do for
the people you love.

33:23.392 --> 33:26.482
Quite the feat
of engineering:

33:26.526 --> 33:28.006
simple,

33:28.049 --> 33:29.659
elegant,

33:29.703 --> 33:32.010
yet incredibly
powerful.

33:32.053 --> 33:35.361
The suit is DNA-strand encoded.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.319
It won't operate
for just anyone,

33:37.363 --> 33:39.756
in case you were thinking
of taking it for a spin.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.150
I get my thrills
in other ways.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.370
But time travel must be

33:44.413 --> 33:46.067
an elixir of
some kind.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.590
Intoxicating enough

33:47.634 --> 33:50.028
to make one forget
about domestic matters.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.030
A child, perhaps?

33:56.599 --> 33:58.514
Your mother
didn't teach you how to look

33:58.558 --> 34:00.690
but not touch, I see.My mother taught me

34:00.734 --> 34:03.171
many different things
in our universe.

34:03.215 --> 34:04.868
Above all,

34:04.912 --> 34:06.914
she taught me to survive.

34:10.612 --> 34:12.266
MAN:
We're at five percent.

34:12.311 --> 34:13.703
Six percent.

34:13.746 --> 34:15.705
Seven percent.

34:15.748 --> 34:17.098
Is that...?

34:17.141 --> 34:19.100
Sphere data. Yes.

34:20.406 --> 34:21.929
Monitor it for me.

34:21.972 --> 34:24.366
We leave orbit the
moment it's complete.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.458
So we've met.

34:30.503 --> 34:32.896
Most people say "I'm
pleased we've met."

34:32.940 --> 34:35.377
Most people are predictable.

34:35.420 --> 34:38.380
Philippa, I want your
word on something,

34:38.424 --> 34:40.469
mother to mother.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.780
I rarely make promises.

34:46.822 --> 34:48.650
That's why I'm asking you.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.436
You love her.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.830
Promise me
you'll take care of her.

34:53.873 --> 34:56.746
Perhaps you'll find a way
to look after her yourself.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.574
Not as long as the A.I. exists.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.489
It considers me
an unacceptable risk

35:00.533 --> 35:02.361
to the larger mission.

35:02.404 --> 35:03.840
LELAND:
It poses

35:03.884 --> 35:06.495
an unacceptable risk
to the larger mission.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.375
I wondered why
we lost our feed.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.159
Technology can be
so unreliable.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.118
Have fun with...
whatever that is.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.728
GABRIELLE:
When were you planning

35:21.771 --> 35:23.817
to tell me you were
downloading the Sphere data

35:23.860 --> 35:26.776
into my suit?It's a radical idea,
I know, but...

35:26.820 --> 35:28.778
It's a brilliant plan.
I'll be able to safeguard

35:28.822 --> 35:31.607
the archive in perpetuity now.No, Mom.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.957
You won't have
to give up your life.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.263
We modified
the transporters

35:35.307 --> 35:37.961
to beam you permanently
into the present.

35:38.005 --> 35:39.789
We'll send the suit
into a future

35:39.833 --> 35:41.617
where Control
can never reach you.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.445
No.

35:43.489 --> 35:45.926
If your plan fails,
Control wins.

35:45.969 --> 35:48.233
There'll be no one there
to stop it.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.278
We can't take that risk.

35:50.322 --> 35:51.932
This will not fail.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.977
I need you
to hear me:

35:54.021 --> 35:56.458
I am not losing you again.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.509
Why are you contacting me
on a secure channel?

36:03.552 --> 36:06.729
GEORGIOU:
How much data has been
transferred to our ship?

36:08.209 --> 36:09.341
22%.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.735
This is about Leland, isn't it?

36:12.779 --> 36:14.346
What I'm about to tell you

36:14.389 --> 36:16.609
is the first real test
of our relationship, Mr. Tyler.

36:16.652 --> 36:19.220
Betray me,

36:19.264 --> 36:21.091
and I'll live long enough
to hunt you down

36:21.135 --> 36:24.138
and kill you slowly. Understood?

36:24.182 --> 36:26.053
I've been killed
before, Georgiou.

36:26.096 --> 36:29.056
You're just telling me I'll have
time to enjoy the scenery.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.641
STAMETS:
I've retrofitted these pattern
enhancers with dark matter.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.643
That should provide enough
energy to beam Dr. Burnham

36:50.686 --> 36:53.472
out of her native
space-time into ours.

36:53.515 --> 36:54.690
But we only have

36:54.734 --> 36:57.258
enough power
for one attempt.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.826
So, theoretically,
this should work.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.393
It will work.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.699
Then we shut off
the containment field

37:03.743 --> 37:06.963
and let the suit
take the data away forever.

37:07.007 --> 37:10.576
Time's not on our side, Michael.

37:10.619 --> 37:14.057
Mom, whether you like it or not,
I'm gonna save you from this.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.712
Mostly I'm gonna save you
from yourself.

37:32.772 --> 37:36.210
I remember the white dress
you wore the day you graduated.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.739
How could you know?

37:43.783 --> 37:45.350
I watched you

37:45.393 --> 37:48.396
when you first beamed
aboard the Shenzhou

37:48.440 --> 37:51.573
with Sarek.

37:51.617 --> 37:53.183
When you finally learned
the Vulcan salute

37:53.227 --> 37:55.795
from Spock as a child.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.669
When you were alone and crying

38:00.713 --> 38:04.194
because all the other Vulcan
children had rejected you.

38:04.238 --> 38:07.894
I was there when you
read Alice in Wonderland

38:07.937 --> 38:10.331
out loud to yourself
on your 11th birthday,

38:10.375 --> 38:13.421
pretending to read
it to your father

38:13.465 --> 38:15.336
and to me.

38:15.380 --> 38:19.297
I heard you, baby. I heard you.

38:19.340 --> 38:23.126
And when that creature
came for you on Vulcan,

38:23.170 --> 38:25.041
I was there.

38:25.085 --> 38:29.785
I have been there through all
those moments and so many more.

38:29.829 --> 38:34.790
Seeing you gave me
strength and resolve.

38:34.834 --> 38:38.838
Seeing you reminded me
of what I was fighting to save.

38:38.881 --> 38:42.668
I have been fighting
for you, Michael.

38:44.234 --> 38:46.889
To get back here to you.

38:49.544 --> 38:52.199
But I can't come home now,
honey.

38:52.242 --> 38:54.244
Not yet.

38:57.291 --> 39:02.775
Not until this thing
is gone forever.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.455
Oh, Mom...

39:37.549 --> 39:39.420
TYLER:
You did it.

39:39.464 --> 39:40.726
The data transfer's stopped.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.205
GEORGIOU:
Good.

39:42.249 --> 39:44.469
Now go find out what Leland does
in the dark.

39:44.512 --> 39:45.818
Say please.

40:28.948 --> 40:30.645
You won't win.

40:30.689 --> 40:31.951
Leland said the same thing.

40:40.481 --> 40:41.569
Commander Stamets is ready, sir.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.005
Prepare to transport...BRYCE:
Captain.

40:43.049 --> 40:45.181
Priority message
from the Section 31 ship.

40:45.225 --> 40:46.835
On-screen.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.365
Leland.

41:04.374 --> 41:06.028
It's too late.

41:30.183 --> 41:31.532
I can beam them now, Captain.

41:31.576 --> 41:34.317
They're Dr. Burnham's
only defense.

41:34.361 --> 41:35.841
Captain, we have a problem.

41:35.884 --> 41:38.104
It'll have to wait.
Dr. Culber, Dr. Pollard,

41:38.147 --> 41:39.671
stand by for incoming wounded.Sorry, Captain,
this cannot wait.

41:39.714 --> 41:40.759
The Section 31 ship

41:40.802 --> 41:42.021
is diverting our data transfer.

41:42.064 --> 41:44.197
How much Sphere data
have they downloaded?

41:46.895 --> 41:48.854
37% thus far.

41:48.897 --> 41:50.508
Captain, gravity is
fluctuating wildly.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.248
The field can't
hold much longer.

41:54.424 --> 41:56.601
He's taking the Sphere data.

41:56.644 --> 41:58.298
Drop the containment field.
I'll go back and stop him.

41:58.341 --> 41:59.691
BURNHAM:
We're not going to do that.

42:14.096 --> 42:15.707
No!BURNHAM:
Mom,

42:15.750 --> 42:17.491
stay down.

42:19.275 --> 42:20.755
Michael!

42:29.068 --> 42:31.461
Come on, I got you,
I got you.

42:31.505 --> 42:33.507
Come on, over-- come here.

42:36.684 --> 42:38.556
Captain, we cannot stop
the data transfer.

42:38.599 --> 42:39.992
How much data
has he downloaded now?

42:40.035 --> 42:41.515
45%. 46.

42:41.559 --> 42:42.995
The transfer speed
is increasing.

42:50.306 --> 42:52.265
Can we still pull my mom
into our timestream?

42:52.308 --> 42:53.614
He destroyed the
control station.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.311
You need to destroy
the containment field.

42:55.355 --> 42:56.530
Without the suit,

42:56.574 --> 42:57.792
he cannot take the data.

42:57.836 --> 42:59.315
If we do that,
you get yanked back.

42:59.359 --> 43:00.621
And then you don't have

43:00.665 --> 43:02.101
a suit to navigate
the timestream.

43:02.144 --> 43:03.363
STAMETS:
He'll kill her, Michael.

43:03.406 --> 43:05.757
At least this way
she would have a chance.

43:06.801 --> 43:07.933
SPOCK:
The transfer's being controlled

43:07.976 --> 43:09.630
by something
within the facility.

43:09.674 --> 43:11.414
PIKE:
Come up with another solution.

43:11.458 --> 43:13.591
We haven't come this far
to lose everything now.

43:23.122 --> 43:25.603
If we each shoot
one of the discs,

43:25.646 --> 43:26.865
the power disruption
will release

43:26.908 --> 43:27.953
the containment field.

43:29.215 --> 43:31.043
You have to let me go, Michael.

43:31.086 --> 43:33.785
It's the only way each of
us has a chance to survive.

43:39.225 --> 43:41.444
I'll find you, Mom.

43:41.488 --> 43:43.708
It'll be okay.

43:47.494 --> 43:49.757
I love you.

43:49.801 --> 43:52.412
I love you, too, baby girl.

43:55.284 --> 43:57.243
Ready.

43:57.286 --> 43:58.984
Now.

44:43.289 --> 44:44.333
Burnham to Discovery.

44:44.377 --> 44:45.552
Four to beam up.

44:47.119 --> 44:48.686
Then blow this place to hell.

44:50.122 --> 44:52.559
Landing party
on board, Captain.Fire torpedoes.

44:52.602 --> 44:54.430
Aye, sir. Firing torpedoes.

45:03.570 --> 45:05.528
Direct hit, sir.

45:05.572 --> 45:07.182
The Essof facility
has been destroyed.

45:07.226 --> 45:09.010
Captain.

45:09.054 --> 45:11.534
I detected a transporter signal
from the surface

45:11.578 --> 45:13.362
to the Section 31 ship.

45:14.363 --> 45:16.714
Damn it.
Lock on a pursuit course.

45:16.757 --> 45:18.628
They've masked their
warp signature, sir.

45:18.672 --> 45:20.805
There's no way to pursue.

45:20.848 --> 45:23.024
Captain, I've picked up
a distress beacon

45:23.068 --> 45:25.810
from an escape pod.
One life sign.

45:25.853 --> 45:28.377
Identified as Ash Tyler.

45:28.421 --> 45:30.728
When the timestorm passes,

45:30.771 --> 45:33.121
I'll come back for you,
baby girl.

45:33.165 --> 45:35.733
For you and your father.

45:35.776 --> 45:37.386
I promise.

45:45.743 --> 45:49.181
Leland received 54%
of the Sphere data.

45:49.224 --> 45:51.444
Significant,

45:51.487 --> 45:53.794
but as the captain has stated,
we will continue the fight.

46:00.540 --> 46:02.542
She was right.

46:06.285 --> 46:08.678
What fight are we supposed
to be continuing, Spock?

46:08.722 --> 46:11.464
Everything we try fails.

46:12.465 --> 46:15.424
Now, with no suit...

46:15.468 --> 46:18.079
no time crystal...

46:20.255 --> 46:23.606
...it'll always be
one step ahead of us.

46:23.650 --> 46:27.610
Respectfully,
Dr. Burnham was incorrect.

46:27.654 --> 46:30.657
Now does matter.

46:32.659 --> 46:36.576
What happened before
no longer exists.

46:36.619 --> 46:39.797
What will happen next
has not yet been written.

46:39.840 --> 46:42.495
We have only now.

46:44.497 --> 46:46.847
That is our greatest advantage.

46:49.937 --> 46:53.636
What we do now
here in this moment

46:53.680 --> 46:57.292
has the power to
determine the future.

46:57.336 --> 47:00.818
Instinct and logic together.

47:00.861 --> 47:04.996
That is how we will defeat
Control in the battle to come.

47:05.997 --> 47:08.086
We will find a way.

47:08.129 --> 47:11.829
All of history can change
with our next move.

47:21.316 --> 47:23.231
The board is yours, Michael.
