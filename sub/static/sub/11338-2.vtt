00:07.167 --> 00:08.868
Run, you can make it!

00:08.934 --> 00:10.367
Run! come on!

00:15.200 --> 00:17.000
Next.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.601
Uh, darrin call.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.701
Oh, i don't have anything.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.601
No, no, no.
i've got a refill left.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.000
Could you just--
it's call.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.100
Can you just
check that again?

00:36.167 --> 00:38.000
I have one refill.

00:40.701 --> 00:42.434
No, no, i'm sorry.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.434
It's not--that ain't good.

00:45.501 --> 00:48.868
That's not good.
that's not--it's just--

00:50.467 --> 00:51.968
Are you ok?

00:52.033 --> 00:54.601
Make it stop! just--

00:54.667 --> 00:57.267
Make it--

00:57.334 --> 00:59.067
I need to make it stop!

00:59.133 --> 01:00.033
Mr. call--

01:00.100 --> 01:01.300
Aren't you gonna help me?!

01:01.367 --> 01:02.734
Here--yes, here.
i'm sorry.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.634
Just please--
please stop. stop.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.200
That's not it!

01:06.267 --> 01:07.868
That is not it!

01:07.934 --> 01:10.200
[groans]

01:10.267 --> 01:11.434
Hey.

01:11.501 --> 01:13.400
Hey.
i just--

01:13.467 --> 01:14.701
I just, uh--
hey.

01:14.767 --> 01:15.868
Relax.

01:15.934 --> 01:17.200
It's ok.
i just--

01:17.267 --> 01:19.067
It's ok.

01:23.033 --> 01:24.167
Uhh! uh!

01:24.234 --> 01:26.501
Aah! god!

01:26.567 --> 01:28.334
Uhh!
woman: oh, my god!

01:28.400 --> 01:30.734
Oh, my god,
are you all right?

01:30.801 --> 01:32.934
Look what you've done!

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Uhh!

01:35.067 --> 01:37.501
Please, somebody help him!

01:37.567 --> 01:38.834
Aah!

01:38.901 --> 01:40.701
[grunting]

01:40.767 --> 01:42.701
Put the knife down, now.

01:42.767 --> 01:44.467
Aah!

01:45.467 --> 01:47.067
Aah!

01:47.901 --> 01:50.000
Uhh! oh!

01:51.701 --> 01:53.901

02:07.434 --> 02:09.267
He's not in yet.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.667
What?

02:15.734 --> 02:18.767
You've been walking
past hotch's office
for an hour.

02:18.834 --> 02:22.267
Emily's picking him up.

02:23.868 --> 02:25.968
Hotch told me
he was cleared to drive.

02:26.067 --> 02:27.067
He is.

02:27.133 --> 02:29.200
She wants to do it.

02:31.467 --> 02:33.734
What's going on?

02:39.801 --> 02:41.534
He's only had a month off,
rossi.

02:41.601 --> 02:43.601
Technically, 34 days.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.267
And you think
that's long enough?

02:45.334 --> 02:47.734
You don't? tell him.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.701
No, thanks.
i like my job.

02:50.767 --> 02:53.734
You like him more.

02:56.334 --> 02:58.501
What if he's got ptsd?

02:58.567 --> 03:00.534
He was evaluated.

03:00.601 --> 03:01.968
Come on, rossi,
we wrote those questions.

03:02.033 --> 03:04.100
Hotch knows exactly
how to answer them.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.300
So what are you gonna do,

03:05.367 --> 03:06.634
Pick apart
everything he does?

03:06.701 --> 03:09.367
How long should he be gone?
a year? 2?

03:09.434 --> 03:11.300
Every day that foyet
is out there, hotch loses,

03:11.367 --> 03:13.100
And you know that.

03:13.167 --> 03:14.801
You know what
that makes hotch?

03:14.868 --> 03:15.934
Distracted.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.734
Motivated.

03:26.033 --> 03:28.067
Derek.

03:32.701 --> 03:35.234
He's coming back
because he has to.

03:35.300 --> 03:38.734
He needs to know
we've got his back.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.067
He knows that.

03:40.133 --> 03:43.701
Then we don't let him
forget it.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.601
Reid: thanks.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.100
Does it hurt?

03:56.167 --> 03:58.000
It really only hurts
when i think about it,

03:58.067 --> 03:59.868
Which is pretty much
all the time.

04:01.334 --> 04:02.734
No, no, no.

04:02.801 --> 04:04.133
What?
get away, you.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.367
These are for hotch.

04:05.434 --> 04:07.033
I get shot in the leg
and i don't get any cookies.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.567
You know he's gonna hate
the attention.

04:08.634 --> 04:10.434
It's cookies, not cake.

04:10.501 --> 04:13.067
He's probably gonna pretend
like nothing happened, anyway.

04:13.133 --> 04:14.634
Well, it doesn't mean
we have to.

04:14.701 --> 04:16.033
I think maybe we should.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.233
I don't roll that way.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.534
I've been thinking about it?

04:18.601 --> 04:19.834
The entire time
i've known hotch,

04:19.901 --> 04:21.601
I don't think i've ever
seen him blink.

04:21.666 --> 04:22.534
I know.

04:22.601 --> 04:23.601
It's weird.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.133
Classic alpha male behavior.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.400
Do you think
he stared down foyet?

04:27.467 --> 04:30.601
Maybe. if it would
save his life.

04:30.667 --> 04:33.300
Do you think he stared
the whole time,
like with each stab?

04:33.367 --> 04:35.934
I have no idea.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.367
Is he ok?

04:37.434 --> 04:39.601
I wouldn't be, but...

04:39.667 --> 04:41.634
I'm a blinker.

04:41.701 --> 04:43.200
Spence, there you are.

04:43.267 --> 04:44.667
Grab your go bag.
what's going on?

04:44.734 --> 04:45.667
Turn on the news.

04:45.734 --> 04:47.067
Which one?

04:47.133 --> 04:48.367
It doesn't matter.

04:48.434 --> 04:50.167
Just after 8:00
this morning,

04:50.234 --> 04:51.667
40-year-old darrin call,

04:51.734 --> 04:53.467
A lifelong resident
of louisville,

04:53.534 --> 04:55.467
Assaulted customers
at the pharmacy

04:55.534 --> 04:58.100
On the corner of main
and truxton avenues.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.334
Eyewitnesses saw him
walking east on main street

05:00.400 --> 05:01.734
Minutes after the attack.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.334
He has not been seen
since then.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.133
We're going to louisville.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.434
He was wearing
a blue shirt, jeans,

05:06.501 --> 05:07.767
And a light-gray jacket.

05:07.834 --> 05:10.100
Within the hour, the governor
has called in all sources

05:10.167 --> 05:11.300
For a manhunt.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.133
Despite these statewide efforts,

05:13.200 --> 05:16.033
The suspect has eluded
law enforcement.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.300
The body count is rising.
3 are confirmed dead--

05:18.367 --> 05:19.300
[knock on door]

05:19.367 --> 05:20.334
Including
an armed bank guard

05:20.400 --> 05:22.634
Whose gun was used
in the attack.

05:22.701 --> 05:24.434
Another 2 remain
in critical condition.

05:24.501 --> 05:26.634
The assailant
is still out there.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.834
We are going back
to eric jennings

05:27.901 --> 05:30.400
Who's been talking
to residents of louisville--

05:30.467 --> 05:32.033
[turns off tv]

05:39.467 --> 05:41.133
Hey.
hey.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.901
What do we know about
this case in kentucky?

05:42.968 --> 05:45.801
Uh, there's no connection
between call and his victims.

05:45.868 --> 05:47.834
Louisville p.d.'s
covered the city,

05:47.901 --> 05:49.334
But there hasn't been
any sign of him

05:49.400 --> 05:50.834
Since he left the pharmacy.

05:50.901 --> 05:52.167
You check his house, family?

05:52.234 --> 05:54.901
Locals are on it.

05:54.968 --> 05:56.767
Start with
his most recent history.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.767
Find the stressor.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.400
Uh, don't move.

06:02.467 --> 06:04.000
[setting alarm]

06:04.067 --> 06:05.334
Ready?

06:05.400 --> 06:07.300
Are you?

06:19.334 --> 06:21.434
So our point person
in louisville

06:21.501 --> 06:23.634
Is lieutenant
kevin mitchell.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.767
Good morning.

06:25.834 --> 06:26.767
Good to see you.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.267
You, too.

06:28.334 --> 06:29.434
You look well, sir.
thank you.

06:29.501 --> 06:30.467
How long
do you have that?

06:30.534 --> 06:33.434
I'm not really sure.
welcome back.

06:33.501 --> 06:35.300
Thank you.

06:35.367 --> 06:36.767
Any other attacks?

06:36.834 --> 06:38.868
Um, no, not yet.

06:38.934 --> 06:40.133
Call's proven
hard to track.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.601
He's never had
a driver's license,

06:41.667 --> 06:43.200
So he's most likely
still on foot.

06:43.267 --> 06:44.200
Jj: or public
transportation.

06:44.267 --> 06:45.701
He's not gonna take the bus.

06:45.767 --> 06:46.801
His face is everywhere.

06:46.868 --> 06:48.067
Hotch: has anyone
found a stressor?

06:48.133 --> 06:49.567
He just lost his job.

06:49.634 --> 06:51.133
He's worked at a factory
since 1990.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.267
Made appliances
since forever and not
a single promotion.

06:53.334 --> 06:55.501
That's a long time
to be bitter.

06:55.567 --> 06:56.767
Reid: or he doesn't care.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.434
Not if he's got
a family to feed.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.734
Garcia: actually,
he's of the hermit variety.

06:59.801 --> 07:01.133
As far as i can tell,
he's got no one.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.100
No wife, no kids,
no parents.

07:03.167 --> 07:04.667
Nothing to live for.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.133
So why hasn't
he killed himself yet?

07:06.200 --> 07:08.634
Sprees usually end
in suicide.

07:08.701 --> 07:10.267
If he's got nothing
to live for,
why hasn't he ended it?

07:10.334 --> 07:11.434
'cause he isn't finished yet.

07:11.501 --> 07:12.767
We know he has displaced anger.

07:12.834 --> 07:14.601
He took it out
on the first victim.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.067
Well, the stock boy
represents someone.
we need to know who.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.167
Is he military?

07:18.234 --> 07:19.300
Negative.

07:19.367 --> 07:21.000
Well, he's lashing out
for a reason.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.467
This guy's got anger,
endless targets, and a gun,

07:23.534 --> 07:24.968
And he's just getting started.

Hotch: emily dickinson wrote,

"one need not be a house.

08:11.467 --> 08:15.367
The brain has corridors
surpassing material place."

08:15.934 --> 08:17.734
All right.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.633
We've got checkpoints
at the state line

08:20.700 --> 08:23.800
On both i-64 and i-65

08:23.867 --> 08:25.633
And within a 20-mile
radius of downtown.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.401
We think he's still on foot.

08:27.968 --> 08:30.034
It's been just under
3 hours with an average
walking speed

08:30.101 --> 08:32.433
Of 2.5 miles per hour,
which rounds up

08:32.500 --> 08:34.767
To an approximate
8-mile radius.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.667
Now, we've concentrated here.

08:36.734 --> 08:39.833
First responders
started a hard-target search

08:39.900 --> 08:43.433
Of businesses and residences
within that 8 miles.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.368
You're gonna join 'em.
you know what he looks like.

08:46.434 --> 08:48.368
Go find him.

08:48.434 --> 08:51.301
We dug up all we could
on darrin call.

08:51.368 --> 08:54.034
Even went to his apartment.
didn't find much.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.734
We've got agents
over there now.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.001
Don't worry,
we'll fill it in.

08:57.067 --> 08:58.533
What's your strategy?

08:58.600 --> 09:00.434
We try to figure out
where he's headed next.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.934
Huh. you got a crystal ball?

09:02.001 --> 09:04.167
Most spree killers are
outwardly aggressive.

09:04.234 --> 09:06.700
We've studied
call's behavior,
and he's defensive.

09:06.767 --> 09:10.500
Jj: first victim--stock boy.

09:13.533 --> 09:16.834
Boy, there's nothing
defensive about that.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.001
Actually, there is.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.967
Call doesn't react
until he's touched.

09:20.034 --> 09:21.667
And that's what set him off?

09:21.734 --> 09:22.800
Happens every time.

09:22.867 --> 09:26.834
Contact, then stab,

09:26.900 --> 09:28.101
Contact, stab.

09:28.167 --> 09:31.567
So you're saying he didn't
mean to hurt these people.

09:31.633 --> 09:33.234
He didn't go in there
with a weapon.

09:33.301 --> 09:34.567
Well, now he's got 2.

09:34.633 --> 09:37.301
I just put his face
all over the news.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.434
People are gonna stop him
themselves.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.767
How soon can we have
a press conference?

09:40.834 --> 09:42.600
The camera crews
are out front.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.700
Great. let me call hotch.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.167
Who's that?

09:46.234 --> 09:49.001
Our supervisor. he's at
the crime scene already.

09:49.067 --> 09:51.934
What is it about this kid?

09:52.001 --> 09:53.734
Reid: that's what
we need to figure out.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.934
Call's apartment
is 5 minutes from the pharmacy,

09:56.001 --> 09:57.401
But there's no sign

09:57.468 --> 09:58.667
That he came here
to wash off that blood.

09:58.734 --> 10:00.533
How's he still
on the street,
looking like that?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.334
Maybe he's not.

10:02.401 --> 10:04.834
Garcia said he's got nobody.
where would he go?

10:04.900 --> 10:07.934
Call gets up, he makes his bed.

10:08.001 --> 10:09.934
We're sure
he wasn't military?

10:10.001 --> 10:11.767
It looks like one neat aspect.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.533
Maybe he was hospitalized.
i'll call garcia.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.533
Then he's probably
got the same routine
every day.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.867
Except today.

10:17.934 --> 10:19.967
He finished his cereal,
walked to the pharmacy,

10:20.034 --> 10:21.900
And killed 3 people.

10:22.934 --> 10:24.434
Why?

10:27.067 --> 10:30.267
Mr. call was always so quiet.

10:30.334 --> 10:32.468
He's been coming here for years.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.201
Morgan: had he ever had
a run-in with the stock boy?

10:34.267 --> 10:35.767
John was new here.
i waved him over.

10:35.834 --> 10:38.301
I didn't know what else to do.
no one else was helping.

10:38.368 --> 10:40.633
He didn't turn violent
until you gave him
his prescription?

10:40.700 --> 10:42.167
Well, it wasn't his.

10:42.234 --> 10:43.967
You handed him a bag.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.234
It was somebody else's.

10:45.301 --> 10:46.500
I just wanted him
to calm down.

10:46.567 --> 10:48.767
Jj's press conference
is in 5 minutes.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.334
Hotch, we might have
something else here.

10:50.401 --> 10:51.767
Why didn't you give him
his own medication?

10:51.834 --> 10:53.301
Well, he didn't have
any refills left.

10:53.368 --> 10:54.368
For what?

10:54.434 --> 10:55.500
Uh, alprazolam.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.834
But, uh, he used to be on
thiothixene.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.101
He was on
an antipsychotic?

11:01.167 --> 11:03.334
Well, that's why i wanted him
to calm down.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.301
You said he used to be.
how long has he been
off of them?

11:05.368 --> 11:06.700
At least a month.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.734
And when were you
gonna tell us this?

11:08.800 --> 11:11.034
He's armed,
he's delusional.
who's his doctor?

11:11.101 --> 11:12.434
Uh...

11:12.500 --> 11:14.967
I don't remember.
my computer.

11:15.034 --> 11:15.900
Hotch: great.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.734
I'm sorry.
great.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.001
Excuse us.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.234
Hotch.

11:21.301 --> 11:22.967
Call jj and tell her
about the meds.

11:23.034 --> 11:24.267
This is not her fault.

11:24.334 --> 11:26.567
Morgan, he's in a psychotic
break. it changes everything.

11:26.633 --> 11:28.334
You want to talk
about this?

11:28.401 --> 11:29.867
No! i want to find him.
garcia,

11:29.934 --> 11:32.001
He's been off his
antipsychotic for a month.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.301
What else did you miss?

11:33.368 --> 11:35.600
I'm sorry, sir. i didn't get
his medical records yet, so--

11:35.667 --> 11:36.700
Well, find them.
find everything.

11:36.767 --> 11:37.700
Yes...

11:37.767 --> 11:39.401
Sir.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.167
[groaning]

12:00.800 --> 12:02.533
[rattling doorknob]

12:03.734 --> 12:04.767
Excuse me.

12:04.834 --> 12:05.700
[pounding on door]

12:05.767 --> 12:07.067
I'm in a session!

12:08.401 --> 12:09.867
I need the pills.

12:09.934 --> 12:11.800
Darrin, what's wrong?

12:11.867 --> 12:12.900
What happened?

12:12.967 --> 12:15.134
He had a--a knife.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.633
Who?

12:16.700 --> 12:19.434
It's just like
in the nightmares. he--

12:19.500 --> 12:21.001
[groaning]

12:22.434 --> 12:24.500
He's doing it again.

12:24.567 --> 12:26.767
He can't hurt you.

12:26.834 --> 12:28.301
We talked about this.

12:28.368 --> 12:29.334
You want to remember.

12:29.401 --> 12:32.101
It's why you're off the pills.

12:32.167 --> 12:33.301
You said i would get better.

12:33.368 --> 12:34.633
You are.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.867
Does it look like
i'm better?!

12:36.934 --> 12:38.334
Darrin. darrin.

12:38.401 --> 12:41.567
I gotta...make it stop.

12:44.267 --> 12:45.500
Make it stop!

12:45.567 --> 12:47.134
Just make it--make it...
darrin...

12:47.201 --> 12:48.800
Calm down. that's it.
just look here.

12:48.867 --> 12:49.867
Make it--make it--

12:49.934 --> 12:51.101
Just breathe.

12:51.167 --> 12:52.934
Take a breath.

12:53.001 --> 12:54.700
Prentiss: he was unarmed.
he didn't mean to hurt anyone.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.368
All he wanted
was his medication,

12:56.434 --> 12:57.633
But he didn't get it.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.434
He needs help.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.434
Who's call's doctor?

13:01.533 --> 13:03.867
State appointed psychiatrist
charles cipolla.

13:03.934 --> 13:04.800
Hotch and morgan
are on their way.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.967
Where's his office?

13:06.034 --> 13:08.533
Camden and third.
cipolla's not picking up.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.201
Gps says were 5 minutes away.

13:10.267 --> 13:13.134
Ok, rossi, we're 5 out.
tell mitchell
to meet us there.

13:13.201 --> 13:15.700
[grunts]
[telephone rings]

13:15.767 --> 13:17.667
Darrin?
uhh! uhh!

13:17.734 --> 13:18.667
Darrin?
[ring]

13:18.734 --> 13:20.867
Uhh! no!

13:21.767 --> 13:23.201
No! get it out!
darrin.

13:23.267 --> 13:24.867
No!

13:24.934 --> 13:26.267
Darrin!
get it out!

13:26.334 --> 13:27.567
No, get it out!

13:28.368 --> 13:30.301
Can't get it--

13:30.368 --> 13:31.334
I can't get it out!

13:31.401 --> 13:32.401
I can't--gotta--

13:32.468 --> 13:34.234
I gotta get it out!
darrin--

13:34.301 --> 13:35.700
Darrin, darrin, here. here.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.834
Darrin! darrin, here.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.934
Take my shirt.
just take it.

13:40.001 --> 13:43.034
There you go,
that's good.

13:43.101 --> 13:44.434
No! don't touch him!

13:47.167 --> 13:49.500
No! oh, my god!

13:49.567 --> 13:51.967
No! darrin, no! oh, my god!

13:52.034 --> 13:54.667
[siren]

14:01.867 --> 14:05.101
[tires screeching]

14:18.834 --> 14:21.468
All right, get out of here
and check the perimeter.
do it now.

14:32.301 --> 14:34.201
We're too late.

14:36.468 --> 14:38.834
Hotch!

14:57.834 --> 15:00.001
He cleaned up,
changed his clothes,

15:00.067 --> 15:02.433
Could have dyed his hair
for all i know.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.600
Call's suffering from
a psychotic break.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.467
He's not dodging us
on purpose.

15:06.534 --> 15:07.834
Oh, come on.

15:07.901 --> 15:08.934
Trust me.

15:09.001 --> 15:10.500
If he was psychotic,

15:10.567 --> 15:13.001
Why would his doctor
take him off the drugs?

15:13.067 --> 15:15.067
Call has no history
of violent behavior.

15:15.134 --> 15:18.101
Cipolla couldn't predict
that would happen.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.234
Look at this place.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.034
Yeah, it's a mess.
no, it's more than that.

15:21.101 --> 15:22.367
Call was looking for something.

15:22.433 --> 15:23.400
Yeah, the drugs.

15:23.467 --> 15:25.934
Doctor doesn't keep
the drugs here.

15:26.001 --> 15:27.834
Scrip pad is still
on his desk.

15:27.901 --> 15:29.268
My guess is he came here
for help.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.667
His file's missing.

15:30.734 --> 15:33.734
[cell phone rings]

15:35.667 --> 15:37.234
Yeah, baby girl,
what's going on?

15:37.300 --> 15:38.734
Where's hotch?
he's not answering.

15:38.801 --> 15:40.367
He's outside.
he's all right.

15:40.433 --> 15:41.467
Are you sure?

15:41.534 --> 15:43.201
Yeah. what's up?

15:43.268 --> 15:44.201
A mystery.

15:44.268 --> 15:45.600
Come on,
not today, garcia.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.034
I know. here's the deal.

15:47.101 --> 15:49.333
When i missed
the antipsychotics--

15:49.400 --> 15:51.034
Listen to me.
that was not your fault.

15:51.101 --> 15:53.134
You are ever my champion, sugar,

15:53.201 --> 15:54.834
But i believe it was.

15:54.901 --> 15:56.801
Anyway, when i did that,
i went back to the beginning

15:56.867 --> 15:59.333
For call, except there is
no beginning.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.467
Wait a minute.

16:00.534 --> 16:01.634
Rossi.

16:01.700 --> 16:02.634
Say that again.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.034
What are you
talking about?

16:04.101 --> 16:07.534
Darrin call didn't exist
like from 1969 to 1975.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.567
There's no birth certificate,
no social security,

16:09.634 --> 16:12.067
No identity, nothing,
until he was 6 years old.

16:12.134 --> 16:13.333
Was he abandoned?

16:13.400 --> 16:16.333
My least 3 favorite words
strung together--

16:16.400 --> 16:17.834
I don't know.

16:17.901 --> 16:19.801
My guess is
neither does he.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.201
I should have seen
the blinking on the video.

16:30.268 --> 16:31.634
Well, it could have been
a nervous tic.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.168
But it wasn't.
it's a classic sign

16:33.234 --> 16:35.234
Of long-term antipsychotic use,
and i missed it.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.034
We all did.

16:37.101 --> 16:38.834
Well, regardless,
those men died.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.034
Garcia's got something.

16:42.101 --> 16:45.534
May 1, 1975,
a 6-year-old darrin call

16:45.600 --> 16:47.967
Was found roaming
in the middle of nowhere
and was picked up

16:48.034 --> 16:50.634
And was in state care
for the first few months.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.067
Did he tell the cops
what happened?

16:52.134 --> 16:53.967
No. because he didn't talk,

16:54.034 --> 16:55.467
Not for over a year.
and once he started talking,

16:55.534 --> 16:57.168
He only knew his life
as darrin call.

16:57.234 --> 16:59.234
That's awful.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.967
So is this. little darrin
was never claimed.

17:01.034 --> 17:02.467
Jj: maybe he wasn't
from the area.

17:02.534 --> 17:06.134
There wasn't a thriving
missing children's network
in 1975.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.767
Call is wearing
cipolla's clothing.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.067
You think he's lucid?

17:16.134 --> 17:17.834
No, mostly likely
he's just freaked out.

17:17.901 --> 17:19.666
Either way, we should
update the public.

17:19.733 --> 17:21.101
You should
be there, too.

17:21.167 --> 17:23.367
What is this?

17:23.433 --> 17:25.001
Call's timeline.
he left louisville?

17:25.067 --> 17:26.467
3 times.

17:26.534 --> 17:28.867
Always came back
to the same 10-block radius.

17:28.934 --> 17:31.001
Why?

17:31.067 --> 17:32.500
Victims are often drawn
to the scene of
their first trauma.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.001
Part of him
wanted to escape,

17:34.067 --> 17:35.967
The other part probably
struggled to find answers.

17:36.034 --> 17:37.500
Was he hospitalized?

17:37.567 --> 17:40.067
Uh, 1985 for 2 years.

17:40.134 --> 17:42.433
Garcia: yeah. and again
in '95 for a few months,

17:42.500 --> 17:44.001
Both at the state facility
in fayette county.

17:44.067 --> 17:45.367
You know he doesn't drive.

17:45.433 --> 17:47.901
You think he'd walk
all the way out there?

17:47.967 --> 17:50.268
He's desperate.
he'll find a way.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.001
Well, then i'll tell
the sheriff in fayette.

17:53.067 --> 17:54.467
When did he start
the prescriptions, garcia?

17:54.534 --> 17:56.400
In 1977, and it looks like
he tried them all.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.667
I've got a list.

17:57.734 --> 17:58.834
Alphabetically, alprazolam,

17:58.901 --> 18:00.268
Clonazepam, diazepam--

18:00.333 --> 18:02.201
Just send it.
yes, sir.

18:02.268 --> 18:03.901
His doctor weaned him off
the prescription for a reason.

18:03.967 --> 18:06.934
Now, that's a big risk,
so the reward
must have been greater.

18:07.001 --> 18:08.634
Prentiss:
he needs the truth.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.067
He took his file.

18:10.134 --> 18:11.168
He's got some answers.

18:11.234 --> 18:12.367
And a head start.

18:12.433 --> 18:14.834
Well, we need to catch up.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.634
[screaming]

18:36.700 --> 18:39.268
[indistinct chatter]

18:44.067 --> 18:45.534
Jj: records from child services

18:45.600 --> 18:48.001
Has him extremely
physically abused.

18:48.067 --> 18:49.268
No signs of sexual assault.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.667
Garcia: that's a miracle.

18:50.734 --> 18:52.901
Either way, the trauma
was debilitating.

18:52.967 --> 18:55.168
Was he running from
an abusive home
or an abduction?

18:55.234 --> 18:58.034
Wouldn't there be a paper trail
if it were a kidnapping?

18:58.101 --> 19:01.534
Garcia, look for unsolved
missing children's cases
from the 1970s.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.333
Now, there was a case

19:03.400 --> 19:05.934
In hollow creek.
kids were dead, though.

19:06.001 --> 19:06.967
Found them in pieces.

19:07.034 --> 19:08.801
When was this?
'75.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.634
Nobody talks about it
'cause they never
found the guy.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.934
You think call
walked away from that?

19:14.001 --> 19:15.567
It's possible.

19:15.634 --> 19:16.934
Garcia, send me everything.

19:17.001 --> 19:18.600
Done.

19:20.667 --> 19:21.867
Can you find the case file?

19:21.934 --> 19:23.400
I'll do what i can.

19:32.268 --> 19:35.168
[groaning]

19:41.201 --> 19:42.433
Boy: you're it!

19:42.500 --> 19:43.834
Second boy:
come on, wait up!

19:43.901 --> 19:46.134
[kids chattering]

19:49.034 --> 19:51.268
Is there a suspect list?

19:51.333 --> 19:52.801
It's in here somewhere.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.534
Reid: he was known as
the hollow creek killer.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.634
3 bodies were found,
some never identified.

19:57.700 --> 20:00.834
Oh, god, he used lime
to dispose--

20:00.901 --> 20:02.168
There's a survivor.
call?

20:02.234 --> 20:03.767
No, a 12-year-old boy
named tommy phillips.

20:03.834 --> 20:06.034
Parents said he'd been
missing for 2 weeks,

20:06.101 --> 20:07.534
Came back a different kid.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.500
Of course he did.

20:08.567 --> 20:09.734
Let's see. the family
left louisville

20:09.801 --> 20:11.767
After tommy told police
where to find the bodies.

20:11.834 --> 20:15.400
He also said the suspect
was a white man in his 30s

20:15.467 --> 20:17.467
And drove
a red pickup truck.

20:17.534 --> 20:18.934
We need to find tommy.

20:19.001 --> 20:20.268
He'd be 46 now.

20:20.333 --> 20:21.834
His parents probably
changed his name

20:21.901 --> 20:23.067
And got as far away
as possible.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.268
Garcia can find him.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.467
Don't get your hopes up.

20:25.534 --> 20:26.634
Garcia,
everything you can find

20:26.700 --> 20:27.634
On a tommy phillips.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.567
Reid: the victims had cuts.

20:28.634 --> 20:30.101
The stock boy's blade

20:30.168 --> 20:31.801
Is what set him off
in the pharmacy.

20:31.867 --> 20:33.101
If this is what call's
been running from,

20:33.168 --> 20:34.767
It's no wonder
he's blocked it out.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.400
Since he's clean now,
there's no medication

20:36.467 --> 20:38.567
To block his memories
and he wants answers.

20:38.634 --> 20:40.734
Where would he go?

20:43.901 --> 20:45.168
To what he knows.

20:45.234 --> 20:46.634
He doesn't know anything.

20:46.700 --> 20:47.734
That's the problem.

20:47.801 --> 20:50.967
He's beginning to.
1975, sterner orphanage.

20:51.034 --> 20:53.934
It's where he became
darrin call.

20:54.001 --> 20:56.367
[knocking on door]

20:56.433 --> 20:58.567
[knocking]

21:01.834 --> 21:03.367
Yes?

21:03.433 --> 21:06.367
There was a nice man
here, mr. cureton.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.734
I need to see him.

21:07.801 --> 21:09.500
I'm sorry,
he retired years ago.

21:09.567 --> 21:10.834
Well, where did he go?

21:10.901 --> 21:12.767
I don't know. i'm sorry--
you gotta know! he--

21:14.700 --> 21:16.034
He didn't just leave.

21:16.101 --> 21:20.034
I'm sorry, sir,
but i told you,
he's not here.

21:20.101 --> 21:21.234
Come on, kids, homework!

21:21.300 --> 21:22.634
Come on.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.700
Come on.

21:24.767 --> 21:28.500
Would you please leave?
the children are coming in.
please.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.801
Come on. come on.
straight to the books.

21:30.867 --> 21:34.134
Right to it.
straight to the back
and we'll sit down.

21:44.867 --> 21:47.168
He's here.

21:47.234 --> 21:49.534
He's here.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.600
Who?

21:50.667 --> 21:51.600
What are you
talking about?

21:51.667 --> 21:53.300
Nobody's here.
he's here.

21:53.367 --> 21:54.667
I just--

21:54.734 --> 21:56.801
Oh, careful, ryan.

21:57.967 --> 21:59.201
Come on, you can make it!

21:59.268 --> 22:01.067
Come on! come on, come on!

22:01.134 --> 22:03.101
Tommy, tommy,

22:03.168 --> 22:04.600
We gotta go.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.101
Stop it!
no, wait--

22:06.168 --> 22:07.634
Stop it! stop it!
aah!

22:07.700 --> 22:09.634
Stop it!
aah!

22:09.700 --> 22:10.934
Come on, tommy.

22:11.001 --> 22:13.767
Go, go!
somebody help!

22:13.834 --> 22:14.934
Somebody!

22:15.001 --> 22:16.600
Go, go!

22:19.433 --> 22:20.967
Thank you.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.367
He called the boy tommy.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.767
Is that
what set him off?

22:28.834 --> 22:30.867
She thought it was
his reflection.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.934
Whoever hurt him
years ago

22:33.001 --> 22:34.367
Might have been
the same age he is now.

22:34.433 --> 22:35.467
He might have seen
the similarity.

22:35.534 --> 22:36.934
What about the boy?

22:37.001 --> 22:38.067
His real name is ryan.

22:38.134 --> 22:39.534
She said he's quiet
and submissive.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.901
Is morgan
getting anything

22:40.967 --> 22:41.901
Out of the other witness?

22:41.967 --> 22:43.034
Not yet.

22:43.101 --> 22:46.534
A minivan was stolen
one block from here.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.300
Call's never driven
in his life.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.134
You think he's still
not running from us?

22:50.201 --> 22:52.034
Which way?

22:52.101 --> 22:53.534
Eastbound. i got roadblocks
set up everywhere.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.500
He's not getting out
of this county.

22:55.567 --> 22:57.801
You're wasting your time.

22:58.567 --> 22:59.734
He's outnumbered.

22:59.801 --> 23:01.801
You think he's gonna
just disappear?

23:01.867 --> 23:04.534
I think he took
the boy for a reason.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.934
I don't care why he took him.

23:07.001 --> 23:08.101
You should.

23:08.168 --> 23:10.300
Call's memory
is no longer suppressed.

23:10.367 --> 23:11.667
He's reinventing his past,

23:11.734 --> 23:13.134
And unless
we understand how,

23:13.201 --> 23:14.600
We're not gonna find
either of them.

23:14.667 --> 23:17.400
Well, i'm not gonna
just sit around and speculate.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.067
Then don't.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.834
You don't think
we should chase him either?

23:24.901 --> 23:26.901
We need to get ahead
of call.

23:34.367 --> 23:36.134
There's a kid missing.

23:36.201 --> 23:38.168
They don't need
the extra manpower.

23:38.234 --> 23:39.234
Since when?

23:39.300 --> 23:41.500
If we'd studied
foyet's initial crimes,

23:41.567 --> 23:45.101
We would have known
that a survivor
didn't make sense.

23:45.168 --> 23:46.734
What does he have
to do with this?

23:46.801 --> 23:50.333
All we had to do was stop
and look at foyet's history,

23:50.400 --> 23:53.234
And we didn't, and we lost
two couples and a bus
full of people.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.400
And i'm not making
that mistake again.

24:00.834 --> 24:02.600
Ryan: they're gonna find us.

24:02.667 --> 24:03.767
Where? you saw 'em?
where?

24:03.834 --> 24:04.700
Who?

24:04.767 --> 24:05.901
Where did you seem 'em?

24:05.967 --> 24:08.034
Who?
where did you see 'em?! where?!

24:08.101 --> 24:10.268
Please, just let me go.

24:10.333 --> 24:12.333
I'm sorry, tommy.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.433
Just--

24:13.500 --> 24:15.600
We just gotta--
we gotta--

24:15.667 --> 24:17.333
Just--ohh--we gotta--

24:17.400 --> 24:18.834
We gotta hurry, tommy,

24:18.901 --> 24:21.268
'cause he's gonna get us
and we just--

24:21.333 --> 24:24.801
We just gotta--uhh--
[groans]

24:24.867 --> 24:26.001
So what do we know?

24:26.067 --> 24:28.268
There were only 4 suspects
in the hollow creek case

24:28.333 --> 24:29.467
And they're all dead.

24:29.534 --> 24:32.667
The kids were taken
in 1973, '74, and '75.

24:32.734 --> 24:34.433
And all on the way
home from school.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.667
Different school districts.

24:35.734 --> 24:37.067
He waited for them
to be alone.

24:37.134 --> 24:38.168
That takes patience.

24:38.234 --> 24:40.001
He must have had time off
in the afternoons.

24:40.067 --> 24:41.300
He lived or worked
near the schools.

24:41.367 --> 24:43.634
That's a lot of doors
to knock on.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.034
You think call's
going back there?

24:45.101 --> 24:46.134
I think there's
a good chance.

24:46.201 --> 24:47.467
I'll tell mitchell.

24:47.534 --> 24:49.400
Where's the secondary
location?

24:49.467 --> 24:51.467
He needed seclusion
to do what he did.

24:51.534 --> 24:52.567
[beep]

24:52.634 --> 24:54.300
Go ahead, garcia.
you're on speaker.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.967
I found tommy. he goes by
james thomas anderson now.

24:57.034 --> 24:58.700
Is he local?

24:58.767 --> 25:00.534
One county over. address
and bio are coming...now.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.367
Hotch: thanks, garcia.

25:02.433 --> 25:04.967
What does darrin call
have to do with me?

25:05.034 --> 25:08.700
We think he survived
the hollow creek murders.

25:08.767 --> 25:10.734
Nobody survived that.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.067
You did.

25:13.134 --> 25:15.700
There was another boy.

25:15.767 --> 25:17.034
He was 6.

25:17.101 --> 25:18.400
No, that's not true.

25:18.467 --> 25:19.467
We don't have time for this.

25:19.534 --> 25:22.967
I'm telling you,
i was alone.

25:23.034 --> 25:25.901
Just like now?

25:25.967 --> 25:27.333
Excuse me?

25:27.400 --> 25:29.134
Have you ever been married?

25:29.201 --> 25:31.667
Any relationships?
any family?

25:31.734 --> 25:33.400
What does that have
to do with anything?

25:33.467 --> 25:36.333
Or are you afraid
you'll abandon them, too?

25:36.400 --> 25:38.400
Or was it because of
your alcoholism?

25:38.467 --> 25:40.567
I would never leave a kid.

25:40.634 --> 25:43.168
Did he cry too much?

25:43.234 --> 25:44.967
Was he too slow?
what was it?

25:45.034 --> 25:47.367
How could you leave
a 6-year-old all alone?

25:55.967 --> 25:58.500
I was only 12 years old.

25:59.834 --> 26:02.801
He's been taking medications
to deal with the trauma

26:02.867 --> 26:04.634
That suppressed
his memories.

26:04.700 --> 26:08.901
That kind of amnesia
is a psychological defense.

26:08.967 --> 26:12.067
He's gonna wish
he never remembered.

26:12.134 --> 26:14.268
We know what you told
the police.

26:14.333 --> 26:17.034
We need to know
about the boy.

26:19.367 --> 26:21.634
He never talked.

26:24.201 --> 26:26.734
Hey! hey, kid.

26:26.801 --> 26:29.600
Hey, kid.

26:29.667 --> 26:33.001
Is the old man
passed out yet?

26:37.734 --> 26:40.001
Can you reach those?

26:44.400 --> 26:46.534
Good. good. good.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.168
Good.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.168
Ok. bring 'em. please.

26:51.234 --> 26:52.667
Bring 'em here.

26:52.734 --> 26:55.300
Go ahead, you can do it.

26:55.367 --> 26:57.634
Right there. good.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.333
Ok.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.400
Ok.

27:03.734 --> 27:05.967
Come on. come on!

27:10.400 --> 27:12.001
Come here.

27:12.067 --> 27:13.967
Grab the shovel.

27:26.901 --> 27:29.333
Hey, come here!

27:29.400 --> 27:30.333
[groaning]

27:30.400 --> 27:32.433
Quit struggling!

27:33.867 --> 27:36.333
Come here.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.500
Get out of there.

27:38.567 --> 27:39.534
Go on!

27:39.600 --> 27:41.333
Uhh!

27:42.967 --> 27:44.734
Ah!

27:47.134 --> 27:48.634
Come on.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.300
Come on!

27:53.867 --> 27:56.367
Come on, you can make it!

27:56.433 --> 27:59.168
[grunting]

28:00.433 --> 28:02.367
Come on, you can make it!

28:02.433 --> 28:03.367
Come on!

28:03.433 --> 28:04.634
Come on!

28:05.801 --> 28:07.934
Aah! go, tommy! run!

28:08.001 --> 28:10.201
Go, tommy! run!

28:10.268 --> 28:12.234
Go, tommy! run!

28:12.300 --> 28:14.967
I'd never heard
his voice before.

28:15.034 --> 28:17.834
He told you to go.

28:20.168 --> 28:22.168
He was a kid.

28:23.367 --> 28:25.168
So were you.

28:25.234 --> 28:28.168
Call wasn't in
the back with you.

28:30.567 --> 28:34.101
No, he was in the cab.

28:34.168 --> 28:35.600
He gave you water.

28:35.667 --> 28:37.168
Got the keys.

28:37.234 --> 28:39.834
Why wasn't he locked up?

28:39.901 --> 28:43.001
Maybe call
wasn't a victim.

28:45.001 --> 28:47.600
Call's reflection.

28:47.667 --> 28:49.967
Oh, god.

28:50.034 --> 28:53.300
His father was
the hollow creek killer.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.934
His own kid?

28:57.001 --> 28:59.300
No wonder
he was never claimed.

28:59.367 --> 29:01.500
How did the father explain
his son just disappeared?

29:01.567 --> 29:02.767
Could have said
he ran away.

29:02.834 --> 29:04.801
The mother would have
reported him missing.

29:04.867 --> 29:06.367
Maybe he said
the boy died.

29:06.433 --> 29:07.700
She'd want a funeral.

29:07.767 --> 29:08.934
What if there wasn't one?

29:09.001 --> 29:10.867
Morgan, call garcia.
ask her to check death records

29:10.934 --> 29:12.500
From 1969 to 1975.

29:12.567 --> 29:13.500
For who?

29:13.567 --> 29:14.801
For the mother.

29:14.867 --> 29:16.201
[breathing hard]

29:16.268 --> 29:17.201
[grunting]

29:17.268 --> 29:19.201
[grunting]

29:20.901 --> 29:23.134
[panting]

29:23.201 --> 29:25.333
Go, tommy! run!

29:25.400 --> 29:27.934
Go, tommy, run!

29:28.001 --> 29:29.667
You think you can get away?!

29:29.734 --> 29:30.700
Is that what you think?!

29:30.767 --> 29:32.134
You stupid little bastard.

29:32.201 --> 29:34.101
Uhh!

29:35.867 --> 29:38.001
[screaming]

29:38.067 --> 29:40.001
[horn honking]

29:40.067 --> 29:41.667
[honking]

29:43.333 --> 29:44.967
Hey!

29:45.034 --> 29:48.367
[grunting]

29:48.433 --> 29:49.867
Morgan: have you
narrowed it down?

29:49.934 --> 29:51.467
Oh, 6 years is a long time.
i need more parameters.

29:51.534 --> 29:54.034
She lived within
that 8-mile radius.

29:54.101 --> 29:56.001
She was married.
she was most likely
in her twenties.

29:56.067 --> 29:57.500
He was probably
her only kid.

29:57.567 --> 29:59.300
The husband drove
a red truck.

29:59.367 --> 30:00.934
Ok. this could be one.

30:01.001 --> 30:04.001
Here we go, doris jarvis.
died in childbirth.

30:04.067 --> 30:06.534
And let me guess--
she had a boy.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.967
Yeah.

30:08.034 --> 30:09.834
Baby girl, i'm gonna
put you on speaker.

30:09.901 --> 30:10.901
Guys.

30:10.967 --> 30:12.201
Garcia: ok, so doris jarvis

30:12.268 --> 30:13.700
Was married to bill jarvis.

30:13.767 --> 30:15.867
He owned a machine shop
just outside the city.

30:15.934 --> 30:17.667
That could be
the secondary location.

30:17.734 --> 30:19.634
It closed in 1980.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.867
He hasn't done anything since.
i guess he laid low.

30:21.934 --> 30:25.101
He had a red pickup until 1976
when he bought a black one.

30:25.168 --> 30:26.867
I know that because
that's what he was driving

30:26.934 --> 30:28.034
When he was arrested for duis.

30:28.101 --> 30:29.967
He was locked up
from '77 to '80,

30:30.034 --> 30:32.168
And i'm sending
his picture now.

30:33.901 --> 30:36.801
And that could certainly
be darrin call's father.

30:36.867 --> 30:38.201
Where's jarvis now?

30:38.268 --> 30:40.767
In the same house.
1457 hitchens avenue.

30:40.834 --> 30:42.400
Let's go.

30:59.667 --> 31:01.834
[gate creaks]

31:07.767 --> 31:09.700
[crowd cheering on tv]

31:09.767 --> 31:12.901
...that's gonna do it.

31:12.967 --> 31:15.034
There's no energy
shortage here.

31:15.101 --> 31:18.300
His third shot
of the 1975 season.

31:18.367 --> 31:19.967
We'd like to remind you--

31:20.034 --> 31:22.667
You're late.
of the game of the day.

31:25.067 --> 31:27.034
[indistinct tv announcer]

31:27.101 --> 31:29.134
Patterson still walking
around the mound.

31:29.201 --> 31:32.967
We're not quite sure
what is happening.

31:33.034 --> 31:35.067
[announcer continues]

31:35.134 --> 31:37.367
[crowd cheering on tv]

31:37.433 --> 31:40.367
He's behind
the count now,

31:40.433 --> 31:42.201
Three balls, one strike,

31:42.268 --> 31:43.400
With a man on first
and second

31:43.467 --> 31:44.534
Here in the bottom
of the eighth.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.634
I knew you'd come home.

32:06.567 --> 32:07.534
Lieutenant.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.500
The kid's in there.
we've got this.

32:09.567 --> 32:11.500
Tactical teams
are covering the exits.

32:11.567 --> 32:13.367
Call needs a distraction.

32:13.433 --> 32:14.634
He's focused on the old man.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.400
For now. but we're gonna
have to figure out

32:16.467 --> 32:17.767
The safest way
to get that kid out.

32:17.834 --> 32:19.901
I've got a team in the back
and one on the way.

32:19.967 --> 32:21.534
We're going to infiltrate.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.034
You do that
and someone else dies.

32:23.101 --> 32:25.400
Either call
or a child murderer--

32:25.467 --> 32:26.433
Flip a coin.

32:26.500 --> 32:27.867
It doesn't have to end
like that.

32:27.934 --> 32:29.534
We get a confession
out of jarvis
and he goes away,

32:29.600 --> 32:30.867
And call gets
his answers.

32:30.934 --> 32:32.534
No one else has to die.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.567
Hotch.

32:33.634 --> 32:36.634
Hotch.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.034
Hotch!

32:38.101 --> 32:39.168
What the hell is he doing?!

32:39.234 --> 32:40.234
Let him go.

32:40.300 --> 32:41.834
Rossi, i'm not letting him
go in there solo.

32:41.901 --> 32:44.101
We have to trust him.

32:48.201 --> 32:51.001
We can do this together.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.767
[door opens]

32:57.067 --> 32:58.001
[door closes]

32:58.067 --> 32:59.367
Get out!

32:59.433 --> 33:00.667
My name's aaron.

33:00.734 --> 33:02.734
This is between us and him.

33:02.801 --> 33:05.168
I know.

33:05.234 --> 33:06.700
Then you leave us alone.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.734
I know what he did
to those boys.

33:09.801 --> 33:12.500
I know about hollow creek
and the cage.

33:12.567 --> 33:14.500
And tommy.

33:14.567 --> 33:17.168
You know about tommy?

33:23.101 --> 33:25.034
Come on, you can make it!

33:25.101 --> 33:26.433
Come on!
come on!

33:26.500 --> 33:31.101
We're gonna get him back
for everything
that he done, tommy.

33:31.168 --> 33:32.901
Every single thing.

33:32.967 --> 33:35.867
Let him go. tommy
doesn't need to see this.

33:35.934 --> 33:37.268
He should die.

33:37.333 --> 33:40.400
He should.
but if you kill him,

33:40.467 --> 33:44.101
You have nothing,
and i thought
you wanted some answers.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.534
What's he doing?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.400
Stalling.

33:49.467 --> 33:51.600
He's got nothing to lose.

33:51.667 --> 33:53.467
Go ahead, darrin,
ask him.

33:53.534 --> 33:55.268
[whimpers]

33:55.333 --> 33:57.934
Why did you do that
to those kids?

33:58.001 --> 33:58.934
What kids?

33:59.001 --> 34:00.101
No!

34:00.168 --> 34:03.567
The ones that
we buried. why?!

34:04.500 --> 34:05.967
You're confused.

34:06.034 --> 34:07.300
No! unh!

34:07.367 --> 34:10.067
Jarvis, why didn't you move?

34:10.134 --> 34:12.900
This is my home.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.934
You sure it's not the view?

34:15.001 --> 34:16.268
Darrin, come here.

34:16.333 --> 34:18.567
Come take a look at this.

34:25.734 --> 34:27.567
He sits on the porch every day
and watches those kids.

34:27.634 --> 34:29.600
He can't help himself.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.168
You got the shot?

34:33.867 --> 34:36.833
Man on police radio:
negative.

34:36.900 --> 34:37.934
Damn it.

34:38.001 --> 34:39.734
What's he doing?

34:42.234 --> 34:44.168
Man on police radio:
bringing the boy out.

34:47.667 --> 34:49.567
Let's get hotch out of there.

34:49.634 --> 34:51.600
That's his call.

34:53.268 --> 34:56.967
We--we drove around
in that truck.

34:57.034 --> 34:58.767
[panting]

34:58.834 --> 35:00.134
You made your own son

35:00.201 --> 35:02.367
Sit in front so the other
boys would feel safe?

35:02.433 --> 35:06.067
You--you kept them
in cages.

35:06.134 --> 35:08.600
I burnt their clothes.

35:08.667 --> 35:09.834
And when you finished,
you'd bury them

35:09.901 --> 35:12.467
And you made him help.

35:12.534 --> 35:13.433
And--

35:13.500 --> 35:16.300
Get up.
pretend you're a man.

35:16.367 --> 35:18.168
You like little boys,
don't you?

35:18.234 --> 35:19.600
But they can't be
too small,

35:19.667 --> 35:21.168
'cause that would be wrong.

35:21.234 --> 35:23.500
What was it about them?
they make you feel strong,

35:23.567 --> 35:25.500
Make you feel like a man?

35:25.567 --> 35:27.001
You shut up.

35:27.067 --> 35:29.967
Is that a yes?

35:33.234 --> 35:34.067
Darrin.
please--

35:34.134 --> 35:36.333
Please.
we're surrounded here.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.901
The police are gonna
storm in here any minute.

35:37.967 --> 35:40.168
They will not shoot you
if you are unarmed.

35:40.234 --> 35:41.734
You need to put
the gun down now.

35:41.801 --> 35:43.268
Don't--don't--

35:43.333 --> 35:46.067
Tell me what to do!

35:46.134 --> 35:49.333
Uhh! don't--uhh--

35:49.400 --> 35:50.734
[gunshots]

35:51.567 --> 35:53.834
Go, go!

36:03.067 --> 36:04.433
What happened?

36:05.433 --> 36:07.400
I couldn't stop him.

36:14.101 --> 36:15.867
Rossi: it's over.

36:15.934 --> 36:18.300
For now.

36:21.967 --> 36:24.134
[indistinct chatter]

36:26.867 --> 36:28.367
Thank you.

36:32.834 --> 36:35.734
There's someone
i think you should talk to.

36:53.534 --> 36:55.168
Hey.

36:57.834 --> 37:00.300
Tommy?

37:01.367 --> 37:03.834
I'm so sorry.

37:06.367 --> 37:08.567
What for?

37:08.634 --> 37:11.634
For running away.

37:11.700 --> 37:13.134
We both ran.

37:13.201 --> 37:14.834
Yeah, but i left you behind.

37:14.901 --> 37:17.400
He could have killed you.

37:17.467 --> 37:19.634
He didn't.

37:20.667 --> 37:23.433
'cause i wasn't afraid
of him anymore.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.767
You've changed
everything, tommy.

37:25.834 --> 37:29.433
You're the one
that i waited for.

37:29.500 --> 37:32.201
You're the one
that saved me.

37:48.168 --> 37:50.700
[engine starts]

38:04.901 --> 38:06.801
Hotch: "there is no witness
so dreadful,

38:06.867 --> 38:09.300
"no accuser so terrible,

38:09.367 --> 38:12.967
As the conscience that dwells
in the heart of every man."

38:13.034 --> 38:15.034
Polybius.

38:19.067 --> 38:20.134
[knocks]

38:20.201 --> 38:21.500
Hey.

38:21.567 --> 38:24.101
I know what you want
to talk about.

38:24.168 --> 38:28.168
2 months ago we wouldn't
be breaking down
hotch's decisions.

38:28.234 --> 38:30.500
There'd be no doubt.

38:30.567 --> 38:33.534
2 months ago he had everything
to live for, rossi.

38:33.600 --> 38:36.201
Now his family's
just been taken away.

38:36.268 --> 38:38.700
How is he supposed to think
about anything else?

38:38.767 --> 38:41.901
How long is he gonna
let foyet win? hmm?

38:41.967 --> 38:44.067
I mean, come on,
by the time we catch this guy,

38:44.134 --> 38:46.767
Hotch could be more scarred
on the inside than he is
the outside.

38:46.834 --> 38:47.901
Hotch took a risk.

38:47.967 --> 38:50.034
But we saved that boy.

38:50.101 --> 38:52.067
He put his life at risk
in there,

38:52.134 --> 38:54.867
In ways that we are never
supposed to, and you know it.

38:54.934 --> 38:58.667
I'm not about to stand by
and watch this man kill himself.

38:58.734 --> 39:01.867
And you won't.

39:01.934 --> 39:03.134
Rossi...

39:03.201 --> 39:04.567
If hotch is gone,

39:04.634 --> 39:08.268
Foyet's got no one else
to torture. hotch wins.

39:08.333 --> 39:12.467
But if hotch lives
but doesn't get to watch
his son grow up,

39:12.534 --> 39:14.767
Hotch loses.

39:19.367 --> 39:22.567
[alarm beeping]

39:22.634 --> 39:25.101
You didn't have to walk
me up here, you know.

39:25.168 --> 39:26.101
I know.

39:26.168 --> 39:28.767
[resets alarm]

39:28.834 --> 39:31.234
So you think call's
gonna be ok?

39:31.300 --> 39:32.934
I don't know.

39:33.001 --> 39:35.234
He got his answers.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.333
He killed the man
who haunted him.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.634
And what else is there?

39:39.700 --> 39:43.134
The years of torture.

39:44.834 --> 39:47.134
Think he'll get over that?

39:47.201 --> 39:48.767
How could he?

39:48.834 --> 39:51.867
But at least he doesn't
have to feel like
he's alone anymore.

39:51.934 --> 39:54.600
He doesn't have anyone.

39:55.901 --> 39:58.433
He has tommy.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.834
He's not alone.

40:06.268 --> 40:07.667
Get some sleep.

40:07.734 --> 40:09.867
You, too.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.367
[sighs]
