00:24.192 --> 00:27.195
ROBIN: Calling all Titans!

00:27.228 --> 00:30.398
Please assemble
in the living room...

00:30.431 --> 00:33.601
For an ice cream sundae bar!

00:33.634 --> 00:36.770
"

00:36.804 --> 00:39.207
He did scream the "ice cream."

00:39.240 --> 00:41.142
We all screamed "ice cream."

00:41.175 --> 00:44.178
ALL: Ice cream!

00:45.146 --> 00:46.714
Wait a second.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.816
I see no cream of ice.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.684
No you don't.
Because there is none.

00:50.718 --> 00:54.855
-This, is a meeting.
-But dude, that's the opposite
of ice cream.

00:57.125 --> 01:00.428
We fell for the ole
sundae-bar but really it's
a boring meeting switcheroo.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.164
I fooled you all into coming
so I could show you something

01:03.197 --> 01:04.698
I've been working
very hard on.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.735
-The Rules of Robin.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.170
ALL: Boo!

01:09.203 --> 01:11.472
-Ba-boo!
-I said, "Boo!"

01:11.505 --> 01:13.307
Boo, boo, boo.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.309
You don't even know
what you're booing yet.

01:15.343 --> 01:18.179
Well, it's a big book with
your name on it.
That's all we need to know.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.581
It's a strict rule book
on how to follow rules.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.716
"Rule number one:
Follow the rules."

01:25.619 --> 01:29.223
I'll read the rest of
the rules on the way.
Titans, go!

01:29.257 --> 01:32.460
"Rule 213: Apples are to be
eaten bottom to top.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.228
"No more of this
sideways nonsense.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.396
"And when disposing
of the stem..."

01:35.429 --> 01:36.864
-Oh, no.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.532
Not him.

01:40.934 --> 01:45.539
You am safe from
fireless building now.
No thanks to Nibor.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.777
Why's that dude saving that
other dude from nothing?

01:51.245 --> 01:52.780
And why does he look
exactly like you?

01:52.813 --> 01:55.449
Except, slightly
more handsome.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.288
Yeah.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.690
"Rule 75:
I'm the handsome one."

02:02.723 --> 02:06.494
And he's from Bizarro World,
where everyone is the opposite
of someone here.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.930
ROBIN: He's my opposite.
Lacking my intelligence,
leadership

02:09.963 --> 02:12.166
and incredible
athletic ability.

02:14.535 --> 02:15.536
Ahh!

02:15.569 --> 02:16.904
ROBIN: Urgh!

02:16.937 --> 02:19.940
Ah! Everyone, this is Nibor.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.610
Goodbye, bad to meet you all.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.645
Rude. So, so, rude.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.779
That's Bizarro-speak.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.648
He usually says the opposite
of what he really means.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.817
So, for him,
up actually means...

02:29.850 --> 02:31.252
Sideways?

02:31.285 --> 02:33.221
No, Beast Boy.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.255
Backwards.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.489
Keep trying.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.593
No.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.695
What are you
doing here, Nibor?

02:41.729 --> 02:45.266
Bizarro Titans say, me do
great job as leader
and they kick me out.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.668
So now Nibor
protect Jump City.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.303
Oh, no.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.604
Dog be held hostage!

02:54.542 --> 02:57.211
Maybe we should take him back
to the Tower, until we figure
out what to do with him.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.954
How dare you let me into your
ugly home.

03:06.987 --> 03:10.758
If you don't like it, bro,
then you can get out.

03:10.791 --> 03:13.694
No, Beast Boy.
He's saying he likes
our place.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.596
Opposite

03:15.629 --> 03:17.831
Perhaps we should converse
more with Nibor,

03:17.865 --> 03:22.536
to better understand this
strange and inconsistent
manner of speech.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.905
GAMESHOW HOST:
It's the "Backward Talk" game.

03:24.938 --> 03:29.410
Where contestants
battle it out to try to guess
what Nibor is really saying.

03:29.443 --> 03:33.381
Me hate justice and want
to set all criminals free.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.284
So, you love justice and want
all criminals in jail.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.451
It's kind of fun.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.353
HOST: That's right Cyborg.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.323
-Ooh, let me try.
-Me hate pizza.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.325
No way, pizza is great!

03:44.358 --> 03:46.460
HOST: Ooh, that's
gonna cost ya.

03:46.494 --> 03:49.430
No, Beast Boy, he means
me love pizza.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.598
HOST: Now that's more like it.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.500
Yes, yes, yes. Me hate pizza.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.268
You're so wrong, bro!

03:54.302 --> 03:55.403
So wrong!

03:55.436 --> 03:57.338
I can't even
look at your face.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.507
Pizza's so good.
That warm cheese when it goes
down your throat.

03:59.540 --> 04:03.811
HOST: And that's all the time
we have for
the "Backward Talk" game.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.947
Okay, Titans.
Time for more
Rules of Robin.

04:06.980 --> 04:12.353
"Rule 52: A superhero must
train a minimum of three
times a day."

04:13.954 --> 04:16.324
Ooh, me train. Watch.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.493
Whoa.

04:19.527 --> 04:23.597
I totally get him now.
I wanna train like Nibor.

04:23.631 --> 04:24.998
Me too!

04:26.400 --> 04:28.602
Way ahead of you.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.739
I never knew that training
could be so nice.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.508
Argh!

04:34.542 --> 04:36.644
This is the opposite
of training.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.513
We're just following
Nibor's lead.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.382
If Nibor wants to stay,

04:41.415 --> 04:42.983
he has to follow the rules.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.085
Nibor promise to follow rules.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.587
Thank you. Now,

04:46.620 --> 04:50.324
let's get back to
The Rules of Robin.

05:22.890 --> 05:28.061
NIBOR: Calling all Titans!
Please report to living room
for three hours of cardio.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.563
Cardio!

05:29.597 --> 05:31.965
Who's ready to get sweaty?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.634
Have a seat, Robin.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.770
A seat?
But, uh, that's the opposite
of cardio.

05:36.804 --> 05:40.007
Yes. We have called you here
under false pretenses

05:40.040 --> 05:43.043
to tell you we are
making Nibor our new leader.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.714
-Me promise to be a cruel
and unfair leader.

05:46.747 --> 05:51.018
-But rule 637 states...
-Sorry, bruh, we like
Nibor's rules better.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.886
He doesn't have any.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.856
Don't take it personally.
We just like the opposite
of you better.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.224
Look, guys,

05:57.257 --> 05:59.660
-there's a reason
I have so many rules.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.596
It's so I can get the best
from each of you

06:02.630 --> 06:04.665
and if Nibor becomes
your leader,

06:04.698 --> 06:08.068
this team will take
a big step backwards.
Literally.

06:08.101 --> 06:13.607
Backwards
Robin, you just helped me
realize something.

06:13.641 --> 06:14.408
Yes?

06:14.442 --> 06:17.911
Nibor is Robin
spelled backwards.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.747
That's crazy.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.750
I'll just go somewhere
I'm appreciated.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.453
I never thought I'd have to
use this.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.656
-Wah!

06:40.000 --> 06:41.435
Aah!

06:44.204 --> 06:45.539
Aah!

06:51.845 --> 06:54.915
ALL:
Not reporting for duty, sir.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.485
I don't know why I didn't
come here years ago.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.187
You guys are everything
I ever wanted in a team.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.056
The exact opposite of my team.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.693
Grobyc.
The opposite of Cyborg.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.996
Quiet, thoughtful
and 99% human.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.998
Nevar. The opposite of Raven.

07:11.031 --> 07:14.702
Great attitude, smiles a lot,
into spring fashion trends.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.837
Boy Beast.
The opposite of Beast Boy.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.039
Smart as a whip
and a real go getter,

07:19.072 --> 07:22.810
with the ability to turn into
any boy in the world.

07:22.843 --> 07:26.113
And Erifrats.
The opposite of Starfire.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.518
Well, maybe not everyone
is an improvement.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.186
Me put you in friend zone.

07:35.856 --> 07:36.957
Stay back! Now,

07:36.990 --> 07:38.826
tell me why you
got rid of Nibor.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.228
Nibor never always
want to train.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.564
Only eat the junk food
and sleep.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.499
Me need structure.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.034
Then do I have a book for you.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.770
What do you think?
Can I be your new leader?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.038
ALL: No!

07:51.071 --> 07:53.674
Now, let's follow some rules.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.743
Bizarro Titans, go!

08:01.882 --> 08:03.917
Excellent form on those
hurdles, Grobyc.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.522
Aah!
He compliment Grobyc's form.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.690
Who he not think he is?

08:13.761 --> 08:15.563
You're doing amazing, Nevar.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.100
Hm. How polite.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.706
Almost there, Boy Beast.
Keep it up!

08:27.641 --> 08:29.577
Him too nice. Aah!

08:29.610 --> 08:31.144
Great job, guys.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.118
Great work today, team!

08:38.151 --> 08:39.687
You really outdid yourselves.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.890
We enjoying your leadership
very much, Robin.

08:42.923 --> 08:43.891
Thank you.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.894
And me feelings for you
have not changed at all.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.329
Wait, is that backwards talk?

08:49.362 --> 08:50.631
No.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.765
Was that backwards talk?

08:51.799 --> 08:54.635
-Yes.
-Hmm, very confusing.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.604
But, I'm going to assume,
you all love me.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.306
Now, excuse me while I
work up that new training
regimen.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.075
I am just, loving these
Bizarro Titans.

09:02.109 --> 09:06.647
Ugh! Me did not know that
Robin such inspirational and
great leader.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.548
What am we do then?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.985
Me not have the plan.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.859
Am you enjoying
training, Titans?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.260
Ha ha!

09:20.293 --> 09:23.831
Man, making Nibor team leader
was the best idea
we've ever had.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.767
Training time am over, Nibor.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.937
Bizarro Titans and... Robin?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.773
What are you doing here?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.975
Ah, nothing much.
They just brought me over here
to tell you personally,

09:35.008 --> 09:38.746
what a great job I'm doing
and how they never want me
to leave.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.014
That is what the
Bizarro's said?

09:41.048 --> 09:42.983
Yes.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.986
The backwards talking guys
told you how much
they love you?

09:46.019 --> 09:49.356
They wouldn't stop saying
how much they love me...
Argh!

09:51.825 --> 09:54.828
We am healthy and rested
of Robin.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.831
-Give us back Nibor, later!
-Aah!

09:57.865 --> 09:59.833
Listen up,
you backward bozo's.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.068
We don't want Robin.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.170
ROBIN: Aah!

10:03.203 --> 10:05.205
We want him very much.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.373
ROBIN: Aah!

10:06.406 --> 10:07.675
You keep him.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.345
Start!

10:12.379 --> 10:16.884
Me did not know Bizarro Titans
care so little about Nibor.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.019
Me am sorry for not leaving.

10:19.052 --> 10:23.791
It okay, Nibor,
you know we always
hate you.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.194
Urgh!

10:32.432 --> 10:34.968
Come off, guys.
Let's not go home.
