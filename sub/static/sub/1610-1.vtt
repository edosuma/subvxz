00:31.440 --> 00:34.523
<i>Let us tell an old story anew,</i>

00:34.600 --> 00:37.968
<i>and we will see how well you know it.</i>

00:38.760 --> 00:40.171
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

00:40.240 --> 00:43.562
<i>there were two kingdoms
that were the worst of neighbors.</i>

00:43.640 --> 00:46.564
<i>So vast was the discord between them</i>

00:46.640 --> 00:49.246
<i>that it was said only a great hero</i>

00:49.360 --> 00:52.648
<i>or a terrible villain
might bring them together.</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:56.008
<i>In one kingdom
lived folk like you and me,</i>

00:56.080 --> 00:59.482
<i>with a vain and greedy king
to rule over them.</i>

01:00.200 --> 01:02.089
<i>They were forever discontent,</i>

01:02.160 --> 01:05.289
<i>and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors.</i>

01:06.240 --> 01:08.766
<i>For in the other kingdom, the Moors,</i>

01:08.880 --> 01:13.010
<i>lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.</i>

01:13.800 --> 01:16.280
<i>And they needed
neither king nor queen,</i>

01:16.360 --> 01:18.010
<i>but trusted in one another.</i>

01:20.680 --> 01:24.241
<i>In a great tree
on a great cliff in the Moors</i>

01:24.320 --> 01:26.721
<i>lived one such spirit.</i>

01:26.800 --> 01:29.770
<i>You might take her for a girl,</i>

01:30.280 --> 01:33.363
<i>but she was not just any girl.</i>

01:34.000 --> 01:36.367
<i>She was a fairy.</i>

02:04.200 --> 02:05.725
There you go.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.370
<i>And her name</i>

02:08.600 --> 02:09.965
<i>was Maleficent.</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:21.804
Good morning, Mr. Chanterelle!

02:22.040 --> 02:23.690
I love your cap!

02:29.240 --> 02:31.163
No. No, don't do it!

02:36.560 --> 02:37.561
You missed me!

02:39.240 --> 02:41.208
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.490
Lovely work, girls!

03:07.680 --> 03:08.720
What's all the fuss about?

03:08.880 --> 03:09.847
The border guards have discov...

03:09.960 --> 03:11.200
Why do you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!

03:11.280 --> 03:12.280
I want to!

03:12.320 --> 03:15.130
There are rules, Flittle.
I tell this time, you tell next time.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.606
No, you told last time,

03:16.720 --> 03:18.800
so I should tell this time,
and Thistlewit next time.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.201
Tell me what?

03:20.520 --> 03:21.567
Fine!

03:21.960 --> 03:22.961
Thank you.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.920
Maleficent, the border guard...

03:24.960 --> 03:28.328
The border guards have found
a human thief at the pool of jewels.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.811
I'm sorry.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.847
She's always in a hurry,
with her big wings.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.523
Humans, here.
I hope there's not another war.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.404
I'm not afraid.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.848
Besides,
I have never seen a human up close.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.001
Come out!

04:02.520 --> 04:05.251
No. They mean to kill me.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.920
And besides, they're hideous to look at.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.970
That's extremely rude.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.008
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.
You're classically handsome.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.170
It's not right to steal,

04:19.519 --> 04:21.601
but we don't kill people for it.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.727
Come out.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.611
Come out this instant!

04:37.320 --> 04:38.606
Are you fully grown?

04:39.520 --> 04:40.521
No.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.802
I believe he's just a boy.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.964
And you're just a girl.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.166
I think.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.241
Who are you?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.245
I'm called Stefan.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.041
Who are you?

04:53.680 --> 04:54.761
I'm Maleficent.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.811
Yes, right.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.401
You have to give it back.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.446
Give what back?

05:25.560 --> 05:29.246
If I knew you would throw it away,
I would have kept it.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.606
I didn't throw it away.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.084
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.886
Someday, you know, I'll live there.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.889
In the castle.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.965
Where do you live now?

05:49.640 --> 05:50.641
In a barn.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.124
So your parents are farmers, then?

05:54.280 --> 05:56.282
My parents are dead.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.766
Mine, too.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.890
We'll see each other again.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.526
You really shouldn't
come back here, you know.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.170
It's not safe.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.687
And if I made that choice,

06:14.880 --> 06:16.769
if I came back, would you be here?

06:18.760 --> 06:19.807
Perhaps.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.604
- What's wrong?
- Your ring.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.891
Iron burns fairies.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.407
I'm sorry.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.484
I like your wings.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.041
<i>Maleficent thought of how
Stefan cast away his ring,</i>

06:44.320 --> 06:46.687
<i>he who had so little in the world,</i>

06:46.800 --> 06:48.768
<i>so that their hands might touch again,</i>

06:49.720 --> 06:52.564
<i>and her heart was moved.</i>

06:52.840 --> 06:55.923
<i>Thus did the young thief
who had hoped to steal a jewel...</i>

06:56.000 --> 06:57.001
Maleficent!

06:57.080 --> 06:59.526
<i>...steal something far more precious.</i>

06:59.960 --> 07:01.530
Maleficent?

07:04.360 --> 07:05.566
Maleficent!

07:10.360 --> 07:11.600
After all these weeks,

07:12.000 --> 07:13.490
look who came back.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.482
I thought it worth the risk.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.407
So, what do you do for fun?

07:30.040 --> 07:34.125
<i>Stefan and Maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends.</i>

07:34.680 --> 07:38.366
<i>And for a time it seemed as if,
in them at least,</i>

07:38.720 --> 07:42.805
<i>the old hatred between men and fairies
had been forgotten.</i>

07:43.760 --> 07:47.890
<i>As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.</i>

07:54.920 --> 07:57.321
<i>And on her 16th birthday,</i>

07:57.400 --> 07:59.767
<i>Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.</i>

08:02.120 --> 08:04.726
<i>He told her it was true love's kiss.</i>

08:07.880 --> 08:09.848
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

08:11.920 --> 08:16.721
<i>As the years passed, Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,</i>

08:16.800 --> 08:20.600
<i>and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.</i>

08:21.200 --> 08:24.204
<i>While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,</i>

08:24.280 --> 08:27.250
<i>rose to become
the protector of the Moors.</i>

09:14.720 --> 09:17.041
<i>Maleficent often wandered alone</i>

09:17.160 --> 09:20.164
<i>and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,</i>

09:20.640 --> 09:24.042
<i>for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.</i>

09:25.280 --> 09:27.248
<i>But she was to learn.</i>

09:28.000 --> 09:32.085
<i>For the human king had heard
of a growing power in the Moors,</i>

09:32.160 --> 09:35.084
<i>and he sought to strike it down.</i>

09:56.120 --> 09:57.963
Guard, halt!

09:59.000 --> 10:00.650
Guard, halt!

10:11.760 --> 10:13.205
There they are,

10:14.040 --> 10:18.125
the mysterious Moors
where no one dares to venture

10:18.200 --> 10:21.522
for fear of the magical creatures
that lurk within.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.122
Well, I say crush them!

10:44.120 --> 10:46.248
Go no further!

10:48.000 --> 10:49.570
A king

10:49.640 --> 10:53.281
does not take orders from a winged elf.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.323
You are no king to me.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.247
- Bring me her head.
- Battalion!

11:12.720 --> 11:13.801
Advance!

11:19.600 --> 11:21.443
Arise and stand with me!

11:27.280 --> 11:28.770
Hold the line!

11:41.600 --> 11:44.046
- It's the dark creatures!
- It's the dark creatures!

12:05.360 --> 12:07.647
Charge!

13:05.120 --> 13:06.201
You!

13:10.200 --> 13:11.406
To the king!

13:18.760 --> 13:20.250
You will not have the Moors!

13:20.440 --> 13:22.363
Not now, nor ever!

13:22.880 --> 13:23.881
You...

14:02.560 --> 14:05.006
When I ascended to the throne,

14:06.720 --> 14:09.246
I promised the people

14:09.800 --> 14:12.485
one day we would take

14:13.440 --> 14:15.920
the Moors and its treasures.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.610
Each of you

14:19.400 --> 14:24.281
swore allegiance to me
and to that cause.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.881
Your Majesty.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.768
Defeated in battle.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.489
Is this to be my legacy?

14:42.120 --> 14:45.647
I see you waiting for me to die.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.569
It won't be long. But what then?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.009
I will choose a successor

14:52.720 --> 14:55.849
to take the throne
and care for my daughter.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.606
Who among you

14:59.520 --> 15:01.329
is worthy?

15:02.280 --> 15:05.329
Kill the winged creature.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.084
Avenge me,

15:07.560 --> 15:11.326
and upon my death
you will take the crown.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.529
Maleficent.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.568
Maleficent!

15:51.240 --> 15:54.210
So, how is life with the humans?

15:57.160 --> 16:00.289
Maleficent, I've come to warn you.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.205
They mean to kill you.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.767
King Henry will stop at nothing.

16:08.320 --> 16:11.563
Please, you have to trust me.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.687
<i>They spoke of many things,</i>

16:17.760 --> 16:19.524
<i>and the years faded</i> away.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.329
<i>And she forgave Stefan
his folly and his ambition,</i>

16:25.920 --> 16:29.163
<i>and all was as it had been long ago.</i>

16:32.080 --> 16:33.366
You thirsty?

17:08.319 --> 17:09.651
Maleficent?

19:25.560 --> 19:26.561
What is this?

19:29.680 --> 19:31.921
I have avenged you, sire.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.762
She is vanquished?

19:38.680 --> 19:40.648
You have done well, my son.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.447
You have done
what others feared to do.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.602
You will be rewarded.

19:49.120 --> 19:53.330
I shall do my best
to be a worthy successor,

19:54.160 --> 19:55.605
Your Majesty.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.050
I've got you!

22:13.480 --> 22:15.528
- You wicked bird!
- lnto a man.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.531
It's a...

22:29.560 --> 22:30.846
It's a demon!

22:44.600 --> 22:47.171
What have you done
to my beautiful self?

22:47.240 --> 22:49.208
Would you
rather I let them beat you to death?

22:51.080 --> 22:52.411
I'm not certain.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.084
Stop complaining.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.290
I saved your life.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.725
Forgive me.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.766
What do I call you?

23:03.280 --> 23:04.770
Diaval.

23:05.440 --> 23:08.603
And in return for saving my life,
I am your servant.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.170
Whatever you need.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.726
Wings.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.329
I need you to be my wings.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.690
I present to you the first of his line,

23:40.160 --> 23:43.562
His Royal Highness King Stefan.

24:06.520 --> 24:10.764
He did this to me so he would be king.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.610
Now what, Mistress?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.764
Her wings!

26:00.320 --> 26:01.481
It's a girl!

26:02.160 --> 26:03.924
It's a girl! It's a girl!

26:27.320 --> 26:28.367
Well?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.243
Well, I saw nothing.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.601
But there's been a...

26:34.280 --> 26:35.281
What?

26:37.760 --> 26:38.921
Child.

26:40.840 --> 26:43.684
King Stefan and the Queen
have had a child.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.682
There will be a christening.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.209
They say it's to be a grand celebration.

26:55.120 --> 26:59.682
A grand celebration for a baby.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.526
How wonderful.

27:19.560 --> 27:22.803
<i>All manner of folk
came to the christening,</i>

27:22.880 --> 27:27.169
<i>even a trio of fairies who sought
to foster peace and goodwill.</i>

27:27.240 --> 27:29.208
Look, there's the baby!

27:29.280 --> 27:30.520
I love babies!

27:30.600 --> 27:33.729
Can you just concentrate, please?
I'm not telling you again.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.011
Greetings, Your Majesty.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.651
I am Knotgrass
of the Moorland Fair Folk.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.609
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.366
And I'm Thistlewit, Your Royalnesses.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.450
They bring gifts for our daughter.

27:55.720 --> 28:00.328
These are not just any old gifts,
for, you see, we're magic!

28:00.880 --> 28:02.370
And very good with children.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.930
Very well.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.967
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you

28:15.360 --> 28:18.045
the gift of beauty.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.801
My wish is that you will never be blue,

28:27.120 --> 28:30.806
only happy, all the days of your life.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.084
Sweet baby,

28:38.880 --> 28:41.565
my wish for you is that you find...

29:03.000 --> 29:05.321
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!

29:16.800 --> 29:18.609
Well, well.

29:23.240 --> 29:27.040
What a glittering assemblage,
King Stefan.

29:31.360 --> 29:36.844
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and...

29:39.240 --> 29:40.446
How quaint.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.723
Even the rabble.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.564
I must say

29:54.080 --> 29:58.881
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.130
You're not welcome here.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.686
Oh, dear.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.561
What an awkward situation.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.405
You're not offended?

30:17.920 --> 30:20.161
Why, no.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.406
And to show I bear no ill will,

30:26.560 --> 30:30.770
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.610
No! We don't want your gift!

30:36.400 --> 30:38.084
Stay away from the princess!

30:38.160 --> 30:40.162
Yes, stay away!

30:57.440 --> 30:59.408
Listen well, all of you.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.960
<i>Listen well, all of you.</i>

31:02.480 --> 31:08.283
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

31:08.880 --> 31:12.009
beloved by all who meet her.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.051
That's a lovely gift.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.480
Don't do this.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.366
But

31:38.480 --> 31:43.281
before the sun sets
on her 16th birthday,

31:44.000 --> 31:47.641
she will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel

31:47.960 --> 31:50.406
and fall into a sleep like death,

31:51.280 --> 31:55.490
a sleep from which
she will never awaken.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.086
Maleficent, please don't do this,
I'm begging you.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.283
I like you begging.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.010
Do it again.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.486
I beg you.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.165
All right.

32:34.520 --> 32:39.287
The princess can be woken
from her death sleep,

32:40.560 --> 32:42.688
but only by

32:43.720 --> 32:45.882
true love's kiss.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.886
This curse will last till the end of time!

32:51.400 --> 32:54.051
No power on Earth can change it.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.570
<i>King Stefan ordered his men</i>

33:11.640 --> 33:14.371
<i>to seize every spinning wheel
in the kingdom.</i>

33:14.760 --> 33:19.322
<i>The wheels were broken and burned,
that they might never be used,</i>

33:19.400 --> 33:23.371
<i>and thrown into the deepest dungeon
in the castle.</i>

33:24.400 --> 33:27.483
<i>Secretly, he entrusted
the safety of the child</i>

33:27.560 --> 33:29.847
<i>to the magic of the pixies,</i>

33:29.920 --> 33:35.290
<i>who would take her to a remote
hideaway for 16 years and a day.</i>

33:39.480 --> 33:43.201
<i>Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle</i>

33:43.760 --> 33:49.369
<i>while his soldiers rode far and wide
to hunt Maleficent down.</i>

33:50.480 --> 33:53.006
<i>But she made walls of her own,</i>

33:53.280 --> 33:56.727
<i>that the Moors might
never again suffer the touch</i>

33:56.800 --> 33:58.802
<i>of any human.</i>

34:00.720 --> 34:05.965
<i>And she reveled in the sorrow
that her curse had brought.</i>

34:10.280 --> 34:12.647
<i>The fairies began their charge</i>

34:12.719 --> 34:16.690
<i>to raise Aurora in a snug little cottage
in the woods.</i>

34:17.239 --> 34:19.971
No! Is this it?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.329
Looks dreadful.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.165
Come on.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.011
We need a smaller...

34:27.080 --> 34:28.206
Baby-

34:28.280 --> 34:30.009
Or bigger bodies.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.641
No, what we need is a proper disguise.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.085
What do you mean?

34:35.159 --> 34:37.083
Well, we have to blend in, don't we?

34:37.360 --> 34:39.280
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.969
So, gather around, ladies.

34:43.679 --> 34:47.002
Get ready. One, two, three, grow!

34:51.239 --> 34:53.481
That's worked quite well.
That's very nice.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.603
Now, there will be no questions asked.

34:56.679 --> 34:57.681
We are no longer fairies.

34:57.880 --> 35:00.451
We are three peasant women
raising our orphan child in the woods.

35:00.520 --> 35:03.490
- Yes.
- So, no more flying.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.406
- No flying?
- No, no, and no magic.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.891
- No magic?
- Yes, you heard.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.126
It's in the middle of nowhere.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.680
At least no one will find us here.

35:19.520 --> 35:23.127
There you are.
Why are you always hiding?

35:23.200 --> 35:25.202
Come on. There you go.

35:43.880 --> 35:47.362
It's so ugly, you could
almost feel sorry for it.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.487
I hate you. Beasty.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.771
<i>The fairies were
perhaps unequal to their task.</i>

36:10.720 --> 36:12.131
Why is she crying?

36:12.200 --> 36:13.565
I think she might be hungry.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.251
Then feed her!

36:26.360 --> 36:29.330
There you are.

36:29.640 --> 36:30.880
There you go.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.005
It's going to starve
with those three looking after it.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.770
It tickles.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.969
- What?
- You're cheating.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.520
I saw that!

37:26.840 --> 37:28.808
- We're starting again.
- Suit yourself.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.930
Greedy, bloated goat!

37:34.400 --> 37:35.970
"Bloated goat."

37:39.920 --> 37:41.160
Stop doing that.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.605
I'm not doing anything.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.006
Well, someone is.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.401
It's not me.

37:48.520 --> 37:52.047
You two are having a go at me,
and I will not tolerate...

37:53.760 --> 37:54.966
Stop it!

38:06.160 --> 38:07.161
Why...

38:12.400 --> 38:14.209
No!

38:14.760 --> 38:16.000
This is all your fault!

38:27.400 --> 38:29.050
Come on. That's funny.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.649
<i>As the days went on, Stefan darkened,</i>

38:34.720 --> 38:37.963
<i>further consumed
by paranoia and vengeance.</i>

38:38.240 --> 38:40.766
- Burn it all down!
- Yes, sir!

38:41.080 --> 38:42.445
Flame!

38:45.240 --> 38:46.241
Release!

39:20.480 --> 39:21.891
Run!

39:35.120 --> 39:36.121
You failed me.

39:37.960 --> 39:42.124
The wall cannot be burned.
It is indestructible.

39:47.280 --> 39:49.521
Nothing is indestructible!

39:50.480 --> 39:54.804
Not the wall! Not Maleficent!
Not even her curse!

40:13.200 --> 40:15.282
Bring me the iron workers.

40:39.840 --> 40:40.921
You!

40:52.600 --> 40:53.726
Look.

40:54.320 --> 40:57.642
The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.721
What?

41:43.400 --> 41:45.209
Hello.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.207
Go away.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.126
Go.

42:00.840 --> 42:01.841
Go away.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.282
I don't like children.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.644
Up, UP-

42:28.800 --> 42:30.882
Go along. Go, go, go.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.130
<i>As Maleficent had said,</i>

42:45.560 --> 42:49.326
<i>Aurora did grow in grace and beauty.</i>

42:52.560 --> 42:53.971
Pretty bird.

42:55.480 --> 42:59.280
<i>Far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not.</i>

43:02.640 --> 43:06.850
<i>And as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew,</i>

43:07.560 --> 43:09.085
<i>so did she.</i>

43:23.160 --> 43:24.161
Hello.

43:25.160 --> 43:26.161
That's it.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.371
There you go.

43:33.440 --> 43:36.091
<i>She wondered at the world about her,</i>

43:40.400 --> 43:44.689
<i>and at what lay beyond
the fearsome wall of thorns.</i>

43:54.920 --> 43:56.922
Curious little beasty.

43:57.760 --> 44:01.082
<i>But she was not the only one
who wished to get through.</i>

44:04.640 --> 44:05.641
Look.

44:07.680 --> 44:12.049
- Is that her? Is that Maleficent?
- I don't know.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.165
Bring them to me.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.409
No, it's just a silly peasant girl.

44:47.960 --> 44:49.200
Steady.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.522
- It's her!
- It's her!

46:23.840 --> 46:24.960
How could you do that to me?

46:25.200 --> 46:27.043
You said anything I need.

46:27.320 --> 46:28.321
Yeah, but not a dog.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.525
It was a wolf, not a dog.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.326
It's the same thing.

46:32.920 --> 46:36.367
They're dirty, vicious,
and they hunt birds.

46:36.520 --> 46:39.763
Fine. Next time I'll turn you
into a mealy worm.

46:39.840 --> 46:43.401
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly.
Anything but a filthy, stinking...

46:53.200 --> 46:54.770
I wonder.

48:36.640 --> 48:37.926
I know you're there.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.891
Don't be afraid.

48:43.560 --> 48:44.846
I am not afraid.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.684
Then come out.

48:48.680 --> 48:50.489
Then you'll be afraid.

48:51.280 --> 48:52.520
No, I won't.

49:09.600 --> 49:10.806
I know who you are.

49:12.520 --> 49:13.567
Do you?

49:15.920 --> 49:17.888
You're my Fairy Godmother.

49:20.720 --> 49:21.767
What?

49:22.080 --> 49:23.844
Fairy Godmother.

49:24.200 --> 49:26.567
You've been watching over me
my whole life.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.202
I've always known you were close by.

49:30.720 --> 49:31.846
How?

49:31.920 --> 49:35.925
Your shadow. It's been following me
ever since I was small.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.085
Wherever I went,
your shadow was always with me.

49:42.360 --> 49:43.566
I remember you.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.925
Pretty bird.

49:47.680 --> 49:48.920
This is Diaval.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.161
Hello, Aurora.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.961
I have known you
since you were a little one.

50:07.040 --> 50:09.566
It's everything I imagined it would be.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.083
It's just so beautiful!
I've always wanted to come...

51:00.960 --> 51:02.962
Good night, beasty.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.090
You mock me.

51:18.080 --> 51:20.401
I know what you're doing.

51:21.160 --> 51:24.289
I know exactly what you're doing.

51:24.360 --> 51:25.361
Sire?

51:25.840 --> 51:28.127
Your presence has been
requested by the Queen.

51:28.800 --> 51:29.847
Leave me.

51:30.440 --> 51:32.124
Sire, she is not well.

51:32.640 --> 51:36.042
The nurses are fearful
that she won't make it through the night.

51:39.680 --> 51:43.048
Can you not see
we're having a conversation?

51:51.640 --> 51:54.610
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.

51:54.680 --> 51:58.241
And on that day, I will be ready.

52:12.840 --> 52:14.729
They're so beautiful.

53:30.120 --> 53:32.248
I revoke the curse.

53:33.640 --> 53:35.802
Let it be no more.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.569
I revoke the curse.

53:40.320 --> 53:42.641
Let it be no more.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.569
I revoke my curse!

53:46.880 --> 53:49.565
Let it be no more!

53:50.320 --> 53:52.049
I revoke my curse!

53:52.920 --> 53:55.924
Let it be no more!

53:58.160 --> 54:00.925
Let it be no more!

54:08.880 --> 54:12.487
<i>This curse will last till the end of time.</i>

54:13.560 --> 54:16.166
<i>No power on Earth can change it.</i>

54:38.080 --> 54:40.560
Do all the Fair People have wings?

54:43.080 --> 54:44.650
Most do.

54:45.080 --> 54:46.923
Then why don't you?

54:47.920 --> 54:50.002
All the other fairies fly.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.646
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.804
That's all I wish to say about it.

54:57.680 --> 54:59.284
What color were they?

55:00.200 --> 55:01.406
Were they big?

55:04.880 --> 55:08.043
So big
they dragged behind me when I walked.

55:09.600 --> 55:11.762
And they were strong.

55:11.840 --> 55:14.844
They could carry me above the clouds
and into the headwinds.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.210
And they never faltered, not even once.

55:20.920 --> 55:22.160
I could trust them.

55:48.960 --> 55:51.930
She's coming. She's coming.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.007
Where are your workers?

55:59.800 --> 56:01.370
In their beds, Majesty.

56:01.720 --> 56:04.041
Get them back to work without delay.

56:04.440 --> 56:05.930
They're exhausted, sire.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.810
But I'll have them
back to work at first light.

56:10.720 --> 56:12.802
I need them back to work now.

56:12.960 --> 56:14.610
It's the wee hours.

56:17.960 --> 56:19.086
Aye.

56:20.720 --> 56:21.801
Aye.

56:23.120 --> 56:24.531
It is the wee hours.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.690
So wake them up.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.650
Sire?

56:31.800 --> 56:34.804
So wake them up,
and get them back to work now!

56:35.040 --> 56:38.089
We're running out of time! Go, now!

57:07.800 --> 57:08.881
Aurora?

57:10.160 --> 57:11.491
Come here.

57:21.080 --> 57:22.286
Sit.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.525
There's something I need to tell you.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.485
What is it?

57:32.520 --> 57:35.205
There is an evil in this world,

57:36.440 --> 57:38.522
and I cannot keep you from it.

57:39.800 --> 57:42.246
I'm almost 16, Godmother.

57:42.520 --> 57:44.090
I can take care of myself.

57:44.640 --> 57:46.165
I understand.

57:48.880 --> 57:51.161
- But that's not what I have to tell you.
- I have a plan.

57:52.280 --> 57:53.611
When I'm older,

57:53.680 --> 57:56.251
I'm going to live here
in the Moors with you.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.928
Then we can look after each other.

58:04.800 --> 58:07.724
You don't have to wait until you're older.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.166
You could live here now.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.404
Then I Will.

58:13.200 --> 58:16.682
I'll sleep in a tree
and eat berries and black nuts

58:16.760 --> 58:19.411
and all the Fair People
will be my friends.

58:21.760 --> 58:23.762
I'll be happy here for the rest of my life.

58:24.920 --> 58:27.287
I'm going to tell my aunties tomorrow.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.684
Until tomorrow.

58:32.600 --> 58:33.806
I'm so excited!

58:50.960 --> 58:53.281
Aunties, I'm almost 16.

58:53.600 --> 58:55.648
I need a life of my own.

58:55.760 --> 58:58.889
No. I love you very much,

58:59.760 --> 59:01.250
but it's time to say goodbye.

59:01.800 --> 59:03.484
You've been very good to me,

59:03.680 --> 59:06.524
except the time
you accidentally fed me spiders.

59:11.680 --> 59:12.681
Hello.

59:15.360 --> 59:17.328
I'm sorry to bother you,

59:17.400 --> 59:19.000
but I'm on my way
to King Stefan's castle

59:19.040 --> 59:21.930
and I've become hopelessly lost.

59:22.320 --> 59:23.401
Can you help me?

59:24.480 --> 59:26.926
I'm sorry. That was my fault.
I rushed in too...

59:33.600 --> 59:35.045
Forgive me.

59:38.160 --> 59:39.844
It's that way.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.490
The castle.

59:51.440 --> 59:52.680
What's your name?

59:53.200 --> 59:54.440
It's Philip.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.566
Hello, Philip.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.331
What's yours?

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.891
Aurora.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.244
Hello, Aurora.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.087
Well, it was nice meeting you.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.846
And once again, my apologies
for being such a clumsy fool.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.046
You're forgiven.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.804
That's good.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.211
I'd best be off, then.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.245
Good bye.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.762
Will you be back this way?

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.885
Nothing could stop me.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.245
Then I'll see you soon.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.411
Very soon.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.643
- Goodbye, Philip.
- Goodbye, for now.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.363
Stop doing that.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.245
Well?

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.251
That boy's the answer.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.089
- No, Diaval.
- Yes!

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.926
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.048
True love's kiss?

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.164
Have you not worked it out yet?

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.929
I cursed her that way
because there is no such thing.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.408
Well, that might be how you feel,

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.601
but what about Aurora?

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.763
That boy could be her only chance.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.760
It's her fate, anyway.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.121
Go ahead.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.727
Turn me into whatever you want.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.926
A bird, a worm.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.169
I don't care anymore.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.002
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.209
We are not leaving tomorrow.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.408
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.486
And Stefan told us to take her back
the day after her birthday.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.804
No. He said on her birthday.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.282
No. The day after her birthday.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.970
- On.
- After.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.286
- On.
- After.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.763
- On, on, on!
- After, after, after!

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.004
Stop it!

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.007
What?

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.525
How could you?

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.682
I need to talk to you about something.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.161
Yes, sweetie, what is it?

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.329
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.963
but I'll be 16 tomorrow.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.126
Yes.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.967
I'm leaving home.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.040
See here, young lady.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.200
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.520
with these two imbeciles...

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.801
So that you could ruin it on the last day.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.326
We are taking you back
to your father with...

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.571
My father?

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.402
You told me my parents were dead.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:38.210
I think you better come and sit down.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.483
Fairy Godmother!

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.211
I'm here.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.445
When were you going to tell me
that I'm cursed?

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.760
Is it true?

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.006
It is.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.403
My aunts said it was an evil fairy.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.285
I... I can't remember her name.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.525
They said

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.726
it was...

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.605
Maleficent.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.650
Is that you?

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.688
Are you Maleficent?

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.280
No!

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.325
Don't touch me.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.724
You're the evil that's in the world.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.451
It's you!

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.641
Find the boy!

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.449
I need every available man
on the east wing now.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.683
There should be no guards at the gate.
I want her to walk right in.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.285
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.563
We found this urchin at the gate.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.248
She claims to be the princess.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.246
Father.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.409
It's me, Aurora!

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.641
You look just like your mother.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.209
They brought you back a day too soon.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.249
I told those three idiots!

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.563
Lock her up in her room.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.166
Go.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.486
Prepare the men. Maleficent's coming.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.210
It's so good to be small again!

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.330
Look at my feet!

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.801
I love my tiny little feet!

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.805
Pay attention! We have to find Aurora,

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.720
or the king will have our heads!

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.921
<i>Aurora.</i>

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.171
Wait!

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.805
Princess?

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.005
I'm looking for a girl.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.250
Of course you are.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.484
I need a horse.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.644
<i>...into a sleep like death.</i>

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.489
<i>Aurora.</i>

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.201
Come on, Diaval!

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.490
<i>Aurora.</i>

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.363
Faster, Diaval, faster!

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:05.046
<i>She will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel</i>

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.648
<i>and fall into a sleep like death.</i>

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.087
<i>No power on Earth...</i>

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.491
<i>A sleep like death.</i>

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.279
It's done.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.809
They pulled the guards.
He's waiting for you in there.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.325
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.123
Then don't come. It's not your fight.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.329
Thank you very much.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:29.890
"I need you, Diaval.
I can't do this without you, Diaval."

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.605
I can hear you.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.041
Look at her.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.722
Look at what you've done.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.364
She's only sleeping.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.605
She's only sleeping, you say?

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.524
She's only sleeping.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.610
She's only sleeping forever!

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.730
- What about the kiss?
- Yes! True love's kiss!

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.850
True love does not exist.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.721
But it's her only chance, Your Majesty.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.851
Mistress.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.329
What are we going to do?

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.807
We can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.969
But we don't even know where to start.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.686
True love doesn't just fall
from trees, you know.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.802
Pardon me.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.327
I'm embarrassed to say
I don't know where I am.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.842
In King Stefan's castle.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.810
This is where I'm meant to be.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.563
Odd that I can't recall how I got here.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.641
Why have you come?

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.564
My father sent me to see the King.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.641
Who is your father?

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.200
King John of Ulstead.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.644
A Prince!

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.165
Aurora.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.169
He knows her.

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.205
Why is she sleeping?

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.682
She's trapped in an enchantment.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.162
Isn't she beautiful?

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.886
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.003
Do you want to kiss her?

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.921
Very much.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.731
Go on, then.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.128
I wouldn't feel right about it.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.850
I barely know her. We've only met once.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.247
Haven't you ever heard
of love at first sight?

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.930
Kiss her!

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.361
Go on.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.520
An enchantment, you say?

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.770
Kiss her!

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.650
You didn't do it properly!

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.446
It's supposed to be true love's kiss!

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.045
I was certain he was the one.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.691
- What are you doing?
- We have to keep looking.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.126
I told you.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.361
I will not ask your forgiveness

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.967
because what I have done to you
is unforgivable.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.050
I was so lost

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.441
in hatred and revenge.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.482
Sweet Aurora,

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.086
you stole what was left of my heart.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.447
And now I have lost you forever.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:35.530
I swear, no harm will come to you
as long as I live.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.801
And not a day shall pass
that I don't miss your smile.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.882
Hello, Godmother.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.209
Hello, beasty.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.570
No truer love.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.730
She's here, sire.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.923
Are we going back to the Moors now?

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.009
If that is what you wish.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.127
We've got her!

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.249
- Stop!
- Get back!

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.766
No!

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.005
Into a dragon.

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.520
To the other side.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.484
Run, Aurora!

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.524
Get back! Hold it steady!

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.564
Pull to the left! Pull!

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.371
Hold the line!

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:22.126
Look out. Hold your line.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.205
- Close in.
- Bring it down!

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.886
Enough!

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.644
How does it feel?

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.606
To be a fairy creature without wings

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.291
in a world where you don't belong?

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.526
Kill her!

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.286
Kill her!

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.770
<i>Shoot!</i>

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.246
Shoot her!

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.601
Take aim!

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:52.601
It's over.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:15.364
<i>Maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns</i>

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.807
<i>and took off her crown.</i>

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.766
<i>And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once,</i>

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.447
<i>long ago, when Maleficent
was but a child</i>

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.761
<i>and her heart was bright.</i>

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.131
<i>For now, it was again.</i>

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.647
<i>But that was not all.</i>

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.411
There she is. Hurry up. They're waiting.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.246
Wait for me!

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.282
We present this crown
to our little Aurora,

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.804
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.765
Never mind.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.003
Our kingdoms have been unified.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.763
You have your queen.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.085
<i>So you see,
the story is not quite as you were told,</i>

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.244
<i>and I should know,</i>

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:26.848
<i>for I was the one
they called Sleeping Beauty.</i>

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:05.286
<i>In the end, my kingdom was united
not by a hero or a villain,</i>

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.283
<i>as legend had predicted,</i>

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.365
<i>but by one who was
both hero and villain.</i>

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.961
<i>And her name was Maleficent.</i>
