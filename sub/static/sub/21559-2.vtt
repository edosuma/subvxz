00:00.141 --> 00:02.171
Previously on "Girlfriends'
Guide to Divorce"...

00:02.241 --> 00:05.288
- Welcome to the launch of...
- BOTH: Lady Parts.

00:05.313 --> 00:07.952
- [all cheer]
- We should have seen

00:07.977 --> 00:09.046
exponential growth at this point.

00:09.070 --> 00:11.137
They want us to hire an influencer.

00:11.172 --> 00:13.050
At the first bump, you go and
find yourself a Gemma Sacco

00:13.074 --> 00:14.707
who makes you feel safe again.

00:14.742 --> 00:16.937
He made me choose
between him and my career,

00:16.962 --> 00:19.029
which we all know is ridiculous.

00:19.054 --> 00:21.190
I wanna have a party. I
need you to art direct it.

00:21.215 --> 00:22.429
I am in.

00:22.462 --> 00:24.427
I was doing some digging
in the Moran case.

00:24.452 --> 00:26.257
The building is owned
by the Christede family,

00:26.282 --> 00:27.875
I wanna bring 'em in and depose 'em.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.945
I'm guessing you never served
a subpoena in your life?

00:30.088 --> 00:31.567
I'm feeling really zen.

00:31.592 --> 00:33.692
I'm just a no-drama mama right now.

00:33.728 --> 00:35.594
The Tao of Rex. I'm
here because I need this.

00:35.630 --> 00:38.097
- As does everyone else.
- I'll fight her.

00:38.132 --> 00:40.199
- [crowd cheering]
- [both grunt]

00:40.242 --> 00:41.375
[groans]

00:41.402 --> 00:43.335
[both breathing heavily]

00:43.371 --> 00:46.739
[upbeat music]

00:46.774 --> 00:50.367
- Is that Temple Hampton?
- That guy she's with is my ex.

00:50.392 --> 00:52.755
- Abby, that's our in.
- We just need a celeb

00:52.780 --> 00:54.647
to Tweet about our site.

00:54.682 --> 00:57.883
I happen to have her phone.

00:57.919 --> 01:01.296
Uh, Lilly, oh, my God. Mom, get out!

01:01.622 --> 01:06.933
- ♪ ♪
- _

01:08.429 --> 01:12.231
♪ Say we'll start to
dance we'll live again... ♪

01:12.266 --> 01:15.201
You guys, thank you for helping.

01:15.236 --> 01:16.435
Moving day.

01:16.471 --> 01:19.071
Jesus these computer boxes are heavy.

01:19.107 --> 01:21.307
- What's in here, Steve Jobs?
- Oh, I wish.

01:21.342 --> 01:22.853
- [gasps]
- Although ever since he's died,

01:22.877 --> 01:25.544
- he gives such bad weather advice.
- Wow, you guys,

01:25.580 --> 01:27.313
your own offices.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.415
I mean, it is Modahaus, but...

01:29.450 --> 01:32.785
Hey, don't downplay
it. We're killing it.

01:32.820 --> 01:36.889
Ooh, someone sent you an
office warming present.

01:36.924 --> 01:38.891
No, no, no, don't eat that, please.

01:38.926 --> 01:42.207
That's for Will for
the influencer Tweet.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.347
The reason why we're killing it.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.776
Although maybe this is
sending the wrong message.

01:46.801 --> 01:50.169
It's like, "Here's a basket
of tasty phallic treats, Will.

01:50.204 --> 01:53.439
Oh, everyone loves biscotti.
You just think it's sexual

01:53.474 --> 01:54.785
'cause you wanna have sex with him.

01:54.809 --> 01:56.609
I do not.

01:56.644 --> 01:58.878
And I have way too much
history with that one.

01:58.913 --> 02:01.113
Hey, sex with an ex can be fun.

02:01.149 --> 02:03.149
I mean, they know how
to work the machinery.

02:03.184 --> 02:04.495
- You know what I'm saying?
- [laughs]

02:04.519 --> 02:05.596
Please stop with the vagina talk.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.219
It's completely contaminated now

02:07.255 --> 02:09.588
ever since I walked
in on Lilly and Ethan.

02:09.624 --> 02:11.590
- Oh, my God, I have PTSD.
- I still cannot believe

02:11.626 --> 02:13.659
that Lilly is porking my baby baker...

02:13.694 --> 02:16.462
Not porking. Nice Jewish girl.

02:16.497 --> 02:19.131
And she swears she's
only doing "other stuff,"

02:19.167 --> 02:21.800
- which is horrifying enough.
- Oh, well that's so good.

02:21.836 --> 02:23.702
- She's talking to you about it.
- Mm-hmm.

02:23.738 --> 02:25.638
I wouldn't exactly call it talking.

02:25.673 --> 02:27.873
I mean, our last conversation
was when I blocked her

02:27.909 --> 02:30.209
on the stairway and she was like,

02:30.244 --> 02:32.678
"Back off. We're not doing
anything stupid."

02:32.713 --> 02:33.891
Oh, it's not like she's gonna have

02:33.915 --> 02:35.581
some prom baby in the bathroom.

02:35.616 --> 02:38.184
- That's not her destiny.
- I'm disappointed.

02:38.219 --> 02:40.653
I was hoping that this
would be one of those things

02:40.688 --> 02:43.255
- that we could share.
- All: Ew.

02:43.291 --> 02:46.659
Ew. No, talking, God.

02:46.694 --> 02:49.066

take you where you wanna go ♪

02:49.091 --> 02:50.621

- Okay, whole wheat or rye?
- You know what, never mind.

02:58.606 --> 03:01.449
Let me get the bacon frittata
on the cheddar biscuit.

03:01.676 --> 03:02.886
You know what, scratch everything.

03:02.910 --> 03:04.510
Let me just get another latte

03:04.545 --> 03:06.731
and hold the milk. Thank you.

03:07.882 --> 03:09.548
What's with the bipolar ordering?

03:09.584 --> 03:11.550
I don't know if I'm
carb-loading or not.

03:11.586 --> 03:13.953
You know, I might go
away to this retreat

03:13.988 --> 03:16.755
over Miramar Grove with my boxing class,

03:16.791 --> 03:19.225
but then that means spending
two days in the woods

03:19.260 --> 03:21.460
with Bald Eagle, but if I say no,

03:21.495 --> 03:23.562
then it means that the douchebag wins,

03:23.598 --> 03:25.197
which pisses me off even more.

03:25.233 --> 03:26.665
Go.

03:26.701 --> 03:29.668
Tell Bald Eagle how you feel
in a non-punching manner.

03:29.704 --> 03:31.648
I mean, isn't that what
meditative boxing is all about?

03:31.672 --> 03:33.239
Okay, I gotta jam, ladies.

03:33.274 --> 03:35.674
I have a battle of my own
this morning with Albert.

03:35.710 --> 03:37.243
Speaking of irredeemable a-holes.

03:37.278 --> 03:38.577
Ugh, I hope not.

03:38.613 --> 03:40.357
I have to convince him
to let the firm partner

03:40.381 --> 03:41.513
on my class action.

03:41.549 --> 03:42.826
It's too big a case for Legal Aid.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.350
We need the big guns to win.

03:44.385 --> 03:46.004
Go Delia.

03:46.587 --> 03:48.020
Fighting the One Percent in Prada.

03:48.055 --> 03:50.027
- [cell phone beeps]
- Yeah, well, I embrace irony.

03:50.424 --> 03:51.683
- Ciao.
- Buh-bye.

03:51.708 --> 03:53.692
- Bye, hon.
- Okay, so Lilly just texted me

03:53.728 --> 03:55.261
and told me she's joining Chess Club.

03:55.296 --> 03:57.296
Do we believe we believe or is that code

03:57.331 --> 03:58.542
for wanting to be naughty
under the bleachers?

03:58.566 --> 03:59.943
Which is... yeah. [scoffs, chuckles]

03:59.967 --> 04:02.568
Okay, you know what? Stop
monitoring her movements,

04:02.603 --> 04:04.737
and find a way to talk to her.

04:04.772 --> 04:07.339
About things she wants to hear.

04:07.375 --> 04:09.942
- Such as?
- Offer to take her to the gyno.

04:09.977 --> 04:12.511
- [gasps]
- Remember the terrifying

04:12.546 --> 04:14.024
German gyno that Phoebe used to go to?

04:14.048 --> 04:15.714
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.716
One visit to that doctor
and Lilly's gonna be

04:17.752 --> 04:20.351
- checking herself into a nunnery.
- Yeah.

04:20.387 --> 04:22.721
That's the kind of
sex-positive feminist advice

04:22.757 --> 04:24.957
you can expect more of from Lady Parts.

04:24.992 --> 04:26.803
That'd be a really good
excuse to call Phoebe.

04:27.128 --> 04:29.828
No, I'm just gonna take
her to my own gynecologist,

04:29.864 --> 04:32.364
and we should probably
still give Phoebe some space.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.366
She kind of reminds
me of a cat I once had.

04:34.402 --> 04:36.602
Can't chase her down.
Gotta let her come to you.

04:37.445 --> 04:40.159
- [sighs]
- [exhales]

04:41.042 --> 04:43.409
So perfect.

04:43.444 --> 04:44.843
It's not an Eco-crime, right?

04:44.879 --> 04:48.647
Sustainable-organic from
the Pampas of Argentina.

04:48.683 --> 04:51.317
It's gonna look savage in my living room

04:51.352 --> 04:53.485
if those guys ever get
done refinishing the floors.

04:53.521 --> 04:56.388
Hey, thank you for
keeping all this stuff here

04:56.424 --> 04:58.869
and not whinging that I'm using
your house like a storage unit.

04:58.893 --> 05:00.726
Oh, yeah, no whinge. It's fine.

05:00.761 --> 05:02.761
Oh, my God, you got everything.

05:02.797 --> 05:05.397
Even the suit of armor.
Phoebe, you're magic.

05:05.433 --> 05:07.733
You said Punk Medici. I
didn't want to disappoint.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.327
- [chuckles]
- What?

05:09.352 --> 05:10.869
What is so funny?

05:10.905 --> 05:13.305
- Okay, so what if...
- Mm-hmm.

05:13.341 --> 05:15.941
Sir Cocksalot enters the castle

05:15.976 --> 05:17.576
with his dick in his hands?

05:17.611 --> 05:18.911
- [chuckles]
- Right?

05:18.946 --> 05:20.412
We take out the sword,

05:20.448 --> 05:23.304
and we replace it with a giant dildo.

05:23.329 --> 05:24.883
That's punk.

05:25.028 --> 05:27.281
That would definitely
put a twist on things.

05:27.454 --> 05:30.489
Gentle Phoebe, I task you with finding

05:30.524 --> 05:33.274
the biggest dildo in all the land.

05:33.627 --> 05:35.060
- Seriously?
- Yes.

05:35.096 --> 05:37.040
I think dick shopping is
stretching the definition

05:37.064 --> 05:39.832
- of cultural attaché.
- Trust, girliegirl.

05:39.867 --> 05:41.767
We're realizing an artistic vision here.

05:41.802 --> 05:44.436
We're gonna commission
a major work of art.

05:44.472 --> 05:47.506
A ceiling fresco.
- Of what?

05:47.541 --> 05:48.941
- See it.
- Mm-Kay.

05:48.976 --> 05:53.412
Me, Dragon Priestess. All
scales and wings and fire,

05:53.447 --> 05:57.341
looking out over a
decadent Middle Earth orgy.

05:57.864 --> 05:59.418
That is trippy.

05:59.453 --> 06:01.263
Only we need to find the right artist.

06:01.956 --> 06:04.591
Richard Prince or maybe John Currin.

06:04.992 --> 06:06.458
I have a juicier idea.

06:06.994 --> 06:09.560
- Your ex.
- JD?

06:09.930 --> 06:12.109
He's not technically my ex.
We're just taking a breather.

06:12.133 --> 06:14.633
But it's wearing on you.
I can see it more and more

06:14.668 --> 06:16.402
- in that frowny face.
- Really?

06:16.436 --> 06:17.813
I thought I... No,
no, that's just because

06:17.838 --> 06:19.505
you and I are connected.

06:19.540 --> 06:20.751
So when you're sad, it makes me sad.

06:20.775 --> 06:22.441
For, like, two months, wench.

06:22.476 --> 06:23.776
The limbo is killing you.

06:23.811 --> 06:25.043
- And me.
- I know,

06:25.079 --> 06:26.712
I just haven't seen or spoken to him

06:26.747 --> 06:28.762
since the whole cabin debacle,

06:29.081 --> 06:31.348
and I don't know how open
he's gonna be to seeing me.

06:31.485 --> 06:33.163
Well, this isn't about
hanging with my posse.

06:33.187 --> 06:34.853
This is about a real job,

06:34.889 --> 06:36.793
which is good for him and for you.

06:37.057 --> 06:39.355
Are you really sending me to see JD?

06:39.727 --> 06:41.285
You're my girl, P.

06:41.608 --> 06:43.534
I want you to get your happy back.

06:43.864 --> 06:45.397
Yeah.

06:45.433 --> 06:47.800
[indistinct chatter]

06:47.835 --> 06:50.548
Good Lord. Are you
still debating biscotti?

06:50.971 --> 06:52.181
No, I'm good.

06:52.873 --> 06:54.181
Are you sure?

06:54.742 --> 06:57.486
- Kimmy, wrap it up.
- McCarthy, check this out.

06:57.511 --> 07:00.145
- What?
- It is a media request

07:00.181 --> 07:02.881
for Lady Parts from KRWW

07:02.917 --> 07:05.417
to appear on their
"Buzzworthy" segment tomorrow.

07:05.453 --> 07:09.323
Ooh, "Buzzworthy," I love that.

07:09.683 --> 07:11.423
Wow. Where's KRWW?

07:11.459 --> 07:12.524
San Luis Obispo.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.793
Oh, no, that's a drive.

07:14.829 --> 07:18.096
Hey, snobby. It's TV exposure.

07:18.132 --> 07:20.632
I know, but tomorrow is
Lilly's gyno appointment.

07:20.668 --> 07:23.068
The most important doctor's appointment

07:23.103 --> 07:25.037
of her entire life,

07:25.259 --> 07:28.056
and I can't miss it just
so Mommy can be on TV.

07:28.442 --> 07:29.408
True.

07:29.433 --> 07:32.243
But... the station'll
just find someone else.

07:34.783 --> 07:36.500
Why don't you do it solo?

07:36.525 --> 07:38.828
Me? Uh, reminder,

07:38.853 --> 07:41.520
you're the face and TV virgin here.

07:41.555 --> 07:42.921
Yeah, but we're partners.

07:42.957 --> 07:46.458
You know, we need to share
the load and the glory.

07:46.494 --> 07:48.594
We can pop your TV cherry.

07:48.629 --> 07:51.563
It'll be amazing. I
can hire a media coach.

07:51.599 --> 07:54.600
I know a really good one.
She's pricey, but good.

07:54.635 --> 07:57.135
You're sweet, but it's
not worth the money.

07:57.171 --> 07:59.855
I'm just nervous. That's all.

08:00.174 --> 08:02.503
Okay, well, what are you gonna wear?

08:03.177 --> 08:05.043
Uh, my clothes?

08:05.079 --> 08:06.512
We can go shopping?

08:06.547 --> 08:09.781
[inhales sharply] That
would be so much fun.

08:09.817 --> 08:10.916
I will ta...

08:10.951 --> 08:12.316
Okay, I'll stop.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.621
- You got this.
- Uh-huh.

08:15.656 --> 08:18.273
Kimmy, hold. Let's use the biscotti.

08:19.994 --> 08:24.062
No, I think we rescheduled it
for... oh, tomorrow, I believe.

08:24.098 --> 08:25.597
Yes, that's true. They did.

08:25.633 --> 08:27.766
- [exhaling sharply]
- [door opens]

08:27.801 --> 08:30.135
- Albert, I need a minute.
- Can it wait?

08:30.170 --> 08:32.015
I'm trying to get out of
town for a couple of days.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.639
No. No, we have a situation,

08:33.674 --> 08:36.001
and you can't worm your way out of this.

08:36.361 --> 08:38.710
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna round up a list

08:38.746 --> 08:40.546
of 25 plaintiffs,

08:40.581 --> 08:42.025
I'm gonna build a class action lawsuit

08:42.049 --> 08:43.782
against Christede Holdings,

08:43.817 --> 08:46.785
and I'm gonna kick their ass
to the tune of $15 million

08:46.820 --> 08:48.604
with our firm as full partner.

08:48.889 --> 08:52.024
This is about partnering
in your Legal Aid lawsuit?

08:52.059 --> 08:53.959
- [laughs]
- Don't you dare laugh.

08:53.994 --> 08:57.563
Albert, these slumlord scumbags

08:57.598 --> 09:00.098
have broken every tenant
code in California,

09:00.134 --> 09:01.745
and, ultimately, it's
gonna make us more money

09:01.769 --> 09:03.146
than any divorce case I could bring in.

09:03.170 --> 09:05.137
I'm sorry. I was just surprised.

09:05.172 --> 09:06.413
Yes.

09:06.907 --> 09:09.541
- Yes, what?
- Yes, run with it.

09:09.577 --> 09:11.677
- Okay, what's the catch?
- No catch.

09:11.712 --> 09:12.916
Whatever you need.

09:13.547 --> 09:14.908
Thank you.

09:15.950 --> 09:18.717
Can I just say I think
this divorce has been

09:18.752 --> 09:21.587
really good for you. I
mean, you're like a new man.

09:21.622 --> 09:22.721
- Me?
- Yeah.

09:22.756 --> 09:24.189
You're the one who's changed.

09:24.224 --> 09:26.158
This Legal Aid thing,
it is very impressive.

09:26.193 --> 09:27.726
- Oh.
- You should have your own

09:27.761 --> 09:29.761
- social action action figure.
- Oh...

09:29.797 --> 09:31.663
[both laugh]

09:31.699 --> 09:33.973
Well, thank you.

09:34.603 --> 09:36.403
- Hey, where you going?
- Me?

09:36.604 --> 09:38.879
Oh, yeah, uh...

09:39.306 --> 09:40.906
surf camp. La Jolla.

09:40.941 --> 09:42.986
Getting out of the city
helps me keep my perspective.

09:43.010 --> 09:45.677
Uh-huh, okay.

09:45.713 --> 09:47.689
Well, whatever it is, keep doing it

09:47.874 --> 09:50.174
'cause, you know, it's working.

09:50.351 --> 09:53.919
[soft music]

09:53.954 --> 09:55.345
[sighs]

09:56.604 --> 09:58.977
Any heartburn? Hemorrhoids?

09:59.002 --> 10:00.736
Oh, look at that.

10:01.132 --> 10:03.565
That looks very informative.

10:03.908 --> 10:07.002
Sex with one partner
can still be group sex.

10:07.227 --> 10:08.455
What does that even mean?

10:08.479 --> 10:10.546
That means HPV

10:10.581 --> 10:13.649
and all the other types
of STDs you can catch

10:13.684 --> 10:15.784
without even knowing it. There you go.

10:15.820 --> 10:19.054
- Mom, c...
- "Chlamydia, gonorrhea... "

10:19.090 --> 10:21.290
Mom, you're making me
really uncomfortable.

10:21.325 --> 10:23.292
No, uncomfortable is you
coming home and saying,

10:23.327 --> 10:26.228
"Mom, what's this weird
blue bump inside my labia?"

10:26.264 --> 10:28.129
Abby, stop talking.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.579
Okay.

10:32.305 --> 10:34.470
- Lilly Novak?
- Right here.

10:34.505 --> 10:36.772
- Okay, take that.
- No.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.376
- Take it.
- No.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.039
[upbeat music]

10:42.380 --> 10:44.180
Yeah, here. Turn around like this.

10:44.215 --> 10:45.359
- Be careful with that one.
- I'll help you with that.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.515
[sighs]

10:46.551 --> 10:50.186
[indistinct chatter]

10:50.221 --> 10:52.321
Hey. How's it going?

10:52.356 --> 10:54.256
Good, good. Just looking forward to

10:54.292 --> 10:55.836
a weekend of getting
high off mountain air.

10:55.860 --> 10:57.426
- Yeah, me too.
- Mm-hmm, yeah,

10:57.461 --> 10:58.694
because it's so much better

10:58.729 --> 11:00.474
than all that pissed
off pollution in my head

11:00.498 --> 11:02.598
since you ran off after sex.

11:02.633 --> 11:05.100
- I panicked.
- Mm-hmm.

11:05.136 --> 11:06.713
I haven't been with anyone since my ex.

11:06.737 --> 11:09.071
Oh, my God, just spare me all that.

11:09.106 --> 11:10.739
"I can't trust again" divorce bullshit.

11:10.775 --> 11:12.341
I liked you, you douchebag.

11:12.502 --> 11:14.476
You seemed like someone
that could actually

11:14.512 --> 11:16.033
stand up to me.

11:16.514 --> 11:18.291
Tell me the real reason why you left.

11:18.683 --> 11:20.149
Hit me with it. I can take it.

11:20.184 --> 11:21.869
Come on. Come on.

11:23.221 --> 11:24.620
[bell dings]

11:24.655 --> 11:29.158
And let's get ready to circle!

11:29.193 --> 11:30.926
Saved by the bell, pussy.

11:35.266 --> 11:38.225
So, for the next 48 hours,

11:38.369 --> 11:42.014
we will engage in the
ultimate inner battle.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.139
'Cause our real fight

11:44.175 --> 11:46.700
is with the demons within, right?

11:47.778 --> 11:49.520
And in order to hear them,

11:50.281 --> 11:52.208
we need quiet.

11:52.717 --> 11:56.485
That's why you're all gonna
spend the next two days

11:56.520 --> 11:59.051
in total silence.

12:00.424 --> 12:01.790
What do you mean "silence"?

12:01.826 --> 12:03.692
No talking, Puma.

12:03.728 --> 12:05.427
I know it's your drug of choice,

12:05.463 --> 12:07.158
but when I ring this bell,

12:07.498 --> 12:09.244
there will be just listening.

12:09.533 --> 12:11.533
- You've gotta be kidding me.

12:38.362 --> 12:39.828
Thanks.

[sighs]

How are you?

12:46.570 --> 12:47.736
- Good.
- Yeah.

12:47.772 --> 12:49.204
I'm fine. I'm good.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.484
Uh, can you get you something to drink?

12:50.508 --> 12:52.708
Uh, no, I'm fine. Thanks.

12:52.743 --> 12:55.344
It's not the glamor
digs you're used to.

12:55.379 --> 12:56.512
It's transitional.

12:56.547 --> 12:58.259
I'm working on something permanent.

12:59.483 --> 13:01.298
That's nice. It's...

13:01.652 --> 13:03.819
a real artists atelier.

13:03.854 --> 13:05.064
Mm.

13:05.890 --> 13:07.470
Well, you've been working a lot.

13:07.758 --> 13:10.103
Yeah, pretty much all the time.

13:10.761 --> 13:12.204
So...

13:12.569 --> 13:14.302
what did you wanna talk about?

13:14.432 --> 13:16.198
Yeah, I wanted to...

13:16.233 --> 13:19.063
I wanted to discuss an idea that...

13:21.706 --> 13:23.672
- This is so weird.
- What?

13:23.708 --> 13:25.438
I don't know, its just so formal.

13:25.743 --> 13:28.048
I mean, you're standing there
and we're not... I don't know.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.881
I am having trouble forming the words.

13:32.917 --> 13:34.518

- Barbara Sawyer?
- That's me.

14:00.277 --> 14:02.611
Hi. So I have visual to cue up

14:02.646 --> 14:03.957
and for the graphics, I
think we can probably...

14:03.981 --> 14:05.533
I'm not your producer.

14:05.850 --> 14:08.784
- I'm your media coach.
- What media coach?

14:08.819 --> 14:10.953
Abby McCarthy hired me to
come down to the station

14:10.988 --> 14:15.290
- to work with you.
- Oh, well, that was thoughtful,

14:15.326 --> 14:17.760
but I'm not sure we're gonna have time

14:17.795 --> 14:19.428
because we have to
do my hair and makeup,

14:19.463 --> 14:20.807
and that's gonna take a little while.

14:20.831 --> 14:22.564
You're a gesticulator.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.334
That's not a problem. We
can clean that up right away.

14:25.369 --> 14:27.436
Don't worry. I work
with people in that chair

14:27.471 --> 14:28.521
all the time.

14:30.574 --> 14:34.676
So, Lilly, you're considering
becoming sexually active.

14:34.712 --> 14:35.911
- Yes.
- In the future.

14:35.946 --> 14:37.813
Not yet. We're just getting prepared.

14:37.848 --> 14:39.748
You know, it's like buying gas masks

14:39.784 --> 14:41.794
in case of a deadly sarin attack.

14:45.656 --> 14:47.840
So... you've got a boyfriend?

14:48.426 --> 14:49.491
- Yes.
- [cell phone buzzing]

14:49.527 --> 14:51.593
And, uh, is he a junior also?

14:51.629 --> 14:53.824

- Oh.

Uh, he works at a bakery
that my mom's friend...

I'm so sorry. I just have to take this.

15:01.806 --> 15:04.273
It's gonna be quick.
[chuckles nervously]

15:04.308 --> 15:07.276
- [line trilling]
- You got this.

15:07.311 --> 15:08.977
- Okay.
- Hey, Barb.

15:09.013 --> 15:11.447
- Are you still at the studio?
- Yeah, I'm here

15:11.482 --> 15:13.982
with the media consultant you hired.

15:14.018 --> 15:16.952
Oh, yay. Surprise. Isn't she nice?

15:16.987 --> 15:18.821
I wish you would have
consulted me first.

15:18.856 --> 15:20.489
I told you I didn't want to do that.

15:20.524 --> 15:21.902
No, you said you didn't
want to pay for it,

15:21.926 --> 15:23.091
so I'm paying for it myself.

15:23.127 --> 15:24.726
You are gonna crush it, Babs.

15:24.762 --> 15:26.762
Just let Brooke help you crush it.

15:30.468 --> 15:31.778
Really have to get back inside there

15:31.802 --> 15:33.936
because Dr. Beaver over there

15:33.971 --> 15:37.105
is about to get Lilly a
summer job at a brothel.

15:37.141 --> 15:39.608
I'm going to call you
when it's done, okay.

15:39.643 --> 15:41.710
- Good luck.

15:41.745 --> 15:43.679
There are just so many
birth control options.

15:43.714 --> 15:45.514
Have you and your
partner discussed any...

15:45.549 --> 15:47.483
"Partner." Yeah, well,

15:47.518 --> 15:49.418
that's a little bit of an overstatement.

15:49.831 --> 15:52.026
They're not gay dads. They're dating.

15:52.623 --> 15:54.690
My boyfriend mentioned the chip.

15:54.725 --> 15:55.869
He said it lasts for a while.

15:55.893 --> 15:57.559
Oh, the chip is a great option.

15:57.595 --> 15:59.962
- It releases progestin, which...
- Okay, uh, no.

15:59.997 --> 16:01.964
She's not getting the chip.

16:01.999 --> 16:04.566
It's, like, "totally safe"
today and then three years later,

16:04.602 --> 16:07.574
recalled. Oops, she's infertile.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.152
Skip. Next.

There's always the pill.

16:13.377 --> 16:15.544
I worry I wouldn't
remember it every day.

16:15.579 --> 16:17.579
Exactly. I mean, what about the whole

16:17.615 --> 16:19.299
HPV epidemic?

16:19.324 --> 16:20.682
Shouldn't we be talking about that?

16:20.718 --> 16:23.752
It's true, none of the
controls that we are considering

16:23.787 --> 16:25.776
will prevent STDs.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.624
[playful music]

16:28.659 --> 16:30.494

gonna be a few minutes

16:52.359 --> 16:54.492

downtown and collect names.

Well, let me save you some grunt work.

16:56.230 --> 16:57.421
How's that?

16:57.931 --> 17:00.176
My firm committed to partner
with us on the Christede case.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.368

17:06.940 --> 17:08.651
Okay, this is the part
where you wanna hug me

17:08.675 --> 17:11.108
but you high-five me instead.
What... why aren't you excited?

17:11.144 --> 17:12.978
Because I don't wanna
bring in a big firm.

17:13.012 --> 17:15.247
- It's our case.
- Yeah, it's still our case.

17:15.281 --> 17:16.526
I'm just bringing the big guns in

17:16.550 --> 17:18.116
to help beat their legal team.

17:18.151 --> 17:20.151
But if we bring in a big firm,

17:20.186 --> 17:21.431
the best we can hope
for is a settlement.

17:21.454 --> 17:23.021
Yeah, a really big, juicy settlement.

17:23.056 --> 17:24.321
What's wrong with that?

17:24.358 --> 17:25.991
Because I wanna take this to trial.

17:26.026 --> 17:28.326
If we settle, then
Christede can buy his way out

17:28.362 --> 17:29.639
like he's paying a parking ticket.

17:29.663 --> 17:32.230
Yes, a really big,
expensive parking ticket

17:32.266 --> 17:34.277
that could help a lot of people.

17:34.501 --> 17:36.468
Hey, why are you pushing back on this?

17:36.503 --> 17:39.004
A case like this launches careers.

17:41.642 --> 17:44.009
What are you talking about?

17:44.044 --> 17:46.211
There's a seat coming
up in City Council.

17:46.246 --> 17:48.313
- Gracias.
- Is that what this is about?

17:48.348 --> 17:50.215
Your career in politics?

17:50.250 --> 17:52.284
What, like you don't have
any skin in this game?

17:52.319 --> 17:54.252
Last I checked, you
were a partner at Wilcox,

17:54.288 --> 17:57.022
which means, if we settle,
you get a two-comma payday.

17:57.057 --> 17:59.424
Our clients could really use that money.

17:59.459 --> 18:01.004
