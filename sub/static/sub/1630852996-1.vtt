in San Francisco, California,
nine o'clock a.m. on July 11th, 2017.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.892
Ms. Holmes,
please raise your right hand.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.813
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

00:22.313 --> 00:23.356
I do.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.359
This is an investigation
of Theranos Inc. SF

00:26.484 --> 00:28.528
to determine whether
there have been violations

00:28.611 --> 00:30.613
for certain provisions
of Federal Security laws.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.699
Any reason why you can't give
full, complete

00:32.782 --> 00:34.117
and truthful testimony today?

00:37.662 --> 00:39.039
INTERVIEWER:
<i>Can you say the company name?</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:42.459
- Theranos.
- I thought it was Therah-nos.

00:42.542 --> 00:46.296
No, Theranos. It's a mix between "therapy"
and "diagnosis".

00:46.546 --> 00:48.548
Why not Theranosis?

00:48.673 --> 00:51.968
Because the name is Theranos.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.929
Actually, can we cut that part?
About the name?

00:56.264 --> 01:01.686
So, currently, we have 500 employees.
We are valued at nine billion dollars.

01:02.062 --> 01:02.979
<i>Wow.</i>

01:03.146 --> 01:08.068
We offer 200 of the most commonly ordered
blood tests. And the best part is...

01:08.234 --> 01:11.780
<i>"We don't use a syringe</i>
<i>for any of it." Then you go on to say,</i>

01:11.863 --> 01:14.866
<i>"We can run 70 tests</i>
<i>on a single drop of blood."</i>

01:15.116 --> 01:17.410
<i>Would you characterize those claims</i>
<i>as truthful?</i>

01:18.203 --> 01:19.996
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Some rapid-fire questions.</i>

01:20.205 --> 01:21.372

early decision at Stanford, huh?

First step is... Stanford.
And then I'm gonna graduate.

And I plan on inventing a product
and start a company.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.928
Well, I may know a little something
about that.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.555
Richard's company has hundreds
of medical patents.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.766
-Mm-hmm.
- He could give you some advice.

06:31.933 --> 06:36.646
But don't you just file patents
so companies have to pay you off? Right?

06:36.813 --> 06:40.441
No. No, that is not
what Richard does at all.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.068
I wouldn't put it that way.

No. I mean, yes, use condoms
But...

-Excuse me.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.874

When you travel, a nice man

11:56.465 --> 12:01.429

My, God. Speak English.

Yeah, I don't know what you're saying.
I'm not good at this.

15:41.732 --> 15:45.694
You don't need the "Sh."
It... It translates to,

15:45.861 --> 15:47.154
"You very impressive."

15:47.738 --> 15:50.783
So, you go from the noun straight
to the degree adverb.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.202
Oh.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.287
Are you an administrator here?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.665
Why, because I'm old?

15:58.374 --> 16:00.250
Yes. It's a college program.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.933
Do you have a job or something?

16:16.100 --> 16:20.562
No. I started a software company
and sold it for 40 million dollars.

16:25.567 --> 16:29.363
You're not supposed to open the lid
all the way. It's not going to cook.

Let me just...
Let me grab my money belt.

17:04.606 --> 17:05.983
Are you a Muslim?

17:06.358 --> 17:09.945
I'm Hindu. That's why my family
had to leave Pakistan and move to India.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.448
Then I got the fuck out of there
and moved to California.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.324
Do you miss your home?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.745
I don't know what my home is.
When we left Pakistan,

17:17.870 --> 17:19.705
we had to leave our house,
we had to leave everything.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.874
And after that...

17:23.375 --> 17:25.252
I wanted to go
to the States for college.

17:25.627 --> 17:30.632
This was in 1986.
How old were you in '86?

17:31.008 --> 17:33.677
- Uh, I was two.
- Jesus.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.680
Try some of my scorpion.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.267
- No, thank you.
- It's crunchy.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.435
No way.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.066
- Go on. Take a bite.
- I don't wanna take a bite.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.567
Do it.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.578
-It's not funny.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.502
You can go.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.003
I want to stay here...

18:09.713 --> 18:10.964
till I know you're safe.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.039
- I can't.
- You can't hear how that's wrong?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.050
You know what?
You're not trying hard enough.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.135
It's not that hard.

18:56.301 --> 18:59.138
That's why I think I wanna focus
on the biomedical industry.

18:59.346 --> 19:03.433
Because... I wanna help people...
and I wanna be a billionaire.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.436
- Like Steve Jobs.
- You know what you want.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.105
I do.

19:09.857 --> 19:10.983
Thank you.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.568
For what?

19:13.777 --> 19:14.778
Not laughing.

19:17.197 --> 19:20.701
My dad comes from an incredible family
of inventors and businessmen.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.871
He just wants me to live up
to my potential.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.248
What about your parents?

19:27.082 --> 19:28.542
My mother's in India.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.837
My dad died a couple of years ago.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.422
Oh...

19:34.006 --> 19:36.258
I'm so sorry. How?

19:38.218 --> 19:39.887
I don't want to talk about it. ...

19:42.681 --> 19:44.016
Would you like to dance?

19:53.567 --> 19:54.943
This doesn't feel right.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.032
- We can just...
- Yeah.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.256
Sunset is beautiful.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.677
It's the air pollution.

20:34.149 --> 20:37.819
You know what this has...
meant to me, yeah?

20:38.862 --> 20:40.155
This whole month has been...

20:40.239 --> 20:42.199
Yeah, but we don't have
to say goodbye.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.077
Because I'm gonna be in Palo Alto
in August.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.787
And then we'll live in the same city.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.166
What time do you have to leave
for India tomorrow?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.459
Early.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.921
My mother has arranged
this whole dinner thing.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.136
Can I ask you something?

21:04.554 --> 21:05.931
How did your dad die?

21:06.431 --> 21:07.557
You never told me.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.853
He went to the hospital with chest pains.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.107
And the idiot doctor

21:15.232 --> 21:17.651
ordered a bunch of tests
but they were the wrong tests.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.196
He said it was just stress
and sent him home.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.285
And then that night, he died...

21:27.536 --> 21:28.787
of a heart attack.

21:32.457 --> 21:36.670
Completely fucking preventable
and I think about it every single day!

21:48.348 --> 21:49.599
I don't know, I'm...

21:51.601 --> 21:53.228
I get angry sometimes.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.359
Give me your wallet.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.584
It's custom in China to...

22:16.960 --> 22:18.337
burn the things that you'd want

22:18.503 --> 22:19.921
the dead to have in the afterlife.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.430
For your dad.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.032
I don't want to burn
this fucking building down.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.298
I should get to bed.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.513
Have a good freshman year.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.193
Yeah.

23:26.655 --> 23:30.117
<i>...Don't mind</i>
<i>Just wanna rock you girl</i>

23:31.618 --> 23:32.661
Yeah.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.871
<i>Give it a whirl</i>

23:35.038 --> 23:37.457
Oh, shit, your shower-caddy.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.293
It's okay. Don't worry.

23:41.795 --> 23:42.796
There it is.

23:43.922 --> 23:44.840
<i>Girl</i>

23:44.965 --> 23:46.299
Because it's beautiful.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.677
<i>SUNNY: </i>
<i>Microfluidics is beautiful? How?</i>

23:48.885 --> 23:50.262
Microfluidics is...

23:51.388 --> 23:52.764
Okay, imagine printer ink.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.309
So, your printer has one base color
to start

23:56.393 --> 23:58.520
<i>and then it goes through,</i>
<i>say, three different channels</i>

23:58.645 --> 24:01.523
and that reaches
three different destinations,

24:01.648 --> 24:05.777
and each of those has a different reactive
that give you a different color.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.696
<i>So, you want</i>
<i>to make ink cartridges.</i>

24:07.779 --> 24:08.697
No.

24:08.905 --> 24:12.367
I'm kidding. By the way,
I'm sorry we didn't talk yesterday.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.703
I was moving into my new place.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.248
Hey, do you like beer?

24:19.541 --> 24:20.584
'Cause I really like it.

24:21.084 --> 24:24.588
Ah! So you like Microfluidics and beer.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.507
- Sunny.
-<i>Yeah?</i>

24:29.676 --> 24:31.136
I really love it here.

25:00.165 --> 25:03.877
<i>I'm not a software engineer,</i>
<i>I'm a physician and a scientist.</i>

25:03.960 --> 25:09.716
But, I do think that technology
can have an enormous impact

25:09.841 --> 25:11.343
on the health care industry.

25:11.426 --> 25:14.513
And I... I do think that
we're just starting to understand

25:14.638 --> 25:18.225
the impact that technology can have
on all parts of our life.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.351
Amazing.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.561
- So, you are a doctor?
-Yes.

25:21.728 --> 25:24.064
And inventor, and investor.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.608
- You've served on boards of companies.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.361
I mean, why are you also a professor?

25:29.903 --> 25:34.991
Because, honestly, Standford is
the most exciting place to be right now.

25:35.075 --> 25:40.163
And it's 2002, so just imagine
what tech is gonna be able to do in 2022,

25:40.330 --> 25:44.834
and it's gonna be up to you guys.
What are they calling you these days?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.920
- The Millennials?

25:47.045 --> 25:50.006
You grew up with computers,
you're not scared of what they can do,

25:50.173 --> 25:53.635
but you still have to remember,
there's a lot that we don't know

25:53.718 --> 25:57.681
and you... you are the ones
who are gonna find out.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.359
- Professor Robertson?
- Oh, god, it's you.

26:09.442 --> 26:12.195
No, no, I can't let you in.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.490
It is a graduate level
research group

26:15.657 --> 26:16.700
and you are a freshmen?

26:16.783 --> 26:18.201
- Right. I know.
- So you're not ready.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.496
- I know, but I... I was thinking that...
- Why do want to be in a graduate group?

26:21.580 --> 26:25.125
Just be a freshman, just run around
and... get drunk

26:25.208 --> 26:27.711
and break some hearts, and...
sleep with your boyfriend.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.379
Well, I broke up with my boyfriend
this morning

26:29.462 --> 26:31.381
- 'cause he's too much of a distraction.
- How did that go?

26:31.548 --> 26:32.799
- Pretty good.
- Pretty good, huh?

26:32.924 --> 26:36.344
You need to change the flow rate,
that's why your experiment's not working.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.431
- Wait, what?
- You need to change the flow rate.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.809
How do you know
what we're working on here?

26:44.269 --> 26:46.229
Because my TA Rakesh let me
look at his notes.

26:46.354 --> 26:48.148
He's a Cubs fan, I bought him a hat.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.568
Come on.

27:19.512 --> 27:20.764
CHANNING:
It's over here.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.684
Where are we on the flow rate?

27:24.893 --> 27:27.145
- What's up, dude?
- Hey, what's up?

27:27.854 --> 27:30.815
It's not the flow rate, I tried that.
We think maybe changing

27:30.899 --> 27:32.525
the viscosity a little bit might...

27:32.692 --> 27:34.402
You... Um, you...

27:34.819 --> 27:38.531
you did, you sped up
the flow rate but in order to...

27:38.657 --> 27:42.577
to... to maintain the average
linear velocity you... you need

27:42.702 --> 27:45.747
to also increase the dimension
of the five outlet channels.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.295
- That's not true. I personally tried...
- Yes, it is.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.220
Yes, it is.

28:02.430 --> 28:03.348
Mm-hmm.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.558
She's one of my freshmen.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.061
Fuck, you're a freshman.

28:10.855 --> 28:11.981
You're in.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.027
- Could you get her lab coat?
- Nice.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.577
Channing said he would hear my ideas
for products

28:24.661 --> 28:26.454
and we're working on such
amazing technology.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.373
<i>That professor is in love with you.</i>

28:28.540 --> 28:29.999
No, he's not!

28:30.500 --> 28:33.545
Whatever.
Am I going to see you this summer?

28:34.879 --> 28:37.757
- See me?
- Yeah. See you.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.177
Uh...

28:41.761 --> 28:43.555
I don't know. What are you up to?

28:44.973 --> 28:45.974
I'm very busy.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.269
I'm going to be driving
around in my new Lamborghini.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.063
<i>Oh, you got a Lamborghini?</i>

28:52.564 --> 28:55.483
-<i>Yes, the most expensive one.</i>
- Why?

28:55.984 --> 28:57.736
<i>Because I can.</i>

28:59.195 --> 29:01.072
Because no one thinks
that you're a terrorist

29:01.239 --> 29:02.532
when you drive a Lamborghini.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.784
<i>- Motherfuckers.</i>

29:06.828 --> 29:08.329
CHANNING:
<i>So, you wrote this up this summer?</i>

29:08.705 --> 29:11.583
Yeah, I had a little too much downtime
at my internship.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.376
So, it's a... it's a patch.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.587
I see that.

29:16.045 --> 29:19.674
It's a wearable device
that administers a drug,

29:19.883 --> 29:20.967
just like an antibiotic...

29:21.176 --> 29:23.052
directly into the patient's bloodstream

29:23.303 --> 29:25.180
while simultaneously monitoring

29:25.346 --> 29:26.931
whether the medication is working.

29:27.640 --> 29:31.644
It's diagnosis and therapy
at the same time.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.688
Huh. Yeah.

29:34.689 --> 29:35.857
I wanna start a company,

29:37.192 --> 29:38.777
and I'd like you to be a founding member.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.237
- I don't wanna wait.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.364
David Filo and Jerry Yang

29:43.531 --> 29:47.243
started Yahoo while they were
in your program, you must have invested.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.205
Actually, they asked me and I said, "No."

29:51.247 --> 29:52.582
I wish I could take that one back.

29:55.543 --> 29:58.004
You know what? I'm gonna put you
in touch with a physician,

29:58.671 --> 30:02.383
talk about the viability of this.
Do you know... Phyllis Gardner?

30:19.317 --> 30:20.777
Channing Robertson sent you?

30:21.069 --> 30:23.029
Yes, I'm in his graduate research group

30:23.571 --> 30:25.240
as a... a sophomore.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.702
Um... It's never gonna work.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.914
A patch is too small to store full doses

30:33.122 --> 30:35.208
of a single drug,
let alone multiple drugs

30:35.416 --> 30:37.544
and the reagents needed
for long-term testing.

30:37.710 --> 30:41.256
But then even if it could,
it would have to provide long-term storage

30:41.756 --> 30:44.551
for those chemicals at body temperature.

30:44.634 --> 30:47.178
And let's just...
l... let's put all that aside.

30:47.512 --> 30:51.182
Let's... let's say that you were able
to work out a way to do any of that.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.853
If you think that people want a patch

30:55.436 --> 30:56.938
to diagnose them

30:57.105 --> 31:00.358
and then put medicine directly
into their skin,

31:00.775 --> 31:03.319
then you've never met
a sick person before.

31:04.571 --> 31:08.992
People go to school for a very long time
to understand how to diagnose patients.

31:09.325 --> 31:10.869
You can't get a diagnosis
from a patch

31:11.035 --> 31:12.787
because human beings aren't machines.

31:13.162 --> 31:15.081
But doctors make mistakes.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.167
And this would be
based on data, so...

31:18.293 --> 31:20.086
Well, data isn't everything.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.422
Um, people your age
need to remember

31:22.589 --> 31:26.342
that machines make mistakes too,
especially when humans are operating them.

31:26.759 --> 31:28.511
- Yeah, but...
- It's... it's fine.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.346
It's, uh, nothing personal.

31:30.513 --> 31:32.265
You had an idea.
It's not gonna work,

31:32.390 --> 31:34.475
so you just... you keep learning.

31:34.726 --> 31:35.685
Keep trying.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.732
I'm gonna be heading home
and very nice to meet you.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.738
"Do or do not. There is no try."

31:47.280 --> 31:48.156
What?

31:49.032 --> 31:51.492
That's Yoda from <i>Star Wars.</i>

31:53.077 --> 31:53.953
Oh.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.668
Professor Gardner!

32:01.961 --> 32:02.921
Wait, wait!

32:03.338 --> 32:06.341
I just think that...
I think that we can work together.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.635
- Work together?
- Yeah.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.803
You're... you're a... what?
Freshmen, sophomore?

32:11.054 --> 32:13.890
- I just started my sophomore year.
- So you've had a couple of classes,

32:13.973 --> 32:16.351
maybe a seminar or two,
and now you think you know enough

32:16.476 --> 32:17.477
to start a company?

32:18.519 --> 32:20.229
I just thought as... as a woman,
you...

32:20.396 --> 32:22.732
Well, as a woman,
let me explain something to you.

32:22.857 --> 32:25.109
You don't get to skip any steps.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.487
You have to do the work.

32:27.904 --> 32:31.407
Your work, other people's work.
You have to do so much work,

32:31.574 --> 32:33.785
that they have to admit that you did it.
Nobody helped you.

32:33.868 --> 32:37.622
You have to take away all their excuses.
And then if you get anything,

32:37.956 --> 32:41.376
anything wrong, they'll destroy you,
and they'll be so happy to do it,

32:41.542 --> 32:43.419
so no, as a woman,
I can't help you right now.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.088
And just...

32:45.755 --> 32:46.756
...one other thing.

32:46.923 --> 32:52.804
Don't ever quote Yoda
to anybody ever again. Science is trying.

32:53.638 --> 32:54.889
That's all that it is.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.433
You only get to really do something

32:57.558 --> 32:59.644
when you've been trying for so long
that doing

32:59.727 --> 33:02.855
doesn't even seem possible anymore.
So, science is real.

33:02.939 --> 33:06.985
Yoda is a fictional green character
who apparently knows everything

33:07.110 --> 33:11.280
in the universe, except for syntax
and grammar.

33:11.406 --> 33:14.951
So, I'm sorry, your idea's impossible,
but that's the way the world works.

33:15.201 --> 33:19.914
The world works in certain ways
until a great idea comes along

33:20.123 --> 33:22.166
and... and changes everything.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.752
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go, now.

33:24.919 --> 33:27.380
My husband is waiting for me
with a glass of red wine

33:27.547 --> 33:31.217
and a foot massage, and the DVD
of <i>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</i>

33:31.300 --> 33:35.096
which came in the mail today,
so I suggest you find a version

33:35.179 --> 33:36.973
of that for yourself.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.433
You're 19.

33:39.225 --> 33:41.519
You don't have to be anything else
right now.

33:58.494 --> 33:59.746
Bee-bo-bee-bo-beep.

34:00.955 --> 34:03.291
What do we have here?

34:04.584 --> 34:07.545
Oh. Oh, wow, that's alive. Yep.

34:09.756 --> 34:12.175
You are gonna come up with a new thing.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.720
Should I just stop? What should I do?

34:16.888 --> 34:20.224
Well, you could, I don't know,
like,

34:20.892 --> 34:23.352
try being a sophomore
in college for a night.

34:23.811 --> 34:24.771
That might be fun.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.564
You like acapella?

34:27.607 --> 34:30.735
You ever heard "Don't Stop Believin'"
in a 12-part harmony?

34:32.028 --> 34:33.112
It's fun.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.081
That's so funny!

34:47.668 --> 34:48.669
Hey!

34:51.589 --> 34:52.757
How are you guys?

34:53.758 --> 34:56.344
Oh, my God, that's hilarious.
Oh...

34:57.178 --> 34:58.805
Oh, my God, that's hilarious.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.057
That's the best joke ever.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.143
That's so funny. I'm having so much fun!

35:04.268 --> 35:05.353
Whoo-hoo.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.146
Whoo-hoo!

35:07.688 --> 35:08.856
Whoo-hoo!

35:09.357 --> 35:10.608
Whoo!

35:18.950 --> 35:21.035
<i>Ms. Holmes? Ms. Holmes?</i>

35:21.410 --> 35:22.745
Please answer the question.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.163
I...

35:25.164 --> 35:26.749
don't remember specifically.

35:27.750 --> 35:28.960
You were the CEO.

35:29.836 --> 35:30.795
Yes.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.339
<i>And you don't</i>
<i>remember specifically?</i>

35:33.422 --> 35:34.841
ELIZABETH:<i> I... I don't... um...</i>

35:36.175 --> 35:38.678
<i>no, I don't recall details from years ago.</i>

35:38.803 --> 35:40.054
<i>I... I... I...</i>

35:41.013 --> 35:42.056
<i>I don't recall...</i>

35:56.988 --> 35:58.364
MALE VOICE:<i> Ms. Holmes.</i>

36:01.909 --> 36:05.204
- Ms. Holmes, do you need a break?
- No.

36:10.793 --> 36:13.337
What's wrong with her?
Did something happen?

36:13.921 --> 36:17.049
At the party, I think a guy
did something to her.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.969
I don't know the whole story,
but she went to the police.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.763
- The police?
-She said it was rape.

36:22.972 --> 36:24.098
Really?

36:25.057 --> 36:26.142
Do you believe her?

36:26.517 --> 36:28.686
- I don't know. Let's go.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.247
Hello.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.999
<i>Hey, where have you been?</i>

36:50.166 --> 36:51.918
<i>I tried calling you for a few days.</i>

36:52.293 --> 36:53.377
I've been busy.

36:53.836 --> 36:57.173
I miss you. You know how much
I miss you when I don't talk to you.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.635
<i>Do you know how weird that is</i>
<i>that you would say that to me?</i>

37:01.761 --> 37:02.845
<i>I'm 19.</i>

37:04.847 --> 37:06.098
I'm 19.

37:08.392 --> 37:11.020
You should talk
to somebody your own age.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.147
<i>That's what you want?</i>

37:15.691 --> 37:16.651
Yeah.

37:17.610 --> 37:18.486
Yes.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.240
This is fucking weird.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.911
Don't call me again.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.736
MALE VOICE:
Ms. Holmes. They're ready for you.

38:16.419 --> 38:17.753
What did they say?

38:18.337 --> 38:20.589
They aren't recommending
any disciplinary action.

38:20.715 --> 38:21.632
I know that.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.552
But what did they say?

38:26.012 --> 38:27.471
It's my word against his.

38:29.598 --> 38:30.891
They don't believe me.

38:33.602 --> 38:35.229
I can't get anyone to believe me.

38:44.655 --> 38:47.616
I c... I can't get this smell out.
I think we should just throw it out.

38:49.368 --> 38:53.247
Oh, my God! Th... this is dangerous.
This could hurt you!

38:53.456 --> 38:54.707
We should get rid of it.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.045
I need your help.

39:01.380 --> 39:02.381
Elizabeth.

39:03.299 --> 39:04.717
- Get under it.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.010
- Yeah. Come on.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.636
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.013
Mom, I have to put it down,

39:09.096 --> 39:11.307
- I have to put it down. I have to.
- All right, all right.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.142
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.
Okay.

39:15.644 --> 39:18.147
- I don't want to do this right now, I...
-Elizabeth.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.523
No, just go back to the hotel.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.525
- I... leave me alone, I'm...
- I believe you

39:23.611 --> 39:25.946
I believe you.
I believe everything you said.

39:33.621 --> 39:36.374
But I... I didn't... you told me
to be careful, and I didn't listen to you,

39:36.540 --> 39:37.541
I was drinking.

39:38.709 --> 39:41.253
Men will... take...

39:42.671 --> 39:45.633
and... take from you,

39:46.467 --> 39:49.512
so you have to decide right now

39:50.096 --> 39:52.973
if you are going to let that stop you.

39:55.184 --> 39:56.644
- But how will...
- You just put it away,

39:57.103 --> 39:58.813
and forget it.

39:59.688 --> 40:00.731
And...

40:03.109 --> 40:04.276
then one day...

40:05.694 --> 40:07.655
one day, you'll just be fine again....

40:11.909 --> 40:14.120
Come on. This thing smells awful.

40:16.705 --> 40:18.749
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:19.542 --> 40:22.002
- And one, two,

40:22.920 --> 40:23.796
three!

40:24.213 --> 40:25.673
Oh, God!

40:37.601 --> 40:38.894
I love you.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.733
We should wash our hands.

42:27.628 --> 42:28.504
You're back.

42:28.879 --> 42:29.922
I'm back.

42:30.714 --> 42:31.632
It's a redesign.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.302
It's a box the size of an iPod.

42:36.428 --> 42:39.515
And it doesn't administer medicine.
It tests your blood.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.309
<i>What if you could test your blood</i>

42:43.018 --> 42:44.144
in your own home?

42:46.063 --> 42:47.982
And what if it's not a whole vial,

42:49.233 --> 42:50.401
<i>but just a drop?</i>

42:51.277 --> 42:52.278
It would always be with you.

42:54.947 --> 42:57.491
And it... it could keep you safe.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.582
So, Channing wants us to begin
the research phase as soon as possible.

43:46.832 --> 43:48.792
We're renting office space
in East Palo Alto.

43:48.959 --> 43:51.962
But isn't that the part of the city
they told you not to go to

43:52.046 --> 43:53.964
- during orientation?
- Yeah, that's dangerous.

43:54.089 --> 43:56.175
- Yeah.
- I got lost there during the move in,

43:56.300 --> 43:58.552
when you sent me to...
the Urban Outfitters.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.347
We can't afford anything else right now.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.183
And I wanted to ask you if...

44:04.850 --> 44:06.018
you would consider...

44:06.852 --> 44:09.730
investing my tuition money
into the company.

44:11.565 --> 44:13.317
Well, how would we pay
for your tuition?

44:13.442 --> 44:17.112
Well, you won't have to, because I'm...
I'm going to drop out.

44:18.072 --> 44:19.990
- You're gonna do what?
- No. No!

44:20.366 --> 44:22.660
Steve Jobs dropped out.
Bill Gates dropped out.

44:22.951 --> 44:25.245
Michael Dell, Paul Allen.
Elon Musk...

44:25.329 --> 44:27.206
- Who's Paul Allen?
- He's the other Microsoft guy.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.541
I don't care.
You're not dropping out of Stanford.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.126
Start a company after you graduate.

44:31.251 --> 44:33.379
No, I... I don't even go
to class anymore anyway.

44:33.629 --> 44:34.797
Wait, you don't go to class?

44:36.548 --> 44:38.634
Elizabeth, is this about
what happened?

44:38.759 --> 44:41.011
- Noel.
- No. No.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.776
What does this thing even do?
It...

44:57.152 --> 44:58.195
tests your blood?

44:58.362 --> 45:00.406
It's...

45:01.365 --> 45:04.535
Mom, you would never have
to have a needle ever again.

45:17.464 --> 45:18.924
I don't understand you.

45:21.552 --> 45:22.761
I know.

45:26.515 --> 45:29.893
Guess what?
Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford.

45:30.060 --> 45:32.604
And get this,
she invented a medical device,

45:32.813 --> 45:34.189
some sort of blood testing thing.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.650
A professor from Stanford
is helping her.

45:36.775 --> 45:38.402
They already raised a lot of money.

45:38.902 --> 45:41.029
- She didn't call for my advice.
- What do you mean?

45:41.572 --> 45:44.950
She's going to be doing
the exact same thing that I'm doing.

45:45.492 --> 45:46.785
She doesn't call me?

45:47.161 --> 45:50.122
She's a kid. She probably doesn't have
our phone number.

45:50.914 --> 45:51.999
No.

45:53.709 --> 45:56.962
'Cause they all think
they're better than us. That whole family.

45:57.713 --> 46:02.009
- Anyway, Mrs. Holmes said that...
- Why do you call her Mrs. Holmes?

46:02.092 --> 46:03.343
She calls you Lorraine.

46:04.386 --> 46:06.138
Why do you call her Mrs. Holmes?

46:06.805 --> 46:08.265
I never thought about it.

46:19.651 --> 46:23.030
- She should have called me.
- Don't make a big thing of it.

46:23.864 --> 46:25.032
I'm not.

46:27.326 --> 46:29.369
I just think
she should have called me.

47:11.203 --> 47:12.204
What happened?

47:13.914 --> 47:15.249
Was someone shooting at you?

47:16.208 --> 47:17.125
No.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.044
It was a stray bullet.

47:19.878 --> 47:21.338
There was a fight, I think.

47:23.507 --> 47:24.591
Thank you for coming.

47:29.012 --> 47:30.430
Why did you call me?

47:31.557 --> 47:33.225
You told me never to talk to you again.

47:39.147 --> 47:40.274
I don't know.

47:40.941 --> 47:42.734
Yes, you do! Why am I here?

47:45.237 --> 47:46.697
Why am I here?

48:01.795 --> 48:03.964
You can't push me away again.

48:06.300 --> 48:07.759
I'm going to protect you.

48:15.976 --> 48:18.270
I know. I know.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.188
<i>MALE VOICE:</i>
<i>Do you ever recall telling anyone,</i>

48:20.272 --> 48:22.399

48:40.751 --> 48:42.002
I knew that we made...

48:43.337 --> 48:44.713
so many mistakes,

48:44.838 --> 48:46.256
but we were...

48:47.174 --> 48:48.050
we were trying to...

48:48.175 --> 48:51.553
to take this forward,
and at that time,

48:52.387 --> 48:53.263
we thought

48:53.805 --> 48:55.349
that we were doing the right thing.
