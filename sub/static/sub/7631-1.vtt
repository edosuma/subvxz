01:26.434 --> 01:28.177
- Thanks a lot, man.
- You bet.

01:28.269 --> 01:30.095
- Cool. Take care.
- You, too.

01:34.024 --> 01:36.147
Harp, how's it goin', brother?

01:43.782 --> 01:47.364
Robin, baby, I got some good news.

01:47.452 --> 01:51.034
- Try this. Tell me what you think.
- Come on, girl. You know...

01:51.164 --> 01:55.540
Grilled ginger shrimp
with cranberry-orange-mango chutney.

01:55.627 --> 01:59.291
- Damn, that's good.
- Yeah, man, 'tis good.

02:04.175 --> 02:08.753
Thanks for letting me use your kitchen.
I almost died when my stove broke.

02:08.971 --> 02:10.631
No problem, baby.

02:10.847 --> 02:14.050
But then I remembered
what a loving boyfriend I have.

02:18.271 --> 02:19.848
Sorry about the mess.

02:20.106 --> 02:23.805
I have three jobs goin' on at once here.

02:24.359 --> 02:26.767
- It's so crazy.
- So I see.

02:26.863 --> 02:28.771
What's the news?

02:28.863 --> 02:30.488
What's the dealie, yo?

02:33.201 --> 02:36.949
Oprah Winfrey wants my new book,
Unfinished Business...

02:37.371 --> 02:40.455
for her January
Book of the Month Club Show.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.996
- You're kidding.
- I ain't kiddin'.

02:43.126 --> 02:45.794
Oh, my God! Your first novel?

02:46.170 --> 02:49.669
I was nervous when I heard
she wanted to read a preview copy.

02:49.798 --> 02:51.837
But she read it and loved it.

02:52.301 --> 02:55.586
- When's the release date?
- We go into print next month.

02:55.678 --> 02:59.759
Oh, baby! I'm so happy for you.

03:01.434 --> 03:04.054
I'm so happy for you!

03:05.353 --> 03:07.512
That is so great. So great.

03:07.606 --> 03:09.563
- I'm on my way, girl.
- The callaloo.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.651
I missed you.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.533
I'm glad you decided to come back
to town before heading to New York.

03:28.582 --> 03:31.536
Yeah. Me, too, baby.

03:33.336 --> 03:36.503
Did I tell you about the
20-city book tour I got going?

03:37.048 --> 03:41.875
I'm psyched. I gotta make sure
my shit's on point, though.

03:42.469 --> 03:46.169
- Harper, come on.
- "Harper, come on," what?

03:46.891 --> 03:48.965
You never live enough for today.

03:49.099 --> 03:51.935
For once, just enjoy the moment.

03:52.103 --> 03:53.727
At least for a little while?

03:53.812 --> 03:55.604
I got to stay focused.

03:55.731 --> 03:58.815
All work and no play
makes Harper a very dull boy.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.234
- Yeah, whatever, man.
- "Yeah, whatever, man."

04:03.363 --> 04:05.271
You're not feelin' me, huh?

04:06.615 --> 04:10.447
I felt you getting your freak on a
couple minutes ago. That's what I felt.

04:10.535 --> 04:13.370
- Only with you.
- That's what I like to hear.

04:16.248 --> 04:17.624
Oh, girl.

04:19.834 --> 04:22.540
I could be like this
with you forever, Harper.

04:24.214 --> 04:25.209
What?

04:26.299 --> 04:27.497
Relax.

04:30.053 --> 04:33.137
All I mean is that I
love being with you.

04:34.849 --> 04:38.217
You said yourself I was the
best girlfriend you ever had.

04:38.310 --> 04:41.678
You've never been with somebody
this long or had this much fun.

04:41.771 --> 04:43.894
Face it. We fit together.

04:45.817 --> 04:48.057
- Yeah, but...
- You love me, don't you?

04:48.610 --> 04:51.647
Of course I do. But
it's not that simple.

04:52.822 --> 04:54.613
It is to me.

05:06.501 --> 05:07.698
Dead silence.

05:08.837 --> 05:10.246
Nice. Excuse me.

05:11.130 --> 05:13.121
What's "Excuse me"? Wait.

05:13.257 --> 05:16.043
No. I think I'll get some sleep.

05:16.135 --> 05:17.415
Wait, Robin.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.402
Honey, about last night. I didn't...

05:36.986 --> 05:40.437
Harper, it's okay. I know you love me.

05:40.530 --> 05:43.365
- I do, you know.
- I'm not insecure.

05:44.952 --> 05:47.524
- I just have doubts sometimes.
- About what?

05:47.619 --> 05:50.241
Like this wedding reunion
with your friends.

05:51.498 --> 05:53.289
I don't know what I'm walking into.

05:53.375 --> 05:56.494
Oh, baby! They are gonna love you.

05:56.586 --> 05:59.255
Don't worry. They are gonna love you.
You'll be fine.

05:59.339 --> 06:00.501
- Really?
- Really.

06:00.590 --> 06:02.000
Even Kendall?

06:07.428 --> 06:11.426
I can't believe you're jealous of
a character I wrote in my book.

06:11.683 --> 06:14.352
Not just a character. An icon. An ideal.

06:14.435 --> 06:17.388
Your soul mate. Jackson's soul mate.

06:20.399 --> 06:23.316
- She's nothing like me.
- She's not like anybody.

06:24.193 --> 06:28.107
She is a combination of a bunch of women
that I knew in college.

06:28.238 --> 06:32.402
- Why would I lie to you about that?
- I don't know. That's what scares me.

06:33.452 --> 06:37.234
Okay, here it is. Here is the drama.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.995
I thought I had finally avoided it
in this relationship.

06:41.084 --> 06:43.041
I'm not perfect.

06:43.042 --> 06:44.997
Could we stop talking
about this, please?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.671
I had to let you know how I feel.

06:48.757 --> 06:51.877
- Are you still coming to the wedding?
- Of course I am.

06:52.093 --> 06:54.334
Nothing has changed about that.

06:55.638 --> 06:57.796
I want you to have fun.

06:58.223 --> 07:00.548
Hang out with your boys, reminisce.

07:02.394 --> 07:04.386
I'll still be there on Sunday.

07:04.645 --> 07:06.603
That's great. Fine. Good.

07:11.902 --> 07:15.817
Atlantic Airlines welcomes you
to New York City's La Guardia Airport.

07:17.115 --> 07:18.442
I'm coming!

07:34.337 --> 07:35.582
Harper!

07:37.340 --> 07:39.083
Murch! My man!

07:39.217 --> 07:41.375
It's the Doug Banks Show
with DeDe McGuire.

07:41.470 --> 07:44.885
Can you believe those Giants?
Lance Sullivan, my man!

07:44.973 --> 07:48.222
That man really is. He's fine.
Big old chocolate thing.

07:48.308 --> 07:51.559
- No, DeDe, he's a good football player.
- I know. I'm a fan.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.601
Right. Here's Lauryn Hill.

07:53.688 --> 07:55.728
What do you say about that?
So, they're fine.

07:55.729 --> 07:57.767
They're young, that's all.

07:57.859 --> 08:01.393
And I had to take a gun away
from one kid last week.

08:02.071 --> 08:03.695
Hell, no! A gun?

08:05.240 --> 08:06.782
Damn it, Murch!

08:06.866 --> 08:10.400
Didn't the firm you worked for last
summer offer you a six-figure salary?

08:10.494 --> 08:12.866
- Yes, they did.
- So what's up?

08:12.955 --> 08:14.912
I have to pass the bar first.

08:15.124 --> 08:16.535
Whatever, man.

08:17.333 --> 08:20.703
Brother, all I'm saying is,
if you're gonna be stressed...

08:21.087 --> 08:22.795
get paid for it, man.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.631
Now you sound like Shelby.

08:26.634 --> 08:27.832
Shelby.

08:28.510 --> 08:29.673
Lockdown!

08:32.514 --> 08:35.679
You are lucky I love you
like an adopted brother.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.801
I'm playing. Shelby's cool.

08:40.104 --> 08:43.222
You certainly didn't make her sound cool
in your book.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.355
I mean, not that I read your book.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.063
- You read my book?
- No.

08:50.112 --> 08:54.192
- How did you get ahold of my book?
- I don't have your book. Jordan does.

08:54.324 --> 08:55.902
Jordan has my book?

08:56.952 --> 08:58.695
Camera two,
I need a close-up on Dr. Gayle.

08:59.162 --> 09:01.320
Zoom in slowly, slowly.

09:01.956 --> 09:03.783
Great. Hold it right there.

09:03.874 --> 09:06.412
Camera one, stand by
for audience reaction.

09:06.501 --> 09:08.874
Give me audience reaction, camera one.

09:12.674 --> 09:14.049
Jordan Armstrong.

09:14.926 --> 09:17.417
She's already runnin' things, ain't she?

09:17.636 --> 09:19.546
You should not be surprised.

09:19.847 --> 09:22.469
She's the only one more driven
than you are.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.380
That's all right.

09:24.476 --> 09:29.268
- When's the last time you saw Jordan?
- Last March, actually.

09:29.814 --> 09:32.731
We didn't have much time to hang
'cause she had a deadline.

09:32.816 --> 09:34.774
And I had to move...

09:38.447 --> 09:39.609
What, nigger?

09:39.739 --> 09:42.942
You, my brother,
are withholding information.

09:43.117 --> 09:44.527
Here we go.

09:44.661 --> 09:47.115
You and Jordan got busy
in undergrad, didn't you?

09:47.204 --> 09:48.614
No, we didn't.

09:48.914 --> 09:52.116
What about the book?
Jackson and Kendall.

09:52.376 --> 09:53.917
That's you two. I know it!

09:54.002 --> 09:57.452
They picked the prime opportunity
to make grass sandwiches.

09:59.047 --> 10:01.373
"A passionate night
of lovemaking so intense..."

10:01.466 --> 10:04.218
I know my words.
Embellishment sells books.

10:05.386 --> 10:07.462
So, then what really happened?

10:09.431 --> 10:13.381
- Nothin'.
- You are lying! I know it.

10:13.853 --> 10:15.347
- Out with it.
- What?

10:15.520 --> 10:17.512
- Tell me. Tell me.
- Nothing.

10:23.277 --> 10:25.685
It was senior year during finals.

10:26.571 --> 10:28.677
The year-end issue was
off to the printer

10:28.678 --> 10:30.783
and the staff had left for the night.

10:30.868 --> 10:34.567
We both had studying to do,
but we were mad tired.

10:35.704 --> 10:38.540
Only Stevie Wonder
was gonna help us that night.

12:11.955 --> 12:15.537
- And you didn't tell any of us?
- There wasn't much to tell.

12:15.624 --> 12:17.701
And you know, you can't keep a secret.

12:17.794 --> 12:20.462
What do you mean I can't keep a secret?

12:20.796 --> 12:23.713
Were you supposed to tell me
that you had my book?

12:26.635 --> 12:28.010
Just finish the story.

12:58.788 --> 13:03.284
In retrospect, it was one of those
moments you wish you could have back.

13:04.626 --> 13:07.745
- But at the time, it just wasn't right.
- Wasn't right?

13:07.962 --> 13:10.121
- No.
- You two are ridiculous.

13:10.215 --> 13:11.127
Why?

13:11.214 --> 13:14.714
You forget. She was off to LA
to do that internship...

13:14.802 --> 13:16.794
I was headed straight to grad school.

13:16.887 --> 13:21.429
In other words, the two control freaks
couldn't lose control and get freaky?

13:24.434 --> 13:27.435
I almost forgot how corny you could be.

13:27.813 --> 13:29.141
Almost.

13:29.231 --> 13:32.765
- I thought it was a good play on words.
- It was kind of corny.

13:32.984 --> 13:34.016
Okay.

13:37.112 --> 13:38.940
Jordan, stop it.

13:39.031 --> 13:41.155
This is business.

13:41.825 --> 13:44.150
This is your boy. This
is strictly business.

13:44.244 --> 13:46.651
- It's all good. You don't have...
- Good job.

13:46.746 --> 13:49.416
Thanks, Anita. I think it was good,
but we could've...

13:49.499 --> 13:50.697
Is that him?

13:51.751 --> 13:55.450
Yes, indeed. That is Harper Stewart,
Lance Sullivan's best man.

13:55.713 --> 13:59.211
You sure we can't get a camera
at that wedding? It could be huge.

13:59.299 --> 14:02.583
I know. I've been working on that,
but they're adamant about it.

14:02.677 --> 14:03.840
Keep trying.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.551
Right.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.129
You ready?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.098
Ready.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.606
- Here she is.
- Harper Stewart.

14:22.235 --> 14:23.647
Jordan Armstrong.

14:24.238 --> 14:29.029
I've always enjoyed your writing.
But that book of yours? You nailed it.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.991
And your girl here. Talk about a fan.

14:31.076 --> 14:33.946
She's got her nose
in that preview copy every moment.

14:34.121 --> 14:36.872
It's my job to keep up
with what's current.

14:36.956 --> 14:38.498
Of course you do.

14:38.958 --> 14:42.790
Can we get you on Teen Summit,
or profile you on Tonight With Tavis?

14:43.713 --> 14:46.915
- Absolutely. Sure. I would like that.
- Great.

14:47.174 --> 14:49.499
We'll get Jordan to produce it.
What do you think?

14:49.593 --> 14:52.084
Absolutely. We've got the inside track.

14:53.554 --> 14:56.970
This is gonna be fabulous.
It was a pleasure meeting you both.

14:57.057 --> 15:00.427
- I've got to run. Take care, Harper.
- All right. Bye-bye.

15:02.646 --> 15:04.768
That's gonna be Jordan
in a little while.

15:04.855 --> 15:07.429
- She's well on her way.
- True.

15:08.151 --> 15:10.059
Come on, now. Give me love.

15:10.694 --> 15:12.237
Yeah, of course.

15:14.239 --> 15:17.655
Okay. Yeah. So, you know...

15:19.076 --> 15:22.445
Like Anita was saying,
we want to get you in the studio.

15:22.954 --> 15:25.955
You know me. I'm all yours.

15:30.586 --> 15:31.831
Right.

15:32.797 --> 15:35.962
Yeah. So, you guys ready to go?

15:36.425 --> 15:40.636
I'll talk to you later. 'Bye.
Damn, this wedding shit! It never ends.

15:40.721 --> 15:42.759
- Who wants ham hocks?
- Lance's uncles.

15:42.847 --> 15:46.133
Mia's cousins have the nerve
to be calling me, driving me nuts...

15:46.225 --> 15:48.384
asking me to hook them up with guys.

15:48.478 --> 15:51.929
- You should introduce them to Quentin.
- I did. Big mistake.

15:52.230 --> 15:54.353
He's got the poor girls open.

15:54.441 --> 15:57.358
- Charming motherfucker.
- That's what he's good at.

15:57.944 --> 16:01.526
If they gave college credit for that,
he'd have his Ph.D. By now.

16:03.657 --> 16:05.982
You know, Dr. Feelgood has your book.

16:06.494 --> 16:08.700
Quentin has my book?

16:36.978 --> 16:39.266
- Go on, baby.
- Quentin Spivey!

17:05.752 --> 17:08.375
Quentin Spivey from
our nation's capital.

17:10.423 --> 17:13.045
I'm gonna have to do a story on him.

17:13.175 --> 17:15.666
- I'll be right back.
- All right, cool.

17:16.054 --> 17:17.678
- You want a drink?
- No.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.712
- What's wrong with you?
- You talk too much.

17:20.848 --> 17:23.554
- See you later. Peace.
- Why'd you tell him everything?

17:24.770 --> 17:27.686
So, Q, what's up with the guitar?

17:29.023 --> 17:33.436
This? Just a little something
to add to the repertoire.

17:34.195 --> 17:37.693
- You know a nigger got gifts.
- The nigger's scatterbrained.

17:38.073 --> 17:41.406
I had to pull strings to get you
that photography gig at the Post.

17:41.492 --> 17:44.529
- What happened?
- Don't get all bent.

17:46.288 --> 17:47.782
You know I read your book.

17:47.873 --> 17:50.328
I heard. So?

17:50.667 --> 17:53.751
So, you got skills, Joe.

17:54.837 --> 17:58.088
I ain't gonna front.
You about to blow the fuck up.

17:58.716 --> 18:00.905
Get me wanting to
be a writer and shit.

18:00.906 --> 18:03.093
See, man, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

18:03.386 --> 18:06.969
First it was photography.
Then you got this music thing going.

18:07.056 --> 18:11.005
Back in January,
you wanted to direct music videos.

18:11.311 --> 18:15.141
- Now you want to be a writer.
- Don't sweat none of that shit, Joe.

18:16.147 --> 18:19.481
Seriously, that book is like that.

18:20.068 --> 18:23.899
I still think you might have exaggerated
a brother's character a little bit.

18:23.988 --> 18:27.819
My Mama not being around ain't got shit
to do with how I treat these bitches.

18:27.908 --> 18:29.817
How do you know I'm talkin' about you?

18:29.909 --> 18:32.826
Come on, now.
Give a nigger some credit, all right?

18:33.621 --> 18:37.950
I ain't stupid. I was more focused
than that when I was in school.

18:38.042 --> 18:39.785
You're still in school.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.875
But I'm sayin'...

18:42.421 --> 18:45.456
couldn't you have embellished
a nigger a little bit?

18:45.548 --> 18:48.465
Ain't that that buttery shit
about being a writer?

18:48.676 --> 18:51.132
You know, rewritin' history?

18:53.638 --> 18:56.757
Tailorin' shit to fit
your own ideal self?

18:56.976 --> 19:00.593
I know where you're going,
so just chill with that.

19:00.811 --> 19:02.769
The frontal lobe, shorty?

19:03.063 --> 19:07.227
- Ain't nothin' there. Just leave it be.
- All I'm sayin' is...

19:07.818 --> 19:10.189
it brought back some wild memories.

19:10.403 --> 19:13.155
You know, shit I ain't thought about
in years.

19:13.281 --> 19:14.989
Know what I'm sayin'?

19:17.451 --> 19:19.610
Yeah, man. Where's the book now?

19:26.459 --> 19:27.835
Running back!

19:51.273 --> 19:54.475
- You know what? You play too much.
- You're spilling your stuff.

19:54.566 --> 19:56.725
- That was a great show.
- Thank you.

19:56.986 --> 19:58.610
Can you imagine? Look at him.

19:58.696 --> 20:00.106
L-Boogie!

20:00.196 --> 20:03.695
- They love him in the Big Apple.
- You know they're talkin' Super Bowl.

20:03.783 --> 20:05.443
What are they now? 6 and 0?

20:05.534 --> 20:08.570
He's been carryin' them
all the way to the bye week.

20:10.289 --> 20:13.326
We gotta move back here.
I got you all set up back here.

20:16.294 --> 20:18.750
- I'm gonna go get the superstar.
- What you up to?

20:18.838 --> 20:21.673
- I'm not up to anything.
- Still got your mama's jacket on.

20:21.757 --> 20:23.583
Will you stop, you two?

20:24.551 --> 20:27.255
- Excuse me. Mr. Lance Sullivan?
- Thank you.

20:28.596 --> 20:30.885
- Harper, man! What's up?
- How you feelin'?

20:30.974 --> 20:34.508
- I'm all right, but I am stressed.
- You ought to be.

20:34.602 --> 20:37.685
Why are you planning a wedding
in the middle of the season?

20:37.771 --> 20:40.476
- You got Dallas next week.
- I wasn't even thinking.

20:40.565 --> 20:42.356
It's what the little lady wanted.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.015
The best man is here.
I'm gonna hook you up.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.317
I'll get you over that
broom if it kills me.

20:47.405 --> 20:49.065
Good to see you, man.

20:50.032 --> 20:51.231
How are you?

20:51.658 --> 20:55.702
- Sorry I missed your show.
- Congratulations, big man.

20:56.913 --> 20:58.952
- You doing all right?
- Yes, sir.

20:59.165 --> 21:00.873
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

21:00.958 --> 21:01.989
Julian!

21:04.461 --> 21:06.537
Hi, Shel.

21:07.756 --> 21:09.380
Hello, honey.

21:12.009 --> 21:15.591
Well, well, well.
The gang's all here, back in effect.

21:16.137 --> 21:19.589
- Break out the forties.
- Hey, Shelby.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.676
It's nice to see all of you, too.

21:25.814 --> 21:27.306
Harper Stewart.

21:28.107 --> 21:32.353
- Richard Wrong, Langston Snooze.
- Hi, Shelby.

21:32.486 --> 21:35.901
I heard about your book,
and I don't think it's cute.

21:36.364 --> 21:40.860
Next time you want to characterize me
in one of your projects, do me a favor.

21:41.243 --> 21:43.366
- What would that be?
- Don't.

21:44.788 --> 21:48.287
Drive me to Saks. I can't decide
what I should wear for the wedding.

21:48.374 --> 21:51.957
- I thought you were wearing...
- No, no. I decided against that.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.419
I thought I told you I had plans.

21:57.842 --> 21:59.880
What kind of plans?

21:59.967 --> 22:03.466
- I'm hanging out with the guys tonight.
- Honey, that can wait.

22:03.554 --> 22:07.551
You have all weekend for that.
This'll only take a few hours. Come on.

22:16.607 --> 22:17.770
I see.

22:18.734 --> 22:20.726
It's "Gang up on Shelby" day.

22:21.528 --> 22:22.607
Fine.

22:22.905 --> 22:25.822
If you'd rather be with them than me,
that's fine.

22:26.783 --> 22:28.277
Here it comes.

22:30.995 --> 22:32.952
Am I being that unreasonable?

22:35.875 --> 22:37.155
No.

22:37.334 --> 22:40.085
Honey, no. No, no. I'm sorry.

22:40.545 --> 22:42.501
Murch, we'll catch up with you later.

22:42.587 --> 22:44.628
Yeah, I'll see you guys later.

22:44.715 --> 22:47.467
- Baby, you're the best.
- She be givin' young one drama.

22:47.551 --> 22:50.634
- Seven years of the same shit.
- She makes it hard for sisters.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.341
- I know she gotta have a LoJack on him.
- Harper!

22:55.641 --> 22:57.052
I'm watching you.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.109
Damn, Lance.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.361
- That contract is fat, huh?
- Obese, player.

23:38.304 --> 23:41.055
- Hey, mama.
- Come here.

23:41.432 --> 23:43.175
It's so good to see you.

23:43.308 --> 23:46.475
- How are you?
- I'm good. You look really great.

23:46.561 --> 23:48.304
- So do you.
- How can you tell?

23:48.396 --> 23:50.685
You got him so hemmed up.

23:50.686 --> 23:52.973
Lance, shut up. Don't
pay him any mind.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.544
I won't.

23:54.545 --> 23:55.937
I don't see why you
love this fool so much.

23:56.027 --> 23:58.399
He ain't shit. You ain't shit, dog.

23:59.447 --> 24:01.653
It's because he's a true friend.

24:01.824 --> 24:04.741
And he dedicated his first novel to us.

24:05.744 --> 24:09.077
- So you read my book, too.
- No, but I heard great things.

24:09.622 --> 24:10.785
That's good.

24:10.916 --> 24:13.666
When's that girlfriend coming?
I can't wait to meet her.

24:13.752 --> 24:16.917
- You've kept this one under wraps.
- And for good reason.

24:17.087 --> 24:20.338
Bringing her around y'all
might taint her image of me.

24:21.132 --> 24:22.923
She's comin' on Sunday.

24:23.051 --> 24:25.458
You're always so secretive, Harper.

24:26.054 --> 24:30.881
Oh, no! Look at the size of this rock!
I'm gonna go blind lookin' at it.

24:30.974 --> 24:34.058
She's got to do finger curls
just to hold that mug up.

24:34.186 --> 24:36.473
- Stop it, y'all.
- Don't be jelly.

24:36.813 --> 24:38.769
Nothin's too good for my little Mia.

24:38.857 --> 24:41.015
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

24:42.192 --> 24:45.727
Damn. Would you cut it out
with that Leave It To Beaver shit?

24:46.404 --> 24:48.942
What happened, Mia?
You called me earlier.

24:49.241 --> 24:50.699
The caterer's trippin'...

24:50.784 --> 24:54.117
the florist screwed up the order
and Mama hasn't found a dress.

24:54.203 --> 24:56.991
Girlfriend, don't worry.
Superwoman is here.

24:57.081 --> 24:58.658
- All right.
- Let's go.

24:58.999 --> 25:02.581
Y'all hurry. We ain't got all night.
Got men stuff to do, right?

25:02.668 --> 25:05.290
Lance, go away.
Show Harper the rest of the house.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.337
- Come on, cat.
- All right, man.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.257
- It's great to see you, Harper.
- You too, sweetie.

25:10.342 --> 25:14.126
This is where we're gonna put
the big screen with that DVD system.

25:24.605 --> 25:26.680
Yeah, front page, kid.

25:26.773 --> 25:29.857
We were almost used the one
of you draggin' those five dudes...

25:29.943 --> 25:32.860
over the goal line,
but we thought this told it all.

25:32.945 --> 25:36.314
I'm surprised you took the holy road.
You're not a spiritual person.

25:36.407 --> 25:39.989
You know I'm not into that mess.
It's just about the story.

25:40.785 --> 25:43.490
Someday you'll believe in my God.
Our God.

25:43.579 --> 25:46.035
- Whatever, man.
- What's up?

25:47.583 --> 25:50.998
You got to tell me, man.
What happened in Pittsburgh?

25:51.169 --> 25:54.170
- Dog, twins. Two sets.
- Shut up.

25:54.797 --> 25:58.083
Yes. They were waiting for me
in the hotel room, right?

25:58.301 --> 26:02.963
This agent sent them. They had these
big-ass titties, like punching bags.

26:04.139 --> 26:07.674
- Four of them?
- Four was nice. It was nice.

26:07.767 --> 26:11.812
- Praise the Lord and pass the panties.
- Words to live by, dog.

26:12.605 --> 26:13.636
Harper?

26:13.730 --> 26:16.435
I don't mean to interrupt,
but here are the ads.

26:16.525 --> 26:18.149
I convinced Friday's to place one...

26:18.235 --> 26:21.105
provided it's next
to Lance Sullivan's photo.

26:21.196 --> 26:24.280
You got Friday's. Cool. Okay.
Thank you, Mia.

26:26.075 --> 26:27.901
Pardon me. I'm Mia Morgan.

26:28.285 --> 26:30.361
The pleasure's all mine, baby.

26:30.454 --> 26:32.611
How nice. But what is your name?

26:33.164 --> 26:34.907
This is Lance Sullivan.

26:35.916 --> 26:37.197
You're Lance Sullivan!

26:37.292 --> 26:41.124
I apologize. I didn't recognize you.
You look bigger on television.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.131
Harper, I gotta get to Econ...

26:45.217 --> 26:48.502
but I can take those deposits
to the bank if you want.

26:50.096 --> 26:51.555
Thank you, Mia.

26:52.389 --> 26:54.429
That was a great game on Saturday.

26:54.516 --> 26:56.805
Okay. So, you've seen me play.

26:57.311 --> 27:00.062
- I love the game.
- She's seen me play.

27:01.730 --> 27:06.025
I think you'd get more yardage
if you used your offensive line more.

27:06.110 --> 27:08.897
And you would want to stop planting
so hard on turf.

27:08.987 --> 27:12.522
Your knees won't last through
junior year if you keep that up.

27:15.159 --> 27:16.654
Just think about it.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.159
- Okay. See ya.
- 'Bye, Mia.

27:21.415 --> 27:24.617
- Who is that? Is that you, player?
- No. We're just friends.

27:24.709 --> 27:28.042
- Word has it, she's savin' it.
- A virgin?

27:28.505 --> 27:31.209
- Yeah, man.
- Really, man? You got to hook me!

27:31.633 --> 27:33.376
- Hell, no.
- Hell, yes.

27:33.468 --> 27:38.342
She's a good girl. She comes to work
on time, she's dependable. No.

27:38.430 --> 27:40.801
Come on. She could be Mrs. Sullivan.

27:41.515 --> 27:43.787
So could those four
freaks from Pittsburgh

27:43.788 --> 27:46.058
with the saddle-back
titties, bionic dick.

27:46.145 --> 27:47.343
I got ya.

27:47.437 --> 27:49.763
You gonna pay for that though.

27:51.483 --> 27:52.942
There you go.

27:52.943 --> 27:54.400
The station will buy
us lunch tomorrow.

27:54.486 --> 27:56.359
I'll pick you up around 11:00.

27:56.445 --> 27:59.316
Splendid, Ms. Armstrong.
That fits well into my schedule.

27:59.406 --> 28:00.900
I'll call to confirm.

28:01.366 --> 28:03.857
So, what, a sister
can't be professional?

28:04.536 --> 28:07.619
Here we go.
I guess some things never change.

28:08.039 --> 28:10.114
Change is overrated, Harper.

28:10.291 --> 28:12.864
All you had to do was ask me
for a copy of my book.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.751
You wouldn't have given it to me.

28:14.837 --> 28:18.454
True. But at least I would have known
that you were interested.

28:19.757 --> 28:21.630
Don't play yourself, Harper.

28:21.717 --> 28:25.003
I want the exclusive. You can save
the sloppy seconds for Oprah.

28:25.095 --> 28:28.595
If that's the case, how come you
can't look at me in my face?

28:33.977 --> 28:38.272
Harper, why'd you really leave your girl
at home this weekend?

28:40.734 --> 28:42.584
'Cause I wanted to hang
out with the guys.

28:42.585 --> 28:44.434
You know, cut up with the boys...

28:44.529 --> 28:48.028
before she came, that's all.
It's been a while. You know?

28:52.119 --> 28:53.578
Good night, Harper.

28:54.704 --> 28:55.984
Damn.

28:57.832 --> 28:59.825
Come on, Harp! Let's go!

29:03.087 --> 29:04.979
I'm about to run a
Boston on you niggers.

29:04.980 --> 29:06.870
Y'all about to be set.

29:07.215 --> 29:11.378
Do you always have to talk trash?
Come on. It's just a game.

29:11.469 --> 29:16.011
- That's what all punk-ass losers say.
- Easy, Mojo, leave the boy alone.

29:16.098 --> 29:18.303
"Mojo." I haven't heard that in a clip.

29:18.392 --> 29:20.051
"Mo" to the "jo."

29:20.142 --> 29:23.144
That's what I'll be puttin' on my ladies
when I do my thing.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.771
Got them turned the hell out.

29:24.855 --> 29:28.474
They be makin' breakfast for this fool,
buyin' him jewelry.

29:28.567 --> 29:32.066
Then they try to figure out why,
'cause they really hate his yellow ass.

29:32.154 --> 29:34.478
Then he drops them like a bad habit.

29:37.033 --> 29:38.409
Hold up, man.

29:38.952 --> 29:42.616
I know you ain't talkin' about a
nigger leavin' a whore strung out.

29:42.704 --> 29:46.203
- True. You're the serial monogamist.
- Serial what?

29:46.291 --> 29:47.726
Yes.

29:47.727 --> 29:49.161
Nigger, you be having
these girlfriends.

29:49.252 --> 29:52.455
Better yet, these jive-ass
public relationships.

29:52.547 --> 29:55.333
Talkin' about, "This
is my queen" and shit.

29:55.466 --> 29:59.511
And the first moment she steps out
of your little boundary, she's gone.

29:59.595 --> 30:01.005
Dismissed with the quicks.

30:01.096 --> 30:05.306
That's because none of them
have ever measured up to Jordan.

30:07.935 --> 30:09.726
Excellent point, Counsel Murchison.

30:09.812 --> 30:12.646
There it is right there. Sustained.

30:12.732 --> 30:15.767
- Get out of here!
- You know that's true.

30:16.108 --> 30:18.481
Jordan's the best
girlfriend you never had.

30:18.570 --> 30:21.239
Wait. Did you guys know they kissed
in undergrad?

30:21.322 --> 30:23.895
Up in the newsroom. I remember that.

30:25.034 --> 30:28.118
- You knew about that?
- Yeah, we knew about that shit.

30:31.539 --> 30:34.112
You know damn well
you can't keep a secret.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.533
That is so messed up.

30:36.627 --> 30:39.200
- Come on, man.
- Is that the case there?

30:39.295 --> 30:42.213
You waitin' for Jordan to slow down
from that career path...

30:42.298 --> 30:46.130
- for the Harper rest stop?
- You're trippin'. Let's play the game.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.887
I still can't believe you
ain't never hit that.

30:48.971 --> 30:49.884
Me, neither.

30:49.971 --> 30:53.221
Hey, y'all.
I'm in a very fulfilling relationship.

30:53.392 --> 30:57.389
A virtually drama-free two
years tomorrow. Okay?

30:57.520 --> 30:59.559
That's right. She's a stand-up comic.

30:59.646 --> 31:01.224
No, no. She makes jewelry.

31:01.315 --> 31:05.977
- She is a teacher.
- She is a caterer, goddamn it!

31:07.070 --> 31:09.193
For the last time.

31:09.364 --> 31:12.150
It took her a while
to find her creative niche.

31:12.367 --> 31:14.738
She found it. She's a caterer.

31:14.910 --> 31:17.400
I can definitely relate to that one.

31:17.954 --> 31:20.326
But she still don't sound like Jordan.

31:20.414 --> 31:23.748
- 'Cause she ain't Jordan. She's Robin.
- I'm glad she ain't Jordan.

31:23.834 --> 31:27.749
- Why you say that?
- She's too damn sassy and independent.

31:28.255 --> 31:30.710
And she might make more cheese
than you someday.

31:30.798 --> 31:34.084
- Yeah? And?
- I love Jordan. You know that.

31:34.177 --> 31:37.012
But let's face it.
A woman like that don't need no man.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.005
She's one step from lesbian.

31:43.059 --> 31:45.301
No, hold on. That's a nice thought.

31:47.855 --> 31:50.264
The only way a relationship works...

31:50.358 --> 31:53.940
is if the man provides the loot,
and the woman takes care of the home.

31:54.028 --> 31:55.588
You're talkin' like you
from the Stone Age.

31:55.589 --> 31:57.147
You're a caveman.

31:57.239 --> 31:59.564
- Admit it, man.
- Isn't that ironic?

31:59.699 --> 32:02.368
Brothers are always talking
about gold diggers...

32:02.451 --> 32:05.535
yet you can't take an educated sister
who makes more money?

32:05.621 --> 32:08.491
- No, I can't.
- Murch, we know you don't care.

32:08.582 --> 32:11.036
Your woman gonna run
your ass regardless.

32:11.335 --> 32:14.085
Bite it. Okay? Bite it.

32:14.963 --> 32:16.504
Grow it, Murchie.

32:20.384 --> 32:23.337
When me and Mia get married,
her only job's gonna be...

32:23.428 --> 32:25.919
being my wife and raisin' our kids.

32:26.013 --> 32:29.049
- She's gonna be content with that?
- Are you kiddin'?

32:29.267 --> 32:33.595
Mia's straight-up old school. She can't
wait to drop this Mandingo's babies.

32:33.771 --> 32:37.720
- Consummate mother-whore.
- Word is bond, dog. Word is bond.

32:37.816 --> 32:39.938
- Every man wants one.
- Right.

32:40.859 --> 32:43.351
- Let me ask you a question.
- What's that?

32:43.988 --> 32:48.032
What made you decide to up
and get married now?

32:48.325 --> 32:52.275
'Cause you been dippin' out on Mia,
no offense, for a while.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.577
- And with the new contract...
- Oh, yes.

32:54.664 --> 32:58.163
You'll need a catcher's mitt to catch
all the new pussy comin' your way.

32:58.250 --> 33:02.793
I done have all the ass 10 men can have.
My wild oats are sown.

33:03.672 --> 33:05.960
How much ass can one man have anyway?

33:06.215 --> 33:07.626
A lot.

33:09.260 --> 33:10.755
It's just time.

33:11.678 --> 33:14.964
Marriage is sacred.
My folks have been together 35 years.

33:15.223 --> 33:16.966
It means something to me.

33:17.099 --> 33:18.380
I hear that.

33:19.185 --> 33:22.554
Besides, marriage is gonna curb
my appetite for more women.

33:23.272 --> 33:27.815
In case you didn't know,
marriage is the cure to promiscuity.

33:28.485 --> 33:31.734
- In what world?
- I can't believe you said that.

33:32.863 --> 33:34.523
Goddamn, Lance.

33:34.991 --> 33:39.533
You'd never known you graduated summa
cum laude. You say some dumb-ass shit.

33:40.912 --> 33:44.697
There's a time for everything, players.
We're in the real world now.

33:44.791 --> 33:48.124
The real world. Real things.

33:49.711 --> 33:50.826
Bang.

33:53.131 --> 33:55.705
I don't give a damn what y'all say.

33:56.384 --> 33:58.590
Ain't nothin' natural about no monogamy.

33:58.678 --> 34:01.797
God did not intend for us to be
with just one person.

34:02.056 --> 34:05.424
If He had, He wouldn't have
given us all this sperm.

34:05.516 --> 34:08.601
These bitches would not outnumber us
the way they do.

34:08.728 --> 34:10.056
Okay, okay.

34:10.730 --> 34:12.723
Are you a philosophy major now?

34:12.815 --> 34:15.851
- He is a bullshit artist.
- Thank you.

34:20.947 --> 34:22.275
Fuck y'all, man.

34:22.866 --> 34:26.909
Y'all know there ain't nothin' better
than pussy, except some new pussy.

34:27.411 --> 34:29.120
You got a point there.

34:33.123 --> 34:37.335
You can't trust these bitches anyway.
They as scandalous as us niggers.

34:38.087 --> 34:40.659
Not all women, player. Not all women.

34:42.800 --> 34:46.168
Oh, so, you don't think
that Mia ever got with other dudes.

34:47.011 --> 34:49.882
I'm the first, the last and the only.

34:51.349 --> 34:52.344
Really?

34:52.641 --> 34:53.672
Really.

35:00.106 --> 35:01.850
How do you know this?

35:05.486 --> 35:08.605
'Cause the pussy curves to my dick.
That's how I know.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.481
Besides, I know my little angel.

35:11.950 --> 35:16.945
You mean to tell me with all the
stickin' and movin' you've done...

35:18.497 --> 35:22.495
you don't think that Mia's ever
tippy-toed out the door on you once?

35:23.461 --> 35:24.491
No.

35:25.212 --> 35:27.419
Quentin, just play.

35:32.551 --> 35:36.844
If she did go out
and get her little swerve on...

35:38.139 --> 35:41.140
don't you think
she'd be well within her rights?

35:44.603 --> 35:46.098
It's karma, baby.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.622
Gotta take a piss.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.794
Why did you have to do that?

36:23.513 --> 36:25.006
Whose hand is it?

36:30.226 --> 36:33.144
Honestly, have you ever fooled around
with a girl?

36:33.646 --> 36:35.805
What do you mean? Yes, you have.

36:36.941 --> 36:39.609
That night I met you, you was talkin'...

36:39.735 --> 36:42.191
Hold on a second. What's up?

36:43.363 --> 36:45.735
- The book.
- I don't know. I'm talkin'.

36:46.449 --> 36:48.489
Go on, man. It's in there.

36:49.327 --> 36:50.821
Yeah, I'm back.

36:52.287 --> 36:56.783
You didn't mess around with a girl.
Ever mess around with two guys at once?

36:58.126 --> 37:00.082
Not even in high school?

37:03.547 --> 37:04.792
Here we go.

37:05.799 --> 37:08.883
You best get your own copy, player.

37:08.969 --> 37:12.088
I was just feelin' a little
overprotective of my stuff.

37:12.180 --> 37:15.549
It's too late for that.
I cannot wait to read this mug.

37:16.017 --> 37:18.768
- I know it's gonna be tight.
- Well, you know...

37:19.977 --> 37:21.602
help yourself, man.

37:23.273 --> 37:25.561
Look at you, man.
You know you're blessed.

37:25.650 --> 37:27.476
The Lord is smilin' on you.

37:27.568 --> 37:29.856
Dead that. I make it happen...

37:30.113 --> 37:34.358
not some heavenly being
in the clouds possessing me.

37:34.449 --> 37:36.856
- Know what I'm saying? Me.
- You're ignorant.

37:36.952 --> 37:39.656
How do you think we're as fortunate
as we are?

37:39.787 --> 37:41.993
Any one of us. We could
be poor, homeless,

37:41.994 --> 37:44.199
out on the street with nothing.

37:44.833 --> 37:47.502
Lance, tuxedo fitting tomorrow?

37:49.504 --> 37:51.627
Yeah. We gotta push it back till 5:00...

37:51.715 --> 37:54.798
'cause Mia's got a laundry
list of things for this brother.

37:54.884 --> 37:58.051
Actually that's cool, 'cause I'm
supposed to link up with Jordan.

37:58.137 --> 37:59.880
That's right. Jordan.

38:01.097 --> 38:03.256
I saw how she was
lookin' at you tonight.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.010
What did you see?

38:05.101 --> 38:09.228
- I saw she wants to get with you.
- Whatever, man.

38:09.313 --> 38:12.812
Yeah, "Whatever, man."
You'll be smackin' bellies this weekend.

38:12.899 --> 38:15.213
What happened to that
talk about fidelity

38:15.214 --> 38:17.526
and puttin' an end to promiscuity?

38:17.612 --> 38:20.529
I was talkin' about me.
That don't apply to you.

38:21.031 --> 38:22.063
Look here, man.

38:22.158 --> 38:26.237
You got your girl, and y'all doin'
a relationship thing, and that's cool.

38:26.494 --> 38:30.160
But, Harp, you my boy, my man, my ace!

38:30.581 --> 38:33.832
Jordan is fine, dog.
So for once in your life...

38:35.043 --> 38:37.167
go ahead on and be a dog, dog.

38:42.258 --> 38:45.175
- I'm gettin' a headache.
- Now you're gettin' a headache.

38:45.262 --> 38:46.970
- Later, man.
- All right.

38:47.721 --> 38:49.299
All right, Murch, man.

38:49.598 --> 38:51.141
Coming, dear.

38:53.977 --> 38:56.468
That's not the worst thing in the world.

38:56.812 --> 39:00.228
- They were gonna read it anyway, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

39:00.399 --> 39:02.890
I just didn't think they'd
take it so literally.

39:02.985 --> 39:04.894
I'm sure it'll be fine, baby.

39:05.446 --> 39:09.573
- Hey. I'm glad you called me.
- Yeah.

39:10.199 --> 39:12.656
Yeah, you're right. It'll be okay.

39:13.578 --> 39:16.745
Listen. Did you figure out
what you're wearing to the wedding?

39:16.831 --> 39:17.910
Not yet.

39:18.207 --> 39:21.789
How about that little beige number
you got?

39:21.918 --> 39:25.251
- Strapless?
- I know how to dress for a wedding.

39:25.463 --> 39:27.954
- It's under control.
- Okay. That's cool.

39:28.215 --> 39:30.670
I'm not trying to... Oh, my God!

39:32.468 --> 39:33.631
Oh, my God!

39:34.847 --> 39:36.803
Oh, my God, look at the time.

39:36.889 --> 39:39.511
- I gotta get out of here.
- Okay. I love you.

39:40.559 --> 39:41.638
What?

39:41.852 --> 39:43.512
I said, "I love you."

39:48.483 --> 39:53.026
I gotta go. So, I'll see you, baby.
Okay?

39:59.284 --> 40:01.692
- 'Morning.
- Good morning.

40:03.204 --> 40:06.240
I'm gonna be a second.

40:06.582 --> 40:09.417
- Chop, chop. Time is money.
- Okay.

40:18.217 --> 40:19.711
Nice boxers.

40:20.343 --> 40:22.835
I thought you were
strictly a briefs man.

40:22.930 --> 40:25.171
They were a gift from Robin.

40:26.307 --> 40:28.300
The girl's got taste.

40:36.566 --> 40:39.437
What about you?
You got any social life goin' on?

40:39.527 --> 40:42.860
Not really. My professional
and personal life cross over so much...

40:42.947 --> 40:45.271
I don't know where
to draw the line anymore.

40:45.365 --> 40:49.114
But I'm fine with that, because
sacrifice is the name of the game.

40:49.410 --> 40:52.661
- You can't let work consume you.
- What?

40:53.373 --> 40:56.326
Please, Harper.
That doesn't even sound like you.

40:57.459 --> 41:00.829
- Maybe I'm maturing.
- Maybe you're full of shit.

41:01.796 --> 41:04.750
I know how badly you want
that limelight. I see it.

41:04.842 --> 41:09.300
I recognize it in myself. And besides,
you made that painfully obvious...

41:09.388 --> 41:12.590
- in your depiction of Kendall.
- I call it like I see it.

41:12.681 --> 41:17.389
Then you must not see yourself too well,
because you are exactly the same.

41:19.771 --> 41:21.810
Two peas in a pod, huh?

41:23.315 --> 41:28.143
You know, your girl,
she must be real patient or real dumb.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.820
Robin deals with it.

41:30.905 --> 41:35.483
She understands that I had dreams in my
life way before I had thoughts of her.

41:37.119 --> 41:39.610
She is startin' to get that itch though.

41:41.082 --> 41:43.536
- The "M" word, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.416
You got a problem with that?

41:46.503 --> 41:49.124
I mean, yeah! Marriage, you know?

41:49.714 --> 41:51.255
Movin' in together.

41:51.507 --> 41:55.552
The last person you ever have sex with.
Ever.

41:56.428 --> 41:58.087
That's pretty deep.

41:58.680 --> 42:01.349
At least you're gettin'
some on the regular.

42:01.933 --> 42:03.095
What?

42:03.726 --> 42:06.643
You ain't gettin' none? Jordan!

42:07.562 --> 42:09.555
Six months and counting.

42:09.648 --> 42:12.932
And longer than that,
if you're talking about good sex.

42:13.067 --> 42:15.854
You know what they say:
All work and no play makes...

42:15.946 --> 42:18.614
Jordan a horny nut basket.

42:21.616 --> 42:26.112
Okay. I'm gonna go with the pasta bowls
with the serving utensils.

42:26.329 --> 42:28.570
- Okay.
- Thank you. Right?

42:28.831 --> 42:30.241
Good choice.

42:31.082 --> 42:35.127
Have you ever had Mia's shrimp scampi
with the linguini?

42:36.380 --> 42:38.087
Yes, it is a bomb.

42:38.173 --> 42:42.086
She used to cook like at the drop
of a hat, and good stuff, too.

42:42.468 --> 42:45.503
- Yeah. Girlfriend can throw it out.
- That she does.

42:46.054 --> 42:47.429
Little Mia.

42:49.850 --> 42:51.557
That girl's got talent.

42:55.689 --> 43:00.016
Oh, my God!

43:02.111 --> 43:03.568
What's wrong with you?

43:03.653 --> 43:07.650
You scandalous dog.

43:08.657 --> 43:09.820
Jordan.

43:10.116 --> 43:14.494
Harper, don't walk away from me. This
whole thing, it makes perfect sense.

43:14.913 --> 43:16.620
- Do you take Visa?
- Yes, sir.

43:16.706 --> 43:18.699
We just switched places.

43:19.083 --> 43:21.834
Mia's Kacey, you're Jackson
and I'm Kendall.

43:21.920 --> 43:24.492
- You're bugging the fuck out.
- I'm Kendall.

43:24.630 --> 43:26.538
Jackson sexes me crazy.

43:26.632 --> 43:29.586
Except you and I,
we never actually had sex.

43:29.718 --> 43:33.963
And all Kacey and Jackson do is sleep in
the same bed, like you and I used to do.

43:34.054 --> 43:36.510
The pressures of this
wedding are getting to you.

43:36.599 --> 43:41.224
Oh, my God! The forehead kiss.
That is a dead giveaway.

43:41.854 --> 43:45.436
- What are you talking about?
- The forehead kiss!

43:45.689 --> 43:49.354
It's endearing. Shit!
It's damn near erotic!

43:49.443 --> 43:51.600
You almost got me with it. It's...

43:51.695 --> 43:54.102
It's bullshit, okay?

43:54.446 --> 43:58.658
We're talking about fictitious accounts
of experiences I've gone through...

43:58.868 --> 44:00.777
friends that I've known.

44:02.371 --> 44:03.699
What? Now what?

44:04.623 --> 44:07.577
You actually dedicated
that book to them?

44:08.210 --> 44:11.792
Are you crazy?
Do you want to be found out?

44:12.504 --> 44:14.462
- That is sick!
- You're right.

44:14.548 --> 44:18.048
What you're suggesting to me
is sick and ludicrous.

44:18.218 --> 44:20.923
So take a step back,
use your head and think.

44:21.304 --> 44:25.348
If Lance finds out what went down,
you better use your feet and run.

44:25.474 --> 44:28.391
That's cute. First off,
you need a sedative.

44:28.644 --> 44:31.598
Secondly, Lance has a million
important things to do...

44:31.688 --> 44:33.596
to keep his mind from wandering...

44:33.690 --> 44:36.774
on outlandish flights of fancy
from my little book.

44:36.859 --> 44:40.523
As a matter of fact,
he won't have time to read it.

44:40.613 --> 44:43.019
"White boys admired his prowess
on the hardwood...

44:43.115 --> 44:44.906
"...and his reputation with the ladies.

44:44.991 --> 44:47.660
"They secretly deemed him
'The Ebony Humper."'

44:50.037 --> 44:52.113
This joint is hilarious, boy!

44:54.541 --> 44:56.001
Oh, man.

44:56.085 --> 44:58.871
I'm gonna see you at the church.

45:01.630 --> 45:04.335
- See you been reading.
- Yeah, I been reading.

45:04.425 --> 45:07.545
That's funny.
I figured you wouldn't have enough time.

45:07.762 --> 45:10.086
Me neither, man.
I had insomnia last night...

45:10.180 --> 45:12.885
and, player, I am on edge, man.

45:13.224 --> 45:16.260
Quentin's right.
It's a page-turner like a mug, man.

45:16.602 --> 45:18.725
- Quentin said that?
- Yeah. You know what?

45:18.813 --> 45:21.516
It's a good thing you changed this dude
to a hoop star.

45:21.607 --> 45:25.818
I'll have to disassociate myself from
this shit. This dude banged many whores.

45:25.902 --> 45:27.147
You know what?

45:27.737 --> 45:30.275
I'm flattered, but was
I really that bad?

45:31.365 --> 45:33.322
Yeah, you were.

45:34.784 --> 45:38.318
You're right. I can't deny it. Oh, man!

45:41.957 --> 45:44.198
Harp, open up, man!

45:45.336 --> 45:47.742
- What's up?
- I need your help, man.

45:47.921 --> 45:50.626
I've called her.
I haven't talked to her in a week.

45:50.715 --> 45:53.088
I went by her house, she wasn't there.

45:53.551 --> 45:55.093
- She's just upset.
- I know.

45:55.177 --> 45:58.593
Especially when she found out
about the honeys at the Cotton Bowl.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.423
I know! Damn it!

46:02.142 --> 46:05.226
Lord, please forgive me
and my wayward dick.

46:06.937 --> 46:09.013
What the fuck is wrong with you?

46:09.732 --> 46:11.309
I got to make this right.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.772
I cannot lose her over this foolishness.

46:13.861 --> 46:16.944
I love her, and I am so sorry
for what happened, man.

46:17.614 --> 46:18.645
I'm sorry.

46:18.740 --> 46:22.323
Then just say that, man.
Say it. Tell her.

46:23.243 --> 46:26.494
Just tell her, "I'm sorry."

46:27.039 --> 46:28.034
Yeah.

46:33.544 --> 46:34.742
Isaiah 1:18?

46:35.546 --> 46:38.749
Lance, man, you know I can't get down
with the religion.

46:41.927 --> 46:43.171
All right.

46:46.431 --> 46:47.924
- 1:18.
- 1:18.

46:52.853 --> 46:57.015
Okay. "'Come, let's talk this over, '
says the Lord."

46:57.440 --> 46:58.555
My hand.

46:59.317 --> 47:01.889
"No matter how deep the strain
of your sins...

47:01.986 --> 47:05.354
"...I can take it out
and make you as clean as...

47:05.448 --> 47:08.780
"The freshly fallen snow."
Yes, Lord, please take it away.

47:12.453 --> 47:13.616
41:13, Harp.

47:20.585 --> 47:23.206
I think if you just try
to read some of it.

47:23.547 --> 47:25.170
I'm readin' right now.

47:25.423 --> 47:26.703
I'm reading.

47:29.427 --> 47:32.213
- Thank you so much.
- 'Bye. See ya.

47:33.430 --> 47:35.885
I know what you're gonna say, man.

47:36.474 --> 47:39.428
They were throwing panties
at you Teddy Pendergrass style.

47:39.519 --> 47:43.563
You better take notes. You're gonna have
to beat honeys off with a stick soon.

47:43.647 --> 47:46.268
Who, Harp? Hell, no.

47:46.358 --> 47:49.229
Hell, yeah. Once he does Oprah,
it's gonna be on.

47:49.319 --> 47:52.485
Harp ain't never gonna have to work
for the quality ass again.

47:52.571 --> 47:56.521
Panties gonna drop without coercion,
cuddling, caressing. Or...

47:58.619 --> 47:59.863
Or what?

48:00.537 --> 48:03.870
- Or kissin' them on the forehead.
- What?

48:04.040 --> 48:05.849
Harp be kissing the
babes on the forehead.

48:05.850 --> 48:07.658
Panties drop with the quicks.

48:07.752 --> 48:11.831
- Is that true?
- No, man. It doesn't work that way.

48:11.922 --> 48:15.172
- I never did it to get ass.
- Bullshit, nigger. You ain't slick.

48:15.258 --> 48:19.172
- Yeah, nigger, you ain't slick.
- Another secret, Harper?

48:19.345 --> 48:21.409
Honeys love that
sensitive, paternal stuff.

48:21.410 --> 48:23.472
Mia's the same way.

48:24.099 --> 48:25.428
Mia, too?

48:25.851 --> 48:27.310
Here it is right here.

48:27.394 --> 48:29.966
I tried that shit one time.
It didn't work for me.

48:30.062 --> 48:32.767
I guess I ain't as authentic
as old Harp here.

48:37.695 --> 48:40.316
- So?
- So, what?

48:41.364 --> 48:43.273
"So, what?" Mia.

48:43.575 --> 48:45.863
Jordan, good girls never tell.

48:46.076 --> 48:48.152
Bitch, don't make me hurt you.

48:49.455 --> 48:50.653
What?

48:56.628 --> 48:58.703
What we shared was...

48:59.671 --> 49:03.539
as sweet and as endearing
as a forehead kiss.

49:05.176 --> 49:08.675
It was what I needed.
It was what I wanted.

49:09.138 --> 49:11.925
He was a gentleman and a friend.

49:12.516 --> 49:14.888
And I will always love him for that.

49:26.737 --> 49:28.279
It's just tight.

49:30.365 --> 49:34.694
That's cause bohos like you was never
meant to wear fine European tuxedos.

49:35.869 --> 49:39.867
Now, a handsome player like myself,
I'm gonna pimp this baby right here.

49:39.998 --> 49:41.991
You know, I have my own style.

49:43.418 --> 49:44.663
Never mind.

49:44.919 --> 49:46.034
Yeah.

49:48.839 --> 49:51.164
- What's up, dude?
- Mojo's on the prowl again?

49:51.258 --> 49:54.508
And don't stop till the panties
come tumblin' down.

49:55.304 --> 49:58.054
You know how many
single honeys be at weddings?

49:59.223 --> 50:02.094
There's about to be a "hoasis"
in that baby, honey.

50:02.518 --> 50:06.432
That's funny. If you put half the effort
into your future as you do...

50:06.605 --> 50:08.396
Nigger, I am a pimp.

50:08.774 --> 50:11.893
So my future looks mighty bright,
thank you very much.

50:13.111 --> 50:15.981
Is everything straight
for the bachelor party?

50:16.530 --> 50:18.155
Oh, hell, yeah.

50:18.365 --> 50:21.899
Pops gave me the key
to the penthouse suite tonight.

50:21.993 --> 50:25.659
I'm talkin' about this shit
is about to be ignorant, off the hook.

50:26.747 --> 50:28.241
Luke dancers.

50:29.124 --> 50:31.497
Luke dancers.

50:33.295 --> 50:35.252
It's cool. It's cool.

50:35.339 --> 50:39.383
Is your pop still tryin' to groom you
for the hotel management business?

50:41.594 --> 50:43.753
Yeah, for the last 20 years.

50:44.263 --> 50:46.421
I'm just trying not to hear
none of that stuff.

50:46.515 --> 50:49.089
Dealin' with complaining-ass guests...

50:50.727 --> 50:52.885
and unions, payrolls.

50:52.979 --> 50:55.018
Too much like a real job, huh?

50:56.439 --> 50:57.934
Nigger, fuck you.

50:58.609 --> 51:01.774
You're my judge, right?
That's your job. You judge me.

51:01.862 --> 51:03.606
- I'm only playing.
- No, nigger.

51:03.697 --> 51:07.064
It's amazing how you've always
analyzed everybody else's shit...

51:07.158 --> 51:09.614
and you don't do the same thing
for your own self.

51:09.702 --> 51:12.156
- Will you chill?
- No, 'cause you've done dirt, too.

51:12.245 --> 51:13.988
And you're doin' more dirt.

51:14.664 --> 51:17.451
That's right.
You're fuckin' Jordan tonight, remember?

51:17.541 --> 51:18.621
Jordan.

51:20.587 --> 51:23.255
You ain't no better than the rest of us.
Got it?

51:23.338 --> 51:25.212
Your shit just ain't caught you yet.

51:25.299 --> 51:27.256
Everything okay here, fellas?

51:28.260 --> 51:30.086
Cool as a fuckin' fan, cat.

51:32.972 --> 51:34.300
What's goin' on?

51:35.682 --> 51:39.383
Man, nothing. Just, you know, Q.

51:40.854 --> 51:44.554
- I know. You can't change that fool.
- No. What you see is what you get.

51:44.649 --> 51:48.065
At least he's honest, which is more
than I can say for most brothers.

51:48.152 --> 51:49.729
You look nice, man.

51:50.363 --> 51:51.477
Thanks.

52:00.037 --> 52:01.413
You are so bad.

52:01.497 --> 52:04.247
You got a nice smile. Here's my card.

52:04.833 --> 52:06.114
Hey, Quentin.

52:06.835 --> 52:08.413
May I use your phone?

52:12.215 --> 52:14.787
- Who you callin'?
- Shelby.

52:15.426 --> 52:18.380
- Hell, no.
- Excuse me?

52:18.845 --> 52:20.505
I said no, man.

52:21.974 --> 52:25.508
You can't be lettin' her know
your every move. That's played.

52:26.310 --> 52:29.061
- Sometimes you are such an a-hole.
- Well, she's...

52:29.145 --> 52:30.605
Don't you dare.

52:32.107 --> 52:35.641
Come on. You know you don't like
the way she be carrying you.

52:35.986 --> 52:39.152
None of us like it.
It's time for you to just stand up...

52:39.238 --> 52:41.645
grow some balls and be a man.

52:41.740 --> 52:44.491
Look, all I'm trying to say is...

52:44.577 --> 52:47.530
I don't want to see you walkin'
around moping tonight.

52:47.620 --> 52:50.953
It's a bachelor party.
I want to see you have fun, get loose.

52:51.374 --> 52:54.908
Get you a little booty or something.

52:55.670 --> 52:57.792
Then don't even go home to her.

52:58.504 --> 53:00.295
Now you're talkin' crazy.

53:02.342 --> 53:03.622
Trust me.

53:04.969 --> 53:06.511
It works.

53:07.638 --> 53:08.918
You're a family man.

53:09.014 --> 53:11.505
The press loves you.
They'll be dying to see this.

53:11.600 --> 53:15.763
No. This is not a media event. It's
our wedding day. Can you understand?

53:16.562 --> 53:17.891
It's one camera.

53:18.814 --> 53:22.646
Jordan, some things are just sacred,
like between a man and a woman...

53:22.859 --> 53:25.397
I'm sorry. You wouldn't
know nothin' about that.

53:25.487 --> 53:28.689
- Easy, you two.
- My mind's made up. It ain't happening.

53:29.365 --> 53:31.939
- I'm sorry. He's just stressed.
- It's all...

53:32.035 --> 53:33.197
Baby.

53:36.288 --> 53:37.284
What?

53:37.372 --> 53:38.617
Hey, you.

53:41.918 --> 53:44.753
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's great.

53:45.546 --> 53:48.500
Okay. Look at these two.
Ain't they disgusting?

53:53.177 --> 53:54.292
Yeah.

53:55.263 --> 53:58.049
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

53:59.642 --> 54:02.975
- Quentin, can I have a little time?
- Yes, you can.

54:06.772 --> 54:09.939
Why didn't you call me
and tell me how the tuxedos fit?

54:10.401 --> 54:13.686
- Quentin's phone wasn't working, so...
- You guys are wearing Boss?

54:13.779 --> 54:17.147
You couldn't wear an American cut.
It does nothing for your frame.

54:17.240 --> 54:20.989
While we're on the subject,
are you taking the job at the firm?

54:21.828 --> 54:23.736
How was that on the subject?

54:24.080 --> 54:26.785
Hugo Boss. Prestigious law firm.

54:27.666 --> 54:29.077
Need I say more?

54:32.962 --> 54:34.622
Shelby, I just don't know.

54:34.714 --> 54:37.834
You cannot keep babysitting
these ghetto children forever.

54:37.925 --> 54:42.835
- You've got to get a real job.
- I do not want to talk about this now.

54:43.429 --> 54:47.297
I am not going to talk
about this right now.

54:52.771 --> 54:53.803
Nice.

54:59.318 --> 55:02.106
Why did you have to say
anything to her at all?

55:03.781 --> 55:05.025
Because I...

55:06.200 --> 55:07.860
I was curious.

55:08.202 --> 55:09.612
You were curious?

55:11.078 --> 55:13.118
That's cute. You were curious.

55:13.205 --> 55:14.664
Jesus Christ.

55:15.749 --> 55:16.828
Sorry.

55:18.001 --> 55:20.457
There's something else
I want to tell you.

55:20.545 --> 55:24.792
What? Just a little less dramatic,
please, this time. For me.

55:27.469 --> 55:29.591
I wanna make love to you tonight.

55:40.229 --> 55:42.186
I feel like...

55:42.272 --> 55:46.021
our opportunity
has presented itself again.

55:48.152 --> 55:50.822
And I don't want us
to miss out on it twice.

55:52.406 --> 55:55.573
Look, I know this is a bit much, but...

55:56.202 --> 55:58.822
I was just hoping
that you would say yes.

56:06.336 --> 56:09.621
How do you expect me to react
to something like this?

56:10.673 --> 56:14.966
I know. I don't even really know
what I expect right now, but...

56:18.762 --> 56:20.554
I know what I want.

56:21.014 --> 56:23.303
And what I need.

56:24.601 --> 56:28.645
Let's just have our night and we'll see.

56:29.105 --> 56:30.433
You know?

56:36.111 --> 56:38.566
Robin is coming tomorrow.

56:55.878 --> 56:57.871
You know, you don't have to...

56:59.589 --> 57:02.342
You don't have to decide right now.
You...

57:04.803 --> 57:06.262
think about it.

57:16.813 --> 57:18.604
Smack that ass!

57:23.569 --> 57:28.195
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to share this time with us.

57:29.116 --> 57:32.235
We are so overjoyed
that so many of you...

57:32.327 --> 57:35.327
have come from all over
to be here this weekend.

57:36.831 --> 57:38.954
I am so in love with this man.

57:41.877 --> 57:44.961
I wish I could take sole credit
for being swept off my feet...

57:45.046 --> 57:48.795
but Lance certainly played
a major part in that.

57:50.176 --> 57:52.748
And that new contract
didn't hurt, either.

57:52.928 --> 57:54.126
Just kidding.

57:54.221 --> 57:55.419
Yeah, right.

57:56.640 --> 58:00.720
Seriously, none of this would
be possible if it wasn't for...

58:01.728 --> 58:04.681
our friend, our counselor...

58:05.898 --> 58:07.854
the best man, Harper Stewart.

58:15.274 --> 58:16.899
We love you, Harper.

58:31.751 --> 58:33.625
L-Boogie, what's up, baby?

58:36.924 --> 58:38.418
I've been thinkin'.

58:39.176 --> 58:43.389
Listening to Mia, and reading your book
has really made me think, you know?

58:44.891 --> 58:47.429
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I realized something.

58:52.734 --> 58:54.608
I owe you a lot, man.

58:54.903 --> 58:57.394
Mia's right. You kept us together, dog.

59:02.621 --> 59:06.915
- There ain't no need to...
- You could have dogged me out to Mia.

59:07.042 --> 59:08.999
I know how close you two are.

59:09.085 --> 59:11.624
I know sometimes you felt
I didn't deserve her.

59:11.714 --> 59:13.541
Who am I to judge?

59:13.758 --> 59:18.919
Harp, you're everything, man.
I just want to thank you.

59:19.223 --> 59:23.434
And I promise you, I'm gonna make
her happy. I'm gonna be faithful to her.

59:25.063 --> 59:26.557
Well, good.

59:32.071 --> 59:35.190
Man, I can't believe it.
You are getting married.

59:36.326 --> 59:38.283
You know, the ultimate step.

59:38.703 --> 59:41.029
- How do you...
- Harp, I have to, man.

59:41.373 --> 59:44.410
I may be strong in mind and body,
but emotionally I'm weak.

59:44.502 --> 59:48.286
I need Mia in my life.
She's the one who makes me whole.

59:48.422 --> 59:51.459
She's my Earth. She's my queen.

59:54.513 --> 59:56.636
Man, I am so far from that.

59:58.184 --> 01:00:00.094
I mean, Robin is great.

01:00:00.562 --> 01:00:04.014
But is she the woman
I'm supposed to grow old with?

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.607
Here I am.
I'm just startin' to come into my own.

01:00:07.695 --> 01:00:11.693
And I'm just supposed to commit to her?
Do I know how to commit?

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:15.327
- You committed to that book.
- Man, no. No.

01:00:16.455 --> 01:00:19.825
Those were on my own terms. All right?
I had sole control.

01:00:20.334 --> 01:00:23.336
- Lance, you don't understand.
- No, I do understand.

01:00:23.547 --> 01:00:26.252
Let me tell you something.
And I'm not afraid.

01:00:26.384 --> 01:00:29.883
I made God a promise that if He ever
gave me another chance with Mia...

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:31.631
I would do right by her.

01:00:31.722 --> 01:00:36.469
She has forgiven me for
all my indiscretions, man. It's amazing.

01:00:37.187 --> 01:00:39.761
So, if she ever slept
with somebody else...

01:00:44.946 --> 01:00:45.977
What?

01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:49.732
I'd just have to deal with it.

01:00:50.411 --> 01:00:52.783
I wouldn't even question her about it.

01:00:53.289 --> 01:00:55.614
All because of your faith in God?

01:01:04.593 --> 01:01:07.167
Lance, I have to say something to you.

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:08.757
What's up, dog?

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:12.968
Damn! Who locked... Open the door!

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:20.674
Uncle Skeeter, what's happening?

01:01:20.675 --> 01:01:22.738
Man, there are some
fine gals in there.

01:01:23.449 --> 01:01:24.777
Lord have mercy!

01:01:24.867 --> 01:01:27.738
- Why do you want to get married?
- I'm getting married once.

01:01:27.828 --> 01:01:30.451
I won't have five alimony payments
like your broke ass.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.707
I ain't too old to whip your butt.
I ever tell you about Vietnam?

01:01:33.794 --> 01:01:36.795
- I'm gonna go eat.
- I don't blame you. Get your grub on.

01:01:36.964 --> 01:01:38.292
Uncle Skeeter.

01:01:38.967 --> 01:01:40.591
Oh, yo, you!

01:01:40.677 --> 01:01:42.919
What was that you wanted to tell me?

01:01:43.222 --> 01:01:46.556
Oh, nothing. Just congratulations.

01:01:47.393 --> 01:01:49.350
Thanks. I love you, man.

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:56.140
Look here. I don't want you talkin',
lookin', nothin' with the women.

01:01:59.532 --> 01:02:04.194
So are you gonna come over after all
that lap dancing and drinking and stuff?

01:02:07.249 --> 01:02:08.494
Sorry.

01:02:08.834 --> 01:02:11.871
Yeah, I'm gonna call you
when I get back to my crib.

01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:15.258
Look, don't have me
waiting all night, okay?

01:02:15.342 --> 01:02:17.715
Because this is our
night, and I feel it.

01:02:17.716 --> 01:02:20.088
And I know you feel it, too.

01:02:20.598 --> 01:02:22.722
- Jordan, girl, come on.
- I'm coming.

01:02:27.022 --> 01:02:29.513
And I hope you wore those boxers I like.

01:02:31.236 --> 01:02:35.364
You have no idea the amount of ignorant
mess we're about to get into now.

01:02:35.448 --> 01:02:38.865
- Lead the way, dog.
- He got the key. Don't you?

01:02:38.952 --> 01:02:40.696
- That's right, yeah.
- Good.

01:02:41.247 --> 01:02:44.283
- You don't care how I feel.
- Of course I care.

01:02:44.751 --> 01:02:47.538
Are you going to
this juvenile bachelor party?

01:02:47.629 --> 01:02:50.251
Of course I am. And it's not juvenile.

01:02:50.382 --> 01:02:54.048
Come on. You know your
"boys from the hood" would fit right in.

01:02:54.178 --> 01:02:57.132
You really need to stop talking
about my kids like that.

01:02:57.223 --> 01:02:59.346
You need to stay with me tonight.

01:02:59.434 --> 01:03:01.427
There's some unresolved issues
between us.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.771
We should tackle them now
rather than give them time to fester.

01:03:04.857 --> 01:03:07.728
- I'm not gonna do that.
- What am I supposed to do...

01:03:07.819 --> 01:03:11.651
while you're out doing God knows what
with some low-class hoochie mamas?

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.697
That's not really my problem.

01:03:17.455 --> 01:03:19.033
It's not your problem?

01:03:21.251 --> 01:03:23.706
All right, fine. Go.

01:03:24.588 --> 01:03:29.749
Go to your stupid, little boys-only,
bachelor, "rauncherama" shindig.

01:03:29.844 --> 01:03:31.636
I don't care. Just go.

01:03:33.765 --> 01:03:34.880
Go!

01:03:37.561 --> 01:03:38.724
All right.

01:03:39.355 --> 01:03:40.351
Fine.

01:03:43.234 --> 01:03:44.943
See you in the morning.

01:03:45.278 --> 01:03:47.022
Murch! Murch!

01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:00.787
Let's get our freak on!

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:18.393
Gentlemen.

01:04:19.317 --> 01:04:23.150
Welcome to paradise. Have fun.

01:04:23.823 --> 01:04:26.397
Come here, dog.
I gotta give you something.

01:04:28.787 --> 01:04:30.614
Damn. What a view.

01:04:34.043 --> 01:04:37.459
- What's up, man?
- In all the madness, I almost forgot.

01:04:39.758 --> 01:04:42.131
Best man's gotta carry the rings
and the vows.

01:04:42.219 --> 01:04:44.711
Check that out, dog. Five-K platinum.

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:47.805
- It's nice, man.
- Gold is played.

01:04:47.892 --> 01:04:49.802
- Put that away for me.
- Yeah.

01:04:50.562 --> 01:04:53.100
- All right, let's get our drink on.
- Cool.

01:04:53.899 --> 01:04:56.521
I gotta go drain the main vein.

01:04:56.653 --> 01:04:58.941
- Hurry up.
- Catch up with you.

01:05:20.179 --> 01:05:21.674
Let's get our drink on!

01:05:21.806 --> 01:05:24.221
You're being irrational.
I know it's loud.

01:05:24.222 --> 01:05:26.635
There's not one hoochie mama...

01:05:26.729 --> 01:05:28.555
Shelby, there's not!

01:05:29.022 --> 01:05:32.309
Don't hang up again. What are you doing?

01:05:32.902 --> 01:05:34.480
- I'm in this...
- Just drink.

01:05:34.571 --> 01:05:36.445
Hit me one more time.

01:05:37.032 --> 01:05:39.987
- So you about to do your thing tonight?
- Man.

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:42.694
Go ahead on, be a dog, dog.

01:05:43.665 --> 01:05:45.991
To that fat-ass contract I just got.

01:05:47.794 --> 01:05:50.001
And that phat-ass bride-to-be I got!

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:53.166
Money and phat-asses, all right!

01:05:55.845 --> 01:05:57.256
I like you.

01:05:58.056 --> 01:06:00.215
It's on like popcorn!

01:06:10.278 --> 01:06:13.649
We've got some high-paid niggers up
in here tonight.

01:06:13.824 --> 01:06:17.240
- Let me be your cowboy, girl!
- Let's get the party started.

01:06:21.333 --> 01:06:23.242
Wait, this my seat? All this for me?

01:06:23.335 --> 01:06:25.661
It's all for you. They
all Zestily clean...

01:06:25.754 --> 01:06:28.211
so get ready to do something fresh
and exciting.

01:06:28.299 --> 01:06:31.716
- Is this the unlucky man?
- The one they call L-Boogie?

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:34.259
- That would be me, ladies.
- That's him.

01:06:36.267 --> 01:06:39.268
Murch! Wake up, Murch.
You're missing a good show.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:46.560
Ass soft as drugstore cotton.

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:49.776
Motherfucker goin' ape for that shit.

01:06:54.121 --> 01:06:56.328
- You like this, Harp?
- Yeah!

01:06:56.665 --> 01:07:00.035
Damn! I found this girl working
in the post office licking stamps.

01:07:00.128 --> 01:07:01.706
Come here, girl.

01:07:02.421 --> 01:07:03.797
That's my girl!

01:07:10.598 --> 01:07:11.463
Damn.

01:07:15.395 --> 01:07:19.180
- So little time, so much ass!
- Chomp that chocolate ass, Lance.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.731
They're really nice,
but I have someone I want you to meet.

01:07:23.822 --> 01:07:26.313
That is my best man, Mr. Harper Stewart.

01:07:26.825 --> 01:07:29.696
- Right here.
- Mr. Harper, are you ready for this?

01:07:37.713 --> 01:07:39.254
Bite that ass.

01:07:50.268 --> 01:07:51.763
Who's next?

01:07:52.521 --> 01:07:54.182
Yeah, baby!

01:07:54.482 --> 01:07:56.226
He's mine, girl.

01:07:58.612 --> 01:08:00.403
Get that money, girl.

01:08:08.331 --> 01:08:10.074
The party's not over!

01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:12.084
We got more for you.

01:08:12.544 --> 01:08:14.702
Fandango, that's me...

01:08:14.839 --> 01:08:19.050
and Sweet Cheeks are about to bring
you somethin' luscious and sugary.

01:08:19.385 --> 01:08:24.546
So allow me to introduce
the flavor we call Candy!

01:08:35.237 --> 01:08:36.897
Okay, she's with it.

01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:00.466
Watch out now, Wayne.

01:09:01.767 --> 01:09:03.227
Oh, man!

01:09:04.895 --> 01:09:07.600
Good thing his shirt is out
of his pants like that.

01:09:07.691 --> 01:09:09.185
Oh, my God.

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:24.876
Go get him, Candy!

01:09:26.129 --> 01:09:29.580
- Don't be scared, Murch! Calm down!
- Bite it, Murch!

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:37.466
Come on, daddy. Pump Candy.

01:09:40.813 --> 01:09:43.979
Don't be afraid. Let's go, Murch!
What's up, dog?

01:09:44.191 --> 01:09:46.897
Yo, Murch, we got Shelby
on the phone for you.

01:09:49.447 --> 01:09:50.990
Do you love me?

01:09:51.658 --> 01:09:53.984
Oh, yeah, daddy. Candy loves you.

01:10:00.001 --> 01:10:01.460
Shelby who?

01:10:02.838 --> 01:10:04.665
- Go get him, girl.
- Man!

01:10:08.678 --> 01:10:11.430
Oh, man. I'm jealous.

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.970
But what about your boy, Murch?

01:10:17.062 --> 01:10:19.898
Grabbed the old girl
like a 5 year old grabs his mama.

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.643
Yeah. He overdid it tonight.

01:10:21.734 --> 01:10:24.356
Why don't you order up coffee
and make him drink it?

01:10:24.446 --> 01:10:26.605
- I got your back.
- All right, man.

01:10:43.718 --> 01:10:47.467
Candy, come on, girl!
It's time to go get our eat on at IHOP.

01:10:47.556 --> 01:10:50.047
- I'm coming! Hold on.
- Would you hurry up? Damn!

01:10:50.142 --> 01:10:52.598
I told you about hiring
those college girls.

01:10:52.686 --> 01:10:55.059
What? I told you to shut up, didn't I?

01:10:55.148 --> 01:10:58.767
Sit your ass in the back...
Girl, I'll bite it, as hungry as I am.

01:10:59.611 --> 01:11:02.281
I don't mean to bother you.
I really don't.

01:11:04.784 --> 01:11:07.620
I just thought we had a connection
back there, is all.

01:11:07.704 --> 01:11:11.453
Look, baby, it just kind of goes
with the job, you know?

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:15.189
Provide the fantasy.
That's the business.

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:17.710
And I keep my personal
life very separate.

01:11:18.967 --> 01:11:21.505
Oh, right. You have to.

01:11:22.054 --> 01:11:23.382
You have to.

01:11:23.889 --> 01:11:26.346
Please forgive me.
Your show was great.

01:11:26.347 --> 01:11:28.802
Thank you.

01:11:31.105 --> 01:11:33.597
"'Cause if you didn't define yourself
for yourself...

01:11:33.692 --> 01:11:37.144
"...you'd be crunched into other
people's fantasies of you and...

01:11:38.823 --> 01:11:40.234
"...eaten alive."

01:11:44.204 --> 01:11:45.699
What did you say?

01:11:47.917 --> 01:11:50.871
It's just a quote I use
to inspire my students.

01:11:52.755 --> 01:11:54.381
Audre Lorde. I know.

01:11:56.718 --> 01:11:57.750
Yeah.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.591
Me?

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.012
No. You just don't go to sleep.

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:11.684
Yeah, I'm gonna wake your ass up.

01:12:13.071 --> 01:12:14.695
All right, I'm comin'.

01:12:15.824 --> 01:12:16.856
Peace.

"Kacey had cried a river
on Jackson's shoulder that night.

01:12:35.429 --> 01:12:38.384
"Not only were the rumored exploits
of The Ebony Humper...

01:12:38.475 --> 01:12:41.145
"...becoming too commonplace
for her to handle...

01:12:41.562 --> 01:12:44.480

01:13:32.412 --> 01:13:35.496
"But he was responsible
for bringing them together...

01:13:35.624 --> 01:13:38.116
"...and thus accountable for her misery.

01:13:40.713 --> 01:13:43.548
"Nevertheless,
Jackson resisted temptation...

01:13:44.551 --> 01:13:47.387
"...and ignored the desire
screaming within."

01:13:51.225 --> 01:13:53.931
L? I'm about to be out.

01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:55.892
Oh, L.

01:13:56.815 --> 01:14:00.101
I'm about to blow her back out!

01:14:02.029 --> 01:14:03.607
She don't even know.

01:14:04.616 --> 01:14:06.739
She does not know. God.

01:14:08.036 --> 01:14:09.496
Where's that book?

01:14:09.705 --> 01:14:14.035
"Kaceyjust wanted to be held.
And Jackson had to oblige her.

01:14:14.919 --> 01:14:16.414
"So they cuddled...

01:14:16.504 --> 01:14:19.790
"...and though this boundary
probably shouldn't have been crossed...

01:14:19.883 --> 01:14:22.421
"...their bond was made stronger
that night.

01:14:23.263 --> 01:14:26.382
"He was there for her,
and she was comforted.

01:14:32.648 --> 01:14:36.065
"As she slept in his arms,
beautiful and angelic...

01:14:36.569 --> 01:14:41.030
"...Jackson sealed the innocent evening
with a kiss to her frontal lobe."

01:14:43.785 --> 01:14:45.945
Book? Negative.

01:14:49.209 --> 01:14:51.581
Smile, daddy, it's a bachelor party.

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.331
You fucked Mia!

01:14:54.673 --> 01:14:55.836
Oh, shit!

01:14:57.927 --> 01:14:59.718
What the fuck you doin'?

01:15:00.513 --> 01:15:02.139
It's a fight!

01:15:08.731 --> 01:15:13.394
What you doin', man? Shit!
It's just a book! Chill, man.

01:15:14.279 --> 01:15:15.442
No, no, no!

01:15:19.326 --> 01:15:22.743
- Watch out, watch out.
- You gonna hurt that kid.

01:15:23.373 --> 01:15:26.707
"Kissed on the frontal lobe"?
I know what that fucking shit means!

01:15:26.794 --> 01:15:29.285
You supposed to be my boy, motherfucker!

01:15:33.051 --> 01:15:34.545
Get up, bro.

01:15:51.906 --> 01:15:53.945
- Oh, my God!
- What's the matter?

01:15:55.243 --> 01:15:56.406
Oh, my God!

01:15:58.037 --> 01:15:59.746
That fool about to fall.

01:16:00.082 --> 01:16:01.244
Oh, my God!

01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:05.827
Don't leave, okay?

01:16:05.922 --> 01:16:07.672
I'll get you home. I'll
pay for your time.

01:16:07.673 --> 01:16:09.421
Just don't leave.

01:16:11.512 --> 01:16:15.178
- You're reading too far...
- I know how to read between the lines.

01:16:15.516 --> 01:16:19.384
- Oh, my God!
- Now you want God. Ain't that a bitch?

01:16:19.479 --> 01:16:20.677
Yo, L, baby.

01:16:21.815 --> 01:16:23.938
- Tell him.
- What you want, man?

01:16:24.527 --> 01:16:25.558
Please.

01:16:26.363 --> 01:16:28.651
- You really gonna do this?
- Hell, yeah.

01:16:29.490 --> 01:16:30.736
No, you ain't.

01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:34.321
You're gonna marry
a beautiful woman tomorrow.

01:16:35.414 --> 01:16:38.416
A girl that loves you,
and that has only loved you.

01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:39.746
Oh, my God.

01:16:40.503 --> 01:16:42.876
- You ain't throwing all that away.
- He's right.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:45.670
- Listen to Q, Lance.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:16:45.926 --> 01:16:47.551
Okay.

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:51.635
Listen, man.
We know that Harper's a bitch-ass...

01:16:52.684 --> 01:16:57.561
but this cat is your
man, hundred grand.

01:16:58.065 --> 01:17:01.897
He wouldn't do that to you.
Karma don't come back that strong.

01:17:02.404 --> 01:17:04.064
He's right. Q wouldn't lie.

01:17:04.156 --> 01:17:06.148
Even about you bein' a bitch-ass?

01:17:06.241 --> 01:17:09.409
Especially about me bein' a bitch-ass.
Especially that.

01:17:09.996 --> 01:17:11.703
God don't want this, L.

01:17:13.833 --> 01:17:15.992
He don't want this. Pull him up.

01:17:16.795 --> 01:17:18.124
Pull him up.

01:17:49.667 --> 01:17:50.745
Damn.

01:17:55.005 --> 01:17:57.165
The motherfuckin' wedding is off.

01:18:01.514 --> 01:18:03.256
Get the fuck out of here.

01:18:07.603 --> 01:18:10.724
- Please, please, Lance.
- Go to hell, man.

01:18:13.318 --> 01:18:15.228
Go to fuckin' hell.

01:18:18.825 --> 01:18:19.856
Lance.

01:18:42.603 --> 01:18:44.310
Harper, what happened?

01:19:06.838 --> 01:19:07.870
Damn!

01:19:13.346 --> 01:19:14.840
Just a second.

01:19:20.187 --> 01:19:21.646
Jordan, Jordan.

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:29.238
All right, girlfriend, get it together.

01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:39.118
You are really destroying the groove
up in here.

01:19:40.085 --> 01:19:41.116
Sorry.

01:19:43.839 --> 01:19:45.250
You look nice.

01:19:45.842 --> 01:19:47.217
Gee, thanks.

01:19:54.184 --> 01:19:56.937
- So Lance figured it out, didn't he?
- Yeah.

01:19:58.397 --> 01:20:01.518
He figured it out,
promptly beat my ass...

01:20:01.985 --> 01:20:04.559
and called off the wedding.

01:20:06.366 --> 01:20:07.444
What?

01:20:08.409 --> 01:20:09.524
Yeah.

01:20:09.827 --> 01:20:11.452
Was he serious?

01:20:12.497 --> 01:20:15.831
I don't know. Well, he was drunk.

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:18.998
I don't know.

01:20:19.422 --> 01:20:23.206
- Do you want me to get you anything?
- You've done enough.

01:20:23.802 --> 01:20:26.423
You don't seem to understand something.

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:32.014
They would be in marital bliss by the
time the book was supposed to come out.

01:20:32.645 --> 01:20:36.560
But thanks to you, "Miss I Want
An Exclusive," I got my ass whupped.

01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:40.151
I almost got thrown from a fucking
building because of your ass.

01:20:40.237 --> 01:20:42.811
So thank you, Jordan. Thank you!

01:20:43.992 --> 01:20:46.067
And what the fuck is that smell?

01:20:48.747 --> 01:20:52.959
You got some nerve,
blaming me for your skeletons, mister.

01:20:53.169 --> 01:20:57.298
- Jordan.
- I'm not done. You wrote the book.

01:20:57.466 --> 01:21:02.424
You aired your dirty laundry. Though
you tried to disguise it, it was you!

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:06.182
You got me all fired up
saying that my life was empty...

01:21:06.268 --> 01:21:08.675
and we could've been great together.

01:21:08.812 --> 01:21:12.098
- That was you, okay? Not me. You.
- Okay.

01:21:14.777 --> 01:21:17.529
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:21:18.114 --> 01:21:20.522
I know we're both a
little emotional here.

01:21:20.617 --> 01:21:21.946
I'm sorry.

01:21:24.121 --> 01:21:26.114
We're peas in a pod, remember?

01:21:26.207 --> 01:21:30.786
You know, maybe if I had the luxury
of getting my ass whupped...

01:21:31.797 --> 01:21:33.706
I could be calm right now.

01:21:33.799 --> 01:21:36.586
But I have been drinking tequila shots.

01:21:36.677 --> 01:21:39.513
My hormones are raging out of control.

01:21:39.597 --> 01:21:44.011
I'm emotional! I'm horny! And I don't
want to hear about no goddamn peas!

01:21:45.354 --> 01:21:47.098
Fuck you! Good night!

01:21:48.942 --> 01:21:50.519
How about that?

01:21:57.994 --> 01:22:00.152
Can we at least hold each other?

01:22:24.816 --> 01:22:26.975
Welcome to New York La Guardia Airport.

01:22:27.069 --> 01:22:31.280
Baggage claim and ground transportation
are located on the lower level.

01:22:33.076 --> 01:22:37.204
Good morning! You look so handsome.

01:22:39.249 --> 01:22:41.041
Don't worry. I'm not wearing this.

01:22:41.127 --> 01:22:43.962
I didn't want to get my dress wrinkled
on the plane.

01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:46.372
You think I can change at the church?

01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:51.170
- Yeah. What is it? Yeah.
- Are you all right?

01:22:52.056 --> 01:22:54.547
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- Let's get going.

01:22:55.893 --> 01:22:58.467
I sat next to the cutest little girl
on the plane.

01:22:58.563 --> 01:23:00.639
She was just talking my ear off.

01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:04.104
And she sang me this song. I can't...

01:23:05.237 --> 01:23:06.613
Harper, come on.

01:23:10.702 --> 01:23:12.695
Harper, what's wrong with you?

01:23:14.081 --> 01:23:15.576
What's wrong, baby?

01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:17.740
Harper.

01:23:35.397 --> 01:23:36.773
It's okay.

01:23:38.985 --> 01:23:41.143
Come on, baby. Come on, get up.

01:23:44.158 --> 01:23:46.150
Tell me what happened. It's all right.

01:23:53.168 --> 01:23:54.875
Did you sleep with her?

01:23:57.923 --> 01:23:58.836
No.

01:23:59.342 --> 01:24:02.841
But you were going to. You wanted to.

01:24:09.853 --> 01:24:11.810
I am so disappointed in you.

01:24:14.609 --> 01:24:18.358
I know you feel like shit now,
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:24:18.571 --> 01:24:23.448
You compromised yourself,
our relationship and Lance and Mia's.

01:24:25.997 --> 01:24:27.029
I know.

01:24:29.376 --> 01:24:30.953
I'm glad you told me.

01:24:33.631 --> 01:24:35.789
At least now I know
where I stand with you.

01:24:35.883 --> 01:24:39.299
- No, baby. You know that is not true.
- Don't!

01:24:41.473 --> 01:24:43.799
I may not be perfect, but I'm strong.

01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:53.862
I hope you can make this right.
The wedding starts soon.

01:24:53.946 --> 01:24:54.977
How?

01:24:56.741 --> 01:25:00.406
I've been lookin' all over for Lance,
and I cannot find him.

01:25:01.204 --> 01:25:06.163
And even if I was to find him,
how do I convince him to get married?

01:25:06.627 --> 01:25:09.249
I don't know. That's your bag.
I have a plane to catch.

01:25:09.338 --> 01:25:11.497
Wait, Robin. What are you doing?

01:25:14.844 --> 01:25:16.754
- Get off me!
- I need you!

01:25:29.653 --> 01:25:31.362
I cannot do this alone.

01:25:34.701 --> 01:25:36.611
Please don't leave me now.

01:25:46.923 --> 01:25:48.631
Okay, I'll go with you.

01:25:49.343 --> 01:25:53.009
I want to see what's been holding
you back from me all this time.

01:25:55.892 --> 01:25:58.217
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Come on.

01:26:06.279 --> 01:26:07.358
Oh, man.

01:26:13.245 --> 01:26:16.697
Handle your business, baby. Handle it.

01:26:21.046 --> 01:26:22.920
Shelby, I have something...

01:26:23.007 --> 01:26:27.254
Julian, before you say anything, I just
want you to know that I forgive you.

01:26:27.553 --> 01:26:29.048
- You do?
- Yes.

01:26:29.138 --> 01:26:34.181
I know now that you were just succumbing
to that testosterone peer pressure.

01:26:35.104 --> 01:26:39.149
You wanted to be with me last night
and it ate you up that you couldn't.

01:26:39.442 --> 01:26:42.527
It just made sense that
you should continue to suffer...

01:26:42.613 --> 01:26:45.947
and think about the jeopardy
you put our relationship through...

01:26:46.033 --> 01:26:47.860
rather than let you have your way.

01:26:47.951 --> 01:26:49.612
- I have...
- We're out of time.

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.993
I'm sure it can wait
until the reception.

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:53.789
You better get inside.

01:26:57.964 --> 01:27:00.881
Candace! I'm so glad you could make it.

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.168
You look great.

01:27:09.893 --> 01:27:11.637
Candace, this is Shelby.

01:27:12.188 --> 01:27:13.813
Shelby, Candace.

01:27:13.899 --> 01:27:16.473
It's nice to meet you.
How are you doing?

01:27:16.693 --> 01:27:17.938
I'm so sure.

01:27:19.989 --> 01:27:21.982
So, shall I just sit anywhere?

01:27:22.408 --> 01:27:23.784
Sure, yeah.

01:27:24.077 --> 01:27:27.363
Okay. Thanks, Julian.

01:27:28.123 --> 01:27:29.534
No, thank you.

01:27:33.838 --> 01:27:36.590
Who was that pop tart?

01:27:38.927 --> 01:27:41.881
Shelby, it's over.

01:27:42.682 --> 01:27:45.599
I am not the man for you.
And you are not the woman for me.

01:27:45.685 --> 01:27:47.974
So let's just stop fooling ourselves.

01:27:48.063 --> 01:27:52.227
I hope you find what you're looking for,
because that's what I plan to do.

01:27:54.403 --> 01:27:57.025
I have to go. 'Bye, Shelby.

01:28:03.873 --> 01:28:05.996
Don't you think you oughta pick that up?

01:28:06.084 --> 01:28:07.162
What?

01:28:07.502 --> 01:28:08.913
Your bottom jaw.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.501
Q. 'Morning, Shelby.

01:28:12.799 --> 01:28:15.884
- Go to hell!
- I'll probably see you there.

01:28:18.013 --> 01:28:19.556
Where's Lance?

01:28:19.683 --> 01:28:22.173
I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

01:28:23.061 --> 01:28:26.348
- I'm sorry. Robin, Quentin.
- How you doin'?

01:28:26.607 --> 01:28:27.686
Hi.

01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:32.028
- Hi. You must be Robin.
- Hi. My pleasure.

01:28:32.197 --> 01:28:33.442
This is Murch.

01:28:33.656 --> 01:28:36.326
- This idiot don't know where Lance is.
- What?

01:28:37.495 --> 01:28:40.449
That's not good. Not good at all.
What are we gonna do?

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:41.619
- I don't know.
- Something?

01:28:41.707 --> 01:28:42.823
You're not helping.

01:28:42.918 --> 01:28:46.287
- You need to figure something out.
- I'm under stress here.

01:28:49.174 --> 01:28:51.582
It's your fault that all this happened.

01:28:53.096 --> 01:28:54.839
What have you been doin'?

01:28:55.974 --> 01:28:58.596
Lance. Lance! Hey!

01:28:59.436 --> 01:29:03.102
I told you the wedding is off.
I came to tell my parents that I'm out.

01:29:03.191 --> 01:29:06.525
- You ain't doin' that.
- That bullshit ain't working today.

01:29:07.279 --> 01:29:10.399
- Lance, brother. This isn't...
- Why are you even here?

01:29:11.617 --> 01:29:13.575
You got nothing to say to me.

01:29:14.579 --> 01:29:15.777
Yo, L.

01:29:21.211 --> 01:29:23.205
He wouldn't even look at me.

01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:27.760
- Yeah, but you have to make him!
- How am I gonna make him?

01:29:27.844 --> 01:29:31.130
I don't know. Divine intervention.
I don't know!

01:29:31.306 --> 01:29:33.383
Just get in there. Be creative.

01:29:35.102 --> 01:29:38.638
- Divine intervention.
- Hey, you can do this.

01:29:39.775 --> 01:29:41.234
You have to.

01:29:42.319 --> 01:29:43.350
Go.

01:29:50.954 --> 01:29:55.451
Don't do this. You don't wanna do this.
You just need to breathe, relax.

01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:58.082
- Lance, hold on, man.
- Will you hold up?

01:29:58.171 --> 01:29:59.749
Please don't do this.

01:30:03.218 --> 01:30:05.591
Mama, Daddy, I got something
I gotta tell you.

01:30:05.679 --> 01:30:09.464
Wait! Lance, wait.
I gotta tell you somethin'.

01:30:12.228 --> 01:30:14.387
Lance! Pray!

01:30:14.898 --> 01:30:16.310
Wait for a second.

01:30:18.777 --> 01:30:20.107
What'd you say?

01:30:22.031 --> 01:30:23.656
Pray. Pray.

01:30:24.576 --> 01:30:26.984
You want me to beat you
down again, man?

01:30:37.257 --> 01:30:38.835
Pray with me, brother.

01:30:40.303 --> 01:30:42.378
What? What?

01:30:44.515 --> 01:30:47.054
What is it? What is it?

01:30:49.313 --> 01:30:50.938
I should've worn my diamonds.

01:30:51.023 --> 01:30:53.941
No, the pearls are perfect.
You look beautiful.

01:30:54.069 --> 01:30:56.690
- Lord, did I order the right food?
- Yes.

01:30:56.905 --> 01:30:58.814
Something's gonna go wrong.

01:31:00.868 --> 01:31:01.899
Hi.

01:31:06.958 --> 01:31:08.239
Hi, Mia.

01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:14.748
I'm Robin, Harper's girlfriend.

01:31:15.093 --> 01:31:18.378
Oh, Robin, yes! Hi!

01:31:19.305 --> 01:31:23.600
- How are you, my sister?
- I'm fine, but are you all right?

01:31:23.727 --> 01:31:26.053
Because you really look beautiful.

01:31:26.897 --> 01:31:29.139
Thank you. I'm fine.

01:31:32.362 --> 01:31:33.560
I got jitters.

01:31:34.573 --> 01:31:37.575
I mean, I know it sounds silly...

01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:40.445
but if this day isn't perfect...

01:31:41.456 --> 01:31:42.619
Mia!

01:31:43.834 --> 01:31:46.503
Honey, I have something
that I need to tell you.

01:31:46.587 --> 01:31:50.253
And I think that you might want
to sit down for this.

01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:51.665
What is it?

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:55.674
Sometimes I'm really nosy
and I let my job consume me...

01:31:55.848 --> 01:31:57.887
and I don't think sometimes.

01:31:58.016 --> 01:32:01.516
And I know that this whole thing
is probably really my fault.

01:32:01.812 --> 01:32:03.640
Baby, you are scaring me.

01:32:05.108 --> 01:32:06.686
Right. It's Lance.

01:32:07.194 --> 01:32:10.314
- The thing is...
- He's running late.

01:32:11.866 --> 01:32:14.440
- I'm Robin. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

01:32:15.537 --> 01:32:17.115
- Running late?
- Great.

01:32:17.206 --> 01:32:22.710
Yeah. That's what I came in here
to tell you. He's running a little late.

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:26.044
But he's here now. Right, Kendall?

01:32:27.092 --> 01:32:28.503
I mean, Jordan.

01:32:30.054 --> 01:32:32.212
He's here. We're just
trying to make sure...

01:32:32.306 --> 01:32:35.758
And he knows how important
this day is for you.

01:32:36.311 --> 01:32:38.583
Harper told me about last night.
They got

01:32:38.584 --> 01:32:40.854
a little wild at the bachelor party.

01:32:41.191 --> 01:32:43.861
Girl, please, spare me the details.

01:32:43.945 --> 01:32:45.967
I'm sure they were on
their best behavior.

01:32:45.968 --> 01:32:47.989
I'm sure of it.

01:32:51.162 --> 01:32:54.116
So we just have a little C.P.
Time for now.

01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.999
Yeah. C.P.

01:32:57.169 --> 01:32:58.200
Okay.

01:32:59.921 --> 01:33:01.713
But they'll wait for you.

01:33:01.924 --> 01:33:05.792
Yeah, they'll wait for me. It's my day.

01:33:06.262 --> 01:33:08.053
It's all good.

01:33:14.271 --> 01:33:15.896
What scripture, man?

01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:18.683
How about Exodus 20:14?

01:33:19.276 --> 01:33:21.519
Exodus 20:14. Cool.

01:33:25.242 --> 01:33:26.701
"Thou shalt not..."

01:33:32.918 --> 01:33:35.076
"Thou shalt not commit adultery."

01:33:35.296 --> 01:33:37.288
- Damn.
- What's he readin'?

01:33:38.132 --> 01:33:42.130
Look, man, I'm just trying to stop you
from making a big mistake.

01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:45.969
- By running up in my woman?
- Is that what you want to hear?

01:33:46.058 --> 01:33:48.763
- I wanna hear the truth.
- You don't want the...

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:55.479
All you want to hear is that
you're an amazing running back...

01:33:56.153 --> 01:33:58.193
and that your wife-to-be is perfect.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.653
When the truth is, you
could actually use

01:34:00.654 --> 01:34:03.026
some work on your lateral moves and...

01:34:03.912 --> 01:34:05.572
your short yardage.

01:34:06.539 --> 01:34:09.209
And a long, long time ago...

01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:13.247
Mia slept with your best man.

01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:21.174
I could've killed you last night.
You know that? I still could right now.

01:34:22.141 --> 01:34:25.676
You could, man,
but it wouldn't change anything.

01:34:27.814 --> 01:34:31.231
I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:34.529
And I'm sorry, man.

01:34:36.699 --> 01:34:39.321
- I would give you my right arm...
- Fuck that.

01:34:46.252 --> 01:34:49.206
You said yesterday
that you would forgive her.

01:34:49.297 --> 01:34:52.749
- So you calling me a hypocrite?
- You're not being realistic.

01:34:53.344 --> 01:34:56.215
This isn't the Bible.
This is the real world.

01:34:56.555 --> 01:35:00.803
And Mia is as close to perfection
as you're gonna get.

01:35:01.019 --> 01:35:04.851
I guess you got all the answers.
Everything is so fucking logical to you.

01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.518
Come on. You're in a church.

01:35:06.609 --> 01:35:09.943
The answers are fucked wherever you are!
You can't control me.

01:35:10.029 --> 01:35:14.110
I'm not one of your little characters
in one of your little stories, man!

01:35:14.451 --> 01:35:18.449
You can't control this outcome.
You know why? Because you are not God.

01:35:19.498 --> 01:35:22.535
- That's reality, motherfucker!
- Listen to reason.

01:35:37.937 --> 01:35:39.311
I knew.

01:35:41.815 --> 01:35:45.979
I always knew in the back of my mind
that she had been with somebody else.

01:35:46.196 --> 01:35:49.067
But never in a million lifetimes
would I think...

01:35:50.325 --> 01:35:54.075
that you was gonna be that
self-serving, back-stabbing bastard.

01:36:01.046 --> 01:36:02.790
You can hate me forever.

01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:06.009
But not Mia.

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.885
She loves you so much.

01:36:12.852 --> 01:36:15.972
Man, you're staring your ideal woman
in the face.

01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:23.228
You two were made for each other.

01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:28.451
You two fit together.

01:36:32.499 --> 01:36:33.993
She's my Earth.

01:36:36.211 --> 01:36:37.457
She's my queen.

01:36:39.632 --> 01:36:40.878
I know.

01:36:58.863 --> 01:37:00.737
Okay, I'm gonna go get your tux.

01:37:00.823 --> 01:37:02.104
Wait a minute.

01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:05.659
I'm a Christian so I
have to forgive you,

01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:07.907
but that doesn't mean
I have to like it.

01:37:08.749 --> 01:37:09.781
Okay.

01:37:10.251 --> 01:37:13.252
You better find a way to deal
with your issues, too.

01:37:13.337 --> 01:37:15.586
Writing is not gonna
purge you completely,

01:37:15.587 --> 01:37:17.835
so I suggest that you acknowledge Him.

01:37:19.387 --> 01:37:20.418
Him who?

01:37:24.768 --> 01:37:26.178
Okay.

01:37:30.608 --> 01:37:33.692
I feel you, but if I don't get you
into this tux...

01:37:37.241 --> 01:37:39.992
You said you'd get me over that broom.
Remember?

01:37:40.077 --> 01:37:42.366
- I remember.
- Then don't back out on me.

01:37:42.455 --> 01:37:45.207
You recognize His strength.
You respect it.

01:37:47.919 --> 01:37:50.292
Recognize. Respect.

01:37:50.964 --> 01:37:52.044
Okay.

01:39:45.805 --> 01:39:50.800
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today in the sight of God...

01:39:51.686 --> 01:39:55.436
"...to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony."

01:39:57.985 --> 01:40:00.442
The couple have written
their own wedding vows...

01:40:00.530 --> 01:40:03.531
that they'll speak to each other,
and in front of you...

01:40:03.617 --> 01:40:05.740
their family and dear friends.

01:40:09.457 --> 01:40:10.620
Mia?

01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:20.464
"Lance, my friend...

01:40:22.264 --> 01:40:24.470
"...my love, my hero...

01:40:29.146 --> 01:40:31.139
"...loving you is my heart's joy.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:35.900
"It teaches me to be faithful
to my personal truths.

01:40:38.407 --> 01:40:40.614
"As I stand beside you this day...

01:40:41.369 --> 01:40:43.943
"...I offer you the very heart of me...

01:40:45.874 --> 01:40:48.543
"...filled with sacred love...

01:40:49.252 --> 01:40:53.500
"...pure, unconditional and everlasting.

01:40:54.717 --> 01:40:56.876
"For love bears all things...

01:40:57.554 --> 01:41:01.386
"...endures all things
and believes all things.

01:41:01.976 --> 01:41:03.684
"Love never fails.

01:41:05.063 --> 01:41:06.972
"And I do love you, Lance...

01:41:08.608 --> 01:41:10.518
"...mind, body and soul."

01:41:22.415 --> 01:41:23.411
"Mia...

01:41:24.418 --> 01:41:26.957
"...my darling, my love...

01:41:29.132 --> 01:41:31.290
"...as I stand beside you this day...

01:41:32.094 --> 01:41:34.965
"...know that there is nothing greater
than love.

01:41:35.806 --> 01:41:37.431
"For God is love.

01:41:39.810 --> 01:41:42.100
"And having faith in you...

01:41:44.983 --> 01:41:46.940
"...and belief in our love...

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:51.690
"...makes life worth living.

01:41:52.909 --> 01:41:54.452
"And as I stare...

01:42:02.545 --> 01:42:06.591
"As I stare upon your angelic face...

01:42:11.263 --> 01:42:15.392
"...I am made whole today,
a man with a higher purpose.

01:42:16.186 --> 01:42:19.804
"For a woman's virtue
is a man's greatest glory.

01:42:22.318 --> 01:42:24.026
"From this day forth...

01:42:24.695 --> 01:42:28.564
"...we should love one another
as God loves us."

01:42:32.997 --> 01:42:34.540
The rings, please.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:42.455
"By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you...

01:42:42.925 --> 01:42:44.633
"...husband and wife."

01:42:46.345 --> 01:42:48.173
Please, kiss your bride.

01:43:49.668 --> 01:43:52.338
Mia gave me too much credit
for this union.

01:43:53.839 --> 01:43:55.916
I have learned from them...

01:43:57.678 --> 01:44:01.546
what it means to be truly committed
to another person.

01:44:03.017 --> 01:44:05.639
I have learned the importance...

01:44:06.604 --> 01:44:08.348
of seizing the moment.

01:44:09.775 --> 01:44:11.602
Because you can't go back.

01:44:13.321 --> 01:44:16.192
You can never go back.
You have to live for today.

01:44:17.533 --> 01:44:22.529
Not for what was, or could have been.

01:44:25.043 --> 01:44:26.537
And what will be...

01:44:28.546 --> 01:44:30.255
no one can say.

01:44:34.928 --> 01:44:36.258
But sometimes...

01:44:40.101 --> 01:44:42.509
you just have to step out on faith.

01:44:45.357 --> 01:44:46.935
And believe that...

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:51.488
what you have built together
is worth preserving.

01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:58.954
Because when you're made
for each other as much...

01:45:01.125 --> 01:45:02.834
as these two are...

01:45:06.757 --> 01:45:08.335
it's definitely...

01:45:09.677 --> 01:45:11.717
definitely worth preserving.

01:45:22.234 --> 01:45:24.060
So, to the bride and groom.

01:45:27.364 --> 01:45:28.775
Lance and Mia...

01:45:29.659 --> 01:45:30.987
I love you.

01:45:33.246 --> 01:45:35.998
And may God bless this union.

01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:41.709
Cheers.

01:46:02.321 --> 01:46:03.484
Bravo, baby.

01:46:35.943 --> 01:46:38.648
Okay, ladies, who's ready
to catch the bouquet?

01:46:38.738 --> 01:46:41.312
Single females, on the floor. Let's go.

01:46:41.408 --> 01:46:43.365
Mia, are you ready?

01:46:44.995 --> 01:46:46.656
Okay, here we go.

01:46:52.963 --> 01:46:53.912
Bitch.

01:46:54.172 --> 01:46:55.371
Thanks, Mia.

01:46:58.302 --> 01:47:01.637
- All right. You know what comes next.
- Go get your girl.

01:47:01.722 --> 01:47:03.217
Come on out, y'all.

01:47:03.767 --> 01:47:06.055
- Q, you know you want to.
- What?

01:47:06.144 --> 01:47:09.311
Uncle Skeeter, you don't need
to catch this. Sit your butt down.

01:47:09.398 --> 01:47:12.435
Let's see what happens.
Just throw. You never know.

01:47:16.573 --> 01:47:17.653
I did not!

01:47:25.416 --> 01:47:26.911
I'm gettin' you.

01:48:00.832 --> 01:48:02.078
Cut it out.

01:48:02.168 --> 01:48:04.373
Quit acting like you don't like it.

01:48:08.716 --> 01:48:09.914
You like it.

01:48:13.972 --> 01:48:15.550
Say you like it.

01:48:19.938 --> 01:48:21.266
Say you like it.

01:48:22.858 --> 01:48:24.186
Stop it!

01:48:27.321 --> 01:48:29.231
Don't let her get away, dog.

01:48:35.622 --> 01:48:37.200
- Go get her, Q.
- That's scary.

01:48:39.084 --> 01:48:41.001
I think we have to dance.
Care to dance?

01:48:41.002 --> 01:48:42.917
Yes, I'd love to.

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:51.255
Quentin better be careful
before Shelby puts a hurtin' on him.

01:48:53.184 --> 01:48:54.216
Yeah.

01:48:57.356 --> 01:48:58.980
Dance with me?

01:49:00.150 --> 01:49:01.395
You know...

01:49:03.071 --> 01:49:05.644
I just want to talk to you.

01:49:15.126 --> 01:49:17.285
Cut a rug with a war vet, darling?

01:49:18.839 --> 01:49:20.796
Sure, Uncle Skeeter.

01:49:21.007 --> 01:49:22.171
Come on.

01:49:28.475 --> 01:49:31.761
It's been a crazy-ass,
emotional weekend, hasn't it?

01:49:32.646 --> 01:49:35.103
Damn roller-coaster ride.

01:49:38.194 --> 01:49:40.864
Listen, about last night, Jordan.

01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:45.740
I don't want to hear about last night.
If I hear you mention last night...

01:49:45.827 --> 01:49:49.577
I'm gonna call the Enquirer
and tell them everything I know.

01:49:49.833 --> 01:49:51.457
So it's like that?

01:49:51.752 --> 01:49:55.833
Okay, I hear you loud and clear,
Miss Armstrong. Thank you.

01:49:56.924 --> 01:49:58.253
You're welcome.

01:50:06.477 --> 01:50:08.803
I saw you grabbin' for that garter.

01:50:13.193 --> 01:50:14.652
You know what?

01:50:15.695 --> 01:50:17.190
I don't blame you.

01:50:18.241 --> 01:50:20.067
She's a beautiful woman.

01:50:20.868 --> 01:50:22.493
She's the one.

01:50:25.541 --> 01:50:27.082
Just don't blow it.

01:50:34.426 --> 01:50:36.134
I love you, Harper.

01:50:50.653 --> 01:50:53.061
Excuse me, Robin,
I don't mean to interrupt...

01:50:53.155 --> 01:50:55.528
but Uncle Skeeter
did promise me a dance.

01:50:55.617 --> 01:50:59.829
Seeing he's the only available man in
the whole wedding party, I was just...

01:50:59.913 --> 01:51:02.749
Come on, baby girl.
You don't mind, do you, darling?

01:51:02.833 --> 01:51:04.458
No, not at all.

01:51:05.962 --> 01:51:09.248
And besides I think the best man
over there needs you.

01:51:17.392 --> 01:51:20.309
Come on, Uncle Skeeter.
Don't be tryin' to touch my booty.

01:51:20.395 --> 01:51:21.558
No, no.

01:51:43.130 --> 01:51:45.538
Thank you for helping me today.

01:51:47.593 --> 01:51:48.874
You're welcome.

01:51:50.555 --> 01:51:51.883
Great speech.

01:51:55.519 --> 01:51:58.189
- I was moved.
- You know I meant every word...

01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:01.811
every word I said about
preserving what we have, and...

01:52:01.901 --> 01:52:04.571
I don't think that this
is the right time.

01:52:06.156 --> 01:52:09.941
We have a lot to talk about
and it's not gonna be solved overnight.

01:52:11.036 --> 01:52:14.536
- We have to figure out some...
- You know what your problem is?

01:52:15.250 --> 01:52:17.326
You don't live enough for today.

01:52:18.628 --> 01:52:19.874
What?

01:52:21.799 --> 01:52:23.958
For once, just live in the moment.

01:52:30.226 --> 01:52:31.886
Harper, what are you doing?

01:52:31.978 --> 01:52:33.887
At least for a little while.

01:52:42.364 --> 01:52:43.444
Robin...

01:52:47.829 --> 01:52:49.407
will you marry me?

01:52:53.544 --> 01:52:55.002
I love you.

01:52:59.717 --> 01:53:00.832
Please.

01:53:05.767 --> 01:53:06.798
Yeah.

01:53:09.312 --> 01:53:10.640
Whatever, man.

01:54:20.018 --> 01:54:22.094
Come and get it goin' on, y'all.

01:54:22.271 --> 01:54:24.560
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:56:14.650 --> 01:56:16.025
Housekeeping.

01:56:26.747 --> 01:56:29.155
- Damn! I shouldn't have drank!
- What did I do?

01:56:29.250 --> 01:56:32.002
I ain't drinkin' no more liquor!

01:56:33.672 --> 01:56:35.380
Did you touch me?

01:56:36.305 --> 01:56:42.678
