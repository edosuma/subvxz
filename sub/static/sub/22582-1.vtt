00:05.846 --> 00:07.360
Last time, on Enterprise.

00:07.487 --> 00:09.284
There's nothing left.

00:09.407 --> 00:12.843
- No buildings, no trees, no people.
- That's impossible.

00:12.967 --> 00:14.844
There were 3,600 colonists.

00:14.967 --> 00:16.480
The mission's been cancelled.

00:16.607 --> 00:18.723
I can't believe you're letting them
do this to us.

00:18.847 --> 00:21.486
You've waited all your life
to command this ship.

00:21.607 --> 00:24.440
History never recorded the disaster.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.523
Someone violated the Temporal Accord.

00:26.647 --> 00:28.717
Someone who doesn't want
your mission to succeed.

00:28.847 --> 00:31.759
Are you telling me that
Enterprise didn't cause that explosion?

00:31.887 --> 00:34.082
He brought me back 10 months.

00:34.207 --> 00:36.767
But I knew everything I know now.
How is that possible?

00:36.887 --> 00:40.357
The Suliban destroyed that colony.
We're going back to get proof.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.047 --> 00:51.322
Have your ships bring me Archer.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.401
Captain Archer
is no longer aboard Enterprise.

00:56.967 --> 01:00.960
I thought he was smarter than this.
He could have saved all your lives.

01:01.087 --> 01:03.203
It's targeting our warp core.

01:03.327 --> 01:05.795
You're in the 31st century, Captain.

01:06.047 --> 01:09.437
If bringing me here caused this,
then send me back.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.637
I'll take my chances with Silik.

01:12.527 --> 01:14.404
You don't understand.

01:14.527 --> 01:18.042
The time portals have been destroyed.

01:19.207 --> 01:22.995
Everything's been destroyed.
There's no way to send you back.

01:25.007 --> 01:27.202
And now, the conclusion.

01:34.647 --> 01:36.080
He's not on board.

01:37.447 --> 01:40.007
You must have sensors
that can confirm that.

01:40.127 --> 01:41.355
You've lied to me before.

01:41.487 --> 01:44.604
If you don't tell me where he is,
I'll have no alternative but to...

01:44.727 --> 01:47.480
Come see for yourself,
or send your soldiers.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.802
You'll realise I'm telling the truth.

01:51.007 --> 01:53.601
Drop out of warp
and prepare to be boarded.

01:54.727 --> 01:57.480
Security teams
to Docking Ports 1, 2, and 3.

01:57.607 --> 01:58.960
This is Sub-Commander T'Pol.

01:59.087 --> 02:01.442
All security teams
remain where you are.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.000
Are you crazy?

02:03.127 --> 02:05.277
How do we know how many Suliban
are coming aboard?

02:05.407 --> 02:07.045
They could try to take over the ship.

02:07.167 --> 02:09.396
There are 30 armed vessels
surrounding us.

02:09.526 --> 02:12.917
Unless I'm mistaken, their weapons
are still targeting our warp core.

02:13.047 --> 02:14.446
Mr. Reed?

02:20.167 --> 02:22.681
So unless you have
a better suggestion...

02:31.687 --> 02:34.247
It's been a long road

02:37.047 --> 02:39.003
Gettin' from there to here

02:39.127 --> 02:41.925
It's been a long time

02:42.687 --> 02:46.157
But my time is finally near

02:46.487 --> 02:49.877
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:50.847 --> 02:53.680
I will touch the sky

02:54.087 --> 02:57.636
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:57.847 --> 03:00.759
No, they're not gonna change my mind

03:00.887 --> 03:05.165
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

03:05.447 --> 03:08.359
I'm going where my heart will take me

03:08.527 --> 03:12.679
I've got faith to believe

03:13.087 --> 03:15.806
I can do anything

03:15.927 --> 03:19.636
I've got strength of the soul

03:20.327 --> 03:23.205
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:23.327 --> 03:27.525
I can reach any star

03:28.887 --> 03:30.878
I've got faith

03:32.607 --> 03:35.724
I've got faith

03:36.327 --> 03:39.603
Faith of the heart

03:57.007 --> 04:00.602
If this place was destroyed as long ago
as it seems to have been...

04:00.887 --> 04:02.843
then what are you doing here?

04:04.167 --> 04:06.761
You and your watchdog buddies
don't fit in with all this.

04:06.887 --> 04:09.765
You're thinking of time travel
like we're in an H.G. Wells novel.

04:09.887 --> 04:12.242
We're not. It's far more complicated.

04:12.367 --> 04:14.961
- There's no way for you to understand.
- Try me.

04:16.647 --> 04:20.640
Listen, I realise your little utopia
is gone, and I sympathise.

04:21.687 --> 04:23.803
But if you're telling me the truth...

04:23.927 --> 04:27.761
if you've brought me 800 years
into the future, into this future...

04:27.887 --> 04:31.562
- I think I deserve some answers.
- I don't have any answers.

04:31.727 --> 04:33.922
And you're right, I shouldn't be here.

04:34.047 --> 04:37.244
Which means you shouldn't
be here, either. But you are.

04:37.567 --> 04:38.841
We are.

04:40.687 --> 04:43.679
We brought you here
to protect the timeline.

04:45.447 --> 04:47.358
We did quite a job.

04:51.607 --> 04:54.405
- What's wrong?
- It's gone.

04:56.647 --> 04:59.081
- What's gone?
- The monument.

04:59.207 --> 05:03.405
It was right here.
On the same street as the library.

05:04.807 --> 05:08.038
- It was obviously never built.
- Why is that a problem?

05:14.007 --> 05:16.157
- Who did it commemorate?
- Not "who."

05:16.287 --> 05:20.075
- Then what?
- An organisation. The Federation.

05:20.727 --> 05:23.082
It doesn't exist for you, not yet.

05:23.527 --> 05:25.279
But it will?

05:29.487 --> 05:32.923
Fine. Keep your missing monument
to yourself.

05:34.047 --> 05:36.481
Where's this library
you're talking about?

05:36.607 --> 05:40.077
It should be right down there,
if it was ever built.

05:40.207 --> 05:44.439
And even if it was, it'll be of no help.
All the data's stored electronically.

06:00.647 --> 06:03.605
Books, made with paper.

06:04.967 --> 06:07.197
There aren't supposed
to be books here.

06:08.247 --> 06:09.680
Well, there are.

06:09.807 --> 06:12.640
So I suggest we use some of them
to figure out what you did...

06:12.767 --> 06:16.555
to the last thousand years
when you brought me here this morning.

06:52.727 --> 06:56.037
- They haven't been duplicated.
- Is he correct?

06:56.167 --> 06:59.398
- Don't you believe your scanners?
- Is he correct?

06:59.527 --> 07:02.758
- We didn't have time to make a copy.
- Leave her alone!

07:05.807 --> 07:07.479
Lower your weapon.

07:08.487 --> 07:12.082
If we find Captain Archer
aboard this vessel...

07:12.207 --> 07:15.882
you'll all be punished for lying to me.

07:17.407 --> 07:21.116
He's not here, unless he's dead.
But we did find this.

07:25.007 --> 07:26.486
- Where?
- In that lift.

07:26.607 --> 07:28.438
It's an hour old, maybe two.

07:30.927 --> 07:34.681
When I saw him last,
your Captain spoke of...

07:34.807 --> 07:38.482
a Temporal Cold War.
What was he talking about?

07:38.767 --> 07:41.565
Captain Archer believed Crewman
Daniels was from the future.

07:41.687 --> 07:44.406
But if I recall, you killed him.

07:44.687 --> 07:47.121
- What else?
- Nothing else.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.880
There's a temporal signature
in your turbolift.

07:52.007 --> 07:53.759
What do you know of that?

07:53.887 --> 07:57.675
The last time we saw Captain Archer,
he was entering that turbolift.

07:59.367 --> 08:02.200
Perhaps you haven't been lying to me.

08:02.847 --> 08:05.805
You, shut down all com systems
and computer terminals...

08:05.927 --> 08:08.600
with the exception
of Engineering and the Bridge.

08:08.727 --> 08:11.878
Confine all of them to their quarters.
If anyone resists...

08:12.007 --> 08:13.326
Understood.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.044
Under the circumstances...

08:20.167 --> 08:22.761
it would be best to do
what he says, Commander.

08:40.807 --> 08:43.446
- They're three days overdue.
- I told you, Ambassador.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.319
Archer said he was returning
with proof...

08:45.447 --> 08:48.280
that they weren't responsible
for the tragedy on Paraagan II.

08:48.407 --> 08:51.160
You also told me Starfleet
had ordered him to deliver...

08:51.287 --> 08:55.405
Sub-Commander T'Pol and his
medical officer to the Vulcan ship D'kyr.

08:55.527 --> 08:59.805
- They're three days overdue.
- The D'kyr has long-range sensors.

09:00.167 --> 09:02.158
Have they detected Enterprise?

09:02.287 --> 09:04.642
Captain Archer's negligence...

09:04.767 --> 09:07.645
caused the death of 3,000 colonists.

09:07.767 --> 09:11.077
Your superiors instructed them
to return to Earth.

09:11.207 --> 09:14.165
Their mission is over. They haven't
followed those instructions.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.721
You didn't answer
the Commander's question.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.196
Has your ship detected Enterprise?

09:21.287 --> 09:24.597
The D'kyr said they were joined
by a number of other vessels.

09:24.727 --> 09:27.560
- They're no longer within sensor range.
- What kind of vessels?

09:27.687 --> 09:30.520
They were at too great a distance
to identify.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.843
Enterprise has ignored our hails
and defied Starfleet's orders.

09:34.967 --> 09:38.118
I have no choice
but to send the D'kyr in pursuit.

09:38.647 --> 09:41.844
- Jonathan Archer doesn't report to you.
- No, he doesn't.

09:41.967 --> 09:43.844
But Sub-Commander T'Pol does.

09:43.967 --> 09:46.686
And since she would never comply
with his present actions...

09:46.807 --> 09:49.367
I have to conclude that
she's being held against her will.

09:49.487 --> 09:52.240
I know you don't think much
of Archer, Ambassador...

09:52.367 --> 09:54.927
but he is not in the habit
of kidnapping Vulcans!

09:55.047 --> 09:56.196
Fine.

09:57.287 --> 09:58.686
You send your ship.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.879
Whatever Archer's up to,
I'm sure he's got a good reason.

10:02.007 --> 10:03.645
He knows what he's doing.

10:04.807 --> 10:06.286
Does he really?

10:17.287 --> 10:19.960
Have you cycled through
the sub-temporal harmonics?

10:20.087 --> 10:22.317
He's never failed to respond before.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.836
Perhaps he's angry
that we didn't return with Archer.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.605
Archer wasn't on Enterprise.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.719
Why isn't he responding?
I need instructions.

10:30.247 --> 10:33.876
He said to destroy Enterprise
if we couldn't bring him Archer.

10:34.487 --> 10:37.206
We should tow them out of the nebula
and do it now.

10:37.327 --> 10:39.477
The temporal signature,
it changes everything.

10:39.607 --> 10:42.644
If Archer was pulled through time,
we need new instructions.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.359
Where is he?

10:44.487 --> 10:47.320
If he's angry with you,
you'll be punished again.

10:48.567 --> 10:50.717
We should destroy Enterprise.

10:53.567 --> 10:57.276
Have the surgeons prepare.
Then bring me the Vulcan.

11:07.327 --> 11:11.161
I haven't found a single reference
to this Federation you talked about.

11:11.287 --> 11:14.518
- I doubt you will.
- Because that monument wasn't there?

11:14.927 --> 11:16.918
Because you weren't there.

11:17.407 --> 11:20.717
So I disappear one day,
and all history changes?

11:20.847 --> 11:23.919
I've looked through
the 21st and 22nd centuries.

11:24.127 --> 11:27.517
Everything looks right,
up until the Warp 5 program.

11:27.967 --> 11:30.117
After that, nothing looks right.

11:30.527 --> 11:33.519
There were a lot of people involved
in the Warp 5 program.

11:33.647 --> 11:37.435
We didn't bring a lot of people
here this morning. We just brought you.

11:44.567 --> 11:48.003
"The Romulan Star Empire."
What's that?

11:48.127 --> 11:50.243
Maybe you shouldn't be reading that.

11:52.767 --> 11:54.120
I don't get it.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.205
What could I have done
that could have been so important?

11:57.327 --> 12:01.036
It wasn't just you.
It was events you helped set in motion.

12:02.927 --> 12:06.283
This timeline,
the one you say no longer exists.

12:07.247 --> 12:10.762
What can you tell me about it,
if my mission had continued?

12:12.567 --> 12:14.762
It would have led to others.

12:15.847 --> 12:16.882
And?

12:20.647 --> 12:21.762
Okay.

12:22.927 --> 12:26.761
What about this Federation?
Was Earth part of it? Was I part of it?

12:27.487 --> 12:30.559
Silik wanted you, not the data disks.

12:30.807 --> 12:33.037
The people he answered to
were more interested...

12:33.167 --> 12:34.998
in capturing Jonathan Archer...

12:35.127 --> 12:38.563
than in blaming Enterprise
for the destruction of the colony.

12:38.687 --> 12:41.645
They obviously knew
what role you were going to play...

12:41.767 --> 12:43.917
in the months or years to come.

12:44.047 --> 12:46.800
By taking you away
from the 22nd century...

12:46.927 --> 12:49.725
they caused exactly
what I was trying to prevent.

12:50.527 --> 12:52.119
You've lost me.

12:52.247 --> 12:55.683
The only chance I have
of restoring my century...

12:55.807 --> 12:57.763
is by getting you back to yours.

13:00.047 --> 13:03.005
Sounds like you've got
a chicken-or-the-egg problem.

13:04.647 --> 13:07.445
You said your time portals are gone.

13:07.727 --> 13:11.003
All your technology.
There isn't even electricity here.

13:11.847 --> 13:15.237
You going to find a bicycle?
Turn it into a time machine?

13:15.647 --> 13:19.686
Maybe we don't need a time machine.
Do you have your communicator?

13:23.967 --> 13:26.083
- And my scanner.
- May I?

13:26.887 --> 13:30.516
The people the Suliban were working
for came from about 300 years ago.

13:30.647 --> 13:33.525
They couldn't travel through time,
but they did develop a way...

13:33.647 --> 13:37.162
to send back images of themselves,
to communicate through time.

13:37.727 --> 13:39.558
You can't do that with those.

13:39.687 --> 13:43.077
No, it's a little bit more complicated,
but not much.

13:43.207 --> 13:45.243
We learned how to do it in high school.

13:45.367 --> 13:49.201
But we're going to need a few things
that might not be too easy to find.

13:53.807 --> 13:55.399
What are we waiting for?

14:03.567 --> 14:06.081
Where is Archer?

14:06.807 --> 14:08.206
I don't know.

14:09.407 --> 14:12.160
Who are you working with
from the future?

14:13.247 --> 14:14.965
The Vulcan Science Directorate...

14:15.087 --> 14:17.920
has determined that
time travel is impossible.

14:19.687 --> 14:22.918
Does Captain Archer agree
with that opinion?

14:24.127 --> 14:25.799
It's not an opinion.

14:25.927 --> 14:30.398
Does Archer agree
with that determination?

14:31.687 --> 14:36.477
Captain Archer believes Crewman
Daniels comes from the future.

14:37.007 --> 14:39.077
But Daniels is dead.

14:43.607 --> 14:46.485
Captain Archer claims he saw Daniels
two days ago.

14:49.127 --> 14:50.879
Your captain is gone.

14:51.007 --> 14:55.080
Did Daniels take him into the past
or the future?

14:57.047 --> 14:58.639
The Vulcan Science Directorate...

14:58.767 --> 15:02.601
has determined that
time travel is impossible.

15:23.887 --> 15:27.323
I can't be sure, but I think that's copper.

15:29.567 --> 15:31.956
Well done. I need you to unwrap it...

15:32.087 --> 15:35.477
and pound it into small strips
no more than 1 mm thick.

15:57.367 --> 15:58.436
Hello?

16:01.167 --> 16:03.681
Please repeat. I can't understand.

16:06.807 --> 16:08.684
I still can't understand you.

16:08.807 --> 16:11.321
Try modulating the sub-carrier wave.

16:12.087 --> 16:15.284
Malcolm, can you hear me?

16:15.767 --> 16:18.839
Barely. You're going to need
to boost the signal.

16:21.087 --> 16:22.725
- Any better?
- Yeah.

16:23.447 --> 16:26.325
- I thought the com was offline.
- It is.

16:26.447 --> 16:28.517
I'm routing the signal
through the EPS grid.

16:28.647 --> 16:30.842
I can talk to any doorbell on B-Deck.

16:30.967 --> 16:33.845
- Are you all right?
- Same as you, I guess.

16:34.967 --> 16:37.606
- Locked in tight.
- And the others?

16:37.727 --> 16:40.195
I can't get in contact with T'Pol
for some reason.

16:40.327 --> 16:41.965
Hoshi and Travis are on C-Deck.

16:42.087 --> 16:44.965
Any thoughts about how
we're gonna get rid of these Suliban?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.486
One step at a time.

16:46.607 --> 16:48.199
The first thing we need to do...

16:48.327 --> 16:51.205
is figure out how to tap into
the door coms on C-Deck.

16:51.327 --> 16:53.283
I'll get back to you. Sit tight.

16:54.087 --> 16:56.203
I wasn't planning on going anywhere.

17:02.767 --> 17:04.040
Any luck?

17:04.166 --> 17:07.000
I still have the spatial coordinates
of Enterprise...

17:07.127 --> 17:10.278
but without a quantum discriminator
it's going to be very tricky...

17:10.406 --> 17:12.637
to contact the ship
on the same day you left.

17:12.767 --> 17:14.997
I thought you built these things
in high school.

17:15.127 --> 17:18.085
Where quantum discriminators
were on every desk.

17:19.327 --> 17:21.636
Why is the same day so important?

17:21.887 --> 17:24.924
What would be wrong with
making contact a week before I left...

17:25.047 --> 17:26.445
or even a month before?

17:26.567 --> 17:29.843
I made the biggest mistake
in the history of time travel this morning.

17:29.967 --> 17:32.276
I don't intend to make it any worse.

18:14.567 --> 18:17.718
This is Captain Archer.
Can you hear me?

18:18.767 --> 18:22.680
T'Pol, this is Capt. Archer.
Can you hear me?

18:27.247 --> 18:31.126
- I don't think it's working.
- I don't know where he is.

18:31.247 --> 18:33.363
You don't know where who is?

18:34.807 --> 18:36.081
Sub-Commander...

18:36.247 --> 18:39.762
this is Captain Archer.
I'm having trouble understanding you.

18:39.887 --> 18:41.764
Capt. Archer's gone.

18:43.607 --> 18:46.963
A temporal reading in the turbolift.
I don't know where he is.

18:47.247 --> 18:49.807
Daniels brought me to the future.

18:50.607 --> 18:53.519
That's what the temporal reading
was all about.

18:56.447 --> 18:57.766
Are you all right?

19:01.767 --> 19:06.204
Science Vulcan Directorate
has determined that time travel is...

19:08.327 --> 19:09.521
not fair.

19:10.447 --> 19:13.678
Whatever you say.
Just tell me, are you all right?

19:14.367 --> 19:17.962
- We're all confined to our quarters.
- Where are you?

19:18.647 --> 19:20.478
I told you, in my quarters.

19:20.607 --> 19:23.565
No, I mean, Enterprise.
Where's Enterprise?

19:30.327 --> 19:32.443
There's a helix out my window.

19:33.527 --> 19:37.236
T'Pol, listen to me. I need your help.

19:37.727 --> 19:41.766
You're going to have to find a way
to get into Daniels' quarters.

19:41.887 --> 19:43.605
Do you understand me?

19:44.007 --> 19:46.885
You're on the ceiling.
Why aren't you on a monitor?

19:47.007 --> 19:49.157
There's no technology where I am.

19:49.407 --> 19:51.398
I thought you said
you were in the future.

19:51.527 --> 19:55.122
Do you remember when I asked you
to keep an open mind?

19:55.927 --> 19:58.999
- Yes.
- There's a lot more at stake here...

19:59.127 --> 20:01.960
than bringing me back, or the mission.

20:02.327 --> 20:05.285
I need you to listen to me very carefully.

20:06.527 --> 20:08.722
I need you to trust me.

20:15.927 --> 20:17.042
It won't work.

20:17.167 --> 20:20.557
We can only access the decoupling pins
from outside our quarters.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.281
So if we can't pick the locks...

20:23.407 --> 20:25.921
what about the shafts
that house the EPS conduits?

20:26.047 --> 20:27.844
They're adjacent to the air ducts.

20:27.967 --> 20:30.765
They were pretty much blocked off
when the ship was completed.

20:30.887 --> 20:32.525
It'd be too tight a squeeze.

20:32.647 --> 20:36.162
- What's your definition of "too tight"?
- You or I couldn't get through them.

20:36.287 --> 20:38.243
- Maybe a child or...
- Or Hoshi?

20:38.367 --> 20:40.801
It's possible. But it would be difficult.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.399
What do you say, Hoshi?

20:43.527 --> 20:45.518
You willing to give it a try?

20:46.207 --> 20:48.402
Isn't there some other way
that I can help out?

20:48.527 --> 20:52.645
Something that needs translating?
You know how claustrophobic I am.

20:52.767 --> 20:55.600
There's no one else that
can get through those crawl spaces.

20:55.727 --> 20:57.285
Unless we can reach Crewman Naiman.

20:57.407 --> 20:59.443
- She's pretty small.
- There's no time.

20:59.567 --> 21:02.923
If this is going to work,
we need to begin now. Ensign Sato.

21:03.047 --> 21:05.641
How far would I have to go
to get to the Doctor's quarters?

21:05.767 --> 21:07.678
40 meters, maybe 45.

21:07.807 --> 21:11.163
- Then how far to Lt. Reed's?
- It's not that far, Hoshi.

21:11.287 --> 21:13.721
You can do it. We need you to do it.

22:16.327 --> 22:18.443
- Hoshi?
- Good guess.

22:18.567 --> 22:20.603
- How are you holding up?
- Great.

22:20.727 --> 22:23.719
If you don't mind,
I'd just like to get this over with.

22:26.167 --> 22:27.236
Good luck.

23:23.367 --> 23:25.756
Whatever you're about to say,
I don't want to hear it.

23:25.887 --> 23:27.605
Just get me a shirt.

23:33.767 --> 23:36.440
Third dimension, timeline.

23:36.567 --> 23:39.559
Timeline, first, second...

23:42.127 --> 23:45.278
- What are you doing?
- First, third dimension.

23:45.407 --> 23:47.682
Stand up, Vulcan. Up!

23:51.807 --> 23:52.762
No!

23:57.807 --> 23:59.843
No! Stop!

24:11.527 --> 24:13.324
You certainly took your time.

24:13.447 --> 24:17.725
- He had this pressed against my head.
- Had to be sure they were preoccupied.

24:22.367 --> 24:25.404
You positive you're willing to do this?
It could get pretty ugly.

24:25.527 --> 24:28.564
- I'm positive.
- You've got 30 minutes.

24:29.087 --> 24:30.566
Good luck.

24:31.327 --> 24:34.046
If they regain consciousness,
don't hesitate to use these.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.761
- Don't worry.
- Let's go.

26:02.327 --> 26:06.081
Did you think we wouldn't be watching
Daniels' quarters?

26:07.887 --> 26:09.559
I guess I wasn't thinking.

26:12.007 --> 26:15.602
I guess you weren't.
But you should be thinking now.

26:15.727 --> 26:20.005
Thinking about what will happen to you
if you don't answer my questions.

26:20.127 --> 26:23.278
Are you thinking about that, Lt. Reed?

26:24.367 --> 26:27.962
Good. Now tell me what this is.
What does it do?

26:28.647 --> 26:30.160
I don't know.

26:34.407 --> 26:35.965
What does it do?

26:36.647 --> 26:39.957
I don't know. Please!

26:40.607 --> 26:43.963
- Yes?
- I was told to destroy it.

26:44.367 --> 26:47.803
- I don't know what it does.
- Who told you to destroy it?

26:50.807 --> 26:54.117
Captain Archer, before he left.

26:55.007 --> 26:58.966
- He didn't want you to find it.
- And why would that be?

26:59.927 --> 27:02.885
He thought you would use it
to contact someone.

27:03.007 --> 27:05.601
I don't know who. I swear it.

27:09.487 --> 27:12.160
Have the Lieutenant returned
to his quarters.

27:30.007 --> 27:31.122
Ready.

28:06.887 --> 28:08.923
Engineering, how did this happen?

28:09.127 --> 28:10.242
Engineering!

28:18.087 --> 28:19.236
What is it?

28:19.367 --> 28:21.403
The antimatter stream
has been compromised.

28:21.527 --> 28:24.439
- Shut down the warp reactor.
- Our engineers aren't responding.

28:24.567 --> 28:27.479
- I've sent soldiers.
- Keep me informed.

28:55.647 --> 28:56.682
Yes?

28:56.807 --> 28:59.401
These humans are greater fools
than I thought.

28:59.527 --> 29:01.995
They'd rather commit mass suicide
than submit to us.

29:02.127 --> 29:04.561
- Did you correct the problem?
- It's too late.

29:04.687 --> 29:06.564
The reactor's going to breach.

29:07.007 --> 29:08.998
We can't endanger the helix.

29:09.127 --> 29:12.244
Evacuate your soldiers and have
Enterprise towed out of the nebula.

29:12.367 --> 29:15.120
There's very little time.
Will you alert the tractor teams?

29:15.247 --> 29:17.044
You do it. I'm busy.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.687
Is that you? Can you hear me?

30:24.247 --> 30:27.876
- Report, Ensign.
- Antimatter stream's back to normal.

30:28.807 --> 30:31.116
You may have overdone
your pyrotechnic display.

30:31.247 --> 30:34.239
The scorching on the starboard nacelle
is extensive.

30:34.367 --> 30:38.280
I'll try to remember that next time
we have to fake a reactor breach.

30:38.407 --> 30:41.797
Cell Ships, 30 of them.
Thirty-five approaching at high warp.

30:41.927 --> 30:44.202
Maintain your course
and speed, Ensign.

30:47.367 --> 30:50.677
I've tried to reach you.
I've tried for two days.

30:50.807 --> 30:54.197
I did what you told me
but Archer wasn't on Enterprise.

30:54.327 --> 30:57.080
There was some kind
of temporal signature.

30:57.207 --> 30:59.038
I need instructions.

30:59.847 --> 31:03.237
I don't know how to operate this device.
I need your help.

31:05.647 --> 31:09.276
I hear you, but I don't understand.
Repeat what you said.

31:09.407 --> 31:11.682
Please repeat what you said!

31:19.767 --> 31:22.122
I said, you're an ugly bastard.

31:28.927 --> 31:32.397
You try shape-shifting on me, or pulling
one of your chameleon routines...

31:32.527 --> 31:35.280
and I promise you, Silik,
I'll blow your head off.

31:40.287 --> 31:42.198
Has Enterprise left the nebula?

31:42.327 --> 31:45.524
Can you see? I've brought you Archer!
He's here, Archer's here!

31:45.647 --> 31:48.207
- There's no need to punish me.
- Where's my ship, Silik?

31:48.327 --> 31:49.646
They've left. They're gone.

31:49.767 --> 31:52.804
How many Cell Ships
did you send after them? Silik!

31:53.607 --> 31:57.316
- I don't know, 20, 30.
- You're going to call them off...

31:57.807 --> 32:01.766
and then you're going to give me
those data disks back. Now get up.

32:03.687 --> 32:06.281
- My soldiers won't let you leave.
- Shut up.

32:09.607 --> 32:10.642
Get going.

32:15.967 --> 32:19.755
- Hoshi, any sign of the Vulcan ship?
- Not yet.

32:24.727 --> 32:27.366
Hull plating
on the port-aft quarter's down.

32:30.087 --> 32:32.078
Alter course 10 degrees starboard.

32:39.367 --> 32:41.244
They're closing.

32:49.487 --> 32:51.876
The lead ships are overtaking us.

33:07.647 --> 33:11.242
Port hull plating's down.
Ventral plating as well.

33:23.287 --> 33:26.677
- Why'd they stop firing?
- Why waste ammunition?

33:27.727 --> 33:29.604
They have us surrounded.

33:35.807 --> 33:38.116
Are long-range sensors
still operational?

33:41.487 --> 33:43.159
No Vulcan ship.

33:52.727 --> 33:54.877
- Sub-Commander?
- I see them.

33:57.287 --> 34:00.324
Son of a bitch! He did it.

34:08.206 --> 34:10.960
One Cell Ship, approaching aft.

34:13.607 --> 34:15.359
Stand down weapons.

34:16.887 --> 34:18.286
Open a channel.

34:20.407 --> 34:22.716
Enterprise to Suliban vessel.

34:24.527 --> 34:26.085
Go ahead, Enterprise.

34:26.847 --> 34:30.442
- Good to hear your voice, Captain.
- Good to hear yours, too.

34:31.127 --> 34:34.085
I feel like I've been away
for a thousand years.

34:34.726 --> 34:36.126
Is everyone all right?

34:36.246 --> 34:40.559
Lt. Reed suffered some minor injuries,
but he's recovering in Sickbay.

34:41.206 --> 34:43.118
Captain, I'm curious.

34:43.246 --> 34:46.000
Why didn't the other Cell Ships
try to stop you?

34:46.127 --> 34:48.766
I know it's not standard
Starfleet procedure...

34:48.887 --> 34:51.196
but I took a hostage.

34:51.327 --> 34:54.364
By the time he wakes up,
we'll be long gone.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.963
Request permission to dock.

34:58.887 --> 35:00.366
Permission granted.

35:02.447 --> 35:04.722
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

35:04.847 --> 35:07.122
We've joined the Vulcan ship, D'kyr.

35:07.247 --> 35:09.238
It seems that Starfleet
and the High Command...

35:09.367 --> 35:12.598
are eager to discuss
the future of our mission.

35:12.727 --> 35:16.003
While your explanation
of how you obtained these disks...

35:16.127 --> 35:20.439
is somewhat implausible, it's obvious
that Enterprise was not responsible...

35:20.567 --> 35:22.683
for the destruction of the colony.

35:23.207 --> 35:26.404
It may seem somewhat implausible
to you but...

35:26.527 --> 35:28.643
Please allow me to finish, Captain.

35:29.287 --> 35:31.801
In less than a single Earth year...

35:31.927 --> 35:35.886
you've engaged in armed conflicts
with over a dozen species.

35:36.007 --> 35:39.522
You've escalated the conflict
between my people and the Andorians...

35:39.647 --> 35:44.198
which included the destruction
of one of our most sacred monasteries.

35:44.327 --> 35:47.842
You helped 89 Suliban
escape from detention.

35:48.367 --> 35:51.120
You may claim to be
on a mission of exploration.

35:51.247 --> 35:54.478
I, however, consider you reckless
and irresponsible.

35:54.927 --> 35:56.758
A danger to the Quadrant.

35:57.367 --> 35:59.722
Regardless of the evidence
presented here...

35:59.847 --> 36:01.678
I plan to advise
the Vulcan High Command...

36:01.807 --> 36:04.640
not to change its recommendation
to Starfleet.

36:05.647 --> 36:08.286
Enterprise should be recalled.

36:08.807 --> 36:12.322
You guys have wanted to scrub
this mission from day one!

36:12.447 --> 36:15.519
We proved to you that
we didn't kill those 3,600 people...

36:15.647 --> 36:17.239
but you don't want to hear it!

36:17.367 --> 36:19.835
- You're pathetic!
- That's enough, Commander.

36:22.687 --> 36:24.325
No one's more pleased than I am...

36:24.447 --> 36:27.359
that Enterprise wasn't responsible
for the tragedy.

36:27.487 --> 36:30.399
But Ambassador Soval's argument
may be valid.

36:32.047 --> 36:34.967
Starfleet Command
has a difficult decision to make here.

36:38.087 --> 36:41.238
When I was in my early 20s
on a trip to East Africa...

36:41.367 --> 36:44.837
I saw a gazelle giving birth.
It was truly amazing.

36:45.447 --> 36:48.678
Within minutes,
the baby was standing up on its own.

36:49.767 --> 36:53.077
A few more minutes, and it was walking.
Before I knew it...

36:53.207 --> 36:56.961
it was running alongside its mother,
moving away with the herd.

36:58.207 --> 37:00.675
Humans aren't like that, Ambassador.

37:00.847 --> 37:03.680
We may come from the same planet
as those gazelles...

37:03.807 --> 37:06.401
but we're pretty much helpless
when we're born.

37:07.007 --> 37:09.805
It takes us months
before we're able to crawl...

37:10.567 --> 37:13.206
almost a full year before we can walk.

37:13.327 --> 37:15.841
Our deep-space mission
isn't much different.

37:16.527 --> 37:19.997
We're going to stumble,
make mistakes, I'm sure...

37:20.127 --> 37:23.005
more than a few,
before we find our footing.

37:23.127 --> 37:26.278
But we're going to learn
from those mistakes.

37:27.607 --> 37:29.802
That's what being human is all about.

37:31.447 --> 37:33.597
I'm sorry you can't see that.

37:34.087 --> 37:36.317
Your analogy
is very colourful, Captain...

37:36.447 --> 37:40.725
but I question whether it addresses
the consequences of your actions.

37:41.367 --> 37:44.803
The concept of learning from
one's mistakes shouldn't be difficult...

37:44.927 --> 37:48.237
for a Vulcan of your wisdom
to understand, Ambassador.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.561
Our ancestors...

37:49.687 --> 37:52.155
discovered how to suppress
their volatile emotions...

37:52.287 --> 37:54.926
only after centuries of savage conflict.

37:57.367 --> 38:00.086
You spoke of the destruction
of the monastery.

38:00.207 --> 38:03.802
What about the Vulcan listening post
that Captain Archer found there?

38:04.207 --> 38:06.323
I would hope that our people...

38:06.807 --> 38:09.799
have learned from those events,
that using a sacred sanctuary...

38:09.927 --> 38:11.201
to spy on others...

38:11.327 --> 38:14.080
was a dishonourable practice,
to say the least.

38:14.687 --> 38:17.406
I don't wish
to contradict Captain Archer...

38:17.647 --> 38:21.435
but learning from one's mistakes
is hardly exclusive to humans.

38:22.007 --> 38:24.475
Their mission should be allowed
to continue.

38:37.407 --> 38:39.443
The Command Council
will review the evidence...

38:39.567 --> 38:41.797
and listen to what's been said
here today.

38:41.927 --> 38:44.395
I'm sure they'll hear
from the Vulcans, as well.

38:44.527 --> 38:47.405
I'll let you know
as soon as there's a decision.

38:47.527 --> 38:48.926
Good luck, Jonathan.

38:50.847 --> 38:52.121
All of you.

39:08.047 --> 39:09.116
Come in.

39:14.367 --> 39:18.246
I can't be certain, but Crewman Fuller
might have seen me coming in here.

39:18.687 --> 39:20.405
She tends to be discreet.

39:22.647 --> 39:24.160
What can I do for you?

39:27.687 --> 39:29.962
I think you put it over the top.

39:31.207 --> 39:33.357
Forrest said
the others couldn't believe it...

39:33.487 --> 39:35.762
when you went to bat for us,
not to mention that...

39:35.887 --> 39:39.084
- listening post lecture you gave Soval.
- You spoke to the Admiral?

39:39.207 --> 39:42.483
He woke me up in the middle
of the night. Can you believe that?

39:42.647 --> 39:44.638
I assume with good news.

39:46.807 --> 39:49.196
I think you put it over the top.

39:56.487 --> 39:59.763
- I still don't believe in time travel.
- The hell you don't.
