WEBVTT

00:00.117 --> 00:01.625
Previously on Bitten...

00:01.688 --> 00:03.625
I know every wolf in this territory

00:03.703 --> 00:06.004
- and I do not know you.
- Elena, I am your father.

00:06.006 --> 00:10.208
I have been tracking a very
dangerous Russian Mutt.

00:10.210 --> 00:13.211
Sasha Antonov.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.467
I haven't seen you in a long while.

00:16.469 --> 00:18.935
I've been very busy
with my work, sheriff.

00:18.937 --> 00:21.304
Surprised you haven't heard,
I'm not the sheriff anymore,

00:21.306 --> 00:22.673
just Karen now.

00:22.675 --> 00:24.675
- The hell is all this?
- Counterfeiting material.

00:24.677 --> 00:26.309
This is Bucky Durst's stuff.

00:26.311 --> 00:27.511
Isn't he one of us?

00:27.513 --> 00:29.480
- I am guest here.
- Whose guest?

00:29.482 --> 00:31.648
- Up there, big house.
- Stonehaven?

00:31.650 --> 00:33.850
The Russian Pack isn't run on loyalty,

00:33.852 --> 00:35.151
it's run on money.

00:35.153 --> 00:37.854
Those briefcases are not as
full as they used to be.

00:37.856 --> 00:39.022
There is the weakness.

00:39.024 --> 00:40.556
Until you've gone through the Change,

00:40.558 --> 00:42.158
you don't know anything.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.327
The new strength you'll
get, the heightened senses,

00:44.329 --> 00:46.329
all those things need to be mastered.

00:46.331 --> 00:48.131
Probably wouldn't last
one day out on your own.

00:48.133 --> 00:50.966
If Roman lives and he finds out that
you have my blood in your veins,

00:50.968 --> 00:53.669
you have Antonov blood, he will
stop at nothing to kill you.

00:53.671 --> 00:55.805
He wants to destroy every trace of me.

00:55.807 --> 00:57.874
There was a time when I
would've helped you, Roman.

00:57.876 --> 00:59.375
But that time is past.

00:59.377 --> 01:01.343
Who do you think you are, Danvers?

01:01.345 --> 01:02.879
I have your son!

01:02.881 --> 01:04.078
He attacked Elena,

01:04.081 --> 01:06.515
I will not let that go, Roman.

01:06.517 --> 01:08.350
Now you and I will settle this,

01:08.352 --> 01:09.684
and then you're going to go home.

01:09.686 --> 01:12.821
I am taking control of events, Roman.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.366 --> 01:24.733
Are they still in there?

01:24.735 --> 01:25.867
Yeah.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.671
Thirty years of history,

01:29.673 --> 01:31.372
the whole reason for the blood feud

01:31.374 --> 01:32.874
boiled down to one conversation.

01:32.876 --> 01:34.843
Look, Jeremy can't get
Roman to back down

01:34.845 --> 01:36.921
if he doesn't know what's
at the heart of all this.

01:37.063 --> 01:38.696
He needs all the leverage he can get.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.732
Do you think Jeremy
really wants to do this?

01:40.734 --> 01:42.066
What do you mean?

01:42.410 --> 01:44.743
He was ready to hand
over Alexei and Katia.

01:44.883 --> 01:46.750
To wash his hands of
all of the Antonovs.

01:46.752 --> 01:48.552
That was just for show. Okay?

01:48.554 --> 01:52.022
- To get Roman to see we were serious.
- He used them as pawns, Clay.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.391
He wants what's best for you.

01:54.393 --> 01:56.526
For all of us.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.480
I know. But I...

02:02.516 --> 02:04.048
You asked him for help.

02:05.318 --> 02:07.051
He's giving it to you.

02:09.055 --> 02:11.055
Are you saying you don't trust him?

02:14.727 --> 02:18.929
I'm saying that Jeremy's focus
has been on bigger issues.

02:18.931 --> 02:22.466
And I don't agree with
all of his solutions.

02:25.138 --> 02:26.770
Come on, let's go to bed.

02:28.674 --> 02:30.306
No.

02:30.308 --> 02:31.942
I won't be able to sleep.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.857
Thirty years of running.

02:47.859 --> 02:49.992
For one moment of humanity.

02:49.994 --> 02:51.127
Yeah.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.831
It was...

02:55.833 --> 02:58.668
The lowest point of my life.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.803
That was at the heart of all this?

03:03.340 --> 03:04.674
Yeah.

03:06.343 --> 03:07.977
Her name was Natalya.

03:07.979 --> 03:11.847
Natalya Navikev. She
was Roman's daughter.

03:11.849 --> 03:13.649
Because of me, she died.

03:14.686 --> 03:16.686
It was the beginning of the blood feud

03:16.688 --> 03:19.154
that now extends to my children.

03:19.156 --> 03:23.192
All three of them, should Roman
ever find out about Elena.

03:23.194 --> 03:25.127
I can make Roman see reason.

03:27.198 --> 03:28.997
I have his son.

03:28.999 --> 03:31.700
And he has a problem back
home that I can solve,

03:31.702 --> 03:34.136
that will ruin him if
it's not dealt with.

03:38.408 --> 03:40.374
You're taking an enormous risk.

03:40.376 --> 03:44.012
I don't know how to repay you.

03:44.014 --> 03:46.715
My help comes with a price.

03:46.717 --> 03:49.884
Of course. Of course, anything.

03:49.886 --> 03:53.087
When this is over, you and Alexei
and Katia are going to leave.

03:54.890 --> 03:58.025
And you're going to cut off all
contact with Elena forever.

03:58.027 --> 04:00.394
You will also tell her
that getting in touch

04:00.396 --> 04:02.530
was a great mistake on your part.

04:03.733 --> 04:05.566
- Jeremy...
- My Pack has been under attack

04:05.568 --> 04:07.235
since you got here.

04:07.237 --> 04:10.738
And Elena is being torn apart
between her loyalty for us

04:10.740 --> 04:12.405
and the unknown with you.

04:12.407 --> 04:13.974
Your presence

04:13.976 --> 04:16.576
is pulling at the seams of my household,

04:16.577 --> 04:19.245
causing discord between Clay and Elena,

04:19.248 --> 04:21.248
Elena and myself...

04:21.250 --> 04:22.750
And you will leave

04:22.752 --> 04:25.552
before those relationships
are torn apart forever.

04:27.922 --> 04:30.423
You're asking me to break her heart.

04:30.425 --> 04:32.759
And we will help her mend it.

04:32.761 --> 04:34.894
Clay, and Nick, and myself.

04:36.131 --> 04:37.464
We will take care of her

04:37.466 --> 04:39.098
because we're her family.

04:42.603 --> 04:44.470
Now, you and your other two children

04:44.472 --> 04:47.239
will be safe and free.

04:47.241 --> 04:50.509
But in exchange, you will
never see Elena again.

05:28.041 --> 05:31.291
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:46.402 --> 05:48.903
- Good faith negotiations.
- Yes.

05:49.066 --> 05:52.582
But I must come to a
place of your choosing.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.066
Unarmed.

05:55.068 --> 05:59.437
And, you have Konstantin
as your hostage.

05:59.439 --> 06:01.272
No harm is going to come to your son.

06:01.274 --> 06:02.607
I give you my word.

06:02.609 --> 06:05.410
As long as I do what you say.

06:05.412 --> 06:09.780
- It's a dangerous game, Danvers.
- You put me in this position.

06:09.782 --> 06:11.916
You attacked my Pack
members on my territory.

06:11.918 --> 06:13.618
I am giving you a way out of this

06:13.620 --> 06:15.420
that saves face for everyone.

06:17.123 --> 06:19.624
Anything else?

06:19.626 --> 06:22.627
This guy, all your men,
they'll have to stay away.

06:22.895 --> 06:27.089
_

06:28.001 --> 06:34.901
_

06:37.643 --> 06:40.310
What our host says may be true.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.645
Be ready.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.315
- Shall we?
- Is it far?

06:45.317 --> 06:46.517
We have an office right here

06:46.519 --> 06:47.951
where we won't be disturbed.

06:47.953 --> 06:50.453
I'll take you up. Sasha
will be here in a moment.

08:29.251 --> 08:30.583
Sasha's here.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.390
You're certain we won't be interrupted?

08:38.393 --> 08:41.761
The Sorrentinos have owned
this company for years.

08:41.764 --> 08:43.563
They're going to close for the day soon.

08:44.766 --> 08:46.432
Private enough to talk.

08:46.434 --> 08:50.069
And public enough that you
and Roman will stay civil.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.738
Clay will be nearby to make
sure we're not disturbed.

08:54.609 --> 08:57.610
Whatever it takes to get this done.

09:01.448 --> 09:04.150
You sure you can do this?

09:04.152 --> 09:05.484
I have to.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.612
That language is from my past.
It has no place here.

09:35.982 --> 09:38.783
The years have not been kind to you.

09:40.854 --> 09:42.120
Nor you.

09:42.122 --> 09:45.190
Ah, but for me, it's been life's riches.

09:46.526 --> 09:49.627
For you, it's cowardice and lies.

09:50.830 --> 09:52.996
It has hollowed you out.

09:52.998 --> 09:55.132
Let's sit and talk about this like men.

09:55.134 --> 09:57.301
You control everything
about this meeting,

09:57.303 --> 10:01.339
but you will not control what I say.

10:01.341 --> 10:03.140
After 30 years...

10:04.677 --> 10:06.810
No one gets to do that.

10:19.324 --> 10:23.826
Hm! I was wondering if it was
going to be you guarding me next.

10:25.697 --> 10:26.896
Now you know.

10:26.898 --> 10:29.699
You knock me out, bind me in chains.

10:29.701 --> 10:32.034
I must say, it is not five-star service.

10:32.036 --> 10:34.170
You held a knife to my throat.

10:34.172 --> 10:37.039
After that, the welcome
mat got rolled up.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.175
Hm, and no one knows where we are

10:39.177 --> 10:41.844
so there's no chance
of my being rescued.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.181
We just want this over with.

10:47.518 --> 10:51.553
My father and Sasha Antonov
in the same room together.

10:52.991 --> 10:55.691
I would dearly love to
hear that conversation.

10:56.727 --> 10:58.594
You've never met him?

10:58.596 --> 11:00.195
No.

11:00.197 --> 11:03.732
My father's chased him my entire life.

11:03.734 --> 11:07.102
A ghost I was never sure was even real.

11:07.104 --> 11:09.571
What is he like?

11:09.573 --> 11:11.206
What do you think he's like?

11:11.208 --> 11:14.209
Hm, according to my father
he's a liar, a coward,

11:14.211 --> 11:18.079
a man he trusted, who turned
around and betrayed him.

11:18.081 --> 11:20.215
Does that sound like the man you've met?

11:23.921 --> 11:25.887
We've barely even talked.

11:28.292 --> 11:29.924
I gave you a good life.

11:29.926 --> 11:31.626
Made sure you had everything.

11:31.628 --> 11:36.096
And you, it's like you put that
on the floor and pissed on it.

11:36.098 --> 11:39.099
And now you hide behind this
wolf who owes you nothing.

11:39.101 --> 11:41.769
The stench of your
weakness is overpowering.

11:41.771 --> 11:44.605
The blood that you have
spilled to find me,

11:44.607 --> 11:46.240
the lives that you have ruined...

11:46.242 --> 11:48.575
You put all our lives at risk!
I disobeyed you.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.945
I found something more
important than your orders,

11:50.947 --> 11:53.113
than your precious Pack.

11:53.115 --> 11:55.782
It was our Pack! Roman,

11:55.784 --> 11:58.452
Sasha, enough.

11:58.454 --> 11:59.987
We're going to sit down.

12:01.423 --> 12:03.790
I don't expect this day
to end in fellowship.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.259
But there is much at stake here.

12:06.261 --> 12:10.263
Already, blood has been
spilled, on my territory.

12:10.265 --> 12:13.099
And already threats have
been made against my Pack.

12:14.336 --> 12:16.269
That ends today.

12:16.271 --> 12:19.939
Nothing will settle this
except Sasha's life.

12:21.142 --> 12:24.143
It is fair exchange for what he's done.

12:24.145 --> 12:26.145
I know you feel that way.

12:26.147 --> 12:29.648
But I believe that I
have something to offer

12:29.650 --> 12:31.650
that is even more valuable.

12:43.364 --> 12:44.663
Hey.

12:44.665 --> 12:46.632
Just checking in, you okay?

12:46.634 --> 12:48.834
You know, for people who want
to keep their secret hidden

12:48.836 --> 12:50.736
you're not exactly subtle with your art.

12:50.738 --> 12:52.837
Huh!

12:52.839 --> 12:54.672
I think it's understated,

12:54.674 --> 12:56.808
with a hint of whimsy.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.979
Is my dad going to be okay?

13:05.019 --> 13:07.019
Jeremy knows what he's doing.

13:07.021 --> 13:10.187
And Clay is there just in
case anything goes wrong.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.857
And, if Jeremy gets Roman
to drop his vendetta,

13:12.859 --> 13:14.191
what happens to us?

13:15.194 --> 13:18.863
Well, that's up to Jeremy.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.865
My dad wants to stay close to Elena.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.401
And Alexei needs to be
around other wolves,

13:23.403 --> 13:24.736
I get that.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.672
But I don't want to stay here.

13:28.674 --> 13:31.342
Well, it's not really a
decision for me to make.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.344
I mean, what's my life
look like in Bear Valley?

13:33.346 --> 13:37.048
I get a job at a coffee shop?
At a book store?

13:37.050 --> 13:39.350
Do you even allow that?

13:39.352 --> 13:42.052
- Katia.
- I mean, with what I know,

13:42.054 --> 13:45.055
would I even be able to leave the house?

13:45.057 --> 13:48.725
What if I just disappeared?

13:48.727 --> 13:50.060
You wouldn't even know I existed.

13:50.062 --> 13:51.462
I could go to Montreal,

13:51.464 --> 13:53.063
Chicago, New York...

13:53.065 --> 13:54.898
I'd vanish.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.234
Be an anonymous girl in a huge city.

13:58.236 --> 14:00.736
It'd be the safest thing in
the world for everybody.

14:00.738 --> 14:02.072
No, look, Katia,

14:02.074 --> 14:05.075
the safest place is here, trust me.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.743
Well, for now, maybe.

14:07.745 --> 14:09.912
But what happens next?

14:09.914 --> 14:11.914
What happens to me?

14:35.606 --> 14:37.839
Bear Valley Sheriff's office.

14:37.841 --> 14:39.574
Hey, Allison, it's Karen.

14:39.576 --> 14:41.743
How's civilian life treating you?

14:41.745 --> 14:44.279
It's good! Listen, I was wondering
if you could do me a favour.

14:44.281 --> 14:46.281
Sure thing. You name it.

14:46.283 --> 14:48.617
I saw a suspicious character in town,

14:48.619 --> 14:49.985
foreign, Russian I think.

14:49.987 --> 14:53.087
I got his plates, um,
it's probably a rental.

14:55.325 --> 14:56.457
Allison?

14:56.459 --> 14:58.326
I thought you'd retired.

14:58.328 --> 14:59.828
Huh, I have.

14:59.830 --> 15:01.796
You should be on the lake, fishing.

15:01.798 --> 15:03.498
I have been fishing.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.967
Look... I just... I just don't
like the look of this guy.

15:06.969 --> 15:09.504
Okay. Just this once.

15:09.506 --> 15:10.804
What are the plates?

15:10.806 --> 15:13.107
Okay, I'm going to send
them to you right now.

15:17.147 --> 15:19.980
What was your life like, before this?

15:19.982 --> 15:22.816
Before you became a werewolf?

15:22.818 --> 15:24.351
It doesn't matter.

15:26.822 --> 15:28.989
Was it difficult...

15:28.991 --> 15:30.457
to walk away from?

15:30.459 --> 15:32.159
It was easier than lying all the time,

15:32.161 --> 15:34.595
keeping secrets from the
people that I loved.

15:38.467 --> 15:42.001
I didn't have anyone to walk away
from, no brothers, no sisters.

15:42.003 --> 15:44.171
My parents died when I was young, so...

15:44.173 --> 15:46.173
You were an orphan.

15:46.175 --> 15:48.308
That would make it easier.

15:49.478 --> 15:51.344
What do you remember of your parents,

15:51.346 --> 15:54.013
your mother, or your father.

15:54.015 --> 15:55.347
It's none of your business.

15:56.851 --> 15:58.184
Of course.

16:01.189 --> 16:04.156
Growing up I often
wished I was an orphan.

16:05.493 --> 16:09.161
My father could be... forceful.

16:10.364 --> 16:13.332
When I was 16 I dared to eat before him.

16:14.868 --> 16:16.202
It was a mistake.

16:16.204 --> 16:19.205
I was starving, did not think about it.

16:19.207 --> 16:20.539
When I realized what I had done,

16:20.541 --> 16:24.176
I dropped my food and
begged for forgiveness.

16:26.714 --> 16:28.046
What happened?

16:29.583 --> 16:31.883
He smiled and...

16:31.885 --> 16:34.219
Held his hand out for me to shake.

16:34.221 --> 16:37.055
When I obliged he took my hand and...

16:37.057 --> 16:39.390
slammed it on the table.

16:39.392 --> 16:42.393
Then he pulled a knife he
had hidden in his belt

16:42.395 --> 16:45.363
and plunged it right through my hand.

16:47.066 --> 16:49.734
I was stuck there for
the rest of the meal,

16:49.736 --> 16:51.236
unable to eat.

16:51.238 --> 16:54.539
That is who my father is.

16:54.541 --> 16:58.209
That is how he has remained
Alpha for so many years.

17:00.412 --> 17:03.380
Lessons are taught at
the point of a knife.

17:05.617 --> 17:07.416
"Forgiveness"

17:07.419 --> 17:10.220
is not a word my father knows.

17:12.090 --> 17:14.625
What do you have, Danvers?

17:14.627 --> 17:16.760
What can you offer

17:16.762 --> 17:19.061
to help me forgive?

18:10.354 --> 18:11.687
It must be difficult.

18:11.689 --> 18:14.523
The only woman in a world of wolves.

18:14.525 --> 18:17.660
They must always be... after you.

18:18.674 --> 18:19.773
I made my choice.

18:19.775 --> 18:22.909
Hm, mating for life. An unusual choice.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.312
Everyone tells me I'm unique.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.949
I agree. The only female werewolf.

18:28.951 --> 18:31.785
Why is that? Why are you the only one?

18:34.322 --> 18:35.989
Maybe it's my childhood.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.657
Really?

18:37.659 --> 18:41.660
You survived being bitten
because you were an orphan?

18:41.662 --> 18:43.796
No matter how difficult that was,

18:43.798 --> 18:45.498
how does that make you so much stronger

18:45.500 --> 18:47.800
than any other woman who's been bitten?

18:49.337 --> 18:51.971
Jeremy helped me through the Change.

18:51.973 --> 18:55.173
The cost of this feud goes beyond blood.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.175
It goes beyond just pride.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.678
Nothing is more important than pride.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.981
But in a territory as vast as yours,

19:01.983 --> 19:05.350
pride alone is not enough to rouse
the wolves from their dens.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.686
Sometimes a little extra
incentive is needed

19:07.688 --> 19:09.989
to get them to answer your call.

19:09.991 --> 19:12.690
And lately, they have not
all been responding.

19:12.692 --> 19:15.693
What is it you think you know, Danvers?

19:15.695 --> 19:18.196
I know you rule your Pack by fear.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.831
But also with money.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.833
And lately, your
circumstances have changed.

19:21.835 --> 19:24.369
More money is going out
than is coming back in

19:24.371 --> 19:27.372
and the cost of loyalty is increasing.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.041
Your ability to lead is weakening.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.709
To absolve the sins of the past

19:31.711 --> 19:34.512
you're giving me advice
on my leadership?

19:38.018 --> 19:40.384
We have the means to counterfeit money.

19:40.386 --> 19:43.555
If you agree to a truce,
there will be much more.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.556
You think I can be bought.

19:45.558 --> 19:48.392
No, I think you can see the
bigger picture, Roman.

19:48.394 --> 19:50.861
I think you can see beyond this feud.

19:52.398 --> 19:55.199
This will guarantee that
the Navikevs rule Russia

19:55.201 --> 19:59.703
long after the world has forgotten
the name "Sasha Antonov".

20:06.879 --> 20:09.580
Alexei, we're guests here.

20:09.582 --> 20:12.049
You can't just eat all their food.

20:12.051 --> 20:14.751
Well, Nick told me I could
have whatever I wanted.

20:14.753 --> 20:16.419
Nick was just being polite.

20:16.421 --> 20:17.887
Something you should try.

20:17.889 --> 20:19.422
I've got to fill the
time with something.

20:19.424 --> 20:21.391
I can't just wait.

20:21.393 --> 20:22.892
It'll be okay.

20:22.894 --> 20:25.428
What makes you think this
meeting's going to work?

20:25.430 --> 20:26.896
What makes you think it won't?

20:31.403 --> 20:35.237
Imagine if this threat wasn't
hanging over our heads...

20:35.239 --> 20:37.607
We would be able to start
our lives for real.

20:37.609 --> 20:39.909
You sure have a lot of faith in them.

20:42.113 --> 20:43.579
If this doesn't work...

20:45.617 --> 20:47.750
I don't want to run anymore.

20:51.088 --> 20:54.923
The waiting, you know, it's
just driving me crazy. This...

20:54.925 --> 20:57.459
hoping other people will get
us out of this mess and...

20:57.461 --> 20:59.995
It'll work. They'll get it done.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.797
- Well, we've got to do something.
- Like what?

21:02.799 --> 21:05.834
Something! I don't know,
take control for once.

21:07.771 --> 21:10.639
I'm so sick of being on the
sidelines of my own life.

21:21.118 --> 21:23.284
I Really appreciate the favour, Dave.

21:23.286 --> 21:25.853
Not a problem. Anything
for an old partner.

21:25.855 --> 21:28.122
Heard a rumour that you retired, though.

21:28.124 --> 21:31.559
What would I do if I retired?
I'm blue to the bone.

21:31.561 --> 21:33.494
How's Baltimore?

21:33.496 --> 21:35.329
Crime-infested, drug-riddled.

21:35.331 --> 21:37.231
- Same as ever. Uh-huh.

21:37.233 --> 21:39.133
Hey, I'm not surprised
you needed a little help

21:39.135 --> 21:41.401
tracking this guy down.
What do you mean?

21:41.403 --> 21:44.204
The guy's name is Victor Larnov.

21:44.206 --> 21:45.572
Nothing in the U.S.,

21:45.574 --> 21:47.141
but a real nasty record in Russia.

21:47.143 --> 21:49.543
Charged with assault, withdrawn.

21:49.545 --> 21:51.545
Attempt murder, attempt murder,

21:51.547 --> 21:55.916
-Ag assault, all withdrawn.
- A bad guy.

21:55.918 --> 21:57.684
Yup. What the hell's a guy like that

21:57.686 --> 21:59.352
doing in Bear Valley?

21:59.354 --> 22:01.988
Great question. Thanks
for the info, Dave.

22:01.990 --> 22:04.057
Let me know how this goes down.

22:04.059 --> 22:05.392
And hey, be careful.

22:05.394 --> 22:06.726
Yeah, you bet.

22:18.005 --> 22:20.539
Other women have had guides
who were just as experienced

22:20.541 --> 22:22.541
but none of them survived the bite,

22:22.543 --> 22:25.010
physically, or mentally.

22:26.380 --> 22:29.215
What is it about you, Elena Michaels,

22:29.217 --> 22:32.084
that makes you so special?

22:38.391 --> 22:40.892
It is very skilled work.

22:40.894 --> 22:43.228
We Folded a Mutt into our Pack.
He was a counterfeiter.

22:43.230 --> 22:45.396
He made that.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.732
With this.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.906
It is an intriguing proposal, Danvers.

22:55.908 --> 22:59.277
Money, for the life of a Judas.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.584
We'd have to discuss the particulars.

23:07.586 --> 23:08.919
Of course.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.125
Perhaps it is genetic.

23:14.127 --> 23:15.726
What is?

23:15.728 --> 23:20.064
Something in your blood that
helped you survive the Change.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.932
Your mother and your father
were both descended of wolves.

23:22.934 --> 23:24.901
It seems that made a difference.

23:26.572 --> 23:30.073
My parents were doctors. Humans.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.076
I think maybe they were not.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.245
You don't know anything about my family.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.248
I was wondering, why did your
Pack get involved in this feud?

23:38.250 --> 23:41.084
Why not just hand the
Antonovs over to Roman?

23:41.086 --> 23:45.221
Why are you so interested
in their welfare?

23:46.624 --> 23:48.457
This is our territory.

23:48.459 --> 23:50.459
Any blood spilled here is our problem.

23:50.461 --> 23:52.628
It is more than that.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.264
Sasha was hidden for years,

23:54.266 --> 23:56.265
we weren't able to find a trace of him.

23:56.267 --> 23:59.802
Then, suddenly, he risks
everything to come here,

23:59.804 --> 24:02.805
to spend time with... you.

24:02.807 --> 24:04.774
Hiding out here. Why?

24:06.010 --> 24:07.643
For his children.

24:07.645 --> 24:09.812
- To give them a better life.
- Yes.

24:09.814 --> 24:11.947
But for which child?

24:14.118 --> 24:17.319
There were rumours 30
years ago of a baby girl.

24:17.321 --> 24:19.487
Sasha's child.

24:19.489 --> 24:22.124
My father was unable to confirm them.

24:22.126 --> 24:25.127
Then Sasha shows up here.
You defend him.

24:25.129 --> 24:26.995
Risk relationships for him.

24:26.997 --> 24:29.497
The sort of thing you
would do for family.

24:29.499 --> 24:31.199
The sort of thing you would do

24:31.201 --> 24:33.267
for your father.

24:36.139 --> 24:37.672
Do you know, Jeremy,

24:37.674 --> 24:39.808
what is at the heart of this?

24:40.844 --> 24:44.879
What led to three decades of hatred?

24:44.881 --> 24:46.013
Yes.

24:47.350 --> 24:49.217
You know?

24:49.219 --> 24:51.853
This man, this mudak,

24:51.855 --> 24:53.054
killed my daughter.

24:53.056 --> 24:55.323
I didn't kill Natalya.

24:55.325 --> 24:59.861
As surely as if your
hands were on her neck.

24:59.863 --> 25:01.695
But they weren't my hands, Roman.

25:01.697 --> 25:03.163
They were yours.

25:03.165 --> 25:06.533
I asked you to take care of
Natalya when her mother died.

25:06.535 --> 25:08.068
To watch over her.

25:08.070 --> 25:11.872
I knew that I could not risk
being part of her life.

25:11.874 --> 25:15.041
I trusted you to protect her.

25:15.043 --> 25:17.544
- Instead you ruined her.
- I fell in love with her!

25:17.546 --> 25:19.412
She was my daughter!

25:19.414 --> 25:20.747
And you killed her!

25:20.749 --> 25:23.383
She couldn't live after what you did!

25:23.385 --> 25:25.385
You showed her what you are!

25:25.387 --> 25:26.887
What we are!

25:26.889 --> 25:30.090
You left me no choice but
to kill my own daughter!

25:38.867 --> 25:41.868
I'm sure he did not tell
you who your mother was.

25:41.870 --> 25:45.872
I'm sure he did not tell you that
he was responsible for her death.

25:48.910 --> 25:50.710
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:51.745 --> 25:53.578
Sasha doesn't mean anything to me.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.915
His selfishness, his stupidity.

25:55.917 --> 25:57.549
That is why your mother died.

25:57.551 --> 26:01.220
She gasped her last breath
while he stayed hidden...

26:02.423 --> 26:03.755
Enough!

26:03.757 --> 26:05.590
You're right, it was my fault!

26:05.592 --> 26:07.759
I took a reckless chance!

26:07.761 --> 26:10.094
But she was your daughter, my God!

26:10.096 --> 26:12.731
I expected you to...
You left me no choice!

26:12.733 --> 26:15.767
- There was nothing else I could do!
- Of course you had a choice!

26:15.769 --> 26:17.736
You could have let her live!

26:20.941 --> 26:23.909
You could have trusted
her with our secret!

26:25.445 --> 26:27.912
Jeremy, certainly you agree!

26:29.983 --> 26:31.115
No.

26:31.117 --> 26:34.452
That is the one thing
that protects our kind.

26:34.454 --> 26:36.120
Humans can never know our secret.

26:36.122 --> 26:38.122
That's too great a risk.

26:38.124 --> 26:40.124
But my children, Katia and Alexei,

26:40.126 --> 26:42.960
surely they cannot be
punished for my mistake.

26:42.962 --> 26:46.263
My daughter died, you killed her.

26:46.265 --> 26:48.966
And, because of that, you have to pay.

26:48.968 --> 26:51.802
Everyone with a drop
of your blood in them

26:51.804 --> 26:53.136
has to pay!

26:58.277 --> 27:00.677
Roman, it's been over 30 years.

27:02.647 --> 27:04.114
You have to let this go.

27:05.150 --> 27:07.117
She was my daughter.

27:09.154 --> 27:10.687
You're defending a man

27:10.689 --> 27:12.990
who's been running away
from the truth for 30 years

27:12.992 --> 27:15.492
after causing your own mother's death.

27:15.494 --> 27:16.826
- Ugh!
- Stop!

27:19.172 --> 27:21.999
My father is going to kill Sasha today.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.667
Because your mother was my sister.

27:24.669 --> 27:26.836
Roman's daughter.

27:30.841 --> 27:33.376
I'm not a Navikev.

27:33.378 --> 27:34.843
You are.

27:38.516 --> 27:41.217
And you are also an Antonov.

27:44.688 --> 27:46.455
Therefore you must die.

28:53.198 --> 28:54.798
_

29:44.246 --> 29:47.381
Ugh!

29:48.250 --> 29:49.583
Ugh!

30:49.142 --> 30:51.009
Oof!

30:51.011 --> 30:53.478
Ugh! What the hell are you doing here?

30:53.480 --> 30:55.447
- I just want to help.
- Not happening.

30:55.449 --> 30:58.149
My father's in there, something
goes down I have to protect him!

30:58.151 --> 31:00.485
What you need to do is get
the hell out of here.

31:00.487 --> 31:01.820
I can help.

31:01.822 --> 31:03.655
If Roman and his men
find out you're here,

31:03.657 --> 31:05.189
they will kill you.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.160
I'm not going anywhere.

31:19.505 --> 31:22.306
Perhaps you are right, Jeremy.

31:22.308 --> 31:25.643
This sickness has been
infecting me for too long.

31:27.346 --> 31:29.647
Maybe it's time to cut it out.

31:32.318 --> 31:34.694
Are you ready to start
discussing the terms?

31:41.360 --> 31:42.692
Yes.

31:45.364 --> 31:47.164
We've wasted enough time.

31:48.233 --> 31:50.500
Now, we move forward.

31:52.204 --> 31:55.672
_

32:20.231 --> 32:21.563
_

32:24.035 --> 32:25.434
Come here, come here, come here.

32:25.436 --> 32:26.902
Listen, listen!

32:26.904 --> 32:29.571
You watch the entrance.
If you see anything,

32:29.573 --> 32:32.741
- you yell. Got it?
- Yeah.

32:34.912 --> 32:38.179
You stay right here. Don't move.

34:08.502 --> 34:11.369
Danvers, what is going on...

34:30.023 --> 34:31.688
You are right, Danvers.

34:31.690 --> 34:33.858
My Pack means everything to me.

34:33.860 --> 34:36.694
This coward isn't worth it.

34:36.696 --> 34:38.862
But you must vow

34:38.864 --> 34:41.065
to never help him again.

34:41.067 --> 34:42.065
Let him suffer,

34:42.068 --> 34:44.869
outcast and alone for 30 more years.

34:44.871 --> 34:47.371
It's a fitting fate.

34:47.373 --> 34:49.007
You have my word on that.

34:51.177 --> 34:53.077
Then it's time for this to end.

34:53.079 --> 34:54.879
Just like that?

34:54.880 --> 34:56.547
The past needs to be buried.

34:56.549 --> 34:59.250
The future needs to begin.

34:59.252 --> 35:00.451
But not for him.

35:00.453 --> 35:01.718
Ugh!

35:06.892 --> 35:09.026
Argh!

35:26.378 --> 35:29.579
Ga-a-a-ah!

35:42.364 --> 35:44.731
- Move away!
- I can't do that.

35:44.733 --> 35:46.133
Then you have decided!

36:33.613 --> 36:35.246
A-a-a-rgh!

37:02.975 --> 37:04.307
Clay!

37:06.311 --> 37:08.445
- Was that Roman?
- I think so.

37:10.649 --> 37:11.848
What happened?

37:15.987 --> 37:17.454
Roman tried to kill Sasha.

37:17.456 --> 37:18.988
Clay, I need you to hunt him down.

37:18.990 --> 37:20.823
Jeremy, Alexei was here.

37:20.825 --> 37:23.459
He had his first Change and ran off.

37:23.461 --> 37:25.461
Did anyone see him? I don't think so.

37:25.463 --> 37:27.163
Clay, you've got to find him quickly

37:27.165 --> 37:28.497
before someone else does, okay?

37:28.499 --> 37:30.332
Elena, I need you to stay here with me.

37:30.334 --> 37:32.301
Please go get the medikit
out of your car.

37:35.807 --> 37:37.206
Jeremy.

37:37.208 --> 37:39.541
Nick, get Katia out of the house

37:39.543 --> 37:41.377
and out of sight. Jeremy, look,

37:41.379 --> 37:42.645
Alexei is missing.

37:42.647 --> 37:44.480
We've been looking for
him but he's gone.

37:44.482 --> 37:46.214
Don't worry about Alexei,
Clay is on that.

37:46.216 --> 37:48.216
Just get Katia away from
Stonehaven, some place safe.

37:48.218 --> 37:50.352
What's going on, what happened?

37:50.354 --> 37:52.488
I think the Russians
are coming after her.

37:54.024 --> 37:55.991
Call me when you get on the road.

37:59.562 --> 38:01.496
Go grab your things, we're leaving.

38:01.498 --> 38:03.498
What happened, where's
Alexei, where's my father?

38:03.500 --> 38:05.200
I'll find out what's happening
as soon as we get moving.

38:05.202 --> 38:07.169
Just, please, just hurry.

38:16.045 --> 38:18.379
I'm fine, I'm fine, help Jeremy.

38:18.381 --> 38:20.214
- What is she doing here?
- I don't know.

38:20.216 --> 38:22.883
- How did she...
- I don't know!

38:24.220 --> 38:26.187
Let me deal with her, you take Sasha.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.223
Jeremy, I'm so sorry.

38:29.225 --> 38:31.025
You did everything you could.

38:32.228 --> 38:34.628
Okay... I'm okay, Elena.

38:36.532 --> 38:38.365
- I'll be right there.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:40.903 --> 38:42.536
What are you going to do?

38:45.907 --> 38:48.308
I need to find out what she saw.

39:09.318 --> 39:11.685
I thought you said Stonehaven was safe,

39:11.798 --> 39:14.097
being part of the Pack was safe.

39:16.436 --> 39:18.936
I'm taking you someplace safer.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.440
Running and hiding, if I
could make a living at that

39:22.442 --> 39:24.575
I'd have my career figured out.

39:27.779 --> 39:31.114
I didn't think I'd ever
miss living in Dawson City.

40:02.380 --> 40:03.846
Is it done?

40:03.848 --> 40:05.181
No?

40:05.183 --> 40:07.016
It is just the beginning.

40:07.018 --> 40:09.352
Danvers has taken Sasha's side.

40:09.354 --> 40:11.187
He's an enemy to us now.

40:11.189 --> 40:14.857
You left me to fend for myself
and nothing is resolved?

40:14.859 --> 40:17.659
- You survived.
- Argh!

40:17.661 --> 40:19.561
They know where we are. We have to move.

40:19.563 --> 40:21.196
Find another base.

40:21.198 --> 40:23.198
I have a place already.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.702
And what happened to that girl, Elena?

40:26.704 --> 40:28.704
I left her alive.

40:28.706 --> 40:29.905
Why?

40:29.907 --> 40:31.874
You wondered why Sasha was here,

40:31.876 --> 40:34.042
why he's interested in Elena.

40:34.044 --> 40:35.377
I have the answer now.

40:39.216 --> 40:41.616
Alexei!

40:41.618 --> 40:43.318
Alexei!

40:46.423 --> 40:47.555
Alexei...

40:50.226 --> 40:53.027
- Hey, hey, are you all right?
- Clay?

40:53.897 --> 40:55.229
What happened?

40:57.233 --> 40:58.733
I can't remember.

40:58.735 --> 41:02.069
I, uh... there was...

41:02.071 --> 41:04.539
- it was moving.
- What was?

41:05.909 --> 41:07.908
- I don't know.
- Alexei, think hard,

41:07.910 --> 41:09.243
what did you kill?

41:09.245 --> 41:12.413
I was in the forest and
I could smell fear.

41:12.415 --> 41:14.548
And then it was running and...

41:14.550 --> 41:17.918
And I had to chase it. I just...
I just had to.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.753
You smell like gasoline.

41:19.755 --> 41:21.755
And I had to hunt.

41:21.757 --> 41:24.090
And I did, I did it.

41:24.092 --> 41:27.460
I was a wolf!

41:27.462 --> 41:28.595
It was...

41:29.932 --> 41:31.264
It was incredible.

41:35.270 --> 41:38.772
Alexei, this is human blood.

41:38.774 --> 41:40.273
What happened?

41:40.275 --> 41:42.775
Who did you kill?

41:57.458 --> 41:58.657
I've just checked the house,

41:58.659 --> 42:00.059
the Russians haven't been here,

42:00.061 --> 42:01.259
so they're either still coming

42:01.261 --> 42:02.661
or they've changed their plans.

42:02.663 --> 42:04.964
And Katia and Alexei?

42:04.966 --> 42:07.132
Nick is taking Katia to a safe house

42:07.134 --> 42:08.601
and Clay is tracking Alexei.

42:08.603 --> 42:12.471
His first Change.

42:12.473 --> 42:14.139
I should have been there.

42:14.141 --> 42:15.807
Just, stop.

42:15.809 --> 42:17.742
Okay, you need to rest.

42:21.148 --> 42:22.547
Your face.

42:22.549 --> 42:23.748
No, don't.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.766
Are you all right?

42:43.369 --> 42:44.568
Elena?
