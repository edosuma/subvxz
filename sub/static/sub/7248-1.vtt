00:51.384 --> 00:54.054
Please, Luke.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.889
How many cups
have you had this morning?

00:55.930 --> 00:57.390
- None.
- Plus?

00:57.474 --> 00:59.434
Five, but yours is better.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.811
- You have a problem.
- Yes, I do.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.690
- Junkie.
- Angel.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.859
You've got wings, baby.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.655
Luke's. Yeah.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.578
You make that look really good.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.123
It is really good.
It's the best coffee in town.

01:22.206 --> 01:24.834
- Yeah? I'll have to get a cup.
- Good plan.

01:24.917 --> 01:26.377
I've never been here before.

01:26.461 --> 01:29.255
Just passing through
on my way to Hartford.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.591
You're a regular Jack Kerouac.

01:33.134 --> 01:36.929
- Mind if I sit down?
- Actually, I'm meeting someone...

01:37.013 --> 01:38.681
- I'm Joey.
- Okay.

01:39.932 --> 01:41.225
You don't have a name?

01:41.309 --> 01:43.853
I do have a name.
I just am really meeting someone.

01:43.936 --> 01:46.105
So I guess I should get going.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.690
- So soon?
- What?

01:47.773 --> 01:50.610
I'm just screwing with your mind.
It's nice to meet you.

01:50.693 --> 01:54.780
- Enjoy Hartford.
- Enjoy your coffee, mystery woman.

01:55.531 --> 01:56.908
I like that.

01:59.243 --> 02:02.580
- Hey, it's freezing.
- What do you need? Hot tea, coffee?

02:02.622 --> 02:03.956
Lip gloss.

02:06.250 --> 02:09.211
I have vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
and toasted marshmallow.

02:09.252 --> 02:11.589
Anything in there
not resembling a breakfast cereal?

02:11.672 --> 02:15.676
Yes. It has no smell,
but it changes colors with your mood.

02:16.260 --> 02:19.054
- RuPaul doesn't need this much makeup.
- You're crabby.

02:19.138 --> 02:22.224
I'm sorry. I lost my Macy Gray CD,
and I need caffeine.

02:22.266 --> 02:24.101
- I have your CD.
- Thief.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.812
Sorry, and I will get you some coffee.

02:31.192 --> 02:34.153
What? It's not for me.
It's for Rory, I swear.

02:34.236 --> 02:36.363
- You're shameless.
- Look, Officer Krupke...

02:36.447 --> 02:38.991
she's right at that table, right over there.

02:41.076 --> 02:44.121
He's got quite a pair, this guy. Thanks.

02:45.664 --> 02:48.876
- I've never been through here before.
- You have, too.

02:48.959 --> 02:50.586
Hi.

02:50.669 --> 02:53.464
- You really like my table, don't you?
- I was just...

02:53.547 --> 02:55.716
Getting to know my daughter.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.551
Are you my new daddy?

02:59.094 --> 03:01.221
You don't look old enough
to have a daughter.

03:01.305 --> 03:02.556
I mean it.

03:02.639 --> 03:05.726
And you don't look like a daughter.

03:05.851 --> 03:08.812
That's possibly very sweet of you. Thanks.

03:09.271 --> 03:11.732
So, daughter.

03:14.192 --> 03:17.195
- You know, I am traveling with a friend.
- She's 16.

03:17.738 --> 03:19.364
- Bye.
- Drive safe.

04:34.605 --> 04:36.399
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

04:37.025 --> 04:39.569
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

04:40.778 --> 04:43.156
No, I'm sorry. We're completely booked.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.116
We have a wedding party here.

04:45.658 --> 04:48.244
No, there is really nothing I can do.

04:48.619 --> 04:51.164
Yes, I'm sure. Positive.

04:52.039 --> 04:55.585
No, I don't have to look, ma'am.
Yes, of course I'll look.

04:59.589 --> 05:01.716
No, I'm sorry. We're completely booked.

05:01.757 --> 05:03.092
No, don't move.

05:03.175 --> 05:06.846
Just ignore the tiny woman
pushing the 200-pound instrument around.

05:07.013 --> 05:11.017
This is good. I like this.
Maybe after this I'll bench-press a piano.

05:11.225 --> 05:13.686
That's it, lady. Tie your shoe now.

05:13.769 --> 05:15.688
Don't worry. I'll wait.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.107
- Hi, Drella.
- Hi.

05:18.190 --> 05:22.278
I was just wondering,
could you be nicer to the guests?

05:23.237 --> 05:25.573
I'm sorry. Did you not want a harp player?

05:25.614 --> 05:28.534
- Yes, I did.
- Did you not want a great harp player?

05:29.618 --> 05:33.581
- Yes, I did.
- I am a great harp player.

05:33.664 --> 05:35.875
And this is my great harp, okay?

05:35.916 --> 05:38.711
So if you just want someone
to be nice to the guests...

05:38.794 --> 05:41.755
get a harmonica player.
Some guy who whistles through his nose.

05:41.797 --> 05:44.049
Okay? Capisce?

05:44.675 --> 05:48.137
And that is a great spot for a table.
The decorator's a genius.

05:48.429 --> 05:52.016
Madame, you have no idea
how desperately I'd like to help...

05:52.099 --> 05:54.643
but I'd have to build a room
for you myself...

05:54.727 --> 05:56.854
and I'm not a man
who works with his hands.

05:56.937 --> 05:59.022
So the best I can do is suggest...

05:59.064 --> 06:02.651
that you please try for another weekend.
Any weekend.

06:04.278 --> 06:08.448
Good. Fine. The 21st. Hold on, I'll look.

06:10.409 --> 06:12.744
No, I'm sorry. We're completely booked.

06:15.998 --> 06:20.877
- Has the plumber attended to Room 4 yet?
- He was here. He did nothing. It's $100.

06:24.589 --> 06:26.008
Hi, Marco. Lorelai.

06:26.091 --> 06:28.427
Talk to me about Room 4.
What was wrong with it?

06:31.430 --> 06:33.306
I thought you replaced that already.

06:33.390 --> 06:35.809
Because you told me you did.
I never forget anything.

06:35.892 --> 06:37.644
So this one's on you, right?

06:37.727 --> 06:40.105
Pleasure doing business with you.

06:40.272 --> 06:43.358
- What is your offspring doing?
- I need stamps. Can I have these?

06:43.441 --> 06:44.901
- No.
- Take them.

06:44.943 --> 06:46.820
- What's with the muumuu?
- Stop.

06:46.903 --> 06:50.407
You couldn't find one made of metal,
in case anyone has x-ray eyes?

06:50.490 --> 06:52.242
And now we say goodbye.

06:52.325 --> 06:55.120
Have Michel look at your French paper
before you go.

06:55.203 --> 06:56.413
Excuse me?

06:56.496 --> 06:57.914
- That would be great.
- No.

06:57.998 --> 07:01.543
Come on, Michel.
I'll tell all the ladies what a stud you are.

07:01.835 --> 07:04.045
I believe that memo has already been sent.

07:04.087 --> 07:05.338
Please, Michel.

07:05.422 --> 07:08.550
Pretty please with sucre on top?
I will stop talking like this.

07:08.633 --> 07:11.553
Leave it. I'll look at it if I get a chance.

07:11.594 --> 07:15.390
It's due tomorrow.
And pay special attention to the grammar.

07:19.060 --> 07:20.687
I despise you.

07:27.277 --> 07:31.197
When are you gonna let your parents know
that you listen to the evil rock music?

07:31.281 --> 07:33.658
You're an American teenager,
for God's sake.

07:33.741 --> 07:35.451
If my parents still get upset...

07:35.535 --> 07:37.954
over the obscene portion size
of American food...

07:38.037 --> 07:41.332
I seriously doubt I'm going to make
any inroads with Eminem.

07:41.582 --> 07:44.877
- I have to go to that.
- The hayride? You're kidding.

07:44.961 --> 07:47.922
My parents set me up
with the son of a business associate.

07:47.964 --> 07:49.340
He's gonna be a doctor.

07:49.424 --> 07:51.467
- How old is he?
- Sixteen.

07:51.968 --> 07:54.220
So he's gonna be a doctor in 100 years.

07:54.303 --> 07:56.264
My parents like to plan ahead.

07:56.931 --> 08:00.184
- You have to go to the hayride with him?
- And his older brother.

08:00.268 --> 08:04.063
- Now you're kidding.
- Koreans never joke about future doctors.

08:04.313 --> 08:06.274
I guess you're not going?

08:06.315 --> 08:10.111
No. I'm still fuzzy on what's fun
about sitting in the cold for two hours...

08:10.194 --> 08:14.448
- with a bundle of sticks up your butt.
- Don't expect me to clear it up for you.

08:17.702 --> 08:21.622
For those of you who have not finished
the final chapters of Huckleberry Finn...

08:21.706 --> 08:23.791
you may use this time to do so.

08:23.874 --> 08:27.294
For those of you who have,
you can start on your essay now.

08:27.378 --> 08:30.548
Whichever task you choose, do it silently.

08:45.563 --> 08:48.482
- Maybe it's a love letter.
- Or her diary.

08:48.649 --> 08:50.442
Could be a slam book.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.240
It's the assignment.

09:16.176 --> 09:18.262
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

09:19.763 --> 09:22.057
Tell it to the tip jar.

09:22.099 --> 09:23.725
Take the bags up to 314.

09:23.809 --> 09:26.395
Make sure the drapes are closed
and there's extra soap...

09:26.436 --> 09:28.605
and she wants her pillow mints now.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.485
- Sookie!
- I'm okay.

09:33.777 --> 09:37.447
What did you do now?
Why weren't you watching her?

09:37.531 --> 09:38.949
No estabas cuidandola?

09:39.032 --> 09:42.452
No. She's this. Bad food in the head.

09:43.620 --> 09:46.748
- I need you to be more careful.
- I know. I'm sorry.

09:46.790 --> 09:48.708
I fixed the peach sauce.

09:48.792 --> 09:51.545
- That's blood. Why are you bleeding?
- My stitches opened.

09:51.586 --> 09:54.422
I was using too much maple syrup.
It strangled the fruit.

09:54.464 --> 09:57.133
- When did you get stitches?
- Friday night. Radish roses.

09:57.217 --> 09:58.343
Okay, stop moving.

09:58.426 --> 10:01.221
You gotta taste the sauce
while it's still warm.

10:01.263 --> 10:03.974
Sookie, I need you to be more careful.

10:04.057 --> 10:06.893
I need there to be fewer accidents.

10:09.396 --> 10:12.816
Dear God Almighty, that's incredible!

10:12.899 --> 10:15.568
I'll put it on the waffles tomorrow morning
for breakfast.

10:15.652 --> 10:18.238
- I wanna take a bath in that sauce.
- I will make more.

10:18.279 --> 10:22.909
Someday when we open our own inn,
diabetics will line up to eat this sauce.

10:22.992 --> 10:25.078
Won't that be great?

10:25.286 --> 10:29.040
The key to someday achieving that dream
is for you to stay alive long enough...

10:29.123 --> 10:31.417
so we can actually open an inn,
you understand?

10:31.501 --> 10:33.753
- Yes, I understand.
- All right.

10:34.170 --> 10:38.299
Now let's get you up and to the doctor
on three. One, two, three.

10:38.383 --> 10:39.384
What?

10:39.467 --> 10:42.762
Stepped on my thumb. I'm fine.
On three. Okay.

10:44.389 --> 10:47.433
- Was it a good color, at least?
- It had sparkles in it.

10:48.768 --> 10:51.187
And it smelled like bubble gum
when it dried.

10:51.270 --> 10:53.648
There's no way Mark Twain
could compete with that.

10:56.317 --> 10:57.902
Mom, we're home!

10:58.611 --> 11:00.947
- Did you hear something?
- I'm not sure.

11:01.948 --> 11:03.783
Mom, are you here?

11:03.866 --> 11:06.160
We're open. Everything's half off.

11:06.244 --> 11:07.829
We have contact.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.747
- Mom!
- Lane?

11:13.042 --> 11:14.752
Mom, where are you?

11:14.835 --> 11:16.837
- Lane, where are you?
- Back here.

11:17.129 --> 11:18.464
Over here.

11:19.799 --> 11:21.676
I think she's that way.

11:22.051 --> 11:24.845
- Are we closer?
- I'm by the table.

11:26.138 --> 11:27.932
She's kidding, right?

11:28.140 --> 11:30.059
Look, we'll meet you in the kitchen.

11:30.101 --> 11:31.852
- What?
- The kitchen!

11:32.269 --> 11:34.688
- Who's that?
- It's Rory, Mom.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.818
I could hear the disappointment from here.

11:38.901 --> 11:40.361
Come on. Stop it.

11:40.444 --> 11:43.489
It sucks that after all these years
your mom still hates me.

11:43.572 --> 11:46.075
- She doesn't hate you.
- She hates my mother.

11:46.283 --> 11:49.286
- She doesn't trust unmarried women.
- You're unmarried.

11:49.453 --> 11:52.706
I'm hayriding with a future proctologist.
I have potential.

11:52.790 --> 11:57.294
Go upstairs. Tea is ready. I have muffins.
No dairy, no sugar, no wheat.

11:57.378 --> 12:00.339
You have to soak them in tea
to make them soft enough to bite...

12:00.422 --> 12:01.882
but they're very healthy.

12:03.258 --> 12:04.510
How was school?

12:04.593 --> 12:06.720
None of the girls get pregnant, drop out?

12:06.804 --> 12:08.555
Not that we know of.

12:08.722 --> 12:11.767
Though come to think of it,
Joanna Posner was glowing a little.

12:11.850 --> 12:14.269
- What?
- Nothing, Mama. She's just kidding.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.773
- Boys don't like funny girls.
- Noted.

12:18.732 --> 12:20.317
Hello! Anybody here?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.277
We're here. We're coming.

12:22.361 --> 12:24.655
Have the muffins
made from sprouted wheat.

12:24.738 --> 12:26.240
Only good 24 hour.

12:26.281 --> 12:27.783
Everything's half off!

12:27.824 --> 12:29.534
- Where are you?
- Over here!

12:29.618 --> 12:31.453
- Where?
- By the chair!

12:31.495 --> 12:32.871
What chair?

12:33.622 --> 12:35.749
- Careful!
- I'm okay.

12:35.832 --> 12:36.875
Peppers.

12:36.958 --> 12:38.251
Mike.

12:39.294 --> 12:42.672
Hello, little vegetables.
Come with me. I got it.

12:42.756 --> 12:44.925
- Where's my glaze?
- In the counter.

12:44.966 --> 12:47.260
On the counter. On, not in the counter.

12:47.302 --> 12:49.596
Okay, good. All right.

12:49.679 --> 12:52.641
My sauce. That's pretty good.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.269
Hello. A little bit of green. Okay.

12:56.895 --> 12:59.940
Hello, my little babies. You like that?

13:00.023 --> 13:01.650
A little bit of juice.

13:01.733 --> 13:04.569
You're very pretty. Okay.

13:10.951 --> 13:12.994
It's here. It happened. She did it.

13:13.078 --> 13:14.788
I'm gonna need a longer sentence.

13:14.871 --> 13:17.207
The Chilton School. Rory got in.

13:17.749 --> 13:20.335
- Oh, my God!
- I know. Look.

13:20.418 --> 13:24.005
'We are happy to inform you we have
a vacancy at Chilton Preparatory...

13:24.089 --> 13:26.925
'starting immediately.
Due to Rory's excellent credentials...

13:26.966 --> 13:29.260
'and your enthusiastic pursuit
of her enrolment... '

13:29.302 --> 13:31.262
I offered to do the principal to get her in.

13:31.304 --> 13:35.183
'... we'd be happy to accept her once
the first semester's tuition is received. '

13:35.266 --> 13:37.101
This is very exciting.

13:38.811 --> 13:41.981
- Is something burning?
- My bangs. Earlier. Go on.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.193
She can finally go to Harvard
like she's always wanted...

13:45.276 --> 13:48.613
get the education I never got,
and do all the things I never got to do.

13:48.655 --> 13:49.989
Then I can resent her for it...

13:50.073 --> 13:53.951
and we can finally have
a normal mother-daughter relationship.

13:54.827 --> 13:55.912
Mom?

14:00.375 --> 14:01.876
- You're happy.
- Yeah.

14:02.835 --> 14:05.755
- Did you do something slutty?
- I'm not that happy.

14:07.799 --> 14:08.925
Here.

14:08.966 --> 14:11.010
- What's going on?
- Open it.

14:14.263 --> 14:18.059
- I'm gonna be in a Britney Spears video?
- You're going to Chilton! Sorry.

14:18.142 --> 14:19.185
Mom?

14:19.644 --> 14:21.854
You did it, babe. You got in.

14:22.688 --> 14:26.150
How did this happen?
You didn't with the principal, did you?

14:26.233 --> 14:27.735
No. That was a joke.

14:27.818 --> 14:30.446
They have an open spot.
You're gonna start on Monday.

14:30.529 --> 14:32.114
- Really?
- Really.

14:32.323 --> 14:35.618
I don't believe this.
My God, I'm going to Chilton?

14:36.577 --> 14:37.995
Sookie, I'm going to Chilton!

14:38.079 --> 14:40.581
I'll make cookies.
Protestants love oatmeal.

14:40.664 --> 14:42.416
I have to call Lane.

14:44.627 --> 14:46.962
- I love you.
- I love you.

14:50.424 --> 14:51.926
My girl's going to Chilton.

14:51.967 --> 14:54.303
Yeah, I know. Rory's going to Chilton!

15:13.989 --> 15:15.365
Michel, the phone.

15:16.408 --> 15:17.659
It rings.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.871
- Can you answer it?
- No.

15:21.205 --> 15:25.125
People are particularly stupid today.
I can't talk to any more of them.

15:25.667 --> 15:30.339
You know who's really nice to talk to?
The people at the unemployment agency.

15:32.174 --> 15:34.635
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

15:36.094 --> 15:38.430
No, I'm sorry, we're completely booked.

15:38.972 --> 15:42.893
I'm holding for Miss Bell.
I've been trying to get ahold of her all day.

15:43.185 --> 15:44.770
Lorelai Gilmore.

15:47.898 --> 15:49.107
Hi.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.445
Yeah, my daughter Rory
has just been accepted.

15:54.613 --> 15:55.614
Thank you.

15:55.697 --> 15:58.909
And I got the invoice
for your enrolment fee.

15:59.409 --> 16:02.412
That is a lot of zeroes behind that five.

16:04.956 --> 16:07.959
Okay, I guess what I'm wondering is...

16:08.043 --> 16:11.588
if you couldn't take, say, part of it now,
just to get her going?

16:15.133 --> 16:18.011
But she's supposed to start Monday.

16:18.094 --> 16:21.264
It just doesn't give me a lot of time
to pull a bank job.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.434
Never mind. I was just kidding.

16:24.601 --> 16:27.062
No, a bank job is robbing a bank, but...

16:32.901 --> 16:36.488
No. I don't want you to give up her space.

16:37.655 --> 16:39.782
I'll have to figure it out.

16:41.534 --> 16:45.622
Okay. No, thank you.
It's been a real treat talking to you.

16:46.789 --> 16:48.249
Yeah. Bye-bye.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.345
What do I do?

17:00.470 --> 17:03.264
You can have anything I own.
My car. Sell my car.

17:03.306 --> 17:06.099
Sweetie, no one wants your car.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.103
There's something I haven't thought of.

17:09.186 --> 17:12.815
There's something out there staring me
right in the face. I haven't seen it.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.651
- You might consider calling...
- No.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.319
- But I don't think you have...
- Stop.

17:17.403 --> 17:18.820
You can at least go and...

17:18.905 --> 17:22.074
Okay, can I say one more thing?
I think it's your only option.

17:22.157 --> 17:25.994
There are several chapters
from a Stephen King novel I'd reenact...

17:26.078 --> 17:28.039
before I'd resort to that option.

17:28.122 --> 17:30.666
- Okay, dropped.
- Thank you.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.419
Mom, so what do you think?

17:33.502 --> 17:35.296
It makes you look smart.

17:35.379 --> 17:38.424
Okay, no more wine for you. Mom?

17:39.967 --> 17:42.470
You look like you were swallowed
by a kilt.

17:42.553 --> 17:44.096
Fine, you could hem it.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.140
A little, only a little.

17:46.223 --> 17:48.058
Okay. Or I could hem it a lot.

17:48.142 --> 17:50.311
No, I don't want it to be too short.

17:50.394 --> 17:53.147
I can't believe tomorrow's my last day
at Stars Hollow High.

17:53.230 --> 17:54.273
I know.

17:54.315 --> 17:57.109
- Today I was so excited, I dressed for gym.
- You're kidding!

17:57.151 --> 18:00.112
- And I played volleyball.
- With other people?

18:00.154 --> 18:03.032
And I learned all this time
I was avoiding group sports...

18:03.115 --> 18:04.867
was very smart, because I suck at them.

18:04.950 --> 18:06.493
You got that from me.

18:06.577 --> 18:08.704
- Where's your pate?
- At Zsa Zsa Gabor's house.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.373
I'm going to the store,
because you have nothing.

18:11.457 --> 18:14.543
- Do you feel like duck?
- Lf it's made with chicken, absolutely.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.587
- I'll be back.
- Bye.

18:17.546 --> 18:20.174
All right, this will give you an idea.

18:21.258 --> 18:23.469
- Go see how you like it.
- Okay.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.598
I love being a private school girl.

19:09.890 --> 19:11.141
Hi, Mom.

19:11.766 --> 19:14.728
Lorelai! My goodness, this is a surprise.

19:15.353 --> 19:16.897
Is it Easter already?

19:17.647 --> 19:21.484
No, I just finished up my business class,
and I thought I would stop by.

19:21.568 --> 19:23.278
- To see me?
- Yes.

19:25.113 --> 19:26.614
Isn't that nice.

19:26.698 --> 19:28.325
- Come in.
- Thanks.

19:33.455 --> 19:36.958
- The place looks great.
- It hasn't changed.

19:37.375 --> 19:38.835
There you go.

19:41.254 --> 19:43.465
How are the girls at the bridge club?

19:43.673 --> 19:44.799
Old.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.136
Good.

19:54.017 --> 19:56.477
You said you were taking
a business class?

19:57.145 --> 20:00.315
Yeah. I'm taking a business class
at the college twice a week.

20:00.356 --> 20:01.649
I'm sure I told you.

20:01.691 --> 20:04.193
If you're sure, then you must have.

20:07.655 --> 20:10.616
- Would you like some tea?
- I would love some coffee.

20:10.658 --> 20:13.661
- Emily, I'm home.
- We're in here.

20:14.328 --> 20:15.580
Hi, Dad.

20:17.290 --> 20:19.250
What is it, Christmas already?

20:19.375 --> 20:22.461
Lorelai was taking a business class
at the college today...

20:22.503 --> 20:24.505
and decided to drop in to see us.

20:24.547 --> 20:25.882
What business class?

20:25.965 --> 20:29.093
- She told us about it, dear. Remember?
- No.

20:32.096 --> 20:34.890
Actually, I came here for a reason.

20:34.974 --> 20:37.226
Dad, would you mind sitting down
for a minute?

20:37.310 --> 20:39.854
- You need money.
- I have a situation.

20:39.937 --> 20:43.816
- You need money.
- Dad, just please let me get this out, okay?

20:45.234 --> 20:47.987
Rory has been accepted to Chilton.

20:48.529 --> 20:52.116
Chilton? That's a wonderful school.

20:52.199 --> 20:53.993
It's only five minutes from here.

20:54.076 --> 20:57.496
That's right, it is.
She can start as early as Monday.

20:57.997 --> 21:01.709
The problem is that they want me
to put down an enrolment fee...

21:01.792 --> 21:03.669
plus the first semester's tuition.

21:03.711 --> 21:06.797
I have to do that immediately
or she loses her spot.

21:07.006 --> 21:09.091
So you need money.

21:10.342 --> 21:11.468
Yeah.

21:12.928 --> 21:15.639
But it's not for me, it's for Rory.

21:15.723 --> 21:19.476
I intend to pay you back, every cent.
I don't ask for favors. You know that.

21:19.518 --> 21:21.395
Yes, we know.

21:21.895 --> 21:23.564
I'll get the checkbook.

21:24.606 --> 21:28.026
Thank you. You have no idea. Thank you.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.863
- On one condition.
- So close.

21:31.155 --> 21:34.116
Since we are now financially involved
in your life...

21:34.658 --> 21:37.244
I want to be actively involved in your life.

21:38.912 --> 21:41.039
What does that mean, Mother?

21:41.164 --> 21:43.792
- I want a weekly dinner.
- What?

21:44.626 --> 21:47.379
Friday nights, you and Rory
will have dinner here.

21:47.462 --> 21:48.463
Mom.

21:48.547 --> 21:50.966
And you have to call us once a week...

21:51.008 --> 21:53.927
to give us an update
on her schooling and your life.

21:54.970 --> 21:57.139
That's it. That's the condition.

21:57.180 --> 21:59.808
If you agree,
you'll come to dinner tomorrow night...

21:59.891 --> 22:01.143
and leave here with the check.

22:01.226 --> 22:04.229
Otherwise, I'm sorry, we can't help you.

22:07.899 --> 22:11.027
I don't want her to know
that I borrowed money from you.

22:11.486 --> 22:13.613
Can that just be between us?

22:13.697 --> 22:15.615
Does 7:00 work for you?

22:17.284 --> 22:18.493
Perfect.

22:35.176 --> 22:37.095
And we get to wear uniforms.

22:37.137 --> 22:39.973
No more people checking you out
to see what you're wearing...

22:40.014 --> 22:43.518
'cause everyone's dressed alike
in boring clothes, just there to learn.

22:43.601 --> 22:46.604
Okay, there's academic-minded,
and then there's Amish.

22:46.688 --> 22:48.481
- Funny.
- Thank you.

22:49.232 --> 22:51.943
- I told my mom you're changing schools.
- Was she thrilled?

22:52.026 --> 22:54.529
The party's on Friday. I got to go.

22:54.821 --> 22:58.449
I have to have a pre-hayride cup of tea
with a future doctor.

22:58.533 --> 23:00.785
- How do I look, Korean?
- Spitting image.

23:00.868 --> 23:02.870
- Good. Bye.
- Bye.

23:11.671 --> 23:12.630
God!

23:13.631 --> 23:16.968
You're like Ruth Gordon,
just standing there with the tannis root.

23:17.009 --> 23:19.971
- Make a noise.
- Rosemary's Baby.

23:25.476 --> 23:28.062
- Yeah.
- That's a great movie.

23:28.980 --> 23:30.857
You've got good taste.

23:32.692 --> 23:34.277
Are you moving?

23:34.694 --> 23:36.529
No, just my books are.

23:36.612 --> 23:38.990
My family just moved here from Chicago.

23:39.073 --> 23:43.411
Chicago. Windy. Oprah.

23:43.494 --> 23:45.454
Yeah, that's the place.

23:46.664 --> 23:47.999
I'm Dean.

23:48.290 --> 23:49.542
Hi.

23:51.627 --> 23:54.130
Rory. Me. That's me.

23:55.965 --> 23:59.051
- Lorelai, technically.
- Lorelai. I like that.

23:59.427 --> 24:01.929
It's my mother's name, too.
She named me after herself.

24:02.012 --> 24:05.641
She was in the hospital thinking about
how men name boys after themselves...

24:05.683 --> 24:08.394
so why couldn't women?
She says her feminism took over.

24:08.477 --> 24:12.898
Personally, I think a lot of Demerol
also went into that decision.

24:13.274 --> 24:15.192
I never talk this much.

24:16.277 --> 24:17.778
I better go.

24:18.362 --> 24:20.698
- Sure.
- I have to go look for a job.

24:20.823 --> 24:22.199
Okay, good.

24:25.995 --> 24:28.747
- You should check with Miss Patty.
- What?

24:28.831 --> 24:31.333
About the job.
You should check with Miss Patty.

24:31.417 --> 24:34.211
She teaches dance.
She was actually on Broadway once.

24:34.795 --> 24:37.214
I don't really dance much.

24:37.339 --> 24:40.801
No, she just knows everything
that's going on in town.

24:41.051 --> 24:43.136
She'll know if someone's looking.

24:44.721 --> 24:46.682
Great. Thanks.

24:50.769 --> 24:54.314
- What are you doing now?
- Nothing much.

24:55.983 --> 24:58.318
I should throw this away at some point.

24:58.402 --> 25:01.488
Maybe you could show me
where this Miss Patty's place is.

25:01.655 --> 25:05.200
Yeah, I guess so.
I really don't have anything important to...

25:05.701 --> 25:07.035
Let's go.

25:15.168 --> 25:18.296
- Have you lived here all your life?
- Yes. Pretty much.

25:18.380 --> 25:21.132
- I was actually born in Hartford.
- That's not far.

25:21.299 --> 25:23.343
- Thirty minutes with no traffic.
- Really?

25:23.426 --> 25:25.470
- I timed it.
- Okay, then.

25:31.017 --> 25:33.353
- Do you like cake?
- What?

25:34.771 --> 25:37.273
They make really good cakes here.

25:37.357 --> 25:39.651
They're very round.

25:40.777 --> 25:42.570
Okay, I'll remember that.

25:42.654 --> 25:44.823
Good. Make a note.

25:45.156 --> 25:48.576
You wouldn't want to forget
where the round cakes are.

25:49.452 --> 25:51.329
How are you liking Moby Dick?

25:51.371 --> 25:53.164
- It's really good.
- Yeah?

25:53.206 --> 25:55.667
- Yeah, it's my first Melville.
- Cool.

25:55.708 --> 25:59.712
I know it's cliche to pick Moby Dick
as your first Melville, but...

26:00.838 --> 26:03.591
How did you know
I was reading Moby Dick?

26:05.510 --> 26:07.887
- I've been watching you.
- Watching me?

26:07.971 --> 26:12.350
Not in a creepy I'm-watching-you
sort of way. I've noticed you.

26:13.017 --> 26:14.352
- Me?
- Yeah.

26:14.936 --> 26:16.062
When?

26:16.938 --> 26:18.231
Every day.

26:19.524 --> 26:23.027
After school, you come out
and sit under that tree, and you read.

26:23.111 --> 26:26.614
Last week it was Madame Bovary.
This week it's Moby Dick.

26:27.365 --> 26:30.409
- But why would you...
- Because you're nice to look at...

26:30.535 --> 26:33.120
and because you've got
unbelievable concentration.

26:33.412 --> 26:34.455
What?

26:34.497 --> 26:36.707
Last Friday, two guys were tossing a ball...

26:36.791 --> 26:38.918
and one guy nailed the other
right in the face.

26:39.001 --> 26:41.504
It was a mess. Blood everywhere,
the nurse came out...

26:41.587 --> 26:45.007
the place was in chaos,
his girlfriend was freaking out...

26:45.049 --> 26:48.219
and you just sat there and read.
You never even looked up.

26:48.803 --> 26:53.182
I thought, 'I've never seen anyone read
so intensely before in my entire life.

26:53.349 --> 26:55.476
'I have to meet that girl. '

26:56.185 --> 27:00.356
Maybe I just didn't look up
because I'm unbelievably self-centered.

27:00.689 --> 27:03.150
Maybe, but I doubt it.

27:06.821 --> 27:09.865
- Did I ask you if you like cake?
- Yeah, you did.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.411
'Cause they have
really good cake back there.

27:26.048 --> 27:28.634
You were late getting home tonight.

27:29.009 --> 27:31.220
Yeah, I went to the library.

27:33.430 --> 27:36.934
We're having dinner
with the grandparents tomorrow night.

27:37.017 --> 27:39.269
We are? But it's September.

27:39.686 --> 27:42.272
- So?
- So what holiday is in September?

27:42.356 --> 27:44.983
Look, it's not a holiday thing.
It's just dinner, okay?

27:45.067 --> 27:46.527
Fine. Sorry.

27:51.698 --> 27:53.992
Red meat can kill you. Enjoy.

27:59.206 --> 28:01.792
I finished hemming your skirt today.

28:04.920 --> 28:07.506
A grunt of acknowledgement
might be nice.

28:07.589 --> 28:09.841
Why are we going to dinner
tomorrow night?

28:09.925 --> 28:12.094
What if I had plans?
You didn't even ask me.

28:12.177 --> 28:14.262
- Lf you had plans, I'd have known.
- How?

28:14.346 --> 28:15.722
You would've told me.

28:15.806 --> 28:18.016
I don't tell you everything.
I have my own things.

28:18.100 --> 28:21.228
- Fine, you have things.
- That's right. I have things.

28:21.311 --> 28:24.648
- I had dibs on being the bitch tonight.
- Just tonight?

28:25.023 --> 28:27.359
What the hell is wrong with you?

28:29.486 --> 28:32.113
I'm not sure I want to go to Chilton.

28:32.530 --> 28:35.158
- What?
- The timing is just really bad.

28:35.659 --> 28:37.285
The timing is bad?

28:37.369 --> 28:40.956
And the bus ride to and from Hartford,
it's 30 minutes each way.

28:41.039 --> 28:43.041
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

28:43.083 --> 28:45.752
I don't think we should be spending
that money right now.

28:45.835 --> 28:48.046
I know Chilton's
got to be costing you a lot.

28:48.380 --> 28:49.964
You've no idea.

28:50.048 --> 28:52.801
Your money should be going
into buying an inn with Sookie.

28:52.884 --> 28:54.844
What about college? What about Harvard?

28:54.928 --> 28:58.181
We don't know I can't get into Harvard
if I stay where I am.

28:58.723 --> 29:00.600
Enough of the crazy talk, okay?

29:00.683 --> 29:03.978
I appreciate your concern,
but I have this covered.

29:04.604 --> 29:06.272
- I still don't want to go.
- Why?

29:06.356 --> 29:09.317
- Because I don't.
- I have to get out of here.

29:13.404 --> 29:15.198
We have to pay first.

29:42.475 --> 29:47.355
One, two, three. It's a waltz, ladies.
Susie, do you have to tinkle?

29:47.480 --> 29:49.190
Then uncross your legs, darling.

29:49.273 --> 29:52.777
Rory, I think I found a job
for your male friend.

29:53.361 --> 29:54.612
What male friend?

29:54.695 --> 29:56.530
They need a stock boy at the supermarket.

29:56.572 --> 29:58.658
I already talked
to Taylor Doose about him.

29:58.699 --> 30:00.326
Just send him around tomorrow.

30:00.368 --> 30:03.120
- Okay, thanks.
- What male friend?

30:03.537 --> 30:06.665
He's very cute. You have good taste.

30:07.291 --> 30:09.502
Hands in the air, not in the nose.

30:11.837 --> 30:13.964
You'll have to walk faster than that.

30:14.048 --> 30:17.259
You'll have to turn into frigging Flo Jo
to get away from me.

30:21.388 --> 30:23.933
This is about a boy. Of course!

30:24.266 --> 30:27.978
I can't believe I didn't see it.
All this talk about money and bus rides.

30:28.062 --> 30:30.606
You've got a guy,
and you don't wanna leave school.

30:30.689 --> 30:32.608
- I'm going to bed.
- God, I'm so dense.

30:32.691 --> 30:35.861
It should've been my first thought.
After all, you're me.

30:37.071 --> 30:38.238
- I'm not you.
- Really?

30:38.322 --> 30:41.700
Someone ready to throw important
life experiences out to be with a guy?

30:41.784 --> 30:44.286
- It sounds like me to me.
- Whatever.

30:44.453 --> 30:46.246
- Who is he?
- There's no guy.

30:46.330 --> 30:48.999
Dark hair, romantic eyes,
looks a little dangerous?

30:49.082 --> 30:51.668
- This conversation's over.
- Tattoos are good, too.

30:51.710 --> 30:54.338
I don't wanna change schools
because of all the reasons...

30:54.421 --> 30:56.131
I've already told you a thousand times.

30:56.215 --> 30:59.092
If you don't want to believe me,
that's fine. Goodnight.

30:59.176 --> 31:00.719
Does he have a motorcycle?

31:00.802 --> 31:04.640
If you're going to throw your life away,
he'd better have a motorcycle!

31:09.144 --> 31:12.230
- I think that went pretty well, don't you?
- Thanks for the knock.

31:12.314 --> 31:14.691
Listen, can we just start all over, okay?

31:14.775 --> 31:19.196
You tell me all about the guy,
and I promise not to let my head explode.

31:20.697 --> 31:22.657
Rory, please talk to me.

31:24.326 --> 31:26.036
Okay, I'll talk.

31:26.119 --> 31:28.163
Don't get me wrong, guys are great.

31:28.246 --> 31:30.207
I am a huge fan of guys.

31:30.540 --> 31:34.127
You don't get knocked up at 16
being indifferent to guys.

31:34.377 --> 31:37.547
Babe, guys are always gonna be there.
This school isn't.

31:37.631 --> 31:40.800
It's more important.
It has to be more important.

31:41.259 --> 31:42.969
I'm going to sleep.

31:45.972 --> 31:49.017
You've always been the sensible one
in this house.

31:49.059 --> 31:51.603
I need you to remember that feeling now.

31:51.686 --> 31:54.564
You will kick your own butt later
if you blow this.

31:54.647 --> 31:57.067
- It's my butt.
- Good comeback.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.028
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Rory, come on.

32:00.111 --> 32:04.073
I don't want to talk about this.
Could you please just leave me alone?

32:05.241 --> 32:07.869
Okay. Fine.

32:10.914 --> 32:13.124
We've always had a democracy
in this house.

32:13.208 --> 32:15.793
We never did anything
unless we both agreed.

32:15.877 --> 32:19.339
But now I guess I'm gonna have to play
the mom card.

32:20.131 --> 32:22.800
You are going to Chilton
whether you want to or not.

32:22.967 --> 32:26.054
Monday morning, you will be there.
End of story.

32:27.096 --> 32:29.182
- We'll see.
- Yeah, we will.

32:56.250 --> 32:58.210
Okay. One, two...

32:59.962 --> 33:03.341
- I swear I don't know what happened.
- It's not important.

33:03.424 --> 33:06.385
I've made that dish a hundred times.
It never exploded.

33:06.677 --> 33:10.014
- Please forget it.
- God, I killed a Viking.

33:10.097 --> 33:13.601
You should fire me
or make me pay the cost of a new stove...

33:13.684 --> 33:15.561
- out of my paycheck.
- Whatever you want.

33:15.644 --> 33:18.189
I can't afford a new stove.
Those things are expensive.

33:18.272 --> 33:21.817
Sookie, please, I am begging you,
pull yourself together.

33:21.859 --> 33:25.196
I got no sleep last night, and I think
I put my contacts in backwards.

33:25.362 --> 33:29.116
- Rory's still mad at you?
- I'm not so crazy about her, either.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.744
It was a fight.
Mothers and daughters fight.

33:31.827 --> 33:34.413
No, we don't fight. We never fight.

33:34.496 --> 33:36.832
You told me to tell you
when your daughter arrived.

33:36.874 --> 33:40.753
- She's here, and she's sitting in my chair.
- Hold on just a minute.

33:44.381 --> 33:46.550
And you are the one left standing.

33:46.633 --> 33:49.094
Life is a funny thing, no?

33:51.930 --> 33:55.058
No muumuu today.
You know what's weird? I kind of miss it.

33:55.142 --> 33:56.768
You left me a note to meet you here.

33:56.852 --> 34:00.689
I thought you might want to work
a couple hours, make a little extra cash.

34:00.731 --> 34:02.691
- Fine.
- You're not gonna give me...

34:02.774 --> 34:05.027
the Mommie Dearest treatment forever,
are you?

34:05.068 --> 34:08.614
You wanted me here, I'm here.
Should I do something or what?

34:08.697 --> 34:12.159
Yeah, go home. Dinner's at 7:00.
Be ready to go.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.077
- Fine.
- Fine.

34:19.081 --> 34:20.417
My chair.

34:32.929 --> 34:37.184
Do we go in or do we just stand here
reenacting The Little Match Girl?

34:39.853 --> 34:43.940
Look, I know we're having a thing here,
and I know you hate me...

34:44.024 --> 34:45.942
but be civil, at least through dinner...

34:46.025 --> 34:49.112
and then on the way home
you can pull a Menendez. Deal?

34:49.404 --> 34:50.487
Fine.

34:57.954 --> 35:00.373
- Hi, Grandma.
- You're right on time.

35:00.498 --> 35:02.417
Yeah, no traffic at all.

35:04.711 --> 35:07.797
I can't tell you what a treat it is
to have you girls here.

35:08.965 --> 35:10.717
We're excited, too.

35:11.301 --> 35:14.804
Is that a collector's cup,
or can I throw it away for you?

35:14.888 --> 35:17.599
- In the kitchen, please.
- Sorry.

35:19.392 --> 35:23.521
- I want to hear all about Chilton.
- I haven't actually started yet.

35:27.859 --> 35:31.195
- Richard, look who's here.
- Rory.

35:32.822 --> 35:35.199
- You're tall.
- I guess.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.660
- What's your height?
- 5'7'.

35:37.827 --> 35:41.122
- That's tall. She's tall.
- Hi, Dad.

35:41.330 --> 35:45.209
- Lorelai, your daughter's tall.
- I know. It's freakish.

35:45.293 --> 35:47.712
We're thinking of having her
studied at MIT.

35:48.546 --> 35:51.507
- Champagne, anyone?
- That's fancy.

35:52.133 --> 35:54.844
It's not every day
I have my girls here for dinner...

35:54.886 --> 35:56.804
on a day the banks are open.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.765
A toast: To Rory entering Chilton...

35:59.849 --> 36:01.851
and an exciting new phase in her life.

36:02.268 --> 36:03.728
Hear, hear.

36:04.895 --> 36:06.856
Let's sit, everyone.

36:10.526 --> 36:12.403
This is just wonderful.

36:12.570 --> 36:16.782
An education is the most important thing
in the world, next to family.

36:16.866 --> 36:18.117
And pie.

36:21.412 --> 36:22.496
Joke.

36:41.515 --> 36:44.101
- Rory, how do you like the lamb?
- It's good.

36:44.184 --> 36:46.312
- Too dry?
- No, it's perfect.

36:47.396 --> 36:49.857
The potatoes could use
a little salt, though.

36:49.982 --> 36:51.358
Excuse me?

36:52.026 --> 36:54.611
So, Grandpa, how's the insurance biz?

36:54.945 --> 36:59.116
People die, we pay.
People crash cars, we pay.

36:59.199 --> 37:03.370
- People lose a foot, we pay.
- At least you have your new slogan.

37:03.787 --> 37:07.332
- How are things at the motel?
- The inn? They're great.

37:07.666 --> 37:10.627
Lorelai's the executive manager now.
Isn't that wonderful?

37:10.794 --> 37:13.380
Speaking of which,
Christopher called yesterday.

37:13.463 --> 37:16.508
Speaking of which?
How is that a speaking of which?

37:16.550 --> 37:18.385
He's doing very well in California.

37:18.468 --> 37:20.637
His internet start-up
goes public next month.

37:20.721 --> 37:23.974
This could mean big things for him.
Very talented man, your father.

37:24.057 --> 37:27.102
- She knows.
- He always was a smart one, that boy.

37:27.894 --> 37:29.521
You must take after him.

37:29.563 --> 37:33.817
Speaking of which,
I'm going to get a Coke. Or a knife.

37:52.586 --> 37:54.504
Hi, how are you doing?

37:59.968 --> 38:02.679
- I think I'm going to go talk to her.
- No. I'll go.

38:02.887 --> 38:05.724
You stay
and keep your grandfather company.

38:09.769 --> 38:11.855
Lorelai, come back to the table.

38:11.896 --> 38:14.065
Is it going to be like this
every Friday night?

38:14.149 --> 38:16.151
I come over
and let the two of you attack me?

38:16.234 --> 38:18.069
- You're being very dramatic.
- Dramatic?

38:18.153 --> 38:20.446
- Were you at that table just now?
- Yes, I was.

38:20.530 --> 38:22.866
You took what your father said
the wrong way.

38:22.907 --> 38:25.451
The wrong way?
How could I have taken it the wrong way?

38:25.535 --> 38:28.079
- What was open to interpretation?
- Keep your voice down.

38:28.162 --> 38:31.624
No, Mother. I can't take it anymore.
Tonight has been like a nightmare.

38:31.749 --> 38:34.335
You're dripping all over the floor.

38:34.419 --> 38:36.462
Why do you pounce
on every single thing I say?

38:36.546 --> 38:39.632
That's absurd.
You've barely uttered a word all night.

38:39.716 --> 38:41.634
- That's not true.
- You said 'pie. '

38:41.718 --> 38:43.970
- Come on.
- You did. All I heard you say was 'pie. '

38:44.053 --> 38:46.556
Why bring up Christopher?
Was that really necessary?

38:46.639 --> 38:49.016
- He likes Christopher.
- Isn't that interesting?

38:49.058 --> 38:51.811
Because, as I remember,
when Christopher got me pregnant...

38:51.894 --> 38:53.437
Dad didn't like him so much.

38:53.521 --> 38:57.692
You were 16. What were we supposed
to do, throw you a party?

38:57.733 --> 39:01.195
We were disappointed.
The two of you had such bright futures.

39:01.237 --> 39:05.491
Yes. And by not getting married,
we got to keep those bright futures.

39:05.700 --> 39:10.121
When you get pregnant, you get married.
A child needs a mother and a father.

39:10.663 --> 39:13.624
Do you think Christopher
would have his own company now...

39:13.708 --> 39:16.168
if we were married?
You think he'd be anything at all?

39:16.252 --> 39:18.087
Yes, I do. Your father would've put him...

39:18.170 --> 39:21.590
in the insurance business,
and you'd be living a lovely life right now.

39:21.632 --> 39:23.884
He didn't want
to be in the insurance business.

39:23.968 --> 39:26.679
And I am living a lovely life right now.

39:26.762 --> 39:29.515
- That's right. Far away from us.
- Here we go.

39:29.598 --> 39:32.810
You took that girl
and completely shut us out of your life.

39:32.893 --> 39:35.646
- You wanted to control me.
- You were still a child.

39:35.729 --> 39:38.732
I stopped being a child
the minute the strip turned pink, okay?

39:38.816 --> 39:41.986
I had to figure out how to live.
I found a good job.

39:42.069 --> 39:44.989
As a maid. With all your brains and talent.

39:45.072 --> 39:47.574
I worked my way up. I run the place now.

39:47.658 --> 39:50.703
I built a life on my own
with no help from anyone.

39:50.786 --> 39:54.373
Yes, and think of where you would've been
if you'd accepted a little help.

39:54.415 --> 39:56.375
And where Rory would have been?

39:56.417 --> 40:00.129
But no, you were always too proud
to accept anything from anyone.

40:00.212 --> 40:03.465
I wasn't too proud to come here
to you two...

40:03.549 --> 40:05.968
begging for money
for my kid's school, was I?

40:06.051 --> 40:07.261
No, you certainly weren't.

40:07.344 --> 40:10.889
But you're too proud to let her know
where you got it from, aren't you?

40:10.931 --> 40:15.644
Fine, you have your precious pride,
and I have my weekly dinners.

40:16.270 --> 40:18.480
Isn't that nice? We both win.

40:38.417 --> 40:39.501
Mom?

40:40.544 --> 40:42.379
I'm okay. I just...

40:42.754 --> 40:45.590
Do I look shorter? Because I feel shorter.

40:47.050 --> 40:49.594
How about I buy you a cup of coffee?

40:53.598 --> 40:58.186
You drive, though, 'cause I don't think
my feet will reach the pedals.

40:59.896 --> 41:04.109
- Nice dinner at the grandparents' house.
- Yeah. Her dishes have never been cleaner.

41:04.234 --> 41:06.903
You and Grandma
seemed to have a nice talk.

41:06.945 --> 41:09.072
- How much did you hear?
- Not much.

41:09.155 --> 41:10.198
Snippets.

41:10.281 --> 41:12.242
- Little snippets.
- So basically everything?

41:12.283 --> 41:14.994
- Basically, yes.
- The best-laid plans.

41:20.542 --> 41:23.837
I think it was really brave of you
to ask them for money.

41:24.045 --> 41:26.464
I so do not want to talk about it.

41:27.423 --> 41:30.134
How many meals is it gonna take
till we're off the hook?

41:30.218 --> 41:33.888
I think the deli spread
at my funeral will be the last one.

41:38.017 --> 41:39.978
Wait, does that mean...

41:41.020 --> 41:43.606
Can't let a perfectly good plaid skirt
go to waste.

41:44.273 --> 41:46.275
Honey, you won't be sorry.

41:51.447 --> 41:54.700
You look nice. Really nice.

41:56.661 --> 42:00.164
I had a meeting earlier at the bank.
They like collars.

42:00.873 --> 42:02.625
You look nice, too.

42:03.209 --> 42:05.503
I had a flagellation to go to.

42:06.629 --> 42:09.507
- What'll you have?
- Coffee, in a vat.

42:11.259 --> 42:14.011
I'll have coffee also. And chili fries.

42:14.762 --> 42:17.640
That's quite a refined palate you got there.

42:21.435 --> 42:24.021
Behold the healing powers of a bath.

42:26.899 --> 42:28.734
Tell me about the guy.

42:29.235 --> 42:32.029
You know what's really special
about our relationship?

42:32.113 --> 42:34.740
The total understanding about the need
for one's privacy.

42:34.824 --> 42:37.243
You really understand boundaries.

42:37.618 --> 42:39.620
- So tell me about the guy.
- Mom!

42:39.662 --> 42:42.581
- Is he dreamy?
- That's so Nick at Nite.

42:42.665 --> 42:45.125
- I'm gonna find out anyway.
- Really? How?

42:45.876 --> 42:47.127
I'll spy.

42:47.836 --> 42:49.380
Coffee.

42:50.422 --> 42:51.715
Fries.

42:53.008 --> 42:57.054
I can't stand it. This is so unhealthy.
Rory, please, put down that cup of coffee.

42:57.137 --> 42:59.682
You do not want to grow up
to be like your mom.

42:59.765 --> 43:01.350
Sorry. Too late.

43:08.899 --> 43:11.777
- Tell me about the guy.
- Check, please.

43:11.819 --> 43:14.780
- Are you embarrassed to bring him home?
- I'm not embarrassed.

43:14.863 --> 43:17.783
- Does he talk at all?
- No, Mom, he's a mime.
