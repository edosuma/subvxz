00:51.069 --> 00:55.031
[Richard] Regard my latest
and perhaps greatest creations...

00:55.114 --> 00:57.241
the bionoclone!

00:57.325 --> 00:59.703
The natural instinct of all savage beasts,

00:59.786 --> 01:03.665
even highly enhanced clones,
is to mistrust humankind.

01:03.748 --> 01:08.044
Hmm, in your case,
their instincts are dead on.

01:08.962 --> 01:13.132
True, but my science will overcome
even those instincts.

01:13.216 --> 01:15.760
Because I hold the controls.

01:15.844 --> 01:19.513
These bionoclones
I created from Lady's DNA

01:19.597 --> 01:23.559
will make the perfect designer guard pets
for my black market buyers.

- [gasping]

01:25.561 --> 01:27.521
[electricity crackling]

01:29.023 --> 01:30.817
So much for free will.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.029
Who needs nature when I command science?

01:36.530 --> 01:37.949
[Lukas sighing] So far so good.

01:38.032 --> 01:41.702
- I don't see a thing.
- Hmm. Neither do I.

01:41.786 --> 01:43.830
What am I looking for?

01:43.913 --> 01:46.499
- [chuckling] You'll see.
- [footsteps thudding]

01:46.582 --> 01:48.167
Or you won't.

- [Lucky yelping]

01:53.882 --> 01:55.133
Lucky!

02:02.223 --> 02:05.434
Jonesy made a mobile camo-generator
inside Kong's jet pack!

02:05.518 --> 02:07.603
- Sweet, huh?
- [laugh] Cool! Totally!

02:07.686 --> 02:08.812
I want one!

02:08.896 --> 02:12.233
Sorry, Panchi, but our jet packs
aren't big enough to add a camo-generator.

02:12.316 --> 02:13.401
[grunting]

02:13.484 --> 02:15.236
Even with a Kong-size unit,

02:15.319 --> 02:18.239
so far I can only get it to last
two to three minutes at a time.

02:18.322 --> 02:20.033
[grunting]

02:22.786 --> 02:24.703
[Danny] Not quite four yet.

02:24.788 --> 02:25.872
[straining]

02:25.955 --> 02:28.833
Good news is,
the unit can regenerate on the fly.

02:28.917 --> 02:31.044
- But it still poops out too soon.
- [Danny chuckling]

02:31.127 --> 02:32.461
Jonesy said "poop."

02:32.545 --> 02:33.880
[laughing]

02:35.882 --> 02:37.842
[scoffing] What are you, ten?

02:37.926 --> 02:39.302
Uh, yeah.

02:39.385 --> 02:42.263
Ten years, two months,
and nine days, actually.

02:42.346 --> 02:46.225
Hopefully you can amp it up to last
at least a few more minutes each time.

02:46.309 --> 02:49.520
That thing poops out in the middle
of a mission and it's game over.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.690
Ha! Lukas said it, too!

02:52.773 --> 02:54.608
- Poops!
- [laughing]

02:56.444 --> 02:57.987
[sighs] Boys.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.490
[Richard] As you can see, Botila,

03:01.574 --> 03:05.995
the same technology I use to keep you
and all my bionobots under my control...

03:06.079 --> 03:09.207
is installed in each of my bionoclones,

03:09.290 --> 03:12.961
which, of course, are worth more than
normal clones or even bots.

03:13.044 --> 03:16.089
Because I can boost
their aggression response,

03:16.172 --> 03:20.384
turning them from exotic pets
into living weapons!

03:20.468 --> 03:24.889
Each bionoclone has a control device
keyed to their internal tech.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.392
[laughing]

03:28.476 --> 03:32.105
The controls can only be keyed
with the bionoclones present,

03:32.188 --> 03:34.232
so my clients will be forced to return

03:34.315 --> 03:37.110
for any expensive repairs or upgrades.

03:39.153 --> 03:41.322
As long as Kong's invisible...

03:41.405 --> 03:43.782
we might as well see
what Richard's up to.

03:45.076 --> 03:46.119
What?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.913
That looks like Lady!
But how?

03:48.997 --> 03:51.124
We know she didn't survive that night...

03:51.207 --> 03:52.291
[Kong grunting]

03:52.375 --> 03:54.043
No, Kong! It's not Lady.

03:54.127 --> 03:55.378
Don't go down there! Kong!

03:55.461 --> 03:58.214
- Did he go?
- [sighs] No idea!

03:59.257 --> 04:00.925
But I do see something interesting.

04:01.968 --> 04:03.177
Three ligers!

04:03.261 --> 04:05.304
You see, Kong!
It's not Lady.

04:06.222 --> 04:08.057
Kong, are you still here?

04:09.100 --> 04:10.351
[Kong grunting]

04:11.144 --> 04:13.479
[sighs] Good boy, Kong.

04:13.562 --> 04:15.523
Lukas, I think it's safe to say,

04:15.606 --> 04:19.067
your brother's up to something big,
nasty, and unnatural.

04:19.152 --> 04:20.236
As usual.

04:20.319 --> 04:22.405
Yeah, they look so much like Lady...

04:22.488 --> 04:24.657
I'm guessing they're some kind of clones.

04:24.740 --> 04:26.784
But cloning's been highly regulated

04:26.868 --> 04:28.995
ever since
the Giant Tentacle Disaster of 2027.

04:29.078 --> 04:30.663
[screaming]

04:31.747 --> 04:34.083
Not that that would stop Richard
for a hot second.

04:34.167 --> 04:36.127
[Lukas gasps] Hey, bro.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.670
Thanks for sticking close.

04:37.753 --> 04:41.132
[Jonesy] Time to beat it back to base
to recharge your camo-generator.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.258
[Kong grunts]

04:42.341 --> 04:43.592
Don't worry, big guy,

04:43.676 --> 04:46.679
I've been working on a little something
that should help do the trick.

04:57.690 --> 05:00.234
[Jonesy] Chatter Cam is up and running.

05:00.318 --> 05:02.278
That is totally brilliant, Jonesy.

05:02.361 --> 05:03.821
[chuckling] Yeah, I know.

05:04.613 --> 05:05.614
Super spy!

05:05.698 --> 05:09.285
<i>Bawk! On the fly! Bawk! Bawk!</i>

05:09.368 --> 05:12.246
Yo, double O, tone it down,
or you'll blow your cover.

05:14.790 --> 05:17.501
[Wheeler scoffs] <i>Big tough cats.</i>

05:17.585 --> 05:20.379
<i>One twist and you're helpless as kittens.</i>

05:21.464 --> 05:22.548
<i>Sit tight.</i>

05:22.631 --> 05:26.802
<i>You got a date with a rich guy
who likes very expensive toys!</i>

05:30.431 --> 05:32.183
Looks like they're headed
towards the bridge.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.392
That's where we'll stop them.

05:33.476 --> 05:35.311
[Danny] Clones aren't real animals.

05:35.394 --> 05:36.812
I wonder if I'll be able to talk to them.

05:36.895 --> 05:38.606
Clones are living creatures.

05:38.689 --> 05:41.900
They deserve the same kindness
and respect as all animals.

05:41.985 --> 05:43.194
Right, Lukas?

05:43.277 --> 05:44.862
Absolutely, Panchi!

05:44.945 --> 05:48.532
What Richard's doing
is abusing nature and science.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.827
Never forget, Danny, all life is precious.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.954
So let's go save those lovely Ladies!

05:54.038 --> 05:56.165
[grunting]

05:56.249 --> 05:57.416
[roars]

05:58.584 --> 05:59.918
[Wheeler snickers] Sit up!

06:00.003 --> 06:02.880
Now, roll over! [laughing]

06:05.424 --> 06:07.926
[gasping] What the...

06:08.011 --> 06:09.595
[alarm beeping]

06:18.229 --> 06:19.647
[tires squealing]

06:19.730 --> 06:21.482
This can't be happening!

06:22.941 --> 06:24.693
[indistinct chatter]

06:24.777 --> 06:26.362
[crowd gasping]

06:26.445 --> 06:27.738
[Kong] Uh-oh.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.865
Not even two minutes this time.

06:29.948 --> 06:31.825
[sighs] Looks like it's back
to the drawing board.

06:31.909 --> 06:34.162
- Oh, poop!
- Double poop.

06:34.245 --> 06:35.371
[grunting]

06:36.247 --> 06:38.832
The ape has camo-tech!

06:38.916 --> 06:40.251
And a jet pack!

06:40.334 --> 06:42.878
I'm the one who's supposed
to have the best toys!

06:42.961 --> 06:46.382
You're jealous of a feebleminded primate?

06:46.465 --> 06:49.552
Oh, just go to the bridge
and get my bionoclones back!

06:49.635 --> 06:50.678
Now!

06:50.761 --> 06:52.555
[crowd screaming]

06:54.390 --> 06:56.892
The monster ape's after our clones!

06:56.975 --> 06:59.645
We need to corral
those wildcats with these...

06:59.728 --> 07:01.522
- [roaring]
- [screaming]

07:03.774 --> 07:05.276
[collar beeping]

07:06.360 --> 07:08.987
- I hate that overgrown gorilla.
- [hooting]

07:09.072 --> 07:10.406
Our cover's blown!

07:10.489 --> 07:13.242
Danny, take over the controls
and activate autopilot!

07:13.326 --> 07:14.952
You got it, Lukas!

07:16.495 --> 07:19.248
Jonesy, let's use your laser-nets
to bag those ligers

07:19.332 --> 07:20.916
and get them out of here
before the police...

07:20.999 --> 07:24.420
[policeman over PA] Lukas Remy,
surrender with your ape or we open fire.

07:24.503 --> 07:28.924
- [sirens wailing]
- Oh, this does look bad for brother dear.

07:29.007 --> 07:32.553
But not quite bad enough for my taste.

07:33.804 --> 07:36.474
Oh, this could not get any worse!

07:36.557 --> 07:38.767
[pterodactyls screeching]

07:38.851 --> 07:41.479
[sighs] Okay, so I was wrong.

07:43.021 --> 07:44.940
[Botila] Get on! Now!

07:46.192 --> 07:47.526
[whirring]

07:51.280 --> 07:52.948
[crowd screaming]

07:57.120 --> 07:59.372
<i>Please, remain calm!</i>

07:59.455 --> 08:02.458
<i>My bionobotic dinosaurs will not harm you.</i>

08:02.541 --> 08:06.837
<i>I sent them to help protect you
from the savage ape and wild ligers</i>

08:06.920 --> 08:10.424
<i>Lukas Remy has viciously unleashed
on San Francisco!</i>

08:10.508 --> 08:12.135
Ah, great!

08:14.095 --> 08:17.140
I'll take down that wildcat
with this tranquilizer dart.

08:18.849 --> 08:21.977
[Richard] <i>I have assigned
my most trusted and competent agents</i>

08:22.060 --> 08:25.231
<i>to resolve this emergency
as quickly as possible.</i>

08:30.444 --> 08:32.029
Way to go, Kong!

08:33.155 --> 08:34.907
- [snarling]
- Whoa! [gasping]

08:35.948 --> 08:37.743
Take it easy!

08:37.826 --> 08:39.912
We're on your side.

08:39.995 --> 08:43.124
[whispering] Good time to find out
if you can talk to clones.

08:44.167 --> 08:46.294
Okay, just get in the cage

08:46.377 --> 08:48.546
and we'll take you someplace safe...

08:48.629 --> 08:50.088
I promise.

08:53.050 --> 08:54.302
[Panchi sighing]

08:54.385 --> 08:57.012
- You can add clone-whisperer to your...
- [Kong roaring]

08:59.265 --> 09:00.766
[grunting]

09:02.100 --> 09:03.477
[hooting]

09:07.440 --> 09:08.982
- [both exclaiming]
- [Kong screaming]

09:13.946 --> 09:16.240
Kong can't swim!
If he falls in the water,

09:16.324 --> 09:17.866
he's sunk!

09:17.950 --> 09:19.160
Did you hear that?

09:19.243 --> 09:21.162
[Richard] Loud and clear.

09:21.245 --> 09:24.748
That dumb ape doesn't know how to swim.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.209
[grunting]

09:30.338 --> 09:31.630
[roaring]

09:33.799 --> 09:37.595
Uh, which one of these buttons
activates the smoke screen?

09:37.678 --> 09:40.806
[straining] It beats me.
I just eenie-meenie-miney-moe it.

09:40.889 --> 09:44.768
Huh? I don't know the Spanish translation
for eenie-weenie-whatever.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.396
So I'll just try... this one!

09:49.315 --> 09:50.358
[Panchi] Whoops! Okay.

09:50.441 --> 09:52.443
- How about this one?
- [hissing]

09:53.652 --> 09:57.448
All right! Now, the police
and Botila can't see anything!

09:57.531 --> 09:59.032
And neither can we!

09:59.116 --> 10:00.993
Oops. Uh, but don't sweat it,

10:01.076 --> 10:03.246
I'll just set the autopilot for home.

10:03.329 --> 10:05.414
And we're outta here!

10:05.498 --> 10:07.082
Eat smoke, Botila!

10:07.165 --> 10:11.003
C'mon, Kong!
Let's make like a banana and split!

10:11.086 --> 10:13.381
[Panchi] I cannot believe you said that.

10:14.131 --> 10:16.550
[groans] Gonna be tough
to spot the cats now.

10:16.634 --> 10:20.388
I see one running into the Redwoods
with Botila on her heels.

10:20.471 --> 10:22.055
- But I don't see the other.
- I do!

10:22.139 --> 10:24.558
The poachers are chasing her towards SF.

10:24.642 --> 10:28.854
Right, I'll head for the city since
I'm sure you'll want to go after Botila.

10:28.937 --> 10:30.314
You got that right.

10:31.524 --> 10:33.150
[coughing]

10:36.487 --> 10:39.240
[sighing] I miss 2049,

10:39.323 --> 10:43.160
when criminals were just evil,
not supersized.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.499
Hold your fire, Botila,
or I won't hold mine!

10:48.582 --> 10:49.625
[pterodactyl screeching]

10:50.709 --> 10:52.670
You asked for it!

10:59.260 --> 11:00.594
[grunting]

11:06.392 --> 11:09.895
You are consistently annoying me,
Mr. Jones.

11:09.978 --> 11:11.522
Part of my charm!

11:11.605 --> 11:14.358
And after all we've been through,
call me Jonesy.

11:16.234 --> 11:17.945
[clanking and whirring]

11:21.114 --> 11:22.533
[gasps]

11:24.618 --> 11:25.703
Huh!

11:26.829 --> 11:29.332
On foot in the Redwoods,
I definitely have the advantage.

11:30.248 --> 11:32.626
Just keep telling yourself that,
Mr. Jones.

11:37.005 --> 11:38.674
Hey, I think I spotted the cat!

11:41.469 --> 11:43.387
Ugh, useless!

12:03.699 --> 12:05.618
[heart beating rapidly]

12:07.327 --> 12:10.998
Is that your heart beating for me, Jonesy?

12:11.081 --> 12:12.165
[gasps]

12:13.250 --> 12:15.628
Time for me to break it.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.132
- [grunting]
- [crackling]

12:21.717 --> 12:22.718
[grunting]

12:26.221 --> 12:27.431
[grunting]

12:40.903 --> 12:42.530
Back off, Botila.

12:43.697 --> 12:46.492
I'm a 7th-Dan black belt in bojutsu.

12:47.993 --> 12:50.370
And I am an advanced cybernetic organism

12:50.454 --> 12:54.166
with carbon-steel driver cables
and a 20 terabyte memory

12:54.249 --> 12:57.294
loaded with every
fighting system in history.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.673
So I won't need this
to snap you like a twig.

13:04.510 --> 13:07.513
Well, you've gotta catch this running back
before you can snap 'em!

13:09.473 --> 13:13.185
Hmm. Pursue easily reproduced bionoclone

13:13.268 --> 13:16.564
or dispose of Mr. Jones... permanently?

13:16.647 --> 13:18.231
No contest.

13:19.858 --> 13:21.819
That's right, keep coming.

13:31.787 --> 13:33.539
[grunting]

13:36.416 --> 13:40.212
- [groaning]
- I knew you'd fall for me some day.

13:40.295 --> 13:41.880
[Botila thudding]

13:44.592 --> 13:46.176
[snarling]

13:46.760 --> 13:48.178
[Lukas] Easy, girl.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.638
Easy.

13:49.722 --> 13:51.807
The laser net won't hurt you.

13:53.851 --> 13:55.478
Back off, monkey boy.

13:55.561 --> 13:57.771
My bounty ain't getting away this time.

13:58.981 --> 14:00.733
[gasping]

14:09.492 --> 14:10.618
[screeching]

14:10.701 --> 14:11.785
[growling]

14:12.745 --> 14:14.329
[laughing] Yeah!

14:14.412 --> 14:17.165
Talk about catching your quarry
in your sleep!

14:18.000 --> 14:19.417
[liger growls]

14:21.795 --> 14:23.088
No!

14:23.171 --> 14:24.965
- [grunting]
- [growling]

14:26.049 --> 14:27.468
[Kong grunting]

14:29.427 --> 14:31.472
Glad to see you kids made it home safely.

14:31.555 --> 14:33.932
- Lukas?
- Not back yet.

14:34.016 --> 14:36.810
But Amy's been studying
the liger Kong caught

14:36.894 --> 14:39.522
and she says it's not just a clone.

14:39.605 --> 14:41.398
She's packed with bionotech!

14:42.691 --> 14:45.277
Richard just can't stop messing
with Mother Nature.

14:45.360 --> 14:46.654
What about the others?

14:46.737 --> 14:49.573
I got rid of Botila, but lost the liger.

14:49.657 --> 14:51.241
At least I got her off its trail.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.493
[growling]

14:53.494 --> 14:56.121
- [meowing]
- Oh, <i>pobre</i> Lucky.

14:56.204 --> 14:58.832
He must think that she is his real mommy.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.960
Sorry, little guy, but she's not...

15:02.044 --> 15:04.129
- Oh, well, sort of, but...
- [Lucky mews]

15:04.212 --> 15:06.214
I mean... [sighs] Huh.

15:06.298 --> 15:07.382
I don't know what I mean.

15:07.465 --> 15:08.466
[whining]

15:09.760 --> 15:12.429
[Panchi gasps]
Lucky, careful, she could...

15:14.139 --> 15:15.473
[chuckling]

15:15.558 --> 15:17.518
Love you to death.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.522
- [growling]
- [chuckling] Okay!

15:21.605 --> 15:23.607
Family moment. I get it.

15:26.860 --> 15:27.986
Hey, look!

15:30.113 --> 15:33.200
I'll bet she picked up Lucky's scent
and followed it here.

15:36.537 --> 15:38.706
Botila, what's taking you so long?

15:38.789 --> 15:42.084
We need to be ready when my brother
tries to take the bait.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.752
I am here.

15:43.836 --> 15:45.921
Good! Did you get the other cat? I...

15:46.004 --> 15:47.464
- [gasping]
- [crackling]

15:47.548 --> 15:50.008
What do you think?

15:52.427 --> 15:55.848
Okay, we know we need to get
the last liger from Kong Island,

15:55.931 --> 15:57.515
but we need a solid plan.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.061
Uh-oh, I know that look.

16:09.194 --> 16:10.571
[grunting]

16:13.448 --> 16:15.826
Oh, he's heading towards Kong Island!

16:15.909 --> 16:17.953
We better get Lukas and Jonesy!

16:18.036 --> 16:20.247
No time!
Kong's gonna need our help.

16:22.124 --> 16:24.542
Then I better call them.
Hey! Where is my phone?

16:24.627 --> 16:27.295
No idea, but I've got... What!

16:27.379 --> 16:30.132
Mine's gone, too. Chatter!

16:30.215 --> 16:32.676
Bawk! Say cheese! Bawk!

16:42.895 --> 16:44.897
[hooting]

16:44.980 --> 16:46.314
Panchi, look!

16:47.149 --> 16:48.859
- There she is!
- [electricity crackling]

16:48.942 --> 16:50.235
Do you think it's a trap?

16:50.318 --> 16:52.696
Hello! It's always a trap.

16:52.780 --> 16:54.615
That's just part of the deal.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.244
Richard will definitely set a trap.

16:59.327 --> 17:02.414
And... we'll need to stay away
from the water to avoid the giant squid.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.585
[growling]

17:07.670 --> 17:09.253
- [both gasping]
- [growls]

17:12.715 --> 17:15.176
How can a squid be out of the water?

17:15.260 --> 17:17.721
Hello! It's not really a squid!

17:17.805 --> 17:19.181
Duh, right.

17:19.263 --> 17:21.391
The element of surprise is crucial.

17:21.473 --> 17:24.352
Stealth is our best weapon
against Richard's superior forces.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.521
We've gotta be silent as ninjas.

17:26.604 --> 17:28.106
[roaring]

17:33.528 --> 17:36.657
[Jonesy] We can bypass his cameras
here and here.

17:36.740 --> 17:39.326
Richard will never even see us.

17:39.409 --> 17:41.161
[Richard laughing]

17:41.244 --> 17:43.747
Dumb monkey doesn't even
know when he's beaten.

17:43.831 --> 17:46.667
Perhaps because
you have not yet succeeded.

17:52.881 --> 17:55.008
- [grunting]
- [whirring]

18:02.683 --> 18:06.311
Ready for a bath, you dirty ape?

18:11.817 --> 18:13.276
[grunting]

18:15.195 --> 18:16.571
[groaning]

18:16.654 --> 18:17.655
No!

18:21.910 --> 18:23.370
[roaring]

18:23.453 --> 18:27.624
Oh, whoops. I forgot.
You can't swim.

18:30.878 --> 18:32.504
You're an ape, Kong.

18:32.587 --> 18:33.922
Swing like one!

18:34.006 --> 18:35.590
[grunting]

18:44.057 --> 18:45.308
[roaring]

18:52.232 --> 18:53.734
[both chuckling]

18:55.193 --> 18:56.694
[whirring]

19:07.705 --> 19:10.500
No! What just happened?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.919
Simply stated,

19:12.002 --> 19:13.837
I believe you failed...

19:13.921 --> 19:15.255
again.

19:17.465 --> 19:21.136
I seem to be surrounded by failures.

19:29.061 --> 19:31.855
Okay, the plan is solid.
Let's do it!

19:37.069 --> 19:40.197
[Panchi chuckles nervously]
Kong didn't want to wait.

19:41.156 --> 19:42.199
[grunting]

19:42.282 --> 19:45.618
We couldn't call because
Chatter swiped our phones again.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.331
Bawk! Pretty bird!

19:50.874 --> 19:52.042
[Lucky whimpering]

19:54.920 --> 19:57.464
You two know you shouldn't have
gone without one of us.

19:57.547 --> 19:58.590
- Yes.
- <i>Si.</i>

19:58.673 --> 20:01.009
And you'll never do it again, right?

20:01.093 --> 20:02.094
- Right.
- <i>Si.</i>

20:02.177 --> 20:04.096
I still think our plan was solid.

20:12.562 --> 20:15.690
Now that Amy's disabled the bionotech
inside the ligers,

20:15.773 --> 20:16.984
Jonesy and I are gonna take them

20:17.067 --> 20:18.986
to a remote location
where they'll be safe.

20:19.069 --> 20:21.738
And where we know there are
still a couple male tigers.

20:21.822 --> 20:24.157
So these three lovely ladies
won't be lonely.

20:24.241 --> 20:27.911
[giggling] Sounds like you might have
some brothers and sisters soon.

20:27.995 --> 20:29.287
[purring]

20:32.332 --> 20:35.293
Lucky's torn between staying here
with you, Kong...

20:35.377 --> 20:38.296
- [grunting]
- ...or going to live with his three moms.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.673
[hooting]

20:40.757 --> 20:43.718
Kong says whatever Lucky wants
is fine with him,

20:43.801 --> 20:46.013
but he'll miss him a lot if he leaves.

20:47.973 --> 20:49.432
[Kong sighs]

20:49.516 --> 20:51.559
[Panchi] We'll miss him, too.

20:57.565 --> 20:58.691
Lucky!

20:59.817 --> 21:01.444
[chittering]

21:03.821 --> 21:06.241
Don't worry, little guy,
one of these days...

21:06.324 --> 21:08.701
we'll all go visit
your three moms in the wild!

21:08.785 --> 21:09.870
[purring]

21:09.953 --> 21:13.581
Danny, what if Richard uses Lady's DNA

21:13.665 --> 21:15.833
to make more bionoclones?

21:19.171 --> 21:21.173
