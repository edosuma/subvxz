of the queer community

that they still face.

in her new project.

By touching her belly
and discussing family,

16:11.304 --> 16:14.074
this peace response
to French law that prohibits

16:14.107 --> 16:16.743
assisted reproduction
for single and queer women.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.290
It's been a while. It's probably
been like three years.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.427
You know, I think if I were

16:34.461 --> 16:36.396
so deeply connected
to a lesbian couple

16:36.429 --> 16:39.032
that really wanted
to have a child,

16:39.066 --> 16:40.500
let's say like my friend Ellen,

16:40.533 --> 16:43.303
if she decided that she wanted
to have a kid

16:43.336 --> 16:45.272
and she needed sperm,

16:45.305 --> 16:48.608
I have thought about,
would I give her my sperm?

16:48.641 --> 16:52.045
I would potentially
think about donating.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.613
Okay, thank you.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.483
Was that good? Okay.
[ Laughs ] Superb!

16:56.516 --> 16:58.718
Can you tell me more about
the project you are working on?

17:14.101 --> 17:17.104
I would love to know more about
your personal experience

17:17.137 --> 17:18.371
with getting pregnant

17:18.405 --> 17:20.240
and the things
you had to go through

17:20.273 --> 17:23.343
to sit here with that belly?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.357
Can you tell me more
about what's going on

17:37.390 --> 17:39.392
with the reproductive rights
in France?

18:32.345 --> 18:34.814
When you think about France
in the future,

18:34.847 --> 18:38.518
do you see that LGBTQ people
and other minorities

18:38.551 --> 18:41.654
will actually get
to full equality?

18:59.306 --> 19:00.573
Control over one's body

19:00.607 --> 19:02.809
without government
or social stigma,

19:02.842 --> 19:05.345
is a fight shared
by countless queer women

19:05.378 --> 19:09.249
as well as transgender people
in the country.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.551
Today, there is still
legislation in place

19:11.584 --> 19:13.353
that demands sterilization

19:13.386 --> 19:15.722
in order to legally
confirm one's gender.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.460
A new wave of transgender
activists in France

19:20.493 --> 19:23.830
are fighting against this law
through participation in marches

19:23.863 --> 19:26.966
like the upcoming Night Pride
and through smaller gatherings

19:26.999 --> 19:30.770
that aim to strengthen
and empower the trans community.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.974
There is this association
in Paris called Acceptess Trans,

19:35.007 --> 19:38.545
and they host this
weekly meet-up at a pool

19:38.578 --> 19:40.980
where queer and trans people
can get together

19:41.013 --> 19:43.683
and swim in
a judgment-free zone,

19:43.716 --> 19:46.586
and I'm going to go in now
and check it out.

19:46.619 --> 19:50.223
It's run by trans-activist,
Giovanna Rincon.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.791
The meet-up that you're
having this evening,

19:51.824 --> 19:52.959
what is it exactly?

20:05.638 --> 20:06.939
Why the pool?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.027
Let's do it, yeah.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.696
I'm ready.

**

20:47.947 --> 20:49.849
Can you describe your experience

20:49.882 --> 20:52.619
of being trans
and young and male

20:52.652 --> 20:54.287
in Paris and in France?

21:26.686 --> 21:28.388
Within the LGBT community,

21:28.421 --> 21:30.990
do you feel that you're seen
and that you're heard

21:31.023 --> 21:33.660
and that you are part
of the community?

22:37.056 --> 22:38.658
Daniel:
There is some acceptance

22:38.691 --> 22:40.827
for the gay community
within France.

[ Woman singing in French ]

22:43.763 --> 22:46.666
But other LGBTQ people
are still fighting

22:46.699 --> 22:48.735
for a place
within the mainstream.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.537
I'm meeting up again
with my friend,

22:50.570 --> 22:53.473
journalist Edwin Nasr
to continue our conversation

22:53.506 --> 22:55.675
about the minority
experience within France

22:55.708 --> 22:57.910
and the LGBTQ community.

22:57.944 --> 23:01.481
Allow me.
Okay, thank you.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.583
What do you think
are the biggest issues

23:03.616 --> 23:07.954
that the LGBTQ community
faces in France?

23:07.987 --> 23:09.656
It's LGBTQ people of color

23:09.689 --> 23:12.058
because they're never
a part of a conversation.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.726
It's also visibility.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.928
It's harder to talk about
these things in France

23:15.962 --> 23:22.802
because identity politics
isn't really that respected.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.504
So, even like seeing
people of color

23:24.537 --> 23:26.038
is offensive to a normal
French person.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.674
So they don't speak of --

23:27.707 --> 23:29.976
They have
a color-blind attitude.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.845
They don't acknowledge
multiple narratives.

23:32.879 --> 23:35.882
There is one national
common narrative,

23:35.915 --> 23:37.950
which is like this
constant universalist,

23:37.984 --> 23:40.119
you're either French
or you're not, and that's it.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.589
You don't get to have
your own experiences.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.892
And people who don't fit
into this are usually

23:45.925 --> 23:48.895
just marginalized.

23:48.928 --> 23:52.632
Mm-hmm. Are you one of the rare
voices in that conversation?

23:52.665 --> 23:54.200
Are there a lot of people
talking about that?

23:54.233 --> 23:55.968
There are some people
talking about that,

23:56.002 --> 23:57.670
they aren't much.

23:57.704 --> 24:01.708
I focus on LGBT people
who do not live in the city

24:01.741 --> 24:05.011
but who live in, like,
what you American folks

24:05.044 --> 24:06.646
would call the projects,
I guess,

24:06.679 --> 24:07.947
on the outskirts of Paris,

24:07.980 --> 24:10.082
people who haven't
been given a chance

24:10.116 --> 24:12.251
to be really be open
about their sexuality

24:12.284 --> 24:16.489
because they live in
very disenfranchised places

24:16.523 --> 24:19.058
where the government has
completely forgotten about them.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.729
And why do you feel personally
connected to that kind of work?

24:22.762 --> 24:25.598
When I first came here
and gay marriage was legalized,

24:25.632 --> 24:29.001
I saw lot of gay people
just telling themselves,

24:29.035 --> 24:32.004
"Well, let's just stop there,
we got all our rights,

24:32.038 --> 24:33.506
we are equal now."
Mm-hmm.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.675
But then I saw
how, like, LGBTQ people

24:35.708 --> 24:39.011
lived in the suburbs
and the projects basically.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.013
And so I just really wanted
to find the intersection

24:41.047 --> 24:45.017
between, like, poverty
and LGBTQ issues

24:45.051 --> 24:46.619
because they do
really intersect

24:46.653 --> 24:49.589
and because coming out
really is a privilege,

24:49.622 --> 24:51.591
and living your life
as a free gay man

24:51.624 --> 24:54.627
or a free gay woman
really is a privilege, as well.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.129
So that's why I wanted
to write about this stuff.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.565
I know your
boyfriend's here,

24:58.598 --> 24:59.899
not that we have
to put him on camera,

24:59.932 --> 25:04.871

See, what a cute couple.

So nice to meet you.
You too.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.179
And are you openly
walking around...
Yes.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.014
...and holding hands
and hanging out....

25:15.047 --> 25:16.649
In Paris we are.
Yes, yes.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.585
A way to protect
ourselves from racism

25:18.618 --> 25:21.854
is to basically be
very, very gay together

25:21.888 --> 25:24.223
in public spaces
so that we aren't seen

25:24.256 --> 25:25.592
as this potential threat.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.893
We aren't bestialized
or demonized

25:26.926 --> 25:29.128
as these, like,
masculine, Arab men.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.563
It's a race issue,
as well.

25:30.597 --> 25:33.700
It's not only a like
anti-Islam thing.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.071
Daniel: I'm leaving
the center of the city

25:39.105 --> 25:40.907
and headed to
the suburbs of Paris,

25:40.940 --> 25:43.876
known here as the banlieue.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.978
These areas are home
to the majority

25:46.012 --> 25:50.316
of Paris' ethnic and religious
minority communities.

25:50.349 --> 25:51.851
Those to the northeast
of the city

25:51.884 --> 25:53.753
have come to be associated

25:53.786 --> 25:57.056
with what the French government
calls "sensitive urban zones"

25:57.089 --> 25:58.891
or areas where there
is high unemployment

25:58.925 --> 26:01.694
and poverty rates.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.096
And so, the residents
of the banlieue

26:04.130 --> 26:06.833
often deal with
intersecting cultural stigmas

26:06.866 --> 26:10.102
against immigration,
religion, and poverty.

26:24.183 --> 26:27.119
I'm going to a class held
by Abdelkader Railane,

26:27.153 --> 26:29.722
who grew up in the suburbs
and now teaches a course

26:29.756 --> 26:33.325
aimed at deconstructing
discrimination.

26:33.359 --> 26:36.696
Young people from the area
who apply for government aid

26:36.729 --> 26:38.831
attend the class.

[ Laughter ]

28:53.165 --> 28:54.466
And she said what?

28:58.137 --> 28:59.806
Mm-hmm.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.442
No.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.157
I'm just curious
about people's families

29:18.190 --> 29:20.159
and what if you went home

29:20.192 --> 29:21.560
and told your family
that you were gay?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.162
What would their reaction be?

29:45.417 --> 29:47.319
What about you?
What would your family say?

30:06.272 --> 30:08.240
How long? My whole life.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.081
I think the important thing
for me to say

30:15.114 --> 30:17.249
is that I don't live here.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.518
I don't know about
your lives necessarily

30:19.551 --> 30:21.320
but I'm from a small town,

30:21.353 --> 30:23.489
so I'm used to this
conversation, right.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.224
To me, the things
that people are saying here

30:25.257 --> 30:26.959
are actually pretty typical.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.628
I studied abroad in Paris
when I was young,

30:29.661 --> 30:31.197
I was 20 years old,

30:31.230 --> 30:33.499
and I was not out
with my sexuality,

30:33.532 --> 30:36.402
I was in fact
struggling with it,

30:36.435 --> 30:37.970
struggling with what
people would say

30:38.004 --> 30:39.438
and how I would be treated?

30:39.471 --> 30:43.242
And so I'm imagining my old self
sitting in this room

30:43.275 --> 30:46.045
and hearing the things
that I heard today,

30:46.078 --> 30:48.247
and I think maybe there's
actually someone in here

30:48.280 --> 30:50.983
who is also
in that same struggle.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.551
But think about
everybody in the room

30:52.584 --> 30:54.386
and how they might
potentially be offended

30:54.420 --> 30:56.055
or hurt by what you say.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.157
Those kind of words
and those kind of statements

30:58.190 --> 31:01.627
actually do lead
to the killing and murder

31:01.660 --> 31:04.530
and violence of other people,

31:04.563 --> 31:06.966
and we should reflect
on that more.

on the spot there.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.554
I was not -- I truthfully
was not expecting that.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.656
But, you know, I am actually
really happy that you did that.

31:30.689 --> 31:34.093
It was a very eye-opening
experience for me

31:34.126 --> 31:37.029
and surely for them,
I'm thinking. Hopefully.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.309
You were talking
about your past

31:50.342 --> 31:53.645
and your past being
racist and homophobic.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.214
What was the turning point

31:55.247 --> 31:57.383
for you towards
a more accepting attitude?

32:11.630 --> 32:14.033
I thank you so much for
the experience that I had today,

and for sharing your change
of heart and working so hard

32:18.770 --> 32:21.573
to help other people change
their hearts and their minds.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.321
Daniel:
French colonial policy

32:35.354 --> 32:37.656
was rooted in the concept
of assimilation,

32:37.689 --> 32:40.426
and that history has created
a population of people

32:40.459 --> 32:42.394
who have been born
into French culture

32:42.428 --> 32:44.530
though they were not
born on its soil.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.172
The recent wave
of terrorist attacks

32:53.205 --> 32:55.241
as well as
the European refugee crisis

32:55.274 --> 32:56.775
has inflamed national debate

32:56.808 --> 32:59.111
about what it means
to be French.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.586
I'm meeting with Nassr Eddine,
a Moroccan-born Imam

33:07.619 --> 33:10.689
to hear about how being
an immigrant, Muslim, and gay

33:10.722 --> 33:13.225
have affected his experience
within France

33:13.259 --> 33:17.229
and the LGBTQ community.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.598
In the street I'm not
really profiled as gay,

33:19.631 --> 33:22.768
so I'm facing more
Islamophobia in the street.

33:22.801 --> 33:26.205
For example, when something,
a terrorist attack

33:26.238 --> 33:30.542
happens in Paris, people
pointing, like, looking at me

33:30.576 --> 33:33.412
as a stranger or as an enemy

33:33.445 --> 33:36.815
or someone who doesn't fit
in this secular society.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.151
And in France,
we have secularism,

33:39.185 --> 33:41.720
and some interpretations
of this are very narrow-minded.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.156
And this is for me,
an Islamophobic,

33:44.190 --> 33:45.657
neo-colonial thought,
which is happening

33:45.691 --> 33:47.559
in the LGBT community,
also.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.228
You're saying, though,
that the LGBT community

33:49.261 --> 33:53.332
is not giving you space
in that conversation.

33:53.365 --> 33:57.769
When you read a statement
for the 2016 Pride, for example,

33:57.803 --> 33:59.571
they don't talk
about racism we face,

33:59.605 --> 34:01.273
they don't talk about
Islamophobia we face,

34:01.307 --> 34:02.741
they don't talk about
police violence,

34:02.774 --> 34:04.610
they don't talk about
ethnic profiling,

34:04.643 --> 34:07.413
they don't talk about
refugees and asylum seekers.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.181
So for me, very important

34:09.215 --> 34:12.384
to talk about intersectionality
because we face it.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.320
How do you feel about

34:14.353 --> 34:16.488
being legalized here?

34:16.522 --> 34:18.224
I'm happy that it
is legalized.

34:18.257 --> 34:21.860
Works for some people,
but because France signed

34:21.893 --> 34:25.131
before years ago kind of
bilateral conventions,

34:25.164 --> 34:26.865
11 nationalities are still
excluded from that,

34:26.898 --> 34:28.767
from that law.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.871
So me being Moroccan, I cannot
marry, for example, my partner.

34:32.904 --> 34:37.243
This is very contradictory,
that a law that normally

34:37.276 --> 34:41.413
brings equality still
actually being discriminatory

34:41.447 --> 34:44.383
against, I mean,
a few nationalities.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.453
And what do you think exactly
has to change in France

34:47.486 --> 34:49.188
for you to be more accepted

34:49.221 --> 34:51.123
and not face
so much discrimination?

34:51.157 --> 34:55.394
What I advocate or fighting
for is to educate people

34:55.427 --> 34:56.528
on intersectionality.

34:56.562 --> 34:57.763
It's a double duty.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.531
Me being Muslim,
I have to actually

34:59.565 --> 35:02.501
feel others struggles
and have to be with them.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.870
My challenge
is to build bridges

35:04.903 --> 35:07.539
so that people
can teach themselves

35:07.573 --> 35:09.375
but also teach others

35:09.408 --> 35:12.311
because if we are
not enough empowered

35:12.344 --> 35:14.146
on a civil society level,

35:14.180 --> 35:17.916
we cannot actually have weight
towards politicians,

35:17.949 --> 35:20.352
and this is actually
the biggest challenge.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.423
Daniel: There is a rising
political tide

35:24.456 --> 35:26.225
that's against multi-culturalism

35:26.258 --> 35:30.796
led by the National Front,
France's conservative party.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.265
They believe in a massive
reduction of immigrants,

35:33.299 --> 35:35.667
promotion of traditional
family values,

35:35.701 --> 35:37.903
and maintaining
an undivided France.

35:42.741 --> 35:45.644
The recent wave of terrorist
attacks in France has fueled

35:45.677 --> 35:47.813
the National Front's popularity.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.549
And surprisingly,
a recent survey pointed out

35:50.582 --> 35:53.885
that 32% of gay couples
voted for the FN

35:53.919 --> 35:57.155
during the regional elections
in 2015.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.428
That year,
the party won 12 cities,

36:02.461 --> 36:06.198
one of which was Beaucaire
in the south of the country.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.369
I'm on my way there
to meet its mayor,

36:10.402 --> 36:11.770
Julian Sanchez,

36:11.803 --> 36:15.707
a rising star within the FN.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.676
Thank you so much
for talking with me today,

36:17.709 --> 36:20.178
and you're
a very young mayor, yes?

36:27.686 --> 36:29.855
Being such a young mayor,
do you think it's important

36:29.888 --> 36:31.957
for young people
to get involved in politics?

36:46.505 --> 36:48.274
Tell me more about
the National Front.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.242
What does
the National Front stand for?

36:50.276 --> 36:51.577
What are its ideologies?

37:16.868 --> 37:18.770
I'm wondering
how diversity fits into

37:18.804 --> 37:20.005
what you are talking about?

37:31.550 --> 37:33.785
I think on the one hand,
maybe some people would say

37:33.819 --> 37:35.521
that your party is homophobic

37:35.554 --> 37:38.857
because of its stance
originally on gay marriage

37:38.890 --> 37:43.629
and some of the anti-LGBT
laws that are in place

37:43.662 --> 37:45.764
and potentially going to be
put into place.

37:45.797 --> 37:48.667
And at the same time,
there is support

37:48.700 --> 37:50.936
from the LGBTQ community
for your party.

37:50.969 --> 37:54.005
How is that possible,
and why do you think that is?

38:25.937 --> 38:27.406
Hm.

38:49.395 --> 38:52.431
What do you say to a woman
who is a lesbian

38:52.464 --> 38:53.799
and wants to have a child?

38:53.832 --> 38:57.102
She would be a beautiful mother,
but she can't --

38:57.135 --> 39:00.038
she can't do that here and she
has to go to another country.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.656
I'm interested
in the conversation

39:17.689 --> 39:19.157
around LGBTQ people,

39:19.190 --> 39:21.727
and I'm wondering how minorities
have a voice then

39:21.760 --> 39:24.162
if they -- if they feel like
they need to be heard

39:24.195 --> 39:26.064
to make changes for their lives

39:26.097 --> 39:27.766
but they don't have
a place to do that?

39:27.799 --> 39:29.768
And they are not considered
in the conversation,

39:29.801 --> 39:31.770
how do you think
they get a voice?

39:38.577 --> 39:41.179
There are things that you say
just in their subtlety

39:41.212 --> 39:45.684
that is a disregard
for the issues that people face.

40:03.602 --> 40:07.939
Daniel:
I am here experiencing Paris

40:07.973 --> 40:10.542
in a new way and France
in a new way,

40:10.576 --> 40:12.210
and I think
the interesting part is,

40:12.243 --> 40:15.847
is that I've been meeting
so many radical, intelligent,

40:15.881 --> 40:17.849
passionate young people

40:17.883 --> 40:20.185
that were my age
when I studied here,

40:20.218 --> 40:22.220
and they have been
teaching me so much.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.789
And they are really
helping me understand

40:23.822 --> 40:26.091
how to politicize
your experience.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.660
And they realize that if they
have a voice in politics,

40:28.694 --> 40:30.529
it can change things.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.964
When Pride started,
it was a protest.

40:32.998 --> 40:36.067
They risked a lot
stepping out into the street,

40:36.101 --> 40:37.669
asserting their sexuality,

40:37.703 --> 40:39.605
making it political,

40:39.638 --> 40:42.708
and making what
was invisible visible.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.646
That energy is being reclaimed
through Pride de Nuit,

40:47.679 --> 40:50.549
and the march is today.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.183
Pride de Nuit brings the issues

40:52.217 --> 40:55.854
of marginalized queer
communities to the forefront.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.890
It's a place where those voices
who have been silenced

40:58.924 --> 41:03.128
can be heard, and this year's
is bigger than ever.

41:03.161 --> 41:04.996
I mean, how are you
feeling right now?

41:05.030 --> 41:09.034
Describe to me what you think
the energy in the air is like?

41:09.067 --> 41:10.602
I'm very happy to see

41:10.636 --> 41:13.271
just how, like,
diverse the crowd is,

41:13.304 --> 41:16.141
because I did not expect this
two to three years ago.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.810
I thought the LGBT community
was a lost cause

41:18.844 --> 41:20.278
in terms of politicization.

41:20.311 --> 41:25.283
And just to see them all
very, like, excited to be here

41:25.316 --> 41:27.218
and vocalizing
very radical demands

41:27.252 --> 41:30.589
is just -- yeah, it fills
my heart with joy.

It can be political,
it can be loud,

it can be aggressive
without politics.

Interesting because
of its diversity.
