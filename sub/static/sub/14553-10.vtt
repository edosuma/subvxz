00:52.164 --> 00:54.029
I just think there's people that...

00:54.154 --> 00:56.075
If your life, you know,

00:56.200 --> 00:57.565
if it's good enough,
you should just shut up.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.186
There's just some people that
complain when they don't...

00:59.311 --> 01:00.311
they shouldn't.

01:00.436 --> 01:02.849
I have two kids and I think
about them sometimes

01:02.974 --> 01:05.897
and that... like, I got two
little white girls in my house.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.044
That's a reality.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.572
These are two little white girls.

01:10.697 --> 01:13.348
On paper, they're doing awesome,

01:13.468 --> 01:16.418
just by who they are
and where they are,

01:16.543 --> 01:19.489
so when they complain,
it kinda drives me crazy,

01:19.614 --> 01:21.635
because I know what the world is
like around them.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.254
They have no idea.

01:23.379 --> 01:24.838
I gave my daughter
medicine the other day.

01:24.963 --> 01:26.239
She had a fever, so I gave her
Tylenol

01:26.364 --> 01:28.708
and it's bubble-gum flavored,

01:28.833 --> 01:31.297
so that she'll take it.

01:31.557 --> 01:34.871
What kind of an
upside-down society is this?

01:34.996 --> 01:37.050
Oh, how are we gonna
get these children

01:37.175 --> 01:40.453
to take these miracle drugs?

01:40.578 --> 01:42.512
We better add candy to it.

01:45.950 --> 01:47.159
I gave her the bubble-gum medicine,

01:47.284 --> 01:48.461
she goes, "Ew!"

01:48.586 --> 01:51.565
I'm like, ( bleep ) you, ew!

01:51.690 --> 01:54.501
Are you shitting me?

01:54.626 --> 01:56.794
That's medicine!

01:58.817 --> 02:01.409
Most kids in the world
don't have medicine,

02:01.534 --> 02:03.473
they just don't have it.

02:03.598 --> 02:06.114
When they get sick,
they just... they die on a rock

02:06.239 --> 02:07.749
with a bear eating their face,

02:07.874 --> 02:10.957
that's how most of
the world handles that.

02:16.679 --> 02:17.789
No, he's got a sniffle,

02:17.914 --> 02:20.049
ring the bear bell
and put him outside.

02:23.187 --> 02:26.032
You're a white kid eating
bubble-gum medicine.

02:26.157 --> 02:27.333
You're wearing clothes

02:27.458 --> 02:29.993
made by children your age,
professionally.

02:34.433 --> 02:35.256
Sorry.

02:35.381 --> 02:39.013
Americans only buy things
that come from suffering.

02:39.138 --> 02:41.149
They just enjoy it more

02:41.274 --> 02:43.141
when they know someone's
getting hurt.

02:50.994 --> 02:52.713
Try in here.

02:54.563 --> 02:56.737
Hi.

02:56.857 --> 02:58.434
Trick or treat!
Hi, trick or treat!

02:58.559 --> 03:00.870
Oh, my God, they're so cute!

03:00.995 --> 03:01.771
What are you?

03:01.896 --> 03:03.238
I'm a fairy.

03:03.363 --> 03:05.874
Oh, nice, a fairy,
have a candy, here.

03:05.999 --> 03:07.342
Thank you.

03:07.467 --> 03:09.077
And what are you?

03:09.202 --> 03:11.203
Frederick Douglass.

03:12.973 --> 03:15.341
She read a book
about Frederick Douglass.

03:16.843 --> 03:18.253
Okay.

03:18.378 --> 03:20.189
Thanks, girls.

03:20.314 --> 03:22.248
Bye!
Bye, thank you! Thank you, bye-bye.

03:26.720 --> 03:27.996
What are you doing?

03:28.121 --> 03:29.722
I'm just taking one, come one.

03:35.862 --> 03:37.506
Daddy, my beard itches.

03:37.631 --> 03:38.731
Here you go.

03:40.267 --> 03:41.376
All right, go on in there.

03:41.501 --> 03:42.511
Trick or treat!

03:42.636 --> 03:44.103
Trick or treat!

03:47.207 --> 03:48.383
Ugh...

03:48.508 --> 03:49.751
Guys, we gotta...
This is it.

03:49.876 --> 03:51.486
We're late and it's time to go home.

03:51.611 --> 03:53.254
Let's go home now, okay?
Aw, come on, Daddy.

03:53.379 --> 03:55.023
Can we please stay out
a little longer?

03:55.148 --> 03:57.092
I can't have you
out here in the dark.

03:57.217 --> 03:59.495
But Mommy always lets us
trick-or-treat after dark

03:59.620 --> 04:01.730
when it's her turn to
have us on Halloween.

04:01.855 --> 04:03.031
Jane, I know that's not true.

04:03.156 --> 04:04.590
No, it isn't.

04:05.556 --> 04:07.536
Daddy!

04:07.661 --> 04:08.837
What?

04:08.962 --> 04:11.397
Can we please stay out
a little longer?

04:13.433 --> 04:14.743
All right, let's hit
a few more stores.

04:14.868 --> 04:16.111
Yay!
Yay!

04:16.236 --> 04:17.412
Yes!
All right, come on.

04:17.537 --> 04:18.670
Crazy.

04:23.576 --> 04:25.386
Daddy, these people are scary.

04:25.511 --> 04:27.655
Baby, they're just costumes,
let's just get home.

04:27.780 --> 04:28.846
We'll be okay.

04:33.985 --> 04:36.362
Thanks a lot, you asshole!

04:36.487 --> 04:38.431
Girls, girls, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

04:38.556 --> 04:39.665
It's okay.

04:39.790 --> 04:41.800
Listen, girls, let's just get home.

04:41.925 --> 04:43.402
None of this is real, you understand?

04:43.527 --> 04:45.037
None of it's real.

04:45.162 --> 04:46.939
Let's get home and brush all
that sugar out of your teeth.

04:47.064 --> 04:48.341
Come on, come on.

04:48.466 --> 04:49.467
Let's go.

04:50.787 --> 04:52.263
You know, someday
you girls are probably

04:52.388 --> 04:54.700
gonna dress in scary costumes.

04:54.825 --> 04:57.203
You know, when you're teenagers.

04:57.328 --> 04:59.572
It's... it's like scary movies.

04:59.697 --> 05:01.508
People like to scare each other.

05:01.633 --> 05:02.943
Yeah, exactly.
It's just fun.

05:03.068 --> 05:05.812
It's just fun, baby, that's right.

05:05.937 --> 05:08.572
Halloween.
Right.

05:10.208 --> 05:11.842
Daddy?

05:13.445 --> 05:14.922
It's okay, don't worry about it.

05:15.047 --> 05:16.657
Hi.

05:16.782 --> 05:18.892
Daddy, why are we walking faster?

05:19.017 --> 05:20.226
Hi!
Just, let's go.

05:20.351 --> 05:22.462
It's all right.
It's okay.

05:22.587 --> 05:25.364
What's wrong, Daddy?

05:25.489 --> 05:26.890
It's just pre...

05:46.646 --> 05:48.122
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

05:48.247 --> 05:49.581
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

05:52.651 --> 05:54.962
I think we lost 'em.

05:55.087 --> 05:57.231
It's okay, come on.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.256
We'll go to bed, we'll be fine.

06:00.747 --> 06:02.160
Jesus.

06:03.958 --> 06:06.806
We came around the corner
and scared you.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.808
We scared you.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.910
Daddy, this isn't pretend.

06:11.035 --> 06:12.612
This is scary.

06:12.737 --> 06:13.713
Oh, no, no, no, it is pretend.

06:13.838 --> 06:14.848
These guys are pretending.

06:14.973 --> 06:16.849
We are?

06:16.974 --> 06:18.350
Yeah, you... you...

06:18.475 --> 06:20.253
They're pretending and they're
gonna let us go, right?

06:20.378 --> 06:21.621
They're just gonna let us go.

06:21.746 --> 06:23.790
We're gonna let you go?

06:23.915 --> 06:24.758
Let you go?

06:24.883 --> 06:26.760
Well, what if we don't wanna?

06:26.885 --> 06:29.595
Yeah, what if we don't...
what if we don't wanna?

06:29.720 --> 06:32.331
What are you gonna do, Daddy?

06:32.456 --> 06:34.633
Oh, girls, your daddy is brave.

06:34.758 --> 06:36.735
He is brave.

06:36.860 --> 06:39.104
He doesn't want to show it,
but he's scared inside.

06:39.229 --> 06:43.407
He's... he's frozen, like...
he's frozen like a lollipop.

06:43.532 --> 06:45.043
Come on, man, you don't wanna...
He's frozen.

06:45.168 --> 06:46.281
You don't wanna hurt these kids.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.406
You guys are better than that, right?

06:47.531 --> 06:48.813
I mean, you...
Oh, no, no...

06:48.938 --> 06:49.948
These are two little girls, you know?

06:50.073 --> 06:51.783
I don't... I don't want to
hurt any kids,

06:51.908 --> 06:56.412
you're right, I don't,
but... but Giant here, he's...

06:57.915 --> 06:59.282
He's scary.

07:04.556 --> 07:07.667
I think I'm about to do
something bad.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.602
I think I'm about to
do something real bad

07:09.727 --> 07:12.505
to these people.

07:12.630 --> 07:15.809
Hey, stop it!

07:15.934 --> 07:19.179
Being scary is not nice!

07:19.304 --> 07:21.681
Halloween's for fun!

07:21.806 --> 07:22.949
You're supposed to have a nice time,

07:23.074 --> 07:24.884
dress up and get candy!

07:25.009 --> 07:26.568
It's not nice to scare people.

07:26.944 --> 07:29.789
And you shouldn't scare my
daddy, either!

07:29.914 --> 07:33.194
Stop it right now!

07:33.319 --> 07:35.167
Girls, go over there.

07:35.292 --> 07:36.292
Daddy, don't!

07:36.417 --> 07:37.856
Daddy, don't!

07:52.225 --> 07:53.226
You okay?

07:53.351 --> 07:54.482
What do we do now?

07:54.607 --> 07:56.584
We're gonna wait for
the police to come,

07:56.709 --> 07:58.886
we're gonna tell them what happened

07:59.011 --> 08:01.756
and we're gonna pay for the window.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.983
Whoa, Daddy, how did
you know to do that?

08:09.421 --> 08:11.331
You were very brave.

08:11.456 --> 08:13.290
I'm happy you're good, too.

08:43.345 --> 08:44.589
Hey, hey, everybody?

08:44.714 --> 08:46.057
Everyone?

08:46.182 --> 08:47.593
Hi.

08:47.718 --> 08:49.461
Hey there.

08:49.586 --> 08:52.431
I want to thank
all of you for being here

08:52.556 --> 08:56.068
for the round-table rewrite
of "Out of Here."

08:56.193 --> 08:58.371
I'm Eddie Faye
and I wrote the script.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.107
This is Jordan, who's directing.

09:01.232 --> 09:03.309
We start principal
photog in about two weeks

09:03.434 --> 09:07.313
and we're basically here to
try to inject some funny

09:07.438 --> 09:08.981
back into the script,

09:09.106 --> 09:12.317
which was sapped out by all
the notes and story fixes.

09:12.442 --> 09:13.852
You're all here

09:13.977 --> 09:16.054
because you're funny and you
were all willing to work

09:16.179 --> 09:18.057
for the favored nation's 5,000 each

09:18.182 --> 09:20.026
plus croissants and jelly.

09:20.151 --> 09:21.818
Okay, page one.

09:25.657 --> 09:27.634
"Interior: bedroom; morning.

09:27.759 --> 09:31.371
"Angle on alarm clock,
it reads 6:59 a.m.

09:31.496 --> 09:33.641
"It changes to 7:00
and the alarm goes off.

09:33.766 --> 09:35.676
"It's a loud, annoying buzz.

09:35.801 --> 09:37.078
"A hand appears from offscreen

09:37.203 --> 09:39.580
"and fumbles to
slap down on the snooze bar,

09:39.705 --> 09:42.584
"we follow up the arm and land
on its owner, Mike Bradsky,

09:42.709 --> 09:45.620
"a cop in his 30s.

09:45.745 --> 09:49.290
"Mike:'Ugh, not another
one of these.'

09:49.415 --> 09:51.759
"As Mike rolls over on his
side to go back to sleep,

09:51.884 --> 09:54.695
"his dog comes over
and starts licking his face.

09:54.820 --> 09:57.222
Mike:'Come on, boy,
give me a break.'"

09:59.191 --> 10:01.835
All right, anybody got anything
for page one?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.603
I had instead of
"not another one of these,"

10:03.728 --> 10:05.772
something like, "39 years of
shitty days,

10:05.897 --> 10:07.198
22 years to go."

10:08.400 --> 10:09.509
That's pretty good.

10:09.634 --> 10:11.178
What if he says, like, what are...

10:11.303 --> 10:12.545
You know, when his dog's
licking his face,

10:12.670 --> 10:14.405
what if he says something
like, "Come on, you mutt"?

10:17.576 --> 10:21.245
Or he's like, "What do I look
like, a Gaines-Burger?"

10:24.950 --> 10:25.993
All right, um...

10:26.118 --> 10:27.995
Do we really need another movie

10:28.120 --> 10:29.897
with the alarm clock close-up

10:30.022 --> 10:31.565
and the dog's licking the guy...

10:31.690 --> 10:33.734
I mean, come on, everybody.

10:33.859 --> 10:36.470
This is like every
bad cop movie I've ever seen.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.305
It's just lazy.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.473
Thank you.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.608
Thank you for the teardown, Evan.

10:41.733 --> 10:43.843
But folks are here so they
can add ideas,

10:43.968 --> 10:45.878
so you got a better way to start?

10:46.003 --> 10:47.413
Not really.

10:47.538 --> 10:49.652
Just saying it's lame.

10:49.777 --> 10:50.778
Okay.

10:50.903 --> 10:52.417
Page two.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.710
What if the dog stops the alarm?

10:56.980 --> 10:58.023
That's not bad.

10:58.148 --> 11:00.050
How does he wake up?

11:02.787 --> 11:06.066
I don't know, maybe he doesn't.

11:06.191 --> 11:09.404
I mean, like, if you see
the dog's paw

11:09.529 --> 11:11.273
hits the alarm clock

11:11.398 --> 11:14.943
and then... then you see his
face and he's sleeping.

11:15.068 --> 11:17.880
And then you go back to the
clock and then time goes by

11:18.005 --> 11:19.515
and it's now like 11:00,

11:19.640 --> 11:22.452
and then the guy wakes up
and smiling,

11:22.577 --> 11:23.953
'cause he has no idea how late it is.

11:24.078 --> 11:25.421
That's funny.

11:25.546 --> 11:27.924
He's like, why do I feel so good?

11:28.049 --> 11:29.925
Then he realizes what time
it is, he screams,

11:30.050 --> 11:32.394
he jumps out of bed, except he
forgets he sleeps in a loft bed

11:32.519 --> 11:33.619
and he falls down the stairs.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.165
Yeah, yeah, now,
maybe this is too much,

11:36.290 --> 11:38.034
but at the bottom of the stairs,

11:38.159 --> 11:39.903
maybe he's knocked out cold, right?

11:40.028 --> 11:42.539
And he lays there sleeping
even longer.

11:42.664 --> 11:44.976
Maybe that's where
the dog licks his face.

11:45.101 --> 11:47.678
And now he wakes up again
and he's even later.

11:47.803 --> 11:50.616
We could do, like, an action montage

11:50.741 --> 11:53.986
of him rushing to the station,
he puts on siren,

11:54.111 --> 11:56.989
you know, big chase,
chase, chase, chase, chase.

11:57.114 --> 11:59.558
People run out of way because
he's late for work, maybe.

11:59.683 --> 12:01.793
What if, like,
he's in his car, right?

12:01.918 --> 12:04.396
And he drives into a truck or
whatever, and he's like,

12:04.521 --> 12:06.131
"I'm getting too old for this shit."

12:06.256 --> 12:07.966
You've got to be kidding me.

12:08.091 --> 12:10.334
Not like... not we're, like,
we're actually saying that line,

12:10.459 --> 12:12.403
it's like a joke on the fact
that we're using...

12:12.528 --> 12:14.371
it's like we're making fun
of the fact of how lame it is.

12:14.496 --> 12:15.839
You could keep bringing this dog back

12:15.964 --> 12:17.441
and the dog could keep
screwing up this guy's life

12:17.566 --> 12:19.167
and he's not even aware of it.

12:21.904 --> 12:23.114
That's funny.

12:23.239 --> 12:24.750
But it changes our whole opening.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.084
I mean, that's a lot to produce.

12:26.209 --> 12:27.953
Go ahead and write it, Eddie.

12:28.078 --> 12:30.956
We'll find the money.

12:31.081 --> 12:33.392
Okay.

12:33.517 --> 12:36.595
So...

12:36.720 --> 12:38.354
what happens after he wakes up?

12:45.194 --> 12:46.203
So do you have, like, a method

12:46.328 --> 12:47.304
for coming up with a good joke?

12:47.429 --> 12:48.138
I don't know what to tell you, kid,

12:48.263 --> 12:49.973
I let the jokes come to me.

12:50.098 --> 12:51.975
Hey, man, nice job.
Hey, thank you.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.276
Thanks.

12:53.401 --> 12:54.945
Good work.
Thank you.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.346
Funny stuff, guy.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.182
Thanks, thanks.

12:58.307 --> 12:59.883
Hi, I'm Ellie.

13:00.008 --> 13:01.151
Hi, I'm Louie.

13:01.276 --> 13:02.887
You're a comedian.

13:03.012 --> 13:04.222
Yeah.

13:04.347 --> 13:06.524
Can I buy you lunch?
You know what?

13:06.649 --> 13:07.759
I gotta pick up my kids at school,

13:07.884 --> 13:09.161
so it's not the best time, but...

13:09.286 --> 13:10.329
Well, get a sitter.

13:10.454 --> 13:12.097
This is your future, honey.

13:12.222 --> 13:13.386
Hey, Ellie.

13:13.511 --> 13:14.511
What's up?

13:14.636 --> 13:16.189
Did you read my script?

13:16.314 --> 13:17.314
No, of course not.

13:17.439 --> 13:19.604
It's only your job!

13:19.729 --> 13:21.305
Let's go.

13:21.430 --> 13:22.763
Okay.

13:31.682 --> 13:33.505
Hi, Ms. Bormer.
Hey, Harry.

13:33.630 --> 13:35.523
Lunch for two?
Yeah.

13:43.544 --> 13:46.509
So first of all,
do you know who I am?

13:46.634 --> 13:48.177
Uh, no, not really.

13:48.302 --> 13:51.407
I mean, your name is Ellie
and you're a producer or...

13:51.532 --> 13:54.550
I'm a vice president at
Paramount Pictures.

13:54.675 --> 13:56.151
Oh.
Yeah.

13:56.276 --> 13:58.019
I have a discretionary budget
and I can green-light.

13:58.144 --> 13:59.679
Do you know what that means?

14:01.549 --> 14:02.792
Yes, I...

14:02.917 --> 14:05.051
Are you interested in making movies?

14:06.621 --> 14:08.356
Yes.
Yes?

14:09.858 --> 14:11.635
Uh, yes, I... I am.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.870
Okay.

14:12.995 --> 14:15.444
Let's get started.

14:15.569 --> 14:16.569
Okay.

14:16.694 --> 14:19.845
Listen, I am a person...

14:19.970 --> 14:22.847
who knows when someone can do things.

14:22.972 --> 14:25.350
I know talent when I see it

14:25.475 --> 14:28.287
and I need you to know
that when I find someone,

14:28.412 --> 14:30.289
I don't mess around.

14:30.414 --> 14:33.459
Louie...
are you ready?

14:33.584 --> 14:35.228
Because after today,

14:35.353 --> 14:37.087
nothing is going to ever
be the same again.

14:42.827 --> 14:46.305
I bet you've got 50 movie ideas
sitting in that brain.

14:46.430 --> 14:47.773
Yeah, I have ideas.

14:47.898 --> 14:49.842
Let's make all of them.

14:49.967 --> 14:51.043
Okay.

14:51.168 --> 14:54.180
Tell me the best one now.

14:54.305 --> 14:56.115
Yeah?

14:56.240 --> 14:58.350
All right, well...

14:58.475 --> 15:00.419
well, you know how movies,
there's always a guy

15:00.544 --> 15:02.921
and his life is, you know, okay?

15:03.046 --> 15:04.657
And then something happens,

15:04.782 --> 15:07.660
like a conflict
and he has to resolve it,

15:07.785 --> 15:09.462
and then his life gets better?

15:09.587 --> 15:11.430
Well, I always wanted to make a movie

15:11.555 --> 15:13.933
where a guy's life is really bad

15:14.058 --> 15:16.535
and then something
happens and it makes it worse

15:16.660 --> 15:20.139
but instead of resolving it,
he just makes bad choices

15:20.264 --> 15:23.542
and then it goes
from worse to really bad,

15:23.667 --> 15:25.478
and... and things just keep
happening to him

15:25.603 --> 15:27.380
and he keeps doing dumb things,

15:27.505 --> 15:29.348
so his life just gets worse and worse

15:29.473 --> 15:31.050
and, like, darker and...

15:31.175 --> 15:34.387
Like... like he has... lives in
a little one-room apartment,

15:34.512 --> 15:36.856
he's not a very good-looking guy,

15:36.981 --> 15:39.560
he has no friends and he lives...

15:39.685 --> 15:42.062
he works in, like,
a factory, where they...

15:42.187 --> 15:45.466
like a sewage-disposal plant,

15:45.591 --> 15:47.134
and then he gets fired,

15:47.259 --> 15:50.204
so now he doesn't even have his
job at the shit factory anymore

15:50.329 --> 15:51.806
and he's... and he's going broke

15:51.931 --> 15:54.543
and he takes, like,
a trip and it rains,

15:54.668 --> 15:57.880
like, just stuff, just shit
keeps... horrible.

15:58.005 --> 15:59.415
But then he meets a girl

15:59.540 --> 16:01.351
and she's beautiful
and he falls in love,

16:01.476 --> 16:03.720
so you think that's gonna be
the thing, the happy thing,

16:03.845 --> 16:07.123
but then she turns out to
be a crook and she robs him,

16:07.248 --> 16:08.825
she takes his wallet,

16:08.950 --> 16:10.661
and now he's, like, stuck
in the middle of nowhere

16:10.786 --> 16:12.496
and he's got no wallet
and no credit cards.

16:12.621 --> 16:13.697
Like what do you do?

16:13.822 --> 16:15.266
How do you even get home or...

16:15.391 --> 16:17.835
Doesn't he have a cell phone?

16:17.960 --> 16:20.070
Well...

16:20.195 --> 16:21.271
Yeah, I mean,
I came up with this before

16:21.396 --> 16:23.040
cell phones were really...

16:23.165 --> 16:25.442
You know what,
Louie, this is amazing.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.477
I just... I just need to go
say hello to some people

16:27.602 --> 16:29.679
who just walked in.

16:29.804 --> 16:31.280
Give me a second, okay, hon?

16:31.405 --> 16:32.615
Okay.

16:32.740 --> 16:33.773
Oh.

16:54.593 --> 16:56.505
When I was... when
I graduated high school,

16:56.630 --> 16:59.808
all my friends went to college
and I didn't.

16:59.933 --> 17:01.744
I was a very bad
student and there was...

17:01.869 --> 17:03.145
No, I could have got into
some college,

17:03.270 --> 17:06.115
but why keep failing?

17:06.240 --> 17:08.484
Why just keep being in trouble
all the time

17:08.609 --> 17:09.953
and doing things badly?

17:10.078 --> 17:12.321
So I just figured, I'll just go
work and do things.

17:12.446 --> 17:15.625
So... I moved in with my only friend,

17:15.750 --> 17:17.126
who I wasn't very good friends with,

17:17.251 --> 17:18.627
but he also didn't go to college,

17:18.752 --> 17:20.997
so we got an apartment in Boston,

17:21.122 --> 17:23.099
and so we're both 18 years old

17:23.224 --> 17:24.834
living in downtown Boston

17:24.959 --> 17:28.604
and we lived in one room,
we slept in the same room,

17:28.729 --> 17:30.273
this little tiny studio apartment,

17:30.398 --> 17:33.810
and so one time, he started
making jokes about jerking off.

17:33.935 --> 17:35.846
He's like, "Do you
jerk off a lot, y'know?

17:35.971 --> 17:37.748
Do you want me to leave the room
so you can jerk off?"

17:37.873 --> 17:39.450
Like, he kept saying that.

17:39.575 --> 17:42.487
"Hey, man, if you need me to
leave so you can jerk off,

17:42.612 --> 17:44.122
I'll do that," or whatever.

17:44.247 --> 17:47.159
And I was like, "Well, hey, what
about when you would jerk off?"

17:47.284 --> 17:49.328
And he goes,
"I don't... I don't do that."

17:49.453 --> 17:50.663
And I was like, "What?"

17:50.788 --> 17:52.753
And he goes, "I never have done it."

17:52.878 --> 17:53.878
And I was like, "Are you serious?"

17:54.003 --> 17:55.368
I was blown away by this.

17:55.493 --> 17:56.603
He said, "I've never done it."

17:56.728 --> 17:57.971
He's goes, "I kinda wish I could,

17:58.096 --> 18:00.306
"but I just can't
bring myself to do it.

18:00.431 --> 18:01.908
"It's just too weird, like,
I get weirded out.

18:02.033 --> 18:03.676
I've never done it."

18:03.801 --> 18:04.944
And I was like, "Really?"

18:05.069 --> 18:06.145
And he said,
"Yeah, I never jerked off."

18:06.270 --> 18:08.348
And he told me that, and I...

18:08.473 --> 18:10.483
That stuck in me for years

18:10.608 --> 18:13.453
because I thought, there's
folks that cannot do it,

18:13.578 --> 18:15.788
because, to me,
this shit is just a plague.

18:15.913 --> 18:18.390
I'll never escape this shit.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.492
There's moments I've done this

18:20.617 --> 18:22.894
that I really
would like to take back,

18:23.019 --> 18:24.396
but I had... it's just, you know...

18:24.521 --> 18:26.798
Sometimes, I'm all packed,
ready, I got bags...

18:26.923 --> 18:28.699
And I go, "Uh, I gotta
sit down and jerk off

18:28.824 --> 18:30.067
before I leave the house."

18:30.192 --> 18:33.870
There's... it's just a constant...

18:33.995 --> 18:36.639
insulin injection that I need to get.

18:36.764 --> 18:37.941
And I really hate it.

18:38.066 --> 18:41.044
I'd love to never have to
jerk off, and this...

18:41.169 --> 18:44.415
And I've always thought, I'm...
there's something wrong with me,

18:44.540 --> 18:47.952
'cause there is a dude
who was pretty normal

18:48.077 --> 18:50.989
who just said, "I don't do it."

18:51.114 --> 18:53.091
Anyway, I ran into him
about two years ago,

18:53.216 --> 18:54.593
and he said to me,

18:54.718 --> 18:56.495
"Remember when I... when we
talked about jerking off?"

18:56.620 --> 18:58.564
And I said, "Yes!"

18:58.689 --> 19:01.200
And... he said,

19:01.325 --> 19:02.968
"I don't know why
I was, like, ashamed to

19:03.093 --> 19:06.405
talk about it with you, but I
was jerking off constantly."

19:06.530 --> 19:09.341
He said, "I've been jerking off
since I was 11

19:09.466 --> 19:10.943
"and when we lived together,

19:11.068 --> 19:12.611
"I used to go in the bathroom
and jack off all the time

19:12.736 --> 19:15.147
and I was afraid to tell you."

19:15.272 --> 19:16.782
And I was like, if I could...

19:16.907 --> 19:19.985
if I could murder one person,
it would be you.

19:20.110 --> 19:21.486
If I could kill one guy,

19:21.611 --> 19:23.315
it would be you, you piece of shit!

19:28.381 --> 19:32.499
When I was about
six years old, maybe,

19:32.624 --> 19:34.195
I stayed home from school one day.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.831
I had a single mom and she worked,

19:36.956 --> 19:38.099
so when I stayed home from school,

19:38.224 --> 19:40.101
I just got to be alone in my house,

19:40.226 --> 19:42.236
and so one day I was
alone in my house watching TV...

19:42.361 --> 19:44.838
I think I was about six years
old, maybe seven,

19:44.963 --> 19:48.575
and I went and got my pillow
from my bed and I sat on it

19:48.700 --> 19:52.078
and I farted into it,
and then I decided...

19:52.203 --> 19:53.546
I was sick in my stomach,

19:53.671 --> 19:56.115
so I was like, I'm just gonna
fart into this pillow

19:56.240 --> 19:57.750
for as... just all day.

19:57.875 --> 20:00.853
I mean, I just kt
farting into that pillow,

20:00.978 --> 20:02.789
just over and over again,

20:02.914 --> 20:06.760
like, at least more than 200 times,

20:06.885 --> 20:09.596
just for hours,

20:09.721 --> 20:13.100
and then I told myself,
I'm gonna smell this now

20:13.225 --> 20:16.571
because I've been farting into
it all day.

20:16.696 --> 20:18.773
And I just... I had
the pillow and I just said,

20:18.898 --> 20:21.041
I'm just gonna go all at once

20:21.166 --> 20:22.700
and I just shoved it in my face
and I went...

20:24.303 --> 20:26.513
And...

20:26.638 --> 20:29.115
I have never had an experience

20:29.240 --> 20:30.783
like that again in my life.

20:30.908 --> 20:33.752
I really feel like
I overstimulated myself

20:33.877 --> 20:37.322
at six years old because it,
like, jaded me for

20:37.447 --> 20:39.415
every other thing
that's ever happened.

20:41.752 --> 20:45.365
I watched a bum eat a rat

20:45.490 --> 20:47.700
and I was like, "So...

20:47.825 --> 20:50.369
I smelled 200 farts when I was six."
