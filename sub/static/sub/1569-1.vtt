WEBVTT

00:02.960 --> 00:04.121
<i>This thing's moving too fast,</i>

00:04.200 --> 00:05.689
<i>and it's heading for New York.</i>

00:05.760 --> 00:07.967
<i>Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.</i>

00:09.080 --> 00:11.287
There's not gonna be
a safe landing,

00:11.600 --> 00:13.125
<i>but I can try
and force it down.</i>

00:13.640 --> 00:14.846
<i>I'll get Howard on the line.</i>

00:14.920 --> 00:16.445
<i>He'll know what to do.</i>

00:16.520 --> 00:18.249
I got to put her in the water.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.567
Please, don't do this.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.449
We have time. We can work it out.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.446
Peggy.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.284
<i>This is my choice.</i>

01:05.640 --> 01:07.483
I thought we could stop off
in Lucerne

01:07.560 --> 01:09.050
for a late-night fondue.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.331
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.331
<i>We're lucky to have him.</i>

01:41.240 --> 01:42.605
- Don't bother.
- Colleen.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.489
I can't feel my feet.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.722
They let 10 girls go yesterday.

01:48.520 --> 01:49.965
Did they say why?

01:50.040 --> 01:52.247
Because 10 more GIs
got discharged.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.009
I had to show a guy from
Canarsie how to use a rivet gun.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.004
Oh. I think I have tuberculosis.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.127
Thanks, by the way.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.964
You loaned this to me last night
while you were at work.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.769
It looks better on you.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.521
Kind of thing might really
catch a man's eye...

02:06.000 --> 02:07.604
Say, on a date?

02:07.760 --> 02:10.842
Well, don't hold your breath,
especially with tuberculosis.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.366
You know,
there's a difference between

02:13.440 --> 02:15.568
being an independent woman
and a spinster.

02:15.640 --> 02:16.971
Is it the shoes?

02:18.120 --> 02:21.010
Clock out, pull the curtains,
and sleep. Peggy's orders.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.206
'Kay.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.251
If I don't see you, remember,

02:24.320 --> 02:25.810
we're going to the movies
on Saturday.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.008
- I have the night off.
- I'll try.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.209
You know how busy
the office keeps me.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.681
Peg, you work
at the phone company.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.081
It ain't life and death.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.121
Darling, you have no idea.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.361
Good morning, Rose.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.761
Lot of hubbub today, Peg.
DC line's hot.

03:16.720 --> 03:17.801
Love the hat.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.605
Who was the asset on that?

03:29.680 --> 03:30.886
The asset was...

03:46.840 --> 03:49.320
Agent Carter, we just caught
a redball out of DC.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.811
All hands on deck.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.084
Meaning cover the phones.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.448
Rose, forward all calls
to the briefing room.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.650
Covered. Shall we?

04:05.840 --> 04:07.251
<i>Americans have long followed</i>

04:07.320 --> 04:09.243
<i>the career
of inventor Howard Stark,</i>

04:09.320 --> 04:11.607
<i>from boy genius
to weapons developer</i>

04:11.680 --> 04:13.091
<i>to multimillionaire.</i>

04:13.320 --> 04:15.322
<i>Even more have followed
his private life.</i>

04:16.040 --> 04:17.451
<i>But his most recent exploits</i>

04:17.519 --> 04:20.171
<i>threaten to send this flyboy
into a nosedive.</i>

04:20.600 --> 04:22.364
<i>Accused of selling weapons
to the enemy,</i>

04:22.680 --> 04:23.920
<i>the founder of Stark Industries</i>

04:24.000 --> 04:26.446
<i>was recently called
to Capitol Hill.</i>

04:26.920 --> 04:28.206
<i>May I ask a question?</i>

04:28.280 --> 04:29.770
<i>Not until
you answer the question</i>

04:29.840 --> 04:31.365
<i>already before
this committee.</i>

04:31.440 --> 04:33.841
<i>It's been so long, I don't even
remember what it was.</i>

04:34.280 --> 04:37.648
<i>Did you knowingly sell
military-grade technology</i>

04:37.800 --> 04:40.121
<i>to enemies
of the United States?</i>

04:40.200 --> 04:41.247
<i>Not knowingly.</i>

04:41.320 --> 04:42.970
<i>Did you do it
unknowingly?</i>

04:43.640 --> 04:46.291
<i>Now, by definition, that would
be impossible to answer.</i>

04:55.520 --> 04:58.410
So far,
six pieces of Stark's technology

04:58.480 --> 05:00.084
have turned up
either on the black market

05:00.440 --> 05:02.363
or in the arsenals
of enemy states.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.249
He's been waffling
on the hill,

05:04.320 --> 05:05.606
treating the whole thing
like a joke.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.642
Yesterday was
the final day of hearings.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.166
Stark didn't show.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.924
They checked
his half a dozen houses

05:12.040 --> 05:14.247
and his half a dozen offices.
Nothing.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.324
So, as of this moment,

05:16.400 --> 05:18.323
Howard Stark is not only
in contempt of Congress,

05:18.400 --> 05:20.129
he's a fugitive from justice.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.163
Find him. Squeeze him till he
loses his sense of humor.

05:24.800 --> 05:25.881
Thompson.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.571
You're lead.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.481
I'll ground his planes,
freeze his bank accounts.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.489
There's a girl at First Federal
who wants to owe me a favor.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.647
Sir, I really must object.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.841
Why am I not surprised?

05:35.040 --> 05:36.929
I knew Howard Stark
during the war.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.286
His help was invaluable.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.402
He may be a great many things,
but he's not a traitor.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.609
We're all aware of your record, Agent.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.366
I'm sure being Captain America's...

05:45.920 --> 05:47.001
Liaison...

05:47.760 --> 05:50.127
Brought you into contact with
all sorts of interesting people.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.927
But the war's over.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.921
Let the professionals decide
who's worth going after.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.163
Sounds like Carter knew
a lot of guys during the war.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.571
What'd you say, Krzeminski?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.046
I wasn't talking to you.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.770
You owe the lady an apology.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.726
Oh. You standing up
for her now, Sousa?

06:08.320 --> 06:09.685
Better hurry. I don't have all day.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.921
Huh? No?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.126
Okay.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.487
Agent Sousa,
about what you just did...

06:24.760 --> 06:25.761
Ah, don't worry about it...

06:25.840 --> 06:26.966
I wish you hadn't.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.284
You're an agent.
They treat you like a secretary.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.805
- I just wanted...
- And I'm grateful.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.406
I'm also more than capable
of handling

06:33.480 --> 06:35.164
whatever these adolescents
throw at me.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.691
Yes, ma'am.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.481
Doesn't mean I have to like it, though.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.888
Well, that's another thing
we have in common.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.481
Carter?

06:44.160 --> 06:45.924
Gonna be a little busy
with your friend, Stark.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.240
If you don't mind,
these surveillance reports

06:47.320 --> 06:49.004
need to be filed, and...

06:49.480 --> 06:50.970
You're really so much better
at that kind of thing.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.407
What kind of thing is that,
Agent Thompson? The alphabet?

06:53.960 --> 06:55.166
I can teach you.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.448
Let's start with words
beginning with "A."

06:59.560 --> 07:00.607
Thanks, kid.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.411
<i>Adios. Auf wiedersehen. Aloha.</i>

07:03.760 --> 07:05.000
Poor guy.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.806
Heard he got his personality
shot off in Iwo Jima.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.851
I saw him once
at a USO show in Passaic.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.722
You can eat him with a spoon.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.611
Yes, I understand
he was quite something.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.648
- Order up!

07:30.040 --> 07:31.280
Everything all right, English?

07:31.360 --> 07:33.727
Fine, Angie,
if you don't count work.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.729
Boys at the phone company
giving you a hard time?

07:35.800 --> 07:37.802
No more than usual.
It's just...

07:38.360 --> 07:42.046
During the war, I had a sense
of purpose, responsibility.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.960
But now I connect the calls,

07:45.040 --> 07:46.246
but I never get a chance
to make them.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.407
Do you know what I mean?

07:50.160 --> 07:51.969
I had an audition today, uptown.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.246
Took three trains,

07:53.320 --> 07:55.926
got two bars into
<i>Is You Is Or Is You Ain't...</i>

07:56.000 --> 07:57.684
They gave me the hook.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.491
I guess I ain't.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.848
We all got to pay our dues,
even if it takes a while.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.605
You got talent.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.728
It's just a matter of time
before Broadway calls.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.365
I'm afraid I can't carry a tune.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.249
Doesn't matter
when you got legs like yours.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.970
This is supposed
to be a BLT?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.166
Where's the girl?

08:13.840 --> 08:16.241
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you not work here anymore?

08:17.160 --> 08:18.650
Looks like I got to go.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.721
Is he a regular?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.404
Yeah, but a regular what,

08:21.520 --> 08:23.568
I'm not allowed to say that
on the clock.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.566
See ya later.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.089
Miss Carter?

08:54.240 --> 08:55.446
Do I know you?

08:56.440 --> 08:58.647
Oh, we haven't had
the pleasure.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.964
But we may yet.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.041
You're coming with me.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.681
I know.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.410
I should've called first.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.730
Did you miss me?

09:33.080 --> 09:34.650
They're calling you a traitor.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.489
I'm calling it a setup.

09:37.720 --> 09:38.846
I have a vault.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.446
"Had," I should say.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.285
Sub-basement of my office.
Triple-thick, lead-lined.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.647
It was where
I kept my bad babies.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.047
Bad babies?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.682
Inventions too dangerous for anyone...

09:50.040 --> 09:51.087
Even my friends.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.003
Which begs the question,
why invent them at all?

09:53.080 --> 09:54.525
I can't help what I think of,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.841
but I can damn well control
what I sell.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.169
At least, I could until last month.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.526
What happened last month?

10:00.880 --> 10:02.564
I was in Monaco...

10:02.640 --> 10:04.722
With a lovely tax advisor.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.890
When I got back, I found a hole under
my vault, all the way to the sewer.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.769
Somebody cleaned me out.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.126
A couple of weeks later,
my bad babies,

10:11.200 --> 10:13.282
they start turning up
on the black market.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.441
But why run?

10:14.520 --> 10:16.363
Why not tell the Senate the truth,
ask for their help?

10:16.440 --> 10:17.851
Apparently, it's not too big a jump

10:17.920 --> 10:19.968
to see me
cutting a hole in my own vault

10:20.040 --> 10:21.724
and making some money
on the sly.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.761
Really?

10:25.720 --> 10:27.722
I'm just considering all the angles.

10:27.800 --> 10:28.881
Seems you have a lot of them.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.010
Now, that's the Peggy Carter I need.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.969
- For what?
- To clear my name.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.007
You can't be serious.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.411
I try not to be,

10:36.720 --> 10:38.882
but sometimes it just slips out anyway.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.041
Oh, come on, Peg.
You know darn well I didn't do this,

10:42.160 --> 10:44.322
which means the SSR
is looking for the wrong guy.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.891
I want to find the right guy.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.164
But I'm gonna need someone
on the inside, someone I can trust.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.962
And, Peg, there's no one I trust
more than you.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.487
Howard, you're asking me
to become a traitor

10:55.560 --> 10:57.005
in order to prove you are not one.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.923
- You do see the irony?
- Come on, Peg.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.723
I know they're not
using you right over there.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.011
You want a mission that matters?
This is it.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.003
My technology in the hands of some nut

11:07.080 --> 11:09.208
that wants to be the next Red Skull...

11:09.520 --> 11:11.761
You have no idea
how bad that could be.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.683
Right now, you're the only one
that can stop that.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.610
Here's good.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.401
Kill the lights.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.684
Where are you headed?

11:31.760 --> 11:34.650
Some of my babies
have already sold overseas.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.121
I'm gonna pay them a visit.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.010
The rest of them are here somewhere,
which is where you come in.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.128
Word is, one of the nasty ones

11:42.200 --> 11:44.123
is hitting the market
in the next day or two.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.361
What is it?

11:45.440 --> 11:46.965
Just a piece of paper...

11:47.360 --> 11:50.204
My formula for molecular nitramene.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.691
Technically, we're not
even sure it works,

11:51.760 --> 11:55.128
but, well, let's face it.
I invented it, so it works.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.050
If that stuff were ever fabricated...

11:58.120 --> 11:59.326
Boom?

11:59.880 --> 12:03.089
This much would level a city block.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.044
And I'm not talking
the short ones. Avenues.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.324
I'm going to regret this, aren't I?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.765
Absolutely.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.531
But when you're not humiliating him,

12:11.600 --> 12:14.763
that fellow up there
is my butler, Edwin Jarvis.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.725
He'll help you in any way he can.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.010
I owe you one, pal.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.246
There are only a dozen fences

12:26.320 --> 12:28.243
that can handle something
this hot.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.801
You just got to learn which one.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.971
And I figured you'd never
have any trouble finding a man.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.122
The trick is finding the right one.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.330
Nice to see you, too, Howard.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.250
The next time you approach
a woman in a dark alley,

12:57.320 --> 12:59.129
you might introduce yourself.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.642
Well, I shall endeavor
to remember that,

13:01.720 --> 13:04.451
provided my concussion
isn't too severe.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.091
Should you need me.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.051
Call any time before 9:00.

13:10.560 --> 13:11.846
What happens at 9:00?

13:12.280 --> 13:13.884
My wife and I go to bed.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.686
7:00, sherry.
8:00, Benny Goodman. 9:00, bed.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.569
You're new to espionage,
aren't you?

13:18.800 --> 13:20.086
Far from it.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.562
Last summer, I caught the cook
pocketing the good spoons.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.245
What now, Miss Carter?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.207
Now I go to work.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.281
You know, you are expected
to go home at night.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.601
Most fugitive cases are solved
in the first 72 hours.

13:56.720 --> 14:01.044
If Stark's sailing into the sunset,
maybe this is where he starts.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.888
He must have really liked that girl.

14:04.960 --> 14:05.961
Hmm?

14:06.040 --> 14:08.088
Because there's no other reason
why he'd get in a boat.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.846
I'm sorry, Daniel,
but Stark hates water.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.081
He can't even swim.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.527
Really? How do you...

14:13.600 --> 14:15.921
He tried to kiss me on V-E day.
I knocked him into the Thames.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.690
We had to get frogmen
to fish him out.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.887
...classified information...

14:21.960 --> 14:23.200
Something's up.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.487
Thompson's working on his next medal.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.641
Got word of a fence

14:26.760 --> 14:28.683
trying to sell
one of Stark's inventions...

14:28.760 --> 14:30.444
Club owner
named Spider Raymond.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.721
Where's it happening?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.450
Need-to-know only.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.764
Kind of gives you
a warm feeling, doesn't it?

14:35.840 --> 14:37.922
- Get you a refill?
- Actually, I'm still...

14:38.240 --> 14:39.241
Drinking that.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.483
Post eyes at the exits and at
the newsstand across the street.

14:42.680 --> 14:43.886
Dress sharp...

14:43.960 --> 14:45.928
Handkerchiefs, spit shine.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.411
It'll be a rich crowd.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.720
Do your best.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.882
I'll call O'Dwyer,
get you some uniformed backup.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.644
Too showy.
Raymond's paranoid.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.643
Only things he lets slide
are blondes and money.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.009
If we want to grab Raymond
and his buyer

14:57.080 --> 14:59.208
with whatever it is
that Stark is selling,

14:59.760 --> 15:01.410
then I go in light and fast.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.084
We want everyone
feeling real comfortable.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.491
Two men, side arms only.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.330
That how you did it in Okinawa?

15:06.400 --> 15:08.448
Sometimes.
Other times, we brought a tank.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.161
Figured we'd save that for later.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.688
Okay, Thompson, this is your play.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.805
Grinding beans over there, Carter?

15:16.360 --> 15:18.010
This is field agents only.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.807
It's okay, Chief. Let her stay.
Maybe she'll learn something.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.327
Thank you, Agent.
I already have.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.165
What do you really want?

15:26.520 --> 15:29.046
I wonder if I might request a sick day.

15:29.640 --> 15:30.926
What's the matter?
Got a headache?

15:31.760 --> 15:32.966
Amongst other things.

15:34.680 --> 15:35.841
Ladies' things.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.886
Oh, geez.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.600
Yeah, sure, take the day.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.967
Go shopping,
whatever makes you feel better.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.166
Thank you for your understanding.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.526
Enjoy your coffee.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.168
You got any issues
need taking care of?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.766
If this stuff does
what you say it can, Brannis,

16:14.840 --> 16:16.444
you're gonna be very rich.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.567
And I'm guessing
a fair amount of people

16:17.640 --> 16:19.165
are gonna be very dead.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.443
You know, we could, uh,
do some serious business

16:21.520 --> 16:22.851
if you'd just tell me
what else you got

16:22.960 --> 16:24.485
out of
Howard Stark's basement.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.046
What've you got?

16:26.360 --> 16:28.249
A-bombs? Ray guns?

16:28.440 --> 16:29.805
Jane Russell's number?

16:32.840 --> 16:34.046
Well, whatever it is,

16:34.120 --> 16:36.566
if you need to liquidate,
my door's open.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.205
Nice talking to you.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.887
You look like a lady
looking to dance.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.770
I'm afraid
I'd only step on your toes.

17:15.839 --> 17:17.490
Another time, perhaps.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.490
Oh, no,
we're supposed to be upstairs.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.890
I'm looking for Mr. Raymond.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.849
I have something I'd like to sell.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.090
First door on the right.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.161
Thanks, sugar.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.924
Mr. Raymond, is this a bad time?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.004
We'll only know after it's over.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.004
Bring the rest of you in here.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.450
I hope you don't find me forward.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.843
Well, I'm not
the judgmental type.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.884
Um...

18:19.200 --> 18:20.884
I know you are in, um...

18:22.200 --> 18:24.885
...possession of
a certain chemical formula.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.610
I got a lot of club to run,
miss, so if you'd just...

18:26.680 --> 18:28.921
It's okay.
Let's make this a game.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.328
You seem like
you might like games.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.723
You don't have to
tell me anything.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.208
You just have to, um...

18:37.520 --> 18:38.965
Look right here.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.283
Now, I don't care where you got it,
but cards on the table...

18:43.360 --> 18:46.364
You are the proud owner
of a certain chemical formula.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.320
Just a little
piece of paper, right?

18:51.080 --> 18:54.687
I have some friends
who would be very interested

18:54.760 --> 18:56.728
in buying that formula.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.128
Now, I know I said, "Spider Raymond,

18:59.240 --> 19:01.322
"he doesn't hold on
to anything for long.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.890
"He must already have a buyer."

19:03.160 --> 19:06.642
But, you see, the thing is,
I think I can...

19:07.080 --> 19:08.605
Offer you more.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.651
Is it here?

19:11.160 --> 19:12.730
Do you want me
to search you?

19:13.200 --> 19:14.929
Sweetheart, I don't have it on me.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.562
Hey, boss, there's a guy
downstairs that's...

19:23.040 --> 19:25.042
I guess
I'll just have him wait.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.289
Well, that was a bit premature.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.610
Crikey O'Reilly.

20:09.960 --> 20:10.961
Jarvis residence.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.042
- They've weaponized it.
- Miss Carter?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.851
Do you know anyone else handling
high explosives at this time of night?

20:15.920 --> 20:17.126
Oh, as a matter of fact, no.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.089
It's just that
I promised my wife a soufflé.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.003
And if I don't get it
in the oven by...

20:21.080 --> 20:23.401
Mr. Jarvis, what was once
a theory is now a bomb,

20:23.480 --> 20:24.686
so apologies to your wife,

20:24.760 --> 20:26.250
<i>but dinner
will have to wait.</i>

20:26.320 --> 20:27.481
No, you're quite right.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.403
Mr. Stark left a note.
Hold the line.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.247
Is the nitramene,
by any chance, glowing?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.401
Yes.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.686
<i>Oh, that's not ideal.</i>

20:40.800 --> 20:42.131
"An orange glow
would indicate

20:42.200 --> 20:44.328
"the nitramene
has reached peak volatility

20:44.400 --> 20:46.368
"and should be handled
with caution.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.649
<i>"Cracking its shell
would result in an implosion</i>

20:48.720 --> 20:49.881
"with a blast radius of..."

20:49.960 --> 20:52.201
Oh. 500 yards.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.686
Delightful.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.081
"Render it inert
with a solution

20:55.160 --> 20:57.128
"of sodium hydrogen carbonate
and acetate."

20:57.200 --> 20:59.601
Where you're going to find that
at this time of night, I have no idea.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.603
- Leave that to me.
<i>- There's one last note here.</i>

21:01.680 --> 21:04.604
"Avoid touching the core
to the containment ring.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.081
<i>"Touching the core
will result in..."</i>

21:07.200 --> 21:08.201
Death?

21:08.280 --> 21:10.851
I was going to say
"core overload,"

21:10.920 --> 21:12.046
<i>but yes.</i>

21:12.120 --> 21:14.122
<i>- Edwin, I'm home!</i>

21:14.200 --> 21:16.168
Uh, I won't be a moment, Anna!

21:16.240 --> 21:17.446
<i>If that will be all?</i>

21:17.520 --> 21:18.760
Mr. Jarvis, you do realize

21:18.880 --> 21:21.451
that this job will have certain
after-hours requirements?

21:21.520 --> 21:22.885
So does my wife,
Miss Carter.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.007
Good night.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.121
You boys got a warrant,

21:37.200 --> 21:39.362
or are you just here
to socialize?

21:40.200 --> 21:41.326
Both.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.482
You don't mind if we take
a look around, do you?

22:05.600 --> 22:06.761
Boss?

22:28.760 --> 22:29.966
You don't say.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.284
Fancy a dance?

22:34.160 --> 22:36.049
I'm so glad
you changed your mind.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.168
What can I say?
It's every woman's right.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.721
Oh, no.
No, no, no!

22:54.960 --> 22:56.564
Hey, now.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.846
Listen, friend,
I know we had a deal,

22:57.920 --> 22:59.490
but the blonde
must've taken it.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.287
I can fix this.

23:09.360 --> 23:10.805
- Dip me.
- What?

23:15.480 --> 23:17.801
Thanks, doll. We should
try it again sometime.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.240
Maybe we shouldn't have
spent all that time

23:26.320 --> 23:27.845
changing our clothes.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.730
Seal the damn exits.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.685
Peg? Is that you?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.923
Oh, hey.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.089
They sent me home, fever.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.531
I didn't know
what time you'd be back.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.204
I can take the chair.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.050
No, don't even think about it.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.765
I'll make you some tea.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.041
Wow.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.487
Peg, you look like
a million bucks.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.651
Wait.
Were you out, out?

24:09.360 --> 24:10.691
In a manner of speaking.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.804
Oh, Peg, I'm...
I'm really proud of you.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.123
I knew you were too great a catch
to be alone for too long.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.289
I want you
to tell me all about it...

24:19.360 --> 24:20.566
In the morning.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.930
- Colleen?

25:23.560 --> 25:25.050
Is everything all right?

25:30.240 --> 25:31.207
Colleen?

26:59.360 --> 27:01.044
<i>I'm sorry to appear callous,</i>

27:01.760 --> 27:04.081
but is there any way
it can be traced back to you?

27:04.680 --> 27:06.250
My name wasn't on the lease.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.125
No one knew me except...

27:08.200 --> 27:09.770
Did she have any family?

27:11.120 --> 27:13.248
She lost a brother at Guadalcanal.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.767
I'd only known her a few months.

27:17.720 --> 27:18.960
I needed a place to stay.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.724
I didn't know anyone in...

27:23.600 --> 27:26.729
I seem to have a habit
of losing people closest to me.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.411
Perhaps "losing" is too nice a word.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.611
I get them killed.

27:33.760 --> 27:34.841
Miss Carter.

27:34.920 --> 27:38.527
When Howard came to me,
I was damn happy to see him.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.241
I'd been wallowing in it
since the war,

27:42.760 --> 27:46.048
wondering why no one would give
Agent Peggy Carter a shot.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.649
So I grabbed the chance.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.924
But I mucked it up.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.284
And now Colleen is dead...

27:56.080 --> 27:57.605
Because of me.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.763
Miss Carter,
I've read your war record.

28:08.040 --> 28:11.328
You are a credit
to your profession.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.645
If the men in your office
can't see that,

28:13.720 --> 28:14.881
then they're fools.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.808
You were trying
to do something good,

28:17.880 --> 28:20.121
and I believe
you accomplished it.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.367
But was it worth it?

28:24.280 --> 28:27.363
I don't think we'll know that
until the job is truly done.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.928
Where does your wife
think you are right now?

28:33.680 --> 28:36.081
One of Mr. Stark's
more amorous admirers

28:36.160 --> 28:38.447
has refused
to vacate his penthouse.

28:39.080 --> 28:43.085
I am presently
supervising her extraction.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.284
I imagine that's quite believable.

28:47.320 --> 28:49.243
You have no idea.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.002
We need to know
where this came from.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.889
But I can't exactly walk it
into the SSR headquarters.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.128
I may know a gentleman.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.171
<i>Dr. Vanko,
what do we have here?</i>

29:08.480 --> 29:10.403
A lanthanum carbon alloy.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.926
Rather clever.
I might add, rather unstable.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.241
So it couldn't have come
from very far away.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.606
Well, before the war,

29:16.680 --> 29:19.251
there were only three refineries
capable of something like this.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.567
The Navy
tore down Franklin Chemical,

29:21.640 --> 29:23.051
and Eaglestar
converted to diesel,

29:23.120 --> 29:24.121
so that only leaves...

29:24.240 --> 29:25.366
Roxxon.
Right.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.290
This has to be 200 acres.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.328
It would take weeks
to search.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.290
Dr. Vanko, please tell me
that isn't still, um...

29:33.040 --> 29:34.087
Volatile.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.446
Oh, volatile...
No, no.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.965
Active?

29:37.040 --> 29:38.121
Oh, yes.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.251
The nitramene still emits
low levels of vita-radiation.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.446
Vita-rays?

29:42.520 --> 29:44.807
Yeah, we occasionally use them
in our experiments to stabilize the...

29:44.880 --> 29:46.530
I know what they do.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.527
I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.921
A week next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

30:24.600 --> 30:25.761
You got it.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.606
<i>8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late.</i>

30:29.280 --> 30:31.009
Just be there.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.285
We'll have the band
play something slow.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.689
<i>I'd hate to step on your...</i>

30:37.760 --> 30:39.250
Steve?

30:41.760 --> 30:43.046
Steve...

30:55.760 --> 30:57.205
Sorry. I still haven't
quite got the hang of...

30:57.280 --> 30:58.611
It's fine.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.929
I can assure you,
I don't do this often.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.091
You know, after I got hit...

31:10.840 --> 31:13.161
At the field hospital,
the chaplain asked me

31:13.440 --> 31:15.647
was there anybody
I wanted to send my effects to,

31:15.720 --> 31:17.290
should, you know,
the worst happen.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.646
I told him I didn't think
my dad had much use

31:20.720 --> 31:23.121
for two pairs of green socks
and an old paperback.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.321
Let him remember my life,
you know?

31:28.600 --> 31:30.762
'Course, I didn't die,
which was inconvenient,

31:30.840 --> 31:33.810
because the chaplain had already
trashed my footlocker.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.685
Still missing half my stuff.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.090
Can't find my leg anywhere.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.521
Daniel.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.164
You're one of the lucky ones.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.002
Well-armed
for a mothballed facility,

33:30.080 --> 33:31.730
wouldn't you say?

33:32.600 --> 33:33.965
Keep your eyes open.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.280
But I'm coming with you.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.330
Mr. Jarvis, that cook with the spoons...

33:38.400 --> 33:40.323
Was she a large woman?
Violent?

33:40.400 --> 33:41.925
Well, no, she was
quite diminutive, actually,

33:42.040 --> 33:45.044
but she had a vicious tongue
and extremely long...

33:48.880 --> 33:50.120
...fingernails.

34:07.600 --> 34:08.647
Oh.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.847
Oh!

34:38.480 --> 34:40.130
Takes a minute to cool.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.690
I'm taking a pretty big risk
doing this.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.409
Least you could do
is smile.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.765
<i>Miss Carter,
it seems that...</i>

35:48.600 --> 35:49.647
That's far enough!

35:57.560 --> 35:58.561
I wouldn't.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.003
<i>You don't want to fire again.</i>

36:08.080 --> 36:09.320
Who are you?

36:09.400 --> 36:13.325
<i>I'm an independent businessman
just trying to make his mark.</i>

36:13.680 --> 36:15.011
By murdering people?

36:15.080 --> 36:16.969
<i>I don't murder people.</i>

36:17.160 --> 36:19.481
<i>I just sell
to people who do.</i>

36:20.000 --> 36:21.490
And what about your friend?

36:22.040 --> 36:23.530
Green suit?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.688
Scar on his throat
like yours?

36:27.160 --> 36:28.446
<i>He's not my friend.</i>

36:29.080 --> 36:31.208
Tell me his name,
or so help me God,

36:31.280 --> 36:33.123
I'll blow us both to hell.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.927
<i>He doesn't have a name anymore.</i>

36:36.000 --> 36:37.889
<i>And you can go ahead
and pull that trigger,</i>

36:37.960 --> 36:40.281
<i>'cause if he's here,
we're both dead anyway.</i>

36:42.360 --> 36:44.283
<i>Leviathan is coming.</i>

36:44.760 --> 36:45.886
Who?

36:45.960 --> 36:48.008
<i>They'll tell you themselves
soon enough.</i>

36:48.560 --> 36:50.801
<i>You're not gonna like the future...</i>

36:50.880 --> 36:52.370
<i>Such as it is.</i>

36:54.440 --> 36:55.930
<i>30 seconds, Agent.</i>

37:00.960 --> 37:03.122
Mr. Jarvis, do you think
you could bring the car around?

37:03.640 --> 37:05.085
Of course.
When would you like it?

37:05.200 --> 37:06.486
Oh, in about 20 seconds.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.884
- Stop him!

37:15.160 --> 37:16.525
<i>Meet me on the access road!</i>

37:16.600 --> 37:18.090
You know I'm being shot at!

37:18.160 --> 37:19.241
Now!

37:21.000 --> 37:23.048
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Stark!

37:29.320 --> 37:30.367
Where are you?

37:30.440 --> 37:31.771
Just keep driving!

37:31.840 --> 37:33.649
Could you be slightly more specific?

37:33.720 --> 37:34.721
No!

37:41.840 --> 37:44.161
- Miss Carter?
- Go! Go!

37:45.000 --> 37:46.047
Don't you want to get in?

37:52.720 --> 37:55.200
Drive faster!
We've only got 10 seconds!

37:56.400 --> 37:57.731
What happened back there?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.525
If we live,
I'll tell you all about it.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.248
- Faster!
- I am going faster!

38:35.640 --> 38:37.563
It would seem it works.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.844
<i>Flight manifests
turned up nothing.</i>

38:42.920 --> 38:45.048
We got a call in to London.
I know a guy there. He's...

38:45.120 --> 38:46.406
We were in the middle
of something here, Jack.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.687
That bouncer from
the broom closet finally came to.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.161
Says he caught a blonde with
Raymond's body around 9:30.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.401
Why didn't he stop her?

38:52.680 --> 38:54.489
'Cause they're still
pulling staples out of his face.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.401
Get that.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.001
Chief Dooley's office.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.411
So we're looking
for an angry blonde.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.527
Have you called my house?

39:03.680 --> 39:05.603
And that is where
my promotion comes in, Chief.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.049
I talked
to the club photographer.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.285
He thinks he got a shot of her.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.686
I'm thinking real hard about
kissing you right now, son.

39:14.760 --> 39:15.807
Yeah, I'll tell him.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.245
Double-time this
over to the lab, see if we can...

39:17.320 --> 39:19.766
Port authority says
Roxxon Refinery just blew up.

39:20.280 --> 39:21.520
The whole thing?

39:21.720 --> 39:22.960
Any casualties?

39:23.200 --> 39:24.964
Hard to say.
They can't find the building.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.368
Let's go.
You two, you're with me.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.565
<i>Perhaps some warm milk.</i>

39:37.640 --> 39:39.608
Something a little stronger
might be in order.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.002
You did very well, Mr. Jarvis.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.208
Your wife would be very proud.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.523
She must never, ever know.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.565
You'll get used to that.

39:51.560 --> 39:52.846
What word did he use?

39:53.880 --> 39:55.245
"Leviathan."

39:58.080 --> 39:59.923
I'll check Mr. Stark's files.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.566
Provided the SSR
hasn't taken them all.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.811
Get some rest.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.644
To be perfectly honest...

40:11.320 --> 40:13.687
I'm not sure
I'll sleep for days.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.001
- Order up!

40:23.120 --> 40:24.087
Hey, honey, you back there,

40:24.160 --> 40:25.605
or are you still
getting your beauty sleep?

40:25.680 --> 40:28.126
Yes, sir.
You're in early this morning.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.201
How can I help?

40:29.320 --> 40:30.321
You do know the difference

40:30.400 --> 40:31.925
between real eggs
and powdered ones, right?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.411
Believe it or not.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.369
I did three weeks
in a POW camp.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.363
The Nazis fed us better than this.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.402
Next time, don't get smart
with me, sweetheart.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.970
Your brains aren't your best feature.

40:51.160 --> 40:52.969
I understand
you're not happy with your meal.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.530
- You work here?
- Unfortunately, no.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.170
- Ohhh!
- Just so we're clear,

40:56.240 --> 40:58.049
this is pressed into your brachial artery.

40:58.120 --> 40:59.451
It may be dull, but I'm determined.

40:59.560 --> 41:00.641
Keep smiling.

41:00.720 --> 41:01.721
Once you start to bleed,

41:01.800 --> 41:03.131
you'll lose consciousness
in 15 seconds.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.931
You'll die in 90 unless
someone comes to your aid.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.161
Now, given your recent behavior,

41:07.240 --> 41:08.651
how likely do you think
that is to happen?

41:09.840 --> 41:11.569
To prevent this
not entirely unfortunate event

41:11.640 --> 41:14.246
from occurring, I'd suggest
you find a new place to eat.

41:14.320 --> 41:15.367
Do we understand each other?

41:15.440 --> 41:16.441
- Yeah.
- Good.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.887
Oh, one more thing. Tip generously.

41:35.880 --> 41:38.247
Swish the glass
with the vermouth,

41:38.320 --> 41:40.448
tip it out, then add the gin.

41:40.560 --> 41:41.686
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Stark,

41:41.760 --> 41:43.967
but I'm afraid
I can't be everywhere at once.

41:45.840 --> 41:47.330
Well, you're quite right.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.481
Miss Carter's an excellent choice.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.725
I don't think she'll have
any suspicions at all.
