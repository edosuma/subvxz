WEBVTT

00:10.700 --> 00:14.099
Staff meeting starting
in seven, six, five, four...

00:14.100 --> 00:17.800
- Before we start I just have to...
- Three, two, one.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.999
- And we're in it. Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.900
So I'd like to begin by
welcoming Jill Casey to her

00:22.901 --> 00:25.600
first ever official
Hankmed staff meeting.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.100
Applause please, right now.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.400
- Real applause.
- All right.

00:28.401 --> 00:31.000
Even though Jill may be
leaving the Hamptons sometime soon,

00:31.100 --> 00:32.600
in which case we'd all be very sad,

00:32.800 --> 00:36.399
uh, your clinic would be left in good hands
and your non-equity membership to Hankmed

00:36.400 --> 00:38.500
will be left in very good standing.
We love you, uh...

00:39.400 --> 00:40.399
Yeah!

00:40.400 --> 00:42.200
- Don't patronize us. Okay.
- Okay.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.999
First order of
business today is Divya, so...

00:45.000 --> 00:46.099
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:46.100 --> 00:49.400
Okay, I was just at Baker and the Bean
getting some staff meeting muffins,

00:49.500 --> 00:51.700
and Kevin, that guy
from behind the counter,

00:51.800 --> 00:54.500
was talking about Hankmed and the Jitney.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.300
- You're famous!
- Yes, we are.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.000
We should get a publicist.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.100
We really should. I've always wanted
a publicist anyway.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.098
That's a great idea.
I'm gonna get on that.

01:02.099 --> 01:02.900
- Right?
- Yeah!

01:02.901 --> 01:05.500
- Awesome.
- Ooh, why don't I do it?

01:05.700 --> 01:09.300
I mean, I know everyone,
and I work very cheap.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.500
- Could you be more perfect?
- I doubt it, but I'll try.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.400
Look at that, would you?

01:15.500 --> 01:16.500
Hazelnut.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.300
- Divya, yeah.
- She likes it.

01:18.301 --> 01:20.399
And given the state
she's in, we pretend to.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.399
Wait, guys. Where is Divya?

01:22.400 --> 01:24.700
- Upstairs asleep.
- Oh, is she not a morning person?

01:24.701 --> 01:27.400
Yes... no, not lately.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.300
Hmm. I gotta go.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.800
Okay. Be heroic, my hero.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.400
- Bye.
- Can do.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.600
Okay, Evan, as much as I like Paige,

01:36.800 --> 01:38.200
we do not want a publicist.

01:38.201 --> 01:41.100
Henry, everyone wants a publicist, okay?

01:41.300 --> 01:43.100
- We need one.
- No, we don't.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.499
Yes... i'm not gonna argue
with you about this,

01:45.500 --> 01:47.098
- all right? But yes, we do.
- Okay, good. No, we don't.

01:47.099 --> 01:48.300
- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.900
- Jill, what do you think?
- I think we should talk about Divya.

01:52.100 --> 01:55.900
Guys, I'm really worried about her.
She's not being herself.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.799
I took her out and I tried to
talk to her about her parents

01:58.800 --> 02:00.499
but got nowhere.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.900
You got farther than I did.
She wouldn't even let me take her out.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.398
- I guess she'll open up when she's ready.
- Yeah.

02:05.399 --> 02:07.900
In the meantime I think it's important
that we keep her mind off of the fact

02:07.901 --> 02:09.900
that her entire life
has totally fallen apart.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
So without further ado,
I would like to announce

02:13.200 --> 02:15.300
the launch of operation KDB.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.700
"Keep Divya Busy".

02:16.900 --> 02:20.600
Um, no, it's actually
"Keep Divya Bu..." yes!

02:21.000 --> 02:22.999
- Wow! Gold star, Hank.
- Thanks.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
And to keep her busy I've
scheduled check-ups with clients,

02:26.100 --> 02:29.100
a trip to restock
medical supplies, a massage,

02:29.200 --> 02:31.600
and a tune-up for my minivan.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.700
That is actually really sweet.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.300
Yeah, Hank's the brains.
I'm the heart, baby.

02:35.301 --> 02:37.800
And the brains
has a new client appointment,

02:38.000 --> 02:39.700
which is short for
new client appointment.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.900
Okay, cool. So it's
just you and me, Jill.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.200
Hey, Jill, you wanna keep me company?

02:43.300 --> 02:45.100
Evan, as much as I would love to stay,

02:45.200 --> 02:48.499
I think it would be a good experience for
me to witness a new client appointment.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.700
- Yeah, see ya, buddy.
- Sorry.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.898
- Okay.
- Great meeting.

02:50.899 --> 02:53.198
That makes a lot of sense for
you to shadow him, it does,

02:53.199 --> 02:54.200
- so...
- Morning.

02:54.300 --> 02:58.000
So I'm just gonna keep the staff meeting
going by myself, all right?

03:00.500 --> 03:02.100
Good morning, sleepyhead.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.699
We got a very busy day, Divya, all right?

03:04.700 --> 03:07.500
Full docket. You and me, you ready to go?

03:08.800 --> 03:10.700
All right, so you
go upstairs and get ready.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.800
You're gonna get ready, right?

03:14.000 --> 03:20.074

03:21.700 --> 03:22.700
Ah.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.100
Uh, excuse me.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.100
Hi, are you Jono?

03:27.400 --> 03:30.300
I'm dr. Lawson, uh, Hank. This is Jill.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.100
- Hi.
- I can't believe my boss called you.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.600
He must be anxious to get his lawn mowed.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.900
Uh, well, he sounded concerned about you,

03:38.100 --> 03:39.800
said you'd been losing weight.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.500
Said you're less talkative.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.000
Maybe because I don't talk to him.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.600
Just my plants. They complain too?

03:49.500 --> 03:51.000
I have a job to do.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Okay.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.100
Do you have high blood pressure?

04:11.600 --> 04:12.600
Okay.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.700
Uh, are you taking any medications?

04:18.399 --> 04:19.899
Can you tell me what kind?

04:20.600 --> 04:23.800
- Yellow.
- Yellow. Okay.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.100
Uh, do you happen to have any
of those yellow pills here?

04:29.700 --> 04:30.700
No.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.499
Yeah, you know, I haven't seen
one of those since med school. That's a...

04:36.500 --> 04:38.400
- Sphygmomanometer.
- Yeah, that's it.

04:38.401 --> 04:41.800
Yeah, we had one in a clinic in Uruguay.
It's an easy way to check blood pressure.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.800
- And a great scrabble board.
- Hmm.

04:43.801 --> 04:46.200
And it works fine for me too.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.800
If you don't mind, I have something
that will work a little better.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.100
Prove it.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.600
- All right, you wanna...
- All right.

05:02.300 --> 05:05.800
And if it doesn't,
this appointment is over.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.300
- 120 over 60.
- 120 over 60.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.600
It works.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.600
And apparently so do the yellow pills.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.400
I told you, I'm fine.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.700
So... good-bye.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.500
Uh, Jono?

05:35.300 --> 05:36.700
Hey, Lawson!

05:38.000 --> 05:39.100
Ken.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.100
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.200
Ken Keller. Ladies call me Killer.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.800
- Jill Casey.
- Which is what the ladies call her.

05:51.801 --> 05:55.300
Hank Lawson, town hero.
I read about your Jitney exploits.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.300
Well done. You must
have a great publicist.

05:57.301 --> 06:00.200
We don't actually
have a publicist, but thanks.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.000
Still, I'm impressed you
found time for little old me.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.000
- It's not you I'm here for.
- Yeah, how is Jono?

06:05.200 --> 06:07.600
His B.P.'s okay. But I'll do some
blood work to make sure.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.800
Okay, well, whatever you need.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.000
I don't need anything.
I'm good, but thank you.

06:11.300 --> 06:14.200
Jono came with the house when I
bought it, now I couldn't do without him.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.400
But lately he's... he's been off.
I wanna make sure he's okay.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.800
Not to mention we got a lot of grounds
work to get ready for the weekend.

06:19.801 --> 06:21.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what's going on?

06:21.900 --> 06:23.700
Oh, it's the fourth
annual kickoff classic.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.500
It's a weekend for us mortals
to play ball with the pros.

06:26.700 --> 06:30.400
You pay to play, and then the proceeds
all go to the Boys & Girls Club of America.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.700
And this year we got
Greg Jennings participating.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.300
- Oh.
- Greg Jennings?

06:34.500 --> 06:37.100
- Of the Green Bay Packers? Really?
- Yeah.

06:37.300 --> 06:41.500
Yeah, you know, Hank, didn't you say
that you used to play ball in school?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.400
Lawson, you told her you played?

06:43.500 --> 06:45.000
Wideout, yeah, until I got injured.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.898
That's funny, I don't remember
you playing when I carried the team

06:46.899 --> 06:48.898
- to the Passaic County championship game.
- Huh.

06:48.899 --> 06:50.700
The Passaic County championship...

06:50.900 --> 06:52.899
- The big time.
- Now, that's actually funny,

06:52.900 --> 06:56.300
since I beat you out for receiver,
you know, until I got injured.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.400
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.798
- Really?
- I'll tell you what, Lawson.

06:59.799 --> 07:02.000
Why don't you join
the event this year, my treat,

07:02.001 --> 07:03.900
and then we'll see who beats who?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.200
- It's all in the name of charity, of course.
- Of course.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.500
I got a busy schedule, and I
think I'm over old rivalries.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.400
You know what I mean, Keller?
Turn the page.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.500
Yeah, wouldn't want you to get injured.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
Game on.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.099
You know, schedule permitting.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.100
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.700
- You take care.
- Okay, great.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.300
- I'm gonna kick your ass, Lawson.
- I know you think you are.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.899
Okay, what's going on between you two?

07:24.900 --> 07:26.400
I have no idea what you're talking about.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.600

Evan! Please touch with your eyes.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.700
Whoa!

08:08.100 --> 08:09.300
Whoa...

08:10.500 --> 08:12.600
Divs, check these out.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.100
- Put them down.
- No, we gotta get these, okay?

08:16.700 --> 08:18.400
You don't even know
what they're used for.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.000
They're scissors.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.400
Who cares what they do. Look at them.
They're, like, they're long and silver, and...

08:24.600 --> 08:26.100
we need these, okay?

08:26.800 --> 08:28.399
We have a long day ahead of us,

08:28.400 --> 08:32.100
so you might wanna pace your judging.

08:32.299 --> 08:34.400
- Just pace it. Okay?
- Mm.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.000
Hua-hua!

08:46.700 --> 08:48.000
Thanks, Mr. Jennings.

08:49.300 --> 08:50.500
Greg, this is my boy, Hank.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.300
- Hey, Hank, how's it goin'?
- It's going great.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.500
We're gonna get this thing started
right here, right now.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.100
- All right, let's do it.
- Adrian. Let's get this going, baby.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.500
Bring it in, guys.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.000
First and foremost, I'd like to thank you guys
for coming out today and supporting the cause.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.800
This weekend is about having fun,

09:06.900 --> 09:09.700
learning, and competing
to the best of your abilities.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.300
Adrian... even though he's a Bronco...

09:12.400 --> 09:14.600
I want you guys to adhere
to what he has to say.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.399
We're gonna start off with some
basic drills. You guys ready to roll?

09:17.400 --> 09:19.600
- Yeah!
- Let's go, get 'em up, get 'em up!

09:20.800 --> 09:23.400
Pick 'em up! Pick 'em up!

09:24.800 --> 09:26.298
- Hank, Hank, Hank.
- Yeah, what's up?

09:26.299 --> 09:28.500
You gotta try a little harder.
This is the gridiron.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.599
Let's go, guys, let's go. Let's go,
let's go, I need to see hustle.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.300
I need to see hu... look, we reacting!

09:33.400 --> 09:36.700
Hank, Hank, come on, Hank.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.300
There we go, there we go.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.900
We're on the gridiron, we work out here.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.300
We work out here, this is
a little different today, huh?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.200
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

09:45.400 --> 09:48.300
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit!
We work, there we go.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.800
We got a group that wants to work.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.600
Don't run me over!

09:54.500 --> 09:56.000
Get 'em up, get 'em up,
pick 'em up, pick 'em up!

09:56.001 --> 09:58.200
- Nice hands.
- Thanks, I'm Hank.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.500
- Hank Lawson.
- Adrian.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.699
Scott, I know.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.098
First round draft pick
of the Denver Broncos. Congrats.

10:03.099 --> 10:04.700
- Thank you.
- So is Ken your agent?

10:04.800 --> 10:06.398
Yeah, we just got back from Denver,

10:06.399 --> 10:08.800
he was visiting training camp.
Ken's the real deal, man.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.400
You know they call him "Killer Keller".

10:10.401 --> 10:11.900
- So I hear.
- Watch out.

10:11.901 --> 10:12.800
Oh!

10:12.900 --> 10:14.498
- Let's go, Hank, keep it moving.
- All right, Greg, you got it.

10:14.499 --> 10:15.898
Jill Casey, this is Greg Jennings.

10:15.899 --> 10:17.198
Jill was just telling me she's a big fan,

10:17.199 --> 10:19.298
and I was telling her
that you're always nice to your fans.

10:19.299 --> 10:21.600
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Jennings.
- Nice to meet you. Would you like an autograph?

10:21.800 --> 10:24.500
Careful, she might wanna hit you up
for some money for a clinic she runs.

10:24.900 --> 10:25.900
That sounds doable.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.499
Maybe we can chat after the event.

10:27.500 --> 10:31.300
Yeah, sure, but, um, that's not
why I wanted to meet you.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.300
No?

10:32.700 --> 10:33.900
Would you like a photo?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.400
Maybe later.

10:35.700 --> 10:39.199
But first, I would love to know

10:39.200 --> 10:42.700
how you were held to one catch
against the Vikings in '09.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.700
You play fantasy football?

10:44.701 --> 10:46.200
I grew up with three brothers.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.600
I traded my second round
draft pick for you.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.400
You were a first alternate to the pro bowl,

10:50.401 --> 10:52.499
you posted back-to-back
thousand yard seasons,

10:52.500 --> 10:54.699
and then one catch?

10:54.700 --> 10:57.799
You do know he scored two touchdowns
in the super bowl which his team also won.

10:57.800 --> 10:58.900
That's great for him.

10:59.300 --> 11:00.799
'09 against the Vikings!

11:00.800 --> 11:02.399
I came back the next game.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.299
Yeah, after I benched you.

11:04.300 --> 11:05.498
- You benched me?
- All right, come on.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.400
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.000
- I benched you.
- Thanks very much, Greg.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.198
- Take care.
- Yeah, we'll talk later.

11:10.199 --> 11:10.900
Benchwarmer.

11:10.901 --> 11:13.400
Uh, Jill, I wouldn't count on
that fund-raising money, come on.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.600
Divya.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.800
This is a no-brainer, right?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.799
Well said. Park the scooter.
You are not buying it.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.000
Uh, looks like you're
not buying anything today.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.000
- Excuse me?
- Your card has been declined.

11:26.001 --> 11:28.199
Okay, that's impossible.
Please run it again.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.500
- I did, twice.
- Okay, let's not get crazy.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.600
It's all good, use mine.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.100
Everything's okay.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
Oh, and we will also be taking these.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.699
Divya, that kind of public humiliation
happens all the time... it's not a big deal.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.000
I didn't say it was a big deal.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.200
Clearly it was a mistake.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.400
Of course it was a mistake.
Look, you know what?

11:51.900 --> 11:53.798
You shouldn't be putting medical supplies
on your card anyway.

11:53.799 --> 11:55.300
I'm gonna get you a Hankmed corporate card.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.598
You won't have to give me receipts anymore,

11:56.599 --> 11:58.300
I won't have to reimburse you anymore.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.200
Everybody wins, okay?

12:00.400 --> 12:01.600
I'll talk to Hank about it.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.200
Okay.

12:03.700 --> 12:04.800
It's fine.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.800
Break!

12:19.600 --> 12:23.000
Jono, since your test results
came back negative, this makes sense.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.400
Aldomet is a pretty old medication.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.300
How long ago did you get these prescribed?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.099
Mid-80s.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.900
These can have side-effects.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.300
Headaches, depression, blurry vision.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.200
Any of that sound familiar?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.999
May I ask, has anything changed
in your personal life recently?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.900
My boss wants to get rid of me.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.599
Well, why would you think that?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.399
He wants a younger caretaker.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.600
Your boss is concerned about you,
as are we.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.200
We are just trying to make sure
that you're healthy.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.500
Newer medication might help that.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.600
My pills have been working fine for years.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.300
- Jono.
- Huh?

13:06.400 --> 13:07.800
What did you do to yourself?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.099
Who knows? Uh, hazard of the trade.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.700
There's something called sporotrichosis.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.399
It is a fungus that you can get

13:15.400 --> 13:17.900
by being pricked by the thorn of a rose.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.300
If left untreated, it will grow.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.200
New lesions will appear along the paths
of your lymph nodes.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.999
It could go into your joints,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.200
your lungs, even your brain.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.298
It could cause some serious damage.

13:30.299 --> 13:31.800
Wait a minute, all this from a rose?

13:31.801 --> 13:34.800
Yes. May I roll up your pant leg?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.200
Did you ever seek medical treatment
for those nodules?

13:46.900 --> 13:49.300
The good news is that it's easy to treat.

13:49.400 --> 13:52.400
Some oral medication,
Itraconazole will clear it up.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.900
I'll write you a prescription.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.299
And, uh, as I said...

13:58.300 --> 14:02.300
a side effect of your old blood pressure
medication is depression...

14:03.500 --> 14:07.000
which could explain why you never
noticed those nodules on your leg.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.200
You didn't care enough.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.200
Along with the Itraconazole,

14:11.201 --> 14:14.000
how about I write you a new blood pressure
medication as well?

14:14.500 --> 14:18.100
If it'll get you to leave me alone.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.900
Cut it out,

14:23.200 --> 14:26.400
or I will use them for
their intended purpose.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.099
42 mau-mau, 42 mau-mau, ready!

14:34.100 --> 14:34.900
Break!

14:36.600 --> 14:37.900
Let's do this, Keller.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.100
This is for you, Lawson.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.200
Ow!

15:00.700 --> 15:03.500
My arm! My arm! My arm!

15:03.600 --> 15:04.698
- Ken.
- Aaah!

15:04.699 --> 15:06.298
From one to ten, ten being unbearable...

15:06.299 --> 15:07.498
I can't count that high!

15:07.499 --> 15:08.700
Okay, let's roll him over.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.000
Easy, easy.

15:14.700 --> 15:15.400
It's my arm!

15:15.401 --> 15:17.000
I know, I know.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.299
Okay, it looks like a
displaced forearm fracture.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.100
The good news is it's not an open fracture,

15:22.101 --> 15:24.499
the bad is you have no radial
or ulnar pulses.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.800
What the hell's an ulnar pulse
and why don't I have one?

15:26.900 --> 15:27.998
Do you have Demerol? Morphine?

15:27.999 --> 15:28.700
I'm on it.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.200
Do you have a splint?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.098
All right, you need a pulse.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.300
There's no blood going to your hand,

15:33.301 --> 15:35.999
which means the tissue in there
is gonna die...fast.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.700
Hey! Hey!

15:39.000 --> 15:41.200
Hey! Hey, stop!

15:42.300 --> 15:43.400
Stop!

15:45.400 --> 15:48.000
Stop! That's my truck!

15:50.300 --> 15:51.500
What do you mean,
you don't have any painkillers?

15:51.501 --> 15:53.000
What kind of a doctor are you?

15:53.600 --> 15:55.800
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay. Calm down, Ken.

15:55.900 --> 15:56.998
If we reduce the fracture,

15:56.999 --> 15:59.498
it'll unkink the arteries and get the blood
flowing back through your arm,

15:59.499 --> 16:01.798
which will do way more than a painkiller
to ease the pain.

16:01.799 --> 16:03.700
- Well, then unkink it.
- Okay, um...

16:05.100 --> 16:07.399
Evan, grab that rope, Keller's bike gloves,

16:07.400 --> 16:09.000
- and a heavy duty stapler.
- Yup.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.600
Divya, hold that.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.500
Hank, what are you doing?

16:30.700 --> 16:31.598
Traction.

16:31.599 --> 16:32.900
Ev, would you grab the rope please?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.900
- I'm gonna lift you up, Ken.
- What? Ow! ow!

16:39.300 --> 16:42.700
Now, Evan, gently start pulling
until I tell you.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.600
Seriously?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.200
This is gonna be a little uncomfortable.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.400
Oh...

16:49.700 --> 16:50.900
Okay, pull.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.800
Hard, Ev! That's it, that's it, pull!

16:54.700 --> 16:56.500
Harder! Harder!

16:57.100 --> 16:58.300
Good.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.000
Okay, let go, let go.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.400
Perfect.

17:02.300 --> 17:03.899
All right, pulse is two-plus.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.800
- How's the pain?
- It's better.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.900
Good. Now I'll put a splint on and get you
to the hospital for an X-ray.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.500
Outpatient, right?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.500
FYI, if we're late for the massage,

17:20.800 --> 17:22.499
uh, they don't prorate it, so...

17:22.500 --> 17:23.300
Evan.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
I do not want a massage.

17:25.700 --> 17:29.499
A person was in serious jeopardy today
because my car was towed away.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.698
Hank said he's gonna be fine.

17:30.699 --> 17:31.500
No thanks to me.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.900
Yeah, but... uh...

17:33.900 --> 17:35.000
all right, all right.

17:35.100 --> 17:38.499
So I guess it's safe to say
that you don't wanna go get my minivan

17:38.500 --> 17:40.099
tuned up either, right?

17:40.100 --> 17:41.198
Okay, that's fine, that's good.

17:41.199 --> 17:42.900
Then let's find something
else to do, Divya.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.200
We gotta find something to do, and...

17:47.400 --> 17:48.900
I mean, we could...

17:49.900 --> 17:51.900
just talk about it.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Talk about what?

17:53.001 --> 17:54.500
I don't know, how about the fact

17:54.501 --> 17:57.200
that you're like this
poor little homeless orphan girl

17:57.300 --> 17:59.600
like out of a Dickens novel...

18:00.600 --> 18:02.099
dressed in Dolce & Gabbana.

18:02.100 --> 18:03.100
And your point is?

18:03.101 --> 18:05.899
You've got problems.
So let's problem solve, Divya. Come on,

18:05.900 --> 18:08.399
let's... let's, uh,
let's start with the Mercedes.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.000
The Mercedes, it was yours,
or it was leased to you.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.100
It was in my father's name.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.000
That's unfortunate. Okay, um, wow.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.900
God, I gotta say I'm a little surprised
your mom didn't give you a head's up.

18:19.901 --> 18:21.699
Like even just a text saying,

18:21.700 --> 18:24.398
by the way, Divya, you might wanna
have a friend pick you up from work today.

18:24.399 --> 18:26.600
Hey, Evan, I do not want
to talk about my family.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.300
But that's the only way you're gonna...

18:29.700 --> 18:30.598
get better.

18:30.599 --> 18:32.500
I don't need you to make me feel better.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.199
But you're an over-accessorized
emotional volcano waiting to erupt.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.300
Evan.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.699
I am fine, please... just forget about it.

18:41.700 --> 18:42.798
So when you say "forget about it",

18:42.799 --> 18:44.398
what I think you're
really trying to tell me

18:44.399 --> 18:46.300
- is "Evan, I need a friend right now".
- Evan!

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
I give you my word. I will tell you
when I want you to be my friend.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.200
Okay?

18:53.700 --> 18:54.800
Good.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.100
I will see you tomorrow.

19:09.700 --> 19:10.800
I didn't say anything.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.100
Hey, thanks for coming. Come on in.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.599
Yeah, sure.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.898
Is your arm feeling worse?

19:34.899 --> 19:37.200
No, no, I didn't call you here
for my arm, it's, uh, it's Jono.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.800
He's not looking any better.

19:38.801 --> 19:40.298
Well, Divya, my P.A., saw him,

19:40.299 --> 19:42.398
gave him a prescription
for a new medication. It should help.

19:42.399 --> 19:43.600
He's never gonna fill it.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.100
He doesn't leave the grounds.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.798
I can't get the man to take a vacation.

19:46.799 --> 19:48.600
Maybe because he thinks
you're gonna fire him.

19:48.601 --> 19:49.600
Fire him?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.400
- He told you that?
- Mm-hmm.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.100
Is that our game against Montclair?

19:54.500 --> 19:56.000
This isn't as pathetic as it looks.

19:56.001 --> 19:58.199
No, no, no, lots of grown men sit alone

19:58.200 --> 20:00.199
and watch footage
from their high school games.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.698
The word wallowing never entered my mind.

20:01.699 --> 20:04.200
I was trying to find evidence of you
actually being on our passaic high team.

20:04.201 --> 20:05.600
Okay, detective.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.400
How do you even have
film of our old games?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.000
Well, my father taped every one of them.

20:09.100 --> 20:12.500
And our practices, and our
scrimmages. He played to win.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.600
He had me believing I could go pro.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.900
All 165 scrawny pounds of me.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.500
Come on.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.900
I remember your dad.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.600
Yeah, I was always jealous of
how much he was around.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.200
Mm. A blessing and a curse.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.300
Yeah, no, I guess he was kind of intense.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.500
Mm, he made the great Santini
look like the great Gazoo.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.200
That must have been tough.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.100
Thanks.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.600
Nice grab.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.600
Thank you.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.800
It's funny, I don't remember your dad.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.000
My father never missed an
opportunity to miss a game.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.600
Where is he now?

21:04.900 --> 21:06.200
In prison.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.800
Yours?

21:11.200 --> 21:13.100
My dad died a few years ago.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.800
To messed-up fathers.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.100
Chocolate chip cookies, pretzels,

21:33.200 --> 21:36.000
uh, eye cream, face cream, foot cream.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.500
I'm guessing the air in prison
isn't very hydrating.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.400
Probably a good guess.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.800
Uh, an envelope from Ms. Newberg
labeled "Boudoir pics", and...

21:42.900 --> 21:45.700
Let's just stop right
there. "Boudoir pics"?

21:45.800 --> 21:48.000
- It's sweet.
- Ugh!

21:48.100 --> 21:51.000
- Hey.
- Hi. The care package is done.

21:51.200 --> 21:51.900
Do you wanna know what's in it?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.400
No, no, no, he doesn't.you
really don't, trust me.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.500
- Uh, I guess I don't.
- Oh, all right.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.800
Must be so weird sending
your dad stuff in prison.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.700
It's even harder with him
not wanting us to visit him.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.600
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

22:02.700 --> 22:05.300
Thanks. My night on the couch?

22:05.600 --> 22:06.800
Divya upstairs?

22:06.900 --> 22:09.700
Yup, asleep. For a while.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.300
It's that bad?

22:15.600 --> 22:19.800
I think her family was paying for everything.
She never cashed her paychecks.

22:19.900 --> 22:22.900
Wait, Divya hasn't deposited any of her
checks since Hankmed started?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.200
A couple, tops.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.500
God, I'm worried about her.

22:25.600 --> 22:31.100
Me too. No Raj, no family,
no home, no car. Just us.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.500
Yeah, she's in worse
shape than I thought.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.700
Well, I'm gonna go.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.000
Okay.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.800
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.400
Oh, did you see this?

22:42.500 --> 22:44.700
- What?
- I'm so proud of him.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.300
I put a copy in the package for your dad.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.600
Wow. Can't wait to read this.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.100
Oh, keep it. I bought 50 copies.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.000
Okay, great, thanks.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.700
- Bye, babe.
- Ciao.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.000
I thought I told you
I don't want publicity.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.300
Why do you get to decide?

22:59.400 --> 23:03.800
I don't, but we have to
agree, right? So convince me.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.100
You want me to walk you through it?

23:05.200 --> 23:06.000
- Okay.
- Right now

23:06.100 --> 23:08.800
people are talking about Hankmed
'cause of what we did at the Jitney.

23:08.900 --> 23:12.400
In order to capitalize on that, we need
to strike now, while the iron's hot.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.500
There's no iron, okay?
And I don't wanna strike.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.600
I'm the businessman. It's
my job to grow the business.

23:18.700 --> 23:21.000
Not this business, not this way.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.400
- Good night!
- Good night!

23:27.400 --> 23:28.500
So we matched the teams up,

23:28.600 --> 23:33.200
and the top scorers tied for first
are Hank Lawson and Ken Keller.

23:33.300 --> 23:36.600
And let's hear it for Ken and his
courageous effort to play through pain.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.600
Hey, guys, let's play some football.

23:42.700 --> 23:44.900
- All right, let's do it!
- Let's play some football.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.300
Hey, Ken, listen, I know you want to win,
and you've been medically cleared to play.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.900
But please be careful with your arm.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.400
- All right.
- All right.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.400
Oh, uh, I don't think it's the
greatest time for fund-raising.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.400
Yeah, Jill, I hate to
agree with this guy, but...

23:55.500 --> 23:56.700
No, Hank, this is important.

23:56.800 --> 23:57.800
Okay.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.700
- What's up?
- It's Keller's blood work from the hospital.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.500
He's got an elevated hematocrit level.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.200
You think he's blood doping?

24:06.300 --> 24:08.700
That, or he's a freak of nature.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.900
You really think he would cheat
to win a charity event?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Huddle up or cuddle up, Lawson!

24:14.600 --> 24:16.200
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.000
You again.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.900
Me again.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.900
Following up to see how
the sporotrichosis is doing.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.100
Better.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.800
But I haven't found time
to fill that prescription.

24:32.900 --> 24:36.600
You know, I had a feeling that
you'd have trouble getting there.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.300
Why do you keep coming around here?

24:39.400 --> 24:40.700
Some people admire persistence.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.300
Well, I'm not one of them.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.600
My father had a little garden
in our backyard growing up.

24:45.900 --> 24:48.900
Sometimes I would sneak in
and talk to the flowers.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.700
He told me that plants like that.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.200
Your father's a smart man.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.300
He doesn't talk to me now.

24:57.900 --> 24:59.300
Is that an orchid?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.700
Paphiopedilum.

25:10.800 --> 25:15.300
Lady Slipper. It's very rare. It's
one of my favorite flowers.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.100
Well, they're beautiful.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.300
Yeah.

25:21.100 --> 25:25.700
When Mr. Keller
replaces me, what do I do?

25:25.800 --> 25:28.400
I really doubt that he
is trying to replace you.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.900
How can you be so sure?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.400
You're right, I can't.

25:32.900 --> 25:35.300
But I can tell you that like depression,

25:35.400 --> 25:39.100
paranoia is another side
effect of your old medication.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.400
You have to want to
take care of yourself.

25:45.800 --> 25:50.000
These flowers are my friends.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.800
This is my home.

25:53.500 --> 25:58.500
For over 40 years.

25:59.500 --> 26:03.100
It has got to be hard to be around
the things that you love the most

26:03.200 --> 26:05.000
and not be able to love them.

26:05.100 --> 26:10.400
But that is what depression
can be, not feeling like... you.

26:11.100 --> 26:16.200
It may take a couple of weeks.
But hopefully these will help.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.400
If you decide to try them.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.700
Divya.

26:24.100 --> 26:29.400
Why doesn't... your father talk to you?

26:29.900 --> 26:33.100
I could give you a bunch of reasons.

26:33.900 --> 26:36.300
But when it comes down to it...

26:37.900 --> 26:40.000
I don't understand any of them.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.800
I'm sorry.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.400
Thank you.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.000
So am I.

26:54.900 --> 26:55.800
Break!

26:55.900 --> 26:57.600
All right, boys, let's do this!

27:15.000 --> 27:16.200
I got it!

27:18.600 --> 27:20.400
Henry! Lawson!

27:20.500 --> 27:22.200
Is real awesome!

27:22.300 --> 27:24.300
Let's go, Keller. What you got, Keller?

27:27.600 --> 27:30.200
Here we go. Make a play,
make a play! Make a play!

27:41.800 --> 27:43.200
Go, go, go!

27:44.000 --> 27:45.500
Make a play! There we go.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.400
What the hell was that?

27:50.600 --> 27:52.700
He's goin' right, he's goin' right!

27:54.700 --> 27:56.700
Go, go, go, go, 25!

27:57.600 --> 28:01.300
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God! Yes! Yes!

28:05.000 --> 28:06.100
Hi.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.600
You here to cheer on Hank?

28:11.700 --> 28:13.300
Uh, just checking in on Jono.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.700
The gardener.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.300
That's funny, didn't he
tell us to leave him alone?

28:17.400 --> 28:19.100
Well, I chose to ignore that.

28:19.900 --> 28:23.100
So that's how I should handle you
telling me the exact same thing?

28:23.900 --> 28:26.200
Divya, look, I know you
have a lot going on.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.800
Maybe I haven't gone about being
there for you in the most helpful way.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.800
I have nothing going on.

28:32.800 --> 28:36.900
Just watching a bunch of
out of shape potential clients

28:37.000 --> 28:40.100
sadly trying to recapture
their glory days.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.600
You don't have to go through this alone.

28:42.700 --> 28:45.800
With you in my face every
minute, I am hardly alone.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.600
What your parents did, cutting
you off, cutting you out...

28:49.700 --> 28:51.200
how could parents not
want to see their own kid?

28:51.300 --> 28:53.900
Are we talking about me?
Or are we talking about you?

28:54.700 --> 28:57.400
Your father disappeared for 20 years.

28:57.500 --> 29:00.600
And now he doesn't even want
you to visit him in prison.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.900
Maybe you should worry
about your own family.

29:08.900 --> 29:09.900
- Ready...
- Break!

29:10.000 --> 29:11.600
Let's go, Mike, let's go!

29:11.800 --> 29:13.400
Come on, Lawson!

29:14.400 --> 29:15.400
- Here we go, Lawson!
- Bring it, Keller!

29:15.500 --> 29:17.600
25,25!

29:23.200 --> 29:25.100
Oh, my God!

29:25.200 --> 29:27.200
Yes! Yes!

29:27.300 --> 29:28.500
That's my brother!

29:28.600 --> 29:29.500
- That's a trap!
- Really? Good catch!

29:29.600 --> 29:31.200
It looks like a catch to me, Keller!

29:31.300 --> 29:32.200
What is that?

29:32.300 --> 29:35.400
That's a trap and you know
it! You know it, buddy.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.800
- Ken, relax, relax.
- You relax! It's a trap...

29:39.900 --> 29:41.300
Stop! Stop!

29:41.400 --> 29:43.200
There's something wrong with your hand.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.300
Is your arm hurting?

29:44.400 --> 29:45.500
- I play through pain.
- Calm down.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.200
- How much pain?
- It was a lot, now it's numb.

29:48.300 --> 29:49.400
Okay, we gotta get that cast off.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.100
- I need to see your arm.
- Why?

29:51.200 --> 29:53.300
Because if you have what I
think you have, you could lose it.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.500
We need to bivalve the cast.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.000
- What does bivalve mean?
- Cut it off.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.900
I got something you could use. Right here.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.300
- Why do you have rectal scissors?
- Well, I... they're Divya's.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.600
- I've got something better.
- Thank you, perfect.

30:20.300 --> 30:21.500
What the...

30:24.500 --> 30:27.300
Easy, just lean back. That's it.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.300
Okay, Ken, can you wiggle your fingers?

30:29.800 --> 30:32.200
Oh, pins and needles. Really sharp pins
and really jagged needles.

30:32.201 --> 30:35.000
- Paresthesia.
- With pain, pallor, and poor pulse.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.700
Okay, Peter Piper, bottom line it.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.200
It looks like you've developed
compartment syndrome in your forearm.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.299
It's a complication from
yesterday's fracture.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.398
What is compartment syndrome?

30:42.399 --> 30:44.800
It's a dangerous compression of
the nerves, blood vessels,

30:44.801 --> 30:47.298
and swollen muscle tissue
within the enclosed space,

30:47.299 --> 30:49.200
hence compartment, of your volar forearm.

30:49.201 --> 30:52.100
The increased pressure's not
allowing your blood to circulate.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.500
I've called an ambulance.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.398
No, no, I'm not going back to that hospital.
My arm lookslike nuclear waste.

30:56.399 --> 30:58.100
They screwed up when they put my cast on.

30:58.200 --> 31:01.599
Right now the muscles, tendons, and nerves
in your arm are dying of ischemia.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.899
It can be irreversible.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.598
Find someone to get me
a Medivac into the city?

31:04.599 --> 31:05.398
- Okay?
- Got it.

31:05.399 --> 31:06.600
This is time-sensitive.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.398
Well, then how have I been
living with it since yesterday?

31:08.399 --> 31:10.700
Because yesterday the pressure
in your arm wasn't acute.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.100
You need to relieve the pressure.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.899
Ken, this isn't about you and me.

31:13.900 --> 31:15.700
It's serious. You need to trust me.

31:15.701 --> 31:19.499
Trust is wonderful, but I refuse to buy that I
can't get myself to a world-class facility.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.300
I can't prove it to you.
If we were in a hospital,

31:21.301 --> 31:24.699
I'd use a stryker monitor to measure the
exact pressure-level building in your arm.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.000
But here there's...

31:28.200 --> 31:29.300
Jill.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.600
Maybe we can measure the pressure.

31:32.000 --> 31:32.800
I'm on it.

31:33.700 --> 31:37.000
If I do, will you get in
the ambulance when it arrives?

31:38.200 --> 31:39.700
- Do it.
- Okay.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.199
Ev, use your favorite scissors
to open and cut these tubes.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.200
You got it.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.800
- Good.
- Here you go.

32:02.100 --> 32:03.300
Stopcock.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.100
Okay.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.600
Divya, syringe.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.900
Open that.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.300
- Jill, you hold the manometer.
- Mm-hmm.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.300
Okay, Divya.
Pull slowly up on the syringe.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.000
It's more than halfway full.

32:38.900 --> 32:40.600
Okay, good, perfect.

32:40.900 --> 32:44.000
Now, take the syringe off,
pull it up to 15, and then put it back on.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.799
Okay, Ken, this will cause the meniscus,

32:47.800 --> 32:50.399
the fluid level of the saline,
to bubble away from your arm.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.900
And it's gonna hurt a little.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.800
Mm!

32:55.300 --> 32:58.200
Okay, Divya, slowly increase
the pressure on the syringe.

32:59.300 --> 33:01.100
Jill, is the mercury rising?

33:02.300 --> 33:03.900
- Yup.
- Okay, now we're gonna wait

33:03.901 --> 33:07.800
until the line along the fluid in the tube
curves from convex to concave.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.500
Okay, there it is.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.600
Ken, if the mercury's
greater than 30, you are acute,

33:12.601 --> 33:15.300
which means if you like your arm,
you have no time to waste.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.800
- Jill?
- It's approaching 45.

33:17.900 --> 33:20.000
- And rising fast.
- Ken...

33:21.200 --> 33:23.400
- You win, this time.
- Okay, good.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.700
Guys, Hamptons Heritage, quickly.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.500
How's Mr. Keller?

33:33.700 --> 33:35.700
- He's gonna be okay.
- Good.

33:36.500 --> 33:40.000
- I brought you something.
- You brought me something? Why?

33:40.700 --> 33:42.900
Well, you gave me something to help,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.200
I give you something to help.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.900
I feel better already. Thank you, Jono.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.000
Now, take careof yourself, okay?

33:52.600 --> 33:53.800
You too.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.200
So nice.

33:59.500 --> 34:03.100
So how did you know that
he was depressed and not just sad?

34:03.200 --> 34:05.100
What Jono was experiencing...

34:05.200 --> 34:07.400
lingering malaise for no reason...

34:07.600 --> 34:09.400
- that's depression.
- Okay.

34:09.500 --> 34:13.300
Sadness is temporary.
It has a direct cause.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.000
A, uh, setback, or a disappointment.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.199
Got it.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.600
So which one are you
feeling about your parents?

34:24.000 --> 34:25.500
That's sadness.

34:27.100 --> 34:28.900
I'm sad about losing them.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.800
And I'm sad about what they've done.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.600
I'm sad about all of it.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.800
I'm sorry. I really am.
I hate seeing you like this.

34:41.900 --> 34:44.300
Am I allowed to say anything?

34:45.500 --> 34:47.300
- Use your best judgment.
- It's about your parents.

34:47.301 --> 34:48.800
Your best judgment, Evan.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.000
If they won't have you,

34:51.199 --> 34:55.600
just know you can crash with us
for as long as you want.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.500
Thank you.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.400
Without my family support,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
I'm basically starting from scratch.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.800
You're gonna start cashing
all your checks now, aren't you?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.400
I'm afraid so.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.500
And now I'm sad.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.600
I don't think that's gonna work.

35:23.700 --> 35:25.400
Can we talk about this later?

35:25.500 --> 35:28.200
Ooh, regular coffee
never tasted this good.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.399
'cause of the hazelnut and Divya...

35:30.400 --> 35:32.999
- Okay, I gotta go.
- You're on the phone. I'm sorry.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.600
Because I can't talk about it right now.

35:34.601 --> 35:37.799
Okay, bye. Hi, Hank.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.800
Sorry, I didn't... uh, you heading in?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.800
Uh, yeah.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.400
You want some company?

35:43.800 --> 35:44.800
No.

35:44.900 --> 35:48.800
Paige, I hope Evan explained that my feelings
about a publicist have nothing to do with you.

35:48.900 --> 35:50.400
I just don't want one.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.100
- One what?
- A publicist.

35:53.300 --> 35:56.900
Oh, no, I don't care about that.
It's not a good time, Hank.

35:58.700 --> 35:59.900
I'm sorry.

36:00.300 --> 36:03.900
I just got some really bad news.
Maybe you could help me.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.500
Yeah, I'm happy to try.

36:05.700 --> 36:09.500
Would it be covered under the
doctor-patient confidentiality?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.200
Is it medical in nature?

36:11.600 --> 36:12.600
Yes.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.900
Unfortunately.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.900
Then, uh, yeah. Yeah, it would.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.800
- Okay.
- But, Paige, first let me just say,

36:22.600 --> 36:23.900
um, Evan loves you.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.699
And I'm a little concerned about
my knowing something about you

36:26.700 --> 36:28.400
that you don't want him to know.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.200
It could put all of us in
a really tricky situation.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.100
No, no, I didn't even
think of it that way.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.800
I could find you an excellent doctor.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.700
No, no, no. No, please.

36:37.300 --> 36:40.600
Just don't say anything to Evan. Okay?

36:54.700 --> 36:55.800
Hi.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.700
I thought you said he never leaves.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.300
He came to see how I was.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.600
- That's nice of him.
- I told him to leave town.

37:01.700 --> 37:03.699
- You fired him?
- I sent him on vacation.

37:03.700 --> 37:05.800
I told him if he didn't
get some rest, I would fire him.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.600
That's nice of you.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.400
Well, I'm not such a bad guy.

37:09.500 --> 37:10.700
About that.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.700
I wanted to apologize.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.500
For getting carried away.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.100
For letting the spirit of competition
change who I am.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.700
I'm not proud of
some of the things I said,

37:22.200 --> 37:23.800
and I'm sorry.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.700
Okay.

37:27.100 --> 37:30.499
Oh, by the way, if you wanted to apologize
this would be a good time to do it.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.800
- Yeah, not gonna happen.
- Right. Okay.

37:34.900 --> 37:38.299
Look, Ken, I'm concerned
about the compartment syndrome

37:38.300 --> 37:40.300
in connection
with your elevated hematocrit.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.300
Is there any chance
you were blood doping?

37:42.400 --> 37:44.500
- Transfusing yourself?
- Blood doping? No way.

37:44.600 --> 37:48.000
Then I'm concerned you could be suffering
from a serious blood disorder,

37:48.200 --> 37:51.399
one of several polycythemias
that could be chronic and debilitating.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.500
English, Lawson.

37:52.501 --> 37:55.000
You could be in need of
periodic bloodlettings.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.800
Without a clear explanation
as to why your levels were high,

37:58.100 --> 37:59.600
you need to undergo a series of tests.

37:59.700 --> 38:02.200
I've recommended a specialist
stop by and start examining...

38:02.300 --> 38:04.000
All right, what if
there is an explanation?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.600
Then I would love to hear it.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.800
- When I went to Colorado to go visit Adrian...
- Mm-hmm.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.500
I really went to go spend
some time in a high altitude

38:11.800 --> 38:14.300
to get some more oxygen
into my red blood cells.

38:15.300 --> 38:17.100
Give myself a competitive edge.

38:17.500 --> 38:18.700
Okay, then.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.100
This event supports a great cause.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.000
You putting it on is amazing.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.000
And while I know you like to win,

38:26.100 --> 38:28.899
you might wanna focus less
on getting a competitive advantage

38:28.900 --> 38:30.500
and try having a little fun too.

38:30.700 --> 38:33.399
Yeah, yeah, you're right. It's just...
it's not as easy as it used to be.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.200
You know what I'm talking about,
you must be as sore as I am.

38:35.201 --> 38:38.600
Not at all. I'm amazed at how good
it felt to be back on the field.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.000
Just like old times.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.600
- Yeah.
- You know?

38:44.600 --> 38:46.300
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:47.300 --> 38:49.100
Well, maybe you'll come
play with us again next year.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.500
I would like that.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.299
Take care of yourself, Ken, huh?

38:52.300 --> 38:54.000
- You too, Lawson.
- All right, buddy.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.000
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

39:01.200 --> 39:05.000
Hot bath, Epsom salts, lots of Advil.

39:05.100 --> 39:07.300
Yes, doctor. Easy on the bumps.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.400
I would like to apologize

39:13.900 --> 39:18.200
for allowing my personal life to
interfere with my Hankmed responsibilities.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.900
And I would like to thank you both

39:21.100 --> 39:23.000
for opening up your home to me.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.499
Okay, Boris's home.
And for being my family.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.500
I don't know what
I would do without you two.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.600
- It's us I'd be worried about.
- Yeah.

39:30.700 --> 39:33.700
And Evan, I am so sorry
about that father crack.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.400
It was a cheap shot.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.400
You were right, actually.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.900
Well, at least
your father takes your calls.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.099
He's in prison. His options are limited.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.100
That's not why he takes your calls.

39:45.700 --> 39:46.900
He loves you.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.800
He wants to hear your voices.
It makes him happy.

39:49.900 --> 39:52.100
You have no idea
what I would give for that.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.700
Yeah, Evan. Still sad.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.100
But working on it.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.200
Well...

40:00.000 --> 40:03.700
we, uh, happen to have
a little surprise for you.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.100
It's designed to cheer you up.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.100
I hate surprises.

40:08.300 --> 40:09.198
What is it?

40:09.199 --> 40:10.500
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Greg.

40:10.501 --> 40:13.400
- Hey, Mr. Jennings.
- My own live football star?

40:13.500 --> 40:14.999
Greg's not the surprise.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.200
Okay, so then tell me that that trophy
does not say "World's Greatest P.A."

40:18.300 --> 40:22.200
Sorry, though I'm sure you are.
This is for Hank.

40:22.300 --> 40:25.700
MVP of this year's kickoff classic.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.698
- Really?
- Whoa, what?

40:26.699 --> 40:27.698
- Yeah!
- All right!

40:27.699 --> 40:29.300
- Thank you, thank you!
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!

40:29.301 --> 40:31.300
And before I forget,

40:31.900 --> 40:34.300
- here's the ticket to the pro bowl.
- Oh, baby.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.000
There's only one. I thought the MVP was
supposed to get two tickets, though, right?

40:37.001 --> 40:39.599
The score was so close
the judges couldn't decide,

40:39.600 --> 40:42.499
so they named Ken and Hank co-MVPs.

40:42.500 --> 40:43.200
What?

40:43.201 --> 40:46.000
So you and Mr. Keller
can go to the game together.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.100
- BFFs.
- Cute.

40:48.500 --> 40:51.700
Uh, and Greg, thanks. Jill said you
wrote a very nice check to the clinic.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.100
Yeah, well, I felt bad about
that Vikings game in '09, so...

40:54.101 --> 40:55.800
- Right.
- Well, I gotta run.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.000
Oh, just out of curiosity,

40:57.001 --> 41:00.000
who owns the sweet ride out front?
I was just thinking about buying one.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.399
What? Evan's minivan?

41:01.400 --> 41:04.900
That is no minivan.
It's a Range Rover vintage.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.300
- With a big red bow on top.
- Hey, Greg.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.200
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

41:12.200 --> 41:13.999
You didn't. He didn't, he didn't.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
- I'm afraid we did!
- Oh!

41:15.001 --> 41:18.899
Before you get too excited, though,
just full disclosure... it's gently used.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.100
Gently, okay?

41:21.500 --> 41:23.300
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.200
You think she's sad it's not a Mercedes?

41:28.201 --> 41:29.700
Yeah, she looks crushed.

41:30.300 --> 41:32.500
Ev, it was a great idea.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.700
Every once in a while I have one.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.000
You had two this week.

41:37.100 --> 41:40.100
I did. I did?

41:42.100 --> 41:43.500
Help the girl out.

41:46.300 --> 41:47.300
Gladly.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.300
- Hey, Div!
- No running... scissors.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.600
Excusez-moi, mademoiselle. Allow me.

41:52.900 --> 41:53.900
Amazing.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.900
Such a smooth cut. Hop in.

41:58.500 --> 42:01.300
Watch your legs. Heh, heh.

42:03.900 --> 42:06.499
Just as you know,
if our company were bigger,

42:06.500 --> 42:08.499
we could afford to get her Mercedes back.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.500
- Evan.
- Look,

42:09.501 --> 42:11.600
I'm not giving up on growing our business.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.100
You think I don't know that?
