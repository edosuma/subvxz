01:21.450 --> 01:24.620
Man who catch fly with chopstick...

01:24.710 --> 01:26.620
accomplish anything.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.210
You ever catch one?

01:30.290 --> 01:31.920
Not yet.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.110
What was that you were doing
on those stumps over there?

01:59.200 --> 02:02.410
- Called "crane technique."
- Does it work?

02:02.490 --> 02:05.410
If do right, no can defense.

02:05.450 --> 02:07.040
Could you teach me?

02:07.120 --> 02:10.580
First learn stand,
then learn fly.

02:10.669 --> 02:13.170
Nature rule, Daniel-san.
Not mine.

02:13.250 --> 02:16.470
- Where'd you learn it from?
- Father teach.

02:16.510 --> 02:19.430
- You must have had some father.
- Oh, yes.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.570
"Valor."

03:11.020 --> 03:13.360
Johnny, leave him alone!
He's had enough!

03:13.440 --> 03:17.070
- I'll decide when he's had enough!
- What is wrong with you?

03:17.150 --> 03:19.070
- An enemy deserves no mercy!
- Right!

03:19.150 --> 03:20.740
- No mercy!
- Right!

03:20.820 --> 03:21.860
You're crazy!

03:27.080 --> 03:29.540
Tommy, Bobby, get him!

03:39.880 --> 03:42.130
Mercy is for the weak.

03:42.220 --> 03:45.140
Here, on the street,
in competition...

03:45.220 --> 03:47.260
a man confronts you,
he is the enemy.

03:47.350 --> 03:51.100
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

03:53.980 --> 03:56.900
Come on, let's forget this.

03:56.940 --> 03:59.440
Wait. Not yet.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.070
Time out.

04:01.150 --> 04:03.110
Go to your sensei.
Turn. Kneel.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.450
Johnny, you're a cream puff!

04:07.620 --> 04:09.080
Sweep the leg.

04:11.290 --> 04:13.580
You have a problem with that?

04:15.580 --> 04:17.040
No, Sensei.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.589
No mercy.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.440
It's over, Johnny!
You did it!

04:43.610 --> 04:45.990
LaRusso, you okay?
Can you go on?

04:46.030 --> 04:47.780
Get him a body bag!

04:49.160 --> 04:51.500
- All right, feet.
- Do it again!

04:51.580 --> 04:54.670
That's a warning for
illegal contact to the knee.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.830
Finish it!
No mercy!

04:56.920 --> 04:59.590
No mercy!
Way to finish, Johnny!

04:59.670 --> 05:00.920
Finish him!

05:10.140 --> 05:11.140
Winner!

05:26.450 --> 05:29.530
Hey, Mr. Miyagi,
you know, I was thinking.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.200
About what, Daniel-san?

05:31.290 --> 05:34.330
That maybe we should have
a strategy now, you know?

05:34.410 --> 05:35.830
For what?

05:35.920 --> 05:38.710
My future.
My whole tournament career.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.800
Miyagi already have one.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.920
Really? What is it?

05:45.010 --> 05:46.470
Early retirement.

05:55.770 --> 05:57.770
Ali and mother
wait for us at restaurant.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.610
I know. I'm starving.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.650
- That was great.
- Thank you.

06:01.690 --> 06:05.690
LaRusso, very impressive win.
You showed a lot of poise.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.070
People are gonna be talking about that
last kick for years. Congratulations.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.580
Get out of my way!
Out of my way!

06:11.660 --> 06:14.580
- What you doin' to the brother?
- Don't play with me.

06:15.660 --> 06:17.120
Excuse me.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.300
Why does he act like that?

06:32.390 --> 06:35.850
That guy just doesn't know
what karate's all about.

06:35.890 --> 06:39.150
- Well, maybe he should learn.
- Would you like to teach him?

06:40.440 --> 06:42.610
- Good luck, Daniel.
- Thanks.

06:42.690 --> 06:44.110
- Take care.
- Thanks.

06:44.150 --> 06:46.530
Oy, keep ladies waiting.

06:48.650 --> 06:50.610
- Wait, wait!
- What?

06:50.660 --> 06:53.950
- Could we have your autograph?
- Yeah, man!

06:53.990 --> 06:56.290
- So, how you guys doin'?
- Great.

06:56.370 --> 06:58.460
Oh, yeah?
Where are you from?

06:58.540 --> 07:00.670
- Reseda.
- You're from Res...

07:00.750 --> 07:03.540
I'm from Reseda.
I moved there a couple months ago.

07:03.630 --> 07:05.880
- Maybe we'll see you sometime.
- Daniel-san.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.760
- What?
- Come. Getting late.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.340
It's the price of fame.
Gotta get used to it.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.050
Take it easy.
Maybe I'll see you.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.760
That's not fair.
I got second place.

07:15.850 --> 07:18.310
Second place is no place!
You're off the team!

07:18.390 --> 07:20.310
- I did my best.
- What did you say?

07:20.390 --> 07:23.270
- I did my best.
- You're nothin'! You're a loser!

07:23.360 --> 07:25.900
- No, you're the loser.
- I'm the loser, huh?

07:29.150 --> 07:32.030
- Now who's the loser?
- You're really sick, man.

07:35.030 --> 07:37.500
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Don't!

07:37.540 --> 07:40.040
How does second place
feel now, huh?

07:40.120 --> 07:42.250
- He can't breathe!
- Mind your business.

07:42.330 --> 07:44.420
- You're gonna kill him!
- Sensei, please.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.250
You're hurting him.
He's sorry. He really is.

07:49.380 --> 07:51.590
- Let him go.
- Mr. Miyagi's right.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.140
Let him go!

07:53.180 --> 07:55.220
I said, let him go!

07:55.300 --> 07:57.600
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.720
Mercy is for the weak.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.970
We do not train
to be merciful here.

08:40.059 --> 08:43.190
A man face you, he is enemy.

08:43.230 --> 08:47.110
Enemy deserve no mercy.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.710
Daniel-san,
ladies no wait forever.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.170
You could've killed him,
couldn't you?

09:06.210 --> 09:08.590
- Oy.
- Why didn't you then?

09:08.670 --> 09:12.760
Because, Daniel-san, for person
with no forgiveness in heart...

09:12.800 --> 09:15.890
Iiving even worse punishment
than death.

10:12.650 --> 10:15.740
Oh, Daniel-san,
must have been some senior prom.

10:15.820 --> 10:18.200
- What happened?
- You mean, what didn't happen.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.990
First I let Ali borrow the car,
and she redesigns my fender.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.700
I don't know what she did to the engine,
but that ain't runnin' right either.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.210
And you know what else she does?

10:27.250 --> 10:31.250
Tells me that she's just fallen in love
with some football player from UCLA.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.380
- Why didn't she just lie?
- Things could be worse.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.460
Don't worry about it.
They are.

10:35.550 --> 10:39.090
Last night I find out my mom
got picked by a company to go to Fresno.

10:39.140 --> 10:43.560
Two months. We leave tomorrow afternoon.
I gotta spend my whole summer in Fresno.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.940
You're not gonna
be able to fix that.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.190
How'd you do that?

10:53.230 --> 10:54.900
What'd you do?

10:56.190 --> 10:59.160
- Come. Miyagi tell you later.
- Where we goin'?

10:59.240 --> 11:02.200
I have just the thing
make you feel better.

11:03.450 --> 11:06.500
- Probably got work for me to do.
- Hit nail on head.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.290
How come every time I have a problem,
you have work for me?

11:09.370 --> 11:13.130
- Cosmic coincidence.
- When'd you build this?

11:13.210 --> 11:15.170
Daniel-san, watch.

11:31.980 --> 11:35.230
Come. Take off jacket.
You try.

11:36.980 --> 11:39.280
Must focus.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.700
Concentrate.

11:41.780 --> 11:44.490
Focus. Most important.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.160
- I can't, Mr. Miyagi, not today.
- Why?

11:50.250 --> 11:53.170
Because my whole life
is goin' out of focus, that's why.

11:53.210 --> 11:56.050
When you feel life out of focus...

11:56.130 --> 11:59.380
always return to basic oflife.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.130
What, praying?

12:02.180 --> 12:03.680
Breathing.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.100
No breathe, no life.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.530
Oy. Come try it.

12:30.580 --> 12:34.830
Out of mouth.
Breathe in through nose.

12:37.420 --> 12:40.050
Breathe out of mouth.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.180
Breathe in.

12:49.010 --> 12:51.520
Breathe out.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.520
Oy. Now how feel?

13:00.070 --> 13:02.110
Better. More focused.

13:02.190 --> 13:05.280
Good. Come back to work.

13:19.670 --> 13:22.800
- Hey, I did it.
- You focused, Daniel-san.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.430
Breathe in, breathe out.

13:27.260 --> 13:29.100
In...

13:29.140 --> 13:30.600
out.

13:50.910 --> 13:52.370
Very good work.

14:03.130 --> 14:05.420
Yeah. I'll be right there.

14:05.510 --> 14:08.590
- How feel?
- Much better, thanks.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.720
What am I building
out there, any way?

14:10.810 --> 14:12.350
Guest room.

14:12.430 --> 14:15.850
- You expecting company?
- Ah, refugee.

14:17.230 --> 14:21.190
Refugee? Oh, yeah?
That's great. From where?

14:22.190 --> 14:23.730
Fresno.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.870
Fresno?

14:32.910 --> 14:35.410
Miyagi talk to mother
last night too.

14:35.450 --> 14:38.580
- And she said I could stay here?
- Lflike.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.540
- I don't have to go to Fresno?
- If no want.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.090
Oh, man, you saved my life!

14:44.170 --> 14:47.170
Thanks!
Mr. Miyagi, thanks.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.340
Welcome.

14:50.430 --> 14:52.010
Oy. Iced tea.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.100
Oh, yeah.
Wait. Look.

14:54.180 --> 14:57.890
I made this for you. It's rosewood.
I thought it'd be nice to show 'em off.

14:59.060 --> 15:02.110
Daniel-san, thank you for gift...

15:02.190 --> 15:04.280
but why show off?

15:05.570 --> 15:08.320
It says something about you,
winnin' the Medal of Honor.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.990
It says you're brave.
I thought it'd be neat.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.540
This say you brave.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.620
This say you lucky.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.630
- Oh, Mr. Miyagi live here?
- Excuse me.

15:22.670 --> 15:24.380
- " Miyagi."
- Excuse me.

15:24.460 --> 15:27.880
Mr. Miyagi. Registered letter
for you, sir, from Okinawa.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.880
Okinawa?

15:29.930 --> 15:32.890
Yes, sir.
Would you sign here, please?

15:34.220 --> 15:36.350
This is some place you have here.

15:36.430 --> 15:39.440
From the outside yard,
you'd never know it.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.270
You should charge admission.

15:42.350 --> 15:44.980
My missus loves this stuff.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.690
You mind ifl bring her by
sometime to see it?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.410
Some other time, maybe.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.210
What is it?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.680
My father.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.390
He very sick.

16:18.560 --> 16:22.060
Your father? I didn't even
know he was still alive.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.030
How come you can get
a passport in one day?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.160
Have next-day plane ticket.

16:39.620 --> 16:42.870
You never told me, why'd you leave
Okinawa in the first place?

16:43.960 --> 16:46.420
Fall in love with girl.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.420
So? Why'd you leave?

16:49.510 --> 16:53.260
Was arranged by her parents
she marry someone else.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.560
- Did you ever meet the guy?
- Hai.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.890
What was he like?

17:00.980 --> 17:03.690
Was Miyagi best friend.

17:09.780 --> 17:13.069
So this is your old girlfriend, Yukie?
She sent the letter?

17:13.150 --> 17:15.780
- Hai.
- And this is your buddy.

17:16.740 --> 17:19.829
My best buddy, Sato.

17:19.910 --> 17:23.410
- You think he's still alive?
- We were same age.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.460
What did he do when
he found out about you two?

17:27.790 --> 17:30.460
Challenge Miyagi to fight.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.970
Must've been some girl.

17:34.050 --> 17:36.390
Oh, Miyagi remember.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.310
I make big speech...

17:39.390 --> 17:41.520
in front of whole village.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.020
Miyagi breakwith tradition...

17:44.060 --> 17:46.770
go against parent arrangement.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.570
Marry yukie anyway.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.910
Of course, Sato feel disgrace.

18:01.370 --> 18:05.330
So challenge Miyagi to fight
to save his honor.

18:06.790 --> 18:10.170
- And you lost?
- No.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.210
Never fight.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.170
Next day leave Okinawa forever.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.260
What about her?
Didn't you love her?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.060
Very much.

18:22.140 --> 18:24.600
- Well, did she love you?
- Hai.

18:24.680 --> 18:28.600
- So, then how could you leave?
- Miyagi no believe in fighting.

18:28.690 --> 18:32.270
I know that,
but you guys were in love. Come on.

18:34.690 --> 18:37.700
Never put passion before principle.

18:37.780 --> 18:40.530
Even if win, you lose.

18:46.830 --> 18:48.250
Think they got married?

18:48.330 --> 18:51.670
Sato, his family
was richest in village.

18:51.750 --> 18:55.210
Yukie's was poorest.
Was good arrangement.

18:56.840 --> 19:00.720
It was 45 years ago. He shouldn't
be angry about his honor anymore.

19:02.640 --> 19:06.310
In Okinawa,
honor have no time limit.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.520
You serious?

19:11.610 --> 19:15.780
In Okinawa, honor very serious.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.960
I guess I'd better get goin'.
I gotta go help my mom pack.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.340
I'll stop by tomorrow,
okay, Mr. Miyagi?

19:41.090 --> 19:43.010
Taxi leave 6:00 p.m.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.600
Yeah, I'll be here by then.

19:48.730 --> 19:52.730
Miyagi sorry things not work out.

19:52.810 --> 19:55.770
That's no problem.
I hope your dad's okay.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.370
You're cutting it
pretty close, mister.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.220
- Go airport.
- All right.

21:09.390 --> 21:11.890
Have a good flight.
Nice to see you.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.400
- Hello.
- Good evening.

21:15.900 --> 21:19.530
You will be in seat 32-B.

21:19.610 --> 21:22.030
- Enjoy the flight.
- Mr. Miyagi!

21:22.110 --> 21:24.910
Wait! I'm comin' with you!
My mother said it's okay.

21:24.990 --> 21:28.950
- I mean, if it's okay with you.
- Very expensive ticket.

21:29.030 --> 21:31.870
I got the money from my savings account.
It's all taken care of.

21:31.950 --> 21:34.710
Savings for college education.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.670
So I'll get a job when we get back
and I'll go six months late.

21:37.710 --> 21:39.920
It doesn't make a difference
when I go.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.260
- Jobs very hard to find.
- Yeah, I know.

21:43.340 --> 21:47.430
I mean, Mr. Miyagi,
you're more important than college.

21:47.510 --> 21:50.010
You're more important
than anything to me.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.600
When I need you,
you're always there for me.

21:52.680 --> 21:56.600
I really wanna go, and if it's
okay with you, I'd like to go.

21:58.020 --> 21:59.980
Daniel-san,
don't think good idea.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.650
It'll give me a chance
to study Okinawan history up close.

22:02.740 --> 22:05.950
- Come on.
- Never know you study that.

22:06.030 --> 22:07.530
I just started.

22:07.620 --> 22:11.490
- I'm closing the doors.
- Come on.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.370
- Please?
- Go back to the gate, young man.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.880
Young man coming with us.

22:20.750 --> 22:23.010
Mr. Miyagi, thank you.

22:23.090 --> 22:26.300
No, Daniel-san.
Thank you.

22:28.550 --> 22:32.260
- Hope you don't get airsick.
- What's airsick?

22:40.230 --> 22:43.780
You know the biggest U.S. air base
in the Pacific is on Okinawa?

22:47.820 --> 22:50.660
What's the name
of your village again?

22:50.700 --> 22:52.490
Tomi Village.

22:54.330 --> 22:55.960
I can't find it.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.750
Find Naha?

22:59.830 --> 23:02.170
Yeah, I know where Naha is.

23:02.210 --> 23:05.209
Go south, along the sea.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.590
Find Tomi Village.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.800
I keep runnin' into the air base.

23:12.510 --> 23:15.980
You look again morning.
MaybeTomi Village be there.

23:16.060 --> 23:17.810
Get some sleep.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.220
Was Sato as good as you in karate?

23:56.470 --> 23:58.430
Have same teacher.

24:00.100 --> 24:02.400
Your father?
He taught both of you?

24:04.190 --> 24:08.070
I thought you said your family's karate
was only taught from father to son.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.360
Miyagi ask father...

24:11.410 --> 24:13.950
make exception this case.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.250
If you fought Sato, you think
your father would have been referee?

24:27.670 --> 24:29.590
No referee.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.260
How do you know who wins?

24:35.760 --> 24:39.020
The one who dead doesn't.

25:16.850 --> 25:19.430
It's pretty weird having somebody
go through my stuff like that.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.810
Glad I didn't have
any dirty laundry.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.110
Was this place here
when you left?

25:26.190 --> 25:28.940
Miyagi leave Okinawa by boat.

25:29.020 --> 25:32.240
No airport Okinawa at that time.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.990
I kept lookin' through my book.
I still can't find your village.

25:35.070 --> 25:38.370
- How are we gonna find it?
- Ask taxi.

25:39.790 --> 25:42.500
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, isn't that him?

25:45.710 --> 25:47.630
Can you break a log like that?

25:49.000 --> 25:52.210
Don't know.
Never been attacked by tree.

26:07.690 --> 26:11.190
It is great honor.
I am Chozen Toguchi.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.320
Yukie-san say sorry
she could not meet you herself.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.450
We have a car waiting for you.

26:17.990 --> 26:18.990
Car?

26:20.740 --> 26:22.200
Please.

26:24.910 --> 26:27.540
You speakvery good English,
Toguchi-san.

26:27.630 --> 26:30.290
In Okinawa, it help to speak
very good English.

26:30.340 --> 26:34.090
Myfriend and student,
Daniel LaRusso.

26:34.170 --> 26:35.590
Thank you.

26:36.630 --> 26:38.930
- You karate student, huh?
- Yeah.

26:39.010 --> 26:41.350
- Welcome to Okinawa.
- Thanks.

26:41.430 --> 26:44.680
I hope your stay here
is a pleasant one.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.180
How you know I be here today?

27:26.310 --> 27:28.890
Okinawa very small place.

27:39.410 --> 27:40.820
Village south.

27:40.870 --> 27:44.290
Why, please, we go north now?

27:44.370 --> 27:47.080
Some things have changed
since you go, Miyagi-san.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.420
And some things have not, eh?

28:12.230 --> 28:13.810
Out!

28:26.330 --> 28:28.370
- What's goin' on?
- No talking!

28:35.290 --> 28:36.670
Uncle.

28:37.760 --> 28:38.880
Uncle!

28:55.980 --> 28:57.440
Sato.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.450
So, coward...

29:02.530 --> 29:04.450
you return.

29:05.370 --> 29:08.080
To settle affairs with Father.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.870
And with me.

29:11.790 --> 29:14.540
Sato, I no fight you.

29:16.540 --> 29:20.670
A coward!

29:26.470 --> 29:29.140
You see your father.

29:29.220 --> 29:30.930
Then you see me!

29:58.880 --> 30:01.550
- What are you gonna do?
- Find taxi.

30:01.630 --> 30:03.720
No. About Sato.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.050
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

30:06.140 --> 30:07.510
Nothing.

30:17.650 --> 30:20.980
All this because you had to go and tell
everybody you were gonna marry yukie?

30:22.440 --> 30:25.860
Why didn't you just marry her
and move to Alaska?

30:25.950 --> 30:28.700
Daniel-san, nobody perfect.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.550
- Where you goin', buddy?
- Tomi Village.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.970
Tomi Village?
Never heard of it.

30:50.010 --> 30:52.140
This is Kadena Air Base.

30:52.220 --> 30:54.180
Sarge, Tomi Village?

30:54.270 --> 30:57.730
You're standing on it, Corporal!
Get 'em outta here!

30:57.810 --> 30:59.730
Just take that road
and make a right.

31:05.490 --> 31:10.120
Miyagi remember first time
father teach fishing...

31:10.200 --> 31:12.790
right off this point.

31:12.870 --> 31:15.540
Was 1 927.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.420
Was much quieter then.

31:52.370 --> 31:54.030
Thanks a lot.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.140
Take off shoes.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.650
Auntie Yukie said you would come.

32:28.690 --> 32:31.360
Yukie... Where is she?

32:32.820 --> 32:34.950
Nursing yourfather.

32:37.330 --> 32:40.580
- I'm Daniel.
- I am Kumiko.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.540
- Please.
- Thank you.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.850
He sleeping.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.820
How you know where to find me?

34:00.620 --> 34:02.830
Have known for many years.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.710
Why you never write sooner?

34:09.590 --> 34:11.760
Out of respect.

34:14.590 --> 34:16.510
For husband.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.429
For your silence.

34:22.889 --> 34:25.440
I never marry.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.920
What did he say?

34:50.420 --> 34:54.219
" If I am dreaming,
let me never awake.

34:55.420 --> 34:59.390
Ifl am awake,
let me never sleep."

35:49.940 --> 35:51.560
Good morning.

35:53.650 --> 35:55.400
You're Yukie.

35:55.480 --> 35:58.110
- You Daniel-san.
- Yes.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.110
Mr. Miyagi's told me
a lot about you.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.540
And he tell me lot about you.

36:04.620 --> 36:07.830
- There's not that much to tell.
- Oh, no, no.

36:07.870 --> 36:10.670
He very...

36:10.710 --> 36:12.420
proud of you.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.840
How's his father feeling?

36:19.090 --> 36:21.590
Very tired.

36:23.470 --> 36:25.600
Miyagi Sensei in dojo.

36:26.970 --> 36:29.850
Thank you.
See you later.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.840
Oh, good morning, Daniel-san.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.500
Good morning.

36:56.590 --> 36:59.510
Welcome to Miyagi family dojo.
You like?

36:59.590 --> 37:01.630
It's great.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.010
This is really somethin'.
Who are all these guys?

37:04.050 --> 37:05.720
All Miyagi ancestor.

37:05.810 --> 37:08.930
Four hundred year worth.

37:08.970 --> 37:10.980
And who's that?

37:11.060 --> 37:14.480
That is Miyagi Shimpo Sensei.

37:14.520 --> 37:17.780
First Miyagi
bring karate to Okinawa.

37:17.820 --> 37:21.610
- The one who went to China.
- Hai. 1 625.

37:21.650 --> 37:24.910
- How did he get there? By boat?
- By accident.

37:24.950 --> 37:28.990
Like all Miyagi,
Shimpo Sensei was fisherman.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.540
Love fishing.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.290
Love saki.

37:32.370 --> 37:36.130
One day, strong wind, strong sun...

37:36.210 --> 37:39.840
strong saki, but no fish.

37:39.920 --> 37:43.840
Shimpo Sensei fall asleep
off coast ofOkinawa...

37:43.880 --> 37:46.640
wake up off coast ofChina.

37:46.720 --> 37:51.350
Ten year later, he come back
with Chinese wife and two kids...

37:51.430 --> 37:53.890
and secret...

37:53.940 --> 37:56.360
of Miyagi family karate.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.730
This is the secret
of your family's karate?

38:02.280 --> 38:05.160
- I don't get it.
- Practice. You will.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.160
Come. We go work.

38:08.030 --> 38:10.290
What are these things?

38:10.370 --> 38:12.960
These rules to karate.

38:13.040 --> 38:17.840
" Karate for defense only."

38:20.880 --> 38:22.880
Rule number two:

38:22.970 --> 38:25.720
" First learn rule number one."

38:46.820 --> 38:48.410
Yeah, coming.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.830
This looks like a town
that time forgot.

39:03.340 --> 39:08.180
I thinkwe went school together.
I'd introduce you, but I forget name.

39:10.300 --> 39:13.140
How come if this is a fishing village,
I don't see anybody fishing?

39:13.180 --> 39:15.140
Yukie-san tell me...

39:15.230 --> 39:19.650
after war, Sato father
bring in commercial fishing boat.

39:19.730 --> 39:24.740
Inside two year, all fish gone.
All small boat gone.

39:24.780 --> 39:30.240
Almost everything gone,
except old cannery...

39:30.320 --> 39:32.990
and lots of memories.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.040
Ah, lchiro.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.330
When I left, he was same place...

39:37.370 --> 39:41.790
doing same thing,
playing same tune.

39:47.380 --> 39:51.220
- That's a shrine, right?
- Hai. Shinto shrine.

39:52.970 --> 39:55.640
It must be tough times
with all the fish gone, huh?

39:55.680 --> 39:57.810
Very tough.

39:57.890 --> 40:01.610
Most people leavevillage for city,
look for work.

40:01.690 --> 40:05.110
My father, some others,
invent whole new economy.

40:05.190 --> 40:08.650
Go into vegetable business,
save what was left ofvillage.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.660
Everyone owns
their own little farm?

40:10.740 --> 40:13.740
No. Sato own. Village rent.

40:13.780 --> 40:15.790
- That's a bummer.
- You're right.

40:15.870 --> 40:18.410
Familiar face.

40:18.460 --> 40:22.080
After school, Kumiko teach
O-bon dance to kids.

40:36.100 --> 40:40.899
O-bon dance. It's for the festival
in honor of the dead, right?

40:40.900 --> 40:42.350
Very good!

40:42.440 --> 40:44.900
I remember reading about it last night.

40:44.940 --> 40:49.070
What is that, a pillbox?
Probably left over from World War ll.

40:49.150 --> 40:53.450
It must have been terrible here.
1 5,000 Americans killed in ten days.

40:53.530 --> 40:58.080
Yeah. And 1 50,000 Okinawan
and Japanese.

40:58.160 --> 41:01.170
Why we all so stupid?

41:34.240 --> 41:36.410
You have seen Father?

41:37.910 --> 41:40.120
Then we finish tonight.

41:41.710 --> 41:44.290
I bring a nephew for witness.

41:44.330 --> 41:48.960
Then you and nephew both
lose sleep tonight. I not be there.

41:49.050 --> 41:50.970
Your teacher coward!

41:54.970 --> 41:57.050
You leave me no choice.

42:10.730 --> 42:12.400
Wait a second.

42:18.330 --> 42:19.700
Your father.

42:19.790 --> 42:22.460
He want you.

42:23.410 --> 42:25.460
And you, too.

43:25.640 --> 43:29.480
Out of respect for my teacher...

43:29.560 --> 43:32.860
I give you three days to mourn.

43:36.700 --> 43:41.410
When finish, I come back.

43:41.490 --> 43:45.040
You prepare to join him.

46:10.220 --> 46:14.560
You know, when my father died...

46:14.650 --> 46:18.770
I spent a lot of time
thinking I wasn't such a great son.

46:20.940 --> 46:24.490
Like maybe
I could have listened more...

46:26.070 --> 46:29.120
spent more time
with him together.

46:32.830 --> 46:35.210
I felt so guilty...

46:35.250 --> 46:40.090
Iike he did everything for me
and I didn't do anything for him.

46:48.930 --> 46:54.140
Then one day I realized, I did the
greatest thing for him before he died.

46:56.690 --> 46:59.610
I was there with him...

46:59.650 --> 47:02.400
and I held his hand...

47:02.440 --> 47:04.610
and I said good-bye.

47:56.870 --> 48:00.130
Very good, Daniel-san.
Time for next lesson.

48:01.340 --> 48:02.800
All right!

48:07.220 --> 48:09.180
I don't get something.

48:09.220 --> 48:13.430
If Sato hates you so much,
why does he give you time to mourn?

48:13.510 --> 48:15.430
My father was his teacher.

48:15.520 --> 48:18.310
Inside the heart,
Sato still know right from wrong.

48:18.390 --> 48:20.310
He still wants to kill you.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.440
Sometime what heart know,
head forget.

48:22.520 --> 48:24.900
But the guy's looking to go to war.
I don't understand.

48:24.980 --> 48:27.440
Never stop war
by taking part in one.

48:27.530 --> 48:30.130
I know. But what if he threw that punch?
What would you have done?

48:30.160 --> 48:33.240
- Block.
- Think you could have?

48:33.330 --> 48:36.370
- Even you could have.
- I'm not that strong.

48:36.450 --> 48:40.250
Not matter who's stronger.
Matter who's smarter.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.670
I guess that's why
I won the tournament.

48:44.750 --> 48:46.710
Good guess, Daniel-san.

48:51.800 --> 48:56.390
From very first karate lesson,
Miyagi father always say...

48:56.470 --> 48:59.690
" Best way to avoid punch,
no be there."

48:59.770 --> 49:04.400
- I don't get it.
- Miyagi say same until I work here.

49:04.480 --> 49:08.110
Miyagi first job,
work for Sato father.

49:11.070 --> 49:16.290
One day, Miyagi mind on something
other than fish when empty net return.

49:21.330 --> 49:23.210
That was close!

49:23.290 --> 49:26.380
Drum technique. Understand?

49:26.460 --> 49:27.630
Yeah!

49:27.710 --> 49:29.590
Drum technique.

49:29.670 --> 49:31.800
Let me try.

49:33.260 --> 49:35.260
Come on. Just one turn, please.

49:35.300 --> 49:38.390
You gotta. Just one turn.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.600
Please?

49:43.690 --> 49:45.730
Okay, come platform.

49:45.820 --> 49:48.980
- Great.
- I go pull up hook.

49:52.740 --> 49:57.540
Father say use drum technique
only as last resort.

49:57.580 --> 49:59.200
You ready?

49:59.290 --> 50:00.620
I'm ready.

50:02.870 --> 50:06.630
Remember, best block, no be there.

50:06.710 --> 50:07.750
One...

50:07.840 --> 50:08.840
two...

50:08.880 --> 50:09.920
three!

50:15.550 --> 50:17.300
You all right?

50:17.390 --> 50:19.350
Yeah, I'm okay.

50:19.390 --> 50:23.520
Come. Enough for today.
Try again tomorrow.

50:31.190 --> 50:36.320
You know, Miyagi and Yukie
have first date here.

50:36.410 --> 50:39.990
Remember like was yesterday.

50:41.250 --> 50:44.370
Happen over load of fresh mackerel.

50:59.140 --> 51:01.020
You all right?

51:01.060 --> 51:04.140
Yeah. I'm sorry.
That was pretty stupid.

51:09.230 --> 51:12.490
Miyagi say that to father
when same thing happened.

51:12.570 --> 51:16.200
Father agree it was stupid.
Father was right.

51:17.110 --> 51:19.580
Is there a counterpunch
in the technique?

51:22.750 --> 51:24.210
Ask drum.

51:41.850 --> 51:44.810
Come, Daniel-san,
talk to drum later.

51:58.950 --> 52:02.240
- Does that guy's uncle own everything?
- Almost.

52:02.330 --> 52:05.700
Hey! There's Miyagi the coward.

52:05.790 --> 52:07.670
And his baby!

52:07.750 --> 52:10.790
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Why should it?

52:10.880 --> 52:13.380
People might believe it's true.

52:13.460 --> 52:18.260
Daniel-san, lie become truth
only if person want to believe it.

52:19.510 --> 52:21.930
Is that another
old Okinawan saying?

52:21.970 --> 52:24.470
No. New Okinawan saying.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.230
How new?

52:27.310 --> 52:29.270
About ten seconds.

52:34.610 --> 52:36.110
Are you okay?

52:36.190 --> 52:38.900
I'll get it for you.

52:38.990 --> 52:40.450
Carrots, right?

52:48.750 --> 52:50.040
I'll get it.

53:03.100 --> 53:05.850
Your little teacher
should get hearing aid.

53:05.930 --> 53:09.480
- Maybe you need one, too.
- I only hear what's worth listening to.

53:10.810 --> 53:13.900
Look out! We're working here.

53:13.980 --> 53:15.900
What is this?

53:19.900 --> 53:21.990
So, you cheat people!

53:22.070 --> 53:24.990
Shame! You cheat! You cheat!

53:25.080 --> 53:28.000
We'll talk sometime
when you're not so busy.

53:37.300 --> 53:40.720
You still remember our song?

53:42.380 --> 53:44.430
Sing for me.

53:46.010 --> 53:48.970
Yukie, I no sing long time.

53:49.060 --> 53:51.850
Please. Please.

54:04.780 --> 54:08.540
Oh, we were so young then.

54:08.620 --> 54:13.000
Yukie, why you never marry?

54:13.040 --> 54:15.290
You never come back.

54:16.340 --> 54:18.670
You knew I would not.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.220
Yes, I knew.

54:25.260 --> 54:28.060
My father...

54:28.140 --> 54:33.890
he ever tell you about
how he feel when I leave?

54:37.110 --> 54:38.570
One time.

54:40.190 --> 54:46.120
He say he love you very much...

54:46.200 --> 54:47.910
and...

54:50.240 --> 54:52.910
what you did was right.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.510
Except for one thing.

55:05.220 --> 55:08.100
I should have taken you with me.

55:39.500 --> 55:40.590
Hello.

55:42.880 --> 55:45.930
- I am disturbing you?
- What? No, not at all.

55:46.010 --> 55:47.970
What are you doing?

55:48.050 --> 55:51.470
- I was practicing some moves. See?
- What are moves?

55:51.560 --> 55:55.810
It's like karate.
I'm trying to figure this thing out.

55:55.890 --> 55:57.810
Looks like O-bon dance.

55:57.850 --> 56:00.520
Then I must be doing
something wrong.

56:01.610 --> 56:03.780
Doing something right. Look.

56:25.210 --> 56:28.300
- Wow. Where'd you learn that?
- From my auntie.

56:28.380 --> 56:29.930
That's terrific.

56:30.850 --> 56:32.890
You try.

56:32.970 --> 56:36.180
No, not me. I was absent
the day they taught graceful.

56:36.270 --> 56:38.310
You were what?

56:38.390 --> 56:40.520
Forget it, it's a bad joke.

56:40.600 --> 56:42.150
I'll try it.

56:42.230 --> 56:43.690
Good.

56:50.910 --> 56:52.530
Wait a sec.

56:55.790 --> 56:56.790
Right...

56:56.830 --> 56:58.910
and left.

57:16.350 --> 57:17.930
We're a hit.

57:19.520 --> 57:22.310
Maybe we could
take it on the road.

57:22.350 --> 57:25.610
But we are on the road.

57:25.690 --> 57:28.110
You dance very nice.

57:28.150 --> 57:30.570
Like geisha.

57:30.610 --> 57:32.200
Let's go.

57:32.280 --> 57:35.830
His little teacher's favorite
technique, huh? " Let's go."

57:37.410 --> 57:39.620
Hey, come on, give me
the drum back, please.

57:39.710 --> 57:41.620
You mean the baby rattle?

57:41.710 --> 57:44.500
Why don't baby come take it back?

57:46.460 --> 57:47.920
Stop!

57:49.380 --> 57:52.010
Are you okay?

57:52.090 --> 57:56.140
You insult my honor again...

57:56.220 --> 57:57.970
and I kill you.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.580
You keep for your collection.

58:18.660 --> 58:21.500
I know you like it.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.880
Are you all right?

58:30.970 --> 58:33.380
Yeah, I'm okay.

58:40.350 --> 58:45.350
He cheats these people, and I'm
insulting his honor. I don't get it.

58:45.440 --> 58:47.360
He has no idea what honor is.

58:47.440 --> 58:50.110
I kinda got that feeling.

58:50.190 --> 58:54.070
Ever since we were children,
he has always been the same.

58:54.160 --> 58:58.120
This is the first time I had somebody
ever tell me they're gonna kill me.

58:58.200 --> 59:00.740
This is ridiculous.
I gotta talk to him.

59:00.830 --> 59:05.120
He would only take it as a sign
of weakness and try to hurt you again.

59:05.210 --> 59:07.170
You got any ideas?

59:08.210 --> 59:09.670
Avoid him.

59:11.460 --> 59:13.670
I think I'm on the wrong island.

59:17.930 --> 59:19.840
What's going on here?

59:19.890 --> 59:21.800
Tea ceremony.

59:21.850 --> 59:24.560
I guess it's an old ritual.

59:28.650 --> 59:32.070
It means that they
are falling in love again.

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:19.530
- Daniel-san!
- I've been looking for you.

01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:22.030
Been here trying
to fix refrigerator.

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:24.280
What's wrong with it?

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:28.200
This. Gotta go Naha City
for new part.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.750
You like come?

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:34.380
I was supposed to go sightseeing
with Kumiko, but I could go.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.920
- You go, have good time.
- We could go tomorrow.

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:39.970
- No, I see you later.
- We don't have plans.

01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.970
Never keep lady waiting.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.640
I'll remember that.
I'll see you later.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.440
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.710
Be careful.

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:15.340
This reminds me of the Palisades.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.380
Palisades? Where's that?

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.670
It's in New Jersey,
where I used to live.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.090
Is it pretty?

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:25.220
Some of it.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.560
There it is! The ruins
of the castle of King Shohashi.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.350
The Peace King.

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:35.270
- You know King Shohashi?
- Not personally.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.730
Name of it is...

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.610
Now Sato owns it.

01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:44.450
In old days, O-bon dance
was held here, but no more.

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:47.030
Now every piece goes away.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.289
Sato, he sells it to museums.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.250
Sounds like him.

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:58.710
Legend is, if you race up to the castle
and win, your wish will come true.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.420
Yeah? I'll give you a head start.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:03.680
Not necessary, thank you.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.640
Excuse me.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.720
Ready, set, go!

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.120
- I won!
- You cheated!

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.200
And you know you did.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.250
We'll share the wish.

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:36.210
Close your eyes.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:56.690
Know what I wanna know? What do you
wanna do with your life, your dreams?

01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:59.060
Okay, I'll show you my dream.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:02.570
I still can't get used to people driving
on the wrong side of the street.

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:05.740
- What side do you drive on?
- On the right side.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.410
- I didn't know that.
- Everybody drives on the right side.

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:12.370
- Not everybody.
- That's what I'm learning.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:22.000
You want to sell TVs for a living?

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:25.970
What? Interested in electronics?
I don't understand.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.890
There.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.640
That is my dream.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.850
- You want to be a dancer!
- Very much.

01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:37.730
That's a great thing to be.

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:39.850
Where do you study?

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.940
No schools for this kind of dancing
in Okinawa.

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:45.570
What a drag!

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:50.240
Come to the dance tonight.
Oh, bring your friend.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.700
- Okay.
- Good. See you there.

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:57.250
- Like to go to dance?
- Sure. That's Sato's dojo.

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:02.590
I want to check that out.
Come on.

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:05.050
Not inside.
Chozen teaches in there.

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:10.550
I'm not going inside. I just wanna look
through the window. He won't see me.

01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:13.430
He teach American military police
in there.

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:14.930
Really?

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:29.780
He's not bad.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.990
He is Sato's number-one student.

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:33.660
I can see why.

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.950
We must go.
He may see you.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.550
Maybe we'll run into
Mr. Miyagi here.

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:49.630
Oh? Why would he be here?

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.340
He said he had to come into town
to get a part for his refrigerator.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:56.600
Oh! I know that store.
It's at the corner.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.520
- Maybe we will see him.
- Good!

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:04.690
What's going on in here?

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:07.650
This bad place.
We don't want to go in here.

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:10.490
Let's check it out.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.180
Come on, baby,
give me the money.

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:36.850
I've got 45 here.
Come on, baby.

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:42.560
Show me you can do it.
Show me you can do it.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.060
Yeah! I got 40!

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.070
The guy's standing wrong.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:50.820
- See? I told you. You must use your hip.
- But he looks so strong.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:54.280
No, you gotta be strong here, not here.
It doesn't make a difference.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.830
You think you can do better,
big mouth?

01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:59.870
You think you can do better?

01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:02.910
- I don't know.
- Let's find out, huh?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.250
- Maybe some other time.
- There is no other time!

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:10.510
Whatever problems Mr. Miyagi has with
your uncle, they don't have to be ours.

01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:13.880
No. We have our own, huh?

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:18.300
- Kumiko, where are you going?
- You go nowhere!

01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:21.100
Call my uncle.
You will take bets.

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:25.100
Yosh! I give three to one, eh?

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.940
No, no, I'm not doing it!

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:33.700
Broken ice or broken neck.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.950
He's got to break all three, right?

01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:39.410
Wrong! All six!

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:43.250
All the bets in.

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:46.710
Not all bets. Not yet.

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:50.130
Boy, am I glad to see you!

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:52.880
No worry, nothing.
Miyagi fix everything.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.380
What odds?

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:57.090
Three to one he does not make
through ice.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.970
- How many pieces?
- Six.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:02.390
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:06.140
$600 say he break all six.

01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:07.440
600 bucks?

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.440
- I cannot cover that.
- You are covered.

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.660
Now we have bet.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.200
All right! Give me your money.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.410
Hey, I can't believe this.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.870
I won't be able to break that.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:30.670
He tried twice and only got through two.
What do you expect me to do?

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:32.130
Focus.

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:34.050
Great, and what are you gonna do?

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:35.720

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.300
You got it. All bets are in.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:39.069
We do not honor bet with coward.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.700
Do not embarrass uncle again.

01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:52.330
Thank you, Sato.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.090
Pleasure do business with you.

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:03.220
You knew it all along, didn't you?
You didn't have a doubt in your mind.

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.810
- No doubt.
- Howwill we spend it? What will we get?

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:11.100
You get college tuition.
We get Chinese food. Come.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:30.080
I thought you have date.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.420
Yeah. I was waiting for Kumiko.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.080
I wish you had one of these back home.
This place is terrific.

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.670
No use weapon for duster.

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:41.720
This old rag?

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.300
Drop old rag.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.470
- Why?
- Drop.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.479
- What I see?
- I don't...

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.730
- Primary target.
- Primary target. A little close.

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:00.440
This is foryou.

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:12.160

01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:18.290
My uncle say your
three days mourning over.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.760
I have been sent to get you.

01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:25.430
Tell uncle I am farmer,
not fighter.

01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:57.960
Sensei, a visitor to see you.

01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:15.140
Is that same wood
we find together on beach?

01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:17.690
Same. What you want?

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:21.270
Come make peace between us.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.860
You forget. You betray me.

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:27.200
I was only 1 8 years old.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.910
And responsible for own action.

01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:32.200
It explain why I leave.

01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:34.870
Fear is why you leave.

01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:37.960
Sato, I beg you.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.380
Your fear make air stink.

01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:47.880
What has happened to you?

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:24.210
Isn't this great?

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.210
Yeah, it's nice.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.510
Are you still worried about
what happened this afternoon?

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:34.600
I came here to help Mr. Miyagi.
And all this stuff, I feel so helpless.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.430
Nothing you can do.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.930
I guess.

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:39.940
Can you dance like this?

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:41.520
I can try.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.980
- One, two, three, four. Got it?
- I think so.

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:37.700
Hey, you're very good.

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:41.290
You tease me.
You're a great dancer.

01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:46.130
Wanna get something to drink?
Sit down?

01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:48.250
Where did you learn
to dance like that?

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:51.170
I've been my mom's practice partner
foryears.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.510
She must be a good teacher.

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:55.680
Yeah, she's great.
Have a seat.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.970
- Okay, thanks.
- Oh, man.

01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:04.600
- You feeling better now?
- Much better, thanks.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.440
That's good.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.820
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:15.870
Sure.

01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:17.660
It's, you know...

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.750
it's kind of personal, though.

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:28.380
Are you...

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:31.800
Are you arranged like, you know?

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.630
Arranged?

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.510
To marry somebody?

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:41.140
Oh! No. That's an old custom.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.600
Whoever I marry is up to me.

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:46.770
Well, that's good.

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.400
Are you arranged?

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.530
What, are you kiddin'?
I'm a free agent.

01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:55.490
What is free agent?

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:58.160
That just means that I'm available.

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:01.740
That's good.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.460
Yeah.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.130
Oh, no, not again.
I'm not lookin' for any trouble.

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.140
Maybe trouble looking foryou.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:20.050
What do you want from me?

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.060
My money back.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.480
Come on, man,
that's all my money.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.940
No. All my money.

01:15:39.570 --> 01:15:44.330
Don't worry about your little friend.
We take her home.

01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:59.550
Thank you.

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.760
Come on!

01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:06.600
Comin' through! Look out.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.940
Sorry.

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.610
You got the keys?

01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:02.200
Miyagi, come out.

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:09.370
We fight now!

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.870
What are you guys doin' here?

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.080
Where Miyagi?

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.620
I don't know.

01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:58.840
Leave him message for me.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.720
With pleasure.

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:08.680
Come here.
I want to show you something.

01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:50.680
Your sensei teach you
how to fight with spear?

01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.270
Too bad.

01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:03.110
Maybe he teach you
how to be coward.

01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:05.860
Hey, Mr. Coward.

01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:19.460
Leave message.

01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:37.020
This your teacher's fault.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:41.190
If he were man with honor,
you would live.

01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:43.360
But he's not.

01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:59.540
Enough!

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:04.550
Uncle problem with Miyagi,
not with boy.

01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:08.930
No, you have problem, old man,
with me.

01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:03.900
Act of coward!

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.610
Daniel-san, you okay?

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:13.160
He was really gonna kill me.

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.120
Come.

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.290
Miyagi make tea.
Make you feel better.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.340
Tomorrow we go home.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.720
I did not want for us
to end this way again.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.430
I would stay if could.

01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:22.140
I know.

01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:49.380
Yukie, what can I do
to ease your pain?

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.850
Take me with you.

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:25.790
Whatcha doin'?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.670
Old custom.

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:33.840
When fishermen
would go out to sea...

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:37.890
families would offer
rice to the gods.

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:41.260
For a good catch?

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.350
For a quick return.

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.990
Thought any more
about dance school?

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:00.490
I told you.
No schools for that here.

01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:02.990
Well, there are in the States.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.120
My home is here.

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:11.590
Home is where you hang your hat.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.510
You think I would like America?

01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:20.010
I think you would love it.

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:25.560
Do you think it would love me?

01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:31.020
I know one part of it
that already does.

01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:41.030
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go see.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.030
Okay, come on.

01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:14.110
What are you doing?

01:25:14.190 --> 01:25:16.280
I sell land.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.690
Why?

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.740
Why do you think?

01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.740
You will destroy village?

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:24.370
No, you will!

01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:38.010
You win.

01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.430
I fight you.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.430
One condition.

01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:48.890
No matter whowin...

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:52.810
title to land
pass tovillage forever.

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:55.730
You ask fortoo much.

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:59.320
Small price to pay
foryour honor.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.950
You're right. Small price.

01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:08.950
I see you here midnight.

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:21.800
Miyagi, I wait long time forthis.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.470
No tricks tonight.

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:28.640
Ortomorrow everything gone!

01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:33.690
Their homes, their church...

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:36.270
everything gone!

01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:54.210
What's this?

01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:56.540
Last will and testament.

01:26:56.630 --> 01:27:02.260
Yukie get house here.
You get house and pickup back home.

01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:05.220
I don't want the house
and the pickup. I want you.

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.510
Can't we call this off?
Why don't we just leave?

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.020
Impossible, Daniel-san.

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:17.020
Just forget about
the honor garbage.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:21.360
Have nothing to do
with honor garbage.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:24.320
This have to do
with village survival.

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.160
This isn't three points and you're out.
If you lose, I know what happens.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:32.450
Miyagi already win.

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:36.830
No matter what happen,
village safe forever.

01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:09.220
So, is this seat taken?

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:17.930
I'm sorry.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.660
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:25.080
- Quickly. There's danger. We must go.
- Why? I don't understand.

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:28.540
Big storm. Be here soon.
Not safe here.

01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:31.170
- Where are we going now?
- Back to village.

01:33:17.010 --> 01:33:19.930
Mr. Miyagi, wait up!

01:33:20.010 --> 01:33:22.800
Do you believe all this wind?
This is wild.

01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:24.470
And it get wilder.

01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:40.910
Are those people out there?

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.700
Come. We go help.

01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:57.630
Stay there!
We coming! Stay there!

01:33:57.710 --> 01:33:59.840
They need our help.

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.180
Are you all right?
You okay?

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:04.260
I got baby.

01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:06.310
I got the boy.

01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:09.180
Come on. Hang on. Hold on.

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.820
- Oh, no!
- Sato's in there!

01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:19.150
Here. Take baby.

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:22.280
I go find Sato. Go!

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.200
- Kumiko, take him.
- Be careful. Let's go.

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.050
Where uncle?

01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:43.680
He's dead.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.100
Come! Must work fast!

01:35:00.490 --> 01:35:03.950
Miyagi! Now you come to fight!

01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:05.410
Coward!

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:09.370
Now when I am helpless!

01:35:09.450 --> 01:35:10.870
It won't move!

01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:13.870
You are lower than the storm!

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.130
Now whole village see.

01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:19.800
This is only way you can win.

01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:34.730
Come, Daniel-san.
Easy, Sato.

01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:36.230
Easy.

01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:38.230
I got you, old friend.

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.650
You'll be okay now.

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:59.590
Come get me!

01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:01.090
Come get me!

01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:03.840
You take Mr. Sato back!
I'll get the girl!

01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:10.640
Just hang on!

01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:13.930
Don't let go.

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.020
Uncle! Uncle!
I thought you were dead!

01:36:19.110 --> 01:36:21.150
I thought you were dead.

01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:22.650
Go help!

01:36:25.650 --> 01:36:27.320
Help him!

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:36.160
I cannot help him.
I cannot.

01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:57.350
Hang on! Just hang on!
Hold tight!

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.540
Hold on!

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.250
Just hang on!
Give me your arm!

01:37:27.970 --> 01:37:29.550
Hold on tight!

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:39.060
You're gonna be okay.
Hang on.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.450
Miyagi, let me go.

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:02.420
You'll be okay.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.300
Thanks a lot.

01:38:24.650 --> 01:38:27.320
Now, to you...

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.070
I am dead.

01:38:59.770 --> 01:39:01.890
How are they gonna
recover from this?

01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.520
All the seeds are gone.
The place is wrecked.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.270
- What are they gonna do now?
- Best they can.

01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:12.820
What is all this?
What's Sato doing here?

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:14.530
Don't know.

01:39:28.130 --> 01:39:29.840
I come help rebuild.

01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:33.170
Here deed to village.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:37.350
Forgive me. I beg you.

01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:43.230
Oh, Sato.
Nothing to forgive.

01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:46.270
Now's a good time to ask him.

01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:48.520
It's not my place.

01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:54.530
Mr. Sato, O-bon dance is soon...

01:39:54.610 --> 01:39:58.370
and it'll be hard the way things are
to have it here in the village.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.240
What you ask of me?

01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:05.330
Well, can they have it in the castle?
That's where it belongs, isn't it?

01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:12.550
Your student become my teacher.

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:17.140
O-bon will be held in castle.

01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:19.720
Now and forever!

01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:22.850
One condition.

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.350
You dance with us.

01:40:27.810 --> 01:40:29.560
You got it.

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:41.450
When you put your mind to it,
anything can happen.

01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:43.200
You're right.

01:42:06.490 --> 01:42:09.160
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be makin' a lot ofmistakes.

01:42:09.210 --> 01:42:11.750
Ifnot for you, I not be here.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:20.340
Now remember,
you have nothing to worry about.

01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:22.800
I'm not worried.
I think I'm scared.

01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:24.930
You kiddin'?
I've seen you do it.

01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:28.520
You're gonna be terrific.
It's true.

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:31.690
- Did I tell you you look beautiful?
- No.

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.690
Well, you do.

01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:49.620
I've seen her practice.
She's really amazing.

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.930
Behind you!

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:56.980
Get back!

01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:59.110
- Get back or I'll kill her!
- Chozen!

01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.610
Don't do this.

01:44:01.690 --> 01:44:03.820
I was wrong.

01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:05.450
Hate is wrong.

01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:08.530
- Lt's over.
- I cannot hear you, Uncle.

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:11.080
I am dead to you, remember?

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.290
Chozen, you are your uncle's
finest student.

01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:16.750
No disgrace him here.

01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:19.130
Your student disgrace me.

01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:21.460
I have been dishonored
all because of him.

01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:23.380
For whatever happened,
I apologize.

01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:26.180
Apology will not
give me back my honor!

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.970
- Neither will this.
- In their eyes it will.

01:44:29.010 --> 01:44:32.390
No more talk.
You cross bridge, or I kill her!

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:41.650
This not tournament.
This for real.

01:44:57.830 --> 01:45:00.340
Oy. No bridge.

01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:31.370
Now I dropped the bridge.
Let her go.

01:45:32.410 --> 01:45:35.750
- Come on!
- Now we fight to death!

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:49.110
Step back, Daniel-san!
Step back!

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.420
Live or die, man?

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:35.300
Die.

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.720
Wrong. Honk!
