00:01.773 --> 00:03.968
Family, I have an announcement.

00:04.133 --> 00:06.886
<i>Listen,
Playboy is doing a pictorial...</i>

00:07.053 --> 00:09.806
...on the prettiest weather girls
from coast to coast.

00:09.973 --> 00:13.602
They're gonna call it "Warm Fronts."

00:18.133 --> 00:20.283
And they want me to be in it.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.205
Absolutely not.

00:22.373 --> 00:25.092
But don't you even wanna hear
what I have to say about it?

00:25.253 --> 00:27.562
You heard our father: No!

00:28.453 --> 00:30.045
Carlton, what do you care?

00:30.213 --> 00:33.205
Look, I will not be publicly
embarrassed by a potential scandal.

00:33.373 --> 00:36.683
Now, now, don't get
your Underoos in a knot, stumpy.

00:38.653 --> 00:40.052
Hilary knows what she's doing.

00:40.213 --> 00:44.491
- Wait a minute, I haven't even decided...
- Quiet, Hilary. Work with me here, Hil.

00:45.093 --> 00:46.685
I can see it now:

00:46.853 --> 00:49.492
Long afternoons kicking back
on a chaise longue...

00:49.653 --> 00:53.362
...watching full-body contact
volleyball up at Hef's place.

00:54.213 --> 00:59.446
Hilary, as long as you live in my house,
you will abide by my rules.

00:59.613 --> 01:03.162
- And that goes for the rest of you.
- That's telling us, Dad.

01:03.973 --> 01:05.372
Wait.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.764
I am 24 years old,
and I can make my own decisions.

01:08.933 --> 01:10.002
Besides...

01:10.173 --> 01:12.050
...Mom said it was okay.

01:12.213 --> 01:13.646
Oh, yeah?

01:13.813 --> 01:14.962
Vivian!

01:15.133 --> 01:18.170
<i>So you said your daughter
could pose in Playboy, huh?</i>

01:18.333 --> 01:20.528
No. I said I didn't like the idea.

01:20.693 --> 01:24.003
But I also said she's a grown woman,
and it's her choice.

01:24.333 --> 01:29.407
No daughter of mine is posing
in that kind of magazine, period.

01:29.573 --> 01:31.882
You do this to me all the time, Daddy.

01:32.053 --> 01:34.442
I have a mind of my own,
and opinions...

01:34.613 --> 01:37.286
...and you never let me
express them and...

01:38.493 --> 01:40.563
What were we talking about?

01:44.213 --> 01:47.011
Hil, I think you were in the process
of storming out of here.

01:47.173 --> 01:48.970
Thanks, Will.

03:03.733 --> 03:05.007
So, what do you think?

03:05.893 --> 03:09.010
Look like you got hat-jacked
by Woody Woodpecker.

03:12.173 --> 03:15.245
These are the new booster hats.
Help me set up a display.

03:15.413 --> 03:17.244
Sure thing, boss lady.

03:18.373 --> 03:21.251
Oh, Jackie, check it out.
Hypothetical situation:

03:21.413 --> 03:25.292
Let's just say, like, a famous
men's magazine asked you to pose...

03:25.453 --> 03:28.650
...with nothing but that stupid hat on.
Would you do it?

03:28.813 --> 03:32.044
No way, I don't want
just anybody looking at this body.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.363
Has it changed since
we used to play doctor?

03:34.533 --> 03:36.808
- Stop it.
- See, you have beautiful teeth.

03:36.973 --> 03:39.203
I didn't even know you had those.
That was fun.

03:39.373 --> 03:42.331
Imagine how much more fun
it would be if we was both naked.

03:46.613 --> 03:48.922
Will, you just hit on me
from force of habit.

03:49.093 --> 03:51.004
Now, if you really
wanna go out with me...

03:51.173 --> 03:53.528
...why not step to me like a man?

03:56.933 --> 03:58.924
Well, okay.

04:09.693 --> 04:11.285
So Jacqueline...

04:13.453 --> 04:16.091
I wonder if you'd do me
the honor of having dinner with me.

04:16.253 --> 04:17.652
Okay.

04:18.373 --> 04:20.329
"Okay"?

04:20.493 --> 04:23.769
"Okay" is all right if I offered you
a government cheese sandwich...

04:23.933 --> 04:28.006
...but I'm offering you
a buffet of love, child.

04:28.733 --> 04:32.328
Take it easy, homey.
I mean, you asked like a gentleman.

04:32.493 --> 04:35.405
If you keep acting like a gentleman
maybe we can get somewhere.

04:35.933 --> 04:38.891
Somewhere that we could talk
lying down?

04:39.053 --> 04:40.884
- Will!
- All right, Jackie, I'm sorry.

04:41.053 --> 04:43.169
A temporary cool breakdown.
I'm back now.

04:43.333 --> 04:46.052
Look, so when is good for you?

04:46.733 --> 04:50.169
I don't know. I was thinking about
this afternoon leading into the evening.

04:51.253 --> 04:55.292
You know what the evening leads...
I'm sorry, I need to have that treated.

04:55.453 --> 04:58.092
- I'm sorry.
- I'll call you later.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.693
Come without the stupid hat, okay?

05:04.933 --> 05:09.609
Hey, girl, I was...
Would you stop it! Stop, stop, stop.

05:14.293 --> 05:18.047
Hilary, are you really going to pose
in that magazine?

05:18.213 --> 05:20.886
- Why? Does it bother you?
- A little.

05:21.053 --> 05:23.851
I don't even like to get undressed
in gym class.

05:28.853 --> 05:31.731
Ashley, your body is going
through some changes...

05:31.893 --> 05:35.044
...and they may seem
awkward and embarrassing...

05:35.213 --> 05:37.773
...but I promise you,
it's completely normal.

05:37.933 --> 05:41.130
And the discomfort,
it's only temporary.

05:42.413 --> 05:44.369
I know. I look great naked.

05:47.333 --> 05:50.769
It's just that I don't like a bunch
of gooney people staring at me.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.652
Oh, you get used to it.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.845
I guess I could kiss heaven goodbye...

06:01.013 --> 06:03.481
...because it got to be a sin
to look this good.

06:10.573 --> 06:14.009
You've been playing tennis
with the gardener again, haven't you?

06:16.293 --> 06:17.567
You do look great, Will.

06:17.733 --> 06:19.530
Thanks a lot, Hil.
You can help me out.

06:19.693 --> 06:21.888
I need a name of a smoking place
to take a date.

06:22.053 --> 06:24.362
Sure, we can talk about it
on the way to the party.

06:24.533 --> 06:27.491
- I'm gonna go get dressed.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What party?

06:27.653 --> 06:30.042
Well, isn't that why
you're all dressed up?

06:30.253 --> 06:32.562
Oh, did I forget to tell you?

06:33.133 --> 06:35.601
I think you're still in the process
of forgetting.

06:37.733 --> 06:39.007
<i>Playboy called.</i>

06:39.173 --> 06:41.209
They're having a pool party
at the Mansion...

06:41.373 --> 06:43.125
...to kick off the weather girl shoot.

06:43.693 --> 06:44.967
And?

06:45.133 --> 06:48.967
And since you stood up for me
with Daddy, I'm taking you.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.647
Yes, I knew that.

06:54.213 --> 06:57.205
Let me tell you, you're the best cousin
a brother ever had.

06:58.173 --> 07:00.607
I'm going to the Playboy Mansion.

07:02.853 --> 07:05.083
Well, hello, Hef.

07:05.253 --> 07:07.403
Oh, pshaw.

07:07.573 --> 07:09.882
Don't be silly.
I'm glad I could come.

07:10.893 --> 07:14.727
Oh, Miss December.
Oh, baby, I was gonna call you.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.043
Come here, girl.

07:21.813 --> 07:23.610
Excuse me, Master William...

07:23.773 --> 07:27.243
...if you can tear yourself away
from your imaginary friend...

07:28.613 --> 07:31.332
...a Miss Jacqueline's on the phone.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.643
I forgot all about Jackie.

07:33.813 --> 07:35.326
Look, G. G, G...

07:35.493 --> 07:38.485
If you had to decide between
going on a date with a girl...

07:38.653 --> 07:41.929
...you care about and going to
the Playboy Mansion, which would it be?

07:42.093 --> 07:44.288
The fact you're even asking,
Master William...

07:44.453 --> 07:46.762
...tells me that you
really care about the lady.

07:47.373 --> 07:50.729
- I guess I do.
- Admirable.

07:50.893 --> 07:54.852
Tell me, might this young lady
have a terminal illness?

07:57.693 --> 07:59.285
No, G, of course not.

07:59.453 --> 08:03.128
Then may I point out,
she'll still be here tomorrow.

08:16.173 --> 08:18.050
Oh, I'm sorry, babe. I'm sick.

08:18.213 --> 08:22.968
No, no, no, don't come over.
Because, you know, I could be catchy.

08:23.133 --> 08:26.603
Well, you know, I guess
I'll just have to talk to you tomorrow?

08:28.893 --> 08:30.372
Bye.

08:32.013 --> 08:33.082
So...

08:33.253 --> 08:35.528
...when do we leave
for the Mansion?

08:37.373 --> 08:40.011
Oh, they don't need you, G.
They're fully staffed.

08:51.573 --> 08:55.532
Either that is one tight dress
or a really good paint job.

08:56.653 --> 08:59.008
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait a minute, Will.

08:59.173 --> 09:02.290
- I think I'm having second thoughts.
- What do you mean?

09:02.453 --> 09:06.571
I don't know if doing the layout is worth
having Daddy hate me the rest of my life.

09:06.733 --> 09:08.724
No, no, no,
it's only the rest of his life.

09:10.573 --> 09:13.292
After them pictures come out,
how much longer could he have?

09:13.453 --> 09:16.126
- Will.
- I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking.

09:16.293 --> 09:18.727
- I thought you wanted to do the pictures.
- Well, I do.

09:18.893 --> 09:22.806
I'm saying you can't just let your pop
be pushing you around all the time.

09:22.973 --> 09:25.965
<i>It would be so much easier
if only he liked Playboy.</i>

09:26.853 --> 09:28.491
Liked it?

09:28.653 --> 09:31.565
He's got issues in his bathroom
from, like, 1964.

09:33.293 --> 09:36.410
Come on, just don't worry about it.
Let's just go to the party.

09:36.573 --> 09:37.847
Freeze!

09:38.453 --> 09:41.763
Oh, look, the Little Republican Store
must've opened.

09:43.133 --> 09:45.772
Good joke, Will.
I'll laugh on the way to the party.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.083
Whoa, teeny.

09:49.493 --> 09:51.529
What makes you think
you're going to the party?

09:51.693 --> 09:53.445
I'm not gonna miss out
on Princeton...

09:53.613 --> 09:56.252
...because she wants to expose
her weather balloons.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.127
Carlton, I think
Geoffrey's baking cookies.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.563
Oh, no, you don't.

10:09.333 --> 10:12.211
Look, I'm gonna talk to Mr. Hefner
and put a stop to this.

10:12.373 --> 10:15.331
My voice will be heard.
You must take me with you.

10:16.733 --> 10:18.052
Sure.

10:23.173 --> 10:27.291
- How can you let him come with us?
- Trust me, he ain't gonna say nothing.

10:27.453 --> 10:29.205
Well, how can you be so sure?

10:29.373 --> 10:32.092
Boy gets hot and bothered
talking to average-looking girls.

10:32.253 --> 10:35.006
Five minutes at the Mansion,
he's gonna go into meltdown.

10:45.373 --> 10:49.286
I can't believe it, girl.
Yo, it's just like the magazine.

10:49.453 --> 10:53.332
Except the girls ain't got folds
in the middle and jokes on their back.

10:58.053 --> 10:59.611
Carlton, stand up.

10:59.773 --> 11:02.048
You're drooling on my pumps.

11:02.773 --> 11:04.411
Come on, you guys.

11:05.573 --> 11:07.245
My legs are like rubber.

11:07.413 --> 11:10.166
Yeah, and your head is like a peanut.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.483
What was it you wanted to say
to Mr. Hefner?

11:13.653 --> 11:15.723
I want to tell him
how much I love this place.

11:15.893 --> 11:18.123
Hey, look at that swimming pool.

11:21.053 --> 11:23.408
I have never seen
so many people in one place...

11:23.573 --> 11:26.804
...I wanted to give
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to.

11:27.773 --> 11:29.525
Breathing okay?

11:32.293 --> 11:34.568
- Hey, Hugh.
- Will, why are you shouting at me?

11:34.733 --> 11:36.564
- I'm right next to you.
- Not you. Hugh.

11:36.733 --> 11:39.850
- You who?
- Stop yodeling. Hugh Hefner.

11:40.733 --> 11:45.011
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Mr. Hefner, what an honor.

11:45.173 --> 11:47.528
I'm Will Smith.
This is my cousin Hilary.

11:47.693 --> 11:50.048
Oh, a pleasure. Hilary Banks.

11:50.213 --> 11:52.807
I'm glad you could make it.
Let me show you around.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.929
- Oh, I'd be honored.
- Relax, guys.

11:55.093 --> 11:57.732
Have some fun.
There are suits in the bathhouse.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.845
Yeah.

12:01.173 --> 12:02.686
You def, Hef.

12:02.853 --> 12:04.445
Why didn't you introduce me?

12:05.773 --> 12:09.482
Hey, Carlton, I gotta be honest, man,
I forgot you was even here.

12:09.653 --> 12:12.087
Oh, that's just great.

12:13.373 --> 12:16.092
Hey, Will, isn't that Jazz?

12:19.733 --> 12:21.644
Jazz, what are you doing here?

12:22.613 --> 12:23.932
I'm on the list.

12:24.093 --> 12:26.732
<i>They think I'm the black dude
from Mod Squad.</i>

12:35.053 --> 12:37.248
Would you like to have dinner
with the children?

12:37.413 --> 12:41.122
- Yes, that would be nice, Geoffrey.
- Too bad. They're not here.

12:42.853 --> 12:44.571
Then why did you bring it up?

12:44.733 --> 12:48.885
If you don't care where
your children are, sir, neither do I.

12:49.053 --> 12:52.284
Okay, where are they?

12:52.453 --> 12:53.772
Sir...

12:53.933 --> 12:57.050
...I could never betray
their confidence.

13:00.813 --> 13:02.963
They're at the Playboy Mansion.

13:03.133 --> 13:07.012
All except young Ashley.
She's upstairs with her boyfriend.

13:08.693 --> 13:11.332
- That one's on the house.
- Vivian!

13:11.493 --> 13:13.563
Vivian! Vivian!

13:13.733 --> 13:16.805
Oh, Philip, did you call me?

13:16.973 --> 13:21.012
- Do you know where your children are?
- Sure, they're at the Playboy Mansion.

13:21.173 --> 13:23.004
How come you knew that
and I didn't?

13:23.173 --> 13:25.607
- Because they talk to me.
- Why don't they talk to me?

13:25.773 --> 13:28.003
Because you don't listen. Every time...

13:40.493 --> 13:43.451
So, baby, what you doing
after the party?

13:43.613 --> 13:45.683
Actually, I'll be in surgery.

13:47.173 --> 13:50.643
Looks like everything
on that body is in working order.

13:51.293 --> 13:54.285
I'll be performing surgery.
I'm a doctor.

13:55.933 --> 13:59.050
Well, doc, you can check me
out anytime, trust me.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.205
I'm a cardiologist.
You need a pediatrician.

14:04.933 --> 14:07.970
Miss March, right? I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.852
Don't tell me, don't tell me,
don't tell me. Turn-ons:

14:11.013 --> 14:15.131
Fast cars, shrimp bouillabaisse
and Indian quilts, right?

14:15.293 --> 14:16.567
Very impressive.

14:16.733 --> 14:19.167
- Now, do you remember my turnoffs?
- Do I?

14:19.333 --> 14:20.766
Hairy backs, smokers...

14:20.933 --> 14:23.686
...and abrasive young men
who don't know when to shut up.

14:23.853 --> 14:25.605
Bingo.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.883
Girl, what would it take for a guy
like me to get next to a girl like you?

14:32.293 --> 14:34.727
Five years and six figures.

14:36.613 --> 14:38.444
Thank you very much.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.528
So tell me about yourself.

14:41.693 --> 14:44.048
I have a boyfriend
who plays on the Lakers.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.843
I suppose your boyfriend's
a tackle for the Rams, huh?

14:49.013 --> 14:51.243
No, the Raiders.

14:51.413 --> 14:53.085
Get away from me.

14:55.493 --> 14:57.768
Hey, Will. Hey, this place is great.

14:57.933 --> 14:59.161
I've got two numbers...

14:59.333 --> 15:02.564
...and if I play my cards right,
I think she'll give me the other five.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.682
I don't think I'm gonna hang around
to find out.

15:05.853 --> 15:08.572
Being here helped me
realize how important Jackie...

15:08.733 --> 15:10.166
Bunny hop!

15:12.253 --> 15:14.369
...really is to me.

15:33.053 --> 15:36.648
- What do you think you're doing?
- The bunny hop.

15:40.293 --> 15:41.567
Where's your sister?

15:41.733 --> 15:45.009
She went to Malibu with the weather
girls to have their pictures taken.

15:45.173 --> 15:46.447
Go wait in the car, Carlton.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.207
But I was just gonna go talk
to Mr. Hefner about Hilary...

15:49.373 --> 15:51.489
Go get in the car, Carlton.

15:57.173 --> 16:00.768
I really wanna thank you for taking
the time to talk to me, Mr. Hefner.

16:00.933 --> 16:04.608
Well, it's always a pleasure
to talk to a long-time subscriber.

16:07.453 --> 16:09.330
My man, Linc.

16:12.253 --> 16:14.244
I wanna cut right to the chase here.

16:14.413 --> 16:16.973
It's about my daughter
posing for your magazine.

16:17.133 --> 16:21.092
I mean, well, how would
you feel if your daughter...

16:21.253 --> 16:23.084
...got involved in this whole world?

16:23.413 --> 16:26.371
Well, my daughter is involved
in this whole world.

16:26.533 --> 16:28.524
<i>She runs the Playboy empire.</i>

16:29.093 --> 16:32.972
Okay, let's try this a different way.

16:33.133 --> 16:36.728
Well, look, suppose somebody
that you really care about...

16:36.893 --> 16:40.169
...like your wife,
suppose she decided to pose?

16:41.133 --> 16:43.442
Well, my wife
was the Playmate of the Year...

16:43.613 --> 16:45.569
...and I'm very proud of her.

16:46.853 --> 16:48.571
Don't you understand...

16:48.733 --> 16:52.089
...there are some parents who are
not comfortable with their daughters...

16:52.253 --> 16:54.721
...being stared at
by millions of people?

16:55.013 --> 16:56.924
I understand
where you're coming from.

16:57.093 --> 17:00.005
Look, over the years,
I've had to deal with a lot of parents.

17:00.173 --> 17:02.129
You seem like a good man.

17:02.293 --> 17:06.570
Let me put it this way: I promise you,
the pictures will be tasteful.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.484
Tasteful?

17:08.653 --> 17:11.531
Oh, yeah, right.
I know what that means.

17:11.693 --> 17:14.082
Well, thank you very much.

17:19.373 --> 17:21.568
Jackie, you're here.

17:21.733 --> 17:23.644
Will, I thought you were sick.

17:23.813 --> 17:26.088
Oh, yeah, I was.

17:26.252 --> 17:28.972
You know, I...
At least I thought I was.

17:29.133 --> 17:32.842
You know, actually, I had
an allergic reaction...

17:33.013 --> 17:34.287
...to bunnies.

17:36.533 --> 17:39.206
So, say, what's up with that date?

17:39.773 --> 17:44.289
I'm sorry, Will, but when you cancelled
on me, I made plans to go to the movies.

17:44.893 --> 17:47.726
Cool. Just call up your little girlfriend
and break them.

17:47.893 --> 17:51.169
My " little girlfriend" is 6'2"
with a mustache.

17:53.653 --> 17:56.690
What kind of monster are you?

17:57.333 --> 18:00.405
A man is laying up in his deathbed,
and you go stepping out on him?

18:00.573 --> 18:03.531
Hey, Will, you and me ain't all that.

18:04.133 --> 18:07.125
Okay, okay, okay.
What are you doing after the movies?

18:07.293 --> 18:09.568
I think that's between me and Tony.

18:11.333 --> 18:14.052
- Okay, how about tomorrow night?
- I got basketball practice.

18:14.213 --> 18:16.488
- Cool. I'll watch.
- You can't. You're working.

18:16.653 --> 18:20.487
Mike called in sick. He probably has
what you thought you did.

18:21.213 --> 18:23.488
- Okay, next Saturday night?
- Bachelorette party.

18:23.653 --> 18:25.405
- Christmas?
- I'm going home to Philly.

18:25.573 --> 18:28.963
Then New Year's Eve?
Groundhog Day?

18:29.133 --> 18:31.283
Cinco de Mayo?

18:31.453 --> 18:32.886
Rosh Hashanah?

18:38.013 --> 18:40.891
- I hope you're proud of yourself, Vivian.
- What did I do?

18:41.053 --> 18:44.682
Your daughter is somewhere
in Malibu stark naked.

18:44.853 --> 18:46.332
What are you talking about?

18:46.493 --> 18:49.690
<i>She went and posed for Playboy,
and you encouraged her.</i>

18:49.853 --> 18:51.571
I did no such thing.

18:51.733 --> 18:54.486
When I talked to her,
she hadn't made up her mind yet.

18:54.653 --> 18:56.405
If anything pushed her
over the edge...

18:56.573 --> 19:00.122
...it was your usual
"do it my way or else" charm.

19:00.293 --> 19:03.763
Don't you start with me, Vivian.
No matter what I did, she's my daughter.

19:03.933 --> 19:05.525
A daughter should obey her father.

19:05.693 --> 19:08.253
In that case,
I never would've married you.

19:10.213 --> 19:13.523
Oh, that was different.
Your father had it in for me.

19:13.693 --> 19:15.809
What was it again
he didn't like about me?

19:15.973 --> 19:18.533
It was a tie between your family
and your temper.

19:19.933 --> 19:22.606
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
I sure don't miss him.

19:23.293 --> 19:25.204
God rest his soul.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.050
Sweetheart, listen.

19:29.213 --> 19:35.448
Sometimes a parent has to step back
and let their child find their own way.

19:42.853 --> 19:44.889
I'll be upstairs.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.092
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

19:51.373 --> 19:54.046
Daddy, I'm sorry,
but I've already had my pictures taken.

19:54.213 --> 19:56.647
- It's all right.
- It was my choice and...

19:57.853 --> 19:59.252
It's all right?

19:59.413 --> 20:01.768
You're not a child anymore.

20:02.573 --> 20:03.892
You're a beautiful woman.

20:05.093 --> 20:06.924
<i>Beautiful enough for
Playboy to ask...</i>

20:07.093 --> 20:09.846
...and woman enough
to make your own decisions.

20:10.493 --> 20:12.802
No matter what, I still love you.

20:14.053 --> 20:15.372
Oh, Daddy.

20:22.133 --> 20:25.330
So when are your pictures
coming out?

20:25.493 --> 20:28.371
They said in about two months.

20:28.533 --> 20:32.082
You understand, of course,
I can't be here when they do.

20:48.453 --> 20:50.011
Enter.

20:52.733 --> 20:54.007
It's arrived, Uncle Phil.

20:54.173 --> 20:55.731
I don't wanna see them.

20:55.893 --> 20:59.602
It came in the mail today
with a personal letter from Mr. Hefner.

20:59.773 --> 21:02.412
He thinks you should take a look at it.
So do I.

21:02.573 --> 21:04.450
You can forget it, because I'm...

21:06.413 --> 21:09.723
Oh, all right.

21:16.813 --> 21:19.611
Look at that. She's covered up.

21:24.173 --> 21:27.006
Hallelujah, she's covered up!

21:31.333 --> 21:34.086
But this little girl is not.

21:38.373 --> 21:40.489
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

21:48.133 --> 21:50.727
You heard our father: No!

21:51.933 --> 21:53.491
Carlton, what do you care?

21:53.653 --> 21:55.609
Look, I will not be
publicly embarrassed...

21:55.773 --> 22:00.483
...by a problem of delivering
my damn lines.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.531
It won't happen, damn it.
It ain't gonna happen.

22:03.693 --> 22:06.048
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I'm not gonna allow it.

22:06.213 --> 22:08.488
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It's over!

22:08.653 --> 22:10.052
It's all right, man!

22:10.213 --> 22:11.726
- Let it go, man.
- It's over.

22:11.893 --> 22:13.042
- It's okay.
- All right.
