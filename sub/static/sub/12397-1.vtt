00:09.070 --> 00:11.129
- [bad cockney accent]
NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING

00:11.170 --> 00:13.070
HOW THIS ALL HAPPENED.

00:13.110 --> 00:15.032
AND LIKELY YOU'RE BLAMING GUS

00:15.080 --> 00:17.344
AND HIS OBSESSIVE NEED
TO GO TO POTI'ERCON.

00:17.380 --> 00:18.540
THAT'S THE HARRY POTTER
FESTIVAL.

00:18.580 --> 00:20.116
- NOBODY'S BLAMING ME.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.378
AND WHY ARE YOU
USING THAT ACCENT?

00:21.420 --> 00:22.682
- ACCENT?
BOLLOCKS, GUS.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.585
THIS IS MY NATURAL TIM-BRE.

00:26.520 --> 00:29.557
[normal voice] THIS ALL STARTED
BACK IN SANTA BARBARA.

00:32.930 --> 00:34.852
THE NEW CHIEF
HADN'T HIRED US IN WEEKS

00:34.900 --> 00:36.458
WHEN SUDDENLY I GOT A CALL.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.762
[phone rings]
HELLO?

00:37.800 --> 00:40.769
- UH, I ANSWERED THE PHONE.
- FINE.

00:47.540 --> 00:50.179
- [suave]
HELLO?

00:50.210 --> 00:52.269
- YO, YOU'VE NEVER ANSWERED
THE PHONE THAT WAY.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.015
AND WHY WOULD YOU POSSIBLY
BE DRESSED LIKE THAT?

00:54.050 --> 00:55.210
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO GETS TO EMBELLISH.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.410
- ALL RIGHT, TRUCE.

00:56.450 --> 00:58.042
FACTS ONLY FROM HERE ON OUT.

00:58.090 --> 00:59.182
IT WAS INTERPOL.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.881
YES, THAT INTERPOL.

01:00.920 --> 01:04.287
THE ONE ON
THE DVD WARNING SCREEN.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.753
WE HAD BEEN REQUESTED FOR A CASE

01:06.800 --> 01:08.199
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
OF BRITAIN.

01:08.230 --> 01:09.959
THAT'S ENGLAND.
- WE GET IT, SHAWN.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.992
- WITHIN HOURS,
GUS HAD INVITED HIMSELF ALONG,

01:13.040 --> 01:14.359
AND WE WERE ZIPPING
THROUGH SECURITY

01:14.400 --> 01:17.233
AT THE AIRPORT.
- WE WERE BEING DETAINED.

01:17.270 --> 01:20.239
- AND YOU JUST FORGOT TO MENTION
THIS HIDDEN COMPARTMENT?

01:20.280 --> 01:23.078
_ THAT IS A PHOENIX FEATHER,
SIR, NOT A WEAPON.

01:23.110 --> 01:25.203
IF YOU WERE FAMILIAR
WITH THE MOST POPULAR FRANCHISE

01:25.250 --> 01:27.275
IN THE HISTORY OF FILM,
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T EXPERIENCE

01:27.320 --> 01:28.571
SUCH CON FUSION HERE.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.609
- MY APOLOGIES.

01:29.650 --> 01:31.242
MY NORMALLY SANE BUDDY

01:31.290 --> 01:33.588
IS A LITTLE ON EDGE
BECAUSE OF THE VERY TIGHT WINDOW

01:33.620 --> 01:35.884
THAT EXISTS BETWEEN OUR ARRIVAL
AT HEATHROW

01:35.920 --> 01:37.285
AND THE RUPERT GRINT
MEET-AND-GREET

01:37.330 --> 01:38.957
AT LEICESTER SQUARE.

01:38.990 --> 01:41.026
- I AM A GRINT GRUNT,
LOUD AND PROUD.

01:41.060 --> 01:42.925
- MEANWHILE,
I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED

01:42.970 --> 01:44.699
TO HELP INTERPOL WITH A CASE.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.630
YOU KNOW INTERPOL.

01:46.670 --> 01:49.969
FROM THE DVDs?

01:50.010 --> 01:51.807
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

01:51.840 --> 01:55.901
HE'S NOT BRINGING A GIANT,
SHARP, WOODEN STICK

01:55.940 --> 01:57.441
AS A CARRY-ON.

01:57.480 --> 02:01.314
- THAT "STICK" IS A NIMBUS 2000,

02:01.350 --> 02:03.011
A GIFT
THE WIZARD PO'I'I'ER RECEIVED

02:03.050 --> 02:05.109
FROM MINERVA MCGONAGALL,
WHEN HE JOINED

02:05.150 --> 02:07.050
THE GRYFFINDOR QUIDDITCH TEAM
AS A SEEKER...

02:07.090 --> 02:08.751
WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW

02:08.790 --> 02:10.052
IF YOU HAD EVER SUCCESSFULLY
OPENED A BOOK!

02:10.090 --> 02:12.627
- GUS.
- WHAT? I'M CALM.

02:12.660 --> 02:14.651
- THAT WAS THE POINT
OUR BAGS WERE REMOVED

02:14.700 --> 02:17.260
FROM THE PLANE.
- NO, IT WASN'T.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.564
- CORRECTION.
- I NEED MY POTIONS!

02:19.600 --> 02:22.160
- THAT WAS.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.269
18 HOURS LATER,
MISSING ONLY OUR LUGGAGE,

02:24.310 --> 02:26.005
WE ARRIVED AT INTERPOL--

02:26.040 --> 02:28.031
INTERNATIONAL POLICE
ORGANIZATION.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.048
THEY ISSUE THE WARNINGS
ON THE BLU-RAY DISCS.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.945
- WE'VE COVERED THIS.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.816
- THANK YOU FOR COMING,
MR. SPENCER.

02:35.850 --> 02:37.488
YOU'RE SAVING OUR LIVES HERE.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.010
I'M WINSTON.

02:39.050 --> 02:40.586
I'LL BE BRIEFING YOU
UNTIL MY BOSS ARRIVES.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.485
- AH, YES, HER MAJESTY,
THE QUEEN.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.181
NOW, DOES SHE PREFER
LIZ OR LIZZIE?

02:45.230 --> 02:47.095
- WE WERE NEVER
GONNA MEET THE QUEEN.

02:47.130 --> 02:49.325
- PERHAPS YOU WERE CONFUSED BY
WHAT WILFRED WAS TRYING TO SAY.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.760
- HIS NAME WAS WINSTON
- OKAY, PERHAPS I WAS CONFUSED.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.734
FROM WHENCE
SHALL I BEGIN MY INVESTIGATION?

02:54.770 --> 02:56.306
- OH, MR. SPENCER,
YOU WERE NEVER BROUGHT HERE

02:56.340 --> 02:58.103
TO INVESTIGATE ANYTHING.

02:58.140 --> 03:00.335
- SOUNDS LIKE A WASTED
PLANE TICKET IF YOU ASK ME.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.907
- WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A LONG UNDERCOVER STING.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.817
YOU BEAR MORE
THAN A PASSABLE RESEMBLANCE

03:06.850 --> 03:08.772
TO AN AMERICAN GETAWAY DRIVER

03:08.820 --> 03:11.038
IN A PLANNED HEIST
WE'RE INVESTIGATING.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.854
THE YARD--
- THAT MEANS SCOTLAND YARD.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.255
- THEY KNOW.
- NICKED OUR DRIVER

03:15.290 --> 03:18.157
TWO DAYS AGO...
- THAT MEANS ARRESTED.

03:18.190 --> 03:20.158
- WILL YOU SHUT UP?
JUST SHUT UP, SHAWN.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.395
- MUCKING UP OUR WHOLE STING.

03:22.430 --> 03:24.728
WE THOUGHT WE WERE DONE FOR.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.897
UNTIL WE HEARD OF YOU.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.362
- HEH.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.903
CLEARLY MY EXPLOITS
ARE RENOWNED WORLDWIDE.

03:30.940 --> 03:33.135
- I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE AN INVESTIGATOR.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.738
MY SUPERIOR ASKED FOR YOU.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.338
- SWEET LIZZIE.
CHEEKY OLD DAME.

03:36.380 --> 03:39.941
WHERE'S HER OFFICE?

03:39.980 --> 03:43.245
- HIS NAME IS
ROYSTON CORNWALLIS STALEY.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.087
HE'S OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.418
APPARENTLY YOU TWO MET
WHILE HE WAS UNDERCOVER.

03:49.190 --> 03:52.398
- [screams]

03:52.430 --> 03:53.727
- TAKE ME TO HIM.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.954
- YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.

03:55.000 --> 03:55.989
AND IT'S NEVER OKAY

03:56.030 --> 03:59.864
TO THROW HOT TEA IN MY FACE.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.403
- APPARENTLY YOU TWO MET
WHILE HE WAS UNDERCOVER.

04:02.440 --> 04:06.228
- ROYCE STALEY, YOU SAY?
HA.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.135
WELL, FIRST I'D LIKE TO TRY
THESE "CRUMPETS"

04:09.180 --> 04:11.341
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT,

04:11.380 --> 04:13.041
AND THEN IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

04:13.080 --> 04:14.513
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH HIM.

04:14.550 --> 04:15.915
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
OF COURSE.

04:15.950 --> 04:17.713
[elevator bell clings]

04:19.050 --> 04:20.586
- MR. STALEY IS EXPECTING US.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.429
- SPOTTED DICK?
SPOTTED DICK?

04:22.460 --> 04:25.452
THREE SPOTTED DICKS, PLEASE.

04:25.490 --> 04:26.798
- HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT PLUTO?

04:26.830 --> 04:28.195
- NO.
- [grunts]

04:28.230 --> 04:30.960
- SIR, THEY HAVE ARRIVED.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.647
- SHAWN.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.307
BUSTER.

04:47.180 --> 04:51.139
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

04:51.190 --> 04:54.250
*

04:54.290 --> 04:57.782
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

04:57.830 --> 05:01.049
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

05:01.100 --> 05:02.658
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

05:02.700 --> 05:04.588
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

05:04.630 --> 05:07.838
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

05:07.870 --> 05:09.804
-*OOH

05:09.840 --> 05:13.071
- * YOU'D RATHER RUN

05:13.110 --> 05:15.499

05:15.540 --> 05:19.044
* I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT
I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

05:19.080 --> 05:22.072
* I KNOW YOU KNOW THEY
JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

05:34.160 --> 05:35.422
- YOU INFILTRATED INTERPOL?

05:35.460 --> 05:36.495
- HOW DID YOU
PULL THAT OFF, MAN?

05:36.530 --> 05:38.327
- THIS IS NOT OKAY.

05:38.370 --> 05:40.258
- I'M PERSONALLY NEUTRAL.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.063
- HE'S RIGHT, I'M OUTRAGED.
- HOW'S THIS POSSIBLE?

05:42.100 --> 05:44.307
- WELL, AFTER A LONG
AND GLAMOUR-FREE CAREER

05:44.340 --> 05:46.570
AS AN ANALYST HERE AT INTERPOL,

05:46.610 --> 05:49.977
WE FOUND THAT THE CRIMINAL WORLD
HAD BECOME MORE INSULAR.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.979
WE HAD LITTLE
TO NO INSIDE INFORMATION.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.978
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
WE WERE LOSING.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.341
WE NEEDED A BOLD NEW IDEA.

05:58.390 --> 06:00.915
AND I GOT MY FIRST CHANCE
TO GO UNDERCOVER

06:00.960 --> 06:03.520
FROM MY BOSS, WIM STUWESANT.
- WIM?

06:03.560 --> 06:05.528
- WELL, THIS IS
AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.324
WE, UH--WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST THE DUTCH HERE.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.693
SO UNDERAPPRECIATED DESK JOCKEY
ROY STALEY

06:11.730 --> 06:13.698
WAS ERASED AND DECOMMISSIONED,

06:13.740 --> 06:18.109
AND THE CHARACTER
OF PIERRE DESPEREAUX WAS BORN.

06:19.310 --> 06:21.107
WITHIN A YEAR I WAS A STAR

06:21.140 --> 06:24.541
OF THE INTERNATIONAL
CRIME COMMUNITY...

06:24.580 --> 06:27.378
PERFORMING HEISTS ORGANIZED
SECRETLY BY THE DIVISION,

06:27.420 --> 06:29.342
GETTING PRIME INFORMATION

06:29.380 --> 06:32.110
ON THE LONDON UNDERWORLD
UNDETECTED.

06:32.150 --> 06:34.459
53 ARRESTS.
ALL CONVICT IONS.

06:34.490 --> 06:36.526
- THE THEFTS WERE ALL SET-UPS?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.152
- I DIDN'T ACTUALLY
STEAL ANY ITEMS.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.691
I WAS GIVEN THEM.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.459
- BUT YOU WENT TO PRISON.
- YES.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.162
BECAUSE OF YOU I BROUGHT DOWN
TWO KINGPINS INSIDE.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.929
I MEANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.461
- YOU NEVER STOLE ANYTHING?
- GOT IT.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.331
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
THE EXPRESSION "ONE FOR ME..."

06:50.370 --> 06:53.134
HELLO, REMBRANDT.
"ONE FOR YOU"?

06:53.180 --> 06:55.136
- I HAVE.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.341
- FORTUNATELY, MY SIDE WORK
WAS UNDER THE RADAR.

06:57.380 --> 06:59.200
PRETTY HARMLESS STUFF,
REALLY.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.878
OR PERHAPS THAT IS
UNTIL I GOT RECALLED.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.042
- YOU DIDN'T DO THAT ALONE?

07:05.090 --> 07:07.115
- YOU DON'T ACTUALLY THINK
THAT I MANAGED TO DO ALL OF THAT

07:07.160 --> 07:08.650
BY MYSELF, DO YOU?

07:08.690 --> 07:09.918
- [chuckles]
- NO.

07:09.960 --> 07:13.054
- I DID.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.022
- ON THE DAY OF MY RETURN
TO SERVICE,

07:15.060 --> 07:18.621
WE FINALLY RECEIVED A TIP ON
THE MOTHER LODE OF ALL CROOKS--

07:18.670 --> 07:20.797
CRIMINAL BOSS RONNIE IVES.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.059
RONNIE IS A BRUTAL THUG
WHO PULLS OFF ENORMOUS CRIMES

07:24.110 --> 07:27.534
AND RETREATS BACK INTO
THE SHADOWS WITHOUT A TRACE.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.676
HE'S SMART, EFFICIENT, AND NEVER
WORKS WITH THE SAME CREW TWICE.

07:31.710 --> 07:35.578
HE ASSEMBLES A CREW OF STRANGERS
IN A KEYSER SOZE MANNER,

07:35.620 --> 07:37.440
NONE OF THEM KNOWING EACH OTHER,
AND THRUSTS THEM

07:37.490 --> 07:39.446
INTO HIS METICULOUSLY
PRE-PLANNED HEISTS.

07:39.490 --> 07:41.048
[gunshots]

07:41.090 --> 07:43.524
THEN IMMEDIATELY
DISBANDS THE GROUP

07:43.560 --> 07:45.881
AT THE END OF EACH JOB.

07:45.930 --> 07:48.421
HE RECENTLY ASSEMBLED
A NEW TEAM.

07:48.460 --> 07:50.963
WE KNEW WHERE THEY WERE MEETING.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.391
THAT IS UNTIL THE MAD AMERICAN
GOT HIMSELF ARRESTED.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.169
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.235
- NOPE.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOPE?

07:59.270 --> 08:01.272
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

08:01.310 --> 08:02.675
AS A POLICE-SANCTIONED CRIMINAL.

08:02.710 --> 08:05.304
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU PULLED THIS OFF,

08:05.350 --> 08:07.477
BUT KUDOS TO YOU.
THIS IS ALL A FAKE--

08:07.520 --> 08:10.409
THIS OFFICE, THAT AMAZING
SECRETARY OUT THERE,

08:10.450 --> 08:11.712
PERHAPS THIS WHOLE COUNTRY.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.354
AND THERE'S NO AMERICAN

08:13.390 --> 08:15.119
CRAZED GETAWAY CAR DRIVER
DOPPELGANGER

08:15.160 --> 08:17.549
WHO HAPPENS TO LOOK
EXACTLY LIKE SHAWN.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.956
- DID YOU BRING A COAT?

08:21.700 --> 08:23.998
GENTLEMEN,
I GIVE YOU ROBERT FINO,

08:24.030 --> 08:26.737
PHILADELPHIA BORN AND BRED
GETAWAY DRIVER.

08:26.770 --> 08:29.864
PERHAPS NOW YOU CAN SEE
WHY I THOUGHT OF YOU, SHAWN.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.111
- THIS MAN LOOKS
NOTHING LIKE ME.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.515
- WHAT?
- HIS HAIR IS FINE AND SILKY,

08:41.550 --> 08:43.347
AS IF SPUN BY A FABULOUS SPIDER.

08:43.390 --> 08:46.086
MINE IS A HELMET,
A PERFECT, BROWN HELMET

08:46.120 --> 08:48.850
INSPIRED BY THE LIVES
OF REAL BEAVERS.

08:48.890 --> 08:51.154
- [spits]

08:52.290 --> 08:55.350
- [yeIPSJ

08:55.400 --> 08:57.595
OKAY.
I MAY NOT BE THE BEST JUDGE,

08:57.630 --> 08:59.495
BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE
ALL LOOK ALIKE TO ME,

08:59.530 --> 09:01.669
BUT, ALTHOUGH SHOCKINGLY CLOSE,

09:01.700 --> 09:04.533
I DON'T THINK
HE'S AN EXACT MATCH.

09:04.570 --> 09:07.505
- RONNIE NEVER WORKS
WITH ANYONE HE HAS MET.

09:07.540 --> 09:09.804
AND THEIR FIRST MEETING
IS SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.909
- SO WHY DOESN'T HE GO?
- YEAH?

09:11.950 --> 09:13.713
- [spits]
- WHAT?

09:13.750 --> 09:16.071
- HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO WANT TO COOPERATE.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.587
HE HASN'T SAID A WORD.

09:17.620 --> 09:20.259
BUT, UH, HMM, PASSES
THE OCCASIONAL NOTE.

09:23.690 --> 09:26.158
- "RONNIE IS GOING
TO SLICE HIS THROAT

09:26.190 --> 09:28.590
WITH A STRAIGHT EDGE RAZOR."

09:28.630 --> 09:30.461
YOU MISSPELLED "RAZOR."

09:30.500 --> 09:32.161
- WOULD YOU LIKE HIM
TO CORRECT IT?

09:32.200 --> 09:35.499
- WHERE'S THE PRIDE, SHAWN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.462
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

09:37.510 --> 09:41.628
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THE RANGE OF MY SKILL SET.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.148
- [spits]

09:44.180 --> 09:46.671
- LET'S HOPE TO GOD
THAT YOU'RE A FAST LEARNER.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.087
- MY NAME IS ROBERT FINO.
- WHAT WAS YOUR MOTHER'S NAME?

09:50.120 --> 09:51.712
- DIDN'T HAVE ONE.
- YES, YOU DID.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.650
- I WAS THE PRODUCT
OF DIVINE INTERVENTION.

09:53.690 --> 09:55.555
- WRONG. YOU'RE DEAD.
- RAISED BY WATER BEARS?

09:55.590 --> 09:57.182
- CAN WE AT LEAST
ATTEMPT A WOMAN'S NAME?

09:57.230 --> 09:58.322
GLEN? MULVA?
- WRONG. WRONG.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.691
- ROLLERGIRL?
- WRONG.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.254
- STARCHILD?
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.222
HAVE YOU EVEN READ THE FILE?
- PARTS OF IT.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.124
- WHICH PARTS?
- THE PARTS THAT SAY "BOOBS."

10:05.170 --> 10:07.297
- IT DOESN'T SAY "BOOBS"
ANYWHERE IN THE FILE!

10:07.340 --> 10:08.739
ALL RIGHT.
[clears throat]

10:08.770 --> 10:10.806
WHERE WERE YOU BORN?
- CROSSFIRE HURRICANE.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.172
- THAT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.701
- ON THE STEPS OF THE
PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF ART,

10:15.740 --> 10:18.777
AT DAWN,
IN A GREY TRACK SUIT, JACK.

10:18.810 --> 10:21.313
- THAT WAS ROCKY BALBOA.
- HMM.

10:21.350 --> 10:22.817
[English accent]
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS WHY

10:22.850 --> 10:24.715
I WAS THINKING OF PUNCHING
DEAD ANIMAL CARCASSES.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.615
- WHY ARE YOU USING
AN ENGLISH ACCENT?

10:26.660 --> 10:28.184
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
FROM PHILADELPHIA.

10:28.220 --> 10:28.982
[Shawn snaps fingers]
ALL RIGHT.

10:29.020 --> 10:31.250
WHEN WERE YOU LAST ARRESTED?

10:31.290 --> 10:32.587
WHERE DID YOU SERVE TIME?

10:32.630 --> 10:33.995
HOW MANY--EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

10:34.030 --> 10:35.793
- YES?

10:35.830 --> 10:36.819
- HOW IS IT THAT HE KNOWS
THE ANSWERS AND YOU DON'T?

10:36.870 --> 10:39.521
- I'M A SYMPATHETIC LEARNER.

10:39.570 --> 10:42.232
- ALL RIGHT.

10:42.270 --> 10:43.601
LET'S START
WITH THE SIMPLEST QUESTION.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.858
WHAT STATE IS PHILADELPHIA IN?

10:45.910 --> 10:48.003
- HELLO.
- HELLO?

10:48.040 --> 10:49.439
- WRONG. YOU'RE DEAD.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.209
THIS IS HOPELESS.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.274
WE HAVE NINE HOURS
UNTIL THE MEETING.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.346
WE NEED A NEW APPROACH.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.180
PLEASE STOP PLAYING
WITH THE EARPIECE.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.756
IT'S VERY ANNOYING.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.712
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S REVIEW.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.648
DO NOT SPEAK

11:03.690 --> 11:05.180
UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

11:05.230 --> 11:06.583
DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT.

11:06.630 --> 11:08.222
JUST FIND OUT THE LOCATION

11:08.260 --> 11:09.249
OF THE JOB
AND GET OUT OF THERE.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.392
WE'LL HAVE A VISUAL ON YOU

11:10.430 --> 11:14.491
IN FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO--

11:14.540 --> 11:16.496
GOOD GOD,
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

11:16.540 --> 11:19.668
- I HIT A VANTAGE STORE THIS
MORNING, AND I FEEL UNSTOPPABLE.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.473
- TAKE OFF THAT RIDICULOUS HAT.

11:21.510 --> 11:22.704
- YEP.
OVERKILL.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.706
- AND THE JACKET.
- I CAN'T.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.672
IT'S SIGNED BY BURT REYNOLDS,
AND IT MATCHES MY GLOVES.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.517
- WHICH GLOVES?
- THE GLOVES

11:28.550 --> 11:29.812
THAT WINSTON GOT FOR ME.

11:29.850 --> 11:31.442
YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:32.820 --> 11:35.618
- HE TOLD ME YOU APPROVED IT.

11:35.660 --> 11:37.787
- CAN WE KEEP THIS MOVING?
THE ONLY REASON WHY I'M HERE

11:37.830 --> 11:38.888
IS BECAUSE
I HAVE A POTTERCON EVENT

11:38.930 --> 11:40.591
IN 25 MINUTES FROM NOW,

11:40.630 --> 11:42.325
AND I PROMISED
MY LOCAL POTTERHEADS

11:42.360 --> 11:43.827
THAT I'D BE RETURNING
WITH A PICTURE

11:43.870 --> 11:46.395
OF MYSELF AND RUPERT GRINT
POSSIBLY POTTERING.

11:46.430 --> 11:48.193
- WHAT ON EARTH IS POTTERING?

11:48.240 --> 11:49.639
- YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU
JUMP OFF SOMETHING HIGH

11:49.670 --> 11:51.433
WITH A BROOM AND SNAP
A PICTURE IN MIDAIR.

11:51.470 --> 11:53.870
YOU APPEAR TO BE FLYING.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.671
WHAT THE--
- ALL RIGHT.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.302
I AM NOW IN
THE BLOODY BUCKET PUB.

11:59.350 --> 12:00.669
[sniffs]

12:00.720 --> 12:03.245
IT SMELLS VAGUELY OF SAUSAGE.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.679
I SUSPECT SOMEONE HERE
IS BOILING CABBAGE.

12:05.720 --> 12:06.914
- ASK HIM WHAT KIND OF CABBAGE.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.417
- YES, JUST STOP TALKING.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.451
- I AM STOPPING TALKING.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.458
- LOOK, THE RUPERT GRINT
MEET-AND-GREET

12:13.500 --> 12:15.491
IS LESS THAN A 1/2 KILOMETER
FROM HERE.

12:15.530 --> 12:18.624
SO IF SHAWN SIMPLY ASKS WHERE
THE JOB IS RIGHT OFF THE TOP,

12:18.670 --> 12:21.798
THEN MAYBE WE COULD--

12:23.540 --> 12:25.167
HOLY MOLY.

12:25.210 --> 12:26.165
- WHAT?
- THAT'S HIM!

12:26.210 --> 12:27.438
- WHO?
- RUPERT GRINT.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.040
THAT'S GRINT.
- WHERE?

12:30.080 --> 12:30.842
- OH, MY GOSH.
- WHAT? WHO?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.609
- HOW DO I GET OUT OF HERE?

12:32.650 --> 12:34.538
- WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:34.580 --> 12:36.343
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE A SURVEILLANCE VAN.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.780
NO ONE'S SUPPOSED TO LEAVE
A SURVEILLANCE VAN.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.380
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
HAVE YOU SEEN RUPERT GRINT?

12:41.420 --> 12:43.024
HE'S, LIKE, THIS HIGH.
LIKE, ABOUT THIS HIGH.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.789
RED HAIR? YOU SURE?
HE WAS WALKING THIS WAY.

12:44.830 --> 12:45.956
YOU COULDN'T MISS HIM.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.359
- [claps]

12:54.440 --> 12:55.930
- TAKE A SEAT, FINO.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.858
- SORRY I'M LATE.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.935
- LISTEN UP,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.175
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

13:06.650 --> 13:09.949
SOMEBODY HAS BEEN TALKING
TO PEOPLE THEY SHOULDN'T.

13:14.390 --> 13:17.257
PARKEY, A WORD.

13:25.870 --> 13:28.361
- [sighs]

13:30.310 --> 13:31.607
HA.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.507
- DON'T SPEAK.
DON'T SPEAK.

13:34.540 --> 13:38.306
DON'T SPEAK.
DON'T SPEAK.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.341
DON'T SPEAK.
OH, PLEASE DON'T SPEAK.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.985
PLEASE, DON'T SPEAK.
DON'T SPEAK, DON'T SPEAK.

13:43.020 --> 13:45.488
DON'T SPEAK, DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.408
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!

13:47.460 --> 13:49.587
- SO...
- DON'T SPEAK. DON'T SPEAK.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.655
- DEER-DA.

13:50.690 --> 13:53.295
- DIERDRE.
- DEER-DEE.

13:53.330 --> 13:54.592
- DIERDRE.
- THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

13:54.630 --> 13:57.326
HOW'S THAT SPELLED?
- D-I-E--

13:57.370 --> 13:59.668
[gunshot]

14:02.340 --> 14:05.309
JOB DONE.

14:05.340 --> 14:08.537
- ALL RIGHT, SHAWN,
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.741
JUST FIND OUT THE LOCATION OF
THE HEIST AND GET OUT OF THERE.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.475
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

14:12.510 --> 14:14.114
LET'S SAY WE GET
THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD, HUH?

14:14.150 --> 14:16.983
- JOB'S OFF.
KAPUT.

14:17.020 --> 14:18.112
- NO, NO, NO,
THE JOB CAN'T BE OFF.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.583
MAKE THIS HAPPEN, SHAWN.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.485
- NO. NO!

14:21.520 --> 14:23.579
I DIDN'T COME HERE
ALL THE WAY FROM CLEVELAND

14:23.630 --> 14:26.588
FOR THIS.
- I THOUGHT YOU WAS FROM PHILLY.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.825
- I DO.
I DO LIVE IN PHILLY.

14:28.860 --> 14:30.919
BUT I DON'T FLY OUT OF AIRPORTS
THAT START WITH "P."

14:30.970 --> 14:32.995
I KNOW, IT'S A SUPERSTITION,
BUT I HAVE SOME

14:33.040 --> 14:36.464
BECAUSE I GOTTA DO
WHAT MAKES ME FEEL RIGHT.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.058
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
I ONLY STAND

14:38.110 --> 14:40.829
FOR THE ENTIRETY
OF TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHTS.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.440
FIRST I TUCK IT
AND THEN I DO IT,

14:43.480 --> 14:45.948
AND THERE'S THE OCEAN.
- [laughs]

14:45.980 --> 14:49.177
- HE IS AS DAFT
AS WHAT THEY SAY, IN'T YA?

14:49.220 --> 14:51.643
- I'M DAFTER.
WHATEVER LEVEL OF DAFTNESS

14:51.690 --> 14:54.887
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
I'M DAFTER THAN THAT.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.059
- [laughs]
- I MEAN TO FINISH THIS.

14:57.090 --> 14:59.024
I MEAN TO SEE THIS THROUGH.
NOW LET'S DO THIS.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.994
- DO YOU NOT THINK
I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN?

15:01.030 --> 15:02.850
THIS JOB
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME,

15:02.900 --> 15:04.595
BUT WE'RE ALL ONE MAN DOWN.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.407
- WHAT?

15:11.440 --> 15:14.932
- NOT ANYMORE, WE'RE NOT.
I KNOW A GUY.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.732
- WHAT--WHAT--WHAT--WHAT
THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

15:16.780 --> 15:19.476
- HE'S BETTER THAN GOOD.
- WHO?

15:19.510 --> 15:22.775
- THEY CALL HIM...

15:22.820 --> 15:25.516
"THE WIZARD."

15:33.900 --> 15:36.460
- HEY.
WHY THE LONG FACE?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.092
- MAN, I THOUGHT
I SAW RUPERT GRINT,

15:38.130 --> 15:40.030
BUT IT WAS JUST
DUMB OLD PRINCE HARRY.

15:40.070 --> 15:41.560
- OH, THAT'S A BUMMER.
I'VE GOT SOMETHING

15:41.600 --> 15:43.101
THAT'LL TURN THAT
FROWN UPSIDE DOWN.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.960
COME INSIDE AND PRETEND
TO BE AN EXPLOSIVES EXPERT.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.659
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

15:46.710 --> 15:47.779
YOU MUST BE OUT
OF YOUR DAMN MIND.

15:47.810 --> 15:49.539
- WHAT IS THE BIG D?

15:49.580 --> 15:50.842
YOU'RE ALREADY PRETENDING
TO BE A SORCERER.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.609
- I AM PRETENDING
TO BE A WIZARD, SHAWN.

15:52.650 --> 15:54.709
GET YOUR FANTASY FICTION RIGHT.

15:54.750 --> 15:58.140
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
THE CREW IS A MAN SHORT.

15:58.190 --> 16:01.079
IF YOU DON'T DO THIS, RONNIE IS
GONNA CALL OFF THE WHOLE HEIST,

16:01.120 --> 16:02.985
AND YOU ARE GONNA BLOW
OUR SHOT AT BEING

16:03.030 --> 16:05.123
INTERNATIONAL CRIME-SOLVING
GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.196
- AH, YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU,

16:07.230 --> 16:08.822
BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE
THE OPENING HAT CEREMONY

16:08.860 --> 16:10.691
AND THEN THE HORCRUX
SCAVENGER HUNT

16:10.730 --> 16:12.061
AND THEN
THE QUIDDITCH TOURNAMENT.

16:12.100 --> 16:15.263
MY AFTERNOON IS BOOKED SOLID.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.790
- [English accent]
BOLLOCKS.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.637
DO THE JOB, GUS.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.479

SEXY BEAST ON ME.

16:20.510 --> 16:22.068

I WILL NOT.

16:26.350 --> 16:27.715
THERE'S A WAY.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.012
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW,
THERE'S A WAY.

16:29.050 --> 16:30.085
- THERE IS NO WILL,

16:30.120 --> 16:31.985
AND THERE IS NO WAY, SHAWN.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.681
- YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.017
I'M GONNA MAKE IT
REALLY EASY FOR YOU.

16:35.060 --> 16:38.188
WILL YOU DO THE JOB?

16:38.230 --> 16:41.393
- FOR THE LAST TIME, NO.
- TURN THE JOB YES!

16:41.430 --> 16:42.727

GRAMMATICAL SENSE.

16:42.760 --> 16:43.966
- YES! YES!

16:44.000 --> 16:44.989

17:04.520 --> 17:05.509
- PRETTY PLEASE DO THE JOB?
- THIS GUY.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.028
- SHAWN, WHY DOES THAT GUY
HAVE BLOOD ON HIS FACE?

17:12.060 --> 17:13.925
- BIRD FLU.
IT'S BIRD FLU.

17:13.960 --> 17:14.892
ALTHOUGH THEY CALL IT
GIRL FLU HERE.

17:14.930 --> 17:16.522
- NOPE.
- ALL RIGHT.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.596
SO THIS IS THE TEAM.

17:18.630 --> 17:20.689
OUR FEARLESS LEADER,
RONNIE IVES.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.061
THAT'S 'ARRY.

17:25.970 --> 17:27.904
'CAUSE APPARENTLY,
THERE'S NO "H" IN THIS LANGUAGE.

17:27.940 --> 17:30.340
AND LAST,
BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST,

17:30.380 --> 17:32.701
THE LOVELY AND EXQUISITE
DEE-DRA.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.047
- IT'S DIERDRE.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.570
- DIERDRE.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.687
- DIERDRE.
- DOODY?

17:42.720 --> 17:44.483
- DIERDRE.
- WE'RE MAKING A DOODY?

17:44.530 --> 17:46.157
- DIER...DRE.
- ONE MORE TIME.

17:47.930 --> 17:49.249
- DIER--
- JUST LEAVE IT.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.665
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET IT.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.588
LET'S MOVE ON.

17:52.630 --> 17:56.691
- AS PROMISED, TEAM,
I GIVE YOU...THE WIZARD.

17:56.740 --> 17:59.607
- I PREFER TO BE
CALLED "THE WHIZ."

17:59.640 --> 18:01.676
'ELLO, LOVE.

18:04.410 --> 18:07.174
- YOU DO THAT AGAIN,
AND I'LL CUT OFF YOUR HAND

18:07.220 --> 18:09.780
AND USE IT AS A DOILY.

18:09.820 --> 18:13.608
- YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ANY OTHER
MUCKER I'VE WORKED WITH.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.311
WHAT KIND OF JOBS
HAVE YOU PULLED, MR. WHIZ?

18:16.360 --> 18:18.885
- AS FAR AS MY EXPLOITS GO,

18:18.930 --> 18:21.649
LET'S JUST SAY WHEN I WAS 13,
I BROKE INTO THE MINISTRY,

18:21.700 --> 18:24.919
I FOUGHT OFF MOBS,
AND ONCE I EVEN GOT SPLINCHED.

18:24.970 --> 18:26.961
- [sighs]
- SPLINCHED?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.037
WHAT'S THAT?
- YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW.

18:30.070 --> 18:32.004
- RIGHT IN THE SACK.
- IT WASN'T IN THE SACK.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.873
- SHAWN, JUST FIND OUT

18:34.910 --> 18:38.038
THE LOCATION OF THE JOB.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.617
- SO, RONNIE, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE JOB, SHALL WE?

18:40.650 --> 18:42.914
WHEN IT'S GOING DOWN,
WHERE IT'S GOING DOWN.

18:42.950 --> 18:44.611
YOU JUST TELL US THE LOCATION,

18:44.650 --> 18:46.049
A TIME,
AND WHAT WE'RE WEARING.

18:46.090 --> 18:47.819
THOUGH I ASSUME
WE'LL ALL BE IN BLACK SINGLETS.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.885
MASKS OR NO MASKS?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.126
- I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THESE TWO, RONNIE.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.253
THEY SEEM LIKE
BLOODY IDIOTS TO ME.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.121
THEY DON'T HAVE
THE PROPER QUALIFICATIONS.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.958
- WELL, WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT
YOUR QUALIFICATIONS, DEANDRA?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.433
I MEAN, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH YOUR LIFE THAT'S SO DOPE?

19:00.470 --> 19:04.907
- I INFILTRATED
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE K42.

19:04.940 --> 19:07.829
- WELL, I GOT TO THE 12TH
SCREEN OF GALAGA

19:07.880 --> 19:09.336
WHEN I WAS, LIKE, SEVEN.

19:09.380 --> 19:13.009
- THE K42'S NOT A BLOODY
VIDEOGAME, YOU BERK.

19:13.050 --> 19:15.075
IT'S A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.611
WORKS EXCLUSIVELY
FOR BRITISH ROYALTY.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.789
- OH...

19:19.820 --> 19:21.412
- [slams hand]

19:21.460 --> 19:23.189
JUST HAVING SOME FUN.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.788
GOT SOME QUESTIONS
FOR YOU, THOUGH.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.024
- REALLY?
- HOW MANY CLOSETS DO THEY HAVE

19:26.060 --> 19:27.925
IN THAT BIG OLD PALACE?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.929
NO, NO.
WHICH CORGI IS THE HAPPIEST?

19:30.970 --> 19:33.996
- SOD THE ROYALS.
THEY LIVE A LIFE OF LUXURY,

19:34.040 --> 19:36.964
AND MY OLD MAN'S WORKED
ALL HIS LIFE DOWN THE MINES.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.969
I SAY THEY SHOULD ALL
BE THROWN IN THE SEA.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.739
- I DOUBT THAT'LL DO
ANY GOOD, RONNIE.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.509
YOU KNOW ALL THOSE RICH KIDS
GET SWIMMING LESSONS.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.642
- MM-HMM.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.611
- I LIKE HIM.

19:49.650 --> 19:51.880
[both laugh]

19:51.920 --> 19:54.013
- HE'S ALL RIGHT.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.585
- I'VE ALWAYS HAD A SOFT SPOT
FOR THE MAD ONES.

19:56.620 --> 19:58.929
BUT, LISTEN, DIERDRE'S RIGHT.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.928
WE GOTTA MAKE SURE
YOU BOYS ARE LEGIT.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.723
WE DON'T WANNA GET
TUCKED UP NOW, DO WE?

20:02.760 --> 20:04.762
SHALL WE MOVE ON?
- ANYWHERE YOU WANNA GO.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.893
- NO, NO, NO, NO, DON'T GO--
DON'T GO TO A SECOND LOCATION.

20:06.930 --> 20:08.534
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WH--OKAY.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.709
THEY'RE GOING.
START THE VAN.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.078
- SO WE'RE ROBBING A HOUSE, HUH?

20:24.120 --> 20:26.418
KITCHEN, SOUTH-FACING WINDOW?

20:26.450 --> 20:28.156
- VERY PERCEPTIVE, MR. FINO.

20:28.190 --> 20:31.921
BUT I'M ONLY INTERESTED
IN YOUR DRIVING SKILLS.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.599
[engine rewing]

20:38.000 --> 20:40.025
- I HATE TO BE
A PARTY POOPER, RONNIE,

20:40.070 --> 20:41.833
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE ALL
GONNA FIT IN THAT THING.

20:41.870 --> 20:44.202
- SO YOU GOT TWO MINUTES
TO COMPLETE THE COURSE.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.231
- THESE CONES REPRESENT, UH--

20:46.270 --> 20:47.976
- LAMP POSTS
AND LETTER BOXES.

20:48.010 --> 20:50.103
- RIGHT.
AND THE, UH...

20:50.140 --> 20:52.108
THE CUTOUTS.
- PEOPLE.

20:52.150 --> 20:53.879
- SURE.

20:55.550 --> 20:57.347
TWO MINUTES YOU SAY, HUH?

20:59.620 --> 21:01.019
THAT'S A PIECE OF PUDDIN'.

21:11.670 --> 21:12.625
- [whistles]

21:47.300 --> 21:48.938
- WHOO!
WHOO!

21:55.240 --> 21:56.798
[laughs]

22:04.050 --> 22:07.019
- YOU RAN EVERYTHING OVER.
TWICE.

22:07.050 --> 22:08.415
- YOU PAY ME TO DRIVE.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.884
SOMETHING GETS IN MY WAY...

22:11.930 --> 22:14.023
IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.219
- I LIKE HIM.
HE'S AS DAFT AS THEY SAY.

22:20.270 --> 22:22.363
YOU'RE IN.
- WHAT?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.800
- STILL NOT SURE
ABOUT YOU, THOUGH.

22:24.840 --> 22:25.932
- WHAT?

22:28.040 --> 22:30.031
- MAKE SOMETHING GO BANG.

22:30.080 --> 22:33.004
- UH, IT'S NOT THAT EASY.
- THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE.

22:33.050 --> 22:34.642
UH, FULL DISCLOSURE--

22:34.680 --> 22:36.819
THE WHIZ HAS
A LITTLE PERFORMANCE ANXIETY.

22:36.850 --> 22:38.181
OKAY?
IT'S CALLED E.D.

22:38.220 --> 22:39.289
- WHAT?
- IT'S A REAL THING.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.356
EXPLOSIVES DYSFUNCTION.

22:41.390 --> 22:43.449
YOU REMEMBER STEVE SAX, ANYBODY?

22:43.490 --> 22:46.220
ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE MUNITIONS
EXPERTS SUFFERS FROM IT.

22:46.260 --> 22:48.091
- I'D BE HAPPY TO COME BACK
WITH SOMETHING FOR YOU TOMORROW.

22:48.130 --> 22:49.495
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

22:49.530 --> 22:52.863
ARE YOU TWO TRYING
TO GIVE US THE SWERVE?

22:52.900 --> 22:54.561
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HE JUST SAID.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.739
- YEAH, THAT'S JUST
GIBBERISH, RONNIE. WHAT--

22:56.770 --> 22:58.203
- OI, BOSS.
- WHAT?

22:58.240 --> 23:00.265
- WHAT'S THAT?
LOOK.

23:00.310 --> 23:03.108
THAT LOOKS LIKE
A LISTENING DEVICE.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.244
- IT'S A WIZARD'S WAND.
- GIVE ME THAT.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.599
- IT BETTER BE.

23:06.650 --> 23:09.073
OTHERWISE YOU TWO ARE DEAD.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.216
- WHAT'S THE PLAN?

23:12.250 --> 23:13.319
WHAT DO YOU GOT,
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

23:13.350 --> 23:14.988
WHAT ARE THOSE, POP ROCKS?

23:15.020 --> 23:16.112
YOU'RE GONNA THROW
POP ROCKS AT 'EM?

23:16.160 --> 23:17.081
- NO, IT'S FLOO POWDER.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.621
- WHAT DOES IT DO?

23:18.660 --> 23:20.252
- IT MAKES A SMOKE CLOUD
SO WE CAN RUN FOR IT.

23:20.290 --> 23:22.793
- OH, NICE.
- EXPECT O PATRONUM!

23:22.830 --> 23:23.865
[weak pop]

23:30.840 --> 23:32.762
- IS THAT IT?

23:33.940 --> 23:35.771
[loud explosion]

23:35.810 --> 23:37.129
- BLOODY 'ELL!

23:42.080 --> 23:44.446
- HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

23:44.490 --> 23:47.141
- EXPECTO. PATRONUM.

23:51.990 --> 23:53.082
- WINSTON!

23:53.130 --> 23:54.392
WINSTON.

23:54.430 --> 23:56.398
WINSTON.
DUDE.

23:56.430 --> 23:57.988
- I'M SURE YOU HEARD WHAT
WENT DOWN AT THE WAREHOUSE.

23:58.030 --> 23:59.429
- HE BLEW UP A TRASH CAN.

23:59.470 --> 24:01.290
STALEY REALLY SAVED
OUR CRUMPETS OUT THERE.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.228
- MR. STALEY IS
IN A MEETING AT THE MOMENT.

24:03.270 --> 24:04.362
HE ASKED THAT YOU WAIT.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.162
HE'S VERY UPSET WITH YOU.

24:06.210 --> 24:07.472
YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING
HE ASKED YOU NOT TO DO.

24:07.510 --> 24:08.499
- WELL, COULD YOU TELL HIM
TO HURRY UP?

24:08.540 --> 24:10.132
BECAUSE SOME OF US

24:10.180 --> 24:12.546
NEED TO BREAK
INTO MR. IVES' OFFICE.

24:12.580 --> 24:14.468
- WHAT?
- I STOLE RONNIE'S KEY CARD

24:14.520 --> 24:16.408
WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO SHOOT YOU
IN THE FACE.

24:16.450 --> 24:17.519
HEY.

24:17.550 --> 24:18.517
- I DON'T KNOW HOW

24:18.550 --> 24:20.415
YOU AMERICANS OPERATE,

24:20.450 --> 24:22.054
BUT HERE WE FOLLOW PROTOCOL.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.388
NOW MR. STALEY
IS IN CHARGE OF THIS CASE,

24:24.430 --> 24:27.820
AND YOU WILL DO NOTHING
UNLESS HE AUTHORIZES IT FIRST.

24:27.860 --> 24:30.192
- FAIR ENOUGH.

24:30.230 --> 24:31.629
WE'RE ACTUALLY
PRETTY JEALOUS OF YOU, MAN.

24:31.670 --> 24:33.092
GETTING TO WORK
WITH HIM ALL THE TIME,

24:33.130 --> 24:34.688
SOLVING CRIMES,
EATING MEAT PIES.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.367
- ACTUALLY, I'M NOT JEALOUS
AT ALL.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.335
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,
I NEVER FULLY TRUSTED THE MAN.

24:39.370 --> 24:41.634
- ACTUALLY, I'VE ONLY BEEN
WORKING FOR ROY A SHORT TIME.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.547
I SCARCELY KNOW HIM.
AND I'M A VEGETARIAN.

24:44.580 --> 24:46.343
- WAIT, YOU DON'T KNOW STALEY?
- YOU EAT PIES

24:46.380 --> 24:48.245
WITH NO MEAT IN THEM?

24:48.280 --> 24:51.408
- LIKE THE REST, I CAME IN
WHEN THE STAFF TURNED OVER.

24:51.450 --> 24:54.317
THE TRUTH IS,
NO ONE AROUND HERE KNOWS ROY.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.409
- DO YOU HEAR THAT, SHAWN?
NO ONE KNOWS STALEY.

24:57.460 --> 24:59.087
- OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE KNOWS HIM.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.155
I MEAN, WHO HIRED HIM?
- WIM STUWESANT.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.792
- AHA! THE DUTCHMAN.

25:02.830 --> 25:04.559
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR
NON-DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES

25:04.600 --> 25:06.227
REGARDING THE DUTCH.

25:06.270 --> 25:07.396
- HE'S A LEGEND AROUND HERE.

25:07.430 --> 25:09.193
- SEE THAT, GUS?

25:09.240 --> 25:11.561
STUWESANT IS A LEGEND
AROUND HERE, SO YOU CAN SUCK IT.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.202
- WE NEED TO TALK
TO THIS WIM STUWESANT.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.502
- HE NEVER COMES OUT
OF THE FIELD.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.974
I'VE NEVER MET HIM.
NO ONE HAS.

25:17.010 --> 25:18.341
- REALLY?

25:18.380 --> 25:20.940
CAN YOU EXCUS'FIMJhS/I ONE MOMENT?

25:22.720 --> 25:24.142
- DESPEREAUX
IS SETTING US UP AGAIN.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.646
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.146
- THE SITUATION IS EXTREMELY
SUSPICIOUS, SHAWN.

25:27.190 --> 25:29.078
ADMIT IT.
- THE ONLY THING I WILL ADMIT

25:29.120 --> 25:31.680
IS THAT THE BUBBLE AND SQUEAK
IS NEITHER BUBBLY NOR SQUEAKY.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.425
- ALL I NEED IS SPOTTED DICK.
- BE THAT AS IT MAY,

25:33.460 --> 25:35.257
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY
TO KNOW FOR SURE

25:35.300 --> 25:37.291
IF DESPEREAUX
IS ON THE UP AND UP.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.533
[line rings]

25:41.570 --> 25:43.629
- LASSITER.
WHAT DO YOU WANT, SPENCER?

25:46.210 --> 25:47.575
- HELLO, LASSIE.

25:47.610 --> 25:49.134
I NEED YOU TO RUN
A QUICK BACKGROUND CHECK

25:49.180 --> 25:51.569
ON AN INTERPOL AGENT
NAMED ROY STALEY,

25:51.610 --> 25:53.646
AND I NEED YOU TO DO IT
ON THE D.L.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.511
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU JUST WANT ME TO DROP

25:55.550 --> 25:57.541
EVERYTHING THAT I'M DOING
TO INVESTIGATE A MEMBER

25:57.590 --> 25:59.182
OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY

25:59.220 --> 26:00.346
AND KEEP IT ON THE D.L.?

26:00.390 --> 26:01.516
- YES.
YES, I AM.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.926
- THANK YOU.

26:09.300 --> 26:10.255
- [whispering]
STOP IT.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.197
YOU ARE ACTING LIKE AN ANIMAL.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.232
YOU ARE ACTING
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

26:17.270 --> 26:19.500
STOP IT.
- I AM HUNGRY.

26:19.540 --> 26:22.031
I'M HUNGRY, I'M HUNGRY.

26:27.480 --> 26:30.119
- NO. THAT BELONGS TO NIGEL!
- COME ON, SON.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.015
COME ON.
- THAT IS NIGEL'S.

26:39.630 --> 26:41.621
- ALL RIGHT,
I AM ON INTERPOL'S DATABASE.

26:41.660 --> 26:43.924
SEARCHING...

26:43.970 --> 26:45.392
NO.

26:45.430 --> 26:46.624
THERE IS NO ONE BY THAT NAME

26:46.670 --> 26:47.523
THAT HAS EVER
WORKED FOR INTERPOL.

26:47.570 --> 26:49.390
- WHAT?

26:49.440 --> 26:53.399
OKAY, TRY--TRY WIM STUWESANT.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.998
W-I-M.
HE'S A DUTCHMAN.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.031
- HANG ON.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.308
NO.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.079
NOT THAT EITHER.

27:00.110 --> 27:01.975
- THANKS.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.987
DESPEREAUX'S
SETTING US UP AGAIN.

27:10.620 --> 27:14.795
- DAMN IT!

27:14.830 --> 27:17.594
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
MR. STALEY IS AN IMPOSTER?

27:17.630 --> 27:20.838
- HIS REAL NAME
IS PIERRE DESPEREAUX.

27:20.870 --> 27:23.338
AND HE IS THE LAST OF THE FAMOUS
INTERNATIONAL ART THIEVES.

27:23.370 --> 27:24.906
- MM-HMM.
OUR THEORY IS THAT

27:24.940 --> 27:27.261
HE INFILTRATED INTERPOL
DURING THE STAFF TURNOVER,

27:27.310 --> 27:29.699
CREATED BACK STORY,
AND THEN FORGED DOCUMENTS

27:29.740 --> 27:31.241
SHOWING HE WAS HIRED
BY STUWESANT,

27:31.280 --> 27:32.542
KNOWING GOOD AND WELL
THAT DUTCH BASTARD

27:32.580 --> 27:34.275
WOULDN'T BE HERE TO DENY IT.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.776
- DESPEREAUX
KNEW THAT RONNIE IVES

27:35.820 --> 27:37.469
WAS PLANNING A BIG HEIST.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.511
SO HE USED
THIS AGENCY--YOUR AGENCY

27:39.550 --> 27:42.257
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS SO
THAT HE COULD STEAL IT FIRST.

27:42.290 --> 27:43.951
- I FEEL LIKE A FOOL.

27:43.990 --> 27:48.393
- WELL...
- WINNIE...LITTLE POOH MAN,

27:48.430 --> 27:49.852
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

27:49.900 --> 27:52.266
NOT OVER THIS.
NO.

27:52.300 --> 27:56.589
DESPEREAUX HAS HOODWINKED GUS
AND I ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.507
HOW'S THE SAYING GO?
FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON ME,

27:59.540 --> 28:02.179
FOOL ME TWICE,
WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN.

28:02.210 --> 28:04.576
FOOL ME A THIRD TIME AND...
WELL, THE SECOND TIME

28:04.610 --> 28:07.602
DIDN'T REALLY COUNT BECAUSE, I
MEAN, MAN, DIDN'T HE LOOK DEAD?

28:07.650 --> 28:09.743
- SHAWN, THAT'S NOT REMOTELY
HOW THE SAYING GOES.

28:09.780 --> 28:10.678
- I HAVE TO REPORT
THIS IMMEDIATELY

28:10.720 --> 28:12.449
TO THE SECRETARY GENERAL.

28:12.490 --> 28:14.117
- WINNIE, NO!
YOU MAKE THAT CALL,

28:14.160 --> 28:16.082
AND DESPEREAUX WILL DISAPPEAR
INTO THIN AIR.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.020
WE'VE SEEN IT.
MARK MY WORDS.

28:18.060 --> 28:19.925
- WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?
- WELL...

28:19.960 --> 28:22.758
GUS AND I CAME ALL THE WAY
TO THIS EXOTIC ISLAND NATION

28:22.800 --> 28:24.927
TO SOLVE AN INTERNATIONAL CRIME.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.790
AND THAT IS PRECISELY
WHAT WE INTEND TO DO.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.559
- UH, I CAME HERE TO DRINK
MY WEIGHT IN BUTTERBEER,

28:28.600 --> 28:30.261
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.734
- YOU ARE AN ANIMAL.
AN ANIMAL!

28:32.770 --> 28:34.431
WINNIE,
I'M ASKING YOU TO PLEASE

28:34.480 --> 28:37.278
GIVE ME BACK RONNIE IVES'
SECURITY CARD

28:37.310 --> 28:39.505
BECAUSE, MAKE NO MISTAKE,
DESPEREAUX MUST BE STOPPED.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.415
- [whispers]
DON'T DO IT.

28:41.450 --> 28:43.441
- AND THE ONLY MEN WHO CAN DO IT
ARE STANDING IN THIS ROOM.

28:43.480 --> 28:47.758
- UH-UH.
- ONE, TWO...THREE.

28:47.790 --> 28:49.712
ARE YOU IN OR OUT?

28:49.760 --> 28:54.220
- I SUPPOSE I COULD REMAIN QUIET
ABOUT THIS FOR A FEW HOURS.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.796
LOCK OUT HIS ACCESS.

28:55.830 --> 28:57.320
- THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT, MAN.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.497
YOU SEE THAT, GUS?

28:58.530 --> 29:00.020
THE BRITS AND THE AMERICANS

29:00.070 --> 29:02.595
FIGHTING ON THE SAME SIDE AGAIN.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.039
JUST LIKE WORLD WAR II.

29:04.070 --> 29:06.630
WELL, HEAR ME, GENTLEMEN.

29:06.670 --> 29:09.901
THIS TIME, WE'RE GONNA WIN.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.439
RONNIE?

29:15.480 --> 29:17.016
YOU HOME?

29:17.050 --> 29:19.314
RONE?

29:19.350 --> 29:22.319
TENDERONI, BABY.
[rapping on wood]

29:22.360 --> 29:24.851
COAST IS CLEAR.

29:24.890 --> 29:28.098
- SHAWN, IF RONNIE CATCHES US,
HE'S GONNA KILL US.

29:28.130 --> 29:32.021
- GUS, DON'T BE THE HOWLING 2:
YOUR SISTER'S A WEREWOLF.

29:32.070 --> 29:35.233
WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS FIGURE OUT
WHERE THE HEIST IS GOING DOWN,

29:35.270 --> 29:37.693
TURN IT OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES,
BECOME HEROES,

29:37.740 --> 29:39.537
GET KNIGHTED BY THE QUEEN,

29:39.570 --> 29:41.071
AND THEN SPEND
EVERY SINGLE THANKSGIVING

29:41.110 --> 29:43.476
IN SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY'S
SUBMARINE.

29:43.510 --> 29:45.375
- OR WE DON'T FIND ANYTHING
AND WE GET THROWN IN JAIL

29:45.410 --> 29:46.502
FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING.

29:46.550 --> 29:47.574
I'M TOO PRETTY TO GET LOCKED UP

29:47.610 --> 29:48.713
IN THE TOWER OF LONDON, SHAWN.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.570
- OH.

29:50.620 --> 29:54.511
LOOKS LIKE RONNIE'S POP
PASSED AWAY RECENTLY.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.482
- OH, WOW.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.078
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
HE'S SO ANGRY AND COCKNEY.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.690
- THAT IS DISGUSTING, GUS.
- I SAID "COCKNEY," SHAWN.

30:00.730 --> 30:03.028
- WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS FIND
YOURSELF A LADY BECAUSE--

30:03.060 --> 30:06.496
- THE K42
IS A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM

30:06.530 --> 30:10.591
THAT WORKS EXCLUSIVELY
FOR BRITISH ROYALTY.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.369
- SO WE'RE ROBBING A HOUSE,
HUH?

30:12.410 --> 30:14.970
DUDE, I KNOW WHERE
THE HEIST IS GOING DOWN.

30:15.010 --> 30:16.500
IT'S AT ONE
OF THE ROYAL RESIDENCES.

30:16.540 --> 30:20.579
WE GOTTA GET BACK
AND TELL WINSTON.

30:20.610 --> 30:26.344
OH, HELLO...'ARRY.
[chuckles]

30:26.390 --> 30:28.085
WHIZ AND I, WE JUST CAME BY
TO SAY HI TO RONNIE,

30:28.120 --> 30:29.519
BUT HE'S NOT HERE.
- SHUT IT.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.754
- OKAY.

30:30.790 --> 30:31.722
- I SAW YOU LIFT RONNIE'S KEY

30:31.760 --> 30:33.751
AT THE WAREHOUSE.

30:33.790 --> 30:34.996
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU TO SHOW UP.

30:35.030 --> 30:36.998
YOU GOT SOME NECK, AIN'T YA?

30:37.030 --> 30:38.918
TRYING TO STEAL FROM RONNIE.

30:38.970 --> 30:41.689
BLOODY PILLOCKS.
I SHOULD TAKE ME MOBILE

30:41.740 --> 30:44.265
OUT MY SKY ROCKET AND RING HIM
RIGHT NOW.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.562
- WHAT IS THIS MAN SAYING?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

30:46.610 --> 30:48.532
BUT I THINK HE'S ON TO US.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.639
- BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT,
AM I?

30:50.680 --> 30:52.648
- I DON'T KNOW.
ARE--ARE YOU ASKING ME?

30:52.680 --> 30:54.568
- IS IT RHETORICAL?
IS IT--

30:54.620 --> 30:55.644
- I'M SO CONFUSED
RIGHT NOW, HARRY.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.908
- WE'RE HAVING THAT KEY BACK.

30:56.950 --> 30:58.383
- SURE, SURE.

30:58.420 --> 30:59.512
UH...
- GIVE IT TO HIM.

30:59.550 --> 31:00.949
- YEAH.
- GIVE IT TO HIM.

31:00.990 --> 31:02.719
- THERE WE GO.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.684
- NOW I'M GONNA
KEEP THIS AS INSURANCE.

31:05.730 --> 31:09.598
THE PRICE FOR KEEPING ME MOUTH
SHUT IS YOUR SHARE OF THE HEIST.

31:09.630 --> 31:12.758
HOW'S THAT SOUND THEN?

31:12.800 --> 31:13.994
- YEAH.
- ABSOLUTELY.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.268
DON'T GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.063
- WHY NOT?
- YEAH.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.159
- ARE YOU SURE THE JOB
IS AT A ROYAL RESIDENCE?

31:19.210 --> 31:23.670
BECAUSE THERE ARE 154 OF THEM
THAT FIT OUR DESCRIPTION.

31:23.710 --> 31:25.849
- KITCHEN, SOUTH-FACING WINDOW.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.609
YES, I AM SURE, WINNIE.

31:27.650 --> 31:29.515
IT HAS A KITCHEN
WITH A SOUTH-FACING WINDOW.

31:29.550 --> 31:32.041
- WELL, THAT HELPS...A BIT.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.718
- WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, CAN YOU
LOOK UP RUPERT GRINT'S ADDRESS?

31:34.760 --> 31:37.809
- NO.
- DON'T BRING OUT THE WAND.

31:37.860 --> 31:40.488
- THERE YOU TWO ARE.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

31:40.530 --> 31:42.589
I'VE RUNG YOU NUMEROUS TIMES.
- THIS IS TRUE.

31:42.630 --> 31:44.564
FULL DISCLOSURE,
WE SNUCK OFF TO POTTERCON.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.465
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.592
IT WAS A MEET-AN D-GREET
WITH DINGLEBERRY.

31:47.630 --> 31:48.995
- DUMBLEDORE.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.735
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE FINDING OUT

31:50.770 --> 31:52.431
THE LOCATION OF THE HEIST,
NOT WASTING YOUR TIME

31:52.470 --> 31:54.631
AT A CONVENTION FOR SILLY
CHILDREN'S FILMS.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.069
- SILLY? THOSE MOVIES ARE A PART
OF YOUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY.

31:57.110 --> 31:58.543
- WE NEED TO DISCUSS

31:58.580 --> 32:01.378
OUR NEXT MOVE IN THE IVES CASE.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.978
MY OFFICE, NOW.

32:03.020 --> 32:05.488
- YEP, RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS WORK TIME.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.080
[phone vibrates]

32:11.660 --> 32:13.184
[clears throat]
UH, STALEY?

32:13.230 --> 32:15.221
- [sighs]
WHAT?

32:15.260 --> 32:16.750
- UH...
[chuckles]

32:16.800 --> 32:18.665
I KNOW WE'RE REALLY
PRESSING OUR LUCK HERE,

32:18.700 --> 32:20.190
BUT DO YOU THINK IT'D BE
POSSIBLE FOR GUS AND I

32:20.230 --> 32:22.369
TO DROP BY THE HOTEL REAL FAST
AND FRESHEN UP A LITTLE?

32:22.400 --> 32:23.867
- I'M STARTING TO SMELL
LIKE HAGRID'S DOG.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.458
- FANG.
- YOU KNOW FANG

32:25.510 --> 32:26.568
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO DUMBLEDORE IS?

32:26.610 --> 32:28.828
- I KNOW DOGS.
- ALL RIGHT.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.973
A 1/2 HOUR.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.010
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK. IF DESPEREAUX
COMES BACK LOOKING FOR US,

32:38.050 --> 32:40.712
YOU TELL HIM
THAT GUS GOT HIS BIG TOE

32:40.750 --> 32:42.684
STUCK IN THE TUB FAUCET,
BECAUSE THAT REALLY HAPPENED.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.449
AND CALL US AS SOON AS
YOU KNOW WHICH ONE

32:44.490 --> 32:45.957
OF THESE ROYAL RESIDENCIES
RONNIE'S TRYING TO HIT.

32:45.990 --> 32:49.027
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S GO.

32:49.060 --> 32:50.755
MAN, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING,
YOU DO STINK.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.722
WHAT IS THAT?
- NIGEL'S MEAT PIE WENT BAD.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.590
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR
SWIPING ANOTHER MAN'S MEAT.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.335
- I LIKE MEAT, SHAWN.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.737
- OH, COME ON.
WHAT IS THIS?

32:59.770 --> 33:02.671
ANOTHER DRIVING EXERCISE?

33:02.710 --> 33:04.143
WHEN ARE WE GONNA
DO THE JOB, RONNIE?

33:04.180 --> 33:06.842
- WHAT ABOUT NOW?

33:06.880 --> 33:09.144
YOU CAN DRIVE.

33:12.890 --> 33:14.858
COME ON.
COME ON, TEAM!

33:14.890 --> 33:16.448
LET'S ROCK 'N' ROLL!

NO. NO.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.761

CHUCK A LEFT.

33:33.810 --> 33:35.869
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT, RONNIE?

33:35.910 --> 33:37.775
IT DOESN'T LOOK--IT DOESN'T
LOOK VERY ROYAL TO ME OUT THERE.

33:37.810 --> 33:39.869
- THIS IS WHERE WE PICK UP
THE NEW MEMBER OF THE TEAM.

33:39.910 --> 33:42.071
- NEW? I THOUGHT IT WAS
A FIVE-MEMBER JOB.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.942
- IT IS.
WE HAVE A TRAITOR AMONGST US.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.788
- [laughs]
ANOTHER TRAITOR. WOW.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.617
YOU DON'T THINK MAYBE...

33:50.660 --> 33:52.582
MAYBE YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE
BIT PARANOID, RONNIE?

33:52.630 --> 33:53.949
JUST A LITTLE?

33:53.990 --> 33:56.959
- IT TURNS OUT
OLD PARKEY WAS LEGIT.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.968
I FEEL A BIT SORRY FOR HIM.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.197
NOW I WANT ALL OF YA TO TURN OUT
EVERYTHING IN YOUR POCKETS.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.804
NOT YOU, YOU PRAT!

34:09.840 --> 34:11.034
SORRY, TEAM.

34:12.980 --> 34:15.039

34:19.950 --> 34:22.510
AH, JUST AS I THOUGHT.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.484
- I CAN EXPLAIN.

34:25.530 --> 34:27.327
RONNIE.
- BET YOU CAN.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.851
TELL IT TO THE ROAD, 'ARRY!

34:29.900 --> 34:32.721

34:36.670 --> 34:38.809
- OKAY, WE'LL MEET
THE FELLA HERE.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.606
- UH, YOU SURE THIS
IS THE PLACE, RONE?

34:42.640 --> 34:45.108
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OURSELVES
A NO-SHOW, MAN.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.710
- YEAH, WE MIGHT
WANNA GET OUT OF HERE.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.539
- GENTLEMEN.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.252
DEER-DRA.
- IT'S DIERDRE.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.619
- RIGHT, STOP HERE.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.369
SPRAY THE CAMERAS.

35:07.930 --> 35:09.488
- OKAY, HOW THE HELL
DID YOU GET HERE?

35:09.540 --> 35:11.360
- THIS WAS YOUR PLAN ALL ALONG,
WASN'T IT?

35:11.410 --> 35:13.264
GET US IN THE JOB, SLIDE
YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

35:13.310 --> 35:14.732
AND THEN RUN OFF WITH THE LOOT.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.270
- OI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:16.310 --> 35:18.369
CUT THE ELECT RICS.

35:20.810 --> 35:23.176
- PLEASE, GENTLEMEN.
I HAD TO IMPROVISE.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.812
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED.

35:24.850 --> 35:27.216
WINSTON WAS HIDING
KEY INFORMATION FROM ME.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.252
DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME
THE JOB WAS ON.

35:29.290 --> 35:31.758
I'M HAVING SCOTLAND YARD
PICK HIM UP AS WE SPEAK.

35:31.790 --> 35:33.348
TERRIBLE SURPRISE.

35:33.390 --> 35:34.721
I'M SHOCKED, REALLY.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.661
- UH, DID WE JUST
GET WINSTON ARRESTED?

35:38.700 --> 35:40.327
- OR WORSE.

35:40.370 --> 35:43.464
- FORTUNATELY,
I HAD TIME TO SELL OUT 'ARRY

35:43.500 --> 35:46.435
AND RESURRECT DESPEREAUX
ONE LAST TIME

35:46.470 --> 35:48.404
TO CLEAN UP WINSTON'S MESS.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.431
- MAYBE HE MEANT WELL.
- YEAH, MAYBE HE REALLY THOUGHT

35:50.480 --> 35:51.708
HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING.
- YEAH.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.377
[phone tune]

35:56.780 --> 35:58.941
- HEY, I'VE GOT AN UPDATE
ON YOUR WIM STUWESANT.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.639
- GOD, PLEASE TELL ME
HE DOESN'T EXIST.

36:00.690 --> 36:02.248
- HE DOESN'T EXIST.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.451
BUT HE DID.
SOMEBODY COMPLETELY ERASED HIM.

36:04.490 --> 36:07.357
MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY WITH A
REALLY HIGH LEVEL OF CLEARANCE.

36:07.390 --> 36:08.891
MY GUESS IS
HE TURNED STATE'S EVIDENCE

36:08.930 --> 36:10.852
AND WENT TO GO PLAY
WITH THE LIMEYS.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.197
- SO THAT MEANS
ROY STALEY IS REAL?

36:12.230 --> 36:13.959
- I'M SORRY.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.231
IS THIS OPERATION INTERRUPTING
YOUR PHONE CALL?

36:17.270 --> 36:19.830
- LOOK, MAN, WE HAVE
A LOT TO PROCESS HERE.

36:19.870 --> 36:22.031
- WELL, NOW YOU'RE UP TO SPEED.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.707
DUE TO THIS WINSTON BACKSTAB,

36:23.740 --> 36:25.344
WE DON'T HAVE BACKUP
FOR A WHILE.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.541
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO
UNTIL THEY GET HERE?

36:27.580 --> 36:30.276
- WE DO THE JOB.
THIS WAY.

36:33.890 --> 36:35.653
- UH, SMALL PROBLEM HERE.
I DON'T ACTUALLY

36:35.690 --> 36:37.578
KNOW HOW TO BLOW UP
AN ELECTRICAL SHACK.

36:37.620 --> 36:40.453
- BUT, MY GOOD MAN,
YOU ALREADY HAVE.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.661
- DIERDRE, TAKE CARE
OF THAT INTERIOR GUARD.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.099
- RIGHT.

36:50.140 --> 36:51.767
- YOU MAKE SURE
THE BACKUP SYSTEM'S OFF.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.199
YOU TWO, I WANT YOU
TO WIRE UP THAT SAFE.

36:54.240 --> 36:57.038
I'LL BE BACK IN 90 SECONDS.
- CONSIDER IT DONE.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.877
- IF WE WERE SMART,
WE'D GET BACK IN THIS VAN,

36:58.910 --> 37:00.901
DRIVE,
LEAVE DESPEREAUX STALEY HERE.

37:00.950 --> 37:02.918
HE'S DONE IT TO US.
- COME ON, GUS.

37:02.950 --> 37:04.986
WE'RE JUST GONNA ATTACH A COUPLE
DUMMY WIRES TO THE WALL SAFE

37:05.020 --> 37:06.681
AND WAIT FOR THE CAVALRY
TO ARRIVE.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.415
- SHAWN, THIS BRIEFCASE
IS FULL OF CANDY.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.348
- WHAT KIND OF CANDY?

37:16.960 --> 37:18.427
THIS IS WEIRD.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.496
- THIS PLACE
HAS ALREADY BEEN ROBBED.

37:24.570 --> 37:27.368
UH, SHAWN, WHERE'S THE SAFE?

37:27.410 --> 37:30.538
- ALL RIGHT,
SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG HERE.

37:36.020 --> 37:39.012
OH, CRAP.
- WHAT?

37:39.050 --> 37:40.483
- THAT'S CALVIN DORCHESTER.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.420
HE'S BEEN DEAD
FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR.

37:45.460 --> 37:49.294
- WE'VE BEEN SET UP.

37:51.530 --> 37:54.499
- SOD THE ROYALS!
THEY'VE LIVED A LIFE OF LUXURY.

37:54.540 --> 37:58.658
MY OLD MAN, HE'S WORKED
HIS WHOLE LIFE DOWN THE MINES.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.598
I SAY WE THROW 'EM
ALL IN THE SEA.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.278
- GUS, THEY'RE FAMILY.
- WHAT?

38:02.310 --> 38:05.108
- RONNIE'S DAD DIED BROKEN
AND POOR, REMEMBER?

38:05.150 --> 38:06.742
THEN IN THE AFTERMATH,
RONNIE MUST HAVE FIGURED OUT

38:06.780 --> 38:09.510
THE FAMILY SECRET.

38:09.550 --> 38:11.984
- HE'S A DORCHESTER.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.352
- THIS ISN'T A HEIST, GUS.
- THIS IS AN ASSASSINATION.

38:14.390 --> 38:16.517
- ACTUALLY...
[gun cocks]

38:16.560 --> 38:18.187
IT'S A HEIST GONE WRONG.

38:18.220 --> 38:22.054
YOU TWO GOT KILLED
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.864
HE KILLED YOU WITH THIS.

38:24.900 --> 38:27.164
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.667
- NO. BUT IT WILL.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.736
- LISTEN, DIRTY--
- IT'S DIERDRE.

38:30.770 --> 38:33.102
HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO SAY?
- VERY.

38:33.140 --> 38:35.279
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON
FOR THE EXTRA "R."

38:35.310 --> 38:37.471
- AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU
TO KILL US RIGHT NOW.

38:37.510 --> 38:39.205
- OKAY, I GET IT, AND IT SUCKS.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.899
RONNIE'S DAD DIDN'T KNOW IT,

38:40.950 --> 38:42.269
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY PART
OF THE FAMILY BLOODLINE.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.187
- OI.

38:45.220 --> 38:47.279
- THAT'S RIGHT.

38:47.320 --> 38:50.187
AND THAT DEAD BASTARD CUT MY
WHOLE FAMILY ALL OUT OF IT.

38:50.220 --> 38:51.448
ALL THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OURS.

38:51.490 --> 38:54.857
BUT INSTEAD MY POOR OLD DAD

38:54.900 --> 38:57.221
HAD TO WORK HIS ASS OFF
DOWN IN THE MINES.

38:57.260 --> 38:58.420
- LET IT OUT, RONNIE.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.620
JUST LET IT GENTLY
COME OUT OF YOU,

39:00.670 --> 39:02.888
YOU KNOW, LIKE A SOFT SONG,

39:02.940 --> 39:04.760
'CAUSE WE'RE LISTENING.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.232
AND THEN LET'S FINISH
THE HEIST TOGETHER

39:06.270 --> 39:09.637
LIKE THREE GENTLEMEN
AND A LADY.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.571
- UNFORTUNATELY, THE ROYALS ARE
A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO KILL.

39:13.610 --> 39:17.774
NOW I NEED TWO TOSSERS TO TIE
THIS INVESTIGATION TOGETHER.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.117
- TOSSERS? I--
- I DON'T KNOW.

39:19.150 --> 39:22.085
- [mouthing words]

39:22.120 --> 39:24.759
- OH.
- SURE. SURE.

39:24.790 --> 39:26.519
_ THANKS FOR VOLUNTEERING,
BOYS.

39:28.930 --> 39:31.091
- DIERDRE,
WHEN YOU FINISH THAT,

39:31.130 --> 39:33.564
GO AND POP THE FRENCHMAN
AND PLACE HIM BY THE ENTRANCE.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.137
- I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

39:36.170 --> 39:38.559
- SHAWN, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

39:38.610 --> 39:40.066
- GUS, WOULD YOU RELAX?

39:40.110 --> 39:42.578
ANY SECOND NOW,
DESPEREAUX/STALEY

39:42.610 --> 39:45.044
IS GONNA SHOW UP WITH THE WHOLE

39:45.080 --> 39:47.002
OF THE INTERNATIONAL
POLICING COMMUNITY.

39:47.050 --> 39:48.244
THEY'RE GONNA STORM IN HERE,
AND THEY'RE GONNA SAVE US.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.577
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS KEEP STALLING.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.747
OR AS WIM STUWESANT WOULD SAY,

39:51.790 --> 39:52.848
[Dutch accent]
SHTALLING.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.209
- DUDE?
- YEAH.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.810
- WE REALLY HAVE TO STOP
TRUSTING THAT MAN.

39:56.860 --> 39:58.782
- SON OF A...

40:01.930 --> 40:03.158
OKAY, YES.
YES.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.997
THIS WOULD SEEMINGLY WRAP UP

40:05.030 --> 40:06.361
THE MURDER INVESTIGATION
OF POOR CALVIN DORCHESTER.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.664
TWO DEAD CRIMINALS COME IN.
BOOM.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.439
I GET IT.
SURE.

40:09.470 --> 40:11.199
BUT THERE IS ONE THING

40:11.240 --> 40:12.969
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT,
RONNIE.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.836
- NOPE.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.245
- AND HE'S NOT A WIZARD.
- WHAT?

40:19.280 --> 40:21.840
- WHAT?
- [laughs] I'M NO CRIMINAL.

40:21.880 --> 40:23.939
MATTER OF FACT,
I'M NOT EVEN CRAZY.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.880
AT BEST, I'M PLEASINGLY
ECCENTRIC.

40:25.920 --> 40:28.115
AT WORST, I'M INCORRIGIBLE
AND SOPHOMORIC.

40:28.150 --> 40:30.459
BUT RIGHT NOW I HAVE ALL
OF INTERPOL ON THEIR WAY HERE

40:30.490 --> 40:31.684
TO SAVE US.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.152
AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

40:33.190 --> 40:34.350
JUST CHECK HIS BRIEFCASE.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.550
YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.795
GET ALL UP IN THERE.

40:37.830 --> 40:39.559
YEAH.
- WHAT'S THIS?

40:39.600 --> 40:41.295
- CURLY WURLIES!
AND THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

40:41.330 --> 40:43.036
- I KNOW!

40:43.070 --> 40:43.934
- TOFFEE COVERED
IN CHOCOLATE, JACK.

40:43.970 --> 40:45.267
LIKE LITTLE CHAINS.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.732
- JUST ABOUT
HAD ENOUGH OF YOU TWO.

40:46.770 --> 40:48.909
YOU'VE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE.

40:48.940 --> 40:51.773
- I GOT SOMETHING REALLY COOL
TO TELL YOU, RONNIE!

40:51.810 --> 40:54.108
- OH!

41:00.920 --> 41:02.285
- DESPEREAUX'S BACK.
HE CAME BACK!

41:02.320 --> 41:04.720
STALEY CAME BACK.

41:42.430 --> 41:44.625
- IT'S BEEN EMOTIONAL.

41:44.670 --> 41:47.491
- DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO STALL?

41:53.170 --> 41:55.001
- YOU REALLY ARE ROY STALEY.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.133
- OF COURSE I AM.
- I'M NOT SURE.

41:57.180 --> 41:58.204
- OH, GUS, WILL YOU STOP IT?

41:58.240 --> 41:59.446
WE FINALLY KNOW
WHO THE MAN IS,

41:59.480 --> 42:00.606
AND HE'S BETTER
THAN HE EVER WAS.

42:00.650 --> 42:01.742
- SO WHAT ABOUT
THE BAG OF JEWELS

42:01.780 --> 42:03.179
WE SAW YOU WITH OUTSIDE?

42:03.220 --> 42:07.088
- STALEY.
MY OFFICE. NOW.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.815
- YES, SIR.

42:12.690 --> 42:14.794
- EXCUSE ME,
WHO WAS THAT BRAZEN FELLOW

42:14.830 --> 42:17.651
WITH THE CRYSTAL BLUE EYES?

42:17.700 --> 42:19.327
- I'M GOBSMACKED.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.736
THAT MUST BE WIM STUWESANT.

42:21.770 --> 42:23.237
GEE.

42:25.940 --> 42:27.999
- HOW DO YOU SAY "SUCK IT"
IN ENGLISH?

42:28.040 --> 42:30.076
- YOU JUST DID, SHAWN.

42:36.850 --> 42:39.580
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
STUWESANT SUSPENDED YOU.

42:39.620 --> 42:43.716
- MY DEAR BOY, I'M ONE OF HER
MAJESTY'S CIVIL SERVANTS.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.684
AND AS SUCH I MUST ACCEPT
THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONS

42:46.730 --> 42:48.595
WITHOUT COMPLAINT.

42:48.630 --> 42:50.552
- THAT'S NOBLE.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.568
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK
IT'S AT LEAST PARTLY OUR FAULT.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.465
I MEAN, IF WE TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING WE FOUND OUT,

42:54.500 --> 42:57.037
DORCHESTER MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE.
- ALTHOUGH NOT FOR LONG.

42:57.070 --> 42:59.459
I MEAN, HE WAS REALLY OLD.
AND EVIL-ISH.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.569
- DON'T FEEL GUILTY, SHAWN.

43:01.610 --> 43:04.272
I'D HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF ME
IF I'D BEEN IN YOUR SHOES.

43:04.310 --> 43:08.098
WELL, THIS BULLDOG IS THE LAST
OF MY CHATTELS.

43:11.890 --> 43:15.451
IF YOU BOYS EVER GET BACK
TO LONDON, DO LOOK ME UP.

43:15.490 --> 43:17.856
YOU'LL FIND ME TOILING AWAY
IN OBSCURITY

43:17.890 --> 43:19.380
IN SOME DREARY OLD OFFICE,
NO DOUBT.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.489
- HEY.

43:21.530 --> 43:24.556
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
- THANK YOU.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.659
- YOU'LL BE BACK ON TOP
IN NO TIME, DESPEREAUX.

43:26.700 --> 43:27.894
YOU'LL SEE.

43:27.930 --> 43:29.966
- MY NAME IS NOT DESPEREAUX.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.729
IT'S STALEY.

43:31.770 --> 43:34.307
ROYSTON CORNWALLIS STALEY.

43:34.340 --> 43:36.535
AND YOU CAN CALL ME CORY,
IF YOU SO WISH.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.229
- I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.
- FAIR ENOUGH.

43:38.280 --> 43:40.771
SHAWN.
BUZBY.

43:49.390 --> 43:50.880
- ADMIT IT.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.582
ONCE AND FOR ALL,
YOU MISJUDGED THAT DUDE.

43:53.630 --> 43:56.155
ROYSTON CORNWALLIS STALEY
IS A STANDUP GENTLEMAN.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.896
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YES, I DID.

43:58.930 --> 44:02.229
- WELL, I GUESS WE CAN FINALLY
GO TO YOUR POTTERCON THING NOW.

44:02.270 --> 44:03.897
- NO.
IT ENDED LAST NIGHT.

44:03.940 --> 44:06.431
BESIDES, ALL WE HAVE IS
ENOUGH CASH FOR A QUICK DRINK

44:06.470 --> 44:07.767
AND A TAXI RIDE TO THE AIRPORT.

44:07.810 --> 44:09.402
- BLOODY BUCKET?
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.032
- JOLLY GOOD.

44:11.080 --> 44:13.503
WELL, GUS, AT LEAST WE GOT
TO TAKE IN

44:13.550 --> 44:15.438
SOME OF THE SIGHTS
OF OLD LONDON TOWN.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.608
- UH, SHAWN, WE WENT
TO ONE PUB AND A WAREHOUSE.

44:18.650 --> 44:20.641
WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN
IN BRITISH COLUMBIA.

44:20.690 --> 44:22.282
WHAT THE--

44:22.320 --> 44:23.685
- ROOM TEMPERATURE, MY ASS.

44:23.720 --> 44:25.756
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

44:29.100 --> 44:30.692
- WAIT.

44:36.140 --> 44:38.597
OH, MY GOSH.

44:38.640 --> 44:42.371
DUDE, THAT'S THE DUTCHMAN.
- RUTGER HAUER? WHERE?

44:42.410 --> 44:45.379
- NO! WIM STUWESANT.
HE'S A FAKE.

44:45.410 --> 44:47.947
HE'S A HOMELESS DUDE WITH REAL
URINE STAINS ON HIS PANTS.

44:47.980 --> 44:51.541
- OR HE'S BACK UNDERCOVER

44:51.580 --> 44:53.741
AS A HOBO WITH FAKE URINE STAINS
ON HIS PANTS.

44:53.790 --> 44:55.519
- THAT MAKES NO SENSE, SHAWN.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.482
- BREAKING UP AN INTERNATIONAL
PANHANDLING RING.

44:57.520 --> 44:58.851
- COME ON, SON.
WE WERE SET UP.

44:58.890 --> 45:00.755
- OR WE WEREN'T.

45:00.790 --> 45:03.293
WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE TO BELIEVE?

45:03.330 --> 45:05.662
I CHOOSE THE LATTER.

45:05.700 --> 45:08.362
I CHOOSE BEAUTY.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.936
IT'S JUST LIKE LIFE OF PI.

45:09.970 --> 45:11.528
- IT'S NOTHING
LIKE THE LIFE OF PI.

45:11.570 --> 45:15.472
- WHICH MAKES YOU THE TIGER,
RICHARD PARKER.
