<i>did you see that caption</i>

00:19.623 --> 00:22.158
<i>underneath the photo of me</i>
<i>from the hennessy fundraiser?</i>

00:22.192 --> 00:24.226
"who's the real first lady?"
sexist bullshit.

00:24.261 --> 00:25.594
can't get drawn into it.

00:25.662 --> 00:28.197
comparing our clothing
budgets and our stylists--

00:28.231 --> 00:29.565
like that's all
we care about?

00:29.599 --> 00:33.436
and that mark rivera
called me a diva
in his column.

00:33.503 --> 00:35.371
stupid fucking midget.

00:35.405 --> 00:37.373
clearly he hasn't
heard you sing.

00:37.407 --> 00:38.774
the guy's a dick.

00:38.842 --> 00:40.676
hey, gary, did you
find me a dog yet?

00:40.710 --> 00:42.778
yeah, i selected
a few candidates.

00:42.813 --> 00:44.580
or should i say
canine-didates?

00:44.614 --> 00:46.048
<i>no, you shouldn't</i>
<i> say that.</i>

00:46.049 --> 00:47.683
- let me s.
- what do you think of that?

00:47.717 --> 00:49.185
- a terrier?
- yeah.

00:49.219 --> 00:52.721
noay.
a rrier is a diva dog.
forget it.

00:52.756 --> 00:56.125
i don't need a ball of yappy
hair shitting its body weight
every 30 minutes.

00:56.159 --> 00:57.860
do you want a cat?
i can get you a cat.

00:57.928 --> 00:59.995
no, no.
i feel like a bad mom,
you know?

01:00.030 --> 01:02.731
'cause i never let catherine
get a dog when she was little.

01:02.766 --> 01:04.300
this is a fresh
start for us.

01:04.334 --> 01:05.801
it's parental ground zero.

01:05.836 --> 01:07.870
oh, wow.

01:07.871 --> 01:09.672
look at this.

01:09.706 --> 01:12.108
20 years in d.c.
congratulations.

01:12.142 --> 01:14.643
- thank you.
- i didn't think you guys
would eat the pineapple.

01:14.678 --> 01:16.112
listen, you're a dog
person, right?

01:16.146 --> 01:18.514
- what kind of dog
do you have?
- i have a real dog.

01:18.548 --> 01:20.483
- uh-huh.
- simon, black labrador.

01:20.517 --> 01:22.852
<i>simon?</i>
<i>what an unbelievable name.</i>

01:22.886 --> 01:25.087
i guess he just looked
like a simon.

01:25.122 --> 01:26.388
go on, get
the photo out, mike.

01:26.423 --> 01:28.057
i don't think we need
to see the photo.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.525
oh, i'd love
to see a photo.

01:29.559 --> 01:31.360
- sure.
- let me see.

01:31.394 --> 01:34.864
- such a shiny coat, no?
- how do you get that coat
so shiny, mike?

01:34.898 --> 01:37.333
uh, keep him hydrated.
lots of water.

01:37.367 --> 01:40.569
- you know?
- to drink or applied
directly to the coat?

01:40.637 --> 01:42.505
ha! leave my fake
dog alone.

01:42.539 --> 01:43.973
you know,
i was just thiirg,

01:44.007 --> 01:46.308
maybe we should get
a rescue dog 'cause
it'll play great.

01:46.343 --> 01:49.545
as long as it's not
one of those animals with
three legs and a wheel.

01:49.579 --> 01:51.947
- yeah.
- four legs good;
three legs bad.

01:51.982 --> 01:55.251
- i got it.
- whassup, as they say
in the late '90s?

01:55.318 --> 01:58.120
hey, jonah.
did the president cancel
the chinese premier

01:58.155 --> 02:00.356
- to come to my 20th party?
- no, ma'am.

02:00.390 --> 02:02.291
although i'm sure he wouldn't
miss it for the world

02:02.325 --> 02:05.194
- if it weren't for the fact
that he runs the world.

02:05.228 --> 02:08.464
i'm sure his absence has
nothing to do with your rift
with the first lady.

02:08.497 --> 02:12.201
what?
there is no rift.

02:12.235 --> 02:14.036
it was one tiny,
little disagreement

02:14.070 --> 02:16.338
and everyone's making it out
like we had a catfight

02:16.373 --> 02:18.073
in the map room
or something.

02:18.108 --> 02:19.442
she'd be a rough
fighter, though.

02:19.476 --> 02:21.444
she's got big shoulders.
those aren't pads.

02:21.478 --> 02:23.679
oh, ma'am, potus also
wanted to know when you
would be announcing

02:23.713 --> 02:26.081
the oil guy
that's gonna be going on
the clean jobs task force.

02:26.116 --> 02:29.218
- this bozo mike's on it.
- so today? tomorrow?

02:29.252 --> 02:31.954
- blink if you
understand me, mike.
- ha ha.

02:31.988 --> 02:34.290
and as regards to the rift
rumors, i'll keep my ear
to the ground for you.

02:34.324 --> 02:36.759
be careful your ears
don't pop on the way down.

02:36.793 --> 02:38.227
okay, can everybody
come in here, please?

02:38.261 --> 02:39.795
- sure.
- come on.

02:39.830 --> 02:41.530
right, we're gonna have
to shut down this story

02:41.565 --> 02:43.065
about me
and the first lady.

02:43.099 --> 02:45.201
i mean, it means we're gonna
have to undiva my party.

02:45.235 --> 02:47.670
we're gonna have to lose
those huge photos of me.

02:47.704 --> 02:49.405
- no, i like those.
- i know, they're great photos.

02:49.439 --> 02:51.240
i know, but there's no way
we can have them.

02:51.274 --> 02:53.909
- it's a good idea. we don't
want you to look like--
- stalin.

02:53.944 --> 02:55.578
i was gonna say
eva peron.

02:55.612 --> 02:58.080
yeah, i prefer that comparison.
less of a mustache.

02:58.115 --> 03:00.116
and you know what, actually?
she was kind of chic.

03:00.150 --> 03:02.118
- gorgeous.
- mm-hmm, looks like madonna.

03:02.152 --> 03:03.786
yeah. hmm.

03:03.820 --> 03:06.889
uh, mike, have you
announced chuck yet?

03:06.923 --> 03:08.858
- i'm still
working on it, amy.
- oh, come on.

03:08.892 --> 03:10.993
- this is not the hoover dam.
- yeah, it is the hoover dam...

03:11.061 --> 03:12.228
filled with shit.

03:12.262 --> 03:14.196
and when we announce
chuck furnham, an ex-oil guy,

03:14.231 --> 03:15.664
on the clean jobs task force,

03:15.665 --> 03:17.833
do you know what happens
with all that shit, amy?

03:17.834 --> 03:21.470
uh, does it get used in
a clumsy and unpleasant
analogy by you?

03:21.505 --> 03:24.206
look, amy, oil already
hates me 'cause we're
closing their tax loopholes

03:24.241 --> 03:27.109
and making them pay
for cleanup, so now
i'm eating everyone's shit.

03:27.144 --> 03:29.478
i'm like the last guy in
a human centipede with this.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.013
and there it is.

03:31.014 --> 03:33.282
we just got to put
one guy on clean jobs.

03:33.316 --> 03:35.117
chuck's oily,
but he's not evil oily.

03:35.152 --> 03:37.820
- <i>he's ex-oil.</i>
- yeah, you put it out today.

03:37.854 --> 03:41.190
today? half of d.c.
is at senator reeves'
dedication ceremony.

03:41.258 --> 03:43.259
well, then you
put it out there.

03:43.293 --> 03:45.194
i thought it might
be disrespectful,
but you're right.

03:45.195 --> 03:48.430
he was rapey reeves.
when was that guy
ever respectful?

03:48.465 --> 03:52.401
okay, your daughter
gets here in two hours.

03:52.435 --> 03:54.203
god, today feels like
the perfect storm, doesn't it?

03:54.271 --> 03:55.838
yeah, hurricane selina.

03:55.872 --> 03:58.274
yeah.
uh-oh, wait a minute.

03:58.308 --> 04:00.342
does that exist,
hurricane selina?

04:00.377 --> 04:02.411
- oh, i don't--
- can we run a check on that?

04:02.446 --> 04:04.380
i'm binging it.

04:05.749 --> 04:08.083
too full.
dan and jonah out, please.

04:08.118 --> 04:10.886
and just so you know,
this is also what would happen
if we were in a lifeboat.

04:10.887 --> 04:12.521
you're not
gonna believe thÃ±#.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.657
selina is on
next year's list
of hurricanes.

04:14.691 --> 04:16.257
oh, shit!

04:16.293 --> 04:18.093
what if it hits
and we get headlines

04:18.128 --> 04:20.629
saying "selina causing
large-scale devastation"?

04:20.664 --> 04:23.299
people won't equate
you with a natural
disaster, ma'am.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.401
really, amy?
'cause i've met
some people, okay?

04:25.402 --> 04:27.036
real people,
and i've got to tell you,

04:27.070 --> 04:28.971
a lot of them
are fucking idiots.

04:34.511 --> 04:36.245
<i>oh, my god.</i>
<i>do you see this?</i>

04:36.279 --> 04:38.347
<i>the tor senaeves</i>
<i>recreation center.</i>

04:38.381 --> 04:40.683
did you know old
grandpa fumblepants
couldn't even swim?

04:40.717 --> 04:42.051
mm-mmm.

04:42.085 --> 04:44.286
he would just hang out
in the shallow end
and stare.

04:44.321 --> 04:46.555
- you know wha  his favorite st?

04:46.590 --> 04:49.091
- was it dick stroke?
- it was dick stroke.

04:49.092 --> 04:51.927
- oh, widow, widow, widow.

04:51.962 --> 04:54.363
- he was such a wonderful man.
- thank you so much, selina.

04:54.397 --> 04:58.200
oh, look at him here.
he is so happy.

04:58.235 --> 05:00.836
i'm sorry about your feud
with the first lady.

05:00.871 --> 05:02.605
oh, you know...

05:02.672 --> 05:04.607
is it true that she
stole your stylist?

05:04.641 --> 05:06.142
no. you know,
the newspapers just make--

05:06.176 --> 05:08.744
sorry, ma'am.
this is the president calling.

05:08.779 --> 05:10.579
- it just can't wait.
- oh. i have to take this.

05:10.614 --> 05:11.714
- will you excuse me?
- go ahead.

05:11.748 --> 05:14.517
hello? yes.
hi, mr. president.

05:14.551 --> 05:16.452
f.y.i., ma'am,
the president
is not calling.

05:16.453 --> 05:18.954
- f.y.i., gary, no shit.
- okay.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.960
- is chuck announced yet?
- i'm waiting for the perfect
time, okay?

05:24.995 --> 05:27.596
you are like a...

05:27.631 --> 05:30.466
earlobe--
you're just there,

05:30.467 --> 05:31.801
just wobbling.

05:31.802 --> 05:33.436
- doyle is right there.
- i know.

05:33.470 --> 05:34.737
- do it now.
- i will.

05:34.771 --> 05:36.372
- senator doyle.
- stop.

05:36.406 --> 05:39.108
- mike wanted a word,
if you don't mind.
- mike mcclintock.

05:39.142 --> 05:41.310
- you are well?
- yes, sir. very good, sir.

05:41.344 --> 05:43.612
oh, holy shit.
these mushrooms are amazing.

05:43.647 --> 05:46.148
- what is it, mike?
- must be ricotta or something
in there.

05:46.216 --> 05:47.950
- oh, that's funny.
- yeah.

05:47.984 --> 05:49.485
- goody, i love humor.
- yeah.

05:49.519 --> 05:51.821
- i have
a hypothetical for you.
- okay.

05:51.888 --> 05:55.291
wh would you say if
we announced chuck furnham
to the clean jobs task force?

05:55.325 --> 05:57.293
- furnham?
- yeah, chuck.

05:57.327 --> 06:00.095
well, that would be
a betrayal from the veep.

06:00.130 --> 06:01.664
not necessarily.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.400
so i imagine that
i would mix ape shit
with bat shit,

06:04.434 --> 06:06.168
raise it to a whole
new level of fury,

06:06.203 --> 06:08.037
then i'd probably
rip your face off

06:08.071 --> 06:12.274
and use your eye
sockets as a sex toy.

06:12.309 --> 06:14.677
it's just a hypothetical
like yours.

06:14.711 --> 06:16.312
chuck would
just be token oil.

06:16.346 --> 06:18.080
oil would think
he's their trojan horse,

06:18.115 --> 06:19.648
he'd be a hollow horse.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.684
noa hollow horse.
that's a trojan horse.

06:21.718 --> 06:24.019
he'd be a hollow
trojan horse, sir.

06:24.020 --> 06:26.455
i was promised
no one from oil.

06:26.490 --> 06:29.458
- chuck's not oil.
he retired a year ago.
- yeah, from oil.

06:29.493 --> 06:32.328
- now i fucking want to speak
to the vice president.
- okay.

06:32.362 --> 06:34.830
hurricane forecast
is looking good,

06:34.865 --> 06:36.999
and your daughter's
just arrived at the office.

06:37.033 --> 06:39.502
- great, that's our cue.
- hallowes, hurricane hallowes.

06:39.536 --> 06:42.805
- hi. hello.
- barbara. hello.

06:42.839 --> 06:44.807
i am so sorry,
senator hallowes.

06:44.841 --> 06:46.842
- the president is calling.
- oh, dear. i'm sorry.

06:46.877 --> 06:48.310
excuse me
just for one second.

06:48.345 --> 06:50.179
listen, while you take
your fake phone call,

06:50.213 --> 06:51.981
is it okay if i steal
dan for a second?

06:52.015 --> 06:53.749
or should i say
steal dan back?

06:53.784 --> 06:55.217
could you hold on
just one second?

06:55.285 --> 06:57.386
you know what?
actually, this phone call
is not fake.

06:57.420 --> 07:00.389
and dan is his own man.
he can go wherever he wants.

07:00.390 --> 07:03.025
- okay. this way, dan.
- i'm sorry to keep you
holding, mr. president.

07:03.059 --> 07:05.694
- you know who's a fucking diva?
that's a fucking diva.
- that one.

07:05.729 --> 07:09.165
- so how's college?
- it's good.

07:09.199 --> 07:12.201
you know, except for
the whole secret service
detail, i think i'm actually...

07:12.235 --> 07:14.303
- office of the vice president.
- ...starting to blend in.

07:14.337 --> 07:16.405
no, at lunchtime
she eats lunch.

07:16.406 --> 07:20.042
good-bye.
have you chosen
a new dog yet?

07:20.076 --> 07:21.710
what dog?

07:21.745 --> 07:25.080
your mom is getting a g.
apologies if that was a secret.

07:25.081 --> 07:27.016
- office of the vice president.

07:27.050 --> 07:30.853
you dumped my daughter by text
and didn't even apologize.

07:30.887 --> 07:34.523
oh, no, i did.
i signed off with
colon open brackets.

07:34.558 --> 07:37.993
listen, is selina really
trying to appease the oil
lobby with chuck furnham?

07:38.028 --> 07:40.296
i suppose chuck could
be viewed as a gesture.

07:40.330 --> 07:42.264
chuck is a gesture
all right.

07:42.332 --> 07:44.433
do you know what these
oil wise guys call him?

07:44.434 --> 07:47.369
they call him
"who the fuck is
chuck furnham?"

07:47.404 --> 07:50.072
chuck furnham's at 12:15.
now he's at 12:00.
now he's here.

07:50.107 --> 07:53.275
- madam vice president.
- chuck! how are you?

07:53.276 --> 07:55.778
i was promised movement
on the clean jobs.

07:55.812 --> 07:58.314
yes. between us,
we might possibly

07:58.348 --> 08:00.983
make your
announcement today.

08:01.017 --> 08:02.818
- yes. yes.
- yes. right.

08:02.853 --> 08:05.221
- fantastic.
- oh, my.

08:05.255 --> 08:06.755
- thank you, ma'am.
- and, you know,

08:06.790 --> 08:08.624
i've been thinking
ever since i saw them,

08:08.658 --> 08:11.460
- your grandchildren,
marion and...
- richard.

08:11.495 --> 08:15.197
yes, richard. and i have
some vice presidential m&ms

08:15.198 --> 08:17.099
that i would love
for them to have.

08:17.134 --> 08:19.335
you see the seal right there?
except we'll need another one

08:19.369 --> 08:21.170
because there are
two grandchildren.

08:21.204 --> 08:22.772
- i'm out.
- you're out?

08:22.806 --> 08:25.141
- i'm out.
- oh, hmm.
well, that's a shame.

08:25.175 --> 08:27.510
i don't know how
that happened. okay.

08:27.544 --> 08:29.545
- thank you so much.
- you're so welcome.

08:29.613 --> 08:31.680
wake up, dan.
this is oil.

08:31.715 --> 08:33.716
you nominate chuck furnham,
and these guys

08:33.750 --> 08:35.751
will fucking take
his head off with a shovel.

08:35.785 --> 08:37.553
selina needs to find
somebody else.

08:37.587 --> 08:39.221
i'm glad you
enjoyed yourself.

08:39.256 --> 08:40.589
carol hallowes, hi.

08:40.590 --> 08:44.493
oh, mrs. reeves,
i am so sorry for your loss.

08:44.528 --> 08:46.595
your husband
was a massive player.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.597
politically speaking,
of course.

08:48.632 --> 08:50.166
- i'm jonah.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.335
- i work at the white house.
- are you okay, ma'am?

08:53.370 --> 08:55.337
oh, i'm sorry.
i didn't even realize.
are you okay?

08:55.372 --> 08:57.339
would you please get me
a glass of water?

08:57.374 --> 09:00.276
you know what?
there aren't any waiters,
at least that i've seen.

09:00.310 --> 09:03.279
jonah, would you please
get her a glass of water?

09:03.313 --> 09:05.347
absolutely.
of course. of course.

09:05.382 --> 09:07.183
i guess all those tears
must be dehydrating.

09:07.217 --> 09:08.717
i don't think
it works like that.

09:08.752 --> 09:10.719
you know, i'll just
get the water, okay?

09:10.754 --> 09:13.656
cock-blocking widow.

09:13.690 --> 09:15.491
senator doyle went
"black swan" over chuck.

09:15.525 --> 09:17.293
he says we
promised him no oil.

09:17.327 --> 09:20.296
i implied to chuck
that we would announce today.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.765
shit. is he senile
enough to forget?

09:22.799 --> 09:24.200
- hey.
- hey, how was hallowes?

09:24.234 --> 09:26.235
"dan, hi.
i hate chuck furnham."

09:26.269 --> 09:28.938
- wait, what?
- yeah, she's predicting all
kinds of backlash from oil.

09:28.972 --> 09:31.273
how could oil
not like chuck furnham?

09:31.308 --> 09:33.342
- he's not oily enough.
- oh.

09:33.376 --> 09:35.811
unconnected. for all
the reasons that we loved
him, they hate him.

09:35.846 --> 09:40.716
okay, so now we have
two catch-22 situations
simultaneously.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.451
is there even
a name for that?

09:42.486 --> 09:44.353
- how about catch-44?
- gary.

09:44.387 --> 09:46.856
okay, i'm gonna run it
by an oil lobbyist.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.624
- sidney purcell
is right there.
- oh, good.

09:48.658 --> 09:51.160
- do that, amy. go.
- okay.

09:51.228 --> 09:54.063
ll, most of the party
photos need to be removed.

09:54.097 --> 09:55.865
i don't know.
use your instincts

09:55.899 --> 09:59.168
and your eyes,
then your hands and arms.
thank you.

09:59.202 --> 10:01.704
it's really nice that
my mom's getting a new dog.

10:01.738 --> 10:04.340
- i always wanted a dog.
- hey, catherine, you want
some more coffee?

10:04.374 --> 10:06.142
no, i'm still drinking
this one.

10:06.176 --> 10:08.077
you know, you don't
have to entertain me.

10:08.145 --> 10:10.546
- i'm cool with
mywn thoughts.
- oh, thank god.

10:10.580 --> 10:13.282
'cause i'm getting emails
like every other heartbeat.

10:13.316 --> 10:14.583
yeah.

10:14.651 --> 10:17.052
oh, hi, sidney.
how are you?

10:17.087 --> 10:18.554
oh, good.
you know, full of
free shrimp.

10:18.588 --> 10:20.756
hey, here's the thing--
clean jobs.

10:20.791 --> 10:22.758
clean jobs, yeah.
what's going on there?

10:22.826 --> 10:25.361
you guys got a name yet?
you too afraid

10:25.395 --> 10:27.997
of wrecking the earth's
resources to print up
a press release?

10:27.998 --> 10:29.965
i was actually gonna
run a name by you.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.769
of wrecking the earth's
don't say chuck furnham.
do not say chuck furnham.

10:33.804 --> 10:37.173
if you say chuck furnham,
i will go into anaphylactic
fucking shock.

10:37.207 --> 10:39.341
- i'm saying chuck furnham.
- fucking hell!

10:39.376 --> 10:41.510
are you kidding me?
chuck furnham?
that's fucking official?

10:41.545 --> 10:44.113
- chuck is oil.
- no. no, no, hey.
i'm sorry, no.

10:44.147 --> 10:47.216
he's not oil.
he's a fucking fossil,
but he's not oil.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.318
we need somebody
who is plugged in.

10:49.352 --> 10:51.987
the only thing that
chuck is plugged into
is his fucking piss bag.

10:52.055 --> 10:54.323
your comments are noted.

10:54.357 --> 10:56.292
- oh, good.
i love being noted.
- thank you.

10:56.293 --> 10:59.028
- he said fuck chuck.
oh-  god.

10:59.095 --> 11:01.630
okay, chuck is dead
and we're gonna just
have to keep him quiet

11:01.665 --> 11:04.133
because this whole place is
swarming with bored reporters

11:04.134 --> 11:05.935
who are on pervert
memorial duty.

11:05.969 --> 11:09.538
so your job, mike,
is to keep him
in your sight

11:09.573 --> 11:12.041
- until we find a replacement.
- okay, where'd he go?

11:12.075 --> 11:14.143
- he must be in the bathroom.
- that prostate of his.

11:14.177 --> 11:15.211
get in there, mike.
go.

11:15.245 --> 11:16.912
this in no way
will be demeaning.

11:16.947 --> 11:19.648
just pretend you're
picking him up, you know,
and he's blind.

11:19.683 --> 11:22.518
- mayday at 10:00.
senator doyle is approaching.
- sidney purcell, too, 5:00.

11:22.552 --> 11:25.488
hallowes is in quadrant
three right behind you,
right behind you.

11:25.489 --> 11:27.123
- we've got to
get out of here.
- widow walk.

11:27.157 --> 11:28.591
people don't shout at you

11:28.625 --> 11:29.959
when you're standing
next to the dead man's
grieng widow.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.228
- that's very good.
- mrs. reeves.

11:32.262 --> 11:33.762
dan egan, i'm with
the vice president.

11:33.797 --> 11:35.898
i just wanted to tell
you how much i thought
of your husband.

11:35.932 --> 11:38.601
well, thank you.
what a handsome young man.

11:38.635 --> 11:40.169
- quite the wilf yourself.
- you're back.

11:40.237 --> 11:42.905
yes, i'm back.
unfortunately we're
just about to leave.

11:42.939 --> 11:45.841
but if you could perhaps
walk the vice president
out to her car...

11:45.876 --> 11:49.011
delightful.
it will give us a chance
for some juicy gossip.

11:49.079 --> 11:50.846
- okay.
- now is it true

11:50.881 --> 11:54.717
that the first lady
calls you creepy veepy?

11:54.751 --> 11:57.753
- m very excited
about it. good-bye.

11:57.788 --> 11:59.855
<i>what are you excited</i>
<i>about, chuck?</i>

11:59.956 --> 12:01.624
are you the new face
of louis vuitton?

12:01.658 --> 12:04.360
have you been telling
people about your appointment
to clean jobs?

12:04.427 --> 12:08.063
what's the problem?
the vice president told me
it's as good as announced.

12:08.131 --> 12:10.232
=i
as good as announced
is not announced.

12:10.267 --> 12:11.600
you are as good as dead,

12:11.635 --> 12:13.869
but you're not
actually dead...
not yet.

12:13.937 --> 12:18.107
- okay, doyle and the party
hate me because of chuck

12:18.141 --> 12:20.643
and oil hates me
because of chuck.

12:20.677 --> 12:22.144
first lady hates you
usbecayou're prettier.

12:22.179 --> 12:24.180

we're talking about
right now, okay?

12:26.349 --> 12:28.951
i need time.
do i have time?

12:28.985 --> 12:30.786

- what do you want me
to telher?

12:33.990 --> 12:36.659

12:36.693 --> 12:38.294
there's nothing more
important than catherine

12:38.328 --> 12:41.063
because something more important
than catherine has come up.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.098

12:43.133 --> 12:46.502

a little meeting

13:26.209 --> 13:29.478

<i> that's right.</i>

13:32.082 --> 13:33.582

13:38.421 --> 13:40.389

yo mama's office.

13:46.496 --> 13:47.463

13:52.869 --> 13:56.338
experimental
theater course?

13:56.373 --> 13:58.808

13:58.842 --> 14:00.676
you can talk to him
about that.

14:00.710 --> 14:02.545
you can talk
about anything.

14:02.579 --> 14:04.647
- <i>anything.</i>
- anything.

14:04.714 --> 14:07.149
talk, talk, talk.

14:07.150 --> 14:10.920
now that we have the permission
to talk about anything...

14:12.856 --> 14:16.258
have you ever read
faulkner before?

14:16.293 --> 14:18.060
um...

14:18.094 --> 14:19.695
a ttle bit.

14:19.729 --> 14:22.131

14:22.165 --> 14:24.200
now what are
our options, mike?

14:24.234 --> 14:27.002
look, i don't know, okay?
it's like a fucking
rubik's cube.

14:27.037 --> 14:29.738
- i mean, it's impossible
at this point.
- what, mike?

14:29.773 --> 14:32.007
a rubik's cube is not
impossible to solve.

14:32.008 --> 14:34.009
i saw a chinese kid
do it in like 10 seconds.

14:34.044 --> 14:35.511
10 seconds, mike.

14:35.579 --> 14:38.214
let me just have
a deep think, okay?
i need some me time.

14:38.248 --> 14:40.583
just let me get deep.

14:40.584 --> 14:42.751
he's not wrong.
we are in a tight corner.

14:42.786 --> 14:45.554
- that's the nature
the job, i guess.
- ooh, i'm not complaining.p.

14:45.589 --> 14:47.690
i am glad to be
off dogs and hurricanes

14:47.691 --> 14:49.358
and back in a good old
washington shit storm.

14:49.359 --> 14:52.495
speaking of dogs,
what's happening
in that department?

14:52.529 --> 14:55.197
- i'm on it.
- okay.

14:55.265 --> 14:57.500
have you reached
a dog verdict yet?

14:57.534 --> 14:59.835
your mom said
your decision is final.

14:59.870 --> 15:03.105
- yeah, this one.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.374
yeah, it looks astonished.

15:05.442 --> 15:07.476
like it's attached
to jumper cables or something.

15:07.511 --> 15:09.912
- i think he's cute.
- okay, yeah. yeah.

15:09.946 --> 15:12.181
hey, guys.
honey, you've got
to change.

15:12.215 --> 15:15.184
or you're wearing that.
are you wearing that?

15:15.218 --> 15:16.652
yeah, i was planning
on it, unless--

15:16.686 --> 15:18.621
great. cool.
fantastic.

15:18.655 --> 15:21.423
can we have just
a quick second
to chat?

15:21.458 --> 15:24.059
- yes, sure.
- thank you.

15:24.060 --> 15:25.561
- oh--
- i will get out.

15:25.562 --> 15:28.497
um, amy, if i could just
talk to you for a quick sec.

15:28.532 --> 15:30.032
- oh, okay.
- if i could.

15:30.066 --> 15:32.802
- oh, yeah.
not a problem.
- thank you, darling.

15:34.438 --> 15:36.372
what is that skirt?
is it a rug?

15:36.406 --> 15:38.240
no, i don't think so.
i think they do that now.

15:38.275 --> 15:39.909
how is she?
is she good?

15:39.943 --> 15:43.379
well, you know, y-yeah.
she's her normal self.

15:43.413 --> 15:45.581
- really great.
- oh, good.

15:45.615 --> 15:48.517
so do we have a plan
to solve this rubik's cube?

15:48.552 --> 15:50.486
- i've been going over--
- <i>here's an idea.</i>

15:50.520 --> 15:52.455
we announce the dog.
it's soft wash,

15:52.489 --> 15:54.557
breakfast news,
but we tease it out.

15:54.591 --> 15:56.058
we say we're looking
for a name.

15:56.092 --> 15:57.760
an ocean of ideas
comes pouring in.

15:57.828 --> 16:00.596
meantime, we're buying
time to figure all
the other shit out.

16:00.597 --> 16:03.966
that's kind of
a great idea.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.803
okay.
- did she choose a dog?

16:09.239 --> 16:11.740
- woof.
- you got to be
fucking kidding me.

16:11.775 --> 16:13.509
i hate these animals.

16:13.543 --> 16:17.313
this thing is...
unbelievably cute.

16:17.347 --> 16:18.948
ma'am, senator doyle
just arrived

16:18.949 --> 16:20.916
and he has a face like
he's been stabbed in the groin.

16:20.951 --> 16:23.152
um, okay. i can't talk to him
'cause i'm with my daughter.

16:23.186 --> 16:25.287
- perhaps the widow walk?
- oh, the widow walk.

16:25.322 --> 16:27.156
- madam vice president.
- you're the widow.

16:27.157 --> 16:29.291
- come, honey.
- <i>why are you ignoring</i>
<i> me, ma'am?</i>

16:29.326 --> 16:31.093
we're gonna just pretend--
darling, don't turn around.

16:31.128 --> 16:32.928
- i've been here.
- just keep your head
towards me.

16:32.963 --> 16:36.265
just pretend like you're
talking seriously to me.

16:36.299 --> 16:38.167
- wait, mom, what's
wrong with your face?
- nothing, darling.

16:38.235 --> 16:40.436
- i'm pretending
to talk to you.
- <i>but we are talking.</i>

16:40.470 --> 16:42.638
<i>no, no, i mean,</i>
<i>it's a pretend...</i>

16:45.976 --> 16:47.843
i was given
your word, ma'am,

16:47.911 --> 16:50.846
that nobody
from oil was gonna
be on the task force,

16:50.914 --> 16:53.749
and now i've got
this chuck bullshit.

16:53.784 --> 16:56.719
andrew, this whole thing
is so nuanced.

16:56.753 --> 17:00.122
and i have a ton of interests
that i have to square--

17:00.157 --> 17:04.393
=]
20 years ago, you had no power,
but you had balls.

17:04.426 --> 17:07.061
- now look at you.
- yeah, now look at me.

17:07.130 --> 17:10.031
i have a dick
and balls, okay?

17:10.066 --> 17:11.867
can we not have this...

17:11.902 --> 17:14.770
no, please.
don't stop because of me.

17:14.805 --> 17:17.606
this is really interesting.

17:22.078 --> 17:23.813
hi, i don't think we've
had the chance to meet,

17:23.847 --> 17:25.414
but i'm thrilled
that you're here.

17:25.415 --> 17:28.250
- congrats on 20 years in d.c.
- madam vice president.

17:28.318 --> 17:31.120
the vice president
has decided to adopt
a rescue animal.

17:31.154 --> 17:34.423
- what kind of animal?
- um, it's a dog.

17:34.458 --> 17:36.926
a dog?
what, like your dog, mike?

17:36.960 --> 17:38.360
thank you very much.

17:38.395 --> 17:40.796
andrew miller, program
director at rainforest
conservancy.

17:40.831 --> 17:43.966
- plays the trumpet.
- what important work you do.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.768
and that's not
just the high notes.

17:45.769 --> 17:48.437
- i have a recital
coming up.
- okay.

17:48.438 --> 17:50.840
- you could have
said, "don't blow it."
- no, i'm not gonna say that.

17:50.874 --> 17:52.908
look at gary go.

17:52.943 --> 17:54.977
he's like a human
teleprompter for small talk.

17:55.011 --> 17:58.114
- he calls this gary-oke.
- it's so weird.

17:58.148 --> 18:00.182
it's like he's t horhe
whisperer or something.

18:00.217 --> 18:02.718
not that i think
your mother's a horse.

18:02.719 --> 18:05.721
jim wiseman,
united laminants
and guest.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.189
wife, not his daughter.
wife, not daughter.

18:07.224 --> 18:09.325
- <i>jim.</i>
- madam vice president.
good to see you.

18:09.359 --> 18:12.628
mom's smile
is starting to crack.

18:12.662 --> 18:14.897
it's like
her divorce face.

18:14.931 --> 18:17.900
oh, hey, i come from
a broken home, too.

18:17.934 --> 18:21.103
i found that the turmoil
made me more focused,

18:21.138 --> 18:23.706
more passionate,
more determined to get
the things i want.

18:23.740 --> 18:27.476
i'm jonah, by the way.
i work at the west wing
of the white house.

18:27.511 --> 18:30.079
as opposed to what,
the west wing of graceland?

18:30.080 --> 18:31.547
i can get you a tour
if you'd like.

18:31.581 --> 18:33.716
- yeah, i've seen it before.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.184
jonah, west wing.

18:35.218 --> 18:36.685
so how'd the dog
announcement go, buddy?

18:36.720 --> 18:38.554
uhke a bacon burka.

18:38.588 --> 18:40.523
what does that mean--
bacon burka?

18:40.557 --> 18:42.958
nothing. just if burkas
were made of bacon--

18:42.993 --> 18:46.562
see, it's kind of an open
secret in washington that
mike has an imaginary dog.

18:46.596 --> 18:48.898
- why?
- gets him out of staying
late for work.

18:48.932 --> 18:52.067
- we call it
his bullshit-tzu.
- that's kind of genius.

18:52.102 --> 18:54.937
- thanks, todd.
- problem? problem?

18:54.971 --> 18:57.239
hey!

18:57.274 --> 18:59.742
last two on the deck
of the titanic, huh?

18:59.776 --> 19:02.545
yeah, i think
i might jump.

19:02.579 --> 19:05.014
you know, i can see
right through your shirt.

19:05.048 --> 19:06.882
- is it designed that way?
- ma'am.

19:06.917 --> 19:08.350
- yes?
- we have an issue.

19:08.385 --> 19:10.920
the white house says
that they would like

19:10.954 --> 19:13.522
a, quote, "sidney purcell-
type figure"

19:13.557 --> 19:15.057
involved on clean jobs.

19:15.091 --> 19:18.260
- <i>the person.</i>
- oh, what a fistful of fucks.

19:18.295 --> 19:20.296
you put sidney purcell
on clean jobs, it's over.

19:20.363 --> 19:22.231
it's done.
no one's gonna
stomach that.

19:22.265 --> 19:25.301
- well, what do you got?
- i kind of want to call
them out on their bluff.

19:25.302 --> 19:27.203
- i got something.
- what--

19:27.237 --> 19:30.072
- mr. purcell. hi, dan egan,
vice president's office.
- hi, dan.

19:30.107 --> 19:33.175
the vice president
would love to have you on
the clean jobs task force,

19:33.210 --> 19:35.478
- but we both know that would
look fucking horrible.
- thank you.

19:35.545 --> 19:37.446
so what we're proposing
is this: chuck will stay on.

19:37.481 --> 19:39.381
oh, really?
okay, so you came over

19:39.416 --> 19:42.251
to tell me that
you're disappointing
the shit out of me.

19:42.285 --> 19:44.453
i didn't know that.
you should have led
with that, buddy.

19:44.488 --> 19:47.923
but... you will have
a private channel to theeep

19:47.958 --> 19:50.126
on all clean job-
related issues.

19:50.127 --> 19:53.095
you'll have more
influence over policy
than the fucking task force.

19:53.130 --> 19:54.697
i'm gonna go talk
to catherine.

19:54.731 --> 19:56.132
she just got
a new roommate.

19:56.166 --> 19:58.267
i don't need factoids
about my daughter, gary.

19:58.301 --> 20:01.303
hi, honey. look at you.
you're standing all
by yourself.

20:01.338 --> 20:03.672
i'm fine, mom.

20:03.707 --> 20:06.575
are you hungry, love?
do you want ?

20:06.643 --> 20:10.679
- uh, no. it's okay.
i already ate.
- okay.

20:10.714 --> 20:11.914
oh, look here.
they want to take a picture.

20:11.948 --> 20:13.082
- oh, god.
- let's do that.

20:13.116 --> 20:15.017
yeah, put your
drink down, babe.

20:15.051 --> 20:16.919
- mom, i really hate pictures.
- no, honey, you're pretty.

20:16.953 --> 20:18.420
just smile now.
smile.

20:18.455 --> 20:20.422
catherine,
m really serious.
smile, okay?

20:20.457 --> 20:22.324
- there you go.

20:22.359 --> 20:25.728
oh, that's gonna be good.
that's gonna be sweet.

20:31.501 --> 20:34.236
i heard you have
a new roommate.

20:34.237 --> 20:36.172
uh-huh. dilka.

20:36.206 --> 20:37.273
- dilk--
- what?

20:37.307 --> 20:39.475
- dilka.
- dilka?

20:39.509 --> 20:42.511
- i think her dad's iranian.
- iranian?

20:42.546 --> 20:44.447
ah, senator.
just wanted to
let you know

20:44.481 --> 20:46.649
that your noise
about chuck furnham
did the trick.

20:46.683 --> 20:48.784
- he's off.
- well, that is great.

20:48.819 --> 20:50.519
- yeah.
- how did that happen?

20:50.554 --> 20:52.054
oh, well,
oil was so pissed

20:52.088 --> 20:54.523
that we tried
to put lightweight chuck
onto the task force

20:54.558 --> 20:56.859
that they forced the president
to go with somebody else--

20:56.893 --> 21:00.362
- sidney purcell.
- sweet hairy fuck.

21:00.397 --> 21:03.566
i need to speak
to the vice president.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.935
that's great.
thank you so much.

21:05.969 --> 21:08.437
hurricane selina--
they say they can
change the name.

21:08.472 --> 21:09.638
oh, you're kidding me.

21:09.673 --> 21:12.508
- that is incredibly
great news.
- well done.

21:12.542 --> 21:14.110
you're changing the name
of a hurricane?

21:18.048 --> 21:20.649
yeah.
and that would have been
a disaster for us.,

21:20.684 --> 21:22.985
yeah, naturally.
it's amazing.

21:23.019 --> 21:24.587
you're trying
to control the weather.

21:24.588 --> 21:26.755
you are not
fucking thor, mom.

21:26.756 --> 21:28.657
i'm just gonna go
do my homework.

21:28.692 --> 21:30.326
no, catherine, listen.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.895
it a much more complicated
and nuanced situation.

21:32.929 --> 21:36.332
no, it's really not.
don't you yes-men ever
say no to her?

21:36.366 --> 21:39.235
- of course they do.
- yeah, we do. yeah.

21:39.269 --> 21:40.770
- exactly.
- all right, you know what?

21:40.804 --> 21:42.404
you're a little bit
out of control.

21:42.439 --> 21:43.939
- come with me. yes.
- out of control?

21:43.940 --> 21:46.075
- ow.
- no, don't say ow.
you know that didn't hurt.

21:46.109 --> 21:48.778
get into here.
i need to talk to you
for a second.

21:48.845 --> 21:51.781
not everything
is always about you.

21:51.848 --> 21:55.618
i know that everything
isn't always about me.
i know that.

21:55.652 --> 21:57.953
you're changing the name
of a hurricane, mom.

21:57.988 --> 21:59.755
this is how it works.

21:59.790 --> 22:02.391
this is real life.
this is complicated.

22:02.425 --> 22:04.293
- this is nuanced.
- <i>nuanced?</i>

22:04.361 --> 22:08.130
- you need experience.
- mom, stop talking to me
like a fucking politician.

22:08.165 --> 22:11.300
i've been trying, catherine.
i've been trying to talk
to you this whole day.

22:11.334 --> 22:13.436
- about what?
- about everything.

22:13.470 --> 22:16.105
i didn't even know
that you had a new roommate.

22:16.139 --> 22:18.107
what's-his-ass
had to tell me.

22:18.141 --> 22:19.642
<i>i know.</i>
<i>gary told you.</i>

22:19.676 --> 22:21.710
all you have to do,
mom, is ask.

22:21.745 --> 22:24.079
- seriously.

22:26.850 --> 22:29.452
okay.
how about this?

22:29.486 --> 22:33.255
um, listen.
we are not gonna change
the name of the hurricane.

22:33.290 --> 22:35.257
- sure.
- thank you, mom.

22:35.292 --> 22:36.959
i'm sorry i got
so upset before.

22:36.993 --> 22:38.994
- oh, look at her apologizing.
- not a problem.

22:38.995 --> 22:41.464
- isn't she good to apologize?
- madam vice president.

22:41.498 --> 22:44.266
- we need to talk.
- okay. what can i do for you?

22:44.301 --> 22:48.904
well, you need to put
chuck furnham back on
the task force.

22:48.939 --> 22:51.807
wait, i'm confused,
because now you're begging me

22:51.842 --> 22:54.143
to put back onto
the task force

22:54.177 --> 22:58.180
the same person you
were begging me to take
off of the task force.

22:58.215 --> 23:02.251
when you say it out loud,
you know, it does sound--

23:02.252 --> 23:03.552
kind of idiotic.

23:03.587 --> 23:05.488
well, but it's not
as idiotic

23:05.522 --> 23:07.556
as the current
filibuster system.

23:07.591 --> 23:11.026
i can find a way to get
chuck furnham on the task
force for you, no problem.

23:11.061 --> 23:12.361
- super.
- super.

23:12.362 --> 23:14.096
- thank you, ma'am.
- you betcha.

23:14.131 --> 23:16.665
how about that?

23:16.700 --> 23:18.000
way to go, dan.

23:18.034 --> 23:20.636
catch-44, he caught it.
pow! oh, i'm sorry.

23:20.670 --> 23:22.338
are you guys all good
on clean jobs?

23:22.372 --> 23:25.207
chuck ham
is on and what?

23:25.208 --> 23:27.309
and sidney purcell
will stay on as an advisor

23:27.344 --> 23:29.779
- in an unofficial capacity.
- hmm.

23:29.813 --> 23:32.548
- all right. tick it.
- we can pick up
the dog tomorrow.

23:32.616 --> 23:34.583
- oh, great.
- i'm sorry. what are
you guys talking about?

23:34.618 --> 23:36.619
we're getting a g.
it's no big deal.

23:36.653 --> 23:38.220
why wasn't i told
about this?

23:38.221 --> 23:40.256
why would you be
told about that?

23:40.290 --> 23:43.459
the thing is, ma'am,
flotus is currently procuring
a canine for herself.

23:43.493 --> 23:46.562
the first dog, or f-dotus,
has been planned for weeks.

23:46.630 --> 23:49.799
we simply can't allow
the possibility that your
dog will overshadow f-dotus.

23:49.833 --> 23:52.368
- stop saying f-dotus.
- ma'am, you need
to kill the dog.

23:52.402 --> 23:55.004
not literally, but--
i mean, yeah, if it comes
to it, then literally.

23:55.038 --> 23:57.873
- no! kill the dog?
our dog?
- no, honey.

23:57.908 --> 23:59.742
where is mike?
where is he?

23:59.743 --> 24:02.077
back to his tits and dip.

24:02.145 --> 24:04.046
you guys,
are we seriously
gonna let the guy

24:04.080 --> 24:06.882
with the police sketch
face of a rapist tell
us what to do?

24:06.917 --> 24:09.552
oh, this rapist face
gets eights.

24:09.586 --> 24:11.353
consensually,
i might throw in.

24:11.388 --> 24:13.189
why are we killing the dog?
i just announced it.

24:13.223 --> 24:16.425
because the first lady
is getting one, so now
i can't get one.

24:16.493 --> 24:18.928
- why don't i know this?
- because you're incompetent.

24:18.929 --> 24:21.197
oh, here's an idea.mike's alre.

24:21.231 --> 24:23.265
he's got the whole setup
for one-- the blankets,

24:23.266 --> 24:25.301
the crate, the balls,
all the little toys and stuff.r

24:25.335 --> 24:27.169
- why doesn't
he'  he take the pooch?p
for- that's a great idea.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.405
- mm-mmm, no, no.
- great solution.
great solution.

24:29.439 --> 24:31.207
simon is an alpha male.

24:31.241 --> 24:33.109
actually, i think
that is a good idea.

24:33.143 --> 24:35.144
- why are you guys laughing?
- stop, mom.

24:35.212 --> 24:37.713
seriously, mike has
a fake dog.

24:37.747 --> 24:40.182
you're like the only one here
who doesn't know that.

24:40.217 --> 24:42.284
what?

24:42.319 --> 24:44.553
yeah, he uses it
to get out of stuff
like if he's late.

24:44.588 --> 24:46.489
it's called
a shitbull terrier.

24:46.490 --> 24:48.390
- it's a bullshit-tzu.
- bullshit-tzu.

24:48.425 --> 24:50.793
is this true, mike?

24:50.794 --> 24:52.294
it got a little
out of hand.

24:52.295 --> 24:54.530
you carry a picture of it
in your wallet, mike.

24:54.564 --> 24:56.465
i just got it
from google images.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.200
i'm sorry, ma'am.
i thought you knew, ma'am.

24:58.235 --> 25:00.536
- otherwise i would not
have been laughing.
- gary knew?

25:00.570 --> 25:03.272
- even fucking gary knew?
- okay.

25:03.340 --> 25:04.840
you are getting the dog.

25:04.875 --> 25:08.210
you are getting
this little rat-faced,

25:08.245 --> 25:12.782
repulsive, yappy,
crepit-looking terrier.

25:12.816 --> 25:15.618
wow, i'm glad that
you were so honest

25:15.652 --> 25:17.486
about liking
the one that i chose.

25:17.521 --> 25:20.122
catherine, i didn't--
okay, now i've got to deal
with that situation.

25:20.157 --> 25:22.057
so thank you.
catherine.

25:22.058 --> 25:23.926
maybe i've got
a real excuse now.

25:25.228 --> 25:27.396
- sue's pretty wasted.
- yeah.

25:27.397 --> 25:30.432
and arguably a nine.

25:33.870 --> 25:35.471
