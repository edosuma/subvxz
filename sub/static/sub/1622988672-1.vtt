WEBVTT

01:12.656 --> 01:15.868
Push! Yes! There you go!

01:15.951 --> 01:18.328
Okay, give me one more good push!

01:18.412 --> 01:20.247
You can do it, Holly!

01:20.330 --> 01:21.874
Tell her she can do it, Ted.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.211
Okay, Ted says you can do it, Holly! Yes.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.617
I usually give it a kick.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.993
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.162
Right there.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.582
I mean, I could do it for you,
if you'd like.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.752
No, I've been doing all my own kicking
since third grade, so...

02:09.086 --> 02:12.799
What, so just one kick
and then apparently magic?

02:12.883 --> 02:13.800
Mm-hmm.

02:35.531 --> 02:37.115
Josh.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.868
This has been the best year of my life.

02:39.952 --> 02:43.121
I never thought I'd meet someone
I connect with on so many levels.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.709
You make me feel like I have
a champion and a confidant.

02:47.793 --> 02:52.130
I can tell you anything without judgment,
and you always have my back.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.592
I love you. So here's to us.

02:56.635 --> 02:57.761
I feel the same way.

02:59.137 --> 02:59.972
What?

03:00.556 --> 03:02.015
"I feel the same way"?

03:02.099 --> 03:04.643
Yeah. Yeah. Can we clink now?

03:04.726 --> 03:06.103
It's our one-year anniversary.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.481
I guess I was expecting something
a little more special.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.694
Sorry to interrupt.
Would you like to see the dessert tray?

03:14.653 --> 03:15.779
Sure, why not?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.035
Happy anniversary.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.020
No, it's mine.

03:57.154 --> 04:00.991
So, what is
the Sacred Heart Love Trail all about?

04:01.074 --> 04:04.328
Well, six years ago, Joanna and I

04:04.411 --> 04:06.955
took a look around
and we were super bummed.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.708
All these relationships falling apart.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.211
Heartbreak out there on the planet.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.463
So Marv and I created a way

04:14.546 --> 04:18.466
for couples to disconnect from the world
and reconnect with each other.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.513
Before you head out, there's
a couple of items that we've provided.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.722
In your love bags.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.433
The most important is a heart

04:26.517 --> 04:30.145
carved out of sacred Chippewa stone
with your name on it.

04:30.229 --> 04:33.106
We ask that you give this
to your partner every day

04:33.190 --> 04:35.609
and think about what that really means...

04:35.692 --> 04:37.945
-...to give your heart to someone.
-I love them.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.698
Feel free to explore,
but don't wander too far from the trail.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.034
There's no cell service here in the wild,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.537
and we don't want anyone dying out there.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.704
Right.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.708
Seriously, some people died last time.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.169
Most of all, remember to use this time

04:54.253 --> 04:56.213
as a way to grow your love for each other.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.090
And don't worry about the clouds.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.008
Weatherman says it'll clear soon

05:00.092 --> 05:02.386
and the rest of the week
is nothing but sunshine.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.556
-Mel!
-Leave me alone!

05:05.639 --> 05:07.683
All I said was we should bail on the hike.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.561
I didn't mean us in general.
I just meant the hike!

05:10.644 --> 05:13.146
I mean, come on,
we've been lost for hours,

05:13.230 --> 05:15.482
our phones don't work,
we're wet and miserable,

05:15.566 --> 05:17.693
you're pissed off at me for some reason.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.570
-"For some reason"?
-Okay.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.238
You lost my heart.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.198
I gave you my heart and you lost it.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.950
Mel, it was a rock.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.243
It was a metaphor.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.954
I imbued it with meaning
when I gave it to you.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.664
Are you sure I didn't give it back to you?

05:30.747 --> 05:32.833
Check your backpack,
'cause I'm telling you, I di--

05:32.916 --> 05:35.252
Then why do I have your heart?

05:36.545 --> 05:39.339
All right, so what--
Do you want me to go look for it?

05:39.423 --> 05:42.092
Okay, I'll do it.
I will search this whole forest

05:42.176 --> 05:45.470
for that one vaguely heart-shaped rock.
Is that what you want?

05:45.554 --> 05:46.722
Yeah.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.474
Babe, it's a rock.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.603
What is the point of doing this
if you're not gonna put in any effort?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.980
I don't know
what the point of this is at all.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.982
You don't wanna make
our relationship better?

05:57.065 --> 05:59.443
Our relationship is fine.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.321
It's... fine.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.156
Why does everything have to be perfect?

06:04.239 --> 06:05.824
Why can't it just be enough?

06:05.908 --> 06:08.118
Okay. Yeah.
Keep pretending nothing's wrong, right?

06:08.202 --> 06:09.828
'Cause it's easier that way.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.371
This is exhausting.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.250
Wait. What's that?

06:15.334 --> 06:17.294
-Church bells?
-You hear them too?

06:18.128 --> 06:20.756
You sometimes hear church bells
no one else does?

06:27.012 --> 06:29.473
There must be a town across that bridge.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.934
You see a bridge too?

06:32.601 --> 06:33.977
Oh, we're still doing that?

07:00.546 --> 07:01.797
That was weird.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.299
It stopped raining.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.718
"Schmigadoon"?

07:07.803 --> 07:10.347
As long as they have
a functioning toilet, I'm in.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.558
And what's with all the fake plants?

07:12.641 --> 07:14.601
Maybe they're conserving water?

07:20.566 --> 07:22.317
Okay...

07:22.401 --> 07:23.569
What is this?

07:26.572 --> 07:30.242
And why is music coming from everywhere?

07:30.325 --> 07:33.036
Welcome to our little town

07:33.120 --> 07:35.330
Where friends are all you'll meet

07:36.540 --> 07:38.792
And you will never see a frown

07:38.876 --> 07:40.210
Hey, everyone.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.296
Hey there, Pete.

07:42.379 --> 07:48.844
We bet you're prob'ly
Wonderin' what we call

07:48.927 --> 07:55.934
The most beautiful, wonderful
Magical place of all

07:57.686 --> 07:59.271
What is happening?

07:59.354 --> 08:02.816
It must be something they do for tourists.
Like Colonial Williamsburg.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.698
Schmigadoon

08:09.781 --> 08:12.993
Where the sun shines bright
From July to June

08:13.076 --> 08:16.413
And the air's as sweet as a macaroon

08:16.496 --> 08:20.083
Schmigadoon

08:21.001 --> 08:23.795
Okay, we did not buy tickets.
I repeat, we're not ticket holders.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.214
Stop it. Let them sing.

08:25.297 --> 08:28.717
Schmigadoon

08:28.800 --> 08:32.179
Where it's warm
And safe as a new cocoon

08:32.261 --> 08:35.390
And our hearts all glow
Like a harvest moon

08:35.474 --> 08:38.018
Schmigadoon

08:38.101 --> 08:39.102
Schmigadoon

08:39.186 --> 08:42.606
Where the men are men
And the cows are cows

08:42.688 --> 08:46.068
And the farmers smile
As they push their plows

08:46.151 --> 08:50.531
And the trees are tall
And we call it Schmigadoon

08:51.114 --> 08:52.741
Come on, it's charming.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.035
Charming? It's Wicker Man.

08:56.119 --> 09:00.165
Our schoolmarm is Emma Tate
She helps our kids to punctuate

09:00.249 --> 09:02.793
Still unmarried at 28

09:02.876 --> 09:04.336
In Schmigadoon

09:04.419 --> 09:08.674
Farmer McDonough craved a son
But he had daughters, every one

09:08.757 --> 09:10.926
Touch 'em and you'll answer to my gun

09:11.009 --> 09:12.719
In Schmigadoon

09:12.803 --> 09:14.680
-Ow!
-Sorry, Pete!

09:14.763 --> 09:16.974
Larry Bean puts out our fires

09:17.057 --> 09:19.017
Helen Pritt conducts the choirs

09:19.101 --> 09:21.144
Doc is here to cure what ails

09:21.228 --> 09:23.188
And I am here in case he fails

09:23.272 --> 09:25.357
He is here in case he fails

09:25.440 --> 09:27.568
Is Pete okay?

09:27.651 --> 09:29.361
Henry Brown brings our ice

09:29.444 --> 09:31.238
Madam Vina gives advice

09:31.321 --> 09:33.365
In that shack is Buford Riggs

09:33.448 --> 09:35.742
I do unspeakable things to pigs

09:35.826 --> 09:37.578
He does unspeakable things to pigs

09:38.620 --> 09:40.080
It's the mayor!

09:40.622 --> 09:41.957
This is never gonna end.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.084
It's the mayor.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.545
As mayor of Schmigadoon

09:47.546 --> 09:50.841
I feel that I must stress

09:50.924 --> 09:52.801
Our motto is

09:52.885 --> 09:56.972
"We always strive
For peace and happiness"

09:57.556 --> 09:59.558
Our motto is

09:59.641 --> 10:05.856
"We always strive
For peace and happiness"

10:05.939 --> 10:06.940
But...

10:07.024 --> 10:08.901
It's Mrs. Layton.

10:08.984 --> 10:12.696
If Schmigadoon is to endure

10:12.779 --> 10:16.158
It must be kept pristine and pure

10:16.241 --> 10:19.870
This land on which our fathers trod

10:19.953 --> 10:24.791
Must ever obey the laws of God

10:26.710 --> 10:27.836
Everybody!

10:30.464 --> 10:33.634
Schmigadoon!

10:33.717 --> 10:37.513
Where the church bells ring
Every day at noon

10:37.596 --> 10:40.474
And the Wells Fargo wagon
Brought my new harpoon

10:40.557 --> 10:42.392
Schmigadoon

10:42.476 --> 10:44.394
-Ow!
-Sorry, Pete.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.523
Where a man can dream
Dreams so big and wide

10:47.606 --> 10:51.068
And a gal can be there
Right by his side

10:51.151 --> 10:54.571
And there's hope for all
Whether great or small

10:54.655 --> 10:58.158
There's no folderol
Bring your parasol

10:58.242 --> 11:02.162
And we call it

11:02.246 --> 11:05.290
Schmiga

11:05.374 --> 11:08.919
Schmiga, Schmiga
Schmiga, Schmiga

11:09.002 --> 11:15.551
S-C-H-M-I-G-A-D-O-O-Ohhh!

11:16.301 --> 11:19.888
Schmigadoon!

11:22.975 --> 11:25.811
Yay! You guys did that!

11:25.894 --> 11:27.688
-Can we please go now?
-Already?

11:27.771 --> 11:29.523
You know how much I hate musicals.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.567
People don't just
burst into song in real life.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.820
You seem okay with magical hammers
that come back when you call them.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.196
That's totally different.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.032
Thor is the god of thunder, and of course
Mjollnir comes back when he calls.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.951
-Howdy, folks.
-Oh, no.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.786
Please do not make me
interact with the performers.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.874
You know how much I hate the--
Hey! Mr. Mayor.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.209
Welcome to Schmigadoon.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.962
Mayor Aloysius Menlove at your service.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.797
And this is my wife, Florence.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.299
Here, have a button.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.676
I'm running unopposed again.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.678
But who doesn't love buttons?

12:01.346 --> 12:03.849
-I'm Melissa. This is Josh.
-Pleased to meet you.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.018
You'll be staying
at the Schmigadoon Inn, of course.

12:06.101 --> 12:09.980
Oh, you'll love it. Aloysius and I
stayed there on our honeymoon.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.232
Although we didn't
get much sleep that night

12:12.316 --> 12:14.234
on account of all the roosters out back.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.362
-I see.
-Actually, we were just headed out, so--

12:17.446 --> 12:19.573
You know, we've been sleeping
on the ground for days,

12:19.656 --> 12:22.201
so why would we pass up an actual bed?

12:22.284 --> 12:23.660
That settles it then.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.788
Carson. Run down to the inn

12:26.872 --> 12:30.250
and tell Harvey we have
two very special guests checking in.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.877
Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor.

12:34.046 --> 12:38.425
Well, what an unusual
and exotic couple the two of you make.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.344
No wedding rings, I see.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.721
-Oh, no, we're not married.
-Definitely not.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.640
-Really?
-What?

12:44.723 --> 12:46.308
Anyhoo, I'm Mildred Layton,

12:46.391 --> 12:48.977
and this is my husband,
the Reverend Layton.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.230
Shoulders back, Howard,
like you have a purpose.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.106
I hope you folks can stay till Sunday.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.609
Would love to see you
in the congregation, it'd be real special.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.695
I can promise you
we'll be long gone before then.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.615
-So, where's this inn?
-Right this way.

13:03.158 --> 13:06.578
Hey. Be nice. They're trying.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.664
And it's kind of modern.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.207
I mean, you saw the ensemble.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.542
It's color-blind casting.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.043
Yeah, but I also get the feeling

13:13.126 --> 13:16.421
the preacher's wife doesn't like
our color-blind casting.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.965
What do you say, little lady?

13:18.048 --> 13:19.508
Want the thrill of a lifetime?

13:21.009 --> 13:22.177
First ride's on me.

13:23.095 --> 13:25.514
You just keep your distance, Danny Bailey.

13:25.597 --> 13:28.392
This town would be a far more
decent place without the likes of you.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.227
Now, Mrs. Layton, you don't mean that.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.478
Oh, yes, I do.

13:31.562 --> 13:34.022
You're nothing
but a scoundrel, a rapscallion,

13:34.106 --> 13:36.316
and, pardon my Jewish, a no-goodnik.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.026
Go ahead, the inn's right over there.

13:38.110 --> 13:41.029
Don't waste any more of your time
with this carnival trash.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.658
Yeah, looks like the town bad boy
has a thing for you.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.953
-Guess I'm gonna have to kick his ass.
-Oh, that I'd like to see.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.548
Sorry to keep you waiting.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.009
You must be the visitors
everyone's talking about.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.511
-Suppose you're looking for a room.
-Two rooms.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.347
They're not married, Harvey.

14:07.431 --> 14:10.851
And I'm sure you're well aware
of the town rules regarding such things.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.896
Yes. Yes, of course, Mrs. Layton.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.189
Two rooms.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.108
Okay, I get it.

14:18.192 --> 14:21.278
You're the preacher's wife,
and we're living in sin.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.197
It's like, "Oh, we're going to hell!"

14:24.364 --> 14:26.033
Just the one room, please.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.872
Sorry, sir. Town policy is town policy.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.000
Okay, listen, Harvey the Innkeeper.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.044
I'm tired and frankly
not up for playing along

14:37.127 --> 14:39.004
-with your little show--
-Josh, don't waste the energy.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.839
It's one night. We'll take the two rooms.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.133
Wonderful. That'll be a dollar.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.427
Fine. Yeah.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.388
Okay.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.809
Here's a dollar for two rooms.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.394
Thank you, kindly.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.188
This is ridiculous.

14:56.271 --> 15:00.150
Yeah, so to clarify, you're mad
because two rooms only cost a dollar?

15:00.234 --> 15:01.735
No, I'm just--

15:01.818 --> 15:05.822
I'm not interested in pretending
we're in the olden days right now.

15:05.906 --> 15:09.243
Okay, I don't wanna tell you
how to feel about this,

15:09.326 --> 15:10.994
but can you feel different?

15:11.620 --> 15:14.122
I just wanna get a freaking room
with my girlfriend

15:14.206 --> 15:17.084
where there's Wi-Fi and I can check
the score of the Yankees game

15:17.167 --> 15:18.168
and read my email.

15:18.252 --> 15:21.046
Sorry, sir. Mail wagon won't be here
until next week.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.756
-I hate you.
-Okay.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.970
You guys really are so great.

15:32.558 --> 15:36.228
Okay, granted,
this place is a little insane.

15:36.311 --> 15:40.190
Thank you. It is important to me
that we can hate things together.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.359
I know, sweetie. Me too.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.361
Look, I'm sorry
that I overreacted to all this.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.905
I just wish all these people would die.
Is that wrong?

15:46.989 --> 15:47.990
All right.

15:49.241 --> 15:51.785
Hey. You know what I wanna do?

15:51.869 --> 15:57.332
I'm gonna take a long, hot shower,
and then maybe go on the Tunnel of Love.

15:57.416 --> 15:59.835
-Really?
-I know, it's corny,

15:59.918 --> 16:01.795
but what else is there to do, right?

16:01.879 --> 16:03.380
It might be kind of romantic.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.092
You got it. I'll pick you up at 7:00.

16:07.176 --> 16:08.802
I'll be waiting.

16:08.886 --> 16:13.348
And hey, you know,
just 'cause we have two rooms

16:13.432 --> 16:15.851
doesn't mean we gotta use two rooms.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.271
-You know what I'm thinking?
-Mm-hmm.

16:28.197 --> 16:29.406
I hate this place.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.325
-I'll see you at 7:00.
-Can't wait.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.761
Josh?

16:52.930 --> 16:53.972
Josh.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.585
Evening, miss.

17:24.336 --> 17:27.005
Evening, mister.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.466
I don't believe
we were properly introduced.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.093
The name's Danny.

17:32.094 --> 17:35.264
-Danny Bailey.
-Yes, the rapscallion.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.765
I'm Melissa. Gimble.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.312
It's beautiful here at night.

17:42.396 --> 17:43.814
It's not alone.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.358
Offer's still open.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.902
First ride's on me. Second one too.

17:49.486 --> 17:52.447
Oh, no, I'm just here to look around.

17:52.531 --> 17:53.740
You're a funny kid.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.160
Wow, look at all the blossoms.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.871
Happens a lot this time of year.

17:59.663 --> 18:02.541
Whenever the wind blows.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.002
So. You have a feller?

18:05.085 --> 18:07.379
Yes, I have a feller.

18:07.462 --> 18:11.842
And he's okay with you walking on your own
at night, talking with strange men?

18:12.509 --> 18:14.219
Well-- He's...

18:15.554 --> 18:17.306
What's the question again?

18:17.389 --> 18:19.600
Wait a minute. What are you trying to do?

18:19.683 --> 18:21.226
Are you trying to get me to fall for you?

18:21.810 --> 18:23.103
What? No.

18:23.187 --> 18:26.023
Then why do those crazy kind
of thoughts keep running through my head?

18:26.815 --> 18:28.901
-I don't really--
-Well, you can forget it.

18:28.984 --> 18:32.571
Because no woman is gonna tie
Danny Bailey down, no how.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.655
Sure.

18:33.739 --> 18:40.162
When a squirrel wants another squirrel
He don't bother to get attached

18:40.245 --> 18:41.371
I get a private show.

18:42.998 --> 18:46.668
And a robin don't think
About the future

18:46.752 --> 18:50.672
When he's got an itch to be scratched

18:50.756 --> 18:52.257
You're very good.

18:52.341 --> 18:56.845
I'm like an animal in the wild

18:56.929 --> 19:02.100
So here's a truth to which
You must be reconciled

19:02.184 --> 19:03.852
Need a better agent.

19:07.481 --> 19:14.279
You can't tame me
This buck was meant to be free

19:14.363 --> 19:21.203
A cowgirl on the range in El Paso
Smiled at me and got out her lasso

19:21.286 --> 19:27.292
And that's when I put on the gas
Oh, you can't tame me

19:34.174 --> 19:40.848
You can't tame me
I'm like the wind on the sea

19:40.931 --> 19:44.518
A music teacher named Annabella

19:44.601 --> 19:47.980
Tried her best to make me her fella

19:48.063 --> 19:53.861
But I choose to live a cappella
You can't tame me

19:53.944 --> 19:56.822
It's true

19:58.073 --> 20:01.952
But if anyone could

20:02.035 --> 20:09.042
It'd be someone like you

20:20.053 --> 20:21.889
I don't dance. I took like a year of tap--

20:22.848 --> 20:24.808
Let's let our bodies do the talking.

20:24.892 --> 20:27.728
Okay, well our mouths
are technically part of our bodies, so...

20:44.286 --> 20:47.789
And somehow I can see

20:48.332 --> 20:55.088
Just exactly how it'd be

20:58.133 --> 21:01.470
In a cozy little cottage
With a white picket fence

21:01.553 --> 21:04.640
And a tractor that always needs fixin'

21:06.183 --> 21:09.436
And beamin' with pride
Is the prettiest bride

21:09.520 --> 21:12.856
This side of the Mason-Dixon

21:12.940 --> 21:16.902
We'd have a kid
Or two or three

21:16.985 --> 21:22.074
Two girls for you
And two boys for me

21:22.157 --> 21:24.284
Shouldn't all the kids be for both of us?

21:24.868 --> 21:28.705
And the two of us'd
Share one heart

21:28.789 --> 21:33.836
Till someday we'd die one day apart

21:35.379 --> 21:37.047
But that'll never be.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.342
'Cause you can't tame

21:40.425 --> 21:47.057
Me

21:48.809 --> 21:50.978
Great. Bravo.

21:51.061 --> 21:53.480
That was a very handsome song.

21:54.273 --> 21:55.274
What song?

21:55.941 --> 21:58.277
The one you were just singing to me.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.778
Singing?

21:59.862 --> 22:01.280
Okay.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.950
It's late. I'm tired.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.660
It's getting weird.

22:06.743 --> 22:10.372
So, thank you and good night.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.257
Sorry about last night.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.927
I seriously didn't mean to fall asleep.

22:25.179 --> 22:26.388
But to make it up to you,

22:26.471 --> 22:29.975
today we can do that Tunnel of Love ride
as many times as you want.

22:30.058 --> 22:32.561
Yeah, I'm good. I'm really hungry.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.062
Can we order? Waitress!

22:36.231 --> 22:37.941
Good morning. How we doing today?

22:38.025 --> 22:39.151
Sleep well last night?

22:39.234 --> 22:41.528
Yes, Betsy. Slept like a log.

22:44.114 --> 22:46.283
Oh, my gosh, "like a log"?

22:46.366 --> 22:49.077
That is hilarious,
'cause logs don't sleep.

22:49.161 --> 22:51.038
You're so funny!

22:51.121 --> 22:53.457
-I'm not that funny.
-He's really not.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.334
-Could we maybe order something?
-Sure.

22:55.417 --> 22:59.421
You are actually in luck, because today
we have our world-famous corn puddin'.

22:59.505 --> 23:01.673
Corn puddin'? What's that?

23:01.757 --> 23:02.966
What?

23:03.842 --> 23:07.054
Are you trying to tell me
that you've never heard of corn puddin'?

23:07.137 --> 23:09.139
She's never heard of corn puddin'!

23:09.806 --> 23:13.602
Oh, no. It's a song.
You just started another song.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.771
Corn puddin'
Corn puddin'

23:15.854 --> 23:18.357
Corn puddin', corn puddin'
Corn puddin', corn puddin'

23:20.526 --> 23:21.902
Can we opt out of this?

23:23.195 --> 23:25.322
My gal loves corn puddin'

23:25.405 --> 23:27.366
She eats it constantly

23:27.449 --> 23:29.576
Sometimes I get to wonderin'

23:29.660 --> 23:31.495
Does she love it more than me?

23:31.578 --> 23:34.540
Does she love it more than me?

23:35.791 --> 23:38.043
My guy loves corn puddin'

23:38.126 --> 23:40.087
I've got the recipe

23:40.170 --> 23:42.422
So if he wants my puddin'

23:42.506 --> 23:43.882
He'll have to marry me

23:43.966 --> 23:46.927
Oh, he'll have to marry me

23:50.222 --> 23:52.683
You put the corn in the puddin'
And the puddin' in the bowl

23:52.766 --> 23:55.102
You put the bowl in your belly
'Cause it's good for the soul

23:55.185 --> 23:57.646
You put the corn in the puddin'
And the puddin' in the bowl

23:57.729 --> 23:59.982
You put the bowl in your belly
'Cause it's good for the soul

24:00.065 --> 24:02.234
Who wants corn puddin'?

24:02.317 --> 24:04.695
We want corn puddin'

24:04.778 --> 24:07.030
Who wants corn puddin'?

24:07.114 --> 24:09.408
We want corn puddin'

24:12.911 --> 24:15.706
-What?
-I think they want us to take a verse.

24:15.789 --> 24:18.792
-I'm not singing, and you're not singing.
-Come on, could be fun.

24:18.876 --> 24:20.878
No. Do not.

24:20.961 --> 24:22.546
Never had corn puddin'

24:22.629 --> 24:23.630
Why?

24:24.214 --> 24:26.758
And it may be a waste

24:27.593 --> 24:29.636
But if you've got some extry

24:29.720 --> 24:30.637
"Extry"?

24:30.721 --> 24:32.723
I sure would like a taste

24:32.806 --> 24:35.225
Oh, she sure would like a taste

24:36.977 --> 24:41.523
Corn, corn, corn, corn, corn

24:41.607 --> 24:46.320
Puddin'!

24:48.614 --> 24:49.781
Yum!

24:49.865 --> 24:50.866
Yum!

24:51.825 --> 24:53.118
That was so weird.

24:53.202 --> 24:55.787
It was like as soon as I started singing,
I knew what to say.

24:55.871 --> 24:57.789
That's fantastic. Can we please go now?

24:57.873 --> 24:59.750
-What? Why?
-Are you serious?

24:59.833 --> 25:02.753
The entire town and you
just spent the last five minutes

25:02.836 --> 25:04.338
singing about corn pudding.

25:04.421 --> 25:06.465
Did somebody say, "corn puddin'"?

25:06.548 --> 25:08.008
That's it, we're leaving.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.761
-Okay, well that one's on you.
-Corn puddin', corn puddin'

25:12.137 --> 25:13.805
I just feel bad, you know?

25:13.889 --> 25:16.058
Everybody was so nice.
We didn't even say goodbye.

25:16.141 --> 25:17.559
And risk starting another song?

25:17.643 --> 25:18.852
They'll be fine.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.274
What?

25:27.110 --> 25:28.278
Wait a minute.

25:32.366 --> 25:33.867
What is going on?

25:33.951 --> 25:37.329
-It's like we can't leave.
-Well, of course we can leave.

25:40.457 --> 25:42.417
Okay, this is freaky.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.545
It's like it's magic or...

25:44.628 --> 25:46.380
-It's not magic.
-Then what is it?

25:46.463 --> 25:49.258
I don't know.
It's like a trick bridge or something.

25:49.341 --> 25:51.426
A trick bridge? What would that even be?

25:51.510 --> 25:53.136
It would be this, okay?

25:55.597 --> 25:56.849
I'm gonna try something.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.205
This cannot be happening.

26:22.666 --> 26:25.544
What's going on, Josh? What is this?

26:28.088 --> 26:32.718
Once ye have entered Schmigadoon

26:32.801 --> 26:37.556
'Tis true ye won't be leaving soon

26:37.639 --> 26:43.437
Within its borders ye are bound

26:43.520 --> 26:48.609
Until at last true love ye've found

26:49.401 --> 26:54.823
But till ye find it, ye must stay

26:55.532 --> 27:01.663
Where life's a musical every day

27:10.005 --> 27:11.298
Was that a leprechaun?

27:13.091 --> 27:14.301
Yes.

27:14.384 --> 27:15.719
Yeah. Uh-huh.

27:16.428 --> 27:18.180
He said something. What did he say?

27:18.889 --> 27:19.973
I don't know.

27:20.057 --> 27:24.770
I was more focused on how he was
shattering my whole construct

27:24.853 --> 27:27.356
of what's real and not real in the world,

27:27.439 --> 27:29.399
because he was a freaking leprechaun.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.319
"Life's a musical every day."

27:36.949 --> 27:40.077
This isn't some tourist attraction.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.620
This is a musical.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.997
We're in an actual musical.

27:44.081 --> 27:45.707
Oh, please, God, no.

27:45.791 --> 27:48.752
But he said we're only here
till we've found true love, which--

27:48.836 --> 27:50.379
I love you. Do you love me?

27:50.462 --> 27:51.797
What? Yes, of course.

27:52.548 --> 27:54.842
So let's try the bridge again,
now that we know the rules.

27:54.925 --> 27:56.218
Yes. Now we know.

27:57.469 --> 27:58.637
I love you.

27:59.638 --> 28:01.098
I love you too.

28:01.181 --> 28:03.267
You hear that, Mr. Leprechaun?

28:03.350 --> 28:04.685
We're in love.

28:20.284 --> 28:22.995
Welcome to our little town

28:23.078 --> 28:25.289
Where friends are all you'll meet

28:26.498 --> 28:29.209
And you will never see a frown

28:29.293 --> 28:32.254
-Hey, everyone.
-Hey there, Pete.

28:32.337 --> 28:38.802
We bet you're prob'ly
Wonderin' what we call

28:38.886 --> 28:45.893
The most beautiful, wonderful
Magical place of all

28:52.983 --> 28:55.986
Schmigadoon

28:56.069 --> 28:59.531
Where the sun shines bright
From July to June

28:59.615 --> 29:02.951
And the air's as sweet as a macaroon

29:03.035 --> 29:05.579
Schmigadoon

29:05.662 --> 29:06.663
Schmigadoon

29:06.747 --> 29:09.791
Where a man can dream
Dreams so big and wide

29:09.875 --> 29:13.337
And a gal can be there
Right by his side

29:13.420 --> 29:16.840
And there's hope for all
Whether great or small

29:16.924 --> 29:20.427
There's no folderol
Bring your parasol

29:20.511 --> 29:24.181
And we call it

29:24.264 --> 29:27.559
Schmiga

29:27.643 --> 29:31.188
Schmiga, Schmiga
Schmiga, Schmiga

29:31.271 --> 29:37.819
S-C-H-M-I-G-A-D-O-O-Ohhh!

29:38.570 --> 29:42.157
Schmigadoon!
