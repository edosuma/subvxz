Yeah,me And Janet. Cool.

00:07.410 --> 00:09.380
You Gotta Love Unbelievably Exciting,right?

00:09.540 --> 00:11.600
So Says The Girl Who Kissed Eddie Latekka.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.930
This Idea That Eddie And I Had Since We Were Kids,right-

00:14.080 --> 00:16.830
Open A Store That Sold And Installed Windows.

00:16.990 --> 00:18.270
Telling Owen About Me And His Wife-

00:18.420 --> 00:21.120
You Didn'T Just Blow Things Up. You Scorched The Earth.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.460
I Don'T Got No Friends And No Job. The Job I Can Help You With.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.680
You'Re Ruining My Business. I Have No Idea Why.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.110

Y- Yes, I'M Sure,mrs. Sokolow.

01:08.150 --> 01:09.550
Well,you Keep Us In Mind If The Windows

01:09.710 --> 01:12.260

01:12.430 --> 01:16.850
Yeah,sure, I Can Place The Order.

Well, You Seem To Be On A Roll.

01:32.090 --> 01:35.810
Well,there'S Definitely Some Unexpected Momentum.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.500
I Never Planned On "Us" Happening,

01:37.650 --> 01:39.260
But I Don'T Know. I Think Aubrey'S Great,and-

01:39.410 --> 01:41.790
I'M Not Talking About Your Love Life.

01:41.940 --> 01:42.910
Oh.

01:43.530 --> 01:45.970
Looks Like You Flew Through Your Half Of The Phone List.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.190
There'S Got To Be A Better Way

01:47.350 --> 01:49.620

In My Bathtub When I Get Home,

02:50.000 --> 02:53.270
But Sometimes We Don'T Get What We Want.

02:53.430 --> 02:53.880
Beer?

02:54.030 --> 02:56.340
Nah. Really,sully, I Need A Job.

02:56.490 --> 02:59.370
I'Ve Hit Up Everyone I Know. I'Ve Been Everywhere.

03:00.710 --> 03:03.590
Truth Is, I'D Hire You In A Second.

03:04.260 --> 03:06.060
But What You Did To Owen-

03:06.220 --> 03:08.360
Tearing Apart His Family Like That,

03:08.510 --> 03:09.810
There Isn'T A Soul From Here To Hyannis

03:09.960 --> 03:15.510
That'Ll Take You On, Including Me. I'M Sorry.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.350
Want That Beer Now?

03:20.510 --> 03:21.640
Sure.

03:21.830 --> 03:23.750
Put It On My Tab.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.090
I Gotta Respectfully Disagree With Sully,

03:28.270 --> 03:29.280
'Cause You And I Both Know

03:29.440 --> 03:32.630
There'S At Least One Soul Willing To Hire You.

03:34.890 --> 03:36.410
Come On.

03:36.910 --> 03:37.590
How Long Are You Gonna Let Them Play

03:37.750 --> 03:39.320
This Home Wrecking Card, Hmm?

03:39.490 --> 03:41.410
If It Wasn'T You,alison Probably Would Have Found

03:41.560 --> 03:45.330
Someone Else Somewhere Down The Line. Leave Alison Out Of It.

03:45.490 --> 03:47.420
Always The Gentleman.

03:47.580 --> 03:50.510
All I'M Saying Is I'M Here To Help.

03:50.650 --> 03:53.870
My Offer To Work At Cataldo Builders Still Stands.

03:54.530 --> 03:56.990
Uh,big Cat'S Buyin'.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.940
Thanks,sully,but No,thanks.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.910
* Till You Start To Treat Me Right *

04:05.240 --> 04:07.770
<i>* Mm,mm,i Love 'Em So</i>

04:08.200 --> 04:09.950
Not Bad.

04:10.230 --> 04:12.340
But This Time, Can You Lose The Vocals?

04:12.490 --> 04:13.630
What Vocals?

04:13.780 --> 04:16.430
The Bop,bop...

04:16.579 --> 04:19.029
Oh,yeah. That Stuff?

<i>* You'Re Hungry,too, I Can See *</i>

<i>* And It'S A Hot Dog, Hot Dog *</i>

04:30.500 --> 04:32.630
Sam,you Want An Apple Or String Cheese?

04:32.790 --> 04:36.790
The Dining Options Around Here Are Getting A Little Boring.

04:36.950 --> 04:39.200
I Was Just Telling Eddie The Same Thing.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.790
This New French Restaurant Just Opened Up In Bishop Flats.

04:41.950 --> 04:43.330
I'Ve Been Dropping Not-So-Subtle Hints

04:43.490 --> 04:45.970
That It'D Be Nice To Change Things Up. French,huh?

04:46.130 --> 04:47.930
Mm-Hmm. That'S Fancy.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.090
I Know. The Restaurant Has An Outdoor Patio.

04:51.230 --> 04:52.530
Romantic,right?

04:52.690 --> 04:55.900
Like A Sidewalk Caf閨On The Champs-

04:56.060 --> 04:58.030
That Sounds Amazing.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.600
Maybe I Should Drop Some Hints For Ray.

05:02.270 --> 05:03.420
What?

05:03.580 --> 05:06.490
<i>I Just Think It'S Funny How You Guys Are Such Good Friends,</i>

05:06.640 --> 05:08.890
And Eddie And Ray Are, Well,mortal Enemies.

05:09.090 --> 05:11.320
Well,that'S A Little Dramatic, Don'T You Think?

05:11.490 --> 05:12.250
All I'M Saying-

05:12.410 --> 05:14.990
It'S Like You'Re Dating Batman And You'Re Dating The Joker.

05:15.150 --> 05:16.980
Could Lead To Trouble. He'S Right.

05:17.140 --> 05:18.930
I Mean,clearly We Should Just End Our Friendship Now.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.710
Clearly.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.190
<i>Uh,and Eddie Is Way More Batman Than Ray.</i>

05:25.340 --> 05:27.850
<i>That Is So Not True.</i>

05:28.000 --> 05:30.230
Eddie Couldn'T Pull Off The Cape.

05:30.510 --> 05:33.200
We Should All Go Out On A Double Date.

05:33.370 --> 05:34.370
You Think?

05:34.520 --> 05:36.090
Why Should We Separately Enjoy French Cuisine

05:36.240 --> 05:38.850
When We'D Enjoy It So Much More If We Were Together?

05:39.010 --> 05:41.450
The Boys Need To Get Over Their Kindergarten Rivalry,

05:41.600 --> 05:45.520
And We Are Just The Girls To Show Them How. We Most Certainly Are.

05:45.660 --> 05:46.390
It'S A Date.

05:46.550 --> 05:48.940
Wow. Eddie And Big Cat On A Double Date.

05:49.090 --> 05:51.470
This Is Gonna Be The Talk Of Gotham City.

05:51.620 --> 05:53.000
Eat Your String Cheese.

05:53.140 --> 05:55.950
<i>* Hot Dog,hot Dog</i>

05:56.110 --> 05:58.860
<i>* Come On, Let'S Do The H Dog *</i>

05:59.010 --> 06:00.650
I- I Still Think We Should Lead With The Price List.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.080
Nobody Can Touch Us On These Numbers.

06:02.230 --> 06:04.810
We'Re Good. I Got It...

06:05.620 --> 06:07.460
Hello,gentlemen.

06:07.610 --> 06:09.130
I Am Carter Bump.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.470

06:11.460 --> 06:15.410
Uh... Eddie Latekka. Thanks For Seeing Us.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.590
You Look Awfully Familiar.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.670
Well,i Wrote This Book, "Turtle On A Snare Drum."

06:27.840 --> 06:30.010
Maybe You Read It.

06:31.610 --> 06:34.290
Remember Me From The Dust... Jacket?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.530
I Don'T Think So.

06:36.980 --> 06:37.840
I Really Think You'Re Gonna Like

06:38.000 --> 06:38.740
What We Have To Say About

06:38.880 --> 06:41.190
The Elementary School Renovaons.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.080
You Don'T Remember Me, Do You?

06:46.140 --> 06:47.610
I'M Sorry. Should I?

06:47.760 --> 06:49.410
Imagine Me Ten Years Younger,

06:49.560 --> 06:50.830
With More Hair,

06:50.980 --> 06:51.950
Sobbing In The Wake

06:52.110 --> 06:56.260
Of An Unending Stream Of Teenaged Mockery.

06:56.740 --> 06:57.810
Uh...

06:57.980 --> 06:59.330
I...

06:59.600 --> 07:01.590
Maybe This Will Help.

07:04.650 --> 07:06.490
I Stop By Holly'S Every Morning.

07:06.620 --> 07:09.700
Their Baked Goods Are The Best, But These...

07:09.910 --> 07:13.330
These Are My Favorite.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.320
Oh,hey.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.070
Anything?

07:20.230 --> 07:22.940
No,but Thank You For This Cupcake.

07:23.090 --> 07:24.990
It Looks,uh,delicious.

07:25.190 --> 07:28.870
Well,how About Now?

07:37.030 --> 07:38.430
Now...

07:38.580 --> 07:40.730
Kindly Remove Yourself From My Office

07:40.900 --> 07:43.500
And Never Come Back.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.760
Okay, What Just Happened?

07:48.920 --> 07:51.200
Who Is That Guy?

07:51.350 --> 07:53.780
That Was Carter Bump.

07:53.930 --> 07:56.100
I Know That. So?

07:56.250 --> 07:57.890
Carter Bump.

07:58.030 --> 07:59.170
The Name Isn'T Familiar?

07:59.330 --> 08:00.990
Yeah,it'S Familiar. Carter Bump-

08:01.150 --> 08:02.960
The Head Of Public Works, The Guy Who Awards Things

08:03.120 --> 08:05.070
Like The Elementary School Window Project.

08:05.230 --> 08:08.080
Carter Bump Is Also "The Cupcake Kid."

08:08.250 --> 08:09.740
What? The Cupcake Kid?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.960
You Remember The Cupcake Kid.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.650
No Way.

08:17.390 --> 08:18.920
That Was The Cupcake Kid?

08:19.070 --> 08:21.130
That Was The Cupcake Kid.

08:22.690 --> 08:24.980
Perfect.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.180
Oh,carter Bump, A.K.A. "The Cupcake Kid,"

08:55.330 --> 08:56.910
Was A High School Classmate Of Ours

08:57.060 --> 09:00.260
<i>Who Nick Wrote A Series Of Comic Books About.</i>

09:00.420 --> 09:01.870
Oh... Yeah.

09:02.020 --> 09:04.550
I Remember The Cupcake Kid Comics.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.820
My Favorite Was "The Cupcake Kid Meets Burger Boy."

09:07.970 --> 09:09.350
That Was A Classic!

09:09.500 --> 09:11.400
Yeah,why The Cupcake Kid?

09:11.560 --> 09:13.260
Oh,well,in The Comics,

09:13.420 --> 09:16.180
The Cupcake Kid Was A Mild-Mannered,fat Geek

09:16.340 --> 09:18.270
Who,after Downing A Plate Of Cupcakes,

09:18.410 --> 09:20.040
Would Possess Superhuman Powers

09:20.200 --> 09:21.800
Which He Would Then Use To Fight...

09:21.950 --> 09:24.050
Injustice! Injustice.

09:24.870 --> 09:26.680
Hence,the Cupcake Kid.

09:26.850 --> 09:28.110
Clever.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.570
You Remember The Motto?

09:29.740 --> 09:31.870
Ronnie... What Was It Again?

09:32.010 --> 09:34.550
<i>Butter,sugar, Eggs And Flour,</i>

09:34.720 --> 09:37.530
Frosting,sprinkles,superpower! Frosting,sprinkles,superpower!

09:40.700 --> 09:42.380
It'S Not My Proudest Moment.

09:42.530 --> 09:44.760
Found It! Issue Number Seven.

09:44.940 --> 09:46.320
"The Cupcake Kid Meets Double-Decker,"

09:46.480 --> 09:48.180
And It'S Signed.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.420
Burger Boy,double-Decker? Oh,yeah,

09:50.580 --> 09:53.550
And There Was "The Cupcake Kid Meets Sloppy Joe,"

09:53.710 --> 09:55.760
"Cupcake Kid Meets Jumbo Dog,"

09:55.920 --> 09:58.530
"Cupcake Kid Meets... Salami Sam."

09:58.680 --> 09:59.730
That Was Kind Of A Weird One.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.150
Enough Already. I Feel Terrible.

10:03.310 --> 10:04.580
You Should.

10:04.710 --> 10:07.290
That 2-Cent Comic'S Gonna Cost Us A 5-Figure Job.

10:07.460 --> 10:10.010
I Can'T Believe Carter Bump Still Holds A Grudge.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.970
Well,some Wrongs You Just Don'T Get Past.

10:13.130 --> 10:15.340
Do You Guys Remember The Cupcake Kid'S Motto?

10:15.500 --> 10:17.020
Butter,sugar,eggs...

10:17.170 --> 10:18.130
And Flour!

10:18.280 --> 10:21.890
Phil,phil,phil! We All Remember The Motto. It'S Fine.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.700
I Didn'T Even Get A Chance To Apologize.

10:23.850 --> 10:27.890
Carter Just Yelled At Me And Kicked Us Out. Well,i Could Put In A Call If You Want.

10:28.070 --> 10:29.660
I Know Carter From Planninmeetings

10:29.810 --> 10:32.290
And Because Of The Kids. Why Because Of The Kids?

10:32.450 --> 10:34.730
Well,when He'S Not Working For Public Works,

10:34.880 --> 10:37.280
He Happens To Be "Plumpy The Clown."

10:37.440 --> 10:39.470
Oh,you Gotta Be Kidng Me. What?

10:39.610 --> 10:41.150
What'S Plumpy The Clown?

10:41.320 --> 10:43.490
A Clown... For Kids.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.910
Okay,wait A Minute.

10:45.070 --> 10:46.730
He Didn'T Like Being Called, "The Cupcake Kid,"

10:46.890 --> 10:48.660
But He'S Fine With "Plumpy The Clown"?

10:48.810 --> 10:52.400
Oh,he'S Excellent. He Did Connor'S 6th Birthday.

10:52.490 --> 10:54.720
He Takes The Kids On A Magic Carpet Ride

10:54.890 --> 10:57.790
And Gives Them Imaginary Parachutes And Wacky Hats.

10:57.940 --> 10:59.380
Whoa,whoa,whoa, Wacky Hats?

10:59.540 --> 11:03.730
Yeah,mine Was A,uh,um, Octopus Made Of Balloons.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.180
Man,i Love That Thing. If You Really Can Get Us Back In Front Of Carter,owen,

11:07.330 --> 11:10.050
That-That'D Be Great. Oh,yeah.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.410
I'Ll Make The Call.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.380
Well,now That The Cupcake Kid'S Secret Identity

11:13.540 --> 11:16.460
Has Been Revealed... Who Is That?

11:16.610 --> 11:21.970
Oh,that'S Granger,the Band'S New Drummer. You Guys Have A Band?

11:22.600 --> 11:25.970
Yeah, It'S Better You Don'T Ask.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.390
Mmm.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.080
<i>What Was That For?</i>

11:38.240 --> 11:40.410
Consider It A Down Payment.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.690
On What?

11:42.920 --> 11:44.430
Well, Janet Was Telling Me

11:44.590 --> 11:47.910
About This New French Restaurant That Opened In Bishop Flats,

11:48.070 --> 11:49.380
And We Thought It Would Be A Great Place

11:49.540 --> 11:51.640
To Have Our First Double Date.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.030
????

11:55.180 --> 11:55.910
Eddie.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.240
Hence The Down Payment.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.110
Janet And I Are Best Friends.

12:00.270 --> 12:02.430
At Some Point, You'Re Gonna Need To-

12:04.510 --> 12:05.650
Mwah.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.710
What Was That For?

12:07.860 --> 12:10.180
Just Thought I'D Take A Bigger Down Payment.

12:11.750 --> 12:12.640
Let'S Do It.

12:12.790 --> 12:13.550
Really?

12:13.720 --> 12:15.100
I Thought You Were Gonna Puup More Of A Fight.

12:15.260 --> 12:16.660
What For?

12:17.260 --> 12:21.140
One Dinner With Eddie Latekka Is Worth A Lifetime With You.

12:24.430 --> 12:26.520
Thanks,batman.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.130
You Are Still Friends With Nick Garrett?

12:32.290 --> 12:33.980
Didn'T He Write Some Not-Too-Flattering Things

12:34.140 --> 12:36.730
About You In His Book? They Were Just Words.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.970
Words Have Power, Owen Rowan.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.460
Watch Out!

12:40.610 --> 12:43.390
See? Words Incite Action,

12:43.540 --> 12:44.870
Ruin Lives...

12:45.030 --> 12:46.990
Like "The Cupcake Kid" Comics Ruined Mine.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.380
I Don'T Have A Wife... No Kids.

12:49.550 --> 12:53.080
I Am Completely Unloved. No Love...

12:53.240 --> 12:55.270
All Because Of That Contemptible Comic.

12:55.430 --> 12:57.250
Oh,come On,carter.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.810
Those Comics Were Ten Years Ago.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.210
Do You Know Why I'M A Clown,owen?

13:02.450 --> 13:05.930
Because I Never Smile.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.460
Ask Anyoof In.E Fice

13:09.620 --> 13:11.400
The Only Time People See Me Smile

13:11.540 --> 13:13.980
Is When I Have One Painted On.

13:14.130 --> 13:15.740
Truth Is, I Haven'T Smiled Since

13:15.890 --> 13:18.210
The Senior Year Talent Show In High School.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.540
Why?

13:20.120 --> 13:22.900
I Was Supposed To Sing With Nicole Van Dusen,

13:23.060 --> 13:25.130
The Belle Of The Theater Department.

13:25.290 --> 13:29.540
Oh,i Remember Her. She Was Pretty. With The Voice Of An Angel.

13:29.700 --> 13:30.830
So For The Senior Year Talent Show,

13:30.990 --> 13:32.280
Nicole And I Were Going To Duet

13:32.440 --> 13:36.110
On Meatloaf'S "Paradise By The Dashboard Light." Love That Song.

13:36.260 --> 13:36.970
Who Doesn'T?

13:37.120 --> 13:39.410
And Nicole And I Had A Very Avant-Garde Impersonation

13:39.580 --> 13:42.240
Of The Piece- Groundbreaking.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.340
But When The First Cupcake Kid Comic Came Out,

13:46.500 --> 13:48.280
And I Became A Laughingstock,

13:48.430 --> 13:50.490
She Feigned Food Poisoning.

13:50.650 --> 13:52.920
Instead,i Had To Perform With Mr. Albano,

13:53.080 --> 13:55.350
The Sweaty Sock Of A Drama Teacher.

13:55.510 --> 13:57.230
I Was Humiliated

13:57.370 --> 14:00.390
And Never Smiledgain.

14:00.690 --> 14:04.650
<i>Nick Is Really Sorry About The Whole Cupcake Kid Thing.</i>

14:04.800 --> 14:06.730
We All Are,carter.

14:11.290 --> 14:13.350
You'Re A Good Man, Owen Rowan.

14:13.510 --> 14:14.690
In Recognition Of This

14:14.840 --> 14:18.560
And Your Continued Patronage Of My Clown Services,

14:18.730 --> 14:20.390
I Will Allow Best Friend Windows

14:20.530 --> 14:23.340
To Submit A Bid On The Elementary School Project.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.280
Tell Them To Have Their Proposal

14:24.430 --> 14:27.420
On My Desk By 5:00 Tomorrow.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.330
Thank You,carter.

14:30.490 --> 14:33.040
You'Re Welcome,owen.

14:37.730 --> 14:41.240
Is There,um,anything Else I Can Do For You?

14:41.390 --> 14:43.660
Well... Yes?

14:43.820 --> 14:47.440
Can You Make Me Another One Of Those Octopus Hats?

14:55.120 --> 14:57.400
<i>* And We Got The Beat</i>

14:57.550 --> 15:00.340
<i>* We Got The Beat That Kills</i>

15:00.490 --> 15:01.500
<i>* Yes,i Do</i>

15:01.660 --> 15:03.350
<i>* I Said,we Got The Beat</i>

15:03.490 --> 15:07.170
<i>* Yeah,we Got The Beat That Kills *</i>

15:08.610 --> 15:10.090
<i>* We Start Rocking</i>

15:10.240 --> 15:13.230
<i>* Every Time We Get Started... *</i>

15:13.390 --> 15:14.710
You All Right,son?

15:14.870 --> 15:16.500
Been Better.

15:17.270 --> 15:19.190
Um... They'Ll Come Around.

15:19.380 --> 15:21.470
These Things Just Take Time.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.330
Time'S All I Got Now.

15:23.470 --> 15:25.410
Got No Friends,no Job...

15:25.580 --> 15:26.810
I Got Nothin' Except For That Buckethead

15:26.970 --> 15:29.120
Sittin' In My Chair.

15:29.290 --> 15:30.960
<i>What Is He Doing,exactly?</i>

15:31.110 --> 15:33.970
I Know,right? He Looksidiculous.

15:34.940 --> 15:37.050
Well,take It Easy,ikey.

15:37.220 --> 15:38.360
Yeah.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.630
<i>* We Got The Rhythm Track</i>

15:41.800 --> 15:44.840
<i>* That'S Gonna Hit 'Em Where It Hurts *</i>

15:46.570 --> 15:49.530
Did I Ever Tell You How "Sneaky Pete" Got His Name?

15:50.480 --> 15:51.100
No.

15:51.270 --> 15:55.170
"Sneaky Pete" Used To Be Known Simply As "Pete,"

15:55.320 --> 15:57.480
But He Got Caught Stealing The Football Pool Money

15:57.640 --> 15:58.990
????

15:59.140 --> 16:02.310
Pete Was Afforded Outcast Status Tout Suite.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.590
But After A Certain Amount Of Time,it Passed.

16:04.740 --> 16:06.810
He Called For A Tribunal.

16:06.970 --> 16:08.060
A What?

16:08.220 --> 16:10.290
A Tribunal...

16:10.640 --> 16:13.270
To Plead His Case Before Those He Had Wronged.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.550
He Talked About What He Regretted

16:15.710 --> 16:18.340
And Why He Should Be Allowed Back Into The Fold,

16:18.710 --> 16:20.770
And Damned If It Didn'T Work.

16:20.930 --> 16:23.210
You And Your Friends Forgave Him?

16:23.360 --> 16:24.940
We Did.

16:25.080 --> 16:28.640
Of Course,um, He Had To Be Known As

16:28.800 --> 16:31.050
"Sneaky Pete" For The Rest Of His Days,

16:31.190 --> 16:33.140
But Still...

16:33.720 --> 16:36.610
At Least Those Days Aren'T Lonely.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.470
A Tribunal,huh?

16:39.110 --> 16:41.310
A Tribunal.

16:49.630 --> 16:51.210
I Can'T Believe Nick'S High School Scribblings

16:51.370 --> 16:52.490
Is Gonna Cost Best Friend Windows

16:52.650 --> 16:53.860
Its First Job.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.660
Does Everything That Guy Writes Have To Cause So Much Misery?

16:57.820 --> 16:59.700
Cut Him Some Slack. He Was A Kid.

16:59.850 --> 17:02.820
Can You Honestly Say You Didn'T Pick On Anyone In Those Days?

17:02.970 --> 17:04.200
No,not That I Can Remember.

17:04.359 --> 17:07.710
Oh,bullies Never Remember, But The Bullied Never Forget.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.450
Trust Me. I Know Of What I Speak. Hey,janet.

17:10.609 --> 17:13.780
You Know That French Restaurant You'Ve Been Raving About? Yeah.

17:13.930 --> 17:15.680
Went There On A Blind Date Last Night.

17:15.819 --> 17:18.990
How Was It? The Blind Date I Shall Not Revisit.

17:19.150 --> 17:21.760
The Restaurant I Hope To Often.

17:22.010 --> 17:22.890
I Wouldn'T Know.

17:23.050 --> 17:24.460
I'Ve Been Subliminally Trying To Get This One

17:24.619 --> 17:26.630
To Take Me There, But With Little Success.

17:26.790 --> 17:28.500
Well,i Wouldn'T Exactly Call It Subliminal.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.190
I Mean, You'Ve Done Everything

17:29.340 --> 17:31.940
Except Tape The Restaurant Review To My Forehead.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.750
I Made Reservations... For Four.

17:36.460 --> 17:40.150
Math'S Not My Strong Suit, But,uh,i Only Count Two.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.290
It'S A Double Date With Hannah And Ray.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.340
You'Re Serious?

17:46.490 --> 17:49.320
We'Re A Couple Now. We Should Docouple-Ythings,

17:49.450 --> 17:51.790
Like Go Out With My Best Friend And Her Fianc?

17:52.120 --> 17:54.780
There'S Couple-Y, And Then There'S...

17:54.920 --> 17:56.800
????

17:56.940 --> 17:59.130
Hannah'S Important To Me, Eddie.

17:59.280 --> 18:03.040
Yeah,i Get It,but Still, It'S Big Cat Cataldo.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.270
It'S One Meal.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.830
Please,eddie?

18:11.620 --> 18:13.100
Fine.

18:13.250 --> 18:16.260
Mm,thanks,batman.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.390
<i>I Was Looking For Mr. De Winter...</i>

18:20.380 --> 18:21.840
Ick) Do You Want Crackers?

18:22.010 --> 18:23.080
No,thanks.

18:23.230 --> 18:26.130
I Dip My Grilled Cheese Straight Into The Tomato Soup.

18:26.270 --> 18:27.880
I'M A Radical.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.660
You Aren'T Still Looking At Those Comics?

18:30.820 --> 18:32.740
Well,they'Re No "Turtle On A Snare Drum,"

18:32.900 --> 18:36.340
But Each Frame Is A Window Into Nick Garrett.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.690
You Mean,taking Advantage Of Other People'S Flaws

18:38.850 --> 18:40.050
To Tell A Story?

18:40.200 --> 18:43.570
<i>That'S Not What I Meant, But Yeah.</i>

18:44.420 --> 18:47.330
I Never Intended For It To Be A Big Deal.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.910
I Was Bored In Study Hall...

18:50.060 --> 18:51.970
Just Doodling...

18:52.130 --> 18:55.010
When I Noticed Carter Bump In The Back Row

18:55.360 --> 18:58.470
Picking His Nose And Eating Cupcakes.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.650
There Was A Fire Alarm,

19:00.800 --> 19:04.130
And Before Exiting The Classroom,

19:04.270 --> 19:06.950
Carter Downed Three Cupcakes With Such Purpose,

19:07.100 --> 19:11.140
It W Almost Like He Was Gonna Put Out The Fire Himself.

19:11.380 --> 19:15.220
He Almost Looked... Heroic.

19:15.370 --> 19:16.630
But The Thing That Kills Me,

19:16.790 --> 19:19.350
Besides Writing The Comic In The First Place,

19:19.510 --> 19:21.740
Is That I Forgot About It.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.700
I Completely Forgot About Something

19:23.850 --> 19:27.360
That Had Suca Major Impact On This Guy'S Life.

19:27.510 --> 19:29.080
Well,my Dad Used To Say

19:29.220 --> 19:32.130
That Our Greatest Blessing Is The Ability To Forget.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.560
Of Course,he'D Say That

19:33.710 --> 19:36.060
Mostly After Forgetting His Sister'S Birthday

19:36.210 --> 19:38.550
Or His Wedding Anniversary...

19:38.690 --> 19:41.130
Or My Name.

19:42.410 --> 19:46.690
Yeah... You Eventually Forgave Him,right?

19:46.850 --> 19:48.840
Not So Much.

20:06.550 --> 20:08.540
What Do You Want, Ray?

20:08.700 --> 20:10.750
You Remember My Buddy, Matt Lauche?

20:10.900 --> 20:12.950
Hater Of All Things Good.

20:14.670 --> 20:17.380
I Really Like What You'Ve Done With The Place.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.710
These Are Some D.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.410
They Got Drawers And Everything.

20:21.570 --> 20:23.400
They Got A Water Cooler,too.

20:23.550 --> 20:26.260
Imagine The Monday Morning Chitchat.

20:26.770 --> 20:29.930
What Are You Doing Here,ray? I'M Not In The Mood.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.250
It'S Bad Enough I Got To Go To Dinner

20:31.400 --> 20:32.160
With You On Friday.

20:32.310 --> 20:33.510
You Got To Show Up Where I Work,too?

20:33.660 --> 20:36.080
I Heard You Were Going After The Elementary School Job.

20:36.220 --> 20:37.510
I Just Thought You Might Want Some Advice

20:37.660 --> 20:41.220
On How To Land A Big Fish From The Big Cat.

20:41.360 --> 20:44.070
Why Don'T You Save Your Yapping For Friday Night?

20:44.230 --> 20:46.400
Rumor Is You Learned To Chew With Your Mouth Closed.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.010
I'M Looking Forward To Seeing That For Myself.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.110
Saw Your Truck Outside.

20:51.260 --> 20:53.760
It Still Reads "Latekka Landscaping."

20:53.910 --> 20:56.170
Isn'T One Failed Business Enough?

20:56.940 --> 20:59.290
How'S Janet,by The Way?

21:00.120 --> 21:01.940
What'S It To Ya?

21:02.090 --> 21:03.400
I Don'T Know. You And Janet?

21:03.540 --> 21:06.540
I Just Don'T Get It. I Mean,come On,man.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.290
I Mean,dating Her Is Like,uh,

21:08.450 --> 21:10.450
Eating Pizza With A Knife And Fork.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.280
<i>It'S Just Not Something You Do Unless You Really Have To.</i>

21:15.540 --> 21:16.540
It'S Only A Sucker Punch

21:16.690 --> 21:19.350
If You Don'T Know It'S Coming,right,lauche? Yeah.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.150
Well,it'S Coming In Two Seconds-

21:22.450 --> 21:24.440
One To The Gut...

21:24.580 --> 21:26.960
Followed By A Right Across The Temple.

21:30.310 --> 21:31.080
Whoa,whoa,hey,hey.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.970
Come On,bro.

21:33.130 --> 21:35.080
Don'T Key The Ferrari.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.400
No,no,no,no.

21:45.440 --> 21:46.740
Now How Could I Possibly Share A Meal With You

21:46.900 --> 21:49.210
When You Just Viciously Attacked My Good Friend?

21:49.360 --> 21:51.340
Get Outta Here.

21:52.090 --> 21:53.680
Come On.

21:56.410 --> 22:00.320
You Know,hannah And Janet Are Gonna So Disappointed.

22:01.190 --> 22:03.020
Enjoy Your Friday Night.

22:03.190 --> 22:05.410
I Know I Will.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.390
Ikey?

22:35.330 --> 22:37.260
What Are You Doing Here?

22:39.070 --> 22:41.040
Can We Talk?

22:54.940 --> 22:56.280
Janet,wait,talk To Me.

22:56.430 --> 23:00.080
What'S There To Talk About? Dinner'S Off. End Of Story.

23:00.230 --> 23:01.600
This Isn'T All My Fault.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.460
Right. Matt Lauche'S Face Is To Blame,too,

23:04.610 --> 23:06.370
Being That It Got In The Way Of Your Fist And All.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.440
He And Big Cat Showed Up Looking For A Fight,plain And Simple.

23:09.590 --> 23:12.090
And You Just Had To Give It To Him?

23:12.240 --> 23:15.580
What Could He Possibly Have Said To Get You So Corked?

23:17.800 --> 23:19.380
It Doesn'T Matter.

23:19.540 --> 23:23.060
But This Double Date You Ruined? It Was Important To Me.

23:23.210 --> 23:24.700
For So Many Years, I'Ve Played The Third Wheel

23:24.840 --> 23:26.370
With Hannah And Her Boyfriends.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.650
Just Once,i Wanted To Sit Across From Her In A Booth

23:29.790 --> 23:32.170
<i>With Somebody By My Side For A Change.</i>

23:32.670 --> 23:35.340
Now That'S Never Gonna Happen.

23:36.830 --> 23:39.340
God,i Am Such A Moron.

23:39.490 --> 23:41.630
Ray Played Me Like A Guitar.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.810
Actually,he Played You Like A Ukulele.

23:43.960 --> 23:44.880
How Do You Figure?

23:45.030 --> 23:48.660
Ukuleles Are Goofier. Easier To Play.

23:51.690 --> 23:54.250
Ikey Called For A Tribunal.

23:54.780 --> 23:55.470
What?

23:55.630 --> 23:57.380
I'M Not Sure I Wanna Hear This.

23:57.540 --> 23:59.180
What'S A Tribunal?

23:59.330 --> 24:01.400
Uh... A Committee

24:01.550 --> 24:04.040
That Hears An Argument And Makes A Judgment.

24:04.190 --> 24:07.390
It'S His Right, And He Wishes To Exercise It.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.190
Ikey'S Got No Rights.

24:09.340 --> 24:10.630
He Has No Standing Anymore.

24:10.810 --> 24:12.750
He Wants To Be Heard,owen,

24:12.900 --> 24:16.360
And I Think We Owe Him That Much.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.860
Well,i Don'T Care What He Has To Say.

24:21.230 --> 24:24.230
No String Of Words Is Gonna Change What He Did.

24:27.550 --> 24:30.110
How Many Times Do I Have To Explain This? I'M Just Looking For An Explanation

24:30.270 --> 24:33.240
That Makes Sense,ray. I Went Down To Best Friend Windows

24:33.380 --> 24:35.870
To Talk About The Elementary School Job.

24:36.030 --> 24:37.340
I Just Figured With The Dinner And All,

24:37.500 --> 24:39.540
It Was Time For A Peace Offering.

24:39.690 --> 24:41.400
Eddie Obviously Doesn'T Want My Help.

24:41.570 --> 24:44.650
I Know Eddie Has A Short Fuse, But Why Would He Punch Matt?

24:44.790 --> 24:47.400
Who Knows? I Mean,the Guy Threw His Own Partner Through

24:47.560 --> 24:49.650
<i>Their Storefront Window.</i>

24:49.800 --> 24:53.180
Swear To Me You Did Nothing To Provoke Him?

24:54.260 --> 24:56.170
I Swear.

24:56.320 --> 25:00.130
It Was Just My Bum Luck To Find Eddie Latekka In A Foul Mood.

25:00.310 --> 25:02.480
I Mean,i Hardly Blame The Guy,though.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.180
After What I Did To His Landscaping Business?

25:05.420 --> 25:07.580
He'S Got A Legitimate Bone To Pick.

25:09.060 --> 25:10.930
I Just Thought We Were Past That.

25:11.100 --> 25:11.940
It'S Just Really Sad.

25:12.110 --> 25:12.800
I Mean, Janet Was Looking Forward

25:12.950 --> 25:15.130
To Letting Bygones Be Bygones.

25:15.270 --> 25:17.780
Yeah,so Was I, Haah Jane.

25:26.730 --> 25:28.710
Owen. Hey.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.630
Where Is Everybody?

25:30.940 --> 25:33.210
Uh,ronnie'S In His Room.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.400
Nick Said He Wouldn'T Be Home For Dinner.

25:35.530 --> 25:37.680
He'S With Eddie And Phil.

25:38.420 --> 25:39.990
Some Kind Of Gathering.

25:40.140 --> 25:41.130
You Gonna Be There,too?

25:41.290 --> 25:43.260
And Miss Your Salisbury Steak?

25:43.420 --> 25:45.390
I Don'T Think So.

25:49.410 --> 25:50.820
Owen?

25:52.830 --> 25:55.720
I Ever Tell You How Sneaky Pete Got His Name?

25:59.320 --> 26:01.690
Hey,carter, It'S,uh,nick Garrett Again.

26:01.850 --> 26:03.640
I'M Gonna Drop Off Our Proposal Later Today,

26:03.800 --> 26:06.940
And I Was Just Kinda Hoping That If You Were Around,

26:07.090 --> 26:09.610
Maybe We Could Talk While I'M There.

26:10.100 --> 26:13.340
Let Me Know. You Got My Number. Thanks.

26:19.710 --> 26:20.730
Yeah,i Remember When Those Comics

26:20.900 --> 26:23.090
First Appeared In The Cafeteria.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.710
I,for One,didn'T Think They Were Funny At All.

26:25.860 --> 26:28.820
Oh,they Were Funny. They Were Just About Me,was The Problem.

26:28.980 --> 26:30.690
And Then He Goes And Writes His Book,

26:30.830 --> 26:32.110
Which Was Lly The Equivalent

26:32.250 --> 26:34.810
Of Undoing His Belt, Yanking Down His Pants

26:34.960 --> 26:38.620
And Taking A Squat On The Town. Now He Wants You To Give Him

26:38.770 --> 26:42.240
The Responsibility Of Putting Windows In The Very Building

26:42.380 --> 26:45.260
That Is There To Educate The Children Of Thisown.

26:45.410 --> 26:49.940
So,uh,what Did You Have In Mind,raymond?

26:59.580 --> 27:01.610
I Dropped Off The Proposal At Carter'S.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.660
Well,did You See Him?

27:02.830 --> 27:04.860
No,they Said He Was Gone For The Day.

27:05.010 --> 27:06.930
He'S Doing A Party. I Still Can'T Believe

27:07.080 --> 27:10.110
That Miserable Wretch Is A Kiddie Clown.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.130
Owen.

27:16.270 --> 27:19.780
I Still Say This Tribunal Thing Is A Bad Idea,

27:19.930 --> 27:22.870
But The Commander Is Very Convincing.

27:25.030 --> 27:26.990
Well,i'M Glad You Came.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.450
Okay, We'Re Ready For You Now,ikey.

27:41.590 --> 27:44.320
What'S He Doing Here? Don'T Mind Him,ikey,

27:44.470 --> 27:47.420
Just Say What You Came To Say.

28:00.940 --> 28:03.280
Minus The Last Few Months,

28:04.020 --> 28:07.300
We'Ve Been Friends For Almost 20 Years.

28:07.450 --> 28:08.390
I Know That 'Cause Every Time

28:08.550 --> 28:11.640
I Look In The Mirror And See My Bent Nose,

28:12.040 --> 28:14.070
It Reminds Me How I Met Owen Rowan'S Elbow

28:14.220 --> 28:16.360
On The Playground Before I Met The Rest Of Him.

28:16.510 --> 28:19.930
I'D Just Moved To The Ridge. I Didn'T Know Jack From Jill.

28:20.070 --> 28:22.960
I Remember You Felt So Bad Afterwards.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.090
Uh,i Was Just Some Grimy Kid

28:24.250 --> 28:27.090
With A Wad Of Toilet Paper Up His Nose,but,uh...

28:27.890 --> 28:30.550
You Introduced Me To Your Friends,

28:30.700 --> 28:33.240
And That Changed Everything.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.340
I Wasn'T David Eichorn Anymore.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.890
I Was Ikey.

28:40.290 --> 28:42.460
That'S How Owen Introduced Me To You Guys-

28:42.620 --> 28:44.120
As "Ikey."

28:45.280 --> 28:47.600
And Ikey'S All I'Ve Ever Been.

28:47.770 --> 28:49.860
You Guys Are A Part Of Me.

28:50.670 --> 28:53.260
Nick, Remember These Skid Marks?

28:53.410 --> 28:55.070
Huh? Yeah.

28:55.220 --> 28:57.480
When You Dared Me To Ride Down North Hill Road On My Bike

28:57.640 --> 28:59.100
During The Storm.

28:59.750 --> 29:03.050
And This Gimpy Pinkie Finger, Huh,phys?

29:03.210 --> 29:05.320
I Got This From Those Homemade Firecrackers

29:05.470 --> 29:08.030
You Told Me Were 100% Safe.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.090
I Got My Man Eddie Latekka, Of Course,

29:10.230 --> 29:12.680
To Thank For My Best Pickup Line.

29:12.820 --> 29:13.720
And I Tell All The Girlies

29:13.870 --> 29:16.600
I Got This In Desert Storm From A Bayonet

29:16.750 --> 29:20.830
When,actually,you Just Nicked Me With A Hedge Trimmer.

29:32.360 --> 29:37.430
I Know We'Ve Come A Long Way Since That Playground,owen.

29:37.580 --> 29:41.040
You Brought Me Into The Fold Then.

29:41.910 --> 29:45.280
I Hope That You'Ll Let Me Back In Now.

29:47.520 --> 29:51.600
I Can'T Lose You Guys Any More Than I Can Lose My Own Skin.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.860
You'Re Who I Am!

29:54.010 --> 29:56.770
I'M Ikey Because Of You Guys.

29:57.200 --> 30:00.620
And While Maybe Ikey Ain'T So Much...

30:03.360 --> 30:08.150
He'S A Lot Less When He Ain'T Got You Guys In His Life.

30:17.330 --> 30:20.330
I Guess That'S All I Gotta Say.

30:33.030 --> 30:35.000
I Vote No.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.180
Oh,fancy!

30:43.340 --> 30:44.730
I Figured I Should Wear 'Em At Least Once

30:44.880 --> 30:48.310
Before I Return 'Em. Oh,they Pinch Like A Bear Trap,

30:48.460 --> 30:50.780
<i>But They Look So Good.</i>

30:51.150 --> 30:53.910
I Wish Things Hadn'T Gone Sideways Like They Did.

30:54.270 --> 30:56.170
Well, Boys Can Be Stupid.

30:57.050 --> 30:58.740
They'Re Not Gonna Change Overnight,

30:58.900 --> 31:01.470
Especially Not Eddie Latekka.

31:01.630 --> 31:03.170
I See. This Is Eddie'S Fault.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.870
Well... Yeah.

31:06.010 --> 31:07.520
You Know,ray'S The One Who Went Into Eddie'S Store

31:07.670 --> 31:10.460
With The Obvious Chip On His Shoulder. Actually,ray Went Into Best Friend Windows

31:10.620 --> 31:14.970
To Help Eddie Land A Window Job. He Was There To Be A Friend.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.350
Friend?

31:16.500 --> 31:17.420
Eddie Wouldn'T Even Need The Job

31:17.570 --> 31:20.590
If Ray Hadn'T Stolen All His Landscaping Clients.

31:20.940 --> 31:24.510
Whoa. Are We Fighting Over Boys?

31:25.230 --> 31:27.270
????

31:28.080 --> 31:30.090
I'M Sorry. I Didn'T Mean To Attack Eddie.

31:30.230 --> 31:32.610
No,it'S My Bad. I'M Sure You'Re Right About Ray.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.040
Anyways,the Person To Really Blame Is That Tool,matt Lauche.

31:36.210 --> 31:37.870
According To Ray, Matt Didn'T Say A Word.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.950
I Nd That Hard To Believe. Matt Lauche Is A Jerk.

31:41.110 --> 31:44.080
If He'S Not Making Fun Of My Ass,he'S Grabbing It.

31:44.210 --> 31:45.070
If There'S One Thing I'M Sure Of,

31:45.230 --> 31:46.950
It'S That Eddie Hit Him Because The Guy Served It.

31:47.090 --> 31:48.250
I Don'T Know Why Ray Would Lie About It.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.670
He'S Never Lied To Me In Our Four Years Together,not Once.

31:51.810 --> 31:53.650
Not That You Know Of.

31:55.670 --> 31:57.620
Is There Something You'Re Not Telling Me?

31:57.770 --> 31:59.240
No. No.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.160
Well,then Why All Of A Sudden The Problem With Ray?

32:01.310 --> 32:03.520
I Mean,where Is This Coming From? I'M Just Saying...

32:03.660 --> 32:07.050
Saying What? Excuse Me If I Can'T Always Be Hannah'S Yes-Girl.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.580
What Are You Even Talking About? Hannah'S Yes-Girl?

32:09.740 --> 32:12.120
I Have Played The Third Wheel With You Long Enough To Know

32:12.270 --> 32:13.520
That You Have A Wicked Blind Spot When It Comes

32:13.660 --> 32:14.910
To The Men In Your Life.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.240
It'S Why Right Now You Can'T See What A Slimeball Big Cat Can Be,

32:18.390 --> 32:19.920
And That'S Why Ten Years Ago You Didn'T See How Badly

32:20.060 --> 32:22.340
Nick Wanted To Leave The Ridge.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.810
Didn'T You Just Get Your Very First Boyfriend?

32:28.970 --> 32:29.990
What Is That Supposed To Mean?

32:30.130 --> 32:31.340
It Means Why Don'T You Try Dating Someone For More

32:31.480 --> 32:34.500
Than A Couple Months Before You Come At Me With This Crap?

32:34.660 --> 32:35.570
I Don'T Know If You Think This Is How Girls

32:35.740 --> 32:38.580
With Boyfriends Act- Blindly Defending Their Men-

32:38.720 --> 32:42.410
But Trust Me,the Only Thing You'Re Acting Like Is A Rookie.

32:42.970 --> 32:44.310
I Think I Should Go.

32:44.470 --> 32:46.780
I Think You Should,too.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.020
Dude?

33:00.180 --> 33:02.780
I'M Dying Here. What'S The Word?

33:04.090 --> 33:06.200
I'M Sorry,ikey.

33:07.430 --> 33:09.260
I Don'T Understand.

33:09.410 --> 33:11.590
Everything You Said Hit Home.

33:12.530 --> 33:15.210
Owen'S Just Not Ready.

33:16.600 --> 33:19.040
What Am I Supposed To Do Now?

33:23.240 --> 33:24.850
It'S A Terrible Thing, Physical Phil,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.900
Having No Friends.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.770
Do You Think I'M Being Unreasonable?

33:46.910 --> 33:48.770
Well,fair Is Fair,o.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.910
He Said His Piece. You Said Yours.

33:51.060 --> 33:54.300
I Think By Punishing Ikey, You'Re Just Punishing Yourself.

33:54.450 --> 33:57.160
No One Makes You Laugh Like That Idiot.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.570
What Is It?

34:01.710 --> 34:03.470
I Just Talked To Lars At Public Works.

34:03.620 --> 34:05.550
Apparently,big Cat Cataldo Is Getting

34:05.700 --> 34:07.240
The Elementary School Contract. Big Cat?

34:07.380 --> 34:08.940
Big Cat.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.239
????

34:18.730 --> 34:20.460
I Still Think This Is A Bad Idea,nick.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.320
I Gotta Give It One More Shot.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.880
I Owe Eddie That Much. It'S Gonna Take A Miracle.

34:25.020 --> 34:26.739
You Denied Carter Love When You Denied Him

34:26.900 --> 34:28.860
His "Paradise By The Dashboard Light" Duet

34:29.010 --> 34:31.020
With Nicole Van Dusen.

34:33.860 --> 34:35.909
Butter,sugar, Eggs And Flour.

34:36.070 --> 34:38.520
Frosting,sprinkles, Superpower.

34:39.429 --> 34:40.460
Good.

34:42.730 --> 34:44.460
Let'S Go.

34:44.610 --> 34:48.159
Now I Want Everyone To Secure Your Invisible Parachutes,okay?

34:48.310 --> 34:51.580
Because The Magic Carpet Is Flying Over Bubbleville!

34:51.730 --> 34:55.570
Where The Princess Has Been Captured By The Evil-

34:57.340 --> 34:59.740
Turtle On A Snare Drum.

34:59.890 --> 35:01.190
All Right,katie,

35:01.340 --> 35:03.860
Here'S Your Sword. Now Does Everyone Have A Sword? Yeah.

35:04.020 --> 35:07.070
Good. Okay,kids, Plumpy Needs To Take A Break.

35:07.220 --> 35:08.730
I'Ll Be Right Back.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.370
What Are You Doing Here? It'S Over.

35:14.530 --> 35:15.770
I'M Not Here Because Of The Job.

35:15.930 --> 35:18.880
I'M Here Because... I Wanted To Say I'M Sorry,

35:19.030 --> 35:21.660
And I Wanted,uh, To Give You This.

35:22.540 --> 35:23.570
What Is It?
