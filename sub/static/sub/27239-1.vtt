08:13.035 --> 08:15.246
Ever take a homicide picture before, son?

08:15.329 --> 08:18.374
- Well, at least he won't be movin' on us.
- That's for sure.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.877
I want you to cover every angle.
Do you hear me? Every angle.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.628
- Get goin'.
- Yes, sir.

08:22.712 --> 08:25.298
Uh, you boys move on back now. Okay?

08:25.381 --> 08:28.634
Came all this way to build us a factory,

08:28.718 --> 08:30.720
make somethin' out of this town.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.265
Look what it got him.

08:36.767 --> 08:37.768
Yeah.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.355
Sam.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.609
Did he have a wallet? Identification?
Anything like that?

08:44.692 --> 08:48.154
That's the first thing I looked for, Chief,
but whoever fixed him must've took it.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.447
Nothin'.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.743
- Any witnesses?
- I mean, not even a cat.

08:56.037 --> 08:57.705
How long has he been dead?

08:57.788 --> 09:00.166
Oh, less than an hour.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.001
- Less than an hour.
- Maybe half that.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.171
Maybe half.

09:09.759 --> 09:11.677
Could've been a hitchhiker.

09:12.345 --> 09:15.848
You check both ends of town. You check
the depot, you check the pool hall. Okay?

09:15.932 --> 09:17.850
Uh, pool hall closes at one o'clock, Chief.

09:17.934 --> 09:20.269
- I said check it, Sam.
- Yes, sir.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.268
On your feet, boy.

10:48.024 --> 10:49.650
I mean now!

10:58.909 --> 11:01.454
Against that wall. Get them hands high!

11:01.537 --> 11:04.040
You spread them fingers.
I wanna count all ten.

11:07.293 --> 11:09.754
Yeah, you move 'fore I tell you to, boy...

11:10.755 --> 11:12.757
by God, I'm gonna clean your plow.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.241
That's pretty fat there, ain't it, boy?

11:39.909 --> 11:41.118
Huh?

11:44.288 --> 11:46.749
Now, outside there's a police car.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.834
You gonna pick up that bag,

11:48.918 --> 11:52.046
you're gonna walk out,
you gon' plant yourself in the back,

11:52.588 --> 11:55.925
and you're gonna be
a real nice, quiet boy all the way in.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.427
You hear?

12:18.572 --> 12:19.949
Come on, boy.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.535
Move it!

12:34.797 --> 12:36.006
Chief here?

12:37.842 --> 12:40.052
- Hey, what's up, Sam?
- Chief?

12:40.136 --> 12:41.554
What's goin' on?

12:42.555 --> 12:43.556
Sam?

13:16.922 --> 13:18.757
- Wood.
- Yes, sir?

13:19.592 --> 13:22.511
When's the last time I asked Courtney
to get oil for this damn thing?

13:24.096 --> 13:26.140
Uh, last Wednesday.

13:26.223 --> 13:29.810
Would you be kind enough to go outside
and remind him what day it is today?

13:31.353 --> 13:33.856
Well, uh, how about the prisoner here?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.484
Don't you worry 'bout him.

13:37.443 --> 13:38.569
Got a name, boy?

13:39.904 --> 13:41.113
Virgil Tibbs.

13:43.157 --> 13:44.450
Virgil.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.662
Well...

13:48.746 --> 13:52.041
I don't think we're gonna have any trouble,
are we, Virgil?

13:53.584 --> 13:55.586
No trouble at all.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.512
Oh, you can go now, Sam.

14:05.679 --> 14:06.889
Yes, sir.

14:12.436 --> 14:14.355
What'd you hit him with?

14:14.438 --> 14:15.856
Hit whom?

14:16.440 --> 14:18.192
"Whom"?

14:18.275 --> 14:20.194
"Whom." What are you?
Are you a Northern boy?

14:20.277 --> 14:22.279
What's a Northern boy like you
doin' all the way down here?

14:23.531 --> 14:25.199
I was waiting for the train.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.618
Well, now, there ain't no trains
this time of mornin'.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.162
Tuesdays only. 4:05 to Memphis.

14:30.246 --> 14:31.956
You say.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.547
Well ‒ All right. You say right.

14:51.392 --> 14:54.645
All right ‒ Virgil.

14:56.355 --> 14:58.148
Oh!

14:58.232 --> 15:00.067
Now, look.

15:02.820 --> 15:06.073
I try to run a nice, clean, safe town here.

15:06.657 --> 15:10.369
A town where a man can sneeze
and not get his brains beat out.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.955
- You follow me?
- Yes.

15:14.373 --> 15:16.792
Why don't you tell me
how you killed Mr. Colbert,

15:16.875 --> 15:19.712
and I promise you
you're gonna feel a whole lot better.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.424
Not now!

15:39.064 --> 15:41.066
I was visiting my mother.

15:42.151 --> 15:45.571
I came in on the 12:35 from Brownsville.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.531
I was waiting to go out...

15:48.532 --> 15:50.117
on the 4:05.

15:53.329 --> 15:54.747
Mm-hmm.

16:05.341 --> 16:06.425
Yeah.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.261
Meanwhile,
you just killed yourself a white man,

16:09.345 --> 16:11.305
just about the most important white man
we got around here,

16:11.388 --> 16:12.931
and picked yourself up
a couple hundred dollars.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.768
I earned that money,
ten hours a day, seven days a week.

16:15.851 --> 16:18.562
Colored can't earn that kinda money, boy.
Hell, that's more than I make in a month.

16:18.646 --> 16:20.648
Now, where did you earn it?

16:21.607 --> 16:23.567
- Philadelphia.
- Mississippi?

16:23.651 --> 16:24.735
Pennsylvania.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.363
Now, just what do you do up there
in little ol' Pennsylvania, earn that kinda money?

16:27.446 --> 16:29.406
I'm a police officer.

17:08.654 --> 17:09.863
Oh, yeah.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.502
- Wood!
- Yes, sir!

17:26.338 --> 17:28.257
Did you question this man
before you brought him in?

17:28.339 --> 17:29.341
No, sir.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.097
Would you mind takin' a look at that?

17:39.351 --> 17:42.604
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

17:45.274 --> 17:47.818
All right. I'll check on this wise city boy
from Philadelphia.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.279
- You'll take him outside and hold him.
- Yes, sir.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.325
May I suggest that you call my chief
rather than send a wire or anything.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.202
I mean, it would be quicker.

17:57.995 --> 18:00.539
And I'll pay for the call.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.584
Did you hear him?
Did you hear him say he'd pay for the call?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.878
How much do they pay you
to do their police work?

18:06.837 --> 18:10.048
$162.39 per week.

18:11.133 --> 18:15.387
$162.39 a week.

18:15.471 --> 18:17.264
Well, boy!

18:17.347 --> 18:19.683
You take him outside, Wood,
but treat him easy.

18:19.767 --> 18:24.062
Because a man that makes $162.39 a week,

18:24.146 --> 18:26.523
man, we do not want to ruffle him!

18:27.649 --> 18:29.401
No, sir.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.286
Courtney.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.081
Would you try and get me long distance?

18:52.800 --> 18:55.219
Police business, honey.
Chief's on the line.

18:57.554 --> 19:01.225
Oh, no, sirree, boy. He catch you listenin' in,
he'll run your butt around the block.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.310
- He don't panic me none.
- Well...

19:05.604 --> 19:07.105
- Where's the chief?
- Ah, Charlie.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.525
- You got the pictures of the dead man there, huh?
- Sure do.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.860
I got him top, bottom, sideways,
you name it.

19:11.944 --> 19:15.113
- Good. I'll take 'em, son.
- Well, I wanna give 'em to the chief.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.991
- I said I'd take 'em, Charlie.
- Do like he tells ya, Charlie.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.161
Well, somebody owes me
some money for those.

19:21.245 --> 19:24.206
I had to buy paper and film and developin'.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.041
Yeah, well, that's all right, Charlie.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.836
You just bill the department.
Everything will be taken care of.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.880
God Almighty.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.507
Sure looks bad.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.887
May I see the man
I'm supposed to have killed?

19:40.180 --> 19:42.182
Sure. I don't know why not.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.144
Hey, Sam, he's finished talkin'.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.192
Here's the photos of the dead man, Chief.

19:52.276 --> 19:53.986
Okay.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.072
I got your chief on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.497
Hello. Yes, sir.

20:05.581 --> 20:09.376
I'm sorry to have gotten you involved in this.
I really had no choice.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.755
Mm-hmm. Yes, sir.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.550
Oh, you can't be serious, sir.

20:16.633 --> 20:20.137
I mean, even if I could be of some help,
they wouldn't want it.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.099
No, sir, I-I'm not prejudiced.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.271
Yes, sir, I-I'm a police officer
and they're police officers, but ‒

20:36.904 --> 20:38.280
Hello, this is Gillespie.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.657
Yes, sir, yes. Well, I ‒

20:40.741 --> 20:42.200
You don't say.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.079
He's your number one homicide expert.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.081
Well, my, my, my.

20:48.165 --> 20:51.752
Well, I don't think we need any help though.
I think we can wrap this thing up ourselves.

20:51.835 --> 20:54.212
Yes, sir, but I do wanna thank you

20:54.296 --> 20:58.008
for offerin' me such a powerful
piece of manpower as Virgil Tibbs.

20:58.926 --> 21:00.594
Yes, sir. Thank you.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.095
Yeah. Good-bye now.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.560
Oh, it's all there.
We paid for the phone call ourselves.

21:14.483 --> 21:17.402
Well, now, you are the ‒
you are the number one homicide expert.

21:17.486 --> 21:18.403
That's right.

21:18.487 --> 21:21.365
Boy, I bet you get to look
at a lot of dead bodies, don't you?

21:21.448 --> 21:23.241
Lots.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.409
Well...

21:27.204 --> 21:28.288
"Well" what?

21:28.372 --> 21:30.916
Well, I ‒ No, I just thought maybe, uh ‒

21:31.917 --> 21:34.503
maybe you wouldn't mind
takin' a look at this one.

21:34.586 --> 21:35.796
No, thanks.

21:36.630 --> 21:39.800
- Well, why not, expert?
- Because I've got a train to catch.

21:39.883 --> 21:42.636
Now, wait a minute.
That train don't leave till 12 o'clock noon!

21:42.719 --> 21:46.306
Look, they pay you $162.39 a week
just to look at bodies.

21:46.390 --> 21:49.017
- Why can't you look at this one?
- Why can't you look at it for yourself?

21:49.101 --> 21:50.894
Because I'm not an expert...

21:51.812 --> 21:52.938
Officer.

22:02.531 --> 22:05.784
Ten cents, ten million dollars.

22:05.867 --> 22:08.120
Just doesn't matter
when a man's time comes.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.997
Mm-hmm.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.208
You know, I could give him
a nicer service right here in Sparta

22:13.291 --> 22:15.252
than he could ever get
up there in Chicago.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.546
And at half the price too.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.132
I got a rosewood casket out there ‒

22:22.050 --> 22:24.886
Ted Ulam, Chief.
We haven't had the pleasure.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.555
That's for sure.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.434
He's with me.

22:33.437 --> 22:34.688
Hello, Doc.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.734
Yep.

22:46.491 --> 22:48.785
Well...

22:48.869 --> 22:50.162
Uh...

22:51.538 --> 22:53.248
you wanna look at it?

23:21.401 --> 23:23.403
New manicure. That's good.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.161
That's very good.

23:47.135 --> 23:50.138
- I'll need a few things.
- Such as?

23:50.222 --> 23:52.057
Ammonium hydrosulfide,

23:52.140 --> 23:54.643
benzedine, superoxide of hydrogen...

23:56.728 --> 23:59.606
copper powder, distilled water...

24:10.575 --> 24:12.619
a six-inch celluloid scale...

24:13.787 --> 24:14.955
a thermometer...

24:16.456 --> 24:17.874
some tweezers...

24:19.835 --> 24:21.128
calipers...

24:21.211 --> 24:22.754
and some toothpicks.

24:22.838 --> 24:25.841
Toothpicks? Copper?
What's goin' on here, Chief?

24:25.924 --> 24:27.968
Who is this boy anyway?

24:28.051 --> 24:30.387
I asked him to look at the body.
That's who he is.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.807
It's 4:45. What time was this man killed?

24:33.890 --> 24:35.809
Well, Sam Wood found him on the street
about 3:00 a.m.

24:35.892 --> 24:38.478
The doctor here says it's possible
he was killed an hour earlier.

24:39.855 --> 24:41.231
At 2:00?

24:41.314 --> 24:42.983
Maybe a little later ‒

24:43.066 --> 24:45.652
2:15, 2:30.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.821
Would you feel the face and jaw, please?

24:48.947 --> 24:51.283
Am I mistaken, or has rigor begun?

24:52.492 --> 24:53.577
It has.

24:55.912 --> 24:58.874
You'll notice, too, that postmortem lividity
is present here in the lower portions.

24:58.957 --> 25:02.043
So the time of death really has to be earlier,
wouldn't you say?

25:04.921 --> 25:08.133
Well, we'll be able to pinpoint that
as soon as I get a thermometer.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.886
As you know,
the loss of heat from the brain

25:10.969 --> 25:14.639
is the most reliable way
of determining time of death.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.059
Right, Chief?

25:19.895 --> 25:21.438
Oh, yeah.

25:25.317 --> 25:26.526
Well...

25:28.987 --> 25:31.406
which one of you gentlemen will assist me?

25:42.334 --> 25:43.543
Ulam s ‒

25:43.627 --> 25:45.295
It's for you, Chief.

25:48.632 --> 25:50.508
Yeah, talk to me.

25:50.592 --> 25:51.801
When?

25:52.886 --> 25:54.596
Oh, good. Yeah, yeah, right away.

25:54.679 --> 25:57.265
I've got a runaway suspect.
Boy, I gotta go.

25:58.183 --> 26:01.561
Now, listen, you. Anything he wants,
man, you better see that he gets it.

26:06.691 --> 26:08.693
Where can I wash my hands?

27:09.754 --> 27:12.757
Come on! Come on, get up here!

27:19.806 --> 27:21.558
He can't run! There you go!

27:31.234 --> 27:32.777
Come on now, dogs! Go!

27:32.861 --> 27:34.779
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah!

27:43.330 --> 27:45.749
This here is Shagbag, you hear?

27:45.832 --> 27:47.876
He's headed for the river.

27:47.959 --> 27:50.754
The river, you hear?
He's gonna be in Arkansas.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.256
Oh, shoot.

28:00.847 --> 28:03.850
Go! Go!

29:37.694 --> 29:39.779
Okay. I got him.

30:46.387 --> 30:47.972
Mrs. Colbert.

30:49.307 --> 30:50.683
How is she taking it?

30:50.767 --> 30:53.770
Chief had to leave 'fore she got here.
She don't even know it yet.

31:01.486 --> 31:03.530
Hey, you can't go in there, boy!

31:08.701 --> 31:09.911
Mrs. Colbert?

31:09.994 --> 31:11.746
Where's my husband?

31:12.664 --> 31:13.790
What's happened to him?

31:13.873 --> 31:16.793
Why won't anybody here
tell me what's happened to him?

31:16.876 --> 31:19.420
Why won't anybody here tell me
what's happened to him?

31:19.504 --> 31:22.173
I have a right to know if he's hurt,
if he's been in an accident.

31:22.257 --> 31:24.175
I want to know if my husband is all right.

31:24.259 --> 31:26.427
Your husband is dead, Mrs. Colbert.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.850
Somebody killed him.

31:34.644 --> 31:36.646
We don't know who yet.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.076
No.

31:59.419 --> 32:00.962
It's ‒

32:03.631 --> 32:05.300
It's very hot in here.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.261
It's very hot in this room.

32:13.641 --> 32:14.851
Sit down.

32:16.311 --> 32:17.520
No.

32:42.629 --> 32:44.047
Would you ‒

32:47.467 --> 32:48.968
Would you...

32:50.553 --> 32:54.223
leave me alone for a few minutes, please?

33:46.025 --> 33:48.820
Well, Virgil, we don't need you
or your microscopes anymore.

33:48.903 --> 33:51.948
You can tell that to your chief.
We don't need him or you.

33:52.949 --> 33:55.159
- For the last time ‒
- Mrs. Colbert's in there.

33:56.911 --> 33:59.247
- I've already told her.
- I see.

34:00.248 --> 34:03.084
Here's the examination results from Ulam's.

34:03.167 --> 34:06.421
- Do you wanna know what I found?
- No. I don't need to look at 'em now.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.799
May I examine this prisoner?

34:09.882 --> 34:12.467
Yeah, you can look at him.
Come on, let him look. Go on.

34:34.782 --> 34:36.617
All right now, steady!

34:39.328 --> 34:40.746
You finished?

34:42.540 --> 34:43.916
Thank you.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.463
All right, Fryer, bring him with me.

34:48.545 --> 34:49.964
Come on, Harvey.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.846
- Now we grindin' corn!
- Hey, Court, you shoulda been there!

34:56.929 --> 34:59.974
If it hadn't been for them ol' radios,
we sure would've lost him goin' over that bridge.

35:00.057 --> 35:01.100
Yeah!

35:01.184 --> 35:03.394
That ol' boy highballin' that freight train
like to cut us off.

35:03.478 --> 35:06.105
Yeah, and ol' Charlie's hound dog
got loose about right that time ‒

35:06.189 --> 35:08.024
- Did he confess?
- Huh?

35:08.107 --> 35:11.736
The man you arrested. Did he confess?

35:11.819 --> 35:13.488
Well, I believe he will.

35:13.571 --> 35:15.782
Yes, sirree, I believe he will.

35:15.865 --> 35:18.409
I believe he will.

35:19.327 --> 35:22.205
- He's left-handed, isn't he?
- How would I know?

35:22.288 --> 35:24.499
Well, he seemed left-handed to me.

35:24.582 --> 35:27.835
- Uh-huh.
- I believe Harvey is a southpaw.

35:27.919 --> 35:29.462
Now, ain't he, Shagbag?

35:29.545 --> 35:32.131
What if he is? What's that make him?

35:33.674 --> 35:34.967
Innocent.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.137
Mrs. Colbert.

35:39.639 --> 35:41.474
There's just one more thing.

35:49.565 --> 35:50.691
Yeah.

35:51.442 --> 35:54.111
I picked it up, I tell ya.
He was already lyin' there.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.197
It was lyin' there next to him.

35:57.907 --> 36:00.243
I just picked it up, ma'am.

36:00.326 --> 36:01.994
- That's all I did.
- Shut up.

36:03.120 --> 36:06.123
- Get him outta here.
- Okay, come on, Harvey. Let's go.

36:19.470 --> 36:20.888
Mrs. Colbert, I, uh ‒

36:22.223 --> 36:25.726
I wonder if you'd mind if I'd have somebody
drive you over so you could, uh...

36:26.978 --> 36:28.771
complete the identification.

36:48.749 --> 36:49.959
Martin.

36:51.586 --> 36:53.546
I want you to take Mrs. Colbert
over to the funeral parlor.

36:53.629 --> 36:55.715
And, Wood, you run Virgil down the depot.

36:55.798 --> 36:57.008
Uh...

36:57.091 --> 37:00.469
Uh, Virg here, Chief,
he thinks that Harvey's innocent.

37:02.013 --> 37:03.472
Well, I'll be damned.

37:03.556 --> 37:05.766
Could I talk to you about it in private?

37:05.850 --> 37:07.435
No, you can't talk to me about it in private.

37:07.518 --> 37:10.479
I got Colbert's wallet right here in my hand
and we took it from Harvey Oberst.

37:10.563 --> 37:12.648
- You don't think he gave it to him, do ya?
- I don't know.

37:12.732 --> 37:16.861
But Oberst could've come along
after the crime, found it, picked it up.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.195
I don't know.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.364
That's what the boy said he did.

37:21.490 --> 37:24.118
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I say different.

37:24.201 --> 37:27.830
Well, when I examined the deceased,
it was obvious that the fatal blow

37:27.914 --> 37:30.416
was struck from an angle of 17 degrees
from the right,

37:30.499 --> 37:34.420
which makes it almost certain
the person who did it is right-handed.

37:34.503 --> 37:35.504
So what?

37:35.588 --> 37:38.883
Ol' Harv's left-handed, Chief.
Everybody in town knows that.

37:38.966 --> 37:42.678
Yeah, th-that's what we figured out, Chief.
Harvey's a lefty. Uh-huh.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.851
Well, you're pretty sure of yourself,
ain't ya, Virgil?

37:48.935 --> 37:51.187
Virgil, that's a funny name for a nigger boy
that comes from Philadelphia.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.688
What do they call you up there?

37:52.772 --> 37:55.775
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

37:55.858 --> 37:56.984
Mr. Tibbs!

37:57.068 --> 37:58.819
Well, Mr. Wood, take Mr. Tibbs,

37:58.903 --> 38:01.697
take him down to the depot,
and I mean, boy, like now!

38:11.749 --> 38:15.211
I'll have the FBI lab
send you the reports on this.

38:16.671 --> 38:18.839
Not that it'll make any difference.

38:19.882 --> 38:21.801
- I'll take that!
- No.

38:23.219 --> 38:25.054
No, you won't.

38:29.016 --> 38:32.186
I'm sending it in personally.

38:36.399 --> 38:38.109
My God.

38:41.195 --> 38:43.531
What kind of people are you?

38:44.699 --> 38:46.993
What kind of a place is this?

38:51.998 --> 38:54.500
My husband is dead.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.669
Somebody in this town killed him!

38:56.752 --> 38:58.838
I want you to find out who!

39:13.811 --> 39:15.479
You gonna give me that?

39:18.232 --> 39:19.608
No, I'm not.

39:23.029 --> 39:24.739
Wood, you take him...

39:25.614 --> 39:28.576
and you lock him up
for withholding evidence.

39:30.494 --> 39:32.913
Go on! Move!
Put him with his friend, Harvey Oberst.

39:42.465 --> 39:46.469
Well, Virgil, nobody threw your brains
to the hogs, that's for damn sure.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.765
Hold on there, Arnold. Open 'er up again.

39:50.848 --> 39:52.600
We got another customer.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.812
- Hey, man, not in here.
- That's all right.

39:56.896 --> 39:59.815
- Put him somewheres else!
- Don't push the panic button, Harvey.

39:59.899 --> 40:01.901
- You hear me? How come in here?
- Play it cool, boy.

40:01.984 --> 40:03.778
I thought that guy's
supposed to be a policeman.

40:03.861 --> 40:05.321
Hey!

40:05.404 --> 40:07.448
Hey!

40:13.704 --> 40:15.956
What you doin'
wearin' white man's clothes?

40:18.959 --> 40:20.795
Where you come from?

40:23.672 --> 40:25.382
You deaf or somethin'?

40:28.344 --> 40:29.386
Listen, I'm gettin' ‒

40:31.430 --> 40:33.265
Keep cool, Harvey.

40:39.021 --> 40:40.815
I'm on your side.

40:42.024 --> 40:44.026
Well, I don't need you!

40:44.110 --> 40:45.653
I'm all you've got.

40:55.079 --> 40:56.372
Police?

40:57.498 --> 40:59.500
You a cop?

41:01.043 --> 41:03.087
- You're a cop.
- Mm-hmm.

41:03.921 --> 41:05.172
Yeah?

41:06.549 --> 41:09.510
So how come they locked you up?
How come they'd go lock up a cop?

41:09.593 --> 41:12.012
Who said they locked me up?

41:12.096 --> 41:16.100
How come with all these empty cells back here,
they'd throw me in with you? You dig?

41:22.106 --> 41:23.315
Look.

41:24.733 --> 41:26.485
I already told 'em.

41:28.112 --> 41:30.656
I see this fella lyin' on the street there...

41:32.408 --> 41:34.743
and there's this wallet lyin' beside him.

41:37.663 --> 41:40.207
Boy, I mean,
I come into this world out of luck.

41:40.291 --> 41:43.586
Here's the first good thing
to come my way, and I pick it up.

41:45.838 --> 41:48.132
But when I see whose wallet it is...

41:49.300 --> 41:51.260
I mean, I start to sweat.

41:51.343 --> 41:54.805
But I heard about this new chief,
this "Gillepsbie,"

41:54.889 --> 41:57.308
got no more smile than a turnip.

41:57.391 --> 41:59.268
So I cut across the fields,
headin' for the line,

41:59.351 --> 42:03.314
and I got myself as far as the bridge
before "Gillepsbie" grabbed me.

42:04.106 --> 42:06.108
What time did you find the wallet?

42:07.651 --> 42:09.612
Well, I ain't got no watch, but...

42:10.654 --> 42:13.407
must've been after 2:00
by the courthouse clock.

42:13.490 --> 42:16.368
I'm interested in 11:00 to 2:00.
Where were you?

42:17.119 --> 42:19.121
Shootin' pool at Larry's Lounge.

42:19.205 --> 42:20.789
I got there about 10:00.

42:20.873 --> 42:23.959
- What time'd you leave?
- Not till closin'. Must've been 1:00.

42:24.043 --> 42:25.794
Anybody can swear for ya?

42:25.878 --> 42:28.130
Packy. Bert. Les.

42:32.259 --> 42:34.261
You ever been in trouble
with the police before?

42:37.264 --> 42:39.225
Come on.

42:39.308 --> 42:41.685
I can ask at the desk, you know.

42:46.982 --> 42:49.944
Well, they brought me in one time...

42:50.861 --> 42:52.655
on account of this Delores Purdy.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.114
On what charge?

42:58.285 --> 43:00.913
Well, uh, this Delores, see, uh...

43:02.706 --> 43:06.293
now, she's real proud
of what nature done for her, you know.

43:07.002 --> 43:08.963
And, uh ‒

43:09.046 --> 43:12.591
Well, we was on a date
up to Clarke's Point,

43:12.675 --> 43:13.884
and, uh...

43:14.677 --> 43:16.428
she says, uh...

43:18.347 --> 43:21.225
Anyway, she asks me, she says, uh,

43:21.308 --> 43:24.728
"Don't you think I got a classy build?"

43:24.812 --> 43:28.983
And I say, "Sure."
And so she starts to show me.

43:30.985 --> 43:32.987
But now, I didn't do nothin' wrong.

43:33.696 --> 43:36.824
I-I just didn't stop her
from tryin' to prove her point.

43:38.158 --> 43:41.203
Then this cop, Sam Wood,

43:41.287 --> 43:44.373
comes chargin' out of the bush
and hauls me in.

43:44.456 --> 43:46.417
He let you go, didn't he?

43:47.167 --> 43:49.086
He told me not to mess with her no more.

43:49.169 --> 43:51.088
She lives over on Third,
about a block from me.

43:51.171 --> 43:54.008
Traipsin' around the house in the altogether.
And after dark, with the lights on.

43:54.091 --> 43:57.094
Now, somebody sure
oughta make her stop doin' that.

43:57.886 --> 43:59.179
Come here.

44:03.058 --> 44:05.185
Let me see your right hand.

44:09.982 --> 44:11.817
- What you doin'?
- Hold still.

44:33.714 --> 44:36.717
All right now,
give him the waiver for false arrest.

44:37.968 --> 44:39.720
Forget it.

44:39.803 --> 44:42.890
I'm askin' you to sign it... please.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.729
Give him a pen. Give him a pen.

45:00.115 --> 45:01.825
All right, let him out.

45:08.957 --> 45:12.336
You'll be able to catch the 12:10 train.

45:15.255 --> 45:18.509
I don't think it would be a bad idea
to change the charge against Harvey Oberst.

45:18.592 --> 45:21.929
He was nowhere near the scene of the crime,
and I think he can prove it.

45:24.598 --> 45:27.059
Bet you could tell me the exact time
Colbert was killed too, can't ya?

45:27.142 --> 45:29.603
About 12:30,
while Harvey was still shooting pool.

45:29.686 --> 45:31.730
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I'll get it.

45:33.941 --> 45:36.985
There's cue chalk under his nails,
not dried blood.

45:37.069 --> 45:40.197
- Thank the Lord I don't live in Philadelphia.
- One more thing.

45:40.280 --> 45:42.658
Colbert wasn't killed
where the body was found.

45:42.741 --> 45:43.867
What do you mean?

45:43.951 --> 45:46.829
He was killed somewhere else,
then moved to Main Street.

45:57.881 --> 45:59.842
- Courtney.
- Yes, sir?

46:02.136 --> 46:04.930
Change the charge to theft.

46:05.013 --> 46:06.432
Do you mean Harv?

46:07.433 --> 46:10.144
Well, who the hell else
do we have back there?

46:10.227 --> 46:11.478
Yes, sir.

46:15.482 --> 46:16.692
Hey.

46:18.610 --> 46:20.612
Didn't I ask you to fix that gate?

46:21.697 --> 46:23.949
No, not me, sir.

46:24.032 --> 46:26.660
Must've been my brother, Harold.
He's on days.

46:26.743 --> 46:28.120
Harold.

46:40.883 --> 46:42.342
Police Department.

46:43.051 --> 46:44.970
Yes, he's here. Hold on, sir.

46:45.971 --> 46:47.556
Mayor's on the line, Chief.

47:52.412 --> 47:55.415
Now, Chief, what's all this
Miss Colbert's been tellin' me

47:55.499 --> 47:58.168
about a-a cover-up arrest?

48:00.003 --> 48:02.756
No, ma'am, we ain't had no cover-up.

48:02.839 --> 48:05.884
In fact, we just dropped the charges
for insufficient evidence.

48:07.678 --> 48:10.722
Miss Colbert,
I told you he was nobody's man.

48:11.515 --> 48:15.060
I came by to make it
as clear as I possibly can

48:15.143 --> 48:19.273
that I do not want that Negro officer
taken off this case.

48:21.692 --> 48:22.985
Negro officer?

48:25.487 --> 48:27.072
Yeah, well, he, uh ‒

48:28.031 --> 48:31.201
he comes from up North, you see,
and he was, uh, kinda...

48:35.622 --> 48:36.915
passin' through.

48:36.999 --> 48:38.125
I don't care what he is.

48:38.208 --> 48:40.127
If it wasn't for him,
your impartial chief of police

48:40.210 --> 48:43.005
would still have
the wrong man behind bars.

48:45.090 --> 48:48.176
I want that officer given a free hand.

48:48.260 --> 48:49.595
Otherwise...

48:50.012 --> 48:52.848
I will pack up my husband's engineers...

48:56.184 --> 48:58.061
and leave you...

49:00.105 --> 49:01.773
to yourselves.

49:09.156 --> 49:12.159
Now, Mrs. Colbert,
now, don't you worry about a thing.

49:12.242 --> 49:14.661
Believe me, we're gonna
take care of everything.

49:16.705 --> 49:17.914
Bill.

49:24.755 --> 49:27.299
I wanna see you come through this now.
You hear?

49:28.300 --> 49:30.677
Even if we have to
step on Endicott's toes?

49:31.928 --> 49:33.847
Even that.

49:33.930 --> 49:35.724
But do it fast.

49:37.351 --> 49:39.353
All right.

49:39.436 --> 49:42.397
Now, Bill, uh,
how 'bout this here Negro officer?

49:42.481 --> 49:44.983
Miss Colbert seems to have
a lot of confidence in him.

49:45.067 --> 49:47.361
Oh, he ain't nothin'.
He's some kind of a ‒

49:49.404 --> 49:51.156
some kind of a homicide expert.

49:51.239 --> 49:52.866
But I don't need him.

49:54.826 --> 49:56.787
You mean you don't want him.

49:56.870 --> 49:58.538
But you do need him.

49:59.831 --> 50:01.458
Now look, Bill.

50:01.541 --> 50:03.627
Suppose he turns up the killer.

50:03.710 --> 50:05.504
He has no police powers here.

50:05.587 --> 50:08.215
He's gonna have to hand him over
on a platter, right?

50:09.174 --> 50:11.176
That's right.

50:11.259 --> 50:14.179
And if he fails, you're off the hook,

50:14.262 --> 50:17.140
'cause it was Miss Colbert's idea
in the first place.

50:17.224 --> 50:18.725
See what I mean?

50:19.768 --> 50:21.353
Oh, yeah.

50:22.062 --> 50:25.273
Works out all the way around, Bill,
for all of us.

50:26.316 --> 50:27.526
Excuse me.

51:00.809 --> 51:03.311
Any reason why you have to leave today?

51:04.187 --> 51:06.106
There's lots of reasons.

51:07.607 --> 51:11.486
Uh, what would you say if I, uh ‒
I asked you to stay for a while?

51:11.570 --> 51:13.071
No.

51:25.917 --> 51:27.919
This town needs a factory, Virgil.

51:29.212 --> 51:31.757
Colbert come down from Chicago to build it.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.509
I hear they're gonna hire a thousand men.

51:34.593 --> 51:36.678
Half of 'em would be colored.

51:36.762 --> 51:39.139
You know what that means?

51:39.222 --> 51:41.933
- Probably got him killed.
- That's what Mrs. Colbert thinks.

51:42.017 --> 51:44.436
She wants us to catch her a killer.

51:44.519 --> 51:46.563
No killer, no factory.

51:47.481 --> 51:50.692
Well, that's a lot of jobs
for a lot of colored people.

51:50.776 --> 51:52.486
You follow me?

51:53.612 --> 51:55.197
I'm going home, man.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.783
- They're your people.
- Not mine! Yours!

51:57.866 --> 51:59.701
You made this scene.

51:59.785 --> 52:01.703
What do you want me to do? Beg you?
Is that what you're after?

52:01.787 --> 52:04.915
Look, I've had your town up to here!

52:04.998 --> 52:08.794
Boy, it would give me a world of satisfaction
to horsewhip you, Virgil!

52:13.673 --> 52:15.258
Yeah, well ‒

52:15.342 --> 52:17.636
my father used to say that.

52:20.972 --> 52:23.975
- Even did it once or twice.
- Yeah, well, not enough to suit me.

52:26.603 --> 52:28.063
Now, you listen to me.

52:29.231 --> 52:31.983
Just once in my life
I'm gonna hold my temper.

52:32.067 --> 52:34.236
I'm tellin' you that you're gonna stay here.

52:34.319 --> 52:36.822
You're gonna stay here if I have to go inside
and call your chief of police

52:36.905 --> 52:38.907
and have him remind you
of what he told you to do.

52:38.990 --> 52:41.243
But I don't think I have to do that, you see.

52:41.326 --> 52:45.872
No, because you're so damned smart ‒
you're smarter than any white man ‒

52:45.956 --> 52:48.708
you're just gonna stay here
and show us all.

52:48.792 --> 52:51.169
You've got such a big head
that you could never live with yourself

52:51.253 --> 52:53.839
unless you could put us all to shame.

52:55.006 --> 52:57.008
You wanna know something, Virgil?

52:58.552 --> 53:03.098
I don't think that you could let
an opportunity like that pass by.

53:43.722 --> 53:45.223
Jess.

53:46.016 --> 53:48.018
Jess, this is, uh ‒

53:48.101 --> 53:50.353
This is Virgil. He's workin' for me.

53:51.563 --> 53:53.857
Give him somethin' that runs.
You fix him up, you hear?

53:53.940 --> 53:56.151
What I fix, runs.

53:56.234 --> 53:57.444
Who pays?

53:57.527 --> 53:58.778
Police.

54:01.197 --> 54:03.867
Well, you know where to find me.

54:44.032 --> 54:46.242
What you doin' here, man?

54:46.326 --> 54:47.702
Policeman.

54:48.495 --> 54:50.789
You're a policeman here in Sparta?

54:52.666 --> 54:55.919
They've got a murder
they don't know what to do with.

54:56.002 --> 54:57.587
They need a whipping boy.

55:06.721 --> 55:08.348
You got a roof?

55:09.891 --> 55:11.434
No.

55:11.518 --> 55:13.186
I'll find a motel.

55:17.482 --> 55:19.025
Viola.

55:19.818 --> 55:21.403
We got company.

55:28.910 --> 55:31.579
You know what's gonna happen?

55:31.663 --> 55:33.873
He gonna get hisself killed.

55:35.333 --> 55:37.335
You watch and see he don't.

55:37.419 --> 55:41.256
I'm aware of the risk, Tom,
but like it or not, we're stuck with him.

55:41.339 --> 55:44.509
Not if the chief here's right on the ball.

55:45.385 --> 55:47.053
What do you say, Chief?

55:47.137 --> 55:51.433
You got that ol' killer
all lined up in your front sights, huh?

55:52.934 --> 55:54.644
I'm workin' on it.

55:55.353 --> 55:57.856
Tom, climb off of Gillespie's back now.

55:57.939 --> 56:00.984
You know damn well
we didn't hire him off a homicide squad.

56:02.861 --> 56:05.655
Yeah, well, it's gonna be his week,

56:05.739 --> 56:08.700
'cause Colbert's only the start.

56:08.783 --> 56:11.494
I say this nigger won't live past Saturday.

56:22.964 --> 56:27.302
Mrs. Colbert, can you tell me
about your husband's enemies?

56:27.385 --> 56:28.887
That's Endicott.

56:30.096 --> 56:32.515
He's been fighting us all the way.

56:32.599 --> 56:35.727
He sits up on his hill and runs this county.

56:35.810 --> 56:37.854
Or did, until we moved in.

56:42.442 --> 56:45.403
Did your husband tell you
where he was going last night?

56:47.697 --> 56:49.908
He said he wasn't sleepy.

56:50.867 --> 56:52.160
I went to bed.

56:52.243 --> 56:54.120
What time was that?

56:55.914 --> 56:58.416
A little after 11:00, I think.

56:59.751 --> 57:03.046
Did he call you,
or anybody on your staff, after 11:00?

57:03.880 --> 57:05.381
No.

57:07.300 --> 57:11.304
Maybe the elevator boy can tell us
what time he went out.

57:11.387 --> 57:13.890
They put it on self-service after 10:00.

57:18.645 --> 57:21.231
Did your husband use a car here?

58:39.225 --> 58:41.436
Find anything?

58:41.519 --> 58:43.563
Whoever killed Colbert
drove his car last night.

58:43.646 --> 58:45.648
Well, how do you know?

58:47.317 --> 58:49.319
Well, where are you goin'?

58:50.528 --> 58:52.322
I'd drive up there in the car you gave me,

58:52.405 --> 58:55.700
but I'm sure you don't want me running
up there by myself, causing more trouble.

58:55.783 --> 58:57.785
- Up where?
- Eric Endicott's.

58:57.869 --> 58:59.746
Endicott's? Oh, come on now!

59:49.003 --> 59:50.630
None of that for you, huh, Virgil?

Listen, you know somethin' I don't know?

01:01:01.743 --> 01:01:05.079
I found a piece of osmunda
in Colbert's car.

01:01:05.163 --> 01:01:07.123
- A piece of what?
- On the brake pedal.

01:01:07.206 --> 01:01:08.875
Osmunda. Fern root.

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:10.460
Fern root?

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.670
Oh, is Mr. Endicott here?

01:01:12.754 --> 01:01:16.549
Yes, sir. He's out in the greenhouse.
Would you follow me, please?

01:01:42.116 --> 01:01:44.410
- Gillespie.
- Mr. Endicott.

01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:47.705
This here's Virgil.

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:51.000
- Mr. Tibbs.
- How do you do, sir?

01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:55.171
Oh, uh ‒ May I have Henry fetch you somethin'?
Uh, some light refreshment?

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:57.173
No, thank you.
We're all right the way we are.

01:01:57.256 --> 01:02:00.676
Oh, I'll have something cold.
Something soft. Anything.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.596
Henry, bring in a pitcher of lemonade.
I'll have one too.

01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:05.181
Yes, sir.

01:02:07.183 --> 01:02:10.311
Oh, I didn't know it was possible
to grow this species locally.

01:02:10.395 --> 01:02:12.688
- Oh, you like flowers?
- I do.

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:15.066
Well, Mr. Tibbs,
do you know anything about orchids?

01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:16.984
Well, not very much, but I do like them.

01:02:17.068 --> 01:02:19.612
Well, let me show you.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.741
Endicott's folly.

01:02:27.703 --> 01:02:30.206
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:31.833
It's breathtaking.

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:33.709
Have you a favorite, Mr. Tibbs?

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:37.004
Well, I'm partial to any of the epiphytics.

01:02:37.088 --> 01:02:40.299
Why, isn't that remarkable

01:02:40.383 --> 01:02:44.220
that of all the orchids in this place,
you should prefer the epiphytics.

01:02:44.303 --> 01:02:47.098
I wonder if you know why.

01:02:47.181 --> 01:02:49.684
Maybe it would be helpful if you'd tell me.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:52.645
Because, like the Negro,

01:02:52.728 --> 01:02:56.649
they need care and feedin' and cultivatin'...

01:02:57.733 --> 01:02:59.652
and that takes time.

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:05.032
That's something you can't
make some people understand.

01:03:05.116 --> 01:03:07.493
That's somethin' Mr. Colbert didn't realize.

01:03:15.084 --> 01:03:17.753
Is this what the epiphytics root in?

01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:20.631
My point! They thrive on it.

01:03:20.715 --> 01:03:23.509
Take it away from them, they do poorly.

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:25.845
What do you call this material?

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:27.930
That's osmunda. Fern root.

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:39.192
Well, we don't wanna take any more
of your time, Mr. Endicott.

01:03:42.653 --> 01:03:44.989
Why'd you two come here?

01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:54.165
To ask you about Mr. Colbert.

01:03:58.461 --> 01:04:01.380
Let me understand this.

01:04:01.464 --> 01:04:05.301
You two came here to question me?

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:13.601
Well, your ‒ your attitudes, Mr. Endicott,

01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:15.311
your points of view

01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:17.188
are a matter of record.

01:04:18.439 --> 01:04:19.690
Some people ‒

01:04:19.774 --> 01:04:22.318
Well, let us say the people
who work for Mr. Colbert

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:26.405
might reasonably regard you as the person
least likely to mourn his passing.

01:04:28.241 --> 01:04:31.536
We were just trying to clarify
some of the evidence.

01:04:33.079 --> 01:04:35.414
Was Mr. Colbert ever in this greenhouse,

01:04:35.498 --> 01:04:38.000
say, last night about midnight?

01:04:44.298 --> 01:04:45.800
Gillespie.

01:04:46.384 --> 01:04:48.261
Yeah?

01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:49.971
You saw it?

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:52.223
Oh, I saw it.

01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:54.850
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

01:04:58.604 --> 01:04:59.939
I don't know.

01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:03.568
I'll remember that.

01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:12.410
There was a time
when I could have had you shot!

01:05:43.566 --> 01:05:45.484
You better damn well clear out,
and I mean fast!

01:05:45.568 --> 01:05:47.653
What about that big speech
you gave me this morning?

01:05:47.737 --> 01:05:50.573
I didn't know you were gonna slap
any white man, least of all Endicott!

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:54.243
All right. Give me another day.
Two days. I'm close.

01:05:54.327 --> 01:05:56.495
I can pull that fat cat down.

01:05:56.579 --> 01:05:59.498
I can bring him right off this hill.

01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:02.585
Oh, boy.

01:06:05.087 --> 01:06:10.217
Man, you're just like the rest of us, ain't ya?

01:06:25.483 --> 01:06:26.984
It's all my fault.

01:06:32.323 --> 01:06:34.617
Well, there's no point in duckin' it, Bill.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.286
It's gonna be tough
to keep you in your job now.

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:40.831
Now lookee here, Bill.

01:06:40.915 --> 01:06:43.918
I don't have to tell you how urgent it is
to get Tibbs outta town.

01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:47.088
- I already told him to go.
- All right.

01:06:47.171 --> 01:06:50.424
Now, Mrs. Colbert
is not gonna be back till Thursday.

01:06:50.508 --> 01:06:53.886
You catch your guilty party by then,
she's not gonna hold it against us

01:06:53.969 --> 01:06:56.347
we had to send Tibbs home
for his own good.

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:59.100
But you gotta do it, you hear?

01:06:59.183 --> 01:07:00.685
I hear.

01:07:02.812 --> 01:07:04.438
Bill?

01:07:07.775 --> 01:07:10.361
What's made you change your mind
about Tibbs?

01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:12.363
Who says I have?

01:07:13.406 --> 01:07:19.245
The last chief we had, he'd have shot Tibbs
one second after he slapped Endicott.

01:07:19.328 --> 01:07:21.414
Claimed self-defense.

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:40.766
- Gillespie here.
<i>- Courtney here, sir.</i>

01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:43.060
All right, look,
did you take Virgil down the depot?

01:07:43.144 --> 01:07:45.312
<i>No, sir. He just plain wouldn't go.</i>

01:07:45.396 --> 01:07:47.440
<i>Shagbag just saw him heading up
toward River Road.</i>

01:07:47.523 --> 01:07:49.024
Check.

01:08:12.381 --> 01:08:15.760
- Nail him! Come on. Come on.
- One more time.

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:18.429
Come on!

01:08:41.827 --> 01:08:44.830
Stay with him. Come on. Come on.
Stay with him.

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:43.574
Okay, black boy.
We come here to teach you some manners.

01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:48.537
Now, we told you
'bout them bad manners, boy.

01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:50.706
You better put that down.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.631
Why don't you come and get it, baby?

01:11:19.068 --> 01:11:21.195
Come on, man. You ain't nothin'. Come on.

01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:24.198
Let's get him.

01:11:26.784 --> 01:11:28.702
Put that round your neck.

01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:30.955
Get him there! Get him!

01:11:31.956 --> 01:11:33.415
Get him!

01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:37.211
Hit him, baby. Go on. The other side.

01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:54.770
Look out, man. Get back. Watch out.

01:11:54.853 --> 01:11:56.313
All right, hold it!

01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:04.989
All right, boys.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:11.996
You've had your fun.
Now, go on. You just run along home.

01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:16.750
Nigger lover.

01:12:27.219 --> 01:12:30.014
I didn't catch what you said.

01:12:30.097 --> 01:12:32.016
Get rid of the nigger.

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:35.185
If you don't... we will.

01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:40.024
Now, is that a suggestion
or is that an order?

01:12:40.107 --> 01:12:42.109
That's a warning!

01:12:45.487 --> 01:12:46.989
I see.

01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:49.700
I see.

01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:56.915
Get your trash and get outta here!

01:12:56.999 --> 01:12:58.625
Come on, move it and go!

01:13:07.551 --> 01:13:10.387
Well, you finally get the message, Virgil?

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:25.319
May I get in?

01:13:26.445 --> 01:13:29.156
- Thought you left town.
- Not yet.

01:13:34.161 --> 01:13:36.580
Could you follow the same route
you followed Tuesday night?

01:13:36.663 --> 01:13:38.165
Same speed.

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:40.751
- Why?
- Why not?

01:13:44.379 --> 01:13:46.673
- Maybe I'd better check with the chief.
- Maybe you'd better.

01:13:46.757 --> 01:13:50.385
I wouldn't want him to slap you down
for steppin' out of line,

01:13:51.303 --> 01:13:53.931
makin' decisions on your own and all that.

01:13:55.933 --> 01:13:58.852
He don't knock me outta my socks.

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:03.023
Let's get rollin', Virgil.

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:25.129
<i>All you little birds better lock up tight</i>

01:14:25.212 --> 01:14:28.632
<i>'cause there's a foul owl

Take ten minutes to get myself
a king-sized Coke and a wedge of pie.

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:23.103
That is if that peckerwood
ain't sold out again.

01:15:25.856 --> 01:15:28.192
Can I bring you anything?

01:15:28.275 --> 01:15:29.985
No, I'm coming in.

01:15:41.121 --> 01:15:43.290
I thought I told you
to get the hell outta here.

01:15:43.373 --> 01:15:44.708
I'm not ready to leave.

01:15:44.791 --> 01:15:46.793
I was gonna tell you
all about that in the mornin', Chief.

01:15:46.877 --> 01:15:48.712
Later! You forget about
those four maniacs this afternoon?

01:15:48.795 --> 01:15:49.963
- I need more time!
- Time!

01:15:50.047 --> 01:15:52.424
- Do I have to put you on the train myself?
- I guess so!

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:54.009
Oh.

01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:59.723
All right, Virgil.
Just what the hell do you want?

01:16:00.724 --> 01:16:05.187
I want to know exactly where Sam Wood was

01:16:19.743 --> 01:16:21.078

Got some real luscious cream pie
for you tonight, Sam.

01:16:44.059 --> 01:16:47.104
I mean, Officer Wood.
Just like you always order.

01:16:47.187 --> 01:16:49.273
Now, you know I don't eat that stuff.

01:16:49.356 --> 01:16:52.025
The chief here likes his boys streamlined.
Ain't that right, Chief?

01:16:52.109 --> 01:16:54.111
Why don't you shut up, Sam.

01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:58.115
- All right, what'll you have, Virgil?
- I ain't servin' him!

01:17:07.833 --> 01:17:12.087
Tuesday night you walked out
of here at 2:40, right?

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:14.047
Right on the button.

01:17:15.132 --> 01:17:16.967
Two minutes from now.

01:17:32.858 --> 01:17:34.151
That's for him.

01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:52.711
Now, what'd you do
when you came out that night?

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:56.631
Well, I, uh ‒
I picked up the radio and called in.

01:17:56.715 --> 01:17:58.383
Do it, please.

01:17:58.467 --> 01:18:00.052
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:18:08.935 --> 01:18:13.774
Uh, Wood to radio.
I'm leavin' Compton's now.

01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:16.902
<i>Hey, Sam, you better look sharp.
Gillespie's sniffin' around.</i>

01:18:16.985 --> 01:18:18.695
Give me that thing!

01:18:19.988 --> 01:18:23.116
Courtney, I checked with your brother.
He told me I didn't tell him to fix that hinge.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.952
That means I told you.
Do you read me, Courtney?

01:18:26.036 --> 01:18:29.164
<i>- Oh, I'll get right on it, Chief.</i>
- Oh, I'd do that if I were you.

01:18:29.247 --> 01:18:30.957
<i>Yes, sir. Ten-four.</i>

01:18:50.685 --> 01:18:54.314
All right, you can move us, <i>Officer Wood.</i>

01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:40.735
- Why'd you do that, Sam?
- Do what?

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:44.156
Change your route back there at the corner.

01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:47.993
Who says I changed?

01:19:51.788 --> 01:19:54.082
Look, I oughta know what I did!

01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:58.170
Chief, do I have to put up with this?
Do I work for you, or do I work for him?

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.176
Good night, gentlemen.

01:20:33.413 --> 01:20:37.042
I don't know. I don't know.

01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:40.212
Well, I appreciate anything you can do.

01:20:40.295 --> 01:20:43.381
- You know, this is highly irregular.
- Yeah, I know that.

01:20:44.132 --> 01:20:46.760
Showing our depositors' accounts.

01:20:46.843 --> 01:20:49.554
Mm-mm. I don't know.

01:20:51.932 --> 01:20:53.767
You sure this is an official request?

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.477
Yes, it's official. Yes.

01:20:59.356 --> 01:21:00.982
You willing to put that in writing?

01:21:01.066 --> 01:21:03.276
Yeah, yeah, I'll put it in writing,
anyplace you'd like it.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.612
On a police department letterhead?

01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:08.823
I will write it on the head of a pin,
if you want it there.

01:21:08.907 --> 01:21:10.784
I gotta have somethin' for the file, you know.

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:13.411
I realize that, but I'm in a hurry,
Mr. Henderson.

01:21:13.495 --> 01:21:16.373
Well, we'll see.

01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:22.295
Well, he's had an account with us
for several years now.

01:21:22.379 --> 01:21:23.964
Is that so?

01:21:24.047 --> 01:21:25.465
Mmm.

01:21:25.549 --> 01:21:27.842
Not a large account.

01:21:29.177 --> 01:21:34.516
Never more than, well, um...

01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:38.353
$208.

01:21:38.436 --> 01:21:41.147
That was back in '62.

01:21:41.231 --> 01:21:42.732
September.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.862
I am not interested in '62, September.
I am interested in yesterday.

01:21:47.946 --> 01:21:49.698
Yesterday?

01:21:49.781 --> 01:21:51.283
Well ‒

01:21:52.993 --> 01:21:56.371
Well, according to this,

01:21:56.454 --> 01:22:00.667
he made a deposit of... $632.

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:02.586
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.

01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:04.212
Well, thank you.

01:22:04.296 --> 01:22:07.048
That must've been when I was out to lunch.

01:22:07.132 --> 01:22:09.676
A deposit that size I'd remember.

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:13.388
Oh, you'll send me that letter
for the file, you hear?

01:22:13.471 --> 01:22:17.392
I'll tell you something, baby brother.
The chief didn't like him, not even from the first.

01:22:17.475 --> 01:22:19.102
Mmm.

01:22:20.103 --> 01:22:22.564
- Morning.
- Hey. Where do you think you're going?

01:22:22.647 --> 01:22:25.108
It's all right. Let him go.

01:22:30.155 --> 01:22:32.157
I've just gotten off the phone with the FBI lab.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.869
We can prove that Colbert was there
in that greenhouse. Endicott's covering up.

01:22:35.952 --> 01:22:38.580
I'm afraid you're a little late, Virgil.

01:22:38.663 --> 01:22:41.458
- We already got the guilty man.
- Who?

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:42.792
Sam.

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.712
- Sam?
- That's right.

01:22:50.383 --> 01:22:51.968
Our man is Endicott.

01:22:52.594 --> 01:22:55.722
You just think a minute.
Didn't you catch Sam in a lie last night?

01:22:55.805 --> 01:22:59.100
And yesterday he goes ahead
and makes a big cash deposit at the bank.

01:22:59.184 --> 01:23:01.728
If I told you once,
I told you a hundred times

01:23:01.853 --> 01:23:05.398
that I won that money matchin' quarters and halves,
and it took me three years to do it!

01:23:05.482 --> 01:23:07.692
Then why was it in big bills?
'Cause I checked at the bank.

01:23:07.776 --> 01:23:11.696
Because whenever I got enough change,
I'd trade it in on $20 bills.

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:14.032
And when I got up to $600,
I took it down and put it in the bank.

01:23:14.115 --> 01:23:15.116
It's simple as that.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.453
Well, all I know is that the day Colbert
was killed, he cashed a check for $900,

01:23:18.536 --> 01:23:20.205
$600 of which is missing,

01:23:20.288 --> 01:23:23.166
$300 which I believe you left in the wallet
as sucker bait for some poor kid,

01:23:23.249 --> 01:23:24.334
like that Harvey Oberst.

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:25.877
What kind of man do you think I am?

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.545
Now, don't you push me, boy!

01:23:33.635 --> 01:23:36.012
Now listen,

01:23:36.096 --> 01:23:38.848
if you weren't suspicious of Sam here,

01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:42.435
why did you question him last night
when he changed his route?

01:23:45.522 --> 01:23:48.400
- I already knew why he changed his route.
- Knew what?

01:23:48.483 --> 01:23:51.778
He was afraid I'd see
some naked white girl down the block.

01:23:52.445 --> 01:23:54.989
- What you talkin' about, naked white girls?
- Some girl named Delores Purdy.

01:23:55.073 --> 01:23:57.742
She parades around in the nude
at night to get her kicks.

01:23:57.826 --> 01:23:59.327
That's ‒

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:02.288
- And how do you know?
- I know, I know.

01:24:02.372 --> 01:24:04.874
Well, I know, you understand?

01:24:04.958 --> 01:24:08.128
I know that Colbert
cashed a check for $900.

01:24:08.211 --> 01:24:10.922
I know that Sam made a big cash deposit.

01:24:11.005 --> 01:24:13.049
I know that you caught him in a lie.

01:24:13.133 --> 01:24:15.552
And I know that's enough for me.

01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:18.638
Come on, Sam.

01:24:18.722 --> 01:24:20.640
Martin, lock him up.

01:24:24.644 --> 01:24:26.146
Well?

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:33.903
Well... you're making a mistake.

01:24:34.779 --> 01:24:36.865
Don't you bet against it.

01:24:39.993 --> 01:24:41.995
You can catch your train now, Virgil.

01:25:05.435 --> 01:25:06.936
Tibbs?

01:25:10.023 --> 01:25:12.025
Do you think Sam did it?

01:25:15.904 --> 01:25:17.822
Where do I find the chief?

01:25:17.906 --> 01:25:20.825
- What's this all about?
- My business.

01:25:20.909 --> 01:25:22.619
Hey ‒

01:25:22.702 --> 01:25:24.871
Hey, look, Purdy.

01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:27.916
Now, you got a complaint?
Well, right here's where you file it.

01:25:30.585 --> 01:25:33.213
What I got to say I say to the chief.

01:25:34.214 --> 01:25:35.715
It's about Sam Wood.

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:38.927
All right.

01:25:41.846 --> 01:25:43.765
Yeah?

01:25:47.393 --> 01:25:50.021
Purdy's out here, sir. It's about Sam.

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.982
All right. Send him in.

01:26:04.702 --> 01:26:07.288
She is gonna have a baby.
Sam Wood's baby.

01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:16.089
Well, ask her yourself
if you don't believe me.

01:26:16.756 --> 01:26:18.716
What are you doin' here?

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.262
It's important that I hear this.

01:26:27.517 --> 01:26:30.687
Well, I ain't talkin' 'bout this
with him in the room.

01:26:34.065 --> 01:26:36.109
Boy, you don't want a slough of trouble,
you get.

01:26:36.192 --> 01:26:38.945
You be sensible. I'm a police officer.

01:26:41.948 --> 01:26:44.200
You gonna get him outta here,
or do I gotta do it?

01:26:44.784 --> 01:26:47.996
You ain't gonna do nothin'.

01:26:48.079 --> 01:26:49.914
You just stand there and shut up.

01:26:59.173 --> 01:27:00.800
Sit down, little girl.

01:27:04.762 --> 01:27:06.139
All right now.

01:27:08.057 --> 01:27:12.812
You tell me all about it.
You just tell me how it happened.

01:27:16.441 --> 01:27:18.443
Oh, come on, come on, girl, speak!

01:27:18.526 --> 01:27:20.778
Well, you know how hot it's been.

01:27:20.862 --> 01:27:21.946
Yeah.

01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:24.032
Nights, they aren't any better.

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:28.578
My brother works nights.

01:27:29.412 --> 01:27:31.039
He leaves me all alone.

01:27:32.373 --> 01:27:35.335
This particular night,
I go out on the porch.

01:27:36.544 --> 01:27:39.923
I'm thinkin' how nice it'd be
if I had a fountain drink.

01:27:42.342 --> 01:27:45.345
Sam comes down our road,

01:27:45.428 --> 01:27:48.097
just like he comes every night.

01:27:49.057 --> 01:27:53.269
Passin' like a lord
in that fine, big, shiny car.

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:58.566
Only this time he stops.

01:28:00.818 --> 01:28:03.154
He's got a nice face,
don't you think, Chief?

01:28:04.447 --> 01:28:06.324
So he stopped.

01:28:10.536 --> 01:28:12.956
- And he says ‒
- What? I didn't hear what you said.

01:28:13.831 --> 01:28:16.793
He says,

01:28:16.876 --> 01:28:18.962
"Hey, little girl.

01:28:20.713 --> 01:28:23.466
You know what the coolest spot in town is?"

01:28:24.759 --> 01:28:30.348
And I said, "No, Sam, I guess I don't."

01:28:30.431 --> 01:28:34.560
And he said, "A cemetery, that's where.

01:28:35.812 --> 01:28:37.939
Know why?

01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:45.029
'Cause they got
all them big, cool tombstones.

01:28:45.113 --> 01:28:49.075
Ever stretch out on a tombstone, Delores?

01:28:49.158 --> 01:28:53.788
Feel all that nice, cool marble
along your body?"

01:28:59.252 --> 01:29:01.170
He said that?

01:29:01.254 --> 01:29:02.797
You hear, Chief? You hear?

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.341
Yeah, I hear, I hear.

01:29:05.425 --> 01:29:07.927
All right now, Sam comes along
and stops in front of your house.

01:29:08.011 --> 01:29:10.013
He starts to talk to you. What else?

01:29:10.847 --> 01:29:13.016
Well, come on now, girl.
What else, what else, what else?

01:29:15.935 --> 01:29:17.603
Then I went for a ride with him.

01:29:17.687 --> 01:29:20.231
- Where'd you go?
- To the cemetery.

01:29:20.314 --> 01:29:23.693
So Wood took you to the cemetery
in the patrol car, right?

01:29:24.777 --> 01:29:27.238
And then things went a little bit too far.
Is that what you're saying?

01:29:28.573 --> 01:29:30.742
Did they get a little bit outta line?

01:29:30.825 --> 01:29:33.870
Well, come on now.
Is that what you're tryin' to say?

01:29:33.953 --> 01:29:36.039
Come on, girl! Is it or ain't it? Come on!

01:29:36.122 --> 01:29:38.833
- Yeah, they went too far!
- Well, fine!

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.420
Now, I got one more question ‒
very important.

01:29:43.004 --> 01:29:45.381
Did he force you, or did you let him?

01:29:45.465 --> 01:29:47.592
Don't mean a damn
whether she let him or not!

01:29:47.675 --> 01:29:50.595
She is still 16! In this state, that's rape.

01:29:50.678 --> 01:29:52.638
I checked on that.
I know the plain law on that!

01:29:52.722 --> 01:29:55.892
I know the laws
in the state of Mississippi, thank you!

01:29:59.228 --> 01:30:02.398
- Are you sure you're pregnant?
- Yes, I am pregnant!

01:30:06.986 --> 01:30:08.738
- Courtney.
- Yes, sir?

01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:11.074
Better get in here with a pad and a pencil.

01:30:17.205 --> 01:30:19.373
Come on in.
I want you to take this all down.

01:30:19.457 --> 01:30:23.044
You had no right
to keep a nigger in the room.

01:30:23.127 --> 01:30:25.254
Shame my little sister.

01:30:26.172 --> 01:30:28.716
You had no right.

01:30:30.635 --> 01:30:32.637
Uh, Virge, what's happenin'?

01:30:33.262 --> 01:30:34.764
- Hi, Harv.
- How are you, Virgil?

01:30:34.847 --> 01:30:35.890
All right.

01:30:35.973 --> 01:30:39.936
Man, uh, uh ‒

01:30:40.019 --> 01:30:41.521
You sure saved my hide.

01:30:41.604 --> 01:30:43.439
Listen, Harvey.

01:30:43.523 --> 01:30:45.024
Man, uh...

01:30:46.943 --> 01:30:50.696
if a guy knocks up a girl in this town,
where can he go for help?

01:30:53.032 --> 01:30:55.368
Uh, barbershop.

01:30:55.451 --> 01:30:57.120
Barbershop?

01:30:57.203 --> 01:30:59.789
Borrow Mr. Fanning's razor
and cut your throat.

01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:03.543
Well ‒

01:31:04.961 --> 01:31:07.797
But suppose
Mr. Fanning's razor is too dull.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.508
Suppose he's got some real money
to spread around.

01:31:15.555 --> 01:31:17.056
Uh ‒

01:31:17.849 --> 01:31:19.350
Well, uh...

01:31:20.852 --> 01:31:22.770
there used to be a colored gal...

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.024
but, uh, she kept bumping her price,

01:31:27.108 --> 01:31:29.652
and I don't know if she's still in business.

01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:31.571
What's her name?

01:31:31.654 --> 01:31:34.448
Well, I ain't never had to look her up,

01:31:34.532 --> 01:31:37.994
but, uh, Packy might know.

01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:40.872
Where do I find Packy?

01:31:42.081 --> 01:31:44.167
Down at the pool hall.

01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:46.210
But, man, he wouldn't tell you,

01:31:46.961 --> 01:31:49.255
not unless I say so.

01:31:49.338 --> 01:31:52.550
And, uh, how am I gonna say so
locked up in here?

01:31:52.633 --> 01:31:54.927
Suppose I get word to Packy
that you wanna see him,

01:31:55.011 --> 01:31:56.345
have him come here?

01:32:00.683 --> 01:32:03.269
You'd let him bring me a cheeseburger?

01:32:06.898 --> 01:32:07.899
Onions?

01:32:09.150 --> 01:32:10.651
Now you're talkin'.

01:32:12.445 --> 01:32:14.530
Uh, uh, Virge?

01:33:07.667 --> 01:33:09.585
Gettin' a little careless, ain't ya, Virgil?

01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:12.672
Leaving your car parked in the road like that.
Gonna get yourself killed.

01:33:12.755 --> 01:33:14.757
Anybody'd know where you are.

01:33:16.801 --> 01:33:18.886
- You know what this land is?
- Yeah, I know what it is.

01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:20.888
It's the site for the new factory.

01:33:22.473 --> 01:33:24.475
I found a piece of wood
in Colbert's scalp.

01:33:24.558 --> 01:33:26.560
The lab identified it as pine.

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.481
Three people saw Colbert
drive by their houses, alone,

01:33:30.564 --> 01:33:32.692
on the way back from Endicott's.

01:33:32.775 --> 01:33:37.363
Colbert must have picked up somebody
in town and then... come out here.

01:33:37.446 --> 01:33:40.491
Boy, you got it all figured out, ain't you, Virgil?
I tell you, he didn't pick up nobody.

01:33:40.574 --> 01:33:42.743
I tell you that Sam
followed him out here in the patrol car.

01:33:42.827 --> 01:33:44.829
Sam come up behind him,
just like I come up behind you.

01:33:44.912 --> 01:33:46.831
I heard you coming.
Colbert would have heard too.

01:33:46.914 --> 01:33:48.666
Yeah, he heard!
He turned and he got smashed!

01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:50.042
He was hit from behind.

01:33:50.710 --> 01:33:53.796
If Delores Purdy hadn't come into your office,
I never would have seen the truth.

01:33:53.879 --> 01:33:57.758
I was hung up trying to get Endicott
for personal reasons.

01:33:57.842 --> 01:34:00.386
Do you know what I'm gonna do, Virgil?

01:34:00.469 --> 01:34:03.931
I'm gonna take you over to Brownsville
and put you on the bus myself!

01:34:04.015 --> 01:34:06.392
You aren't taking me anywhere, you dig?

01:34:06.475 --> 01:34:07.768
You're holding the wrong man!

01:34:07.852 --> 01:34:09.478
What do you mean
I'm holding the wrong man?

01:34:09.562 --> 01:34:12.732
I got the motive, which is money,
and the body, which is dead!

01:34:12.815 --> 01:34:15.151
- What makes you so sure?
- Why do you doubt it?

01:34:15.234 --> 01:34:17.695
Because Colbert was killed here,

01:34:17.778 --> 01:34:21.032
then driven back to town in his own car
and dumped on the streets.

01:34:21.115 --> 01:34:23.951
Sam couldn't have driven two cars.

01:34:53.731 --> 01:34:55.566
What do you want?

01:34:58.486 --> 01:35:00.488
Give me till morning.

01:35:43.447 --> 01:35:45.699
You know ‒

01:35:45.783 --> 01:35:49.286
You know, Virgil,
you are among the chosen few.

01:35:52.123 --> 01:35:54.291
How's that?

01:35:54.375 --> 01:35:58.587
Well, I think that you're the first human being
that's ever been in here.

01:36:03.342 --> 01:36:06.679
Well, you can't be too careful, man.

01:36:10.641 --> 01:36:12.852
You know a lot of things, don't ya?

01:36:14.437 --> 01:36:17.440
Well, just what do you know about insomnia?

01:36:22.778 --> 01:36:24.655
Bourbon can't cure it.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.745
Well, that's for sure.

01:36:32.872 --> 01:36:34.623
Now, look.

01:36:34.707 --> 01:36:37.501
I got no wife, I got no kids.

01:36:37.585 --> 01:36:42.756
Boy, I got a town that don't want me.

01:36:47.428 --> 01:36:51.891
Oh, and I got an air-conditioner
that I have to oil myself

01:36:51.974 --> 01:36:53.476
and a desk with a busted leg.

01:36:53.559 --> 01:36:56.896
And on top of that, I got ‒

01:36:56.979 --> 01:37:00.900
this, uh... place.

01:37:02.318 --> 01:37:06.113
Now, don't you think that'd drive a man
to take a few drinks?

01:37:13.871 --> 01:37:15.706
I'll tell you a secret.

01:37:16.832 --> 01:37:18.667
Nobody comes here.

01:37:20.711 --> 01:37:22.213
Never.

01:37:33.098 --> 01:37:34.600
You married?

01:37:36.477 --> 01:37:37.978
No.

01:37:39.772 --> 01:37:41.273
Ever been?

01:37:43.984 --> 01:37:45.486
No.

01:37:49.949 --> 01:37:52.034
Ever been close to it?

01:38:05.506 --> 01:38:07.132
Close to it.

01:38:12.638 --> 01:38:17.810
Don't you get just... a little lonely?

01:38:23.774 --> 01:38:25.693
No lonelier than you, man.

01:38:31.949 --> 01:38:35.286
Oh, now, don't get smart, black boy.

01:38:37.913 --> 01:38:39.915
I don't need it.

01:38:46.046 --> 01:38:47.548
No pity, thank you.

01:38:53.137 --> 01:38:54.763
No, thank you.

01:39:03.564 --> 01:39:04.815
- Yeah?
- Chief?

01:39:04.898 --> 01:39:07.526
- Yeah?
- You know where I can find Virgil?

01:39:08.902 --> 01:39:10.821
Who are you?

01:39:10.904 --> 01:39:13.490
Packy, Chief. Packy Harrison.

01:39:14.033 --> 01:39:16.076
I'm a friend of Harv's.

01:39:18.454 --> 01:39:20.456
You got something for me?

01:39:20.539 --> 01:39:21.832
Yeah.

01:39:21.915 --> 01:39:23.500
Where you goin'?

01:39:23.584 --> 01:39:25.169
Where whitey ain't allowed.

01:39:25.252 --> 01:39:27.504
What the hell does that mean?

01:39:27.588 --> 01:39:29.590
You gave me till morning, remember?

01:40:03.332 --> 01:40:06.460
- He's gone.
- Hell, he could have exchanged cars by now.

01:40:06.543 --> 01:40:09.588
- Let's dog him.
- Now you stick here. We'll keep cruisin'.

01:40:20.432 --> 01:40:22.935
You find him,
you come back for me, you hear?

01:40:26.939 --> 01:40:28.857
That's her place here.

01:40:29.441 --> 01:40:31.193
You want me to wait?

01:40:31.276 --> 01:40:33.696
No, thank you, Packy.

01:40:33.779 --> 01:40:35.531
You go on home.

01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:20.576
Mrs. Bellamy?

01:41:20.659 --> 01:41:23.579
People around here call me Mama Caleba.

01:41:23.662 --> 01:41:26.165
Mama, I'm not from around here.

01:41:26.248 --> 01:41:28.292
But you can put me on my train.

01:41:28.375 --> 01:41:30.919
You talk crazy.

01:41:31.003 --> 01:41:32.504
You gin drunk?

01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:35.299
Just homesick.

01:41:36.925 --> 01:41:39.136
Lord, Lord!

01:41:39.219 --> 01:41:42.639
Whisper two little words, Mama,
and I'm on my way.

01:41:42.848 --> 01:41:49.104
Maybe... I don't want to sever
a beautiful chile like you right out.

01:41:56.111 --> 01:41:57.738
A man's name.

01:42:02.242 --> 01:42:04.161
First name, last name.

01:42:05.913 --> 01:42:08.957
The man who's payin' you
for Delores Purdy's abortion.

01:42:09.041 --> 01:42:11.835
You're the boy who works for Mr. Charlie.

01:42:13.754 --> 01:42:15.923
I thought that's who you was.

01:42:17.216 --> 01:42:18.675
Why you wanna do that?

01:42:21.053 --> 01:42:23.514
Why you wanna help the police like that?

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.642
They stealin' your soul.

01:42:27.559 --> 01:42:29.937
They chew you up and spit you out.

01:42:30.896 --> 01:42:33.649
I'm not here to lay a finger on you, Mama.

01:42:35.567 --> 01:42:37.736
It's the white boy I want.

01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:40.322
What you got against him?
He's paying for his fun.

01:42:40.405 --> 01:42:41.865
How much?

01:42:41.949 --> 01:42:43.951
I'll bet you he's not paying you more
than a hundred.

01:42:44.034 --> 01:42:46.036
You know how much he's got
in his pocket right now?

01:42:46.119 --> 01:42:47.663
More than $600.

01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:52.793
That cracker?

01:42:52.876 --> 01:42:54.962
Where'd he come off getting 600?

01:42:55.045 --> 01:42:57.714
He killed Mr. Colbert.

01:42:57.798 --> 01:43:00.050
Oh ‒

01:43:00.133 --> 01:43:02.177
You gone crazy out of your mind.

01:43:02.261 --> 01:43:05.347
Now, listen and hear me good,
Mama, please.

01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:08.016
Don't make me have to send you to jail.

01:43:08.976 --> 01:43:10.477
Lot you care.

01:43:10.561 --> 01:43:12.896
There's white time in jail
and there's colored time in jail.

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:16.400
The worst kind of time you can do
is colored time.

01:43:19.695 --> 01:43:21.905
Chile,

01:43:21.989 --> 01:43:24.741
you promise ‒

01:43:24.825 --> 01:43:26.702
Give me understandin'.

01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:30.539
I got used to better.

01:43:31.623 --> 01:43:33.542
You won't take it away?

01:43:36.837 --> 01:43:39.172
I won't take it away.

01:43:41.258 --> 01:43:45.888
Well, I don't know his name,

01:43:45.971 --> 01:43:49.600
but she's comin' here tonight,

01:43:49.683 --> 01:43:51.310
get herself straight.

01:44:07.242 --> 01:44:09.411
Let go! Let me go!

01:44:09.494 --> 01:44:11.955
- Let go of her!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

01:44:12.039 --> 01:44:14.583
- Let go of her!
- Let go! Let go of me!

01:44:18.170 --> 01:44:19.671
I'm gonna teach you, boy.

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:23.508
No club this time, man?

01:44:24.092 --> 01:44:25.802
Gun's not smart.

01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:28.513
The way you killed Colbert
was much smarter.

01:44:29.514 --> 01:44:31.558
You killed Colbert.

01:44:31.642 --> 01:44:33.310
He's crazy.

01:44:33.393 --> 01:44:35.228
Crazy.

01:44:46.865 --> 01:44:49.201
Look at him!

01:44:49.284 --> 01:44:50.702
You had me clear.

01:44:50.786 --> 01:44:52.579
Come on! Get him!

01:44:52.663 --> 01:44:54.247
Come on. Come on.

01:44:54.331 --> 01:44:56.124
- Kill him!
- Get him up there.

01:44:56.208 --> 01:44:58.043
- You got it.
- Okay, nigger.

01:44:58.126 --> 01:45:00.462
Your time, nigger.

01:45:00.545 --> 01:45:01.922
Look in her purse.

01:45:03.674 --> 01:45:06.760
- What's that mean?
- She's got $100 to pay for an abortion.

01:45:07.302 --> 01:45:09.346
Listen to that ‒ that fancy ‒

01:45:09.429 --> 01:45:11.848
Money she got from Ralph.

01:45:12.599 --> 01:45:14.309
You gonna listen to him?

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:17.646
He got her to tell you
that Sam Wood did it.

01:45:18.730 --> 01:45:20.273
He made a fool outta you, Purdy.

01:45:22.442 --> 01:45:24.444
- Delores.
- Liar!

01:45:25.612 --> 01:45:28.699
You stinkin' liar!

01:45:28.782 --> 01:45:30.993
- My purse!
- Let go of her!

01:45:44.965 --> 01:45:49.970
You turned my little sister...
into a field slut.

01:45:51.888 --> 01:45:54.433
Lloyd!

01:45:54.516 --> 01:45:57.144
- Lloyd!
- Hey, man. Step back. He's got a gun.

01:46:00.731 --> 01:46:02.232
He's dead.

01:46:06.611 --> 01:46:08.822
Oh, Lloyd. Oh, Lloyd.

01:46:11.992 --> 01:46:13.827
I'm sorry.

01:46:14.953 --> 01:46:17.372
That night when I left her house,
I was going to the diner,

01:46:17.456 --> 01:46:20.459
and Mr. Colbert drove by,
so I hitched a ride with him, that's all.

01:46:20.542 --> 01:46:24.463
I said, "I sure would like a job
in that new factory once you get started."

01:46:24.546 --> 01:46:26.506
And he said, "Sure."

01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:28.925
And I said, well,
I wondered where it was gonna be.

01:46:29.009 --> 01:46:31.762
He said, well, that field
we were coming to right up ahead was it.

01:46:31.845 --> 01:46:34.431
He was gonna stop and show me.

01:46:34.514 --> 01:46:37.017
I said to myself, man, he's askin' for it.

01:46:38.185 --> 01:46:42.981
I said, now, Ralph,
all you gotta do when we get out

01:46:43.065 --> 01:46:45.358
is just sneak up behind him

01:46:45.442 --> 01:46:47.652
and just tap him.

01:46:48.653 --> 01:46:51.615
And then just claim that somebody
jumped us from the bushes.

01:46:57.829 --> 01:46:59.331
That's all.

01:47:00.999 --> 01:47:03.001
I didn't mean to kill him.

01:47:09.007 --> 01:47:10.842
Yeah.

01:47:10.926 --> 01:47:12.928
All right, Courtney, that's enough.

01:47:24.397 --> 01:47:26.191
All right, come on now.

01:47:40.497 --> 01:47:42.874
<i>That's all.</i>

01:47:43.875 --> 01:47:45.877
<i>I didn't mean to kill him.</i>

01:48:29.921 --> 01:48:32.507
Well, got your ticket?

01:48:33.341 --> 01:48:34.843
Here you are.

01:48:36.636 --> 01:48:38.138
Thank you.

01:48:40.098 --> 01:48:42.142
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:48:47.772 --> 01:48:49.316
Virgil.

01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:57.365
You take care, you hear?

01:49:02.162 --> 01:49:03.747
Yeah.
