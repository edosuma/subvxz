another driver, and then another...

-(RIBS CRACKING)

34:57.360 --> 34:59.249
(PANTING)

35:34.720 --> 35:35.846
MK is...

35:36.520 --> 35:37.521
Dead.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.365
- Sarah...
-just let me, let me.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.522
- She's not dead.
-She's dead, I know it!

35:48.600 --> 35:50.250
SARAH: You couldn't know that.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.004
KIRA: Please.
SARAH: You can't know that.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.730
I don't feel her any more!

35:53.800 --> 35:56.326
- Don't say that.
-I want to know why I am like this.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.010
And I don't want to go with you!

35:58.080 --> 35:59.844
- That's enough!
-I'm going with Rachel!

35:59.920 --> 36:01.843
- No, that's enough.
-Let me... (SCREAMS)

36:07.320 --> 36:08.810
You want to go with Rachel?

36:10.760 --> 36:11.761
You heard her.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.001
Leave.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.405
She wants to know why she's like this.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.289
We can't run from it any longer.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.001

(SARAH SOBS)

36:47.560 --> 36:49.164
Well, small mercies.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.161
Thank you.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.127
They've given themselves up
back at the house.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.202
I'd like to think
in some small heinous way,

36:58.280 --> 36:59.725
I had something to do with that.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.324
You disobeyed my orders.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.290
You made a mockery of me.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.442
Who are you now, exactly?

37:15.960 --> 37:18.406
It was all for you, Rachel. All of this.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.481
Simon.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.641
Would you make sure
the body is taken care of

37:23.720 --> 37:26.121
and see Mr Chevalier out to the street?

37:36.320 --> 37:37.401
(SIGHS)

37:52.400 --> 37:53.401
Let's go.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.729
FELIX: Good luck on the island, Ira.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.646
IRA: Thank you, Felix.

38:01.560 --> 38:02.561
It's time.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.321
Kira.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.401
I know it's been a sad day,

38:27.560 --> 38:29.801
but we are going to take
such good care of you.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.481
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

39:12.040 --> 39:13.565
(GUN COCKS)

39:21.600 --> 39:22.601
Jesus.

39:27.480 --> 39:30.563
- I'm not a ghost.
-Yeah, I heard.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.291
You're still the last person
I expected on my doorstep.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.041
Are you alone?

39:41.880 --> 39:44.008
Because I don't have that much
time and I don't know who to trust.

39:44.320 --> 39:45.481
Neither do I.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.767
But Sarah can't know that I'm here.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.289
This has to stay between us.

39:50.360 --> 39:53.091
Safer if they don't know
that we are communicating.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.601
I'm listening.

39:58.720 --> 40:00.609
<i>ALISON: I made
the fair what is it today.</i>

40:00.680 --> 40:03.411
And I won't be
side-lined by Nona Walker.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.131
Well, they said that you might do this.
Try to undermine me.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.565
(LAUGHS) Who said that?

40:07.640 --> 40:09.483
SARAH: She thinks Rachel's
gonna teach her who she is

40:09.560 --> 40:11.801
and I'm just this bitch
whojust says no.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.922
I am highland dancing later today.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.161
We have a search warrant.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.004
It's like our entire life is a lie.
