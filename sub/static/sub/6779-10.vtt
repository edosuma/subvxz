WEBVTT

00:05.330 --> 00:07.992
( theme music playing )

01:52.940 --> 01:54.874
( sobbing )

02:03.990 --> 02:06.618
( men chatting,
laughing )

02:11.490 --> 02:14.129
Nathaniel:
IT'S CRAZY.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.694
AND I GET THERE
AND GUESS WHAT?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.564
THERE IS NO DEATH!

02:22.670 --> 02:25.559
WASN'T IT A RELIEF
WHEN YOU REALIZED THAT?

02:25.670 --> 02:28.571
NATE! THANK GOD!

02:32.110 --> 02:34.317
( sighs )

02:52.770 --> 02:54.761
( groans )

03:19.500 --> 03:21.718
( cartoon voices
on TV)

03:23.870 --> 03:25.622
MAYA?

03:25.730 --> 03:27.869
MAYA?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.865
HEY, HONEY.

03:30.970 --> 03:33.507
WHERE'S MY DADDY?

03:34.640 --> 03:36.505
UM...

03:37.310 --> 03:39.619
DADDY'S NOT HERE.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.588
Girl on TV:
Ooh, I bet they love it!

03:45.550 --> 03:47.415
Man on TV:
Hi, Greg.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.387
Don't worry.
Whatever it was _
we wrll pay you for It.

03:50.490 --> 03:51.923
Woman on TV:
It's okay.

03:52.030 --> 03:54.794
( David sighs )

03:57.530 --> 03:59.669
DID YOU SLEEP
AT ALL?

04:03.070 --> 04:05.038
THE BOYS AREN'T UP YET,
ARE THEY?

04:05.140 --> 04:07.734
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF BREAKFAST.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.377
WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK TO BED AND TRY
AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP?

04:10.480 --> 04:12.869
I CAN'T.
I HAVE TO PICK UP
NATE'S BODY.

04:12.980 --> 04:14.641
( sighs )

04:14.750 --> 04:16.115
CAN'T RICO DO IT?

04:16.220 --> 04:18.381
I SHOULD DO IT, KEITH.
HE'S MY BROTHER.

04:18.490 --> 04:21.709
- WELL, MAYBE IT'S TOO MUCH.
- IT'S NOT.

04:21.820 --> 04:26.154
SO RIGHT AFTER BREAKFAST
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE BOYS
TO GET SUITS FOR THE FUNERAL.

04:26.260 --> 04:28.251
YOU KNOW,
I CAN BE WITH YOU TODAY.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.169
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THE BOYS WEAR.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.932
IT DOES MATI'ER TO ME.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.463
I'D START AT NORDSTROM'S.
THEY'RE HAVING A SALE.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.458
IT'S OKAY IF THE SLEEVES
ARE A LITTLE LONG,

04:37.570 --> 04:39.606
BUT IF YOU REALLY NEED
ALTERATIONS...

04:39.710 --> 04:41.905
TAKE THEM
TO LESTER'S ON VINE.

04:42.010 --> 04:45.446
TELL THEM THAT YOU NEED IT
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.644
SAY DAVID FISHER SENT YOU.
I WROTE WN THE ADDRESS.

05:11.310 --> 05:14.473
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WANTED
HIS ORGANS HARVESTED.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.669
HIS WIFE APPROVED IT.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

05:20.780 --> 05:23.044
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

05:25.550 --> 05:29.520
- IT'LL SAVE A LOT
OF PEOPLE'S LIVES.
- I KNOW.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.649
OH, FUCK!

05:50.750 --> 05:52.877
YOU WANT ONE?

05:52.980 --> 05:54.914
I GOT THEM FROM YOUR BROTHER,
BUT THEY SUCK.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.488
( horns honking )

06:00.460 --> 06:01.813
STUPID CUNT!

06:03.630 --> 06:06.087
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU
SOMETHING ELSE?

06:06.190 --> 06:07.953
YOGU RT?

06:08.060 --> 06:10.494
OATM EAL?

06:12.170 --> 06:14.058
HOW ABOUT
A SCOTCH AND SODA?

06:14.170 --> 06:16.195
IS IT TOO SOON
FOR ANOTHER PILL?

06:16.300 --> 06:18.962
- WHEN DID YOU
TAKE UR LAST ONE?
- THREE HOURS AGO.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.776
SURE, GO AHEAD.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.348
DON'T WORRY.
IF YOU GET ADDICTED...

06:23.450 --> 06:27.375
I HAVE A LOT OF
EXPERIENCE GETTING
PEOPLE THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.456
MM.

06:34.420 --> 06:37.480
- YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL.
- MM.

06:38.490 --> 06:42.119
I WISH YOU WERE
A FOOD MEDICATOR.

06:42.230 --> 06:44.767
WHEN MY SECOND
HUSBAND DIED...

06:44.870 --> 06:47.862
I COULDN'T STOP EATING
FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

06:47.970 --> 06:50.859
IT REALLY HELPED.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.737
HEY THERE!

06:53.840 --> 06:55.728
- HI.
- Bettina: THERE'S COFFEE!

06:55.840 --> 06:59.970
OH, NO THANKS.
I THINK I'VE ALREADY
HAD TOO MUCH COFFEE TODAY.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.547
I MADE YOU
SOME EGGS.

07:01.650 --> 07:03.845
YOU SEE HOW MUCH
YOUR MOM ENJOYED HERS.

07:03.950 --> 07:07.158
- ( door closes )
- OH, THANK YOU,
BUT I'M FINE.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.423
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL
DR. DiPAOLO?

07:10.530 --> 07:12.794
MOM, I TOLD YOU
HE WAS OUT OF TOWN.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.322
BUT THIS WAS
AN EMERGENCY.

07:14.430 --> 07:16.921
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
NO ONE EVEN SPOKE TO HIM.

07:17.030 --> 07:19.464
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS
GOING TO BE FINE.

07:19.570 --> 07:22.334
HE WAS TALKING
TO US, MOM.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.135
HE REALLY
SEEMED OKAY.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.707
BUT NONE OF IT
MAKES ANY SENSE!

07:25.810 --> 07:27.869
SOMETIMES THINGS
JUST DON'T.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.413
DAVID, IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO, LIKE, HELP YOU?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.078
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHY WOULD I NEED ANY HELP?

07:35.180 --> 07:38.047
I JUST MEAN,
LIKE, DEALING.

07:38.150 --> 07:39.651
I CAN DEAL,
THANK YOU.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.729
YOU CAN HELP ME
CALL PEOPLE.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.786
- THE LIST IS
IN THE OFFICE.
- OKAY.

07:44.890 --> 07:48.223
- WHEN'S THE SERVICE?
- TOMORROW AT NOON.

07:48.330 --> 07:52.460
I THINK WE SHOULD WAIT
A FEW DAYS SO PEOPLE
HAVE TIME TO GET HERE.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.388
NATE DIDN'T WANT
TO EMBALMED.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.139
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- HE TOLD ME.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.231
TWICE.

08:01.510 --> 08:04.343
BUT WE'RE GOING TO--
( sighs )

08:04.450 --> 08:06.247
WHAT?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.618
NOTHING. NEVER MIND.

08:14.920 --> 08:20.324
THIS WAS THE PRE-NEED
HE FILLED OUT BEFORE
THE FIRST SURGERY.

08:20.430 --> 08:22.819
BUT THAT WAS
TH REE YEARS AGO.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.818
HE SAID HE WANTED
A CREMATION

08:24.930 --> 08:29.435
AND RABBI ARI HOFFMAN
TO DO THE SERVICE.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.839
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO MARRY US
THE FIRST TIME.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.579
OH, RIGHT.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.841
BUT JUST LAST WEEK

08:37.950 --> 08:41.818
HE SAID HE WANTED
A "GREEN FUNERAL."

08:41.920 --> 08:43.945
WHAT'S THAT?

08:44.050 --> 08:47.884
IT'S AN
ENVIRONMENTALLY, UH...

08:47.990 --> 08:50.379
FRIENDLY PROCESS.
IT'S NATURAL.

08:50.490 --> 08:55.029
THE BODY IS
PLACED IN THE GROUND,
WRAPPED IN A SHROUD.

08:55.130 --> 08:57.064
NO EMBALMING OR CASKET.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.867
AND PEOPLE OFI'EN PURCHASE
A RESTING PLACE

09:00.970 --> 09:03.905
IN A DESIGNATED PARK
KIND OF AREA

09:04.010 --> 09:06.774
AS A WAY TO CONSERVE
THE LAND.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.372
WELL, THAT SOUNDS NICE.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.938
OFFICIALLY,
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HONOR
THE SIGNED DOCUMENT,

09:14.050 --> 09:15.779
BUT I THINK HE...

09:15.880 --> 09:19.680
INTENDED TO CHANGE
THE PRE-NEED AND
JUST NEVER--

09:22.220 --> 09:24.688
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO.

09:26.630 --> 09:29.599
SO IT'S UP TO YOU
AS HIS SPOUSE

09:29.700 --> 09:31.964
TO DECIDE WHAT YOU THINK
HE WOULD HAVE WANTED.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.992
I HAVE NO IDEA.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.534
NO FUCKING IDEA.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.700
I MEAN, RABBI ARI?

09:39.810 --> 09:44.042
AND NOW, APPARENTLY,
HE IS SOME KIND OF QUAKER.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.311
WAS, I MEAN.

09:50.350 --> 09:53.353
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE
SHOULD JUST ASK MAGGIE
WHAT HE WOULD HAVE WANTED.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.587
WHAT DOES MAGGIE
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

09:55.690 --> 09:58.329
ARE YOU MAKING DECISIONS
ABOUT NATE'S FUNERAL?

09:58.430 --> 10:01.251
WE'RE JUST DISCUSSING
WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE WANTED.

10:01.360 --> 10:04.693
DOESN'T MY OPINION
MEAN SOMETHING?
HE'S MY SON.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.689
I-I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.600
I WANT HIM BURIED
IN THE FAMILY PLOT
NEXT TO HIS FATHER.

10:11.710 --> 10:14.235
WELL, HE WANTED TO BE BURIED
IN A NATURE PRESERVE.

10:14.340 --> 10:18.606
- BUT I WANT HIM NEXT TO ME.
- WELL, THEN YOU CAN
GO THERE TOO THEN.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.410
( groans )

10:25.520 --> 10:27.112
( snorts )

10:27.220 --> 10:30.053
( birds chirping )

10:32.360 --> 10:34.157
( mouse clicking )

10:34.260 --> 10:35.898
HEY, DAVID.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.321
YOU OKAY?

10:42.070 --> 10:44.664
I KNOW. I STILL
CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

10:44.770 --> 10:49.173
IT'S LIKE...
NOW WE JUST GO ON
WITH EVERYTHING?

10:49.280 --> 10:51.475
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO.

10:51.580 --> 10:54.617
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.449
I GUESS SO.

10:56.550 --> 10:59.189
(sighs)
UH, SO, UM...

10:59.290 --> 11:00.757
LOOK, I'LL, UM...

11:00.860 --> 11:04.387
- I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE FELIX PICKUP.
- WHAT?

11:04.490 --> 11:05.889
THE GUY AT
THE NURSING HOME.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.821
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE WHOLE FUNERAL.

11:07.930 --> 11:09.795
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.822
WE CAN'T TAKE
THAT FUNERAL.

11:11.930 --> 11:15.696
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE HERE
DURING NATE'S SERVICE.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.461
DAVID, THEY HAVE
A PRE-NEED.

11:17.570 --> 11:19.970
- ( sighs )
- THEY PAID FOR
THE FUNERAL 10 YEARS AGO.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.401
RICO, PLEASE,
JUST WORK IT OUT.

11:29.650 --> 11:31.845
MAYA, EAT YOUR
APPLE SAUCE.

11:31.950 --> 11:33.156
NO.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.457
( shouts )
WELL, YOU HAVE TO
EAT SOMETHING!

11:36.560 --> 11:38.528
( pottery shatters )

11:38.630 --> 11:41.155
( sighs )
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

11:42.330 --> 11:44.389
( shards tinkling )

11:45.800 --> 11:47.939
I'M SO SORRY.
I, UM...

11:48.040 --> 11:50.531
I KNOCKED OVER
YOUR PLANT.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.404
I'LL REPLACE IT.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.507
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:58.610 --> 12:00.919
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT NEED--

12:01.550 --> 12:03.415
UM...

12:06.520 --> 12:09.182
I MADE YOU GUYS
A QUICHE.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.429
( sighs )
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BOTHER YOU.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.122
I WAS JUST
GONNA LEAVE IT.

12:13.230 --> 12:15.289
BUT, UH, THEN...

12:16.930 --> 12:19.228
OH, BRENDA,
I'M SO SORRY.

12:19.330 --> 12:21.036
WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF QUAKER THING?

12:21.140 --> 12:22.937
YOU FUCK SOMEONE'S HUSBAND
TO DEATH

12:23.040 --> 12:25.929
AND THEN YOU BRING THEM
A QUICHE?

12:26.040 --> 12:29.578
WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST ADMIT IT?

12:29.680 --> 12:31.671
IT WOULD BE
SUCH RELIEF TO KNOW

12:31.780 --> 12:34.044
WHEN MY MARRIAGE TURNED
INTO A TOTAL FUCKING LIE.

12:34.150 --> 12:37.938
- OH, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
- LIKE WHAT? GOD!

12:39.150 --> 12:41.516
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING
YOU'RE IMAGINING.

12:41.620 --> 12:43.019
NATE LOVED YOU.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.928
I DON'T NEED YOU TO TELL ME
HOW MY HUSBAND FELT ABOUT ME!

12:46.030 --> 12:48.498
EVEN IF HE WAS
PISSED OFF AT ME,

12:48.600 --> 12:52.092
HE CERTAINLY
WASN'T IN LOVE WITH YOU
EVEN IF HE SAID HE WAS.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.328
NATE COULD BE
VERY CONVINCING THAT WAY.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.904
BUT ALL HE EVER WANTED
WAS SOMEONE WHO COULD
MAKE HIM FEEL

13:00.010 --> 13:03.548
LIKE HE WAS A BETTER MAN
THAN HE ACTUALLY WAS.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.539
COULD'VE BEEN ANYONE.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.839
WHY DIDN'T I EVER GET
A STUPID CELL PHONE?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.999
'CAUSE YOU HATE 'EM.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.773
WELL, IF I HAD ONE
LIKE EVERY OTHER PERSON
IN THE WORLD...

13:33.880 --> 13:36.235
IT WOULDN'T HAVE
SAVED HIM.

13:45.190 --> 13:46.509
( sighs )

13:46.620 --> 13:51.284
WHY DID CLAIRE
HAVE TO MAKE ME
GO GET MY HAIR CUT?

13:51.390 --> 13:54.120
I'VE BEEN CUTTING
MY OWN HAIR FOR YEARS.

13:54.230 --> 13:57.427
WHY DID SHE HAVE
TO TEASE ME ABOUT IT NOW?

13:58.900 --> 14:01.562
WHEN DID YOU HAVE
YOUR LAST PILL, HON?

14:01.670 --> 14:03.763
I-I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER PILL.

14:03.870 --> 14:05.599
( sobbing )

14:05.710 --> 14:08.099
I WANT MY SON.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.974
I WANT
MY BEAUTIFUL SON.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.441
I KNOW.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.278
I KNOW YOU DO.

14:20.390 --> 14:22.358
I KNOW YOU DO.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.202
Nathaniel:
THIS WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

14:42.140 --> 14:45.576
- ( sighs ) I KNOW.
- NATE?

14:45.680 --> 14:47.739
NATE'S THE ONE WHO MA'ITERS.

14:47.850 --> 14:50.284
YOU KNOW,
I LOVE YOU, SON,

14:50.390 --> 14:53.416
BUT NATE-- ( sighs )
NATE'S MY LITTLE MAN.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.758
I'M A MAN, DAD.

14:56.860 --> 14:59.749
OH, DON'T GET
YOUR ASS IN A KNOT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

14:59.860 --> 15:01.851
YOU WERE THE ONE
WE THOUGHT WE COULD LOSE.

15:01.960 --> 15:05.566
WHAT, WITH AIDS
AND PICKING UP STRANGE MEN
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

15:05.670 --> 15:08.639
AND SCREWING
A WHORE WITH NO CONDOM--
ALL THAT SORT OF THING.

15:08.740 --> 15:12.062
YOU'VE BEEN BEGGING FOR
SOME KIND OF ANNIHILATION
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.400
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- IT'S LIKE A COSMIC JOKE.

15:14.510 --> 15:15.875
( laughs )
OH, GOD.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.345
YOUR POOR MOTHER.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.941
SHE-SHE MUST BE
GOING INSANE.

15:20.050 --> 15:21.677
HE WAS HER FAVORITE.

15:21.780 --> 15:25.546
- WHO WAS YOURS?
- CLAIRE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
MY LI'ITLE GAL.

15:25.650 --> 15:28.210
- YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS.
- YOU BARELY EVEN KNEW
CLAIRE.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.550
PRE'ITY LI'ITLE
H EARTBREAKER.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.628
JUST LIKE HER MOM...

15:32.730 --> 15:34.391
BEFORE SHE CRACKED.
( chuckles )

15:34.500 --> 15:38.425
- YOU MAKE ME SICK.
- THE FEELING'S MUTUAL,
CUPCAKE.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.061
COME ON, DURRELL,
WHERE ARE YOU?

15:43.170 --> 15:45.730
ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING.
I'M COMING.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.398
( groans )

15:47.510 --> 15:50.001
NO. NO, NO,
YOU HAVE TO WEAR
YOUR NEW SHOES.

15:50.110 --> 15:51.805
THE PANTS DRAG
ON THE FLOOR WITH THOSE.

15:51.910 --> 15:55.118
JUST PUT THEM ON.
WE'VE GO TO DROP OFF
SOMETHING AT MY BOSS'S

15:55.220 --> 15:56.414
BEFORE WE GO
TO THE FISHER'S.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.545
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU
THE PANTS ARE TOO LONG.

15:58.650 --> 16:01.915
( sighs )
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE WE CAN
GET THEM HEMMED ON THE WAY.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.625
BUT THEN WE HAVE TO
LEAVE NOW.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.498
Ruth:
DAVID?

16:17.670 --> 16:19.604
( gasps )

16:19.710 --> 16:21.268
EXCUSE ME.

16:21.380 --> 16:25.373
I'M SURE BRENDA BROUGHT
SOME CLOTHES, BUT I...

16:26.880 --> 16:29.940
I HAPPENED TO SEE
HIS-- HIS BEST SUIT,

16:30.050 --> 16:32.314
FRESH FROM THE CLEANER.

16:32.420 --> 16:35.480
- WE'RE NOT HAVING A VIEWING.
- WHY NOT?

16:35.590 --> 16:39.549
MOM, I TOLD YOU
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
EMBALMED OR MADE UP.

16:39.660 --> 16:41.890
BUT PEOPLE NEED A VIEWING.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.525
YOU CAN LOOK AT HIM NOW.

17:48.030 --> 17:50.169
WHEN HE CAME
OUT OF THE SURGERY

17:50.270 --> 17:54.195
WHAT EXACTLY DID
THE DOCTOR SAY?

17:54.300 --> 17:56.632
MOM, I'VE TOLD YOU THIS
100 TIMES.

17:56.740 --> 17:59.937
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
CLEAR ABOUT IT.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.974
IF HE SAID
EVERYTHING WAS FINE

18:02.080 --> 18:05.140
AND NATE WAS AWAKE
AND TALKING, THEN...

18:06.280 --> 18:08.771
CLEARLY SOMETHING
WENT TERRIBLY WRONG!

18:08.880 --> 18:10.438
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I KILLED HIM?

18:10.550 --> 18:12.643
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO GET ME TO SAY?

18:12.750 --> 18:15.719
- HOW DARE YOU
SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY!
- HOW DARE YOU!

18:15.820 --> 18:17.754
I LOST HIM TOO, MOM!

18:19.560 --> 18:22.688
ALL YOU'VE BEEN DOING
IS ACCUSING ME OF DOING
THE WRONG THING!

18:22.800 --> 18:24.392
AT LEAST I WAS THERE!

18:34.640 --> 18:36.403
FUCK!

18:36.510 --> 18:37.875
WHAT?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.314
I, UM...

18:42.480 --> 18:45.119
I PICKED UP
THE PROGRAMS.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.426
THANK YOU.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.691
- THANKS.
- MM-HMM.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.153
( phone rings )

18:55.260 --> 18:58.718
- TED FAIRWELL.
- Hi, it's Claire.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.832
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

19:00.940 --> 19:02.862
I'M BAD.

19:02.970 --> 19:07.669
UM, MY BROTHER IS DEAD.

19:08.980 --> 19:11.073
OH MY GOD.

19:11.180 --> 19:12.670
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:12.780 --> 19:16.773
UH, I KIND OF
HAVE TO GET OUT
OF HERE AND, UM...

19:16.880 --> 19:19.747
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DRIVE.

19:19.850 --> 19:22.580
ARE YOU LIKE
REALLY BUSY?

19:22.690 --> 19:24.920
UM, NO.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.679
NO.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.293
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.765
- Man: JESUS CHRIST!
- ROGER?

19:35.870 --> 19:38.065
- ( glass shatters )
- Man: YOU TRASHED ME!

19:38.170 --> 19:41.071
- YOU TWO STAY HERE.
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER!

19:41.180 --> 19:42.431
GOD DAMN IT! RIVER!

19:42.540 --> 19:45.100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT WAS MY COOMB'S KI'ITY!

19:45.210 --> 19:47.519
"TIT FOR TAT," YOU SAID.
YOU GOT YOUR FUCKING TIT!

19:47.620 --> 19:49.542
NOW WHERE'S
MY COCKSUCKING TAT?

19:49.650 --> 19:51.515
I HAD TO CALL IN
A LOT OF FAVORS
TO GET YOU THAT PART.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.281
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THEY FIRED YOU AFTER
THE TABLE READ!

19:53.390 --> 19:55.119
I WAS "MARKY," MAN!

19:55.220 --> 19:56.687
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THEM
I HAVE THE CHOPS?

19:56.790 --> 19:59.179
- I'M COOL!
- I SAID YOU WERE
A COMIC GENIUS.

19:59.290 --> 20:02.225
YOU THINK I WASN'T EMBARRASSED
WHEN THEY TOLD ME YOU
STUNK UP THE PLACE?

20:02.330 --> 20:04.195
YOU DIDN'T FIGHT FOR ME.
EVERYONE SELLS ME OUT

20:04.300 --> 20:07.337
- MY FUCKING LIFE!
- WHAT?

20:07.440 --> 20:10.000
YOU NEED TO
CALM DOWN NOW!

20:10.100 --> 20:11.601
NOW WHAT AM I
GONNA DO?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.735
I TOLD MY MOM.
I DID A MAILING!

20:13.840 --> 20:15.979
KEITH, I NEED
YOU TO TAKE HIM
TO THE VAN NUYS AIRPORT.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.173
I'VE GOT A FRIEND AT WARNER'S
LE'ITING ME USE THE JET.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.647
- I CAN'T GO TO VAN NUYS.
- THAT'S A REOCCURRING ON
"TWO AND A HALF MEN"

20:21.750 --> 20:24.583
- I'M PERFECT FOR!
- I JUST WANT TO SEND HIM
O CABO TILL HE SE'ITLES DOWN.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.409
- Keith: I'VE GOT MY KIDS.
- IT'S FINE. TAKE THEM
WITH YOU.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.283
I JUST WANNA SHOW YOU
HOW GOOD I CAN BE.

20:29.390 --> 20:30.857
SHUT UP, TREVOR.
YOU GOT YOUR SHOT.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.258
LOOK, WE'RE ON
OUR WAY TO A FUNERAL.
DAVID'S BROTHER DIED.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.191
I'M SO SORRY.
THAT'S AWFUL.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.497
- IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?
- YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF THIS YOURSELF.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.034
OH, I'M SORRY, SWEETIE,
BUT I'VE BEEN OVERPAYING
YOU FOR A YEAR.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.608
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE REALLY NEEDED YOU
TO DO SOMETHING.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.759
UH, KEITH,
WE'VE GOT TO GET
MY PANTS FIXED.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.872
Roger:
YOU CAN'T GO TO A FUNERAL
WITHOUT THOSE HEMMED.

20:48.980 --> 20:51.005
LEAVE THE BOYS WITH ME
AND I'LL HAVE MY GIRL
DO THEM.

20:51.110 --> 20:53.544
- SHE'S A GENIUS.
- I'M NOT LEAVING
MY BOYS WITH YOU!

20:53.650 --> 20:55.413
WE'LL HEM THE PANTS
AND DROP THEM OFF
WITH DAVID.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.114
PLEASE, LET ME
HELP YOU HELP ME.

20:58.220 --> 21:01.656
KEITH, I'M A GOOD FATHER.
I CAN HANDLE TWO KIDS
FOR AN HOUR.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.079
OKAY.

21:03.190 --> 21:05.158
BUT DON'T TALK TO 'EM
TOO MUCH.

21:05.260 --> 21:07.694
- CAN WE HAVE BEER?
- Keith: NO!

21:08.830 --> 21:12.288
- HAVE WE MET SOMEWHERE?
- NO! SHUT UP!

21:15.970 --> 21:17.938
OH, SWEETIE.

21:20.010 --> 21:22.035
MY GOD.

21:22.140 --> 21:24.472
DAMN, YOU'VE HAD
A SHI'ITY YEAR.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.011
- I GOT YOUR DRESS.
- THANKS.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.588
THEY SWORE TO ME
IT WOULD FIT.

21:32.690 --> 21:34.954
AND I PICKED UP ONE
FOR MAYA.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.824
AND I BROUGHT
SOME LOX AND VODKA.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.558
GREAT. I CAN'T DRINK.
LOX HAS MERCURY.

21:40.660 --> 21:43.891
OH, PLEASE,
A COUPLE SHOTS OF STOLI
WON'T KILL THE BABY.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.628
YOU KNOW,
IN MY DAY WE USED
TO SIT ON OUR ASS

21:46.730 --> 21:48.834
SMOKING PARLIAMENTS
FOR NINE MONTHS.

21:48.940 --> 21:52.159
TODAY, YOU HAVE
ONE PIECE OF BRIE
AND EVERYBODY GOES BERSERK.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.828
( pours vodka )

21:53.940 --> 21:56.238
COME O SWEETH EART.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.149
HERE, HAVE SOME OF THIS.
IT'LL TAKE THE EDGE OFF.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.047
I DON'T WANNA
TAKE THE EDGE OFF.

22:02.950 --> 22:06.283
I GUESS I'M JUST
BLATHERING ON LIKE AN IDIOT.

22:06.390 --> 22:07.948
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, HONEY.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.812
I'M JUST SO SORRY.

22:12.430 --> 22:14.728
HELLO, YOU.

22:14.830 --> 22:16.718
HOW ARE YOU, MAYA?

22:16.830 --> 22:18.923
I THINK SHE'S
A LITTLE CONFUSED.

22:19.030 --> 22:20.361
WHERE'S MY DADDY?

22:20.470 --> 22:23.906
OH, GOD!
( whimpers )
I DON'T--

22:26.540 --> 22:28.599
YOUR DADDY...

22:28.710 --> 22:32.146
HAS GONE AWAY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.275
MOM, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT!

22:34.380 --> 22:37.349
HONEY, DADDY'S DEAD.

22:37.450 --> 22:39.782
THAT MEANS THAT HE'S NOT
COMING BACK EVER.

22:39.890 --> 22:42.518
BRENDA! JESUS!
YOU KNOW, SOl-TEN IT UP
A LITTLE.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.656
THAT'S WHAT
THE BOOK SAID TO DO.
I EVEN WENT ONLINE.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.399
THEY ALL SAY
YOU HAVE TO BE CLEAR
OR SHE GETS CONFUSED.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.127
WHEN IS DADDY COMING BACK?

22:49.230 --> 22:51.061
DADDY'S DEAD.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.126
REMEMBER,
LIKE, NEMO'S MOM?

22:53.230 --> 22:55.095
REMEMBER HOW WE TALKED
ABOUT THAT?

22:55.200 --> 22:57.509
- AH...
- YOU KNOW WHAT, BRENDA?

22:57.610 --> 22:59.566
I THINK YOU SHOULD SAVE
THIS DISCUSSION

22:59.670 --> 23:02.173
FOR A TIME WHEN YOU'RE
LESS INSANE WITH GRIEF.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.498
I'M NOT INSANE
WITH GRIEF, MOM!

23:04.610 --> 23:06.373
SWEETIE, YOU GO ON.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.142
GO AHEAD, PLAY WITH
YOUR TOYS, SWEETHEART.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.389
HAVE YOU TALKED TO BILLY?
HE'S NOT RETURNING MY CALLS.

23:11.490 --> 23:14.584
OH, I SUPPOSE
HE'S STILL IN DUBAI.

23:14.690 --> 23:17.250
JESUS, I HOPE THEY HAVEN'T
TAKEN HIM HOSTAGE.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.918
HE'S NOT VERY DOCILE.

23:19.030 --> 23:21.248
I'M SURE HE HASN'T BEEN
TAKEN HOSTAGE, MOM.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.760
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M A WRECK.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.464
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE BOTH WIDOWS.

23:26.570 --> 23:27.992
IT'S JUST SO HORRIFYING.

23:28.100 --> 23:29.590
AT LEAST YOU'VE GOT
OLIVIER.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.828
WELL, HE WALKED OUT ON ME
LAST WEEK.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.472
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE TODAY ABOUT ME,

23:37.580 --> 23:41.277
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
I WANT TO FUCKING
KILL MYSELF.

23:41.380 --> 23:45.612
I MEAN, GOD,
THE PAIN IS JUST SEARING.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.288
I KNOW IT'S
NOT THE SAME.

23:52.390 --> 23:55.188
BUT WE'RE
BOTH ALONE NOW.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.256
NO, IT'S NOT THE SAME.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.521
NOT AT ALL.

23:59.630 --> 24:03.737
SO... ARE WE GOING
ANYWHERE IN PARTICULAR?

24:03.840 --> 24:05.637
NO.

24:06.510 --> 24:08.876
DO YOU MIND JUST DRIVING?

24:08.980 --> 24:11.039
I DON'T MIND.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.209
( pop music playing )

24:14.920 --> 24:16.979
( chuckles )
WHAT IS THIS, A MIX?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.082
YEAH.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.750
I LOVE "TOP 40."
( chuckles )

24:21.860 --> 24:25.557
I'M SORRY,
BUT IT JUST SOUNDS
SO GOOD SOMETIMES.

24:26.790 --> 24:29.122
* I'll do what it takes

24:29.230 --> 24:30.891
* Till I touch the slq

24:31.000 --> 24:34.265
* Make a wish
take a chance *

24:34.370 --> 24:36.258
* Make a change...

24:36.370 --> 24:38.861
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT

24:38.970 --> 24:40.904
THESE STUPID FIGHTS
I HAD WITH MY BROTHER,

24:41.010 --> 24:45.879
NOT LIKE ANY OF
THE GOOD TIMES,
OR WHATEVER.

24:45.980 --> 24:49.518
- ISN'T THAKCISIORRIBLE?

24:49.620 --> 24:52.384
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
NICE ABOUT MY SISTER.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.549
BUT I LIKE NATE.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.527
I MEAN, YOU KNOW I DID.

24:59.630 --> 25:03.327
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF?
- JUST WEIRD THINGS.

25:03.430 --> 25:06.228
LIKE THIS TIME, UM...

25:06.330 --> 25:09.367
IT WAS RIGHT AI-TER
MY DAD DIED.

25:09.470 --> 25:12.234
I HAD TO WRITE
THIS IDIOTIC ENGLISH PAPER

25:12.340 --> 25:16.106
WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO INTERVIEW

25:16.210 --> 25:19.839
THE PERSON IN YOUR FAMILY
THAT YOU KNEW THE LEAST.

25:19.950 --> 25:21.941
MY DAD WAS DEAD.
( scoffs )

25:22.050 --> 25:27.488
AND IT WAS
PRE'ITY MUCH A TOSS-UP
BETWEEN THOSE TWO ANYWAY.

25:27.590 --> 25:32.459
UNTIL I ASKED NATE
IF I COULD, UH...

25:32.560 --> 25:36.189
INTERVIEW HIM,
AND HE SAID NO.

25:37.730 --> 25:40.563
IT WAS NOT LIKE IT WAS
SOME BIG TRAUMATIC THING.

25:40.670 --> 25:43.434
IT WAS JUST...

25:43.540 --> 25:45.838
I'M SORRY.

25:45.940 --> 25:49.501
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS SO GROSS.

25:49.610 --> 25:52.841
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

25:52.950 --> 25:56.738
IT'S OKAY.

25:56.850 --> 26:00.286
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT THAT TIME!

26:03.660 --> 26:06.549
THANK YOU FOR
BEING SO FLEXIBLE.
OKAY. BYE-BYE.

26:06.660 --> 26:08.855
- CAN YOU ZIP ME?
- OH.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.019
- ( sighs )
- WHERE'S ANGIE?

26:11.130 --> 26:12.961
SHE CALLED.
SHE'S GONNA BE
10 MINUTES LATE.

26:13.070 --> 26:15.834
- THAT'S 20 MINUTES. FUCK!
- HEY.

26:15.940 --> 26:19.307
- THE KIDS CAN HEAR YOU.
- WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
WITH THE BUSINESS

26:19.410 --> 26:23.699
NOW THAT THERE'S NO ONE
TO STOP DAVID FROM SPENDING
300 GRAND ON A CREMATORIUM?

26:23.810 --> 26:25.903
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT?

26:26.010 --> 26:27.875
DO YOU KNOW HOW
LI'ITLE SAVINGS WE HAVE?

26:27.980 --> 26:30.175
WHAT IF SOMETHING
WERE TO HAPPEN TO ME?
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

26:30.280 --> 26:33.078
- YOU AND THE KIDS,
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE?
- NOTHING IS GONNA HAPPEN.

26:33.190 --> 26:35.488
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!

26:35.590 --> 26:38.957
- WE STILL DON'T
HAVE ANY LIFE INSURANCE.
- WE'LL GET IT TOMORROW.

26:39.060 --> 26:40.721
WHERE IS SHE?

26:40.830 --> 26:42.923
DID SHE NEED TO GET
HER OUTFIT RIGHT
FOR BABY-SITTING?

26:43.030 --> 26:45.396
YOU WANT TO GO
AHEAD OF ME?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.593
- IS THAT OKAY?
- YEAH.

26:47.700 --> 26:51.136
OKAY. UH, THEN
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.901
OKAY.

27:07.390 --> 27:09.517
- ( door opens )
- Anthony: HE'S NOT THERE.

27:09.620 --> 27:11.679
Durrell:
YES, HE IS TOO.

27:11.790 --> 27:14.327
WOW, YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.318
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THE LENGTH?

27:16.430 --> 27:17.920
IT'S PERFECT.

27:18.030 --> 27:20.498
DAVID, I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.397
THANK YOU.
WHERE'S KEITH?

27:25.570 --> 27:27.777
WE HAD A SITUATION.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.734
Keith:
I'M SO SORRY,

27:29.840 --> 27:31.307
BUT HE JUST THREW
THIS GUY AT ME.

27:31.410 --> 27:33.810
I JUST GOT TO GET HIM
ON A PLANE AND THEN I CAN GO.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.172
WELL, COULDN'T YOU
JUST SAY NO TODAY?

27:36.280 --> 27:37.611
I know. I'm sorry.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.416
But I swear I'll be
there soon, okay?

27:40.520 --> 27:41.987
DAVID!

27:42.090 --> 27:44.923
( sighs )

27:45.030 --> 27:46.986
THIS IS TOTAL
BULLSHIT, MAN.

27:47.090 --> 27:49.650
I'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.766
HEY, I KNOW WHERE
I KNOW YOU FROM.

27:53.870 --> 27:56.259
YOU'RE THAT GUY
IN THE BLOWJOB VIDEO.

27:56.370 --> 27:58.338
SORRY, WRONG GUY.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.101
YOU ARE TOO, MAN.

28:00.210 --> 28:04.670
- THE ONE WHERE ROGER'S
GIVING YOU HEAD.
- A VIDEO?

28:04.780 --> 28:07.169
DUDE, I'VE SEEN IT
LIKE 20 TIMES.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.941
ROGER PLAYED IT
EVERY TIME WE HAD SEX.

28:09.050 --> 28:11.484
HE CAN'T COME
WITHOUT IT.

28:11.590 --> 28:15.253
DOES HE PAY YOU EXTRA FOR THAT
OR IS THAT PART OF THE JOB?

28:18.890 --> 28:20.653
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

28:20.760 --> 28:22.352
HEY, HEY!

28:22.460 --> 28:24.894
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.729
( pop music playing )

28:26.830 --> 28:28.798
SO WHY DON'T YOU LIKE
YOUR SISTER?

28:28.900 --> 28:31.460
JUST THE OLDER ONE--
CAROLINE.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.630
SHE'S JUST KIND OF MEAN.

28:36.740 --> 28:39.846
WHICH IS KIND OF WEIRD,
BECAUSE SHE DOES
THIS NOBLE WORK

28:39.950 --> 28:41.713
HELPING REFUGEES.

28:41.820 --> 28:45.210
SO TO THE WORLD AT LARGE
SHE'S A SAINT.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.481
BUT IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY
A PERSON IN HER LIFE,

28:47.590 --> 28:49.251
SHE'S JUST A BITCH.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.887
LIKE WHEN MY LI'ITLE SISTER
WAS GOING THROUGH CHEMO

28:52.990 --> 28:57.097
CAROLINE CAME BY
TO HELP HER LIKE TWICE...

28:57.930 --> 29:00.524
IN THREE YEARS.

29:00.630 --> 29:03.030
THAT IS PRE'ITY BAD.

29:03.140 --> 29:05.438
IS YOUR OTHER
SISTER OKAY?

29:05.540 --> 29:07.735
YEAH. BETSY.

29:08.810 --> 29:10.949
SHE WAS LUCKY.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.748
THAT'S GOOD.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.826
( sighs )

29:24.660 --> 29:26.457
I HAVE TO GO BACK.

29:27.490 --> 29:30.891
OKAY. OKAY.

29:35.670 --> 29:37.399
THERE YOU ARE.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.205
HOW ARE YOU?

29:41.840 --> 29:44.809
- ( printer whirring )
- THANKS FOR MAKING IT.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.272
ARE THE BOYS OKAY?

29:47.380 --> 29:50.269
THEY'RE UPSTAIRS
IN A STATE OF BLISS.

29:50.380 --> 29:52.484
ROGER BOUGHT THEM iPODS.

30:04.330 --> 30:06.992
BUT WHY WOULD GOD
TAKE SOMEONE'S SON

30:07.100 --> 30:11.764
AT THE ONE MOMENT THEY WERE
EVER IN THEIR WHOLE LIVES
NOT ABLE TO BE WITH HIM?

30:11.870 --> 30:14.430
WHAT KIND OF
A MESSAGE IS THAT?

30:14.540 --> 30:18.101
I DON'T THINK IT'S HELPFUL
TO SEE IT AS A MESSAGE TO YOU.

30:18.210 --> 30:19.973
THEN WHY WOULD IT
HAPPEN THAT WAY?

30:20.080 --> 30:22.776
UNLESS THERE
REALLY IS NO GOD.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.815
IT'S NATURAL TO BE ANGRY.

30:25.920 --> 30:30.209
BUT MAYBE IT'S BEST
TO VIEW GOD AS A LIGHT

30:30.320 --> 30:34.120
THROUGH THIS DARK TIME,
AS OPPOSED TO SEEING HIM
AS THE CAUSE OF IT.

30:34.230 --> 30:37.597
- GOD IS AN ASSHOLE!
- S, GOD IS A HUGE ASSHOLE!

30:37.700 --> 30:40.498
AND I FUCKING
HATE HIM FOR THIS.

30:43.100 --> 30:46.160
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
THROUGH THIS, HONEY,
ALL RIGHT?

30:46.270 --> 30:50.775
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

30:50.880 --> 30:54.077
( "Knockin' on Heaven's Door"
Playing )

31:08.460 --> 31:10.826
( sniffles )

31:10.930 --> 31:14.388
* Mama, take this badge
off of me *

31:17.070 --> 31:21.939
* I can't use it anymore

31:24.550 --> 31:28.975
* It's getting dark,
too dark to see *

31:31.120 --> 31:35.489
* Feel like I'm knockin'
on heaven's door *

31:37.760 --> 31:42.424
*_Knock knock knock
knockin' on heaven's door... *

31:45.700 --> 31:48.089
YOU COULD'VE DRESSED.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.002
I COULDN'T.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.229
THE REST OF US MANAGED.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.979
WELL, THE REST
OF YOU WIN.

31:59.310 --> 32:02.848
* Knock knock knock
knockin' on heaven's door. *

32:02.950 --> 32:04.645
( music fades )

32:12.430 --> 32:14.648
( sighs )

32:16.030 --> 32:19.022
I THINK WE'RE
ALL IN SHOCK.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.230
TH REE YEARS AGO...

32:23.340 --> 32:27.037
WE PRAYED FOR NATE'S LIFE.

32:27.140 --> 32:30.405
AND WE THOUGHT OUR PRAYERS
WERE ANSWERED.

32:30.510 --> 32:32.705
NOW, WE HAVE TO PRAY

32:32.810 --> 32:35.711
FOR HELP MAKING SENSE
OF THIS LOSS.

32:35.820 --> 32:38.983
BECAUSE-- UM...

32:39.090 --> 32:41.513
BECAUSE WE'VE LOST A LOT--

32:42.490 --> 32:44.754
A SON...

32:44.860 --> 32:46.680
A FATHER...

32:46.790 --> 32:48.690
A BROTHER...

32:48.800 --> 32:50.688
A HUSBAND...

32:50.800 --> 32:53.018
A COLLEAGUE...

32:55.000 --> 32:57.764
TO ME
AN INSPIRATION.

32:57.870 --> 33:02.898
HE HAD
A NATURAL SENSE...

33:03.010 --> 33:06.571
HE HAD A NATURAL SENSE
OF WHAT TO SAY TO PEOPLE
WHEN THEY WERE GRIEVING.

33:06.680 --> 33:11.117
AND, UH, I JUST
THINK HE'D KNOW WHAT
TO SAY TO HELP US...

33:11.220 --> 33:15.554
IF ONLY HE WHERE HERE.
THANK YOU.

33:19.430 --> 33:21.125
(crying )

33:21.230 --> 33:23.323
( objects jingling )

33:29.170 --> 33:31.536
( Margaret blows nose )

33:46.450 --> 33:50.011
I'M DAVID FISHER
AND NATE WAS MY BIG BROTHER.

33:51.660 --> 33:54.322
WHEN WE WERE KIDS
I USED TO GET PICKED ON
AT SCHOOL.

33:54.430 --> 33:57.524
I HAD COME HOME
WITH MY FACE

33:57.630 --> 33:59.359
OR MY PRIDE BRUISED,

33:59.470 --> 34:02.359
AND NATE WOULD MAKE ME
TELL HIM WHO DID IT.

34:02.470 --> 34:05.530
AND HE WOULD
GO TALK TO WHOEVER
WAS TORMENTING ME.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.665
AND I'D BE FINE--

34:11.650 --> 34:13.606
UM... AHEM...

34:15.480 --> 34:18.984
UNTIL IT HAPPENED AGAIN.
SO NATE CAME UP WITH
ANOTHER STRATEGY.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.682
( chokes )
HE SAID...

34:20.790 --> 34:23.213
"WHEN THEY START IN ON YOU
JUST LAUGH, LAUGH AT THEM.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.925
EVEN IF THEY HIT YOU,
LAUGH."

34:26.030 --> 34:27.679
WELL, I COULD NEVER
PULL THAT OFF.

34:27.790 --> 34:29.451
BUT THAT WAS NATE.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.529
HE COULD LAUGH AT ANYTHING
AND PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS
DRAWN TO HIM,

34:32.630 --> 34:36.191
BECAUSE HE COULD MAKE THE BEST
OF THE WORST SITUATION.

34:44.980 --> 34:47.574
EVEN WHEN LIFE HIT HIM,

34:47.680 --> 34:48.874
IT COULDN'T KI--

34:48.980 --> 34:51.687
KI--

35:03.700 --> 35:05.361
( sighs )

35:21.150 --> 35:23.948
MY NAME IS
GEORGE SIBLEY.

35:24.050 --> 35:26.883
I WAS NATE'S STEPFATHER.

35:26.990 --> 35:29.379
THIS IS A HARD DAY.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.249
AND WE'RE ALL VERY UPSET.

35:38.370 --> 35:44.138
THE LOSS OF A YOUNG PERSON
IS ALWAYS A TERRIBLE BLOW.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.208
BUT IN THIS CASE...

35:46.310 --> 35:48.005
IT-IT'S EVEN MORE CRUEL,

35:48.110 --> 35:51.705
BECAUSE NATE WAS
AN IDEALIST.

35:51.810 --> 35:54.142
AND...

35:54.250 --> 35:56.844
HE STRUGGLED...

35:57.880 --> 35:59.848
ALL THROUGH HIS LIFE...

36:00.920 --> 36:04.014
TO BE A GOOD MAN.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.985
HE WASN'T PERFECT,

36:06.090 --> 36:08.251
BUT THEN
WHO AMONG US IS?

36:08.360 --> 36:10.726
AND HE NEVER GAVE UP
ON HIMSELF...

36:12.330 --> 36:14.469
THE PEOPLE HE LOVED...

36:16.100 --> 36:18.307
OR EVEN LOVE ITSELF,

36:18.410 --> 36:22.198
IN ALL ITS VEXING,
BEAUTIFUL FORMS.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.308
OH, CLAIRE.

36:32.420 --> 36:34.684
THERE'S TOO MUCH COLD CUTS
OUT THERE ALREADY.

36:34.790 --> 36:37.486
HERE, TAKE THIS SCARY
FRUIT CAKE INSTEAD.

36:48.030 --> 36:50.498
HOW'RE YOU FEELING?

36:52.740 --> 36:54.469
OKAY.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.202
I SHOULD GO BACK
DOWNSTAIRS.

36:58.310 --> 37:00.801
IT'S ALL RIGHT
IF YOU NEED TO REST.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.780
YOU CAN GO DOWN
IF YOU WANT.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.415
I WANT TO STAY
WITH YOU.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.623
I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I SAID.

37:19.730 --> 37:21.891
I'M SORRY.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.504
YOU LOST HIM TOO.

37:29.510 --> 37:33.844
YOU AND I ARE REALLY
THE MOST ALIKE, YOU KNOW?

37:35.580 --> 37:37.912
AND SOMETIMES MAYBE...

37:38.020 --> 37:39.840
IT MAKES IT HARD.

37:46.090 --> 37:48.183
HEY.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.222
- HEY.
- HEY.

37:50.330 --> 37:52.264
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- OKAY.

37:52.370 --> 37:55.589
- MANY QUESTIONS.
- UH-OH.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.538
( sighs )

38:01.210 --> 38:02.871
HEY, HONEY.

38:02.980 --> 38:05.778
- HEY.
- DID YOU GO?

38:05.880 --> 38:07.700
NO.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.587
MAYA, WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL SOMEBODY
YOU NEEDED TO GO PO'ITY?

38:13.690 --> 38:16.784
DO I HAVE TO
GET YOU A DIAPER?

38:16.890 --> 38:18.926
GOD, SHE'S BEEN
DOING THIS FOR MONTHS.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.679
SOMETIMES THEY REGRESS
WHEN THEY'RE UPSET.

38:20.790 --> 38:23.850
OH, FUCK!
WE'RE GOING TO THE CEMETERY
IN LIKE TWO MINUTES.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.861
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL CLEAN HER UP.
YOU JUST GO. DON'T WORRY.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.699
- THANKS.
- YUP.

38:35.740 --> 38:38.538
JUST TRYING
TO KEEP THINGS TIDY.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.242
THANK YOU.

38:40.350 --> 38:42.671
WE'RE LEAVING
FOR THE CEMETERY SOON.

38:42.780 --> 38:46.409
- IT'S JUST GOING
TO BE FAMILY.
- I UNDERSTAND.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.115
WOULD YOU CARE
TO JOIN US?

38:50.220 --> 38:53.553
YES. VERY MUCH.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.696
I WOULDN'T WANT
JOY TO COME

38:57.800 --> 39:00.064
IF SHE HAPPENS
TO BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

39:00.170 --> 39:02.092
SHE'S NOT HERE.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.805
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE SHE IS...

39:04.910 --> 39:06.866
EVER...

39:06.970 --> 39:08.870
ANYMORE.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.369
HERE YOU GO.
HEY, CLAIRE.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.414
YOU CAN RIDE
WITH DAVID AND KEITH.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.411
GEORGE IS DRIVING
RUTH, MAGGIE AND SARAH.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.488
HEY, BRENDA, ARE YOU
RIDING WITH YOUR MOM?

39:24.590 --> 39:26.387
UH, NO,
SHE'S NOT GOING.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.424
WELL, YOU CAN RIDE
WITH ME AND NATE.

39:28.530 --> 39:29.997
NO, I'LL DRIVE MYSELF,
THANKS.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.762
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD DO THAT.
THERE'S ROOM WITH DAVID.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.599
- I'M FINE, REALLY.
- OKAY.

39:34.700 --> 39:39.239
WELL, LISTEN,
HERE ARE THE DIRECTIONS
AND MY CELL PHONE

39:39.340 --> 39:41.262
IN CASE YOU GET LOST
OR SOMETHING.

39:41.370 --> 39:43.201
THAN KS.

39:43.310 --> 39:45.505
DON'T FORGET THIS.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.883
( gasps )

40:27.920 --> 40:29.683
GOD DAMN IT!

40:29.790 --> 40:32.429
DAVID,
ARE YOU OKAY?

40:33.790 --> 40:35.326
DAVID?

40:35.430 --> 40:37.318
I CAN'T GO OUT THERE
RIGHT NOW.

40:37.430 --> 40:40.228
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOU GO.

40:40.330 --> 40:41.934
LOOK, I'LL BE OUT ERE
IN A MINUTE.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.168
- I CAN STAY WITH YOU.
- NO, JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE!

40:45.270 --> 40:47.602
OKAY.

40:56.350 --> 40:58.614
THERE'S NO COFFIN?

40:58.720 --> 41:00.642
HE DIDN'T WANT ONE.

41:00.750 --> 41:03.480
IT'S MORE NATURAL
THIS WAY.

41:06.930 --> 41:08.955
WHERE'S DAVID?

41:09.060 --> 41:12.461
I THINK THE THREE OF US
CAN HANDLE THIS.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.673
( groans )
OH, MAN.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.209
WHERE DO WE PUT HIM?

41:38.320 --> 41:41.289
UH, ON THE GROUND,
I GUESS.

41:41.390 --> 41:44.666
WON'T HE GET DIRTY?

41:45.300 --> 41:48.599
DUST TO DUST.

41:56.880 --> 42:01.374
- WASN'T THERE A POEM
HE WANTED READ?
- WHERE'S DAVID?

42:01.480 --> 42:03.971
I THINK HE'S
JUST A LITTLE
TOO UPSET, RUTH.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.412
WE'RE ALL UPSET.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.442
THAT'S RIGHT, SWEETIE.
WE'RE ALL FUCKING UPSET.

42:08.560 --> 42:11.120
SOMETIMES WE CAN'T BE
EVERYWHERE WE WANT TO BE.

42:11.220 --> 42:14.553
YES, WELL,
SOMETIMES WE CAN.

42:25.910 --> 42:27.901
( screams )
OH, GOD!

42:28.010 --> 42:29.534
( panting )

42:29.640 --> 42:31.949
( knocking )

42:35.180 --> 42:37.614
Ruth:
DAVID?

42:43.720 --> 42:47.588
WE'RE STARTING
THE CEREMONY NOW.

42:48.600 --> 42:52.866
I CAN'T.

42:52.970 --> 42:56.690
IF YOU DON'T GET OUT
OF THIS CAR, YOU WILL
HATE YOURSELF FOREVER.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.939
- I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T.
- YES, YOU CAN.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.167
YOU HAVE LEGS.

43:02.640 --> 43:04.870
I AM NOT DOING THIS
WITHOUT YOU.

43:04.980 --> 43:07.574
MOM, PLEASE, I'M SO DIZZY
I CAN'T BREATHE.

43:12.420 --> 43:15.651
WELL, WE'LL WAIT
UNTIL YOU CAN.

43:22.130 --> 43:24.348
( panting )

44:05.040 --> 44:06.632
( sighs )

44:07.510 --> 44:09.375
COULD SOMEONE?

44:33.530 --> 44:38.729
FROM THE "MYSTIC ODES"
OF RUMI.

44:38.840 --> 44:42.879
"OUR DEATH IS
OUR WEDDING WITH ETERNITY.

44:42.980 --> 44:45.369
WHAT IS THE SECRET?

44:45.480 --> 44:47.505
'GOD IS ONE.'

44:47.610 --> 44:51.671
THE SUNLIGHT
SPLITS WHEN ENTERING
THE WINDOWS OF THE HOUSE.

44:51.790 --> 44:55.282
THIS MULTIPLICITY EXISTS
IN THE CLUSTER OF GRAPES;

44:55.390 --> 44:58.723
IT IS NOT IN THE JUICE
MADE FROM THE GRAPES.

44:58.830 --> 45:01.321
FOR HE WHO IS LIVING
IN THE LIGHT OF GOD,

45:01.430 --> 45:05.924
THE DEATH OF THE CARNAL SOUL
IS A BLESSING.

45:06.030 --> 45:09.363
REGARDING HIM SAY
NEITHER BAD NOR GOOD

45:09.470 --> 45:13.634
FOR HE HAS GONE BEYOND
THE GOOD AND THE BAD.

45:13.740 --> 45:19.042
FIX YOUR EYES ON GOD
AND DO NOT TALK ABOUT
WHAT IS INVISIBLE,

45:19.150 --> 45:22.870
SO THAT HE MAY PLACE
ANOTHER LOOK IN YOUR EYES."'

45:22.980 --> 45:26.438
* What else should I be?

45:27.690 --> 45:30.716
* All apologies.

45:30.820 --> 45:32.356
( sniffing )

45:32.460 --> 45:35.429
Young Claire: NATE?

45:36.760 --> 45:38.899
HEY.

45:42.670 --> 45:45.104
KURT COBAIN DIED TODAY.

45:45.210 --> 45:46.802
OH.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.775
HE KILLED HIMSELF.

45:48.880 --> 45:52.270
HE WAS JUST TOO PURE
FOR THIS WORLD.

45:53.280 --> 45:56.511
WELL, HIS MUSIC
WILL LIVE ON.

45:57.650 --> 45:59.117
YEAH.

45:59.220 --> 46:01.518
YEAH, IT WILL.

46:01.620 --> 46:03.087
( sniffles )

46:04.120 --> 46:05.758
( sighs )

46:05.860 --> 46:09.819
- YOU WANNA TRY SOME?
- YEAH.

46:11.500 --> 46:16.039
Sarah:
"IT IS THE ETERNAL LIGHT
WHICH IS THE LIGHT OF GOD.

46:16.140 --> 46:19.359
THE EPHEMERAL LIGHT IS
AN A'ITRIBUTE OF THE BODY

46:19.470 --> 46:21.870
AND THE FLESH.

46:21.980 --> 46:27.202
...OH GOD,
WHO GIVES THE GRACE
OF VISION.

46:27.310 --> 46:31.679
THE BIRD OF VISION IS
FLYING TOWARD YOU

46:31.780 --> 46:35.352
WITH THE WINGS
OF DESIRE."

46:39.560 --> 46:41.528
( somber music playing )

46:55.010 --> 46:57.535
Rico:
ONE, TWO...

46:57.640 --> 47:00.939
OH, SHIT!
SORRY.

47:06.090 --> 47:08.479
Rico:
THANKS,
CLAIRE.

47:15.030 --> 47:17.248
ONE, TWO, THREE.
EASY.

47:19.870 --> 47:21.667
EASY.

47:21.770 --> 47:23.328
OKAY.

49:24.620 --> 49:26.622
( engine choking )

49:32.370 --> 49:35.897
Nate:
DID YOU LIKE
THE POEM I CHOSE?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.560
NO, I HATED IT.
MYSTICAL MAUDLIN CRAP.

49:38.670 --> 49:40.831
YOU JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

49:40.940 --> 49:44.068
I'M ABOUT 20 TIMES
SMARTER THAN YOU.
I UNDERSTOOD IT.

49:44.180 --> 49:45.807
IT'S NOT ABOUT
BEING SMART, BRENDA.

49:45.910 --> 49:48.401
IT'S ABOUT HAVING
SPIRITUAL DEPTH.
MAGGIE UNDERSTOOD IT.

49:48.510 --> 49:51.115
MAGGIE'S A MEALY-MOUTHED
LI'ITLE CUNT.

49:51.220 --> 49:53.108
SHE COULDN'T EVEN ADMIT
SHE FUCKED YOU!

49:53.220 --> 49:55.381
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANNA
POLLUTE WHAT SHE AND I SHARED

49:55.490 --> 49:57.253
BY HANDING IT OVER
TO YOUR FILTHY IMAGINATION--

49:57.360 --> 50:00.124
WHAT YOU SHARED?
ADULTERY WHILE YOUR
WIFE'S PREGNANT

50:00.230 --> 50:02.050
AND RAISING YOUR CHILD
FROM ANOTHER WOMAN?

50:02.160 --> 50:05.061
YOU WILL ALWAYS THINK
OF MAYA THAT WAY, WON'T YOU?

50:05.170 --> 50:07.195
EVEN WHEN SHE'S CALLING
YOU MOMMY YOU THINK,

50:07.300 --> 50:08.961
"I'M STUCK RAISING
SOME DEAD BITCH'S KID."

50:09.070 --> 50:10.799
NO, I'M A GOOD MOTHER
TO HER.

50:10.900 --> 50:13.698
YOU WERE A GREAT MOTHER
WHEN YOU YELLED AT HER
FOR HAVING AN ACCIDENT.

50:13.810 --> 50:15.300
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO YELL AT HER.

50:15.410 --> 50:17.731
YOU JUST WANTED ME TO PLUG
YOU WITH YOUR OWN BABY,

50:17.840 --> 50:19.068
AND NOW YOU'VE GOT THAT.

50:19.180 --> 50:20.772
SO YOU CAN DROP THE
WRONGED-LI'ITLE-WIFE ROUTINE.

50:20.880 --> 50:23.348
- WHY ARE YOU SAYING THIS?
- YOU COULD'VE MARRIED JOE

50:23.450 --> 50:25.589
IF YOU WANTED
TO BE WITH SOMEBODY
WHO WANTED TO BE WITH YOU.

50:25.690 --> 50:28.545
BUT DEEP DOWN,
YOU KNOW THAT ANYBODY
WHO WANTS TO BE WITH YOU

50:28.650 --> 50:30.288
- IS A FUCKING IDIOT.
- SHUT UP!

50:30.390 --> 50:32.756
BECAUSE JUST
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
IN YOUR PSYCHOTIC FAMILY

50:32.860 --> 50:35.021
YOU HAVE TO DESTROY EVERYTHING
AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE!

50:35.130 --> 50:36.995
PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE!

50:37.100 --> 50:40.319
OKAY, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

50:46.110 --> 50:47.998
WE BROUGHT YOU
SOME ALPHABET SOUP.

50:48.110 --> 50:50.408
IT WAS ALL WE HAD.

50:50.510 --> 50:53.877
( David sighs )
OH, THANK YOU.

50:53.980 --> 50:58.610
I EVEN LOADED SOME
SMOOTH JAZZ ONTO MY iPOD
FOR YOU TO LISTEN TO.

50:58.720 --> 51:00.381
WOW, THANKS.

51:00.490 --> 51:03.755
I HAD NO IDEA YOU GUYS
WERE SUCH GOOD NURSES.

51:04.890 --> 51:06.778
YEAH, WELL.

51:06.890 --> 51:08.778
YOU LEARN SOMETHING
NEW EVERY DAY.

51:08.890 --> 51:11.450
( Keith shouting )
I'M GONNA COME OVER THERE
AND DESTROY YOU!

51:11.560 --> 51:13.369
YEAH, YOU DO.

51:13.470 --> 51:15.791
I DON'T CARE WHERE
THEY FOUND HIM, ROGER!
OKAY, I QUIT!

51:15.900 --> 51:17.788
UH-OH.

51:17.900 --> 51:19.436
NO! YOU ARE
ONE SICK DUDE!

51:19.540 --> 51:22.031
I DON'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE
NEAR YOU EVER AGAIN!

51:22.140 --> 51:24.608
HE'S NOT GONNA TAKE
THE iPODS AWAY, IS HE?

51:24.710 --> 51:27.941
- I'M SERIOUS, ROGER!
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!
- I HOPE NOT.

51:28.050 --> 51:30.041
I NEED MY SMOOTH JAZZ.

51:30.150 --> 51:32.539
YOU BE'ITER EAT THAT
WHILE IT'S HOT.

51:36.020 --> 51:39.922
I FORGET HOW ANYONE
GETS OVER ANYTHING.

51:40.030 --> 51:42.021
YOU DON'T
REALLY.

51:42.130 --> 51:44.496
DON'T SAY THAT.
YOU DO.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.227
IT'S JUST TIME.

51:46.330 --> 51:49.163
AND REMEMBERING LOVE,
REALLY.

51:49.270 --> 51:51.090
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

51:51.200 --> 51:54.408
SLOWLY YOU
FALL BACK IN LOVE

51:54.510 --> 51:57.832
WITH WHATEVER
REALLY MA'ITERED TO YOU.

51:57.940 --> 52:03.242
YES, AND MAYBE
YOU FIND A WAY

52:03.350 --> 52:06.046
TO MAKE SENSE
OF WHAT YOU'VE LOST.

52:06.150 --> 52:09.483
THAT DOESN'T
SEEM POSSIBLE.

52:12.730 --> 52:14.425
HONEY...

52:15.530 --> 52:18.499
I DON'T WANT
TO FREAK YOU OUT...

52:19.730 --> 52:22.233
BUT LAST NIGHT...

52:22.340 --> 52:25.434
UH, NATE APPEARED TO ME
IN A DREAM.

52:25.540 --> 52:26.939
HE DID?

52:27.040 --> 52:30.237
- MM.
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

52:31.380 --> 52:34.144
HE DIDN'T REALLY
SAY ANYTHING.

52:34.250 --> 52:38.243
BUT HE HAD
A VERY LOVING PRESENCE.

52:38.350 --> 52:40.409
WAS HE WITH SOMEONE?

52:40.520 --> 52:42.454
HE-HE WAS WITH ME,
I GUESS.

52:42.560 --> 52:46.758
ARE YOU SURE HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT DEATH?

52:46.860 --> 52:49.954
WELL, HE DIDN'T HAVE
TO SAY IT, SWEETIE.

52:50.060 --> 52:52.494
I GOT THE MESSAGE.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.522
( sighs )

52:55.800 --> 52:57.859
( doorbell rings )

53:02.410 --> 53:05.174
( door opens )

53:09.750 --> 53:11.217
OH.

53:11.320 --> 53:13.686
HELLO, DEAR.

53:15.590 --> 53:18.081
- GRANDMA!
- ( chuckles )

53:18.190 --> 53:20.226
OH, THANK YOU.

53:21.060 --> 53:23.494
COME UPSTAIRS, DEAR.

53:25.370 --> 53:27.861
I CAN'T DO THIS
RIGHT NOW.

53:27.970 --> 53:31.531
I NEED YOU TO TAKE HER FOR--
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.

53:31.640 --> 53:34.165
- OF COURSE.
- PLUS, I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THINGS

53:34.270 --> 53:36.932
WORSE FOR HER IF I CAN.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.941
I CAN'T DO--

53:46.850 --> 53:49.512
MAYA,

53:49.620 --> 53:53.249
YOU STAY WITH GRANDMA, OKAY?

53:53.360 --> 53:57.524
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN WITH GRANDMA.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.760
( whispers )
I LOVE YOU.

54:11.980 --> 54:13.971
( door shuts )

54:39.140 --> 54:40.607
( door slams open )

54:40.710 --> 54:43.770
( footsteps
approaching )

54:48.710 --> 54:51.019
- IT'S JUST ME.
- ( gasps ) FUCK!

54:51.120 --> 54:53.315
OH, JESUS, BILLY!

54:53.420 --> 54:56.583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

54:56.690 --> 54:59.989
I TRIED TO MAKE IT BACK
IN TIME FOR THE FUNERAL.

55:00.090 --> 55:02.558
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL?

55:04.300 --> 55:07.599
I THOUGHT IT WAS BE'ITER
TO JUST GET HERE.

55:10.940 --> 55:13.158
OH, GOD.

55:13.270 --> 55:15.636
( weeping )

55:25.850 --> 55:27.545
( "All Apologies"
Playing )

55:27.650 --> 55:31.518
* ALL IN ALL

55:31.620 --> 55:36.057
