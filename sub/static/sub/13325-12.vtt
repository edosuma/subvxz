WEBVTT

00:06.172 --> 00:07.773
( bottles rattle )

00:11.378 --> 00:12.544
It's all
your fault, charlie!

00:12.546 --> 00:15.180
I wish I'd never met you!

00:15.182 --> 00:18.450
- I'm sorry, lindsay.
- No-- god.

00:26.393 --> 00:28.794
I guess I'm just worried
that robots will take over

00:28.796 --> 00:32.531
Because they think humans
are a bunch of easily
distracted idiots.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.533
And why don't you
ever have donuts?

00:34.535 --> 00:37.436
Yeah, let's get
some donuts in here.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.671
You're not here for donuts.
You're here to get help
with your anger.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.708
Seriously, charlie,
get some of those little
powdered ones.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.443
I love to lick
the powder off

00:44.445 --> 00:47.212
And then give the rest
to the homeless.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.415
Well, remember
you're modeling my dress
at design school next week

00:49.417 --> 00:51.817
And right now,
you fit into it perfectly,

00:51.819 --> 00:53.786
<i>So you can't</i>
<i>gain an ounce.</i>

00:53.788 --> 00:55.421
The only thing
you're allowed to do

00:55.423 --> 00:57.556
Is lick some homeless
guy's donut.

01:01.161 --> 01:03.562
Okay, for the love of god,
would somebody please
say something

01:03.564 --> 01:07.199
That will take our minds off
of what we're all thinking?

01:07.201 --> 01:10.135
I will.
According to tmz,

01:10.137 --> 01:12.471
Lindsay lohan's gonna have
an anger management therapist

01:12.473 --> 01:14.540
On the set
of her new commercial.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.508
Apparently, they're afraid
she's gonna lose it.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.578
What in the hell
is the matter with all these
stupid celebrities

01:19.580 --> 01:21.680
Who can't control
themselves?

01:21.682 --> 01:24.583
Why are you yelling at me?
How the hell would I know?

01:26.086 --> 01:29.288
Yeah, charlie only deals
with regular people.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.557
For movie stars,
they bring in super
qualified guys

01:31.559 --> 01:34.426
Who    <i>real</i>know
what they're doing.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.527
Hey, hey, hey.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.663
I am qualified
to treat anybody.

01:37.665 --> 01:40.232
I just can't always
tell you guys who all
my patients are.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.668
And for the record,
I think it would be healthy
for lindsay to have me--

01:42.670 --> 01:44.670
I mean,
somebody like me--

01:44.672 --> 01:47.506
Who am I kidding?
It's me.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.842
Oh, my god!
You're gonna be lindsay
lohan's therapist?

01:49.844 --> 01:52.578
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

01:52.580 --> 01:56.248
- You're a disgrace.
- Charlie: <i>Okay, look, look.</i>

01:56.250 --> 01:58.650
Lindsay's doing this
big japanese commercial
and her people contacted me

01:58.652 --> 02:01.253
About being there for her
in case she needs my help.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.489
Now I'm asking you all to be
very discreet about this.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.358
And send.

02:07.327 --> 02:10.195
I'm sorry,
what were you saying?

02:10.197 --> 02:12.264
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

02:14.200 --> 02:15.834
Hi.
I'm lindsay lohan.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.904
And I love
the taste of alcohol.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.573
But sometimes bars close.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.845
So how am I gonna get
that taste until they're
open again?

02:26.847 --> 02:29.481
<i>( upbeat music playing )</i>

02:29.483 --> 02:30.849
Thank you, booze bear.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.152
#1 happy whiskey chew.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.521
Man:
<i>Yes, chewing!</i>

02:35.523 --> 02:38.157
There's no alcohol in it,
so I won't get drunk.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.926
But I still might wake up
with a stranger.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.365
Now I'm having sex
with a bear?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.634
Are you kidding me?
-- Really?!

02:48.636 --> 02:50.536
Cut.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.541
What's wrong here?
We're gonna fall
behind schedule.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.276
- Would you give us
a second, please?
- Fine.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.944
But if she's not back
on set in five minutes

02:58.946 --> 03:01.547
Doing exactly what's
on these pages, she's in
breach of contract.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.283
Sure, we wouldn't want to
jeopardize the good name

03:04.285 --> 03:08.187
And artistic vision of
#1 happy whiskey chew.

03:12.225 --> 03:14.493
Look, I know
you're probably gonna
think I'm some whiney,

03:14.495 --> 03:16.762
Spoiled actress,
but they changed
the script on me.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.798
So they added that
super creepy bear
with the antlers?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.568
Because that's pure
nightmare stuff right there.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.204
All I agreed to
do was dress up like
a japanese schoolgirl

03:25.206 --> 03:28.340
And now I'm some drunk
who has sex with bears
for gum.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.476
- Are we ready?
- No.

03:31.478 --> 03:34.413
This is humiliating
and insulting and I don't
wanna do it.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.649
Hey, goodson, I thought
it was supposed to be your
job to make her happy?

03:37.651 --> 03:39.685
Okay.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.520
Then this should
make her happy,

03:41.522 --> 03:43.455
I agree with her.
She's right.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.591
You lied to her.
Her anger is totally
justified.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.693
You lied to her
and you're exploiting
her to sell gum.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.761
Which, by the way,
I tasted...

03:49.763 --> 03:52.631
And I think is about
the greatest thing ever.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.467
That being said, still,
if I were her, I'd--

03:55.469 --> 03:57.903
Sorry, I'd tell you
to go to hell.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.005
I like you.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.673
Go to hell.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.544
No, no, no, no.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.446
I said if I were you.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.514
You are you. I think
we should take a minute
and think this through.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.483
No, no, no.
This feels right.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.685
You know,
when they hired you,
I was kind of upset.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.654
But I think
you're exactly
what I need.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.589
An enabler?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.725
No, you seem like
a good, normal guy.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.960
Not one of those
hollywood party boys.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.396
Douchebags.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.298
- I hate those guys.
- Yeah.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.699
You know what, charlie?

04:27.701 --> 04:29.801
I'm trying to break
my old, destructive habits

04:29.803 --> 04:32.671
And I think you're
just the guy to help me.

04:32.673 --> 04:36.275
( panting )

04:36.277 --> 04:38.577
That must have been
pretty exciting for you.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.746
Considering
who I am and all.

04:42.582 --> 04:45.550
No, seriously,
I never thought I'd sleep
with a movie star.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.386
Yeah.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.722
And I never thought
I'd be sleeping with
a therapist from the valley.

04:52.325 --> 04:54.026
I think we're saying
two different things.

04:54.028 --> 04:56.361
Yeah, I think we are.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.667
Hey, charlie.

05:01.669 --> 05:05.404
I brought over
some more empty bottles
for sam's recycling project.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.606
- These are from last night.
- <i>Wow.</i>

05:07.608 --> 05:10.642
Somebody's got really serious
about his alcoholism.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.412
Oh, no.
Those are from my book
club for single moms.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.080
That thing's finally
paying off.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.015
You remember that woman
I told you about?

05:17.017 --> 05:19.918
Two kids,
sells power tools
at sears.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.020
- The one
with the big feet?
- Yup.

05:22.022 --> 05:25.857
Well, those giant flippers
were up in the air last night

05:25.859 --> 05:28.727
Waving like palm trees
in the wind.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.396
- Hi, charlie.
- Hi, sweetie.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.466
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.502
- Hi.
- Hello.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.644
- Tell me more
about sears girl.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:48.915 --> 05:50.582
That was lindsay lohan.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.951
Did you know
she was here?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.886
Yes, but don't
be jealous.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.889
This doesn't take anything
away from your sasquatch
girl from book club.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.425
Are these
lindsay lohan's
sunglasses?

06:00.427 --> 06:02.928
- Can I have 'em?
- No, no.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.764
She needs these
to hide in public.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.100
Why? 'cause she's
dating you?

06:09.936 --> 06:13.405
We're not dating.
I mean, I like her,
but who knows?

06:13.407 --> 06:14.940
It'll never work out.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.441
Celebrities
and regular people
don't mix.

06:16.443 --> 06:20.011
Let me tell you
something I learned about
celebrities last night.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.913
They're just like
regular people.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.516
They take my pants off
one leg at a time.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.390
God, it's so peaceful here.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.091
How 'bout we just
stay in bed all day?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.861
I would, but I have
to go to prison.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.530
- For how long?
- About an hour.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.500
Wow. You have
a great lawyer.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.973
No, no, no. I have
an anger therapy group there.
We meet once a week.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.041
Could I--
could I maybe
come with you?

06:50.043 --> 06:52.911
Because, you know,
I still have community
service left to do

06:52.913 --> 06:56.148
And speaking at a prison
would definitely knock
off an hour or two.

06:56.150 --> 06:59.151
Well, I could call them
and see if it's all right
if I bring you. Sure.

06:59.153 --> 07:00.552
I don't think
it should be a problem.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.855
They know me at all
the prisons and jails.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.591
You don't know how long
I've waited for a girl
to say that.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.631
So what I've learned is,
if you just take the time

07:12.633 --> 07:14.433
To think before you speak,

07:14.435 --> 07:16.601
It can really improve
your life.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.774
I'm not a cannibal,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.509
That's not why
I'm in here,

07:24.511 --> 07:27.012
But I bet you'd taste
like raspberries.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.550
Um, thank you.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.888
You see, wayne,
that's exactly
the opposite

07:36.890 --> 07:39.124
Of what she was saying
about thinking before
you speak.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.792
Oh, I thought about it.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.561
I've been thinking about it
ever since she sat

07:42.563 --> 07:45.096
Her sweet little raspberry
body in that chair.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.567
Sorry, that one
I did not think about.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.070
Anybody have any
appropriate questions
about what they've heard?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.738
Oh, yes.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.974
First of all,
miss lohan,

07:55.976 --> 07:58.677
I've seen "freaky Friday,"
like, 400,000 times.

07:58.679 --> 08:02.247
- Let's just get that
off the table.
- Thank you.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.715
And, second of all,

08:03.717 --> 08:05.217
How do you get
your eyes like that?

08:05.219 --> 08:07.018
They always look
so twinkly and cute.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.621
Even when you
draggin' ass.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.524
Oh, I use
this eyeliner pen.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.125
Oh, I can't get
eyeliner in here.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.995
You got any tips
on using cockroach dust
and toilet water?

08:16.997 --> 08:21.533
Okay, I think lindsay
has to go now, guys.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.536
All right,
thank you, guys.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.204
Oh, and by the way,
if anybody asks,

08:26.206 --> 08:28.240
I was here
for the full hour.

08:30.643 --> 08:33.645
Charlie, I think I speak
for the entire group

08:33.647 --> 08:36.147
When I say that
we would all like
to say some

08:36.149 --> 08:38.550
Very dirty things
about miss lohan.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.521
But we will
refrain from that
if you are currently--

08:42.523 --> 08:45.056
How can I put this
delicately--

08:46.692 --> 08:47.959
Jammin' her.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.096
Thank you
for the courtesy, donovan,

08:51.098 --> 08:53.131
And, yes,
there's definitely
an attraction.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.133
I just don't know
if I'm ready to pursue it.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.136
I barely know her
and I'm just not that sure

08:58.138 --> 09:01.139
If celebrities
and regular people
mix all that well.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.242
Is it because of
all the things the press
says about lindsay?

09:04.244 --> 09:06.044
You can't believe
everything you read.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.713
They said I stabbed a guy,
like, 100 times.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.983
I stabbed him
maybe 50 at the most.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.818
Liars.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.321
The newspapers
accused me of assault
with a deadly weapon.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.324
It wasn't deadly.
I missed.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.929
Charlie, sorry to
interrupt, everyone.

09:23.931 --> 09:27.732
Found out about
what happened on
the commercial yesterday.

09:29.936 --> 09:33.305
"svengali shrink out
to destroy lilo's career."

09:34.574 --> 09:36.141
I bet it was that panda.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.109
I told you
he was a nightmare.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.349
- Is your family here yet?
- They're on their way.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.652
Great. See, this is
exactly what I need.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.654
Sitting around
with normal people,

09:49.656 --> 09:52.023
Having a normal dinner,
living a normal life.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.224
<i>( cell phone chimes )</i>

09:53.226 --> 09:54.993
Oh, my god.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.996
Bergiere's letting me borrow
their $20,000 dress tomorrow.

09:57.998 --> 10:01.933
Big lots is letting me
wear their four-dollar
socks I bought there.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.172
Seriously, it's a big
charity event tomorrow night.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.840
Do you wanna come?

10:08.842 --> 10:12.010
Maybe at the end
of the night, I'll let
you take off my dress.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.279
And then maybe
I'll let you, lindsay lohan,

10:14.281 --> 10:16.381
Take off my socks.

10:18.184 --> 10:20.185
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>
<i>- okay, they're here.</i>

10:20.187 --> 10:23.088
- Just give me a minute
to freshen up.
- You got it.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.859
- Hey.
- Hey, dad.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.662
- Is she here yet?
- She'll be down
in a minute.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.297
Hello, charlie.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.237
I know that tone.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.740
That's the
"I don't approve of
charlie's hot new

10:41.742 --> 10:43.408
Movie star
girlfriend" tone.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.343
It's not that.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.380
I know things about her.
I read, charlie.

10:48.382 --> 10:51.316
"us weekly," "star,"
"the enquirer," "people."

10:51.318 --> 10:54.219
Every once in a while,
you might want to
mix in a book.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.188
Hey, the "100 sexiest people"
issue is like this thick.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.857
It's almost like a book.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.026
Just give her a chance.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.161
The girl is trouble.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.929
It's gonna embarrass sam

11:04.931 --> 11:06.398
And I don't want
our daughter to suffer

11:06.400 --> 11:08.800
The negative consequences
of your actions.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.435
Negative consequences?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.437
Yesterday,
nobody knew my name.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.139
Now I'm that
weird short girl

11:14.141 --> 11:16.374
Whose dad is dating
lindsay lohan.
Thanks, dad.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.145
You hear that?
And just remember, jen,

11:20.147 --> 11:22.180
When you and I
first started dating,
you had a reputation, too.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.182
Because I was sleeping
with you!

11:25.384 --> 11:27.318
Well, I didn't judge you.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.159
Do you know her history?
She parties too much.

11:34.161 --> 11:37.328
She gets into fights.
The woman has stolen things.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.264
We don't know
what's true and what isn't.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.399
I heard a story
about a guy who stabbed
somebody 100 times.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.268
Turns out
it was only 50.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.270
Now everybody's afraid
of that guy.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.439
You're just being
seduced by the fact

11:47.441 --> 11:50.275
That she's a celebrity
and that's sad and shallow.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.744
- Hey, everybody.
- Oh, my god.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.379
You're even prettier
in person.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.382
I'm so sad
and shallow.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.351
Lindsay,
this is my daughter sam
and her mother jennifer.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.987
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Will you take a picture
with me?

12:02.989 --> 12:05.924
I need to prove you were
here so everyone at school
will keep talking to me.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.927
- Oh, sure.
- Would you mind signing
an autograph

12:08.929 --> 12:11.162
- On a napkin or something
for me, please?
- Um, sure.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.165
- Yeah, there's a pen
in my purse.
- Oh, okay.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.435
Wow. My god,
I'm putting my hand into
lindsay lohan's purse.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.438
And now I'm pulling out
my daughter's sunglasses.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.308
- How did those get in there?
- That was me, jen.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.077
I saw them on the counter,
I thought they were lindsay's,
so I put them in her purse.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.412
Mm-hmm.
That must be it.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.047
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
It is it.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.315
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

12:30.317 --> 12:33.184
Just so you both know,
I speak "mm-hmm," too,

12:33.186 --> 12:35.954
And I didn't steal
anybody's sunglasses.

12:35.956 --> 12:39.224
Come on, sam.
We should leave.

12:39.226 --> 12:42.994
Thank you so much
for stealing my sunglasses.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.764
Best day ever!

12:45.766 --> 12:47.532
Before you say anything,

12:47.534 --> 12:49.467
You should know
that my ex-wife thinks

12:49.469 --> 12:52.103
That all my girlfriends
are thieves, so it's cool.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.839
No, it's not.
I really wanted
your family to like me.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.941
Oh, that's so sweet.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.078
You know what?
I think someone
just stole my heart.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.213
Too soon?

13:03.115 --> 13:05.283
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>
<i>- coming.</i>

13:08.354 --> 13:10.388
( crying )
he broke up with me.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.123
- Who?
- Ryan.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.959
He was supposed
to break up with his wife.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.463
Okay, I know
you're going through
a lot right now

13:18.465 --> 13:20.498
And I'm really glad
you came,

13:20.500 --> 13:22.100
But we need to get
this dress on you,

13:22.102 --> 13:24.402
Sweetheart, okay?
Take off your clothes.

13:24.404 --> 13:28.106
That's the second to the last
thing he ever said to me.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.175
I understand.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.076
Come on.
I'll help.

13:34.446 --> 13:36.948
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling ryan.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.019
Hello?

13:41.021 --> 13:44.122
Who is this?
Oh, hi, tyler.

13:44.124 --> 13:47.225
Can I talk to your daddy?

13:47.227 --> 13:49.561
You don't wanna do that.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.429
Shut up!

13:51.431 --> 13:53.298
Oh, okay.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.233
Well, when he gets back,
will you tell him

13:55.235 --> 13:58.303
That he's a piece of garbage
and he deserves your mommy?

14:01.473 --> 14:03.074
Thank you, honey.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.213
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.948
But we don't have
a lot of time,

14:09.950 --> 14:12.450
- So let's get you into this.
- ( wailing )

14:12.452 --> 14:15.186
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.355
Come on.
All right.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.462
You ate!

14:24.464 --> 14:27.966
Of course I ate!
Weren't you listening
to me? I got dumped!

14:27.968 --> 14:29.601
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
oh, my god, oh, my god.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.536
- What did you eat?!
- I had pie!

14:31.538 --> 14:33.872
- How many pieces?!
- I don't know!

14:33.874 --> 14:36.007
How many pieces
are in a pie?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.644
All right,
I can fix this.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.412
I'm gonna have to touch
your butt now.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.249
That's how ryan
and I met.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.619
Okay.
All right.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.554
All right,
just arch your back.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.456
The clasp has
gotta get-- okay.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.258
Now, I'm just
gonna get the zipper.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.893
( grunts )

14:54.895 --> 14:57.962
- It's never gonna zip.
- You know what?

14:57.964 --> 14:59.330
It doesn't matter.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.966
What happened to you
is what matters.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.569
You are special
and beautiful.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.438
We have to get you
to stop crying.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.342
All right,
now just take
a deep breath.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.446
Thank you, patrick.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.248
See, you're feeling
better already.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.318
Now just take
another breath...
Even deeper.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.021
Now!

15:26.325 --> 15:27.926
It's crushing my ribs.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.494
Do you like it?

15:30.629 --> 15:33.031
I feel so pretty.

15:35.634 --> 15:39.003
Charlie, thank you
so much for making me
go to the grocery store.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.172
I love to go,
but I'm just always worried

15:41.174 --> 15:43.508
The paparazzi
are gonna mob me.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.544
Nothing bad's gonna happen
as long as you're with me.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.413
<i>( cell phone chimes )</i>

15:48.415 --> 15:50.982
What?

15:50.984 --> 15:55.086
"lilo steals sunglasses
from mentally disturbed
high school student"?

15:56.355 --> 15:58.423
I can't believe they can
just lie like that.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.358
She's not mentally disturbed,
she just has ocd.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.360
Oh, really?
And I didn't
steal anything.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.996
Oh, yeah.
That, too.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.100
Charlie, do you really
think it's a good idea
that we're dating?

16:09.102 --> 16:11.736
Are you kidding me?
We're having a fantastic time.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.705
Look, we just went
grocery shopping.

16:13.707 --> 16:16.674
Yeah, I mean,
I guess that is one
of the most normal things

16:16.676 --> 16:19.110
I've done since I was
in "parent trap."

16:19.112 --> 16:21.045
You want normal?
I can line it up.

16:21.047 --> 16:24.015
There's a post office,
dry cleaner, jiffy lube.

16:24.017 --> 16:28.119
You're about to go on
the most ordinary ride
of your life.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.988
That does sound
pretty good.

16:29.990 --> 16:33.257
Good? It's great.
I mean, look at these.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.094
Powdered donuts.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.363
Oh, they do look
really good.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.232
Close your eyes.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.468
- Charlie.
- Close 'em.

16:45.137 --> 16:48.006
( laughs )

16:48.008 --> 16:50.375
Oh, great.
Thank you.

16:50.377 --> 16:53.044
Thank you.
It really brings out
my eyes, doesn't it?

16:53.046 --> 16:54.679
- Yeah, it brings out
your nose, actually.
- Thank you.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.647
It's really good.

16:56.649 --> 17:00.151
What do you say we take
this box of donuts upstairs
and see what happens?

17:07.126 --> 17:08.793
<i>( music playing )</i>

17:08.795 --> 17:10.628
Announcer:
<i>Coming up next...</i>

17:10.630 --> 17:13.331
<i>Lindsay lohan caught</i>
<i>in coke-fueled sex romp.</i>

17:17.336 --> 17:19.570
Next time,
I'll buy chocolate.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.776
- I got bad news.
- Don't tell me...

17:24.778 --> 17:26.477
The place is surrounded
by paparazzi.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.312
I think I should go out
there and talk to them.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.681
No, no, no.
You have to have a pr
person write a statement.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.818
That way
if something goes bad,
you have someone to fire.

17:33.820 --> 17:37.188
If it was me,
I would just give people
uncensored honesty.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.757
I think you just gotta lose
the filter and say whatever
pops in your head.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.326
What's the worst
that could happen?

17:42.328 --> 17:46.497
And get to the charity event
'cause they're counting on me.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.632
I promise, I will figure out
a way to get you there.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.500
I am so sorry
about all this.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.202
Charlie, if there's
one thing you should know,

17:51.204 --> 17:53.438
It's when a guy apologizes
to me, it's a real turnoff.

17:53.440 --> 17:57.108
Oh, you mean like
when I just said I was sorry?
That was not an apology.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.544
That was me saying
I'm sorry, but you ain't
gettin' no apology.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.483
My god. There's a ton
of people with cameras
out there.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.419
It's like
a japanese best buy.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.822
That's why I called lacey.
I need her help.

18:10.824 --> 18:13.157
I didn't know
you were all going to
patrick's fashion show,

18:13.159 --> 18:14.725
But good job
for supporting him
like that.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.394
Charlie, you have
to hear this story.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.663
So we finally get to my show
at the design school.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.465
Can you make
a long story short?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.800
I lost to a jumpsuit.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.369
Charlie:
<i>Hey, lindsay.</i>

18:25.371 --> 18:28.439
Lacey, patrick, ed, nolan.
Guys, this is lindsay.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.341
- Hi.
- Lindsay lohan, right?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.510
- Yes, I am, sir.
- Nice to meet you.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.646
- You, too.
- You're the problem
with america.

18:35.648 --> 18:39.350
Thank you.
I get that a lot.

18:41.487 --> 18:44.355
Don't listen to him.
He tells me the same
thing every day.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.158
Which means you and I
are like soul mates.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.494
- Can we be besties?
- Probably not.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.529
Yeah, I thought so, too.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.898
We're so much alike.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.367
I hope so because I'm gonna
need you to go out there

18:56.369 --> 18:58.603
And pretend to be lindsay.
Here, put this on.

18:58.605 --> 19:02.306
All she has to do is
drive away, the paparazzi
will follow her,

19:02.308 --> 19:06.244
Wait, so, seriously,
this is your plan?
This is what you're doing?

19:06.246 --> 19:08.412
It's gonna be fine.

19:08.414 --> 19:11.449
- Lacey, can you handle this?
- Hell, yeah.

19:11.451 --> 19:15.353
- As soon as
you pull away, we go.
- I got this.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.565
Wow, look at 'em
pushing and shoving.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.501
This is gonna test all her
anger management skills.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.903
Wait, she's in
your group?

19:31.905 --> 19:34.639
Yeah.
We all are.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.507
So you're saying that
you sent someone

19:36.509 --> 19:39.510
With anger issues
into a crowd of
paparazzi as me?

19:39.512 --> 19:42.513
Kind of.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.715
She's been in
therapy for a long time.
She's doing great.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.951
- Oh, god.
- Ed: She's coming back.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.920
Screw you!

19:48.922 --> 19:51.289
I don't take crap
from no one.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.790
I'm lindsay
freakin' lohan.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.459
Don't worry,
I'm protecting your rep.

19:55.461 --> 19:59.497
Take a picture of this,
you filthy animals!

19:59.499 --> 20:01.465
Whoo!

20:01.467 --> 20:03.668
Whoo!
We did it!

20:03.670 --> 20:07.805
Yeah! Everyone thinks
I'm lindsay lohan.

20:07.807 --> 20:11.609
But I couldn't
get to the car,
so now what do we do?

20:11.611 --> 20:14.679
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.648
Lindsay, I am so sorry.
I mean, no, I'm not sorry.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.318
I'm just gonna have to
go out there and face them.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.353
Well, you don't have
to face them alone.
I'm here for you.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.524
Hold on, hold on.
You got a little thread
right here.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.659
Let me just
get that for you.

20:35.701 --> 20:39.403
So is it supposed
to do that?

20:40.639 --> 20:42.473
Lindsay, uh...

20:42.475 --> 20:43.708
I-- I'm sorry.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.310
No.

20:46.312 --> 20:49.780
Don't move, don't talk,
and don't touch.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.649
<i>( beads clatter )</i>

20:54.720 --> 20:56.854
You're a nice guy,
but you're destroying
my life.

20:56.856 --> 21:00.858
So am I going to
the event with you or not?

21:00.860 --> 21:03.861
'cause I rented this tux.
I'm out, like, 80 bucks.

21:08.634 --> 21:10.468
Right.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.336
Okay, let's get
you out of here.
You can take my car.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.639
Ed, call the cops
on the paparazzi.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.741
Patrick, can lindsay
borrow your dress?

21:16.743 --> 21:19.610
Lindsay lohan
wearing my dress?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.912
You heard him, tubby,
take it off.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.917
I really wish things
had worked out differently.

21:26.919 --> 21:30.755
- We tried.
- If you ever need
anything, call me.

21:30.757 --> 21:34.058
Yeah, I already deleted
you from my phone.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.593
Smart.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.495
Sorry about the mess
in the backseat.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.963
It's my kid's
recycling project.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.465
All right,
you better get going.
You're going to be late.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.734
- <i>( car starts )</i>
<i>- you're all clear.</i>

21:46.738 --> 21:49.006
<i>( tires screech, crashes )</i>

21:49.008 --> 21:50.474
<i>( police siren blares )</i>

21:50.476 --> 21:53.344
Oh, look,
the cops are here.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.651
( bottles rattle )

22:00.653 --> 22:03.521
I can't believe
lindsay lohan

22:03.523 --> 22:05.589
Got arrested
wearing my dress.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.825
Best day ever.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.827
Thank you so much,
charlie.

22:10.862 --> 22:14.031
Well, I like
to help people.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.800
That's what I do.
