00:00.461 --> 00:03.584
When I was your age, I had to spend
the night in a hospital too.

00:03.609 --> 00:05.126
Lots of times, actually.

00:05.151 --> 00:09.311
<i>It's difficult when you come
home for such a short time.</i>

00:09.379 --> 00:11.413
I know it's hard. But we're here now.

00:11.438 --> 00:13.359
You should make the most of it.

00:43.057 --> 00:44.657
I can't accept this.

00:44.682 --> 00:46.816
It's a gift for Eid, tradition.

00:46.966 --> 00:49.237
Okay? How's the place?

00:49.314 --> 00:50.666
It's fine.

00:50.839 --> 00:53.565
I don't have much
privacy, but it's a bed.

00:54.330 --> 00:56.370
You haven't heard from
the police again I hope?

00:56.395 --> 00:58.643
No. You?

00:58.720 --> 00:59.978
Nothing.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.315
Hopefully they've forgotten me now.

01:04.143 --> 01:07.610
And what about work? Have
you been able to find any?

01:14.540 --> 01:15.991
I did. I did.

01:19.686 --> 01:20.919
English, Amira.

01:20.944 --> 01:23.701
If he needs money,

01:23.726 --> 01:25.756
maybe he needs food?

01:26.475 --> 01:28.233
Amira, you know I'm working, huh?

01:28.683 --> 01:30.717
What's the story they told?

01:30.742 --> 01:34.137
So many people came for Mama's Maqlubeh

01:34.406 --> 01:38.266
that we finished it all?
Baba had to bring more lamb?

01:38.625 --> 01:41.228
You remember that? You were so young.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.952
We should be celebrating.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.779
What? We went to prayers.
I got you new clothes.

01:46.422 --> 01:48.568
I wish they were still here.

01:50.263 --> 01:51.821
I know.

02:04.099 --> 02:06.256
I want to come to the hospital with you.

02:06.281 --> 02:08.257
- Amira.
- It's Saturday.

02:08.282 --> 02:10.965
I will be quiet. I won't move.
I'll do my homework.

02:10.990 --> 02:12.508
I have a lot of homework, Bash.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.471
Amira, it's not the kind of place
people go for no reason, okay?

02:15.496 --> 02:18.848
I have a reason. I want
to be with you today.

02:21.049 --> 02:22.405
Okay.

02:34.746 --> 02:36.254
Hello, Dr. Leblanc.

02:36.279 --> 02:38.746
Force of habit. I'm sorry.

02:45.787 --> 02:48.503
I know I've missed a few appointments.
I know.

02:49.727 --> 02:51.792
All you're supposed to do
is see me twice a year.

02:51.817 --> 02:53.175
Yeah, I know.

02:54.538 --> 02:56.004
You're avoiding me, Magalie.

02:56.029 --> 02:58.346
No, I'm... I'm busy.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.815
Your rhythm's normal now,

03:02.840 --> 03:05.508
but there was a flag on
your remote monitoring.

03:05.544 --> 03:07.184
- Arrhythmia?
- Mm.

03:07.247 --> 03:10.020
- More than one flag?
- Three. You didn't feel them?

03:10.045 --> 03:11.621
We replace a pacemaker every six years.

03:11.646 --> 03:13.076
I've had this one almost that long.

03:13.101 --> 03:14.408
It's probably just a glitch.

03:14.433 --> 03:17.201
Humour me. How've you been feeling?

03:17.226 --> 03:19.754
Totally at odds with whatever
report that thing sent you.

03:19.779 --> 03:21.168
I'm fine. If there was anything wrong,

03:21.193 --> 03:22.911
I'd be feeling dizziness,
shortness of breath, chest pain.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.731
Yeah, yeah, you're a doctor, I get it.

03:24.910 --> 03:27.066
I'd still like to do a
stress test to be sure.

03:28.570 --> 03:30.182
Half an hour. That's all I need.

03:30.207 --> 03:31.614
I've got to go to work. Next week?

03:31.639 --> 03:33.098
What do I have to do here, Mags?

03:33.123 --> 03:34.845
Get Bishop to make you
my cardiology fellow?

03:34.870 --> 03:36.514
I'll be back, I promise.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.442
Do you ever not start early?

03:45.467 --> 03:48.161
Oh! Ah! You need to tell me if you see

03:48.186 --> 03:49.903
the girl with snakes in her veins.

03:49.928 --> 03:51.903
Hey Charlie. Did you come
for a needle exchange?

03:51.928 --> 03:54.285
He was polling all of triage,
asking about snakes.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.848
Scared a couple people so they
said to put him in Exam 4.

03:56.873 --> 03:58.621
Okay. I'll get a nurse to start fluids.

03:58.646 --> 04:00.347
He seems a bit off his baseline.

04:00.372 --> 04:02.243
Good morning, Dr. Curtis.

04:10.512 --> 04:14.559
Lou? Are you two a thing?
Like a secret work thing?

04:15.530 --> 04:16.964
Please learn boundaries.

04:16.988 --> 04:19.829
Fast start today, we
have a GSW coming in,

04:19.855 --> 04:22.862
33-year-old male, ETA 8 minutes.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.533
I need blood. I need bodies.

04:24.558 --> 04:26.393
There's a found down on the way in too.

04:26.418 --> 04:30.588
Dr. Hamed takes the found down. Dr.
Curtis, Dr. Leblanc with the GSW.

04:30.613 --> 04:31.862
Any info on the patient?

04:31.887 --> 04:34.081
Elderly woman in cardiac arrest.
That's all I've got.

04:34.106 --> 04:37.742
Oh and good news. I'll
be your attending today.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.979
What? It was a scheduling mess up.

04:42.019 --> 04:44.160
Meaning you went in and messed it up?

04:46.897 --> 04:49.071
Lena Joseph, 85 years old,

04:49.096 --> 04:51.385
VF arrest. Mailman saw her
in the living room floor and

04:51.416 --> 04:52.659
broke through the front window.

04:52.684 --> 04:55.651
She's obviously been down for
some time, she looks dehydrated.

04:55.689 --> 04:59.440
12 minutes CPR. Defib'd
twice and two doses of epi.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.600
No pulse. She's still in VFIB.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.730
Okay, charging the defibrillator, 200J,

05:04.755 --> 05:07.206
unsynchronized. Everybody clear.

05:07.231 --> 05:09.226
<i>Shock advised.</i>

05:09.283 --> 05:11.284
Start compressions right away.

05:11.564 --> 05:14.070
Do we know how long she was lying
here before anybody found her?

05:14.095 --> 05:16.227
Could've been days. The
mailman said she lives alone.

05:16.252 --> 05:18.049
There's a daughter, but
she wasn't around.

05:18.225 --> 05:20.378
Two minutes of CPR and
then a pulse check.

05:20.403 --> 05:24.024
Will Marsh, BP 80 over
60, heart rate 110.

05:24.049 --> 05:26.017
They were held up at
gunpoint outside a bank.

05:26.042 --> 05:27.245
Will pushed me out of the way.

05:27.270 --> 05:29.955
I was handing over my purse
and the guy shot anyway!

05:29.980 --> 05:33.042
Okay, stay here, alright?
Stay right here.

05:35.635 --> 05:38.221
One, two, three.

05:38.246 --> 05:40.174
Will, can you feel your arms and legs?

05:40.199 --> 05:41.471
What do we have?

05:41.871 --> 05:44.659
Single penetrating bullet
wound to the abdomen.

05:44.684 --> 05:46.752
Husband and wife report
hearing one shot fired.

05:46.777 --> 05:48.344
Has he been persistently hypotensive?

05:48.585 --> 05:51.667
80's four over 62.

05:51.692 --> 05:53.619
Let's log roll him to
check for other wounds.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.861
On three. One, two, three.

05:56.886 --> 05:58.900
Stop! Please

05:58.925 --> 06:01.260
Will, let me know where it hurts!

06:04.400 --> 06:07.073
- No exit wound.
- One, two, three.

06:08.031 --> 06:10.589
The bullet is still inside, sir.

06:10.614 --> 06:12.861
What does the bullet rule say, Dr.
Leblanc?

06:13.229 --> 06:16.257
The bullet wound seen on imaging
should always be an even number.

06:16.282 --> 06:20.283
LOC decreasing. Get him
some blood and TXA.

06:24.244 --> 06:26.626
- FAST positive.
- Let's get an AP,

06:26.651 --> 06:28.159
abdomen and chest,

06:28.184 --> 06:30.620
see if we can find the
bullet or fragments.

06:31.213 --> 06:34.115
Let's roll him, on three.
One, two, three.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.816
One, two, three.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.502
Give me a sec.

06:39.893 --> 06:40.993
Will?

06:41.018 --> 06:42.890
Ma'am, you can't be in here right now.

06:42.915 --> 06:44.791
Lucy, Will's a fighter! Okay?

06:44.816 --> 06:46.033
We need to figure out the path

06:46.058 --> 06:47.604
the bullet took when it
went through his body

06:47.629 --> 06:50.237
Dr. Bishop? Looks like the bullet
is lodged against his pancreas.

06:50.262 --> 06:52.997
The best thing you can do for
Will is to give us space to work.

06:53.022 --> 06:54.682
I'll come and explain everything after.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.893
Find out how long OR needs
for an emergency lap.

06:56.918 --> 06:58.182
On it.

06:59.233 --> 07:01.042
While you're filling the wife in,

07:01.067 --> 07:03.409
- get a full medical history.
- Copy.

07:04.107 --> 07:06.125
Recharging defib.

07:06.150 --> 07:08.331
Stop compressions. Everybody clear.

07:08.382 --> 07:10.432
<i>Shock advised.</i>

07:13.829 --> 07:15.812
Okay, I've got a pulse.

07:17.243 --> 07:18.815
She's waking up!

07:20.143 --> 07:21.818
Mrs. Joseph?

07:24.034 --> 07:26.035
It's good to have you back with us.

07:26.060 --> 07:27.682
This isn't right.

07:27.707 --> 07:30.924
It's okay. You were
under cardiac arrest,

07:30.949 --> 07:32.703
but we were able to revive you.

07:33.808 --> 07:37.208
You were supposed to let me die.

07:55.297 --> 07:59.603
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:00.965 --> 08:02.691
- Well, that's a new one.

08:03.223 --> 08:06.143
Charlie's in the vents? Going where?

08:07.324 --> 08:08.958
Pharmacy, maybe.

08:09.252 --> 08:11.823
He's out of luck, all the
narcotics are locked up.

08:13.597 --> 08:15.947
Should I call the cops, Dr. Bishop?

08:16.112 --> 08:17.456
Or the fire department?

08:17.481 --> 08:19.751
Not much point until we can find him.

08:19.776 --> 08:22.401
We've known Charlie for years.
He's harmless.

08:22.426 --> 08:24.018
Best to try and coax him down

08:24.043 --> 08:26.541
before we have to take
more drastic action.

08:26.746 --> 08:29.041
I connected with Lena
Joseph's daughter, Erin.

08:29.066 --> 08:30.122
She's on her way.

08:30.147 --> 08:31.448
How did she react?

08:31.612 --> 08:33.712
Like she found out her
mother almost died.

08:33.738 --> 08:35.409
Not sure there's a standard response.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.400
I don't know how you'd be
able to forgive yourself

08:37.426 --> 08:39.044
for something like that.

08:40.717 --> 08:42.553
We don't know the whole story.

08:42.578 --> 08:46.027
Well, we know she wasn't there,
and her mother was alone.

08:47.048 --> 08:51.526
I've learned to not let what
happens here affect me personally.

08:53.349 --> 08:56.078
Or maybe it's what makes
you a good doctor.

09:01.272 --> 09:03.440
Miles, this is Doctor Hunter.

09:03.465 --> 09:05.222
You can call me Theo.

09:05.247 --> 09:06.995
What seems to be the problem, pal?

09:07.020 --> 09:08.831
Persistent erection.

09:09.125 --> 09:10.843
That can happen.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.012
You here by yourself?

09:13.988 --> 09:16.213
He didn't wanna give
us his mom's number.

09:16.599 --> 09:17.933
Okay.

09:18.145 --> 09:19.936
How long it's been going on?

09:21.738 --> 09:24.439
Could you give us a minute? Thank you.

09:28.688 --> 09:30.472
Four hours.

09:31.588 --> 09:32.956
It hurts.

09:32.981 --> 09:35.159
Okay, Miles, you're going
to be fine, but...

09:35.184 --> 09:38.268
four hours is a long time. You
wanna tell me what's going on?

09:38.293 --> 09:40.761
I was supposed to meet
this girl after school.

09:40.786 --> 09:42.791
So you took something.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.909
I found some of my dad's old pills.

09:44.934 --> 09:46.971
And that's why you didn't
want us to call your mom.

09:46.996 --> 09:49.831
She'd freak! We don't talk
about this kind of stuff.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.011
It might resolve with ice
and pseudoephedrine.

09:52.354 --> 09:54.845
If plan A works, we don't
have to call your mom.

09:54.870 --> 09:56.037
What's plan B?

09:56.062 --> 09:58.433
Let's cross that bridge
if we come to it. Okay?

10:02.760 --> 10:04.285
Are you my mother's doctor?

10:04.318 --> 10:06.889
- Yes. Bashir Hamed.
- Hi.

10:09.686 --> 10:11.737
They said that you were out of town?

10:12.073 --> 10:14.550
At a month-long training
program for work.

10:14.672 --> 10:18.359
But I drove straight back
here as soon as they called.

10:19.130 --> 10:21.080
I saw her just before I left.

10:23.573 --> 10:25.928
How could I have missed
her being so ill?

10:25.953 --> 10:28.722
She was extremely dehydrated
when she was brought in.

10:28.747 --> 10:30.159
Malnourished.

10:30.435 --> 10:33.112
She hadn't had any food
or water for days.

10:33.287 --> 10:35.222
I stocked her fridge.

10:35.388 --> 10:37.808
I even tried to set her
up with a meal program.

10:37.833 --> 10:39.306
Has she been...

10:39.604 --> 10:41.808
forgetful? Or...

10:42.027 --> 10:44.395
I don't think so. Why?

10:44.420 --> 10:48.065
It's possible that she stopped
eating and drinking...

10:48.090 --> 10:49.608
on purpose.

10:49.755 --> 10:53.278
No. My mother would never do that.

10:59.098 --> 11:01.032
- Lucy?
- Hmm?

11:01.342 --> 11:05.058
Will's being prepped for an emergency
surgery to remove the bullet.

11:05.306 --> 11:08.183
But you said it's been
lodged in his abdomen?

11:08.208 --> 11:10.394
Yes. Which caused significant bleeding.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.800
Surgeons will be able to
tell us if there's damage

11:12.825 --> 11:15.174
to his organs once they take it out.

11:15.513 --> 11:18.388
Do you want to sit down? Please.

11:20.940 --> 11:22.260
Um...

11:22.681 --> 11:26.050
The guy, he smelled like cigarettes.

11:26.266 --> 11:29.439
And at first, I thought he was
just waiting to use the machine.

11:29.896 --> 11:32.164
I just wanted to stop for cash.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.906
And if I didn't, none of
this would be happening.

11:37.908 --> 11:40.450
Police told us they
arrested the shooter.

11:40.722 --> 11:43.371
Now he asked if I was doing okay.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.838
He's lying there...

11:46.584 --> 11:48.167
Bleeding...

11:49.377 --> 11:51.671
and he's asking if I'm okay?

11:52.276 --> 11:54.256
You found yourself a good one.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.301
I don't deserve him.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.984
I'm sure that's not true.

12:00.729 --> 12:02.515
But Will needs you now.

12:03.994 --> 12:07.517
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about his medical history.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.147
It'll help us treat him.

12:10.594 --> 12:12.534
Let's start with medication.

12:12.559 --> 12:15.652
Is he taking anything regularly?

12:17.208 --> 12:19.790
Mom? Your doctor thinks

12:19.815 --> 12:22.325
that you may have stopped
eating on purpose?

12:23.887 --> 12:25.844
I told him there's no
way that could be true.

12:25.869 --> 12:29.583
But are you not feeling well?
Have you lost your appetite?

12:29.813 --> 12:32.920
I didn't want you to
have to deal with this.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.968
Are you saying he's right?

12:42.212 --> 12:44.807
I'm so sorry, honey.

12:46.652 --> 12:51.106
The cleaner was coming Monday.
He was going to find me.

12:51.446 --> 12:54.149
- You tried to die?
- More like...

12:54.871 --> 12:57.320
I stopped trying to live.

12:57.972 --> 13:01.199
Food. Water.

13:01.344 --> 13:02.783
My pills.

13:03.355 --> 13:05.661
I had it all planned out

13:06.054 --> 13:07.872
I don't understand Why.

13:08.057 --> 13:09.691
Why would you do this?

13:09.716 --> 13:11.834
I'm old, Erin.

13:12.044 --> 13:14.045
Everything hurts.

13:14.417 --> 13:17.298
I wanted to control this.

13:17.766 --> 13:19.988
Go on my terms.

13:20.178 --> 13:21.779
While I still could.

13:22.017 --> 13:25.556
How could you be thinking
like this and not tell me?

13:25.767 --> 13:27.808
Please, honey.

13:28.078 --> 13:30.143
Try to understand.

13:31.823 --> 13:35.023
You know how awful it was when Dad went.

13:35.091 --> 13:38.160
So I'm just supposed to be
okay with losing you too?

13:41.808 --> 13:43.293
No. I can't hear this.

13:43.513 --> 13:46.076
I can't hear this right now.

13:54.305 --> 13:56.215
She taught high school physics.

13:56.577 --> 13:59.966
She always pushed me to
be rational, ordered,

14:00.183 --> 14:01.634
even as a kid.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.513
I've never heard her sound like that.

14:06.538 --> 14:09.100
Are you sure she hasn't been
struggling with depression?

14:09.221 --> 14:11.140
It's been tough since Dad passed,

14:11.165 --> 14:13.088
but that's been two years now.

14:13.431 --> 14:15.357
I thought she was fine.

14:17.195 --> 14:18.878
That is not her.

14:18.903 --> 14:23.006
At her age, there could be some
underlying neurological condition.

14:23.238 --> 14:26.206
I'd like to send her to get a
CT scan and cognitive testing.

14:26.231 --> 14:29.689
Something like dementia can cause
extreme personality changes.

14:29.714 --> 14:31.215
Yes. Please.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.249
Please do everything you can.

14:33.621 --> 14:36.237
- I will.
- Thank you.

14:42.759 --> 14:44.291
Anything?

14:45.878 --> 14:47.572
Should I try more...

14:47.597 --> 14:51.111
I think we're beyond manual labour.
Time for plan B.

14:51.136 --> 14:53.103
You never said what that was.

14:53.231 --> 14:55.854
We drain it with a needle. Don't worry.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.316
It sounds worse than it is.
We use freezing.

14:58.953 --> 15:01.228
Ugh, can we wait a little longer?

15:01.253 --> 15:04.447
I think if you call my mom, she's
definitely gonna call my dad.

15:06.317 --> 15:08.658
He moved to San Francisco
after they split.

15:09.030 --> 15:11.151
Well, I don't live in the
same city as my kids,

15:11.176 --> 15:14.345
and I'd still want to know
what's going on with them.

15:14.370 --> 15:16.127
Do you visit them?

15:16.503 --> 15:17.910
Mine doesn't.

15:18.515 --> 15:19.882
And now...

15:20.301 --> 15:23.548
my mom's gonna blame him
because they were his pills.

15:23.989 --> 15:27.761
Which is only gonna give him
more reason not to visit.

15:29.847 --> 15:31.432
Okay.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.600
We can give it a bit longer.

15:43.186 --> 15:44.736
Hey.

15:49.398 --> 15:51.076
Are you avoiding me?

15:52.845 --> 15:56.040
First we can't be seen together,
and now I can't smile at you?

15:57.466 --> 16:01.419
Look. When I see you, I smile.
I can't help it.

16:01.444 --> 16:04.714
I just don't want everyone knowing
our business. Okay? So...

16:06.232 --> 16:09.047
Or is it that you're embarrassed
to be dating the help?

16:09.072 --> 16:11.086
Would you stop talking
about yourself like that?

16:11.211 --> 16:13.343
If that's not the problem, then what is?

16:13.368 --> 16:15.393
You really wanna do this now?

16:16.849 --> 16:19.145
Maybe we shouldn't do it at all.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.294
Is that the CT on your found down?

16:26.473 --> 16:28.880
Mrs. Joseph. Radiology
reported it's clear.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.622
Next step is to order a psych eval.

16:30.776 --> 16:32.966
You know you're going to
need my sign-off for that.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.927
She has chronic kidney disease,
but good support from family

16:35.952 --> 16:37.420
and no other physical issues.

16:37.445 --> 16:39.207
I want to know why she
tried to kill herself.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.880
Well, she's 85. She's ill.

16:44.365 --> 16:46.716
There's a possibility
she may just be ready.

16:46.827 --> 16:50.075
She'll need dialysis in the next
year, but she's far from terminal.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.380
We're all terminal.

16:51.405 --> 16:53.591
It's just a case of when
we figure that out.

16:53.616 --> 16:55.286
We owe it to her to be sure.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.802
You know, we do have a policy.

16:57.827 --> 17:00.318
If a case bumps against
a doctor's belief

17:00.343 --> 17:02.239
system, -he's allowed to hand it off.

17:02.264 --> 17:04.435
This has nothing to do
with my belief system.

17:04.461 --> 17:07.848
It's about making sure that I'm
everything that I can for Mrs. Joseph.

17:07.873 --> 17:10.559
And for her daughter, who isn't
ready to lose her mother.

17:11.095 --> 17:13.396
Okay, see what psych has to say.

17:13.421 --> 17:14.684
Thank you.

17:15.113 --> 17:18.239
The kid's been in the room for
three hours. I need the bed.

17:18.263 --> 17:19.458
Give him a little longer.

17:19.483 --> 17:21.848
I think you should put him out
of his misery and drain it.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.153
Well, thanks for your opinion.
I'll let you know what I decide.

17:24.178 --> 17:26.685
Is this your priapism? The
kid's afraid of a needle?

17:26.710 --> 17:29.245
I think he's more afraid to
tell his mom he's having sex.

17:29.653 --> 17:32.036
Well, you know we do have a policy.

17:32.061 --> 17:34.323
If a case bumps against a
doctor's belief system,

17:34.333 --> 17:36.388
he is allowed to hand it off.

17:36.413 --> 17:38.356
I'm just trying to be his ally.

17:38.381 --> 17:41.317
A minor can make a consent for himself,

17:41.342 --> 17:42.599
as long as you're confident

17:42.624 --> 17:44.582
that he understands the
weight of the decision.

17:44.607 --> 17:48.068
Either way, Claire's right.
What goes up must come down.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.692
Glad I'm not a teenager these days.

17:54.717 --> 17:57.161
Glad I never had to raise any.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.509
Speaking of, how's yours?

17:59.534 --> 18:01.149
Barely talking to me, as usual.

18:01.174 --> 18:04.042
Oh. Guess it's your move then.

18:07.613 --> 18:09.632
I haven't noticed you fasting.

18:09.715 --> 18:12.083
It isn't Ramadan.
That's a different Eid.

18:12.128 --> 18:14.332
Oh... Hey, mind if I ask you a question?

18:14.357 --> 18:15.371
Mm-hmm.

18:15.396 --> 18:17.068
So there's Christmas
and Easter Christians,

18:17.093 --> 18:19.739
there's Sunday Christians, there's
every day, all day Christians.

18:19.764 --> 18:22.356
Is it kind the same thing with Muslims?

18:22.381 --> 18:25.147
- It's complicated.
- But you pray every day?

18:28.213 --> 18:30.590
Some days, I pray five times a day.

18:30.615 --> 18:32.946
And some days, I don't pray at all.

18:51.151 --> 18:52.869
I thought you weren't working today.

18:52.894 --> 18:54.861
Weren't you supposed to go home?

18:54.933 --> 18:56.822
Yeah. I picked up a shift.

18:56.984 --> 19:00.454
Melissa thinks it's hard on the girls
when I'm in and out so quickly.

19:00.479 --> 19:02.002
You know, we decided

19:02.425 --> 19:05.021
I should only go back when I
can stay for a longer time.

19:06.159 --> 19:07.753
That can't be easy.

19:09.284 --> 19:10.860
It's for the best.

19:12.130 --> 19:13.696
I can focus on my work.

19:19.389 --> 19:20.953
Will?

19:21.455 --> 19:24.595
Will! Hey! You're awake!

19:24.893 --> 19:26.684
Oh, thank God!

19:27.996 --> 19:30.268
About earlier I... I don't...

19:30.293 --> 19:33.506
Don't say anything.

19:36.146 --> 19:38.012
Just don't go.

19:38.651 --> 19:40.346
I won't.

19:42.148 --> 19:46.311
Will. I love you.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.230
Will?

19:49.255 --> 19:50.858
Will?

19:51.942 --> 19:53.576
Will, hey! Help!

19:53.601 --> 19:55.321
Help, help, help!

19:55.346 --> 19:57.113
I need help in here!

19:57.879 --> 20:00.509
Pressure's tanking. What happened?
Is he seizing?

20:00.534 --> 20:02.330
He was awake for one
second then he wasn't.

20:02.355 --> 20:03.814
Ma'am, I need you to step back.

20:03.839 --> 20:05.283
Looks more like decorticate posturing.

20:05.308 --> 20:06.384
Intracranial hemorrhaging?

20:06.409 --> 20:08.775
We checked his whole body, there
was no sign of head trauma.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.235
We need to intubate, get him to CT.
Repeat his blood work.

20:11.260 --> 20:12.971
- Prep 30 etomidate, 100 sux.
- Got it.

20:12.996 --> 20:14.260
His INR levels were elevated but

20:14.285 --> 20:16.244
within range for a trauma
patient with coagulopathy.

20:16.269 --> 20:18.009
What are you thinking, blood thinners?

20:18.034 --> 20:19.330
Well, if he's on them, he's gonna bleed.

20:19.355 --> 20:21.783
Even the slightest bump to his
head could trigger a hemorrhage.

20:21.808 --> 20:24.198
Lucy, you said that Will wasn't
taking any medication. Are you sure?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.040
But if there's any chance he
was taking blood thinners,

20:26.065 --> 20:27.103
we need to know now.

20:27.128 --> 20:30.522
We... We haven't been
together for five months.

20:31.090 --> 20:32.627
I left him.

20:35.812 --> 20:38.790
I'm not going to admit
Lena Joseph to psychiatry.

20:38.815 --> 20:41.417
She wants to die, that
means she's depressed.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.759
Not in the way I choose
to treat clinically.

20:43.795 --> 20:45.174
Is this about her age?

20:45.199 --> 20:47.518
Would you say the same
thing if she was 20?

20:47.543 --> 20:49.556
Maybe not. But that's my point.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.705
You see, most of what we do here
is artificially prolonging life.

20:52.730 --> 20:55.650
Resuscitation,
catheterization, surgery...

20:55.675 --> 20:58.883
She's wrestling with this because
she's in her 80s and ill.

20:58.908 --> 21:00.322
It would be a mistake to apply

21:00.347 --> 21:03.415
a black and white stance to
a more nuanced situation.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.603
I don't consider wanting to
help her taking a stance,

21:05.628 --> 21:07.571
I consider it my responsibility, doctor.

21:07.620 --> 21:11.146
Wanting to control the way
we go out isn't uncommon.

21:11.713 --> 21:13.712
Look, as her primary physician,

21:13.737 --> 21:16.228
you can keep her in a
72-hour psych hold,

21:16.253 --> 21:17.728
but if it was just up to me?

21:17.753 --> 21:20.244
I'd cut her loose as soon as
she's physically ready to go.

21:20.269 --> 21:22.096
Well, then I'm glad it isn't up to you.

21:22.121 --> 21:26.157
You're the doctor from Syria? Yeah?

21:26.328 --> 21:28.563
I treat a lot of patients
who come from war zones.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.022
We just met, so this is not a judgment,

21:31.047 --> 21:33.009
but if you ever need to talk to someone,

21:33.081 --> 21:34.557
feel free to reach out.

21:48.728 --> 21:51.830
Don't you have a fancy coffee
machine in your office?

21:51.853 --> 21:53.517
Well, I'm a man of the people, Claire.

21:53.542 --> 21:55.658
Of course, and by that you
mean another egomaniac

21:55.683 --> 21:57.048
doctor who knows everything?

21:57.073 --> 21:58.962
Well, yeah.

21:58.987 --> 22:01.150
But if you're still holding a
grudge against Dr. Hunter,

22:01.175 --> 22:03.907
- then you shouldn't because he's...
- A good guy?

22:03.932 --> 22:06.064
Do you want me to talk to him?

22:06.089 --> 22:07.970
Uh, no. No, it wasn't a big deal.

22:07.995 --> 22:09.854
And you know I can fight my own battles.

22:09.879 --> 22:12.041
Of that, I am well aware.

22:13.313 --> 22:14.939
Is that it? You just came to tell me

22:14.964 --> 22:16.915
all the different ways in
which I disappoint you?

22:16.940 --> 22:19.166
And that I changed my mind.

22:19.191 --> 22:20.463
About Theo?

22:20.488 --> 22:21.855
About dinner.

22:22.620 --> 22:24.845
You asked me the other day.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.430
Tonight?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.298
Tomorrow. And I'm buying.

22:29.418 --> 22:31.330
I just got an offer on the house.

22:31.756 --> 22:33.520
You're selling your mother's house?

22:34.211 --> 22:35.511
You love that house.

22:35.536 --> 22:38.775
Well, I've been letting go
of a few things lately.

22:40.481 --> 22:43.613
Well, I'll book us a table.
Somewhere expensive.

22:45.758 --> 22:48.670
Right now, we're balancing
two opposing problems.

22:48.695 --> 22:50.763
Will's abdominal injury from the bullet,

22:50.788 --> 22:53.703
and the brain bleed, which is what
caused him to lose consciousness.

22:53.728 --> 22:55.259
Can you fix them?

22:55.284 --> 22:56.712
Individually, yes.

22:56.737 --> 23:00.029
But they both require
equally emergent surgeries.

23:00.811 --> 23:02.116
There are risks either way,

23:02.141 --> 23:05.280
but the surgeons will want you
to weigh in on who goes first.

23:05.349 --> 23:07.017
They want me to decide?

23:07.295 --> 23:08.998
Well, even if you're separated,

23:09.023 --> 23:11.756
while legally married, you're
still his next of kin.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.152
But you said he was stable.

23:13.177 --> 23:15.436
Blood thinners make your
blood less likely to clot.

23:15.647 --> 23:18.607
Which makes you more susceptible
to internal bleeds.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.843
- There are precautions, but...
- But you didn't know.

23:22.673 --> 23:24.107
Will's had a tough year.

23:24.464 --> 23:29.368
His father had all these
heart problems and um...

23:30.311 --> 23:32.077
I cheated on him.

23:32.304 --> 23:34.580
We met up today, and he...

23:35.223 --> 23:37.083
said he forgave me.

23:38.464 --> 23:40.378
That he still loved me.

23:41.963 --> 23:43.715
But I didn't say it back.

23:44.989 --> 23:46.198
Not until just now,

23:46.223 --> 23:48.719
when I saw him, and he
needed to hear me say it.

23:50.633 --> 23:52.237
But it wasn't true.

23:53.728 --> 23:55.811
- You can do this.
- No.

23:55.929 --> 23:58.063
I'm the one that keeps on hurting him.

23:58.357 --> 24:01.190
How can I be the one making
decisions about his life?

24:02.370 --> 24:03.503
You decide.

24:03.528 --> 24:05.706
No. I can walk you through
the options, but I can't...

24:05.731 --> 24:07.238
Please.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.450
We'll do this together.

24:12.068 --> 24:14.628
I'm sorry. I can't.

24:35.107 --> 24:38.052
Hey. Are you okay?

24:38.114 --> 24:39.448
You're sweating.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.467
He could die, and she could just...

24:41.621 --> 24:43.506
How could she just walk away?

24:44.162 --> 24:46.553
Listen. It's not our job to
make her a stronger person.

24:46.578 --> 24:49.256
Alright? Did you find out why her
husband's on blood thinners?

24:49.342 --> 24:50.834
She didn't know.

24:52.787 --> 24:54.584
I think I might, though.

24:54.684 --> 24:56.330
And deep breath in.

24:58.027 --> 25:01.607
What happens now? Are you
gonna let me go home?

25:01.632 --> 25:03.754
Not until I'm sure you're ready.

25:04.193 --> 25:07.841
Until you're sure I won't
do it again, you mean.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.248
Your daughter is very
concerned about you.

25:14.434 --> 25:16.307
You think I'm selfish.

25:16.669 --> 25:19.518
If I was your mother,
you'd be upset too.

25:20.062 --> 25:22.327
I watched the sacrifices Erin made

25:22.352 --> 25:24.753
to be with her father
through his illness.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.651
It just seemed like...

25:27.384 --> 25:31.323
if I was ready anyway, why
wouldn't I spare her that?

25:31.610 --> 25:34.992
In my experience, people don't
always want to be spared.

25:36.505 --> 25:38.329
Tell me the OR's ready for him.

25:38.354 --> 25:39.837
Well, neurosurgery and Trauma

25:39.862 --> 25:41.924
are both saying their
needs are priority. So...

25:41.949 --> 25:43.587
And his wife walked away.

25:45.497 --> 25:47.198
Then I make the call.

25:48.750 --> 25:51.259
Between two terrible options.

25:53.071 --> 25:56.900
Unless there's a third that
I'm not smart enough to see.

25:57.545 --> 25:59.309
Well, actually there is.

26:00.336 --> 26:01.970
Will's father had a heart attack.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.524
- So you did get a history?
- No, it was more like a confession.

26:04.549 --> 26:07.204
But turns out Will has a family
history of heart problems,

26:07.229 --> 26:09.306
which may be why he's on blood thinners.

26:09.331 --> 26:10.719
His INR is two,

26:10.744 --> 26:12.267
so he's more likely to be on Coumadin

26:12.292 --> 26:14.009
than any of the newer anti-coags.

26:14.034 --> 26:15.688
And if we dose him with vitamin K

26:15.713 --> 26:17.360
and a prothrombin complex concentrate,

26:17.399 --> 26:19.962
then we can reverse his
propensity to bleed.

26:19.987 --> 26:21.373
That could buy time.

26:21.456 --> 26:24.611
Neuro could go in, start the
craniotomy, relieve the clot,

26:24.636 --> 26:27.378
then Trauma can take over and
fix the intra-abdo bleed.

26:28.505 --> 26:31.048
Get the surgeons talking
to each other. Go.

26:42.552 --> 26:45.444
Oh, uh... Sorry. I'm sorry.

26:45.469 --> 26:47.231
Are you okay?

27:01.522 --> 27:02.964
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.090
You looking for someone?

27:04.115 --> 27:05.130
My little sister.

27:05.155 --> 27:07.404
She's supposed to be
here doing her homework.

27:07.429 --> 27:09.379
Homework on a Saturday?

27:09.404 --> 27:11.677
Girl after my own heart.

27:11.702 --> 27:13.425
Bathroom, maybe?

27:13.906 --> 27:15.761
Yeah, probably.

27:16.775 --> 27:19.056
Seriously, I don't know how you do it.

27:19.231 --> 27:21.903
This job, and taking
care of your sister...

27:21.928 --> 27:24.489
I mean, I barely remember
to eat until four.

27:24.514 --> 27:26.688
I wouldn't exactly call that a meal.

27:28.860 --> 27:30.775
Did I see you checking your pulse?

27:32.130 --> 27:35.071
It's just an intense day.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.140
Want me to help you look for her?

27:37.165 --> 27:39.520
Yeah, oh...

27:40.723 --> 27:43.301
Um... it seems Arnold already found her.

27:43.326 --> 27:44.997
Excellent.

27:45.657 --> 27:47.725
This young lady says
she's related to you?

27:47.750 --> 27:50.582
She's supposed to be related
to me in the cafeteria.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.046
Thank you.

27:56.489 --> 27:58.215
You promised me you wouldn't move.

27:58.248 --> 27:59.411
I know.

27:59.436 --> 28:01.809
This isn't a playground, Amira.
This is my job.

28:01.834 --> 28:03.349
I know.

28:03.696 --> 28:05.560
What's wrong?

28:05.713 --> 28:08.187
I just wanted to remember how it felt.

28:09.284 --> 28:12.192
When Mama and Baba
would take me to work.

28:13.010 --> 28:14.477
It's Eid.

28:14.772 --> 28:16.918
We're all supposed to be together.

28:17.306 --> 28:21.326
You never talk about them. I'm
afraid I'm going to forget.

28:23.377 --> 28:25.137
Is this the famous sister?

28:25.162 --> 28:28.665
Amira. This is my boss, Dr. Bishop.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.641
Very nice to meet you.

28:30.666 --> 28:34.202
She was just headed back to the
cafeteria to finish her homework.

28:34.227 --> 28:35.928
Oh, fantastic. So was I.

28:35.953 --> 28:37.591
Not to do homework, obviously.

28:37.616 --> 28:38.957
I was gonna use my privileges

28:38.982 --> 28:41.273
to see if I could swing
some free snacks.

28:41.298 --> 28:42.556
Interested?

28:46.092 --> 28:48.817
Come on. I guess your
brother has to work.

28:56.848 --> 29:00.685
She's been awake since this
started, but feeling off.

29:00.710 --> 29:02.311
I'm cycling her BP.

29:02.390 --> 29:05.247
She said she felt light-headed,
then that monitor started beeping.

29:05.272 --> 29:08.012
Page cardiology. Wide
complex tachycardia.

29:08.037 --> 29:09.848
Let's start an Amiodarone infusion.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.559
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:14.874 --> 29:18.973
What you are experiencing is
called ventricular tachycardia.

29:18.998 --> 29:20.434
It's an irregular heartbeat

29:20.459 --> 29:24.012
likely brought on by electrolyte
abnormalities from not eating,

29:24.037 --> 29:26.661
coupled with our
interventions earlier today.

29:26.686 --> 29:27.926
Can you stop it?

29:27.951 --> 29:31.434
She'll need an angiogram
and we'll run medications.

29:31.459 --> 29:32.692
If she becomes unstable,

29:32.717 --> 29:36.271
then we'll shock her heart
to restore a normal rhythm.

29:36.296 --> 29:37.777
No.

29:39.112 --> 29:41.192
I thought you wanted to come home.

29:41.415 --> 29:45.129
No honey, you wanted me to.

29:45.287 --> 29:48.623
And I was willing to do it for you.

29:48.746 --> 29:53.153
But if Dr. Hamed is saying
this could be it...

29:53.178 --> 29:54.779
What would happen to her then?

29:55.028 --> 29:59.082
Without medications or an intervention
to reset her heart rhythm,

29:59.107 --> 30:03.710
you'll... you'll likely go
into cardiac arrest and die.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.929
No.

30:07.028 --> 30:09.503
Please, honey.

30:09.760 --> 30:12.457
This is what I want.

30:17.589 --> 30:19.215
You need to save her.

30:27.415 --> 30:29.672
Is there where *** come?

30:29.830 --> 30:31.931
The trauma bay, yes.

30:32.213 --> 30:34.572
That's where we do what's
called extreme measures

30:34.597 --> 30:36.775
to try to save people's lives.

30:37.033 --> 30:38.744
Does my brother do that?

30:38.769 --> 30:40.580
Well, I'll deny it if
you tell him I said so,

30:40.605 --> 30:42.800
but he's practically an expert.

30:43.734 --> 30:45.435
Our parents were doctors.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.814
They had a hospital in Syria before...

30:48.300 --> 30:50.100
before we came here.

30:50.799 --> 30:52.760
I never brought my son to the hospital.

30:52.785 --> 30:54.275
Maybe I should have.

30:54.387 --> 30:56.213
Definitely you should have.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.149
Okay.

30:59.549 --> 31:02.399
I can let you consent to
the procedure on your own,

31:02.424 --> 31:04.174
but if you don't want
talk to your parents,

31:04.199 --> 31:05.831
you need to talk to me first.

31:06.388 --> 31:08.760
That girl you were going to meet...

31:08.785 --> 31:09.994
she your girlfriend?

31:10.019 --> 31:12.384
What, like, you mean going steady?

31:13.396 --> 31:15.464
She's a girl I know from school.

31:15.489 --> 31:17.330
Were you planning on using protection?

31:17.355 --> 31:18.978
She said she's on the pill.

31:19.003 --> 31:21.322
- Not good enough.
- Alright, okay?

31:21.347 --> 31:22.978
I'll use a condom.

31:23.003 --> 31:24.509
What about the pill you took?

31:24.602 --> 31:26.205
Wanna explain to me why you did that?

31:26.361 --> 31:29.416
I just wanted to last.

31:30.324 --> 31:32.814
My friends say they can
go for 30 minutes.

31:32.839 --> 31:34.267
Your friends are lying.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.395
Ten minutes is normal, no matter
what the internet tells you.

31:38.143 --> 31:41.192
More importantly, if you have to
take a pill to impress a girl,

31:41.217 --> 31:43.251
she's not the right girl.

31:43.305 --> 31:46.971
You're telling me every girl you've
been with was the right one?

31:46.996 --> 31:48.330
I am.

31:48.761 --> 31:52.017
Because there's only been one,
and I'm still married to her.

31:52.042 --> 31:54.822
One girl? This whole time?=

31:54.847 --> 31:56.330
Thirteen years and counting.

31:56.355 --> 31:59.002
And you're trying to teach me about sex?

31:59.130 --> 32:01.088
How do you even know anything?

32:03.613 --> 32:05.267
Well, I know...

32:05.799 --> 32:08.588
that decisions have consequences.

32:10.696 --> 32:13.016
You're going to want
to take a deep breath.

32:18.189 --> 32:21.899
She's still in v-tach. Cardioversion
is the only other option.

32:22.439 --> 32:25.557
She requested a DNR and you
want to reset her heart?

32:25.582 --> 32:27.744
There's still a case for a psych hold,

32:27.769 --> 32:29.711
which would grant her
daughter power of attorney,

32:29.736 --> 32:30.981
so we can avoid the DNR.

32:31.006 --> 32:33.416
Well, Lena Joseph is your
patient, not her daughter.

32:33.441 --> 32:35.205
It's her wishes you'd be dismissing.

32:35.230 --> 32:37.264
No, it's her I'd be giving up on.

32:42.317 --> 32:44.051
You're a man of instinct.

32:44.251 --> 32:47.217
I know you can make hard
choices and save lives.

32:49.313 --> 32:51.553
That's not what you've
been asked to do here.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.851
Could be a couple of hours...

32:57.146 --> 32:58.852
no more than a day.

33:00.011 --> 33:02.606
I thought we were on the same side.

33:03.227 --> 33:04.942
We are.

33:05.524 --> 33:06.944
Hers.

33:09.061 --> 33:13.326
I know it's hard, but we have to
respect your mother's wishes.

33:17.590 --> 33:19.624
If I just had more time,

33:21.112 --> 33:23.962
I could make her see I
don't care if it's hard.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.215
I just don't wanna lose her.

33:36.387 --> 33:38.434
Now there's nothing I can do.

33:41.336 --> 33:43.314
But there is something you can do.

33:46.822 --> 33:49.644
You can take the chance to say goodbye.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.617
My parents...

33:59.033 --> 34:01.457
My parents both died suddenly.

34:02.397 --> 34:05.377
Long before I was ready to let them go.

34:08.726 --> 34:12.958
This may not be the way that
you want to say goodbye,

34:12.983 --> 34:15.179
but this time that you
have with her is a gift,

34:16.129 --> 34:18.389
if you choose to see it that way.

34:35.103 --> 34:36.380
Hey

34:36.405 --> 34:39.867
I shouldn't have left. It
was the wrong thing to do.

34:39.891 --> 34:41.512
Things just got so messed up, I...

34:41.542 --> 34:43.598
Is he... is he okay?

34:43.623 --> 34:44.934
He's in surgery.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.360
We were able to reverse the
effects of the blood thinners

34:47.385 --> 34:49.677
and stabilize him for both operations.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.411
So he's going to make it?

34:51.436 --> 34:52.942
It's too soon to tell,

34:52.967 --> 34:55.301
but the surgeons felt that
the risk was acceptable,

34:55.326 --> 34:56.824
given the alternative.

34:57.761 --> 35:01.184
When he wakes up, and when he's ready...

35:02.591 --> 35:04.435
I'm going to tell him
that he deserves to be

35:04.460 --> 35:06.032
with someone who loves him back.

35:06.057 --> 35:08.574
<i>Code Blue, OR 2. Code Blue, OR 2.</i>

35:08.599 --> 35:10.497
Wait over here.

35:33.442 --> 35:35.607
As your rhythm continues to deteriorate,

35:35.632 --> 35:38.006
you may feel the need for
more pain management.

35:38.031 --> 35:39.972
Let us know if that's the case.

35:41.797 --> 35:43.364
Honey.

35:47.045 --> 35:49.920
I know this isn't easy for you.

35:50.707 --> 35:53.795
We'll be back to check you
have everything that you need.

35:53.913 --> 35:55.756
There is one thing.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.201
My goulash recipe.

36:00.856 --> 36:03.329
I need to pass it on.

36:04.039 --> 36:07.624
You always said you'd
take that to your grave.

36:07.786 --> 36:09.794
And here we are.

36:15.488 --> 36:18.136
We could use a pen and paper.

36:23.491 --> 36:27.312
Mom, none of this is rational, you know?

36:27.526 --> 36:30.412
Some things just aren't.

36:57.779 --> 36:59.120
Hey.

36:59.295 --> 37:00.713
What are you doing right now?

37:00.738 --> 37:03.613
- Nothing, why?
- I need a favour

37:03.833 --> 37:06.017
We did everything we could.

37:09.381 --> 37:11.564
But in spite of our best effort...

37:13.615 --> 37:15.776
Will didn't survive his surgery.

37:18.311 --> 37:21.406
Will's dead?

37:22.792 --> 37:24.619
He fought really hard, Lucy.

37:26.668 --> 37:29.846
But in the end, both
injuries were just...

37:29.871 --> 37:31.363
they were too much for him to handle.

37:31.388 --> 37:33.666
You said he was going to be okay!

37:36.020 --> 37:40.189
How... How am I supposed to live
with things ending this way?

37:43.285 --> 37:47.150
I trusted you, and you didn't save him!

37:57.345 --> 38:00.166
Maybe if we'd looked twice
at his elevated INR...

38:00.191 --> 38:01.472
Don't do that. Alright?

38:01.497 --> 38:03.667
You did everything medically
possible to help that man.

38:03.692 --> 38:05.250
You even tried saving his marriage.

38:05.889 --> 38:08.190
She was upset. Her husband just died.

38:08.215 --> 38:10.381
You can't control the
way she reacts to that.

38:10.406 --> 38:11.987
Dr. Curtis isn't wrong.

38:12.475 --> 38:14.418
It was out of our control.

38:14.847 --> 38:16.515
That's the job.

38:17.005 --> 38:19.830
We move on and focus on
the things we can fix.

38:19.855 --> 38:22.331
Oh, God!

38:23.458 --> 38:26.393
- Uh...
- Charlie, don't move!

38:26.418 --> 38:28.884
I'm sorry, sir. He
just got away from me.

38:28.909 --> 38:30.807
- You okay, Charlie?
- Don't move, don't move.

38:30.832 --> 38:32.620
- I'm good! I'm good!
- No, no, no!

38:32.645 --> 38:35.236
Whoa, whoa! Okay! Not so good!

38:36.142 --> 38:37.771
Welcome back, Charlie.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.127
Try to stay with him this time, Lou.

38:40.596 --> 38:42.705
Okay... Where does it hurt?

38:42.947 --> 38:44.752
You know I'm not
embarrassed of you, right?

38:44.777 --> 38:46.837
But you don't want anyone
knowing about us, though.

38:46.862 --> 38:48.268
It's nobody's business.

38:48.293 --> 38:52.290
Mm... So we can only be together when...

38:52.402 --> 38:54.002
nobody's around?

38:54.027 --> 38:56.525
You want me to tell everyone
you're my boyfriend?

39:00.034 --> 39:03.314
Fine. He's my goddamn boyfriend.
You happy?

39:03.339 --> 39:06.330
What? 'Cause you told Charlie?
No offence Charlie.

39:06.597 --> 39:07.900
That's okay.

39:08.025 --> 39:11.427
I mean, I... I got a
goddamn girlfriend too.

39:12.047 --> 39:15.354
I can't find her though. She
got snakes in her veins.

39:15.379 --> 39:17.380
- Snakes in her veins?
- Yeah.

39:17.405 --> 39:19.448
- Just like me.
- Means an IV?

39:20.177 --> 39:22.235
Is your girlfriend a patient here?

39:22.524 --> 39:24.440
Is that who you've been looking for?

39:24.465 --> 39:26.198
Obviously.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.785
Any shortness of breath now?

39:29.859 --> 39:31.287
No.

39:32.923 --> 39:35.124
But I felt something earlier today.

39:36.865 --> 39:38.585
Rhythm looks good now.

39:38.915 --> 39:40.671
What were you doing at the time?

39:40.696 --> 39:42.966
Managing the wife of a critical patient.

39:43.563 --> 39:45.068
We lost him.

39:46.259 --> 39:48.190
I've been living with
this long enough to know

39:48.215 --> 39:50.284
that my symptoms can
sometimes be psychological

39:50.309 --> 39:52.526
They can also be physiological.

39:52.551 --> 39:54.861
- Yes.
- The only way for me to know

39:54.886 --> 39:58.314
is to see you more regularly,
and get a fuller picture.

40:00.286 --> 40:02.481
Every time I come here,
I feel like the...

40:02.506 --> 40:04.552
Like the sick little
kid everyone worried

40:04.577 --> 40:06.489
would never be strong enough.

40:06.514 --> 40:09.367
That's why it's so important
to be on top of this.

40:09.529 --> 40:11.894
So you don't have to be that kid again.

40:16.509 --> 40:17.960
Jonah, I...

40:17.985 --> 40:20.502
I wanted to see... how you are.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.809
There's something I need to tell you.

40:26.179 --> 40:30.149
Do young people even check
their voicemails these days?

40:30.174 --> 40:31.770
I'll send yoa text.

40:31.795 --> 40:33.286
It's your father.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.213
Am I doing it right now?

40:47.238 --> 40:48.805
Uh, yeah.

40:49.100 --> 40:51.067
Do you think it's ready?

40:51.105 --> 40:52.973
Uh, no keep stirring.

40:52.998 --> 40:54.461
Almost.

41:03.986 --> 41:06.526
- Eid Mubarak!
- Lamb! Bash!

41:06.551 --> 41:08.836
Dr. Hunter brought lamb!

41:11.142 --> 41:13.276
But every butcher I called was sold out!

41:13.301 --> 41:15.680
Us country boys have our connections.

41:15.705 --> 41:17.563
It's called Costco. Haha.

41:17.588 --> 41:19.524
It's Halal, I swear.

41:21.291 --> 41:23.399
Shukraan, Theo. Come on in.

41:23.728 --> 41:27.069
You are saying that you haven't
seen either one of them?

41:27.509 --> 41:29.633
I always fall asleep.

41:29.898 --> 41:31.500
If I had to pick one...

41:31.684 --> 41:33.208
An impossible question.

41:33.233 --> 41:35.798
The first is the perfect horror film.

41:35.823 --> 41:38.283
The second is the ultimate action movie.

41:40.285 --> 41:42.473
He made me watch them both,

41:42.498 --> 41:44.698
honestly I thought they
were the same movie.

41:44.738 --> 41:46.255
Bashir...

41:46.280 --> 41:49.097
Brother, sometimes I don't
know how we are friends.

41:51.948 --> 41:54.129
Theo, are you not enjoying the food?

41:54.154 --> 41:56.191
- Excuse me.
- Take some more!

42:09.560 --> 42:11.186
When you were three years old,

42:11.211 --> 42:13.886
you'd wake up at dawn every morning.

42:14.856 --> 42:17.553
Mama and Baba were
working and exhausted,

42:17.578 --> 42:21.491
but one of them would always get
up early and play with you,

42:21.516 --> 42:23.150
or take you for a walk.

42:23.753 --> 42:25.296
They did?

42:25.423 --> 42:28.592
When you finally started sleeping in,

42:28.839 --> 42:31.358
I would sometimes catch
them up early, just...

42:31.383 --> 42:33.011
sitting beside you.

42:33.482 --> 42:35.220
Watching you.

42:36.993 --> 42:38.890
Mama once told me that...

42:38.915 --> 42:41.227
no matter how tired she was,

42:41.492 --> 42:44.896
it was always her favourite
way to greet the morning.
