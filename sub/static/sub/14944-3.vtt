WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.544
NARRATOR:
Previously on Continuum.

00:04.547 --> 00:06.003
Nice shot.
I missed.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.672
I'm not going.
One goes,
we all go, Kellog.

00:08.759 --> 00:11.171
I'm establishing a task force
to take on this new threat.

00:11.262 --> 00:12.593
We could really
use someone

00:12.680 --> 00:16.138
with a deep understanding
of its methods and tactics,
Special Agent.

00:16.225 --> 00:17.340
She's using you.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.595
I'm missing a piece.

00:35.745 --> 00:36.905
CPS COP:
You two, get inside!

00:52.595 --> 00:53.630
KIERA: Terrorists.

00:55.890 --> 00:56.970
Explains the
heavy backup.

00:58.309 --> 00:59.799
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

01:03.314 --> 01:05.270
CPS COP:
Second landing clear.

01:11.489 --> 01:12.945
(BABY CRYING)

01:18.621 --> 01:20.486
CPS LEADER:
Cameron, give me a scan.

01:26.545 --> 01:29.002
The room's shielded.
I got nothing on
thermal or tactical.

01:31.968 --> 01:34.175
CPS LEADER:
Okay, people, remember,
this guy is ex-military

01:34.262 --> 01:35.843
and part of
the Bio-Enhancement program.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.341
So expect a heavyweight
with some major aggression.

01:38.474 --> 01:40.760
These juiced soldiers end up
turning into terrorists.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.934
It's the shots, makes them
big and strong.
Also makes them crazy.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.136
CPS LEADER:
Cut the chatter, people.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.692
Go. Three...

01:49.277 --> 01:50.312
(BEEPING)

01:55.700 --> 01:57.986
Go! Go! Stay down!
Stay down!

01:58.077 --> 01:59.192
Stay down!
Stay down!

01:59.287 --> 02:00.367
CPS COP:
Follow me through.

02:00.538 --> 02:01.527
KIERA:
One Tango, unarmed.

02:02.373 --> 02:03.704
Help. Help.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.540
CPS COP 1: All clear.

02:08.546 --> 02:09.626
CPS COP 2: Clear.

02:09.714 --> 02:11.705
We've got another one,
south wall.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.503
(GRUNTING)

02:20.891 --> 02:23.849
Holy shit.
Dispatch, this is tac-5.

02:24.228 --> 02:29.063
We just bagged
a Liber8 face, I repeat,
we got the Queen of hearts.

02:29.567 --> 02:30.602
DISPATCH: Roger that.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.897
DILLON: All right,
folks, let's settle down.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.317
Special Agent Cameron,
you have the floor.

02:37.408 --> 02:38.397
Thank you, sir.

02:40.745 --> 02:43.327
Intel on terror group
is scarce.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.370
But I will do my best
to bring you all
up to speed.

02:47.585 --> 02:50.873
Travis Verta,
ex-special forces,
tactician,

02:50.963 --> 02:52.749
well-trained in
hand-to-hand combat.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.205
He is most likely
calling the shots

02:57.011 --> 02:58.467
We all know Lucas lngram.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.887
He is the reason this
precinct was targeted.

03:01.974 --> 03:06.434
He's a high value member,
bomb maker,
engineer, technical expert.

03:06.604 --> 03:08.686
He's clever,
but he's arrogant.

03:09.482 --> 03:10.517
Curtis Chen.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.690
Another former soldier
with aggression issues.

03:14.487 --> 03:18.196
He likes to intimidate
and demonstrates
psychotic tendencies.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.941
Jasmine Garza,
weapons, vehicles.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.950
That's a lot
of ex-military.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.620
Should we be consulting
the Department of
Defense on this?

03:26.791 --> 03:27.871
We are in talks.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.789
But since they
all joined Liber8...

03:29.877 --> 03:31.617
Hold on. Liber8?
That's their name?

03:31.712 --> 03:32.827
KIERA: Yes.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.215
Since they all
joined after leaving
the services,

03:35.299 --> 03:37.585
this is now
a police matter.

03:38.469 --> 03:39.504
Moving on.

03:39.929 --> 03:42.341
We do not have an image
for Matthew Kellog.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.675
If his lips are moving,
he's probably lying.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.687
Which brings me
to Edouard Kagame.

03:51.774 --> 03:55.107
He's the leader of this cell
and possibly
the most dangerous.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.685
He hasn't been
spotted with the others
since they arrived,

03:57.780 --> 03:59.020
but if he is here,

03:59.115 --> 04:01.071
he's just
keeping a low profile.

04:02.243 --> 04:05.076
Finally, Sonya Valentine,
Queen of hearts.

04:06.080 --> 04:11.074
Partner of Travis,
former doctor in the military
Special Operations Division.

04:11.836 --> 04:13.542
She's got an IQ
that's off the charts.

04:14.505 --> 04:18.544
More likely to use
guile or subterfuge
than physical violence

04:18.634 --> 04:22.843
to achieve the gang's ends,
but keep your eyes on her
if she crosses your path.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.215
SONYA:
Cute, really cute.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.349
(MOANING)

04:30.438 --> 04:32.303
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

04:34.608 --> 04:36.439
No.
Huh?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.268
I got something
much better for you.
You're gonna love this.

04:39.405 --> 04:40.565
Yeah, what's that?

04:41.449 --> 04:42.484
(WHIRRING)

04:44.160 --> 04:45.195
(ZAPPING)

04:50.916 --> 04:55.000
KIERA:
2077, my time,
my city, my family.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.173
When terrorists killed
thousands of innocents,

04:58.257 --> 04:59.963
they were condemned to die.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.130
They had other plans.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.298
(EXPLOSION)

05:02.386 --> 05:05.048
A time-travel device
sent us all back 65 years.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.221
/ want to get home,
but / can’t be sure

05:07.308 --> 05:09.640
what / will return to
if history is changed.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.052
Their plan,
to corrupt and
control the present

05:13.147 --> 05:14.978
in order to win the future.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.477
What they didn't
plan on was me.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.740
You're gonna be okay.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.079
He needs a medic.
What about Sonya?

05:40.257 --> 05:41.463
A medic from this era.

05:41.926 --> 05:43.257
With access
to real drugs.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.465
Sign me up for that.

05:44.762 --> 05:45.797
(CHUCKLES)

05:48.265 --> 05:51.598
I don't think you appreciate
the delicate
situation that we're in.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.726
Yeah, you mean Travis?

05:54.980 --> 05:56.060
I mean us.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.017
If something
happens to Travis,

05:58.108 --> 05:59.973
this group is
gonna turn inside out.

06:00.236 --> 06:03.103
And we both know
who's gonna be
pushing for Alpha.

06:08.077 --> 06:09.112
Curtis?

06:09.995 --> 06:11.826
After Travis,
Sonya is most senior.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.496
Yeah. Well,
why don't you tell that
to Curtis?

06:16.794 --> 06:17.954
Hey! Where are
you going?

06:19.797 --> 06:22.083
I don't want to be here
if Travis flat lines.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.254
You feel me?

06:36.313 --> 06:37.814
KIERA:
This makes no sense.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.723
You realize this is
a ridiculous amount

06:40.818 --> 06:43.355
of packaging for
a very small device.
I mean,

06:43.487 --> 06:45.978
I mean,
no wonder you have
an excess trash problem.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.574
(CHUCKLES) Okay,
take it out of the box.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.525
Okay, I don't understand.

06:50.661 --> 06:51.741
Hold on a second.

06:51.829 --> 06:52.864
Explain it to me now.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.536
Okay, well,
I imagine the people

06:54.623 --> 06:55.738
in the coffee shop
are looking at you

06:55.833 --> 06:57.494
because you're
talking to yourself,
right?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.793
Yeah, / thought so.

07:02.006 --> 07:02.995
Put it in your ear.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.922
And there you go,
you've gone from
complete crazy person

07:10.014 --> 07:11.845
to legit yuppie
all in one move.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.533
Do you really
want all this blood
on your hands?

07:44.048 --> 07:45.379
What do you want?

07:46.216 --> 07:49.925
Two eggs scrambled,
sausage, biscuit
and hash browns, please.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.502
And tomatoes,
if they're fresh.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.971
Coffee, black.
Same thing for my friend,
thank you.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.597
God, I'm starving,
aren't you?

07:57.019 --> 07:58.134
I meant,
why are you here?

07:58.854 --> 07:59.889
I want to talk.

08:00.356 --> 08:01.391
That's it.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.399
Then I better like
what you have to say.
So get on with it.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.605
I want to protect my future,
and you want to protect yours.

08:12.076 --> 08:16.240
My comrades and I are from
two very different viewpoints
on the use of force.

08:16.747 --> 08:20.205
Would you believe me
if I told you that I don't
share their methods?

08:20.292 --> 08:21.327
No.

08:21.794 --> 08:22.909
Neither did the judge.

08:23.295 --> 08:26.037
I admit, what happened
was beyond forgiveness.

08:26.423 --> 08:30.086
It's ironic coming from
a man with alive grenade
in his hand.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.963
Why are you
telling me this?

08:32.054 --> 08:33.089
Why should I care?

08:33.472 --> 08:35.008
'Cause I can give you
something you want.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.636
An arrangement for
our mutual survival.

08:39.687 --> 08:43.771
You scratch my back,
and where my former
associates are concerned,

08:43.899 --> 08:45.139
I'll cover yours.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.391
What's in it for you?

08:47.486 --> 08:48.692
I like it here.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.311
I like the lifestyle,
you know.

08:51.490 --> 08:57.406
I like the variety and
availability of meats
and other goodies.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.369
I know it's all
going to change,

08:59.456 --> 09:01.196
but I'll probably
be dead by then.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.574
Do what you want
with the others.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.034
I don't care.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.870
Ijust want to live out
my life in this time.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.748
We're both
survivors, Officer.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.629
We're never
going to be allies,
but it may happen

09:13.762 --> 09:17.050
that from time to time
we both want the same thing.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.890
I'm looking for
situations that
are win-win.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.597
Oh, the local constabulary,
time for me to go.

09:26.984 --> 09:30.101
lllbeintouch.
Please don't,
uh, try to follow me.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.981
Damn, I was really hungry.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.315
Oh, sorry.
Excuse me.
No, please.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.577
Hey!

09:41.915 --> 09:43.121
Ready for the thing?

09:44.168 --> 09:45.157
Huh?

09:45.753 --> 09:47.664
Uh... Hello?

09:47.755 --> 09:48.915
You okay?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.838
Yeah, yeah.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.002
Oh. Thanks.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.302
lwas kidding...

10:07.399 --> 10:08.855
Hey, Clayton.
Hey.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.982
Uh, can't do it.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.479
Kiera Cameron, uh...

10:12.571 --> 10:15.028
Hi, uh, hi.
New partner.

10:15.157 --> 10:16.363
Nice to meet you.

10:16.492 --> 10:18.198
CARLOS: This him?
CLAYTON: Yes.

10:18.744 --> 10:20.860
Greg Doolin, 45.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.411
Someone bored a hole
into the back of his head

10:23.540 --> 10:24.791
about the width
of a golf ball.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.877
Cored his skull
like an apple.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.417
(CARLOS CLEARS THROAT)

10:29.546 --> 10:31.207
They removed
a section of
the lower cortex,

10:31.298 --> 10:32.708
right where it
meets with the spine.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.759
Yeah, exactly.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.125
Desanguination
indicates the victim

10:37.221 --> 10:38.882
was still alive
when the cut was made.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.963
The precision
of the removal

10:41.892 --> 10:44.554
suggests highly
advanced surgical skill.

10:44.645 --> 10:47.102
The wound appears
to be cauterized.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.392
Uh, yeah, like I said,
she's new.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.942
And she's right.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.813
Um, an instrument
that could make a cut

10:53.904 --> 10:55.440
with that kind of
precision doesn't exist.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.237
Are you
a medical professional?

10:57.616 --> 10:59.607
No, Ijust have
a hunch
our killer may be.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.443
Ah. So, are we done
with this one?

11:02.538 --> 11:04.745
As you can see,
the hits just
keep on coming.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.491
You think this could be
a member of our gang,
the,uh”.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.163
What's her name,
uh, Sonya, the medic?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.120
Well, this could
be any one of them.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.503
But if medical
skill is required,
she's the one providing it.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.465
How long do you
keep the dead?

11:22.599 --> 11:25.261
Weeks, sometimes months
if they go unclaimed.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.432
ls Jaworski still here?

11:26.812 --> 11:28.018
Uh,yeah.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.016
The body is evidence
in our investigation.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.472
Can you take me
to him, please?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.288
How much longer?

11:45.414 --> 11:48.247
The network security
of this decade
is a complete joke.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.081
Well, can you get it,
quickly?

11:52.754 --> 11:57.043
Somewhere,
a medical supplies warehouse
is accepting payment

11:57.134 --> 11:59.625
from a financial institution
that 40 years from now

11:59.720 --> 12:02.086
will epitomize everything
we're fighting against.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.260
So that's a yes?

12:06.310 --> 12:11.430
A Baker August 5000,
hospital grade.

12:11.607 --> 12:12.813
Where do you
want it delivered?

12:13.775 --> 12:14.855
Any house
on the street.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.100
We can intercept.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.400
KIERA:
What was done to him?

12:21.491 --> 12:24.983
His organs were
weighed and examined
as part of the autopsy.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.118
Just following
standard protocol.
Why?

12:27.205 --> 12:29.196
Did you find
something you
didn't expect?

12:29.291 --> 12:30.326
Uh, yes.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.745
In fact,
there were some structural

12:32.836 --> 12:35.122
abnormalities in his heart,
lungs and CNS.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.248
How did you know?

12:36.381 --> 12:37.917
That's not up
for discussion.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.999
Until you hear from me,
you need to
secure all evidence

12:40.093 --> 12:42.709
you have relating to
this man and
consider it classified.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.177
Classified?
KIERA: Yes.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.181
I'll arrange to
have it shipped
to a safe location.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.185
She's our expert
on this gang.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.184
Do what she says.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.144
Okay, understood.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.062
All right, thanks.
Talk to you soon.

12:55.192 --> 12:58.355
(STAMMERING)
Did you want to see
the other body?

13:00.030 --> 13:01.019
What other body?

13:02.783 --> 13:04.444
CLAYTON:
Meet Brian Young.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.740
Came in yesterday.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.526
This changes things.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.240
Uh-huh, it sure does.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.327
Pattern killing,
ritualistic mutilation.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.834
(SIGHS)
Mr. Young yesterday
and Mr. Doolin today.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.879
I took the liberty
of cross-referencing
both victims

13:18.966 --> 13:20.126
through all
the crime databases.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.423
Came up with nothing.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.961
So there's no
apparent connection
between the victims.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.720
If that holds up,
we could be dealing
with a serial killer.

13:27.808 --> 13:28.968
There is one connection.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.139
Yeah, what's that?

13:30.560 --> 13:31.686
What's missing.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.852
We need to find
out what exactly
is being extracted

13:33.939 --> 13:34.974
from our victims.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.147
Talkto the ME.

13:38.777 --> 13:41.109
In both cases
the pituitary gland
was extracted

13:41.196 --> 13:43.107
while the victim
was alive.
Alive?

13:43.198 --> 13:46.406
As best as we can guess
from the physiology
of the wounds.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.700
What does it do,
this gland?

13:49.246 --> 13:51.988
It's an endocrine gland
that produces many hormones,

13:52.082 --> 13:55.119
but my guess is
your suspect was after
human growth hormone.

13:55.836 --> 13:56.951
They're harvesting it.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.660
Excuse me?
Harvesting?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.040
That's my guess also.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.798
Believe it or not,
this stuff has value
on the black market.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.045
Really?
For who?

14:04.136 --> 14:05.216
How much?

14:05.387 --> 14:06.467
Athletes mostly.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.295
Coaches.
And it's expensive.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.010
Was there any reason
that these two men
in particular

14:11.101 --> 14:12.591
were targeted
for the harvesting?

14:12.686 --> 14:14.096
Anything linking
them chemically?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.347
Not that I can see.

14:15.439 --> 14:16.599
Blood type is different.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.855
I'll need to run
some more lab tests
to be sure,

14:18.942 --> 14:20.603
but it could take weeks
if I don't know
what to look for.

14:20.694 --> 14:21.683
We don't have weeks.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.279
I need to know
what to look for.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.604
Let's go.
Yeah, okay.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.900
Look, just run any
tests that come to mind

14:28.994 --> 14:30.279
and call me if
you find anything.

14:31.455 --> 14:32.786
All right,
what's next?

14:32.873 --> 14:36.707
Find the connection
between our victims that
no one has noticed yet.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.412
KIERA: Nothing?

14:42.799 --> 14:46.291
(SIGHS) No.
No common friends,
no business interests,

14:46.595 --> 14:47.630
two completely
different worlds.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.799
There's nothing,
in any database
linking the two vics.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.255
Maybe my contacts
can help?

14:52.809 --> 14:55.016
Your people with the answers
nobody else seems to know.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.902
(CLEARS THROAT)
I need a database search.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.104
It doesn’t work that way.

15:07.783 --> 15:08.818
What?

15:09.326 --> 15:10.691
You didn't dial anyone.

15:15.832 --> 15:16.867
Told ya.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.167
I need a search.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.999
Oh, my God,
you're really missing
the point of this thing.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.373
Okay, it's coming right up.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.671
(BUZZING) Uh...

15:28.845 --> 15:30.221
I have to call you
right back.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.214
Hey, Julian.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.682
Hey, your mom asked me
to come and get you.
E veryone’s here.

15:35.769 --> 15:36.849
Okay then.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.475
Alec?

15:38.563 --> 15:39.848
Yeah, I'm coming.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.435
Come on, dude,
everyone’s here.
Let’s go.

15:42.692 --> 15:43.681
KIERA: Uh...

15:44.402 --> 15:45.778
Hello?

15:46.696 --> 15:47.776
Hello?

15:49.407 --> 15:52.490
It's nice to know
even the government
drops calls.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.614
Just wait till
the phone company
is the government.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.241
Ooh...
That's a scary thought.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.785
As long as we are dependent
to the corporations

16:02.879 --> 16:05.586
for their
food-growing technologies,
we become slaves

16:05.674 --> 16:08.962
to those who
would use technology
to enslave us.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.334
And the forces that control
our lives are counting

16:11.429 --> 16:13.135
on that same
fascination with
technology.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.135
They know. They know.
They market it to us.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.636
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

16:41.585 --> 16:42.620
How is he?

16:43.420 --> 16:44.580
Alive.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.377
Unlike some
people around here.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.914
Is that supposed to be
some kind of a threat?

16:49.009 --> 16:50.169
Yeah.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.106
What was Kellog on about?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.948
Kellog has always been

17:15.952 --> 17:17.032
different.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.244
He's up to something.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.864
He's always breaking
ranks on us.

17:22.292 --> 17:23.953
Sneaking out on his own.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.754
What do you suggest?

17:28.298 --> 17:30.664
What would you do if
you were in my shoes?

17:33.803 --> 17:35.259
Take him out.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.679
And violate our oath
we swore to each other?

17:37.807 --> 17:39.763
Before he has a chance
to make a play.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.976
I'm just thinking
about you, Travis.

17:58.328 --> 17:59.943
Do you mind if I...

18:00.038 --> 18:02.495
Just for a sec,
real quick.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.032
Thank you.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.326
INGRAM:
What are you doing?

18:10.840 --> 18:12.216
What are you
up to, Kellog?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.708
You know that lady Protector
that came back with us?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.129
What about her?

18:16.221 --> 18:17.836
I'm setting that bitch up.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.014
Mom?

18:22.102 --> 18:24.343
I'm Just gonna head back
out to the barn to work.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.268
Okay.
Wait, wait, Mom, here.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.013
Let me help you
with that.
Oh.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.350
Thank you, sweetheart.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:32.487 --> 18:33.727
Okay.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.987
Mom, why are you
always in here alone
cleaning up after people?

18:40.078 --> 18:41.739
It's no bother.
I'm happy to.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.537
Why can't Roland,
or Julian do it?
It's their group.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.791
Don't tell me they
converted you too.
(CHUCKLES)

18:47.877 --> 18:49.083
Honey.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.960
I realize that it's
asking a lot of you

18:55.051 --> 18:57.542
to listen to your stepfather
and his beliefs, okay?

18:57.637 --> 19:00.094
But that is all
I'm asking you to do,
is just listen.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.506
Nobody is
expecting you to change

19:02.600 --> 19:04.181
the way you live,
or stop your work.

19:04.269 --> 19:05.304
He's so full of crap.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.353
He has his beliefs,
honey, as we all do.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.813
If you want him
to respect yours,

19:10.900 --> 19:12.686
then you have to
respect his, right?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.811
There's a very
good man in there

19:15.905 --> 19:17.520
who is trying to
reach out to you.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.233
(SIGHS) Okay, well...

19:21.828 --> 19:24.820
I'll really try hard, Mom.
For you. (CHUCKLES)

19:29.586 --> 19:33.078
I don't understand
how you find anything
with this antiquated system.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.419
Well, we can't all
have unlimited budgets
like some people,

19:36.551 --> 19:38.337
or there'd be no
inter-agencyjealousy.

19:38.428 --> 19:39.417
SADLER:
Okay, I’m back.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.501
ExceHent

19:41.264 --> 19:42.800
What's excellent?

19:42.932 --> 19:43.967
The work you're doing.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.552
What are you talking about?
I've got nothing.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.064
Sperm?

19:50.482 --> 19:52.143
Sperm?
Sperm?

19:52.275 --> 19:54.561
I'm sending it now.
They both were paid
a couple hundred bucks

19:54.652 --> 19:55.903
by the same
fertility clinic.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.103
It's a sperm bank
south of downtown.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.814
South Creek
Fertility Services.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.322
Huh.
How'd you come up
with that?

20:05.455 --> 20:06.740
Look!

20:06.956 --> 20:09.413
They're both listed
as receiving payment.

20:10.794 --> 20:11.783
Sperm.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.883
Are you Dr. Gibson?
We need a word.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.585
Detective Fonnegra, VPD.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.012
You'll have to
schedule an appointment
with my secretary.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.392
This will just
take a second.

20:26.476 --> 20:29.183
Look, we need access
to your client database.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.683
Absolutely not,
those records
are confidential.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.650
Now, ifyou’l/
excuse me...

20:35.693 --> 20:36.899
KIERA: Alec?

20:37.195 --> 20:39.231
Dr. Ted Gibson,
I'm on it.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.480
All right.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.662
You are gonna love this.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.868
CARLOS: I understand
where you are coming from,

20:54.963 --> 20:56.328
but I've got two bodies
in the morgue

20:56.423 --> 20:58.630
with holes drilled into
the back of their skulls.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.093
The only connection
between the two of them
is you.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.919
Ifyou're suggesting
I had anything to do
with any murders,

21:04.013 --> 21:05.674
you should be
talking to my lawyers.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.801
We're not
suggesting you had anything
to do with the murders.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.223
Ifyou'll just give us
a second, we'll explain.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.925
Let me explain to you.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.390
I'm not the kind of man
who appreciates
being accosted

21:13.481 --> 21:15.517
by police officers who
seem to have forgotten

21:15.608 --> 21:18.350
a little right
called doctor-patient
confidentiality.

21:18.445 --> 21:22.063
That didn't seem to
bother you in 2002,
Seattle, I believe itwas,

21:22.157 --> 21:24.773
when you released the names
of your "premium" donors

21:24.868 --> 21:28.781
to some of your patients
and then charged
extra for their services.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.749
How much does
the sperm from a Nobel Prize
runner-up go for these days?

21:34.836 --> 21:37.293
That case was settled.
The records are sealed.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.790
How did you find
out about that?

21:39.174 --> 21:40.505
She has her sources.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.920
Okay.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.049
Thanks.
Hey.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.559
Like what you're
doing with your hair.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.140
CARLOS: Great.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.391
So?

21:56.691 --> 21:58.147
Well, the records
are on the way.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.353
What's the point?

21:59.694 --> 22:02.060
Well, ifthe killer
used the clinic database
to find his victims,

22:02.155 --> 22:03.736
there should be
a link to their records.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.231
Which means that hopefully
we'll be able to
identify the next victim

22:06.326 --> 22:07.566
before another murder.

22:07.869 --> 22:08.904
Good.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.902
I'm looking for
Detective Fonnegra.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.069
Yeah, right here.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.074
Uh, we've got the files
from the fertility clinic.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.325
That was fast.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.330
Are they on
a jump drive
or on CDs?

22:18.421 --> 22:21.037
We've got 45 of these babies
down in the truck.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.925
Where do you want them?

22:27.430 --> 22:31.423
Forty-five of
these babies!
(LAUGHING)

22:36.648 --> 22:37.728
(SIGHS)

22:38.274 --> 22:41.937
These files don't indicate
any commonalities
between the two victims.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.271
(YAWNING)

22:47.408 --> 22:48.909
What are you
looking for?

22:49.285 --> 22:51.697
We need to
isolate their matching
genetic marker.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.449
SADLER:
All right, give me a sec.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.998
Hey, here we go.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.663
Both men have
an identical chromosome

22:59.796 --> 23:01.286
that's tied to
pituitary mutation.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.538
Both victims have
an identical chromosome

23:03.633 --> 23:05.669
that's tied to
pituitary mutation.

23:06.553 --> 23:10.796
It's dormant here,
but the kind of thing
that could be triggered.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.966
What is that?
And how do you
even know about it?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.392
With the right equipment,
this natural hormone

23:16.479 --> 23:19.141
can be synthesized
into a powerful
metabolic drug.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.479
What, like a steroid?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.478
Yeah, like a super steroid.

23:24.487 --> 23:28.321
The kind of thing that
the military might use
to build a better soldier.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.317
So these guys
need this steroid?

23:32.412 --> 23:33.652
Have you checked
for a military program

23:33.746 --> 23:35.657
with a profile
that matches this one?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.079
Not yet.
Okay.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.997
Let's get on it.
Yeah.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.293
Okay,

was gonna be easy.

40:41.523 --> 40:42.683
So what now?

40:43.358 --> 40:44.473
We're both adults.

40:44.568 --> 40:45.683
The house is empty...

40:46.612 --> 40:48.068
(CHUCKLES)

40:49.031 --> 40:50.066
Or not.

40:51.450 --> 40:54.066
You could arrest me I suppose,
but I can't help you
from a prison cell.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.533
You can't hurt me
from one either.

40:55.621 --> 40:58.863
I have no
intention of hurting you.
Quite the opposite.

41:00.292 --> 41:01.407
Untie me.

41:03.462 --> 41:05.293
Give me
one good reason.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.995
Look, I know how
these animals think.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.832
I can help you
protect innocent people
who might get in their way.

41:09.926 --> 41:11.587
That's yourjob,
isn't it?

41:11.678 --> 41:13.760
You are a terrorist
and a revolutionary.

41:13.847 --> 41:15.007
What? No, no.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.884
That guy won't
be born till 2041.

41:18.060 --> 41:21.393
I'm a guy with a bad future,
ready for a fresh start.

41:24.107 --> 41:26.098
What do you got to lose?

41:33.909 --> 41:37.652
You mess with me now
and lwill not only kill you
in this time,

41:37.746 --> 41:40.032
but I will make it my
mission to guarantee

41:40.165 --> 41:42.451
that you are never
born in the future.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.157
We clear?
Absolutely.

41:53.762 --> 41:54.797
(BEEPING)

41:59.518 --> 42:00.598
What's happening?

42:00.686 --> 42:01.721
We got her.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.177
We got the Queen of hearts.

42:04.773 --> 42:07.185
CPS LEADER: Tag and ship
this waste of space.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.237
(BEEPING)

42:17.828 --> 42:18.988
Run!

42:44.312 --> 42:45.973
(PANTING)

42:50.986 --> 42:53.819
How can you be so sure
the gang won't still need
victims for their serum?

42:53.947 --> 42:57.155
Kellog told me
they synthesized enough
to last indefinitely.

42:57.325 --> 42:58.576
Can you trust him?

42:59.119 --> 43:00.404
Probably not.

43:00.495 --> 43:03.578
But the fact that
his own gang just tried
to blow him up

43:03.665 --> 43:06.873
makes me feel a little better
about the situation.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.328
Wait. What are you doing?
You could get into trouble.

43:13.508 --> 43:16.124
It's only a matter of time
before those two bodies
in the morgue

43:16.219 --> 43:17.470
start raising questions.

43:17.679 --> 43:18.919
If I'm ever
going to get home,

43:19.014 --> 43:21.847
the last thing I need
is a trail that leads here.

43:32.861 --> 43:34.226
A girl's gotta
have secrets.
