11:14.992 --> 11:17.219
We have the entire place
booked for ourselves, so...

11:17.243 --> 11:21.551
Well... not exactly the whole place.

11:21.576 --> 11:23.975
What do you mean, not
exactly the whole place?

11:24.890 --> 11:26.545
I told the women

11:26.570 --> 11:29.524
that they could also use the
saloon for their party.

11:29.549 --> 11:30.937
[MEN GROAN]

11:30.962 --> 11:33.265
Hold on. You said that they
could share the space with us?

11:33.290 --> 11:35.578
I mean, I-I don't know much
about bachelor parties,

11:35.603 --> 11:37.636
<i>but what I do know is that
women aren't allowed.</i>

11:37.661 --> 11:38.718
Nathan, I uh...

11:38.743 --> 11:41.303
No, Bill, it's fine. Let
him make his point.

11:41.328 --> 11:43.781
<i>Thank you.</i> I think the best
thing to do is tell them

11:43.806 --> 11:45.460
you double booked the
saloon, you're sorry

11:45.485 --> 11:47.123
but they're gonna have
to find another venue

11:47.148 --> 11:49.554
for their bridal shower.

11:49.785 --> 11:51.500
Or the men could vacate.

11:52.418 --> 11:56.175
And it isn't a bridal shower,
it's a bachelorette party.

11:57.233 --> 11:58.838
<i>I just have a few last minute menu items</i>

11:58.863 --> 12:00.462
to go over with Gustave, is he around?

12:00.487 --> 12:01.552
He's in the back.

12:01.577 --> 12:02.806
Thank you, Lucas.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.218
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

12:04.243 --> 12:06.780
You're giving the women
half of the saloon

12:06.805 --> 12:08.343
and now Gustave as well?

12:08.368 --> 12:11.108
I figured he could
cook for both parties.

12:11.133 --> 12:14.109
No. I'll handle the cooking.

12:15.055 --> 12:16.688
But I'm gonna need some help.

12:16.713 --> 12:18.155
Oooh.

12:21.521 --> 12:22.797
Nathan. Good.

12:22.822 --> 12:23.985
Why?

12:24.087 --> 12:25.665
I'll make my famous ribs.

12:25.722 --> 12:27.956
Let's see Gustave beat that.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.603
Just got off the phone with Faith.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.028
She says hello.

12:36.053 --> 12:37.686
How is she enjoying Chicago?

12:37.779 --> 12:41.221
Loving her studies but missing home.

12:41.750 --> 12:44.316
Well, you're visiting her soon.
That should do the trick.

12:44.341 --> 12:46.225
You have six patients waiting.

12:46.335 --> 12:48.635
Six? I don't-I don't see anybody.

12:48.660 --> 12:50.091
Oh, I have a system.

12:50.116 --> 12:51.482
I send them over to the cafe

12:51.507 --> 12:54.358
and ask that they come back
in 15-minute increments.

12:54.427 --> 12:55.827
Fifteen minutes?

12:55.926 --> 12:57.225
Oh, right on time.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.529
The doctor will be with you momentarily.

13:02.171 --> 13:05.411
As much as I appreciate you
taking the initiative here

13:05.658 --> 13:07.412
I don't like to be rushed.

13:08.342 --> 13:11.610
Fifteen minutes isn't enough
time between patients for me.

13:11.701 --> 13:14.962
Well, not if you're gonna
waste all this time chatting.

13:17.039 --> 13:18.405
Right.

13:18.550 --> 13:20.184
Right this way.

13:24.949 --> 13:27.265
Look at that.

13:27.633 --> 13:28.893
Ohhh.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.982
Oh, they're beautiful.

13:37.606 --> 13:39.237
No note.

13:48.356 --> 13:50.556
Do you think we should start
looking for a new pastor?

13:50.911 --> 13:52.308
I don't know what's holding him up.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.299
He was supposed to be here a week ago.

13:54.490 --> 13:55.917
I'll send him a wire today.

13:55.942 --> 13:56.947
There.

13:56.972 --> 13:58.208
Nice flowers.

14:00.094 --> 14:01.968
Thank... you.

14:07.199 --> 14:09.849
Someone left them on my
doorstep this morning.

14:10.230 --> 14:12.018
How do you feel about that?

14:12.254 --> 14:13.950
I don't know how I feel about that.

14:13.975 --> 14:15.773
I don't even know where they're from.

14:16.137 --> 14:17.536
Really?

14:17.618 --> 14:19.485
Yes. Really.

14:22.317 --> 14:24.184
Well, who do you hope they're from?

14:24.209 --> 14:25.224
- Bill.
- I mean,

14:25.249 --> 14:26.558
if this were an investigation

14:26.583 --> 14:28.619
there'd really only be two suspects.

14:28.684 --> 14:32.372
Well, luckily this is
not an investigation.

14:32.451 --> 14:34.085
I can find out. It wouldn't be hard.

14:34.110 --> 14:35.442
That's not necessary.

14:35.467 --> 14:37.586
- Let you know by tonight...
- Bill.

14:40.515 --> 14:42.173
Good job.

14:45.999 --> 14:48.633
Ok. Let's have a look.

14:48.739 --> 14:50.105
Open wide.

14:50.198 --> 14:51.643
<i>Say "ah".</i>

14:52.788 --> 14:54.690
[WHISPERS] How's your
first day on the job?

14:54.762 --> 14:56.396
Oh, fine.

14:56.421 --> 14:57.753
Who's watching the telephone?

14:57.778 --> 15:00.645
Oh, it's been slow today.
Ned can handle it.

15:00.864 --> 15:05.030
Besides, it's not every day
someone starts a new...

15:05.286 --> 15:06.785
what're you reading there?

15:06.859 --> 15:09.525
Doctor Shepherd's medical text.
Look at this.

15:09.577 --> 15:11.877
It says a common symptom of meningitis

15:11.902 --> 15:13.683
is cold hands and feet. I have that.

15:13.708 --> 15:16.557
Molly. Your hands are cold
in the middle of summer.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.635
I wouldn't be worrying about that.

15:18.660 --> 15:19.706
- Well...
- Ok, great.

15:19.731 --> 15:21.436
Just remember to gargle with salt water

15:21.461 --> 15:23.382
<i>and that should help
with the sore throat.</i>

15:25.752 --> 15:27.178
Bye-bye.

<i>(ROSEMARY) I think Clara's going

But It doesn't sound good.

the hit of the party.

16:03.174 --> 16:07.016
Well, I hear Gustave is
making braised lamb.

16:07.243 --> 16:08.337
Is that right?

16:08.362 --> 16:09.404
Yeah.

16:09.429 --> 16:11.806
You're supposed to mince the garlic.

16:12.533 --> 16:14.642
I thought you said you know how to cook.

16:15.197 --> 16:17.311
Well, Allie doesn't complain.

16:17.835 --> 16:20.481
Although she's been offering
to cook a lot more lately.

16:20.926 --> 16:23.066
I was at Elizabeth's earlier today.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.945
There was this big bouquet
of flowers on her table.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.279
Somebody left them at her
front door, no card.

16:29.101 --> 16:32.086
Uh... somebody...
somebody got her flowers?

16:32.466 --> 16:35.120
Yeah. Thought you might
know something about it.

16:37.443 --> 16:40.166
Did she-did she like them?

16:41.081 --> 16:42.878
You could say that.

16:50.707 --> 16:51.846
Hi, Molly.

16:51.871 --> 16:53.179
Elizabeth.

16:53.298 --> 16:54.472
Well?

16:58.463 --> 17:01.667
Oh, I'm so sorry! Your job!
Congratulations.

17:01.725 --> 17:04.107
Oh, thank you. But no, not that.

17:06.223 --> 17:07.569
The flowers.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.082
How did you hear about that?

17:12.107 --> 17:14.117
Oh, I saw them on your front step.

17:14.631 --> 17:16.464
<i>So, who are they from?</i>

17:16.634 --> 17:19.334
Uh, well, to be honest I don't know.

17:19.358 --> 17:20.625
<i>There wasn't any card.</i>

17:20.694 --> 17:23.419
<i>Really? A secret admirer.</i>

17:23.973 --> 17:25.628
How fun.

17:27.487 --> 17:28.789
Well, I should go.

17:28.814 --> 17:29.826
<i>Of course.</i>

17:29.851 --> 17:32.040
- <i>Good afternoon.</i>
- Bye.

17:35.267 --> 17:36.990
Must have been that
pothole I drove through

17:37.015 --> 17:38.850
back in Benson Hills.

17:39.331 --> 17:41.644
You don't know anything
about cars, do you?

17:41.946 --> 17:43.856
Surely you jest.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.209
I thought you could fix anything.

17:46.364 --> 17:49.445
Hunh! Only if it has a
hand set and a ringer.

17:49.470 --> 17:51.069
Oh, I feel terrible.

17:51.206 --> 17:53.574
I'm late for Clara's fitting.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.233
And you would have made it on time

17:55.258 --> 17:58.037
had we not been stuck
here for over an hour.

17:59.622 --> 18:02.082
<i>(ROSEMARY) I think this
is Jed Campbell's land.</i>

18:02.143 --> 18:03.416
Hmm?

18:05.178 --> 18:07.111
Wait, Rosemary.

18:07.415 --> 18:08.780
Where are you going?

18:08.825 --> 18:11.007
Getting us a ride!

18:33.953 --> 18:35.449
You are late.

18:35.523 --> 18:37.023
I'm sorry, I was with Judge Avery.

18:37.066 --> 18:39.620
There was a problem with the food.

18:39.758 --> 18:41.038
Come on.

18:41.631 --> 18:43.664
I saw Mrs. Thornton earlier.

18:43.770 --> 18:47.461
She really liked those flowers
that someone left on her door.

18:47.486 --> 18:48.498
Did she?

18:48.523 --> 18:49.838
Mmmhmm.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.924
Did she say anything else?

18:53.682 --> 18:54.915
Nope.

18:54.965 --> 18:56.345
Nothing?

18:57.037 --> 18:59.264
Anything you wanna tell me?

19:01.202 --> 19:02.725
No.

19:10.050 --> 19:11.552
What can I get you, Bill?

19:11.577 --> 19:12.630
Oh, nothing for me.

19:12.655 --> 19:14.696
I just wanted to stop by
and check on the beverages

19:14.721 --> 19:15.928
for the party.

19:15.953 --> 19:18.120
Everything in stock, ready to go?

19:18.246 --> 19:20.411
Nothing's changed since
you checked this morning.

19:20.558 --> 19:21.891
Oh, right.

19:21.995 --> 19:27.041
You know, I notice that you
don't put out flowers.

19:28.990 --> 19:31.546
Are you a fan? Of flowers?

19:32.188 --> 19:34.048
As much as the next man.

19:34.402 --> 19:35.702
I was at Elizabeth's this morning

19:35.727 --> 19:38.060
and she had this beautiful
bouquet on her table.

19:38.085 --> 19:39.117
Quite stunning.

19:39.142 --> 19:40.375
Is that right?

19:40.471 --> 19:42.071
Somebody left them at the door.

19:42.096 --> 19:44.096
No card, no tag.

19:46.175 --> 19:47.730
Interesting.

19:47.909 --> 19:49.074
Did she like them?

19:49.099 --> 19:50.816
Very much.

19:51.429 --> 19:53.485
Any idea who might have left them?

19:54.893 --> 19:56.321
I really couldn't say.

19:56.509 --> 20:00.116
You couldn't say or you don't know?

20:02.124 --> 20:04.997
I don't know what's
taking Rosemary so long.

20:05.214 --> 20:06.873
I bet she ran into Henry.

20:07.088 --> 20:10.188
Just tell him the truth.
He'll understand.

20:10.303 --> 20:12.534
This is Henry Gowen we're
talking about here.

20:12.559 --> 20:14.590
He loves this car.

20:16.026 --> 20:17.977
You don't know anything
about cars, do you?

20:18.002 --> 20:21.472
I prefer transportation of
the four-legged variety.

20:21.527 --> 20:24.515
The coast is clear!
Henry's in his office.

20:26.148 --> 20:29.371
I'm sorry to flee the scene of the crime

20:29.396 --> 20:31.522
but the bride waits!

20:31.782 --> 20:35.526
Of course. I'll figure this out.

20:37.144 --> 20:38.738
Let's pull it to the livery.

20:38.763 --> 20:41.033
Kevin won't mind. Come on, let's go.

20:42.205 --> 20:43.652
Oh, Elizabeth, I'm so sorry.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.581
Is Clara still here?

20:45.606 --> 20:46.667
<i>In here!</i>

20:46.692 --> 20:47.958
She's just trying it on.

20:47.983 --> 20:51.019
Clara, I am so sorry I am
late, it's a long story,

20:51.044 --> 20:54.922
but the bottom line is I got the
lace and it's absolutely...

20:56.266 --> 20:58.257
Oh, perfect.

21:05.452 --> 21:08.560
Exactly how long am I going
to be your accomplice?

21:08.710 --> 21:11.146
As soon as we fix it
I'll be out of your way.

21:11.390 --> 21:12.815
"We"?

21:13.219 --> 21:15.086
I don't know the first thing about cars.

21:15.193 --> 21:16.526
I thought you might.

21:16.830 --> 21:18.779
Because I'm a blacksmith?

21:19.174 --> 21:21.239
Because you seem like a smart guy.

21:21.693 --> 21:25.368
Well, I mean, maybe I could help.

21:29.031 --> 21:31.007
Thank you, Molly. You sure to work?

21:31.032 --> 21:32.493
Like a charm.

21:33.723 --> 21:34.956
Are you alright?

21:34.993 --> 21:38.210
Chills. I may have meningitis. Or worse.

21:38.478 --> 21:39.705
Well, that doesn't sound good.

21:39.730 --> 21:41.162
No, it doesn't.

21:42.933 --> 21:44.032
Feel better.

21:44.068 --> 21:45.388
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:46.010 --> 21:48.058
Where's Mike going? He
has an appointment.

21:48.418 --> 21:49.961
He just had a sore throat.

21:49.986 --> 21:51.895
I told him to gargle with salt water.

21:56.643 --> 21:59.593
How about a second tart? I
know Laura loves those.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.237
Aw, that's so sweet.

22:01.516 --> 22:02.982
I'm surprised you're still here.

22:03.007 --> 22:05.162
I would think you'd be getting
ready for your big party.

22:05.187 --> 22:07.599
Oh, well, Bill's running late.

22:07.624 --> 22:10.742
He said he had some
last-minute work to do.

22:10.809 --> 22:12.249
<i>(CLARA) Oh, there he is.</i>

22:12.274 --> 22:15.929
Ah, just the person
I've been looking for.

22:16.061 --> 22:19.611
I have been working on
your little surprise.

22:19.636 --> 22:21.203
Ooh, what surprise?

22:21.228 --> 22:22.383
Elizabeth had...

22:22.408 --> 22:27.431
I was hoping to surprise
little Jack with a... a cake.

22:27.839 --> 22:30.808
And Bill offered to bake me one.

22:31.068 --> 22:33.625
But I have assured him that
I am more than capable

22:33.650 --> 22:36.578
of baking my own cake.

22:36.788 --> 22:39.348
Are you sure? I really don't mind.

well, Molly, I can help you.

just go home to rest.

you, I appreciate that.
