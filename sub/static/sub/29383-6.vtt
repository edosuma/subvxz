12:59.735 --> 13:01.389
We didn't know each other

13:01.432 --> 13:03.086

two people together forever.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.049
Hmm.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.051
And Brooke,
she always seemed so sweet.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.880
I never thought she'd be capableof such brutality.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.491
Well, people have ways
of surprising us.

13:16.534 --> 13:19.276
But... we're safe now.

she can't hurt anyone again.

Okay, how long do I have
till the cops show up?

13:40.384 --> 13:42.473
They're not coming.
I wanted to call them.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.780
The thought of Brooke
taking the fall

13:44.824 --> 13:46.477
for your crimes sickens me.

13:46.521 --> 13:49.089
But then I played it out
in my head.

13:49.132 --> 13:52.048
If I come forward
there will be a trial.

13:52.092 --> 13:55.051
And you have an army of lawyers

13:55.095 --> 13:57.010
and a fortune
at your disposal. Me...

13:57.053 --> 13:59.577

13:59.621 --> 14:02.232
The only way I can make it now

14:02.276 --> 14:04.931

14:04.974 --> 14:08.021
Oh. Okay,

There's only one way

14:22.992 --> 14:25.821
I'm... blackmailing you,
Margaret.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.084
Why would you want to marry me?

14:28.128 --> 14:30.260
Because, darling...

14:46.320 --> 14:49.497

15:10.997 --> 15:13.086
This kind of news cannot wait.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.957
What kind of assistant
would I be

15:15.001 --> 15:17.177
if I didn't zip over
the minute I heard?

15:17.220 --> 15:18.134
Heard what?

15:18.178 --> 15:20.441
Brooke Thompson has lost
her last appeal.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.225
She's gonna be executed.

15:31.452 --> 15:34.411
WARDEN:
I want to welcome you
to San Quentin State Prison.

15:34.455 --> 15:37.023
For the next ten days,
while you are in my charge,

15:37.066 --> 15:39.199
you will be kept safe
and comfortable,

15:39.242 --> 15:41.984
as much as a prison will allow,

15:42.028 --> 15:44.813
until the time
you are released in death.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.946
Do you have any questions?

15:48.208 --> 15:50.079
You're quiet.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.254
That's good.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.865
Keep it that way.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.184
-MAN: Shut up!

16:10.839 --> 16:14.016
I knew we'd see
each other again.

16:14.060 --> 16:18.064
You should've let me kill you
that night in your apartment.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.196
Would've saved everyone
a lot of trouble.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.157
But now you're where you belong.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.159
Montana would be happy.

16:26.202 --> 16:29.118
I gutted that bitch
from the inside out,

16:29.162 --> 16:32.339
and now she's in hell
licking Satan's balls.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.298
She should be so lucky!

16:37.648 --> 16:39.824
What's with all this fleece?

16:39.868 --> 16:42.044
Ooh. Hey.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.481
-Is this a good look for me?
-Yeah.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.092
If you're going
for "sad soccer mom."

16:46.135 --> 16:47.093
Fuck you.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.269
RAY:
Goddamn it, Montana!

16:49.312 --> 16:51.314
-Here comes Cranky Pants.
-There's a dead body
on the dock,

16:51.358 --> 16:53.273
rotting
in broad fucking daylight!

16:53.316 --> 16:55.884
Chill. Just clean it up
like you always do.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.668
No, you can't kill
every single person

16:57.712 --> 16:59.192
that wanders through here.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.236
-Yes, I can.
-Yeah. She can.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.195
There are no rules for the dead.

17:02.238 --> 17:05.154
You don't know that; you don't
know why we're stuck here.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.634
XAVIER:
No one does, Ray.

17:06.677 --> 17:09.332
But you know what I realized?
Nothing we do matters.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.466
When I was alive,in the last moments of my life,

17:12.509 --> 17:14.946
I tried everything
I could to be good.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.166
I tried to save Bertie.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.472
I fucking saved Margaret.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.082
And she killed me.

17:20.126 --> 17:23.303
And now Ikill people.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.956
-And guess what.
-What?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.480
Nothing happens.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.134
Being good got me nowhere,

17:28.177 --> 17:30.310
but being bad feels really good.

17:30.353 --> 17:33.313
So you and the old-timersand the entire fucking universe

17:33.356 --> 17:35.315
can suck it.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.360
MONTANA:
Holy shit.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.579
Look.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.581
RAY :
Oh, my God.

17:40.624 --> 17:43.366
The bitch is
finally gonna get hers.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.413
"Convicted on 11 counts
of first-degree murder"?

17:48.241 --> 17:51.374
This can't be.
She didn't do anything wrong.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.333
She killed me, Ray.

17:53.376 --> 17:54.551
Wasn't that wrong?

17:54.595 --> 17:57.467
-That was wrong, Ray.
-Yeah. Ray.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.165
WOMAN:
Dustin, you back?

18:00.209 --> 18:02.429
Hey! Hello!

18:03.865 --> 18:06.259
Okay, uh, who are you?
Where's Dustin?

18:06.302 --> 18:08.130
I don't know who that is.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.262
Um...

18:09.305 --> 18:10.480
I was just...

18:10.524 --> 18:13.266
uh, hiking around,
and I saw your newspaper.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.832
Sorry. Just let me explain.

18:14.876 --> 18:17.139
See, you see the woman
on the front page here?

18:17.183 --> 18:20.403
Brooke Thompson.
She's my friend.

18:20.447 --> 18:21.752
You're friends
with a serial killer?

18:21.796 --> 18:23.537
Don't listen to him.
He's delusional.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.060
Stay out of this!

18:26.322 --> 18:28.194
Where-Where's...?

18:28.237 --> 18:29.586
XAVIER:
Bye, bitch.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.328
No!

18:35.331 --> 18:36.985
That's it.

18:37.028 --> 18:40.336
I'm done cleaning up
after you assholes!

18:59.268 --> 19:01.444
RAMIREZ:
Electric chair.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.403
That's how I'd want to go,

19:03.446 --> 19:06.232
if they give me a choice.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.190
Bolts of lightning

19:08.234 --> 19:09.539
shattering through my body.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.194
That's rock and roll.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.240
But lethal injection?

19:14.283 --> 19:16.329
That one's no fun.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.853
Sounds like just one shot.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.899
But no.

19:21.943 --> 19:24.293
They inject
the anesthetic first.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.339
Makes you lose consciousness.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.079
So they say.
Doesn't always take.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.908
Then the paralytic,

19:30.952 --> 19:32.475
my personal favorite.

19:32.519 --> 19:36.349
Makes your lungs stop working, but your heart

19:36.392 --> 19:38.655
keeps beating, which means

19:38.699 --> 19:41.223
you're still alive.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.572
But you can't move

19:42.616 --> 19:45.445
because no one
wants to see you writhing

19:45.488 --> 19:48.317
from the pain
of the last injection.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.885
Potassium chloride.

19:50.928 --> 19:53.322
Odorless.

19:53.366 --> 19:55.803
Colorless.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.500
Liquid fire.

19:57.544 --> 20:00.460
It burns through your veins.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.506
They say sedation
makes it more humane.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.249
So you won't suffer.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.338
That's a lie.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.820
It will burn

20:12.863 --> 20:16.040
and snake through your body

20:16.084 --> 20:19.348
until it gets to your heart
and stops it.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.350
Forever.

20:22.351 --> 20:24.266
Unless you have my help.

20:24.310 --> 20:28.052
My master thinks
you have potential.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.054
He can protect you.

20:30.098 --> 20:31.926
Even from death.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.842
All you have to do

20:34.885 --> 20:36.887
is say yes.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.771
Fuck off.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.515
VOICES :
Satan. Satan. Satan.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.654
COURTNEY:
Did you push enter? I loaded

21:04.698 --> 21:06.656
the file onto the floppy
this morning.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.355
Over a thousand dollars for
this thing, and it is useless!

21:09.398 --> 21:10.965
Just give me the report
the old-fashioned way.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.359
-Come on, come on.
-These are...

21:13.402 --> 21:16.318
the first quarter numbers
on the Lizzie Borden house.

21:16.362 --> 21:19.713
Five times over expectations.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.455
Well, maybe over the board's
expectations but not mine.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.152
I told them, this house

21:24.195 --> 21:26.154
is in the most charming part
of Fall River.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.330
Let's turn it into
a high-end bed-and-breakfast

21:28.374 --> 21:30.332
just like the one
on CBS's Newhart.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.942
But at night

21:31.986 --> 21:33.379
we'll have actors
in old-timey clothes

21:33.422 --> 21:36.251
carrying axes
wake the guests up.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.340
So, once again, who was right?

21:38.384 --> 21:40.124
You, Margaret.

21:40.168 --> 21:42.126
You're damn fucking tooting.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.432
What else do you have?

21:43.476 --> 21:45.391
Uh, have we heard back
about the Ed Gein farm?

21:45.434 --> 21:47.175
Oh, I have my lamp guy

21:47.218 --> 21:49.612
making faux human skin shades
for every room.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.485
Um, that deal fell through.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.051
-What?
-Um,

21:54.095 --> 21:55.357
some of the locals
were making noise

21:55.401 --> 21:57.620
-about us being down there.
-Oh.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.580
Okay, so they would rather
their town remain a boil

22:00.623 --> 22:03.278
on the sphincter
that is Wisconsin?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.149
-Oh.
-They don't want
tourists and yuppies

22:05.193 --> 22:07.630
making the trip up there
to buy their homemade jams

22:07.674 --> 22:10.416
and disgusting beef jerky
and bathtub gasoline

22:10.459 --> 22:13.593
because myimmersive
Ed Gein experience

22:13.636 --> 22:15.203
gave them a reason
to make the trip?

22:15.246 --> 22:17.292
They think it's morbid.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.989
That we dishonor the dead.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.949
Frankly, it's the third deal

22:21.992 --> 22:24.386
that has fallen through
in the last few months.

22:24.430 --> 22:28.259
Maybe we should think
about selling the business.

22:28.303 --> 22:30.523
We're at peak value.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.525
Bullshit!

22:32.568 --> 22:34.004
We are just beginning.

22:34.048 --> 22:37.312
Murder has alwayssold well.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.794
You're gonna want to see this.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.754
"Murder returns
to Camp Redwood."

22:44.798 --> 22:47.322
COURTNEY:
Do we still own that camp?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.193
That means we're liable.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.239
The families could sue.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.546
Oh, this is just a disaster.

22:53.589 --> 22:55.548
MARGARET:
This is not a disaster.

22:55.591 --> 22:58.159
This is the best news
we've gotten in years.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.470
MAN:
Mmm, mmm, mmm? Come on.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.342
Yum, yum, green stuff.
It's delicious.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.475
He's just like his father.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.433
He hates his vegetables.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.653
Oh, he's nothing like me.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.350
He'll never be a loser.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.483
He'll never have to...
change his name,

23:17.526 --> 23:19.528
-hide who he really is.
-Baby.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.487
This is Alaska.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.880
Everybody here is running
from something.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.448
How many times do I have

23:26.492 --> 23:28.102
to tell you? You're my Superman.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.147
You saved my life.

23:30.191 --> 23:33.586
Sometimes I don't feel
like I deserve him or you.

23:33.629 --> 23:36.066
Not after everything I've done.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.852
You were a murderer,
and I was a prostitute.

23:38.895 --> 23:43.030
And people like us
need to forget the past.

23:43.073 --> 23:45.336
All we have is now,
and all we can do

23:45.380 --> 23:48.296
is answer one question
every day.

23:48.339 --> 23:50.341
Are you happy?

23:52.387 --> 23:54.345
I am.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.652
I am, too.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.612
Okay, you got to go.

23:59.655 --> 24:02.092
Come on. I'll try feeding him.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.355
Oh, I don't want to jinx it,

24:04.399 --> 24:07.968
but Brett told me
I'm up for a promotion.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.362
-Assistant manager.
-Oh.

24:11.406 --> 24:14.627
Well, then, you definitelydon't want to be late for work.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.893
All right.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.329
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

24:21.372 --> 24:22.722
-: Bye-bye. Bye-bye.-Bye-bye.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.985
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye, Daddy.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.291
All right. Hey. Come on, sugar.

24:27.335 --> 24:28.423
-Eat something for Mama.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.121
Grow up big and strong

24:31.165 --> 24:32.906
-like your daddy.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.179
I hate it
when people return the movie

24:45.222 --> 24:46.572
at the end of the tape.

24:46.615 --> 24:49.575
Be kind, rewind.

24:49.618 --> 24:51.185
That's cool.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.187
We should put that on a sign.

24:56.843 --> 24:59.149
You know, most of my staff,

24:59.193 --> 25:01.325
they don't give a shit
about renting videos.

25:01.369 --> 25:04.111
But you're killing it, Donald.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.417
I like it here.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.202
I heard the owner's thinking
about opening another store

25:08.245 --> 25:09.769
in Juneau.

25:09.812 --> 25:12.206
Lots of opportunities in VHS.

25:20.388 --> 25:21.737
MARGARET:
Now, I know

25:21.781 --> 25:24.914
both the beauty
and the horror of this camp.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.264
I want to baptize this place.

25:27.308 --> 25:30.224
Yes, with the cool waters
of this bottomless lake,

25:30.267 --> 25:32.705
which is perfect
for swimming and boating,

25:32.748 --> 25:36.230
but also with the power
of rock and roll!

25:36.273 --> 25:40.147
I've secured
an all-star lineup of bands,

25:40.190 --> 25:42.497
and a select, well-paying few

25:42.541 --> 25:46.675
can stay in the actual cabinswhere the massacres took place.

25:46.719 --> 25:49.809
Any of your famous scares
planned for Halloween night?

25:49.852 --> 25:51.201
You know me well.

25:51.245 --> 25:55.728
Yes, there will be plentyof spooky and bloody surprises.

25:55.771 --> 25:57.817
But call our 800 number
as soon as you can,

25:57.860 --> 25:59.166
because our VIP members

25:59.209 --> 26:01.647
have already bought
80% of our tickets

26:01.690 --> 26:03.779
during our special presale.

26:03.823 --> 26:05.215
Aren't you concerned
with the recent murders

26:05.259 --> 26:07.217
that occurred in this very spot?

26:07.261 --> 26:08.828
There's still blood on the dock.

26:08.871 --> 26:11.787
Well, yes, there may be a killer

26:11.831 --> 26:13.310
stalking these woods again.

26:13.354 --> 26:16.792
But don't you want to be scared?

26:16.836 --> 26:18.402
-All right, that's it for today.-

26:20.883 --> 26:22.232
-Margaret.
-Wait.

26:22.276 --> 26:25.322
Wait. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.281
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

26:27.324 --> 26:30.545
to have every cell in your bodyscreaming for oxygen,

26:30.589 --> 26:32.678
and all you can breathe
is water?

26:34.897 --> 26:37.030
That bitch needs to die.

26:37.073 --> 26:39.554
Don't worry.
You'll have your chance.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.034
We all will.

26:41.077 --> 26:44.124
It's gonna be
full hunting grounds.

26:44.167 --> 26:47.040
REPORTER:
And in the latest twist
of a role reversal,

26:47.083 --> 26:48.824
the site
for the hottest music fest

26:48.868 --> 26:51.871
on Halloween weekend
is Camp Redwood,

26:51.914 --> 26:56.005
the blood-soaked grounds
of the infamous 1984 murders.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.704
The festival is the brainchild of Margaret Booth,

26:58.747 --> 27:00.488
the survivor of the massacre

27:00.531 --> 27:02.838
turned mega successful
real estate magnate.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.927
I'm sorry, Donald.
I'll turn it off.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.886
It's okay.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.452
But you-you told me

27:08.496 --> 27:10.498
you never want to see
that place again.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.982
Camp Redwood was another life.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.942
I look at that place now,

27:19.986 --> 27:21.944
and I feel...

27:21.988 --> 27:23.642
nothing.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.646
I'm over it.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.913
I'm free.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.853
Oh, shoot. Sorry.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.952
Looking nice, Red.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.823
Thanks, baby. You, too.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.825
Some scene out there.

28:16.869 --> 28:19.436
I almost thought I wasn't gonnaget in to see you.

28:19.480 --> 28:23.179
People are jerking offover some chick eating a needle.

28:23.223 --> 28:27.096
Like anyone gives a shit
about what they think.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.968
You think it's finally gonna
happen tonight?

28:29.011 --> 28:31.753
She lost her final appeal.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.016
Bitch is gonna buy it.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.452
It's too bad.

28:35.496 --> 28:38.064
She's got some skills.

28:40.240 --> 28:44.374
Well, I think I have some news
that you might like.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.336
There's a concert coming up.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.903
It sounds really cool.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.165
They're having it
out where they had

28:52.208 --> 28:53.906
all those murders in '84.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.821
Camp Redwood.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.387
Check out the headliner.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.478
Billy Idol.

29:01.522 --> 29:05.047
I know you're a huge fan,
so I bought a ticket,

29:05.091 --> 29:06.788
and I'm gonna bring
a tape recorder in there

29:06.832 --> 29:09.269
and make you
your very own bootleg.

29:10.313 --> 29:12.272
These other bands--

29:12.315 --> 29:14.927
bunch of one-hit,
new wave clowns.

29:14.970 --> 29:18.060
20 years from now, no one's
gonna know they ever existed.

29:19.105 --> 29:20.933
Who cares about them?

29:20.976 --> 29:22.848
That's the point.

29:22.891 --> 29:25.938
The '80s was their time.

29:25.981 --> 29:26.939
And mine.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.941
But the decade's ending.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.073
Pretty soon,
I'm gonna be just like them.

29:31.117 --> 29:33.815
The fucking pop culture trivia.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.817
A novelty act,
faded into memory.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.515
-That's not true.
-It will be

29:38.559 --> 29:40.909
if I don't do anything about it.

29:42.432 --> 29:46.001
A true artist has many phases.

29:46.045 --> 29:49.091
They produce over many decades,not just one.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.266
They evolve.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.181
Like Picasso

29:52.225 --> 29:53.182
or Billy or...

29:53.226 --> 29:56.577
I don't want to fade, Red.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.841
I want to be immortal.

30:01.364 --> 30:04.541
I need to make sure
they never forget.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.114
All prisoners secured

30:12.158 --> 30:13.420
-and accounted for?

30:13.463 --> 30:15.074
Yes, sir.

30:15.117 --> 30:16.075
I see no one's warned you

30:16.118 --> 30:18.773
about the dangers
of eating prison chow.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.367
It's time.

30:59.379 --> 31:03.731
It's customary that I offer
last rites to the condemned.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.994
God wants to save every soul,

31:06.038 --> 31:07.256
even yours.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.605
Fuck that guy.

31:08.649 --> 31:09.911
RAMIREZ:
Amen to that.

31:09.955 --> 31:13.132
Last chance, baby girl.

31:15.134 --> 31:17.136
Ride or die?

31:36.242 --> 31:38.070
Master,

31:38.113 --> 31:41.073
I don't question your judgment

31:41.116 --> 31:43.858
or why you've put me here.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.644
But I can be more.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.953
Give me a shot at immortality,

31:51.997 --> 31:55.565
and I promisethe rivers of hell will overflow

31:55.609 --> 32:00.135
with the rain of souls
that I send you.

32:13.496 --> 32:16.499
WARDEN:
If you have any last words...

32:26.074 --> 32:29.556
I know you're there, Margaret.

32:29.599 --> 32:33.212
I have committed no crimes.

32:33.255 --> 32:37.694
I am and always will be
innocent.

32:37.738 --> 32:40.088
And you...

32:40.132 --> 32:44.049
are gonna burn
for wanting to watch me die.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.289
GUARD:
Had to have a third one,
didn't you?

33:50.332 --> 33:52.117
Idiot.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.010
I knew you'd come.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.941
WARDEN:
Time of death, 12:02 a.m.

35:17.985 --> 35:20.814
The sentence of Brooke Thompsonhas been carried out.

35:20.857 --> 35:23.077
Please exit.

35:31.433 --> 35:34.393
Well, that was... anticlimactic.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.395
It was a fucking bore
is what it was.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.266
They really should bring back
the guillotine.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.573
I would have paid good money
to see her head roll.

35:59.113 --> 36:00.419
Dude, I came here last night
and rented three movies.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.768
Friday the 13th,

36:01.811 --> 36:04.553
Faces of Death,
and Nightmare on Elm Street.

36:04.597 --> 36:08.253
But th-this is what you gave me.

36:09.341 --> 36:11.778
Um...

36:11.821 --> 36:14.215
Terms of Endearment,

36:14.259 --> 36:16.565
Mystic Pizza,and...

36:16.609 --> 36:20.047
Tootsie.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.571
Is this some kind of joke
or are you just plain stupid?

36:22.615 --> 36:25.487
There's not one kill
in those three movies.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.097
You shouldn't watch
horror movies.

36:27.141 --> 36:30.275
There's too much violence
in this society.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.894
Sorry I'm late.

36:40.937 --> 36:43.244
Brett had me stocking
a hundred copies

36:43.288 --> 36:45.899
of Who Framed Roger Rabbit
for Friday.

36:45.942 --> 36:48.858
But guess who got
an advance copy.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.429

37:01.219 --> 37:02.263
