02:10.979 --> 02:12.439
Shit.

02:26.954 --> 02:31.291
Oh! Sorry, Miss Rosa. It's colder
than an Eskimo's nuts in here!

02:31.959 --> 02:34.878
I'm trying to get the heat going,
but when I turn it up too high,

02:34.962 --> 02:37.297
a real bad smell comes out of the blowers.

02:37.422 --> 02:40.675
I think it's mouse shit. You
know, they live in the engine.

02:40.843 --> 02:41.844
Just don't breathe in.

02:42.677 --> 02:45.263
I'm going to get poison
pumped into my veins.

02:47.307 --> 02:49.476
What's a little mouse shit in my lungs?

02:49.559 --> 02:50.602
Ha!

02:51.394 --> 02:52.896
All set? Seat belts on.

03:08.703 --> 03:09.997
How's wedding planning going?

03:11.123 --> 03:14.626
We're holdin' off for a minute.
Just pressin' the pause button.

03:15.878 --> 03:19.339
Too many people wanna come,
you know? I got a big family.

03:19.547 --> 03:24.511
Big, number-wise, not big fat.
Although, there are some fatties.

03:25.512 --> 03:28.348
And it's hard for me to book
all the vendors from in here.

03:28.431 --> 03:31.143
You know, none of 'em are
on my approved call list.

03:31.226 --> 03:35.022
Weddings were bad luck for
me. All my husbands died.

03:35.147 --> 03:36.273
How many were there?

03:36.356 --> 03:38.775
Two. The third one I wouldn't marry.

03:39.401 --> 03:43.864
Once you know you got a curse
on you, you can work around it.

03:43.947 --> 03:45.365
He lives in Canarsie.

03:45.448 --> 03:48.952
I didn't know that. You
never talk about your life.

03:49.077 --> 03:51.538
Nobody cares.

03:53.248 --> 03:54.791
How much time you got left?

03:55.417 --> 03:56.584
More than two years.

03:58.295 --> 04:02.465
You're still young, pretty. You
got your whole life ahead of you.

04:03.258 --> 04:04.467
Me?

04:06.553 --> 04:08.638
I'm gonna die here.

04:15.478 --> 04:17.022
Where the heck have you been?

04:17.397 --> 04:18.523
At the movies.

04:18.606 --> 04:22.777
Perfect. In the middle of
the day. What'd you see?

04:22.945 --> 04:25.363
- Twilight.
- For what, the 14th time?

04:25.447 --> 04:27.199
Don't you live the fuckin' life of leisure?

04:27.282 --> 04:30.660
Hey, Noise Pollution One and Two,
I'm trying to watch my program here.

04:30.743 --> 04:32.245
And send those kids outside.

04:32.329 --> 04:33.746
Mikey, turn it up.

04:33.830 --> 04:35.457
Ma's been ringing her bell for an hour.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.749
What am I, Cinderella?

04:36.917 --> 04:40.795
It is your turn! I cleaned her sheets
this morning. Piss and everything.

04:41.796 --> 04:44.424
Oh!

04:44.507 --> 04:48.428
Watch your baby, would you? It's
a miracle he's lived this long.

04:49.596 --> 04:50.638
Ugh!

04:50.722 --> 04:51.848
Hey!

04:53.976 --> 04:57.229
Lorna! Lorna!

04:57.895 --> 04:58.896
That you?

05:35.517 --> 05:36.893
All right.

05:42.649 --> 05:47.487
Hello. Yes. I purchased
a pair of shoes from you.

05:47.779 --> 05:54.702
Order 1-1-0-0-6-1-7-8, a pair of
patchwork platform Pradas. Uh-huh.

05:56.204 --> 06:00.375
Yeah, I can see that my card has been
charged, but I never received them.

06:01.584 --> 06:06.881
No, I haven't moved. Yeah!
That's the address I gave you.

06:09.384 --> 06:12.637
No... I'm not accusing you
of not having sent them,

06:12.720 --> 06:15.432
but the fact is they never came.

06:18.893 --> 06:22.855
Yes, yes, it is unfortunate,
'cause I had this big party to go to

06:23.022 --> 06:25.775
and I had to wear last season's Miu Miu's.

06:25.942 --> 06:27.152
Hmm.

06:27.235 --> 06:30.072
No. No, I don't want another pair.

06:30.447 --> 06:34.826
I want a refund. Yeah,
that's right. A full refund.

06:37.370 --> 06:41.291
Aw, thank you for your
honesty, I really appreciate it.

06:41.749 --> 06:45.212
Yes. Yes, I do have my card number.

06:45.878 --> 06:47.755
Check this bitch out.

06:49.841 --> 06:52.344
I'm surprised she doesn't get
a shot for putting on that face.

06:53.761 --> 06:56.181
If the cop's in a bad mood, she does.

06:56.848 --> 07:00.059
I'm seeing a lot of blue
eye-shadow and red lipstick.

07:00.143 --> 07:03.480
It's not coming out of commissary.
Who's importing around here?

07:03.563 --> 07:06.274
Oh, not really a lot of
contraband these days.

07:06.358 --> 07:09.319
Hey! Not since Red got shut down.

07:09.402 --> 07:10.737
Red, huh?

07:11.321 --> 07:12.655
Well, that figures.

07:13.406 --> 07:15.242
Still, there's gotta be
some holes in this cheese.

07:15.325 --> 07:17.702
Somebody is bringing in something.

07:18.578 --> 07:23.375
Well, Poussey makes hooch. Oh!
And Chang, she got that Tiger Balm,

07:23.458 --> 07:28.588
but don't put it on your lips,
or your eyeballs. Bad idea.

07:29.381 --> 07:31.174
Hooch, huh?

07:32.092 --> 07:35.262
Shit tastes nasty. It's
like vomit wine coolers.

07:35.345 --> 07:40.892
Yo... It's got Kool-Aid, old
fruit, ketchup, and moldy bread.

07:41.184 --> 07:42.394
She sells that?

07:42.852 --> 07:47.399
I can't drink it. Makes me feel
funny, makes my head all fuzzy.

07:47.482 --> 07:49.859
You still carting that shit around?

07:49.942 --> 07:51.778
You one determined mo-fo.

07:51.861 --> 07:52.945
What the fuck is that?

07:53.488 --> 07:55.448
- It's a pee funnel.
- A what?

07:55.532 --> 07:58.785
I'm tired of trying to pop a
squat over them nasty-ass toilets.

07:58.868 --> 08:00.328
This rig is gonna make it easy.

08:00.412 --> 08:03.415
Girl, that's crazy. How you gonna use that?

08:03.498 --> 08:06.126
Yo, with this, I can pee
standing up. Like a dude.

08:06.376 --> 08:08.420
Take this part, put it over my stuff.

08:08.503 --> 08:10.755
Take this little tube
part, put it in the toilet.

08:10.963 --> 08:13.841
Or, you know what I'm saying,
right over it. It's genius, yo!

08:13.966 --> 08:16.386
I'm gonna call it the "stand and deliver."

08:17.053 --> 08:20.765
Hey! You should call the patent office
right now and make a million dollars.

08:20.848 --> 08:21.849
Really?

08:21.933 --> 08:24.269
Hell, no! That's the
stupidest idea I ever heard.

08:24.352 --> 08:27.355
No, it ain't, man. Them toilets
be cold as fuck in the morning.

08:27.439 --> 08:29.982
You'll see. Everybody gonna be
wanting one of these to piss in.

08:30.192 --> 08:31.318
Please. We're eating.

08:34.861 --> 08:36.905
Yeah, I just gotta find me some
waterproof tape or something

08:36.989 --> 08:37.990
to get these two parts together.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.409
I don't see why you need the funnel.

08:40.493 --> 08:43.913
Like, can't you just
put the tube up in you?

08:43.996 --> 08:47.041
Uh, no. 'Cause that's not
where the pee comes out.

08:47.124 --> 08:48.626
Uh, yeah, it do.

08:48.710 --> 08:50.044
- Out of the big hole.
- Yeah.

08:50.127 --> 08:51.713
No, y'all. There's a different hole.

08:51.796 --> 08:52.880
- For pee?
- Yeah.

08:52.964 --> 08:54.632
What? You crazy.

08:55.132 --> 08:57.760
Y'all, there is the main coochie hole

08:57.844 --> 08:59.887
and then there's, like, another
little hole just for pee.

09:01.306 --> 09:02.974
Didn't y'all take Sex Ed?

09:03.308 --> 09:08.855
She's right. There's an
eeny-meeny-weeny-weeny pee hole.

09:09.105 --> 09:14.151
Man, you trippin'. It all come
out the same hole. The vagina hole.

09:14.236 --> 09:18.490
All right, then how come you can still
pee when you got a tampon in? Mmm?

09:18.573 --> 09:21.826
I'm telling you, there's two holes.

09:22.535 --> 09:23.661
Three holes.

09:25.162 --> 09:26.163
The butt.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.836
All right. You are all disgusting. I'm out.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.838
I am not even gonna
entertain this conversation.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.090
Suzanne! You coming?

09:44.516 --> 09:46.058
Put my order in.

09:48.978 --> 09:53.525
I am so confused. Where is it at?

09:58.154 --> 10:00.865
Yo, I still don't see what
the hell you talkin' about!

10:00.948 --> 10:03.034
You know, your hole, like, your sex hole.

10:03.117 --> 10:06.162
The vagina hole. Yeah, I got that.

10:06.246 --> 10:07.455
Y'all are crazy.

10:07.539 --> 10:09.791
Man, I wish I had a
phone to record this shit.

10:09.874 --> 10:13.461
Now, look underneath your
clit, before the main hole.

10:13.586 --> 10:15.755
Or like, just inside the top of it.

10:15.838 --> 10:19.175
Man, I still can't see shit down here.

10:19.259 --> 10:22.679
It's like too many, like,
flappy-flap thingies.

10:23.095 --> 10:25.390
- Oh, God.
- How do you know all this?

10:25.473 --> 10:27.559
Yo, I've been up close and
personal with my share of pussy.

10:28.310 --> 10:29.561
Yeah, you want me to just show you?

10:29.644 --> 10:33.523
No! No, no, no. I can do
it. Just, just tell me where.

10:33.648 --> 10:39.612
Okay, right inside the big ol' hole
there's another hole. Like, a little one.

10:39.696 --> 10:43.866
Wait, what? I thought you
said it was a whole other hole.

10:44.075 --> 10:46.328
It's a hole in a hole.

10:46.411 --> 10:50.164
For the love of God, girls,
the hole is not inside the hole.

10:51.291 --> 10:53.918
You have your vagina proper,
then you have your clitoris.

10:54.126 --> 10:58.881
The urethra is located between the clit
and the vagina, inside the labia minora.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.718
- For real?
- For real.

11:01.801 --> 11:04.971
I designed one myself. Had
plans drawn up and everything.

11:05.137 --> 11:07.432
I seen some funky punani in my day.

11:07.515 --> 11:08.975
I'm not gonna leave that shit up to chance.

11:10.435 --> 11:14.188
Here. Take a long look, honey.
You'll see what I'm talking about.

11:22.321 --> 11:26.325
Oh, my God. Holy shit!

11:26.409 --> 11:27.994
Yo, y'all, she's right.

11:29.161 --> 11:31.539
Aw! It's cute.

11:31.623 --> 11:33.124
- Hey! I'm next!
- Yeah! Me, too.

11:33.207 --> 11:35.334
You know, I gotta see
this shit! Yo! Back up!

11:36.878 --> 11:40.757
Nichols! What the fuck? Why
you pickin' all the peaches?

11:40.923 --> 11:43.175
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

11:43.259 --> 11:47.096
Hascowitz? I've been trying to get
bumper-to-bumper with that for a month.

11:47.179 --> 11:49.849
And now, she feels used

11:49.974 --> 11:53.895
and doesn't wanna sleep around
because you got there first.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.397
Ah. Used, eh?

11:56.188 --> 12:01.277
She wasn't exactly new when I rode in
her, eh? A little dented actually, right?

12:01.360 --> 12:02.945
The upholstery was worn.

12:03.112 --> 12:04.447
You knew I was after that.

12:04.614 --> 12:06.908
Well, what can I say? Not
everyone wants a diesel dyke.

12:07.784 --> 12:08.785
Lay off my marks.

12:09.952 --> 12:13.581
Seriously. Enough with the
cliterference. What's this?

12:13.665 --> 12:16.626
Oh! Put that back, please.
Would you give it back?

12:16.709 --> 12:20.630
Who is Brook? Oh, yeah.
That's the new girl, isn't it?

12:20.880 --> 12:23.716
Hot one of the Asian persuasion?

12:24.759 --> 12:27.219
Oh, my God! I found your fuck book?

12:27.512 --> 12:28.721
Right. So what if it is?

12:28.805 --> 12:30.264
Oh, you fuckin' junkie.

12:30.347 --> 12:31.390
- All right.
- No, I get this.

12:31.474 --> 12:33.810
Better pussy than smack. Right?

12:34.351 --> 12:37.229
It's not an addiction. It's
a collection, all right?

12:37.564 --> 12:41.818
Some people collect buttons or Taco
Bell Chihuahuas, I collect orgasms.

12:42.151 --> 12:44.195
See, I'm all about giving.

12:44.278 --> 12:46.739
Look, I am like a
bean-flicking Mother Teresa.

12:47.449 --> 12:52.244
You know what? This here
is my kind of competition.

12:52.870 --> 12:57.166
It's on. Ooh! Bitch, this is on!

13:05.717 --> 13:07.426
So, what's the deal with Miss Rosa?

13:07.510 --> 13:09.596
I mean, I know they say she
has cancer and everything,

13:09.679 --> 13:13.182
but are they sure it's not alopecia?
And what's the deal with this room?

13:13.265 --> 13:16.519
Is everyone in here, like,
new or sick or just old?

13:16.603 --> 13:19.230
I mean, I can't believe how many
old people there are in here.

13:19.313 --> 13:23.359
Like, what did they do
that they're still in here?

13:23.442 --> 13:24.902
Like, what did she do?

13:24.986 --> 13:28.114
None of your fuckin'
business, you mental patient.

13:28.906 --> 13:32.368
But seriously, have they all been
in here since, like, the '70s?

13:32.451 --> 13:35.580
No, most of them got transferred
up from Max for good behavior.

13:36.163 --> 13:41.669
Wow. It is crazy to think about how
many years they spend in here, you know?

13:41.961 --> 13:45.381
I mean, I've been arrested
before, like loads of times.

13:45.464 --> 13:47.967
When they cleared out Zuccotti Park,
I spent three whole days in a cell.

13:48.050 --> 13:49.636
But that was jail and this is prison.

13:50.052 --> 13:51.554
They're pretty much the same thing.

13:51.638 --> 13:54.431
No, they're not. Your
parents pick you up from jail.

13:54.516 --> 13:58.561
Take out her batteries, would ya?
I'm trying to take a nap over here.

13:59.270 --> 14:03.274
Chapman, Soso, happy day in cell
block A, you are being assigned.

14:03.399 --> 14:04.441
Oh.

14:04.817 --> 14:06.360
Wait, did we do something wrong?

14:06.443 --> 14:08.237
No. We're getting our bunks.

14:08.320 --> 14:12.617
Oh, cool beans. Oh, my God, does
that mean we're gonna be roomies?

14:15.537 --> 14:18.247
Just so you know, I do
snore sometimes, so...

14:18.414 --> 14:20.583
But only if I'm on my
back or if I have a cold.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.835
So, just tell me to roll
over, and I totally will.

14:23.127 --> 14:24.837
- Morning, Officer Bell.
- O'Neill.

14:26.964 --> 14:30.259
Wow. I didn't expect the
bunks to feel so dorm-y.

14:30.510 --> 14:31.969
It kind of reminds me of camp, you know?

14:32.094 --> 14:35.848
Except without the gimp bracelets
and the archery and kind of sad.

14:35.973 --> 14:38.685
What a bunch of vultures.

14:42.313 --> 14:43.355
Wait, did you just steal that book?

14:43.439 --> 14:45.525
It's mine. I'm reclaiming it.

14:46.317 --> 14:48.903
Chapman, in here. Soso, follow me.

14:49.612 --> 14:50.738
We're not together?

14:50.822 --> 14:51.906
Thank you.

14:54.366 --> 14:55.535
Did you go to summer camp?

14:55.618 --> 14:57.870
It was seriously, like,
the best time of my life.

15:01.332 --> 15:02.458
Hi, Red.

15:03.042 --> 15:06.713
Oh, no, honey, you're not in here.

15:07.589 --> 15:09.006
Looks like I am.

15:16.723 --> 15:17.890
Can I move some of this stuff?

15:17.974 --> 15:20.602
No, you may not.

15:21.603 --> 15:23.104
Can I have a few of those hooks then?

15:23.187 --> 15:26.899
I need all four of them. They're mine.

15:57.054 --> 16:00.307
What are you gonna do? Not feed me?

16:14.864 --> 16:16.783
I have a mealy bug infestation.

16:16.991 --> 16:21.203
They secrete this powdery wax
substance. It's a bitch to get off.

16:21.453 --> 16:23.956
- You gave me a roommate.
- Yes, I did.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.834
I haven't had a bunkie in 12 years.

16:26.918 --> 16:28.502
We don't get special privileges

16:28.585 --> 16:33.049
when we turn our prison assignment
into a drug smuggling operation.

16:33.132 --> 16:35.592
You know that was never my game.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.262
Sure, pin it on a guy who's
not here to defend himself.

16:38.470 --> 16:40.097
He was counting on that.

16:40.514 --> 16:44.101
You got too big for your britches,
Red. We all turned the other way.

16:44.310 --> 16:47.396
You were bringing in
pantyhose and nail polish.

16:47.479 --> 16:49.440
Seemed harmless, kept the ladies happy.

16:49.606 --> 16:53.235
And Healy, he had his head
shoved so far up your ass

16:53.444 --> 16:54.737
he could chew your food for you.

16:55.071 --> 16:58.574
So frankly, I don't give a shit
whether it was you or somebody else.

16:58.825 --> 17:00.492
You let drugs in here.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.705
A girl died because of you.

17:06.040 --> 17:09.001
"A small leak can sink a great ship."

17:10.962 --> 17:12.714
- You know who said that?
- No.

17:12.797 --> 17:16.175
Neither do I. But I can't
have leaky holes in my prison.

17:17.175 --> 17:19.345
Nothing coming in, nothing going out.

17:20.637 --> 17:22.473
Welcome to retirement, Red.

17:22.556 --> 17:27.103
Get a hobby, crochet yourself a
fucking hammock for all I give a shit.

17:29.856 --> 17:33.650
Use a mixture of garlic,
vinegar and hot pepper sauce.

17:33.735 --> 17:35.862
It's a natural insecticide.

17:56.090 --> 17:57.967
Park in the garage and
I'll see you in three hours.

17:58.050 --> 17:59.426
I know the drill.

18:06.017 --> 18:07.059
I hate this part.

18:08.519 --> 18:09.520
Poor you.

18:42.303 --> 18:45.347
♪ Almost paradise ♪

18:46.348 --> 18:49.018
♪ We're knockin' on heaven's door ♪

18:50.102 --> 18:52.646
♪ It's almost paradise ♪

18:54.148 --> 18:57.860
♪ How could we ask for more? ♪

19:35.106 --> 19:38.650
Oh! Oh, my goodness, I am so sorry!

19:38.734 --> 19:40.736
No, that was me. Please, please.

19:40.820 --> 19:42.989
No! Oh, my God, I'm such a klutz.

19:43.072 --> 19:46.117
Not at all. Just looks like you
could use a couple more arms.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.161
Here you go.

19:50.204 --> 19:53.249
Wow. I heard the postal
service was going bankrupt.

19:53.457 --> 19:56.002
But it looks like you're
personally gonna turn that around.

19:57.169 --> 19:59.588
Well... I do... I do what I can.

19:59.671 --> 20:00.797
Yeah, a true patriot, huh?

20:00.965 --> 20:02.967
Oh, yeah! I love my country.

20:03.175 --> 20:04.886
Either that or you're running a mail scam.

20:04.969 --> 20:06.345
Yes. Oh!

20:06.553 --> 20:08.722
Here, let me help you with that.

20:09.681 --> 20:11.433
Thank you. Thank you...

20:11.976 --> 20:13.227
Uh, Christopher.

20:14.186 --> 20:17.064
- Christopher.
- Yeah.

20:17.398 --> 20:20.151
I'm sorry. You look like somebody.

20:23.070 --> 20:25.239
I'm Lorna Morello.

20:26.698 --> 20:29.785
Beautiful and Italian.
Today must be my lucky day.

20:33.705 --> 20:37.709
Well, Miss Morello, after you're done
cleaning this place out of postage,

20:37.793 --> 20:39.503
maybe I could take you for a coffee?

20:39.962 --> 20:42.131
I would love that, Christopher.

20:59.356 --> 21:00.774
Thank you.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.577
Well, if it isn't the wily
inventress of Litchfield

21:11.660 --> 21:13.579
about to make a fortune for herself.

21:13.662 --> 21:14.663
Ah, you know it.

21:14.746 --> 21:16.582
Yo, but I'm thinking of changing the name.

21:16.665 --> 21:18.042
What do you think about the "she-wee"?

21:18.125 --> 21:22.296
No, I'm talking about your other
little side business. Pruno.

21:22.796 --> 21:26.300
Oh, my hooch? That's just
for fun. There's no charge.

21:26.383 --> 21:27.759
The girls would pay for it.

21:27.843 --> 21:29.971
I mean, but that ain't the point.
I make it for me and my friends.

21:30.054 --> 21:32.098
Yeah, but you're missing an opportunity.

21:32.181 --> 21:35.267
Besides, I got me a killer recipe.

21:35.809 --> 21:38.479
We could compare notes,
tweak it a little bit.

21:38.562 --> 21:39.688
Charge by the cup.

21:39.771 --> 21:42.399
Hell, we could charge by the sip.

21:45.277 --> 21:49.781
Um, naw. That ain't my bag. Sorry.

22:13.097 --> 22:15.474
How are you feeling? You look better.

22:20.062 --> 22:21.938
You want to keep a burn from scarring?

22:22.564 --> 22:26.235
Mix some lemon juice with
Vaseline, apply it every day.

22:27.403 --> 22:28.737
What do you want?

22:28.820 --> 22:32.658
I want you to stop sulking. I
never meant for you to get hurt.

22:32.783 --> 22:34.326
I did it for the good of the family.

22:38.955 --> 22:41.833
It's not good enough, Red. No.

22:46.922 --> 22:48.257
Fine.

23:10.071 --> 23:11.113
May I sit here?

23:11.822 --> 23:12.864
Of course, dear.

23:13.074 --> 23:16.827
Tell that man at the end of
the table to stop winking at me.

23:21.665 --> 23:24.251
Don't watch her eat.
It'll drive you insane.

23:24.335 --> 23:26.170
She'll finish that soup next Monday.

23:26.253 --> 23:27.796
This is not looking right.

23:27.879 --> 23:29.381
Because you stitch too tight.

23:29.465 --> 23:33.635
Make a gauge swatch like I told
you and count your stitches,

23:33.719 --> 23:35.846
you won't have that problem.

23:35.929 --> 23:37.848
We have a crochet circle
if you'd like to join.

23:38.349 --> 23:42.978
I don't crochet. But that sounds very nice.

23:43.395 --> 23:45.981
Oh, it's boring as hell. But
what else have we got to do?

23:46.064 --> 23:47.608
What happened to my pants?

23:47.733 --> 23:48.942
The ones you're wearing?

23:50.611 --> 23:53.280
You just work on that soup there, Jimmy.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.117
Like a liquefied bowl of Jell-O.

23:56.908 --> 23:58.952
I can hear you, you old cunt.

24:09.213 --> 24:12.048
Fuck these bitches.

24:15.302 --> 24:16.637
No, I'm not done reading that!

24:16.803 --> 24:18.889
Everybody dies.

24:27.273 --> 24:28.857
- This is mine.
- No, it ain't.

24:28.940 --> 24:32.361
Then why does it have my inmate
number carved in the back?

24:32.444 --> 24:34.696
Eh! Fine, Inspector Gadget.

24:35.447 --> 24:38.033
Inspector Gadget was not a good detective.

24:38.325 --> 24:39.868
He just had a lot of stuff.

24:39.951 --> 24:42.204
Plus he had Penny and
the Brain helping him.

24:42.538 --> 24:44.456
You best get the fuck out now.

24:47.293 --> 24:49.461
This is unbelievable. You, too?

24:50.421 --> 24:52.839
None of us thought you were coming back.

24:57.553 --> 24:58.554
Really?

25:02.057 --> 25:04.851
It ain't about you. I like the beach.

25:06.603 --> 25:07.979
Keep it.

25:11.817 --> 25:12.984
That's my blanket.

25:13.402 --> 25:14.736
No, this is Miss Claudette's blanket.

25:14.820 --> 25:18.574
It's mine. We've talked about
this, and I'm taking it back.

25:18.657 --> 25:23.204
Really? And how do you suppose
you're going to do that?

25:26.164 --> 25:27.916
I don't wanna have to
get physical with you.

25:27.999 --> 25:33.505
Oh, please! I could snap your femur
like a toothpick, twiggy. Fuck off.

25:34.215 --> 25:36.425
Piper! There you are. Hi.

25:36.508 --> 25:38.219
Um, so, I heard tonight is movie night,

25:38.302 --> 25:39.886
and I don't have headphones
yet, so I went to...

25:39.970 --> 25:42.598
Hey! What's your name?

25:43.890 --> 25:47.311
Um, so, anyway, I guess
I just don't understand

25:47.394 --> 25:48.979
this Chinese lady at the commissary.

25:49.062 --> 25:52.023
Is she Chinese? I don't wanna
presume. She could be a Malay.

25:52.316 --> 25:53.317
Not now, Brook.

25:53.442 --> 25:54.693
Okay, should I meet you out here?

25:54.776 --> 25:58.655
I'm busy. Go back to your cube. Now.

25:58.739 --> 25:59.865
Okay, yeah!

26:01.825 --> 26:02.868
Bye!

26:05.161 --> 26:06.955
Looks like you got yourself a pet kitten.

26:07.038 --> 26:10.083
Oh, I just wanna put her in a bag of rocks
and dump her at the bottom of the lake.

26:12.419 --> 26:15.381
Hey... You really want that blanket?

26:16.257 --> 26:18.842
Maybe we could work out a trade?

26:24.348 --> 26:28.685
All this pee hole business... Like,
what the fuck else don't I know?

26:29.060 --> 26:33.440
I been living all these years and never
even looked at my own damn vajayjay.

26:33.524 --> 26:36.777
What other surprises my
body gonna spring on me?

26:36.860 --> 26:39.237
I mean, have you looked at these feet ever?

26:39.321 --> 26:40.989
Like, I don't wanna scare you,

26:41.072 --> 26:44.410
but I'm not sure if this
one right here's a toe.

26:44.493 --> 26:47.078
- Shut up.
- Nah! The little one, it don't look right.

26:47.162 --> 26:49.706
Could be a pencil eraser,
old piece of jerky...

26:49.790 --> 26:52.334
Oh, leave my feet alone!

26:52.418 --> 26:53.960
Yo, I'm done anyway.

26:55.086 --> 26:57.298
Check out my masterpiece.

26:59.591 --> 27:02.303
What? That's a hot-ass mess.

27:02.386 --> 27:03.554
It's abstract, yo!

27:03.637 --> 27:06.515
You only supposed to paint
the nail, not the skin! Fuck!

27:06.598 --> 27:10.018
Look, all innovators have
their work criticized at first.

27:10.101 --> 27:12.228
Appreciation will come. I'll give you time.

27:12.604 --> 27:13.939
I already have time.

27:14.022 --> 27:16.191
Time and a shit pedicure.

27:16.274 --> 27:18.402
No! Stop! You're gonna mess it up!

27:20.612 --> 27:22.155
- Stop!
- I'm bigger than you, bitch!

27:22.238 --> 27:26.868
I hate tickling! No! No!
Uncle! Uncle! I can't breathe!

27:42.759 --> 27:44.302
I'm sorry, P.

27:47.097 --> 27:48.807
We've been through this.

27:53.354 --> 27:54.521
I know.

27:58.609 --> 28:00.819
- I'm not...
- I know.

28:04.573 --> 28:09.495
Maybe we could cuddle for a minute?

28:12.498 --> 28:13.790
Yeah.

28:36.522 --> 28:39.525
Go back. You can still go back.

28:52.746 --> 28:53.872
That looks like fun.

28:56.417 --> 28:59.169
So, how long you been in treatment?

29:00.128 --> 29:02.130
Listen, I've gotta sit
here for the next two hours,

29:02.213 --> 29:05.050
and I don't really feel like
talking to some old bald lady.

29:05.133 --> 29:06.843
So can we just, like, pretend I'm not here?

29:11.473 --> 29:13.058
I was gonna tell you a joke.

29:13.475 --> 29:15.351
I'm good, thanks.

29:21.274 --> 29:24.570
Yo, Nurse! Do you have an iPhone charger?

29:24.986 --> 29:26.405
No, sorry.

29:27.363 --> 29:29.450
Oh, my God! This is bullshit.

29:33.954 --> 29:35.706
- What's your joke?
- Too late.

29:36.748 --> 29:38.834
Whatever. I'm sure it's stupid.

29:40.752 --> 29:45.090
So, the doctor says to the patient,

29:45.591 --> 29:48.760
"I got bad news and some more bad news.

29:49.177 --> 29:53.849
"The bad news is, you got
cancer." "And the more bad news?"

29:54.390 --> 29:56.685
"You also got Alzheimer's disease."

29:57.310 --> 29:59.771
So, the patient thinks for
a minute, and then she says,

30:00.146 --> 30:03.942
"Well, at least I don't have cancer!"

30:05.611 --> 30:06.612
I don't get it.

30:06.945 --> 30:10.657
I'm not gonna explain
it to you. Figure it out.

30:11.950 --> 30:13.869
I'm gonna grab a soda
from the vending machine.

30:13.952 --> 30:16.830
- Would you like anything?
- I'd love a Pepsi.

30:17.748 --> 30:19.332
Don't tell anyone.

30:22.669 --> 30:24.379
Who's that? Is she your daughter?

30:25.631 --> 30:27.633
She's a correctional officer.

30:28.759 --> 30:31.011
- Prison guard?
- Exactly.

30:31.094 --> 30:32.971
Wait. So you're not a...

30:34.973 --> 30:38.351
Are you? For serious?

30:38.977 --> 30:41.813
I thought those were just, like,
comfy old lady chemo clothes.

30:44.232 --> 30:45.233
What'd you do?

30:45.651 --> 30:47.360
Robbed a bank.

30:47.528 --> 30:48.862
You're lying. No way.

30:50.155 --> 30:51.322
Google me.

30:52.323 --> 30:53.825
All right. Come on, tell me about it.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.245
You want the first time or the last?

30:58.246 --> 31:00.832
The first time was in 1982...

31:15.764 --> 31:17.015
Fuck it.

33:15.801 --> 33:18.637
Hmm. Trash. Trash.

33:42.953 --> 33:45.205
Hmm? This too much for the Jersey shore?

33:45.288 --> 33:48.208
Not if you're gonna walk the boardwalk
looking to make some extra cash.

33:48.458 --> 33:50.251
Uh, it's Dolce & Gabbana, you nut.

33:50.335 --> 33:51.837
How the heck are you
paying for all this stuff?

33:51.920 --> 33:54.673
I get good deals. I'm a savvy shopper.

33:55.090 --> 33:57.050
And Christopher likes
me to look sophisticated.

33:57.133 --> 33:59.052
He says I'm like Audrey Hepburn.

33:59.135 --> 34:01.096
Besides, this is our first
weekend away together.

34:01.179 --> 34:04.057
- And we're staying somewhere fancy.
- Where?

34:04.140 --> 34:07.352
I don't know. He has
the whole time planned.

34:07.435 --> 34:09.896
He is gonna take me on a sailboat,

34:09.980 --> 34:13.775
and then we're gonna ride the
Wildwood Ferris Wheel at sunset.

34:14.234 --> 34:16.277
I can't believe I met
a guy like this, Franny.

34:17.362 --> 34:18.739
You should bring him over for dinner.

34:18.822 --> 34:21.116
What, to meet Ma and
everybody? Are you crazy?

34:21.199 --> 34:24.034
I don't want him getting
scared off, okay? He's the one.

34:24.119 --> 34:26.913
You don't know if he's the
one until he's met the family.

34:26.996 --> 34:28.123
It's like a test.

34:28.206 --> 34:32.377
He don't need a test,
okay? He's my destiny.

34:32.543 --> 34:35.045
And I'm telling you,
it was like the movies.

34:35.213 --> 34:39.009
Like, you know, in Notting Hill where
Hugh Grant bumps into Julia Roberts

34:39.092 --> 34:40.802
and he spills his orange juice on her?

34:41.302 --> 34:44.889
That's what happened to us. We
crashed into each other. Literally.

34:45.223 --> 34:49.310
I mean, Franny, it was meant to be.

34:53.231 --> 34:54.524
You look cute in that dress.

34:55.233 --> 34:56.359
Like Pretty Woman?

34:56.442 --> 34:58.444
Yeah, like Pretty Woman.

35:01.697 --> 35:06.077
Bastards! They grow as fast
as bamboo. It's an invasion.

35:09.330 --> 35:10.415
You know, I get them, too.

35:12.667 --> 35:15.586
Well, most of the time they're
blonde, and they are soft,

35:15.670 --> 35:17.130
but every once in a while,

35:17.213 --> 35:20.258
I do get one that is black and spiky,

35:20.341 --> 35:22.177
and if you don't catch it in time,

35:22.260 --> 35:23.845
all of a sudden it's like two feet long

35:23.929 --> 35:25.764
and it's growing right out
of the side of your face,

35:25.847 --> 35:28.724
like this giant, pubey, lady beard hair.

35:29.893 --> 35:32.645
You know, I get one right
here. Larry called him "Spike."

35:32.979 --> 35:34.105
How is he?

35:34.189 --> 35:38.860
Spike? Well, he's just
starting up, but I can feel him.

35:41.279 --> 35:43.239
The husband.

35:44.365 --> 35:48.494
I don't know. We don't talk. No letters.

35:49.329 --> 35:51.289
I used to get two a week.

35:53.583 --> 35:58.129
In fact, this week, all I got
was a card from my grandmother.

35:58.754 --> 36:01.299
My friends aren't feeling
too prolific these days.

36:01.466 --> 36:05.303
I'm sure he told them what a
horrible, evil cheater I am.

36:05.386 --> 36:08.431
And it's not like I'm in any
position to defend myself.

36:08.932 --> 36:10.725
Nobody has any idea what to say to me.

36:13.436 --> 36:15.063
People are fickle fucks.

36:15.146 --> 36:17.482
You know, the thing is, I don't blame them.

36:17.565 --> 36:21.277
I don't even blame him,
ultimately. I was selfish.

36:21.361 --> 36:24.530
You have to be selfish in
here. That's how you survive.

36:28.493 --> 36:30.495
People's loyalty means nothing.

36:31.579 --> 36:35.666
Because the second you're not
useful to them, you're out.

36:36.709 --> 36:38.837
You think that's why
your girls turned on you?

36:39.754 --> 36:40.964
Is that what you heard?

36:41.297 --> 36:46.761
No. I've just noticed that
you've been flying solo lately.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.848
My friendship used to come with perks.

36:50.181 --> 36:52.600
Now I'm just an angry old Russian lady.

36:52.851 --> 36:57.188
Without the free stockings and eyeliner,
I'm not quite the draw I used to be.

36:58.689 --> 37:02.360
And take it from me, Chapman,
husbands are overrated.

37:02.986 --> 37:06.572
They're as useless as
children. Count yourself lucky.

37:08.408 --> 37:11.202
If it was meant to last, it would have.

37:14.789 --> 37:17.167
Here. For Spike.

37:31.639 --> 37:34.976
He cried nonstop. By 4:00 a.m., I
was ready to smother him with a Boppy.

37:35.060 --> 37:36.394
I know, that's really dark,

37:36.477 --> 37:38.479
but I'm all alone until the
new baby nurse comes at 7:00!

37:38.563 --> 37:40.731
And then she leaves at 3:00! Fucking Pete.

37:40.982 --> 37:42.901
You know, what if I went off to Alaska?

37:42.984 --> 37:46.362
Just, "Peace out! I'm off to kayak
and pretend I'm fucking Bear Grylls,

37:46.571 --> 37:48.489
"'cause we spawned this
symbolic end of childhood

37:48.573 --> 37:50.575
"and I can't handle it
because I'm fucking Peter Pan."

37:50.783 --> 37:53.744
My therapist is an idiot,
misogynistic piece of shit.

37:53.912 --> 37:58.708
You should go. Seriously, just go,
you know, kayak with the Lost Boys.

37:59.334 --> 38:02.003
I'll keep this little monkey,
breast-feed him, raise him as my own,

38:02.253 --> 38:04.089
along with the baby
nurse from 7:00 to 3:00.

38:04.172 --> 38:08.176
She's not hot. She's got a
wonky eye and bad acne scars.

38:08.259 --> 38:09.594
And she's in her 50s.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.722
But she makes these amazing plantains
and sings him Jimmy Cliff songs.

38:12.805 --> 38:14.057
Sold.

38:16.142 --> 38:18.353
You're the only one who'll
still hang out with us.

38:18.436 --> 38:21.982
Everyone swears they'll still
come around, but they don't.

38:22.065 --> 38:23.233
How old is the baby?

38:23.316 --> 38:24.650
Uh, ten weeks.

38:24.734 --> 38:28.529
Congratulations. Oh, you're
such an attractive family.

38:30.781 --> 38:32.367
Thank you. Yeah, we...

38:32.450 --> 38:35.203
You know, despite the blond
hair, she still swears he's mine.

38:35.286 --> 38:36.287
What's his name?

38:36.912 --> 38:41.459
Hampus. Hampus Renselor.
It's an old family name.

38:41.542 --> 38:43.628
It's beautiful, isn't it? Little Hampy.

38:43.794 --> 38:45.171
How long have the two of you been married?

38:45.255 --> 38:47.548
Long time. We got married
on the Circle Line.

38:47.632 --> 38:50.593
In front of the Statue of Liberty.
It was beautiful. Huge wedding.

38:50.676 --> 38:53.221
- Did you meet in the city?
- Oh, we... Yeah, we sure did.

38:53.304 --> 38:56.807
At a Star Trek convention. Yeah,
we were both dressed as Klingons.

38:58.268 --> 38:59.269
It's a passion of ours.

38:59.352 --> 39:00.811
I knew right away she was the one.

39:00.979 --> 39:05.316
Well, enjoy. You're perfect
together, it's very clear.

39:09.737 --> 39:12.573
Hampus. It's not half bad, actually.

39:12.991 --> 39:15.035
There might still be time to
change the birth certificate.

39:16.327 --> 39:17.745
"Little Hampy."

39:20.623 --> 39:22.417
Blanca, careful with that box.

39:25.836 --> 39:27.880
How many do we have in there?

41:07.563 --> 41:08.731
Mmm...

41:14.862 --> 41:16.281
Please let the record show

41:16.364 --> 41:18.408
that the witness has
indicated the defendant.

41:18.491 --> 41:19.492
Proceed, counselor.

41:21.327 --> 41:26.999
Please tell the court how you happen
to know the defendant, Lorna Morello.

41:27.375 --> 41:29.043
We went on one date.

41:29.669 --> 41:32.463
I met her at the post
office and we had a coffee.

41:32.547 --> 41:35.425
And that was the extent
of your relationship?

41:35.508 --> 41:37.218
I wasn't interested in
pursuing things further.

41:38.136 --> 41:40.305
I told her that. Very clearly.

41:40.763 --> 41:44.600
And did Miss Morello continue to
contact you after this initial date?

41:45.601 --> 41:51.774
Relentlessly. Phone calls,
Facebook messages, texts, emails.

41:52.066 --> 41:53.276
She showed up at my house.

41:53.359 --> 41:56.070
Did you make it clear to her
that these advances were unwanted?

41:56.362 --> 41:59.615
I did. And then I began receiving threats.

41:59.699 --> 42:04.162
Now, Mr. MacLaren, did you take any
action to prevent these advances?

42:04.245 --> 42:08.833
I changed my phone number, my
email account, and I moved twice.

42:09.417 --> 42:10.710
Each time, she found me.

42:10.835 --> 42:12.837
When I started dating my
current girlfriend, Angela,

42:13.171 --> 42:15.548
she showed up in Atlantic City,
where we'd gone for the weekend.

42:15.965 --> 42:19.093
She left notes on my car,
she threw trash on my lawn,

42:19.177 --> 42:23.013
she left voicemails yelling about how
I wasn't helping enough with the dog.

42:23.348 --> 42:24.474
I don't even have a dog.

42:24.557 --> 42:26.601
And then she threatened to strangle Angela.

42:26.684 --> 42:28.228
And that's when I got a restraining order.

42:28.311 --> 42:30.521
Did she ever make an attempt on your life?

42:31.397 --> 42:36.277
Yes. We found a homemade explosive
device under Angela's car.

42:36.361 --> 42:41.366
Oh, he's being so dramatic.
They're twisting this whole story.

42:43.117 --> 42:44.118
Oh, sorry.

42:52.335 --> 42:55.796
Hey, Angela. Angela? Babe?

42:56.589 --> 42:59.008
Look at this. There's
glass all over the floor.

43:09.310 --> 43:10.645
Hello?

43:11.562 --> 43:13.063
Is anyone in here?

43:41.676 --> 43:43.093
You were right, Caputo.

43:43.844 --> 43:45.430
- About?
- I'm tired.

43:45.888 --> 43:50.560
I'm getting old. It's a new
phase of life. Time to pack it in.

43:51.561 --> 43:52.562
I'm glad to hear it.

43:52.645 --> 43:54.814
I'm officially one of
the Golden Girls, hmm?

43:54.897 --> 43:55.940
I sit with them at lunch.

43:56.691 --> 43:58.943
They've even asked me to
join their craft circle.

44:00.194 --> 44:01.571
What are you doing in my office?

44:01.654 --> 44:05.741
You told me to find a hobby,
and that's exactly what we need.

44:06.284 --> 44:10.621
Especially the old ladies. The
rest of the women here have work.

44:10.788 --> 44:13.916
There's no programs for those
who've been put out to pasture.

44:14.249 --> 44:17.837
What do you suggest? Aquarobics?

44:19.088 --> 44:23.133
- I hear gardening is very therapeutic.
- It is.

44:23.217 --> 44:25.511
It lowers stress, helps with depression.

44:26.220 --> 44:29.223
There's something about actually
putting your fingers in the dirt,

44:29.807 --> 44:32.017
nurturing something to life.

44:32.101 --> 44:33.978
I've read it can be very healing.

44:34.604 --> 44:39.274
People who do three hours of gardening
a week actually live longer. It's a fact.

44:39.859 --> 44:44.029
That old shed we use on grounds
crew, it used to be a greenhouse, no?

44:45.239 --> 44:47.658
Wouldn't be so hard to clean
it out, bring it to life.

44:48.283 --> 44:50.703
Let the old codgers tinker around.

44:51.286 --> 44:55.040
There's even a place to put your little
plants, besides your office window.

44:55.583 --> 44:59.587
From the look of them, they're
not getting the sun they need.

45:00.380 --> 45:01.464
What do you get out of it?

45:02.214 --> 45:06.343
I get to boss people around again.
Even if it is a bunch of fossils.

45:07.887 --> 45:10.347
Fig would never go for a new program.

45:10.431 --> 45:12.182
It wouldn't cost much.

45:15.770 --> 45:20.650
Bring me a budget. Seeds, soil,
everything spelled out on paper.

45:21.316 --> 45:22.527
I'll see what I can do.

45:33.037 --> 45:34.830
- I'm so sorry!
- For what?

45:34.914 --> 45:37.500
I just... I fell asleep. I
don't know what time it is.

45:37.583 --> 45:39.334
No worries. We just finished.
You're right on time.

45:57.895 --> 45:58.896
You okay, Morello?

45:59.313 --> 46:03.568
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine,
fine. How did it go, Rosa?

46:06.153 --> 46:07.362
Maybe you should just drive.

46:20.960 --> 46:25.881
I always thought it was one pooter hole
and a couple of different holes off of it,

46:25.965 --> 46:27.800
like a cave system or something.

46:28.300 --> 46:32.012
Now, see, sometimes my pee
comes out like a sprinkler.

46:32.096 --> 46:34.515
Like, it's not a steady
stream. It's more like...

46:34.599 --> 46:35.766
like a mini shower head.

46:36.308 --> 46:37.602
Are you listening to this?

46:37.852 --> 46:41.647
It's the talk of the town. The
wonders of the female anatomy.

46:41.731 --> 46:44.525
You know, someone needs to
get these women a medical book.

46:44.609 --> 46:46.110
This is ridiculous.

46:47.612 --> 46:48.738
Do you know?

46:48.821 --> 46:52.617
I mean... generally.

46:58.122 --> 47:00.290
Remember when that was you, Chapman?

47:00.457 --> 47:04.587
A lost little kumquat
looking for a place to sit.

47:05.379 --> 47:06.380
What's she in for?

47:06.463 --> 47:08.423
Some kind of political protest.

47:08.716 --> 47:11.051
You know, the two of you
might have a lot to talk about.

47:11.511 --> 47:12.803
I doubt that.

47:13.262 --> 47:17.975
These bogus bohemian babies have no
idea what a non-violent direct action is.

47:18.934 --> 47:20.269
Dirty, fake hippies.

47:20.394 --> 47:23.773
Wow. Someone's got some issues.

47:24.356 --> 47:27.985
Brook! Right here!

47:28.277 --> 47:30.905
Please don't do that. She's a gabber.

47:30.988 --> 47:32.114
Shall we adjourn?

47:32.197 --> 47:33.741
I think that's wise.

47:34.491 --> 47:38.245
Oh, my God, I am so relieved.
I thought you were mad at me.

47:38.328 --> 47:39.454
You're totally not mad at me, right?

47:39.539 --> 47:41.874
No, of course I'm not mad at you.

47:42.750 --> 47:48.172
Thank God. Everyone in here is
in such a bad mood all the time.

47:48.338 --> 47:50.507
I mean, like, I always
thought women's prison would be

47:50.591 --> 47:53.969
more about community
and girl power and stuff.

47:54.679 --> 47:56.931
But some of these women just seem crazy.

47:57.014 --> 47:58.683
It can be a lot worse than that, Brook.

47:58.766 --> 48:02.853
It can be seriously dangerous in here.

48:03.103 --> 48:04.104
Don't kid yourself.

48:05.147 --> 48:06.231
What do you mean?

48:07.316 --> 48:10.110
You're a pretty girl. And
you're gonna be a target.

48:10.360 --> 48:11.361
I know that I was.

48:11.486 --> 48:13.781
You mean like rape?

48:13.864 --> 48:17.076
Ooh, rape, assault, battery.

48:17.618 --> 48:21.496
You need to find yourself a prison wife.

48:22.164 --> 48:26.210
Somebody really tough. Somebody
nobody's gonna fuck with.

48:26.543 --> 48:27.587
Did you do that?

48:27.670 --> 48:30.673
All I'm saying is that one
night with the right protector

48:31.215 --> 48:34.301
can keep you safe for
the rest of your sentence.

48:35.427 --> 48:36.804
You mean you.

48:36.887 --> 48:38.555
No. See, I'm not tough.

48:39.056 --> 48:43.686
What you need is somebody
who inspires real fear.

48:43.894 --> 48:50.150
You know, somebody who's kind
of man-ish and kind of bulky,

48:50.234 --> 48:51.736
but tender at heart.

48:51.861 --> 48:54.905
And there's not a lot of good
ones. Most of them are taken.

48:55.572 --> 48:59.619
Hey, you two. What are
we talking about here?

49:00.870 --> 49:07.334
Well, you know, I am
feeling so single today.

49:09.544 --> 49:10.713
What's going on?

49:10.921 --> 49:14.508
Nothing. Big Boo, this is Brook.
And, Brook, this is Big Boo.

49:14.591 --> 49:15.676
Uh...

49:16.426 --> 49:20.555
Is this some kind of game? I don't get it.

49:21.515 --> 49:23.643
What is going on?

49:23.726 --> 49:25.853
Could you suck any more at this?

49:25.936 --> 49:28.105
I suck at this? I mean, look
at your ridiculous timing.

49:28.313 --> 49:31.651
Clearly this is not working, so
can I just have my blanket back?

49:31.734 --> 49:33.235
No! You didn't deliver.

49:33.318 --> 49:34.820
Deliver what? Me?

49:34.904 --> 49:35.946
I did my part.

49:38.032 --> 49:40.660
Were you trying to pimp me out?

49:40.785 --> 49:41.952
She took my blanket.

49:42.036 --> 49:44.454
It belonged to my roommate,
it meant a lot to me.

49:44.538 --> 49:48.793
Plus, it is very fucking
cold in the dormitories.

49:49.459 --> 49:53.463
You tried to sell me for a blanket?

49:54.173 --> 49:55.925
Well, when you put it that way...

49:56.591 --> 49:59.469
You are sick, you know that?

50:00.470 --> 50:02.932
You are seriously fucked up.

50:08.478 --> 50:13.400
You know, she's right, Chapman.
You're a horrible person.

50:27.790 --> 50:30.292
Hey, hey, what's the matter?

50:34.171 --> 50:35.505
You wanna talk about it?

50:41.846 --> 50:45.015
Oh, my God! Oh, wow!

50:46.767 --> 50:49.519
You know, I've only ever done
this with one other girl before.

50:49.979 --> 50:53.774
I think it was at Bonnaroo, and I made
out with the chick who painted my breasts.

50:54.942 --> 50:58.863
We were both wearing
these, like, big headdresses

50:58.946 --> 51:00.865
and, like, The String
Cheese Incident was playing,

51:00.948 --> 51:03.743
and we got up on stage and
we just started dancing.

51:03.951 --> 51:08.288
You know, when I think back on it, I think
I probably ended up getting heat stroke

51:08.372 --> 51:09.749
'cause the tent was like 1,000 degrees.

51:10.540 --> 51:12.376
Oh!

51:15.462 --> 51:17.172
That feels good.

51:17.547 --> 51:20.259
Do you ever feel like you're in your body,

51:20.675 --> 51:23.804
but you can really feel, like,
the space around you, like,

51:23.888 --> 51:29.476
air suddenly becomes, like, really heavy,
and you can feel, like, the atmosphere,

51:29.559 --> 51:32.396
and the molecules, just
hanging around your head.

51:32.938 --> 51:34.982
And then, you feel this tingling...

51:35.065 --> 51:37.317
There we go.

51:37.734 --> 51:38.819
Mmm.

51:39.403 --> 51:42.447
Fucking String Cheese.

51:57.963 --> 51:59.298
What?

52:20.277 --> 52:21.486
Where's your little cuddle bunny?

52:22.654 --> 52:23.655
What?

52:24.406 --> 52:26.075
I saw what went down in here.

52:26.158 --> 52:28.953
You all cozied up with
your little girlfriend.

52:29.161 --> 52:30.412
I ain't gay.

52:30.704 --> 52:32.372
Looked pretty gay to me.

52:33.248 --> 52:34.291
We just friends.

52:34.499 --> 52:36.126
Yeah? Just friends?

52:38.587 --> 52:42.842
And you're lonely. You
wanna be touched. Need a hug.

52:43.884 --> 52:45.469
Maybe even more than a hug.

52:46.011 --> 52:50.975
Need all that drama of
someone to call your own.

52:54.644 --> 52:56.146
Let me tell you something.

52:57.147 --> 52:59.942
Gay-for-the-stay is for punk ass bitches

53:00.025 --> 53:02.819
who aren't strong enough
to be true to themselves.

53:02.903 --> 53:05.239
I told you, I ain't like that.

53:05.322 --> 53:08.700
I know that. And I also know
that when you get out of here,

53:08.783 --> 53:11.620
you don't want people on the block
talking about how you went that way.

53:14.874 --> 53:20.129
That's why I'm telling you, do not
let her drag you into that shit.

53:20.212 --> 53:24.841
She is not your real friend.
She is only your friend in here.

53:28.637 --> 53:30.931
She doesn't know you like I do.

53:47.656 --> 53:49.283
I can't really tell if
he's breathing on here.

53:49.366 --> 53:50.409
Does he look dead to you?

53:52.286 --> 53:54.246
Yes. No.

53:55.664 --> 53:59.168
No, he's asleep. He is blissfully asleep.

53:59.251 --> 54:00.627
He's so cute, right?

54:01.378 --> 54:04.673
When he's sleeping, he's perfect.

54:06.800 --> 54:08.843
I loved playing house with you today.

54:11.596 --> 54:13.723
I don't know if I'm ever gonna have that.

54:13.807 --> 54:17.311
Yeah, you will. Shut the fuck up.

54:20.314 --> 54:21.481
I don't want to go home.

54:21.565 --> 54:26.736
Good. I don't want you to. You're
saving my life and my sanity.

54:27.487 --> 54:30.157
Plus, you change diapers.

54:30.240 --> 54:32.909
And I can pay you with
leftover Jamaican food.

54:36.246 --> 54:41.210
Honestly, Larry, I really wouldn't have
made it through this week without you.

54:43.587 --> 54:45.005
Thank you.

54:57.101 --> 55:00.104
Now, don't be so juvenile,
ladies. Listen up and learn, okay?

55:00.729 --> 55:04.233
Now, this is your vagina.
This is your labia minora,

55:04.316 --> 55:09.989
this, this is your clitoris,
and this is your urethra.

55:10.322 --> 55:11.698
This is where you pee from.

55:11.781 --> 55:13.450
Ah!

55:13.908 --> 55:18.205
Now, ladies, I want each and every one
of you to go back to your bunks tonight

55:18.455 --> 55:20.915
and get to know your own chachas, okay?

55:21.000 --> 55:24.461
No fucking way. I got a mons pubis.

55:24.711 --> 55:30.009
Yes, you do. And you also have a
labia majora and a clitoral hood.

55:30.259 --> 55:32.511
Now for those of you who are having
trouble finding your clitoris,

55:32.594 --> 55:35.514
or your partner is having
trouble finding your clitoris,

55:35.639 --> 55:39.393
you might have to pull back
the clitoral hood to expose it.

55:39.559 --> 55:40.935
Little known fact.

55:41.311 --> 55:45.982
The day I use this ticket is
the day New York has beaten me.

55:47.609 --> 55:50.862
You know, I just noticed
something. You're kind of a mess.

55:50.945 --> 55:52.864
Thank you.

55:52.947 --> 55:54.491
Nah, I mean, did anybody
ever tell you that?

55:54.574 --> 55:55.659
You're the first.

55:55.825 --> 55:57.536
Since when do they get all the best seats?

55:57.619 --> 55:59.371
The reign of whitey is over.

56:03.042 --> 56:04.293
I've never seen this movie before,

56:04.376 --> 56:07.087
but this is some serious
capitalist propaganda.

56:07.171 --> 56:08.755
I mean, why is that success?

56:08.922 --> 56:09.923
Are we all supposed to wanna work

56:10.006 --> 56:13.260
in a corner office and
make butt-loads of money?

56:13.343 --> 56:15.095
It's a total corporate agenda.

56:23.437 --> 56:25.105
Asshole.

56:28.692 --> 56:29.859
Yeah?

56:32.028 --> 56:33.029
Yeah.

56:34.198 --> 56:35.240
Hmm?

56:35.782 --> 56:38.452
Oh, my... You know...

56:40.787 --> 56:44.208
Yo, the Spanish bitches are sitting
on too many freakin' pillows,

56:44.333 --> 56:45.875
making it hard to see and shit.

56:48.170 --> 56:49.296
What'd you call me?

56:49.379 --> 56:51.506
Shit. In my day, the black
women would have done...

56:51.590 --> 56:55.051
Yeah, yeah, we know. Y'all ran this place.

57:00.307 --> 57:05.104
Shit, I missed, like, half
the movie. Where my seat at?

57:06.438 --> 57:07.647
Sorry.

57:08.648 --> 57:12.236
You didn't save me a seat?
You always save me a seat.

57:13.570 --> 57:15.071
You know how people are.

57:19.076 --> 57:20.077
What?

57:22.162 --> 57:24.206
Maybe you should get here on time.

57:32.297 --> 57:33.715
I've done a lot of stupid things.

57:33.798 --> 57:34.799
I bet you have.

57:34.883 --> 57:37.302
But I have never, ever been
involved with a married man.

57:37.386 --> 57:40.514
Well, he was sort of
separated when we started.

57:40.597 --> 57:42.516
Yeah, well, it turned out to be a lie.

57:42.599 --> 57:46.395
The whole thing was a mistake. But
we live and we learn and we move on...

57:51.065 --> 57:52.359
Are you okay?

57:53.860 --> 57:56.655
I'm fine. I'm just...

57:56.738 --> 57:59.533
I'm missing my fiancé, Christopher, is all.

58:00.992 --> 58:04.788
Oh, honey. Deep breaths.

58:05.539 --> 58:09.751
Time is all relative. You'll
be together before you know it.

58:10.084 --> 58:12.754
And married. We'll be married.

58:13.087 --> 58:14.506
Of course you will.

58:20.137 --> 58:24.808
I've decided not to wear a
veil. It's too traditional.

58:26.185 --> 58:28.728
And I want him to see my face.

58:31.022 --> 58:35.152
Why hide it? It's gorgeous.
