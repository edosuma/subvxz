00:40.356 --> 00:41.473
You hungry?

00:41.475 --> 00:43.441
Mrs. Van Horn,

00:43.443 --> 00:44.559
are you trying
to seduce me?

00:44.561 --> 00:46.311
Well, whatever gave you
that idea, honey?

00:54.437 --> 00:55.737
Dinner first.

00:55.739 --> 00:57.572
Then dessert.

00:57.574 --> 00:58.907
Come here.

00:58.909 --> 01:01.126
Uh-uh.

01:03.579 --> 01:05.580
Okay.

01:05.582 --> 01:07.799
Okay.

01:09.085 --> 01:10.869
Have it your way.

01:12.722 --> 01:15.423
You're the boss.

01:20.763 --> 01:22.647
You're in big trouble now.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.332
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

01:40.700 --> 01:43.401
You coming in?

01:50.276 --> 01:51.693
Kaylea!

03:18.047 --> 03:19.264
Morning.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.666
Good morning.

03:24.804 --> 03:26.972
You nervous about today?

03:29.275 --> 03:31.693
I just can't believe
after so many years,

03:31.695 --> 03:33.478
today's the last
day that I'm going

03:33.480 --> 03:35.680
to be putting on a uniform.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.185
Look, I'm not
gonna lie to you

03:41.187 --> 03:42.520
and tell you it's
an easy transition,

03:42.522 --> 03:43.738
because it's not, okay?

03:43.740 --> 03:45.073
But you're gonna be fine.

03:46.792 --> 03:49.027
I mean, you should be excited.
This is, uh...

03:49.029 --> 03:50.628
It's like a new chapter
in your life.

03:50.630 --> 03:54.249
It's-it's the beginning
of an adventure.

03:54.251 --> 03:57.168
Are you sure
it doesn't bother you?

03:57.170 --> 03:58.553
What?

03:58.555 --> 04:01.539
Billy being my new boss?

04:01.541 --> 04:03.641
Why, because he's your ex?

04:04.977 --> 04:07.345
No, it doesn't bother me.
I'm fine.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.813
You're lying.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.181
Totally lying.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.766
Well, of course I'm lying.

04:13.969 --> 04:15.737
Look, I trust you, okay?

04:15.739 --> 04:17.889
That's all I need.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.274
Okay?

04:19.276 --> 04:21.108
Good.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.448
Come here.

04:31.838 --> 04:34.005
Oh.

04:35.958 --> 04:37.675
I got to get that.
Yeah, I know.

04:41.931 --> 04:43.848
I'll call you later.
Okay.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.217
Bye.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.124
<i>So, around about 2:00 a.m.</i>

05:09.126 --> 05:11.793
neighborhood security noticed
the property's front gate open.

05:11.795 --> 05:14.662
They investigated,
found two vics, Kaylea

05:14.664 --> 05:16.614
and Dr. Phillip Van Horn.
They're old Hawaiian money.

05:16.616 --> 05:17.866
Big philanthropists here
on the island.

05:17.868 --> 05:20.001
This place looks fortified.

05:20.003 --> 05:21.519
Any idea how the perps got in?

05:21.521 --> 05:23.104
No, there's no signs
of forced entry,

05:23.106 --> 05:24.639
so whoever did this knew
how to bypass

05:24.641 --> 05:26.442
the security system.
What about those cameras?

05:26.443 --> 05:27.926
Disabled.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.761
All right, we got
fancy art on the walls.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.629
Look at this.

05:31.631 --> 05:34.015
Very expensive watch
still on the table.

05:34.017 --> 05:35.817
Clearly this wasn't
a simple robbery.

05:35.819 --> 05:37.852
All right, well,
the killer tossed the place

05:37.854 --> 05:38.870
looking for something.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.438
We need to work out
what that was.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.806
Oh. Do you hear that?

05:46.029 --> 05:48.029
Detective,
you can't go in there.

05:48.031 --> 05:48.573
What's going on?

05:48.598 --> 05:50.099
We're not supposed to touch her
till Family Services arrives.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.032
Come on, man.

05:51.034 --> 05:52.117
She's scared.
Come here.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.202
Come here.
Come here.

05:54.204 --> 05:55.787
It's okay. I know. It's okay.

05:55.789 --> 05:56.905
I know.

05:56.907 --> 05:58.706
You all right? Shh.

05:58.708 --> 06:00.458
Come here.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.493
She all right?
Yeah.

06:02.495 --> 06:03.545
Whatever they were
looking for

06:03.547 --> 06:05.329
cost this little girl
her family.

06:06.183 --> 06:08.433
Come here. Come on. Shh.

06:28.148 --> 06:29.415
Wow, Max.

06:29.417 --> 06:31.284
I didn't know you spoke German.
I'm impressed.

06:31.286 --> 06:34.971
In the words of Optimus Prime,
I am more than meets the eye.

06:35.706 --> 06:36.990
Was that who I
think it was?

06:36.992 --> 06:39.092
Oh, yes. And I'm happy to report

06:39.094 --> 06:40.927
that after very difficult
negotiations,

06:40.929 --> 06:43.012
I am very close to procuring
the requested item.

06:43.014 --> 06:44.097
Yes.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.548
What is that?
What are you talking about?

06:45.550 --> 06:47.550
Max is, uh... he's helping
me, uh... he's helping me

06:47.552 --> 06:50.219
get together a gift for Catherine
for her ceremony tonight.

06:50.221 --> 06:53.156
Oh, that's nice. You got
a personal shopper now.

06:53.158 --> 06:55.891
Why you got to be like...
What, are you jealous now?

06:55.893 --> 06:57.226
The request
was more akin

06:57.228 --> 07:00.780
to a favor solicited
by one BFF to another.

07:00.782 --> 07:01.869
Oh, you guys are BFF.
I didn't know.

07:01.870 --> 07:02.696
What do you mean, BFF.

07:02.701 --> 07:04.634
Boom. Like that.
BFF.

07:04.636 --> 07:06.219
I think that's adorable.
It's cute.

07:06.221 --> 07:07.670
Max,

07:07.672 --> 07:09.122
ignore him.
What do you got?

07:09.124 --> 07:12.692
Yes, well, based on
entry wounds and powder burns,

07:12.694 --> 07:14.761
I believe your suspects
shot the victims

07:14.763 --> 07:16.179
at close range
using suppressors.

07:16.181 --> 07:18.047
Suspects? As in more than one?

07:18.049 --> 07:19.015
That is correct.

07:19.017 --> 07:20.683
Striations
on the bullets suggest

07:20.685 --> 07:22.118
that three weapons were fired.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.770
I had ballistics run them
through IBIS,

07:23.772 --> 07:25.471
but unfortunately
no matches were found.

07:25.473 --> 07:27.423
Three shooters all
with suppressors.

07:27.425 --> 07:28.841
That's a professional hit.

07:30.779 --> 07:32.779
I'm sorry.

07:32.781 --> 07:35.898
I'm Alani.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.785
They said I'd find
my sister down here.

07:53.384 --> 07:55.117
I was just at my sister's house

07:55.119 --> 07:57.653
<i>the other day.</i>

07:57.655 --> 08:01.841
It was my niece's first time
in the pool.

08:03.260 --> 08:07.663
Everyone was so happy.

08:11.335 --> 08:13.069
Ma'am, we think the people
who did this

08:13.071 --> 08:15.304
were looking for something
inside that house.

08:15.306 --> 08:17.973
Do you have any idea
what that could have been?

08:17.975 --> 08:21.277
They have so many nice things.

08:21.279 --> 08:24.864
I couldn't even begin to guess.

08:24.866 --> 08:27.250
Um, you know, we were thinking
that it might've been something

08:27.252 --> 08:29.985
that was hidden. So did your
sister ever talk about, uh,

08:29.987 --> 08:31.087
something like that?

08:31.089 --> 08:33.322
No.

08:34.924 --> 08:36.842
Family Services said, uh,

08:36.845 --> 08:39.796
you're going to take custody
of your niece. How is she?

08:42.999 --> 08:44.967
Thank God she's-she's too young

08:44.969 --> 08:47.770
to understand what's going on.

08:49.289 --> 08:50.807
But one day she's gonna want

08:50.809 --> 08:53.543
to know who did this
to her parents.

08:57.431 --> 08:59.365
I want to be able

08:59.367 --> 09:01.484
to give her
an answer.

09:07.574 --> 09:09.809
Man.
What's up?

09:09.811 --> 09:12.161
Nothing. I just got
off the phone with Kono.

09:12.163 --> 09:13.129
She okay?

09:13.131 --> 09:15.197
She and Adam made it
to Hong Kong.

09:15.199 --> 09:17.166
So they're safe. For now.

09:17.168 --> 09:18.484
Listen, uh,

09:18.486 --> 09:19.802
HPD's rounding up all

09:19.804 --> 09:21.971
of Michael Noshimuri's
known Yakuza associates.

09:21.973 --> 09:23.506
Any of them are thinking
about getting cute,

09:23.508 --> 09:25.425
couple days in the hole,
they'll have second thoughts, right?

09:25.427 --> 09:27.143
I should be on a plane
to Hong Kong.

09:27.145 --> 09:30.379
Look, if that would get Kono
back, we'd all be on a plane.

09:30.381 --> 09:33.649
Best thing we can do right now
is get our head in the game.

09:33.651 --> 09:34.884
Yeah.

09:34.886 --> 09:36.853
All right, so, uh,
Van Horn's insurance company

09:36.855 --> 09:39.672
sent over photos of all
the valuables in their home.

09:39.674 --> 09:42.592
CSU's cross-checking it
against everything at the scene.

09:42.594 --> 09:45.077
All right, so if something was
stolen, we'll know soon enough.

09:45.079 --> 09:46.779
Yeah, but get this.

09:46.781 --> 09:48.097
Most of the valuables
were insured

09:48.099 --> 09:49.615
under the Van Horn Family Trust.

09:49.617 --> 09:50.950
Which means
that there's one person

09:50.952 --> 09:52.735
who's about to cash in
in a major way.

09:53.704 --> 09:55.121
Hewitt Van Horn.

09:55.123 --> 09:56.506
Phillip's only sibling.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.240
What do we know about him?
Well, for starters,

09:58.242 --> 09:59.959
he's been in and out
of trouble his whole life,

09:59.961 --> 10:01.627
drug charges,
multiple arrests.

10:01.629 --> 10:04.066
Okay, so he's the black
sheep of the family.

10:04.091 --> 10:04.965
Mm-hmm.

10:04.966 --> 10:06.349
And according
to the family lawyer,

10:06.351 --> 10:08.968
he blew through the last of
his trust fund six months ago,

10:08.970 --> 10:10.436
which means
he's now completely broke.

10:10.438 --> 10:12.388
Ah.
And get this.

10:12.390 --> 10:13.923
According
to the security company,

10:13.925 --> 10:16.676
anyone entering
the Van Horn home

10:16.678 --> 10:18.711
was assigned
a personal access code.

10:18.713 --> 10:21.564
It was a way of keeping track
of who was coming and going.

10:21.566 --> 10:23.783
Guess whose code was used
at the time of the murders.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.387
Room service!
Yeah, break out the bibs.

10:44.389 --> 10:46.722
It's lobster time.

10:46.724 --> 10:50.243
Whoa, where's the fire, brah?

10:52.880 --> 10:54.063
What's up?

10:55.149 --> 10:56.582
Ladies, let's go.

10:56.584 --> 10:58.100
Out, out,
out, out, out.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.270
Hewey,

11:01.272 --> 11:03.606
this is how you celebrate
your newfound wealth, huh?

11:03.608 --> 11:05.525
Hookers
and blow?

11:05.527 --> 11:06.726
Yeah, so?

11:06.728 --> 11:08.027
What's it to you guys?
What's it to us?

11:08.029 --> 11:09.045
Yeah.
Listen to me.

11:09.047 --> 11:11.113
Listen to me,
you lowlife.

11:11.115 --> 11:13.115
Explain something to me.
How long did you wait

11:13.117 --> 11:15.034
till after your brother
and his wife were dead

11:15.036 --> 11:16.335
to buy your first
eight ball?

11:16.337 --> 11:17.353
15 minutes?
20 minutes?

11:17.355 --> 11:19.488
Huh?
I gotta tell you, man,

11:19.490 --> 11:20.923
I've heard of stupid before,

11:20.925 --> 11:22.425
but orchestrating
a murder

11:22.427 --> 11:23.759
anthen supplying
the hired guns

11:23.761 --> 11:24.927
with your own personalized
security code...

11:24.929 --> 11:27.096
Come on.
Wh-What is that?

11:27.098 --> 11:28.881
You-you must be the
Einstein of stupidity.

11:28.883 --> 11:30.563
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up. Are you...

11:31.435 --> 11:33.970
Are you saying Phillip
and Kaylea are dead?

11:37.724 --> 11:38.941
Oh...

11:40.360 --> 11:42.862
Oh, God.

11:44.515 --> 11:46.699
Oh, it's all
my fault.

11:47.451 --> 11:49.285
What is all
your fault?

11:49.287 --> 11:51.287
Some guy approached me
at a club.

11:51.289 --> 11:53.372
Said he... said he wanted to
steal something from Phillip's.

11:53.374 --> 11:55.791
I-I didn't even ask what.

11:55.793 --> 11:58.160
He offered 15 grand
for my security code.

11:58.162 --> 12:00.997
15 grand!

12:00.999 --> 12:02.465
I needed
that money.

12:02.467 --> 12:04.667
But he promised
no one would get hurt.

12:04.669 --> 12:05.918
Oh, they did?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.536
Why don't you go tell
that to your niece?

12:09.006 --> 12:09.989
Is she okay?

12:09.991 --> 12:11.674
No, she's not okay, stupid.

12:11.676 --> 12:13.142
She's gonna grow up
without parents.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.846
Who'd you sell the code to?

12:17.898 --> 12:19.482
I don't know his name.

12:19.484 --> 12:21.267
Who'd you sell the code to?!

12:21.269 --> 12:22.485
I swear, I don't.

12:25.939 --> 12:27.189
But I know what
he looks like.

12:27.191 --> 12:28.107
Okay, good.

12:28.109 --> 12:29.391
Good. Then you
are gonna give

12:29.393 --> 12:30.743
a full description to
the police department.

12:30.745 --> 12:34.080
And then you are gonna spend
a very long time in jail.

12:43.507 --> 12:46.125
<i>So, the killers knew that</i>

12:46.127 --> 12:48.344
Hewitt was weak, right?
Figured he'd sell out quick.

12:48.346 --> 12:50.396
Plus, they threw in the
promise that nobody'd get hurt.

12:50.398 --> 12:51.631
Yeah, one dead brother,

12:51.633 --> 12:53.582
and the other one going
to prison for a very long time.

12:53.584 --> 12:55.017
Tell you what.
Tell you, the key

12:55.019 --> 12:56.218
to figuring this
out is working out

12:56.220 --> 12:57.520
what was stolen
from that house.

12:57.522 --> 12:58.688
If... if something
was stolen.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.255
We still don't know
if these guys got

13:00.257 --> 13:02.424
what they were looking for.

13:04.094 --> 13:07.029
What time is, uh,
Catherine's ceremony?

13:07.031 --> 13:09.649
6:30.
Aha.

13:09.651 --> 13:11.567
What, "Aha"?
What is that?

13:11.569 --> 13:13.936
What is that face?

13:13.938 --> 13:15.821
You know, uh,
when this is all over,

13:15.823 --> 13:17.623
you're only gonna have
yourself to blame.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.709
Oh, my...
You're gonna do this again?

13:19.711 --> 13:20.781
Again, really?

13:20.806 --> 13:22.045
Well, I'm gonna keep doing it
until I beat it

13:22.046 --> 13:25.464
into that dopey head of yours,
until you understand.

13:25.466 --> 13:27.466
You know what? I've known you
long enough, Danny, to know

13:27.468 --> 13:30.086
that the only way to get you to
shut up is to let you speak.

13:30.088 --> 13:32.788
So, you know what? Go ahead,
enlighten me, Dr. Phil.

13:32.790 --> 13:35.174
Oh... I'm op...
I'm ready. I'm ready to change.

13:35.176 --> 13:38.477
Law of nature says
that if you take a boy rabbit,

13:38.479 --> 13:42.264
and you take a girl rabbit, and
you put 'em into a cage together

13:42.266 --> 13:43.766
over a long period of time,

13:43.768 --> 13:45.351
what do you think is going
to happen?

13:45.353 --> 13:47.019
Are you real... are
you really doing it?

13:47.021 --> 13:49.155
Are you really gonna compare
Billy and Catherine to rabbits?

13:49.157 --> 13:50.305
We're all animals.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.692
We're not rabbits.

13:52.694 --> 13:54.777
But we are animals,
and this is my point.

13:54.779 --> 13:56.645
It is a fact,
after these long nights,

13:56.647 --> 13:59.365
long, hardworking nights,
bad Chinese food,

13:59.367 --> 14:00.816
law of nature says,

14:00.818 --> 14:02.868
these two people are going
to have a moment.

14:02.870 --> 14:04.503
A moment?
A moment. - A moment.

14:04.505 --> 14:07.089
A moment where they look
at each other in the eye,

14:07.091 --> 14:08.991
and bing, just like that,
everything comes back.

14:08.993 --> 14:10.159
All those old feelings.

14:10.161 --> 14:11.761
And you're gonna have
nobody else to blame

14:11.763 --> 14:14.163
but yourself, because
you let her take a job

14:14.165 --> 14:16.331
with her ex-boyfriend.

14:18.135 --> 14:20.636
This pause right now--
does this mean you're done,

14:20.638 --> 14:23.556
or are you just taking a breath
in between stupid assumptions?

14:23.558 --> 14:24.774
Stupid assumptions.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.692
You can live in denial
all you want,

14:26.694 --> 14:28.844
but this is a fact
of life, okay?

14:28.846 --> 14:30.062
When things are going good,

14:30.064 --> 14:31.680
nobody thinks
they're gonna go bad.

14:31.682 --> 14:34.683
And that's when you get hit with
it-- when you least expect it.

14:34.685 --> 14:37.186
Okay? That's all.
I'm not gonna say anything else.

14:38.739 --> 14:41.290
For now. Today.

14:44.077 --> 14:45.995
This photo was taken
six months ago

14:45.997 --> 14:47.580
in Phillip Van Horn's
home office.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.732
It's filled
with Hawaiian artifacts.

14:49.734 --> 14:51.984
After CSU finished
processing the scene,

14:51.986 --> 14:55.370
every item in this picture
was accounted for, except one.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.640
What is that?

14:57.642 --> 15:00.309
It looks like a piece of whale bone.
It's a scrimshaw.

15:00.311 --> 15:02.544
And according
to his insurance company,

15:02.546 --> 15:05.648
that particular piece
is almost 150 years old.

15:05.650 --> 15:07.767
And what makes it even
more interesting is,

15:07.769 --> 15:09.068
that is the
least valuable

15:09.070 --> 15:11.320
item on the list
that they sent over.

15:11.322 --> 15:14.256
Not according to the people
who executed the Van Horns.

15:14.258 --> 15:16.025
Besides, if it's out
in the open like that,

15:16.027 --> 15:17.109
why'd they tear up the house?

15:17.111 --> 15:18.744
Well, maybe the
Van Horns moved it,

15:18.746 --> 15:19.979
or maybe they hid it.

15:19.981 --> 15:22.615
This family seems to have a past
shrouded in mystery.

15:22.617 --> 15:23.899
See this?

15:23.901 --> 15:27.620
That's the crest
of the Royal League.

15:27.622 --> 15:30.956
It's an old Hawaiian secret
society that no longer exists.

15:30.958 --> 15:33.859
Now, our victim Phillip Van
Horn's great-great-grandfather,

15:33.861 --> 15:36.779
Jonas Van Horn,
was believed to be a member.

15:36.781 --> 15:37.763
What do we know about them?

15:37.765 --> 15:39.081
Other than the fact

15:39.083 --> 15:41.467
that it was disbanded
70 years ago, not much.

15:42.652 --> 15:44.053
There is somebody

15:44.055 --> 15:45.805
who could tell us more
about them,

15:45.807 --> 15:47.406
but, uh...

15:47.408 --> 15:49.258
But what?

15:51.361 --> 15:53.445
Chin, who is it?

15:53.447 --> 15:55.714
Okay, don't say
I didn't warn you.

15:55.716 --> 15:57.349
All right, a couple
of ground rules.

15:57.351 --> 15:58.984
Don't mention that
we're law enforcement.

15:58.986 --> 16:01.020
In fact, we should
hide our badges.

16:01.022 --> 16:02.988
What about my gun?

16:02.990 --> 16:05.875
Uh, that should be fine as
long as it stays holstered.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.459
Handshakes
are also fine.

16:07.461 --> 16:08.894
Just let him
initiate contact.

16:08.896 --> 16:10.913
And unless you guys have
written some dissertations

16:10.915 --> 16:14.917
I don't know about, do
not mention JFK, Area 51,

16:14.919 --> 16:17.119
and definitely,
no matter what,

16:17.121 --> 16:19.722
do not mention the
Apollo moon landing.

16:19.724 --> 16:22.174
Okay. Uh, can we feed him
after midnight?

16:28.515 --> 16:30.516
Chin Ho Kelly.

16:30.518 --> 16:33.602
Look at you, all grown up.

16:33.604 --> 16:36.689
Get your bony behind
in here and give me a big hug.

16:36.691 --> 16:37.823
Mmm!

16:37.825 --> 16:39.141
Nice to see
you, Auntie.

16:39.143 --> 16:40.809
Oh, nice to see you.

16:40.811 --> 16:43.629
Uh, my friends and I
are here to see Jerry.

16:43.631 --> 16:45.998
Uh, we need his help.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.450
You need <i>Jerry's</i> help?

16:49.502 --> 16:51.887
You sure?

16:53.174 --> 16:55.925
JFK, Apollo 12,

16:55.927 --> 16:58.994
Area 51.

16:58.996 --> 17:01.797
The Denver International
Airport.

17:01.799 --> 17:03.382
Our government wants us
to believe

17:03.384 --> 17:04.967
there's nothing going on.

17:04.969 --> 17:07.736
Like police turning you away
from a crime scene.

17:07.738 --> 17:10.539
"Move along, Mr. John Q Public.
There's nothing to see here."

17:10.540 --> 17:13.358
But there is much to witness.

17:13.361 --> 17:15.194
And I've ducked
under the yellow tape.

17:15.195 --> 17:17.363
I've read
beneath the redacted lines.

17:17.365 --> 17:19.397
The proof is out there.

17:21.819 --> 17:24.987
Hey, who's out there?

17:25.955 --> 17:27.723
Jerry, it's, uh, Chin Ho Kelly.

17:27.724 --> 17:29.308
Chin Ho!

17:29.310 --> 17:31.710
Hey, buddy.

17:31.712 --> 17:33.329
Hey.

17:33.331 --> 17:35.464
How are you?

17:35.466 --> 17:38.083
See you ran
into Moneypenny.

17:38.085 --> 17:40.669
The living-with-your-mom
cover has its pros and cons.

17:40.671 --> 17:43.472
Pro? She makes a hell
of a peach cobbler.

17:43.474 --> 17:45.424
Jerry, these are my friends
Steve and Danny.

17:45.426 --> 17:46.508
Hey, man.

17:46.510 --> 17:48.710
So, uh, how do you guys
know each other?

17:48.712 --> 17:49.695
High school.

17:49.697 --> 17:51.063
Oh, let me guess.

17:51.065 --> 17:52.381
Uh, starting quarterback,

17:52.383 --> 17:53.399
starting center.

17:53.401 --> 17:54.883
More like starting

17:54.885 --> 17:57.186
trumpet player,
starting French horn.

17:57.188 --> 17:58.821
Manoa Valley
Band Camp, 1985.

17:58.823 --> 18:00.406
Diddly-doo!

18:01.741 --> 18:02.858
Band camp?

18:02.860 --> 18:03.859
Yeah.

18:03.861 --> 18:05.210
Remember how tiny
those tents were?

18:05.212 --> 18:06.662
Dude, how could I forget.

18:06.664 --> 18:08.547
It's like we were stuck on
a deserted island all summer.

18:08.549 --> 18:10.649
Good times.

18:10.651 --> 18:12.685
Tiny tents.

18:12.687 --> 18:14.736
You got any pictures?
Oh, you know it.

18:14.738 --> 18:16.121
No, no, no, he was just
joking about the pictures.

18:16.123 --> 18:17.256
No, I'd actually like
to see 'em.

18:17.258 --> 18:20.426
Look, Jerry, we were hoping

18:20.428 --> 18:23.178
you could give us some
information on the Royal League.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.180
Royal League.

18:25.182 --> 18:27.266
Those guys were
the Hawaiian Illuminati.

18:27.268 --> 18:28.884
Yeah. Did you ever
see this before?

18:30.720 --> 18:34.573
Yeah, that's the crest
of the Royal League.

18:34.575 --> 18:35.941
Where'd you get this?

18:35.943 --> 18:39.445
It was stolen from a man
named Phillip Van Horn.

18:39.447 --> 18:41.747
Somebody murdered him
and his wife for it.

18:41.749 --> 18:44.783
Van Horn?

18:44.785 --> 18:46.802
Holy Fox Mulder.

18:46.804 --> 18:48.988
Do you guys realize
what this could be?

18:48.990 --> 18:50.155
No.

18:50.157 --> 18:53.242
This could be <i>the</i> key!

18:53.244 --> 18:54.576
You mean, like
a metaphorical key?

18:54.578 --> 18:56.778
No. A very literal key

18:56.780 --> 18:59.798
that opens up a 700-year-old
priceless treasure.

19:00.967 --> 19:02.468
You ever hear of the Medici's?

19:02.470 --> 19:03.618
Uh...

19:03.620 --> 19:05.004
Italy's most powerful and

19:05.006 --> 19:06.388
influential family of all time.

19:06.390 --> 19:07.940
They produced, like, four popes.

19:07.942 --> 19:09.174
No?

19:09.176 --> 19:11.427
All right, well, whatever.

19:11.429 --> 19:13.762
These were the Medici rings.

19:13.764 --> 19:15.597
Crafted in the 1400s,

19:15.599 --> 19:17.799
stolen in the late-1800s.

19:17.801 --> 19:19.685
Now,round the time
of the theft,

19:19.687 --> 19:22.237
a few members of
the Royal League were in Italy.

19:22.239 --> 19:24.073
Jonas Van Horn among them.

19:24.075 --> 19:26.325
He's the family
patriarch.

19:26.327 --> 19:28.810
There were rumors
about their involvement,

19:28.812 --> 19:31.380
but no one has ever been able
to connect them to the rings.

19:31.382 --> 19:32.998
But legend has it,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.701
the League smuggled them out
somehow.

19:35.703 --> 19:37.870
Is there any chance they could
have been smuggled onto Oahu?

19:37.872 --> 19:39.588
That's what I always believed.

19:39.590 --> 19:42.958
But, to this day,
the rings have never been found.

19:42.960 --> 19:47.346
But I bet this is the key
to finding them.

19:47.348 --> 19:48.680
So this is all about

19:48.682 --> 19:50.516
getting their hands on these
rings, and the Van Horns were

19:50.518 --> 19:51.600
just in the way.

19:51.602 --> 19:52.684
Right.
Okay, uh, let's say

19:52.686 --> 19:54.553
I'm buying all of this,
which I am not.

19:54.555 --> 19:57.723
Um, if that scrimshaw is a key,
what does it open?

19:58.942 --> 20:00.509
Answer that, gentlemen,

20:00.511 --> 20:03.645
and you'll solve one
of the world's great mysteries.

20:03.647 --> 20:07.116
I'd settle
for solving our murder.

20:29.100 --> 20:32.236
Here's a list of all known
Royal League members.

20:33.554 --> 20:35.222
Okay, well,
if what you're saying is true,

20:35.224 --> 20:36.690
the people on this list
would have known

20:36.692 --> 20:38.225
about the rings
and where they were hidden.

20:38.227 --> 20:39.610
- Right?
- Good.

20:39.612 --> 20:41.111
All dead. I'll just head
over to the cemetery

20:41.113 --> 20:42.362
and start asking
them questions.

20:42.364 --> 20:43.747
I'll look up

20:43.749 --> 20:45.032
the descendents,
cross-check them

20:45.034 --> 20:47.067
for any criminal activity.
Thank you, Chin.

20:47.069 --> 20:48.585
It's a good start.
You got a better idea?

20:48.587 --> 20:50.921
No, I don't, but

20:50.923 --> 20:53.590
just because some whack job says
that Jimmy Hoffa's buried

20:53.592 --> 20:56.293
under Giants Stadium does not
mean you go digging up the turf.

20:56.295 --> 20:57.594
No offense, Jerry.

20:57.596 --> 20:58.729
None taken.

20:58.731 --> 21:00.848
Hoffa's not buried
under Giants Stadium.

21:00.850 --> 21:02.516
He's under the runway
at LaGuardia.

21:02.518 --> 21:03.851
There you go.

21:03.853 --> 21:05.602
Ah. Well, explain
to me this, then.

21:05.604 --> 21:08.138
Uh, just six months ago,
there was a photograph

21:08.140 --> 21:10.440
of the scrimshaw
published in a magazine.

21:10.442 --> 21:12.526
Why'd the killers wait
till now to go after it?

21:12.528 --> 21:14.528
Why didn't Van Horn go after
the treasure himself?

21:14.530 --> 21:18.182
You're totally my Scully.
Your what?

21:18.184 --> 21:19.483
It's possible Phillip

21:19.485 --> 21:21.034
didn't know what he had
or what the key opened.

21:21.036 --> 21:22.870
Hold on. It's Duke.

21:22.872 --> 21:23.987
Duke? Oh.

21:23.989 --> 21:26.490
Oh. Sorry. Scrambler.

21:28.494 --> 21:30.827
Duke? Yeah, I'm here.

21:32.297 --> 21:34.114
All right, Hewitt Van Horn's
sit-down

21:34.116 --> 21:36.750
with the HPD sketch artist
got us a hit.

21:38.019 --> 21:39.419
The guy who paid
for the security code--

21:39.421 --> 21:40.620
his name is Griffin Moore.

21:40.622 --> 21:42.139
He's got priors.

21:42.141 --> 21:43.840
Counterfeiting,

21:43.842 --> 21:45.225
art fraud
and felony assault.

21:45.227 --> 21:47.460
Okay, thank you, Duke.
Got it.

21:47.462 --> 21:48.478
He could have been the guy

21:48.480 --> 21:49.513
to set up a crew
to hit the Van Horn's.

21:49.515 --> 21:50.964
Yeah. Let's go check it out.

21:50.966 --> 21:54.067
Yeah, you guys do your
thing, and I'll stay here,

21:54.069 --> 21:56.737
keep digging into the legend
of the missing rings.

21:56.739 --> 21:59.573
Good. Say hello
to the Hobbits for me.

22:04.195 --> 22:05.862
Five-O!

22:15.656 --> 22:17.841
Clear.

22:25.266 --> 22:27.701
Got modeling clay
and plaster here.

22:27.703 --> 22:30.487
Looks like Moore was
building something.

22:32.290 --> 22:35.008
Yeah, it looks, uh,
looks like he was doing

22:35.010 --> 22:37.544
a lot more
than that.

22:37.546 --> 22:39.696
What do you got?

22:43.284 --> 22:45.736
Got a GSW to the back
of the skull.

22:45.738 --> 22:50.540
Okay, I'm thinking maybe
Moore got a little greedy

22:50.542 --> 22:52.359
and turned on one of his crew.

22:52.361 --> 22:55.545
Maybe his crew turned on him.

23:52.103 --> 23:54.187
Surprise!

23:56.108 --> 23:57.290
Billy.

23:57.292 --> 23:59.059
What, you think I
was gonna miss this?

23:59.061 --> 24:00.444
And I'd be lying

24:00.446 --> 24:02.195
if I didn't say
I was a little worried

24:02.197 --> 24:03.613
you might have
second thoughts.

24:03.615 --> 24:04.698
Are you kidding me?

24:04.700 --> 24:06.266
I cannot wait to start.

24:06.268 --> 24:08.035
That's what I wanted to hear.

24:08.037 --> 24:10.153
All right, let's
eat some cake.

24:10.155 --> 24:12.439
Yeah.

24:12.441 --> 24:14.624
Yeah, okay, thanks.

24:14.626 --> 24:16.626
Had Lukela put an alert out
on Griffin Moore.

24:16.628 --> 24:18.395
Homeland Security
has been notified.

24:18.397 --> 24:19.730
Whoa.

24:19.732 --> 24:21.965
Oy vay.

24:27.338 --> 24:28.388
Nice outfit, Jerry.

24:28.390 --> 24:31.258
No Jerry here,
just a simple tourist.

24:32.477 --> 24:33.760
I don't leave the house much.

24:33.762 --> 24:34.761
Surveillance issues.

24:34.763 --> 24:37.797
Oh.

24:37.799 --> 24:39.399
Looks like a good
cover, Jerry.

24:39.401 --> 24:40.567
What are you
doing here?

24:40.569 --> 24:42.319
You're not gonna
believe what I found.

24:42.321 --> 24:43.437
A few weeks ago

24:43.439 --> 24:45.439
an auction house
in Florence was robbed.

24:45.441 --> 24:46.990
The thieves made off
with a bunch of letters

24:46.992 --> 24:48.775
from Jonas Van Horn
to an American

24:48.777 --> 24:51.361
living in Florence in 1880
named Daniel Frost.

24:51.363 --> 24:53.029
I contacted one
of my associates,

24:53.031 --> 24:54.164
who prefers
to remain nameless,

24:54.166 --> 24:56.116
and he sent me scans
of the letters.

24:56.118 --> 24:57.150
What do they say?

24:57.152 --> 24:58.201
Nothing.

24:58.203 --> 25:01.121
Nothing about the
scrimshaw key or the rings.

25:01.123 --> 25:02.923
Just some boring stuff
about living in Florence.

25:02.925 --> 25:04.291
Oh, good, so this is all just

25:04.293 --> 25:06.093
an incredibly gigantic
waste of time.

25:06.095 --> 25:08.929
You know, you're the reason
I don't go outside much.

25:08.931 --> 25:10.263
Is that the only reason?

25:10.265 --> 25:12.883
That boring stuff
in the letters--

25:12.885 --> 25:16.336
I think it's probably coded
in some kind of cipher.

25:16.338 --> 25:17.504
Pretty awesome, right?

25:17.506 --> 25:18.855
That's, that's awesome.

25:18.857 --> 25:20.190
And here's
the kicker.

25:20.192 --> 25:23.560
Daniel Frost was an apprentice
to Thomas Gould,

25:23.562 --> 25:25.979
and guess what statue
Thomas Gould

25:25.981 --> 25:28.615
is famous for.

25:28.617 --> 25:30.016
King Kamehameha.

25:30.018 --> 25:32.869
Built in 1880 around the same
time the rings went missing.

25:32.871 --> 25:36.490
I think Daniel Frost helped
Jonas Van Horn smuggle the rings

25:36.492 --> 25:38.024
out of Italy inside the statue,

25:38.026 --> 25:39.876
which means that what
the scrimshaw key opens.

25:39.878 --> 25:42.078
Boo-yah.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.463
Boo-yah?

25:45.500 --> 25:46.633
What?

25:46.635 --> 25:48.502
What, uh, what
are you thinking?

25:48.504 --> 25:51.204
All that modeling clay,
plaster, and paint

25:51.206 --> 25:53.706
that we found
at Moore's place...

25:53.708 --> 25:56.760
I think he was building
a fake King Kamehameha statue.

25:56.762 --> 25:58.211
Why would he do that?

25:58.213 --> 26:00.713
I mean, if he had the key,
why wouldn't he just come here

26:00.715 --> 26:01.932
and open it?
Yeah, but check it out.

26:01.934 --> 26:03.483
I-I-I've looked at this statue

26:03.485 --> 26:05.018
5,000 times in my life, okay?

26:05.020 --> 26:06.419
I've never seen a keyhole.

26:06.421 --> 26:08.155
Have you?
No.

26:08.157 --> 26:09.940
If the treasure is
inside the statue,

26:09.942 --> 26:12.609
There's no way Moore could get
to it without being seen.

26:13.227 --> 26:14.227
Swapping this statue

26:14.229 --> 26:15.612
with a fake is the only way

26:15.614 --> 26:17.897
that he could get to whatever
is inside the statue.

26:17.899 --> 26:19.833
Nice theory.

26:19.835 --> 26:21.334
Only one problem.

26:21.336 --> 26:24.087
Moore's not going after
<i>this</i> King Kamehameha statue.

26:24.089 --> 26:25.622
What, what, what
do you mean?

26:25.624 --> 26:26.923
There's two of these?

26:26.925 --> 26:29.242
The ship with the original
King Kamehameha statue sunk

26:29.244 --> 26:32.128
on its way to Oahu,
so they built a second one--

26:32.130 --> 26:33.513
this one here.

26:33.515 --> 26:34.914
Years later the
original was recovered

26:34.916 --> 26:36.583
and returned to Hawaii.

26:36.585 --> 26:38.251
That's the one
with the rings inside it.

26:38.253 --> 26:39.970
That's the statue
that Moore's after.

26:39.972 --> 26:42.389
Oh, good, okay,
where's that one?

26:52.600 --> 26:54.618
<i>There she is, boys,</i>

26:54.620 --> 26:56.253
the beautiful
Island of Hawaii.

26:56.255 --> 26:58.405
Oh, oh, oh,
eyes forward, please.

26:58.407 --> 26:59.706
Thank you.

27:02.243 --> 27:03.877
You okay, bruddah?

27:03.879 --> 27:05.996
You fly a lot?

27:05.998 --> 27:07.247
All the time.

27:07.249 --> 27:10.217
You ever see
any black helicopters?

27:12.921 --> 27:13.920
Catherine.

27:13.922 --> 27:14.954
Hey.

27:14.956 --> 27:16.089
Hey, thanks for calling me back.

27:16.091 --> 27:17.641
Listen, I need a favor, okay?

27:17.643 --> 27:19.459
I'm gonna send you some letters.

27:19.461 --> 27:21.011
Uh, there may be
a message embedded in them.

27:21.013 --> 27:23.146
I need cryptology
to look them over.

27:23.148 --> 27:25.432
Steve, I was just about
to hand in my paperwork.

27:25.434 --> 27:27.384
Okay, this will only take
a couple of minutes.

27:27.386 --> 27:28.985
All my stuff is packed.

27:28.987 --> 27:30.820
They even got me a cake.

27:30.822 --> 27:31.788
Catherine,

27:31.790 --> 27:33.573
two good people
have been murdered,

27:33.575 --> 27:34.641
and what's in these letters

27:34.643 --> 27:37.143
could help us catch
their killers.

27:37.145 --> 27:39.329
All right, you got it.

27:54.445 --> 27:57.380
It's plaster.

27:57.382 --> 27:59.015
Original is cast in brass.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.051
Wow, you were right.

28:01.053 --> 28:03.053
It is a fake.

28:03.055 --> 28:04.654
Moore already switched
the statues.

28:04.656 --> 28:07.507
Then, where's the real one?

28:20.644 --> 28:22.611
Okay, well, here's what I know.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.680
City maintenance truck
was reported stolen

28:24.682 --> 28:25.848
two nights ago--

28:25.850 --> 28:27.850
the same night
that this footage was taken.

28:28.785 --> 28:31.437
Which means that Moore
switched the statue

28:31.439 --> 28:32.605
before the Van Horns

28:32.607 --> 28:34.006
were murdered.
Okay,

28:34.008 --> 28:35.691
so these three guys-- they
could be our shooters, right?

28:35.693 --> 28:37.142
We know one of them
is Griffin Moore.

28:37.144 --> 28:38.343
Who are the other two?

28:43.066 --> 28:44.700
Wait a minute, Chin.

28:44.702 --> 28:45.684
Moore's not even here.

28:45.686 --> 28:47.069
That's because he's dead.

28:47.871 --> 28:50.039
The skull you found
in the kiln--

28:50.041 --> 28:51.807
the dental records matched
Griffin Moore.

28:51.809 --> 28:52.875
It appears

28:52.877 --> 28:54.877
he die from a gunshot
wound to the head.

28:54.879 --> 28:57.763
Ballistics did confirm that
it matches the same caliber

28:57.765 --> 28:59.748
that was used to
kill the Van Horns.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.050
Hi, I'm Dr. Max Bergman.

29:01.918 --> 29:04.870
Jerry... just Jerry.

29:04.872 --> 29:07.039
He's not big
on last names.

29:07.591 --> 29:08.924
All right, Chin,

29:08.926 --> 29:10.259
let's run facial recognition
on these guys.

29:10.261 --> 29:13.545
Commander, shall we, uh,
step into your office?

29:13.547 --> 29:15.047
Oh, that's it?

29:15.715 --> 29:17.333
Yes, uh, let me know the second

29:17.335 --> 29:19.068
you get a hit.
Yeah.

29:27.060 --> 29:29.078
You found it, huh?

29:29.080 --> 29:30.062
My eBay auction handle

29:30.064 --> 29:31.897
isn't TheRealJediMaxter
for nothing.

29:31.899 --> 29:34.366
Buddy, what
do I owe you?

29:34.368 --> 29:37.453
$1,326.41.

29:37.455 --> 29:39.705
$1,300?

29:39.707 --> 29:41.423
I thought you
were a Jedi.

29:41.425 --> 29:44.593
Commander, I-I don't think
you truly understand the value

29:44.595 --> 29:45.744
of what you have
in your possession.

29:45.746 --> 29:51.266
This is a hot stamper,
a limited pressing.

29:51.268 --> 29:52.935
Catherine is going
to be extremely grateful

29:52.937 --> 29:54.470
when you give it to her.
I'm sure she will,

29:54.472 --> 29:57.690
Max, but $1,300 is a lot
of money, okay, for me.

29:57.692 --> 29:58.974
Well, do you want it
or not?

29:58.976 --> 30:00.526
I...

30:00.528 --> 30:03.896
Yes... yes.

30:05.315 --> 30:06.532
All right.

30:13.206 --> 30:14.940
78-- I have $78, okay?

30:14.942 --> 30:16.575
That's everything I
have today, all right?

30:16.577 --> 30:18.961
I'll pay you the rest
as soon as I get it.

30:18.963 --> 30:20.429
Layaway?

30:20.431 --> 30:22.614
Layaway? No, it's--
you're doing me a favor.

30:22.616 --> 30:24.633
Thank you,
by the way.

30:24.635 --> 30:28.220
Fine, when you have
all the money, then

30:28.222 --> 30:30.923
it will be yours.

30:30.925 --> 30:34.159
You're aware I carry
a gun, right, Max?

30:34.161 --> 30:35.561
Got 'em.

30:35.563 --> 30:37.513
One on the left
is Ellis Gregory.

30:37.515 --> 30:38.981
He's ex-British military.

30:38.983 --> 30:40.315
Interpol's got a lot
of paper on him--

30:40.317 --> 30:42.101
theft, fraud,
assault.

30:42.103 --> 30:43.485
He and his two partners
are wanted

30:43.487 --> 30:44.837
for murder in connection
with a high-end

30:44.839 --> 30:46.288
museum heist
in Prague.

30:46.290 --> 30:47.406
They were
last seen

30:47.408 --> 30:49.358
in Italy
three weeks ago.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.276
Around the same time
that the letters

30:51.278 --> 30:52.661
were stolen from the
auction house in Florence.

30:52.663 --> 30:55.080
So these are
our guys.

30:55.082 --> 30:56.281
Moore was
just a pawn.

30:56.283 --> 30:57.499
He built
the fake statue

30:57.501 --> 30:58.917
and got the Van Horns'
security code.

30:58.919 --> 31:00.485
Yeah, and as soon as
services were rendered,

31:00.487 --> 31:02.037
they shot him and they
dumped him in the oven.

31:02.039 --> 31:03.989
These guys had to have come in
on fake passports.

31:03.991 --> 31:06.291
I'll cross-check their faces
with TSA security cameras.

31:06.293 --> 31:07.342
All right.

31:07.344 --> 31:08.377
Catherine.

31:11.664 --> 31:13.165
You don't say.

31:13.167 --> 31:14.933
No, we're on the way.

31:15.936 --> 31:17.335
You were right, Jerry.

31:17.337 --> 31:19.271
There was a hidden code
inside those letters.

31:20.140 --> 31:21.506
Let's go.

31:28.965 --> 31:31.049
Stevie Wonder,
what are you doing?

31:31.051 --> 31:32.284
If you see something
you shouldn't,

31:32.286 --> 31:34.787
they won't ever
let you leave.

31:34.789 --> 31:37.039
I think you should get
a girlfriend, buddy.

31:37.857 --> 31:39.858
Hey, Cat.
Hey.

31:41.194 --> 31:42.694
Jerry, you can
open your eyes.

31:44.697 --> 31:46.698
This is Jerry--
he is

31:46.700 --> 31:48.217
our special consultant.

31:48.219 --> 31:49.201
Yeah,

31:49.203 --> 31:50.368
Roswell division.

31:50.370 --> 31:52.488
It's nice to meet you,
Jerry, I'm Catherine.

31:52.490 --> 31:55.707
Uh, why don't you
guys come this way?

31:55.709 --> 31:57.176
She'll do.

31:57.178 --> 31:58.260
Oh, no, no, no, listen,

31:58.262 --> 32:00.145
her, uh, boyfriend is
a complete animal.

32:00.147 --> 32:02.714
You want to stay away
from that one, trust me.

32:02.716 --> 32:03.766
Okay,

32:03.768 --> 32:04.900
so the correspondences

32:04.902 --> 32:06.568
between Frost and Van Horn

32:06.570 --> 32:08.821
were intentionally innocuous.

32:08.823 --> 32:09.988
I called that.

32:09.990 --> 32:12.741
When we analyzed the text
using a frequency count,

32:12.743 --> 32:15.644
certain words kept
appearing in a sequence.

32:16.763 --> 32:19.081
Did you apply

32:19.083 --> 32:21.500
a transposition cipher?

32:21.502 --> 32:22.668
Yes, we did.

32:22.670 --> 32:24.286
I'm impressed; you
know your stuff.

32:24.921 --> 32:26.571
Thanks.

32:27.674 --> 32:30.676
So, using that cipher,
we isolated every second letter

32:30.678 --> 32:32.845
of the remaining words.

32:36.216 --> 32:37.249
I don't get it.

32:37.251 --> 32:38.634
Looks like one of those
word search puzzles.

32:38.636 --> 32:40.219
No, no, no, it's not a puzzle.

32:40.221 --> 32:41.436
It's a scytale.

32:42.806 --> 32:46.308
Uh, imagine
a 19th century Rubik's Cube,

32:46.310 --> 32:47.442
only instead
of a square,

32:47.444 --> 32:48.927
it's a horizontal cylinder,

32:48.929 --> 32:51.947
and instead of matching colors,
you're creating words.

32:51.949 --> 32:53.282
Exactly,

32:53.284 --> 32:56.618
and once you rotate the
letters around the cylinder...

32:58.738 --> 33:02.274
...it reveals a hidden message.

33:03.726 --> 33:04.827
Without a computer,
something like this

33:04.829 --> 33:06.545
would take months to decode.

33:08.781 --> 33:10.532
Look at that.

33:11.301 --> 33:13.302
"Beneath the King's...

33:13.304 --> 33:14.953
"heavy right foot...

33:14.955 --> 33:16.438
"a leaf reveals...

33:16.440 --> 33:17.806
"with a turn...

33:17.808 --> 33:20.843
the truth within."

33:21.978 --> 33:24.462
I was right.

33:24.464 --> 33:26.982
Oof. I think I need to sit down.

33:26.984 --> 33:28.567
Wait a minute,
the rings...

33:28.569 --> 33:30.235
are under the
king's foot.

33:30.237 --> 33:32.304
That's why they had to switch
the statue out, right?

33:32.306 --> 33:34.189
They had to get beneath it.

33:34.191 --> 33:35.224
Chin, what do you got?

33:35.226 --> 33:36.975
Our suspects
<i>did</i> enter the country

33:36.977 --> 33:39.011
using aliases,
and when they arrived

33:39.013 --> 33:40.612
in Honolulu, they rented a van.

33:40.614 --> 33:43.749
I pinged it, and I'm
sending you the location now.

33:45.535 --> 33:47.202
Hey!

33:51.925 --> 33:53.342
Get up. Get up.

33:53.793 --> 33:54.960
Get up. Get up.

33:54.962 --> 33:56.428
Get up.

33:56.430 --> 33:58.663
Get up. Get up.

34:02.602 --> 34:04.219
What...? I'm bleeding.

34:04.221 --> 34:06.188
Yeah, I can see that.

34:06.190 --> 34:08.857
Watch my shoes.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.574
Danny, we got
the big boy here.

34:38.972 --> 34:40.339
Hey.

34:40.341 --> 34:43.175
You haven't opened
the statue yet, have you?

34:43.177 --> 34:45.143
Huh?

34:45.145 --> 34:46.210
Hey, you haven't opened

34:46.213 --> 34:48.063
the statue yet, right?
Hey, hey.

34:48.065 --> 34:49.848
Where are
your partners?

34:51.650 --> 34:53.902
You don't want to talk.

34:53.904 --> 34:56.772
You're a lot smarter
than you look, mate.

34:56.774 --> 34:59.074
Okay.

34:59.076 --> 35:01.743
Here's the thing, uh, you
like orphaning little kids,

35:01.745 --> 35:03.078
I like shooting bad guys.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.247
Everybody goes home
happy, right?

35:05.249 --> 35:07.565
You okay with this? Huh?
100%.

35:07.567 --> 35:09.418
- You two are crazy.
- Yeah.

35:09.420 --> 35:10.836
You can't do that.

35:11.671 --> 35:14.039
Why haven't you opened
the statue yet?

35:14.041 --> 35:16.508
Why haven't you opened
the statue yet?

35:16.510 --> 35:20.345
'Cause we didn't want to risk
damaging the rings.

35:21.547 --> 35:22.731
We need the key.

35:22.733 --> 35:25.717
The key wasn't
at the house, was it?

35:25.719 --> 35:27.269
Huh?
You tore the place up

35:27.271 --> 35:29.187
but you couldn't find it,
right? You killed

35:29.189 --> 35:30.922
two innocent people for no
reason, you understand that?

35:30.924 --> 35:32.975
Two innocent people
for no reason.

35:32.977 --> 35:34.226
If you don't have it,
where is it?

35:34.228 --> 35:35.277
Where are your partners, huh?

35:35.279 --> 35:36.395
They out looking for it?

35:36.397 --> 35:37.980
Hey. Look at me.

35:37.982 --> 35:39.982
I'm gonna shoot you,
I swear to God. Now, tell me

35:39.984 --> 35:43.535
where your partners are right now--
it's the last time I'm gonna ask you.

35:48.124 --> 35:49.825
Sorry.

35:49.827 --> 35:51.994
It's all right, love.

36:27.254 --> 36:29.287
Everybody, out, out.

36:29.289 --> 36:30.989
Police. Out of the building.
Go, go, go.

36:30.991 --> 36:33.408
Get out of the building.

36:35.127 --> 36:37.212
Get these kids out of here
right now.

36:37.214 --> 36:38.613
Out. Out.

36:40.449 --> 36:41.833
Hey! Five-O!

36:41.835 --> 36:43.168
Get down!

36:50.059 --> 36:51.726
I got him!

37:25.094 --> 37:26.928
You have been in a terrible
motorcycle accident.

37:26.930 --> 37:28.096
It's unadvisable
that you stand up.

37:28.098 --> 37:29.731
Put your hands behind your back,
both of them.

37:29.733 --> 37:30.965
Both hands behind
your back.

37:30.967 --> 37:32.667
Keep your face down.

37:37.239 --> 37:38.640
On your knees.

37:38.642 --> 37:41.276
On your knees.
On your knees and cross your legs.

37:41.278 --> 37:42.727
Cross your legs.

37:42.729 --> 37:45.063
Duke.

37:56.292 --> 37:57.659
Uh...

37:57.661 --> 38:01.079
Oh, let me guess, uh,
"Book 'em, Danno"?

38:01.081 --> 38:03.548
Would you mind?
No, no, no. My pleasure.

38:03.550 --> 38:05.049
Thanks.
Up. Up.

38:05.051 --> 38:06.885
Up, up, up, up, up.

38:17.513 --> 38:20.682
The honor's all yours.

38:24.270 --> 38:27.689
Now I know how Geraldo felt
before he opened

38:27.691 --> 38:29.841
- Capone's secret vault.
- Well, if it's empty,

38:29.843 --> 38:31.492
at least ten million
people aren't watching,

38:31.494 --> 38:32.994
right?

39:06.695 --> 39:09.614
After 150 years...

39:09.616 --> 39:14.402
the three rings of the Medici
have finally been found.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.373
I never doubted you
for a minute, Jerry.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.742
Neither did I.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.462
How do you feel?

39:24.464 --> 39:26.447
Ooh, it's weird.

39:26.449 --> 39:28.666
I've never proven
anything before.

39:29.969 --> 39:32.220
Ever.
Well, that's not bad

39:32.222 --> 39:33.388
for a first.

39:33.390 --> 39:35.840
These...

39:35.842 --> 39:39.093
need to be sent to Italy,
and put on display at the Uffizi

39:39.095 --> 39:40.461
so everyone can see.

39:41.797 --> 39:42.897
You have my word.

39:42.899 --> 39:45.316
Thank you.

39:45.318 --> 39:47.435
No, Jerry, thank <i>you,</i> buddy.

39:47.437 --> 39:49.804
If it wasn't for you, we
would never have found this.

39:49.806 --> 39:51.839
I love you, guys.

39:51.841 --> 39:54.275
Oh. Okay, Jerry.

39:56.578 --> 39:57.812
Oh.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.115
All right, man.

40:04.036 --> 40:07.288
Hey, we make a great team.
We should do this again.

40:07.290 --> 40:09.457
You guys ever read
the Warren Commission?

40:11.293 --> 40:13.511
We'll call you, Jerry.

40:13.513 --> 40:15.847
Handwritten letters are better.

40:15.849 --> 40:19.550
I don't do phones.

40:51.967 --> 40:52.917
Hey.

40:52.919 --> 40:55.002
Hey, how you doing?
Hi.

40:55.004 --> 40:59.206
This, this is a little monkey that
belonged to my daughter.

40:59.208 --> 41:02.710
She, uh, outgrew it, so I
thought maybe she would like it.

41:02.712 --> 41:04.712
What do you think? Huh?

41:04.714 --> 41:06.347
Yeah, of course you do.

41:06.349 --> 41:08.149
Yeah. It's a match.

41:08.151 --> 41:11.519
Got a monkey for a monkey. Okay.

41:11.521 --> 41:13.604
Mahalo.

41:16.492 --> 41:18.659
All right, guys.

41:24.617 --> 41:26.084
Catherine.

41:26.086 --> 41:27.535
Hey.
Hey.

41:27.537 --> 41:29.203
Um, I'm glad
I caught you.

41:29.205 --> 41:31.906
Just, uh...
real quick.

41:31.908 --> 41:34.125
Wow, it's wrapped
and everything.

41:34.127 --> 41:35.460
I'm impressed.

41:35.462 --> 41:37.178
Go ahead, open it.

41:37.180 --> 41:38.679
Aw, you didn't have to do this.

41:38.681 --> 41:40.581
I know.

41:49.691 --> 41:51.926
I remember you told me
a story about when you

41:51.928 --> 41:53.611
were little girl
and your, uh,

41:53.613 --> 41:56.597
your mom would play this for
you when you were scared.

41:59.451 --> 42:02.120
Chicago always made
everything better.

42:05.824 --> 42:08.126
Catherine...

42:08.128 --> 42:11.078
you got nothing to be scared of.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.547
Okay?

42:14.115 --> 42:15.633
I'm right here.

42:15.635 --> 42:17.919
You're not gonna do this alone.

42:18.787 --> 42:21.038
Thank you.

42:25.293 --> 42:28.763
<i>The Navy takes great pleasure</i>
