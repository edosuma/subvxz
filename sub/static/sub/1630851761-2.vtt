<i>Larry, we are so
excited about this show. Right?</i>

00:15.473 --> 00:16.933
- We've been talking about it...
- Cool.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.351
-...all week long.
- Is that so?

00:18.435 --> 00:20.186
All right, so just a little bit
of housekeeping right up front,

00:20.270 --> 00:21.688
uh, on the casting side
of things,

00:21.771 --> 00:24.983
you guys are pretty keen
on this particular young woman

00:25.066 --> 00:26.401
to play Marsha Lifshitz, right?

00:26.484 --> 00:28.570
- Uh, what's the...
Maria Sofia Estrada.

00:28.653 --> 00:31.698
Maria Sofia Estrada. Yeah.
Where'd you find her?

00:32.866 --> 00:33.908
Oh...

00:33.992 --> 00:36.745
- We couldn't find her on IMDB.
- Is she on TikTok?

00:36.828 --> 00:39.456
- Does she do theater?
- Does she do theater?

00:40.623 --> 00:43.126
Does she do theater!
You know what?

00:43.209 --> 00:44.794
Okay. Are you ready?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.129
- Yeah.
All right.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.089
A friend of mine,
his daughter goes to high school

00:48.173 --> 00:50.800
and they're doing a high school
production of <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

00:50.884 --> 00:53.470
and his daughter
was playing Mrs. Montague.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.805
He asked me if I wanted to go.
Sure, I'll go.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.474
I love theater. Okay? Sue me.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.268
What-- what-- what am I, crazy?
I just love it, you know?

01:00.351 --> 01:02.604
I just-- I sit there,
and I go, "Whoa!"

01:02.687 --> 01:05.982
It's theater, you know.
It's all alive. It's happening.

01:06.065 --> 01:08.401
But anyway, his daughter,
sorry to say,

01:08.485 --> 01:10.069
she just, you know,
didn't have it.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.446
- But..
Mm?

01:11.529 --> 01:13.448
...the girl playing Juliet. Oh!

01:13.531 --> 01:16.534
My God, she was sensational.

01:18.369 --> 01:19.579
Can you guys believe it?

01:19.662 --> 01:21.956
My daughter's gonna be the star
of Larry David's new show.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.878
I mean, she was incredible.
I went backstage.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.923
I saw my friend's daughter.
I said, "Y--y--y-- very good,

01:30.006 --> 01:31.424
- where's Juliet?" You know.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.427
And I went to find Juliet,
and she came in to audition.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.679
- She's like a discovery.
- Oh, so she read
for you already?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.389
- She read, yes.
Oh, wow.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.476
- Oh! The electricity
in the room, forget about it.
- Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:41.559 --> 01:42.852
I'd love to see the tape.

01:46.815 --> 01:47.816
Well...

01:48.566 --> 01:51.653
I, um, I did not tell you this.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.071
What?

01:53.154 --> 01:56.324
I accidentally
erased the tape yesterday.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.910
I know.
I've been hesitant to tell you.

01:58.993 --> 02:01.329
Oh, my God, Jeff,
why did you do that?

02:01.412 --> 02:02.831
- You fucking idiot.
- Yeah, I know.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.041
- You're a fucking idiot,
you know that?
- Can I tell you something?

02:05.124 --> 02:06.251
- It's all right.
Yeah.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.752
- I am. I am.
- You are.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.213
I am. I'm a fucking idiot.
I'm so sorry.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.465
So no tape? Okay. Um...

02:12.549 --> 02:14.717
Who told you the tape--
Who told you to futz with it?

02:14.801 --> 02:17.137
- Look, I got a little crazy.
- You got a little crazy.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.347
- What do you want from me?
- Yeah, shut up. Just shut up.

02:19.430 --> 02:23.059
Bit of a ray of sunshine then.
Um, we have a kid we think

02:23.143 --> 02:26.980
- is fantastic for Young Larry.
- Is that so?

02:27.063 --> 02:28.773
- Yeah. He's...
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.608
Dylan O'Brien,
you guys know Dylan O'Brien?

02:30.692 --> 02:32.068
- Dylan O'Brien.
He's so hot right now.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.444
He was in <i>Teen Wolf.</i>

02:33.528 --> 02:35.238
Uh, he's in the <i>Maze Runner</i>
trilogies.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.948
- We think he's Young Larry.
- Yeah.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.242
Attaching someone
like Dylan,

02:39.325 --> 02:41.619
- this show goes
for a very long time.
- Uh-huh.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.663
So, look, he's in a band.
He's got a little pet project.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.707
It's Dylan O'Brien
and the Entrails.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.041
- You know.
They're great.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.668
Yeah. They are--
They're actually pretty good.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.462
And he plays guitar and drums.
Come to the show tomorrow,

02:51.546 --> 02:52.881
you know, bunch of
young people will be...

02:52.964 --> 02:55.717
- He's gonna be singing?
- Yeah. Yeah. He's gonna sing.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.260
If you're going, I'm going.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.179
- You going?
- So, you'll go?

03:02.265 --> 03:04.100
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.978
Rock concert?
Can't stand rock concerts.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.480
This is pure torture for me,
honestly.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.190
So loud, you know?

03:11.274 --> 03:13.735
It's a nightclub. There's not
even gonna be places to sit.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.487
Exact-- and-- and we're gonna
have to go backstage

03:16.571 --> 03:19.616
and pretend that we liked it,
and it's...

03:19.699 --> 03:21.284
- Ow. What the--
- Who needs that shit?

03:21.367 --> 03:22.952
Geez.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.830
Fuckin' tooth is killing me,
man.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.082
- You got a good dentist?
- He retired.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.293
He did? I got the guy for you.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.503
Really?
- Dr. Thanapapalous.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.298
- He's fantastic.
- Well, maybe I'll go to him.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.716
You gotta go to him.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.092
However, if you do go,

03:38.176 --> 03:40.136
uh, there's a young lady
named Angie.

03:40.219 --> 03:43.056
Uh, great girl. Great hygienist.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.142
I got her pregnant.

03:46.225 --> 03:49.437
And, uh, she got an abortion.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.148
- And, uh, yeah.
- Wow.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.233
- Wow. Sorry. Holy cow.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.569
- One big headache.
- You paid for the abortion?

03:56.653 --> 03:58.780
- Of course I paid
for the abortion.
Yeah, of course.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.992
Geez.
What are you supposed to do?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.744
She's beautiful,
flirted with me.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.205
- What am I gonna do?
- What do you got
going for you?

04:07.288 --> 04:08.206
I don't get it.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.832
By the way,
I don't question it.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.835
- So that's over now?
- Yeah. We're not dating anymore.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.212
All right.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.964
Pee before you leave,
that's my credo.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.173
It's a good credo.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.277
Come on in. Hey.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.154
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, no. Not at all.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.697
- We were talking about you.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.199
I just wanted to let you know
that I was using

05:25.283 --> 05:27.577
- the, uh, the unisex bathroom.
- Yeah.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.329
The toilet seat
does not stay up.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.540
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- You know, I was climbing

05:32.623 --> 05:34.083
- on the rim, okay?
- Oh. Oh.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.752
Then I was holding it up
with my foot

05:35.835 --> 05:37.628
because that thing
can't come down in midstream

05:37.712 --> 05:40.298
'cause, you know, I don't have
the urethral discipline

05:40.381 --> 05:41.924
I had when I was a youth.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.760
- You know? So...

05:43.843 --> 05:46.596
But it beat the alternative,
which is sitting,

05:46.679 --> 05:48.264
pants on the floor,
you know what?

05:48.347 --> 05:50.600
Those pants go right
in the incinerator.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.061
I swear to you, if those pants
touch that floor,

05:53.144 --> 05:54.520
I'm going home in my underwear.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.190
- That's fantastic.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.691
- Anyway--
- Yeah. I-- I-- you know what?

05:58.775 --> 06:00.068
Thank you for bringing it
to our attention.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.778
- I will talk to maintenance.
- You'll talk to maintenance?

06:01.861 --> 06:03.488
Absolutely.
You got it. We're on it.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.989
Okay, you go back
to your business.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.616
- All right, take care.
Okay.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.367
Thanks, Larry.
Bye, Larry.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.621
And you're going to Asia
with this guy?

06:11.704 --> 06:13.372
You don't even know him
from a hole in the wall.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.084
I like adventure.
New places. New man.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.752
- I don't know.
- See new things. Fuck yeah.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.796
Yeah.
- I call her Deuce. Number two.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.007
- Mary Ferguson Two.
- That's right.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.592
By the way,
let me give you a little tip.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.676
Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.303
- You're gonna be with this guy?
Yeah?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.805
Don't walk into any glass doors.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.765
- I'll try not to.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.767
Okay. Well, I'm still hungry.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.187
- My steak was amazing. So good.
- Are you gonna finish it?

06:36.270 --> 06:38.106
Uh, no, I'm gonna save that
for my dog.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.190
Oh.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.402
Can I have some?

06:43.486 --> 06:45.613
Uh, no, I'm gonna give it
to my dog.

06:45.696 --> 06:46.989
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.076
- I can't have a piece of that?
- No, taking it in a doggie bag.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.286
Right now, that dog
is sitting home anticipating

06:52.370 --> 06:53.746
a doggie bag coming home.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.582
They're not expecting five
slices. Got five slices there.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.001
What if you brought home
three slices and gave me two,

06:59.085 --> 07:00.044
would that kill anybody?

07:00.128 --> 07:02.004
No, I'm gonna take it all
for my dog.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.340
Humans should take precedence
over an animal.

07:04.423 --> 07:07.802
But pets should take precedence
over someone I just met.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.054
- So you're not gonna
give me any?
- No.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.515
- Okay.
- Makes sense to me.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.891
You know what makes sense to me?

07:13.975 --> 07:16.310
If you wanna give
your dog all your steak,

07:17.103 --> 07:18.521
perhaps...

07:18.604 --> 07:20.314
perhaps you should pay for it.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.358
Wow.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.861
- Wow?
- Wow.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.947
No, no, no. That's not "wow".
This is wow.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.408
No, asking me to pay. Wow. Wow.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.743
No, no, no.
Dog over man. That's the wow.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.829
No, it's, um, "Oh, I want you
to pay for this meal."

07:34.912 --> 07:36.247
- That's a wow.
- Yeah. No, no.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.291
"I'm gonna give my dog
five slices of my steak

07:38.374 --> 07:40.877
- and not this guy." Wow.
Oh, oh--

07:40.960 --> 07:42.461
- That's wow.
-"Oh, you should pay
for the bill,"

07:42.545 --> 07:44.422
- yeah, no, that's wow.
"Go pay for the bill."
- Oh, no. Wow. Wow.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.882
- I got the wow.
- I got the wow.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.967
That's not the wow!
That's not the wow!

07:48.050 --> 07:50.219
<i>That's not the wow!
That's not the wow!</i>

07:50.303 --> 07:52.930
So listen, I don't know
what to make of this.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.266
Angie told me
she's having complications

07:55.349 --> 07:58.394
- and she needs more money.
- From the abortion? Jesus.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.355
- Wow.
- What complications?

08:01.439 --> 08:03.649
Man, oh, man, that sounds a--

08:03.733 --> 08:05.484
That sounds a tad suspicious.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.486
She might be taking
complete advantage of me.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.031
How are you supposed to know?
She could say anything.

08:10.114 --> 08:13.367
Right. That's why
you're on a secret mission.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.911
When you're at the dentist,

08:14.994 --> 08:16.954
you need to find out
what's going on.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.665
So when you go there,
keep an eye out.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.751
Hey, Jeff?
- Oh, you know,
but you say he's good.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.377
But that touchdown
wasn't a touchdown.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.587
- No, no.
- No way.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.923
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Oh, we got to go, uh,

08:27.006 --> 08:29.342
see that kid play at a concert.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.928
- The young actor--
- Oh, the actor for the show.
Yeah. Yeah.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.931
- We got the new towels. Fluffy.
- Oh, they're beautiful.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.099
Feel this, new fluffy towels.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.435
- Not like your ratty old towels.
- What?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.562
What'd you say about my towels?

08:41.646 --> 08:43.272
I said not like
your ratty old towels.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.399
Ratty towels?
I have ratty towels?

08:45.483 --> 08:46.609
Well, it's just a fact, Larry--

08:46.692 --> 08:48.569
It's not a fact,
my towels are not ratty.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.946
Well, don't take such offense.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.739
We get new towels
every few years.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.115
You need to get some new towels.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.243
No, you're wrong.
I don't need new towels.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.453
Towels are better
when they're washed

08:57.536 --> 08:59.413
over and over again,
like a pair of jeans.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.499
- They dry you a lot better.
- Okay.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.584
They're aged.
Because new doesn't dry.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.045
You pat dry, I rub dry.
That's the difference.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.756
You wanna keep patting dry,
you have the rest of your life,

09:08.839 --> 09:10.591
go pat dry,
because you don't know

09:10.675 --> 09:12.385
the pleasures of a rub dry.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.136
Well, you know
I love the fluffy towel.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.888
You love a fluffy.
- Oh, my God.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.683
But when I wanna do a quick dry,
and thorough,

09:18.766 --> 09:20.309
I'd love to have
some aged towels.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.436
- Can we keep a couple aged?
- All right, you see what
you're doing now?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.480
You're turning him
against my nice new towels.

09:24.563 --> 09:27.275
- I didn't need your butt-insky.
- All right, come on.
We better go.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.568
We're not keeping
the old towels!

09:34.865 --> 09:37.118
Can I get a champagne, please?

09:37.201 --> 09:41.289
Oh, my Lord. Look at this.
Look who's here.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.957
- What?
- Fancy meeting you here.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.250
I know. How's it going?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.669
- Good. What are you doing here?
- I came to watch Dylan.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.379
My friend Anne is his publicist,

09:48.462 --> 09:49.964
so I've known him
for a very long ti--

09:50.047 --> 09:50.965
What are you doing here?

09:51.048 --> 09:52.967
We're scouting
this, uh, Dylan O'Brien,

09:53.050 --> 09:54.385
maybe he's gonna be
in our show.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.178
Oh. Well, it's fun
to be here, right?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.638
- It's kind of seedy.
Yeah.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.765
A little ratty,
like your towels.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.059
What?

10:02.143 --> 10:03.936
When I say ratty,
I think of your towels.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.316
Like my towels?
Ratty like my towels?

10:08.399 --> 10:09.900
Did Susie talk to you
about my towels? Huh?

10:09.984 --> 10:11.235
I'm just saying
your towels are old and ratty.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.820
- That's all I'm saying.
- Did Susie say that

10:12.903 --> 10:14.989
- to you recently, huh?
- Does it matter?
I'm just saying.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.449
Don't talk about my towels,

10:16.532 --> 10:18.242
and don't say they're ratty,
'cause they're not ratty.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.578
- Don't say the word ratty?
- No, don't say the word ratty.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.788
Don't use them
in your analogies anymore

10:22.872 --> 10:23.998
if something is ratty.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.833
A ratty towel has holes in it

10:25.916 --> 10:27.877
and you use it
to-- to clean up vomit.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.295
So let's just agree to disagree.

10:29.378 --> 10:30.629
No, I don't agree to disagree.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.632
I disagree to disagree,
and I don't wanna hear it again.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.473
I love you, Dylan! Whoo!

10:40.556 --> 10:42.391
- Enjoy the show. We'll see you.
You too.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.020

- My ears are bleeding.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.878
This is really one of the worst
experiences of my life,

11:10.961 --> 11:11.921
I'm not exaggerating.

The last peaches verse,
I think, best we've ever done.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.138
And we--
and we're gonna run with it.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.431
- Hey!
- This fucking guy!

12:03.514 --> 12:04.849
- What's going on?
- That was fantastic!

12:04.932 --> 12:06.475
- Is that so?
- Oh, my God. We loved it.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.768
It was amazing.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.980
Oh, I was clapping and swaying
and clapping and swaying.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.606
You have no idea
how much that means to me.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.442
I'm so emotional.
It makes me connected to you.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.985
You know what I'm saying?
I'm sorry.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.195
What are you, uh...
You got, like, hearing aids?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.072
You got fucking tissue
in your ear.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.992
- Is that to block sound? No?
- Oh!

12:23.075 --> 12:26.120
- Oh! Look at that!
- Can you believe?

12:26.203 --> 12:28.789
-"Hey, loved the show.
Loved the show."
- Oh, my God, look at that.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.708
"Loved it so much,
I put fucking tissue in my ear."

12:30.791 --> 12:32.042
- No, no, no--
- Definitely not in there

12:32.126 --> 12:33.586
to block the sound out
of the show?

12:33.669 --> 12:35.754
- Don't wanna hear it.
- Oh, no. There was a guy

12:35.838 --> 12:37.131
standing behind me.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.257
- Huh.
- So loud...

12:38.340 --> 12:39.925
- Screaming in my ear.
- Screaming in the ear.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.385
And he was drowning out
the show.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.928
Okay.
- And this way, I was able

12:43.012 --> 12:45.556
to drown him out
and still get the essence.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.892
I think you're full of shit
a little bit.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.311
To tell you the truth,
it was a tad loud for us, okay?

12:50.394 --> 12:51.937
All right.
See, that's all you got to say.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.814
We don't get music.
It's not our thing.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.817
Okay.
- We're-- You know,
we want you for your acting.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.360
All right. Listen, I'll give
you one more shot.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.653
You say you're a fan
of my acting?

12:59.737 --> 13:02.031
- Yeah. Yeah.
- What performance of mine

13:02.114 --> 13:03.324
really resonated with you?

13:03.407 --> 13:04.783
- Of your acting?
- Yeah.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.368
Oh, you know, the-- the--

13:06.452 --> 13:08.370
- What have you seen?
- I've seen, uh...

13:08.454 --> 13:10.831
- You like the show?
- You know, the one
where you were

13:10.915 --> 13:12.541
- in the kitchen cooking.
- Yeah?

13:14.126 --> 13:16.045
- The boat movie.
- Yeah. There's no boat.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.671
- There's no kitchen.
- You never cooked

13:17.755 --> 13:19.381
- chicken alfredo with a friend?
No.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.883
See, my art means a lot to me.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.051
- Okay?
Uh-huh.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.761
Something I do out there
every time is profound.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.221
Did you write
that "Peaches" song?

13:25.304 --> 13:27.097
No. Technically I didn't write
the "Peaches" song.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.390
Huh. Okay.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.435
What would prompt a person
to sing such an idiotic song?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.229
Because the way it's aged
20 years later,

13:33.312 --> 13:34.939
don't you see
how relevant it is now?

13:35.022 --> 13:36.148
- No, I don't.
- Okay.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.942
- See, I can take the honesty.
- Yeah. You can take it.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.361
- I can take criticism, you know?
- Of course. Yeah.
You should be able to.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.112
- What great artist couldn't?
- Name one who could.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.739
- I'll tell you what.
You're looking at him.
- Yeah?

13:43.822 --> 13:45.783
- You want the straight dope?
- Give it to me. I promise you.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.326
I can take it.
I'm ready to grow.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.536
- In two words...
- Yeah.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.954
-...it stunk.
- Go fuck yourself.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.372
I thought you said
you could take it.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.166
You think that you've got a shot
in hell at me doing the show?

13:54.250 --> 13:56.043
- No, no, no.
- Listen,

13:56.126 --> 13:58.254
- let's just cut the cord, okay?
- Okay, yeah.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.755
I'm a kind person, all right?

13:59.838 --> 14:02.383
I'm a very peaceful guy.
Dogs are my life, right?

14:02.466 --> 14:04.760
I started a restaurant
where you can sit

14:04.843 --> 14:07.763
and eat a meal with your dog
next to you outside.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.140
- First of its kind.
- You didn't start the first one.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.851
- I see people sitting outdoor--
- Show me one place.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.937
Name one, name one other
restaurant that does that.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.605
Where you can
bring your dog outside.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.439
Burger King.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.941
- I gotta be honest.
Yeah?

14:19.024 --> 14:21.151
I took an edible
as soon as the show ended,

14:21.235 --> 14:22.695
and it's really
starting to kick in,

14:22.778 --> 14:24.989
so I kind of need to get
in my zone right now.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.116
- Do some yoga, do some MDMA.
Okay. Yeah. Got it.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.076
You sure you didn't take
that edible before the show?

14:29.159 --> 14:32.663
- Get the fuck out, okay?
- Okay. Sure.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.832
I got a call
from his manager, Larry,

14:34.915 --> 14:37.501
and, um, Dylan was offended.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.044
- Ah.
Yeah.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.796
Dylan is someone,
as I said before,

14:40.879 --> 14:43.966
that we are very high on
at the network.

14:44.049 --> 14:47.386
I'm not sure, after the
conversations that we've had,

14:47.469 --> 14:50.681
that this show
works without Dylan.

14:50.764 --> 14:52.975
You know what? I like the kid.
- He's great, right?

14:53.058 --> 14:54.351
I liked his personality.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.353
- Very charming. Funny.
Great.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.939
Qualities I think I had
when I was a young man, right?

14:59.023 --> 15:00.441
I think he's a perfect fit
for the show.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.192
I see him as Young Larry!

15:02.276 --> 15:04.862
- So do we, so do we.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.947
So what I think
would be appropriate

15:07.031 --> 15:10.367
is, um, you know, some sort
of apology, some sort of...

15:10.451 --> 15:12.494
- I will apologize.
Fantastic.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.621
See that palm?

15:13.704 --> 15:15.623
That's what he's gonna be
eating out of very soon.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.250
Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that

15:18.334 --> 15:20.794
because if we can land someone
like Dylan, you know,

15:20.878 --> 15:23.255
that helps us work
with your unknown,

15:23.339 --> 15:25.424
- Maria Sofia Estrada.
- Maria Sofia.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.843
Which you guys
are still leaning towards?

15:27.926 --> 15:29.803
- Absolutely.
- Oh! Oh, my God.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.347
That performance...

15:31.430 --> 15:32.598
We were wondering, um,

15:32.681 --> 15:34.683
because it came up
from our morning meeting,

15:34.767 --> 15:38.020
would she, uh...
Would she go back on tape?

15:38.103 --> 15:40.981
They wanna see tape, huh?
You wanna see tape?

15:41.065 --> 15:42.107
Yeah.
- We'd love to.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.901
- We'll get you tape!
- Great!

15:43.984 --> 15:45.444
Get out of here.
Of course, we'll get you tape.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.072
- That would be great.
- Unfortunately...

15:48.155 --> 15:51.659
can't do it right away,
because she's out of town, so...

15:51.742 --> 15:53.952
We can send her equipment.
We can get her a tripod.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.538
She can shoot on a phone.
- Yeah, her iPhone's fine.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.540
Very busy, very busy.
She's too busy.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.501
Did she get a gig,
is she on set someplace?

16:00.584 --> 16:02.711
No, no. She's, uh,
she's doing, um,

16:02.795 --> 16:05.005
- Habitat for Humanity
- Habitat for Humanity.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.882
- Oh. Wow.
- Well, good for her. Wow.

16:06.965 --> 16:09.009
- That's commendable.
Pretty great, right?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.427
Where's she doing that?

16:10.511 --> 16:12.930
- In New Mexico. Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.057
Uh, why there?

16:15.140 --> 16:17.309
Well, it's close to Mexico.

16:17.393 --> 16:21.188
And, uh, she's got family
across the border

16:21.271 --> 16:26.360
and, um, they like the fact
that she's working nearby.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.112
Okay. Well, you know,
as soon as she's free,

16:28.195 --> 16:30.531
we'd love to get her back
on tape, and that would, um...

16:30.614 --> 16:32.408
- That would-- That would--
- All right. Well, thank you.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.993
Yeah. Thank you guys--
- Oh, you know, um...

16:35.077 --> 16:37.955
Just... one more thing
before we go.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.039
Yeah.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.209
I used that unisex bathroom
before the meeting.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.919
- Mm-hmm.
And I noticed

16:44.002 --> 16:46.964
that the seat,
it's still not staying up.

16:47.047 --> 16:47.881
Oh.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.259
Did you talk
to the maintenance guy?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.886
Uh, yeah, I did,
right after we spoke.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.097
Hm. You know, it's an odd thing.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.099
'Cause those maintenance guys,
they're usually right on it,

16:57.182 --> 16:58.475
you tell them something,
they do it right away,

16:58.559 --> 17:01.603
especially from, you know,
the big-- the big cheese.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.397
It's a big building.
You know?

17:03.480 --> 17:04.732
Lots of, uh... Lots of things.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.275
- All right. Sounds good.
Yeah.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.901
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right. Great.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.820

Nope. Got to come up

Oh, yeah?
And you also work here?

17:27.671 --> 17:29.673
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, you spoke to Don Jr.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.550
about the toilet seat
that, uh, won't stay up?

17:31.633 --> 17:35.137
No. No one said anything
about a broken toilet seat.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.139
Don Jr. didn't talk to you
about a toilet seat

17:37.222 --> 17:38.891
on the sixth floor bathroom
that won't stay up?

17:38.974 --> 17:41.977
Nobody's talked to me about
a toilet that doesn't stay up.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.604
Maybe he spoke to somebody else?

17:43.687 --> 17:44.897
If it was broken,
they would speak to me,

17:44.980 --> 17:46.607
'cause I fix everything
in the building.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.443
Why would he tell me
he spoke to you when he didn't?

Junior.

Fucking Junior!

arrival time here.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.622
Why do you need arrival time?

18:01.705 --> 18:04.291
I can see appointment time,
but the arrival time,

18:04.374 --> 18:07.711
- that I don't get.
- Just standard policy.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.713
- Can I be honest with you?
- Sure.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.050
If my arrival time
was after my appointment time,

18:13.133 --> 18:15.677
I think I would lie
about the arrival time.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.012
Why would you lie?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.223
I don't know. I'd feel like
I'm not being a good patient.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.808
We just like to keep track
of things.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.644

an uncooperative patient I am.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.020

18:25.103 --> 18:27.815
Well, I'm saying hypothetically,
I could be,

18:27.898 --> 18:30.567
but you'd never know, because I
would lie about it anyway.

- Thank you so very much.
You're so welcome.

25:04.085 --> 25:05.670
Thank you.
- Hello, hello, hello!

25:05.754 --> 25:06.963
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.757
- You started already?
- Yeah.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.175
Oh, God, you couldn't wait?

25:10.258 --> 25:11.760
Now what kind of behavior
is that?

25:11.843 --> 25:13.220
Who wants to wait?
What's the point?

25:13.303 --> 25:16.139
What is this <i>meshugaas</i> I'm
hearing with you at the dentist?

25:16.223 --> 25:17.265
What the hell happened?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.351
By the way, you could've
warned me about the music.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.102
Jeff loves it.
- I tune it out.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.355
But listen, you gotta
talk to him for me,

25:23.438 --> 25:24.606
because I-- I need the--

25:24.689 --> 25:26.191
He's got the crown.
I need the crown.

25:26.274 --> 25:27.567
I'll work it.
Don't worry about it.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.735
- Thank you.
- I'll work it.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.570
Oh, you ran into Cheryl,
I heard.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.865
Yeah. What are you talking
about my towels to Cheryl for?

25:33.949 --> 25:35.367
Well, I thought Cheryl
would be interested.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.160
- Interested? Why? Who cares?
- In that the towels

25:37.244 --> 25:39.037
went downhill
since she lived with you.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.455
Stop gossiping about my towels.

25:40.538 --> 25:41.915
- They're none of your business.
- All right!

25:41.998 --> 25:44.209
And you know what?
I'm getting new towels now,

25:44.292 --> 25:45.418
and I'm gonna make them ratty,

25:45.502 --> 25:47.003
and in ten years,
you're gonna see

25:47.087 --> 25:49.005
- some great towels.
- You're getting new towels,

25:49.089 --> 25:50.298
you're gonna make them ratty,
how?

25:50.382 --> 25:51.716
You wash and you wash
and you wash,

25:51.800 --> 25:53.218
and then you hit 'em
against a rock,

25:53.301 --> 25:55.387
you hit 'em against the rock,
and then you age your towels,

25:55.470 --> 25:57.597
until I get it right,
but it takes years.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.307
You got a big rock
in your backyard?

25:59.391 --> 26:01.142
Yes, yes.
I have a rock in my backyard.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.519
And you use it for aging towels?

26:02.602 --> 26:03.645
Aging towels, yes.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.146
You know what,
if your towels weren't so ratty,

26:05.230 --> 26:06.606
I wouldn't have to talk
about them.

26:06.690 --> 26:07.899
You wanna talk about me? Fine.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.943
You wanna talk
about my relationships? Fine.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.987
Do not discuss my towels.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.282
So what's going on
with the casting and everything?

26:15.365 --> 26:16.908
- Everything good?
- Oh, yeah.

26:16.992 --> 26:20.287
We got to figure out what to do
about this Dylan O'Brien.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.372
We need to somehow apologize,

26:22.455 --> 26:24.124
but that's not gonna do
anything.

26:24.207 --> 26:26.167
- So maybe a gift.
- What kind of gift?

26:26.251 --> 26:28.670
- I don't know. I don't know.
- What does he like?

26:28.753 --> 26:30.005
I don't know what he likes.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.674
I know nothing except that
he likes dogs, which we know.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.050
Yeah, we know he likes dogs.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.136
He's just crazy
about dogs.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.513
Loves them.
He can't get enough of dogs.

26:40.473 --> 26:42.350
- How do you do?

26:42.434 --> 26:44.644
Who's such a good doggy?

26:44.728 --> 26:46.771
Who's such a good boy?

26:46.855 --> 26:49.274
- Who's a good boy?
- Larry?

26:51.067 --> 26:52.152
- Hey.
Hey.

26:52.235 --> 26:53.903
What are you doing at my place?

26:53.987 --> 26:57.365
Oh! Oh, this is the place
you were telling me about.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.327
- Yeah. Yeah. It's my restaurant.
- Oh, wow.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.536
What do you got--
Are you walking a dog?

27:01.619 --> 27:04.372
Oh, do I have a dog!
I sure do. Look at this guy.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.373
Oh, wow.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.791
You didn't mention
that you had a dog.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.460
No, I've had him
about two and a half years.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.879
He a rescue or you get him--
You didn't get him
from a breeder, right?

27:10.962 --> 27:12.339
- No. A literal rescue.
- Oh.

27:12.422 --> 27:15.717
Crazy story.
I'm walking down 26th Street,

27:15.800 --> 27:19.387
and I hear this whimper
coming from a dumpster.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.513
That's so fucked up.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.432
I go over there,
and I hear the whimper again.

27:22.515 --> 27:24.059
- It gets louder.
- He's scared.

27:24.142 --> 27:27.604
I dive into that dumpster.
It was disgusting.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.522
I had ravioli all over me.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.191
I sift through the garbage.

27:31.274 --> 27:34.527
I come out with this
amazing miracle.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.821
- Unbelievable.
- Took him home, gave him a bath.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.407
- He's my best friend.
We watch TV together.
- Yeah?

27:39.491 --> 27:42.702
He retrieves golf balls.
I hit 'em at the high school.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.245
- No way.
- I love this kid.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.332
Aren't they amazing?
Dogs save your life.

27:47.415 --> 27:50.335
Kiss, kiss, kiss.
Aw!

27:50.418 --> 27:54.923
Sorry. I can't. Dogs are just
my whole heart, so...

27:55.006 --> 27:56.633
- Why don't you join me?
- Really?

27:56.716 --> 27:57.926
Yeah. Bring that little guy
over here. Come on.

27:58.009 --> 28:01.221
Oh, I'd love to.
That would be great. Yeah.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.515
What's, uh... so, what's
your little guy's name?

28:03.598 --> 28:05.433
- What's up, little sweetie?
- Oh. Oh, uh, Dumpster.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.269
- Dumpster? Right.
'Cause you found him...
- Found him in a dumpster.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.437
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.023
- Oh, shut up. Shut up.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.233
You shouldn't
talk to him like that.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.402
No, no, no, no.
You got to be strict with these.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.904
Yeah. You gotta be strict.
Shut the fuck up, okay?

28:17.987 --> 28:19.906
Hey, by the way...

28:19.989 --> 28:21.866
I just wanna apologize again
for the other night.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.244
- The tissue thing.
- Uh, yeah. The tissue thing.

28:24.327 --> 28:25.912
Look. You know, I'm sorry, too.

28:25.995 --> 28:28.373
'Cause I can get a little testy.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.166
Yes, of course.
You're a sensitive artist. Yes.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.918
To be honest,
I reflected on that night,

28:32.001 --> 28:34.504
and I think I was feeling
a lot of insecurities, you know?

28:34.587 --> 28:36.423
- And I'm actually kind of glad
I ran into you...
- Yeah.

28:36.506 --> 28:37.799
-...because I'm seeing
a new side of you today, that--

28:37.882 --> 28:39.592
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.761
Oh, you want daddy?
What's that? You gotta poopie?

28:41.845 --> 28:43.763
You gotta do a poopie?
You know what?

28:43.847 --> 28:45.890
He's gotta go poopie!
- I think it's poopoo time.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.559
Listen, I'll be right back,

28:47.642 --> 28:49.769
and why don't we talk
a little more about <i>Young Larry?</i>

28:49.853 --> 28:51.896
Oh! Yeah!

28:51.980 --> 28:53.106
- Great.
- All right.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.399
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

28:56.609 --> 28:57.861
Ugh, shut up.

28:59.279 --> 29:00.864
Okay.
I can't wait.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.324
I am so excited.
I've never been here for lunch.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.909
I've heard so much
about this place.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.828
- Oh, it's expensive.
- No, don't worry about it.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.329
I'm gonna get it. Yeah.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.956
Okay.
- It's on me.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.458
Shut up.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.376
So, I'm gonna be taking
some time off.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.670
You are?
- Yes. Because I'm gonna go

29:15.753 --> 29:17.755
- on a 10-day retreat.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.507
Shh. Quiet. Quiet.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.343
Costa Rica? That's a little far.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.553
Read about a quarters.

29:23.636 --> 29:25.263
I'm gonna go into this,
like, four-star resort...

29:25.346 --> 29:27.056
- Don't bark! Shut up!

29:27.140 --> 29:28.308
Bad doggy. Bad dog.

29:29.767 --> 29:31.769
Hey! Hey!

29:32.312 --> 29:33.730
No. Don't--

29:33.813 --> 29:35.815
Hey! Angel Mu...

29:35.899 --> 29:38.610
Angel Muff... Dog!

29:38.693 --> 29:40.028
- Dog, dog!

29:43.031 --> 29:44.908
Hey, buddy! What the fuck?

29:44.991 --> 29:46.367
Why didn't you call
your dog's name?

29:47.285 --> 29:48.328
Couldn't say it.

29:48.411 --> 29:49.412
Wow.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.919
All right.

29:56.002 --> 30:00.298
Well, needless to say,
Dylan is out.

30:00.381 --> 30:02.008
Not doing the show.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.177
There's plenty of people.
We're gonna be fine.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.012
Just get another actor.
He's not the only actor.

30:06.095 --> 30:07.305
Well, we'll get
some names together

30:07.388 --> 30:09.057
- and see what we can do.
- There you go, there you go.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.767
Okay. Let's get going.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.393
- All right. Get going.
- Yep, yep, yep.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.687
- All right. We'll get going.
Come on. Come on.
Thank you.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.523
A little puppy
got grazed by a car.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.650
He's okay.
Not the end of the world.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.568
- We're going. Thank you.
- All right.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.362
Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.113
Oh, you know what?

30:26.074 --> 30:27.992
Forgot to mention.

30:28.076 --> 30:31.621
- I spoke to the maintenance guy.

30:31.704 --> 30:35.124
And he said that
you guys never spoke.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.377
I'm sorry. We're talking
about the toilet again?

30:37.460 --> 30:39.504
Yeah, because you said
that you spoke to him,

30:39.587 --> 30:43.174
and he said
that you never spoke.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.635
Hmm. Well, Larry,
I can assure you

30:45.718 --> 30:47.136
that I spoke
to the maintenance guy

30:47.220 --> 30:48.805
- about the toilet seat problem.
- Really?

30:48.888 --> 30:51.432
Why would he say that
you didn't?

30:51.516 --> 30:54.018
Larry?
Are you calling me a liar?

30:54.102 --> 30:55.937
I don't know.
Who am I supposed to believe?

30:56.020 --> 30:57.230
The maintenance guy?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.315
Or Don Jr.?

31:00.858 --> 31:03.361
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I think you know what it means.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.905
- No, I don't know
what that means, Larry!
- You know what Don Jr. means?

31:05.989 --> 31:07.240
You know what?
You should take your show

31:07.323 --> 31:08.491
and I think you should find
a better home for it.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.660
- With pleasure, Don Jr.
Fantastic.

31:10.743 --> 31:11.786
Good seeing you, Larry.

31:11.869 --> 31:13.329
- Goodbye, Don Jr.
Yeah. Thank you, Larry.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.664
- Thank you, Larry.
- Yeah, no, thank you.

31:14.747 --> 31:16.332
- Bye, Larry.
- See you, Don Jr.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.209
- Thank you, Larry.
- Okay, Don Jr.

31:18.293 --> 31:21.296
Mary Ferguson is gone,
Larry. And it's your fault!

31:21.379 --> 31:24.090
It's so hard to find fucking
Mary Fergusons, man.

31:24.173 --> 31:25.675
That's two Mary Fergusons
you've cost me.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.802
Mary Fergusons don't
fucking grow on trees, Larry!

31:27.885 --> 31:29.345
You think I'm happy?

31:29.429 --> 31:32.473
Okay. My show's over at Netflix
'cause I didn't wanna work
with a liar.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.768
And your precious Mary Ferguson
is bilking me for more money.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.687
- How?
- The dog needed hip surgery.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.022
Fine. I paid for that.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.982
Now she's saying
there are complications.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.443
You know what I think?
I think it's a scam!

31:43.526 --> 31:46.070
The same way that
that hygienist is scamming Jeff

31:46.154 --> 31:47.447
about the abortion.

31:47.530 --> 31:49.198
Let me tell you something, man.
Taking a dog to the fucking vet

31:49.282 --> 31:52.201
is like taking your fucking car
to the dealership.
They add shit on.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.746
Veterinary, uh, teeth cleanings,
all kinds of dumb shit.

31:54.829 --> 31:57.332
They clean the ass out,
all kinds of-- Cut the nails.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.458
Dogs get worms and shit.

31:58.541 --> 31:59.709
They gotta deworm
these motherfuckers.

31:59.792 --> 32:01.169
Take the worms
out these motherfuckers.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.755
Okay. I don't give a fuck.
I want you to talk to her, okay?

32:03.838 --> 32:06.341
I didn't yell the dog's name,
fine. But this is not fair.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.134
What the fuck is she gonna do?

32:08.217 --> 32:09.844
She over this shit.
You understand?

32:09.927 --> 32:11.262
I invested in that ass.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.348
And who the fuck's gonna go
on my trip now?

32:13.431 --> 32:15.850
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry
about that.

32:15.933 --> 32:18.353
But there is some good news.

32:19.687 --> 32:22.482
- Ta-da!
- Mm. Fuck.

32:22.565 --> 32:24.025
Oh, yeah. That's nice.

32:24.108 --> 32:26.069
- Oh, shit.
- That's a soft towel.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.570
I'm done with coarse towels.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.238
This is the way to go.
I was wrong.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.366
I'm looking forward
to my next shower.

32:31.449 --> 32:32.784
Yeah, fuck that.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.077
I'm taking this shit
to my fuckin' room.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.912
What? What are you talking
about? What are you doing?

32:35.995 --> 32:37.288
Fuck you mean,
"I'm talking about?"
- Hey, give me those towels.

32:37.372 --> 32:38.706
- What are you doing?
Fuck you, Larry.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.541
<i>Anyway, I'm so sorry
for what happened the other day.</i>

32:40.625 --> 32:44.545
That's really not a true
representation of who I am.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.214
- Really?
- Yes. Since that visit,

32:46.297 --> 32:48.716
I've been listening
to Greek music

32:48.800 --> 32:51.052
and it turns out, you know what?

32:51.135 --> 32:52.387
I really like it.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.888
- It's so fun.
- Are you kidding me?

32:58.351 --> 32:59.852
All right. Okay.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.437
- Don't hurt yourself.
- I love it. I love it.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.314
I knew you would like
Greek music.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.191
You were so right,
Dr. Thanapapalous.

33:05.274 --> 33:07.860
You know, my father always said
it takes a great man

33:07.944 --> 33:09.779
to be able to recognize
that he was wrong,

33:09.862 --> 33:11.739
and I accept your apology.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.325
I guess you're saying
I'm a great man.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.368
Okay. You know what?

33:15.451 --> 33:17.036
Your permanent crown
is waiting for you.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.497
I'm gonna go get it
and we'll take care of you.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.332
Thank you, Dr. Thanapapalous.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.709
You, too, are a great man.

Okay, Mr. David.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.600
How you doing?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.270
- Uh-huh.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.156
You know, they crash plates

Oh, you're really getting into
it, huh? I love it.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.749
- Excuse me, Dr. Thanapapalous.
- Yeah. Uh-huh?

34:02.832 --> 34:04.751
The urinal is still broken
in the men's room,

34:04.834 --> 34:06.127
and people are complaining.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.087
- Julio didn't fix it?
- No.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.256
I talked to him twice this week.

34:10.339 --> 34:13.092
- Okay, okay. I'll call him.
Thank you.
- Okay.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.720
That son of a bitch janitor.

34:15.803 --> 34:19.265
This Julio, he promised me,
he looked me in the face

34:19.348 --> 34:21.976
and he said he was gonna fix
the urinal, and he didn't.

34:22.059 --> 34:23.895
- He's a fucking liar.
- Uh-huh.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.354
I asked him twice.

34:28.441 --> 34:30.151
- Ah!
- I think he drinks.

34:30.234 --> 34:33.070
- Yeah.
- You never lie to a Greek.

34:33.154 --> 34:36.866
- Especially the Greek mafia.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.159
- I'm just kidding.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.285
Just kidding.

Here you go, Doctor.

Oh, <i>efcharisto,</i> Angie.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.335
Oh, do you need anything else
right now?

34:47.418 --> 34:49.879
No. No, no. I'm good.
Thank you.

34:51.756 --> 34:55.051
Poor thing.
She's really down.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.886
Uh-huh?

34:56.969 --> 34:59.722
- She had an abortion last week.
- Good.

She didn't miss one day of work.
