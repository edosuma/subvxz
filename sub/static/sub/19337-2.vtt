08:29.776 --> 08:31.076
I don't believe there's
a traitor among them.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.744
The only people who knew about

08:32.746 --> 08:34.079
our attempts to supply Canonbie

08:34.081 --> 08:37.282
were those generals,
myself and you.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.684
And yet England has
thwarted us every time.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.587
Through luck or skill,
I don't know.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.989
But I trust those men.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.758
They are loyal both
to Scotland and to you.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.293
And what about their servants?

08:48.295 --> 08:51.129
Or their wives?

08:51.131 --> 08:53.231
You tend
to underestimate women, James.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.799
Like you underestimated me.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.636
I made a mistake.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.070
I failed to tell you

08:59.072 --> 09:00.939
about Knox's involvement
in Lola's death

09:00.941 --> 09:03.108
because I didn't trust
your leadership,

09:03.110 --> 09:04.676
and I was wrong.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.244
Now I don't know who to trust.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.714
You had your own agenda when
you rescued me from Clan Gordon.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.117
And you forced
my hand against them,

09:12.119 --> 09:14.185
making me an enemy of
the Catholics and John Knox.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.588
Now I have no choice
to serve anyone but you.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.990
Which brings me to ask you this,
James, can I trust you?

09:18.992 --> 09:20.926
Canonbie isn't Clan Gordon.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.727
It's not a Catholic
or Protestant issue.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.262
This is about Scotland.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.698
None of us wants that village
falling to England.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.134
Well, someone does,
and they're close to me.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.670
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

09:31.672 --> 09:34.739
to have a whole village's
lives in your hands,

09:34.741 --> 09:36.107
and not know who I can trust?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.742
Not even my own brother?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.578
Mary...
Stop.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.212
There is nothing
you can say.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.616
Your actions have
spoken for you.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.284
And if I am going to be alone,

09:46.286 --> 09:48.219
then I will
save Canonbie myself.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.731
ELIZABETH:
<i> Reverend Knox,</i>
<i> thank you so much for coming.</i>

09:59.733 --> 10:00.932
I was honored...

10:00.934 --> 10:03.068
and surprised by your request.

10:04.237 --> 10:08.106
Please excuse
the heightened security.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.175
You may not
have heard,

10:10.177 --> 10:12.243
but there was recently
an attack on my life

10:12.245 --> 10:14.846
at my own castle,
and I think

10:14.848 --> 10:17.148
you can guess
who was responsible.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.086
Mary, Queen of Scots.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.721
Huh.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.123
Well, what can you expect
from a Catholic?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.057
And a woman.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.994
It was Eve who damned us all.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.062
If it's my preaching
on women's roles

10:31.064 --> 10:32.397
you wish to discuss...

10:32.399 --> 10:34.399
Actually, no.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.800
But I would like to talk

10:35.802 --> 10:37.002
about joining forces
against Mary.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.670
Mary's return
to Scotland is

10:38.672 --> 10:40.071
inconvenient for both of us.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.674
Despite our differences,
there must be a way

10:42.676 --> 10:44.843
we can work together
on her removal.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.811
Mary has managed to turn
many of the nobles

10:46.813 --> 10:49.214
who formerly opposed her.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.715
But they could
be turned back.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.684
For a price, I imagine.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.285
Their loyalty
does not come cheaply.

10:54.287 --> 10:57.122
Give me a day
to gather the funds.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.959
Until then, I hope you will stay
here at court as my guest.

11:05.332 --> 11:09.167
Despite our differences,
perhaps this is the beginning

11:09.169 --> 11:12.804
of a mutually
beneficial alliance.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.173
I could not look forward
to anything more.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.713
<i> I had forgotten</i>
<i> how much I missed</i>

11:21.715 --> 11:23.214
silk brocade.

11:23.216 --> 11:26.451
And don't get me wrong,
Scottish wool is very warm...

11:26.453 --> 11:28.920
But French clothes
are so beautiful.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.955
It's not disloyal to Scotland
to admire them.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.191
Catherine sent me
these weeks ago,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.060
just haven't had
time to unpack.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.195
A St. Brigid's Day party
is the perfect excuse.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.197
The tradition of
blessing new garments,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.099
give the ladies of the
court a chance to see

11:41.101 --> 11:43.001
the latest in
French fashion.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.336
And you think the information

11:45.338 --> 11:46.871
being leaked is
coming through one

11:46.873 --> 11:48.139
of the generals' wives?

11:48.141 --> 11:50.475
It's the next logical
place to look.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.377
I want to believe James
when he says that my generals

11:52.379 --> 11:53.878
are loyal to me,

11:53.880 --> 11:56.815
but men forget
that women have ears.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.283
Yes, well, it wouldn't be
the first part

11:58.285 --> 12:00.285
of the female anatomy
that comes to a man's mind.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.820
(chuckles)
So...

12:01.822 --> 12:03.254
how can I help?

12:03.256 --> 12:05.056
The dresses are
just the draw.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.359
I need you to make sure that
the party is... relaxed.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.394
And once everyone,

12:09.396 --> 12:10.395
including the generals' wives,

12:10.397 --> 12:12.097
have let down their guard,

12:12.099 --> 12:14.299
I will drop a bit
of information in confidence.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.468
If that information leaks,
it will reveal

12:16.470 --> 12:18.169
who the traitors are
in my court.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.504
It's an excellent plan.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.406
Oh, I've missed this.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.407
What, spying?

12:22.409 --> 12:23.842
Saving Scottish villages?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.343
Spending time with you...

12:25.345 --> 12:26.778
and having a party,

12:26.780 --> 12:28.747
even if the purpose
is political.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.515
I've missed you, too.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.984
Since I've arrived
in Scotland, I've felt

12:32.986 --> 12:35.754
very alone
with no one to turn to.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.490
In fact, I was hoping to make
your visit more permanent.

12:38.492 --> 12:39.791
How?

12:39.793 --> 12:41.025
I had to respond officially

12:41.027 --> 12:43.094
to Lola's involvement

12:43.096 --> 12:45.196
in the assassination attempt
against Elizabeth.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.031
I had no choice
but to confiscate

12:47.033 --> 12:48.133
her family's lands.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.834
But Lola was tricked

12:49.836 --> 12:51.236
and her family have
already suffered enough.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.270
I know, and I
want to be sure

12:52.272 --> 12:53.404
they're taken care of,

12:53.406 --> 12:55.340
which is why I am asking you

12:55.342 --> 12:57.275
and Castleroy to move here

12:57.277 --> 12:59.043
and manage their
lands for them.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.945
You could set up
residence at court,

13:00.947 --> 13:01.946
at least for part
of the time,

13:01.948 --> 13:03.148
and be my lady again.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.283
Mary, I...

13:05.285 --> 13:06.851
don't know what to say.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.186
I understand if you need
some time to think.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.990
There is much to miss in France.

13:11.992 --> 13:15.160
But I do hope you say yes,
Greer.

13:15.162 --> 13:18.129
Honestly, I need someone here
I can trust.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.567
Well, this is a very generous
proposal and a chance

13:22.569 --> 13:25.036
to regain my best friend.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.471
I shall write
to Castleroy immediately

13:26.473 --> 13:28.173
and tell him of your kind offer.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.241
(sighs)

13:33.947 --> 13:36.147
Ah, Charles, if I
could have a moment.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.549
Not now, I need some air.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.584
Well, you can breathe
while I talk.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.420
There are urgent matters
that require your attention.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.022
Again?
I'm sick of people

13:44.024 --> 13:45.523
asking things of me.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.592
You are the king,

13:47.594 --> 13:48.827
that is the job.

13:48.829 --> 13:49.828
Queen Elizabeth will

13:49.830 --> 13:51.329
release Narcisse,

13:51.331 --> 13:53.431
but she is demanding
compensation for his return,

13:53.433 --> 13:55.333
so if you could please
sign these documents,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.435
we can get
our lord chancellor back.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.469
I'll look at it later.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.938
At least think of your nephew,

13:59.940 --> 14:01.239
young John.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.008
He's also trapped in England,
surrounded

14:04.010 --> 14:05.910
by strangers instead
of home with his family.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.312
Lucky him.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.847
Charles, wait.
(grunts)

14:11.384 --> 14:12.517
What has happened to your arm?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.985
It's fine.
I fell.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.604
It's a minor injury.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.222
Please let me
look at it.
I said it's fine.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.924
I haven't been
sleeping well.
Well, then
bring Narcisse home

14:19.926 --> 14:22.060
and let someone else
take the burden.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.965
Your absences are starting
to be cause for concern,

14:26.967 --> 14:28.533
particularly with your sister,
Leeza.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.468
At least dine
with your family.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.071
Show her you are present
and capable of ruling

14:33.073 --> 14:34.939
this country
without Spain's help.

14:34.941 --> 14:37.408
If I say I'll come to lunch,
will you stop talking?

14:37.410 --> 14:38.543
Yes.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.979
And perhaps
you will sign

14:40.981 --> 14:43.381
these documents later?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.052
Lord Narcisse.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.254
The queen requests

14:49.256 --> 14:50.321
your presence.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.556
Please, tell me
that France

14:51.558 --> 14:53.958
has finally
negotiated my release.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.926
Sorry, no.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.327
But perhaps you can

14:56.329 --> 14:57.962
earn your own way home.
The man responsible

14:57.964 --> 14:59.631
for your wife's death is here.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.332
Elizabeth has a favor to ask.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.938
So, are you killing Knox,
or am I?

15:06.940 --> 15:09.941
Knox cannot be harmed
while he's here in England.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.175
Me, then.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.279
Let me be clear,

15:14.281 --> 15:15.647
Lord Narcisse.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.148
I do not want you

15:17.150 --> 15:18.383
to assassinate John Knox,

15:18.385 --> 15:19.550
not until I get

15:19.552 --> 15:21.085
what I want.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.288
Which is?
Proof of who my enemies are.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.257
You know that Knox forged
the letter from Mary.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.358
He threatened

15:27.360 --> 15:30.228
your life and he cost Lola hers!

15:30.230 --> 15:34.432
Yes, but the nanny, who was
my only witness, is dead.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.134
I have no proof
of that crime,

15:36.136 --> 15:38.303
so I need Knox to plot another.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.039
And you want me
to help him do that?

15:41.041 --> 15:42.507
Gain Knox's trust.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.710
He hates me because
I am a woman with a throne.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.545
While he's in England,
he's probably already

15:47.547 --> 15:49.580
planning a meeting with
my enemies, and if not,

15:49.582 --> 15:51.549
you can suggest it.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.184
Catching Knox in the act,

15:53.186 --> 15:55.420
plotting against me,
will give me the evidence

15:55.422 --> 15:56.988
I need to bring him down.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.389
You want me
to entrap him.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.590
And what's in it for me?

15:59.592 --> 16:01.192
Your freedom.
Worthless

16:01.194 --> 16:02.193
without justice.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.594
Do you honestly
expect me to be

16:03.596 --> 16:05.330
so close to Knox
and not kill him?

16:05.332 --> 16:08.199
You are not the only one
who cared for Lola,

16:08.201 --> 16:10.068
or wants Knox dead.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.471
Do what I ask, and once I have
the evidence I need...

16:13.473 --> 16:15.006
you can have Knox.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.748
(indistinct conversation)

16:25.151 --> 16:27.485
The four generals'
wives have arrived

16:27.487 --> 16:29.620
and the wine is flowing.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.456
Well done.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.492
I've arranged for James
to interrupt me

16:34.494 --> 16:35.660
with an "urgent" message

16:35.662 --> 16:36.761
after I get the four
of them together.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.162
Which ones are they?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.364
GREER:
Lady Calum and Lady Innes

16:39.366 --> 16:40.631
are partaking of the pheasant.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.300
And standing at the foot
of the stairs,

16:42.302 --> 16:44.569
talking to Emily Knox,
are Lady Donal and Lady McEwan.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.270
Emily Knox?

16:46.272 --> 16:47.572
I didn't know Knox
had a daughter.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.107
GREER:
He doesn't.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.108
That's his wife.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.110
Oh, she seems...

16:52.112 --> 16:54.245
Young.
Yes.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.313
Well,

16:55.315 --> 16:56.581
we'd best begin.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.650
Ladies!

16:59.652 --> 17:01.185
Welcome to
my St. Brigid's Day luncheon,

17:01.187 --> 17:04.288
a time to celebrate spring,
sisterhood,

17:04.290 --> 17:06.024
and a chance for me
to get to know

17:06.026 --> 17:07.258
all of you better.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.093
In France,
we celebrate this day

17:09.095 --> 17:10.294
with beautiful things.

17:10.296 --> 17:13.264
So, in honor of St. Brigid,

17:13.266 --> 17:15.767
let us raise a glass
to the patron saint

17:15.769 --> 17:17.402
of fertility.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.636
WOMAN:
Your Majesty.
WOMAN 2:
To St. Brigid.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.273
(women gasp)

17:29.582 --> 17:31.649
(indistinct conversation)

17:36.689 --> 17:39.190
He gambled
the family fortune away

17:39.192 --> 17:40.825
in three short years.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.593
The daughter will have no
dowry left at this rate,

17:42.595 --> 17:44.629
and she won't be married
for her looks,

17:44.631 --> 17:46.130
that much is certain.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.398
And his brother, well...

17:47.400 --> 17:50.268
Queen Mary,
there you are.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.335
James has arrived.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.336
Oh.

17:52.338 --> 17:53.538
Have you seen Lady Calum's

17:53.540 --> 17:54.505
new cosmetic cream?

17:54.507 --> 17:55.907
We all have.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.308
It makes your
complexion flawless,

17:57.310 --> 17:58.643
Lady Calum.
The secret

17:58.645 --> 18:00.244
is in the arsenic.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.479
Or is it the lead?

18:01.481 --> 18:02.613
I forget.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.348
Both are so good for one's skin.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.550
Mm.
(James clears throat)

18:05.552 --> 18:06.584
Forgive me
for interrupting,

18:06.586 --> 18:07.852
Queen Mary,

18:07.854 --> 18:09.454
but I have a rather
urgent message.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.289
Oh, what is it?

18:15.228 --> 18:16.427
That is good news.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.663
Thank you, James.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.233
What is it?
What's happened?

18:22.235 --> 18:24.802
Can you ladies keep a secret?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.338
The next time the English

18:27.340 --> 18:29.574
intercept a certain shipment,

18:29.576 --> 18:33.478
they will get a surprise
in the form of poisoned grain.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.246
Oh.
(gasps)

18:35.248 --> 18:37.315
To Scotland.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.883
WOMAN:
Really is a
wonderful breeze.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.518
WOMAN 2:
Try it on.
Oh, no!

18:40.520 --> 18:41.786
MARY:
Oh, dear.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.655
LADY CALUM:
Poor Mrs. Knox,

18:44.657 --> 18:46.491
she is straight
off the farm.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.726
MARY:
I'd feel sorry for her if she
wasn't married to John Knox.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.862
Feel sorry for her
because she's his wife.

18:50.864 --> 18:53.764
Really? It isn't
a happy marriage?

18:53.766 --> 18:55.366
How could it be?

18:55.368 --> 18:57.535
Alone in that house
with Knox off preaching

18:57.537 --> 18:58.503
all the time.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.238
She must be very lonely.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.639
I hear she drinks
to excess.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.308
I haven't seen Mrs. Knox
touch a drop all day.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.676
Well, you don't think a
reverend's wife would dare

19:05.678 --> 19:07.645
drink openly, do you?

19:07.647 --> 19:08.846
But the servants say otherwise.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.548
Oh, that's interesting.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.916
Sad is more like it.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.618
Yes, of course.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.319
Speaking of which,
I think I've had

19:15.321 --> 19:16.787
a bit too much to drink myself.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.356
If you ladies
will excuse me?
Your Majesty.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.591
I also hear

19:20.593 --> 19:22.693
he makes her have "relations"

19:22.695 --> 19:24.395
through a hole in the sheet.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.463
(gasp, laughing)

19:25.465 --> 19:27.198
That's speculation,
of course.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.566
Then why repeat it?

19:42.248 --> 19:44.248
For God's sake, we
might as well eat,

19:44.250 --> 19:45.883
the king is clearly
not on his way.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.251
Perhaps something came up.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.620
Like ruling a nation?
Mother, please.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.456
Charles is shirking every
responsibility imaginable.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.724
He can't even be bothered

19:53.726 --> 19:55.826
to find a proper husband
for poor Claude.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.461
I'm still in mourning.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.297
We know, Claude.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.432
And frankly, it's embarrassing.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.767
I'm embarrassing?!

20:02.769 --> 20:04.502
Uh-huh.
That's right.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.536
In this family,

20:05.538 --> 20:07.371
nobody actually has feelings.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.509
Another empty chair.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.377
But perhaps that's best.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.480
It gives us a chance to talk
about the lord chancellorship.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.849
I've received word
from my husband, King Philip.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.418
I'm aware who you married,
Leeza.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.486
You don't have
to keep saying it.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.655
Spain will pay
for Narcisse's release.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.257
Really?
Of course.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.558
We want him out of England
as much as you do.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.994
But only if he steps down

20:29.996 --> 20:31.829
as lord chancellor permanently.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.699
And I assume you have
a replacement in mind.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.401
Yes. Cardinal Juan Rosales.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.903
Ah. A Spaniard.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.871
A true and
loyal Catholic.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.573
A fine man,
I'm sure,

20:42.575 --> 20:45.376
but he would need to be approved
by the privy council.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.711
Well, luckily,
he's on his way as we speak.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.713
Then he will have made
the trip for nothing,

20:48.715 --> 20:50.948
because I will never
allow a Spaniard

20:50.950 --> 20:52.550
to gain a foothold
in the French government.

20:52.552 --> 20:53.851
You have no authority

20:53.853 --> 20:54.919
over the French government.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.387
Neither do you.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.822
You're not in charge here,
Leeza.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.657
No one is in charge here!

20:59.659 --> 21:01.359
So now I am
forced to come in

21:01.361 --> 21:02.660
and clean up your mess.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.862
Do not touch my mess!

21:04.864 --> 21:06.764
I may not be
queen or regent,

21:06.766 --> 21:08.699
but I still have influence,

21:08.701 --> 21:10.635
and I will get
my lord chancellor back

21:10.637 --> 21:12.536
without the help of Spain.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.923
NARCISSE:
The finest Venetian glass,

21:32.925 --> 21:34.525
and what do
the English put in it?

21:34.527 --> 21:36.594
Riesling.

21:36.596 --> 21:40.898
I would kill for a good
French red right now.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.933
You're in
the wrong country, then.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.535
But not by choice.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.937
I'm sorry, we haven't
been introduced.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.407
I'm Lord Narcisse,
Queen Elizabeth's

21:49.409 --> 21:51.742
special guest.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.612
I stabbed two of her guards
at my wife's beheading.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.080
So, you're the Frenchman
whose wife

21:56.082 --> 21:58.082
tried to assassinate the queen.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.017
A failure that many regret.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.819
I know that I do.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.888
(chuckles)
Dangerous talk.

22:03.890 --> 22:07.425
Which is why I made
sure that we are alone.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.995
Elizabeth murdered my wife.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.098
I have cause for vengeance
and nothing to lose.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.733
But you, Reverend Knox,

22:15.735 --> 22:17.335
if you use your time
here at court well,

22:17.337 --> 22:19.970
I believe that you have
everything to gain.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.105
So you know who I am.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.708
And you think
you know why I'm here.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.109
Well, I assume that you
and Elizabeth are conspiring

22:25.111 --> 22:27.978
against Mary, a mission
I heartily approve of.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.481
Loyalty to Mary
cost my wife her life.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.450
But once Mary is gone,

22:32.452 --> 22:35.119
then Elizabeth will
reign over both countries,

22:35.121 --> 22:37.855
and I do not care
for that at all.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.492
Well, neither do I, frankly.

22:41.494 --> 22:44.061
Then why not
make use of this time?

22:44.063 --> 22:45.996
Elizabeth's inner circle
must have

22:45.998 --> 22:49.033
a few malcontents
waiting for leadership.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.001
Of course, you would need
a safe place to meet

22:51.003 --> 22:54.071
away from prying eyes
and English ears.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.940
And I suppose you have
such a place in mind.

22:55.942 --> 22:56.941
The French embassy.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.542
Technically, it's French soil.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.412
You and your supporters
would be virtually untouchable.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.613
Lord Narcisse?

23:02.615 --> 23:05.116
What you propose

23:05.118 --> 23:07.785
is a dangerous act
of sedition,

23:07.787 --> 23:10.688
and we should not
speak of it further.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.760
Tempting though it may be.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.965
MARY:
James?

23:20.967 --> 23:22.400
I need to speak to you.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.618
I've already assigned guards

23:23.619 --> 23:24.835
to watch the homes
of each of the generals.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.070
If any of their wives

23:26.072 --> 23:27.505
attempt to contact England,

23:27.507 --> 23:29.140
we'll know soon enough.

23:29.142 --> 23:30.174
Good, but there's
something else.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.109
I need you
to befriend Emily Knox.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.512
Emily Knox? Why?

23:34.514 --> 23:37.548
I hear that it's an unhappy
marriage and that she's lonely.

23:37.550 --> 23:41.185
You don't seriously expect me
to seduce John Knox's wife?

23:41.187 --> 23:42.420
Well, she is in his house.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.654
She may have knowledge
of his doings.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.089
At the least,
she has access

23:45.091 --> 23:48.092
to his documents and may
provide a valuable resource.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.628
Do you not understand how
dangerous this could be?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.563
Not just for me,
but for her, as well.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.465
Knox cost Lola her life.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.700
And he is after mine.

23:56.702 --> 23:59.170
He is out of town,
possibly plotting against me,

23:59.172 --> 24:00.638
which means
you need to act now.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.174
I am not your whore.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.809
Oh, but you're
Knox's butcher?

24:04.811 --> 24:07.445
You were going to take action
against Clan Gordon for him.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.579
Why not take
this action for me?

24:08.581 --> 24:10.781
I'm giving you a chance
to earn my trust.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.717
You speak of me earning
your trust, but what of you?

24:13.719 --> 24:15.686
You give orders,
you use people.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.521
Whatever I do,
it's never enough.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.557
Because no matter
how many times I prove

24:19.559 --> 24:21.225
to you my ability
as a ruler,

24:21.227 --> 24:23.961
you still refuse to give me
your loyalty willingly.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.964
I am alone to defend myself and
Scotland against all enemies.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.667
But in an effort to
take down your enemies,

24:29.669 --> 24:32.803
you run the risk of losing
those you truly need.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.674
Trust is given, but
loyalty is earned.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.742
And you, my queen,

24:38.744 --> 24:41.779
have not earned mine.

24:50.523 --> 24:51.755
I'll be leaving
within the hour for a meeting

24:51.757 --> 24:54.225
at the French embassy.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.861
Have my carriage ready.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.569
(baby cooing)

25:09.075 --> 25:10.207
Look who's still awake.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.042
Sorry if we
disturbed you, sir.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.678
Poor boy has trouble
falling asleep.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.214
Well, I expect
he misses his mother.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.983
It's, uh,
it's John,

25:18.985 --> 25:21.118
isn't it?
Lady Lola's son.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.820
I'm a friend of the family.
Then you know if ever

25:22.822 --> 25:25.089
a soul had a reason for unrest,
it's this child.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.024
He's lost much for one so young.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.959
His father, mother...

25:28.961 --> 25:30.694
And his last caregiver.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.664
I hear she ran off
and abandoned the child.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.733
Oh, no, sir.
She died, sir.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.935
They found her with the boy
and brought them back to court.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.304
But an infection
took her strangely quick.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.840
Poor thing, no wonder
he can't sleep.

25:42.842 --> 25:43.841
Also, I think
he's getting a...

25:43.843 --> 25:46.277
Excuse me.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.916
Do I only give orders
and use people?

25:51.918 --> 25:53.717
Mary, no,
not as a friend.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.119
But as a queen.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.187
It's what queens do.
You can't help that.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.956
I suppose this
is why queens

25:58.958 --> 26:02.693
find it so hard
to trust people.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.261
Why are you packing?

26:04.263 --> 26:06.230
I thought maybe I should.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.731
I'm not sure
if I can accept your offer

26:07.733 --> 26:08.866
to stay here at court.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.000
Why not?
Has Castleroy refused?

26:10.002 --> 26:11.201
No.
No, not at all.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.836
It's just...

26:12.838 --> 26:14.071
something's been bothering me

26:14.073 --> 26:15.940
since the St. Brigid's Day
party.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.142
All that gossip about
the unfortunate Mrs. Knox.

26:18.144 --> 26:21.211
Those vultures were laughing
at the poor girl...

26:21.213 --> 26:23.147
And I only seemed
to fuel the fire.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.718
Greer, of all the threats
that I have faced

26:27.720 --> 26:28.953
since I came
to Scotland,

26:28.955 --> 26:30.955
John Knox is the
most dangerous.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.023
And those women,
their gossip gave me

26:33.025 --> 26:35.159
information that
I can use against him.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.028
I understand.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.896
That is your life,
and the life here at court.

26:38.898 --> 26:41.298
But I'm not sure it can be mine.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.967
Not with Castleroy and Rose.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.635
If you're afraid
of people finding out

26:44.637 --> 26:47.137
that Castleroy isn't her father,
no one needs to know.

26:47.139 --> 26:50.040
Not a secret we can keep.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.376
The truth is the baby is even

26:52.378 --> 26:54.778
darker in complexion
than her father.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.647
Oh, I see.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.315
In France, we've had
to pretend that Rose

26:58.317 --> 27:01.118
is an orphan we've taken in.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.787
And when I think of my
child here at court...

27:03.789 --> 27:04.922
People can be awful.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.690
Greer, I'm so sorry.

27:06.692 --> 27:09.693
How can I be your lady
when even the servants

27:09.695 --> 27:11.862
in the royal nursery
would refuse to care for her?

27:11.864 --> 27:13.998
Even a queen cannot
change how people are.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.866
Mary, I would
love to stay,

27:15.868 --> 27:18.068
but this is my family.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.137
And your loyalty must lie
with your family.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.673
If you must go,
I understand.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.074
But if you stay,

27:24.076 --> 27:26.810
you'll be provided
with the best care.

27:26.812 --> 27:30.714
And you and your family
will be welcome in my court.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.282
As a queen

27:32.284 --> 27:34.985
and as your friend,
this I can guarantee.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.087
Thank you.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.355
I'd love to stay.

27:39.692 --> 27:41.825
We enter the embassy
through the catacombs.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.395
Have a man posted on the street
in case Knox runs.

27:44.397 --> 27:45.429
He already has.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.097
Knox is gone.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.099
I received word
from my contact at the embassy

27:49.101 --> 27:50.401
Knox never showed, and he's not

27:50.403 --> 27:52.136
at the castle, either.
What?

27:52.138 --> 27:53.571
He may have sensed a trap.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.005
He was seen entering the
infirmary an hour ago

27:55.007 --> 27:57.775
asking questions about
the death of John's nanny.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.376
Then he knows the nanny
was never in the infirmary.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.978
Yeah.
He must suspect
that we hid the truth

28:00.980 --> 28:03.714
that she was killed by the
queen's guard, but if he thinks

28:03.716 --> 28:05.416
she told us about
his association

28:05.418 --> 28:08.686
with the assassination attempt,
he'll flee.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.254
You, go after Knox.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.422
You two come with me.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.724
The French embassy
is this way.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.132
(indistinct chatter)

28:28.941 --> 28:30.841
Dear God.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.177
We're going to need more men.

28:33.179 --> 28:36.447
50 of my own subjects
gathered against me?

28:36.449 --> 28:38.015
(chuckles)

28:38.017 --> 28:39.983
I imagined he could
summon a handful

28:39.985 --> 28:41.819
of disloyal men, but 50?

28:41.821 --> 28:43.320
Unfortunately,

28:43.322 --> 28:44.905
Knox is not amongst them.

28:44.906 --> 28:46.489
We stopped him
before he reached the border.

28:46.492 --> 28:49.193
He's been detained, but we
have no evidence against him.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.095
Then we have nothing.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.197
We have witnesses who are
willing to testify that

28:53.199 --> 28:55.866
the men we've arrested were
conspiring against you.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.801
Those men, at least,
will be tried for treason.

28:57.803 --> 28:59.903
I cannot bring them
to trial.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.106
Not all 50 of them.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.141
They are English nobles,
your own subjects.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.777
What would you
have me do?

29:06.779 --> 29:10.047
Let their hatred of me
be heard in a court of law?

29:10.049 --> 29:14.151
Parade their treason
through the streets, so that

29:14.153 --> 29:17.488
the vast number of them can
inspire others to do the same?

29:17.490 --> 29:18.889
Your Majesty...

29:18.891 --> 29:20.991
We must kill them.

29:23.796 --> 29:26.296
Kill them all.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.939
Mother, is that what you're
wearing to afternoon mass?

29:35.941 --> 29:37.975
(scoffs) I'm not going
to afternoon mass.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.344
Not today or ever again.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.479
Leeza can take
her false humility

29:42.481 --> 29:45.048
and Spanish aggression,
and she can choke on it.

29:45.050 --> 29:47.084
I'm getting Narcisse back today.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.819
Your sister may have
the power of Spain

29:48.821 --> 29:50.521
and the church, but
I still have friends.

29:50.523 --> 29:53.257
I have invited the
nobles to a banquet

29:53.259 --> 29:55.793
where I will remind them of
the liberal extravagance

29:55.795 --> 29:58.095
of the Valois, and
what they stand to lose

29:58.097 --> 29:59.496
if Leeza and Spain take over.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.533
They will be begging
for Narcisse's return,

30:02.535 --> 30:07.304
a French lord chancellor,
not a puppet of Spain.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.094
Queen Mother,

30:31.096 --> 30:32.863
you're looking well.
Am I,

30:32.865 --> 30:34.364
Lord Dennard?
I thought I might be

30:34.366 --> 30:36.400
pale at the shock of betrayal.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.868
Where is everyone?

30:37.870 --> 30:39.570
Of the ten nobles
I've invited,

30:39.572 --> 30:41.572
only you have deigned to appear.

30:41.574 --> 30:44.408
Well, I believe many
had a change in schedule

30:44.410 --> 30:47.177
considering the crops,

30:47.179 --> 30:49.513
and, uh, holidays upon us.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.181
You mean the nobles

30:51.183 --> 30:53.417
discussed it and determined

30:53.419 --> 30:56.053
that Spain is strong
while the Valois seem weak.

30:56.055 --> 31:00.924
Everyone but you
has deserted me.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.595
And you just came
for the food.

31:04.597 --> 31:06.597
And your charming company.

31:06.599 --> 31:07.965
Get out!

31:21.013 --> 31:23.881
You left rather quickly
in the night.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.215
Was it something I said?

31:25.217 --> 31:26.516
When I found a nanny
at your court

31:26.518 --> 31:28.218
died suddenly of infection,

31:28.220 --> 31:31.488
without the infirmary having
any record of her illness,

31:31.490 --> 31:33.290
I decided to return home.

31:33.292 --> 31:36.193
Suddenly, I felt... unsafe.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.195
Oh, I imagine you did.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.963
Especially when
you found out

31:39.965 --> 31:43.100
the nanny did not die
of a mysterious infection.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.036
She was killed
moments after confessing

31:46.038 --> 31:47.938
you were the one who organized

31:47.940 --> 31:49.339
the assassination attempt
on my life.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.675
How troubling.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.577
And yet you seem so untroubled.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.145
People say things,

31:55.147 --> 31:57.281
but without proof,
they're just words.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.416
That's why you tried to catch me
in the act of sedition.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.151
You have no proof against me.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.653
Otherwise, I'd be
in the Tower right now.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.521
The Tower is too good for you.

32:04.523 --> 32:07.157
I'll be handing you
to Lord Narcisse, instead.

32:07.159 --> 32:10.093
No, you're not.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.462
Your rule is tenuous,
it always has been.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.331
Despite your years
on the throne,

32:14.333 --> 32:16.099
50 of your Protestant subjects

32:16.101 --> 32:17.601
gathered against you
just last night.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.337
And yet none of them
have been heard from since.

32:20.339 --> 32:21.638
Because you killed them.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.073
See, you think
that's a show of power,

32:23.075 --> 32:24.441
but we both
know the truth.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.710
You're afraid.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.645
That's why you did it quietly,
hoping no one would know.

32:28.647 --> 32:32.115
But the rumors are already
starting to spread.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.185
Now, if you give me to Lord
Narcisse and I go missing...

32:35.187 --> 32:37.521
those 50 will be
replaced by 100,

32:37.523 --> 32:39.656
those 100 will
raise 1,000 more.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.658
Soon you'll have an uprising
on your hands.

32:41.660 --> 32:45.462
You think your life
is worth that much?

32:45.464 --> 32:47.331
(chuckles)

32:47.333 --> 32:48.665
You're just a man.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.635
And you are a woman
of questionable birth

32:51.637 --> 32:54.338
that no one really wants
on the throne.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.140
Even Mary. Returned,
as queen of Scotland,

32:57.142 --> 33:00.610
she's a greater threat than
ever, yet... you do nothing.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.612
Why not send
assassins?

33:02.614 --> 33:05.148
Because you know that
killing another queen

33:05.150 --> 33:07.417
only opens the door
to someone killing you.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.454
Someone like you?

33:10.456 --> 33:14.057
You tried to have me killed
and you failed.

33:14.059 --> 33:16.493
So take your
anti-monarchist

33:16.495 --> 33:18.362
poison back to Scotland

33:18.364 --> 33:20.430
and direct it towards Mary...

33:23.569 --> 33:25.569
...where it might actually
do me some good.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.011
GREER:
Mary?

33:35.581 --> 33:37.247
Is everything all right?

33:38.584 --> 33:41.184
I just received word
that the English soldiers

33:41.186 --> 33:43.487
did not stop our
latest shipment.

33:43.489 --> 33:44.721
The grain got
to Canonbie.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.590
I needed to find
the leak

33:46.592 --> 33:48.725
and get food
to the villagers.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.727
I knew that if the English
forces believed

33:50.729 --> 33:52.462
that the grain was poisoned,

33:52.464 --> 33:54.798
they'd allow the shipment
to pass through.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.333
But then that's good news.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.201
You supplied the village
and found the leak.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.504
Not quite.

34:00.506 --> 34:03.607
I still don't know which of the
generals' wives is responsible.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.208
But you had
all four women followed.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.310
And none of them did
anything suspicious.

34:07.312 --> 34:09.780
Lady Calum
and Lady McEwan

34:09.782 --> 34:11.481
spent all day
in their chambers;

34:11.483 --> 34:13.417
Lady Innes, all day at church.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.218
Yes, well,
according to Lady McEwan,

34:15.220 --> 34:17.687
Lady Innes takes confession
daily for "impure thoughts."

34:17.689 --> 34:20.190
(laughs)

34:20.192 --> 34:22.559
And Lady Donal went into
the village, saw her dressmaker,

34:22.561 --> 34:24.494
and then stopped at
the blacksmith for some reason.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.596
Because she doesn't trust
her servants to do anything,

34:26.598 --> 34:28.298
not even sharpen
her husband's swords.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.300
That doesn't make sense.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.203
The Royal Armory takes care
of weapon maintenance.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.739
Then what was she doing
at the blacksmith?

34:35.741 --> 34:38.475
LADY DONAL:
Faster, faster!

34:38.477 --> 34:39.776
(gasps in pleasure)
Use the crop!

34:39.778 --> 34:41.278
CAPTAIN:
First tell me,

34:41.280 --> 34:43.346
when is the next shipment
to Canonbie?

34:43.348 --> 34:44.781
(gasps)
GUARD:
Lady Donal,

34:44.783 --> 34:46.716
on behalf of Queen Mary
and Scotland,

34:46.718 --> 34:48.718
you are under arrest
for treason.

34:48.720 --> 34:51.455
No! I didn't mean
to commit treason!

34:51.457 --> 34:53.824
I was seduced!
Oh, please, kill me now!

34:53.826 --> 34:55.492
I can't be beheaded
in front of my children!

34:59.698 --> 35:02.365
Good day.

35:02.367 --> 35:04.634
Lord James,
do you have a moment?

35:04.636 --> 35:07.104
Uh... of course,

35:07.106 --> 35:08.371
Lady Knox.

35:08.373 --> 35:09.773
Thank you.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.141
I beg your pardon?

35:11.143 --> 35:12.542
The belt I admired

35:12.544 --> 35:13.777
at the party arrived,

35:13.779 --> 35:15.779
with a note that was so caring.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.814
"It looks lovely no matter
how you wear it."

35:17.816 --> 35:20.383
How thoughtful of you
to ease my embarrassment,

35:20.385 --> 35:23.320
but I cannot accept your gift.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.788
Mrs. Knox, I don't know...
I am married.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.124
A gift,

35:27.126 --> 35:29.292
even one given out of pity,

35:29.294 --> 35:31.595
sympathy...

35:31.597 --> 35:33.797
I just can't accept it.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.532
But you...

35:35.534 --> 35:37.467
you are so kind.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.738
I'll have the gift
returned to you.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.773
We need not speak of this again.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.647
(sighs)

35:57.189 --> 35:58.755
James? What's wrong?

35:58.757 --> 36:01.358
Mary. She's scheming,
manipulative...

36:01.360 --> 36:03.460
Whatever Mary has done,
I'm sure she has her reasons.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.761
She has one reason
for everything she does:

36:04.763 --> 36:06.463
she is the queen.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.932
Which is a burden neither of us
can truly understand.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.800
You don't know what
she's been through.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.469
And while I know
it's not easy

36:12.471 --> 36:14.704
being in her circle,
it's usually worth it,

36:14.706 --> 36:16.273
because she has a good heart

36:16.275 --> 36:17.841
and she protects those
closest to her.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.413
(birds singing)

36:23.415 --> 36:24.681
(door opens)

36:27.886 --> 36:29.519
She let Knox go.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.221
Elizabeth couldn't hold him,

36:31.223 --> 36:32.455
and his disappearance
would have caused a scandal.

36:32.457 --> 36:33.790
The only scandal I care about

36:33.792 --> 36:35.458
is justice left undone.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.827
Are you sure what you seek
is justice and not vengeance?

36:37.829 --> 36:40.430
Against Knox,
but against Elizabeth, too.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.499
Your hatred of her
must have been convincing

36:42.501 --> 36:44.267
if it satisfied Knox.

36:44.269 --> 36:45.602
Hating Elizabeth was not
a difficult role to play,

36:45.604 --> 36:46.870
I'll grant you that.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.939
But as much as
it pains me to say,

36:48.941 --> 36:51.508
Lola was part of
an assassination attempt.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.543
Elizabeth had no choice--

36:53.545 --> 36:55.245
she had to punish her.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.480
She had no choice with Knox,
either, Lord Narcisse.

36:57.482 --> 36:59.916
Then it appears justice

36:59.918 --> 37:01.785
will have to wait.
There's a boat

37:01.787 --> 37:04.688
ready to take you and Lady
Lola's child back to France.

37:07.226 --> 37:10.293
I'll instruct the captain
to leave immediately.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.998
LADY LENNOX:
<i>Lord Narcisse, what a surprise.</i>

37:15.000 --> 37:17.634
I would have thought you'd be
halfway back to France

37:17.636 --> 37:19.336
the moment you got your freedom.

37:19.338 --> 37:20.670
And yet, I felt
oddly compelled

37:20.672 --> 37:22.005
to seek you out,
Lady Lennox.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.673
To offer my
congratulations

37:23.675 --> 37:26.276
on your son, Lord Darnley's,
imminent marriage

37:26.278 --> 37:27.844
to Lady Keira.

37:29.648 --> 37:30.914
You've made a mistake.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.516
Lady Keira is engaged
to Lord White.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.385
She was.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.953
But one hears many things
at English court.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.488
And what I hear

37:38.490 --> 37:42.025
is the queen made
a financial arrangement

37:42.027 --> 37:44.828
with Lord White
to cancel the engagement.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.399
Really?
Yes. Quite
a large sum, too.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.434
To be delivered in secret
by a single horseman...

37:51.436 --> 37:53.903
today.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.305
Why are you telling me this?

37:55.307 --> 37:56.506
'Cause you
don't want

37:56.508 --> 37:58.375
Elizabeth to get her way,

37:58.377 --> 37:59.943
and neither do I.

37:59.945 --> 38:03.313
She murdered my wife
and I despise her.

38:03.315 --> 38:06.383
Well, then, we can only
hope that the money

38:06.385 --> 38:07.717
arrives there safely.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.619
The roads are rife with danger.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.888
It would be such a shame
if that money went missing.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.857
NARCISSE:
<i> I daresay it would undo</i>

38:13.859 --> 38:16.359
<i> all of Elizabeth's hard work.</i>

38:16.361 --> 38:17.794
(horse whinnies)

38:17.796 --> 38:19.596
(man screams)

38:19.598 --> 38:21.564
(horse snorts)

38:23.869 --> 38:26.536
You sent Knox's wife

38:26.538 --> 38:28.338
a note and a gift from me,

38:28.340 --> 38:29.739
even after I made it clear

38:29.741 --> 38:32.008
that I do not wish to form
a relationship with her.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.677
Because I made it clear

38:33.679 --> 38:35.011
that we needed to move now,

38:35.013 --> 38:36.479
before Knox returned.

38:38.917 --> 38:43.753
And if I don't agree
to pursue this "friendship"?

38:43.755 --> 38:46.523
Then you will have, once again,
chosen Knox over me.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.491
And I won't be able
to protect you from him

38:48.493 --> 38:51.361
when he returns and finds that
you've given his wife a gift.

38:51.363 --> 38:52.629
Now you're threatening me!

38:52.631 --> 38:53.663
You leave me no other choice!

38:53.665 --> 38:55.031
And you, once again,

38:55.033 --> 38:57.634
are forcing my hand!

38:57.636 --> 38:58.835
(James sighs)

38:58.837 --> 39:00.637
Lady Greer wants me
to believe

39:00.639 --> 39:02.672
that you only do
what you must

39:02.674 --> 39:04.841
in order to protect
those closest to you,

39:04.843 --> 39:06.042
but she's wrong.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.912
Ever since you returned
to Scotland,

39:08.914 --> 39:10.547
you have sought to destroy
every alliance

39:10.549 --> 39:12.015
I worked so hard to build.

39:12.017 --> 39:15.118
The only alliance
you should have is with me!

39:15.120 --> 39:17.454
I have spies
in my own court,

39:17.456 --> 39:19.756
my Protestants are against me,

39:19.758 --> 39:23.760
my Catholic supporters
had me kidnapped.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.895
I said I could
do this alone,

39:25.897 --> 39:27.564
James, but I can't.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.566
I need your help.
Not just as your queen,

39:29.568 --> 39:31.000
but as your sister.

39:31.002 --> 39:33.403
I spent my childhood
isolated in a foreign land

39:33.405 --> 39:35.772
and now the only family
I have left

39:35.774 --> 39:37.474
is standing in front of me

39:37.476 --> 39:39.909
and I'm afraid
he's beginning to hate me.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.378
I don't want to hate you, Mary.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.579
Then don't!

39:42.581 --> 39:43.680
Aren't you tired

39:43.682 --> 39:45.648
of playing both sides

39:45.650 --> 39:47.050
and trusting neither?

39:48.687 --> 39:50.954
Aren't you tired
of being alone?

39:52.524 --> 39:53.857
More than you know.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.425
Then I beg of you,

39:55.427 --> 39:57.861
let us take a leap of faith

39:57.863 --> 40:01.431
and end our pattern
of lies and deceit

40:01.433 --> 40:04.100
and instead trust one another,

40:04.102 --> 40:05.869
be loyal
to one another,

40:05.871 --> 40:07.470
protect
one another.

40:07.472 --> 40:10.106
Because we are the only family
we have left.

40:12.144 --> 40:15.645
Pick a side, James...

40:15.647 --> 40:17.080
and let it be mine.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.982
Because unlike Knox,

40:18.984 --> 40:21.618
I will never betray you.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.121
You're right.

40:25.123 --> 40:27.690
We are all the family we have.

40:30.028 --> 40:33.096
And I am on your side.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.036
(door opens)
CATHERINE:
Charles.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.172
We need to talk.

40:42.174 --> 40:44.641
I can't. I'm tired.
I'm sorry.

40:44.643 --> 40:46.709
But I can't just
let you take to your bed,

40:46.711 --> 40:47.944
or whatever else it is
you choose to do

40:47.946 --> 40:48.978
rather than be king.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.047
Not when your sister
is determined

40:51.049 --> 40:53.516
to sink her claws
into France.

40:53.518 --> 40:56.453
I cannot stop her,
I cannot save France.

40:56.455 --> 40:57.954
I have tried and I have failed.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.489
(sighs)

40:59.491 --> 41:00.924
I know that I am not regent,

41:00.926 --> 41:02.992
but I am your mother

41:02.994 --> 41:04.761
and I am not going
to sit by and watch

41:04.763 --> 41:06.062
while both my son

41:06.064 --> 41:08.898
and my country slip away.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.034
Let me help you.

41:11.036 --> 41:13.903
Please.
Tell me, what is wrong?

41:13.905 --> 41:16.506
Is that the paperwork
to bring Narcisse home?

41:16.508 --> 41:17.507
Yes, it is, but...

41:17.509 --> 41:18.608
Leave it.

41:18.610 --> 41:19.776
I'll sign it.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.611
That's what you want, isn't it?

41:21.613 --> 41:22.779
Charles, what I want...

41:22.781 --> 41:25.114
Put it down and go.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.251
Please, Mother.
