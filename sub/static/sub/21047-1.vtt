01:19.168 --> 01:22.379
- Nice ride.
- You should see the engine.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.710
You want me to take a look?
I am pretty handy.

01:25.743 --> 01:27.244
Mm, I bet.

You want to look under my hood,

Hey.

Got to make it to LA by sundown.

- Maybe next time, dude.
- Let's go get her.

03:17.534 --> 03:18.855
Why'd you stop?

03:18.940 --> 03:20.885
I was having so much fun.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.721
Out of gas.

03:23.035 --> 03:25.170
Well, that's too bad. I'm not.

03:25.337 --> 03:28.753
Why don't you hop in, and, uh,
I'll give you a ride to town.

03:28.815 --> 03:31.301
- Yeah, no, thanks.
- Hey, man, let's not do this.

03:31.408 --> 03:33.236
I wasted 500 bucks worth of gas

03:33.270 --> 03:36.239
chasing you through the desert,
so don't be a bitch.

03:36.273 --> 03:37.807
No one asked you to race, okay?

03:37.842 --> 03:40.017
Barry, she's right.

03:41.078 --> 03:43.151
- Please don't.
- Dude, come on.

03:43.213 --> 03:45.323
- Back off, Todd.
- Please, please, don't. Please.

03:45.349 --> 03:47.651
- Come on, man.
- Back up.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.320
Stop. Please. Please don't. Please.

03:50.354 --> 03:54.483
Now, you just hold still,
and this won't hurt a bit.

03:54.759 --> 03:58.194
Funny, I was just about to say that.

04:10.908 --> 04:13.303
All right, hurry up, Barry.

Arthur, he's a junkie.
Those are track marks.

- To who?

Hospitals don't have
a lot of use for junkie blood.

I just wanted water.

Put it in non-junkie terms for us.

- Doesn't matter.

08:57.448 --> 08:59.116
All I know is, when you work
for Sergeant Gower,

08:59.150 --> 09:01.292
- you stick to the rules.
- I don't care what Gower wants.

09:01.331 --> 09:02.980
Police went to shit when they
sold out contracts

Crime's down since we went private.

Don't make it worse.

and drinks are on me.

10:05.950 --> 10:07.551
Hey, Saint Arthur...

What about you?

10:13.406 --> 10:15.168
Those are from both of us.

10:16.527 --> 10:19.301
Must have collected these
while your camera was off today.

10:19.924 --> 10:21.558
Must have.

10:21.866 --> 10:25.836

10:25.906 --> 10:28.266
Ten teeth by Friday...

10:28.844 --> 10:30.930
or I'll have yours instead.

10:38.439 --> 10:40.097
Told you.

10:40.645 --> 10:43.457
Forget about the warehouse.
Come out with us tonight.

10:44.088 --> 10:45.846
Remember that first heat wave...

10:46.090 --> 10:49.315
the summer after the fracking quakes?
The whole city was rioting.

10:49.715 --> 10:52.784
I broke into a public storage
unit trying to steal some food.

10:52.897 --> 10:54.264
I got caught by a cop.

10:54.369 --> 10:56.246
Nice. I have a whole new
respect for you.

10:56.285 --> 10:58.368
Shut up for two seconds and listen.

10:58.403 --> 11:01.204
That was the year they lowered
the legal age to 13.

11:01.239 --> 11:03.540
I could have been tried as an adult.

11:03.574 --> 11:06.309
- So how'd you swing it?
- I didn't do a thing.

11:06.344 --> 11:07.804
He let me go.

11:08.012 --> 11:10.265
He said he didn't want to see
another kid hang.

11:10.648 --> 11:12.133
Saved my life.

11:12.350 --> 11:14.789

for this shit job?

11:15.253 --> 11:17.155

11:17.288 --> 11:18.819
No.

11:18.933 --> 11:21.134

we have a choice...

11:21.159 --> 11:23.101
to make this city a better place...

11:23.554 --> 11:26.563
or make a violent world more violent.

11:31.369 --> 11:33.124
Damn it.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.690
You gonna sit on your ass all night,

16:01.211 --> 16:04.906
a state-of-the-art pulse charge

16:04.953 --> 16:07.467
implanted at the base of the skull.

16:07.501 --> 16:09.695
A bit barbaric? Perhaps.

16:09.742 --> 16:12.514
Shamefully pedantic? Without a doubt.

16:12.571 --> 16:15.162
But by golly if it won't do the trick.

16:17.443 --> 16:20.193

the pulse charge...

17:01.933 --> 17:05.291
to celebrate the winners.

17:05.363 --> 17:08.930
But whoever comes in last...

17:09.402 --> 17:11.204
I'm sure you get the idea.

17:13.805 --> 17:16.070
It's fucking cop.

17:19.617 --> 17:21.851
Hey, asshole, you dented my car.

17:21.944 --> 17:25.377
Ma'am, stay calm. Stand back.
I've got this under control.

17:32.920 --> 17:36.222
Looks like we've got an uninvited guest.

17:36.301 --> 17:38.591
Take them. Bring them both.

17:38.626 --> 17:40.363
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:40.894 --> 17:43.620
- Hey!
- Get off me!

17:43.764 --> 17:45.231
- Hey, hey, get off me!
- Hey!

17:45.266 --> 17:46.399
Get off me!

17:50.573 --> 17:52.438
Hey!

17:56.110 --> 17:58.520
We have a decision to make.

17:59.043 --> 18:02.129
Is this guy friend or fuel?

18:02.249 --> 18:07.661
On the one hand,
he works for ContraCrime...

18:07.878 --> 18:09.879
the new breed of cop.

18:09.992 --> 18:12.927
- Fuel! Fuel! Fuel!
- No, no, no!

18:15.067 --> 18:17.299
Then again...

18:17.494 --> 18:21.729
these two put on one hell of a show!

18:21.806 --> 18:23.744
Friend! Friend! Friend!

18:23.804 --> 18:26.229
Then again...

18:27.247 --> 18:30.052
he might try to stop the race.

18:30.228 --> 18:34.431
Fuel! Fuel! Fuel! Fuel! Fuel! Fuel!

18:34.723 --> 18:37.258
If the crowd grows restless,

18:37.332 --> 18:38.999
they get a bit stabby.

18:39.055 --> 18:41.036
Best put on a show.

19:00.025 --> 19:01.948
Asshole. I'll kill you!

19:08.408 --> 19:10.416
Link 'em up!

19:12.052 --> 19:15.430
Oh, no, no, no, no, hold on a minute.
We're not a team.

19:18.726 --> 19:21.204
You are now.

19:21.804 --> 19:24.406
And the fans love her!

19:26.934 --> 19:29.377
Freeze! Put your hands up now!

19:29.997 --> 19:32.365
Every single freak, on the ground

19:32.439 --> 19:34.204
with hands on your head.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.812
Fuck you, cop.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.876
- Christopher!
- Racers to your marks!

19:42.923 --> 19:44.791
Everyone else,
see you at the rendezvous.

19:47.588 --> 19:48.821
Shit!

19:48.965 --> 19:51.465
Christopher, run!

19:52.270 --> 19:54.338
Chris, get out of here!

20:06.273 --> 20:09.395
Shut up, calm down, and do as I say.

save us both some misery.

22:26.279 --> 22:29.091
- I need to cut this thing out.
- Won't work.

22:29.146 --> 22:31.435
I heard a rumor that adrenaline
messes with them,

22:31.489 --> 22:33.692
but, God, if that's true,
it would take a hell of a lot,

22:33.739 --> 22:34.776
considering who they're injecting.

22:34.810 --> 22:36.544
- Then I need a phone.
- No way.

22:36.579 --> 22:38.079
Lady, I was this close to arresting

22:38.114 --> 22:40.582
these sons of bitches, okay?
I need to contact my precinct.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.362
Oh, my God. You have no clue, do you?

22:42.416 --> 22:43.877
You can't just arrest these people.

22:43.932 --> 22:45.720
What the hell do you think
just happened back there?

22:46.065 --> 22:49.616
I saw your friends grind up
innocent people for fun.

22:49.852 --> 22:51.764
Why would anyone use a car engine

22:51.827 --> 22:53.795
just to murder someone, Einstein?

22:56.545 --> 22:58.063
Those people were fuel?

22:59.668 --> 23:02.248
These cars run on human blood?

23:03.239 --> 23:05.068
Bingo.

23:06.909 --> 23:09.939
Dude, if you throw up
in my car, I swear to God...

23:10.946 --> 23:12.665
Why would anyone do that?

23:12.748 --> 23:14.610
Have you seen gas prices lately?

23:14.710 --> 23:16.478
Oh, come on.

23:18.788 --> 23:21.423
The people that forced you
to race, who are they?

23:21.496 --> 23:23.340
I wasn't forced.

23:23.519 --> 23:26.205
What kind of sick person
signs up for this? What...

23:26.295 --> 23:29.215
Everyone has something to prove
trying to claim that Primo title.

23:29.298 --> 23:30.964
Isn't that how you found it?

23:31.878 --> 23:34.136
Oh, no. I'm not like you.

23:34.363 --> 23:37.074
I'm a cop. I'm trying to help people.

23:37.206 --> 23:38.440
Bullshit.

23:38.668 --> 23:39.988
No one makes it to the Blood Drive

23:40.036 --> 23:42.372
without a little psycho
behind the eyes, pal.

23:45.784 --> 23:47.573
Miss...

23:48.275 --> 23:49.971
look me in the eye

23:50.519 --> 23:54.277
and tell me you're really okay
murdering people

23:54.490 --> 23:56.379
just to win a title.

23:56.715 --> 23:59.067
I don't give a shit
about being the Primo.

23:59.361 --> 24:01.463
But I do care about the $10 million.

24:01.848 --> 24:04.299
That's enough to get my sister
the help that she needs

24:04.333 --> 24:05.974
and set us up for life.

24:06.335 --> 24:08.997
And no one's gonna get
in the way of that happening.

24:11.965 --> 24:13.380
So buckle up, pal,

24:13.490 --> 24:15.877
'cause the last one to this
party tonight is a dead man.

24:15.978 --> 24:18.480
And so long as you have that
bomb implanted in your neck,

24:18.588 --> 24:20.384
you're no longer a cop.

24:20.491 --> 24:22.325
You're just another racer...

24:22.447 --> 24:24.185
and we're stuck with each other.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.803
Then we have a problem,

24:25.981 --> 24:29.083
'cause as long as I'm here,
no one's going in your engine,

24:29.158 --> 24:30.990
and that's a promise.

24:31.260 --> 24:33.514
Yeah, well...

24:33.896 --> 24:36.564
we'll just cross that bridge
when we come to it, shall we?

24:48.677 --> 24:50.729
<i>You have reached your water limit.</i>

24:50.799 --> 24:52.700
<i>Please step out of the shower.</i>

24:52.766 --> 24:55.010
You got to be kidding me.

24:57.270 --> 24:58.951
Thanks.

24:59.740 --> 25:01.574
Whoa, Sarge, what are you doing?

25:01.963 --> 25:03.976
Until we figure out
what the hell happened,

25:04.011 --> 25:05.291
you're on forced leave.

25:07.247 --> 25:10.440
Fuck that, Sarge. Are you shitting me?

25:10.518 --> 25:12.585
- I read the report.
- You heard what happened.

25:12.995 --> 25:17.325
At 0600, we approached...
blah, blah, blah, blah,

25:17.402 --> 25:20.341
"I hit my head
and can't remember the rest."

25:20.606 --> 25:22.091
Sign it...

25:22.770 --> 25:25.868
before ContraCrime
decides to fire you or sue you

25:25.961 --> 25:27.827
or break every bone in your face.

25:27.908 --> 25:29.103
That's not what happened.

25:29.139 --> 25:30.923
The day I let one of
my officers write "vampire car"

25:30.970 --> 25:34.273
in their report is the same day
I let you suck my dick.

25:34.932 --> 25:37.885
Now get dressed, go home, get drunk.

25:37.986 --> 25:39.353
Internal Affairs
will interview you tomorrow.

25:39.432 --> 25:41.408
No way. The docs cleared me.
I'm going back out there.

25:41.463 --> 25:43.955
- Those freaks have my partner.
- We will find Saint Arthur.

25:44.017 --> 25:47.560
But until ContraCrime
clears you, sit on your ass.

25:55.829 --> 25:57.596
Bullshit.

26:02.171 --> 26:04.022
You know I'm supposed
to report you for that.

26:04.093 --> 26:06.672
Great. Anyone else want to see my dick?

26:09.380 --> 26:11.944
So what? Are you gonna snitch?

26:14.047 --> 26:16.582
I'm gonna help you.

26:22.638 --> 26:25.654

26:26.009 --> 26:28.680
No.

26:32.912 --> 26:34.748
- Come on, man.
- Shut up.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.202
Come on, I'm begging you.

26:36.279 --> 26:37.703
Beg all you want.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.805
I'm gonna start cutting off pieces.

- Just when the tank needed a topping off.
- No, no, no, no, no.

32:01.850 --> 32:04.327
It'd be a shame to mar
such a lovely mug.

32:04.420 --> 32:05.987
Maybe I'll cut it off.

32:06.100 --> 32:09.410
Get The Scholar to wear it.
Might spice things up a bit.

32:09.972 --> 32:12.039
Rules or no rules, he can mess you up.

32:12.136 --> 32:13.469
I don't care.

32:13.644 --> 32:15.698
It's your face. Suit yourself.

32:15.723 --> 32:17.065
They have families waiting for them.

32:17.099 --> 32:18.982
Did you ever think about that?

32:19.007 --> 32:20.574
Or can you justify anything?

32:25.819 --> 32:28.779
You hurt them, next time we meet,
I'll do this to you.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.458
Oh, very well.

32:34.765 --> 32:36.275
Blood under the bridge.

32:36.285 --> 32:39.889
I promise I will not kill these ladies.

32:40.048 --> 32:41.827
We'll free them once you're gone.

32:41.925 --> 32:43.921
Okay, she'll run.

32:44.026 --> 32:46.374
Very good. Your chariot awaits.

32:46.428 --> 32:48.363
How can we be sure he fixed it right?

32:48.522 --> 32:50.999
The Scholar is infuriatingly detailed

32:51.071 --> 32:52.173
when it comes to his machines.

32:52.231 --> 32:55.618
It's his obsession.
My obsession is good manners.

32:57.416 --> 32:59.584
I am The Gentleman after all.

32:59.775 --> 33:02.739
We will keep our word to the letter.

33:03.078 --> 33:05.434
But if we meet on the road again,

33:05.784 --> 33:08.731
well, that's another matter.

33:13.081 --> 33:14.781
Let's go.

33:19.461 --> 33:22.048
Ticktock, Barbie. We're way behind.

33:22.188 --> 33:24.321
If you kill them,
I'll find out about it.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.391
If I fail to keep my promise,

33:26.520 --> 33:28.622
I will welcome your vengeance.

33:32.141 --> 33:34.283
Is everybody a psychopath?

33:40.115 --> 33:42.166
How long will their engine hold?

33:42.484 --> 33:44.536
About two, three hours, tops.

33:50.492 --> 33:55.630
Ladies, unfortunately
your lives are not mine to take.

33:59.727 --> 34:03.221
Your tongue and your fingers

34:03.334 --> 34:05.502
on the other hand...

34:20.804 --> 34:22.245
_

34:55.529 --> 34:56.963
Do you like it?

34:57.342 --> 35:00.383
They made it especially
for you, Christopher.

35:02.997 --> 35:04.692
Then you fucked up.

35:05.523 --> 35:08.020
You should have just kidnapped me
instead of tricking me down here.

35:08.093 --> 35:09.527
Where's the fun in that?

35:12.596 --> 35:13.797
Holy shit.

35:32.950 --> 35:34.496
Look...

35:34.706 --> 35:36.567
you made me wet.

35:43.856 --> 35:45.456
Hi.

35:47.868 --> 35:51.508
Forget the fracking tubes.
You're gonna be too much fun.

36:43.668 --> 36:46.502
You're lucky we're still in the race
after that stunt you pulled.

36:46.542 --> 36:48.987
Now we have to haul ass 'cause
we're in the back of the pack.

36:51.318 --> 36:53.119
- What'd you do?
- Nothing.

37:03.447 --> 37:05.715
- What is it?
- Radiator.

37:05.813 --> 37:08.218
It has a hole in it. Give me your shirt.

37:08.290 --> 37:10.220
What?

37:17.525 --> 37:18.726
Shit.

37:23.899 --> 37:26.267
- Go. Fill her up.
- With what?

37:26.332 --> 37:28.528
Do I really need to explain it to you?

37:28.614 --> 37:31.064
Oh, no, I'm not getting my
dick anywhere near that engine.

37:31.134 --> 37:32.351
You are if you want to live.

37:34.044 --> 37:38.318
Our next team
is less than a half mile away.

37:40.223 --> 37:41.934
Shit.

37:44.088 --> 37:45.766
You know, it doesn't
really work this way.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.619
Then make it work that way,
or we're dead.

37:47.635 --> 37:50.807
So let's grab our drinks, our food,

37:50.939 --> 37:54.510
and the hottest piece of ass
you can find,

37:54.609 --> 37:57.674
and we'll all gather

37:57.779 --> 38:00.260
at the finish line!

38:02.951 --> 38:04.351
Okay, no pressure.

38:04.385 --> 38:07.659
Shit. Those were the last two.

38:07.755 --> 38:10.724
Okay. Okay, go, go, go, go.

38:24.136 --> 38:26.306
- Come on.
- The engine's maxed out.

38:26.491 --> 38:28.291
We're not gonna make it.

38:28.316 --> 38:29.802
- Maybe we can, uh...
- Screw it.

38:29.844 --> 38:31.153
If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna do
it at the finish line.

38:31.178 --> 38:32.813
No, there's got to be
something we can do.

38:32.847 --> 38:35.222
Didn't you say adrenaline
can short out the bombs?

38:35.247 --> 38:38.716
Barbie, there's no way
that we can get enough to...

38:40.155 --> 38:41.355
Shit.

- What? Why?

38:58.321 --> 39:01.368
We need adrenaline to override
the brain bombs, dumb-ass.

39:01.690 --> 39:03.735
Fuck. What's happening?

39:03.811 --> 39:05.178
- Do you want to live or not?
- Yeah, I want to live.

39:05.232 --> 39:07.475
Adrenaline's our only play,
but it's got to be a hell of a lot.

39:07.553 --> 39:09.149

out of another loss tomorrow.

41:38.637 --> 41:43.117
I let you live
because I enjoy a good show,

41:43.203 --> 41:45.727
but you try that trick one more time

41:45.884 --> 41:48.079
or even bore me for a single moment,

41:48.259 --> 41:50.751
you'll see what I'm really capable of.

this little paradise I've created?

42:07.561 --> 42:09.826
No, I'm not.

Oh, really?

You earned it.

43:40.858 --> 43:42.793
I'll help you win.

43:42.936 --> 43:45.066
You keep all the money.

43:45.433 --> 43:48.683
- Just promise me one thing.
- What?

43:49.457 --> 43:53.298
We're gonna see every one
