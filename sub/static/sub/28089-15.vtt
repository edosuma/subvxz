00:19.890 --> 00:22.460
- Can you hear me, Mr. Morden?
- Yes.

00:22.493 --> 00:26.431
<i>Cue the recap!
Paraguay vacay made me this way.</i>

00:26.463 --> 00:29.600
<i>A harbinger of chaos brought
to make this geezer pay.</i>

00:29.634 --> 00:33.005
I strung along the Dumb Patrol,
<i>flipped the bus into a hole,</i>

00:33.037 --> 00:36.607
<i>slammed it shut. Wait, what?
Stuffed it up a donkey's butt!</i>

00:36.609 --> 00:38.475
- Any sign of the Chief?
- We know he's alive.

00:38.475 --> 00:40.478
<i>A team was
forged with one belief,</i>

00:40.512 --> 00:44.247
<i>to stop at nothing
and get their Chief.</i>

00:44.281 --> 00:46.417
<i>Nazi-beating,
doomsday-cheating,</i>

00:46.451 --> 00:48.552
<i>beard hair-eating,
romance-hating,</i>

00:48.585 --> 00:50.354
<i>punk to skunk, robot chunk,</i>

00:50.387 --> 00:52.222
flashback dancing with a hunk,

00:52.256 --> 00:54.424
<i>gator-baiting,
half chub-dating,</i>

00:54.459 --> 00:56.426
<i>sliming through
a metal grating,</i>

00:56.460 --> 00:59.597
<i>death cult all around,
Jane survived the Underground,</i>

00:59.631 --> 01:03.267
<i>Ant Farm, Larry harmed,
delivering justice with a swarm.</i>

01:03.301 --> 01:04.736
- No!
<i>- Father-doting,</i>

01:04.769 --> 01:08.338
<i>hand-exploding, pain obscured
through secret coding.</i>

01:08.373 --> 01:10.240
<i>Growing close
with each endeavor,</i>

01:10.274 --> 01:11.977
<i>finally they came together.</i>

01:12.010 --> 01:14.379
<i>But I grew bored</i>

01:14.412 --> 01:15.513
<i>with this game of chase</i>

01:15.546 --> 01:17.649
<i>and trapped them inside
the white space.</i>

01:17.682 --> 01:19.316
<i>Backed their leader
against the wall,</i>

01:19.349 --> 01:21.084
<i>forcing him to spill it all.</i>

01:21.117 --> 01:23.953
I was responsible
for everything

01:23.987 --> 01:25.924
that has happened
to each of you.

01:25.956 --> 01:30.367
<i>This is
the best timeline ever!</i>

02:48.171 --> 02:49.372
Why?

02:49.407 --> 02:52.175
I needed you.

02:52.209 --> 02:54.344
I wanted...

02:54.377 --> 02:57.314
what you have.

02:57.348 --> 02:58.748
Immortality.

02:58.782 --> 03:00.683
What?

03:00.717 --> 03:04.187
I wanted to...

03:04.221 --> 03:07.358
I needed to...

03:07.390 --> 03:11.094
Motherfucker!

03:13.030 --> 03:14.798
I'm so sorry.

03:20.804 --> 03:23.106
Liar.

03:23.139 --> 03:24.974
You lied to Jane.

03:25.008 --> 03:28.012
You lied to all of us.

03:38.423 --> 03:41.272
Please let them go.

03:44.429 --> 03:46.663
What do you take me for, Niles?

03:46.698 --> 03:49.633
This was never about them.

03:49.667 --> 03:52.036
Making Silly Putty
out of their fragile,

03:52.068 --> 03:54.138
fractured brains,

03:54.170 --> 03:55.973
well, that...

03:56.006 --> 03:58.109
that was all just

03:58.141 --> 04:00.692
extra-curricular.

04:03.514 --> 04:05.550
Consider them
abandoned conquests.

04:05.582 --> 04:07.953
Their future is their own now.

04:07.985 --> 04:09.888
God, I wonder what
they'll do with it. Hmm?

04:09.920 --> 04:11.956
What does a family do
when they realize

04:11.990 --> 04:14.592
they're no family at all?
They're just rats

04:14.626 --> 04:16.394
in neighboring cages.

04:16.427 --> 04:19.163
They're just petri dishes
on the same shelf.

04:19.196 --> 04:21.966
You know,
I huffed and I puffed,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.867
but it was you all along,
wasn't it, Niles?

04:24.867 --> 04:28.839
You destroyed them!

04:28.872 --> 04:33.872
Just like you destroyed
Eric Morden.

04:34.579 --> 04:38.182
So you've had your revenge.

04:38.214 --> 04:39.651
What now?

04:39.684 --> 04:43.254
Why,
sky's the limit, old friend.

04:43.288 --> 04:46.189
I'm going to conduct a parade,
I'm gonna guest-host <i>The View,</i>

04:46.223 --> 04:47.891
I'm gonna become
the next Bachelor!

04:47.925 --> 04:50.427
The world is a golden oyster
for me now.

04:50.428 --> 04:52.295
But for you,

04:52.329 --> 04:54.932
Niles Caulder,

04:54.966 --> 04:59.966
I envision a story
that's a little different.

05:00.550 --> 05:05.571
I've been waiting decades
to ask you this.

05:06.571 --> 05:11.411
How does it feel
to be a nobody?

05:31.935 --> 05:33.971
<i>Security to
Containment Block Seven.</i>

05:34.004 --> 05:38.776
<i>All security to
Containment Block Seven.</i>

05:38.810 --> 05:41.245
- Good morning, Joshua.
- Bureau astronomers have

05:41.245 --> 05:42.547
confirmed your calculations.

05:42.579 --> 05:45.483
Next week's X-15 test flight
is our clearest shot yet

05:45.516 --> 05:47.451
to intercept the space anomaly.

05:47.485 --> 05:49.653
- Very good then.
- Meaning, after we knock

05:49.687 --> 05:50.988
this pilot from the sky...

05:51.021 --> 05:52.622
His name is
Larry Trainor by the way,

05:52.656 --> 05:54.925
Captain Larry Trainor,
wife, two kids.

05:54.959 --> 05:56.995
After we expose him
to unknown space matter,

05:57.028 --> 05:58.997
after we potentially burn
and radiate him

05:59.029 --> 06:01.833
beyond the known limits
of human capacity,

06:01.865 --> 06:03.668
then we're gonna
hand him over to Forsythe

06:03.701 --> 06:05.502
and his animals? For what?

06:05.536 --> 06:07.637
And Forsythe will
grow bored with his new toy,

06:07.672 --> 06:09.807
and then he'll be ours.
Hopefully forever.

06:09.841 --> 06:11.209
The Immortus Project
is working.

06:11.242 --> 06:15.045
Rita Farr has shown
zero signs of aging since 1955.

06:15.079 --> 06:18.281
We already have
a perfectly good test subject.

06:18.314 --> 06:21.165
Now we'll have two.

06:24.721 --> 06:29.593
Where's the line, Niles?

06:29.627 --> 06:31.629
'Cause I can't see it anymore.

06:31.661 --> 06:34.732
The only thing that should
trouble you, Joshua,

06:34.766 --> 06:36.067
is the alternative.

06:36.100 --> 06:39.937
Except I don't know
what the alternative is.

06:39.971 --> 06:44.341
The only way I sleep
at night is because...

06:44.375 --> 06:48.278
you tell me nothing.

06:48.312 --> 06:53.211
You're right.
And you're welcome.

07:05.196 --> 07:08.045
Oh, God.

07:14.139 --> 07:16.607
- Good morning, Larry.
- Apparently it is.

07:19.911 --> 07:23.180
I've been looking forward
to this day all semester.

07:23.214 --> 07:27.084
My students are finally
performing their scene studies,

07:27.117 --> 07:29.519
and I can't wait
to see how they utilize

07:29.553 --> 07:31.288
the techniques
that I've taught them.

07:31.322 --> 07:36.226
I suspect I'll be
handing out a lot of A's.

07:36.259 --> 07:37.528
Uh-huh.

07:37.562 --> 07:40.331
It feels so good to give back
to the community.

07:40.363 --> 07:42.098
We should've
done this ages ago.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.168
- What?
- Move on.

07:44.201 --> 07:46.637
Six months ago we learned
our lives had been destroyed

07:46.637 --> 07:48.773
by a madman.
Excuse me if it takes

07:48.773 --> 07:53.773
more than a moment
to get back my sea legs.

07:56.781 --> 07:58.415
When we moved into this place,

07:58.449 --> 07:59.918
we made a promise
to each other.

07:59.951 --> 08:04.120
- I know, but...
- No more hiding.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.122
I know.

08:05.154 --> 08:07.855
- I'm trying.
- Mmm.

08:44.027 --> 08:45.976
Okay.

08:50.333 --> 08:51.635
What do you think?

08:51.668 --> 08:54.504
You wanna try
for 20 seconds this time?

08:57.206 --> 08:59.342
Negative Spirit, release!

09:04.649 --> 09:08.249
Huh.

09:13.825 --> 09:16.527
There you go, buddy.

09:16.559 --> 09:18.562
We can do this.

09:18.596 --> 09:22.346
We can do this.
We can...

09:27.505 --> 09:31.341
Hit the bricks, sister.
We're... we're done. Finito.

09:31.341 --> 09:32.341
You don't mean that, Kyle.

09:32.341 --> 09:34.379
I know you better
than you know yourself.

09:34.412 --> 09:37.881
You wanna pick me up
in those strong arms.

09:37.914 --> 09:41.351
Cut. Cut.

09:41.384 --> 09:43.153
Jagger, Esme,

09:43.187 --> 09:46.890
you failed
to move your audience.

09:46.923 --> 09:50.760
We didn't feel it
because you didn't feel it.

09:50.794 --> 09:53.663
Mmm? Let me show
what it looks like

09:53.697 --> 09:58.697
when you really connect
to your character.

10:02.105 --> 10:06.905
And... action!

10:06.977 --> 10:09.312
Hit the bricks, sister.

10:09.346 --> 10:11.381
We're done. Finito.

10:11.414 --> 10:15.186
You don't mean that, Kyle. Hmm?

10:15.220 --> 10:18.655
I know you
better than you know yourself.

10:18.688 --> 10:22.559
You wanna pick me up
in these strong arms

10:22.592 --> 10:27.163
and devour me whole.

10:27.197 --> 10:28.697
And scene.

10:32.636 --> 10:35.173
And that, children,

10:35.206 --> 10:38.676
Is what serious dedication
to your craft gets you.

10:38.708 --> 10:40.677
Being a shitty high school
drama teacher?

10:40.711 --> 10:43.714
Wow. Dare to dream.

10:43.748 --> 10:45.182
It's scary not to excel

10:45.182 --> 10:47.717
at something we aspire
to do, isn't it, Esme?

10:47.751 --> 10:49.519
I'm not excelling?

10:49.552 --> 10:51.422
I can't think
of anything sadder

10:51.455 --> 10:52.923
than some washed-up never-was

10:52.956 --> 10:55.759
who gets their jollies off
out-acting a bunch of teenagers

10:55.793 --> 10:57.894
who only took this class
for the easy A.

11:10.072 --> 11:11.609
Larry!

11:11.642 --> 11:14.379
Hurry up! You're missing
the booty song.

11:14.412 --> 11:17.981
Do either of you two
want to buy Marvin Gardens?

11:18.015 --> 11:19.317
Honestly,
I could use the cash.

11:19.350 --> 11:22.687
Hmm. Larry! This is
absolutely unacceptable!

11:22.720 --> 11:24.389
1976 is ending,

11:24.422 --> 11:29.422
and you're stalling
like some truculent schoolboy.

11:38.001 --> 11:43.001
Uh, now, I believe
it's your turn.

11:44.075 --> 11:48.078
Ugh, I look ridiculous.

11:48.111 --> 11:51.181
No.

11:51.215 --> 11:53.317
Now, then, Rita,

11:53.350 --> 11:54.684
that's not fair.

11:59.057 --> 12:02.994
Oh, yeah, sure. Laugh it up.

12:03.027 --> 12:05.897
All right. Keep playing.

12:05.929 --> 12:07.432
And don't cheat.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.465
- He's talking to you.
- Uh-huh.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.778
Forsythe.

12:21.812 --> 12:23.780
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:23.813 --> 12:25.816
Wonderful home, Dr. Caulder.

12:25.850 --> 12:27.650
And a happy New Year's Eve.

12:27.684 --> 12:29.452
You need to leave.

12:29.485 --> 12:31.322
Oh.

12:31.355 --> 12:34.825
I'm afraid the matter at hand
is rather urgent.

12:34.859 --> 12:37.260
What is it?

12:37.293 --> 12:38.730
You know,

12:38.764 --> 12:42.499
when the brass told me in '68
I'd be losing Captain Trainor

12:42.533 --> 12:44.835
to your Immortus Initiative,

12:44.869 --> 12:47.004
I have to say,
I couldn't have imagined

12:47.038 --> 12:50.206
his new assignment would
be quite so...

12:50.240 --> 12:51.241
cozy.

12:51.275 --> 12:54.044
Mmm. Well, you have
your methods, I have mine.

12:54.077 --> 12:57.147
The work we do here
is just as essential.

12:57.179 --> 12:58.482
Yes.

12:58.515 --> 13:01.052
I can see that now.

13:01.085 --> 13:02.620
What is that song?

13:02.653 --> 13:04.687
My daughter likes that one.

13:04.721 --> 13:08.322
Cut the bullshit, Agent.

13:09.759 --> 13:11.962
What's that?

13:11.995 --> 13:14.498
Well, I believe
you once called it

13:14.530 --> 13:16.100
the "unrelenting",

13:16.134 --> 13:20.104
uncompromising pursuit
of truth."

13:20.138 --> 13:22.105
Your signature is
required, Doctor.

13:22.139 --> 13:23.975
Our investigators
have identified

13:24.008 --> 13:26.977
your next test subject.

13:27.010 --> 13:32.010
What are you talking about?
I... I never...

13:36.287 --> 13:39.090
That request was made
over a decade ago.

13:39.123 --> 13:40.424
And now we've found her.

13:40.457 --> 13:43.960
Hispanic female,
multiple personality disorder.

13:43.961 --> 13:48.499
By all accounts,
a real wildcat.

13:48.499 --> 13:49.668
I think you'll agree

13:49.701 --> 13:54.701
she fits perfectly the profile
you asked us to find.

14:24.534 --> 14:26.070
Jane.

14:26.104 --> 14:29.573
- Did you know?
- About what?

14:29.607 --> 14:34.607
About what that sadistic fuck
did to us, you fucking...

14:36.746 --> 14:40.717
No, no, no.

14:40.750 --> 14:44.687
He promised!

14:44.721 --> 14:48.392
Jane.

14:48.424 --> 14:53.163
Jane.

14:53.197 --> 14:57.568
Hey, it's okay.

14:57.601 --> 15:00.171
He was going to cage us here.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.673
Cage us like the rest of them.

15:02.706 --> 15:04.174
Wasn't he?

15:04.207 --> 15:06.477
Singing caged birdies

15:06.510 --> 15:11.510
with pretty feathers
for the master to pluck!

15:12.317 --> 15:16.886
It's okay.

15:16.921 --> 15:18.421
It's okay.

15:22.592 --> 15:27.431
Just tell me. Please.

15:27.464 --> 15:30.067
I knew.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.370
I can give you
the spiel, but...

15:32.403 --> 15:35.139
the truth is, I was blind.

15:35.173 --> 15:38.975
Willfully blind.

15:39.009 --> 15:42.212
You need to make it go away.

15:42.245 --> 15:45.883
- I know it's difficult...
- You don't know.

15:45.916 --> 15:49.787
I keep having this dream.

15:49.820 --> 15:53.990
I find a wound on my chest.

15:54.024 --> 15:58.363
This old wound
that's scabbed over.

15:58.395 --> 16:01.731
And I know
I shouldn't touch it,

16:01.764 --> 16:04.335
but I keep reaching for it,

16:04.369 --> 16:06.538
and I can't help but scratch.

16:06.571 --> 16:10.274
And the wound gets bigger
and bigger

16:10.307 --> 16:15.258
until there's
nothing of me left.

16:19.049 --> 16:21.485
There's a drug.

16:21.518 --> 16:24.288
An opiate.

16:24.322 --> 16:26.756
For meta-human powers.

16:26.789 --> 16:29.059
Niles created it.

16:29.092 --> 16:32.897
Gave it to me
for safe keeping,

16:32.929 --> 16:34.899
so he wouldn't be tempted.

16:44.075 --> 16:46.845
It's not a fix or a cure.

16:46.878 --> 16:49.046
It calms the noise,
it makes it more manageable,

16:49.080 --> 16:52.917
but it doesn't discriminate.

16:52.950 --> 16:55.852
Jane, it quiets everything.

16:55.885 --> 16:59.289
The good and the bad.

16:59.323 --> 17:02.159
In order to use it safely,

17:02.192 --> 17:04.194
we'd have to stick
to a strict regimen.

17:04.228 --> 17:09.228
I have to monitor
your dosage, vitals...

18:19.135 --> 18:21.071
I'm sorry, Kay.

18:21.105 --> 18:23.106
It's okay.

18:23.140 --> 18:26.140
It feels better now.

18:51.167 --> 18:53.069
- Niles?
- Huh?

18:53.104 --> 18:55.653
Elinore? Elinore.

18:58.241 --> 19:03.114
Thank you for coming.

19:03.146 --> 19:05.450
This...

19:05.482 --> 19:08.385
He's my last research subject.

19:08.419 --> 19:12.655
He was a race car driver.

19:12.689 --> 19:15.058
Father.

19:15.092 --> 19:19.262
Husband.

19:19.297 --> 19:22.596
I'm afraid all that...

19:24.568 --> 19:29.568
This is hitting me
the hardest of all.

19:30.607 --> 19:34.944
The crash was supposed
to be on the racetrack.

19:34.979 --> 19:37.582
No one else was to get hurt.

19:37.615 --> 19:41.085
No one what?
What does that mean, he was "supposed to"?

19:41.117 --> 19:43.621
How would you know...

19:43.654 --> 19:45.388
that a man is
supposed to crash?

19:45.423 --> 19:48.492
It's all gone too far.

19:48.526 --> 19:50.259
It's all gone too far, Elinore.

19:50.260 --> 19:52.229
I used to think
I had no alternative.

19:52.262 --> 19:56.032
That there wasn't
an alternative, but it's...

19:56.067 --> 20:00.837
gone too far.

20:00.871 --> 20:02.070
Niles...

20:07.877 --> 20:10.582
I love you...

20:10.615 --> 20:14.117
as a mentor and a friend.

20:14.151 --> 20:15.353
And you are scaring

20:15.385 --> 20:18.221
the ever-loving fuck
out of me right now.

20:18.256 --> 20:22.859
I need to tell you something.

20:22.893 --> 20:26.196
And I need you to promise

20:26.230 --> 20:30.334
when it's finished

20:30.367 --> 20:35.018
that you'll still be my friend.

20:39.210 --> 20:41.912
Cliff! Your order's up.

20:41.912 --> 20:42.912
Yo!

21:56.921 --> 22:00.223
You know how much
I cared for Elinore.

22:00.257 --> 22:03.294
She would have
wanted it this way.

22:03.326 --> 22:06.596
For Victor to survive.

22:06.631 --> 22:10.667
There's some comfort in that.

22:10.701 --> 22:13.336
Cold comfort.

22:13.371 --> 22:14.971
But thank you.

22:15.005 --> 22:16.641
If I may...

22:16.673 --> 22:19.509
one piece of advice.

22:19.544 --> 22:21.645
If there's one thing
I've learned from my research,

22:21.679 --> 22:24.382
Victor is going
to need special care.

22:24.414 --> 22:26.584
No offense,

22:26.616 --> 22:28.720
but we are not talking

22:28.752 --> 22:32.490
about homeschooling
my son's recovery here.

22:32.522 --> 22:33.857
S.T.A.R. Labs has it covered.

22:33.892 --> 22:37.929
I'm not talking
about technology or facilities.

22:37.961 --> 22:42.333
There's a holistic component
to be considered.

22:42.365 --> 22:45.670
Patience. Empathy.

22:45.702 --> 22:47.605
And I'm not capable
of giving it.

22:47.637 --> 22:49.306
Is that what you're saying?

22:49.339 --> 22:53.539
No, I'm... I just suggest...

22:55.011 --> 22:56.814
You might be surprised

22:56.847 --> 23:01.847
just how much of a tonic
compassion can be.

23:03.054 --> 23:05.722
And exactly who do you think
you're fooling here?

23:05.722 --> 23:10.528
Hmm? You talk
about compassion? Empathy?

23:10.560 --> 23:12.778
Like you invented it?

23:13.663 --> 23:17.087
I'm...

23:17.087 --> 23:20.570
I was her husband.

23:20.571 --> 23:24.075
And you don't think
she told me what you did?

23:24.108 --> 23:29.717
You think you have any standing
to lecture me about family?

23:30.500 --> 23:33.416
I just put
my son back together.

23:33.451 --> 23:35.019
My son!

23:35.053 --> 23:37.788
And you think that
you and I are the same?

23:37.821 --> 23:41.358
You think what you did...

23:41.392 --> 23:44.394
and what I did are the same?

23:44.428 --> 23:47.096
This wasn't some experiment.

23:47.096 --> 23:49.333
I turned my...

23:49.366 --> 23:53.671
sweet, affable, athletic,

23:53.704 --> 23:57.541
charming, delicious boy

23:57.541 --> 24:01.077
into a freak of nature.

24:01.111 --> 24:04.749
I did it out of love.

24:04.781 --> 24:07.351
Why the hell
did you do it, Niles?

24:07.384 --> 24:09.353
To those people?

24:09.386 --> 24:14.057
You speak to me
about compassion?

24:14.090 --> 24:16.626
Don't ever.

24:16.661 --> 24:18.911
Don't you dare.

24:40.483 --> 24:42.185
Who are you?

24:42.219 --> 24:43.788
Me?

24:43.820 --> 24:47.990
I'm you.

24:59.604 --> 25:01.439
Hey, Dad.

25:01.471 --> 25:04.141
<i>You okay, son?</i>

25:04.173 --> 25:06.044
Fine. Um...

25:06.076 --> 25:08.179
Just been up all night
working that bitcoin ring.

25:08.212 --> 25:11.000
<i>Well, you know,
if that cybercrime is</i>

25:11.000 --> 25:13.817
too dry for you, you can always
<i>go back out into the field.</i>

25:13.851 --> 25:15.287
My time's better spent
taking down

25:15.319 --> 25:18.355
international money launderers
than two-bit purse-snatchers.

25:18.388 --> 25:22.326
- Don't you think?
<i>- Um, of course.</i>

25:22.358 --> 25:24.127
<i>Either way,</i>

25:24.161 --> 25:25.896
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

25:25.930 --> 25:27.897
<i>I hope you know that.</i>

25:27.931 --> 25:29.400
Sure.

25:29.432 --> 25:31.234
Look, I gotta get back to it.

25:54.159 --> 25:56.661
Is there any sweeter feeling
than revenge?

25:57.894 --> 26:00.897
That's an excellent question,
Whoopi, and...

26:00.932 --> 26:02.599
I don't think that there is.

26:02.599 --> 26:04.234
And the only thing
that I'm more sure of

26:04.234 --> 26:07.104
is that it will never, ever,
ever go away!

26:13.010 --> 26:17.548
"A convoluted, meandering plot
that ends in a whimper."

26:17.580 --> 26:18.883
An impotent villain

26:18.915 --> 26:23.487
with a cliche approach
to revenge"!

26:23.520 --> 26:27.490
You know what, he's right.

26:27.525 --> 26:30.294
He's totally right!

26:30.326 --> 26:32.630
He's... he's totally right.

26:32.663 --> 26:34.731
At long last,
I have found you!

26:34.766 --> 26:38.036
No!

26:38.068 --> 26:41.505
Be still, you fudger!
Be still, I say!

26:41.538 --> 26:43.641
Did you just call me
a "fudger"?

26:43.673 --> 26:46.778
Silence, recreant!
For this is my time.

26:46.810 --> 26:48.246
I have waited centuries

26:48.279 --> 26:50.681
for the rapture foretold
in the scripture.

26:50.714 --> 26:52.916
Twice you have
brought us to its brink,

26:52.951 --> 26:54.585
and twice you have failed.

26:54.618 --> 26:56.686
Explain yourself!
I demand it!

26:56.721 --> 26:59.057
Well, I was going
for more of a personal tale

26:59.089 --> 27:01.459
of vengeance and betrayal.
You know...

27:01.491 --> 27:03.527
emotional stakes.

27:03.527 --> 27:06.029
Real premium cable shit.

27:06.064 --> 27:08.265
So, you're not
an agent of the Lord?

27:08.298 --> 27:09.933
No, there is no God.

27:09.968 --> 27:14.071
If there was, I wouldn't be
so devoid of purpose.

27:14.105 --> 27:15.772
Oh,
a crisis of faith!

27:15.807 --> 27:17.942
This is why
Father has led me to you,

27:17.976 --> 27:20.678
to set you back
on the path to His glory!

27:20.711 --> 27:24.516
Path to glory?
Oh, I like the sound of that.

27:24.548 --> 27:27.718
- To His glory.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

27:27.751 --> 27:29.653
To glory.

27:29.686 --> 27:32.990
Oh, but it's no use!

27:33.023 --> 27:36.394
I have already completed
my life's masterwork

27:36.428 --> 27:40.832
by turning everyone Niles
Caulder loves against him.

27:40.865 --> 27:45.635
There isn't a person alive
that he can call friend.

27:45.670 --> 27:48.605
No man, no woman...

27:48.638 --> 27:51.275
Woman.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.449
<i>I want the truth.</i>

27:58.481 --> 27:59.717
<i>Where is she?</i>

28:01.353 --> 28:05.656
It seems as though I left
some vengeance on the table.

28:05.691 --> 28:08.992
I really gotta amp things up this
time, really make a show of force!

28:09.027 --> 28:10.394
You need guys?

28:10.428 --> 28:13.298
I know a rat who spent
an entire afternoon

28:13.298 --> 28:17.701
exacting revenge on the robot
who killed his mother.

28:17.734 --> 28:19.703
Admiral Whiskers?

28:19.737 --> 28:23.673
I love that guy.

28:26.144 --> 28:29.079
This is a splendid start.
Who else?

28:29.113 --> 28:30.681
Hmm. You know what?

28:30.714 --> 28:33.750
Let's start small. A trinity.

28:33.784 --> 28:36.386
Hmm. Hmm, I like it.

28:36.420 --> 28:38.490
I like it. A menage-a-us.

28:38.522 --> 28:42.660
And we shall call ourselves The
Brotherhood of Dangerous Animals!

28:42.692 --> 28:44.061
Hosanna!

28:45.296 --> 28:50.268
Yes. It is tight,
Admiral Whiskers.

28:50.300 --> 28:55.101
Yes! And vengeance
will be mine!

28:55.772 --> 28:58.041
Again. For real this time.

28:58.076 --> 29:02.445
And when we get
Niles Caulder... again,

29:02.479 --> 29:04.815
the world will be ours!

29:07.684 --> 29:10.386
Then
we shall destroy it!

29:10.421 --> 29:13.257
Maybe.

29:13.289 --> 29:15.526
If there's time.

29:39.316 --> 29:41.751
Morning, dear.

29:41.786 --> 29:44.488
We hit 20 seconds yesterday.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.923
At least, I think we did.

29:46.958 --> 29:49.826
I passed out at some point.
But it felt longer.

29:49.859 --> 29:52.762
Bully for you.

29:52.797 --> 29:56.433
Rough day at school?

29:56.468 --> 30:01.468
I was emotionally assassinated
by a 13-year-old girl.

30:03.941 --> 30:06.211
I'm not even sure
what we're doing here, Larry.

30:06.243 --> 30:09.346
We're doing exactly what we
were doing back at the manor,

30:09.380 --> 30:10.382
just getting by.

30:10.414 --> 30:13.451
That's not enough for me.
Not anymore.

30:13.484 --> 30:17.521
There has to be more
to life than just this.

30:17.556 --> 30:19.957

30:37.641 --> 30:39.109
Hear what?

30:39.143 --> 30:41.878
Nothing!
Have a nice day now.

Eat shit, ginger!

30:43.881 --> 30:45.215
<i>♪ You'll be singing... ♪</i>

30:45.250 --> 30:48.619
- Disembodied singing.
- Never a good sign.

30:48.653 --> 30:53.490
Although, we could follow it.
See where it leads.

30:53.525 --> 30:56.027
It's not like
we have much to lose.

30:56.059 --> 30:57.394
No, just our lives.

30:57.429 --> 30:59.663
But, hey, we're living
on stolen time anyway,

30:59.698 --> 31:03.334
so why not take it for granted and dive
headlong into shark-infested waters

31:03.334 --> 31:05.135
that will undoubtedly
lead us back to the man

31:05.135 --> 31:06.938
who permanently disfigured us

31:06.971 --> 31:09.140
and lied to us
about it for decades?

31:09.173 --> 31:13.111

31:45.309 --> 31:48.412
No, Kay. Don't forget.

31:48.444 --> 31:50.213
You can't forget.

31:50.248 --> 31:52.048
I'll get her, Jane.

31:52.083 --> 31:53.931
Don't worry.

31:55.586 --> 31:56.354
Kay...

31:57.521 --> 32:00.724

32:00.759 --> 32:03.727
I know you think
this is how it has to be,

32:03.727 --> 32:06.096
but this isn't healing, Jane.

32:06.130 --> 32:11.130
Forgetting and hiding
isn't healing.

32:11.935 --> 32:16.306
You have to go up.

32:16.306 --> 32:20.111
I can't.

32:20.144 --> 32:22.980
We're safer here.

32:44.602 --> 32:48.705
You're the one who's been bringing
me cold food this whole time?

32:48.739 --> 32:50.074
For months?

32:50.106 --> 32:52.711
Um...

32:52.743 --> 32:55.213
Well, yeah, when I'm not busy.
I'm busy a lot, you know.

32:55.247 --> 32:58.682
There just happens to be a food truck
where I'm busy most, and I, um...

32:58.717 --> 33:01.251
I mean, it's not like
I could eat any of it.

33:01.285 --> 33:03.488
Thanks.

33:03.520 --> 33:06.022
Might be a little soggy.

33:06.057 --> 33:08.226
I tripped.
Manhole just came out of...

33:08.259 --> 33:10.161
Do you hear that music too?

33:10.193 --> 33:12.762
All morning.

33:12.796 --> 33:15.567
You, uh...

33:15.599 --> 33:18.035
You wanna go fuck up
whoever's playing it?

33:18.068 --> 33:19.903
Fuck, yeah!

33:19.936 --> 33:22.272

Can I just say there better be
a good fucking reason why we're here?

34:18.730 --> 34:23.001
And it better be
to turn off that fucking song.

34:23.034 --> 34:25.570
- - Because honestly,
I'd rather stick sharks in my vagina

34:25.603 --> 34:27.605
than be in the same
zip code as you.

34:27.639 --> 34:31.842
It's Mr. Nobody.
He's kidnapped Danny.

34:31.876 --> 34:36.146
- So, rescue Danny.
- I can't.

34:36.179 --> 34:38.730
I need your help.

34:50.293 --> 34:54.797
A long time ago,
I had a daughter.

34:54.833 --> 34:58.936
She's extraordinary
and everything to me,

34:58.969 --> 35:02.072
and I'm afraid...

35:02.106 --> 35:06.456
she is a danger to all of us.

35:07.644 --> 35:11.614
All I ever wanted was to live
one day longer than she did,

35:11.648 --> 35:13.884
to protect her.

35:13.918 --> 35:17.621
To protect others.

35:17.655 --> 35:22.655
That's why I created
each one of you.

35:27.164 --> 35:32.164
I need to study any means possible
of extending my own life.

35:34.371 --> 35:39.110
So, we were lab rats.
Just like Mr. Nobody said.

35:39.143 --> 35:43.014
Yes, at first.
I can't deny that.

35:43.047 --> 35:47.684
Okay, I'm sorry,
but invoking your daughter now,

35:47.717 --> 35:49.085
it's fucking evil.

35:49.119 --> 35:50.288
It's the truth.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.590
I hid her for years on Danny,

35:52.623 --> 35:57.623
who graciously accepted
to be her caretaker.

35:57.699 --> 35:59.862
Somehow,

35:59.896 --> 36:02.432
Mr. Nobody

36:02.432 --> 36:04.335
has found out about her,

36:04.367 --> 36:09.367
and he's trapped them both
inside this painting.

36:11.007 --> 36:15.079
Please.

36:15.112 --> 36:18.349
She's all I've got left.

36:18.382 --> 36:21.686
Tell you what. I'll help you
with your daughter

36:21.719 --> 36:25.289
as soon as you
invent a time machine

36:25.322 --> 36:29.360
that gets me back the 30 years
I lost with mine.

36:29.393 --> 36:34.099
Till then, fuck you forever!

36:34.132 --> 36:37.501
And Danny? You're just gonna
turn your back on them?

36:37.501 --> 36:39.003
Even though
they had no part in this?

36:39.003 --> 36:43.039
I'm sorry, what part of "fuck
you forever" was in Hebrew?

36:43.074 --> 36:45.577
I'll do it.

36:45.610 --> 36:48.246
For Danny.
Even your daughter.

36:50.014 --> 36:52.182
Not for you.

36:52.215 --> 36:54.585
Wait!
You're doing this?

36:54.619 --> 36:57.320
Niles Caulder, you're an awful,

36:57.355 --> 37:01.760
vermin-infested,
garbage... person.

37:01.793 --> 37:05.329
But so help me, I'm going
into that painting too.

37:05.362 --> 37:07.664
I was terrible
as a human being,

37:07.699 --> 37:12.070
and even worse
as an acting teacher.

37:12.103 --> 37:16.440
The only time I don't feel
like a complete asshole

37:16.474 --> 37:19.811
is when I'm dealing with...

37:19.844 --> 37:23.614
whatever you would
call this foolishness.

37:23.646 --> 37:25.248
Larry.

37:25.282 --> 37:27.751
Does my opinion
even matter?

37:27.751 --> 37:28.954
Cliff.

37:28.987 --> 37:31.922
Great! Now I'm the fucking
asshole who's a fucking asshole

37:31.922 --> 37:33.625
if I don't walk
into the fucking painting.

37:33.625 --> 37:35.900
Of course I'm gonna fucking
walk into the fucking painting,

37:35.900 --> 37:36.925
because, let's be honest,

37:36.925 --> 37:40.164
who the fuck else is enough of a fucking
asshole to walk into a fucking painting?

37:40.164 --> 37:42.599
Let's go!

37:42.634 --> 37:46.704
Okay, so get into
the painting... somehow,

37:46.737 --> 37:49.172
and then rescue Danny
and your daughter somehow.

37:49.206 --> 37:50.842
Getting in is gonna be
the easy part.

37:50.875 --> 37:52.844
It's the getting out
that's gonna be tricky.

37:52.876 --> 37:54.746
Why?
What do we have to do?

37:54.778 --> 37:57.780
I don't know. That's why
it's gonna be tricky.

37:57.815 --> 38:00.585
Ah. Okay.

38:02.052 --> 38:04.489
So, what do we do?
Just stare at this thing?

38:04.521 --> 38:06.891
Keep staring. Keep staring.

38:14.565 --> 38:16.300
Where is everyone?

38:18.436 --> 38:22.005
Danny, you okay?
What's going...

38:22.039 --> 38:25.789
Uh, can't see. All right.

38:31.248 --> 38:33.050
Danny, what about her?

38:33.083 --> 38:34.485
She safe?

38:36.521 --> 38:38.170
Uh... Guys?

38:47.297 --> 38:51.402
What the hell is that?

38:51.434 --> 38:54.204
Now comes
your reckoning!

38:54.237 --> 38:55.606
Oh, God.

38:55.639 --> 38:59.076
Behold!
I am His right hand.

38:59.108 --> 39:02.313
His scythe! Use me, Father!

39:02.346 --> 39:07.217
I am your disciple,
your fifth horseman!

39:07.251 --> 39:08.550
Take cover!

39:11.688 --> 39:14.190
Shit! Shit!

39:14.224 --> 39:15.458
Shit!

39:15.492 --> 39:20.492

Danny was right. You came.

39:30.742 --> 39:32.677
I'm so happy to see you guys.

39:32.677 --> 39:34.244
Man, what the hell are you doing?

39:35.780 --> 39:38.648
I fucked up. I fucked up.

39:38.682 --> 39:42.119
I fucked up so hard.

39:42.152 --> 39:44.554
I was happy here, you know.

39:44.588 --> 39:47.759
This guy shows up,
Mr. Nobody, offering me

39:47.791 --> 39:52.128
bags of Lincoln,
da Vinci, ZZ Top.

39:52.161 --> 39:55.666
Their beards tasted so good.

39:55.699 --> 39:59.336
And I told him...

39:59.369 --> 40:01.505
I told him everything.

40:01.539 --> 40:06.344
You sold her out.

40:15.353 --> 40:16.952
What did you do?

40:16.952 --> 40:18.389
What did I do?

40:18.422 --> 40:21.960
I mean, sure, I trapped Danny
in this goddamn painting

40:21.992 --> 40:25.963
before realizing that
it would turn me into this...

40:25.963 --> 40:27.197
this husk!

40:27.231 --> 40:29.733
All I wanted to do

40:29.766 --> 40:32.036
was to meet that Cro-Magnon
squeeze of yours,

40:32.070 --> 40:34.271
and lo and behold,
all that remains

40:34.306 --> 40:37.809
is an adorable, almighty
chip off the old block.

40:37.842 --> 40:40.478
If you so much as harmed
a hair on her head...

40:43.215 --> 40:48.052
She enlarged those two
backstabbing vermin!

40:48.085 --> 40:50.989
Have you ever tried
talking sense to a pest

40:51.021 --> 40:55.226
while he enjoys his very own
re-enactment of a Kaiju movie?

40:55.226 --> 40:56.360
It is impossible!

40:56.393 --> 40:58.396
Shut up!
Look, we need a plan.

40:58.429 --> 41:00.931
Look, we were the only people
in this whole entire world

41:00.965 --> 41:03.235
who got Danny's SOS
and followed it here.

41:03.268 --> 41:05.936
We're standing inside the heart
of a sentient street,

41:05.969 --> 41:08.672
inside a magic painting
with a giant-ass cockroach,

41:08.706 --> 41:09.907
a guy who hunts beards, and...

41:09.940 --> 41:12.175
And an inter-dimensional
fuck-up.

41:14.012 --> 41:16.047
If anybody's gonna save Danny

41:16.081 --> 41:19.483
and the Chief's daughter,
it's gonna be us.

41:19.516 --> 41:22.967
Fine. What's this plan?

41:27.458 --> 41:30.295
This way. Quickly!

41:30.327 --> 41:35.266
She's in the Doll Hospital,
down the stairs.

41:35.298 --> 41:36.900
That wasn't so bad.

41:36.934 --> 41:39.804
Maybe the giant roach
found a giant turd to chow down on

41:39.836 --> 41:43.074
and forgot all about us.

41:47.744 --> 41:49.713
It's the roach, isn't it?

41:59.155 --> 42:02.159
Oh, fuck my life!

42:02.192 --> 42:06.297
Jane, run!

42:06.329 --> 42:07.664
The fuck!

42:16.840 --> 42:20.811
Come and get it, asshole!

42:20.844 --> 42:23.695
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

42:27.784 --> 42:30.353
No. Find my daughter.

42:30.387 --> 42:33.686
The Doll Hospital. Go.

42:49.507 --> 42:53.409
I was supposed
to be the villain

42:53.443 --> 42:57.648
of this shitty piece.

42:57.681 --> 43:00.784
I was bested by a little girl,

43:00.818 --> 43:04.454
and thrown out of my own
criminal organization

43:04.487 --> 43:08.492
by a rat and a roach.

43:08.525 --> 43:11.327
Me...

43:11.362 --> 43:14.032
The big bad. The black hat.

43:14.065 --> 43:17.835
You can't make this shit up!

43:17.869 --> 43:22.472
Yesterday, a 13-year-old girl told me
to fuck my face with a weed-whacker.

43:24.407 --> 43:27.378
Congratulations.

43:27.411 --> 43:29.480
We both suck.

43:29.512 --> 43:31.181
That's one way
to tell the story.

43:31.215 --> 43:32.516
It's the truth.

43:32.550 --> 43:34.885
It's the past.

43:34.918 --> 43:38.521
The future is still yours
for the making.

43:38.556 --> 43:41.592
Why? What's the point?

43:41.626 --> 43:45.329
I know what it's like
to be a nobody.

43:45.362 --> 43:49.134
But as bad as that felt,
I'd rather be nobody than nothing.

43:49.166 --> 43:51.369
And that is exactly
what you're going to be

43:51.402 --> 43:54.472
if you don't quit
feeling sorry for yourself.

43:54.505 --> 43:55.806
You don't give a shit about me.

43:55.840 --> 43:58.409
You're only saying all of this
to save your own tuchus.

44:00.478 --> 44:03.447
That is... 100% true.

44:03.481 --> 44:05.449
But think about it this way,

44:05.483 --> 44:09.353
if you give up now,
your story is a forgettable,

44:09.385 --> 44:13.291
disappointing defeat,

44:13.324 --> 44:16.628
but if you take up
your narration once again,

44:16.661 --> 44:22.867
you can turn your tale into
something beloved by all,

44:22.867 --> 44:27.304
told and retold
time after time.

44:27.338 --> 44:31.675
A comeback.

<i>No.</i>

44:58.637 --> 45:01.572
<i>Ezekiel realized that
it wasn't God, it couldn't be,</i>

45:01.605 --> 45:04.576
<i>because he was God all along.</i>

<i>Ugh. Three o'clock.

45:36.574 --> 45:40.811
<i>Why, a god would not be sated

45:40.844 --> 45:42.780
<i>Ezekiel had a new appetite.</i>

45:42.813 --> 45:44.782
<i>He desired to eat...</i>

45:44.815 --> 45:46.583
<i>the world.</i>

45:46.617 --> 45:48.219
Yes!

46:03.367 --> 46:07.972
Of all the stupid ways
I expected to die,

46:08.005 --> 46:12.376
getting eaten by a Godzilla-rat
never made the list.

46:12.409 --> 46:15.045
I don't know.
Maybe I deserve this.

46:15.079 --> 46:17.981
I was a shitty dad
and a worse husband.

46:18.014 --> 46:20.050
Uh, let's see, what else?

46:23.320 --> 46:26.891
Okay, yeah. But those two other
things, they aren't that bad.

46:29.827 --> 46:32.362
I mean, lots of people suck at
relationships and parenting.

46:32.396 --> 46:34.798
Doesn't mean
they're sucky people, does it?

46:34.798 --> 46:36.266
Because if I had
another chance with Clara,

46:36.266 --> 46:38.835
I know I'd do so much better.

46:38.869 --> 46:40.739
So, why shouldn't I get
a second chance?

46:40.771 --> 46:44.108
Why do I deserve to be slowly
digested by a giant fucking rodent?

46:44.108 --> 46:47.443
'Cause I don't think I do.
I don't fucking deserve this!

46:47.478 --> 46:48.813
Maybe nobody does.

46:48.846 --> 46:51.282
I do not deserve this shit.

46:51.315 --> 46:54.719
I do not deserve this shit!

46:54.751 --> 46:57.989
I do not deserve this shit!

47:00.291 --> 47:02.527
Okay,
you heard Vic's plan.

47:02.561 --> 47:06.463
You're gonna find us a way
out of here. I know you are.

47:06.496 --> 47:08.331
Negative Spirit, release!

47:39.530 --> 47:41.965
Hello?

47:41.998 --> 47:44.168
I'm Jane.

47:44.202 --> 47:46.871
Niles sent me to come get you.

48:05.623 --> 48:07.023
Good job.

48:07.057 --> 48:09.860
Looks like I'm up.

48:09.894 --> 48:13.262
Just as soon as everyone's
inside the giant cockroach.

48:13.262 --> 48:14.262
Rita!

48:26.277 --> 48:30.581
I know you better than
you know yourself, Ezekiel.

48:30.614 --> 48:35.614
You wanna pick me up in those
strong arms and devour me whole.

48:36.655 --> 48:40.757
Oh, God. This is gonna be worse
than the donkey, isn't it?

48:47.563 --> 48:49.166
I get it.

48:49.199 --> 48:53.250
I have a friend, Baby Doll.

48:54.471 --> 48:56.907
She's like us.

48:56.940 --> 48:59.344
She gets scared too.

48:59.376 --> 49:01.512
And your dad used
to sing her this song

49:01.545 --> 49:05.248
that always
made her feel better.

49:05.282 --> 49:10.282
<i>♪ I'm a valiant
Little squirrel ♪</i>

49:11.255 --> 49:16.255
<i>♪ I am brave and powerful ♪</i>

49:16.561 --> 49:21.264
<i>♪ No, I'm not afraid
Of anything ♪</i>

49:21.298 --> 49:24.168
<i>♪ At all ♪</i>

49:27.170 --> 49:31.208
<i>♪ I am strong ♪</i>

49:31.242 --> 49:35.480
<i>♪ I am daring ♪</i>

49:35.512 --> 49:39.684
<i>♪ It's not me
That you'll be scaring ♪</i>

49:39.717 --> 49:44.717
<i>♪ No, I'm not afraid
Of anything ♪</i>

49:46.090 --> 49:50.626
<i>♪ At all ♪</i>

49:50.661 --> 49:53.931
Not even a hawk?

49:53.963 --> 49:58.764
With its loud
and mighty squawk?

50:02.940 --> 50:04.590
Come, dear.

50:11.016 --> 50:16.016
Shall we go see what the inside
of a cockroach looks like?

50:45.416 --> 50:48.385
Wait, wait, Cliff.
What about Cliff?

50:48.418 --> 50:50.954
<i>Oh, shit. Cliff.</i>

50:50.987 --> 50:54.590
I do not deserve this shit!

50:54.625 --> 50:55.826
Ugh. Gross.

50:55.860 --> 50:57.795
<i>Um, okay.</i>

50:57.827 --> 51:00.097
Okay, I'm just vamping here.

51:00.130 --> 51:01.465
Then...

51:01.498 --> 51:05.998
Then Ezekiel
noticed Whiskers.

51:06.903 --> 51:11.403
I mean, he really noticed him.

51:15.313 --> 51:19.684
Why, he had been so busy

51:19.717 --> 51:22.519
becoming the architect
of the Apocalypse and all,

51:22.554 --> 51:25.699
that he had failed to see
what was right before his eyes,

51:25.699 --> 51:27.159
but there he was.

51:27.159 --> 51:32.563
<i>Ezekiel's right hand in the
destruction of this loathsome world.</i>

51:32.563 --> 51:35.099
<i>Another meek
and forgotten creature.</i>

51:35.132 --> 51:37.434
It was as if a soul
had been split in two,

51:37.467 --> 51:39.936
and they were finding their way
back together again.

51:39.969 --> 51:42.172
<i>The yearning was palpable.</i>

51:42.206 --> 51:44.208
<i>It was intoxicating.</i>

51:48.179 --> 51:51.483
Really? Oh, Whiskers!

51:51.516 --> 51:55.052
<i>It was in that moment
that Ezekiel lost all other appetite,</i>

51:55.085 --> 51:57.855
<i>he hungered for one thing</i>

51:57.887 --> 51:59.923
and one thing only,

51:59.956 --> 52:02.159
and that was...

52:02.193 --> 52:04.143
rat-a-tushie.

52:19.476 --> 52:21.378
Oh! Gotta make it
into the cockroach.

52:21.411 --> 52:23.313
Gotta make it
into the cockroach.

52:23.347 --> 52:25.315
Gotta make it
into the cockroach.

52:25.349 --> 52:27.650
Oh, God! Oh, fuck me!

52:35.025 --> 52:38.130
<i>Now knowing that his greatest
fear was also his greatest power,</i>

52:38.163 --> 52:43.163
<i>Larry knew it was time to rip through
this impenetrable dimension.</i>

52:50.340 --> 52:53.677
All of the pieces
were clicking into place.

52:53.710 --> 52:58.710
The story's riveting end
was finally upon us.

53:01.052 --> 53:04.088
So, the cockroach eats them to
protect them from the radiation,

53:04.121 --> 53:08.925
I get that.
But what happens to us?

53:08.958 --> 53:09.960
Oh, shi...

53:13.396 --> 53:16.099
Miscreants!
Dissenters!

53:16.132 --> 53:18.503
Did they think
they could destroy me?

53:18.536 --> 53:21.907
Nay, the Apocalypse
is my bedfellow.

53:21.940 --> 53:26.244
Nuclear radiation, a mere
gentle kiss upon my back.

53:26.277 --> 53:29.780
I cannot die for I am death!

53:29.813 --> 53:32.516
I am the beginning,
the end, the...

53:44.027 --> 53:45.228
Everybody okay?

53:45.262 --> 53:47.398
Nothing that
an hour-long shower

53:47.431 --> 53:52.431
and a whiskey
on the rocks won't fix.

53:52.670 --> 53:56.172
- Is that...
- Yes.

53:56.206 --> 53:59.806
It's all right, darling.

54:01.711 --> 54:04.014
Everyone...

54:04.047 --> 54:07.784
this is my daughter, Dorothy.

54:07.818 --> 54:09.420
Dorothy Spinner.

54:09.454 --> 54:12.023
Uh, guys...

54:12.056 --> 54:15.726
I'm gonna suggest maybe we deal
with the issue at hand here,

54:15.760 --> 54:17.963
and then meet the world's
most powerful little girl.

54:17.996 --> 54:20.465
What the fuck?
Are you fucking kidding me?

54:20.498 --> 54:22.233
Are you fucking kidding me?

54:22.266 --> 54:25.434
Are you fucking kidding me!
