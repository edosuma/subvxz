<i>[Matt] "I was lucky to get a war."
That's how the old guys saw it.</i>

01:06.258 --> 01:09.175
<i>I'd have the rest of my life
to tell folks how I'd made history.</i>

01:11.133 --> 01:13.342
<i>Well, I signed up July 11, 2001,</i>

01:13.425 --> 01:15.800
<i>two months before
that really meant something.</i>

01:16.925 --> 01:20.300
<i>Oh, I'd love to say,
"I'm here to fight for freedom."</i>

01:20.383 --> 01:23.883
<i>But honestly... I joined the reserves
for the college money.</i>

01:25.050 --> 01:28.342
<i>I don't belong here.
And I'm ashamed of that.</i>

01:36.592 --> 01:40.425
<i>A war story can't be true
unless it's got some shame attached to it.</i>

02:20.967 --> 02:22.633
[Cole] Hey! Ocre!

02:29.217 --> 02:30.342
What do you think?

02:32.300 --> 02:34.008
Pokey was my dog's name.

02:34.092 --> 02:36.258
Mirra loma's the name
of the street I grew up on.

02:36.342 --> 02:37.342
Oh.

02:38.383 --> 02:42.425
It's my porn name.
I'm going balls deep in Iraq, get it?

02:42.508 --> 02:44.008
Yeah, yeah. Clever.

02:44.092 --> 02:46.008
That coming off?

02:46.092 --> 02:49.592
- Yeah. Yeah, headin' that way.
- Just in time. Armored's rollin' out.

02:49.675 --> 02:52.133
This place will be a ghost town.
Ticktock, ticktock. Right?

02:53.925 --> 02:54.925
Right.

02:55.008 --> 02:59.008
Hey, if I don't see you
for the rest of the war, be safe.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.300
You too.

03:06.467 --> 03:07.925
[Saw buzzing]

03:17.342 --> 03:18.425
A little pressure.

03:23.217 --> 03:25.592
Scale of one to ten, how's the pain?

03:25.675 --> 03:27.217
[Stammers] It's a ten.

03:29.383 --> 03:33.133
Whatever the suggested dose, double it.
That'll handle the discomfort.

03:33.217 --> 03:34.925
Discomfort? Nah, I... [scoffs]

03:35.008 --> 03:37.508
I can't even make a fist.
I can't roll out like this.

03:38.508 --> 03:39.925
Let me see your hand.

03:43.883 --> 03:46.258
- A door did that?
- Yeah.

03:47.550 --> 03:49.592
I've seen guys rollin' out
with a lot worse.

03:56.508 --> 03:57.943
<i>[Newscaster]
Here's one of the potential targets.</i>

03:57.967 --> 03:59.443
<i>When you're in Baghdad,
it's really quite...</i>

03:59.467 --> 04:00.717
That a boy, Enzo.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.675
- [Enzo groaning]
- Get it!

04:03.592 --> 04:04.592
[Grunts]

04:06.425 --> 04:07.883
[Groaning]

04:07.967 --> 04:11.133
<i>I'm telling you guys,
I'm gonna be on the cover of men's health,</i>

04:11.217 --> 04:13.508
fuckin' two big-old-tittied chicks
on each arm,

04:13.592 --> 04:15.842
waves splashing on my pecs and shit.

04:15.925 --> 04:18.966
<i>Chutsky, we're gonna see you
on the cover of out magazine</i>

04:19.050 --> 04:22.800
with a dick in each hand
and shame in your eyes. Like this.

04:22.883 --> 04:24.217
[Enzo moans]

04:24.300 --> 04:25.717
Hey, you smell that?

04:25.800 --> 04:28.467
- [Sniffs] Smells like pussy.
- Why would it smell like pussy?

04:28.550 --> 04:30.133
Oh, hey, ocre.

04:30.217 --> 04:32.026
[Enzo] What's up?
We were just talking about you.

04:32.050 --> 04:33.675
[Chutsky] You look like shit.

04:33.758 --> 04:35.401
That malaria pill is giving me nightmares.

04:35.425 --> 04:36.901
[Enzo] This whole place
is a nightmare, man.

04:36.925 --> 04:39.758
So... what'd the doc say?

04:40.842 --> 04:41.967
Yeah. I'm good.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.842
[Burton] Welcome back.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.092
- Did you see armored's rolling out?
- Come again?

04:48.175 --> 04:49.925
Whoa! Is that true?

04:50.008 --> 04:52.092
Yeah. And I saw Cole loading the Abrams.

04:52.675 --> 04:54.717
Sergeant Harper, are we staging?

04:54.800 --> 04:55.984
I know what you know, chutsky.

04:56.008 --> 04:57.768
Come on. What do I know?
Tell me what I know.

04:57.842 --> 04:59.734
Hey, sarge, if we are staging,
we should start moving.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.967
Guys, command will let us know
when they're ready.

05:02.050 --> 05:04.842
Army's kept me in a cage for six weeks,
sergeant Harper.

05:04.925 --> 05:07.842
Ooh, time to let me out. [Growls]

05:07.925 --> 05:09.175
So how's the hand feel?

05:11.675 --> 05:13.258
- It's not a problem.
- Okay.

05:28.467 --> 05:29.550
Get the stick, huh?

05:37.758 --> 05:38.925
What are you doing here?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.675
Uh, whatever you tell me to, sergeant.

05:43.758 --> 05:47.133
That's a very good answer.
But that's not what I mean. [Grunts]

05:47.217 --> 05:48.383
You're a smart guy.

05:49.467 --> 05:51.133
Smarter than most of these boys.

05:51.217 --> 05:53.800
Why aren't you being all the fuck
you can be somewhere else, huh?

05:53.883 --> 05:56.675
Well, uh, it was laundry day
when I signed up.

05:57.258 --> 05:58.698
[Straining] Needed the free t-shirt.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.050
Come on, ocre.

06:05.967 --> 06:08.008
I don't know.
My dad was in, my granddad.

06:08.092 --> 06:09.383
Something you did, you know?

06:11.050 --> 06:14.133
[Macgregor] Glorious day for the infantry,
sergeant Harper.

06:14.217 --> 06:15.258
As you were.

06:16.342 --> 06:19.842
Hooah, sergeant major.
Which way is the shit rolling, lieutenant?

06:19.925 --> 06:21.967
Downhill, as always.

06:22.050 --> 06:23.693
[Macgregor] Just as gravity intended, son.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.675
We're being moved up the manifest.

06:25.758 --> 06:28.467
Chalk two packs as slow
as my fuckin' wife, apparently.

06:28.550 --> 06:31.675
Roger that, sir. We're gonna be
about an hour till we're square here.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.300
Well, better make it 30.

06:35.092 --> 06:36.133
You boys proud and ready?

06:36.217 --> 06:38.842
Proud and ready, sergeant major.
Proud and ready.

06:40.467 --> 06:44.633
Yeah, you got that right.
Beautiful goddamn day for the infantry.

06:58.258 --> 07:00.258
[Chutsky] Burton? There's no way.
Not this guy.

07:00.342 --> 07:02.484
- [Enzo] All day. Burton.
- This little... this little...

07:02.508 --> 07:05.758
Little baby-faced, wet-nosed puppy dog,
care bear motherfucker right here?

07:05.842 --> 07:09.342
[Enzo] Yeah, I'm outside. I don't know
none of this shit's going on, right?

07:09.425 --> 07:12.592
So I'm looking up, and I swear to god,
just as the first fireworks went off,

07:12.675 --> 07:14.717
Mitch comes flying through the front door,

07:14.800 --> 07:17.258
face bloodied, mangled,
just all messed up.

07:17.342 --> 07:20.300
And then out of the corner of my eye,
I see this white flash comin'.

07:20.383 --> 07:21.425
I look over.

07:21.508 --> 07:24.925
It's Burton taking a running leap
off my front porch.

07:25.008 --> 07:27.675
Came down on him
with the knee, like this. Boom!

07:27.758 --> 07:31.050
He grabs him by the ponytail,
drags him to the middle of the street

07:31.133 --> 07:33.467
and beat the brakes
off of this grown man.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.800
I mean, he hit him with shit
I ain't never seen before.

07:35.883 --> 07:38.258
- What, and everyone just watched?
- Yeah.

07:39.342 --> 07:41.008
- [Enzo chuckles]
- Damn, Burton.

07:41.092 --> 07:44.425
Bottom line, his mom
took care of me when I was a kid.

07:44.508 --> 07:45.508
Yeah.

07:45.592 --> 07:48.800
This guy was a piece of shit.
He got what was coming to him.

07:48.883 --> 07:50.050
- That's it.
- [Enzo chuckles]

07:50.133 --> 07:53.175
You need, like...
Like, anger management for that.

07:53.258 --> 07:55.050
No, I'm good. [Exhales heavily]

07:55.133 --> 07:56.901
<i>[Officer on radio] You're clear
to cross phase line, Alpha.</i>

07:56.925 --> 07:58.258
Well, I got really into pilates.

07:58.342 --> 08:01.175
Roger that, noble lion.
We are ready to go. Over.

08:01.258 --> 08:03.092
[Engines starting]

08:03.175 --> 08:05.467
Guys, game on.
Let's go. Come on.

08:06.217 --> 08:08.008
Baghdad or bust, bitches.

08:18.842 --> 08:20.258
Cigarette?

08:20.342 --> 08:22.217
No, I'm good, thanks.
Don't smoke.

08:23.883 --> 08:26.008
- Keep me safe up there.
- You know it.

08:26.092 --> 08:28.592
<i>[Macgregor] Yeah, let's get it up!</i>

08:28.675 --> 08:31.633
<i>- [Both exclaim]
- Gonna ask you boys to get to your war.</i>

08:32.799 --> 08:34.383
<i>Whoever built that berm,</i>

08:34.467 --> 08:37.674
<i>if they ain't scared,
they're gonna get scared.</i>

08:37.758 --> 08:39.674
<i>Double time!</i>

08:40.383 --> 08:41.924
<i>March!</i>

08:57.300 --> 08:58.592
[Bullet whirring]

08:58.675 --> 09:01.300
[Chuckling] Shit.

09:01.383 --> 09:03.425
- [Enzo] That fuckin' sucks.
- Yeah, no shit.

09:03.508 --> 09:06.008
All right.
Well, you're gonna have to flank.

09:06.092 --> 09:09.217
All right. Well, Charlie team's got a...
A team across the way.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.508
Maybe I could flank with them.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.425
Oh, chutsky, you want it?
Go get it, boy.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.508
- Hey, Burton.
- Yeah?

09:13.592 --> 09:15.258
[Chutsky] Give me some smoke!

09:15.342 --> 09:17.425
Hey, hey, hey,
but don't bum-rush the guy, okay?

09:17.508 --> 09:19.300
Command does not want us
destroying a mosque.

09:19.383 --> 09:20.734
- It's gonna be a bad PR problem.
- Fuckin' liberals.

09:20.758 --> 09:23.842
I don't think it's coming from the mosque.
I saw muzzle flashes behind it.

09:23.925 --> 09:25.842
- What building?
- [Panting]

09:26.758 --> 09:28.133
[Bullets whirring]

09:28.217 --> 09:30.258
I, uh... I think he's in the hotel.

09:30.342 --> 09:32.258
Hotel. I'm gonna take the kid.

09:32.342 --> 09:33.943
- [Harper] All right, ocre.
- Hey, Burton!

09:33.967 --> 09:36.526
- [Harper] Go on, point it out!
- Rockin' and rollin'. You ready?

09:36.550 --> 09:39.758
- Let's go. Follow me, ocre!
- [Matt] Moving.

09:39.842 --> 09:41.425
[Chutsky] Oh! Shit!

09:43.133 --> 09:45.842
Fuck! Shit. Fuck me!

09:48.133 --> 09:49.675
[Gunfire continues]

09:49.758 --> 09:51.842
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

09:53.300 --> 09:55.175
[Kidwell] All right, all right!

09:55.258 --> 09:56.967
Where's the co?

09:57.050 --> 09:58.526
- Co!
- [Chutsky] Right here, sergeant!

09:58.550 --> 10:00.133
[Kidwell] Co! Get over here!

10:00.217 --> 10:02.568
[Chutsky] All right, private here knows
where the fire's coming from.

10:02.592 --> 10:04.443
- [Kidwell] Where's it coming from?
- He's thinking the hotel.

10:04.467 --> 10:05.967
[Matt panting] He's in the hotel.

10:07.425 --> 10:10.217
[Kidwell] Alpha, follow him.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.550
Bravo, with me.
All right, on me!

10:13.633 --> 10:14.633
[Chutsky] Ocre!

10:16.175 --> 10:17.425
[Soldier] You got it.

10:18.592 --> 10:19.592
Move.

10:23.008 --> 10:24.008
Move.

10:29.383 --> 10:30.383
Set.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.008
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move!

11:00.425 --> 11:02.800
- [Muffled gunshot]
- Ah! [Groaning]

11:02.883 --> 11:05.300
[Chutsky] Contact! Contact!
Southeast building.

11:05.383 --> 11:07.800
Ocre, cover fire!
Out the window.

11:07.883 --> 11:09.526
- [Gunfire]
- Guys, get the fuck up the stairs!

11:09.550 --> 11:11.925
All right. Ocre, cover fire.

11:12.008 --> 11:13.842
I got ya. I got ya.
Oh, you're good.

11:13.925 --> 11:16.508
- [Soldier grunts]
- You're good. You're good.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.800
Just quit your bellyaching. You're fine.
Just a little gun wound.

11:19.883 --> 11:22.592
All right, help me out here.
Help me out. God damn.

11:22.675 --> 11:24.151
- [Matt] He okay?
- Fuckin' do something.

11:24.175 --> 11:25.592
Yeah, we're fine. We're fine.

11:25.675 --> 11:27.315
- All right, ocre, you're with me.
- Yeah.

11:27.342 --> 11:28.758
You, follow me.

11:28.842 --> 11:30.342
[Soldier groaning]

11:38.717 --> 11:39.717
[Bullet whirring]

11:40.425 --> 11:41.800
[Chutsky] Whoo! Ah.

11:41.883 --> 11:43.592
[Chuckles] Call it in.

11:44.758 --> 11:46.217
[Breathing heavily]

11:46.300 --> 11:48.925
Noble lion, this is eagle one.
Do you copy?

11:49.925 --> 11:51.485
<i>[Officer on radio] Go ahead, eagle one.</i>

11:53.425 --> 11:57.300
Sniper fire is not coming from the mosque.
I repeat, not the mosque.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.342
It is confirmed from the hotel.

11:59.425 --> 12:02.842
It is, uh, 260 degrees and...

12:02.925 --> 12:04.609
What is it, about 100 meters
from the mosque?

12:04.633 --> 12:06.050
Hundred and fifty.

12:06.133 --> 12:09.175
And 150 meters from the mosque. Over.

12:12.300 --> 12:15.008
<i>Do you have a floor number,
eagle one? Over.</i>

12:16.550 --> 12:19.717
Wait, one...
Yo, they want a fucking floor number.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.425
Floor number?
Do they want a room number, too?

12:23.508 --> 12:25.342
Is this motherfucker
ordering room service?

12:25.425 --> 12:26.508
[Matt breathing heavily]

12:27.550 --> 12:30.300
Get the fuck up top.
Get 'em a fuckin' floor number.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.675
[Grunting] God damn.

12:34.550 --> 12:36.300
- And watch your head.
- Yeah.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.800
[Gunfire]

12:40.467 --> 12:42.842
[Chutsky] Shit. Whoo!

12:42.925 --> 12:44.300
[Laughs]

12:46.925 --> 12:50.092
Yeah. Third floor, southeast corner.

12:50.883 --> 12:53.175
- You say third floor, southeast corner?
- Yeah.

12:53.258 --> 12:54.258
Fuck.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.258
[Bullets whirring]

12:57.342 --> 12:58.675
Fuck that!

13:00.550 --> 13:03.092
Noble lion, this is eagle two.
[Panting]

13:03.175 --> 13:04.717
Sniper fire is too heavy.

13:06.092 --> 13:08.300
I'm suggesting an air strike. Over.

13:10.467 --> 13:12.526
- What the hell are you doing?
- What a clusterfuck of a...

13:12.550 --> 13:13.758
Chutsky?

13:13.842 --> 13:17.092
- [Sighs] It's just such a clusterfuck.
- Hey. No, no, no, chutsky.

13:17.175 --> 13:18.943
This whole thing
is such a fucking clusterfuck.

13:18.967 --> 13:22.383
No. No, no, no. Sergeant...
Hey, sergeant, we're too close.

13:22.467 --> 13:25.383
We're not too close.
We're right where we need to be.

13:25.467 --> 13:28.758
Sergeant, how long do we have?
Can I move? Do we have time to move?

13:28.842 --> 13:32.550
No, we don't have time to fuckin' move.
We called in an air strike. Stay put.

13:32.633 --> 13:33.717
[Straining] Okay. Hang on.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.258
[Chutsky mutters] I mean,
we're sitting here all day.

13:36.342 --> 13:38.300
It's hot as shit.
My balls are sweating.

13:38.383 --> 13:40.800
Fuckin' salt stains
under my arm and shit.

13:40.883 --> 13:42.592
- [Helicopter approaching]
- Oh, yeah.

13:46.592 --> 13:48.967
Keep your head down.
We've got fuckin' backup.

13:49.050 --> 13:51.467
- [Helicopter blades whirring]
- [Grunts]

13:54.758 --> 13:55.967
[Chutsky] Boom!

14:01.008 --> 14:02.592
[Indistinct]

14:03.758 --> 14:06.092
You lose, motherfucker!

14:07.383 --> 14:11.217
Oh, fuck. That's why I'm in Baghdad.
That's why I'm in fucking Baghdad!

14:12.550 --> 14:15.592
- Ocre! You deaf?
- What?

14:15.675 --> 14:18.258
Ocre! You about to puke?

14:18.342 --> 14:19.342
[Softly] I'm good.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.133
Whoo! We fuckin' did it, sir.

14:27.217 --> 14:28.901
<i>[Chutsky] That was the most American shit
I've ever seen.</i>

14:28.925 --> 14:31.401
Yeah, come on out, chutsky. Walk out now.
We're coming from the north.

14:31.425 --> 14:32.883
[Enzo chuckles]

14:32.967 --> 14:35.550
Ready them titties, Kansas City.

14:35.633 --> 14:38.342
Corporal Enzo, hero, will be home soon.

14:38.425 --> 14:40.508
Okay, right here.
Right here. Right here.

14:40.592 --> 14:42.092
[Enzo] Oh, I'm a bad man.

14:42.175 --> 14:43.901
- Let's go. Dismount.
- Yo, I'mma get all kinds of titties.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.800
Big titties, little titties,
fuckin' medium titties.

14:46.883 --> 14:52.217
Oh, shit. I'll be straight up, man.
Back home I was fucking threes, fours.

14:52.300 --> 14:55.508
After a story like this,
I'm definitely fucking fives, sixes,

14:55.592 --> 14:57.758
maybe even a seven
if I catch me a drunk patriot.

14:57.842 --> 14:59.008
[Grunting and exclaiming]

14:59.092 --> 15:00.818
- What's the sitrep, sergeant?
- [Enzo grunts]

15:00.842 --> 15:02.425
Uh, we've got a wia on the roof.

15:02.508 --> 15:05.342
Uh, Charlie team three's
medevaccing him right now.

15:05.425 --> 15:06.625
Ocre and I blew up a building.

15:06.675 --> 15:08.193
[Chuckles] Yeah, you did.
All right, good job.

15:08.217 --> 15:09.258
Good job, private ocre.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.633
Yeah, he can't hear you.

15:10.717 --> 15:12.383
- Ocre!
- [Matt] Huh?

15:12.467 --> 15:13.467
Come here.

15:15.675 --> 15:17.300
How you feel?

15:17.383 --> 15:19.008
Underpaid.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.612
All right. I'll be sure to pass
your complaint on to management.

15:21.675 --> 15:22.717
Come on.

15:33.883 --> 15:36.300
Hey, don't let these little mini-jihadists
get too close.

15:36.383 --> 15:39.258
Fuckin' little bombs
strapped all over 'em and shit.

15:39.342 --> 15:41.258

Wait, wait, wait.

Hey, knock that shit off.
Come on.

[Burton] Get the fuck outta here, bro!

16:34.467 --> 16:37.776
[Enzo] Does anybody fuckin' knock anymore?
I'm trying to have a moment, motherfucker!

16:37.800 --> 16:40.175
[Chutsky] Hey!
Hey, I found Saddam's porn stash.

16:40.258 --> 16:43.300

Saddam's 'stache.

18:03.842 --> 18:06.800
Burton! Do you remember Steph bertolini?
With all the ass?

18:06.883 --> 18:09.092
Oh, the, uh... that chick with polio?

18:09.175 --> 18:11.776
She did not have fuckin' polio!
How many times we gotta go over this shit?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.609
It was, like, a leg thing or, like,
she had, like, a baby foot or something...

18:14.633 --> 18:16.433
Oh, my god, it...
It couldn't have been polio,

18:16.508 --> 18:19.276
- 'cause they cured that in fuckin' 1957.
- [Chutsky] And why do you know that?

18:19.300 --> 18:21.383
Because, asshole, I looked it up.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.800
Yeah, you looked it up 'cause
you thought your girl had polio, so...

18:24.883 --> 18:26.234
- Well, fuck you very much.
- Here. Here. Here.

18:26.258 --> 18:28.151
You know what? I'm hitting
every pothole and every fuckin'...

One, two, three.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.842

- All right.

[Enzo] Y'all fuckin' around
with my taste in women and shit.

19:04.092 --> 19:06.717
- All right, hop in, hopscotch.
- No, I'm not going in the back.

19:06.800 --> 19:07.800
Get the fuck in the car.

19:07.883 --> 19:09.151
I'm the biggest.
That doesn't make sense.

19:09.175 --> 19:11.008
Sergeant, private.
Get in the fucking back.

19:11.092 --> 19:13.092
[Enzo] Oh, he pulled rank on your ass!

19:14.050 --> 19:16.970
- [Chutsky] You're gonna love it.
- [Enzo] You got no jokes now, huh, boy?

19:18.175 --> 19:20.092
[Chutsky] All right. You can touch him.

19:20.175 --> 19:22.217
- Just keep below the waist.
- Yeah, great.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.151
- [Enzo] He's gonna touch his hajji peepee.
- [Sighs]

19:24.175 --> 19:26.425
[Chutsky] Oh, Enzo, yo,
came up with a nickname.

19:27.675 --> 19:30.175
[Enzo] You can't come up
with your own nickname, man.

19:30.258 --> 19:32.758
That shit's gay. Nobody's gonna
fuckin' call you by it but you.

19:32.842 --> 19:34.342
[Chutsky] Boss murderer.

19:34.425 --> 19:35.901
- [Enzo] Okay, so that's badass.
- [Chutsky] Yeah?

19:35.925 --> 19:37.193
- That is badass.
- That's why I said it.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.592
[Enzo] I'mma give you that one.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.717
Shit. Hey! Hey, guys!
Guys, he just moved!

19:44.383 --> 19:47.175
Hey! Hey! Hey, he's not dead!

19:47.258 --> 19:48.484
[Enzo] What the fuck is going down?

19:48.508 --> 19:50.151
- Hold up!
- Open up! He moved! He's not dead!

19:50.175 --> 19:52.383
Calm the fuck down.
What are you talking about?

19:52.467 --> 19:54.675
- He's fucking movin'.
- What the fuck?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.675
What the hell you talking about?

19:56.758 --> 19:57.800
- Oh, shit!
- See?

19:57.883 --> 20:00.425
- Hey! Whoa! Are you crazy?
- What the fuck?

20:00.508 --> 20:03.258
Will you put the gun down?
It's 113 degrees, all right?

20:03.342 --> 20:05.609
He's thawing out. That's why
he's jumping around like a catfish.

20:05.633 --> 20:07.568
- You sure?
- Will you chill out? Put that shit away.

20:07.592 --> 20:09.092
[Laughing]

20:09.175 --> 20:12.383
This shit ain't funny, Burton, man!
I almost had a fuckin' heart attack!

20:12.467 --> 20:14.092
Mission came down.

20:14.175 --> 20:18.550
0200 this morning,
an apache spotted a weapons exchange.

20:18.633 --> 20:21.508
Unleashed hell
on a truck filled with rpgs.

20:21.592 --> 20:23.050
Hey, whereabouts are we talking?

20:23.758 --> 20:26.717
Small village up north.
Outskirts of baqubah.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.508
I mean, a Toyota
filled with dead terrorists...

20:29.592 --> 20:31.068
Doesn't seem like a big problem, sir.

20:31.092 --> 20:34.133
No, the big problem is the big fucking
hole we left in their water station

20:34.217 --> 20:35.592
when the apaches fired on them.

20:37.092 --> 20:41.425
Command wants some of our guys
to attach to the sf team on the ground.

20:43.217 --> 20:46.050
You'll report to a captain syverson
and run water to the town.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.943
- What do you mean? Like delivery boys?
- That, and we're giving you some capital

20:49.967 --> 20:52.883
to get the locals working with
the engineers on the pumping station.

20:52.967 --> 20:55.800
Look, lieutenant, everybody's
been talking about going home.

20:55.883 --> 21:01.050
And now you want us to go to some place
we don't control. For what? A photo op?

21:01.175 --> 21:02.550
Yeah.

21:11.925 --> 21:13.133
[Chuckles] Christ.

21:14.050 --> 21:16.133
You look like you went swimming.

21:16.217 --> 21:20.175
- There was no ventilation back there.
- Oh, that's why I ride up top.

21:20.258 --> 21:22.883
I see more of the country
than anyone else.

21:22.967 --> 21:25.175
Nah. Nah, you couldn't pay me enough
to ride the turret.

21:25.258 --> 21:27.342
We hit shit, all the fire's
coming your way, buddy.

21:28.342 --> 21:31.175
Yeah, that's true. [Chuckles]

21:31.258 --> 21:36.550
But when we get home,
I'll remember the breeze, sunshine.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.175
Like you'll remember sitting in the dark,
sweating your ass off.

21:53.675 --> 21:56.508
[Enzo] Are we just fucking allergic
to good news or what?

21:58.092 --> 21:59.133
[Stammers]

21:59.217 --> 22:01.633
Special forces?
We don't do that shit.

22:01.717 --> 22:03.008
That's true.

22:03.092 --> 22:06.467
Look, guys, I don't want anybody
who's not fully on board. Okay?

22:06.550 --> 22:08.984
You don't want in, you let me know,
and I'll get you replaced.

22:09.008 --> 22:11.168
Oh, I think you should take
the tampon out of your ass.

22:11.217 --> 22:14.300
All right? I'm tired
of this whole green zone shit.

22:14.383 --> 22:15.383
I'm in.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.175
[Enzo scoffs] I fuckin' knew it.

22:18.508 --> 22:22.217
Hey. You go, I go.
You want that on your conscience?

22:23.217 --> 22:26.217
Are you a grown man?
Then make your own decisions.

22:29.008 --> 22:30.300
[Enzo sighs]

22:32.217 --> 22:34.057
Can we at least get
the sat phone to call home?

22:34.092 --> 22:36.133
Yeah. Yeah, I'll make it happen.

22:44.842 --> 22:47.050
[Music playing on headphones]

23:01.300 --> 23:02.717
[Matt] Hey, sergeant, you done?

23:02.800 --> 23:06.342
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
I was just calling my fiancée.

23:07.592 --> 23:08.925
Well, how is she doing?

23:09.592 --> 23:11.425
I got the... the answering machine.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.133
You tell her much about Iraq?

23:15.717 --> 23:18.925
Only the stuff that won't worry her.
I figure what's the point, right?

23:19.008 --> 23:20.258
Yeah.

23:20.342 --> 23:22.300
I mean, my mom thinks
I work in the kitchen.

23:23.217 --> 23:24.467
I told her... [chuckles]

23:24.550 --> 23:27.258
It's stupid. I told her everyone
calls me private okra.

23:27.925 --> 23:29.425
[Chuckles]

23:29.508 --> 23:33.383
Okay. But your dad, right? He was in.
You could talk to him. He gets it.

23:34.467 --> 23:36.175
He went awol when I was six.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.842
That burn you up?

23:39.675 --> 23:41.717
No. No, I was too young.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.008
All I remember is, uh, the day he left...

23:45.133 --> 23:48.925
He told me he was going to get a coke,
and then just never came back. [Chuckles]

23:51.675 --> 23:54.133
So now I only drink Pepsi out of spite.
[Sighs]

23:59.008 --> 24:00.258
What's on your mind, ocre?

24:01.592 --> 24:05.050
I was just, uh, thinking
about this place they're sending us.

24:05.133 --> 24:07.050
- Baqubah.
- Yeah.

24:09.300 --> 24:12.467
You know, these small towns,
we don't control them.

24:13.133 --> 24:16.550
Yeah, it's not all yahtzee
and flip-flops like it is here.

24:17.592 --> 24:19.717
And... you know,
we destroyed their water supply,

24:19.800 --> 24:21.400
so they're not gonna be happy to see us.

24:21.467 --> 24:24.550
Yeah, but they will be
when we get that water flowing again.

24:24.633 --> 24:26.133
Right. Right.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.550
I just think that there's a chance
we're walking into something bigger.

24:31.633 --> 24:33.258
I don't think I'm cut out for that shit.

24:35.050 --> 24:38.425
Burton's tough as nails, and chutsky
isn't afraid of anything. I... I'm...

24:38.508 --> 24:41.008
Look, chutsky sees a fire,
he sticks his hand in it.

24:41.092 --> 24:44.133
I need somebody smart,
somebody who sees the bigger picture.

24:52.883 --> 24:54.383
And if I don't go?

24:58.300 --> 25:00.842
If you don't go,
then I was wrong about you.

25:00.925 --> 25:03.675
And I don't want anybody I was wrong about
watching my back.

25:05.717 --> 25:09.592
It's up to you. You can't come out here
and outsource your decision to me.

25:15.133 --> 25:19.550
If you're in, here's the sat phone.
You got a call to make.

25:30.175 --> 25:32.234
You ain't gotta look good.
Just gotta do good, right?

25:32.258 --> 25:34.758
[Chutsky] Shit. Looking good's
the most important part.

25:36.050 --> 25:37.300
He's strange.

25:39.592 --> 25:41.068
Okay, where the fuck
are your plates, private?

25:41.092 --> 25:45.050
- There's not enough to go around.
- But... somebody cough up a plate.

25:45.133 --> 25:46.133
Here, take one of mine.

25:46.217 --> 25:51.050
No, Burton, you're top gun.
That's not... fuck. Chutsky.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.453
- Hey, sergeant, I'm good...
- Just shut the fuck up, ocre.

25:55.175 --> 25:56.967
So you gotta ask yourself,

25:57.050 --> 25:59.842
"am I more likely to get shot
in the chest or the back?"

26:01.550 --> 26:02.633
Choose wisely.

26:12.258 --> 26:14.925
[Harper] Okay, kit up.
Downstairs in 20 minutes.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.651

26:47.008 --> 26:48.967
<i>Salaam. Sergeant Harper.</i>

so maintain convoy integrity.

26:53.258 --> 26:54.800
- Roger that.
- No vehicles in or out.

26:55.425 --> 26:58.758
Money in the back.
And that's it. Load it up!

26:59.758 --> 27:00.758
Get on it.

27:01.675 --> 27:04.467
Oh. Enjoy syverson. He's a blast.

27:08.175 --> 27:09.842
[Chutsky] Holy shit!

27:10.758 --> 27:12.092
All right, look.

27:12.175 --> 27:14.508
Hide this up your asshole,
I will split it with you.

27:14.592 --> 27:17.883
Y'all wanna maintain 10 to 15 meters
at all times. Thank you.

27:17.967 --> 27:19.467
Enzo! Mount up.

27:22.508 --> 27:25.592
Dad's coming. Missed out
on the fucking money, ocre.

28:35.675 --> 28:38.217
Hey, sy. Convoy's pulled up.

28:42.550 --> 28:43.883
Give me a moment, gentlemen.

28:52.550 --> 28:55.342
- Hey. Get that water flowing.
- [Harper] What?

28:55.425 --> 28:56.883
Get that water flowing.

28:59.008 --> 29:02.842
I say get back!
Get back! Let's go! Let's go!

29:02.925 --> 29:03.925
Get back!

29:05.300 --> 29:09.092
Burton, get those fuckers off that truck!
Chutsky, come on!

29:09.175 --> 29:11.425

29:27.217 --> 29:29.425
Let this kid through.
Let this woman through.

29:29.508 --> 29:32.008
Women and children first! Stay back!

29:34.092 --> 29:36.050

[Clamoring]

30:00.133 --> 30:02.175
All right, guys, your job is real simple.

30:02.258 --> 30:05.133
You keep that water flowing,
win their hearts and minds,

30:05.217 --> 30:06.609
and then the Iraqis start pointing fingers

30:06.633 --> 30:08.473
and giving me and the boys
some targets to hit.

30:08.508 --> 30:09.717
[Machmoud] Captain.

30:11.133 --> 30:12.717
- Machmoud.
- You got my 20?

[Chuckles]

30:13.967 --> 30:15.383
This is machmoud.

30:15.467 --> 30:18.175
These boys are gonna fix
your water problem.

30:20.342 --> 30:21.883
Are there more?

30:21.967 --> 30:23.300
Yeah, isn't that a Daisy?

30:24.800 --> 30:26.383
Go on. Get.

30:26.467 --> 30:29.217
But I want my 20, okay?
Dollars, not dinars.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.383
How about I pay you
in freedom and democracy?

30:31.925 --> 30:33.092
[Laughs]

30:34.133 --> 30:36.883
Taught that guy Texas hold'em.
Do not play him.

30:36.967 --> 30:39.258
Turns out he's a goddamn prodigy.
Come on.

[Rock music playing on speakers]

30:55.550 --> 30:56.842
This one's me.

30:56.925 --> 30:59.300
Have you guys had much contact
with the tribal leader?

30:59.383 --> 31:02.425
Sheikh's a waste of time.
You ladies are in here.

31:14.133 --> 31:17.925
Make no mistake, no one
outside that gate wants you here.

31:18.550 --> 31:20.675
So you do your job
and turn those roars to a whisper.

31:22.008 --> 31:23.300
At night, we go dark.

31:23.383 --> 31:27.467
Snipers so much as see a bit of light,
they will start popping shots.

31:31.633 --> 31:32.758
Lovely.

31:32.842 --> 31:34.550
Who wants the bunk by the window?

31:35.467 --> 31:37.967
Ocre. You're up top.

31:45.925 --> 31:47.217

Any questions?

No, sir.

[Metal clanging]

34:56.300 --> 34:58.675
[Harper sighs] What the fuck, sergeant?

34:58.758 --> 35:00.401
Command said it's gonna take
a couple of days.

35:00.425 --> 35:01.943
[Robinson scoffs]
Command says lots of things,

35:01.967 --> 35:03.068
but I'm standing here telling you

35:03.092 --> 35:04.972
two weeks for electrical
and four for the pipes.

35:07.675 --> 35:08.883
[Harper] Jesus.

35:08.967 --> 35:12.425
I got 12 guys working in shifts.
Half on guard duty, half on the pump.

35:13.342 --> 35:15.222
We have to clear the debris
before we can assess

35:15.300 --> 35:17.133
the extent of the damage to the pipes.

35:17.217 --> 35:19.008
You wanna go faster, roll up your sleeves.

35:19.092 --> 35:22.300
Yeah, well, we're only here
to distribute the water, so...

35:22.383 --> 35:23.967
But, hey, I got good news.

35:24.050 --> 35:26.568
We're gonna get you some workers,
and we're gonna speed this up.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.008
You got more guys on the way?

35:28.092 --> 35:30.217
Yeah, we'll get some Iraqis.
We got cash to spend.

35:30.842 --> 35:33.050
- That's the plan?
- That's the plan.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.508
- Pay Iraqis to work?
- Yeah.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.842
You got a better plan, sergeant?

35:39.050 --> 35:41.967
You get me a couple dozen,
it might cut your time in half.

35:42.050 --> 35:44.175
- Good. Done.
- [Chutsky] Turn it up!

35:44.258 --> 35:45.800
No, all the way up!

35:46.550 --> 35:48.467
It's taking forever.

35:48.550 --> 35:50.675
That's as good as it gets.

35:50.758 --> 35:54.050
Well, can't you engineer,
brain something up to make it go faster?

35:54.133 --> 35:55.383
No.

35:55.467 --> 35:58.883
All right, so hour each way.
How long does it take to fill this thing?

35:58.967 --> 36:00.592
[Robinson] I'd say 45, give or take.

36:00.675 --> 36:02.008
Three hours a trip.

36:02.092 --> 36:03.467
Plus distribution time.

36:03.550 --> 36:06.133
But the Iraqis line up fast.
Should get their water fast.

36:06.217 --> 36:08.925
Okay, so four hours and three trips a day.

36:09.008 --> 36:11.300
I mean, we're still gonna be
pushing sunset to be safe.

36:29.967 --> 36:32.175
We got a pickup truck, six o'clock!

36:37.175 --> 36:39.758
Okay, Enzo, Burton, I don't want
this guy getting in my convoy.

get out the fuckin' vehicle,

37:39.925 --> 37:42.508
- it means get out the fuckin' vehicle.
- I got stuck, sergeant.

37:42.592 --> 37:45.112

Uh, they didn't show, but...
But I'm working on it.

In fact, the captain and I
have a meeting with the sheikh later.

to figure out this system.

he will pay with his life.

[Chutsky] Yeah. But, we, uh...
We get the Iraqis' money, right?

You don't do this shit for free.

If it can't form, it can't be fertile.

50:28.133 --> 50:31.383
Even before you guys came here,
sunni farmers in the north

50:31.467 --> 50:34.550
would steal the water
from the shiites in baqubah.

50:34.633 --> 50:36.633
How'd you stop it from happening?

50:36.717 --> 50:39.484
- We don't. It's not about the water.
- [Harper] Chutsky! It's full. Let's go.

50:39.508 --> 50:40.651
It's the sunnis and the shiites.

50:40.675 --> 50:43.050
They will always find
an excuse to kill each other.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.883

56:17.967 --> 56:18.967
Fuck!

56:19.050 --> 56:21.300
- Get moving!
- You got him?

56:21.383 --> 56:24.133
- Not yet. There's at least two up there.
- Okay.

56:25.217 --> 56:27.467
- Ready to rock? Let's light 'em up.
- Yeah.

56:29.508 --> 56:31.467
- Keep his head down!
- Yeah.

56:32.550 --> 56:34.217
Fuck! Chutsky, wait!

56:37.342 --> 56:38.383
Chutsky!

56:40.508 --> 56:41.800
Chutsky!

56:44.467 --> 56:46.175
Hey! Hey, chutsky, you okay?

57:02.633 --> 57:04.925
Guys, chutsky...
Chutsky's down, guys!

57:33.425 --> 57:36.425
You think, um...
You think his family knows yet?

57:49.258 --> 57:51.092
I ain't running that dirt road again.

57:53.300 --> 57:55.300
That thing is death on a fucking stick.

57:57.050 --> 57:58.425
Tell me I'm wrong.

58:01.675 --> 58:03.050
We're making progress.

58:03.675 --> 58:05.508
[Enzo] At a goddamn snail's pace,
sergeant.

58:08.092 --> 58:09.092
Tell him, Burton.

58:10.842 --> 58:12.467
Tell him what you said to me.

58:14.300 --> 58:15.425
Forget it.

58:15.508 --> 58:16.859
Speak the fuck up
and tell him what you said to me.

58:16.883 --> 58:19.217
- Please, man. Come on!
- [Harper] Go on, sergeant.

58:19.300 --> 58:21.050
It's okay. Speak freely.

58:26.925 --> 58:30.300
That we have a job to do and we'll do it.

58:31.383 --> 58:34.758
But if we stay on this course,
we'll get picked off one by one.

58:35.675 --> 58:37.842
[Enzo] So I say we about face
the fuck up out of here

58:37.925 --> 58:39.758
before I'm folding your shit in a box.

58:40.883 --> 58:43.050
Why don't we just go out and shoot 'em?

58:43.133 --> 58:45.842
I wouldn't mind putting some bullets
in those motherfuckers.

58:45.967 --> 58:48.425
Nope, guys. That's not our job,
okay? That's not...

58:48.508 --> 58:49.967
We are here to help these people.

58:50.592 --> 58:52.217
Those assholes don't want our help.

58:53.883 --> 58:58.342
- Why the hell should we give it to 'em?
- Yeah. The mission's a loser.

58:58.425 --> 58:59.758
Even machmoud knows it.

58:59.842 --> 59:02.508
He said they were fighting over
the water before we got here.

59:02.592 --> 59:05.425
If we put it back to normal,
that's just what normal is.

59:05.508 --> 59:07.092
Okay, guys, you got tonight.

59:08.217 --> 59:10.550
Okay? You get a whole fuckin' night
to be sad or angry

59:10.675 --> 59:13.175
or whatever the fuck you need
to secure your shit.

59:14.425 --> 59:16.092
And tomorrow we're punching back in.

59:18.217 --> 59:19.467
We're going back to work.

01:00:04.258 --> 01:00:07.217
[Guard] Ocre! Someone here for you.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.717
Mr. Matt!

01:00:18.008 --> 01:00:20.550
Mr. Matt, I'm sorry
for what happened to your friend.

01:00:21.633 --> 01:00:22.925
Uh, why are you here?

01:00:23.008 --> 01:00:26.217
- You say you bring water to the school.
- I said I'd try.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.675
That got fucked up
yesterday though, didn't it?

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:32.133
Mr. Matt, with no water,
the school will close.

01:00:32.217 --> 01:00:33.508
There are people there.

01:00:33.592 --> 01:00:36.133
It's a community center,
not only for children.

01:00:36.217 --> 01:00:39.175
That's great.
Just stop shooting at us.

01:00:39.258 --> 01:00:41.967
We... we don't shoot.
Not the people at the school.

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:44.508
We want the same thing as you do.

01:00:44.592 --> 01:00:47.383
Really? What?

01:00:48.883 --> 01:00:52.050
We want clean water.
And for you to go home.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.592
[Matt scoffs]

01:00:54.675 --> 01:00:57.842
We've been trying.
No one will help us.

01:00:57.925 --> 01:00:59.800
Maybe you are asking the wrong people.

01:01:00.717 --> 01:01:03.758
Mr. Matt! Mr. Matt!

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.008
[Sighs]

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:21.842
I don't get it.
You're gonna have to talk me through this.

01:01:21.925 --> 01:01:24.609
[Harper] We've been given money
and told to use it to get local labor.

01:01:24.633 --> 01:01:28.425
I've done this before. You talk to the guy
in charge, and that's the sheikh.

01:01:28.508 --> 01:01:31.883
And he's been very clear
that the locals will not work with us.

01:01:31.967 --> 01:01:35.087
Well, that's exactly why we need somebody
who's gonna do what the sheikh won't.

01:01:36.175 --> 01:01:37.967
And you think a schoolteacher
is the answer?

01:01:38.717 --> 01:01:43.633
All due respect, sir, we're down
a tanker and we lost a man yesterday.

01:01:44.758 --> 01:01:46.925
I gotta activate these guys.

01:01:47.008 --> 01:01:48.693
Okay? And we can't do this on our own.
I'm just...

01:01:48.717 --> 01:01:50.508
I'm requesting you hear the private out.

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.300
Fine.

01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:54.550
Private?

01:01:57.133 --> 01:02:01.050
Sir, I'm... I'm gonna be honest. I...
I haven't really formulated a plan, but...

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:04.315
You know, nothing we've tried is working.

01:02:04.342 --> 01:02:05.467
This man...

01:02:06.383 --> 01:02:08.583
Seems to have a legitimate reason
to wanna work with us.

01:02:09.175 --> 01:02:11.050
So maybe we could use that
as an opportunity

01:02:11.133 --> 01:02:12.883
to reach out to the community.

01:02:12.967 --> 01:02:14.647
What makes you think
we can trust this guy?

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.467
I think if sergeant Harper
and I go to the school,

01:02:19.383 --> 01:02:22.050
perhaps we can figure something out, sir.

01:02:24.425 --> 01:02:26.133
Just don't fuck this up.

01:02:26.217 --> 01:02:27.383
Roger that, sir.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.550
[Children clamoring]

01:03:09.883 --> 01:03:11.592
Is that all?

01:03:11.675 --> 01:03:12.842
Uh, yeah, yeah.

01:03:12.925 --> 01:03:15.800
Unfortunately, without the tanker,
that's the best we can do.

01:03:15.883 --> 01:03:16.967
I understand.

01:03:18.050 --> 01:03:19.800
Thank you.

01:03:19.883 --> 01:03:22.550
Very grateful. Thank you.

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:26.133
Kadeer, um, you said
we were talking to the wrong people.

01:03:26.217 --> 01:03:29.342
Could you explain to the people here
what we're doing, why we're here?

01:03:30.425 --> 01:03:32.675
- They know.
- Yeah, but they won't help.

01:03:36.383 --> 01:03:38.342
Working with the Americans
is very dangerous.

01:03:38.425 --> 01:03:40.425
How can you guarantee their safety?

01:03:40.508 --> 01:03:42.717
[Matt] Well, they won't be seen
collaborating with us.

01:03:43.383 --> 01:03:44.758
Everything goes through you.

01:03:44.842 --> 01:03:47.842
You talk to them.
You bring them to the pumping station.

01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:49.092
Nobody has to know.

01:03:53.508 --> 01:03:55.425
Look, it's your terms, okay?

01:03:55.508 --> 01:03:58.148
You bring us the workers,
we give the water at the pumping station.

01:03:58.217 --> 01:04:00.800
And look, we're gonna
pay them in cash. And you.

01:04:00.883 --> 01:04:03.425
Uh, I don't need the money.
The money is for the school.

01:04:08.175 --> 01:04:10.258
I will try. I will speak with them.

01:04:10.342 --> 01:04:12.383
[Both speaking arabic]

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:21.050
Hey, machmoud.

01:04:21.133 --> 01:04:22.967
[Both speaking arabic]

01:04:44.967 --> 01:04:46.359
<i>[Soldier on radio]
Sergeant Harper, main gate.</i>

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.133
<i>Looks like your hajjis are here.</i>

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.758
<i>Could you come down
and verify, please? Over.</i>

01:04:50.842 --> 01:04:52.133
Yeah, we'll be right down.

01:04:52.217 --> 01:04:54.008
You wanted workers?
You got workers.

01:05:07.467 --> 01:05:09.151
- [Men shouting indistinctly]
- [Soldier] What's in the bag?

01:05:09.175 --> 01:05:10.717
Hey, hey. Step away from the bag.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.175
Hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down.

01:05:13.258 --> 01:05:15.342
- Step away from the bag.
- [Matt] Kadeer.

01:05:15.425 --> 01:05:18.383
- [Kadeer] Mr. Matt! Mr. Matt.
- My name is sergeant Harper.

01:05:18.467 --> 01:05:19.758
[Harper] Guys, guys. [Shushes]

01:05:19.842 --> 01:05:22.883
I need everybody to calm...
I need everybody quiet.

01:05:22.967 --> 01:05:25.050
[Soldier] He's got this bag.
I... it's suspicious.

01:05:25.133 --> 01:05:27.318
There's precision tools in there.
I don't like the looks of it.

01:05:27.342 --> 01:05:30.758
Kadeer. Kadeer, please tell...
This is your brother?

01:05:30.842 --> 01:05:33.383
Yes, Mr. Harper.
My brother is an engineer.

01:05:33.467 --> 01:05:35.800
Here... here he...
He is here to help you.

01:05:35.883 --> 01:05:38.175
Okay. Uh, we're gonna need your brother

01:05:38.258 --> 01:05:40.383
to show my private the contents
of that bag.

01:05:40.467 --> 01:05:42.092
[Both speaking arabic]

01:05:44.842 --> 01:05:46.383
- I'm sorry. It's procedure.
- Please.

01:05:46.467 --> 01:05:47.693
- There's no disrespect.
- Please.

[Machmoud and arif speaking arabic]

01:05:48.925 --> 01:05:50.300
[Soldier] Nice and slow.

01:05:50.383 --> 01:05:52.467
Okay. Okay. Perfect.

01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:53.550
Perfect.

01:05:54.467 --> 01:05:55.967
Yeah. Can you move this?

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.050
Move this.

01:05:59.633 --> 01:06:01.401
- [Harper] Okay.
- Okay, that's great. It's clean.

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:03.068
All right, everybody...
Everybody, calm down.

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:05.175
- Thank you.
- Please put the bag on the ground.

01:06:05.258 --> 01:06:07.633
Machmoud, tell him
to get to the back of the line.

01:06:07.717 --> 01:06:09.776
- You're still gonna be patted down.
- [Speaking arabic]

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.234
Corporal, I want you
to start patting guys down.

01:06:11.258 --> 01:06:12.359
- Ocre, help corporal.
- Yep.

01:06:12.383 --> 01:06:15.068
Private, I want you to search that car
right now. Thoroughly. Thank you.

01:06:15.092 --> 01:06:16.467

01:07:15.383 --> 01:07:17.693
[In english] He said they stopped
manufacturing this piece.

01:07:17.717 --> 01:07:19.550
I know that. Can he fix it?

01:07:19.633 --> 01:07:21.467
[Both speaking arabic]

01:07:22.967 --> 01:07:24.092

01:07:25.383 --> 01:07:27.883
[Both speaking arabic]

01:07:29.508 --> 01:07:31.383
[In english] He can make a new one.

01:07:31.467 --> 01:07:34.383
- How long does he need?
- [In english] Uh, two or three days.

01:07:35.633 --> 01:07:36.925
Great. Have at it.

01:07:39.467 --> 01:07:42.258
So you, um...
You speak English too?

01:07:42.342 --> 01:07:43.717
Yes.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.758
How... how'd you learn all that stuff?

01:07:47.133 --> 01:07:50.508
Here, in university of mosul.

01:07:50.592 --> 01:07:52.258
- Ah.
- Mechanical engineering.

01:07:56.342 --> 01:07:58.217
You go to university?

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.300
No. No, no, no, it was too expensive.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.550
You have to pay to study?
It's not free?

01:08:03.633 --> 01:08:04.883
Yeah.

01:08:04.967 --> 01:08:06.967
- What, it's free here?
- Of course.

01:08:07.967 --> 01:08:10.425
Shit. Well, in America nothing's free.

Huh. Okay.
Hey, why do you paint her green?

01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:52.175
Strays around here, wild and pissed off.
People shoot 'em on sight.

Yup. Can't come soon enough.

All I'm looking forward to...

01:10:00.883 --> 01:10:03.675
Is getting back home
to the frisky kitty buffet.

- [Burton] Who do you wanna see?

Who you wanna see?

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:10.425
- Mercedes.
- Mercedes, baby.

01:10:10.508 --> 01:10:12.633
You know why.
'Cause how we like 'em, Burton?

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.425
Mre. This is, uh... penne and vegetable.

01:10:28.008 --> 01:10:30.217
- It's good?
- Yeah, you want some?

01:10:31.342 --> 01:10:33.508
No. You try chicken pilaf?

01:10:33.592 --> 01:10:36.092
- Yeah, man.
- Chicken and rice.

01:10:36.175 --> 01:10:37.967
- Do you want it?
- No, no.

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:39.300
- Try some chicken.
- Okay.

01:10:39.383 --> 01:10:40.758
Here, taste.

01:10:41.883 --> 01:10:43.008
My wife, she made this.

01:10:44.383 --> 01:10:45.800
- Uh-uh, sarge.
- It's not chicken.

01:10:45.883 --> 01:10:48.425
- Don't do it.
- How many chickens do you see out here?

01:10:48.508 --> 01:10:50.151
- Here, you try it first.
- I'm good. I'm full.

01:10:50.175 --> 01:10:52.092

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.592
That's fuckin' amazing. [Chuckles]

01:11:03.675 --> 01:11:04.842
My compliments to your wife.

01:11:04.925 --> 01:11:06.050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:11:07.175 --> 01:11:08.258
Nah, I'm joking.

01:11:08.342 --> 01:11:10.068
[Enzo chuckles] Yeah,
I told you he would, man.

01:11:10.092 --> 01:11:11.425
[Burton chuckles]

01:11:13.883 --> 01:11:15.401
You sure you don't want some of my penne?

01:11:15.425 --> 01:11:18.050
No, really, it's... no.

01:11:18.967 --> 01:11:20.008
Smart man.

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:21.710

- Say it.

01:11:49.967 --> 01:11:51.633
This is for...

01:11:51.717 --> 01:11:53.651

[Enzo grunts]

01:12:04.633 --> 01:12:08.300
- He loved this music. [Laughs]
- He did not fucking love this music.

01:12:08.383 --> 01:12:10.151
[Matt] He fuckin' only listened
to country music.

01:12:10.175 --> 01:12:11.925
[All laughing]

01:12:13.758 --> 01:12:15.758
[Burton] He's good.
No, he's good for it.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:27.508
Okay, where the fuck

01:13:16.633 --> 01:13:18.758
[Woman lamenting indistinctly]

01:13:19.675 --> 01:13:22.342
[Harper] Okay, Enzo, Burton,
full security.

01:13:22.967 --> 01:13:24.883
Machmoud, come here.

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:29.217
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- [Woman lamenting and speaking arabic]

01:13:42.508 --> 01:13:44.508
[Woman continues lamenting]

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:52.592
[Lamenting and speaking arabic]

01:13:54.258 --> 01:13:55.967
[Harper] We got...
We got a situation here.

01:13:56.050 --> 01:13:58.967
You're gonna have to get higher
on the horn, okay? Out. Copy.

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:00.508
[Men shouting indistinctly]

01:14:00.592 --> 01:14:02.383
[Lamenting continues]

01:14:09.217 --> 01:14:10.967
[Lamenting continues]

01:14:15.342 --> 01:14:16.925
[Speaking arabic]

01:15:01.967 --> 01:15:04.967
The downtown market here
is where they are based.

01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:06.258
They meet at night.

01:15:07.342 --> 01:15:11.675
The flower shop here...
Is where I think they hide their weapons.

01:15:11.758 --> 01:15:16.175
I know the place. Thank you.
And we're sorry for your loss.

01:15:17.675 --> 01:15:19.175
I don't need your thanks.

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:25.842
Bj, would you, uh, escort
this gentleman out, please?

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.758
Harper, ocre.

01:15:36.092 --> 01:15:38.217
Do you guys think this info is credible?

01:15:39.008 --> 01:15:41.258
Should see what they did
to this guy's brother.

01:15:42.675 --> 01:15:44.425
He's got every reason to want to help us.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.800
Pepps?

01:15:48.925 --> 01:15:51.258
[Sighs] Seems like too good
an opportunity to pass.

01:15:52.175 --> 01:15:55.258
Okay. Well, this intel's only gonna
last so long before it goes bad,

01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:56.925
so we got to move.

01:15:57.008 --> 01:16:00.092
My guess, we can take two teams.
I'll lead Alpha on the back.

01:16:00.175 --> 01:16:02.217
I'll take bravo and make entry,
hold the front.

01:16:03.008 --> 01:16:04.425
I can get the guys in there,

01:16:04.508 --> 01:16:06.868
but we don't have enough vehicles
to block the street, so...

01:16:07.383 --> 01:16:10.467
- We're gonna be needin' your help.
- Yeah, Roger that.

01:16:11.925 --> 01:16:14.508
Good.
Full brief in about an hour.

01:16:20.467 --> 01:16:22.175
[Harper] I know. I've...
I heard you, Anne.

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.467
Anne, I... look, will you just...
Will you say it?

01:16:29.925 --> 01:16:32.925
- Shit, sorry. I'll come back.
- No, man, [Stammers] You're good.

01:16:33.008 --> 01:16:34.568
Will you just say it
even if you don't mean it, Anne?

01:16:34.592 --> 01:16:35.633
Just say it.

01:16:35.717 --> 01:16:36.842
No, never mind.

01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:39.092
Okay, Anne.

01:16:40.633 --> 01:16:42.175
[Chuckles] You take care too.

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:45.758
Hey, phone's free if you want.

01:16:45.842 --> 01:16:47.008
[Scoffs softly]

01:16:58.467 --> 01:17:00.008
[Smacks lips] You good?

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:02.925
Yup. Yeah. Yup.

01:17:04.758 --> 01:17:06.008
[Sniffles]

01:17:09.633 --> 01:17:12.633
Hey, bro, you know, we're finally gonna
get a chance to get these guys.

01:17:14.883 --> 01:17:20.133
Then we can finish the pump station,
fix it, go home.

01:17:25.217 --> 01:17:26.383
[Softly] Yeah.

01:17:26.467 --> 01:17:28.967
"There's a bullet out there
for everyone..."

01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:33.758
With their names written small
on the side.

01:17:36.008 --> 01:17:38.300
"Mine is coming." [Chuckles]

01:17:40.633 --> 01:17:42.342
No, my dad used to say that.

01:17:44.217 --> 01:17:45.383
That's comforting.

01:17:46.633 --> 01:17:48.592
But it is, if you think about it.

01:17:50.383 --> 01:17:52.633
You know, maybe...
Maybe my bullet's waiting out there.

01:17:53.675 --> 01:17:56.675
Or maybe my bullet is cancer.
Gonna hit me 50 years from now.

01:17:57.592 --> 01:17:59.342
Oh, but that's not up to me.

01:18:00.258 --> 01:18:01.425
So why worry?

01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:16.467
Sure you're up for this, huh?

01:18:17.967 --> 01:18:19.175
Yeah.

01:19:04.967 --> 01:19:07.508
- [Burton] Are you good?
- [Enzo] Hell no, I ain't good.

01:19:07.592 --> 01:19:08.967
This is war, baby.

01:19:12.133 --> 01:19:14.609
I'm just fuckin' scared, man.
My hands shaking and shit, like...

01:19:14.633 --> 01:19:17.883
- Now look at me. Look at me.
- A little bitch.

01:19:17.967 --> 01:19:19.758
Now you drive this motherfucker.

01:19:20.675 --> 01:19:22.592
And I shoot anything that gets in the way.

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.592
You understand me?

01:19:28.467 --> 01:19:30.300
You keep me safe up there.

01:19:30.383 --> 01:19:32.425
[Scoffs] You know it. Come on.

01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:36.370
[Both inhale sharply and exclaim]

01:19:49.175 --> 01:19:50.258
Hey, James.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.217

You gotta hurry up, please!

01:28:18.717 --> 01:28:21.550
He's my friend.
He's my fuckin' friend, man.

01:28:21.633 --> 01:28:22.925
Is he breathing?

01:28:23.008 --> 01:28:25.675
I don't fuckin' know, man.
He's hurt pretty fuckin' bad.

01:28:25.758 --> 01:28:27.133
He's hurt bad.

01:28:27.217 --> 01:28:28.901
All right, just breathe.
Just breathe. Come on.

01:28:28.925 --> 01:28:31.300
Come on. Come on.
That's right. Stay up. Stay up.

He's not looking too good, all right?

Attention.

01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:21.633
At ease.

01:38:38.717 --> 01:38:40.050

01:38:40.842 --> 01:38:43.842
Three weeks' leave

Private ocre.

What do you say we get you back
on level ground?

01:38:55.092 --> 01:38:57.633
There's a convoy leaving at 1400.

01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:00.175
It'll take you to the balad flightline

01:39:00.258 --> 01:39:02.342
and a c-130 will take you
back to the states.

01:39:06.008 --> 01:39:09.425
I'm happy to waive my leave, sir.
If it's all the same, I'll stay.

The lieutenant
is not giving you leave, son.

01:39:14.425 --> 01:39:15.800
You're going home, private.

01:39:18.467 --> 01:39:20.193
Sergeant major, there is no reason
to be concerned about...

01:39:20.217 --> 01:39:21.633
Your war is over.

01:39:22.592 --> 01:39:25.217
[Stammers] No, it isn't over.

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:27.217
- The war isn't over...
- Excuse me?

01:39:28.842 --> 01:39:30.925
With all due respect,
what happened in baqubah...

01:39:31.008 --> 01:39:33.050
Permission to speak freely, sir?

01:39:33.133 --> 01:39:34.508
Yeah.

01:39:34.592 --> 01:39:36.800
As the nco in charge of private ocre,
it is my opinion

01:39:36.883 --> 01:39:39.109
that he has nothing more to prove
to himself or to anybody else.

01:39:39.133 --> 01:39:42.217
- It's not about proving anything...
- Ocre. Ocre.

01:39:44.258 --> 01:39:45.842
- It's time to go home, Matt.
- No.

01:39:45.925 --> 01:39:48.925
- This is the time when we are...
- Take it easy there, son.

01:39:49.842 --> 01:39:53.258
Sergeant major, I think we need
to talk about what happened,

01:39:53.342 --> 01:39:54.502
and then maybe we can fix it.

01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:56.633
Your job is done here!

01:39:57.258 --> 01:39:58.258
How?

01:40:00.217 --> 01:40:02.577
No, please, someone tell me
how my fuckin' job is done here,

01:40:02.633 --> 01:40:05.258
- because I don't see how it's...
- God damn it, private!

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:08.258
You're dismissed.

01:40:37.842 --> 01:40:39.217
[Harper] What, you a smoker now?

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:46.425
They, uh, made me see the chaplain.

01:40:46.508 --> 01:40:47.592
Ooh.

01:40:50.258 --> 01:40:51.258
What'd he say?

01:40:52.883 --> 01:40:54.217
It's, uh, god's plan.

01:40:56.342 --> 01:40:59.675
Then he asked if I smoke.
I said no.

01:40:59.758 --> 01:41:03.133
So, uh, he gives me these and said
maybe I should consider starting.

01:41:04.633 --> 01:41:06.425
How about you?
What you thinking about?

01:41:11.967 --> 01:41:13.800
What am I thinking about? Uh...

01:41:17.092 --> 01:41:19.050
I'm thinking about a royals game.

01:41:20.758 --> 01:41:22.217
A royals game...

01:41:23.425 --> 01:41:24.550
A tecate...

01:41:25.633 --> 01:41:27.008
And garlic fries.

01:41:27.633 --> 01:41:30.675
- Ooh, garlic fries.
- Yup.

01:41:33.717 --> 01:41:34.776
I start thinking about that,

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.920
and all this other shit
starts rushing back, you know?

01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:40.258
I haven't even thought about home
for a long time.

01:41:46.508 --> 01:41:49.383
Did I tell you some captain
told me to blouse my boots today?

01:41:49.467 --> 01:41:51.050
Can you believe that shit?

01:41:51.133 --> 01:41:52.925
Some dude fresh off the boat,

01:41:53.008 --> 01:41:56.008
hasn't done a damn thing, tells me
to blouse my boots and look professional.

01:41:56.675 --> 01:41:59.925
I was fucking pissed,
not just 'cause of the boot thing, but...

01:42:00.008 --> 01:42:01.008
But what?

01:42:03.508 --> 01:42:05.758
You know, we fucking had it, sergeant.

01:42:05.842 --> 01:42:07.842
The people were with us.
The water was gonna flow.

01:42:07.925 --> 01:42:09.592
It wasn't ours to have, ocre.

01:42:11.425 --> 01:42:13.925
- You got nothing to feel guilty about.
- No, but...

01:42:14.008 --> 01:42:16.425
Okay? For whatever you did
or whatever you didn't do.

01:42:16.508 --> 01:42:17.508
No, I...

01:42:19.758 --> 01:42:22.842
I broke my own hand back in Kuwait.
I slammed it in a Hummer door.

01:42:23.758 --> 01:42:26.425
Just... trying to get out
of all this shit.

01:42:27.342 --> 01:42:28.550

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:35.967

01:42:49.133 --> 01:42:50.383
Hey, you want these?

01:42:51.842 --> 01:42:52.842
Nope.

01:43:39.258 --> 01:43:41.342
[Aircraft passing overhead]

01:43:47.092 --> 01:43:48.842
Confusing feeling, ain't it?

01:43:50.092 --> 01:43:52.425
All we do is think about going home...

01:43:54.175 --> 01:43:55.717
Now, here it is.

01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:59.050
I don't feel anything, sergeant major.

01:43:59.592 --> 01:44:01.925
Yeah, it takes a while before it kicks in.

01:44:02.717 --> 01:44:05.008
But it'll catch up. Believe me.

01:44:07.758 --> 01:44:09.883
[Takes deep breath] Good luck, son.

01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:15.467
Hey, sergeant major?

01:44:18.508 --> 01:44:20.383
Beautiful day for the infantry?

01:44:22.842 --> 01:44:24.008

01:44:37.258 --> 01:44:39.300

Gonna miss your flight.

01:44:40.883 --> 01:44:41.883
Yeah.
