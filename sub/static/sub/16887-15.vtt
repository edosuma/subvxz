00:00.564 --> 00:01.564
Hey, I'm Chuck.

00:01.565 --> 00:04.065
Here's a couple of things you might
need to know or maybe you just forgot.

00:04.566 --> 00:06.066
You're not going to
need any help, are you?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.039
I'm gonna need that back.

00:08.841 --> 00:11.341
Sarah and I aren't going to be
seeing each other right now

00:12.650 --> 00:14.650
We know Chuck could have
FULCRUM's program in him.

00:53.102 --> 00:54.736
Who's the stiff?

00:54.804 --> 00:57.172
The corpse was dug up
from a CIA dump site.

00:57.239 --> 00:59.007
The grave belonged to
Brad White.

00:59.108 --> 01:00.875
That's one
of the FULCRUM agents

01:00.943 --> 01:03.144
who ran the Intersect
test on Chuck.

01:03.212 --> 01:04.679
Why would they
rob his grave?

01:04.747 --> 01:06.047
That's what we need you
to find out.

01:06.115 --> 01:07.949
We picked up chatter
that whatever they took

01:08.017 --> 01:09.617
is potentially
game-changing intelligence.

01:09.685 --> 01:11.820
You want us to grab Chuck,
keep him underground?

01:11.887 --> 01:13.721
I don't think
that's necessary yet,

01:13.789 --> 01:15.356
but keep a close eye
on the asset

01:15.424 --> 01:17.158
until we have
further information.

01:17.226 --> 01:18.860
Don't let him out of your sight.

01:24.033 --> 01:25.166
Chuck, it's Sarah.

01:25.234 --> 01:26.434
Don't you want
to answer it?

01:26.502 --> 01:28.169
Oh, you know, I'm going to...

01:28.237 --> 01:30.638
see her later anyway, so...

01:30.706 --> 01:31.873
Yeah.

01:31.941 --> 01:33.441
Sometimes you got
to play hard to get.

01:33.509 --> 01:36.311
Cold and detached is a very
powerful aphrodisiac, babe.

01:36.378 --> 01:37.345
So is abstinence.

01:37.413 --> 01:38.379
You want to try it?

01:39.582 --> 01:40.682
Not getting involved.

01:40.749 --> 01:43.084
Chuck,
the other night,

01:43.152 --> 01:44.586
you said some pretty
heavy things about Sarah,

01:44.653 --> 01:45.687
about her not being the one.

01:47.223 --> 01:49.557
Well, you know, I mean,
we've got our issues.

01:49.625 --> 01:51.226
But don't... don't
worry, sis; it will all

01:51.293 --> 01:52.327
work itself out.

01:52.394 --> 01:53.428
No, Chuck,
it won't.

01:53.496 --> 01:54.896
That's what you
always say, you know.

01:54.964 --> 01:56.164
You have
to take control

01:56.232 --> 01:58.366
of your life if you want
to move forward.

01:58.434 --> 02:00.668
You said you'd work
at the Buy More temporarily.

02:00.736 --> 02:02.070
It's been...
it's been five years.

02:03.239 --> 02:05.140
It's-it's just...

02:05.207 --> 02:07.876
it's not so easy breaking up
with Sarah Walker, you know.

02:07.943 --> 02:09.244
It's, uh...
it's a little complicated.

02:09.311 --> 02:10.277
I know.

02:10.346 --> 02:11.846
I know, and I love Sarah.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.648
I just think
that if she's not the one,

02:13.716 --> 02:14.716
you got to tell her.

02:14.783 --> 02:16.084
You're not just
hurting her.

02:16.152 --> 02:17.252
You're hurting
yourself.

02:17.319 --> 02:18.586
<i>Dude, do you have any idea</i>

02:18.654 --> 02:19.888
<i>what it's like</i>
<i>to be in a relationship</i>

02:19.955 --> 02:21.156
that's so upsetting

02:21.223 --> 02:22.857
that it just keeps
you up at night?

02:22.925 --> 02:23.892
Vaguely familiar.

02:23.959 --> 02:25.126
I don't think
you do, man.

02:25.194 --> 02:26.127
All right,
look at me.

02:26.195 --> 02:27.395
I haven't slept in days.

02:27.463 --> 02:29.397
You know, if I don't get
at least 12 hours,

02:29.465 --> 02:30.598
I'm a basket case.

02:30.666 --> 02:32.100
Something wrong
with you and Anna?

02:32.168 --> 02:33.735
She's out of town.
We're actually really good.

02:33.802 --> 02:35.236
No, it's my mom
and Big Mike, dude.

02:35.304 --> 02:36.804
They're like teenagers.

02:36.872 --> 02:39.440
They just keep going at it
and keep going at it.

02:39.508 --> 02:42.844
The man moans like
a wounded sea lion.

02:45.481 --> 02:46.781
Anyway, listen,
I was just wondering

02:46.849 --> 02:48.917
if I could just crash
with you for a little

02:48.984 --> 02:50.418
till this whole thing blows over.

02:50.486 --> 02:52.487
Uh... uh, yeah.

02:52.555 --> 02:53.955
You know what,
buddy, I'll run it

02:54.023 --> 02:55.924
by Ellie and Awesome.
Thank you, thank you.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.062
Screening my calls?

03:01.130 --> 03:02.797
Hey... no, no.

03:02.865 --> 03:03.898
Uh, no.

03:03.966 --> 03:05.633
Yes, a little.

03:05.701 --> 03:07.936
I've been meaning
to talk to you.

03:08.003 --> 03:09.604
I just... I was waiting
for the right time,

03:09.672 --> 03:11.206
and I've been really
slammed here at work.

03:11.273 --> 03:12.907
Can I buy you a frozen yogurt?

03:12.975 --> 03:14.375
Sure.

03:18.681 --> 03:20.281
So, what did you
want to talk about?

03:20.349 --> 03:21.516
You can go first.
Well, mine's

03:21.584 --> 03:23.284
spy-related, and I have
a feeling yours isn't.

03:23.352 --> 03:25.153
Um...

03:25.221 --> 03:26.921
I... I wanted

03:26.989 --> 03:28.323
to talk about us.

03:28.390 --> 03:30.225
You want to break up again.

03:30.292 --> 03:32.961
I caught some chatter
through bites of cereal

03:33.028 --> 03:34.395
on the
surveillance tap.

03:34.463 --> 03:35.797
Sorry, it's an
occupational hazard.

03:35.864 --> 03:37.365
Um...

03:37.433 --> 03:39.300
of course.

03:39.368 --> 03:40.602
Look...

03:40.669 --> 03:43.004
Sarah, it's not you.

03:43.072 --> 03:44.639
It's me.
- Probably not

03:44.707 --> 03:46.774
the best idea to give the
"It's not you, it's me" speech

03:46.842 --> 03:47.976
to a trained assassin
wielding a knife.

03:48.043 --> 03:49.444
I was warming up

03:49.511 --> 03:51.246
into more original
terrain.

03:51.313 --> 03:53.815
Can you give us a minute,
please, Casey?

03:53.882 --> 03:55.483
Um...

03:55.551 --> 03:59.387
look, Sarah, you know how much
I care about you.

03:59.455 --> 04:00.588
It-it's just getting...
it's getting

04:00.656 --> 04:02.690
so complicated
lying to my sister

04:02.758 --> 04:04.058
and my... and my friends.
Sometimes, I don't

04:04.126 --> 04:05.393
even know what lie I'm telling.

04:05.461 --> 04:07.562
Look, tell them
we're taking things slowly

04:07.630 --> 04:09.530
and that while we enjoy
each other's company,

04:09.598 --> 04:11.633
we don't really feel the need
to label it,

04:11.700 --> 04:14.002
and who knows
what the future holds for us?

04:15.738 --> 04:17.338
But that's... that's just
another lie, isn't it?

04:17.406 --> 04:18.406
We'll never really be together.

04:22.111 --> 04:24.078
Exactly.

04:24.146 --> 04:26.347
Exactly, and that's why
I think we should break up.

04:26.415 --> 04:28.283
Is that what you really want?

04:28.350 --> 04:30.618
Yes, it is.

04:30.686 --> 04:32.253
Great... most annoying romance

04:32.321 --> 04:33.521
of my life is finally over.

04:33.589 --> 04:34.656
Downstairs now.

04:34.723 --> 04:36.991
Come on.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.193
We were able to lift a print
off the body bag.

04:40.896 --> 04:44.432
It seems the grave was robbed
by a FULCRUM agent, Cole Barker.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.034
Seems like a real ladies' man.

04:46.101 --> 04:48.336
He arrived at LAX this morning

04:48.404 --> 04:50.138
and took a cab
to the Standard Hotel.

04:50.205 --> 04:51.539
We suspect
that's where he's going

04:51.607 --> 04:53.074
to meet his FULCRUM
contact later

04:53.142 --> 04:54.075
and make a handoff.

04:54.143 --> 04:55.076
Agent Walker will attempt

04:55.144 --> 04:56.978
to retrieve the intelligence

04:57.046 --> 04:59.347
he's carrying
using any means necessary.

04:59.415 --> 05:01.049
That's all.

05:05.187 --> 05:07.221
Hey, can... can we...
can we get a little closer

05:07.289 --> 05:09.223
on this picture of Cole,
maybe push in on his...

05:09.291 --> 05:11.025
"groinal" area?

05:13.429 --> 05:14.996
What, you seeing
something you like

05:15.064 --> 05:15.863
down there,
Bartowski?

05:22.905 --> 05:24.472
Oh.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.007
Okay, I just flashed,

05:26.075 --> 05:28.042
and the intelligence
is in Cole's belt buckle.

05:29.345 --> 05:30.578
Huh.

05:30.646 --> 05:32.613
Well, you're going to have
to get his pants off,

05:32.681 --> 05:33.815
huh, Walker?

05:33.882 --> 05:34.916
Good thing
Bartowski dumped you.

05:54.436 --> 05:55.870
# Na-na na-na na-na #

05:55.938 --> 05:58.806
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

05:58.874 --> 06:00.408
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:00.476 --> 06:02.076
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:02.144 --> 06:03.611
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:03.679 --> 06:06.914
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:15.934 --> 06:17.602
Grimes.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.170
Or should I
call you son?

06:19.238 --> 06:20.605
Who the hell
are all those geeks

06:20.672 --> 06:22.440
over there
at the customer service desk?

06:22.508 --> 06:24.175
You were supposed to hire
a new green shirt today.

06:25.878 --> 06:27.311
You want to do the interview?

06:27.379 --> 06:29.414
Get a little taste
of what the power

06:29.481 --> 06:31.115
of management is?
- Hmm.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.250
Why can't you do it?

06:32.317 --> 06:33.451
Well, your mama
asked me

06:33.519 --> 06:34.685
to stop by
the house today

06:34.753 --> 06:36.921
and take care
of a few things.

06:36.989 --> 06:38.222
There hasn't been
a man around there

06:38.290 --> 06:39.357
in a while,
and certain things

06:39.425 --> 06:41.092
have become...
neglected.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.126
Like what?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.997
Uh, the...
the plumbing's a mess.

06:46.064 --> 06:48.232
I got to get over there,
and I got to lay down some pipe.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.301
I got to snake
the drains,

06:50.369 --> 06:51.569
make sure everything

06:51.637 --> 06:54.005
is running smoothly again.
- Oh, God.

06:54.072 --> 06:55.606
You're in charge, son.

06:55.674 --> 06:56.741
Just think.

06:56.809 --> 06:59.110
All this could
be yours some day.

07:02.314 --> 07:03.714
I wish we could hire

07:03.782 --> 07:05.349
a green shirt
that looked like that.

07:07.553 --> 07:10.121
Hey, buddy, if you got too much
on your plate emotionally,

07:10.189 --> 07:11.622
Jeff and I can help out
with the interviews.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.558
That's, um, oddly sensitive
of you

07:13.625 --> 07:15.226
and I appreciate it-- thank you.

07:15.294 --> 07:17.762
Absolutely.

07:17.830 --> 07:18.796
You know what I'm thinking?

07:20.132 --> 07:21.866
Casting couch.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.636
<i>I kind of like her.</i>

07:26.872 --> 07:28.272
And her.

07:28.340 --> 07:30.208
Wait... why
are these babes

07:30.275 --> 07:32.043
going to get busy with us again?

07:32.110 --> 07:33.945
The casting couch
is a long-honored tradition

07:34.012 --> 07:35.513
between men and women, Jeffrey.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.548
We offer fame
and fortune.

07:37.616 --> 07:39.717
They offer themselves.

07:39.785 --> 07:41.452
For a job as a green shirt?

07:41.520 --> 07:44.956
Ah... for the opportunity
of a lifetime.

07:45.023 --> 07:46.557
A high-paying modeling job

07:46.625 --> 07:49.427
at Burbank's finest
electronics store.

07:49.495 --> 07:51.929
May I present
to you...

07:51.997 --> 07:54.232
the Buy More babe.

07:55.501 --> 07:56.834
Lester,

07:56.902 --> 07:58.336
you're a genius.

08:10.549 --> 08:11.616
Game on.

08:11.683 --> 08:12.950
Beefcake just stepped in.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.062
Where is his contact?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.998
Do I have an Intersect
in my head? Look around.

08:27.065 --> 08:28.165
We don't have
much time

08:28.233 --> 08:29.600
here, Walker,
so get to his room.

08:29.668 --> 08:31.068
Get his belt off.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.770
Make it a quickie.

08:32.837 --> 08:34.371
M-maybe there's a...
maybe there's a...

08:34.438 --> 08:36.340
maybe there's a better way to do this.

08:36.408 --> 08:38.174
You know,
throw a sack

08:38.243 --> 08:39.409
over his head,
drag him outside.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.745
Come on, Casey, you're always...

08:40.812 --> 08:42.246
you're always up
for a good mugging.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.948
Can't risk his contact
seeing it.

08:44.015 --> 08:45.449
What's the matter,
Bartowski?

08:45.517 --> 08:46.517
Afraid of a little

08:46.585 --> 08:48.019
competition?

08:52.090 --> 08:53.157
Morgan, what are
you doing here?

08:53.225 --> 08:54.458
Chuck didn't tell you?

08:54.526 --> 08:55.393
Oh, man.

08:55.460 --> 08:56.561
This is kind
of embarrassing.

08:56.628 --> 09:00.131
My mom is, uh...
romantically

09:00.198 --> 09:01.999
involved with my
boss from work.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.502
So I need a place to stay.

09:04.570 --> 09:05.670
Big Mike's boning Bolonia?

09:05.737 --> 09:07.972
Gross, honey.
Morgan, look, uh...

09:08.040 --> 09:10.141
No, listen, El, El...
it'll just be for a few days.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.910
Okay, and I promise
I will earn my keep.

09:12.978 --> 09:14.178
I've already taken
the liberty of drawing

09:14.246 --> 09:15.580
a very hot
bubble bath.

09:15.647 --> 09:19.317
And ice-cold martinis.

09:20.752 --> 09:22.286
Dry with...

09:22.354 --> 09:24.255
olives!

09:24.323 --> 09:26.357
Well, thank you.
- Now, off to the tub

09:26.425 --> 09:27.625
with you, all right?

09:27.693 --> 09:29.560
The roast will be
out of the oven soon.

09:29.628 --> 09:32.096
A roast is
in the oven.

09:36.268 --> 09:37.668
Cole's FULCRUM

09:37.736 --> 09:38.970
contact's going
to be here any minute.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.738
Time to let it
all hang out, hmm?

09:40.806 --> 09:43.174
I'm just wondering
if it's safe for Sarah

09:43.241 --> 09:45.009
to be alone with
such a dangerous guy.

09:45.077 --> 09:46.911
It's okay, Chuck.
I've got protection.

09:46.979 --> 09:49.647
And besides,
we have a safe word.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.315
If I ask for any
Cristal champagne,

09:51.383 --> 09:52.550
Casey will know
I'm in trouble.

09:52.618 --> 09:53.951
She'll be fine.

09:54.019 --> 09:55.252
Trust me.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.088
It's not like
it's her first time.

10:03.095 --> 10:04.695
Hi.

10:04.763 --> 10:07.131
I noticed you
sitting alone.

10:07.199 --> 10:08.499
Very observant.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.134
Do you want some company?

10:10.202 --> 10:12.470
Not really.

10:12.537 --> 10:14.038
Well, neither do I.

10:14.106 --> 10:16.841
But, uh, the problem is,
if I sit alone at the bar,

10:16.908 --> 10:18.409
then every guy in here
is going to think

10:18.477 --> 10:19.877
I'm lonely
and desperate,

10:19.945 --> 10:22.046
and try and take a shot
at a total stranger.

10:22.114 --> 10:24.281
Isn't that what
you're doing right now?

10:25.484 --> 10:26.784
Guilty as charged.

10:26.852 --> 10:27.918
If we're going
to continue

10:27.986 --> 10:29.353
this conversation,

10:29.421 --> 10:32.423
I think I should make
one thing abundantly clear.

10:32.491 --> 10:34.225
I'm not a very nice guy.

10:34.292 --> 10:37.495
Good... 'cause I'm not
into nice guys.

10:37.562 --> 10:39.563
Really?

10:39.631 --> 10:42.033
Why is that?

10:42.100 --> 10:45.102
Well, all they want to do
is talk about their feelings

10:45.170 --> 10:46.804
and emotions,
and sometimes what a woman

10:46.872 --> 10:49.206
really wants is a man who acts.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.175
Well, then why don't
we stop talking

10:51.243 --> 10:53.611
and take this up to my room?

10:53.679 --> 10:56.881
You have my word:
nothing nice will happen.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.282
Good girl, Walker.

11:09.027 --> 11:10.194
What floor?

11:10.262 --> 11:11.429
Hit 11.

11:14.666 --> 11:16.100
Here we go.
Hot plate.

11:16.168 --> 11:17.401
This is incredible, Morgan.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.503
It is truly awesome.

11:19.571 --> 11:20.871
Yes!

11:20.939 --> 11:23.007
You know, food is kind of like
a seductress.

11:23.075 --> 11:25.543
You know? Um... let me
give you a little

11:25.610 --> 11:26.977
tidbit.

11:27.045 --> 11:28.813
I, uh, I scored Anna
by serving myself...

11:28.880 --> 11:30.448
ala mode.

11:30.515 --> 11:33.150
Ah, it's just a shame
that Chuck couldn't be here.

11:33.218 --> 11:35.619
Although, I'm pretty sure
he's probably enjoying

11:35.687 --> 11:37.488
his own delicious, little meal
right about now.

11:38.824 --> 11:41.025
Of course I mean
Sarah Walker.

11:41.093 --> 11:42.560
Yeah, if he hasn't broken up
with her yet.

11:44.096 --> 11:46.030
Uh, why on God's green Earth

11:46.098 --> 11:48.265
would he ever, ever break up
with Sarah?

11:48.333 --> 11:49.467
Ask Ellie.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.735
It was her idea.

11:50.802 --> 11:52.636
Really?
What?

11:52.704 --> 11:54.238
He said that he didn't think
she was the one.

11:54.306 --> 11:56.373
There are
a few precious things

11:56.441 --> 11:57.942
I know anything
about in this world.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.243
Chuck's one of them.

11:59.311 --> 12:01.879
Believe me,
Sarah's the one.

12:01.947 --> 12:03.214
How do you know?
- How do I know?

12:03.281 --> 12:04.582
It's all over the kid's face.

12:04.649 --> 12:06.884
When Chuck is around
Sarah, he is the Chuck

12:06.952 --> 12:08.285
that we always dreamed of,
all right?

12:08.353 --> 12:09.553
The Chuck that
has the potential

12:09.621 --> 12:10.888
to do anything
in the world.

12:12.657 --> 12:14.658
Maybe I shouldn't have told
Chuck to break up with Sarah.

12:14.726 --> 12:16.427
Well, look at the bright side,
honey:

12:16.495 --> 12:18.129
Chuck said he was moving out
years ago.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.663
It'll probably be years

12:19.731 --> 12:21.432
before he gets around
to breaking up with her.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.900
Which room is yours?

12:22.968 --> 12:24.001
1121.

12:24.069 --> 12:25.870
It's a suite
with a fantastic view,

12:25.937 --> 12:27.738
giant king-sized bed

12:27.806 --> 12:29.440
and a Jacuzzi tub.

12:29.508 --> 12:30.841
You okay?

12:30.909 --> 12:33.744
Who me? Yeah, yeah.

12:33.812 --> 12:35.479
I'm-I'm fine.
Just curious if I'll be home

12:35.547 --> 12:36.981
in time for <i>Charlie Rose.</i>

12:37.048 --> 12:39.116
Maybe you shouldn't listen.

12:39.184 --> 12:41.886
Let's take that earwig.
I will listen in case

12:41.953 --> 12:44.054
I flash on something.

12:51.863 --> 12:53.264
Like right now.

12:53.331 --> 12:54.598
Casey! Casey,
the two suits getting

12:54.666 --> 12:56.033
into the elevator right now;
they're FULCRUM.

12:56.101 --> 12:57.301
They could be the contact.

12:57.369 --> 12:58.936
You stay here.

12:59.004 --> 13:00.237
I'll handle this.

13:02.274 --> 13:03.107
Hey, guys.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.984
Could you hit 8?

13:15.287 --> 13:16.787
Here we are.

13:23.128 --> 13:25.162
Not so fast, honey.

13:27.499 --> 13:29.567
I usually don't do this
on a first date.

13:29.634 --> 13:30.835
Right, me, either.

13:38.009 --> 13:39.009
Oh-ho!

13:43.648 --> 13:46.083
Oh, yeah.

13:51.957 --> 13:54.024
Let me get a little
something from my purse.

13:54.092 --> 13:55.292
I've got everything we need.

13:56.728 --> 13:58.596
I hope this isn't too rough.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.297
We're just getting started.

14:00.365 --> 14:01.599
Oh, yeah...

14:03.768 --> 14:04.602
Uh, bartender,
something

14:04.669 --> 14:05.936
really strong, please.

14:06.004 --> 14:08.205
Let's get
this belt off.

14:11.843 --> 14:14.211
Whoa, slow down, tiger.

14:14.279 --> 14:16.013
I told you I wasn't
a nice guy.

14:23.555 --> 14:25.656
Okay, hands up! NSA.

14:25.724 --> 14:27.925
It'll be okay, ma'am.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.827
Step off the elevator
with your baby.

14:29.895 --> 14:31.161
Please, just don't shoot.

14:41.573 --> 14:43.674
I'm, uh... I'm willing
to try new things,

14:43.742 --> 14:46.110
but it's, uh, it's getting
a little hot in here.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.645
I wonder if we could
maybe grab some champagne?

14:49.814 --> 14:51.982
Maybe some Cristal?

14:54.986 --> 14:57.621
Well, then let's get some Cristal.

15:00.592 --> 15:01.759
Ah, tasty.

15:01.826 --> 15:02.993
Hit me again.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.003
Hey, I need a bottle
of Cristal for suite 1121.

15:28.377 --> 15:29.844
Casey! Casey, I heard
the safe word.

15:29.912 --> 15:30.812
I think Sarah's
in real trouble.

15:30.879 --> 15:32.580
I got my own problems, Chuck.

15:32.648 --> 15:34.449
Don't be a hero.
Get out of here!

15:46.762 --> 15:49.030
Okay.

15:49.098 --> 15:51.599
This is getting a little
too dangerous for me right now.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.768
Enough games, sweetheart.

15:53.836 --> 15:55.136
Who do you work for?

15:59.041 --> 16:01.042
Hey!

16:01.110 --> 16:02.543
<i>Somebody order room service?</i>
<i>Champagne?</i>

16:05.047 --> 16:06.981
Sarah!

16:07.049 --> 16:08.382
Sarah!

16:21.230 --> 16:23.831
Maybe you should put
your dress on

16:23.899 --> 16:25.032
'cause it's, uh...

16:25.100 --> 16:27.935
a little chilly in here.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.877
Casey, we've got the belt
and Agent Barker,

16:35.944 --> 16:37.011
and we're heading
to the car.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.479
You guys are making
a huge mistake.

16:38.547 --> 16:40.314
You just keep your mouth shut
and we'll deal with you later.

16:40.382 --> 16:42.316
There won't be a later
unless you don't listen to me.

16:42.384 --> 16:43.684
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

16:43.752 --> 16:44.952
Do you think
I'm falling for this?

16:45.020 --> 16:46.087
Trust me, you're
not that charming.

16:50.159 --> 16:51.459
That's not our ride.

16:51.527 --> 16:53.294
Chuck, get down!

16:56.665 --> 16:57.665
Who are they?!

16:57.733 --> 16:59.600
Not ours.
Okay, you stay here.

16:59.668 --> 17:01.335
I'm going to try
and pull fire away from you.

17:01.403 --> 17:03.571
Casey, it's Sarah.
We need help, now!

17:04.573 --> 17:06.174
Sarah! Sarah!

17:08.577 --> 17:10.678
Okay, listen to me clearly.
I'm not a FULCRUM agent.

17:10.746 --> 17:12.747
I'm MI6 working undercover.

17:12.815 --> 17:14.549
Why didn't you say anything before?!
- 'Cause I didn't want

17:14.616 --> 17:16.017
to blow my cover.

17:21.890 --> 17:22.957
How do I know
you're not lying?

17:23.025 --> 17:24.625
You don't, but if you
want her to live,

17:24.693 --> 17:25.926
you don't have a choice.

17:34.102 --> 17:35.703
Do something
or she's already dead.

17:42.477 --> 17:43.978
You better not
be lying to me!

17:49.885 --> 17:52.186
Get down!

18:16.879 --> 18:19.080
Come with me
if you want to live.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.087
You're not going anywhere.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.460
I want to apologize to you directly,

18:32.527 --> 18:33.661
Agent Barker.

18:33.729 --> 18:35.730
We had no record you were MI6.

18:35.797 --> 18:39.400
You people just blew 18 months
of undercover work.

18:39.468 --> 18:41.969
We did recover the stolen
intelligence, didn't we?

18:42.037 --> 18:43.504
I mean it wasn't...
it wasn't a complete loss.

18:43.572 --> 18:45.506
I'm just saying it wasn't
a complete loss.

18:45.574 --> 18:47.942
Whatever information
is on that chip is useless

18:48.010 --> 18:49.644
without the playback device.
- Why?

18:52.881 --> 18:54.181
FULCRUM devised a system

18:54.249 --> 18:56.350
to ensure that
critical information,

18:56.418 --> 18:57.952
if intercepted,
couldn't be read.

18:58.020 --> 18:59.220
My mission was
to bring the chip

18:59.288 --> 19:01.289
to my contact and
find out what's on it.

19:01.356 --> 19:03.124
To do that,
we need the playback device.

19:03.191 --> 19:04.425
I'm ordering you to stay

19:04.493 --> 19:05.993
locked down in Castle tonight,
Agent Barker,

19:06.061 --> 19:07.461
until we speak
to your superiors

19:07.529 --> 19:09.297
and figure out
our next move.

19:09.364 --> 19:11.732
Agent Walker
will stay with you.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.968
Make sure you don't get yourself
into any more trouble.

19:14.970 --> 19:17.071
Well, I could think

19:17.139 --> 19:18.706
of worse ways
to spend the night.

19:18.774 --> 19:20.308
Funny, but I can't think of any.

19:21.510 --> 19:22.543
You could stay at my house

19:22.611 --> 19:23.878
if you wanted to.

19:23.946 --> 19:26.347
My best friend, Morgan,
is sleeping on the sofa.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.182
But I don't think
he'd mind if you were there.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.551
He has a beard... like yours.

19:55.510 --> 19:56.744
What's up, babe?

19:56.812 --> 19:57.778
Couldn't sleep?

19:57.846 --> 19:59.146
I'm worried about Chuck.

19:59.214 --> 20:00.381
I'm afraid I shouldn't
have pushed him

20:00.449 --> 20:01.983
to break up with Sarah.

20:03.352 --> 20:04.585
Well, he's not home.

20:04.653 --> 20:06.020
That's a good sign
if you know what I mean.

20:06.088 --> 20:07.922
Come on, I'll make
you a cup of tea.

20:07.990 --> 20:09.423
It'll help you sleep.

20:15.263 --> 20:16.564
Whoa!
- Ah!

20:16.631 --> 20:18.099
Evening.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.800
Talk about low-hanging fruit.

20:19.868 --> 20:21.502
Oh, my God,
I'm going to kill Chuck.

20:21.570 --> 20:23.537
No, didn't Chuck tell you
I sleep in the buff?

20:23.605 --> 20:25.039
I mean, that's just...
hey, come on.

20:25.107 --> 20:26.273
Big guy,
where are you going?

20:26.341 --> 20:29.010
It's not a big deal, but...

20:29.077 --> 20:30.444
you know what I'm saying.

20:35.817 --> 20:38.753
Right, um, so are you,
are you sure that you're okay

20:38.820 --> 20:40.721
alone with this guy,
'cause I don't mind staying?

20:40.789 --> 20:42.723
Go home, Chuck,
and get some sleep.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.191
I'll see you in the morning.

20:44.259 --> 20:46.093
Okay.

20:47.362 --> 20:48.996
Oh, hey, Chuck?

20:49.064 --> 20:50.064
You got a second?

20:50.132 --> 20:52.033
Uh, yeah, sure.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.970
So, um, what's the deal
with you two?

20:56.038 --> 20:57.238
Us two?

20:57.305 --> 21:00.107
It's, you know,
it's purely professional. Why?

21:00.175 --> 21:01.342
Uh, 'cause she's hot.

21:01.410 --> 21:03.644
Since there's nothing
going on between you,

21:03.712 --> 21:04.945
I'm going to try

21:05.013 --> 21:07.648
and butter that muffin.

21:15.184 --> 21:16.818
Hey. Morning.

21:16.885 --> 21:18.386
Aren't we missing
a houseguest?

21:18.453 --> 21:19.921
Oh.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.322
Honey, honey,
it'll be okay.

21:22.825 --> 21:24.125
Your boy dropped trou
last night.

21:24.193 --> 21:25.293
Excuse me?

21:25.360 --> 21:26.527
Mm-hmm.

21:26.595 --> 21:28.229
The bearded buffoon
sleeps au naturel,

21:28.297 --> 21:30.298
which I respect,
just not on my couch.

21:30.365 --> 21:32.066
Appetite gone.

21:32.134 --> 21:33.868
I am so, so sorry.

21:33.936 --> 21:35.937
Yes, let's, uh...
let's just forget about it.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.305
Did you talk to Sarah?

21:37.372 --> 21:39.373
I did,

21:39.441 --> 21:43.110
and we've decided that
we're just going to be friends.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.645
Oh.

21:44.713 --> 21:46.147
Oh. Oh. Oh, what? What, "Oh?"

21:46.215 --> 21:47.348
Didn't you say that

21:47.416 --> 21:48.716
I should break up with her,
that I needed

21:48.784 --> 21:49.717
to move forward
with my life?

21:49.785 --> 21:50.718
Do you remember saying that?

21:50.786 --> 21:51.886
Yeah, I do.

21:51.954 --> 21:53.187
I do remember saying that.

21:53.255 --> 21:55.523
Um, I just think
that once you let her go,

21:55.591 --> 21:57.658
it's gonna be really hard
to get her back.

21:57.726 --> 21:59.894
Ba-Back? Why would I need
to get her back?

21:59.962 --> 22:01.562
What she means

22:01.630 --> 22:04.232
is that, um,
a babe like her is not going

22:04.299 --> 22:06.200
to be on the market
for long, bro.

22:08.003 --> 22:10.037
Seriously, Chuck,
what were you thinking?

22:28.690 --> 22:29.724
Ah.

22:29.791 --> 22:30.958
Good morning, darling.

22:31.026 --> 22:33.261
How come you never came
to bed last night?

22:33.328 --> 22:35.696
I didn't feel like sleep.

22:35.764 --> 22:37.732
Who said anything
about sleeping?

22:37.799 --> 22:40.534
Let me make this very clear.

22:40.602 --> 22:42.570
I'm not interested.

22:42.638 --> 22:44.405
Me, neither.

22:44.473 --> 22:46.507
I just think your
seduction skills

22:46.575 --> 22:49.777
could use a little work,
and I'm offering my services.

22:49.845 --> 22:51.946
Well, you seemed
pretty reluctant

22:52.014 --> 22:54.215
in your hotel suite
last night.

22:54.283 --> 22:56.117
Well, I didn't want
to blow the cover.

22:58.220 --> 22:59.654
<i>Sarah? Cole?</i>

22:59.721 --> 23:01.555
Cole.

23:11.900 --> 23:13.267
Look, I'm not saying

23:13.335 --> 23:14.769
you don't possess the
necessary instruments.

23:14.836 --> 23:16.370
You've just been a bit
out of practice.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.772
I mean, look at this place.

23:17.839 --> 23:19.440
Locked up in
this dungeon.

23:19.508 --> 23:21.976
It's like keeping a Boticelli
in the basement.

23:22.044 --> 23:24.011
No one can appreciate
the beauty.

23:27.316 --> 23:29.784
Get dressed.

23:29.851 --> 23:32.520
As you wish.

23:38.026 --> 23:39.427
Oh. Impressive.

23:39.494 --> 23:42.196
Uh...

23:44.433 --> 23:45.633
Come here.

23:45.701 --> 23:48.202
What?

23:53.308 --> 23:55.776
I'm gonna think
about it some more.

23:55.844 --> 23:57.979
Next applicant.

24:00.882 --> 24:02.750
<i>So,</i>

24:02.818 --> 24:06.287
my agent says that the salary is
between four and seven figures?

24:06.355 --> 24:08.756
We are not at liberty to
discuss numbers, I'm afraid.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.491
It means it's...

24:10.559 --> 24:12.893
completely negotiable.

24:12.961 --> 24:15.229
Are you not wearing
any underwear?

24:15.297 --> 24:16.764
I don't know. Am I?

24:19.267 --> 24:21.035
I'm confused.

24:21.103 --> 24:22.403
Are you the owners?

24:22.471 --> 24:24.305
No. No, no, no, no, no.

24:24.373 --> 24:25.639
Our acquaintance's mother
is sleeping

24:25.707 --> 24:27.174
with the store manager,
so, basically...

24:27.242 --> 24:29.710
Don't think of us as bosses.

24:29.778 --> 24:33.781
Think of us as bosses
with privileges.

24:35.050 --> 24:37.018
Does your building
have a security

24:37.085 --> 24:38.686
access code?

24:38.754 --> 24:40.888
He's just... Late-night
emergencies are common

24:40.956 --> 24:42.523
in this line of work.

24:44.493 --> 24:46.227
So, if you're looking
for a sales associate,

24:46.294 --> 24:48.462
then why do you need
to hire a swimsuit model?

24:48.530 --> 24:51.699
I nearly have a degree in
business from the El Segundo

24:51.767 --> 24:53.134
School of Finance, so,

24:53.201 --> 24:56.337
some of these concepts
might be over your head.

24:56.405 --> 24:57.705
I have a business degree
from Harvard.

24:57.773 --> 24:59.740
Ah.

24:59.808 --> 25:01.442
Friendly rivalry.

25:01.510 --> 25:02.643
I'm calling my boyfriend.

25:02.711 --> 25:03.377
Oh.

25:03.445 --> 25:04.612
I'm calling the police.

25:06.915 --> 25:08.883
Who's in charge here?

25:08.950 --> 25:10.217
Chuck!
- Chuck!

25:10.285 --> 25:12.486
So, if we can't open it,

25:12.554 --> 25:14.321
how do we get
the playback device?

25:14.389 --> 25:16.190
Well, maybe I can
hack the chip.

25:16.258 --> 25:18.359
I've cracked a data drive
or two in my day.

25:18.427 --> 25:19.860
Not like this.

25:19.928 --> 25:21.729
It's a little more complicated
than you and your friends

25:21.797 --> 25:22.930
stealing video games.

25:22.998 --> 25:24.265
Yeah. Don't try to be a hero

25:24.332 --> 25:26.367
on this one, Bartowski.
Leave that to the pros.

25:26.435 --> 25:27.968
Excuse me. I am a pro.

25:28.036 --> 25:30.071
My job is a certified computer
and electronics technician.

25:30.138 --> 25:31.439
Great cover.

25:31.506 --> 25:33.040
It's not his cover.
It's his life.

25:33.108 --> 25:35.810
Look, the only way we're gonna
read what's on that chip

25:35.877 --> 25:37.044
is if we get the
playback device.

25:37.112 --> 25:38.612
Maybe my cover is still intact.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.748
I'll call my contact
and arrange a new meet.

25:40.816 --> 25:42.516
No. That's too dangerous.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.785
Oh. It's sweet
that you're worried about me,

25:44.853 --> 25:46.153
but I can handle the heat.

25:46.221 --> 25:47.521
It's not
that I'm worried about you.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.290
It's the intelligence
that is on that chip

25:49.357 --> 25:50.324
falling into FULCRUM's hands.

25:50.392 --> 25:52.193
Fine. I'll go without it.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.994
Leave the chip here.

25:54.062 --> 25:55.262
Worst case scenario:
we use this opportunity

25:55.330 --> 25:56.664
to smoke out
a few FULCRUM agents.

25:56.731 --> 25:58.899
Worst case scenario:
they catch you and kill you.

25:58.967 --> 26:00.734
Yeah.

26:00.802 --> 26:03.204
Well, that's a chance
I'm just gonna have to take.

26:12.581 --> 26:14.715
Sarah, give me a chance.
Maybe I can do this.

26:14.783 --> 26:16.350
Chuck, just go back
to the Buy More.

26:16.418 --> 26:17.351
We'll call you
when it's over.

26:20.122 --> 26:22.590
Hey, don't worry, champ.

26:22.657 --> 26:24.625
Lots of other fish
in the sea.

26:24.693 --> 26:26.026
Huh?

26:26.094 --> 26:27.928
And don't get cute
with that chip, Bartowski.

26:29.931 --> 26:32.233
You sure you know
how to handle that?

26:32.300 --> 26:33.734
I think I can manage.

26:33.802 --> 26:34.969
Will you?

26:35.036 --> 26:36.604
Oh, hey, buddy, listen.

26:36.671 --> 26:38.439
I need you to smooth things out
with your sis.

26:38.507 --> 26:39.673
You know, just tell her...

26:39.741 --> 26:41.008
Tell her I'll wear
pajama bottoms.

26:41.076 --> 26:42.476
Not now, Morgan. I'm in
the middle of something.

26:42.544 --> 26:44.245
Hi. Are you Chuck?

26:44.312 --> 26:45.980
Yeah. How can I help you?

26:46.047 --> 26:47.781
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

26:47.849 --> 26:48.883
Oh...

26:52.621 --> 26:53.988
I told Jeff and Lester to hire

26:54.055 --> 26:57.224
the new green shirt, and I guess
they took a few liberties.

26:57.292 --> 26:59.126
I'm sure they did.

27:04.866 --> 27:06.767
My contact is late.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.002
I don't see him anywhere
in this crowd.

27:10.005 --> 27:12.106
Any sign of FULCRUM?

27:12.174 --> 27:13.707
Hard to tell.
They all look the same.

27:27.789 --> 27:29.089
There they are.

27:29.157 --> 27:30.758
We're on.

27:32.260 --> 27:33.661
Signal Sarah when you see
the playback device.

27:33.728 --> 27:35.062
Then we'll move in.

27:36.898 --> 27:37.965
You got the chip?

27:38.033 --> 27:40.367
You got
the playback device?

27:43.338 --> 27:45.739
Someone call
for a professional?

27:47.642 --> 27:49.810
Don't tell me to leave
the spy work to the spies.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.645
I'll show them.

27:58.853 --> 28:00.287
Wait.

28:00.355 --> 28:01.655
Someone just tripped

28:01.723 --> 28:02.723
the homing device
on the microchip.

28:02.791 --> 28:03.757
This guy doesn't have it.

28:03.825 --> 28:05.326
It's coming from Burbank.

28:07.896 --> 28:09.463
It's a setup.
Kill him.

28:10.665 --> 28:12.233
Casey, gun.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.101
Hold your position, Walker.
That's an order.

28:14.169 --> 28:15.703
Cole could be in danger.

28:15.770 --> 28:16.904
He's off the grid.

28:16.972 --> 28:18.272
We're not authorized
to be here.

28:18.340 --> 28:19.807
Get back here.

28:19.874 --> 28:21.108
Drop it.

28:21.176 --> 28:22.076
No, you drop it.

28:23.144 --> 28:24.345
Don't move.

28:30.252 --> 28:31.485
They almost fooled
us until someone

28:31.553 --> 28:33.387
tried to hack
into the real chip.

28:33.455 --> 28:34.955
Bartowski.

28:40.028 --> 28:42.296
And they said
it couldn't be done.

28:42.364 --> 28:44.598
That's when they call in
the real pros, isn't it?

28:54.109 --> 28:55.376
Oh, my... God.

29:15.830 --> 29:17.698
Check it out.

29:17.766 --> 29:19.400
The fuzz.
- Oh, God...

29:19.467 --> 29:21.101
One of those models must've
actually called the cops.

29:21.169 --> 29:22.936
I told you not
to flash them, you perv!

29:23.004 --> 29:24.505
The casting couch
was your idea.

29:25.707 --> 29:27.541
Hi.

29:28.843 --> 29:30.411
Hi.
- Hi.

29:30.478 --> 29:31.412
How can I help you?

29:31.479 --> 29:33.881
Bartowski better lock it down.

29:33.948 --> 29:35.149
Let's get out of here.
Yeah.

29:38.620 --> 29:40.454
That was dumb.

29:40.522 --> 29:44.124
Why do people always insist
on doing things the hard way?

29:44.192 --> 29:47.261
No, no. I assure you,
I, I don't.

29:49.497 --> 29:50.764
What is the hard way?

29:54.502 --> 29:56.203
Oh, my God!
This is unbearable.

29:58.239 --> 30:00.574
My back is killing me;
my wrists

30:00.642 --> 30:02.543
are chafing.
This is going to get ugly.

30:02.610 --> 30:04.111
What level is
his pain tolerance?

30:04.179 --> 30:05.379
I'd say about
a one out of ten.

30:05.447 --> 30:07.915
A what?! A one?

30:07.982 --> 30:10.084
I'd say I'm at least
at an eight.

30:10.151 --> 30:11.819
Chuck, the torture
hasn't started yet.

30:11.886 --> 30:14.421
This is the pre-torture?

30:16.324 --> 30:18.459
Okay, okay.
Put me down for a "one."

30:22.941 --> 30:25.209
Sarah. Sarah.

30:25.277 --> 30:26.611
I saw it.

30:26.678 --> 30:28.779
I know what's on the chip.
- What?

30:30.916 --> 30:32.316
Uh, sorry, mate,
it's a bit difficult

30:32.384 --> 30:34.452
to put my fingers
in my ears right now.

30:34.519 --> 30:35.519
It's okay, Chuck.

30:36.722 --> 30:38.189
I'm on it. It's me.

30:38.257 --> 30:40.891
Okay, we can't let
FULCRUM ever find out.

30:40.959 --> 30:43.027
No matter what they do to you,
you cannot tell them.

30:43.095 --> 30:45.363
I can't...
I can't handle torture, Sarah.

30:45.430 --> 30:46.697
You see all those
syringes over there?

30:46.765 --> 30:47.865
You know how I feel
about needles.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.533
Don't worry
about torture.

30:49.601 --> 30:51.535
I'll incite them.
Get them to kill us quick.

30:51.603 --> 30:53.938
Interesting plan.
- Okay, we just

30:54.006 --> 30:55.606
have to hold out
until Casey gets here.

30:55.674 --> 30:58.175
Until then,  if the pain becomes
unbearable, just pass out.

30:58.243 --> 31:00.011
How?
- Scare yourself.

31:00.078 --> 31:01.479
Shouldn't be too hard.

31:03.915 --> 31:05.883
Glad to see you're all
in such a chatty mood.

31:07.219 --> 31:08.853
The identity
of the Intersect

31:08.920 --> 31:10.388
is on that chip.

31:15.193 --> 31:16.594
So who wants
to tell me first?

31:21.767 --> 31:23.734
Hey!

31:23.802 --> 31:25.469
Ooh, nice suit.

31:25.537 --> 31:26.971
Where you headed,
a funeral?

31:27.039 --> 31:29.640
Yeah, yours if you don't tell me
where Bartowski is.

31:29.708 --> 31:31.776
He got pinched.
- What?!

31:31.843 --> 31:33.978
The cops nabbed him
for indecent exposure.

31:34.046 --> 31:35.546
Guy can't keep it
in his pants.

31:37.082 --> 31:38.215
What cops?

31:38.283 --> 31:39.750
A hot woman,

31:39.818 --> 31:42.420
real taskmaster type.

31:42.487 --> 31:44.188
She can frisk me anytime.
- Shut up, you idiot!

31:44.256 --> 31:45.690
That's how we got in this mess
in the first place.

31:51.630 --> 31:53.731
I would not like to share a cell
with that gentleman.

31:55.734 --> 31:57.301
Stop it. Stop it.
I can't take it anymore.

31:57.369 --> 31:58.235
No more torture.

32:01.473 --> 32:03.007
She's torturing me, idiot.

32:04.176 --> 32:06.510
Tell me who the Intersect is,
Cole...

32:07.579 --> 32:08.913
...and the pain can end.

32:13.251 --> 32:15.586
Sarah, I can't let them do this.

32:15.654 --> 32:17.021
She's going to kill him.
- No,

32:17.089 --> 32:19.457
Chuck, no, just keep
your mouth shut.

32:19.524 --> 32:21.625
Enough, enough, can't you see
he's never going to talk?

32:23.195 --> 32:24.929
Everybody talks.

32:24.996 --> 32:26.230
Cole knows that.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.701
Well, how about it?

32:30.769 --> 32:32.136
You ready to talk

32:32.204 --> 32:33.637
or should I turn
up the heat?

32:41.179 --> 32:43.314
Look, I know what's on the chip.
I watched it.

32:43.382 --> 32:45.483
No, Chuck, no!

32:45.550 --> 32:46.851
It's me.

32:47.986 --> 32:49.887
I'm the one you're looking for.

32:49.955 --> 32:52.790
You?

32:52.858 --> 32:55.626
All along it was you.

33:02.567 --> 33:04.468
Do you really think
the CIA would put

33:04.536 --> 33:06.404
its entire database of
secrets inside his head?

33:06.471 --> 33:07.638
He's a pathetic
weakling.

33:07.706 --> 33:09.473
How could they send him
on an assignment?

33:09.541 --> 33:10.574
How could he even

33:10.642 --> 33:12.643
withstand torture?

33:12.711 --> 33:14.378
It's true, he's just a computer
and electronics technician--

33:14.446 --> 33:16.714
a brave one,
but he's not

33:16.782 --> 33:17.748
the Intersect.

33:17.816 --> 33:19.150
Then who is?

33:19.217 --> 33:20.284
Me.

33:22.587 --> 33:23.888
I'm the Intersect.

33:27.259 --> 33:28.559
No, he's not.

33:28.627 --> 33:29.960
It's me, okay,
and I resent the fact

33:30.028 --> 33:31.028
that I couldn't
stand up to torture.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.363
Do your worst.

33:32.431 --> 33:33.664
In fact, you could stick
that incredibly long needle

33:33.732 --> 33:36.734
in my eye and I still
wouldn't tell you anything.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.104
This needle?

33:40.172 --> 33:41.906
You want me

33:41.973 --> 33:42.973
to put this
needle...

33:44.643 --> 33:46.110
...in your eye?

33:46.178 --> 33:48.846
Uh, uh, uh,
you know, you know, you know,

33:48.914 --> 33:51.215
on, on, on second thought...

33:56.021 --> 33:58.322
Wake him.

34:02.627 --> 34:05.429
General,
we have a situation.

34:05.497 --> 34:07.064
I need surveillance
from a NASA satellite.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.632
What's going on, Agent Casey?

34:08.699 --> 34:11.502
FULCRUM has captured the asset.

34:11.570 --> 34:12.837
I suspect he's being tortured.

34:12.904 --> 34:15.706
Dear God, he'll never last.

34:17.976 --> 34:19.409
It's freezing!

34:19.478 --> 34:21.078
No, no, please, please,
no more torture.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.012
Enough.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.681
We will try...

34:24.748 --> 34:27.284
a different approach.

34:27.351 --> 34:29.386
Tell me who the
Intersect is by three...

34:30.589 --> 34:33.357
...or I inject Agent Walker

34:33.425 --> 34:35.893
with enough ricin
to kill an army.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.962
One, two...

34:38.029 --> 34:39.230
It's me.
- It's me!

34:45.003 --> 34:46.469
Freeze! CIA!
Hands in the air!

34:47.938 --> 34:49.106
Hey, hey.

34:53.078 --> 34:55.545
Hands, now!

34:55.614 --> 34:56.614
Up!

34:58.984 --> 35:00.684
Our turn now.

35:00.752 --> 35:01.986
We get to find
out everything

35:02.053 --> 35:03.554
you know about FULCRUM.

35:03.622 --> 35:05.556
No, you won't.

35:05.624 --> 35:08.759
Trust me, babe,
everyone talks.

35:08.827 --> 35:11.328
I know.

35:11.396 --> 35:12.796
No!

35:22.374 --> 35:25.109
FULCRUM wins.

35:37.088 --> 35:38.389
Thank you.

35:38.456 --> 35:41.258
What happened?

35:42.460 --> 35:44.962
Well, I fainted

35:45.030 --> 35:46.297
and hit my head
on the ground.

35:46.364 --> 35:47.264
Real brave,

35:47.332 --> 35:48.465
Bartowski.

35:48.533 --> 35:50.134
I fainted
on purpose.

35:50.201 --> 35:52.202
That was my move.

35:52.270 --> 35:53.771
You know I'm terrified
of needles.

35:53.838 --> 35:56.440
Oh, so your move
was to faint

35:56.508 --> 35:58.108
and his was
to endure torture?

35:59.711 --> 36:01.345
We have different methods.

36:01.413 --> 36:04.448
It looks like his
method is working.

36:16.858 --> 36:19.360
Keep the ice on that.
- Oh, I'm fine.

36:19.428 --> 36:20.595
I'm really proud
of you, Chuck.

36:20.662 --> 36:22.597
It's not easy to
withstand torture.

36:22.664 --> 36:24.665
Well, they didn't know
the right buttons to push.

36:24.733 --> 36:26.734
I have exceptionally
ticklish toes, you know.

36:26.802 --> 36:29.103
As a child, Ellie was able
to extract information

36:29.171 --> 36:30.538
from me at will.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.473
Well, that's good to know.

36:32.541 --> 36:33.941
Besides, you've had
a lot of practice

36:34.009 --> 36:36.877
enduring torture,
with our fake relationship.

36:41.850 --> 36:44.018
You know, it wasn't
completely torture.

36:44.086 --> 36:46.053
We certainly had our moments,
didn't we?

36:46.121 --> 36:49.190
Well, even though
it wasn't real,

36:49.257 --> 36:50.791
I'm really going to miss it.

36:54.896 --> 36:57.198
Look, maybe I made
an impulsive decision.

36:57.265 --> 36:58.099
Well, I guess

36:58.166 --> 36:59.300
I'd better be heading out.

36:59.368 --> 37:01.202
Chuck...

37:01.269 --> 37:03.104
thanks for risking
your life for me.

37:03.171 --> 37:04.138
Don't ever do it again.

37:04.206 --> 37:05.539
Don't worry.

37:05.607 --> 37:06.507
I won't.

37:11.113 --> 37:13.848
Right, I'll give you two
a couple minutes.

37:17.352 --> 37:20.287
We have to talk
about Chuck.

37:20.355 --> 37:22.223
If you know

37:22.290 --> 37:23.958
who Chuck really is,
then you pose

37:24.026 --> 37:25.292
a security threat.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.961
Someone that
I will have to handle.

37:27.029 --> 37:28.963
Well, I can't say
being handled by you

37:29.031 --> 37:31.232
is an unappealing option.

37:33.268 --> 37:35.803
Understood.

37:35.871 --> 37:38.606
Look, if I've proved anything
to you by now,

37:38.674 --> 37:40.041
it's that I can keep my word.

37:42.778 --> 37:45.146
Feel free to say "no,"

37:45.213 --> 37:46.647
but your government
has sent a fully-loaded G4

37:46.715 --> 37:48.582
to fly me back to London.

37:48.650 --> 37:51.786
I figured same amount of fuel,
we'd go to Fiji.

37:53.488 --> 37:55.222
Sorry. Need to work.

37:55.290 --> 37:56.691
Well, understood.

37:56.758 --> 37:59.160
I'm offering to help you
with your interrogation skills.

37:59.227 --> 38:01.395
Do these lines actually work?

38:01.463 --> 38:02.530
Often.

38:02.597 --> 38:03.831
Okay.

38:03.899 --> 38:06.434
Change of tactic.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.702
The truth.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.137
I really need a vacation,

38:10.205 --> 38:12.139
and it looks like you do, too.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.241
All I can offer you

38:14.309 --> 38:16.610
is some good company,
warm sun,

38:16.678 --> 38:19.380
and lots of wild passion
because the truth is

38:19.448 --> 38:22.149
I think you're a breathtakingly
beautiful woman.

38:34.830 --> 38:37.665
You spend so much time
worrying about someone else,

38:37.733 --> 38:40.101
you've forgotten
about yourself.

38:40.168 --> 38:41.902
I've got work to do.

39:04.126 --> 39:05.259
See you around.

39:05.327 --> 39:06.660
Good-bye.

39:18.340 --> 39:20.441
Hey, Chuck, I was thinking

39:20.509 --> 39:22.676
that, uh, you know,
maybe Ellie seeing me naked

39:22.744 --> 39:24.178
was actually
a blessing in disguise.

39:24.246 --> 39:26.380
Not for her, it wasn't.
- I realize

39:26.448 --> 39:28.315
I need my own place,
somewhere I can sleep naked.

39:28.383 --> 39:29.817
You know, and my

39:29.885 --> 39:31.519
poor, sweet mother isn't

39:31.586 --> 39:33.687
constantly being violated
by my boss.

39:33.755 --> 39:35.422
Yeah, that sounds sensible.

39:35.490 --> 39:37.458
It actually makes perfect sense.
I'm 27 years old

39:37.526 --> 39:38.993
and I live
in the same room

39:39.060 --> 39:41.428
with the same <i>Tron</i> poster
I've had since I was 12.

39:41.496 --> 39:43.664
I just... I need to make
something happen, you know?

39:43.732 --> 39:45.366
Yeah.

39:47.702 --> 39:49.470
Morgan?

39:51.039 --> 39:52.173
Yeah?

39:54.009 --> 39:55.376
Let's move in together.

39:57.579 --> 39:59.046
Tell me you're not joking.

40:00.682 --> 40:02.149
Let's do it, buddy.

40:02.217 --> 40:04.218
I mean, it's time
we both moved on with our lives.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.320
Damn right
it is, buddy.

40:09.658 --> 40:12.693
I've been waiting so long
to hear you say those words.

40:12.761 --> 40:13.861
Bartowski!

40:13.929 --> 40:16.263
How come I got
a machine full of calls

40:16.331 --> 40:18.065
from Human Resources?
Some kind of harassment?

40:18.133 --> 40:20.901
I may have
a couple ideas, sir.

40:20.969 --> 40:22.203
Get in my office!

40:23.371 --> 40:24.705
You think he'll talk?

40:24.773 --> 40:27.174
Everyone talks.

40:49.431 --> 40:51.632
Guys?

40:51.700 --> 40:53.100
Ellie! Awesome!

40:53.168 --> 40:54.268
Can you guys
gather around!

40:54.336 --> 40:55.870
We've got an announcement
to make.

40:55.937 --> 40:57.404
Is it safe?
- Yeah, no, cool,

40:57.472 --> 40:58.472
man, cool, uh...

40:58.540 --> 40:59.773
Fruit stand's closed.

40:59.841 --> 41:01.809
It's okay, babe.

41:01.877 --> 41:04.011
Sorry, it's still
a little fresh.

41:04.079 --> 41:05.546
It'll wear off.

41:05.614 --> 41:07.815
Hey, uh, you want
to do the honors?

41:07.883 --> 41:09.250
Ellie, Awesome,

41:09.317 --> 41:10.618
I have made a very

41:10.685 --> 41:12.887
important decision:
I'm moving out.

41:12.954 --> 41:15.022
Yes!

41:15.090 --> 41:15.923
And moving in with Morgan.

41:15.991 --> 41:18.259
No!

41:18.326 --> 41:20.895
Oh, yeah, video
games and nudity

41:20.962 --> 41:21.996
all day and
all night.

41:22.063 --> 41:24.064
What's up?

41:24.132 --> 41:26.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:26.568 --> 41:28.836
Can I talk to you for a second?
It's kind of important.

41:29.804 --> 41:31.472
Take your time.

41:31.539 --> 41:33.807
Okay.

41:36.311 --> 41:37.611
Talk about your third wheel.

41:40.916 --> 41:43.517
Cole's been captured,
by FULCRUM, we believe.

41:43.585 --> 41:45.152
Oh, my God.

41:45.220 --> 41:46.754
That's terrible.
I'm sorry.

41:46.821 --> 41:48.822
Chuck, he's knows
you're the Intersect.

41:48.890 --> 41:50.891
We have to go
into 24-hour

41:50.959 --> 41:52.493
protective detail
until further notice.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.728
What exactly does that mean?

41:54.796 --> 41:58.098
It means we can't break up,
and we have to move in together.

42:07.108 --> 42:08.876
Well, Ellie's watching.
We better sell it.

42:17.085 --> 42:18.519
Are you sure
about this?

42:18.586 --> 42:20.354
I mean, he's a really tough guy.
Maybe he won't talk.

42:20.422 --> 42:23.791
Chuck, everyone talks.
