WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:12.179
A voyage around the moon
must be made in two phases.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.974
A rocket ship
taking off from the Earth's surface

00:16.058 --> 00:18.519
will use almost all the fuel it will carry

00:18.602 --> 00:22.606
just to attain a speed great enough
to balance the pull of gravity.

00:22.689 --> 00:28.111
Here we have a scale drawing of the Earth
with the moon 240,000 miles away.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.782
This is the elliptical path
which our rocket ship will follow

00:31.865 --> 00:34.493
going out and coming back.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.205
[CAPCOM] And then you will use
its primary system,

00:38.288 --> 00:41.208
the AGS instead of the PGNCS,
for separation and ascent.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.460
Copy all that, Tranquility Base?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.629
[Neil]
Guidance control AGS. Roger, Houston.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.715
[Buzz] We are definitely
concerned about stability

00:48.799 --> 00:51.677
once we fire the ascent engine
from this canted position.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.888
[Neil] In the meantime,
we're losing extra weight.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.143
I don't like the margins, Wernher.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.647
Getting back to vertical's gonna cost him
a lot of ascent fuel.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.108
I mean, they may not be able
to rendezvous with Columbia.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.402
The plan is sound, Gene.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.779
[scoffs]

01:17.244 --> 01:19.329
[CAPCOM]
Tranquility, you have go for liftoff.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.166
Okay, Buzz. Engine Arm on.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.842
Mike, we'll see you in a bit.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.510
Keep our beers cold for us.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.181
[laughs] Copy that, Tranquility Base.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.725
[Buzz] Abort Stage.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.687
-Engine Arm, Ascent.
-Engine Arm, Ascent.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.607
Here goes nothing.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.691
Ignition.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.705
Houston, we're definitely
picking up a little shimmy.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.142
We're leveling out.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.145
The Eagle has wings.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.649
[whooping]

02:35.906 --> 02:38.951
["Street Fighting Man"
by the Rolling Stones plays]

04:16.380 --> 04:18.382
[clock ticking]

04:36.068 --> 04:37.569
Excuse me...

04:38.779 --> 04:41.448
[chattering]

04:41.532 --> 04:42.824
Good morning, sir.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.494
Green suits you, Emma.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.955
Administrator Paine just arrived, sir.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.748
Hope he's got good news.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.834
-Could use that.
-Deke.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.504
I'll catch up.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.932
How much longer do I have to eat shit
before you put me back on flight status?

05:07.015 --> 05:09.268
I've been cooling my heels
for two damn months now.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.395
Look, it's not only up to me.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.021
You pissed off a lot of people.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.235
I'm never going back up, am I?

05:20.445 --> 05:22.406
Not as long as von Braun's director.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.617
I'm sorry. But you made your bed.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.874
So, what the hell am I supposed to do,
just keep pushing paper?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.166
There are worse things.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.501
Yeah, I guess you'd know, wouldn't ya?

05:35.627 --> 05:36.628
Watch it, Ed.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.817
[ticking]

06:19.213 --> 06:21.507
It's from a trusted source in the Kremlin.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.008
And if this is even close to ready...

06:23.091 --> 06:24.468
It's merely blueprints.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.762
I have hundreds of blueprints.
It means nothing.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.765
We can't afford to be cautious now,
Wernher.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.934
This is the new front in the Cold War.

06:32.017 --> 06:35.562
If the Soviets are gonna build
a lunar military outpost up there,

06:35.646 --> 06:38.607
the president wants one too,
and he wants it first.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.942
He can't be serious.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.985
Frankly, I've never seen him more serious.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.947
We're talking a major realignment
of priorities here.

06:45.614 --> 06:50.369
We may have lost the moon, but we can--
We can still win the race for the base.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.079
"Race for the base"?

06:52.538 --> 06:53.539
Catchy, right?

06:54.498 --> 06:55.791
Your testimony before the committee

06:55.874 --> 06:58.794
is the perfect time
to unveil NASA's new strategy.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.254
Beginning with Apollo 12,

07:00.337 --> 07:02.297
we will be scouting for the location

07:02.381 --> 07:05.050
of a permanent military installation
on the moon.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.343
Absolutely not.

07:06.844 --> 07:10.430
We're a scientific program,
not a playground for G.I. Joe.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.975
Wernher. This is a good thing.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.519
Nixon's doubling down on the program.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.563
Our budgets will go up exponentially.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.274
We can bring in three,
four more classes of astronauts.

07:20.899 --> 07:21.900
What do you think, Deke?

07:21.984 --> 07:23.986
Well, I could sure use the extra manpower,

07:24.069 --> 07:26.697
but I don't know,
12's flight is right around the corner.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.908
Yeah. We may need to move that up a tad.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.829
Thomas, listen to me.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.790
We cannot allow this encroachment.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.835
I've seen it before.

07:40.586 --> 07:44.339
My Aggregat 4,
it was designed for low-Earth orbit.

07:44.882 --> 07:50.387
When the Wehrmacht saw its potential,
it became the V-2, a terrible weapon.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.516
We cannot allow space
to become another battlefield.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.601
It already is.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.978
If we don't respond in kind,
we'll be sitting ducks.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.648
I will not watch, yet again,
as my work is defiled by men with guns.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.901
This isn't Germany, Wernher.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.654
Dick Nixon's been fighting communists
for 30 years,

08:08.197 --> 08:10.407
and a red moon isn't something
our nation can accept.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.911
Red moon, blue moon, green moon.
Enough with this nonsense.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.078
This is happening.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.832
I suggest you get on the train
before it runs you over.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.877
[Nixon] Who does he think he is,

08:21.960 --> 08:24.129
to say "no"
to the President of the United States?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.925
If I say put a military base on the moon,
that's it.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.009
End of story.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.303
I want that Kraut bastard gone.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.932
I'm afraid he is quite untouchable,
Mr. President.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.058
A beloved figure...
he taught the country about space travel.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.144
[Nixon] Well, then,

08:39.227 --> 08:41.188
we'll have to get creative now, won't we?

08:44.483 --> 08:46.610
[von Braun]
I miss the barbecue back in Huntsville.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.573
Maybe it's time to retire.
Go back to Alabama.

08:52.658 --> 08:55.619
Yeah. You could sit on your porch.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.746
Smoke your pipe.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.581
Maybe take up painting?

09:00.832 --> 09:04.962
-[laughs]
-Besides, who would I eat lunch with?

09:05.838 --> 09:06.922
I don't know.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.759
-Perhaps a handsome young suitor?
-[groans]

09:10.843 --> 09:13.595
We're doing this again?
You know I don't have time.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.056
Yes. You're a very busy young woman.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.603
I heard about this interview of yours
with Gene.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.649
I was going to tell you. I just wanted--

09:25.732 --> 09:27.985
Wanted to do it yourself. I know.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.031
You worry too much
about what others might think, Margo.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.659
You always have.

09:40.581 --> 09:43.917
[man] The boys couldn't stop talking
about that Apollo 11 landing.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.253
Good old-fashioned controlled crash.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.921
Yeah, Neil's a good stick.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.884
Though I still think
your landing on the Kearsarge,

09:51.967 --> 09:54.761
outta that Dutch roll, takes the cake.

09:56.972 --> 09:59.391
So when you going back up, Ed? 15, right?

10:00.434 --> 10:04.813
Well. It's unclear at the moment.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.441
Sort of why I asked you
to come grab a beer.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.319
I've been thinking about
maybe moving back navy side.

10:10.736 --> 10:11.987
Yeah, right.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.701
Now why on God's green earth
would you wanna do something like that?

10:19.119 --> 10:22.623
Pilots become astronauts, Ed.
Not the other way around.

10:23.457 --> 10:26.126
Well, the only thing
I've been flying lately is a desk.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.087
This about that article?

10:29.880 --> 10:30.923
Yeah.

10:31.381 --> 10:35.052
You always did have a way
of pissing off your superior officers.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.846
Present company included.

10:37.930 --> 10:38.931
[laughs]

10:40.224 --> 10:42.601
But you're also one of the best aviators
I've ever seen.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.728
"One of"?

10:45.521 --> 10:46.855
Don't be a smart-ass.

10:48.273 --> 10:51.193
Navy would just about shit themselves
though to get a guy like you back.

10:51.276 --> 10:54.154
Especially now.
We're making a big push in Vietnam.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.740
Could be the turning point in the war.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.701
And that means commanding a squadron or--

10:59.785 --> 11:00.786
Squadron?

11:01.203 --> 11:03.330
You'd probably get command
of an entire air wing.

11:04.957 --> 11:07.000
And wait till you fly this new Phantom.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.504
Puts those Panthers
we flew in Korea to shame.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.590
It's a fire-breathing beast, Ed.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.390
[Karen] I'm sorry, Ed.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.933
It's just, I can't.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.688
Ed. I can't get another phone call
that your plane was shot down.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.900
I mean, every time the phone rang,
my heart just fell.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.945
I coulda gotten killed
just as easily going up on 10.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.073
Yeah. Well, at least
you weren't being shot at.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.285
It's what I signed up for, Karen.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.331
No, Ed. It's what we signed up for.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.501
Remember?

11:54.631 --> 11:55.799
Oh, my God, would you just--

11:56.758 --> 11:59.344
Cut that out.
You're making a mess of things.

12:00.345 --> 12:04.224
While in Washington, the political fallout
from the Soviet moon landing continues,

12:04.308 --> 12:06.059
as a joint congressional committee
looks deeper

12:06.143 --> 12:08.353
into the alleged failures
of the space program.

12:08.437 --> 12:12.274
Administrator Thomas Paine grilled
by Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts,

12:12.357 --> 12:15.277
who's quickly established himself
as a leading voice on the committee

12:15.360 --> 12:17.404
questioning President Nixon's leadership.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.407
[Kennedy] And how, sir,
do you justify canceling production

12:20.490 --> 12:21.742
of the Saturn V rocket

12:21.825 --> 12:23.827
a full year before Apollo 11?

12:23.911 --> 12:25.370
It was part of a broader--

12:25.871 --> 12:30.417
These were drastic reductions
of NASA's funding by President Nixon.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.295
Excuse me. That's not accurate, Senator.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.547
The president is fully committed
to the space program.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.884
[phone ringing]

12:51.730 --> 12:52.981
Yeah.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.399
[Tracy] Hey.

12:55.776 --> 12:59.029
Where'd you put those vacuum tubes?
TV's fritzing again.

12:59.530 --> 13:00.531
Jesus.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.242
Um... I don't know. Maybe...

13:03.659 --> 13:04.743
What time is it?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.704
Tell me you're not still drunk.

13:08.455 --> 13:13.126
Hey, no, baby, I'm... just beat, is all.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.213
They're really working us down here.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.674
You know I hate
being away from you and the kiddos.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.592
Yeah. I'm sure it's just torture.

13:20.676 --> 13:21.927
[Danny] Mine, give it back!

13:22.469 --> 13:25.556
Hey! Daniel, Jimmy!

13:25.639 --> 13:29.184
Anything you put on that floor,
you will pick up. Are we clear?

13:29.560 --> 13:32.521
Hey, you tell Danny that I said--

13:32.604 --> 13:34.606
[toilet flushes]

13:36.441 --> 13:37.442
Um...

13:41.530 --> 13:45.617
Uh, listen to his mom, yeah.
Tell-Tell him I said that, hon.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.081
Okay.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.168
Guess I'll see you soon.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.003
Hey, Trace.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.922
I love you.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.512
[handset settles in cradle]

14:16.064 --> 14:18.025
[Kranz] Look, I know you're smart, Margo.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.277
But it gets intense down there.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.071
They call it the trench for a reason.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.698
I need to know you're not some pogue

14:24.781 --> 14:26.909
who's gonna wilt
at the first sign of pressure.

14:26.992 --> 14:29.703
No, sir. That wouldn't be--

14:29.786 --> 14:32.664
I've had guys on FIDO, solid guys,

14:33.415 --> 14:36.043
damn near piss their pants
during a rocky re-entry.

14:36.627 --> 14:38.462
Well, sir...

14:39.505 --> 14:40.964
I don't wear pants.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.134
[laughing]

14:44.218 --> 14:45.427
That is a fact.

14:49.223 --> 14:51.642
Dr. von Braun sure thinks
the world of you.

14:52.768 --> 14:54.186
How do you two know each other?

14:54.686 --> 14:57.105
I've known him most of my life, actually.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.359
My father, he taught at the university
over in Huntsville.

15:01.068 --> 15:05.239
Dr. von Braun would come over for dinners
and regale us with stories

15:05.322 --> 15:08.909
about rockets to outer space,
journeys to the moon.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.078
Mars.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.539
I'd never even been outside of Huntsville.

15:14.164 --> 15:17.960
But he made me think
anything was possible.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.295
He's the reason I became an engineer.

15:20.838 --> 15:21.839
Huh.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.883
I'm sorry. Am I rambling?

15:24.967 --> 15:27.094
No. It's nice.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.389
Tell me a bit more about yourself.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.391
What do you do for fun?

15:33.976 --> 15:35.686
Um... I...

15:35.769 --> 15:37.855
Relax. Margo, it's not a test.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.275
Astronauts aren't the only ones
allowed to have fun around here.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.652
But you are not exactly a spring chicken.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.574
I give you this job, you're not gonna
run off on me to start a family, are you?

15:49.283 --> 15:53.120
I don't think kids are in the cards, sir.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.831
Really? You don't want kids?

15:57.207 --> 15:58.792
I mean... uh...

15:58.876 --> 16:01.545
[stammering] it's not that I don't,
it's just, right now--

16:01.628 --> 16:02.796
It's okay.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.382
Not every woman is cut out to be a mother.

16:13.891 --> 16:15.058
[sighs]

16:24.693 --> 16:26.236
[chattering]

16:48.634 --> 16:50.469
[chattering in Spanish]

16:53.096 --> 16:56.016
-[woman yells]
-[chattering, laughing]

17:00.187 --> 17:02.689
[speaking Spanish]

17:04.566 --> 17:05.776
[sighs]

17:07.611 --> 17:08.904
[woman speaking Spanish]

17:08.987 --> 17:10.030
[in Spanish] Seen Aleida?

17:12.906 --> 17:13.992
Aleida.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.743
Papa is home.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.204
Octavio.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.665
I caught her doing it again.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.960
Livi almost burned her hand.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.752
You have to get her under control

17:26.171 --> 17:29.508
or find someplace else to live.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.343
No. No, Cata. Cata, wait.

17:32.427 --> 17:33.554
Where is she?

17:36.265 --> 17:37.266
Aleida!

17:52.406 --> 17:56.159
[in English]
Aleida, you need to stop doing this.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.662
It's dangerous. You know that.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.584
Why do you do it? Talk to me.

18:05.002 --> 18:06.962
[in Spanish] I don't know. I like it.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.714
-English.
-[in Spanish] I don't want to.

18:12.384 --> 18:13.552
[sighs]

18:15.387 --> 18:16.430
Aleida...

18:18.140 --> 18:19.641
you need to talk to me.

18:20.684 --> 18:24.146
Do you remember
how we used to talk all the time?

18:25.689 --> 18:28.734
Look, I know this is hard. I know.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.361
It's a new home, a new country, a--

18:34.114 --> 18:35.532
But we can help each other.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.161
[in Spanish] Just leave me alone.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.985
Oh... Thank God.

19:12.069 --> 19:13.403
[Karen] I'm so glad you called.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.614
How's she doing?

19:15.697 --> 19:16.823
How do you think?

19:17.241 --> 19:18.242
All right. Here.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.326
-Okay.
-Give this to me.

19:19.409 --> 19:20.410
Are you sure?

19:20.494 --> 19:22.329
I will take it from here. You can go.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.956
-All right.
-I'll get it. Thank you, Doris.

19:24.039 --> 19:25.040
Yeah.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.625
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

19:33.841 --> 19:34.842
Trace?

19:36.343 --> 19:37.594
Hon, it's Karen. I--

19:37.678 --> 19:39.304
Don't you dare make excuses for him.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.224
Gordo can stay with that Cape cookie
for all I care.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.851
-Okay.
-I'm not letting him back in this home.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.227
Yes, let's calm down, all right?

19:45.310 --> 19:46.645
I could hear her!

19:47.855 --> 19:49.648
She was in the room with him.

19:50.691 --> 19:54.027
Maybe some of you other wives
can grin and bear it for the program,

19:54.111 --> 19:56.530
but... fuck the program!

20:00.450 --> 20:01.451
Trace...

20:01.535 --> 20:02.911
[sobbing]

20:02.995 --> 20:03.996
...come here.

20:17.426 --> 20:18.594
You know...

20:19.928 --> 20:22.598
I have this fantasy
I'm married to another man.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.642
Yeah?

20:26.143 --> 20:27.561
Yeah, his name's Bert.

20:30.147 --> 20:35.110
He's an accountant, 9:00 to 5:00,
drives a Buick.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.946
Does Bert have a brother?

20:38.614 --> 20:40.490
Come on. Ed's a rock.

20:42.201 --> 20:44.828
Believe you me, being married
to Edward Baldwin is no picnic.

20:46.330 --> 20:47.873
I'm not saying our problems are the same,

20:47.956 --> 20:50.042
but that doesn't mean
we don't have problems.

21:01.303 --> 21:02.346
You know...

21:03.972 --> 21:05.432
I think I always knew.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.102
I was just--

21:12.147 --> 21:16.652
I fooled myself into-- to feeling like a--

21:19.446 --> 21:21.490
Christ, he's not even trying
to hide it anymore.

21:21.573 --> 21:24.701
I do everything for that man, Karen.

21:24.785 --> 21:25.786
I know.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.996
I know it's not easy, I do.

21:30.374 --> 21:31.458
[exhales]

21:32.000 --> 21:33.126
Divorce.

21:35.045 --> 21:37.339
I mean, that's what we're talking about.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.132
That's where this leads.

21:42.636 --> 21:45.097
I mean, it's--
it is hard enough for any woman.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.182
But for women like us, it's--

21:49.685 --> 21:51.311
Do you remember Harriet and Don?

21:51.812 --> 21:54.523
There were reporters
camped out in their front lawn.

21:54.606 --> 21:56.608
Their kids' photos were in magazines.

21:56.692 --> 21:59.528
I mean, Trace,
you gotta think about those things.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.866
You know, I mean,
a divorced single mother of two. I--

22:03.949 --> 22:07.870
How do you support yourself?
I mean, what do you tell your kids?

22:07.953 --> 22:09.079
Your-Your parents?

22:09.872 --> 22:13.584
I mean, you're not just leaving Gordo,
you're leaving your entire life.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.545
I'm sorry. I--

22:18.172 --> 22:20.299
Trace, I want what's best for you, I do.

22:23.760 --> 22:27.472
Look me in the eye
and tell me you don't love him.

22:39.943 --> 22:40.944
Well...

22:44.198 --> 22:45.199
shit.

22:58.337 --> 22:59.338
Margo.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.757
I thought you'd already left for DC.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.051
I am disappointed in you.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.970
Why? What happened?

23:07.387 --> 23:09.598
You've made me look very bad.

23:10.307 --> 23:11.683
I was second to the moon.

23:11.767 --> 23:17.397
And now you, you will be the first woman
in Mission Control.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.778
[exclaims]

23:25.614 --> 23:27.491
You didn't have to convince him, did you?

23:27.574 --> 23:28.909
I did not say a word.

23:29.660 --> 23:33.121
Gene is a smart man.
He could see how talented you are.

23:33.622 --> 23:35.624
No, this is you alone.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.711
No, it wasn't.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.463
Yes.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.175
Well, I...

23:46.802 --> 23:50.347
I've had this for over 20 years.

23:50.430 --> 23:54.935
And now I would like you to have it.

24:05.737 --> 24:07.281
I was hoping for cognac.

24:07.364 --> 24:08.740
[laughs]

24:35.851 --> 24:38.604
[men laughing]

24:40.272 --> 24:41.690
[German accent] Welcome to the trench,

24:41.773 --> 24:43.275
-Eva von Braun!
-Eva von Braun!

24:43.358 --> 24:45.694
[all laughing]

24:46.403 --> 24:49.656
All right, people.
Let's get those handover briefs started.

24:50.324 --> 24:53.035
White Team is on-console in 35 minutes.

24:56.163 --> 24:57.164
[clears throat]

24:59.958 --> 25:01.210
Don't take it personal.

25:01.752 --> 25:03.712
They pull this stuff
with all the new guys.

25:17.059 --> 25:21.522
Feeling like we should, uh,
make a little detour here, Freddie.

25:22.105 --> 25:23.690
Aw, come on, Gordo.

25:24.274 --> 25:26.235
Don't you remember
the ass-chewing we got last time?

25:27.277 --> 25:30.531
Ellington Tower, NASA 963.

25:36.745 --> 25:38.455
[rattling]

25:39.206 --> 25:42.251
Boys, Daddy's home.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.044
[vehicle approaches]

26:08.110 --> 26:09.152
[Gordo] Hello.

26:10.362 --> 26:11.363
Hey.

26:11.446 --> 26:12.489
-Daddy!
-Daddy!

26:12.573 --> 26:13.991
Yeah!

26:14.074 --> 26:16.493
[kissing]

26:16.869 --> 26:19.788
I got you something. I got you this.

26:19.872 --> 26:21.790
It's the biggest
because you're the biggest.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.294
Smelling good, Trace. What you cooking?

26:25.752 --> 26:28.881
It's just some casserole.
Hands off. It's for the barbecue.

26:28.964 --> 26:30.007
-Barbecue?
-Mm-hmm.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.258
All right!

26:36.180 --> 26:37.306
It's good to see you.

26:40.142 --> 26:41.643
-You too.
-Okay.

26:41.727 --> 26:43.103
[timer dings]

26:43.604 --> 26:45.230
-That's the casserole.
-Yeah.

26:47.024 --> 26:48.984
[pounding]

26:50.694 --> 26:54.698
[Frank Sinatra: "Ring-A-Ding-Ding" plays]

26:57.117 --> 26:58.243
Guys.

26:59.828 --> 27:02.039
Hey, you. Glad you could make it.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.916
Yeah, well, wouldn't miss it.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.713
-[Gordo] Come here. Come here!
-He loves those boys.

27:10.756 --> 27:12.841
[man] Yeah, I know.
But this would be great for the...

27:13.717 --> 27:15.302
Come on. Come on over here. Come on--

27:15.385 --> 27:19.223
That's great. Great! That's great.
Up here! Big smiles.

27:19.306 --> 27:21.350
Uh, Buzz, take a bite of the hamburger.

27:23.393 --> 27:25.562
There we go! Nice. Excellent.

27:29.483 --> 27:32.736
I'm just saying,
word is we're putting a base up there.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.196
We wanna be on the crew, Deke.

27:34.279 --> 27:37.741
Guys, drink some beer.
Eat some dogs. Enjoy yourselves.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.081
Her niece just got back from London,

27:44.164 --> 27:48.460
and apparently all the kids over there
were wearing hammer and sickle T-shirts.

27:49.419 --> 27:50.504
Can you imagine?

27:50.587 --> 27:53.757
Karen, I cannot believe
how well you put this all together,

27:53.841 --> 27:55.759
what with all you and Ed
are going through.

27:57.052 --> 27:58.595
Well, we do what we can.

28:00.514 --> 28:03.183
Gordo! Stop it!

28:04.935 --> 28:06.395
You got me all wet.

28:09.189 --> 28:11.608
I wish Harry and me
still had that kind of passion.

28:21.910 --> 28:22.953
[Neil] Ed.

28:29.501 --> 28:30.752
Plotting your escape too?

28:31.670 --> 28:33.130
Yeah. Something like that.

28:36.633 --> 28:37.885
[sighs]

28:43.515 --> 28:47.269
Look, I know you came out here
to get away from all the questions,

28:47.352 --> 28:49.479
but it's still my backyard.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.607
So, spit it out.

28:52.524 --> 28:55.068
Did they really make you
go through customs when you came back?

28:55.152 --> 28:56.153
[chuckles]

28:58.030 --> 28:59.406
I got the receipt to prove it.

28:59.489 --> 29:01.867
Jesus. [laughing]

29:03.493 --> 29:04.620
Ah...

29:08.457 --> 29:12.586
That was... a hell of a landing, Neil.

29:12.669 --> 29:14.213
If you can call it that.

29:16.673 --> 29:18.675
Maintaining attitude control was no joke.

29:18.759 --> 29:19.801
I bet.

29:21.762 --> 29:22.846
Tell you the truth?

29:24.598 --> 29:26.183
I can't believe I didn't abort.

29:26.975 --> 29:28.769
Well, you pulled it off.
It was a good call.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.146
Easy to say that looking back.

29:31.647 --> 29:33.732
Couple things go different,

29:33.815 --> 29:36.068
we drift a little bit further
into those rocks...

29:37.402 --> 29:38.403
we're a smoking hole

29:38.862 --> 29:41.698
and I got my name
on the biggest disaster in NASA history.

29:44.535 --> 29:46.036
Then why'd you go for it?

29:46.119 --> 29:49.414
I don't know. You're in flight test...

29:51.875 --> 29:53.252
and, every once in a while,

29:53.335 --> 29:56.588
you get to that point where
part of your brain is saying, "Eject."

29:57.756 --> 30:00.342
But another part of your brain is saying,
"Go for it."

30:03.595 --> 30:05.264
And you just have to make the call...

30:07.558 --> 30:08.767
and hope you're not wrong.

30:16.149 --> 30:17.234
There he is.

30:17.317 --> 30:19.862
Ed, I want you to meet
Congressman Charles Sandman.

30:19.945 --> 30:23.198
He's on the committee looking at this
whole mess, and he's a big fan of yours.

30:23.282 --> 30:25.409
You know,
before I headed back to Washington,

30:25.492 --> 30:28.245
I told Tom here I had to meet the man
who almost won the moon for us.

30:28.328 --> 30:30.497
I watched Apollo 10 on TV, Commander.

30:30.581 --> 30:34.001
I mean, you boys, you came so damn close.
Must have just about killed you.

30:34.084 --> 30:36.295
Eh, not exactly a secret these days, huh?

30:37.379 --> 30:40.215
You know, I would love for you
to come talk to the committee,

30:40.299 --> 30:41.758
hear what you have to say about all this.

30:43.677 --> 30:46.930
With all due respect, sir,
I think my mouth has done enough damage.

30:47.598 --> 30:48.682
You see?

30:49.558 --> 30:51.643
The fact that you were punished
for speaking the truth...

30:51.727 --> 30:55.063
I mean, if they'd listened to you before,
we wouldn't be in this mess to begin with.

30:55.147 --> 30:56.231
We're at war here.

30:56.732 --> 30:58.567
Well, you, you know what I'm saying,
you're navy.

30:58.650 --> 31:01.111
All you astronauts,
you're all military, aren't you?

31:01.195 --> 31:03.030
Well, technically, yes, sir. But--

31:03.113 --> 31:05.240
They're on loan to NASA.

31:05.991 --> 31:09.244
Still military, but they can't
even wear their uniforms in public.

31:10.204 --> 31:11.705
See? What a disgrace.

31:11.788 --> 31:15.417
That is exactly the kinda ticky-tack crap
that's undermining our fight for the moon.

31:16.460 --> 31:18.420
I know you're not happy, Ed.

31:19.046 --> 31:21.882
And I've spoken with the president.
He's not happy either.

31:22.758 --> 31:25.969
He wants to make some big changes
at the agency, and he needs your help.

31:26.053 --> 31:30.015
Come on up to DC and tell my colleagues
exactly what you told that reporter.

31:30.557 --> 31:32.809
That von Braun is too cautious.
That he cost us the moon.

31:36.230 --> 31:37.773
Uh...

31:37.856 --> 31:38.857
I don't know.

31:41.944 --> 31:46.532
Look, I don't always see eye to eye
with von Braun. But I respect him.

31:47.032 --> 31:49.076
-You know, he built the Saturn V.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:49.159 --> 31:53.163
No, Wernher is a great man.
Don't get me wrong.

31:53.830 --> 31:57.417
But men like him, they don't see the tide
till they're drowning in it.

31:57.501 --> 32:00.879
The president is clear-eyed
about the threat we're facing here.

32:00.963 --> 32:03.423
He thinks astronauts
should be running things.

32:03.507 --> 32:06.301
Men who actually know
what it feels like to be in a dogfight.

32:06.385 --> 32:08.136
You astronauts,
you're holding all the cards.

32:08.220 --> 32:11.598
I mean, hell, you're already the face
of the program. Why not be the voice too?

32:13.016 --> 32:14.893
The president's real keen on this, Ed.

32:15.936 --> 32:17.604
And he remembers his friends.

32:18.438 --> 32:20.357
Could be your ticket back up there.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.525
So, what do you say?

32:35.330 --> 32:38.750
Maybe if you do what they want, things
will go back to the way they were before.

32:40.586 --> 32:41.628
Yeah.

32:42.296 --> 32:43.922
I'd be back on 15...

32:45.048 --> 32:47.176
headed for the Apennine Highlands.

32:49.553 --> 32:51.597
Yeah. No desk duty.

32:53.682 --> 32:54.933
No Vietnam.

33:01.273 --> 33:06.612
You know, you said yourself that
NASA could use a good kick in the rear.

33:07.529 --> 33:08.822
That's true.

33:13.243 --> 33:14.620
But von Braun, he--

33:16.121 --> 33:17.122
he would be...

33:18.749 --> 33:19.917
Yeah.

33:46.235 --> 33:47.778
[chattering]

33:58.789 --> 34:02.125
[Sandman] Now, Commander Baldwin,
if I'm not mistaken...

34:03.377 --> 34:06.630
both Apollo 10 and Apollo 11
lunar modules,

34:06.713 --> 34:09.174
they had almost the same
amount of fuel, correct?

34:09.257 --> 34:10.509
Yes, sir.

34:10.592 --> 34:13.512
A little shy of 18,000 pounds
in the descent stage,

34:13.594 --> 34:14.972
and 5,000 in the ascent.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.599
Okay. Were there any other differences
in the spacecraft?

34:17.683 --> 34:19.351
Anything that would prevent you
from landing.

34:20.393 --> 34:21.728
Well, Snoopy was--

34:21.812 --> 34:24.940
Wait. I'm sorry. Snoopy?

34:26.400 --> 34:28.694
Yes, sir. We named our LEM Snoopy.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.027
[all laugh]

34:30.112 --> 34:33.614
And the command module was Charlie Brown.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.284
[all laughing]

34:35.951 --> 34:37.202
Okay.

34:37.286 --> 34:39.161
Our LEM was heavier than Eagle,

34:39.246 --> 34:44.293
so the concern was whether we'd have
enough thrust to re-enter lunar orbit.

34:45.543 --> 34:46.795
You share in that concern?

34:46.879 --> 34:49.547
Well, it-it wasn't
within NASA's safety margins.

34:50.299 --> 34:51.300
Uh-huh.

34:51.382 --> 34:55.637
You were a naval test pilot,
were you not, Commander? At Pax River.

34:56.388 --> 34:57.389
I was, sir.

34:57.472 --> 35:00.767
And when was playing it safe
part of being a test pilot?

35:02.394 --> 35:03.395
Never, sir.

35:04.688 --> 35:08.775
You pushed and you pushed for Apollo 10
to land on the moon, didn't you?

35:08.859 --> 35:12.487
Well, during planning, yes, sir.
I pushed for us to land.

35:12.571 --> 35:15.407
And you were overruled
by Wernher von Braun.

35:15.866 --> 35:17.910
Well, it was ultimately his decision

35:17.993 --> 35:22.039
to view Apollo 10 as a trial run for 11.

35:22.456 --> 35:23.916
But were it not for him,

35:24.291 --> 35:27.252
you would've been the first man
to set foot on the moon, right?

35:38.222 --> 35:39.264
Hmm?

35:40.182 --> 35:42.017
It's not that simple, sir.

35:45.938 --> 35:47.731
It's not-- I'm sorry?

35:50.025 --> 35:53.654
Well, it's true von Braun made the call
on the ground, but...

35:56.740 --> 35:58.492
when we were up in lunar orbit...

36:00.035 --> 36:02.955
I knew I could bring the LEM
safely down to the surface.

36:12.172 --> 36:13.590
I mean, we were so close.

36:14.132 --> 36:18.178
Snoopy, Houston. We put you
one minute ahead of the timeline.

36:18.554 --> 36:20.889
Take a minute
and enjoy the view, gentlemen.

36:20.973 --> 36:24.226
Roger that, Houston.
We got the best seat in the house.

36:26.228 --> 36:29.898
[Baldwin] All I had to do was
hit Engine Arm, Descent...

36:31.233 --> 36:33.235
let the burn run
all the way to completion.

36:33.986 --> 36:36.321
Except that wasn't your mission,
Commander.

36:36.405 --> 36:39.491
I mean, von Braun, you know,
he made it very clear that that was not--

36:39.575 --> 36:42.703
After launch, it's my ship to command.

36:45.497 --> 36:47.749
There's boulders
in every one of those little--

36:48.959 --> 36:50.669
little craters. You see that?

36:50.752 --> 36:51.962
On the ridge.

36:52.504 --> 36:56.550
Boulders are black, but whatever's
ejected out of them is white.

36:56.633 --> 37:00.971
White, but...
still some black around them.

37:01.471 --> 37:04.433
It almost looks windblown
down there, right?

37:04.516 --> 37:05.559
Uh-huh.

37:06.852 --> 37:07.978
What a place.

37:10.397 --> 37:12.149
Snoopy, Houston.

37:12.232 --> 37:15.527
Hate to rain on your parade,
but that's as close as you get this trip.

37:15.611 --> 37:16.945
Time to head for the barn.

37:17.446 --> 37:19.072
Roger that.

37:19.156 --> 37:20.490
Heading for the barn.

37:21.116 --> 37:25.704
I wanna just reach down there
and scoop up a handful of moon dust.

37:29.041 --> 37:31.376
Engine Arm, Ascent.

37:31.460 --> 37:33.128
Engine Arm, Ascent.

37:33.754 --> 37:35.672
Abort Descent Stage.

37:36.798 --> 37:39.718
Three, two, one...

37:45.724 --> 37:46.850
[Gordo] Skipper?

37:50.562 --> 37:52.272
[Baldwin]
And if I would've said we can land,

37:52.356 --> 37:54.316
I knew Gene would've backed me.

37:54.942 --> 37:56.693
Just like he backed Neil on 11.

38:01.990 --> 38:03.617
It was maybe a few seconds...

38:07.329 --> 38:09.998
but I knew I could've flown her
right down to the deck.

38:24.054 --> 38:25.806
Abort Descent Stage.

38:25.889 --> 38:28.934
Three, two, one...

38:42.406 --> 38:43.574
And I almost did.

38:49.955 --> 38:51.665
But I pulled back.

38:53.917 --> 38:55.335
And it was my call...

38:57.004 --> 38:58.213
no one else's.

38:59.506 --> 39:03.135
[people murmuring]

39:10.934 --> 39:12.603
[stammering] Hang on, now.

39:12.686 --> 39:14.313
You-You said--

39:14.396 --> 39:16.106
Just hang on a minute.

39:17.232 --> 39:18.525
You said-- Here! Right here.

39:18.609 --> 39:23.530
You said, "We don't have guts at NASA
anymore. That's why we lost the moon."

39:24.072 --> 39:25.240
Now what are you saying?

39:25.324 --> 39:28.118
Now you're saying,
"I could've landed. I just didn't"?

39:31.288 --> 39:33.123
I think about it every day, sir.

39:33.957 --> 39:35.792
Whether it was the right call or not.

39:37.252 --> 39:40.297
Ten years ago when I was in flight test,

39:41.173 --> 39:42.716
maybe I would've said, "Hell with it."

39:44.134 --> 39:45.135
Brought the LEM down.

39:45.219 --> 39:51.183
But up there I wasn't just some test pilot
trying to break another record.

39:54.394 --> 39:56.271
I was the commander of Apollo 10.

40:00.817 --> 40:03.362
So if this committee
is looking for someone to blame...

40:04.571 --> 40:09.159
don't look to von Braun or Neil
or anyone else.

40:11.078 --> 40:12.287
You look to me.

40:15.165 --> 40:16.458
I lost the moon.

40:28.053 --> 40:29.096
Right.

40:29.179 --> 40:31.598
Thank you, Commander.
That'll be all for today. Thank you.

40:32.558 --> 40:33.767
Thank you, everyone.

40:33.851 --> 40:37.062
[chattering]

40:54.162 --> 40:58.500
The new rocket can carry
over one million pounds into Earth orbit.

40:58.584 --> 41:01.795
Nearly four times
the payload of the Saturn V.

41:03.630 --> 41:04.882
This is possible...

41:04.965 --> 41:06.550
So you just weren't gonna tell me?

41:10.554 --> 41:13.390
-What do you want me to say, Gordo?
-It wasn't just your decision to make, Ed.

41:13.473 --> 41:14.683
I was up there too.

41:17.102 --> 41:19.438
Did it ever even occur to you
to ask me what I thought?

41:19.813 --> 41:21.648
Pushing the envelope.
That's what all this is about.

41:21.732 --> 41:23.442
Or did you just forget that?

41:23.859 --> 41:26.778
Right now it should be you and me
doing all these ticker tape parades.

41:26.862 --> 41:29.323
Instead I'm backing up Pete Conrad on 12.

41:30.616 --> 41:33.368
Hey, don't blame every bad decision
you've ever made on me.

41:34.119 --> 41:36.038
'Cause you do enough damage yourself.

41:36.121 --> 41:39.583
What do you think it says
when you wander into sim an hour late

41:39.666 --> 41:41.418
just reeking of booze and pussy?

41:41.502 --> 41:43.587
That the American dream is alive and well.

41:44.588 --> 41:46.965
Yeah. Everything's
a goddamn joke to you, huh?

41:50.677 --> 41:52.262
At least I own what I did.

41:52.763 --> 41:54.431
And what the hell's that supposed to mean?

41:55.390 --> 41:56.475
I resigned.

41:59.061 --> 42:00.270
I'm going back to the navy.

42:01.188 --> 42:02.272
You for real?

42:06.860 --> 42:09.279
What are you doing drinking beer?

42:09.363 --> 42:11.073
-Hey, Pam.
-Hmm?

42:12.115 --> 42:13.659
We're gonna need a couple of whiskeys.

42:22.251 --> 42:23.377
All right, all right, all right.

42:23.460 --> 42:27.965
NASA will be pressing forward.
Pursuing more ambitious projects.

42:28.048 --> 42:29.883
Journeys to Mars, to Jupiter,

42:29.967 --> 42:34.096
and perhaps,
even deeper into the solar system.

42:34.179 --> 42:37.432
[Sandman] Right, yeah. That's a very
impressive presentation, Director.

42:37.891 --> 42:40.269
But while we sit here,

42:40.894 --> 42:42.271
the Soviets are pushing ahead

42:42.354 --> 42:45.649
with their plans
for a lunar military foothold.

42:45.732 --> 42:48.735
We cannot cede the beachhead!

42:49.528 --> 42:51.363
I mean, it's not a time
for pie in the sky ideas

42:51.446 --> 42:52.823
about Mars and the solar system--

42:52.906 --> 42:56.451
Respectfully, Congressman.
Now is precisely the time.

42:56.535 --> 42:59.371
We cannot allow fear to drive us
from our purpose.

42:59.454 --> 43:02.249
What we are seeking
is the key to our future.

43:02.875 --> 43:05.002
We are expanding the mind of man.

43:05.085 --> 43:09.423
Extending this God-given brain and these
God-given hands to their outermost limits.

43:09.506 --> 43:13.385
And in so doing,
everyone will reap the harvest.

43:13.468 --> 43:14.469
He's good.

43:14.928 --> 43:18.015
[Sandman] Well, for someone who claims
not be guided by fear,

43:18.098 --> 43:23.312
your leadership created a culture
of caution after the Apollo 1 fire, right?

43:23.395 --> 43:26.148
[von Braun]
Yes, of course. We were more cautious.

43:26.648 --> 43:28.233
Lives were lost.

43:28.317 --> 43:31.528
We test, we retest, and we prepare.

43:31.612 --> 43:32.988
Because, unlike the Soviets,

43:33.447 --> 43:35.824
we care about the lives of our astronauts.

43:35.908 --> 43:40.621
You must understand, Congressman,
that this is not the end of the race.

43:41.079 --> 43:42.456
It's simply the first stage.

43:42.539 --> 43:45.334
We must keep our eyes to the future.

43:45.417 --> 43:48.045
As Mr. Armstrong so aptly put it,

43:48.128 --> 43:50.380
"We pick ourselves up
and go back to work."

43:51.215 --> 43:53.634
-Well, if you had-- If you--
-[applauding]

43:59.306 --> 44:00.307
Come here.

44:01.308 --> 44:02.684
[inaudible]

44:04.394 --> 44:07.064
Okay. Sorry. Just one more thing,
Director. [heavy sigh]

44:07.147 --> 44:10.692
Now, you're such a familiar face
to Americans.

44:10.776 --> 44:13.028
Honestly, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were born in Alabama.

44:13.111 --> 44:16.031
Unfortunately my accent gives me away,
Congressman.

44:16.114 --> 44:18.075
[all laughing]

44:20.911 --> 44:23.497
And most people know
that during World War II,

44:23.997 --> 44:25.958
you built the German V-2 rocket...

44:27.167 --> 44:30.003
that killed thousands
of innocent Londoners.

44:32.840 --> 44:36.093
Well... [sighs] I, of course...

44:37.427 --> 44:39.888
have great regret that my rockets,

44:39.972 --> 44:45.477
which were born of idealism,
much like the Saturn V,

44:46.270 --> 44:48.564
had joined in the business of killing.

44:48.647 --> 44:52.192
Then why--
why didn't you stop manufacturing it?

44:54.236 --> 44:56.405
[Kennedy] If I may, Mr. Chairman,

44:56.488 --> 44:59.491
I'm not sure how any of this
is relevant to the hearing.

44:59.575 --> 45:00.576
There is--

45:00.659 --> 45:04.162
Congressman, I was not a soldier,
merely an engineer.

45:04.955 --> 45:06.415
Well, that's interesting.

45:07.541 --> 45:09.960
Because what most people don't know,

45:11.003 --> 45:12.212
since, until very recently,

45:12.296 --> 45:14.298
it was classified
as part of Operation Paperclip,

45:14.381 --> 45:16.466
is that you were also a member

45:16.550 --> 45:19.511
of the elite Nazi organization
known as the SS.

45:24.349 --> 45:27.186
That was a matter
in which I had no choice.

45:28.729 --> 45:32.274
Not everybody gets invited
to a photo op with the Führer.

45:33.317 --> 45:36.653
Dr. von Braun, only a few minutes ago,

45:37.154 --> 45:40.490
you stated that, uh,

45:40.574 --> 45:44.536
"We care about the lives
of our astronauts."

45:44.620 --> 45:45.704
Yes.

45:45.787 --> 45:48.749
And what about the lives of the workers
from the Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp

45:48.832 --> 45:50.375
that were, in fact, building your rockets?

45:50.459 --> 45:52.211
Do you care about their lives?

45:52.294 --> 45:55.631
I saw no camp
or any sort of thing like this--

45:55.714 --> 45:59.051
[Sandman] You did visit the Mittelwerk
factory, yeah, quite a few times.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.678
I visited the factory, yes.

46:01.762 --> 46:04.556
Did you not wonder
where all these workers came from?

46:04.640 --> 46:07.184
I didn't know. This was handled by others.

46:07.267 --> 46:10.103
You must understand
that I had no real authority in--

46:10.187 --> 46:13.440
I'm sorry. Are you saying you had
no authority over your own rocket factory?

46:14.024 --> 46:17.611
Well, yes.
I had authority insomuch as I was chief--

46:17.694 --> 46:21.156
But I never worked there.
I had only visited.

46:21.240 --> 46:24.743
The camp was less than half a mile

46:24.826 --> 46:27.037
from the factory
where you made your rockets.

46:27.829 --> 46:30.374
So, how could you not know?

46:35.629 --> 46:40.801
You know, over 20,000 men and women
died building your V-2.

46:41.927 --> 46:45.305
Ten times more
than were killed by it as a weapon.

46:46.265 --> 46:48.267
They were worked to death,

46:48.350 --> 46:52.312

It was an ambush.

is it true?

we gathered everything...

50:42.292 --> 50:44.711
