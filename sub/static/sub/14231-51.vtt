Is he ever going to
speak to us again, Mommy?

01:17.660 --> 01:19.245
Oh, don't worry, baby.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.164
This is the last game
of the season.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.333
As soon as it's over,
he's all ours,

01:23.416 --> 01:24.876
whether he likes it or not.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.294
Ah, come on, mom.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.129
He doesn't
even know we're alive

01:28.213 --> 01:29.798
if the football game's on.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.966
Don't be silly, PJ.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.135
We're always on
your father's mind.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.681
Peg! Where are my
wiener doodle cheese melts?

01:37.764 --> 01:38.765
See?

01:40.684 --> 01:43.770
So what kind of
a weak-kneed, slack-bellied,

01:43.853 --> 01:46.106
snack-slobbering man are you?

01:46.189 --> 01:47.941
Sitting around getting fat

01:48.024 --> 01:50.193
while the world
passes you by?

01:50.276 --> 01:53.863
Oh, mama! Not you again!

01:53.947 --> 01:56.324
You're nothing
without a sports car

01:56.408 --> 01:59.119
from Tan Roadster.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.539
A muscle machine
for a muscle man.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.082
Right, girls?

02:04.165 --> 02:06.501
You're always right, Tan.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.670
Here you go, baby fat.

[gobbling]

[slurp]

02:13.174 --> 02:16.511
Ahhh. Here.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.972
Uhh! Excuse me.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.473
I can't recall hearing

02:20.557 --> 02:22.434
any expression of gratitude.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.145
[burp]

02:25.228 --> 02:27.647
I'm sorry.
A belch won't do.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.738
Ooh-ahhh.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.657
Well, I suppose that's
better than being ignored.

02:37.741 --> 02:41.745
Oh, honey, those were
the best doodles I...

02:41.828 --> 02:42.996
Move! Out of the way!

02:44.039 --> 02:45.832
Well, since it's
the last game,

02:45.915 --> 02:47.083
I'll let him live.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.544
C'mon, c'mon! C'mon! Yes!

02:49.627 --> 02:52.047
Touchdown!
Whooooh! We won!

02:52.130 --> 02:53.840
Ha ha ha ha ha!

02:53.923 --> 02:55.342
What the... Peg!

02:55.425 --> 02:56.885
There someone at the door.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.138
Oh, drat. I've got to do
everything around here.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.182
Ah-hyuck. Hiya, Petey.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.352
We ain't buying nothin'
from nobody, see?

03:05.435 --> 03:07.937
Not a very warm reception.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.357
You can say
that again.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.777
Hey, what's the big idea?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.695
I can't see! See?

03:15.779 --> 03:17.947
Peter, dear, you promised

03:18.031 --> 03:20.075
that after the last
football game of the season,

03:20.158 --> 03:22.035
you'd take us all
to mount ladle

03:22.118 --> 03:24.287
for fun and sun in the snow.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.872
[Pistol] We have killer snowballs,

03:25.955 --> 03:28.208
and we're not afraid to use 'em.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.252
Aw, but... but
the instant replays,

03:31.336 --> 03:34.756
the pre-post game, the post-pre game,
the wrap-ups,

03:34.839 --> 03:36.925
America's favorite
sports injuries...

03:37.008 --> 03:40.178
Hoo! Aah! Hey!
Aah! No fair!

03:40.261 --> 03:44.391
Awk! Hey!
I have a good idea!

03:44.474 --> 03:47.644
Why don't we
go to Mount Ladle?

03:47.727 --> 03:49.813
-Hey!
-Yay!

03:56.903 --> 03:58.321
Pete! Doll!

04:00.073 --> 04:02.534
I'm trying to get out of...

04:03.910 --> 04:05.245
I'm stuck!

04:05.328 --> 04:07.831
I'm not buying it,
sugar buns.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.458
Wha-wha-whaddaya
gonna do?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.794
Uh, Peg?
Mousse pie, wait!

04:12.877 --> 04:14.045
Stop! Ow!

04:14.129 --> 04:16.047
[straining] Uhh!

04:16.131 --> 04:17.841
Oow! Oow! Oow!

04:17.924 --> 04:19.467
Whaaaa!

04:19.551 --> 04:20.510
Ah!

04:20.593 --> 04:21.553
Aah!

04:24.514 --> 04:25.765
[Pete shouting]

04:25.849 --> 04:27.434
Help! No! Stop!

04:27.517 --> 04:28.518
Whaa! Hah! Ow!

04:28.601 --> 04:30.687
What are you trying to...

04:30.770 --> 04:34.983
I just don't know how
I could get stuck here.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.111
I've been betrayed
by my favorite recliner.

04:38.194 --> 04:41.031
I think it was
those last wiener doodles

04:41.114 --> 04:42.407
that betrayed you,
love handles.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.909
And that tub of pork rinds.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.829
Yeah. And that 12-pack
of burritos.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.330
And jalapeño fudge sundaes

04:49.414 --> 04:51.041
and double-dipped
chocolate pig's feet

04:51.124 --> 04:52.250
and whipped cream nachos.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.918
And brown sugar blintzes

04:54.002 --> 04:55.503
and French-fried
Swedish meatballs

04:55.587 --> 04:57.714
and pork tartare
and Vienna sausage...

04:57.797 --> 04:59.966
All right, all right!
Thanks for sharing.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.886
A football fan's gotta keep
his strength up, you know.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.013
Gawrsh, Pete,
it sounds to me

05:05.096 --> 05:06.931
like you might've
put on a ton or two.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.391
Are you crazy? I...

05:08.475 --> 05:10.060
[stomach rumbles]

05:10.143 --> 05:11.519
Little old me?

05:11.603 --> 05:13.355
Why, it's all muscle.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.858
I ain't fat.
I'm just big-boned.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.527
Yes. Especially your head.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.321
All right,
now stop talking crazy.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.073
Get me out of this
man-eating chair.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.408
My sitter's getting numb.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.410
Ah-hyuck! Numb or not,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.079
it's hangin' on
to that there chair

05:29.162 --> 05:31.498
like a tow truck
to a bumper.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.583
Now that gives me an idea.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.836
[Goofy] Okey-doke, Peg!

05:36.920 --> 05:38.338
We're all set out here!

05:38.421 --> 05:39.631
Thank you, Goofy!

05:39.714 --> 05:41.841
Wait till I give the word!

05:41.925 --> 05:43.593
All set, Mrs. P.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.679
Yeah. This is a great idea, mom.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.806
Um, pumpkin,

05:47.889 --> 05:50.517
it's only my personal
opinion, you understand,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.811
but I don't think
this is gonna work.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.021
Oh, stop it, Peter.

05:55.105 --> 05:58.650
That kind of negative attitude
never accomplishes anything.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.194
All right.
Then I'm positive

06:01.277 --> 06:02.487
this isn't gonna work.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.947
Ha ha ha!

06:04.030 --> 06:06.533
You're incorrigible!

06:06.616 --> 06:08.076
Now suck in
your back pockets

06:08.159 --> 06:10.078
and get ready.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.414
Can I tell Mr. G., Mama?
Please, can I?

06:12.497 --> 06:13.707
Please, please, Mama, Mama?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.417
Of course you can, sweetheart.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.294
Peg, ha ha.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.463
Can't we talk this over?

06:20.547 --> 06:24.050
OK, Mr. G., take it away!

06:25.552 --> 06:27.721
Oh, why didn't we think
of this right away?

06:27.804 --> 06:29.848
[chuckling]

06:29.931 --> 06:32.434
Ow! Yeow! Aah!

06:32.517 --> 06:34.769
Help! Leggo! Stop!

06:34.853 --> 06:38.356
You know,
Pete might've been right.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.320
[Peg] Pete, I think you really
have got to lose some weight.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.655
[Pete] Don't be silly.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.115
That chair was defective.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.616
You must have gotten it

06:48.700 --> 06:50.452
at the same place
you got this RV.

06:50.535 --> 06:54.372
Don't be ridiculous!

06:54.456 --> 06:58.335
Well, here we are.
Now what?

06:58.418 --> 07:01.421
Now we have some fun!
Right, kids?

07:01.504 --> 07:02.922
-Awesome!
-All right!

07:03.006 --> 07:04.758
-I'm gonna ski!
-I'm gonna skate!

07:04.841 --> 07:06.301
[PJ] All right!

07:06.384 --> 07:07.927
[sniffing] Hmm.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.637
Smells like they're
cooking up something good

07:09.721 --> 07:11.222
at the lodge.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.600
Pete! We didn't
come here to eat!

07:13.683 --> 07:16.394
Speak for yourself,
egg roll. Ha ha ha!

07:16.478 --> 07:18.146
Goofy, I'm worried.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.190
That man has got
to get some exercise.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.650
-He's too fat!
-Relax, Peg.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.819
When he sees
how much fun I'm havin',

07:24.903 --> 07:28.698
he'll fall over himself
to join me. Ah-hyuck!

07:28.782 --> 07:32.077
Oh, I wish he'd phrased
that differently.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.913
[Pete humming]

07:39.459 --> 07:43.046
Hmm. This wasn't such
a bad idea after all.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.758
Ahem!

07:46.841 --> 07:49.386
Excusez mio.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.930
Hey! Mind giving me
some elbow room?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.058
-Ugh!
-Ohh!

08:02.524 --> 08:04.776
Mmm! Well! Ahh!

08:04.859 --> 08:07.195
If anyone wants
quality time,

08:07.278 --> 08:10.115
I'll be taking a nap
in the old RV.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.370
[sputtering]

08:15.787 --> 08:18.081
Tan Roadster!

08:18.164 --> 08:20.375
Well, well, well.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.419
If it ain't my old buddy Pete.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.421
How are the RVs doing, huh?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.755
Ha ha ha!

08:25.839 --> 08:28.758
Oh, man, can you
still fit in one?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.343
Ha! That's cute.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.013
How are your little
go-carts, Tan?

08:33.138 --> 08:36.307
Don't they crush under the weight
of your inflated ego?

08:36.391 --> 08:39.477
At least I won't be
harpooned by accident.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.147
If I didn't have
my good socks on right now,

08:42.230 --> 08:44.399
I'd punch your lights out!
Ow!

08:44.482 --> 08:46.860
Fat chance, Pete.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.237
Ow!

08:49.320 --> 08:51.197
[Tan laughing]

08:51.281 --> 08:52.824
Oh, yes.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.747
Yeow!

08:58.830 --> 09:01.332
What a firecracker!

09:01.416 --> 09:03.043
Button your lip, Romeo,

09:03.126 --> 09:05.086
or I'll blow up
in your face!

09:05.170 --> 09:08.381
Baby, you are my kind of woman.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.383
Hey! Leave my wife alone!

09:10.467 --> 09:14.054
Your wife? What can
this woman see in you

09:14.137 --> 09:16.514
besides way too much Pete?

09:16.598 --> 09:18.767
There is a lot of him,
but he's all mine.

09:18.850 --> 09:22.270
She knows a real man
when she sees one.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.981
Then she should come
to the Mount Ladle Winter Games

09:25.065 --> 09:27.025
and see me in action.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.027
The only reason she'd do that

09:29.110 --> 09:32.614
would be to see yours truly
make you look like a spud.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.532
Pete.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.076
It's a deal.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.494
We'll see who she's
impressed with

09:37.577 --> 09:39.454
after we comPete
in the games, buddy.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.791
You got it... ow!

09:42.874 --> 09:46.670
I said you needed exercise,
but the winter games?

09:46.753 --> 09:50.757
Wow, Petey! This is gonna
be something to see!

09:51.800 --> 09:53.051
Yeah.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.682
[Pete] What have I done?

09:58.765 --> 10:02.102
Don't worry, sugarplum.
I'm putting you on a diet.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.770
What?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.522
You want to win the winter
games, don't you?

10:05.605 --> 10:09.526
But, sugar cookie,
Petey's hungry.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.778
Then get out of the kitchen

10:11.861 --> 10:13.530
and find something
to keep busy.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.413
Hmm...

10:21.496 --> 10:24.207
This oughta keep me busy.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.046
"To my sweet, sassy Peg,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.256
love Tan,

10:31.339 --> 10:34.926
your lean,
muscular millionaire.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.928
[growling]

10:37.012 --> 10:38.847
I gotta get my mind
off of food.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.932
Maybe some TV will help.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.268
Uh...

10:43.351 --> 10:45.437
I better sit down.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.030
I gotta get outta here!

10:55.113 --> 10:56.614
[panting]

11:00.827 --> 11:03.788
Peg, have I lost
any weight yet?

11:03.872 --> 11:05.206
Uh...

11:05.290 --> 11:06.958
You've gained 1 ounce.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.001
Gained?

11:08.084 --> 11:09.627
Well, pudding pop,

11:09.711 --> 11:12.130
you've only been on the diet
for two minutes.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.256
2 1/2.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.883
If you want to lose weight,

11:14.966 --> 11:17.927
try getting a little exercise.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.479
Just do it.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.239
What's this, Daddy?

11:38.323 --> 11:39.491
Aah!

11:44.162 --> 11:46.581
Oh, I'm so happy, Goofy.

11:46.664 --> 11:50.043
Now if I can just keep Pete mad enough
at that roadster creep

11:50.126 --> 11:52.003
to do himself some good.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.797
Shh! Here he comes.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.132
[humming]

11:56.216 --> 11:59.386
Oh, hiya, Petey.
You're doin' swell.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.221
Yeah, sure.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.481
Oh, hello, Peter.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.318
I'm gonna whip
Tan's money-coated hide!

12:15.402 --> 12:18.321
[Peg] Ha ha ha! Oh, Petey.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.492
Tan can't buy my heart
with chocolates and roses.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.993
Hee hee hee! Well,

12:24.077 --> 12:26.413
of course he can't.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.833
However, a convertible
in candy apple red...

12:31.292 --> 12:32.544
Goof, you gotta help me.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.212
I gotta lose weight,

12:34.295 --> 12:35.547
or I'll lose the Mount Ladle
Winter Games

12:35.630 --> 12:37.465
and I'll lose my wife!

12:37.549 --> 12:41.886
All right. Ah-hyuck!
I got me a plan.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.513
[Pete] Okay, we're at the gym.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.765
So what's your plan?

12:45.849 --> 12:47.684
Hyuck! It's all
right in here...

12:47.767 --> 12:50.520
My how-to book of fitness.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.982
[sigh] I must be
Goofier than he is.

12:54.065 --> 12:57.777
[Narrator] Jumping rope is
the perfect warmup exercise

12:57.861 --> 13:01.948
and leads to excellent
cardiovascular fitness.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.450
Hey! Ah-hyuck!

13:03.533 --> 13:05.326
Once you get the hang of it,

13:05.410 --> 13:08.204
some fancy footwork
can make it fun.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.873
Hmmph!

13:14.002 --> 13:15.211
Okey-doke.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.755
Ah-hyuck!

13:16.838 --> 13:18.256
[humming]

13:22.260 --> 13:23.595
Yee-haw!

13:23.678 --> 13:26.389
[humming]

13:32.062 --> 13:34.647
Gawrsh, Pete.
Fitness is fun!

13:34.731 --> 13:36.358
Ah-hyuck!

13:36.441 --> 13:38.985
Ah, weight training.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.237
To achieve
an effective workout,

13:41.321 --> 13:44.407
place the weight pin
under the desired weight.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.243
[groaning]

13:47.327 --> 13:50.038
Be careful
to release the weight...

13:50.121 --> 13:51.581
Slowly.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.624
Huh?

13:53.583 --> 13:55.126
Never mind.

13:55.210 --> 13:58.922
The trampoline,
a fitness favorite.

13:59.005 --> 14:02.842
For the beginner,
it's best to start slowly

14:02.926 --> 14:05.595
and work up
to a stronger bounce.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.526
I really hate this.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.239
Treadmills,
once considered

14:24.322 --> 14:27.534
the most tedious
of exercise devices,

14:27.617 --> 14:30.995
they are now
state-of-the-art fun.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.248
Oh, give me a break.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.834
You gotta see it.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.711
It's got itself
a movie screen.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.213
Gawrsh, Pete.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.965
Maybe you better
not push yourself.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.383
You look tired.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.468
Tired? I'm not tired!

14:45.552 --> 14:46.553
Are you tired?

14:46.636 --> 14:48.054
Well, not...

14:48.138 --> 14:50.181
Then I'm not tired!

14:52.517 --> 14:55.103
Looky, Pete. It gives
you the delusion

14:55.186 --> 14:57.814
of running
on a country road.

14:57.939 --> 14:58.815
Swell.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.817
[panting]

15:04.821 --> 15:06.114
Huh?

15:07.198 --> 15:09.451
Hey, Blimpo!

15:09.534 --> 15:11.202
Catch me if you can!

15:11.286 --> 15:14.164
Ohh! [panting]

15:14.247 --> 15:16.291
Wait'll I get my mitts
on you, you...

15:16.374 --> 15:18.001
Pete, slow down!

15:18.084 --> 15:20.170
I gotcha now!

15:20.253 --> 15:22.672
Pete,
save some energy for...

15:22.756 --> 15:23.673
Ooh!

15:23.757 --> 15:25.675
Aah!

15:25.759 --> 15:27.677
[Goofy] Lunch.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.267
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the first event

15:34.351 --> 15:36.353
of the Mount Ladle
Winter Games...

15:36.436 --> 15:39.230
the dog sled race!

15:39.356 --> 15:42.108
Heh heh heh.
Give it up, tubby.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.110
Dream on, spud.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.030
On your marks...

15:47.113 --> 15:48.782
Get set...

15:52.077 --> 15:54.537
Come on, Daddy, Daddy!
You can do it!

15:54.621 --> 15:57.916
Doesn't look like your dad's
going anywhere.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.251
Don't give up
on Pete just yet.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.003
Peg's got a secret weapon.

16:02.087 --> 16:05.924
Mush, you
flea-bitten v-8, mush!

16:07.342 --> 16:09.719
Whoa, boy, steady!

16:15.225 --> 16:16.059
What?

16:16.142 --> 16:18.228
Allow me, my dear.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.316
Thank you, Mr. Roadster,

16:23.400 --> 16:25.443
for letting my husband win.

16:25.568 --> 16:26.861
Uh, don't mention...

16:26.945 --> 16:27.821
What?

16:27.904 --> 16:29.239
Gangway!

16:29.322 --> 16:30.865
[arf arf]

16:34.619 --> 16:37.205
Get goin', bone-breath!

16:39.457 --> 16:43.253
[cheering]

16:43.336 --> 16:46.589
Now for Mount Ladle's
most popular event,

16:46.673 --> 16:48.466
ice dancing!

16:48.550 --> 16:50.051
Ooh! Ooh!

16:50.135 --> 16:51.761
Honey, careful!

16:51.886 --> 16:52.971
Whoa!

16:53.054 --> 16:54.347
Think positive, Pete.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.933
At least the ice
isn't breaking.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.977
Yeah. Whoa!

17:00.520 --> 17:02.105
Ahem.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.315
May I cut in?

17:04.441 --> 17:05.900
Ya sneaky little...

17:06.026 --> 17:07.736
Whoa!

17:11.489 --> 17:13.950
Ha ha ha! Finally,
we are together.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.829
Yes... you, me, and
your idiotic delusions.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.165
Don't fight it.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.959
What are you
gonna do now, Pete?

17:23.043 --> 17:27.380
It's what you're gonna do
that counts, Goofster!

17:30.550 --> 17:31.843
Aah!

17:34.929 --> 17:36.306
I love you.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.562
Oh, kiss me.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.064
Hey, watch out!

17:50.111 --> 17:52.572
Passionate, ain't he?

17:54.366 --> 17:56.451
And what winter games
would be complete

17:56.534 --> 17:58.411
without an ice hockey match?

18:01.623 --> 18:03.583
Well, contestant number 1

18:03.667 --> 18:05.960
is obviously ready
for the slapshot portion

18:06.044 --> 18:07.921
of our
friendly competition.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.882
Oh, I'm ready, all right.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.342
Heh heh heh!

18:12.425 --> 18:14.928
But where's number 2?

18:15.011 --> 18:17.263
Ah, here he comes.

18:19.891 --> 18:22.769
Why, Peter,
you're doing wonderfully.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.355
You'll show that showoff
what you're made of.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.358
Whatever he's made of
sure is heavy.

18:28.483 --> 18:31.152
I don't like this.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.863
Oh, don't be silly, Pete.

18:33.988 --> 18:34.948
All you've got to do

18:35.073 --> 18:36.950
is keep the round things
out of the net.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.118
That's all?

18:38.243 --> 18:40.120
Sure, Petey!

18:40.203 --> 18:42.539
It'll be a cincheruno!

18:42.664 --> 18:44.416
Yeah.

18:44.499 --> 18:47.168
Oh, Pete,
I'm so proud of you.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.881
Maybe this isn't
gonna be so bad.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.758
Good luck, Petey!

18:53.842 --> 18:54.884
Whoa!

18:54.968 --> 18:58.471
Ready or not,
here they come!

19:00.098 --> 19:02.142
Ooh... mama.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.477
Ooh! Ow! Stop!

19:04.602 --> 19:06.312
Cease fire!

19:17.699 --> 19:21.161
I told you
I could do it, mommy.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.373
Finally, the giant slalom!

19:25.498 --> 19:28.126
Our two finalists face
a dangerous challenge.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.544
One false move,

19:29.627 --> 19:31.087
and it's a 1,200-foot drop

19:31.171 --> 19:32.339
off the north face.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.680
I'll be waiting for you
at the finish line.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.307
[both] All right.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.808
[both growling]

19:46.853 --> 19:49.230
After you.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.608
No way. You first.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.611
Oh, I insist
you proceed me.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.113
No, no. You go first.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.949
Ho hum. All right.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.952
Yaah!

20:03.036 --> 20:05.080
Ooh. That musta hurt.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.831
Some guys never listen.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.252
Skiers, take your marks...

20:11.336 --> 20:13.213
And go!

20:17.509 --> 20:19.678
Come on, slow poke!

20:19.761 --> 20:21.971
Hey, watch it!

20:22.055 --> 20:23.098
Take it easy, will ya?

20:26.226 --> 20:28.603
Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, yeah.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.610
Whew!

20:35.735 --> 20:37.529
Whoa!

20:44.202 --> 20:46.663
Petey-boy,
you are a piece of...

20:46.746 --> 20:48.373
Aah!

20:51.543 --> 20:54.546
He's gonna
ski off the cliff!

20:54.629 --> 20:57.298
I'm too good-looking to die!

20:57.382 --> 21:00.677
No, no, no!

21:04.514 --> 21:08.768
Oh, Tan, honey, that big RV
salesman saved your life.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.313
That-a-boy, Petey!

21:12.397 --> 21:13.732
Way to go, Pop!

21:16.860 --> 21:20.488
Oh, sugar-pie,
are you okay?

21:20.613 --> 21:23.366
Okay, I've
learned my lesson, Pete.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.202
You can't have
too much of a good thing.

21:26.286 --> 21:29.539
You know, Peg, you've got
a good man there.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.957
True.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.335
And he's got a good woman.

21:33.418 --> 21:37.922
W-W-Well... I guess I
sh-sh-showed that guy

21:38.006 --> 21:39.591
what I was made of.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.259
And I guess it showed you

21:41.343 --> 21:42.677
how important exercise is

21:42.761 --> 21:44.179
to keep a marriage together.

21:44.262 --> 21:47.223
Oh, exercise, schmexercise.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.517
All it does is make you smell bad.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.977
I don't need it.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.354
Oh, well.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.938
Come in the kitchen.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.357
Dinner's ready.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.567
Yummy! I'm starved!

21:59.986 --> 22:02.655
Oh, no. I'm stuck.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.407
Help! Peg!

22:04.491 --> 22:05.909
Lemme outta here!

22:05.992 --> 22:07.243
Help!

22:07.327 --> 22:08.870

[sobbing] Get me outta here!

22:13.416 --> 22:15.043
♪ Gimme a beat ♪

22:41.444 --> 22:42.445
Yeah!
