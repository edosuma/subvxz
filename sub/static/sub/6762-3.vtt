Now, the DWP is encouraging
the public to use this week--

01:40.378 --> 01:44.755
All right, l'm all packed,
but l still can't find my blue shirt.

01:44.924 --> 01:46.501
Honey, l'm sure l saw it
in your drawer.

01:46.676 --> 01:47.838
No, l already checked.

01:48.052 --> 01:50.091
Actually, l wore that shirt
to the beach last week.

01:50.555 --> 01:52.214
Brenda, why do you have to wear
my shirts?

01:52.431 --> 01:54.138
Because they look great.

01:54.308 --> 01:56.680
Girl in a guy's shirt, Dad,
there's nothing like it.

01:56.894 --> 01:59.431
Beverly Hills financier, Jack McKay,
returned to--

01:59.647 --> 02:01.390
Oh, my God, that's Dylan's dad.
Turn it up.

02:01.565 --> 02:05.183
--Mexico and was taken
into custody by federal marshals.

02:05.361 --> 02:08.277
McKay, who was facing
imminent extradition,

02:08.489 --> 02:12.901
has been indicted on 23 counts
of federal income tax evasion--

02:13.076 --> 02:15.282
Smartest thing she ever did
was break up with that guy.

02:15.495 --> 02:18.579
Our Linda Grayson
was on the scene.

02:19.291 --> 02:22.291
For the past decade, the name
Jack McKay was synonymous

02:22.460 --> 02:24.119
with big business in Los Angeles.

02:24.337 --> 02:27.254
lt was only a matter of time
before they caught up with that crook.

02:27.423 --> 02:29.498
Dad, he's innocent
until proven guilty.

02:29.717 --> 02:30.879
Does he look innocent to you?

02:31.094 --> 02:33.382
--multimillionaire told the court

02:33.554 --> 02:39.426
that his liabilities exceed his assets
by as much as $6 million.

02:39.602 --> 02:42.555
McKay's assets have been seized--

02:43.689 --> 02:47.852
Hi. You know what to do
after the beeparooni.

02:48.026 --> 02:51.774
lt's me, Brenda. Are you okay?

02:51.947 --> 02:55.778
Dylan. Dylan, please, pick up.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.131
A tropical storm off the Baja coast

03:14.302 --> 03:17.006
is kicking up some wicked sets
this morning.

03:17.179 --> 03:19.337
The Coast Guard reports
small-craft advisories

03:19.557 --> 03:22.344
from Point Conception
to the Mexican border.

03:22.560 --> 03:27.305
Malibu Beach reports 3- to 5-foot
waves, good- to excellent-shape.

03:27.481 --> 03:31.893
Santa Monica reports
4- to 5-foot breakers, excellent shape.

03:32.069 --> 03:35.354
Zuma reports 8-foot swells
from the southwest.

03:35.530 --> 03:39.194
So buckle up for safety
and party hearty.

03:44.289 --> 03:46.862
- Hey, man.
- Hey, buddy.

03:47.292 --> 03:49.617
Figured l'd see you.
lt's pretty thrashing out there.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.878
Yeah, summer storm.
Nature's gift to surf bums.

03:53.047 --> 03:54.375
You gonna be dangling later?

03:54.549 --> 03:56.874
l don't know,
depends how the waves hold up.

03:57.051 --> 04:00.669
Brenda's been looking for you, man.
We saw the news.

04:00.846 --> 04:03.052
Yeah.
Finally caught up with the old man.

04:03.224 --> 04:06.177
- ls everything okay?
- Yeah, B, don't worry about it, man.

04:06.352 --> 04:08.391
He's paying the best lawyers in L.A.
to do that.

04:08.937 --> 04:10.312
And what about you? You all right?

04:10.522 --> 04:11.932
Are you kidding?

04:12.107 --> 04:13.980
Surf's up.

04:17.904 --> 04:21.023
Mother, l will not let you use that.
lt doesn't have any sun block in it.

04:21.199 --> 04:23.606
Oh, honey,
l've given up every vice in the world.

04:23.785 --> 04:24.816
Don't take away my tan.

04:24.994 --> 04:26.951
You didn't work this hard
to clean up your act

04:27.121 --> 04:28.828
just so you could drop dead
of skin cancer.

04:28.998 --> 04:31.156
Yes, mother.

04:34.879 --> 04:38.627
You know,
without a margarita to play with,

04:38.799 --> 04:40.708
sitting on a lounge chair
is really dreadful.

04:40.926 --> 04:43.214
Well, you must not be facing
the right direction.

04:43.387 --> 04:44.715
Where?

04:47.599 --> 04:50.386
Maybe there is one more
good vice left.

04:50.561 --> 04:51.640
Check him out.

04:53.355 --> 04:54.683
Not bad.

04:55.274 --> 04:56.602
What do you think about him?

04:58.485 --> 04:59.895
Gross.

05:00.111 --> 05:02.684
Yeah, well,
you can still afford to be picky.

05:03.490 --> 05:04.984
Now, that is more like it.

05:06.076 --> 05:08.448
Steve?
l thought you guys were history.

05:08.661 --> 05:10.368
Not Steve, mother.

05:10.580 --> 05:13.580
Kyle Conners.

05:15.626 --> 05:19.160
Youth is definitely wasted
on the young.

05:26.428 --> 05:28.385
Well, mystical surf wizard,

05:28.555 --> 05:31.840
what does your wisdom tell us about
these massive sets of destruction?

05:32.017 --> 05:34.223
l think we're in
for a serious pounding.

05:34.394 --> 05:36.635
Anybody who would go out in them
has gotta be loony.

05:42.777 --> 05:43.808
Yeah.

05:47.157 --> 05:48.948
So when's his father's arraignment?

05:49.117 --> 05:50.148
l don't know.

05:50.326 --> 05:51.820
Will he post bond?

05:51.995 --> 05:54.117
Andrea,
l don't know any more than you do.

05:54.288 --> 05:56.613
Yeah, but, Brenda,
don't you talk to Dylan?

05:56.791 --> 05:58.498
We broke up, remember?

05:58.668 --> 06:00.660
Yeah, l know.
But l thought at a time like this--

06:00.836 --> 06:04.251
No, Andrea.
lf Dylan wants to talk, he can call me.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.923
William Shakespeare
wrote his first play in 1 590.

06:13.098 --> 06:14.592
Does anyone know what it was?

06:14.808 --> 06:18.390
- Yes, Andrea?
- Andrea. Henry Vl.

06:18.603 --> 06:20.013
Right. Very good, An-- Andrea.

06:20.856 --> 06:23.856
Shakespeare followed that big hit
with the world's first sequel.

06:24.025 --> 06:28.520
Anybody know what it was called?
Donna, how about you tell us?

06:31.241 --> 06:33.613
Henry Vl, part 2?

06:33.826 --> 06:34.857
She's right.

06:35.536 --> 06:39.200
You know, in Shakespeare's day,
men performed all the parts.

06:39.373 --> 06:41.116
Fortunately, things have changed.

06:41.292 --> 06:42.536
And to honour the bard,

06:42.710 --> 06:45.247
we're all gonna try some scenes
from Shakespeare this week.

06:45.463 --> 06:47.585
Shakespeare?
This class was supposed to be fun.

06:47.798 --> 06:51.925
Come on.
Macbeth. King Lear. Hamlet.

06:52.136 --> 06:54.887
Well, it was good enough
for Mel Gibson.

06:55.055 --> 06:59.965
So which of you ingenues
would like to try the role of Juliet?

07:00.977 --> 07:02.684
- Donna.
- Me?

07:02.896 --> 07:03.927
Yes, you.

07:04.105 --> 07:07.354
And for your partner,
teen heartthrob of all-time.

07:07.525 --> 07:09.482
Let's see.

07:09.652 --> 07:17.148
Never was there a story of more woe
than this of Donna and her Romeo.

07:30.839 --> 07:32.997
See something interesting?

07:33.175 --> 07:35.926
Just picking up
on some of the finer points.

07:36.094 --> 07:38.382
What, the game or Kyle?

07:50.150 --> 07:51.478
Nice serve.

07:51.651 --> 07:53.394
Thanks.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.853
- The ball?
- lt'll cost you.

08:00.409 --> 08:03.409
- Well, what did you have in mind?
- How about some private lessons?

08:05.539 --> 08:06.949
All right. All right, you got it.

08:07.124 --> 08:09.246
Private lessons starting tomorrow.

08:09.460 --> 08:11.002
- Early.
- Groovy.

08:13.964 --> 08:16.501
- Can l have my ball back now?
- Oh, sure.

08:17.759 --> 08:19.550
Hey, are we playing or what?

08:24.141 --> 08:27.307
l remember groping my way
through Shakespeare in high school.

08:27.519 --> 08:29.428
l was Lady Macbeth
in the class play.

08:29.646 --> 08:31.389
You weren't.

08:32.232 --> 08:34.472
Out, damned spot! Out, l say!

08:34.650 --> 08:37.984
Who would have thought the old pot
to have so much dirt in her?

08:41.657 --> 08:43.448
lt's a joke.

08:43.618 --> 08:48.493
You know, Macbeth killed the king,
and there was all this blood and...

08:49.123 --> 08:51.329
- Forget it.
- l'll get that.

08:57.131 --> 08:58.755
Hello?

08:59.424 --> 09:02.377
No, Brandon's not here. Who's this?

09:05.180 --> 09:06.887
Well, where is he? What happened?

09:07.057 --> 09:08.599
What is it?

09:08.767 --> 09:10.510
All right, we'll be right there.

09:11.853 --> 09:14.094
lt's Dylan. He was surfing.
There was an accident.

09:14.272 --> 09:16.311
- He's in the hospital.
- Oh, my God.

09:16.858 --> 09:18.482
- ls he all right?
- l don't know.

09:19.193 --> 09:20.272
Come on.

09:24.156 --> 09:26.444
Dr. Miller, report to Emergency.

09:26.617 --> 09:30.151
Dr. Miller, report to Emergency.

09:32.915 --> 09:35.452
Dr. Ash, stat to Emergency.

09:35.626 --> 09:38.875
Dr. Ash, stat to Emergency.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.133
Nurse Morgan, to nurse's station ER.

09:45.302 --> 09:48.884
Nurse Morgan, nurse's station ER.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.183
Dylan?

09:56.104 --> 09:57.135
How did you know?

09:58.189 --> 09:59.980
When you were unconscious,

10:00.149 --> 10:02.639
paramedics found Brandon's name
and phone number in your car.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.227
You scared me.

10:06.322 --> 10:08.991
lt was awesome.

10:09.158 --> 10:11.316
Yeah, really awesome. Look at you.

10:11.494 --> 10:13.118
You're lucky to be alive.

10:13.287 --> 10:18.114
l'm fine. You look like an angel.

10:19.751 --> 10:22.954
l called you last night.
Why didn't you call me back?

10:23.130 --> 10:25.751
l couldn't talk to anybody.

10:25.924 --> 10:26.955
Not even me?

10:27.717 --> 10:30.634
l'm sorry l didn't answer the phone.

10:30.845 --> 10:32.504
Dylan, does your dad know?

10:34.224 --> 10:35.718
Yeah, his lawyers were here earlier.

10:35.892 --> 10:39.592
Somebody had to give them
permission to treat me.

10:41.355 --> 10:43.596
l need you, Bren.

10:44.567 --> 10:46.274
l know.

10:48.029 --> 10:50.566
Everything's gonna be all right.

10:50.739 --> 10:52.565
You're gonna be
out of here in no time.

10:52.783 --> 10:55.155
- l better go.
- Don't leave.

10:55.661 --> 10:58.578
You need your rest,
the doctor said so.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.915
Brenda...

11:12.093 --> 11:15.046
Dr. Miller, please report to lCU.

11:15.221 --> 11:17.130
How's he doing?

11:17.765 --> 11:19.591
Okay, l guess.

11:21.227 --> 11:23.764
Well, the doctor said
it's just a mild concussion

11:23.938 --> 11:26.013
and a few cracked ribs,
but they wanna keep him here

11:26.190 --> 11:29.356
for a few days because there's
no one to take care of him at home.

11:29.527 --> 11:32.196
So l told them
we'd take him home with us.

11:33.656 --> 11:35.981
Dylan and l broke up, remember?

11:36.158 --> 11:38.446
l can't have him living in our house.

11:38.619 --> 11:42.367
Brenda, l couldn't just leave him
here alone in the hospital.

11:42.539 --> 11:45.029
l mean, he's Brandon's friend too.

11:46.877 --> 11:48.916
lt's just for a few days.

11:49.087 --> 11:50.830
Let's go.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.887
Oh, Brenda, would you take this
up to Dylan for me, please?

12:05.102 --> 12:07.889
Sorry, Mom, it was your idea.
l'm not gonna play Nancy Nurse.

12:08.105 --> 12:10.512
- Brenda.
- Well, what do you want, Mom?

12:10.691 --> 12:12.683
First, you and Dad tell me
not to sleep with him,

12:12.860 --> 12:15.315
then you tuck him
in the next bedroom?

12:16.113 --> 12:19.316
- Well, where are you going?
- Out.

12:22.578 --> 12:24.535
Sorry l'm taking your room over,
man.

12:24.746 --> 12:28.825
Oh, that's all right, Jones.
The sofa will be fine.

12:33.463 --> 12:35.122
Guess a couple busted ribs
are God's way

12:35.298 --> 12:38.168
- of telling you you're grounded, huh?
- Yeah, that's funny.

12:38.343 --> 12:40.002
l'd laugh, except it hurts.

12:40.929 --> 12:43.170
What exactly happened out there,
man?

12:43.348 --> 12:45.387
l was stupid.

12:45.558 --> 12:47.135
Tube started to close out on me,

12:47.310 --> 12:50.974
l got jacked from behind.
l should have seen it coming.

12:51.147 --> 12:52.689
Well, you had a lot on your mind.

12:52.898 --> 12:55.223
This has nothing to do with my dad,
Sigmund.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.439
Oh, that's right.
Nothing ever gets to you, huh?

12:59.613 --> 13:02.862
- Dinner.
- Hey, Mom. Come on in.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.488
Roast chicken with rosemary,
broccoli au gratin,

13:05.661 --> 13:07.902
some new potatoes,
and chocolate mousse pie for dessert.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.952
- Yeah, wow.
- Well, taking care of somebody

13:11.124 --> 13:13.614
brings out my nesting instincts,
and my Cuisinart.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.368
- ls Brenda around?
- Brenda?

13:16.546 --> 13:19.879
No, l think-- l think she went out.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.260
She's not exactly thrilled
with my being here.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.505
Well, you know how she is when she
makes her mind up about something.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.177
Yeah. You wouldn't call her stubborn,
would you?

13:29.350 --> 13:32.599
- Stubborn? Brenda? No.
- No. No.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.350
Listen, you have some dinner,
and just try to get some sleep.

13:37.524 --> 13:39.563
Okay, yeah.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.522
- Mrs. Walsh?
- Yes?

13:44.615 --> 13:45.777
l've forgotten how nice it is

13:45.949 --> 13:48.985
to have a family
to take care of you when you're sick.

13:49.202 --> 13:51.527
This is very nice. Thank you.

13:51.746 --> 13:54.830
That's okay. She can't help herself.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.704
We all just want you to get well.

13:59.879 --> 14:01.254
What about el padrino?

14:01.422 --> 14:03.794
Don't worry about him. He's cool.

14:04.008 --> 14:09.168
Brandon, your dad is a lot of things.
Cool is not one of them.

14:09.388 --> 14:11.510
Honey, l'm telling you,
you're asking for trouble.

14:11.724 --> 14:14.475
l didn't have any choice.
He didn't have anywhere to go.

14:14.643 --> 14:15.923
Doesn't the kid have a mother?

14:16.103 --> 14:17.383
Oh, she lives in Hawaii.

14:17.938 --> 14:19.597
Well, let him go to Hawaii.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.558
Jim, you are not being reasonable.

14:21.775 --> 14:23.814
l am being reasonable.
l'm thinking about Brenda.

14:23.986 --> 14:25.943
Brenda's fine.

14:27.781 --> 14:29.820
Well, just lock her door.

14:30.033 --> 14:32.108
Jim, the boy can't even move.

14:32.661 --> 14:35.412
He can move. When it comes
to Brenda, he can move.

14:41.419 --> 14:43.660
Hamlet, huh?

14:45.631 --> 14:47.338
To be a bitch or not to be a bitch?

14:47.508 --> 14:50.793
- That is the question.
- l wouldn't say you've been a bitch.

14:51.470 --> 14:54.673
Then again, you haven't said a word
to him and he has been here all day.

14:56.016 --> 14:59.052
l thought that we could stay friends,
but that's before he moved in.

14:59.228 --> 15:01.979
Man, just go talk to him.
Say good night or something.

15:02.147 --> 15:06.358
Brandon,
this is between Dylan and me.

15:08.028 --> 15:11.064
You know, he's right.
You are stubborn.

15:12.866 --> 15:14.823
l am not stubborn.

15:14.993 --> 15:16.368
Come on in.

15:16.536 --> 15:17.911
No.

15:18.747 --> 15:20.869
You avoiding me?

15:24.127 --> 15:26.997
Dylan, l made a promise to myself.

15:27.422 --> 15:29.663
l need this time.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.714
How am l gonna get through this
without you?

15:31.884 --> 15:34.553
You are the only one that l trust.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.463
l'm not ready.

15:36.639 --> 15:39.592
l need to think things out
to be sure about what l want.

15:39.767 --> 15:43.100
Don't make me beg, Bren. l won't.

15:49.026 --> 15:50.603
Dylan, l'm sorry. l can't.

15:50.777 --> 15:52.187
Can't what?

15:52.362 --> 15:54.188
l can't do this.

16:43.578 --> 16:44.692
You go first.

16:45.163 --> 16:48.033
No, it was harder for you
to get out of bed. Go ahead.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.784
lt's your bathroom though.

16:51.085 --> 16:53.658
- You can have it.
- You sure?

16:53.880 --> 16:57.663
- Yeah, l'll wait.
- Okay. Thanks.

16:58.217 --> 16:59.415
Okay.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.055
Good night, again.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.383
Good night.

17:23.616 --> 17:26.022
You did good at the spikes.
Now, this is a little harder.

17:26.202 --> 17:30.246
Put your arms together like that--
Okay, parallel. There, you got it.

17:30.415 --> 17:32.787
- Oh, my Lord.
- Good, pocketful, you're getting better.

17:32.959 --> 17:35.165
- Okay, ready? One more.
- Okay.

17:35.336 --> 17:38.336
Kelly doesn't get up at the crack
of dawn for just anybody, Steve.

17:38.506 --> 17:40.794
lt's a summer fling.
He can have her.

17:40.966 --> 17:43.124
You know, Kyle told me he had
a girlfriend at Beverly,

17:43.302 --> 17:45.294
but she might be transferring
to West Beverly.

17:45.471 --> 17:46.846
You don't say, huh?

17:47.014 --> 17:49.849
Well, maybe Kelly Taylor
can't have everything she wants.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.184
- What's wrong?
- Oh, l don't know.

17:53.353 --> 17:55.096
l think l hit the ball wrong
or something.

17:55.272 --> 17:56.766
Well, just shake it off.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.315
lt hurts.

17:58.525 --> 18:00.019
Let me see.

18:01.444 --> 18:03.685
That's much better.

18:03.905 --> 18:07.190
- You know, you have beautiful hands.
- Thank you.

18:08.201 --> 18:11.154
Kelly, l was wondering,

18:11.329 --> 18:13.155
would you feel
like getting together sometime?

18:13.748 --> 18:15.574
You mean, off the court?

18:15.791 --> 18:17.368
Yeah.

18:17.543 --> 18:19.286
Like a date?

18:19.920 --> 18:21.082
Yeah, l guess so.

18:22.256 --> 18:24.295
l thought you'd never ask.

18:25.009 --> 18:27.334
Well, how about tonight?

18:27.511 --> 18:30.001
Okay, cool. Give me a call.

18:30.180 --> 18:31.971
Okay, great.

18:35.352 --> 18:36.431
Yes!

18:40.440 --> 18:42.515
Kelly, did you know
he's got a girlfriend?

18:42.692 --> 18:44.316
Steve, did you know
you're being a jerk?

18:44.486 --> 18:45.648
He's playing with your mind.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.524
Oh, that would be a welcome change,
wouldn't it?

18:51.909 --> 18:56.238
The sweet bells
jangled out of tune and harsh.

18:56.414 --> 18:59.996
That unmatched form and stature
of blown youth.

19:00.167 --> 19:02.492
Blasted with ecstasy.

19:02.670 --> 19:06.584
O, woe is me, to see
what l have seen, what l see.

19:08.467 --> 19:12.464
Yeah. All right. Great.

19:13.513 --> 19:15.422
l don't know, Brenda,
that was pretty terrific.

19:15.599 --> 19:16.843
You really understand Ophelia.

19:17.267 --> 19:19.425
Maybe it's because
l'm sharing a bathroom with Hamlet.

19:19.603 --> 19:21.891
All right, class,
that will be it for today.

19:22.105 --> 19:25.022
Tomorrow,
we're moving on to fair Verona

19:25.191 --> 19:26.815
where we lay our scene,

19:26.985 --> 19:30.234
and a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life.

19:30.405 --> 19:33.441
David, Donna, l hope you're ready.

19:38.162 --> 19:43.238
Well, what do you feel like tonight?
Chinese or sushi?

19:43.417 --> 19:45.623
Mom, l kind of have plans
for dinner.

19:45.794 --> 19:49.162
- A date?
- Yeah, Kyle finally asked me out.

19:49.339 --> 19:51.711
Great. So tell me about this Kyle.

19:51.884 --> 19:53.757
What is he, Mr. Superjock?

19:53.969 --> 19:56.542
Well, he's the best volleyball player
l know,

19:56.722 --> 19:59.391
and he plays wide receiver
on West Beverly's football team.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.390
Sounds like he has
very good hands.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.388
He's not like that. Not yet, anyway.

20:04.562 --> 20:06.056
But l really like him.

20:06.231 --> 20:09.184
Good. At least one of us
is having some fun.

20:09.359 --> 20:10.603
You're never gonna meet anybody

20:10.777 --> 20:12.816
if you just keep sitting up here
at the cabana.

20:13.196 --> 20:14.476
l know.

20:14.655 --> 20:17.608
But it's gonna take me a while
before l remember

20:17.783 --> 20:20.487
how to be sewy and charming
without being inebriated.

20:20.661 --> 20:23.116
Well, it's like volleyball.
You just need a little practice.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.779
Honey, l've had 20 years of practise.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.665
l think l'll just lay low.

20:27.835 --> 20:30.622
Let you be the social butterfly
this summer.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.420
l'm really proud of you, Mom.

20:33.006 --> 20:34.334
One day at a time.

20:36.301 --> 20:40.428
Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

20:40.597 --> 20:43.716
Oh, shall l hear more,
or shall l speak at this?

20:43.892 --> 20:46.347
You shall stop.
God, l can't bear this anymore.

20:46.519 --> 20:48.641
You have got to be the worst Romeo
l've ever seen.

20:48.813 --> 20:50.437
Well, you're no Sandra Bernhard.

20:50.607 --> 20:52.184
You mean, Sarah Bernhardt.

20:52.358 --> 20:53.900
Well, yeah, her too.

20:54.068 --> 20:55.859
You know, l resent that, David.

20:56.028 --> 20:58.565
This is all your fault.
You stink at this.

20:58.739 --> 21:01.064
Well, we're both
gonna be humiliated here.

21:01.242 --> 21:04.029
Well, not me. You can be
totally humiliated all by yourself,

21:04.203 --> 21:06.278
because l quit.

21:06.455 --> 21:09.028
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

21:10.793 --> 21:13.829
Mom, l'm home.

21:14.004 --> 21:16.245
Your mom's shopping.

21:22.762 --> 21:23.793
Nobody's here?

21:24.014 --> 21:25.424
Just me and Oprah.

21:26.224 --> 21:28.631
Do you need anything?
A soda or something?

21:28.852 --> 21:30.050
Yeah, that would be great.

21:38.111 --> 21:40.732
Your mom said there are some
sandwiches in the refrigerator.

21:40.947 --> 21:42.489
Okay.

21:45.076 --> 21:47.033
And an apple.

21:48.204 --> 21:50.113
Okay.

21:59.506 --> 22:02.590
- Anything else?
- Could l get a blanket?

22:09.599 --> 22:12.932
And my book's on that table
right over there.

22:17.023 --> 22:20.023
- Will that be all?
- Just one more thing.

22:20.234 --> 22:22.273
- What?
- You.

22:25.698 --> 22:27.441
Dylan.

22:29.827 --> 22:33.112
- l'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. Don't stop.

22:33.288 --> 22:36.988
You know the hardest thing l ever had
to do was try to stay away from you.

22:49.554 --> 22:51.463
What the hell is going on?

22:51.681 --> 22:53.305
Dad, it's not what you think.

22:53.516 --> 22:55.259
lt isn't? lt sure looks like it is.

22:55.518 --> 22:58.767
- Mr. Walsh, l can explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

22:58.938 --> 23:02.022
Except maybe why you decided
to take advantage of our hospitality

23:02.191 --> 23:04.397
by taking advantage
of my daughter.

23:04.568 --> 23:08.399
Dad! lt's not like that at all.

23:15.454 --> 23:17.078
l don't care if he hears me.

23:17.247 --> 23:19.619
He was in my house
and with my daughter.

23:19.791 --> 23:21.201
l told you there would be trouble.

23:21.376 --> 23:24.211
- Jim, they were just kissing.
- lt was a little more than that.

23:24.379 --> 23:26.786
And if l hadn't walked in,
it would have gone a lot further.

23:26.965 --> 23:29.087
Jim, listen to yourself.
What about us?

23:29.259 --> 23:30.290
We were older.

23:30.468 --> 23:33.303
Well, still, we said
we were going to trust Brenda.

23:33.471 --> 23:35.428
Yeah, that was before
Don Juan moved in.

23:35.598 --> 23:37.720
- You're overreacting.
- When is he leaving?

23:37.892 --> 23:40.347
The doctor said he needed
at least five days' bed rest.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.227
- Okay, he's been here three, right?
- Yes.

23:42.396 --> 23:44.803
Fine. Another couple of days
and then that's it.

23:47.109 --> 23:48.188
Dylan, l'm sorry.

23:48.986 --> 23:51.358
lt's not your fault, Bren.

23:58.287 --> 24:01.821
You know, l always thought you were
the hottest girl at West Beverly.

24:01.999 --> 24:03.706
Then why didn't you
ever ask me out?

24:04.459 --> 24:07.080
l would have gone out with you
in a second.

24:07.254 --> 24:09.661
Well, we're here now.

24:10.590 --> 24:12.249
True.

24:15.261 --> 24:18.879
Kyle, is it true that you're dating
a girl at Beverly Hills High?

24:19.057 --> 24:21.049
We broke up.

24:21.225 --> 24:23.098
How come?

24:23.269 --> 24:25.427
lt was getting too serious.

24:26.188 --> 24:28.310
l can relate to that.

24:30.860 --> 24:34.228
Do you wanna have some fun
of the not-so-serious kind?

24:34.405 --> 24:36.064
Like what?

24:37.991 --> 24:40.197
Follow me.

24:41.161 --> 24:42.619
Come on, Kyle, don't be shy.

24:42.788 --> 24:44.661
- What are you doing?
- Live a little. Yeah.

24:50.003 --> 24:52.161
Kelly, you're--
You're gonna freeze out there.

24:52.338 --> 24:55.422
No, l won't. l'm not gonna get my hair
wet unless you come in. Come on.

24:55.592 --> 24:56.754
Forget it.

25:00.638 --> 25:02.677
Give me a towel, would you?

25:10.022 --> 25:11.765
Thank you.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.559
Yeah.

25:17.696 --> 25:20.483
Well, it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

25:21.325 --> 25:23.946
Look, Kelly...

25:24.161 --> 25:28.288
lt's okay.
There's a lot we can do on dry land.

25:34.254 --> 25:35.712
What?

25:36.339 --> 25:38.497
l'm sorry, Kelly. l'm not into this.

25:40.176 --> 25:41.967
What do you mean?
l thought you liked me.

25:42.178 --> 25:43.837
l do, Kelly, you're great, but--

25:44.013 --> 25:45.555
But what?

25:46.807 --> 25:49.807
l don't know. l mean,
you're coming on pretty strong.

25:51.228 --> 25:53.801
Okay, l guess Steve was right.

25:53.981 --> 25:55.807
So you're playing mind games
with me, right?

25:55.983 --> 25:58.734
Look, Kelly, l'm sorry
if l gave you the wrong idea.

25:58.902 --> 26:00.894
What did you expect me to think?

26:01.071 --> 26:03.644
You ask me out here...

26:03.824 --> 26:07.192
Okay, fine. l feel like such a fool.

26:07.411 --> 26:09.403
Kelly, l'm sorry.

26:09.579 --> 26:11.618
Just take me home.

27:33.493 --> 27:34.951
l hope you're satisfied.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.578
What?

27:37.122 --> 27:39.612
Dylan's gone. He left.
Are you happy now?

27:39.791 --> 27:41.035
Brenda.

27:41.209 --> 27:43.118
- Where are you going?
- To find him.

27:43.294 --> 27:46.247
And when l do, to say l'm sorry
for having a father that's such a jerk.

27:46.464 --> 27:47.958
Brenda.

27:55.389 --> 27:58.508
Kyle, l hear you had a hot date
with Kelly last night.

27:58.684 --> 28:00.012
- So?
- Well.

28:00.185 --> 28:02.391
Moonlight on the beach,
fireside picnic.

28:02.563 --> 28:04.804
You made all the right moves.
Did she go for it?

28:04.982 --> 28:06.061
Yeah, we had a good time.

28:06.233 --> 28:08.640
- Oh, yeah? How good?
- Hey, man, ease up, all right?

28:08.819 --> 28:11.356
l'm just curious.
You guys make a great couple.

28:11.530 --> 28:13.154
We're not a couple.

28:13.365 --> 28:14.907
Hold on a second, handsome.

28:15.075 --> 28:17.862
You mean, you passed up
an opportunity with Kelly Taylor?

28:18.036 --> 28:19.198
What happened?

28:19.370 --> 28:20.449
Nothing.

28:20.622 --> 28:23.907
All right, Steve? Nothing happened.
ls that what you wanna hear?

28:32.466 --> 28:34.375
Kelly.

28:34.593 --> 28:35.873
Kelly, please. Let's talk.

28:36.095 --> 28:37.921
l don't feel like talking.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.346
Summer fling over so soon?

28:46.146 --> 28:47.937
Get lost, Steve.

28:59.617 --> 29:01.526
l already told you, l'm not doing it.

29:01.703 --> 29:04.620
Donna, you can't just quit
or you'll get an F on the project.

29:04.789 --> 29:05.820
Yeah, well, chances are,

29:05.998 --> 29:09.331
with you as a partner,
l'll get an F even if l don't quit.

29:09.502 --> 29:13.451
l know how to put this over, Donna,
maybe even get us an A.

29:13.631 --> 29:15.208
How?

29:15.382 --> 29:17.504
- No way.
- What?

29:17.718 --> 29:22.426
Not until you apologise and admit
that you're just as bad as l am.

29:26.435 --> 29:29.969
Okay. l'm sorry, okay?

29:30.147 --> 29:34.226
And l'm just as bad as you are.
There.

29:34.401 --> 29:36.476
Now, what's your plan?

29:36.653 --> 29:39.226
Come with me. Come on.

29:39.447 --> 29:42.483
l went to the condo, l went to the hotel,
and nobody knows where he is.

29:42.659 --> 29:47.036
Okay, thanks.
Yes, we'll call if we hear anything.

29:47.205 --> 29:48.699
Did Dylan say anything to you two

29:48.873 --> 29:51.114
about spending the summer
with his mother in Hawaii?

29:51.292 --> 29:53.249
- Not me.
- Me either.

29:53.419 --> 29:55.126
Well, after his father
turned himself in,

29:55.296 --> 29:57.537
it seems Dylan's mother
made arrangements for him

29:57.715 --> 29:59.707
to spend the summer with her
in Hawaii.

29:59.884 --> 30:03.133
l mean, the morning of his accident,
he was supposed to be on a plane.

30:04.179 --> 30:06.301
Nobody's heard from him.

32:21.519 --> 32:26.014
Dylan, come on out here, son.
You're missing all the fun.

32:27.233 --> 32:29.521
Be right there, Dad.

32:41.664 --> 32:43.621
Don't drop me, Daddy.
Don't drop me.

32:43.791 --> 32:46.328
l'll never drop you, son. l promise.

32:46.502 --> 32:49.751
l'll always be here for you.
l'll never let you fall.

32:49.922 --> 32:53.125
l'll always be here for you.
l'll never let you fall.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.549
l'll always be here for you.
l'll never let you fall.

34:05.035 --> 34:06.493
Dylan.

34:07.204 --> 34:08.661
Hey.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.242
Hey.

34:12.292 --> 34:14.118
Everyone's been looking
all over for you, man.

34:14.335 --> 34:15.616
What are you doing here?

34:15.795 --> 34:18.962
- l just needed a place to crash.
- Well, you can't crash here.

34:19.132 --> 34:22.168
- Henry will call the cops. Come on.
- Hey.

34:22.844 --> 34:24.801
Check this out.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.762
- This used to be your cabana?
- Yeah.

34:35.313 --> 34:37.601
My parents got divorced
when l was about 6.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.940
The marks stopped,
so did everything else.

34:41.404 --> 34:44.190
One last trip
down memory lane, huh?

34:44.364 --> 34:45.989
Come on.

34:51.246 --> 34:53.618
So how come you weren't
on that plane to Hawaii?

34:53.790 --> 34:56.161
How did you know about that?

34:56.585 --> 35:00.119
My mom talked to the lawyer.
Your mom's worried about you.

35:00.297 --> 35:03.084
Yeah. She's the last person
l wanna see right now.

35:03.258 --> 35:05.333
She's your mom, man.
She loves you.

35:05.510 --> 35:07.917
Brandon, your mom was
always there when you needed her.

35:08.096 --> 35:10.717
Mine wasn't.
She was too busy out finding herself.

35:10.890 --> 35:12.300
Come on, she can't be all that bad.

35:12.475 --> 35:14.266
Oh, man, she's a flake.

35:14.435 --> 35:17.352
Aside from the occasional
whacked-out, late-night phone call,

35:17.522 --> 35:20.392
l don't have anything to do with her.
l would like to keep it that way.

35:20.566 --> 35:23.021
Well, sooner or later,
you're gonna have to see her, Dylan.

35:23.194 --> 35:25.731
You can't avoid your mom forever.

35:25.905 --> 35:27.944
Dylan, man, didn't expect
to see you up and around.

35:28.115 --> 35:29.988
Yeah, well, my convalescence
was cut short.

35:30.159 --> 35:32.365
Yeah. Hey, we got a game waiting
whenever you're ready.

35:32.536 --> 35:35.406
- All right, see you later.
- All right, man.

35:35.831 --> 35:38.321
- Kelly.
- Look, what do you want?

35:38.500 --> 35:41.536
- Kelly, please. Just...
- Forget it, Kyle.

35:41.711 --> 35:44.201
l don't wanna forget it, Kelly.
l'm sorry about what happened.

35:44.381 --> 35:46.836
l didn't mean to insult you
or hurt you.

35:47.008 --> 35:49.333
Now, look,
l came on too strong, right?

35:49.511 --> 35:52.084
Don't make this any more
embarrassing for me than it already is.

35:52.263 --> 35:56.307
Kelly, believe me, it's not you.
l mean, l think you're beautiful.

35:57.018 --> 35:58.677
But l'm not your type.

35:59.478 --> 36:01.719
l don't even know what my type is.

36:01.897 --> 36:05.348
Maybe l'm still thinking
about my old girlfriend. l don't know.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.566
So where does that leave us?

36:09.113 --> 36:12.896
l really like you, Kelly.
l want us to be friends.

36:16.620 --> 36:18.411
All right.

36:18.580 --> 36:20.287
Okay.

36:20.457 --> 36:23.410
Look, l'm getting a game together.
You wanna play?

36:23.585 --> 36:25.244
Sure.

36:26.296 --> 36:28.288
Brenda, how many times
do l have to tell you,

36:28.465 --> 36:30.457
you put the dinner plates
with the dinner plates.

36:30.633 --> 36:32.874
- l know how to load it.
- Put the bowls with the bowls.

36:33.052 --> 36:35.507
That way you can get
a lot more in there, you know.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.005
Come on, there's a right way
and a wrong way to do things.

36:38.182 --> 36:39.806
And then there's the Walsh way.

36:39.976 --> 36:42.098
Well, it works for me.

36:42.770 --> 36:45.307
l'm not talking about dishes, Dad.

36:46.440 --> 36:50.389
So far, the Walsh way of raising kids
has worked pretty well.

36:50.569 --> 36:52.976
Maybe we're done being raised.

36:53.947 --> 36:55.026
Think so?

36:55.199 --> 36:56.990
You didn't have to throw him out,
Dad.

36:57.159 --> 36:59.696
- l didn't throw him out.
- You might as well have.

36:59.870 --> 37:01.577
l told him he could stay
until he was well.

37:01.747 --> 37:04.950
You did not! You told him
he had to leave in two days.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.619
How do you think that made him feel?

37:06.793 --> 37:09.118
- He had to sleep on a beach.
- l know you care about him.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.086
l do, Dad.

37:11.256 --> 37:13.414
l have to help him. Please, help me.

37:14.968 --> 37:19.214
Okay. Okay, okay.
lt's gonna be all right.

37:20.181 --> 37:21.924
We'll all take care of him.

37:22.099 --> 37:24.091
We will?

37:25.603 --> 37:28.176
You've just gotta understand,
Brenda,

37:28.939 --> 37:31.892
one minute, you're my little girl,

37:32.067 --> 37:35.020
and then all of a sudden
you're taking pregnancy tests.

37:36.321 --> 37:39.191
Things are moving kind of fast
for your old man.

37:40.742 --> 37:43.279
Well, maybe l'm not
your little girl anymore.

37:48.458 --> 37:50.450
You'll always be my little girl.

38:10.771 --> 38:11.802
Steve.

38:14.233 --> 38:16.902
- Steve, what is your problem?
- Man, what's the deal here?

38:17.236 --> 38:18.434
Hey, this is an A game.

38:18.612 --> 38:21.815
lf she can't take the heat,
then she shouldn't play.

38:27.829 --> 38:29.453
You know what your problem is,
Sanders?

38:29.622 --> 38:33.619
- You just don't know when to give up.
- l suggest you get off me.

38:35.295 --> 38:38.544
Mr. Macho, right.
You take a cheap first shot,

38:38.715 --> 38:41.252
and you can't even make it
with Kelly Taylor.

38:41.425 --> 38:42.539
What kind of a guy are you?

38:42.718 --> 38:45.754
For your information, Steve,
l was with Kyle last night.

38:45.930 --> 38:50.009
And he was wonderful,
in every way you can imagine.

38:54.021 --> 38:57.187
David, Donna, come on.
Let's get this show on the road.

38:57.357 --> 38:59.396
- Okay, we're ready.
- Okay.

38:59.568 --> 39:01.643
And curtains.

39:06.408 --> 39:10.903
O Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

39:11.079 --> 39:13.748
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

39:13.915 --> 39:16.584
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

39:16.751 --> 39:20.084
and l will no longer be a Capulet.

39:23.466 --> 39:27.712
Shall l hear more,
or shall l speak at this?

39:28.929 --> 39:31.846
'Tis thy name that is my enemy.

39:32.016 --> 39:33.723
But what's in a name?

39:33.892 --> 39:35.220
That which we call a rose,

39:35.394 --> 39:38.063
by any other name
would smell as sweet.

39:38.272 --> 39:41.972
Call me but love,
and l'll be new baptized.

39:42.192 --> 39:49.404
Henceforth, l never will be Romeo.

39:58.374 --> 40:00.995
Divine, David. Simply divine.

40:01.210 --> 40:05.289
And, Donna, no Romeo
ever looked quite so good in tights.

40:05.798 --> 40:09.249
You went for the easy laugh.
A total cop-out.

40:10.719 --> 40:12.592
But very funny.

40:12.763 --> 40:15.929
Well, l have to admit,
it was all David's idea, really.

40:17.142 --> 40:18.933
Well, that's very commendable,
David.

40:19.103 --> 40:21.807
But don't quit your day job just yet.

40:21.980 --> 40:24.731
And you're gonna do this again,
both of you.

40:24.900 --> 40:28.019
Only next time, do it straight.

40:32.282 --> 40:34.440
You know, you didn't have
to cover for me back there.

40:34.617 --> 40:35.648
Hey, it's cool.

40:35.827 --> 40:37.653
l'm not the kind of girl
to kiss and tell.

40:37.829 --> 40:40.284
Or not kiss and tell.

40:41.916 --> 40:45.082
Kelly, about the other night,
there's something l wanna tell you.

40:45.253 --> 40:48.088
Look, you don't owe me
any explanations.

40:48.714 --> 40:51.383
lt's something
l've never told anyone.

40:51.967 --> 40:53.626
What?

40:56.972 --> 40:58.514
Kelly.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.216
l've never slept with a girl before.

41:03.478 --> 41:07.392
So you're a virgin. lt's no big deal.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.808
No, you don't get it.

41:10.986 --> 41:12.895
Look, Kel, l--

41:14.114 --> 41:19.404
l've never slept with a girl before
and l don't know if l want to.

41:20.995 --> 41:22.654
You mean you're gay?

41:22.872 --> 41:26.075
No. l don't know, Kel.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.787
l just know that l wish
l would have been attracted to you.

41:29.003 --> 41:32.003
My life would be a lot less confusing
right now.

41:34.341 --> 41:36.333
Look,

41:36.510 --> 41:38.751
l don't want anybody
to know about this, all right?

41:38.971 --> 41:41.343
Sure, l understand.

41:43.016 --> 41:44.474
Why are you telling me this?

41:45.811 --> 41:47.055
Because l trust you.

41:52.108 --> 41:56.187
So the other night,
you were just kind of testing yourself?

41:57.155 --> 41:58.814
Yeah, l guess so.

41:58.990 --> 42:02.026
That's why l picked
the most beautiful girl on the beach.

42:03.619 --> 42:08.079
So l mean, it's not like you were
turning me down or anything, right?

42:08.249 --> 42:10.040
That's right.

42:11.877 --> 42:13.916
l can handle that.

42:16.006 --> 42:19.042
Dylan, l just talked to my old man.
He wants me to bring you home.

42:19.218 --> 42:20.676
Forget it. He threw me out.

42:20.844 --> 42:22.503
Well, he must have had
a change of heart.

42:22.679 --> 42:25.596
Dude,
l know when l'm not wanted, okay?

42:25.766 --> 42:28.885
Dylan,
if l don't bring you home with me,

42:29.061 --> 42:31.765
Brenda will never forgive my father.

42:31.938 --> 42:33.729
- Ever.
- Did you say never?

42:33.898 --> 42:35.273
l said never ever.

42:37.527 --> 42:40.314
- l saw Dylan's car parked out front.
- Hold on, honey.

42:40.488 --> 42:42.610
Your father's talking to him
in the living room.

42:42.782 --> 42:44.240
You're kidding.

42:44.409 --> 42:46.235
Whatever you said worked.

42:46.410 --> 42:49.825
- ls he staying?
- Well, l don't know.

42:49.997 --> 42:52.369
Let's just take it one meal at a time.

42:52.583 --> 42:55.832
Sounds like your father
got himself into a lot of trouble.

42:56.003 --> 42:59.585
Yeah. My dad was always
the man with the plan.

42:59.757 --> 43:01.215
Now everything's gone.

43:01.800 --> 43:04.172
Do you have
any assets of your own?

43:04.344 --> 43:06.253
My car.

43:07.431 --> 43:09.222
Not much else.

43:09.391 --> 43:12.427
- Cash?
- No.

43:13.436 --> 43:16.187
There must be some provisions
made for your support.

43:16.398 --> 43:20.477
Yeah. l'm supposed to go to Hawaii
and live with my mother.

43:20.652 --> 43:23.059
ln October, it'll be three years
since l've even seen her.

43:23.279 --> 43:26.445
l'm supposed to just walk in and say,
''Hi, Mom.''

43:27.992 --> 43:31.989
lf it'll make you feel any better,
you're welcome to stay here

43:32.163 --> 43:35.697
a little while longer
until you sort things out.

43:35.916 --> 43:38.952
l appreciate that. Thank you.

43:40.671 --> 43:43.874
l'm sorry l lost my temper
the other day.

43:44.716 --> 43:48.879
For a long time now, l've been
the only man in Brenda's life.

43:49.054 --> 43:51.461
lt's hard for me to accept
her growing up.

43:51.681 --> 43:53.258
Can l ask you something?

43:54.226 --> 43:55.340
Sure.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.766
Why do you always act
like l'm not good enough for her?

43:57.979 --> 44:00.849
Dylan,
l haven't been very fair with you.

44:02.192 --> 44:04.682
You have to realise
from where l stand,

44:04.861 --> 44:06.853
nobody would have been
good enough for Brenda.

44:08.489 --> 44:12.071
You know, they say
that girls always look for guys

44:12.243 --> 44:14.449
who remind them of their fathers.

44:15.788 --> 44:17.032
Let's not get carried away.

44:20.501 --> 44:23.916
- Have you talked to your father?
- No.

44:24.546 --> 44:26.503
He might be needing you
right about now.

44:27.132 --> 44:29.207
l don't know what to say to him.

44:29.426 --> 44:30.920
Just be honest.

44:35.682 --> 44:38.172
A long time ago,
you made a promise to me.

44:38.351 --> 44:42.015
You said you'd always be there,
that you'd never let me fall.

44:42.188 --> 44:44.560
And along the way, even when things
got rough between us,

44:44.732 --> 44:46.475
deep down, l believed you.

44:46.651 --> 44:49.568
Deep down,
l don't believe you anymore.

44:49.737 --> 44:53.070
But it doesn't matter,
because l still want a father.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.027
And l hope you
wanna have a son again.

44:56.202 --> 44:59.902
Your loving son, Dylan.

45:02.291 --> 45:03.666
Dylan?

45:05.919 --> 45:07.461
l just wanna say good night.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.587
Good night, Bren.

45:12.009 --> 45:13.668
Sleep well.
