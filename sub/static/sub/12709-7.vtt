WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:03.170
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.204 --> 00:04.538
-Tara?
-(yells)

00:04.572 --> 00:06.139
Willow, what did you do?

00:06.174 --> 00:07.908
We have to get you out of here,
or you'll both be killed.

00:07.939 --> 00:09.410
-What about Warren?
-She killed him.

00:09.442 --> 00:13.647
We gotta get out of this town.
Mexico. We should go to Mexico.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.516
-How did you do it?
-What is she talking about?

00:15.548 --> 00:17.150
-Nothing. Let's go.
-I can see you.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.053
BUFFY: You got your soul back.

00:19.086 --> 00:23.022
Cassie? Cassie? Cassie?

00:23.056 --> 00:25.725
This? Just
the beginning, love.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.096
Horror and bloodshed.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.897
From beneath you, it devours.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.972
(electronic hum)

00:47.914 --> 00:50.417
(tuning)

00:59.058 --> 01:01.462
WOMAN:
 * Night falls

01:01.494 --> 01:04.230
* I fall

01:04.265 --> 01:07.801
* And where were you?

01:07.834 --> 01:10.237
* And where were you?

01:10.271 --> 01:13.941
* Warm skin

01:13.974 --> 01:16.144
* Wolf grin

01:16.176 --> 01:20.948
* And where were you?

01:23.150 --> 01:27.120
* I fell into the moon

01:27.155 --> 01:30.591
* And it covered you

01:30.623 --> 01:34.427
* In blue

01:34.462 --> 01:38.831
* I fell into the moon

01:38.865 --> 01:42.002
* Can I make it right?

01:42.034 --> 01:48.575
* Can I spend the night?

01:48.609 --> 01:51.110
* High tide

01:51.145 --> 01:53.514
* Inside

01:53.546 --> 01:56.616
* The air is dew

01:56.650 --> 01:59.787
* And where were you?

01:59.819 --> 02:03.191
* Wild-eyed

02:03.224 --> 02:05.459
* I died

02:05.492 --> 02:11.131
* And where were you?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.867
* I crawled out

02:14.901 --> 02:17.170
* Of the world

02:17.204 --> 02:24.144
* When you said
 I shouldn't stay *

02:24.177 --> 02:26.280
* I crawled out

02:26.313 --> 02:28.316
* Of the world

02:28.348 --> 02:32.353
* Can I make it right?

02:32.385 --> 02:37.957
* Can I spend the night

02:37.990 --> 02:40.194
* Alone?

02:40.228 --> 02:41.895
Here we go.

02:44.397 --> 02:47.167
(theme music playing)

03:41.555 --> 03:45.259
You keep circling around.
Just-- Just drive straight in.
Will you shut up?

03:45.293 --> 03:47.227
Gotta keep it low pro.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.562
You're just scared.
Of course I'm scared.

03:49.597 --> 03:53.099
Last time we were here,
33.3 bar percent of us
were flayed alive.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.402
Calm down.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.236
No one's getting flayed alive.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.240
We've got a plan.
We're gonna fix all that.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.644
We should have stayed
in Mexico.

04:03.676 --> 04:08.581
I didn't like it there.
Everybody spoke Mexicoan.
You could have learned it.

04:08.615 --> 04:12.252
You learned
the entire Klingon dictionary
in two and a half weeks.

04:12.286 --> 04:16.557
That had much clearer transitive
and intransitive rules, okay?

04:16.589 --> 04:19.726
Besides, I can't keep
having those nightmares.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.194
Me neither.

04:23.630 --> 04:26.399
(speaks Spanish)

04:26.434 --> 04:29.769
"It eats you,
starting with your bottom."

04:31.704 --> 04:34.574
We're gonna
make it right.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.110
We're outlaws,
with hearts of gold.

04:56.564 --> 05:00.100
Anchovies, anchovies,
you're so delicious.

05:00.132 --> 05:02.336
I love you more
than all the other fishes.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.809
Oh! Ah.

05:08.841 --> 05:11.011
Hm.
She'll think it's blood.

05:11.043 --> 05:13.781
Taste my blade,
spawn of evil!

05:13.814 --> 05:16.850
(grunts)
 (stereo: man singing)

05:18.485 --> 05:24.425
* You see,
you fool everyone *

05:30.230 --> 05:32.098
(grunts, gasps)

05:33.600 --> 05:37.471
* Time will tell
what's in it for you *

05:37.504 --> 05:40.307
* I do my best,
don't need to--

05:40.340 --> 05:43.511
(upbeat instrumental)

05:46.045 --> 05:48.382
(volume increases)

06:02.262 --> 06:04.697
(beeps)

06:04.732 --> 06:06.266
(chuckling)
Cool.

06:08.601 --> 06:11.137
-(banging)
-(microwave beeping)

06:18.778 --> 06:22.314
So. This is the UC library, huh?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.187
It's so big.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.223
-Hey.
-I know you.

06:30.257 --> 06:34.927
-I mean, I saw your picture.
-Yeah.
(chuckles)

06:34.961 --> 06:40.132
I know. It's kinda weird
because we never really met.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.235
Or kinda weird
'cause you're really dead.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.204
-Yeah, well.
-Did I fall asleep?

06:45.237 --> 06:49.576
No, no, I'm here.
I mean, not-- not here here.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.480
It's kind of
complicated.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.380
Kind of ironic, too,
you know?

06:54.413 --> 06:58.586
I write all that
intense poetry
about the end,

06:58.619 --> 07:02.088
and here I am again,
chatting you up.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.625
Yeah. Ironic.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.959
I knew this would
completely freak you out.
It's just--

07:09.930 --> 07:12.800
She asked that
I come talk to you.
It's important.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.968
She?
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
hurt you or anything.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.271
Who asked you?
What are you talking about?

07:20.206 --> 07:22.675
She says she still sings.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.079
What?

07:26.112 --> 07:28.615
Remember that time
on the bridge when you
sang to each other?

07:28.649 --> 07:33.120
Well, she says even though
you can't hear it,

07:33.153 --> 07:37.290
she still sings to you.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.259
Tara?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.095
Oh, come on!
She is so dead.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.932
Well, he's clearly
a psychopath.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.000
(screams)
Is so!

07:48.034 --> 07:51.237
What?
No, that is not Tom Hanks.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.845
Well, what channel
are y on?

07:57.877 --> 07:59.812
(loud banging)
(gasps)

07:59.846 --> 08:03.651
Okay, there it is again.
I keep hearing this, like,
thumping.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.555
(banging)

08:08.588 --> 08:10.389
No.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.360
I can't tell if it's--

08:13.393 --> 08:16.228
(gasping, screams)

08:16.262 --> 08:18.331
Kit! Are you there?

08:20.067 --> 08:22.636
Is there a storm?

08:22.670 --> 08:25.172
(screaming)

08:27.740 --> 08:28.908
(phone beeps)

08:35.849 --> 08:37.517
(grunts)

08:38.085 --> 08:40.553
(growls)

08:42.188 --> 08:43.789
(growling)

08:50.697 --> 08:53.299
No!
(growls)

08:55.735 --> 08:58.504
Buffy?
(laughs)

08:58.538 --> 09:00.039
Buffy Summers?
Have we--

09:00.072 --> 09:04.076
Oh, uh-- Webs.
Holden Webster.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.413
We went to school together.
European History.

09:06.446 --> 09:10.017
I let you crib off
my Vaclav Havel essay
that time.

09:10.049 --> 09:14.922
-You really don't remember me?
-Sure. Sure.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.658
-(upbeat instrumental)
 -(rock)

09:29.903 --> 09:31.838
(upbeat instrumental
 continues)

09:37.911 --> 09:39.578
(sparking)
Oh, god.

09:41.413 --> 09:43.182
Oh, god.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.118
(screaming)

09:50.256 --> 09:52.225
(static crackling)

09:52.259 --> 09:54.961
WOMAN:
Dawn?

09:54.995 --> 09:57.397
(upbeat instrumental
 continues)

09:57.429 --> 09:59.866
Mom?

10:03.803 --> 10:05.471
Okay, um,

10:05.504 --> 10:08.075
junior year,
spring production of Pippin.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.644
I-I did
the lighting design.

10:11.678 --> 10:14.480
I didn't see it.
But you helped me move
the lighting board,

10:14.514 --> 10:17.484
and I dropped it
on your foot.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.619
Right! Foot.
Yes, of course.

10:19.653 --> 10:23.123
History class.
It's all coming back.
Sorry.

10:23.155 --> 10:26.759
Oh, well, you know,
it's not like I was a big part
of your life or anything.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.797
No, I-I just--
I didn't recognize you.

10:29.830 --> 10:33.133
Your face all demon,
and I think you
filled out a lot.

10:33.165 --> 10:37.636
Oh, yeah.
Well, I got into tae kwon do
in a big way at Dartmouth.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.307
That's great.
Yeah.

10:40.340 --> 10:44.376
So, what have you
been up to?
Well, apparently dying.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.313
(laughing)
No, but other stuff.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.883
Um, majoring in psych.
Really liking that.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.619
Uh, I took a year off

10:52.652 --> 10:55.788
to do an internship
at the Sunnydale
Mental Hospital.

10:55.822 --> 10:59.392
Wow. That's gotta be
a... popular joint.

10:59.426 --> 11:03.462
(chuckles)
I keep telling them we oughta
get a velvet rope and a bouncer.

11:03.495 --> 11:06.133
Hey, do you remember
Jason Wheeler?
You know, "Crazy J"?

11:06.166 --> 11:10.070
Oh, yeah.
He always had that shtick.
"Oh, I'm crazy! I'm crazy!"

11:10.102 --> 11:12.504
How is he?
Crazy.

11:12.538 --> 11:16.243
He's been in the chronic ward
since graduation.
(laughs)

11:16.275 --> 11:19.178
Not really that funny,
I guess.

11:19.211 --> 11:22.081
Ironic, sort of.
Yeah.

11:24.683 --> 11:28.587
Whoa.
Did my face just change?
Yeah, you look human now.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.724
You can do that--
go back and forth.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.860
Oh, so I'm a vampire.
How weird is that?

11:33.894 --> 11:36.363
Sorry.
No, no.

11:36.395 --> 11:39.066
It feels great, strong.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.369
Like I'm connected
to a powerful,
all-consuming evil

11:42.402 --> 11:45.004
that's gonna suck the world
into a fiery oblivion.

11:45.038 --> 11:49.042
How about you?
Not so much connected.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.778
No, no, I mean--

11:51.812 --> 11:54.847
You know, with the stake
and the cross.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.649
You do this kind of thing
a lot?

11:58.485 --> 12:01.453
I'm the Slayer.
It's sort of a thing.

12:01.488 --> 12:05.424
So, what?
You, like, fight vampires
professionally?

12:05.457 --> 12:08.695
I don't get paid.
It's more like a calling.

12:08.727 --> 12:12.432
Since--
even in school.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.601
I heard a lot of rumors
about you back then.
You were all mysterious.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.736
I was?
Well, you were never around.

12:17.770 --> 12:22.075
A lot of kids thought you
were dating some really old guy,
or you were heavy religious.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.912
Scott Hope said
you were gay.
What?

12:24.945 --> 12:28.215
I dated that ringworm.
He says that about every girl
he breaks up with.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.051
And then, last year--
big surprise-- he comes out.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.885
(chuckles)

12:32.919 --> 12:35.822
Men. Do I know
how to pick 'em...

12:35.855 --> 12:39.225
So, all that time
you were a Slayer?

12:39.259 --> 12:43.062
The.
"The," like as in
"the only one"?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.798
Pretty much.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.633
Huh.

12:46.665 --> 12:51.104
So, when you said
"not connected," that was
kind of a telling statement.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.140
-Ah, Psych 101 alert.
-Well, I'm just sayin'.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.609
What I really need
is emotional therapy
from the evil dead.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.846
Hey, it was your phrase.
I'm connected.

12:58.879 --> 13:02.481
I'm connected to
a lot of people, okay?
No, I hear you.

13:02.514 --> 13:04.783
I really am!
(ringing)

13:04.817 --> 13:08.822
Buffy! Come on, pick up.
I don't know what to do.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.394
Do it again!
I heard you.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.472
(rattling)

13:26.505 --> 13:28.174
(gasps)

13:34.881 --> 13:36.716
(loud banging)

13:38.851 --> 13:40.220
(ragged breathing)

13:43.190 --> 13:44.857
(loud banging)

13:44.892 --> 13:47.726
Why are you doing this?

13:49.028 --> 13:52.698
Why are you--
I don't understand!

13:52.731 --> 13:56.036
Stop! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop!

13:56.068 --> 13:58.504
(banging stops)

14:07.047 --> 14:09.216
Hello?
(banging)

14:12.919 --> 14:16.389
Once... for yes.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.991
Once for yes!

14:19.025 --> 14:21.528
Twice for no!

14:25.398 --> 14:27.600
Mom?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.701
(one bang)

14:31.738 --> 14:33.706
Mom?

14:34.908 --> 14:37.911
It's you?
(one bang)

14:41.780 --> 14:44.051
Are you okay?

14:44.084 --> 14:48.687
(two bangs)
You're not.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.590
Mom?

14:52.591 --> 14:54.461
Mommy?

14:58.130 --> 15:00.432
Are you alone?

15:00.466 --> 15:02.902
(two bangs)

15:02.936 --> 15:04.903
(sighs)

15:06.905 --> 15:09.042
(screams)

15:09.076 --> 15:11.910
Why are you doing this?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.826
(screaming)

15:29.096 --> 15:31.331
Get up, you wuss.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.701
I have shin splints.
Ow.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.272
Maybe we should
turn on a light.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.673
No, no. They'll see it
from outside.
Right.

15:41.707 --> 15:44.244
(clattering)

15:44.277 --> 15:47.080
Maybe we should
go get Buffy.
No way.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.948
We should just tell her
what we know about
the Seal of Danzalthar.

15:49.982 --> 15:53.120
Think, McFly.
Why would she believe us
without any proof?

15:53.153 --> 15:55.788
We go to her empty-handed,
we'll be cooling our heels
in the clink

15:55.822 --> 15:57.356
in a Bell's microsecond.

15:57.389 --> 16:01.594
I ain't going back
to the big house.
That place changes a man.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.863
That's why
we need proof.

16:03.962 --> 16:07.500
Think of it
as a trial by fire.
A quest.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.436
Una questa.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.672
We find it,
we alert the Slayer,
we help her destroy it.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.542
We save Sunnydale.

16:15.575 --> 16:19.111
Then we join her gang
and possibly hang out
at her house.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.447
Right. Okay.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.482
What do we do?

16:23.515 --> 16:27.287
I think we should find
the principal's office and
work our way down from there.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.190
Okay, uh-- um-- uh--

16:30.222 --> 16:33.092
You go check down the hallway,
and I'll go over there.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.528
Check communications?

16:40.732 --> 16:42.369
(echoing)
Check, check.
Check, check.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.803
Check.
Check, check.
Check, check. Check.

16:44.836 --> 16:46.673
Check.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.543
Echo 2 to Echo 1.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.980
This is Echo 1.
Go ahead.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.084
Do you think they'll really
let us join their gang?

17:03.923 --> 17:05.525
Nice job.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.730
There you are.
I'm scared out of
my freakin' gourd here.

17:11.762 --> 17:16.536
-Take it easy. Take it easy.
-Do you have any idea how hard
it's been to act this cool?

17:16.568 --> 17:20.006
Calm down. You're doing great.
All specs are within parameters.

17:20.038 --> 17:23.675
You keep leaving me.
I hate it when you leave me.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.713
One time you died,
and I ended up a Mexican.
We've been over this.

17:27.747 --> 17:31.250
Now, that death thing
was all part
of the master plan.

17:31.284 --> 17:35.954
Come on.
"If you strike me down..."

17:35.988 --> 17:40.759
"I shall become more powerful
than you could possibly
imagine." Of course.

17:40.792 --> 17:44.797
Do you think maybe Willow
could kill me, too?
Hey, don't worry.

17:44.830 --> 17:48.934
If Short Round pulls off
his end of the bargain,
we'll both become gods.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.772
"That boy
is our last hope."

17:55.307 --> 17:58.744
"No.
There is another."

17:58.778 --> 18:02.615
Wait. Really?
Who's our last hope?
No, I was just goin' with it.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.417
It was a thing.
No, he's our last hope.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.953
Tara, is it you?

18:10.257 --> 18:12.759
She's sorry she couldn't
come herself.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.461
Why didn't she?
I don't understand.

18:15.494 --> 18:19.165
I mean, if you can
manifest yourself.
She just can't.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.269
Why not?
I don't understand.

18:22.301 --> 18:26.338
Because
of what you did.
What?

18:26.373 --> 18:29.342
You killed people.
You can't see her.

18:30.942 --> 18:34.646
It's just how it is.
I'm sorry.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.916
But-- But she's
talking to you?

18:37.950 --> 18:41.119
And--
And she can hear me?

18:43.855 --> 18:45.157
Tara?

18:46.159 --> 18:49.095
Tara, I miss you.

18:49.127 --> 18:52.332
I miss you so much.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.233
Can she hear me?

18:57.636 --> 19:01.173
What's happening?
Did she say anything?

19:03.242 --> 19:06.378
What? Did she go away?

19:06.413 --> 19:08.615
She's crying.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.218
No. No, don't cry.

19:11.250 --> 19:14.186
Don't cry, sweetie.
Talk to me.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.623
She misses you, too.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.992
-She wishes
she could touch you.
-Me, too.

19:21.027 --> 19:25.664
Oh, me, too.
Oh, god, Tara.

19:25.698 --> 19:30.169
It hurts so much.
Every day.

19:30.202 --> 19:33.072
It's-- It's like
this giant hole,

19:34.874 --> 19:37.210
and it's not getting better.

19:37.243 --> 19:40.011
It will. It can.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.682
How? You're gone.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.518
But you're not.

19:45.551 --> 19:49.388
You're strong,
like an Amazon, remember?

19:51.089 --> 19:54.794
I do. I remember.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.949
HOLDEN:
So, you meet someone,
you form a bond.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.452
But it never lasts.

20:20.487 --> 20:24.190
Do you mean
all relationships
or just yours?

20:24.222 --> 20:28.227
My parents weren't
exactly the paragon
of stay togethery-ness.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.896
Maybe that's part of it.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.098
I think there are people
out there who'd make it.

20:33.132 --> 20:36.903
I just target
the impossible ones,

20:36.935 --> 20:38.938
with deadly accuracy.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.775
You think you do that
on purpose?

20:42.808 --> 20:45.877
Maybe you're trying
to protect yourself?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.114
Protecting myself...

20:48.146 --> 20:53.251
from heartbreak,
misery, sexual violence,
and possible death?

20:53.286 --> 20:55.422
Not so much.
From committing.

20:55.454 --> 20:59.726
I commit.
I'm committed.
I'm a committee.

20:59.759 --> 21:03.395
So, it's them.
You're reaching out.
They're just not coming through.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.798
Oh, it's different.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.634
I think you're confusing me
because you're evil.

21:08.667 --> 21:13.573
I just think you're in some
pain here, which I do kind of
enjoy 'cause I'm evil now.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.775
But you should just
ease up on yourself.

21:15.807 --> 21:19.311
It's not exactly
like you have the patent
on bad relationships.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.647
Wouldn't it be cool
if I did?

21:21.681 --> 21:24.784
And what, are you supposed
to be settling down already?

21:24.817 --> 21:28.186
At 21?
You know, my girlfriend
at college, she's so sweet.

21:28.220 --> 21:32.090
We have this great thing,
but that doesn't mean I'm
gonna go vampify her

21:32.124 --> 21:34.259
just so we can
be together forever.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.862
Sire.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.529
What?
The word.

21:37.564 --> 21:41.433
When you turn
a human into a vampire,
it's you "sire" them.

21:41.468 --> 21:44.871
Cool.
It's a noun, too.

21:44.903 --> 21:49.174
Oh, I have so much to learn.
Come on! Isn't this insane?

21:49.208 --> 21:52.010
I mean,
I was afraid to talk to you
in high school.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.212
And now we're, like,
mortal enemies.

21:54.246 --> 21:59.818
Hey, wouldn't it be cool
if we became nemeses?
Is that how you say the word?

21:59.852 --> 22:01.653
We're gonna have to fight
to the death, aren't we?

22:02.721 --> 22:06.393
-It's the time-honored custom.
-Wow.

22:06.425 --> 22:09.194
Reality just shows up
sometimes, doesn't it?

22:09.228 --> 22:12.999
But you know,
I got the blood lust pumpin',
and I kind of get it.

22:13.031 --> 22:17.804
I'm looking for a fight.
Oh, it's nothing personal.
No, you've been great.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.672
And fun catching up.

22:19.705 --> 22:22.375
I haven't really kept in contact
with many of my friends
from high school.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.276
Guess I'll be
looking them up
pretty soon.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.012
Yeah.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.150
Hey, I don't mean
to be Count Buttinsky here,

22:31.182 --> 22:34.220
but you just don't
seem as thrilled.

22:34.252 --> 22:36.923
Is it because
we're gonna fight?

22:36.955 --> 22:40.492
It's 'cause
I'm gonna win.
(laughing)

22:40.527 --> 22:44.697
Hello.
Two years of tae kwon do
and vampire strength.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.932
I think somebody's
countin' their chickens.

22:46.965 --> 22:50.036
You're not leaving
this graveyard.
Can't let you.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.439
Do the words
"superiority complex"
mean anything to you?

22:52.471 --> 22:55.508
Do you think I'm gonna let you
go kill a bunch of people?
You know I'm sworn--

22:55.541 --> 22:57.743
No. I get the battle against
evil. That's not the issue.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.711
There is no issue.
Don't issue me.

22:59.746 --> 23:04.049
Just answer me this:
Whose fault was
your parents' divorce?

23:04.083 --> 23:07.353
Okay, you know what?
This is beyond evil.
This is insane troll logic.

23:07.385 --> 23:10.288
What do my parents
have to do with--
I'm just curious.

23:10.321 --> 23:13.593
Your opinion.
(sighs)
They both had a lot of--

23:13.625 --> 23:15.961
Off the top
of your head.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.467
My dad.
Uh-huh.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.070
He cheated.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.673
I-- I think
he cheated.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.741
So...

23:30.843 --> 23:32.878
of all of these
relationships of yours

23:32.912 --> 23:37.148
that you knew,
subconsciously,
were totally doomed,

23:37.182 --> 23:38.917
whose fault is that?

23:39.919 --> 23:42.087
It's incredibly different.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.222
I was just wondering.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.393
Is it possible,
even a little bit,

23:47.425 --> 23:50.663
that the reason
you have trouble
connecting to guys

23:50.697 --> 23:54.834
is because you think
maybe they're not worth it?

23:54.866 --> 23:57.435
Maybe you think
you're better than them.

23:57.470 --> 24:01.007
-Say, there's that blood lust
I was looking for.
-Struck a nerve.

24:01.039 --> 24:04.175
I'm gonna strike
a nerve cluster in a minute,
you don't get off this.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.246
I don't remember you
being this annoying.
You don't remember me at all.

24:07.278 --> 24:10.415
Yes, I do.
Yeah, like, after
30 minutes of reminding.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.854
I don't take it personally
because clearly you were in your
own little world in high school,

24:14.886 --> 24:17.123
all chosen,
all destiny.

24:17.155 --> 24:21.594
Who could live with that
for seven years
and not feel superior?

24:21.627 --> 24:23.295
I'm not.

24:23.328 --> 24:26.532
My god, if anything, I--

24:26.566 --> 24:29.201
What?
I just--

24:31.671 --> 24:35.207
(sighs)
If you knew
what I've done,

24:35.240 --> 24:39.546
what I've let myself
become.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.847
My best friends
don't even--

24:43.750 --> 24:47.185
You'd laugh if you heard
some of the things
I've done to them.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.221
Buffy,

24:50.757 --> 24:54.160
I'm here to kill you,
not to judge you.

24:54.192 --> 24:56.828
The last guy I was with,
it got really--

24:59.932 --> 25:02.034
I behaved like a monster,

25:03.234 --> 25:04.671
treated him like--

25:07.574 --> 25:10.509
And at the same time,

25:10.542 --> 25:14.681
I let him completely
take me over,

25:14.713 --> 25:17.616
do things to me that--

25:20.352 --> 25:22.922
(sniffles)
I'm sorry.

25:22.954 --> 25:26.593
Wow, I didn't mean to
get all true confessions
on you there.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.760
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

25:30.797 --> 25:33.132
There's nothing wrong
with you.

25:38.403 --> 25:41.307
Everyone's got issues.
(growls)

25:54.052 --> 25:56.122
-You son of a bitch.
-What?

25:56.154 --> 25:59.391
I think I'm gonna kill you
just a little bit more
than usual.

26:01.728 --> 26:05.131
Aw, come on.
I mean, we had a moment.

26:05.163 --> 26:07.799
You opened up.
It was really sweet.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.435
It made me want to bite you.
I'm sorry if I overstepped
my bounds.

26:10.469 --> 26:13.138
I'm just new to this
whole mortal enemy stuff.
(growls)

26:13.172 --> 26:16.575
-(grunts)
-Pretty fast learner,
though, right?

26:25.416 --> 26:28.119
(low growling)
I hear you.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.660
I hear you breathing.

26:38.497 --> 26:39.832
Are you hurting my mother?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.836
Are you keeping her
from coming back to me?

26:44.536 --> 26:48.641
(gasps)
Mom?

26:49.675 --> 26:52.912
I-- I see you.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.948
-I'm coming towards you, okay?
-(screaming)

26:57.817 --> 27:01.420
She's trying to talk to me!

27:01.452 --> 27:04.289
Get off her
and let her talk to me!

27:08.359 --> 27:10.296
The ax.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.669
(screaming)

27:17.737 --> 27:20.571
MALE VOICE:
Get out!

27:22.208 --> 27:23.474
No!

27:28.346 --> 27:31.250
She's my mother.
I'm staying.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.855
Seeing the high school
again,

27:35.887 --> 27:37.990
a part of me wishes
I could go back.

27:38.023 --> 27:41.359
Everything's shifting around.
I feel like we're
in Hellraiser.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.994
I hate Pinhead.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.529
Don't say that.

27:46.332 --> 27:50.201
We circled
all the way around?
Maybe we should start over.

27:50.236 --> 27:54.673
-There it is.
-What? Are you sure?

27:56.541 --> 27:58.344
Yeah.

28:05.384 --> 28:09.020
You know, I think
you may be right.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.825
If this lines up,

28:12.858 --> 28:16.428
what we're looking for
should be right...
under there.

28:24.470 --> 28:28.039
See? You're dead.
That enough of a moment
for you?

28:30.541 --> 28:34.579
Okay, but are you killing me
'cause I'm evil
or because you opened up?

28:34.613 --> 28:36.382
(exhales, frustrated grunt)

28:42.587 --> 28:44.455
(chuckling)

28:46.992 --> 28:49.461
What is wrong with you?

28:49.494 --> 28:52.765
Nothing.
I got no worries.
I'm dead.

28:52.798 --> 28:56.434
Biggest thing on my mind is
whether or not Trisha Waldman
came to my funeral or not.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.538
You remember her.
Oh! Biteable.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.941
See, this is what I hate
about you vampires.

29:01.973 --> 29:04.710
Sex and death
and love and pain.

29:04.742 --> 29:06.813
It's all the same
damn thing to you.

29:06.846 --> 29:11.150
Well, you know, it's kind of
a guy thing. We talk about
nailing a girl. There's all--

29:11.182 --> 29:13.051
No, it is not the same.

29:13.085 --> 29:16.823
With vampires,
it is completely--
Believe me, I know.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.758
Oh, my god.

29:19.791 --> 29:22.294
Oh, your god, what?

29:22.327 --> 29:26.265
Oh, well, you know,
notgod because I defy him
and all of his works.

29:26.298 --> 29:29.567
Does he exist?
Is there word on that,
by the way?

29:29.601 --> 29:32.070
Nothing solid.
Oh.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.074
I keep getting off topic
'cause my mind is just racing.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.309
All right.
I'll make a deal with you.

29:38.344 --> 29:42.914
We fight to the death, great.
That last fight was
just exhilarating!

29:42.949 --> 29:45.750
And I actually
had a move coming up
to block that stake.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.752
But you have to answer
one question,

29:47.786 --> 29:50.622
and if I'm right,
I get to ask anything.

29:50.655 --> 29:54.393
No secrets.
No defensiveness.
Anything I want to know.

29:56.494 --> 29:58.830
What's your question?

29:58.865 --> 30:02.969
Your last relationship--
was it with a vampire?

30:11.809 --> 30:13.179
WILLOW:
I don't know where to start.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.981
Um, after Warren shot you--

30:16.015 --> 30:19.117
You know all about that,
what happened?

30:19.151 --> 30:22.888
It was horrible.
I was horrible.

30:22.922 --> 30:26.057
I lost myself,
the regular me.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.559
Well, you were grieving.

30:28.594 --> 30:31.897
A lot of people grieve.
They don't make with
the flaying.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.900
I hurt so many people.

30:33.932 --> 30:38.871
It was the power.
But I am the power.
I-It's in me.

30:38.971 --> 30:42.141
Did I mention
the random destruction
of property?

30:42.173 --> 30:44.175
The Magic Box is not
so much a box now.

30:44.210 --> 30:47.413
-The power is bigger
than you are.
-I know.

30:47.445 --> 30:49.882
Things are more clear
where Tara is,

30:49.915 --> 30:52.483
where we are.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.121
We can see your path,
and you have to stop.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.657
You can't use magic again,
not ever.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.327
Black magic, of course,

31:02.361 --> 31:06.865
but Giles says it isn't
as simple as quitting it all
cold turkey.

31:06.898 --> 31:11.202
It's too dangerous.
You can't take the chance
that you'll lose control.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.872
I-I don't want to.
I-I can't.

31:13.905 --> 31:18.277
-I never want to cause
that kind of pain.
-Of course you don't.

31:18.309 --> 31:22.413
So, I won't.
I'm gonna be okay.

31:24.615 --> 31:28.686
-She says--
-What?

31:28.720 --> 31:32.324
You're not gonna be okay.
You're gonna kill everybody.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.978
-We almost got
this thing uncovered.
-Yup.

31:53.945 --> 31:59.250
I hope Buffy will know
how to destroy it.
36-19-27. That's it!

31:59.285 --> 32:04.155
That was my locker combination.
It's been bugging me all night.

32:04.190 --> 32:07.459
Dude, I've spent the last
few years trying to forget
about high school.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.795
-Why are you trying so hard
to remember it?
-I don't know.

32:09.827 --> 32:12.064
I guess I miss it.
Don't you?

32:12.097 --> 32:14.000
Yeah, I really miss it.

32:14.032 --> 32:16.268
No, I'm serious.
I really miss it.

32:16.301 --> 32:19.270
Time goes by,
and everything drops away.

32:19.305 --> 32:23.342
All the cruelty,
all the pain,
all the humiliation.

32:23.375 --> 32:27.913
It all washes away.
I miss my friends.

32:27.945 --> 32:29.681
I miss my enemies.

32:29.714 --> 32:31.250
I miss the people
I talked to everyday.

32:31.282 --> 32:34.420
I miss the people
who never knew
I existed.

32:34.452 --> 32:37.256
I miss 'em all.

32:37.288 --> 32:40.159
I want to talk to them,
you know?

32:40.192 --> 32:42.193
I want to find out
how they're doing.

32:42.228 --> 32:45.864
I want to know
what's going on
in their lives.

32:45.896 --> 32:49.701
You know what?
They don't want
to talk to you.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.769
All those people
you just mentioned?

32:51.802 --> 32:53.471
Not one of them
is sitting around going,

32:53.505 --> 32:57.675
"I wonder what Jonathan's
up to right now?"

32:57.709 --> 33:00.645
Not one of them
cares about you.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.651
Well, I still care
about them.

33:05.683 --> 33:07.885
That's why I'm here.

33:15.426 --> 33:18.997
(growling)
DAWN:
I know you're there.

33:19.030 --> 33:23.501
I will cast you out.
My mother needs to talk to me.

33:23.535 --> 33:26.837
(faint howling)

33:26.872 --> 33:28.839
(screaming)

33:28.874 --> 33:32.544
Ah. I cast you
from this place!

33:32.577 --> 33:35.513
It is your poison
and your bane!

33:35.547 --> 33:38.650
(whip cracking)
(screams)

33:38.683 --> 33:42.188
It is the skin that is cut
from your flesh!
(screams)

33:43.288 --> 33:44.756
(screams)

33:49.694 --> 33:50.862
(screams)

33:52.564 --> 33:54.900
And the joke is...

33:54.932 --> 33:57.169
he loved me.

33:57.202 --> 34:01.006
I mean, in his own
sick, soulless way,

34:01.038 --> 34:04.041
he really did
care for me.

34:04.076 --> 34:07.246
But I-I didn't want
to be loved.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.547
Didn't you?

34:09.581 --> 34:13.219
I have all this power.

34:13.251 --> 34:16.288
I didn't ask for it.
I don't deserve it.

34:16.322 --> 34:21.260
It's like I wanted
to be punished.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.996
I wanted to hurt
like I thought I deserved.

34:29.434 --> 34:32.103
I sort of think--

34:32.137 --> 34:34.239
You know, this is, um,
complicated.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.806
If you'd rather
just fight.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.143
Tell me.

34:39.177 --> 34:41.980
I feel like
I'm worse than anyone.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.784
Honestly, I--
I'm beneath them.

34:47.119 --> 34:51.222
My friends,
my boyfriends.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.992
I feel like I'm not worthy
of their love.

34:55.293 --> 34:59.130
'Cause even though
they love me,

34:59.164 --> 35:01.400
it doesn't mean anything,

35:01.432 --> 35:05.304
because their opinions
don't matter.

35:05.336 --> 35:07.773
They don't know.

35:07.806 --> 35:11.409
They haven't been through
what I've been through.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.911
They're not the Slayer.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.847
I am.

35:17.648 --> 35:20.652
Sometimes I feel--

35:20.686 --> 35:23.188
(sighs)
This is awful.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.394
I feel like
I'm better than them.

35:31.862 --> 35:34.132
Superior.

35:36.067 --> 35:38.836
Until you can't win.

35:38.869 --> 35:40.938
And I thought
I was diabolical.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.875
Or at least
I plan to be.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.943
You do have
a superiority complex,

35:45.976 --> 35:49.847
and you've got
an inferiority complex
about it.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.449
Kudos.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.353
It doesn't make
any sense.

35:54.385 --> 35:58.489
Oh. It makes
every kind of sense.

35:59.557 --> 36:02.393
And it all adds up
to you feeling alone.

36:02.427 --> 36:06.498
But, Buffy,
everybody feels alone.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.568
Everybody is,
until you die.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.005
Speaking of--

36:15.039 --> 36:18.577
You ready for
our little death match?
(grunting, exhales)

36:18.610 --> 36:20.110
I suppose.

36:21.746 --> 36:25.717
Uh, thanks
for listening.

36:25.751 --> 36:29.221
Oh, you know,
there's some things you can
only tell a stranger.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.188
You're not a stranger.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.860
-That stuff with Spike,
it's pretty--
-Hold it.

36:35.893 --> 36:39.530
-What?
-Did you say "Spike"?

36:54.211 --> 36:57.215
I cast you out
with every prayer,

36:57.248 --> 37:00.085
from every god
that walks the earth
and crawls beneath!

37:00.117 --> 37:02.920
(growls)

37:02.954 --> 37:07.893
I cast you out
with the strength
of those who love me!

37:07.925 --> 37:12.463
I cast you out
with the strength
I have inside me!

37:12.498 --> 37:15.467
And I cast you out
into the void!

37:15.501 --> 37:18.804
(shrieking)
That's right!
Die, you bastard!

37:18.836 --> 37:21.507
(howling)

37:30.148 --> 37:33.918
(whimpers, groans)

37:51.469 --> 37:52.704
Mom?

37:53.672 --> 37:55.005
I'm gonna what?

37:55.039 --> 37:57.275
That's why I came.
We needed to warn you.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.344
You saw my path?

37:59.378 --> 38:03.014
What do you know?
Wh-What did you see?

38:03.047 --> 38:06.150
You don't want to know
what we saw.
Oh, god.

38:06.184 --> 38:09.286
But if you stop completely,
no more magic--

38:09.320 --> 38:12.257
Right. Right. Stop.

38:12.289 --> 38:13.958
Wh-What about Giles?

38:13.992 --> 38:17.295
He made it seem like
it was just as dangerous
for me to quit completely,

38:17.396 --> 38:18.996
like I'll go off
the deep end again--

38:19.030 --> 38:22.967
You can't.
If you do so much
as another spell--

38:23.001 --> 38:26.637
I tried to stop. I-I tried.
What if I can't do this?

38:26.672 --> 38:29.974
Don't think that way.
Well, how can I not?

38:30.007 --> 38:32.610
You're telling me
I'm gonna murder
all my friends.

38:32.643 --> 38:37.081
I'm not strong.
I'm not an Amazon.
I'm just me.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.552
There is one thing,

38:41.586 --> 38:44.222
one thing you could do
to stop it.

38:44.255 --> 38:47.626
-What? Anything.
-Then you could see her.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.061
-You wouldn't have
to talk through me.
-Tara.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.831
-That's what you want,
isn't it?
-Of course.

38:53.864 --> 38:55.800
So go, be with her.

38:55.833 --> 39:00.338
Everybody will be safe,
and you'll be together again.

39:00.371 --> 39:02.673
It's not that bad.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.976
Really.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.413
It's just like
going to sleep.

39:14.952 --> 39:16.186
Who are you?

39:16.221 --> 39:18.724
What do you mean?
How do you know Spike?

39:18.757 --> 39:23.360
What do you mean "how"?
He was the guy that, um--
Oh, what's the word?

39:23.394 --> 39:26.731
-Sired.
-Yeah. He was the guy
that sired me.

39:26.764 --> 39:28.065
(growling)

39:35.574 --> 39:36.907
Things are coming, Dawn.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.411
Listen, things
are on their way.

39:39.445 --> 39:42.780
I love you,
and I love Buffy,

39:42.813 --> 39:45.717
but she won't
be there for you.

39:45.751 --> 39:48.686
What? Why are you--

39:48.719 --> 39:52.791
When it's bad,
Buffy won't choose you.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.492
She'll be against you.

39:59.329 --> 40:02.467
No! No, don't go!

40:02.501 --> 40:05.637
Please don't go!

40:05.670 --> 40:08.306
(sobs)
No.

40:08.338 --> 40:10.842
Oh.

40:22.454 --> 40:25.724
The suicide thing
was too far, huh?

40:25.757 --> 40:28.494
Hm.
You seemed so ripe.

40:28.527 --> 40:33.231
-Tell me who you are.
-I stand by my opinion.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.400
The world would be
a better place if you took
a razor blade to your wrist.

40:36.434 --> 40:40.938
-Stop.
-I can see it now.

40:40.972 --> 40:45.143
Candlelight.
The Indigo Girls playing.

40:45.175 --> 40:48.679
-A picture of your dead
girlfriend on your bloody lap.
-Stop it.

40:48.713 --> 40:52.550
Oh, baby,
you left such a big hole.
It hurts so bad!

40:54.318 --> 40:56.420
You don't know hurt.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.824
This last year is gonna seem
like cake after what I put you
and your friends through,

40:59.858 --> 41:02.159
and I am not a fan
of easy death.

41:02.193 --> 41:05.697
Fact is,
the whole good versus evil,
balancing the scales thing?

41:05.731 --> 41:09.034
I'm over it.
I'm done with
the mortal coil.

41:09.067 --> 41:12.871
But believe me,
I'm going for a big finish.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.643
"From beneath you,
it devours."

41:17.675 --> 41:21.378
Oh, not it. Me.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.987
(growling)

41:46.237 --> 41:50.208
* I fell into the moon

41:50.240 --> 41:52.844
* And it covered you

41:52.878 --> 41:57.648
* In blue

41:57.682 --> 42:01.820
* I fell into the moon

42:01.853 --> 42:04.889
* Can I make it right?

42:04.922 --> 42:11.061
* Can I spend the night

42:11.096 --> 42:13.731
* Alone?

42:37.755 --> 42:40.626
Grr! Arrgh!
