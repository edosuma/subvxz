HEY.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.159
WHAT YOU LOOKING AT, HUH?

01:17.445 --> 01:20.148
- YOU NEED TO GET ON
FROM THIS PLACE.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.157
- GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.459
- I'VE BEEN PRAYING
THE BLOOD OF JESUS OVER YOU,

01:31.492 --> 01:35.163
THE MISSUS, AND THE BABY.

01:35.163 --> 01:38.799
BUT I AIN'T STRONG ENOUGH
FOR WHATEVER COMING NEXT.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.202
- YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

01:43.871 --> 01:47.175
- ME AND THEM--THEY CAN BURY US
IN THAT BLOWED-UP MOUNTAIN.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.177
- YEAH, WELL,
I GOT AN IDEA ABOUT THAT--

01:49.210 --> 01:51.179
- THAT DON'T MATTER NONE.

01:52.313 --> 01:56.417
YOU AND HER AND THE BABY...

01:58.352 --> 02:00.654
YOU STILL GOT A CHANCE.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.492
GO.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.667

03:00.881 --> 03:04.885
SOMEBODY LEFT YOU FOR DEAD.
DID YOU SEE 'EM?

03:04.918 --> 03:06.887
- IT WAS ONE
OF CAMPBELL'S MEN.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.923
- WELL, SCALP'S GONNA NEED
SOME STITCHES.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.892
BEST GET YOU TO THE DOCTOR.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.562

NO, NO, NO, NO.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.430
THERE'S...

03:16.464 --> 03:19.767
THERE'S A KIT IN THE DESK.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.570

03:22.603 --> 03:25.973
[groaning in pain]

03:26.006 --> 03:28.609

MM.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.414
THIS IS GONNA HURT LIKE HELL.

03:33.447 --> 03:36.484
- I WANT JUSTICE.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.419
OH, DAMN BLAST IT, BOHANNON!

03:38.452 --> 03:41.289
OH, GOD.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.558
[groaning in pain]

03:44.592 --> 03:46.294
- THE WORLD'S
CATCHING UP TO US

03:46.327 --> 03:49.297
IN THE FORM
OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.332
I'VE GONE UP AGAINST THEM
AND LOST IT ALL,

03:51.365 --> 03:52.566
JUST LIKE YOU'RE
ABOUT READY TO.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.435
- SHIT, THAT HURTS!

03:54.468 --> 03:56.304
OH!

03:56.337 --> 03:57.505
- WE'RE DONE HERE, DURANT.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.340
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW IT.

03:59.373 --> 04:03.444
- WE ONLY HAVE TO GET
THROUGH THAT MOUNTAIN.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.978
- OVER IT.

04:05.012 --> 04:09.317
AND I'M THE ONLY THAT CAN DO IT,
NOT YOU, NOT DELANEY--

04:09.317 --> 04:11.385
NOBODY BUT ME.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.787
AND IF I'M WRONG,
THEY CAN BURY US

04:13.821 --> 04:16.324
UNDERNEATH THAT ROCK PILE
OUT AT THE CUT,

04:16.357 --> 04:18.426
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHERE WE'RE HEADED ANYWAYS.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.561

04:23.564 --> 04:26.500
AAH!
[groaning in pain]

04:26.534 --> 04:29.570
- SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SURGEON
INSTEAD OF RAILROAD MAN.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.377
- "RAILROAD MAN"?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.346
- LOOKS LIKE IT.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.984
- WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME?

04:46.354 --> 04:48.856
- SIGN THAT.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.364
- THIS IS--THIS IS BLANK.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.399
- I MAY NEED IT.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.568
TRUST ME.

05:03.571 --> 05:06.574
THEY COME BACK,
THEY'RE COMING TO KILL YA.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.514
- NOT...

05:13.547 --> 05:16.417
IF I KILL THEM FIRST...

05:18.619 --> 05:20.388
ALL OF THEM.

05:20.388 --> 05:23.391
- BEST SET THEM
THOUGHTS ASIDE,

05:23.424 --> 05:27.395
OTHERWISE YOU'LL BRING
EVERYTHING DOWN ON OUR HEADS.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.664
- THERE ARE SOME MEN
WHO NEED KILLING.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.401
YOU AND I BOTH
KNOW THAT, BOHANNON.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.069
- UH...

05:36.103 --> 05:38.406
I'VE DRUNK FROM THAT CUP.

05:38.439 --> 05:41.409
IT DON'T QUENCH.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.445
OVER THE MOUNTAIN
AND OUT OF THIS PLACE...

05:44.478 --> 05:46.547
I'LL GET US THERE.

DON'T THEY, BOY?

06:31.459 --> 06:34.462
[Western folk music]

06:34.495 --> 06:42.135
*

07:02.623 --> 07:04.492
- THAT'S CALLED
A STEAM DREDGE.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.993
THEY'RE USING 'EM
TO DIG CANALS BACK EAST.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.995
NOW, THIS IS WHAT
ONE LOOKS LIKE.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.197
- FASCINATING, BUT I HAVE
NO USE FOR A STEAM DREDGE,

07:10.230 --> 07:11.799
MR. BOHANNON.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.201
- [chuckles]
NO. IT'S ME WHO DOES.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.869
I WASN'T TRYING
TO SELL YOU ONE.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.706
- AND WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SELL ME?

07:18.739 --> 07:22.209
- WELL, I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T LOAN
DURANT THE MONEY FOR THIS.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.044
- [chuckles]
HELL WOULD FREEZE FIRST.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.880
- SO I WAS HOPING YOU'D SEE
CLEAR TO LOAN US THE MONEY

07:26.914 --> 07:28.549
FOR A DOWN PAYMENT.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.983
- HMM.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.719
YOU HAVE COLLATERAL?
- NO, MA'AM.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.187
- STOP MAKING ME FEEL OLD.
- NO, MAGGIE, I DON'T.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.023
BUT THEY'RE STARTING
TO STOCKPILE BARBED WIRE

07:36.056 --> 07:37.991
IN CHICAGO.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.993
WE CAN SEND A LETTER
FORBIDDING UNION PACIFIC

07:40.027 --> 07:41.895
TO SHIP IT WEST.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.698
- THAT'S NOT COLLATERAL...

07:44.732 --> 07:46.867
BUT I WILL TAKE IT.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.136
- FILL IT OUT HOW YOU LIKE.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.005
WHAT ABOUT FOR THE LOAN?

07:52.039 --> 07:55.643
- ONLY FOR YOUR WIFE
AND SON WILL I DO IT.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.579
YOU NEED TO MOVE THEM
OUT OF HERE.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.848
- YOU'RE THE SECOND PERSON
TO TELL ME THAT TODAY.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.083
- OH.

08:03.116 --> 08:07.555
[door opens, closes]

08:07.555 --> 08:10.090
- [sniffs]

08:10.123 --> 08:12.626
[footsteps approaching]

08:17.297 --> 08:21.201
GOD, MAN,
WERE YOU KICKED BY A HORSE?

08:21.234 --> 08:23.704
- ONE OF YOUR MEN...

08:23.737 --> 08:27.207
I BELIEVE
HIS NAME IS HECKARD.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.279
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO PROVOKE HIM?

08:32.312 --> 08:35.282
- PROVOKE?

08:35.315 --> 08:37.618
HE BROKE INTO MY CAR,

08:37.651 --> 08:41.288
ACCUSED ME OF KILLING
HIS--HIS PARAMOUR,

08:41.321 --> 08:42.956
AND THEN HE TRIED TO KILL ME.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.892
- OH.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.661
YES, HE'S UPSET
AT JESSUP'S PASSING.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.899
THEY WERE VERY CLOSE.

08:55.302 --> 08:59.707
- I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH JESSUP'S KILLING.

08:59.740 --> 09:03.744
- AND I WILL ENJOY TAKING
YOUR RAILROAD FROM YOU,

09:03.777 --> 09:08.649
BUT KILLING YOU WOULD SPOIL
THE SPORT OF IT FOR ME.

09:08.682 --> 09:12.152
I DID NOT SEND HECKARD
TO YOUR CAR LAST NIGHT.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.987
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

09:18.025 --> 09:21.328
- I WANT JUSTICE.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.664
- IN THIS CASE, I UNDERSTAND.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.166
I'LL PUT HECKARD
ON THE FIRST TRAIN BACK EAST

09:26.199 --> 09:28.168
THIS AFTERNOON.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.337
- THIS AFTERNOON?

09:32.372 --> 09:34.675
I WANT MORE.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.811
- WELL, THAT'LL HAVE
TO SUFFICE.

09:37.845 --> 09:41.314
THE MAN IS GRIEVING.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.317
YOU'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE SURVIVED AT ALL.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.155
GOOD DAY.

09:54.294 --> 09:58.131
- [sighs]

09:58.165 --> 10:00.701
- I CAN'T TAKE
ANY MORE OF THIS, ABBY.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.336
GO OVER, CONFRONT DURANT,
BE DONE WITH IT.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.939
- I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH.
HE SCARES ME.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.709
- YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH,
OR IS IT CONVICTION?

10:10.377 --> 10:12.746
THERE IS DOUBT IN YOUR MIND.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.315
- MY OWN THINKING DISGUSTS ME.
WHAT IF I'M WRONG?

10:15.348 --> 10:17.317
- WE'LL NEVER KNOW, ABBY.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.286
THERE WAS NEVER A TRACE
OF YOUR FATHER.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.354
- THE DETECTIVE SEEMED SURE.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.057
- THE DETECTIVE
WAS HERE ONE DAY.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.959
GO HOME...

10:25.993 --> 10:29.663
GRIEVE WITH YOUR MOTHER,
FIND SOME COMFORT IN THAT.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.198
YOU'RE MISERABLE HERE.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.867
- AND I'M MAKING
YOU MISERABLE TOO.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.408
- I'LL WIRE YOU
IF I DISCOVER ANYTHING.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.412
- WRITE ME LETTERS...

10:45.445 --> 10:48.916
NOT TOO RUDE,
IN CASE MOTHER OPENS THEM.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.786
WHAT IS IT?

10:54.421 --> 10:56.423
- [sniffs] IT'S HARDER
FOR YOU TO LEAVE DURANT

10:56.456 --> 10:59.659
THAN IT IS TO LEAVE ME.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.030
BUT...GO.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.276
- I KNOW YOU PRAY FOR ME--

11:16.309 --> 11:19.412
F-FOR US, AND, UH, I THINK
YOUR PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.181
I JUST GOT THE MONEY
FOR A PIECE OF MACHINERY

11:21.214 --> 11:23.817
TO GET US OVER THAT MOUNTAIN
AND OUT OF THIS PLACE.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.452
FEW WEEKS, WE WON'T EVER HAVE
TO SEE CHEYENNE

11:25.485 --> 11:28.121
OR THE WYOMING TERRITORY AGAIN.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.890
- OR MY FAMILY?

11:29.923 --> 11:32.292
WILL I EVER SEE THEM AGAIN?

11:32.325 --> 11:33.861
- IF YOU REALLY
WANTED TO, YEAH.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.263
- I WOULD REALLY WANT TO.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.298
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.800
WE'LL TAKE THE TRAIN.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.969
BY THEN, I'LL HAVE
MY OWN PRIVATE CAR.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.904
- YOUR CAR?

11:43.937 --> 11:47.307
WILL THE BABY AND I BE THERE?

11:47.340 --> 11:50.143
- THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.112
- CULLEN!

12:09.129 --> 12:11.164
- ELAM.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.401
GOD ALMIGHTY, SON.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.269
ELAM...

12:16.303 --> 12:18.338
IT'S ME--CULLEN.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.007
CAN YOU SEE ME ALL RIGHT?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.509
- I SEE YOU IN MY PATH.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.815
- LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHING GOT AT YA.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.983
BEAR?

12:30.017 --> 12:32.820
- I AM BEAR KILLER.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.487
- YEAH.

12:34.521 --> 12:38.358
YEAH, I OWN THAT'S TRUE
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.428
SO THESE YOURS WIVES?

12:41.461 --> 12:44.364
HUH?

12:44.397 --> 12:47.034
HEY...

12:47.067 --> 12:48.368
I GOT ME A WIFE.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.203
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?

12:50.237 --> 12:51.504
A SON TOO.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.910
ELAM--
- WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

12:59.312 --> 13:00.513
YOU WANT TO BUY THESE SLAVE?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.115
- PLEASE HELP US.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.953
- YOU DON'T SPEAK
UNLESS YOU SPOKE TO.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.226
YOU WANT TO BUY 'EM?

13:13.260 --> 13:15.929
- ELAM...

13:15.963 --> 13:18.131
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S MESSED YOU UP,

13:18.165 --> 13:21.001
BUT DON'T GO RIDING
INTO CHEYENNE LIKE THIS.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.236
- I'M RIDING STRAIGHT IN.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.939
- YEAH, UH...

13:27.607 --> 13:30.310
YEAH, WE GOT
A, UH, AUCTION HOUSE.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.080
- SLAVE MARKET?

13:33.113 --> 13:35.382
- YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU CAMP
YOURSELVES RIGHT HERE?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.151
I'LL COME FETCH YOU
AND THE SLAVES

13:38.185 --> 13:40.087
WHEN THE MARKET OPENS.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.589
THAT SOUND ABOUT RIGHT?

13:49.529 --> 13:51.965
- MM-HMM.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.603
- ALL RIGHT.

14:13.921 --> 14:17.925
[train bell ringing]

14:17.925 --> 14:21.261
- THIS IS
A THIRD-CLASS TICKET, SIR.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.233
- [scoffs]

14:42.182 --> 14:46.086
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

14:46.119 --> 14:49.256
- I GOT YOU ON TWO PAIR.

14:49.289 --> 14:53.961
AND YOU, MY FRIEND,
ARE BLUFFING.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.030
[chuckles]

14:57.064 --> 14:58.631
I SEE YOUR DOLLAR.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.133
- COME ON.
THIS CAN'T WAIT.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.169
LEAVE THE POT.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.237
YOU'RE SAVING ME FROM A BUSTED
FLUSH, BUT I'LL LOSE MY SEAT!

15:04.271 --> 15:05.973
- ELAM'S BACK.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.110
- WAIT.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.412
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO HIM.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.314
I...

15:14.347 --> 15:17.250
SOMETHING BAD.
HE AIN'T RIGHT.

15:17.284 --> 15:21.254
- WELL, TAKE ME TO HIM.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.190
- NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME, EVA.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.025
HE'S RIGHT MESSED UP,
ESPECIALLY HIS MIND.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.593
- I DON'T CARE.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.028
- I SEEN SOMETHING LIKE IT
IN THE WAR.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.629
SOME WOUNDS YOU DON'T WANT
TO SURVIVE.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.031
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S ELAM!

15:31.064 --> 15:34.001
- I KNOW! I--

15:34.001 --> 15:36.103
WHAT I'M SAYING IS...

15:36.136 --> 15:38.071
WE GOT TO BE GENTLE,
ALL RIGHT?

15:38.105 --> 15:40.273
HIS--HIS--HIS REMEMBERING
IS WRONG.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.010
HE DON'T SEEM TO KNOW ME,
BUT HE MIGHT KNOW YOU.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.179
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S BACK.
- HE MAY NOT BE BACK.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.082
[train whistle blows]

15:53.386 --> 15:56.523
[woman coughing]

16:08.368 --> 16:10.303
- ABBY...

16:10.337 --> 16:12.305
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:12.339 --> 16:15.108
- I'M GOING HOME TO BOSTON.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.344
- THIS TRAIN DOESN'T GO
TO BOSTON.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.212
THIS IS A PRIVATE TRAIN.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.048
WE HAVE TO GET YOU OFF.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.550
- UNCLE THOMAS, PLEASE.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.058
I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

16:34.361 --> 16:38.198
WHY ARE PEOPLE SAYING
YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO

16:38.231 --> 16:41.068
WITH FATHER'S DISAPPEARANCE?

16:41.068 --> 16:42.402
- PEOPLE DON'T THINK THAT.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.738
- THEY EVEN SAY YOU KILLED HIM.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.212
- YES.

16:52.245 --> 16:56.216
I KILLED YOUR FATHER, ABBY.

16:56.249 --> 16:59.152
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO KNOW HOW AND WHY?

17:15.168 --> 17:17.570
- ELAM?

17:27.180 --> 17:29.549
ELAM...

17:29.582 --> 17:31.218
IT'S EVA.

17:31.251 --> 17:34.121
IT'S ME.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.261
YOU BEEN WITH THEM ARAPAHO?

17:50.703 --> 17:52.472
- WHO YOU BELONG TO?

17:54.774 --> 17:57.510
- WE USED TO BELONG
TO EACH OTHER.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.579
- CAN'T NO SLAVE OWN
NO SLAVE.

17:59.612 --> 18:03.516
GO FIND YOUR MASTER,
UNLESS YOU A RUNAWAY.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.352
CUT YOUR HEELS FOR THAT.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.854
- ELAM.

18:12.725 --> 18:16.329
- HOW COME
I WANT TO HURT YOU?

18:16.363 --> 18:19.299
- FOR SOMETHING
I DONE TO YOU.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.604
- I WANT YOU.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.208
AND I WANT TO HURT YOU BAD.

18:28.241 --> 18:31.178
- I DON'T BLAME YOU.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.679
- NOW, WHO OWN YOU, I SAY?

18:32.712 --> 18:34.347
- NOBODY.
- YOU'RE A LIAR!

18:34.381 --> 18:36.216
- WHOA, ELAM. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.318
- I'LL COME WITH YOU
IF YOU LET THEM WOMEN FREE!

18:38.351 --> 18:39.852
- EVA, THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.
- ELAM!

18:39.886 --> 18:42.555
- ELAM, LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.724
BUYING, TRADING, SELLING--

18:44.757 --> 18:47.494
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN,
ALL RIGHT?

18:47.527 --> 18:50.563
TIMES HAS CHANGED.
THEY WON'T LET IT.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.532
I WON'T LET IT NEITHER.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.234
- IT AIN'T UP TO YOU.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.407
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.908
GET UP! GET UP!

19:01.941 --> 19:06.313
COME ON! LET'S GO!
WE GOING TO MARKET!

19:06.346 --> 19:08.315
COME ON!

19:17.724 --> 19:19.692
- ON MY ADVICE,

19:19.726 --> 19:22.362
HE INVESTED
YOUR ESTATE'S TREASURY

19:22.395 --> 19:24.897
HEAVILY
IN UNION PACIFIC BONDS.

19:24.931 --> 19:28.568
WHEN WE HAD TO DEFAULT...

19:28.601 --> 19:31.371
HE BECAME DESPERATE.

19:31.404 --> 19:34.307
I TAKE THE BLAME.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.377
HE WAS PRONE TO DESPONDENCY,

19:37.410 --> 19:39.512
AS YOU KNOW, ABBY.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.781
HE CAME TO ME
BEGGING FOR HELP.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.284
I COULDN'T.

19:44.317 --> 19:48.255
THEN ONE NIGHT HE--
HE SIMPLY DISAPPEARED.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.292
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE WORST.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.926
- HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE?

19:53.960 --> 19:56.329
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ME
TO BELIEVE?

19:56.363 --> 19:57.964
- HE TRIED ONCE BEFORE,
YOU KNOW.

19:57.997 --> 20:00.600
ASK YOUR MOTHER, ABBY.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.236
BUT HE LIVES ON.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.737
HE SUSTAINS ME

20:04.771 --> 20:07.740
THROUGH MY OWN NIGHTS
OF THE BLACK DOG.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.812
- ARE YOU LYING TO ME,
UNCLE THOMAS?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.881
[coughing]

20:14.914 --> 20:16.716
- NO, ABBY.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.419
NO.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.289
DID I KILL YOUR FATHER
BY INCLUDING HIM

20:22.322 --> 20:23.923
IN MY RAILROAD DREAMS?

20:23.956 --> 20:26.559
WILL I REGRET THAT
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.928
ABSOLUTELY.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.364
AM I A MURDERER?

20:33.300 --> 20:35.602
OBVIOUSLY NOT.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.305
[train squeals, rumbles]

20:38.338 --> 20:40.440
[steam hissing]

20:40.473 --> 20:42.842
- IS THERE TROUBLE?

20:42.875 --> 20:47.280
- I'LL GO AND CHECK ON IT,
AND YOU STAY HERE.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.285
- WHAT I HEAR BID
FOR THESE SLAVES?

20:52.319 --> 20:53.986
HUH?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.655
IT'S A GOOD BREED.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.290
- CAN WE HANDLE
THE MERCHANDISE?

20:57.324 --> 20:58.925
[laughter]

20:58.958 --> 21:00.927
- THEY BREED GOOD.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.463
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR DRUNK ASS AND GO HOME,

21:03.496 --> 21:05.832
YOU BLACK MAN?
[crowd gasps]

21:05.865 --> 21:07.600
- SOMEBODY PUT A STOP TO THIS!

21:07.634 --> 21:10.337
- I NEED TO HEAR A BID.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.804
SOMEBODY GIVE ME A BID!

21:11.838 --> 21:13.039
- SHIT!

21:13.072 --> 21:14.641
WAIT RIGHT HERE.
- COME ON!

21:14.674 --> 21:17.477
THIS A GOOD BREED RIGHT HERE.
THEY MAKE GOOD BABIES.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.812
THEY WORK HARD.

21:19.846 --> 21:23.350
SUNUP TO SUNDOWN,
THEY WORK HARD.

21:23.350 --> 21:26.886
- ONCE YOU SEPARATE THE NEGRO
FROM HIS PRISONERS

21:26.919 --> 21:30.490
AND HE REFUSES TO SURRENDER,
KILL HIM.

21:30.523 --> 21:31.824
- WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

21:33.660 --> 21:36.663
- SEPARATE THE NEGRO
FROM THE WOMEN.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.998
IF HE SHOULD REFUSE,
THEN WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE, BUT--

21:39.031 --> 21:40.567
- NOW, HOLD ON.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.068
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.370
- NEVER HAND ME AGAIN.

21:45.705 --> 21:49.642
THERE WILL BE NO TRADE
IN HUMAN COMMERCE IN MY TOWN...

21:49.676 --> 21:52.812
NEITHER INVOLVING SQUAW,
WHITE WOMEN,

21:52.845 --> 21:54.481
NOR ADDLED NEGRO.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.915
- ALL RIGHT, NOW,
HE AIN'T DONE NOTHING.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.451
- CONTRARILY,
HE'S STATED HIS INTENT

21:58.485 --> 22:00.019
AT THE MOST HEINOUS OF CRIMES,

22:00.052 --> 22:02.422
AND HE IS GUILTY OF KIDNAPPING
AT THE LEAST.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.691
LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S A DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

22:04.724 --> 22:07.927
- [shouting indistinctly]

22:07.960 --> 22:10.763
- MR. CAMPBELL...

22:10.797 --> 22:13.065
YOU'RE A VETERAN.

22:13.099 --> 22:17.704
YOU KNOW WHAT VIOLENCE
CAN DO TO A MAN.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.106
- MAINLY TO THE WEAK-MINDED

22:20.139 --> 22:23.109
AND PREDISPOSED TO VIOLENCE.

22:23.142 --> 22:25.945
THE NEGRO IS AN INFERIOR RACE,

22:25.978 --> 22:28.615
BUT HUMAN NONETHELESS.

22:28.648 --> 22:33.119
THAT IS WHY WE FOUGHT YOUR WAR,
MR. BOHANNON.

22:33.152 --> 22:37.023
THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION,

22:37.056 --> 22:38.958
THE CONSTITUTION...

22:38.991 --> 22:41.027
THOSE ARE HIS RIGHTS.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.895
- HE AIN'T IN HIS MIND.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.432
HE'LL FIGHT YOU
IF HE'S CORNERED.

22:45.432 --> 22:48.067
- THEN THAT IS HIS CHOICE.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.504
FIELD THE PERIMETER
WHEN HE MAKES A RUN.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.976
- THAT MAN RIGHT THERE...

22:57.009 --> 22:59.512
THAT'S MY FRIEND.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.556
- OKAY.

23:09.589 --> 23:13.125
YOU HAVE 15 MINUTES
TO SOLVE THIS CHARADE.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.744
- HEY.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

23:31.778 --> 23:33.513
- YOUR STOP.

23:33.546 --> 23:36.749

23:36.783 --> 23:37.984
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:38.017 --> 23:40.152
GET YOUR--

23:40.186 --> 23:42.489
[grunts]

23:44.190 --> 23:46.192
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN!

23:46.225 --> 23:48.761
DO YOU--
YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

23:48.795 --> 23:50.096
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

23:50.129 --> 23:51.163
- I DO.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.199
- [grunts]

23:53.232 --> 23:55.502
- HOW DID MRS. DELANEY
GET ON THE TRAIN?

23:55.535 --> 23:56.636
- WE DIDN'T SEE HER,
MR. DURANT.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.772
- [whimpers]

23:59.806 --> 24:03.109
- STRAIGHT TO CHEYENNE
AFTER THIS.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.645
[both grunting]

24:43.583 --> 24:45.985
- LOOK AT HER.
SHE BREED GOOD FOR YOU!

24:46.018 --> 24:47.219
- GONE CRAZY.

24:47.253 --> 24:48.655

24:48.688 --> 24:53.593
SHE BREED GOOD

ELAM?

25:11.711 --> 25:14.914
CULLEN BOHANNON.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.583

25:16.583 --> 25:18.685

YEAH.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.721
[normal voice]
WE BEEN FRIENDS A LONG TIME.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.856

25:23.890 --> 25:26.959
THAT THERE ONE OF YOURS?

25:27.994 --> 25:30.763
- THIS AIN'T A SLAVE MARKET.

25:30.797 --> 25:34.734
THIS AIN'T CHARLESTON,
NEW ORLEANS NEITHER.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.936
THIS IS CHEYENNE.

25:36.969 --> 25:40.139
YOU EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

25:42.909 --> 25:45.011

I'M TRYING TO SAVE
YOUR DAMN LIFE.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.632
COME ON.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.767
Y'ALL GET ON HOME!

26:07.800 --> 26:09.769
THIS AIN'T A DAMN SHOW.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.070
Elam: PRIME, HEALTHY.
IT AIN'T GONNA COST YOU A LOT.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.139

Elam: COME HERE!

26:13.172 --> 26:14.941

- INTERESTING TO WATCH
MR. BOHANNON

26:23.349 --> 26:26.786
CONFRONT THE MONSTER
OF HIS OWN CREATION.

26:26.819 --> 26:27.920
- INTERESTING?
- MM-HMM.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.022
- THOSE WOMEN'S LIVES
ARE AT RISK.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.824
- I'M WELL AWARE.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.661
I'VE ORDERED MY MEN
NOT TO SPOOK THE NEGRO.

26:34.694 --> 26:40.667
- HIS NAME IS ELAM FERGUSON,
AN HONORABLE MAN.

26:40.667 --> 26:41.768
AT LEAST I'VE KNOWN HIM TO BE.
Elam: COME ON!

26:41.801 --> 26:44.671
GET YOUR HEAD UP!

26:44.671 --> 26:46.673

26:46.706 --> 26:48.307
YOU TRYING TO BE UPPITY
ON ME?

26:48.340 --> 26:49.876
YOU TRYING TO BE
AN UPPITY NEGRO?

26:49.909 --> 26:51.944
- NOTHING IN HIS PAST
WILL SAVE HIM

26:51.978 --> 26:55.748
FROM HIS FATE TODAY.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.717
- AND KILLING A NEGRO MAKES YOU
A LITTLE MORE FORMIDABLE,

26:57.750 --> 26:59.886
DOESN'T IT?

26:59.919 --> 27:02.955
Elam: THEY WORK HARD.

27:02.989 --> 27:06.025
- THOSE WOMEN'S LIVES
ARE AT RISK.

WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON THAT,
ARE WE NOT?

27:09.161 --> 27:13.032
Elam: I NEED TO HEAR A BID
FOR THESE SLAVES NOW.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.802
THEY'RE WORTH MORE THAN THAT.

27:15.835 --> 27:19.071
- JUST KEEP IN MIND, YOU'D BE
WALKING INTO FIVE DRAWN GUNS.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.339
- COME ON, NOW.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.141
DO I HEAR A BID
FOR THESE WOMEN?

27:22.174 --> 27:23.342
GET UP. LOOK AT ME.
- GOOD LORD.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.778

SHOW YOUR FACE.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.781
WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT DO YOU DO?
- ELAM!

27:30.717 --> 27:31.851

27:31.884 --> 27:33.820
[both laughing]

27:36.889 --> 27:38.858
- OH, I KNEW YOU'D KNOW ME.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.060
MM-HMM.
HEARD YOU WAS BACK, HUH?

27:41.093 --> 27:43.863
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- YOU TOO.

27:43.896 --> 27:47.399
YOU ABOUT FINISHED HERE?

27:47.433 --> 27:49.001

TO GET SOMETHING FOR ME.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.737
- ANYTHING.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.104
- RUN TO THE BIG HOUSE
AND TELL MAMMA

27:52.138 --> 27:53.806
TO GET ME SOMETHING
FOR MY HEAD.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.606
IT'S STARTING TO HURT.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.009
