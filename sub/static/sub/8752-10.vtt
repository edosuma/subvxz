WEBVTT

00:10.818 --> 00:13.826
Some guy is yelling, ha,
ha, ha, you [Bleep] coward.

00:13.827 --> 00:16.788
They told me if I knew what they
knew I would never buy the place.

00:16.789 --> 00:18.489
Very, very sad.

00:18.490 --> 00:20.927
When it happens it's
terrifying, actually.

00:20.928 --> 00:24.515
There was somebody who
killed themselves here.

00:24.516 --> 00:27.169
Shoots him in the back of
the head, kills him instantly.

00:27.170 --> 00:30.256
I love this building. I'll
never walk away from it.

00:30.257 --> 00:34.037
It's like a city of the dead.

00:34.386 --> 00:35.922
It's really bad in here.

00:35.923 --> 00:38.911
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.912 --> 00:40.867
Something is not right.

00:40.868 --> 00:42.176
I see dead people.

00:42.177 --> 00:44.192
This person might have
been a serial killer.

00:44.193 --> 00:45.954
I speak to dead people.

00:45.955 --> 00:47.490
You get those chills.

00:47.491 --> 00:49.058
And they speak to me.

00:49.059 --> 00:51.561
He is darkness. He is evil.

00:51.562 --> 00:54.664
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.665 --> 00:56.470
I think she broke her neck.

00:56.471 --> 00:57.657
I rely on my partner.

00:57.658 --> 01:02.050
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:02.051 --> 01:03.475
You telling me the truth?

01:03.476 --> 01:06.582
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.217
I think the Devil is down here.

01:08.218 --> 01:09.718
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.719 --> 01:11.458
Who the hell would do this?

01:11.459 --> 01:13.323
But Steve and I never speak...

01:13.324 --> 01:15.294
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.295 --> 01:16.889
Until the very end.

01:16.890 --> 01:18.031
Who's he looking to kill?

01:18.032 --> 01:20.138
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:20.139 --> 01:22.305
You need to get out of here right now.

01:22.306 --> 01:23.473
Or time to get out.

01:23.474 --> 01:27.074
It was like endless darkness.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074

01:43.471 --> 01:47.158
Amy and I conduct
separate investigations.

01:47.159 --> 01:53.059
I look into the history of the location,
digging up its secrets and forgotten past.

01:53.138 --> 01:56.918
While Amy speaks with the dead.

01:57.594 --> 02:00.479
I'm in the old Wild West,
Deadwood, South Dakota.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.770
We got called in by a guy named Ron.

02:02.771 --> 02:05.582
Now, Ron runs a bar and casino in town.

02:05.583 --> 02:09.577
And for the past 20 years, he's
been trying to restore the building.

02:09.578 --> 02:11.945
Only problem is, every
time he swings a hammer

02:11.946 --> 02:13.914
the paranormal activity gets dangerous.

02:13.915 --> 02:16.829
He says time is running
out and that Amy and I

02:16.830 --> 02:21.930
are his last chance to
have his dream come true.

02:26.859 --> 02:32.759
Before Amy arrives, I look for anything
that might influence her findings.

02:33.771 --> 02:36.730
This hotel casino has a lot
of photographs and historic

02:36.731 --> 02:41.535
information that has to
be covered or removed.

02:41.536 --> 02:47.436
When I'm finished, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

03:02.207 --> 03:07.182
There's more dead here than
the dead here would like.

03:07.183 --> 03:11.185
It's hard to keep all of them in line.

03:11.186 --> 03:14.666
There's five men here now.

03:15.016 --> 03:17.978
They're, like, a team
of bad men that are now

03:17.979 --> 03:21.191
trying to make up for their bad deeds.

03:21.192 --> 03:26.229
And I think their crimes
run from stealing to murder.

03:26.230 --> 03:29.030
You know, basically,
they're gonna escort me.

03:29.031 --> 03:34.611
The one guy says, like,
it's like a city of the dead.

03:43.308 --> 03:45.035
This place is amazing.

03:45.036 --> 03:46.814
It's a great place.

03:46.815 --> 03:50.116
When I walked in the door, I
fell in love with the place.

03:50.117 --> 03:54.187
I just knew that I needed to be
here, kind of like I was here before.

03:54.188 --> 03:58.346
And so, I want the place restored
just like it was in the past.

03:58.347 --> 04:00.251
Now, did you have any
ideas that there may be

04:00.252 --> 04:02.225
some stuff going on when
you went to go buy it?

04:02.226 --> 04:03.593
Yes, I did.

04:03.594 --> 04:05.920
When I talked to the previous owners...

04:05.921 --> 04:08.141
They told me if I knew
what they knew or saw

04:08.142 --> 04:10.082
what they had seen, I
would never buy the place.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.337
Now, let me ask you a question, before
you bought this place were you a skeptic?

04:13.338 --> 04:16.355
- Do you believe in paranormal?
- Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

04:16.356 --> 04:21.047
But, after I've been here,
what I've seen, I believe now.

04:21.048 --> 04:24.083
Can you give me, like, a broad idea
of all the stuff that's happening here?

04:24.084 --> 04:27.171
Well, we've had things thrown around.

04:27.172 --> 04:30.804
People hear noises, doors
are opening and closing.

04:30.805 --> 04:32.870
You know, people are
feeling that they're being

04:32.871 --> 04:35.450
touched and they get really frightened.

04:35.451 --> 04:36.623
That's a problem.

04:36.624 --> 04:38.850
Oh, yeah. I've had
customers run out the door.

04:38.851 --> 04:41.166
Do you know any history
about the building itself?

04:41.167 --> 04:45.502
It was a Brothel in the past and
there was illegal gambling here.

04:45.503 --> 04:47.504
Let me ask you a question,
how long are you here?

04:47.505 --> 04:50.374
- 23 years.
- So, why are you calling us now?

04:50.375 --> 04:53.176
The more work we do, the
more the activity picks up.

04:53.177 --> 04:55.430
Some of the investors get spooked off.

04:55.431 --> 04:58.273
And I love this place,
and it hurts me not to

04:58.274 --> 05:03.074
see the place of my
dreams come to fruition.

05:14.825 --> 05:18.905
The dead don't care for the decor.

05:22.138 --> 05:27.908
So, each dead person tries to keep it
the way it was when they were alive.

05:27.909 --> 05:30.398
- Mm.
- Because...

05:30.399 --> 05:35.139
It confuses them, and
that makes them upset.

05:35.658 --> 05:38.778
It does hurt my head.

05:44.617 --> 05:46.458
So, Ron, why'd you bring me up here?

05:46.459 --> 05:49.467
I brought you up here because this
is one of the creepiest places.

05:49.468 --> 05:50.342
What's the story?

05:50.343 --> 05:53.136
Activity picks up as soon as we
start doing construction here.

05:53.137 --> 05:55.761
So it's as if whatever's here
doesn't want you to make changes?

05:55.762 --> 05:57.453
Yeah, exactly.

05:57.454 --> 06:00.878
So now, have you ever experienced
anything yourself up here?

06:00.879 --> 06:03.514
Yeah. There's this gray-haired woman,

06:03.515 --> 06:06.926
and I don't know why, but she's
always laying on the floor.

06:06.927 --> 06:08.960
Can you see through her?

06:08.961 --> 06:10.968
No, like a solid apparition.

06:10.969 --> 06:14.938
Does she acknowledge or
look at you when you see her?

06:14.939 --> 06:16.471
Yeah, she looks at me.

06:16.472 --> 06:20.403
And then, when I see her, I just turn
around and head right the heck out.

06:20.404 --> 06:22.587
And you're sure this is
not some kind of maybe a

06:22.588 --> 06:24.729
reflection coming from
outside or anything like that?

06:24.730 --> 06:27.677
I've seen it too many times and
it's always in the same place.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.497
How do you deal with this?

06:29.498 --> 06:31.566
- Well, you got to deal with it.
- Right.

06:31.567 --> 06:34.298
And so, every time I enter
a space that I haven't

06:34.299 --> 06:37.028
been in for a while,
I'll say, coming in!

06:37.029 --> 06:38.430
I feel more comfortable.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.649
Okay, is there anything else?

06:39.650 --> 06:42.860
I've seen a guy that's
clothed in dark clothing,

06:42.861 --> 06:45.083
like a long rider coat, late at night.

06:45.084 --> 06:46.430
- Okay.
- Dark hat.

06:46.431 --> 06:48.741
And moves from the ladies' room area,

06:48.742 --> 06:51.580
and then kind of vanishes
towards the back of the room.

06:51.581 --> 06:52.914
Has anybody else seen it?

06:52.915 --> 06:58.815
Yeah, most of my employees have
seen him, some customers, as well.

07:02.124 --> 07:05.107
The dead Cowboy dudes, one's saying

07:05.108 --> 07:09.747
a lot of good times over
here, drinking and gambling.

07:09.748 --> 07:14.548
One of them says that
something bad happened.

07:14.816 --> 07:16.761
They're not really letting me get it.

07:16.762 --> 07:19.108
They're blocking it.

07:19.109 --> 07:23.549
And I feel, like, an impact in my head.

07:25.641 --> 07:27.611
I feel like it's male.

07:27.612 --> 07:33.512
Either they got shot in the head
or they shot themselves in the head.

07:38.900 --> 07:40.769
I lived here for five years.

07:40.770 --> 07:44.242
- Was this your bedroom?
- Yeah, I moved out in '95.

07:44.243 --> 07:45.595
Okay, so what happened?

07:45.596 --> 07:51.496
Well, I was laying down over here,
sleeping, and I was laying like this.

07:51.615 --> 07:54.872
And all of a sudden, I just went
up like this and, what the...

07:54.873 --> 07:58.451
And I seen... right where you're
standing is where I saw this tall woman.

07:58.452 --> 08:00.610
She was in a green dress with red hair.

08:00.611 --> 08:04.918
And I couldn't move, and she just
stood there about four or five minutes.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.479
And I just couldn't move.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.986
Are you on any kind of medication
when you go to bed at night?

08:08.987 --> 08:10.020
No.

08:10.021 --> 08:11.696
That must have scared
the hell out of you.

08:11.697 --> 08:13.917
Yeah, I moved out that next month.

08:13.918 --> 08:15.744
Now, would you stay
overnight alone again?

08:15.745 --> 08:17.362
No. No.

08:17.363 --> 08:20.997
So now, is there anything else you
can tell me that might help my case?

08:20.998 --> 08:23.137
Many people have had to stay here.

08:23.138 --> 08:27.112
They've had the sensation of their
hand being moved off their chest.

08:27.113 --> 08:29.577
Or away from their side
while they are sleeping.

08:29.578 --> 08:32.909
And it had been a very
frightening experience to them.

08:32.909 --> 08:36.520
If we don't get this paranormal problem
fixed, I might never get any investors.

08:36.522 --> 08:38.414
I might never get the place fixed.

08:38.414 --> 08:41.073
If my partner told you things
are gonna get worse here, or

08:41.073 --> 08:43.758
you really shouldn't stay
here, how would you take that?

08:43.759 --> 08:45.261
Well, I love this building.

08:45.262 --> 08:48.982
I'll never walk away from it.

08:50.539 --> 08:53.359
There's a male...

08:53.360 --> 08:54.860
Who is not a happy camper.

08:54.861 --> 08:58.341
Who is not a happy camper.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.620
At all.

09:02.502 --> 09:07.602
Mm-mm. This grumpy guy,
he stays up here a lot.

09:08.242 --> 09:13.449
I feel like up here is, like,
off-limits for living people.

09:13.450 --> 09:16.390
And he gets pissed.

09:20.724 --> 09:23.627
Makes him feel angry.

09:23.628 --> 09:25.992
Do you know if he does
anything to the living?

09:25.993 --> 09:30.301
I know he is working on
trying to physically harm them.

09:30.302 --> 09:32.622
He's trying to...

09:32.623 --> 09:35.623
Scare them to death.

09:57.069 --> 10:00.072
Kathleen, I talked to Ron, and he
was telling me that you work here.

10:00.073 --> 10:02.518
But he also said that you
actually lived here at some point.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.228
Yes, I was here for a week.

10:04.229 --> 10:08.978
And I am the only person on staff
who will come up into the 2nd floor.

10:08.979 --> 10:10.828
So, none of the other
staff will come up here?

10:10.829 --> 10:12.604
No, they send me.

10:12.605 --> 10:15.596
- Have you had experiences here?
- I've had my hair stroked.

10:15.597 --> 10:20.445
I've had a hand on my forehead, and
I've had a hand on my lower back.

10:20.446 --> 10:22.523
Can you tell if it was a
man's hand or a woman's?

10:22.524 --> 10:26.617
It seemed to be as if a man was
escorting a lady out for the evening.

10:26.618 --> 10:29.444
When it happens it's
terrifying, actually.

10:29.445 --> 10:31.479
The hair stands up on
the back of your neck.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.614
You feel an electrical
crackling and you shake.

10:33.615 --> 10:36.686
Okay, so is there anything
else you've experienced up here?

10:36.687 --> 10:40.348
I woke up around 3:20 in the morning.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.557
I heard footsteps outside.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.275
I heard voices.

10:44.276 --> 10:49.677
I opened my eyes, and there was a woman
at the foot of my bed wearing a blue dress.

10:49.678 --> 10:51.900
I think her hair was red.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.570
- And she was just looking at me.
- Somebody broke in maybe?

10:54.571 --> 10:57.358
The alarm would have gone off and
the police would have been here.

10:57.359 --> 11:01.202
I was scared enough to not only bolt
the door, but to pull the heaviest

11:01.203 --> 11:06.615
piece of furniture from the room
and put it in front of the door.

11:06.616 --> 11:11.416
There's a woman, and
she was always talking.

11:11.851 --> 11:14.958
You can still hear her, you
know, going on and on and on.

11:14.959 --> 11:19.195
People, if they don't see her,
that would [Bleep] shock me.

11:19.196 --> 11:20.764
She worked here.

11:20.765 --> 11:23.568
She was a busybody, who...

11:23.569 --> 11:26.269
Was here a lot.

11:28.738 --> 11:32.609
- She just always complains.
- What did she do here?

11:32.610 --> 11:35.540
I think she did sleep with people.

11:35.541 --> 11:38.447
The other dead people
don't appreciate her.

11:38.448 --> 11:42.218
So, they'll, like, try
to keep her in a room.

11:42.219 --> 11:46.956
So you might hear her yelling or
screaming to get out, or banging on doors.

11:46.957 --> 11:51.097
And doors closing on their own, yes.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.046
So, do you have experiences
down here, as well?

11:57.047 --> 11:58.601
- Yes.
- Okay, like what?

11:58.602 --> 12:00.069
Our gaming tokens, for instance.

12:00.070 --> 12:03.473
They're kept far back from the edge of
the counter, so that they don't fall over.

12:03.474 --> 12:07.099
And every now and again, you'll
just see one come up from the tray,

12:07.100 --> 12:09.955
flip over and land on the floor.

12:09.956 --> 12:13.801
- And you actually see it in the air?
- Yes.

12:13.802 --> 12:16.718
I'm trying to figure out how that
can be explained, and I can't.

12:16.719 --> 12:18.566
Is that the only thing
you've seen down here?

12:18.567 --> 12:22.071
There's an old lady who
wears a long, white nightgown,

12:22.072 --> 12:25.430
she walks up and down the hallway.

12:25.431 --> 12:28.339
And then stops and just
sort of watches you.

12:28.340 --> 12:30.226
Then she kind of dissolves.

12:30.227 --> 12:33.170
Kathleen, how would Ron take
it if my partner told him...

12:33.171 --> 12:35.428
Listen you got to get out
here, it's basically unsavable,

12:35.429 --> 12:37.563
you have to sell it
and count your losses?

12:37.564 --> 12:40.798
He's not going to give up. We
fight back for what we want.

12:40.799 --> 12:43.079
All right.

12:44.802 --> 12:50.082
There's an older woman
who putz around a lot here.

12:51.251 --> 12:55.646
I'm hearing 65, but she
looks a bit older than that.

12:55.647 --> 12:57.620
She is really tiny.

12:57.621 --> 12:59.697
She is probably only, like, five foot.

12:59.698 --> 13:01.698
On the heavier side.

13:01.699 --> 13:04.822
She wears a full dress.

13:04.823 --> 13:08.723
She definitely worked a lot here.

13:09.104 --> 13:12.584
And she didn't care for...

13:12.642 --> 13:17.005
The people that she worked
with or that worked for her.

13:17.006 --> 13:21.866
She really didn't care
what happened to them.

13:25.529 --> 13:27.930
- Richard I understand that you work here.
- Yes.

13:27.931 --> 13:29.885
Okay. Now, how long have
you been working here?

13:29.886 --> 13:32.432
Off and on for 20 years
or a little better.

13:32.433 --> 13:34.034
What do you do exactly?

13:34.035 --> 13:38.738
Well, I do a lot of maintenance work around
the place and I've also worked in the bar.

13:38.739 --> 13:40.807
A little bit of
everything in this place.

13:40.808 --> 13:43.656
It seems like everybody is having
experiences here. How about yourself?

13:43.657 --> 13:46.444
Yes, I've definitely had
some experiences here.

13:46.445 --> 13:48.615
Okay, tell me about some of them.

13:48.616 --> 13:52.322
Well, one of them when I was working
floor and the cage in the bar.

13:52.323 --> 13:55.534
- And I heard a door start creaking.
- Okay.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.671
And I turn around and look at the
door, and the door is opening up,

13:58.672 --> 14:04.092
and it opened wide like someone walked into
the place, and then gently went shut again.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.833
Nobody was visible anywhere.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.520
Have you seen anything else?

14:08.521 --> 14:12.884
Yeah, at sometime later I was
back here stocking beer cases.

14:12.885 --> 14:17.921
I had locked up, it's 3:00 in the
morning, there's no one in here but me.

14:17.922 --> 14:22.215
And somebody walks by and then
disappears right out through the wall.

14:22.216 --> 14:24.351
So, what exactly did it look like?

14:24.352 --> 14:27.049
A black coat with tails on it.

14:27.050 --> 14:29.037
Now, did you believe in this stuff?

14:29.038 --> 14:34.938
I never did till then, but it sure
convinced me at that time, it was all done.

14:38.365 --> 14:42.135
There's so many dead people here that
it is making my walk very disorienting.

14:42.136 --> 14:44.819
Everyone's trying to talk to me at once.

14:44.820 --> 14:49.980
But one guy by the bar
is demanding my attention.

14:50.510 --> 14:53.746
There's a man. He likes to work here.

14:53.747 --> 14:56.462
He feels very attached to the place.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.152
So, he gets mad because
they're not doing it right.

14:59.153 --> 15:02.033
And he wants to...

15:02.490 --> 15:04.910
Help, but they're not listening.

15:04.911 --> 15:08.393
So what will he do if
they're not listening?

15:08.394 --> 15:11.334
Go and hurt people.

15:24.153 --> 15:27.290
Ron told me his property
was built as a Brothel.

15:27.291 --> 15:31.306
From what I know about Deadwood, it was a
mining town, so I'm not surprised by that.

15:31.307 --> 15:34.914
But, when I reached out to a local
author, he told me there were two deaths at

15:34.915 --> 15:40.815
the property I'm investigating, directly
related to the prostitution business.

15:45.418 --> 15:48.802
So, you mentioned on the phone there
were two deaths that would help my case.

15:48.803 --> 15:52.572
But, before we get to that, I have got to
ask you a question about prostitution here.

15:52.573 --> 15:54.050
Was it pretty prevalent?

15:54.051 --> 15:58.009
During the initial influx of
the population in Deadwood...

15:58.010 --> 16:00.449
There were thousands of men.

16:00.450 --> 16:03.793
And they were here for one
thing, that's to pan gold.

16:03.794 --> 16:06.908
- Right.
- You're looking at something like this.

16:06.909 --> 16:09.829
So this is what it looked like
back in, I guess, the late 1800s?

16:09.830 --> 16:11.690
Yes.

16:13.359 --> 16:16.540
The ratio of men to
women was about 50 to 1.

16:16.541 --> 16:20.687
And everybody was looking for a good time
when they came in from the mining fields.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.676
So they'd dance with the girls
and maybe they'd get lucky.

16:23.677 --> 16:26.589
Okay, so how were these girls treated?

16:26.590 --> 16:31.526
Well, there some of them down there that
would beat the crap out of the girls.

16:31.527 --> 16:32.694
Is that right?

16:32.695 --> 16:35.419
One person in particular
that I researched

16:35.420 --> 16:38.373
beat the living daylights
out of one of his girls.

16:38.374 --> 16:40.957
He went to court and was fined $5.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.205
Really?

16:42.206 --> 16:45.498
As a matter of a fact, the
closer you got to the badlands,

16:45.499 --> 16:47.575
the worse conditions got for the girls.

16:47.576 --> 16:49.953
Okay, so the guys could act
however the hell they wanted?

16:49.954 --> 16:55.234
Pretty much, as long as
they didn't kill the girl.

17:00.522 --> 17:03.762
That's kind of strange.

17:03.934 --> 17:05.140
What?

17:05.141 --> 17:09.281
They might have had some sex slaves.

17:10.606 --> 17:15.494
I think that they died down
here, a lot of the ladies.

17:15.496 --> 17:17.955
It was cold.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.141
Um...

17:20.142 --> 17:24.289
They would not eat
and they're all naked.

17:24.290 --> 17:27.526
And they put them in here.

17:27.527 --> 17:30.717
Do you know who is putting them here?

17:30.718 --> 17:32.578
Men?

17:33.636 --> 17:35.537
Now, Joey, you mentioned
on the phone there were

17:35.538 --> 17:38.362
two deaths associated
with the Fairmont itself.

17:38.363 --> 17:41.129
- Related to prostitution?
- Yes.

17:41.130 --> 17:46.685
It was in 1907, and, Vinegar Rowan,
a sheep herder from Montana...

17:46.686 --> 17:50.675
Had a girlfriend that he
was very much attached to

17:50.676 --> 17:52.914
who worked as a
prostitute in the Fairmont.

17:52.915 --> 17:53.969
Okay.

17:53.970 --> 17:56.862
And he came in one day to see her.

17:56.863 --> 18:02.554
And when he entered the room, he found
out that she was with another man.

18:02.555 --> 18:06.615
So, he pulls out his gun and
immediately shoots that poor bastard.

18:06.616 --> 18:07.971
Does he kill him?

18:07.972 --> 18:10.558
- Actually, he'll survive.
- Okay.

18:10.559 --> 18:15.503
And then he took a couple of shots at
his girlfriend, and he missed entirely.

18:15.504 --> 18:18.578
So, she leaps out of
bed and grabs him by the

18:18.579 --> 18:21.870
shirt and tries to
force him out the door.

18:21.871 --> 18:26.942
He reaches around with his
gun and is trying to shoot her.

18:26.943 --> 18:28.161
Boom, boom, boom.

18:28.162 --> 18:31.478
And shoots himself in the [Bleep] head.

18:31.479 --> 18:33.683
He's dead.

18:33.684 --> 18:35.649
I've seen a lot of
things in my career but,

18:35.650 --> 18:37.987
this is one of the funniest
stories I've ever heard.

18:37.988 --> 18:41.213
- So, what was the other death, Jerry?
- Maggie Broadwater.

18:41.214 --> 18:45.108
She had been visiting
a boyfriend in Wyoming...

18:45.109 --> 18:47.723
And they had had a bad parting.

18:47.724 --> 18:50.933
And she came back and
started drinking quite a bit.

18:50.934 --> 18:53.619
It wasn't long before she
decided she was going to

18:53.620 --> 18:56.816
jump out of the third floor
window and kill herself.

18:56.817 --> 18:59.092
Here's newspaper clipping.

18:59.093 --> 19:01.164
So, this happened in the
Fairmont, she jumped out...

19:01.165 --> 19:04.374
She jumped out of the Fairmont.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.923
It says here, jumps
three stories and lives.

19:06.924 --> 19:09.925
The ground was so muddy in
the road where she jumped...

19:09.926 --> 19:12.098
She actually stuck in the mud.

19:12.099 --> 19:14.830
And they extracted her from the
mud and took her to the hospital...

19:14.831 --> 19:15.691
Okay.

19:15.692 --> 19:18.892
Where she lingered on for about
36 hours, maybe a little longer.

19:18.893 --> 19:20.997
They thought she was gonna survive.

19:20.998 --> 19:24.524
But it turned out that she
was dying of internal injuries.

19:24.525 --> 19:26.610
Really? All over some guy?

19:26.611 --> 19:29.191
- Yes.
- Okay.

19:40.469 --> 19:46.369
I definitely feel like there was
somebody who killed themselves here.

19:46.882 --> 19:49.102
A female.

19:52.177 --> 19:54.834
And she did it...

19:54.835 --> 19:56.881
Very dramatically.

19:56.882 --> 19:59.762
She was hysterical.

20:00.159 --> 20:03.279
Something bad happened.

20:03.422 --> 20:06.122
She was so sad.

20:07.511 --> 20:11.051
Like she maybe lost someone.

20:12.322 --> 20:14.666
It was really bad.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.307
Very, very sad.

20:30.387 --> 20:32.152
Look, this is Deadwood, South Dakota.

20:32.153 --> 20:34.717
And back in the day,
it was a violent town.

20:34.718 --> 20:37.135
Now, I know there had
to be more murders on my

20:37.136 --> 20:39.697
property that had nothing
to do with prostitution.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.632
So, I reached out to
a local Police Chief.

20:41.633 --> 20:43.853
He looked into it for me,
and he said there's a couple

20:43.854 --> 20:48.894
more homicides that will
definitely help my case.

20:54.478 --> 20:59.754
Chief, I know Deadwood, in my mind,
is the epitome of the wild, Wild West.

20:59.755 --> 21:00.900
How bad was it?

21:00.901 --> 21:06.545
You know, this is an area that was full
of brothels, full of card rooms, saloons.

21:06.546 --> 21:08.922
So, you might have
shooting in the streets.

21:08.923 --> 21:12.156
You might have violence
occurring in the saloons.

21:12.157 --> 21:13.785
So, it was a cop's nightmare.

21:13.786 --> 21:15.728
- Oh, absolutely.
- Okay.

21:15.729 --> 21:19.312
On the phone you said there were a couple
murders on the property I am investigating.

21:19.313 --> 21:21.533
Yeah, actually there
was two tragic deaths.

21:21.534 --> 21:25.185
Back then, the property you're
investigating was known as the Melodeon.

21:25.186 --> 21:28.685
Back in November 16th, 1876...

21:28.686 --> 21:32.813
They had a man by the name of Banjo
Dick Brown who was up on stage playing.

21:32.814 --> 21:33.678
Okay.

21:33.679 --> 21:36.402
A man in the audience stood
up and started to shout.

21:36.403 --> 21:41.692
And in the midst of the shouting
he throws an ax on stage.

21:41.693 --> 21:44.611
And Banjo Dick, without missing a beat,

21:44.612 --> 21:47.791
pulls his gun in a crowded
room and shot him dead.

21:47.792 --> 21:49.417
You're kidding me.

21:49.418 --> 21:51.483
So what was the second
death you were talking about?

21:51.484 --> 21:54.544
In July 23rd, 1949...

21:54.908 --> 21:58.394
Deadwood's Police
Chief, Nestor Erickson...

21:58.395 --> 22:04.227
Shot one of his ex-officers on Main
Street in front of the property.

22:04.228 --> 22:06.435
The ex-officer's name was John Gorham.

22:06.436 --> 22:10.231
He had worked at the Deadwood
Police Department for a few years

22:10.232 --> 22:14.613
before being fired for drinking
while in uniform, and also...

22:14.614 --> 22:18.568
He wrongfully beat
somebody while on the job.

22:18.569 --> 22:22.069
John Gorham was a very tough individual.

22:22.070 --> 22:26.231
He's actually a
middleweight boxing champion.

22:26.232 --> 22:28.320
Okay, so how does the shooting go down?

22:28.321 --> 22:31.267
He had been going on a drunken rampage.

22:31.268 --> 22:36.196
Chief shows up on Main Street and
advised Gorham that he was under arrest.

22:36.197 --> 22:40.262
Gorham approached Chief
Erickson with his fists clenched.

22:40.263 --> 22:42.341
- It was like he was gonna assault him.
- Okay.

22:42.342 --> 22:47.467
Chief Erickson then pulled his
duty weapon, and failing to stop,

22:47.468 --> 22:50.716
the Chief shot him once through
the heart in front of the property.

22:50.717 --> 22:54.551
It is said though, that after
being shot that he did advance

22:54.552 --> 23:00.452
four to five more steps towards Chief
Erickson while flailing his arms.

23:03.761 --> 23:08.814
Some guy is yelling, ha,
ha, ha, you [Bleep] coward.

23:08.815 --> 23:11.668
I feel like I'm staggering.

23:11.669 --> 23:15.207
Like I'm trying to get someone.

23:15.208 --> 23:19.168
I'm feeling pain... pressure here.

23:21.653 --> 23:24.293
I'm staggering.

23:24.632 --> 23:27.262
I'm angry, very angry.

23:27.263 --> 23:29.043
I don't know if it's
a heart attack or what,

23:29.044 --> 23:33.424
but it [Bleep] hurts really [Bleep] bad.

23:35.128 --> 23:38.352
With so many deaths tied to
the property I'm investigating,

23:38.353 --> 23:40.567
I need to see if anything
else went down there.

23:40.568 --> 23:44.286
So, I hit the books
at the local library.

23:44.287 --> 23:50.045
Searching through old records, I came
across an article about Wild Bill Hickok.

23:50.046 --> 23:54.299
Turns out he was murdered right
next door to the Fairmont Hotel.

23:54.300 --> 23:58.054
So, I'm heading over to the cemetery where
Wild Bill is buried to meet a historian.

23:58.055 --> 24:03.215
He is gonna tell me exactly
what happened to him.

24:05.720 --> 24:09.909
Kevin, through my research, I've found
out this Wild Bill Hickok got murdered,

24:09.910 --> 24:12.589
literally, right next door to the
property that I'm investigating.

24:12.590 --> 24:16.740
I know the name, it's famous, but I
really don't know anything about this guy.

24:16.741 --> 24:19.133
- What about him?
- Here's a picture of him.

24:19.134 --> 24:21.252
He died at age 39.

24:21.253 --> 24:23.971
This is where he is buried,
at Mount Moriah Cemetery.

24:23.972 --> 24:26.295
He was famous for being a lawman...

24:26.296 --> 24:28.750
Settling some of the
Wild West communities,

24:28.751 --> 24:32.027
and some shootouts in Missouri, as well.

24:32.028 --> 24:33.514
So he was quick with the gun.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.123
So, why does he come here?

24:35.124 --> 24:38.367
He comes here to prospect and to mine,

24:38.368 --> 24:41.056
but he also loved the
game of cards and gambling.

24:41.057 --> 24:44.357
While he's here, I guess something happens
and he winds up getting murdered, right?

24:44.358 --> 24:45.549
That's right.

24:45.550 --> 24:49.597
Wild Bill comes into the Nuttal & Mann's
Saloon right next door to the Fairmont.

24:49.598 --> 24:51.899
Sits down with his back to the door.

24:51.900 --> 24:55.288
- Okay.
- Unusual for Wild Bill.

24:55.289 --> 24:58.178
And then, a 25-year-old
named Jack McCall

24:58.179 --> 25:01.115
comes in and shoots him
in the back of the head.

25:01.116 --> 25:03.450
Kills him instantly, runs out the door.

25:03.451 --> 25:04.500
Okay.

25:04.501 --> 25:09.438
Here's the one photo that is considered
to be the photo of Jack McCall.

25:09.439 --> 25:12.306
You said he was 25. This guy
looks like he'd be in his 40s.

25:12.307 --> 25:15.399
In my opinion, there is no
known photo of Jack McCall.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.123
- Does he get caught?
- Yeah.

25:17.124 --> 25:23.024
He was taken, tried, convicted and found
guilty of murder, and sentenced to hang.

25:23.170 --> 25:25.911
Four years later, they
moved the cemetery.

25:25.912 --> 25:29.042
And when they moved the
cemetery, they open the casket,

25:29.043 --> 25:34.203
and the noose is still
around Jack McCall's neck.

25:34.575 --> 25:38.585
I'm seeing another guy that was hung.

25:38.586 --> 25:42.537
He admitted that he is not a good man.

25:42.538 --> 25:45.780
And I think it was an improper hanging.

25:45.781 --> 25:49.469
Just from the pain that I've
been experiencing from him,

25:49.470 --> 25:53.861
it was not done well and it
was excruciatingly painful.

25:53.862 --> 25:56.784
- You know when he's from?
- 18...

25:56.785 --> 25:59.125
80s, 1890s.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.947
- Age?
- 24, but he does look older.

26:02.948 --> 26:06.128
It really hurts a lot.

26:17.051 --> 26:19.019
I saw several dead people on my walk.

26:19.020 --> 26:23.799
But, the women being mistreated
in the basement stood out the most.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.526
They were all nude.

26:25.527 --> 26:26.811
How many?

26:26.812 --> 26:29.096
About five.

26:29.097 --> 26:34.708
Super skinny, some of them
looked really sickly and weak.

26:34.709 --> 26:37.026
These women were...

26:37.027 --> 26:39.487
Being abused.

26:41.972 --> 26:43.832
Amy?

26:45.468 --> 26:48.828
Yeah, that's what I saw.

27:10.962 --> 27:14.201
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations...

27:14.202 --> 27:18.936
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.670
Amy, I would like you to meet
Ron. Now, Ron owns this building.

27:21.671 --> 27:25.673
And his dream is to turn this
historic place into a thriving hotel.

27:25.674 --> 27:29.844
Problem is, every time he does some
construction, the activity here goes wild.

27:29.845 --> 27:32.013
He's worried about his
guests and his employees.

27:32.014 --> 27:34.434
Now, Kathleen here is
one of his employees.

27:34.435 --> 27:35.993
She works downstairs at the bar.

27:35.994 --> 27:38.926
She has had some very
frightening experiences.

27:38.927 --> 27:42.123
And she's worried that Ron's not ever
gonna be able to fulfill his dream.

27:42.124 --> 27:48.024
So, with that, I'm gonna ask
Amy to tell us about her walk.

27:49.764 --> 27:54.431
When I first got here,
there were these five men who

27:54.432 --> 27:57.771
came up to me in my opening
and they kind of surrounded me.

27:57.772 --> 28:01.341
They were my escorts
throughout the entire walk.

28:01.342 --> 28:04.683
But all of them had been bad people.

28:04.684 --> 28:08.824
And it went from thievery to murder.

28:10.155 --> 28:12.652
What they are doing...

28:12.653 --> 28:16.622
Here is they are actually
trying to protect people.

28:16.623 --> 28:20.990
This is how they feel they're
going to make up for...

28:20.991 --> 28:25.911
The things that they
did when they were alive.

28:26.226 --> 28:30.122
One of them brought up the fact
that this is the city of the dead.

28:30.123 --> 28:32.786
So, the individual that I worked with

28:32.787 --> 28:36.642
and spoke with the most
was this younger male.

28:36.643 --> 28:40.270
To me he looked like he'd
be in his early to mid 30s,

28:40.271 --> 28:44.337
but he claimed to be much
younger, like in his early 20s.

28:44.338 --> 28:46.979
I had a hard time
believing him about his age.

28:46.980 --> 28:51.042
And he was hanged for whatever he did.

28:51.043 --> 28:55.799
Um... and unfortunately,
his hanging did not go well.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.329
A couple things you mentioned
reminded me of the most

28:58.330 --> 29:00.453
famous murder that actually
took place in this town.

29:00.454 --> 29:05.137
And it took place literally right next
door to the building here, in a saloon.

29:05.138 --> 29:10.209
Wild Bill Hickok, who was a
famous lawman, gunslinger...

29:10.210 --> 29:12.444
Actually, here's a picture of him.

29:12.445 --> 29:13.891
This is Wild Bill Hickok.

29:13.892 --> 29:17.192
He was in the saloon but he wound
up having his back to the door.

29:17.193 --> 29:20.722
A young kid by the name of
Jack McCall, about 25, comes in.

29:20.723 --> 29:23.440
He says, take that, and he puts
one in the back of his head.

29:23.441 --> 29:24.628
Kills him instantly.

29:24.629 --> 29:28.960
He's caught, trial, found
guilty and he's hung.

29:28.961 --> 29:31.662
Now, you mentioned that
there was a bad hanging right?

29:31.663 --> 29:34.965
The cemetery he is buried in, they
decided four years later to move.

29:34.966 --> 29:37.562
So, they took all the bodies
and caskets and they moved them.

29:37.563 --> 29:39.909
When they opened up his casket...

29:39.910 --> 29:42.240
Apparently the hanging must've
went pretty rough and bad...

29:42.241 --> 29:45.317
The noose was still on his neck.

29:45.318 --> 29:48.971
This is a photo of who they
think may be Jack McCall.

29:48.972 --> 29:52.259
The kid is supposed to be 25,
this guy looks much older than 25.

29:52.260 --> 29:54.803
Oh, my God. Oh, he was 25?

29:54.804 --> 29:57.786
Right, but then you said he looked
a lot older than what he was.

29:57.787 --> 29:59.691
Well, yeah he did.

29:59.692 --> 30:01.299
Could he have been
this guy, Jack McCall?

30:01.300 --> 30:04.720
That's what I'm thinking.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.402
So, what else happened on your walk?

30:10.403 --> 30:13.021
When I was standing in
front of the restaurant...

30:13.022 --> 30:17.582
I felt and heard
another violent incident.

30:18.771 --> 30:23.411
One man was yelling, like,
ha, ha, you [Bleep] coward.

30:23.412 --> 30:26.518
And I felt like I was
staggering. And I felt anger.

30:26.519 --> 30:28.821
- Now, you said the guy was staggering?
- Yes.

30:28.822 --> 30:33.492
There actually was a man gunned down in
1949 right in front of the building here.

30:33.493 --> 30:36.195
There was a guy by the
name of Johnny Gorham.

30:36.196 --> 30:39.136
Now, Johnny was a middleweight champion.

30:39.137 --> 30:41.762
- A boxer.
- Oh, my God.

30:41.763 --> 30:43.702
There's a picture of him here.

30:43.703 --> 30:47.273
He was also a Police
Officer in Deadwood.

30:47.274 --> 30:49.194
What?

30:49.858 --> 30:53.149
One night, he got drunk...

30:53.150 --> 30:56.080
Went to a few bars, he
was punching people out.

30:56.081 --> 30:59.905
They call the Police Chief to help
arrest him, who actually fired him.

30:59.906 --> 31:01.388
Oh, he got fired?

31:01.389 --> 31:05.190
He got fired for being drunk
on duty and for beating people.

31:05.191 --> 31:07.793
Police Chief tells him to
stop, draws a service revolver.

31:07.794 --> 31:09.405
Says, stop, don't move.

31:09.406 --> 31:11.234
He starts cursing him,
you're a coward, you're

31:11.235 --> 31:13.491
the one that fired me, you're all rats.

31:13.492 --> 31:16.135
So he had anger towards
this guy, real anger.

31:16.136 --> 31:19.405
Police Chief says, stop, stop, stop.
Boom, plants one right in his chest.

31:19.406 --> 31:20.978
Damn.

31:20.979 --> 31:25.295
Witnesses said that he kept going, because
you kept saying that you were staggering?

31:25.296 --> 31:26.111
Yes.

31:26.112 --> 31:29.209
He staggered right towards
him up until the end then fell.

31:29.210 --> 31:32.450
- And then died.
- Wow.

31:34.387 --> 31:36.895
I came inside.

31:36.896 --> 31:41.396
And there were several
dead people who...

31:41.783 --> 31:46.703
Were commenting, um,
negatively about the decor.

31:46.890 --> 31:52.773
Basically, all of the dead have different
ideas about how this building should look.

31:52.774 --> 31:56.043
It actually gave me
a really bad headache.

31:56.044 --> 31:59.150
The reason we're here is that he can't
get any construction done because every

31:59.151 --> 32:03.684
time they take a hammer and swing
it, there's... activity picks up here.

32:03.685 --> 32:09.457
Yeah. Well, I've been trying to get the
building finished for quite some time.

32:09.458 --> 32:13.499
And every time we seem to
get rolling right along to get

32:13.500 --> 32:17.754
something done, we start
to have increased activity.

32:17.755 --> 32:21.341
And the activity scares
off some of the contractors.

32:21.342 --> 32:22.285
Oh, no.

32:22.286 --> 32:28.186
And the employees, and then we
have to stop and regroup again.

32:29.008 --> 32:31.692
So, what else is going on in
this place? What else you see?

32:31.693 --> 32:36.562
One of the individuals that
was complaining about the

32:36.563 --> 32:41.356
decor in the building was
this elderly woman that I met.

32:41.357 --> 32:43.558
She is really tiny.

32:43.559 --> 32:47.195
She is probably only, like,
five foot. On the heavier side.

32:47.196 --> 32:51.096
She definitely worked a lot here.

32:51.333 --> 32:54.928
I've seen her walking
through the Fairmont Hotel.

32:54.929 --> 32:58.972
And then I've seen her stop
at the edge of the stage.

32:58.973 --> 33:01.977
And just stare at me at the bar.

33:01.978 --> 33:04.245
I've seen her several times.

33:04.246 --> 33:07.219
She startles me if I come
up the back staircase,

33:07.220 --> 33:09.150
because she is always
looking over the railing.

33:09.151 --> 33:13.264
So I got in the habit
of saying, coming up.

33:13.265 --> 33:16.926
Because, really, I don't want
to confront anything here.

33:16.927 --> 33:20.370
Let me ask you a question, is it
possible it is the same woman you saw?

33:20.371 --> 33:22.231
Yes.

33:22.313 --> 33:24.399
Okay, so what else?

33:24.400 --> 33:27.897
When I did a lot of
other walking around,

33:27.898 --> 33:33.576
I finally made it down to the basement
and what I saw was kind of strange.

33:33.577 --> 33:37.122
I saw several women who were...

33:37.123 --> 33:40.882
Down there, and they were nude.

33:40.883 --> 33:44.298
And at first I thought they
were hiding from someone.

33:44.299 --> 33:49.400
But then, I figured out that they were
actually being put down there by someone.

33:49.401 --> 33:51.216
- Really?
- Yes.

33:51.217 --> 33:56.677
And I did hear, at times,
something about sex slavery.

33:57.301 --> 34:01.246
Makes sense, though. This
building was built as a Brothel.

34:01.247 --> 34:06.093
Because of the mining community here,
the ratio of men to women was 50 to 1.

34:06.094 --> 34:08.161
The men that controlled
the prostitutes here did

34:08.161 --> 34:10.391
whatever they wanted to
to keep them under control.

34:10.391 --> 34:12.118
And when they didn't
do what they were told,

34:12.119 --> 34:16.360
a lot of them, from what I
was told, would get beat up.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.562
Well, I did do a sketch of that scene.

34:18.563 --> 34:20.588
- You did?
- Yeah.

34:20.589 --> 34:23.708
Pretty extreme, though.

34:27.938 --> 34:32.259
- Oh, this is what you saw?
- Mm hmm.

34:32.447 --> 34:35.927
That's just a few, though.

34:42.849 --> 34:46.487
There's a terrible vibe in
that area, always has been.

34:46.489 --> 34:49.428
I hate going down there
and getting supplies.

34:49.429 --> 34:51.636
We try to avoid going
down there late at night.

34:51.637 --> 34:53.661
So what is it that you
feel when you're down there?

34:53.663 --> 34:57.083
Extraordinary sadness, pain.

34:57.134 --> 34:58.679
Unpleasantness.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.940
I want to get out as fast as I can.

35:05.027 --> 35:08.532
When I came up to the second floor I...

35:08.533 --> 35:12.228
Encountered a woman that I
think may have, at some point,

35:12.229 --> 35:14.941
been in the basement, simply
because of her appearance.

35:14.942 --> 35:17.244
She talks incessantly.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.012
She probably worked here.

35:19.013 --> 35:22.508
And I did get that she
did sleep with people.

35:22.509 --> 35:26.349
It's very possible that the living...

35:26.350 --> 35:31.692
Might hear some of the commotion
between her and the other dead people.

35:31.693 --> 35:36.255
So, people could possibly
hear her still talking.

35:36.256 --> 35:39.132
Kathleen actually stayed
here for about a week.

35:39.133 --> 35:40.621
Tell her the experience you had.

35:40.622 --> 35:46.522
A woman appeared at the foot of my
bed very briefly and just looked at me.

35:47.240 --> 35:50.568
All of the hair stood up
on the back of my neck.

35:50.569 --> 35:53.174
You seem to have run into
a lot of dead people here.

35:53.175 --> 35:55.114
- Yes.
- Did you run into anybody else?

35:55.115 --> 35:59.330
I was walking by a bedroom
on the third floor...

35:59.331 --> 36:03.695
And I got that someone
had killed themselves.

36:03.696 --> 36:07.116
Um, that it was a female.

36:09.447 --> 36:11.360
She was hysterical.

36:11.361 --> 36:13.298
Very, very sad.

36:13.299 --> 36:17.701
And I felt like she had lost
someone very close to her.

36:17.702 --> 36:22.371
And I got that she killed herself
in a very dramatic fashion.

36:22.372 --> 36:27.129
That's about as accurate of
a hit that I've seen her get.

36:27.130 --> 36:31.198
There was a prostitute back in
1907 named Maggie Broadwater.

36:31.199 --> 36:34.138
Now, I have an article
here that describes

36:34.139 --> 36:36.650
the way she killed
herself and what happened.

36:36.651 --> 36:39.646
She was a prostitute that
worked here and lived here.

36:39.647 --> 36:43.852
Now, the expert I talked to about this said
that she had a relationship that went bad.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.878
And she took it hard
and started drinking,

36:46.879 --> 36:50.076
heavily for about a week straight,
before she killed herself.

36:50.077 --> 36:54.407
Now, you saw a woman when
you lived on the third floor.

36:54.408 --> 36:55.640
Yes, I did.

36:55.641 --> 37:00.429
I saw a woman that fit almost exactly
the same description as she described.

37:00.430 --> 37:03.536
And I woke in the middle
of the night and she

37:03.537 --> 37:06.062
just stood there for
about four or five minutes.

37:06.063 --> 37:08.474
And I never saw her after that.

37:08.475 --> 37:11.380
- You did move out, right?
- I moved out.

37:11.381 --> 37:16.907
I'm uneasy because I don't want
to be involved in the other side.

37:16.908 --> 37:18.828
Okay.

37:19.309 --> 37:20.944
What else did you see?

37:20.945 --> 37:26.345
Then I met a character,
who I called the grumpy man.

37:26.753 --> 37:31.467
He feels like he would like
the third floor to be...

37:31.468 --> 37:34.145
An area just for the
dead people and that no

37:34.146 --> 37:36.859
living people should
be allowed up there.

37:36.860 --> 37:41.017
He does get extremely agitated
and occasionally does lash out.

37:41.018 --> 37:44.608
He does things directed towards the
living that aren't particularly nice.

37:44.609 --> 37:46.206
Like what?

37:46.207 --> 37:49.639
He admitted to having broken
things in the building.

37:49.640 --> 37:53.610
He does want to
physically harm the living.

37:53.611 --> 37:59.511
He does not know how, but he
is trying to teach himself how.

38:14.929 --> 38:19.282
He does get extremely agitated
and occasionally does lash out.

38:19.283 --> 38:22.744
He does things directed towards the
living that aren't particularly nice.

38:22.745 --> 38:24.202
Like what?

38:24.203 --> 38:28.256
He admitted to having broken
things in the building.

38:28.257 --> 38:31.664
He does want to
physically harm the living.

38:31.665 --> 38:37.565
He does not know how, but he
is trying to teach himself how.

38:40.798 --> 38:44.158
That's not very pleasant.

38:44.306 --> 38:46.270
I'm alone here at night.

38:46.271 --> 38:49.701
I'm an older woman. It's alarming.

38:49.702 --> 38:53.148
Does he act in a place other
than the second and third floor?

38:53.149 --> 38:57.248
- Is he downstairs at the bar?
- He is capable to go anywhere.

38:57.249 --> 39:00.042
It bothers me that I hear
that someone might want

39:00.043 --> 39:03.449
to try to harm somebody
or do some mischief here.

39:03.450 --> 39:07.411
Well, you've had investors that have stayed
overnight and physically had their...

39:07.412 --> 39:08.920
Arm moved.

39:08.921 --> 39:12.822
The first time it
happened, I had an investor

39:12.823 --> 39:15.270
of mine who stayed up there to lay down.

39:15.271 --> 39:19.411
And he came down a little bit uh...

39:19.460 --> 39:20.528
Frightened.

39:20.529 --> 39:23.436
And he said when he was
sleeping he was awoken

39:23.437 --> 39:26.403
by somebody moving his
arm off of his chest.

39:26.404 --> 39:31.046
Four or five other people have been in that
room and they all had the same experience.

39:31.047 --> 39:36.947
That would be something that
this person is capable of doing.

39:41.865 --> 39:44.929
Well, you guys have been hit
with a lot of information tonight.

39:44.930 --> 39:47.119
But I think we kind of
know now why you're having

39:47.120 --> 39:49.095
such a hard time getting
this place renovated.

39:49.096 --> 39:52.558
The big question, though, is are you gonna
be able to fulfill your dream and turn this

39:52.559 --> 39:58.082
into the hotel you wanted to, and keep
your staff, your guests, and yourself safe?

39:58.083 --> 40:02.679
For that, I'm gonna turn it over
to Amy to see what she can tell us.

40:02.680 --> 40:06.104
I believe that you can do
what you would like to do,

40:06.105 --> 40:09.454
but it is going to take a bit of work.

40:09.455 --> 40:13.084
So, not only do you have the dead that
people are coming into contact with.

40:13.085 --> 40:16.311
But also all of this residual muck.

40:16.312 --> 40:20.316
Because it's so dense, and
there's so many layers...

40:20.317 --> 40:23.310
This is going to take about a year.

40:23.311 --> 40:27.067
Doing cleansings one
to two times per week.

40:27.068 --> 40:29.392
What kind of a cleansing
are we talking about?

40:29.393 --> 40:31.714
What you need are basic things...

40:31.715 --> 40:34.627
Salt, Sage, and holy water.

40:34.628 --> 40:39.866
The first thing that you're going to do
would be getting some Sage, lighting it.

40:39.867 --> 40:43.715
What this does is it removes the
buildup of the residual energy.

40:43.716 --> 40:48.084
And then, I want you to take
some salt and water, mix it up,

40:48.085 --> 40:53.985
put it into a spray bottle, and
then spray the floors and the walls.

40:54.105 --> 40:58.057
The holy water is going to prevent any

40:58.058 --> 41:00.972
more negative individuals
from coming in.

41:00.973 --> 41:06.873
What it will do is just create a
pure and kind of safe environment.

41:07.094 --> 41:12.994
Once all of this has been done and it's
been about a year, you will see a change.

41:13.230 --> 41:17.171
As far as how people feel, as
far as people's interactions.

41:17.172 --> 41:21.373
The dead that occupy this
location... they'll be gone.

41:21.374 --> 41:23.929
Will he start feeling a
difference sooner than a year?

41:23.930 --> 41:28.070
Yes, but you have to keep doing it.

41:28.167 --> 41:32.403
I feel validated, because
she's brought to light things

41:32.404 --> 41:37.722
that we have seen and it
gives us collective closure.

41:37.723 --> 41:41.549
Now, I'm gonna ask the obvious
question, are you gonna do what she says?

41:41.550 --> 41:43.073
What do you think?

41:43.074 --> 41:44.546
I'll help.

41:44.547 --> 41:47.967
Okay, there's your answer.

41:48.480 --> 41:53.044
It won't be easy removing the layers of
dead people surrounding this location.

41:53.045 --> 41:56.812
But if Ron and Kathleen follow my
advice, the dead will be set free.

41:56.813 --> 42:02.713
And Ron will be able to fulfill his
dream and restore this historic hotel.
