00:12.862 --> 00:14.124
Right now...

00:14.230 --> 00:17.825
...terrorists are plotting to assassinate
a presidential candidate.

00:18.335 --> 00:20.929
My wife and daughter have been targeted...

00:21.171 --> 00:25.335
...and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.675 --> 00:27.768
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer...

00:28.044 --> 00:31.480
...and today is the longest day of my life.

01:01.911 --> 01:02.878
Yeah.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.913
Proceed to Palmer's hotel.

01:05.447 --> 01:06.676
What do you want me to do?

01:06.783 --> 01:09.149
When your government
abducted my father...

01:09.252 --> 01:11.652
...they also froze
$200 million of our assets.

01:12.355 --> 01:14.880
Palmer has the necessary clearance
to unfreeze them.

01:15.158 --> 01:18.389
So in the end, everything that happened
today was because of money?

01:19.562 --> 01:21.291
I wouldn't say that.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.359
That money is ours.

01:23.633 --> 01:26.966
We'll call Palmer at this number
at exactly 10:45.

01:27.570 --> 01:30.596
Once I receive confirmation
of the transfer...

01:30.707 --> 01:32.641
...I'll give you further instructions.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.102
What kind of instructions?

01:40.717 --> 01:42.776
You want me to take out Palmer?

01:42.919 --> 01:44.216
Of course.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.655
That's why we let you go.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.992
That's why we have your daughter.

01:51.428 --> 01:52.690
Jack?

01:53.430 --> 01:54.556
I'm still here.

01:54.664 --> 01:57.531
Remember, we'll call at exactly 10:45.

01:58.435 --> 02:02.166
I trust I don't have to tell you
what will happen if Palmer doesn't answer.

02:21.524 --> 02:22.957
Hello, Patty.

02:23.359 --> 02:24.849
You left the party early.

02:25.328 --> 02:26.693
I wasn't in the mood.

02:26.963 --> 02:28.021
What's up?

02:28.164 --> 02:31.725
I was just wondering if you had a chance
to look at the Dallas schedule.

02:32.635 --> 02:33.795
It's fine.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.295
Good.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.038
Do you need anything else from me?

02:50.453 --> 02:51.681
Sit down.

03:01.130 --> 03:03.462
A little while ago,
we started down a road...

03:03.600 --> 03:06.091
...that was going to take us
to a dangerous place.

03:06.569 --> 03:09.402
I know, and I'm sorry.

03:10.406 --> 03:11.395
Are you?

03:14.410 --> 03:15.468
Sorry?

03:17.614 --> 03:19.809
I'm attracted to you, Senator.

03:20.583 --> 03:22.414
I always have been.

03:31.427 --> 03:33.190
Meet me in 20 minutes...

03:33.396 --> 03:34.761
...in Room 907.

03:38.701 --> 03:40.191
I'll be waiting for you.

03:44.374 --> 03:46.672
Oh, David! Good, I...

03:47.577 --> 03:51.308
I need to talk to you for a second.

03:51.414 --> 03:53.905
I'll just go make those
changes to the schedule.

03:54.017 --> 03:55.484
Thanks, Patty.

04:04.427 --> 04:06.952
I told...

04:07.363 --> 04:09.126
...Keith and Nicole that...

04:09.232 --> 04:12.827
...we're going to stump it separately
for the next couple of days.

04:12.936 --> 04:14.528
What did they say?

04:15.705 --> 04:17.673
They know we're not getting along, David.

04:17.774 --> 04:18.762
Fine.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.365
What are they going to do?

04:20.743 --> 04:22.074
They'll stay with me.

04:22.579 --> 04:25.173
Unless, of course, you want them with you.

04:28.117 --> 04:29.106
No.

04:30.753 --> 04:32.618
I could use a couple of days alone.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.483
Great.

05:00.283 --> 05:02.843
All right, we got to work
under a couple of assumptions.

05:03.019 --> 05:06.250
The only way to find Jack
is through Drazen.

05:06.522 --> 05:09.855
The only way to get to Drazen
is if Alexis takes us there.

05:10.293 --> 05:13.387
So, we've got to devote all of our
resources to finding Alexis.

05:13.496 --> 05:15.828
- Yeah, but he shed the trackers.
- I know.

05:15.932 --> 05:19.663
So we use the satellite
and run computer simulators.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.041
Yeah?

05:26.142 --> 05:27.336
George, it's me.

05:27.443 --> 05:28.501
Jack, are you all right?

05:28.611 --> 05:31.045
Drazen let me go, but I can't come in yet.

05:31.147 --> 05:32.375
What do you mean?

05:32.482 --> 05:35.883
Listen to me. Tell Teri I'm out.
I know she's worried about me.

05:35.985 --> 05:38.249
If Drazen calls,
don't tell him that we talked.

05:38.354 --> 05:39.878
Lt'll put Kim in danger.

05:39.989 --> 05:41.980
Fine, but Jack, let us help you.

05:42.191 --> 05:43.590
George, I got to go.

05:48.564 --> 05:50.623
I don't like the sound of that.

05:51.034 --> 05:52.695
What do you think he's doing?

05:52.802 --> 05:55.134
Drazen let him go for a reason.

05:55.571 --> 05:57.664
Jack won't let us help him.

05:57.807 --> 05:59.832
He won't tell us what he's doing.

06:00.677 --> 06:03.840
Whatever he's doing,
he's trying to protect Kim.

06:06.015 --> 06:09.109
What's the one thing we know
for sure that Drazen wants?

06:09.452 --> 06:10.817
Palmer dead.

06:15.491 --> 06:16.583
Jane.

06:17.527 --> 06:20.792
Connect me with the Palmer suite,
Secret Service.

06:51.260 --> 06:54.058
- What's wrong?
- I can't stop the internal bleeding.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.131
Do not let him die.

06:58.701 --> 06:59.929
Alexis.

07:03.339 --> 07:04.567
Father.

07:09.912 --> 07:11.072
Alexis!

07:12.749 --> 07:14.182
Do something!

07:26.896 --> 07:28.193
I'm sorry.

07:28.731 --> 07:30.528
There's nothing more I can do.

07:38.441 --> 07:39.499
No!

07:39.609 --> 07:40.837
Leave us.

07:41.344 --> 07:42.834
We're family.

07:59.128 --> 08:01.289
First Mother and Martina...

08:04.400 --> 08:05.731
...now Alexis.

08:08.838 --> 08:09.930
And it's Bauer!

08:10.039 --> 08:13.975
- Andre! Not yet, we still need her!
- Let him hear her die!

08:14.076 --> 08:15.008
Andre!

08:46.342 --> 08:48.333
Could you wait for me, please?

08:48.678 --> 08:49.838
Thanks.

08:53.850 --> 08:55.147
Well?

08:55.651 --> 08:56.675
He wants to see me.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.050
- When?
- Tonight.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.555
He didn't waste much time.

09:05.828 --> 09:07.159
How are you doing?

09:08.097 --> 09:09.962
I told you before, I feel uncomfortable...

09:10.066 --> 09:12.000
No, no, Patty, please.

09:12.101 --> 09:13.693
Don't patronize me.

09:14.237 --> 09:16.034
You feel uncomfortable...

09:16.572 --> 09:19.200
...but not because you're ready
to be with my husband.

09:19.742 --> 09:21.300
You feel uncomfortable...

09:21.944 --> 09:24.777
...because you're doing it
with my knowledge and consent.

09:25.915 --> 09:28.509
Why are you doing this, Mrs. Palmer?

09:28.718 --> 09:30.083
It's...

09:30.453 --> 09:34.549
It's important for David's career
that I have his full confidence.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.482
And I no longer have that.

09:39.061 --> 09:41.791
And you want me to get it?

09:41.898 --> 09:44.833
Yes, and report back to me.

09:50.273 --> 09:54.607
- We both know what it's going to...
- Yes, we do.

09:56.579 --> 09:59.673
- And you're okay with that?
- No, I never said I was okay with it.

10:00.549 --> 10:05.248
But I'm willing to accept it,
because it's necessary.

10:13.462 --> 10:15.157
Your elevator's waiting.

10:19.869 --> 10:23.305
Yes, just make sure that Palmer
has an extra layer of security.

10:23.439 --> 10:24.804
It's going to be difficult...

10:24.907 --> 10:25.896
Yes, I know.

10:26.008 --> 10:28.306
- Hey, Nina, got a minute?
- Hold on.

10:28.411 --> 10:29.810
This is important.

10:30.179 --> 10:32.272
Paul, we're done. Okay.

10:33.416 --> 10:34.314
What?

10:34.417 --> 10:37.386
The plans of the facility
where they were holding Victor Drazen?

10:37.486 --> 10:39.784
- Yeah?
- They've been tampered with.

10:42.158 --> 10:45.286
- Who has access to these archives?
- Division and District.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.192
Can you find out who's had
access to these in the last month?

10:48.297 --> 10:50.231
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.592
The sooner the better.

10:55.004 --> 10:57.268
You think we're dealing
with a second dirty agent?

10:57.373 --> 10:58.738
Yeah.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.840
What'd Tony want?

11:05.181 --> 11:08.617
He was just telling me why it was so hard
to pick up a thread on Drazen.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.681
Listen, I need your help.

11:10.786 --> 11:12.845
Teri Bauer's a basket case.

11:13.522 --> 11:15.183
I don't know what you think I can do.

11:15.291 --> 11:19.091
You're good with her.
You calm her down. Come on.

11:19.195 --> 11:21.891
I've got to deal with Chappelle.
D.O.D. is still trying...

11:21.998 --> 11:23.022
All right.

11:23.733 --> 11:25.291
She's in the conference room.

11:25.801 --> 11:26.961
I know.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.135
Is it over? Did they make the trade?

11:36.245 --> 11:38.805
Jack's safe. He's no longer a hostage.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.313
Is he on his way?

11:41.584 --> 11:43.211
We don't know where he is.

11:43.319 --> 11:44.377
What?

11:44.520 --> 11:47.921
He called in to tell us he was okay,
but he didn't say anything else.

11:48.024 --> 11:49.013
Why not?

11:49.125 --> 11:51.992
I think it's because Drazen wants him
to do something.

11:52.094 --> 11:55.495
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would he do anything for that man?

11:56.032 --> 11:58.364
I think it's to protect Kim.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.059
What are you talking about?

12:01.370 --> 12:04.100
Teri, the reason that Kim isn't back
is because...

12:04.206 --> 12:06.674
- No, no, no.
- No, just listen to me.

12:06.776 --> 12:10.234
We think that's where Jack is now.
He's trying to bring Kim back.

12:10.346 --> 12:12.177
He's not communicating with us...

12:12.715 --> 12:14.774
...to protect her.

12:20.890 --> 12:22.187
I'm sorry.

13:11.073 --> 13:14.406
The task we have given your father
is a simple one.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.440
And if he does it...

13:19.515 --> 13:21.210
...will you let me go?

13:24.753 --> 13:26.118
We will see.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.705
Jack, I just got your message.

13:47.810 --> 13:49.937
Senator, I need to see you right away.

13:50.045 --> 13:51.876
Your office said you might be coming here.

13:51.981 --> 13:53.039
I am coming there.

13:53.149 --> 13:55.845
- Why?
- I have a message from Victor Drazen.

13:56.452 --> 13:58.920
Yeah, they also said that Drazen
has your daughter...

13:59.021 --> 14:00.488
...and that you could be a threat.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.318
They've added to my security...

14:02.591 --> 14:05.287
...and Secret Service has been told
not to let you near me.

14:05.394 --> 14:09.091
Senator, they do have my daughter,
but I'm not coming there to harm you.

14:12.334 --> 14:13.733
What does Drazen want you to do?

14:13.903 --> 14:15.996
He wants to speak to you
on the phone at 10:45.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.471
He's given me a scrambled phone.
It can't be traced.

14:18.574 --> 14:20.337
- What does he want to talk about?
- Money.

14:20.442 --> 14:24.435
I'll explain everything when I get there.
Just tell your people to let me through.

14:25.247 --> 14:28.774
Drazen's people, who are holding
your daughter hostage, want me dead.

14:28.884 --> 14:30.579
You're asking a lot, Jack.

14:30.786 --> 14:34.847
They had my wife and daughter this
morning and I managed to save your life.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.256
I'm not coming there to harm you
in any way. I give you my word, sir.

15:12.027 --> 15:13.289
Hi.

15:13.629 --> 15:15.096
Did anyone see you come up?

15:15.798 --> 15:17.197
No, I was careful.

15:20.269 --> 15:21.736
Why don't you sit down?

15:30.479 --> 15:32.470
How much time do we have?

15:36.218 --> 15:37.776
Don't worry about that.

15:41.790 --> 15:44.384
I have something I want to tell you, Patty.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.219
Yes?

15:53.302 --> 15:54.735
You're fired.

15:57.506 --> 15:59.701
Pack up. Get out.

16:00.409 --> 16:04.209
And don't bother to ask me or anyone
else on my staff for a reference.

16:04.513 --> 16:07.049
Prospective employers won't like
what I'll have to say.

16:07.283 --> 16:08.773
I don't understand.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.408
I know what you're doing.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.179
You're working with my wife against me.

16:14.256 --> 16:16.520
Senator, I'm sorry.

16:16.859 --> 16:19.191
I didn't mean to deceive you like this.

16:19.795 --> 16:22.958
It's just that your wife insisted,
and I didn't know what to say.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.930
- "No," would have done it.
- I know.

16:25.034 --> 16:26.729
I know I should have.

16:27.303 --> 16:28.702
It's just that...

16:29.004 --> 16:31.302
...she can be pretty scary sometimes.

16:31.540 --> 16:32.529
So can I.

16:32.641 --> 16:35.906
Senator, obviously, I have made
a terrible mistake in judgment.

16:36.011 --> 16:37.945
If I can earn a second chance...

16:38.047 --> 16:40.379
I want you out of this hotel in 30 minutes.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.427
You've got to take a look at this.

17:03.539 --> 17:07.531
These are the six people that have accessed
the detention facility archives, right?

17:07.643 --> 17:10.134
The first five were just doing
scheduled backups.

17:10.479 --> 17:12.070
Here's the sixth.

17:13.415 --> 17:14.575
George?

17:18.619 --> 17:20.315
George is the mole?

17:21.089 --> 17:22.215
It's possible.

17:23.092 --> 17:25.287
I mean, he accessed that file four days ago.

17:25.394 --> 17:27.919
Why would he have done that
if he wasn't involved?

17:31.433 --> 17:32.730
You got to call Chappelle.

17:32.835 --> 17:35.201
No, you need to shut down
his network access.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.534
You can't let anything go in or out.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.802
Okay, I just got to figure out
how I'm going to do it.

17:59.395 --> 18:00.885
Where were you?

18:01.330 --> 18:02.661
Downstairs.

18:03.365 --> 18:04.559
Downstairs?

18:04.933 --> 18:08.232
Yeah, in Room 907...

18:08.837 --> 18:10.134
...with Patty.

18:11.774 --> 18:12.763
What?

18:13.809 --> 18:15.777
Save your energy, Sherry.

18:16.478 --> 18:18.446
No need to act surprised.

18:22.084 --> 18:23.210
I fired her.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.592
You know your problem, David?

18:35.697 --> 18:39.098
You think everyone's conspiring
against you...

18:39.735 --> 18:41.999
...when in fact we're just trying to help.

18:42.971 --> 18:45.064
By putting another woman in my bed?

18:45.707 --> 18:48.676
- Do you realize how sick that is?
- Come on.

18:48.844 --> 18:50.778
We chose a certain life.

18:50.979 --> 18:53.470
And we chose that a long time ago.

18:53.782 --> 18:57.445
It's not about a house in the suburbs
and PTA meetings.

18:57.686 --> 19:00.018
And whether you're willing
to accept it or not...

19:00.122 --> 19:01.953
...we serve a higher purpose.

19:02.057 --> 19:06.153
You are not qualified to talk
about higher purposes.

19:06.261 --> 19:08.229
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.

19:11.266 --> 19:15.202
We are about to move
into the White House.

19:16.605 --> 19:18.732
That's right. We.

19:19.141 --> 19:20.438
You and I.

19:21.176 --> 19:26.045
And all the issues, all the politics,
all the hard work...

19:26.315 --> 19:28.840
...that's going to help get us there...

19:28.951 --> 19:31.419
...I'm as much a part of that as you.

19:31.820 --> 19:34.015
So don't even try to deny it.

19:34.957 --> 19:36.083
Please, Sherry.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.248
Don't go there.

19:38.961 --> 19:43.489
I'm not begrudging a single thing, David.
I don't need the limelight.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.033
- You sent her to spy on me.
- That's right.

19:46.134 --> 19:48.261
- And do you want to know why?
- Yes, I do.

19:48.370 --> 19:50.770
Because you need me to look out for you.

19:51.206 --> 19:53.606
And if you cut me out
of your inner circle...

19:53.709 --> 19:57.873
...like you threatened earlier today,
you will fail in every way.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.278
You need me, David.

20:01.350 --> 20:02.408
What?

20:03.986 --> 20:07.513
- Jack Bauer just arrived, sir.
- I'll be out in a moment.

20:17.866 --> 20:19.595
We're not done here.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.814
- Jack.
- Senator.

20:36.685 --> 20:39.848
Convincing Secret Service
to allow you to come up here to see me...

20:39.955 --> 20:41.286
...was difficult enough.

20:41.390 --> 20:44.052
- They won't let me out of sight.
- That's fine.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.821
You just need to talk
to Victor Drazen when he calls...

20:46.929 --> 20:49.227
...listen to his demands, and cooperate.

20:49.398 --> 20:52.128
How did he get your daughter?
I thought she was protected.

20:52.234 --> 20:55.397
I did, too. We don't have much time.
He could call any second.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.971
You said this was about money.

20:57.072 --> 21:00.303
Yes, $200 million of his was frozen
after he was abducted.

21:00.409 --> 21:01.740
- And?
- He wants it.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.243
He says you have the clearance
to get it back to him.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.372
He's going to give you
instructions when he calls.

21:07.482 --> 21:10.474
That's why Drazen sent you here?
To get me to release his funds?

21:10.586 --> 21:13.054
As soon as he has confirmation
on the wire transfer...

21:13.188 --> 21:15.816
...he's going to ask me
to take action against you.

21:16.425 --> 21:17.517
To kill me.

21:17.726 --> 21:21.287
Yes. Of course, I would never do you
any harm, Senator. You know that.

21:21.396 --> 21:24.058
He has my daughter.
I'm just trying to buy some time.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.960
Jack, I don't have the authority
to transfer those funds...

21:28.070 --> 21:29.298
...and Drazen knows that.

21:29.404 --> 21:31.565
- What do you mean?
- He knows our system.

21:31.673 --> 21:33.072
That money's gone.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.670
To be honest with you,
I don't think that's the reason he's calling.

21:38.981 --> 21:42.280
Senator, please. Answer this phone.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.024
Okay, Jack.

21:58.133 --> 21:59.293
I'll do what I can.

21:59.501 --> 22:01.401
I'll tell him what he wants to hear.

22:01.637 --> 22:03.571
I can't guarantee he'll buy it.

22:03.672 --> 22:04.969
Thank you.

22:07.376 --> 22:08.570
This is David Palmer.

22:08.677 --> 22:12.875
Senator Palmer,
it must be nice being reunited...

22:12.981 --> 22:15.040
...with your friend Jack Bauer.

22:15.150 --> 22:16.742
What do you want?

22:17.753 --> 22:19.220
Drazen?

22:20.222 --> 22:23.089
He knows you can't get the money.
Senator!

22:24.126 --> 22:25.115
No!

22:35.671 --> 22:36.638
No.

22:50.686 --> 22:51.812
Are you all right, sir?

23:05.600 --> 23:08.330
A detonation of this magnitude
had to be military plastique.

23:08.437 --> 23:11.235
See if you can get a powder residue.
We'll try and trace it.

23:11.339 --> 23:12.567
Yes, sir.

23:21.216 --> 23:22.478
Where is he?

23:23.118 --> 23:24.745
- This area's not...
- David!

23:24.853 --> 23:26.081
Let her through.

23:26.354 --> 23:28.618
Just calm down.
Where's Keith and Nicole?

23:28.724 --> 23:30.692
They're downstairs. Are you all right?

23:30.792 --> 23:32.726
- I'm fine.
- Oh, God.

23:32.828 --> 23:33.817
Senator.

23:33.929 --> 23:37.456
Sherry, this is Jack Bauer,
the man who saved my life twice today.

23:37.566 --> 23:38.760
Mrs. Palmer.

23:38.867 --> 23:41.700
- And the man that put your life in danger.
- Sherry, please.

23:41.803 --> 23:43.532
I need a status report
on the Senator.

23:43.638 --> 23:44.764
Don't answer that yet.

23:44.873 --> 23:47.899
Senator, we need to talk about this.
My daughter...

23:48.009 --> 23:50.102
Tell them you don't know yet.

23:50.579 --> 23:53.207
This is Ron.
We don't have a 20 on the Senator yet.

23:53.348 --> 23:54.280
Copy that.

23:54.382 --> 23:55.349
What's going on?

23:55.450 --> 23:57.714
The man that planned
this explosion...

23:57.819 --> 24:00.253
...needs to believe that it was a success.

24:00.355 --> 24:01.982
Wait a minute, you mean...

24:02.090 --> 24:04.285
...you want the world to think
that David is dead?

24:04.593 --> 24:05.685
Yes, ma'am.

24:05.961 --> 24:07.360
Absolutely not.

24:07.462 --> 24:09.293
David, what's this all about?

24:11.233 --> 24:13.701
His daughter's being held hostage.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.466
But we can't have people thinking...

24:16.571 --> 24:19.131
...that David was assassinated.
It's preposterous.

24:19.241 --> 24:20.902
If we don't, my daughter will die.

24:21.009 --> 24:23.375
Then what do you suggest we do,
Mr. Bauer?

24:23.478 --> 24:25.537
We keep him quarantined
for the next few hours.

24:25.647 --> 24:28.673
We leak a story to the press
that he was killed in the explosion.

24:28.784 --> 24:30.342
You've got to be kidding.

24:30.452 --> 24:33.250
I've never been more serious in my life.

24:41.830 --> 24:42.819
No.

24:43.365 --> 24:45.526
No, it's not going to happen.
David, tell him.

24:45.634 --> 24:47.659
We're talking about
the life of a young girl.

24:47.769 --> 24:50.704
We cannot keep playing games
with the public...

24:50.806 --> 24:52.273
...and expect to keep their trust.

24:52.374 --> 24:55.707
If we're going to do this,
we need to do this now.

25:02.184 --> 25:03.173
Go downstairs.

25:03.285 --> 25:05.082
Bring the children up. Talk to no one.

25:05.187 --> 25:06.484
I mean it.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.388
I need the Secret Service agents
that have seen the Senator.

25:11.493 --> 25:14.519
- Sir, who is your senior Chief of Staff?
- Mike Novick.

25:14.629 --> 25:16.790
Bring him in.
We'll brief him at the same time.

25:16.898 --> 25:18.763
As soon as Mr. Palmer's family gets here...

25:18.867 --> 25:20.630
...no one is to enter or exit this area.

25:20.735 --> 25:22.726
Is that understood? Good.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.470
Now, Sherry.

25:30.645 --> 25:31.805
I'm very sorry, Senator.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.575
Don't worry about it.
Are you sure this is going to work?

25:34.683 --> 25:35.980
It has to.

25:42.691 --> 25:45.524
Almeida, what's going on
with my network access?

25:45.827 --> 25:46.919
What do you mean?

25:47.028 --> 25:50.464
I can't get into archives.
I can't access Palmer's itinerary.

25:50.665 --> 25:51.757
I'll call ITS.

25:51.867 --> 25:53.596
Not enough time for that. Are you up?

25:53.702 --> 25:55.363
Yeah, I think so.

25:57.839 --> 25:59.306
Yeah, here it is.

25:59.507 --> 26:02.032
Okay, so Palmer's still going
to Dallas tomorrow.

26:02.277 --> 26:05.007
Call Secret Service and find out
what time his plane leaves.

26:05.113 --> 26:07.240
Division's got it covered.
I don't think...

26:07.349 --> 26:11.615
Real simple. Call Secret Service,
find out what time his plane leaves.

26:13.355 --> 26:15.823
And get my network up and running.

26:26.301 --> 26:27.359
What happened?

26:27.469 --> 26:28.993
He found out he's cut off.

26:29.104 --> 26:30.765
He also seems overly interested...

26:30.872 --> 26:32.999
...in what happens to Palmer
after he leaves LA.

26:33.108 --> 26:35.099
We should alert Chappelle.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.834
I don't know, not yet.

26:38.079 --> 26:40.673
If we go to him without evidence,
he'll slice us up.

26:40.782 --> 26:42.113
And what about his access?

26:42.217 --> 26:44.185
I'm going to have to restore it.

26:44.653 --> 26:47.315
All right, but monitor everything
and send it to me.

26:47.455 --> 26:48.422
Right.

26:48.790 --> 26:50.849
Put it up on all the monitors.

26:50.959 --> 26:53.052
Everybody, eyes on monitors.

26:54.796 --> 26:56.889
Events are unfolding by the minute...

26:56.998 --> 26:59.262
...in this tragic and stunning development.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.766
The hotel has been sealed off...

27:00.869 --> 27:04.635
...and only a few authorized personnel
are being allowed inside.

27:04.839 --> 27:06.773
But we have just heard
from a spokesperson...

27:06.875 --> 27:08.809
...from the Palmer camp
who has confirmed...

27:08.910 --> 27:11.572
...that Senator David Palmer
has been killed...

27:11.780 --> 27:12.906
...in an explosion.

27:13.014 --> 27:14.948
There is speculation this may be related...

27:15.050 --> 27:17.177
...to this morning's assassination attempt...

27:17.285 --> 27:20.254
...but at this time,
no one has been arrested.

27:22.190 --> 27:23.555
We did it, Father.

27:23.692 --> 27:24.989
We did it.

27:25.860 --> 27:26.884
Yes.

27:28.596 --> 27:31.087
I'll take care of the girl.
Then we can leave.

27:31.199 --> 27:33.394
Do not do anything until we know...

27:33.501 --> 27:36.368
...that Jack Bauer is dead. Do nothing.

27:51.886 --> 27:54.320
Sir, we just contacted Mike Novick.
He's on his way.

27:54.422 --> 27:55.184
Good.

27:55.290 --> 27:57.383
Agent Bauer, it's for you.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.056
Thank you.

28:00.695 --> 28:01.627
Yeah?

28:01.730 --> 28:04.699
You're a very lucky man, Mr. Bauer.

28:06.401 --> 28:08.528
I was calling to confirm your death...

28:08.636 --> 28:10.126
...but I see you've survived.

28:10.238 --> 28:13.799
Andre, I have an offer to make you.

28:14.175 --> 28:15.972
You've already killed Senator Palmer...

28:16.077 --> 28:17.977
...I'm the last person on your list.

28:18.079 --> 28:20.309
I'll make you a trade, me for my daughter.

28:23.385 --> 28:25.444
Come to Port of Los Angeles.

28:25.553 --> 28:26.815
Dock 11-A.

28:26.921 --> 28:29.890
What assurance do I have
that you'll let her go when I arrive?

28:29.991 --> 28:31.117
Sadly, none.

28:31.860 --> 28:33.452
But we've decided...

28:33.661 --> 28:36.653
...the sins of the father
need not be visited upon her.

28:37.165 --> 28:38.894
Port of Los Angeles, Dock 11-A.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.490
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

28:40.602 --> 28:41.569
And, Jack...

28:42.103 --> 28:46.767
...if you bring your colleagues,
or involve them in any way, we'll know.

28:47.609 --> 28:49.042
I understand.

28:51.646 --> 28:53.307
I have to go alone.

28:53.415 --> 28:54.677
Good luck.

28:54.783 --> 28:56.273
Thank you, sir.

29:04.025 --> 29:06.289
Why are you doing this to us?

29:13.168 --> 29:14.760
Yeah, Jack, I can tell him.

29:14.869 --> 29:17.702
But you should really let us
help you on this.

29:17.806 --> 29:19.364
No, I can't. Not yet.

29:19.474 --> 29:22.102
At least give us the general
position so we can be nearby.

29:22.210 --> 29:23.302
I said no.

29:23.411 --> 29:25.641
If Drazen has someone
else working on the inside...

29:25.747 --> 29:27.578
...it could put Kim in danger.

29:28.149 --> 29:29.047
Right.

29:29.150 --> 29:30.913
Let me speak to Teri.

29:31.553 --> 29:32.747
Okay.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.322
Jack.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.692
Jack?

29:39.828 --> 29:41.386
Hey, sweetheart, how you holding up?

29:41.496 --> 29:43.123
Where are you?
Do you know about Kim?

29:43.231 --> 29:44.823
Yes. I'm going to pick her up.

29:44.933 --> 29:45.991
She's fine.

29:46.101 --> 29:47.398
Where is she?

29:47.502 --> 29:49.026
I can't say right now, sweetheart...

29:49.137 --> 29:51.697
...but I promise you, soon,
she's going to be with you.

29:51.806 --> 29:54.604
Thank God. Look, Jack,
what do you mean "she"?

29:54.709 --> 29:55.906
What about you?

29:56.010 --> 29:58.535
I'm sorry, I meant to say "both of us."

29:58.646 --> 29:59.874
Oh, good.

30:00.115 --> 30:03.278
I just don't think
I can take much more of this.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.045
I need you both here, Jack.

30:05.253 --> 30:06.413
I know, sweetheart.

30:06.521 --> 30:07.954
Look, it's almost over.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.581
- Just hang in there, okay?
- Okay.

30:11.292 --> 30:12.281
Teri?

30:12.393 --> 30:13.451
What?

30:17.565 --> 30:18.896
I love you.

30:19.167 --> 30:20.930
I love you, too, Jack.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.603
Honey...

30:26.074 --> 30:28.508
There's something I have to tell you, I...

30:28.610 --> 30:31.306
I've been waiting for the right time.

30:31.412 --> 30:32.743
What is it?

30:34.849 --> 30:37.841
You're going to be a father. Again.

30:39.587 --> 30:42.886
What are you saying?
That you're pregnant?

30:42.991 --> 30:46.256
Yes, that's generally how it works.

30:48.830 --> 30:49.762
Jack?

30:49.864 --> 30:51.354
I'm still here.

30:51.799 --> 30:54.131
I'm sorry.

30:54.235 --> 30:56.897
It was the last thing I thought
you were going to say.

30:57.472 --> 31:00.032
Are you all right with this?
Are you happy about this?

31:00.475 --> 31:02.500
Oh, yes, I am.

31:05.013 --> 31:06.878
I keep thinking that...

31:08.583 --> 31:11.211
...maybe it's the second chance
we've been talking about.

31:14.055 --> 31:15.522
Are you there?

31:17.692 --> 31:19.557
Yeah, I'm still here.

31:19.994 --> 31:21.791
Are you happy about it?

31:21.996 --> 31:23.020
Yes.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.565
Yes, I'm happy about it.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.463
I'm very, very happy.

31:29.837 --> 31:30.895
Good.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.735
Are you sure everything's okay?

31:34.876 --> 31:35.934
Yeah.

31:37.645 --> 31:40.637
Sweetheart, I promise you...

31:40.748 --> 31:43.046
...everything is going to be okay.

31:43.151 --> 31:47.281
It's just been a really, really long day.

31:50.925 --> 31:53.826
Just get on back here
so we can all go home, okay?

31:54.896 --> 31:55.954
Okay.

31:56.864 --> 32:00.231
Teri, I love you so much.

32:02.904 --> 32:04.030
I love you, too, Jack.

32:05.807 --> 32:07.434
I'll see you soon.

32:49.984 --> 32:51.713
I had a sister once.

32:53.655 --> 32:57.022
She was full of life, like you.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.961
She was a photographer,
took hundreds of pictures.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.361
I used to love looking at them.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.168
I can't do that anymore.

33:11.606 --> 33:13.437
You know how she died?

33:14.876 --> 33:16.605
Has anyone told you?

33:19.280 --> 33:21.145
Your father killed her.

33:21.816 --> 33:24.114
My father would never kill innocent people.

33:24.218 --> 33:26.209
You wanted to know. Now I'm telling you.

33:26.321 --> 33:27.310
I don't believe you.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.686
He says it was an accident.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.890
When a man goes halfway
around the world...

33:33.995 --> 33:35.587
...to set off a bomb...

33:35.763 --> 33:39.859
...he's responsible
for any accidents that result.

33:44.505 --> 33:47.406
Has your father ever talked
about his work?

33:49.277 --> 33:53.941
About where he goes
on those long trips overseas?

33:57.752 --> 33:59.219
Of course not.

34:00.088 --> 34:01.055
He can't.

34:01.956 --> 34:04.948
- Because he's a criminal.
- My father is a good man.

34:09.197 --> 34:10.391
No...

34:12.433 --> 34:13.400
...he's not.

34:45.266 --> 34:47.029
Palmer's still alive.

34:47.368 --> 34:51.327
The suite at his hotel blew up,
but apparently he got out unscathed.

34:53.306 --> 34:55.969
- Why the news reports?
- I haven't been fully debriefed...

34:56.077 --> 34:58.910
...but I guess it makes sense
as a defensive strategy.

34:59.013 --> 35:02.039
Palmer's safe as long as the hitters
think he's dead.

35:02.150 --> 35:04.744
So this goes no further
than the three of us...

35:04.852 --> 35:07.252
...until the public's been told
that he survived, all right?

35:07.522 --> 35:09.114
What about the perpetrators?

35:09.223 --> 35:13.125
It's unclear. Our intel is being refreshed
by Secret Service as we speak.

35:13.227 --> 35:16.321
So stay at your stations,
start rebuilding profiles...

35:16.431 --> 35:18.058
...based on the incoming information.

35:18.166 --> 35:20.760
We'll have a new plan
in place within the hour.

35:20.868 --> 35:23.666
Have either of you spoken to Jack
since he first called?

35:23.771 --> 35:24.931
Not me.

35:26.073 --> 35:28.906
Doesn't matter.
This'll all be over soon anyway.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.082
Have you talked to Jack?

35:42.190 --> 35:45.182
Yeah, he called,
but he won't let us help him.

36:00.274 --> 36:04.404
You know, it's kind of cold.
Do you mind if I have some coffee?

37:50.718 --> 37:53.186
Stop right there, Kim! Don't move!

37:58.092 --> 38:00.492
Don't be foolish, you'll drown.

39:40.094 --> 39:42.688
How are we going to do this
without the girl?

39:42.797 --> 39:45.357
Bauer has no choice but to trust us.

40:20.568 --> 40:21.967
Oh, there you are.

40:22.069 --> 40:24.060
We just got some new intel from Langley.

40:24.171 --> 40:27.231
- Oh, good.
- Yeah, take a look at this.
