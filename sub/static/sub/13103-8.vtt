WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.872
Shh. Someone.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.746
(gaSDS)

00:13.347 --> 00:14.883
(lowered voice)
You're sure it was him?

00:14.932 --> 00:15.921
(lowered voice) I don't know.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.350
What the hell is he doing here?
I don't--

00:18.644 --> 00:20.305
Car's just over there.
We can do this.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.390
Yeah, but what about that
open spot? We might be in range.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.805
We don't have much of a choice.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.938
(sighs) Come on.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.190
Okay. Let's go.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.227
(siren wailing in distance)

00:36.370 --> 00:38.201
- Wait.
- Six o'clock..

00:38.247 --> 00:39.453
Down. Get down.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.829
(engine starts)

00:40.874 --> 00:41.989
Ow!

00:42.042 --> 00:43.907
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.376
Okay, let's go.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.621
- Ow!
- Shh.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.338
Okay.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.340
Ohh!

01:00.394 --> 01:01.383
Ow!

01:01.436 --> 01:04.394
(Gail panting)
Okay. Tell me we made it.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.435
We made it.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.641
- All right.
- All right.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.105
All right, kiss me!

01:11.154 --> 01:12.143
Mmm!

01:12.197 --> 01:13.903
(muffled voice) Mmm. Yeah.

01:13.949 --> 01:14.984
(chuckling) You...

01:15.033 --> 01:17.490
- No, you look really cute.
- No, no.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.151
(tapping on window)
(screams)

01:19.204 --> 01:21.286
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- (screaming) What?!

01:21.331 --> 01:23.196
l frickin' knew you guys
were together!

01:23.250 --> 01:25.366
- Dov!
- I should write you up.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.499
- I'd be doing you a favor.
- You are gross!

01:26.545 --> 01:27.751
- Dov!
- You need help!

01:27.796 --> 01:28.876
(Dov) You're lucky
my camera phone's broken.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.379
I know where you live!
I can't be|--

01:31.425 --> 01:33.086
(panting)

01:33.135 --> 01:35.877
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.217
(Forest City Lovers)
J‘ You took the land and changed it .l‘

01:39.266 --> 01:41.222
It's all about saving
the pennies, brother.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.883
Gotta save the pennies.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.093
You shouldn't have.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.557
I didn't.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.222
(laughing) Ouch.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.482
Who's the lucky girl?

01:50.527 --> 01:51.516
Jerry.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.310
(laughs) I don't know.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.445
Bounce in your step,
twinkle in your eye--

01:55.490 --> 01:57.981
I didn't know any better,
l'd swear you were in love.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.617
- (laughs)
- .l‘ Don't go .l‘

02:00.662 --> 02:03.745
.l‘ Please don't go .l‘

02:03.790 --> 02:06.327
(indistinct conversations)

02:07.419 --> 02:09.501
Hey, Swarek.

02:09.546 --> 02:10.831
.l‘ Now the rain's... J‘

02:10.881 --> 02:11.916
- We need to talk.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.586
Is this about McNally?

02:15.636 --> 02:16.671
Yeah.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.678
I need your help.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.093
Today's her first shift back on
since the shooting,

02:22.142 --> 02:24.098
and I'm just worried
it's gonna be a little weird for her.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.429
Okay, so?

02:25.479 --> 02:29.063
So, uh, I am taking her to my fishing cabin
on Simcoe for the night,

02:29.107 --> 02:31.644
give her a chance to unwind, clear her head,

02:31.693 --> 02:34.400
but it is an hour-and-a-half drive after shift.

02:34.446 --> 02:35.856
Do me a favor and make sure
she gets out of here,

02:35.906 --> 02:38.067
doesn't get caught up in anything
so we can leave on time?

02:38.116 --> 02:39.777
McNally's going up to your fishing cabin?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.327
Yeah. It's her idea.

02:41.370 --> 02:44.453
Oh. Oh, shejust doesn't strike me
as the fishing type.

02:44.498 --> 02:48.116
Sammy, a fishing cabin really has
very little to do with actually fishing.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.783
Right, right. Yeah, sure, okay.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.543
Uh, yeah, no problem.
I won't get in your way.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.001
Thanks. All right.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.422
(plunk)

03:04.810 --> 03:06.641
You followed us last night.
That was creepy.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.678
No, it wasn't creepy. It was stealthy.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.686
What was creepy
was you knocking boots

03:10.732 --> 03:12.268
in an all-night diner with Gail.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.308
Hey, my fiancee and l--
we just broke up.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.601
This thing with Gail, it's new.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.610
We want to keep it discreet, okay?

03:17.656 --> 03:19.271
- Denise wasn't your fiancee.
- Hey.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.985
Relax, okay? It's in the vault.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.535
I've heard that one before.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.158
- Excuse me, you can afford 200?
- Yeah.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.445
- Why wouldn't I bet on you?
- So, yeah.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.329
I mean, you know,
I th--| think that's only fair.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.331
(Noelle) All right. Fine.
Fine, 200...

03:30.377 --> 03:31.833
(Sam) It's gotta be even.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.379
Oh, you gotta put your money down
first, right, 'cause--

03:33.422 --> 03:34.411
What, you don't trust me?

03:34.464 --> 03:35.499
- l--No, |--
- You know I got...

03:37.551 --> 03:39.917
What's wrong with you?
It looks like you've been run over.

03:39.970 --> 03:40.959
Yeah, by fun.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.468
He was at The Penny till close.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.755
- So you're hung over?
- Mm-hmm.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.673
And we're doing community outreach.
Good times.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.513
Livin' the dream.

03:49.688 --> 03:50.677
Coppers of 15.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.518
- Oh, look at that shirt!
- Nice.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.649
(applause)

03:58.405 --> 03:59.815
(Frank) All right.
Thank you, thank you.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.356
Uh, before we start,
I have a couple of messages to share.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.492
First, former Staff Sergeant Boyko
says hi from headquarters.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.902
He wants to make sure
you're all listening to me,

04:06.955 --> 04:09.287
giving me the respect that I deserve.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.790
Second, from our wounded officer
Oliver Shaw.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.498
It says, "Thank you for your
wonderful cards and flowers,

04:15.547 --> 04:18.129
but please get serious.
Send food."

04:18.175 --> 04:19.540
(laughter)

04:19.593 --> 04:21.208
Okay, down to business.

04:21.261 --> 04:25.049
Today is our off-duty retraining
for all senior officers.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.338
- (laughs)
- Whoo!

04:26.391 --> 04:29.053
And, as you know, retraining is my baby,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.184
so like every year, it's not gonna be pretty.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.266
Rookies, you'll be,
uh, spending your paid off-duty

04:34.316 --> 04:36.773
at the local high schools
doing community outreach.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.853
Sweet.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.985
Except for Officer Peck,

04:40.030 --> 04:42.737
who will have the honor of
helping me out with the retests.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.775
Officer Peck, please join me.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.282
(lowered voice)
She is so far up his balloon knot.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.571
(laughs)

04:50.624 --> 04:52.740
Rookies, pick up your assignments
on the way out.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.954
The rest of you,
get ready to serve, protect

04:55.003 --> 04:56.709
and have your asses thoroughly kicked.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.620
Ha ha! I don't think so.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.923
Thanks. Thanks, boss.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.755
(Traci) Thank you so much.
This is so awesome.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.556
Sam.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.560
Look, I know we haven't seen
each other since the, um--

05:13.605 --> 05:15.766
Look, ljust--
I really think we need to talk.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.855
Andy, it's cool.
It was what it was, okay?

05:19.903 --> 05:22.144
What--What? What do you mean,
"It was what it was"?

05:22.197 --> 05:24.779
Look, I know it's your specialty,

05:24.825 --> 05:27.441
but let's--let's try not
to overthink this one, okay?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.700
(woman) You're not gonna
try that again, right?

05:34.751 --> 05:35.740
Hey, you.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.500
Oh, hey. Um...

05:37.546 --> 05:39.912
So we are all set for tonight.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.546
Yeah. You know, um...

05:41.591 --> 05:43.127
Luke, I don't--l don't
really know if tonight's--

05:43.176 --> 05:45.553
Hey, no, no. It's okay.
I already talked to Swarek.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.634
- You did?
- Yeah, it's all fine.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.140
As far as he's concerned,
you're all mine.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.727
- Great.
- Yeah.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.228
That's--That's great.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.855
- Okay.
- Yeah.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.573
(siren wailing in distance)

06:19.838 --> 06:21.203
All right, Millben Tech
or Renfield Prep?

06:21.256 --> 06:24.464
- Prep. All the way.
- No, high school's bad enough.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.886
I don't want to deal with
a bunch of entitled rich kids.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.429
Excuse me. That's my alma mater.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.802
Figures.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.055
All right, we'll take Tech.
This is gonna be awesome.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.182
(sighs) Yeah, awesome.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.183
Bad associations, huh?

06:36.229 --> 06:42.316
Well, you know, teen mom,
unpopular, shunned.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.520
Kids can be so cruel.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.982
Yeah. Kids.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.113
Have fun. (blows whistle)

06:48.158 --> 06:50.023
(thud)

06:50.076 --> 06:53.113
Can you please try to take it
a little slow on the speed bumps?

06:53.163 --> 06:55.404
You know, it figures you're hung over.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.947
We're going back to high school.
We're supposed to be hung over.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.707
You volunteered us
for the snobbiest school in the city.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.869
Uh--Pfft. I went there.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.162
It holds a special place in my heart.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.374
Yeah, you keep saying.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.506
I thought your parents were hippies.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.008
They were. My grandma paid.
It was amazing.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.385
I mean, the second I got there,

07:10.430 --> 07:13.046
l was, like, anointed
the king of Renfield Prep.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.555
I'm in student council,
cheerleading...

07:14.601 --> 07:15.807
(chuckles) Cheerleading?

07:15.852 --> 07:18.184
(mouth full) Yeah.
It was a coed spirit thing.

07:18.229 --> 07:21.016
Well, school spirit's
not really my thing,

07:21.066 --> 07:23.808
because high school
was not the best time in my life.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.940
(normal voice)
You're cute and fun.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.362
How bad could it have been?

07:26.404 --> 07:30.773
Um, well, I spent six months
trying to hide the fact that l was pregnant

07:30.825 --> 07:33.908
and, uh, the next two years
trying to hide from all the fallout.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.410
So, yeah, it was amazing.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.535
Oh, look, a speed bump!

07:36.581 --> 07:38.537
(Traci chuckles)
(thud)

07:39.292 --> 07:40.281
(Chris) What if they ask you,

07:40.335 --> 07:41.666
"What's your favorite thing
about being a cop?"

07:41.711 --> 07:42.700
What do you say?

07:42.754 --> 07:45.040
Well, I'm gonna say
the feeling of polyester pants

07:45.090 --> 07:47.251
after you start to sweat a bit.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.758
Seriously.
I mean, how do you choose?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.261
I love everything about this job.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.512
Guess I could start with that.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.218
Oh, Chris.

07:56.267 --> 08:00.226
It's a high school seminar, okay,
not a final exam. Relax.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.306
Here.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.772
Are you afraid they're gonna ask you
what it's like to shoot someone?

08:08.697 --> 08:11.439
Uh, n-no. Um...

08:11.491 --> 08:13.277
You think they will?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.193
Well, yeah. I mean, |--| would.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.197
Look, Andy,
you did what you had to do.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.366
All right? You did yourjob.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.001
Most cops, after something like that,

08:25.046 --> 08:26.456
everything starts to fall apart--

08:26.506 --> 08:28.963
theirjob, relationships.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.749
Well, you still got
your head screwed on straight.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.088
All right? You got it together.
You're solid.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.595
Yeah. Solid.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.723
(school bell rings)

08:38.768 --> 08:40.975
(indistinct conversations)

08:41.021 --> 08:43.387
Okay, we all know the rules.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.429
Okay?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.097
The attacker wears a padded suit.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.312
The officer has to fend off the attacker

08:48.361 --> 08:50.147
using his or her baton.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.653
First one to make the other submit wins.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.940
- Thank you. Single malt.
- Oh, oh, oh...

08:54.993 --> 08:57.325
- Ooh. That's new.
- (cheers and applause)

08:57.370 --> 09:01.158
Older than all of you put together.
Value price--$880.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.868
It goes to the copper with the best time.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.168
(Noelle) That'd be me.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.711
Hey, boss, uh... (clears throat)

09:05.754 --> 09:08.336
I know only the unis
are required to retrain,

09:08.381 --> 09:10.758
but I think it's only fair
that we give the detectives

09:10.800 --> 09:12.336
a shot at the booze, too.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.842
That is, uh, if the suits
think they're up to it.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.298
- (singsongy) Mm.
- (Frank) Detectives?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.929
Hold on. You want--You want
to unleash these bad boys?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.260
- Yeah.
- (normal voice) Oh, I love it.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.847
As much as we have, uh, cases to solve

09:22.896 --> 09:24.011
and--and murderers to put in jail,

09:24.064 --> 09:27.306
we believe it's our civic duty
to assist in the reeducation

09:27.358 --> 09:28.689
of our fellow officers.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.975
- (all) Ohh.
- Oh, okay, okay. Bring it.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.395
Okay, uh, Peck, clear the board.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.155
The Ds are in.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.201
This is a high school?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.363
Technically, it's a preparatory academy.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.907
Dude, you went to school in a palace.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.710
(car alarm wailing in distance)

09:49.756 --> 09:51.371
- Oh!
- Sorry.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.800
- Chris!
- Look, again,

09:52.842 --> 09:54.343
I'm really sorry about
the miscommunication.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.376
Are you absolutely sure
we got the dates mixed up?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.930
I'm sure. You were scheduled
for yesterday.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.384
No, we probably should've
just called to double-check.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.639
Well, hey, maybe
we can come by another day.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.175
Well, we have another outreach day
scheduled for next semester.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.062
What? N-Next semester?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.063
- Yes.
- Do you know how far that...

10:09.109 --> 10:11.100
Chris! I'm sorry.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.814
My partner was just
really excited about the talk.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.979
Yeah. A-Again, I'm sorry.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.114
- Thank you.
- W-Wait. What about Saturday?

10:18.159 --> 10:19.239
Maybe they can come--

10:19.285 --> 10:20.695
(whispers)
Let's go. Yeah, let's go.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.076
(normal voice) Thank you.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.534
Unbelievable. I can't believe
we mixed the dates up.

10:24.958 --> 10:25.993
I mean, maybe it's me.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.534
No, it's not you.
It's definitely me. I'm cursed.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.078
Nah, you're just having
a rough week, okay?

10:32.132 --> 10:36.216
Traci said you might be
going up to a cabin tonight.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.547
That might be fun. You can relax,

10:38.596 --> 10:40.097
take it easy, forget all your problems.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.552
Mm. Yeah.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.767
Whoa. Hold up.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.406
(Chris)
Sir, do you need some help?

11:04.455 --> 11:06.446
(panting) I'm okay.
I'm all right.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.991
Okay--No, no. It's okay!
Hey, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait!

11:10.044 --> 11:11.204
Ohh!

11:11.254 --> 11:12.619
He's just--

11:12.672 --> 11:14.287
- What's the problem, sir?
- Dispatch, this is 1505.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.205
Alleyway west of Bloor and Brunswick.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.840
We need an ambulance now.

11:20.847 --> 11:25.466
(Andy) Yeah, we were driving down Brunswick
when it happened. Yeah.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.134
Well, yeah, it's a new booze-can
called Viper.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.305
Apparently they're serving till noon.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.972
Uh, yeah, the victim's name is Jake Plummer.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.482
He's 24 years old,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.267
and the medics say he's in rough shape,

11:36.321 --> 11:37.777
but he's stable enough to talk.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.983
(Chris) Sir? Sir?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.489
Okay, I'd like to inform you

11:41.534 --> 11:42.649
I'm about to take your statement, okay?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.442
(voice straining)
I don't want any trouble.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.575
Okay, good. Neither do we.

11:45.622 --> 11:49.490
So why don't you just do your best
to tell me exactly what happened last night?

11:49.542 --> 11:50.827
Or--Or this morning, I mean.

11:50.877 --> 11:54.540
I don't remember.
| was--| was dancing.

11:54.589 --> 12:00.129
A couple of guys came up.
(groans) They s-suckered me.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.134
Black? White? Skinny? Fat?

12:02.180 --> 12:03.841
Any sort of description on their look?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.972
Sir, can you hear me?

12:06.017 --> 12:07.848
Sorry, Officer. We gotta roll. Now.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.720
Okay. Okay, sir. We're on it.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.057
Hey.

12:17.904 --> 12:18.893
Did you get a statement?

12:18.947 --> 12:20.027
Not much of one.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.483
What did Detective Barber say?

12:21.532 --> 12:24.899
No community service,
so... I guess it's ours.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.693
- Okay.
- (sighs)

12:26.746 --> 12:30.238
(siren wailing)

12:30.291 --> 12:32.452
So...

12:32.502 --> 12:33.958
you guys gonna shut us down?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.085
Still deciding.
It might help if you step up

12:37.924 --> 12:39.880
Kid said he was dancing,
couple of guys jumped him.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.291
It happens.

12:41.344 --> 12:44.711
The right dance moves
with the wrong dude's girl.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.174
Did you see the guys that did this?

12:46.224 --> 12:48.180
Heh.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.682
(clears throat)

12:49.727 --> 12:52.560
Jamaicans. Two brothers.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.561
They're in here all the time.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.847
(Traci) If I give you 5 bucks,

12:55.900 --> 12:57.640
will you taser me
and remind me I'm alive?

12:57.694 --> 12:58.900
You know what I love?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.560
Wrapping up early,
heading back to the barn?

13:00.613 --> 13:03.650
This school.
You see that corner?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.282
I got to second base
with Sabine Mazursky

13:06.327 --> 13:08.568
right there in that corner--
tenth grade school dance.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.077
Do you have any idea how hard it is

13:10.123 --> 13:12.239
to get to second base at a dance?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.203
I'm not really interested
hearing how you groped

13:14.252 --> 13:16.584
some poor girl
during a cheesy power ballad.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.085
Well, that's because you're boring.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.043
Now I'm gonna go flirt
with the Mothers Against Bulimia.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.548
(indistinct conversations)

13:22.593 --> 13:24.094
Ladies.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.594
So I have a couple of questions
about being a cop.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.883
Oh, yeah?

13:31.936 --> 13:34.177
Do they give you a uniform,
or is it like a fast-food joint,

13:34.230 --> 13:35.265
where they make you pay?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.304
(laughs)

13:36.357 --> 13:38.393
ljust admire that you can
make ends meet on that salary.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.899
But don't feel bad--

13:39.944 --> 13:41.445
not even a supermodel
could pull that outfit off.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.476
(laughs)

13:42.530 --> 13:44.316
What about you?
You got one, too?

13:46.200 --> 13:49.533
Come on, girls. Snack time.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.947
MAB love.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.115
I got some digits.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.909
Just like old times.

13:57.962 --> 14:01.125
Yeah, just like old times.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.290
(scoffs

14:03.343 --> 14:04.958
So you questioned the Viper victim?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.171
Yes, sir.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.835
No, no. l-l don't need your notes, Diaz.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.049
Just give me the highlights.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.599
Okay, well, the victim was really out of it.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.222
He was actually beaten pretty bad.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.259
Um, but the doorman lD'd two Jamaicans.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.268
Yeah, brothers. Said they were regulars.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.145
Right. Well, that sounds
like a slam-dunk.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.806
Go down and see if you can't
get a bead on these guys.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.726
All right.
Next heat is Officer Williams

14:22.779 --> 14:25.236
versus Detective Watson!

14:25.281 --> 14:26.566
Ohh.

14:26.616 --> 14:27.901
Why are the detectives
taking part in the retraining?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.781
Ah, Sammy threw down the gauntlet.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.533
He said we didn't have the stones.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.989
I think he's gonna be sorry.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.830
So we should probably head back down

14:36.876 --> 14:38.332
to the Viper Lounge for that follow-up.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.370
Uh, yeah. Can you just
give me a minute, okay?

14:41.422 --> 14:42.662
I'm gonna meet you
in the cruiser in ten.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.549
Yeah, s-sure.
|'||--|'|| see you in ten.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.419
(no audible dialogue)

14:50.807 --> 14:52.172
- What?
- How's Mom?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.556
- Why would you ask that?
- Shut up.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.636
- Steve!
- She's fine.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.970
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, hey.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.851
l-l actually think
he's here to check up on me.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.683
- l--Pfft. You kidding?
- Believe it or not.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.233
You didn't think I'd miss
this Gong Show, did you?

15:01.275 --> 15:03.311
I can't believe
the Ds agreed to be part of it.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.942
Oh, Chris, uh, this is my partner.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.318
Hey, nice to meet you. Derek Bibby.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.400
- Yeah, I've seen you before at The Penny.
- Yeah.

15:08.449 --> 15:12.158
Steve told me about that huge heroin bust
you had last, uh, November.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.034
Oh, yeah.
About 26 million worth,

15:14.080 --> 15:15.866
dozens of guys off the streets.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.247
Brace yourself, Diaz.
You're about to get the full Bibby.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.248
All right, I think
I should get back in there.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.000
Yeah, an ass-kisser's job
is never done.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.002
(gasps) Would you look at that?

15:24.048 --> 15:25.549
(click)
Our time is up.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.207
(Steve and Chris laugh)

15:28.261 --> 15:30.217
Any interest in Vice and Narcotics, Diaz?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.503
Oh, yeah, definitely.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.137
I mean, run on the spin team
catching bad guys?

15:33.182 --> 15:34.171
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.216
I heard you, uh, caught one
down at the Viper this morning.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.384
Yeah, it was totally weird.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.552
We were just rolling along,
and then bam!

15:38.604 --> 15:39.855
There he was, beaten half to death.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.398
- Mm.
- Whoa.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.681
Did he say what happened?

15:42.733 --> 15:45.315
Uh... pshh, danced
with the wrong guy's girl.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.397
Yeah?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.564
(lowers voice) The doorman
gave up two Jamaicans.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.117
We're just about to go check it out.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.870
Hey, I'm not surprised.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.198
Our guys have been watching
that booze-can for weeks.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.113
- Hey, if anything comes up, let us know.
- Yeah.

15:59.167 --> 16:02.284
And next time you're down at The Penny,
come by our table for a pint,

16:02.336 --> 16:04.167
and I'll introduce you
to some of the guys.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.464
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.621
- Okay, man.
- All right.

16:06.674 --> 16:07.663
Well, it was nice meetin' you, Derek.

16:07.717 --> 16:08.752
Yep.

16:10.553 --> 16:11.884
- Attacker, are you ready?
- Yeah.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.430
- Officer, are you ready?
- I'm ready!

16:13.473 --> 16:15.088
Bring it on.
(blows whistle)

16:15.141 --> 16:17.097
Come on, punk.
You want a piece of me?

16:17.143 --> 16:19.429
Come on!

16:19.479 --> 16:20.935
Yah!

16:20.980 --> 16:22.436
Ooh. That hurts.
(thud)

16:22.482 --> 16:24.268
Come on, come on. Let's go!

16:24.317 --> 16:28.435
(both grunting)

16:28.488 --> 16:29.944
Make him pay!

16:29.989 --> 16:31.195
- (cheering)
- Kill him!

16:31.240 --> 16:33.777
- (men shouting)
- Harder!

16:33.826 --> 16:36.408
Come on. Come on.
lthoughtyou”.

16:36.454 --> 16:39.036
- Hey. Hi. Sam!
- Stay with it.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.332
(thudding)

16:41.167 --> 16:42.202
Can I talk to you for a second?

16:42.251 --> 16:43.832
What is it, McNally?
I already told your boyfriend

16:43.878 --> 16:45.539
I'm not gonna hold you back
from the love shack.

16:45.588 --> 16:46.953
He doesn't want to hit traffic.
Come on!

16:47.006 --> 16:48.041
It's not even like that, okay?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.297
(Sam) Come on!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man!

16:50.343 --> 16:51.583
(all shouting at once)

16:51.636 --> 16:52.842
Yeah. Push him! Push him!

16:54.013 --> 16:55.253
- Come on!
- Push him!

16:56.349 --> 16:58.135
I wanna see blood!

16:58.184 --> 16:59.970
- (man) Push him! Push him!
- Aah!

17:00.019 --> 17:01.884
(man) Yeah!

17:01.938 --> 17:03.223
Ah, come on!

17:05.191 --> 17:06.931
Now!

17:06.984 --> 17:08.315
(whistle blows)

17:08.361 --> 17:10.477
- Yaah!
- 50 seconds!

17:10.530 --> 17:11.986
- Yeah!
- Whoo! 50 seconds.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.316
Now that's the time to beat.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.783
It really breaks down
to the three different types...

17:17.828 --> 17:19.784
And what part of criminology
are you interested in?

17:19.830 --> 17:21.957
(gasping) Help!
Somebody, please help!

17:21.999 --> 17:23.455
She's totally fishing out right now,

17:23.501 --> 17:26.413
and I'm pretty sure she's gonna die!
Please!

17:31.842 --> 17:33.343
All right, everybody step back.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.922
- What's her name?
- (girl) Brianna.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.211
Brianna, can you hear me?

17:36.264 --> 17:37.595
What's going on?
Does she normally have seizures?

17:37.640 --> 17:40.177
No. This shouldn't be happening.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.341
We need a medic.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.180
Dispatch, this is 1502.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.185
I need an ambulance at Renfield Prep
immediately.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.641
- Brianna, Brianna...
- We have a student...

17:46.691 --> 17:47.931
- can you open your eyes?
- who's collapsed and seizing.

17:47.984 --> 17:51.147
(police radio chatter)

17:53.030 --> 17:54.361
(Jamaican accent)
Haven't you had enough

17:54.407 --> 17:56.318
of visiting our workplace?

17:56.367 --> 17:57.527
Is your brother here, sir?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.659
Yes, ma'am. Peter!

17:59.704 --> 18:01.444
Babylon a-come visit.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.705
You've been identified as possible
assailants in a vicious beating

18:04.750 --> 18:06.706
that occurred outside the Viper
early this morning.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.741
A beating?

18:07.795 --> 18:09.035
What's this about?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.544
Could you put the wrench down, sir?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.251
Ah, they claim we took part in a beating.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.710
(wrench clanks)

18:13.759 --> 18:15.795
You guys love harassing people.
It's too much.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.301
We're not harassing you, sir.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.382
Well, are you saying that
the doorman at the Viper was lying?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.297
The man cannot think for himself.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.386
Babylon has to pay the boy to face us.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.518
You ever seen this man before?

18:25.563 --> 18:28.350
This dude?
He bought us a round of shots.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.890
Yeah, he the one was
being shadowed by Babylon.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.310
Are you saying that the victim
was being followed by a police officer?

18:34.363 --> 18:37.230
The fella that was after your boy
was definitely a cop.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.491
Yeah, he's been trying to lock us up
for years now--

18:40.536 --> 18:42.743
one boy named Bibby.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.244
B-Bibby?

18:44.290 --> 18:46.451
That's your boy.

18:49.795 --> 18:53.003
So Detective Bibby,
the guy who beat the victim--

18:53.049 --> 18:55.711
I mean, allegedly--
you actually know him?

18:55.760 --> 18:59.298
Sorta. Vice and Narcotics guy.
Works with Steve Peck,

19:00.056 --> 19:01.045
Gail's brother.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.508
Okay.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.932
Look, I should've been honest.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.514
It's just that co-workers
aren't really supposed to date.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.598
It gets messy, and--

19:08.648 --> 19:11.856
- Chris.
- I'm seeing Gail. Yeah.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.266
You're--Oh.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.855
- Anyways...
- Okay.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.236
the point is, is that Bibby
was at the station earlier

19:17.948 --> 19:21.736
asking about Jake, guy in the alley.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.323
He says it was related
to a case he was working.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.613
Yeah, well, those two witnesses
just said that he's the one

19:26.666 --> 19:28.907
that beat the guy up
and put him in the hospital.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.076
Okay, this is a fellow officer
we're talking about.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.916
Yeah, you think
I don't know that? (sighs)

19:34.965 --> 19:37.172
Okay. First rule of police work,

19:37.218 --> 19:39.129
at least according to my father--

19:39.178 --> 19:41.885
you never open your mouth
against another officer,

19:41.931 --> 19:44.217
not unless you know
exactly what the deal is.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.055
(woman) Amphetamines, maybe.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.470
It's hard to tell with these drug cocktails.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.138
Be great to know what we're dealing with.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.226
I'm on it. I'll call you.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.355
All right, stay here.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.689
They say Brianna wasn't high.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.944
The medics say different,

19:58.989 --> 19:59.978
and they're not gonna
know how to help her

20:00.032 --> 20:01.772
unless they know
exactly what she took.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.659
(siren wailing in distance)

20:04.704 --> 20:07.821
(Steve, lowered voice)
I don't know what to say.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.909
(Chris, lowered voice)
We don't know if any of it's true,

20:09.959 --> 20:12.166
but we just thought that...

20:12.211 --> 20:15.169
(sighs)

20:15.214 --> 20:18.081
I thought you'd know what's going on.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.341
Like, we didn't want to just
walk up the line with this,

20:20.386 --> 20:21.421
SO...

20:22.555 --> 20:24.967
I don't know.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.973
I've known Bibby, uh, ten years.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.395
There's gotta be an explanation.
There's gotta be.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.102
He's a good cop.
An impeccable record.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.732
I know.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.606
(sighs)

20:39.655 --> 20:42.943
You know, with that said,
if he did anything illegal--

20:42.992 --> 20:44.402
I mean, hell,
you know my family,

20:44.452 --> 20:45.441
that we do not abide.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.870
No, no. There's no way.

20:46.912 --> 20:50.029
(exhales deeply) Okay.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.449
Thank you, guys,
for bringing this to me.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.458
I'll keep you posted.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.217
Drugs?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.727
You think Brianna was on drugs?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.354
Are you mental?

21:15.399 --> 21:17.185
If we don't know what she took,
the doctors can't help her.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.815
Okay, what is wrong with you?

21:18.861 --> 21:22.228
Your friend is in the hospital
after inhaling amphetamines.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.862
Do you not care?

21:23.908 --> 21:25.398
Ampheta-whatever.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.907
Speed, which can kill you.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.908
Okay, my dad's a lawyer.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.070
This is harassment,

21:31.123 --> 21:34.365
and we have to get back to our studies.
Excuse me.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.377
Well, that was informative.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.417
Actually, it was.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.335
We need to get their schedules.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.298
It's gonna be fine.
Steve's gonna figure it out.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.932
We've just got to wait it out.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.012
Yeah.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.520
Excuse me.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.272
I'm looking
for Officers McNally and Diaz.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.604
Uh, yeah, that's us.
Can we help you?

22:01.654 --> 22:03.064
l'm Lily...

22:04.156 --> 22:05.316
Derek Bibby's sister.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.740
Do you guys have a minute?

22:08.786 --> 22:11.027
Alone?

22:12.289 --> 22:15.031
I shouldn't be here.
This is all my fault.

22:15.084 --> 22:18.247
Okay, just take a deep breath.
Tell us what's going on.

22:18.295 --> 22:22.083
My brother,
he called me this morning.

22:22.132 --> 22:25.090
He said--He said Jake wouldn't
be bothering me anymore.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.126
-Jake?
- The guy that got beaten.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.841
Jake Plummer, right?
Do you know him?

22:29.890 --> 22:31.300
He's my boyfriend.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.012
I mean...

22:34.061 --> 22:35.267
well, he was.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.270
lt's--lt's okay. Take your time.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.772
(sighs) It wasn't working out.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.810
|--| thought we were on the same page,
but then...

22:45.447 --> 22:47.358
one night last week,

22:47.408 --> 22:50.616
I tried to end things with him,

22:50.661 --> 22:52.652
but he got really aggressive.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.161
He hurt you?

22:54.206 --> 22:56.242
(voice breaking) He said he wanted
to be together one last time,

22:56.292 --> 22:58.749
but I didn't want to, so...

22:59.795 --> 23:01.535
I can't even say it.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.588
He assaulted you.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.622
And you told your brother.

23:05.676 --> 23:07.416
Derek just got carried away.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.676
He's my older brother, you know?
He's protective.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.179
Yeah, but if Jake assaulted you,
that's really serious.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.805
- You need to press charges.
- No.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.843
Please, I just want this to go away.

23:16.896 --> 23:20.229
Please? Just let it go.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.100
I can't believe I'm thinking this,

23:24.153 --> 23:25.609
let alone gonna say it out loud.

23:25.654 --> 23:26.860
You think she was lying, too.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.487
I mean, averted eye contact,

23:28.532 --> 23:30.147
she was touching her nose
a bunch of times,

23:30.200 --> 23:32.236
- and she said it hap--
- It happened "one night last week."

23:32.286 --> 23:34.322
- Yeah.
- I mean, it's textbook lying, right?

23:35.289 --> 23:37.996
Look, Andy,
these types of situations...

23:39.752 --> 23:42.243
I know the woman
has to be believed, but...

23:42.296 --> 23:43.536
You think Bibby put her up to it?

23:43.589 --> 23:45.125
He must've, but--

23:46.091 --> 23:47.547
Peck called him.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.754
Yeah. Steve Peck
must've called him, right?

23:49.803 --> 23:52.510
No way.
No way Steve would do that.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.545
Oh, come on, Chris.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.214
They're partners, okay?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.679
You look out for each other.
That's what partners do.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.935
I should never have went to him.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.266
So what do we do now?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.738
(voice straining)
What are you guys doing here?

24:11.784 --> 24:13.775
(Chris) You lied to us.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.864
(sighs) I told you.
l-l don't remember anything.

24:16.914 --> 24:20.122
Concealing evidence,
obstruction of justice,

24:20.167 --> 24:21.452
sexual assault.

24:21.502 --> 24:22.912
What the hell are you talking about?

24:22.962 --> 24:25.123
Your girlfriend Lily--
you remember her?

24:25.172 --> 24:28.039
We just took her statement.
She's saying that you raped her.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.377
(voice breaks) No.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.382
Yeah, that her brother
went after you as retaliation.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.634
Come on. That's insane.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.466
What would you say if I told you

24:34.515 --> 24:36.927
that we have evidence taken
from a rape kit last week?

24:36.976 --> 24:37.965
(under breath) What?

24:41.939 --> 24:42.928
Oh, my God.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.689
You're setting me up.

24:45.734 --> 24:46.940
All right, look,

24:46.986 --> 24:49.648
I swear to God,

24:49.697 --> 24:51.653
I didn't rape anybody.

24:51.699 --> 24:55.191
Lily said this? About me?

24:55.244 --> 24:56.575
You're all in on this.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.780
We're not in on anything.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.946
But you have to tell us
what really happened.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.869
l was on the deck at their house...

25:04.003 --> 25:05.868
having a smoke.
I saw him.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.832
Detective Bibby?

25:07.881 --> 25:10.338
Derek, Lily's brother.
He was in the driveway.

25:10.384 --> 25:11.999
He was pulling stuff out of his car

25:12.052 --> 25:13.883
and shoving it into an old golf bag

25:13.929 --> 25:16.841
that he keeps in the back of his garage.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.267
It was stupid, but...

25:19.309 --> 25:21.095
the next night, I checked it out.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.803
Must've been 50 grand, easy,

25:24.857 --> 25:27.473
stuffed in the golf bag.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.892
It's either stolen or drug money, right?

25:29.945 --> 25:33.233
I thought he wouldn't do anything
if a handful went missing.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.740
Last night, he told me that, uh,

25:36.785 --> 25:38.741
if I talked to anyone,

25:38.787 --> 25:43.076
that if any cop ever found me...

25:48.714 --> 25:50.500
(voice breaks)
he'd come finish the job.

25:54.595 --> 25:57.507
So the kid took money that
Derek Bibby stole from evidence

25:57.556 --> 25:58.671
or off the street,

25:58.724 --> 26:00.385
so Derek beats the living crap out of him,

26:00.434 --> 26:02.925
puts him in the hospital,
then gets his own sister

26:02.978 --> 26:05.640
to tell us some BS story
about getting raped.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.145
Blowing the whistle
on something like this?

26:07.191 --> 26:09.273
I mean, we're not even
fully fledged cops yet.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.398
What, you just want to turn our backs

26:10.444 --> 26:12.400
- and make it all go away?
- Hey, losers.

26:12.446 --> 26:14.027
Heard your high school thing got canceled.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.859
I got papenNork to do.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.990
Whoa. What's her problem?

26:18.035 --> 26:19.115
Meh, who cares?

26:19.161 --> 26:21.527
Hey, listen, you really got stick around

26:21.580 --> 26:24.071
and watch these TOs try to prove
that they've still got it.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.580
It is so precious.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.534
Hey, you okay?

26:28.587 --> 26:32.079
Oh, yeah. I'm just...

26:32.132 --> 26:33.713
I'm just tired.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.251
Oh. I did kinda
keep you up late last night,

26:37.304 --> 26:39.215
although you didn't seem to mind.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.721
(Frank) Peck! Next heat.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.554
(sighs) Okay, I gotta go.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.726
(school bell rings)

26:49.775 --> 26:51.311
(Traci) You know what?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.725
I'm gonna take this one.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.061
All right.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.439
(crying)

26:58.492 --> 27:01.029
Samantha?

27:02.329 --> 27:03.944
What? Are you following me?

27:04.748 --> 27:06.909
Look, I know you're
not like those other girls.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.915
I looked at your schedules,

27:08.961 --> 27:11.498
and Robin and Suzie
are taking bird courses,

27:11.547 --> 27:14.539
while you're loaded up
with biology and chemistry,

27:14.591 --> 27:16.456
- advanced mathematics.
- So?

27:16.510 --> 27:19.673
So you're here on scholarship.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.588
You're notjust a social butterfly
who doesn't care.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.097
Listen, hey.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.099
Hey, come on. Talk to me.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.387
If I'm gonna help your friend,
I need to know what she was on.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.304
If Robin knew I was talking to you--

27:31.358 --> 27:35.476
So what, this Robin chick is making
you guys take amphetamines?

27:39.783 --> 27:41.239
To lose weight

27:41.285 --> 27:43.241
and, you know, for the buzz.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.743
It's totally safe, though,

27:44.788 --> 27:46.949
as long as you're not on any meds
that are contraindicated,

27:46.999 --> 27:49.115
and Bri said she wasn't.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.784
Okay. Well, at least
now I know what she was on.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.915
Can I go?

27:54.965 --> 27:56.000
Yeah.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.501
Samantha.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.719
How long have you been getting it for them?

28:06.768 --> 28:07.803
What?

28:08.979 --> 28:10.935
Those other girls--your friends--

28:10.981 --> 28:13.142
they wouldn't even know how to spell
"contraindicated,"

28:13.192 --> 28:14.773
let alone know what it means.

28:15.611 --> 28:16.942
I don't understand.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.144
I think you do.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.283
Can you do that, $2,500?

28:25.329 --> 28:27.365
That totally works. I can do that.

28:27.414 --> 28:30.201
Ahem. Listen, can it be in installments?

28:30.250 --> 28:31.239
That would be a lot easier for me.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.328
You can stop avoiding me now.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.083
Listen, man, can I call you back?

28:34.129 --> 28:35.790
l--Yeah, I'll call you back.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.546
All right. Okay, bye.
Avoiding you?

28:38.592 --> 28:41.379
Yeah, running away
every time you see me?

28:41.428 --> 28:43.134
Fine, it was what it was.
Whatever.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.340
You know, I'm not gonna overthink it.

28:44.389 --> 28:47.176
- But you're still my training officer, right?
- Yeah.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.308
Okay, that means that I can
come to you with a problem,

28:49.353 --> 28:51.890
no matter what that problem is
or who that problem's with.

28:51.939 --> 28:55.352
Sure. What, you and Callaghan fighting over
who gets top bunk at the cabin?

28:55.400 --> 28:58.733
Oh, that's hilarious.
I'm referring to a case, Sam.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.441
You know what? Screw it.

29:05.661 --> 29:06.650
(groans)

29:06.703 --> 29:07.692
(whistle blows)

29:07.746 --> 29:08.986
- Good job.
- Nicejob, Ruiz.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.155
Time to beat still belongs
to Officer Williams.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.701
All right. Everyone, let's clear
the mat for our next matchup.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.994
Let's see who's up next.

29:17.047 --> 29:21.256
Okay, next heat,
we got Swarek and Callaghan.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.257
(man) Uh-oh.
(whistle blows)

29:23.303 --> 29:24.509
Here we go.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.294
Looks like we're up, buddy.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.088
- Yeah.
- Suit up.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.053
Um...

29:37.442 --> 29:38.557
Girlfight!
(blows whistle)

29:38.610 --> 29:40.441
- (grunts)
- Ohh!

29:40.487 --> 29:43.103
(man) Always keep your eye
on your opponent!

29:43.156 --> 29:45.112
Let's go.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.194
Okay, let's do this.

29:47.995 --> 29:48.984
(man) All right, let's do it.

29:49.037 --> 29:52.245
(indistinct shouting)

29:53.292 --> 29:54.998
- You got it.
- (Gail) Come on!

29:55.043 --> 29:58.331
- You got it.
- (grunting)

30:03.218 --> 30:05.300
(Gail) Come on!

30:06.763 --> 30:09.345
- (Gail) Hit him harder!
- Hey, you like that?

30:09.391 --> 30:11.177
Come on. Come on.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.138
(grunting)

30:19.526 --> 30:20.686
All right.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.644
Come on, come on. Come on!

30:23.697 --> 30:25.858
Get up! Get up!

30:25.907 --> 30:27.693
(man) That's what I'm talking about.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.699
Aah!

30:29.745 --> 30:31.326
- Good stuff.
- Come on, Sam! Get up!

30:31.371 --> 30:34.238
- (growls)
- (man) That's it.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.872
(grunting)

30:35.917 --> 30:37.623
Okay, that's enough!

30:37.669 --> 30:40.206
- Sam!
- That's enough!

30:40.255 --> 30:43.747
- Come on!
- Okay, Swarek! Swarek, enough!

31:00.525 --> 31:01.514
That was crazy.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.354
You see the way Swarek
went after Detective Callaghan?

31:03.403 --> 31:06.019
- What the hell was that about?
- |--| have no idea.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.691
(sighs deeply)

31:07.741 --> 31:10.198
Chris, we have to go
talk to Detective Bibby.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.619
A-And say what?

31:11.661 --> 31:14.323
We can't accuse a senior officer
of stealing evidence.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.909
Yeah, well, we can't
just leave it, either.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.993
I mean, we have to at least
get his side of the story.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.874
I say we take ourselves
out of the equation.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.330
Besides, it's not ourjob anyways.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.870
All right, we don't investigate other cops.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.413
Other cops? What, like Steve Peck,

31:24.466 --> 31:26.502
who just happens to be
related to your girlfriend?

31:26.551 --> 31:28.212
Look, Gail's not my girlfriend.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.671
She--She--

31:30.847 --> 31:33.839
Well, I don't know what she is yet. |--

31:33.892 --> 31:34.972
lju--Yeah, sure.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.394
Maybe--Maybe I don't want
to get involved.

31:36.436 --> 31:39.644
We were the responding officers.
We're already involved.

31:39.689 --> 31:43.898
Then we'll tell Detective Barber
Lily's allegations of assault,

31:43.944 --> 31:45.024
step away from it.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.026
Oh, okay. So you
just want to pass the buck

31:47.072 --> 31:48.403
and let the detectives decide?

31:50.283 --> 31:51.784
Everyone's gonna hate us.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.034
Well, you need to figure out
what's more important--

31:54.079 --> 31:57.196
being liked or telling the truth.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.704
(siren wailing, tires skid)

32:03.964 --> 32:05.170
What are you--You can't do this.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.921
This isn't even a code one emergency.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.047
What about the manual?

32:08.093 --> 32:09.549
Screw the manual.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.884
(Bibby) Oh, hey, Diaz. This your partner?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.219
Let me buy you two a drink.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.759
I don't think so.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.052
We need to talk to you.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.311
Yeah, sure thing.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.017
Why don't we go somewhere
a little more private?

32:24.484 --> 32:25.724
No, this is good.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.233
Out here in the open's good.

32:28.280 --> 32:32.990
My sister told me that she
explained the, uh... situation.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.116
I didn't ask her to come to you, okay?

32:35.162 --> 32:37.073
She did that on her own, so...

32:38.373 --> 32:39.488
I don't believe you.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.617
Are you calling my sister a liar?

32:43.670 --> 32:45.285
No.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.921
Okay.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.798
Watch it, rookie.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.549
We know about Jake stealing the money.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.930
(Chris) We just want to hear
your side of things.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.557
Where'd the money come from?

32:59.603 --> 33:02.140
(laughs) No idea
what you're talking about.

33:02.189 --> 33:04.396
Was it evidence?

33:04.441 --> 33:05.647
(lowered voice) Okay, look,

33:05.692 --> 33:10.152
I think you should be very careful
where you're stepping right now.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.483
(normal voice) You've done
your little bit of police work.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.493
Gold stars all around.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.693
And now it's over.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.862
Time to go after some real bad guys.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.329
We're asking you to tell us what happened.

33:23.793 --> 33:24.828
If you don't,

33:26.004 --> 33:27.835
you're gonna leave us no choice.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.872
In order to maintain
the integrity of the service--

33:29.925 --> 33:30.914
The service?

33:30.967 --> 33:32.423
(smacks lips, chuckles)

33:32.469 --> 33:35.427
What the hell do you know
about "the service"?

33:35.472 --> 33:37.804
You've been a cop for what,
four months?

33:37.849 --> 33:41.012
And you have the balls
to come in here and accuse me?

33:43.146 --> 33:44.306
Okay, you know what?

33:44.356 --> 33:46.267
Just get out of my face.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.487
If you don't come clean,

33:51.530 --> 33:53.987
we're gonna have to take
what we know upstairs.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.524
Do, and I will systematically destroy
your reputations in this service,

33:57.577 --> 33:58.612
as you know I can do.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.448
This is a brotherhood.

34:00.497 --> 34:03.204
You step outside of that,
and you're nothing.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.912
(laughing) And who do you think
they're gonna believe, huh?

34:06.503 --> 34:10.087
Some rookie with a train wreck
for an old man,

34:10.131 --> 34:13.214
some kid who doesn't know
how to wipe his own ass yet,

34:13.260 --> 34:16.844
or a detective
with an impeccable record

34:16.888 --> 34:19.800
who's been on an elite task force
for nine years?

34:19.849 --> 34:21.805
You're nothing! You hear me?

34:21.851 --> 34:25.184
You are nothing but a tube of lipstick
and a badge.

34:25.230 --> 34:28.688
(punchlands)
(coughing)

34:31.361 --> 34:34.319
(Bibby continues coughing)

34:37.117 --> 34:38.732
You two realize what you're saying?

34:38.785 --> 34:40.571
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.576
Why didn't you come to one of us
with this earlier?

34:44.958 --> 34:46.243
They tried.

34:46.293 --> 34:50.081
l was, uh, distracted. I didn't listen.

34:58.388 --> 34:59.423
(Frank) Okay.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.307
We'll start making
the appropriate calls,

35:04.352 --> 35:06.468
have this dealt with,

35:06.521 --> 35:10.105
but I'm not sure I'll be able
to keep you two out of it.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.435
Dismissed.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.567
What are you saying?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.612
I don't know.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.871
Well, you--you obviously do.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.908
I mean, to--to sit here and tell me
that my brother was--

35:29.961 --> 35:31.201
I'm not saying Steve's involved.

35:31.254 --> 35:32.710
But you were implying it.

35:32.756 --> 35:35.668
Look, you--you really think
I wanted to do this?

35:35.717 --> 35:38.959
No, you are the one who reported it.

35:39.012 --> 35:40.718
What was I supposed to do?

35:42.432 --> 35:45.219
l... (sighs) I don't know.

35:45.268 --> 35:46.883
I mean, Steve is my brother.

35:46.936 --> 35:49.928
l have really, uh, no idea what
I'm supposed to say to you.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.442
Hi. Hey.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.728
Hey.

35:57.781 --> 36:00.113
Can I have the same? Thanks.
(clears throat)

36:00.158 --> 36:02.570
So, uh, went back to school today, huh?

36:02.619 --> 36:04.234
(laughs) Yeah.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.743
Hmm.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.656
Did you, uh...
did you learn anything new?

36:08.708 --> 36:12.166
(laughs) Yeah, you know.
Same old, same old.

36:12.212 --> 36:14.168
High school is high school.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.454
Kids will do anything to fit in.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.293
- Yeah.
- Detective Barber,

36:17.342 --> 36:19.333
saw you come in, got you this.

36:19.386 --> 36:20.546
- Lemon drop, right?
- (chuckles)

36:20.595 --> 36:22.051
- Yeah.
- Good man.

36:22.097 --> 36:25.260
Uh, hey, if you or any other Ds
want something to drink later,

36:25.308 --> 36:27.424
uh, just tell the bartender
you're with Epstein.

36:27.477 --> 36:28.842
I got a tab going.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.476
Thanks, Epstein.
I'll be sure to work that.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.511
No problem.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.646
What is going on with those two?

36:33.692 --> 36:36.559
Nothing. No, I mean--
l--nothing that I know about.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.647
I don't know anything.
Why? Are you...

36:38.697 --> 36:42.440
What? Okay. (lowers voice)
You didn't hear it from me, but...

36:42.492 --> 36:45.108
(speaking indistinctly)

36:46.705 --> 36:47.945
Steve.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.574
Diaz giving you the full report?

36:52.627 --> 36:54.492
lA investigation's already under way,

36:54.546 --> 36:56.252
Bibby's suspended without pay till it's over.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.332
That could take months.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.588
What about you?

36:58.633 --> 37:00.544
I had nothing to do with this.

37:02.262 --> 37:05.345
Listen, I told you
to let me handle it, okay?

37:05.390 --> 37:08.348
But, no, Mr. By-the-Book here
just screwed a good man out of his job.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.473
All right. There's peop--

37:09.519 --> 37:11.726
(chair clatters)
And for what?

37:13.148 --> 37:14.729
A little punk-ass thief.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.265
You obviously don't get
what it means to be a real cop.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.934
I'd watch your back, Diaz,

37:19.988 --> 37:21.398
'cause no one else is going to.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.778
You coming?

37:28.705 --> 37:31.287
Don't.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.406
Gail, you coming?

37:33.460 --> 37:35.200
N-No. G--

37:38.506 --> 37:40.007
J‘ You get crushed .l‘

37:40.049 --> 37:42.040
All right, coppers!

37:42.093 --> 37:44.300
Coppers, come on.
Listen up. Listen up.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.506
Could I have your attention, please?

37:46.556 --> 37:50.424
For her superior achievements
of serious ass-kicking,

37:50.477 --> 37:52.513
I would like to present this...

37:52.562 --> 37:55.895
prize bottle
to Officer Noelle Williams.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.771
Whoo!

37:57.817 --> 37:58.977
Yeah!

37:59.027 --> 38:01.018
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.937
So many people to mention.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.572
- So many little, little people.
- (laughs)

38:06.618 --> 38:08.574
(Oliver) Open up that scotch already!

38:08.620 --> 38:10.702
(all cheering)

38:10.747 --> 38:12.703
- Oh, my God.
- (laughter)

38:12.749 --> 38:14.489
You are so lucky
that I wasn't there today.

38:14.542 --> 38:15.531
I would've totally kicked your ass.

38:15.585 --> 38:16.791
Buddy, let me see the war wound.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.293
Oh, I look like
the bride of Frankenstein, pal.

38:19.339 --> 38:21.204
VVeH,okay.
Come here. Give me some love.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.417
- All right. Easy with the ribs, huh?
- I know.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.456
- All right, all right.
- Give me some love.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.046
- Epstein!
- Welcome back, sir.

38:25.094 --> 38:26.925
- Hey, buddy.
- Drinks on me.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.086
- Thank you. Hi.
- Look at you. You look great. Not dead yet?

38:28.139 --> 38:29.925
Hi. Not yet.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.009
Let's get the man some drinks.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.891
Things all right with Gail?

38:35.563 --> 38:36.848
No.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.483
Chris.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.605
So we told the truth.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.696
I'm starting to think I'd rather be liked.

38:49.953 --> 38:51.909
These seats taken?

38:51.955 --> 38:54.287
- No. Please.
- Uh, excuse me. Move over.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.620
- Oh, in your dreams. (laughs)
- Okay.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.160
You got some 'splainin' to do.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.872
I can't believe you're sleeping with Frosty.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.256
What? She guessed.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.171
I'm gonna be right back.

39:08.221 --> 39:09.802
Did she know? You knew.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.884
- I didn't know.
- I didn't know.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.639
Hey, hey.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.180
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.061
It took a lot of guts--

39:23.111 --> 39:27.024
reporting a Vice Squad guy
like that. Yeah.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.026
I'm sorry I didn't believe--

39:29.075 --> 39:31.987
um, I'm sorry
I didn't listen to you before.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.025
Me, too.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.319
No, Andy...

39:38.710 --> 39:39.745
You were right.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.876
Okay? It was what it was.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.166
