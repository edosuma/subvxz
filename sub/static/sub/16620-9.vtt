Happy Valentine's Day,

00:13.216 --> 00:15.149
my little chalky hearts.

00:15.185 --> 00:17.185
- I made you all cards.
- Ooh.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.420
Mine says I get a thousand kisses.

00:19.456 --> 00:20.755
Give me some sugar, Mama!

00:20.790 --> 00:22.034
Mwah, Mwah, Mwah, Mwah... 1,000!

00:22.058 --> 00:23.591
Don't short me, woman!

00:23.627 --> 00:25.660
Louise, read your card now.

00:25.695 --> 00:27.629
I don't really celebrate
Valentine's Day.

00:27.664 --> 00:29.464
It's an invented holiday, you know?

00:29.499 --> 00:30.999
- Read it!
- Fine, fine.

00:31.034 --> 00:34.035
- It's the same as Gene's card.
- Here come your kisses.

00:34.070 --> 00:36.204
- Eh, Gene can have 'em.
- Hell yes!

00:36.239 --> 00:38.539
And here's your card,
my little Valen-Tina.

00:38.575 --> 00:40.608
Oh, no. Oh, wow.

00:40.644 --> 00:42.043
Oh-oh...

00:42.078 --> 00:44.039
- Tina, was that your stomach?
- Yes.

00:44.064 --> 00:45.458
We may have had a
little friendly leftover

00:45.482 --> 00:46.848
chili-eating contest last night.

00:46.883 --> 00:47.883
Which I won.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.217
Tina dominated.

00:49.252 --> 00:51.319
It was like watching
someone barf in reverse.

00:51.354 --> 00:52.820
Well, you look a little pale, Tina.

00:52.856 --> 00:54.233
Are you sure you don't
want to stay home?

00:54.257 --> 00:56.190
No. Anything can happen today,

00:56.226 --> 00:57.892
because today is a day all about love,

00:57.927 --> 00:59.572
and nothing can stop love.

00:59.596 --> 01:00.695
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:00.730 --> 01:02.063
That's right, Tina.

01:02.098 --> 01:03.542
Nothing stopped me
from buying your father

01:03.566 --> 01:04.732
a box of chocolates

01:04.768 --> 01:06.167
from a kid in the parking lot.

01:06.202 --> 01:07.969
Thanks, Lin. I-I got you something

01:08.004 --> 01:09.537
really nice as well.

01:09.572 --> 01:10.732
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:10.757 --> 01:11.839
Can I have it now?

01:11.875 --> 01:13.508
Y-You have to wait until a little later.

01:13.543 --> 01:15.843
- Is that okay?
- Oh, my God! I can't freakin' wait!

01:15.879 --> 01:18.346
Oops, oops, oops, this opened. Mmm...

01:18.381 --> 01:19.647
Dark chocolate!

01:19.683 --> 01:22.357
So dry, so bitter. Why?!

01:22.382 --> 01:24.085
Num num num...

01:24.120 --> 01:26.854
Walnuts? Just be normal, damn it!

01:26.890 --> 01:28.589
Step right up

01:28.625 --> 01:30.558
and buy one of my Mini Flower Love Weeds

01:30.593 --> 01:32.160
for your valentine.

01:32.195 --> 01:34.162
What flower what weeds?

01:34.197 --> 01:36.898
A weed is just the right plant
growing in the wrong place.

01:36.933 --> 01:39.367
I'm selling bouquets for
a buck each... who's in?

01:39.402 --> 01:41.002
- Hey, Tina.
- Hey, Jimmy Jr.

01:41.037 --> 01:42.503
Do you have any Valentine's plans?

01:42.539 --> 01:44.572
Are you free today at lunch?

01:44.607 --> 01:46.040
Valentine's Day plans?

01:46.076 --> 01:48.576
Today? Lunch? Me? With you?

01:49.979 --> 01:51.713
Uh, yeah.

01:51.748 --> 01:52.780
No, I don't.

01:52.816 --> 01:54.182
Cool. So will you meet me

01:54.217 --> 01:55.516
in the gymnasium at lunch?

01:55.562 --> 01:57.018
- I love it already.
- Great.

01:57.053 --> 01:58.686
What you're wearing is fine.

01:58.722 --> 02:00.555
Unless you brought something else.

02:00.590 --> 02:02.023
- You probably didn't.
- Wait, what?

02:02.058 --> 02:03.458
Did you bring... ? Forget it.

02:03.493 --> 02:05.927
Just, yeah. Don't be
late, and brush your teeth.

02:07.797 --> 02:09.297
Oh, my stomach.

02:09.332 --> 02:11.733
Ugh, chili poops! Got
to get to the bathroom.

02:11.768 --> 02:13.234
Zeke is literally selling weeds,

02:13.269 --> 02:15.937
and people are buying them. Gah!

02:15.972 --> 02:17.405
This is the dumbest holiday ever.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.273
Yeah, love can really make people do

02:19.309 --> 02:21.664
some wacky things, huh?

02:21.689 --> 02:23.578
Hey, are you gonna be at lunch today?

02:23.613 --> 02:25.880
Well, I made a reservation... why?

02:25.915 --> 02:28.249
Oh, I don't know. Just checking.

02:28.284 --> 02:30.318
Check. Just pretending to check a box.

02:30.353 --> 02:32.153
Anyway, I should be going.

02:32.188 --> 02:33.788
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:33.823 --> 02:36.591
Poor kid picked up the wrong inhaler.

02:38.862 --> 02:40.842
So what'd you get Linda
for Valentine's Day, Bob?

02:40.867 --> 02:43.093
Well, she's always wanted me to learn
how to ballroom dance,

02:43.118 --> 02:46.148
I guess in case we ever go back in time,

02:46.173 --> 02:48.359
so, I wanted to take some classes.

02:48.384 --> 02:50.242
Wow. So how many classes have you had?

02:50.267 --> 02:52.167
Not quite enough, because none.

02:52.219 --> 02:54.385
I've had none. I didn't sign up for any.

02:54.421 --> 02:56.154
It's Valentine's Day.
What are you gonna do?

02:56.189 --> 02:58.601
Teddy, take it easy. I was
gonna try and learn how to dance

02:58.625 --> 02:59.991
on the Internet really quick.

03:00.026 --> 03:01.860
Bob, you've got time for a real class.

03:01.895 --> 03:04.729
My Zumba is at a studio, and
they teach ballroom there.

03:04.764 --> 03:07.098
You take one lesson, and
you'll be like Gene Kelly,

03:07.133 --> 03:08.933
if Gene Kelly only had one dance lesson.

03:08.969 --> 03:10.101
That's a good idea, Teddy.

03:10.136 --> 03:12.523
- I-I should go. Where is it?
- I'll go with you.

03:12.548 --> 03:14.549
I'm back with the pickles.

03:14.574 --> 03:15.885
I'm gonna stare cutting
them into hearts.

03:15.909 --> 03:17.119
Lin, do you think you can maybe

03:17.143 --> 03:18.576
handle the lunch rush by yourself?

03:18.612 --> 03:19.911
What? Why?

03:19.946 --> 03:22.247
I've got to go on an errand,

03:22.282 --> 03:25.283
and it may or not have
to do with your gift.

03:25.318 --> 03:27.752
So romantic.

03:27.787 --> 03:29.520
Bob, tell me what it is.

03:29.556 --> 03:30.700
- Linda, I'm not...
- No, I don't want to know.

03:30.724 --> 03:31.767
I don't want to know.
Forget it, forget it.

03:31.791 --> 03:33.291
Get out before I guess it.

03:33.326 --> 03:35.760
May I please have a
hall pass, Ms. Twitchell?

03:35.795 --> 03:37.295
I'm having boy troubles.

03:37.330 --> 03:38.730
I'm sure you understand,

03:38.765 --> 03:40.617
but it's also not what you think.

03:40.642 --> 03:44.135
Hildy? It's Gene. Are you in there?

03:44.170 --> 03:45.737
It's Wednesday. I'm here for my

03:45.772 --> 03:47.890
day-old Taco Tuesday tacos.

03:47.915 --> 03:51.142
Hello? What do we have here?

03:51.177 --> 03:52.477
- Hey!
- Aah!

03:52.512 --> 03:53.651
You're not Hildy.

03:53.676 --> 03:56.725
_

03:58.652 --> 04:00.618
Whoa...

04:00.654 --> 04:02.787
Oh.

04:02.822 --> 04:04.088
Hello.

04:05.458 --> 04:06.791
Oh, you're yelling at me.

04:06.826 --> 04:08.593
Uh, I'll leave. Bye.

04:08.628 --> 04:10.161
I like you!

04:10.835 --> 04:12.630
Sorry, ballroom's been canceled.

04:12.666 --> 04:14.732
The teacher just waltzed
right out of here.

04:14.768 --> 04:17.168
Get it? I'm kidding, she died.

04:17.202 --> 04:21.101
- Crap. Okay, Teddy, let's go, we tried.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.664
They offer other classes here, you know.

04:22.689 --> 04:25.020
Check a look. Women love
any kind of dancing, Bob.

04:25.045 --> 04:26.411
It demonstrates your virility

04:26.446 --> 04:27.779
and your sexual style.

04:27.814 --> 04:29.814
- My sexual style?
- Yeah. Tell him.

04:29.849 --> 04:31.849
- Yeah, it's true.
- Uh, okay, fine.

04:31.885 --> 04:34.152
I-I-I'll just take
whatever class starts next.

04:34.187 --> 04:36.171
We'll take whatever class starts next.

04:36.196 --> 04:37.514
- Really?
- You think I'm not gonna

04:37.539 --> 04:38.578
take this class with you?

04:38.603 --> 04:41.279
I did think that. I
guess that was crazy.

04:45.865 --> 04:47.665
Oh, shell yes!

04:47.701 --> 04:52.468
How does a mermaid even
ride one of those... ?

04:52.493 --> 04:55.707
Can I get one bouquet of Mini
Flower Love Weeds, please?

04:55.742 --> 04:57.141
That'll be one dollar, Romeo.

04:57.177 --> 04:58.443
What are you doing, Rudy?

04:58.478 --> 05:00.054
Why are you buying Love Weeds?

05:00.079 --> 05:01.507
Who's the lucky ducky?

05:01.532 --> 05:03.359
Let's just say we've
been friends for a while,

05:03.383 --> 05:05.483
but it's time to take
it to the next level.

05:05.518 --> 05:08.519
- You mean level two?
- Oh, yeah.

05:08.555 --> 05:10.955
Oh, my God, Rudy's
gonna give me Love Weeds

05:10.991 --> 05:12.546
for Valentine's Day.

05:12.891 --> 05:15.570
Rudy like-likes me. Sick!

05:18.313 --> 05:20.515
Oh, why would Rudy do
something like this?

05:20.540 --> 05:22.639
What kind of idiot like-likes someone?

05:22.675 --> 05:24.320
- Louise?
- Aah! Tina?

05:24.345 --> 05:26.679
Yeah, I-I've been in here all morning.

05:26.704 --> 05:29.171
- Oh, hi. Chili, huh?
- Yeah.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.181
Of all the days to get
diarrhea of the butt.

05:31.217 --> 05:33.250
Jimmy Jr. planned
something special for me.

05:33.285 --> 05:34.351
Wait, Rudy likes you?

05:34.386 --> 05:36.234
Yeah, unfortunately.

05:36.259 --> 05:38.255
- Which sized Rudy?
- Regular.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.023
Oh. Don't you like Rudy?

05:40.059 --> 05:41.325
No, not like that.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.327
We have a good thing
going the way it is.

05:43.362 --> 05:44.795
We're buddies.

05:44.830 --> 05:46.630
There's gotta be a way I can stop this.

05:46.665 --> 05:48.365
Sorry, sister, I hate to tell you this,

05:48.400 --> 05:50.167
but nothing, and I mean nothing,

05:50.202 --> 05:52.302
can stop love. Except diarrhea.

05:52.338 --> 05:53.804
No! I'm gonna beat this thing.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.540
I mean, I get why he's
on the Louise train.

05:56.575 --> 05:58.041
I just have to find a way to get him

05:58.077 --> 06:00.544
to jump off at the
next stop. I gotta go.

06:00.579 --> 06:02.157
Holler if you need TP
or newspaper or anything.

06:02.181 --> 06:04.781
Okay, Actually, I need
another roll of TP.

06:04.984 --> 06:07.328
Louise? I'll make it work.

06:07.329 --> 06:08.310
_

06:08.335 --> 06:10.854
Welcome to hip-hop
dance class with Shelly.

06:10.890 --> 06:12.322
See the way I'm walking,

06:12.358 --> 06:13.991
with one of my arms
lower than the other,

06:14.026 --> 06:15.343
and my foot dragging?

06:15.368 --> 06:16.994
Well, that's hip-hop.

06:17.029 --> 06:19.179
Oh, my God. Oh, that's hip-hop.

06:19.204 --> 06:21.064
The other day, I was
in the grocery store

06:21.100 --> 06:23.033
buying some light-bulbs and ice cream,

06:23.068 --> 06:26.069
and I could tell the cashier
didn't like my baggy pants.

06:26.105 --> 06:29.473
But I didn't care,
because that's hip-hop.

06:29.508 --> 06:31.642
- Teddy, we need to get out of here.
- Are you kidding me?

06:31.677 --> 06:33.488
This is the coolest thing
I've ever been a part of.

06:33.512 --> 06:35.812
Oh, I see we have some
new students in class.

06:35.848 --> 06:36.671
'Sup?

06:36.696 --> 06:38.046
'Sup, ma'am?

06:38.071 --> 06:39.383
I bet you normally

06:39.418 --> 06:40.817
sit on a chair the front way,

06:40.853 --> 06:42.007
like everyone else.

06:42.032 --> 06:43.328
But not in this class.

06:43.353 --> 06:45.856
In this class you turn that chair around

06:45.891 --> 06:47.190
and sit on it backwards.

06:47.226 --> 06:48.539
You know why?

06:48.564 --> 06:50.005
- Because that's hip...
- Because that's hip-hop.

06:50.029 --> 06:51.495
Right, right. I-I got it.

06:51.530 --> 06:52.729
Nice, Bob.

06:52.765 --> 06:54.209
Okay, everybody,

06:54.233 --> 06:56.011
There's gonna be some
profanity coming at you,

06:56.035 --> 06:59.102
so cover your ears if you
can't handle the "B" word.

06:59.765 --> 07:01.905
Oh, hey, Ms. Selbo.

07:01.941 --> 07:03.707
What are you doing here on a school day?

07:03.742 --> 07:05.273
I took a personal day.

07:05.298 --> 07:08.045
My boyfriend Martin broke up with me.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.279
No!

07:09.315 --> 07:11.949
Yeah. I was totally blindsided.

07:11.984 --> 07:13.383
That jerk.

07:13.419 --> 07:15.786
He's across the street at Jimmy Pesto's.

07:15.821 --> 07:17.688
There's nothing good about that place.

07:17.723 --> 07:20.023
I like the jalapeño poppers.

07:20.059 --> 07:22.025
Okay, that's one good
thing about that place.

07:22.061 --> 07:23.906
And their Pesto Coladas. Two things.

07:27.842 --> 07:29.093
Hey...

07:29.117 --> 07:31.117
_

07:31.136 --> 07:33.203
Oh, uh, hi. I only have five minutes

07:33.238 --> 07:35.639
before recess is over,
but, uh, I was wondering

07:35.674 --> 07:37.265
if you could maybe slap my wrist again.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.753
I think I licked all the chocolate off

07:38.777 --> 07:39.843
the last slap mark.

07:39.867 --> 07:43.632
_

07:43.657 --> 07:45.259
I don't know what you're saying,

07:45.284 --> 07:46.616
but it makes me feel like I felt

07:46.652 --> 07:48.085
the time I sat on the dryer.

07:48.187 --> 07:50.718
You want me to stir, or is this a gift?

07:50.743 --> 07:52.122
Si, stir.

07:52.157 --> 07:54.424
- I'm Gene, by the way.
- Isabella.

07:54.460 --> 07:56.259
So I guess Hildy's out sick today?

07:56.295 --> 07:57.594
Sick. Si, Si.

07:57.629 --> 07:59.062
So if that's our lunch,

07:59.098 --> 08:00.163
is this our dessert?

08:00.199 --> 08:01.965
No, no, no, mi gattino.

08:02.001 --> 08:04.468
This is for mi Amor, Francesco.

08:04.503 --> 08:06.140
Oh, boyfriend.

08:06.165 --> 08:07.771
Si, boyfriend.

08:07.806 --> 08:09.339
Hmm. What grade is he in?

08:09.375 --> 08:10.707
He sounds ugly.

08:12.423 --> 08:14.390
Time to Un-attract.

08:14.415 --> 08:16.246
- Oh, hey, buddy.
- Hey, Louise.

08:16.281 --> 08:17.848
Quick question. Do you like boogers?

08:17.883 --> 08:19.265
Um, what?

08:19.290 --> 08:20.962
I've been eating my boogs all morning,

08:20.986 --> 08:22.519
and I love 'em.

08:22.554 --> 08:24.588
I was wondering if anyone
else was into boogers.

08:24.623 --> 08:26.690
Oh, okay, no.

08:26.725 --> 08:27.791
Want to try one of mine?

08:27.826 --> 08:29.026
Maybe mine are extra good.

08:29.061 --> 08:30.994
- I don't know, huh.
- That's pretty gross.

08:31.030 --> 08:33.630
So what can I get you? You
want a wet one, a dry one?

08:33.664 --> 08:36.804
- Uh, I'm feeling sick.
- Great!

08:36.828 --> 08:38.301
But you know what, I gotta say,

08:38.337 --> 08:39.717
the whites of your eyes are bright,

08:39.743 --> 08:41.554
your fingernails are strong and healthy.

08:41.578 --> 08:44.107
Maybe there's something to
this eating boogers thing.

08:44.143 --> 08:45.453
I mean, hey, whatever you're doing,

08:45.477 --> 08:46.510
keep it up, sister.

08:46.545 --> 08:47.644
Bye. See you at lunch.

08:47.679 --> 08:49.579
You've gotta be kidding me.

08:52.051 --> 08:54.384
Okay, doing good.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.887
Feeling confident, feeling cool.

08:56.922 --> 08:58.355
Starting to strut.

08:58.390 --> 09:00.624
Oh, God! The strut was too much.

09:00.659 --> 09:02.025
No strutting. No strutting.

09:03.729 --> 09:06.229
There she is.

09:06.265 --> 09:08.231
J-Jimmy Jr. What's going on?

09:08.267 --> 09:10.467
Remember that anti-drug
group that came last week

09:10.502 --> 09:12.202
to do a presentation?

09:12.237 --> 09:13.537
You mean Thrills, Not Pills?

09:13.572 --> 09:15.072
Yeah. They did a number on me.

09:15.107 --> 09:17.574
I couldn't believe the
national statistics.

09:17.609 --> 09:19.543
Well, they left behind all their props,

09:19.578 --> 09:21.344
including... this trampoline.

09:21.380 --> 09:24.481
So everyone is here to
watch us do a sky kiss!

09:24.516 --> 09:25.649
Yeah!

09:25.684 --> 09:27.984
- A what?
- A sky kiss, Tina.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.986
We bounce up and down like this

09:30.022 --> 09:33.056
until we get high
enough, and then we kiss.

09:33.092 --> 09:35.764
You want me to bounce
on that trampoline?

09:35.789 --> 09:36.827
Uh-huh.

09:36.862 --> 09:39.162
It's romantic and dangerous,

09:39.198 --> 09:40.497
like a candle.

09:40.532 --> 09:42.766
I...

09:42.801 --> 09:43.834
Uh, I'll be right back.

09:43.869 --> 09:45.402
Feelings are scary, girl!

09:46.390 --> 09:47.737
Nah, nah.

09:47.773 --> 09:49.539
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

09:49.575 --> 09:52.008
Uh, why are... why are you saying that?

09:52.044 --> 09:54.077
- Nah, nah, nah.
- Is there a problem?

09:54.113 --> 09:55.779
I'm-I'm just trying to tie my shoe.

09:55.814 --> 09:57.280
That's not hip-hop. Peep my feets.

09:57.316 --> 10:00.183
- Your shoes are untied.
- That's hip-hop.

10:00.219 --> 10:01.518
Okay, good to know.

10:01.553 --> 10:03.420
- People call me Flips Whitefudge.
- They do?

10:03.455 --> 10:05.689
You think you can just
come up in my mom's class

10:05.724 --> 10:06.857
and learn how to dance?

10:06.892 --> 10:08.091
Wait, Shelly is your mom?

10:08.127 --> 10:10.060
She's your mom! No, she's my mom.

10:10.095 --> 10:12.229
Look, I-I'm just trying
to learn how to dance

10:12.264 --> 10:14.203
as a gift for my wife
for Valentine's Day.

10:14.228 --> 10:15.966
Well, that's actually incredibly sweet!

10:16.001 --> 10:17.367
Um, thank you.

10:17.402 --> 10:18.713
You're welcome, but
if you want to hip-hop,

10:18.737 --> 10:19.970
you gotta prove yourself.

10:20.005 --> 10:21.304
We're gonna hip-hop dance battle.

10:21.340 --> 10:22.539
Is everything all right here?

10:22.574 --> 10:24.441
Uh, sort of. Your son,

10:24.476 --> 10:26.776
Flips Whitefudge, is
trying to battle us.

10:26.812 --> 10:29.946
Uh, Flips? We've talked about this.

10:29.982 --> 10:31.581
No, Ma. This is what you taught me.

10:31.617 --> 10:33.383
If it's not hip-hop,
then it's not hip-hop.

10:33.418 --> 10:35.719
If they want to learn from
you, they got to battle me.

10:35.754 --> 10:38.555
Well, he really won't give
this up unless you battle him.

10:38.590 --> 10:41.091
So, I guess you guys are battlin'.

10:41.126 --> 10:42.759
We can do this. We can beat this guy.

10:42.794 --> 10:44.327
Teddy, we don't know any hip-hop.

10:44.363 --> 10:46.329
Yes, we do. It's inside us.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.898
- Now untie your shoes, "B" word.
- Let's do this.

10:48.923 --> 10:50.178
Right after we stretch out.

10:51.703 --> 10:52.903
Why did I come here?

10:53.882 --> 10:55.338
Oh, God. Oh, God.

10:55.374 --> 10:57.107
It's happening. It's going down.

10:57.142 --> 10:59.075
- I'm gonna hide behind this napkin.
- Hey, Louise.

10:59.111 --> 11:00.855
I have something very
important to ask you...

11:00.878 --> 11:02.523
- Rudy, let me stop you right there.
- I was just gonna...

11:02.548 --> 11:03.813
Look. No, I get it.

11:03.849 --> 11:05.615
We live in a commercial culture.

11:05.651 --> 11:07.851
Love is in the movies.
It's in all the songs.

11:07.886 --> 11:09.853
But we don't have to
be pawns in the game.

11:09.888 --> 11:10.999
- Yeah. I...
- We're just friends.

11:11.023 --> 11:12.355
Louise, I wanted to ask you

11:12.391 --> 11:14.090
to give this Love Weed and this card

11:14.126 --> 11:16.162
to Chloe Barbash for me, in Science.

11:16.187 --> 11:17.027
What?

11:17.062 --> 11:18.528
You have science with Chloe Barbash

11:18.564 --> 11:20.281
- after lunch, right?
- I...

11:20.306 --> 11:21.765
Y-Yeah. I think so.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.033
Okay, good, 'cause she's

11:23.068 --> 11:25.101
the most beautiful girl in the world.

11:25.137 --> 11:27.637
She smells like someone's
baking a cake in her hair.

11:27.673 --> 11:28.929
It's her shampoo.

11:28.954 --> 11:31.508
I heard she uses the
whole bottle every time.

11:31.543 --> 11:32.709
She takes my breath away.

11:32.744 --> 11:34.444
I mean, everything does, but still.

11:34.479 --> 11:36.171
Thanks, Louise. You're the coolest.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.506
Great. So Rudy likes Chloe Barbash.

11:39.531 --> 11:41.051
And not... me.

11:41.312 --> 11:42.319
What a relief.

11:42.354 --> 11:43.620
Oh, hey, Louise!

11:43.655 --> 11:45.222
Try not to get any boogers on the card.

11:47.211 --> 11:48.936
Chloe freakin' Barbash?

11:48.961 --> 11:51.436
Rudy might as well like
a box of packing peanuts.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.820
She's all fluff.
There's nothing in there.

11:53.845 --> 11:55.774
Wow, Louise, you seem a 
little worked up about this.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.084
Do I?

11:57.109 --> 11:59.202
I agree with Louise. By the way,

11:59.227 --> 12:01.062
this is from my house
and I brought it here,

12:01.087 --> 12:02.851
not the other way around. Got it?

12:04.566 --> 12:07.359
Mm. The chocolate needs more,

12:07.384 --> 12:09.296
how you say, bitter?

12:09.321 --> 12:11.703
I think the word you're
looking for is butter.

12:11.758 --> 12:14.226
I have some in my locker
if we can't find any here.

12:14.261 --> 12:15.727
Oh, no, no, no. Not butter.

12:15.762 --> 12:18.330
Bitter. We make dark chocolate.

12:18.365 --> 12:19.564
Dark chocolate?

12:19.600 --> 12:20.899
No! Don't do it!

12:20.934 --> 12:22.167
It is like love.

12:22.202 --> 12:24.002
Sweet, bitter.

12:24.037 --> 12:25.570
Happy, sad.

12:25.606 --> 12:28.240
Don't use your sensual
Italian wisdom on me!

12:28.275 --> 12:30.109
It's not fair, but keep talking!

12:31.545 --> 12:32.877
Yo, yo. It's battle time.

12:32.913 --> 12:34.012
Drop that beat, Ma.

12:35.382 --> 12:36.548
You scared, mustache?

12:36.583 --> 12:39.218
Uh, yes.

12:40.787 --> 12:43.221
Is... this it? I can't
tell if he's started yet.

12:43.257 --> 12:44.956
I'm gonna Janet Jackson this.

12:44.992 --> 12:46.391
- Ow!
- Ooh. Ah!

12:46.426 --> 12:48.393
Oh, Flips. Sweetie, are you okay?

12:48.428 --> 12:50.295
I got my lips stuck in my braces.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.442
Well, I'm injured now, so I
guess you guys won the battle.

12:52.466 --> 12:54.209
Um, okay.

12:54.234 --> 12:56.482
Ma, it's time to teach these LL Fool Js

12:56.507 --> 12:57.802
how to dance.

12:57.838 --> 12:59.616
Hey, Chloe. These are
from Regular Sized Rudy.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.473
He wanted me to give them to you.

13:01.508 --> 13:03.708
- And the card.
- Great. Thanks.

13:03.744 --> 13:05.043
That's it?

13:05.078 --> 13:07.112
Don't you want to read the card?

13:07.147 --> 13:08.546
Mm. Maybe later.

13:08.582 --> 13:11.483
Oh... That is a lot of shampoo.

13:11.518 --> 13:13.785
Thanks. I use it when I take a shower.

13:13.820 --> 13:16.896
Okay, class. Today we'll
be dissecting a banana.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.054
We only have two, so
get into groups of 13.

13:20.079 --> 13:22.779
That was a delicious burger, Linda.

13:22.804 --> 13:25.230
I have to admit, it
really lifted my spirits.

13:25.265 --> 13:28.566
Great. I'm sure you'll start
feeling better in a couple days.

13:28.602 --> 13:30.168
After all, you just broke up.

13:30.203 --> 13:32.304
Oh, no. We broke up a year ago.

13:32.339 --> 13:33.972
Wait, I thought you broke up today.

13:34.007 --> 13:36.308
I thought you came
here from Jimmy Pesto's.

13:36.343 --> 13:38.410
No, no, no. He's at Jimmy Pesto's.

13:38.445 --> 13:40.512
I just followed him, and
I've been watching him

13:40.547 --> 13:42.013
from your restaurant.

13:42.049 --> 13:44.516
That's... not alarming.

13:44.551 --> 13:46.851
I just haven't been
myself since the breakup.

13:46.887 --> 13:50.088
I mean, it's not like me to
sleep outside someone's house

13:50.123 --> 13:53.325
or steal someone's dog
or pee on someone's mail

13:53.360 --> 13:55.662
and then watch them open it and laugh

13:55.695 --> 13:58.196
when they eat a breakfast
sandwich with that same hand.

13:58.231 --> 14:01.333
No! You wouldn't do those things.

14:01.368 --> 14:03.868
But I did. I did those things.

14:03.904 --> 14:05.248
Look, it sounds

14:05.273 --> 14:07.205
like you just need some closure.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.875
And, uh, maybe some professional help.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.821
But I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna go over there

14:11.845 --> 14:13.144
and bring Martin in here.

14:13.180 --> 14:14.357
You're never gonna get over this

14:14.381 --> 14:16.193
unless you deal
with it face-to-face.

14:16.218 --> 14:19.284
- You can't stab him, though, okay?
- You're so sweet to me.

14:19.319 --> 14:22.454
Wait, I can or I can't?
You probably said "can't."

14:22.489 --> 14:24.456
Ugh, what's taking so long?

14:24.491 --> 14:26.791
What's Tina even doing?
Combing her boobs?

14:30.530 --> 14:31.563
Hello.

14:31.598 --> 14:32.797
Tina! You're here!

14:32.833 --> 14:34.366
Let's do this!

14:34.401 --> 14:36.725
Jimmy Jr., I walked
slowly and carefully back

14:36.750 --> 14:39.571
to tell you that I can't
do the sky kiss with you.

14:39.606 --> 14:42.374
My heart says yes, but my butt says no.

14:42.409 --> 14:43.875
Wait, what are you saying, Tina?

14:43.910 --> 14:45.421
Can I tell you down
here? It'd be a little bit

14:45.445 --> 14:47.245
- better for me.
- No, just shout it out.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.414
I'm on a trampoline.
I'm not coming down.

14:49.449 --> 14:51.683
I have diarrhea, okay?
I have horrible diarrhea!

14:51.718 --> 14:53.718
If I jump up and down, I could explode!

14:53.754 --> 14:55.253
- Gross.
- Oh.

14:55.288 --> 14:57.422
- Girls get diarrhea?
- Big time.

14:57.457 --> 14:58.990
No. They don't, actually. They don't.

14:59.025 --> 15:01.192
I used to think nothing can stop love.

15:01.228 --> 15:04.601
But it looks like I was
wrong. I'm sorry, Jimmy Jr.

15:10.804 --> 15:12.014
Do... So you gave it to her, right?

15:12.038 --> 15:13.271
Yeah, I gave it to her.

15:13.306 --> 15:14.506
- But listen...
- Now we begin

15:14.541 --> 15:17.100
Kiss Chloe Barbash.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.258
Wait, what?

15:18.293 --> 15:19.692
The card on the bouquet said

15:19.728 --> 15:21.562
to meet me on the playground
at the end of the day

15:21.587 --> 15:23.250
so I can give Chloe a Valentine's kiss.

15:23.275 --> 15:24.546
My first kiss.

15:24.571 --> 15:26.671
My first non-parents-
and-grandmother kiss.

15:26.696 --> 15:28.937
Oh, boy. Rudy,

15:28.962 --> 15:31.382
do you really think she likes you?

15:31.407 --> 15:33.328
Like, like-likes you?

15:33.353 --> 15:36.101
Um, yeah, she made it
pretty clear, Louise.

15:36.126 --> 15:38.460
She passes me notes
in class all the time.

15:38.485 --> 15:41.257
Check it out. "Dear Cutie-Bear.

15:41.282 --> 15:43.695
_

15:43.720 --> 15:46.312
- _
- Oh.

15:46.337 --> 15:48.371
Yeah. Pretty hot stuff, huh?

15:48.396 --> 15:50.750
Well, I'm gonna go look in
the mirror so I can remember

15:50.775 --> 15:53.390
what I looked like
before everything changed.

15:53.469 --> 15:56.031
Oh, no. If I don't do
something about this,

15:56.056 --> 15:59.148
Regular Sized Rudy is
gettin' big time screwdy.

15:59.173 --> 16:00.835
Don't say screwdy.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.838
Sorry. I brought these coffee
filters from home, by the way.

16:02.863 --> 16:04.648
Not the other way around.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.889
The jig is up. I know
what you're doing, Chloe.

16:08.914 --> 16:10.814
What are you talking about, Louise?

16:10.849 --> 16:13.250
I know that you've been acting
flirty with Regular Sized Rudy

16:13.285 --> 16:15.151
just to get his quiz answers.

16:15.187 --> 16:17.721
Rudy's a big boy. If he feels
like giving me the answers,

16:17.756 --> 16:19.089
that's up to him.

16:19.124 --> 16:21.324
Okay, listen, he's not a "big boy."

16:21.360 --> 16:22.859
He's regular-sized.

16:22.895 --> 16:25.362
And that kid has more heart
in his regular-sized body

16:25.397 --> 16:27.898
than anyone else in this
school. And you're... you...

16:27.933 --> 16:29.959
Oh, my God. You're freaking out.

16:29.984 --> 16:31.935
Yes! Because Rudy wants
to meet you after school

16:31.970 --> 16:34.170
to give you his first
kiss. And you know what?

16:34.206 --> 16:36.039
You're gonna give him his first kiss.

16:36.074 --> 16:38.217
Why would I do that? Because
he gave me some weeds?

16:38.242 --> 16:39.209
Yes!

16:39.244 --> 16:40.744
Louise, he isn't the only boy

16:40.779 --> 16:43.213
that gave me weeds
today. This is from Kevin.

16:43.248 --> 16:46.506
Kevin Ishihara. He
juggled three Beanie Babies

16:46.531 --> 16:48.351
at the last talent show. Three.

16:48.387 --> 16:50.520
Rudy is like the slowest
runner in our grade.

16:50.555 --> 16:52.522
He's the slowest runner in the world!

16:52.557 --> 16:55.859
Everybody knows that! He
shouldn't be running at all!

16:55.894 --> 16:56.927
That's what I'm saying!

16:56.962 --> 16:59.729
He starts running, and after two paces,

16:59.765 --> 17:01.731
he has to stop to breathe.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.533
I know. It's so embarrassing.

17:03.568 --> 17:05.702
Yeah. And you're gonna suck it up!

17:05.737 --> 17:07.604
You're gonna kiss that slow man!

17:07.638 --> 17:10.307
You're gonna kiss slow,
Regular Sized Rudy,

17:10.342 --> 17:12.909
or you're gonna be eating
that Love Weed through a straw.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.310
Get off of me!

17:14.346 --> 17:16.313
- No! Oh, you...
- Stop it!

17:20.421 --> 17:23.992
Stop! I am not kissing him, Louise.

17:24.017 --> 17:25.085
Bye!

17:25.375 --> 17:27.867
Damn it. She smells so good.

17:28.414 --> 17:29.759
Perfetto.

17:30.171 --> 17:32.062
Mangia. Mangia.

17:32.097 --> 17:35.765
I never thought I'd go over
to the dark-chocolate-side.

17:38.203 --> 17:39.736
Oh!

17:44.843 --> 17:46.776
He is here. I must leave.

17:46.812 --> 17:48.778
Who's here? Oh, right.

17:48.814 --> 17:50.647
Francesco.

17:52.679 --> 17:53.984
Oh...

17:54.323 --> 17:56.773
Ciao, Gene Belcher.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.495
Ciao, Isabella Kitchen Substitute.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.199
I'm taking this home to fix it.

18:09.234 --> 18:10.467
Um, sure.

18:12.328 --> 18:15.705
Huh. Love, it looks like
you can't be stopped.

18:15.741 --> 18:17.748
Yeah. She's just right this way.

18:20.275 --> 18:22.234
Ms. Selbo! What are you doing?

18:22.259 --> 18:24.640
Living my damn life, Linda!

18:24.665 --> 18:27.273
Oh, hello, Martin. I have
a serious boyfriend now.

18:27.298 --> 18:28.564
His name is... Him.

18:28.682 --> 18:30.539
J-Jim... Him Jim.

18:30.564 --> 18:32.197
Jim Himjim.

18:32.222 --> 18:34.355
Well, I... I-I'm gonna go.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.680
Quick question. Do you think
I could have my dog back?

18:36.705 --> 18:38.691
You're so desperate.

18:38.727 --> 18:39.585
Fine.

18:39.610 --> 18:41.844
- Thank you.
- Aw.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.790
Uh... Hi, everyone.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.820
- Wow! Whoa!
- What?

18:47.845 --> 18:50.012
Jimmy Jr., I can't jump up and down.

18:50.075 --> 18:52.209
But I can walk on these stilts.

18:52.234 --> 18:53.898
Uh, wait, no, I can't... Okay, got it.

18:53.923 --> 18:55.289
Where'd you get those, Tina?

18:55.352 --> 18:57.251
A trampoline and thrills
aren't the only thing

18:57.287 --> 18:58.820
Thrills Not Pills left behind.

18:58.855 --> 19:00.154
They also left these.

19:00.190 --> 19:01.622
Now, come on, Jimmy Jr.

19:01.658 --> 19:02.957
We're going to the gymnasium.

19:02.993 --> 19:04.826
- Yeah!
- Wait, what?

19:04.861 --> 19:06.661
We'll be back in five
minutes, Ms. Jacobson.

19:06.696 --> 19:09.030
Excuse me while I sky kiss this guy.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.499
Bob's Burgers.

19:11.534 --> 19:13.267
Hi, Linda. It's your valentine.

19:13.303 --> 19:15.421
Can you come outside?
Your gift is here.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.372
Oh, my God!

19:17.407 --> 19:18.673
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

19:19.117 --> 19:21.017
W-Wait, what's going on?

19:21.052 --> 19:22.185
Why do you look like that?

19:22.220 --> 19:23.343
Bob. Linda.

19:23.368 --> 19:25.351
Hey there, Teddy. Nice boom box.

19:25.376 --> 19:27.359
Thanks, Bob. Dope pants.

19:27.384 --> 19:30.118
Why are you two acting
weird? What's going on?

19:40.305 --> 19:43.273
Bobby, did you take a
dance class? I love it.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.083
- Mind if we hop in that hip?
- What... Uh...

19:51.917 --> 19:54.078
Hey, Louise. Where's Chloe?

19:54.103 --> 19:56.837
Rudy, I have to tell you
something. She's not coming.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.312
Um... Did... Did she not get my card?

19:59.337 --> 20:01.781
She did. Um, but she's still not coming.

20:01.806 --> 20:03.873
Um, do... Do you get what I'm saying?

20:03.898 --> 20:05.218
Not really.

20:05.243 --> 20:06.820
Oh, God! Rudy!

20:06.845 --> 20:08.745
Chloe doesn't want to be your valentine.

20:08.770 --> 20:10.570
But what... what about all those notes?

20:10.595 --> 20:14.430
Oh, my God. Get it through
your thick, round skull, Rudy!

20:14.455 --> 20:16.055
Chloe doesn't like you.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.313
But who cares, right?

20:17.514 --> 20:18.875
I guess I care.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.799
Well, then stop it! Stop caring.

20:20.857 --> 20:23.858
Yeah, okay. Well, thanks
for letting me know, Louise.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.683
I guess I was silly to think
I could get a kiss on Valen...

20:26.718 --> 20:28.518
Mmm!

20:28.553 --> 20:29.619
Sky kiss!

20:29.654 --> 20:31.287
Yeah!

20:31.323 --> 20:32.288
Mwah.

20:32.324 --> 20:33.324
Yeah.

20:33.358 --> 20:34.390
Mmm.

20:35.560 --> 20:36.626
Mwah.

20:38.230 --> 20:39.829
- Mwah!
- Whoa.

20:39.865 --> 20:41.164
Ow.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.800
- If you tell anyone about this...
- Uh-huh.

20:43.835 --> 20:46.882
- I will end you.
- I think I'm sweating.

20:46.907 --> 20:48.484
Excuse me. Coming through.

20:48.550 --> 20:50.317
E-Emergency.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.612
