02:03.855 --> 02:08.761
THE EYES

02:20.156 --> 02:23.656
Subrip: Pix

02:57.094 --> 03:00.431
If it's not too much
trouble may I leave now?

03:00.473 --> 03:04.310
These things are getting
kind of itchy.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.186
Hey.

03:05.979 --> 03:06.813
Wake up.

03:08.772 --> 03:09.731
Hey you.

03:09.774 --> 03:10.525
Shit!

03:10.567 --> 03:11.693
What the hell is this?

03:11.734 --> 03:12.819
What the fuck is this?!

03:12.860 --> 03:14.778
You tell me!

03:14.820 --> 03:16.447
Look, I'm gonna
fucking die, I'm gonna die,

03:16.489 --> 03:17.657
I know I'm gonna fucking die.

03:17.699 --> 03:19.158
Take it easy.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.909
Take it easy.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.871
Do you know any of these people?

03:22.912 --> 03:24.747
What, what, no.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.791
No, who the fuck are they?

03:27.834 --> 03:29.335
I asked you.

03:29.377 --> 03:32.754
Hey, what the fuck
is going on here?

03:32.796 --> 03:35.550
I don't have a clue.

03:35.592 --> 03:36.426
Shit.

03:42.348 --> 03:43.474
Who did this?

03:44.893 --> 03:47.729
I don't know.

03:47.770 --> 03:48.938
But I bet it's a game.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.314
A game?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.317
Fucking six people tied up

03:52.358 --> 03:53.568
knocked the fuck out!

03:53.610 --> 03:58.531
That's not a fucking game!

03:58.532 --> 03:59.574
Kidnapped.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.993
Stun gunned I think.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.664
Drugged I think.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.086
Fuck.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.089
Are some of these people dead?

04:16.132 --> 04:17.257
I hope not.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.302
All I know is
I got out of my car

04:20.345 --> 04:21.971
and I woke up here.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.932
Radical, well I was
smoking a joint

04:24.973 --> 04:28.769
and I closed my eyes and
now I'm fucking here.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.645
Weird.

04:38.071 --> 04:39.864
This can't be good.

04:39.906 --> 04:40.906
Yeah really?

04:43.910 --> 04:46.454
I'm Jaclyn.

04:46.455 --> 04:47.997
What's your name?

04:48.038 --> 04:49.748
I'm sure it's not
coffee bean head.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.127
No it's not
it's Jeffrey actually.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.420
And I hate these damn things.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.674
Then why
do you wear them?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.050
Well, because I have a girl

05:00.968 --> 05:02.678
and she thinks they're sexy.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.474
Does she suck
on your ears when you do it?

05:06.516 --> 05:08.768
Yeah she does actually.

05:08.810 --> 05:13.273
You're right.

05:13.274 --> 05:14.314
Hey wake up!

05:23.824 --> 05:25.284
Stop it!

05:37.880 --> 05:42.927
Welcome to the tie up.

05:42.928 --> 05:44.429
Help!

05:44.470 --> 05:45.305
Somebody help!

05:45.346 --> 05:46.889
Shut the fuck up!

05:49.934 --> 05:50.685
They got me.

05:50.726 --> 05:51.476
Who got you?

05:51.519 --> 05:52.312
They got me.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.521
They got me.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.438
Who got you?

05:54.480 --> 05:56.816
What's the meaning of this?

06:00.444 --> 06:02.029
Shit are you okay?!

06:02.071 --> 06:03.489
Jesus who got you?

06:06.951 --> 06:08.203
The one fucking person
who knows something

06:08.244 --> 06:09.454
and she fucking flips.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.206
Give her some time.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.045
Let me free!

06:18.086 --> 06:19.254
I'll kill you you bastards!

06:19.297 --> 06:21.007
Let me free right now!

06:21.048 --> 06:23.133
Let me free right now!

06:23.175 --> 06:24.051
Let me free!

06:24.093 --> 06:25.011
I kill all of you!

06:25.052 --> 06:26.721
I kill you bastards!

06:26.762 --> 06:27.721
Let us free!

06:27.764 --> 06:29.307
What the fuck.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.016
He's not awake I think.

06:31.059 --> 06:32.560
Hey, wake up.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.936
Come on.

06:33.978 --> 06:35.103
Take it easy.

06:35.146 --> 06:38.274
Wake up, that's it that's right.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.067
That's right.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.110
You're alright.

06:42.153 --> 06:44.404
Okay?

06:44.405 --> 06:45.572
Is that so?

06:47.533 --> 06:49.952
What do you call this?

06:49.994 --> 06:51.746
What's his fucking problem?

06:51.788 --> 06:53.163
He woke up
and found himself tied up

06:53.206 --> 06:55.165
with five other people.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.045
I'm Robby.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.674
What's going on here?

07:03.716 --> 07:06.177
I'm Jeffrey and that
chick across the table,

07:06.218 --> 07:07.219
that's Jaclyn.

07:08.930 --> 07:10.764
I'm Arnold.

07:10.807 --> 07:11.932
Arnold Proctor.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.812
Can any of you explain this?

07:16.813 --> 07:18.105
I think I'm in shock.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.024
Very peculiar, surreal.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.149
Awe, surreal?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.194
Alright this is
fucking real man.

07:24.237 --> 07:24.987
Can you get it?

07:25.028 --> 07:26.363
Real.

07:26.406 --> 07:28.615
And if any of you don't
know why the fuck we're here

07:28.658 --> 07:32.579
then maybe the screaming
bitch next to me does.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.788
I took a sleeping pill.

07:35.999 --> 07:37.709
Yes, right, right.

07:37.750 --> 07:41.879
So then maybe is some kind
of dream or something.

07:43.589 --> 07:46.842
A dream,
try fucking nightmare.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.135
Like the dream I had before,

07:48.177 --> 07:50.012
I was on the ocean.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.431
I was fishing I think.

07:52.473 --> 07:55.018
Like that, a fucking nightmare.

07:57.353 --> 07:59.146
Are we gonna die?

07:59.189 --> 08:03.151
Personally, I really really
feel like I'm gonna die.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.861
Gentlemen, Jeffrey here
is not very optimistic.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.738
Shut the fuck up!

08:10.617 --> 08:13.745
No, no yeah, I guess I'm not.

08:17.874 --> 08:19.209
Look sorry dudes.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.418
I just don't know
why the fuck I'm here.

08:21.461 --> 08:22.420
That's all.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.299
I'll let you be in my dream

08:28.175 --> 08:30.427
if you let me be in yours.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.099
The great Bob Marley.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.102
Or was that Dylan?

08:39.144 --> 08:40.812
This is not a dream.

08:40.855 --> 08:43.024
I don't know maybe we are.

08:44.317 --> 08:47.153
You know, in each others dreams.

08:47.195 --> 08:50.031
Alright Dylan
write something else?

08:50.072 --> 08:52.115
Not that he's dead but...

08:52.158 --> 08:52.908
What is with this guy?

08:52.951 --> 08:54.201
One second
he's acting like Rambo

08:54.244 --> 08:56.663
and the next minute he's
philosophizing about Dylan.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.038
Okay fuck Dylan!

08:58.081 --> 09:00.875
Young man, Bob Dylan
is a great American

09:00.917 --> 09:02.543
songwriter and poet.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.212
Philosopher.

09:05.254 --> 09:06.463
Okay
I don't give a shit!

09:06.505 --> 09:07.881
You should.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.259
Okay, did you see
your dad quit his job

09:10.301 --> 09:11.302
and then listen to
I Ain't Gonna Work

09:11.344 --> 09:12.679
On Maggie's Farm No More
for days

09:12.720 --> 09:13.846
while his family starved?

09:13.888 --> 09:14.848
You know,

09:14.889 --> 09:16.807
unfortunately like a
lot of people your age

09:16.850 --> 09:19.101
you have
a very limited vocabulary.

09:19.143 --> 09:20.269
Well I learned it
from my fucking parents,

09:20.311 --> 09:21.604
people your fucking age.

09:21.645 --> 09:22.646
Fuck you.

09:22.688 --> 09:23.856
What are you?

09:23.898 --> 09:25.233
Some kind of college
professor or some shit?

09:25.274 --> 09:26.525
Harvard.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.901
Impressive.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.862
You dudes are definitely
screwed up man.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.447
Here you are talking
about some dumb shit

09:32.490 --> 09:33.825
when we ought to be
talking about what

09:33.866 --> 09:36.285
the fuck we're all doing here!

09:37.287 --> 09:38.620
I got a bad feeling about this.

09:38.663 --> 09:40.289
Jeffrey.

09:40.331 --> 09:41.249
What?

09:41.291 --> 09:44.294
Whoever is behind this
will be back.

09:44.335 --> 09:46.254
Okay.

09:46.296 --> 09:49.340
Until then, we might as
well get to know each other.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.549
Absolutely.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.720
Maybe we have
some mutual connection.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.224
It might help explain
why we're here.

09:58.225 --> 10:00.475
Yeah, not bad for a professor.

10:00.518 --> 10:03.312
That's what my students say.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.355
Okay well, maybe the
screaming bitch can help

10:05.398 --> 10:08.276
because she knows something.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.568
The man to Jeffrey's left,

10:09.610 --> 10:11.361
does anyone know him?

10:13.740 --> 10:17.159
The guy is a stranger to
me just like the rest of you.

10:17.201 --> 10:21.914
Yeah same here, and the
dude looks like he's dead.

10:21.956 --> 10:22.706
Dude!

10:22.749 --> 10:23.582
Wake up!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.629
Wake up dude!

10:35.052 --> 10:36.596
Christ,
please don't scream again.

10:36.638 --> 10:39.139
Okay, you already blew up
my fucking ears.

10:39.182 --> 10:40.767
Did you tie me up?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.311
Yeah sure,
then I tied myself up.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.354
It must be them.

10:45.395 --> 10:56.658
Them who?

10:56.659 --> 10:58.158
Fuck!

10:58.201 --> 10:58.993
Fucking A!

10:59.034 --> 10:59.868
Fuck!

11:06.417 --> 11:08.418
What's going on?

11:08.461 --> 11:09.921
Who tied me up?!

11:09.962 --> 11:10.712
What is this?

11:10.754 --> 11:11.713
What's going on?!

11:11.755 --> 11:12.589
We don't know.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.341
Untie me!

11:14.384 --> 11:15.717
Will you
fucking untie us dude.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.427
Who are you guys?!

11:25.186 --> 11:27.397
Who are you guys?

11:27.437 --> 11:28.398
I'm Jaclyn.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.442
The professor to my right
is Arnold.

11:31.484 --> 11:33.444
To my left is Robby.

11:33.485 --> 11:37.447
And the woman to Robby's
side we don't know yet.

11:37.490 --> 11:38.448
And the kid next to you with the

11:38.490 --> 11:40.451
coffee bean ears is Jeffrey.

11:40.493 --> 11:41.326
Yeah well the first thing
I'm gonna do

11:41.369 --> 11:42.995
when I get out of here is stick

11:43.037 --> 11:45.874
these fucking earrings
right up your asshole.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.416
I thought you were gonna die?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.834
Fuck off.

11:48.876 --> 11:52.045
Who said anything about dying?

11:52.087 --> 11:53.423
Crazy boy over there.

11:53.464 --> 11:55.967
So what's your name?

11:56.009 --> 11:57.969
Harry, and what's this
dying shit?

11:58.010 --> 12:00.554
Jeffrey just has a bad
feeling about all this.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.639
Okay, well
who the fuck wouldn't?!

12:02.682 --> 12:05.435
Here we are tied up, strangers...

12:05.475 --> 12:06.894
Wait.

12:06.936 --> 12:08.980
We are strangers, right?

12:13.025 --> 12:14.776
Well I don't know any of you.

12:14.818 --> 12:15.861
None of us know a damn thing

12:15.903 --> 12:17.322
except the bitch next to me

12:17.363 --> 12:18.823
and she's scared shitless.

12:18.865 --> 12:20.783
I don't know but,

12:20.825 --> 12:21.993
now that I think about it,

12:22.034 --> 12:24.453
she looks like
somebody I've seen.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.873
Maybe on TV or something.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.875
Yeah, she's pretty sweet.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.752
Okay but she's scared.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.504
Yeah she's terrified.

12:33.546 --> 12:36.466
I have to admit, I'm
a little fearful myself.

12:36.508 --> 12:38.426
You're fearful.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.093
And you're the one
accusing me of having

12:40.135 --> 12:41.887
a limited vocabulary?

12:43.264 --> 12:44.474
You just don't understand
the true power of

12:44.515 --> 12:45.307
language professor.

12:45.350 --> 12:46.308
Really?

12:46.350 --> 12:47.519
Enlighten me.

12:49.479 --> 12:50.437
Okay.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.523
Fearful?

12:51.563 --> 12:53.065
Fearful,

12:53.106 --> 12:55.025
that's not saying nothing man.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.485
What the fuck
does that even mean?!

12:56.528 --> 12:57.611
If you said something like

12:57.653 --> 12:59.447
I'm scared
out of my fucking mind,

12:59.489 --> 13:01.908
then that's fucking
saying something!

13:01.950 --> 13:03.535
Well like communicating?

13:03.576 --> 13:05.327
Yes communicating, thank you.

13:05.370 --> 13:06.955
Whatever you say.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.414
Fuck you man,
what does that say?

13:09.456 --> 13:10.707
It means for you
to go to hell.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.043
Yeah.

13:12.085 --> 13:13.878
What about kiss my ass?

13:13.919 --> 13:15.337
Not quite but okay.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.338
Not strong enough?

13:16.380 --> 13:18.341
Well I just call it
potty mouth.

13:18.383 --> 13:19.716
Yeah, and who asked you?

13:19.759 --> 13:21.885
I don't need to be asked!

13:21.927 --> 13:24.514
I'm tied up
like the rest of you!

13:24.556 --> 13:26.349
I'm tired of hearing you
make a stupid

13:26.390 --> 13:28.892
case out of cussing!

13:28.934 --> 13:30.269
Like it's a good thing!

13:30.311 --> 13:31.479
Just makes you trash!

13:31.520 --> 13:32.938
I'm trash?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.064
Fuck you man!

13:36.442 --> 13:38.986
If you have to cuss, if ever,

13:40.779 --> 13:42.365
you should do it
sparingly and only

13:42.407 --> 13:43.908
at times that warrant it.

13:43.950 --> 13:46.451
Like shut the fuck up ass wipe!

13:47.787 --> 13:50.539
Eloquently put.

13:50.540 --> 13:51.875
Look here now.

13:51.916 --> 13:55.712
As much as I'm enjoying
this philosophical debate,

13:55.753 --> 13:58.131
how about we get back to
what this is all about?

13:58.173 --> 14:00.008
Yeah, like why the fuck
we're here.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.092
Well we know we don't
know each other.

14:02.134 --> 14:02.968
Right?

14:04.011 --> 14:05.220
Right.

14:05.263 --> 14:07.098
So let's search for
what we have in common.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.057
You mean,

14:09.725 --> 14:11.519
if we all have enemies
or something?

14:11.561 --> 14:12.769
Enemies.

14:12.812 --> 14:14.563
Enemies.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.316
Yeah, you don't think
your fucking friends

14:16.356 --> 14:19.110
kidnapped you and tied you
to a fucking chair do you?

14:34.958 --> 14:36.418
Okay, okay great.

14:36.461 --> 14:38.379
What the fuck
does that mean

14:38.421 --> 14:40.381
It means times running out.

14:40.423 --> 14:42.634
It's inevitable that
when that goes to zero

14:42.674 --> 14:45.010
something most certainly
will happen.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.178
We're fucked!

14:46.221 --> 14:47.931
Well let's
focus and figure this out.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.139
I told you, I told all of you,

14:49.182 --> 14:50.475
we're gonna fucking die.

14:50.517 --> 14:51.935
Stop it Jeffrey!

14:53.477 --> 14:54.686
Now let's think.

14:55.605 --> 14:58.524
Somebody wanted
to do this to each of us.

14:58.566 --> 15:00.026
Now why?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.235
Who and why.

15:01.277 --> 15:04.656
Well, I've had a few
bad business deals

15:04.697 --> 15:07.575
that I came out on top of.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.660
Have you ever
sold cattle or horses?

15:09.701 --> 15:11.078
Cattle, what are you
a redneck hick?

15:11.120 --> 15:12.871
And you're a fucking dipstick.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.792
And by the way, sorry
for using your special

15:15.833 --> 15:17.167
fuck word dude.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.795
I can beat the shit
out of you old man.

15:19.837 --> 15:20.879
Not on a bet.

15:20.922 --> 15:22.798
Alright, calm down boy,
ease up man.

15:22.841 --> 15:25.051
Hey look,
I'm not all that bad okay.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.802
Just because
I choose to express myself

15:26.845 --> 15:28.388
in an eloquent fashion.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.555
Jeffrey,

15:29.596 --> 15:33.058
dude, that was
communicated very nicely.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.062
Thank you professor.

15:38.690 --> 15:41.609
To tell you the truth,
we're all fucked.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.277
If you don't like that,
we're fucked!

15:43.318 --> 15:44.653
Okay this is it.

15:44.696 --> 15:46.697
This is bad,
this is really fucking bad!

15:46.739 --> 15:48.658
Gentlemen, excuse me
for saying this,

15:48.700 --> 15:51.494
but we need
to get back on point.

15:51.535 --> 15:55.623
Now who and why
would do this to us?

15:55.624 --> 15:58.501
Let me ask you a question.

15:58.543 --> 16:00.669
No one's come in here yet right?

16:00.711 --> 16:01.670
No.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.505
Well maybe they won't.

16:03.548 --> 16:06.509
So why don't we get out
of these damn ropes?

16:06.551 --> 16:08.677
Okay, and how do you
suppose we do that

16:08.720 --> 16:10.346
Simple.

16:10.388 --> 16:12.223
Alright let's do it.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.561
Jeffrey.

16:16.562 --> 16:17.562
Just stand up.

16:19.522 --> 16:21.816
Simple redneck know how dude.

16:40.293 --> 16:43.379
You better untie me.

16:43.421 --> 16:45.507
Welcome to the group.

16:45.548 --> 16:46.966
I'm Jaclyn.

16:47.008 --> 16:48.384
I'm Victoria.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.303
Has Johnny come in?

16:51.346 --> 16:53.556
No one's come in.

16:53.597 --> 16:54.598
Who is Johnny?

16:56.392 --> 16:57.727
You don't know?

17:00.230 --> 17:01.272
He's with he mob.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.481
Fuck?!

17:02.523 --> 17:05.943
I have nothing to do
with the fucking mob!

17:09.739 --> 17:11.532
Just untie me.

17:20.375 --> 17:21.209
Jesus!

17:24.002 --> 17:26.213
Good morning.

17:26.256 --> 17:28.800
What the fuck is this man?!

17:28.842 --> 17:30.134
Jeffrey,
everything will be

17:30.175 --> 17:31.802
explained to you in time.

17:31.845 --> 17:33.637
First enjoy some treats.

17:53.866 --> 17:55.742
Look at this now.

17:55.785 --> 17:58.246
Care took kidnapper with class.

18:01.833 --> 18:05.586
Apparently it comes
with first feeding.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.797
Who are you
and why are we here?

18:07.838 --> 18:09.339
Jaclyn
the coffee is waiting

18:09.382 --> 18:11.509
but the answer is coming.

18:12.969 --> 18:17.222
All of you feel free to use the
bathroom over in the corner.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.809
And you may
remain untied as long

18:20.852 --> 18:25.230
as you do not try to
escape from this room.

18:25.272 --> 18:29.026
The last shot will serve
as your one warning.

18:31.528 --> 18:38.702
Anyone trying to escape will
be executed immediately.

18:38.703 --> 18:41.163
Do we understand each other?

18:42.289 --> 18:43.124
Good.

18:44.666 --> 18:48.670
Until I get back to you
continue to get know each other.

18:49.797 --> 18:52.717
I promise you,
it's very important.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.769
Boy these people
are not playing around.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.312
Yeah, fucking A.

19:05.355 --> 19:06.855
Executed?

19:06.897 --> 19:08.690
Yes, fucking executed.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.984
Hold on a minute though.

19:11.027 --> 19:14.864
Him call them Jeffrey
and Jaclyn by their name.

19:14.905 --> 19:16.865
They know us.

19:16.907 --> 19:18.200
Fuck.

19:19.868 --> 19:20.869
Come on kid.

19:22.079 --> 19:23.830
We'll work this out.

19:23.873 --> 19:28.044
Come Victoria, let's get
some of that coffee?

19:28.086 --> 19:28.920
Not me.

19:30.046 --> 19:32.507
I'm headed for the bathroom.

19:58.074 --> 19:59.741
That's good.

19:59.784 --> 20:02.161
I wonder why they're
treating us so well.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.663
On one hand
they talk about executing us,

20:04.705 --> 20:07.082
on the other
they treat us like guests.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.542
Coffee and donuts.

20:08.585 --> 20:09.669
You know, I don't think
the guy with the gun

20:09.711 --> 20:11.045
really thought of us as guests.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.963
What about the word escape?

20:13.006 --> 20:14.548
Do not try to escape.

20:14.590 --> 20:15.757
That implies
that we're prisoners.

20:15.799 --> 20:19.636
We are
their fucking prisoners.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.264
Coffee.

20:22.307 --> 20:24.767
Yeah but the word that
I'm more curious about

20:24.808 --> 20:26.476
is executed right?

20:28.730 --> 20:30.606
Why not just killed?

20:30.647 --> 20:33.192
Like if you try to escape
you will be killed.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.318
Exactly.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.819
You may have a point.

20:35.862 --> 20:37.322
People are killed all the time.

20:37.363 --> 20:39.157
Plane crash,
car crash, but executed?

20:39.199 --> 20:40.325
That means that...

20:40.365 --> 20:41.992
That you were judged.

20:42.035 --> 20:43.202
Found guilty.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.620
And punished.

20:45.747 --> 20:48.166
Maybe it's something we did.

20:48.208 --> 20:50.835
You know, like who did you kill?

20:53.253 --> 20:56.173
Maybe this is a game
to test our wits.

20:56.215 --> 20:58.133
You know,
for someone who woke up

20:58.175 --> 20:58.967
screaming her fucking head off,

20:59.009 --> 21:00.636
you sure are calm.

21:00.678 --> 21:03.014
Being tied up freaked me out.

21:03.056 --> 21:03.806
What about that stuff you said

21:03.847 --> 21:06.017
about us getting
to know each other?

21:06.058 --> 21:07.935
Yeah man,
that was a bit strange.

21:07.977 --> 21:09.812
See but what I wanna know is,

21:09.854 --> 21:11.730
what is so important
that we have

21:11.772 --> 21:13.357
to get to know one another?

21:14.608 --> 21:17.361
We have to go
with what we got.

21:17.403 --> 21:19.864
Let's take these to the table.

21:19.905 --> 21:22.366
Maybe we can
get to know each other

21:22.407 --> 21:23.825
over these donuts.

21:25.036 --> 21:26.246
Don't you think?

21:32.626 --> 21:36.673
Say honey, can you bring
me some of that coffee?

21:38.090 --> 21:39.424
Sure.

21:39.467 --> 21:42.637
You want it on your head
or in a cup?

21:44.471 --> 21:46.849
You've done
lots of things for men,

21:46.891 --> 21:48.017
haven't you?

21:48.058 --> 21:50.228
What's a cup of coffee?

21:50.269 --> 21:51.687
People!

21:51.729 --> 21:53.690
Meet Victoria Mitchell.

21:54.606 --> 21:57.860
Former Miss America contestant
and Miss Puerto Rico

21:57.902 --> 22:01.072
and for some years now,
porn star.

22:01.114 --> 22:03.199
I mean super star.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.076
Alright, you're
being rude now.

22:05.117 --> 22:06.827
Alright, show the woman
some respect.

22:06.869 --> 22:09.162
If you want coffee, get up
and get it your damn self.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.247
It's okay.

22:11.708 --> 22:12.542
It's okay.

22:16.086 --> 22:19.965
I think we'll start getting
to know each other with me.

22:20.008 --> 22:22.218
Why we could even get
to the naked truth.

22:22.259 --> 22:23.802
Isn't that right?

22:28.016 --> 22:30.476
So, what's your name cowboy?

22:32.519 --> 22:34.855
Harry, it's Harry.

22:36.566 --> 22:39.193
That's a name for a nice man.

22:39.234 --> 22:51.288
What was your mother thinking?

22:51.289 --> 22:53.500
You know you don't have
to talk because of him.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.501
No it's okay.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.920
I got a lot to say.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.506
Would anyone
like to guess what's got

22:59.547 --> 23:01.423
Harry so pissed off?

23:01.465 --> 23:04.134
This is getting good.

23:04.176 --> 23:05.719
I would say Harry

23:07.305 --> 23:09.057
has an addiction.

23:10.599 --> 23:13.936
This is getting
really fucking good.

23:13.978 --> 23:16.064
Thanks for your concern,

23:16.105 --> 23:19.776
but I got Jesus now,
so thank you whore.

23:19.817 --> 23:21.568
Alright, now it seems
like I'm gonna

23:21.611 --> 23:23.947
have to come over
and tend to you.

23:23.988 --> 23:27.366
Allow me to make a proper
introduction again.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.700
I'm Robby.

23:28.742 --> 23:30.744
This here is Jaclyn
and to her right

23:30.787 --> 23:33.664
we have our
Harvard professor Arnold.

23:33.705 --> 23:34.957
And the boy to the left of you

23:34.999 --> 23:37.961
with them coffee bean
earrings, his name Jeffrey.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.087
Enough with the boy.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.296
It's just an expression
where I'm from.

23:41.338 --> 23:44.133
Alright, no disrespect.

23:44.174 --> 23:47.302
Of course you know Harry right?

23:47.345 --> 23:49.137
Yes, but I think
Harry knows me

23:49.180 --> 23:50.056
better than I know him.

23:51.766 --> 23:54.102
That's fucking funny.

23:54.143 --> 23:56.479
Thanks, I try.

23:57.396 --> 23:59.356
I've never seen that before.

23:59.398 --> 24:01.191
His girlfriend
gave them to him.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.528
I usually take them off
when I get home,

24:03.569 --> 24:06.990
but I fell asleep
and then I woke up here.

24:08.657 --> 24:11.285
I have no idea how I got here.

24:12.161 --> 24:13.078
When I woke

24:14.329 --> 24:16.164
I was terrified.

24:16.207 --> 24:17.542
Yeah we know.

24:17.584 --> 24:19.919
Sounds like most of
us were drugged somehow.

24:19.961 --> 24:21.171
I'm sure I was.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.629
Yeah.

24:22.672 --> 24:23.506
Jaclyn,

24:24.257 --> 24:26.176
what happened with you?

24:26.217 --> 24:27.634
I was attacked.

24:27.676 --> 24:29.636
After I got out of my car then

24:29.679 --> 24:33.182
maybe drugged
to keep me out I suppose.

24:33.223 --> 24:35.184
Victoria who is Johnny?

24:35.226 --> 24:37.145
Do you think he could
be behind all this?

24:37.186 --> 24:38.770
Definitely not.

24:38.813 --> 24:40.565
Instead of donuts and
coffee there would be

24:40.606 --> 24:42.817
chains and baseball bats.

24:42.858 --> 24:47.154
You must be in trouble
with this guy Johnny.

24:47.196 --> 24:48.030
I am.

24:49.365 --> 24:50.991
For what?

24:51.034 --> 24:54.162
That's enough
about me for now.

24:54.203 --> 24:57.164
Jaclyn, what do you
do for a living?

24:57.207 --> 25:00.251
I'm a lawyer
with many hats I would say.

25:00.292 --> 25:01.335
A lawyer.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.462
I could use a new lawyer.

25:03.505 --> 25:06.341
Yeah, you could pay with sex.

25:06.382 --> 25:07.549
Enough!

25:07.592 --> 25:09.259
Hey, fuck you!

25:09.301 --> 25:10.594
Come on!

25:10.636 --> 25:13.096
Throwing fits isn't gonna
help us figure this out!

25:13.138 --> 25:16.308
Yeah and being rude
won't help either.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.103
Sit down please.

25:25.902 --> 25:27.069
Jaclyn is right.

25:27.111 --> 25:28.446
We need to figure out
how each of us

25:28.488 --> 25:30.823
is important in relation
to this situation.

25:30.865 --> 25:33.284
Now let's start with Harry.

25:33.326 --> 25:35.036
What do we know so far?

25:35.077 --> 25:36.412
Besides his little problem?

25:36.453 --> 25:37.288
Shut up punk.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.164
Harry what do you
do for a living?

25:39.207 --> 25:41.125
I'm a cowboy.

25:41.166 --> 25:42.626
You mean on a ranch?

25:42.669 --> 25:44.254
Yeah.

25:44.295 --> 25:47.465
Had a huge place
up in the Dakota's.

25:47.507 --> 25:50.677
My wife left me some time ago.

25:50.718 --> 25:53.221
I came back to see her.

25:53.262 --> 25:55.305
Now that I've been saved.

25:55.347 --> 25:57.140
How did that work out?

25:57.182 --> 25:58.852
It didn't.

25:58.893 --> 26:00.103
Do you have any enemies
you know of

26:00.144 --> 26:01.395
that would put you here?

26:01.436 --> 26:02.271
Well,

26:03.730 --> 26:06.108
I had a few bar fights
over in Costa.

26:06.150 --> 26:08.027
Still, I see
no connection between

26:08.068 --> 26:09.863
me and you all.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.698
Where were you
when you were abducted?

26:22.375 --> 26:24.794
Motel 6, I was at a Motel 6.

26:28.298 --> 26:32.719
What, did your wife
cancel the skinemax Harry?

26:32.759 --> 26:34.179
What about you?

26:34.220 --> 26:36.639
I was at my house,
getting out of my car.

26:36.681 --> 26:39.308
A friend I thought
tapped on my window.

26:39.349 --> 26:41.101
I got out, I woke up here.

26:41.144 --> 26:42.353
Some friend.

26:42.394 --> 26:45.315
Anyone after you Jaclyn?

26:45.355 --> 26:46.191
No.

26:47.357 --> 26:48.150
No?

26:48.192 --> 26:49.152
You sure?

26:49.193 --> 26:50.360
'Cause you don't sound
all that convinced.

26:50.403 --> 26:52.363
I've had a few squabbles
but no one

26:52.404 --> 26:55.365
I know of
could have pulled this off.

26:55.407 --> 26:57.659
And then there's this
mysterious connection

26:57.701 --> 26:58.661
between all of us.

26:58.702 --> 26:59.662
Yeah.

26:59.703 --> 27:01.496
Quite an assignment he gave us.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.915
I mean, where do you start?

27:02.957 --> 27:04.167
Yeah and how the fuck
does it end up?

27:04.209 --> 27:05.919
Yeah, but we should
just do what him said.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.336
I think we're
on the right track.

27:07.377 --> 27:08.378
How did we get here?

27:08.421 --> 27:10.215
What possible enemies
do we have?

27:10.256 --> 27:11.298
Yo Arnold, what about you?

27:11.340 --> 27:12.966
Where were you last?

27:13.009 --> 27:14.259
At home.

27:14.301 --> 27:17.804
Like I said I took a sleeping
pill, slept like a baby.

27:17.846 --> 27:20.517
I was shocked to wake up here.

27:20.557 --> 27:22.227
This is incredible.

27:22.268 --> 27:25.020
These people,
they excel at what they do.

27:25.063 --> 27:26.189
Professionals.

27:26.230 --> 27:27.898
No doubt,
but are they criminals

27:27.941 --> 27:28.942
or are they the government?

27:28.982 --> 27:29.775
Yeah.

27:29.817 --> 27:31.109
All do respect, Robby,

27:31.152 --> 27:32.403
I think that's highly unlikely.

27:32.444 --> 27:34.364
Yes Chuck, highly unlikely.

27:34.404 --> 27:36.990
Can we stay serious
for a minute?

27:37.032 --> 27:38.408
Fuck you Harry.

27:38.451 --> 27:39.243
So Arnold,

27:40.662 --> 27:42.372
who are your enemies?

27:42.413 --> 27:44.207
None of your students I hope.

27:44.249 --> 27:45.415
I hope not.

27:47.836 --> 27:49.127
I'm with Jaclyn on this.

27:49.170 --> 27:50.755
I can't think of a single person

27:50.797 --> 27:52.798
who'd want me to be here.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.633
I did flunk
a few students but then

27:54.675 --> 27:56.593
I helped them make it up,
they graduated.

27:59.263 --> 28:00.764
We're being recorded.

28:00.807 --> 28:02.642
Yeah no shit.

28:02.683 --> 28:03.643
They probably know every little

28:03.684 --> 28:07.313
fucking thing about us anyway.

28:07.314 --> 28:09.524
Okay, who here is married?

28:13.236 --> 28:14.362
There it is!

28:14.403 --> 28:16.029
Something we have in common.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.155
No, no, no, no,

28:17.198 --> 28:19.200
I thought Harry was married.

28:19.241 --> 28:22.327
Who haven't
we talked about yet?

28:22.369 --> 28:24.121
Me, the cute one.

28:25.373 --> 28:26.665
Is that true Victoria.

28:26.708 --> 28:27.625
Please.

28:27.666 --> 28:30.002
I'd take you home.

28:30.044 --> 28:31.336
Bitch.

28:31.378 --> 28:33.839
Okay, let's keep it in
the realm of reality here.

28:33.882 --> 28:36.384
Robby tell us about yourself.

28:36.425 --> 28:38.260
Alright.

28:38.261 --> 28:40.305
Well I'm a commercial fisherman.

28:40.346 --> 28:42.848
Not married or nothing
like that but,

28:42.891 --> 28:46.102
got my boat after a
disservice from the country.

28:46.144 --> 28:49.396
Trying to forget things
no one should see.

28:49.439 --> 28:51.399
But I'm much happy now so I just

28:51.441 --> 28:53.442
try to focus on the good.

28:53.483 --> 28:56.445
Run any drugs man?

28:56.446 --> 28:58.238
Boy you need help man.

29:00.407 --> 29:03.619
Well maybe I should've
been a dope head like you.

29:03.661 --> 29:05.078
Well that
would've been better

29:05.121 --> 29:10.835
than a pile of whiskey
bottles out behind your shack.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.086
What's going on here?

29:12.127 --> 29:13.420
Yeah, did I hit a nerve?

29:13.462 --> 29:15.173
Gentlemen.

29:17.634 --> 29:19.635
Who are you people?!

29:19.676 --> 29:21.471
Why did you bring me here?!

29:21.512 --> 29:23.055
You're fucking
crazy dude.

29:23.096 --> 29:24.473
So not only
is Harry a degenerate

29:24.516 --> 29:27.143
but he's also a paranoid drunk.

29:27.184 --> 29:28.519
I've been saved!

29:28.560 --> 29:29.853
By who, the devil?

29:29.895 --> 29:31.813
I'm gonna kill you.

29:31.855 --> 29:33.441
-Stop it!
-Get outta my way!

29:33.482 --> 29:34.983
Stop it!

29:43.785 --> 29:47.913
Harry, Harry, Harry.

29:47.914 --> 29:49.081
His heart stopped.

29:49.123 --> 29:52.251
No, no, no, come on Harry,
come on.

29:54.461 --> 29:55.838
Come on!

29:55.880 --> 29:57.841
Just
what he always wanted.

29:57.882 --> 29:59.634
No more jokes okay!

29:59.675 --> 30:02.095
Get down here
and pump on his chest!

30:02.135 --> 30:03.303
Come on!

30:03.346 --> 30:04.263
Harry, Harry.

30:04.305 --> 30:05.306
Go away man!

30:06.598 --> 30:08.518
Victoria, Victoria, they
don't recommend that anymore,

30:08.559 --> 30:10.727
it's just the quick
thrusts like Robby's doing.

30:10.769 --> 30:13.730
Well,
it couldn't hurt.

30:19.028 --> 30:20.320
What happened?

30:20.363 --> 30:22.865
Robby and Victoria
just saved your life dude.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.908
Yo she fucking kissed you!

30:24.951 --> 30:27.370
Okay, that's close.

30:27.412 --> 30:28.371
It's better.

30:28.413 --> 30:30.539
Harry we need you
to keep your cool.

30:30.582 --> 30:31.332
I gotta get up.

30:31.374 --> 30:32.125
No, no, no, no, no,

30:32.166 --> 30:34.586
just a minute there, cowboy.

30:34.626 --> 30:35.502
My god.

30:35.545 --> 30:36.880
You knocked me out.

30:36.921 --> 30:38.756
No dude, you
had a fucking heart attack!

30:38.798 --> 30:41.550
Dude she gave you
mouth to mouth!

30:42.594 --> 30:46.681
Now, now you've
really been saved?

30:46.722 --> 30:47.764
Excuse me!

30:49.267 --> 30:52.394
We need medical assistance
here please!

30:53.770 --> 30:54.605
Hello?!

30:56.648 --> 30:57.482
Hello!

31:03.865 --> 31:05.325
Aspirin, really?

31:09.369 --> 31:11.747
This better be sufficient.

31:11.788 --> 31:12.624
Aspirin.

31:16.085 --> 31:17.921
Can you sit up?

31:17.961 --> 31:19.297
Can you sit up?

31:20.673 --> 31:21.965
Come on big guy.

31:22.008 --> 31:22.967
Come on.

31:23.009 --> 31:23.843
Here.

31:29.641 --> 31:32.602
I always wanted
to be a doctor.

31:32.644 --> 31:34.645
When I would tell that
to my co-stars

31:34.686 --> 31:36.605
someone would always joke
that I already

31:36.647 --> 31:38.398
had a good bedside manner.

31:42.194 --> 31:44.696
I always laugh at my own jokes.

31:46.615 --> 31:49.576
I'm sorry
I called you a whore.

31:49.618 --> 31:51.078
Jesus Harry.

31:51.119 --> 31:54.831
You think you're the
first that's said that?

31:54.874 --> 31:56.625
Hey, how are you feeling

31:56.667 --> 31:57.668
I'm okay.

31:57.710 --> 31:58.586
Come on help me up now.

31:58.627 --> 31:59.878
Alright wait,
wait, before that

31:59.921 --> 32:03.173
I need to apologize to you for

32:03.215 --> 32:04.550
calling you a drunk.

32:04.592 --> 32:05.426
Alright?

32:06.510 --> 32:07.553
I was wrong.

32:08.512 --> 32:10.682
I am a drunk.

32:10.722 --> 32:13.433
I just don't like hearing
it from someone else.

32:13.476 --> 32:14.477
Help me up.

32:14.519 --> 32:16.479
Alright come.

32:23.862 --> 32:27.740
Anybody need a cup?

32:27.741 --> 32:29.701
Give me a large.

32:45.508 --> 32:47.634
Okay, so, do we think
we know enough about

32:47.676 --> 32:49.344
each other yet?

32:49.386 --> 32:50.888
Well we know
what each of us does.

32:50.930 --> 32:53.557
Right, and we've
concluded that

32:53.599 --> 32:56.435
none of us has any past
knowledge of the others.

32:56.477 --> 32:57.729
Nothing that would
have any bearing on

32:57.769 --> 32:59.646
why we're here that is.

32:59.689 --> 33:03.067
Also none of us
are currently married.

33:03.108 --> 33:04.109
What about Jeffrey?

33:04.152 --> 33:06.362
Well we know
he loves the F bomb.

33:06.403 --> 33:07.154
Fuck you dude.

33:07.196 --> 33:08.197
Okay honestly fuck you.

33:08.239 --> 33:10.365
Jeffrey, what do you
do for a living?

33:10.407 --> 33:12.534
What, do you think I'm a fucking
dope dealer or some shit?

33:12.576 --> 33:15.747
I didn't mean anything
by it, Jeffrey.

33:15.788 --> 33:18.040
Do you have a job boy?

33:18.082 --> 33:19.918
Sorry Jeffrey.

33:19.959 --> 33:22.170
Yeah, then get the chip
off your blood clot

33:22.211 --> 33:24.129
and help us
figure this thing out.

33:24.172 --> 33:25.714
Now where do you work?

33:25.757 --> 33:28.176
I work at
a fucking slaughter house.

33:28.218 --> 33:29.093
Really?

33:29.134 --> 33:30.094
Someone has to fucking do it

33:30.135 --> 33:31.971
so you can have your
hamburgers and steaks.

33:32.012 --> 33:34.557
For what,
your little country club?

33:34.598 --> 33:36.600
Harry grows them
and I kill them.

33:36.643 --> 33:37.684
Funny.

33:37.727 --> 33:39.521
Sounds like you
don't like your job.

33:39.561 --> 33:42.481
Yeah I don't,
it's a fucking job.

33:44.651 --> 33:46.027
You guys wouldn't
believe me but I've

33:46.068 --> 33:49.279
actually been employee of
the month like six times.

33:49.321 --> 33:52.115
Ever since I started
hooking up with Gloria.

33:52.157 --> 33:54.993
Is that your girlfriend?

33:55.036 --> 33:56.578
I work with her.

33:56.621 --> 34:00.333
Yeah she's fucking dope.

34:00.334 --> 34:02.544
I do two things in my life.

34:02.585 --> 34:04.295
All night I look at dead things

34:04.336 --> 34:07.507
and then all day
I'm with the most

34:07.548 --> 34:15.849
fucking alive creature
that I've ever been with.

34:15.850 --> 34:19.643
I hope you're
not offended but like,

34:19.686 --> 34:22.313
when we have sex
it's like fucking rowdy.

34:22.355 --> 34:23.815
It's like
the most amazing thing.

34:23.856 --> 34:25.148
Fucking.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.233
Marry her.

34:26.275 --> 34:28.402
It's a good fucking idea.

34:28.443 --> 34:30.362
Do you love her?

34:30.405 --> 34:32.031
I mean I guess.

34:32.072 --> 34:33.532
How do you know?

34:35.784 --> 34:37.744
What I imagine is that you

34:37.786 --> 34:41.206
simply have to be with
them and enjoy everything.

34:41.248 --> 34:43.458
Going grocery shopping,

34:43.501 --> 34:45.585
taking a trip to the beach,

34:45.628 --> 34:47.755
holding your kids.

34:47.797 --> 34:49.547
And most importantly,

34:49.590 --> 34:52.134
you aren't thinking
about anyone else.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.553
Shit.

34:53.594 --> 34:54.636
I'm in love.

34:54.679 --> 34:55.847
Amen.

34:55.889 --> 34:57.139
I'm gonna fucking marry her.

34:57.181 --> 34:58.849
That's it!

34:58.891 --> 34:59.933
Yeah!

34:59.976 --> 35:01.102
Good for you!

35:02.896 --> 35:05.648
Do you still know
how to make movies?

35:05.690 --> 35:07.275
No.

35:11.278 --> 35:13.697
Not since I was raped and cut.

35:14.699 --> 35:16.659
Fuck, I'm sorry.

35:16.701 --> 35:18.869
No I was just asking
because I was

35:18.911 --> 35:22.289
gonna say you can be a counselor
or something if you wanted.

35:22.331 --> 35:23.290
Could be.

35:24.501 --> 35:26.836
I have seen it all.

35:26.878 --> 35:28.796
I guess I'm ready to talk.

35:28.838 --> 35:29.631
Really talk.

35:31.215 --> 35:33.926
Harry got me
thinking about this.

35:35.135 --> 35:35.969
Please.

35:38.889 --> 35:43.728
I used to love men
looking at me.

35:43.729 --> 35:45.771
Lusting at my breast.

35:45.813 --> 35:47.356
Lusting after me.

35:49.943 --> 35:52.153
I starred in over 100 films.

35:53.362 --> 35:54.696
Then I was raped.

35:56.740 --> 35:59.869
I would have done it
with the guy.

35:59.911 --> 36:01.287
But he beat me,

36:03.956 --> 36:04.665
tied me up,

36:06.501 --> 36:07.418
and cut me.

36:09.711 --> 36:15.259
But I was mental
for a long time.

36:15.300 --> 36:19.264
And I hated men.

36:19.265 --> 36:21.057
I turned to women.

36:21.099 --> 36:22.934
I ended up with this dyke

36:22.976 --> 36:24.727
and she beat me.

36:24.768 --> 36:26.353
Can you believe it?

36:26.396 --> 36:28.731
Look, you don't have
to tell us all that.

36:28.773 --> 36:29.816
Maybe not.

36:31.775 --> 36:35.112
But I think it's time
I told someone.

36:35.153 --> 36:35.989
Besides,

36:37.574 --> 36:40.492
it seems like
we're here to talk.

36:40.534 --> 36:41.368
Right?

36:44.706 --> 36:48.459
I wish I was a little girl
again with my single mom.

36:48.501 --> 36:50.961
She pushed her fiancé
out a 10 story window

36:51.003 --> 36:53.630
when she caught him touching me.

36:54.923 --> 36:59.512
He crashed on the top of
an ambulance driving by.

36:59.554 --> 37:01.931
And guess what?

37:01.932 --> 37:04.266
They couldn't save him.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.769
The funny thing is
that after that,

37:07.811 --> 37:10.606
after he did what he did to me,

37:11.608 --> 37:13.359
no one could save me.

37:16.528 --> 37:20.157
For me two things made
me a porn star Harry.

37:21.826 --> 37:23.702
Being born a goddess

37:25.246 --> 37:26.789
and having the devil
make sure that

37:26.831 --> 37:31.044
I was miserable and desperate.

37:32.045 --> 37:35.965
And he sweetened up the
deal with money and fame.

37:38.927 --> 37:41.596
I didn't mean to harm anybody.

37:44.056 --> 37:45.516
My mom never said a curse word

37:45.557 --> 37:47.851
even with all the shit I did.

37:49.853 --> 37:51.813
She set a good example.

37:53.065 --> 38:01.199
But she never understood
how messed up I was.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.032
She died.

38:03.867 --> 38:04.994
Fucking cancer.

38:11.041 --> 38:13.293
What an oxymoron breasts are.

38:14.461 --> 38:18.632
They give you lust and love.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.926
As well as tragedy and death.

38:40.112 --> 38:40.946
Fuck!

38:42.322 --> 38:44.491
Please, please
don't shoot me please!

38:44.534 --> 38:48.704
Are you just gonna shoot
us with no explanation?!

38:48.746 --> 38:51.081
Only one of you.

38:56.253 --> 38:57.087
Harry,

38:58.630 --> 38:59.464
stand up.

39:03.135 --> 39:06.054
No dear Lord,
forgive me for my sins.

39:06.097 --> 39:07.932
Take him.

39:18.150 --> 39:18.984
Harry.

39:22.155 --> 39:24.449
Harry, Harry, Harry!

39:24.489 --> 39:26.658
Harry!

39:26.701 --> 39:27.534
Fuck!

39:40.882 --> 39:42.342
My god.

39:45.135 --> 39:47.429
Hey what the fuck is this?!

39:58.315 --> 39:59.442
Come here!

39:59.483 --> 40:00.567
Get your fucking hands off!

40:00.610 --> 40:01.653
I'm fucking leaving you asshole!

40:01.693 --> 40:02.862
You're gonna leave me?!

40:02.903 --> 40:03.987
What the
fuck is this you sick...

40:04.030 --> 40:06.157
Those are just movies!

40:06.199 --> 40:07.951
What the fuck
is wrong with you!

40:07.992 --> 40:08.868
Stop it!

40:08.909 --> 40:11.119
Where are you going?!

40:11.161 --> 40:12.746
Fuck you!

40:22.047 --> 40:24.091
God.

40:24.132 --> 40:26.218
That's enough.

40:34.811 --> 40:35.644
Stop!

40:47.574 --> 40:49.534
Five of you are left.

40:49.576 --> 40:51.702
None of you have told the
truth about yourselves.

40:51.744 --> 40:53.121
Who are you people?!

40:53.161 --> 40:55.706
Yeah who the fuck are you?!

40:56.791 --> 41:00.920
I can tell
you that we watch people.

41:03.755 --> 41:05.132
We watch a lot of people
with devices

41:05.175 --> 41:07.427
beyond the imagination.

41:07.467 --> 41:09.136
We have eyes everywhere

41:09.179 --> 41:12.764
and see people commit
crimes of all kinds.

41:12.806 --> 41:14.057
Crimes that they get away with

41:14.099 --> 41:15.393
just like the rest of you did.

41:15.434 --> 41:16.853
Awe come on man, go to hell!

41:16.894 --> 41:18.938
You don't have nothing on us!

41:18.980 --> 41:20.398
Denial won't work with us.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.108
We make our judgment based
on indisputable proof.

41:23.150 --> 41:25.777
Then take us
to a real trial then

41:25.820 --> 41:27.113
We do that our own way.

41:27.155 --> 41:28.823
The evidence we have
can't be used

41:28.864 --> 41:30.949
in the conventional system
with so called

41:30.992 --> 41:34.162
technicalities rob
society of true justice.

41:34.204 --> 41:36.206
And when the shameless
plea bargain lawyers

41:36.246 --> 41:39.375
prevent real justice
from being executed.

41:39.416 --> 41:41.585
So you're some kind
of vigilante group

41:41.628 --> 41:44.797
that's gonna save the world
from would be criminals!

41:44.838 --> 41:47.967
Genuine criminals
Jaclyn just like Harry.

41:48.009 --> 41:49.635
But we are not vigilantes.

41:49.677 --> 41:51.179
We're government funded.

41:51.221 --> 41:52.347
Horseshit!

41:52.387 --> 41:53.597
Think about it Jeffrey.

41:53.639 --> 41:55.807
A government funded program
designed

41:55.849 --> 41:57.184
to kill people!

41:57.226 --> 41:59.186
That sounds just like
some jails bond type thing

41:59.228 --> 42:01.480
or some Bourne Identity!

42:01.523 --> 42:02.981
It's a fucking movie!

42:03.023 --> 42:06.818
No man, it's based off
reality, I've seen it!

42:06.860 --> 42:10.280
No okay,
this is not fucking real okay?!

42:11.324 --> 42:12.075
This is bullshit!

42:12.115 --> 42:13.076
None of us
should fucking be here!

42:13.117 --> 42:15.827
I'm an attorney and I
demand that you let us go!

42:15.869 --> 42:18.163
You are violating our rights!

42:26.338 --> 42:27.923
Enough of this!

42:31.052 --> 42:33.262
I'd like to call my lawyer.

42:33.304 --> 42:35.222
So he can get
paid to sell your lies.

42:35.264 --> 42:36.682
No man it's called
a proper defense!

42:36.724 --> 42:38.101
A real trial!

42:38.141 --> 42:39.810
You will get a fair trial.

42:39.853 --> 42:41.061
Government program or not.

42:41.103 --> 42:43.730
What you are doing
is unconstitutional.

42:43.773 --> 42:46.233
You need to release us
immediately!

42:46.275 --> 42:48.277
Nice try Jaclyn.

42:48.318 --> 42:50.070
Would you like
to hear our terms?

42:50.112 --> 42:52.114
What congressman would
vote for such a program!?

42:52.155 --> 42:53.824
I know a few.

42:53.867 --> 42:56.452
Why would they do that?

42:56.494 --> 42:58.121
Money.

42:58.161 --> 43:00.205
This can't be fucking true!

43:00.248 --> 43:01.666
Jeffrey,
you know what those in

43:01.708 --> 43:04.085
prison cost the government
every year?

43:04.126 --> 43:06.336
Do you know what it
costs to execute someone?

43:06.378 --> 43:08.297
No and I don't give a shit!

43:08.338 --> 43:09.673
Excuse me.

43:09.715 --> 43:12.176
Is what you're saying,
that killing us,

43:12.217 --> 43:14.219
assuming we're guilty
of these heinous crimes

43:14.262 --> 43:16.556
will lower the debt?

43:16.597 --> 43:18.349
That's ludicrous!

43:18.391 --> 43:19.934
Especially
after the program

43:19.976 --> 43:22.144
grows into other states.

43:22.186 --> 43:24.938
So if I was in any other
state I wouldn't be here?!

43:24.981 --> 43:26.149
Correct!

43:26.190 --> 43:28.775
Fuck, just my fucking luck!

43:29.610 --> 43:31.487
Jeffrey honey.

43:31.528 --> 43:34.949
I don't think they're gonna
kill all of us.

43:34.990 --> 43:35.824
Right?

43:37.409 --> 43:41.163
You're not gonna
kill all of us are you?

43:41.206 --> 43:43.708
Four more of
you will be dead by midnight.

43:43.750 --> 43:46.085
Well fuck that!

43:47.128 --> 43:48.171
Maybe you
should of thought about

43:48.213 --> 43:50.923
paying the price before you
did what you did Jeffrey.

43:50.965 --> 43:52.467
Hey fuck you man!

43:54.760 --> 43:56.971
What did you do?

43:57.012 --> 43:58.347
Nothing!

43:58.389 --> 44:02.143
They got me screwed up
with the wrong person!

44:03.353 --> 44:05.021
There's a
very deep spot in the ocean

44:05.063 --> 44:06.481
just 20 miles out.

44:08.273 --> 44:09.775
Four of you will be executed

44:09.817 --> 44:12.402
and your bodies will sink
down two miles

44:12.445 --> 44:15.532
to join the other criminals
waiting to greet you.

44:15.572 --> 44:17.491
Bullshit!

44:17.534 --> 44:18.451
Yeah man.

44:19.536 --> 44:21.621
I second that Jeffrey.

44:21.663 --> 44:22.956
Why four?

44:22.996 --> 44:24.581
There are five of us
at this table!

44:24.623 --> 44:27.125
What happens
to that one person?!

44:27.168 --> 44:29.211
Do any of
you know where you are?

44:29.253 --> 44:30.087
Hell.

44:32.005 --> 44:35.217
We're in hell.

44:35.218 --> 44:37.928
And Harry's in hell too,
that's for damn sure.

44:37.971 --> 44:39.137
Not knowing where you are

44:39.179 --> 44:42.182
is protection for the
one of you that survives.

44:42.224 --> 44:44.978
This is why we're masked.

44:45.018 --> 44:46.311
That way
we protect the survivor,

44:46.353 --> 44:48.355
the program, and the employees.

44:48.398 --> 44:49.606
Employees.

44:49.648 --> 44:52.402
Yeah shit,
I got the wrong fucking job.

44:52.443 --> 44:54.863
What's to prevent the
survivor from turning you in?

44:54.903 --> 44:56.322
We guarantee
he'll have a trip out

44:56.364 --> 44:58.615
to the ocean
and join the others.

44:58.657 --> 45:01.243
You are our 10th group
in eight years.

45:01.286 --> 45:04.664
Nine individuals that were chosen
previously have gone home.

45:04.706 --> 45:07.208
Not one of them has said a word.

45:07.250 --> 45:09.376
We have a small device
deep into the tissue

45:09.418 --> 45:11.045
of your body
that can be activated

45:11.086 --> 45:13.297
by us at any time.

45:13.338 --> 45:16.259
Does that answer
your question Arnold?

45:16.300 --> 45:18.677
Excuse me
Mr. Government executioner,

45:18.719 --> 45:22.973
but how will you choose this
survivor as you call it?

45:23.016 --> 45:25.268
You will Jaclyn.

45:25.309 --> 45:26.894
All of you will.

45:26.936 --> 45:28.855
That's why you needed to
get to know each other.

45:28.896 --> 45:33.442
So then maybe we should
all just draw straws then.

45:33.483 --> 45:34.818
No.

45:34.860 --> 45:36.320
We will be watching
for the reason

45:36.362 --> 45:39.865
why you decide to let that
person be set free from his sin.

45:39.907 --> 45:42.659
That is until judgment day.

45:42.702 --> 45:44.662
You have what's left
of your two hours.

45:47.916 --> 45:49.417
You're fucking kidding right?!

45:49.458 --> 45:51.668
What if we refuse
to choose someone?

45:51.710 --> 45:53.462
Then you will all die.

45:53.505 --> 45:55.088
That makes no sense.

45:55.130 --> 45:56.507
Why are you letting one of us go

45:56.548 --> 45:59.259
when according to you
we all deserve to die?

45:59.302 --> 46:01.137
I don't make the rules.

46:01.179 --> 46:03.472
You're not convinced.

46:03.514 --> 46:06.725
That sounds
very unprofessional of you.

46:06.768 --> 46:08.311
It doesn't
matter what I think Jaclyn.

46:08.353 --> 46:09.604
I'm obeying orders.

46:09.646 --> 46:12.315
You will choose someone or
they will all be executed.

46:12.356 --> 46:14.525
You want us to pardon someone!

46:14.567 --> 46:17.027
And your
decision must be unanimous.

46:35.547 --> 46:37.882
I suggest you enjoy this meal.

46:37.923 --> 46:40.342
Remember, the times right now.

47:01.989 --> 47:05.577
Come.

47:05.578 --> 47:07.328
Fuckers.

47:14.626 --> 47:16.378
Come sit down.

47:16.420 --> 47:17.838
Thank you Robby.

47:19.965 --> 47:21.592
Enjoy the meal.

47:21.634 --> 47:22.927
That's what he fucking said.

47:22.969 --> 47:24.887
He said enjoy the fucking meal.

47:25.762 --> 47:27.431
How's your arm Jeffrey?

47:27.472 --> 47:29.016
It fucking hurts.

47:29.851 --> 47:32.394
Yo, I really wanted to
fucking marry Gloria.

47:32.436 --> 47:34.980
Now I'm pissed because
I know that won't be me.

47:35.023 --> 47:37.483
Jeffrey,
why count yourself out?

47:37.525 --> 47:41.820
I told you, I felt it
when I woke up here okay.

47:41.862 --> 47:44.573
I had that dream remember?

47:44.615 --> 47:46.576
I didn't tell you guys
the whole thing.

47:46.617 --> 47:47.619
Shit.

47:47.659 --> 47:49.369
What are we gonna do?

47:53.458 --> 47:55.251
Eat.

47:55.293 --> 47:58.505
Y'all sitting there
and starve to death.

48:02.509 --> 48:03.342
Shrimp.

48:05.637 --> 48:06.763
Steak.

48:06.804 --> 48:07.639
Alright.

48:08.889 --> 48:10.349
Mashed potatoes.

48:11.559 --> 48:12.393
Broccoli.

48:14.811 --> 48:15.646
Well...

48:17.273 --> 48:19.442
You know, I don't understand.

48:19.483 --> 48:20.817
I don't understand,
y'all seem like

48:20.860 --> 48:22.070
decent enough people to me.

48:22.110 --> 48:24.029
Why anyone would wanna
hurt us I don't know.

48:24.072 --> 48:25.280
It's maniacal.

48:25.322 --> 48:26.865
It's bullshit professor.

48:26.907 --> 48:28.284
Well said.

48:28.326 --> 48:30.661
I don't know
how they expect us to eat.

48:30.702 --> 48:31.996
Harry was killed
right in front of us.

48:32.038 --> 48:34.456
Well, if this is my last meal,

48:34.498 --> 48:35.500
I'm gonna eat!

48:39.670 --> 48:41.255
I'm gonna eat too,
where's that fucking steak?

48:41.297 --> 48:42.673
Come everybody,
come eat something man.

48:42.715 --> 48:44.384
Stop it!

48:44.425 --> 48:46.052
Stop it goddammit!

48:46.094 --> 48:48.179
We're gonna die okay?

48:48.221 --> 48:53.684
Jokes and fucking fear
is all we have left okay?

48:53.685 --> 48:55.103
And I just decided right
after I'm done eating

48:55.143 --> 48:56.645
I'm gonna fucking escape.

48:56.688 --> 48:57.438
Jeffrey.

48:57.480 --> 48:58.773
You hear that?!

48:58.815 --> 49:02.693
I'm gonna fucking eat,
and then I'm gonna escape.

49:02.735 --> 49:04.403
Anyone wanna escape with me?

49:04.445 --> 49:07.448
Jeffrey come on, relax okay.

49:07.489 --> 49:08.991
I'll vote for you.

49:09.032 --> 49:10.117
Thanks.

49:10.159 --> 49:12.787
You know, you're fucking dope.

49:12.829 --> 49:14.455
Alright, down boy.

49:17.250 --> 49:18.543
That was sweet.

49:23.715 --> 49:24.716
You know what?

49:25.632 --> 49:28.093
I'm going to eat everything.

49:30.597 --> 49:32.724
Jeffrey just cheered me up.

49:37.728 --> 49:39.313
I have a question.

49:39.355 --> 49:40.856
They say we're criminals.

49:40.898 --> 49:42.817
Hey Robby what'd you do?

49:42.858 --> 49:43.610
What do you mean?

49:43.650 --> 49:44.943
Nothing.

49:44.985 --> 49:46.528
I mean I have forgotten
to expose a couple things

49:46.570 --> 49:47.905
to Uncle Sam but,

49:48.780 --> 49:50.824
it's a cash business,
it's not a big deal.

49:50.867 --> 49:52.619
Yeah, you see what they
do with your tax dollars?

49:52.659 --> 49:54.661
They fuck America.

49:54.704 --> 49:57.664
Everyone knows what I did.

49:57.706 --> 49:59.708
What about you Arnold.

49:59.751 --> 50:03.129
I can't think
of anything that bad.

50:03.170 --> 50:05.339
Are we being honest
with each other?

50:05.380 --> 50:06.673
Yes.

50:06.715 --> 50:07.967
I don't believe they
have such incriminating

50:08.009 --> 50:09.552
evidence from gadgets.

50:09.594 --> 50:11.887
No man they do.

50:11.929 --> 50:13.556
Ever since 9/11
they come out with

50:13.597 --> 50:16.058
all kind of electronic
mumbo jumbo things man.

50:16.099 --> 50:18.143
They have drones, GPS.

50:18.186 --> 50:20.480
They're in every house
in America.

50:20.521 --> 50:22.940
Big brother's watching
man, there are no secrets.

50:22.981 --> 50:25.192
Okay Robby,
what did they see you do?

50:25.235 --> 50:27.403
Did you drop someone
in the ocean?

50:27.445 --> 50:29.989
I don't know Jaclyn,
what did they see you do?

50:31.157 --> 50:31.908
What, you kill off
one of your clients

50:31.949 --> 50:34.076
for not paying his bill?

50:34.117 --> 50:38.373
I'm too smart to kill
someone that owed me money.

50:39.666 --> 50:40.625
Who did you really kill?

50:40.666 --> 50:41.668
You leave her alone.

50:41.708 --> 50:44.127
Now the professor
comes to life.

50:44.170 --> 50:46.630
Let's get back to it.

50:46.672 --> 50:48.590
Don't forget these
people haven't presented

50:48.632 --> 50:50.300
any proof at all that any of us

50:50.342 --> 50:52.177
are guilty of anything.

50:52.219 --> 50:53.971
I still can't believe
they left my purse.

50:54.012 --> 50:55.681
Exactly Jaclyn.

50:55.722 --> 50:57.599
On what basis
are we to decide which

50:57.641 --> 50:59.935
one of us goes free?

50:59.978 --> 51:02.188
Perhaps we should
take a preliminary vote

51:02.230 --> 51:03.356
and go from there.

51:03.398 --> 51:04.524
Why the fuck
are we letting these

51:04.565 --> 51:08.820
fucks tell us what to do?

51:08.821 --> 51:10.113
If we're gonna die,

51:10.153 --> 51:12.155
then we might as well
just fucking die together.

51:12.197 --> 51:13.449
Okay, fuck 'em.

51:13.490 --> 51:15.742
Wait, is that what
everyone wants to do?

51:15.784 --> 51:16.536
Die together?

51:16.577 --> 51:18.036
I'm willing to choose someone.

51:18.079 --> 51:18.830
Why not?

51:18.871 --> 51:20.664
Okay fuck it.

51:20.706 --> 51:21.915
What are the rules.

51:21.958 --> 51:24.418
No, they're
more like guidelines.

51:24.460 --> 51:26.795
We wanna share
more about our lives.

51:26.838 --> 51:28.965
There goes votes for me.

51:29.007 --> 51:31.175
Why, I'd vote for you.

51:31.217 --> 51:33.552
You've probably brought
more joy to this world

51:33.594 --> 51:38.599
than all of us combined.

51:38.600 --> 51:41.351
Yeah, Harry would
agree to that.

51:48.525 --> 51:52.237
I really wish Harry
could second that.

51:52.280 --> 51:54.699
Yeah well, I'll do it for him.

51:54.740 --> 51:56.826
Obviously Harry
was a murderer.

51:56.867 --> 51:57.744
No question.

51:57.784 --> 51:58.661
His poor wife.

51:58.702 --> 52:00.079
That was so cruel.

52:00.121 --> 52:02.081
I think he deserved it.

52:03.666 --> 52:04.667
To die I mean.

52:05.710 --> 52:08.670
Yes, but most murderers
aren't executed.

52:08.713 --> 52:10.507
What they are doing here to us
is wrong

52:10.547 --> 52:11.965
on so many levels.

52:13.425 --> 52:15.427
Harry could have been
legally out of his mind.

52:15.469 --> 52:17.262
He was out of his mind.

52:17.304 --> 52:20.641
But you know,
now that I think about it,

52:20.682 --> 52:22.643
the rat deserved to die.

52:22.684 --> 52:24.228
Because
he lusted after you?

52:24.269 --> 52:25.771
Hell no!

52:25.813 --> 52:27.273
He should have been
roasted for what

52:27.315 --> 52:29.067
he did to his wife!

52:29.108 --> 52:30.985
Now that's cruel.

52:31.027 --> 52:32.487
You sound like these people.

52:32.528 --> 52:34.905
Some people ought to die.

52:34.947 --> 52:36.281
That's my opinion okay.

52:36.324 --> 52:37.115
Ladies.

52:38.492 --> 52:40.494
Sorry, I just have
to think like a lawyer.

52:40.536 --> 52:42.329
People, we're
running out of time.

52:42.371 --> 52:45.207
On what basis
are going to do this?

52:45.250 --> 52:47.668
I have a confession to make.

52:49.878 --> 52:52.632
I have a problem with my anger.

52:55.175 --> 52:58.096
I can't control it sometimes.

52:58.137 --> 52:59.681
I don't know where it comes from

52:59.722 --> 53:01.432
and I don't know why.

53:04.476 --> 53:05.936
It makes me insane.

53:12.110 --> 53:14.695
I needed something
to calm my nerves

53:14.737 --> 53:16.822
so I started to play cards.

53:21.702 --> 53:24.706
See I have
an addiction to like Harry.

53:26.583 --> 53:28.543
Except mine's gambling.

53:31.795 --> 53:35.175
Lost my boat last year.

53:35.176 --> 53:37.510
Along with my woman.

53:37.552 --> 53:40.471
Have you ever
been tested for PTSD?

53:50.731 --> 53:52.733
My sanity
is being tested here!

53:52.775 --> 53:56.778
Have any of you people
ever read the constitution?!

54:00.157 --> 54:02.868
All is fair in love and war.

54:02.911 --> 54:04.829
That's what they say.

54:16.132 --> 54:18.510
I say we all get out
of this by being smart.

54:18.550 --> 54:20.636
What do you say Victoria?

54:23.056 --> 54:24.264
Smart is good.

54:26.016 --> 54:29.853
You know your broccoli
looks better than mine.

54:29.896 --> 54:30.939
Can I try it?

54:30.980 --> 54:31.773
Of course.

54:41.074 --> 54:45.327
You have just a little
broccoli right there.

54:45.369 --> 54:46.411
Thanks.

54:58.048 --> 54:58.842
Take them...

54:58.882 --> 55:01.051
You know, I really wish

55:01.094 --> 55:03.972
we had met
under different circumstances.

55:04.012 --> 55:04.847
So do I.

55:09.226 --> 55:11.855
Excuse me, does anybody
mind bringing me

55:11.896 --> 55:14.774
some of that steak and
a knife to cut it with?

55:14.815 --> 55:15.732
Allow me.

55:27.077 --> 55:27.829
There you are.

55:27.871 --> 55:30.123
Thank you very much Arnold.

55:33.960 --> 55:37.045
Aren't we all hungry
for a little more steak?

55:37.088 --> 55:39.048
Yeah I'm starved.

55:39.090 --> 55:41.509
I'm hungry, yeah.

55:42.677 --> 55:45.722
Yeah man,
I'm gonna get some more.

55:58.108 --> 56:01.945
Robby which branch
did you serve?

56:01.987 --> 56:05.074
The Corps.

56:05.075 --> 56:07.076
That must've been tough.

56:10.121 --> 56:11.539
Do you need a napkin?

56:11.581 --> 56:12.414
Yeah.

56:15.083 --> 56:15.918
Thank you.

56:29.974 --> 56:31.643
It's diabolical.

56:32.601 --> 56:35.730
I feel like I'm
in a Stephen King movie.

56:35.771 --> 56:37.981
What do you mean?

56:38.023 --> 56:41.277
We wake incarcerated,

56:41.278 --> 56:44.155
tied to our chairs,
masked men tell us

56:44.197 --> 56:46.032
that we're all
condemned to death

56:46.074 --> 56:48.909
and that we'll be
eliminated by tonight.

56:48.952 --> 56:52.080
Masked men with guns pointed
to the back of our heads.

56:52.121 --> 56:53.039
It's horror.

56:53.081 --> 56:55.166
Then they give us
coffee and donuts.

56:55.208 --> 56:57.168
Dinner?!

56:57.169 --> 56:59.878
We're here
because of some secret funded

56:59.920 --> 57:02.130
government program
designed to cut deficit.

57:02.172 --> 57:04.132
This is an all new
kind of horror.

57:04.175 --> 57:05.927
No Robby, it's only new to us.

57:05.969 --> 57:07.804
In other countries they
kill anybody they want

57:07.846 --> 57:09.304
any time they want.

57:09.347 --> 57:10.181
Wait.

57:10.222 --> 57:12.182
I do have a point here.

57:13.393 --> 57:16.396
Now they become
even more contemptible

57:16.436 --> 57:20.023
by asking us to
choose someone to go free.

57:20.065 --> 57:21.608
One person to live.

57:23.152 --> 57:25.947
And I'm assuming that
none of us wants to die.

57:25.989 --> 57:27.532
And by voting
for that one person

57:27.574 --> 57:29.909
we're condemning ourselves.

57:29.951 --> 57:32.119
That's why
they didn't untie us.

57:32.161 --> 57:33.996
What are you saying?

57:35.789 --> 57:39.210
They could have
easily untied us right?

57:39.251 --> 57:41.003
When the gunned men came in

57:41.045 --> 57:45.633
it was as if they had planned
it that way, you know?

57:45.675 --> 57:48.219
That we would untie each other.

57:49.637 --> 57:51.681
I don't get it either.

57:52.431 --> 57:54.391
They wanted us to bond.

57:54.434 --> 57:55.852
Right.

57:55.893 --> 57:57.144
You understand this?

57:57.186 --> 57:59.813
Look, remember he said

57:59.856 --> 58:03.234
that it was very important
that we get to know each other.

58:03.275 --> 58:04.027
See?

58:04.068 --> 58:05.111
No.

58:05.152 --> 58:08.197
They want us to feel
empathy for each other.

58:08.239 --> 58:09.657
We were in the same danger

58:09.699 --> 58:12.619
and we had to help each other.

58:12.659 --> 58:14.203
That's the spirit I think of how

58:14.244 --> 58:16.830
they want us to look at this.

58:17.664 --> 58:21.085
Not us condemning ourselves.

58:21.086 --> 58:23.963
But us helping someone else out.

58:25.088 --> 58:26.215
Respect.

58:26.257 --> 58:27.550
Yeah, fucking respect.

58:27.592 --> 58:29.260
You're saying that they're

58:29.302 --> 58:31.554
giving a group
of condemned criminals

58:31.596 --> 58:35.391
a chance to do something
good for someone else?

58:35.432 --> 58:36.266
Yes.

58:37.518 --> 58:40.062
Okay, well we set
someone free and...

58:40.103 --> 58:44.399
And acts as a counter
element to implicit justice.

58:44.442 --> 58:46.652
It's justice softened by mercy.

58:46.693 --> 58:47.903
I'm not buying it.

58:47.945 --> 58:50.239
These people
are ruthless killers.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.199
No, no, no, no.

58:52.242 --> 58:55.119
No, setting one person free?

58:55.161 --> 58:56.621
Man that sound
just like what some

58:56.663 --> 58:59.081
bastard bureaucrat would
do soften their conscious.

58:59.123 --> 59:00.625
Yes, they need that,
but these people

59:00.666 --> 59:02.460
are murderers themselves
on an illegal,

59:02.501 --> 59:04.503
unconstitutional program that no

59:04.545 --> 59:07.172
congressman or senator
would ever approve of.

59:07.215 --> 59:09.217
Well they wouldn't have to.

59:09.259 --> 59:11.135
It'd be buried
inside some huge bill

59:11.177 --> 59:13.012
that no one took the time
to read.

59:13.054 --> 59:14.012
They can do that?

59:14.054 --> 59:16.056
They could, they did.

59:16.099 --> 59:18.268
They did,
it was all in the news.

59:18.309 --> 59:22.063
They passed some
new funding bill right?

59:22.105 --> 59:24.273
But attached to it was some
new gun thing a gun law

59:24.315 --> 59:26.150
that no one saw coming.

59:26.192 --> 59:28.862
And no one knows
where it comes from.

59:28.902 --> 59:30.904
They hid it from us,
and now it's a law,

59:30.947 --> 59:32.490
that's what this is.

59:32.532 --> 59:34.242
So this could be real?

59:34.284 --> 59:35.617
This could be
some new fucking law,

59:35.659 --> 59:37.119
some new government
fucking program?

59:37.161 --> 59:40.206
And what you're saying
is that we're fucked?

59:40.248 --> 59:41.331
That's what you just said.

59:41.373 --> 59:44.501
You basically
just said we're fucked.

59:44.543 --> 59:45.920
Yeah man.

59:45.961 --> 59:47.963
There has to be more to it.

59:48.005 --> 59:49.298
I'm a lawyer, I'm telling you,

59:49.340 --> 59:52.343
there's always more things
to it than you think.

59:52.385 --> 59:54.137
You're saying he lied?

59:54.179 --> 59:54.971
No.

59:55.012 --> 59:57.139
He just didn't say it all.

59:57.181 --> 59:58.765
You know
if you're right Victoria,

59:58.807 --> 01:00:00.851
if there is some
glimmer of humanity

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:03.645
or mercy
in this hideous program,

01:00:03.688 --> 01:00:06.273
that there is more to it
than we know.

01:00:06.315 --> 01:00:07.232
I don't know.

01:00:07.275 --> 01:00:08.108
Look,

01:00:09.193 --> 01:00:12.447
what if we unanimously
choose each other?

01:00:12.487 --> 01:00:14.323
Five votes, five times,

01:00:14.364 --> 01:00:16.783
and on each vote
we are unanimous.

01:00:16.826 --> 01:00:18.327
Okay now I don't get it.

01:00:18.369 --> 01:00:20.579
That won't work.

01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:23.750
I'm just using this
as an example Arnold.

01:00:23.791 --> 01:00:26.961
Remember, he didn't give
us any rules to go by.

01:00:27.003 --> 01:00:29.713
There are no guidelines.

01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:31.715
We tell them
we are unanimous five times

01:00:31.757 --> 01:00:33.884
and he has to let us all go.

01:00:33.927 --> 01:00:36.387
He don't have to do nothing.

01:00:36.429 --> 01:00:37.764
If this really
is a government program

01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:39.598
then we do have rights.

01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:41.351
One is the right
to convene as a jury

01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:43.310
for a specific goal.

01:00:43.353 --> 01:00:45.563
And we also have the right
to speak freely

01:00:45.605 --> 01:00:48.565
to one another and to them
as we've already seen.

01:00:48.608 --> 01:00:51.568
That means to some extent
we can make a defense!

01:00:57.742 --> 01:00:58.952
They're listening.

01:00:58.992 --> 01:01:01.161
Come on, let's fight back.

01:01:02.246 --> 01:01:04.248
I still say
that we take a vote

01:01:04.289 --> 01:01:06.375
and really choose someone.

01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:08.545
Based on what Arnold?

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:11.505
How about how we really
feel about each other?

01:01:11.547 --> 01:01:13.423
That's the problem.

01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:16.802
I can't pick one of you
over the other.

01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:19.847
That's sweet.

01:01:19.848 --> 01:01:21.266
Don't choose me.

01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:23.851
Because I for real,

01:01:27.646 --> 01:01:29.023
I'm a murderer.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.278
And like Victoria said,

01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:37.907
some people should die.

01:01:41.661 --> 01:01:43.288
My crime was simple.

01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:48.418
I came home,

01:01:51.461 --> 01:01:55.257
and I found my woman in
bed with my best friend.

01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:01.722
Come over here.

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.020
Come on, listen, come
on let's talk this out.

01:02:08.061 --> 01:02:09.855
This was a mistake.

01:02:09.898 --> 01:02:12.733
I saw
nothing but black.

01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:17.237
We'd never do anything
to hurt you.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.281
We'd never do...

01:02:18.322 --> 01:02:20.782
What you doing?

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:21.701
What you doing man?

01:02:21.742 --> 01:02:23.619
Come on man, what you doing?!

01:02:23.661 --> 01:02:27.331
I grabbed my pistol.

01:02:33.463 --> 01:02:35.673
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:39.969 --> 01:02:40.802
Baby.

01:02:43.722 --> 01:02:44.974
Say something.

01:02:47.518 --> 01:02:48.393
Come on baby.

01:03:01.114 --> 01:03:03.033
And I shot them both.

01:03:06.538 --> 01:03:08.331
Right there on the spot.

01:03:11.751 --> 01:03:15.463
Even though they had both
got down on their knees and

01:03:15.505 --> 01:03:16.798
begged me not to.

01:03:24.806 --> 01:03:26.432
I still had my boat.

01:03:30.519 --> 01:03:34.273
So I took their bodies
out to the sea

01:03:34.315 --> 01:03:35.733
and I cut them up.

01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:43.657
And I tossed them
out to the sharks.

01:03:43.699 --> 01:03:46.243
Was there an investigation?

01:03:47.202 --> 01:03:50.539
I told the police that
they had left town together.

01:03:50.581 --> 01:03:52.166
That his wife and

01:03:53.835 --> 01:03:56.670
my mother-in-law off my back.

01:03:56.713 --> 01:03:58.590
Got away with the whole thing.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:02.384
But these people must have
something 'cause they know.

01:04:02.427 --> 01:04:03.260
They know.

01:04:15.481 --> 01:04:17.567
I'm ready to make amends

01:04:17.608 --> 01:04:19.360
for what I have done.

01:04:25.282 --> 01:04:27.492
I'll take the first one out.

01:04:31.623 --> 01:04:34.708
Send someone in,
we've made our choice!

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:46.012
Where is she?

01:04:46.054 --> 01:04:47.305
Where is she?!

01:04:50.641 --> 01:04:53.644
My bullet is faster
than your knife.

01:04:55.646 --> 01:04:56.523
Jaclyn right?

01:04:57.856 --> 01:04:59.442
Let me introduce myself.

01:04:59.483 --> 01:05:02.569
I'm Charlie, I run this program.

01:05:02.612 --> 01:05:05.030
And you are messing things up.

01:05:08.451 --> 01:05:12.621
Look at this.

01:05:13.498 --> 01:05:15.583
My god.

01:05:15.625 --> 01:05:16.751
Stay with us.

01:05:18.085 --> 01:05:21.588
Robby come on,
stay with us, stay with us.

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:22.673
Come on, you can do it.

01:05:22.715 --> 01:05:24.509
Wherever you are.

01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:25.634
No, stay with us.

01:05:25.677 --> 01:05:27.679
They can't do this to you.

01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:29.429
Now I'm finally free.

01:05:33.684 --> 01:05:36.436
They can't do this to you.

01:05:36.478 --> 01:05:37.312
No.

01:05:47.739 --> 01:05:51.034
Your stupid little note
just got Robby killed.

01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:52.662
This woman over here
has managed to

01:05:52.704 --> 01:05:54.289
get another one of you killed.

01:05:54.329 --> 01:05:55.539
Don't be stupid.

01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:59.085
Time's running out.

01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:02.963
Make a decision.

01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:16.686
Like I said,
we're all gonna die.

01:06:16.728 --> 01:06:18.563
Arnold are you okay?

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:23.025
My heart won't stop pounding.

01:06:23.067 --> 01:06:25.485
We understand honey.

01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:27.112
I'm a professor.

01:06:27.155 --> 01:06:31.701
I've never shot a gun I've
never even had a fight.

01:06:31.742 --> 01:06:34.203
I'm sorry I didn't help you.

01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:39.458
We wouldn't have made
it halfway down the hall.

01:06:40.418 --> 01:06:48.384
I think better on my feet.

01:06:48.385 --> 01:06:50.719
I'm sorry about Robby.

01:06:50.762 --> 01:06:53.681
But I put my life out there
with him.

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:55.141
You're so brave.

01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:59.144
I'm sorry I didn't help.

01:06:59.186 --> 01:07:00.771
I just couldn't fucking move.

01:07:00.813 --> 01:07:02.565
It happened so fast I,

01:07:02.606 --> 01:07:05.985
I don't know how
I got under the table.

01:07:06.027 --> 01:07:07.987
Let's move on.

01:07:08.028 --> 01:07:09.572
We have to accept

01:07:10.614 --> 01:07:14.993
that only one of us
will walk out of here.

01:07:15.036 --> 01:07:17.371
And after what you
just tried to do Jaclyn

01:07:17.413 --> 01:07:19.541
I think that should be you.

01:07:21.251 --> 01:07:22.585
No.

01:07:22.626 --> 01:07:24.461
Let's figure this out.

01:07:25.547 --> 01:07:27.757
I'd like to start
with saying that...

01:07:27.798 --> 01:07:29.967
No, don't say another word.

01:07:30.009 --> 01:07:33.596
They say we're all murderers
and we all deserve to die.

01:07:33.637 --> 01:07:35.806
How should we judge each other?

01:07:35.849 --> 01:07:38.101
Based on how many
people we killed?

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:40.686
Or heads we've cut off
or bodies we've buried?

01:07:40.728 --> 01:07:42.563
What an appalling idea.

01:07:42.605 --> 01:07:46.233
Okay, I just say we go
with our gut feelings okay.

01:07:46.275 --> 01:07:47.902
The vibes we all got
from each other.

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:50.905
I still say we shouldn't
play this game.

01:07:50.947 --> 01:07:52.740
We have four voting sessions

01:07:52.782 --> 01:07:55.535
and each one one of us survives.

01:07:55.577 --> 01:07:58.371
In each one one of us wins.

01:07:58.413 --> 01:08:00.706
When they come in here
we tell them

01:08:00.748 --> 01:08:04.793
we all voted, we voted
for all of us to survive.

01:08:07.213 --> 01:08:08.840
That's brilliant.

01:08:08.882 --> 01:08:12.217
Yes, we've got
something to fight back.

01:08:13.469 --> 01:08:15.430
But also merciful.

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:16.846
I like it.

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:18.307
Do we all agree?

01:08:21.185 --> 01:08:22.144
Good.

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:24.189
Now to make this
as official as possible,

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:26.064
who do we wanna chair?

01:08:27.024 --> 01:08:28.399
That's easy.

01:08:28.443 --> 01:08:29.694
We'd be stupid not to let the

01:08:29.734 --> 01:08:31.863
one lawyer among us
make our case.

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:33.863
Yeah, she's got my vote.

01:08:33.907 --> 01:08:35.573
Okay.

01:08:35.617 --> 01:08:36.908
Well let's start.

01:08:37.993 --> 01:08:41.662
I just saw my whole life
rush behind me.

01:08:41.706 --> 01:08:43.372
There's always hope Jeffrey.

01:08:43.416 --> 01:08:44.207
A hope?

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.710
Yeah okay,
I was born under a rock

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:48.046
that never got moved.

01:08:48.087 --> 01:08:50.215
Okay let's vote.

01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:52.591
Let's begin with Victoria.

01:08:52.634 --> 01:08:55.176
All those in favor
of Victoria being

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.346
the one raise your hands.

01:08:59.305 --> 01:09:00.557
It is decided.

01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:05.770
Now, all those in favor
of Jeffrey being the one,

01:09:05.813 --> 01:09:07.356
raise your hands.

01:09:11.653 --> 01:09:14.363
Think, don't screw up
the plan.

01:09:16.865 --> 01:09:18.326
It is decided.

01:09:20.078 --> 01:09:22.705
Now, all those
in favor of Arnold

01:09:22.747 --> 01:09:25.625
being the one, raise your hands.

01:09:27.335 --> 01:09:29.212
It is decided.

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:31.337
Now all those
in favor of me Jaclyn

01:09:31.381 --> 01:09:34.926
being the one to survive,
raise your hands.

01:09:37.176 --> 01:09:38.429
It is decided.

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:42.015
Now, all those
in favor of getting

01:09:42.057 --> 01:09:43.643
out of here alive.

01:09:45.103 --> 01:09:48.898
I can't take
much more of this!

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:50.107
Hit it boys!

01:09:53.069 --> 01:09:54.654
What do ya think
you're doing now

01:09:54.695 --> 01:09:56.363
Making a fucking
defense for ourselves!

01:09:56.405 --> 01:09:57.323
Jeffrey, let me
do the talking.

01:09:57.364 --> 01:09:59.658
We are exercising
our legal rights!

01:09:59.701 --> 01:10:00.868
Yeah, what about the
rights of those people

01:10:00.909 --> 01:10:01.911
that you had killed?

01:10:01.953 --> 01:10:03.538
I did not kill anyone.

01:10:03.579 --> 01:10:05.122
You're a liar!

01:10:05.163 --> 01:10:07.332
I was acquitted,
found innocent!

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:08.877
Bringing me here
is a violation of my

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:10.545
5th amendment rights!

01:10:10.587 --> 01:10:11.337
Yeah?

01:10:11.378 --> 01:10:13.088
You have no rights sweetheart.

01:10:13.131 --> 01:10:16.967
I fucking knew it!

01:10:16.968 --> 01:10:18.720
Sit down!

01:10:20.555 --> 01:10:21.847
You killed him!

01:10:23.557 --> 01:10:25.601
One more chance

01:10:25.643 --> 01:10:27.270
or you'll all die!

01:10:27.311 --> 01:10:28.645
Especially you.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:36.988
This can't be done.

01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:38.197
Yeah?

01:10:38.238 --> 01:10:41.533
Well I wanna live.

01:10:41.534 --> 01:10:45.537
How about you Victoria,
you wanna live?

01:10:45.579 --> 01:10:46.413
Me?

01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:53.086
I was one step away from
going off a bridge last week.

01:10:53.128 --> 01:10:55.006
Look, like I said before,

01:10:55.047 --> 01:10:57.132
we should take
a preliminary vote.

01:10:57.175 --> 01:10:59.302
Okay, so fucking do it.

01:11:00.345 --> 01:11:02.930
Right, Jaclyn.

01:11:02.931 --> 01:11:03.972
You do it.

01:11:05.891 --> 01:11:07.809
Okay, let's
start with Victoria.

01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:08.685
Shit.

01:11:09.979 --> 01:11:12.148
Don't give me the hope.

01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:14.149
I vote for her.

01:11:14.192 --> 01:11:16.528
Jeffrey.

01:11:16.569 --> 01:11:20.114
Look okay sure, I
wanna fucking live okay.

01:11:20.155 --> 01:11:21.990
But I know what I did.

01:11:25.286 --> 01:11:26.663
You hear that?!

01:11:27.412 --> 01:11:29.665
I know what I fucking did!

01:11:30.707 --> 01:11:32.626
Alright, so it's one vote
for Victoria.

01:11:32.668 --> 01:11:35.087
Now Jeffrey are you still out?

01:11:36.881 --> 01:11:38.216
Yeah.

01:11:38.257 --> 01:11:40.009
Yeah I gotta face it.

01:11:40.885 --> 01:11:45.014
That's really admirable
of you Jeffrey.

01:11:45.055 --> 01:11:46.974
I'm proud of you.

01:11:47.015 --> 01:11:48.851
Okay, moving on.

01:11:48.893 --> 01:11:50.645
Who votes for Jaclyn?

01:11:56.734 --> 01:11:58.987
So, one vote for Victoria
and one vote for Jaclyn.

01:11:59.028 --> 01:11:59.945
Who votes for me?

01:11:59.988 --> 01:12:02.240
One vote for me, so, look.

01:12:03.658 --> 01:12:05.451
You guys, it took me eight years

01:12:05.493 --> 01:12:07.203
to get my Doctorate.

01:12:07.244 --> 01:12:08.954
We both help people out.

01:12:08.997 --> 01:12:12.250
I've gotten 100 people
off that I've represented.

01:12:12.292 --> 01:12:14.669
Including yourself?

01:12:14.711 --> 01:12:17.463
I was tried
and found innocent.

01:12:19.006 --> 01:12:20.257
Let's be real.

01:12:21.509 --> 01:12:25.430
Is there any hope of us
agreeing on the same person?

01:12:28.975 --> 01:12:29.809
Alright.

01:12:50.121 --> 01:12:52.498
Just wanted to talk to him.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.793
Okay?

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:06.346
Bring me a copy of that goddamn
law that brought us here.

01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:07.679
No.

01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:09.224
I will not.

01:13:09.265 --> 01:13:11.184
This is unbelievable.

01:13:12.351 --> 01:13:14.354
Have you no conscience?

01:13:14.395 --> 01:13:16.481
More than you have sweetheart.

01:13:16.523 --> 01:13:17.940
And now you're gonna
pay for your gross

01:13:17.981 --> 01:13:20.484
disrespect for human rights.

01:13:20.527 --> 01:13:23.654
There has to be something
you can do to help us.

01:13:23.695 --> 01:13:26.282
Each of us has
a lot to live for!

01:13:26.323 --> 01:13:29.117
But why save someone anyway?

01:13:29.159 --> 01:13:32.956
If we all supposed to
repentant killers why?

01:13:32.997 --> 01:13:35.875
Yeah I second that question.

01:13:35.917 --> 01:13:37.335
The designers of this law

01:13:37.377 --> 01:13:41.297
favor the Biblical law
of an eye for an eye.

01:13:41.338 --> 01:13:42.756
The hope was that you as a group

01:13:42.798 --> 01:13:45.801
could see the justice
in your own execution.

01:13:45.844 --> 01:13:48.179
And as one final act of goodness

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.097
show some mercy
to someone who would

01:13:50.139 --> 01:13:53.059
never repeat his crime.

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.019
You get it?

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:56.604
But it looks like
this group doesn't

01:13:56.645 --> 01:14:02.234
grasp the concept of mercy.

01:14:02.235 --> 01:14:04.988
But there is a plan B.

01:14:04.989 --> 01:14:08.283
So please go back to your
table and think deeply

01:14:08.323 --> 01:14:11.368
about what you did that none
of you have confessed to.

01:14:11.411 --> 01:14:14.663
Then maybe
we can have a conversation.

01:14:23.131 --> 01:14:26.801
Victoria was right,
this is about mercy.

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.013
And death.

01:14:58.207 --> 01:15:02.127
It is said that confession
is good for the soul.

01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:04.380
Let's say we have playback boys.

01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:05.255
Okay boys.

01:15:11.136 --> 01:15:12.889
I encourage all of you
to be as thorough

01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:14.223
and as honest as you can be.

01:15:14.265 --> 01:15:15.767
Because that is the criteria
in which

01:15:15.807 --> 01:15:18.853
you will all be judged by.

01:15:18.854 --> 01:15:22.189
Who would like to go first?

01:15:22.190 --> 01:15:24.024
Okay Jeffrey.

01:15:24.067 --> 01:15:25.234
Okay remember,

01:15:25.275 --> 01:15:29.113
we have undisputable
proof of all your crimes.

01:15:31.407 --> 01:15:35.662
I guess Harry didn't see
the drone above him?

01:15:37.747 --> 01:15:41.125
I guess Harry thought
he got away with it.

01:15:41.167 --> 01:15:42.627
Our committee
had no problem deciding

01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:44.503
what to do with Harry.

01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:48.006
He was killed as an example.

01:15:49.676 --> 01:15:51.803
Another example is Robby.

01:15:52.761 --> 01:15:56.099
Robby wasn't just
a degenerate gambler.

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.307
He was into running drugs for a

01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:59.269
fairly large syndicate
who was suspicious

01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:01.145
that he was skimming money.

01:16:01.186 --> 01:16:03.398
Feds bugged his house.

01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:05.441
The DNA backed up his story.

01:16:05.483 --> 01:16:07.944
Looks like Robby was honest.

01:16:07.985 --> 01:16:10.613
And that would have
put him in the running.

01:16:10.654 --> 01:16:12.072
But he's dead now.

01:16:13.658 --> 01:16:15.952
Okay Jeffrey, what's your story?

01:16:15.993 --> 01:16:17.119
Just remember to give me

01:16:17.161 --> 01:16:19.288
as much detail
as possible because

01:16:19.329 --> 01:16:21.623
your life could depend on it.

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.812
I killed my mom and dad.

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:44.605
Why?

01:16:45.899 --> 01:16:47.400
Why the fuck not?

01:16:48.359 --> 01:16:51.196
There was a bank
transfer to your account.

01:16:51.237 --> 01:16:52.447
Yeah.

01:16:52.488 --> 01:16:54.199
Yeah my dad won 50 grand in Keno

01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:57.284
and wouldn't give me
20 fucking dollars.

01:16:57.327 --> 01:16:59.162
I took the fucking money.

01:16:59.203 --> 01:17:01.371
How'd you kill them?

01:17:01.413 --> 01:17:02.206
Easily.

01:17:05.918 --> 01:17:09.963
And then you
disposed of the bodies?

01:17:12.716 --> 01:17:15.469
You couldn't have found them.

01:17:15.511 --> 01:17:18.430
Nobody could have
fucking found them.

01:17:19.224 --> 01:17:20.975
I guess there
is no other family members

01:17:21.016 --> 01:17:23.310
left to worry about then?

01:17:23.353 --> 01:17:26.940
Yeah, I was still cashing
their social security checks.

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.608
Had it fucking made.

01:17:31.235 --> 01:17:32.945
Up until Gloria.

01:17:32.987 --> 01:17:34.113
No.

01:17:34.154 --> 01:17:35.239
Is that why
you killed Gloria?

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.615
No okay, that wasn't
my fucking fault!

01:17:36.658 --> 01:17:39.327
Jeffrey, is
that why you killed Gloria?

01:17:39.368 --> 01:17:40.786
No, fuck you!

01:17:40.828 --> 01:17:42.956
That wasn't my fault!

01:17:42.997 --> 01:17:43.831
Fuck you!

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:49.671
Jeffrey don't
do it, don't do it no!

01:17:54.425 --> 01:17:57.302
Lock this damn door!

01:17:57.303 --> 01:18:00.055
You people
are a difficult group.

01:18:01.682 --> 01:18:04.060
Okay, who wants to go next?

01:18:07.855 --> 01:18:09.314
Victoria.

01:18:09.356 --> 01:18:11.442
Let me just say,
that Jeffrey wouldn't

01:18:11.484 --> 01:18:13.945
have been chosen by our program.

01:18:13.987 --> 01:18:17.407
He left out quite a bit
of detail about his story.

01:18:17.448 --> 01:18:20.535
Including the death of
his younger brother.

01:18:20.577 --> 01:18:22.412
His younger brother?

01:18:25.414 --> 01:18:27.207
Do you people really know
these so called details

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:29.210
or are you just bluffing?

01:18:29.252 --> 01:18:33.089
I took you for being a lot
smarter than that Jaclyn.

01:18:33.131 --> 01:18:36.759
The nickname of our
program is The Eyes Of God.

01:18:36.801 --> 01:18:41.055
You can't even imagine how
far technology has taken us.

01:18:41.847 --> 01:18:43.640
Know what I mean?

01:18:43.682 --> 01:18:47.395
Victoria, come on.

01:18:47.396 --> 01:18:49.439
Tell us the truth.

01:18:49.479 --> 01:18:51.440
I wanna hear it.

01:18:51.481 --> 01:18:53.109
Right?

01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:54.903
We all wanna hear it.

01:19:12.462 --> 01:19:16.216
First of all I have
to be honest and say,

01:19:17.966 --> 01:19:31.689
I don't regret killing Val.

01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:34.442
He also cut me
across my stomach,

01:19:34.484 --> 01:19:38.154
my buttock, and took my nipples.

01:19:38.155 --> 01:19:40.615
He tortured me for the rights

01:19:40.657 --> 01:19:43.117
to my movie residuals
because Johnny

01:19:43.158 --> 01:19:45.827
had producer backed by the mob

01:19:45.869 --> 01:19:48.331
that I was getting
too much money.

01:19:48.372 --> 01:19:50.457
You turned him in

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.417
Yes.

01:19:52.418 --> 01:19:56.296
Of course Johnny gave
him an airtight alibi.

01:19:56.338 --> 01:19:58.882
So you took your revenge?

01:19:58.925 --> 01:20:00.051
Damn right!

01:20:01.511 --> 01:20:04.556
Motherfucker deserved it.

01:20:04.596 --> 01:20:07.474
I followed him
and then one night

01:20:07.516 --> 01:20:09.018
I ran over his ass.

01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:20.195
I tied him
to the back of my car,

01:20:20.238 --> 01:20:21.280
dragged him,

01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:25.534
and took him into the woods.

01:20:26.493 --> 01:20:28.704
I burned his body up good.

01:20:28.746 --> 01:20:30.373
No one knew a thing.

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:35.170
The FBI knew.

01:20:36.462 --> 01:20:37.922
We tied it in
with the police report

01:20:37.963 --> 01:20:39.381
you made against Val.

01:20:39.423 --> 01:20:41.676
He got what he deserved.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.972
I got nothing else to say.

01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:53.604
Do what you want with me.

01:20:55.398 --> 01:20:57.233
You sure about that?

01:20:58.609 --> 01:20:59.902
What?

01:20:59.944 --> 01:21:02.572
What about
his one month old son?

01:21:02.613 --> 01:21:03.989
He had a son?

01:21:05.449 --> 01:21:07.202
What about it?

01:21:07.243 --> 01:21:08.578
The surveillance tape revealed

01:21:08.619 --> 01:21:11.831
there was a baby boy
under the car.

01:21:11.872 --> 01:21:14.125
I guess you never saw him.

01:21:15.835 --> 01:21:19.547
They didn't care
about the mobster.

01:21:19.588 --> 01:21:22.341
The baby boy
was buried as a John Doe.

01:21:24.426 --> 01:21:27.137
Something more
you wanna tell me?

01:21:29.056 --> 01:21:31.350
There's a baby
on the side of the road.

01:21:31.391 --> 01:21:32.894
He's not breathing.

01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:36.022
I don't know, somewhere.

01:21:36.064 --> 01:21:38.608
There's a run down gas station.

01:21:40.818 --> 01:21:43.655
Please come quickly,
he's not breathing.

01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:54.831
Voice recognition
of the 911 call

01:21:54.873 --> 01:21:57.335
reveals it was you Victoria.

01:21:58.127 --> 01:22:02.090
I heard something come
up from under the car.

01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:08.054
I couldn't imagine.

01:22:08.095 --> 01:22:11.181
I couldn't imagine what it was.

01:22:11.224 --> 01:22:12.851
Why didn't you tell us?

01:22:12.891 --> 01:22:20.440
How could anybody
admit to such a thing?

01:22:20.441 --> 01:22:21.525
My life's over.

01:22:23.485 --> 01:22:24.570
I believe so.

01:22:28.032 --> 01:22:31.828
Peter Stanford was one
of my freshman students.

01:22:31.869 --> 01:22:34.663
He came to me shortly
after class had started

01:22:34.706 --> 01:22:37.208
and threatened
to expose me if I didn't

01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:39.668
pay him a great deal of money.

01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:42.337
So I killed him.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:43.631
Do you think the Dean's
gonna like it

01:22:43.672 --> 01:22:44.506
when I go tell him about you?!

01:22:44.548 --> 01:22:45.716
I bet he's not gonna like that!

01:22:45.757 --> 01:22:46.675
You son of a bitch!

01:22:46.717 --> 01:22:47.635
I will kill you!

01:22:47.676 --> 01:22:48.719
Yeah?

01:22:48.761 --> 01:22:51.472
I will fucking kill
you right now!

01:22:52.765 --> 01:22:55.727
I strangled him
in the parking lot.

01:22:58.104 --> 01:23:00.690
I took his wallet and his watch.

01:23:01.565 --> 01:23:02.608
The next day

01:23:04.484 --> 01:23:07.070
they concluded
that he'd been the victim

01:23:07.113 --> 01:23:09.240
of a mugging gone wrong.

01:23:09.282 --> 01:23:10.617
Why?

01:23:10.658 --> 01:23:13.244
What did he have on you?

01:23:13.286 --> 01:23:15.496
Why should I
have to tell you that?

01:23:15.537 --> 01:23:17.122
I've already
confessed killing him.

01:23:17.164 --> 01:23:18.875
The motive
is important for the

01:23:18.917 --> 01:23:21.169
completeness of your confession.

01:23:21.211 --> 01:23:23.171
We need it for our records.

01:23:23.212 --> 01:23:24.046
Alright.

01:23:27.884 --> 01:23:31.720
I had sex with Peter

01:23:31.721 --> 01:23:33.722
when he was 10.

01:23:33.765 --> 01:23:35.682
How many boys
did you have sex with?

01:23:50.698 --> 01:23:52.784
My turn

01:23:52.824 --> 01:23:54.077
Be my guest.

01:23:56.203 --> 01:24:00.791
You do realize this is
double jeopardy for me?

01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:03.752
I was tried and completely
exonerated of this crime.

01:24:03.795 --> 01:24:06.713
What crime are you
talking about Jaclyn?

01:24:06.756 --> 01:24:07.590
Okay.

01:24:09.007 --> 01:24:11.386
You already know.

01:24:11.387 --> 01:24:12.887
Let me remind you,

01:24:12.929 --> 01:24:15.597
we don't care
about your rights here.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.685
You're here to pay a
price for what you did.

01:24:18.725 --> 01:24:19.560
Alright?

01:24:20.895 --> 01:24:24.774
And your only chance is
to confess to the crimes.

01:24:25.817 --> 01:24:27.443
Take it or leave it.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.194
Okay.

01:24:30.947 --> 01:24:32.198
What the hell.

01:24:39.872 --> 01:24:42.040
Three years ago I was
contacted by a lottery winner

01:24:42.082 --> 01:24:44.376
to oversee his winnings.

01:24:44.418 --> 01:24:46.128
He had two sons.

01:24:46.171 --> 01:24:50.550
His wife had passed but
no other living relatives.

01:24:50.591 --> 01:24:52.634
After we became friends,

01:24:52.676 --> 01:24:54.261
he asked me
to be in line as a beneficiary

01:24:54.304 --> 01:24:56.597
after his kids.

01:24:56.598 --> 01:24:58.932
He wanted me
to oversee the giving

01:24:58.975 --> 01:25:01.686
of his money
to certain charities,

01:25:01.728 --> 01:25:03.270
if it came to that.

01:25:04.814 --> 01:25:09.402
People should never sign
things they don't read.

01:25:09.444 --> 01:25:11.154
What happened then?

01:25:13.405 --> 01:25:16.242
I had a real estate deal
go bad.

01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:18.036
And I was being sued.

01:25:20.829 --> 01:25:24.417
I lost everything and I
was about to lose my house.

01:25:24.458 --> 01:25:26.668
I had already moved John's
money to the Cayman islands

01:25:26.711 --> 01:25:30.088
in an account he and I
could both sign off on.

01:25:30.131 --> 01:25:31.048
And?

01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:32.132
And what?!

01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:36.887
I've already
been tried for this.

01:25:36.930 --> 01:25:39.390
I told you Jaclyn,
I don't care.

01:25:39.431 --> 01:25:41.809
This is life or death here.

01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:43.894
Ask your friends.

01:25:43.936 --> 01:25:48.065
Harry, Robby, Jeffrey.

01:25:48.066 --> 01:25:48.899
Okay.

01:25:51.485 --> 01:25:52.319
Dammit!

01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:04.541
They had a lake house
in Delaware

01:26:04.582 --> 01:26:07.043
they went to on weekends.

01:26:07.085 --> 01:26:09.127
I showed up one evening.

01:26:15.051 --> 01:26:17.887
At dinner
I poisoned their drinks.

01:26:19.055 --> 01:26:21.850
With what?

01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:23.935
Aconite.

01:26:23.936 --> 01:26:25.562
It's practically untraceable
in an autopsy

01:26:25.603 --> 01:26:29.106
especially if you're
not looking for poison.

01:26:29.148 --> 01:26:30.108
Clever

01:26:31.693 --> 01:26:32.860
After they died
I put their bodies

01:26:32.902 --> 01:26:35.488
in his car and I drove
it to a secluded ridge

01:26:35.529 --> 01:26:37.573
I knew of in New Jersey.

01:26:40.534 --> 01:26:41.743
And then what?

01:26:42.828 --> 01:26:44.956
In the movie
North By Northwest

01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:46.957
they put a drunken Cary Grant

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.376
into the drivers seat of a car

01:26:48.417 --> 01:26:50.920
and headed him toward a cliff.

01:26:50.962 --> 01:26:53.923
So you did the same thing?

01:26:53.965 --> 01:26:55.884
Essentially the same.

01:26:55.925 --> 01:26:57.969
Alcohol and all.

01:26:58.011 --> 01:26:59.387
Except for the car did

01:26:59.429 --> 01:27:01.847
smash into that ditch.

01:27:01.890 --> 01:27:04.809
It looked totally
like an accident.

01:27:06.144 --> 01:27:08.396
Well why were you tried?

01:27:08.438 --> 01:27:10.773
After the car
went into the ditch

01:27:10.814 --> 01:27:12.357
I was left on foot.

01:27:13.318 --> 01:27:14.944
There was a diner
a few miles up the road

01:27:14.985 --> 01:27:16.528
I called a taxi
to meet me there.

01:27:16.570 --> 01:27:20.490
But the cops showed up
before I could get away.

01:27:21.326 --> 01:27:22.702
Took our names.

01:27:22.743 --> 01:27:25.412
Asked us if we
had seen anything.

01:27:25.454 --> 01:27:29.583
Naturally I left without
getting into trouble.

01:27:29.626 --> 01:27:31.878
It was a month later when
the District Attorney

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.172
of New Jersey
called me into question.

01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:39.010
I was tied to the money and seen

01:27:39.051 --> 01:27:40.844
suspiciously near
the scene of the crime

01:27:40.886 --> 01:27:42.721
so I was put on trial.

01:27:46.016 --> 01:27:48.978
There.

01:27:48.979 --> 01:27:50.646
That's everything.

01:27:51.814 --> 01:27:54.025
And I was completely honest.

01:27:57.819 --> 01:28:00.739
Sorry guys,
but I think I got this.

01:28:02.367 --> 01:28:03.868
I think she does.

01:28:04.868 --> 01:28:06.203
Bravo.

01:28:06.246 --> 01:28:08.038
That was great Jaclyn.

01:28:08.081 --> 01:28:10.250
I gotta say,
that's the best confession

01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:11.668
I've ever seen.

01:28:14.002 --> 01:28:16.005
You're free to go sweetie.

01:28:29.601 --> 01:28:39.487
Best of luck to you both.

01:28:39.488 --> 01:28:40.320
You?

01:28:45.201 --> 01:28:46.536
Hello Jaclyn.

01:28:48.246 --> 01:28:50.498
Hey man, back from hell.

01:28:51.666 --> 01:28:53.168
Yeah we brought
a couple of friends

01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:55.461
who are dying to meet you.

01:28:58.256 --> 01:29:00.008
Jaclyn
Stevenson you're under arrest

01:29:00.048 --> 01:29:01.885
for the murder of John
Smith and his two sons.

01:29:01.926 --> 01:29:04.679
Brad and Matthew Smith.

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.306
You can't do this!

01:29:07.724 --> 01:29:09.893
What is this, some sort of joke?

01:29:09.934 --> 01:29:12.020
Your trial was in New
Jersey right Ms. Stevenson?

01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.479
Yes, and I was found innocent.

01:29:14.521 --> 01:29:16.899
But you murdered the
Smith family in Delaware

01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:19.860
as you just confessed
to, just as we suspected.

01:29:19.903 --> 01:29:23.072
Now you get to go to
trial again on our dime.

01:29:23.113 --> 01:29:24.448
Recognize this?

01:29:24.489 --> 01:29:26.909
No doubt you thought it
was empty Ms. Stevenson.

01:29:26.951 --> 01:29:29.037
Aconite leaves traces

01:29:29.078 --> 01:29:29.913
and we got a partial print.

01:29:29.953 --> 01:29:31.246
I was coerced
into a confession.

01:29:31.288 --> 01:29:33.081
These people tricked me!

01:29:33.123 --> 01:29:37.002
Yeah, we do have witnesses
as to what you said.

01:29:38.128 --> 01:29:40.006
Let me introduce myself.

01:29:40.047 --> 01:29:41.757
I'm Charlie Mentz.

01:29:41.798 --> 01:29:45.720
This is a group of very
fine actors that I hired.

01:29:45.761 --> 01:29:48.139
See before you took over
my best friends money,

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:49.932
he had already given me plenty.

01:29:49.974 --> 01:29:52.644
I couldn't accept the fact that
you were declared innocent.

01:29:52.685 --> 01:29:54.938
So I decided to launch
my own investigation.

01:29:54.979 --> 01:29:58.066
Arrest this man for
kidnapping and assault!

01:29:58.106 --> 01:29:59.317
Got any proof?

01:30:00.902 --> 01:30:03.154
You just came
to a confession party.

01:30:03.195 --> 01:30:04.697
Isn't that right Jaclyn?

01:30:04.738 --> 01:30:06.073
That's right.

01:30:06.114 --> 01:30:07.699
The footage clearly shows
your car

01:30:07.742 --> 01:30:10.161
pulling in the complex.

01:30:10.203 --> 01:30:11.663
We got you baby.

01:30:13.288 --> 01:30:15.707
Unfortunately, you seem
to have parked in a

01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:17.292
blind spot for the cameras.

01:30:17.335 --> 01:30:20.046
Making it impossible to
see who exited the car.

01:30:20.087 --> 01:30:22.506
You really need
to get that fixed aye?

01:30:22.548 --> 01:30:24.384
You son of a bitch!

01:30:24.425 --> 01:30:25.260
I am.

01:30:26.135 --> 01:30:29.055
And I say you did die tonight.

01:30:29.096 --> 01:30:31.181
Delaware has the death penalty.

01:30:34.018 --> 01:30:36.270
Time has run out Jaclyn.

01:30:36.311 --> 01:30:38.105
Congratulations.

01:30:38.146 --> 01:30:39.815
You really got me.

01:30:41.609 --> 01:30:43.152
Now go fuck yourselves!

01:30:44.737 --> 01:30:45.989
Jaclyn the language on you.

01:30:46.029 --> 01:30:47.364
Yeah.

01:30:54.162 --> 01:30:55.289
Freaking did it!

01:30:58.208 --> 01:30:59.001
We did it!

01:30:59.042 --> 01:31:00.210
Yeah!

01:31:00.252 --> 01:31:01.045
Yeah!

01:31:01.087 --> 01:31:05.091
Fuck yeah!

01:31:05.092 --> 01:31:06.009
High five.

01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:07.217
Look at this, hey!

01:31:09.970 --> 01:31:11.597
Bring it in sweetheart.

01:31:11.639 --> 01:31:13.600
Come on, come on, come on.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.100
Come on bring it over.

01:31:15.143 --> 01:31:17.020
Come on, come on bring it in.

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:19.021
Come on, let's celebrate.

01:31:19.063 --> 01:31:21.231
Please, let me just say.

01:31:21.274 --> 01:31:24.235
Guys from the bottom
of my heart,

01:31:24.277 --> 01:31:25.944
I love every one of ya.

01:31:25.987 --> 01:31:27.404
Alright?

01:31:27.447 --> 01:31:28.198
Let's do it.

01:31:28.238 --> 01:31:29.156
Come on, come on let's do it.

01:31:29.198 --> 01:31:30.199
Let's celebrate!

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.119
Come on!

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.581
Bada bing bada boom.
