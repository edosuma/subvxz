12:39.092 --> 12:39.966
Wow.

12:40.093 --> 12:40.967
- No, it's true.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.552
It seems that single life
has just kind of

12:42.678 --> 12:44.638
kicked the sweet little
Miss Cardigan right out of you.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.639
What?
No, no, I like it.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.640
This whole Urban Outfitters,

12:46.766 --> 12:48.308
Edie Sedgwick thing works,
you know?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.352
It's kind of, like,
it's edgy, but it's distinctive.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.353
- That's great.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.771
That's exactly what
I was going for.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.980
- You look good, Sara.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.315
- Thanks, Sam.
- Really.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.358
Good for you.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.151
- Thank you.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.195
- Okay, all right, where was I?

13:00.321 --> 13:01.196
- Big.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.197
- Oh, right, okay.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.116
So, I'm out with this girl,

13:04.242 --> 13:06.243
and this big, big guy,
he comes over to us.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.328
- Who was it?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.788
- Nicki.

13:09.914 --> 13:10.789
Nicki?

13:10.915 --> 13:11.790
- Wow.

13:11.916 --> 13:12.791
- No, Nicole.

13:12.917 --> 13:13.834
Okay, whatever.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.337
So he comes over there
and he says,

13:17.463 --> 13:20.882
"You boys nowadays
are all the same."

13:21.008 --> 13:23.093
"Excuse me?"

13:23.219 --> 13:24.261
He said,

13:24.387 --> 13:26.638
"All you smoothie type fellows
go around thinking you are

13:26.764 --> 13:29.349
the Lord's own gift
to the female species."

13:29.475 --> 13:31.434
- Was he black?

13:31.561 --> 13:33.895
- Yeah, actually.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.647
- Mm, racist, that's racist.

13:35.773 --> 13:36.815
- What?
That's how he talked.

13:36.941 --> 13:37.899
- Finish your story.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.609
- But you want to know
how to really be great,

13:39.735 --> 13:43.613
how a great lover
really pleases a lady?

13:43.739 --> 13:45.949
Now, most of these fellas
haven't got the first damn clue.

13:46.075 --> 13:46.950
Not really.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.202
You know, a lot of them
don't even care,

13:49.328 --> 13:50.412
to tell you the truth.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.830
Now, that's your first type,

13:51.956 --> 13:54.082
right, your Joe Six-Pack cracker
type fella.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.459
Yeah, and he's like
your basic pig, right?

13:56.586 --> 13:58.879
The type that rolls on,
has at her,

13:59.005 --> 14:00.797
and the minute he's done, right,

14:00.923 --> 14:03.216
he rolls off again
and then commences to snoring.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.427
But you see,
these fellas are just animals.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.970
They're not even in the same
type of game

14:07.096 --> 14:08.388
that we're talking about here.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.723
No, what we're talking
about here

14:09.849 --> 14:11.683
is your basic secondary
type of fella,

14:11.809 --> 14:14.227
the fella that thinks
he's a great lover,

14:14.353 --> 14:16.479
your sensitive
male smoothie type.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.149
Now, what they're into
is a woman's pleasure.

14:19.275 --> 14:23.069
And giving the woman pleasure,
that's this type's whole trip.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.572
And I'm guessing from looking
at you over here right now

14:25.698 --> 14:27.866
that you've been up against
a smoothie a time or two,

14:27.992 --> 14:29.451
who runs down
to Barnes and Noble's

14:29.577 --> 14:32.829
for all the latest female
sexuality-type books,

14:32.955 --> 14:34.164
huh, right?

14:34.290 --> 14:37.125
With the pheromone aftershave
and holding and touching,

14:37.251 --> 14:40.712
and you know, about the earlobe
and the back side of the knee

14:40.838 --> 14:42.130
and, and all that,

14:42.256 --> 14:45.091
with the strawberry oil
and the hand massages.

14:45.218 --> 14:49.429
But, but, will he let
the little lady replicate?

14:49.555 --> 14:50.472
Hmm?

14:50.598 --> 14:53.099
Will he allow her to give him
so much as a backrub?

14:53.226 --> 14:54.601
No, sir, he will not,

14:54.727 --> 14:57.646
Because this type's whole trip
is that he's got to be the one

14:57.772 --> 14:58.688
giving the pleasure here.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.065
Thank you very much, ma'am.

15:00.191 --> 15:04.110
And this, this is what gives me
contempt for these guys

15:04.237 --> 15:06.947
that go around thinking that
they're the Lord's own gift

15:07.073 --> 15:08.573
to the female species.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.784
And watching them in bed
is like watching

15:10.910 --> 15:12.327
when the mechanics
in the white suits

15:12.453 --> 15:13.662
workin' on a Porsche.

15:13.788 --> 15:16.539
They're all swelled up
on their own expertise.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.251
They think they're
a great lover.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.795
They think they're being
generous in bed.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.755
What they don't understand

15:23.881 --> 15:26.049
is that their type
is an even worse drag

15:26.175 --> 15:27.300
for the lady with any sense

15:27.426 --> 15:29.219
than the on-and-off pig
ever was,

15:29.345 --> 15:34.641
because how'd you like to just
lay there and be worked on, huh,

15:34.767 --> 15:35.934
like a Porsche?

15:36.060 --> 15:38.353
You see, that's where
your smoothie types

15:38.479 --> 15:39.980
always lose the game.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.233
They want to be the only
great lover in bed.

15:43.359 --> 15:47.487
Now, you want my opinion, huh?

15:47.613 --> 15:52.117
You want know how
to be really great, hmm?

15:52.243 --> 15:57.289
There's only one in a thousand
fellas that's figured it out.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.416
The secret is, you've got to-

15:59.542 --> 16:01.668
- I disagree.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.669
- What?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.629
- I disagree that's it's
impossible to determine

16:04.755 --> 16:07.507
what it is they really want.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.467
- I don't think I said
"impossible."

16:10.136 --> 16:13.847
- Though I do agree that
in today's postfeminist era

16:13.973 --> 16:15.307
it's unprecedentedly difficult

16:15.433 --> 16:17.809
and takes some serious deductive
firepower and imagination.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.978
- I mean, if it was
literally impossible,

16:20.104 --> 16:21.688
then where would we be
as a species?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.524
- And I do agree that you can't
necessarily go

16:24.650 --> 16:26.234
just by what they say they want.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.485
- 'Cause they're only saying it

16:27.611 --> 16:29.195
'cause they think
they're supposed to.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.363
The media perpetuates it.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.532
- My position is that actually
most of the time

16:32.658 --> 16:34.784
you can figure out
what they want,

16:34.910 --> 16:36.578
I mean, logically deduce it,

16:36.704 --> 16:38.747
if you're willing to make
the effort to understand them

16:38.873 --> 16:41.958
and to understand the impossible
situation they're in.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.378
- Schizophrenic media discourse,

16:45.504 --> 16:49.466

for example, Cosmo.

On one hand, get liberated.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.345
On the other hand,

with that mess

16:56.015 --> 16:58.767

in today's media culture?

16:58.893 --> 17:03.271

is to understand her,

17:03.397 --> 17:06.733
understand the paradox.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.277
Damned either way.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.578
Yeah, I love to watch them move,

17:18.704 --> 17:25.210
and I love how different
they all are.

17:25.336 --> 17:29.589
I love to hear them giggle,

17:29.715 --> 17:31.591
you know, the different
little sounds.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.801
Yeah.

17:32.927 --> 17:37.263
I love how you can
never understand them

17:37.390 --> 17:40.642
and the way that you just can't
keep them from shopping,

17:40.768 --> 17:41.768

17:56.367 --> 17:58.910

be a fascinating example

to the documenter

rather than the documented.

In all the sciences

20:33.399 --> 20:34.774
And what I do is,

20:34.900 --> 20:38.236
I go back there, and I talk
to this one and that one,

20:38.362 --> 20:40.947

21:50.643 --> 21:53.853
holding them with the good arm
going, "It's okay.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.021
"Hey, it's okay.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.522
"Don't cry.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.442
"Don't be sad.

21:59.568 --> 22:05.740
"Trusting you has made me
feel so very, very special.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.033
"And now with your help,

22:07.159 --> 22:12.038
I can go out there and not
be ashamed of this arm."

22:12.164 --> 22:13.164
And so on.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.958
Oh, more pussy
than a toilet seat, man.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.418
I shit you not.

22:17.544 --> 22:18.961
Go 'head and ask Jackpot
and Kenny Kirk.

22:19.088 --> 22:19.962
They'll tell you.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.298
Kenny Kirk's the one
that named it the Asset.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.508
Go ahead and ask him.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.010
More pussy than a toilet seat.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.179
- No, I know.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.180
I know.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.724
Hey, hang on a second.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.393
Hey, no, I know.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.020
You think I don't know
that I can be moody sometimes?

22:36.146 --> 22:37.855
Think I don't-

22:37.981 --> 22:41.651
No, and I know that I can be
withdrawn at other times,

22:41.777 --> 22:44.237
and that I can be hard
to be in this with, okay?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.197
But I just-

22:46.323 --> 22:47.949
No, I'm not saying
that this is reassuring.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.035
What I'm saying is that
I'm trying to get you to see

22:51.161 --> 22:55.123
that sometimes things
ebb and flow, okay?

22:55.249 --> 22:56.332
And that's-

22:56.458 --> 23:00.002
and sometimes people are more
into it than other times,

23:00.129 --> 23:02.964
and that's just how it is.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.967
But you, you can't stand that.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.552
I feel like-

23:07.678 --> 23:10.805
I feel like no ebb's allowed.

23:10.931 --> 23:16.102
And that breaks my heart.

23:16.228 --> 23:21.107
That just breaks my heart.

23:21.233 --> 23:26.112
Maybe if I cared about you
a little less,

23:26.238 --> 23:29.615
maybe if I loved you
a little less

23:29.742 --> 23:31.159
then I could take it.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.827
But I-

23:32.953 --> 23:36.122
What?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.582
Yeah, that's what the bags
are for.

23:37.708 --> 23:38.583
I'm leaving.

23:38.709 --> 23:39.584
No!

23:39.710 --> 23:42.754
Well, I don't think that you
understand.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.630
Wait, hey, listen.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.591
Just try to listen for one sec.

23:46.717 --> 23:49.677
Try to absorb what I'm gonna
say to you, okay?

23:49.803 --> 23:52.638
My leaving is not a confirmation
of your fears.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.223
It isn't.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.767
It is because of them.

23:55.893 --> 23:57.643
And I know that you're totally
hating me for this,

23:57.770 --> 24:00.104
and I have spent a lot of time
getting ready to the place

24:00.230 --> 24:02.190
where I can face you
totally hating me for this.

24:02.316 --> 24:07.153
And if you could see
the look on your face-

24:07.279 --> 24:08.696
I can.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.782
I can see it right now.

24:10.908 --> 24:13.159
That look on your face,

24:13.285 --> 24:14.702
if anybody could see it,

24:14.828 --> 24:19.791
they'd understand
why I'm leaving.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.959
[door creaks]

24:22.085 --> 24:28.007
- [laughs]

24:28.133 --> 24:30.343
- Because this isn't exactly
easy for me, either.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.552
Okay?

24:31.678 --> 24:34.055
Leaving you like this,

24:34.181 --> 24:38.559
seeing your face,

24:38.685 --> 24:42.438
like this is my last
mental picture of you...

24:46.443 --> 24:49.111
Can you see that I might be
pretty torn up about it too?

24:49.238 --> 24:52.031
Yeah.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.659
Can you?

24:54.785 --> 24:56.285
- And...

24:56.411 --> 25:01.874
oh, I love it when they
bat their eyes or pout,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.211
you know, when they give you
that little look.

25:05.337 --> 25:09.382
[chuckles softly]

25:09.508 --> 25:12.885
The way they look in heels,

25:13.011 --> 25:16.848
those teeny red bumps
that people get

25:16.974 --> 25:18.558
when they're shaving
their legs-

25:18.684 --> 25:21.310
that women get
when they're shaving their legs.

25:25.107 --> 25:25.982
- I'm sorry.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.567
I was asking if you were using
this chair.

25:27.693 --> 25:28.568
- No.
Go ahead.

25:28.694 --> 25:29.610
- Thanks so much.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.237
- So...
- Right.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.572
I meet her at the airport.

25:32.698 --> 25:33.573
Right, well wait.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.866
Let me go back for a second.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.784
So I'm last off again, as usual,

25:36.910 --> 25:38.744
and all that business
like that there.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.081
- Yes, just wait and relax
in your seat, be the last off.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.126
Why everybody right away
all the time has got to stand up

25:45.252 --> 25:47.253
as soon as it comes to a stop
and cram into the aisles

25:47.379 --> 25:48.421
so you just stand there-

25:48.547 --> 25:49.881
- Wait. Just wait.
Just wait.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.257
So finally, coming out
into baggage

25:51.383 --> 25:53.092
and the whole transportation
shit show there-

25:53.218 --> 25:54.302
- Yeah, still always depressing

25:54.428 --> 25:55.928
to come out in baggage
on these cold calls

25:56.054 --> 25:58.180
and see everybody getting met
with the squeals and the hugs

25:58.307 --> 26:00.474
and the limo guys with the names
on the cardboard-

26:00.601 --> 26:01.517
- Just stop.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.603
Shut it for one fucking second,
will you, please?

26:03.729 --> 26:09.025
Because, it's mostly emptied out
by the time I get out there.

26:11.570 --> 26:15.114
Except for over by-

26:15.240 --> 26:16.324
there's this one girl left.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.909
She's peering through
the glass doors

26:18.035 --> 26:20.036
down the Jetway thing.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.997
Our eyes meet and all
that business like that there.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.667
And what-she-she up
and goes down on her knees.

26:26.793 --> 26:27.668
She drops,

26:27.794 --> 26:29.295
crying, slapping the carpet,

26:29.421 --> 26:32.381
bent over so you can, you know,
just about see her tits,

26:32.507 --> 26:34.508
totally hysterical,

26:34.635 --> 26:37.720
with the waterworks and all
that business like that there.

26:37.846 --> 26:38.971
- Another cheery welcome

26:39.097 --> 26:41.682
to Dayton for your fucking
cold calls.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.435
"Hey, we'd like to welcome
you to Dayton."

26:44.561 --> 26:45.436
- No!

26:45.562 --> 26:47.438
It's a story, a story.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.650
It turns out when I, you know,
go over to say, "Are you okay?

26:50.776 --> 26:51.817
Is anything the matter?"

26:51.944 --> 26:53.277
And like that.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.404
And get a better shot of,
I got to tell you,

26:55.530 --> 26:57.281
some pretty fuckin'
incredible tits.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.324
Wait.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.493
She's all down and bent over.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.996
She says,
"I'm in love with this guy."

27:04.122 --> 27:05.998
And he said that he was
in love with her too,

27:06.124 --> 27:07.833
except he was already engaged
from priorly.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.002
So already there's all this
back and forth

27:10.128 --> 27:12.129
and storm and drag.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.006
And I'm lending the ear to her,
you know.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.216
- Right, right

27:15.342 --> 27:20.012
- And she says, but finally,
the guy gets off the fence.

27:20.138 --> 27:24.517
And he says he's gonna surrender
to his love

27:24.643 --> 27:26.018
for this girl here
with the tits

27:26.144 --> 27:27.019
and that he's gonna go back

27:27.145 --> 27:28.396
and tell this other girl
in Tulsa,

27:28.522 --> 27:30.356
where he's from,
break it off,

27:30.482 --> 27:34.276
and commit to this
hysterical girl with the tits,

27:34.403 --> 27:36.404
who feels like finally,
for chrissakes,

27:36.530 --> 27:37.863
after all
the one-track shitheels

27:37.990 --> 27:39.073
she'd got
the runaround from,

27:39.199 --> 27:41.575
finally here at last she's met
a guy she can trust

27:41.702 --> 27:44.245
and love and merge souls with

27:44.371 --> 27:48.040
and the whole sort of violins,
hearts, flowers-

27:48.166 --> 27:49.458
- And blah, blah, blah.

27:49.584 --> 27:50.459
- And blah.

27:50.585 --> 27:53.879
So, off the guy goes
flying back to Tulsa.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.965
Then he puts his hand
over his heart

27:56.091 --> 27:57.550
and swears he's
coming back to her,

27:57.676 --> 28:00.052
and he'll be on that plane there
with the flight number and time.

28:00.178 --> 28:04.932
And she swears she'll be there
with the tits, to meet him.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.350
- Yeah.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.145
We can't see that one coming.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.938
- And she says how
he even called her.

28:11.064 --> 28:11.939
It rings.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.441
It's this guy.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.944
There's all this static and hiss
on the phone.

28:17.070 --> 28:20.406
He says he's calling her
from the sky,

28:20.532 --> 28:23.242
is how romantically he puts it.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.786
Calling her in flight on one
of the little phone thing there.

28:25.912 --> 28:26.871
- Hey, you know what?

28:26.997 --> 28:28.873
The markup on those things
goes six bucks a minute.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.332
It's a racket.
- That's not the point.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.542
Do you want to hear this or not?

28:31.668 --> 28:33.419
That's not the point.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.213
This girl says how
she gets there early

28:36.339 --> 28:37.256
in the baggage area

28:37.382 --> 28:38.924
and already with some
of the waterworks

28:39.051 --> 28:40.634
from love and violins.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.094
And it gets in finally,
the flight.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.804
And they-we-

28:43.930 --> 28:46.474
all in the big
rush out the Jetway thing.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.392
He's not in the first wave out.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.607
He's not in the second wave out,
how they come out.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.108
- Jesus, I ought to-

28:56.234 --> 28:58.778
the amount of fucking time
I spend in baggage.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.113
- And says like a pathetic,
a total fool,

29:01.239 --> 29:04.450
her faith never faltering,

29:04.576 --> 29:06.452
she just kept peering

29:06.578 --> 29:08.662
during all the hugging
and everybody meeting

29:08.789 --> 29:11.582
and every time
expecting this guy.

29:11.708 --> 29:12.583
Waiting.

29:12.709 --> 29:16.295
- Poor little muttski.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.339
- But then at the end there,
I come off.

29:18.465 --> 29:24.136
Last off, as usual.

29:24.262 --> 29:27.681
- That bastard even must have
faked the phone call.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.809
The static,
if you run your Remington,

29:29.935 --> 29:31.310
it'll make static.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.771
- And I am telling you,

29:33.897 --> 29:37.817
you have never seen anybody
so the word "heartbroken."

29:37.943 --> 29:39.360
You think it's just words,
blah, blah.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.986
But then you see this girl
with this hand

29:41.113 --> 29:43.447
knocking herself in the head
for being such a fool,

29:43.573 --> 29:45.199
crying so hard
she can't mostly breathe

29:45.325 --> 29:47.159
and all that business like that.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.329
And how men are shits,
and don't even trust 'em.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.289
- Men are mostly shits.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.290
It's true.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.583
- It's true.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.627
Most guys are shit.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.255
My heart...

30:03.552 --> 30:06.095
My heart's going out
to this poor girl.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.307
- Heh, heh.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.188
- "Heh, heh"?

30:16.314 --> 30:18.274
- [laughs]

30:26.032 --> 30:27.867
- You got to ask?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.285
- You shitheel.

30:29.411 --> 30:30.494
- What?

30:30.620 --> 30:31.787
What am I gonna do?
- You bastard.

30:31.913 --> 30:32.788
- You know.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.374
- You shitheel.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.091
click!

30:46.136 --> 30:49.555
- Hence, the timeless importance
of passion.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.266
- Women want to be both
irresponsible and passionate.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.350
- No.

30:53.476 --> 30:55.060
What they want is to experience
a passion

30:55.187 --> 30:57.646
that is so powerful
and irresistible

30:57.772 --> 31:00.065
that it obliterates any guilt
or tension that they may have

31:00.192 --> 31:02.109
about betraying their
perceived responsibilities.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.194
- And deep down,

31:03.320 --> 31:04.612
they all want
to be irresponsible.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.280
- Deep down, they want a man

31:06.406 --> 31:09.116
who's gonna be so passionate and
powerful

31:09.242 --> 31:11.285
that they have no choice.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.704
This thing is bigger
than both of them.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.539
- [over recording]
You shitheel!

31:15.707 --> 31:18.542
- [chuckles]

31:18.668 --> 31:20.961
[nervous sigh]

31:21.087 --> 31:22.296
The hell with it, right?

31:22.422 --> 31:26.717
For science, right?

31:26.843 --> 31:28.928
I'm sorry, that is what this is,
right, science?

31:29.054 --> 31:30.429
It'll be used for-

31:30.555 --> 31:32.431
oh, never mind, never mind.

31:32.557 --> 31:33.557
You know what you're doing.

31:33.683 --> 31:34.642
[chuckles nervously]

31:34.768 --> 31:36.435
[knocking at door]

31:47.614 --> 31:50.616
- Hey.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.763
You cut your hair.

32:15.558 --> 32:18.644
It looks good.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.771
- Sweetie, we need to talk.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.982
We've needed to for a while.

32:23.108 --> 32:23.983
I have.

32:24.109 --> 32:27.111
I mean, I feel like-

32:33.326 --> 32:34.827
Can you sit?

32:34.953 --> 32:42.334
Sweetie, my relationship record
indicates a guy who's bad news.

32:42.460 --> 32:47.631
You see, I have a history,
a pattern, so to speak

32:47.757 --> 32:49.883
of coming on very fast and hard

32:50.010 --> 32:52.678
in the beginning
of a relationship,

32:52.804 --> 32:56.015
of saying "I love you"
very early on.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.933
It's not as if how many of them
I've said it to

32:58.059 --> 33:00.436
is not an understandable
question or concern,

33:00.562 --> 33:02.730
but if it's all right,
it's just-

33:02.856 --> 33:04.148
[sighs]

33:04.274 --> 33:06.066
it's just not what I'm trying
to talk to you about.

33:06.192 --> 33:09.320
So I want to hold off on things
like names or numbers

33:09.446 --> 33:10.696
and just try to be honest
with you

33:10.822 --> 33:13.324
about what my concerns are,

33:13.450 --> 33:15.200
'cause I care about you
a great deal.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.368
I'm not explaining this well.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.536
I'm not getting through.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.121
I'm really starting
to freak out.

33:19.247 --> 33:22.041
And I know it's insecure,

33:22.167 --> 33:24.209
but it's very important to me

33:24.336 --> 33:25.794
that you believe
that I have meant it

33:25.920 --> 33:28.380
absolutely every time I told you
that I loved you,

33:28.506 --> 33:29.631
every time.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.175
And I know I should've told you

33:31.301 --> 33:33.344
some of all this
about me sooner,

33:33.470 --> 33:35.054
before you moved
all the way out here,

33:35.180 --> 33:38.640
which, believe me, meant so-

33:38.767 --> 33:40.934
it made me feel
you really cared about this,

33:41.061 --> 33:42.519
especially because your moving
out here

33:42.645 --> 33:43.937
was something I lobbied
so hard for.

33:44.064 --> 33:44.938
School,

33:45.065 --> 33:46.857
your apartment,

33:46.983 --> 33:48.609
having to get rid of your cat,

33:48.735 --> 33:49.610
Stitches,

33:49.736 --> 33:50.652
Snookers,

33:50.779 --> 33:52.071
Mr. Fluffy.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.155
And I know-I know a better guy

33:53.281 --> 33:54.573
probably would've
told you about this

33:54.699 --> 33:55.783
before we even slept together.

33:55.909 --> 33:58.911
And despite how
incredibly magical

33:59.037 --> 34:01.205
and ecstatic
and right it was-

34:01.331 --> 34:02.748
[frustrated groan]

34:02.874 --> 34:06.043
Can you imagine what it takes
to tell you this,

34:06.169 --> 34:07.669
that I'm terrified,

34:07.796 --> 34:10.505
that it's even possible
that the pattern of sending out

34:10.632 --> 34:11.757
mixed signals and pulling away

34:11.882 --> 34:13.759
is just another way
of pulling away?

34:13.885 --> 34:15.761
Maybe deep down,
I'm such a coward

34:15.887 --> 34:17.929
that I can't pull away myself,

34:18.056 --> 34:20.724
so I somehow force you
into doing it.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.226
Those are valid,

34:22.726 --> 34:24.770
totally understandable
questions, sweetie.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.522
There's just one more thing
I feel like

34:26.648 --> 34:28.524
I have to tell you about first,
though.

34:28.650 --> 34:32.360
God, I am terrified to tell you,
but I'm gonna tell you.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.737
Can you do me a favor
and sort of brace yourself

34:34.864 --> 34:35.864
and promise not to react

34:35.989 --> 34:37.324
for a few seconds
after I tell you?

34:37.449 --> 34:38.659
Can you promise?

34:38.784 --> 34:40.119
Can you promise?

34:40.245 --> 34:41.328
Can you promise?

34:41.454 --> 34:44.456
Can you promise?

34:50.547 --> 34:55.634
- Maybe we should talk later.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.595
I've got a rehearsal
for this thing,

34:58.721 --> 35:02.933
and think I have a break
for a couple hours

35:03.059 --> 35:06.145
if you wanted to-

35:06.271 --> 35:07.146
you know what?

35:07.272 --> 35:10.607
I'll call you.

35:10.733 --> 35:14.987
I'm here if you need me.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.364
Okay?

35:19.617 --> 35:23.745
- Why?

35:23.872 --> 35:26.498
Why did you do it?

35:26.624 --> 35:30.294
How could you do it?

35:30.420 --> 35:35.174
That's all I ever get,
is this face,

35:35.300 --> 35:37.050
this remorseful face of yours.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.510
You had the same face
when you left.

35:38.636 --> 35:42.598
You just stood there
with this look.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.310
[sighs]

35:46.436 --> 35:48.020
What?

35:48.146 --> 35:53.859
You fucking coward.

35:53.985 --> 35:58.489
You are all cowards.

35:58.615 --> 36:01.366
You say you were unfaithful.

36:01.493 --> 36:05.078
You say you're sorry.

36:05.205 --> 36:08.415
You say you can't imagine
how much it must hurt.

36:08.541 --> 36:09.416
- And I can't.

36:09.542 --> 36:14.046
- Try.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.506
Try.

36:17.383 --> 36:20.052
- Well, call him and see
if he'll, you know,

36:20.178 --> 36:21.094
set up something.

36:21.221 --> 36:25.766
But it needs to be soon,
I would think, right?

36:25.892 --> 36:28.685
Yeah.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.062
Okay.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.190
Bye.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.694
- Professor?

36:37.820 --> 36:39.029
- Oh, Sara.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.405
- Hi.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.865
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

36:41.991 --> 36:42.866
- No, no, no.

36:42.992 --> 36:43.909
Please, come in.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.869
Just grab the door.

36:45.995 --> 36:48.997
[door creaks]

36:53.086 --> 36:53.961
- This okay?

36:54.087 --> 36:55.045
- Yeah.
How are you?

36:55.171 --> 36:56.838
- Fine, thanks.
- I was just-that was my wife.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.883
She's-her mother's kind of
going through a little-

37:00.009 --> 37:01.635
anyway,
it's kind of hard on her.

37:01.761 --> 37:05.639
- That's-gosh, I'm so sorry.

37:05.765 --> 37:06.640
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

37:06.766 --> 37:07.849
I don't mean to make
a big deal-

37:07.976 --> 37:08.892
No, no, it's okay.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.228
I mean, it's gonna be fine.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.273
No, my wife,
she's an extraordinary woman.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.274
Yeah.

37:15.400 --> 37:19.403
She's-I've been married
for 21 years,

37:19.529 --> 37:23.615
and my wife
is just so beautiful,

37:23.741 --> 37:25.325
just a beautiful woman.

37:25.451 --> 37:26.785
- How'd you meet her?

37:26.911 --> 37:27.786
- That's funny.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.705
I was just thinking about that,
the day I met her.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.708
Yeah, I was thinking
about this moment,

37:32.834 --> 37:35.836
and, it was such
a long time ago,

37:35.962 --> 37:37.588
you know,
and I was so young.

37:37.714 --> 37:39.047
And I was thinking-

37:39.173 --> 37:41.508
and this was a big reason
for marrying her-

37:41.634 --> 37:44.344
thinking that I was likely
not gonna do better than this,

37:44.470 --> 37:45.971
you know, because of the way
she looked.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.307
I mean she was so beautiful,
that just-

37:48.433 --> 37:50.517
even after she had a kid,
by the way.

37:50.643 --> 37:52.352
So and I thought,

37:52.478 --> 37:53.604
"God, you know,"-

37:53.730 --> 37:55.897
'cause I had always had
this major dread when I was,

37:56.024 --> 37:58.692
you know, before I got married
that, you know,

37:58.818 --> 38:00.319
that I'd marry some
amazing woman,

38:00.445 --> 38:01.695
beautiful woman
and everything,

38:01.821 --> 38:04.573
and then she'd change, you know,
that she would get pregnant.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.284
And then it would
change her and, you know-

38:07.410 --> 38:08.535
And I'd have to convince myself,

38:08.661 --> 38:10.120
"No, no, this is who
you signed up with.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.414
"This is who you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.167
"This is who you're
gonna be with

38:15.293 --> 38:17.586
for the whole
rest of your life."

38:17.712 --> 38:23.050
God, this just sounds terrible,

38:23.176 --> 38:24.051
so shallow.

38:24.177 --> 38:26.011
Doesn't it?

38:26.137 --> 38:28.597
But I looked at her,
and she was beautiful,

38:28.723 --> 38:29.890
and she was a mother.

38:30.016 --> 38:34.144
And, you know,
I remember thinking,

38:34.270 --> 38:38.607
"This is amazing,
because it's like she's already,

38:38.733 --> 38:43.028
you know, pretested."

38:43.154 --> 38:44.029
Yeah, pretested.

38:44.155 --> 38:47.991
And, I thought-
I actually thought about that.

38:48.117 --> 38:48.992
I thought that.

38:49.118 --> 38:52.537
And I-

38:52.664 --> 38:54.081
Is it shallow?

38:54.207 --> 38:55.666
Does it sound shallow?

38:57.251 --> 39:00.545
Or do you think the truth
behind this kind of thing

39:00.672 --> 39:03.215
will always sound shallow,

39:03.341 --> 39:08.011
you know,
everybody's real reasons?

39:11.516 --> 39:14.559
- Crab cake?

39:14.686 --> 39:16.269
Hey, Miss Quinn.

39:16.396 --> 39:18.271
I stopped by your office hours
earlier this week.

39:18.398 --> 39:22.109
You must've been-

39:22.235 --> 39:27.406
but I'd love to know what you
thought of my paper.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.408
- All right, listen,
that's just ridiculous.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.450
- Well, I'm sorry, Harry,

39:30.576 --> 39:32.160
but that is my opinion
you're stepping on.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.995
- Well, the holidays are
a chance to have fun.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.580
You know, this whole moral
oppression thing

39:35.707 --> 39:36.581
is fuckin' lame.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.250
- Harry.
- What?

39:38.376 --> 39:39.251
I don't need to be guilted

39:39.377 --> 39:40.919
into analyzing
my whole year's actions.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.087
- Wow.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.839
- You know, I'll change
when I want to change.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.507
It doesn't have to be
in December, you know?

39:45.633 --> 39:46.591
It just feels forced.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.593
- Okay, and you got all this
from a kid's show?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.137
- But it's television,
for God's sake.

39:50.263 --> 39:51.221
You know?

39:51.347 --> 39:54.641
I want to watch people revel
and be merry, you know?

39:54.767 --> 39:56.935
I want to watch
pretty things and, like,

39:57.061 --> 39:58.937
funny things
and, like, singy things.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.063
- Oh.

40:00.189 --> 40:01.064
- Singy things?

40:01.190 --> 40:03.775
No, hey, I want to learn
how to revel.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.277
Please, sign me up.
Which hall?

40:05.403 --> 40:06.778
Where're we-
where're we doing that?

40:06.904 --> 40:08.822
- What's the argument?
- It's nothing.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.073
- No, it's not nothing.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.616
- No, I'm probably just tired.

40:11.743 --> 40:12.659
- Tired or depressed.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.244
- I'm not depressed.
I'm not depressed.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.245
Not clinically.

40:15.371 --> 40:16.288
- Are you okay?

40:16.414 --> 40:17.456
- I'm fine.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.791
It's just, the holidays
are always weird for me.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.835
- Well, the holidays
in general, or-

40:21.961 --> 40:23.879
- Okay, you know, is it weird
to get so depressed

40:24.005 --> 40:25.630
watching a children's
Christmas special-

40:25.757 --> 40:27.466
Oh, wait, I shouldn't say that.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.800
I mean, that's not a good word.

40:28.926 --> 40:31.344
It's not just "sadness,"

40:31.471 --> 40:35.640
the way one feels sad
at a film or a funeral.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.560
It's more of
a plummeting quality.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.771
Or the way, you know,

40:40.897 --> 40:46.985
the way that light gets
in winter just before dusk,

40:47.111 --> 40:53.325
or the way she is with me.

40:53.451 --> 40:57.412
All right, at the height
of lovemaking,

40:57.538 --> 41:01.416
you know, the very height,
when she's starting to climax,

41:01.542 --> 41:04.377
and she's really responding
to you now,

41:04.504 --> 41:06.588
you know, her eyes widening
in that way

41:06.714 --> 41:10.008
that's both, you know,
surprise and recognition,

41:10.134 --> 41:12.636
which not a woman alive
could fake or feign

41:12.762 --> 41:15.931
if you really look intently
at her, really see her.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.557
And I don't know,

41:17.683 --> 41:26.107
this moment has
this piercing sadness to it,

41:26.234 --> 41:30.445
of the loss of her in her eyes.

41:30.571 --> 41:35.450
And as her eyes, you know,
widen to their widest point

41:35.576 --> 41:42.207
and as she begins to climax
and arch her back, they close.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.708
You know, shut, the eyes do.

41:43.835 --> 41:49.464
And I can tell that she's closed
her eyes to shut me out.

41:49.590 --> 41:53.051
You know,
I become like an intruder.

41:53.177 --> 41:56.513
And behind those closed lids,
you know,

41:56.639 --> 41:58.431
her eyes are now
rolled all the way around

41:58.558 --> 42:01.017
and staring intently inward
into some void

42:01.143 --> 42:05.480
where I, who sent them,
can't follow.

42:05.606 --> 42:11.903
- It's the ones that act
all understanding,

42:12.029 --> 42:12.988
like they don't care,

42:13.114 --> 42:14.739
and it's okay,
and they understand,

42:14.866 --> 42:18.243
and it doesn't matter,
that embarrass me the most,

42:18.369 --> 42:20.120
because it is so fucking weird
to yell,

42:20.246 --> 42:22.080
"Victory for the forces
of democratic freedom,"

42:22.206 --> 42:23.123
when you're shooting off

42:23.249 --> 42:26.293
that I can tell
they're totally freaked out

42:26.419 --> 42:29.045
and just condescending
down to me

42:29.171 --> 42:31.006
and pretending they understand.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.048
And it's those-

42:32.174 --> 42:33.508
those are the ones
where actually-

42:33.634 --> 42:36.761
I actually end up
almost getting pissed off

42:36.888 --> 42:39.222
and don't even feel embarrassed
not calling them

42:39.348 --> 42:42.267
or totally avoiding them...

42:46.939 --> 42:47.814
The ones that say,

42:47.940 --> 42:51.067
"I think I could love you
anyway."

42:55.656 --> 43:01.411
- Imagine not existing
until a man needs you...

43:03.414 --> 43:09.377
Being there and yet not there.

43:09.503 --> 43:12.464
The face he wore
in the men's room,

43:12.590 --> 43:15.634
he couldn't take it off.

43:15.760 --> 43:20.096
Six days a week, he stood there,

43:20.222 --> 43:23.934
Saturdays a double shift.

43:24.060 --> 43:26.311
The sounds.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.022
How do you forget
the unmistakable sounds

43:29.148 --> 43:34.569
of urine into water,

43:34.695 --> 43:39.115
the rustle of newspapers
in the stalls,

43:39.241 --> 43:46.122
the rumble
of the toilet paper dispensers?

43:46.248 --> 43:51.628
All sounds magnified,
reverberating slightly.

43:53.130 --> 43:58.510
This was
my father's environment.

43:58.636 --> 44:02.472
- Top-rated historical hotel
in the state.

44:02.598 --> 44:06.017
The finest lobby,

44:06.143 --> 44:10.689
the single finest men's room
between the two coasts, surely:

44:10.815 --> 44:12.941
marble shipped from Italy,

44:13.067 --> 44:16.611
stall doors of seasoned cherry,

44:16.737 --> 44:20.657
scalloped basins,
opulent and echoing,

44:20.783 --> 44:22.784
all sounds amplified

44:22.910 --> 44:26.830
by the tile
and Florentine stone.

44:26.956 --> 44:28.289
- The odors,

44:28.416 --> 44:31.376
all the odors,

44:31.502 --> 44:35.672
odors as environment, all day,

44:35.798 --> 44:37.382
nine hours a day,

44:37.508 --> 44:40.635
standing there
in Good Humor white.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.887
It's what he stands in.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.056
Sonic center,

44:45.182 --> 44:48.226
The place where the shine stand
used to be,

44:48.352 --> 44:52.689
the place designed
for him to stand.

44:52.815 --> 44:55.150
- Just outside
of the large mirror's frame

44:55.276 --> 44:57.360
by the sink,

44:57.486 --> 45:00.697
a continuous sink of marble,

45:00.823 --> 45:04.159
leaves of gold foil
around the fixtures

45:04.285 --> 45:06.536
and mirrors.

45:06.662 --> 45:07.537
[door creaks]

45:07.663 --> 45:09.456
- This is his occupation.

45:09.582 --> 45:10.623
This is his career.

45:10.750 --> 45:13.752
He takes their briefcase
and their topcoats,

45:13.878 --> 45:18.423
guards them, remembers without
asking whose is whose,

45:18.549 --> 45:25.180
speaking as little as possible
in all those acoustics,

45:25.306 --> 45:30.310
appearing at men's elbows
to hand them a towel.

45:30.436 --> 45:34.606
This is my father's career.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.191
Why this?

45:36.317 --> 45:39.152
Why this tradition?

45:39.278 --> 45:43.114
- Large opulent room
for men of business,

45:43.240 --> 45:45.617
substantial men,

45:45.743 --> 45:49.329
men with places to go
and people to see.

45:49.455 --> 45:50.538
- Men of substance

45:50.664 --> 45:53.374
who flush the toilet
with their feet,

45:53.501 --> 45:56.711
men who will touch fixtures
only with tissue,

45:56.837 --> 46:00.215
men who blow their nose
in the sinks

46:00.341 --> 46:03.093
and walks off without rinsing.

46:03.219 --> 46:06.971
- The door tells
the whole story.

46:07.098 --> 46:09.474
"Men."

46:09.600 --> 46:13.728
The task is to stand there
as if you are not there.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.188
Not really.

46:15.314 --> 46:16.189
There's a trick.

46:16.315 --> 46:18.775
You hear everything,

46:18.901 --> 46:21.111
some tapping, some humming,

46:21.237 --> 46:23.154
some speaking aloud
to themselves,

46:23.280 --> 46:25.990
forgetting they are not alone.

46:26.117 --> 46:28.660
- Imagine to attend,

46:28.786 --> 46:33.206
to see men of substance
at their most elemental.

46:33.332 --> 46:36.960
This is his career,
a career man.

46:37.086 --> 46:41.297
And, yes,
do I admire the fortitude

46:41.423 --> 46:46.010
of this humblest of working men,
stoicism,

46:46.137 --> 46:48.805
the old-world grit,

46:48.931 --> 46:52.976
standing there all these years,
never a day sick,

46:53.102 --> 46:56.521
serving?

46:56.647 --> 47:00.859
Or do I despise him?

47:00.985 --> 47:03.153
You're wondering.

47:03.279 --> 47:05.864
Feel disgust?

47:05.990 --> 47:09.617
- Men who tip,
men who do not tip,

47:09.743 --> 47:12.954
millionaires who don't
wash their hands,

47:13.080 --> 47:15.373
heirs who steal towels,

47:15.499 --> 47:18.543
tycoons who pick their noses
with their thumb,

47:18.669 --> 47:22.213
philanthropists who throw
cigar butts on the floor,

47:22.339 --> 47:25.550
self-made men
who spit in the sink.

47:25.676 --> 47:29.179
- Plain white shirt
and white pants

47:29.305 --> 47:31.556
and white shoes
he'd have to throw out

47:31.682 --> 47:35.560
if so much as a spot-

47:35.686 --> 47:38.313
He bleached his work clothes
himself

47:38.439 --> 47:39.522
and ironed them.

47:39.648 --> 47:44.527
Never a word of complaint.

47:44.653 --> 47:51.159
- Food on the table, a roof,

47:51.285 --> 47:54.120
children to educate.

47:54.246 --> 47:57.248
A double shift, if I could.

48:02.129 --> 48:06.466
- His arches would swell
from the standing.

48:06.592 --> 48:12.138
He showered three times daily,
scrubbed himself raw.

48:12.264 --> 48:16.517
But the job still followed him.

48:16.644 --> 48:20.772
Never a word.

48:20.898 --> 48:25.109
- Every morning up at 6:00.

48:25.236 --> 48:28.404
Kiss you all good-bye.

48:28.530 --> 48:34.452
A piece of toast for the bus.

48:37.039 --> 48:43.253
- He stands there
when it's empty too.

48:44.630 --> 48:49.717
I haven't seen my father
since 1978.

48:49.843 --> 48:56.182
And I know he's still there,
all in white,

48:56.308 --> 48:59.811
standing,

48:59.937 --> 49:07.944
averting his eyes
to preserve their dignity.

49:13.617 --> 49:16.828
I wear nothing white,

49:16.954 --> 49:22.166
not one white thing.

49:22.293 --> 49:31.175
I eliminate in silence
or not at all.

49:31.302 --> 49:36.431
I tip.

49:36.557 --> 49:39.559
I never forget someone is there.

49:43.105 --> 49:45.106
[knocking]

49:53.657 --> 49:54.532
- Hi.

49:54.658 --> 49:55.533
- Hello, Daniel.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.076
Is there something
I can help you with?

49:57.202 --> 49:59.454
- Yeah, well,
I finally got my paper back.

49:59.580 --> 50:02.123
I was wondering whether
we could talk about it.

50:02.249 --> 50:03.708
- Well, Daniel,
right now I'm actually

50:03.834 --> 50:05.084
in the middle
of my own research.

50:05.210 --> 50:06.878
- What didn't you like?

50:07.004 --> 50:08.004
- I'm sorry?

50:08.130 --> 50:10.381
- Which parts didn't you like?

50:10.507 --> 50:12.050
- Daniel, it's not that
I didn't like it.

50:12.176 --> 50:14.385
My comments are based
more on your presentation.

50:14.511 --> 50:16.929
- What does that mean,
my presentation?

50:17.056 --> 50:19.098
Did it upset you?

50:19.224 --> 50:20.099
- Did it what?

50:20.225 --> 50:21.809
No, it didn't upset me.

50:21.935 --> 50:26.439
It certainly was provocative,
but that's never bad.

50:26.565 --> 50:29.734
And certain points
you made were-

50:29.860 --> 50:31.694
- Which was your favorite?

50:31.820 --> 50:33.905
- My favorite?

50:34.031 --> 50:35.573
- Well, I think it's important
for me to know

50:35.699 --> 50:38.659
which parts of the paper
pushed the limits.

50:38.786 --> 50:40.370
I don't want to be accused
of doing something

50:40.496 --> 50:41.788
just for shock value.

50:44.333 --> 50:47.335
- Okay.

50:51.006 --> 50:54.133
"Who are we to say getting
incested or abused or violated

50:54.259 --> 50:55.843
"or any of those things
can't also have

50:55.969 --> 50:59.639
their positive aspects
in the long run?"

50:59.765 --> 51:04.435
Now, that's shocking,
especially as a woman.

51:04.561 --> 51:08.106
- See, you-you misunderstood
what I was saying.

51:08.232 --> 51:09.607
Look, I guess all
I was trying to say is,

51:09.733 --> 51:12.944
you have to be careful
of taking a knee-jerk attitude.

51:13.070 --> 51:14.946
I think a knee-jerk attitude
to anything is a mistake,

51:15.072 --> 51:16.656
especially in the case of women,

51:16.782 --> 51:20.118
where it adds up to this very
limited and condescending thing

51:20.244 --> 51:21.953
of saying they're fragile,

51:22.079 --> 51:24.288
breakable things
that can be destroyed easily.

51:24.415 --> 51:29.043
Everybody gets hurt and violated
and broken sometimes.

51:29.169 --> 51:31.796
Why are women so special?

51:31.922 --> 51:34.132
Not that anybody ever
ought to be raped or abused.

51:34.258 --> 51:35.133
Nobody's saying that.

51:35.259 --> 51:40.388
But that's while it's going on.

51:40.514 --> 51:43.975
What about afterwards?

51:44.101 --> 51:44.976
All I'm saying is,

51:45.102 --> 51:48.312
there are certain cases
where it can enlarge you

51:48.439 --> 51:50.189
or make you more
of a complete human being,

51:50.315 --> 51:51.441
like Victor Frankl.

51:51.567 --> 51:52.442
- What?

51:52.568 --> 51:53.776
- Well think about
the Holocaust.

51:53.902 --> 51:54.777
- Daniel, that's-

51:54.903 --> 51:56.320
- Was the Holocaust
a good thing? No way.

51:56.447 --> 51:58.364
Does anybody think that
it was good that it happened?

51:58.490 --> 51:59.407
No, of course not.

51:59.533 --> 52:01.284
But did you read Victor Frankl,

52:01.410 --> 52:02.994
Victor Frankl's
Man's Search For Meaning?

52:03.120 --> 52:05.246
It's a great, great book.

52:05.372 --> 52:07.832
But it comes out
of his experience.

52:07.958 --> 52:12.920
It's about his experience
in the human dark side.

52:13.046 --> 52:15.631
Now, think about it.

52:15.757 --> 52:18.134
If there was no Holocaust,

52:18.260 --> 52:21.345
there'd be no
Man's Search For Meaning.

52:24.308 --> 52:27.685
- Why don't we talk about this
at office hours?

52:31.982 --> 52:33.191
- Hi, Miss Quinn-
- Daniel, I'm-

52:33.317 --> 52:34.817
- You said to meet
at office hours.

52:34.943 --> 52:35.860
- I'm in the middle of work.

52:35.986 --> 52:37.361
You can't just walk
right into the room.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.864
- I just want to know why
you hate it so much.

52:39.990 --> 52:40.865
- Fine.

52:40.991 --> 52:41.866
I thought it was easy.

52:41.992 --> 52:44.202
I thought your claims about
women were wild and incendiary,

52:44.328 --> 52:46.287
and I think you absolutely
wrote it for shock value.

52:46.413 --> 52:47.288
And quite frankly,

52:47.414 --> 52:49.415
I'm not interested
in discussing any further

52:49.541 --> 52:51.834
some paper that exemplifies
some pent-up,

52:51.960 --> 52:54.420
overdeveloped teen angst.

52:54.546 --> 52:57.006
- I'm impressed my paper
got to you like that.

52:57.132 --> 52:58.966
- Daniel, I don't think
you understand.

52:59.092 --> 53:00.426
There is no point.

53:00.552 --> 53:01.427
No one cares.

53:01.553 --> 53:03.888
- Careful.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.139
That's not true.

53:05.265 --> 53:06.891
Think about it.

53:07.017 --> 53:07.892
- Think about what?

53:08.018 --> 53:09.101
- About being degraded
and brought

53:09.228 --> 53:10.686
to within an inch of your life,
for example.

53:10.812 --> 53:12.980
No one's gonna say
the sick bastards that did it

53:13.106 --> 53:14.065
shouldn't be put in jail.

53:14.191 --> 53:16.400
But let's put two things
into perspective here.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.819
One is, afterwards, she knows
something about herself

53:18.946 --> 53:20.154
that she never knew before.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.322
All I'm saying is,

53:21.448 --> 53:23.866
there are certain cases
where it can enlarge you.

53:23.992 --> 53:26.577
What she knows is that
the most totally terrible,

53:26.703 --> 53:28.037
terrifying thing
that she could ever

53:28.163 --> 53:32.208
have imagined happening to her
has now happened.

53:32.334 --> 53:33.334
And she survived.

53:33.460 --> 53:34.502
She's still here.

53:34.628 --> 53:36.254
Make you more
of a complete human being,

53:36.380 --> 53:37.421
like Victor Frankl.

53:37.548 --> 53:40.174
And now she knows something.

53:40.300 --> 53:43.261
I mean, she really,
really knows.

53:43.387 --> 53:47.098
- Now, that's shocking,
especially as a woman.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.099
- No.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.934
See, I'm disappointed in you.

53:50.060 --> 53:52.770
That's what I'm talking about,
the knee-jerk attitude,

53:52.896 --> 53:54.397
Taking everything I say
and filtering it

53:54.523 --> 53:55.940
through your narrow view
of the world.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.692
Look, totally terrible
things happen.

53:57.818 --> 54:00.152
- Now, you want my opinion?

54:00.279 --> 54:02.613
- Existence and life
break people in all kinds

54:02.739 --> 54:04.574
of awful fucking ways
all the time.

54:04.700 --> 54:05.616
Trust me, I know.

54:05.742 --> 54:06.701
I've been there.

54:06.827 --> 54:08.578
And this is the big difference,
you and me here,

54:08.704 --> 54:10.162
because this isn't
about politics

54:10.289 --> 54:11.747
or feminism or whatever.

54:11.873 --> 54:13.124
For you, this is just ideas.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.542
You've never been there.

54:14.668 --> 54:15.543
- Sara.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.795
Can I talk to you a sec?

54:19.923 --> 54:23.009
- I'm not saying nothing bad
has ever happened to you.

54:23.135 --> 54:25.803
You're not bad-looking.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.139
I'm sure there's been some sort
of degradation or whatever

54:28.265 --> 54:29.140
come your way in life.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.182
But I'm talking

violation and terror
and suffering here,

54:34.479 --> 54:36.480
the real dark side.

54:36.607 --> 54:37.898
- Daniel came
into my office today.

54:38.025 --> 54:39.859
- Professor, let me explain-

54:39.985 --> 54:43.154
- He said that he was looking
to talk to you about his paper.

54:43.280 --> 54:50.494
- I can tell from just looking
at you, you never.

54:50.621 --> 54:53.623
Wouldn't even wear
what you're wearing.

54:53.749 --> 54:54.832
Trust me.

54:54.958 --> 54:57.168
- Listen, I just wanted you to
know that I'm taking care of it.

54:57.294 --> 55:00.004
I basically told him to,
you know, give it another shot.

55:00.130 --> 55:01.631
I know how persistent he can be.

55:01.757 --> 55:05.384
- Miss Quinn.

55:05.510 --> 55:07.386
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

55:07.512 --> 55:08.512
- There's just one more thing

55:08.639 --> 55:10.806
I feel like I have to tell you
about first, though.

55:13.310 --> 55:16.145
- What if I told you it was
my own sister that was raped?

55:18.065 --> 55:19.690
What if I told you
a little story

55:19.816 --> 55:24.862
about a 16-year-old girl
who went to the wrong party

55:24.988 --> 55:26.614
with the wrong guy

55:26.740 --> 55:31.369
and four of his buddies
that ended up doing to her

55:31.495 --> 55:33.954
just about everything
four guys could do to you

55:34.081 --> 55:35.373
in terms of violation.

55:35.499 --> 55:36.874
- "Here we go, bitch.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.376
Here we go!"

55:38.502 --> 55:41.671
- But if you could ask her

55:41.797 --> 55:45.633
if she could go into her head
and, and forget it or, like,

55:45.759 --> 55:48.010
erase the tape of it happening
in her memory,

55:48.136 --> 55:51.222
what do you think she'd say?

55:51.348 --> 55:52.682
Are you so sure what she'd say?

55:52.808 --> 55:56.143
That's while it's going on.

55:56.269 --> 55:57.478
What about afterwards?

55:57.604 --> 55:59.271
What if she said
that even after that,

55:59.398 --> 56:01.023
totally negative
as what happened was,

56:01.149 --> 56:04.110
at least now she understood
it was possible.

56:04.236 --> 56:05.569
People can.

56:05.696 --> 56:06.779
- Can what?

56:06.905 --> 56:09.448
- Can see you as a thing,

56:09.574 --> 56:11.742
that people can see you
as a thing.

56:11.868 --> 56:13.077
Do you know what that means?

56:13.203 --> 56:14.495
- Men are mostly shits.

56:14.621 --> 56:15.496
It's true.

56:15.622 --> 56:18.040
- Because if you can really just
see somebody as a thing,

56:18.166 --> 56:19.250
you can do anything to him.

56:19.376 --> 56:20.626
- And I know,
I know a better guy

56:20.752 --> 56:21.877
probably would've
told you about this

56:22.003 --> 56:23.462
before we even slept together.

56:23.588 --> 56:26.215
- What would it be like
to be able to be like that?

56:26.341 --> 56:27.717
You see, you think you can
imagine it,

56:27.843 --> 56:29.009
but you can't.

56:29.136 --> 56:30.177
But she can.

56:30.303 --> 56:31.971
And now she knows something.

56:35.058 --> 56:35.933
- Sorry.

56:36.059 --> 56:37.601
I tried calling earlier.

56:37.728 --> 56:41.272
- I mean she really,
really knows.

56:41.398 --> 56:45.735
- You cut your hair.

56:45.861 --> 56:46.944
It looks good.

56:47.070 --> 56:48.279
- This is what you wanted
to hear.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.114
You wanted to hear
about four drunk guys

56:50.240 --> 56:52.658
who knee jerked you in the balls
to make you bend over

56:52.784 --> 56:55.035
that you didn't even know,
that you never saw before,

56:55.162 --> 56:58.330
that you never did anything to,
that don't even know your name,

56:58.457 --> 57:00.499
that don't even know your name,

57:00.625 --> 57:03.294
to find out you have to choose
to have a fucking name.

57:03.420 --> 57:05.045
You have no fucking idea!

57:05.172 --> 57:08.090
And what if I said
that happened to me?

57:13.638 --> 57:16.766
Would that make a difference?

57:20.479 --> 57:22.188
- Why don't we talk about this
at office hours?

57:22.314 --> 57:24.523
- Okay.

57:24.649 --> 57:26.317
Office hours this week?

57:26.443 --> 57:28.068
- Yes.

57:28.195 --> 57:32.406
- Good luck.

57:42.959 --> 57:44.585
- What does today's woman want?

57:45.837 --> 57:47.213
- They want to be autonomous.

57:49.216 --> 57:52.343
- Basically, it's all still
an elaborate semiotic code.

57:52.469 --> 57:54.136
And the only way not
to get lost in the code

57:54.262 --> 57:57.348
is to approach the whole issue
logically.

57:57.474 --> 58:01.727
- They want you to understand
the bind that they're in.

58:01.853 --> 58:02.728
- Wait.

58:02.854 --> 58:03.854
I want to-

58:03.980 --> 58:08.442
I don't mean any of this in just
another Neanderthal male

58:08.568 --> 58:10.861
trying to put women down
'cause he's too insecure.

58:10.987 --> 58:12.404
And I'd go to the wall

58:12.531 --> 58:15.032
to defend them
against any scorn

58:15.158 --> 58:16.450
or culpability for a situation

58:16.576 --> 58:17.827
which is clearly
not their fault.

58:17.953 --> 58:19.328
- You can go nuts
trying to figure out

58:19.454 --> 58:20.371
which tack to take.

58:20.497 --> 58:22.873
I mean, they might go for it.
They might not.

58:22.999 --> 58:24.500
Today's woman is a total mess.

58:24.626 --> 58:26.794
I don't suppose you know where
the little wranglers' room is

58:26.920 --> 58:28.045
in this place, do you?

58:28.171 --> 58:30.339
- The solution is to understand
today's woman.

58:30.465 --> 58:32.883
- I mean, 'cause it's getting
time to answer Nature's page,

58:33.009 --> 58:34.802
if you know what I mean.

58:34.928 --> 58:35.928
The solution is to realize

58:36.054 --> 58:39.056
that today's woman is in
an impossible situation

58:39.182 --> 58:40.349
and wants what
any human being

58:40.475 --> 58:42.643
faced with two conflicting sets
of responsibilities

58:42.769 --> 58:45.145
is gonna want:
a way out.

58:45.272 --> 58:50.568
- An escape hatch.

58:50.694 --> 58:53.445
- A passionate male.

58:53.572 --> 58:58.826
- They want to be overwhelmed
with passion.

58:58.952 --> 58:59.869
- When they say,

58:59.995 --> 59:01.579
"I am responsible
for my own sexuality;

59:01.705 --> 59:02.746
"I am my own person;

59:02.873 --> 59:05.958
I don't need a man,"

59:06.084 --> 59:09.712
what they really
are telling you is

59:09.838 --> 59:15.676
what they want you
to make them forget, which is-

59:15.802 --> 59:16.677
what they're telling you

59:16.803 --> 59:18.470
is what they want you
to make them forget.

59:18.597 --> 59:19.972
They want-

59:20.098 --> 59:24.894
- Thank you.

♪ ♪

59:45.624 --> 59:51.629
- Hey.

59:51.755 --> 59:55.341
I decided to get help.

59:55.467 --> 59:58.510
I got in touch with the fact
that the problem

59:58.637 --> 01:00:02.890
had nothing to do with her.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.600
I saw that she would forever

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:06.352
go on playing victim
to my villain.

01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:09.021
I was-

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:13.567
I was powerless to change her.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:16.028
- Mind if I turn this on?

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.029
- No.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.030
- Great.
Thanks.

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:21.659
- Sure.

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:24.954
My own father was,
you might say,

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.959
a man who was,
by natural proclivity,

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:34.505
not a good man
but who nevertheless

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:37.633
tried diligently
to be a good man,

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:41.428
temper and so forth.

01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:49.228
My father's proclivity for rage
grew over a period of time.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:53.357
And eventually,

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:57.361
he resorted, after periods
of unsuccessful counseling,

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.321
to the practice

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:04.284
of handcuffing his own wrists
behind his back

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:10.165
whenever he would lose
his temper with any of us.

01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:15.337
This self-restraint

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:21.218
eventually progressed
over a period of years,

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:25.472
such that the more enraged
he might become with any of us,

01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:29.727
the more coercively he began
to restrain himself.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:33.105
Often the day would end
with the poor man

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.024
hogtied
on the living room floor,

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:40.487
screaming furiously at us,

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:46.243
trying to get the gag in
without getting bitten.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:49.204
Whatever possible use
that piece of history might be

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:54.293
to anyone not privileged
to have been there.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.627
And now I look at her,

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:59.590
and I promised myself as a kid-

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:03.260
I told myself
I would love my woman.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:06.930
And even now-
and I try so hard.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:15.773
And she's the one-she-

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:20.277
she always says
that she can save me.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:24.239
And I think,
"There's no excuse."

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:27.910
I know that.

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:33.457
I think, "I have promised myself
to this woman.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:40.255
I have promised to love her."

01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:43.050
But whatever.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:46.970
Now we can explain
my proclivities

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.180
and trace their origins

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:52.309
and have it all tied up all nice
and tight and tidy for you.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.310
Can't we?

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:56.772
- No, wait.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:59.817
I know it may sound ridiculous,
but I know that she can.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.485
- Can what?

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:02.820
- Save you.

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:09.076
- You don't know what I've done.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:16.583
- Do you want me
to start it for you?

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:19.253
It was a large outdoor concert
community festival thing.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:20.754
- Stop.
- And then you saw her there...

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.755
- Stop!

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:23.757
- Sitting on a blanket
with her amused expression.

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:25.050
- Stop.
- And then you fucked her.

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:26.552
- Stop!
- I got all of that.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:28.011
But there has to be
something more.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:31.056
I don't understand.

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:37.771
How could you do it?

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:38.856
We were in love.

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:41.984
- No, we weren't.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.458
Look, Sara, I know you.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:02.588
I'm aware of how all this sounds
and can well imagine

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:03.797
the judgments you're forming.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:07.050
But if I'm really
to explain this to you

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:12.097
then I have no choice
but to be candid.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.810
Yes, it was a pickup.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.187
Plain and simple.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:24.067
And she was what one might call
a granola cruncher, a hippie.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.403
And she was straight
out of central casting:

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:30.240
the sandals,
flamboyantly long hair,

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.951
financial support from parents
she reviled,

01:04:33.077 --> 01:04:34.286
and some professed membership

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:37.497
in a apostrophe-heavy
Eastern religion

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:42.211
that I would defy anyone
to pronounce correctly.

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:44.922
Look, I'll just bite
the political bullet

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.298
and confess
that I classified her

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.217
as a strictly
one-night objective,

01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:50.052
and that my interest in her

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:52.888
was due almost entirely
to the fact that, yes,

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:54.264
she was pretty.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.557
She was sexually attractive.

01:04:55.683 --> 01:04:58.101
She was sexy.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:02.147
And it was really nothing more
complicated or noble than that.

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:04.816
And having had
some prior dealings

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:05.901
with the cruncher genus,

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:07.945
I think the one-night proviso
was due

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.905
mostly to the grim
unimaginability

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:12.199
of having to talk with her
for more than one night.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.910
Whether or not you approve,

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:18.664
I think we can assume
you understand.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:20.040
And there's something
in the way,

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:24.169
I mean, a near contempt
in the way that you can

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:27.047
casually saunter over
to her blanket

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.423
and create the sense
of connection

01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:30.926
that will allow you
to pick her up.

01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:35.639
And you almost resent the fact
that it's so goddamn easy.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:39.810
I mean, how exploitative
you feel that it is so easy

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:45.315
to get this type to regard you
as a kindred soul.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.276
I mean, you almost know what's
going to be said

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.987
before she even opens her mouth.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.615
Okay.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.285
So now, there we are
in my apartment,

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:59.162
and she begins going on
about her religious views,

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:03.208
her obscure denomination's views
on energy fields

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.502
and connections between souls

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.171
via what she kept calling
"focus."

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.049
And in response to some sort
of prompt or association,

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:13.552
she begins to relate
this anecdote.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:19.349
And in the anecdote,
there she is, hitchhiking.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.686
Well, she said she knew
she made a mistake

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:26.315
the moment she got in the car.

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:29.026
Her explanation was
that she didn't actually feel

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.028
any energy field until she
had shut the car's door

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.113
and they were moving,

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.865
at which point it was too late.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.450
And she wasn't melodramatic
about it,

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:37.617
but she described herself

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:40.954
as literally paralyzed
with terror.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.374
It was something
about his eyes.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.711
She said she knew instantly
in the depths of her soul

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:51.131
that this man's intentions were
to brutally rape,

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:54.134
torture, and kill her

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.053
and that by the time
the psychotic

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.637
had exited into a secluded area

01:06:57.764 --> 01:06:59.973
and actually said
what his true intentions were,

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:01.391
she wasn't the least bit
surprised,

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:02.642
because she knew

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:05.562
that she was going to be just
another grisly discovery

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:09.107
for some amateur botanist
or scout troop a few days later,

01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:13.862
unless she could focus her way
into a soul connection

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:18.075
that would prevent this man
from murdering her.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.244
I mean, to focus intently
on this psychotic

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.246
as an ensouled and beautiful,

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.916
albeit tormented person,
in his own right

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:28.752
rather than merely
as a threat to her.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.129
And I'm well aware that what
she is about describe

01:07:31.255 --> 01:07:32.130
is nothing more

01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:35.550
than a variant of the stale old
"love will conquer all."

01:07:35.676 --> 01:07:36.760
But for the moment,

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.721
just bracket your contempt
and try to see

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:42.099
what she actually has
the courage and conviction

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:44.601
to really attempt here,

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.020
because imagine what it
must have felt like for her,

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:49.439
for anyone.

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.441
Contemplate just how

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.527
little-kid-level scared
you'd be...

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:57.948
that this psychotic
could bring you to this point

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.574
simply by wishing it.

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.451
And now here she is, in the car.

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:04.371
And she's realizing that she's
in for the biggest struggle

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:05.539
of her spiritual life.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:08.625
She stares directly
into the psychopath's right eye

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:11.002
and wills herself to keep
her gaze on him

01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:12.504
directly at all times.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:15.048
And the effects of her focus,

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.968
she says that when she was able
to hold her focus,

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:21.513
the psychopath behind the wheel
would gradually stop ranting

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.473
and become tensely silent.

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:26.518
And she wills herself
not to weep or plead

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:31.898
but merely to use focus
as an opportunity to empathize.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:33.608
And this was my first hint
of sadness

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.527
in listening to the anecdote,

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:39.698
'cause I found myself admiring
certain qualities in her story

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:42.075
that were the same qualities
I had been contemptuous of

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:44.661
when I first picked her up
in the park.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.832
And then he asks her
to get out of the car

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.917
and lie prone on the ground.

01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:54.171
And she doesn't hesitate or beg.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.631
She was experiencing
a whole new depth of focus.

01:08:56.756 --> 01:09:01.303
She said she could hear the tick
of the cooling car, bees, birds.

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:03.513
Imagine the temptation
to despair

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:05.474
in the sound
of carefree birds

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.185
only yards from where you lay
breathing in the weeds.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.394
And in this heightened state,

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.770
she said she could feel
the psychotic realizing

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:14.899
the truth of the situation
at the same time she did.

01:09:15.026 --> 01:09:18.487
When he came over to her
and turned her over,

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:20.863
he was crying.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.033
And she claimed it took
no effort of will

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:25.911
to hold him as he wept

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:29.747
as he raped her.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:34.752
She just stared into his eyes
lovingly the entire time.

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:37.546
She stayed where he left her
all day in the gravel,

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:41.551
weeping and giving thanks
to her religious principles.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:46.765
She wept out of gratitude,
she says.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.015
Well, I don't mind telling you.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:51.144
I had begun to cry
at the story's climax.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.438
Not loudly, but I did.

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:56.775
She had learned more about love
that day with the sex offender

01:09:56.901 --> 01:10:01.154
than in any other stage
of her spiritual journey.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.739
And I realized in that moment

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:05.575
that I had never loved
anyone before.

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:09.079
She had addressed
the psychotic's core weakness,

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.248
the terror of a soul-exposing
connection

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:14.876
with another human being.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:17.921
[chuckles softly]

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.173
Nor is any of this
all that different

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:22.801
than a man sizing up
an attractive girl at a concert

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:24.678
and pushing all the right
buttons to induce her

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:26.888
to come home with him
and lighting her cigarettes

01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:29.849
and engaging in an hour
of post-coital chitchat,

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:32.310
seemingly very content
and close.

01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:33.687
But what he really wants to do

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:36.022
is give her a special
disconnected telephone number

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:37.941
and never contact her again.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:41.111
And that the reason for this
cold and victimizing behavior

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.905
is that the very connection
that he had worked so hard

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:48.785
to make her feel terrifies him.

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:52.455

I'm being with you here?

that you know.

I can see you forming judgments,

You're not the only one who can
read people, you know.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.246
And you know what?

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:34.539
It's because of her influence

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:39.002
that I am more sad for you
than pissed off,

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.963
because the impact of this story
was profound,

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:44.507
and I'm not even gonna begin
to describe it to you.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.552
Can you imagine how any
of this felt,

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:50.096
to look at her sandals
across the room on the floor

01:11:50.222 --> 01:11:52.932
and remember what I had thought
of them only hours before?

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.393
And I'd say her name
and she'd say, "What?"

01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:57.771
And I'd say her name again.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:11:58.938
Well, I'm not embarrassed.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:03.526
I don't care how
this sounds to you now.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:10.533
I mean, can you see how I could
not just let her go after this?

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.371
I just, I grabbed onto her skirt
and I begged her not to leave.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:16.122
And then I watched her
gently close the door

01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:19.542
and walk off barefoot
down the hall

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:24.130
and never seeing her again.

01:12:24.256 --> 01:12:25.340
That it didn't matter

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.801
that she was fluffy
or not terribly bright-

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:29.803
nothing else mattered.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:30.970
She had all of my attention.

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:35.517
I had fallen in love with her.

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:41.022
I believed that she
could save me.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:45.985
Well, I'm aware of how
all this sounds.

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:47.320
I can see that look
on your face.

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:49.280
And I know you.

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:52.033
And I know what you're thinking.

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:53.618
So ask it.

I said.

Ask it now.

in completely the wrong place.

what do you mean?

Everybody knows
how it affected women.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:18.995
I think the real opportunity
to learn something

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.830
is in looking at men.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:23.500
- Okay, I'll buy that.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.835
- So, I want to set up
interviews.

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.504
I want to get primary research.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:29.422

and everyone's
gonna want to know why.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.516
- Because I don't think
the truth about men

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.768
can be found in a book.

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:43.394
The real impact is specific.

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:49.609
about their desires
and their fears,

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:52.028
then I can begin to get answers.

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.030

you want answers to?

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.031
