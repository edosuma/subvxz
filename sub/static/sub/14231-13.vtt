It's a dream come true.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.453
Now first you need the very best

02:00.537 --> 02:02.872
high-tech equipment money can buy.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.042
Then really pile on the charcoal, see?

Makes tender steaks and crisper spuds.

02:08.670 --> 02:12.048
Ah, Sir, excuse me,
but according to the gauges,

02:12.132 --> 02:14.718
that's about three times too much fuel.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.179
[Pete] It's only a little charcoal.

02:58.136 --> 03:01.264
Excuse me, Mr. Astaire,
but when you're done dancing,

03:01.348 --> 03:03.308
the fire department would like a donation.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.018
And hurry it up with that barbecue!

you're one of Spoonerville's

03:14.736 --> 03:16.738

03:16.988 --> 03:18.406
I am?

03:18.490 --> 03:19.991
Well, of course I am!

03:20.075 --> 03:22.369
So help us raise a few simoleons

03:22.452 --> 03:23.745
for a new fire engine,

03:23.828 --> 03:26.956
and your name will appear on

03:31.544 --> 03:32.504
Awk!

03:35.423 --> 03:38.301
Would this plaque be on the new engine?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.553
A brilliant idea.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.139

04:39.696 --> 04:41.740
Yes... We could use a young turk like you

04:51.875 --> 04:54.878
But, chief, we don't have any honorary...

04:55.879 --> 04:56.963
Ow!

04:57.047 --> 05:00.800
The position could be yours
for a very small donation

05:00.884 --> 05:03.303

[Chief] Yes, well,
your duties as an honorary fireman

05:17.400 --> 05:19.110
consist of answering the phone

for a few more donations.

of donating to
your beloved fire department
