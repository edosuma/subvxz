fancy musicians, celebrities.</i>

02:24.153 --> 02:27.023

03:07.729 --> 03:09.629
<i>I already know some tricks

03:09.631 --> 03:11.131
<i>Cooking is way better

03:13.803 --> 03:15.903
<i>It's not that

03:15.905 --> 03:19.173
<i>I do. On the Internet.</i>

03:19.175 --> 03:22.144
<i>I never met them offline,
but who cares?</i>

03:31.020 --> 03:33.155
<i>Okay, let's focus
on my birthday cake.</i>

03:35.024 --> 03:37.024
I don't want to give them
any reason

03:37.026 --> 03:40.760
to open their mouths about,
you know, whatever.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.329
But what you
want them to do?

03:42.331 --> 03:44.264
I mean, they're...
That's what they are.

03:44.266 --> 03:48.969
They're old, grumpy,
they give us a hard time,

03:48.971 --> 03:50.670
but they're our family,
and we love them.

03:50.672 --> 03:53.140
What's that?

03:53.142 --> 03:55.943
- It's a cake.
- Wait. A cake?

03:55.945 --> 03:58.178
You did the cake on your own
birthday? That's amazing.

03:58.180 --> 03:59.849
Yeah, I mean, I want to.

04:03.152 --> 04:04.751
There's no baking powder?

04:04.753 --> 04:06.686
Mm.

04:06.688 --> 04:08.022
I checked.
There's only baking soda.

04:08.024 --> 04:09.655
That's the same thing.

04:09.657 --> 04:12.026
No, Mom. Baking soda is
pure sodium bicarbonate.

04:12.028 --> 04:13.327
Speak English, please.

04:13.329 --> 04:15.129
I don't understand
what that means.

04:15.131 --> 04:17.730
Oh, here we go.
Cream of tartar.

04:17.732 --> 04:20.034
I can add this to baking soda
and make baking powder.

04:20.036 --> 04:21.835
Oh, no, I don't think
that's good.

04:21.837 --> 04:23.736
No, Mom, it's fine.

04:23.738 --> 04:25.806
This is the acid,
and baking soda is the base.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.374
When you mix them
and add liquid,

04:27.376 --> 04:29.877
it makes carbon dioxide,
which are bubbles,

04:29.879 --> 04:31.211
which is what you need
to make the cake rise.

04:31.213 --> 04:32.312
Basic chemistry.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.914
We're raising Walter White.

04:33.916 --> 04:35.382
Wait, are you actually sure
about that?

04:35.384 --> 04:37.051
That is never gonna work.

04:37.053 --> 04:39.019
Okay, I'll just use
the baking soda,

04:39.021 --> 04:40.287
but I don't think it'll rise.

04:40.289 --> 04:41.288
- Hello!
- Hi, Dad.

04:41.290 --> 04:43.023
Hi. Welcome.

04:43.025 --> 04:45.059
The Palestinian perspective
is largely untold.

04:45.061 --> 04:46.326
My op-ed speaks to that.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.962
Simply not true.

04:48.964 --> 04:51.832
That's because you only see
the truth you want to see.

04:51.834 --> 04:55.335
Israel is the only country,
besides the U.S.,

04:55.337 --> 04:58.405
that militarily occupied
another people.

04:58.407 --> 05:01.341
Fifty years now, Benjamin.
Fifty years.

05:01.343 --> 05:06.847
Your article does not have
the whole story.

05:08.184 --> 05:10.184
What's the latest in cat videos?

05:10.186 --> 05:15.089
Politics off the table... now.
Okay, Aba?

05:15.091 --> 05:18.425
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

05:22.264 --> 05:24.064
Cheers! Cheers, cheers, cheers.

05:24.066 --> 05:25.365
All right, eat up,
eat up, guys.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.201
Abe has been
working on this all day.

05:27.203 --> 05:29.269
- You made all this? Ooh!
- Yes!

05:29.271 --> 05:33.040
He's basically taken over
the whole kitchen, right, bubbe?

05:33.042 --> 05:34.174
I hope you guys like it.

05:34.176 --> 05:36.709
Yeah.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.046
These crazy noodle sandwiches
are the shit.

05:39.048 --> 05:40.746
It's a ramen taco.

05:40.748 --> 05:42.282
Of course it is!

05:42.284 --> 05:44.251
You are twelve.
Next year is a big one.

05:44.253 --> 05:47.287
If you do your bar mitzvah
next year,

05:47.289 --> 05:50.090
you will be a man!

05:50.092 --> 05:52.059
One hundred percent.

05:52.061 --> 05:54.795
All right, Aba,
sit down, all right.

05:54.797 --> 05:59.833
Well, I don't mean to interfere,
but it's the time.

05:59.835 --> 06:01.401
Yeah, no, thank you so much
for not interfering.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.137
I really appreciate that.

06:03.139 --> 06:08.275
Technically, you are a Jew
from your mother.

06:08.277 --> 06:11.812
Technically, he is a Muslim
because of his father.

06:11.814 --> 06:15.382
I'm sorry, is Atheism
matrilineal or patrilineal?

06:15.384 --> 06:18.118
- I don't know.
- Technically, I forgot.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.989
Yeah, so why don't we take this
off the table for now?

06:21.991 --> 06:24.091
Okay? We're done
with this conversation

06:24.093 --> 06:26.126
and this topic, okay?

06:26.128 --> 06:27.961
What the mother wants
is important.

06:27.963 --> 06:30.097
I want to.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.199
- Want to what?
- What?

06:32.201 --> 06:34.201
I want to do the bar mitzvah.

06:34.203 --> 06:38.472
Abe, Abe, Abe, hold on here.

06:38.474 --> 06:41.141
And the Muslim band.

06:41.143 --> 06:42.910
Just relax for one second.

06:42.912 --> 06:44.444
And everyone I know
is doing their bar mitzvahs.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.347
And like go to mosque
and stuff.

06:47.349 --> 06:49.216
Okay, that's
hell to the no.

06:49.218 --> 06:50.784
I can do both things.

06:50.786 --> 06:55.489
Habibi, you can try both,
but you cannot be both.

06:55.491 --> 06:59.860
Mm. You have to choose.

06:59.862 --> 07:02.829
You gotta get a live band
for you bar mitzvah

07:02.831 --> 07:04.998
- and a huge chocolate fountain!
- Uncle Ari!

07:05.000 --> 07:08.335
I'm so sorry, guys.
He doesn't have to choose...

07:08.337 --> 07:10.237
because we chose for him,
and we chose nothing.

07:10.239 --> 07:11.538
- Yeah, we chose nothing.
- Really?

07:11.540 --> 07:13.307
Yeah, really.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.749
It's time for cake!

07:23.085 --> 07:27.821
♪ Happy birthday to you

07:45.874 --> 07:47.174

Well... with what?
Imaginary candles, Mom?

08:01.523 --> 08:03.590
No, we'll go candles.
We'll do the song again.

08:03.592 --> 08:06.193
We'll do a Hebrew one
first, song...

08:06.195 --> 08:08.395
You need to leave the table.

Don't blame it
on my son, right?

08:27.516 --> 08:30.319
You can't choose

<i>Is family time supposed
to be something nice?</i>

08:35.157 --> 08:38.158

and can't even get it to rise?

09:00.316 --> 09:02.649
I mean, I did a better job
in my sixth-grade cooking class

09:02.651 --> 09:04.017
than that piece of shit.

09:04.019 --> 09:06.153
Did you have any idea

09:06.155 --> 09:09.990
that he wanted to try
a bar mitzvah or mosque?

09:09.992 --> 09:11.925
- Did you have any idea?
- Of course not.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.193
I thought we were
all enjoying

09:13.195 --> 09:15.262
a happy godless
existence together.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.099
Well, apparently we're not.

09:20.402 --> 09:23.337
You know what I think?

09:23.339 --> 09:25.272
I think he will never be Muslim

09:25.274 --> 09:26.340
or Jewish enough
for these people.

09:26.342 --> 09:28.241

out with your family too much.

09:43.459 --> 09:45.992
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:45.994 --> 09:48.228
You mean, spending time
with his dying grandmother?

09:48.230 --> 09:51.231
- Is that what you mean?
- No.

09:51.233 --> 09:52.199

you're pretty busy.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.422
Oh, thank you.

13:04.827 --> 13:09.229

kinda tastes like

13:15.137 --> 13:17.637

confusing, but...

13:32.688 --> 13:34.688

- I know.

Wait, wait, I'm going to camp?

15:03.012 --> 15:05.478
The thing is you can't
go around Brooklyn

15:05.480 --> 15:07.948
like you're on a frickin'
food tour, right?

15:07.950 --> 15:09.884
- That's true.
- Maybe I could work.

15:09.886 --> 15:11.685
Here you go.

15:11.687 --> 15:13.520
That's not funny.

15:13.522 --> 15:15.790
Oh. Wait a minute.

15:15.792 --> 15:18.658
Look, this actually looks good.
A cooking camp.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.861
That sounds like fun.

15:20.863 --> 15:23.396
- I guess.
- Yes! Okay.

15:23.398 --> 15:24.965
Maybe you'll meet some kids
who are into food and stuff.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.333
Make some new friends.

15:27.335 --> 15:30.336
It's not like an adult class
where I'm actually learn stuff.

15:30.338 --> 15:33.473
I'm sorry. Are you an adult?

15:33.475 --> 15:36.643
Can you work with us, please?
Okay? Humor me.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.511
It's that or UN.
Which one?

15:38.513 --> 15:39.816
UN! UN! Say UN.

15:42.684 --> 15:44.885
Now you take a cup

15:44.887 --> 15:49.990
and scoop it
into your bowl of sugar.

15:49.992 --> 15:54.494
So the food coloring makes
our desserts really colorful.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.763
Like if you put the blue
food coloring with the green

15:56.765 --> 15:59.432
and put it together,
you get yellow.

15:59.434 --> 16:03.070
Or you put the red and the blue
together, you get...

16:03.072 --> 16:05.405
<i>Excuse me, people,
I'm a professional chef.</i>

16:05.407 --> 16:07.373
<i>I can do that
with my eyes closed.</i>

16:07.375 --> 16:09.277
<i>#kissmyass.</i>

16:43.612 --> 16:46.080
Come on, let's go, guys!
Come on! Let's go!

16:46.082 --> 16:47.882
Let's do this.

16:47.884 --> 16:49.950
We gotta be out in three hours,

16:49.952 --> 16:51.384
We're gonna hit the streets
in three hours,

16:51.386 --> 16:51.954
and we're drippin' in here.

16:59.962 --> 17:01.496
Let's go, let's go,
come on, baby.

17:44.073 --> 17:46.075
Gonna go with the duck.

17:50.579 --> 17:52.581
Mmm!

18:14.703 --> 18:15.770
It's like music.

18:22.778 --> 18:23.777
Hey!

18:23.779 --> 18:25.846
- Sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey!

18:25.848 --> 18:27.580
American-Brooklyn!

18:27.582 --> 18:30.050
- Hey!
- Yeah, what are you doing here?

18:30.052 --> 18:31.787
I came here
to bring you something.

18:35.224 --> 18:38.893
Please, don't do that again.
On the ground.

18:38.895 --> 18:42.064
Oh, so, I've been trying
to cook fusion food.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.769
What is this, exactly?

18:49.771 --> 18:52.505
Well, it's a ramen taco.

18:52.507 --> 18:55.209
It's my take on the ramen taco.

18:55.211 --> 18:56.977
I was planning on
calling it, um...

18:56.979 --> 18:57.914
Terrible.

19:00.783 --> 19:03.984
Wait, wait, you didn't try it.
Just take a bite.

19:03.986 --> 19:05.618
Sorry, kid.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.589
You are mixing fusion
with confusion.

19:08.858 --> 19:10.858
You made something bold.

19:10.860 --> 19:14.094
Next time,
make something good to eat.

19:14.096 --> 19:15.630
Okay?

19:22.038 --> 19:23.904
Wait, well...

19:23.906 --> 19:26.943
maybe you can teach me.

19:29.711 --> 19:34.616
Does this look like
a summer camp for rich kids?

19:36.751 --> 19:38.052
Look around.

19:38.054 --> 19:40.156
No, not... not exactly.

19:41.824 --> 19:43.991
- Chico.
- Yeah?

19:43.993 --> 19:45.560
I got something for the yucca.

19:48.864 --> 19:50.097
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

19:50.099 --> 19:52.166
I'll give you chili paste.

19:52.168 --> 19:54.734
Malaguetas, man.
Blow your fucking face off.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.806
You think you got my people
to be on fire, huh?

19:59.141 --> 20:01.175
- Kid!
- What are you doing?

20:01.177 --> 20:03.043
- American-Brooklyn!
- Hey, hey, hey!

20:03.045 --> 20:05.212
Spicy.

20:05.214 --> 20:06.780
What did I say?

20:06.782 --> 20:08.150
Is that sriracha?

20:09.617 --> 20:10.985
Yes, it was.

20:10.987 --> 20:13.220
- It needs lime.
- Yeah.

20:13.222 --> 20:14.556
Hot! Comin' through!

20:16.926 --> 20:18.591
You have somewhere to be?

20:18.593 --> 20:22.863
Oh, um...
Uh, yeah, I'll...

20:22.865 --> 20:24.000
If you don't...

20:27.602 --> 20:31.005
I could use some help.

20:31.007 --> 20:35.976
Come every day during the week
for a few hours.

20:35.978 --> 20:37.344
Help out.

20:37.346 --> 20:39.679
I can teach you a few things.

20:39.681 --> 20:42.016
Really? That'd...
That'd be awesome!

20:42.018 --> 20:44.952
I'm running a tight ship.
Can you handle it?

20:44.954 --> 20:47.021
- Oh, I can! Totally!
- Okay!

20:47.023 --> 20:48.956
- I really appreciate the...
- Okay.

20:48.958 --> 20:50.357
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

20:50.359 --> 20:51.160
- Thank you so much
- You got it?

20:54.763 --> 20:55.697
Mm-mm.

21:00.635 --> 21:01.804
Goodbye.

21:03.839 --> 21:05.372
Bye.

21:05.374 --> 21:06.739
Bye.

21:06.741 --> 21:08.110
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

21:23.691 --> 21:24.858
All right, buddy,
here we are.

21:24.860 --> 21:26.060
Bye, guys.

21:26.062 --> 21:28.896
Wait a second! Wait, wait.

21:28.898 --> 21:31.865
I won't do this every day,
but I need a hug, I need a hug.

21:31.867 --> 21:34.068
I love you.
Straight home after school.

21:34.070 --> 21:36.003
You know the route.
Subway, two stops.

21:36.005 --> 21:37.404
- Okay.
- Love you. Bye.

21:37.406 --> 21:39.141
Come on, let's go.

21:40.209 --> 21:41.676
Bye!

22:23.052 --> 22:24.885
So where do we start?

22:24.887 --> 22:28.822
Yeah, we start when you
get those dishes washed.

22:28.824 --> 22:30.924
I need this clean.

22:30.926 --> 22:32.725
Right now, come on!
Let's go!

22:32.727 --> 22:34.928
We have a lot to do, you know.

22:34.930 --> 22:35.898
Oh, man.

22:46.942 --> 22:47.709
Put it there.

23:06.162 --> 23:07.263
Sorry.

23:11.967 --> 23:13.267
<i>Co-op kitchen, day two.</i>

23:13.269 --> 23:15.035
<i>Sao Paulo meets Harlem prep.</i>

23:15.037 --> 23:19.806
<i>And I met lots of flies,
garbage and dirty dishes.</i>

23:19.808 --> 23:20.841
<i>Good start.</i>

23:45.534 --> 23:47.367
<i>Co-op kitchen, day three.</i>

23:47.369 --> 23:51.305
<i>Day four, day five,
day six, day seven...</i>

23:51.307 --> 23:53.507
<i>Mastering the basics.</i>

23:53.509 --> 23:56.212
<i>Which means
still taking the trash out.</i>

24:01.784 --> 24:02.717
Abe!

24:04.954 --> 24:06.920
Trash time.

24:06.922 --> 24:08.155
Again?

24:08.157 --> 24:10.324
I thought...

24:10.326 --> 24:12.125
I thought you would
teach me some stuff.

24:12.127 --> 24:13.295
I am.

24:14.930 --> 24:16.530
About working in a kitchen.

24:16.532 --> 24:20.567
You master the basics first.

24:20.569 --> 24:23.470
You need. Okay?

24:23.472 --> 24:25.372
I thought that was like
the basics.

24:25.374 --> 24:26.909
Trash time.

24:28.277 --> 24:30.077
Yo, let's go, let's go!

24:30.079 --> 24:31.245
This too.

24:31.247 --> 24:33.413
We have less than an hour to go!

24:56.939 --> 25:00.374
<i>Got my balls busted these days.</i>

25:00.376 --> 25:02.109
<i>Still better than camp though.</i>

25:02.111 --> 25:04.211
<i>Much better.</i>

25:11.620 --> 25:12.619
Amen.

25:12.621 --> 25:14.454
Amen.

25:14.456 --> 25:15.524
Amen.

25:17.426 --> 25:19.960
- Can I have some?
- No.

25:19.962 --> 25:20.961
Just a sip.

25:20.963 --> 25:21.995
No!

25:21.997 --> 25:23.463
It's okay.

25:23.465 --> 25:26.533
You give him a little now,

25:26.535 --> 25:28.837
he won't grow up
to be a drunk.

25:32.074 --> 25:33.409
Okay.

25:35.144 --> 25:36.510
L'Chaim.

25:36.512 --> 25:37.880
- L'Chaim.
- L'Chaim.

25:42.351 --> 25:45.285
Okay. That's good.
Take it easy.

25:45.287 --> 25:47.089
- I had a sip!
- God!

25:49.658 --> 25:51.325
It's good.

25:51.327 --> 25:54.094
Sure, okay.
That's enough!

25:54.096 --> 25:55.364
- It smells good.
- Thank you.

25:57.433 --> 25:59.232
Is this all Savta's stuff?

25:59.234 --> 26:01.435
Yeah.

26:01.437 --> 26:04.538
- Oh, nice dress.
- Yeah.

26:04.540 --> 26:07.474
I had a farmer's tan because
we were in Israel that summer.

26:07.476 --> 26:09.411
We're not packing this away,
are we?

26:13.982 --> 26:16.616
Those recipes
are pretty great, right?

26:16.618 --> 26:18.452
Yeah, I love them.

26:18.454 --> 26:21.221
She was such a good cook.

26:21.223 --> 26:23.926
Guess it skipped a generation
and went straight to you.

26:27.196 --> 26:28.362
Take care of those, okay?

26:28.364 --> 26:30.997
I can have these?

26:30.999 --> 26:33.135
I think she'd want you
to have them.

26:37.005 --> 26:39.506
<i>Miss you, Grandma. Really.</i>

26:39.508 --> 26:42.175
<i>I guess people are not handling
your absence very well.</i>

26:42.177 --> 26:43.445
<i>Not at all.</i>

26:55.324 --> 26:57.190
<i>After lots of prep,</i>

26:57.192 --> 26:59.259
<i>it's time to
hit the streets with our food.</i>

26:59.261 --> 27:02.996
<i>I mean, Chico and
Chef Russell Chung's food.</i>

27:40.302 --> 27:42.436
<i>Chico doesn't allow me
to cook yet,</i>

27:42.438 --> 27:44.973
<i>but I'm in charge
of the lemonade.</i>

27:46.408 --> 27:49.242
<i>Okay, just the lemons.</i>

28:03.492 --> 28:04.724
<i>The best lemonade.</i>

28:04.726 --> 28:07.594
<i>Do not waste. Let's freeze.</i>

28:07.596 --> 28:09.429
Thank you, my friend.

28:09.431 --> 28:12.399
All right, here you go, Abe.

28:12.401 --> 28:13.801
That's it!

28:13.803 --> 28:15.535
Thanks.

28:15.537 --> 28:16.705
Oh, wait.

28:18.574 --> 28:20.207
Wait, is this made of pork?

28:20.209 --> 28:22.144
Yeah, why?

28:23.378 --> 28:25.712
Ah.

28:25.714 --> 28:27.581
Abe...

28:27.583 --> 28:31.786
religion, man, it...
it just divides us.

28:31.788 --> 28:34.588
This stuff,
none of it's logical.

28:34.590 --> 28:35.790
None of it makes any sense.

28:35.792 --> 28:38.793
Okay, but, I just...
I think I should...

28:38.795 --> 28:41.428
I don't want you to worry
about any of that stuff, okay?

28:41.430 --> 28:44.832
Hey, you're a great kid.

28:44.834 --> 28:46.368
Just be a great kid.

28:55.344 --> 28:58.478
- Well?
- Mmm.

28:58.480 --> 29:01.348
There's definitely enough cumin.
It just needs a little salt.

29:01.350 --> 29:02.284
Okay.

29:04.486 --> 29:06.319
Now?

29:06.321 --> 29:07.356
Yeah, that's good.

29:11.126 --> 29:13.326
What is it, habibi?

29:13.328 --> 29:17.497
I didn't fast, so does that mean
I shouldn't eat?

29:17.499 --> 29:21.635
I mean, if iftar means
to break the fast, then...

29:21.637 --> 29:22.870
Of course you can eat.

29:22.872 --> 29:26.506
Everyone can eat at iftar.

29:26.508 --> 29:31.046
And you are 12 now.
You are old enough to fast.

29:32.548 --> 29:34.849
Do you like it? Fasting?

29:34.851 --> 29:36.385
I do.

29:38.587 --> 29:41.187
You know,
it just seems hard to me.

29:41.189 --> 29:44.124
It's supposed to be.

29:44.126 --> 29:48.528
Clears the mind,
connects you with God.

29:48.530 --> 29:50.766
And it makes you tough.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.142
Amen.

30:08.517 --> 30:09.482
This looks great, Mom.

30:14.256 --> 30:17.792
You want something else
to drink, Ibrahim?

30:17.794 --> 30:20.694
Why don't... Why don't
Muslims drink wine?

30:20.696 --> 30:22.729
Wine?

30:22.731 --> 30:25.298
Yeah. I did it at my Shabbat.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.603
And saba says
that I'm old enough.

30:29.237 --> 30:32.505
We do not drink, habibi.
Muslims.

30:32.507 --> 30:33.841
There's no drinking.

30:33.843 --> 30:35.575
What? He does.

30:35.577 --> 30:37.646
I'm not Muslim.

30:42.284 --> 30:45.418
Alcohol dulls the intellect.

30:45.420 --> 30:47.356
Haven't you noticed that
in your father?

30:50.225 --> 30:51.491
This is great.

30:51.493 --> 30:53.662
- This is really, really good.
- Whoa!

30:55.330 --> 30:56.231
Oh!

31:01.470 --> 31:04.204
It is the state department's
definition.

31:04.206 --> 31:08.608
Criticize Israel,
you are anti-Semitic.

31:08.610 --> 31:10.310
I hate this word.

31:10.312 --> 31:11.478
Okay, Mom.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.513
I am not a Semite.

31:13.515 --> 31:16.282
The Jews, they are anti-Semitic
toward me.

31:16.284 --> 31:19.452
Wait, but doesn't
anti-Semitism mean

31:19.454 --> 31:21.688
you don't like Jewish people?

31:21.690 --> 31:25.826
"Semitic," it refers
to languages.

31:25.828 --> 31:29.229
Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic,
among others.

31:29.231 --> 31:30.931
There is a family
of Semitic languages

31:30.933 --> 31:33.333
that come from
where we come from.

31:33.335 --> 31:37.907
We belong to language,
and language belongs to us.

31:39.508 --> 31:40.542
Okay.

32:19.916 --> 32:21.581
- Hey, good morning!
- Good morning.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.050
You made it.

32:23.052 --> 32:24.985
I made it strong.

32:24.987 --> 32:26.053
Wow!

32:26.055 --> 32:27.855
Nice! Really good.

32:27.857 --> 32:29.322
- Good.
- Thank you.

32:29.324 --> 32:31.491
How are you today?

32:31.493 --> 32:32.659
Good. You?

32:32.661 --> 32:33.796
I'm good too.

32:37.532 --> 32:41.770
So any trash
I need to take out yet?

32:44.841 --> 32:47.041
Do you know
how to use a knife?

32:47.043 --> 32:48.641
Yeah, of course.

32:48.643 --> 32:50.911
Okay. Your turn.

32:50.913 --> 32:53.047
Be careful with your finger,
please.

32:53.049 --> 32:55.918
He'll be fine.
Start from the bottom.

32:58.888 --> 33:01.554
No, no, no!
Come on, come on, easy.

33:01.556 --> 33:02.923
Oh, my God.

33:02.925 --> 33:04.359
- That's all right.
- Sorry.

33:06.095 --> 33:08.028
Follow what I do.

33:08.030 --> 33:10.030
First of all,
you have a base,

33:10.032 --> 33:13.000
you cut it in your hand
and do like that.

33:13.002 --> 33:14.902
Okay.

33:14.904 --> 33:16.603
From the base first,
in your hand.

33:16.605 --> 33:18.873
Yes, exactly.

33:18.875 --> 33:20.074
Just like this.

33:20.076 --> 33:21.809
Like this? I got it.

33:21.811 --> 33:23.880
Yes. Be careful
with your fingers.

33:25.647 --> 33:27.347
- Yes!
- Yes!

33:27.349 --> 33:28.448
- That's really good!
- That's better.

33:28.450 --> 33:30.818
Go easy and you'll get it.

33:30.820 --> 33:35.355
Are we gonna get to taste any
of this stuff, or are we just...

33:35.357 --> 33:38.458
Okay, do your job first,
then we'll see.

34:07.389 --> 34:11.025
<i>After lots of learning
on how to handle garbage...</i>

34:11.027 --> 34:15.029
<i>curses, curses in Portuguese,
like "filho da puta,"</i>

34:15.031 --> 34:17.164
<i>washing dishes
and cutting yucca,</i>

34:17.166 --> 34:19.934
<i>I learned that, sometimes,
two plus two equals five.</i>

34:19.936 --> 34:22.435
<i>Or seven.</i>

34:22.437 --> 34:25.806
Draw a map.
A flavor map.

34:25.808 --> 34:28.876
Start by using ingredients
from the same land.

34:28.878 --> 34:31.580
<i>And connect the flavors
to create something unique.</i>

34:34.016 --> 34:36.984
<i>Chico said fusion
is about harmony.</i>

34:36.986 --> 34:38.986
<i>The best part is that
now I have an excuse</i>

34:38.988 --> 34:41.421
<i>to do lots of tasting
and trying.</i>

34:41.423 --> 34:43.556
<i>I need to find things that
match and complete each other.</i>

34:52.734 --> 34:57.037
<i>New dimensions,
like the five basic tastes:</i>

34:57.039 --> 34:58.638
<i>saltiness, sweetness,
bitterness,</i>

34:58.640 --> 35:00.875
<i>sourness and umami.</i>

35:00.877 --> 35:03.576
<i>This last one's only for pros.</i>

35:03.578 --> 35:07.016
<i>Mind map, flavor map,
master flavors.</i>

35:32.074 --> 35:34.609
<i>Great. I'm a recipe of success.</i>

35:38.014 --> 35:40.747
<i>I should see what
a bar mitzvah is like.</i>

36:11.948 --> 36:13.983
Some appetizers for you, guys.

36:15.251 --> 36:17.851
What's this?

36:17.853 --> 36:19.253
Samoa.

36:19.255 --> 36:22.158
Abe, those look good.
Have one.

36:27.562 --> 36:29.263
For your main course,

36:29.265 --> 36:33.000
we have the butternut squash
or the tortellini.

36:33.002 --> 36:35.668
Um, I'll take
the butternut squash.

36:35.670 --> 36:36.904
Same for me.

36:36.906 --> 36:39.672
Young man,
mac and cheese or pizza?

36:39.674 --> 36:41.108
Uh, no, thank you.

36:41.110 --> 36:42.575
Nothing?

36:42.577 --> 36:44.278
No, no, yeah, I'm good.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.048
What's the matter?
You love mac and cheese.

36:48.117 --> 36:49.185
I'm...

36:50.920 --> 36:51.919
I'm... I'm fasting.

36:51.921 --> 36:53.988
Fasting? Why?

36:53.990 --> 36:56.824
I mean, to practice.

36:56.826 --> 36:58.325
For what?

36:58.327 --> 37:00.928
I mean, I.,..

37:00.930 --> 37:02.729
It's for Ramadan.

37:02.731 --> 37:04.798
Abe...

37:04.800 --> 37:07.003
Not the right neighborhood,
but it's cool.

37:08.070 --> 37:10.039
Okay. Yep.

37:12.808 --> 37:15.109
- Mazel tov!
- Mazel tov!

37:15.111 --> 37:16.642
<i>What's the best place</i>

37:16.644 --> 37:19.246
<i>to accidentally meet
haters of my blog?</i>

37:19.248 --> 37:21.949
<i>Where they belong:
in the toilet.</i>

37:21.951 --> 37:24.018
Dude, I only made
five grand on mine.

37:24.020 --> 37:27.121
People are only giving me
18 or 36 dollars.

37:27.123 --> 37:28.889
Wait, wait, wait. Because...

37:28.891 --> 37:31.091
If you say any more
sanctimonious bile,

37:31.093 --> 37:33.360
we're gonna go.

37:33.362 --> 37:37.331
Hey, Abe,
I heard you're fasting.

37:37.333 --> 37:41.001
Uh, no, I'm...
My parents told me...

37:41.003 --> 37:43.105
Hey, maybe he has explosives
under there, you think?

37:45.374 --> 37:48.741
All right, how much
did you make at yours?

37:48.743 --> 37:49.843
What do you mean?

37:49.845 --> 37:51.845
You serious?

37:51.847 --> 37:53.280
Your bar mitzvah.

37:53.282 --> 37:55.184
You do it right,
you make a killing.

37:57.119 --> 37:59.019
- Aba.
- What?

37:59.021 --> 38:01.822
Why did you leave Israel?

38:01.824 --> 38:03.290
Our...

38:03.292 --> 38:05.926
Your grandmom...

38:05.928 --> 38:08.761
did not want our daughter
to fight in the army.

38:08.763 --> 38:11.764
I already did that for her.

38:11.766 --> 38:15.069
So then why did you fight,
in the first place?

38:15.071 --> 38:17.838
I always wanted to do my part.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.705
To make sure...

38:19.707 --> 38:22.876
that after thousands of years
of persecution,

38:22.878 --> 38:25.045
that would never happen again.

38:25.047 --> 38:27.047
I always thought of myself

38:27.049 --> 38:32.386
as defending our people
from another holocaust.

38:32.388 --> 38:34.855
Nowadays, with things
out of control,

38:34.857 --> 38:37.391
I'm not always so sure.

38:37.393 --> 38:42.662
Maybe your generation
can find some kind of peace.

38:42.664 --> 38:43.966
Yes?

38:49.905 --> 38:52.039
Did you have a good time?

38:52.041 --> 38:54.009
What did you like?

38:55.177 --> 38:56.178
Um...

38:59.248 --> 39:01.882
- I don't know. It was cool.
- What?

39:01.884 --> 39:04.384
His whole family
was into it, I guess.

39:04.386 --> 39:08.222
Yeah, that is cool.
Yeah, I know.

39:08.224 --> 39:12.392
Gosh, you know,
religion's so complicated.

39:12.394 --> 39:18.165
But sometimes, it can offer
insights into who you are.

39:18.167 --> 39:21.802
You know, the problem is
when it becomes literal.

39:21.804 --> 39:26.240
It's all about these metaphors,
you know?

39:26.242 --> 39:28.909
That stand for big ideas.

39:28.911 --> 39:30.710
What do you mean?

39:30.712 --> 39:34.848
Okay, so let's take heaven,
right?

39:34.850 --> 39:39.486
What if heaven is not
like a literal place you go to,

39:39.488 --> 39:43.723
but maybe an idea.

39:43.725 --> 39:47.327
A metaphor for living your life
lovingly and peacefully

39:47.329 --> 39:50.931
right here,
right on Earth, right?

39:50.933 --> 39:53.934
Do you believe that?

39:53.936 --> 39:57.239
It doesn't even matter
what I believe.

40:03.312 --> 40:05.379
We knew this could
come up one day.

40:05.381 --> 40:07.514
It's here, it's in our faces.

40:07.516 --> 40:10.951
This is so not you.
I'm just so surprised by you.

40:10.953 --> 40:13.387
I'm just asking you to be open.

40:13.389 --> 40:15.522
We cannot be
flexible on this.

40:15.524 --> 40:17.757
We have to protect him.

40:17.759 --> 40:19.960
Stop letting him be brainwashed,
"God this, God that."

40:19.962 --> 40:22.264
It's not about God.
It's about his identity.

40:32.408 --> 40:34.141
Sorry you had
to hear that.

40:34.143 --> 40:36.243
- Leave, please.
- Baby...

40:36.245 --> 40:39.046
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do, Mom.

40:39.048 --> 40:40.814
It's like I don't win
in either situation.

40:40.816 --> 40:43.450
If I do anything
from the Muslim side,

40:43.452 --> 40:45.252
then the Jewish side
is gonna be mad.

40:45.254 --> 40:47.354
And if I do anything
from the Jewish side,

40:47.356 --> 40:49.356
then the Muslim side
is gonna be mad.

40:49.358 --> 40:53.927
If I do anything from any side,
then Dad is just gonna be mad.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.896
And if I don't do anything
from either side,

40:55.898 --> 40:58.365
then you're just
gonna be mad.

40:58.367 --> 41:02.002
No one's mad at you, okay?
Just take it easy.

41:02.004 --> 41:04.071
This is all stuff
that we'll figure...

41:04.073 --> 41:06.342
Mom, are you listening to me?

41:19.088 --> 41:21.555
We gotta get this out the door.
Come on, guys.

41:21.557 --> 41:23.390
Get that and get these
in the oven, guys.

41:23.392 --> 41:24.960
Let's go, let's go.

41:38.907 --> 41:41.041
Abe.

41:41.043 --> 41:42.576
What's going on with you today?

41:42.578 --> 41:45.545
You're doing a shitty job. Why?

41:45.547 --> 41:48.181
I'm trying fasting
for Ramadan.

41:48.183 --> 41:49.451
Oh.

41:54.456 --> 41:56.292
A lot coming at you, huh?

41:58.127 --> 41:59.461
I guess.

42:00.963 --> 42:03.864
Well...

42:03.866 --> 42:06.600
you shouldn't cook
when you are in a bad mood.

42:06.602 --> 42:08.535
Why?

42:08.537 --> 42:10.472
Gets in the food.

42:13.108 --> 42:16.845
What about how you're always
cursing and yelling at Mandioca?

42:18.514 --> 42:20.549
Okay, take a break
and get a snack for us.

42:43.372 --> 42:44.971
It's from the leftover lemonade.

42:44.973 --> 42:46.175
You made this?

42:47.509 --> 42:48.975
Yeah.

42:48.977 --> 42:50.477
Hmm.

42:50.479 --> 42:54.047
So try it.
Tell me what you think.

42:54.049 --> 42:56.316
Is that thyme or mint?

42:56.318 --> 42:58.485
Thyme?

42:58.487 --> 42:59.521
Nice.

43:07.196 --> 43:08.195
Is it good?

43:08.197 --> 43:10.630
Oh, yeah.

43:10.632 --> 43:12.999
I could eat popsicles
like all day.

43:13.001 --> 43:14.534
Even in the winter,
I love them.

43:14.536 --> 43:18.071
This reminds me...

43:18.073 --> 43:19.274
my place.

43:20.442 --> 43:24.044
Bahia, Brazil.

43:24.046 --> 43:25.512
We used to be poor.

43:25.514 --> 43:27.614
We did not have
air conditioning like you.

43:32.187 --> 43:33.288
Hot, hot, hot.

43:41.730 --> 43:44.433
Well, Abe, I think you're
ready for the next step.

43:46.335 --> 43:47.469
I'm trusting you.

43:49.338 --> 43:51.071
You better
come on time tomorrow.

43:51.073 --> 43:53.106
Okay, think about
the staff meal.

43:53.108 --> 43:56.410
And opening up the place,
cleaning it up,

43:56.412 --> 43:58.712
and you will get started, okay?

43:58.714 --> 44:01.081
And well done. I like it.

44:01.083 --> 44:03.183
Cool?

44:03.185 --> 44:05.051
Yeah.

44:05.053 --> 44:06.488
Hey.

44:26.442 --> 44:27.741
Teta, can I borrow this?

44:27.743 --> 44:29.743
Yes, of course.

44:29.745 --> 44:32.112
You know, I'm going to
give it to you after I die.

44:32.114 --> 44:33.246
Teta!

44:33.248 --> 44:35.048
That's okay.

44:35.050 --> 44:35.617
Don't talk about that.

44:37.419 --> 44:39.152
Come help me.

44:39.154 --> 44:41.154
Hand me that big piece of lamb
over there.

44:41.156 --> 44:44.024
Oh, my God.
Why there is so much?

44:44.026 --> 44:47.260
We sacrifice a lamb.

44:47.262 --> 44:51.765
Look, we take a third
for ourselves,

44:51.767 --> 44:55.602
a third for the neighbor,
and a third for the poor.

44:55.604 --> 44:58.772
We always share, habibi, always.

44:58.774 --> 45:02.142
I am making this marinade
for shawarma.

45:02.144 --> 45:04.311
You're gonna take
some with you, huh?

45:04.313 --> 45:06.248
Very good.

45:09.518 --> 45:11.151
Wow. That's good.

45:11.153 --> 45:13.653
This is for you, habibi.

45:13.655 --> 45:18.260
You take this, and you make
something delicious, yes?

45:19.561 --> 45:20.627
Okay.

45:20.629 --> 45:22.364
Good. Very good.

45:25.802 --> 45:29.102
For the staff meal.

45:29.104 --> 45:30.838
It's shawarma.

45:30.840 --> 45:33.206
And my grandma made
the marinade,

45:33.208 --> 45:34.809
and I think she killed
the lamb too, so it's fresh.

45:34.811 --> 45:37.310
What is in the marinade?
Identify.

45:37.312 --> 45:42.251
Uh, garlic, cinnamon,
coriander...

45:44.119 --> 45:46.119
Definitely vinegar.

45:46.121 --> 45:48.555
Crazy thought.

45:48.557 --> 45:50.058
What if we put it
in a corn tortilla?

45:51.660 --> 45:53.527
Yeah, my friend,

45:53.529 --> 45:57.397
this is the right time
for your taco idea to work.

45:57.399 --> 46:00.166
<i>Co-op kitchen, day 18.</i>

46:00.168 --> 46:01.501
<i>Time to make staff meal.</i>

46:01.503 --> 46:02.602
<i>Big chance.</i>

46:02.604 --> 46:04.740
<i>I really need to make this fly.</i>

46:26.829 --> 46:28.461
Ready?

46:28.463 --> 46:29.431
Yup.

47:01.363 --> 47:03.699
- Can I open it now?
- Yeah.

47:10.372 --> 47:11.640
Thank you!

47:14.242 --> 47:16.242
Oh, this is awesome!

47:16.244 --> 47:17.945
So I get to keep this?

47:17.947 --> 47:20.881
Sure! It's yours.
Welcome to the team.

47:20.883 --> 47:23.216
- Yeah!
- Nice, kid!

47:23.218 --> 47:24.618
You're part of the team, bro!

47:24.620 --> 47:26.553
Yeah!

48:10.298 --> 48:11.832
Do you understand that
this has been going on all...

48:11.834 --> 48:14.001
Babe, babe.
What has happened?

48:14.003 --> 48:16.236
Don't do a thing.
Don't do that.

48:16.238 --> 48:19.506
Do you understand the trouble
you and your facility can be in?

48:19.508 --> 48:21.842
What kind of rules
do you guys set up here?

48:21.844 --> 48:23.710
You have a missing
child in New York City?

48:23.712 --> 48:24.814
- Babe, stop.
- Why?

48:28.517 --> 48:31.317
Get in the car!

48:31.319 --> 48:34.021
Also, do you think
the cost is gonna, you know,

48:34.023 --> 48:37.657
if we move him or how much it
costs, that's a big one.

48:37.659 --> 48:39.359
Well, I'm just saying
it's not getting through to him.

48:39.361 --> 48:41.561
Excuse me!

48:41.563 --> 48:42.899
You know how much trouble
you could have got into, Abe?

48:44.901 --> 48:46.967
- The kitchen, that chef...
- Mom!

48:46.969 --> 48:48.635
Listen to me.
I want you to listen to me.

48:48.637 --> 48:49.636
Respect me for a second.

48:49.638 --> 48:51.538
The kitchen, the chef,

48:51.540 --> 48:53.339
the guy who was helping you,

48:53.341 --> 48:55.275
they can get in serious trouble

48:55.277 --> 48:57.377
because they hired
an underage child!

48:57.379 --> 48:59.379
It's like training!
He's helping me!

48:59.381 --> 49:01.648
No! I was learning more
with Chico

49:01.650 --> 49:03.683
than I do in one week
in that stupid thing.

49:03.685 --> 49:06.386
Is that who that is? Chico?

49:06.388 --> 49:08.321
- Okay.
- Who is this guy?

49:08.323 --> 49:10.057
- Let's give Chico a call.
- Mom, stop!

49:10.059 --> 49:11.624
- Shh!
- Stop! He was helping me!

49:11.626 --> 49:13.060
Hello, Chico?

49:13.062 --> 49:15.562
Hi, this is Rebecca Solomon Ode,
Abe's Mom.

49:15.564 --> 49:18.431
You're embarrassing me, Mom!
Stop!

49:18.433 --> 49:19.869
- You disappointed me.
- You're so annoying!

49:22.972 --> 49:26.673
- I'm taking this.
- No. No, Dad!

49:26.675 --> 49:29.542
Laptop is done. You'll get this
back when school starts.

49:29.544 --> 49:30.445
You're grounded.

49:40.722 --> 49:43.423
He lied to us, but it's nothing.
It's mumbo-jumbo.

49:43.425 --> 49:46.559
I'm not going to live like this.
Look at me.

49:46.561 --> 49:48.461
- You wanna be the boss?
- Yes.

49:48.463 --> 49:51.598
You can go off in a corner
by yourself and be the boss.

49:51.600 --> 49:54.068
Go along your merry way, but
I'm not gonna live like that.

49:54.070 --> 49:56.036
You know what I'm saying?

51:10.780 --> 51:12.179
Happy New Year.

51:12.181 --> 51:13.850
Happy Jew Year, Hebes.

51:19.554 --> 51:23.489
Oh, '76, '77.

51:23.491 --> 51:25.125
Really nice stuff.

51:25.127 --> 51:27.694
It's grapey with a taste of...

51:27.696 --> 51:29.464
Is that Creation?

51:42.477 --> 51:43.545
Good.

51:49.751 --> 51:50.619
I do miss her.

52:05.201 --> 52:07.902
<i>I'm back in the game
after a compulsory detox.</i>

52:07.904 --> 52:10.940
<i>I recommend it,
but only if it's your choice.</i>

52:23.953 --> 52:27.254
I don't understand. Why?

52:27.256 --> 52:28.554
Is this because of me?

52:28.556 --> 52:30.623
- Hey, look at me.
- It is.

52:30.625 --> 52:32.226
No, it's not. Look at me.
Look at me.

52:32.228 --> 52:35.628
I promise you
it's not because of you.

52:35.630 --> 52:38.866
Sometimes, um, well,

52:38.868 --> 52:42.535
we think it's best
if we just take a little break.

52:42.537 --> 52:44.204
- A break?
- A break.

52:44.206 --> 52:46.106
- What do you mean, a break?
- Just a little time.

52:46.108 --> 52:47.207
A break from each other.

52:47.209 --> 52:49.045
Why do we need a break?

52:50.880 --> 52:52.880
We're a family.
We're together on this.

52:52.882 --> 52:54.949
Well, your father and I...

52:54.951 --> 52:56.917
It's not because of you, okay?

52:56.919 --> 52:58.052
- Hey, hey.
- No.

52:58.054 --> 52:59.954
Okay. all right.

52:59.956 --> 53:01.656
We love you.

53:05.962 --> 53:08.963
Think of it like this:
You get two Thanksgivings.

53:08.965 --> 53:11.298
One with me and teta,
and jido,

53:11.300 --> 53:14.703
and one with saba
and Ari and your mother.

55:31.907 --> 55:34.074
Cool! Everyone's got
assigned seats?

55:34.076 --> 55:36.376
- Yeah.
- Okay. That's cool.

55:36.378 --> 55:38.078
Are we due?

55:38.080 --> 55:39.813
- Yeah.
- It's a good idea, right?

55:39.815 --> 55:42.449
It's a great idea.
I love it, I love it.

55:42.451 --> 55:44.418
Everyone's gonna be
so happy, Abe.

55:44.420 --> 55:46.752
I think I see them.

55:46.754 --> 55:48.155
- Sounds like you're sarcastic.
- No, I'm not. I being...

55:48.157 --> 55:49.223
I'm... I'm really...

55:49.225 --> 55:52.725
Uh, this is really thoughtful.

55:52.727 --> 55:53.827
- I hear them.
- Here they are.

55:53.829 --> 55:55.331
- Hey!
- Hi, aba.

55:59.001 --> 56:00.903
Please close your eyes.

56:42.945 --> 56:44.411
Cool.

56:44.413 --> 56:45.381
Amen.

56:49.351 --> 56:51.852
- Okay.
- Cool.

56:51.854 --> 56:53.020
Please say Amen.

56:53.022 --> 56:54.154
- Amen.
- Amen.

56:54.156 --> 56:56.792
- Amen.
- Amen.

57:00.062 --> 57:03.197
Hummus and challah.
Sounds like a porno.

57:03.199 --> 57:07.134
Wait! It's a mix of things.
Keep it together.

57:08.837 --> 57:10.306
Mom...

57:12.241 --> 57:16.910
This falafel tastes
just like they do in Israel.

57:16.912 --> 57:19.313
Mm! They do.

57:19.315 --> 57:21.315
Wait, wait, don't get too full.
Purses are coming up.

57:21.317 --> 57:23.417
Purses?

57:23.419 --> 57:27.187
I wouldn't know what
the national snack of Israel

57:27.189 --> 57:29.323
tastes like in Israel,

57:29.325 --> 57:32.459
being that I'm not
permitted in Israel.

57:37.066 --> 57:40.000
Damn. Okay.
Sorry to bring it up.

57:40.002 --> 57:42.071
World War Falafel and shit.

57:43.539 --> 57:46.106
Okay, very hot.
Take one and pass it along.

57:46.108 --> 57:47.374
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Watch out, it's very hot.

57:47.376 --> 57:48.408
Okay, I got it.

57:48.410 --> 57:50.210
Straight out of the oven.

57:50.212 --> 57:53.480
Egyptians, Syrian, Yemeni.

57:53.482 --> 57:56.283
Jews came to Israel,

57:56.285 --> 57:59.886
and falafel was and is
a part of their culture.

57:59.888 --> 58:01.455
You don't own it.

58:01.457 --> 58:04.057
It's Middle Eastern, regional.

58:04.059 --> 58:07.060
My wife's family in Egypt

58:07.062 --> 58:10.497
was making falafel
for generations.

58:13.202 --> 58:14.901
- Mom.
- Hummus.

58:14.903 --> 58:18.405
Your list conveniently
never mentions the fact

58:18.407 --> 58:21.575
that our food is Palestinian.

58:21.577 --> 58:23.343
You came to our country,
Palestine.

58:23.345 --> 58:27.014
It was hardly a country.

58:27.016 --> 58:28.382
What do you mean?
Of course it was a country!

58:28.384 --> 58:30.384
Salad!

58:30.386 --> 58:32.419
- Salad!
- Yay!

58:32.421 --> 58:34.488
Calling falafel
the national food

58:34.490 --> 58:38.625
is another way of how Israel
appropriates our culture.

58:38.627 --> 58:41.895
Food, dance,
even our curse words,

58:41.897 --> 58:44.131
in order to contrive
its own culture

58:44.133 --> 58:46.266
and continue to erase ours.

58:46.268 --> 58:52.239
The families, terrorized by
a decade of brutal genocide,

58:52.241 --> 58:55.442
escaping unimaginable horror,

58:55.444 --> 58:59.946
my own parents
came intentionally

58:59.948 --> 59:02.316
to erase another people

59:02.318 --> 59:05.652
after suffering
their own erasure.

59:05.654 --> 59:09.623
Only a madman
would believe such a thing.

59:09.625 --> 59:11.558
- Ben...
- Can we please...

59:11.560 --> 59:13.327
The house was on fire, Benjamin,

59:13.329 --> 59:16.129
and those who jumped
to save themselves

59:16.131 --> 59:18.432
landed on the people
who were standing below.

59:18.434 --> 59:20.467
The crematorium was on fire.

59:20.469 --> 59:22.436
Hang on.
In this part of the story,

59:22.438 --> 59:25.639
I didn't hear about a fire.

59:25.641 --> 59:28.975
Can we please drop this?

59:28.977 --> 59:33.580
Can we please, for once,
be supportive of him?

59:33.582 --> 59:35.048
Smile a little bit, please.

59:35.050 --> 59:38.285
Here we go. Hey!
Look at that!

59:38.287 --> 59:39.152
- He made that!
- Oh!

59:39.154 --> 59:40.520
Great work, buddy!

59:40.522 --> 59:42.891
That's amazing, isn't it?

59:45.027 --> 59:47.127
That's my boy!
Hey, let me help you carve it.

59:47.129 --> 59:49.029
It's okay.

59:49.031 --> 59:52.332
Don't do that!
Bubbe, don't do that!

59:52.334 --> 59:55.369
Let me help you with this.
It's a little bit...

59:55.371 --> 59:57.604
Abe. Abe!
Abe, no, no, no!

59:57.606 --> 59:59.306
- Listen, listen.
- Dad, I got it.

59:59.308 --> 1:00:00.707
- Listen to me, listen to me.
- I can do it.

1:00:00.709 --> 1:00:03.377
It's not about that.

1:00:03.379 --> 1:00:04.611
It's still frozen.

1:00:04.613 --> 1:00:07.147
It's okay. It's okay.

1:00:07.149 --> 1:00:08.615
Something's coming
out of its booty.

1:00:08.617 --> 1:00:09.616
Oh. Fifteen more minutes.

1:00:09.618 --> 1:00:11.318
Okay, fifteen more.

1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:13.186
- Fifteen more minutes.
- Guys, guys.

1:00:13.188 --> 1:00:15.622
It's a little frozen.
Let it go, let it go.

1:00:15.624 --> 1:00:19.025
Mom!

1:00:19.027 --> 1:00:20.293
- I should help.
- Mom!

1:00:20.295 --> 1:00:21.728
Please sit down!

1:00:21.730 --> 1:00:23.263
Can you please sit down?

1:00:23.265 --> 1:00:26.032
- Aida.
- Thank you.

1:00:26.034 --> 1:00:29.002
It's important for him
that he do this alone.

1:00:29.004 --> 1:00:30.070
Do you understand?

1:00:30.072 --> 1:00:31.505
I think he could use a hand.

1:00:31.507 --> 1:00:33.073
If he needs a hand,
he can ask us.

1:00:33.075 --> 1:00:34.574
This is your parenting method?

1:00:34.576 --> 1:00:36.578
Leave him to do
whatever he wants?

1:00:38.247 --> 1:00:41.348
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

1:00:41.350 --> 1:00:44.551
No one is looking after him.
No one.

1:00:44.553 --> 1:00:47.120
We are looking after him.

1:00:47.122 --> 1:00:48.488
Oh, really?

1:00:48.490 --> 1:00:50.457
Yes, really.

1:00:50.459 --> 1:00:55.262
Where were you when he went
to work with a stranger, hmm?

1:00:55.264 --> 1:00:57.230
- Come on.
- Yeah!

1:00:57.232 --> 1:01:00.100
Or when he pretended
to be in the camp?

1:01:00.102 --> 1:01:01.401
- Were you right here?
- Now is not the time.

1:01:01.403 --> 1:01:03.370
Now is the time!

1:01:03.372 --> 1:01:06.440
I kept my mouth shut
long enough.

1:01:06.442 --> 1:01:08.208
When have you ever
kept your mouth shut?

1:01:08.210 --> 1:01:10.677
Mom, enough.

1:01:10.679 --> 1:01:12.379
What if something
had happened?

1:01:12.381 --> 1:01:14.147
Nothing happened to him.

1:01:14.149 --> 1:01:16.149
No one wants to say it, huh?

1:01:16.151 --> 1:01:19.019
What if he had gotten
kidnapped or worse?

1:01:19.021 --> 1:01:22.122
Mom, I'm asking you nicely
to please end this!

1:01:23.258 --> 1:01:28.161
Your... Your mother is right.

1:01:28.163 --> 1:01:30.599
Your child is lost.

1:01:33.602 --> 1:01:36.436
- He's not lost.
- Actually, Ben, you're right.

1:01:36.438 --> 1:01:38.338
He is lost.
You know why he's lost?

1:01:38.340 --> 1:01:43.310
Because you have manipulated him
with your religion

1:01:43.312 --> 1:01:46.179
and your God
and your bullshit, Mom!

1:01:46.181 --> 1:01:48.482
Sit down!
Sit down now!

1:01:48.484 --> 1:01:50.183
What did you expect, Rebecca?

1:01:50.185 --> 1:01:52.787
You married against
everyone's advice,

1:01:52.789 --> 1:01:55.455
knowing there would be
problems!

1:01:55.457 --> 1:01:59.125
We're gonna talk about that now,
15 years into it?

1:01:59.127 --> 1:02:01.761
Why are you saying this now?
How dare you!

1:02:01.763 --> 1:02:04.631
We feel sorry for him.
It is not fair!

1:02:04.633 --> 1:02:08.435
Not, not, not fair.
It was a mistake!

1:02:08.437 --> 1:02:13.607
Bringing a child
into your messy lives!

1:02:13.609 --> 1:02:16.176
He is saying
what needs to me said!

1:02:16.178 --> 1:02:18.478
- No, it is not the time!
- I'm sorry. I...

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.347
We should be ashamed!

1:02:20.349 --> 1:02:22.282
That's what you're gonna
talk about now,

1:02:22.284 --> 1:02:24.284
fifteen years after the fact.

1:02:24.286 --> 1:02:27.120
Mom, why don't you go over there
in the corner

1:02:27.122 --> 1:02:28.856
and sulk over there,
please, right now?

1:02:28.858 --> 1:02:30.590
- Selfish!
- Careful, Ben.

1:03:00.188 --> 1:03:01.755
Do you understand
or do you not care?

1:03:01.757 --> 1:03:02.689
I want you all
to leave my house.

1:03:02.691 --> 1:03:04.226
- Shit.
- What?

1:03:05.727 --> 1:03:07.095
What?

1:03:08.798 --> 1:03:09.797
What?

1:03:09.799 --> 1:03:10.732
He left it in the oven.

1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:14.167
Where is Abe?

1:03:14.169 --> 1:03:15.402
Abe!

1:03:15.404 --> 1:03:17.337
See? Are you happy now? Abe!

1:03:17.339 --> 1:03:18.672
Abraham!

1:03:18.674 --> 1:03:20.273
- Ibrahim.
- Abraham!

1:03:20.275 --> 1:03:22.309
He's probably upstairs.
Calm down, please.

1:03:22.311 --> 1:03:24.244
Abe!

1:03:24.246 --> 1:03:25.747
Come down here, buddy.
We're done arguing!

1:03:53.375 --> 1:03:54.775
- Avi!
- Abe!

1:03:54.777 --> 1:03:57.112
Ibrahim!

1:04:03.418 --> 1:04:05.320
Ibrahim!

1:04:12.327 --> 1:04:13.662
Ibrahim!

1:04:16.398 --> 1:04:17.699
Avi!

1:04:24.807 --> 1:04:26.375
Avi!

1:04:48.798 --> 1:04:51.765
Avi, it's Mama. Just...

1:04:51.767 --> 1:04:53.934
Now we're getting
a little worried.

1:04:53.936 --> 1:04:55.905
So why don't you pick up
the phone, bubbe, okay?

1:05:04.914 --> 1:05:06.914
Should we call the police?

1:05:06.916 --> 1:05:11.553
No. No! Oh, God.

1:05:19.294 --> 1:05:20.863
He couldn't have gone far.

1:05:22.731 --> 1:05:23.596
I'll drive around.

1:05:23.598 --> 1:05:24.867
I'll come with you.

1:05:42.584 --> 1:05:43.886
Is for you.

1:05:46.388 --> 1:05:47.890
Anything?

1:05:55.865 --> 1:05:58.899
I don't know what to do.

1:05:58.901 --> 1:06:01.470
It's okay.

1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:07.910
There is no guidebook
to be a parent.

1:06:10.847 --> 1:06:12.782
Hard to be one.

1:06:14.382 --> 1:06:15.918
And hard to lose one.

1:06:18.821 --> 1:06:20.957
He will come home, habibi.

1:06:29.698 --> 1:06:31.600
Thank you.

1:06:47.884 --> 1:06:49.484
I'm losing steam,
I can't see straight.

1:07:05.902 --> 1:07:08.871
You should eat something.

1:07:10.572 --> 1:07:11.941
I can't right now.

1:07:14.777 --> 1:07:16.411
Keep your strength up.

1:07:25.054 --> 1:07:26.388
Dad?

1:07:29.724 --> 1:07:31.558
Amir.

1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:32.761
Come.

1:07:39.534 --> 1:07:40.669
You eat.

1:07:52.447 --> 1:07:54.114
I'm sorry.

1:07:54.116 --> 1:07:59.021
No, I am sorry for my part
in all this.

1:08:00.890 --> 1:08:04.792
If I hurt you or him,

1:08:04.794 --> 1:08:07.660
I wish I could...

1:08:07.662 --> 1:08:09.866
take back everything I said.

1:08:13.535 --> 1:08:16.906
We all said things
that we shouldn't have, okay?

1:08:40.196 --> 1:08:41.563
Okay.

1:09:25.908 --> 1:09:27.475
We'll find him.

1:09:56.973 --> 1:09:58.174
Good.

1:10:00.076 --> 1:10:02.209
Very good.

1:10:02.211 --> 1:10:04.146
He's a good cook.

1:10:06.949 --> 1:10:09.116
Hey, have you guys seen this?

1:10:09.118 --> 1:10:10.918
What?

1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:14.154
Abe's on Instagram.
I didn't realize. Yeah.

1:10:14.156 --> 1:10:15.956
What is... What?

1:10:15.958 --> 1:10:18.025
It's the meal from tonight.

1:10:18.027 --> 1:10:20.294
What are you saying?
Is it the meal?

1:10:20.296 --> 1:10:22.096
What is Instagram?

1:10:22.098 --> 1:10:24.630
So, okay.

1:10:24.632 --> 1:10:27.234
It's a picture
from this meal tonight.

1:10:27.236 --> 1:10:28.268
He puts on the web.

1:10:28.270 --> 1:10:29.669
So you're saying he's...

1:10:29.671 --> 1:10:31.805
He's somewhere putting pictures.

1:10:31.807 --> 1:10:33.273
We'll be back. We'll be back.

1:10:33.275 --> 1:10:34.975
- Where are you going?
- We'll be back.

1:10:34.977 --> 1:10:37.111
That's my cell phone.

1:10:37.113 --> 1:10:38.180
Okay.

1:10:55.364 --> 1:10:57.199
Hey, brother.

1:10:58.633 --> 1:10:59.935
Hey. Sorry.

1:11:02.171 --> 1:11:03.772
Your folks are on the way.

1:11:06.708 --> 1:11:09.176
I tried to make it right.

1:11:09.178 --> 1:11:11.345
I tried to mix the foods and...

1:11:11.347 --> 1:11:14.083
and bring them together,
just like you showed me.

1:11:18.921 --> 1:11:21.188
But I messed it up.

1:11:21.190 --> 1:11:22.925
I just...
I messed everything up.

1:11:25.727 --> 1:11:28.896
They fought and fought
and fought and yelled,

1:11:28.898 --> 1:11:31.398
and they just yelled.

1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:35.869
I mean, I think I just
made everything worse.

1:11:35.871 --> 1:11:38.140
Look, Abe.

1:11:43.045 --> 1:11:46.413
You can't run away
from your problems.

1:11:46.415 --> 1:11:49.383
You need to face it.

1:11:49.385 --> 1:11:54.023
Sometimes people are not
going to come together.

1:11:55.391 --> 1:11:57.226
Just be yourself.

1:11:58.794 --> 1:11:59.328
Abe?

1:12:01.363 --> 1:12:02.298
Abe!

1:12:03.966 --> 1:12:05.968
It's all right.
It's all right.

1:12:08.703 --> 1:12:10.106
Hi.

1:12:14.877 --> 1:12:17.344
I'll give you some space, okay?

1:12:17.346 --> 1:12:18.347
Thank you.

1:12:24.453 --> 1:12:25.687
It's okay.

1:13:12.468 --> 1:13:14.268
<i>Maybe sometimes
life gets really ugly</i>

1:13:14.270 --> 1:13:15.905
<i>before it gets pretty.</i>

1:14:02.785 --> 1:14:05.419
<i>"Mix it Up" featuring
American-Brooklyn this summer.</i>

1:14:05.421 --> 1:14:08.822
<i>Yucca latkes, chocolate matzo,
and shwacos.</i>

1:14:08.824 --> 1:14:10.059
<i>You're all invited.</i>

1:14:26.108 --> 1:14:27.376
Would you like a taco?

1:14:46.962 --> 1:14:48.428
This is great.

1:14:48.430 --> 1:14:50.163
What's in here?

1:14:50.165 --> 1:14:52.032
Popsicles.

1:14:52.034 --> 1:14:53.934
Who is the chef?

1:14:53.936 --> 1:14:55.838
Chico. Yes, the tallest.

1:14:58.240 --> 1:14:59.206
What are these seeds in here?

1:14:59.208 --> 1:15:00.574
They're hemp seeds.

1:15:00.576 --> 1:15:04.044
There they are. Hey!

1:15:04.046 --> 1:15:05.512
Yay!

1:15:05.514 --> 1:15:09.149
Fruit punch and dragon fruit.

1:15:09.151 --> 1:15:10.917
It tastes really good.

1:15:10.919 --> 1:15:12.821
You look so cute in your apron.
Let me see.

1:15:16.592 --> 1:15:18.925
Hey, are these are hemp seeds
in here?

1:15:18.927 --> 1:15:19.993
Yep.

1:15:19.995 --> 1:15:21.928
I thought hemp, you wore hemp.

1:15:21.930 --> 1:15:24.031
I thought you smoked hemp.

1:15:24.033 --> 1:15:26.133
Did you know that
every ingredient you used

1:15:26.135 --> 1:15:27.901
is originally from...

1:15:27.903 --> 1:15:29.236
- Abe said not today.
- Not right now.

1:15:29.238 --> 1:15:30.871
- Is it kosher?
- Dad!

1:15:30.873 --> 1:15:33.373
I tried an edible popsicle
last year.

1:15:33.375 --> 1:15:35.642
I ate the whole thing at once.

1:15:35.644 --> 1:15:37.110
Totally blacked out!

1:15:37.112 --> 1:15:38.047
Oh, really?

1:15:40.349 --> 1:15:41.648
Thank you for everything,
friend.

1:15:41.650 --> 1:15:44.418
<i>My name is

1:15:44.420 --> 1:15:46.987
<i>Some people call me Abraham,</i>

1:15:46.989 --> 1:15:48.155
<i>some Avraim,</i>

1:15:48.157 --> 1:15:51.258

1:15:51.260 --> 1:15:54.328

1:15:54.330 --> 1:15:57.264

<i>Just Abe.</i>
