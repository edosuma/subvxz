03:10.440 --> 03:11.816
Captain, I found…

03:12.483 --> 03:14.652
I found E2. E2 is…

03:15.445 --> 03:16.404
E2 is dead.

03:17.030 --> 03:17.906
What?

03:19.657 --> 03:20.658
Say that again?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.204
There's a gunshot wound on his chest.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.457
<i>I think he was murdered.</i>

03:28.875 --> 03:30.251
<i>Where's Lieutenant Ryu?</i>

03:30.793 --> 03:32.003
<i>I haven't</i>

03:32.086 --> 03:33.755
found him yet.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.132
And the lunar water samples are gone.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.718
I understand.
Head over to the command center.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.595
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

Okay.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.650
Fuck. Why is everyone dying?

Lieutenant Ryu.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.394
Lieutenant Ryu.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.478
Turn around.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.910
Did you kill him?

06:50.993 --> 06:52.745
Why are you looking for Dr. Song?

06:53.788 --> 06:55.123
Why are you doing this?

06:57.959 --> 06:59.669
Aw, fuck!

07:01.504 --> 07:02.713
Why did you kill him?

07:07.552 --> 07:08.594
Answer me.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.310
Dr. Song went after that kid.

07:36.664 --> 07:39.375
<i>Kim Sun! Answer me, Kim Sun!</i>

07:41.836 --> 07:43.087
Let's split up.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.630
You continue with the search.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.841
I'll check on Kim Sun.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.050
Captain,

07:48.134 --> 07:51.429
the lunar water Dr. Song has is
the only sample we have at the moment.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.599
We should focus on retrieving
the sample and finding Dr. Song.

07:54.682 --> 07:58.519
If Dr. Song also lost the lunar water,
we must secure the ones in the main lab.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.857
The only one who could've killed E2
and taken the lunar water

08:03.941 --> 08:05.234
was Ryu Taesuk.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.363
Are you certain

08:10.948 --> 08:12.241
it was Lieutenant Ryu?

08:14.327 --> 08:17.747
Let's find out.
Be on standby once you find Dr. Song.

08:18.706 --> 08:19.624
Yes, sir.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.837
If the target shows any signs of danger,

08:24.921 --> 08:27.381
I will shoot her
in order to complete the mission.

08:29.717 --> 08:32.261
But I will make sure
Dr. Song comes back alive.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.747
You crazy bastard.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.457
You shouldn't be doing this.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.170
Damn it.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.142
I'm alive.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.520
I'm still alive.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.899
We need to stay alive.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.568
We can all go home alive.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.736
Let's go home alive.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.905
Let's just go home.

09:35.366 --> 09:38.911
Did Dr. Song find out something
about that monster?

09:39.829 --> 09:42.373
You're the monster here, you bastard.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.749
Fuck.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.877
What the heck is this anyway?

09:47.878 --> 09:49.171
Is this that valuable?

09:49.755 --> 09:53.009
Why would you take someone's life
over something like this, you asshole?

09:53.092 --> 09:55.136
Seriously! Fuck!

09:58.139 --> 09:59.515
Okay, stop it.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.352
Let's all go back home alive.

10:04.895 --> 10:05.855
Put that down.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.150
Put it down.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.359
Stop coming at me.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.738
Put it down, you motherfucker.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.323
You fucker!

10:15.406 --> 10:16.824
Stop right there!

10:17.366 --> 10:20.870
I'll pour this fucking thing all over you.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.581
I'll pour this and kill you, fuck!

10:40.389 --> 10:41.766
Please let me live.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.315
I got this… Damn it.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.656
Lieutenant Ryu, please let me live.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.324
Lieutenant Ryu…

10:58.824 --> 11:00.409
Help me.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.302
Hey, help me…

11:18.886 --> 11:20.012
Hey, man.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.266
I just want to go home.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.268
I just…

11:28.354 --> 11:29.605
Lieutenant Ryu…

11:42.410 --> 11:43.369
Lieutenant…

11:50.459 --> 11:52.044

11:52.128 --> 11:53.379

15:14.246 --> 15:15.164
Captain.

15:15.706 --> 15:16.957
I fell

15:18.751 --> 15:20.210
from the ventilation shaft.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.212
<i>Where are you?</i>

15:25.507 --> 15:26.508
I…

15:27.801 --> 15:29.678
I'm not sure where I am.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.139
It seems like a storage room.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.225

15:35.309 --> 15:37.686
<i>I will proceed with</i>
<i>the first test on a human body.</i>

15:48.155 --> 15:51.075
Luna 001 shows no sign of life.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.162
What have they done?

16:27.152 --> 16:29.488
<i>Luna 027, failed.</i>

16:30.739 --> 16:32.574
<i>Luna 037, failed.</i>

16:34.284 --> 16:36.286
<i>Luna 041, failed.</i>

16:38.330 --> 16:41.625
<i>Luna 054 shows no sign of life.</i>

17:17.453 --> 17:19.663
<i>Luna 073, all vital signs are stable.</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:22.541
<i>No multiplication of lunar water detected.</i>

17:23.792 --> 17:26.003
No adverse reaction in the body cells.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.561
Are you all right?

17:43.062 --> 17:43.896
Yes.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.919
<i>The sun rises and falls once every month.</i>

18:07.711 --> 18:10.339
<i>So it feels like I'm living</i>
<i>a really long day</i>

18:11.465 --> 18:13.550
<i>where time passes by slowly.</i>

18:15.302 --> 18:17.096
<i>It has been two years already,</i>

18:18.013 --> 18:20.891
<i>but I'm yet to find out</i>
<i>what exactly the lunar water is.</i>

18:21.934 --> 18:23.185
<i>The higher-ups</i>

18:23.977 --> 18:27.940
<i>are making a big fuss</i>
<i>and urging us to test it on human bodies.</i>

18:31.151 --> 18:32.152
Figures.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.696
If this succeeds,

18:35.614 --> 18:37.533
it could save humanity.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.495
Why?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.414
Why did you do that?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.989
It wasn't an easy decision.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.283
I know it was very cruel to you too.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.412
But I thought
it was something I had to do…

19:26.206 --> 19:28.917
for the sake of everyone's future.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.128
I wanted to…

19:33.839 --> 19:35.757
explain everything to you one day.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.512
Why did you call me here?

19:42.431 --> 19:43.974
What do you want me to do?

19:49.229 --> 19:50.314
Jian.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.530
I wanted to show you the sea.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.618
You're such a fool.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.246
Jian. What…

20:07.706 --> 20:09.333
What have I done?

20:09.833 --> 20:11.168
Why…

20:11.251 --> 20:14.338
Why didn't you just stay by my side?

20:18.175 --> 20:20.510
I'm sorry I didn't pick up your call.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.389

You've seen what she did

I was with her all along,
