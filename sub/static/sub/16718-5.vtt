WEBVTT

00:22.600 --> 00:25.280
THE ARTEMIS STONE

00:37.520 --> 00:38.680
You are not allowed to park that there.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.760
There are no parking
spaces for temporary workers.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.120
You say you're
temporary, but you've

00:42.240 --> 00:44.320
been here longer than
most of the military.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.600
A few months, right?

00:45.720 --> 00:46.680
Really, I'm working on it.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.160
Afraid to commit
and also want to die?

00:49.280 --> 00:50.240
Do you see that helmet?

00:50.480 --> 00:51.800
It's made of aramid
and carbon fibers,

00:51.960 --> 00:53.640
making it extremely
stable and heat-resistant.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.000
It can't stand a semi-trailer.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.240
Neither is a car.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.080
Why do you always mention
that you will leave at some point?

01:00.320 --> 01:02.360
You shouldn't get
too used to me, honey.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.520
Yes.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.240
It's not a good
idea in this place.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.480
It's been 2 weeks, but I still
think about Charlotte all the time.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.520
Something like that is
expected in war, but...

01:15.760 --> 01:18.320
But in a US city in 2016?

01:18.760 --> 01:20.000
Is there a difference?

01:22.720 --> 01:24.520
Gentlemen, the
ambulance is on the roof.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.600
Just five minutes.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.200
He's breathing alone,
that's good news.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.040
-The best news.
-I know.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.280
It will be a while
before he wakes up.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.360
There is nothing to worry about.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.640
There is always cause for concern.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.280
We watched Charlotte get shot.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.280
-Exactly here.
-That's not what this is about.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.400
You extubated
Mike and it worked.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.560
Clear?  You saw that
your brother was breathing.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.240
That's wonderful for him.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.320
You can be happy about it.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.560
Fine

01:51.880 --> 01:53.120
Please slow down.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.200
Sorry Dr.  Leighton.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.560
The child got away from me.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.640
Come over.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.440
Hey kids  Come.  Yes.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.160
My grandson Jagger needs
medical help right away.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.240
He is here.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.720
He is obviously on
the verge of dying.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.199
Mom, I said we don't
have to go to the hospital.

02:09.479 --> 02:10.800
The other parents
agreed with me.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.400
Since you panicked
her with a cold.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.840
And poison oak!

02:15.520 --> 02:17.080
Dr.  Kean, what do we have here?

02:17.480 --> 02:18.840
A group of campers.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.480
We were actually
doing "glamping".

02:21.240 --> 02:22.400
What is glamping?

02:22.520 --> 02:24.880
It stands for glamorous
camping with all the advantages

02:25.000 --> 02:26.440
of nature, without having
to sleep on the ground.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.400
Real camping is too
crazy for these kids.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.240
Mom, I told you I have
calamine lotion at home.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.520
Yes, she made them herself
from witch hazel and fruits.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.720
My mother would rather
pump her full of medicine.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.640
Well, let's get her in the
buffer room and out of the way.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.200
Folks, follow me.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.720
Come on, kids.  Right this way.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.320
Move.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.600
Two rescue team people come

02:50.800 --> 02:51.880
unknown injuries.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.320
Floods, earthquakes, landslides...

02:55.560 --> 02:56.960
... L.A.  is uninhabitable.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.040
That's how we stay in business.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.920
33-year-old who was
buried under rubble.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.000
Multiple crush injuries.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.520
The systolic blood pressure
fell to 92 along the way.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.520
33-year-old woman found
unconscious with her head in the mud.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.960
On three.  One two Three.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.320
Hypoxic and tachypnoic
on site, suction helped her.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.880
Now the saturation is around 90.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.160
Okay let's get started

03:13.560 --> 03:14.600
We have them.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.520
We cannot examine
them through the mud.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.960
Decontaminate, Dr.  Pineda.
We have something for that.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.600
Yes Mama.  Show him where it is.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.120
She should go to the
Center Stage immediately.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.360
Head is atraumatic.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.760
The pupils are of the
same size and reactive.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.160
Hip and pelvis stable,
but with defensive tension.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.560
Do I get an ultrasound?

03:34.720 --> 03:37.840
Faint rattling noises on both
sides with considerable stridor.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.800
That will be left over from
the mud stuck in your throat.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.200
I'm doing a cricothyroidotomy.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.440
Laryngoscope and
Magill forceps, please.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.200
Laryngoscope, please.

03:47.680 --> 03:48.640
Cricothyroidotomy is faster.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.600
She's more dangerous
too, Dr.  Campbell.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.280
I need to speak to Liz.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.840
She is being treated right now.
What's your name sir

03:55.960 --> 03:56.920
I have to see her.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.800
Dr.  Savetti, the
summary of injuries.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.120
The cervical
spine is insensitive.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.360
No deformities on
the chest or stomach.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.680
Chest murmurs are
good on both sides.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.600
Upper left extremity looks fine.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.000
Right...

04:07.400 --> 04:08.560
Crack in the ulnar artery.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.080
The mud must have
stopped the bleeding.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.560
Hold pressure.
Let's bring him in.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.519
Elliot!

04:17.720 --> 04:19.040
Keep them in the room.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.120
In the room.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.040
You mustn't take that.
Be quiet.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.040
Please use your energy indoors.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.000
How much longer will it take?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.640
We hurry up as best we can.
Trust me.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.520
Get started.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.760
I am Natalie Drake.
My son Jagger is eight.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.840
Let go of that.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.240
Would it have been
a real camp once!

04:36.360 --> 04:38.040
One where they learn
which plants to avoid.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.320
Mom, Jagger has a
mother and that's me.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.320
And I also have
parenting experience.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.480
Can you please stop?

04:43.640 --> 04:45.160
Look at this.
Now I have it too.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.000
Maybe it's not my
upbringing at all.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.080
That would be the first time.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.400
How are you?

04:53.400 --> 04:54.760
The distraction helps.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.600
Mommy, I'm not feeling well.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.400
This is not a playground.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.400
He seems to have a fever,
I give him an ibuprofen.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.000
Don't give him any medication

05:06.120 --> 05:07.640
until I've seen
his pediatrician.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.000
Natalie, this man is a doctor.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.560
Mom, I told you.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.360
Are you all right?

05:15.240 --> 05:16.640
Mom. Mom!

05:17.040 --> 05:18.280
I need the stretcher.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.000
Liz, are you okay?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.320
You need to calm down.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.440
Liz.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.080
Sir, you need to calm down.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.280
Liz.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.400
The heart sounds weak.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.600
I hear a rubbing noise.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.560
The neck veins are dilated.
Systolic blood pressure at 72.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.880
Take all blood
cross tests with him.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.040
Liz, are you okay?

05:40.440 --> 05:41.400
I'm about to.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.640
The spleen is injured.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.480
She needs a CT
scan when she's ready.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.760
Okay, wait a minute.  I have it.

05:47.960 --> 05:48.920
Done.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.520
Good.  Deep breaths.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.840
Malaya, please vacuum.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.240
ST segment is raised.
This is a heart attack!

05:57.160 --> 05:58.120
I want to see it.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.880
The ST elevations are diffuse.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.840
This is not a heart attack.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.240
This is pericarditis.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.480
That explains the rubbing noises.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.120
What kind of rash is that?

06:08.240 --> 06:09.360
The cause is poison oak.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.280
Tongue depressor.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.680
It comes from the poison oak.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.560
Dr.  Dixon...

06:15.080 --> 06:16.360
Have a look here.

06:17.840 --> 06:18.800
Tell me what you see

06:20.480 --> 06:21.440
Head stains.

06:21.920 --> 06:22.880
Measles.

06:23.840 --> 06:24.800
Correctly.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.560
You have just exposed our
most critical patients to this.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.880
Leighton, put her in quarantine.

06:29.000 --> 06:29.960
Go Go.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.360
Liz.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.000
Liz, luckily you are fine.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.440
You son of a bitch!

06:42.880 --> 06:43.840
What?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.320
You killed Drew!

06:45.840 --> 06:47.000
Take it easy.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.240
He killed my friend!

07:03.600 --> 07:05.160
I put the drunks in the buffer

07:05.320 --> 07:06.840
room, but it's overcrowded now.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.320
We'll just have to stack
them in the corridor.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.400
We expect more injuries
from this landslide.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.240
We need all the
space we can get.

07:13.880 --> 07:14.840
Sorry.

07:14.960 --> 07:15.920
Forgiveness.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.760
Hey, help me out.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.200
Dr.  Pineda, get the chair.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.040
Her blood pressure drops
rapidly, her pulse accelerates.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.640
Your heart hardly beats.

07:28.760 --> 07:29.840
The pericardium
is full of fluid.

07:29.960 --> 07:30.920
Do you have the lidocaine ready?

07:31.040 --> 07:32.400
She has a large
pericardial effusion.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.040
We do a pericardiocentesis.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.440
I take care of it.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.200
Dr.  Dixon, let's remove
the fluid from the heart.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.520
Spinal needle.

07:43.960 --> 07:44.920
So fine.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.640
There you are.

07:46.760 --> 07:47.720
Keep that calm.

07:48.680 --> 07:49.640
And we're in.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.040
Get the pressure transducer.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.440
Slowly.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.080
There you are.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.680
You're doing great.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.480
Welcome back, Joanna.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.480
The blood pressure rises again.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.280
Thank you Dr.  Leighton.
You are excused.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.680
Dr.  Dixon will take
care of it from now on.

08:18.800 --> 08:19.760
Stethoscope?

08:26.920 --> 08:28.120
I wanted an urgent CT.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.200
You and everyone else too.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.720
Because of the landslide,
half of Malibu is here.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.800
Come on.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.280
Liz?

08:35.559 --> 08:36.760
Liz, hey.

08:36.880 --> 08:37.840
You have to believe me.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.320
We were on the slope and
the ground was sliding away.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.280
I wanted to hold you both tight.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.520
Can we get out of here?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.760
I saved who I could save!

08:45.880 --> 08:47.200
Easy, brother.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.560
Why should I let go of him?

08:48.680 --> 08:50.240
-Go Go.
-That's crazy.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.080
-That's crazy.
-We have to move on now.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.720
Drew was my best friend!

08:53.840 --> 08:54.800
- So nice.
-Liar!

08:54.920 --> 08:56.040
-No!
-Liar!

08:56.160 --> 08:57.280
Drew was my best friend!

09:05.200 --> 09:06.160
I didn't kill Drew.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.480
Nobody thinks that either.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.240
-Colonel Willis, his values.
-Thank you.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.800
You heard Liz, didn't you?

09:11.280 --> 09:12.480
I held them both tight.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.840
And the mud...
It tore them both away.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.080
I couldn't save both of them.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.040
She thinks I let him die.
Why is she thinking that?

09:21.920 --> 09:23.000
Did you let him die?

09:24.120 --> 09:25.080
No.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.640
She called you Colonel,

09:26.760 --> 09:27.720
are you from the military?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.480
Afghanistan.  Three missions.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.320
National Guard.  Since I was 20.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.040
Your creatine levels
are extremely high,

09:34.280 --> 09:36.120
that is, your muscles
break down quickly.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.720
So you understand.
You lost people too.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.400
Or?

09:42.080 --> 09:44.840
The free proteins can
lead to kidney failure.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.800
This is called rhabdomyolysis,
or rhabdo for short.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.040
My kidneys?

09:49.160 --> 09:50.840
Strong hydrogenation
should solve the problem.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.440
Give him saline, 30 ml per

09:53.560 --> 09:55.360
kilogram, then 250 ml per hour.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.960
You understand what I'm saying?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.920
You saw friends dying
that you wanted to save.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.280
Or?

10:09.280 --> 10:10.960
I wanted to save him, man.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.920
For real.  I tried.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.000
Chill out.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.680
Hey, Liz.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.080
We'll keep you here
overnight and watch you.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.800
Every two hours someone becomes

10:28.360 --> 10:31.600
Examine your stomach
and look after you.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.120
That hurts?

10:36.840 --> 10:38.400
I'm crazy right?

10:38.720 --> 10:39.880
You had a tough day.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.200
We see something like this
every day as rescue workers.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.280
We come when a
situation is really tough.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.960
I can understand that.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.280
I'm crazy.

10:53.960 --> 10:54.920
It is only...

10:55.880 --> 10:57.120
I know rick.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.280
I know how he feels about me.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.520
He wanted to keep it a secret.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.880
Drew and I wanted to get married.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.880
I even wanted to
take his sick name.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.880
McAdoo.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.280
Drew McAdoo?

11:15.640 --> 11:17.000
Silly, isn't it?

11:18.520 --> 11:19.720
But i love him...

11:21.040 --> 11:22.000
... loved him.

11:24.920 --> 11:25.880
Oh God.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.000
I saw how it was washed away.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.720
In one second he was there

11:33.680 --> 11:35.600
in the next...

11:37.280 --> 11:38.240
Liz.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.400
Listen to.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.160
I don't know you
and I don't know Rick.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.800
But I know because I've
seen many people in need

11:49.400 --> 11:52.160
that sometimes we just
want to blame someone

11:54.240 --> 11:55.440
We want to be mad at someone.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.360
Because otherwise there would be

11:59.080 --> 12:00.400
only the loss.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.960
I wanted to pick up my customer.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.880
I don't know why that guy
suddenly stopped in front of me.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.200
I hit my head on the airbag.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.520
Are you a taxi driver?

12:24.640 --> 12:26.480
Yes, for 36 years.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.480
I live the dream.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.840
That sounds like a great job.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.040
It was him.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.840
Until some teen
almost ruined me.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.320
A process?

12:35.040 --> 12:36.000
Over.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.240
You said you didn't see
the driver in front of you?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.280
No, I didn't see him.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.600
Or I saw him too late.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.080
Yes.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.520
When I saw it, it
was a little blurry.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.200
Okay, fine.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.720
I'll have a head CT
done to examine my nose

12:55.880 --> 12:57.640
and to rule out a brain injury.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.760
And an ophthalmologist
will take a look at your eyes.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.080
Thanks Doc.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.720
Why don't you just
write the instruction.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.600
I'll check on Jesse and
make sure it goes ahead.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.280
Get this off my neck.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.560
There he is, Dr.  Junior.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.400
Fifty year old who
fell from the first floor.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.600
Consciousness changes, it
babbles, but reacts to pain.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.880
Smells like ethanol.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.040
Of course he does.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.600
Superficial wounds
on the extremities.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.400
We take over.  Let's
bring it to the side area.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.840
It's been a long time.
Did you miss me?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.840
You have to leave
the collar alone.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.160
He's so tight.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.360
You have to loosen up.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.280
I didn't raise you
to be a grouch.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.440
Do you know the guy?

13:56.160 --> 13:57.800
No.  He is my father.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.600
Dr.  Savetti,

14:05.880 --> 14:07.640
should another doctor
treat him this time?

14:08.080 --> 14:09.480
The rules about family
member treatment?

14:09.720 --> 14:10.880
Don't worry, honey.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.560
He doesn't count me as part of the family.

14:15.520 --> 14:16.480
Damn it.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.440
How about some painkillers, doc?

14:20.560 --> 14:21.520
A milligram of Dilaudid?

14:22.200 --> 14:23.400
I like the girl.

14:23.960 --> 14:24.920
Do you have plans later?

14:25.520 --> 14:27.400
Her name is Dr.
Kean.  Now shut up.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.080
The alcohol has already
numbed him enough.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.080
You sound like your mother.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.880
Funny that you remember her.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.440
How could i forget her

14:39.360 --> 14:41.120
How did you get hurt, Vince?

14:41.720 --> 14:43.200
That is a long story.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.280
It's always the same.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.920
Either he falls or he is beaten.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.000
What was it this time, dad?

14:47.200 --> 14:50.040
I forgot to pay my
bill at the liquor store.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.760
So I ran out and fell...

14:51.880 --> 14:53.560
-Yes.
-... down a hill.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.360
The bottles stopped my case.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.800
All because of a
stolen six-pack?  Great.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.520
How old am I?  12?

15:00.800 --> 15:03.720
No, it was Kentucky bourbon.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.440
The good.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.320
I wouldn't be in
this position if you

15:08.440 --> 15:10.840
had given me the
money I asked for.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.000
Sure, hold me responsible.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.160
Which makes you feel better.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.200
I could use the bourbon.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.000
I could really use the bourbon.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.240
Mario, look.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.760
He's got a 5 to 6
cm wound back here.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.200
It must have covered his hat.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.360
Tell radiology we
need a CT right away.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.800
He could be bleeding into the brain.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.080
Take your hands off me!

15:37.160 --> 15:38.120
You...

15:38.280 --> 15:39.640
can touch me as
many times as you want

15:42.680 --> 15:46.200
They say my mom has
measles is it my fault?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.800
This is called herd immunity.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.320
When everyone is vaccinated,

15:49.480 --> 15:52.800
people like your
mother are protected.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.800
But when some people
don't get vaccinated...

15:54.920 --> 15:57.120
If you're in the immune herd,
why are you wearing the gown?

15:57.240 --> 15:58.400
So that we don't
spread the pathogen.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.480
But she had a vaccination.
I do not understand that.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.440
Vaccinations get
weaker over time.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.040
That's why your
mother was at risk.

16:10.920 --> 16:11.880
Hey doc

16:12.520 --> 16:13.480
Now...

16:14.520 --> 16:15.920
That's it for my
modeling career.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.280
I wouldn't throw
in the towel yet.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.400
The CT shows a broken
nose, but it is not displaced.

16:22.600 --> 16:23.600
So it will heal.

16:24.880 --> 16:25.840
Hey doc

16:27.240 --> 16:29.240
I always notice what
my customers have

16:29.360 --> 16:30.480
for a day as soon as
they get into my taxi.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.520
-For real?
-Yes.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.920
When I look into her
eyes in the rearview mirror

16:36.320 --> 16:37.280
tell me a story.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.280
It is a beautiful gift.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.880
Do you want to know what I
see when I look into your eyes?

16:48.320 --> 16:49.680
You're not having
a very nice day.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.360
And...

16:52.120 --> 16:53.920
I suppose that's because

16:55.000 --> 16:57.120
that you will say that I
won't have the gift long.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.560
Did you know?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.240
Yes.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.680
I thought...

17:05.480 --> 17:07.240
If I ignore the diagnosis

17:09.319 --> 17:10.839
I could pretend she wasn't real

17:14.520 --> 17:15.480
Now...

17:19.119 --> 17:21.040
It looks like macular
degeneration.

17:24.359 --> 17:25.319
Oscar...

17:26.680 --> 17:29.240
Loss of eyesight is a bad thing.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.880
It's okay if you're
scared of it.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.800
I'm not afraid of going blind.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.600
I am afraid that my license
will be taken away from me.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.280
You could do other jobs, right?

17:48.960 --> 17:51.480
It may be difficult for
a doctor to understand

17:55.360 --> 17:57.560
but driving means
everything to me.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.440
I don't have a wife

18:03.080 --> 18:04.480
I have no kids.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.320
But I have my customers.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.520
They meet...

18:12.960 --> 18:14.480
They fill my life.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.360
I get it, Oscar.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.320
For real.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.400
It's OK.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.200
Did you never hear about the
cockroach theory in college?

18:34.360 --> 18:36.560
I must have missed the
lecture, explain to me.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.840
The hospital is full of
good people, sick and dying.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.600
And then there are those
here who don't value life.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.440
Drinkers, criminals,
sociopaths, and so on.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.200
Somehow they always
leave the clinic unscathed.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.520
Your dad is a cockroach?

18:57.920 --> 18:59.440
You are a bit overly sensitive.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.840
Do you have stomach pain?

19:02.560 --> 19:03.520
Liz?

19:04.080 --> 19:05.360
-Liz?
-What happened?

19:05.520 --> 19:07.720
I don't know, she talked,
then she didn't react anymore!

19:07.880 --> 19:09.160
I must have enlarged the injury.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.840
-Ultrasound, please.
-Blood pressure is at 43 to 20.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.240
Are you all right?

19:14.360 --> 19:15.320
I have to see Liz.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.520
I will see.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.720
I can't lose her, man.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.480
Your spleen has ruptured.

19:24.720 --> 19:25.680
Should I inform the OP?

19:25.840 --> 19:27.440
Yes, tell Campbell
to come over urgently.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.960
She is bleeding to death inside.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.360
We have to remove
the spleen immediately.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.960
-Center Stage?
-Yes, to the Center Stage.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.040
Right now guys!

19:33.160 --> 19:34.120
Campbell will be there in five minutes.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.000
Then we are already
elbow deep in her stomach.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.600
Intubator is in, I
see a color change.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.280
The first session is running.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.000
Good.  Peritoneum is open.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.960
I need better vision.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.120
Please tighten
the abdominal wall.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.600
Belly cut template.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.160
Do you remove a spleen
in the emergency room?

19:54.040 --> 19:56.560
We wouldn't think it would be
great if she died in the elevator.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.760
No, you wanted to
play cowboy down here.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Let's save their lives
first and then argue later.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.120
Let me take it.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.120
I have my finger
on the spleen port.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.440
Brackets please.

20:08.560 --> 20:09.520
Got it.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.640
Good, please to the right.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.240
Okay, the bleeding has stopped.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.680
The blood pressure rises again.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.480
Then my work is done here.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.640
Hey, don't go so fast.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.800
I have dinner here.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.840
I want to share my crackers.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.680
I don't like crackers.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.320
What do you like?
I will order it.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.920
Garçon, may I have the card?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.120
Sorry

20:44.880 --> 20:46.280
Why are you making
it so difficult for her?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.240
I want to get her
to go out with her.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.120
What?  Too subtle?

20:51.080 --> 20:52.280
The CT results are there.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.520
Yes?

20:54.120 --> 20:55.080
How's my head

20:56.120 --> 20:57.080
Nothing to see.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.240
Like a cat baby

20:59.560 --> 21:00.640
Ten lives.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.720
-Nine.
-What ever.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.240
Is there anything else?

21:15.600 --> 21:16.680
You're unbelievable.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.240
Here.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.560
-Take that.
-What is it?

21:21.040 --> 21:22.000
What do you think?

21:22.120 --> 21:23.640
I thought you won't give
me any more money.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.280
I've changed my mind.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.200
What's the catch?

21:27.600 --> 21:29.400
Just take it.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.720
Yeah, have fun with it.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.120
Why in such a hurry?

21:40.440 --> 21:41.400
Let's go eat out.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.360
I have money now.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.720
You wanted the
money, now you have it.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.560
It's supposed to be spent on
something good, but I know better.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.040
Either way dad

21:54.200 --> 21:55.320
it is enough for me.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.960
I asked a sister
for answers an hour

22:06.080 --> 22:07.520
ago, she said she
would give me some.

22:07.640 --> 22:08.840
Nobody said anything.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.280
Your mother is stable.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.240
We'll do another
echocardiogram in an hour.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.520
But are you fine?

22:14.120 --> 22:15.880
We'll know more in an hour.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.520
I... I don't know how
this could happen yet.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.280
I just didn't want to
poison my children.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.000
And me...

22:23.520 --> 22:25.320
I've read so much.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.440
-In chat rooms...
-Chat rooms?

22:28.040 --> 22:29.000
Are you kidding?

22:29.680 --> 22:31.520
Not a study brings

22:31.640 --> 22:34.000
Vaccinations linked to the

22:34.120 --> 22:35.640
nightmare fantasies
you think are real.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.920
But the diseases they
prevent are dangerous.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.240
So dangerous that your
mother is fighting for her life!

22:42.480 --> 22:43.920
Dr.  Dixon, that's enough.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.240
Take a lap, please.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.760
Dr.  Leighton, get out.  Now.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.120
-I?
-Right away.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.920
You are in your second year of practice.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.360
Why are you mad at me?
I did not say anything.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.560
But you stood by in silence
when a freshman said something.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.080
Why should I be to blame?

23:06.000 --> 23:09.920
Those in the second year of training should
help those in the first year of training.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.760
To teach them is
to teach yourself.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.400
Fine, but if I may
put it that way, I

23:14.520 --> 23:16.440
consider her an
irresponsible mother.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.000
I don't think he's wrong.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.840
Of course, medically
speaking, he's not wrong.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.800
But she doesn't need
a lecture right now.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.720
Her son is sick, her
mother is even sicker.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.040
Right now she
needs our sympathy.

23:31.560 --> 23:35.720
I want to tell you
something about parenting.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.360
It's a minefield.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.000
But you don't walk around in it.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.080
It's your child.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.960
They just stand
on the edge and tell

23:42.120 --> 23:44.480
where to step
without being harmed.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.240
And often you can only guess.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.120
You should understand
this better than anyone else.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.560
Angus, you are in a
minefield yourself right now.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.880
So your thoughts are
with Mike, not here.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.040
And i can understand that

24:00.600 --> 24:02.880
but that has to stop immediately.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.480
Understood?

24:15.680 --> 24:17.280
I have this for
you, Dr.  Guthrie.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.080
Against your low
blood sugar levels.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.680
Is Oscar Terzian your patient?

24:23.960 --> 24:25.440
Yes of course.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.960
And are your patients
important to you?

24:28.320 --> 24:29.280
What is?  Is he alright?

24:29.400 --> 24:30.920
No, he's not fine.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.720
I had to tell the
man he was going

24:33.840 --> 24:35.080
blind and you were
nowhere to be found.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.320
I'm sorry, my patient
of the landslide...

24:37.480 --> 24:39.320
Oscar Terzian is
your patient too.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.720
You need to learn how to
manage your time, Dr.  Pineda.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.960
So the kidneys recover.

25:05.320 --> 25:06.520
Liz is still in the operating room.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.880
She is fine.  I thought
you'd like to know.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.320
I would like to remember
how it happened.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.560
That again?

25:12.680 --> 25:15.160
One second I'm holding
it, the next it's gone.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.200
It's... it was just hard.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.960
- His watch...
- Let's talk about your dialysis.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.800
Isn't there a
confidentiality clause?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.600
That's what lawyers say.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.240
I lied.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.200
I love her.

25:27.480 --> 25:30.160
-I think about her...
-Stop talking.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.320
And call the lawyer.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.960
I don't need a lawyer!
I didn't kill him!

25:33.080 --> 25:34.040
He was my best friend.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.520
What if I did it subconsciously?

25:37.680 --> 25:39.760
What if this conversation
was subconscious?

25:40.520 --> 25:41.480
Colonel.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.640
I am not a murderer.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.160
OK.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.640
You should stop
when it's at its best.

26:01.920 --> 26:02.880
What happened?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.160
I tried to draw blood
and she passed out.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.240
Does she have a pulse?

26:06.520 --> 26:07.480
Yes, but only weakly.

26:07.720 --> 26:08.880
The blood pressure drops rapidly.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.120
I do not understand that.

26:12.880 --> 26:13.920
What's going on here?

26:14.120 --> 26:15.400
What are you going to do, Dr.  Dixon?

26:17.560 --> 26:18.520
Doctor...

26:19.920 --> 26:21.120
How long has she
had this rhythm?

26:22.120 --> 26:23.440
I have no idea, I've only
been here a moment.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.480
Risa, increase oxygen supply.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.800
Do you see the P waves?

26:29.200 --> 26:31.760
It is totally independent of
the ventricular contractions.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.360
This is a third
degree heart block.

26:34.840 --> 26:35.800
Measles.

26:36.080 --> 26:38.000
The virus must have
damaged her heart muscles.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.440
- Heart muscle inflammation?
-Bingo.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.640
We need to set an
emergency pacemaker.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.120
Risa, call the supply.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.600
He has ventricular fibrillation.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.040
He was shocked twice.
He goes into cardiac arrest.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.640
He had five units of epi.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.400
Another epic.

27:05.920 --> 27:06.880
This is Vince.

27:18.920 --> 27:19.880
Hey

27:20.520 --> 27:22.240
Why do everyone
always want to talk to me?

27:22.360 --> 27:23.320
I am not made for it.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.360
-But you could be.
-But I don't want to be.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.800
I want to be the one
who goes to work, comes

27:26.920 --> 27:28.560
home and doesn't find
out anything personal

27:28.680 --> 27:29.640
and not from anyone.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.520
I think you are
complaining too loud.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.920
I saw you with Rick.
You don't care.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.240
Another patient from the landslide!

27:40.200 --> 27:41.480
What's your name sir

27:42.360 --> 27:43.320
Drew.

27:43.480 --> 27:44.560
Drew McAdoo.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.320
Are you Drew McAdoo?

27:46.560 --> 27:47.880
Straight to the Center Stage, please.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.800
-He lives.
-Seems so.

27:58.640 --> 27:59.920
He is bleeding from the
wound starting from the branch.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.400
I'm doing an abdominal ultrasound.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.760
Attach two units.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.200
What you wanna do?

28:14.280 --> 28:15.240
What you wanna do?

28:22.440 --> 28:23.920
He's been dead for 40 minutes.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.040
Mario.

28:31.680 --> 28:32.640
I want to declare him dead.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.000
-I could...
-It's over.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.440
Declare him dead.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.400
Time of death...

28:49.680 --> 28:50.840
is 6:32 p.m.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.840
Good job dr.  Kean.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.080
You did your best.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.080
I do that.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.120
Prepare a bandage trolley.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.200
Hold the pressure.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.680
That was Mario's father.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.560
Hold on, okay?

29:29.920 --> 29:30.880
It hurts.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.880
We're going to pull the
branch out to stop the bleeding.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.480
I Agree.
I prefer to lock you up.

29:34.600 --> 29:35.560
Understood.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.120
I need an artery
clamp and suture.

29:37.680 --> 29:38.640
I suck.

29:38.760 --> 29:42.640
On three.  One two Three.

29:44.440 --> 29:45.400
Come on.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.520
Take this to pathology.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.520
He went through the soft tissue

29:54.760 --> 29:56.280
not through the stomach.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.760
He's a lucky guy.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.160
Let's do a CT.  Fast.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.320
There are a lot of
people waiting to see you.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.520
How far are you in?

30:12.720 --> 30:14.400
A little more over 20 cm.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.080
Good.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.320
Now inflate the balloon.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.960
I really think you
should do that.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.280
This is your patient, Dr.  Dixon.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.560
This is how we learn
emergency medicine.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.720
During emergencies.

30:29.960 --> 30:30.920
I agree.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.560
Now put the plug
in the generator.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.320
So?

30:39.840 --> 30:41.000
Perfect.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.120
Look at the screen.

30:49.800 --> 30:50.840
It's taken over.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.040
She has a pulse.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.640
That was a good job, Doctor.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.080
I did that with
Dr.  Got Guthrie.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.240
He was right, I wasn't
where I should have been.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.840
And the hand tremor?

31:11.600 --> 31:12.760
Which hand tremor?

31:14.360 --> 31:15.840
Do you think your mama is blind?

31:16.840 --> 31:18.480
No, I just don't know
what you're talking about.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.840
Don't ask him about it.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.800
He should therefore come to you.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.240
And what if not?

31:29.360 --> 31:31.400
He will when he's ready.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.200
Hey

31:40.560 --> 31:41.920
See what i found.

31:44.760 --> 31:45.720
Drew?

31:46.680 --> 31:47.640
Drew.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.720
He slipped two miles to see you.

31:50.000 --> 31:50.960
Hey

31:51.160 --> 31:53.080
But that's great
room service here.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.760
I saw you being washed away

31:55.520 --> 31:56.680
I thought you were...

31:56.880 --> 31:57.840
I am fine.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.040
I'm good.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.080
I'm okay

32:02.440 --> 32:03.600
Thanks, rick.

32:04.720 --> 32:05.680
You saved her.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.200
She'll get well again.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.720
-You saved Liz.
-Yes, but I let go of you.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.560
I let you go

32:13.600 --> 32:14.720
That's what you think?

32:16.040 --> 32:17.160
That you let go of me

32:18.040 --> 32:19.000
No, man.

32:20.760 --> 32:21.960
I let go of you

32:23.600 --> 32:25.000
I pulled my hand away

32:25.120 --> 32:26.280
so you can save Liz.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.720
She means everything to me.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.360
-I know.
-Thank you.

32:41.640 --> 32:43.360
How hard is it to put
the coffee away after...

32:46.440 --> 32:48.840
I have to do everything
myself, also good.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.360
Are you doing well?

32:50.720 --> 32:52.400
I just want a cup of coffee.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.720
I have a secret stash of Kenya

32:55.840 --> 32:56.800
pearl beans in my
locker if you want?

32:57.480 --> 32:58.440
That’s okay.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.000
I want to make my own.

33:02.240 --> 33:05.160
I'm very sorry about your dad.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.480
Thank you.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.440
Hey, this is not your fault.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.960
I know.  Believe me.

33:12.440 --> 33:13.800
He's been killing
himself for years.

33:25.040 --> 33:28.240
She is still exhausted from
the anesthetic, but is fine.

33:29.920 --> 33:33.600
There are strict rules for
living with a pacemaker.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.480
No metal detectors,
no microwaves...

33:36.640 --> 33:38.640
I know I've researched online.

33:42.000 --> 33:42.960
Just a joke.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.160
By the way, I called
a new pediatrician

33:48.360 --> 33:50.240
and my kids will be
vaccinated next week.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.360
Nice to hear that.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.560
Natalie...

33:55.040 --> 33:56.000
Sweetheart...

33:56.520 --> 33:57.480
Mom...

33:57.960 --> 33:59.640
-Sweetheart.
-Mom.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.080
Hi.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.880
Mom, I'm so sorry.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.200
-Oh dear.
-It's my fault.

34:06.920 --> 34:07.880
I love you.

34:08.639 --> 34:09.960
Even after what I did?

34:11.040 --> 34:14.679
I am your mother.  I love you
in spite of all your mistakes.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.480
I also you.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.800
You did a good job there.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.080
You also.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.480
Do we want to clap,
or hug, or something?

34:24.600 --> 34:25.560
No.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.239
What about your shaky hands?

34:44.960 --> 34:46.120
I beg your pardon?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.800
If you want to tell
us something then...

34:49.040 --> 34:50.000
I do not want to.

34:51.239 --> 34:53.280
Unless you know a good
alternative to caffeine.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.360
You mean low blood sugar, right?

35:00.240 --> 35:01.680
Maybe a bit of both.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.000
What happened
to waiting for him?

35:06.240 --> 35:07.640
It was taking too long.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.480
Dr.  Campbell,

35:21.520 --> 35:22.680
I want to apologize.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.640
It's been difficult months for
me and I wanted to tell you...

35:27.080 --> 35:28.800
I wanted to tell you
something about Mike.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.280
You can see increased
activity on his latest EEG.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.280
That could be an interfering signal.

35:38.880 --> 35:41.840
Or a very good sign.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.560
Liz...

36:16.280 --> 36:17.240
Liz...

36:18.640 --> 36:19.600
I'm here.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.360
I'm there.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.600
I better forget
what you told me?

37:00.680 --> 37:02.760
You come here just to
die in front of my eyes

37:05.400 --> 37:06.800
You could have disappeared.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.640
I would never have known.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.280
Did you come here on purpose

37:25.600 --> 37:26.560
Did you know

37:33.280 --> 37:34.480
You were here...

37:38.320 --> 37:39.480
You were finally here...

37:42.560 --> 37:44.560
Hey i'm fine

37:49.200 --> 37:51.120
I said i'm fine.  Jeez

37:55.200 --> 37:56.160
Come here.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.880
Look, I'm fine, okay?

38:00.000 --> 38:00.960
Come here.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.520
-I'm serious.
-Come here.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.000
I'm fine.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.360
I know.

38:08.840 --> 38:09.800
I know.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.440
I'm fine.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.360
I'm really sorry.

38:15.520 --> 38:16.520
I'm fine.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.240
I'm fine.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.440
I'm fine.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.800
I'm fine.

38:23.760 --> 38:24.720
I'm fine.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.880
You are still here.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.080
I'm starting to feel like
you want to get rid of me.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.400
Yes.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.480
I recognize your bluff.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.800
I thought you might want a beer.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.560
Thank you.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.440
I want to go back, but that
doesn't mean they'll take me.

38:53.480 --> 38:56.120
What did you do there that you
were punished with this place?

38:58.080 --> 38:59.040
This place

38:59.240 --> 39:01.120
is considered the best
emergency room in the world.

39:01.680 --> 39:02.880
It is an honor to be here.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.320
Do you know why I am called mom?

39:06.560 --> 39:07.920
Because I'm careful.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.840
I take care of my family.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.120
And now you are one of them.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.800
Like it or not.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.240
In Afghanistan...

39:24.560 --> 39:28.040
"The war evokes everything
that is sublime and honest

39:29.000 --> 39:30.040
is on a person.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.720
He unites him with his brothers

39:34.960 --> 39:37.160
and connects them
through selfless love. "

39:40.720 --> 39:41.680
That is beautiful.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.320
It's not mine.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.320
It comes from a novel about
Sparta by Steven Pressfield.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.400
But I like it.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.400
I left many good men
and women behind.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.720
I just want to go back to them.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.040
We have brothers
and sisters here too

40:01.440 --> 40:03.320
and a lot of selfless love.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.120
We don't lose a soldier
in the field every day.

40:09.960 --> 40:10.920
But recently.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.680
We could use one to
help us get through it.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.240
I knew it.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.520
-You are attached to me.
-No.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.280
I did not say that.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.360
Fine  Maybe I'll
stay a while longer.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.160
Just to piss off Campbell.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.440
Then I'll have a drink.
