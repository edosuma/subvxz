this week's weed!

07:50.929 --> 07:53.307
They can spend their
hard-earned cash on anything!

07:53.432 --> 07:55.350
They could buy candy.
They could buy cookies.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.727
They could buy Band-Aids.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.187
- Ice creams?
- Yeah.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.272
- Ring Pops?
- Yeah, Ring Pops, for sure.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.524
- Popcorns?
- Duster? Like a jacket?

08:02.649 --> 08:05.194
- They could go-they could buy
a duster jacket or the car.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.862
- Fun Dip candy?
- That's the point!

08:06.987 --> 08:08.238
They could buy anything,

08:08.363 --> 08:09.782
and what they want
to spend their money on

08:09.907 --> 08:11.408
is our burweedos!

08:11.533 --> 08:13.285
And you guys are back here
just chiefing the kind?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.287

08:17.164 --> 08:18.582
Hey, not anymore.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.833
Guess what.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.711

08:22.836 --> 08:23.837
- That's right.
- No! What are you doing?

08:23.962 --> 08:24.963
- Give me that joint.
You don't deserve it.

08:25.089 --> 08:26.090
- Hey!
- Excuse me.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.841
Excuse me!
- That is uncalled for.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.511
- We pay you to cook food, okay?
Not bake your brain.

08:30.636 --> 08:31.762
- We have a food critic
coming tomorrow.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.222
- Yes.
- Okay?

08:33.347 --> 08:34.389
And we need you guys
to be 'rito pros,

08:34.515 --> 08:36.767
so please get to the orders.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.018
Chop-chop!
<i>'</i> ChW-Chop. [Claps]

08:38.143 --> 08:39.561
- No one tells me
to chop-chop.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.188
- Thank you.
- You guys are great.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.815
You're good at your jobs.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.107
- Okay, that's it.
What do we have to make-

08:44.232 --> 08:46.193
Like, six burweedos
or something?

08:46.318 --> 08:47.694
- Something to that effect.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.446
- How do you even
make these things? Stupid.

08:49.571 --> 08:52.116
- Ders and Karl-they think they
just know everything, right?

08:52.241 --> 08:54.660
Well, they don't.
They don't know karate.

08:54.785 --> 08:55.869
That's one thing,
and that's just one thing

08:55.994 --> 08:56.995
off the top of my head.
- Yeah.

08:57.121 --> 08:58.831
- I'm a man of the people.
I know what people want.

08:58.956 --> 08:59.957
I know what chicks want-

09:00.082 --> 09:01.458
a tongue,
a lot of tongue action.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.710
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.504
I know what people want.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.256
- How do you even
fold these things, man?

09:07.381 --> 09:09.299
- Blake, I have an idea.
- I swear to God, dude.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.510
Those chicks at Chipotle-
They're, like, warlocks

09:11.635 --> 09:12.678
walking amongst us.

09:12.803 --> 09:13.929
- Blake.
- Huh?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.806
- I have an idea.
- What?

09:15.931 --> 09:17.724
- Well, I forget now,
because you took too long

09:17.850 --> 09:19.560
to ask me what my idea was.

09:19.685 --> 09:20.686
- It's the weed, man.
- It was the weed.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.563
- They say it-
- It affected-

09:22.688 --> 09:24.857
[both laugh]
Cheese.

09:24.982 --> 09:25.983
- What?
- That was it.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.401
Get all the cheese.

09:27.526 --> 09:28.735
- Ooh, all the cheese?
- All the cheese.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.320
- Oh, I already like
this idea, dude.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.488
- Boop!
- Bap!

09:31.613 --> 09:32.823
- The number two's more-

09:32.948 --> 09:33.949
Well, number one comes
with one chip,

09:34.074 --> 09:35.450
so it is different, actually.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.119
- Yo, so I don't mean
to be a dick, bro,

09:37.244 --> 09:39.288
but, dang, what's up
with that weedo, man?

09:39.413 --> 09:42.332
- Yes, sorry. Um, I'll be
right back with your food.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.459
Okay? Sorry.
- Yeah, we'll handle this.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.879
- Come on, boy, you got this!
Get 'em! Get 'em!

09:47.004 --> 09:48.005
- What the hell is this?

09:48.130 --> 09:52.634
- Oh, check it out, man.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.304
It's Shaquille Burrit-O'Neal!

09:55.429 --> 09:56.722
What do you think?

09:56.847 --> 09:58.557
- It's the world's
largest burrito.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.058
We were gonna save it
for the customer,

10:00.184 --> 10:01.852
but then we were like,
"That's crazy.

10:01.977 --> 10:02.978
Why don't we just-"

10:03.103 --> 10:04.688
- Set two world records.
- Yep.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.608
- Making and eating
the world's largest burweedo.

10:07.733 --> 10:10.360
The American dream just keeps
getting more, like, American-er!

10:10.485 --> 10:11.820
- Hey!
Shaquille Burrit-O'Neal

10:11.945 --> 10:14.489
sounds
really freakin' cool, okay?

10:14.615 --> 10:16.783
But we got ten hungry people
out there

10:16.909 --> 10:18.327
waiting for their burweedos,

10:18.452 --> 10:20.078
and that's really
not freakin' cool.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.206
- Mm, how about you chill
with the tone, Loc?

10:22.331 --> 10:23.582
- Okay, you guys
are off kitchen duty.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.209
That's a fact.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.668
- You know what I got
for you, boys? Check it out.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.337
Found it in the Karl space
this morning.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.671
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.423
- Street duty.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.259
- Oh, you think I'm afraid
of a little mascot action?

10:34.384 --> 10:38.222
Been there, dumb that.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.224
- This is bullcrap, man.
- How old is he?

10:40.349 --> 10:42.184
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding me?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.352
We're not wearing
this thing, man.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.645
Are you frickin' crazy?

10:44.770 --> 10:46.605
It's, like, 100 degrees
out there.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.315
This thing's like a hot box.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.733
- Bees, please.

10:49.858 --> 10:50.901
Keep it 'd rated.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.444
You'll be fine.
- Mm-hmm.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.112
- We're out of here, man.
Back to work!

10:54.238 --> 10:56.323
- You're welcome
for the waters.

10:56.448 --> 10:57.449
- There you go!

10:57.574 --> 10:58.825
- Come get a burrito!
- Yeah.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.494
Good.
Good mascot voice.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.788
- It's so frickin' hot
in here, dude.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.831
The walls-they're closing in
on me, man.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.416
- I'll get you.
Here, you gotta reach-

11:06.541 --> 11:08.961
- Get me out!
- I'm trying to-there we go.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.295

[coughs]
- What the hell, DeMamp?

11:13.382 --> 11:15.717
Why'd you cave?
- Oh, I don't cave.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.469
I blaze.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.971
- What are you
talking about, man?

11:19.096 --> 11:20.180
- It's weed. It's blaze.
I blaze weed.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.556
- No, I know what it is,
man...

11:21.682 --> 11:22.683
- There you go.
- But we can't smoke these.

11:22.808 --> 11:23.809
They'll see us.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.143
- No, I got the idea
from you, dude.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.312
Earlier when you said
"hot box the suit,"

11:27.437 --> 11:29.606
I was like,
"Let's smoke weed in the suits!"

11:29.731 --> 11:30.941
- Oh.
- Right?

11:31.066 --> 11:33.610
If you smoke weed
in the burrito,

11:33.735 --> 11:36.405
they'll never know.
- [laughs]

11:36.530 --> 11:37.948
- Did I look cool
when I just said that?

11:38.073 --> 11:40.117
- No, man.
We look really stupid.

I don't even feel hot anymore.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.264
- Right?
It's like a sauna.

I should be butt naked

- I think it's probably
the skunk.

13:04.743 --> 13:05.744
- Yeah, man,
there's a skunk right there.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.371

what we've built, Karl.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.729
- Maybe we should
stop selling weed.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.356
People like the burritos
just fine without it.

You're such cool bosses.

- Spit-shining the window-
That's awesome.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.460
Soap next time maybe,
though, right?

14:36.585 --> 14:37.836
Yeah.
- Uh, sure.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.172
- Yeah, yeah.
- Outfit brother.

14:40.297 --> 14:43.800
- What? Oh!
What? Oh, my God!

14:43.925 --> 14:45.343
- Look at this!
- This is crazy.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.887
- It's like the same thing.
- Oh, lookit-

14:47.012 --> 14:48.096
- What are you saying?
I have tits?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.890
- No.
It's a good color.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.141
- Don't-
- That's tight.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.893
- Oh, my-dude,
fire, fire in here!

14:53.018 --> 14:54.686
<i>_</i> Ho! H0!

14:54.811 --> 14:55.979
- Fire!
- What's burning?

14:56.104 --> 14:57.731
- Oh, good morning, guys.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.566
Figured we'd just
get here a little early.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.943
Marinate the meats
for the big-time food critic!

15:02.068 --> 15:04.279
- Yeah.
Uh, awesome.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.282
Thank you.
- No. Thank you, dudes.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.825
Getting up early
and working hard,

15:08.950 --> 15:10.744
that's The American Dream,
Dusty Rhodes.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.330
- Right on. Very well said.
- Good for you.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.998
- All right,
you keep that grill hot,

15:15.123 --> 15:16.750
and we'll let you know
when it's time to grind.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.543
- [laughs]
We-we will.

15:18.668 --> 15:19.920
- All right.
- Love you, bitch.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.379
- Yeah, peace out, gang.
- [laughs]

15:21.505 --> 15:23.048
- You're crossing
your fingers, right?

15:23.173 --> 15:24.424
Okay, good.
Thank God.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.717
- Testing, testing.
- [spits]

15:25.842 --> 15:27.010
- We on the mic-

15:27.135 --> 15:28.303
What are you doing?

15:28.428 --> 15:29.596
What did I tell you?
Karl, come on.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.097
- I'm cleaning.
- But-

15:31.223 --> 15:33.767
- Oh, right, I'm supposed
to use soup.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.143
- Soap-
- soap-

15:35.268 --> 15:36.478
- Have you been using soup?

15:36.603 --> 15:37.854
- Hi,
I'm Drew Darnell,

15:37.979 --> 15:39.773
food critic
for the Rancho Review.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.316
- Welcome!
- I'm the reason

15:41.441 --> 15:44.152
the Togo's in Rancho
is never not packed.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.029
- No kidding.
Well, that sounds great.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.989
Why don't you take a seat,
Mr. Darnell?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.492
And, uh, Karl,
if you would just go-

15:50.617 --> 15:51.618
- Yep. Sure.
- I'll be right back

15:51.743 --> 15:52.744
with your meal, sir.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.162
- Okay, Mr. Darnell.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.539
Let's have you take a sit.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.374
Would you like any water?

15:57.499 --> 16:00.168
Maybe a flat faucet
or perhaps some hose water?

16:00.293 --> 16:01.836
- I brought my own.
- He's here.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.340
So please give us
your best, buds.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.591
[laughter]

16:06.716 --> 16:07.717
- Best buds!
- Best buds.

16:07.842 --> 16:08.927
- Best buds!
- Okay, okay.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.471
- I get it.
That's funny.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.056
- Kick-ass.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.434
He's gonna love this.
Ugh!

16:16.560 --> 16:19.980
- A little cheese, lettuce,
and now for the main event.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.524
- Okay, and-is that his dick?
- What is that?

16:22.649 --> 16:23.900
- All right, let me
really get in here.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.318
- Yeah, there we go.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.695
Stab in there.
Get in there deep. Yep.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.238
- This is what they get

16:28.363 --> 16:29.656
for making us work
like dogs, man.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.325
Killing our dream-
burritos and weed.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.451
- I'll hold it.
- Okay, ready?

16:33.577 --> 16:34.578
- Stab it! Yeah.
- [grunts]

16:34.703 --> 16:35.912
- Oh.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.664
- Oh, something-
Something popped.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.794
[beatboxing]

16:42.919 --> 16:45.171
- Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding!

16:45.297 --> 16:46.840
Ringing the dinner bell.
- Here we go.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.216
- Ringing the dinner bell.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.509
I'm just ringing
the dinner bell.

16:49.634 --> 16:50.927
- I was saying
we gotta get a bell.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.220
- Dinner is...
- Yeah. We got to get one.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.389
- Served.
- It is our pleasure

16:54.514 --> 16:55.932
to serve to you
what I would argue

16:56.057 --> 16:58.184
may be the finest burrito

16:58.310 --> 16:59.978
this little, plucky shop
has ever whipped up.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.355
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Bon appe-teach.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.316
- Okay. Thanks, guys.
- Enjoy.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.318
- You got it.
- They're good boys.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.320
- So it's gonna be
about 1.2 pounds...

17:09.445 --> 17:11.071
- Mm-hmm.
- And seven chips.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.406
It's a classic combo.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.201
- That's a good weight.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.493
Uh, wait.
Hang on a second.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.122
Um, yeah.
This thing's cold.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.665
This thing's ice cold, guys.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.250
You're gonna want it
piping hot.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.376
They're really good
when they're hot-

17:23.501 --> 17:24.502
- Pfft.
I'll take it, man.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.628
- Wait. I't'S-
- I'll take it.

17:25.753 --> 17:26.755
- It's cold, though.
- What is this-

17:26.880 --> 17:28.048
Beef or asada?
- I don't know.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.258
- We just added beef
to our menu.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.553
Ah, I'll figure it Out.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.015
Oh, that's beef.
- Oh, yeah?

17:37.140 --> 17:39.100
- That was beef.
Yeah. I love the beef one.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.393
Oh, excuse me.
[chuckles]

17:40.518 --> 17:41.645
- [laughs]
- Dripping a little bit.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.188
- Hey. guys,
if we could just get

17:43.313 --> 17:45.065
one more classic burrito
out here for Mr. Darnell,

17:45.190 --> 17:46.316
that'd be great.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.942
- Coming right up, boss!

17:48.068 --> 17:49.444
- Yeah, get-hold that up.
Hold that up.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.612
Scrape the maggots.
- Oh, yeah.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.781
- You're gonna dig-
this is solid stuff right here.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.407
- [spits]
- Here, let me get-

17:54.532 --> 17:55.909
Let me get some B-hole hairs.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.118
- [laughs]
Nice. Ooh, ooh.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.746
Good call.
- Ooh! Ooh! Oh!

17:59.871 --> 18:01.122
<i>- Ooh.
- Oh, how mow.</i>

18:01.247 --> 18:02.374
- Ew.
- All right.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.583
- [laughs]
- Sprinkle, sprinkle.

18:03.708 --> 18:07.504
- What's the red sauce?
- Mmm.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.005
- I cannot wait
for you to try this.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.965
- And the juice is loose!

18:11.091 --> 18:14.052
<i>One 'May 'mo.
- Very hot-</i>

18:14.177 --> 18:15.762
Very piping hot.
You're gonna enjoy.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.056
- And it's classic?
- It's so classic, Anders.

18:18.181 --> 18:19.474
- Oh, yeah, I'd call it

18:19.599 --> 18:20.767
an instant classic, for sure.
- Mm-hmm.

18:20.892 --> 18:21.893
You're never gonna
forget this one.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.728
Both: Mmm.
- Yum, yum, yum.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.980
[both purr]
Yum.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.107
- Oh!
- So classic.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.400
- Whoa, okay!

18:28.525 --> 18:30.652
Okay, I think
we all saw the steam

18:30.777 --> 18:32.278
shoot out of that one-
Too hot.

18:32.404 --> 18:33.988
- I really don't mind.
- No, let the man eat.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.240
- Let's just get him
another one.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.449
- Why aren't you eating it?

18:36.574 --> 18:37.909
Do you not like the food here?

18:38.034 --> 18:39.953
- I love the food here.
It's really good.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.788
I just-
I don't need to eat it.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.540
Why don't you eat it?
- I don't like the food here.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.334
- He does not mean that.
- The food here is-it's good.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.752
It-it's good.
See?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.129
- Mm.
It's pink.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.463
I don't know what part
that was, but...

18:50.588 --> 18:51.589
- Ooh.
- Mmm.

18:51.715 --> 18:52.716
- That's not guacamole.

18:52.841 --> 18:53.842
Both: Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.218
- [whispers]
Maggots, Anders.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.137
You're eating maggots.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.430
- This is so good.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.223
- Why don't we get
one more burrito

19:00.348 --> 19:04.602
for Drew Darnell, the man that
could put Best Buds on the map?

19:04.728 --> 19:05.937
- You're right.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.313
- That would be awesome,

19:07.439 --> 19:09.023
'cause this one
is freakin' bomb.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.609
- The thing about these burritos
that I love

19:11.735 --> 19:13.862
is that you need one bite,
and you're full.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.448
- Boom shakalaka!
- Mmm. Dig in.

19:16.573 --> 19:17.657
- Yeah, the whole table

19:17.782 --> 19:19.576
can enjoy that one.
- Mm-hmm.

19:19.701 --> 19:20.994
- So we're done here, right?

19:21.119 --> 19:22.620
- Yeah.
- Sure you don't want a bite?

19:22.746 --> 19:24.372
- Sure.
- Ah!

19:24.497 --> 19:26.624
What the hell?
- Wait a-

19:26.750 --> 19:28.877
ls there skunk in this burrito?
- Yes!

19:29.002 --> 19:30.295
- Is there skunk
in this burrito?

19:30.420 --> 19:32.672
- Yeah, Karl, there is skunk
in the burrito,

19:32.797 --> 19:36.259
because you two were acting
like assholes, all right?

19:36.384 --> 19:38.011
This was supposed
to be our dream, man.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.929
We quit our jobs for this.
Now look at it.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.723
This place sucks.
I hate working here.

19:41.848 --> 19:46.227
- Yeah. It was supposed to be
all about weed, burritos...

19:46.352 --> 19:47.520
That was it.
Just two dreams.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.564
- You know what?
You dudes are right.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.108
I was really acting
like this nut sack too much.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.818
- Thank God you realize that.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.153
- I'm gonna go back
to selling weed

19:55.278 --> 19:57.113
on the streets illegally,
all right?

19:57.238 --> 19:59.991
And I don't care if you're
12 years old or 13 years old.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.743
I'm selling weed to you.
- Okay.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.286
- Got the tween market on lock.
I like that.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.538
- Good, man, let's get back
to the basics.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.499
I mean, half the reason
I like doing drugs anyways

20:07.624 --> 20:08.625
is 'cause they're illegal.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.044
- [breathing heavily]

20:11.169 --> 20:14.130
- Okay, so we took
a risk, right?

20:14.255 --> 20:16.466
The least you could do
is commend our efforts

20:16.591 --> 20:18.092
and welcome us back
with open arms-

20:18.218 --> 20:21.054
Strong ones, I might add.
And I did, right then.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.806
- Alice, the thing
you need to think about is,

20:22.931 --> 20:25.099
what would happen
if you didn't hire us back'?

20:25.225 --> 20:27.101
- Yeah, like, all hell
would just break loose.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.521
I mean, Waymond would go
fully postal service

20:29.646 --> 20:31.648
by, you know,
starting his own band.

20:31.773 --> 20:32.982
You'd probably
have to go to the gigs.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.359
- But look, here's the deal.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.027
We don't just
want our jobs back.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.321
Mm-mm.
We want a raise-

20:38.446 --> 20:40.031
At least 50¢ an hour.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.658
- Okay, check this out.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.452
You're back to your starting pay
of $9.00 an hour.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.830
- $9.00 an hour?

20:46.955 --> 20:49.332
Are you kidding me?
That is fantastic.

20:49.457 --> 20:50.959
- Wow. Wow.
- What?

20:51.084 --> 20:52.752
I'm like, what,
we make 9 bucks?

20:52.877 --> 20:54.212
I didn't know we made that much.
- That's kind of a lot.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.422
- Dudes, American dream.
- Thank you so much.

20:56.548 --> 20:57.882
- We're living it.
- This job rules.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.884
- Nice!

21:00.009 --> 21:01.970
[dog snorts]
[Party horn blows]

21:05.056 --> 21:06.641
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

21:06.766 --> 21:07.767
- Shit, shit.
- Fuck!

21:07.892 --> 21:10.436
- Shit. Are you okay?
- Ow!

21:10.562 --> 21:13.147
- Oh! Give me the joint.
- Dick. Ow.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.691
- I'm really sorry about that.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.067
I didn't mean to.
I'm so-l'm sorry!

21:16.192 --> 21:17.569
- That's not the kind
of business we're running!

21:17.694 --> 21:18.778
- Asshole.
- I said I was sorry!

21:18.903 --> 21:20.029
Listen-
- Ow!
