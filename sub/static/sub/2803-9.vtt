WEBVTT

00:01.349 --> 00:03.612
PREVIOUSLY ON "WHITE COLLAR"...

00:03.699 --> 00:05.788
Moz: TO OUR BEST
AND FINALSCORE.

00:07.746 --> 00:08.704
WHAT IS IT?

00:08.791 --> 00:09.966
Diana:
PART OF THE ORIGINAL

00:10.053 --> 00:11.054
GERMAN U-BOAT MANIFEST.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.534
YOU STILL THINK
CAFFREY HAS THE ART?

00:12.621 --> 00:14.275
I DON'T KNOW.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.755
WHOEVER STOLE IT,
IF A SINGLE ITEM ON THIS LIST

00:16.842 --> 00:18.714
SHOWS UP ANYWHERE --WE GOT 'EM.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.108
YEAH. WE GOT 'EM.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.370
DID YOU FIND THE SAFE?

00:22.457 --> 00:25.242
THE MANIFEST WASN'T IN THERE,
MOZ. I'M SORRY.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.505
Neal: OH, COME ON, SARA,
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN WHO I AM.

00:27.592 --> 00:28.985
Sara:
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.769
I GUESS YOU FIGURED OUT
EVERYTHING I HAVE TO OFFER.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.467
CAFFREY, PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.087
VAN DYCK --
"PORTRAIT OF A BOY."

00:44.174 --> 00:45.393
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:46.611 --> 00:48.135
THERE IT IS.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.836
DEGAS -- "MASKED DANCERS."

00:53.923 --> 00:56.708
OH, COME ON.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.974
MOZ, THANK GOD
YOU DIDN'T SELL IT.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.065
HEY.
Moz: THEY KNOW
ABOUT THE TREASURE.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.718
THEY'RE ON TO US.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.546
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:12.333 --> 01:14.900
"GHOST SHIP FOUND
WITH HITLER CLONES"?

01:14.987 --> 01:16.206
"AND PRICELESS ART."

01:16.293 --> 01:17.729
OURPRICELESS ART.
OOH, OOH.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.818
THEY'RE ALSO ON TO
A VEGAN VAMPIRE

01:19.905 --> 01:21.298
RAVAGING
COMMUNITY GARDENS.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.300
LOOK, THERE'S NO NEED
TO HIT THE PANIC BUTTON.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.433
NEAL, THIS IS WHERE
OUR TREASURE HAS REACHED

01:25.520 --> 01:27.783
WHAT MALCOLM GLADWELL WOULD CALL
A "TIPPING POINT."

01:27.870 --> 01:30.177
FORENSICS DOESN'T TALK,
NOR DOES PETER.

01:30.264 --> 01:32.483
YEAH, BUT THE SUIT
AND HIS SUIT COHORTS

01:32.570 --> 01:34.877
BROUGHT IN D.C. ART CRIMES,
ONE OF WHOM

01:34.964 --> 01:37.749
WAS WILLING TO SPILL
THE NAZI BEANS IN A HOTEL BAR.

01:37.836 --> 01:38.968
UH-HUH.
SHE THOUGHT I WAS INTERPOL.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.578
MY POINT EXACTLY.

01:40.665 --> 01:43.364
I GET IT, MOZ.
SECRETS CAN'T BE KEPT FOREVER.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.670
BUT NO ONE
CAN TRACE THIS TO US.

01:45.757 --> 01:49.021
EXCEPT HALE, WHO I'VE ALREADY
LINED UP TO FENCE THE DEGAS.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.111
OH, AND SARA,

01:51.198 --> 01:53.852
THE HALF-SUIT WHO SUDDENLY
BROKE THINGS OFF.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.811
I'M GONNA SEE HER TODAY.
I'LL FIND OUT WHAT SHE KNOWS.

01:55.898 --> 01:58.248
SKIP IT.
LET'S JUST GO.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.076
VÃ¡MONOS.
WE DON'T HAVE
THE MEANS.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.470
WE WILL
IF WE SELL THE DEGAS.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.080
NO. THAT IS
TOO HIGH-PROFILE.

02:04.167 --> 02:05.821
THE FBI ONLY HAS
A PARTIAL LIST.

02:05.908 --> 02:08.084
THE ODDS ARE MINISCULE
THAT THE DEGAS IS EVEN ON IT.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.999
BUT IF IT IS
AND WE SELL IT --

02:10.086 --> 02:13.829
WE'LL BE LONG GONE BEFORE ANYONE
CAN SAY "DEGAS AWAY WITH IT."

02:13.916 --> 02:15.874
AND WHEREVER WE GO,
I AM TELLING YOU,

02:15.961 --> 02:18.138
THE FBI, PETER, WILL NOT STOP
UNTIL THEY FIND US.

02:19.922 --> 02:23.143
BUT WE CAN'T LEAVE UNTIL WE HAVE
THAT LIST. ALL RIGHT?

02:37.069 --> 02:39.811
MUCH AS I'D LOVE
A CANDY-APPLE SET OF LOCK PICKS,

02:39.898 --> 02:41.639
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT THIS BACK.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.163
THANK YOU.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.991
I'D LOVE TO CATCH UP,
BUT I'M LATE FOR A MEETING.

02:46.078 --> 02:47.819
WAS IT THE PASSPORTS?NO, IT WASN'T.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.778
THEN WHAT WAS IT?
I KNOW YOU, SARA.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.607
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE CUT
OUT LIKE THAT UNLESS
YOU HAD A REASON TO.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.304
OKAY, FINE.
IT WAS THE PASSPORTS.

02:54.391 --> 02:56.176
YOU HAD BRILLIANTLY
FORGED I.D.s,

02:56.263 --> 02:58.003
AND IT DAWNED ON ME --
YOU'RE A CON MAN.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.004
ARE YOU HAPPY?
NO.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.311
I WANT THE TRUTH.

03:01.398 --> 03:04.401
Neal...
I saw the treasure.

03:04.488 --> 03:08.100
I SAW IT ON YOUR LAPTOP.
YOU HID IT FROM ME.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.494
YOU HID IT FROM PETER, AND
YOU'RE HIDING IT FROM THE FBI.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.931
AND NOW YOU'RE HERE TO
FIND OUT IF I'M GONNA
KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.411
IT'S NOT
AS COLD AS THAT.

03:14.498 --> 03:15.804
REALLY?
THEN WHAT IS IT?

03:15.891 --> 03:19.068
NOW YOU OWE ME
THE TRUTH.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.201
WERE YOU GONNA SAY
GOOD-BYE TO ME?

03:22.419 --> 03:23.638
NO.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.469
SARA.
WHAT?!

03:28.556 --> 03:30.471
WOULD YOU
HAVE COME WITH ME?

03:30.558 --> 03:33.430
WOULD I HAVE
COME WITH YOU?

03:33.517 --> 03:35.127
HOW WOULD THAT
HAVE WORKED?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.478
WE'D JUST GO.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.001
THE WHOLE WORLD
AT OUR FEET?

03:44.615 --> 03:46.226
I CAME SO CLOSE
TO ASKING YOU.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.923
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.185
NO.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.447
WELL, THEN,
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.188
Peter: SARA.

03:52.275 --> 03:55.844
THIS EXPLAINS WHY NEAL
ISN'T PICKING UP HIS PHONE.

03:55.931 --> 03:58.107
WELL...

03:58.194 --> 04:00.892
I WOULD HATE TO KEEP NEAL
FROM HIS CRIME-SOLVING DUTIES.

04:00.979 --> 04:02.503
TAKE CARE, SARA.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.201
IT'S GOOD TO
SEE YOU, PETER.

04:05.288 --> 04:06.202
YOU TOO.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.990
YOU'VE COME TO COLLECT ME
IN PERSON.

04:12.077 --> 04:14.297
I'M HESITANT TO ASK,
BUT WHY?

04:14.384 --> 04:15.733
WE GOT WORD
ON MATTHEW KELLER.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.827
MATTHEW KELLER --
NEAL'S EX-PARTNER.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.046
THAT'S STRETCHING IT.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.656
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,
LAST YEAR,

04:25.743 --> 04:27.354
KELLER BROKE OUT OF PRISON

04:27.441 --> 04:30.270
DURING HIS TRANSFER
TO A MAXIMUM-SECURITY FACILITY.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.141
HE ALSO ARRANGED
TO HAVE YOU KIDNAPPED.

04:32.228 --> 04:35.144
I REMEMBER THAT.
UNFORTUNATELY, HE GOT AWAY THEN.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.842
BUT UP UNTIL THIS WEEK,
HIS TRAIL WAS COLD.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.061
JONES?

04:39.148 --> 04:40.584
KELLER RECENTLY
TURNED UP

04:40.671 --> 04:43.805
ON SOME SECURITY FOOTAGE
IN EGYPT.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.894
APPARENTLY,
HE'S BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE

04:45.981 --> 04:48.157
OF THE POLITICAL UNREST
IN THE REGION.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.159
WHILE THE PEOPLE AND POLICE
TAKE TO THE STREETS,

04:50.246 --> 04:51.769
HE TAKES PRICELESS PIECES
FROM MUSEUMS.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.162
CLASSIC KELLER.

04:53.249 --> 04:54.946
WELL, THIS TIME,
HE DID WELL FOR HIMSELF.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.644
HE STOLE THIS --
YOU'RE LOOKING AT

04:56.731 --> 04:58.776
A ONE-OF-A-KIND
3,500-YEAR-OLD AMULET.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.474
ONCE IN THE TOMB
OF NARMER THE FIRST.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.127
THE AMULET
OF THE LOST PHARAOH.

05:02.214 --> 05:05.827
THE NEW EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT
CONSIDERS IT A NATIONAL TREASURE

05:05.914 --> 05:07.611
AND, OBVIOUSLY,
IRREPLACEABLE.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.265
DO WE HAVE ANY LEADS
ON WHERE KELLER MAY BE?

05:09.352 --> 05:11.659
HE'S OFF THE GRID AGAIN,
BUT THE EGYPTIANS BELIEVE

05:11.746 --> 05:13.748
THE AMULET'S BEEN SMUGGLED
INTO MANHATTAN.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.533
THE BUREAU WANTS US
TO FIND IT AND RETURN IT.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.623
WE EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION,
GIVEN KELLER'S INVOLVEMENT.

05:19.710 --> 05:22.887
HE'S IN OUR CITY --
WE BRING HIM TO JUSTICE.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.106
NEAL, LET'S TALK.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.024
WHAT DO YOU THINK
KELLER'S UP TO?

05:29.111 --> 05:30.417
IT'S TOO EARLY
TO TELL.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.157
WHATEVER
WE THINK HE'S DOING,

05:32.244 --> 05:34.377
HE'S PROBABLY
THREE STEPS PAST IT BY NOW.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.336
WHY RISK DOING BUSINESS
IN THE U.S.,

05:36.423 --> 05:37.815
WITH SOMEONE
IN NEW YORK?

05:37.902 --> 05:39.164
OH, HE'S ALWAYS
BEEN BRAZEN.

05:39.251 --> 05:40.209
MM.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.733
[ CHUCKLES ]

05:42.820 --> 05:44.605
THINK THEY'RE
ON TO US?

05:44.692 --> 05:46.346
[ CHUCKLES ]

05:46.433 --> 05:47.477
HAS KELLER CONTACTED YOU?

05:47.564 --> 05:48.913
NO. WHY?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.480
AS HARD AS WE'VE TRIED,

05:50.567 --> 05:52.482
VERSIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED
TO ADLER'S SUB HAVE LEAKED OUT.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.615
IT'S HARD TO KEEP
A SECRET THAT BIG.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.617
YEAH.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.358
KELLER'S A SMART GUY.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.447
HE STARTS PUTTING
THOSE RUMORS TOGETHER...

06:00.534 --> 06:03.014
YOU'RE WONDERING IF HE MADE
THE SAME ASSUMPTION YOU DID.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.365
IF HE'S THINKING
YOU'RE IN POSSESSION

06:05.452 --> 06:07.671
OF $1 BILLION
WORTH OF LOST ARTWORK,

06:07.758 --> 06:09.760
THAT'S A REASON
BIG ENOUGH TO DRAW HIM BACK.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.632
FOR IT, AND FOR YOU.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.895
IF HE THINKS
I STOLE THE TREASURE,

06:13.982 --> 06:15.810
LET'S USE IT
TO TAKE HIM DOWN.

06:46.449 --> 06:49.060
WE FOUND IT --
THE NEW YORK CONNECTION

06:49.147 --> 06:51.019
BETWEEN THE EGYPTIAN
STOLEN AMULET AND KELLER.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.063
GREAT.
ANYBODY WE KNOW?

06:52.150 --> 06:53.108
YOU TELL ME.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.936
THE EGYPTIANS BELIEVE

06:55.023 --> 06:56.590
THE SHIPMENT WAS SENT

06:56.677 --> 06:58.505
TO AN ANCIENT-CIVILIZATIONS
EXPERT IN SoHo

06:58.592 --> 07:00.289
NAMED RAQUEL LaROQUE.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.204
I KNOW THE NAME.
SHE'S AN EGYPTOLOGIST.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.075
APPARENTLY,
THAT'S HER DAY JOB.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.164
SHE'S A FENCE?

07:06.251 --> 07:07.470
AND A DAMN GOOD ONE.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.516
CHECK OUT
HER CONCEALMENT TECHNIQUE.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.996
THE SHIPMENTS SHE GETS

07:12.083 --> 07:14.738
LOOK LIKE
EGYPTIAN GIFT-SHOP TCHOTCHKES.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.784
BUT IN REALITY...

07:16.871 --> 07:20.614
THEY'RE HIGHLY DURABLE
X-RAY-PROOF MOLDS

07:20.701 --> 07:23.051
BUILT AROUND REAL,
PRICELESS ARTIFACTS.

07:23.138 --> 07:25.445
THE MUMMY RETURNS.
SEXY.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.708
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE THAT.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.449
MS. LaROQUE
HAS PUT OUT WORD

07:29.536 --> 07:31.799
THAT SHE'S IN THE MARKET
FOR A RESTORATION TECH.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.104
SHE NEEDS SOMEONE

07:33.191 --> 07:35.106
TO EXTRACT THE ARTIFACTS
WITHOUT DAMAGING THEM.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.412
IT'S CHALLENGING WORK.

07:36.499 --> 07:37.892
MM. KNOW ANYONE
WHO CAN PULL IT OFF?

07:39.459 --> 07:42.113
TALK TO YOUR CRIME SUPER FRIENDS
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.725
WE GET THIS AMULET,
WE'RE ONE STEP CLOSER TO KELLER.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.248
ALL RIGHT.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.776
HEY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT RAQUEL LaROQUE?

07:52.863 --> 07:54.909
NOT MUCH BEYOND
SHE'S AN EGYPTOLOGIST.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.301
I HEAR SHE'S SPICY.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.912
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:57.999 --> 08:01.524
I DON'T KNOW. NOT ALL
MY INFORMATION'S HELPFUL.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.178
HALE.
[ LAUGHS ]

08:03.265 --> 08:04.484
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

08:04.571 --> 08:06.660
OOH!

08:06.747 --> 08:09.880
I HEARD MOZ DID SOME WORK
ON YOUR MOBILE OFFICE.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.753
YEAH, I'M STILL LEARNING
ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.146
MOZZIE REFUSES TO WRITE DOWN
INSTRUCTIONS.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.626
OBVIOUSLY, WE DON'T WANT

08:16.713 --> 08:18.846
ANY PUBLIC RECORD
OF OUR MODIFICATIONS.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.501
I'LL SETTLE FOR THAT DEGAS
YOU KEEP PROMISING.

08:21.588 --> 08:22.589
IT'S COMING. SOON.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.504
YEAH, WE HAD
A MINOR COMPLICATION.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.810
WHAT IF WE COULD GET YOU
SOMETHING BETTER?

08:26.897 --> 08:29.596
WELL, MY BUYER HAS HIS HEART SET
ON THAT DEGAS --

08:29.683 --> 08:31.075
BEFORE WE CAN MOVE
ANY OF IT,

08:31.162 --> 08:32.773
DO YOU KNOW A FENCE
NAMED RAQUEL LaROQUE?

08:32.860 --> 08:34.165
I DO.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.559
SHE HAS THIS INTRICATE
CONCEALMENT TECHNIQUE.

08:36.646 --> 08:39.040
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'D
LIKE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.346
SHE'S IN THE MARKET
FOR A NEW RESTORATION TECH.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.826
IF YOU GET THE JOB,

08:42.913 --> 08:46.134
THAT WILL HELP ELIMINATE
YOUR DELAY WITH THE DEGAS?

08:46.221 --> 08:50.225
UH, YES. UH, YOU VOUCH FOR NEAL,
IT WILL EXPEDITE THE SALE.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.226
NEAL?

08:51.313 --> 08:53.184
IT WILL.

08:53.271 --> 08:56.318
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I'LL SET UP A MEETING.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.671
[ TAPPING ]

09:03.238 --> 09:04.805
YOUR GUY'S VERY LATE.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.155
HE'LL SHOW.
HALE IS VERY RELIABLE.

09:07.242 --> 09:09.549
[ TAPPING ]

09:09.636 --> 09:10.550
YOU AND SARA?

09:11.855 --> 09:13.814
YES. ME AND SARA.
OVER?

09:14.945 --> 09:15.990
YES.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.339
SO WHAT I WITNESSED...

09:17.426 --> 09:19.123
RETURN
OF THE BREAKUP BAG.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.255
ALL RIGHT.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.344
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU GUYS?

09:22.431 --> 09:26.130
AND DON'T GIVE ME THE "WE'RE
JUST DIFFERENT PEOPLE" ROUTINE.

09:26.217 --> 09:29.612
WE ARE VERY

41:21.391 --> 41:23.959
NO. THAT'S EXACTLY
THE SALE PRICE OF THE DEGAS.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.395
YOU FENCED IT.

41:28.311 --> 41:30.270
YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED ME.

41:30.357 --> 41:32.011
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD ME

41:32.098 --> 41:33.839
SARA KNEW
ABOUT THE WAREHOUSE.

41:33.926 --> 41:35.623
I GUESS WE'RE IN THE HABIT
OF KEEPING SECRETS NOW.

41:35.710 --> 41:37.016
YOU TOOK OUT A HIT
ON KELLER?

41:37.103 --> 41:38.496
HE KILLED HALE.

41:39.758 --> 41:41.411
HE WENT AFTER SARA.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.239
KELLER WASN'T GONNA STOP
TILL HE DESTROYS YOU.

41:43.326 --> 41:45.067
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO SELL IT.

41:45.154 --> 41:47.635
IT WAS ALL SET UP.
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO
FENCE ANYTHING ELSE.

41:47.722 --> 41:50.943
IT'S ON THE LIST, MOZ!
IT'S ON THE DAMN LIST.

41:51.030 --> 41:52.292
EXCUSE ME?

41:55.034 --> 41:56.688
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

41:56.775 --> 41:59.125
YOU TOLD ME WHEN YOU
BROKE INTO PETER'S HOUSE

41:59.212 --> 42:00.300
THE LIST WASN'T THERE.

42:00.387 --> 42:01.301
IT WAS.

42:02.563 --> 42:03.999
YOU LIED TO ME?

42:04.086 --> 42:05.871
WE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS,
ALL RIGHT?

42:05.958 --> 42:08.961
WHEN THE DEGAS TURNS UP --
AND IT WILL --

42:09.048 --> 42:11.441
THE FBI IS GONNA KNOW
THE TREASURE DIDN'T BURN.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.095
AND WE'RE
THE PRIME SUSPECTS.

42:13.182 --> 42:15.358
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

42:15.445 --> 42:17.317
LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.
WHO DID YOU FENCE IT THROUGH?

42:19.711 --> 42:21.887
WE HAVE TO GET IT BACK.

42:21.974 --> 42:23.671
OR WE'RE DONE, MOZ.

42:25.673 --> 42:27.196
WE'RE DONE.
