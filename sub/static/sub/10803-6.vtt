There was no sign
of any similar creatures

33:36.556 --> 33:38.849
or any unusual interphasic activity.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.100
PICARD:
What about Mr. Data?

33:40.268 --> 33:42.728
There must be some connection
between his odd behavior

33:42.895 --> 33:46.023
and these creatures.
Is he infested as well?

33:46.190 --> 33:49.443
No. I scanned him,
but I found nothing.

33:50.319 --> 33:52.487
Data attacked Counselor Troi

33:52.655 --> 33:55.991
because he saw a mouth
on her shoulder.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.661
And it was in that same area
that we first saw one of the organisms.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.663
Data also saw a straw in my head,

34:01.831 --> 34:04.499
and then Beverly discovered
an organism in the same place.

34:04.667 --> 34:07.419
Those images
are all part of Data's dream.

34:07.587 --> 34:11.131
Maybe somehow he is unconsciously
perceiving these creatures.

34:12.592 --> 34:17.304
Then perhaps it is time that we took
a closer look at Mr. Data's dreams.

34:19.098 --> 34:21.016
It is an interesting hypothesis.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.852
If I am being affected
by these interphasic creatures

34:24.020 --> 34:25.687
on an unconscious level,

34:25.855 --> 34:28.148
it may also explain
my waking dreams

34:28.316 --> 34:31.443
and my subsequent
antisocial behavior.

34:31.611 --> 34:34.654
What we wanna do, Data,
is link your neural net to the holodeck

34:34.822 --> 34:36.656
and have you activate
your dream program,

34:36.824 --> 34:39.701
so as you dream,
we can observe the dream images.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.870
Perhaps we can learn more
about these creatures

34:42.038 --> 34:45.040
by interpreting the symbols and images
of your dreams.

34:45.208 --> 34:48.877
I see. The concept is similar
to the method of directed dreaming.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.713
Exactly. How soon can you have
the link ready?

34:51.881 --> 34:54.966
We'll need about an hour to establish
all the interface parameters.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.802
Make it so.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.472
In the meantime, Mr. Data,

35:00.640 --> 35:02.766
I suggest
that you should prepare for bed.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.360
I think we're ready, captain.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.278
The link is active

35:15.446 --> 35:19.074
and the holodeck has been calibrated
to Data's neural net.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.495

- Yes, sir.

35:24.413 --> 35:26.915
Normally, I would wish you
pleasant dreams.

35:27.083 --> 35:31.128

36:02.869 --> 36:05.787
Can we speak to Data directly
or would that wake him up?

36:05.955 --> 36:08.874
He should be perceiving this
as just another part of his dream.

Anything we say to him
will be taken in that context.

That is the same place
that Data stabbed her.

36:43.534 --> 36:47.120
In his waking dream, he said that
there was a mouth on her shoulder.

36:47.288 --> 36:52.834
They're both symbols of consumption.
Mouth, food.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.087
Mr. Data, what kind of cake is this?

36:57.006 --> 36:59.132
It is a cellular peptide cake.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.218

The creatures infesting the Enterprise
