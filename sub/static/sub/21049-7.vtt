WEBVTT

00:07.674 --> 00:08.925
Okay!

00:09.717 --> 00:11.803
-Got you some snacks and sandwiches.
-Okay.

00:11.886 --> 00:14.306
Got a bottle of champagne
for Abby from me

00:14.389 --> 00:16.266
and a six-pack for tailgating.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.934
What, no beer for the road?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.478
-[clicks tongue]
-I'm kidding.

00:20.562 --> 00:23.315
I'll grab some from the liquor store
on the way out of town.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.608
You know there's a snowstorm coming.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.902
Oh, don't worry,
I'm gonna drive real fast.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.947
Did I just invent NASCAR in the snow?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.366
Where you heading?

00:33.450 --> 00:36.703
Oh, taking Abby on a little surprise trip
for her birthday.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.123
Don't you wanna know what the surprise is?

00:40.207 --> 00:43.210
Honestly, I regret
asking the first question.

00:44.961 --> 00:48.965
She's like maple bacon.
Sweet but salty. [laughs]

00:52.469 --> 00:53.720
-Hey, Ma! [sighs]
-Hey, honey!

00:53.803 --> 00:55.763
Hey, can I get a couple beers?

00:55.847 --> 00:57.474
-Sure, sweetie.
-Hey!

00:57.557 --> 01:00.060
-Oh, relax, they're expired anyway.
-[Colt sighs]

01:02.645 --> 01:05.232
How'd it go at work?
Glad you got all that work done?

01:05.982 --> 01:07.400
Yeah, it went fine.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.694
I'm happy I could help.

01:10.903 --> 01:13.865
You don't have to thank me.
I'm a 32", 34" in Wranglers.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.783
You just do with that information
what you will.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.162
-[Vicky] Fuck you, Clint!
-Okay, let's just calm down.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.123
Don't tell me to calm down!

01:21.206 --> 01:24.209
-Oh, shit, we got a Walmart breakup.
-[chuckles]

01:24.292 --> 01:25.918
What are you talking about?

01:26.002 --> 01:29.005
Oh, it's a drinking game for when
white trash couples fight in public.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.841
One drink if she cusses,
two if she slaps him.

01:31.924 --> 01:34.302
And you gotta chug your whole beer
if she throws a drink in his face.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.847
I'm so glad you guys are finding
new and creative ways to drink.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.267
-[cell phone chimes]
-We're innovators, Ma.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.436
-[Rooster grunts]
-[Vicky] You're bullshit.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.397
-All right, I gotta go.
-[argument continues]

01:45.480 --> 01:48.275
What? We're just getting ready
to do something real stupid.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.611
Sorry, dude, booty call.
I'll tell Abby you say "what up?"

01:51.694 --> 01:53.155
-[chuckles]
-[Colt grunts]

01:53.238 --> 01:55.990
I'm done with this! And you.

01:56.073 --> 01:58.118
Oh, shit, she gonna throw the drink.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.163
[Shirley and Colt groan]

02:03.665 --> 02:07.043
No, Hank, the game is you only chug
if she throws a drink in his face.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.587
What game?

02:12.006 --> 02:14.008
[theme song playing]

03:15.111 --> 03:18.740
-Whoa! Hey, Ed. [exhales heavily]
-Hey, Rooster.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.326
I was hoping we could meet inside
so I could grab a beer.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.452
[chuckles]

03:23.369 --> 03:26.206
-Way ahead of you,  amigo.
-Oh, thank you.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.498
[sighs heavily]

03:28.333 --> 03:30.668
Look, I appreciate you meeting me.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.630
-I assume you heard I got fired, yeah?
-Yeah.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.425
Look, Ed...
I need your help, all right?

03:37.508 --> 03:40.220
Any way you can call Neumann's Hill
and try and get me my job back?

03:40.970 --> 03:43.180
-[sighs]
-Look, man, I'll do anything, okay?

03:43.265 --> 03:45.767
I'll even go to that meeting,
you know, with the...

03:45.850 --> 03:48.561
with the... The one led by the hot chick
with the... with the big rack.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.273
The sexual harassment seminar?

03:52.189 --> 03:53.733
Yeah, man, that one!

03:55.067 --> 03:57.737
Rooster, I'd love to help you,
but I can't.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.825
But you're the one who hired me there.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.077
I mean, they're obviously
gonna listen to you.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.373
Rooster, you tried to expense a night
at a strip club.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.543
That was a team-building exercise!

04:11.626 --> 04:12.835
[scoffs]

04:13.461 --> 04:15.129
Rooster, you know
I think the world of you,

04:15.212 --> 04:16.923
but there's nothing I can do.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.469
[sighs]

04:23.430 --> 04:25.265
All right, I understand.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.018
You'll land on your feet.

04:31.187 --> 04:35.317
Yes, I will. All right.
[sniffs] Thanks, Ed.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.946
I'm gonna need these.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.536
[vehicle approaching]

04:54.627 --> 04:55.670
[vehicle door opens]

04:55.753 --> 04:57.254
[chuckles]

04:58.381 --> 05:00.675
-Hey, Beau. How are you?
-Hey, Joanne.

05:00.758 --> 05:03.260
Good. It's good to see you.
What brings you by?

05:03.345 --> 05:04.804
Well, I'm on my way back from the airport

05:04.887 --> 05:06.973
and I thought I'd bring back
your binoculars

05:07.056 --> 05:09.601
'cause I know they're like
a third son to you.

05:09.684 --> 05:10.810
Third?

05:10.893 --> 05:14.105
If the house was on fire,
this is the son I'd carry out.

05:15.272 --> 05:18.150
-How was your Disney cruise?
-Oh, it was great.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.863
They have a waterslide and five pools.
[chuckles]

05:21.946 --> 05:24.366
And every night,
they seat you at a different table

05:24.449 --> 05:26.409
so you get to meet
all kinds of new people.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.579
And your reward
at the end of this rainbow of fun

05:29.662 --> 05:31.373
is being dropped off in Mexico?

05:31.456 --> 05:32.874
[chuckles]

05:33.958 --> 05:36.836
And... brought you a little gift.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.090
Mickey Mouse ears with "Grumpy" on it!

05:42.008 --> 05:44.677
-Grumpy? I don't get it.
-[scoffs]

05:45.553 --> 05:47.930
I tried to get them
to make me one for Colt,

05:48.014 --> 05:50.642
-but they wouldn't put "Shithead" on it.
-[chuckles]

05:51.518 --> 05:53.770
Hey, the storm's settling in.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.313
You're welcome to come in for a drink
till it lets up.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.983
If I come in, I'm gonna talk to you.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.610
That's fine.

06:01.318 --> 06:03.863
-I'm all ears.
-[laughs]

06:09.452 --> 06:11.954
Is it much further?
'Cause it's really starting to come down.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.122
Yeah, we'll be fine.

06:13.205 --> 06:16.000
We have four-wheel drive, tire chains...

06:16.083 --> 06:17.752
one of our seat belts works.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.211
[chuckles]

06:19.295 --> 06:20.547
Well, I packed a bag

06:20.630 --> 06:22.965
so hopefully,
we're staying at a hotel somewhere.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.884
I didn't say it was a hotel.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.636
Well, it fucking better be!

06:26.719 --> 06:28.262
Well, it fucking better is! [chuckles]

06:28.345 --> 06:29.514
[chuckles] Oh, my God.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.016
Wait, is it that new hotel and spa
in Aspen?

06:32.099 --> 06:34.561
Linda wanted to have her wedding there
but she couldn't afford it.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.228
Suck it, Linda!

06:37.104 --> 06:38.773
No, it's not that.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.401
I was gonna wait till we got there,
but here, grab the wheel.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.571
Colt, what the hell?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.824
[grunts] Ah, ta-da! [chuckles]

06:47.907 --> 06:49.826
[chuckles] Champagne!

06:49.909 --> 06:52.912
Yeah, it's your birthday and I know
how much you love champagne.

06:52.995 --> 06:56.749
"Dear Abby,
don't let Colt tell you this is from him.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.250
Happy birthday. Maggie."

06:59.168 --> 07:01.921
[clicks tongue] Probably should have
read that first, huh?

07:02.004 --> 07:04.215
-[chuckles]
-That's not the important part.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.092
-Open the envelope.
-All right.

07:08.052 --> 07:08.886
[chuckles]

07:08.970 --> 07:10.847
-Are you kidding me?
-[laughs]

07:10.930 --> 07:12.849
-Garth fucking Brooks?
-Yeah!

07:12.932 --> 07:14.726
-Oh, my God, I love you so much!
-[laughs]

07:14.809 --> 07:15.852
-All right, whoa!
-Yes!

07:15.935 --> 07:17.186
That's a little too much love.

07:17.269 --> 07:19.856
[both laugh]

07:19.939 --> 07:23.860
This is the best birthday gift ever.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.738
-Thank you. [gasps]
-Yeah.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.405
You've put up with a lot lately

07:28.490 --> 07:30.908
so I wanted to do
something special for you.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.620
I called in a little favor
and got a couple tickets.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.956
Oh, uh, if anybody asks,
you've got two weeks to live.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.088
[grunts]

07:44.589 --> 07:47.299
-Hey.
-Oh, my God!

07:47.383 --> 07:49.343
Must be two feet of snow
out there already.

07:49.426 --> 07:50.512
[sighs]

07:50.595 --> 07:53.848
Had to tie my bra to the antenna
so I could find my car in the morning.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.268
Smart.

07:57.935 --> 07:58.978
Oh, hold on.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.856
I just told you I wasn't wearing a bra,
you didn't ask to motorboat me?

08:01.939 --> 08:03.733
[chuckles] You feeling okay?

08:03.816 --> 08:06.486
[sighs] Just a long, shit day.

08:07.319 --> 08:10.447
Sorry. To you and your boobs.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.826
What's going on?

08:16.704 --> 08:17.872
[clears throat]

08:20.166 --> 08:23.836
-I got fired.
-What? Seriously?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.337
Is this because you were in jail?

08:26.172 --> 08:29.634
Honey, everybody goes to jail.
They can't fire you for that.

08:29.717 --> 08:32.804
Shit, I would've been fired
three, four times this year already.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.723
What happened?

08:38.392 --> 08:41.604
Just don't want to play
their stupid corporate games, you know?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.440
Don't matter.
I'll find something better.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.942
No, I know you will.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.359
You wanna talk about it?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.947
Not much to talk about.
Did I mention I got fired?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.949
There you go, you're up to date.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.283
Have you told your family?

08:55.660 --> 08:57.119
I just said
I didn't want to talk about it.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.955
Honey, I'm just trying to help you.

08:59.038 --> 09:03.167
-Well, I don't need your help.
-Oh, yeah, no, you're right.

09:03.250 --> 09:06.087
Unemployed guy
living in his mom's hunting cabin,

09:06.170 --> 09:09.215
eating a dented can of spaghetti rings.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.050
No, you don't need my help. Nope.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.388
First of all, I dented that myself, okay?
You save 25 cents.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.975
Secondly, I'm doing fine.

09:21.268 --> 09:24.606
Well, I could... I could put in
a word for you at the Cracker Barrel.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.315
[snorts] Okay.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.360
What the fuck does that mean?

09:30.194 --> 09:31.904
I'm not gonna work at the Cracker Barrel.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.199
Oh, why? 'Cause why,
you're too good for the Cracker Barrel?

09:35.950 --> 09:38.870
Well, how do I put this? Um, yeah.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.831
Oh, but it's okay for me?

09:41.914 --> 09:44.917
No. Yeah. I don't know.
You like it there.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.755
Oh, yeah. You know what else I like?
I like having a job, Rooster.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.506
Go fuck yourself.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.967
-[glass shatters]
-[screams] Shit!

09:53.676 --> 09:54.969
[Rooster] Holy shit!

09:55.052 --> 09:58.681
Oh, my God!
That scared the crap out of me.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.224
My God, this is the last thing I need.

10:00.307 --> 10:02.226
Jesus! Fucking... It's freezing!

10:02.309 --> 10:03.519
[Rooster grunts]

10:07.940 --> 10:09.441
Okay, guys... [sighs]

10:09.525 --> 10:13.237
I think I'm gonna have to shut it down
'cause of the storm, so this is last call.

10:13.320 --> 10:16.282
So it's time we get you home.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.575
I don't know what I'd do without you.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.161
Aw, that's sweet.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.871
He was talking to the beer.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.795
We're closing up, so, anything else?

10:30.004 --> 10:32.423
Uh... a club soda and lime, please.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.634
Trying to sober up?

10:34.717 --> 10:38.137
-For the last 15 years and four months.
-Oh.

10:38.220 --> 10:41.390
-Yeah, I'm one of those.
-Hey, no judgment from me.

10:41.473 --> 10:44.226
I got two sons who are in denial
about being those.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.314
I like your dream catcher.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.109
-What?
-Your dream catcher.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.195
Wow.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.115
I put that here
the day I took over this bar.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.993
You're the first person
who's ever noticed it.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.037
Well, most people are
probably looking at the booze

11:03.120 --> 11:04.371
and I'm trying to look anywhere else.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.750
Doesn't look like something
you picked up at the ampm.

11:08.375 --> 11:09.460
No.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.004
My grandmother gave it to me
when I was a kid.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.298
She was quarter Chippewa.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.175
No kidding.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.802
-My grandfather was half Cherokee.
-Hmm.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.930
But all he ever gave me
was a predisposition for high cholesterol.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.306
[chuckles]

11:23.182 --> 11:24.308
I'm Maggie.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.394
Clint. It's nice to meet you.

11:28.270 --> 11:32.399
You must be Maggie of the sign outside.
Although, currently it says "aggie's."

11:32.483 --> 11:34.568
Ah, yeah,
you should have been here the time

11:34.651 --> 11:37.196
I lost the "tails"
out of my "cocktails" sign.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.491
-Wow, that must've been fun.
-Oh, yeah.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.326
Whole new clientele that week.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.872
Anyway, it's none of my business, but...

11:45.955 --> 11:48.665
your friend seemed
pretty pissed off earlier.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.334
Yeah. Well... [sighs]

11:51.002 --> 11:52.879
-I'm a musician--
-Oh, got it.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.673
You think your friend is coming back?

11:57.716 --> 12:00.427
Nope. She just sent me a video of her

12:00.511 --> 12:03.014
throwing all my clothes
out her car window.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.891
You never really know
how much denim you wear

12:04.974 --> 12:07.434
until you see it spread out all along
the side of a highway.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.188
So, she didn't leave you,
she did you a favor.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.777
I don't blame her.
Life on the road's not for everyone.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.279
Waking up every morning in a new city.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.032
Everyone you meet is a stranger.
You never get to see your family.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.784
I'm waiting for the bad part.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.453
So, a musician...
You any good?

12:26.537 --> 12:27.663
[inhales deeply]

12:27.746 --> 12:31.042
Well, the  Barstow Daily News
once called me

12:31.125 --> 12:33.878
"Surprisingly decent
before he fell off the stage."

12:33.961 --> 12:35.587
-[chuckles]
-I'd play you something,

12:35.671 --> 12:38.507
but I think my guitar is in a snowbank
somewhere on the way to Denver.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.094
Yeah, well, how about this?
You could use that one.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.763
If you play me something
while I'm closing up,

12:44.847 --> 12:47.599
all your soda waters are on the house.

12:47.683 --> 12:50.769
Good, 'cause my wallet's in my ex's car.

12:50.853 --> 12:54.690
[sighs] Okay,
but any tips you get, we split.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.406
Is that a guitar?

13:03.490 --> 13:06.410
I don't know... and I don't care.

13:06.493 --> 13:08.745
We haven't moved in, like, an hour.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.790
I've been staring at the same
stupid billboard the whole time.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.960
-It ain't been that long.
-Oh, no?

13:14.043 --> 13:16.587
"Accidentes autovilisticos?

13:16.670 --> 13:17.922
Consulta gratis.

13:18.005 --> 13:23.052
Telefonear ocho-ocho-ocho,
ocho-ocho-ocho, ocho-ocho-seis."

13:25.762 --> 13:28.432
Idiots. Put the question mark upside-down.
[scoffs]

13:31.227 --> 13:32.937
We'll be there soon.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.772
Before you know it, we'll be arm-in-arm
with complete strangers

13:35.857 --> 13:37.942
singing "Friends in Low Places."
[chuckles]

13:38.025 --> 13:40.069
Drinking our $14 Bud Lights.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.363
And the $14 Bud Lights
of the guys next to us.

13:42.446 --> 13:46.742
[stuttering] "Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought those were ours. We..."

13:46.825 --> 13:49.328
"It's all good, man.
Garth Brooks. Woo-hoo!"

13:51.205 --> 13:53.749
Waze says it's gonna take
six hours to get to Denver.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.501
Waze changes all the time.

13:55.584 --> 13:56.878
[cell phone chimes]

13:56.961 --> 13:59.005
Yup. Now it says seven hours.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.258
We'll take a different route.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.887
[sighs]
The traffic is backed up both ways.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.725
We're not gonna make the concert.
Let's just pull off.

14:11.808 --> 14:13.102
What? No.

14:13.185 --> 14:16.730
Well, look, there's a Duke's Smokehouse
like a half a mile from here.

14:16.813 --> 14:20.526
Johnny G. on Yelp says "I've had worse."

14:20.609 --> 14:23.112
No. We're not giving up!

14:23.195 --> 14:24.571
We're going to this concert.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.616
We're gonna buy a $40 ill-fitting T-shirt
that we're never gonna wear.

14:27.699 --> 14:29.118
We're gonna have fucking fun.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.751
Best birthday ever.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.461
Oh, that really helps.

14:39.545 --> 14:43.215
I'm sorry, I love being stuck
in this snowstorm in this fucking truck.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.051
Garth Brooks! Whoo-hoo!

14:52.224 --> 14:53.392
Really?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.104
What?

14:57.188 --> 14:58.480
You're gonna do that in here?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.107
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.775
Maybe that huge
wad of tobacco in your mouth

15:01.858 --> 15:04.236
that makes you spit
every ten seconds got in the way.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.827
You really need to spit, don't you?

15:13.329 --> 15:15.039
[gulps] Nope.

15:16.873 --> 15:20.252
Wow. You somehow made it more disgusting.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.754
Well, at least I ain't gotta
breathe it in. [coughing]

15:22.838 --> 15:25.632
Mmm-hmm. Stop it!

15:26.926 --> 15:29.178
-I'm blowin' it out the window!
-[window opening]

15:29.720 --> 15:31.847
Roll your window up, Colt!

15:32.514 --> 15:33.765
-Put out your cigarette out.
-My God.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.851
You're making me miserable on my birthday.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.728
No, you're making you miserable
on your birthday.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.563
-You're giving me fucking emphysema!
-[groans]

15:42.441 --> 15:43.442
Thank you.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.945
-Yeah, you're welcome.
-[window closing]

15:49.031 --> 15:50.282
[coughs]

15:54.453 --> 15:55.579
[Colt groans]

15:55.662 --> 15:57.289
All right, fine.
How far is the restaurant?

15:57.999 --> 16:00.001
It's right there. You can see the sign.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.545
-Waze says we'll be there in...
-[cell phone chimes]

16:03.629 --> 16:04.964
45 minutes.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.384
[guitar playing]

16:08.467 --> 16:10.511
[Clint singing]
♪ But I ain't lonely, babe ♪

16:11.637 --> 16:14.056
♪ I ain't lonely, baby ♪

16:14.974 --> 16:18.144
♪ I ain't lonely, babe ♪

16:18.810 --> 16:20.229
♪ Tonight ♪

16:22.731 --> 16:25.192
All right, I only have one question.

16:25.901 --> 16:29.113
-Why the hell aren't you famous?
-[chuckles]

16:29.196 --> 16:31.490
Came in second on  Star Search  one year.

16:31.573 --> 16:35.202
Would have come in first but...
Ooh! Twelve-year-old can juggle.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.914
I had my chance.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.500
I got a record deal,
went on tour with Willie Nelson.

16:41.583 --> 16:45.004
-Wow, really? That sounds incredible.
-It was.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.007
Until Willie kicked me off
for doing too many drugs.

16:49.050 --> 16:52.344
Yeah, when Willie Nelson says "slow down,"
that should tell you something.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.682
Yeah, I burned a few bridges.

16:56.765 --> 17:00.394
And a couple of motel rooms.
And one recording studio.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.938
Who leaves a drunk man alone
in a room with a lava lamp?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.065
[Maggie chuckles]

17:04.148 --> 17:06.650
I almost burned down my dorm room
at college.

17:07.318 --> 17:10.737
Actually,
I fell asleep while holding a joint...

17:10.821 --> 17:12.739
but I was staring right at a lava lamp.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.993
Weed and lava lamps,
that was the Ambien of the '70s.

17:18.204 --> 17:22.416
Anyway... now I'm perfectly happy
with club soda and a life on the road.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.544
So what's your favorite place you've been?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.129
[inhales deeply]

17:27.213 --> 17:30.424
Well, I'd say either Paris, France,
or Elko, Nevada.

17:31.007 --> 17:32.008
Really?

17:32.093 --> 17:35.471
Yeah, there's a little diner there
that serves great enchiladas.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.681
-Elko's nice too.
-[both chuckle]

17:38.724 --> 17:42.394
Elko's actually the first place I ever
got the courage to get on stage sober.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.189
I needed to play more than
I needed the booze.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.191
I traded one addiction for another,
I guess.

17:47.274 --> 17:51.112
Yeah. Uh, when I quit smoking,
I started collecting Beanie Babies.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.574
So, what's your story?

17:55.657 --> 17:58.034
I grew up in Scottsbluff, Nebraska.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.871
Yeah, my father worked
in the sugar factory there.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.249
He always called it "a pretty sweet job."

18:03.915 --> 18:06.627
He wasn't funny, but he was a good dad.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.504
And then I went
to the University of Nebraska.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.591
-What'd you major in, corn?
-Oh, look, you're not funny either.

18:14.135 --> 18:17.012
Well, then between
my sophomore and junior year,

18:17.096 --> 18:19.640
I decided it'd be fun
to hitchhike across the country.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.725
I wanted to visit every state.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.311
But I only made it to one.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.273
I met this cowboy named Beau...

18:28.064 --> 18:29.941
and I spent the best summer
of my life there.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.236
He taught me how to ranch and shoot guns.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.905
I taught him how to dance
and shoot tequila. [chuckles]

18:36.282 --> 18:38.700
-You know what they say about tequila.
-What?

18:38.784 --> 18:40.536
I can't remember. Too much tequila.

18:42.078 --> 18:45.081
-So how'd you end up here?
-Finished college...

18:46.082 --> 18:51.547
and then I married that cowboy,
had a couple of boys, bought this bar...

18:52.464 --> 18:55.634
divorced that cowboy,
now I'm trying to sell the bar.

18:56.302 --> 19:00.013
Hey, you wouldn't wanna add a bar to the
list of things you burned down, would you?

19:00.597 --> 19:03.350
That's cute, you think
I haven't burned down a bar.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.478
Why don't I play you another song?
What's your favorite?

19:07.771 --> 19:10.441
"Angel from Montgomery" by John Prine.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.108
Well, you got good taste.

19:12.984 --> 19:14.820
I could talk to you all night long.

19:16.071 --> 19:19.200
-You don't have a place to stay, do you?
-No, I do not.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.120
Well, if you wanna crash in the bar,

19:24.205 --> 19:26.498
I got some spare blankets
out in my Airstream.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.833
Really? You don't mind?

19:27.916 --> 19:30.669
No. It's the least I could do
for a free concert.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.171
I appreciate this, Maggie.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.632
Yeah... it's my pleasure.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.968
You're an interesting guy, Clint.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.389
Hey, if you hear a weird noise
in the night,

19:42.473 --> 19:45.434
it's either a raccoon
trying to get in the Dumpster

19:45.517 --> 19:47.603
or Hank trying to get back in the bar.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.564
Either way, just shine a light
in their eyes, they'll run off.

19:56.152 --> 19:57.446
[Joanne chuckles]

19:57.529 --> 19:59.698
So, it's day two of my cruise

19:59.781 --> 20:02.409
and my granddaughter has not looked up
from her phone once.

20:03.034 --> 20:05.329
What is she even doing on that thing?

20:05.412 --> 20:07.248
-She's six!
-Jesus.

20:07.331 --> 20:12.168
So, I said, "Honey.
Honey, look, there's Elsa from  Frozen!"

20:12.253 --> 20:16.215
And she turned to look, and I grabbed
her cell phone and I threw it overboard.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.967
And after that, we had the best time.
[laughs]

20:19.718 --> 20:22.012
Unfortunately, it was her mom's phone.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.847
-[Beau grunts]
-[chuckles]

20:24.806 --> 20:26.558
I hate cell phones.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.061
I liked it better when if you needed
to get a hold of somebody,

20:29.144 --> 20:30.395
you just shot up a flare.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.440
[chuckles]
Okay, enough about me and my trip.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.985
This always happens. I come over here
and I hog the conversation.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.362
You tell a story, Beau.

20:39.530 --> 20:43.199
Okay. [inhales deeply] Uh, let's see...

20:44.868 --> 20:47.829
I was at the feedstore the other day
to get some baling twine.

20:48.830 --> 20:52.251
They always keep it on aisle three,
'bout chest high...

20:53.168 --> 20:54.670
but it wasn't there.

20:55.296 --> 20:58.089
So I go up to the counter and ask Glenn.

20:58.173 --> 21:01.927
He says, "We're out.
We'll have some more on Tuesday."

21:03.887 --> 21:06.097
So I gotta go back on Tuesday.

21:09.100 --> 21:12.896
Wow, I got to call you on Wednesday
so I can get the thrilling conclusion.

21:12.979 --> 21:14.398
[chuckles]

21:16.608 --> 21:19.403
Man, this storm is not letting up.

21:21.112 --> 21:22.197
Mmm.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.701
Well, I guess
we'll just have to keep drinkin'.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.329
Mmm. I knew I liked you.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.084
-I'm glad you came over, Joanne.
-Me too.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.086
I missed you, Beau.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.005
All right, you did it. You ruined it.

21:48.599 --> 21:49.933
[knocking at door]

21:52.519 --> 21:54.855
-I gotta get that.
-Mmm.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.232
[Beau sighs]

22:00.235 --> 22:03.071
If that’s one of my boys, I'm gonna kill him.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.700
Hey, Beau. Sorry to bother you.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.909
-Can I come in?
-Sure.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.119
-Mary?
-[Mary exhales]

22:09.202 --> 22:10.746
Hey, Joanne, what are you doing here?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.915
Oh, my God.

22:13.999 --> 22:19.129
No, it's not like that. We're...
I just came to return his binoculars.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.923
Oh, is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

22:22.674 --> 22:25.093
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry if I interrupted something,

22:25.176 --> 22:28.805
but, um, I just went over to Rooster's...
to return his binoculars...

22:29.890 --> 22:31.808
and, um, we got in this big fight,

22:31.892 --> 22:35.103
and then a tree came crashing through
the window and knocked the power out.

22:35.186 --> 22:37.230
-What?
-Are you okay?

22:37.313 --> 22:39.190
-Where's... where's Rooster?
-No, I'm fine.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.985
But he is over there, sitting in the dark,
freezing his balls off

22:42.068 --> 22:44.029
'cause he doesn't think
he's welcome here with you.

22:44.112 --> 22:45.989
He's smarter than I thought.

22:47.073 --> 22:48.450
Go get him, Beau.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.453
If he gets cold enough,
he'll shoot up a flare.

22:53.329 --> 22:54.330
Please.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.377
-Fine.
-Thank you.

23:01.838 --> 23:05.341
Oh, and it's, uh... it's cold out there,
so don't forget your hat.

23:07.594 --> 23:10.180
This is not how I want to be found dead.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.598
[chuckles]

23:13.600 --> 23:14.976
[guitar playing]

23:16.645 --> 23:18.439
[indistinct chatter]

23:22.025 --> 23:24.945
Should've read the rest
of Johnny G.'s Yelp review.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.071
"I've had worse,

23:26.154 --> 23:27.739
but only in prison."

23:30.492 --> 23:32.285
-[Abby sighs]
-I'm sorry.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.331
Nah, it's all right. Fries aren't bad.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.999
No, it's nine o'clock.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.919
We should be sitting front row
at Garth Brooks right now,

23:41.002 --> 23:42.420
listening to him sing "The Storm."

23:42.504 --> 23:45.466
Front row? I saw the tickets, Colt.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.593
Front row of the balcony.
That's even better.

23:47.676 --> 23:48.677
You gotta puke,

23:48.760 --> 23:51.513
[stutters] it's only a problem
for the rich guy sittin' below you.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.975
I'm bummed out too,
but it's not your fault we got stuck.

23:59.771 --> 24:03.233
-Are you gonna leave me?
-What? What are you talking about?

24:07.738 --> 24:09.865
It's always somethin' with us.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.075
[stammers] You and Kenny, right?
Me and Heather.

24:12.158 --> 24:13.869
Your parents hatin' me.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.538
[stammers] A blizzard on your birthday.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.915
Not the good kind with Oreos.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.293
[chuckles]
Okay, where is this coming from?

24:23.837 --> 24:25.130
I don't know.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.843
I'm afraid one day
you're gonna wake up

24:29.926 --> 24:31.553
and be like, "Why am I with Colt Bennett?"

24:31.637 --> 24:33.471
I wake up like that every day.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.141
I'm serious.

24:38.476 --> 24:39.477
Why are you with me?

24:40.979 --> 24:41.980
Really?

24:45.609 --> 24:50.238
Colt... you're the sweetest,
most romantic person I've ever met.

24:50.321 --> 24:53.742
Hey, do you know what Kenny did
for my birthday every year?

24:53.825 --> 24:57.162
We'd go to Applebee's and get two
appetizers, two entrées and two desserts.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.455
Say what you want,
but the Two-Two-Two for $22?

24:59.540 --> 25:01.207
-That's just a good deal.
-[Abby chuckles]

25:02.500 --> 25:04.419
You always surprise me.

25:05.128 --> 25:07.673
You wrote "Colt Loves Abby"
on the water tower.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.467
Okay, you...
you hide McGriddles in my desk at school

25:11.552 --> 25:13.136
so I can find them in the morning.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.181
Sure, sometimes I don't check my desk
for a week or two

25:16.264 --> 25:18.600
and the janitor has to get rid of it
with gloves...

25:21.812 --> 25:23.647
but I appreciate the gesture.

25:25.356 --> 25:27.233
You make life exciting.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.946
Why can't we have fun?

25:32.864 --> 25:34.908
Remember how easy it used to be?

25:34.991 --> 25:37.619
We'd just, like,
ditch school and go tubin'.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.580
Or ditch school and go fishing.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.582
-[chuckles]
-Or ditch school and go...

25:41.665 --> 25:43.959
-How'd I graduate?
-I did all your homework.

25:44.835 --> 25:47.378
We were 17. It's different now.

25:47.462 --> 25:50.173
We're older. We have responsibilities.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.342
[sighs heavily]

25:52.425 --> 25:54.260
That doesn't mean we still can't have fun.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.346
That's another thing I love about you,

25:56.429 --> 25:59.557
you're the most fun person
I have ever met.

25:59.641 --> 26:03.103
I think what you mean is
I'm the "funnest" person you've ever met.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.646
[chuckles] You see?

26:04.730 --> 26:08.233
Your whimsical disregard
for the rules of grammar amuses me.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.236
It's all how you look at things.

26:11.319 --> 26:15.115
There is nothing stopping us
from being happy right this second.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.826
-You're saying get drunk?
-Yes, I am.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.880
You should've trimmed those trees
last fall when I told you to.

26:29.963 --> 26:33.884
[Rooster] Yeah.
It's not Mother Nature's fault, it's mine.

26:35.593 --> 26:36.887
[hammer clatters]

26:36.970 --> 26:38.054
What you doing here?

26:39.347 --> 26:41.767
You can come down
and stay at the house tonight if you want.

26:42.558 --> 26:43.769
No, thanks. I'm fine.

26:44.936 --> 26:48.189
-All right. I tried.
-Good to see you too, Dad. [sighs]

26:49.524 --> 26:52.193
-[sniffs]
-Things okay over at your ranch?

26:52.277 --> 26:54.655
You get your calves in before the storm?

26:55.196 --> 26:58.533
Yeah. I tucked 'em in,
read 'em a nursery rhyme.

26:59.534 --> 27:02.162
I don't do that one about the cow
jumping over the moon, though.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.122
You know, I don't want
to give 'em any ideas.

27:05.581 --> 27:08.001
You got someone there
to break the ice off the tanks?

27:08.084 --> 27:09.419
Jesus, Dad.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.259
Well, you're gonna hear about it anyway.
I got fired.

27:18.344 --> 27:21.431
-What did you do?
-What makes you think it's my fault?

27:22.307 --> 27:25.060
Well, I bailed you out of jail,
now you're fired?

27:30.356 --> 27:33.109
Just got... They got all these rules,
you know, and paperwork.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.320
Make it so fucking complicated.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.864
I mean, ranching is not rocket science.

27:37.948 --> 27:41.492
Birth a cow, raise a cow, kill a cow.
Repeat.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.706
You shouldn't have left here
before you were ready.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.541
Yeah, you told me a million times.

27:50.418 --> 27:51.837
It's called parenting.

27:52.545 --> 27:58.218
Birth a son, raise a son,
tell a son when he's wrong. Repeat.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.136
[scoffs] Whatever.

28:01.387 --> 28:05.516
So what are you gonna do?
You gonna come back here and work?

28:06.685 --> 28:08.561
I'm gonna come back here
and be your number two?

28:08.644 --> 28:12.440
Technically, it's number three.
Colt got bumped up when you left.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.734
That's what I need, Dad,

28:14.818 --> 28:16.945
come back here and have you
tell me how to run a ranch.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.781
If you knew how,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

28:20.907 --> 28:22.909
Then maybe we should stop
having this conversation.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.455
It's fine by me.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.088
[door closes]

28:39.050 --> 28:41.594
Found one of my boys' sleeping bags.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.348
Hello?

28:48.184 --> 28:49.435
Shit.

28:50.311 --> 28:52.480
Are you kidding me?

28:53.648 --> 28:54.649
[sighs]

28:57.277 --> 28:58.694
[indistinct chatter]

29:03.574 --> 29:05.201
-You having fun yet?
-Oh, yeah.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.494
[Abby chuckles]

29:06.577 --> 29:10.540
Guy in the urinal next to me pissed all
over my boots. I'm having a great time.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.668
[singer] Got a special request
for this next song.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.046
This one goes out to Colt Bennett.

29:17.047 --> 29:20.133
[chuckles] Well, that's funny.
There must be two Colt Bennetts here.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.802
