REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANTS, WHICH

01:42.770 --> 01:44.397

03:12.760 --> 03:14.250
SLICING A BAGEL.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.579

07:31.010 --> 07:32.079
EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE,

07:32.080 --> 07:34.548

07:36.520 --> 07:37.885
HE KNOWS IT ALL, BUT IN FACT, HE

07:37.890 --> 07:39.141
DOESN'T KNOW SHIT.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.879
Sean: YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST TO

07:50.130 --> 07:52.598
WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO HER VAGINA.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.034
IT LOOKS TOO GENERIC TO ME. I'D

07:55.040 --> 07:56.962
LIKE IT TO BE APPEALING AND

07:56.970 --> 07:59.632
PRETTY. THE FOLDS ARE TOO

08:23.270 --> 08:24.999
Kimber: I GOT REAL, CHRISTIAN.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.797
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. I REALIZED

08:26.800 --> 08:28.563
IT WASN'T MY TALENT FOR PLAYING

08:28.570 --> 08:29.332
A CHARACTER THAT PEOPLE

08:29.340 --> 08:32.059
RESPONDED TO. IT'S MY RAW,

08:32.070 --> 08:34.777
SIMMERING SENSUALITY.
