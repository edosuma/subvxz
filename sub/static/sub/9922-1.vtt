WEBVTT

01:15.618 --> 01:16.870
What do you want?

01:17.912 --> 01:21.291
I want to know if a woman
will succeed to
the kingdom of Kattegat.

01:21.666 --> 01:24.169
You mean after
the death of Ragnar?

01:26.504 --> 01:27.630
Yes.

01:59.162 --> 02:02.707
It is unwise to
imagine the death of kings.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.919
I still ask you.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.547
Yes, I have seen it.

02:10.673 --> 02:14.719
A woman will one
day rule in Kattegat.

02:16.012 --> 02:17.430
Will it be me?

02:40.912 --> 02:42.872
You know the truth
but you will not say.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.044
I have already said enough.

02:56.094 --> 02:57.220
No.

02:58.096 --> 02:59.264
No!

03:42.181 --> 03:44.350
<i>The gods are here.</i>

03:47.353 --> 03:49.230
They're watching.

04:46.084 --> 04:51.584
- <i><font color="#ffffff"> Synced and corrected by</font></i> <b> <i><font color="#ffd700"> mrcjnthn </font> </i> </b> -

05:07.684 --> 05:08.726
Is it fun, Ivar?

05:09.018 --> 05:10.269
Out of the way!

05:10.353 --> 05:12.730
Be careful not
to break my bones!

05:13.231 --> 05:14.357
Out of the way!

05:18.736 --> 05:20.154
Do you want to go again?

05:20.238 --> 05:21.739
Faster! Faster!

05:21.948 --> 05:23.574
Now, where are
the little boys?

05:23.783 --> 05:24.993
Bjorn! Bjorn! Bjorn!

05:26.285 --> 05:27.412
Come here!

05:27.662 --> 05:30.039
Let me see.

05:30.790 --> 05:33.793
Ubbe. Hvitserk.
Sigurd. Ivar.

05:34.085 --> 05:35.128
Ivar!

05:36.587 --> 05:38.756
Ah, you are all so big.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.010
Queen Aslaug.

06:03.698 --> 06:05.825
I have carved
these runes for you.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.633
They will help
to heal you.

06:23.676 --> 06:24.844
I swear it.

06:40.276 --> 06:41.444
Thank you.

06:49.702 --> 06:50.953
Tell me,

06:52.079 --> 06:53.247
why did Porunn leave?

06:54.040 --> 06:56.209
Nobody knows.
She just disappeared
one night.

06:58.002 --> 06:59.837
It seems a long
time ago now.

07:02.924 --> 07:04.717
She left behind
your daughter.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.614
Don't worry,
we will take
care of her.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.270
And something
for you, Ivar.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.480
What is that?

08:03.985 --> 08:07.071
So, Paris was
everything Athelstan
said it would be.

08:08.322 --> 08:11.075
Yes, and everything
Ragnar dreamed.

08:11.284 --> 08:12.493
And more beside.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.423
Today we grieve for our dead,

08:26.090 --> 08:28.843
but we should all be proud
of what we have achieved!

08:28.926 --> 08:30.052
Aye!

08:30.136 --> 08:32.597
This is a lock from
the gates of Paris!

08:32.679 --> 08:33.890
Whoa!

08:33.972 --> 08:35.515
I hacked it off myself.

08:37.684 --> 08:41.606
Paris has made us all rich!

08:43.774 --> 08:46.193
<i>But to be rich
only means one thing!</i>

08:46.777 --> 08:49.071
<i>To satisfy our dreams.</i>

08:50.197 --> 08:52.116
Nothing can stop us!

08:54.285 --> 08:56.287
Now, Ragnar is
dangerously ill.

08:58.122 --> 08:59.749
It is true he may die.

09:02.418 --> 09:04.086
But who is your king?

09:04.170 --> 09:05.796
Ragnar!

09:05.880 --> 09:08.215
And to whom do we
owe our allegiance?

09:08.299 --> 09:09.634
Ragnar!

09:09.717 --> 09:12.428
And to whom do we
owe our gratitude?

09:12.511 --> 09:14.639
Ragnar!

09:15.222 --> 09:18.059
<i>Ragnar himself has
always shown his gratitude</i>

09:18.142 --> 09:20.937
<i>to those who have trusted
and believed in him.</i>

09:21.896 --> 09:24.982
For example,
his loyal friend,

09:25.608 --> 09:27.818
the English monk
Athelstan...

09:29.654 --> 09:31.822
Who helped him to
understand many things.

09:33.699 --> 09:36.535
Ragnar always
claimed we went to Paris

09:36.619 --> 09:38.663
because of Athelstan!

09:41.415 --> 09:42.583
Therefore...

09:45.628 --> 09:48.255
I order the arrest of Floki
for the murder of Athelstan.

09:51.926 --> 09:53.135
No, no, Floki, don't!

10:02.311 --> 10:05.690
What I did,
I did for the common good,

10:06.691 --> 10:08.401
for the sake of all of us!

10:11.529 --> 10:13.447
I have nothing to answer for.

10:18.369 --> 10:19.870
Don't you remember, Bjorn?

10:20.246 --> 10:22.873
How we talked about
that Christian priest,

10:23.541 --> 10:26.627
and how you also feared
his influence on your father?

10:28.212 --> 10:29.422
Why don't you admit it?

10:31.841 --> 10:32.925
Admit it!

10:52.278 --> 10:53.821
Are you going
back to Hedeby?

10:54.405 --> 10:56.240
Yes. I leave tomorrow.

10:56.741 --> 10:58.409
There is much to do.
Of course.

10:59.118 --> 11:00.745
But remember we plan
to raid Paris again,

11:00.828 --> 11:02.288
after we've
replenished
our forces.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.623
I can't wait,
Bjorn Ironside.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.921
You spoke well today.
I'm proud of you.

11:11.922 --> 11:12.923
Someone had to.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.095
And please,
Bjorn, let me know if...

11:20.097 --> 11:21.599
If Ragnar lives or dies.

11:43.454 --> 11:44.955
It's Lagertha!

11:45.164 --> 11:47.166
We are home!

11:48.084 --> 11:49.752
- I want to see him!
- Where is he?

11:49.835 --> 11:51.087
Quickly!

11:52.463 --> 11:53.464
She's here.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.594
- Einar!
- Earl Kalf.

11:58.677 --> 11:59.720
My friend.

12:04.725 --> 12:05.726
It's for you.

12:05.810 --> 12:06.852
You see?

12:08.312 --> 12:11.398
Erlendur,
son of King Horik.

12:13.234 --> 12:14.777
So, what is this?

12:15.986 --> 12:17.363
This is a Frankish weapon.

12:17.446 --> 12:18.823
They call it a crossbow.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.700
I think it will
prove to be very useful.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.370
Perhaps.

12:24.954 --> 12:26.497
But not as useful as this.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.333
You should bury that.
Hoard it.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.127
Save it for when
you're dead.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.170
I can't wait that long.

12:33.587 --> 12:34.880
Good folk of Hedeby.

12:36.507 --> 12:38.342
See what we have
brought back from Paris.

12:39.009 --> 12:42.179
Not just me,
but also Lagertha.

12:50.855 --> 12:53.774
During the fierce
fighting that took place

12:53.858 --> 12:55.943
along the walls and
the gates of Paris,

12:56.777 --> 13:00.114
about which the poets
will soon have their say,

13:00.197 --> 13:02.032
I saved Lagertha's life.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.450
- Yeah.
- Oh.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.202
And she saved mine.

13:06.704 --> 13:09.540
So I propose, even though
we are not married,

13:09.874 --> 13:12.126
Lagertha and I
will share the earldom

13:12.209 --> 13:14.420
and rule together as equals.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.843
As your Earl,
that is my determination.

13:39.278 --> 13:41.488
Please, stop it! Stop it!

13:44.074 --> 13:45.117
Leave him alone!

13:45.451 --> 13:47.620
Stop! Please, please!

13:48.078 --> 13:49.997
Stop it! Stop throwing!

13:50.122 --> 13:52.416
Leave him alone! Leave him!

13:53.500 --> 13:56.086
Leave him.
Stop it! Please, stop it.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.505
Stop it!

13:59.340 --> 14:00.674
Leave him alone.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.636
Get out of here!
Get out of here.
Oh!

14:13.771 --> 14:15.689
To shame me
like this, Bjorn,

14:16.857 --> 14:18.275
for defending
the gods.

14:47.972 --> 14:49.556
Come on, keep them moving.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.809
This way, this way.
Come, come, come, come!

14:54.561 --> 14:56.939
Gentlemen, do I have
something special
for you today.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.983
Please, come in.
See this, see this, see this.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.484
Look at this one here.
She'll give you

15:00.567 --> 15:02.111
a very special price
for this one, my friend.

15:02.194 --> 15:03.445
Huh? Yeah?

15:04.196 --> 15:06.532
Get back. Back, back, back.

15:06.615 --> 15:07.741
The Queen is coming!

15:07.825 --> 15:10.411
Back. The Queen!
The Queen is coming. Back!

15:19.295 --> 15:20.504
Who are these people?

15:20.796 --> 15:24.049
They are from Paris,
and they're for sale,
Queen Aslaug,

15:24.842 --> 15:26.677
for a very good price,
by the way.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.610
Father!

16:26.570 --> 16:28.447
How much you've grown,
little man.

16:30.741 --> 16:31.867
You're awake.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.995
Nothing gets
past you, Ubbe, huh?

16:36.455 --> 16:38.248
Are you well again?

16:38.791 --> 16:39.958
I'm alive...

16:43.379 --> 16:44.505
Unfortunately.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.800
Unfortunately?

16:54.306 --> 16:56.016
Do you want to
be king one day?

16:56.141 --> 16:57.267
Of course, Father.
Yes?

16:57.351 --> 16:58.435
Yes.
Yes?

16:58.769 --> 16:59.937
Then get me some ale.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.618
I'm going to
tell Mother!

17:22.917 --> 17:25.295
Mother! Father is awake.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.718
Well, don't you care?

17:33.846 --> 17:34.972
Of course I do.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.600
Go and tell everyone
that Ragnar the King lives!

17:49.653 --> 17:51.155
Hey, Angrboda.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.158
What have you
got there for me?

18:01.331 --> 18:02.541
Would you help me?

18:05.210 --> 18:07.129
Mmm. Thank you.

18:07.713 --> 18:09.006
Oh, that's so good.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.009
Ragnar is awake.

18:18.682 --> 18:21.602
Angrboda, go feed
the chickens over there.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.318
He will kill me.

18:32.696 --> 18:35.115
It was a mistake for
me to carve the runes.

18:35.824 --> 18:39.369
Why would I try to save him?
What's wrong with me?

18:42.623 --> 18:43.790
Helga...

18:45.959 --> 18:47.836
My beautiful,
faithful wife.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.506
Mother of my child.

18:51.715 --> 18:52.966
Helga...

18:54.468 --> 18:56.136
Please help me escape.

18:56.929 --> 18:58.055
Please.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.307
Help me, Helga!
Help me!

19:00.891 --> 19:01.642
Help...

19:22.329 --> 19:23.580
Ubbe.
What's that?

19:25.415 --> 19:26.541
I don't know.

19:28.377 --> 19:29.753
That looks like a road.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.422
And that a sea.

19:33.715 --> 19:34.758
Maybe.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.178
Where did
you find it?

19:39.096 --> 19:40.555
In a house in Paris.

19:43.517 --> 19:44.685
Whoever owned it
clearly thought

19:44.768 --> 19:47.062
it was more important
than anything else he had.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.439
He fought hard to save it.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.904
What's it to you, Bjorn?

19:58.949 --> 20:00.158
It's my destiny.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.996
How about
over here, Earl Kalf?

20:04.121 --> 20:05.289
Yes, it's good.

20:06.415 --> 20:07.624
I will.
Thank you.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.751
I will tell you a story...

20:09.835 --> 20:12.462
Einar. What can
I do for you?

20:13.171 --> 20:17.134
Your arrangement to share
the earldom with
Lagertha is unacceptable.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.303
To whom?

20:19.636 --> 20:21.138
To me and to my family.

20:21.847 --> 20:23.807
It was my family
who made you Earl.

20:24.975 --> 20:26.810
We can just as
easily unmake you.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.895
Why can't you
accept Lagertha?

20:29.479 --> 20:31.523
Because it was not
part of the agreement!

20:33.025 --> 20:34.901
You stated your
desire to overthrow

20:34.985 --> 20:37.487
all the Lothbrok dynasty
and we believed you.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.158
And so did Erlendur,
who is with us.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.453
Now it seems
without consultation
with anyone,

20:44.536 --> 20:45.871
you have changed
your mind!

20:48.707 --> 20:49.875
I understand.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.919
I didn't realize that
you and your family were

20:53.003 --> 20:55.839
quite so antagonistic
to the new arrangement.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.092
We don't care
what you do, Kalf.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.763
But we do look
forward to the removal
of that woman.

21:03.180 --> 21:06.141
That woman that you are
still in love with, Einar?

21:10.687 --> 21:11.897
Yes.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.858
But love
isn't everything.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.861
Is it, Earl Kalf?

21:26.036 --> 21:27.162
Inge!

21:28.038 --> 21:29.706
You wonder where...

21:29.956 --> 21:31.416
Give me some more of this!

21:37.422 --> 21:38.882
Bjorn is teaching
me to fight.

21:39.383 --> 21:40.384
Good.

21:40.592 --> 21:43.678
But remember,
your grandfather, my father,

21:43.929 --> 21:45.722
was the greatest
warrior of all time.

21:45.889 --> 21:49.017
He slayed the dragon Fafnir
and is spoken of in the sagas.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.979
Surely you will
inherit his warlike gifts.

21:55.107 --> 21:58.193
All of you will
be great warriors.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.237
Even you, Ivar.

22:06.743 --> 22:07.786
Ragnar!

22:14.376 --> 22:15.419
Father!

22:22.050 --> 22:23.093
Ragnar!

22:23.176 --> 22:24.594
Sit. Come on.

22:27.055 --> 22:31.101
Please. Everyone, continue.

22:31.852 --> 22:33.770
Forget about poor little me.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.031
Everyone's so happy
to see you, Ragnar.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.827
Perhaps some more
than others, hmm?

22:49.744 --> 22:51.955
Ah, look at my boys, huh?

23:01.590 --> 23:03.008
What have I missed?

23:03.467 --> 23:04.634
You tell him.

23:06.887 --> 23:08.305
Bjorn has arrested Floki.

23:14.436 --> 23:15.479
Yes.

23:26.865 --> 23:27.949
Why? Hmm?

23:29.576 --> 23:31.369
Floki needed
to be dealt with.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.831
You were incapacitated.
I thought it was
the right thing to do.

23:36.541 --> 23:39.294
Did you also think that
if I wanted him arrested

23:40.837 --> 23:42.672
I would have done
it a long time ago?

23:45.842 --> 23:49.930
But now you
have made it public

23:51.139 --> 23:52.682
and left me
with no options.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.770
Now I am forced

23:58.355 --> 23:59.898
to deal with
my errant friend.

24:11.701 --> 24:15.622
Whose stupid idea
was it to leave
Rollo behind in Paris?

24:16.122 --> 24:16.957
He is my uncle!

24:17.040 --> 24:18.667
He is my brother.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.380
And I know him better.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.385
Amen.

29:29.227 --> 29:30.770
I have summoned
you here because
it seems

29:30.853 --> 29:32.230
that I have
made a mistake,

29:32.605 --> 29:34.732
when I announced
that Lagertha and I
would rule together.

29:34.857 --> 29:35.900
Yes.

29:35.984 --> 29:37.902
Apparently,
such an arrangement

29:37.986 --> 29:39.821
is unacceptable to
some of you here.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.657
If it is the will
of the majority,

29:43.491 --> 29:45.702
then, as is our custom,
I will accede to it.

29:46.244 --> 29:48.496
Lagertha will be banished
to wander where she will.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.877
Get back! Get away!

29:55.461 --> 29:56.588
Move!

29:58.423 --> 30:00.883
I ask those of you
who desire her banishment

30:00.967 --> 30:02.510
to cut your mark in the post.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.263
That way we will have
proof of our decision.

30:16.274 --> 30:17.317
Come.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.571
I'll make my mark.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.574
You as well. Good.

30:25.408 --> 30:26.576
It's clear.

30:31.581 --> 30:33.249
There, Earl Kalf.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.002
You have your answer.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.423
And here, Einar, is mine.

30:41.591 --> 30:43.176
Archers!

31:29.597 --> 31:30.807
Wait!

31:50.660 --> 31:53.162
I should have done this
a long time ago, Einar.

32:43.087 --> 32:44.714
Then I don't want to know.

32:44.881 --> 32:45.882
Here!

32:45.965 --> 32:48.176
- Bring it over to this place.
- That's better.

33:11.365 --> 33:12.408
Mmm.

33:15.578 --> 33:17.413
Come on! Come here!

33:17.497 --> 33:19.540
Ha! Ha! Fight me!
Ah!

33:35.932 --> 33:37.099
It'll fit. It'll fit.

33:37.808 --> 33:39.769
I have come to tell
you I'm going away.

33:41.437 --> 33:42.605
To your mother's?

33:43.689 --> 33:44.774
No.

33:48.653 --> 33:49.779
To find Porunn?

33:52.532 --> 33:53.824
No.

33:55.618 --> 33:57.119
I want to go out
into the wilderness.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.413
Away from everything.

34:02.124 --> 34:04.126
To find out
if I can survive.

34:10.675 --> 34:11.926
Where will you go?

34:12.635 --> 34:13.928
I already know a place.

34:14.804 --> 34:16.304
A hunter's lodge
in the interior.

34:18.933 --> 34:20.518
Then you better
leave soon,

34:20.601 --> 34:21.726
before
the winter freeze.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.568
But I think you're making
another foolish decision.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.076
Why are you
really going?

34:40.161 --> 34:42.331
Because you don't
think I can survive.

35:29.462 --> 35:31.213
Are you going to kill me?

35:33.883 --> 35:35.176
You betrayed me.

35:37.345 --> 35:38.763
You betrayed my trust

35:39.597 --> 35:40.890
and my love for you.

35:42.350 --> 35:43.851
I didn't betray you.

35:46.103 --> 35:48.439
I tried to save
you from a false god.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.650
Stop hiding
behind the gods.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.530
You killed Athelstan
out of jealousy.

35:56.656 --> 35:57.782
That is the truth.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.035
Just admit it.

36:05.081 --> 36:06.165
No.

36:07.416 --> 36:10.378
The truth is,
I did as the gods commanded.

36:11.545 --> 36:13.923
And I would do it again,
if they willed it.

36:22.098 --> 36:24.100
Are you going to
kill me or not?

37:01.595 --> 37:02.680
I'm leaving.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.265
What do you mean?

37:04.807 --> 37:06.851
I don't belong here.
I don't belong in Paris.

37:07.643 --> 37:08.811
I'm a wanderer.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.355
I belong to the wide,
wide world.

37:13.941 --> 37:15.317
I don't want
you to leave.

37:17.611 --> 37:19.822
I cannot speak
to these people.

37:21.657 --> 37:24.160
If you want me to stay,
you will have to
cut off my feet.

37:26.495 --> 37:27.621
We may meet again.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.833
After all,
everything that goes around,
finally comes around.

37:33.377 --> 37:36.255
But, farewell for now,
Your Grace!

38:11.916 --> 38:12.958
Eirik!

38:15.920 --> 38:17.046
Welcome!

38:20.633 --> 38:23.093
Come! Take a seat.

38:28.057 --> 38:29.475
We've had
a meeting at the camp.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.352
I thought you
should know about it.

38:34.772 --> 38:35.940
What kind of meeting?

38:36.315 --> 38:38.776
Some of the warriors
are unhappy with
what is happening.

38:39.527 --> 38:43.405
You're a Christian,
a Frankish noble now.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.367
They don't want to
fight for the Franks.

38:47.076 --> 38:48.160
How many?

38:48.410 --> 38:50.955
They don't want to fight
against King Ragnar.

38:51.038 --> 38:52.540
I said how many of them?

38:55.626 --> 38:56.752
Maybe half.

39:01.048 --> 39:03.425
They want you to
come back to the camp
so they can talk to you.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.098
What about you, Eirik?

39:10.599 --> 39:11.767
Hmm?

39:14.270 --> 39:15.896
Are you also unhappy?

39:18.607 --> 39:19.859
No.

39:20.734 --> 39:23.696
That's why I
came straight here
to warn you.

39:27.283 --> 39:29.577
And I am grateful.

39:34.957 --> 39:37.626
Go back to them
and tell them I will
come in due course.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.256
I'll put all of
their minds at ease.

39:46.510 --> 39:47.678
Eirik.

39:53.601 --> 39:54.935
Thank you.

40:12.077 --> 40:15.080
Ah, boys, look after
Ragnar, yes?

40:15.164 --> 40:16.248
Yes.

40:16.332 --> 40:19.752
He is not as strong
as he would like to think.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.507
See you in
the spring, Ivar.
See you then.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.353
Watch for fresh snow drifts.

40:38.938 --> 40:40.564
And for what's
pissing in front of you

40:41.190 --> 40:42.483
as well as behind you.

40:45.819 --> 40:46.987
I'll try to remember that.

40:48.864 --> 40:50.032
Prove me wrong.

41:09.051 --> 41:11.345
Solomon!
This one!

41:16.100 --> 41:19.144
We may never see
him alive again.
You know that, don't you?

41:20.562 --> 41:21.814
Have you seen something?

41:22.731 --> 41:24.650
No, I just meant that...

41:24.733 --> 41:26.819
Then why would you say
something like that?

41:45.004 --> 41:48.424
- Go check the traps, brother!
- Over here!

41:49.299 --> 41:51.260
Did you get the kindling
for your father?

41:54.888 --> 41:56.181
Keep the kindling dry!

41:56.265 --> 41:57.766
Stack them up over here.

41:59.935 --> 42:02.354
Eirik! Rider!

42:04.606 --> 42:06.025
Where's my hammer?

42:11.113 --> 42:12.489
It's Rollo!

42:15.826 --> 42:16.994
I told you he'd come.

42:22.082 --> 42:23.292
Open the gates!

42:56.492 --> 42:58.494
Eirik! Eirik!

42:58.619 --> 42:59.870
It's an ambush!

43:19.348 --> 43:20.390
Eirik!

43:23.685 --> 43:24.853
Run!

43:25.020 --> 43:26.313
Get the children!

43:27.564 --> 43:28.607
Son!

43:43.413 --> 43:44.540
Son!

43:46.583 --> 43:47.709
No!

44:01.890 --> 44:03.058
Rollo!

44:04.393 --> 44:05.978
Stay there, coward!

44:06.687 --> 44:09.982
Death is easy for us!
But not for you!

44:11.233 --> 44:12.484
Traitor!

44:12.693 --> 44:14.027
Shield wall!

44:33.630 --> 44:35.966
Charge!

45:07.289 --> 45:08.498
Rollo!

45:10.083 --> 45:12.502
You have betrayed
your own kind!

45:17.341 --> 45:19.343
But we shall be revenged.

45:21.094 --> 45:23.931
Ragnar is coming!

45:33.690 --> 45:34.983
Ragnar...

45:38.862 --> 45:40.322
Will revenge us.
