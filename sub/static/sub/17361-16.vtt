00:05.296 --> 00:06.752
(buzzing in distance)

00:06.923 --> 00:12.884
J‘ Hang on to the world J‘

00:13.054 --> 00:17.593
J‘ As it spins around... J‘

00:17.767 --> 00:19.303
(breathing shallowly)

00:19.477 --> 00:23.516
J‘ Just don't let J‘

00:23.690 --> 00:28.810
J‘ The spin get you down J‘

00:31.614 --> 00:37.610
J‘ Things are moving fast J‘

00:39.247 --> 00:45.117
J‘ Hold on tight,
and you will last J“

00:45.295 --> 00:47.707
J‘ Give your... J‘

01:33.093 --> 01:36.176
(low rumbling in distance)

01:43.895 --> 01:47.558
Hey, darlin'.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.524
Wake up.

01:51.694 --> 01:55.061
Abraham:
Hey, darlin'. Wake up.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.855
What is it?
Do we need to--?

01:57.033 --> 01:59.695
No, no, no.
We're okay for now.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.953
(sighs)

02:20.390 --> 02:23.302
Well, good afternoon to you.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.218
You're here.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.432
Yeah.
(sighs)

02:28.606 --> 02:30.392
And I'm feelin'
all kinds of glad

02:30.567 --> 02:35.061
to see you right now.
(chuckles)

02:35.238 --> 02:37.274
Are they back?

02:38.491 --> 02:40.277
Not yet.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.659
I know
you were pullin' late shift,

02:43.830 --> 02:44.910
and you wanna tonight,

02:45.081 --> 02:48.073
so I didn't want
to wake you up.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.492
(sighs)
Maggie's in trouble.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.001
What?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.912
Something with the baby.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.330
Rick's taking her
to the doctor at Hilltop.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.466
He doesn't know it yet,
but I'm going with him.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.922
ljust...

03:01.097 --> 03:05.807
I know we just started this,
but I wanted you to--

03:05.977 --> 03:08.263
Don't.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.225
(chucang)
"Don't" what?

03:13.526 --> 03:15.437
Don't go.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.688
(lock disengages,
latch clicks)

03:20.783 --> 03:23.866
(door opens, hinges creak)

03:25.622 --> 03:30.116
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life, Sasha.

03:39.302 --> 03:44.387
You are gonna help make sure
things get back on track today.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.137
You are smart,
hot as hell,

03:48.311 --> 03:49.471
dignified as shit,

03:49.646 --> 03:53.730
and you don't suffer
one goddamn fool.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.515
No one's gonna wanna
watch you die.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.649
I don't wanna see that.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.813
So you don't have to.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.731
But someone does.

04:03.910 --> 04:08.495
Maybe a couple others, tops.

04:08.665 --> 04:14.331
But not you
and not most people.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.837
We are gonna help solve
some shit.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.385
Tuck in.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.341
Big day.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.098
What do you need
from me?

04:52.542 --> 04:54.954
Rick:
Look at me.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.463
Why?

05:04.137 --> 05:07.220
'Cause I want it stopped.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.132
I want Negan dead.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.425
So why don't you kill him?

05:11.602 --> 05:13.058
Can'tjust be me.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.392
They're all Negan.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.808
That girl you murdered...

05:23.072 --> 05:25.063
she had a name.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.860
Her name was Denise,
and she was a doctor.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.403
And she helped people.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.076
I wasn't aiming
for her.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.412
' (gasps)
- (grunts)

05:37.587 --> 05:39.748
(breathing heavily)

05:43.426 --> 05:47.635
Do it. Do it.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.841
You wanna end it this way...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.092
you go ahead.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.271
I'm sorry.
I am.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.027
I know you want to.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.524
He could just be here
to see if you were here.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.693
We can't trust him.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.953
Dwight:
He owned me.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.614
But not anymore.

06:16.793 --> 06:22.163
What I did, I was doing it
for someone else.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.920
She just got away.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.502
So now I'm here.

06:33.017 --> 06:36.930
So are you
because of her.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.139
Tara: Do it!

06:41.317 --> 06:43.603
- There's another choice.
- Tara: Daryl.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.985
- Daryl, you knew her.
- Negan trusts me.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.736
(breathing heavily)

06:47.907 --> 06:50.990
We work together,
we can stop him.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.082
You knew me then...

07:01.879 --> 07:02.959
and you know me now.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.213
You know I'm not lying.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.967
I'm not.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.880
Tara: Do it.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.014
- Do it!
- (breathing sharply)

07:17.353 --> 07:20.390
(breathing heavily)

07:20.565 --> 07:23.557
(breathing shallowly)

07:23.734 --> 07:26.862
They have Sasha,
if she's even alive.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.361
Jesus: Why didn't
you say something?

07:29.532 --> 07:32.865
He could be our only chance
to get her back.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.287
Rosita:
Because I don't trust him.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.700
But I trust Daryl.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.413
Negan's coming soon.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.792
Tomorrow.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.458
Three trucks, probably.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.217
20 Saviors and him.

07:53.806 --> 07:57.219
I can slow them down,

07:57.393 --> 07:59.725
bring some trees down
in the road,

07:59.896 --> 08:02.182
buy a little time
for you guys to get ready.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.563
If you can take them out,
that's where we start.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.155
You kill them,
I'll radio back to the Sanctuary.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.658
The Sanctuary?

08:15.828 --> 08:18.205
Where Negan lives.

08:18.372 --> 08:21.330
That's what they call it.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.709
I can radio back to them
and say everything's okay.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.585
You drive the trucks back,

08:26.756 --> 08:28.087
and I can lead you
right inside,

08:28.257 --> 08:30.748
and, with the right plan,
we can wipe out the rest.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.213
Check to see if your friend's
still alive.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.673
Then, we get
the workers on our side,

08:38.851 --> 08:42.264
build our numbers up,

08:42.438 --> 08:47.228
and go from outpost
to outpost and end this.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.406
Keep talking.

09:03.417 --> 09:08.411
(gate creaking)

09:08.589 --> 09:12.582
Rick: We just started it--
the whole thing.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.797
If he's lyin',
I'm gonna kill him real slow.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.765
When this is done,

09:21.936 --> 09:24.052
I don't give a damn
if he's sorry.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.221
I will kill
that son of a bitch.

09:26.399 --> 09:30.312
If he's lying,

09:30.486 --> 09:32.727
this is already over.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.362
(gate creaking)

09:50.631 --> 09:57.628
J‘ Someday we'll all be free,
yeah... J‘

09:59.515 --> 10:02.177
Oh, I gotta go.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.137
Abraham:
Oh, I gotta go.

10:05.521 --> 10:06.886
Fact is, I figured we'd--

10:07.064 --> 10:10.272
I had a dream.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.774
You...

10:11.944 --> 10:15.357
You had a dream about me?

10:17.533 --> 10:19.945
You died.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.449
Negan:
That's the plan.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.740
That's what I need
from you.

10:26.917 --> 10:31.786
And when you come out,
not a peep.

10:31.964 --> 10:36.082
They will stand down,
if they haven't already.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.969
And then, Lucille here,
well, she gets her three,

10:40.139 --> 10:44.132
and we move forward
with a new understanding.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.265
(chuckles)

10:52.443 --> 10:55.685
Are you--
are you shitting me?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.359
Is that real?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.576
I can do it,
but no one has to die.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.907
You are wrong.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.619
Punishment--

11:08.793 --> 11:12.911
can't do anything
without that.

11:13.089 --> 11:17.423
Punishment is how we built

11:17.593 --> 11:19.629
everything we have.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.089
You think I'm gonna sit here
and let you--

11:21.263 --> 11:23.003
Careful!

11:25.601 --> 11:30.561
You are not letting me
do anything.

11:33.275 --> 11:37.814
No one has to die.

11:38.823 --> 11:43.157
(scoffs)
Okay.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.615
How about this?

11:46.789 --> 11:48.780
One.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.621
Just one.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.706
I mean, lwas gonna
pull three outta the pool,

11:54.880 --> 11:57.622
but just one

11:57.800 --> 12:00.633
and just for you.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.378
Okay.

12:09.145 --> 12:13.229
Just one person
has to die.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.941
(chuckles)

12:18.738 --> 12:21.696
(sighs)

12:21.866 --> 12:24.323
You got me wrapped
around your little finger.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.482
You know that?

12:25.661 --> 12:27.868
And it's not
a man/woman thing.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.164
I mean,
if you had a dick,

12:29.331 --> 12:32.823
I would still have
these feelings.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.333
We roll out in 45.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.926
(hinges creak, door slams)

12:53.981 --> 12:58.520
So we don't have Oceanside,
but we have their guns.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.106
Negan has Sasha.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.520
Daryl wants us
to trust Dwight.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.734
Rick wants us to stay here
in case things go wrong

13:04.909 --> 13:07.867
so there's
another card to play,

13:08.037 --> 13:10.528
another safe place
the Saviors think they control.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.288
But he doesn't know
that Gregory's gone...

13:13.459 --> 13:14.915
that maybe
he's telling them things

13:15.085 --> 13:17.292
that'll make them think
something else.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.372
And it's all
about to happen.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.336
You're thinking of leading
the Hilltop over there to fight.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.376
lam.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.885
If Negan finds out
they're planning something,

13:27.056 --> 13:28.796
they're gonna need help,

13:28.974 --> 13:30.839
even with those Scavengers
on their side.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.883
Well, you'd have
to decide right now,

13:33.062 --> 13:36.270
and it's
a very tough decision.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.599
Why are you smiling?

13:40.778 --> 13:43.611
'Cause I'm glad you're
the one making it for us.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.942
(scoffs)

13:47.368 --> 13:50.610
(Judith coos)

13:55.960 --> 13:58.076
How do I?

13:58.254 --> 13:59.790
Jesus: I don't know.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.795
ljust know you can.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.378
(coos)

14:04.552 --> 14:07.089
Let me take her.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.800
You take this.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.259
(babbles)

14:11.433 --> 14:12.593
Enid: Yeah.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.475
Mm. Hmm?

14:31.829 --> 14:33.444
Guns up, now.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.908
(guns cock,
Shiva growls lightly)

14:36.083 --> 14:40.122
What the hell?
He's dead.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.502
What is it?

14:43.090 --> 14:45.081
We've seen this before.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.749
(Shiva growling softly)

14:46.927 --> 14:48.337
Morgan: Same ones.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.635
(sighs)

14:53.809 --> 14:56.767
Jerry:
Dude, you okay?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.858
You're gonna ambush them
on your own?

15:05.029 --> 15:07.441
Yeah.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.321
Going alone
doesn't work for this.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.743
It works for me.

15:13.704 --> 15:17.322
Have you killed
any of them?

15:17.499 --> 15:19.956
Because if you have
and they've found out,

15:20.127 --> 15:21.492
they may think
it was the Kingdom,

15:21.670 --> 15:23.251
and we lose
our advantage.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.921
It's from walkers.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.545
Daniel:
Can we move them aside?

15:33.724 --> 15:36.136
(Shiva growls lightly)

15:45.069 --> 15:48.561
Do you seek to extinguish
everything of who you were?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.320
I don't seek it, but...

15:57.915 --> 15:59.997
I'm stuck.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.376
You want
the Saviors dead?

16:04.546 --> 16:07.128
- Morgan.
- Yes, I do.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.251
Cease this folly.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.670
Accompany my regiment.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.976
The Saviors are a dragon
with many heads,

16:18.143 --> 16:20.179
their numbers legion.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.687
We must seek allies
in this endeavor.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.902
That's Benjamin's armor.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.739
Do you wear it to serve you,
or do you wear it in his honor?

16:40.916 --> 16:43.202
Morgan...

16:44.920 --> 16:50.085
you are not stuck.

16:50.259 --> 16:54.593
Join us on this journey
to create an alliance.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.755
Fight with us,

16:57.933 --> 17:02.723
and we shall defeat them
so that no one will suffer

17:02.896 --> 17:05.933
under their capricious
malevolence ever again.

17:16.243 --> 17:19.781
And we start
once more for the fallen...

17:19.955 --> 17:21.115
for the Kingdom...

17:21.290 --> 17:22.405
(Shiva growling softly)

17:22.583 --> 17:25.165
Ezekiel:
...for the glory of victory.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.496
Ho!

17:44.480 --> 17:46.812
(birds chirping)

17:46.982 --> 17:48.938
(vehicles approaching)

18:24.978 --> 18:28.721
(brakes squeak)

18:28.899 --> 18:32.562
(engines stop,
air brakes hiss)

18:34.488 --> 18:38.151
(gate creaking)

18:43.914 --> 18:46.326
(creaking stops)

18:48.377 --> 18:51.039
(gate bangs)

18:51.213 --> 18:52.373
What you fight for.

18:52.548 --> 18:57.588
Not the place--
the people, each other.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.672
You're a part of that now.

18:59.847 --> 19:03.886
We take.
We don't bother-- our way.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.471
Maybe another way.

19:08.897 --> 19:13.231
Yours?

19:13.402 --> 19:16.064
Yeah, we're together.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.650
I lay with him after.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.236
You care?

19:24.788 --> 19:27.200
- We should get back to work.
- Yeah.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.429
(chainsaw buzzing)

20:38.153 --> 20:39.142
Think this was them?

20:39.321 --> 20:41.277
Negan:
Crossed my mind.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.482
We got a plan "B.'

20:44.660 --> 20:47.242
lfl might be so bold...

20:47.412 --> 20:49.073
this unexpected stoppage
has given me

20:49.248 --> 20:51.159
the chance
for an exhaustive mull.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.244
Now, given
the loaded circumstances

20:53.418 --> 20:56.581
and potential for casualties
and resource expenditure,

20:56.755 --> 20:58.541
l was wondering if you would
give me the opportunity

20:58.715 --> 21:01.673
to attempt to slow theirjets
and cool their roll.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.549
(chainsaws buzzing)

21:12.104 --> 21:14.470
(brakes squeak,
engine shuts off)

21:34.084 --> 21:37.497
You shoot
one of these before?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.457
Good.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.541
Worry?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.926
(sighs)

21:46.096 --> 21:47.211
No.

21:47.389 --> 21:51.007
Good.

21:51.184 --> 21:54.017
- I'll be on the next one over.
- Why?

21:54.187 --> 21:57.020
It's more sight lines
if we split up.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.976
I'll go.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.937
You sure?

22:02.070 --> 22:04.061
Okay.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.783
We win.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.781
Yeah.

22:25.427 --> 22:30.592
(Donny Hathaway's
"Someday We'll All Be Free" playing)

22:35.687 --> 22:38.804
(breathing shallowly)

22:38.982 --> 22:42.065
(rumbling in distance)

22:45.280 --> 22:47.942
You know
what's gonna happen,

22:48.116 --> 22:51.233
how this is gonna end.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.322
You know
what's gonna happen...

22:55.457 --> 22:58.790
how this is gonna end.

22:58.960 --> 23:03.044
We're gonna walk
out that door together.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.922
We kick shit
and eat snakes.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.459
- That's us.
- We can sit this one out.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.799
They need us here, anyway.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.884
Rick said to get ready
for a fight.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.470
How'd I die?

23:19.648 --> 23:22.139
(sighs)

23:22.317 --> 23:25.104
We were at the beach.

23:25.278 --> 23:26.814
It was before.

23:26.988 --> 23:29.240
Mm.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.740
You got pulled under...

23:32.744 --> 23:34.655
and you didn't
come back up.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.702
l was trying to find you,
but you were gone.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.586
And then,
I started to drown.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.165
I hate the beach.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.755
(sighs)

23:50.929 --> 23:53.636
End of the day
in a wet suit?

23:53.807 --> 23:55.343
It's like you're sandblasting
your nutsack

23:55.517 --> 23:57.098
every single step
you take back to the car.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.011
- (laughs)
- (chuckles)

24:00.188 --> 24:03.305
Luckily, the seaside
ain't on the agenda today.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.895
Just security
and some road to chew.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.360
All right?
So, come on.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.364
- Let's go help Maggie.
- Abraham.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.025
What?

24:15.203 --> 24:17.194
They could use us here.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.454
(sighs)

24:19.624 --> 24:23.833
Just once,
we sit one out.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.211
- Someone else--
- It should be us.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.793
Maggie's gotta take care
of Maggie.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.379
Have you, uh,
changed your mind

24:35.557 --> 24:38.845
about taking
that allergy medication?

24:39.019 --> 24:40.884
- Yes.
- Good.

24:41.062 --> 24:45.772
I think you'll get adjusted
to the place, sinus-wise.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.728
No, I won't.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.565
Not like you.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.070
Everyone has a way out.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.901
Don't go and yuck my yum
for takin' mine,

24:54.075 --> 24:57.283
which, I may add,
is the same as yours now.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.912
If people die today, it's 'cause
of the choices they made.

25:01.082 --> 25:04.040
Yeah. It is.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.745
(sighs)

25:07.923 --> 25:09.288
Why are we here?

25:09.466 --> 25:13.755
(birds chirping)

25:13.929 --> 25:16.011
For this.

25:20.602 --> 25:25.187
(turkey call sounding)

25:25.357 --> 25:28.474
(turkey call sounds in distance)

25:37.994 --> 25:40.406
Rosita.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.491
Get into position.

25:42.666 --> 25:46.250
l'll signal you.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.626
And the wall's gonna hold?

25:48.797 --> 25:54.167
It'll hold.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.505
(vehicles approaching)

26:00.016 --> 26:02.678
Eugene:
All points are covered.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.343
Every contingency
is already met.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.514
I come armed
with two barrels of the truth.

26:08.692 --> 26:09.898
A test is upon you,

26:10.068 --> 26:12.184
and I'm giving out
the cheat sheet.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.946
(brakes squeak)

26:20.579 --> 26:22.570
(air brakes hiss)

26:22.747 --> 26:27.036
(engines shut off)

26:27.210 --> 26:30.452
H-hello.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.712
I come salved with the hope
that it is my dropped knowledge

26:32.882 --> 26:34.167
that you heed.

26:34.342 --> 26:37.505
Options are zero to none.
(sighs)

26:37.679 --> 26:39.465
Compliance and fealty are
your only escape.

26:39.639 --> 26:43.928
Bottom-lining it--
you may thrive, or you may die.

26:44.102 --> 26:46.559
I sincerely wish
for the former

26:46.730 --> 26:49.392
for everyone's sake.

26:49.566 --> 26:54.151
The jig is up
and in full effect.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.903
Will you comply, Rick?

27:08.084 --> 27:09.949
Where's Negan?

27:14.424 --> 27:17.382
l'm Negan.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.314
(sighs)

27:40.575 --> 27:42.486
(sighs)

28:03.723 --> 28:05.714
(sighs)

28:09.688 --> 28:12.805
(guns cock)

28:21.282 --> 28:23.364
(lock clicks)

28:28.998 --> 28:31.330
(gate thuds)

28:57.694 --> 29:00.652
(breathing heavily)

29:13.835 --> 29:15.791
No.

29:15.962 --> 29:19.204
- (rifle cocks)
- We win.

29:29.017 --> 29:32.009
You ever hear the one about
the stupid little prick named Rick

29:32.187 --> 29:34.849
who thought he knew shit
but didn't know shit

29:35.023 --> 29:39.187
and got everyone
that he gave a shit about killed?

29:41.029 --> 29:43.862
It's about you.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.865
You're all gonna wanna put
your guns down now.

29:47.035 --> 29:50.368
No one drops anything.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.369
We had a deal.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.280
Tamiel came
for the boat things.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.166
Followed ones who took.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.544
Made a better deal.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.875
(sighs)

30:02.050 --> 30:06.794
Negan: You push me
and you push me.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.634
And you push me, Rick.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.266
You just tried
to blow us up, right?

30:13.436 --> 30:18.100
I mean,
I get me, my people.

30:18.274 --> 30:21.016
But Eugene?

30:22.403 --> 30:24.234
He's one of yours.

30:24.405 --> 30:28.990
And after what he did--
he stepped up.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.242
You people...

30:31.412 --> 30:34.199
are animals.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.949
Universe gives you a sign,
and you just

30:38.127 --> 30:41.460
shove your finger
right up its ass.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.418
(Negan laughs)

30:44.592 --> 30:48.084
Dwight, Simon, chop-chop.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.580
(sighs)

31:25.466 --> 31:28.082
So, you don't like Eugene
anymore.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.421
You guys gotta like Sasha.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.428
I do, too.

31:39.564 --> 31:43.022
Got her right here
packaged for your convenience,

31:43.192 --> 31:46.275
alive and well.

31:47.822 --> 31:51.906
Now, I brought her so I wouldn't
have to kill all of you,

31:52.076 --> 31:56.695
and not killing all of you
could get complicated.

31:56.873 --> 32:01.037
See, I know there's a lot
of firepower left in there, Rick.

32:01.210 --> 32:04.373
So I'm gonna make this simple.

32:04.547 --> 32:08.415
I want all the guns
you've managed to scrape up.

32:08.593 --> 32:12.006
Yep, I know
about those, too.

32:13.681 --> 32:17.594
I want every last grain
of lemonade you got left.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.307
I want a person
of your own choosing...

32:23.524 --> 32:24.775
for Lucille.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.029
Daryl--

32:31.199 --> 32:33.986
ooh, I gotta get me
my Daryl back.

32:35.411 --> 32:37.993
| see you.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.530
And the pool table

32:40.708 --> 32:42.369
and all the pool cues
and chalk.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.534
And I want it now

32:44.712 --> 32:47.169
or Sasha dies,

32:47.340 --> 32:51.333
and then all of you.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.502
Probably.

32:54.889 --> 32:57.130
Come on, Rick.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.220
Just because I brought her
in a casket

33:00.395 --> 33:02.556
doesn't mean
she has to leave in it.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.481
(sighs)

33:07.652 --> 33:09.483
(chuckles)

33:09.654 --> 33:12.270
You know what?

33:12.448 --> 33:15.906
You suck ass, Rick.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.658
You really do.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.069
I don't want
to have to kill her,

33:19.247 --> 33:21.408
but that's exactly
what you're gonna make me do.

33:21.582 --> 33:23.994
Let me see her.

33:25.586 --> 33:28.293
(chucang)
Oh.

33:28.464 --> 33:31.501
All right.
Just give me a second.

33:31.676 --> 33:32.882
I might have
to get her up to speed.

33:33.052 --> 33:35.464
You can't hear shit
inside this thing.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.598
Sash.

33:41.769 --> 33:44.146
You're not gonna believe
this crap.

33:44.313 --> 33:47.601
(Donny Hathaway's
"Someday We'll All Be Free" playing)

33:52.238 --> 33:55.822
It felt real.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.404
It felt real.

34:02.331 --> 34:06.290
Like we lost this.
(sighs)

34:06.461 --> 34:09.328
And this just started.

34:36.491 --> 34:40.359
(sighs, sniffles)

34:40.536 --> 34:44.449
- Come on.
- Wait.

34:44.624 --> 34:46.114
(sighs)

34:46.292 --> 34:48.408
I like the way
you call bullshit.

34:50.546 --> 34:53.333
So let me return
the favor.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.965
The next thing
you're gonna tell me

34:56.135 --> 34:59.002
is that you'll go
and that I can stay.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.546
Because I know you didn't like
hearing yourselfjust say

35:01.724 --> 35:05.467
that, "Maggie's gotta
take care of Maggie."

35:05.645 --> 35:07.135
I know those words
are gonna choke in your ears

35:07.313 --> 35:08.678
a good, long while

35:08.856 --> 35:11.233
and you're gonna wanna make up
for even thinking that.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.652
Am I right?

35:14.695 --> 35:16.606
Yeah.

35:19.992 --> 35:22.529
We lay our big meaties
across the chopping block

35:22.703 --> 35:25.695
ahead of someone else's.

35:25.873 --> 35:29.536
It's always
for someone else.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.371
Both of us know,
if we're gonna kick,

35:31.546 --> 35:33.537
there sure as hell better be
a point to it.

35:33.714 --> 35:38.834
So maybe we feel there was
a-a point to all of this.

35:40.179 --> 35:43.046
Alpha to omega.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.636
Whether it's
on the battlefield or the beach

35:45.810 --> 35:50.395
or somewhere
out there today.

35:50.565 --> 35:54.023
Maggie--

35:54.193 --> 35:56.104
she's carrying
the future.

36:03.244 --> 36:05.485
You're right.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.743
(sniffles)

36:09.917 --> 36:12.750
I knew
how this was gonna end.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.587
Come on.

36:16.757 --> 36:21.251
Layin' your ass
on the line for someone else,

36:21.429 --> 36:23.636
tearin' it to shreds
for 'em--

36:25.600 --> 36:27.716
you said it before.

36:27.894 --> 36:31.432
Oh, my, that is living.

36:34.817 --> 36:38.025
(chuckles)
You're an idiot.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.359
I never said otherwise.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.879
(sighs)

37:00.801 --> 37:02.632
A couple hours
to get there, right?

37:02.803 --> 37:03.963
At least.

37:04.138 --> 37:07.096
Might be a circuitous
and janky route.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.301
With what they're planning,

37:08.476 --> 37:10.137
they could be watching
the roads.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.801
"What they're planning."

37:11.979 --> 37:13.139
That's right.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.435
Got it in the marketplace.
It's chock-full.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.522
Doubt conversation will be
on tap for the commute.

37:20.696 --> 37:22.732
And though
I am a selfish coward,

37:22.907 --> 37:25.990
I do tend to think
of other people on occasion.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.526
Please take it
with my compliments.

37:28.704 --> 37:31.286
I truly wish
I measured up.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.997
You still can, Eugene.

37:37.171 --> 37:40.663
I'm not giving up.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.502
Not on you.

37:46.472 --> 37:49.714
Jesus, you don't have to take
the trip in the thing.

37:49.892 --> 37:52.133
I could use the rest.

37:52.311 --> 37:53.687
No shit?

37:53.854 --> 37:55.390
Yeah.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.727
ljust want
to go to sleep.

37:58.901 --> 38:01.017
ljust need a little bottle
of water, and I'm fine.

38:01.195 --> 38:04.278
(breathes deeply)
Arat? (sighs)

38:05.408 --> 38:07.319
Listen...

38:09.704 --> 38:13.037
I know
how tough this is.

38:13.207 --> 38:15.619
And I appreciate it.

38:27.263 --> 38:31.723
Damn, you are
something else.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.140
(knocks twice
on coffin)

38:34.312 --> 38:35.722
(lid creaks, thuds)

38:37.732 --> 38:40.189
(music player clicking)

38:54.915 --> 38:59.204
(Donny Hathaway's
"Someday We'll All Be Free" playing)

38:59.378 --> 39:02.461
(engine starts)

39:02.631 --> 39:06.340
(engine rumbling)

39:09.513 --> 39:15.258
J‘ Hang on to the world J‘

39:15.436 --> 39:20.226
J‘ As it spins around... J‘

39:20.399 --> 39:21.730
(sighs)

39:21.901 --> 39:26.395
J‘ Just don't let J‘

39:26.572 --> 39:33.410
J‘ The spin get you down J‘

39:34.413 --> 39:36.950
J‘ Things are moving fast... .l‘

39:37.124 --> 39:38.239
(knock on lid)

39:38.417 --> 39:40.578
Sash.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.744
You're not gonna believe
this crap.

39:42.922 --> 39:46.414
(growling)
Holy goddamn!

39:49.303 --> 39:51.294
(gunfire)

39:51.472 --> 39:53.212
(groans)

40:03.692 --> 40:05.899
(both grunt)

40:11.075 --> 40:12.155
(gunfire continues)

40:12.326 --> 40:13.987
(grunts)

40:14.161 --> 40:15.992
(groaning)

40:23.003 --> 40:24.743
Man: Go! Go!

40:31.762 --> 40:33.548
No.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.174
- (growlin
-Aah! g)

40:38.352 --> 40:41.844
(grunts)
Honey, God damn it!

40:45.276 --> 40:46.686
(screaming)

40:49.822 --> 40:52.564
(gunfire continues)

40:54.118 --> 40:55.858
(shouts)

40:56.036 --> 40:57.822
Plan "B" it is!

40:57.997 --> 40:59.203
(gunshot)

40:59.373 --> 41:01.113
Down. Now.

41:01.292 --> 41:05.035
We can make another deal.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.327
Aah!

41:06.505 --> 41:09.497
(groaning)

41:09.675 --> 41:11.381
Aah!

41:11.552 --> 41:13.042
(gunfire continues)

41:13.220 --> 41:14.835
Said "down."

41:18.309 --> 41:20.550
(gunfire)

41:53.093 --> 41:56.426
(gunfire in distance)

41:56.597 --> 41:59.430
(man shouting indistinctly)

42:13.072 --> 42:15.188
(gasps, groans)

42:15.366 --> 42:17.231
Move.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.744
Hello again.

42:34.760 --> 42:38.719
(Farron growling)

42:38.889 --> 42:41.130
(Michonne choking)

42:43.310 --> 42:45.096
Aah!

42:50.985 --> 42:52.646
(gunfire in distance)

42:53.696 --> 42:56.278
Down.
Or again.

42:58.826 --> 43:02.159
(men shout indistinctly
in distance)

43:02.329 --> 43:05.162
Well, shit, Rick.

43:05.332 --> 43:07.197
You just couldn't
stick with us, huh?

43:07.376 --> 43:11.494
You had to go with
these filthy garbage people?

43:11.672 --> 43:13.333
No offense.

43:13.507 --> 43:17.500
Deal is for 12, yes?

43:17.678 --> 43:19.964
10.

43:20.139 --> 43:21.925
People are a resource.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.930
12.

43:24.101 --> 43:26.387
(gunfire in distance)

43:32.192 --> 43:33.693
10.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.319
(chuckles)

43:39.033 --> 43:40.694
(sighs)

43:40.868 --> 43:43.359
Rick.

43:43.537 --> 43:46.700
This is just gonna
make you sad.

43:46.874 --> 43:49.490
Broken.

43:49.668 --> 43:52.876
You're gonna wish
you were dead.

43:53.047 --> 43:55.288
(sighs)

43:55.466 --> 43:58.003
I like having fun.

43:58.177 --> 44:00.168
I do.

44:00.346 --> 44:02.382
But maybe you think
that the guy that did

44:02.556 --> 44:06.048
what he did
to your friends wasn't me,

44:06.226 --> 44:08.057
like that was some sort
of a put-on,

44:08.228 --> 44:10.184
like I'm not
the guy with the bat--

44:10.356 --> 44:13.268
I'm just the guy that makes
your kid spaghetti.

44:13.442 --> 44:15.524
(gunfire in distance)

44:15.694 --> 44:17.230
Oh.

44:17.404 --> 44:20.066
Oh, shit.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.525
Maybe this is on me.

44:21.700 --> 44:25.067
Maybe this is
all on me.

44:25.245 --> 44:26.371
(gunfire continues)

44:26.538 --> 44:30.451
I gotta make it right.

44:30.626 --> 44:34.084
I guess I gotta start
all over again.

44:34.254 --> 44:37.041
I gotta tell you, Rick,

44:37.216 --> 44:39.457
ifl had a kid,

44:43.597 --> 44:46.634
which makes this
so much harder.

44:46.809 --> 44:48.925
You're not gonna win.

44:49.103 --> 44:51.719
Carl.

44:51.897 --> 44:54.263
It is over.

44:54.441 --> 44:55.772
Why don't you point
your one ball

44:55.943 --> 45:01.188
up the street there
and take it all in?

45:02.783 --> 45:06.071
(grunting)

45:06.245 --> 45:07.485
We'll win!

45:07.663 --> 45:11.155
We live!

45:11.333 --> 45:14.951
We're the ones!

45:15.129 --> 45:18.246
Us!
(grunts)

45:26.515 --> 45:30.303
(woman screams)

45:30.477 --> 45:32.889
(gasps lightly)

45:35.524 --> 45:37.230
(Negan chuckling)
Ohh.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.146
Oh.

45:43.824 --> 45:45.780
Wow.

45:45.951 --> 45:48.658
You just lost
somebody important to you

45:48.829 --> 45:51.992
right now--
like, just now.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.327
Jesus.

45:54.501 --> 45:57.584
That is timing.

46:00.966 --> 46:03.673
Well, Rick...

46:03.844 --> 46:06.005
you chose this.

46:06.180 --> 46:09.798
I truly don't know what more
lcould've done to warn you.

46:09.975 --> 46:11.340
And this isn't a warning.

46:11.518 --> 46:14.100
This is punishment.

46:16.356 --> 46:18.938
I'm gonna kill Carl now.

46:19.109 --> 46:21.350
I'm gonna make it

46:21.528 --> 46:25.567
one nice, hard swing,

46:25.741 --> 46:28.949
try to do it in one
because I like him.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.695
ljust want you
to put that in your brain

46:32.873 --> 46:34.909
and roll it around
for a minute.

46:35.083 --> 46:39.543
I'm gonna kill Carl,
and then Lucille here,

46:39.713 --> 46:42.546
she's gonna take
yourhands.

46:45.385 --> 46:48.047
You can do it
right in front of me.

46:48.222 --> 46:51.885
You can take my hands.

46:52.059 --> 46:54.015
I told you already--

46:54.186 --> 46:57.553
I'm gonna kill you.

46:57.731 --> 47:00.017
All of you.

47:00.192 --> 47:04.777
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow...

47:04.947 --> 47:08.405
but nothing is
gonna change that--

47:08.575 --> 47:10.031
nothing.

47:12.579 --> 47:15.412
You're all already dead.

47:23.966 --> 47:26.332
(chucang)

47:32.140 --> 47:34.051
Damn.

47:36.228 --> 47:38.640
Wow, Rick.

47:42.276 --> 47:44.813
Okay.

47:46.071 --> 47:48.608
(Negan grunts)

47:49.741 --> 47:52.118
You said I could do it.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.277
(Shiva roars,
all shout indistinctly)

47:54.454 --> 47:58.618
- (man screaming)
- (gunfire)

47:58.792 --> 48:01.955
(horse neighs)

48:02.129 --> 48:06.748
End these Saviors
and their accomplices!

48:06.925 --> 48:10.793
Alexandria will not fall,
not on this day!

48:12.931 --> 48:14.796
(gunfire continues)

48:14.975 --> 48:17.091
(screaming)

48:21.982 --> 48:24.473
- (rifle cocks)
- Aah!

48:24.651 --> 48:26.983
Fan out,
third group, now!

48:27.154 --> 48:29.315
Close up!
Now we got your backs!

48:34.494 --> 48:37.702
(horse neighs)

48:39.666 --> 48:41.497
A goddamn tiger!

48:41.668 --> 48:44.535
(gunfire continues)

48:53.680 --> 48:56.137
That widow is alive,
guns a-blazin'!

48:56.308 --> 48:58.173
(machine gun clicks)

48:58.352 --> 49:00.968
You taste that, Simon?
That is the taste of shit!

49:04.691 --> 49:05.897
(Shiva growls)

49:06.068 --> 49:08.150
(gunfire continues)

49:28.715 --> 49:31.832
(gunfire continues,
bullets ricochet)

50:14.344 --> 50:16.926
(gunfire in distance)

50:17.097 --> 50:19.133
Rick:
They're falling back.

50:19.307 --> 50:20.592
Maggie: Eduardo, Bertie,
between the houses--

50:20.767 --> 50:21.847
cover the gate!

50:22.019 --> 50:23.259
(gunfire in distance)

50:23.437 --> 50:24.802
Let's go.

50:27.190 --> 50:29.272
Ezekiel:
Now we finish this!

50:32.154 --> 50:35.191
(horse neighs,
gunfire continues)

50:49.963 --> 50:52.955
(gunfire, bullets ricocheting)

51:10.150 --> 51:11.606
(horse neighs)

51:11.777 --> 51:14.860
(gate creaking)

51:32.089 --> 51:33.579
Now!

51:38.095 --> 51:40.086
- Pull!
- (all grunt)

52:14.131 --> 52:17.794
(both panting)

52:23.723 --> 52:25.463
(breathing heavily)

52:32.107 --> 52:34.519
(latch clicks, door opens)

52:41.158 --> 52:44.992
Michonne.

52:45.162 --> 52:48.575
- Michonne.
- (breathes shallowly)

52:48.748 --> 52:50.739
(sighs)
Oh, you're alive.

52:50.917 --> 52:53.329
(breathing heavily)

53:06.391 --> 53:09.849
We-- w-we're...

53:12.189 --> 53:13.224
We're...

53:13.398 --> 53:15.684
- I know. I know.
- (gaspS)

53:15.859 --> 53:17.690
I know.

53:19.362 --> 53:21.478
We are.

53:24.117 --> 53:25.857
We will.

53:33.460 --> 53:36.247
(crying)

53:48.225 --> 53:51.308
Getting preparations
in place.

53:51.478 --> 53:54.094
Everyone's
on "blue level."

53:54.272 --> 53:57.139
You say the word,
they're ready to go.

53:57.317 --> 53:59.057
That's good.

54:11.498 --> 54:14.990
How the hell do you think
she wound up dead in that box?

54:17.587 --> 54:21.045
My, um, best possible posit
fingers the tarp.

54:21.216 --> 54:23.832
That sealed up said box
good and tight.

54:25.637 --> 54:28.003
She ran out of air.

54:43.613 --> 54:46.275
Maybe.

54:56.418 --> 54:59.205
(sighs)

54:59.379 --> 55:01.119
So...

55:07.721 --> 55:09.632
we are going to war!

55:09.806 --> 55:12.548
All: Yes, sir!

55:23.236 --> 55:27.195
Rick: Do you think
Sasha did that herself?

55:27.365 --> 55:30.698
Maggie: I don't know how,
but I know she did.

55:36.833 --> 55:39.495
She gave us a chance.
You did.

55:39.669 --> 55:43.537
You made
the right decision to come.

55:43.715 --> 55:48.129
The decision was made
a long time ago,

55:48.303 --> 55:51.966
before any of us knew
each other,

55:52.140 --> 55:54.096
when we were all strangers
who would have

55:54.267 --> 55:55.677
just passed each other
on the street

55:55.852 --> 55:57.592
before the world ended.

56:00.273 --> 56:02.685
And now we mean everything
to each other.

56:34.557 --> 56:36.889
(knife unsheathes)

56:41.689 --> 56:45.102
You were in trouble.
You were trapped.

56:45.276 --> 56:48.359
Glenn didn't know you,
but he helped you.

56:48.530 --> 56:51.738
He put himself in danger
for you.

56:54.369 --> 56:57.111
And that started it all--

56:58.206 --> 57:02.540
from Atlanta,
to my daddy's farm,

57:02.710 --> 57:05.622
to the prison,

57:05.797 --> 57:07.628
to here...

57:16.057 --> 57:18.048
to this moment now...

57:21.146 --> 57:24.855
not as strangers--

57:25.024 --> 57:27.106
as family...

58:00.185 --> 58:04.975
because Glenn chose
to be there for you that day

58:05.148 --> 58:07.890
a long time ago.

58:08.067 --> 58:11.434
That was the decision
that changed everything.

58:20.705 --> 58:22.866
It started
with both of you,

58:23.041 --> 58:25.532
and it just grew...

58:25.710 --> 58:30.921
to all of us...

58:31.090 --> 58:33.923
to sacrifice
for each other...

58:47.899 --> 58:51.642
to suffer and stand,

58:51.819 --> 58:55.232
to grieve, to give,

58:56.950 --> 59:00.113
to love, to live...

59:03.289 --> 59:04.870
to fight for each other.

59:05.041 --> 59:07.657
(no dialogue)

59:10.463 --> 59:13.876
Maggie's voice:
Glenn made the decision, Rick.

59:14.050 --> 59:17.087
l was just following
his lead.

59:27.146 --> 59:31.105
