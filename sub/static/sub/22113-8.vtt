WEBVTT

00:00.334 --> 00:02.519
Previously on The Last Man On Earth

00:02.544 --> 00:04.140
And now with the twins and Dawn,

00:04.171 --> 00:06.106
there's seven ladies and only three men.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.097
If you want a playdate so bad,

00:07.199 --> 00:08.531
there's an obvious solution.

00:08.556 --> 00:09.488
Jasper?

00:09.675 --> 00:11.742
You want to hang out or something?

00:11.921 --> 00:14.904
I now pronounce you regular married.

01:20.003 --> 01:23.356
Jasper, were you just
driving that limousine?

01:23.381 --> 01:24.517
No.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.153
Uh, I think you were.

01:26.178 --> 01:28.308
Jas-Jasper?

01:28.487 --> 01:31.114
Please come back here when
I'm talking to you, please.

01:32.151 --> 01:34.342
Jasper?

01:34.367 --> 01:36.299
Another please.

01:38.430 --> 01:39.703
Okay.

01:39.728 --> 01:41.528
I'll come to you.

02:04.326 --> 02:05.991
Finally.

02:06.016 --> 02:07.883
Some peace and quiet.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.060
This is my new favorite room.

02:22.134 --> 02:24.818
Oh, hey. STD, sorry to disturb.

02:24.843 --> 02:25.943
Just be a sec.

02:25.968 --> 02:29.300
You see a box in here
labeled "adult magazines"?

02:29.325 --> 02:30.357
W-Wait, oh, no.

02:30.382 --> 02:31.770
It's not what you think.

02:31.795 --> 02:34.052
You know, it was just a
bunch of, like, Economists

02:34.077 --> 02:36.146
and New Yorkers, Audubons.

02:36.248 --> 02:37.835
That kind of fare. Oh!

02:37.860 --> 02:40.594
Here we go. Right here, okay.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.585
Let's see...

02:45.540 --> 02:47.773
Ah, there she is. Okay.

02:47.798 --> 02:49.267
Sorry, excuse me.

02:49.292 --> 02:51.258
Just be right beside you.

02:54.556 --> 02:57.506
And with that, I will get
out of your hair, milady.

02:57.733 --> 02:59.600
Have a good day.

03:05.464 --> 03:06.999
Hi, Mom.

03:07.024 --> 03:08.757
I finally finished your wedding present.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.486
Well, let's see it.

03:10.588 --> 03:13.422
Well, you know how people
always say, "It's such a shame

03:13.524 --> 03:16.358
you only get to wear your
wedding jumpsuit dress once"?

03:16.460 --> 03:19.469
Well, now you can wear it every day.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.695
Ta-da!

03:28.439 --> 03:30.639
Erica, don't be jealous.

03:30.741 --> 03:32.641
I'm gonna do yours next.

03:32.743 --> 03:35.411
Oh. I appreciate that, but, actually,

03:35.513 --> 03:37.613
I think I'm gonna
save my dress for Dawn.

03:37.715 --> 03:39.448
- Oh.
- Good Lord, are you already

03:39.550 --> 03:41.250
planning her wedding?

03:41.352 --> 03:43.385
Who the hell are you
gonna marry her off to?

03:43.487 --> 03:45.521
I don't know, we're
kind of short on supply.

03:45.623 --> 03:48.290
- I guess, uh...
- Uh...

03:48.392 --> 03:49.425
- Jasper.
- Yep.

03:49.527 --> 03:51.360
- Jasper.
- Watch out, Carol.

03:51.462 --> 03:54.496
Erica's already measuring
Jasper for his tuxedo.

03:54.598 --> 03:56.398
You better get in there quick or Mike

03:56.500 --> 03:58.400
and Bezequille are gonna
be the youngest spinsters

03:58.502 --> 03:59.668
in the history of the world.

04:01.794 --> 04:03.205
Yeah.

04:03.307 --> 04:06.244
Actually, I think Jasper's
gonna be quite the lady-killer.

04:06.269 --> 04:07.543
- You know, he came up to Dawn,
- Yeah.

04:07.645 --> 04:09.511
And he gave her a flower the other day.

04:09.613 --> 04:11.246
Did he really?

04:11.348 --> 04:12.347
She's a little flirt.

04:12.450 --> 04:14.616
- Just like her mom.
- Oh, stop.

04:17.365 --> 04:18.720
So cute.

04:28.732 --> 04:30.232
Jasper, what are you doing?

04:30.662 --> 04:31.828
Nothing.

04:32.536 --> 04:34.403
J-Jasper,

04:34.505 --> 04:37.239
did you just put a
firework in that giraffe?

04:37.341 --> 04:38.307
No.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.542
Are you lying?

04:40.644 --> 04:41.577
Yeah.

04:41.679 --> 04:43.345
Well, thank you...

04:43.997 --> 04:45.411
for being honest.

04:45.436 --> 04:47.393
But e-explosives

04:47.891 --> 04:50.452
are not appropriate for minors.

04:50.554 --> 04:53.489
They're for adults and miners.

04:54.176 --> 04:55.469
Coal miners.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.338
It-It's a different "miners."

05:00.254 --> 05:01.296
Understood?

05:01.398 --> 05:02.331
Yeah.

05:02.433 --> 05:05.601
Okay, well, th-thank you, Jasper.

05:06.684 --> 05:08.182
Jasper!

05:08.207 --> 05:11.315
What did I just say to
you not five seconds ago?

05:12.409 --> 05:14.409
Okay, you know what?
That's it, you're grounded.

05:14.512 --> 05:15.634
What's "grounded"?

05:15.659 --> 05:17.546
It means that you
have to go to your room

05:17.571 --> 05:20.172
and no video games for a week.

05:20.218 --> 05:22.084
So... come on.

05:22.725 --> 05:23.925
Go to your room.

05:25.422 --> 05:27.456
I'm not gonna ask you twice.

05:29.326 --> 05:30.592
Except this once.

05:32.748 --> 05:34.296
So...

05:34.616 --> 05:36.252
at your leisure...

05:38.003 --> 05:39.434
to your room.

05:48.477 --> 05:49.622
Oh, hey, Care Bear.

05:49.647 --> 05:52.281
- I was just about to masturbate.
How goes it with you? - Oh.

05:52.822 --> 05:55.155
I think we made a
mistake having the twins.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.585
What?

05:56.687 --> 05:58.620
Of course I'm happy we had them.

05:58.722 --> 06:01.557
There are just so many
things I never considered.

06:01.659 --> 06:02.558
What do you mean?

06:02.660 --> 06:04.252
Well, I was so focused

06:04.281 --> 06:06.214
on step one of repopulation

06:06.316 --> 06:09.798
that I completely
ignored the next 50 steps.

06:09.823 --> 06:11.186
I mean, think about it.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.375
There are three little
girls in this world

06:13.400 --> 06:15.510
and just one little boy.

06:15.573 --> 06:17.225
Don't you think you're
jumping the gun here?

06:17.327 --> 06:19.260
I mean, the twins are, like, a week old.

06:19.362 --> 06:21.563
It's just Jasper gave Dawn flowers,

06:21.665 --> 06:25.266
and now Erica's talking about
them getting married, and...

06:25.368 --> 06:27.101
I don't know, I just...

06:27.204 --> 06:29.270
want our girls to be happy, you know?

06:29.372 --> 06:31.372
I want them to be able
to find in someone else

06:31.475 --> 06:33.141
what I found in you.

06:33.243 --> 06:34.542
Hey, I do, too.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.145
But things like this
are out of our control.

06:37.877 --> 06:39.347
You sure about that?

06:39.449 --> 06:40.482
Carol...

06:40.584 --> 06:42.417
I'm not gonna force anything.

06:42.519 --> 06:44.595
That's Erica's deal.

06:44.620 --> 06:48.789
I'm just gonna sit back and
help nature take its course.

06:49.758 --> 06:52.126
Don't you mean let
nature take its course?

06:52.229 --> 06:54.128
Yeah. That's what I said.

06:54.231 --> 06:56.364
I'm gonna let nature take its course.

06:56.808 --> 06:58.775
Hey, Jasper.

06:58.894 --> 07:00.961
Got a minute?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.153
You and I haven't spent a lot

07:08.178 --> 07:09.477
of quality time together lately

07:09.512 --> 07:12.003
so I thought we could
catch up over lunch.

07:12.028 --> 07:13.672
Oh, look.

07:13.697 --> 07:16.164
There's an open seat across
from Mike and Bezequille.

07:16.189 --> 07:16.999
Hmm.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.149
You are gonna love this meal.

07:23.251 --> 07:25.218
I took all your favorite things,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.887
macaroni and spray cheese

07:27.989 --> 07:30.790
and ketchup and Pop Tarts,

07:30.892 --> 07:34.539
and I mashed them all together
into one special casserole.

07:39.254 --> 07:40.387
So...

07:40.412 --> 07:41.911
where to begin?

07:41.936 --> 07:45.086
Oh, how about a general
discussion of the flora

07:45.111 --> 07:48.174
and fauna of coastal Mexico? Hmm? Hmm?

07:48.276 --> 07:50.209
Oh, no.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.595
Would you look at that?

07:52.620 --> 07:55.047
I completely forgot I
have a prior engagement

07:55.072 --> 07:57.770
that directly conflicts with this lunch.

07:57.795 --> 08:00.086
You three will have
to continue without me.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.821
No-no-no-no-no, no.

08:01.923 --> 08:03.089
Don't get up. Stay.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.924
Eat.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.093
Get to know each other.

08:19.307 --> 08:20.973
What's going on here?

08:20.998 --> 08:22.264
Um, you know, I thought

08:22.289 --> 08:26.045
it was only fair that the twins
get some face time, too, so...

08:26.867 --> 08:28.523
You know, I'm actually
happy you're here,

08:28.548 --> 08:32.083
because we should probably
figure out a schedule.

08:32.186 --> 08:33.562
A schedule?

08:33.587 --> 08:35.087
Yeah, you know, so Jasper's time

08:35.188 --> 08:37.943
isn't monopolized by any one baby.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.717
You're talking about three newborns

08:39.818 --> 08:41.619
and a nine to 11-year-old boy.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.506
We can't set them up on dates.

08:43.530 --> 08:46.991
But it's perfectly reasonable
for you to plan Dawn's wedding?

08:47.093 --> 08:48.926
You know what, you do
whatever you want to do,

08:49.028 --> 08:51.129
just leave me and Dawn out of it.

08:51.154 --> 08:52.663
If that's what you want.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.065
Yeah.

09:00.043 --> 09:01.839
And then there were two.

09:02.378 --> 09:04.323
Well, Carol is officially

09:04.348 --> 09:05.414
off her trolley.

09:05.439 --> 09:07.151
I just caught her Parent Trapping

09:07.176 --> 09:08.646
Jasper and the twins.

09:08.748 --> 09:09.847
She even tried to get me to agree

09:09.949 --> 09:11.749
to some sort of dating schedule.

09:11.851 --> 09:13.751
- What? No way.
- Yeah.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.586
It's like that silly
little comment I made

09:15.688 --> 09:17.621
about Dawn marrying
Jasper freaked her out.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.523
And you know how she
gets all Carol'd away.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.659
- Yeah, I got some idea.
- I was just so shocked.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.894
I walked away, but I feel
like maybe I should go back

09:23.996 --> 09:25.663
and say something, right?

09:26.094 --> 09:27.129
Shoog,

09:28.232 --> 09:30.265
I've been on this planet a long time,

09:30.589 --> 09:33.704
and I figured out a
couple of universal truths.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.707
One, you cannot domesticate a raccoon.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.877
I don't care how smart
you think that raccoon is.

09:39.979 --> 09:42.580
It's just not happening. And two,

09:42.682 --> 09:45.324
you cannot use logic

09:45.349 --> 09:48.386
to win an argument with Carol Pilbasian.

09:48.411 --> 09:50.754
So just don't let her suck you in.

09:50.857 --> 09:53.557
Yeah, I might be
overthinking this, but, like,

09:53.659 --> 09:55.860
what if her crazy plan somehow
works and Dawn ends up alone

09:55.962 --> 09:58.596
- for the rest of her life
because I didn't... - Erica.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.932
Do not let her suck you in.

10:02.947 --> 10:04.023
Yeah.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.872
Limbo.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.851
♪ How low can you go? ♪

10:09.876 --> 10:12.643
Oh, Bezequille, cleared it.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.645
Way to go. Awesome.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.747
Okay, your turn, Jasper.

10:16.849 --> 10:19.106
♪ How low can you go? ♪

10:19.131 --> 10:20.895
♪ How low can you go?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.920
♪ How low can you go? ♪

10:23.116 --> 10:25.883
♪ How low can you go? ♪

10:29.575 --> 10:31.752
Peso for your thoughtitos, bud.

10:31.777 --> 10:33.664
You think I'm a pushover, Tandy?

10:33.766 --> 10:37.635
What? With your meaty thighs
and low center of gravity?

10:37.737 --> 10:38.800
No way.

10:38.825 --> 10:39.970
Nah, it's just...

10:40.072 --> 10:41.839
I've been trying to discipline Jasper,

10:41.941 --> 10:43.807
but he won't listen to a thing I say.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.540
I mean, yesterday, I
told him he was grounded

10:46.565 --> 10:48.789
and he just kind of ignored me.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.948
I buckled like a pilgrim's hat.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.017
Look, bud, as someone
who's been in the Dad game

10:53.119 --> 10:55.693
for over 100 hours, I can tell you

10:55.780 --> 10:58.848
that being a parent is rock hard, okay?

10:58.873 --> 11:01.650
But if you'd like, I could
give you some pointeroos.

11:01.752 --> 11:02.751
Would you, bud?

11:02.854 --> 11:05.443
Try to friggin' stop me, huh?

11:05.468 --> 11:08.542
Okay, so, uh, look, you
be Jasper, I'll be you.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.759
So, uh, say something Jasper would say.

11:11.807 --> 11:12.960
Hmm.

11:14.972 --> 11:16.709
Yeah, I'm really drawing
a blank here, bud.

11:16.734 --> 11:17.766
Yeah.

11:17.869 --> 11:20.400
Hmm, oh, is he, uh, a cookie eater?

11:20.425 --> 11:21.770
Yeah, as much as the next guy, I guess.

11:21.873 --> 11:23.672
Good. So, say, "I want a cookie."

11:23.774 --> 11:24.773
I want a cookie.

11:24.876 --> 11:26.796
Well, you can't have a cookie, right?

11:26.821 --> 11:27.710
End of discussion.

11:27.735 --> 11:29.397
Now go to bed without
brushing your teeth. Come on.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.647
- Hey, but I want a cookie.
- Well, uh,

11:31.749 --> 11:33.476
I'm not gonna say it again, all right?

11:33.501 --> 11:34.850
JK, here it comes. No cookies.

11:34.952 --> 11:36.725
But I really want a...

11:37.293 --> 11:38.192
No cookies!

11:38.217 --> 11:41.270
I said no cookies, right?!

11:41.295 --> 11:43.803
And when I tell you
what to do, you do it!

11:43.828 --> 11:46.862
Because I am the adult,
and you are but a child!

11:46.964 --> 11:48.631
Okay, calm down.

11:48.656 --> 11:50.599
You don't tell me what to do, mister!

11:50.701 --> 11:52.994
I'm older than you, I
know, I've learned things.

11:53.019 --> 11:54.252
I went to college.

11:54.277 --> 11:55.704
I know stuff. Okay?

11:55.806 --> 11:57.840
And it makes me sad when
you treat me like this.

11:57.942 --> 11:59.842
It's a bummer! All right?

11:59.944 --> 12:02.933
I'm probably gonna cry
tonight, and that's on you!

12:02.958 --> 12:04.383
That's on you!

12:04.408 --> 12:05.614
Now I need you to go to your

12:05.731 --> 12:07.133
featherdrubbin' room

12:07.158 --> 12:09.961
and get in your least
favorite pair of jammies.

12:09.986 --> 12:12.211
And I swear to God,

12:12.236 --> 12:14.365
if I even catch you
thinking about cookies,

12:14.390 --> 12:16.836
I am gonna smash your
little bones into dust,

12:16.861 --> 12:19.450
and then I'm gonna make
that dust into a broth,

12:19.475 --> 12:21.664
and then I'm gonna
slurp it down, laughing.

12:25.858 --> 12:27.770
And you'll be inside of me.

12:28.410 --> 12:30.773
And I will poo you out.

12:32.537 --> 12:33.603
So what do you think?

12:33.660 --> 12:35.276
It's maybe a little harsh.

12:35.301 --> 12:36.612
Yeah, yeah, that's a good note.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.681
It's probably a little
strong for cookies.

12:38.783 --> 12:40.883
Eh, maybe more appropriate
for if-if he were

12:40.985 --> 12:43.539
to ever kill someone or
something like that, you know.

12:43.564 --> 12:45.633
But, uh, yeah, the main thing is,

12:45.658 --> 12:47.367
bet you're not thinking
about cookies, are ya?

12:47.392 --> 12:48.524
Not a bit, bud.

12:48.626 --> 12:49.825
I rest my caseload.

12:49.927 --> 12:52.828
Hey, bud, go get your Dad on.

12:53.617 --> 12:54.630
Thanks, bud.

12:59.459 --> 13:02.051
Okay, I'm just gonna
go ahead and say it.

13:02.076 --> 13:04.762
I think what you're doing with
Jasper and the twins is wrong.

13:04.787 --> 13:06.475
The matchmaking, the scheduling,

13:06.577 --> 13:08.602
- the makeup?
- Relax.

13:08.627 --> 13:10.460
I'm not doing that anymore.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.513
You're not?

13:11.538 --> 13:12.848
There's no need to.

13:12.950 --> 13:15.846
After you and Dawn officially bowed out,

13:15.871 --> 13:19.555
Jasper and the twins'
relationship just blossomed.

13:19.657 --> 13:20.823
Relationship?

13:20.925 --> 13:24.375
Yeah. It's totally taken
on a life of its own.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.695
It's like I'm barely a part of it now.

13:26.797 --> 13:29.478
He even gave each of
them a stuffed animal.

13:32.849 --> 13:35.483
Carol, are you just saying
this to get back at me?

13:35.508 --> 13:37.642
Why would I want to get back at you?

13:38.046 --> 13:39.508
None of this would've been possible

13:39.610 --> 13:41.543
if you hadn't pulled
Dawn out of the running.

13:41.646 --> 13:42.978
I'm just so thrilled that

13:43.080 --> 13:45.547
you didn't think Dawn having
romantic love in her life

13:45.650 --> 13:49.518
was that important, 'cause it
just made things so much easier.

13:50.425 --> 13:52.807
Oh. Being a mom, huh?

13:53.624 --> 13:54.990
You get it.

13:55.551 --> 13:58.661
Hey. Thank you, Erica.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.470
Let it go.

14:09.087 --> 14:11.674
Do not let her suck you in.

14:12.601 --> 14:13.552
Do not let her...

14:13.577 --> 14:16.109
Hey, Jasper.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.281
Got a minute?

14:22.987 --> 14:24.887
Wow.

14:24.923 --> 14:26.723
That looks like fun.

14:26.758 --> 14:28.024
You know what else is fun?

14:28.059 --> 14:29.859
Taking your time.

14:29.894 --> 14:31.273
Not being in a rush.

14:31.298 --> 14:33.763
You know, just being a kid.

14:33.798 --> 14:35.219
Look, you have your whole life

14:35.244 --> 14:37.560
ahead of you and so many options.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.495
I mean, Mike and Bezequille are great.

14:40.530 --> 14:41.863
And, obviously, Dawn's in the mix.

14:41.898 --> 14:45.021
She thinks you're fantastic,
by the way. Actually,

14:45.046 --> 14:47.544
it was her idea to
give you that go-kart.

I mean, you care to tell
me what you did wrong here,

15:29.149 --> 15:32.780
or would you like me
to let you know for me?

15:32.805 --> 15:34.778
- Okay.
- That doesn't answer the...

15:34.803 --> 15:35.835
Okay, you know what?

15:35.860 --> 15:37.968
I have tried being Mr. Nice Guy,

15:37.993 --> 15:41.051
but you have backed me into
a corner disciplinarially,

15:41.110 --> 15:43.107
and I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to start putting my foot down.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.174
That first foot's gonna start

15:44.210 --> 15:45.786
with this video game. Give me that.

15:45.811 --> 15:47.444
It's mine now.

15:49.557 --> 15:50.548
That's right!

15:50.573 --> 15:52.082
You march straight to your room, mister.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.084
Uh, excuse me? Room's the other way.

15:56.195 --> 15:58.088
Y-Yeah, good, take the long way.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.220
Give you plenty of time to
think about what you done.

16:01.245 --> 16:03.211
God, I suck at this!

16:07.421 --> 16:08.365
Hey, bud.

16:08.994 --> 16:10.660
Is something wrong?

16:13.705 --> 16:15.771
What was that all about?

16:15.796 --> 16:17.241
What was what all about?

16:17.276 --> 16:19.176
I thought you were done matchmaking.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.211
And I thought you
weren't getting involved.

16:21.247 --> 16:24.093
I'm only getting involved to
cancel out your involvement.

16:24.118 --> 16:26.050
So, the involvement canceler

16:26.085 --> 16:27.750
becomes the involvement cancelee.

16:27.775 --> 16:30.020
- What does that even mean?
- Where the heck is Tandy?

16:30.056 --> 16:31.355
We're a little busy right now.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.289
Someone call my name?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.391
You. Thanks for the advice.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.683
- You're welcome, bud. How'd it go?
- Great.

16:36.708 --> 16:39.029
I tried to put my foot down.
It landed squarely in my mouth.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.431
- Oh, bud.
- No,

16:40.466 --> 16:42.199
don't "oh, bud" me. Jasper hates me now.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.301
- Thanks a lot.
- Could you guys wrap it up?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.136
Carol and I were fighting in here first.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.204
You know what? On that subject,

16:47.239 --> 16:48.372
I've got a bone to pick with you,

16:48.407 --> 16:50.107
Ms. Go-Kart Enabler.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.142
Ooh, yes, that is dirty poker.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.078
I can't let a young man drive a car

16:54.113 --> 16:56.213
specifically designed for young men?

16:56.248 --> 16:58.182
No, not when that young man is grounded.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.351
You didn't quite put your
foot down enough, huh, bud?

17:00.386 --> 17:01.985
I put it down very hard!

17:02.021 --> 17:03.354
Let's just keep it down.
The twins are sleeping.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.089
Oh, they're probably exhausted

17:05.124 --> 17:07.257
from their speed dating session today.

17:07.292 --> 17:09.359
Dawn speed dated, too, Erica.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.362
I told you not to go and get sucked in.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.464
I do not need to be
patronized right now, Gail.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.132
Listen to Mom, Mom.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.983
I think you're acting
like a nutjob, too.

17:17.008 --> 17:18.842
- Mom?!
- Oh, if you're looking

17:18.867 --> 17:21.137
for nutjobs, I know a place
where you can find one.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.306
You did not just say that.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.174
- Yes, I did.
- How dare you!

17:25.781 --> 17:27.089
That's where I draw the line!

17:27.115 --> 17:28.212
Idiots.

17:28.801 --> 17:29.833
Guys.

17:30.185 --> 17:32.249
Guys!

17:32.284 --> 17:34.761
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Melissa, can this wait?

17:34.786 --> 17:36.631
Every single one of us is
in the middle of something.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.322
No, it cannot.

17:38.347 --> 17:40.347
Do you guys realize what you're doing?

17:40.372 --> 17:41.358
There is a little boy out there

17:41.394 --> 17:43.792
who's confused and freaked
out because all the people

17:43.817 --> 17:46.029
he thinks he can trust
in the world are acting

17:46.065 --> 17:47.775
like raving lunatics.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.744
Guys, he is a nine to 11-year-old boy.

17:50.776 --> 17:54.072
Melissa, he's not just a
nine to 11-year-old boy,

17:54.097 --> 17:57.033
He's the last nine to 11-year-old boy.

17:57.058 --> 17:59.009
And that changes everything.

17:59.452 --> 18:01.178
Only if we let it.

18:01.562 --> 18:05.082
Look, Jasper is never gonna
have a normal childhood.

18:05.768 --> 18:07.935
Okay, he's never gonna go to school

18:07.960 --> 18:09.052
or play Little League

18:09.088 --> 18:13.855
or-or have a crush on a girl
he hasn't known since birth.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.093
And yeah, he doesn't
know what he's missing.

18:16.409 --> 18:17.818
But we do.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.268
And that's why we have
to make sure we give him

18:20.293 --> 18:23.227
just a piece of the childhood
that was taken from him.

18:25.253 --> 18:27.404
Maybe we can start with an apology.

18:32.620 --> 18:35.179
Jasper, we're so sorry...

18:37.962 --> 18:39.951
Oh, farts.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.203
Jasper!

18:43.100 --> 18:44.317
Oh! There he is.

18:44.342 --> 18:45.884
- JK. Bad time.
- Come on.

18:45.909 --> 18:48.109
- Jasper!
- Jasper!

18:50.877 --> 18:52.471
This is all my fault.

18:52.682 --> 18:54.333
- Don't say that, bud.
- No.

18:54.358 --> 18:56.191
The way I was acting was so off-brand.

18:56.293 --> 18:58.126
That wasn't me, and I
should have known better.

18:58.229 --> 19:00.796
Bud, this isn't on you.

19:00.821 --> 19:02.718
This is on me, right?

19:02.808 --> 19:06.576
As the de facto and basically
facto leader of this group,

19:06.678 --> 19:08.687
I should've given you better advice.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.614
Right, you don't get mad at the sheep.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.359
Get mad at the shepherd.

19:12.781 --> 19:14.551
Thanks, bud.

19:14.576 --> 19:15.608
Hey.

19:15.912 --> 19:17.333
Little friendship kiss?

19:17.536 --> 19:19.789
Of course.

19:19.891 --> 19:21.925
That's the stuff.

19:22.027 --> 19:23.827
Jasper!

19:25.831 --> 19:26.896
- Jasper!
- Jasper!

19:26.999 --> 19:29.566
Jasper!

19:29.668 --> 19:31.835
Jasper!

19:33.690 --> 19:34.771
I'm so sorry.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.740
This is all my fault.

19:36.779 --> 19:38.545
No, it's mine.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.810
I totally lost my mind today.

19:41.221 --> 19:44.228
Just kept imagining
Dawn all alone, and...

19:44.253 --> 19:45.615
I snapped.

19:45.717 --> 19:48.313
Motherhood makes you
do some crazy stuff.

19:48.338 --> 19:49.786
I once punched a mom

19:49.888 --> 19:51.054
'cause she asked if my kid's pants

19:51.156 --> 19:53.206
were from Mervyn's.

19:53.354 --> 19:55.992
She meant it as a compliment, but...

19:56.464 --> 19:58.315
it just set me off.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.864
- Full disclosure, they were.
- Hmm.

20:01.222 --> 20:03.066
Point is...

20:03.831 --> 20:05.835
your kids are your life.

20:08.672 --> 20:10.774
We'll find him.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.681
You hear that?

20:17.783 --> 20:18.815
It must be Jasper.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.651
Yeah.

20:45.761 --> 20:47.844
Well, it's definitely
coming from in there.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.281
We found him.
