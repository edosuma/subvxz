17:27.171 --> 17:30.216
Oh, shit. I totally forgot. I'm so sorry.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.929
- It's okay.
- Can we maybe do it tomorrow?

17:34.012 --> 17:36.264
- Yeah. Sure, tomorrow works.
- Yeah.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.474
Is everything okay?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.935
Yeah. I got a lot of stuff to do.
I'll call you later.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.687
You know I gotta ask you this.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.237
- A tip-off?
- Any way your brother could have known--

17:51.446 --> 17:54.032
No. I don't talk
to my family about work.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.909
You spoken to him
since you discovered this?

17:56.117 --> 17:58.369
I came straight to you, Clay.

17:58.954 --> 18:02.081
You understand what it means
if we find this on your family's property?

18:06.711 --> 18:08.379
I'm coming to you, Clay.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.216
It's grounds for asset seizures.
Maybe RICO charges.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.094
I'm coming to you, Clay,
to get ahead of any of that.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.347
I'm telling you what I found
as soon as I found it.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.808
The rest of my family
have nothing to do with this. I know that.

18:19.975 --> 18:21.726
It won't matter.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.230
We find narcotics
on your family's property,

18:26.314 --> 18:28.274
we have to investigate.
You know that.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.319
[sighs]

18:33.363 --> 18:37.241
I understand that. I understand that.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.161
Obviously, you can't be
working the Lowry case.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.000
Lowry and the cocaine.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.337
And my brother, it's all yours. I get it.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.216
I'll get a team together.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.511
Let's go get your brother.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.349
Hey. You going out on the boat?

19:01.558 --> 19:03.852
Yeah, maybe later.
Why? You wanna come?

19:05.020 --> 19:06.229
I can't.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.647
Oh.

19:07.731 --> 19:11.359
- Maybe another time.
- What's going on with you and my dad?

19:12.861 --> 19:14.071
What do you mean?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.614
He told me and Ben
we're not supposed to see you.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.084
Brothers.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.920
Can I have a cigarette?

19:33.381 --> 19:35.550
I do it with my friends all the time.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.261
Yeah. Okay.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.151
What'd you do to him?

19:54.193 --> 19:58.115
Uh, your dad? It's a very good question.

19:58.322 --> 20:02.869
He always thinks he's
so much better than you. But he's not.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.375
Maybe someday he'll realize that.

20:15.673 --> 20:21.138
Until then, though, you should stay away
from me. You don't know what I'll do.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.141
Scary Uncle Danny.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.350
[laughs]

20:27.435 --> 20:29.062
Yeah.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.564
Danny, don't.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.483

Oh, look who it is.

21:17.152 --> 21:21.031
There's a car waiting for you
out by the gate. You need to go get in.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.908
DEA has some questions for you.

21:24.575 --> 21:29.873
Like, ask me questions about my brother
leaking details of the investigation?

21:31.041 --> 21:34.878
Maybe. But I doubt they're
gonna believe your answer

21:34.961 --> 21:37.463
because it's gonna be
my word against yours.

21:42.093 --> 21:46.973
You can go get in the car or I can have
them come drag you out. It's your choice.

21:47.057 --> 21:49.184
Mm...

21:52.979 --> 21:54.981
[door buzzes]

21:55.773 --> 22:00.070

22:03.031 --> 22:04.199
Okay.

The DEA needs to talk to you.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.607
- Why?
- Right now, Meg.

22:38.942 --> 22:40.610
Is that John?

22:41.778 --> 22:44.072
DEA wants to talk to me.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.739
I'm not sure.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.118
How'd you know what it was?

23:31.286 --> 23:34.164
I guess I didn't know for sure,
but it's...

23:34.497 --> 23:38.335
It was white powder in packages, so...

23:39.418 --> 23:40.795
How much was there?

23:41.004 --> 23:44.757
I don't know. I don't know
how to count it. It was a lot.

23:44.924 --> 23:49.053
It was suitcases full of it. I didn't know
what to do, so I just called John.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.724
And then I guess he called you.
That's all I really know.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.571
[door buzzes]

24:10.950 --> 24:13.494
I told them everything I know.

Okay.

24:18.541 --> 24:21.752
- I didn't do anything--
- I wouldn't say anything right now.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.921
I'll talk to Marco.

25:19.102 --> 25:24.732
Yeah, it just seems like a lot of fuss
and bother about nothing, really.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.945
[John] How the hell could you
release him, Clay?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.988
I can't hold him on
what I've got. You know that.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.909
Danny must've moved the drugs
before you picked him up.

25:35.118 --> 25:37.328
- You gotta keep an eye on him.
- [Clay] We will.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.789
He's our closest lead to Lowry.
And I know him.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.750
He's gonna fuck up eventually
and give us what we need.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.878
Look, I got no reason
to think your sister's lying.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.506
But none of this feels right.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.592
It doesn't to me either, Clay.
Look, I--

25:52.635 --> 25:55.263
I tried to get ahead of a bad situation.

25:55.346 --> 25:58.433

I'm about a thousand miles behind.

Where are you right now?

26:13.906 --> 26:15.533
- I'm at the boat.
- Where's Meg?

26:15.741 --> 26:19.829
Um, I don't know.
She's not here yet. How'd she do?

26:19.912 --> 26:23.541
She did fine.
Everything's going as planned.

26:23.624 --> 26:26.461
Okay, so what do we do now?

26:26.669 --> 26:29.713
Listen, Kevin, I don't want you
to do anything. Just wait for me.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.717
John, I'm sitting here with a fuck-load
of illegal shit in my boatyard.

26:33.801 --> 26:36.137
I have no idea how this
is supposed to work.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.055
Kevin, goddamn it. Listen to me closely.

26:38.139 --> 26:41.184
Don't do a goddamn thing
until I get there.

26:41.851 --> 26:45.062
Please. You're just gonna
have to keep trusting me on this.

26:45.146 --> 26:47.731
Fine. Goodbye.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.484
- Who was that?
- John.

26:49.692 --> 26:52.028
He wants us to wait. Fuck!

26:54.864 --> 26:58.326
Meg, what are we doing?
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

26:58.868 --> 27:02.746
Everything's gonna be fine.
John knows what he's doing.

I wondered what you meant
when you said

27:41.702 --> 27:44.414
that you were gonna take
the family down with you.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.586
Didn't quite turn out
that way, though, did it?

27:49.668 --> 27:51.879
Family's in the clear.

27:52.713 --> 27:55.132
DEA didn't find anything in there.

27:57.594 --> 27:59.303
But they're still after you, Danny.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.306
What did you do with it all?

28:03.099 --> 28:07.061
It's in the water. Bottom of the ocean.

28:07.144 --> 28:09.939
Then I got bigger problems
than the DEA.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.899
Wayne Lowry.

28:12.108 --> 28:16.112
Not gonna be very happy,
he finds out his shed is empty.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.989
He may even send
someone to hurt me.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.200
I'd run.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.787
Be smart and get out of town.

28:25.913 --> 28:28.332
Is that what this is all about?

28:28.707 --> 28:32.545
You just want me gone. You don't care
whether anything happens to me?

28:32.629 --> 28:34.380
Hey, it's not my problem.

28:34.589 --> 28:36.715
Not your fucking problem.

You know what? You're no longer
my fucking problem, Danny.

28:41.178 --> 28:45.349
Wanna know when that happened?
For real?

28:46.058 --> 28:48.811
Right after Sarah died.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.857
That's when you
washed your hands of me.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.694
I'm taking you to the bus stop tonight.

28:57.612 --> 28:59.656
Do you know what killed her?

29:01.031 --> 29:04.827
The necklace. That's all it was.

29:08.414 --> 29:13.169
Dropped it in the sea, went in after it.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.673
A little seahorse.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.550
As soon as she put it on,
she was already dead.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.470
Oh, it had nothing to do with you.

29:22.679 --> 29:26.724
- Here we go. The fucking blame again.
- You shouldn't have been out with her.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.892
But you should have.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.398
But you wouldn't come.

29:35.566 --> 29:38.027
You were too scared
of breaking the fucking rules.

I was just trying to
make her feel better.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.995

No one gave a damn.

You stay here,

29:52.166 --> 29:54.126
You go right fucking ahead.
I don't care.

Either that or you come
to the bus station with me.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.964
It's your fucking choice.

Doesn't answer, hasn't called.

Don't give up on him yet.
Give him another hour.

30:34.709 --> 30:38.128
- Then what?
- Then do what you have to.

30:43.718 --> 30:47.638

have stayed focused.

37:39.091 --> 37:41.218
You know, we'll work it out.
But let's go.

37:41.426 --> 37:45.347
- I'm so sorry for all the interruptions.
- Mom, I really don't wanna go anyway.

37:46.140 --> 37:48.100
Your aunt is getting married.
It's important.

37:48.184 --> 37:49.185
[Ben]
Dad, I can't.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.978
- [John] All right. I'll do it.
- Sorry. Yes.

37:51.061 --> 37:54.356
You can water them, only a little bit.
Please keep them out of the sun.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.026
Well, look who it is.

37:59.528 --> 38:01.697
This is a nice surprise.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.657
I heard about what happened.

38:03.740 --> 38:06.326
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.829
- You sure?
- Wrist acts up sometimes.

38:09.038 --> 38:10.372
But really, I'm fine.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.582
[Belle sighs]

38:14.877 --> 38:17.546
Let's go over here.
We can talk over here.

38:18.172 --> 38:20.507
[Belle] Are you sure you're okay?
I keep trying to call you--

38:20.590 --> 38:23.135
- [Kevin] I've been busy.
- Your voicemail is full.

38:23.219 --> 38:26.096
Busy times. Come on.
What's new? What's going on?

38:26.180 --> 38:27.556
What's going on in your world?

38:29.391 --> 38:31.268
Actually...

38:31.351 --> 38:33.395
- I'm taking a trip.
- Really?

38:33.603 --> 38:36.439
Cool. I need a vacation myself. Heh.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.441
- I'm gonna stay at my sister's...
-Yeah?

38:38.525 --> 38:40.694
- ...in Orlando.
- How long?

38:42.362 --> 38:45.115
I'm thinking of moving there.

38:48.493 --> 38:49.703
Well...

38:49.786 --> 38:53.331
Are you gonna sell the house?

38:53.540 --> 38:55.333
I need a change.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.088
Okay.

38:59.922 --> 39:04.927
I'm gonna get a job and
see if it's something I wanna do.

39:05.135 --> 39:07.763
That's good. Change is good.

39:10.933 --> 39:12.726
It's all good.

39:15.478 --> 39:18.690
- I gotta get back to the grind.
- Okay.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.236
- All right. Take care. You, too.
- Take care.

39:22.319 --> 39:24.196
You look great.

39:30.911 --> 39:32.913
[♪♪♪]

39:46.135 --> 39:50.347
- You can't take her without an adult.
- We're the only fucking adults here.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.682
Come with us.

39:52.891 --> 39:53.934
Danny, don't.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.602
[boat engine revving]

39:55.811 --> 39:58.688
She needs to be with an adult.

40:06.822 --> 40:08.406
[knocking]

40:10.784 --> 40:14.579
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Sure. Come on in.

40:26.383 --> 40:28.718
There are things
you aren't telling me, John.

40:29.427 --> 40:33.556
We both know whose voice is on that tape,
and who's on the video with O'Bannon.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.476
You were trying to protect Danny.

40:37.227 --> 40:39.062
I get it.

40:39.938 --> 40:43.025
He's your brother. It's complicated.

40:45.277 --> 40:48.697
That's why I was willing
to let you take the lead, but...

40:53.702 --> 40:56.038
What about these girls, huh?

40:57.164 --> 40:59.375
Vicente Cruz lost a daughter,
you remember?

41:06.215 --> 41:09.551
- Yeah. I do.
- So where are we with this?

41:12.721 --> 41:17.684
[John] It's your case now. I'll help you
as much as I can behind the scenes.

41:18.518 --> 41:19.811
But you gotta take the lead.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.776
- [Diana] That dress is nice.
- That was Janey's favorite.

41:27.027 --> 41:28.362
Where is she anyway?

41:29.321 --> 41:32.615
John's dropping her off
so she's bound to be three hours late.

41:33.367 --> 41:37.413
In that case, I'm gonna have some coffee.
Do you all want some?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.248
- No. I'm good.
- Oh, God. Yes. Please.

41:39.331 --> 41:41.375
- [laughs] Double espresso?
- Please.

41:41.583 --> 41:42.876
- [Sally] Okay.
- Oh, wow.

41:43.252 --> 41:45.379
These gowns are awful.

41:45.462 --> 41:49.383
I'm really only here for my mom.
Well, and Janey, too.

41:49.466 --> 41:51.801
But I am not even sure
there's gonna be a wedding.

41:53.303 --> 41:57.849
- What? What are you talking about?
- I fucked up with Marco.

41:57.933 --> 42:00.269
Really? What happened?

42:00.477 --> 42:02.145
I'll tell you later.

42:02.229 --> 42:03.730
Here you are.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.358
[phone buzzing]

42:09.027 --> 42:10.446
Hey. It's me.

42:11.488 --> 42:14.657
- Where are you?
- I'm at the office. Where are you?

42:14.866 --> 42:18.578
- You're supposed to be picking up Janey.
- What?

42:18.661 --> 42:21.623
We're here waiting for her.
We talked about this this morning.

42:21.831 --> 42:23.708
Oh, shit. I forgot.

42:23.792 --> 42:26.169
No, I'm leaving now.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.089
Hurry.

42:29.298 --> 42:32.717
She ran into me and she dropped it.
I was like, "Are you kidding me?"

42:32.801 --> 42:35.720
And then I got so freaked out.
And then my dad found out.

42:35.804 --> 42:37.639
Hey, Sophie.

42:38.348 --> 42:40.392
Oh, hey, Mr. Rayburn. How's it going?

42:40.600 --> 42:43.270
Hey, kiddo. How you doing?
Have you seen Janey around?

42:43.437 --> 42:45.021
I think she already got picked up.

42:45.688 --> 42:48.066
Oh, Ben must've gotten her.
All right. Thank you.

42:48.275 --> 42:50.944
Oh, wait, actually, no.
I thought it was you.

42:52.237 --> 42:53.405
Why would you think that?

42:53.571 --> 42:56.908
It was a guy in the truck and she said
you were coming to get her.

42:58.368 --> 43:01.830
- What kind of truck?
- Um, a pick-up, but, like, old.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.249
- Black?
- Yeah. I think so.

43:13.133 --> 43:15.135
[phone ringing]

43:15.718 --> 43:17.762
It's your dad.

43:18.972 --> 43:21.517
- Wanna talk to him?
- Not really.

43:21.724 --> 43:25.395
Well, maybe you should.
He's probably worried about you.

43:25.521 --> 43:27.772
[Janey on recording]
It's Janey. Leave me a message.

43:27.856 --> 43:30.066
Janey, it's Dad.
Call me when you get this.

43:30.150 --> 43:33.320
I'm not fucking around.
You call me as soon as you get this.

43:33.403 --> 43:35.405
[♪♪♪]

43:37.073 --> 43:38.741

43:42.745 --> 43:43.830
[line rings]

43:43.913 --> 43:46.624
- [Gwen] Rayburn house.
- Gwen, have you seen Danny today?

43:46.833 --> 43:48.793
A while ago. He was here with Janey.

43:48.918 --> 43:49.961
What do you mean, "was"?
Where are they now?

43:50.170 --> 43:54.007
They went out on the boat. He said
not to worry. Janey's with an adult.

43:54.216 --> 43:56.843
Listen, as soon as you see them,
you give me a call.

43:56.926 --> 44:00.347
Do you understand?
You call me immediately.

44:06.436 --> 44:07.812
[Janey]
It's nice out here.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.942
Yeah.

44:15.028 --> 44:17.489
What a place to grow up, huh?

44:18.574 --> 44:20.075
I guess.

44:21.951 --> 44:23.245
[John]
This is Detective John Rayburn.

44:23.328 --> 44:25.914
I wanna put out a BOLO alert
on a missing child.

44:25.997 --> 44:28.542
Age 15. Caucasian.

44:28.625 --> 44:32.170
Name is Jane B. Rayburn.

44:32.254 --> 44:37.884
Hundred and fifteen pounds,
brown hair. Five foot, six inches.

44:39.135 --> 44:41.012
[Marco]
You know where we're headed?

44:41.638 --> 44:43.723
[John]
I got a good idea.

44:47.936 --> 44:49.938
[♪♪♪]

44:57.613 --> 44:58.863
I got you a present.

45:00.115 --> 45:01.241
What for?

45:02.867 --> 45:05.412
Because I felt bad
about missing your birthday.

45:05.870 --> 45:06.871
What'd you get me?

45:06.955 --> 45:08.915
Haven't decided
if I'm gonna give it to you yet.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.793
Oh, my God. What a tease.

45:12.001 --> 45:14.003
- You can't do that.
- Well, maybe later.

45:14.087 --> 45:16.172
Something to look forward to.

45:16.548 --> 45:18.592
- You going in?
- Yeah. You coming?

- We found the boat.

47:26.511 --> 47:30.348
She was off Big Torch.
We're bringing her in.

47:30.432 --> 47:32.350
Should be here in about 30.

47:32.684 --> 47:34.770
Give us the location.

47:35.478 --> 47:38.981

out there with her.

I took the bus all the way to Miami.
Then I thought, "fuck it." So I came back.

- Just to be home.
