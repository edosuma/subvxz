WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.007
No, I'm--

00:08.509 --> 00:10.219
I'm worried you're gonna get hurt.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.803
It'll be fine.

00:11.887 --> 00:16.433
Jason, you can't just cycle to work
like it's nothing. This isn't Amsterdam.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.561
No, it's not.
Otherwise, you'd be way more chill.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.813
Jason, cycling is so dangerous.

00:21.897 --> 00:25.400
Cycling is dangerous, and it's boring.
How is that even possible?

00:25.484 --> 00:28.570
And that helmet is ten years old.
It's doing absolutely nothing.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.240
This? This is good as gold.
Don't worry about that.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.116
You look like Carmen Miranda.

00:33.909 --> 00:38.121
You're too cocky. It's always
the cocky people that have accidents.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.874
That's why I never sang
on the back of the school bus.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.584
-Or watch films on planes.
-Yeah.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.672
-No!
-Oi, Nikki.

00:47.673 --> 00:48.841
I'm worried.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.552
You said we need to do more for the
environment. This is for the environment.

00:51.635 --> 00:54.137
Yes, we are recycling kids.
That is enough.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.849
Oh, my God.
Please don't tell anyone I said that.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.744
Just be careful, okay?

01:17.828 --> 01:19.454
Trust me, I'll be fine.

01:20.998 --> 01:24.084
-What? Who's that from?
-It's from Maria.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.252
Who's that?

01:25.335 --> 01:28.338
The young girl-- The woman I sponsor.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.341
Honduras.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.802
-Jase. Every time.
-Yeah. What? Okay.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.053
Can you get the door for me, please?

01:35.137 --> 01:36.221
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

01:40.809 --> 01:44.021
Don't forget we're meeting Princess's
social worker at the school at 1:00.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.315
Both hands.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.609
I don't want us to relax just
because we've been selected for her.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.528
We could be un-selected.
That's just two letters different.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.655
-That's not gonna happen. Okay?
-Okay.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.240
All right. Love you.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.825
-Love you. Be careful.
-All right.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.372
-You all right?
-Yeah.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.708
The bloke in the shop
said there's a bit of a knack to it.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.668
Yeah, it's fine. All right.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.544
-Okay.
-See ya.

02:13.008 --> 02:16.261
I know he's only six,
but he was born with ears, wasn't he?

02:16.345 --> 02:17.429
Go on.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.143
-Hi there.
-Hi. Again.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.316
You've got... You--

02:29.399 --> 02:31.735
-It's your collar.
-What?

02:33.445 --> 02:35.697
-There you go.
-Thank you.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.373
What's this? What's going on here?

02:44.456 --> 02:47.417
-Nothing.
-He's nice. You like him?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.710
What? No.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.462
There's definitely something.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.047
I am engaged.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.591
Engaged, not married.
Looking's not buying.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.347
I am having unnatural thoughts.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.810
-Want me to find out his situation?
-Absolutely not.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.604
I've got a way.
I get them to draw their families.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.649
If they don't draw a mum,
then I know it's all to play for.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.068
Squeeze in a cheeky wax
before parents' evening.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.697
I am really, genuinely,
honestly not interested in him. Okay?

03:16.780 --> 03:17.781
No.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.784
One adverb too many. Now I'm sure.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.747
-Bye!
-Please keep listening.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.040
All right, love you.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.175
This could be
the first time she ever sees us.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.260
If she looks over at the right time.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.553
Is that why you're wearing a new dress?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.430
This? No, this is old.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.682
-It's still got the price tag on it.
-Oh, shit.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.936
-Jase.
-Careful.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.482
Oh, my God.
There's a drawer here for pine cones.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.903
When did we all stop
finding pine cones amazing?

03:55.986 --> 03:59.531
I'd say for me it was when the bra
made its first appearance, but--

04:02.367 --> 04:03.827
Hello. Disha.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.704
-Disha. How are ya?
-Hi, Disha.

04:05.787 --> 04:06.830
-Nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.916
This is Josie, Princess's form teacher.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.000
-Hello.
-Hello, Josie.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.629
-Hello. I see you found her seat.
-Yeah, are these all her drawings?

04:13.712 --> 04:18.382
She loves it. And we find it helps her
regulate her emotions, so--

04:18.759 --> 04:22.346
Right, so should we pop out?
Observe her in the wild?

04:22.429 --> 04:23.847
-Yeah. We'd love to.
-Okay, okay.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.850
Now, I know Penny will have said,
but it is worth mentioning again.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.894
It's important not to approach her.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.312
We don't want a meet at this stage.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.814
It just needs to be gradual
or it can jeopardize the adoption.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.024
Understood.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.776
Pretend you're visiting the school
on business.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.569
Okay. Like what?

04:39.696 --> 04:41.156
Well, anything you like.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.993
-How about surveyors? Yeah.
-Sure.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.745
-What we surveying?
-Let me think.

04:47.996 --> 04:48.997
Just the playground.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.168
Just gonna check to see if it's level.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.340
-That sounds good to me. Shall we?
-Yeah.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.219
If we're being other people,
should we do accents?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.179
-Which ones can you do?
-I can do American.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.723
-Show me.
-Well, howdy, partner--

05:06.807 --> 05:08.684
I'm gonna stop you right there.
It's absolutely perfect.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.353
Just a couple of Texan surveyors over
to see whether the playground is level.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.437
Happens every day.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.910
-This is a good surface. Yeah.
-Yeah, garden area thing.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.996
And that looks--

05:29.913 --> 05:30.998
-Very sturdy.
-Yeah.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.085
-Now, that's her there.
-Where is she now?

05:35.169 --> 05:36.336
See her? She's got the yellow ball.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.380
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.631
Oh, yeah.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.092
Over here, over here!

05:42.176 --> 05:45.262
She's got a lot of energy. Hasn't she?

05:46.346 --> 05:47.973
-Give it back!
-No! No!

05:48.056 --> 05:50.893
-Mason. Nicely, please.
-My ball.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.228
-Mason.
-Give it back.

05:53.312 --> 05:56.481
-Tyler. No pushing. No pushing.
-It's our ball.

05:56.565 --> 05:57.774
Wow.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.694
-He's handy for a little one.
-Tyler, that's her brother, isn't it?

06:00.777 --> 06:01.945
Yeah.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.156
-They're very protective of each other.
-Right.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.741
Do they know they're being
separated, Disha?

06:05.824 --> 06:07.159
-Yeah, they do.
-Yeah.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.786
Finding someone to take both
became impossible.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.997
I wish we could,
but we've only been approved for one.

06:12.080 --> 06:12.998
For one, yeah.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.210
Well, we'll obviously try and keep them
present in each other's lives.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.419
Give me the ball.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.841
Over here, over here.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.970
-That went well, I think.
-Yeah.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.597
Did it worry you a little bit

06:28.680 --> 06:30.766
when they said about her
needing to regulate her emotions?

06:30.849 --> 06:32.017
-With the drawing and--
-No.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.394
-No?
-No. We knew she was gonna need our help.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.271
To be honest, it'd be nice to try
and fix someone

06:36.355 --> 06:37.731
I'm not sleeping with for a change.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.566
I'm not sure that fixing is the right--

06:39.650 --> 06:40.817
-What?
-We need to return these.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.277
Oh, yeah. I'll wait here.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.779
Okay. Thank you.

06:52.621 --> 06:53.830
Hello?

06:56.333 --> 06:57.543
Hello?

07:04.508 --> 07:06.009
Settle down now.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.264
I said set-- Jessica, settle down.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.860
Thank you.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.445
Why, you're very welcome.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.369
The people who steal balls in playgrounds,

07:32.452 --> 07:34.121
this is their time. They've peaked.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.082
But your time is coming.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.918
And it will be longer.
And it will be better.

07:41.503 --> 07:45.048
Now, y'all
have a good day now, little missy.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.981
Thank you.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.238
Does that mean you've gotta do an accent
for the next 40 years now? Yeah?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.574
No, no, no. 'Cause I'm just gonna
phase it out gradually.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.535
It's just that they did say
very specifically not to talk to her.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.829
I know. I know,
but you didn't see her little face.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.372
Oh, my God.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.249
Are you gonna be
one of those helicopter parents?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.710
Yeah, the one who keeps
talking about choices

08:21.793 --> 08:23.378
and is really overprotective?

08:23.462 --> 08:26.507
Well, yeah. I was planning on protecting
our daughter, Jase. Yeah.

08:26.590 --> 08:30.260
No, you need to--
You need to trust people more, all right?

08:38.936 --> 08:40.604
-See you later.
-Bye.

08:43.649 --> 08:44.691
Keep to the left.

08:53.492 --> 08:56.828
What are you doing?
We're supposed to be doing ocean life.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.039
We're drawing our families, aren't we?

08:59.122 --> 09:04.086
So remember, draw anyone
who lives in your house. Anyone at all.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.380
Look at that.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.968
You've really thought about colors there,
Raina. Well done.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.515
Game on.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.483
That's a big house.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.111
Remind me, what was your dad's name again?

09:29.653 --> 09:30.821
Ron.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.365
Ron? Well, I'll be seeing him
at parents' evening.

09:49.882 --> 09:52.426
-Jase?
-No. I've gone. I'm away.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.053
You need to come back.
The Belarusians are kicking off again.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.222
-What?
-They won't sit next to the Russians,

09:57.306 --> 09:59.391
and the Russians won't move
'cause they're avoiding Mykola.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.351
-Why?
-He's Ukrainian.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.853
He brought the flag again.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.480
No, sorry. I've gone.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.357
-Look--
-Stick someone Swiss between them.

10:07.441 --> 10:11.778
We don't have any Swiss people!
They can afford better schools!

10:12.196 --> 10:13.238
Good luck.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.454
Okay.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.458
Hello.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.542
Hiya.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.339
-Oh, my God.
-It's fine, it's fine.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.508
-Everything is fine, okay?
-What's happened?

10:32.591 --> 10:35.469
-Nothing, okay?
-Jason, what happened?

10:35.552 --> 10:38.722
Look, I fell over the, what,
bike rack thing, okay?

10:38.805 --> 10:41.350
It is not serious.
It's more embarrassing than anything else.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.185
See? I told you you'd have an accident.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.395
It wasn't an accident. I've tripped over.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.524
You tripped over a bike rack.
It is a bike accident.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.235
If you sit on your car keys,
it's not a car accident, is it?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.361
It is okay.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.364
-All right, okay. Let me.
-Help me pull that off?

10:55.447 --> 10:57.449
-It's all right.
-Okay, sit down. I'll clean you up.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.952
All right. Honestly, I'm fine.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.620
Oh, bloody hell.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.122
See? That's why you shouldn't
be riding your bike. You're clumsy.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.874
It's a scratch. It's fine.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.461
-Yeah.
-Okay.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.505
It's all right.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.467
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

11:16.969 --> 11:21.181
Look, you-- You don't need to look
like that. Okay? It's not a big deal.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.183
Jase, it's a quarter of your face.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.102
That's half a normal person's face.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.523
What's what's-her-name have to say?

11:29.606 --> 11:31.525
-Maria!
-Maria, what's she saying?

11:31.608 --> 11:32.609
She sent me a photo.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.112
I was only just saying
I wish she'd send me a photo, wasn't I?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.238
Well, there you go.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.909
-Okay, let me see.
-What?

11:40.993 --> 11:43.579
-Let me see.
-Nah. It's-- What--

11:43.662 --> 11:45.289
-Jason!
-No. 'Cause what's happened--

11:45.372 --> 11:48.292
-I've fallen on the corner of it, okay?
-Oh, my God.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.336
-It's okay. All right.
-Go and get changed. I'll get some ice.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.256
And by the way,
why is Elliot texting me about Erica?

11:54.339 --> 11:56.633
-Oh, yeah. I set them up.
-What? Why?

11:56.717 --> 12:00.179
He's an idiot. He calls women "milady."

12:00.262 --> 12:03.182
He tries to find excuses to wear vest tops
so he can show off his arms.

12:03.265 --> 12:06.852
Yeah, no. I want an idiot.
She's not ready for anything serious.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.897
She needs a couple of idiots
to reject just, you know,

12:09.980 --> 12:11.815
to boost her confidence up a bit.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.026
Helicopter.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.152
Go and get changed.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.197
Jason, go and get changed.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.175
Watch it, mate.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.040
Just popping out!

13:10.123 --> 13:11.625
Where you going?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.210
To get some milk.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.628
Okay.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.311
Do you want a bike?

13:31.395 --> 13:33.063
Yeah, I'd proper love a bike.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.546
-I'm back!
-Hi.

13:57.629 --> 13:58.922
Hey.

14:05.304 --> 14:06.930
Where's the milk?

14:07.764 --> 14:09.391
They didn't have any milk.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.102
The supermarket didn't have any milk?

14:12.186 --> 14:13.896
No, they sold out.

14:17.191 --> 14:19.026
It's very popular, Jase.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.197
Oh, God, the chicken.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.123
All right then.

14:36.335 --> 14:39.922
-Ready?
-Can't find my keys. Got them. Yeah.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.217
-That's weird.
-What?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.385
-Got an email from Disha.
-What's she say?

14:45.469 --> 14:47.721
She says,
"Good to see you." Blah, blah, blah.

14:47.804 --> 14:48.805
"On your last visit,

14:48.889 --> 14:51.975
did you happen to see a strange
American woman bothering the children?"

14:52.059 --> 14:53.810
-What? No.
-Oh, my goodness.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.813
Yeah, look, she says, "Lovely to see you
and I'll be in touch soon."

14:56.897 --> 14:58.315
Don't do that!

14:58.398 --> 15:00.526
You see? That's what you get
for interfering, isn't it?

15:00.609 --> 15:02.319
Stop it.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.655
-Come on. Let's do it.
-Okay. All right.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.912
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, no. What?

15:11.995 --> 15:13.247
-My bike's gone!
-What?

15:13.330 --> 15:15.415
-Someone's stolen my-- My bike's gone!
-No.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.252
No! Why would they--
How'd you even get in here?

15:18.335 --> 15:19.628
-I don't know.
-Oh, my--

15:19.711 --> 15:20.629
Do you know what?

15:20.712 --> 15:22.798
Chris and Sarah, they sometimes
leave the front door unlocked.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.091
I've only had it two days.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.759
I know. I'm really sorry.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.553
We'll deal with it later
because we're gonna be late.

15:27.636 --> 15:31.473
-I'm gutted. That's not--
-I know. I know you are. It's really bad.

15:31.557 --> 15:33.141
But it's also--
It's quite common, I think.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.227
-So, yeah, come on.
-No, I'm--

15:36.061 --> 15:40.274
-Bloody hell. Can't believe that.
-I know. It's absolutely beyond me.

15:42.359 --> 15:45.070
She's been getting cold in bed,
so there's some blankets in her drawer.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.154
Uh-huh.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.574
-It's the top left of her--
-Yeah, I know.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.917
-Where are you going?
-Just... out.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.127
Yeah!

16:00.669 --> 16:02.087
With a friend.

16:05.174 --> 16:06.466
Gonna be out late or...

16:07.050 --> 16:10.554
I don't know. You never know
with these things, do you?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.435
All right, then.
See you later, darling. Bye.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.108
-It's a date, by the way.
-Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.620
I'm hungry. Can we just pick somewhere?

16:34.703 --> 16:36.830
All right, what about
that new pizza place by the tube?

16:36.914 --> 16:37.915
Is it good?

16:37.998 --> 16:40.334
I don't know. The name's all in lowercase,
so I assume so.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.963
-Oh, look, Jase, Froyo.
-So? You hate Froyo.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.381
No, loo-- vanilla, Jase.

16:46.465 --> 16:47.758
Look, they've got vanilla.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.468
-Oh, my God. That's my bike.
-What?

16:49.551 --> 16:52.179
-That is my bike!
-No, I seriously doubt that.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.932
-It is! It's still got the lock on it.
-No, Jason, wait.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.934
Excuse me. Can you stop kicking that?
That's my bike.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.185
-Whatever.
-Can I have it back, please?

16:58.268 --> 16:59.603
Some ditzy lady gave me 20 quid

16:59.686 --> 17:01.188
-to take this bike off her hands.
-What you--

17:01.271 --> 17:02.648
Oh, shit.

17:03.315 --> 17:04.483
Thank you.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.488
-How much you want for it?
-Well, more than that.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.324
-You'll have to have 40.
-Another ten and we'll call it quits.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.670
Look-- I don't like you having it,
so I gave it away. That's...

17:24.752 --> 17:26.755
That's not an apology.
You're just saying what you did.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.049
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm not apologizing.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.051
I saw the crash on your headcam, Jase.
You lied to me.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.345
I didn't want you worrying.
It looked much worse than it was.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.305
Yeah? Okay.
Well, raise your hand above your shoulder.

17:35.389 --> 17:36.598
-Don't want to.
-No, go on.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.016
I don't need to, thank you very much.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.978
When I need to raise my hand above
my shoulder, I'll put it right up there.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.105
You've had it one day, Jase.
One day, and look at you.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.524
-Look, I don't need you interfering.
-Whoa, sorry.

17:45.607 --> 17:48.652
No, I'm not interfering.
It's called love, Jase.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.571
I do stuff like this all the time for you.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.698
-What do you mean? Like what?
-Oh, I don't know.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.409
I plug your phone in
because you never remember to.

17:55.492 --> 17:58.871
I move your bookmark back a page because
you're always sleepy on the last one,

17:58.954 --> 18:00.539
-and I know you're not taking it in.
-Are you serious?

18:00.622 --> 18:01.456
Yes, I'm being serious.

18:01.540 --> 18:04.251
I rub factor 50 sun cream on you
when you ask for 15.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.377
Why?

18:05.460 --> 18:06.879
Because you are pasty,
and I've got your back.

18:06.962 --> 18:10.340
And I do not want you to have this bike!

18:10.424 --> 18:14.136
-Stop it. Get off, Nikki. Nikki!
-Don't, I'm gonna lose you, Jase!

18:16.096 --> 18:18.473
Why are you so obsessed with losing me?

18:21.852 --> 18:24.313
She's already lost two parents.

18:24.396 --> 18:27.024
And she's about to lose a brother.
That's three people, Jase.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.693
Three people by the time she's, what, ten?

18:30.986 --> 18:32.529
What happens if she loses another person?

18:32.613 --> 18:34.656
What happens to her then?
How does she recover from that?

18:34.740 --> 18:36.825
So what you wanna do?
Wrap us all in cotton wool

18:36.909 --> 18:40.287
-and never leave the house?
-Yes. If that's what it takes, Jase. Yes.

18:41.205 --> 18:43.332
I know you meant that
to sound like a bad thing,

18:43.415 --> 18:45.959
but that actually sounds amazing.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.632
How are--
How are you the one storming off?

18:53.717 --> 18:56.720
Nikki. Stop. Hey!

18:56.803 --> 18:59.848
Hey.
You shouldn't be the one storming off.

18:59.932 --> 19:01.892
I'm the one who should be storming off.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.607
-Can I come now?
-No.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.403
-What about now?
-Fine.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.127
Milady.

19:33.507 --> 19:36.552
-Are you not drinking?
-Tap water. It's free.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.178
Legally they have to provide it.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.559
God, it's so hot in here.

19:47.229 --> 19:50.691
Sorry about the vest top.
I spilled something on my shirt.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.614
Actually, I might stand if that's okay.

19:57.698 --> 20:00.909
Sitting's bad for the organs.
It's the new smoking.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.202
Right.

20:02.995 --> 20:06.331
You know, you should smile more.
Suits you.

20:09.710 --> 20:10.711
So, Jason said--

20:10.794 --> 20:12.421
No, look, I'm sorry. This is weird.
Can you just sit down?

20:12.504 --> 20:14.256
Yeah. Of course.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.843
Jason says you've got a couple of kids.

20:17.926 --> 20:21.096
-Yeah.
-Wow. That's great.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.056
You'd never have guessed. Well done.

20:23.140 --> 20:25.976
-How'd you keep the weight off?
-My husband left me.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.895
Right. I CrossFit.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.814
As a verb. Wow.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.276
I can barely do a press-up.

20:34.359 --> 20:37.029
-The secret's keeping the hips lifted.
-Is it?

20:38.197 --> 20:40.657
I mean, you've got nice hips.
They'd lift well.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.496
Could you show me?

20:47.456 --> 20:48.665
Here?

20:50.250 --> 20:52.711
-Okay. Okay.
-Wow.

20:55.047 --> 20:55.923
Okay.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.133
-Keep your arms in tight to the body.
-Yeah.

20:58.217 --> 21:02.095
And then shoulders and legs
should be one straight line.

21:02.179 --> 21:03.514
Yeah.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.433
One.

21:08.644 --> 21:09.853
Two.

21:12.731 --> 21:14.274
Three.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.956
-Got you a tea.
-Thanks very much.

21:29.039 --> 21:31.750
-It's okay.
-Lovely.

21:31.834 --> 21:32.918
Careful.

21:36.797 --> 21:37.798
That's sugary.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.259
Yeah, that's what four sugars taste like.

21:41.009 --> 21:43.303
Normally I put in two
and tell you it's four.

21:43.387 --> 21:45.013
-This is exactly how I like it.
-Oh, is it?

21:45.097 --> 21:46.139
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.

21:46.223 --> 21:47.307
-This is lovely.
-Nice.

21:47.391 --> 21:49.726
Spot on. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:05.492 --> 22:06.493
What?

22:08.745 --> 22:10.998
-You can ride your bike if you want to.
-Can I, yeah?

22:11.081 --> 22:13.333
-Yeah.
-That's very kind. Thank you.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.046
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.298
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.716
Honduras is the deadliest place
to defend the planet

22:20.799 --> 22:23.427
because people who have fought
to protect their land--

22:23.510 --> 22:25.470
-Oh, my God. Jase, look.
-Yeah.

22:25.554 --> 22:27.097
-No, turn it back.
-What? Why?

22:27.181 --> 22:30.475
-Turn it-- Oi. Turn it back.
-I don't want to watch that bor--

22:30.559 --> 22:33.478
Oh, my God. Jason!

22:33.562 --> 22:35.856
-Yeah? Yeah?
-That's Maria!

22:35.939 --> 22:37.399
But who's the-- Which-- No.

22:37.482 --> 22:40.861
-It is! Oh, my God. Jason.
-No. No. Yeah?

22:40.944 --> 22:44.740
That is Maria! Look! Look, it's her.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.325
-It's Maria.
-Oh, yeah!

22:46.408 --> 22:50.204
She's talking on the news.
Maria is talking on the news, Jason.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.288
Bloody hell.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.165
I sponsored her out of poverty.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.959
-And now she's talking on the bloody news.
-Yeah.

22:57.044 --> 22:59.838
God, I didn't even know
she was an activist.

22:59.922 --> 23:02.382
I thought she just worked
at that beach café with Eduardo.

23:02.466 --> 23:03.884
Oh, jeez.

23:05.344 --> 23:07.262
God, that is so strange, though.

23:07.930 --> 23:10.307
I don't know why she didn't mention that
in her letters.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.226
-Nikki?
-Yeah?

23:13.977 --> 23:15.187
What? What's going on?

23:15.270 --> 23:18.774
Nikki, she didn't mention it
in the letters because...

23:20.692 --> 23:22.861
-Yeah?
-Because she didn't write them. I did.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.157
-Sorry. What you talking about?
-I wrote those letters.

23:27.241 --> 23:28.242
You--

23:29.201 --> 23:30.327
Sorry, what?

23:31.286 --> 23:35.082
Right. Okay, so do you remember
a few years ago

23:35.165 --> 23:36.375
when you were feeling down, right?

23:36.458 --> 23:38.627
You decided to sponsor a child
to make you feel better.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.170
She didn't reply,
and it made you feel worse?

23:40.254 --> 23:41.505
-Yeah.
-Well,

23:41.588 --> 23:47.302
I wrote a letter pretending to be her,
and then you loved it.

23:47.386 --> 23:50.180
And then you started expecting one
every few months,

23:50.264 --> 23:54.142
-so I just sort of continued.
-Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

23:54.226 --> 23:57.104
Then you wanted a photograph,
so I went on the Internet to get one,

23:57.187 --> 23:59.773
and I've ended up getting someone
off the news by mistake, obviously.

23:59.857 --> 24:01.066
Sorry, Jason, you...

24:01.733 --> 24:05.988
You've been pretending to be a child
that I sponsor for two years?

24:06.572 --> 24:08.949
-Accidentally, yes.
-That--

24:09.950 --> 24:12.953
-That is beyond creepy.
-I thought you'd think it was sweet.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.872
Jason, I don't believe this!

24:14.955 --> 24:17.624
You're the one who just said
we need to look out for each other more.

24:17.708 --> 24:20.919
And you just told me to not interfere.

24:21.003 --> 24:22.004
Hypocrite!

24:22.671 --> 24:24.256
Where you go-- What you doing?

24:25.757 --> 24:28.844
-Oi. Come on.
-No! No.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.933
-Hypocrite!
-Nikki.

24:36.143 --> 24:38.270
Took me bloody ages.

24:39.062 --> 24:43.442
"And that is the very end
of the adventure of the wardrobe.

24:43.942 --> 24:45.777
But if the professor was right,

24:46.653 --> 24:50.908
it was only the beginning
of the adventures of Narnia.

24:53.202 --> 24:54.411
The end."

24:55.787 --> 24:56.997
-Night night, sweetheart.
-Good night.

25:03.462 --> 25:04.880
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:05.714 --> 25:08.967
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, good as gold.

25:09.051 --> 25:11.386
You're back early. Nice night?

25:11.470 --> 25:13.430
Yeah. It was good.

25:13.514 --> 25:15.182
It was really, really good, actually.

25:16.099 --> 25:17.226
Good.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.061
Right, well...

25:21.563 --> 25:22.898
-Thanks.
-Sure.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.567
Just FYI, when the brownies were cooking,

25:25.651 --> 25:27.402
Lauren said they were "still loading."

25:27.486 --> 25:30.405
So I think we should probably
reevaluate her screen time.

25:30.489 --> 25:31.490
Okay.

25:32.783 --> 25:34.284
Okay, well, I'll...

25:34.368 --> 25:35.744
-Bye.
-See ya.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.806
Hi. You busy?

25:56.765 --> 25:58.559
Great. Do you wanna come over?

26:01.854 --> 26:03.355
That was during the IVF.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.525
When you were...

26:07.609 --> 26:09.278
so sad and I didn't know what to do,

26:09.361 --> 26:12.072
and I've ended up doing something mad.

26:16.869 --> 26:19.496
I nearly killed her off
in that earthquake in 2019.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.123
You remember that? I...

26:22.791 --> 26:24.168
I didn't have the heart.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.046
You learnt Spanish for me?

26:28.714 --> 26:30.090
Well, un poco, sí.

26:31.383 --> 26:34.511
Spent an absolute fortune
on Honduran stamps and all. I mean...

26:34.595 --> 26:37.472
They are not easy to get.
Let me tell you that.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.352
-So we're both helicopters then?
-Seems like it, doesn't it?

26:42.436 --> 26:43.937
We need to work on that.

26:44.021 --> 26:46.148
I don't know about that.

26:46.231 --> 26:49.651
'Cause she's a nine-year-old girl, Nikki,
who's grown up without her mum and dad.

26:49.735 --> 26:52.738
She's facing the prospects
of living without her brother.

26:52.821 --> 26:55.240
I think she's had enough independence,
actually,

26:55.324 --> 26:59.077
and I think that she could do
with a bit of smothering love.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.664
Well, we can definitely do that.

27:02.748 --> 27:03.916
Oh, God, yeah.

27:07.336 --> 27:11.131
I just thought I was getting letters
off someone whose life I changed.

27:12.216 --> 27:15.260
Well... you were.

27:17.721 --> 27:18.847
You were.
