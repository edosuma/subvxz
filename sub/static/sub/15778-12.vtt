00:07.041 --> 00:08.975
Morning, sugar blossom.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.476
Breakfast in bed.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.241
I got an orange
and a bag of carob pretzels.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.907
That's all they had
in the mini-bar.

00:14.949 --> 00:18.316
Why don't you put that crap down
and come over here?

00:21.555 --> 00:24.991
Hello, girls.
Remember me?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.856
Dumpling? Have you had
some work done?

00:26.894 --> 00:28.953
I can barely get
my hands around them.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.964
They're exactly the same size.

00:30.998 --> 00:35.697
- Are you riding your menstrual cycle?
- No! What are you getting at?

00:35.736 --> 00:37.966
That maybe you're hiding
something from me?

00:38.005 --> 00:40.667
Like a little gift
that Phantom Limb left in your oven.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.903
All right.
I knew you couldn't handle this.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.810
It's crazy! We've been meeting
in this crappy hotel...

00:45.846 --> 00:48.644
like, three times a week
and it's going nowhere!

00:48.682 --> 00:52.118
All right, fine, I'll do Thursdays, too!
But only for, like, an hour.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.643
Which means we have
to get right to the dirty deed!

00:54.688 --> 00:56.656
I give you permission
to begin without me.

00:56.690 --> 01:00.023
Gee, thanks. Look, I keep coming
home with welts on my neck...

01:00.060 --> 01:02.654
and the
"I got jumped by Flying Squid" excuse...

01:02.696 --> 01:05.665
is starting to get Phantom Limb
a wee bit suspicious.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.963
Screw Phantom Limb!
No, wait, no, don't.

01:08.002 --> 01:10.334
Don't you get it?!
I love you!

01:10.371 --> 01:12.362
But I don't want this!

01:12.406 --> 01:14.499
All right. Fine!

01:14.541 --> 01:17.305
Oh, crap. You're crying. I... l...

01:17.344 --> 01:18.470
Marry... me?

01:18.512 --> 01:21.447
Stop it, I'm worn
down from all this!

01:21.482 --> 01:23.712
I should go.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.151
- Marry me.
- You're being serious?

01:26.186 --> 01:28.051
Deadly serious!

01:28.956 --> 01:30.514
- Yes.
- Good! Done.

01:30.557 --> 01:32.422
Now get your ass back in that bed!

01:32.459 --> 01:35.087
But we need to make
some ground rules.

01:35.129 --> 01:39.498
One. No more of this "I need my space,
you're crowding me" crap.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.763
Fine, whatever.
Where were you hiding that list?

01:41.802 --> 01:44.566
Two! I'm not your number two.
I'm your partner.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.664
OK. I'll get you
a crown or something.

01:46.707 --> 01:50.199
Anything else on that magic
and probably moist list of yours?

01:50.244 --> 01:53.873
Yes, number three.
This whole Dr. Venture thing is over.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.178
Yes! We kill him once and for all!

01:56.216 --> 01:58.446
And we shall make
slaves of his sons...

01:58.485 --> 02:00.715
and a lamp from the flesh
of Brock Samson!

02:00.754 --> 02:02.415
No! I want you to give up...

02:02.456 --> 02:05.721
this insane grudge you have
with Dr. Venture once and for all!

02:05.759 --> 02:08.785
No way!
Dr. Venture is my sworn enemy!

02:08.829 --> 02:11.024
Never mind then,
I knew you weren't serious!

02:11.065 --> 02:12.123
No, no, don't go!

02:13.901 --> 02:17.632
Fine, I'll do it.
No more arching Dr. Venture.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.229
- Ever?
- Never.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.798
- Swear.
- I pinky swear!

02:22.710 --> 02:24.905
OK? Are you happy now?

02:24.945 --> 02:28.244
The happiest woman alive.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.547
He's gonna kill us.

02:34.588 --> 02:38.115
- Maybe if we beg for mercy.
- God, let him.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.058
It would be such sweet release...

02:40.094 --> 02:43.086
from this torture
we've brought upon ourselves.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.958
F... it, you kill me.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.025
Just don't hit my head
or make too much noise doing it.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.867
I have an idea, Chunk.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.567
You open this door, and I'll kill ya.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.009
What did we do?

02:58.045 --> 03:00.741
Sh...! I thought I dreamt that part.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.991 --> 03:13.960
Apparently, you lost your hearing
as well as your arms.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.519
I said I'm getting married
to your girlfriend!

03:16.563 --> 03:18.827
Yes, yes. I heard you.

03:18.866 --> 03:19.992
You surprise me, Limb.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.093
You're taking this pretty well.
I thought you'd try to kill me.

03:23.137 --> 03:25.401
I'm no fool, Monarch.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.602
You don't live with a woman
and not know when this is coming.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.500
You don't dine on the bounty
of a woman's flesh...

03:31.545 --> 03:34.013
...and not know what she's thinking.
- OK, OK.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.175
You don't drive your manhood
over and over into a woman and...

03:37.217 --> 03:38.514
Yes, stop. I get it!

03:38.552 --> 03:41.817
Just give me her sh... and let me go.
She needs something old.

03:41.855 --> 03:45.689
In due time.
I thought we'd have a nice chat first.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.222
There's one.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.027
- Was that Mr. Monday?
- Yes.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.128
You two were in prison together,
were you not?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.673
I saw him... around. I think.

04:01.708 --> 04:05.144
You'd be surprised at the array
of wildlife here on the grounds.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.977
Wonder what other game
we could scare up.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.314
Dr... Septapus?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.316
Oh, don't tell me.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.017
Not another one
of your former prison mates?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.720
What are the odds?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.854
All right, Limb.
What's going on here?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.557
Just disposing of some vermin.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.566
Terrible, the havoc they can wreak...

04:26.600 --> 04:28.898
on a meticulously
manicured lawn, you know.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.029
OK, OK, fine.
So what did you do?

04:33.073 --> 04:36.736
Bust all these guys out of jail
just to show me how ruthless you are?

04:36.777 --> 04:40.008
What do you take me for, a common thug?

04:40.047 --> 04:43.710
Of course not. I hired them
an excellent appeals attorney.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.581
And there he is.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.281
Please! Phantom Limb!

04:49.289 --> 04:51.587
I did everything you asked!

04:52.659 --> 04:54.752
I'm a reasonable man, Monarch.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.696
But don't think for a moment
that I will forget this.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.995
Revenge, like gazpacho soup...

05:00.033 --> 05:03.764
is best served cold,
precise and merciless.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.238
Oh, yeah. You can never
have enough precision in your soup.

05:06.273 --> 05:09.333
Look, nutjob, I hate
these traitorous dinks more than you do!

05:09.376 --> 05:11.401
So shoot whoever you want.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.209
Go.

05:16.250 --> 05:19.276
Her sh... is by the door
in a box marked "Hers."

05:21.188 --> 05:24.316
It's like playing keep-away
with the neighborhood spastic.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.121
Can't get a bead on him.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.389
You should give us
the all-seeing orb.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.794
"You should?" nice, Al.
Very polite.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.856
What? You catch more flies with honey.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.097
- Give us the eye, or face oblivion!
- Please!

05:36.136 --> 05:38.104
Fat chance, ladies.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.005
Weep the tears
of damnation!

05:41.041 --> 05:43.839
Form the Thaumaturgic Man-Mound!

05:52.286 --> 05:55.449
Man, Orpheus, what are you wearing?
Golf shoes?

05:55.489 --> 05:59.357
I think my hand is bleeding.
And the squirming...

05:59.393 --> 06:00.985
I think it's the flip part.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.155
That's the zing.
We need the zing.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.925
Well, the zing hurts my hand.

06:04.965 --> 06:08.059
Well, if we practiced more often
than once a month...

06:08.101 --> 06:10.296
Hey, look!
I'm in <i>The Residents!</i>

06:10.337 --> 06:13.135
Does anybody else feel
even slightly embarrassed here?

06:13.173 --> 06:14.435
Only most of the time.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.465
Practice makes perfect!

06:16.510 --> 06:18.774
We shall meet at my home
for some real training.

06:18.812 --> 06:22.270
Yeah!
Slumber party!

06:22.316 --> 06:24.614
Are you out of your f... minds?!

06:24.651 --> 06:27.711
They were going to be our gift to you guys.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.120
"On this your wedding day."

06:30.157 --> 06:32.682
You dicks!
I promised her!

06:32.726 --> 06:36.958
I made a pinky swear!
A sacred pinky swear!

06:36.997 --> 06:41.764
Dr. Fiancée is going to flip! And then
she will never have sex with me again!

06:41.802 --> 06:44.236
- How does he do that?
- I can hear that in my eyes!

06:44.271 --> 06:46.899
Will you shut up
and listen to your leader?!

06:46.940 --> 06:48.237
Do not do that.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.140
OK. We get it. We screwed up.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.476
Just use the quiet voice, please.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.914
Look, don't think I'm not impressed.
I am. That isn't what this is about.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.544
I'd love to know
why you couldn't pull this off...

06:59.586 --> 07:02.054
at, like, any point
in the last ten years, but...

07:02.089 --> 07:04.523
Wait a minute.
How the hell did you pull this off?

07:04.558 --> 07:07.254
Well, after the party died down
and you went to bed...

07:07.294 --> 07:09.956
you know, some of us
were still pretty wired...

07:09.997 --> 07:13.398
and so we decided to pick up
a case and hit the tenderloin.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.491
Loin.

07:14.534 --> 07:17.526
Mind you, we were
wicked toasted by this point...

07:17.571 --> 07:20.005
which is when I spotted
this tattoo parlor...

07:20.040 --> 07:22.508
and I just had
to get me some ink.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.670
See? I've had this design
in my wallet for, like, a year...

07:25.712 --> 07:27.737
but, you know, that sh... is permanent.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.874
- You never had the balls.
- Guilty.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.817
But once this Cowardly Lion
got himself some courage...

07:32.853 --> 07:36.345
from that Wizard of Booze,
we went in there. Stand by.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.350
OK, so we get in there.

07:39.393 --> 07:41.953
And who should we see,
not, like, ten feet away...

07:41.995 --> 07:44.429
getting himself
a sweet friggin' tat?

07:44.464 --> 07:48.059
None other than Brock Samson,
murderist extraordinaire.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.161
Slayer of men,
slayer of henchmen.

07:51.204 --> 07:55.231
He, who would, and has, totally ripped
our heads off if he saw us coming.

07:55.275 --> 07:58.403
Which, of course, he didn't,
so we got the jump on him.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.382
Now there were, of course,
the predictable casualties.

08:04.418 --> 08:05.407
Of course.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.114
But once he was, like,
totally out of the picture...

08:08.155 --> 08:10.385
we naturally got to thinking...

08:10.424 --> 08:12.654
Dr. Venture's,
like, easy pickings now.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.161
And what better gift to get The Monarch,
than his arch-nemesis?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.755
Honey!

08:18.799 --> 08:22.667
I'm going to start getting dressed.
I just want... What the f...?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.728
Funny face! You're...

08:25.772 --> 08:27.262
- Hi.
- I can't believe you.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.708
You couldn't keep a promise
for one lousy month?!

08:30.744 --> 08:32.405
That's it. I'm calling this off.

08:32.446 --> 08:35.073
No, no, no, no.
This isn't how it looks.

08:35.115 --> 08:39.847
You've got Dr. Venture and
his whole f... family in that f... cell...

08:39.885 --> 08:41.751
and this isn't how it looks?

08:41.788 --> 08:44.484
No. Of course not, pookums.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.288
He's... He's my best man.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.124
You know, I wanted to prove to you...

08:49.162 --> 08:52.188
I was going to let bygones be bygones.
Turn over a new leaf.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.360
Then why are they in our holding cell?

08:55.402 --> 08:59.133
Because, well... we were rehearsing
the whole ring thing, you know...

08:59.172 --> 09:02.573
and the blonde kid, he was all, like,
"Is that a real prison cell?"

09:02.609 --> 09:04.941
And I'm like,
"Yeah, you want to see inside?"

09:04.978 --> 09:07.640
And between you and me,
the kid's not the sharpest tack.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.945
Pretty sure he thinks
we're in a submarine.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.041
Where are we?

09:11.084 --> 09:14.247
- See?
- All right, fine.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.584
Well, I got to get ready.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.056
The next time I see you,
we'll be man and wife.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.615
Can't wait.

09:28.568 --> 09:32.527
See you later...
Mr. Girlfriend.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.507
<i>A bientôt,</i>
Dr. Mrs. Monarch.

09:37.677 --> 09:42.705
The Council of 13 has reviewed
your request and it is denied.

09:42.749 --> 09:46.185
You are to commit no acts of vengeance
against The Monarch.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.585
It matters not that
you were dumped.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.318
And that's kinda... you know.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.816
- I understand, Sovereign.
- May I suggest you start a journal?

09:54.861 --> 09:59.889
There you could pour out your woes
upon the tear-stained pages of dear diary.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.834
That is an excellent suggestion,
my liege.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.235
Or maybe go jogging with friends.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.605
I shall do just that!
You honor me, my master.

10:08.642 --> 10:12.578
So I have your word then?
No movement on The Monarch.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.877
- You have my word.
- Excellent!

10:15.916 --> 10:19.909
Well, I'm glad we got this wrapped up.
I've got a wedding to get to.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.653
I'm gonna go.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.763
I can't thank you jerks enough.

10:37.804 --> 10:41.934
So, you and Manwich
are finally tying the knot, huh?

10:41.975 --> 10:44.603
I always figured you for a closet case.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.839
In your dreams, macho man.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.646
I'm about to marry the hottest piece
of ass in Supervillainy.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.653
- Why would you do this?
- What, be a henchman?

10:56.690 --> 11:00.592
Yeah! Retardo costume, some skinny guy
yelling at you all the time...

11:00.627 --> 11:02.595
Dude, are you describing me or you?

11:02.629 --> 11:05.223
- I don't wear a costume.
- What!? Are you drunk?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.825
Where do you even buy
a baby blue kerchief?

11:07.868 --> 11:09.335
I just said kerchief.

11:09.369 --> 11:13.430
Dude, what, does your dad
use his time machine to go shopping?

11:13.473 --> 11:17.102
Are the walls titanium,
or made of secret rocket-ship metal?

11:17.143 --> 11:20.010
What? Who cares?
I know they're wicked easy to stain.

11:20.046 --> 11:23.072
Then we can rule out
any chromium-based metals.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.175
Those clean nicely with a damp cloth.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.982
All right. I'll "rule that out."

11:28.021 --> 11:31.650
So... you... like being a...

11:31.691 --> 11:34.558
- Dean?
- Yeah, a Dean.

11:34.594 --> 11:37.085
That must kind of... suck.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.497
Come on, that voice!?
Sounds like a dude!

11:40.533 --> 11:44.094
- Probably still half a dude.
- Hell-o, jealous much?

11:44.137 --> 11:46.401
Excuse me,
but I am not the rough trade...

11:46.439 --> 11:50.273
in a tight camisole
with a naked guy tattooed on my arm!

11:50.310 --> 11:53.746
It's not finished. Supposed to be Icarus.
You know, from the <i>Led...</i>

11:53.780 --> 11:58.308
<i>Zeppelin</i> albums, yeah, yeah.
Super f... cool! When I was, like, 14.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.549
Sweetie, it's bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.388
It's Doct... Rusty Venture.

12:06.893 --> 12:10.329
- I have something for you.
- Sorry.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.962
I brought you something blue.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.796
Me.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.865
So...

12:17.904 --> 12:20.702
you agreed to be the best man.
That's rather big of you.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.709
That's not the only thing
that's big of me.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.973
Are you trying
to say something sexual?

12:26.012 --> 12:28.378
Don't play games here... Charlene.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.973
Who is Charlene?

12:30.016 --> 12:32.644
Why don't you two go help
Willy Wonka or something?

12:32.686 --> 12:34.381
This is grown-up business.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.851
Who is Charlene?!

12:37.891 --> 12:41.725
Only the finest woman
in 18 years to steal my heart...

12:41.761 --> 12:45.322
only the sexiest pile of girl parts
to climb Mount Rusty.

12:45.365 --> 12:49.062
What? I have no idea what you're...
Oh, my God!

12:50.403 --> 12:53.839
I'm here!
And I've got some fancy beer...

12:53.873 --> 12:57.331
and some chips
that are guaranteed to be extreme!

12:57.377 --> 12:59.311
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

12:59.346 --> 13:03.009
By putting a lightning bolt on the bag.
Where's JT? I got him a surprise.

13:03.049 --> 13:07.247
- He's setting up the apparatus.
- Apparatus? Sounds sexy.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.524
Al, what is that?
I need earplugs to look at your shirt.

13:11.558 --> 13:15.187
I'm in disguise as a paunchy gay guy
who loved Jimmy Buffett.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.389
I thought
you were setting up an apparatus!

13:17.430 --> 13:20.263
That's a pilates mat
and a baby's first birthday candle.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.700
Orpheus is trying to hone
our conjuring skills.

13:22.736 --> 13:25.261
Great. I'll try
to work up some interest.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.865
But in the meanwhile,
what say you gents to...

13:27.907 --> 13:29.636
taking the edge off?

13:29.676 --> 13:32.304
For one, it's only noon,
and two, I don't drink.

13:32.345 --> 13:36.304
Drink. I know.
I have here, in this very bag...

13:36.349 --> 13:37.782
five packs of nickel nips.

13:37.817 --> 13:42.481
Maybe after we have filled our bellies
with the super-natural.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.887
There is much to do!

13:43.923 --> 13:47.359
Yeah, like watch JT go blind
on red-flavored sugar water.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.555
Orpheus, get the insulin!

13:49.596 --> 13:51.063
It's been a while.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.121
What's that?!

13:53.299 --> 13:57.235
You say you're waxy good.
You tease.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.597
I think I've still got
an old costume you can wear.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.007
And before you say it,
I was much slimmer then.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.740
I was gonna say
you have more toys than a little girl.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.806
- What? Dude, there are no toys in here.
- What do you call that?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.908
- That's a maquette.
- Doll. And that?

14:11.951 --> 14:14.317
- That is a collectable bust.
- That is a toy.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.322
How can you play
with a disembodied head?

14:16.356 --> 14:20.793
Well, he could be like a...
like an all-knowing head that tells...

14:20.827 --> 14:24.524
- Quisp?
- That tells Quisp that he has to kill...

14:24.564 --> 14:26.862
- The micronaut.
- Kill the micronaut.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.867
- So do you wanna...
- Only if I get to be that He-Man head.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.635
I bet I know what I'd like to do.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.871
Is it sit quietly
till the wedding begins?

14:37.911 --> 14:41.142
No, silly! I would sure love
a tour of the engine room.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.207
I've only read about engines
that run on anti-matter.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.083
OK, there, junior science cadet.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.418
Why don't you go exploring or something?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.219
Just don't touch anything.

14:51.257 --> 14:54.658
Aye-aye, sir. I'll touch with my eyes,
not with my hands.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.423
Care to escort this cadet?

14:56.463 --> 14:59.762
That's a negative, Cadet Dean...

14:59.799 --> 15:01.960
who really should
be going now.

15:02.001 --> 15:04.561
Under orders?
That's preposterous!

15:04.604 --> 15:07.164
- You were all over me.
- That was my mission.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.573
I seduce you,
turn you into a butterfly...

15:09.609 --> 15:13.101
and then The Monarch was going to tie you
to this huge bug zapper thing.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.774
But you didn't!
You gave me the antidote. And why?

15:15.815 --> 15:18.978
Because I turned the tables
and made you fall for me.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.885
- You didn't even know it was me!
- Well, I do now.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.857
And I put two and two together,
and that equals forever.

15:25.892 --> 15:30.022
All right. Basics. You understand
that you're my boyfriend's archenemy?

15:30.063 --> 15:31.758
You know how this works, right?

15:31.798 --> 15:34.767
I know what works.
I know that <i>we</i> works.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.861
And I know as sure as sugar
that you planned this whole thing.

15:37.904 --> 15:41.067
Yes. Exactly.
That was my big dream.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.974
I wanted to get The Monarch
and Dr. Venture together...

15:44.010 --> 15:46.638
and then do them both.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.671
I'm not willing to share you.
You have to make a choice.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.946
What's a girl to do?

15:51.985 --> 15:54.510
Will you zip me up?
You kicked my moppets out.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.784
Die! Die!

15:56.823 --> 15:59.257
- I killed Hugo!
- You totally missed!

15:59.292 --> 16:00.850
Oh, my God! So wrong!

16:00.894 --> 16:03.692
Solarian has, like,
20/two billion vision.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.893
Cool beans!
The beard comes off.

16:06.933 --> 16:10.425
Hello-ski! I am, how you say,
Russian Guyovitch!

16:10.470 --> 16:13.962
Hank, you should totally grow
one of those! You look like Green Arrow.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.271
Or, like, the mirror mirror version of Hank!

16:16.309 --> 16:19.335
- Yeah, Evil Hank!
- Yeah, Evil Hank, completely.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.176
Crap, is that the time?

16:21.214 --> 16:24.308
Dude, the guests will be here any minute
and I'm not even dressed!

16:24.350 --> 16:26.978
Hello, Rusty,
it's time to get up!

16:27.020 --> 16:29.250
OK, come on,
we've got work to do.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.883
And then, like,
that wasn't enough...

16:31.925 --> 16:35.656
I ended up with a raging case
of crotch crickets.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.095
And did I get an apology? Hell, no.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.395
I got a, "I'll call you."

16:41.534 --> 16:44.002
Still waiting for that chestnut.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.562
OK, Byron, your turn.
Truth or dare.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.439
You're actually talking to me?
Truth.

16:49.475 --> 16:53.241
Did you really think you could get
a bunch of middle-aged men together...

16:53.279 --> 16:55.679
to chase bad guys around
and take it seriously?

16:55.715 --> 16:57.910
Well, yes, I did,
as a matter of fact.

16:57.951 --> 17:00.943
The Order of the Triad
has potential.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.080
Potential?
When JT was conscious...

17:03.122 --> 17:06.250
he was throwing up
artificial cherry-flavored vomit.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.326
And I'm a little
Busby Berkeley myself.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.424
Just don't touch anything.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.101
What could go wrong?

17:16.135 --> 17:18.865
You know I'm on the PA
and not in your mind, right?

17:18.905 --> 17:21.464
What? Yeah.
I wasn't going to push it.

17:21.507 --> 17:25.409
- Good. Now get to the wedding.
- Okie-dokie.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.881
- Good. You going to the ceremony?
- Yes... sir.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.974
The radar's been lit up
like a Christmas tree.

17:31.017 --> 17:34.714
You got to get these radars to
The Monarch, pronto. Keep it hush, OK?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.316
What is that?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.265
- You seen my brother?
- Nah, he's probably sitting down...

17:50.303 --> 17:52.897
torturing Monstroso
with Snapple Facts.

17:52.939 --> 17:56.636
Nah, I don't think... Holy moly!
That guy is almost a truck!

17:57.677 --> 17:58.939
Truckulese?

17:58.978 --> 18:00.309
- Yeah.
- With a "T."

18:00.346 --> 18:02.439
Here you are... and your guest.

18:02.482 --> 18:06.543
Came stag, friend.
This big ol' rig takes up two seats.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.680
OK, but you only get
one bag of Jordan Almonds.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.919
Bride's side,
fourth row, seats 6-7.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.655
- Where am I sitting?
- You are...

18:15.695 --> 18:18.687
next to... Sergeant Hatred and guest.

18:19.832 --> 18:20.821
No.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.335
Look at that, honey!
Look at that!

18:23.369 --> 18:26.236
Tell me those aren't the monitors
from my old hover tank?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.206
What the hell kind of a deal is this...

18:28.241 --> 18:31.802
what kind of a shabby
operation they running here?

18:33.179 --> 18:35.613
You're not gonna
bad touch me, are you?

18:35.648 --> 18:38.014
Do I know?
Honey, do we know him?

18:38.051 --> 18:40.611
No! Hello-ski! I am...

18:40.653 --> 18:43.121
How you say?
Russian Guyovitch!

18:43.156 --> 18:47.115
Sergeant Hatred, pleased to meet you!
This here's Princess Tiny Feet.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.720
Show him, honey.
Show him the little gentlemen.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.286
So she is.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.528
Look at those
perfect little toes, so plump!

18:54.567 --> 18:58.731
Like little nibblets!
Like little corn nibblets!

18:58.771 --> 19:01.672
- Maize.
- That's right, honey!

19:01.708 --> 19:04.142
Hot damn it!
Those things are beautiful!

19:04.177 --> 19:06.907
Gimmie, gimmie!
Gimmie just a little! Gimmie just...

19:12.518 --> 19:15.453
- No way!
- Is that?

19:15.488 --> 19:17.285
David Bowie.

19:17.323 --> 19:21.054
- Brock Samson, it's been a while.
- Not long enough.

19:21.094 --> 19:25.656
You're lucky I don't kill you right here
after what you pulled in Berlin.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.325
You're welcome to try.

19:28.434 --> 19:32.165
- What the hell are you doing here?
- He's giving me away.

19:32.205 --> 19:36.301
You look fabulous!
Thank you so much for doing this, David.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.340
And one, two...

19:43.449 --> 19:47.317
All right. Left foot on the one
but don't enter until the second verse!

19:47.353 --> 19:48.581
I'll know when to go out.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.816
- She's too good for you.
- Are you still mad at me?

19:50.857 --> 19:53.348
What!? I'm suddenly supposed
to be your best friend?

19:53.393 --> 19:56.157
I can't remember a day of my life
that you didn't f... up.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.323
Calm down. Look at all that history!
We have so much in common.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.765
You don't know the half of it, buddy-boy.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.292
What is that supposed to mean?
There she is!

20:04.337 --> 20:05.804
Hi, pookums!

20:05.838 --> 20:08.807
- I feel so dirty when they start talking cute.
- Get used to it.

20:08.841 --> 20:12.777
I wanna tell her that I love her
but the point is probably moot.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.712
Are you reciting <i>Jessie's Girl?</i>

20:19.819 --> 20:20.808
Sorry!

20:20.853 --> 20:23.048
Dearly beloved...

20:23.089 --> 20:26.456
We just need to take it
more seriously.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.255
The séance
was going great.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.353
Don't you remember
how light as a feather...

20:30.396 --> 20:34.025
...and stiff as a board Jefferson was?
- He's still pretty stiff.

20:34.066 --> 20:38.366
And we were able to materialize
a spirit from the beyond...

20:38.404 --> 20:40.804
or at least from a trading card.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.205
Yeah. Poor guy.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.544
Can we take him in the back
and kill him with a shovel or something?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.979
Why am I bothering?
You don't care about this.

20:49.015 --> 20:52.416
No. I care about
the true spirit of the divine!

20:52.452 --> 20:54.682
I care about
the universal truth...

20:54.720 --> 20:58.781
but being a magic super hero
that keeps chasing the same guy?

20:58.825 --> 21:00.383
It's completely gay!

21:00.426 --> 21:02.758
And that is coming from a guy...

21:02.795 --> 21:05.491
that voluntarily has sex with men!

21:05.531 --> 21:07.556
Well.
So does this mean it's over?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.295
- Are we breaking up?
- I guess so.

21:09.335 --> 21:12.827
Do you want me to pack up
my blackula hunter and leave quietly?

21:12.872 --> 21:16.171
Come on, Byron, don't be
so ding-dong serious all the time!

21:17.944 --> 21:20.538
Your Montel Williams
neck pin is blinking.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.544
There is cosmic peril somewhere.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.609
No, no, answer it!
I guess I'll just wait.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.780
It says that Dr. Venture
and his entire family are in danger.

21:30.823 --> 21:34.224
Then there was something about
hundreds of deaths. Like you care.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.751
No! You old bag of sad!

21:36.796 --> 21:38.525
<i>That</i> I care about!

21:38.564 --> 21:42.364
That's the kind of cosmic ju-ju
<i>I am</i> interested in!

21:42.401 --> 21:45.893
For I am, the Alchemist,
seeker of truth!

21:45.938 --> 21:50.136
And I am Dr. Orpheus,
master necromancer!

21:52.612 --> 21:56.776
And he is...
Jefferson Twilight, blackula hunter!

21:59.385 --> 22:01.945
Do you, Ms. Dr. The Girlfriend...

22:01.988 --> 22:05.719
take Mr. The Monarch to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

22:05.758 --> 22:07.453
To have and to hold...

22:07.493 --> 22:09.961
in sickness, and in health...

22:09.996 --> 22:11.520
till death do you part?

22:12.398 --> 22:13.558
I...
