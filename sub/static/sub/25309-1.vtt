01:21.280 --> 01:23.040
Chopped them off with a knife

01:23.120 --> 01:25.560

That was the music, you see.

I was just checking through it.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.960
-Yeah.
-Did you call home? How is everyone?

11:54.040 --> 11:55.760
Good. Er, you know.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.200
-Ferreting away. [chuckles]
-Oh.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.760
-Clever things.
-Yeah.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.000
And, Amy, has she... Has she read it yet?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.240
Er... Not sure. She didn't mention it.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.920
You know who her girlfriend is, don't you?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.040
No.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.800
Yes, you do.
She tells you bloody everything.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.200
I mean, I assumed it was just
one of the girls in the band?

12:13.280 --> 12:14.520
-No.
-It's because they

12:15.200 --> 12:18.120
were sort of hugging and crying and stuff
after the show.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.920
Maurice, that's just what people do
when they're friends.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.360
Right. Yeah, obviously.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.520
Are you gonna read it?

12:25.520 --> 12:28.520
Erm, I might wait
until it comes out, actually.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.160
I was thinking maybe savour it, you know.
If it is still...

12:31.240 --> 12:33.240
Maurice, we talked about this.
You said it was fine.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.280
Yeah. No. Just, erm...

12:35.360 --> 12:36.360
You said, "Crack on."

12:36.440 --> 12:39.320
Mmm, yeah, but I mean, I guess

12:39.400 --> 12:45.000
I thought that maybe you were gonna
just use it to process everything,

12:45.080 --> 12:46.120
and then at the end...

12:46.200 --> 12:48.680
But no, it's great.
I mean, I'm very proud of you.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.440
Erm, is it... I mean, is it...

12:51.080 --> 12:53.640
Is it very, very personal, or...

12:53.720 --> 12:55.880
Well, obviously it's quite personal, yes.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.520
Yeah. No, obviously, erm...

12:57.840 --> 12:58.760
Okay, erm...

12:58.840 --> 13:01.680
Well, I'm gonna go
for a little butterfly expedition.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.040
-Yes, you go for it.
-[chuckles]

13:03.640 --> 13:05.400
-Yeah. [clears throat]
-Are you feeling all right?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.320
Yeah. Just getting the air.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.800
-Ah! Ooh, yeah.
-[both chuckle]

13:11.040 --> 13:13.320
Naked is weird, isn't it?
Naked? That's weird, yeah. [chuckles]

13:13.880 --> 13:14.720
Okay.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.240
I'm gonna go.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.280
-Have fun.
-Yeah, I'm gonna run.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.160
-Okay.
-Oh!

13:20.680 --> 13:22.760
There's some over here, actually. Deborah.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.240
Yes?

13:24.320 --> 13:26.920
It's like they're dancing,
they're so agile.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.720
I've got one!

13:29.800 --> 13:30.840
Deborah.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.000
It's massive. [chuckles]

13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
I've got a red one!

13:34.280 --> 13:35.240
Deborah.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.400
Well done!

13:44.200 --> 13:45.200
[doorbell buzzing]

13:45.440 --> 13:46.760
[dog barking]

13:50.320 --> 13:51.160
[door opens]

13:52.960 --> 13:53.920
Oh!

13:54.480 --> 13:55.840
-Hello.
-How are you, Matilda?

13:56.160 --> 13:57.120
Er...

13:58.120 --> 13:59.080
Yeah. Okay.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.600
-What... What are you--
-I just wanted to let you know

14:01.680 --> 14:03.560
that I'm running my own business now.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.680
-Okay.
-So that's good, isn't it?

14:05.760 --> 14:06.640
[scoffs] Yeah.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.080
Well done.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.240
The Great Pipe Man.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.120
Bespoke plumbing service
for the discerning customer.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.480
Cool.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.440
So if you ever need a bit of
high-end water work-based craftsmanship

14:17.520 --> 14:19.160
at a bargain price... [chuckles]

14:22.880 --> 14:24.040
Obviously, we do mate's rates.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.440
Hmm, that would help, actually.
I'm a bit broke at the moment.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.240
No... As in...

14:28.840 --> 14:29.920
Because we're mates,

14:30.880 --> 14:31.880
you pay me more.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.960
I knew you were fucking the priest.

14:36.040 --> 14:39.520
Yeah, well, she's weird around people,
so just act like it's normal.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.480
It is normal.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.720
You know what I mean.
Just don't be like, [high-pitched] "Hi!"

14:42.800 --> 14:44.960
So, you want us to ignore your girlfriend?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.000
No. [sighs]

14:46.280 --> 14:48.680
[Pan] How can she be weird around people
when she's a priest?

14:48.760 --> 14:51.520
Well, it's only in real life.
She's fine when it's, like, priest time.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.560
Oi! Lightning!

14:54.520 --> 14:56.080
What's all these balloons about?

14:56.360 --> 14:57.480
Oh, you know, just...

14:57.760 --> 14:59.080
Welcome, friends!

14:59.160 --> 15:00.240
[Vera] Omsk, baby!

15:00.480 --> 15:01.480
[all whooping]

15:02.280 --> 15:03.440
Shut the front door.

15:03.680 --> 15:07.080
So you can say, "Bob's your uncle,"
even if you uncle is not called Bob?

15:07.160 --> 15:09.640
Yeah, it's just a phrase.
Like, "Hey, presto."

15:10.080 --> 15:11.400
And you know, in army,

15:11.480 --> 15:14.840
everybody call each other Roger
even though not called Roger.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.680
Who's this fucking Roger? [chuckles]

15:17.560 --> 15:18.440
Oh, my gosh.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.480
Excuse me. Booby time.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.720
-[chuckles nervously]
-Don't worry yourself, it's only a tit.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.720
Milk... [giggles softly]

15:26.080 --> 15:27.000
Delicious.

15:27.480 --> 15:28.440
Hey, everyone.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.680
This is Hylda.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.080
[Pan] You all right?
[Vera] What about ya?

15:32.160 --> 15:33.320
-Evening.
-Hello, Rev.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.280
Just normal.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.240
-Yes.
-Hello.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.280
-Good to see you.
-Say no more.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.360
One time, I see woman in park
having a booby time.

15:39.440 --> 15:42.080
Such huge breast, I am so terrify.

15:42.600 --> 15:46.240
Be careful. You baby will explode of milk.
Too full. [chuckles]

15:46.320 --> 15:47.480
[slurping]

15:47.560 --> 15:48.800
-Don't do all that.
-Oh.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.720
-Oh.
-There you go.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.560
-Nah. Come on.
-Oh, bring it in.

15:54.000 --> 15:54.920
Nice to meet you.

15:55.720 --> 15:59.240
So, you can do Irish goodbye,
but you are Welsh person.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.880
Why is not Welsh goodbye?

16:01.200 --> 16:03.040
It's just saying goodbye
without saying goodbye.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.520
So, parties happen.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.280
You relax.

16:06.920 --> 16:07.960
Time to go.

16:08.840 --> 16:09.720
Goodbye!

16:13.680 --> 16:15.120
No, you don't say it quietly.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.720
You just don't say it.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.200
Not at all?

16:18.800 --> 16:19.760
Just leave?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.560
So party, party.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.200
Relax.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.840
Time to go.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.440
Now, don't get angry with me,

16:32.520 --> 16:35.000
but I've asked the girls,
and none of them fancy you.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.120
Bollocks!

16:36.600 --> 16:39.480
That Vera's definitely angling
for a hot piece of the Pipe Man.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.920
[sighs] I really think you need to get
some friends. I think it'd help.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.760
Successful people don't have friends.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.840
You still haven't moved out
of your parents' house.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.720
This cabin was for Shun. You stole it.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.440
Yeah, because I'm the son!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.640
I don't wanna have to beat you off
out of pity when you're 85.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.600
How about Matilda?
Why don't you just invite Matilda?

16:59.680 --> 17:01.000
I don't like Fat Matilda.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.520
How many out of ten
do you not like Fat Matilda?

17:03.800 --> 17:04.840
Minus ten.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.080
You really don't like her, do you?

17:08.560 --> 17:09.440
Why have you got this, then?

17:10.440 --> 17:12.000
Hey, get off my property!

17:13.160 --> 17:14.440
I didn't even know that was in there.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.680
[Vera] Does your brother
have learning difficulties?

17:20.800 --> 17:22.920
Erm, I don't think so, no.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.880
-Yeah. You like butter.
-[Henri] It's a buttercup, mate.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.680
What? Liar.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.120
[Shun chuckles]

17:28.200 --> 17:30.600
So, I moved out
from my parents' last spring.

17:31.480 --> 17:35.560
Was gonna turn it into a headquarters
for my inventions business but then, erm--

17:35.640 --> 17:37.520
Oh, cool. What kind of inventions?

17:37.600 --> 17:38.640
Ah, there you are.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.480
Might have to dig my daily grave
in a minute.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.680
Okay, well,
we're gonna carry on for a bit.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.280
We need to work out
what we're doing with Omsk.

17:46.360 --> 17:50.800
Hair, rice, animal fat, semen,
you name it. Pow!

17:52.240 --> 17:54.600
I-- I think I might go back over.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.960
Okay, cool bean. Beans, sorry.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.800
Er, do you... Do you wanna wear my hat?

17:58.880 --> 17:59.800
No, it's cool.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.600
[Deborah] You're doing well
with the cigarettes.

18:13.040 --> 18:13.880
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.840
Er, just getting fat instead.

18:18.920 --> 18:19.800
Hmm...

18:28.360 --> 18:29.360
You know,

18:30.040 --> 18:31.040
when you

18:31.960 --> 18:35.600
ask me to pretend that
I'm someone that I'm not, when we're...

18:37.240 --> 18:40.800
Is that because
you aren't attracted to me anymore or...

18:42.400 --> 18:43.320
Erm...

18:44.120 --> 18:45.200
No.

18:45.880 --> 18:46.920
It's just...

18:48.480 --> 18:50.680
I don't know, exciting or something.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.840
Hmm, yeah.

18:52.880 --> 18:53.960
Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.240
But, I mean, I...

18:55.320 --> 18:58.480
I never have to imagine you
as anything other than you.

18:59.720 --> 19:00.920
Well, maybe you should try it.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.240
You must think about
sleeping with other people occasionally?

19:04.880 --> 19:05.840
Erm...

19:06.480 --> 19:07.760
I don't... I don't think so.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.160
You must do.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.200
No.

19:11.640 --> 19:12.760
No. [scoffs]

19:12.840 --> 19:14.240
It's not a test. You can be honest.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.320
[chuckles]

19:15.680 --> 19:16.600
Erm...

19:17.840 --> 19:19.600
I was thinking this morning about how

19:20.640 --> 19:22.200
I haven't managed to do
any work for a while.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.240
I was thinking about
going back to the doctors.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.480
I guess I was worried that

19:26.600 --> 19:29.240
without feeling like,
you know... [chuckles]

19:29.320 --> 19:33.000
Anyway, I had this weird thought
when I was running about,

19:34.640 --> 19:36.760
that the sun sets
and the sun rises every day,

19:36.840 --> 19:38.120
and we get that for free.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.040
We don't have to do anything,
and that will just happen.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.600
And obviously that's something
that doesn't really mean anything, but...

19:45.760 --> 19:46.800
Do you know what I'm...

19:46.880 --> 19:48.560
Er, no, not really.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.360
Right. Yeah.

19:50.960 --> 19:51.840
No, I mean...

19:52.480 --> 19:53.880
Well, I was trying to figure out

19:53.960 --> 19:55.840
what my brain was trying to tell me,
and I think...

19:57.600 --> 19:59.480
I think it's that I love you

19:59.560 --> 20:00.880
more than I ever have, and...

20:02.240 --> 20:04.680
I feel okay at the moment
and that feels strange,

20:04.760 --> 20:06.360
but it feels good, I think.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.560
And I don't care

20:09.560 --> 20:13.800
if I never write anything again,
or any of that stuff, because I love you.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.040
[sighs softly]

20:18.640 --> 20:22.360
Er, maybe I crave the feel
of another woman occasionally.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.160
Maybe, if I'm completely honest,
I crave the feel of a younger woman,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.080
but only in the sense that I...

20:30.880 --> 20:33.240
Lasagne's my favourite food
and I think it's delicious

20:33.320 --> 20:35.920
and I wanna eat it
for the rest of my life, but--

20:36.000 --> 20:37.440
Are you comparing me to a lasagne?

20:37.760 --> 20:39.000
No. [laughs]

20:39.800 --> 20:40.840
As in...

20:42.600 --> 20:46.600
Er, younger foods are good, erm...

20:47.440 --> 20:49.480
[stutters] But older foods, too. Erm...

20:50.840 --> 20:56.080
Or-- Or a salad. A salad is newer,
fresher food, but it's not

20:56.800 --> 21:00.760
got any nourishment, you know,
but a classic dish, or a chicken...

21:02.040 --> 21:06.960
Er, or other foods, foreign foods,
or peanuts, coleslaw, erm...

21:08.320 --> 21:11.680
Or... Or just lasagne, you know?
I do think that sometimes...

21:13.080 --> 21:15.920
That I could just eat lasagne
every day for the rest of my life

21:16.000 --> 21:17.920
and, don't worry, I don't imagine you
as a lasagne, when we're--

21:18.000 --> 21:19.600
Okay, Maurice, stop talking about lasagne.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.680
Yeah. Sorry. [clears throat] Just...

21:22.440 --> 21:23.480
Mmm...

21:24.000 --> 21:27.560
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
That's a lovely drop of vino.

21:33.920 --> 21:34.840
[Maurice exhales]

21:40.440 --> 21:41.400
[Deborah whispering] Maurice?

21:45.120 --> 21:46.080
Maurice?

21:52.560 --> 21:53.920
