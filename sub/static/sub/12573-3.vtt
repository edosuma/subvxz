00:00.010 --> 00:02.880
Previously on legend of the seeker...

00:03.340 --> 00:06.710
He is the first true seeker in the last thousand years.

00:06.720 --> 00:07.800
He has a destiny.

00:07.810 --> 00:09.960
Who are you to decide his destiny.

00:09.970 --> 00:10.780
It is not me.

00:10.790 --> 00:11.750
It is the prophesy.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.450
Prophecy be damned.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.010
So it doesn't matter Darken Rahl

00:15.020 --> 00:16.590
Is growing more powerful everyday.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.870
People in the midlands are losing freedom, dying by the thousands.

00:19.880 --> 00:20.710
Stop.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.120
What are you talking about?

00:22.660 --> 00:23.850
What's a seeker?

00:24.000 --> 00:29.340
Seeker is a hero who arises in a time of trouble and suffering.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.996
This is the sword of truth. In anyone else's hands it is a piece of steel,

00:33.997 --> 00:38.180
But in the seeker's hand bestows the power to fight evil.

00:38.180 --> 00:40.820
And with it you will kill darken rah

00:44.370 --> 00:48.290
Let it be known throughout the three territories,

00:48.290 --> 00:54.400
That whoever brings me the seeker, will be rewarded beyond imagining.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.940
-Any sign of them? -Only a burned out campfire.

01:13.050 --> 01:15.310
Did you follow the tracks leading away from it?

01:15.490 --> 01:17.120
They were too well covered.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.790
So you found nothing then.

01:19.150 --> 01:22.620
Just this, caught on some underbrush.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.650
So much for the bounty.

01:40.720 --> 01:41.930
It's his.

01:45.180 --> 01:47.660
Legend of the Seeker S01E03 Bounty

01:48.000 --> 01:49.040
There he is.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.270
You think you can steal food from lord rahl's army?

01:56.560 --> 01:57.400
I didn't steal anything.

01:57.410 --> 01:58.380
Liar.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.610
My men found the food in your barn.

02:02.340 --> 02:03.530
He was starving.

02:04.980 --> 02:07.340
Where is the rest of your band of thieves?

02:08.190 --> 02:09.840
I am the only one, there's no one else.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.810
How can I help you today, sir?

02:34.450 --> 02:35.510
I need a map.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.360
A map.

02:37.850 --> 02:39.540
I've got many maps.

02:40.670 --> 02:46.540
How about a map to the ruins of calabra, the twin barrier peaks,

02:46.541 --> 02:52.960
-false of the white plume, very popular. -I need a map to track someone.

02:55.290 --> 02:57.260
A map to track someone.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.210
Not sure a map like that actually exists.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.660
Of course, if it did, it would be very costly.

03:15.430 --> 03:18.770
I need something that belonged to the person you want it to track.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.260
Who did you say that pendant belonged to again?

04:31.660 --> 04:32.600
He's getting away.

04:32.610 --> 04:33.340
Whose fault is that?

04:33.350 --> 04:35.160
Then stay away from my...

04:35.170 --> 04:36.530
I waited, he didn't.

04:42.850 --> 04:43.930
Did I get it?

04:49.700 --> 04:51.270
So what's for dinner?

04:53.300 --> 04:56.400
Wizard of the first starter, really.

04:56.510 --> 04:59.010
I was hungry, it was getting away.

04:59.020 --> 05:01.480
You torched only game seen in two days.

05:01.490 --> 05:03.220
Here used to be plentiful in these parts.

05:03.230 --> 05:05.790
The D'Harans are over-hunting to feed the armies.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.210
Too bad it could get away from us yesterday.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.220
Don't remind me, Zedd.

05:09.230 --> 05:11.950
I lost my father's pendant chasing.

05:12.060 --> 05:14.240
Sorry, Richard, I know it meant a lot to you.

05:15.160 --> 05:15.800
Wait.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.040
Kahlen, no.

05:26.590 --> 05:27.470
Hold still.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.930
I'll find the ropes.

05:29.060 --> 05:30.620
And end up like that rabbit?

05:33.920 --> 05:35.050
Hurry, Zedd.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.070
Do it now.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.230
Don't move.

05:46.860 --> 05:47.980
The sword.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.780
I didn't agree to fight a wizard.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.310
Coward!

06:32.500 --> 06:33.760
I almost had him.

06:35.070 --> 06:37.020
Well, at least you got his money.

06:38.870 --> 06:40.530
He will be paying for dinner.

06:45.740 --> 06:46.620
What's that?

06:47.300 --> 06:48.250
A map.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.400
It is moving.

06:54.650 --> 06:56.440
Appears to have stopped.

06:59.540 --> 07:00.570
What's that light?

07:03.110 --> 07:04.380
I think it's you.

07:15.950 --> 07:17.830
A map that knows where I am?

07:18.060 --> 07:19.620
Cartographer is...

07:20.080 --> 07:22.760
Rare and powerful magic.

07:22.770 --> 07:26.490
Few know of its existence, much less its practice.

07:26.590 --> 07:28.030
Could Darken rahl made it?

07:28.040 --> 07:31.390
If rahl were tracking you, he wouldn't have sent the entire D'Hara army.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.070
You would be dead already.

07:33.290 --> 07:34.420
That's comforting.

07:34.430 --> 07:36.680
Luckily the map in our hands now.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.400
Well, you know it could be useful.

07:38.990 --> 07:41.060
If we got split up, you would know how to find me.

07:41.070 --> 07:43.750
Like those highway men did.Why would they know such a thing?

07:43.760 --> 07:44.970
Where did they get that?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.440
They weren't highway men.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.580
They were  bounty hunters.

07:52.910 --> 07:55.240
A thousand gold pieces for the seeker.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.472
If rahl is offering that kind of money, bounty hunters

07:58.473 --> 08:02.250
Won't be the only ones looking for you I'm telling you, it is him

08:05.020 --> 08:06.120
You're right.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.360
Let's go.

08:10.900 --> 08:11.330
It's him.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.020
The seeker is mine.

08:15.110 --> 08:16.340
We don't want any trouble.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.670
Trouble it is.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.890
Run!

08:23.900 --> 08:24.770
Now!

08:32.710 --> 08:34.059
Thank you for your help.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.190
Good to know that everyone in the town is against us.

08:38.340 --> 08:40.010
Are you really the seeker?

08:45.820 --> 08:46.740
Yes.

08:48.410 --> 08:49.800
Then I need your help.

08:51.570 --> 08:54.410
My little brother and I were attacked by a chadrin.

08:54.820 --> 08:56.620
It took him. A chadrin?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.480
One of the most feared creatures in the midlands.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.620
Few who have seen it have lived to describe it.

09:02.630 --> 09:03.580
It happened so fast.

09:03.590 --> 09:05.610
All I saw were claws and teeth.

09:06.620 --> 09:09.020
I thought the chadrin was a myth.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.820
Did the myth do this to me?

09:11.290 --> 09:13.870
I couldn't fight it off, I wasn't strong enough.

09:14.050 --> 09:16.660
And none of these cowards in the tavern would help me.

09:17.140 --> 09:21.864
The Chadrin hunt during the day, it keep their prey alive until night fall,

09:21.865 --> 09:27.090
Then they feed. Then there's still time.

09:27.390 --> 09:29.260
Please, you have to help him.

09:29.270 --> 09:30.300
He is just a boy.

09:30.310 --> 09:31.990
Where did the thing attack you?

09:32.110 --> 09:33.470
I can take you there.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.180
What about the people trying to collect the bounty on your head?

09:39.190 --> 09:42.050
You mean the ones trying to capture me when she stepped in?

09:42.960 --> 09:43.960
We can take care of ourselves.

09:43.970 --> 09:45.600
Lily's brother can't.

09:54.180 --> 09:56.420
Oh, here, you got my message.

09:56.530 --> 10:00.080
What makes you think I'll be so interested in one of your maps?

10:02.020 --> 10:06.070
Because this one will lead you to the seeker.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.460
You can be the one to claim the bounty.

10:11.810 --> 10:13.160
It will cost you.

10:19.430 --> 10:19.750
Great.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.160
I can buy a new quil.

10:36.750 --> 10:37.640
There you go.

10:38.010 --> 10:40.030
Careful, that's one of a kind.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.800
This is where it attacked us.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.890
Liam had skinned his knee.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.620
He was crying when I just came and took him.

10:51.630 --> 10:54.370
The Chadrin are nearly blind, they hunt by sound.

10:54.630 --> 10:56.500
Must have been drawn by your brother's cries.

10:56.510 --> 10:59.230
See if we can pick up its trail, then follow it back to the nest.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.460
The stories I heard, the chadrin build nests in caves.

11:03.610 --> 11:05.170
There are some caves up ahead.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.080
We don't have much time before sundown.

11:08.090 --> 11:09.480
Your right, we'd better hurry.

11:22.260 --> 11:25.880
My car threw a wheel, I could use some help getting it back on.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.270
I'm sorry, we have to help a boy in danger.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.440
We will come back if we can.

11:37.540 --> 11:38.760
Zedd, Get out of here.

11:38.770 --> 11:39.860
Richard!

12:51.140 --> 12:52.110
Another one.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.740
Where did you get this?

12:57.070 --> 12:59.110
You'd better answer the confessor.

13:00.350 --> 13:01.440
Serbastian

13:01.450 --> 13:02.940
The map maker in south Caston.

13:02.950 --> 13:03.990
If he's selling these maps,

13:04.000 --> 13:05.370
It's only a matter of time before we are ambushed

13:05.380 --> 13:06.680
By more of his customers.

13:06.690 --> 13:07.900
You can't risk helping me.

13:07.910 --> 13:09.190
You need to keep moving.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.840
The seeker is too important.

13:11.850 --> 13:13.530
No, we are going to find your brother.

13:13.540 --> 13:17.900
You go after Lily's brother and I will find this map maker.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.220
This will take me to the seeker.

13:22.230 --> 13:23.200
Yes.

13:24.130 --> 13:27.130
It is a one of a kind item, and as my best customer,

13:27.130 --> 13:29.200
I wanted to give you first chance at it.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.270
Happy hunting.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.960
Back so soon?

13:43.500 --> 13:44.740
I need another map.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.820
I can't.

13:46.830 --> 13:47.760
Why not?

13:49.530 --> 13:51.020
I'm out of ink,

13:51.020 --> 13:55.000
But if you have something else that belonged to the seeker,

13:55.108 --> 13:56.810
We can make it work.

13:57.590 --> 13:59.720
You had plenty of ink when I left here.

14:02.460 --> 14:04.610
You made more maps, didn't you?

14:04.610 --> 14:06.570
=Who did you sell them to? -I...I...

14:06.570 --> 14:10.240
I just sold the last one to the man that just left.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.670
He's markings on his face.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.060
If you leave now, you can catch him.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.760
Richard, look at this.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.240
We are not far from the next border.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.060
If we move beyond it,

14:29.060 --> 14:31.460
Anyone that has one of these won't be able to track you.

14:31.460 --> 14:34.530
We can double back to the north and cross the river.

14:35.380 --> 14:37.790
What about Lily's brother, the chadrin is in the other direction.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.120
You have a bigger destiny than helping one boy.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.840
Especially when he might already be dead.

14:49.230 --> 14:50.310
It is only a matter of time

14:54.910 --> 14:58.400
How are we to hunt darken rahl if we are being hunted ourselves.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.820
And running away is going to help?

15:01.800 --> 15:02.850
You will be alive.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.700
By sacrificing lily's brother.

15:06.790 --> 15:08.540
We've all made sacrifices.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.140
I lost my sister trying to find you and I don't regret that decision.

15:13.580 --> 15:18.260
I've sworn to protect you with my life, even from yourself.

15:18.270 --> 15:21.020
Richard, the cave is just a step ahead.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.760
Is something wrong?

15:25.740 --> 15:26.940
No, we're coming.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.210
Lily!

15:58.910 --> 16:00.030
Lily!

16:04.920 --> 16:06.180
We are closed.

16:08.580 --> 16:10.180
Not yet you're not.

16:13.050 --> 16:16.340
I hear you're selling maps to track the seeker.

16:18.580 --> 16:20.400
I don't know what you're talking about,

16:21.000 --> 16:26.540
But maybe I can interest you in a map of the ruins of calabra.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.160
Don't really know where you got that,

16:36.040 --> 16:37.130
Old man.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.723
You're going to tell me how you made this,

16:48.724 --> 16:52.270
How many you made, and who you sold them to. Um it's a bounty hunter

16:52.280 --> 16:54.150
He had a pendent, and said it belonged to the seeker.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.460
He said to make the map.

16:55.470 --> 16:56.720
How many did you make?

17:01.490 --> 17:02.330
One.

17:03.610 --> 17:04.819
Three.Three.

17:04.859 --> 17:06.300
I just sold the last one.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.599
Did you sell any to the D'Harans?

17:14.540 --> 17:15.569
Of course not.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.810
They don't buy maps.

17:19.589 --> 17:20.619
They take them.

17:21.339 --> 17:23.250
I loathe the D'Harans.

17:23.670 --> 17:25.020
And you would help them

17:25.020 --> 17:28.540
By aiding those that are capture the seeker for darken rahl.

17:29.150 --> 17:32.460
Where was the seeker when we were suffering under lord rahl?

17:32.820 --> 17:35.010
Did you know that I used to be in the service of kings

17:35.010 --> 17:36.810
And then the D'Harans moved in.

17:37.810 --> 17:39.580
I got to provide for my family.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.570
To do that, I make maps.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.880
Now you make one for me.

17:46.810 --> 17:49.920
I need to find the bounty hunter who bought the last map.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.140
Can't do it.

17:52.030 --> 17:55.570
Got to have something that belonged to him, something he valued greatly.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.410
He paid you, didn't he?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.140
What could be more valuable to a bounty hunter than his money.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.030
Lily?

18:23.320 --> 18:24.400
Lily!

18:27.880 --> 18:29.000
Lily!

19:04.810 --> 19:05.900
Kahlen!

19:19.660 --> 19:20.700
Kahlen?

19:20.770 --> 19:22.330
I left her back in the cave.

19:22.340 --> 19:23.990
You trapped her with that beast?

19:24.230 --> 19:26.850
Please, everyone knows a chadrin is in myth.

19:43.590 --> 19:45.720
This ought to lead you to the bounty hunter.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.390
If you leave now, you can catch him.

19:49.660 --> 19:50.980
I'll be leaving.

19:52.910 --> 19:55.820
But if you make any more maps to track the seeker,

19:56.800 --> 19:58.900
I'll be back.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.140
Richard!

23:23.350 --> 23:24.530
Why are you doing this?

23:24.540 --> 23:26.100
I was trying to help you.

23:26.710 --> 23:27.680
That's right.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.000
Because you're the seeker?

23:29.370 --> 23:31.650
I don't believe that fairy tale,

23:31.650 --> 23:33.665
But if the D'Harans do and they are willing to pay,

23:33.666 --> 23:35.350
All the better for me.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.430
Hoestyly, I don't see what they are so afraid of.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.970
They are afraid of the prophesy.

23:41.020 --> 23:45.140
Right.You are going to defeat darken rahl and save everyone in midlands.

23:45.150 --> 23:47.340
Right now, you are the only thing to stop me.

23:47.350 --> 23:48.960
And look how hard that was.

23:49.020 --> 23:50.980
The D'Harans don't need to send an army.

23:51.220 --> 23:54.070
All it takes is a few tears and an ample bosom.

24:08.710 --> 24:12.120
Hand over the map, and I'll let you live.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.390
How about this.

24:14.560 --> 24:18.280
You walk away, and I won't kill you.

24:47.890 --> 24:49.600
You can keep your half.

24:54.300 --> 24:55.280
Damn!

24:56.160 --> 24:59.330
You didn't think the seeker was going to stay in one place, did you?

25:36.640 --> 25:37.910
This is your lucky day.

25:38.880 --> 25:39.840
Do you see him?

25:40.300 --> 25:41.550
That's the seeker,

25:41.790 --> 25:45.600
You get to be the hero, go back to your captain and tell him I have him.

25:46.790 --> 25:49.200
If you want the seeker, meet me at demon rock,

25:49.210 --> 25:53.680
But tell him, I don't want the bounty, I want something else.

26:07.210 --> 26:10.800
Tell me, what's worth more to you than the bounty on the seeker?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.050
My brother.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.870
So I guess the chadrin didn't take him.

26:16.210 --> 26:17.250
No, worse.

26:17.260 --> 26:19.020
He was arrested by the D'Harans.

26:19.060 --> 26:21.100
They were going to execute him for stealing.

26:21.910 --> 26:22.990
Did he do it?

26:23.280 --> 26:24.520
No, I did.

26:24.530 --> 26:26.200
He confessed to protect me.

26:27.130 --> 26:28.360
So you're a thief?

26:28.800 --> 26:30.230
What choice do I have.

26:30.370 --> 26:33.611
The only food around here is what you can steal from D'Harans,

26:33.612 --> 26:36.980
It is steal or starve of and I am not going to starve.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.530
My brother is all I have left.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.580
I won't let daharans them kill him.

26:42.540 --> 26:44.910
Don't you see, I'm on your side.

26:45.220 --> 26:48.220
If you had told me the truth, I would have helped your brother.

26:48.460 --> 26:50.660
Maybe when you thought he was an innocent boy.

26:50.660 --> 26:52.610
With everyone trying to collect a bounty on you,

26:52.620 --> 26:56.120
If I asked you to ride into a D'Haran garrison to help a thief,

26:56.390 --> 26:57.650
Would you have said yes?

27:15.070 --> 27:16.610
Thought you might want some food.

27:23.570 --> 27:24.770
I know you're hungry.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.320
Sorry I hit you before.

27:32.090 --> 27:34.210
I just had to put on a good show in front of my men.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.750
It is okay, take it.

27:40.710 --> 27:41.780
No, no, no.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.260
Thank you.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.390
Fool.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.850
We hang thieves.

28:01.620 --> 28:03.380
We don't feed them up.

28:19.180 --> 28:22.140
Look, unshackle me,

28:22.360 --> 28:23.830
We can go back to Kahlan,

28:23.840 --> 28:25.820
And then we can all rescue your brother.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.340
Right.

28:27.350 --> 28:30.650
What guarantee do I have you won't take off as soon as I unshackle you?

28:32.920 --> 28:35.560
I give you my word as the seeker.

28:35.910 --> 28:38.480
That would mean something if I believed you were the seeker.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.720
The seeker is mine.

29:09.730 --> 29:10.990
Don't be a fool.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.740
There's no guarantee he is going to stay on one half of the map.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.010
What are you suggesting?

29:15.160 --> 29:16.260
We work together.

29:16.780 --> 29:19.730
We already split the map, let's split the bounty.

29:20.150 --> 29:21.490
Two against one.

29:22.470 --> 29:23.930
It's better odds.

29:25.510 --> 29:27.460
You agreed to that a little too quickly.

29:27.470 --> 29:29.210
How do I know you're not trying to trick me.

29:29.220 --> 29:31.180
You suggested too quickly.

29:31.190 --> 29:33.290
How do I know you're not trying to trick me.

29:33.310 --> 29:34.310
All right.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.660
Longer we argue, more time the seeker has to escape.

29:37.970 --> 29:41.020
We just gonna have to trust each other.

30:41.900 --> 30:43.760
Kahlan!

30:51.280 --> 30:52.620
Richard!

31:21.580 --> 31:22.340
Are you hurt?

31:22.350 --> 31:23.940
I am fine, how about you?

31:28.200 --> 31:31.800
Next time, when I tell you we can't help someone,

31:32.740 --> 31:35.450
Don't trust them, trust me.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.580
She was very convincing.

31:38.580 --> 31:39.670
Yes, she was.

31:40.770 --> 31:44.490
Kahlen, I'm so sorry I got you into all of this.

31:45.150 --> 31:46.600
Apology accepted.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.940
Move!

32:04.470 --> 32:06.820
On the ground, confessor.

32:09.230 --> 32:11.070
Do you think you'll get something for her, too?

32:11.080 --> 32:14.810
Once we collect on the seeker, there'll be plenty for both of us.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.810
Until he double crosses you.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.160
Who are you?

32:21.380 --> 32:23.480
Someone who knows this man a lot better than you do.

32:23.490 --> 32:25.010
I've never seen this woman before.

32:25.020 --> 32:27.000
We can share the bounty,

32:28.290 --> 32:30.500
And whatever else you might be interested in.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.610
Don't listen to her.

32:35.350 --> 32:37.460
What kind of deal are we talking about?

32:37.540 --> 32:39.840
I knew you would stab me in the back!

32:40.480 --> 32:42.540
I won't be so gentle.

32:51.830 --> 32:53.380
Where do you think you're going?

33:02.170 --> 33:06.270
Well, let's takes care of all three maps.

33:07.540 --> 33:11.000
Even so there's still a bounty on your head. We should get going.

33:11.010 --> 33:12.720
What are we gonna do about her?

33:12.720 --> 33:14.320
You may as well kill me.

33:14.630 --> 33:16.950
If I don't deliver the seeker to the D'Harans,

33:16.950 --> 33:18.600
My brother is as good as dead.

33:21.680 --> 33:22.980
What are you doing?

33:24.360 --> 33:27.040
Keeping my promise, I'm going to save her brother.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.610
Have you learned nothing?

33:30.670 --> 33:33.000
She tried to feed me to a chadrin.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.580
She thought it was a myth.

33:34.590 --> 33:37.060
She tried to sell you to the D'Harans.

33:37.110 --> 33:38.540
She is trying to save her brother.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.020
And you believe her.

33:40.230 --> 33:42.310
Everything out of her mouth has been a lie.

33:43.100 --> 33:46.880
Zed, tell me you don't trust this woman.

33:46.890 --> 33:48.100
No.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.630
But I do trust richard.

33:50.640 --> 33:54.540
And people must know that the seeker will stand and fight for them.

33:54.550 --> 33:56.490
What has she done to deserve our help.

33:56.780 --> 33:58.800
How do we decide who deserves our help.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.580
She'll be enough if she needs it.

34:00.590 --> 34:02.270
Don't be naive.

34:02.510 --> 34:03.780
This isn't Westland.

34:03.790 --> 34:04.620
Exactly.

34:04.630 --> 34:06.750
Darken Rahl has forced people from the Midlands

34:06.750 --> 34:08.449
To do anything to just survive.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.940
Including serving you up to the D'Harans.

34:10.949 --> 34:15.739
Richard, people like her are only looking out for themselves.

34:15.750 --> 34:20.020
And if the seeker just stand up for himself, what chance do they have.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.150
Sir,

34:24.460 --> 34:26.139
I know where the seeker is.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.199
Why haven't you brought him to me.

34:28.210 --> 34:29.610
He has been captured.

34:29.710 --> 34:30.469
By whom?

34:30.480 --> 34:31.840
A woman has him.

34:32.120 --> 34:32.929
A woman?

34:32.940 --> 34:34.590
Yes, sir.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.350
She doesn't want the bounty.

34:37.969 --> 34:39.429
What does she want?

34:48.500 --> 34:51.750
Two patrols along the perimeter, four sentries at the main gate.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.560
A few dozens of D'Harans inside.

34:53.570 --> 34:55.060
I think this can work.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.020
It's a smart plan, richard.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.970
It all depends on trusting lily.

35:01.740 --> 35:04.831
If she is lying to us, you will be captured and killed.

35:05.032 --> 35:08.432
And darken rahl will win.

35:20.832 --> 35:22.350
What is it you want?

35:22.360 --> 35:24.320
You are holding a prisoner named liam.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.380
You release him, you can have the seeker

35:26.390 --> 35:28.030
Where is the seeker?

35:28.170 --> 35:30.180
This map will take you there.

35:30.190 --> 35:32.830
If you hurry, you can get the confessor and the wizard as well.

35:33.010 --> 35:34.120
But if you want it,

35:34.130 --> 35:35.720
I want to see my brother.

35:37.430 --> 35:38.590
Very well.

35:39.150 --> 35:40.900
Take her to her brother.

35:46.730 --> 35:48.440
We had an agreement!

36:00.460 --> 36:02.000
We had an agreement!

36:04.090 --> 36:05.620
You bastards!

36:08.880 --> 36:10.070
Lily?

36:10.740 --> 36:11.800
Liam!

36:14.770 --> 36:16.230
What have they done to you?

36:16.530 --> 36:17.730
I'm all right.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.470
What are you doing here?

36:19.480 --> 36:20.840
Trying to get you out.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.110
All I wanted is you to be safe.

36:24.590 --> 36:26.910
I couldn't standby and let them execute you.

36:27.730 --> 36:29.150
Now what?

36:30.500 --> 36:31.960
We both die?

36:33.510 --> 36:34.650
Not today.

36:40.910 --> 36:42.820
I want every available man ready.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.460
We are going after the seeker.

37:06.850 --> 37:10.070
Seeker is up ahead, this way.

37:46.630 --> 37:48.280
Come on. Let's go

38:27.380 --> 38:28.550
Come on, men.

38:30.060 --> 38:31.560
The seeker isn't here.

38:44.190 --> 38:45.380
That's not the seeker.

38:50.180 --> 38:51.490
We've been tricked.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.780
Guess it is hard that they believed you gave them the right map.

39:16.950 --> 39:18.260
It wasn't that hard convincing them.

39:18.270 --> 39:20.670
I am a devious, conniving woman.

39:25.350 --> 39:27.650
I want to thank you for saving my brother.

39:28.350 --> 39:30.290
I mean, despite the fact that I lied to you.

39:30.300 --> 39:33.190
And tried to sell me to the D'Harans and kill my friends.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.310
And those are just the things you know about.

39:36.630 --> 39:38.430
You did all this just to help us.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.170
He is the seeker.

39:41.910 --> 39:43.780
Richard, we should get moving.

39:44.240 --> 39:47.180
If you ever come back this way, maybe we will see each other again.

39:47.420 --> 39:48.740
You better hope not.

40:00.170 --> 40:03.630
They have no intention of paying the bounty on the seeker.

40:03.640 --> 40:07.860
Anyone tries to collect will find himself inside a D'Haran prison cell.

40:08.340 --> 40:09.280
Besides,

40:09.290 --> 40:12.260
The seeker is on our side, he is fighting for us.

40:12.270 --> 40:14.420
The least we can do is help him out.

40:46.010 --> 40:47.160
How did you do that?

40:47.330 --> 40:49.520
It's called lenitive magic.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.320
Try to hold on to it this time.

40:55.820 --> 40:59.100
It is the only thing I have of my father's.

40:59.490 --> 41:01.680
I'm not letting it out of my sight again.

41:07.730 --> 41:10.251
Kahlan, I just want you to know that

41:10.251 --> 41:12.860
I really appreciate you looking out for me.

41:15.670 --> 41:20.630
Well, if you had listened to me, that boy would have been executed.

41:22.110 --> 41:23.400
You saved him.

41:26.060 --> 41:30.250
After living under rahl for so long, people have forgotten what a hero is.

41:31.100 --> 41:33.160
But you stood up and fought for them.

41:34.410 --> 41:35.930
Word will spread.

41:38.880 --> 41:41.840
The people will know that the seeker has returned.

41:45.300 --> 41:47.380
We should get going soon.

41:47.900 --> 41:49.690
Oh, come on, what's the hurry.

41:49.700 --> 41:52.670
If you're going to need to rescue every damn little distress,

41:52.670 --> 41:54.600
There's no time to waste.
