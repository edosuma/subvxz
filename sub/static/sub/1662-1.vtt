14:49.522 --> 14:50.922
So tell me what you did wrong.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.364
What's the lesson
to be learned here?

14:53.058 --> 14:54.626
Never trust a Vulcan.

14:54.628 --> 14:57.061
Now, see, you can't even
answer the question. You lied.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.163
On an official report,
you lied.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.398
You think the rules
don't apply to you

15:00.400 --> 15:02.300
'cause you disagree with them.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.635
That's why you talked me into
signing up in the first place.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.370
It's why you gave me your ship.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.939
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.

15:09.308 --> 15:12.010
And now, I see you haven't
got an ounce of humility.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.111
What was I supposed to do,
let Spock die?

15:13.113 --> 15:14.913
You're missing the point.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.247
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.949
I wouldn't have risked
my First Officer's life

15:17.951 --> 15:19.450
in the first place!

15:19.452 --> 15:21.219
You were supposed
to survey a planet,

15:21.221 --> 15:23.488
not alter its destiny!

15:23.490 --> 15:25.556
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations

15:25.558 --> 15:27.525
and almost got everyone
under your command killed.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.427
Except I didn't!

15:29.429 --> 15:31.162
You know how many crew
members I've lost? Not one!

15:31.164 --> 15:32.931
That's your problem,
you think you're infallible!

15:32.933 --> 15:34.065
You think you can't
make a mistake.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.466
It's a pattern with you!

15:35.468 --> 15:37.669
The rules are for other people!
Some should be.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.370
And what's worse
is you using blind luck

15:39.372 --> 15:41.205
to justify your playing God!

15:44.610 --> 15:46.511
Given the circumstances,

15:46.513 --> 15:48.446
this has been brought to
Admiral Marcus's attention.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.182
He convened a special tribunal,
to which I was not invited.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.584

regulations mandate

23:44.457 --> 23:45.923
One hour ago,

23:45.925 --> 23:47.858
I received a message
from a Starfleet officer,

23:47.860 --> 23:50.161
who confessed to
carrying out this attack,

23:50.163 --> 23:52.696
that he was being
forced to do it by this man,

23:52.698 --> 23:55.900
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.063
And he is the man responsible
for this act of savagery.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.205
For reasons unknown, John
Harrison has just declared

24:01.207 --> 24:04.608
a one-man war
against Starfleet.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.745
And under no circumstances
are we to allow this man

24:07.747 --> 24:10.548
to escape Federation space.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.916
You here tonight represent
the senior command

24:11.918 --> 24:13.951
of all the vessels
in the region.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.520
And in the name
of those we lost,

24:16.522 --> 24:18.189
you will run this bastard down.

24:19.658 --> 24:23.627
This is a manhunt, pure and
simple, so let's get to work.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.596
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

24:25.598 --> 24:27.097
any warp signatures
leaving the system,

24:27.099 --> 24:28.180
so we know he can't be far.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.169
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

24:32.171 --> 24:34.472
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

24:34.474 --> 24:37.875
to run down every lead.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.510

to kill innocent people,

24:39.512 --> 24:42.079
so the rules of engagement
are simple.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.949
If you come across this man
and fear for your life

24:44.951 --> 24:47.084
or the lives of those nearby,

24:47.086 --> 24:50.020
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

James, not now.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.991

that he'd target an archive?

is public record.

to damage Starfleet,

Uh, we're not sure, sir.

31:12.104 --> 31:13.503

in the Ketha Province,

for decades.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.440
He's gotta be
hiding there, sir!

He knows if we even
go near Klingon space,

31:17.643 --> 31:19.176

31:19.178 --> 31:21.011

but I can.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.213
Please, sir.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.518
All-out war with the Klingons
is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.187
If you ask me,
it's already begun.

of their existence,

31:31.657 --> 31:33.657

has conquered and occupied

31:33.659 --> 31:35.259
two planets that we know of

31:35.261 --> 31:37.227
and fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.964
They are coming our way.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.903
London was not an archive.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.271
It was a top-secret
branch of Starfleet

31:47.273 --> 31:50.207

31:50.209 --> 31:51.942
They were developing

31:51.944 --> 31:53.911

to gather intelligence

31:53.913 --> 31:55.178

Harrison was one
of our top agents.

Well, now he's a fugitive
and I want to take him out.

32:03.488 --> 32:05.689

one of our best and brightest.

heard him defend you.

joining Starfleet, wasn't he?

Yes, sir.

is uninhabited?

32:30.249 --> 32:31.048
Affirmative, sir.

As part of our

33:47.226 --> 33:48.986

to our mission parameters.

33:49.094 --> 33:53.663
There is no Starfleet regulation that
condemns a man to die without a trial,

33:53.665 --> 33:56.433
something you and Admiral
Marcus are forgetting.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.769
Also, preemptively
firing torpedoes

33:58.771 --> 34:00.470
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

34:00.472 --> 34:02.172
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.535
There's only gonna be
one casualty.

34:03.742 --> 34:07.244
Our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.812
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

34:08.813 --> 34:12.349
Regulations aside, this
action is morally wrong.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.583
Regulations aside, pulling your ass

find my opinion valid.

I understand your concerns,

but we need these
torpedoes on board.

35:49.882 --> 35:52.382
Due respect, sir, but photon
torpedoes run on fuel.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.151
Now, I cannot detect
the type of fuel

35:54.153 --> 35:55.652
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

35:55.654 --> 35:57.187
because it's shielded.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.589
Now, I asked for the
specifications, but he said...

35:59.591 --> 36:01.525

Do you know what this is?
It's a warp core.

36:25.450 --> 36:28.518
It's a radioactive catastrophe
waiting to happen.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.620
A subtle shift
in magnetic output

36:30.622 --> 36:33.323
from, say, firing one or
more of six dozen torpedoes

36:33.325 --> 36:35.192
with an unknown payload

36:35.194 --> 36:36.426
could set off a chain
reaction which would kill

36:36.428 --> 36:38.628

on this ship.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.830
Letting those torpedoes on board

How about Starfleet confiscating
my transwarp equation?

it to hop across the galaxy!

Your new science officer

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:36.786
concealed her identity
to board the ship.

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.955

going to tell me that?

As it just did.

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:43.525
Are the torpedoes
in the weapons bay?

Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:46.828
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:48.063

My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:02.344
then I heard he was developing
these prototype torpedoes.

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:04.012
Uh-huh. When I went to
confront him about it,

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:06.248
he wouldn't even see me.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.016

torpedoes had disappeared

from all official records.

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:12.888
And then he gave them to me.

You're much cleverer than your
reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

Genetically engineered

so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:17.385
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.455

things would be different.

But as a result
of the destruction of Vulcan,

01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:30.532
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.233

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.801

John Harrison was a fiction

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:45.412
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:48.383

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.220
Khan.

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:01.529
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:05.200
ask a 300-year-old
frozen man for help?

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:07.902
Because I am better.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:10.205
At what?
Everything.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.209
Alexander Marcus
needed to respond to

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:16.277
an uncivilized threat
in a civilized time

01:10:16.279 --> 01:10:18.413
and for that
he needed a warrior's mind.

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.281
My mind.

01:10:20.283 --> 01:10:22.483
To design weapons and warships.

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:24.586
<font color="#808080">SPOCK:</font> You are suggesting
the Admiral

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:26.621

simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

01:10:28.792 --> 01:10:31.426
He wanted to exploit
my savagery.

01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:34.229
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:35.797

How would you be
expected to break bone?

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:42.637
Marcus used me
to design weapons.

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:45.406
To help him realize his vision
of a militarized Starfleet.

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:48.476
He sent you
to use those weapons.

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:51.879
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:56.284
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:59.854
in enemy space, leading to
one inevitable outcome.

01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:01.456
The Klingons
would come searching

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:03.491
for whomever was responsible,

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:05.793
and you would have
no chance of escape.

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:09.964
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:11.633
The war he always wanted.

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:13.635
No. No.

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:18.873
I watched you open fire in a room
full of unarmed Starfleet officers.

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:20.808
You killed them in cold blood!

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:23.444
Marcus took my crew from me.

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:25.747
You are a murderer!

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:27.982
He used my friends
to control me.

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:35.490
I tried to smuggle them
to safety

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:36.924
by concealing them
in the very weapons

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:38.593
I had designed,

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:42.397
but I was discovered.

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:47.402
I had no choice
but to escape alone.

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:53.541
And when I did, I had
every reason to suspect

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:57.845
that Marcus had killed
every single one

01:11:57.847 --> 01:12:00.848

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:07.555
