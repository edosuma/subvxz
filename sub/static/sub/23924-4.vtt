00:02.168 --> 00:06.105
Dad, is your job as fun as
eating cereal?!

00:06.139 --> 00:08.219
Oh, no.

00:08.298 --> 00:08.807
Huh?

00:08.841 --> 00:12.652
Aah! Mr. Pickles got a bunch
of animals glued to me!

00:12.770 --> 00:15.014
Really? Mr. Pickles glued ani...

00:15.067 --> 00:18.417
No! He told them to do it themselves!

00:18.449 --> 00:20.820
Mr. Pickles can speak to animals!

00:20.853 --> 00:22.488
He's evil!

00:24.522 --> 00:26.492
Aah! Damn you, Mr...

Hi! I'm selling guitar
weed wackers today, and...

00:36.217 --> 00:38.303
Well, I don't know why you'd need one.

00:38.336 --> 00:39.831
Hello?

00:39.884 --> 00:41.541
Goodman, you stink!

00:41.574 --> 00:44.043
Yeah,
you're the worst telemarketer ever.

00:44.075 --> 00:46.778
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Y-Y-Y-You suck.

00:46.812 --> 00:49.047
But these products are ridiculous.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.349
Nobody else complains.

00:50.382 --> 00:55.053
You just have to act like
these products are great.

00:55.086 --> 00:57.857
It's called acting, so make some sales,

00:57.889 --> 01:00.725
or go wash dishes for a living.

01:01.335 --> 01:02.377
Huh?

01:02.496 --> 01:05.297
Uh, are y'all dishwashers?

01:05.330 --> 01:07.299
No, we're telemarketers.

01:07.332 --> 01:10.903
Then you're exactly
who we're looking for.

01:13.504 --> 01:15.741
- Hey, no!
- Hyah!

01:15.773 --> 01:17.008
Hey! Where are you taking us?!

01:17.041 --> 01:19.879
Shut up, telemarketer! Get walking!

01:27.552 --> 01:30.554
Where are you taking us?!

01:30.805 --> 01:32.891
Stanley!

01:32.924 --> 01:34.526
Where could Stanley be at this hour?

01:34.559 --> 01:36.728
Huh? Footprints.

01:36.761 --> 01:39.599
You sure have a good sense of smell...
Ah!

01:39.632 --> 01:42.227
Come on, Mr. Pickles.

01:44.436 --> 01:46.439
Where the heck are we?!

01:47.860 --> 01:52.612
Welcome. My name is Mr. Montgomery.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.948
Well,
why the heck did you bring us here?!

01:56.981 --> 01:59.751
Well, my father once owned this farm,

01:59.785 --> 02:03.244
and, oh, what a wonderful life it was.

02:03.336 --> 02:06.925
Oh, what a wonderful life this is.

02:06.958 --> 02:08.693
Then, one day, the phone rang.

02:08.726 --> 02:09.794
Huh?

02:09.828 --> 02:12.231
- Someone called a "telemarketer."
- Hello? No, thanks.

02:12.263 --> 02:14.600
Father was polite at first,

02:14.632 --> 02:16.736
but after that, he couldn't do anything

02:16.768 --> 02:20.002
- without telemarketers interrupting.
- Hello? No I'm not interested.

02:20.055 --> 02:23.208
- Not made love to my mother,
- Hello?

02:23.242 --> 02:25.111
nor to Uncle Dimples.

02:25.143 --> 02:26.278
Leave me alone!

02:26.311 --> 02:28.748
And when it came time
to pay the workers,

02:28.780 --> 02:31.983
the phone rang,
and he dropped the money into the well!

02:32.017 --> 02:35.621
Workers drowned.
Father couldn't farm the land hisself.

02:35.654 --> 02:38.724
- Another telemarketer!
- And we had no food!

02:38.756 --> 02:41.559
Mother begged him... No more answering!

02:41.592 --> 02:44.130
So, he decided he wouldn't.

02:44.162 --> 02:46.165
- But then he did!
- Hello?!

02:46.197 --> 02:49.100
He was instantly engulfed in flames.

02:49.133 --> 02:52.270
He ran to the well,
but the phone rang again.

02:52.304 --> 02:54.607
Maybe it's not a telemarketer this time!

02:54.639 --> 02:57.008
I'll never forget his last words.

02:57.042 --> 03:00.146
Telemarketers are the devil!

03:00.179 --> 03:02.615
Make them pay!

03:02.648 --> 03:08.120
So, from this day forth,
you devils belong to me.

03:08.153 --> 03:09.155
What?!

03:09.187 --> 03:11.647
Aw, I knew that's where this was going.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.692
Stanley!

03:13.726 --> 03:15.828
Stanley! Hyah! Hup!

03:15.861 --> 03:18.663
Hi. Have you seen any telemarketers?

03:18.697 --> 03:21.634
They're property of Montgomery Farm now,

03:21.667 --> 03:22.768
so beat it.

03:28.540 --> 03:31.310
I'm sorry. You were saying?!

03:31.342 --> 03:32.544
Don't shoot us!

03:32.578 --> 03:34.213
Come on, Mr. Pickles!

03:34.245 --> 03:36.281
- Get her!
- Okay!

03:36.315 --> 03:37.350
Ugh.

03:40.051 --> 03:41.853
Not the dog, you Dum Dum!

03:41.886 --> 03:45.824
- But doggy tell horsey steal our guns.
- Huh?

03:45.858 --> 03:50.695
What if a doggy bark sounds
like words to animals?

03:50.729 --> 03:54.033
How dumb are you?!

03:56.801 --> 03:59.504
Goodman,
I thought you were a bad telemarketer,

03:59.538 --> 04:02.441
but you're even worse at farming!

04:02.473 --> 04:03.675
Do it like this!

04:03.709 --> 04:05.811
Quiet! We don't want trouble!

04:05.843 --> 04:08.513
No, do it like this, or you're fired!

04:08.546 --> 04:10.282
Who's making that noise?!

04:10.316 --> 04:11.516
- It was him.
- What?

04:11.550 --> 04:12.685
- Him right there.
- Hey.

04:12.717 --> 04:15.454
Okay. He just got you all a cording.

04:15.487 --> 04:17.456
No, wait. It wasn't me.

04:17.488 --> 04:19.391
No, I've been a good, uh, telemarketer.

04:26.365 --> 04:28.718
Mmm, save that for later.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.635
Devil on the run!

04:30.668 --> 04:32.538
I'll be back... for all of you!

04:32.571 --> 04:34.307
Get him!

04:34.339 --> 04:36.374
We gon' get you, devil!

04:41.747 --> 04:43.516
Hey, where'd he go?

04:49.216 --> 04:54.227
Just saying,
what if the doggy talked to animals?

04:54.259 --> 04:56.829
Ain't no dog can talk to animals!

04:56.862 --> 05:01.067
Doggy wake up.
Best eat him 'fore he talk to animals.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.069
Oh, that's it!
I can't take this anymore!

05:03.101 --> 05:04.836
Just throw him in that snake pit!

05:04.870 --> 05:07.740
But what if doggy talks to snakes?

05:07.773 --> 05:09.442
You dumb-dumb! The dog don't talk!

05:09.475 --> 05:11.711
Besides, snakes ain't got ears!

05:11.744 --> 05:13.412
How do they listen?

05:13.444 --> 05:15.680
Snakes hear through vibrations!

05:15.713 --> 05:17.583
I ain't got time to
explain everything to you!

05:17.615 --> 05:19.584
Now, just get the dog in the pit!

05:19.617 --> 05:22.521
Bye, doggy.

05:30.461 --> 05:35.700
Now, for trying to escape,
you shall be hanged dead.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.603
Goodman, this isn't easy,

05:37.636 --> 05:40.306
but I do feel an apology is in order.

05:40.338 --> 05:42.774
Boss, no need to apologize.

05:42.807 --> 05:44.743
No, an apology from you

05:44.776 --> 05:47.413
for being such a terrible telemarketer!

05:47.446 --> 05:49.315
Oh, just hang me.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.449
Okay!

05:53.117 --> 05:54.786
Hello!

05:55.175 --> 05:57.322
Livingston Bumblesworth?

06:00.153 --> 06:02.228
Uh, to what do we owe the honor?

06:02.261 --> 06:03.629
Just passing by.

06:03.661 --> 06:06.598
Can't control your telemarketers, I see.

06:08.466 --> 06:09.935
No, no, no.

06:09.968 --> 06:12.638
We were just preparing for a play!

06:12.670 --> 06:14.307
- Play?
- Yes.

06:14.339 --> 06:19.277
Uh, a play to show you just
how well my farm is driving.

06:19.310 --> 06:20.445
Cut him down!

06:29.687 --> 06:31.690
Snakes hear through vibrations!

06:31.723 --> 06:33.959
Vibrations!

06:49.040 --> 06:51.843
So, what's the vibration?

06:51.877 --> 06:54.116
Oh, for the last time, you dumb-dumb,

06:54.211 --> 06:56.549
a vibration is the oscillation
of the parts of a fluid

06:56.581 --> 06:59.685
or an elastic solid whose
equilibrium has been disturbed

06:59.718 --> 07:02.388
as it can transmit
sounds that can be felt!

07:02.420 --> 07:03.759
Huh?

07:05.500 --> 07:08.994
Now, you going to see how
well I'm doing, Bumblesworth.

07:09.859 --> 07:11.029
Start the play.

07:11.062 --> 07:14.466
Montgomery Farm is grape.

07:14.499 --> 07:15.634
Great!

07:15.666 --> 07:16.835
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:16.869 --> 07:20.996
Uh, isn't Mr. Montgomery powerful?

07:21.217 --> 07:23.509
Why, here he comes now.

07:23.541 --> 07:25.043
Now! Whoa!

07:25.076 --> 07:26.379
Oh.

07:26.411 --> 07:28.880
I'm Mr. Montgomery,

07:28.913 --> 07:31.649
and I'm a great farmer.

07:31.682 --> 07:33.385
Well, that's just like me.

07:33.418 --> 07:35.221
Actually...

07:35.254 --> 07:38.924
I just sit on my big fat ass all day

07:38.956 --> 07:42.560
because I can't do anything by myself.

07:42.593 --> 07:43.896
What?!

07:43.928 --> 07:45.864
Now, that's more like you!

07:45.898 --> 07:49.100
What?! Hey, running a farm is hard!

07:49.134 --> 07:51.003
That's son of a no good telemarketer

07:51.036 --> 07:52.405
would know nothing about it.

07:52.437 --> 07:55.039
Well,
why don't you try being a telemarketer

07:55.072 --> 07:57.409
and sell me something?

07:57.442 --> 07:58.777
What?! Never!

07:58.810 --> 08:02.247
Oh, come now!
This is quite entertaining!

08:02.281 --> 08:05.384
Hmm. All right. Bum, bum, bum.

08:05.416 --> 08:06.418
Ring!

08:06.451 --> 08:08.687
- Montgomery speaking.
- Hello.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.689
I'm a dumb telemarketer, and...

08:10.721 --> 08:12.724
- Not interested! Goodbye!
- Huh?

08:12.757 --> 08:14.759
But you didn't let me

08:14.793 --> 08:16.694
tell you what I was selling yet!

08:16.728 --> 08:17.930
Ring, ring!

08:17.963 --> 08:20.132
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me again.

08:20.165 --> 08:21.567
Take me off your list!

08:23.668 --> 08:25.236
Well, that was rude of him.

08:25.269 --> 08:26.738
- Ring!
- Hello?

08:26.771 --> 08:28.240
Like I was saying...

08:28.273 --> 08:31.576
I'm not home right now,
so leave a message after the beep.

08:31.610 --> 08:32.711
Beep!

08:34.446 --> 08:36.881
Hey! Well, this is very frustrating.

08:36.914 --> 08:38.950
See? It's not easy being

08:38.984 --> 08:40.285
me,

08:40.318 --> 08:43.254
trying to sell guitar
weed wackers all day.

08:43.288 --> 08:44.889
Guitar weed wackers?

08:44.923 --> 08:46.225
Who'd want that?

08:46.258 --> 08:48.661
- Uhh...
- Goodman, you got it.

08:48.693 --> 08:49.961
Yeah!

08:49.995 --> 08:52.664
Uh, I use my guitar weed
wacker all the time!

08:52.697 --> 08:54.132
Nothing like playing some tunes

08:54.166 --> 08:56.135
while you're wacking some weeds.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.104
Huh, I've always wanted to play guitar,

08:59.137 --> 09:01.340
and if it was fun enough
to wack the weeds,

09:01.373 --> 09:03.943
I wouldn't need telemarketers!

09:03.975 --> 09:07.612
Today, I've realized that
farmers and telemarketers

09:07.645 --> 09:09.113
aren't so different.

09:09.147 --> 09:13.185
I hereby declare all telemarketers free!

09:14.352 --> 09:17.455
And I'll take a guitar weed wacker, too!

09:18.856 --> 09:19.991
Just let me get my wallet!

09:20.024 --> 09:21.459
- Huh?
- Listen up!

09:21.493 --> 09:25.129
I'm taking these telemarketers with me!

09:25.163 --> 09:26.999
Honey! Honey! Everything is good now!

09:27.032 --> 09:28.334
What are you doing?!

09:28.366 --> 09:30.502
You double-crossing telemarketer devil!

09:30.535 --> 09:32.037
Kill them all!

09:33.071 --> 09:34.440
Oh! Oh.

09:35.202 --> 09:36.975
Hey, where'd that snake come from?!

09:37.009 --> 09:38.177
Aah! Aah!

09:38.210 --> 09:41.013
Huh? Oh! That's the devil!

09:45.750 --> 09:47.886
What the hell's he doing?

09:48.109 --> 09:49.387
Get him!

09:51.056 --> 09:53.158
Huh? What the hell?

10:07.395 --> 10:09.874
Doggy can't talk to snakes!

10:09.908 --> 10:11.377
Stop dancing, Dum Dum, and help me!

10:11.409 --> 10:16.414
The snakes just like the
beat of his vibrations!

10:16.447 --> 10:17.882
You be a good boy now!

10:17.916 --> 10:19.830
Aah!!

10:22.187 --> 10:24.056
There you are, Mr. Pickles.

10:24.273 --> 10:27.426
Gee, I hope everybody's okay in there.

10:27.861 --> 10:31.195
Goodman, you did save us all,
so from now on,

10:31.229 --> 10:34.199
I won't give you such a hard time.

10:34.231 --> 10:36.100
Really? Well, thank...

10:36.134 --> 10:37.570
Aah! Get away from here, snake!

10:37.602 --> 10:42.240
Snakes don't have ears to hear you,
dumb-dumb!

10:42.274 --> 10:43.576
Huh...

10:43.609 --> 10:45.009
Hey, good afternoon.

10:45.043 --> 10:47.679
I'm selling guitar weed
wackers today. I...

10:47.712 --> 10:49.014
Hello?

10:49.047 --> 10:53.018
Make some sales,
or you're fired, dumb-dumb!
