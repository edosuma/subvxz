00:01.814 --> 00:02.347
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...

00:02.381 --> 00:03.482
Oh my God.

00:03.516 --> 00:04.716
- The crew that Nacho runs with,
- _

00:04.750 --> 00:07.419
they can do a lot more than
throw bricks through your window.

00:07.453 --> 00:08.420
I'm moving in.

00:08.454 --> 00:09.454
- But...
- I'm not gonna let

00:09.489 --> 00:11.289
anything happen to you or Daphne.

00:11.357 --> 00:13.725
Hi, I'm Sarah Lazar. I'm
a friend of your dad's.

00:13.759 --> 00:16.461
Sarah is writing a book about the switch.

00:16.496 --> 00:18.463
She's writing my story.

00:24.586 --> 00:26.433
_

00:26.434 --> 00:28.921
_

00:29.622 --> 00:31.538
_

00:31.547 --> 00:32.577
What about Tank?

00:32.612 --> 00:33.712
I depledged the fraternity.

00:33.746 --> 00:35.514
I'm gone. I'm out. It's over.

00:35.548 --> 00:38.650
He depledged as some kind
of grand gesture for me.

00:38.851 --> 00:41.040
_

00:41.053 --> 00:42.354
For now.

00:42.388 --> 00:43.755
Bay's laptop was on the couch.

00:43.789 --> 00:46.458
- What came up?
- "Where can I buy

00:46.492 --> 00:47.759
the morning-after pill?"

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

01:00.773 --> 01:03.608
- Hey.
-  Hey.

01:03.643 --> 01:04.709
Come in.

01:08.347 --> 01:09.481
So, uh, how's the moving going?

01:09.515 --> 01:11.750
I should be out by tomorrow night.

01:11.784 --> 01:13.718
There's gonna be a lot of
empty walls in my new dorm room.

01:13.753 --> 01:15.353
I was hoping maybe you could

01:15.388 --> 01:17.322
loan me one of the
paintings in your studio?

01:17.356 --> 01:21.393
Tank, you're an amazing, incredible guy...

01:21.427 --> 01:22.761
I think you're amazing, too.

01:22.795 --> 01:25.697
... but I think we should
go back to being friends.

01:25.731 --> 01:29.434
- What?
- I just think we were better that way.

01:29.468 --> 01:31.536
Remember how much fun we used to have?

01:31.571 --> 01:33.672
I feel like being in a relationship has...

01:33.706 --> 01:35.574
kind of ruined that.

01:37.343 --> 01:38.543
You're breaking up with me?

01:43.749 --> 01:45.584
Is it because of that army guy?

01:45.618 --> 01:46.751
Or... or Emmett?

01:48.521 --> 01:49.487
No.

01:50.623 --> 01:52.591
Come on, you and I... we're so different.

01:52.625 --> 01:53.792
Which is what I thought made us work.

01:53.826 --> 01:55.560
We were fighting all the time.

01:55.595 --> 01:56.761
We only fought about the fraternity.

01:56.796 --> 01:59.364
- That's gone now.
- It wasn't just about that.

01:59.398 --> 02:01.499
Do you even care that I depledged for you?

02:01.534 --> 02:04.569
Okay, you said you made
that decision on your own.

02:04.604 --> 02:07.339
You said you came home and the
bathroom was covered in vomit.

02:07.373 --> 02:09.341
Yeah, which I could have handled
if you hadn't brainwashed me

02:09.375 --> 02:10.442
into thinking this place was evil.

02:10.476 --> 02:11.676
So, now I brainwashed you?

02:13.379 --> 02:15.313
You know what? That's fine.

02:15.348 --> 02:16.548
Whatever. I don't even care.

02:18.551 --> 02:20.752
See you around.

02:27.627 --> 02:28.593
It was awful.

02:28.628 --> 02:31.696
He completely lashed out at me,

02:31.731 --> 02:33.598
which I understand.

02:33.633 --> 02:37.369
But it was not fun to be
on the receiving end of.

02:37.380 --> 02:39.994
_

02:41.407 --> 02:43.575
After the week we've had,

02:43.609 --> 02:45.777
I really just wanna...

02:45.811 --> 02:48.346
stay under the radar for a little bit,

02:48.381 --> 02:50.782
put all the Tank and
Matthew stuff behind us.

02:52.685 --> 02:54.653
What?

02:57.770 --> 03:02.130
_

03:02.132 --> 03:04.329
Yeah, like, a thousand texts.

03:04.630 --> 03:06.764
_

03:08.465 --> 03:09.780
_

03:09.788 --> 03:11.536
What kind of picture?

03:14.640 --> 03:17.442
Oh, no, you didn't.

03:17.476 --> 03:19.444
You were sexting Matthew?

03:19.745 --> 03:22.760
_

03:22.761 --> 03:24.027
_

03:24.028 --> 03:25.717
Oh, it was a tasteful junk shot.

03:25.751 --> 03:27.318
I...

03:27.353 --> 03:28.720
I never thought that I
was gonna have to learn

03:28.754 --> 03:30.655
the sign for "junk shot."

03:30.656 --> 03:33.335
_

03:33.336 --> 03:35.770
_

03:35.772 --> 03:37.595
I can not believe you did that!

03:37.596 --> 03:38.838
_

03:38.839 --> 03:43.119
_

03:43.520 --> 03:45.980
_

03:45.981 --> 03:47.811
_

03:47.812 --> 03:50.925
_

03:52.611 --> 03:57.348
Well, we're just gonna have
to get the picture back.

03:57.383 --> 03:59.684
And then Matthew won't have anything

03:59.719 --> 04:01.319
to hold over you anymore,

04:01.353 --> 04:04.389
you can tell Principal Rose the truth about

04:04.423 --> 04:06.291
what he did to you.

04:07.592 --> 04:08.388
_

04:09.109 --> 04:12.478
_

04:14.300 --> 04:15.567
I don't know, but...

04:17.369 --> 04:19.504
We will figure it out.

04:36.622 --> 04:39.557
Is that your alarm clock?

04:39.592 --> 04:42.494
No, it's breakfast.

04:42.528 --> 04:44.629
Welcome to living with Daphne.

04:46.365 --> 04:49.434
Mm, don't get too comfortable.

04:49.468 --> 04:52.370
The blender will probably
go off any minute.

04:52.404 --> 04:54.339
She doesn't know how loud it is,

04:54.373 --> 04:57.342
but it's a small price to
pay for a gourmet breakfast.

04:59.745 --> 05:01.579
- Come in. Come in.
- Hey.

05:02.615 --> 05:03.681
Breakfast in bed?

05:03.716 --> 05:06.417
Pancakes with a blackberry drizzle

05:06.452 --> 05:08.486
and fresh squeezed orange juice.

05:08.521 --> 05:10.388
- Mm.
- This... this looks...

05:10.422 --> 05:12.557
um, how do you say "amazing"?

05:13.726 --> 05:14.692
Amazing.

05:14.727 --> 05:17.428
But if it doesn't taste amazing,

05:17.463 --> 05:19.297
this is the sign for "awful."

05:21.634 --> 05:23.301
Hey, no wait. Where are you going?

05:23.335 --> 05:26.404
Uh, when you were little we
couldn't get you to leave.

05:26.438 --> 05:28.706
You would crawl and wedge
yourself in between us.

05:28.741 --> 05:30.508
And you insisted

05:30.543 --> 05:33.311
on bringing every stuffed animal...

05:33.345 --> 05:34.646
the pig, the kitty,

05:34.680 --> 05:36.514
oh, and this very ugly dog.

05:36.549 --> 05:38.550
Mr. Chompers.

05:38.584 --> 05:41.352
Yes. Oh.

05:41.387 --> 05:42.687
I have to get ready for work.

05:45.524 --> 05:47.492
Bye.

05:50.823 --> 05:53.825
I really wish she wasn't
working for that guy.

05:53.859 --> 05:55.827
Don't worry.

05:57.496 --> 05:58.630
How do you say...

05:59.732 --> 06:01.532
don't worry.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.568
I'll go with her and
I'll keep an eye on her.

06:04.603 --> 06:06.404
Thanks.

06:06.438 --> 06:07.739
That's my girl.

06:07.773 --> 06:09.507
Who's your girl?

06:09.541 --> 06:12.410
Your mother is going to be on the cover

06:12.444 --> 06:13.478
of "Parade" magazine.

06:13.512 --> 06:15.480
Mom, that's awesome.

06:15.514 --> 06:17.348
I'm hoping you're drawing
the line at "Maxim."

06:17.383 --> 06:18.349
Yes.

06:18.384 --> 06:20.351
Hey, I have an idea.

06:20.386 --> 06:22.654
So, since Angelo has officially moved in,

06:22.688 --> 06:25.423
I thought maybe we could do like
a little welcome thingie for him.

06:25.457 --> 06:28.326
It has been awhile since we have
broken out the chili cauldron.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.661
Yeah.

06:29.695 --> 06:30.695
We could do that.

06:30.729 --> 06:32.497
Just got to pick a night.

06:34.566 --> 06:35.767
Okay.

06:35.801 --> 06:37.769
I should get going. Thank you.

06:37.803 --> 06:39.337
You're welcome.

06:40.839 --> 06:42.473
Here.

06:46.845 --> 06:48.713
So, is everything...

06:48.747 --> 06:51.482
okay with you?

06:51.517 --> 06:53.484
Yeah.

07:00.392 --> 07:02.393
Okay, I'm just gonna
come right out with it.

07:03.495 --> 07:06.297
We know you took the morning-after pill.

07:07.599 --> 07:08.599
We're not mad.

07:08.634 --> 07:10.468
"We." You told dad?

07:10.502 --> 07:12.470
Uh, well, actually he told me.

07:12.504 --> 07:14.472
- How did he find out?
- It doesn't matter.

07:14.506 --> 07:16.441
Look, honey, we don't
want you to feel awkward

07:16.475 --> 07:19.644
or ashamed, but we're concerned.

07:21.647 --> 07:23.414
Honestly...

07:23.449 --> 07:25.683
I wish you weren't having sex.

07:25.718 --> 07:27.485
But since you are,

07:27.519 --> 07:29.787
you and Tank need to use condoms.

07:29.822 --> 07:31.456
- Mom.
- I keep a box

07:31.490 --> 07:33.324
in the bathroom downstairs here

07:33.359 --> 07:34.425
and I don't count.

07:34.460 --> 07:36.561
And if you need help getting the pill, I...

07:36.595 --> 07:38.396
Mom, Tank and I broke up.

07:38.430 --> 07:40.331
Oh.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.501
I'm so sorry.

07:43.535 --> 07:45.470
Gosh.

07:45.504 --> 07:47.372
How you doing?

07:47.406 --> 07:51.442
I feel really terrible
about the whole thing.

08:04.390 --> 08:06.324
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:06.358 --> 08:08.393
How's it going with the shower kits?

08:08.427 --> 08:09.394
Pretty good.

08:09.428 --> 08:10.661
Almost done.

08:10.696 --> 08:12.497
Wow, that was fast.

08:12.531 --> 08:14.499
Um...

08:14.533 --> 08:18.536
We don't give out mouthwash.

08:18.570 --> 08:20.304
I'm hoping I misread that.

08:20.339 --> 08:21.539
Did you say no mouthwash?

08:21.573 --> 08:23.341
Yeah, some of the patients,

08:23.375 --> 08:25.643
they drink it to get drunk.

08:25.677 --> 08:28.479
Right, 'cause of alcohol.

08:28.514 --> 08:31.749
That's why we keep the
bottles behind the desk.

08:33.385 --> 08:35.318
Well, hopefully it will be easier

08:35.354 --> 08:37.388
taking the bottles out
than it was putting them in.

08:37.423 --> 08:39.323
You want to know a secret
to do it in half the time?

08:40.392 --> 08:41.458
Make your boyfriend do half the work.

08:41.493 --> 08:43.361
You don't have to do that.

08:43.395 --> 08:44.529
Hey, the faster we get it done,

08:44.563 --> 08:46.397
the faster we can do something a...

08:46.432 --> 08:47.598
a little more fun.

08:47.633 --> 08:49.333
Agreed.

08:50.369 --> 08:51.436
Daphne.

08:51.470 --> 08:52.770
Can I speak with you?

08:56.575 --> 08:58.342
I have good news.

08:58.377 --> 08:59.777
I found some funding.

08:59.812 --> 09:01.479
So starting tomorrow,

09:01.513 --> 09:02.647
you are my new assistant.

09:02.681 --> 09:04.682
Thank you.

09:04.716 --> 09:05.683
Hey, you earned it.

09:05.717 --> 09:06.751
You've been a hard worker

09:06.785 --> 09:08.519
and extremely helpful to our patients.

09:08.554 --> 09:10.655
I won't let you down, I promise.

09:10.689 --> 09:13.491
Good, because you'll have
lot more responsibilities...

09:13.525 --> 09:15.493
scheduling, handling the inventory,

09:15.527 --> 09:17.361
overseeing the volunteers.

09:17.396 --> 09:19.630
Overseeing the volunteers?

09:19.665 --> 09:20.631
That's right.

09:20.666 --> 09:21.632
But some of them

09:21.667 --> 09:24.335
have a lot more experience than I do.

09:24.369 --> 09:25.570
Campbell, for instance.

09:25.604 --> 09:29.740
Is supervising Campbell
going to be a problem for you?

09:31.510 --> 09:33.644
No. Not at all.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.746
Okay.

09:43.201 --> 09:44.508
Looking good Kathryn.

09:45.275 --> 09:47.843
Yeah yeah. Flirt with us.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.178
Yes.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.280
Keep it playful. Yes.

09:51.315 --> 09:53.015
Whoo-hoo! Okay.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.918
Maybe you guys, like, bat a little bit.

09:55.953 --> 09:58.955
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
that's it. Batters up.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.089
Yes!

10:00.123 --> 10:02.258
All right, Kathryn, Kathryn, more attitude.

10:02.292 --> 10:04.227
Yeah, these guys want you...

10:04.261 --> 10:06.229
... they can't have you and you know it.

10:06.263 --> 10:07.997
Why don't you be the coach?

10:08.031 --> 10:10.032
You're about to send
them off to the showers.

10:11.368 --> 10:13.369
I don't know why you need male models

10:13.403 --> 10:16.138
to play baseball players when
you got the real deal right here.

10:17.307 --> 10:19.141
Ooh! I think we should get

10:19.176 --> 10:20.343
some with Kathryn holding the bat.

10:20.377 --> 10:21.344
- Okay.
- Yes?

10:23.213 --> 10:24.880
Swing for the fences.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.048
Okay.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.250
Sweetie, you should choke
up a little bit on the bat.

10:27.284 --> 10:31.254
I'm sorry, you're making
me a little nervous, honey.

10:31.288 --> 10:33.155
Uh, okay then.

10:33.190 --> 10:34.156
I tell you what, I'm gonna go hit

10:34.191 --> 10:36.325
the treadmill.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.994
All right guys,

10:38.028 --> 10:38.536
you know what, let's take a quick break.

10:38.540 --> 10:41.130
I need to make a few adjustments.

10:41.164 --> 10:43.299
Thanks, guys. How's it going?

10:43.333 --> 10:46.168
Oh, the magazine's gonna love it.

10:46.203 --> 10:48.104
But I did just get an email
from our legal department...

10:48.138 --> 10:49.939
... And they have signed off on everything

10:49.973 --> 10:54.243
except for the sports
reporter character Tara Mazar.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.946
Yeah.

10:56.980 --> 11:00.916
Apparently, there is a female
sports reporter named Sarah Lazar.

11:02.252 --> 11:05.955
She tried to sleep with John
when he was with the Royals.

11:05.989 --> 11:07.790
Really?

11:07.824 --> 11:10.793
And she wrote the competing
"Switched at Birth" book.

11:10.827 --> 11:11.894
Wow.

11:11.929 --> 11:13.362
Well, apparently she read
the excerpts we leaked

11:13.365 --> 11:15.962
and she's filing an injunction
to stop the book's publication.

11:15.963 --> 11:16.989
Can she do that?

11:17.104 --> 11:19.126
Well, she can try, but don't worry.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.778
Worst case, we push the
release date back a bit.

11:21.812 --> 11:24.414
All right, everybody, let's shoot.

11:24.448 --> 11:27.450
You let the legal department
worry about Sarah Lazar.

11:27.484 --> 11:29.452
You just go shoot me a great cover.

11:40.864 --> 11:43.733
So... what did Dr. J want?

11:43.767 --> 11:48.504
He wanted to tell me that he's
hiring me as his assistant.

11:48.539 --> 11:50.840
That's great!

11:50.874 --> 11:54.677
I didn't know there was a job opening.

11:54.712 --> 11:56.846
There wasn't, really.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.815
I was looking for a way to stay on

11:58.849 --> 12:01.384
after my hours were up,

12:01.418 --> 12:03.820
so I asked.

12:03.854 --> 12:06.522
And I think he sort of created

12:06.557 --> 12:09.459
a job for me.

12:11.729 --> 12:15.364
Here, let's get back to fixing these.

12:20.336 --> 12:22.472
This might be harder than I thought.

12:22.506 --> 12:26.676
It's not just deleting
the photos from his phone,

12:26.710 --> 12:30.413
what if Matthew has some
kind of online backup?

12:32.351 --> 12:36.980
_

12:39.115 --> 12:41.215
_

12:41.216 --> 12:43.420
_

12:43.694 --> 12:45.561
Matthew has P.E. fourth period...

12:45.596 --> 12:47.864
I pass him every day
on my way to history...

12:47.898 --> 12:51.814
and he never has his
messenger bag with him.

12:52.415 --> 12:54.456
_

12:54.471 --> 12:57.181
Hmm, great. I'll make sure to brush up

12:57.182 --> 12:58.775
on my safecracking skills in study hall.

12:58.776 --> 13:01.922
_

13:02.379 --> 13:04.680
You know the combination?

13:05.321 --> 13:06.470
_

13:06.471 --> 13:10.461
_

13:10.462 --> 13:14.437
_

13:14.658 --> 13:17.560
Okay, so you get the combination

13:17.594 --> 13:19.562
and Matthew goes off to P.E.

13:19.596 --> 13:21.464
We have 50 minutes

13:21.498 --> 13:24.600
to get his laptop and phone,

13:24.635 --> 13:26.636
delete the photo, and then get

13:26.670 --> 13:28.671
everything back to his locker

13:28.705 --> 13:31.607
before class is over.

13:32.608 --> 13:34.880
_

13:46.590 --> 13:48.491
Stand down, Agent Sorento.

13:48.525 --> 13:50.860
It's just Wes. And be nice.

13:50.894 --> 13:54.463
Hey, ready to go?

13:54.498 --> 13:56.465
Sure, let me just grab my swatch books.

13:57.568 --> 13:58.534
Where are you going?

13:58.569 --> 13:59.535
Wes and I have a walk-through

13:59.570 --> 14:00.570
of the redevelopment.

14:01.738 --> 14:04.340
- You're going to East Riverside?
- Don't worry about it.

14:04.374 --> 14:05.341
She'll be with me the whole time.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.475
Oh, hey.

14:06.510 --> 14:07.777
Before I forget.

14:07.811 --> 14:10.613
Here's the price list for the marble guys.

14:12.449 --> 14:13.516
Is that a gun?

14:15.419 --> 14:16.385
Yeah.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.421
Have you lost your mind?

14:18.455 --> 14:19.488
Is that thing loaded?

14:19.523 --> 14:20.723
What good would it be if it wasn't?

14:20.817 --> 14:22.752
You just said it was
nothing to worry about.

14:22.786 --> 14:25.521
Because I have a gun. Is
this a problem for you?

14:25.555 --> 14:27.423
Hell yeah, it's a problem for me.

14:27.457 --> 14:28.491
Well, have you ever fired one?

14:28.525 --> 14:29.625
- No.
- Well, there you have it.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.494
Why don't you come to the shooting range,

14:31.528 --> 14:33.629
- I'll show you how to protect yourself.
- Absolutely not.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.798
- I didn't invite you.
- You American cowboy.

14:35.832 --> 14:38.534
Damn right. I'll defend
myself if I have to.

14:38.568 --> 14:39.702
Stop it, both of you.

14:40.737 --> 14:42.638
I'll take care of this.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.841
We are trying to de-escalate
things in East Riverside.

14:45.876 --> 14:47.843
I don't think bringing a loaded gun

14:47.878 --> 14:49.679
says "we're here to make things better."

14:49.713 --> 14:51.747
No, it says, "we will not be threatened."

14:53.550 --> 14:55.551
I'll go with you to East Riverside,

14:55.585 --> 14:56.886
but that thing stays in the trunk.

14:57.955 --> 15:01.490
Fine. If we run into any trouble,

15:01.525 --> 15:04.694
we can fend them off with our
intimidating wallpaper sales.

15:16.807 --> 15:17.873
She's not here.

15:21.678 --> 15:23.479
I guess you heard we broke up?

15:23.513 --> 15:25.881
Yeah, sorry to hear about that.

15:25.916 --> 15:28.551
I just...

15:28.585 --> 15:31.520
I need to talk to her.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.723
I just don't understand
why she would end things

15:33.757 --> 15:34.824
so suddenly.

15:34.858 --> 15:38.461
There's gotta be something I'm missing.

15:40.630 --> 15:42.798
Do you know something?

15:42.833 --> 15:45.534
I know about Bay having to get

15:45.569 --> 15:46.836
emergency contraception.

15:49.539 --> 15:50.639
Mr. Kennish, I swear...

15:50.674 --> 15:52.808
Please don't play dumb with me.

15:52.843 --> 15:55.678
I saw her computer.

15:55.712 --> 15:57.546
She was looking up places to buy

15:57.581 --> 15:58.681
the morning-after pill.

15:58.715 --> 16:03.586
I don't know if that's the
reason that you broke up,

16:03.620 --> 16:05.554
but I do know I do not want her

16:05.589 --> 16:08.791
with someone who would
put her in that position.

16:08.825 --> 16:11.761
You know, honestly,

16:11.795 --> 16:14.697
I expected more from you.

16:16.867 --> 16:20.569
Well, I can promise you
it'll never happen again.

16:46.046 --> 16:46.646
Sarah.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.019
You're stalking me at my place of work?

16:52.053 --> 16:54.054
Why are you trying to sabotage my career?

16:54.089 --> 16:55.956
Me? Sabotage you?

16:57.959 --> 16:58.993
You know...

16:59.027 --> 17:00.995
my entire career, editors assume

17:01.029 --> 17:02.263
that I slept with players to get a story.

17:02.297 --> 17:04.265
And finally,

17:04.299 --> 17:05.933
I work hard enough and long enough

17:05.967 --> 17:06.967
for them to stop saying that.

17:07.002 --> 17:08.969
And now you and your book...

17:09.003 --> 17:11.038
It's a fictional character.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.873
Right, Kathryn.

17:12.907 --> 17:15.242
So, "Tara Mazar" just
came to you in a dream.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.311
You know,

17:18.346 --> 17:20.314
I don't know what your
obsession is with me.

17:20.348 --> 17:24.218
You're the one who wrote
a book about my life.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.954
And the second you found out

17:26.988 --> 17:28.255
I was writing a book about my family,

17:28.290 --> 17:29.290
you should have dropped yours.

17:29.324 --> 17:31.058
I had already started it

17:31.092 --> 17:33.260
and I had a good take on it.

17:33.295 --> 17:34.995
And every word I wrote was the truth.

17:35.030 --> 17:37.131
You wrote about my miscarriage.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.167
It was relevant to the story.

17:40.201 --> 17:41.268
Oh.

17:41.303 --> 17:43.871
And I was trying to make you seem...

17:43.905 --> 17:46.006
sympathetic.

17:46.041 --> 17:47.207
I didn't make up lies about you

17:47.242 --> 17:49.310
and I will be damned if I sit back

17:49.344 --> 17:51.245
while you make them up about me.

17:53.014 --> 17:54.114
Fine.

17:54.149 --> 17:55.316
More publicity for my book.

18:04.926 --> 18:06.060
Shouldn't you be at school?

18:06.094 --> 18:07.928
I don't have a first period.

18:07.963 --> 18:10.030
Uh, someone from the state medical board

18:10.065 --> 18:11.231
is coming by for an inspection

18:11.266 --> 18:12.266
and I wanted to be here.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.267
Okay.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.268
We don't have a lot of time.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.269
Everyone else is busy,

18:15.303 --> 18:17.071
and there is a really long list

18:17.105 --> 18:18.105
of things to take care of,

18:18.139 --> 18:19.273
stuff like soap dispensers

18:19.307 --> 18:21.275
have to be within eight inches of the sink,

18:21.309 --> 18:23.243
and that's not even the craziest one.

18:23.278 --> 18:25.079
It's gonna take us hours to bring

18:25.113 --> 18:27.214
- the supply closet up to code.
- Just relax.

18:27.248 --> 18:30.150
I'll relax after we pass the inspection.

18:30.185 --> 18:31.885
I've divided up the check list.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.024
We don't need to bother with half this.

18:37.058 --> 18:38.258
What do you mean?

18:38.293 --> 18:40.961
I mean, the only thing they really check

18:40.996 --> 18:42.997
is the drug lock-up,

18:43.031 --> 18:45.032
rubber glove usage

18:45.066 --> 18:46.233
and medical waste disposal.

18:46.267 --> 18:47.935
How do you know that?

18:47.969 --> 18:50.871
I've been through a few
of these inspections.

18:50.905 --> 18:52.873
Well, just 'cause they
didn't check last time

18:52.907 --> 18:54.308
doesn't mean they won't check this time.

18:54.342 --> 18:57.144
Trust me. Just focus

18:57.178 --> 18:58.879
on the really important things.

18:58.913 --> 19:01.915
This is the first assignment
Dr. J has given me.

19:01.950 --> 19:03.017
We're gonna do this right.

19:04.319 --> 19:06.020
Okay.

19:16.524 --> 19:17.734
_

19:35.050 --> 19:36.316
Jackpot.

19:46.308 --> 19:47.328
_

19:47.335 --> 19:48.195
What about that one?

19:49.740 --> 19:52.382
_

19:52.383 --> 19:54.120
_

19:55.270 --> 19:59.239
Okay. 20 minutes to wipe the computer

19:59.274 --> 20:01.909
and then get everything back to his locker.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.051
What?

20:12.352 --> 20:15.052
_

20:15.063 --> 20:17.257
You don't want me to see it.

20:48.323 --> 20:51.125
Hey, what is it?

20:57.365 --> 20:59.933
Oh my God.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.869
Where did he get all of these?

21:02.470 --> 21:06.180
_

21:07.781 --> 21:10.074
_

21:20.120 --> 21:22.810
_

21:24.090 --> 21:27.311
_

21:28.900 --> 21:33.177
_

21:37.180 --> 21:41.535
_

21:44.836 --> 21:45.873
_

21:49.217 --> 21:52.386
I think... he's in love with you.

22:02.987 --> 22:05.228
_

22:05.229 --> 22:07.060
_

22:07.408 --> 22:11.077
Think about all the
time he put into writing

22:11.111 --> 22:12.078
all those texts.

22:12.112 --> 22:14.547
How long he let it go on for.

22:14.581 --> 22:18.151
He thought you two had a real connection.

22:18.152 --> 22:20.186
_

22:21.488 --> 22:23.156
Not to him.

22:23.157 --> 22:24.591
_

22:24.592 --> 22:28.937
_

22:30.431 --> 22:34.400
Well, he must have changed his mind.

22:41.151 --> 22:44.343
_

22:44.344 --> 22:47.672
_

22:48.449 --> 22:50.183
What did you say?

22:51.294 --> 22:53.872
_

22:56.323 --> 22:57.423
That would do it.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.295
Oh, I've got to get this stuff back

23:02.329 --> 23:03.463
to his locker now.

23:12.130 --> 23:14.390
_

23:18.195 --> 23:19.996
We deleted the photo.

23:20.030 --> 23:21.030
It's gone.

23:23.831 --> 23:25.903
_

23:28.954 --> 23:33.014
_

23:33.344 --> 23:37.046
Us? Expelled? Matthew, just stop.

23:40.017 --> 23:41.985
We know what this is about.

23:42.986 --> 23:43.786
_

23:44.922 --> 23:46.990
We read your letter.

23:49.801 --> 23:50.974
_

23:51.195 --> 23:53.329
Matthew, come on.

23:53.364 --> 23:55.398
The letter you wrote to Emmett.

24:00.190 --> 24:04.041
_

24:23.314 --> 24:25.315
Is everything okay?

24:25.349 --> 24:27.083
No.

24:27.117 --> 24:30.153
The inspector found a
sharps waist container

24:30.187 --> 24:33.189
- mixed in with the regular trash.
- Crap.

24:34.959 --> 24:36.192
Waste removal was on your list.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.226
But I checked it.

24:37.261 --> 24:38.895
Clearly, not very well.

24:38.929 --> 24:42.332
Maybe I would have caught
it if I wasn't racing around

24:42.366 --> 24:44.334
measuring soap dispensers.

24:46.203 --> 24:49.172
I covered for you, so
Dr. J thinks I screwed up.

24:49.206 --> 24:51.107
I told you to focus on three things.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.910
- The drug lockup...
- I was doing my job.

24:53.944 --> 24:56.279
- I made a decision.
- Yes, you did.

24:58.282 --> 25:00.817
So that's what this is about?

25:00.851 --> 25:03.186
You think I shouldn't have gotten this job?

25:03.220 --> 25:07.156
It should have been somebody that knows

25:07.191 --> 25:09.959
- how this place runs.
- Like you.

25:09.994 --> 25:12.095
Why didn't you tell me you were gonna

25:12.129 --> 25:14.263
- ask him for a job?
- I don't know.

25:14.298 --> 25:16.132
Don't you find it a little cagey

25:16.166 --> 25:17.300
going behind my back like that?

25:17.334 --> 25:19.002
I wasn't trying to go behind your back.

25:19.036 --> 25:20.837
Don't you think I'd like a paying job?

25:20.871 --> 25:23.036
Of course. I assumed that you never asked.

25:23.060 --> 25:24.994
Suddenly you ask,

25:25.029 --> 25:26.763
and money falls from the sky.

25:26.797 --> 25:28.765
I have no idea where he got the funding.

25:28.799 --> 25:29.966
I just find it a little weird.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.834
Well, maybe you should be
asking him why you didn't

25:31.869 --> 25:33.202
get the job and not me.

25:33.237 --> 25:34.871
You know what, you're right.

25:43.013 --> 25:43.980
Hey.

25:44.014 --> 25:44.981
Can I talk to you?

25:44.982 --> 25:46.142
_

25:46.150 --> 25:47.784
Okay.

25:47.818 --> 25:48.985
Well, uh,

25:49.019 --> 25:50.219
I have this friend

25:50.254 --> 25:52.822
and he did this terrible thing

25:52.856 --> 25:55.758
to another friend, but then I found out

25:55.793 --> 25:58.761
that the first friend has feelings for

25:58.796 --> 25:59.796
the second friend and...

25:59.797 --> 26:02.930
_

26:03.968 --> 26:04.934
You know?

26:06.935 --> 26:08.090
_

26:08.872 --> 26:11.774
Did you know how he felt

26:11.809 --> 26:12.875
about Emmett?

26:12.876 --> 26:14.910
_

26:14.911 --> 26:18.194
_

26:18.195 --> 26:20.420
_

26:20.421 --> 26:22.539
_

26:22.540 --> 26:27.007
_

26:28.508 --> 26:30.073
_

26:30.074 --> 26:33.170
_

26:33.998 --> 26:35.865
I don't know what to do.

26:35.899 --> 26:38.801
I mean, he did this awful thing to Emmett.

26:38.836 --> 26:40.069
And we could report him,

26:40.104 --> 26:41.871
we should report him,

26:41.905 --> 26:44.173
but then all this other
stuff would come out.

26:44.174 --> 26:46.670
_

26:46.810 --> 26:47.697
But?

26:47.698 --> 26:50.979
_

26:50.980 --> 26:54.528
_

26:54.529 --> 26:57.070
_

26:57.071 --> 26:58.855
There's, like, five guys

26:58.889 --> 26:59.956
who are out at Carlton.

27:01.157 --> 27:04.138
_

27:04.139 --> 27:06.143
_

27:07.516 --> 27:10.911
_

27:11.612 --> 27:14.822
_

27:14.823 --> 27:17.436
_

27:23.213 --> 27:24.814
Hey.

27:24.848 --> 27:26.149
Am I too late for the man candy?

27:26.183 --> 27:27.850
A day late.

27:29.119 --> 27:31.821
I got hit by another Sarah Lazar bomb.

27:31.855 --> 27:33.089
Oh, no. Not her again.

27:33.123 --> 27:35.925
Yeah, she's suing to keep
my book from coming out.

27:35.959 --> 27:37.193
On what grounds?

27:37.227 --> 27:40.797
Well, I have this character
that's a sports writer

27:40.831 --> 27:44.767
who sleeps around to get stories.

27:44.802 --> 27:46.202
Is it based on her?

27:46.236 --> 27:50.073
Yes, but I didn't start those rumors.

27:51.108 --> 27:53.042
But you are repeating them.

27:53.077 --> 27:55.812
I thought you'd be on my side.

27:55.846 --> 27:58.748
I want to be, but as a woman

27:58.782 --> 28:01.851
who is being smeared with
rumors of sleeping with her boss,

28:01.885 --> 28:03.820
I see Sarah's point.

28:03.854 --> 28:06.856
Who's saying that about you?

28:06.890 --> 28:09.759
My cousin Felicia, for one.

28:09.793 --> 28:11.127
The one who's house you redecorated?

28:11.161 --> 28:13.930
- For free.
- Unbelievable.

28:13.964 --> 28:15.932
You want to knock down a successful woman,

28:15.966 --> 28:16.933
call her a slut.

28:17.968 --> 28:19.202
I got to take this.

28:19.236 --> 28:21.804
Hey, Wes, what's up?

28:21.839 --> 28:23.039
Yeah.

28:23.073 --> 28:25.908
Of course I remembered to
order the carpet samples.

28:25.943 --> 28:27.210
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

28:27.244 --> 28:28.778
Bye.

28:28.812 --> 28:30.913
You forgot to order the carpet samples.

28:32.249 --> 28:34.884
No, um, I stopped off at the store

28:34.918 --> 28:36.819
to pick up something for dessert.

28:36.854 --> 28:38.754
Should I get strawberry ice cream

28:38.789 --> 28:39.889
or mint chocolate chip?

28:39.923 --> 28:42.125
Okay.

28:42.159 --> 28:43.793
I'll surprise you.

28:43.827 --> 28:45.962
I'll be home in a bit. Bye.

29:29.106 --> 29:31.073
911, what's your emergency?

29:31.108 --> 29:34.110
Um, I think I'm being followed.
There's a man sitting in a car

29:34.144 --> 29:36.913
in the parking lot where I work.
I think he's waiting for me.

29:36.947 --> 29:39.849
- What's your location?
- 8510 Hopkins Avenue.

29:39.883 --> 29:42.785
I'm sending a patrol car now.
Can you give me a description

29:42.819 --> 29:44.153
- of the person in the vehicle?
- Okay.

29:46.890 --> 29:48.824
Ma'am?

29:48.859 --> 29:50.126
Are you there?

29:50.160 --> 29:51.194
Yeah.

29:51.228 --> 29:53.196
Um, it looks like he's gone now.

29:53.230 --> 29:55.031
Are you sure?

29:55.065 --> 29:56.799
I can still send a patrol car.

29:56.833 --> 29:58.134
Uh, no.

29:58.168 --> 30:00.036
It's okay.

30:00.070 --> 30:02.171
I think I'm just being paranoid.

30:02.206 --> 30:04.173
Thanks.

30:07.244 --> 30:08.978
Oh God.

30:19.923 --> 30:21.157
Tank.

30:21.191 --> 30:23.192
Hey, I missed you in class.

30:23.227 --> 30:25.027
Yeah, I didn't really feel like going.

30:25.095 --> 30:27.029
Tank.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.168
We're gonna have to see
each other in our class.

30:32.202 --> 30:33.970
And I don't want things

30:34.004 --> 30:35.137
to be weird between us.

30:35.172 --> 30:37.840
I know this might not be easy, but

30:37.874 --> 30:40.142
I really want us to be friends again.

30:40.177 --> 30:43.879
You know, I stopped by your house

30:43.914 --> 30:46.115
with some stupid fantasy
of winning you back.

30:46.149 --> 30:48.818
I ran into your dad instead.

30:48.852 --> 30:51.020
I got a lecture about
having unprotected sex

30:51.054 --> 30:53.256
and forcing his daughter to
get the morning-after pill.

30:53.290 --> 30:55.925
Oh God.

30:55.959 --> 30:57.760
Not sure who that little
talk was meant for,

30:57.794 --> 30:59.829
but it sure as hell wasn't me.

30:59.863 --> 31:01.897
And you might want to clear
your browser history next time.

31:01.932 --> 31:03.199
- Tank.
- Just so I know,

31:03.233 --> 31:04.233
was it the army guy

31:04.268 --> 31:06.168
who lied about cheating on you?

31:06.203 --> 31:08.904
Or was it Emmett? Who actually did.

31:20.050 --> 31:22.051
I am such an idiot.

31:22.085 --> 31:24.920
I pretty much helped you two
get back together, didn't I?

31:24.955 --> 31:27.089
You have every right to be mad at me,

31:27.124 --> 31:29.992
and I'm sorry that I lied to you, but...

31:31.995 --> 31:33.229
I just thought that the truth

31:33.263 --> 31:35.031
was gonna hurt you even more.

31:35.065 --> 31:39.035
After you found out that
Emmett cheated on you,

31:39.069 --> 31:42.138
was there anything he could
say to make you feel better?

31:45.075 --> 31:46.042
No.

31:48.245 --> 31:51.213
Well, there you go.

32:08.125 --> 32:10.793
Sorry, I didn't know it was on.

32:10.828 --> 32:13.062
No, perfect timing.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.732
I added flashing lights to the system.

32:15.766 --> 32:17.800
I was just about to test it.

32:17.835 --> 32:18.968
Looks like it works.

32:19.003 --> 32:19.969
Yeah.

32:21.905 --> 32:24.007
Is my mom here?

32:24.041 --> 32:27.710
Um, she went to the, um...

32:30.881 --> 32:32.849
store.

32:36.186 --> 32:38.988
Is there anything I can do?

32:39.023 --> 32:42.759
I just had a really
big fight with Campbell.

32:42.793 --> 32:45.828
I thought things were going well.

32:45.863 --> 32:47.797
They were...

32:47.831 --> 32:50.133
until Dr. J promoted me and not him.

32:51.201 --> 32:54.704
But the thing is,

32:54.738 --> 32:57.674
he's been there a lot longer than me.

32:57.741 --> 33:00.743
The doctor hired you, not him.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.078
There must have been a reason for that.

33:02.112 --> 33:04.047
Yeah, I guess.

33:04.081 --> 33:06.816
I'm not, like, embarrassed about

33:06.850 --> 33:08.785
being smart or anything.

33:08.852 --> 33:10.853
It's just, being my boyfriend's boss,

33:10.888 --> 33:11.921
is that gonna work?

33:11.955 --> 33:13.923
Maybe not.

33:13.957 --> 33:15.725
But then you're gonna have to decide

33:15.759 --> 33:17.994
- which is more important.
- Can't I have both?

33:19.029 --> 33:20.163
Depends on the guy.

33:21.765 --> 33:23.766
Oh, um, so

33:23.801 --> 33:24.867
did you decide on which ice cream?

33:24.902 --> 33:26.803
Oh.

33:26.837 --> 33:27.804
Neither.

33:27.838 --> 33:29.038
By the time I got to the checkout,

33:29.073 --> 33:32.041
the place was a madhouse, so I left.

33:32.076 --> 33:34.177
Sorry.

33:38.082 --> 33:39.782
Yikes.

33:39.817 --> 33:41.851
Oh, you look amazing.

33:41.885 --> 33:44.754
You know, I had some ideas about

33:44.788 --> 33:46.122
the Tara Mazar character.

33:46.156 --> 33:48.791
She's starting to feel a
little... I don't know...

33:48.826 --> 33:50.993
one-dimensional. I think
we're missing an opportunity

33:51.028 --> 33:52.829
to make her more human.

33:52.863 --> 33:54.130
But she's the villain.

33:54.164 --> 33:56.866
I know, but I think we could make her,

33:56.900 --> 33:58.735
you know, more well-rounded.

33:58.769 --> 34:00.703
Rely less on the bedroom antics.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.705
And if we change the character's name,

34:02.740 --> 34:04.707
we could avoid a lawsuit, too.

34:04.742 --> 34:06.843
Oh, I'm not worried about that lawsuit.

34:06.877 --> 34:08.043
Do you know what makes people

34:08.112 --> 34:09.145
really want to read a book?

34:09.179 --> 34:11.914
When other people tell them they can't.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.817
Yeah, I know.

34:14.851 --> 34:16.085
I think it's really more about

34:16.120 --> 34:19.121
not wanting Tara Mazar to be a cliché.

34:19.156 --> 34:22.058
Well, I love the character as written.

34:22.092 --> 34:24.761
Well, I'd like to try another version.

34:24.795 --> 34:27.130
Nope. Don't change a word.

34:27.164 --> 34:30.166
You know, I got to get to the airport.

34:30.199 --> 34:31.801
Pick your top three,

34:31.835 --> 34:33.002
and we'll talk tomorrow.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.004
They look great.

34:46.049 --> 34:47.116
Hi.

34:49.085 --> 34:51.187
Hi.

34:51.221 --> 34:53.089
You okay?

35:00.931 --> 35:03.833
Tank's not the reason that I took

35:03.867 --> 35:04.967
the morning-after pill.

35:07.871 --> 35:09.872
It was Emmett.

35:10.941 --> 35:14.911
I thought you were dating Tank.

35:18.081 --> 35:20.817
So you and Emmett...

35:23.020 --> 35:24.787
Yeah.

35:27.758 --> 35:29.926
I guess I went off on the wrong guy.

35:31.895 --> 35:34.831
Yeah, Tank's not the bad guy here.

35:34.865 --> 35:36.699
I am.

35:36.733 --> 35:38.768
No.

35:38.802 --> 35:40.903
You're not a bad person.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.042
You just made a bad choice.

35:51.915 --> 35:55.117
I don't think Tank's ever
going to be able to forgive me.

35:58.822 --> 36:01.657
I totally broke his heart,

36:01.692 --> 36:04.060
he is this great guy

36:04.094 --> 36:08.097
and I really do care about him but...

36:12.736 --> 36:14.871
I love Emmett.

36:14.905 --> 36:18.875
Sometimes love makes you do stupid things.

36:25.949 --> 36:27.683
Hey, um,

36:27.718 --> 36:29.118
I want to get the rest of
these installed tonight, okay?

36:29.152 --> 36:31.120
Okay.

36:32.189 --> 36:33.923
It's nice having him around.

36:33.957 --> 36:35.691
Yeah.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.693
Oh.

36:46.069 --> 36:47.036
Hello.

36:47.070 --> 36:48.738
Regina Vasquez?

36:48.772 --> 36:50.072
Speaking.

36:51.742 --> 36:52.875
Hello?

36:53.877 --> 36:55.845
Hello?

36:59.149 --> 37:00.816
Who was that?

37:00.851 --> 37:03.119
- Wrong number.
- Mom.

37:03.153 --> 37:05.121
Seriously, wrong number.

37:17.452 --> 37:21.088
Hey, Jess, where's the geological study?

37:21.123 --> 37:24.425
I can't find it in any of these.

37:24.459 --> 37:25.426
Oh.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.495
You're early.

37:27.529 --> 37:30.064
We're not meeting the
engineers for a couple of hours.

37:30.098 --> 37:32.266
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

37:32.301 --> 37:35.202
Okay.

37:35.237 --> 37:36.237
So...

37:36.271 --> 37:40.074
You had to get a permit to carry your gun?

37:40.108 --> 37:42.476
Yep.

37:42.511 --> 37:45.146
And did you take

37:45.180 --> 37:46.347
a class to learn how to sh...

37:46.381 --> 37:47.348
Yes.

37:47.382 --> 37:49.033
I know all about gun safety.

37:49.037 --> 37:51.439
And all of my guns have
trigger locks on them.

37:51.473 --> 37:53.007
Why?

37:53.041 --> 37:56.110
I would like to take you up on your offer.

37:57.179 --> 37:59.981
I want you to teach me how to shoot.

38:08.932 --> 38:09.554
_

38:11.426 --> 38:14.061
I want to talk to you...

38:14.096 --> 38:16.063
about Matthew.

38:17.004 --> 38:18.318
_

38:21.370 --> 38:25.940
I think you should just
let the whole thing go.

38:25.941 --> 38:27.008
_

38:27.009 --> 38:29.048
_

38:29.311 --> 38:31.979
Turning him in isn't gonna change anything.

38:32.014 --> 38:34.081
It would only humiliate him.

38:34.082 --> 38:36.101
_

38:36.418 --> 38:38.185
I know.

38:38.220 --> 38:41.322
Emmett, I don't think he's
come out to anyone yet.

38:41.356 --> 38:44.959
And I just feel like if we don't...

38:46.261 --> 38:50.064
If you don't handle this just right...

38:51.300 --> 38:53.367
