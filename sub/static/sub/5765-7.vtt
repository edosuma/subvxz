WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:10.337
BREE:
It's nothing.

00:10.370 --> 00:12.133
What do you mean,
it's nothing?

00:12.180 --> 00:14.307
Look at 'em.

00:14.340 --> 00:15.307
BREE:
I am looking at them.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.272
It's a financial
meeting.

00:16.310 --> 00:18.346
That's how they look
in a financial meeting.

00:18.380 --> 00:21.042
No, that's how they look
when they're cutting jobs.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.047
Come on,

00:22.090 --> 00:23.045
law firms aren't recession-proof

00:23.090 --> 00:24.284
the way they used to be.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.515
Would you stop
scaring yourself?

00:26.560 --> 00:28.812
They said billable hours
are up this year.

00:28.860 --> 00:32.125
They said
we're fine.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.252
And tax
Hﬁgaﬁon?

00:33.300 --> 00:34.289
We have six
full-time.

00:34.330 --> 00:38.767
All right, let's cut four
and hold on to two.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.234
Which four?

00:41.270 --> 00:42.430
Bayer?

00:43.470 --> 00:45.301
His wife is pregnant.

00:45.340 --> 00:46.307
He doesn't have seniority.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.570
See if he'll do part-time.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.316
DIANE:
And the junior associates?

00:57.850 --> 00:59.351
Let's put
a pin in that.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.187
We don't have
many pins left.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.357
Diane.

01:05.130 --> 01:07.291
Oh, better late
than never.

01:07.330 --> 01:08.524
What, Stern?

01:08.560 --> 01:11.267
The great man
makes an appearance.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.267
Jonas, how are you?

01:12.300 --> 01:13.289
We need to run
some names by you

01:13.340 --> 01:15.228
for layoffs.

01:15.270 --> 01:16.237
Where are you?

01:16.270 --> 01:17.806
It sounds loud.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.577
Alicia, do you have a second?

01:25.610 --> 01:26.816
Sure.

01:28.450 --> 01:30.611
WILL:
It's not like law school,
is it?

01:30.650 --> 01:32.288
It's better.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.379
I always felt unsure
in law school.

01:34.420 --> 01:35.648
Really?

01:35.690 --> 01:36.759
Could have fooled me.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.929
I did fool you.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.893
So I have a favor
to ask you.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.261
You never met Mr. Stern.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.790
No, he's been away.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.263
Right, Bali and
the Barrier Reef.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.336
Anyway, he has a daughter--
Anna-- from his first marriage.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.529
She's being sued.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.400
I don't know all the details,
but I'm sure they're ugly.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.805
Last time, we got her
out of a drug possession.

01:58.850 --> 02:00.249
The time before that,
she drove a car

02:00.280 --> 02:01.713
through
a department store window.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.217
You don't need to
take notes on this.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.649
Anna's a_real
party girl.

02:04.690 --> 02:07.488
Her new husband hired
some no-name lavwer,

02:07.520 --> 02:10.648
and Mr_. Stern wants someonefrom
our firm to cocounsel WIth him.

02:10.690 --> 02:11.782
With this other lawyer?
Yeah.

02:11.830 --> 02:13.297
Just make sure he
doesn't screw up.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.297
Second chair him.

02:14.330 --> 02:15.297
She's meeting
with the lavwer in two hours,

02:15.330 --> 02:17.366
so take Kalinda and get
a lay of the land, okay?

02:18.970 --> 02:21.291
Alicia.

02:21.340 --> 02:24.537
We're going through a lot
of changes around here.

02:24.570 --> 02:27.209
There's only three votes
that really matter--

02:27.240 --> 02:30.607
mine, Diane's, and Mr. Stern's.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.175
This is a good way
to impress Mr. Stern.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.484
Thanks.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.227
BOY:
Whoa, you're not kidding.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.454
ZACH:
Yeah, they were
just on our doorstep.

02:43.490 --> 02:44.957
Someone rang the doorbell
and ran.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.925
BOY:
Why?
I don't know,
I think to scare my mom.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.520
Is that...
what, crack?

02:50.570 --> 02:52.367
Yeah, but it's
Photoshopped.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.890
My dad's not even
in the picture.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.807
Why do all the cool
things happen to you?

02:56.840 --> 02:58.728
That's not the hooker
from the sex tape?

02:58.770 --> 03:00.328
No, it's somebody else.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.506
Look, if I
could find her,

03:01.540 --> 03:05.271
I could figure out who took
the pictures and who did this.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.579
Here.

03:08.620 --> 03:12.818
What's the password for
the parental controls?

03:12.860 --> 03:15.852
I don't have
parental controls.

03:15.890 --> 03:17.289
My mom trusts me.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.422
You're kidding.

03:18.460 --> 03:19.859
This is so great.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.528
What are you doing?

03:22.570 --> 03:24.492
39,000 matches.

03:24.530 --> 03:25.827
That's crazy.

03:25.870 --> 03:27.337
That's a start.

03:27.370 --> 03:29.736
WOMAN (over speaker):
You must be 18 years or older
to access Sweet...

03:29.770 --> 03:32.409
Aren't you glad
you have a friend

03:32.440 --> 03:35.773
like me to help you with
a tough chore like this?

03:40.420 --> 03:42.240
No.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.382
No.

03:43.420 --> 03:44.842
Hot but no.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.414
Next site.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.586
This is going
to take forever.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.609
Yeah.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.754
Damn, maybe you should go do
your algebra homework

03:51.790 --> 03:52.996
or something.

04:06.410 --> 04:08.378
Stern's daughter lives here?

04:08.410 --> 04:10.275
Maybe we have
the wrong address.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.579
Or maybe there's a
methadone clinic near here.

04:14.620 --> 04:15.678
WOMAN:
Excuse me.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.938
Are you looking
for me?

04:17.990 --> 04:20.879
Actually, we're...

04:22.530 --> 04:23.758
Are you...?

04:23.790 --> 04:25.553
I'm Anna, Jonas
Stern's daughter.

04:25.590 --> 04:28.320
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:28.360 --> 04:29.998
Don't worry, I
get that a lot.

04:30.030 --> 04:31.520
This is me now.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.037
Hi.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.891
Hi.

04:35.940 --> 04:36.929
ANNA:
I was in rehab

04:36.970 --> 04:38.665
out in Westchester,

04:38.710 --> 04:40.769
and there was
this volunteer there,

04:40.810 --> 04:43.938
a yeshiva student,
and he had

04:43.980 --> 04:46.869
this amazing LP collection.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.444
And so you went Orthodox?

04:49.550 --> 04:50.812
Hey, they were good LPs.

04:50.850 --> 04:52.351
No, Isaac

04:52.390 --> 04:56.986
was talking about passion
and music and the Torah,

04:57.030 --> 05:01.399
and Ijust... I fell in love.

05:01.430 --> 05:02.920
That's the problem
with love--

05:02.970 --> 05:04.528
you can't make it do

05:04.570 --> 05:05.969
what you want.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.638
So...

05:07.670 --> 05:08.568
what happened?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.761
Well, a lady tripped
in front of our house

05:10.810 --> 05:12.505
and she's suing us.

05:12.540 --> 05:15.600
We have homeowner's insurance,
but it only covers the $20,000

05:15.640 --> 05:18.803
in compensatory damages,
not the punitive.

05:18.850 --> 05:20.511
How much is
the punitive?

05:20.550 --> 05:23.018
$1.2 million.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.881
She's suing you
for $1.2 million?

05:24.920 --> 05:26.353
Yes.

05:26.390 --> 05:29.484
It'll take everything
we own and our future.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.521
Just when you think you
find your place in life,

05:31.560 --> 05:33.425
here comes this.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.793
Sorry, I can't do this
during the Sabbath.

05:36.830 --> 05:39.094
It's work.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.495
And what about your dad--

05:40.540 --> 05:43.566
can he help?
MAN:
We don't want it.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.871
We're not in touch with him.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.644
Wow.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.840
Yeah.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.110
Last year she was club-hopping
with Tara Reid.

05:56.150 --> 05:57.811
You know what she'll be doing
next year?

05:57.850 --> 05:59.954
Club-hopping with Tara Reid.

05:59.990 --> 06:00.957
Does anyone

06:00.990 --> 06:02.116
ever surprise you?

06:02.160 --> 06:03.457
No.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.026
Even me?

06:05.060 --> 06:06.459
Especially you.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.855
(both chuckle)

06:08.900 --> 06:11.824
Sorry, Anna probably told you,
we've already hired a lawyer.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.758
He did work for my
brother on a foreclosure,

06:13.800 --> 06:14.767
and he's very good,

06:14.800 --> 06:16.529
but, um, thank you.

06:16.570 --> 06:17.730
Isaac,

06:17.770 --> 06:19.704
could you just tell us
what happened?

06:19.740 --> 06:21.537
Are you Jewish?

06:21.580 --> 06:23.502
Is that important?

06:23.550 --> 06:24.608
To understand what
happened, yes.

06:24.650 --> 06:27.414
It's important to be
Jewish to understand

06:27.450 --> 06:28.644
a slip and fall?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.887
This slip
and fall, yes.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.717
I'm sorry you came
all this way, Mrs....?

06:32.760 --> 06:33.749
Florrick.

06:34.790 --> 06:36.985
Yo
ul
re.. ?

06:38.630 --> 06:41.656
Your husband was a great
man, Mrs. Florrick.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.626
A very great man.

06:44.670 --> 06:45.898
The hate crimes on 58th--

06:45.930 --> 06:47.431
he put the skinheads away.

06:47.470 --> 06:48.869
He took us seriously.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.504
How's he doing?

06:52.540 --> 06:55.429
He's... in prison.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.708
Yes, I'm sorry.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.571
A righteous man quickly finds
the world aligned against him.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.713
Thank you, Isaac.

07:06.190 --> 07:08.852
ISAAC: _
It's an eruv Wire.

07:08.890 --> 07:09.925
A what?

07:09.960 --> 07:12.224
An eruv wire.

07:12.260 --> 07:15.650
Well, you know the Sabbath
is a holy day of rest.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.190
An exception is
made for minor work

07:17.230 --> 07:20.097
like carrying a
baby or groceries

07:20.140 --> 07:21.698
in a community's
courtyard.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.935
But there are no courtyards
these days

07:23.970 --> 07:27.178
so the eruv wire creates
a symbolic courtyard

07:27.210 --> 07:29.770
for the whole
neighborhood.

07:30.810 --> 07:33.040
And this eruv wire fell?

07:33.080 --> 07:34.638
Yes, from there.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.716
Isn't it the responsibility

07:36.750 --> 07:38.615
of the community?
No,

07:38.650 --> 07:39.958
it's on our property.
So...

07:39.990 --> 07:41.617
someone tripped over this wire

07:41.660 --> 07:43.628
and now she's suing
you for $1.2 million.

07:43.660 --> 07:44.786
I feel like I'm missing
something.

07:44.830 --> 07:47.799
MAN:
Willful and wanton conduct.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.559
Ryan, there
you are.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.727
This is the other
lawyer Anna mentioned.

07:51.770 --> 07:54.591
We were just
discussing the suit.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.268
Our firm feels that _it could
offer you some a55istance.

07:57.310 --> 08:01.178
Odd, I didn't know I needed
some... assistance.

08:01.210 --> 08:03.747
Mr. and Mrs. Loeb, could you
give us a moment to talk?

08:03.780 --> 08:06.749
Yes, yes, please.

08:06.780 --> 08:09.078
Ryan, if you could
make this work,

08:09.120 --> 08:11.088
we'd prefer that.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.509
And Mrs. Florrick, next
time you see your husband,

08:13.560 --> 08:15.858
please tell him how
much he is appreciated.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.664
So I do the depositions,

08:22.700 --> 08:23.792
the pretrial motions,

08:23.830 --> 08:26.560
prep for next week's trial,

08:26.600 --> 08:28.795
and here comes the
600-pound gorilla.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.263
Yep, that's me, 600 pounds.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.299
Did you read the brief?

08:32.340 --> 08:33.671
Nope.

08:33.710 --> 08:34.677
Talk to the plaintiff?

08:34.710 --> 08:35.699
Nope.

08:35.740 --> 08:39.073
Came on this case two hours ago.

08:39.110 --> 08:41.817
Our firm is doing it
as a favor to Mrs. Loeb.

08:41.850 --> 08:44.683
Why willful and...?
Mm-hmm.

08:48.590 --> 08:49.852
Hey, I was put
on this case.

08:49.890 --> 08:50.822
It's not my choice

08:50.860 --> 08:53.590
and I really don't care
if it's your choice.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.894
You call it a 600-pound
gorilla or whatever you want,

08:55.930 --> 08:57.522
but now I'm your
second chair.

09:00.370 --> 09:02.668
They saw
the eruv wire was down,

09:02.710 --> 09:03.961
they knew it could trip
somebody up,

09:04.010 --> 09:05.739
and they didn't try
to repair it.

09:05.770 --> 09:07.306
That's why it's willful
and wanton conduct

09:07.340 --> 09:10.776
and subject
to high punitive damages.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.072
They admitted to that?

09:12.110 --> 09:13.213
In their depositions.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.969
And why would they
admit to that?

09:16.020 --> 09:17.317
The wire fell
on the Sabbath.

09:18.820 --> 09:20.617
They couldn't do anything.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.309
Wow.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.918
Yeah, it's
the perfect legal trap.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.120
They're liable
because their religion

09:25.160 --> 09:26.650
wouldn't let them act.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.292
And your defense?
My defense
is to suggest

09:28.330 --> 09:30.798
that you go tell your boss

09:30.830 --> 09:32.730
you're meeting
regularly with me

09:32.770 --> 09:35.796
and I'm doing
a great job

09:35.840 --> 09:37.603
and let me win
this case.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.164
That's not going to
happen, Mr. Alprin.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.700
We're in this together.

09:40.740 --> 09:41.934
Can't hear you.

09:48.380 --> 09:52.339
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

10:01.400 --> 10:03.391
RYAN: _
You're maintaining that
you were injured so badly

10:03.430 --> 10:05.295
as to require a
large judgment?

10:05.330 --> 10:08.731
I'm maintaining that I have pain

10:08.770 --> 10:11.204
every single day.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.276
I-I try to ignore it.

10:13.310 --> 10:17.269
I try to pick up my little girl,
but I can't.

10:17.310 --> 10:19.301
It keeps me from pushing her
on a swing.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.409
It keeps me from playing
with her on the floor.

10:21.450 --> 10:24.089
RYAN:
And this grocery store was
a half mile from your home.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.712
Why did you pass up
five closer grocery stores

10:25.750 --> 10:26.956
to go to this one?

10:26.990 --> 10:29.379
My daughter needs
gluten-free foods

10:29.420 --> 10:33.151
and, uh, this grocery store--

10:33.200 --> 10:35.998
the kosher grocery store--
had more options.

10:36.030 --> 10:37.292
KALIN DA:
Good answer.

10:37.330 --> 10:38.820
RYAN:
After you fell,
how much time passed...?

10:38.870 --> 10:40.189
Great answer.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.299
Anything to undercut
the injury testimony?

10:42.340 --> 10:44.228
I'm still checking.

10:44.270 --> 10:46.909
I mean, as far as I can tell,
nobody witnessed her fall,

10:46.940 --> 10:49.329
but I'm checking
with ﬁrst responders.

10:49.380 --> 10:52.679
Any word
from your cocounsel?

10:52.720 --> 10:55.109
No, our friend Mr. Alprin
doesn't pick up his phone.

10:55.150 --> 10:57.243
This one's a tough one.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.109
The jury's gonna love her.

10:58.150 --> 11:01.813
And you're dealing
with sympathy issues.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.851
Is that a euphemism
for something?

11:03.890 --> 11:05.426
Anti-Semitism.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.258
We'l_| deal with that
in v0ir dire.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.291
Wonder what those questions
will sound like.

11:10.330 --> 11:12.366
"Do you dislike Jews?"

11:13.400 --> 11:15.436
You're a bundle of fun today.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.199
(clattering)
MAN: You're kidding me!

11:20.340 --> 11:23.275
Layoffs.

11:23.310 --> 11:26.347
(rock music playing)

11:29.320 --> 11:32.039
* She waits, hesitates

11:32.090 --> 11:36.311
* Slips away and sneaks out
in the dawn *

11:39.490 --> 11:43.062
* He wakes, never fakes

11:43.100 --> 11:48.231
* Holds onto a dream
until it's gone *

11:52.040 --> 11:58.400
* She never says to be wary

11:58.450 --> 12:03.410
* She never says, she don't
believe, couldn't you see? *

12:03.450 --> 12:06.248
*_ "I never saw a woman
qUIte like me," she said... *

12:06.290 --> 12:08.110
(phone keypad beeping)

12:13.160 --> 12:15.958
(sultry voice):
Hi, I'm Katarina.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.969
And I am so excited
to chat with you.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.298
You must be 18 or older to chat

12:21.340 --> 12:24.002
and please have your
credit card ready.

12:33.180 --> 12:35.171
(knocking on glass)

12:39.520 --> 12:41.818
And as if life
wasn't full enough.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.420
Mr. Alprin...

12:44.460 --> 12:47.293
So, I asked for a continuance
until Monday morning

12:47.330 --> 12:49.457
because Vice cops
like to sleep in,

12:49.500 --> 12:51.320
so don't fail to show up
in court, okay?

12:51.370 --> 12:53.133
If you don't show up, you're
going to have to take a plea.

12:53.170 --> 12:54.296
(phone rings)

12:54.340 --> 12:56.900
Alprin & Associates.

12:58.110 --> 13:02.171
I thought you were taking away
his keys, Mrs. Frazzi.

13:02.210 --> 13:05.202
Okay, the arraignment
won't be until 3:00.

13:05.250 --> 13:08.242
I'll see you there.

13:14.420 --> 13:17.355
Okay, you let me know
when you can talk.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.381
I'll just...

13:19.430 --> 13:21.398
sit here and wait.

13:21.430 --> 13:24.888
So... Mrs. Florrick.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.522
Mrs. Peter Florrick.

13:26.570 --> 13:27.992
Right here
in my office.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.234
Yep.
Dressing up

13:29.270 --> 13:31.363
as a peasant and walking
amongst the serfs.

13:31.410 --> 13:32.206
That's me.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.572
So this is what idealism
looks like.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.134
I liked your husband.

13:36.180 --> 13:38.944
He was better than this
current state's attorney.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.517
Easier on DUIs and drug cases.

13:41.550 --> 13:43.848
So, here's your problem.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.983
You've got a client who
admitted to liability,

13:46.020 --> 13:47.248
and a sympathetic plaintiff.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.609
You saw the depositions?

13:48.660 --> 13:50.184
Got them from the
plaintiff's attorney.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.322
You wouldn't answer your phone.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.523
The only play I see is you
attack the medical evidence,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.551
and try to reduce
the punitive amount.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.291
What do you think
of the First Amendment?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.467
I like it.
Isaac and Anna's
religion

14:02.500 --> 14:05.003
requires they not act
on the fallen eruv wire,

14:05.040 --> 14:06.268
because it's the Sabbath.

14:06.310 --> 14:08.403
Therefore they can't be held
liable for not acting.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.101
You want to use
the First Amendment

14:10.150 --> 14:11.139
to attack a slip and fall?

14:11.180 --> 14:13.375
They believed God would
judge them if they acted,

14:13.420 --> 14:15.445
so they couldn't act.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.186
And what about OSHA v. Smith?

14:17.220 --> 14:19.438
OSHA v. Smith
can kiss my ass.

14:19.490 --> 14:20.514
Liability is outweighed

14:20.560 --> 14:22.653
by the Loebs' right
to exercise their religion.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.055
Up to what point?

14:24.090 --> 14:25.557
If they saw someone
dying outside...

14:25.590 --> 14:27.990
Well, yes, when that happens,
I will call on you,

14:28.030 --> 14:29.520
Mrs. Florrick.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.199
But you're creating a loophole
in liability law.

14:32.230 --> 14:34.198
No. The Constitution is.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.128
How long were you married?

14:36.170 --> 14:37.535
15 years, and don't do that.

14:37.570 --> 14:38.639
What?
Throw a personal

14:38.670 --> 14:41.104
question into the middle
of an intellectual argument.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.437
It gets more honest answers.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.539
Judges in civil courts
crave two things: novelty

14:46.580 --> 14:48.548
and getting
out of civil court.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.548
The First Amendment
is novel.

14:54.390 --> 14:57.382
We'd have to put a First
Amendment scholar on the stand.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.284
I was about to make calls.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.628
Give me half.

15:01.660 --> 15:03.628
How can you work there?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.160
How can I work where?

15:05.200 --> 15:06.462
What are we talking about now?

15:06.500 --> 15:08.195
Stern, Lockhart & Gardner.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.229
Oh, right.

15:09.270 --> 15:11.067
The big bad corporate overlords.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.600
Much better to work
in a storefront,

15:12.640 --> 15:14.631
fighting for DUIs
and prostitutes.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.004
Two years ago,

15:17.050 --> 15:19.041
I had a case of lead poisoning
in toys.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.047
Benny Brauer.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.342
Eight months old.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.348
Fell into a coma

15:23.390 --> 15:25.517
after sucking
on a crib mobile.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.519
The insurance company
offered to settle

15:28.560 --> 15:30.551
until your firm got involved.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.626
Isn't the point of representing
clients to help them win?

15:32.660 --> 15:33.649
Meet me in open court,

15:33.700 --> 15:35.053
I'll beat you every time.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.089
That's not what your firm did.

15:36.130 --> 15:37.620
You buried us in paper,

15:37.670 --> 15:39.661
continuances,
trial motions

15:39.700 --> 15:41.588
waiting for Benny Brauer to die.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.267
A week later,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.608
I heard your chief litigator
had a name for it.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.631
"Litigating the margins."

15:47.680 --> 15:51.047
Delaying the reward
to exhaust the opposition

15:51.080 --> 15:53.116
and therefore reduce the payout.

15:56.220 --> 15:57.642
We do pro bonos.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.510
We do death row cases.

15:59.550 --> 16:02.553
You can't tarnish an entire firm
based on one case.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.126
Sure you can.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.128
Especially when one
of the partners

16:06.160 --> 16:07.627
was the chief litigator.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.298
Will Gardner.

16:19.470 --> 16:21.472
Just give me one
second, all right?

16:22.510 --> 16:24.603
Alicia.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.572
So, Stern called for an update
on his daughter's case,

16:26.610 --> 16:28.316
and he sent you something.

16:28.350 --> 16:29.669
Me?

16:29.720 --> 16:31.642
Well, whoever we
put on the case.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.553
He's in Bora-Bora.

16:34.590 --> 16:36.717
Thanks.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.250
So, how's it going?

16:38.290 --> 16:40.258
Good.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.098
We're going for
a First Amendment defense.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.563
On a slip and fall?

16:44.600 --> 16:46.568
Religious freedom
trumps liability.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.158
Smart.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.690
Maybe I'll sneak into court,
and see how it's going.

16:49.740 --> 16:50.536
How's the cochair?

16:50.570 --> 16:52.663
He's... interesting.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.678
Interesting is good.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.678
He was saying
some things.
Yeah? What?

16:57.710 --> 16:59.598
Nothing. Another time.

17:01.650 --> 17:04.289
Look, here's

17:04.320 --> 17:05.719
my take on it.
We're too low

17:05.750 --> 17:07.183
on the totem pole
to get fired

17:07.220 --> 17:08.312
because we don't
cost enough.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.351
The problem is
these older people.

17:10.390 --> 17:12.551
_ I don't mean that
in a generational sense.

17:12.590 --> 17:15.593
I just mean, you know, the ones
who have been here longer.

17:15.630 --> 17:17.166
Thanks.
They're not
hungry enough,

17:17.200 --> 17:18.462
you know?
And they cost too much.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.639
Cary, have you ever
heard of a case here

17:20.670 --> 17:22.467
defending a toy company
against lead poisoning?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.468
No.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.398
Why, should we be on it?
No, no,

17:26.440 --> 17:27.532
it was two years ago.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.774
The kid died
when we didn't settle.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.402
Two years ago?
Why are we talking

17:30.450 --> 17:31.769
about something that happened
two years ago?

17:58.870 --> 18:00.132
ZACH:
Hey.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.306
How's homework going?

18:01.340 --> 18:02.830
Done.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.302
What've you been up to?

18:04.350 --> 18:05.339
Nothing. Homework.

18:05.380 --> 18:06.608
Oh, Grandma left
her wallet again.

18:06.650 --> 18:10.211
Can you put it by the door so
she doesn't forget it next time?

18:10.250 --> 18:11.410
Sure.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.302
Shoymer

18:35.340 --> 18:38.138
is a purely volunteer policing
force for the Hasidim.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.602
Mostly we deal with
hate crimes.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.515
And you were the first
responders on the scene?

18:41.550 --> 18:42.539
Yeah, right here.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.287
Lady was on her
back, screaming.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.844
On her back?
But she fell forward.

18:46.890 --> 18:48.414
Yeah, and then she rolled
on her back.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.179
There was a lot of broken
glass in her groceries.

18:53.460 --> 18:55.428
That came_ra seems
to have a direct View.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.428
It was put in before
the lady fell,

18:57.470 --> 18:59.791
but wasn't hooked up
till after.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.866
Oh... it's unlucky, yeah?

19:01.900 --> 19:03.561
Just happened like that.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.508
You know with all
the hate crimes

19:04.540 --> 19:07.236
around here, we have
almost every square yard

19:07.280 --> 19:09.578
of this block covered
by cameras.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.289
Can I ask a favor, Ezra?

19:17.320 --> 19:18.742
Could you stand here
for a minute

19:18.790 --> 19:20.758
where Dawn fell?

19:20.790 --> 19:23.486
Sure.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.522
(indistinct radio
communication)

19:45.250 --> 19:49.243
(both lavwers arguing
at once, overlapping)

19:49.280 --> 19:53.216
Okay, hold up, hold up.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.683
So, Mr. Alprin,
let me get this straight.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.848
You intend to argue a slip and
fall as a First Amendment issue?

19:58.890 --> 19:59.925
Yes, Your Honor.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.450
This is ridiculous,
Your Honor.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.320
They can't even keep
a straight face.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.621
In Kolatch v. Harper,

20:04.670 --> 20:06.626
1983, Your Honor,
it was argued,

20:06.670 --> 20:08.638
the Constitution
can't be segregated

20:08.670 --> 20:09.864
from peripheral
areas of law.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.709
ATTORNEY:
Kolatch v. Harper?

20:11.740 --> 20:13.378
You can't just bring up some

20:13.410 --> 20:15.275
two-bit case from 1983

20:15.310 --> 20:16.675
as a citing.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.701
That was actually
a one-bit case.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.843
It was my first one
as a litigator.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.409
And as I remember it,

20:24.450 --> 20:26.441
I lost that_case.
Yes, Sir,

20:26.490 --> 20:28.481
but it was still
a good argument.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.523
Your Honor, shouldn't a jury
be allowed to decide?

20:31.560 --> 20:34.529
Yes, that's what I argued then.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.653
ATTORNEY:
Your Honor, this is
about liability.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.362
This is not about
the Constitution.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.539
Counselor, everything's
about the Constitution.

20:42.940 --> 20:46.398
Life rarely gives you a chance
to reverse a past regret.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.409
So, what the hell?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.941
Let's let the jury decide.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.675
Step back.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.676
Oh, and, Mr. Abbott,

20:55.720 --> 20:57.540
you may call your
first witness.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.686
So, when you installed
the wire a year ago,

21:01.720 --> 21:04.553
you warned the Loebs
about maintenance?

21:04.590 --> 21:05.625
Yeah, I did.

21:05.660 --> 21:07.457
I always recommend

21:07.500 --> 21:10.799
that I be called once a month
to maintain and inspect.

21:10.830 --> 21:12.866
ABBOTT:
And how often did
the Loebs phone you

21:12.900 --> 21:14.868
after you installed it?

21:14.900 --> 21:16.492
Zero.

21:16.540 --> 21:18.303
Thank you, Mr. Knox.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.466
No more questions,
Your Honor.

21:19.510 --> 21:21.034
JUDGE:
Mr. Alprin?

21:24.580 --> 21:26.571
Good morning, Mr. Knox.

21:26.610 --> 21:28.646
Good morning.
Every time a customer

21:28.680 --> 21:30.819
phones you for maintenance,
you make money, correct?

21:30.850 --> 21:32.488
That's not why I ask them to.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.488
You ask customers
to phone you once a month

21:34.520 --> 21:35.885
not because your work
is shoddy?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.558
KNOX (scoffs):
No.

21:37.590 --> 21:38.750
Because that would mean
you'd liable in this case, too,

21:38.790 --> 21:39.757
if your work was shoddy.

21:39.790 --> 21:41.894
ABBOTT:
Objection.
Sustained.

21:41.930 --> 21:43.818
When was the last time
you were sued

21:43.870 --> 21:45.724
for shoddy workmanship,
Mr. Knox?

21:45.770 --> 21:47.431
Well, I've never been sued.

21:47.470 --> 21:49.529
And have you ever been served?

21:52.810 --> 21:54.903
I guess I might have.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.545
Isn't it true that the plaintiff
in this case tried to sue you

21:57.580 --> 21:59.468
for the shoddy workmanship
at the Loeb house,
Objection.

21:59.510 --> 22:01.842
and it was until you agreed--
with a proverbial gun

22:01.880 --> 22:03.848
to your head--
to testify for the plaintiff...

22:03.890 --> 22:06.347
Your Honor, objection!
Mr. Abbott,

22:06.390 --> 22:07.812
the question hasn't
been asked yet.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.624
Wasn't it only
when you agreed

22:10.660 --> 22:12.525
to testify against the
Loebs that the lovely

22:12.560 --> 22:15.051
Mr. Abbott over here agreed
to drop the lawsuit against you?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.453
Go ahead, you can object now.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.626
Objection, Your Honor.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.762
Overruled.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.495
You're making this
sound bad.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.939
Well, then,
help me make it sound good.

22:21.970 --> 22:24.109
You did shoddy
construction,

22:24.140 --> 22:25.129
connecting the eruv wire,

22:25.170 --> 22:26.808
you got sued,
and then you tried

22:26.840 --> 22:28.376
to blame the
customer for...
Misstates

22:28.410 --> 22:30.605
the facts! Objection!
to avoid a lawsuit yourself.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.674
RYAN:
Help me make
that sound good.

22:31.710 --> 22:32.677
ABBOTT:
Your Honor, objection.

22:32.710 --> 22:33.938
Withdrawn.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.614
Your witness.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.568
Nice cross.

23:08.580 --> 23:10.582
Thanks.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.719
Where did you go to school?

23:13.760 --> 23:16.558
So we're getting intimate now?

23:16.590 --> 23:18.148
Yes, school talk.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.623
Very personal.

23:19.660 --> 23:21.628
Samford University.

23:21.660 --> 23:23.093
Stanford, really?

23:23.130 --> 23:26.167
No, Samford.
Cumberland.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.067
Ranked in the top
133 of law schools.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.900
I make up in passion
whatI lack in law books.

23:34.940 --> 23:37.500
You're good.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.939
ABBOTT:
So,

23:39.980 --> 23:42.869
you can't use any machinery
during the Sabbath, because

23:42.920 --> 23:44.615
God would disapprove?

23:44.650 --> 23:46.208
Yes.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.650
So that's why
you couldn't call

23:48.690 --> 23:50.885
about the eruv wire
being down, because

23:50.930 --> 23:53.080
that would be
operating machinery?

23:53.130 --> 23:54.620
Yes.

23:54.660 --> 23:55.888
Okay.

23:55.930 --> 23:58.160
I think I get it.

24:00.870 --> 24:01.859
What's he got?

24:01.900 --> 24:02.832
ABBOTT:
Mrs. Loeb,

24:02.870 --> 24:05.100
this is a record of
your cell phone bill.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.906
If you could look
at the underlined item there.

24:12.780 --> 24:16.739
There's a phone call
you made at 9:33 pm.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.714
on what day?
Would you read that?

24:21.660 --> 24:23.719
September fourth?

24:23.760 --> 24:25.728
Yes, what day was that?
What day of the week?

24:30.570 --> 24:32.197
Mrs. Loeb.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.065
Fnday.

24:40.110 --> 24:41.930
ABBOTT:
That would be the Sabbath?

24:45.250 --> 24:46.877
You...

24:46.910 --> 24:49.117
made a phone call
on the Sabbath?

24:49.150 --> 24:52.017
I...

24:52.050 --> 24:54.052
I'm...

24:56.590 --> 24:58.558
Yes.

24:58.590 --> 25:00.558
ABBOTT:
And this was a call to?

25:01.600 --> 25:03.864
To my father.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.664
We've been estranged,

25:06.700 --> 25:07.997
and I...

25:08.040 --> 25:11.134
ABBOTT:
And you called at
night on your cell,

25:11.170 --> 25:13.900
so your husband wouldn't
find out about it.

25:13.940 --> 25:15.100
Is that right?

25:16.140 --> 25:18.802
Yes.

25:19.850 --> 25:22.273
I'm sorry.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.138
ABBOTT:
You did the same thing

25:27.190 --> 25:29.556
on August 7,

25:29.590 --> 25:33.754
and July 17,

25:33.800 --> 25:37.668
and June 19.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.827
Is this correct?

25:39.870 --> 25:41.861
Other Fridays?

25:41.900 --> 25:43.902
(chair squeaks,
chair legs scrape)

25:49.280 --> 25:51.840
ABBOTT:
So, Mrs. Loeb,

25:51.880 --> 25:54.348
you could
have called

25:54.380 --> 25:56.848
about _the eruv wire
being down,

25:56.880 --> 25:58.313
but you chose
not to...

26:00.790 --> 26:02.849
...thus, making
you liable.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.790
No further questions.

26:21.210 --> 26:23.599
I understand it.

26:24.950 --> 26:27.077
I understand her wanting
to phone her father.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.112
It's a betrayal.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.088
It's a weakness.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.783
Was what happened
with your husband a weakness?

26:37.390 --> 26:39.358
That's different.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.620
How is it different?

26:41.660 --> 26:43.890
She didn't
cheat on you.

26:43.930 --> 26:46.797
She lied to me.

26:46.830 --> 26:50.800
(voice quavering):
She... betrayed... everything.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.934
But it wasn't selfish.

26:57.710 --> 26:59.803
Have you forgiven your husband?

27:03.790 --> 27:07.180
Then how can you tell me
to forgive?

27:13.260 --> 27:15.251
RYAN:
Hey, I'll get back to you.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.393
They want to talk settlement.

27:18.430 --> 27:21.365
They know we've lost our
First Amendment argument,

27:21.400 --> 27:23.664
now they want to
pick our pockets.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.701
We don't have a lot of options.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.708
KATARINA:
And you're really 18?

27:31.750 --> 27:32.978
ZACH :
Yes.

27:33.010 --> 27:35.240
And what do you look like, Zach?

27:37.450 --> 27:39.418
Can I ask you a question?

27:39.450 --> 27:41.816
You can ask me anything
you want.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.889
I think I have a picture of you.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.922
It's-It's of you and a man in...

27:48.960 --> 27:50.962
it looks like a hotel room.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.908
KATARINA:
What am I wearing?

27:57.940 --> 27:59.066
ZACH:
A black bra.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.101
KATARINA:
But you sound so sexy.

28:01.140 --> 28:02.778
ZACH:
No, I don't.

28:02.810 --> 28:03.902
KATARINA:
Yes, you do.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.770
Your voice is so...

28:05.810 --> 28:07.846
It makes me want
to do things.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.857
Katarina, listen, I'm paying you

28:13.890 --> 28:16.484
so I can ask you
something serious.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.183
Somebody took photos of you
in a hotel room,

28:20.230 --> 28:22.926
and you're using drugs.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.862
And... I need to know
who took the pictures.

28:30.970 --> 28:34.906
Kid, look, I'm not Katarina.

28:34.940 --> 28:36.305
(line clicks)

28:36.340 --> 28:39.446
(dial tone)

28:39.480 --> 28:40.504
ALICIA:
Ryan Alprin?

28:40.550 --> 28:41.949
WILL:
Yeah, I saw him in court.

28:41.980 --> 28:43.015
I like him.

28:43.050 --> 28:44.517
It's like we were, out
of a law school-- hungry.

28:44.550 --> 28:46.313
Is he with
some firm?
No.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.080
He's coming here, actually,
for that settlement conference.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.951
Aren't we laying people off?

28:50.990 --> 28:53.254
Yeah, but we need
some new blood.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.758
Litigators who can do
the job of two, you know?

28:55.800 --> 28:58.018
You've met him before.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.526
VVho?
Ryan Alprin.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.891
That case involving
lead poisoning in toys?

29:01.940 --> 29:03.908
Oh, right, from two years ago.

29:03.940 --> 29:04.964
He was on the other side.

29:05.010 --> 29:05.669
The losing side.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.974
So, what, he
holds a grudge?

29:08.010 --> 29:09.932
Thinks we buried him.

29:09.980 --> 29:10.799
I'm sure we did.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.374
That's how
you kill shallow pockets.

29:12.410 --> 29:13.843
Litigating for the margins?

29:13.880 --> 29:15.916
Representing your client.

29:15.950 --> 29:18.885
If he was with a bigger firm,

29:18.920 --> 29:20.888
might have deeper pockets.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.013
Let's talk to him,
see if he's interested.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.925
Okay.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.224
I better go.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.990
RYAN:
A lot of glass here.

29:32.030 --> 29:35.761
Yes, every time we sell a piece
of our soul, we buy glass.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.238
RYAN:
Who's that?

29:38.270 --> 29:39.908
My competition.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.033
Ah.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.308
Nice coconut.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.274
Thanks.
Can I have it?

29:45.310 --> 29:47.301
No.

29:48.950 --> 29:50.508
What's our fallback position?

29:50.550 --> 29:53.587
Like you said before--
undercut the extent of injuries

29:53.620 --> 29:55.156
and try to
reduce the award.

29:55.190 --> 29:56.885
Yeah, we're still
vulnerable on punitive.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.922
I've gone over the numbers.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.099
We can settle
for double compensatory.

30:01.130 --> 30:03.155
Why didn't you divorce him?

30:03.200 --> 30:04.997
Because I didn't want to.

30:05.030 --> 30:06.190
Double compensatory

30:06.230 --> 30:08.164
handles the victim's medical,
and a bit more.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.337
That's not an answer.

30:09.370 --> 30:10.906
It's the only answer
you're getting.

30:10.940 --> 30:12.168
No one asks you?

30:12.210 --> 30:14.178
Ryan, I'm your cocounsel.

30:14.210 --> 30:16.098
I know you think

30:16.140 --> 30:18.005
you've got this cute little
spontaneous thing going...

30:18.050 --> 30:19.608
This is my take on it.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.015
You're a rule-follower.

30:21.050 --> 30:24.941
The way you dress,
the way you act.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.981
But there's this part of you
that wants freedom.

30:27.020 --> 30:27.918
Rule-breaking.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.110
Look at who you
married, look at, uh...

30:30.160 --> 30:31.081
Ryan, seriously, stop.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.519
You like people who scare you.

30:39.930 --> 30:41.636
The Loeb house, deli,

30:41.670 --> 30:42.637
parking lot, park.

30:42.670 --> 30:43.898
There are video cameras

30:43.940 --> 30:45.931
here, here, here and here.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.062
This...

30:47.110 --> 30:49.408
is what they shot.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.169
Now, there's
a three-foot clearance

30:51.210 --> 30:52.575
between the victim's head

30:52.610 --> 30:54.248
and this view.

30:54.280 --> 30:56.874
A two-foot clearance
between her feet

30:56.920 --> 30:57.989
and this view.

30:58.020 --> 30:58.941
That is either

30:58.990 --> 31:00.981
the strangest coincidence
in the world, or...

31:01.020 --> 31:01.987
Or a scam.

31:02.020 --> 31:05.922
But she had to know
exactly what the cameras saw

31:05.960 --> 31:07.484
to avoid being taped.

31:07.530 --> 31:09.896
This view
at the deli was obvious,

31:09.930 --> 31:11.522
because the cash register
was right next

31:11.570 --> 31:12.889
to the security screen.

31:12.930 --> 31:14.659
But these cameras--
the park cameras--

31:14.700 --> 31:16.395
their screens
aren't on-SIte.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.329
The only way she could see them
was at the security company.

31:21.210 --> 31:23.235
So, you think the victim
has a connection there?

31:34.220 --> 31:36.108
We'll settle for one million.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.582
RYAN:
That's unlikely.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.929
I've shown how much the
homeowners policy will pay.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.097
That's our zone.

31:41.130 --> 31:43.519
No, our zone is what
Jonas Stern can pay.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.666
Oh, so that's
what this is about?

31:46.700 --> 31:48.099
You're targeting Mr. Stern.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.199
We're aware of Mr. Stern.

31:50.240 --> 31:54.131
Then you're aware that Mr. Stern
is not stepping in on this.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.670
We're
in Mr. Stern's office,

31:55.710 --> 31:57.598
and you work for Mr. Stern,

31:57.640 --> 31:59.301
but he's not stepping in
on this?

31:59.350 --> 32:03.468
Okay. This was fun.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.683
MAN:
I have 63 security linkups--

32:06.720 --> 32:10.679
Households, businesses,
loading docks.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.587
We DVR everything
up to about six months.

32:13.630 --> 32:17.191
Do all the employees have access
to all these screens?

32:17.230 --> 32:19.061
Well, actually, it's
just the three of us.

32:19.100 --> 32:20.328
What are you looking for?

32:20.370 --> 32:22.292
Just covering my bases.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.331
_ There was _
a surveillance camera put in

32:24.370 --> 32:26.531
right where this trip and fall
happened, right?

32:26.570 --> 32:29.130
Right, but it wasn't linked
up until the next week.
Mm.

32:29.180 --> 32:32.206
In fact, we rushed it
due to that fall. There.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.706
Oh, yeah.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.116
Why rushed?

32:36.150 --> 32:37.549
Well, it's kind of
dark there at night.

32:37.580 --> 32:38.410
So someone goes there

32:38.450 --> 32:40.589
with a cherry picker
to put a camera up?

32:40.620 --> 32:41.655
That's right.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.214
And who does that?

32:43.260 --> 32:44.579
I do.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.227
ALICIA:
I think we've got our man.

32:48.260 --> 32:51.263
We've got phone records,
we've got credit card bills.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.518
Hank was within reach
of the eruv wire

32:53.570 --> 32:55.128
days before it fell.

32:55.170 --> 32:56.489
This could work.

32:56.540 --> 32:57.734
You want to do cross?

32:57.770 --> 32:59.601
No, you should.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.198
Get him to deny connection,

33:01.240 --> 33:03.299
and then go
for impeachment.

33:05.210 --> 33:07.144
I like working with you.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.670
Yep.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.142
No, I really do.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.511
What?

33:15.590 --> 33:18.024
You shouldn't do this.

33:18.060 --> 33:20.278
Do what?
Talk this way.

33:21.330 --> 33:22.592
Because you're married?

33:24.200 --> 33:25.667
For a start.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.725
Your husband
cheated on you.

33:27.770 --> 33:29.169
And so what?

33:29.200 --> 33:31.304
What does that mean?

33:31.340 --> 33:33.331
What do you want?

33:33.370 --> 33:35.338
Ryan, I've got
two teenage kids

33:35.380 --> 33:37.507
and a to-do list
you wouldn't believe.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.545
RYAN:
You're not
convmcmg me.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.514
ALICIA:
Just do the work, okay?

33:42.550 --> 33:43.539
Please?

33:43.580 --> 33:45.081
The Loebs are counting on us.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.644
Don't make this more difficult.

33:53.390 --> 33:55.620
We're doing this wrong.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.799
Probably.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.333
I can't fire another person.

34:01.370 --> 34:02.769
I can't look
another one

34:02.800 --> 34:04.358
in the eye and say,
"You're going

34:04.410 --> 34:06.366
to land somewhere,"
when I know they're not.

34:06.410 --> 34:08.378
What do you propose?

34:10.410 --> 34:12.674
You have a lifeboat
that holds 15 people

34:12.710 --> 34:14.746
or one person--
who do you put in it?

34:14.780 --> 34:17.078
Is one a priest
and one a rabbi?

34:17.120 --> 34:20.248
Stern costs just as much
as 15 litigators, Diane.

34:21.890 --> 34:24.279
You want_to make a move
against Stern?

34:24.330 --> 34:26.321
I want to save 15 jobs.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.782
Stern brought
us together.

34:27.830 --> 34:30.321
We're only a firm
because of him.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.260
The wedding is over,
the minister can go home.

34:32.300 --> 34:33.289
He costs us.

34:33.330 --> 34:34.729
He's not what
he used to be.

34:34.770 --> 34:35.759
He doesn't bring in
any clients.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.234
You know, this would be
a whole lot less galling

34:38.270 --> 34:39.066
if you were just honest.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.169
There are three
votes on this board,

34:41.210 --> 34:43.269
and you want to get rid
of the one that sides with me.

34:43.310 --> 34:45.449
This is a power play,
pure and simple.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.845
Get off it, Diane.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.269
Nothing here is pure,
and nothing here is simple.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.348
This is.

34:54.490 --> 34:56.185
(door slamming)

35:07.930 --> 35:10.262
It's going to be hard.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.404
I know. I'm sorry.

35:13.870 --> 35:17.328
I can see, even with
the small things,

35:17.380 --> 35:19.405
he doesn't trust me.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.839
It's like
with my dad

35:21.880 --> 35:23.768
after rehab the
first time.

35:24.820 --> 35:27.345
He looked at me differently.

35:27.390 --> 35:31.178
Like I was a time bomb.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.528
I'm sure he wants it to work.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.419
He does.

35:37.460 --> 35:40.190
You can't just throw a
marriage away, can you?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.435
(sniffles)

35:51.250 --> 35:52.569
You good?

35:57.980 --> 35:59.880
JUDGE:
Mr. Alprin,

35:59.920 --> 36:01.251
are you ready?

36:02.290 --> 36:04.281
Yes, Your Honor.

36:05.390 --> 36:07.324
So, you are the owner

36:07.360 --> 36:09.453
and operator
of Megalith Security.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.398
Is that right, sir?

36:10.430 --> 36:11.761
Yes, it is.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.291
And how do you know
the plaintiff?

36:14.340 --> 36:16.194
Well, I... I don't know her.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.299
You're under oath,
and you're saying

36:18.340 --> 36:19.329
you don't know her?

36:20.770 --> 36:21.930
Yes, I am.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.278
Fair enough.

36:24.310 --> 36:25.777
Sir...

36:25.810 --> 36:28.313
what's this?

36:28.350 --> 36:30.272
HANK:
It's a phone bill.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.639
RYAN:
It's your phone
bill, correct?

36:33.420 --> 36:35.456
And this number here--
you see that?

36:35.490 --> 36:37.481
That number belongs
to the plaintiff.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.828
So, was that a
wrong number, sir?

36:40.860 --> 36:42.555
Probably. I... I don't know.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.489
RYAN:
And here on this
page, did you phone

36:45.530 --> 36:47.327
that wrong number
three more times?

36:48.970 --> 36:50.392
I don't know.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.601
And this phone call
was eight minutes long.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.437
Is that typically
how long you...

36:54.480 --> 36:55.731
talk to a wrong number?

36:57.510 --> 36:59.444
Well, I would contest that bill.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.345
And this call

37:01.380 --> 37:03.610
of five minutes, and this one

37:03.650 --> 37:06.312
of 23 minutes-- would you
contest that, as well?

37:11.360 --> 37:13.453
Now, this surveillance camera
that you installed

37:13.490 --> 37:15.651
near the eruv wire

37:15.700 --> 37:17.429
in the week before the...
aCCIdent,

37:17.460 --> 37:19.360
you were in a cherry
picker bucket, right?

37:19.400 --> 37:20.867
Up there installing
the camera?

37:20.900 --> 37:22.265
Yes.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.631
And that would have put you

37:23.670 --> 37:25.638
right in the exact place
where the eruv wire

37:25.670 --> 37:27.262
attached to the
Loeb house?

37:27.310 --> 37:28.902
No, not-not
right there.

37:28.940 --> 37:30.476
Five feet away?

37:30.510 --> 37:31.670
I don't know.

37:32.710 --> 37:34.348
I didn't measure it.

37:34.380 --> 37:35.642
Well, we did.

37:35.680 --> 37:39.411
So, you were in a position
to weaken the eruv wire

37:39.450 --> 37:40.781
so that it
could fall.

37:40.820 --> 37:42.310
Objection!

37:43.490 --> 37:44.684
Kalinda, I'm in the middle
of trial.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.379
Can't this wait?
No, it can't.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.455
Look, Will was
having me look

37:48.500 --> 37:49.524
into your cocounsel.
What?

37:49.560 --> 37:50.891
He was thinking
of hiring him.

37:50.930 --> 37:51.965
It's_a standard
operating procedure.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.524
Okay.
I'm on with a friend

37:53.570 --> 37:54.696
from the bar
assoqation.

37:54.740 --> 37:57.038
They can't find
his bar number.

37:57.070 --> 37:59.334
What? Why?

37:59.370 --> 38:01.338
Because he's not a lavwer.

38:08.950 --> 38:10.770
Ryan Alprin went
to law school,

38:10.820 --> 38:13.380
but failed his bar exam and
never took it a second time.

38:13.420 --> 38:15.411
They can't find his bar
association number.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.688
How is that
even p055ible?

38:16.720 --> 38:17.880
The system is based

38:17.920 --> 38:19.649
on trust more than we think.

38:19.690 --> 38:21.089
But he's up there right now
cross-examining.

38:21.130 --> 38:22.324
Yeah, I'm still here.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.554
He's winning this case.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.067
This is not just
about the case.

38:25.100 --> 38:27.728
_ He'll be arrested-- this
is a state crime-- and you

38:27.770 --> 38:30.591
could be disbarred if you
don't take this to the judge.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.608
IfI know he's not a lawyer.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.108
Which you'll know
in two minutes.
Once the jury

38:35.140 --> 38:37.028
starts deliberating,
the verdict stands.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.071
Yeah, but we need to...
Okay. We're winning
this case.

38:39.110 --> 38:40.907
The Loebs need us
mwmmmwm.

38:40.950 --> 38:43.441
I'm not going to let Ryan...

38:44.850 --> 38:46.909
I need you to take a
walk around the block.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.349
What?!

38:48.390 --> 38:50.381
I need you to take a walk

38:50.420 --> 38:52.627
around the block now,
and we'll talk later.

38:52.660 --> 38:54.389
Wait. I want
to be clear.

38:54.430 --> 38:55.852
You want me
not to be here

38:55.900 --> 38:56.889
when I get
this information?

38:56.930 --> 39:00.491
We are minutes away from
sending this to a jury,

39:00.530 --> 39:02.498
so go for a walk.

39:05.070 --> 39:06.469
RYAN:
So, you're saying, sir,

39:06.510 --> 39:07.829
you're not connected
to the plaintiff,

39:07.870 --> 39:09.804
and yet you had access
to the eruv wire

39:09.840 --> 39:11.444
just days before it fell,

39:11.480 --> 39:13.448
you control
the placement and view

39:13.480 --> 39:14.378
of your surveillance
cameras,

39:14.420 --> 39:16.911
and you phoned the
plaintiff three times

39:16.950 --> 39:19.089
in the week before
the accident?

39:19.120 --> 39:20.849
I don't know about any of this.

39:20.890 --> 39:23.609
So, the documentation is lying?

39:23.660 --> 39:25.582
All these phone
records,

39:25.630 --> 39:27.382
all these bills...

39:27.430 --> 39:29.091
Stop.
What?

39:31.870 --> 39:33.519
(whispering):
You're resting
the defense right now.

39:33.570 --> 39:35.435
I'm not...

39:35.470 --> 39:37.097
I know you're not
a lawyer.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.360
And I'm not going to let you
endanger this case.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.606
Mr. Alprin?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.972
The defense rests,
Your Honor.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.616
This is what
you're going to do.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.082
After jury instructions,
you turn yourself in,

39:58.120 --> 39:59.758
or I'm going to the judge.

39:59.790 --> 40:00.757
This is all a mistake.

40:00.790 --> 40:02.758
Don't. I mean it.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.722
I'm sorry.

40:05.770 --> 40:08.796
No, this isn't one
of those "sorry" things.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.434
You turn yourself in, or I will.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.781
BAILIFF:
All rise.

40:29.190 --> 40:30.612
JUDGE:
Madam Foreperson,

40:30.660 --> 40:32.150
have you reached a verdict?

40:34.030 --> 40:35.691
Yes, we have,
Your Honor.

40:35.730 --> 40:37.721
How do you find?

40:41.540 --> 40:43.531
We find for the defense.

40:44.740 --> 40:47.834
Thank you, jurors,
for your services.

40:47.870 --> 40:50.134
You are dismissed.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.169
Yeah?

41:18.200 --> 41:19.736
Just quickly.

41:19.770 --> 41:22.477
Uh, this lawyer, Ryan--
I think I made a mistake.

41:23.310 --> 41:25.505
What do you mean?
I mean...

41:25.550 --> 41:27.472
I don't think he's right for us.

41:28.310 --> 41:29.641
Okay.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.840
I got it. Thanks.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.889
(sighs)

41:44.600 --> 41:46.591
(sighs)

41:46.630 --> 41:48.632
(phone vibrating)

41:53.840 --> 41:55.831
RYAN (over phone):
Hey, it's me.

41:56.910 --> 41:59.799
Look, the law
is the only thing I'm good at.

41:59.850 --> 42:02.216
It's the only thing
I've ever been good at.

42:02.250 --> 42:05.014
I made a mistake,
and I'm going to fix it.

42:05.050 --> 42:07.041
Ijust, uh...

42:09.220 --> 42:11.825
Alicia...

42:11.860 --> 42:13.680
I wanted to say to you...

42:13.730 --> 42:15.254
(phone beeps)

42:25.010 --> 42:26.966
Zach, who were you
talking to last night?

42:27.010 --> 42:28.307
Uh, no one.

42:28.340 --> 42:30.729
Jackie picked up
the extension, Zach.

42:30.780 --> 42:32.907
She said you were on
the phone with someone.

42:32.950 --> 42:34.099
Who was it?

42:34.150 --> 42:35.344
Look at me.

42:35.380 --> 42:37.268
Who was it?

42:39.020 --> 42:40.988
You wouldn't understand.
Well, I may

42:41.020 --> 42:42.988
or I may not, but you're going
to tell me anyway.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.224
I phoned a sex line.

42:54.270 --> 42:55.760
I was curious.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.062
(sighs)

42:57.100 --> 42:58.931
I_won't_ do
it again.

43:01.740 --> 43:02.900
(sighs)

43:02.940 --> 43:05.272
Mom, I said I'm not
going to do it again.

43:05.310 --> 43:06.948
I know.

43:08.980 --> 43:10.208
I can't stop

43:12.950 --> 43:16.351
but in here,
we tell each other the truth.

43:19.990 --> 43:21.628
That is the truth.

43:21.660 --> 43:22.888
You're sure?

43:22.930 --> 43:24.898
There's nothing else
you want to tell me?

43:28.070 --> 43:29.367
No.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.062
Why?
