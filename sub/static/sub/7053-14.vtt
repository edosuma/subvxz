00:10.057 --> 00:13.931
Okay... color and sound check,
Milton/Staller wedding.

00:19.485 --> 00:21.478
Linda, Neal.

00:21.554 --> 00:22.742
Hi, Mr. Staller.

00:23.155 --> 00:24.843
- Glad you could make it.
- Good to see you.

00:25.824 --> 00:28.805
Hey, take it easy, Nana.
There's no hurry.

00:29.028 --> 00:30.183
You take it easy.

00:30.184 --> 00:32.198
This my regular speed.

00:36.235 --> 00:37.882
Everyone
decent in here?

00:37.883 --> 00:39.277
Come on in,
Mrs. Staller.

00:39.417 --> 00:40.920
Look who I brought,
Shelley.

00:40.955 --> 00:43.070
This is how
David can see you

00:43.105 --> 00:44.535
in your dress
before the wedding

00:44.570 --> 00:45.781
without
the bad luck.

00:46.420 --> 00:47.465
Oh...

00:48.484 --> 00:50.201
You look stunning.

00:50.929 --> 00:53.396
Thank you
so much for...

00:53.805 --> 00:54.834
everything.

00:55.426 --> 00:57.709
I'm so happy
you're joining the family.

00:58.543 --> 01:00.129
David is lucky
to have you.

01:02.874 --> 01:04.375
Okay.

01:04.784 --> 01:05.824
I'm crying now.

01:06.426 --> 01:07.403
Let's not film
this part.

01:07.438 --> 01:09.190
No, no, no.
Turn it off, turn it off.

01:10.782 --> 01:13.529
Whoa. Whew.

01:13.564 --> 01:14.778
It'll calm him down.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.393
I didn't think
I'd be this nervous.

01:16.428 --> 01:19.690
Oh... happens
to everyone, even me.

01:19.870 --> 01:22.004
And, uh, look how
I turned out.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

01:40.563 --> 01:41.631
Lynn...

01:43.227 --> 01:44.160
Who is that man?

01:48.385 --> 01:49.194
I don't know.

01:49.229 --> 01:50.462
Must be from
Shelley's side.

01:57.101 --> 01:59.608
Just breathe, man.
No, where's your inhaler?

02:00.265 --> 02:01.987
- Where is it?
- It's here.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.715
Harry, just give us
a few minutes? Sorry.

02:08.223 --> 02:10.447
<i>You're all right.</i>
<i>Just a couple minutes.</i>

02:10.482 --> 02:12.454
- He's okay. He's okay.
- He's okay.

02:18.095 --> 02:19.446
It's okay, it's okay.

02:19.447 --> 02:22.409
I can safely say David
is not going to run.

02:22.444 --> 02:24.596
So just, uh,
everybody hang tight.

02:24.912 --> 02:25.568
He'll be fine.

02:25.635 --> 02:27.590
He's just had a little
bit of a reaction...

02:27.625 --> 02:29.231
It can't be.

02:32.127 --> 02:33.242
It can't be.

02:33.591 --> 02:35.285
<i>It can't be true.</i>

02:35.320 --> 02:36.461
What's wrong, Nana?

02:36.496 --> 02:39.150
It can't be.
It's him.

02:39.185 --> 02:40.986
<i>Nana, what are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

02:41.021 --> 02:42.319
It's--It's him.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.555
You! You!

02:49.926 --> 02:51.424
<i>Nana, what's wrong?</i>

02:51.459 --> 02:52.885
Nana, my God, what is it?

02:53.411 --> 02:54.497
Oh, my God.

02:55.339 --> 02:56.810
<i>Someone call 911.</i>

02:58.035 --> 02:59.141
Josh!

03:00.677 --> 03:01.466
<i>Sweetheart!</i>

03:03.273 --> 03:05.500
My God!
What is happening?

03:21.844 --> 03:25.608
"The Bishop Revival"

03:30.767 --> 03:31.811
Agent Dunham.

03:33.417 --> 03:34.085
Detective.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.404
Burt Manning.
We spoke on the phone.

03:35.472 --> 03:37.342
So has anyone
touched anything?

03:37.377 --> 03:38.214
M.E.'s inside.

03:38.249 --> 03:40.285
We put them in a holding
pattern until you got here.

03:40.566 --> 03:41.585
It's pretty bad.

03:42.179 --> 03:43.946
Do we have a final count
on the victims?

03:44.363 --> 03:45.746
14... so far.

03:48.075 --> 03:49.226
I quite like weddings.

03:49.757 --> 03:51.151
Did I ever tell you

03:51.186 --> 03:52.580
about when
your mother and I,

03:52.615 --> 03:54.448
<i>God rest her soul,</i>
<i>got married?</i>

03:54.483 --> 03:55.458
No, no, no.
I think I missed that one.

03:55.525 --> 03:57.259
<i>And try to stop</i>
<i>driving with both feet.</i>

03:57.294 --> 03:58.296
<i>Walter, Walter!</i>

04:01.230 --> 04:03.429
She was so beautiful,
Peter.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.943
So beautiful
in white.

04:06.802 --> 04:08.799
<i>I won't deny</i>
<i>I was never happier.</i>

04:12.107 --> 04:14.333
I kept my tuxedo
in the hope

04:14.368 --> 04:17.134
that one day I would have
a son who would wear it.

04:18.408 --> 04:20.365
You could wear it
on your wedding day.

04:20.916 --> 04:24.419
Yeah, you know, Walter?
Tuxedo styles change.

04:24.454 --> 04:25.598
Oh, nonsense.

04:25.788 --> 04:27.977
Purple never
goes out of style.

04:28.424 --> 04:31.012
And the day may come
sooner than you think.

04:33.395 --> 04:35.173
Do you think
she'll call me Dad?

04:36.246 --> 04:36.955
Who?

04:37.418 --> 04:38.542
Agent Dunham.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.372
My guess
would be no.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.719
Don't look
at me like that.

04:43.754 --> 04:45.424
She's just
what you need.

04:45.974 --> 04:47.875
Someone who can see
right through you.

04:48.277 --> 04:49.377
Agent Dunham,

04:49.445 --> 04:50.912
don't you
look lovely today?

04:51.304 --> 04:52.592
Doesn't she
look lovely, Peter?

04:52.593 --> 04:54.110
<i>You look lovely,</i>
<i>Agent Dunham.</i>

04:54.817 --> 04:56.347
Dr. Walter Bishop.
How do you do?

04:59.892 --> 05:00.817
Lose a bet?

05:01.590 --> 05:03.137
It was either that
or flying lessons.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.261
Swelling
of the vitreous humor.

05:15.961 --> 05:16.486
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

05:17.940 --> 05:19.374
Petechial hemorrhaging.

05:19.441 --> 05:21.623
Yeah, not to mention
the blue skin.

05:22.315 --> 05:23.177
It's definitely
asphyxiation.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.041
The airway's clear.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.944
Yeah, same here.

05:32.907 --> 05:33.998
No fluid in the lungs.

05:34.156 --> 05:36.391
So all the victims
that I've identified so far

05:36.426 --> 05:37.258
are on the groom's side.

05:37.668 --> 05:39.331
I mean, maybe
they came in contact

05:39.366 --> 05:40.428
with something
before the wedding.

05:40.982 --> 05:42.553
Anaphylactic shock.

05:43.285 --> 05:44.763
Maybe they're all having
an allergic reaction

05:44.798 --> 05:45.700
<i>to something they</i>
<i>ate or drank.</i>

05:46.381 --> 05:47.201
That would be logical,

05:47.269 --> 05:49.510
if they were all exposed
at the same time, I suppose.

05:49.545 --> 05:50.997
I'll have the detectives
reconstruct

05:51.032 --> 05:51.699
where they all were.

05:51.734 --> 05:52.855
We may
find a connection.

06:01.049 --> 06:02.483
She was
a Holocaust survivor.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.595
That's dreadful--

06:14.797 --> 06:16.936
To survive
a thing like that...

06:19.201 --> 06:20.669
and finish up like this.

06:22.197 --> 06:23.429
Walter, do you think

06:23.464 --> 06:24.991
this could be
a deliberate attack?

06:25.705 --> 06:26.504
I don't know yet.

06:27.281 --> 06:29.353
All I know for certain
is that

06:29.388 --> 06:33.647
these 14 people suffocated
in a room full of air.

06:36.051 --> 06:37.797
There's gotta be something
they all ate or drank.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.788
There, maybe that.

06:41.490 --> 06:43.931
God, it's hard to believe
that a few hours ago

06:43.966 --> 06:45.510
this was actually
a happy place.

07:06.724 --> 07:07.612
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

07:07.816 --> 07:10.306
We need a medic
on the second floor!

07:10.341 --> 07:11.256
All right.

07:12.020 --> 07:14.032
He's dropped his inhaler.
Grab it.

07:29.631 --> 07:32.342
<i>It's curious.</i>
<i>All 15 victims.</i>

07:33.065 --> 07:34.988
So they're all
blood relatives, then.

07:35.023 --> 07:35.628
<i>Yes.</i>

07:35.663 --> 07:36.757
All of the victims

07:36.792 --> 07:38.872
are direct descendants
of Eva Staller.

07:39.427 --> 07:41.212
Holocaust survivor.

07:41.732 --> 07:43.820
<i>And anyone not related</i>
<i>to her survived,</i>

07:43.855 --> 07:45.648
<i>along with one grandchild</i>

07:45.683 --> 07:47.516
who I think
might be illegitimate.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.662
Therefore,
not a blood relative,

07:50.043 --> 07:51.863
or I suspect
he would have perished too.

07:57.670 --> 08:00.117
Astrid,
can you come here, dear?

08:01.747 --> 08:02.866
What color is this?

08:02.901 --> 08:04.075
The blood?

08:04.808 --> 08:06.815
- It's blue.
- Good.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.701
Then I'm not
imagining it.

08:08.736 --> 08:11.113
Something has bonded
with the hemoglobin

08:11.148 --> 08:12.833
in the blood,
changing its color

08:12.868 --> 08:14.667
and robbing
the body of oxygen.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.233
I believe these
people literally

08:17.268 --> 08:19.790
suffocated
from the inside out.

08:28.378 --> 08:29.690
Walter!
No, that might...

08:31.337 --> 08:32.259
be what killed him.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.636
No, that kept him alive
longer than the others.

08:37.198 --> 08:39.929
I suspect it temporarily
weakened the toxin.

08:39.964 --> 08:42.114
That still leaves
the how.

08:42.910 --> 08:44.685
How was the toxin
delivered?

08:46.188 --> 08:47.094
<i>Mrs. Staller,</i>

08:47.129 --> 08:48.281
I understand that
you were

08:48.316 --> 08:49.454
in charge
of the guest list?

08:50.416 --> 08:51.794
Did you notice anyone

08:51.829 --> 08:53.248
who shouldn't
have been at the wedding?

08:54.648 --> 08:56.123
Someone
who wasn't invited.

08:56.158 --> 08:56.787
No.

08:56.822 --> 08:59.344
Of course, I don't know
the bride's entire family.

09:00.028 --> 09:02.032
Although,
my mother-in-law,

09:02.067 --> 09:05.100
she was very upset
with someone before--

09:06.042 --> 09:08.491
A man
I had never seen before.

09:08.526 --> 09:10.539
I thought she was just
having a moment.

09:10.574 --> 09:11.774
If we showed you
the wedding video,

09:11.809 --> 09:13.285
do you think that you would
be able to point him out?

09:13.898 --> 09:14.753
I could try.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.462
It's jasmine.

09:21.841 --> 09:23.302
Shelley picked
out the scent.

09:23.337 --> 09:25.681
Represents happiness
and love.

09:27.855 --> 09:29.785
Do you mind
giving me a moment?

09:30.069 --> 09:30.784
Of course.

09:31.941 --> 09:34.132
I'll help you
with the video.

09:34.804 --> 09:35.731
Thank you.

09:38.155 --> 09:39.381
She just said all
the rest of the candles

09:39.443 --> 09:40.603
in this place
are jasmine, right?

09:40.638 --> 09:42.086
- Mm-hmm.
- Smell that.

09:43.894 --> 09:45.058
This one's cinnamon.

09:49.115 --> 09:49.622
And?

09:49.999 --> 09:50.871
Patience, son.

09:51.770 --> 09:53.376
Just like when
you were a little boy,

09:53.906 --> 09:54.983
your mother used to say

09:55.018 --> 09:56.414
you had ants
in your pants.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.262
Put that
in the spectrometer.

09:59.297 --> 09:59.873
Okay.

10:09.758 --> 10:12.202
That's the man that
Mrs. Staller identified.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.013
Can you make it
clearer?

10:14.353 --> 10:15.315
I can try.

10:16.792 --> 10:18.592
<i>Oh, that's</i>
<i>the best I can do.</i>

10:18.627 --> 10:18.978
<i>All right.</i>

10:19.013 --> 10:21.617
Well, upload it to the joint
law enforcement database

10:21.618 --> 10:23.232
and maybe
we'll get a hit.

10:23.803 --> 10:24.673
- All right.
- <i>Walter.</i>

10:26.028 --> 10:27.389
Come here.
Take a look at this.

10:33.518 --> 10:34.630
Oh...

10:34.864 --> 10:37.374
<i>That is interesting.</i>
<i>You were right.</i>

10:37.433 --> 10:38.934
This is our toxin.

10:39.002 --> 10:40.469
Appears to be
a variant of--

10:40.820 --> 10:41.517
What is that?

10:41.671 --> 10:43.487
Hydrogen cyanide?

10:45.184 --> 10:46.336
The candle
would suggest

10:46.371 --> 10:47.743
that it
was activated by heat,

10:47.882 --> 10:50.044
<i>and then dispersed</i>
<i>into the air.</i>

10:50.045 --> 10:51.229
Well, if it was
in the air,

10:51.264 --> 10:53.051
how come it only killed
some of the guests?

10:53.883 --> 10:54.894
Good question.

10:57.365 --> 10:57.966
What?

11:00.006 --> 11:01.974
Chemical weapons.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.800
Death
by asphyxiation.

11:11.676 --> 11:12.745
The Nazis.

11:12.780 --> 11:13.969
<i>I knew this</i>
<i>was familiar.</i>

11:14.037 --> 11:15.048
The Nazis?

11:15.049 --> 11:17.322
<i>The Nazis were</i>
<i>scientific pioneers.</i>

11:17.362 --> 11:20.509
They attempted to advance
every branch of science--

11:20.577 --> 11:23.078
Molecular bombs,
flying saucers, eternal youth.

11:23.146 --> 11:25.108
<i>Before DNA</i>
<i>was even discovered,</i>

11:25.159 --> 11:28.020
Josef Mengele
wanted to create a weapon

11:28.384 --> 11:31.653
capable of targeting
specific victims,

11:31.721 --> 11:33.388
a weapon capable of--

11:33.711 --> 11:36.201
of picking people out
in a crowd,

11:36.236 --> 11:37.550
<i>just like what</i>
<i>happened here.</i>

11:38.162 --> 11:41.053
It seems that science
may have finally caught up

11:41.088 --> 11:42.477
with Nazi ambition.

11:42.822 --> 11:45.290
Mrs. Staller
was a Holocaust survivor.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.391
- Do you think that that's--
- Relevant?

11:46.459 --> 11:48.526
I don't know, Olivia.

11:49.718 --> 11:50.580
Of course,
I'm not saying

11:50.631 --> 11:52.339
that this is
the work of the Nazis.

11:52.865 --> 11:55.200
Nor suddenly
am I convinced

11:55.268 --> 11:57.302
that this
was just a murder.

11:58.024 --> 12:01.073
A wedding is
the perfect laboratory.

12:01.434 --> 12:02.879
<i>You have</i>
<i>your target group,</i>

12:02.914 --> 12:03.886
the Stallers,

12:04.210 --> 12:05.913
and you have
your control group,

12:05.948 --> 12:07.019
everyone else.

12:07.054 --> 12:07.638
Are you saying
that you think

12:07.673 --> 12:09.232
this was
a science experiment?

12:09.482 --> 12:10.394
It's a theory.

12:11.316 --> 12:13.030
And one that
I think I can prove.

12:13.487 --> 12:14.106
How?

12:14.520 --> 12:17.865
A scientist always tries
to recreate his results.

12:17.924 --> 12:19.121
<i>If I'm right,</i>

12:19.753 --> 12:21.247
this will happen again.

12:22.128 --> 12:23.993
One soy latte,
one orange juice,

12:24.028 --> 12:24.759
two yogurts.

12:25.392 --> 12:26.470
Say thank you,
Jordan.

12:26.957 --> 12:27.818
Thank you.

12:31.068 --> 12:32.645
I'd like a cup of tea,
please.

12:32.872 --> 12:35.660
And, uh, make sure
the water is very hot.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.052
Sure thing.
What kind of tea?

12:37.430 --> 12:38.910
Oh, I don't know, uh...
You pick.

12:38.978 --> 12:40.258
Whichever
is your favorite.

12:42.738 --> 12:43.810
Oh, and please...

12:44.350 --> 12:46.832
Make sure the water
is very hot.

12:51.290 --> 12:52.324
<i>So do you like her?</i>

12:52.673 --> 12:53.588
Mrs. Greenwalt?

12:54.093 --> 12:55.622
Yeah, she's nice.

12:55.623 --> 12:58.633
But she always makes us
take a nap after lunch.

12:58.864 --> 13:01.132
Well, maybe you need time
to get your energy back.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.934
I think Mrs. Greenwalt
is the one who's sleepy.

13:04.837 --> 13:06.742
<i>She's very smart,</i>
<i>your daughter.</i>

13:07.630 --> 13:08.709
Yeah, she is.

13:09.575 --> 13:11.655
Soon you'll be outsmarting
the teachers.

13:12.576 --> 13:13.411
Well, we're
already there.

13:13.479 --> 13:15.269
We're talking about
skipping her up a grade.

13:15.448 --> 13:17.282
Yeah, well, don't be
in too much of a hurry.

13:19.021 --> 13:21.057
These days
are precious.

13:22.121 --> 13:24.779
Soon
all you will have...

13:25.324 --> 13:26.838
are pictures.

13:27.727 --> 13:29.661
Hmm, that smells good.

13:29.729 --> 13:30.628
<i>Is that cinnamon?</i>

13:33.205 --> 13:33.565
Yeah.

13:34.028 --> 13:35.465
Something like that.

13:45.338 --> 13:46.462
Nine victims.

13:46.935 --> 13:48.726
Suffocated just like
the wedding in Brookline.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.177
Except unlike
the Stallers,

13:50.212 --> 13:52.074
none of these people
were related to each other.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.813
<i>Might have to rework that</i>
<i>hypothesis, Walter.</i>

13:55.215 --> 13:57.193
Maybe this toxin isn't
transmitted genetically.

13:57.534 --> 13:58.512
It's just a theory,
Peter.

14:10.335 --> 14:11.375
<i>Any surveillance?</i>

14:11.581 --> 14:13.417
No cameras inside
or on the street.

14:14.617 --> 14:16.825
Could be why our suspect
chose this place.

14:17.753 --> 14:19.020
No candles,
I suppose.

14:19.088 --> 14:20.278
Not a single one.

14:20.489 --> 14:23.352
Hey, Walter,
is there any other way

14:23.387 --> 14:24.426
that this toxin
could be delivered?

14:24.493 --> 14:26.077
<i>Any number of ways,</i>
<i>I would think.</i>

14:26.948 --> 14:30.298
Simply requires
a heat source

14:30.366 --> 14:32.067
to disperse it
into the air.

14:35.772 --> 14:37.108
What about a cup of tea?

14:37.440 --> 14:38.506
<i>Oh, yes, thank you.</i>

14:38.574 --> 14:40.723
Hmm? Oh!

14:40.843 --> 14:43.795
Oh, yes, yes,
that would work.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.314
As long as the water
was hot enough.

14:47.619 --> 14:48.485
Cinnamon.

14:50.586 --> 14:52.529
I want this cup dusted
for prints immediately.

14:52.530 --> 14:53.530
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Right away.</i>

14:54.790 --> 14:56.391
<i>Peter, can you help me?</i>

14:56.459 --> 14:59.461
That man there,
what color are his eyes?

15:10.420 --> 15:10.995
Brown.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.034
I was right
after all.

15:14.342 --> 15:16.138
It is
a targeted toxin.

15:17.914 --> 15:19.351
They all
have brown eyes.

15:19.615 --> 15:21.368
That's the common
genetic trait.

15:21.984 --> 15:24.643
Check the survivors,
but I'm sure I'm right.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.245
It's a good thing
you weren't here

15:26.280 --> 15:27.290
at the time,
Agent Broyles,

15:27.325 --> 15:28.374
or you
would be dead too.

15:29.225 --> 15:30.778
<i>So first it was a family.</i>

15:30.813 --> 15:32.257
Now it's people
with brown eyes.

15:32.292 --> 15:33.728
Why is he targeting
these people?

15:34.664 --> 15:36.164
You said you think
it's an experiment.

15:36.232 --> 15:37.072
So what--

15:37.073 --> 15:39.326
He's just killing these people
to prove that he can?

15:39.361 --> 15:40.168
Perhaps.

15:40.236 --> 15:44.052
I'm going to drive us
back to the lab.

15:44.573 --> 15:46.338
I think
I have an idea.

15:46.339 --> 15:48.569
<i>Walter...</i>
<i>Why don't I drive?</i>

15:50.312 --> 15:51.531
An idea about what?

15:53.249 --> 15:55.417
I don't know yet.

15:56.486 --> 15:58.905
Excuse me, officer.
That man over there.

15:59.355 --> 16:00.523
He's named Bischoff.

16:01.857 --> 16:03.045
You mean Dr. Bishop.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.671
Dr. Bishop.

16:05.638 --> 16:06.494
Did you
need something?

16:07.003 --> 16:08.982
No, I'm just trying
to place him.

16:11.701 --> 16:13.556
He looks just
like his father.

16:21.143 --> 16:22.533
Oh!
Is that the teacup?

16:23.546 --> 16:24.145
Yeah.

16:24.225 --> 16:26.418
But, uh, they could only
pull a partial print,

16:26.453 --> 16:28.637
so no good to run
through any databases.

16:28.672 --> 16:29.410
Oh.

16:29.618 --> 16:32.640
That's unfortunate.
But you are just in time.

16:32.788 --> 16:33.696
Just in time
for what?

16:34.156 --> 16:35.437
Show and tell,
apparently.

16:37.560 --> 16:41.474
This is a molecular model
of the toxin.

16:42.098 --> 16:44.429
This blue portion,
that's the deadly part.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.339
This red part,
that...

16:47.470 --> 16:48.703
that's
the targeted group.

16:48.771 --> 16:50.138
Um, in the first instance,

16:50.206 --> 16:51.639
the Staller family--
Agent Farnsworth?

16:52.023 --> 16:54.207
<i>And in this instance,</i>

16:54.242 --> 16:56.480
people
with brown eyes.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.304
Because he can
program the toxin

16:58.339 --> 16:59.781
to target whatever group
he wants.

16:59.849 --> 17:00.982
<i>Any group with--</i>

17:01.050 --> 17:02.517
common
physical characteristics

17:02.585 --> 17:04.618
or genetic similarities, yes.

17:05.421 --> 17:07.654
Um, tall people,
short people,

17:07.689 --> 17:09.763
<i>fat people,</i>
<i>skinny people,</i>

17:10.092 --> 17:12.280
<i>black people,</i>
<i>brown people,</i>

17:12.328 --> 17:13.429
or white people--

17:13.464 --> 17:14.737
Hey, Walter.

17:14.930 --> 17:15.550
We get it.

17:17.098 --> 17:18.800
<i>Oh... well, anyway,</i>

17:18.867 --> 17:21.742
whoever created this
was apparently proud

17:21.743 --> 17:22.646
<i>of his work.</i>

17:23.039 --> 17:24.711
<i>Although I don't know</i>
<i>why he should be, I mean--</i>

17:24.940 --> 17:26.868
Apart from
the genetic targeting,

17:27.009 --> 17:29.272
the toxin itself
is quite rudimentary.

17:29.343 --> 17:31.611
It's a blend
of chromium trioxide

17:31.646 --> 17:33.684
<i>and hydrogen cyanide.</i>

17:33.719 --> 17:34.514
Chromium trioxide?

17:35.031 --> 17:36.427
<i>That's highly regulated.</i>

17:36.462 --> 17:37.908
If this guy was buying it
in any quantity...

17:38.798 --> 17:39.562
<i>Astrid, can you--</i>

17:39.597 --> 17:41.859
Dig up any companies that
deal with chromium trioxide.

17:42.185 --> 17:43.272
So, Walter,
what were you saying

17:43.312 --> 17:44.723
<i>about him being</i>
<i>proud of his work?</i>

17:44.933 --> 17:46.316
Ah.

17:46.906 --> 17:47.707
See this?

17:48.774 --> 17:50.384
<i>That's a carbon chain.</i>

17:50.476 --> 17:51.217
It's inert.

17:51.218 --> 17:53.857
It's the signature
of the creator.

17:54.803 --> 17:56.982
Some chemists

17:57.072 --> 17:59.128
spell out their initials
in molecules.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.536
<i>Others create a symbol.</i>

18:00.537 --> 18:01.820
Are you saying
that we may be able

18:01.860 --> 18:03.694
to identify
whoever made this?

18:03.723 --> 18:05.097
Well, yes, but this
could be anybody's.

18:05.925 --> 18:10.862
Well, it looks like
a stylized "S", or a snake.

18:10.930 --> 18:11.456
Actually...

18:12.498 --> 18:14.045
<i>looks more</i>
<i>like a sea horse to me.</i>

18:14.528 --> 18:17.027
Heh, heh, a sea horse.
I suppose it could--

18:22.508 --> 18:23.449
What is it?

18:23.643 --> 18:25.437
<i>Die seepferdchen.</i>

18:26.545 --> 18:27.724
<i>The sea horse.</i>

18:28.447 --> 18:30.079
I know who created
this toxin.

18:31.050 --> 18:31.957
<i>Hey, Walter.</i>

18:32.952 --> 18:33.845
Wait, Walter...

18:33.846 --> 18:34.489
What's going on?

18:35.551 --> 18:37.552
They called him
"the sea horse"

18:37.620 --> 18:38.984
because he was
a great swimmer.

18:39.021 --> 18:41.618
<i>Okay, good for him.</i>
<i>But who is he?</i>

18:42.383 --> 18:43.471
My father.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.896
Dr. Robert Bishop.

18:49.499 --> 18:50.967
Wait, wait, wait,
your father?

18:51.001 --> 18:53.681
I told you these
were Nazi experiments.

18:54.804 --> 18:57.605
My father was
a scientific pioneer

18:57.673 --> 18:59.374
at the University
of Berlin.

18:59.475 --> 19:01.843
Yes, I know,
who came here in 1933,

19:01.911 --> 19:04.230
which is long before
the Nazis ever took power.

19:04.647 --> 19:07.129
It was 1943.

19:07.349 --> 19:08.683
Given the nature
of his work,

19:08.751 --> 19:10.251
I fudged
the date a little.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.055
Walter, what are
you telling me?

19:14.123 --> 19:15.927
That my grandfather
was a Nazi?

19:15.962 --> 19:17.156
Technically, yes.

19:17.687 --> 19:18.827
<i>Actually...</i>

19:20.172 --> 19:22.204
he worked as a spy
for the Allies,

19:22.205 --> 19:24.382
sabotaging
German research and--

19:24.383 --> 19:27.651
and smuggling scientific
information to the Americans.

19:27.803 --> 19:28.715
I...

19:29.472 --> 19:32.289
I knew I recognized
the experiment.

19:33.008 --> 19:34.619
I must have
seen the formula

19:34.654 --> 19:36.355
in one of
my father's books.

19:36.612 --> 19:37.530
Put this there.

19:40.249 --> 19:41.783
Walter, are you saying
that you think

19:41.851 --> 19:44.414
your father helped develop
the formula for this toxin?

19:44.449 --> 19:45.153
It would seem so.

19:45.221 --> 19:48.276
But of course, at the time,
it was just theoretical.

19:48.357 --> 19:50.625
DNA itself
was theoretical.

19:50.660 --> 19:53.023
That formula
has to be here somewhere.

19:53.024 --> 19:55.230
These are all of
my father's favorite books,

19:55.297 --> 19:58.125
first editions
of Goethe, Thomas Mann--

19:58.567 --> 19:59.968
And you're sure
that all those notes

20:00.035 --> 20:01.543
were hidden inside
of German novels?

20:01.592 --> 20:03.624
Oh, yes.
Yes, it was the only way

20:03.659 --> 20:05.750
he could smuggle them
out of Germany when he left.

20:07.084 --> 20:08.768
You're not gonna
find those books in there.

20:08.803 --> 20:10.211
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>
<i>They will be here.</i>

20:10.279 --> 20:12.417
These are all
the books in my library.

20:12.481 --> 20:13.545
No, they won't.

20:13.749 --> 20:14.735
Walter.

20:15.750 --> 20:16.923
They're not in there.

20:21.692 --> 20:23.078
I sold those books.

20:24.010 --> 20:25.822
All of them.
About ten years ago.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.682
You sold them.
Why?

20:37.135 --> 20:38.247
I needed money.

20:38.908 --> 20:42.641
Money?
They were my books.

20:43.112 --> 20:44.700
He left them to me.

20:46.115 --> 20:47.982
He knew how
dangerous they were.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.110
The odds that this case
has anything to do

20:51.145 --> 20:52.295
- with your father's work--
- The very thing

20:52.296 --> 20:53.888
that he was
trying to stop,

20:53.956 --> 20:55.734
<i>you</i> put back
into the world.

20:55.769 --> 20:56.884
We don't know
that for sure.

20:56.919 --> 20:57.576
Yes, we do!

20:58.794 --> 20:59.853
Of course we do.

21:01.797 --> 21:04.157
How else would whoever
is doing this

21:04.192 --> 21:05.638
have gotten hold
of the formula?

21:08.270 --> 21:10.973
And because I failed
to protect it,

21:11.558 --> 21:14.077
my father's work
is killing people.

21:54.655 --> 21:56.335
<i>So the killer</i>
<i>is using a toxin</i>

21:56.370 --> 21:59.060
based on a formula created
by Dr. Bishop's father?

21:59.095 --> 22:01.351
<i>Just another skeleton</i>
<i>in the Bishop family closet.</i>

22:01.553 --> 22:02.971
It's in a book I sold.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.625
So the formula
is very complex.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.435
We believe that the killer
must have found it

22:09.470 --> 22:10.358
in one of the books.

22:10.629 --> 22:11.896
If we can trace
the books,

22:11.964 --> 22:13.670
<i>then hopefully</i>
<i>we can find him.</i>

22:13.799 --> 22:15.633
Then do it.
Quickly.

22:15.701 --> 22:16.443
Okay.

22:19.404 --> 22:20.583
We'll find those books.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.694
<i>Come on, Bishop!</i>

22:24.743 --> 22:27.343
You sold me those books,
like, ten years ago.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.509
How am I supposed to know
where they are now?

22:30.616 --> 22:32.436
Because, Markham,
you're exactly the kind

22:32.471 --> 22:34.715
of fastidious packrat
who keeps a handwritten log

22:34.750 --> 22:35.947
of every book
he's ever sold.

22:36.054 --> 22:37.326
Such a way
with words.

22:38.390 --> 22:39.128
How is it

22:39.163 --> 22:40.558
<i>that a beautiful</i>
<i>lady like you</i>

22:40.626 --> 22:41.971
<i>is stuck</i>
<i>with this guy?</i>

22:42.027 --> 22:43.133
Uh, it's my job.

22:43.134 --> 22:44.165
Well, I got
plenty of books

22:44.200 --> 22:45.494
on how to rethink
your career.

22:46.431 --> 22:47.832
<i>What color is</i>
<i>your parachute?...</i>

22:47.900 --> 22:49.367
<i>Do what you are...</i>

22:49.368 --> 22:50.380
That's thoughtful
of you.

22:50.802 --> 22:51.755
I really need you
to find out

22:51.815 --> 22:53.263
who it was
who bought those books.

22:53.405 --> 22:54.488
Whoever did may be
in the midst

22:54.537 --> 22:55.611
of a killing spree.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.630
Hmm, sounds serious.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.806
Give me a minute,
I'll see what I can find.

23:04.897 --> 23:05.362
What?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.818
You didn't really sell
Walter's books

23:07.886 --> 23:08.864
for money, did you?

23:13.469 --> 23:15.459
Walter's got heaps
of valuable stuff.

23:15.527 --> 23:16.920
Why did you
just sell his books?

23:17.563 --> 23:19.058
<i>It was a long time ago.</i>

23:21.125 --> 23:22.600
Walter was still
in St. Claire,

23:22.668 --> 23:24.698
so I wasn't exactly very
fond of him at the time.

23:27.255 --> 23:29.334
Those books were amongst
his favorite possessions.

23:31.092 --> 23:33.450
And no, to answer
your question,

23:35.320 --> 23:36.759
I'm not proud of it.

23:40.285 --> 23:41.686
<i>They were sold last year.</i>

23:42.037 --> 23:43.711
The name I got
is Eric Franko.

23:44.323 --> 23:45.723
Lives over
in Kendall Square.

23:46.275 --> 23:47.858
He struck me
as a real weirdo.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.116
Coming from you,
that's saying something.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.241
I owe you one.

24:31.603 --> 24:33.445
Doesn't look
like he's here.

24:35.807 --> 24:39.407
Well, why don't we just
poke around for a bit?

25:16.447 --> 25:18.953
Freeze! FBI!
Get down on your knees.

25:19.317 --> 25:22.337
Don't shoot me.
Please don't shoot me.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.252
<i>I'm not a Nazi.</i>

25:25.557 --> 25:26.782
I'm an artist.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.648
<i>It's about</i>
<i>the banality of evil,</i>

25:30.683 --> 25:32.496
uh, like
the Nuremberg trials

25:32.564 --> 25:36.200
showing history's tyrants
as these regular schmucks.

25:36.523 --> 25:37.462
That's deep.

25:38.336 --> 25:40.081
Where are the books
you bought from Markham?

25:40.599 --> 25:41.523
The German novels.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.159
The ones with all
the creepy stuff inside.

25:43.778 --> 25:45.972
The <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>
meets the, uh--

25:46.812 --> 25:48.705
The evil Nazi experiment?

25:50.958 --> 25:52.083
Well, you're looking
at one of them.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.977
Uh, so what do those books
have to do with the FBI?

26:01.329 --> 26:02.379
It's a long story.

26:02.761 --> 26:04.959
So none of these have
ever been displayed.

26:04.994 --> 26:06.661
You're the only person
who's ever seen them.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.100
Sadly, the, uh,
contemporary art scene

26:09.167 --> 26:10.986
has yet to, um--

26:11.536 --> 26:14.538
fully recognize
my particular contributions.

26:14.606 --> 26:16.287
I'd like to get
these books back--

26:16.575 --> 26:18.342
or what's left of them.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.677
I'll pay you whatever
you had to pay for them.

26:19.745 --> 26:20.845
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>Sure, sure, uh...</i>

26:20.912 --> 26:22.988
It's gonna take me
a while to, uh,

26:23.023 --> 26:24.333
dig them all up, uh...

26:24.334 --> 26:26.491
<i>But you</i>
<i>should also know</i>

26:26.526 --> 26:29.994
the collage
is for sale.

26:32.766 --> 26:33.944
Or I could donate it.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.678
Your grandfather
was a fan of modern art.

26:44.147 --> 26:46.314
But I don't think
he would have appreciated this.

26:47.873 --> 26:48.975
I'm sorry, Walter.

26:49.672 --> 26:51.106
Apology
not accepted.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.825
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>this means the perpetrator</i>

27:03.860 --> 27:05.963
didn't get the formula
from the books.

27:05.964 --> 27:08.604
No, we don't see
how he could have.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.741
Then how on Earth
did he recreate the formula

27:11.776 --> 27:13.789
using my father's signature,
no less?

27:13.799 --> 27:15.969
No match on
the killer's DNA, Walter.

27:16.004 --> 27:17.421
Great.
More bad news.

27:18.041 --> 27:19.521
Wait, I don't
understand.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.639
His DNA? Where did you
get his DNA?

27:21.706 --> 27:23.386
<i>Dr. Bishop was able</i>
<i>to get some</i>

27:23.421 --> 27:24.862
from the partial
fingerprints--

27:25.310 --> 27:26.853
From the skin cells
in the oil.

27:28.656 --> 27:29.246
That's pretty amazing.

27:29.784 --> 27:31.402
<i>Not my best work,</i>
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

27:32.081 --> 27:34.894
The telomere degradation
suggested that the man

27:34.962 --> 27:36.654
was over
a hundred years old,

27:37.533 --> 27:38.833
<i>which is fascinating,</i>

27:38.868 --> 27:40.519
but not
a likely possibility.

27:40.520 --> 27:43.071
Hey, Walter, you said this toxin
could be programmed to target

27:43.140 --> 27:44.795
- <i>any genetic trait, right?</i>
- Yes.

27:45.276 --> 27:46.797
Well, could it be programmed
to target more than one?

27:46.865 --> 27:48.966
<i>Say, green eyes and</i>
<i>brown hair at the same time?</i>

27:49.572 --> 27:50.734
Yes, I suppose
it could.

27:50.802 --> 27:52.082
What are you thinking?

27:52.432 --> 27:53.517
<i>Das herrenvolk.</i>

27:54.874 --> 27:56.013
The master race.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.775
The Nazis' ultimate goal.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.175
The purification of the German
people and the white race.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.079
So Nazi science
for a Nazi agenda.

28:02.687 --> 28:04.688
All of Hitler's dreams
in one little toxin.

28:25.696 --> 28:26.928
Hey!

28:29.115 --> 28:29.986
What are you
doing there?

28:31.406 --> 28:33.189
I'm conducting a test..

28:33.879 --> 28:36.121
<i>To monitor</i>
<i>the dispersion rate</i>

28:36.156 --> 28:37.214
<i>of my experiment.</i>

28:40.687 --> 28:43.732
Please...
you can watch.

29:15.498 --> 29:16.114
Walter.

29:17.409 --> 29:18.634
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>to those rats?</i>

29:18.964 --> 29:19.587
Killing them.

29:20.032 --> 29:21.966
Well, hopefully
only the white ones.

29:23.038 --> 29:24.769
I thought you were
trying to block the toxin.

29:25.287 --> 29:26.042
I am.

29:26.171 --> 29:28.260
But I have to replicate it
before I can figure out

29:28.295 --> 29:29.037
how to stop it.

29:30.342 --> 29:32.601
Uh, Astrid
couldn't find any companies

29:32.636 --> 29:34.349
that purchased
chromium trioxide

29:34.384 --> 29:35.479
within
the past six months.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.820
But our EPA contact
suggested

29:37.855 --> 29:39.484
we search
for sodium chromate?

29:39.519 --> 29:41.081
Of course.
It's a sister compound.

29:41.082 --> 29:42.988
You treat it
with sulphuric acid,

29:43.038 --> 29:44.695
you get
chromium trioxide.

29:44.730 --> 29:47.535
Okay, well, here are
three local buyers.

29:47.570 --> 29:48.559
Do you recognize
any of them?

29:49.505 --> 29:50.247
Those two--

29:50.282 --> 29:51.494
<i>Pharmaceutical</i>
<i>companies.</i>

29:52.880 --> 29:53.984
This one
I've never heard of.

29:57.068 --> 30:00.265
<i>Shipping address</i>
<i>is 3340 Eastham Road.</i>

30:01.008 --> 30:03.450
Newton, Mass?
That's a residential address.

30:05.857 --> 30:07.053
Uh, sir?
It's Dunham.

30:07.479 --> 30:08.902
Uh, I think
we have a location.

31:04.570 --> 31:06.181
Are we clear,
Agent Doble?

31:07.529 --> 31:08.597
The air is safe.

31:08.974 --> 31:11.627
<i>We're good!</i>
<i>All clear!</i>

32:22.447 --> 32:24.581
Makes your lab
look downright homey.

32:37.395 --> 32:40.039
<i>Schwarzes haut,</i>

32:41.166 --> 32:42.811
<i>braunes haut,</i>

32:43.802 --> 32:45.135
<i>grune augen...</i>

32:45.990 --> 32:47.013
<i>Genetic traits.</i>

32:47.238 --> 32:50.265
Eye color, hair color,
skin tone--

32:50.300 --> 32:50.979
It's the works.

32:51.618 --> 32:54.909
Creating the master race
by process of elimination.

32:54.910 --> 32:56.940
<i>Guys? I think</i>
<i>I found something.</i>

33:01.753 --> 33:03.921
Looks like he was making
some kind of I.D.

33:11.099 --> 33:12.520
Walter, this is
your sweater.

33:17.458 --> 33:18.039
Walter?

33:22.970 --> 33:23.566
Walter!

33:26.356 --> 33:27.311
<i>Oh, Walter.</i>

33:27.568 --> 33:28.445
Get him out of here!

33:28.513 --> 33:30.290
We need some help
downstairs!

33:32.617 --> 33:34.143
We need that oxygen, now!

33:34.178 --> 33:35.119
- Oxygen...
- Yeah.

33:38.753 --> 33:39.534
Breathe...

33:39.569 --> 33:40.591
Just breathe, Walter.

33:40.658 --> 33:41.681
<i>Breathe.</i>

33:42.460 --> 33:43.126
Breathe.

34:02.728 --> 34:03.908
Walter,
how are you feeling?

34:05.363 --> 34:06.746
You got me out
just in time.

34:08.585 --> 34:09.955
I'd like
my sweater back.

34:10.855 --> 34:12.170
We'll work on that,
Walter.

34:12.478 --> 34:15.187
Walter, why did
he go after you?

34:16.851 --> 34:17.648
I don't know.

34:18.496 --> 34:20.764
Perhaps he knew my father
betrayed the Nazis.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.706
Were you able to get
that photo to Broyles?

34:23.967 --> 34:25.882
Yeah. He's sending it
out wide.

34:27.620 --> 34:29.092
I also found this.

34:39.065 --> 34:39.987
I know that logo.

34:42.324 --> 34:43.744
I have to check
the contents of the box.

34:47.585 --> 34:48.668
Of course.

35:03.108 --> 35:04.441
All right,
go ahead.

35:23.623 --> 35:25.625
It's the annual
World Tolerance Conference

35:25.660 --> 35:27.505
<i>at the Boston Center</i>
<i>for Performing Arts.</i>

35:27.540 --> 35:28.926
Do you know who
he's planning to target?

35:28.928 --> 35:31.021
<i>No, with that broad</i>
<i>a spectrum of genetic markers,</i>

35:31.056 --> 35:32.324
the target group
could be anybody.

35:32.359 --> 35:33.811
We need to evacuate
the building.

35:33.846 --> 35:35.084
<i>I'll call the head</i>
<i>of security.</i>

35:35.119 --> 35:36.953
But there are any number
of foreign dignitaries

35:36.988 --> 35:38.667
at that conference,
so we need to follow protocol.

35:38.844 --> 35:39.736
<i>That'll take time.</i>

35:40.055 --> 35:40.927
We may not have it.

36:30.056 --> 36:32.272
There are
many difficulties,

36:32.625 --> 36:35.420
but we must continue
to confront discrimination

36:35.455 --> 36:38.099
and uphold the rights
of the oppressed.

36:38.134 --> 36:40.215
<i>The theme</i>
<i>of this year's conference,</i>

36:40.250 --> 36:42.528
<i>"Individual</i>
<i>and Cultural Rights,"</i>

36:42.563 --> 36:44.133
<i>was not chosen lightly.</i>

36:44.337 --> 36:46.805
<i>This organization</i>
<i>has a proud tradition</i>

36:46.873 --> 36:49.533
<i>of upholding</i>
<i>both human rights</i>

36:49.568 --> 36:50.709
<i>and cultural diversity.</i>

36:50.777 --> 36:53.512
<i>Yet these goals, at times,</i>
<i>may appear difficult.</i>

36:54.067 --> 36:57.037
<i>Together, we are committed</i>
<i>to the promotion of tolerance.</i>

37:04.223 --> 37:05.176
<i>Walter?</i>

37:05.658 --> 37:09.206
Whenever you're ready,
I'll... take you home.

37:12.565 --> 37:13.401
No.

37:14.564 --> 37:15.433
I want you
to take me

37:15.501 --> 37:17.574
to the Performing
Arts center.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.198
I can stop this.

37:20.839 --> 37:21.343
Okay.

37:21.401 --> 37:23.190
We're looking for the man,
or the mechanism.

37:23.576 --> 37:26.100
A candle, a coffee urn...

37:26.345 --> 37:27.244
FBI.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.958
So... now, remember,
he could be anywhere--

37:32.251 --> 37:35.972
On the floor,
on the balconies...

37:36.426 --> 37:36.993
Anywhere.

37:43.844 --> 37:46.120
Peter, there's a candle
on every table.

37:46.939 --> 37:47.397
<i>I know.</i>

37:47.675 --> 37:48.900
They've been burning
for so long.

37:49.479 --> 37:50.435
There's no victims.

37:50.470 --> 37:51.984
He must be using
something more potent.

37:57.354 --> 37:58.592
Walter, the conference
is this way.

37:59.278 --> 38:00.310
No, Astrid.

38:00.713 --> 38:02.145
We need to take
the higher ground.

38:07.921 --> 38:09.706
- <i>I got nothing.</i>
- Nothing here, either.

38:09.741 --> 38:10.701
Keep circulating.

38:11.091 --> 38:12.868
<i>...A difference of values,</i>

38:13.326 --> 38:14.292
<i>of religions,</i>

38:15.460 --> 38:16.659
<i>and of lifestyles.</i>

38:16.694 --> 38:18.463
<i>We must take great care,</i>

38:18.913 --> 38:22.379
<i>lest our advocacy become</i>
<i>its own form of oppression,</i>

38:22.602 --> 38:25.005
<i>One that unjustifiably</i>
<i>takes sides.</i>

38:25.040 --> 38:26.504
<i>Olivia, I'm in the bar.</i>

38:27.019 --> 38:28.443
It could be
anything back here.

38:29.976 --> 38:31.723
Candles,
coffee pots--

38:32.445 --> 38:33.713
It's a disaster.

38:36.692 --> 38:37.444
Hold on a second.

38:38.755 --> 38:39.303
Peter?

38:41.487 --> 38:42.064
Whoa!

38:43.618 --> 38:45.432
Let's hold off on those
for one second.

38:50.711 --> 38:51.848
I think
I got it.

38:54.233 --> 38:56.412
We are united
by a common--

38:58.798 --> 38:59.727
Where's the victim?

39:00.560 --> 39:01.999
FBI.
Everybody, move!

39:02.034 --> 39:02.841
Please. Make room!
Make room.

39:03.149 --> 39:04.485
I said move!
Get outta my way!

39:04.520 --> 39:05.902
I need a paramedic!

39:11.353 --> 39:12.918
Bischoff!

39:15.608 --> 39:17.785
Traitor!

39:40.028 --> 39:40.974
<i>Dr. Bishop.</i>

39:43.447 --> 39:45.086
Yes, Agent Broyles?

39:45.251 --> 39:46.484
What you
did tonight--

39:46.552 --> 39:50.189
Was to use
the killer's DNA

39:50.224 --> 39:52.035
to target him
and only him

39:52.070 --> 39:53.685
using his own toxin.

39:56.923 --> 39:59.002
If you plan
to press charges,

39:59.037 --> 39:59.844
then so be it.

40:01.367 --> 40:03.296
But I don't regret
what I did.

40:15.109 --> 40:16.147
Good night,
Dr. Bishop.

40:20.802 --> 40:21.392
Olivia...

40:26.892 --> 40:28.245
That man...

40:29.161 --> 40:31.556
He--He corrupted
my father's work.

40:33.333 --> 40:34.398
I understand.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.092
No, no, it was
more than that.

40:39.638 --> 40:40.556
You see,

40:41.007 --> 40:44.653
family is very important
to me.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.377
There's nothing
I wouldn't do.

41:19.912 --> 41:20.635
What's this?

41:20.670 --> 41:21.336
It's a present.

41:22.854 --> 41:23.531
Your father's work.

41:23.566 --> 41:24.496
I had Franko
give me everything

41:24.531 --> 41:25.542
that wasn't
totally destroyed.

41:44.280 --> 41:44.997
Oh, look, Peter.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.381
<i>It's your grandfather.</i>

41:56.728 --> 41:57.822
Robert Bischoff?

41:58.573 --> 41:59.559
That was his name.

41:59.823 --> 42:01.553
He changed it
when he came over here.

42:02.705 --> 42:04.452
Your mother always said

42:04.790 --> 42:07.120
that you shared
his noble brow.

42:08.744 --> 42:10.186
<i>It's a pity you never</i>
<i>got to know him.</i>

42:11.546 --> 42:12.938
You two
would have gotten along

42:12.973 --> 42:13.951
very well, I think.

42:23.568 --> 42:24.381
You know,
there is still one thing

42:24.416 --> 42:25.530
<i>that doesn't</i>
<i>make any sense.</i>

42:26.279 --> 42:27.548
If the formula
for the toxin

42:27.583 --> 42:28.992
didn't come
from your father's notes,

42:29.248 --> 42:30.379
how did
this guy get it?

42:32.597 --> 42:33.213
Hmm.

42:34.809 --> 42:36.617
Perhaps
there are some mysteries

42:36.652 --> 42:38.895
that are destined
to remain unsolved.

42:41.127 --> 42:42.961
Thank you
for bringing these back.
