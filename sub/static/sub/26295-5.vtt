WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:04.613
.

00:04.656 --> 00:07.659
- It can be stressful planning
a wedding.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.313
Had a couple last year

00:09.357 --> 00:12.186
almost come to blows over
the table centerpieces.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.840
We called it
the War of the Roses's.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.717
How are things going
for you all?

00:21.760 --> 00:24.676
Will. Natalie.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.374
- I think we're coping
just fine.

00:26.417 --> 00:27.853
Don't you think, Nat?
- Mm-hmm.

00:27.897 --> 00:31.292
I mean, we work together all
the time so that helps.

00:31.335 --> 00:34.077
- By that she means we're used
to fighting and stress.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.079
- I always tell couples
during Pre-Cana

00:36.123 --> 00:38.908
that it's not the fighting
that undermines a marriage.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.692
It's the not fighting.

00:42.129 --> 00:45.567
- Sorry,
forgot to put it on vibrate.

00:46.611 --> 00:52.182
- It is impossible to overstate
the importance of communication

00:52.226 --> 00:55.098
in building and sustaining
a healthy marriage.

00:56.621 --> 01:00.103
- No, it's nothing.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.627
I swear no more interruptions.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.542
Where were we?

01:04.586 --> 01:06.327
- Yes...

01:06.370 --> 01:08.503
where were we?

01:08.546 --> 01:10.113
- Getting marriage advice
from a celibate man

01:10.157 --> 01:11.723
is kind of hysterical.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.552
Although I didn't know that
"Don't go to bed angry"

01:14.596 --> 01:16.337
dates back to Saint Paul.
I always thought

01:16.380 --> 01:20.080
it was something from Dear Abby
or someone.

01:20.123 --> 01:22.082
What's that about?

01:22.125 --> 01:24.562
- It's just Jay.
I got some errands to run.

01:24.606 --> 01:26.042
How about I catch up later with
you at work?

01:26.086 --> 01:27.609
I've got time.

01:27.652 --> 01:28.914
- That's okay, I can get
an Uber.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.133
- Don't be silly.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.570
I like running errands.
You know that.

01:32.614 --> 01:33.832
- I do.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.704
Just the kind that
a bride-to-be shouldn't

01:35.747 --> 01:37.575
necessarily be aware of.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.664
- Okay.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.753
- See you.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.500
- You need to keep
your phone on.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.198
- I told you I had
the Pre-Cana.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.895
What couldn't wait?
- Ray Burke.

01:52.938 --> 01:55.506
You got to go see him today.
Yeah, we're picking up chatter.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.073
He's hosting something tonight.
We want to get ears on it,

01:57.117 --> 02:00.250
so come on. Let's go.
We gotta get you prepped.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.517
- 49-year-old male,

02:06.561 --> 02:08.432
high-speed motor
vehicle collision, GCS 9.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.480
- Keith Yates, BP 94/70,
heart rate 122,

02:12.523 --> 02:15.178
sat 93% on a nasal cannula.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.006
- Mr. Yates, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.529
Can you understand
what I'm saying?

02:18.573 --> 02:20.879
He's not lucid enough to clear
the c-spine .

02:20.923 --> 02:22.838
Board and collar stay on.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.059
Let's get him in there.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.888
All right,
on my count.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.761
One, two, three.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.069
All right,
multiple facial lacs,

02:37.113 --> 02:39.855
open fracture of
the right tibia,

02:39.898 --> 02:41.378
muffled breath sounds
on the left.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.032
Let's get a chest X-ray.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.556
Sternum took a lot of impact
here, guys. What happened?

02:45.600 --> 02:47.297
- He hit a stanchion head on.
For some reason,

02:47.341 --> 02:49.299
the airbags didn't deploy.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.649
- Mm-mm.
- Clear.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.303
X-ray's up.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.871
- Big hemathorax on the left.
Let's set up for a chest tube.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.656
Give him five of morphine,
two of midazolam.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.397
- Lidocaine.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.662
- Scalpel.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.714
Tube.

03:15.978 --> 03:19.024
- Oh, glad to see you're
with us, Mr. Yates.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.243
Bolus a liter of saline,

03:20.287 --> 03:21.549
hang two unites of
uncrossed blood.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.855
- I'm still alive.
- Yes, you are.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.858
I'm gonna do a quick ultrasound
of your belly, okay?

03:26.902 --> 03:29.731
♪

03:29.774 --> 03:31.123
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:31.167 --> 03:32.255
Okay. Okay. Okay.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.257
- Let me go!

03:35.954 --> 03:37.347
I wanna die.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.741
Why won't you let me die!

03:41.743 --> 03:48.402
♪

03:51.970 --> 03:52.144
.

03:52.188 --> 03:54.799
- Have you ever seen anything
so beautiful?

03:54.843 --> 03:56.366
Look.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.281
Has your smile.

03:58.325 --> 04:01.502
- Mm, I don't know.
- Yes. Yes. I can tell.

04:01.545 --> 04:04.374
- I'm gonna go discharge
room three, okay?

04:04.418 --> 04:05.854
I'm really happy for you guys.

04:05.897 --> 04:09.031
- Thanks, April.

04:09.074 --> 04:13.905
- Can't believe how real
this is getting.

04:13.949 --> 04:16.256
Well, I better get back
to the office.

04:16.299 --> 04:17.909
Ethan.
- Bernie.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.389
- Okay.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.522
- Bye.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.742
Bernie said you two had
a nice chat.

04:24.786 --> 04:27.354
- Not sure I'd describe
it as a chat per se,

04:27.397 --> 04:29.138
but, yeah, I heard him out.

04:29.181 --> 04:32.402
- God, you know, I'm kind of
blown away to be honest.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.317
I mean, you meet a guy in AA,

04:34.361 --> 04:35.710
you got to be a little
reticent, right?

04:35.753 --> 04:38.800
- It's good he came in
with you today.

04:38.843 --> 04:41.455
- Thanks for giving him
a chance, Ethan.

04:48.505 --> 04:49.898
- Oh.
- Hi.

04:49.941 --> 04:53.902
- Hey, so is it as awkward
as I imagined?

04:53.945 --> 04:56.774
- Father Brady was a doll.
Will on the other hand...

04:58.167 --> 04:59.429
- I don't know.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.126
It's like I was supposed
to be there for him,

05:01.170 --> 05:02.650
and yet he was barely there.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.956
- Probably just pre-wedding
jitters.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.958
Unless you think it's something
more serious.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.046
- No.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.527
- All right then. Okay.
- Yeah.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.579
- It's bigger than I thought.
- It's small enough.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.189
Trust me, you want it
to have a little heft

05:20.232 --> 05:22.278
'cause it's easier to palm.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.150
- Yeah.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.457
Special Agent Ingrid Lee,
this is my brother, Will.

05:27.501 --> 05:31.374
- Hello, Will.
- Hello.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.724
I

05:33.768 --> 05:35.639
- I told you,
it's a joint task force,

05:35.683 --> 05:37.075
so the FBI's gonna be taking
the lead.

05:37.119 --> 05:38.903
- The Bureau frowns on CIs
being handled

05:38.947 --> 05:40.775
by their own family members.

05:40.818 --> 05:41.993
It'll be cleaner this way.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.995
All right, so the key for you,
Will,

05:44.039 --> 05:46.041
will be to find a place
to stash the bug

05:46.084 --> 05:48.478
so it's as close as possible
to where Ray likes to sit.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.001
- Anywhere in the vicinity,
bam,

05:50.045 --> 05:52.961
open mic night at the
Ray Burke Comedy Club.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.267
- How am I supposed to do that
if he's sitting there?

05:55.311 --> 05:57.574
- Can't you find a way to get
him out of the room?

05:57.618 --> 05:59.359
Have him go pee in a cup
or something.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.448
- You don't think
he's gonna be suspicious?

06:01.491 --> 06:03.363
Just me calling him out of
the blue, tell him I'm--

06:03.406 --> 06:04.538
I need to make a house call?

06:04.581 --> 06:06.148
- This isn't out of the blue.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.716
It's a pre-existing heart
murmur you're following up on,

06:08.759 --> 06:11.109
and Ray's the one who said
he prefers house calls.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.242
- He also knows
I'm related to a cop.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.417
- You're his doctor.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.810
That's why this is so perfect.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.029
People inherently want to trust
their doctor.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.509
- Yeah, and I'm breaking
that trust.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.859
He thinks I'm coming there
to help him.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.428
- I thought you said he was
totally on board.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.865
- We are.
He is.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.046
- My gut was telling me he was
a suicide risk

06:35.090 --> 06:36.831
as soon as I heard about
the air bag.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.223
I should have taken
more precaution.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.269
- You're a doctor,
not a clairvoyant.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.575
Don't beat yourself up.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.011
- Mr. Yates continues
to dump blood,

06:43.054 --> 06:44.882
and it's not slowing down.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.929
Heart puts 350 cc per hour,
base deficits already at 12.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.278
He needs surgery now.

06:49.321 --> 06:51.149
- Can't do that.
- He refused consent.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.195
If we operate without
his permission,

06:53.238 --> 06:54.588
it's considered assault.

06:54.631 --> 06:57.591
- He also is refusing to let us
hang any more blood.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.244
He would rip that tube out of
his own chest

06:59.288 --> 07:00.768
if he wasn't in restraints.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.900
- He's aware he'll die without
intervention?

07:02.944 --> 07:05.425
- Pretty sure that's the point.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.037
- Both parents deceased,

07:09.080 --> 07:10.952
says he never married,
no kids.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.433
- He's refusing any outside
visitors.

07:13.476 --> 07:16.261
- Huh. How soon do you think
I might be able to talk to him?

07:16.305 --> 07:18.481
- I gave him five of Ativans,

07:18.525 --> 07:20.004
so I guess another half hour
or so.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.571
- I'm gonna
have him moved upstairs

07:21.615 --> 07:24.269
in case you can get him
to change his mind.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.749
- I'll check in with you
guys later.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.838
- Okay.
- Thanks.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.759
I need a signature.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.545
- It is a petition

07:38.588 --> 07:41.461
for a dedicated bypass machine
for my satellite OR.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.767
- The board's never gonna
approve an outlay like that.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.682
- But maybe they will give
me the name of the donor

07:45.726 --> 07:47.162
who spearheaded the campaign
in the first place,

07:47.205 --> 07:51.035
and then I can go hit
him or her up for more money.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.994
- I thought the donor wanted
to remain anonymous.

07:53.037 --> 07:56.127
- Look, I am sure whoever
it is will be flattered

07:56.171 --> 07:58.869
when I come groveling for more.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.829
Ah, thank you.
You are a prince.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.007
- Dr. Choi,

08:06.050 --> 08:08.618
48-year-old male, signs of
acute alcohol toxicity.

08:10.359 --> 08:12.143
- A & O times two and wouldn't
let the medics take his vitals.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.798
- Mags, there isn't a resident
you could fob him off on?

08:14.842 --> 08:17.192
- And deprive you
of all the fun?

08:20.717 --> 08:24.155
- Sir, I'm Dr. Choi.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.809
I understand you've had
a bit too much to drink.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.158
Can you look at me?

08:27.202 --> 08:28.638
Tell me how many fingers
I'm holding up?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.687
- Bernie.
- Ethan.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.166
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.038
I told the ambulance not
to bring me here.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.649
I need to get out of here.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.390
I don't feel so good.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.657
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

08:47.701 --> 08:50.791
- April, give me hand.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.097
My stomach.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.925
- Yeah, Bernie.

08:54.969 --> 08:58.189
Let's clean him up,
get him some fluids,

08:58.233 --> 09:02.063
and order an ultrasound.
Let me know when he sobers up.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.456
- I'm telling you she needs
to see a doctor right away.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.284
- Dr. Manning,
this is Tonya Griggs,

09:06.328 --> 09:08.025
and this is her daughter,
Neela.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.766
- I don't need to be here.
- She needs to be here.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.507
Look at that bruise on
her neck.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.117
She came in last night
and went straight to bed.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.597
Didn't even say good night.

09:14.641 --> 09:17.034
This morning,
I found her crying in her room.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.383
I tried talking with her,

09:18.427 --> 09:19.863
but she won't tell me
what happened.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.952
- Okay.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.954
Hi, Neela, I'm Dr. Manning.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.869
Can you tell me how you got
these bruises?

09:25.913 --> 09:27.349
- I was just messing around
with some friends.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.264
It's really not
that big of a deal.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.918
- I'm telling you, she's not
acting herself.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.834
- Mom, please.

09:34.922 --> 09:38.142
- Maybe you should wait
outside.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.580
- Okay.
- Thank you.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.408
Okay, Neela, I'd like to get
you changed into a gown.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.236
Monique here can help you
if you prefer that.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.239
- I can do it myself.
- Sure.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.546
Thanks.

10:02.036 --> 10:02.253
