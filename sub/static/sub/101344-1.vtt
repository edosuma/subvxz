WEBVTT

00:13.077 --> 00:16.318
THICKER THAN WATER

00:33.921 --> 00:35.921
No!

00:50.645 --> 00:52.645
Zach!

00:53.805 --> 00:55.496
Zach!

00:55.646 --> 00:57.646
Zach!

01:00.527 --> 01:02.527
You OK?

01:03.087 --> 01:05.087
Graveyard again?

01:06.288 --> 01:08.288
It felt so real.

01:09.089 --> 01:12.889
It's just a bad dream.
Try to go back to sleep.

01:21.451 --> 01:24.972
We should think about getting you
a prescription for some sleeping pills.

01:27.172 --> 01:29.063
I don't know.

01:29.213 --> 01:31.213
You can't keep going on like this.

01:34.854 --> 01:36.854
But I don't want the nightmares to end.

01:37.815 --> 01:39.975
It's the only time I get to see Zach.

01:52.057 --> 01:55.138
Don't forget I got a game today.
It's semi-finals, versus Centennial.

01:55.258 --> 01:56.938
- Home or away?
- Home game.

01:57.058 --> 02:00.699
I will be there with my loudest
cheering voice, ready to embarrass you.

02:01.019 --> 02:02.670
Thank you, Dad.

02:02.820 --> 02:04.550
What about you, Mom?

02:04.700 --> 02:06.700
I'm gonna do my best.

02:07.581 --> 02:09.580
- How's your knee?
- It's good.

02:11.621 --> 02:13.862
You want me to make you
a snack for before the game?

02:13.942 --> 02:17.263
No, it's OK. I gotta go.
Don't forget, though. 4:30's the game.

02:17.343 --> 02:19.823
OK. You guys are gonna kick butt!

02:24.224 --> 02:26.225
You're gonna try and make it, right?

02:29.985 --> 02:32.266
- Did you see the mail?
- No, why?

02:32.346 --> 02:34.706
Well, we got the bill
for the new hot-water tank.

02:36.227 --> 02:38.867
- Just what we didn't need.
- Yeah.

02:40.067 --> 02:43.028
Have you given any more thought
to going back to work?

02:44.348 --> 02:47.989
You know, Colin said that the firm
just hasn't been the same without you.

02:48.389 --> 02:49.789
Might be good.

02:49.869 --> 02:53.830
You know? See your old colleagues,
think about other things for a while.

02:53.950 --> 02:58.631
I'm sorry. I know that money's tight.
I'm just not ready.

03:00.392 --> 03:02.632
I did have another thought.

03:03.952 --> 03:08.033
Maybe we could clear out the junk
in the spare room,

03:08.113 --> 03:11.754
fix it up a bit and...
rent it to a college student.

03:12.554 --> 03:14.084
Are you kidding me?

03:14.234 --> 03:17.275
I mean, we could probably
get an extra 800 bucks a month.

03:18.355 --> 03:20.156
I don't want a stranger
living in our house.

03:20.276 --> 03:23.156
It wouldn't be forever. Just until
you're ready to go back to work.

03:25.197 --> 03:29.118
That's what this is about.
You're trying to pressure me?

03:29.598 --> 03:31.678
I'm just looking for a solution.

03:32.198 --> 03:34.639
And if you have another idea,
I'm all ears.

03:34.719 --> 03:37.399
But we can't keep living
like this on one income.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.160
Why don't you make up
a flyer and post it on campus?

03:42.680 --> 03:45.441
It's just college students
and a few professors.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.611
You can handle it.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.761
OK.

03:49.922 --> 03:53.523
Semester's already started,
but we might get lucky.

03:54.323 --> 03:56.363
Right. "Lucky."

06:39.237 --> 06:41.677
"Game's about to start.
Hope you're on your way!"

06:47.158 --> 06:49.158
What are you waiting for?

06:54.640 --> 06:56.640
I'm gone, Mom.

06:58.561 --> 07:00.801
Get out of this car
and go watch Addie play.

07:04.322 --> 07:06.322
Za...

08:46.823 --> 08:48.823
You were on fire today!

08:49.904 --> 08:52.424
- No one could catch you.
- Thanks, Dad.

08:52.984 --> 08:55.825
And that goal off that
corner kick was amazing.

08:56.665 --> 08:58.665
Yeah. I got lucky.

09:01.746 --> 09:03.746
But Mom never made it, huh?

09:04.867 --> 09:07.787
I'm sorry, Addie.
I know she really wanted to.

09:08.308 --> 09:10.308
Something must have come up.

09:10.868 --> 09:12.868
Something always comes up.

09:13.789 --> 09:18.510
Try not to be too hard on her,
OK? She's trying. She really is.

09:19.670 --> 09:21.190
You always defend her.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.831
No, I'm... Hey, I'm not defending her.

09:25.311 --> 09:26.951
I'm just asking you
to cut her some slack.

09:27.071 --> 09:29.072
What do you think
I've been doing for the past year?

09:29.152 --> 09:31.392
She's acting like she's
the only one who's hurting.

09:31.472 --> 09:33.633
You know, and I lost my brother too.

09:34.993 --> 09:36.993
I know you did.

09:38.074 --> 09:40.074
You know, we're all hurting.

09:41.194 --> 09:43.715
And we're all doing our best
to get through this.

09:45.795 --> 09:47.796
It's just taking her a bit more time.

09:51.196 --> 09:53.237
Thanks for coming and watching me.

09:55.557 --> 09:57.557
You kidding?

09:57.718 --> 09:59.718
I wouldn't miss it.

10:00.078 --> 10:02.078
I'm really proud of you.

10:03.959 --> 10:06.560
- Want some ice cream?
- No, thanks. It's OK.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.880
Was that actually a no?

10:14.361 --> 10:17.442
- How'd it go?
- They won! 4-2.

10:17.762 --> 10:21.163
- Addie was the star of the game.
- That's great. Congratulations!

10:21.243 --> 10:23.243
I'm just gonna go in the shower.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.123
Addie...

10:31.285 --> 10:33.325
She really wanted both of us there.

10:34.205 --> 10:36.205
- I know.
- What happened?

10:36.566 --> 10:38.766
I tried. I really did.

10:38.846 --> 10:42.647
You can't keep not showing up
in Addie's life. It's not OK.

10:43.207 --> 10:47.368
Zach is gone, but Addie's still here,
and she needs her parents. Both of us.

10:47.448 --> 10:51.289
Hey, don't you think I know that?
I am doing the best I can.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.489
Are you? Do you really think so?

10:53.609 --> 10:57.010
What exactly were you doing,
instead of coming to watch her game?

10:57.130 --> 10:59.491
I'm sorry. I can't just put Zach's
death away

10:59.571 --> 11:01.651
and move on
like nothing happened.

11:01.731 --> 11:03.211
I didn't just move on.

11:03.331 --> 11:06.292
Someone had to step up
and be the adult in this family.

11:08.212 --> 11:09.693
Seriously...

11:09.813 --> 11:14.254
what could be so hard about coming
to watch your daughter play?

11:14.334 --> 11:18.054
We've talked about this.
I don't wanna see the other parents.

11:18.494 --> 11:20.815
I don't want their pity
or their condolences.

11:21.135 --> 11:23.375
And I don't wanna
make stupid small talk either.

11:23.496 --> 11:25.536
People just don't know what to say.

11:26.416 --> 11:28.056
It's uncomfortable for everyone.

11:28.176 --> 11:31.177
Great, fine. So then, I'm doing them
a favor by not showing up.

11:31.297 --> 11:33.297
Everyone except your daughter.

11:35.618 --> 11:37.618
I'm sorry.

11:37.938 --> 11:39.938
That wasn't fair.

11:41.379 --> 11:43.379
Look...

11:45.380 --> 11:47.380
It's just that she misses you.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.551
We both do.

11:49.701 --> 11:53.142
But I am right here.
I haven't gone anywhere.

11:53.822 --> 11:55.822
Paige, come on!

11:56.782 --> 11:59.503
Right, and now I'm supposed
to feel guilty for grieving too?

11:59.583 --> 12:01.943
That's not what I'm saying,
and you know it.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.624
No, I know that
when I wake up in the morning,

12:04.704 --> 12:08.385
I am breathing and my legs work,
but my heart is broken.

12:09.225 --> 12:12.666
And I don't know
if I will ever feel whole again.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.721
Can I help you?

13:28.001 --> 13:31.442
I was just admiring your hibiscus.
They can be real tricky to grow.

13:31.522 --> 13:33.522
You must have a real green thumb.

13:34.923 --> 13:38.603
I'm sorry, I'm Brandon.
I'm here about the room for rent.

13:39.884 --> 13:42.324
Look, I'm sorry, but we're only
looking to rent to a female.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.245
Yes, I saw that on your flyer,

13:44.325 --> 13:46.925
but I was hoping you might
be willing to make an exception.

13:47.245 --> 13:49.526
You see, my roommate, he
just bailed on me at the last minute,

13:49.606 --> 13:52.646
and there are no other rentals
available anywhere near campus.

13:53.246 --> 13:56.527
I'm clean, I'm quiet,
and I'll be at school most of the time.

13:56.607 --> 13:58.607
Really, I just need a place to sleep.

13:59.848 --> 14:03.008
I understand your predicament,
but we have a teenage daughter,

14:03.128 --> 14:05.449
so we really are
only looking for a female.

14:07.329 --> 14:09.329
I hope your luck changes.

14:09.690 --> 14:11.690
Thank you.

14:16.131 --> 14:19.692
What if it was just for a week or two,
while I looked for another place?

14:20.652 --> 14:22.693
I know none of this is your problem,

14:23.373 --> 14:25.733
but I had to sleep in my car
last night.

14:26.893 --> 14:30.214
You see, I don't know anyone here
well enough to crash with yet,

14:30.294 --> 14:32.455
and I can't afford
to keep paying for hotels.

14:35.735 --> 14:37.466
What are you studying?

14:37.616 --> 14:42.537
I'm majoring in biology-phytology,
actually, which is the study of plants.

14:42.617 --> 14:44.617
Plants. Yeah. I know.

14:45.977 --> 14:48.698
Or at least,
that's what I came here to study,

14:48.778 --> 14:52.299
if I don't have to move back to Ohio
because I can't find a place to live.

14:53.499 --> 14:56.339
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I guess I'll keep looking.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.180
And don't let your soil get too dry.

15:00.260 --> 15:04.261
It thrives best if it's in a fertile,
moist environment.

15:06.462 --> 15:08.462
Wait.

15:10.502 --> 15:13.903
If it's only for a week or two,
maybe we can make an exception.

15:14.223 --> 15:17.184
Just leave me your number.
I need to talk to my husband first.

15:17.624 --> 15:19.624
But I'll call you later tonight.

15:27.586 --> 15:30.627
I told him he could only stay
for a week or two, max.

15:31.227 --> 15:33.787
Well, two weeks rent
is better than nothing.

15:34.427 --> 15:37.388
And hopefully someone else
still calls for next month.

15:38.028 --> 15:40.028
Fingers crossed.

15:41.589 --> 15:43.589
I know you don't love this idea,

15:44.149 --> 15:47.470
but I really think it's the
best temporary solution for us.

15:48.790 --> 15:50.790
We'll see.

15:51.911 --> 15:54.151
So, what's he like?

15:54.672 --> 15:56.672
Did you get
a good feeling about him?

15:57.512 --> 15:59.162
Yeah.

15:59.312 --> 16:00.803
He's OK.

16:00.953 --> 16:02.713
Kind of nerdy, I guess.

16:02.793 --> 16:04.874
Nerdy's good. We like nerdy.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.594
He's studying phytology.

16:14.036 --> 16:16.036
Just like Zach.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.356
Yeah, that's... weird.

16:19.277 --> 16:21.277
I know.

16:23.397 --> 16:25.397
Where's he from?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.200
Paige?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Paige?

16:40.841 --> 16:42.841
Sorry, what did you say?

16:43.562 --> 16:45.562
Where's he from?

16:46.602 --> 16:50.803
I don't know. I think he said,
Ohio or Oregon.

17:01.365 --> 17:02.606
Now, this is the bathroom,

17:02.686 --> 17:05.286
and there's a linen closet in there,
in case you need fresh towels.

17:05.606 --> 17:08.847
Our room is around the corner,
and this will be your room.

17:09.967 --> 17:11.967
What about that room?

17:12.127 --> 17:14.127
That's private.

17:14.887 --> 17:17.009
There's hangers in the
closet.

17:17.089 --> 17:19.249
Laundry is in the basement.

17:25.690 --> 17:27.540
It's perfect.

17:27.691 --> 17:30.291
At least it should be a little more
comfortable than sleeping in your car.

17:32.892 --> 17:35.292
I will let you unpack
and get settled in.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.213
And let me know
if I can get you anything.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.574
Thanks, Paige.
I really appreciate it.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.974
OK.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.697
You know,
he hasn't said two words to me.

17:59.257 --> 18:01.257
I just think he's a little shy.

18:03.818 --> 18:05.818
I'm not complaining.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.579
- How'd you do on your French test?
- Comme ci, comme Ã§a!

18:12.180 --> 18:14.180
Hi, Brandon!

18:14.540 --> 18:15.541
How was your day?

18:15.621 --> 18:17.701
Good, thanks.
I'll get out of your hair.

18:18.101 --> 18:20.101
Wait. Where you going?

18:20.422 --> 18:22.742
I was just going to eat in my room,
if that's OK.

18:22.822 --> 18:24.502
No, come on.
Pull up a seat.

18:24.623 --> 18:27.303
There's some more pasta on the stove,
if you'd like me to fix you a plate.

18:27.423 --> 18:30.384
I'm good with my sandwich, thanks.
But I'll sit and join you.

18:34.865 --> 18:37.505
- So, you settling in OK at school?
- Yeah.

18:38.345 --> 18:42.106
It's a super challenging program,
but I'm really enjoying myself so far.

18:42.186 --> 18:44.107
Said no one, ever!

18:44.187 --> 18:46.187
You know, not everyone hates studying.

18:50.628 --> 18:53.749
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a copywriter.

18:53.869 --> 18:55.719
I work at an ad agency.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.229
Mostly TV spots, some web content.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.230
- That sounds like fun.
- Don't get him started.

19:02.430 --> 19:04.321
What about you, Paige?

19:04.471 --> 19:06.001
I'm a lawyer.

19:06.151 --> 19:08.151
Was a lawyer.

19:08.632 --> 19:12.392
Well, I still am a lawyer.
Just taking a little time off.

19:14.873 --> 19:18.874
One of the things that I like to do
on my downtime is to cook.

19:19.354 --> 19:21.794
So maybe I could make dinner
for everyone some time

19:21.874 --> 19:23.645
as a thank you
for letting me stay here.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.235
Well, yes please!

19:25.315 --> 19:27.716
You didn't have to say that
quite so enthusiastically.

19:29.756 --> 19:31.756
- They don't like my cooking.
- That's not true, Mom.

19:31.836 --> 19:33.997
We love the way you open
a jar of spaghetti sauce

19:34.077 --> 19:36.077
and heat it up on the stove.

19:39.718 --> 19:41.488
Seems like a good kid.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.638
Yeah, and smart, too.

19:44.399 --> 19:47.280
That program he's in only accepts
50 students a year.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.040
- Really?
- Yeah. Zach and I looked it up, once.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.520
It was gonna be his back-up school.

19:54.081 --> 19:56.081
That is impressive.

20:00.322 --> 20:02.322
Thank you.

20:04.523 --> 20:06.454
I will say this:

20:06.604 --> 20:08.364
It's nice to meet someone under 25

20:08.444 --> 20:10.764
who doesn't always
have his face buried in his phone.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.766
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm just really, really tired tonight.

20:19.846 --> 20:22.007
- Did you check the alarm?
- Paige...

20:22.607 --> 20:24.607
Good night, honey!

20:28.008 --> 20:30.008
Good night.

20:48.532 --> 20:50.973
Hey, Brandon, is it?

20:51.973 --> 20:53.973
Hi! I'm Kristie.

20:54.894 --> 20:58.294
I was impressed how you answered
the question about electrophoresis.

20:58.694 --> 20:59.695
Thanks.

20:59.775 --> 21:01.775
It almost seemed like you should be
the one up there teaching.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.256
Anyway... a couple of us meet
after class every week

21:05.336 --> 21:08.136
as part of a study group.
Would you be interested in joining?

21:08.216 --> 21:09.537
I don't think so.

21:09.617 --> 21:11.457
Really? We help each other out,

21:11.537 --> 21:13.977
fill in the gaps where maybe one of us
might have missed something.

21:14.058 --> 21:15.418
We even have a few laughs.

21:15.498 --> 21:17.658
That doesn't sound like something
that would benefit me.

21:17.738 --> 21:20.659
- Besides, I have family obligations.
- You live at home?

21:20.739 --> 21:22.379
Doesn't that
kind of cramp your style?

21:22.459 --> 21:24.390
No. Not at all.

21:24.540 --> 21:26.340
I'm actually really close
with my parents.

21:26.420 --> 21:28.270
And I... I have a sister too...

21:28.420 --> 21:31.741
that drives me crazy sometimes, but
that's what little sisters do, right?

21:31.821 --> 21:33.821
I wouldn't know. I'm an only child.

21:34.222 --> 21:37.582
That's too bad. I have to get home
for dinner now. It's my night to cook.

21:37.702 --> 21:40.303
Let me give you my number, in case
you change your mind about the group.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.383
That's OK. I won't.

21:41.463 --> 21:43.504
Or maybe we could just
grab coffee some time?

21:43.584 --> 21:45.584
I don't think so.

22:05.268 --> 22:08.189
- Sorry. I hope I didn't scare you.
- No, that's OK.

22:10.109 --> 22:13.790
- Quite a beauty!
- Yeah. Needs a lot of work, but...

22:14.310 --> 22:16.710
Right now, I'm just hoping
it's not a lost cause.

22:17.071 --> 22:19.071
Well, that's the thing with lost
causes.

22:19.351 --> 22:21.711
Just when you're ready
to give up on them, sometimes,

22:21.792 --> 22:23.792
well, they can surprise you.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.633
- Can I give you a hand?
- Yeah, sure!

22:27.753 --> 22:29.153
Are you into this stuff too?

22:29.273 --> 22:31.714
Yeah, well, I've always loved
classic cars.

22:32.954 --> 22:36.435
They may require
a little extra attention, but...

22:37.395 --> 22:38.995
but they can reward you for it.

22:39.075 --> 22:41.716
Yeah, that's what they say.
I'm still waiting for the reward.

22:44.076 --> 22:46.076
So, what do you think's wrong with it?

22:48.277 --> 22:49.757
Well, aside from needing a
transmission,

22:49.837 --> 22:52.518
it just... doesn't wanna
start right now.

22:52.878 --> 22:58.199
I... cleaned the carbs...
new spark plugs, battery, fresh fuel.

22:58.279 --> 23:00.680
- You changed the spark plugs?
- Yeah.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.960
Can I hear what it sounds like
when you try and start it?

23:06.361 --> 23:08.361
Sure.

23:21.724 --> 23:24.965
- See, it almost wants to go.
- Yeah, just wait one second.

23:30.966 --> 23:32.966
OK, try it now.

23:38.887 --> 23:41.008
Hey! Nice work!

23:44.569 --> 23:46.569
How'd you get into old cars?

23:48.930 --> 23:51.330
Well, when I was little...

23:51.410 --> 23:55.411
all my dad ever did on the weekends
was tinker around with cars

23:55.491 --> 23:59.332
or watch football, so... if I didn't
take an interest in one of them,

23:59.412 --> 24:02.412
I don't think he ever would've
said two words to me.

24:03.613 --> 24:05.613
So I take it you're not a football fan.

24:05.773 --> 24:07.773
I never really got into sports.

24:08.974 --> 24:10.544
How about yourself?

24:10.694 --> 24:12.694
Zach and I used to watch every Sunday.

24:13.295 --> 24:17.455
But... these days, I'm really
the only person who likes football,

24:17.535 --> 24:20.256
so I don't follow that closely anymore.

24:21.816 --> 24:24.337
Well, maybe we could watch
a game together, sometime.

24:24.417 --> 24:26.417
Sure.

24:27.698 --> 24:31.138
This is the sport with the pointy ball
and the big yellow forks

24:31.218 --> 24:33.219
on either side of the field, right?

24:34.059 --> 24:36.059
Yeah. That's the one.

24:37.540 --> 24:39.270
Hey, Addie!

24:39.420 --> 24:41.270
So, guess what!

24:41.420 --> 24:45.581
Brandon's an automotive genius,
and... we got the T-Bird running.

24:45.981 --> 24:49.222
It was just the spark plug order.
It's really a common mistake.

24:50.342 --> 24:52.342
That's fascinating.

24:54.303 --> 24:56.303
I better get started on dinner.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.664
Thanks again for the help.

25:02.705 --> 25:05.185
So, you wanna go for a spin?

25:05.665 --> 25:07.546
- Can I drive?
- Yeah!

25:07.626 --> 25:11.267
- As soon as you get your license!
- No! Stop!

25:15.507 --> 25:18.428
- Can I help you with anything?
- No. I got it.

25:19.588 --> 25:21.439
What are you making?

25:21.589 --> 25:23.589
It's a surprise.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.550
Do you have a food processor?

25:28.630 --> 25:30.630
Yeah. I think it's up in the cupboard.

25:35.592 --> 25:37.592
What are you working on?

25:37.752 --> 25:40.353
A colleague wanted
my opinion on a case.

25:41.513 --> 25:42.513
How come?

25:42.593 --> 25:45.994
I settled one like this a few years
ago, so he's just picking my brain.

25:48.234 --> 25:50.234
You thinking of going back to work?

25:52.035 --> 25:54.796
No. No. Just helping a friend out.

25:56.076 --> 25:59.516
If this is too personal, just tell me
to mind my own business.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.327
But...

26:02.477 --> 26:04.477
Can I ask why
you're taking some time off?

26:09.198 --> 26:11.199
We lost our son last year.

26:12.559 --> 26:14.559
I'm... I'm so sorry.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.440
Thank you.

26:19.561 --> 26:21.561
It's been a tough
time for all of us.

26:21.961 --> 26:23.961
Yes. Of course.

26:26.522 --> 26:30.203
Zach was the
light and joy in our family,

26:31.763 --> 26:35.604
and his death has left
a huge hole in all of our lives.

26:39.525 --> 26:42.605
I know what it's like to lose
someone who's close to you.

26:45.686 --> 26:49.287
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident when I was 8.

26:53.248 --> 26:55.248
I am so sorry.

26:59.889 --> 27:01.889
Who raised you?

27:02.369 --> 27:04.890
Foster homes, mostly.

27:05.610 --> 27:07.931
That's where
I taught myself how to cook.

27:09.211 --> 27:12.812
And I always tried to impress
my foster families

27:12.892 --> 27:17.493
by doing jobs around the house
to get them to like me

27:17.573 --> 27:22.294
so that they wouldn't get rid of me,
but it never really worked that way,

27:22.734 --> 27:24.734
I still moved around a lot.

27:25.174 --> 27:27.855
But I... learned
a lot of useful life skills.

27:30.975 --> 27:33.096
Considering everything
you've been through,

27:33.176 --> 27:35.376
you have an incredible outlook.

27:35.736 --> 27:37.507
Thank you.

27:37.657 --> 27:43.058
But it took me years to put
the pieces of my life back together.

27:44.338 --> 27:46.419
And thank God
for academic scholarships,

27:46.499 --> 27:48.499
or I don't know
where I'd be right now.

27:51.540 --> 27:54.420
Well, I am still putting
the pieces back together.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.301
Everyone else thinks
that I should have by now.

28:00.541 --> 28:04.142
But if I think about going back to work
or seeing friends...

28:05.783 --> 28:07.783
I don't know.

28:08.663 --> 28:10.664
It just seems so overwhelming.

28:16.105 --> 28:19.385
Sorry. I don't know
why I'm oversharing.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.466
No, you don't have to apologize.

28:24.066 --> 28:25.387
After what you've been through,

28:25.467 --> 28:28.227
I think that you're entitled
to take as much time as you need.

28:32.228 --> 28:34.228
Besides, if you ask me,

28:35.469 --> 28:37.589
the company of others is overrated.

28:43.230 --> 28:46.351
Tom yum soup,
red curry chicken and pad thai.

28:46.831 --> 28:48.951
I hope everyone likes Thai food.

28:49.072 --> 28:52.072
Brandon, this looks and smells amazing.

28:53.072 --> 28:55.273
Wait! I should've asked first.

28:55.353 --> 28:58.033
I hope no one's allergic
to peanuts or shellfish.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.514
No. No allergies here.
Unless you cooked with bees.

29:03.515 --> 29:05.315
I'm pretty sure you're safe.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.515
And candles, nonetheless.

29:07.835 --> 29:10.356
Well, everything looks
better by candlelight.

29:14.237 --> 29:15.847
This is delicious!

29:15.997 --> 29:17.997
- Really good!
- Thank you.

29:21.558 --> 29:24.479
So, anything interesting
happen at school today?

29:25.879 --> 29:27.879
Not really. But...

29:28.760 --> 29:32.040
I got stuck with Ralph Gilbert
as my science lab partner, of course.

29:32.561 --> 29:34.561
Really? I wonder how much he
had to bribe your teacher

29:34.641 --> 29:36.641
to make that happen.

29:36.881 --> 29:39.402
Poor Ralph. He's had a crush
on Addie since the third grade,

29:39.482 --> 29:41.482
but she's never
given him the time of day.

29:42.643 --> 29:45.443
- Can I go out after dinner?
- No way! It's a school night.

29:46.003 --> 29:48.003
I finished all my homework.

29:49.964 --> 29:52.925
I was thinking that maybe we
could play a board game after dinner.

29:54.405 --> 29:56.405
Like we used to.

29:58.286 --> 30:00.286
That sounds like fun. I'm in!

30:05.167 --> 30:08.888
A big block of ice?
Steam? Smokestack!

30:08.968 --> 30:10.618
Birds!

30:10.768 --> 30:13.769
Fly-Magic 8-Ball?

30:14.289 --> 30:15.929
- Tug boat!
- Time!

30:16.049 --> 30:18.290
- What the hell is that?
- It's an aircraft carrier!

30:18.410 --> 30:21.531
- It looks like a stick of butter!
- I was drawing waves!

30:21.611 --> 30:24.451
- Waves? I thought those were birds!
- OK! Our turn!

30:24.531 --> 30:26.532
- Brandon! You're drawing.
- All right!

30:27.612 --> 30:29.612
Whatever!

30:41.335 --> 30:43.295
We got this, partner! You ready?

30:43.375 --> 30:45.375
Ready!

30:58.258 --> 31:00.619
I'll just finish this chapter
and turn out the light.

31:02.139 --> 31:04.379
Why don't you turn the light out now?

31:14.342 --> 31:16.222
That was a lot of fun last night, huh?

31:16.342 --> 31:18.232
Yeah.

31:18.382 --> 31:20.023
Yeah, we should do that more often.

31:20.103 --> 31:22.423
- I was thinking that we could maybe...
- Good morning!

31:22.823 --> 31:23.984
Morning, Brandon!

31:24.064 --> 31:26.224
- How'd you sleep?
- Good, thanks!

31:26.544 --> 31:28.144
Can I make you some breakfast?

31:28.224 --> 31:29.865
Sure, that would... be great.

31:29.945 --> 31:32.465
- Eggs or waffles?
- Eggs, please.

31:32.905 --> 31:34.746
Scrambled,
if it's not too much trouble.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.516
No trouble at all.

31:36.666 --> 31:38.666
So, what were you gonna say, Mom?

31:39.867 --> 31:41.867
I don't remember, honey.

31:42.227 --> 31:44.628
How about I make a roast chicken for
dinner tonight?

31:44.708 --> 31:46.388
Does everybody like
lemon and garlic?

31:46.468 --> 31:48.629
- That sounds delicious!
- Yeah!

31:48.989 --> 31:51.309
- You're eating with us again?
- Addie!

31:51.629 --> 31:52.709
What? I didn't mean it like that.

31:52.829 --> 31:55.950
Normally, a college student would
want to spend more time on campus.

31:56.030 --> 31:59.431
Well, not everyone wants
to live on pizza and beer.

32:00.191 --> 32:02.672
Well, actually, pizza and beer sounds
like a lot of fun.

32:03.272 --> 32:05.112
It's just that I'm still new at school,

32:05.232 --> 32:07.232
and I haven't
really made any new friends yet.

32:08.273 --> 32:11.473
Well, you are more than welcome
to eat with us any time you like.

32:11.553 --> 32:14.154
- Especially if you're cooking.
- Hey!

32:15.394 --> 32:17.875
- Are you off?
- Yeah. Have a great day, guys!

32:17.955 --> 32:19.955
- Thank you!
- See you tonight.

32:22.796 --> 32:24.956
You have a stain on your sleeve.

32:28.317 --> 32:29.767
What is that?

32:29.917 --> 32:32.878
Just drop it in the laundry.
I'll take care of it later tonight.

32:33.758 --> 32:35.758
You sure?

32:37.079 --> 32:39.079
Thank you.

32:57.083 --> 32:59.083
Hey, you want a ride?

33:00.163 --> 33:02.163
You want a ride?

33:03.164 --> 33:05.805
No, it's OK. I only have
a couple more blocks to go.

33:05.885 --> 33:07.885
So what? Get in!

33:16.927 --> 33:18.927
Seat belt!

33:28.489 --> 33:30.489
What are you listening to?

33:31.690 --> 33:33.690
What?

33:34.170 --> 33:36.571
If you want, you can plug your
phone into my car stereo.

33:37.771 --> 33:39.771
OK. Sure.

33:49.094 --> 33:51.094
This song is so sick!

33:58.055 --> 34:00.296
What kind of stuff do you like
to do after school?

34:02.696 --> 34:04.697
Just hang out with friends, I guess.

34:05.057 --> 34:07.377
Maybe you and
I could hang out, sometime.

34:07.457 --> 34:09.858
I could try to sneak you
into a college bar...

34:10.538 --> 34:12.618
As long as you didn't
tell your mom or dad.

34:19.020 --> 34:22.179
So, what's your
favorite subject in school?

34:23.860 --> 34:25.831
Probably anything but calculus.

34:25.981 --> 34:26.981
Really?

34:27.061 --> 34:29.782
Well, calculus has always come
really easily to me,

34:29.862 --> 34:31.862
so let me know if
you ever want some help.

34:32.342 --> 34:34.342
OK.

34:35.422 --> 34:37.904
What are friends for? Huh?

34:39.224 --> 34:41.224
Or are we more like roommates?

34:42.585 --> 34:44.585
This is good, right here.

34:49.266 --> 34:52.507
Thank you! Thanks, for the ride.

34:52.947 --> 34:54.947
Any time, roomie!

35:01.749 --> 35:03.229
Who was that?

35:03.309 --> 35:06.590
His name's Brandon. He's a college
student renting out our spare room.

35:06.670 --> 35:08.550
You have a guy living with you?

35:08.630 --> 35:10.630
- Just for a couple weeks.
- Is he cute?

35:10.910 --> 35:12.951
Nope! He's actually pretty weird.

35:13.031 --> 35:14.711
Maybe he knows
some hot college guys.

35:14.791 --> 35:18.352
- Doubtful!
- You don't seem too happy about this.

35:19.032 --> 35:22.273
I don't know. There's just something
about him that just creeps me out.

35:22.953 --> 35:25.393
Plus, having a random guy
in your house is weird.

35:25.473 --> 35:29.594
Look on the bright side: Maybe he can
buy us some booze for homecoming.

35:29.914 --> 35:32.875
- Is he 21?
- Yeah. But he acts like he's like 40!

35:32.955 --> 35:34.515
Have you figured out what
you're gonna wear yet?

35:34.595 --> 35:36.595
No, I haven't.
I still have to go shopping.

35:36.836 --> 35:39.436
Let's go next weekend!
We can find you something hot!

35:40.597 --> 35:42.717
Shoot! Come on! If I'm late
for homeroom one more time,

35:42.797 --> 35:44.797
Mrs. Saunders is gonna kill me.

36:31.727 --> 36:34.088
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
PARTNER!

36:57.132 --> 36:59.293
Yo, Chris! Hey, Chris!

37:00.013 --> 37:02.013
Yo, Chris, man!
Wait up!

37:02.333 --> 37:04.333
Didn't you hear me calling you?

37:04.814 --> 37:07.775
It's me, Andrew Brown from Lincoln
Junior High. How's it going, man?

37:07.855 --> 37:10.735
My name's not Chris.
I never went to Lincoln Junior High.

37:10.815 --> 37:12.055
What are you talking about?

37:12.135 --> 37:14.096
You sat right in front of me
in World History class.

37:14.216 --> 37:16.496
You used to let me copy off you
in exchange for cash.

37:16.576 --> 37:18.777
Too bad we don't
have any classes together now.

37:19.577 --> 37:20.977
I'm sorry.
You seem very convinced,

37:21.057 --> 37:23.538
but I can assure you you have me
confused with someone else.

37:23.618 --> 37:25.458
Chris, man! Come on! It's me.

37:25.538 --> 37:27.619
What the hell did you do?
Enter Witness Protection or something?

37:27.699 --> 37:30.179
I told you that's not my name.
Now leave me alone.

37:30.259 --> 37:33.460
Sure thing, Chris!
Whatever you say!

37:33.980 --> 37:35.980
See you around campus!

37:42.502 --> 37:44.502
Mom?

37:46.102 --> 37:47.793
Mom, I'm home!

37:47.943 --> 37:49.943
I'm here!

37:53.624 --> 37:56.385
- What are you doing in here?
- Playing golf!

37:56.945 --> 37:59.185
- What's it look like?
- Very funny!

38:00.265 --> 38:03.026
- What you making?
- I am not sure yet.

38:04.466 --> 38:06.667
I just... I felt like
getting my hands dirty.

38:07.027 --> 38:09.027
Mission accomplished.

38:10.067 --> 38:12.067
How was school?

38:12.908 --> 38:15.188
I don't know.
It's just school, I guess.

38:16.269 --> 38:18.429
- Did you need me for something?
- No.

38:19.189 --> 38:21.189
Just wanted to say hi.

38:23.350 --> 38:25.350
You wanna try?

38:25.751 --> 38:27.751
Sure!

38:33.472 --> 38:35.472
There you go!

38:35.873 --> 38:37.873
OK, grab the sponge.

38:38.793 --> 38:40.793
Put your foot on the pedal.

38:43.234 --> 38:45.234
Not so fast!
Jeez!

38:45.595 --> 38:47.595
We driving a car
or making a pot?

38:48.195 --> 38:50.195
A little faster.

38:50.716 --> 38:52.206
A little slower.

38:52.356 --> 38:54.477
Yeah!

38:54.557 --> 38:58.037
OK, so this hand goes here very gently.

38:58.117 --> 39:00.718
The sponge is gonna go down here.
A little bit of pressure.

39:00.798 --> 39:03.078
And as you pull it up, gentle.

39:03.158 --> 39:05.319
- Like that?
- Yeah. A little more pressure.

39:05.999 --> 39:07.999
Up. Gentle.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.520
You got this!

39:11.760 --> 39:13.760
That's great! That's it!

39:21.802 --> 39:23.802
No!

39:24.323 --> 39:26.323
- Can I have a hug?
- Hey!

39:26.483 --> 39:28.483
Come on, Mom!

39:33.605 --> 39:35.845
- Man! Talk to you later!
- Catch you guys later.

40:11.493 --> 40:13.293
You really think you should
be driving in this condition?

40:13.373 --> 40:15.373
Chris, what the hell, dude! You
almost gave me a heart attack!

40:37.938 --> 40:39.938
My name's not Chris.

43:12.010 --> 43:14.010
Hi, Mom!

43:14.610 --> 43:17.851
Hey, Mom! Hey, Mom!
Hey, Mom!

43:20.011 --> 43:22.011
Hey, Mom!

44:27.065 --> 44:29.036
- Hey!
- Hi!

44:29.186 --> 44:30.636
How was your run?

44:30.786 --> 44:34.267
It was just what I needed. It always
does wonders for clearing my head.

44:34.787 --> 44:36.787
Sounds great.

44:37.107 --> 44:39.107
Maybe I should
join you sometime.

44:39.788 --> 44:41.518
Just say the word.

44:41.668 --> 44:43.909
You know, I used to try
to get Addie to join, but...

44:43.989 --> 44:47.029
if she's not chasing after a ball,
she's not interested in running.

44:49.070 --> 44:53.391
I... wanted to thank you again, for
including me in your family game night.

44:53.471 --> 44:55.791
- That was a lot of fun.
- It was, wasn't it?

44:56.511 --> 44:58.712
Although, next time, I think you're
gonna have to be Nathan's partner,

44:58.792 --> 45:00.642
'cause he thinks you're a ringer.

45:00.792 --> 45:02.792
Fair enough!

45:03.313 --> 45:07.994
Actually, my... real secret
talent is... jigsaw puzzles.

45:08.474 --> 45:11.554
I couldn't help but notice that one's
been sitting there, untouched,

45:11.635 --> 45:13.165
since I got here.

45:13.315 --> 45:15.475
- If you're stuck on it, I could...
- No.

45:18.636 --> 45:20.086
Sorry.

45:20.236 --> 45:23.677
It's just, Zach and I used to do
puzzles on Saturday morning,

45:24.117 --> 45:27.838
and that was the one that
we were doing when...

45:28.438 --> 45:31.239
I'm so sorry I brought it up.
Forget I even asked.

45:31.639 --> 45:33.639
No, it's OK.

45:33.959 --> 45:38.000
I don't seem to be able to get
myself to finish it or pack it away,

45:38.400 --> 45:40.600
so it just sits there, in limbo.

45:41.761 --> 45:43.761
There's no harm in that.

45:44.921 --> 45:46.921
I guess not.

45:48.922 --> 45:53.123
Sometimes, it's the things
we hang onto the tightest

45:53.203 --> 45:55.804
that can hold us back the most.

46:01.685 --> 46:04.445
OK, no, I'm not saying that...
I don't wanna go to college.

46:04.525 --> 46:07.486
I'm just saying that I don't really
know if I wanna go right away.

46:08.166 --> 46:10.487
Yeah, but it's really
not a good idea,

46:10.567 --> 46:13.927
because you'll make a little bit
of money at some dead-end job,

46:14.007 --> 46:15.888
you'll fall out
of the habit of studying,

46:15.968 --> 46:19.168
and then you won't wanna
go back to school. Trust me.

46:21.409 --> 46:23.449
I just don't wanna be like Zach.

46:23.929 --> 46:25.300
What?

46:25.450 --> 46:27.970
All he ever did was study, and then...

46:28.530 --> 46:32.211
Well, I wanna travel.
I wanna... see stuff.

46:33.171 --> 46:36.972
And you will. You'll have your entire
life to do all the things you wanna do.

46:37.292 --> 46:40.573
No, I know, Dad.
But that's not...

46:41.853 --> 46:44.494
- What I'm...
- It's not up for debate, actually.

46:46.454 --> 46:49.135
- Are you nervous about the big game?
- No.

46:50.055 --> 46:52.055
How are things with you and Mom?

46:53.015 --> 46:55.015
They're OK, I guess.

46:55.776 --> 46:58.497
She seems to be doing better.
Don't you think?

46:58.577 --> 47:01.137
Yeah. Yeah, it's bizarre.

47:01.817 --> 47:03.817
What do you mean?

47:04.698 --> 47:06.538
She's been under
this dark cloud for so long.

47:06.618 --> 47:08.979
Nothing we did ever helped,
and suddenly,

47:09.419 --> 47:13.380
Weird Guy comes along,
and she's all chatty and smiley again.

47:15.260 --> 47:18.581
Yeah. That's true.
But it's OK, you know.

47:18.661 --> 47:21.421
What matters most is that
your mom's finally coming back to us.

47:21.501 --> 47:24.782
Don't you think Brandon is,
like, so creepy, though?

47:25.822 --> 47:29.783
He's a... He's a bit on the awkward
side, I'd say.

47:31.023 --> 47:34.304
But again, you know, if having him
around makes your mom happy...

47:35.624 --> 47:38.345
- It's a good thing, right?
- Yeah, I guess.

47:39.545 --> 47:41.545
He won't be with us much longer.

47:41.786 --> 47:44.626
- Promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

47:46.947 --> 47:49.467
I'm starving!
I'll race you to the car!

47:49.587 --> 47:51.587
OK!

47:54.348 --> 47:56.348
I think...

47:56.989 --> 47:58.989
I got it.

47:59.549 --> 48:01.950
Nice! Just a few left!

48:10.311 --> 48:12.311
You finish it.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.487
We're home!

48:38.637 --> 48:40.637
We're in here!

48:45.159 --> 48:47.049
You...

48:47.199 --> 48:49.560
You finished Zach's
puzzle without me?

48:50.080 --> 48:51.760
Sorry, Addie.
I didn't know you wanted to help.

48:51.880 --> 48:53.880
I wasn't talking to you. Mom?

48:55.481 --> 48:59.041
I've been asking you for months
to work on this with me.

48:59.402 --> 49:01.522
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- Paige...

49:02.802 --> 49:05.563
- Why would you do this?
- Guys, it's just a puzzle.

49:05.643 --> 49:07.163
Are you kidding me
right now?

49:07.283 --> 49:11.284
You've assigned ridiculous sentimental
value to everything in this house,

49:11.364 --> 49:15.165
and the last puzzle that Zach
was working on when he died,

49:15.245 --> 49:17.245
that just means nothing to you?

49:17.765 --> 49:19.246
I could take it apart again.

49:19.366 --> 49:22.686
Or we could do a new one tonight,
together, as a family.

49:22.766 --> 49:24.727
"As a family."
You're not part of this family.

49:24.807 --> 49:26.807
Addie!

49:29.128 --> 49:31.248
She has every right to be upset.

49:32.848 --> 49:34.529
The puzzle was my idea.

49:34.609 --> 49:36.689
I feel terrible for upsetting anyone,

49:36.809 --> 49:38.890
especially after
you've all been so kind to me.

49:38.970 --> 49:42.610
I know we agreed that you would have
kitchen and laundry privileges,

49:43.131 --> 49:44.901
but I think beyond that...

49:45.051 --> 49:48.092
- Wait, what are you talking about?
- I'm sorry if I overstepped.

49:49.412 --> 49:51.812
- I'm gonna sleep at Kara's tonight.
- Addie...

49:52.212 --> 49:54.893
I'm sorry that I finished
Zach's puzzle without you.

49:57.854 --> 50:00.134
I guess I'll see you
at Kara's barbecue tomorrow?

50:00.774 --> 50:02.774
You're going?

50:03.335 --> 50:05.335
What's this barbecue all about?

50:18.018 --> 50:20.018
Addie!

50:25.459 --> 50:27.459
Hey...

50:28.780 --> 50:31.981
Listen, you don't have to say anything
if you don't want. I get it.

50:35.021 --> 50:39.302
You know, every time I talk to her,
it's like she doesn't even hear me.

50:40.783 --> 50:43.743
She's not even listening
to what I'm saying, and...

50:44.663 --> 50:46.504
Homecoming's coming up
in a couple weeks,

50:46.584 --> 50:49.104
and she hasn't even offered
to take me dress shopping.

50:50.304 --> 50:52.265
Normally, I'd be fighting her off
from dragging me

50:52.345 --> 50:54.825
to every boutique
store and every shoe store in town.

50:54.905 --> 50:56.586
Hey, I can take you.

50:56.706 --> 50:59.746
That's just it, Dad. You shouldn't
have to be covering for her.

51:01.867 --> 51:03.867
We just need to be patient.

51:06.388 --> 51:08.388
I just want my mom back.

51:08.788 --> 51:10.788
I know.

51:18.110 --> 51:20.110
I was thinking...

51:20.791 --> 51:23.911
When school's done I could get a job
at a coffee shop or something.

51:24.031 --> 51:25.842
Why?

51:25.992 --> 51:27.992
Help with the bills.

51:28.272 --> 51:30.513
That way we don't
have to have a tenant anymore.

51:31.033 --> 51:34.074
You just focus on your schoolwork
and soccer, OK?

51:34.554 --> 51:36.554
Let me worry about the bills.

51:37.354 --> 51:40.555
OK. Thanks, Dad. Bye!

51:42.075 --> 51:45.036
Have fun at Kara's. Text me later.

51:45.516 --> 51:47.516
Yeah, I will.

52:00.359 --> 52:04.840
He's always hanging out with
my parents, which is weird enough.

52:04.920 --> 52:08.121
He never gets a text or a call.
I swear he has no friends.

52:08.441 --> 52:10.561
Well, he's new here.
Maybe he hasn't made any friends yet.

52:10.641 --> 52:12.081
Hello! Have you ever
heard of a phone?

52:12.161 --> 52:15.042
You can still keep in contact
with friends if you had them.

52:16.402 --> 52:18.402
Let's check out his page.

52:18.723 --> 52:21.523
- What's his last name?
- Wilson.

52:24.604 --> 52:26.604
That's him. Second one.

52:27.124 --> 52:29.245
He's cute!

52:31.085 --> 52:34.566
But I'll tell you
what is kind of strange.

52:35.206 --> 52:37.727
He only created this page
two years ago.

52:38.967 --> 52:42.048
No past work or education.

52:42.728 --> 52:45.088
No places listed
where he used to live.

52:47.049 --> 52:49.609
- He's not in a relationship.
- Shocker!

52:50.049 --> 52:52.690
And he has almost no likes from anyone.

52:52.770 --> 52:54.690
Yeah, look!
All of his pictures are selfies!

52:54.770 --> 52:56.931
There's not a single other
person in any of those photos.

52:57.051 --> 53:00.011
It's like he didn't even exist
until a couple years ago.

53:01.492 --> 53:02.942
What?

53:03.092 --> 53:05.332
I accidentally clicked "like"
on one of his pictures.

53:05.412 --> 53:06.973
- No, you didn't!
- I'm sorry.

53:07.053 --> 53:10.373
Oh my God! Now he's gonna know
we were looking at his page!

53:11.014 --> 53:13.294
- Maybe he'll be flattered.
- I hope not!

53:28.217 --> 53:30.218
Kara Crawford liked your post.

53:58.783 --> 54:00.554
You ready?

54:00.704 --> 54:02.704
Sure.

54:03.304 --> 54:05.304
We don't have to do this.

54:06.065 --> 54:09.826
We can just go home and tell them
that I wasn't feeling well, or...

54:09.906 --> 54:11.906
or got called into the office.

54:16.507 --> 54:19.068
I'm ready. Let's go.

54:19.668 --> 54:21.668
All right.

54:26.509 --> 54:28.149
...thought the judge
was gonna have a stroke

54:28.230 --> 54:30.510
when I asked for another
continuance, but it worked.

54:30.910 --> 54:32.910
Second biggest settlement we ever had.

54:33.271 --> 54:35.431
Could've been the biggest
if we had you there with us.

54:35.511 --> 54:37.551
I'm sure you and Peter
are doing just fine.

54:37.631 --> 54:38.912
We are, but...

54:39.032 --> 54:41.192
the office hasn't been
the same without you.

54:41.272 --> 54:42.432
Thank you.

54:42.512 --> 54:45.833
We'd love to take you to lunch and
chat a little more about that?

54:46.473 --> 54:48.074
Let me think about that.

54:48.154 --> 54:50.154
I'll take that as a yes.

54:50.434 --> 54:51.874
It's good to see you again, Paige.

54:51.954 --> 54:54.315
- You too.
- It's been too long.

54:54.395 --> 54:56.395
I couldn't agree more.

55:02.437 --> 55:05.237
Look at that. You see that?
You see what I mean?

55:05.757 --> 55:07.757
He's so weird.

55:08.278 --> 55:11.158
- Maybe he doesn't like parties.
- Then why come?

55:11.238 --> 55:14.559
He'll be gone soon enough.
Just steer clear of him till then.

55:16.599 --> 55:18.599
Come on! I need a turn!

55:20.640 --> 55:22.640
I got it!

55:29.882 --> 55:31.882
What's he doing now?

55:33.243 --> 55:35.243
Is he playing fetch
with that little kid?

55:35.643 --> 55:37.643
Yeah.

56:03.649 --> 56:05.649
Oh my God!

56:07.730 --> 56:09.730
Caroline!

56:09.971 --> 56:12.411
She fell! She fell! Help!

56:17.012 --> 56:18.572
- She's out.
- It's OK.

56:18.692 --> 56:20.573
Mommy has you.
I have you.

56:20.693 --> 56:23.453
- It's OK. It's fine.
- What happened?

56:26.574 --> 56:29.214
I don't know. I heard a splash.

56:29.655 --> 56:31.015
Thank God you did.

56:31.095 --> 56:33.255
I don't want to imagine
what would've happened if you hadn't.

56:33.375 --> 56:35.816
Yeah. Good work, Brandon. I...

56:36.296 --> 56:38.296
should go check on them.

56:38.536 --> 56:40.537
Do you wanna go home
and get dried up?

56:40.657 --> 56:42.657
OK.

56:52.939 --> 56:55.980
Brandon! What the hell was that?
That kid could've died!

56:56.100 --> 56:57.580
What do you mean? I saved her life.

56:57.660 --> 57:00.021
You threw that ball into the pool
on purpose. We saw you.

57:00.461 --> 57:02.581
Well, you saw wrong.
It was an accident.

57:03.862 --> 57:06.662
You must be Kara.
You're the one that liked my photo.

57:07.582 --> 57:10.543
I didn't mean to.
It was a slip of the finger.

57:10.623 --> 57:13.544
We were just trying to get
a better understanding of...

57:14.024 --> 57:16.024
of who you really are.

57:16.224 --> 57:19.305
Well, I hope you found whatever
it was you were looking for.

57:21.665 --> 57:24.306
Could you please say goodbye
to everyone for me?

57:24.386 --> 57:25.466
I need to get changed,

57:25.546 --> 57:28.507
and then there's an experiment back at
the lab that I really need to finish.

57:35.988 --> 57:39.069
You were right. There's something
seriously off about that guy.

57:39.709 --> 57:41.709
Brandon's gonna be
at the lab, right?

57:42.270 --> 57:45.150
And my parents are gonna be here for
at least another hour.

57:45.230 --> 57:47.121
Which means?

57:47.271 --> 57:49.551
I think it's about time that you and I

57:49.631 --> 57:52.472
find out a little bit more
about our new local hero.

58:00.833 --> 58:02.484
Anything?

58:02.634 --> 58:06.075
No. Just that he's kind
of an OCD neat freak.

58:14.036 --> 58:17.517
Oh God! It's like he went shopping
and just said to the salesperson:

58:17.597 --> 58:21.358
"I'll just get what the mannequin's
wearing in every color you have."

58:22.638 --> 58:23.718
He sure made himself at home

58:23.798 --> 58:26.439
for someone who's only supposed
to be here for a couple of weeks.

58:26.919 --> 58:28.919
Yeah.

58:29.439 --> 58:31.439
Yep!

58:40.082 --> 58:42.082
OK...

58:42.242 --> 58:45.723
This doesn't make any sense.
It says it's for his eighth birthday,

58:46.523 --> 58:48.843
but the card was printed in 2012.

58:49.804 --> 58:51.804
- That's really weird.
- That's really weird.

59:06.407 --> 59:08.407
They're here. Let's go!

59:18.249 --> 59:21.450
- I'm so glad you were free for lunch.
- Well, thank you for the invite.

59:21.530 --> 59:23.170
It feels good to be out.

59:23.250 --> 59:25.771
Everybody wanted me
to pass along their hellos

59:25.851 --> 59:27.251
and tell you that they miss you.

59:27.331 --> 59:29.022
That's nice to hear.

59:29.172 --> 59:32.492
And we sure could use
your litigation skills right now.

59:32.572 --> 59:35.773
We got an overload of cases,
and everybody's already slammed.

59:36.973 --> 59:38.614
We can make it easy on you.

59:38.694 --> 59:42.574
Slow transition back,
limited case load, pay raise.

59:43.175 --> 59:45.815
- Name your terms.
- Oh my gosh!

59:47.255 --> 59:50.456
- I don't know what to say.
- Say you'll think about it.

59:50.536 --> 59:54.137
Paige! It is so good to see you!
It's been so long!

59:54.257 --> 59:56.857
I've been meaning to call
you to see how you're doing.

59:56.977 --> 59:59.538
Joel and I are just so,
so sorry about Zach.

59:59.618 --> 01:00:02.219
He was such a good kid.
How you holding up?

01:00:02.339 --> 01:00:05.099
I'm fine.
We're just in a business meeting.

01:00:05.499 --> 01:00:07.540
Seth still talks
about Zach all the time.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.380
He really misses him.
All the kids do.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.500
An overdose, of all things?

01:00:12.661 --> 01:00:14.341
Never in a million years
would I have guessed

01:00:14.421 --> 01:00:16.141
that Zach would be
the kind of kid to do drugs.

01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:18.062
- Stop talking.
- Did you find out what happened?

01:00:18.142 --> 01:00:21.222
There's been so many rumors.
Not like in a gossipy way, but...

01:00:21.342 --> 01:00:23.223
- Stop talking.
- What was that?

01:00:23.303 --> 01:00:25.743
I said shut up and leave me alone.

01:00:35.345 --> 01:00:36.506
Colin, I'm sorry.

01:00:36.586 --> 01:00:40.106
I thought I was ready for this,
but I'm not.

01:00:40.826 --> 01:00:42.826
I'm just not ready.

01:01:50.481 --> 01:01:52.091
Brandon!

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:54.682
- Addie! I didn't know you were home.
- What the hell are you doing in here?

01:01:55.282 --> 01:01:58.963
My calculator died on me.
I figured Zach might have had one.

01:01:59.363 --> 01:02:01.803
I didn't think anybody
would mind if I borrowed it.

01:02:01.883 --> 01:02:03.883
You thought wrong.

01:02:06.724 --> 01:02:09.125
Why are you just
staring at me like that?

01:02:09.925 --> 01:02:11.965
It's so freakin' weird!

01:02:27.969 --> 01:02:29.969
Stay out of this room.

01:02:45.572 --> 01:02:47.973
- Can I just talk to you for a second?
- No, not now, Addie.

01:02:48.053 --> 01:02:50.853
OK, no I know,
but it's kind of really important.

01:02:51.293 --> 01:02:54.094
I caught Brandon snooping
around in Zach's room.

01:02:54.934 --> 01:02:56.895
Mom!
Do you hear me?

01:02:57.015 --> 01:02:59.375
Could I get minute of peace, please!

01:03:18.379 --> 01:03:20.379
Do you have a second, Paige?

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.500
Sure.

01:03:28.181 --> 01:03:30.181
I just wanted to let you know

01:03:31.262 --> 01:03:34.662
that Addie found me in Zach's room
earlier, and she was really mad.

01:03:36.223 --> 01:03:38.783
It was just for a second.
I had to borrow a calculator.

01:03:39.543 --> 01:03:41.543
I'm sorry.
I know I should've asked first.

01:03:43.624 --> 01:03:45.624
You should've asked.

01:03:48.105 --> 01:03:50.106
But that's not why
Addie's really angry.

01:03:51.106 --> 01:03:53.106
She just misses her brother.

01:03:53.986 --> 01:03:55.986
We all do.

01:04:01.868 --> 01:04:03.868
What's going on?

01:04:04.028 --> 01:04:05.919
It's Brandon.

01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:08.069
OK. What about him?

01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:11.870
I caught him snooping around
in Zach's room.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:14.750
And Mom didn't even care.

01:04:15.671 --> 01:04:18.231
Well, that's not OK.
What was he doing in there?

01:04:18.311 --> 01:04:20.272
I don't know. He said he was looking
for some stupid calcula...

01:04:20.352 --> 01:04:24.633
It wasn't what he said, it was
the way that he said it. It just...

01:04:25.713 --> 01:04:27.993
I just don't understand
why Mom thinks he's so great.

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:31.754
He's always staring at us with
that creepy blank stare.

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.234
And what about the barbecue?
What the hell was that?

01:04:33.315 --> 01:04:36.035
Was he just gonna let
that little kid fall in and drown?

01:04:37.195 --> 01:04:40.876
- Wait, what are you talking about?
- Kara and I watched from the window.

01:04:41.956 --> 01:04:43.557
He pushed the ball into the pool,

01:04:43.637 --> 01:04:46.557
knowing that that little kid
was gonna chase after it and fall in.

01:04:49.078 --> 01:04:51.198
- That's a serious accusation.
- I know what I saw.

01:04:51.278 --> 01:04:53.278
You can ask Kara
if you don't believe me.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.840
Well, I think it's time
for Brandon to move on.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.521
Yes. Thank you.

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:10.322
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:05:11.522 --> 01:05:13.522
You're home early.

01:05:14.123 --> 01:05:16.123
I have some good news...

01:05:17.044 --> 01:05:19.044
And some more good news.

01:05:21.124 --> 01:05:23.124
Which would you like to hear first?

01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:26.205
Let's start with the good news!

01:05:27.286 --> 01:05:30.246
Excellent choice!
We got the Energy account.

01:05:30.646 --> 01:05:32.847
What? That's amazing!

01:05:32.927 --> 01:05:35.527
That's great news, Nathan!
Congratulations!

01:05:35.607 --> 01:05:37.607
Thank you.

01:05:38.448 --> 01:05:41.969
- What's the other good news?
- You remember Robert?

01:05:42.529 --> 01:05:47.290
The account exec at the agency who owns
those two apartments in the Heights?

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:48.370
Yeah.

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:51.211
One of his apartments
has become vacant,

01:05:52.371 --> 01:05:54.451
And the official showing is tomorrow,

01:05:54.571 --> 01:05:59.412
but I talked him into letting Brandon
take a sneak peek tonight.

01:06:00.332 --> 01:06:03.413
Why would he wanna go and look at an
apartment so far away from campus?

01:06:04.813 --> 01:06:07.814
- I'd love to see it.
- Brandon, you don't have to say that.

01:06:07.894 --> 01:06:11.255
No, really! I think it's a great idea.

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:13.935
Really.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.696
Nathan, thank you so much
for thinking of me.

01:06:16.776 --> 01:06:18.776
Of course.

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.657
You know what?
Just let me grab my keys,

01:06:21.737 --> 01:06:24.257
and I'll be right back to get
the address from you, OK?

01:06:24.818 --> 01:06:26.818
OK, sure!

01:06:34.059 --> 01:06:36.059
Paige...

01:06:46.382 --> 01:06:48.823
He was only supposed
to be here a week or two.

01:06:48.903 --> 01:06:52.183
The Heights, Nathan? It's gonna
take him 45 minutes to get to class.

01:06:52.263 --> 01:06:53.944
But he'll have his own place.

01:06:54.024 --> 01:06:56.224
He can have friends over,
host dinner parties, I don't know.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:58.865
- How much is the rent?
- $1,250.

01:06:58.945 --> 01:07:00.945
He can't afford that!

01:07:01.985 --> 01:07:05.386
He might be able to extend his budget
if it means having a place of his own,

01:07:05.466 --> 01:07:07.666
having some privacy. I don't know.

01:07:08.187 --> 01:07:09.827
It's not like he's a member
of our family!

01:07:09.907 --> 01:07:11.787
He's not even a friend.
He's our tenant!

01:07:11.867 --> 01:07:13.867
Just keep your voice down!
He might hear you!

01:07:16.188 --> 01:07:20.269
I think that you need to stop worrying
so much about Brandon's feelings,

01:07:21.269 --> 01:07:23.470
and think about Addie's and mine.

01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:25.950
That's not fair.

01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:28.991
I don't want to fight about this, OK?

01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:33.722
This is our home.

01:07:33.872 --> 01:07:36.632
It's just time for
Brandon to move on,

01:07:38.153 --> 01:07:42.394
so that we can get back to being a
family together, just the three of us.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.121
The whole place is completely wired
with fiber-optic internet and cable,

01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:22.122
a fob entry system
with security cameras.

01:08:22.242 --> 01:08:28.002
It's a gas fireplace, in-suite laundry,
and I guess that's about it.

01:08:28.883 --> 01:08:30.883
So, do you have any questions?

01:08:31.964 --> 01:08:34.604
It's perfect!
How soon can I move in?

01:08:34.724 --> 01:08:37.484
I'll get you to fill out
an application first.

01:08:37.564 --> 01:08:41.086
Then, if everything checks out, you
could move in at the end of next week.

01:08:42.966 --> 01:08:46.207
First and last month's rent
are due on the day you move in,

01:08:46.287 --> 01:08:48.607
and as for references, we can...

01:08:48.687 --> 01:08:50.687
Shoot!

01:08:51.648 --> 01:08:55.049
I accidentally put my driver's license
number in the social-security part.

01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:57.368
Do you happen to have
another application?

01:08:57.448 --> 01:09:01.010
No problem. I have extra copies
in my car. I'll be right back.

01:09:22.774 --> 01:09:25.895
...first in 10, in the closing minutes
of the 4th quarter.

01:09:27.654 --> 01:09:30.136
Note the offense shifts to the right
side for this play.

01:09:30.216 --> 01:09:31.216
The ball is snapped.

01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:33.296
Hello?

01:09:33.657 --> 01:09:35.657
Hi, Robert.
How'd it go?

01:09:38.578 --> 01:09:41.698
What? How did...
How did they all just go off?

01:09:46.658 --> 01:09:49.580
Two months?
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:09:53.621 --> 01:09:55.941
No, look, I understand.

01:09:57.061 --> 01:09:59.142
Let me know
if there's anything I can do.

01:10:02.503 --> 01:10:04.863
Yeah. OK. I'll see you then.

01:10:06.183 --> 01:10:08.183
Bye!

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.987
Hi, Brandon!

01:10:28.348 --> 01:10:30.348
Nathan!

01:10:31.509 --> 01:10:33.509
I'm surprised
you're still up!

01:10:33.989 --> 01:10:36.109
I wanted to have
a word with you in private.

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.550
I'll just get right to the point.

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:43.471
I want you to know how much
we've all enjoyed having you here.

01:10:45.311 --> 01:10:48.472
But... it's time for you to move on.

01:10:49.872 --> 01:10:53.593
Well, I was really looking forward to
moving into Robert's apartment.

01:10:54.313 --> 01:10:56.314
It's such a shame
about the water damage.

01:10:56.634 --> 01:10:58.634
Yeah. It is a shame.

01:11:01.035 --> 01:11:03.395
But there are
plenty of other apartments out there.

01:11:04.555 --> 01:11:07.836
Sorry, Brandon.
It's been a tough year for us,

01:11:08.436 --> 01:11:10.597
and I think we have
a lot more healing to do.

01:11:11.077 --> 01:11:14.717
But to do that, we're gonna need
some time and some privacy.

01:11:15.158 --> 01:11:16.998
Well, I could start spending
more time on campus.

01:11:17.078 --> 01:11:19.038
I could stay in my room more, if...

01:11:19.118 --> 01:11:21.118
That's not what I'm saying.

01:11:21.479 --> 01:11:23.879
I'm happy to write you
a letter of recommendation,

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:29.000
but... you have until the end
of the week to find another place.

01:11:30.881 --> 01:11:32.881
And then you have to move out.

01:11:34.842 --> 01:11:36.842
How does Paige feel about this?

01:11:37.362 --> 01:11:39.683
I'm telling you
it's time for you to go.

01:11:44.084 --> 01:11:46.084
I see.

01:12:42.576 --> 01:12:44.656
I should've talked to you first.

01:12:45.176 --> 01:12:46.896
I already said I'm sorry.

01:12:46.977 --> 01:12:49.777
It'll be two weeks on Monday,
which is what we agreed to, isn't it?

01:12:54.378 --> 01:12:57.179
Addie has soccer practice after school.
You'll pick her up, right?

01:12:57.259 --> 01:12:59.259
Yeah.

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:54.150
Morning!

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:56.831
You're up early! Can I make you
something to eat?

01:13:56.911 --> 01:13:59.912
No, thank you. I grabbed a power bar
before my run.

01:14:00.352 --> 01:14:03.392
Besides, I have a couple of apartments
I want to check out before class.

01:14:04.833 --> 01:14:07.953
Brandon, I want you to know that it
wasn't my decision for you to move out.

01:14:10.994 --> 01:14:12.964
I know that.

01:14:13.114 --> 01:14:16.435
You've been so kind and
generous with me.

01:14:17.715 --> 01:14:19.715
But I'll be fine. I promise.

01:14:21.876 --> 01:14:23.957
Just in case you miss your lunch.

01:14:26.557 --> 01:14:27.717
What happened?

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.797
- What?
- On your neck.

01:14:31.678 --> 01:14:35.039
It's nothing. I must've been
bitten by a mosquito on my run.

01:14:35.439 --> 01:14:38.039
You have one on your hand too.
Looks like a bee sting.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.600
It's really no big deal.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.040
Thank you so much for the lunch.

01:14:45.521 --> 01:14:47.521
Of course.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:02.805
The forecast calls for occasional
spring showers this morning,

01:15:02.885 --> 01:15:06.965
followed by partial clearing this
afternoon. Today's high near 57Â°.

01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:09.846
Tonight more cloud
with an overnight low of 39Â°.

01:15:09.966 --> 01:15:14.247
More rain tomorrow, with the chance of
thunderstorms and a high of only 49Â°.

01:15:14.327 --> 01:15:18.128
With the winds out
of the northwest at 7 mph...

01:16:09.818 --> 01:16:11.899
Just pick it up.
She keeps calling.

01:16:12.259 --> 01:16:15.660
She only feels guilty because
she left me again at soccer practice.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.940
Blue team to ICU please.
Blue team, ICU.

01:16:25.262 --> 01:16:28.782
She has completely forgotten
about me since Brandon moved in.

01:16:29.983 --> 01:16:32.103
Have you found out anything
more about him?

01:16:32.783 --> 01:16:36.184
No. No. Literally nothing.
He's completely off the grid.

01:16:37.144 --> 01:16:39.425
Do you still have that family picture
of his in your phone?

01:16:40.465 --> 01:16:42.195
Yeah. Why?

01:16:42.345 --> 01:16:44.345
You could try a reverse-image search.

01:16:45.626 --> 01:16:48.826
OK. It's worth a shot!
I'll have to AirDrop it.

01:16:58.108 --> 01:17:00.549
Reverse image search
Drop image here

01:17:09.151 --> 01:17:11.151
Here we go. Here's something.

01:17:13.592 --> 01:17:16.352
It's from a small town
in Northern California.

01:17:18.873 --> 01:17:20.753
"The fire took the lives of Dr. Toth,

01:17:20.833 --> 01:17:22.793
his wife Naomi,
and their 6-year-old daughter.

01:17:22.914 --> 01:17:26.914
The only survivor was the
couple's 8-year-old son, Christopher."

01:17:28.475 --> 01:17:30.475
"Christopher"?

01:17:31.195 --> 01:17:33.476
"Christopher"?
Why would he change his name?

01:17:33.556 --> 01:17:35.356
And why would he lie
about how his parents died?

01:17:35.476 --> 01:17:37.797
I don't know. Everything about him is
so messed up.

01:17:39.117 --> 01:17:41.397
I'm gonna show this to my mom
before Brandon gets home.

01:17:46.158 --> 01:17:48.639
- I'll see you later.
- Bye!

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.480
Dr. Howley, please report to radiology.
Dr. Peter Howley...

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.560
- Mrs. Petrovic!
- Yes!

01:17:57.721 --> 01:17:58.921
Is he OK?

01:17:59.001 --> 01:18:01.241
I'm afraid your husband
sustained a serious head injury,

01:18:01.321 --> 01:18:03.122
and he's still in surgery.

01:18:03.202 --> 01:18:05.882
We also found multiple bee
stings all over his body.

01:18:05.962 --> 01:18:08.083
- Bee stings!
- I've never seen anything like it.

01:18:08.163 --> 01:18:11.203
I don't know how somebody gets
stung that many times while driving.

01:18:11.284 --> 01:18:14.724
And with his severe allergy,
that alone could've killed him.

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:17.725
He's extremely lucky to be alive.

01:18:19.205 --> 01:18:21.176
Thank you, Doctor.

01:18:21.326 --> 01:18:23.606
I will keep you updated, OK?

01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:45.170
Come on, Addie! Pick up!

01:18:56.213 --> 01:18:58.213
Mom!

01:18:59.934 --> 01:19:02.574
Mom? Are you home?

01:19:04.575 --> 01:19:06.575
God! You scared the hell out of me!

01:19:07.215 --> 01:19:09.656
What are you doing,
sitting here in the dark?

01:19:11.456 --> 01:19:13.456
Waiting for you.

01:19:25.659 --> 01:19:27.659
Addie?

01:19:28.339 --> 01:19:31.620
- That's close enough!
- Be careful! He's crazy!

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:33.831
Shut up!

01:19:33.981 --> 01:19:36.021
I'm so glad that
you could join us.

01:19:36.101 --> 01:19:37.941
It's too bad that Nathan
couldn't make it.

01:19:38.021 --> 01:19:41.182
- Did something happen to Dad?
- He was in an accident.

01:19:41.262 --> 01:19:43.503
- No!
- It's OK, Addie. He's gonna be OK.

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:47.223
He burned his whole family alive!
Mom, he's a sick freak!

01:19:47.303 --> 01:19:49.624
His name's not even Brandon!
It's Christopher!

01:19:49.704 --> 01:19:53.065
What difference does my name make?
It means nothing.

01:19:53.145 --> 01:19:54.905
Why are you doing this to us?

01:19:54.985 --> 01:19:56.985
Doing this to you?

01:19:59.106 --> 01:20:01.626
Why are you doing
this to me?

01:20:03.267 --> 01:20:05.307
I've been nothing
but the perfect son to you.

01:20:05.387 --> 01:20:08.788
I've been willing to do
anything to be a part of this family,

01:20:08.868 --> 01:20:10.788
and yet you still rejected me.

01:20:10.868 --> 01:20:13.549
- No. Nobody rejected you.
- She did!

01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:15.549
From the moment
that she laid eyes on me.

01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:18.150
And then she got Nathan
to turn on me too.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:22.071
My parents were monsters!
That's why I had to get rid of them.

01:20:23.671 --> 01:20:26.071
But I saw the way
that you were with Zach.

01:20:27.352 --> 01:20:29.832
- You were gonna be different.
- You knew Zach?

01:20:29.952 --> 01:20:33.153
Did you really think that
this was all just some... fluke?

01:20:34.753 --> 01:20:36.073
I've wanted what Zach had

01:20:36.153 --> 01:20:38.954
since the first time
I saw you drop him off at college,

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.034
when we were in freshman year.

01:20:41.274 --> 01:20:45.435
And you wouldn't stop
hugging and kissing him goodbye,

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:47.876
no matter how much
it embarrassed him.

01:20:47.956 --> 01:20:52.397
And nobody's ever loved me like that.
Not even close.

01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:56.558
But, see, Zach had everything,
and I had nothing.

01:20:56.638 --> 01:21:00.358
And it was not gonna change, so I just
had to take matters into my own hands.

01:21:01.239 --> 01:21:03.399
He never appreciated what he had.

01:21:04.319 --> 01:21:07.120
Not like I would have! And you...

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.680
Mom!

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.081
...ruined everything! You've...

01:21:11.561 --> 01:21:14.241
This is your fault!
This is why this is happening!

01:21:14.321 --> 01:21:15.962
- It's your fault!
- Please!

01:21:16.042 --> 01:21:18.282
I would've been a good brother,
if you would've just let me!

01:21:18.362 --> 01:21:20.362
Please put the lighter away!

01:21:20.603 --> 01:21:22.723
Brandon, I wanna help you.

01:21:23.883 --> 01:21:27.564
- No! You're just saying that.
- No!

01:21:27.964 --> 01:21:30.525
No! I care about you!

01:21:32.285 --> 01:21:34.285
We can get through this...

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.616
together.

01:21:37.766 --> 01:21:39.126
Put the lighter away.

01:21:39.206 --> 01:21:43.407
- Why should I believe you?
- Because... I understand you.

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:50.729
You were abused.
And that caused you to lash out.

01:21:51.769 --> 01:21:54.010
But you were just defending yourself.

01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:59.410
Exactly.

01:22:00.171 --> 01:22:04.052
So, that part of your life
is behind you now,

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:07.212
and we can start fresh.

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:14.494
Why would you help me
after everything I've done?

01:22:15.134 --> 01:22:17.134
We're family.

01:22:20.855 --> 01:22:22.855
We're family.

01:22:25.456 --> 01:22:27.817
It's OK. Come here.

01:22:39.659 --> 01:22:41.659
Addie, run!

01:22:51.221 --> 01:22:53.221
Mom!

01:22:55.982 --> 01:22:58.303
Brandon! Brandon, please!
Brandon, please!

01:23:01.463 --> 01:23:03.944
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this!

01:23:04.024 --> 01:23:06.024
Leave my daughter alone!

01:23:09.385 --> 01:23:11.385
Mom! Mom!

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:13.786
Brandon! No! Brandon!

01:23:15.306 --> 01:23:17.306
No!

01:23:21.268 --> 01:23:23.268
I loved you.

01:23:25.588 --> 01:23:27.588
- Mom!
- I loved you!

01:23:28.509 --> 01:23:30.509
No!

01:24:00.436 --> 01:24:02.996
THREE MONTHS LATER

01:24:07.037 --> 01:24:10.278
Let's go, Addie!
I have to be in court by 9:00.

01:24:10.598 --> 01:24:12.368
OK, OK!

01:24:12.518 --> 01:24:14.518
Have a great one.

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:17.199
See you later tonight.

01:24:17.279 --> 01:24:19.480
- Knock 'em dead, beautiful.
- Thank you!

01:24:31.242 --> 01:24:33.242
Mom, let's go!

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:45.005
THICKER THAN WATER
