MAC: Yeah.

00:04.492 --> 00:06.585
I'd like you to meet
our new defense attorney.

00:06.761 --> 00:09.195
Billie Young,
Mac Robinson, our court clerk.

00:09.364 --> 00:11.059
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- Same here.

00:11.232 --> 00:13.700
- Hey, nice grip.
BILLIE: Well, thanks.

00:13.868 --> 00:16.302
You see, I wrestle professionally
on the weekends.

00:16.471 --> 00:18.200
- The Bayonne Bruiser?
- Oh, yeah.

00:18.373 --> 00:20.739
I caught you at the Gardens
a couple of times.

You're kidding, aren't you?

00:26.548 --> 00:29.108
Yeah, we're just funning, Bull.

00:29.284 --> 00:31.548
And this is her assistant, Brad Tallman.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.154
- Hi.
- Hi, what's happening?

00:36.691 --> 00:38.283
I have no idea.

00:39.394 --> 00:41.521
Come on, let's sit over here.

00:42.030 --> 00:44.021
Bull, will you crack
these chestnuts for me?

00:44.199 --> 00:48.602
Well, hello, hello, hello.
Dan Fielding, assistant district attorney.

00:48.770 --> 00:50.237
- Billie Young.
DAN: Nice to meet you.

00:50.405 --> 00:52.202
- My pleasure.
- That could be arranged.

00:53.541 --> 00:55.406
I'm Brad Tallman,
Miss Young's assistant.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.841
- Yeah, hi.
- Uh, have you been in criminal court long?

00:58.013 --> 00:59.037
Seven years.

00:59.214 --> 01:00.841
Wow. Perhaps you could give
me some advice?

01:01.016 --> 01:04.315
Certainly. Don't wear that tie in court.
Listen, it's your first night.

01:04.486 --> 01:06.545
How about a little welcome drink
after work?

01:06.721 --> 01:08.120
Sounds like fun. It's a date.

01:10.225 --> 01:11.920
Oh, great.

01:12.894 --> 01:13.918
Uh, I'll see you later.

01:16.231 --> 01:17.596
This could be hot.

01:17.766 --> 01:20.997
I'll try and keep her
from asking around about you.

01:23.171 --> 01:26.766
Look at this.
"Man with eight arms to wed."

01:26.941 --> 01:28.238
Selma, that's disgusting.

01:28.410 --> 01:31.538
Those trashy tabloids
are filled with nothing but gossip and lies...

01:31.713 --> 01:35.012
...and the sensationalism
of human tragedy.

01:35.316 --> 01:37.750
Tux fits nice, though, don't it?

01:38.186 --> 01:41.519
Oh, Your Honor. I'd like you to meet
Miss Billie Young of legal aid...

01:41.689 --> 01:43.589
...and her assistant, Brad Tallman.

01:43.758 --> 01:45.658
Miss Selma Hacker,
Judge Harold T. Stone.

01:45.827 --> 01:47.522
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:47.695 --> 01:50.027
- Nice to meet you. Brad Tallman.
- Nice to meet you.

[LAUGHING]

01:55.904 --> 01:57.838
I guess I told it wrong.

01:58.006 --> 02:00.338
How about a game of pool
before we start work, huh?

02:00.508 --> 02:02.476
- I'm pretty good.
- Don't let that stop you.

02:02.911 --> 02:06.677
Well, I have this silly superstition
about hustling the judge before a session.

02:06.848 --> 02:08.372
Good policy. How about after?

02:08.817 --> 02:11.547
Oh, I'm afraid I can't.
I'm having drinks with Dan.

02:12.554 --> 02:14.317
Dan?

02:15.957 --> 02:19.893
- Dan Fielding, our DA?
- Uh-huh.

You know,
this is my first trip outside Ohio.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.344
No.

03:20.522 --> 03:23.719
Yeah, really. Hey, how about you and me
doing the town tonight?

03:23.892 --> 03:25.382
- Doing the town?
- Yeah.

The Empire State Building,
a trip on the Staten Island Ferry...

with a hot dog at Nathan's.

Third-degree burglary.

He stole a cat.

04:06.201 --> 04:08.465
Just getting started in the business,
Mr. Seaver?

04:09.070 --> 04:11.561
I'm no criminal, Your Honor.
That cat belongs to me.

04:11.739 --> 04:16.005
- And believe me, she's more than just a cat.
- More than just a cat?

04:16.177 --> 04:20.045
That's true, Your Honor.

04:20.214 --> 04:22.649
...the trademark

04:22.817 --> 04:24.808
Yeah, Ruffles,
I see him on TV all the time.

04:24.986 --> 04:28.547
That's the cat with those neat,
little break-dance number, isn't he?

04:28.723 --> 04:31.988
- Uh, the cat can't dance.
- What are you talking about? He's terrific.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.321
That's special effects. It costs a fortune.

- You are?
- Roger Blair, chief counsel for Kitty Kitty.

04:37.565 --> 04:39.157
Actually, the cat is quite stupid.

04:39.334 --> 04:42.770
We have to use a stand-in for practically
everything except the close-ups.

04:42.937 --> 04:43.961
That's a lie.

04:44.138 --> 04:47.437
Velma's smart as a whip. She used to
make toast for me in the mornings.

04:47.609 --> 04:50.169
She'd push the lever down
with her little paw.

04:50.712 --> 04:54.170
That's quite impressive, Mr. Seaver,
but just for the record, who is Velma?

04:54.349 --> 04:56.840
Uh, Your Honor, Velma is Ruffles.

04:57.885 --> 04:59.079
I don't understand.

04:59.254 --> 05:02.052
Well, one night after dinner,
I went for a walk, Your Honor.

05:02.223 --> 05:03.781
I was looking for some string.

05:03.958 --> 05:06.825
It was going to be a surprise
for Velma's birthday.

05:06.995 --> 05:08.053
She loved surprises.

05:08.229 --> 05:12.393
To summarize, Your Honor,
when he returned, the cat had disappeared.

05:12.734 --> 05:14.531
Well, I left the bedroom window open.

05:14.702 --> 05:15.862
She was gone.

05:16.304 --> 05:18.738
No note, nothing.

05:18.906 --> 05:20.840
I was devastated.

05:21.009 --> 05:23.477

everything reminded me of her.

through the screen...

05:40.228 --> 05:41.786
...pimping cat food.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.231
How could you tell it was Velma?

05:46.834 --> 05:50.634
Could you forget the look of someone
you slept with for six years?

05:51.372 --> 05:53.465
It can be done.

05:55.943 --> 05:58.741
Uh, Mr. Seaver, do you have any proof
you once owned this animal?

05:58.913 --> 06:03.213
Uh, Your Honor, Mr. Seaver had this photo
taken of Velma a few Christmases ago.

06:03.584 --> 06:04.881
- Oh. Yeah.
- Very nice.

06:05.053 --> 06:07.283
Well, I sewed the Santa outfit myself.

06:07.455 --> 06:09.218
Look at the cute little white beard.

06:09.390 --> 06:11.051
It's cotton balls.

Your Honor, the state's collective heart
goes out to Mr. Seaver...

06:15.129 --> 06:19.088
...but fact is, the Kitty Kitty Cat Company
has proof of ownership of the animal.

06:19.267 --> 06:21.428
We found her, Your Honor,
in an animal shelter.

06:21.602 --> 06:23.866
If it wasn't for us,
she would've been destroyed.

06:24.038 --> 06:25.733
That's what you're doing to her now.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.375
When I found Velma,
she was an emotional cripple.

Sudden fame, instant money.
We've seen it a thousand times...

06:31.946 --> 06:35.382
...haven't we, Mr. Blair?
- It killed Morris.

06:37.518 --> 06:40.419
- Where is the cat now?
- Apparently, in Mr. Seaver's possession.

06:40.588 --> 06:42.453
The police traced the burglary to him...

06:42.623 --> 06:46.059
...but there was no sign
of the purloined feline.

06:46.227 --> 06:49.560
He has no friends, no family and no job,
Your Honor.

06:49.731 --> 06:51.790
Velma's companionship
is his very lifesblood.

06:51.966 --> 06:55.367
You take that away,
and you might as well put him to sleep.

Figure of speech.

07:04.645 --> 07:08.877
You don't seem to understand, counselor,
we're talking about more than a cat here.

07:09.050 --> 07:10.813
Ruffles is a trademark.

07:11.252 --> 07:14.585
Since she's joined the firm,
sales have gone up 130 percent.

07:14.756 --> 07:17.190
And we're not just talking cat food,
Your Honor.

07:17.358 --> 07:19.189
We are talking merchandising.

Greeting cards, calendars, posters...

07:22.463 --> 07:24.294
Lunch boxes.

07:30.438 --> 07:32.372
It was a gift.

07:34.108 --> 07:37.202
Mr. Blair, would Kitty Kitty
consider dropping the charges...

07:37.378 --> 07:39.972
...if, uh, Ruffles nÃ©e Velma, were returned?

07:40.148 --> 07:41.911
- We would, Your Honor.
- No way.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.677
- Mr. Seaver...
- And, uh, my company has authorized me...

07:44.852 --> 07:48.049
...to pay Mr. Seaver a finder's fee,
if you will, of $ 1000.

07:48.222 --> 07:50.554
That seems a fair and reasonable offer,
Mr. Seaver.

07:52.059 --> 07:53.117
Velma's my friend.

07:53.294 --> 07:56.457
Take the money,
go buy yourself a box full of friends.

07:57.432 --> 08:01.061
- We are prepared to offer you $2500.
- Money is not the issue here, Your Honor.

08:01.235 --> 08:03.795
- Five-thousand.
- We're talking about a man's devotion.

- Seventy-five hundred.
- His love for another living creature.

08:06.741 --> 08:08.902
- Ten-thousand dollars.
- No.

08:09.076 --> 08:10.668
You can't put a price on love.

08:11.446 --> 08:14.415
He must be from out of town.

in Mr. Seaver's possession.

08:21.823 --> 08:23.120
- No.
- It's all right, Miles.

08:28.896 --> 08:32.024
All right, you were entitled to that one.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.599
Explanation, Miss Young.

08:33.768 --> 08:37.635
Your Honor, when I interviewed my client,
he told me where he had hidden the cat...

08:37.804 --> 08:40.365
...and for humane reasons,
I had someone pick her up...

08:40.541 --> 08:43.236
...and put her in a private kennel
at my own expense.

08:43.678 --> 08:46.442
Tell us where that kennel is, Miss Young.

08:48.983 --> 08:51.349
With all due respect, sir...

08:52.253 --> 08:53.720
...I don't think I can.

08:55.089 --> 08:56.920
All right, there's a two "ooh" limit.

08:57.091 --> 08:59.321
That's your last one.

08:59.494 --> 09:03.055
- I stand on the attorney-client privilege.
- You stand on thin ice, counselor.

09:03.231 --> 09:07.133
You know that privilege ended as soon as
you revealed that information in open court.

09:07.301 --> 09:12.000
Sir, I cannot let this feeble, wretched,
pathetic, little man down.

09:12.173 --> 09:13.731
Thank you.

Would the counsels seat their clients,
then join me at the bench...

What if she's thrown in jail?

09:33.427 --> 09:36.692
- Then you'll be in charge.
- That's what I thought.

09:37.131 --> 09:39.861
I think I'll be throwing up now.

09:42.270 --> 09:45.137
- What are you doing, Miss Young?
- The right thing, Your Honor.

09:45.306 --> 09:48.742
Kitty Kitty might be legally right,
but my client is not wrong.

09:48.910 --> 09:52.038
He's just fallen between
the cracks of the system.

09:52.213 --> 09:55.182
Looks like he's fallen between
the cracks of the sidewalk too.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.610
Miss Young,
either you tell us where that animal is...

10:00.788 --> 10:04.485
...or the law will compel me
to find you in contempt of this court.

10:04.659 --> 10:06.684
I understand the consequences,
Your Honor.

10:06.861 --> 10:10.695
What, you're gonna kill off our date
for some geek who's in love with his furball?

10:14.168 --> 10:16.193
I find that a little bit insensitive.

10:16.370 --> 10:18.463
I'll say it is.

10:19.473 --> 10:22.601
I believe she was referring to you,
Mr. Prosecutor.

10:22.777 --> 10:25.007
- Oh, I don't think so, sir.
- Your Honor.

10:25.179 --> 10:28.307
Miss Young,
I'll give you one more chance.

10:28.482 --> 10:29.540
Where is the cat?

10:32.219 --> 10:33.413
Okay, just kidding.

10:33.588 --> 10:36.056
One more chance.

10:36.290 --> 10:38.315
Where is the cat?

10:40.027 --> 10:41.585
Securely locked away, Your Honor.

10:42.496 --> 10:45.294
Then you two
will have something in common.

10:47.134 --> 10:50.433
Miss Young, this court finds you
in contempt and orders you confined...

10:50.605 --> 10:54.302
...until such time as you are willing
to surrender Ruffles to his rightful...

10:54.475 --> 10:55.499
Her.

10:55.676 --> 10:57.837
Her rightful owner.

11:02.316 --> 11:05.752
- I'm sorry, I hate to do this.
- It's okay, Selma, I understand.

11:05.920 --> 11:09.083
The matron who does the strip search
is a friend of mine.

11:09.256 --> 11:12.282
I'll put in a good word for you.

11:13.327 --> 11:17.263
- Well, what now, Your Honor?
- We move along and proceed as best we can.

11:17.431 --> 11:20.889
- Where's Mr. Tallman?
- Right here, Your Honor.

11:43.991 --> 11:46.152
- Hey, my case was supposed to be next.
- Okay.

11:46.327 --> 11:47.385
Says who?

11:48.596 --> 11:51.360
I'm much more dangerous than he is.

11:51.832 --> 11:54.027
Right, you are.

What a nerd.

11:55.870 --> 11:57.770
Oh, come on, Dan,
he's just over his head.

That's why legal aid only sends

- He's young, he's inexperienced.
- He just stapled his tie to the table.
