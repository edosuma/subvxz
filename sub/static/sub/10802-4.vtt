WEBVTT

00:07.600 --> 00:10.138
Captain,
I have identified the signal.

00:10.228 --> 00:12.267
It is from the USS Jenolen,

00:12.355 --> 00:16.435
a Federation transport ship
reported missing 75 years ago.

00:16.526 --> 00:18.851
Code One Alpha Zero,
ship in distress.

00:18.945 --> 00:22.694
- Take us out of warp. All stop.
- Aye, sir.

00:24.951 --> 00:26.232
Report.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.661
We have entered
a massive gravitational field.

00:30.999 --> 00:34.913
There are no stars or stellar bodies
listed on our charts.

00:35.003 --> 00:40.164
However, sensors indicate
a strong gravitational source here.

00:40.258 --> 00:43.010
Can you localize the source
of the field?

00:46.056 --> 00:47.764
Sensors?

00:47.849 --> 00:49.926
I am having difficulty scanning it.

00:50.018 --> 00:53.850
It appears to be
200 million kilometers in diameter.

00:54.231 --> 00:56.900
That's as large as the Earth's orbit.

00:58.110 --> 01:00.268
Why didn't we detect this before?

01:00.362 --> 01:05.190
The object's enormous mass
causes gravimetric interference.

01:05.284 --> 01:09.234
That might have prevented
our sensors detecting it.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.954
Mr. Data.

01:13.084 --> 01:15.705
Could this be a Dyson Sphere?

01:15.795 --> 01:19.330
The object does fit the parameters
of Dyson's theory.

01:19.423 --> 01:21.048
A Dyson Sphere?

01:21.134 --> 01:25.428
It's an old theory. I'm not surprised
you haven't heard of it.

01:25.513 --> 01:30.009
In the 20th century, a physicist,
Freeman Dyson, postulated the theory

01:30.101 --> 01:34.181
that an enormous hollow sphere
could be constructed around a star.

01:34.856 --> 01:39.518
This would harness
all the radiant energy of that star.

01:39.611 --> 01:42.481
Any population living on the interior

01:42.572 --> 01:46.321
would have virtually
inexhaustible sources of power.

01:46.409 --> 01:48.568
Are you saying people live there?

01:48.662 --> 01:51.069
Possibly a great number of people.

01:51.164 --> 01:54.368
The interior surface of the sphere
is the equivalent

01:54.459 --> 01:57.793
of more than 250 million
Class-M planets.

01:57.879 --> 01:59.753
Sir, I have located the signal.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.413
It is coming
from the northern hemisphere.

02:02.509 --> 02:05.712
Put us into synchronous
orbit above that position.

02:05.804 --> 02:07.464
Aye, sir.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.577 --> 02:30.369
I have located the Jenolen.

02:30.454 --> 02:33.325
It is impacted on the surface.

02:33.416 --> 02:34.875
Magnify.

02:34.959 --> 02:39.253
There are no life signs.
There are small power emanations.

02:39.338 --> 02:42.838
Life support is still functioning
on minimal levels.

02:42.925 --> 02:46.092
Riker to Engineering.
Geordi, transporter room three.

02:46.179 --> 02:47.638
Mr. Worf.

03:02.279 --> 03:03.939
This air's pretty stale.

03:04.030 --> 03:06.522
Life support is barely operating.

03:06.616 --> 03:09.404
See if you can increase
the oxygen level.

03:14.583 --> 03:18.581
Commander,
the transporter is still on line.

03:18.670 --> 03:21.874
It's being fed power
from the auxiliary systems.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.919
The rematerialisation subroutine
has been disabled.

03:26.011 --> 03:27.803
That's not all.

03:27.888 --> 03:31.257
The phase inducers
are connected to the emitter array.

03:31.350 --> 03:33.722
The override is completely gone.

03:33.811 --> 03:36.812
The pattern buffer is locked
into a continuous cycle.

03:36.897 --> 03:39.139
This doesn't make any sense.

03:39.233 --> 03:41.938
Locking the unit
into a diagnostic mode

03:42.028 --> 03:45.029
just sends matter array
through the pattern buffer.

03:45.114 --> 03:47.688
There's a pattern in the buffer.

03:49.327 --> 03:51.201
It's completely intact.

03:51.496 --> 03:55.410
There's less than
0.003 percent signal degradation.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.958
How is that possible?

03:57.043 --> 04:00.792
I've never seen a transporter
jury-rigged like this.

04:01.881 --> 04:06.923
Could someone survive inside
a transporter buffer for 75 years?

04:07.762 --> 04:10.170
I know a way to find out.

04:52.641 --> 04:55.808
Space, the final frontier.

04:57.396 --> 05:00.765
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

05:01.442 --> 05:05.772
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

05:06.906 --> 05:10.275
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

05:11.411 --> 05:14.993
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.804
Thank you, lad.

06:18.271 --> 06:20.263
We've got to get Franklin out.

06:20.356 --> 06:24.769
- Someone else is in there?
- Franklin. We went in together.

06:27.238 --> 06:31.106
Something's wrong.
One of the inducers has failed.

06:31.910 --> 06:34.579
Boost the gain
on the matter stream.

06:35.413 --> 06:38.747
Come on, Franklin.
I know you're in there.

06:44.631 --> 06:49.008
It's no use.
His pattern's degraded 53 percent.

06:50.512 --> 06:52.505
He's gone.

06:52.597 --> 06:55.385
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

06:56.226 --> 06:58.385
He was a good lad.

06:59.688 --> 07:04.516
I'm Cmdr Riker, Starship
Enterprise. Lt Cmdr La Forge.

07:05.486 --> 07:08.522
The Enterprise.
I should have known.

07:09.365 --> 07:14.572
I bet Jim Kirk himself hauled the old
girl out of mothballs to look for me.

07:14.662 --> 07:16.405
Capt Montgomery Scott.

07:16.497 --> 07:19.533
Tell me,
how long have I been missing?

07:19.625 --> 07:21.950
- Well...
- Sir.

07:22.378 --> 07:24.584
I have restored life support.

07:24.672 --> 07:27.875
The oxygen levels
will return to normal shortly.

07:28.718 --> 07:32.217
- Capt Scott, Lt Worf.
- Lieutenant?

07:33.056 --> 07:34.301
Yes.

07:34.390 --> 07:37.475
Captain, there are things
we should talk about.

07:51.783 --> 07:54.654
We should get you to sickbay.
Dr Crusher...

07:54.744 --> 07:57.366
You've changed the resonator array.

07:57.455 --> 08:00.706
Geordi, our guest
will have a lot of questions.

08:00.792 --> 08:03.497
Not to worry. I'll take care of him.

08:09.009 --> 08:11.761
What have you done
with the duotronic enhancers?

08:11.845 --> 08:15.760
Those were replaced
with isolinear chips 40 years ago.

08:15.849 --> 08:19.514
It's a lot more efficient.
That's an EPS power tap.

08:22.273 --> 08:25.523
So you were on your way
to the Norpin Colony

08:25.609 --> 08:28.361
when you experienced
warp-engine failure?

08:28.445 --> 08:33.404
That's right. We had an overload in
one of the plasma-transfer conduits.

08:33.491 --> 08:37.905
The Captain brought us out of warp.
We hit gravimetric interference.

08:37.996 --> 08:40.570
There it was, as big as life.

08:40.666 --> 08:44.664
- Is that a conduit interface?
- Yeah, it is.

08:44.754 --> 08:49.001
You were saying, as big as life.
You mean the Dyson Sphere?

08:49.092 --> 08:51.665
Aye, an actual Dyson Sphere.

08:51.761 --> 08:54.596
Can you imagine
the engineering skills

08:54.681 --> 08:57.219
needed to even design
such a structure?

08:57.308 --> 09:00.594
It's amazing. What happened
when you approached it?

09:00.687 --> 09:03.641
Well, we began our survey
of the surface.

09:03.732 --> 09:07.480
We were just completing
the initial orbital scan

09:07.569 --> 09:11.068
when our aft power coil
suddenly exploded.

09:11.156 --> 09:16.067
The ship got caught in the sphere's
gravity well and down we went.

09:16.161 --> 09:20.289
Franklin and I were the only ones
to survive the crash.

09:20.374 --> 09:22.034
Can I ask a question?

09:22.125 --> 09:27.084
What made you think of using
the transporter buffer to survive?

09:27.172 --> 09:31.918
Well, we didn't have enough supplies
to wait for the rescue,

09:32.010 --> 09:33.920
so we had to think of something.

09:34.013 --> 09:38.971
But locking it into a diagnostic
cycle so the pattern didn't degrade

09:39.059 --> 09:42.144
and cross-connecting it
with the phase inducers

09:42.229 --> 09:45.848
to provide a power source,
that's absolutely brilliant.

09:45.941 --> 09:49.441
I think
it was only 50 percent brilliant.

09:49.528 --> 09:51.936
Franklin deserved better.

09:54.116 --> 09:56.738
I think
you'll enjoy the 24th century.

09:56.828 --> 10:00.113
We've made incredible advances
these last 80 years.

10:00.206 --> 10:06.624
From what I've seen, you've got
a fine ship. A real beauty here.

10:06.713 --> 10:09.464
I must admit
to being a bit overwhelmed.

10:09.549 --> 10:11.791
Wait till you see the holodeck.

10:14.012 --> 10:16.764
You have a hairline fracture
of the humerus.

10:16.848 --> 10:20.431
It will ache for a few days,
but it should be fine.

10:20.518 --> 10:24.433
Thank you. Well,
I'll say this about your Enterprise,

10:24.523 --> 10:27.477
the doctors
are a fair sight prettier.

10:29.361 --> 10:33.145
I'm Jean-Luc Picard.
Welcome aboard, Capt Scott.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.861
Thank you, sir, and call me Scotty.

10:35.951 --> 10:40.447
- How are you feeling?
- I don't know. How am I feeling?

10:40.998 --> 10:44.782
Other than a few bumps,
you're fine for a man of 147.

10:44.877 --> 10:48.127
And I don't feel a day over 120.

10:49.340 --> 10:54.002
It must say, I was surprised
you were on board the Jenolen.

10:54.094 --> 10:56.632
Our records didn't show you as crew.

10:56.722 --> 11:02.143
I was never crew.
I was just a passenger.

11:02.937 --> 11:07.480
I was heading for Norpin V to
settle down and enjoy my retirement.

11:07.567 --> 11:11.944
I see. I would enjoy
hearing you talk about your career.

11:12.029 --> 11:15.944
I'm sure you would have fascinating
insights into your time.

11:16.034 --> 11:19.319
- I'd be happy to.
- Good. I look forward to it.

11:19.412 --> 11:23.244
We need to begin a full
spectrograph analysis of the sphere.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.206
- I'll get right on it.
- Good.

11:25.293 --> 11:29.373
- Once again, welcome on board.
- I need to get to Engineering.

11:29.464 --> 11:32.251
Engineering!
I thought you'd never ask!

11:33.802 --> 11:37.253
Captain, the first thing
you need to get is rest.

11:37.347 --> 11:40.383
This has been a shock.
Don't push yourself.

11:41.059 --> 11:43.099
We're pretty busy down there.

11:43.186 --> 11:46.686
I promise I'll give you a tour
when it's OK.

11:46.773 --> 11:50.059
I'll find someone
to show you your quarters.

11:52.821 --> 11:54.565
Aye.

12:01.538 --> 12:05.239
This is the food replicator
and your computer terminal.

12:05.334 --> 12:08.537
Good Lord, man,
where have you put me?

12:08.629 --> 12:11.001
These are standard guest quarters.

12:11.090 --> 12:14.541
- I can try to find something bigger.
- Bigger?

12:14.635 --> 12:20.555
In my day, even an admiral
wouldn't have had such quarters.

12:20.641 --> 12:25.599
I remember when we had
to transport the Dohlman of Elas.

12:25.688 --> 12:29.900
You never heard anyone whine
so much about quarters as she did.

12:29.984 --> 12:34.064
The holodecks, ten-forward and
the gymnasium are at your disposal.

12:34.155 --> 12:36.563
The computer
will tell you how to find them.

12:36.658 --> 12:39.030
Use these panels
if you need anything.

12:39.118 --> 12:43.448
These quarters remind me
of a hotel room on Argelius.

12:43.540 --> 12:45.947
Now, there is a planet.

12:46.042 --> 12:49.127
Everything a man wants
right at his fingertips.

12:49.212 --> 12:51.584
Of course, on the first visit...

12:51.673 --> 12:54.294
Excuse me, I have to return to duty.

12:57.512 --> 12:58.971
Well, then...

12:59.806 --> 13:01.051
Thank you.

13:31.130 --> 13:35.507
Shut down the warp engines
and recalibrate the aft sensors.

13:35.593 --> 13:37.253
Aye, sir.

13:40.098 --> 13:41.473
Can I help you, sir?

13:41.557 --> 13:44.891
I don't think so, lassie.
I'll let you know if you can.

13:44.977 --> 13:47.599
Sir, this area is restricted.

13:47.689 --> 13:50.559
Bartel, it's OK. I'll handle it.
Capt Scott...

13:50.650 --> 13:53.604
We're in Engineering. Call me Scotty.

13:53.695 --> 13:56.268
Scotty,
this isn't the time for a tour.

13:56.364 --> 13:59.318
We're running a phase-seven survey
of the sphere.

13:59.409 --> 14:03.988
I'm not here for a tour, laddie.
I'm here to help.

14:05.498 --> 14:08.784
That's very kind
but we can handle it.

14:09.377 --> 14:15.582
I was a Starfleet engineer
for 52 years, Mr. La Forge.

14:15.676 --> 14:17.917
I think I'm still useful.

14:20.138 --> 14:23.638
You're right.
We'd be grateful for your help.

14:23.725 --> 14:26.181
Good. Let's get to work.

14:27.771 --> 14:32.101
Sensors indicate a G-type star
at the centre of the sphere.

14:32.192 --> 14:36.356
There is a Class-M atmosphere
clinging to the interior surface.

14:36.447 --> 14:38.605
Any indication it is inhabited?

14:38.699 --> 14:40.028
Not as yet.

14:40.117 --> 14:44.495
Our preliminary data suggests
it is capable of supporting life.

14:44.580 --> 14:48.032
We have been unable to find signs
of current habitation.

14:48.125 --> 14:53.167
Mr. Data, send class-four probes
to survey the far side of the sphere.

14:53.256 --> 14:56.874
- Perhaps they'll have more luck.
- Aye, sir.

14:56.968 --> 14:59.922
Adjust the frequency
of the main deflector...

15:00.013 --> 15:04.758
You need to phase-lock
the warp fields within three percent.

15:04.851 --> 15:07.093
- What?
- Look here.

15:10.815 --> 15:14.065
We use a multiphase-autocontainment
field now.

15:14.152 --> 15:16.773
It's meant to operate
above three percent.

15:16.863 --> 15:20.066
Well, that would make the difference.

15:20.158 --> 15:22.614
We can restart the engines
in ten minutes.

15:22.702 --> 15:24.113
Thank you.

15:24.204 --> 15:28.071
I remember a time
when the old Enterprise

15:28.166 --> 15:31.286
was spiralling towards Psi 2000.

15:31.378 --> 15:32.457
Thank you.

15:32.546 --> 15:37.541
The Captain wanted to try
a cold start of the warp engines.

15:37.634 --> 15:42.629
I told him that without a phase lock,
it would take 30 minutes.

15:42.723 --> 15:46.139
"You cannot change
the laws of physics," I told him.

15:46.226 --> 15:48.303
He wouldn't believe me.

15:48.395 --> 15:52.096
I came up with a whole
new engine-start-up routine.

15:52.191 --> 15:55.940
Do you know your dilithium crystals
are going to fracture?

16:04.120 --> 16:05.911
We recomposite the crystals

16:05.997 --> 16:08.998
while they're still
inside the articulation frame.

16:09.083 --> 16:12.120
Look, I'd love
to explain everything to you

16:12.211 --> 16:16.624
but the Captain wants
this analysis done by 1300 hours.

16:34.651 --> 16:36.940
Do you mind a little advice?

16:38.655 --> 16:41.941
Starfleet captains are like children.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.904
They want everything right now
and their way.

16:44.995 --> 16:49.207
But the secret is to give them
only what they need.

16:49.291 --> 16:52.458
I said
I'd have this done in an hour.

16:52.544 --> 16:56.922
- How long will it really take?
- An hour.

16:57.007 --> 17:00.092
You didn't tell him how long
it would really take?

17:00.177 --> 17:01.969
Of course I did.

17:02.054 --> 17:07.843
Laddie, if you want people to think
of you as a miracle worker...

17:07.935 --> 17:12.431
Capt Scott! I've tried to be patient,
I've tried to be polite.

17:12.522 --> 17:16.686
But I've got a job to do here.
Frankly, you're in the way.

17:17.987 --> 17:20.905
I was driving starships

17:20.990 --> 17:25.569
while your great-grandfather
was still in diapers.

17:25.661 --> 17:29.077
I'd think you'd be grateful
for some help.

17:30.166 --> 17:33.251
I'll leave you to work, Mr. La Forge.

18:03.700 --> 18:07.994
- May I help you, sir?
- Aye, lad. Scotch, neat.

18:13.419 --> 18:15.043
There you go, sir.

18:16.005 --> 18:17.878
Thank you.

18:19.717 --> 18:23.667
- What in blazes is this?
- Didn't you order Scotch?

18:23.763 --> 18:30.477
Laddie, I was drinking Scotch
100 years before you were born.

18:30.561 --> 18:35.270
I can tell you, whatever this is,
it is definitely not Scotch.

18:35.358 --> 18:37.647
I believe I may be of assistance.

18:37.735 --> 18:40.522
Capt Scott is unaware of synthehol.

18:40.613 --> 18:42.405
Synthehol?

18:42.490 --> 18:47.033
Yes, sir. It is an alcohol substitute
served aboard starships.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.703
It simulates the appearance,
taste and smell of alcohol,

18:50.790 --> 18:53.957
but the intoxicating effects
can be easily dismissed.

18:54.044 --> 18:57.460
You're not quite human, are you?

18:57.547 --> 19:01.759
No, sir. I am an android.
Lt Cmdr Data.

19:04.137 --> 19:07.720
Synthetic Scotch.
Synthetic commanders.

19:09.142 --> 19:13.389
I believe Guinan does keep a supply
of non-syntheholic products.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.766
Perhaps one of them
would be to your liking.

19:27.328 --> 19:29.616
- What is it?
- It is...

19:34.835 --> 19:36.246
It is...

19:39.507 --> 19:41.832
It is green.

20:11.456 --> 20:13.330
Please enter program.

20:13.416 --> 20:17.035
The android at the bar
said you could show me my old ship.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.623
Let me see it.

20:18.713 --> 20:23.340
Insufficient data.
Please specify parameters.

20:23.427 --> 20:24.802
The Enterprise.

20:24.886 --> 20:29.264
Show me the bridge of the Enterprise,
you chattering piece of...

20:29.349 --> 20:32.553
There have been five
Federation ships with that name.

20:32.644 --> 20:35.314
Please specify by registry number.

20:37.274 --> 20:43.194
NCC-1701 .

20:43.614 --> 20:49.652
No bloody A, B, C or D.

20:50.413 --> 20:53.746
Program complete.
Enter when ready.

21:49.807 --> 21:51.883
Here's to you, lads.

22:08.826 --> 22:10.985
I hope I'm not interrupting.

22:12.079 --> 22:16.492
I was coming off duty.
I wanted to see how you were doing.

22:18.544 --> 22:22.625
Not at all.
Would you have a drink with me?

22:22.715 --> 22:24.091
Thank you.

22:28.721 --> 22:33.549
I don't know what it is exactly,
but I would be careful. It's real...

22:35.937 --> 22:37.515
Aldebaran whiskey.

22:38.898 --> 22:40.856
Who do you think gave it to Guinan?

22:49.159 --> 22:51.567
- Constitution class.
- Aye.

22:52.871 --> 22:58.210
- Are you familiar with them?
- There's one in the Fleet museum.

22:58.293 --> 23:02.540
But then, of course,
this is your Enterprise.

23:02.631 --> 23:07.127
I actually served on two.
This was the first.

23:07.219 --> 23:13.092
She was also the first ship
I ever served on as chief engineer.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.344
You know, I served aboard 11 ships.

23:17.438 --> 23:21.851
Freighters, cruisers, starships.

23:21.942 --> 23:26.984
But this is the only one
I think of, the only one I miss.

23:27.073 --> 23:32.827
The first vessel that I served on
as captain was called Stargazer.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.577
It was an overworked,
underpowered vessel,

23:36.666 --> 23:39.335
always on the verge of flying apart.

23:39.419 --> 23:44.959
In every measurable sense,
my Enterprise is far superior.

23:45.049 --> 23:50.044
But there are times
when I would give almost anything

23:50.138 --> 23:52.131
to command the Stargazer again.

23:52.891 --> 23:56.058
It's like the first time
you fall in love.

23:56.144 --> 24:01.221
You don't ever love a woman
quite like that again.

24:02.776 --> 24:07.983
Well, to the Enterprise
and the Stargazer.

24:08.073 --> 24:11.608
Old girlfriends
we'll never meet again.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.747
What do you think of Enterprise D?

24:21.211 --> 24:24.212
She's a beauty with a good crew.

24:24.298 --> 24:26.291
- But?
- But...

24:27.635 --> 24:33.009
When I was here, I could tell you
the speed that we were travelling

24:33.099 --> 24:35.637
by the feel of the deck plates.

24:36.394 --> 24:40.522
But on your ship,
I feel like I'm just in the way.

24:40.606 --> 24:43.228
75 years is a long time.

24:44.485 --> 24:48.186
If you would care to study
some technical schematics...

24:48.281 --> 24:52.658
I'm not 18.
I can't start out like a raw cadet.

24:53.369 --> 24:55.243
No, there comes a time

24:55.330 --> 24:59.790
when a man finds
that he can't fall in love again.

25:00.710 --> 25:03.201
He knows that it's time to stop.

25:04.047 --> 25:08.923
I don't belong on your ship.
I belong on this one.

25:09.010 --> 25:14.052
This was my home.
This is where I had a purpose.

25:17.185 --> 25:22.524
But it's not real. It's just
a computer-generated fantasy.

25:23.525 --> 25:27.143
And I'm just an old man
trying to hide in it.

25:27.863 --> 25:32.075
Computer,
shut this bloody thing off.

25:33.577 --> 25:36.364
It's time I acted my age.

25:48.843 --> 25:49.874
Come.

25:53.723 --> 25:57.767
Mr. La Forge, I understand
that before the Jenolen crashed,

25:57.852 --> 26:02.064
it had conducted a survey
of the Dyson Sphere.

26:02.148 --> 26:04.437
Have we accessed those records?

26:04.525 --> 26:08.440
We tried to download their
memory core, but it was damaged.

26:08.529 --> 26:11.281
We haven't got much out of it.

26:11.366 --> 26:17.036
Perhaps Capt Scott could be of use
in accessing that material.

26:17.747 --> 26:22.290
It's possible. He knows those systems
better than any of us.

26:22.377 --> 26:26.161
- I'll have Lt Bartel beam down.
- Mr. La Forge.

26:29.718 --> 26:33.051
I would like you
to accompany Capt Scott.

26:33.930 --> 26:35.508
- Me?
- Yes.

26:36.350 --> 26:38.556
Look, this is not an order.

26:38.644 --> 26:44.314
It's a request and it's one
that you must feel free to decline.

26:45.275 --> 26:49.937
One of the most important things
in a person's life is to feel useful.

26:50.030 --> 26:53.115
Now, Mr. Scott
is a Starfleet officer.

26:53.200 --> 26:57.494
I would like him
to feel useful again.

26:58.664 --> 27:00.871
I'll go with him, sir.

27:02.251 --> 27:03.995
Thank you.

27:07.423 --> 27:08.917
Commander.

27:09.008 --> 27:13.469
I have found something which
could be a communications device.

27:13.554 --> 27:15.179
There is an antenna array

27:15.264 --> 27:19.013
400,000 kilometers south
of our present position.

27:19.102 --> 27:22.103
It is emitting
low-intensity subspace signals.

27:22.188 --> 27:26.400
- Can you open a channel?
- Not from our present orbit.

27:26.484 --> 27:29.022
The array is directed away from us.

27:29.112 --> 27:31.864
Ensign, prepare to put us in orbit.

27:31.948 --> 27:34.071
Capt Picard, to the bridge.

27:40.081 --> 27:41.741
Are you feeling alright?

27:41.833 --> 27:46.460
Never get drunk unless you're
willing to pay for it, the next day.

27:46.546 --> 27:48.338
I'll manage.

27:48.423 --> 27:50.297
OK.

27:56.515 --> 27:58.093
Energize.

28:14.533 --> 28:18.401
Sensors indicate that the large
circle is a portal or airlock,

28:18.496 --> 28:20.903
possibly leading to the interior.

28:20.998 --> 28:24.118
Looks like the front door.
Should we ring the bell?

28:24.210 --> 28:28.124
Mr. Worf, open a channel
to that communications array.

28:28.214 --> 28:30.005
Aye, sir.

28:32.260 --> 28:36.471
- A tractor beam has locked on to us.
- Get us out of here.

28:36.931 --> 28:41.640
We've lost main power.
Auxiliary power down to 20 percent.

28:46.399 --> 28:48.356
We're being pulled inside.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.287
Auxiliary power failing.

29:08.422 --> 29:12.336
The frequency of the beam
is incompatible with our systems.

29:12.426 --> 29:15.842
Warp- and impulse-engine relays
have been overloaded.

29:15.929 --> 29:17.803
I am attempting to compensate.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.189
The tractor beams have released us.

29:32.113 --> 29:34.189
Hold until we get our bearing.

29:34.282 --> 29:37.448
Full sensor sweep. Where are we?

29:37.535 --> 29:41.402
90,000,000 kilometers
from the star's photosphere.

29:41.497 --> 29:43.704
I am reading surface instability.

29:43.791 --> 29:45.535
- It may...
- Sir!

29:45.626 --> 29:49.707
The inertial from the tractor beams
is still carrying us forward.

29:49.797 --> 29:53.878
Impulse engines are off line.
I can't stop our momentum.

29:54.302 --> 29:56.971
We're falling directly into the star.

30:07.899 --> 30:11.767
The primary database
should be on line now. Give it a try.

30:11.862 --> 30:13.404
OK.

30:15.824 --> 30:19.323
I've got three access lines
to the central core.

30:19.912 --> 30:21.821
Still nothing.

30:21.914 --> 30:24.831
Bunch of old, useless garbage!

30:25.834 --> 30:30.580
I say it's old. It can't handle
the interface of your converter.

30:30.673 --> 30:34.801
This equipment was designed
for a different era.

30:36.387 --> 30:38.676
Now it's a piece of junk.

30:38.764 --> 30:41.849
I don't know.
It's held together pretty well.

30:41.934 --> 30:46.561
A century out of date.
It's just obsolete.

30:47.356 --> 30:50.026
You know, that's interesting.

30:50.109 --> 30:55.352
I think these systems haven't changed
much in the last 75 years.

30:56.115 --> 31:00.861
This transporter is basically the
same system we use on the Enterprise.

31:00.954 --> 31:03.908
Subspace radio and sensors
still operate

31:03.998 --> 31:05.790
under the same basic principle.

31:05.875 --> 31:09.042
Impulse engines
haven't changed much in 200 years.

31:09.129 --> 31:12.462
If it wasn't for the damage,
it might be in service.

31:12.549 --> 31:14.506
Maybe so.

31:16.303 --> 31:20.051
But when they can build ships
like your Enterprise,

31:20.140 --> 31:22.845
who'd pilot an old bucket like this?

31:22.934 --> 31:25.390
I don't know.
If she were operational,

31:25.479 --> 31:29.097
I bet she'd run circles round
the Enterprise at impulse speeds.

31:29.191 --> 31:32.227
Just because something's old,
don't throw it away.

31:34.613 --> 31:38.231
We used to have something
called a dynamic-mode converter.

31:38.325 --> 31:41.112
You wouldn't have
something like that?

31:41.495 --> 31:45.659
I haven't seen anything like that
in a long time.

31:45.749 --> 31:48.323
But I could come up
with something similar.

31:48.752 --> 31:51.041
La Forge to Enterprise.

31:51.839 --> 31:54.544
La Forge to Enterprise,
come in, please.

31:58.763 --> 32:02.214
- Interference?
- No, they're gone.

32:04.936 --> 32:08.055
We will enter the photosphere
in three minutes.

32:08.147 --> 32:09.855
Manoeuvring thrusters?

32:09.941 --> 32:12.562
30 percent power.
Not enough to stop us.

32:12.652 --> 32:17.563
No, but it may be enough to turn us
into orbit and hold our distance.

32:17.657 --> 32:21.607
Port thrusters, ahead full.
Starboard thrusters, back full.

32:22.871 --> 32:26.370
Our flight path is changing.
Right 10.7 degrees.

32:26.458 --> 32:29.031
Insufficient
to clear the photosphere.

32:29.127 --> 32:33.919
Lt Bartel, divert all power
to the manoeuvring thrusters.

32:34.007 --> 32:35.038
Aye, sir.

32:40.639 --> 32:45.301
We're in orbit, Captain.
Our altitude is 150,000 kilometers.

32:47.062 --> 32:49.470
I'll try to get main power
back on line.

32:49.982 --> 32:51.773
Very well.

32:51.859 --> 32:56.568
Mr. Data, begin a scan of
the interior surface for life forms.

32:56.655 --> 33:00.071
I want to know
who brought us in here and why.

33:00.159 --> 33:01.534
Aye, sir.

33:03.204 --> 33:05.327
I can't find them in orbit.

33:05.414 --> 33:07.952
They could have crashed
into the sphere.

33:08.042 --> 33:11.458
We'd pick up background radiation
if they'd gone down.

33:11.545 --> 33:13.538
There's another possibility.

33:13.631 --> 33:16.751
They could be inside the sphere.

33:16.842 --> 33:20.675
Maybe. Whatever happened,
we've got to find them.

33:20.763 --> 33:25.390
If we got the engines on line, we
could track their impulse-ion trail.

33:25.476 --> 33:29.011
Are you daft?
The main drive assembly is shot.

33:29.105 --> 33:32.723
The inducers have melted.
The power couplings are wrecked.

33:32.817 --> 33:36.945
We'd need a week to get started.
But we don't have a week.

33:37.030 --> 33:39.947
So, no sense in crying about it.

33:40.033 --> 33:43.616
We'll see what we can do
with your power converter.

33:44.287 --> 33:46.825
The sphere appears to be abandoned.

33:46.915 --> 33:50.118
Sensors show that the star
is extremely unstable.

33:50.210 --> 33:54.124
It is experiencing bursts
of radiation and matter expulsions.

33:54.214 --> 33:56.752
That would explain
why they abandoned it.

33:56.842 --> 34:00.886
But if no one is living there,
how were we brought inside?

34:00.971 --> 34:04.174
I believe we triggered
automatic piloting beams,

34:04.266 --> 34:06.674
designed to guide ships
into the sphere.

34:06.769 --> 34:10.813
Sir, sensors show a large
magnetic disturbance on the star.

34:10.898 --> 34:12.889
It is a solar flare.

34:12.983 --> 34:15.141
Magnitude 12, class-B.

34:19.114 --> 34:20.489
Shields?

34:20.574 --> 34:22.982
Shields are up,
but only at 23 percent.

34:23.869 --> 34:25.992
There is increased activity.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.414
Sensors indicate solar flares
will continue to grow.

34:30.083 --> 34:34.580
In three hours, our shields
will no longer protect us, sir.

34:46.768 --> 34:51.097
Shunt the deuterium from the main
cryopump to the auxiliary tank.

34:51.188 --> 34:54.309
The tank can't withstand
that kind of pressure.

34:55.652 --> 34:58.225
Where did you get that idea?

34:58.321 --> 35:00.991
What do you mean,
where did I get that idea?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.451
It's in the impulse-engine
specifications.

35:04.536 --> 35:10.206
Regulation 42/15, pressure variances
on the IRC-tank storage?

35:10.292 --> 35:13.412
- Yeah.
- Forget it. I wrote it.

35:14.254 --> 35:18.667
A good engineer is always a wee bit
conservative on paper.

35:18.759 --> 35:23.220
Just bypass the cut-off valve
and boost the flow. It'll work.

35:23.806 --> 35:25.430
OK.

35:27.810 --> 35:30.479
If we've done our jobs properly,

35:30.563 --> 35:35.604
the engines should be coming back
on line about now.

35:40.448 --> 35:44.777
You were right.
The auxiliary tank is holding.

35:45.620 --> 35:47.493
Take the bridge, Commander.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.999
No. You're the senior officer here.

35:51.084 --> 35:53.788
I may be captain by rank,

35:54.337 --> 35:59.165
but I never wanted to be
anything else but an engineer.

36:04.305 --> 36:05.550
Alright.

36:12.606 --> 36:16.188
Shields still holding
but they are down another 15 percent.

36:16.276 --> 36:19.111
Can we use the phasers
to open a hole in the sphere?

36:19.196 --> 36:22.647
No. The exterior shell
is composed of carbon neutronium.

36:22.741 --> 36:24.650
Weapons would be ineffective.

36:24.743 --> 36:27.946
Mr. Data, we have to find
some way out of here.

36:28.038 --> 36:32.250
Begin scanning for another portal
that might still be open.

36:32.334 --> 36:36.248
The surface area is over
10 to the 16th square kilometers.

36:36.338 --> 36:39.125
It will take seven hours to scan,
sir.

36:43.220 --> 36:45.711
I will endeavour
to speed up the process.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.813
The Enterprise ion trail
leads to this point.

36:55.900 --> 36:57.939
It looks like a doorway.

36:58.736 --> 37:03.897
I bet you two bottles of Scotch
that they're inside the sphere

37:03.991 --> 37:07.906
and that they went in
right through that hatch.

37:07.996 --> 37:12.704
No bet here. The question is how?

37:13.376 --> 37:16.543
Look at the momentum distribution
of the ions.

37:16.629 --> 37:20.497
It would take an impulse engine
full-reverse

37:20.592 --> 37:22.750
to put out a signature like that.

37:22.844 --> 37:25.549
So they didn't go in willingly.

37:27.057 --> 37:30.640
This looks like
some kind of communications array.

37:30.727 --> 37:34.807
Aye. We found hundreds of them
when we did our initial survey.

37:34.898 --> 37:36.440
- Did you hail them?
- Aye.

37:36.525 --> 37:40.736
That was standard procedure.
We did it right before we crashed.

37:40.821 --> 37:42.363
Yeah.

37:42.447 --> 37:46.196
Hailing is standard procedure today,
too.

37:46.452 --> 37:48.195
Scotty.

37:49.705 --> 37:54.248
What if those aren't
communications arrays?

37:54.710 --> 37:56.952
What if they're access terminals

37:57.046 --> 38:01.126
which are triggered by subspace
signals on certain frequencies?

38:01.217 --> 38:03.838
Frequencies
like our standard ship's hail.

38:03.928 --> 38:05.386
Exactly.

38:05.471 --> 38:10.133
The Enterprise, when they saw that
terminal, did what you did.

38:10.226 --> 38:13.559
Opened a channel.
But they triggered something

38:13.646 --> 38:16.766
that activated that hatch
and pulled the ship inside.

38:16.858 --> 38:20.523
Very nice piece of reasoning.
Nice, indeed.

38:20.611 --> 38:24.905
Yeah. We could trigger the hatch,
only we'd get pulled in, too.

38:24.991 --> 38:29.700
Maybe all we need to do
is to get our foot in the door.

38:31.956 --> 38:36.998
We might not be pulled inside
when the hatch opens

38:37.087 --> 38:41.036
if we keep our distance
from the sphere.

38:41.132 --> 38:44.667
Say, half-a-million kilometers.

38:45.387 --> 38:47.759
Then, when the hatch
starts to close,

38:47.848 --> 38:51.466
we move in and we use the Jenolen
to jam the hatch open,

38:51.560 --> 38:54.312
hoping that the Enterprise
will escape.

38:54.396 --> 38:56.056
You can't be serious.

38:56.815 --> 39:00.564
That hatch is huge.
It'll crush this ship like an egg.

39:00.652 --> 39:03.772
The shields will hold.
Don't worry about that.

39:03.864 --> 39:07.613
I can get a few extra gigawatts
out of these babies.

39:07.701 --> 39:09.610
- It's crazy.
- Geordi.

39:09.703 --> 39:12.574
I have spent my whole life

39:12.665 --> 39:16.449
trying to figure out
crazy ways of doing things.

39:17.044 --> 39:22.668
I'm telling you, as one engineer
to another, I can do this.

39:26.679 --> 39:29.135
Alright. Let's do it.

39:34.479 --> 39:37.230
We're at 500,000 kilometers.

39:37.315 --> 39:39.224
Engines are ready.

39:39.317 --> 39:42.401
OK. Here we go.

39:50.036 --> 39:53.037
Come on. There's nothing out here.

39:53.123 --> 39:54.665
Give it up.

40:00.255 --> 40:03.042
That's it. Let's go. Full impulse.

40:15.104 --> 40:18.638
Sir, there's an audio message
from Cmdr La Forge.

40:18.732 --> 40:21.021
Enterprise, do you read me?

40:21.110 --> 40:22.818
Go ahead. We read you.

40:22.903 --> 40:26.153
We're using the Jenolen
to hold open the hatch.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.363
Our shields won't hold out.

40:28.450 --> 40:31.024
Understood. Ensign, set a course.

40:42.381 --> 40:46.047
The plasma intercooler's gone.
The engines are overheating.

40:50.223 --> 40:51.883
I've lost helm control.

40:51.975 --> 40:53.718
La Forge to Enterprise.

40:53.810 --> 40:57.393
Captain, we won't be able to move
when you get here.

40:57.480 --> 41:00.054
You'll have to destroy it to escape.

41:00.150 --> 41:02.107
How long before we reach them?

41:02.694 --> 41:07.819
With impulse engines at 60 percent,
one minute, 40 seconds.

41:07.908 --> 41:10.149
Bridge to transporter room three,

41:10.243 --> 41:14.075
prepare to beam two from the Jenolen
when we're within range.

41:20.796 --> 41:24.379
It's coming apart, lad.
I can't do anything else.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.961
Photon torpedoes armed and ready.

41:32.516 --> 41:34.509
We are within transporter range.

41:34.601 --> 41:36.890
Bridge to transporter room, energize.

41:36.979 --> 41:38.521
Aye, sir.

41:39.315 --> 41:41.272
Fire torpedoes.

42:04.173 --> 42:07.377
There, now,
that wasn't so bad, was it?

42:09.679 --> 42:13.463
Captain's log, stardate 46 125.3.

42:13.558 --> 42:16.476
Starfleet has dispatched
two science vessels

42:16.561 --> 42:18.470
to study the Dyson Sphere

42:18.563 --> 42:21.268
while we proceed to Star base 55.

42:21.358 --> 42:25.307
So, this alien space baby,
the size of a four-storey building,

42:25.403 --> 42:27.895
thought the Enterprise
was its mother.

42:27.989 --> 42:30.445
- You're pulling my leg.
- No, really.

42:30.534 --> 42:34.448
It was suckling power directly
from the ship's fusion reactors.

42:34.538 --> 42:37.574
Dr Brahms and I
changed the power frequency

42:37.666 --> 42:41.331
from 21 centimeters
to 0.02 centimeters.

42:41.420 --> 42:44.540
- So you soured the milk!
- That's right.

42:45.591 --> 42:48.426
Enjoy these times, Geordi.

42:48.927 --> 42:52.297
You're the chief engineer
of a starship.

42:52.389 --> 42:55.889
And it's a time of your life
that'll never come again.

42:56.310 --> 42:59.761
When it's gone, it's gone.

42:59.855 --> 43:03.307
I thought you were going
to buy me a drink in ten-forward.

43:03.401 --> 43:05.607
Actually, I had a better idea.

43:14.996 --> 43:19.041
You're giving me
one of your shuttles?

43:19.125 --> 43:21.248
Well, call it an extended loan.

43:21.336 --> 43:25.333
Since you lost your ship saving ours,
it seemed only fair.

43:25.423 --> 43:30.216
- She's not much to look at.
- Every woman has her own charm.

43:30.303 --> 43:32.711
You just have to know where to look.

43:32.806 --> 43:35.972
She's slow, but she'll get you
to the Norpin Colony,

43:36.059 --> 43:38.135
if that's where you want to go.

43:38.228 --> 43:42.475
The Norpin Colony
is for old men to retire.

43:42.566 --> 43:46.943
Maybe someday I'll end up there,
but not yet.

43:47.571 --> 43:48.851
Well...

43:48.947 --> 43:52.897
- Bon voyage, Mr. Scott.
- Thank you, sir, for everything.

43:52.993 --> 43:55.235
- Mr. Scott.
- Goodbye.

43:55.329 --> 43:56.787
Bye-bye.

43:56.872 --> 43:58.497
- Scotty.
- Thank you.

43:58.582 --> 44:00.824
Bye. Be well.

44:03.963 --> 44:06.418
- A good crew.
- Yeah, they are.

44:06.507 --> 44:09.543
And a fine ship.
A credit to her name.

44:10.302 --> 44:15.842
But I've always found that a ship
is only as good as her engineer.

44:15.933 --> 44:21.094
From what I can see,
the Enterprise is in good hands.

44:28.946 --> 44:32.362
You take care of yourself
out there.

44:32.450 --> 44:33.909
Aye.
