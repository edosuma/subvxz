00:04.245 --> 00:07.648
Mr. Lattimer,
my name's Frederic.

00:07.715 --> 00:09.383
What's that?

00:09.450 --> 00:11.552
An invitation
to endless wonder.

00:11.619 --> 00:13.687
- No!
- Aah...

00:16.977 --> 00:20.138
H.G. Wells was
a formidable opponent.

00:20.206 --> 00:21.501
She fooled us all.

00:21.569 --> 00:22.701
You can't blame yourself.

00:22.769 --> 00:24.368
It could have happened
to any one of us.

00:24.437 --> 00:28.047
But I put the entire world
in jeopardy.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.786
I can't take that chance again.

Let's go, bomb squad.
Another group!

00:58.184 --> 00:59.954
What the hell were you
doing in there?

01:00.021 --> 01:02.424
For the hundredth time--
I told you, I <i>work</i> here!

01:02.491 --> 01:04.391
I just brought some chick in
after hours...

01:04.459 --> 01:06.696
and she's into Hendrix,
so I grabbed his guitar...

01:06.763 --> 01:07.664
Yeah, yeah, we know
about the bomb, okay?

01:07.731 --> 01:09.432
Bomb? What bomb?

01:09.500 --> 01:11.701
I was just trying
to get lucky.

01:11.769 --> 01:13.136
Hey...

01:13.204 --> 01:15.137
He's telling the truth.
Oh, come on, Steve.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.907
- Chuck, he's not lying.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16.975 --> 01:18.008
You can always tell
when somebody's lying, right?

01:18.076 --> 01:19.443
Lucky you
and your special gift.

01:19.511 --> 01:20.711
Believe me,
it's not a gift

01:20.779 --> 01:22.179
to be able to tell
when someone's lying.

01:22.247 --> 01:24.883
- You ever been on a date?
- This guy is our only lead.

01:24.951 --> 01:26.418
The guy's clean.
There's no bomb.

01:26.486 --> 01:27.786
Well, there's something bad
going down in there, okay?

01:30.391 --> 01:31.557
It may not be any kind of bomb
we've seen before.

01:36.431 --> 01:39.533
Steve. Steve!
You listening?

01:39.601 --> 01:42.970
Yes. Fine. Whatever.

01:43.038 --> 01:46.173
Hey, Steve!
Jeez.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.312
So?

01:58.683 --> 02:00.517
Well, apparently
some Casanova decides

02:00.585 --> 02:02.386
to play Hendrix's guitar

02:02.454 --> 02:04.355
the same night that
we want to swap it out.

02:04.423 --> 02:06.023
I thought we already <i>had</i>
Hendrix's guitar.

02:06.091 --> 02:07.091
That's the one he torched
at Finsbury Park.

02:07.159 --> 02:08.559
In '67.

02:13.064 --> 02:15.033
Okay, listen,
we've gotta shut this down.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.167
You go deal with her.
Okay.

02:16.235 --> 02:17.235
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

02:17.302 --> 02:19.871
Here, slip this
on the nozzle.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.273
There's too much
errant electricity around here

02:21.340 --> 02:22.908
to risk using water.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.117
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:36.925 --> 02:38.792
Now, Claudia,
are you <i>sure</i> about this?

02:38.860 --> 02:40.694
Abso--mostly.

02:44.098 --> 02:48.703
What's that?

02:48.770 --> 02:51.539
Voila!
Tesla grenade.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.175
Slow turn and hands,
please.

02:56.345 --> 02:57.579
Listen, we work for
the museum. We're just here--

02:57.646 --> 02:59.414
Lie.

02:59.482 --> 03:01.182
We're under Presidential
orders to shut this place--

03:01.250 --> 03:02.784
Lie.

03:02.852 --> 03:05.020
Okay, that's my guitar,
and only, and only I can--

03:05.088 --> 03:05.987
- Lie.
- Even as we speak,

03:06.055 --> 03:08.189
this place is being surrounded

03:08.257 --> 03:10.024
by a legion of--
Oh, my God, quit lying!

03:10.092 --> 03:11.959
All right, <i>fine!</i>

03:12.027 --> 03:13.394
We are special agents
who find

03:13.462 --> 03:14.762
and neutralize dangerous
artifacts,

03:14.830 --> 03:17.297
and if she does not use
Jimi Hendrix's tremolo bar

03:17.365 --> 03:19.766
to bend the pitch
on those strings right now,

03:19.834 --> 03:22.102
this place will go crazy enough
to shut down

03:22.170 --> 03:25.239
the power grid
on the eastern seaboard.

03:25.307 --> 03:29.176

Thank you so much.

04:59.737 --> 05:01.204
See, I've gotta
turn this down

05:01.272 --> 05:03.640
because I'm way too close.
What is that?

05:03.708 --> 05:05.041
Nothing for you

Oh, you're lying.

- Sorry about the cold.
- Thank you so, so much.

05:14.284 --> 05:16.284
You saved my life.

05:16.352 --> 05:18.353
Oh, my God.
Is he okay?

05:18.420 --> 05:19.287
He's fine.

05:19.354 --> 05:21.956
God, I love firemen.

05:22.023 --> 05:25.493
How can I ever thank you?

05:27.262 --> 05:32.033

You're freezing.

05:33.435 --> 05:36.771
We'll sneak you out

05:36.839 --> 05:39.073
- Hey, Pete?
- Yeah?

05:39.141 --> 05:42.376
Uh, that girl's
really grateful to you.

05:42.444 --> 05:45.379
- Uh-huh.
- And cold.

05:45.447 --> 05:47.482
Really, really cold?

05:47.550 --> 05:49.518
We could see
how cold she was?

05:49.586 --> 05:52.688
I gave her my jacket.

05:52.756 --> 05:54.924
Pete, uh, what Claudia's
trying to say is that

05:54.992 --> 05:58.061
you were uncharacteristically...
Restrained

05:58.129 --> 06:00.831
in the face of all that...
Coldness.

06:00.898 --> 06:03.366
Just doing the job.

06:03.434 --> 06:06.236
Let's go. Come on.

06:06.304 --> 06:08.639
Okay, see, now even I miss
the boob jokes.

06:08.707 --> 06:11.408
We've gotta get Myka back.

06:25.523 --> 06:26.890
Steve, the director
wants to see you.

06:26.958 --> 06:28.225
He's not buying your story

06:28.292 --> 06:29.526
about the girl
with the purple gloves,

06:29.593 --> 06:30.927
your story about
the guy with the eyebrows,

06:30.995 --> 06:32.762
or all that stuff
about dangerous artifacts.

06:34.164 --> 06:37.699
Turn on the light.
We need to talk.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.208
What the hell?

06:46.276 --> 06:48.143
Who are you?
How'd you even get in here?

06:48.211 --> 06:51.213
My name is Mrs. Frederic.
I'm with the government.

06:51.281 --> 06:52.848
I'm here to make you
an offer, Steven.

06:52.916 --> 06:54.082
What?

06:54.150 --> 06:55.217
I have a position
to fill,

06:55.284 --> 06:56.952
and you seem to
fit the bill nicely.

06:57.020 --> 06:59.420
Are you kidding me?

07:01.657 --> 07:03.624
You're looking
into my eyes,

07:03.692 --> 07:05.627
so you already know
that I'm not.

07:05.694 --> 07:09.430
I want to introduce you
to a new world.

07:09.498 --> 07:11.232
Yeah, what kind of world?

07:14.937 --> 07:18.940
A world of endless wonder.

But I don't want

Put your glasses on.
There's a reason why

07:56.144 --> 07:58.011
we're unpacking Warehouse 2
in the ovoid quarantine!

07:58.079 --> 08:00.914
Nobody asked me if I wanted
a new partner.

08:00.982 --> 08:02.482
Yeah, well,
this isn't the army.

08:02.549 --> 08:03.883
We don't poll our troops
to get their opinion

08:03.950 --> 08:05.017
before we make a decision.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.352
Pete, really, glasses.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.553
Fine, fine, fine!

08:07.621 --> 08:09.955
Look, Artie,
you and Claudia were

08:10.023 --> 08:11.389
taking up the slack
just fine.

08:11.457 --> 08:12.657
Oh, thank you
so very much.

08:12.725 --> 08:14.392
The fact is I'm too old,
she's too young,

08:14.460 --> 08:15.393
and we are both needed here.

08:15.461 --> 08:17.495
You need a new field partner.

08:17.562 --> 08:19.730
Someone who's an equal, and
someone who's got <i>experience!</i>

08:19.798 --> 08:21.699
All right, well, then,
get Myka back.

08:21.767 --> 08:24.603
I have tried.
Mrs. Frederic has tried.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.905
Here, here, send her one
of Plato's tablets.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.575
She loved these!
Pete...

08:28.642 --> 08:31.177
We all miss her,
but we have got <i>work</i> to do.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.746
Get your head with the program,

08:32.813 --> 08:34.748
'cause the new guy's
gonna be here any minute.

08:34.816 --> 08:37.952
You know what...

08:38.019 --> 08:40.287
It feels a little like
my old dog

08:40.355 --> 08:41.922
just got sent to the farm,

08:41.990 --> 08:43.490
and you guys
are already shoving

08:43.558 --> 08:47.027
a new puppy down my throat.

09:12.991 --> 09:16.126
Hey, new guy.

09:16.194 --> 09:18.095
You are the new guy,
right?

09:18.163 --> 09:20.631
You...
You had the tremolo bar

09:20.699 --> 09:21.866
and the purple gloves--
I saw you.

09:21.934 --> 09:23.667
Yes, it's all true,
Dorothy.

09:23.735 --> 09:25.168

09:25.236 --> 09:27.871
New guy gets to fix
the fish.

09:27.938 --> 09:29.906
Whoa, nice wheels.
Prius, right?

09:29.974 --> 09:32.308
I've been looking
at this baby myself.

09:32.376 --> 09:35.944
Sprang for the solar roof
Nav Package I see. Shmancy.

09:36.012 --> 09:38.113
Listen, what, exactly,
is Warehouse 13?

09:38.181 --> 09:39.181
What do you guys do
out here?

09:39.249 --> 09:40.916
JBL four-CD changer,
of course.

09:40.984 --> 09:43.019
XM radio, cruise control,
Bluetooth.

09:43.087 --> 09:45.788
Intelligent parking assist.
iPod interface?

09:45.856 --> 09:49.125
Well, well, well, somebody
treated himself very nicely.

09:49.193 --> 09:50.793
End of the day, what'd your
mommy have to lay out

09:50.861 --> 09:52.295
for a car like this?
Agent Donovan.

09:52.362 --> 09:54.697
I'm not here
to sell you my car. Okay?

09:54.765 --> 09:56.399
I know why you're here.

09:56.467 --> 09:59.402
Follow me. Artie made cookies.

10:05.943 --> 10:08.011
That'll buff out.

10:08.078 --> 10:10.514
Artie likes to think of this
place as "America's Attic,"

10:10.581 --> 10:11.948
but that's really the nickname
for the Smithsonian,

10:12.016 --> 10:13.250
so we need a new subtitle.

10:13.317 --> 10:15.218
Pete pitched
"The World's Junk Drawer,"

10:15.286 --> 10:16.687
but I quite like
the "Library of Crazy,"

10:16.754 --> 10:17.821
or better yet,
"Artifact Roadshow."

10:17.889 --> 10:20.791
Don't touch the bombs.
Bombs?

10:20.859 --> 10:22.826
I mean, I don't need a guy
who can tell

10:22.894 --> 10:24.161
when somebody's lying.

10:24.229 --> 10:26.163
So what?
That's nothing special.

10:26.231 --> 10:28.365
I mean, every nun I ever met
could do that.

10:28.432 --> 10:31.135
Sister Mary Francis could tell
when you were <i>about</i> to lie.

10:31.202 --> 10:32.403
I don't care.

10:32.471 --> 10:34.272
You're working with Agent Jinks
starting today.

10:34.339 --> 10:36.541
Oh, and you're gonna
send me out

10:36.608 --> 10:38.309
on potentially
life-threatening missions

10:38.377 --> 10:39.644
with someone named <i>Jinks?</i>

10:39.711 --> 10:43.013
That's just great, Artie.

10:43.081 --> 10:46.149
Steve, Artie.
Artie, Steve.

10:46.217 --> 10:48.952
- Oh, hello.
- You...

10:49.020 --> 10:51.020
You're the guy
with the eyebrows.

10:51.088 --> 10:52.221
You neutralize
the dangerous artifacts.

10:52.289 --> 10:53.222
Yes, when they misbehave.

10:53.290 --> 10:55.658
Agent Steve Jinks,

10:55.726 --> 11:00.063
meet your new partner--
this is Agent Pete Lattimer.

11:00.131 --> 11:02.232
Jinks, hey, man,
how are you?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.001
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

11:04.069 --> 11:05.269
You're lying.

11:05.337 --> 11:07.004
Oh, yeah,
this is gonna be fun.

11:14.114 --> 11:16.449
Bob, I'm telling you
they're all in Denver.

11:16.516 --> 11:18.617
At the Regalton.

11:18.685 --> 11:20.853
I don't know, but when
this many big bank CEOs

11:20.921 --> 11:23.589
are all in one place,
it's gotta be news.

11:23.656 --> 11:24.790
Miss Hopper?

11:24.857 --> 11:28.526
Yes. Thank you.

11:28.594 --> 11:31.729
Yes, of course
I'll corroborate.

11:31.796 --> 11:34.865
I've already got a guy
on the inside.

11:34.933 --> 11:36.233
Hmm.

11:36.301 --> 11:40.303
Who knows I like figs?

11:40.371 --> 11:42.839
Nothing. Look, I'll file
the story late tomorrow.

11:42.907 --> 11:44.007
The major bigwigs arrive
in the morning--

11:44.075 --> 11:45.842
ow!

11:45.910 --> 11:47.511
Ow, something just bit me.

11:51.115 --> 11:55.952
Oh...Bob...Bob, help.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.053
Monica?

11:59.357 --> 12:01.891
Oh!

12:01.959 --> 12:04.295
Monica,
quit clowning around.

12:04.362 --> 12:06.997
Is this a joke?

12:07.065 --> 12:09.133
What's going on?
Are you all right?

12:09.200 --> 12:15.806
Oh, Antony, nay...
I will take thee too.

12:15.874 --> 12:18.676
Somebody call 911, now!

12:29.786 --> 12:31.500
Steve, welcome aboard.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.606
- You shot me with that thing.
- You don't want a cookie?

12:34.607 --> 12:36.774
No. Yeah,
but you did shoot me.

12:36.842 --> 12:38.542
Yes, it's called a Tesla.

12:38.543 --> 12:40.010
It was invented
by Nicola Tesla--

12:40.078 --> 12:41.478
About 1,000 years ago,
when Artie was a kid.

12:41.546 --> 12:43.714
Here's an idea--
why doesn't Jinksy just

12:43.782 --> 12:45.082
start here in the warehouse?

12:45.149 --> 12:46.483
You know, learn the ropes,
get his feet wet...

12:46.551 --> 12:48.584
Yes. Miss Donovan
could come with me.

12:48.652 --> 12:49.686
That's exactly what
I've been saying.

12:49.753 --> 12:51.220
- Should I--
- No, we're good.

12:51.288 --> 12:55.225
A decision has been made.

12:55.293 --> 12:57.727
Our job as Warehouse agents
is to

12:57.795 --> 12:59.696
find whatever's about
to ruin the world's day.

12:59.764 --> 13:01.599
Like finding
Jimi Hendrix's guitar.

13:01.666 --> 13:02.767
Precisely. Smart lad.

13:02.834 --> 13:05.236
Then snag it, bag it,
and tag it.

13:06.739 --> 13:10.376
I like to think of this as--
America's attic.

13:10.443 --> 13:13.479
Yes...

13:13.547 --> 13:16.848
Amer--all right.
Anyway...

13:16.916 --> 13:20.151
Welcome to Warehouse 13.

13:20.219 --> 13:22.787
Okay, that's all
we have time for.

13:22.855 --> 13:24.522
Now we've got work to do.

13:27.225 --> 13:28.492
You guys get storms
in here?

13:31.629 --> 13:34.030
Um, sometimes.

13:34.098 --> 13:36.199
- I need my--gotta get--
- Wait, it's operational.

13:36.266 --> 13:37.567
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

13:37.634 --> 13:39.269
No, it's not--
whoa, how did you do that?

13:39.336 --> 13:41.537
My way. Finished installing it
last night.

13:44.975 --> 13:48.845
That's coming directly
from the Ancient Archives.

13:48.913 --> 13:50.814
We've gotta--
don't just stand there.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.620
That's a pyramid.

13:57.688 --> 13:59.789
There's a <i>pyramid</i>
in the warehouse.

13:59.856 --> 14:01.090
That's right, Jinksy.

14:01.158 --> 14:03.692
We get on there,
we could win $25,000.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.328
- Joke, right? You're funny.
- You're not laughing.

14:06.396 --> 14:09.131
Well, I'm not a laugher.

14:09.198 --> 14:12.000
Great. Perfect. Fun.

14:12.068 --> 14:15.203
Get in here!

14:15.271 --> 14:17.606
What? What?
What's up?

14:25.115 --> 14:27.884
- You fixed the pneumatic tubes.
- Yep.

14:27.952 --> 14:29.185
- Did you--how did you...
- Nope.

14:29.253 --> 14:30.587
Imagine how such ingenuity

14:30.654 --> 14:31.788
could be put to use
in the field.

14:31.856 --> 14:32.656
Are you ever gonna
stop doing that?

14:32.723 --> 14:34.724
No.

14:34.792 --> 14:35.725
Artie, you better get
back down to the Ovoid.

14:35.793 --> 14:37.160
We have a situation.

14:37.228 --> 14:38.995
I'll get right on it.

14:43.267 --> 14:44.868
All right, Pete, you and I
are gonna check out the storm

14:44.935 --> 14:46.002
in the Ancient Archives.

14:46.070 --> 14:47.203
Claudia,
you're gonna take Steve.

14:47.271 --> 14:48.171
You're gonna find out
what is wrong

14:48.239 --> 14:49.372
in the Ovoid Quarantine.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.940
Ooh, what's
an Ovoid Quarantine?

14:51.008 --> 14:53.877
It's where we keep--

14:55.212 --> 14:56.179
Uh-oh.

14:56.247 --> 14:57.113
- How long ago?
- Where is it?

14:57.181 --> 14:58.514
A few hours. Denver.

14:58.582 --> 15:00.049
You still think we don't need
an extra set of hands?

15:00.117 --> 15:01.384
Is something wrong?

15:01.452 --> 15:03.119
- We got a ping.
- We got a ping.

15:07.958 --> 15:10.293
You saw the report.

15:10.361 --> 15:12.262
It says the lady died
of snakebite poisoning.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.097
A Russell's Viper, no less.

15:14.165 --> 15:17.401
But nobody found
any snakes anywhere.

15:17.469 --> 15:19.302
Hmm, yeah, well,
check around.

15:19.370 --> 15:21.738
It sounds like it could be
George Went Hensley's Bible.

15:21.806 --> 15:24.074
- George Went where now?
- George Went <i>Hensley.</i>

15:24.142 --> 15:26.309
Yeah, he was a 20th-century
snake-handling

15:26.377 --> 15:27.611
Bible-thumper from Tennessee.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.479
Got bitten 400 times
in his life.

15:29.547 --> 15:32.115
The last one finally killed him
in 1955.

15:32.183 --> 15:34.718
Wow. George: 400.
1.

15:34.786 --> 15:38.122
Guess he could have used
the shutout, eh, Jinksy?

15:38.190 --> 15:40.958
Artie, this kid's got
no sense of humor.

15:41.026 --> 15:42.360
He doesn't laugh
at the jokes.

15:42.428 --> 15:45.363
- Your jokes, Pete?
- Yes.

15:45.431 --> 15:48.066
Give that
a little more thought.

16:23.568 --> 16:26.871
Zeus...something's
completely freaked you out.

16:28.908 --> 16:31.175
So Buddhist, huh?

16:31.243 --> 16:34.312
Does that mean
you shave your head

16:34.380 --> 16:37.349
and dance around in robes?
Only at Christmas.

16:37.417 --> 16:39.151
Careful,
that's almost a joke.

16:39.219 --> 16:41.320
There's ashes
in the trash can.

16:41.388 --> 16:42.188
It's paper,
from what I can tell.

16:42.256 --> 16:43.723
Old. Maybe parchment.

16:43.791 --> 16:45.325
Charring residue indicates
it was burned

16:45.392 --> 16:47.294
within the last 12 hours.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:47.362 --> 16:49.096
Could be a combo platter

16:49.164 --> 16:51.733
which both kills someone
and burns up the evidence.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.534
What we call
an artifact twofer.

16:53.602 --> 16:56.103
There you go. That was funny.

16:56.171 --> 16:58.105
That wasn't a joke.

16:58.173 --> 17:00.074
Okay, I give up.
You're joking, you're not jok--

17:00.141 --> 17:02.275
All right, easy.
Easy there, birdie num-num.

17:02.343 --> 17:04.609
Look, you're gonna run
into things in this job.

17:04.678 --> 17:08.079
Gandhi's sandals
will calm you down so much

17:08.147 --> 17:09.615
that your heart will
stop beating.

17:09.682 --> 17:12.384
There's a badminton racket that
belonged to Charles Dickens.

17:12.452 --> 17:14.586
Makes you think
you're an orphan.

17:14.654 --> 17:17.021
I put on
Abe Lincoln's hat once

17:17.089 --> 17:20.693
and had an uncontrollable urge
to free Mrs. Frederic.

17:20.760 --> 17:25.632
Don't think that didn't
get me into trouble.

17:32.740 --> 17:34.642
What--
what are you doing?

17:34.709 --> 17:36.210
Did I say that
you could drive that thing?

17:36.278 --> 17:39.546
Yeah, that's
the pressing issue here.

17:39.614 --> 17:42.883
Something in <i>there</i>
has got Zeus panicked.

17:46.183 --> 17:47.411
They had identification.

17:47.412 --> 17:48.712
That's the only reason
I let 'em in.

17:49.265 --> 17:51.367
Hello there.
May I ask

17:51.434 --> 17:52.501
what y'all are doing
at my crime scene?

17:52.569 --> 17:54.503
Oh, hey, yeah.
Uh...

17:54.571 --> 17:56.739
Sorry, we should probably
speak to your supervisor.

17:56.806 --> 17:59.174
Agent Sally Stukowski, FBI.

17:59.241 --> 18:00.575
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

18:00.643 --> 18:02.743
Oh, good for you.

18:02.811 --> 18:04.879
Agent Pete Lattimer,
Secret Service.

18:04.947 --> 18:06.247
Agent Jinks, ATF.

18:06.315 --> 18:08.349
Really? Neither one
of those agencies

18:08.416 --> 18:09.516
is here,
to my knowledge.

18:09.584 --> 18:11.018
And what is the FBI
doing here?

18:11.086 --> 18:12.253
Isn't this a local
police matter?

18:12.320 --> 18:14.522
Oh, I don't know
if you've heard,

18:14.590 --> 18:17.024
but there's terrorists
in the world.

18:17.092 --> 18:19.161
So somebody gets poisoned,

18:19.228 --> 18:20.462
we like to look into
that kind of thing.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.564
What are you doing here?
Uh, oh, well,

18:22.632 --> 18:26.936
this woman was bitten by
a nonexistent Russell's Viper,

18:27.004 --> 18:29.906
and we like to look into
<i>that</i> kinda <i>thang,</i> Sally.

18:29.974 --> 18:32.175
Oh, you're funny...
and original.

18:32.243 --> 18:35.245
Interference in an FBI
investigation is a felony.

18:35.313 --> 18:36.947
Is this your first big case?

18:37.014 --> 18:40.150
Get out of my crime scene!

18:40.218 --> 18:43.654
Ha, ha, it is. I knew it!
Congrats. No...

18:43.721 --> 18:46.123
His too. I wasn't trying
to embarrass you.

18:46.191 --> 18:47.692
Oh, I'm not embarrassed. No.

18:47.759 --> 18:50.328
What I am is in charge.

18:50.396 --> 18:55.368
Boys...
Escort them out of here.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.172
Hello, boys.

18:59.240 --> 19:04.812
Okay, let's see how Hera
likes these apples.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.548
All right...

19:07.616 --> 19:10.384
Okay.

19:18.425 --> 19:19.792
She's burning it
right off.

19:19.860 --> 19:21.160
Yeah, it had no effect
on Zeus either.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.998
I don't know.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.532
Think. I'm gonna go back
to the office.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.634
I need a crash course
in Greek mythology.

19:37.810 --> 19:41.413
Hey, Charlie.
Somebody sent you a flier.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.183
Thanks.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.585
Hey, how'd you...

19:46.652 --> 19:50.588
What the hell is this?

19:52.558 --> 19:55.126
Oh...Oh, my God!

19:55.193 --> 19:56.994
Help me.

20:01.699 --> 20:04.534
Help!
Uh, help me!

20:09.639 --> 20:11.874
Help...

20:15.780 --> 20:18.449
<i>Kai su teknon?</i>

20:18.516 --> 20:22.854
<i>Kai su teknon?</i>

20:25.058 --> 20:28.194
No, no, there wasn't
anyone near him.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.763
And I'm guessing your name's
not "Kay Sue Teknon."

20:30.831 --> 20:32.632
I don't know why
he was calling me that.

20:32.699 --> 20:33.833
I thought he was
joking around.

20:33.901 --> 20:35.468
He was an actor, you know.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.137
- The hotel was just his day job.
- And what hotel is that?

20:38.205 --> 20:40.807
The Regalton, downtown.
Cater-waiter.

20:40.874 --> 20:43.242
Poor Charlie. I saw him
last year in <i>Anything Goes.</i>

20:43.310 --> 20:44.943
He was good.

20:45.011 --> 20:49.047
Not great, but good.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.483
Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

20:54.888 --> 20:57.223
Forensics says
he was stabbed 23 times

20:57.291 --> 20:59.559
with 23 different knives.
How very <i>Orient Express.</i>

20:59.627 --> 21:02.596
Maybe somebody's got Agatha
Christie's bedroom slippers.

21:02.664 --> 21:05.132
And on the floor, more ashes.
Agatha Christie's cigar?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.834
Don't be ridiculous.
Wait!

21:06.902 --> 21:08.870
The first victim
was doing a story

21:08.938 --> 21:10.305
about bankers meeting
at a hotel.

21:10.373 --> 21:12.674
- The Regalton Hotel, downtown.
- Hey, <i>hey,</i> hey!

21:12.742 --> 21:14.576
<i>Anything Goes.</i> Charlie here
was a waiter at the Regalton.

21:14.644 --> 21:15.944
- Coincidence?
- Hardly ever.

21:16.012 --> 21:18.080
But why waste your best
Charles Manson impression

21:18.148 --> 21:19.849
on a waiter?
Again!

21:19.916 --> 21:21.417
Why are you here, Lattimer?

21:21.485 --> 21:23.620
Oh, God, why does
every hot chick want me?

21:23.688 --> 21:26.524
- Get 'em moved out of here.
- Wait. Agent Stukowski,

21:26.591 --> 21:29.360
we're trying to help.
Okay, this is weird.

21:29.428 --> 21:30.961
Well, we specialize
in weird.

21:31.029 --> 21:34.398
We can help you.
We--we know stuff.

21:34.466 --> 21:36.734
All right, but only because
I've got a boss

21:36.802 --> 21:37.869
that wants answers yesterday.

21:37.936 --> 21:39.437
What do you know?
Quid pro quo.

21:39.504 --> 21:41.705
- Depends.
- See, you are so cute

21:41.773 --> 21:44.308
when you open up.
I will shoot you right here.

21:44.376 --> 21:45.977
Okay, look, we think

21:46.044 --> 21:47.812
there might be something
going on down at the Regalton.

21:47.879 --> 21:49.814
Both victims were
vaguely connected to it.

21:49.882 --> 21:52.583
That's it? That's all?

21:52.651 --> 21:54.051
I'm sorry,
you got nothing to trade.

21:54.119 --> 21:55.619
So you don't know anything
about a bunch

21:55.687 --> 21:57.822
of bankers meeting there?
No. And I think it's time

21:57.889 --> 21:59.657
y'all got out of here.
You're lying.

21:59.724 --> 22:02.193
Agent <i>Jinks,</i> is it?

22:02.261 --> 22:04.795
I'm under strict orders
to sew this up,

22:04.863 --> 22:07.031
so that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

22:07.099 --> 22:10.267
Okay, look, I've got
a really bad feeling here,

22:10.335 --> 22:11.769
and I would hate
for your first time--

22:11.837 --> 22:13.971
Agent Lattimer,
my job is to make sure

22:14.039 --> 22:16.040
that this event goes off
without a hitch.

22:16.108 --> 22:17.775
And right now,
I already have two.

22:17.843 --> 22:21.912
- So there is a connection.
- Sew it up.

22:21.980 --> 22:24.648
These two out.

22:24.716 --> 22:26.184
You are adorable.

22:26.251 --> 22:28.352
I don't think she gets
your sense of humor either.

22:33.592 --> 22:37.728
Okay, I found it.

22:40.464 --> 22:42.799
Are you sure the lightning's
only gonna strike that rod?

22:44.935 --> 22:46.368
Mostly.

22:46.436 --> 22:48.670
Listen, listen, listen,
listen, listen.

22:48.738 --> 22:50.372
The statues of Zeus
Hera--

22:50.439 --> 22:52.006
the very ones that we've got
in the warehouse--

22:52.074 --> 22:53.274
those were the very statues
that were involved

22:53.341 --> 22:55.576
in the Battle
of Corpendium!

22:55.644 --> 22:57.945
Now, this is fantastic.
Picture the scene.

22:58.013 --> 22:59.546
It's 306 B.C.

22:59.614 --> 23:01.048
Yes, you were just a child,
but it's still so vivid.

23:01.116 --> 23:02.850
Can you just tell us about
the lightning already?

23:02.917 --> 23:04.351
These statues, Zeus and Hera,
they hated each other,

23:04.419 --> 23:07.288
and here's why--
Zeus married his sister Hera.

23:07.356 --> 23:09.257
Don't ask. They were Greek.

23:09.325 --> 23:11.927
Then Zeus tomcats
all over town.

23:11.995 --> 23:13.996
Upstairs at Olympus,
downstairs with the mortals.

23:14.064 --> 23:15.331
Got it.
Zeus was a man-slut.

23:15.399 --> 23:17.434
Then Hera found out
about it.

23:17.501 --> 23:18.502
And she made his life
miserable.

23:18.569 --> 23:19.936
And he <i>hated</i> her for it.

23:20.004 --> 23:21.638
Now he throws lightning bolts.

23:21.706 --> 23:23.441
God knows what else
he's gonna do.

23:23.508 --> 23:25.543
I mean, they're apart
for 2,300 years.

23:25.611 --> 23:27.078
Okay, so we need to
move one of them--

23:27.146 --> 23:28.346
To a safe place.

23:33.085 --> 23:35.620
- We need to do that now.
- Yeah.

23:35.688 --> 23:38.022
Look, just get us into
the shindig tonight.

23:38.090 --> 23:40.592
No. No, I'm sorry,
I can't do that.

23:40.660 --> 23:42.060
Look, you don't want
a bunch of dead bankers

23:42.128 --> 23:43.428
on your hands, do you?

23:43.495 --> 23:44.662
Agent Stukowski told us that--

23:44.730 --> 23:48.333
Mr. Benjamin Franklin
talks a lot louder

23:48.400 --> 23:49.467
than Agent Stukowski.

23:49.535 --> 23:51.069
What's that, Ben?

23:51.137 --> 23:53.471
You want to meet the bellman?
Oh, here you go.

23:53.505 --> 23:55.106
I gotta start keeping
receipts.

23:55.174 --> 23:57.342
- <i>Et tu, Brute?</i>
- What?

23:57.409 --> 23:59.678
<i>Kai su teknon.</i>
It's not a name.

23:59.745 --> 24:00.812
It's ancient Greek
for <i>et tu, Brute?</i>

24:00.880 --> 24:01.980
From Shakespeare's
<i>Julius Caesar.</i>

24:02.048 --> 24:03.281
Right, right.

24:03.349 --> 24:05.483
And Antony
of <i>Antony and Cleopatra.</i>

24:05.551 --> 24:07.786
Ha, ha! Look at me
using my high school English.

24:07.854 --> 24:09.287
We need to do some research
on those plays, and fast.

24:09.355 --> 24:11.957
No, not necessary.
I know where we can learn more

24:12.024 --> 24:14.726
than we ever wanted to know
about Mr. Walter Shakespeare.

24:27.239 --> 24:30.775
Ophelia, pray tell.
How doth milady?

24:35.861 --> 24:37.194
You're wasting your time,
Pete, okay?

24:37.543 --> 24:40.236
I made my decision, and
I don't work there anymore.

24:40.237 --> 24:42.405
I don't know what you think
that you're doing here.

24:42.473 --> 24:43.906
If you could just get
your nose

24:43.974 --> 24:45.541
out of your own butt
for five seconds,

24:45.609 --> 24:46.943
I could explain it.

24:47.010 --> 24:49.179
I just--
I have some questions.

24:49.246 --> 24:51.347
- Well, you could have phone.
- Okay, fine.

24:51.415 --> 24:53.283
The reason I'm here is
you're an expert

24:53.350 --> 24:54.250
on what I'm dealing with
right now.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.119
No, I'm not, Pete. Okay?

24:56.187 --> 24:57.687
I'm no longer an expert

24:57.755 --> 25:00.190
on things that make you old
in two seconds

25:00.258 --> 25:03.026
or electrify your spine
or--

25:03.094 --> 25:05.028
or create ice-age volcanoes.

25:05.096 --> 25:06.997
Okay, now I am just
an expert on books.

25:07.064 --> 25:08.732
Exactly. Shakespeare.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.167
And correct me if I'm wrong,

25:10.234 --> 25:13.036
which I know
you love to do,

25:13.104 --> 25:14.938
but you're an expert
on the Bird of Avon, right?

25:17.775 --> 25:19.309
Bard.

25:19.377 --> 25:21.411
It's the <i>Bard</i> of Avon,
Pete.

25:21.479 --> 25:23.246
See, you're already
helping.

25:23.314 --> 25:24.681
You know what,
just please--

25:24.749 --> 25:26.950
just please, okay?
Come on, Myka.

25:27.018 --> 25:28.752
Look, if I had quit
and left you there,

25:28.820 --> 25:29.920
and you were looking
for an artifact

25:29.987 --> 25:32.188
about football or porn,
I'd help you.

25:32.256 --> 25:33.523
Just try a library, okay?

25:33.591 --> 25:36.326
Man, is it hard
to park around here.

25:36.393 --> 25:39.162
Hi, can I--
can I help you?

25:39.230 --> 25:41.030
Yeah. This is Steve,
my new Myka.

25:41.098 --> 25:43.199
Steve, the old Myka.

25:43.267 --> 25:44.734
- Oh.
- Oh.

25:44.801 --> 25:47.103
- Oh.
- Right. Myka, hi.

25:47.170 --> 25:51.441
Hi. So I take it
he's mentioned me?

25:51.508 --> 25:54.278
No, not really...

25:54.345 --> 25:57.215
We need your help.

25:57.282 --> 25:59.985
Fine.
What do you need?

26:00.053 --> 26:02.054
- Oh, really, you'll help <i>him?</i>
- Pete...

26:02.121 --> 26:04.256
- Ah...
- The bodies are piling up.

26:04.324 --> 26:06.125
Each of the victims said

26:06.193 --> 26:07.794
a Shakespeare line
before they died.

26:07.861 --> 26:09.962
One said <i>"Kai su teknon."</i>
That's Greek for <i>et tu, Brute?</i>

26:10.030 --> 26:12.097
Right. Yeah.

26:12.165 --> 26:14.800
Uh, and the other one said,
"Oh, Antony..."

26:14.868 --> 26:16.702
"Nay, I will take thee too."

26:16.770 --> 26:20.506
- Wow, how did you know that?
- I told you.

26:20.574 --> 26:24.309
Well, they're Cleopatra's
last words before she died.

26:24.377 --> 26:28.814
This says that a snakebite was
the suspected cause of death?

26:28.881 --> 26:29.815
This pose?
I know.

26:29.882 --> 26:31.116
We can't figure it out either.

26:31.183 --> 26:32.183
And there weren't
any snakes anywhere.

26:32.251 --> 26:33.418
Definitely not
a Russell's Viper.

26:33.486 --> 26:36.688
- <i>The Lost Folio.</i>
- The what?

26:36.756 --> 26:38.624
The pose.

26:38.691 --> 26:40.860
The positions that
the dead people were in.

26:40.928 --> 26:42.495
I've seen it before.
I was just looking--

26:42.563 --> 26:46.266
here. Here it is.

26:46.334 --> 26:49.002
It's <i>The Lost Folio.</i>
How do you lose a folio?

26:49.070 --> 26:50.771
What's a folio?
It's a book.

26:50.839 --> 26:52.372
Why not say book?

26:52.440 --> 26:56.143
Because it's not a book,
it's a folio.

26:56.211 --> 27:00.047
Does this look familiar?
It's Julius Caesar.

27:00.115 --> 27:01.482
Hey, <i>hey,</i> hey.
He's in the same position.

27:01.549 --> 27:03.350
Well, this--this book is
just a reproduction.

27:03.418 --> 27:07.321
The original disappeared
around 400 years ago.

27:07.388 --> 27:10.223
It was supposedly cursed
by this actor

27:10.291 --> 27:13.160
who desperately wanted to act
in Shakespeare's plays,

27:13.227 --> 27:14.427
but Shakespeare never
hired him.

27:14.495 --> 27:16.095
Apparently he couldn't
remember his lines,

27:16.163 --> 27:18.731
so he kept improvising.
That'll piss a writer off.

27:18.799 --> 27:21.134
Well, I don't get
the connection.

27:21.202 --> 27:22.869
How can a book do anything?

27:22.937 --> 27:25.605
Well, the original was
believed to have been cursed

27:25.673 --> 27:28.608
by the actor--there were several
deaths linked to it.

27:28.676 --> 27:31.244
If somebody's gotten ahold
of it, they could be using it.

27:31.312 --> 27:33.647
If we could dig up the history
of <i>The Lost Folio,</i>

27:33.714 --> 27:35.081
maybe we could
connect the dots--

27:35.149 --> 27:38.252
Okay. Thank you,
kind citizen.

27:38.319 --> 27:41.221
And your country thanks you
for the loan of this book.

27:41.289 --> 27:43.657
- You can't just take--
- I'll send you the check.

27:43.724 --> 27:45.325
No need for you
to get involved any further.

27:45.393 --> 27:46.593
Jinksy, let's go back
to Denver.

27:46.661 --> 27:49.629
Oh, and, uh...

27:49.697 --> 27:52.265
definitely don't need
any more of your help.

27:59.574 --> 28:01.575
Okay, uh...

28:01.642 --> 28:02.909
Well, thanks.

28:02.977 --> 28:05.378
I'm just gonna need the...
Oh, oh, oh.

28:05.446 --> 28:08.281
Yes, yes. Here.

28:08.349 --> 28:09.715
You know,
if it makes a difference,

28:09.783 --> 28:11.250
he was lying.

28:19.494 --> 28:20.795
Are you talking about
Shakespeare?

28:20.862 --> 28:22.463
Because Cromwell destroyed
most of the folios.

28:22.531 --> 28:23.765
I've never even heard
of a lost one.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.801
Hey, how is she?
Does she miss us?

28:25.868 --> 28:27.469
Is she coming back?
I don't think so.

28:27.537 --> 28:30.973
Myka said some crappy actor
made it for Shakespeare,

28:31.040 --> 28:32.908
then he cursed it,
now it kills people.

28:32.975 --> 28:34.309
Yeah, I will have an answer
for you

28:34.377 --> 28:35.510
by the time
you get back to Denver.

28:35.578 --> 28:37.445
All right,
you know how to find us.

28:37.513 --> 28:42.317
Kirk out!
Oh, and...Spock too.

28:48.657 --> 28:50.758
Claudia, get over here.
We're in a public place.

28:50.826 --> 28:54.262
Claudia, turn it on.
Turn it <i>on,</i> Claudia!

28:54.330 --> 28:56.298
Do you think griping at me
will enhance my speed?

28:56.366 --> 28:57.899
Just do it.
Turn it on.

28:57.967 --> 29:00.436
Okay, and that's it?
Yeah, that's it.

29:00.504 --> 29:02.271
If there's any problem at all,
anybody tries to move him,

29:02.339 --> 29:03.573
we'll hear about it
in the office.

29:03.641 --> 29:04.741
All right, good.
Let's get out of here.

29:04.809 --> 29:05.708
These plants are
making me nervous,

29:05.776 --> 29:09.312
and that one is
staring at me.

29:12.883 --> 29:14.317
Okay, so wait.
What did Buddha say

29:14.384 --> 29:15.651
about happiness again?

29:15.719 --> 29:17.252
That the secret is
to want what you have,

29:17.320 --> 29:18.654
and not what you don't have.

29:18.721 --> 29:19.955
Yeah, but if I had
what I wanted,

29:20.023 --> 29:21.990
there'd be nothing to do.

29:22.058 --> 29:24.025
This is gonna be
a longer discussion, I think.

29:24.093 --> 29:27.929
Okay, so our bad guy
takes out a reporter

29:27.996 --> 29:29.697
who's doing a story
on a secret bankers' meeting.

29:29.765 --> 29:30.798
That way it stays secret,
right?

29:30.866 --> 29:31.899
Nobody gets scared away.

29:31.967 --> 29:33.601
But...then he takes out
a waiter.

29:33.669 --> 29:36.237
Maybe it gets him access
to the event tonight.

29:36.305 --> 29:38.439
I think we should--

29:38.507 --> 29:40.509
- Uh-oh.
- What?

29:40.577 --> 29:43.179
- I got a bad feeling.
- What do you mean?

29:43.246 --> 29:45.548
Vibes. I get these things.

29:45.615 --> 29:46.882
Agent Jinks?

29:46.950 --> 29:49.385
This was at the bell desk
for you.

29:49.453 --> 29:52.155
Who knows that I'm here?

29:52.222 --> 29:53.522
I've got a really
bad feeling.

29:53.590 --> 29:55.757
Hey--

29:55.825 --> 29:58.193
Steve, no! Steve!

29:58.261 --> 30:01.330
Steve, what's going on, man?
You can't breathe?

30:01.398 --> 30:02.798
All right,old on, man.
Hold on.

30:02.866 --> 30:04.700
Stay with me, man.
Hey, hey, you hear me?

30:04.768 --> 30:06.835
You're gonna be okay,
all right? Stay with me. Hey!

30:06.903 --> 30:09.504
- Pete! Pete, the folio.
- What?

30:09.572 --> 30:12.474
"Commend me to my kind lord:
O, farewell."

30:12.542 --> 30:13.742
Make him say it.
Make him say it fast.

30:13.810 --> 30:15.844
Commend me to my kind lord:
O, farewell.

30:15.911 --> 30:18.046
Say it, Steve.

30:18.114 --> 30:20.815
Commend me to my kind lord...

30:20.883 --> 30:22.317
O, farewell.

30:29.125 --> 30:30.726
Congratulations.

30:30.793 --> 30:33.062
You were almost killed
by an artifact.

30:33.087 --> 30:35.033
You are now officially
a Warehouse Agent.

30:40.943 --> 30:42.577
Oh, son of a bitch.

30:42.645 --> 30:45.514
You come after <i>my</i> team?
No. No way.

30:45.582 --> 30:46.748
Game on, man. I am--

30:46.816 --> 30:49.384
I am gonna
Tesla this guy sterile!

30:49.452 --> 30:52.220
- Pete, lobby. People.
- What the hell was that?

30:52.288 --> 30:55.123
Othello. He smothered
Desdemona with a pillow.

30:55.191 --> 30:57.159
<i>Julius Caesar,</i>
<i>Antony and Cleopatra?</i>

30:57.226 --> 30:59.527
Look, I did some digging
in the history

30:59.595 --> 31:03.832
of <i>The Lost Folio,</i>
and listen to this.

31:03.899 --> 31:06.634
"The first errant fool
that touches the page

31:06.702 --> 31:08.969
"shall loos'th himself
in the image therein,

31:09.037 --> 31:10.237
"and shall be curs'd
to live the death

31:10.305 --> 31:12.573
that is therein depicteth."

31:12.641 --> 31:14.708
- It means--
- No, no, I know what it means.

31:14.776 --> 31:16.543
First guy that touches
the picture dies that way.

31:16.611 --> 31:19.179
It get it, it's just
fancy words make me sleepy.

31:19.247 --> 31:21.781
"Yet he who utters
the dying breath

31:21.849 --> 31:23.716
"may then be spared
the errant death.

31:23.784 --> 31:26.219
"But breath be spoke
before the flame,

31:26.287 --> 31:28.388
or death shall take him
all the same."

31:28.456 --> 31:30.190
Sleepy, sleepy.

31:30.258 --> 31:31.825
The first two victims

31:31.893 --> 31:34.528
spoke the last words
their character said

31:34.596 --> 31:36.430
<i>after</i> the engraving
burst into flames.

31:36.498 --> 31:37.965
You have to say it before.
That's the only way out.

31:38.033 --> 31:39.600
Is there any connection
between the victims?

31:39.668 --> 31:43.470
Only this hotel and a bunch
of investment bankers

31:43.538 --> 31:44.805
who are meeting here
later tonight.

31:44.873 --> 31:46.140
So you think
they're the targets?

31:46.208 --> 31:48.209
- Well, we don't know.
- Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

31:48.277 --> 31:50.946
I'm sorry, are you back in?

31:51.013 --> 31:52.714
Because, what, you're just
all interested now,

31:52.782 --> 31:55.784
so you're just back in?
No, I'm just here to help.

31:55.852 --> 31:58.721
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Mykes,
but you can't just

31:58.789 --> 32:00.856
waltz in and out like that--
we don't need a consultant.

32:00.924 --> 32:02.157
Oh, don't you?
'Cause I'm pretty sure that

32:02.225 --> 32:04.393
if I didn't get here in time...
Oh, really?

32:04.460 --> 32:06.461
Because if you hadn't
walked out like that

32:06.529 --> 32:07.996
in the first place--
It wasn't the easiest decision

32:08.064 --> 32:10.565
that I ever had to make...
Well, I never had any idea--

32:10.633 --> 32:12.667
- Hey!
- What?

32:12.734 --> 32:14.068
I'm pretty okay
with her being back

32:14.135 --> 32:15.569
since she just saved my life
and all.

32:15.637 --> 32:17.471
So maybe you two can work
on your repressed sexual tension

32:17.539 --> 32:19.773
sometime when we don't have
a book running around

32:19.841 --> 32:21.575
trying to suffocate people.
Maybe our next step

32:21.643 --> 32:23.076
should be to check the tapes
and see

32:23.144 --> 32:25.279
who left that envelope
for me to die from.

32:25.346 --> 32:27.615
Yes, we will finish
this conversation later.

32:27.682 --> 32:31.319
- We'll do that later.
- Oh, man...

32:31.386 --> 32:33.153
It had to have been
within the last few hours.

32:33.221 --> 32:34.488
We weren't gone that long.

32:34.556 --> 32:36.757
Ugh, if I give that bellman
any more money,

32:36.825 --> 32:38.859
he's gonna have to claim me
on his tax return.

32:38.927 --> 32:41.162
There.
That's the envelope.

32:41.230 --> 32:45.967
That guy is dropping it off
at the desk.

32:46.034 --> 32:47.468
Okay, well,
so we've got a who.

32:47.536 --> 32:48.770
We need a why.

32:48.837 --> 32:50.771
Create a panic
in the financial markets,

32:50.839 --> 32:52.173
take advantage?

32:52.240 --> 32:54.308
We gotta get
the Wall Street guys

32:54.375 --> 32:56.143
to cancel their
back-patting ceremony tonight.

32:56.211 --> 32:57.778
By telling them what,
that Shakespeare's <i>Lost Folio</i>

32:57.846 --> 32:59.046
is gonna kill them?

32:59.113 --> 33:00.914
I know it's true
and I don't believe it.

33:00.982 --> 33:03.050
Plus, we'll never get
Stukowski to agree.

33:03.118 --> 33:05.686
Next time she sees <i>him,</i>
she'll have him shot.

33:05.754 --> 33:07.955
Oh, I see you've already
worked your magic.

33:08.023 --> 33:09.824
Why do you automatically
assume it's my fault?

33:09.892 --> 33:13.461
- Whose fault is it?
- Mine.

33:13.529 --> 33:19.700
But we might be able to use
uptight Sally to our advantage.

33:23.071 --> 33:25.305
But I thought Buddhists
were supposed to let go

33:25.373 --> 33:27.074
of all worldly possessions.

33:27.141 --> 33:29.709
No, it's about not letting
your possessions possess you.

33:29.777 --> 33:31.144
See, we believe
that you can only lose

33:31.212 --> 33:33.012
what you refuse
to let go of.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.014
You know what,
that is so true

33:35.082 --> 33:37.216
because I always lose the things
I really like,

33:37.284 --> 33:39.018
and I never lose the things
I don't care about.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.519
Like, my mom would say,
"Pete,

33:40.587 --> 33:42.621
if your head wasn't glued
to your neck, you'd probably..."

33:42.688 --> 33:45.124
That's not the achievement
of self awakening

33:45.192 --> 33:47.927
the Buddha was talking about.
You didn't know him.

33:47.995 --> 33:50.664
Ladies and gentlemen,
why don't we get things started.

33:50.731 --> 33:52.533
I'd like to introduce
our panel.

33:52.600 --> 33:53.901
I'm sure some of you
know them--

33:53.968 --> 33:57.772
Jim Kouvell,
and Doug Alps, from New York.

34:04.680 --> 34:07.815
There, that's him.

34:07.883 --> 34:09.384
- You sure?
- Trust me.

34:09.452 --> 34:12.085
I got a bad feeling.

34:12.154 --> 34:15.190
- Lattimer.
- Agent Sally!

34:15.257 --> 34:16.558
I was hoping
to run into you tonight.

34:16.626 --> 34:19.293
- Save me a dance?
- Boys, please cuff them.

34:19.362 --> 34:20.828
- Take them out.
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

34:20.896 --> 34:22.563
Aren't we all
on the same team here?

34:22.632 --> 34:24.366
Are we?
'Cause my team's job

34:24.434 --> 34:26.368
is to make sure the this event
goes along smoothly.

34:26.436 --> 34:32.308
Whew, man, is it hot in here
or is it just you, <i>Sally?</i>

34:32.376 --> 34:34.844
Myka, now!
Oh! Oh...

34:44.221 --> 34:46.255
Gertrude.
"The drink!

34:46.322 --> 34:48.491
The drink! I am poisoned!"
Say it.

34:48.559 --> 34:51.661
The drink! The drink!
I am poisoned!

34:52.795 --> 34:54.163
Claudius.

34:54.230 --> 34:56.797
"Oh, yet defend me friends,
I am but hurt."

34:56.866 --> 34:59.501
Say it. Say, "Oh, yet
defend me friends..."

34:59.569 --> 35:01.569
- Oh, yet defend me friends...
- "I am but hurt."

35:01.637 --> 35:04.006
I am but hurt.

35:04.073 --> 35:07.977
Hamlet.
Uh...Oh, God...

35:08.044 --> 35:10.079
"The rest is silence!" Damn it,
say "The rest is silence!"

35:10.147 --> 35:14.318
The rest is silence!

35:14.385 --> 35:18.723
Bring it! Bring it!

35:18.791 --> 35:21.426
- Hey, boss!
- Look, fire!

35:27.332 --> 35:32.068
All right, all right!
You guys have had enough.

35:43.981 --> 35:48.251
No charge, ladies.

35:48.319 --> 35:50.420
Myka!

36:04.036 --> 36:05.170
Thank you.

36:05.237 --> 36:07.205
Be careful.

36:09.341 --> 36:16.315
♪ ♪

36:16.383 --> 36:19.752
Well, there she goes again.

36:19.820 --> 36:22.221
Found the last pages
of <i>The Folio</i> in a room,

36:22.288 --> 36:23.789
but the guy was long gone.

36:23.857 --> 36:27.025
We know what he looks like,
so it's only a matter of time.

36:27.092 --> 36:29.894
Listen, Lattimer, I think
you are a first-class jerk,

36:29.962 --> 36:31.896
obnoxious, unprofessional
to the core.

36:31.963 --> 36:34.531
Shouldn't you be
on one knee to do this?

36:34.599 --> 36:39.202
But you were right.
So...Thanks.

36:39.270 --> 36:41.471
Oh, and, Lattimer,
if you ever fly

36:41.539 --> 36:43.440
into the Denver area again,
let me know.

36:43.508 --> 36:45.676
I'll have you shot
in the airport.

36:49.281 --> 36:51.382
It is shocking
how much she wants me.

36:51.450 --> 36:53.585
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, it is.

36:53.653 --> 36:55.153
Stud.

36:58.892 --> 37:00.860
I am a stud.

37:09.335 --> 37:10.802
All quiet
on the eastern front?

37:10.870 --> 37:13.738
- Calm and peaceful.
- Like a statue should be.

37:16.041 --> 37:18.475
Wow...

37:18.543 --> 37:20.810
That's really...

37:24.682 --> 37:27.618
Annoying.
Artie.

37:37.430 --> 37:38.563
Thank you.

37:38.631 --> 37:41.600
God. Oh...

37:41.668 --> 37:44.836
I'd forgotten about that.

37:44.904 --> 37:49.875
You were so helpful
during our recent mission.

37:49.942 --> 37:51.309
I just wanted
to thank you in person.

37:51.377 --> 37:54.012
You're welcome.

37:54.079 --> 37:57.415
I'm...glad I could help.

37:57.482 --> 37:59.583
Really.

37:59.651 --> 38:02.252
There's someone
I want you to speak with.

38:03.921 --> 38:05.755
Hello, Myka.

38:07.458 --> 38:09.558
Mrs. Frederic,
why would you bring her here?

38:09.626 --> 38:11.193
She can't hurt you,
Myka.

38:11.261 --> 38:14.230
She can't hurt anyone.
Trust me.

38:14.297 --> 38:16.365
I'll leave you two alone.

38:22.006 --> 38:25.575
Myka...
You hate me for what I did.

38:25.643 --> 38:28.245
You hate the warehouse
for what it did to you.

38:28.312 --> 38:33.351
No. No, I don't.

38:35.687 --> 38:37.621
We became friends because
we're alike in many ways.

38:37.689 --> 38:40.424
Except that I--

38:40.492 --> 38:41.959
I didn't want
to destroy the world

38:42.027 --> 38:44.529
and kill everybody in it.

38:44.597 --> 38:49.067
I'm not proud
of what happened,

38:49.135 --> 38:52.171
or that it drove you away
from the Warehouse.

38:54.641 --> 38:56.376
100 years ago,
I went into the bronzer

38:56.443 --> 38:58.144
filled with hate.

38:58.212 --> 39:00.714
It grew inside me
like a cancer.

39:00.748 --> 39:02.949
All I thought about was
what I'd lost,

39:03.017 --> 39:07.053
what the Warehouse had
taken from me, turned me into.

39:07.120 --> 39:09.888
Be careful, Myka.

39:09.956 --> 39:12.590
Hate so easily
turns into fear.

39:12.658 --> 39:15.159
Don't walk away
from your truth.

39:15.226 --> 39:17.094
That's why you're here.

39:17.162 --> 39:19.029
I haven't actually
come here.

39:34.347 --> 39:38.284
So what, you're some sort of
holographic projection?

39:38.351 --> 39:42.121
I'm...being held.

39:42.189 --> 39:46.192
I don't know where or how.

39:46.259 --> 39:50.062
They can, it seems,
transport my consciousness.

39:50.129 --> 39:53.198
Wish I'd thought of that.

39:55.968 --> 39:58.035
Please think about
what I've said.

40:20.606 --> 40:22.206
So you're saying
my aura's changing color.

40:22.274 --> 40:24.408
Well, what I want to know is
<i>why</i> my aura's changing color.

40:24.476 --> 40:25.476
Well, because--

40:29.114 --> 40:31.047
Oh, my God!
Squeal of delight.

40:32.950 --> 40:35.551
- I missed you.
- Oh, you have no idea!

40:35.619 --> 40:37.553
Myka, you're back.

40:37.622 --> 40:39.189
You are back, right?

40:39.257 --> 40:41.057
- Yeah, I'm back.
- Okay, magic carpet.

40:41.125 --> 40:43.026
What do you do?
You try to get it going.

40:43.094 --> 40:45.429
I thought it would,
you know, just take off and--

40:46.932 --> 40:48.900
Hey.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.169
Hey.

40:51.237 --> 40:55.007
So does this mean
that I'm out of a job?

40:55.075 --> 40:58.810
Because I was just getting used
to Pete's <i>hilarious</i> jokes.

40:58.878 --> 41:01.213
The only way you leave
the Warehouse is feet first.

41:08.954 --> 41:10.221
Welcome back, then.

41:10.288 --> 41:12.489
Thanks.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.700
Good.

41:30.807 --> 41:32.275
Good.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.648
All right, let's get to it.

41:38.715 --> 41:40.049
There's still
a mysterious man in Denver,

41:40.117 --> 41:43.886
and we should all try
to find him, no?

41:43.953 --> 41:45.954
It is what we do.

41:55.265 --> 41:57.934
I don't think they saw me.
I had to leave <i>The Folio.</i>

41:58.001 --> 41:59.702
It's too dangerous
to go back.

41:59.770 --> 42:01.271
Their new operative
is Steven Jinks,

42:01.339 --> 42:03.174
a former ATF Agent.

42:03.241 --> 42:04.542
Bering and Lattimer were
working as a team.

42:04.610 --> 42:07.178
This may indicate that
she's returned to the Warehouse.

42:07.246 --> 42:08.746
I can follow up.

42:08.814 --> 42:11.082
No. No, you've done well.

42:11.150 --> 42:13.084
Now you need to disappear
for a while.

42:13.152 --> 42:15.520
Of course.
I'm just glad--
