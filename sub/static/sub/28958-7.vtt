<i>My name is Talon.</i>

00:01.302 --> 00:03.828
<i>I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.</i>

00:03.917 --> 00:06.425
<i>I escaped when Everit Dred
killed all my people.</i>

00:06.513 --> 00:08.987
<i>I cut off the points of my ears
to hide in plain sight.</i>

00:09.332 --> 00:11.464
<i>A tiny creature
lives inside me,</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:13.402
<i>passed to me
by my dying mother.</i>

00:13.490 --> 00:16.254
<i>It gives me the power to open
portals to another world</i>

00:16.341 --> 00:18.895
<i>and summon powerful demons
called Lu-Qiri.</i>

00:18.982 --> 00:21.175
<i>But I can only summon them
when I have their names,</i>

00:21.262 --> 00:23.395
<i>something that's proving
to be a challenge.</i>

00:23.482 --> 00:26.183
<i>The Prime Order wants me dead,
but I've found sanctuary</i>

00:26.271 --> 00:29.724
<i>at the farthest edge of the Realm
in a place known as the Outpost.</i>

00:29.971 --> 00:31.724
<i>Previously, on</i>
"The Outpost"...

00:31.812 --> 00:34.253
Take him,
and find me Talon.

00:34.425 --> 00:37.126
- What are you doing?
- If you rid of that demon for good,

00:37.214 --> 00:38.923
then I will pardon Zed
of his offenses.

00:39.011 --> 00:40.690
E-ja!

00:41.451 --> 00:43.321
Tobin has a cousin,
Milus Aegisford.

00:43.409 --> 00:46.173
He has men and lands
to rival Tobin's.

00:46.261 --> 00:47.925
The last time they met,
Tobin cut

00:48.013 --> 00:49.276
- Milus wide open.
- Oh.

00:49.364 --> 00:51.002
You know, there is
something else you could do for me.

00:51.089 --> 00:53.125
Make peace
with your cousin Milus.

00:53.212 --> 00:55.415
Never. So there's still
a traitor in our midst.

00:55.502 --> 00:57.595
I'll get on the case,
and we'll hang the bastard.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.573
You got a bird yesterday.
Who was it from?

00:59.661 --> 01:02.605
Plaguelings avoid sunlight,
and that could be a clue for the cure.

01:02.698 --> 01:05.165
You are now
The Blade of The Three.

01:05.253 --> 01:07.761
My purpose is clear.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.690
Garret!
I thought you were dead.

01:23.815 --> 01:25.159
What are you doing?

01:25.925 --> 01:30.269
Stopping you from fulfilling
your so-called prophecy

01:30.494 --> 01:32.401
to summon the slayers of men.

01:32.565 --> 01:34.065
What are you talking about?

01:34.153 --> 01:36.503
Wherever you go, people die!

01:38.440 --> 01:41.368
I've done nothing but try
and help you and Gwynn.

01:41.479 --> 01:43.644
Do not speak
of the false queen!

01:43.732 --> 01:46.526
- False queen?
- I will deal with her next.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.817
- Why are you doing this?
- I cannot let you live.

01:52.937 --> 01:54.667
You'll destroy us all.

01:58.092 --> 02:01.355
- I am your friend!
- You are no one's friend!

02:03.534 --> 02:05.337
What have they done to you?

02:05.425 --> 02:06.722
They showed me the truth.

02:06.817 --> 02:10.384
They lie.
The Prime Order lies, Garret!

02:11.112 --> 02:12.722
Look at me.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.769
I don't believe
you can kill me.

02:19.582 --> 02:20.987
Hail to The Three.

04:18.011 --> 04:20.930
It was a reasonable demand
to show your influence.

04:21.017 --> 04:23.615
Milus was the obvious choice.

04:23.808 --> 04:25.868
My father's going to
rise from the grave

04:25.956 --> 04:28.417
- and break every bone in me.
- Nonsense.

04:28.589 --> 04:30.391
You sent our offer
to make amends,

04:30.479 --> 04:31.610
like a reasonable ruler.

04:31.698 --> 04:33.602
An offer that he can't
possibly refuse.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.315
It's like I got down on my
knees and I licked his boots.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.298
If it works, it's worth it.

04:38.386 --> 04:40.188
Your wounded pride
will be restored

04:40.299 --> 04:42.213
when your son
is king of the Realm.

04:42.643 --> 04:44.050
It's hard to think
that far ahead

04:44.138 --> 04:45.792
when you're licking boots.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.998
It was a ridiculous feud
in the first place.

04:49.344 --> 04:51.240
Don't you think you've done
and said enough?

04:51.396 --> 04:54.644
Just shut up and leave me to my shame,
and hope my men don't hack him to pieces

04:54.732 --> 04:57.560
the moment he shows
his bastard face around here!

05:02.517 --> 05:05.864
You know, you've picked a hell of
a time for me to quit drinking.

05:17.890 --> 05:20.142
Maybe she wishes
you had a beard like mine.

05:20.230 --> 05:21.948
Women like a beard
tickling them when they kiss.

05:22.035 --> 05:24.598
Oh, really? Is that so, Munt?
How many women have you kissed?

05:24.686 --> 05:26.322
Ah, plenty.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.291
Um... one.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.982
Yeah, Mum.

05:30.075 --> 05:31.921
- Just Mum, actually.
- That's what I thought.

05:32.009 --> 05:34.041
Anyway, I don't think it has
anything to do with my kissing,

05:34.128 --> 05:35.258
thank you very much.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.376
Tell me what happened,
every juicy bit.

05:37.464 --> 05:40.190
There's no juicy bits, Munt.
It's just that I said...

05:40.278 --> 05:42.026
You know, I went to
give her some flowers

05:42.114 --> 05:44.393
and then I said
there'd be kissing.

05:44.748 --> 05:46.427
It could be the kissing.

05:48.150 --> 05:51.045
Hey! Hey!
Get him away from me!

05:51.133 --> 05:52.374
Are you cured?

05:52.462 --> 05:54.505
You're cured!
How do you feel?

05:54.593 --> 05:56.226
Please!
Please let me go.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.594
Open up! Open up!

05:59.969 --> 06:01.866
Munt, I was right.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.237
The sun cured her.

06:03.325 --> 06:05.991
But if the sun cured her,

06:06.079 --> 06:08.829
why not the others, huh?

06:12.186 --> 06:14.928
Lady, tell me everything
that happened.

06:15.023 --> 06:16.702
I don't remember much,

06:16.790 --> 06:19.561
just choking on that thing,
and now I'm here.

06:20.204 --> 06:21.217
Aah!

06:21.305 --> 06:23.585
Munt, let the lady go.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.593
- Are you sure?
- I am sure. Let her go.

06:25.681 --> 06:28.468
- I don't want to get pricked...
- Now!

06:29.084 --> 06:31.812
Hey.

06:31.900 --> 06:37.203
Why her and not the others?
What's different about her?

06:37.976 --> 06:40.094
Is it that she's a woman?

06:48.774 --> 06:52.609
Munt, these flowers only seem
to open up in the daytime.

06:52.986 --> 06:55.218
I think we could be
on to something here.

06:55.715 --> 06:59.554
Yes, this changes everything,
don't it?

07:02.469 --> 07:06.117
Lady, when's the last time

07:06.205 --> 07:08.937
you paid your taxes?

07:09.025 --> 07:11.210
- Eh?
- Yeah.

07:11.396 --> 07:14.687
- Have you got money now?
- Munt, leave her alone.

07:35.350 --> 07:37.975
- Aah! Aah!
- Munt!

07:38.561 --> 07:41.567
- Why did you bite me?
- Why did you grab me like that?

07:41.654 --> 07:43.444
Janzo sent me to get you.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.157
Why didn't you just tap me on the
shoulder and say Janzo wants to see me?

07:46.244 --> 07:48.584
He wanted to surprise you
with a romantic dinner.

07:48.746 --> 07:50.779
Dinner?
It's the middle of the day.

07:50.867 --> 07:53.608
I-I don't know, I thought
if I covered your eyes,

07:53.696 --> 07:55.155
it would help
with the surprise.

07:55.243 --> 07:58.147
And if I told you it was me,
you'd know Janzo sent me.

07:58.235 --> 08:00.678
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever...

08:01.756 --> 08:04.592
Forget about it.
I know you meant well.

08:05.523 --> 08:07.303
Will you act surprised
when you see Janzo?

08:07.500 --> 08:10.514
Yes, I'll act surprised.

08:34.403 --> 08:36.436
This is such a nice surprise.

08:38.634 --> 08:43.053
It's probably not as good as what the
Queen's kitchen serves you, but, uh...

08:45.528 --> 08:48.530
But I got the best of what
the Outpost has to offer.

08:48.618 --> 08:50.959
It's perfect, Janzo.

08:51.855 --> 08:53.375
You're perfect.

09:00.224 --> 09:03.897
Do you know every morning
when I wake up,

09:04.110 --> 09:06.076
I think that
I'm still dreaming.

09:06.494 --> 09:08.936
And then when I realize
that I'm not,

09:09.435 --> 09:11.053
I just can't stop smiling.

09:11.161 --> 09:12.691
You don't have to say that.

09:14.216 --> 09:15.600
But it's true.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.928
Overlap the strapping.
It makes it stronger.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.123
Lord Tobin,

09:31.265 --> 09:32.756
I brought some food
for the workers.

09:32.844 --> 09:34.272
Set it over there.

09:34.387 --> 09:37.706
Get the strapping wetter.
It tightens as it dries.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.131
- Oh, Your Maj...
- Shh.

09:41.321 --> 09:42.864
What are you doing here?

09:42.982 --> 09:44.241
Take a break with me.

09:44.329 --> 09:45.905
You should eat something.

09:46.469 --> 09:48.826
Uh, finish up this side.

09:48.969 --> 09:50.569
I'll be back.

10:01.206 --> 10:03.342
It's unfermented.
I'm sorry.

10:03.460 --> 10:05.186
And you're welcome.

10:05.655 --> 10:07.969
Thank you, I guess.

10:19.454 --> 10:20.959
What's in this?

10:21.047 --> 10:23.316
Well, there's, um, boar leg.

10:23.404 --> 10:24.592
- Huh.
- Salt.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.657
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, let's see, um...

10:26.744 --> 10:28.687
- Lots of carmac. Yeah.
- Yes, carmac.

10:28.774 --> 10:30.820
- Mm-hmm.
- I went to the kitchen and made it myself.

10:30.907 --> 10:33.006
- Oh.
- Oh?

10:33.535 --> 10:36.162
Oh, it's horrible,
isn't it?

10:36.866 --> 10:38.350
I've eaten worse.

10:38.562 --> 10:40.741
I ate, um,
rancid venison once.

10:41.919 --> 10:44.035
That's not funny.
I made that for you.

10:44.123 --> 10:46.491
It's a good thing
you have people cook for you.

10:47.599 --> 10:50.537
As Queen,
I order you to stop laughing.

10:52.034 --> 10:53.496
Right, that's it.
Back to work.

10:53.584 --> 10:54.803
Come on now.

10:54.891 --> 10:56.064
It's not all that bad.

10:56.152 --> 10:57.350
I'm eating it, aren't I?

10:57.438 --> 10:59.889
Yes, I just wanted to show that
I appreciated your hard work.

10:59.977 --> 11:02.650
- Right.
- And that you risked your life for me,

11:02.738 --> 11:04.889
even though you just got
a good drubbing and, uh,

11:04.977 --> 11:07.045
actually didn't really
accomplish much.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.133
Mm.

11:16.722 --> 11:19.772
Yes. Carmac.

11:22.805 --> 11:27.025
So, um, tell me a bit more
about yourself.

11:27.504 --> 11:31.334
I've realized I hardly know a thing
about the girl I'm so crazy about.

11:32.583 --> 11:35.110
Um, I don't know what to say.

11:35.198 --> 11:38.769
Um, I lived in the Capital
in the poor quarter,

11:38.857 --> 11:41.120
and then, um, I came here.

11:41.808 --> 11:43.317
That's very brave of you,
isn't it,

11:43.404 --> 11:44.769
to be traveling so far?

11:44.859 --> 11:46.819
Did you come
in a trade caravan?

11:48.821 --> 11:52.253
- A military convoy, actually.
- Oh, that's awful.

11:52.799 --> 11:56.222
Sorry, I've heard about
how the soldiers on the roads

11:56.310 --> 11:58.073
treat young women.

11:59.143 --> 12:00.763
They didn't lay a hand on me.

12:02.178 --> 12:04.402
Well, that's fortunate then,
isn't it?

12:05.047 --> 12:07.222
Naya, I wasn't trying
to imply...

12:07.324 --> 12:08.764
Let's just talk
about something else.

12:09.941 --> 12:11.409
Of course.

12:11.511 --> 12:13.420
- I've upset you, haven't I?
- No.

12:13.698 --> 12:15.292
- It's nothing.
- Stupid.

12:15.451 --> 12:18.933
Don't do that.
You've done nothing wrong.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.456
Really?

12:20.749 --> 12:22.753
Because it feels, Naya, like...

12:22.841 --> 12:25.286
Like it's only around me
that you're ever upset.

12:25.374 --> 12:26.714
It's not you.

12:26.802 --> 12:29.350
I just show it
around you more because

12:29.438 --> 12:32.370
I'm comfortable with you
and I let my guard down.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.003
Well, that's good,
isn't it?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.477
Do you want to tell me
what's wrong, Naya?

12:39.838 --> 12:42.085
I promise that I'll do
anything I can to help you.

12:42.173 --> 12:43.649
I'm a bad person.

12:43.737 --> 12:45.610
- And I don't deserve you.
- What?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.329
I think it's me
that doesn't deserve you.

12:47.449 --> 12:50.312
I shouldn't have come.
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

12:50.461 --> 12:51.874
No, Naya. Naya, no.

12:51.962 --> 12:54.306
No, no, no, Naya! Stop!

12:54.394 --> 12:56.366
Please don't leave.
I'll do anything, okay?

12:56.454 --> 12:57.726
I can change.
I can be a different...

12:57.813 --> 12:59.103
Just stop it.
I've already told you

12:59.190 --> 13:00.473
it's nothing
you've done, Janzo.

13:00.561 --> 13:01.954
It's what I've done.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.325
What do you mean?
What have you done?

13:04.413 --> 13:06.579
Oh, Naya. Naya.

13:06.722 --> 13:08.085
Please don't cry.

13:08.292 --> 13:10.899
Naya, don't cry.
What could be so bad, hmm?

13:11.408 --> 13:12.860
Nothing. I have to go.

13:12.983 --> 13:14.313
Naya, please wait.

13:16.109 --> 13:17.569
You can trust me.

13:17.657 --> 13:20.085
I want to do anything I can
to help you.

13:20.755 --> 13:23.553
You won't want to after
I tell you what I've done.

13:23.982 --> 13:25.983
There's nothing
that you can say

13:26.138 --> 13:27.418
that would make me
stop loving you.

13:27.505 --> 13:30.643
How about this?
I'm the traitor.

13:32.962 --> 13:34.242
What do you mean?

13:37.284 --> 13:39.026
I'm the spy.

13:39.314 --> 13:41.344
I'm the one
who let Dred go free.

13:41.432 --> 13:42.954
No, you're not.

13:43.748 --> 13:45.711
No. No.

13:45.799 --> 13:47.957
I'm sorry, Janzo.
It was me.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.550
It was my fault Dred got away.

13:50.638 --> 13:52.317
It was my fault he killed Garret,
and it ill be my fault

13:52.404 --> 13:55.414
- when the Prime Order attacks.
- Naya, don't be so ridiculous.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.500
Please tell me
you're not being serious.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.134
No!

14:01.080 --> 14:02.539
Please don't hate me.

14:11.155 --> 14:13.070
Did someone make you do this?

14:13.791 --> 14:15.484
The Prime Order
threatened my family.

14:15.572 --> 14:17.820
The Prime Order threatened
everyone's family, Naya.

14:17.908 --> 14:20.304
Every man, every woman,
every child.

14:20.513 --> 14:22.566
If you really did
what you say you did,

14:22.654 --> 14:23.907
you could have cost
the lives of thousands.

14:23.994 --> 14:25.015
Do you realize that?

14:25.103 --> 14:26.945
Or even actually
the entire Realm?

14:35.392 --> 14:36.984
What have you told them?

14:38.516 --> 14:40.609
I only worked
for Ambassador Dred.

14:40.697 --> 14:42.679
He knows everything
up to when he left.

14:42.767 --> 14:44.070
He killed Garret.

14:44.158 --> 14:45.901
I'm sorry, Janzo.
I am so sorry.

14:45.989 --> 14:49.300
But you have to believe me,
I hate them more than anyone.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.591
How can you even say that when
you're the one who serves them?

14:52.679 --> 14:54.142
They have my mother
and my sister.

14:54.230 --> 14:55.851
So what?

14:56.591 --> 14:59.140
I can't believe
you would be so insensitive.

15:04.016 --> 15:05.851
I didn't mean it like that.

15:07.772 --> 15:10.320
But did you really think
that the Prime Order

15:10.408 --> 15:12.093
were just gonna go
and release your family?

15:12.181 --> 15:14.265
Hmm? Why would they, Naya?

15:14.353 --> 15:17.804
They're just gonna keep
asking you for more and more.

15:18.332 --> 15:20.750
The Prime Order used you.

15:21.346 --> 15:24.636
But now you're going to go and tell
Queen Rosmund everything that happened.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.013
Yes. And you're going
to tell her why...

15:27.101 --> 15:28.936
- No.
- and she's going to understand.-

15:29.024 --> 15:30.937
For what I've done,
she will take my head.

15:31.025 --> 15:33.106
- I will not let her.
- You can't stop her.

15:33.194 --> 15:36.039
I'm not going to let anyone
hurt you, do you hear me?

15:36.127 --> 15:37.991
You might spend
a lot of time in prison,

15:38.079 --> 15:39.970
- but I won't let anyone hurt...
- If I turn myself in,

15:40.058 --> 15:42.054
my mother and my sister
will surely die.

15:42.154 --> 15:43.742
They're probably already dead.

15:47.977 --> 15:49.804
Hey.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.565
If they are still alive,

15:51.730 --> 15:53.437
there's nothing more
you can do.

15:53.525 --> 15:56.093
But maybe the Queen can.

16:01.004 --> 16:03.177
You have to
turn yourself in, Naya.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.367
Right now.

16:06.156 --> 16:08.276
It's your only chance.

17:09.949 --> 17:11.682
Something wrong, Janzo?

17:11.770 --> 17:13.323
No, why?

17:13.411 --> 17:16.305
Because you're handling those
flowers like you hate them.

17:16.733 --> 17:18.867
I don't hate
the stupid flowers, Munt.

17:19.090 --> 17:22.195
All right.
Are you mad at me?

17:22.992 --> 17:25.540
Munt, shut up!

17:26.434 --> 17:28.986
Is this because I grabbed Naya
and dragged her into an alley?

17:29.074 --> 17:31.773
- What?
- What? No, nothing.

17:43.912 --> 17:47.712
Ah, you guys look beautiful.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.481
Janzo,
I need to talk to you.

18:12.584 --> 18:14.217
What are you
even doing here, Naya?

18:14.305 --> 18:15.708
You promised me
you would confess.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.559
I did. Um, sort of.

18:17.647 --> 18:19.180
I left a letter
explaining everything,

18:19.268 --> 18:22.129
But I have to go and help
my mother and sister if I can.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.967
And then I'll come back and
face my punishment, I swear it.

18:24.054 --> 18:25.599
I told you, they're
probably already dead.

18:25.686 --> 18:29.200
- Why don't you come with me?
- I can't come with you.

18:29.288 --> 18:30.997
Naya, my work is here.

18:31.133 --> 18:35.075
And do you know what? Actually,
even if I could come with you, I wouldn't.

18:35.308 --> 18:37.521
What you did was terrible.

18:37.726 --> 18:40.637
If you don't turn yourself in,
I'm never going to forgive you.

18:40.832 --> 18:44.082
She'll have me executed.
I know she will.

18:44.170 --> 18:47.041
- Is that what you want?
- Do you know why?

18:47.129 --> 18:49.887
Because I told you I would
never let that happen to you.

18:49.975 --> 18:52.090
But I'm also not going
to betray my friends.

18:52.804 --> 18:55.047
If you haven't
surrendered by noon,

18:55.423 --> 18:57.395
I'm going to tell
Gwynn myself.

18:59.699 --> 19:01.864
And if I leave
the Outpost instead?

19:01.952 --> 19:05.332
Mm. She'll probably
have you hunted down.

19:07.957 --> 19:09.754
Good-bye, Naya.

19:10.021 --> 19:11.184
No.

19:11.310 --> 19:13.680
Janzo, no. Please.

19:49.266 --> 19:52.549
Naya. Just the girl
I was looking for.

19:52.895 --> 19:55.551
What do you want?
I was just on the way to see my Queen.

19:55.638 --> 19:57.934
Oh, good.
We'll escort you.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.161
I know she'd want
a few words with you.

20:06.927 --> 20:08.364
You're under arrest.

20:18.178 --> 20:22.348
And this is true?
You confess to it?

20:23.692 --> 20:26.832
And it was you who released
Ambassador Dred?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.473
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Don't call me that.

20:30.164 --> 20:32.122
In your mouth, it's a mockery.

20:34.979 --> 20:37.161
In the name of every god, why?

20:38.928 --> 20:41.247
They have my mother
and sister.

20:41.825 --> 20:44.801
I was sent here under threat
that they would be killed.

20:45.233 --> 20:47.004
And once you came here?

20:47.870 --> 20:50.606
Once you came to know
the rightness of our cause?

20:50.872 --> 20:53.440
Once we were victorious
over Dred and his army,

20:53.528 --> 20:55.465
you didn't think
to join us then?

20:56.054 --> 21:00.122
I could have helped you.
Maybe even helped your family.

21:00.505 --> 21:02.798
But instead, you released
Ambassador Dred,

21:02.902 --> 21:06.207
who then killed my Garret.

21:08.312 --> 21:10.745
You are responsible
for the death of Garret Spears.

21:10.886 --> 21:14.112
If I had known he would have done that,
I wouldn't have set him free, I swear.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.238
And since then, you've been hiding like
a snake at my side ready to strike.

21:17.326 --> 21:20.080
No, Your Majesty.
I love you more than anything.

21:20.168 --> 21:22.817
You are guilty for treason
against the throne.

21:23.647 --> 21:25.051
Against me.

21:26.866 --> 21:28.653
Execute her at once.

21:32.084 --> 21:35.145
Um, Your Majesty?

21:35.383 --> 21:37.916
You know I'm a big fan
of executions.

21:38.004 --> 21:39.598
I really enjoy them,
but why the rush?

21:39.715 --> 21:43.182
We could just interrogate her,
find out what she knows,

21:43.270 --> 21:45.348
find out what she's told
the Prime Order.

21:45.536 --> 21:47.309
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

21:48.738 --> 21:53.016
So be it, but she must die
imminently after.

21:53.222 --> 21:57.575
Every breath she takes is an insult to
those who bled or died because of her.

21:57.864 --> 21:59.715
And double her guards

21:59.803 --> 22:02.715
in case she has any
co-conspirators among us.

22:04.491 --> 22:05.997
Get her out of my sight.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.004
No.

22:21.419 --> 22:24.778
Tobin, I am in your debt for
the apprehension of the traitor.

22:24.978 --> 22:28.041
I hope you'll understand if I show
my proper gratitude at another time.

22:28.315 --> 22:30.247
Right now,
I'd rather be alone.

22:31.035 --> 22:35.278
Of course, Rosmund.
I understand.

23:33.618 --> 23:36.423
I suspected you'd gone
to the other side.

23:36.940 --> 23:38.853
Yeah, well, never again.

23:39.066 --> 23:41.819
- How long was I gone?
- More than a day.

23:42.243 --> 23:44.861
- What happened?
- Rebb's tribe tried to kill me.

23:44.949 --> 23:47.478
I need to get to Gwynn
before Garret does.

23:48.111 --> 23:51.070
What about our journey to collect
the stone to complete the key?

23:51.158 --> 23:54.275
He'll kill the Queen.
Get up. I might need you.

24:15.931 --> 24:19.212
Welcome, cousin Milus.

24:21.946 --> 24:24.265
Was it really your hand
that wrote this?

24:24.353 --> 24:27.171
- It was.
- It says here that

24:27.259 --> 24:29.757
you'll surrender to us
all the lands west and south

24:29.845 --> 24:31.874
- of the Red-bank.
- That's what it says.

24:31.962 --> 24:33.908
And all I have to do
is shake your hand?

24:33.996 --> 24:37.798
Shake my hand,
declare peace between us,

24:37.942 --> 24:40.634
and declare yourself loyal
to the Queen.

24:59.049 --> 25:02.087
You failed to mention
that little addition.

25:02.175 --> 25:04.428
I mean, It seems I've come
a long way for nothing.

25:04.569 --> 25:07.816
I'm giving you everything
we've been at war over all these years.

25:07.904 --> 25:10.906
What, for a woman who claims
to be a surviving royal?

25:10.994 --> 25:13.079
She is who she says she is.

25:13.673 --> 25:16.761
Any day now, the Prime Order
will march over that hill

25:16.849 --> 25:19.007
and hang every one of you
for treason.

25:19.095 --> 25:20.917
And then I'll get
your land anyway.

25:21.004 --> 25:23.499
If you join us,
together we can defeat them.

25:23.587 --> 25:25.266
Or together we can hang.

25:25.697 --> 25:27.985
I'd rather take
the sure thing.

25:28.586 --> 25:31.360
You still only care
about yourself.

25:33.911 --> 25:35.992
That's true.

25:37.277 --> 25:39.460
And I find it hard to believe
you're ready to give up

25:39.548 --> 25:41.247
the best grazing land
in the Realm

25:41.334 --> 25:43.165
to a man
you'd rather see dead.

25:43.309 --> 25:46.764
I mean, what's so special
about this so-called queen

25:46.852 --> 25:49.725
that she would whip a man
like you to your knees?

25:49.813 --> 25:53.126
Why don't you meet her
and find out for yourself?

25:53.479 --> 25:59.539
With pleasure. I mean, that's all
I'm really here for anyway, isn't it?

26:17.461 --> 26:21.672
Your... alleged Majesty.

26:22.159 --> 26:25.289
Charming, and so respectful.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.148
I hear you've rejected
Tobin's offer of free land.

26:28.302 --> 26:30.586
Oh, I never agree
the first offer.

26:30.766 --> 26:34.195
Are you so poor that paying
nothing is still too much?

26:34.992 --> 26:38.354
It'll all be mine anyway
when the Prime Order attacks.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.422
Do you own any land, Milus?

26:42.625 --> 26:44.648
As far as the eye can see

26:45.109 --> 26:46.977
from every window
in my keep.

26:47.133 --> 26:49.476
No, you have nothing.

26:49.996 --> 26:51.909
The Prime Order owns that land.

26:52.199 --> 26:54.383
You merely manage it
at their bidding.

26:55.420 --> 26:57.903
And, um, what is your title?

26:57.991 --> 26:59.568
I am a Lord Baron.

26:59.656 --> 27:02.826
Milus, even to use
that term is heresy.

27:03.172 --> 27:06.437
You are just a humble servant
of the Prime Order

27:06.524 --> 27:07.945
like anyone else in the Realm.

27:08.073 --> 27:10.556
You have no title.
You have nothing.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.842
I am not thrilled
about the Prime Order,

27:12.930 --> 27:15.413
but I don't stick
my neck out, either.

27:15.595 --> 27:17.895
Same as anyone else
who likes their neck.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.328
You will be
grossly overwhelmed.

27:22.578 --> 27:24.826
Well, I'm confident
that most of the Realm

27:24.914 --> 27:26.672
will come to our side
once we get started.

27:26.764 --> 27:29.437
It only takes a few boulders
to start a landslide.

27:29.525 --> 27:31.258
Oh, I'm better off keeping
what I've got,

27:31.400 --> 27:34.070
even if it is under
the Prime Order's thumb.

27:34.334 --> 27:36.054
Why would I risk it?

27:42.288 --> 27:45.781
What if I were to give you
all of Tobin's land?

27:46.226 --> 27:48.177
Not just the lowlands.

27:49.109 --> 27:52.047
- All of it?
- All of it.

27:52.609 --> 27:54.570
You really need my help,
don't you?

27:54.739 --> 27:59.562
I am the Queen, Milus,
and I will retake the Realm.

27:59.763 --> 28:00.795
And after that,

28:00.883 --> 28:02.609
I will remember those
who supported me

28:02.721 --> 28:05.555
and those who did not.
The first will be richly rewarded.

28:05.734 --> 28:09.242
All of Tobin's lands?
You swear it?

28:09.515 --> 28:11.131
Well, Tobin
won't need any land,

28:11.219 --> 28:12.828
as he'll be married
to the queen.

28:17.603 --> 28:19.125
I will?

28:19.764 --> 28:20.907
You will.

28:21.070 --> 28:24.359
And I get all
of Tobin's lands?

28:24.586 --> 28:27.711
I will grant you
the Aegisford title and land

28:27.799 --> 28:30.882
if you reunite the Aegisford
family under one banner

28:30.970 --> 28:32.523
loyal to the Queen.

28:36.384 --> 28:38.914
You are one sly dog,
cousin.

28:39.034 --> 28:40.814
What is your answer?

28:43.238 --> 28:47.161
You will have your two boulders
to start your landslide,

28:47.489 --> 28:49.672
Your Majesty.

28:49.786 --> 28:52.742
My army will make preparations
to march immediately.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.920
Was that an acceptance
of that marriage proposal

29:10.008 --> 29:13.719
- I offered so many days ago?
- It was.

29:14.226 --> 29:18.391
I, uh...
I'm past the deadline.

29:18.622 --> 29:20.305
Is that all right?

29:20.423 --> 29:22.083
Ooh!

29:29.433 --> 29:32.559
20 Aegisford bannermen
will attend the wedding,

29:32.671 --> 29:34.710
one for each province
in his vassal.

29:34.886 --> 29:37.523
Two bannermen.
One for you and one for Tobin.

29:37.618 --> 29:39.889
Two? Ha! I'll agree to 12.

29:40.131 --> 29:42.515
One for each red moon
since Tobin's father died.

29:42.603 --> 29:45.194
Four. One for each season
since the old man croaked.

29:45.282 --> 29:47.522
- Ten. Ten.
- Five. I really think four is better.

29:47.610 --> 29:48.944
- Six.
- Done.

29:53.199 --> 29:56.539
Now, your people will supply
all the festooning,

29:56.627 --> 29:59.538
ornamentation, flowers,
and fanfare.

29:59.626 --> 30:02.460
Festooning? Flowers?
What do you think this is?

30:02.548 --> 30:05.390
A royal wedding.
She is the queen, is she not?

30:05.478 --> 30:07.843
This is a military outpost.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.069
We don't... we don't have
any of that kind of stuff.

30:10.157 --> 30:11.617
Well, you'll do
what you can.

30:11.705 --> 30:13.843
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll do what I can.

30:13.945 --> 30:16.476
I've got a couple
of horn blowers who can...

30:16.655 --> 30:18.140
Who can do a kind of a fanfare.

30:18.228 --> 30:20.413
And any booze you want,
you'll have to get from me.

30:20.516 --> 30:22.835
Fine. We'll get all
the inebriants from you.

30:22.923 --> 30:24.569
"Inebriants."

30:24.798 --> 30:27.388
Here's to the matchmakers.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.444
Long may they reign.

30:36.803 --> 30:39.054
Leave it. I'll manage.

30:40.983 --> 30:43.471
Thank you. You may go.

31:00.273 --> 31:02.413
I require nothing more.

31:03.753 --> 31:05.062
A moment of your time?

31:05.499 --> 31:07.319
Come in.

31:08.394 --> 31:09.564
I hope you have good news.

31:09.709 --> 31:11.116
Have you found a cure?

31:11.214 --> 31:14.144
Getting close, but, um,
that's not why I'm here.

31:14.256 --> 31:15.596
Why then?

31:15.871 --> 31:18.361
I've come to plead mercy
for Naya.

31:18.604 --> 31:20.654
I have nothing more
to say on that subject.

31:21.319 --> 31:22.951
Did you know that her mother

31:23.021 --> 31:24.117
and sister
are being held hostage?

31:24.204 --> 31:25.429
So she says.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.429
What would you have done
in her place?

31:27.517 --> 31:30.421
There is only one penalty
for the crime of treason.

31:30.509 --> 31:32.593
You make the laws.
You can change them.

31:32.681 --> 31:33.835
If I make one exception,

31:33.983 --> 31:35.997
then all the other spies
that come after that

31:36.085 --> 31:37.114
will expect the same thing.

31:37.202 --> 31:40.283
Your Majesty,
I have done a lot for you,

31:40.371 --> 31:43.210
and I'm this close to finding
a cure for the Plaguelings.

31:43.298 --> 31:46.132
- You owe me.
- I owe you nothing.

31:46.473 --> 31:47.973
I am your Queen.

31:52.105 --> 31:54.116
I am begging you.

31:54.453 --> 31:57.083
Please just do this
one thing for me.

31:57.335 --> 31:59.915
I'm asking you
as my friend, please.

32:00.065 --> 32:01.483
I love her.

32:05.189 --> 32:06.773
You and Naya are together?

32:06.928 --> 32:08.241
Mm.

32:08.564 --> 32:10.554
I love her very much.

32:11.882 --> 32:13.804
I loved her too, Janzo,

32:14.893 --> 32:16.718
which only makes it
more difficult.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.007
- But...
- But it changes nothing.

32:26.106 --> 32:27.406
Sorry, am I interrupting?

32:27.619 --> 32:29.189
No, your son
was just leaving.

32:29.356 --> 32:31.054
What is it, Elinor?

32:31.546 --> 32:34.249
Um, the...

32:34.760 --> 32:36.919
the prisoner
has cooperated fully.

32:37.007 --> 32:38.366
I believe we know everything.

32:38.454 --> 32:40.843
Execution is at first light.

32:42.154 --> 32:46.770
Mother, if there's anything you
do for me in my entire life,

32:46.858 --> 32:48.304
please let it be this.

32:49.012 --> 32:51.562
Naya doesn't deserve to die.

32:54.268 --> 32:57.351
- Yes, she does.
- I'm sorry, Janzo.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.840
Take heart that
we will grieve together.

32:59.928 --> 33:02.858
I don't even know
who you are anymore!

33:06.515 --> 33:08.499
Well, the wedding
is all arranged...

33:08.594 --> 33:10.452
To our advantage
in all respects.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.132
Thank you.

33:12.548 --> 33:14.678
- You all right?
- Yes, fine.

33:14.898 --> 33:17.578
I find my...
My hand won't behave.

33:17.979 --> 33:19.718
Understandable.

33:19.902 --> 33:23.171
Just 'cause you're queen doesn't
mean that you can't be human.

33:24.353 --> 33:26.491
That handmaid
was your friend?

33:26.863 --> 33:28.687
Yes, perhaps my closest.

33:28.962 --> 33:30.694
Except maybe Talon.

33:31.153 --> 33:32.452
I know.

33:32.647 --> 33:34.472
Sometimes being boss

33:34.560 --> 33:37.273
can stink more
than Remmick dung.

33:37.773 --> 33:39.523
That it can.

33:40.678 --> 33:42.085
There you are.

33:43.210 --> 33:45.130
You did the right thing,
Gwynn.

34:03.749 --> 34:05.210
Janzo.

34:07.081 --> 34:08.273
What's this about?

34:08.648 --> 34:11.958
Hello, Partridge,
Griffin, Varna.

34:13.804 --> 34:16.210
Deputy Marshal,
as I am sure you are well aware,

34:16.297 --> 34:19.132
my lady friend over here
is going to be executed at dawn.

34:19.329 --> 34:21.629
That's right,
and for good cause.

34:22.130 --> 34:24.280
Even so, I'd like to say
good-bye to her, please.

34:24.370 --> 34:27.498
It's not permitted to speak to
the prisoners after sentencing.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.324
I know, but we're all friends
here, aren't we?

34:29.429 --> 34:31.514
Right? And as a friend,

34:31.603 --> 34:33.889
I thought I would bring you
a tray of my finest ale.

34:35.253 --> 34:37.929
I cannot bend the rules,
even for friends, Janzo.

34:38.016 --> 34:42.527
Also, free drinks at the
Nightshade until next winter.

34:46.101 --> 34:47.831
Let me see that.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.663
- For all of us?
- Mm.

34:52.751 --> 34:54.072
- The Mistress approves?
- Mm-hmm.

34:54.195 --> 34:56.623
On the house.
Free drinks until next year.

34:56.774 --> 34:58.804
I just need a minute with her.

35:01.070 --> 35:02.398
Fellas!

35:02.588 --> 35:05.398
It's rather policy
than a rule, Janzo.

35:05.486 --> 35:07.241
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

35:14.814 --> 35:17.194
I tried to confess.
I was going to tell her everything.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.835
Shh. I know, I know.

35:18.923 --> 35:21.327
But it's because of me that
you're in here waiting to die.

35:21.415 --> 35:25.468
No, not because of you.
I did this. No one else.

35:25.648 --> 35:28.108
I only wanted to
save my family.

35:28.271 --> 35:30.616
- I know.
- Cheers.

35:33.780 --> 35:35.843
It's all right.
I'm ready to die.

35:35.931 --> 35:37.968
I told you I wasn't
going to let that happen.

35:38.056 --> 35:40.226
But there's nothing
you can do.

35:48.311 --> 35:49.976
Cinder moss.

35:51.874 --> 35:54.132
But when they wake up,
they'll arrest you.

35:54.220 --> 35:57.296
No, they won't. Because they won't
remember anything for hours before.

35:57.384 --> 35:59.483
Possibly even days.

36:07.657 --> 36:08.882
Mmm.

36:08.970 --> 36:11.480
- You are brilliant.
- Yes, I am.

36:12.331 --> 36:15.335
- Come on. Help me.
- Okay.

36:19.651 --> 36:21.661
Take it. Let's go.

36:43.019 --> 36:45.059
It's everything you'll need.

36:48.572 --> 36:50.199
You're not coming with me,
are you?

36:50.287 --> 36:53.257
I can't, Naya.
You know I can't.

36:56.969 --> 36:59.137
Mm.

36:59.603 --> 37:00.824
It figures.

37:00.912 --> 37:03.738
When I finally find
the one woman I'll ever love,

37:03.826 --> 37:05.527
I have to send her away.

37:05.615 --> 37:07.465
Welcome to my life.

37:07.553 --> 37:09.293
I promise I'll come back.

37:09.381 --> 37:10.488
Mm.

37:10.576 --> 37:12.590
You can't ever come back.
Promise me.

37:12.678 --> 37:14.863
They'll execute you if you do.

37:23.477 --> 37:26.887
Go. Go.

38:16.362 --> 38:18.042
Naya escaped.

38:50.759 --> 38:55.298
- Isn't he magnificent?
- Sure. I'd give him a go.

39:59.669 --> 40:01.040
You're alive.

40:01.128 --> 40:02.539
- Gwynn, listen to me.
- I can't believe it.

40:02.626 --> 40:04.243
It is not safe here.

40:04.331 --> 40:06.540
You are not safe here.
You need to come with me.

40:06.628 --> 40:09.029
What are you... what are
you talking about? Garret?

40:09.255 --> 40:11.017
Garret: Come on.

40:18.439 --> 40:20.313
- Was that?
- All: Garret.

40:20.783 --> 40:23.517
Garret, this is crazy.
Where have you been?

40:23.649 --> 40:25.510
I'll tell you all about it,
but right now we need to leave.

40:25.597 --> 40:28.501
- It's my wedding.
- Oh, is that what this is?

40:28.589 --> 40:31.127
Please, Gwynn, I need you
to trust me, all right?

40:31.215 --> 40:32.609
There are people here
who are trying to harm you.

40:32.713 --> 40:35.556
- Now we need to leave.
- Who?

40:39.663 --> 40:41.517
Do you trust me?

40:55.873 --> 40:57.407
That fits.

40:57.638 --> 41:00.946
Anyone my sister counsels
has to be bad.

41:01.118 --> 41:03.837
I beg your pardon.
What did you say?

41:03.979 --> 41:07.040
Mistress,
in Queen Rosmund's absence,

41:07.135 --> 41:08.260
I'm reporting to you,
the Queen's Counsel.

41:08.347 --> 41:09.970
Yes.

41:10.082 --> 41:11.722
The traitor Naya
has escaped.

41:13.906 --> 41:15.431
Right.

41:23.654 --> 41:25.794
I'm so glad
that you're alive.

41:26.239 --> 41:28.032
You knew I was alive.

41:28.496 --> 41:30.603
You just didn't care.

41:32.885 --> 41:35.063
What are you talking about?

41:36.320 --> 41:37.962
Garret?
