WEBVTT

00:07.224 --> 00:08.617
- Previously on
"Project Blue Book"...

00:08.747 --> 00:10.097
- We're supposed
to be meeting someone

00:10.227 --> 00:11.141
from Central Intelligence.
Daniel Banks?

00:11.272 --> 00:13.056
- Call me Dan.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.189
Since your intelligence is all
about staying off the radar,

00:15.319 --> 00:17.452
operating in the shadows.

00:17.582 --> 00:20.324
- Evan, I'm glad I caught you
before you left.

00:20.455 --> 00:21.804
- When Carolyn told me
who you were,

00:21.934 --> 00:23.632
I thought you were working
with the FBI.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.504
- What does the FBI want
with Civilian UFO Groups?

00:26.635 --> 00:29.638
- Mimi, you have the ability
to pass along information

00:29.768 --> 00:32.380
to the one person
who could make a difference.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.643
We could blow the lid off
this whole government cover-up.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.906
- Our intel
has the CIA cooperating

00:37.037 --> 00:38.429
with Quinn
and Professor Hynek.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.257
- I think the captain

00:40.388 --> 00:42.999
would provide for much better
source of information.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.133
- After what I just saw
in the desert,

00:46.263 --> 00:48.657
I'm convinced the CIA
has one goal,

00:48.787 --> 00:50.093
to see us obsolete.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.616
If we're going to war,

00:51.747 --> 00:53.488
let's fire
the first goddamn shot.

01:05.717 --> 01:10.287
- And little Johnny Paper
was never seen again.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.550
Why?

01:12.681 --> 01:16.859
Because if you meet
the black dog once,

01:16.989 --> 01:18.948
that's for joy.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.255
You meet him twice,

01:21.385 --> 01:24.040
that's for sorrow.

01:24.171 --> 01:27.739
But if you

01:27.870 --> 01:30.177
meet him three times.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.747
Well then,

01:35.878 --> 01:37.967
you're dead!

01:42.711 --> 01:44.321
- Jimmy Jay.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.976
- You told me
to tell them a bedtime story.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.586
- Go get me some more water.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.936
We need to get these ones
into the tub now.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.113
- Coming right up, Mama.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.559
Oh, my Lord.

02:28.104 --> 02:29.714
What in the world?

02:43.075 --> 02:44.773
Hey.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.607
- What's gotten
you all spooked?

02:52.737 --> 02:54.870
- I just saw a flying saucer
land in the woods,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.220
and now these creatures are
running around out there now.

02:57.351 --> 02:58.526
- Jimmy Jay,
haven't you scared

02:58.656 --> 02:59.918
those kids enough
for one night?

03:00.049 --> 03:01.572
- Do I look like I'm foolin'?

03:01.703 --> 03:05.402
Boys, get them kids
down in the cellar, now.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.448
- What in the world's
out there?

03:13.845 --> 03:15.456
- Hello?

03:15.586 --> 03:18.067
General, yes.
Uh-huh.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.678
I'm sorry,
could you say that again?

03:20.809 --> 03:23.942
I see.
Yes.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.728
Yeah, of course.
Right away.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.773
- Allen?
What is it?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.124
Allen?

03:32.255 --> 03:35.302
- I have to leave for Kentucky.
Some place called Hopkinsville.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.694
- Well, it sounded serious.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.654
- It sounded
like a lot more than that.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.830
- Okay, well,
I will make coffee

03:41.960 --> 03:43.310
and you can tell me
all about it.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.050
- No, no, you just--
just go back to sleep.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.096
I'll call you
when I get there.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.975
What are you doing?

04:40.105 --> 04:42.717
- I couldn't sleep.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.285
So I decided to try on
some of your clothes.

04:45.415 --> 04:46.982
- Looks good on you.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.814
Hello?

04:52.944 --> 04:54.598
General.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.820
Uh-huh.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.737
Yes, sir.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.610
Roger that.

05:13.051 --> 05:16.011
I got to go.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.753
So I'm gonna be needing this.

05:23.410 --> 05:26.108
- Change of plans?

05:26.238 --> 05:27.892
- We'll wait and see.

05:29.807 --> 05:30.765
- We all set?

05:33.507 --> 05:34.725
- You know,
there's a saying in chess.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.817
"Pawns are the soul
of the game."

05:39.948 --> 05:41.776
You just have to know
where and when to move them.

05:43.995 --> 05:47.434
- When are you gonna take up
golf like the rest of us, huh?

05:47.564 --> 05:50.132
Plan is in motion.

05:50.262 --> 05:53.570
The "pawns" are
on their way to Hopkinsville.

05:53.701 --> 05:57.182
We'll only have
one shot at this,

05:57.313 --> 06:00.925
so let's make sure our aim
is true this time, huh?

06:01.056 --> 06:02.492
- Yeah.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.235
- Make sure.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.974
- Why is it always UFOs land
in the woods?

06:50.105 --> 06:51.672
You know, just once
I'd like to hear

06:51.802 --> 06:54.588
about a "saucer-shaped object"
putting down in Times Square.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.155
- "Take me to your leader."

06:57.286 --> 06:58.548
- You ever been
to Times Square, Doc?

06:58.679 --> 07:00.898
- Oh, yes.
Several times.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.422
- Then you know.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.641
Those aliens would never
make it past 49th Street.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.557
What in the world?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.013
- Hey, come take
a look at this.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.320
- Hello.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.975
- You're the hot shot
Air Force investigators.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.846
- I'm Captain Michael Quinn,

07:35.977 --> 07:37.935
Inspector Allen Hynek.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.111
- So, what'd they tell you
on the telephone?

07:40.242 --> 07:43.071
- Just that a family reported
having an encounter.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.768
That's all?

07:47.597 --> 07:49.294
Come on in.

07:49.425 --> 07:52.515
Folks, this here's
the Air Force.

07:52.646 --> 07:55.475
They're here to help you figure
out what happened last night.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.389
- I told you we already know
what happened, Sheriff.

07:59.261 --> 08:00.871
- What's your name, sir?

08:01.002 --> 08:02.743
- Jimmy Jay Shoemaker.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.659
This is my house,
my family.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.312
- Nice to meet you all.

08:07.443 --> 08:08.923
- Are you gonna believe me?

08:09.053 --> 08:12.448
- All we want is
to just hear your story.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.624
Start to finish.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.844
- My story?

08:16.974 --> 08:20.325
My story is aliens landed here
and tried to kill us all.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.764
- And were you the only one

08:23.894 --> 08:26.810
who saw these aliens,
Mr. Shoemaker?

08:26.941 --> 08:29.160
- No, sir.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.989
We all saw them.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.731
- And who would like
to describe for me

08:34.862 --> 08:36.385
exactly what they--
they looked like?

08:39.519 --> 08:42.652
- It was like a--like
a horror movie in real life.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.481
- Like "War of the Worlds"
only worse.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.614
- Their heads, they were
as big as watermelons.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.007
Beady little eyes.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.226
- I thought they looked
just like us,

08:51.356 --> 08:52.444
but their eyes were big.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.359
Big and black as car tires.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.581
- And they had these claws
like an eagle.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.846
- They weren't claws.
They were hands.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.500
But with only
three long fingers.

09:07.503 --> 09:08.939
- If you ask me,

09:09.070 --> 09:11.725
we're lucky to be alive.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.257
Looks like you guys
had yourselves

09:22.387 --> 09:23.867
a hell of a party here
last night.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.347
- Pardon?

09:27.784 --> 09:29.699
- You know,
sometimes our imagination

09:29.830 --> 09:31.266
can get the better of us.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.834
Especially after a couple
of late night cold ones.

09:33.964 --> 09:37.620
- I did not shoot up my house
and scare my kids half to death

09:37.751 --> 09:40.014
because I had a few beers.

09:40.144 --> 09:43.583
What do you think I am, huh?
Just some dumb hillbilly?

09:45.628 --> 09:46.629
- That's not what I'm saying.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.939
Could you just excuse me
one moment?

09:54.115 --> 09:55.812
A little help here,
please, Doc?

09:55.943 --> 09:58.423
- Looks like we may need to
deal with this invasion first.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.253
- Just what this circus needs.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.168
More clowns.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.170
- How many aliens were there?
Can you give us a description?

10:06.301 --> 10:07.302
Are we under attack?

10:07.432 --> 10:09.217
- Gentlemen, ladies,
as I said,

10:09.347 --> 10:11.567
our investigation
is just beginning, but I--

10:11.698 --> 10:12.916
- If you could all
just turn around and go,

10:13.047 --> 10:14.614
before we have...

10:14.744 --> 10:16.746
- There is nothing
to report here.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.227
As I said, we will issue
a statement in due time.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.011
We understand
we have unknown...

10:21.142 --> 10:22.883
- Yeah, he had almond shaped
eyes and really long fingers.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.058
- Yeah, how's that?
Big enough?

10:24.188 --> 10:25.842
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that--that's it.

10:25.973 --> 10:29.193
- Jimmy Jay, why don't you
go on back inside?

10:29.324 --> 10:31.065
Please?

10:31.195 --> 10:33.241
Thank you.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.026
Sorry about that.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.028
He'll be available
in just a few.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.639
- That's okay.
I got what I came for.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.205
- What do you got there?

10:41.336 --> 10:43.512
- Description
of the alien invader.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.166
- Oh, really?
Let me see that.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.865
Huh.

10:48.996 --> 10:51.825
- Hey, you can't do that.
That's my personal property.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.044
- It is now evidence
in an Air Force investigation.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.872
- Give me that back.
- Officer. Thank you.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.265
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.919
- You can't bother
these people, move it.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.834
- What was all that about?

11:00.964 --> 11:03.488
- Looks like Jimmy Jay
is already selling his story.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.795
- Little green monsters.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.841
That's what
they're calling them.

11:07.971 --> 11:11.018
Early reports are saying almost
a dozen aliens were spotted.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.977
- Actual contact?
Like we predicted?

11:14.108 --> 11:16.458
- Local police said it was
a full scale invasion.

11:16.588 --> 11:20.767
- I'm not sure
that's entirely accurate.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.291
- I suppose you were told
something different?

11:23.421 --> 11:25.859
The official story,
I'm guessing.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.688
The cover-up.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.647
- Go ahead, Mimi.
What-what were you gonna say?

11:31.778 --> 11:34.868
- Allen's actually
in Kentucky right now.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.174
And I know from his work,

11:37.305 --> 11:41.875
eyewitness testimony is often
inaccurate, even erratic.

11:42.005 --> 11:44.094
In fact, I've reviewed his
notes on several cases, and--

11:44.225 --> 11:46.053
- Oh, I'm sure you have.

11:46.183 --> 11:49.230
That way you can get your
stories straight, and do to us

11:49.360 --> 11:51.972
what the government is trying
to do to the whole country.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.409
Convince us that none
of this is true.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.455
Am I right?

11:57.586 --> 11:59.240
- Yes, ma'am.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.348
- You put up quite
a fight, darling.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.306
How's your head?

12:22.437 --> 12:25.135
- He was called away.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.224
I had no way of knowing.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.836
I can get him for you
the minute he returns.

12:29.966 --> 12:34.231
- I had your word
the first time, hmm?

12:34.362 --> 12:36.712
So what value should
I place on it now?

12:43.588 --> 12:44.546
What is this?
What are you doing?

12:46.635 --> 12:48.332
- Where is it?

12:48.463 --> 12:49.943
- No, no, no.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.640
Wait.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.077
- Where are you going?

12:54.208 --> 12:56.776
- It's not safe to stay
in this house any longer.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.865
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
We have the situation in hand.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.823
Those reporters,
they won't bother you anymore.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.782
- I don't care about them.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.435
Come on, Ruthie.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.394
- Until we've finished
our investigation,

13:06.524 --> 13:08.048
we're gonna need you
to stop talking to them,

13:08.178 --> 13:10.093
putting these crazy ideas
in their head.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.834
- You still think I'm lying.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.578
If I cared about lying,
I'd had called

13:16.708 --> 13:18.710
the sheriff after
the first night, wouldn't I?

13:18.841 --> 13:20.321
- The first night?

13:20.451 --> 13:23.324
- Yeah, those things came back
two nights in a row.

13:24.978 --> 13:25.935
Second night they came,

13:27.632 --> 13:29.286
I, uh...

13:29.417 --> 13:31.114
I shot one of them.

13:31.245 --> 13:34.378
He ran off into the woods.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.250
I bet you
it's still out there now.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.692
- So I'm an alien
and I get shot.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.346
Which way do I go?

13:45.476 --> 13:47.565
This way?
No.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.741
That way?

13:49.872 --> 13:51.047
Maybe up a tree.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.832
- You're not helping.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.051
- Just think about what
we're doing out here right now.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.097
Look, come on.
Let's...

13:57.227 --> 13:58.620
It's getting dark.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.404
Let's head on back before we...

14:02.537 --> 14:03.755
Hey, Doc.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.459
What is that?

14:14.941 --> 14:16.638
That look like
a handprint to you?

14:16.768 --> 14:18.422
- Possibly.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.294
- Why is it green?

14:20.424 --> 14:23.688
- There is a local
bioluminescent spore,

14:23.819 --> 14:26.778
grows on decaying wood
called "foxfire."

14:26.909 --> 14:30.652
But this wood still looks very
much alive, and this smells...

14:32.654 --> 14:36.614
It's not organic.
It's almost chemical.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.007
- Oh, hey, hey.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.487
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

14:39.617 --> 14:42.185
- Well...

14:42.316 --> 14:44.318
until we test it,
we don't know what it is.

14:44.448 --> 14:47.321
- But what if it's, like,
alien blood or something?

14:47.451 --> 14:50.454
- Would aliens bleed
if they were shot, Captain?

14:50.585 --> 14:52.804
- I don't know
how to answer that.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.464
- Did you just eat
that whole tin?

15:00.595 --> 15:03.293
- Grippos Pretzels.
They're amazing.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.425
- Hey, what are we having
for dinner?

15:04.555 --> 15:05.905
- That was dinner.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.558
- What, for both of us?

15:07.689 --> 15:09.952
- I got you your own tin.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.650
I also got bourbon.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.502
- Hello?

15:38.633 --> 15:40.026
- Mimi?

15:40.156 --> 15:41.766
- Allen.
Are you still in Kentucky?

15:41.897 --> 15:43.943
- Yes, and I'm afraid
the Captain and I

15:44.073 --> 15:45.466
are going to have
to spend the night now.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.772
- What is going on?
Can you tell me anything?

15:47.903 --> 15:49.035
I've been reading
all the papers, and--

15:49.165 --> 15:50.732
- Don't pay attention
to any of it.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.647
I'll tell you the real story
as soon as we know it.

15:52.777 --> 15:55.650
Okay?
I promise.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.521
- The people in my group
are calling it an invasion.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.870
- Mimi?

15:59.001 --> 16:00.220
The Captain and I
are managing it.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.482
- But the people
in my group are--

16:01.612 --> 16:03.571
- Is there anything else?

16:06.748 --> 16:09.838
- A man named Daniel Banks
has been calling the house.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.667
Said he needed you to get in
contact with him right away.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.148
- Banks.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.846
All right,
well, if he calls again,

16:17.977 --> 16:19.413
you tell him that I'm in
Hopkinsville for the night,

16:19.543 --> 16:20.805
and I should be home tomorrow.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.894
- Will do.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.681
- Um, I have to go before it
gets dark, but I'll check in

16:26.811 --> 16:28.117
first thing in the morning when
we're back on the road, okay?

16:28.248 --> 16:29.771
- Okay.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.295
Bye.
- Bye.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.978
- Evan?
It's Mimi.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.764
How would you feel

17:06.895 --> 17:08.723
about going
on a road trip with me?

17:11.552 --> 17:14.163
- No.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.082
No.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.001
Please.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.753
- You were always my favorite.

17:45.368 --> 17:47.153
Before I go...

17:49.329 --> 17:51.766
is there anything
you would like me to tell her?

17:55.248 --> 17:56.771
You know I'm going to find her.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.254
And when she's old enough,

18:01.384 --> 18:03.169
recruit her.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.738
I just hope for your sake

18:07.869 --> 18:10.350
that she's not going
to disappoint us the same way.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.224
- Don't you fucking dare.

18:18.488 --> 18:19.881
- Finish.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.147
- General sold me
a bill of goods.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.629
Blue Book was just
the beginning, they said.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.285
A first step to greater glory.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.514
Promised me the future.
All I do is run in place.

18:44.645 --> 18:48.214
- Did you know that bourbon was
invented by a Baptist minister?

18:49.867 --> 18:51.217
That's true.

18:54.263 --> 18:55.786
- I open up my soul to you,

18:55.917 --> 18:58.876
all you do is give me
a history of booze?

18:59.007 --> 19:01.836
- All right, well, if we're
talking about personal matters,

19:01.966 --> 19:05.622
then why don't you tell me

19:05.753 --> 19:09.017
something about this new woman
in your life?

19:10.323 --> 19:11.454
- How did you know about that?

19:11.585 --> 19:13.369
- Oh, you're much more
of an open book

19:13.500 --> 19:15.763
than you think, Captain.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.939
- Oh, I am, am I?
- Yes.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.683
All right then.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.554
Well, what else you got
figured out about me, huh?

19:27.557 --> 19:29.342
- You want kids.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.909
Desperately.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.522
But the very idea
of it terrifies you.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.134
I imagine that's to do

19:39.265 --> 19:41.049
with some sort of
tragedy in your past.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.627
- I think that
bourbon's giving you

19:53.757 --> 19:55.194
a little extra
confidence there.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.978
- Well, am I wrong?

20:06.466 --> 20:08.032
- It's Susie.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.904
Mimi's friend.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.125
- Susie.
- Yeah, Susie.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.084
- Susie, Susie?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.955
- Why, I'm not--
this is--does--

20:18.086 --> 20:19.566
Does Mimi know about this?

20:19.696 --> 20:21.089
- No, no, this has sort of
been our little secret.

20:24.005 --> 20:26.442
I like her, Doc.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.183
I like her a lot.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.015
So how long you and Mimi
been together, huh?

20:34.145 --> 20:35.234
- 15 years.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.279
- Oh.
15 years, huh?

20:37.410 --> 20:39.368
- You know, sometimes it feels
like the day we first met.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.371
- She still does it
for you, huh?

20:42.502 --> 20:44.068
- Yeah.

20:44.199 --> 20:45.331
I like her.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.377
I like her a lot.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.603
Something out there.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.353
- We really need
some light out here.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.789
- Yeah.
Where's that lantern?

21:08.919 --> 21:10.660
- Oh, it's back
at the farmhouse.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.677
- Hello?

21:34.467 --> 21:35.903
- Anyone have a match?

21:38.514 --> 21:40.734
I hit the road the minute your
wife told me where you were.

21:40.864 --> 21:43.040
Blew out a tire
outside of town.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.955
I've been on foot
for almost an hour.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.261
- That's a long walk.

21:46.392 --> 21:47.523
- In the dark?

21:47.654 --> 21:50.483
In this part of the South?
Yeah, it is.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.223
- Yeah, what was so important

21:52.354 --> 21:54.835
that you had
to get here tonight?

21:54.965 --> 21:57.490
- The CIA has acquired

21:57.620 --> 22:00.014
intelligence detailing
an imminent threat.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.668
- What kind of threat?

22:01.798 --> 22:03.757
- An invasion.

22:05.802 --> 22:09.502
An alien invasion.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.330
- Come on, that's
not even funny right now.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.201
- I know.
It sounds completely crazy.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.942
- Well, I don't know.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.379
Where exactly is this intel
coming from?

22:17.510 --> 22:19.729
- Her name is Rebecca.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.296
- And who is Rebecca?

22:25.822 --> 22:27.476
- She drew this.

22:31.524 --> 22:34.048
Rebecca is part of a new,
highly classified intelligence

22:34.178 --> 22:37.791
gathering program developed
by the CIA called "MK Ultra."

22:37.921 --> 22:39.967
It involves precognition.
Seeing the future.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.405
She's the one who drew this.

22:43.536 --> 22:44.841
- Hang on.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.682
- What is that?

22:59.813 --> 23:02.250
- One of our eyewitnesses here
described this.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.037
- This "Rebecca,"
when did she draw yours?

23:07.168 --> 23:08.909
- Four days ago.

23:09.039 --> 23:11.128
- She tell you anything else
about this upcoming invasion?

23:11.259 --> 23:12.826
- Yeah.

23:12.956 --> 23:15.742
She said that Hopkinsville
is the center point.

23:15.872 --> 23:18.919
And that you two were the
only ones who could stop it.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.285
Maybe we should've gone left
at that fork five miles back.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.854
Why are you slowing down?

23:40.984 --> 23:43.813
- I'm asking for directions.
Locals will know where to go.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.162
- Stay here.
I'll ask.

23:48.252 --> 23:50.080
Afternoon, sir.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.909
We--we were just looking
for Hopkinsville.

23:59.481 --> 24:00.830
- What'd he say?

24:00.961 --> 24:02.397
- He didn't have
to say anything.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.486
Let's just go, come on.
- Well, let me talk to him.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.836
- What? No, no, no.
Wait. Mimi.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.534
- Excuse me, sir?

24:08.664 --> 24:10.231
- If you're after them aliens,

24:10.361 --> 24:12.146
you can just turn
right back around.

24:12.276 --> 24:14.453
- Sorry?

24:14.583 --> 24:17.107
- You newspaper people.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.022
You come down here
and make us all look foolish.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.850
You go on now.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.591
- No, we're not
from the newspaper.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.941
- Sir, you can't
point that at her.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.074
- Everything's fine.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.380
We're part
of a civilian UFO group,

24:29.511 --> 24:31.600
and we're trying to get
to the truth.

24:31.731 --> 24:34.777
So we can tell the world
what really happened here.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.088
But you don't believe
the story, do you?

24:44.831 --> 24:47.529
- I've known that family
a long time.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.314
Them and the truth
are not related.

24:50.445 --> 24:53.317
And if Jimmy Jay's lips
are movin', he's lyin'.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.363
- Well, then his story
shouldn't be the one that

24:55.494 --> 24:57.844
gets out and makes everyone in
town look foolish, should it?

25:00.368 --> 25:03.719
- We created MK Ultra
to investigate the paranormal

25:03.850 --> 25:06.156
after learning the Russians
were working on harnessing

25:06.287 --> 25:08.550
psychic activity
for intelligence purposes.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.552
- Psychics as
a national defense strategy.

25:10.683 --> 25:11.988
What's next, voodoo?

25:16.079 --> 25:18.995
- Unless you're spoken to,
do not address her directly.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.049
Rebecca,
these are the gentlemen

25:29.179 --> 25:30.920
that you told us about.

25:36.099 --> 25:38.624
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

25:38.754 --> 25:40.103
- He has to leave.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.062
- Me?

25:42.192 --> 25:43.324
- We'll step outside.

25:43.454 --> 25:46.109
- But I'd like to observe.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.850
- You can stay.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.854
- Sorry, Professor.

25:55.292 --> 25:57.381
- It's all right, Doc.
I got this.

26:02.648 --> 26:05.433
- I'm sorry.
Some people can block things.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.392
It's just how it works.

26:08.523 --> 26:11.308
- It's okay.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.572
So, what do I--

26:13.702 --> 26:16.052
- Please stop talking.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.880
- Roger that.

26:18.011 --> 26:19.969
- That's talking.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.604
- Where do you find
these people?

26:45.734 --> 26:49.129
- That's something
I can't share.

26:49.259 --> 26:51.871
- Now, I knew someone else who
predicted an encounter once.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.829
- Something big
is about to happen.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.791
- How many people do you have
working at this facility?

26:58.921 --> 27:00.880
- What are you getting at?

27:01.010 --> 27:03.665
- I'm wondering
if I may have met someone

27:03.796 --> 27:07.669
who either works here
or worked here at one point.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.629
Demonstrated the same
kind of precognitive ability

27:10.759 --> 27:13.457
with an insider's knowledge
of government intelligence.

27:13.588 --> 27:16.460
- Well, tell me more,

27:16.591 --> 27:19.159
you know, about this--
this person.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.435
- Whatever kind
of shelter you find,

27:34.565 --> 27:36.872
settle down and make
the best of it.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.094
If there are others with you,

27:41.224 --> 27:43.618
help them by being
as calm as you can.

28:38.107 --> 28:40.196
- Hey, asshole.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.659
- So, uh...

29:10.531 --> 29:12.968
Evidently this--
this is all

29:13.099 --> 29:15.275
gonna happen
in Hopkinsville tonight.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.714
- You know, I was hoping
that we were gonna witness

29:19.845 --> 29:22.499
some genuine clairvoyant
phenomena here today.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.501
I was really was,
but look at these.

29:24.632 --> 29:27.156
Just vague enough
to induce anxiety.

29:27.287 --> 29:28.941
This is no different
from an inkblot test,

29:29.071 --> 29:30.725
except in this case,

29:30.856 --> 29:32.553
you're only seeing
what she wants you to see.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.207
- How could she be
so confident then?

29:34.337 --> 29:35.774
- With all due respect,
the Captain and I

29:35.904 --> 29:37.732
have not completed our
investigation into Hopkinsville

29:37.863 --> 29:39.168
and bringing
in military personnel

29:39.299 --> 29:40.256
will only create a panic.

29:40.387 --> 29:41.997
Thank you,

29:42.128 --> 29:43.520
but we still have
a case to close.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.392
Captain?

29:48.438 --> 29:49.875
I'm not saying I don't think

29:50.005 --> 29:52.747
the possibility
of precognition exists.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.488
- Well, then why be so quick
to dismiss it?

29:54.618 --> 29:55.881
- Well, it's hard enough

29:56.011 --> 29:57.926
trying to solve a case
of alien invaders.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.624
Saying we used CIA psychics
to get there?

30:00.755 --> 30:03.758
I don't know, as a scientist,
I--I simply--I can't.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.630
Certainly not to the generals.
Excuse me.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.458
We were looking
to match a paint color.

30:08.589 --> 30:09.982
Do you do that here?

30:10.112 --> 30:12.245
- We can try.
- How about this?

30:14.116 --> 30:15.988
- Oh, that's not paint.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.554
Doesn't smell like it either.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.121
- Well, can you identify
what it is?

30:19.252 --> 30:21.863
- It's a glaze.
Hold on.

30:25.736 --> 30:28.348
- That man in the hat
that led us to D.C.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.524
You said he predicted
that flyover to the minute.

30:30.654 --> 30:31.742
That convinced you, didn't it?

30:31.873 --> 30:33.309
- Yeah, I brought him up
with Daniel.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.659
- Yeah, what'd he say?
- More what he didn't say.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.748
I got the sense there's
a lot more to the story,

30:37.879 --> 30:39.533
but he didn't wanna tell.
- Yeah.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.883
- This is it right here.

30:46.061 --> 30:49.151
- Glaze.
Works just like paint.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.066
- More applications,
better weatherproofing.

30:51.197 --> 30:53.547
- Have you sold any
of this recently?

30:53.677 --> 30:55.027
- As a matter of fact, yes.

30:55.157 --> 30:57.377
Part of a larger order
from our regular customer.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.118
- Can we guess who that was?

31:09.171 --> 31:10.825
- Hello.
- Good evening.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.134
- Bet you they got a horse
with a garden hose

31:15.264 --> 31:16.918
taped to its snout,
call it an elephant.

31:17.049 --> 31:18.877
- Easy, easy.

31:19.007 --> 31:20.879
That's it.
That's it.

31:21.009 --> 31:21.923
- Mr. Shoemaker?

31:24.273 --> 31:26.058
Jimmy Jay?

31:26.188 --> 31:28.408
- This about the aliens,
I'm charging for my time now.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.192
- We're not reporters.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.283
We're from Ringling Brothers.

31:34.414 --> 31:37.025
I'm sure you're familiar
with us, yes?

31:37.156 --> 31:40.289
- Yeah, of course I am.
What are your names?

31:40.420 --> 31:43.162
- This is Mimi.
I'm Evan.

31:43.292 --> 31:46.905
And you're Jimmy Jay,
the famous alien killer.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.950
Well, we've traveled
a long way to see you, sir.

31:49.081 --> 31:51.387
- Well, what can I do
for you folks?

31:51.518 --> 31:53.781
- Well, the bosses
had us come down here,

31:53.912 --> 31:56.218
talk about maybe getting you
to join the big time.

31:56.349 --> 31:59.395
- "The Great Alien Killer,
Jimmy Jay Shoemaker!"

31:59.526 --> 32:01.832
- Course, we just need
to verify some of the details

32:01.963 --> 32:04.313
of your story first.
Isn't that right?

32:04.444 --> 32:06.272
- It's corporate policy.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.839
- So, whatever
you could give us

32:08.970 --> 32:11.886
to help convince our audience
that you're telling the truth.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.280
You know, any physical
evidence, any photos.

32:14.410 --> 32:17.022
- Well, I wish I could help,
but, um,

32:17.152 --> 32:20.329
those government men that came,
they--they took it all away.

32:20.460 --> 32:23.202
They called themselves
Blue Book?

32:23.332 --> 32:25.160
They don't want nobody
to know the truth.

32:25.291 --> 32:28.381
- Hey, Jimmy Jay, they
need you at the box office.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.992
- I'm sorry, but I got
a show to set up for.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.776
But we'll talk after,
all right?

32:32.907 --> 32:34.256
Stick around.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.649
You'll see what a real circus
looks like.

32:38.869 --> 32:39.958
- He's lying.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.785
- About which part?

32:41.916 --> 32:44.440
He's already trying to sell
a painted donkey as a zebra.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.399
- No, about my husband.

32:46.529 --> 32:49.097
Allen wouldn't try
to cover anything up.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.839
- Do you really know that
for a fact, Mimi?

32:51.970 --> 32:54.798
After everything
I've shown you.

32:54.929 --> 32:57.976
Look, isn't it at least
possible that Allen's

32:58.106 --> 33:01.544
been selective about what
he's been sharing with you?

33:01.675 --> 33:03.155
- No.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.984
Allen is the most honest man
I have ever known.

33:06.114 --> 33:08.029
- Mimi?

33:09.683 --> 33:11.032
- Allen?

33:11.163 --> 33:12.686
- What are you doing here?

33:12.816 --> 33:15.645
- Professor.
Evan William Blake.

33:15.776 --> 33:17.125
It's nice to meet you.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.909
And--and you're
Captain Michael Quinn.

33:21.303 --> 33:24.002
- Evan's part of my UFO group,

33:24.132 --> 33:29.572
and he's been helping me
with my research.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.226
- Research?
- But what are you doing here?

33:31.357 --> 33:32.271
- This isn't your source,
is it?

33:32.401 --> 33:34.099
- Helping you.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.842
We were just speaking
with Jimmy Jay, and...

33:46.589 --> 33:51.464
I think I may know
what actually happened here.

33:53.205 --> 33:54.815
Mimi?

33:59.559 --> 34:01.430
- Remember I told you
when I was little,

34:01.561 --> 34:03.780
and my dad used to take me
to the circus?

34:03.911 --> 34:05.173
- Yeah, of course.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.219
You said that was
your favorite thing.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.658
- Well, there was one thing
I loved the most.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.576
- Monkeys.

34:16.706 --> 34:18.621
Because they were trained.

34:18.752 --> 34:21.146
- And usually in costume.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.193
- Hey, Doc.

34:25.324 --> 34:26.629
Look familiar?

34:30.894 --> 34:32.157
- Look at this.

34:36.378 --> 34:38.119
- What's going on in here?

34:38.250 --> 34:40.426
- Maybe you'd like to tell us.

34:40.556 --> 34:43.516
- I'm trying to sell tickets.
- No, you tried to pull a scam.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.128
Not only did you waste
the Air Force's time

34:47.259 --> 34:48.651
by putting out
misleading stories,

34:48.782 --> 34:50.305
you also scared
half of Kentucky.

34:51.959 --> 34:54.396
- You work with them?
Hmm?

34:54.527 --> 34:57.007
All that talk about
Ringling Brothers was a lie?

35:00.228 --> 35:02.578
I knew it.

35:02.709 --> 35:05.233
You government people will
do anything to hide the truth.

35:07.714 --> 35:11.718
The monkey's part of
a recreation for the circus.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.287
But what happened earlier,

35:15.417 --> 35:17.898
that was real.

35:18.028 --> 35:20.640
And I'll never change my story.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.730
- It's the Army.
- What are they doing here?

35:23.860 --> 35:26.124
- Why is the Army here?
- Those look like Army trucks.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.258
- Doc, what's going on?

35:30.389 --> 35:34.044
- The CIA is preparing
for an alien invasion.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.221
- We have
to follow those trucks.

35:36.351 --> 35:37.961
- Stay here,
tell everyone there's nothing

35:38.092 --> 35:39.528
to worry about,
everything's under control.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.974
- Stop here.
Kill the lights.

35:51.105 --> 35:52.237
You don't want them to see us.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.643
- If they're preparing
for an invasion, Doc,

36:07.774 --> 36:09.167
then why are they hiding?

36:42.461 --> 36:45.246
Did the CIA capture
a flying saucer already?

36:49.250 --> 36:51.165
- Looks more like
they created one.

37:01.349 --> 37:04.483
Not CIA.
Air Force.

37:04.613 --> 37:07.747
- Halt! Hands up!

37:07.877 --> 37:10.706
- Tethered Aerial
Detection System.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.796
Tracks boats, ground vehicles,
manned airplanes,

37:13.927 --> 37:15.102
all from the sky.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.409
Works as
an early warning system.

37:17.539 --> 37:21.108
- And after unproven reports
of an alien invasion,

37:21.239 --> 37:25.330
you deployed them
to Hopkinsville?

37:29.943 --> 37:32.337
- Did you close the case
or not?

37:32.467 --> 37:34.339
- Well, yes, we did, sir.

37:34.469 --> 37:35.992
It was monkeys.

37:38.343 --> 37:41.563
- Circus monkeys.

37:41.694 --> 37:44.044
Hopkinsville was nothing more
than a hoax.

37:56.186 --> 37:58.580
- Those are pretty.

37:58.711 --> 38:01.366
Add a little sugar to the
water, they'll last longer too.

38:09.678 --> 38:11.550
- Vodka, actually.

38:14.248 --> 38:16.076
It's a trick
most people don't know.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.911
- It certainly preserved you
quite well.

38:47.847 --> 38:49.370
He's one of yours, yes?

38:55.507 --> 38:58.379
He's working
with the Americans now.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.512
- How do you know that?

39:00.642 --> 39:03.645
- I'm going to kill him
for you.

39:03.776 --> 39:05.647
And then we'll be even.

39:07.475 --> 39:08.694
Is that clear?

39:10.652 --> 39:11.958
- What else?

39:15.831 --> 39:17.093
- My daughter.

39:19.661 --> 39:20.923
- We won't touch her--

39:21.054 --> 39:23.491
- You won't even think
about her.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.671
- I wish you both well.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.662
- Well, the last thing
we need is more exposure.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.490
So if it's gonna happen, we're
gonna wanna bring them back

40:05.620 --> 40:08.580
on a Tuesday.

40:08.710 --> 40:10.364
What the hell are you doing
in here?

40:10.495 --> 40:13.062
- Southpaw, huh?

40:13.193 --> 40:15.151
You know I hated southpaws
when I boxed.

40:15.282 --> 40:18.416
Rangy bastards.
All of them.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.505
- Did you ever get
knocked out by one?

40:20.635 --> 40:22.811
- I'm sorry.
Forgive me, I'm being rude.

40:22.942 --> 40:25.771
I only stopped by
to drop this off.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.773
- And what is that?

40:32.081 --> 40:35.345
"Research into scheduling
of secret and purposeful

40:35.476 --> 40:39.698
"aerial activity in designated
locations shows promise.

40:39.828 --> 40:42.048
"Both to test levels
of civilian stress

40:42.178 --> 40:45.660
and the response
by local authorities."

40:45.791 --> 40:47.488
Staging a fake alien invasion

40:47.619 --> 40:49.359

40:54.930 --> 40:57.933
- You looking
to start a war, son?

40:58.064 --> 40:59.718
- We have enough problems
worrying about the one

40:59.848 --> 41:01.589
the Russians are trying
to start, General.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.765
You and I should be looking
to avoid one.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.463
- What do you want?

41:05.593 --> 41:07.987
- Time comes,

41:12.905 --> 41:14.646
Yeah.

41:14.776 --> 41:17.779
