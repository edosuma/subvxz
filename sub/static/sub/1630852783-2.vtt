a sexual nature and some strong language.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.519
Hello, you've reached
Chloe Fairbourne.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.679
Please leave me a message
after the beep.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.360
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can. Bye.

DIAL TONE RINGS
WOMAN: Hello? Becky. Chloe?

00:25.960 --> 00:28.560
Chloe. What did…
What did you want to say?

00:31.960 --> 00:35.479
CHLOE: I'm just going to experience
life out there for a few years.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.159
Then I spent six months up there,
got to know people,

00:38.160 --> 00:39.799
got to know the city.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.159
The most exciting place to live
is Daikanyama.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.959
MAN: Daikanyama? Yeah. Yeah, so,
it's a bit more residential,

00:46.960 --> 00:50.239
but it's got some really lovely
shops. If you get a chance to visit,

00:50.240 --> 00:53.119
there's an amazing unagi place
called Nodina.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.760
I really recommend it.
I absolutely love unagi. Yes!

01:03.680 --> 01:07.879
At Nodina in Daikanyama, the best
unagi I have ever had.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.180
Wow, I mean, you're coming through
with some great recommendations…

01:12.600 --> 01:15.119
BECKY: It's such an amazing
area, Daikanyama.

01:15.120 --> 01:18.679
Ooh, this is the flat I lived in
with Alex and Natalia.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.319
Oh, my God, Liv, there was this
place around the corner

01:21.320 --> 01:24.679
that just did the best unagi.
I still think about it twice a day.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.679
Oh, God, I'm salivating.
It was so good.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.959
Shall we order some food?
I think we should.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.000
LAUGHING: We should do!

01:33.280 --> 01:36.119
Right… Oh, erm…

01:36.120 --> 01:39.239
By the way, I've been feeling
really bad about that, erm,

01:39.240 --> 01:42.599
that dinner at yours. You don't have
to feel bad, you didn't do anything.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.199
No, I definitely think it was made
worse by me being there.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.240
How is everyone? How's Elliot?

01:49.320 --> 01:52.479
You know. Oh, speak of the
devil. MOBILE PHONE RINGS

01:52.480 --> 01:55.159
Sorry, just a sec.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.999
Hey, El. How you doing?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.079
The news? No.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.999
One second, please.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.559
No. Why, what's happening?

02:04.560 --> 02:06.600
Oh, my God.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.759
MAN: Bristol North MP
Graham Brannigan

02:11.760 --> 02:14.359
has resigned after a series
of allegations

02:14.360 --> 02:17.999
that he sent sexually explicit
messages to a female colleague.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.519
The messages were said to include
images of bestiality

02:21.520 --> 02:24.479
which the married father of two
reportedly sent

02:24.480 --> 02:27.239
in order to brag about the size
of his genitalia.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.279
I've just…I've just seen.
Oh, my God, this is excellent.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.639
Can we please call this "Horsegate"?

02:32.640 --> 02:35.759
I can't believe that.
Is Elliot going for it?

02:35.760 --> 02:38.159
I mean, you know, obviously,
it's not a done deal,

02:38.160 --> 02:40.279
but he met all the Westminster guys
at Conference

02:40.280 --> 02:42.879
and they're all behind him.
Wow, that's great.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.919
Yeah.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.439
Maybe I should put together, like,
a little evening, or something.

02:48.440 --> 02:51.079
Make sure he's got all their
support. Yes, definitely.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.560
Mm, just… OK, let me…

02:56.080 --> 02:59.119
Can I help at all? Oh, you're sweet.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.159
No, really. It would be great to
get a feel for the job.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.479
I'm actually OK with all the Elliot
stuff. But I do have a photoshoot

03:05.480 --> 03:08.319
with another client coming up
I could use your help with. Sure.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.079
Yeah? OK, great. Cool.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.279
You know, this is my time,

03:13.280 --> 03:15.759
and I am done apologising
for being ambitious.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.799
Yes, yes.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.159
Cheers to that. Cheers to that!

03:20.160 --> 03:22.319
Oh, hang on.
This is a good picture op.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.079
Oh, sorry, erm…

03:24.080 --> 03:26.239
No, do you mind…
Sorry, do you mind not?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.719
Oh, sure, sorry. What's…

03:28.720 --> 03:32.960
Erm, it's… Er, it's a crazy story,
really. Erm…

03:34.680 --> 03:36.720
I…I have a stalker.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.999
Oh, my God. That's so exciting. No.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.119
Er, it's just a guy I went on
a couple of dates with.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.399
Oh. Erm, yeah, when I had a profile,

03:46.400 --> 03:49.639
he would just show up at things
I was at

03:49.640 --> 03:51.999
pretending it was a coincidence.
Yeah.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.199
What the hell is wrong with people?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.440
I don't know, it's bizarre.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.879
Thanks, mate.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.639
For what?
You know, for staying with me.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.960
Oh, my God. I was literally in it
for your mum's fry up.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.160
Can't sleep? Nah.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.959
BABY CRIES IN THE DISTANCE

05:47.960 --> 05:50.000
Where's your sister?

05:52.360 --> 05:55.319
Mum.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.240
Mum. Where's your sister?
It's the neighbour's baby.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.159
Mum. Sas…

06:03.160 --> 06:05.199
Mum! Sasha!

06:05.200 --> 06:07.240
CRYING CONTINUES

06:23.560 --> 06:26.200
Mum, are you all right?
Don't…don't touch me.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.240
How long can you stay? Whenever.
My mum doesn't give a shit.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.560
WOMAN: Well, we're lucky
to have you.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.159
WOMAN: Breathe in…

07:03.160 --> 07:05.959
…and breathe out.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.799
Feel your breaths as a wave.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.000
Now, open your eyes.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.719
No, it's yesterday. What?

07:16.720 --> 07:19.400
Hey. Hey, nice to see you. Mm.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.439
She's a two-faced bitch.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.239
You look great, by the way.
Thank you, I feel better.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.279
Less groggy. What did I say?

07:29.280 --> 07:31.799
Have you got your membership yet?
No, not yet.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.960
OK, let's get it, come on.
No, Liv…

07:35.120 --> 07:38.359
Hi, Daph. Can I recommend this
amazing lady for membership, please?

07:38.360 --> 07:40.199
Er, Liv, I don't have my ID.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.799
It's OK, just put your name down
and secure the spot.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.519
I'll vouch for her.
I'd recommend that.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.239
We get a flurry of applications
around this time.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.879
OK, erm, Sasha Miles.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.119
I need to take a deposit.
The annual membership is £950.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.919
So it'll be 250 deposit. Great.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.520
Oh, Sash. Oh. Woo!

08:02.440 --> 08:05.799
Erm, Liv, would you mind filling
up my water bottle while I do this?

08:05.800 --> 08:07.839
Oh, yeah, sure. Thank you.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.959
Erm, I've been having some issues
with my bank.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.560
But if it doesn't go through, we can
just do it later. Yeah, no worries.

Sorry, can I get my card back?
We're in a bit of a rush.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.510
Of course, no problem. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.759
All good? Sorted. Great.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.679
Awesome, see you soon. Thanks, Daph.
Thank you, bye-bye.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.319
Fuck! What?

08:44.320 --> 08:46.959
You know the graphic designer
that I was really excited about,

08:46.960 --> 08:50.319
who was going to do the invites for
Elliot's thing then redo my website?

08:50.320 --> 08:52.399
Yeah. She's just pulled out,
the little ringworm.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.119
I'm so sorry. What am I meant
to do? Elliot's coming over.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.679
She was going to send me
the designs today.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.159
Well, don't panic.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.599
What is it you need done right now?
The invite design? Yeah.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.479
But I can do that.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.239
I did all the graphic design
for the gallery in Tokyo.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.319
Really? Yeah, of course.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.479
I mean, w-w-we could…we could try,
if you don't…

09:12.480 --> 09:15.719
It's fine. I can come to yours
if you like.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.799
Something like this, just simple.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.439
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.759
Let me send you the info that needs
to be in the design. OK.

You remember Sasha. Hi. Hi.

09:45.880 --> 09:49.679
She's helping me with the invites.
Great, thank you.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.399
No…no worries. Shall we…?
Er, it's fine.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.239
I can leave you to it.
No, we'll go to the stu…

09:55.240 --> 09:58.920
We'll go to the study.
Erm, I'll just grab my things.

I'll be OK.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.039
Yeah, I can imagine. I'm finding
the house hard to be in.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.039
It's full of her stuff.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.200
I know I should just
sort through it all.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.279
But I don't know. I can't face it.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.639
I keep avoiding it.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.590
Maybe it's comforting, or something.
Like she's still there.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.560
Like she could come home any moment.

You are a life-saver.

Mummy, can we play football?

11:14.640 --> 11:17.559
Mummy's just working right now.
Erm…

11:17.560 --> 11:20.079
Daddy, come play football.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.679
I don't think so, mate. Shall we go
and play upstairs instead? No!

11:23.680 --> 11:27.199
I just need 20 minutes to get these
invites out, then I'll do bath time.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.799
I can't have a work life.
OK, I'll do them tonight.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.199
I'm sorry. It's fine. Noah, shall we
do football later…?

11:32.200 --> 11:35.159
Guys, erm, I can…I can hang out
with them for a bit,

11:35.160 --> 11:36.799
just to give you guys a breather.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.159
Oh, my God, that would be amazing.
Do you mind?

11:39.160 --> 11:41.799
No, it's fine. Noah, do you want to
hang out? Yeah!

11:41.800 --> 11:45.639

Well, I'm going to play football.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.599
You are! I'll go and get dinner on,
or something. Thank you.

Oh, he's started.
But just…just 20 minutes.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.679
That's fine. And, erm, should I add
you to the guest list?

11:55.680 --> 11:57.719
Could be fun. Oh, yeah.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.399
Sure, why not? It's a week on
Friday? That's right. Sure.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.759

15:45.240 --> 15:47.919
He is relentlessly dull.

15:47.920 --> 15:53.159

And you said you didn't judge.

17:12.160 --> 17:15.679
We have so much fun, don't we?
Look, it's a work thing.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.880
You just get better opportunities
if you're their kind of person.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.639
You like the thrill of it,
don't you?

17:22.640 --> 17:25.159
Maybe you should try it. Hmm.

17:25.160 --> 17:29.879
Hello, Josh. Hey. I forgot to
tell you that Georgia's stopping by.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.839
Georgia? Georgia Cohen? Mm.
You know Georgia Cohen, don't you?

17:32.840 --> 17:35.679
Yeah, a little.
Wait, you know Georgia?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.799
Wow, you are so well connected.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.399
I think someone connected you while
you were working in Tokyo,

17:40.400 --> 17:43.119
didn't they? Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Oh, Tokyo.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.479
Where did you work at in Tokyo?

17:45.480 --> 17:47.839
A gallery. Mm.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.759
MAN: Hey! Oh, hello!

17:49.760 --> 17:53.000
Sasha, good to see you again.
Hi! Hi! Good to see you again.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.599
Good to see you.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.519
Sasha, what was the place called
that you were working at in Tokyo?

18:02.520 --> 18:04.679
Because I've travelled there
a few times.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.199
Er, it was called Takamori.
Takamori?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.240
Ah, I've actually been there.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.319
I'd love to go to Japan.
It sounds so…foreign.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.599
Oh, my God. I want to take you
there at some point. The sushi…

18:18.600 --> 18:21.199
…it's out of this world.
I'm pretty sure you're an expert.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.279
Right, Sasha?

18:23.280 --> 18:24.919
Yeah.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.999
Guys, Josh was actually just telling
me about college.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.639
In his senior year, he was in
a musical.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.919
Oh, I love musicals. Wow! Yes.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.319
What an image.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.119
Yeah, what musical was it?

18:37.120 --> 18:39.959
Erm… Thanks for, er…thanks
for asking.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.959
The m-musical was…

18:42.960 --> 18:45.799
…Cats. Oh, lovely, lovely.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.840
What part did you play?

18:49.760 --> 18:51.959
I played one of the cats.
Wait, wait, wait…

18:51.960 --> 18:53.679
Wait, what is it? Sing it. Erm…

18:53.680 --> 18:56.039
♪ The Rum Tum Tugger is… ♪
No. No, come on…

18:56.040 --> 18:57.959
Sing it, sing it! I'm not singing.
No.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.079
Yeah, stop being so weird.
I'm not singing.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.780
Let's go and get you a drink. Yeah.
For goodness' sake.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.559
WOMAN: Why was everyone
making fun of Cats?

19:07.560 --> 19:09.600
MAN: I don't know,
don't worry about it.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.119
Look, I-I'm really sorry about the
other day.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.270
You were right, I shouldn't have
been there.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.639
That's all right.
Sorry I kicked off.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.679
Yeah. HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

19:23.680 --> 19:25.719
I-It's fine.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.679
How are you feeling?

19:27.680 --> 19:29.840
Erm, you know…

19:31.680 --> 19:34.480
Better when I'm
drunk. THEY CHUCKLE

19:35.880 --> 19:39.359
I am sorry about your friend.
Thanks.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.520
It's shit. Yeah, I bet.

19:43.920 --> 19:48.239
I guess it's, like, when a friend
decides it's not worth living…

19:48.240 --> 19:51.079
E-Erm, sorry, I will be right…
Sorry, sorry. I will be…

19:51.080 --> 19:53.119
Georgia! Well, fuck you, then.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.799
Hi! Erm, I am Sasha. Sasha Miles.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.759
We met at those drinks at
the Academy a few weeks ago.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.239
I'm friends with Mark Peel. Erm…

20:03.240 --> 20:06.039
Mark's friend. Yes, yes.
Mm-hm. Are you in art?

20:06.040 --> 20:08.479
Er, I'm in marketing, but I work…
Hi. Hello.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.399
Sorry to interrupt. No, not at all.
Liv, this is Georgia.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.639
Georgia, this is Liv.
Liv organised all of this.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.119
So nice to meet you.
Thank you so much for coming.

20:17.120 --> 20:21.359
Liv's husband is actually a very
talented artist. Oh, really?

20:21.360 --> 20:24.439
He is brilliant. And I have to
listen to him snore every evening,

20:24.440 --> 20:26.519
so if anything,
I'm biased against him!

20:26.520 --> 20:28.359
I'll send you his stuff.
Yes, please.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.279
Did you ever manage to make it to
the David Cedric exhibition?

20:31.280 --> 20:34.039
Which one? You know, I organised
the opening last month.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.439
Sasha suggested you might be…
Yes, yes…

20:36.440 --> 20:39.799
Hi. Hi, hi.
Georgia, hey, how are you? Great.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.439
Good, it's good to see you.
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

20:42.440 --> 20:45.079
but my friend Pete Furman really
wants to say hi.

20:45.080 --> 20:48.639
Do you mind? Oh, God. This is why I
never enjoy my own events.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.919
So nice to meet you at last.
I'd love to see your husband's work.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.039
Oh, great. I'll sort it, no worries.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.880
See you later. Bye.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.199
Have you, erm, tried the canapes?

21:01.200 --> 21:05.080
Such fun meeting you. You too.
Have a lovely evening. Thanks, bye.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.120
Oh, sorry, thank you.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.759
Thank you for earlier.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.359
You are a maniac.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.519
It's been said. Mm.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.119
You two, I am keeping my eye on you.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.919
If you hurt my girl, I will strangle
you. Oh, I am terrified of you.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.520
Good, good. Now, go on, fuck off.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.280
I do think he likes you.
I don't know.

21:52.040 --> 21:56.639
Well, the vibe is excellent.
You have done an amazing job.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.680
Mm, thank you.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.879
Listen, so…

22:03.880 --> 22:06.759
…I've been thinking.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.199
Are you serious about a
career change?

22:10.200 --> 22:13.439
Yeah, I think so. I'm looking for
some help, basically.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.679
I mean, obviously, hold on to
your job for now,

22:15.680 --> 22:18.960
but if you enjoy it, I am looking to
expand my company.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.399
Erm… Well, it was just an idea.
There's no rush. No, Liv, I-I…

22:25.400 --> 22:27.439
I would…I would love that.

22:27.440 --> 22:30.159
OK, great. Well, let's talk
about it.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.200
OK. THEY CHUCKLE

22:34.640 --> 22:37.879
It's…It's been really nice
to have a friend

22:37.880 --> 22:40.359
since I got back,

22:40.360 --> 22:43.199
so thank you for taking me in.
Oh, Sasha, Sasha, Sasha, Sasha.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.879
I hate most people.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.280
Really? I do, but, erm…

22:50.720 --> 22:53.080
…it's nice to find someone good.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.039
I mean it.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.080
LIV CHUCKLES LIGHTLY

23:11.200 --> 23:14.679
You know, erm, with Alex… Mm.

23:14.680 --> 23:19.239
In the last few months, it's just
felt like we weren't…

23:19.240 --> 23:21.719
…as close.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.439
I just feel really bad about it

23:23.440 --> 23:26.040
because she should've been able to
talk to me. Uh-uh.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.370
No, you can't blame yourself.
You didn't know.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.559
I saw Chloe all the time
but I don't think

23:36.560 --> 23:38.910
that we'd been proper friends
for several years.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.920
It was like she was always
out of reach.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.480
But you seemed so close.
What do you mean?

23:47.440 --> 23:49.520
Just… Just from what you've said.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.839
We were. And it was amazing.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.519
Erm… LIV CLEARS HER THROAT

23:56.520 --> 23:58.680
But then she retreated from us all.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.400
And I think she resented me.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.679
Then she tried to be a journalist
and that never worked out,

24:07.680 --> 24:10.119
then the kids. It was…

24:10.120 --> 24:12.159
LIV SIGHS

24:12.160 --> 24:14.200
The kids?

24:16.320 --> 24:18.520
It just makes me really sad.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.720
No, me too.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.839
GLASS CLINKS

24:26.840 --> 24:28.680
I should, er…

24:32.120 --> 24:35.519
I'm sorry for interrupting you all,

24:35.520 --> 24:40.479
but it's time for me to let
the proverbial cat out of the bag.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.159
The horse, you mean. LAUGHTER

24:43.160 --> 24:46.279
Some of you may already have heard

24:46.280 --> 24:50.639
that, er, I'm not running in
the upcoming election.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.799
It's time for some young blood.

24:52.800 --> 24:58.359
And in the next three weeks, we will
all be voting for a new candidate.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.999
Now, I have known him for…
Well, many years.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.039
And I can honestly say I have never
met anyone

25:06.040 --> 25:09.879
more inspiring and more
hard-working

25:09.880 --> 25:13.839
and with greater integrity

25:13.840 --> 25:17.399
than Elliot Fairbourne.

25:17.400 --> 25:23.279
I'll be endorsing him and I hope you
will all join me in doing so.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.759
So please raise your glass
to Elliot.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.880
ALL: To Elliot. APPLAUSE

25:31.640 --> 25:33.280
INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS

25:38.360 --> 25:41.810
You're going to have to wade through
all those vultures to get to him.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.559
What the hell are you talking about?

25:44.560 --> 25:48.039
You do know his wife killed herself,
right?

25:48.040 --> 25:50.399
Yeah. Oh.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.840
Did you know her?
I met her a few times.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.039
And? Well, I liked her.
I was surprised when I heard.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.680
Why?

26:00.760 --> 26:02.400
I don't know.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.880
It's awful.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.999
Be careful.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.439
What do you mean? Well…

26:13.440 --> 26:15.740
WHISPERING: …it's always
the husband, isn't it?

26:17.320 --> 26:19.360
WHISPERING: I'm going to get
a drink.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.800
Hi.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.879
No, of course. Thanks very much.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.319
Pleasure, cheers. Be in touch.

26:31.320 --> 26:34.119
I'm not going to bother you,
I just think you need that.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.879
Very thoughtful of you.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.119
How's your evening?
Not too boring, I hope.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.760
No, not at all. Your friends are
the best.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.199
I don't know about that.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.439
Listen, sorry about
the other evening.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.279
It must've been a bit intense. No.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.160
It's fine. Honestly, I-I get it.

26:59.040 --> 27:02.119
We need to keep talking or someone's
going to jump in.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.879
Oh, right. Erm, er…
Well, that's ideal,

27:04.880 --> 27:08.519
because I was hoping to get a moment
to discuss my bid for sanitation.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.799
Oh, were you now? Yes.
That's very interesting.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.039
Tell me more.
I'm very serious about sanitation.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.359
Erm, congratulations.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.999
Thank you.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.319
Yeah, I-I bet it's…

27:19.320 --> 27:20.919
…complicated.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.559
It is that. Fairbourne.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.599
Good to see you. Told you.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.599
Yes. I'd like you to meet someone.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.640
Hi, hello. Pleased to meet you.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.359
So, has the unstoppable force
finally met the immovable object?

27:36.360 --> 27:37.999
Shut up.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.159
Look, I'm bored, I'm going to split.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.159
But want to sneak out the back
and go play some foosball?

27:43.160 --> 27:45.200
I know a really good place.
No, sorry.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.159
Look, I'm going to tell you again.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.999
It's not going to happen.
Dinner's on you if you're wrong.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.040
Win-win.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.000
INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS

28:21.440 --> 28:25.479
You, erm… You don't happen to have
a spare one, do you?

28:25.480 --> 28:29.520
I'm trying to give up,
but not tonight.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.360
Don't waste too much energy
doing that.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.720
I mean, I don't really.

28:38.680 --> 28:43.480
God, I loathe the fact that smoking
has become so uncool. Mm.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.600
It's your generation's fault,
you know.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.799
"No, it's wrong.
Don't do that, it's bad for you."

28:51.800 --> 28:53.959
THEY LAUGH

28:53.960 --> 28:56.479
Most fun things are.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.639
Exactly.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.920
It's why they're so delicious.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.999
Your son did a wonderful
job tonight.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.640
It must've been hard.

29:12.600 --> 29:16.119
Poor boy has been hounded all night.

29:16.120 --> 29:20.199
And I promised that I'd help him
make a French exit.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.240
Do you mind? No.

29:28.120 --> 29:33.160
Hello, hi. Erm, can I have a taxi,
please, for Elliot Fairbourne.

29:36.760 --> 29:40.520
The Berkeley's Club. 20 minutes?
Great, thank you, bye.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.800
I must go and find him.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.600
Erm, could I steal
another cigarette?

29:56.960 --> 29:59.000
I'll leave you to your fun.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.800
No, no, really, take it.
Oh, thanks so much.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.600
Sasha, hi. Hey.

30:51.400 --> 30:55.519
I abandoned you in there, didn't I?

30:55.520 --> 30:59.800
Don't worry, you have much more
important people to talk to.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.800
You read my mind.

31:14.160 --> 31:16.400
God, they taste good, don't they?

31:19.920 --> 31:22.319
How are you?

31:22.320 --> 31:23.960
I'm fine.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.120
How are you, really?

31:30.360 --> 31:33.599
Well, I've spent all of this evening

31:33.600 --> 31:37.839
listening to what people want
from me if I win the seat.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.239
And I already feel like I'm

31:40.240 --> 31:42.360
fighting not to compromise.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.000
Well, make sure you do.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.760
Fight.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.719
Where is this bloody taxi?

31:57.720 --> 31:59.559
There was one here just now.

31:59.560 --> 32:02.879
Er, it was waiting for quite a while
but just left.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.079
Oh, shit.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.799
Erm, I'm just about to drive home.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.840
Where do you live?

32:14.400 --> 32:18.600
I had a long relationship in Tokyo,
but, erm, it didn't work out.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.280
Why not?

32:25.160 --> 32:26.959
Erm…

32:26.960 --> 32:29.360
…I don't know. They ghosted me.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.599
I'm sorry.

32:33.600 --> 32:37.519
Not getting any answers to your
questions is a really hard thing.

32:37.520 --> 32:41.120
Yeah. You start filling in
the blanks yourself. Mm.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.679
I should've seen it coming.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.720
I think I'm just very trusting.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.840
Very stupid.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.719
Or you're just a better person
than most. Oh, no.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.840
THEY CHUCKLE

33:00.640 --> 33:02.680
Oh, it's just here on the left.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.959
BRAKES SQUEAL Fuck!

33:18.960 --> 33:22.079
Shit. What happened? Sorry, yeah…

33:22.080 --> 33:25.200
There was a badger.
God, are you OK? Did you see it?

33:41.280 --> 33:43.319
Are you sure you're OK?

33:43.320 --> 33:46.480
Yeah, sorry.
I hate country lanes at night.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.679
I actually think I might have had
one too many.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.359
Do you want to come in for
a glass of water?

33:53.360 --> 33:55.479
Oh, I don't… It's fine.

33:55.480 --> 33:57.520
Come in.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.440
Er, just through here.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.560
You have a lovely home. Thank you.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.279
Here you are. Thank you.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.799
Do you, erm… Do you fancy
a coffee?

35:07.800 --> 35:09.840
Oh, God, yes, please.

35:16.680 --> 35:20.280
When was your mum diagnosed?
Three years ago.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.160
Yeah, it's, erm…

35:25.960 --> 35:28.000
It's been a bad time.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.640
Just kind of dark.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.879
Yeah.

35:34.880 --> 35:38.599
The last few months have been
pretty dark for me, too.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.839
Very grateful for friends
at the moment.

35:41.840 --> 35:45.639
Olivia tells me you lost a friend.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.200
Yeah. Were you close?

35:49.840 --> 35:52.120
I was the last person she called.

35:54.920 --> 35:59.080
Strange, I hate talking about this
stuff with most people.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.000
No, me too.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.319
How are you feeling?
Yeah, I… Sorry.

36:06.320 --> 36:09.759
Oh, don't be. Will you be all right
getting home?

36:09.760 --> 36:11.519
Erm…

36:11.520 --> 36:14.479
Erm, I might have another,
just to be safe.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.639
But you…you go to bed.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.279
No, look, it's fine. It's late.
Maybe you shouldn't drive home.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.679
If you want to stay, the spare
room's made up.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.119
It's just through there.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.760
I don't want to get in the way.
Honestly, it's fine.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.040
And she was, like… THEY LAUGH

39:27.480 --> 39:29.599
It's all right, Mum.

39:29.600 --> 39:33.239
Fuck him, Ange.
You're better off without him.

39:33.240 --> 39:36.319
I know, I know.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.160
How long can you stay?

40:06.840 --> 40:08.880
CREAKING

40:24.720 --> 40:26.760
CLATTERING Fuck!

40:47.200 --> 40:49.719
Sasha?

40:49.720 --> 40:53.999
Sorry, I-I was looking
for the bathroom.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.839
What are you doing?
I-I…I got lost.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.359
Sorry. God…

41:01.360 --> 41:04.879
…it's really bad. I'm so sorry.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.159
What a mess.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.799
Here, here.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.679

It is OK, you can talk to me.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.320
It's just been so lonely.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.400
She was so depressed.

43:12.440 --> 43:14.760
I just…I just keep thinking…

43:16.960 --> 43:19.760
…I-I should have stopped it.

43:21.200 --> 43:24.240
You did everything.
I-I should have…

43:25.320 --> 43:27.760
…I don't know, insisted on more
therapy, or…

43:29.200 --> 43:31.240
…or something.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.120
I had thought the antidepressants
were working.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.680
How long had she been depressed for?

43:45.680 --> 43:47.720
A long time.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.440
We'd been trying for…

43:53.720 --> 43:55.760
We'd been trying to get pregnant…

43:57.640 --> 43:59.680
…for about a year.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.400
She really wanted it.

44:07.240 --> 44:09.280
It was hard.

44:10.240 --> 44:15.000
You know, seeing all our friends
starting families.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.480
We were about to start IVF.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.200
I thought she was managing, but…

44:28.600 --> 44:30.640
…I-I completely just fucked up.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.839
You didn't know.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.000
That's the thing, though. I-I did.

44:39.280 --> 44:43.400
She'd been behaving weirdly
for ages.

44:46.360 --> 44:48.400
On the night…

44:49.920 --> 44:53.439
On the night it happened…

44:53.440 --> 44:55.720
…I knew something was really wrong.

44:58.680 --> 45:01.080
I just… I didn't think she…

45:03.440 --> 45:05.480
W-Where were you?

45:07.080 --> 45:11.080
Er, I was giving a speech at some
charity thing.

45:14.480 --> 45:17.840
She was there and she just got up
and left.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.160
Just walked out, didn't say
anything.

45:22.240 --> 45:25.080
And then she put this post
up online.

45:27.160 --> 45:30.440
I sort of panicked. It was tagged
Brandon Hill.

45:32.520 --> 45:36.079
So we all started running around
looking for her.

45:36.080 --> 45:38.199
Did you find her?

45:38.200 --> 45:39.840
No.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.480
She'd gone to her parents' house.

45:45.160 --> 45:47.920
They called me up and told me to
come straight over.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.480
I did.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.839
I remember thinking…

45:57.840 --> 45:59.920
"Everything's going to be fine."

46:04.360 --> 46:06.400
What happened?

46:08.120 --> 46:10.840
In the middle of the night,
I realised she was gone.

46:13.320 --> 46:17.399
So…so her mum and I got in the car
and drove around for ages

46:17.400 --> 46:19.440
looking for her.

46:23.680 --> 46:26.880
We got there just as she
was about…

46:29.280 --> 46:31.320
…in her pyjamas.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.920
SOBBING: She wasn't wearing a coat.

46:44.440 --> 46:46.560

Like everything isn't shit.
