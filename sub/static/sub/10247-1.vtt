02:01.973 --> 02:03.122
Bobby.

02:04.013 --> 02:05.162
Bobby.

02:05.973 --> 02:07.122
No!

03:29.093 --> 03:30.606
All right, we lined up?

03:31.253 --> 03:32.845
Get that line.

03:40.213 --> 03:42.852
Put the stern line on quick.

04:04.053 --> 04:05.406
Bobby!

04:09.613 --> 04:11.046
Hey, baby!

04:19.452 --> 04:20.601
Missed you.

04:25.853 --> 04:27.969
Hey, big man, how you doing?

04:34.773 --> 04:37.003
- Hey, Murph!
- Hey, Ethel.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.051
How you doing? Welcome home.

04:39.253 --> 04:41.323
- You seen Deb and my boy?
- No, I'm sorry.

04:41.573 --> 04:42.562
Ma!

04:44.733 --> 04:47.008
- How you doing, beautiful?
- Hello, Bobby.

04:49.093 --> 04:50.572
Home safe.

04:57.733 --> 04:58.848
Who's that?

05:00.373 --> 05:02.284
- OI' Ben.
- No.

05:03.213 --> 05:04.646
Poor old guy.

05:05.893 --> 05:07.008
Hey, Linda.

05:07.893 --> 05:09.884
- Hey, boss.
- What's the score?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.128
My kind of numbers.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.642
I lost Ben Pulley.
He passed away onboard.

05:18.973 --> 05:20.565
Sorry to hear that.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.332
How'd you hit it, Billy?

05:24.933 --> 05:26.605
Didn't hit very hard, did you?

05:26.813 --> 05:29.646
We all have slumps, but you're overdue
to break out of yours.

05:29.853 --> 05:32.162
Did you hear the lady?
Ben Pulley's dead.

05:32.373 --> 05:36.605
That old man pickled himself to death
drinking 7 & 7s chasing Narragansetts.

05:36.813 --> 05:40.852
Linda, with Ben, it was never
a question of "if," but "when."

05:41.493 --> 05:43.290
- I'll bury him.
- I'll pay for it.

05:43.733 --> 05:45.132
See, you got what you wanted.

05:45.693 --> 05:48.730
Bring in your fish.
It shouldn't take too long.

07:09.173 --> 07:10.811
8-5.

07:16.813 --> 07:18.132
4-7-5.

07:38.733 --> 07:39.722
Murph.

07:41.733 --> 07:43.166
Sign my ledger.

07:45.013 --> 07:46.162
Shatford.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.606
Sign my ledger.

07:53.813 --> 07:54.802
What's the matter?

07:55.013 --> 07:56.810
It's $2221.
Aren't we a little short?

07:59.733 --> 08:02.406
We were sharing up last night.
I thought it'd be three plus.

08:05.173 --> 08:09.724
You stocked 21,000 pounds at 3.50
a pound. That comes to $ 73,000.

08:09.973 --> 08:14.410
Minus $35,000 for bait, tackle, fuel.
That comes out to $38,500.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.166
I get half. I own the boat.

08:16.373 --> 08:19.046
Your captain takes double share,
four crewmen get a share each.

08:19.253 --> 08:21.813
And a rookie like you,
three-quarters share.

08:22.013 --> 08:24.971
That comes to $2221.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.926
What it is, is what it is.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.732
Sign the ledger.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.248
Moran.

08:40.373 --> 08:42.568
You going out again this season,
skipper?

08:42.773 --> 08:43.842
Why?

08:45.253 --> 08:46.606
You got a site in Florida?

08:49.053 --> 08:50.452
Bradenton Beach.

08:51.493 --> 08:52.812
The <i>Cecile.</i>

08:54.173 --> 08:56.004
Pack your shit and get out.

08:57.613 --> 08:59.012
You like Florida?

09:00.093 --> 09:02.561
Well, it beats the Grand Banks
in October.

09:03.173 --> 09:06.290
It gets rough up here,
Dougie likes the sun down there.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.329
Or he thinks he'll score better
with another captain.

09:09.693 --> 09:10.728
I didn't say that.

09:11.293 --> 09:12.646
Yes, you did.

09:14.333 --> 09:15.288
Goodbye.

09:16.453 --> 09:21.083
Here's your cut. $5923.76.
Sign the ledger.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.249
That's a record low for you,
isn't it?

09:24.693 --> 09:27.810
Next time, track Linda.
She'll take you where the fish are.

09:28.773 --> 09:30.843
You're getting to be rude, you know?

09:31.133 --> 09:33.522
I like you, Billy.
I always have.

09:33.733 --> 09:35.132
But I like my boat better.

09:35.333 --> 09:38.291
If you can't make it pay,
I'll find somebody who can.

09:38.773 --> 09:40.570
You trying to put a charge up my ass?

09:41.493 --> 09:43.211
You're on a cold streak.

09:43.413 --> 09:45.210
I'm encouraging you
to catch fish.

09:45.413 --> 09:47.722
I'll bring you more fish
than you ever dreamed of.

09:47.933 --> 09:50.572
Next time I fish the Grand Banks,
they won't be so grand.

09:50.773 --> 09:52.604
You just struck out
on the Grand Banks.

09:52.813 --> 09:53.882
Then I'll go further.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.567
Don't even think about it.
I want my boat back.

09:58.773 --> 10:00.570
And I want to catch some fish.

10:00.773 --> 10:01.728
It's what I do.

10:02.373 --> 10:03.328
Not lately.

10:03.573 --> 10:05.803
Want to yank my site, you go ahead.

10:24.773 --> 10:27.082
- Murph.
- Hey, skip.

10:29.173 --> 10:31.846
What are you doing out here?
Get in there. Get drunk.

10:32.493 --> 10:34.131
Waiting on my ex...

10:34.693 --> 10:35.921
...and my son.

10:40.253 --> 10:42.767
Give him lots of
hugs and kisses tonight.

10:43.653 --> 10:46.292
You don't gotta remind me
to do that, skip.

10:49.933 --> 10:52.083
Ladies, you're looking fine.
How you doing?

10:52.293 --> 10:54.727
Can I buy you a drink?
What, what, what?

11:01.253 --> 11:02.686
Hey, rookie.

11:04.693 --> 11:06.206
What are you so happy about?

11:07.293 --> 11:10.285
It wasn't exactly a slammer
up on the Grand Banks.

11:10.493 --> 11:12.085
Isn't it past your bedtime?

11:13.893 --> 11:15.565
Bugs, how you making out?

11:15.773 --> 11:17.047
I'm not.

11:19.173 --> 11:21.482
I don't know.
Maybe I smell like fish.

11:21.733 --> 11:24.884
- You need a new deodorant.
- Maybe I need a new face.

11:27.893 --> 11:30.043
Frickin' Alfred Pierre.

11:31.213 --> 11:35.001
They were upstairs, they come down,
a little refreshment.

11:35.213 --> 11:37.010
Now they're going back up again.

11:37.213 --> 11:39.773
Half an hour ago, they shook
the lamps over the bar.

11:39.973 --> 11:43.602
Last time she brought her sister.
You should've seen the lamps then.

11:45.453 --> 11:47.205
How do he do it, mon?

11:47.413 --> 11:50.132
I think he's fishin'
with a longer pole, Bugs.

12:00.773 --> 12:01.808
What happened?

12:02.013 --> 12:05.926
They had a sale on kids' shoes
at Ames.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.248
Sorry.

12:08.613 --> 12:09.932
No problem.

12:10.853 --> 12:11.649
Hi.

12:12.293 --> 12:13.487
Hello.

12:16.253 --> 12:17.971
So you want to have a drink?

12:20.613 --> 12:21.648
Come on, Debra.

12:21.853 --> 12:23.730
What do you say, for old times' sake?

12:23.933 --> 12:26.003
It was the old times that killed us.

12:28.653 --> 12:29.847
Is that what it was?

12:33.333 --> 12:34.561
There you go.

12:35.253 --> 12:37.687
I'm a little short.
It wasn't exactly a slammer.

12:38.613 --> 12:39.568
Half for you.

12:41.573 --> 12:42.483
You sure?

12:42.733 --> 12:43.768
Yeah, I'm working.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.652
Want to come with your daddy?

12:52.573 --> 12:53.892
Shoot some pool?

12:56.213 --> 12:57.646
Have a drink?

13:03.253 --> 13:05.244
Just bring him home in an hour.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.605
Good shot, buddy.

13:25.893 --> 13:28.361
All right, Sully, you think about it.

13:28.613 --> 13:29.682
All right?

13:32.893 --> 13:34.406
Bugs.

13:36.493 --> 13:37.721
Murph, come here.

13:37.933 --> 13:40.652
Here comes your fearless leader,
Captain Billy Tyne.

13:40.853 --> 13:43.606
I got a feeling skipper's
coming to give us bad news.

13:45.093 --> 13:47.402
Lady's not only pretty, she's smart.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.971
Yeah, we're going back out.

13:51.693 --> 13:53.012
What'd I tell you?

13:54.693 --> 13:56.604
- When?
- A few days.

13:56.813 --> 13:57.962
"Few" means two?

13:58.493 --> 13:59.482
Two days is right.

13:59.733 --> 14:01.291
Skip, we just got back in.

14:01.493 --> 14:04.007
You don't want your site,
a replacement's a call away.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.208
Join me, don't join me.

14:09.653 --> 14:12.213
There's time for one last shot.
The <i>Andrea Gail</i> will take it.

14:12.413 --> 14:15.849
This time I promise you, we'll
come back with a shitload of fish.

14:16.253 --> 14:17.891
Excuse me, men, madam.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.841
What are you gonna do?

14:25.333 --> 14:28.211
I'm gonna tell him to
stick his head up his ass.

14:28.453 --> 14:29.772
I'd like to hear that.

14:30.693 --> 14:31.648
Hear what?

14:31.853 --> 14:34.287
I'd like to hear you tell him
to stick it up his ass.

14:34.493 --> 14:35.721
Go on, Bob.

14:40.253 --> 14:43.848
Yeah, that's just how I'll tell him
as soon as we get back.

14:44.053 --> 14:45.566
You're a bastard.

14:46.133 --> 14:48.283
Why? Why do I even love you?

14:48.493 --> 14:50.165
- Come on.
- No. Why? Why, Bobby?

14:50.693 --> 14:53.491
When you get the answer, tell me.
I could use it myself.

14:53.933 --> 14:56.572
- Get laid, Bugsy.
- Easy for you to say.

15:05.453 --> 15:06.727
Go on up there.

15:06.933 --> 15:08.651
Don't make the same mistake I did.

15:18.373 --> 15:20.284
You're going away again?

15:22.573 --> 15:23.801
Yeah.

15:24.373 --> 15:26.329
Take me with you.

15:30.133 --> 15:31.361
Come here.

15:34.653 --> 15:35.608
Go back, Bobby.

15:36.613 --> 15:38.968
Go back to what you did before.

15:39.173 --> 15:42.085
- Pack cod, repair tackle.
- I'm sick of that.

15:42.573 --> 15:44.052
It's safe and it pays.

15:44.853 --> 15:46.127
Not enough.

15:46.773 --> 15:48.729
Just one more time. I promise.

15:49.013 --> 15:51.607
I have to try it again.
We need the money, baby.

15:51.813 --> 15:54.281
Money. It's always about the money.

15:55.093 --> 15:59.086
Well, I got a divorce lawyer,
a mountain of debt.

16:00.573 --> 16:03.849
And there's your two kids.
You gotta get them back.

16:06.053 --> 16:07.805
Do you think you'll love them?

16:08.133 --> 16:09.805
They're yours, aren't they?

16:28.893 --> 16:30.292
Hey, beautiful.

16:30.613 --> 16:31.682
Yeah, you.

16:32.773 --> 16:34.206
Buy you a drink?

16:35.413 --> 16:37.927
Seeing as I got two in front of me,
I don't think so.

16:38.813 --> 16:40.724
I'm not very observant, am I?

16:41.973 --> 16:45.124
I got a feeling, yeah,
along with a lot of other things.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.005
Why don't we start over?

16:48.213 --> 16:51.205
You know what would look good on you?
Me.

16:54.173 --> 16:55.401
No good?

16:59.253 --> 17:01.483
Have a drink. It's not that bad.

17:03.973 --> 17:05.884
Thank you. Here's to crime.

17:12.093 --> 17:13.685
You're pathetic.

17:16.853 --> 17:18.491
You still want to be a fisherman?

17:18.733 --> 17:21.166
Who told you I wanted to be
a fisherman?

17:21.573 --> 17:22.892
You want to come with me.

17:23.093 --> 17:26.368
I want to come with you,
but I don't want to be a fisherman.

17:31.053 --> 17:32.611
You know, buddy...

17:34.813 --> 17:38.249
...one of these days your mom's
gonna find you a new dad.

17:38.453 --> 17:40.569
I don't want a new dad.

17:40.773 --> 17:41.888
I'm sorry.

17:42.093 --> 17:44.766
Your mom can't sit around
by herself all the time.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.164
She isn't sitting around.

18:03.733 --> 18:05.644
I'm sure he's a good guy.

18:06.733 --> 18:10.009
I know your mom wouldn't take up
with anybody but a good guy.

18:13.733 --> 18:15.212
And you know, buddy...

18:15.893 --> 18:19.010
...the most important thing is
that you and Mommy are happy.

18:20.293 --> 18:23.251
Can we talk about something else now?

18:34.293 --> 18:36.363
I miss you too, buddy.

18:42.293 --> 18:44.602
I miss you so damn much.

18:46.253 --> 18:48.926
What'd you say your name was again?

18:49.453 --> 18:51.409
Irene. Is that so tough?

18:51.613 --> 18:53.205
I'm sorry. Listen.

18:54.653 --> 18:56.609
Could I maybe take you home?

18:57.573 --> 18:58.483
I don't think so.

18:59.613 --> 19:03.652
I came to watch the game. Instead I
got schnockered with Bugsy.

19:05.293 --> 19:07.932
- What does Bugsy stand for anyway?
- Michael.

19:08.573 --> 19:10.848
That's a nice name.
Why don't you use it?

19:11.253 --> 19:12.845
Because people know me as Bugsy.

19:15.293 --> 19:17.682
I'm gonna shove off now.
Big day tomorrow.

19:17.893 --> 19:20.327
I can't take you home?

19:20.573 --> 19:22.131
What, in a wheelbarrow?

19:22.333 --> 19:24.164
Crew guys like you never have cars.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.887
Lay off. I got feelings too.

19:27.093 --> 19:29.926
Where, down in your pants?

19:31.133 --> 19:34.170
Jesus, lady, where's the passion
in your life?

19:34.373 --> 19:36.329
Home in bed.

19:36.613 --> 19:38.888
One of them's 6, the other one's 8.

19:40.453 --> 19:43.490
All I can say is,
there's some lucky kids.

19:44.253 --> 19:45.606
They got a wonderful mother.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.089
You're not messing with me, are you?

19:55.133 --> 19:57.363
Haven't got time.
We're going out in two days.

19:58.973 --> 20:01.203
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Michael.

20:02.693 --> 20:04.012
Gotta go.

20:05.693 --> 20:06.967
What do you mean?

20:09.093 --> 20:10.685
- Where you going?
- Have these.

20:10.893 --> 20:12.451
- Thank you.
- See you.

20:16.213 --> 20:18.249
- Bye, Ethel.
- See you.

20:35.613 --> 20:36.602
Watch your step.

20:46.253 --> 20:48.005
I smell Coppertone.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.090
That means that
Captain Linda Greenlaw...

20:50.293 --> 20:53.410
...a lady vain about her nose,
is in my wheelhouse.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.927
Make that Hawaiian Tropic.

20:55.133 --> 20:57.124
At least I got the nose right.

20:58.213 --> 21:00.807
Your guys are loading bait
and groceries.

21:01.853 --> 21:04.686
- You doing a turnaround?
- No rest for the weary.

21:04.893 --> 21:07.043
There you go.
Flaunting your work ethic.

21:07.373 --> 21:09.443
I don't have a work ethic.
I just have work.

21:09.693 --> 21:11.445
If I'm gonna catch up to you.

21:12.493 --> 21:14.165
I love to watch you study charts.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.647
Why?

21:16.053 --> 21:17.486
You know them all by heart.

21:18.493 --> 21:21.212
What's special about today
that you're blowing smoke up my ass?

21:21.413 --> 21:22.687
I thought I'd make a pass.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.923
You see, I'm looking for a guy
to come home to Maine with me...

21:30.133 --> 21:31.566
...buy a house and raise kids.

21:31.773 --> 21:33.604
What does that guy and you do after?

21:35.053 --> 21:38.170
The thing is, I'm happy.
I'm happy I'm fit to do this.

21:38.373 --> 21:40.409
I just don't see the romance in it.

21:40.653 --> 21:43.406
But you've got it, Captain Greenlaw.

21:43.853 --> 21:45.491
You do. Believe me.

21:45.693 --> 21:47.365
I've seen them come and go.

21:47.613 --> 21:50.923
The day I laid eyes on you, I said,
"She's gonna be a good one."

21:51.573 --> 21:53.325
You can't be good unless you love it.

21:55.813 --> 21:57.485
The fog's just lifting.

21:58.853 --> 22:01.242
You throw off your bow line,
throw off your stern.

22:02.813 --> 22:04.610
You head out the South Channel...

22:04.813 --> 22:07.930
...past Rocky Neck,
Ten Pound Island...

22:08.773 --> 22:11.890
...past Niles Pond,
where I skated as a kid.

22:12.613 --> 22:13.728
Blow your horn...

22:13.933 --> 22:16.891
...and wave to the lighthouse
keeper's kid on Thatcher Island.

22:17.773 --> 22:19.252
Then the birds show up.

22:19.453 --> 22:20.966
Black-backs...

22:21.213 --> 22:24.011
...herring gulls, big dump ducks.

22:25.773 --> 22:27.172
The sun hits you.

22:27.373 --> 22:29.967
Head north, open up to 12.

22:31.013 --> 22:32.002
You're steaming now.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.691
The guys are busy,
you're in charge.

22:36.933 --> 22:40.084
You know what?
You're a goddamn swordboat captain.

22:43.093 --> 22:45.209
Is there anything better in the world?

22:58.053 --> 22:59.088
Sully.

23:02.173 --> 23:03.925
So what do you think?

23:08.093 --> 23:09.162
You been busy?

23:09.373 --> 23:10.726
Busy enough.

23:10.933 --> 23:13.493
I was working menhaden in Annisquam.

23:13.853 --> 23:15.764
But they laid off Labor Day.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.891
Mended nets over in Fairhaven.

23:18.093 --> 23:20.812
That's crap.
What's this you're doing now?

23:22.133 --> 23:23.407
Helping out a friend.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.006
He paying you?

23:25.573 --> 23:27.086
He's my friend.

23:31.333 --> 23:32.812
Murphy keep his site?

23:36.453 --> 23:38.091
You want this job or not?

23:39.893 --> 23:41.087
I do.

24:44.053 --> 24:46.851
Lord, did I do that?

24:49.293 --> 24:50.646
Yeah, you did.

24:51.693 --> 24:55.368
But I'm not completely blind.
I can still see out of the other one.

24:56.573 --> 24:57.767
Next time I should break a leg.

24:57.973 --> 25:00.567
Then you can stay home
and collect disability.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.652
Think of all those
handicapped parking spaces.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.969
Tell me last night was worth it.

25:09.653 --> 25:11.291
I can't remember.

25:11.933 --> 25:14.367
Can't remember, my ass.

25:14.653 --> 25:16.883
No, I remember your ass.

25:18.973 --> 25:20.770
Last night was worth it.

25:21.773 --> 25:23.252
There's nothing like
sleeping with you.

25:24.973 --> 25:26.326
Just sleeping...

25:26.693 --> 25:28.365
...lying next to you...

25:29.293 --> 25:31.045
...all warm and sweet.

25:31.773 --> 25:34.287
And me wishing the morning
would never come.

25:43.893 --> 25:45.372
Catching up.

25:50.293 --> 25:53.365
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Look at that shiner.

25:53.613 --> 25:54.966
Come on, Murph, will you?

25:56.453 --> 25:58.444
Good morning.
Where'd you get the mouse?

25:58.693 --> 26:00.490
Chris "Boom-Boom" Cotter.

26:03.053 --> 26:05.851
Put some hair around that hole,
I bet you could hit it.

26:06.853 --> 26:10.448
Not with a pool cue,
or any other pointed instrument.

26:12.773 --> 26:16.482
What do you know except to cut squid
and take them to bed with you?

26:18.693 --> 26:21.253
Ethel, where you getting
your customers these days?

26:21.453 --> 26:22.966
The welfare office?

26:23.693 --> 26:25.843
Who gave you that scar, tough guy?

26:26.693 --> 26:28.445
Back off! Back off.

26:28.653 --> 26:29.768
Come on, swing it.

26:30.093 --> 26:31.446
You assholes!

26:33.693 --> 26:37.732
How you gonna act onboard if you're
already at each other's throats?

26:37.933 --> 26:38.922
All right, Ma.

26:41.013 --> 26:42.571
See you onboard.

26:47.173 --> 26:50.085
- Alfred Pierre, one for the road?
- No, tanks, Mom.

26:50.613 --> 26:53.730
"No, tanks, Mom."
Guy can't even speak good English.

26:53.933 --> 26:55.969
Well, anyway, can I get you anything?

26:56.173 --> 26:57.447
Let's go, boys.

26:59.293 --> 27:01.488
I'll wait for you in the car, Bobby.

27:03.173 --> 27:06.131
Catch fish, boys. Lots of them.
Full ahead.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.324
Hold down the fort, Quentin.

27:08.573 --> 27:09.801
Thanks, Q.

27:10.373 --> 27:11.442
Thanks, Ethel.

27:15.253 --> 27:16.652
Gotta go, Mom.

27:19.093 --> 27:20.765
The Grand Banks.

27:21.373 --> 27:22.601
I know.

27:22.813 --> 27:25.930
Grand Banks are no joke in October.
All right?

27:29.133 --> 27:30.407
Be careful.

28:07.733 --> 28:09.803
At least we'll get cancer together.

28:15.093 --> 28:17.163
I can't put it off any longer.

28:18.053 --> 28:20.009
I'm not too big on goodbyes.

28:22.613 --> 28:26.128
Don't go, Bobby. I got a bad feeling.

28:27.613 --> 28:29.126
I've been thinking about it.

28:29.773 --> 28:32.048
Then for God's sake, don't go.

28:32.253 --> 28:34.084
I'll moonlight, I'll sell the car.

28:34.293 --> 28:36.249
We'll work nights, weekends.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.809
Whatever it takes, little by little,
we'll put something away.

28:45.853 --> 28:47.252
I gotta go.

28:55.973 --> 28:57.167
Michael.

29:13.653 --> 29:14.403
Irene.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.450
Irene. I knew that.

29:20.333 --> 29:22.210
I just wanted to say goodbye.

29:23.693 --> 29:25.888
No one ever said goodbye to me before.

29:32.373 --> 29:33.601
Well, goodbye, Irene.

29:34.053 --> 29:34.883
Goodbye.

29:35.093 --> 29:37.561
I wish it were night so I could say,
"Good night, Irene."

29:40.693 --> 29:41.967
That'll come later.

29:46.253 --> 29:47.447
Well, you gotta go.

29:48.213 --> 29:50.090
Come on, boys. Let's go.

30:02.453 --> 30:03.772
I love you.

30:04.653 --> 30:06.644
I will always love you, Christina.

31:42.453 --> 31:45.331
Pack it in there good.
We got more coming down.

31:45.893 --> 31:47.804
Did we get all them eggs up there?

31:58.893 --> 32:00.724
<i>We catching some fish</i>

32:02.093 --> 32:03.731
Is that gonna crap out again?

32:03.933 --> 32:05.127
Never!

32:41.213 --> 32:42.441
Do you mind?

32:46.093 --> 32:48.209
Stinks in here, doesn't it?

32:49.013 --> 32:50.605
Not anymore.

33:02.053 --> 33:05.170
<i>Hi, Bobby:</i>
<i>You're somewhere out there...</i>

33:05.613 --> 33:08.411
<i>... on the deep blue, goddamn sea...</i>

33:09.013 --> 33:12.608
<i>... and I'm writing this on a box</i>
<i>of two semi-down pillows...</i>

33:12.813 --> 33:15.407
<i>... that I secretly bought for us</i>
<i>at Penney's.</i>

33:16.293 --> 33:18.409
<i>And I'm smiling to myself because...</i>

33:18.653 --> 33:20.928
<i>... of the surprise I have</i>
<i>in store for you.</i>

33:21.653 --> 33:26.044
<i>I'm talking removal from our dungeon</i>
<i>in the Crow's Nest...</i>

33:26.893 --> 33:28.963
<i>... to our own place.</i>

33:30.613 --> 33:32.729
<i>It's no great shakes...</i>

33:32.933 --> 33:35.845
<i>... but you gotta begin</i>
<i>with a baby shake, right?</i>

33:38.253 --> 33:40.050
<i>Forever love, Bobby.</i>

33:40.573 --> 33:42.803
<i>I'm in this for the long run.</i>

33:47.413 --> 33:50.371
- I'm not intruding, am I?
- You're not intruding.

33:50.853 --> 33:52.366
You're a natural.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.644
You've got some old salt
in your blood.

33:54.853 --> 33:55.922
Thanks.

33:58.373 --> 34:00.887
You're a happy man out here,
aren't you?

34:01.093 --> 34:02.446
Today, maybe.

34:03.173 --> 34:04.606
When do you get unhappy?

34:04.933 --> 34:06.366
The day we go home.

34:06.813 --> 34:09.088
Home? I thought the sea
was your home.

34:11.853 --> 34:12.842
You got me there.

34:15.172 --> 34:17.562
But if you were gonna pin me down...

34:19.013 --> 34:22.130
...I guess Pensacola, Florida is home.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.085
My ex lives there. Jodi.

34:24.293 --> 34:25.806
And my kids.

34:27.973 --> 34:31.851
I wasn't very good at doing things
the way they're supposed to be done.

34:32.053 --> 34:33.202
Wife.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.367
Kids.

34:35.773 --> 34:37.650
A house with things in it.
All that stuff.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.726
So why are you so happy?

34:40.773 --> 34:42.650
You just got me on a good day.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.449
I'm doing what I was made to do.

34:46.172 --> 34:48.733
And I got a feeling I'll do it
even better this time.

34:50.652 --> 34:51.722
How about you?

34:53.572 --> 34:56.167
I got a woman I can't stand to be
more than two feet away from.

34:56.493 --> 34:58.131
Congratulations.

34:59.493 --> 35:02.610
Then again, I love to fish.

35:07.253 --> 35:09.005
Son, you've got a problem.

35:09.493 --> 35:10.721
I know.

35:25.933 --> 35:27.048
Here you are.

35:35.213 --> 35:38.842
What do you think? Blue skies,
scattered showers, same old, same old?

35:39.053 --> 35:40.964
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- Or better.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.447
Watch it.

35:45.493 --> 35:47.245
This doesn't look good.

35:53.293 --> 35:55.045
Looks pretty ugly here too.

35:56.053 --> 35:57.088
Pam.

35:58.493 --> 36:01.803
Tell Bernie I need two graphics:
Bermuda and Sable Island.

36:20.213 --> 36:21.487
Good.

36:22.693 --> 36:24.012
What's our course?

36:24.213 --> 36:27.250
I've been sailing 42 years.
Never plotted a course.

36:28.293 --> 36:30.329
I set the compass, I ride it...

36:30.573 --> 36:32.768
...we'll be in Bermuda in no time.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.402
Let's go fishing.

37:17.213 --> 37:19.044
All right, guys, let's hit it!

37:20.373 --> 37:24.571
1000 hooks in the water before dinner.
I want 40 miles out there.

37:31.653 --> 37:33.723
Three-mile buoy out!

37:33.933 --> 37:35.286
Yeah, baby.

37:43.773 --> 37:44.888
Set.

38:00.293 --> 38:01.965
Okay, Sully, put it out.

38:03.253 --> 38:04.925
Highflyer!

38:30.773 --> 38:32.172
Hey, A.P.

38:34.133 --> 38:35.327
May the force be with us.

38:35.573 --> 38:37.962
You want to play with lightsticks,
stick them up your ass.

38:38.173 --> 38:38.969
Easy, Murph.

38:39.173 --> 38:41.892
He's dead weight.
He's been screwing around all night.

38:42.093 --> 38:43.412
A juicer and a head.

38:43.653 --> 38:44.847
Cape Ann, bottom shelf.

38:45.053 --> 38:47.647
Yeah, well, your wife
didn't feel that way.

38:52.853 --> 38:54.605
Hey, knock it off!

38:54.813 --> 38:58.123
I'll head for land and the Newfies
will throw you both in jail!

38:58.333 --> 38:59.846
All right, cap.

39:00.573 --> 39:01.642
Give us some lights.

39:04.173 --> 39:05.492
Come on. Jesus.

39:05.693 --> 39:07.285
Shake, you guys.

39:07.813 --> 39:08.962
Shake!

39:19.613 --> 39:21.922
- Just let it go.
- Your day is coming.

39:22.133 --> 39:24.806
Whenever you're ready.
I'll be right up here.

39:25.053 --> 39:27.726
The job ain't hard enough
without this knucklehead.

39:54.133 --> 39:55.248
Let's go.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.405
We're gonna make some money.

40:04.133 --> 40:05.725
Let's go, boys!

40:07.773 --> 40:09.286
Let's go! Come on!

40:27.013 --> 40:28.128
Come on.

40:48.253 --> 40:49.845
Do it, skip, do it.

40:50.693 --> 40:51.887
Make a killing.

40:53.573 --> 40:54.767
One's on.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.042
Fish on.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.686
Have those gaffs ready.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.202
Don't lose him, Murph.
Don't lose him.

41:06.173 --> 41:07.652
Pull him in, Murph.

41:13.813 --> 41:16.122
All right, now, gaff him. Gaff him!

41:23.213 --> 41:24.726
One, two, three!

41:40.333 --> 41:41.402
Pull him in.

41:52.133 --> 41:53.851
Come on, a little bit more.

41:59.813 --> 42:01.485
So what do you think?

42:01.733 --> 42:03.052
Do you think he'll like it?

42:03.253 --> 42:04.891
He'll love it.

42:06.293 --> 42:08.124
Enough to live with me in it?

42:09.053 --> 42:12.170
By now, honey, you know him
much better than I do.

42:14.693 --> 42:16.012
We're gonna make a go of it.

42:19.973 --> 42:21.691
I got confidence in you.

42:23.253 --> 42:25.084
What, are you putting me on?

42:27.893 --> 42:29.690
He's my precious boy.

42:30.693 --> 42:32.445
And you're the woman for him.

42:34.973 --> 42:37.123
That's something I don't joke about.

42:40.813 --> 42:43.725
<i>The activity down near Bermuda</i>
<i>is deepening rapidly.</i>

42:43.933 --> 42:45.969
<i>Given the warm and volatile</i>
<i>Gulf Stream...</i>

42:46.173 --> 42:50.610
<i>... it won 't take much to turn</i>
<i>this tropical storm into a hurricane.</i>

42:50.813 --> 42:53.611
<i>This just in, video of Sable Island.</i>

43:39.453 --> 43:43.332
I put so much ground beef and sausage
in this, it weighed out at 20 pounds.

43:43.573 --> 43:45.291
More than most of our fish weigh.

43:45.493 --> 43:47.290
Skipper say anything about us
coming up short?

43:47.493 --> 43:48.972
He's too scared to say.

43:49.173 --> 43:51.129
Skipper don't get scared.

43:51.613 --> 43:52.762
Just disappointed.

43:53.853 --> 43:55.889
You know why this lasagna weighs
20 pounds?

43:56.853 --> 43:58.923
It tasted like you
threw in a shot put.

44:00.373 --> 44:02.841
I once worked a site
with a guy like you.

44:03.613 --> 44:05.444
The guy had a real bad accident.

44:07.253 --> 44:10.245
Can't even keep track of them
with so many accidents at sea.

44:11.613 --> 44:13.490
Tough to get an ambulance too.

44:17.693 --> 44:18.808
Keep it up.

44:21.933 --> 44:23.605
Highflyer!

44:28.133 --> 44:30.442
A.P., give me a hand.

44:31.933 --> 44:34.242
Hey, how about a little hand
over here?

44:34.453 --> 44:36.808
You do your job, I'll do mine.

44:38.653 --> 44:40.132
Come on, guys.

44:41.853 --> 44:43.206
Came out here for nothing.

44:43.413 --> 44:45.369
Keep moving, keep moving.

44:47.613 --> 44:50.446
Come on, Sully, let's get
some bait going here.

45:07.253 --> 45:08.606
It's big.

45:08.813 --> 45:10.212
- Something very big.
- Fish on!

45:10.413 --> 45:11.562
Come on, guys.

45:11.773 --> 45:12.842
Oh, yeah.

45:13.053 --> 45:14.850
Come on. Bring it up.

45:28.053 --> 45:29.042
Bring it up.

45:32.573 --> 45:33.608
Get the gaff!

45:36.493 --> 45:37.812
Get it out of here!

45:38.013 --> 45:40.573
Stick him.
Stick it in his head! Good!

45:47.613 --> 45:48.841
Get him off!

45:49.973 --> 45:51.645
- He's got my leg!
- Hang on!

45:55.413 --> 45:58.211
Kick your foot out! Kick it!
Kick your foot out.

45:58.413 --> 45:59.607
Get back!

46:03.893 --> 46:06.123
All right, come on, get it out!

46:06.333 --> 46:07.322
Get it out of here.

46:08.373 --> 46:10.603
- Pull him back!
- Over the side.

46:11.853 --> 46:13.206
You all right?

46:18.973 --> 46:20.884
You're short a boot, rookie!

46:22.453 --> 46:24.171
Beats a leg, don't it?

46:44.813 --> 46:48.488
Okay, we're getting a reading of winds
over 140 knots sustained.

46:48.733 --> 46:50.769
Looks like a category 5.

47:15.933 --> 47:19.448
"Billy Tyne is no fine wine

47:21.013 --> 47:23.481
He's lost his touch with our long line

47:23.893 --> 47:27.329
Steamed here and there and all about

47:28.333 --> 47:30.005
What's our tally?

47:30.453 --> 47:31.966
We've struck out"

47:37.653 --> 47:40.292
All right, okay.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

47:52.013 --> 47:54.447
Why aren't you downstairs
watching the movie?

47:55.693 --> 47:57.331
One of our three movies?

47:58.013 --> 47:59.605
I know them all by heart.

48:03.093 --> 48:04.446
Skip...

48:05.013 --> 48:07.573
...what are you gonna do
about those sets? They suck.

48:08.133 --> 48:09.805
We ain't doing nothing.

48:11.373 --> 48:12.931
The boys been talking?

48:13.573 --> 48:15.131
About how I lost it?

48:16.573 --> 48:20.043
Billy Tyne's lost it? Gets a little
slow, they'll draw and quarter you.

48:21.133 --> 48:23.169
I just didn't think
you'd go along with it.

48:23.693 --> 48:27.288
I come here because I need the money.
I'm trying for a new start.

48:27.493 --> 48:29.723
Last trip I thought you had
something to offer.

48:29.933 --> 48:32.003
But all in all,
you're just a little punk.

48:33.013 --> 48:36.608
- You promised me a shitload of fish!
- You'll get a shitload of fish.

48:36.813 --> 48:40.044
I've been in bad patches so many times
and came home with so much stock...

48:40.253 --> 48:42.972
...little boys like you had to
pack it on the pier.

48:43.173 --> 48:45.641
I always find the fish! Always!

48:45.853 --> 48:48.765
And I will this time!
So don't fuck with me!

48:50.853 --> 48:52.366
Aye, aye, skip.

49:07.253 --> 49:08.402
Put them closer!

49:09.013 --> 49:12.847
Murph, closer!
Give them a goddamn banquet.

49:13.053 --> 49:14.645
Aye, aye, cap.

49:15.373 --> 49:17.728
You heard him, boys.
Boss ain't happy.

49:17.933 --> 49:19.332
Double-time.

49:21.293 --> 49:22.248
Let's go, Bob.

49:25.933 --> 49:27.048
Sullivan!

49:27.733 --> 49:30.088
I gotta hit you with a fish again
to get you to work?

49:30.293 --> 49:31.612
Lightsticks, now!

49:31.813 --> 49:33.485
Shut up, asshole!

49:33.693 --> 49:35.923
You couldn't bait fish in a barrel!

49:37.093 --> 49:39.926
- Come on.
- See what I got to deal with?

49:40.133 --> 49:41.771
That's a landlubber.
What an idiot!

49:41.973 --> 49:44.885
Come on, Sully.
What are you, a fisherman or a farmer?

49:45.093 --> 49:46.606
Bugs, help him out.

49:46.813 --> 49:49.043
Hurry up, before the captain sees.

49:49.333 --> 49:52.370
Okay, sure, I'll help him out.
What a screwup!

49:52.613 --> 49:55.730
- You're useless, Sully!
- Lay off, Bugs. You never screw up?

49:55.933 --> 49:58.606
You're nothing but a pimple
on the ass of progress.

49:58.813 --> 50:00.769
I've been on a better slab than this.

50:00.973 --> 50:02.486
I've had it with this.

50:11.293 --> 50:13.011
Take it easy.
It was an accident.

50:18.213 --> 50:21.330
You got the easiest job on the boat,
and you manage to screw it up!

50:21.573 --> 50:24.451
Kiss my ass, you little runt.
And you...!

50:26.813 --> 50:27.723
Murph!

50:31.613 --> 50:33.729
Cap, man overboard!

50:42.293 --> 50:43.965
Take the wheel!

50:59.893 --> 51:01.406
Back her down slow.

51:46.173 --> 51:47.686
Come on, Murph.

51:49.933 --> 51:51.491
We've got Murph!

52:00.253 --> 52:01.481
Come on!

52:20.053 --> 52:21.964
You all right? You all right?

52:26.573 --> 52:27.722
Come on, Murph.

52:29.173 --> 52:30.208
Come on.

52:33.093 --> 52:34.208
Come on.

52:50.493 --> 52:52.211
How was the water, Murph?

52:52.413 --> 52:54.324
Welcome back, Murph!

52:57.653 --> 52:58.529
You did it, Murph.

53:05.253 --> 53:06.322
Hold on a minute.

53:12.293 --> 53:14.170
All right, bend over.

53:16.253 --> 53:17.208
Tetanus.

53:20.693 --> 53:22.445
Who's the hero?

53:22.933 --> 53:24.844
Bobby and Sully.

53:26.053 --> 53:27.247
Sully?

53:32.133 --> 53:35.045
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dale Murphy out of Cortez, Florida.

53:35.253 --> 53:38.609
The only fish the <i>Andrea Gail</i> has
hooked in three days.

53:38.813 --> 53:40.087
How you feeling?

53:40.293 --> 53:41.408
All right.

53:42.813 --> 53:45.281
- Bobby, thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

53:48.453 --> 53:50.648
Sully was the first one to go in.

53:55.773 --> 53:59.049
So I guess you're the big hero here.

53:59.813 --> 54:01.883
Well, you'd have done the same for me.

54:03.213 --> 54:04.805
Isn't that what I'm supposed to say?

54:07.413 --> 54:09.847
Well, you can say what you want...

54:10.693 --> 54:12.843
...but I'm glad you know how to swim.

54:13.493 --> 54:15.165
That's real big of you, Murph.

54:17.053 --> 54:18.452
It's all I can manage now.

54:19.893 --> 54:21.121
All right?

54:22.253 --> 54:23.652
I'll work on it.

54:29.013 --> 54:30.287
Tough guy.

54:40.373 --> 54:42.933
This weather fax just came in.

54:44.693 --> 54:46.763
Edie, have a look at this.

54:47.853 --> 54:51.368
We have got to head in now!
Put it in at Watch Hill!

54:51.613 --> 54:53.285
In this stuff, harbor's too dangerous.

54:53.493 --> 54:54.243
Dangerous?

54:54.453 --> 54:56.523
Dash into shore,
cut across shipping lanes...

54:56.733 --> 54:59.406
This is a hurricane
coming straight at us!

54:59.653 --> 55:02.565
Let me reduce sails, Sandy,
or even go back home.

55:02.773 --> 55:03.728
This is my boat.

55:03.933 --> 55:06.686
We'll ride this thing out.
Not for fun, for safety.

55:06.893 --> 55:09.851
Do what I've always done:
Go with the flow.

55:25.213 --> 55:27.602
Holy shit! Rogue wave!

55:28.973 --> 55:30.247
Look out!

55:44.573 --> 55:45.483
Everybody here?

55:57.013 --> 56:00.085
Captain, the boys would like
to have a word with you.

56:03.133 --> 56:04.407
Take over.

56:23.773 --> 56:26.207
When this meeting's over,
straighten this crap up.

56:26.973 --> 56:28.452
So what's the word?

56:30.573 --> 56:33.133
We're starting to get
an unlucky feeling out here.

56:33.333 --> 56:35.972
Murph going over, the shark,
a rogue <i>wave...</i>

56:36.173 --> 56:37.128
Yeah, what else?

56:38.733 --> 56:42.487
Never mind unlucky.
We're just looking for some fish.

56:42.893 --> 56:46.568
We had slumps before, you and I,
but nothing like this.

56:46.773 --> 56:50.083
You boys look like you got busted
in a brawl in Scollay Square.

56:50.293 --> 56:52.443
That's how we feel.
We want to go home.

56:53.893 --> 56:57.772
You want to go home? You Ionely for
that young mama who was all over you?

56:57.973 --> 56:59.929
My girl is none of your business.

57:00.133 --> 57:03.443
But you are. If you don't like it,
get the hell off! All of you.

57:06.693 --> 57:10.083
I look around and all I see are
little boys sitting on their asses...

57:10.293 --> 57:12.284
...too scared to go
and get some pay dirt.

57:12.493 --> 57:15.769
Pay dirt? What are you talking about?
Where the hell is that?

57:15.973 --> 57:17.326
We covered the Grand Banks.

57:17.653 --> 57:20.372
The Grand Banks are west of us.
I'm headed east.

57:21.853 --> 57:22.922
The Flemish Cap.

57:26.053 --> 57:27.645
The Flemish Cap?

57:28.173 --> 57:31.085
Why don't we steam to Portugal
while we're at it?

57:35.893 --> 57:38.123
So this is the moment of truth.

57:41.053 --> 57:43.283
This is where they separate
the men from the boys.

57:47.653 --> 57:48.847
How about it?

57:51.613 --> 57:53.331
- Are you Gloucestermen?
- Yeah.

57:53.573 --> 57:56.371
But why go all the way
to the Flemish Cap to prove it?

57:57.013 --> 57:58.492
Tell him, Alfred Pierre.

58:00.933 --> 58:02.446
That's where the fish are.

58:05.493 --> 58:07.051
Do we have any other choice?

58:07.733 --> 58:10.167
Yeah. Crawl home, busted.

58:18.053 --> 58:20.044
- All right, skip.
- All right.

58:21.333 --> 58:22.448
All right.

58:28.573 --> 58:32.327
<i>Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8- 1,</i>
<i>do you read me?</i>

58:32.573 --> 58:36.327
This is <i>Andrea Gail,</i> Whiskey-
Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8-1. Hey, Linda.

58:37.013 --> 58:39.732
<i>What's happening?</i>

58:39.933 --> 58:41.286
<i>Slim to none. Where are you?</i>

58:41.693 --> 58:44.969
Tail of the Banks.
Kicking up something wicked here.

58:45.173 --> 58:46.447
Made a couple of sets.

58:46.653 --> 58:47.642
You doing any good?

58:47.853 --> 58:52.165
Nine, first set. Twelve...
No, make that a baker's dozen, second.

58:52.373 --> 58:54.409
<i>Got a couple of markers to boot.</i>

58:54.653 --> 58:57.292
Your hand is so hot,
I can feel the heat from here.

58:57.853 --> 59:01.084
- I've asked you to team up.
<i>- I don 't like partners.</i>

59:01.293 --> 59:02.692
Business-wise, that is.

59:02.893 --> 59:05.566
Okay, okay. What's your position?

59:05.773 --> 59:08.048
46 north, 48 west.

59:08.493 --> 59:09.926
You headed for the Flemish Cap?

59:10.133 --> 59:13.648
<i>The lady knows her coordinates.</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm steaming full-bore.</i>

59:13.853 --> 59:15.730
The Flemish Cap is
nearly off the charts.

59:15.933 --> 59:17.491
What are you trying to prove?

59:17.733 --> 59:21.772
We got gale-force coming out
of Bermuda, stuff out of Sable Island.

59:21.973 --> 59:24.692
<i>As for me, I'm staring here</i>
<i>at solid white chop.</i>

59:24.893 --> 59:26.451
This could be a triple-header.

59:26.853 --> 59:28.889
You're behind me.
So is your weather.

59:29.493 --> 59:32.565
Yeah, but you've gotta go
through it to get back.

59:33.293 --> 59:34.726
Good point.

59:34.933 --> 59:37.731
Billy, you won't like this,
but I'm gonna say it anyway:

59:38.013 --> 59:39.332
You be careful.

59:39.573 --> 59:40.892
Yes, Mother.

59:43.213 --> 59:45.488
Why don't we pick this up later?
I'm out.

01:00:04.813 --> 01:00:07.168
- You guys use some company?
- Sure.

01:00:07.573 --> 01:00:09.370
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:00:10.973 --> 01:00:14.090
<i>- in the mid-Atlantic,</i>
<i>moving rapidly northeast...</i>

01:00:14.293 --> 01:00:15.851
<i>... 30-foot waves.</i>

01:00:16.053 --> 01:00:17.042
What'd you hear?

01:00:17.253 --> 01:00:19.244
They're out on the Flemish Cap.

01:00:19.453 --> 01:00:21.842
I got it straight from big Bob Brown.

01:00:23.373 --> 01:00:24.488
Yeah.

01:00:25.053 --> 01:00:26.645
The Flemish Cap.

01:00:27.653 --> 01:00:29.723
I went there, '62.

01:00:30.933 --> 01:00:32.446
Lots of fish.

01:00:33.613 --> 01:00:35.251
And lots of weather.

01:00:35.773 --> 01:00:36.888
Hurricanes...

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.169
...squalls, huge seas.

01:00:39.373 --> 01:00:40.965
You're full of shit, Quentin.

01:00:42.653 --> 01:00:43.722
That's right.

01:00:44.733 --> 01:00:45.802
I am.

01:02:14.933 --> 01:02:18.209
- Where are you going?
- To point this boat up into the storm.

01:02:18.413 --> 01:02:20.165
And scream for help!

01:02:20.373 --> 01:02:24.048
We lie ahull, beam to the waves,
slip sideways. Standard procedure.

01:02:24.293 --> 01:02:27.888
Forget it, we won't make it!
Missy, get on the radio now!

01:02:28.093 --> 01:02:29.606
- We can make it.
- Mayday!

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:32.373
It's sopping wet!
She'll be weeping in the wind. No!

01:02:32.813 --> 01:02:34.963
We stay below and ride this thing out.

01:02:35.173 --> 01:02:37.050
Remember, this is my boat!

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:39.209
This is my life!

01:02:39.413 --> 01:02:40.209
Go, Melissa!

01:02:45.013 --> 01:02:46.048
Mayday!

01:02:46.253 --> 01:02:47.891
Mayday! Mayday!

01:02:51.653 --> 01:02:54.770
We're a 32-foot
sailing vessel, <i>Mistral.</i>

01:02:55.253 --> 01:02:57.050
Our position is...

01:02:58.653 --> 01:03:00.052
...39.49 north...

01:03:02.053 --> 01:03:04.009
Mayday! Mayday!

01:03:06.093 --> 01:03:07.208
Over.

01:03:35.653 --> 01:03:36.608
Hey, cap!

01:03:44.093 --> 01:03:45.845
Ice machine's had it.
It's dead.

01:03:48.293 --> 01:03:49.885
- Check the evaporator?
- Yeah.

01:03:50.853 --> 01:03:52.286
- Freon?
- Plenty, but nowhere to flow.

01:03:52.773 --> 01:03:53.967
Use some spit and glue.

01:03:54.213 --> 01:03:56.522
I did. She's fried, skip.

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:58.291
I told Brown, get us a new one...

01:03:58.493 --> 01:04:00.768
...but he gets another overhaul,
son of a bitch!

01:04:05.613 --> 01:04:06.682
Sorry.

01:04:14.453 --> 01:04:16.091
The ice machine's gone.

01:04:18.013 --> 01:04:19.332
Oh, fuck.

01:04:26.813 --> 01:04:28.883
All right,
we got good ice on them now.

01:04:29.173 --> 01:04:30.765
We seal the fish hold.

01:04:30.973 --> 01:04:33.726
With luck, we'll deliver
the catch and set the market.

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:36.687
Pull up the gear.

01:04:38.773 --> 01:04:40.047
We're going home.

01:04:43.093 --> 01:04:45.766
Put these babies on ice,
and we're out of here!

01:05:04.573 --> 01:05:08.088
<i>We are taking heavy waves.</i>
<i>Damage on deck.</i>

01:05:10.653 --> 01:05:12.689
<i>Need immediate assistance.</i>

01:05:12.893 --> 01:05:16.044
<i>We're beam to the sea</i>
<i>and taking on water.</i>

01:05:16.253 --> 01:05:18.813
Just so you understand
what we're up against.

01:05:19.733 --> 01:05:24.011
We're looking at 40 to 50-foot waves,
gale-force winds. A real bad one.

01:05:24.213 --> 01:05:25.646
Right in our path.

01:05:26.333 --> 01:05:28.688
The Weather Service
is jerking off again.

01:05:28.893 --> 01:05:29.848
No.

01:05:30.973 --> 01:05:32.452
You're afraid?

01:05:32.813 --> 01:05:34.610
I never seen you scared.

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:37.893
It's pretty rough stuff out there,
that's for sure.

01:05:38.933 --> 01:05:41.811
We either hang out here
for a few days till it calms down...

01:05:42.013 --> 01:05:43.128
But, cap...

01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:45.847
...we got 60,000 pounds of fish here.

01:05:46.053 --> 01:05:47.725
Are we gonna let it spoil?

01:05:47.933 --> 01:05:50.845
I thought we were gonna
set the market, make a killing.

01:05:51.053 --> 01:05:53.692
Or we say the hell with it.

01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:56.164
We drive right through it.

01:06:03.933 --> 01:06:05.844
You said we're Gloucestermen.

01:06:11.653 --> 01:06:13.132
What do you say, guys?

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:14.971
Are we or aren't we?

01:06:16.093 --> 01:06:17.412
Did we come out here for nothing?

01:06:17.653 --> 01:06:19.848
- It's a lot of money.
- Let's make some money.

01:06:20.053 --> 01:06:22.931
Come on. Let's hear it, Gloucester!

01:06:23.973 --> 01:06:27.568
Let's get her lashed down.
Bugs, put the birds in the water.

01:06:27.773 --> 01:06:29.650
Birds in. Got it, skip.

01:06:37.933 --> 01:06:39.605
Look. Look at this.

01:06:40.613 --> 01:06:43.889
We got Hurricane Grace moving north
off the Atlantic seaboard.

01:06:44.413 --> 01:06:45.641
Huge...

01:06:45.853 --> 01:06:47.809
...getting massive.

01:06:48.013 --> 01:06:51.722
Two, this low south of Sable Island,
ready to explode.

01:06:52.653 --> 01:06:53.802
Look at this.

01:06:54.293 --> 01:06:58.605
Three, a fresh cold front
swooping down from Canada.

01:06:59.253 --> 01:07:01.323
But it's caught a ride
on the jet stream...

01:07:01.573 --> 01:07:04.212
...and is motoring hell-bent
towards the Atlantic.

01:07:04.853 --> 01:07:05.808
Cool.

01:07:06.093 --> 01:07:07.082
Wait, wait.

01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:10.722
What if Hurricane Grace
runs smack into it?

01:07:11.253 --> 01:07:15.326
Add to the scenario this baby off
Sable Island, scrounging for energy.

01:07:15.613 --> 01:07:19.049
She'll start feeding off
both the Canadian cold front...

01:07:19.413 --> 01:07:21.324
...and Hurricane Grace.

01:07:21.973 --> 01:07:23.964
You could be a meteorologist
all your life...

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.322
...and never see something like this.

01:07:27.248 --> 01:07:30.399
It would be a disaster
of epic proportions.

01:07:31.488 --> 01:07:32.807
<i>It would be...</i>

01:07:33.008 --> 01:07:34.805
<i>... the perfect storm.</i>

01:07:45.848 --> 01:07:46.917
Let's get down below.

01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:49.163
Bobby?

01:07:49.968 --> 01:07:51.481
I want you up here with me.

01:08:06.368 --> 01:08:08.882
Mayday! Mayday!

01:08:13.248 --> 01:08:16.843
<i>Sailing vessel</i> Mistral,
<i>this is Coast Guard rescue.</i>

01:08:17.048 --> 01:08:18.197
Sandy!

01:08:20.848 --> 01:08:23.885
Edie, they heard me!
They're coming!

01:08:34.448 --> 01:08:36.359
<i>Air Force rescue 2-3- 1.</i>

01:08:36.568 --> 01:08:38.319
We've located the <i>Mistral.</i>

01:08:38.568 --> 01:08:40.798
<i>Position: 39.49 north...</i>

01:08:41.008 --> 01:08:43.044
<i>... 69. 52 west.</i>

01:08:45.568 --> 01:08:47.046
How far's that last position?

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:49.078
About 20.3 miles, captain.

01:08:49.287 --> 01:08:51.118
OD, boatswain on the bridge.

01:08:56.087 --> 01:08:57.600
Tallyho, there they are.

01:09:02.928 --> 01:09:05.680
- Okay, guys, showtime.
- You got it.

01:09:06.127 --> 01:09:07.880
<i>Mistral,</i> this is 2-3-1.

01:09:08.087 --> 01:09:11.238
We're gonna extract you
one at a time from the deck.

01:09:11.568 --> 01:09:13.718
Hey, Jeremy, I don't like this.

01:09:14.087 --> 01:09:17.285
- Clock's ticking.
- Come on, we better get them off now.

01:09:17.488 --> 01:09:18.477
Get closer, Darryl.

01:09:18.808 --> 01:09:20.036
Just a little closer.

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:26.919
Okay, deploying the basket.

01:09:27.888 --> 01:09:29.367
Close to 2:00.

01:09:29.608 --> 01:09:30.801
Let's come right to 5.

01:09:31.408 --> 01:09:33.444
- Four. Three.
- Son of a bitch.

01:09:33.648 --> 01:09:35.479
Stop there. Hold your hover.

01:09:35.728 --> 01:09:36.843
Goddamn it!

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.323
Keep it steady, keep it steady.

01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:42.157
Shit!

01:09:48.488 --> 01:09:49.886
Man out!

01:09:50.448 --> 01:09:52.598
- Shear the cable!
- No, I got it!

01:10:09.448 --> 01:10:10.403
Shit.

01:10:10.648 --> 01:10:12.081
Bring up the basket!

01:10:15.608 --> 01:10:16.836
Sandy!

01:10:17.688 --> 01:10:18.882
Hold on!

01:10:19.088 --> 01:10:20.316
I got you!

01:10:20.648 --> 01:10:23.003
- Basket's in.
- Looks like I'm going for a swim.

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:24.323
Okay, go get them.

01:10:24.568 --> 01:10:26.126
Mitchell off intercom.

01:10:27.088 --> 01:10:28.487
It's time to get wet.

01:10:30.688 --> 01:10:32.724
We're gonna be all right.

01:10:34.248 --> 01:10:35.203
Go.

01:11:09.368 --> 01:11:10.323
Altitude.

01:11:11.448 --> 01:11:13.484
Altitude. Get her up, get her up!

01:11:18.968 --> 01:11:20.083
He's in the water.

01:11:23.848 --> 01:11:25.406
I'm going after him!

01:11:25.608 --> 01:11:26.961
No, no, wait! Stand by!

01:11:29.168 --> 01:11:30.647
Jonesy, hold on.

01:11:39.208 --> 01:11:40.402
There! He's okay.

01:11:40.928 --> 01:11:43.567
This isn't working.
They'll have to get in the water.

01:11:54.408 --> 01:11:56.399
Come on, come on!

01:11:57.248 --> 01:11:58.727
You're having a blast, huh?

01:11:58.928 --> 01:12:02.045
- Want a turn?
- No, just watch. I want to watch.

01:12:02.248 --> 01:12:04.921
I'm studying up for the day
I get my own boat.

01:12:05.208 --> 01:12:06.880
Your own boat, huh?

01:12:07.088 --> 01:12:09.397
Want to give me a hand?
Grab the throttle.

01:12:12.048 --> 01:12:13.367
Hang on.

01:12:16.328 --> 01:12:18.080
- Ah, shit!
- Seven K, six easy.

01:12:18.288 --> 01:12:19.846
- Eight minimum.
- Ten.

01:12:20.288 --> 01:12:23.439
You know, I'm gonna get me
a new used Ford F-150...

01:12:23.688 --> 01:12:25.599
...take a ride to Digby with Irene.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:29.801
Going to get drunk, eat like a pig
and sleep like a child!

01:12:30.008 --> 01:12:31.407
Fish and fun-gee!

01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:38.840
Okay, Jer, too risky to go lower.
You gotta jump from here.

01:12:54.448 --> 01:12:57.804
Good afternoon, madam.
I'm Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell.

01:12:58.008 --> 01:13:00.283
I'll be your para-rescue jumper today.

01:13:00.608 --> 01:13:02.007
How are you?

01:13:02.248 --> 01:13:03.761
Okay so far.

01:13:18.968 --> 01:13:21.926
Keep your hands
and feet in the basket.

01:13:25.848 --> 01:13:27.076
- Careful.
- Okay!

01:13:27.288 --> 01:13:28.880
All right, here we go.

01:13:35.888 --> 01:13:36.798
You're next.

01:13:48.008 --> 01:13:49.646
That was nothing!

01:13:50.088 --> 01:13:51.077
Come on!

01:14:04.928 --> 01:14:06.361
Oh, my God.

01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:08.721
It's happening.

01:14:44.888 --> 01:14:47.925
<i>Andrea Gail, Andrea Gail.</i>
This is <i>Hannah Boden.</i>

01:14:52.328 --> 01:14:53.477
- Billy, over.

01:14:55.128 --> 01:14:56.243
Calling the <i>Andrea Gail.</i>

01:15:02.448 --> 01:15:04.757
<i>Andrea Gail,</i> do you read me?

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:07.038
Do you read me? Come in!

01:15:07.248 --> 01:15:11.207
Come in, for God's sake, come in!
Billy, these storms have collided!

01:15:11.408 --> 01:15:12.761
They are exploding!

01:15:15.128 --> 01:15:16.356
Who is it?

01:15:17.008 --> 01:15:17.804
I don't know.

01:15:18.008 --> 01:15:19.760
<i>Andrea Gail,</i> come in!

01:15:20.968 --> 01:15:23.926
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over.

01:15:24.128 --> 01:15:25.561
Talk to me, Billy, over.

01:15:25.768 --> 01:15:28.077
I repeat,
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1...

01:15:30.128 --> 01:15:32.437
Look at your fax, damn it!
Look at your fax!

01:15:32.648 --> 01:15:35.606
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over!

01:15:35.808 --> 01:15:38.117
<i>- Where are you, Billy?</i>
- Linda?

01:15:38.328 --> 01:15:39.477
Give me the coordinates.

01:15:39.688 --> 01:15:42.725
- 44 north, 56.4 west.
- We're 44 north...

01:15:42.928 --> 01:15:45.567
<i>... 56.4 west, headed west.</i>

01:15:46.008 --> 01:15:50.763
<i>I repeat, 44 north,</i>
<i>56.4 west, headed...</i>

01:15:51.608 --> 01:15:53.121
<i>Over.</i>

01:15:53.328 --> 01:15:55.717
Billy, get out of there.

01:15:56.248 --> 01:15:59.479
Come about! Let it carry you out!
What the hell are you doing?

01:15:59.728 --> 01:16:00.763
Hang on!

01:16:02.408 --> 01:16:05.605
Billy! Billy, for chrissake!

01:16:05.808 --> 01:16:09.198
You're steaming into a bomb!
Turn around, for chrissake!

01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:12.603
It's the antenna.

01:16:12.808 --> 01:16:14.924
Billy, can you hear me?

01:16:15.248 --> 01:16:18.684
You're headed right
for the middle of the monster.

01:16:27.888 --> 01:16:29.640
Oh, my God.

01:16:38.248 --> 01:16:39.237
Hang on!

01:16:40.928 --> 01:16:42.077
Take the wheel.

01:16:42.568 --> 01:16:43.887
No, I'll go.

01:16:45.848 --> 01:16:47.645
Mayday, mayday, mayday...

01:16:47.848 --> 01:16:49.486
...Coast Guard Boston.

01:16:50.288 --> 01:16:53.280
This is fishing vessel <i>Hannah Boden</i>
relaying a mayday...

01:16:53.488 --> 01:16:55.638
...for swordboat <i>Andrea Gail.</i>

01:16:55.888 --> 01:16:58.800
Last position, 44 north...

01:16:59.168 --> 01:17:02.444
...56.4 west, over.

01:17:03.408 --> 01:17:07.560
<i>Advise you proceed to next incident</i>
<i>at your discretion, over.</i>

01:17:07.768 --> 01:17:09.486
Yeah, roger, Boston.

01:17:09.688 --> 01:17:12.441
I just got a mayday on a Gloucester
swordboat, the <i>Andrea Gail.</i>

01:17:12.688 --> 01:17:16.920
44 north, 56.4 west, headed west.

01:17:17.328 --> 01:17:19.762
Jesus. That's straight into hell.

01:17:20.008 --> 01:17:22.727
Gloucester.
They're always from Gloucester.

01:17:22.928 --> 01:17:26.557
It's an increased-risk mission,
so, you know, it's up to us.

01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:28.838
I'm getting
a little air-to-air feeling.

01:17:29.048 --> 01:17:30.925
Refuel in hell?
That's pretty sporty.

01:17:31.248 --> 01:17:33.159
Call the cutter.
We're coming in hot.

01:17:33.568 --> 01:17:36.287
People, slight change of plans!

01:17:36.728 --> 01:17:39.561
We're gonna drop you on
the Coast Guard cutter <i>Tamaroa.</i>

01:17:39.768 --> 01:17:42.760
We got some swordfishermen
who have lost their way.

01:17:44.208 --> 01:17:45.721
Or their minds.

01:18:24.368 --> 01:18:27.280
<i>This is rescue 2-3- 1
<i>on final approach.</i></i>

01:18:27.488 --> 01:18:31.117
<i>Rescue 2-3- 1, flight deck is green.</i>

01:18:31.728 --> 01:18:34.037
There it is.
You're being waved in.

01:18:34.248 --> 01:18:35.806
Thirty meters and closing.

01:18:36.008 --> 01:18:38.283
Twenty-five meters, winds 43.

01:18:38.488 --> 01:18:40.683
Set a line at 0-1-0.

01:18:41.128 --> 01:18:43.403
Beautiful. We're coming.

01:18:43.608 --> 01:18:44.757
Watch this wave, cap.

01:18:44.968 --> 01:18:46.924
<i>2- 3- 1, looking good.</i>
<i>Transfer at will.</i>

01:18:47.128 --> 01:18:48.163
Drop ladder.

01:18:51.248 --> 01:18:52.840
All right, send them down.

01:18:53.048 --> 01:18:54.163
Put your foot out.

01:18:54.848 --> 01:18:55.678
Left leg out.

01:18:55.888 --> 01:18:57.685
Mind your helm, goddamn it.

01:19:00.088 --> 01:19:01.441
Watch the deck!

01:19:02.568 --> 01:19:03.762
Come on.

01:19:04.608 --> 01:19:06.246
First survivor on deck.

01:19:06.448 --> 01:19:09.838
- Where's our fuel?
- Refueling tanker is on the way.

01:19:10.888 --> 01:19:12.765
<i>Second survivor on deck.</i>

01:19:13.008 --> 01:19:14.123
Jesus.

01:20:12.088 --> 01:20:13.043
It's gone.

01:20:15.408 --> 01:20:18.923
No antenna, no radio.
We're back in the 19th century.

01:20:22.848 --> 01:20:24.645
You want to call it quits,
turn around?

01:20:25.848 --> 01:20:26.837
What do you think?

01:20:28.728 --> 01:20:30.081
I think she's a hell of a boat.

01:20:30.648 --> 01:20:31.876
With a hell of a crew.

01:20:32.168 --> 01:20:33.442
And a hell of a skipper.

01:20:38.048 --> 01:20:39.925
All right then, Gloucester...

01:20:40.128 --> 01:20:41.481
...we're coming home!

01:21:00.888 --> 01:21:02.082
Take the wheel!

01:21:02.688 --> 01:21:03.598
Skipper, don't!

01:21:03.808 --> 01:21:06.686
Take the goddamn wheel!
That's an order!

01:21:17.008 --> 01:21:18.805
Damn, I can't see anything.

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:26.879
What's the gauge say?

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:30.681
It's low, Jonesy.
Where are they?

01:21:30.888 --> 01:21:33.686
- Tanker's on the way.
- How many stops are they making?

01:21:36.408 --> 01:21:37.363
No!

01:21:39.248 --> 01:21:41.318
Come on! Not again.

01:21:41.888 --> 01:21:44.038
Hello? Ethel, thank God!

01:21:44.248 --> 01:21:47.718
I'm going crazy here.
Even the weather guy's gone bananas.

01:21:47.928 --> 01:21:50.806
Have you heard from...?
Hello? Ethel?

01:21:51.928 --> 01:21:52.963
Shit!

01:22:15.328 --> 01:22:17.364
There she is! Thank God.

01:22:17.608 --> 01:22:20.566
Let's fill her up, save these yahoos
and get out of here.

01:22:20.888 --> 01:22:22.879
King 1-2, we have visual.

01:22:23.128 --> 01:22:26.837
Air Force rescue 2-3-1,
you've got a wet hose.

01:23:17.168 --> 01:23:19.602
All right now, hold on!

01:23:35.568 --> 01:23:37.047
In the water!

01:23:37.728 --> 01:23:39.161
Hold on, skip!

01:24:25.808 --> 01:24:27.082
Shit.

01:24:51.288 --> 01:24:52.277
Come on, skip!

01:24:55.928 --> 01:24:58.203
Come on, skip, come on!

01:25:25.088 --> 01:25:25.964
Yeah!

01:25:33.648 --> 01:25:34.967
Anything yet?

01:25:35.168 --> 01:25:36.203
Nothing about boats.

01:25:36.408 --> 01:25:38.763
- I got four nines.
- He's a liar.

01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:40.117
Florence.

01:25:42.368 --> 01:25:44.598
<i>Damage estimates</i>
<i>are in the high millions.</i>

01:25:44.808 --> 01:25:46.400
<i>Folks, the worst is yet to come.</i>

01:25:46.648 --> 01:25:48.320
<i>The storm of the century.</i>

01:25:48.568 --> 01:25:51.480
<i>Residents, stay inside,</i>
<i>pack sandbags against door frames.</i>

01:25:51.728 --> 01:25:55.164
<i>A report here that Cape Ann</i>
<i>fishing industry is in tatters.</i>

01:25:55.368 --> 01:25:58.360
<i>Lobstermen from Gloucester to Scituate</i>
<i>have lost their traps.</i>

01:25:58.648 --> 01:26:02.766
<i>A missing swordboat,</i> Andrea Gail,
<i>out of Gloucester with a crew of six.</i>

01:26:02.968 --> 01:26:06.085
<i>An Air National Guard rescue</i>
<i>helicopter has been dispatched.</i>

01:26:06.288 --> 01:26:09.598
<i>At Logan International Airport,</i>
<i>flooded runways.</i>

01:26:17.768 --> 01:26:18.996
We did it!

01:26:27.688 --> 01:26:30.043
- Get those windows boarded up!
- All right, skip.

01:26:30.248 --> 01:26:31.920
Come on, board it up!

01:26:36.768 --> 01:26:39.726
Tell those guys forget it.
We'll get our gas somewhere else.

01:26:52.088 --> 01:26:53.123
What do you think?

01:27:00.368 --> 01:27:01.926
We're running on fumes.

01:27:04.328 --> 01:27:06.000
King 1-2, this isn't gonna work.

01:27:07.248 --> 01:27:08.920
<i>This is not our night.</i>

01:27:11.128 --> 01:27:15.087
We're issuing a mayday.
Give the Coast Guard our coordinates.

01:27:16.728 --> 01:27:18.127
We're ditching.

01:27:21.648 --> 01:27:25.436
Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1
calling Coast Guard <i>Tamaroa.</i>

01:27:25.648 --> 01:27:29.482
Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1
calling Coast Guard <i>Tamaroa.</i>

01:27:30.288 --> 01:27:32.756
King 1-2, departing the area.

01:27:36.808 --> 01:27:37.797
Come on!

01:27:38.128 --> 01:27:39.607
Let's get it up!

01:27:45.168 --> 01:27:46.965
All right, guys, get ready!

01:27:48.488 --> 01:27:49.716
Hold on!

01:27:49.968 --> 01:27:51.447
Get it up there!

01:27:54.768 --> 01:27:55.837
Get another one.

01:27:56.048 --> 01:27:57.117
Come on.

01:28:05.328 --> 01:28:08.206
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Grab them, grab them!

01:28:10.488 --> 01:28:12.365
Hang on, there's a swell!

01:28:21.928 --> 01:28:24.044
Come on, guys, try to get you close.

01:28:24.248 --> 01:28:26.284
- Stay together.
- Roger that.

01:28:31.648 --> 01:28:32.683
Number 1 is out!

01:28:34.288 --> 01:28:35.607
Bail! Bail out!

01:28:35.968 --> 01:28:38.926
- Leave yourself enough time, okay?
- I'll be fine.

01:28:49.648 --> 01:28:50.797
Go, Jonesy, go!

01:28:54.928 --> 01:28:56.407
You're next.

01:28:59.768 --> 01:29:01.167
Hold on, hold on!

01:29:12.408 --> 01:29:14.046
Now, Jeremy, now!
Go! Bail out!

01:29:14.368 --> 01:29:15.847
See you, Darryl.

01:29:27.808 --> 01:29:30.117
No, no, no, no. No!

01:30:40.728 --> 01:30:42.081
Over here!

01:30:42.288 --> 01:30:45.166
We're over here!

01:30:57.848 --> 01:30:59.247
Have you seen Mitchell?

01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:01.118
No.

01:31:01.328 --> 01:31:02.556
What about Jonesy?

01:31:03.728 --> 01:31:04.956
Nothing. Just you.

01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:08.198
Goddamn it, we don't lose anybody!

01:31:14.328 --> 01:31:15.966
Come on, lay it on.

01:31:16.688 --> 01:31:18.360
- Get it locked!
- Get them on!

01:31:27.168 --> 01:31:28.806
They're not gonna make it!

01:31:29.008 --> 01:31:30.885
Tell them to hold on.
I'll turn the boat.

01:31:36.168 --> 01:31:37.442
Right now, let's go!

01:31:42.728 --> 01:31:44.559
Come on, guys, you can do it!

01:31:44.768 --> 01:31:46.759
It's jammed! It's jammed!

01:31:50.608 --> 01:31:52.007
Lock it down!

01:32:01.008 --> 01:32:02.236
I can't hold her!

01:32:09.088 --> 01:32:10.316
Come on, get it up.

01:32:10.808 --> 01:32:11.923
Put it on now!

01:32:12.128 --> 01:32:13.481
Come on, this is it.

01:32:14.808 --> 01:32:16.719
- Get it on.
- I'm trying!

01:32:16.928 --> 01:32:17.758
Get it on.

01:32:23.768 --> 01:32:25.167
It's loose. I got it!

01:32:32.208 --> 01:32:33.118
Man overboard!

01:32:33.808 --> 01:32:35.685
- What?!
- Two over the side.

01:32:40.408 --> 01:32:42.239
Come on, help me!

01:32:42.448 --> 01:32:43.563
Hold on, I got you!

01:32:46.448 --> 01:32:47.881
Grab the line!

01:32:59.848 --> 01:33:01.122
Oh, God.

01:33:01.728 --> 01:33:03.559
We lost Bugsy!

01:33:12.968 --> 01:33:13.878
Bugsy!

01:33:34.488 --> 01:33:36.160
Hold on. Grab this.

01:33:45.048 --> 01:33:46.322
Hold on!

01:33:49.608 --> 01:33:51.997
Come on, Bugsy. Grab it!

01:33:58.488 --> 01:33:59.443
Grab it!

01:34:01.288 --> 01:34:02.243
Bugsy!

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:35.881
There! Right there!

01:34:36.088 --> 01:34:37.999
Come on, let's go!

01:34:52.728 --> 01:34:55.481
I'm here, Jeremy, I'm here.
I got you. We're here.

01:34:56.448 --> 01:34:58.678
Hey, talk to me, J. Talk to me.

01:34:58.888 --> 01:35:01.322
I'm all busted up, cap.

01:35:01.688 --> 01:35:03.201
Can't breathe.

01:35:03.408 --> 01:35:06.923
- Hey, Mitch, have you seen Jonesy?
- No.

01:35:07.128 --> 01:35:09.961
Go find him. Go find Jonesy.
Go get him.

01:35:48.808 --> 01:35:50.366
Boys, that's it.

01:35:51.848 --> 01:35:53.076
We can't make it.

01:35:59.208 --> 01:36:00.721
We're turning around.

01:36:05.288 --> 01:36:07.119
Come on, cap, we can do it.

01:36:07.768 --> 01:36:09.167
What about our catch?

01:36:09.848 --> 01:36:11.327
We'll mug them next time.

01:36:13.608 --> 01:36:15.200
This piece of water belongs to us.

01:36:16.568 --> 01:36:19.128
The fish will gather again
for the <i>Andrea Gail...</i>

01:36:22.928 --> 01:36:23.838
...when we come back.

01:36:25.848 --> 01:36:28.123
This is gonna be
the turnaround of all time.

01:36:29.568 --> 01:36:30.842
Textbook.

01:36:31.928 --> 01:36:33.486
So get ready.

01:37:04.848 --> 01:37:07.362
If it were good news,
he would've called us.

01:37:08.808 --> 01:37:12.403
The news is the rescue helicopter
had to ditch.

01:37:12.648 --> 01:37:14.923
We can't raise the <i>Andrea Gail.</i>

01:37:17.008 --> 01:37:18.123
What does that mean?

01:37:18.808 --> 01:37:20.400
We don't know anything.

01:37:20.928 --> 01:37:24.557
If anyone can survive this storm,
it's Billy Tyne. I'll give him that.

01:37:24.768 --> 01:37:26.167
What do you want?

01:37:26.728 --> 01:37:29.481
Credit for having the guts
to walk in here?

01:37:29.728 --> 01:37:30.604
I do.

01:37:31.288 --> 01:37:32.880
Give it to him.

01:37:33.688 --> 01:37:34.677
How you doing, Quentin?

01:37:35.408 --> 01:37:37.000
Pretty good, governor.

01:37:37.808 --> 01:37:39.764
You're counting your money.

01:37:39.968 --> 01:37:44.405
And my guy is out there risking
his life for a bunch of stupid fish.

01:37:44.968 --> 01:37:45.923
That's the game.

01:37:47.088 --> 01:37:50.876
I hate the game.
I hate the goddamn game!

01:37:51.088 --> 01:37:52.077
Do you hear me?!

01:37:52.288 --> 01:37:55.121
Do you read me, governor?
Do you?!

01:37:55.328 --> 01:37:56.966
Do you read me?!

01:38:04.768 --> 01:38:06.360
Did you see him?

01:38:06.608 --> 01:38:08.200
I don't see anything!

01:38:12.448 --> 01:38:15.008
Look! There's the cutter.

01:38:22.928 --> 01:38:25.886
- Have them put out the cargo net.
- Cargo net, aye, sir.

01:38:27.168 --> 01:38:28.726
Put me alongside them.

01:38:29.448 --> 01:38:32.884
I want five men on that net.
And get the light out there.

01:38:33.088 --> 01:38:34.680
Okay, guys, hook in!

01:38:37.168 --> 01:38:38.487
Pick it up! Move!

01:38:38.728 --> 01:38:40.480
Keep your light on those swimmers!

01:38:40.728 --> 01:38:41.843
Get ready!

01:38:42.968 --> 01:38:45.118
Release the net now!

01:38:46.088 --> 01:38:48.397
Okay, now, Jeremy, swim!

01:38:49.008 --> 01:38:50.680
Swim!

01:39:01.648 --> 01:39:03.047
Give him a hand!

01:39:03.248 --> 01:39:05.398
Get ready!

01:39:05.648 --> 01:39:07.001
Come on!

01:39:37.848 --> 01:39:40.681
All right! Let's do it again.

01:39:40.888 --> 01:39:43.118
If they can't get to us,
we'll get to them.

01:39:43.328 --> 01:39:45.398
Go up swell and drift down.

01:39:45.648 --> 01:39:47.047
Broadside, captain?

01:39:47.248 --> 01:39:49.557
Isn't it too dangerous?
It's too hairy.

01:39:49.768 --> 01:39:51.281
I won't let two men drown!

01:39:54.408 --> 01:39:56.842
Hold on, Jer. Just hold on.

01:40:08.448 --> 01:40:10.803
When I say now, you go full throttle.
Got it?

01:40:14.688 --> 01:40:16.599
We only get one chance at this.

01:40:18.048 --> 01:40:18.958
And then?

01:40:20.808 --> 01:40:21.877
We pray.

01:40:38.888 --> 01:40:39.957
Wait.

01:40:41.448 --> 01:40:42.403
Wait.

01:40:51.968 --> 01:40:53.117
Wait.

01:40:54.808 --> 01:40:55.763
Wait.

01:41:06.728 --> 01:41:07.956
Now!

01:41:17.168 --> 01:41:18.647
Faster!

01:42:31.888 --> 01:42:33.287
We did it!

01:42:34.848 --> 01:42:35.917
Guys, we're alive!

01:42:36.448 --> 01:42:38.837
We made the turn! We did it!

01:42:43.048 --> 01:42:45.608
Hey, skip, I'm giving you notice.

01:42:45.808 --> 01:42:46.923
This is my last trip.

01:42:47.128 --> 01:42:50.564
When we get back, I'm going right to
Salisbury Beach with Chris.

01:42:50.768 --> 01:42:53.407
We're riding those go-carts,
full-time.

01:42:56.728 --> 01:42:58.241
What do you think, skip?

01:42:58.688 --> 01:43:00.565
We're doing 12 knots.

01:43:00.888 --> 01:43:04.119
We keep this up,
make it through till dawn...

01:43:04.928 --> 01:43:06.486
...we might get out of here.

01:43:14.088 --> 01:43:15.601
They're coming around, Jeremy.

01:43:15.808 --> 01:43:18.447
I can't make it, cap.
They're coming for you.

01:43:18.688 --> 01:43:20.246
You're wrong, Jer!

01:43:20.448 --> 01:43:21.722
They're coming for us.

01:43:22.448 --> 01:43:24.803
I'm not gonna leave you here, Jer.

01:43:25.808 --> 01:43:29.118
You have just one chance to
grab ahold of those nets.

01:43:29.328 --> 01:43:31.159
- You roger that?
- Okay.

01:43:38.888 --> 01:43:40.924
- Back full!
- Back full on!

01:43:51.168 --> 01:43:53.602
You gotta swim now, Jer!

01:44:03.928 --> 01:44:05.964
Grab it, Jer, just grab it!

01:44:21.688 --> 01:44:22.837
Come on!

01:44:32.608 --> 01:44:34.007
Climb! Climb!

01:44:34.928 --> 01:44:35.917
Reach!

01:44:42.288 --> 01:44:44.085
We lost one! Pick up the net!

01:44:46.248 --> 01:44:49.285
Come on! Give me your hand!

01:44:59.248 --> 01:45:03.764
Reach and grab it with everything
you got. Everything you've got!

01:45:09.768 --> 01:45:11.042
Hold on!

01:45:12.928 --> 01:45:14.407
Pull!

01:45:18.408 --> 01:45:21.320
Yes! Get them inside
and clear this deck.

01:45:26.128 --> 01:45:27.766
All right, let's go.

01:45:29.448 --> 01:45:32.565
There's another man out there!
There's another man!

01:45:32.768 --> 01:45:33.678
Jonesy!

01:45:34.808 --> 01:45:37.038
Jonesy!

01:46:37.208 --> 01:46:38.880
Skip, we're gonna make it.

01:47:18.088 --> 01:47:20.044
She's not gonna let us out.

01:47:45.608 --> 01:47:46.677
No.

01:47:55.248 --> 01:47:57.557
Come on, you bitch!

01:48:04.368 --> 01:48:06.324
Come on!

01:48:16.368 --> 01:48:17.767
Come on!

01:48:59.968 --> 01:49:02.038
Come on. We gotta get out.

01:49:05.448 --> 01:49:06.961
How do we do this, skip?

01:49:07.248 --> 01:49:08.840
No school for it.

01:49:09.048 --> 01:49:10.163
Never was.

01:49:32.728 --> 01:49:34.878
This is gonna be hard
on my little boy.

01:49:51.248 --> 01:49:52.203
Bobby...

01:49:53.608 --> 01:49:55.360
...I'm sorry I got you into this.

01:49:57.368 --> 01:49:59.438
Skip, we made the right call.

01:50:00.048 --> 01:50:01.481
We had to try.

01:50:03.048 --> 01:50:04.561
We were so close.

01:50:10.488 --> 01:50:12.956
It was a hell of a fight, though, huh?

01:50:22.448 --> 01:50:24.245
Let's get out of here, huh?

01:51:32.928 --> 01:51:34.361
<i>Christina.</i>

01:51:35.408 --> 01:51:37.319
<i>Christina, can you hear me?</i>

01:51:38.848 --> 01:51:41.760
<i>I don 't know if you can,</i>
<i>but I'm talking to you, baby.</i>

01:51:43.408 --> 01:51:45.478
<i>Do you know how much I love you?</i>

01:51:46.128 --> 01:51:48.358
<i>I loved you the moment I saw you.</i>

01:51:48.928 --> 01:51:50.202
<i>I love you now...</i>

01:51:51.208 --> 01:51:52.960
<i>... and I'll love you forever.</i>

01:51:54.288 --> 01:51:55.641
<i>No goodbye.</i>

01:51:56.848 --> 01:51:58.884
<i>There's only love, Christina.</i>

01:51:59.888 --> 01:52:01.162
<i>Only love.</i>

01:52:31.728 --> 01:52:34.447
<i>It's been a week of round-the-clock</i>
<i>flights involving...</i>

01:52:34.648 --> 01:52:37.640
<i>... efforts of half a dozen Northeast</i>
<i>air rescue stations.</i>

01:52:37.848 --> 01:52:41.636
<i>However, as of this hour, the Coast</i>
<i>Guard has suspended its search...</i>

01:52:41.848 --> 01:52:45.284
<i>... for Air National Guard</i>
<i>para-rescue jumper Millard Jones.</i>

01:52:45.488 --> 01:52:47.638
<i>He leaves a wife and three daughters.</i>

01:52:47.848 --> 01:52:50.362
<i>The search for the</i> Andrea Gail
<i>out of Gloucester...</i>

01:52:50.608 --> 01:52:53.645
<i>... has also been suspended</i>
<i>after aircrafts covered...</i>

01:52:53.848 --> 01:52:56.601
<i>... 116,000 square miles of ocean...</i>

01:52:56.808 --> 01:52:59.163
<i>... without finding a single survivor.</i>

01:52:59.368 --> 01:53:01.962
<i>We'll have more news</i>
<i>after these messages.</i>

01:53:54.808 --> 01:53:56.605
I knew Billy Tyne.

01:53:57.688 --> 01:54:00.202
I did not know his crew very well.

01:54:01.088 --> 01:54:04.967
But any man who sailed with him
must've been the better for it.

01:54:06.648 --> 01:54:08.127
Robert Shatford...

01:54:08.848 --> 01:54:10.361
...Dale Murphy...

01:54:11.088 --> 01:54:12.601
...Michael Moran...

01:54:13.328 --> 01:54:15.000
...David Sullivan...

01:54:15.728 --> 01:54:17.241
...Alfred Pierre...

01:54:18.728 --> 01:54:21.162
...may you rest easy, long-liners...

01:54:21.808 --> 01:54:24.925
...in fair winds and calm seas.

01:54:28.888 --> 01:54:30.765
For those of us left behind...

01:54:30.968 --> 01:54:33.880
...the unmarked grave which is
home for those lost at sea...

01:54:34.088 --> 01:54:35.760
...is of no consolation.

01:54:37.008 --> 01:54:38.726
It can't be visited.

01:54:39.128 --> 01:54:42.643
There is no headstone on which
to rest a bunch of flowers.

01:54:42.968 --> 01:54:45.436
The only place we can revisit them...

01:54:45.688 --> 01:54:48.646
...is in our hearts or in our dreams.

01:54:51.488 --> 01:54:54.764
They say swordboatmen suffer from
a lack of dreams.

01:54:55.848 --> 01:54:57.600
That's what begets their courage.

01:54:59.608 --> 01:55:01.678
Well, we'll dream for you...

01:55:02.448 --> 01:55:03.278
...Billy...

01:55:04.048 --> 01:55:05.447
...Bobby...

01:55:05.728 --> 01:55:07.047
...and Murph...

01:55:07.248 --> 01:55:08.476
...Bugsy...

01:55:08.728 --> 01:55:09.797
...Sully...

01:55:10.008 --> 01:55:11.885
...and Alfred Pierre.

01:55:14.288 --> 01:55:15.926
Sleep well.

01:55:16.408 --> 01:55:17.682
Good night.

01:55:42.808 --> 01:55:44.366
I'll be asleep...

01:55:44.568 --> 01:55:46.957
...and then all of a sudden,
there he is.

01:55:48.488 --> 01:55:50.080
That big smile.

01:55:50.288 --> 01:55:51.960
You know that smile.

01:55:53.368 --> 01:55:56.201
And I say,
"Hey, Bobby, where you been?"

01:55:56.928 --> 01:55:58.646
But he won't tell me.

01:55:59.208 --> 01:56:01.676
He just smiles and says:

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:05.000
"Remember I'll always love you,
Christina.

01:56:05.408 --> 01:56:08.081
I love you now,
and I'll love you forever.

01:56:08.648 --> 01:56:10.206
There's no goodbye.

01:56:10.968 --> 01:56:12.367
Only love."

01:56:13.808 --> 01:56:15.321
And then he's gone.

01:56:18.128 --> 01:56:20.483
But he's always happy when he goes.

01:56:20.808 --> 01:56:24.039
So I know he's gotta be okay.

01:56:25.248 --> 01:56:27.318
Absolutely okay.

01:56:34.768 --> 01:56:36.599
I love your dream.

01:56:45.568 --> 01:56:47.240
<i>The fog's just lifting.</i>

01:56:47.888 --> 01:56:50.721
<i>You throw off your bow line,</i>
<i>throw off your stern.</i>

01:56:51.008 --> 01:56:52.805
<i>You head out the South Channel...</i>

01:56:53.008 --> 01:56:55.841
<i>... past Rocky Neck,</i>
<i>Ten Pound Island...</i>

01:56:56.048 --> 01:56:58.801
<i>... past Niles Pond,</i>
<i>where I skated as a kid.</i>

01:56:59.488 --> 01:57:00.967
<i>You blow your horn and wave to...</i>

01:57:01.168 --> 01:57:03.682
<i>... the lighthouse keeper's kid</i>
<i>on Thatcher Island.</i>

01:57:04.808 --> 01:57:06.560
<i>Then the birds show up.</i>

01:57:06.888 --> 01:57:09.197
<i>Black-backs and herring gulls...</i>

01:57:09.688 --> 01:57:10.962
<i>... big dump ducks.</i>

01:57:11.568 --> 01:57:12.921
<i>The sun hits you.</i>

01:57:13.128 --> 01:57:14.880
<i>You head north, open up to 12.</i>

01:57:15.088 --> 01:57:16.567
<i>You're steaming now.</i>

01:57:17.328 --> 01:57:19.762
<i>The guys are busy,</i>
<i>you're in charge.</i>

01:57:20.488 --> 01:57:23.048
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>You're a goddamn swordboat captain.</i>

01:57:24.208 --> 01:57:26.164
<i>Is there anything better in the world?</i>

02:04:27.888 --> 02:04:28.877
