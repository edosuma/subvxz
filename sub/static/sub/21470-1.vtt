00:28.064 --> 00:31.231
...flight number 2671
now in final boarding...

00:45.897 --> 00:48.647
Jacob, it's Bianca.

00:50.356 --> 00:54.523
I'm in trouble. I need your help, please.

00:56.773 --> 00:58.690
I have something they want.

00:59.731 --> 01:02.481
Jacob, I don't know what to do.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.106
Please, call me.

01:14.064 --> 01:17.314
How long will you be staying here
in Los Angeles, Mr. King?

01:18.231 --> 01:19.231
One week.

01:19.897 --> 01:22.564
My return flight to Cape Town is on the 5th.

01:22.648 --> 01:24.898
It's there on the ticket, ma'am.

01:24.981 --> 01:27.856
You haven't given us an address
where you're gonna be staying.

01:29.981 --> 01:30.981
I'm not sure.

01:31.481 --> 01:34.731
Do you have any friends here, or any family?

01:35.731 --> 01:37.690
I have to find a hotel.

01:37.773 --> 01:42.398
With $600 in cash for seven days
and no credit card?

01:43.606 --> 01:44.897
I'll make it last.

01:45.523 --> 01:47.773
That's your idea of a vacation, Mr. King?

01:50.273 --> 01:52.522
Took me three months to save that...

01:53.811 --> 01:55.306
...and the ticket.

01:56.981 --> 01:58.231
I don't make much.

01:58.314 --> 02:00.106
You drive a cab in Cape Town?

02:02.648 --> 02:03.930
That's right.

02:04.356 --> 02:08.314
But you can make more money driving
a cab in Los Angeles, right, Mr. King?

02:08.981 --> 02:10.896
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

02:10.981 --> 02:13.939
Working, staying here in Los Angeles.

02:14.022 --> 02:18.772
I have no intentions of working...
or staying.

02:20.356 --> 02:21.731
And that's the truth.

03:59.648 --> 04:00.939
Do you have a room?

04:02.981 --> 04:04.689
Sixty-five a night, cash up front.

04:10.231 --> 04:11.772
I need to see an ID.

04:23.856 --> 04:26.398
My first name's George.
My rules or you're out.

04:26.481 --> 04:32.565
No hookers, queers, puntas, parties,
junk weed, crack, meth, or loud music.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.398
Not that you seem the type, Mr. King.

04:35.939 --> 04:37.064
202.

06:00.439 --> 06:01.847
Bianca.

06:08.730 --> 06:09.647
Bianca!

06:15.356 --> 06:19.106
- Hello? Can I help you?
- I hope so.

06:20.689 --> 06:22.231
I'm looking for someone.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.356
- I think I have the right address, but...
- Who are you looking for?

06:26.939 --> 06:31.522
My sister. Bianca Zagosin. Do you know her?

06:31.605 --> 06:35.231
- And you are?
- Her brother, Jacob.

06:38.180 --> 06:41.481
Yeah, I remember you.
I've seen you in photos. I'm Trish.

06:42.481 --> 06:43.689
Trish.

06:43.772 --> 06:45.481
You're a lot cuter in person.

06:45.730 --> 06:46.647
Come on in.

06:47.522 --> 06:50.148
- So, you just get in?
- Yeah.

06:50.231 --> 06:53.564
- My sister, she lives next door, nay?
- Used to.

06:54.231 --> 06:57.730
You know, I haven't talked to Bianca
in, like, forever.

06:57.814 --> 06:59.564
It was actually right around my birthday.

07:00.564 --> 07:02.814
I don't know, to me, she seemed fine.

07:02.897 --> 07:06.480
It's just all of a sudden,
she just bugged out.

07:06.564 --> 07:08.814
She just left, didn't say goodbye,
didn't say anything,

07:08.897 --> 07:11.314
didn't leave a forwarding address.
I asked the landlords.

07:12.106 --> 07:13.480
So they both moved out?

07:14.647 --> 07:16.440
Yeah. Her and Armand did.

07:16.522 --> 07:19.022
You mean Alex, her husband?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.772
No, her and Armand.

07:20.856 --> 07:22.939
Alex hasn't been around in forever.

07:24.522 --> 07:27.314
- Who's Armand?
- Their boy.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.314
Boy?

07:30.356 --> 07:34.439
- Bianca has a child?
- It's not hers. It's Alex's kid.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.231
How do you not know this?

07:37.689 --> 07:38.981
You guys don't talk much?

07:41.439 --> 07:44.981
No, no, but she tried calling,
and now her phone is disconnected.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.398
Oh, so you're just worried?

07:47.605 --> 07:49.064
She's my little sister.

07:50.439 --> 07:51.522
That's sweet.

07:53.064 --> 07:54.939
So, where did Alex go?

07:55.022 --> 07:57.148
They had a big argument.
She didn't tell me what about.

07:57.689 --> 08:01.148
And he just left her. With his kid?

08:01.897 --> 08:02.814
Yeah.

08:06.564 --> 08:07.522
You wanna sit down?

08:17.022 --> 08:18.064
You don't like Alex?

08:19.189 --> 08:22.522
I only met him once. In Cape Town.

08:23.605 --> 08:26.896
I think Alex got into
some sort of money trouble.

08:26.980 --> 08:28.814
It was a mess.

08:30.564 --> 08:31.439
Hey.

08:32.273 --> 08:35.063
This is Jacob, Bianca's brother.

08:35.647 --> 08:36.480
Cool.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.731
How'd the audition go?

08:41.730 --> 08:43.938
You've gotta be kidding me.
No more fucking ice!

08:48.147 --> 08:50.939
You know what?
Can you not do this shit right now?

08:53.605 --> 08:55.647
He's looking for Bianca. Give me one second.

08:55.730 --> 08:58.231
You know what? She left some stuff here.

08:58.314 --> 08:59.605
Let me grab that for you.

09:03.314 --> 09:04.981
What did she leave here?

09:05.064 --> 09:07.064
It's just a bag of her stuff, Bill.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.355
How could you let him in?

09:11.022 --> 09:11.897
Sorry about that.

09:13.273 --> 09:14.273
It's all right.

09:14.355 --> 09:16.189
We are having people over tonight.

09:16.273 --> 09:18.189
You're more than welcome to come.

09:18.314 --> 09:19.355
I told everyone 8:30,

09:19.439 --> 09:23.772
but stuff doesn't get really hopping
until, like, 10:30, so you should come by.

09:23.856 --> 09:26.730
- Okay.
- Great. See you later.

09:30.897 --> 09:33.981
Do you happen to know
who Bianca paid her rent to?

09:34.064 --> 09:35.189
Yeah, Mrs. Lazlo.

09:35.273 --> 09:37.981
Go down the street,
there's a white building, go to the back.

09:38.981 --> 09:40.522
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

09:41.439 --> 09:45.022
Excuse me for saying this, but your sister's
husband was a cheap son of a bitch.

09:45.106 --> 09:48.439
Wasn't one month I got the rent on time.
It was always a fight.

09:48.522 --> 09:52.064
Good thing they moved her out,
'cause I was about to throw her out.

09:52.148 --> 09:56.730
- Who moved her out?
- Oh, some pal of her old man's, Zeke...

09:57.981 --> 10:00.273
That's right, Zico.

10:00.355 --> 10:03.897
Slicked back hair, you know,
asshole, Mediterranean.

10:03.981 --> 10:05.981
Didn't expect the check to clear.

10:06.064 --> 10:10.064
- So, Bianca owes you money?
- No, he squared up on everything.

10:10.148 --> 10:12.022
God knows how she pulled that off.

10:12.106 --> 10:14.814
He didn't even complain
about losing the deposit.

10:14.897 --> 10:17.022
Guess he knew what a mess she was.

10:17.689 --> 10:19.647
Did you see her before she went?

10:20.231 --> 10:23.397
When she moved in here,
she was a nice young woman.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.480
Polite. Pretty, too.

10:27.022 --> 10:28.730
Last time I saw her, sonny...

10:29.564 --> 10:33.439
she looked terrible, beat up and strung out.

10:34.106 --> 10:36.272
I'm sorry, but that's how it was.

10:38.189 --> 10:41.231
This friend, Zico, I don't know him.

10:41.730 --> 10:43.355
Do you know where I can find him?

10:43.939 --> 10:47.522
The name on the check was Carbodiam Carwash.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.856
It's, uh... It's over on Prospect Street.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.296
Maybe he works there.

11:05.272 --> 11:06.272
Excuse me.

11:09.897 --> 11:11.772
I'm looking for Zico.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.647
There's nobody here called Zico.

11:14.897 --> 11:17.397
- Mm-hmm.
- What's this about, my friend?

11:19.480 --> 11:22.272
I'm looking for my sister. Bianca.

11:23.397 --> 11:24.438
Bianca Zagosin.

11:28.189 --> 11:32.022
Zico knows her.
He might be able to help me find her.

11:35.397 --> 11:37.272
There's nobody here called Zico.

11:41.564 --> 11:42.981
We can't help you.

12:27.772 --> 12:29.064
Hello.

13:45.188 --> 13:47.814
Excuse me. Is this the Yung Du Market?

14:00.981 --> 14:02.147
Excuse me.

14:03.063 --> 14:05.397
- Can I ask you a question?
- What you buying?

14:05.897 --> 14:07.147
I'm not buying anything, ma'am.

14:07.230 --> 14:10.397
I just want to know
if you've seen this woman.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.272
- No, I don't know. I don't know.
- This woman, does she...

14:14.355 --> 14:16.063
- Does she shop here?
- I'm busy. I'm working.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.981
Sorry. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

14:19.063 --> 14:20.897
Mom, what's the problem?

14:25.022 --> 14:26.063
What's going on, man?

14:26.147 --> 14:29.647
I only want to know if you've seen
this woman and perhaps the kid.

14:38.814 --> 14:42.811
- You're not from around here, are you?
- No. South Africa.

14:46.689 --> 14:51.021
I don't remember her,
but I've seen this kid in here for sure.

14:51.856 --> 14:53.355
When was the last time?

14:53.439 --> 14:56.814
Maybe two, three weeks ago. Who are they?

14:57.355 --> 14:58.981
My sister and her boy.

14:59.063 --> 15:01.689
I'm looking for them. They've disappeared.

15:06.856 --> 15:08.021
What did she say?

15:11.689 --> 15:13.522
She's asking if you've checked the morgue.

15:29.397 --> 15:32.522
All right, this is case number 4372.

15:33.272 --> 15:36.272
Female African-American,
found in a dumpster up on Manchester.

15:36.355 --> 15:40.147
Cause of death,
OD from prescribed psychiatric medication.

15:41.105 --> 15:43.147
Seems the dumpster was her home.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.480
- Not her.
- Yeah. All right.

15:51.564 --> 15:52.897
Back up, back up.

16:03.397 --> 16:06.439
Nah. It's the wrong demographic.

16:07.021 --> 16:12.063
Mid-50s, found in a bathtub,
trying to pretend she was a fish.

16:14.105 --> 16:17.021
All right, number 4410 right here.

16:17.105 --> 16:18.605
Yeah, I remember you, baby.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.856
Found in a stolen vehicle up on West Olympic.

16:21.938 --> 16:23.897
Cause of death,
blunt force trauma to the head.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.856
Made the Channel 4 news.

16:30.730 --> 16:33.730
We had one just like this
a couple years back.

16:33.814 --> 16:35.021
Gang shit.

16:35.605 --> 16:37.355
Man, them motherfucking gangs these days.

16:44.814 --> 16:46.230
Come on, tell me this ain't her.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.605
It's not her.

16:57.230 --> 17:00.814
God be praised.
Or are you all up into Allah and shit?

17:01.856 --> 17:03.188
I gotta say something here.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.063
You exotic Negroes
is some cold-blooded motherfuckers.

17:06.146 --> 17:08.605
Most people be in the john by now...

18:18.730 --> 18:21.147
Okay, enough of that. Just use your mouth.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.230
Oh.

18:22.772 --> 18:24.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:24.605 --> 18:25.980
Wrong room.

18:27.105 --> 18:30.730
It's the only room with the porno working,
so I gotta keep it free.

18:30.813 --> 18:31.772
Here you go.

18:33.230 --> 18:36.813
You're in 210 now.
Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. King.

19:41.355 --> 19:44.313
Now what the...
What the fuck do you want, man?

19:44.855 --> 19:46.313
What the fuck?

19:48.480 --> 19:49.439
Get him!

20:17.147 --> 20:19.855
Fuck! You're fucking with the wrong guy!

20:28.647 --> 20:29.771
Oh, God!

20:31.147 --> 20:32.896
Ah, shit!

20:35.230 --> 20:38.063
You killed my sister. You tortured her!

20:38.147 --> 20:40.188
Why? Why?

20:41.063 --> 20:43.230
- They told us to.
- Who told you?

20:48.564 --> 20:50.938
Give me back my fucking phone!

21:12.938 --> 21:17.771
Whoever you work for, tell them
this was a message from the King.

22:30.771 --> 22:33.729
Trish, open up the fucking door.
I know you're in there.

22:33.813 --> 22:36.938
Open the fucking door!

22:37.646 --> 22:39.021
Open the fucking door!

22:39.105 --> 22:41.272
I swear to God,
I'm gonna break this door down.

22:43.105 --> 22:44.604
Where is your girlfriend?

22:45.355 --> 22:48.438
Listen, man, we've had enough trouble
with your sister already.

22:48.522 --> 22:51.272
So I'd really appreciate it
if you leave Trish alone.

22:51.355 --> 22:52.188
Whoo!

22:52.272 --> 22:53.938
What the hell were you doing in there?

22:54.021 --> 22:55.063
- Bill, stop.
- Stop!

22:55.147 --> 22:57.230
Why do you always have to get so fucked up?

22:57.313 --> 22:58.646
- Stop.
- Come here.

22:59.771 --> 23:01.230
You must be Jacob.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.896
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Bianca's brother, right?

23:06.313 --> 23:07.688
So, how long are you in town for?

23:12.688 --> 23:14.397
I'm glad you made it.

23:15.272 --> 23:17.230
What's wrong? You look a little tense.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.105
Are you okay?

23:19.855 --> 23:22.646
- We need to talk.
- Okay, let's talk.

23:28.021 --> 23:30.063
Did you do this with Bianca?

23:34.938 --> 23:36.646
You do other things with her?

23:39.230 --> 23:40.896
Is that why he hates her?

23:42.147 --> 23:43.563
Your boyfriend?

23:46.771 --> 23:49.896
I liked her. She liked me.

23:56.771 --> 23:57.855
And I like you.

24:01.188 --> 24:03.313
Did Bianca do a lot of blow?

24:08.771 --> 24:10.813
Did she score it for you?

24:18.896 --> 24:22.355
She turned me on to Zico's boy, Frankie.

24:24.521 --> 24:25.771
Deals on wheels.

24:27.813 --> 24:29.363
Who is Zico?

24:34.729 --> 24:37.938
- How do you know him?
- He's one of Alex's boys.

24:44.397 --> 24:45.896
What are you doing?

24:50.105 --> 24:51.604
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry.

24:51.688 --> 24:53.813
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24:53.896 --> 24:56.688
I'm sorry. No, no, come here.
Look at me, look at me.

24:56.771 --> 24:59.313
Hey, look at me. Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

24:59.396 --> 25:00.771
No...

25:00.855 --> 25:03.147
Nothing happened. Nothing happened.

25:03.230 --> 25:04.980
Nothing happened.

25:05.063 --> 25:06.688
Come here. Come here.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.646
How much for an eight ball?

25:58.771 --> 26:00.563
- Sorry?
- You heard me.

26:01.980 --> 26:03.354
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.396
Does he think I'm dealing or something?

26:05.479 --> 26:06.980
That's what I've been told.

26:07.855 --> 26:12.063
- Patricia, who is this guy?
- It's Bianca's brother.

26:12.147 --> 26:14.063
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

26:16.938 --> 26:18.896
It's good to meet you, mate. Welcome.

26:19.313 --> 26:21.396
What brings you to this neck of the woods?

26:21.479 --> 26:23.147
I'm looking for Bianca.

26:24.188 --> 26:25.105
Right.

26:25.855 --> 26:28.063
I haven't actually seen her
for a while, I'm afraid.

26:29.563 --> 26:31.521
It's like everyone in this fucking place.

26:31.604 --> 26:33.938
They're here one minute, gone the next.

26:34.021 --> 26:35.729
Fucking nomadic culture, you know?

26:37.312 --> 26:38.646
Yeah.

26:41.147 --> 26:43.855
I have to wonder why
she'd lose touch with her dealer,

26:43.938 --> 26:45.855
with her drug problem and all that.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.646
Keep your fucking voice down, mate.

26:47.729 --> 26:49.479
And I'm not a dealer, okay?

26:49.563 --> 26:53.396
I deal in pleasure, and I deliver it
to a very select fucking few.

26:53.479 --> 26:55.563
You get to cussing when you get nervous,
did you know that?

26:55.646 --> 26:57.771
'Course I'm fucking nervous.

26:57.855 --> 27:00.396
You're going around shouting
that I'm some shithead dealer.

27:00.479 --> 27:03.938
It's a reasonable question.
You are her dealer.

27:04.938 --> 27:08.021
You probably know where she is. Do you?

27:11.479 --> 27:12.813
- You're off.
- What?

27:12.896 --> 27:15.188
You're off the fucking list. Jesus Christ.

27:16.604 --> 27:17.813
What the fuck is your problem?

27:18.271 --> 27:20.438
I mean, who even talks to someone like that?

27:33.271 --> 27:34.729
Yes, he's here.

27:34.813 --> 27:37.063
Of course I'm fucking sure.
I was talking to him, mate.

27:37.855 --> 27:39.563
Hey, what are you doing?

27:50.729 --> 27:52.980
You didn't answer my question.
Why did they kill Bianca?

27:53.063 --> 27:54.438
- I don't...
- Why?

27:54.938 --> 27:58.188
All right. All right.
All right, she fucking...

27:58.271 --> 28:00.705
- Tell me.
- She pissed them off.

28:01.688 --> 28:03.229
She had something that they wanted.

28:03.312 --> 28:06.271
I don't know what the fuck it was though.
I swear I don't know.

28:06.354 --> 28:09.938
- Pissed who off? Pissed who off?
- The guys Zico works for.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.479
Who does he work for?

28:13.271 --> 28:17.021
All right. It's the... It's th...
It's the Du... The Duke.

28:17.105 --> 28:20.354
All right.
He's called the fucking Duke, I swear.

28:20.437 --> 28:21.646
Let him go!

28:25.938 --> 28:27.646
Get inside!

28:27.729 --> 28:28.896
Go tell Duke.

28:28.980 --> 28:31.787
That's not mine. He's gonna fucking kill me.

29:58.354 --> 30:00.438
I saw you out there.

30:02.521 --> 30:03.521
Um...

30:05.063 --> 30:07.938
About earlier...

30:08.563 --> 30:09.438
you know...

30:10.354 --> 30:12.354
the guy at the motel?

30:13.354 --> 30:16.229
I wanted to say thank you.

30:19.021 --> 30:20.063
For what?

30:22.146 --> 30:24.187
For not, um...

30:29.021 --> 30:30.187
I don't fuck them.

30:32.062 --> 30:34.354
You have to keep a roof over your head.

30:35.396 --> 30:36.229
Nay?

30:48.688 --> 30:50.104
Let me see that.

30:50.187 --> 30:51.396
Wow.

30:52.438 --> 30:53.771
She's pretty.

30:54.855 --> 30:55.980
Who is she?

31:01.938 --> 31:04.187
So, what are you doing
in this shitty ass place?

31:06.021 --> 31:09.062
You mean here? Or Los Angeles?

31:10.479 --> 31:11.646
Both.

31:14.479 --> 31:15.771
Is it about her?

31:23.438 --> 31:24.688
You looking for her?

31:27.688 --> 31:30.354
Everybody's looking for something
in this place.

31:31.521 --> 31:33.563
You come here looking
for the one thing in the world

31:33.646 --> 31:35.729
that you think is gonna make you happy.

31:38.020 --> 31:40.062
And then after a few years...

31:41.646 --> 31:43.688
all you wanna do is get the hell out.

31:49.521 --> 31:51.855
Have you ever seen this place in the rain?

31:54.479 --> 31:58.813
It's like rotting cardboard. Same smell.

32:01.979 --> 32:05.354
But then, the rain clears and the sun shines,

32:05.438 --> 32:08.479
and the air smells like jasmine and orange.

32:10.437 --> 32:12.979
And you think that maybe...

32:15.312 --> 32:17.271
maybe it's not so bad.

32:18.646 --> 32:20.604
Maybe you're gonna stay and...

32:23.354 --> 32:24.979
give it another go.

32:29.438 --> 32:32.771
And then what you think
was a pile of trash gets up and...

32:33.813 --> 32:36.479
starts pushing a cart full of cans.

32:38.312 --> 32:40.271
Sleeping under a bridge.

32:44.937 --> 32:47.271
The little girl with you at the motel...

32:48.312 --> 32:49.896
is she your daughter?

32:51.479 --> 32:52.354
Yeah.

32:53.104 --> 32:56.438
- How old is she?
- She's eight.

32:58.479 --> 32:59.521
Give this to her.

33:00.688 --> 33:06.104
I think maybe she will like it
because it has the elephant on it.

33:11.271 --> 33:13.020
She loves elephants.

33:19.479 --> 33:20.354
Thank you.

33:21.979 --> 33:23.646
I'm Kelly, by the way.

33:25.396 --> 33:27.937
- Jacob.
- Jacob.

33:30.271 --> 33:32.187
It was nice talking to you.

33:38.855 --> 33:40.187
Okay.

34:40.937 --> 34:43.228
- Hey.
- Hello. Um...

34:43.937 --> 34:46.478
Can you hold onto this for me?

34:46.563 --> 34:49.353
I have to go out.
I don't want to leave it in the room.

34:51.187 --> 34:52.271
Okay.

34:56.478 --> 34:59.312
EksÃª, I have a favor to ask.

35:00.563 --> 35:02.187
You've got a car, nay?

35:02.271 --> 35:05.438
Can I use it? Only for a few hours.

35:06.354 --> 35:07.396
I can pay you.

35:12.563 --> 35:14.396
Hell, that's more money than it's worth.

35:15.187 --> 35:16.062
Hang on.

35:21.563 --> 35:23.104
Fucked up Camry downstairs.

35:23.187 --> 35:26.729
- New Mexico plates, can't miss it.
- Thank you.

35:27.729 --> 35:28.812
You wanna come in?

35:31.729 --> 35:32.854
This is Boot.

35:32.937 --> 35:34.646
No, no, it's all right.

35:34.729 --> 35:38.062
- I have to go. Chop, chop.
- Okay.

35:41.604 --> 35:45.312
Oh, my God. Are you fucking kidding me?
Get out of here. Get away.

35:45.396 --> 35:47.396
Did Bianca leave anything else with you?

35:47.479 --> 35:51.563
- Dude, back the fuck off my space.
- She had something they wanted.

35:51.646 --> 35:53.770
I don't give a shit about your problems.

35:53.854 --> 35:55.062
- Tell me!
- Get out of here!

35:55.146 --> 35:57.729
Tell me everything that happened with Alex!

35:57.812 --> 36:00.229
Tell me the truth! The truth.

36:01.312 --> 36:02.312
- Huh?
- Okay.

36:02.479 --> 36:05.354
They argued all the time. Okay?

36:05.438 --> 36:08.770
I heard them. They argued all the time.

36:09.354 --> 36:12.229
- And one day, Alex was just gone.
- Where?

36:12.812 --> 36:15.979
I don't fucking know.
She said they had a big fight.

36:16.646 --> 36:19.521
All his shit was still there.
I don't fucking know, man.

36:19.604 --> 36:21.354
He just left, all right?

36:22.646 --> 36:25.646
She wasn't even fucking mad.
She was just scared.

36:27.271 --> 36:28.812
What happened after that?

36:28.895 --> 36:30.979
She came to me one day
and gave me a fucking bag

36:31.062 --> 36:33.521
with all her shit in it,
and told me not to tell Zico.

36:33.604 --> 36:35.728
I mean, I don't know, man.

36:35.812 --> 36:37.937
She was fucking freaked out about something.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.521
What do you want me to tell you?

36:41.104 --> 36:44.979
- Was Bianca getting her teeth fixed?
- What?

36:45.062 --> 36:48.104
Her teeth. Was she getting her teeth fixed?

36:50.895 --> 36:53.187
Bianca wasn't getting shit fucking fixed.

36:59.020 --> 37:00.770
You're fucking crazy, man.

37:01.979 --> 37:03.895
I found Bianca at the morgue.

37:04.687 --> 37:05.937
She'd been tortured.

37:06.937 --> 37:08.438
They cut off her foot.

37:09.187 --> 37:10.728
They blinded her.

37:13.104 --> 37:16.229
Don't... Don't tell me that shit.

37:16.312 --> 37:19.062
Don't fucking come over to my house
and tell me that shit!

37:19.604 --> 37:21.604
You don't think I cared for her?

37:22.104 --> 37:24.312
I was the only person that cared for her!

37:24.396 --> 37:25.937
Where the fuck were you?

38:40.937 --> 38:42.062
This is Duke.

38:45.812 --> 38:46.770
Hello?

38:59.770 --> 39:01.770
Mr. Lawenda. I called.

39:01.854 --> 39:04.187
- I have an 11:30 appointment.
- Of course.

39:04.271 --> 39:06.937
You haven't seen Dr. Wentworth before,
have you, Mr. Lawenda?

39:07.020 --> 39:09.146
No, but I have seen his work.

39:09.229 --> 39:12.479
If you could fill this out, Dr. Wentworth
will be with you in a moment.

39:13.603 --> 39:14.603
Very good.

39:21.146 --> 39:22.146
Mr. Lawenda?

39:24.603 --> 39:27.895
Mr. Lawenda? Dr. Wentworth's ready for you.

39:33.603 --> 39:34.479
Mr. Lawenda.

39:36.354 --> 39:39.854
A man after my own heart.
You don't like filling in forms.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.770
Not a problem.
I'll get everything as we go along.

39:44.438 --> 39:47.479
Now your notes say
you've been having some pain.

39:48.354 --> 39:52.020
Let's take a look at those top molars,
shall we? Open wide.

39:59.770 --> 40:01.562
Nothing immediately apparent.

40:04.979 --> 40:06.728
You should get some X-rays, I think.

40:08.271 --> 40:10.229
It says your sister referred you.

40:10.770 --> 40:12.937
- I don't think I remember her.
- Bianca.

40:14.187 --> 40:16.104
Bianca, of course.

40:16.645 --> 40:18.187
Bianca left me your name.

40:19.396 --> 40:21.062
She also left me something else.

40:23.478 --> 40:25.520
I'm looking after it for her.

40:25.603 --> 40:27.562
It's something I think you want.

40:28.895 --> 40:30.354
I can't imagine what that would be.

40:31.687 --> 40:33.187
I'm afraid...

40:33.812 --> 40:37.146
there wasn't much Bianca had that anyone
in their right mind would want.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.728
Apart from her looks, of course.

40:43.229 --> 40:44.312
And her teeth.

40:45.728 --> 40:48.728
They must be beautiful now,
with all the work she had done on them.

40:50.020 --> 40:53.396
I wasn't expecting to be paid,
if that's what you're suggesting.

40:54.396 --> 40:55.854
This isn't about money.

40:56.937 --> 40:58.354
It nearly always is.

40:59.895 --> 41:03.854
You know, part of me's been wondering
if someone would come looking for her.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.062
Hoping, in fact.

41:07.271 --> 41:10.229
I hated the idea that she was just
another Los Angeles orphan

41:10.312 --> 41:12.229
who might sink without trace.

41:13.562 --> 41:15.562
I always meant to ask her
if she had any family.

41:20.396 --> 41:23.812
Well... you're my last appointment
of the morning.

41:24.687 --> 41:25.937
Can I buy you some lunch?

41:26.520 --> 41:28.062
The average middle-class American

41:28.146 --> 41:30.895
spends almost a thousand bucks
on each of those teeth in their lifetime.

41:32.020 --> 41:34.645
You multiply that four or five times
in a place like this.

41:37.146 --> 41:39.812
My point is, I have a very good reputation...

41:40.062 --> 41:43.271
I have a very good practice,
and, all in all, a very good life.

41:43.854 --> 41:46.354
There would be very little sense in me
jeopardizing that.

41:50.312 --> 41:51.728
Let me tell you something.

41:53.312 --> 41:57.645
Dentists are for men
what gynecologists are for women.

41:58.229 --> 42:01.603
Once you have them wide open
and your hand is inside them...

42:01.687 --> 42:04.770
their sense of shame just drops away.

42:04.854 --> 42:07.395
You become trusted with their confidences.

42:08.229 --> 42:10.312
Sometimes, you send them home
with a prescription

42:10.395 --> 42:12.687
that's a little more fun
than what the problem requires.

42:13.146 --> 42:14.271
And other times...

42:15.520 --> 42:19.229
Well, if you can help out
a little more substantively

42:19.312 --> 42:22.437
and nobody's going to get hurt,
then why not help out?

42:24.770 --> 42:26.770
What if somebody did get hurt?

42:28.520 --> 42:29.562
Bianca?

42:30.770 --> 42:33.645
Why would you say that?
She could be anywhere right now.

42:34.312 --> 42:37.520
She could be sitting in the Starbucks
around the corner, for all we know.

42:37.603 --> 42:40.187
She was always disappearing,
and she always turns up again.

42:40.271 --> 42:41.520
You know Bianca.

42:41.603 --> 42:43.104
I used to think so.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.687
I'm not sure if I do anymore.

42:49.603 --> 42:52.312
- Where did you meet?
- At a party.

42:54.478 --> 42:55.687
She had a lot going for her.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.728
I know people. She wanted me
to make some introductions,

42:59.812 --> 43:02.979
- and so I did. I helped her out.
- Did you sleep with her?

43:03.603 --> 43:06.104
No. As a matter of fact, I didn't.

43:06.187 --> 43:07.812
- I'm married.
- So was she.

43:07.895 --> 43:09.854
Look, I'm not apologizing for it.

43:10.520 --> 43:12.229
She needed the money.

43:12.311 --> 43:14.187
She never did anything she didn't want to do.

43:15.603 --> 43:18.146
Why did some man move out all her things...

43:18.728 --> 43:22.146
- and pay all her debt?
- I'm the wrong one to ask, I'm afraid.

43:23.979 --> 43:25.687
All I know is that her husband

43:25.770 --> 43:30.586
got himself into some serious trouble,
owed some money to the wrong guys.

43:32.271 --> 43:34.979
Last I heard,
he wound up in a ditch somewhere.

43:36.271 --> 43:39.062
After he was gone,
Bianca got strung out. She...

43:39.520 --> 43:41.520
She started doing stuff
she shouldn't have been doing.

43:45.062 --> 43:49.062
If she has any sense, she's probably
got the hell out of Dodge for a while.

43:50.562 --> 43:52.229
That's most likely what she did.

43:56.020 --> 43:58.520
Well, goodbye then, Mr...

43:58.895 --> 44:00.937
I guess it must be King.

44:01.311 --> 44:04.854
Bianca's maiden name, right? King.
She told me. Bianca King.

44:05.437 --> 44:06.562
Yeah.

44:06.645 --> 44:09.812
I'm sorry I can't be any more help,
but you'll find her, I'm sure.

44:10.146 --> 44:12.854
Bianca plays the innocent,
but she's a survivor.

44:12.937 --> 44:14.187
Trust me, she's fine.

44:14.270 --> 44:17.187
And if there's anything else I can do,
just give me a call, okay?

46:21.145 --> 46:23.228
I run 20 hours a day.

46:23.311 --> 46:24.937
Nineteen I work.

46:25.020 --> 46:27.228
One I get to myself, one.

46:27.311 --> 46:29.854
You know what I do? I come down here, alone.

46:30.395 --> 46:32.353
No staffers. Nothing.

46:32.436 --> 46:34.020
We had an agreement.

46:34.103 --> 46:37.228
Until the campaign was over,
your office in Beverly Hills,

46:37.311 --> 46:40.062
me in the chair, is the only place we'd meet.

46:40.145 --> 46:42.186
We did. We agreed.

46:43.645 --> 46:45.103
I've got a situation, Frank.

46:45.770 --> 46:47.020
What do you want?

46:47.603 --> 46:49.603
Something I want to get rid of.

46:49.687 --> 46:51.770
I need one of your special favors.

46:51.854 --> 46:55.062
I thought you had associates
who could handle that kind of thing.

46:55.687 --> 46:57.687
This is way out of their league.

46:57.770 --> 47:00.020
I need this done right.
That's why I've come to you.

47:05.436 --> 47:08.103
Two men. 25 each.

47:09.270 --> 47:12.103
Fifty grand? Jesus.

47:12.979 --> 47:15.103
I don't know what this is about,
and I don't want to know.

47:15.687 --> 47:19.520
- You don't nickel and dime me on it.
- All right. I understand.

47:21.603 --> 47:25.311
If anybody saw you here... you're my dentist.

47:25.395 --> 47:29.211
You came down here personally
to give me a campaign donation.

47:30.186 --> 47:32.895
Fine. You've got my vote.

47:35.020 --> 47:36.836
Don't forget to floss, Frank.

48:58.061 --> 49:02.019
- Hello, Dr. Wentworth.
- Martine, how are you?

49:02.103 --> 49:04.562
- Good, how are you?
- Very well.

49:05.270 --> 49:07.937
- I've been flossing like you said.
- Let's have a look.

49:09.687 --> 49:12.436
Very good. Where's Mike?

49:17.603 --> 49:20.854
Tom, you gotta hold steady.
Just focus on the positives.

49:20.936 --> 49:24.311
There's a core audience out there,
you know. We can build on that.

49:24.395 --> 49:27.478
I've been down this road
a hundred times, and so have you.

49:27.562 --> 49:29.395
Yeah. Now trust me on this.

49:29.478 --> 49:32.103
All right, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Okay, till then.

49:33.019 --> 49:34.812
Hey, you still there? Okay, listen to me.

49:34.895 --> 49:38.145
I don't care what the contractor says.
I don't care what the engineer says.

49:38.228 --> 49:41.436
I hate that bathroom,
and I fucking hate that kitchen.

49:47.687 --> 49:51.520
You do what I say, or you can go back
to designing those strip malls, okay?

49:52.103 --> 49:53.103
Jesus.

49:57.228 --> 50:01.520
I ask my architect to change one little
thing, move one little door, he freaks out.

50:01.603 --> 50:03.562
- Artists.
- Eh, tell me about it.

50:03.645 --> 50:05.770
He's worse than a fucking director.

50:07.019 --> 50:10.019
I got a $100 million movie
that's tracking like a turkey,

50:10.103 --> 50:11.687
and it opens in two weeks.

50:11.770 --> 50:14.645
I got a TV series that's just been
picked up, I still haven't cast it.

50:15.311 --> 50:17.520
And then my dentist... Ho-ho.

50:17.603 --> 50:21.145
My dentist leaves me a message
saying he's got to meet me at my house,

50:21.228 --> 50:23.145
and then he doesn't pick up the phone.

50:24.061 --> 50:25.812
This better be good, Paul.

50:26.936 --> 50:28.728
So, what is it? What have you come to say?

50:29.395 --> 50:30.520
It's Bianca.

50:31.894 --> 50:32.978
She's got a brother.

50:34.478 --> 50:37.353
He's in town,
says he has what we've been looking for.

50:39.019 --> 50:40.311
He's out of control, Mike.

50:40.395 --> 50:42.687
You told me Bianca was not a problem anymore.

50:42.770 --> 50:44.812
Bianca isn't a problem anymore.

50:44.894 --> 50:46.853
I'm afraid that's his problem.

50:48.520 --> 50:49.770
Oh, my God, you didn't.

50:51.395 --> 50:55.395
- Your guys didn't... Please tell me no.
- Look, spare me the hand-wringing.

50:55.478 --> 50:57.353
You said handle it, it got handled.

50:59.270 --> 51:02.711
- What does he want?
- $750,000.

51:04.103 --> 51:06.853
Three quarters of a million bucks,
is he fucking nuts?

51:06.936 --> 51:07.936
Yes.

51:11.812 --> 51:15.395
I spent three hours in my office this
morning patching up one of Duke's men.

51:15.853 --> 51:18.437
This isn't negotiable, Mike.
You've got no leverage here.

51:18.520 --> 51:21.186
I've seen what this guy can do.
He's not like his sister.

51:21.728 --> 51:23.603
Sounds to me
he's just like his fucking sister.

51:24.395 --> 51:26.687
- His teeth...
- His teeth?

51:26.770 --> 51:31.228
They're not like hers.
Compound fillings, recent bridge...

51:31.853 --> 51:33.520
This guy takes care of himself.

51:33.603 --> 51:36.145
- You've seen this guy's teeth?
- Oh, yes.

51:36.728 --> 51:39.186
You can tell a lot from a person's teeth.

51:39.770 --> 51:44.019
- Like what?
- Like he's not going to go away.

51:46.936 --> 51:49.019
Like he's not going to screw up.

51:49.103 --> 51:51.894
- We have to deal with him, Mike.
- Seven hundred and fif...

51:54.186 --> 51:55.311
No fucking way.

51:56.645 --> 52:00.019
Did Bianca ever talk to you
about where she was from?

52:01.894 --> 52:04.562
- South Africa somewhere.
- Cape Flats.

52:05.478 --> 52:07.769
Has one of the highest murder rates
in the world.

52:08.311 --> 52:09.936
The Number gangs, you heard of them?

52:11.019 --> 52:12.103
Bianca got out.

52:14.936 --> 52:16.270
Her brother stayed.

52:17.270 --> 52:20.228
We have no idea what he's capable of.

52:24.395 --> 52:26.645
There is an alternative, but...

52:26.728 --> 52:29.103
you probably won't want to consider it.

52:29.978 --> 52:31.228
Try me.

52:32.520 --> 52:33.853
I spoke to Leary.

52:34.769 --> 52:38.186
- He's willing to help us out.
- Leary? Are you out of your fucking mind?

52:38.270 --> 52:40.353
Leary is running for office,
for Christ's sake.

52:40.436 --> 52:42.978
He finds out he's on that thing too,
we're all dead.

52:43.061 --> 52:44.811
This is your mess, Mike.

52:45.395 --> 52:46.562
How much does Leary want?

52:46.645 --> 52:48.687
A hundred grand. Cash.

52:55.687 --> 52:59.019
First you fix our teeth,
then you suck our dicks,

52:59.103 --> 53:00.353
then you suck our blood.

53:00.436 --> 53:02.478
Fuck you, you tick. You fucking nobody.

53:02.562 --> 53:04.769
Fucking nobody fucking dentist!

53:05.978 --> 53:09.186
That 750, I'm still going to need it.

53:09.270 --> 53:10.936
You said a hundred!
What are you talking about?

53:11.019 --> 53:13.353
- I gave you a hundred!
- Not for Leary, Mike.

53:13.437 --> 53:14.562
For me.

53:15.103 --> 53:16.270
You're squeezing me?

53:16.936 --> 53:18.769
You're fucking squeezing me?

53:19.186 --> 53:21.145
That's a fucking loser's plan, pal.

53:21.228 --> 53:23.311
You arranged all this!
It was your fucking party!

53:23.395 --> 53:26.395
Yes, but at your house.
I'm there, but I'm not in the room.

53:26.478 --> 53:30.769
I'm not doing what you're doing, Mike,
and I'm just your fucking nobody dentist.

53:30.853 --> 53:35.103
Worst I get is a red face, but you,
everything you have, you'll be gone, Mike.

53:35.186 --> 53:36.853
Out. Finito.

53:38.769 --> 53:39.769
Fuck you.

53:40.562 --> 53:43.103
Fuck you! Fuck you!

53:43.186 --> 53:46.228
- How is he?
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

53:49.061 --> 53:50.061
Are you okay, Mike?

53:50.145 --> 53:52.186
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No.

53:53.437 --> 53:56.103
You take off. I'll see you in the morning.

53:58.019 --> 53:59.061
Where are the boys?

54:00.936 --> 54:03.353
Oh, uh, the usual.

54:04.019 --> 54:04.936
Killing each other.

55:25.686 --> 55:28.228
- Yes?
- This is Paul Wentworth.

55:28.936 --> 55:32.145
- Frank Leary gave me your number.
- What's the job?

55:51.061 --> 55:53.145
Pull over to the right.

56:02.103 --> 56:03.311
Shit.

56:12.270 --> 56:14.395
License and registration, please, sir.

56:26.894 --> 56:31.186
Are you aware you should have registered
this vehicle two years ago, sir?

56:32.228 --> 56:34.811
- It belongs to a friend.
- A friend?

56:35.519 --> 56:36.561
Your license, please.

56:36.644 --> 56:39.186
I'm sorry, officer, my wallet's at my hotel.

56:40.019 --> 56:42.811
You're required by law
to have your license with you

56:42.894 --> 56:44.644
whenever you drive.

56:44.727 --> 56:47.727
Yeah, my apologies. That was my mistake.

56:50.727 --> 56:53.228
- Step out of the car, please, sir.
- You see, officer,

56:53.311 --> 56:56.311
- I'm not from here.
- Step out of the car, please, sir.

57:11.853 --> 57:15.186
- What's your name?
- Jacob King.

57:18.353 --> 57:22.270
JJ Motel, 1723 Argyle, room 210.

57:23.353 --> 57:24.602
Jacob King.

57:26.145 --> 57:28.686
Yeah, it's him.
What do you want us to do with him?

57:30.769 --> 57:31.769
Yeah.

58:03.519 --> 58:04.853
Call the police!

58:04.936 --> 58:06.978
- Please!
- What the fuck?

58:07.061 --> 58:09.602
- They're gonna kill me!
- Mom, look!

58:10.602 --> 58:13.811
Help me! Help me! Help me!

58:13.894 --> 58:16.769
- Calm the fuck down.
- Please help me! Help me!

58:16.853 --> 58:18.978
- Calm down!
- They're gonna kill me!

58:19.061 --> 58:21.727
- Calm the fuck down!
- They're gonna kill me!

58:24.145 --> 58:26.145
- Hey!
- Calm the fuck down!

58:31.769 --> 58:32.602
Jesus.

59:19.228 --> 59:20.811
Let's finish him here.

59:23.727 --> 59:25.311
We can leave him in the dumpster.

59:25.894 --> 59:28.644
He said the harbor, we do the harbor.

59:28.727 --> 59:30.644
Fuck the harbor. Let's just go.

59:30.727 --> 59:31.811
Get the car.

59:33.061 --> 59:34.602
Get the fucking car.

59:36.602 --> 59:37.602
Fine.

59:57.228 --> 59:58.228
Hey!

01:00:03.186 --> 01:00:04.186
You!

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:08.811
- What are you doing over there?
- Get the fuck out of here!

01:00:08.894 --> 01:00:09.936
You a cop?

01:00:10.019 --> 01:00:12.811
Yeah, what's it to you?
I said get the fuck out.

01:00:14.186 --> 01:00:17.394
Okay. Okay, man. We don't want no trouble.

01:00:30.145 --> 01:00:30.978
Fuck!

01:00:40.145 --> 01:00:41.394
Where the hell is he?

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:50.686
How the hell did you lose him?

01:00:51.352 --> 01:00:53.103
What the fuck are we gonna tell him?

01:00:53.186 --> 01:00:55.103
- If he finds out about this...
- No.

01:00:56.061 --> 01:00:57.727
We tell him he's dead.

01:00:58.978 --> 01:01:00.936
We tell him he's fucking dead!

01:01:34.352 --> 01:01:35.519
Jacob.

01:01:39.727 --> 01:01:42.436
Okay. Hold on.

01:01:42.519 --> 01:01:46.685
Okay, that's it. Okay. Okay. Keep going.

01:01:52.561 --> 01:01:55.853
Okay. Okay.

01:01:58.698 --> 01:02:00.310
Okay.

01:02:05.752 --> 01:02:08.243
Okay. Shit.

01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:15.644
You made a sound investment. Problem's gone.

01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:17.102
Good.

01:03:18.436 --> 01:03:19.686
Good. Excellent.

01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:23.853
I still want that 750. I'm giving you
48 hours. I'll be waiting for your call.

01:03:23.936 --> 01:03:26.144
Jesus Christ, Paul. You know what you are?

01:03:26.686 --> 01:03:29.477
You're nothing but a cheap blackmailing fuck.

01:03:29.561 --> 01:03:30.936
And what are you, Mike?

01:04:13.853 --> 01:04:15.394
- Mr. Audubon...
- Susan.

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:19.436
- I've taken some pills. I think I'm dying.
- Susan.

01:04:20.894 --> 01:04:23.436
- Get an ambulance!
- She just fell over.

01:04:29.769 --> 01:04:31.686
Why are you just sleeping?

01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:39.436
Did you get right back there? That's right.

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:45.936
Okay, I love you. Sweet dreams.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

01:04:54.477 --> 01:04:56.519
How many times, guys?

01:04:56.602 --> 01:04:59.894
- King's dead.
- All right, we checked the morgue.

01:04:59.978 --> 01:05:03.477
Nobody pulled out of water.
No black John Does, either.

01:05:03.561 --> 01:05:05.894
They all got names. King's not one of them.

01:05:05.978 --> 01:05:08.477
And the car he was driving?
Out of state plates.

01:05:08.561 --> 01:05:12.769
- Where'd he get it, huh? Huh?
- Jesus, guys.

01:05:12.853 --> 01:05:15.602
He stole it. Who knows? Who fucking cares?

01:05:15.686 --> 01:05:17.602
Guy's far out to sea by now.

01:05:18.227 --> 01:05:19.227
He's crab food.

01:05:19.853 --> 01:05:24.853
Why Leary, Paul? Why take that risk?
My guys could have handled King.

01:05:25.894 --> 01:05:26.769
Oh, yeah?

01:05:27.477 --> 01:05:29.644
Like they handled him last time?

01:05:33.144 --> 01:05:37.394
- What did the cops cost?
- Fifty large each. Preston paid.

01:05:37.977 --> 01:05:41.394
Paid you? Or did you pay Leary?

01:05:45.477 --> 01:05:48.811
I don't like this, Paul. Any of it.

01:05:48.894 --> 01:05:51.602
There is shit you're not telling me.

01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:54.060
There always is.

01:05:54.727 --> 01:05:56.185
You leveraging Preston?

01:05:58.185 --> 01:05:59.352
Is that it?

01:05:59.935 --> 01:06:01.102
Huh?

01:06:01.686 --> 01:06:03.185
What are you getting?

01:06:06.977 --> 01:06:09.977
We're partners, Paul.
We split down the middle.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.394
That's the deal.

01:06:12.144 --> 01:06:15.561
I find out you're fucking me again,
it'll be last time.

01:06:16.144 --> 01:06:17.811
Don't get all Balkan on me, Duke.

01:06:19.352 --> 01:06:23.102
You think my clients give a damn
who supplies me the drugs and the girls?

01:06:23.185 --> 01:06:24.352
You think I do?

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:29.269
Bianca's dead and gone.

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:31.435
So's her brother.

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:56.935
Leary has also seen an increasing list

01:06:57.018 --> 01:06:59.102
of high-profile local business leaders

01:06:59.185 --> 01:07:03.310
and entertainment personalities
stepping onboard to endorse Leary

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:07.185
and his strong anti-City Hall,
anti-corruption...

01:07:17.352 --> 01:07:18.852
What is this?

01:07:20.519 --> 01:07:22.185
"Speak no evil."

01:07:24.602 --> 01:07:25.852
Good words.

01:07:28.519 --> 01:07:31.644
My little brother was "hear no evil."

01:07:32.227 --> 01:07:33.519
Who could have thought...

01:07:35.935 --> 01:07:37.686
Bianca was "see no evil."

01:07:39.519 --> 01:07:41.185
She was my sister.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.477
The girl you asked me about in the photo.

01:07:46.935 --> 01:07:49.769
We got the tattoos when we were kids.

01:07:51.769 --> 01:07:54.269
Called ourselves "The Three Kings."

01:07:55.769 --> 01:07:57.686
It was Bianca's idea.

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:03.018
Good thoughts, good words... good deeds.

01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:07.060
Bianca always saw the good in everything.

01:08:09.769 --> 01:08:12.144
What was your little brother's name?

01:08:13.144 --> 01:08:14.144
Isaac.

01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:17.602
He was so smart.

01:08:18.602 --> 01:08:20.185
Such a little prankster.

01:08:22.852 --> 01:08:24.519
So much so that...

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.977
he ended up in trouble...

01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:30.727
in prison.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.352
By the time he got out,
he had become affiliated

01:08:34.435 --> 01:08:36.477
with one of the Numbers gangs.

01:08:37.185 --> 01:08:43.060
With the gangs, in blood you go into them,
and only in blood do you get out.

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:47.768
After Isaac was killed...

01:08:48.394 --> 01:08:51.018
Bianca couldn't see any good
in the Cape Flats.

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:58.185
She blamed me for his death.
Said I should have been able to stop it.

01:09:01.852 --> 01:09:03.185
Maybe she was right.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.685
She met her husband, ran away.

01:09:12.435 --> 01:09:13.644
They came here.

01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:19.727
Maybe I should have been able
to stop that, too.

01:09:24.935 --> 01:09:26.519
Did you find her?

01:09:30.018 --> 01:09:32.269
I found her in the mortuary.

01:09:33.018 --> 01:09:35.144
She'd been beaten and tortured.

01:09:37.644 --> 01:09:39.018
I'm so sorry.

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:43.394
Do you think it's the same people
who beat you?

01:09:44.768 --> 01:09:45.644
Yeah.

01:09:46.893 --> 01:09:49.269
She didn't think she could come to me...

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:51.935
until it was too late.

01:09:53.352 --> 01:09:56.102
Maybe some people don't wanna be stopped.

01:10:18.726 --> 01:10:20.810
We're gonna give
the lieutenant a little concert.

01:10:22.185 --> 01:10:23.561
Can you hear me, Lieutenant?

01:10:24.685 --> 01:10:26.768
I want to ask you one question
and then you can go.

01:10:27.436 --> 01:10:29.602
What are you looking for?
Maybe I can help you.

01:10:29.685 --> 01:10:30.768
You've got nerve.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.644
- You like crazy drums, Lieutenant?
- You like crazy drums, Lieutenant?

01:11:07.602 --> 01:11:08.726
What happened, man?

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:16.227
Can you look at what's on this?

01:11:17.726 --> 01:11:18.977
Yeah, I can try.

01:11:23.768 --> 01:11:27.768
- It's a QuickTime file. A video.
- Yeah.

01:11:29.394 --> 01:11:32.768
- You know the password?
- No, I don't.

01:11:32.852 --> 01:11:35.436
Okay, it's encrypted,
and it's above my skill set,

01:11:35.519 --> 01:11:37.352
but I know a person who could hook you up.

01:11:37.436 --> 01:11:39.477
It'll just take two or three days.

01:11:40.144 --> 01:11:42.018
Maybe we can get to the audio.

01:12:00.018 --> 01:12:01.477
Armand...

01:12:01.561 --> 01:12:03.643
I want you to go with Mike.

01:12:04.185 --> 01:12:05.935
Mike will take care of you.

01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:13.935
Hi, Leary.

01:12:14.685 --> 01:12:18.018
I get to suck the nation's dick.

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:23.185
I don't know, man.
Sounds like some kind of porno.

01:12:31.893 --> 01:12:32.726
Sorry.

01:14:23.935 --> 01:14:25.726
I just got some news.

01:14:26.269 --> 01:14:29.476
That car King was driving
was registered in New Mexico.

01:14:30.643 --> 01:14:34.935
Kelly Johnson.
She's staying at the same motel King was.

01:14:35.018 --> 01:14:36.060
That's the news?

01:14:36.601 --> 01:14:38.685
- King stole her car?
- No.

01:14:39.269 --> 01:14:41.601
She never reported the car stolen.

01:14:42.977 --> 01:14:45.810
Hey, Earth to Boot. Yoo-hoo.

01:14:45.893 --> 01:14:48.893
I got pizza. You're crazy, come here.

01:14:48.977 --> 01:14:53.352
I don't want you watching so much TV.
You'll turn into a zombie.

01:14:53.435 --> 01:14:56.352
All right, there you go.
Do you want Sprite or Coke?

01:14:56.435 --> 01:14:59.102
- Um, Sprite.
- Sprite it is.

01:14:59.185 --> 01:15:00.810
Can I have some cookie dough after dinner?

01:15:00.893 --> 01:15:03.601
Uh, yeah, you can.

01:15:07.643 --> 01:15:09.726
Hey, I got pizza for you.

01:15:10.726 --> 01:15:15.227
It's pepperoni. So, wanna sit down?

01:15:16.601 --> 01:15:17.810
Do you want some beer?

01:15:17.893 --> 01:15:21.269
I don't actually have any,
but I could go pick some up.

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:23.893
Where are you going?

01:15:33.726 --> 01:15:35.685
Is this about Bianca?

01:15:43.351 --> 01:15:45.935
What difference
is it going to make to her now?

01:17:20.685 --> 01:17:23.060
Okay, see you in the morning, Scott.

01:17:23.144 --> 01:17:25.435
- Drive safe.
- All right, see you.

01:17:44.185 --> 01:17:46.351
Hey, Scott, you still here?

01:17:46.435 --> 01:17:49.518
I'm Bianca's brother. I'm in your office.

01:17:50.893 --> 01:17:54.893
I've got what you want,
and you've got what I want.

01:17:54.977 --> 01:17:55.977
How did you...

01:18:17.351 --> 01:18:18.268
So, where is it?

01:18:24.226 --> 01:18:25.226
Play it.

01:18:27.393 --> 01:18:28.596
Play it!

01:18:53.018 --> 01:18:54.351
It's okay, Mike.

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:57.060
Look at the camera.

01:18:58.393 --> 01:18:59.685
Tell me you love me.

01:19:00.685 --> 01:19:01.685
Tell me.

01:19:02.893 --> 01:19:04.518
I love you so much.

01:19:07.092 --> 01:19:09.517
What are you doing with the boy?

01:19:12.601 --> 01:19:14.351
This is why you killed her.

01:19:16.268 --> 01:19:20.184
Can you believe it? Leveraging me.

01:19:20.768 --> 01:19:24.143
She wanted the boy back
less than a week after she sold him to me.

01:19:25.226 --> 01:19:29.476
- Bianca sold you her kid?
- He wasn't her kid.

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:33.226
He belonged to her idiot husband
who got killed by his gangster pals.

01:19:33.309 --> 01:19:35.143
That's why they were pimping her out.

01:19:36.018 --> 01:19:37.935
To make the money back
that he stole from them.

01:19:40.351 --> 01:19:42.852
She sold me Armand to pay off the debt.

01:19:45.309 --> 01:19:47.435
Then the stupid bitch changed her mind.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.143
Armand's happy here.

01:19:57.893 --> 01:19:59.726
He's got friends. I've given him a home.

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:01.852
He was living on the street.

01:20:03.226 --> 01:20:04.768
I'm a decent guy.

01:20:06.685 --> 01:20:09.101
Bianca may have been strung out,
but we had a deal.

01:20:09.685 --> 01:20:11.476
What the fuck was she thinking?

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.060
That Armand would go back? To her?

01:20:18.351 --> 01:20:19.768
750, right?

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:24.101
That's what Wentworth said you wanted.

01:20:37.810 --> 01:20:39.685
You know the irony in all this?

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:44.685
Turns out you're the only straight dealer
in this whole goddamn mess.

01:20:45.268 --> 01:20:47.977
Okay. Just... Just take a breath.

01:20:49.059 --> 01:20:50.309
Just breathe for a minute.

01:20:51.518 --> 01:20:56.768
Breaking and entering, self-defense,
plus you're black.

01:21:02.852 --> 01:21:05.101
Except you're lying!

01:21:05.184 --> 01:21:07.351
Hey, Mike, I left my phone somewhere.

01:21:10.059 --> 01:21:11.226
Oh, God.

01:21:11.893 --> 01:21:13.309
Please! Please, what do you want?

01:21:15.184 --> 01:21:18.726
Help! Mike! Mike, help!

01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:21.476
- No! No!
- Sit!

01:21:22.726 --> 01:21:25.852
Please don't.
Don't do anything to me, please.

01:21:26.351 --> 01:21:27.643
Please, I don't have anything.

01:21:39.759 --> 01:21:41.938
Only what I tell you.

01:21:42.017 --> 01:21:45.476
Mike shot himself. The safe is open.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.268
There's money everywhere. Now tell him.

01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:51.268
Scott? What's wrong? What is it?

01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:53.601
I walked into Mike's office
and he's killed himself.

01:21:54.435 --> 01:21:56.476
He blew his brains out.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.976
There's money all over the place.

01:21:59.059 --> 01:22:01.810
You've got to get over here, Paul.
You better get over...

01:22:33.852 --> 01:22:35.226
Mr. Ducmajian.

01:22:35.893 --> 01:22:39.893
This is Jacob King. I'm at Preston's.

01:22:39.976 --> 01:22:41.643
Dr. Wentworth is on his way.

01:24:07.101 --> 01:24:09.101
I'm Jacob, Bianca's brother.

01:24:11.601 --> 01:24:13.851
I'm going to take you to a safe place.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.810
Get away from me!

01:24:15.892 --> 01:24:18.601
Get dressed. We don't have much time.

01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:22.560
Trust me. I am your friend.

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:26.685
King. His name... His name is King.

01:24:27.726 --> 01:24:30.309
He killed Mike. He did it. He killed him.

01:24:31.393 --> 01:24:34.184
Oh, God. Paul, thank God you came.

01:24:34.268 --> 01:24:36.726
You gotta cut me loose.
We gotta get out of here.

01:24:41.393 --> 01:24:43.768
We gotta get out of here!

01:24:43.851 --> 01:24:45.268
Paul!

01:24:47.976 --> 01:24:49.518
We gotta get out of here!

01:24:51.435 --> 01:24:53.809
Paul. Paul, help me. Help me.

01:24:58.851 --> 01:25:00.101
Come here, you gotta help me.

01:25:00.184 --> 01:25:04.726
Cut me loose. Please.
We gotta get out of here.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:08.435
What are you... What are you doing? Please.

01:25:40.809 --> 01:25:42.143
Dr. Wentworth?

01:25:45.767 --> 01:25:47.226
You want to stay for dinner?

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:48.476
No.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.393
You're going to die if you stay here.

01:25:51.476 --> 01:25:53.326
I have to get back.

01:26:09.059 --> 01:26:10.476
What's going on?

01:26:10.976 --> 01:26:13.143
Wait. No, you wait here.

01:26:13.226 --> 01:26:14.685
Get him.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.393
Zico...

01:27:02.934 --> 01:27:05.518
Duke, you've gotta believe me.
I was going to split it.

01:27:06.309 --> 01:27:10.643
He called me. King. He told me you'd be here.

01:27:23.143 --> 01:27:24.560
The bag was just lying there.

01:27:24.643 --> 01:27:27.518
I was wondering where this was.

01:27:41.725 --> 01:27:44.601
Motherfucker! Fuck!

01:27:55.809 --> 01:27:57.476
Okay, sit right here.

01:28:10.976 --> 01:28:14.101
Where is your mother?
We have to leave here right away.

01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:18.226
Stop it!

01:28:22.892 --> 01:28:24.618
Go to your room!

01:28:30.435 --> 01:28:32.892
Are you happy to see me, Mr. King?

01:28:33.661 --> 01:28:36.393
Mommy! Mommy!

01:28:41.143 --> 01:28:42.892
No!

01:28:54.268 --> 01:28:55.600
No!

01:29:03.892 --> 01:29:05.228
Mommy!

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.642
Armand!

01:29:44.725 --> 01:29:45.767
Armand!

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.600
Armand?

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.684
Armand!

01:31:29.809 --> 01:31:31.059
All aboard, ma'am.

01:33:12.268 --> 01:33:14.600
Welcome back, detective.

01:33:14.684 --> 01:33:16.809
- How was your holiday?
- All right.

01:33:16.892 --> 01:33:17.809
I'll grab your bag.

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:20.059
Did you get to see your sister
in Los Angeles?

01:33:20.143 --> 01:33:21.517
Yeah, I did.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:22.684
And how's she doing?

01:33:23.851 --> 01:33:25.662
She's doing fine.
