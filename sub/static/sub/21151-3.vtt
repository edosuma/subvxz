I WANT TO CHOP HER IN HALF
>> MEGAN TARGETED YOU WITH THAT.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.096
YOU KNOW THAT
>> YEAH.

16:03.130 --> 16:11.838
>> GOT A BIG MOUTH.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.607
>> I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.645
MEGAN ACCUSING ME OF BEING
RACIST IS BEYOND AGGRAVATING.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.613
THAT ISN'T JUST A GAME MOVE.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.814
IT'S A PERSONAL ATTACK.

16:21.848 --> 16:25.052
I'M GOING TO TALK TO ALEX AND
SET THINGS STRAIGHT WITH HER

16:25.085 --> 16:27.920
>> WHAT TRANSPIRED WITH MEGAN
>> SHE SAID THAT YOU GUYS WERE

16:27.954 --> 16:30.557
LIKE TALKING -- I DON'T CARE
IT'S A GAME

16:30.590 --> 16:35.762
>> RAVEN TOLD ME TO SIT NEXT TO
CODY AND FLIRT AND I SAID I'M

16:35.795 --> 16:38.831
NOT GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE
HE'S TALKING TO YOU.

16:38.865 --> 16:44.904
>> I BELIEVE THAT SHE WENT AND
MANIPULATED HOW I SAID THAT.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.308
I BELIEVE THAT SHE KNOW THAT SHE
IS ON THE BLOCK AND GOING HOME

16:48.341 --> 16:52.645
AND TRYING TO MAKE SOMEONE ELSE
A TARGET, SO TRYING TO GET YOU

16:52.679 --> 16:54.847
AND I TO ARGUE.

16:54.881 --> 17:01.754
>> DUDE, SO, MEGAN STARTED OUT
AS MY CLOSEST CONFIDENT HOUSE,

17:01.788 --> 17:06.993
WHEN JESSICA TELLS ME SHE DIDN'T
SAY THE RACIAL SLUR I TOTALLY

17:07.026 --> 17:07.660
BELIEVE HER.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.529
WE'RE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.264
EVERYONE CAN SEE IT.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.866
SHE WOULDN'T COME TO ME AND TELL
ME IT WAS FALSE.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.304
>> SHE IS LITERALLY TRYING TO
PUT TARGETS ON OTHER PEOPLE'S

17:17.337 --> 17:20.573
BACK TO TAKE ATTENTION AWAY FROM
HER SHE KNOWS SHE'S GOING HOME

17:20.607 --> 17:22.709
AND THIS IS OUR LAST PLAY.

17:22.742 --> 17:23.610
>> MY GOD.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.813
>> EVERYONE IS IN THE BACKYARD
RIGHT NOW.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.816
>> DEAR GOD.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.918
>> I AM LIVID.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.821
YOU CAN'T GO AROUND CALLING
SOMEONE A RACIST.

17:34.854 --> 17:38.791
SHE COULDN'T RUINED JESSICA'S
LIFE AND MINE AND SHE GETS AWAY

17:38.825 --> 17:39.792
WITH IT?

17:39.826 --> 17:41.328
NO, SHE'S NOT GETTING AWAY WITH
THAT

17:41.361 --> 17:44.531
>> DUDE, WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS
NOT COOL.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.166
STOP TELLING LIES
>> I HAVEN'T.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.202
>> DUDE, YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT
RACIST COMMENTS

17:49.236 --> 17:52.605
>> I DID NOT MAKE IT UP
>> SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT TO

17:52.639 --> 17:55.342
GO OVER THERE BECAUSE PANDA WAS
OVER THERE.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.010
>> I NEVER USED THE TERM PANDA
IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.246
>> WHEN I TOLD HER THAT.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.249
>> I NEVER CALLED HER A PANDA.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.116
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

18:03.150 --> 18:07.454
I HAVE NEVER CALLED HER A PANDA
BE EVER.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.455
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:08.488 --> 18:12.459
>> PEOPLE ARE SAYING I'M LYING,
MAKING STUFF UP.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.362
WHEN I KNOW I'M NOT
>> LIED ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.264
I HEARD YOU SAY PANDA.

18:17.297 --> 18:21.501
WAS ANYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE
EVER HEARD ME CALL ALEX A PANDA?

18:21.534 --> 18:23.236
>> I KNOW I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.539
I LITERALLY LAID THERE AND HEARD
HERE SAY IT.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.109
I DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF
ACCUSING SOMEONE OF SAYING

18:30.143 --> 18:31.544
RACIST STUFF WHEN I KNOW THEY
SAID IT.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.880
AND THEN EVERYONE THINKING THAT
I MADE IT UP.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.783
>> YOU TOLD ME IT WAS RACIST.

18:36.816 --> 18:40.420
>> I WAS LIKE, NO
>> YOU STEP ON EVERYONE'S TOES,

18:40.453 --> 18:41.421
IT'S DONE.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.291
DON'T TALK TO ME, WE'RE NOT
FRIENDS, IT'S DONE.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.658
>> SERIOUSLY.

18:45.692 --> 18:55.735
>> I HAVE NEVER MET A DUMBER
HUMAN BEING.

18:55.735 --> 19:03.276
>> I HAVE NEVER MET A DUMBER
HUMAN BEING.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.911
>> HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

19:04.944 --> 19:05.878
EVERYBODY.

19:05.912 --> 19:10.417
GUYS COME ON, WE'RE HAVING A
GOOD TIME, MAN

19:10.450 --> 19:17.490
>> MOVING ON.

19:17.524 --> 19:17.990
* .

19:18.024 --> 19:19.125
* .

19:19.158 --> 19:21.060
>> SHE MADE SOMEONE LOOK LIKE A
RACIST.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.530
YOU KNOW HOW BAD THAT WILL LOOK
ON HER?

19:23.563 --> 19:26.499
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SHE LIKE
MADE UP THAT WHOLE STORY

19:26.533 --> 19:29.802
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW BAD THAT IS
FOR US NOW?

19:29.836 --> 19:32.439
>> THEN YOU RUN OUT THERE?

19:32.472 --> 19:35.074
>> I'M NOT.

19:35.107 --> 19:39.346
>> NOT BEING ANYWHERE NEAR THE
BITCH.

19:39.379 --> 19:43.816
>> THE WHOLE THING WITH JOSH,
THE BLOW-UP THERE, ALEX TELLING

19:43.850 --> 19:48.154
EVERYONE A BUNCH OF STUFF, NO
ONE WILL BELIEVE ME.

19:48.187 --> 19:58.231
NO ONE TRUSTS ME.

19:58.231 --> 20:04.170
NO ONE TRUSTS ME.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.038
I TRIED TO CALM DOWN, DRINK
WATER.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.942
BUT I JUST, I COULDN'T, I'M
SHAKING.

20:09.976 --> 20:15.114
I'M SHAKING.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.617
THIS IS SO HURTFUL.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.919
I BELIEVE I'M A GOOD PERSON.

20:19.952 --> 20:25.992
I THINK I'M GOOD AND NICE TO
PEOPLE.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.327
I DON'T KNOW.

20:27.360 --> 20:37.404
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE
THIS.

20:37.404 --> 20:47.146
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE
THIS.

20:47.179 --> 20:51.518
I CAN'T DO THIS.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.336
>> 12:05.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.739
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN IN THERE?

21:12.772 --> 21:15.375
>> OVER AN HOUR EASILY.

21:15.408 --> 21:22.782
>> SHE PUT DEPRESSION ON THE
HOUSE, SHE CRIED WHEN ANY

21:22.815 --> 21:23.983
NOMINATED HER.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.486
THERE'S ONE PERSON THAT DOESN'T
LIKE HER AND SHE CRIED NOW

21:26.519 --> 21:29.288
EVERYONE DOESN'T
>> I DIDN'T WANT HER TO CRY.

21:29.322 --> 21:37.630
I HOPE SHE'S NOT CRYING.

21:37.664 --> 21:43.302

MEGAN IS NOT COMING BACK AND I
FEEL SORRY FOR HER, IT'S

23:32.445 --> 23:33.680
DIFFICULT.

23:33.713 --> 23:37.550
I'M THINKING I JUST HOPE SHE'S
ALL RIGHT

23:37.584 --> 23:43.255
>> SINCE MEGAN WAS NOMINATED I
WILL HAVE TO NAME A NEW NOMINEE

23:43.289 --> 23:44.023
TOMORROW.

SO CODY HAS TO MAKE ANOTHER
DECISION, COULD BE ME AND I'M

23:50.697 --> 23:51.998

24:03.910 --> 24:05.377
PEOPLE ON MY ALLIANCE.

24:05.411 --> 24:08.648
IT'S HARD
>> SORRY TO BE THE ONE TO DO IT.

24:08.681 --> 24:09.882
